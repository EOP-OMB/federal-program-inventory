The Corps also applies the conclusions that it derives from these analyses to improve the hydrologic engineering techniques that it uses in the planning, design, construction, and operation of water resources projects. The program consists of four sub items:

• Storm Studies: The Corps uses these funds to gather comprehensive rainfall data in order to refine regional hydro-meteorological information throughout the nation. This up-to-date hydro-meteorological information informs Corps water resources studies, and supports the design of proposed projects.
• General Hydrologic Studies: The Corps uses these funds to analyze rainfall runoff relationships; to estimate flood frequencies; and in snowmelt studies, hydrograph development and routing at selected watersheds, model calibrations in urban areas, analyses of past floods, the development of methods for the hydraulic analysis of non-gauged streams, and other studies of a related hydrologic nature.
• Sedimentation Studies: The Corps uses these funds in non-project sedimentation studies, and for the Corps share of the cost of the cooperative Interagency Sedimentation Project at the Hydraulics Laboratory, Waterways Experiment Station.

On inland waterways, the Corps will collect more accurate survey and mapping data than is currently on its paper charts, and produce inland electronic navigation charts (IENCs) in accordance with navigation users and ECS vendors.  When combined in the commercial ECS, the technology will greatly improve the safety and efficiency of navigation.  This will allow safe navigation through bridge openings during fog and other bad weather conditions as well as during heavy traffic situations, and provide an accurate display for other systems such as radar and Automatic Identification Systems.  The Corps will use the S-57 international data format, the electronic data transfer standard prepared by the International Hydrographic Organization committee.  The S-57 format is consistent with electronic chart products produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the chart products produced by the two agencies will be coordinated for compatibility in adjoining areas.  The Corps will also coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard for aids to navigation information and collaboration on rules for chart carriage by waterway users.
