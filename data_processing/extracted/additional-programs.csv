TC.001,Exclusion of benefits and allowances to armed forces personnel ,"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. For example, a rental voucher of $100 is (approximately) equal in value to $100 of cash income. In contrast to this treatment, certain housing and meals, in addition to other benefits provided military personnel, either in cash or in kind, as well as certain amounts of pay related to combat service, are excluded from income subject to tax.",Department of the Treasury,Internal Revenue Service (IRS),Tax Expenditures,National Defense,tax_expenditure,Tax Expenditure,0,14830000000,0,1599000000,0,16910000000,0,17570000000

It makes no difference whether the compensation is a result of working abroad or whether it is labeled as a housing allowance. In contrast to this treatment, U.S. tax law allows U.S. citizens and residents who live abroad, work in the private sector, and satisfy a foreign residency requirement to exclude up to $80,000, plus adjustments for inflation since 2004, in foreign earned income from U.S. taxes. In addition, if these taxpayers are provided housing by their employers, then they may also exclude the cost of such housing from their income to the extent that it exceeds 16 percent of the earned income exclusion limit. This housing exclusion is capped at 30 percent of the earned income exclusion limit, with geographical adjustments. If taxpayers do not receive a specific allowance for housing expenses, they may deduct housing expenses up to the amount by which foreign earned income exceeds their foreign earned income exclusion.",Department of the Treasury,Internal Revenue Service (IRS),Tax Expenditures,International Affairs,tax_expenditure,Tax Expenditure,0,6700000000,0,5420000000,0,5500000000,0,5620000000

It makes no difference whether the compensation is a result of working abroad or whether it is labeled as an allowance for the high cost of living abroad. In contrast to this treatment, U.S. Federal civilian employees and Peace Corps members who work outside the continental United States are allowed to exclude from U.S. taxable income certain special allowances they receive to compensate them for the relatively high costs associated with living overseas.

TC.004,Reduced tax rate on active income of controlled foreign corporations (normal tax method),"Under the baseline tax system, worldwide income forms the tax base of U.S. corporations. In contrast, U.S. tax law exempts or preferentially taxes certain portions of this income. Prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA (effective January 1, 2018), active foreign income was generally taxed only upon repatriation. TCJA changed these rules, so that certain active income (called “global intangible low tax income” or “GILTI”) is taxed currently, even if it is not distributed. However, U.S. corporations generally receive a 50 percent deduction from U.S. tax on their GILTI (the deduction decreases to 37.5 percent in 2026), resulting in a substantially reduced rate of tax. In addition, some active income is excluded from tax, and distributions out of active income are no longer taxed upon repatriation. These reductions and exemptions from U.S. taxation are considered tax expenditures.",Department of the Treasury,Internal Revenue Service (IRS),Tax Expenditures,International Affairs,tax_expenditure,Tax Expenditure,0,30540000000,0,45190000000,0,36060000000,0,37140000000

TC.007,Expensing of research and experimentation expenditures (normal tax method) ,"The baseline tax system allows a deduction for the cost of producing income. It requires taxpayers to capitalize the costs associated with investments over time to better match the streams of income and associated costs. Research and experimentation (R&E) projects can be viewed as investments because, if successful, their benefits accrue for several years. It is often difficult, however, to identify whether a specific R&E project is successful and, if successful, what its expected life will be. Because of this ambiguity, the reference tax law baseline system would allow expensing of R&E expenditures. In contrast, under the normal tax method, the expensing of R&E expenditures is viewed as a tax expenditure. The baseline assumed for the normal tax method is that all R&E expenditures are successful and have an expected life of five years. Current law requires R&E expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, to be capitalized and amortized over 5 years, while allowing R&E expenditures paid or incurred in prior taxable years to be expensed.",Department of the Treasury,Internal Revenue Service (IRS),Tax Expenditures,"General Science, Space, and Technology",tax_expenditure,Tax Expenditure,0,-19820000000,0,-38660000000,0,-25050000000,0,-17360000000
TC.008,Credit for increasing research activities ,"The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an R&E credit of up to 20 percent of qualified research expenditures in excess of a base amount. The base amount of the credit is generally determined by multiplying a “fixed-base percentage” by the average amount of the company’s gross receipts for the prior four years. The taxpayer’s fixed base percentage generally is the ratio of its research expenses to gross receipts for 1984 through 1988. Taxpayers can elect the alternative simplified credit regime, which equals 14 percent of qualified research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average qualified research expenses for the three preceding taxable years.",Department of the Treasury,Internal Revenue Service (IRS),Tax Expenditures,"General Science, Space, and Technology",tax_expenditure,Tax Expenditure,0,23260000000,0,28220000000,0,30040000000,0,31890000000
TC.009,"Expensing of exploration and development costs, oil and gas","Under the baseline tax system, the costs of exploring and developing oil and gas wells would be capitalized and then amortized (or depreciated) over an estimate of the economic life of the property. This ensures that the net income from the well or mine is measured appropriately each year. In contrast to this treatment, current law allows the immediate deduction, i.e., expensing, of intangible drilling costs for successful investments in domestic oil and gas wells (such as wages, the cost of using machinery for grading and drilling, and the cost of unsalvageable materials used in constructing wells). Because expensing allows recovery of costs sooner, it is more advantageous to the taxpayer than amortization. Expensing provisions for exploration expenditures apply only to properties for which a deduction for percentage depletion is allowable. For oil and gas wells, integrated oil companies may expense only 70 percent of intangible drilling costs and must amortize the remaining 30 percent over five years. Non-integrated oil companies may expense all such costs.",Department of the Treasury,Internal Revenue Service (IRS),Tax Expenditures,Energy,tax_expenditure,Tax Expenditure,0,720000000,0,700000000,0,550000000,0,400000000

TC.011,"Excess of percentage over cost depletion, oil and gas","The baseline tax system would allow recovery of the costs of developing certain oil and gas properties using cost depletion. Cost depletion is similar in concept to depreciation, in that the costs of developing or acquiring the asset are capitalized and then gradually reduced over an estimate of the asset’s economic life, as is appropriate for measuring net income. In contrast, the Tax Code generally allows independent oil and gas producers and royalty owners to take percentage depletion deductions rather than cost depletion on limited quantities of output. Under percentage depletion, taxpayers deduct a percentage of gross income from oil and gas production. In certain cases the deduction is limited to a fraction of the asset’s net income. Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion may provide more advantageous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which limits deductions to an investment’s cost.",Department of the Treasury,Internal Revenue Service (IRS),Tax Expenditures,Energy,tax_expenditure,Tax Expenditure,0,910000000,0,1530000000,0,1400000000,0,1480000000

TC.013,Exception from passive loss limitation for working interests in oil and gas properties ,"The baseline tax system accepts current law’s general rule limiting taxpayers’ ability to deduct losses from passive activities against nonpassive income (e.g., wages, interest, and dividends). Passive activities generally are defined as those in which the taxpayer does not materially participate, though there are numerous additional considerations brought to bear on the determination of which activities are passive for a given taxpayer. Losses are limited in an attempt to limit tax sheltering activities. Passive losses that are unused may be carried forward and applied against future passive income. An exception from the passive loss limitation is provided for a working interest in an oil or gas property that the taxpayer holds directly or through an entity that does not limit the liability of the taxpayer with respect to the interest. Thus, taxpayers can deduct losses from such working interests against nonpassive income without regard to whether they materially participate in the activity.",Department of the Treasury,Internal Revenue Service (IRS),Tax Expenditures,Energy,tax_expenditure,Tax Expenditure,0,10000000,0,10000000,0,0,0,0

A marginal well is one that does not produce more than 1,095 barrel-of-oil equivalents per year, with this limit adjusted proportionately for the number of days the well is in production in a given year. The credit is no more than $3.00 per barrel of qualified crude oil production and $0.50 per thousand cubic feet of qualified natural gas production. The credit for natural gas is reduced in proportion to the amount by which the reference price of natural gas at the wellhead for the previous calendar year exceeds $1.67 per thousand cubic feet and is zero for a reference price that exceeds $2.00. The credit for crude oil is reduced in proportion to the amount by which the reference price of oil for the previous calendar year exceeds $15.00 per barrel and is zero for a reference price that exceeds $18.00.

TC.016,Amortize all geological and geophysical expenditures over 2 years,"The baseline tax system allows taxpayers to deduct the decline in the economic value of an investment over its economic life.

TC.165,"Exclusion of social security benefits: Social Security benefits for retired and disabled workers and spouses, dependents and survivors","The baseline tax system would tax Social Security benefits to the extent that contributions to Social Security were not previously taxed. Thus, the portion of Social Security benefits that is attributable to employer contributions and to earnings on employer and employee contributions (and not attributable to employee contributions which are taxed at the time of contribution) would be subject to tax. In contrast, the Tax Code may not tax all of the Social Security benefits that exceed the beneficiary’s contributions from previously taxed income. Actuarially, previously taxed contributions generally do not exceed 15 percent of benefits, even for retirees receiving the highest levels of benefits. Therefore, up to 85 percent of recipients’ Social Security and Railroad Social Security Equivalent retirement benefits are included in (phased into) the income tax base if the recipient’s provisional income exceeds certain base amounts. (Provisional income is equal to other items included in adjusted gross income plus foreign or U.S. possession income, tax-exempt interest, and one half of Social Security and Railroad Social Security Equivalent retirement benefits.) The untaxed portion of the benefits received by taxpayers who are below the income amounts at which 85 percent of the benefits are taxable is counted as a tax expenditure.
