# Federal Program Inventory

## About the inventory
The [Federal Program Inventory (FPI)](https://fpi.omb.gov/) is a comprehensive, searchable tool with critical information about all Federal programs that provide grants, loans, or direct payments to individuals, governments, firms or other organizations. The FPI increases government transparency and accessibility and fulfills Congressional mandates to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to create and publicly post an inventory.

## About the repository
This repository contains two sub-directories: `data_extract`, which is focused on gathering and processing the underlying data, and `website`, which is focused on generating the public-facing website. See the README.md files in each of these directories for more information.
