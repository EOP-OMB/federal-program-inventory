The Education Service has responsibility for: readjustment education benefits for post-Vietnam era veterans and recently-discharged veterans, as well as educational assistance for spouses, surviving spouses, and children of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled or die from disability incurred or aggravated in active service in the Armed forces, or are currently prisoners of war or missing in action.  In addition, certain members of the selected Reserve or National Guard are also eligible for education benefits administered by the Service.

We support the building of an infrastructure for evidence-based education through activities such as grants to states to develop longitudinal data systems. We disseminate evidence on education to the public and practitioners through the What Works Clearinghouse and the ERIC education database, conferences, publications and products and 10 regional education laboratories and 10 national research and development centers.", "hierarchy": [], "orgLegacyList": [{"org_key": 100500126, "legacy_id": "b14549c331b37170ea9c36ee3dbb7deb", "legacy_name": "INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES", "created_by": "IAE-DATATeam", "created_date": "2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308", "last_modified_by": "IAE_DATETeam", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308", "legacy_system_name": "CFDA", "legacy_key": 1602, "source": null}], "parentOrg": "EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF", "l1Name": "EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF", "l2Name": "INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES", "l1OrgKey": 100001616, "l2OrgKey": 100500126, "links": [], "isSourceCfda": true, "isSourceCwCfda": true},{"orgKey": 100171765, "name": "NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES", "type": "DEPARTMENT", "fullParentPath": "100171765", "createdDate": "2016-04-01T04:00:00.000+00:00", "lastModifiedBy": "FPDS_START_DATE_FIX", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-14T22:41:18.399+00:00", "fullParentPathName": "NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES", "startDate": "2018-10-01T04:00:00.000+00:00", "agencyName": "National Endowment for the Humanities", "tas2Code": "43", "fpdsCode": "4340", "cfdaCode": "45", "ombAgencyCode": "418", "modStatus": "ACTIVE", "cgac": "418", "level": 1, "fpdsOrgId": "5940", "l1ShortName": "NEH", "cfdaBur": 0, "cfdaOmb": 418, "description": "Promotes and supports the production and dissemination of knowledge in the humanities.

Since 1901, NIST, a non-regulatory agency, has been supplying the measurements and tools\u2014from standardized high-precision gage blocks needed to manufacture interchangeable parts to the world\u2019s most accurate atomic clock\u2014to help U.S. industry compete successfully through innovation. Over the last few decades, NIST has been assigned important new roles and responsibilities, including awarding competitive grants to foster development of promising, high-risk technologies; diffusing advanced technologies and business practices to smaller manufacturers; and promoting quality management methods in key sectors.  Old and new, all NIST programs support the nation\u2019s agility, innovation, and competitiveness./nNIST Laboratory Program - For more than 100 years, NIST has maintained the national standards of measurement, a role that the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Federal Government. Today, the NIST Laboratories address increasingly complex measurement challenges. For example, NIST develops measurements focusing on the very small (e.g., nanotechnology devices) and the very large (e.g., skyscrapers), the physical\u2014methods for characterizing strands of DNA for forensic testing and the virtual\u2014methods for testing electronic health record systems, and tests the performance of walk-through metal detectors. The NIST Laboratories work at the frontiers of measurement science to ensure that the U.S. system of measurements is firmly grounded on a sound scientific and technical foundation. NIST promotes the use of measurements based on the international system of units (SI). The measurement science research at NIST is useful to all science and engineering disciplines. The NIST Laboratories work to assure that the U.S. realization of the basic and derived measurement units is consistent with the realization in other nations. NIST Laboratories engage in a number of international activities to support trade and global science, and to promote the international acceptance of U.S. measurement standards. The NIST Laboratories provide industry and academia with unique user facilities that support innovation in materials science, nanotechnology, and other emerging technology areas through the NIST Center for Neutron Research, which provides world class neutron measurement capabilities to the U.S. research community, and the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, which supports nanotechnology development from discovery to production. The NIST Laboratories also support the development of standards and specifications that define technical and performance requirements for goods and services. These standards\u2014also known as documentary standards\u2014are often developed collaboratively with the private sector through an open, consensus-based process. NIST scientists and engineers lend their expertise to these efforts in order to promote standards that are based on sound science, and to ensure that the standards are supported by effective measurements and testing methods for conformity. In addition, NIST is designated under the National Technology Transfer Advancement Act (NTTAA) as the coordinator for all Federal agencies using documentary standards that are developed by private-sector consensus bodies to carry out their policy objectives./nInnovation and Industry Services Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership - Through partnerships between Federal and state governments and non-profit organizations, NIST\u2019s Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) provides technical and business assistance to smaller manufacturers through a nationwide network in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Field agents and programs are helping manufacturers understand, adopt, and apply new technologies and business practices, as well as reap the benefits through increased productivity, better performance, cost savings, waste reduction, and creation and retention of manufacturing jobs. MEP acts as a strategic advisor to promote business growth and innovation and to connect manufacturers to public and private resources essential for increased profitability and competitiveness in the global marketplace./nTechnology Innovation Program (TIP) - The TIP statute originated in the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Sciences (COMPETES) Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69). The COMPETES Act was recently reauthorized as the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358).   TIP was established to help U.S. businesses, institutions of higher education, and other organizations\u2014such as national laboratories and nonprofit research institutes\u2014to support, promote, and accelerate innovation in the United States through high-risk, high-reward research in areas of critical national need.    The final FY 2012 appropriations did not provide funding for TIP.  The program is currently implementing an orderly close down of the program. /nBaldrige Performance Excellence Program (BPEP) - NIST\u2019s Baldrige Performance Excellence Program (BPEP) provides global leadership in the learning and sharing of successful strategies and performance practices, principles, and methodologies to strengthen U.S. organizations. The program promotes organizational excellence through education, outreach, and an annual Presidential awards program. The Baldrige Award is given to organizations in six categories: manufacturing, service, small business, health care, education, and nonprofit. BPEP works closely with these organizations to recognize and disseminate proven best practices for management and operation, leading to organizations that are more strategic, innovative, competitive, and effective. BPEP also takes advantage of more than 20 years worth of learning from Baldrige Award recipients to identify strategies and practices that are most likely to strengthen the performance and competitiveness of U.S. industry and other organizations.  /n", "shortName": "NIST", "sourceCfdaPk": "7faa9909ffacb9b5e70c1c393f9ee720", "sourceParentCfdaPk": "eb778728054c2bb65dab9a6138e024c9", "summary": "The NIST mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.

For example, NIST develops measurements focusing on the very small (e.g., nanotechnology devices) and the very large (e.g., skyscrapers), the physical\u2014methods for characterizing strands of DNA for forensic testing and the virtual\u2014methods for testing electronic health record systems, and tests the performance of walk-through metal detectors. The NIST Laboratories work at the frontiers of measurement science to ensure that the U.S. system of measurements is firmly grounded on a sound scientific and technical foundation. NIST promotes the use of measurements based on the international system of units (SI). The measurement science research at NIST is useful to all science and engineering disciplines. The NIST Laboratories work to assure that the U.S. realization of the basic and derived measurement units is consistent with the realization in other nations. NIST Laboratories engage in a number of international activities to support trade and global science, and to promote the international acceptance of U.S. measurement standards. The NIST Laboratories provide industry and academia with unique user facilities that support innovation in materials science, nanotechnology, and other emerging technology areas through the NIST Center for Neutron Research, which provides world class neutron measurement capabilities to the U.S. research community, and the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, which supports nanotechnology development from discovery to production. The NIST Laboratories also support the development of standards and specifications that define technical and performance requirements for goods and services. These standards\u2014also known as documentary standards\u2014are often developed collaboratively with the private sector through an open, consensus-based process. NIST scientists and engineers lend their expertise to these efforts in order to promote standards that are based on sound science, and to ensure that the standards are supported by effective measurements and testing methods for conformity. In addition, NIST is designated under the National Technology Transfer Advancement Act (NTTAA) as the coordinator for all Federal agencies using documentary standards that are developed by private-sector consensus bodies to carry out their policy objectives./nInnovation and Industry Services Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership - Through partnerships between Federal and state governments and non-profit organizations, NIST\u2019s Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) provides technical and business assistance to smaller manufacturers through a nationwide network in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Field agents and programs are helping manufacturers understand, adopt, and apply new technologies and business practices, as well as reap the benefits through increased productivity, better performance, cost savings, waste reduction, and creation and retention of manufacturing jobs. MEP acts as a strategic advisor to promote business growth and innovation and to connect manufacturers to public and private resources essential for increased profitability and competitiveness in the global marketplace./nTechnology Innovation Program (TIP) - The TIP statute originated in the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Sciences (COMPETES) Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69). The COMPETES Act was recently reauthorized as the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358).   TIP was established to help U.S. businesses, institutions of higher education, and other organizations\u2014such as national laboratories and nonprofit research institutes\u2014to support, promote, and accelerate innovation in the United States through high-risk, high-reward research in areas of critical national need.    The final FY 2012 appropriations did not provide funding for TIP.  The program is currently implementing an orderly close down of the program. /nBaldrige Performance Excellence Program (BPEP) - NIST\u2019s Baldrige Performance Excellence Program (BPEP) provides global leadership in the learning and sharing of successful strategies and performance practices, principles, and methodologies to strengthen U.S. organizations. The program promotes organizational excellence through education, outreach, and an annual Presidential awards program. The Baldrige Award is given to organizations in six categories: manufacturing, service, small business, health care, education, and nonprofit. BPEP works closely with these organizations to recognize and disseminate proven best practices for management and operation, leading to organizations that are more strategic, innovative, competitive, and effective. BPEP also takes advantage of more than 20 years worth of learning from Baldrige Award recipients to identify strategies and practices that are most likely to strengthen the performance and competitiveness of U.S. industry and other organizations.  /n", "code": "1341", "categoryDesc": "AGENCY", "orgCode": "ORG-2212", "hierarchy": [], "orgAddresses": [{"address_key": 100272426, "org_key": 100109529, "street_address": "", "street_address_2": null, "city": "", "state": "", "zipcode": "", "country_code": "US", "created_by": "1125d89c272cdf8459b8e1946727a25c", "created_date": "2012-07-20T18:10:04", "last_modified_by": "1125d89c272cdf8459b8e1946727a25c", "last_modified_date": "2012-07-20T18:10:04", "mod_status": "active", "is_source_fpds": null, "is_source_cfda": true, "is_source_fh_app": null, "type": "M"}], "orgLegacyList": [{"org_key": 100109529, "legacy_id": "7faa9909ffacb9b5e70c1c393f9ee720", "legacy_name": "NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY", "created_by": "IAE-DATATeam", "created_date": "2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308", "last_modified_by": "IAE_DATETeam", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308", "legacy_system_name": "CFDA", "legacy_key": 1431, "source": null}, {"org_key": 100109529, "legacy_id": "7faa9909ffacb9b5e70c1c393f9ee720", "legacy_name": "NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY", "created_by": "FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING", "created_date": "2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808", "last_modified_by": "FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING", "last_modified_date": "2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808", "legacy_system_name": "FBO", "legacy_key": 4596, "source": null}], "parentOrg": "COMMERCE, DEPARTMENT OF", "l1OrgKey": 100035122, "l2OrgKey": 100109529, "l1Name": "COMMERCE, DEPARTMENT OF", "l2Name": "NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY", "links": [], "isSourceCfda": true, "isSourceCwCfda": true, "isSourceFpds": true},{"orgKey": 100186697, "name": "OFFICE OF POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION", "type": "OFFICE", "parentOrgKey": 300000348, "fullParentPath": "100001616.300000348.100186697", "createdBy": "FH-RE-INGESTION", "createdDate": "2016-04-02T03:02:09.000+00:00", "lastModifiedBy": "IAE_25286_Old_Code_Mapping", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-11-01T21:18:21.970+00:00", "fullParentPathName": "EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF.EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF.OFFICE OF POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION", "aacCode": "910034", "startDate": "2016-04-02T03:02:09.000+00:00", "agencyName": "Office of Postsecondary Education", "fpdsCode": "9100", "cfdaCode": "84", "a11TacCode": "40", "modStatus": "ACTIVE", "cgac": "091", "level": 3, "fpdsOrgId": "EP", "l1ShortName": "ED", "regionCode": "HQ", "cfdaBur": 40, "cfdaOmb": 18, "description": "The Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education formulates policy, directs, and coordinates programs for assistance to postsecondary educational institutions and students pursuing a postsecondary education.

The Library's extensive collections are universal in scope. They include books and pamphlets on every subject and in a multitude of languages. Among them are the most comprehensive collections of Chinese, Japanese, and Russian language books outside Asia and the Soviet Union; volumes relating to science and legal materials, outstanding for American and foreign law; the world's largest collection of published aeronautical literature; and the most extensive collection in the western hemisphere of books printed before 1501 A.D. The manuscript collections relate to manifold aspects of American history and civilization and include the personal papers of most of the Presidents from George Washington through Calvin Coolidge. The music collections contain volumes and pieces (manuscript and published) from classic works to the newest popular compositions. Other materials available for research include maps and views; photographic records from the daguerreotype to the latest news photo; recordings, including folksongs and other music, speeches, and poetry readings; prints, drawings, and posters; government documents, newspapers, and periodicals from all over the world; and motion pictures, microforms, and audio and video tapes.

If included among the Nation's Fortune 500 firms, it would rank in the top 50. Its $16.5 billion appropriation comprises close to 3 percent of total Federal discretionary spending DOE Funds the largest environmental cleanup in history, and research and development that supports the Nation's defense and its energy and economic security. DOE employs over 11,000 Federal employees and about 108,000 contract employees. DOE owns and manages over 50 major installations located on 2.4 million acres in 35 States and is the fourth largest Federal landowner in the United States. DOE is an energy policy, supply, and technology enterprise. It invests in developing a secure, clean, and sustainable energy system. It helps the Nation meet its environmental challenges by administering the largest pollution prevention and efficiency program in the world, with partners from every sector of the economy. It enhances the Nation's energy security by increasing the diversity of energy, and fuel choices and sources; bringing renewable energy sources into the market, strengthening domestic production of oil and gas, maintaining the U.S. nuclear energy option, and increasing the efficiency with which we use energy and generate electricity. The Department also maintains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and operates five Power Marketing Administrations that sell and distribute over $3 billion of electric power generated at Federal hydroelectric plants. DOE is a national security enterprise. It is a key player in the Administration's furtherance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and its overall goal of reducing the global danger from nuclear weapons. It ensures the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. At the same time, it manages and safely dismantles excess nuclear materials, and ensures the security of vital departmental nuclear assets. It provides policy and technical assistance to curb global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing U.S. nonproliferation, arms control, and nuclear safety objectives in the states of the former Soviet union and worldwide. Further, it develops and ensures the safety and reliability of nuclear reactor plants to power U.S. Navy warships. DOE is an environmental remediation enterprise. It cleans up the 50-year environmental legacy left at the industrial complexes where nuclear weapons were designed and manufactured. It manages the problems associated with the large quantities of various types of radioactive wastes, surplus nuclear materials, and spent nuclear fuels that remain at the sites of the Nation's nuclear weapons facilities and at nuclear energy research and development sites. In addition, it must address the growing inventory of spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactors that is awaiting disposal. These wastes must be dealt with responsibly to ensure the safety and health of the public. DOE is a science and technology enterprise. At the center of all we do are our 27 laboratories, our additional scientific user facilities, and our researchers at the Nation's universities. These form the backbone of U.S. scientific leadership by conducting and facilitating breakthrough research in energy sciences and technology, high energy physics, global climate change, genomics, superconducting materials, accelerator technologies, environmental sciences, and super-computing in support of DOE's mission. The laboratories, described as the crown jewels of the Nation's science establishment, and the Department's funding of research at universities have resulted in 66 Nobel prize winners, including three in 1996. The Department is also an investor in the Nation's most precious resource - its youth - by supporting science and mathematics education in our schools through grants, educational programs, and fellowships. DOE is global enterprise. The outcome of our work is the technology that stimulates the private market for the expansion of clean energy to meet national and global energy requirements of almost 500 quadrillion Btu's by the year 2010 - a staggering 36 percent increase over 1995. Overseas energy market needs include coal, nuclear power, oil and gas exploration, energy efficiency, and renewable energy technologies that are available for export now or that will soon be available for the international marketplace. DOE supports the export of U.S. energy services and technologies by assisting the nations in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, an Africa, and the states of the former Soviet Union in developing private markets for environmentally responsible, sustainable energy. These alliances support U.S. competitiveness in a global economy of growing energy infrastructure requirements and create jobs in the U.S. at all skill levels.", "shortName": "DOE", "sourceCfdaPk": "f9b483c381bd2a656b43cec368f9438f", "summary": "DOE is major government enterprise.

DOE employs over 11,000 Federal employees and about 108,000 contract employees. DOE owns and manages over 50 major installations located on 2.4 million acres in 35 States and is the fourth largest Federal landowner in the United States. DOE is an energy policy, supply, and technology enterprise. It invests in developing a secure, clean, and sustainable energy system. It helps the Nation meet its environmental challenges by administering the largest pollution prevention and efficiency program in the world, with partners from every sector of the economy. It enhances the Nation's energy security by increasing the diversity of energy, and fuel choices and sources; bringing renewable energy sources into the market, strengthening domestic production of oil and gas, maintaining the U.S. nuclear energy option, and increasing the efficiency with which we use energy and generate electricity. The Department also maintains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and operates five Power Marketing Administrations that sell and distribute over $3 billion of electric power generated at Federal hydroelectric plants. DOE is a national security enterprise. It is a key player in the Administration's furtherance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and its overall goal of reducing the global danger from nuclear weapons. It ensures the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. At the same time, it manages and safely dismantles excess nuclear materials, and ensures the security of vital departmental nuclear assets. It provides policy and technical assistance to curb global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing U.S. nonproliferation, arms control, and nuclear safety objectives in the states of the former Soviet union and worldwide. Further, it develops and ensures the safety and reliability of nuclear reactor plants to power U.S. Navy warships. DOE is an environmental remediation enterprise. It cleans up the 50-year environmental legacy left at the industrial complexes where nuclear weapons were designed and manufactured. It manages the problems associated with the large quantities of various types of radioactive wastes, surplus nuclear materials, and spent nuclear fuels that remain at the sites of the Nation's nuclear weapons facilities and at nuclear energy research and development sites. In addition, it must address the growing inventory of spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactors that is awaiting disposal. These wastes must be dealt with responsibly to ensure the safety and health of the public. DOE is a science and technology enterprise. At the center of all we do are our 27 laboratories, our additional scientific user facilities, and our researchers at the Nation's universities. These form the backbone of U.S. scientific leadership by conducting and facilitating breakthrough research in energy sciences and technology, high energy physics, global climate change, genomics, superconducting materials, accelerator technologies, environmental sciences, and super-computing in support of DOE's mission. The laboratories, described as the crown jewels of the Nation's science establishment, and the Department's funding of research at universities have resulted in 66 Nobel prize winners, including three in 1996. The Department is also an investor in the Nation's most precious resource - its youth - by supporting science and mathematics education in our schools through grants, educational programs, and fellowships. DOE is global enterprise. The outcome of our work is the technology that stimulates the private market for the expansion of clean energy to meet national and global energy requirements of almost 500 quadrillion Btu's by the year 2010 - a staggering 36 percent increase over 1995. Overseas energy market needs include coal, nuclear power, oil and gas exploration, energy efficiency, and renewable energy technologies that are available for export now or that will soon be available for the international marketplace. DOE supports the export of U.S. energy services and technologies by assisting the nations in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, an Africa, and the states of the former Soviet Union in developing private markets for environmentally responsible, sustainable energy. These alliances support U.S. competitiveness in a global economy of growing energy infrastructure requirements and create jobs in the U.S. at all skill levels.", "code": "089", "categoryDesc": "DEPARTMENT", "orgCode": "ORG-1056", "hierarchy": [], "orgAddresses": [{"address_key": 100272460, "org_key": 100011980, "street_address": "2345 Stevens Drive", "street_address_2": null, "city": "Richland", "state": "WA", "zipcode": "", "country_code": "US", "created_by": "bb863595cd3aee02b74b10d5ca46fe94", "created_date": "2008-04-22T13:52:24", "last_modified_by": "aa7462643ffde67be1d13d3ef62be317", "last_modified_date": "2009-03-04T10:34:02", "mod_status": "active", "is_source_fpds": null, "is_source_cfda": true, "is_source_fh_app": null, "type": "M"}], "orgLegacyList": [{"org_key": 100011980, "legacy_id": "f9b483c381bd2a656b43cec368f9438f", "legacy_name": "ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF", "created_by": "FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING", "created_date": "2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808", "last_modified_by": "FH_FBO_DEPT_AGENCY_MAPPING", "last_modified_date": "2019-10-16T19:52:25.28808", "legacy_system_name": "FBO", "legacy_key": 4524, "source": null}, {"org_key": 100011980, "legacy_id": "f9b483c381bd2a656b43cec368f9438f", "legacy_name": "ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF", "created_by": "IAE-DATATeam", "created_date": "2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308", "last_modified_by": "IAE_DATETeam", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-17T19:16:15.284308", "legacy_system_name": "CFDA", "legacy_key": 1481, "source": null}], "l1OrgKey": 100011980, "l1Name": "ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF", "links": [], "isSourceCfda": true, "isSourceCwCfda": true, "isSourceFpds": true},{"orgKey": 100114097, "name": "NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE", "type": "AGENCY", "parentOrgKey": 100006809, "fullParentPath": "100006809.100114097", "createdDate": "2010-03-22T04:00:00.000+00:00", "lastModifiedBy": "FPDS_CIV_AGENCY_START_DATE_FIX", "lastModifiedDate": "2019-09-14T23:19:48.722+00:00", "fullParentPathName": "AGRICULTURE, DEPARTMENT OF.NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE", "startDate": "2003-06-07T04:00:00.000+00:00", "agencyName": "National Agricultural Statistics Service", "fpdsCode": "12H5", "cfdaCode": "10", "a11TacCode": "15", "modStatus": "ACTIVE", "cgac": "012", "level": 2, "fpdsOrgId": "12H5", "l1ShortName": "USDA", "ombBureauCode": " 15", "cfdaBur": 15, "cfdaOmb": 5, "description": "Agricultural estimates involve collecting, analyzing, and publishing agricultural production and marketing data, including:  number of farms and acreage in farms; crop acreage, yields, production, stocks, value, and utilization; inventories and production of livestock, poultry, eggs, and dairy products; prices received by farmers for products, prices paid for commodities and services for living and production, and related indexes; farm employment and wage rates; cold storage supplies; agricultural chemical use; aquaculture; and other relevant aspects of the agricultural economy.

It was established to strengthen the Nation's capacity to promote international peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among the peoples and nations of the world. The purpose of the Institute is to develop and disseminate knowledge about the peaceful resolution of international conflict.  To accomplish this the Institute has set the following goals:  To provide creative practical insights through research, education, and training on negotiation, mediation, and other skills to those actively engaged in resolving international conflicts; to expand the body of knowledge about the nature and processes of peace, war, and international conflict management; and to disseminate information to the public about these subjects.  Among the Institute's instruments are grants, fellowships, a library, and in-house projects. The grants program provides financial support to nonprofit organizations, including private colleges and universities; official public institutions, including public schools, colleges, universities, libraries, and Federal, State, and local agencies; and individuals, whether or not they are associated with nonprofit or official public institutions. The Jennings Randolph Program for International Peace offers senior fellowships annually to practitioners or scholars in the U.S. and around the world who join the Institute for about ten months to work on projects concerning the sources and nature of international conflict and ways of managing conflict and sustaining peace.  The program also awards Peace Scholar Dissertation Fellowships annually to outstanding doctoral students enrolled in an accredited university in the U.S. who are researching or writing a dissertation that promises to contribute knowledge relevant to the formulation of policy on international peace and conflict issues.  The Jeannette Rankin Library Program is developing four main components on international peacemaking:  a specialized research library; a network with and support for other libraries, both specialized and public; an oral history resource; and bibliographic as well as other data bases. Institute-directed projects under the Education and Public Information Program include an educational TV program and cassette programs on such topics as U.S.-Soviet summitry and a National Peace Essay Contest for high school students.  The in-house Research and Studies is completing a broad, systematic examination of peace and conflict management theories and features workshops and seminars.

Multi-employer Insurance: Under Title IV of the Act, as originally enacted, the Corporation guaranteed nonforfeitable benefits for multi-employer plans in a similar fashion as for single-employer plans.
