CFR AND ASSOCIATED FRUIT QUALITY ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED AS THE HIGHEST RESEARCH PRIORITY BY CRANBERRY GROWERS ACROSS ALL THE GROWING REGIONS. MANAGING CFR IS CHALLENGING; &GT;15 FUNGAL SPECIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CFR AND THERE ARE NO MODERN DISEASE RISK MODELS. SOME OF THE NEWER HIGH-YIELDING CULTIVARS ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO CFR. ONLY A FEW CLASSES OF FUNGICIDES ARE REGISTERED FOR CRANBERRY, THUS RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT IS COMPLEX. THE CURRENT SOLUTIONS FOR CRANBERRY FRUIT ROT ARE CENTERED ON PREVENTING INFECTIONS DURING THE BLOOM PERIOD, AND WHILE FUNGICIDES SPRAYS ARE SHOWN TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF FRUIT ROT, IN YEARS WITH HEAT STRESS OR INCREASED PRECIPITATION DURING BERRY DEVELOPMENT, FRUIT ROT EMERGES AS A MAJOR ISSUE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE TAKE A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE CFR. WE WILL VET MOLECULAR METHODS TO IDENTIFY PATHOGENS AND MONITOR PATHOGEN SENSITIVITY TO FUNGICIDES REGIONALLY AND AT THE FARM LEVEL (OBJ. 1).

THE FINANCIAL LOSSES INCURRED DUE TO HLB HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE SEVERAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE US ALONE. CITRUS IS AN IMPORTANT FOOD CROP AND CONSUMED WIDELY IN THE USA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. THE FRUITS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE NUTRIENT-DENSE AND ARE RICH IN BENEFICIAL PHYTOCHEMICALS LIKE FLAVONOIDS, CAROTENOIDS, COUMARINS, TERPENES, AND LIMONOIDS. THE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CITRUS FRUITS PROTECT AGAINST SEVERAL CHRONIC DISEASES. CITRUS IS ALSO AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE DIET FOR MOST PEOPLE. JUICE DERIVED FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF CITRUS IS CONSUMED WIDELY. CULTIVATING CITRUS PROVIDES REVENUE THAT SUPPORTS MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES IN THE USA.THE DEVASTATION CAUSED BY HLB HAS NOW THREATENED THE CITRUS INDUSTRY IN FLORIDA. TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA, THE OTHER TWO PROMINENT CITRUS-PRODUCING STATES, ARE LIKELY TO BE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION IF THE DISEASE IS NOT CONTROLLED. DESPITE RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON HLB FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS, TANGIBLE, PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THE GROWERS. HLB IS APTLY DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST THREAT TO CITRUS CULTIVATION IN THE USA. THE DISEASE COMPLEX IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF THE UNCULTIVABLE NATURE OF THE PATHOGEN (LEADING TO LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE ORGANISM), LATE SYMPTOM EXPRESSION (RESULTING IN THE SPREAD OF THE PATHOGEN BEFORE AN INFECTED PLANT CAN BE IDENTIFIED), AND, UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE PATHOGEN IN THE HOST PLANTS (RESULTING IN SAMPLING ISSUES AND FALSE NEGATIVES IN HLB SURVEYS). IN ADDITION, THE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF THE RAPIDLY PROLIFERATING PSYLLID VECTOR AND DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROLLING OF PSYLLID POPULATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHALLENGES RELATED TO DEVELOPING PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS. SHORT-TERM DISEASE MANAGEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY CONTROLLING PSYLLIDS, PREVENTING SPREAD BY ADHERING TO PHYTOSANITARY PRACTICES, AND IMPLEMENTING STRICT REGULATIONS. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS WILL BE NEEDED TO CONTINUE CITRUS CULTIVATION IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HLB ASSOCIATED PATHOGEN AND THE PSYLLID VECTOR. HLB HAS NOW ESTABLISHED IN THE THREE MAJOR CITRUS GROWING STATES OF THE USA. HLB DISEASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT ARE IN VOGUE ARE USEFUL FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY; LONG-TERM CONTROL OF HLB WILL REQUIRE GENETIC SOLUTIONS. THE MOST PROMISING SOLUTION IS TO DEVELOP DISEASE-RESISTANT CULTIVARS THAT PREVENT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ASSOCIATED PATHOGEN. SINCE THERE IS NO APPRECIABLE HLB RESISTANCE IN THE GENUS CITRUS, UTILIZING GENETIC RESOURCES OF WILD RELATIVES IS A VIABLE OPTION TO INTROGRESS RESISTANCE TRAITS INTO CULTIVATED CITRUS. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY CHARACTERIZED HLB SENSITIVITY ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PHYLOGENETICALLY DIVERSE CITRUS AND RELATIVE GENERA UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS. WE HAVE REPORTED THAT AUSTRALIAN LIMES IN THE GROUPS MICROCITRUS AND EREMOCITRUS, THAT DIVERGED FROM THE MANDARIN LINEAGE APPROXIMATELY 6 MILLION YEARS AGO, HAVE HLB RESISTANCE TRAIT THAT IS SUPERIOR TO CITRUS. BUILDING ON THIS INSIGHT, WE CREATED CITRUS X MICROCITRUS HYBRIDS THAT POSSESS BOTH GOOD FRUIT QUALITY AND STRONG HLB RESISTANCE; THESE MATERIALS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF NEW HLB SOLUTIONS THAT WE EXPLOIT HERE TODEVELOP COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE, NON-TRANSGENIC, HLB-RESISTANT CULTIVARS.OUR PROJECT BUILDS ON PREVIOUS WORK WHERE WE IDENTIFIED NATURAL SOURCES OF HLB RESISTANCE, BRED FOR NEW HLB RESISTANT VARIETIES, AND DEVELOPED THE GENOMIC RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR MARKER-ASSISTED SELECTION OF HLB RESISTANCE. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THESE BY CONDUCTING MULTI-SITE EVALUATIONS OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF HYBRIDS IN FLORIDA, TEXAS, AND CALIFORNIA. OUR PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED PIPELINE THAT WILL ACCELERATE THE FARM-LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR RESEARCH AND HASTEN THE TIME-LINES FOR TRANSITIONING THESE MATERIALS FROM THE LAB TO THE GROWER. OUR PIPELINE WILL ENABLE THE RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF VALUABLE HYBRIDS BY COMBINING MULTIPLE STRATEGIES INCLUDING THE USE OF PRECOCIOUS FRUITING TO ACCELERATE FRUIT EVALUATION, METABOLOMICS AND GENOMICS TO QUICKLY ELIMINATE UNDESIRABLE HYBRIDS, AND MULTI- LOCATION FIELD TRIALS TO ASSESS HLB RESISTANCE, HORTICULTURAL PERFORMANCE, AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE IN REAL-WORLD CONTEXTS. OUR APPROACH IS TO INCORPORATE RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED GENOMIC SEGMENTS FROM AUSTRALIAN LIMES TO CULTIVATED CITRUS TYPES. THE PROCESS OF SELECTING PROMISING HYBRIDS FROM BREEDING POPULATIONS IS GENERALLY TIME CONSUMING AND INVOLVES GREENHOUSE EVALUATIONS, PRELIMINARY HORTICULTURAL DATA, FIELD PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS OF SINGLE TREES AND FINALLY, BY MULTI-LOCATION FIELD TRIALS.

WE PROPOSE A NON-GMO SOLUTION BASED ON OUR RECENT DISCOVERY OF A NOVEL INFECTIOUS AGENT: A VIRUS-LIKE RNA KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT MOBILE RNA (\"IRNA\"), WHICH WAS THE AGENT ORIGINALLY DESCRIBED IN LIMEQUAT TREES IN CA IN THE 1950&#39;S. THE IRNA IS 100% GRAFT TRANSMISSIBLE, VIRTUALLY SYMPTOMLESS ON NEARALY ALL CITRUS, ACCUMULATES TO EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS IN THE PHLOEM, AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ENGINEERED AS A VIGS (VIRUS-INDUCED GENE SILENCING) VECTOR.

CITRUS PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES IS WORTH $3 BILLION AND IN FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA PROVIDES NEARLY 100,000 JOBS. HOWEVER, THE FUTURE OF THE CITRUS INDUSTRY PRODUCING ORANGE JUICE AND FRESH FRUIT IS THREATENED WORLDWIDE BY A DEVASTATING DISEASE KNOWN AS HUANGLONGBING (HLB FOR SHORT). IT IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS \"CITRUS GREENING.\"THE DISEASE ORIGINATED IN CHINA AND HAS SPREAD RAPIDLY ACROSS THE GLOBE, LEADING TO THE LOSS OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION CITRUS TREES. THE DISEASE IS DIFFICULT TO STOP BECAUSE THE CAUSAL BACTERIUM LIVES IN THE TREE&#39;S PHLOEM, WHICH IS A PART OF THE PLANT&#39;S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM LYING JUST BENEATH THE BARK, THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REACH.THE DISEASE IS CARRIED BY A FLYING INSECT CALLED A PSYLLID, WHICH IS SMALLER THAN A SESAME SEED. THE PSYLLID BECOMES A TRANSMITTER OF THE DISEASE BY FIRST FEEDING ON THE LEAVES OF AN INFECTED TREE, INGESTING HLB BACTERIUM. ONCE THE BACTERIUM IS IN THE PSYLLID, THE PSYLLID CONVEYS THE DISEASE TO OTHER TREES IT FEEDS UPON. IN THIS WAY, THE DISEASE IS TRANSMITTED FROM TREE TO TREE.SUPPRESSION OF THE PSYLLID WAS TRIED IN FLORIDA BUT FAILED. IT IS NOW ASSUMED THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY TREE OF FRUIT-BEARING AGE IN FLORIDA IS INFECTED.HLB AFFECTS CITRUS TREES FROM THE ROOTS UP, CLOGGING THE TREE&#39;S VASCULAR SYSTEM AND DISRUPTING CARBOHYDRATE PRODUCTION IN THE LEAVES AND NUTRIENT AND WATER FLOW THROUGHOUT THE TREE. WHAT RESULTS IS DEBILITATION OF THE TREE WITH FEWER LEAVES AND SMALL, MISSHAPEN FRUIT THAT DEVELOPS A BITTER TASTE. INFECTED TREES DECLINE IN PRODUCTION A FEW YEARS AFTER INFECTION.OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES ON THIS PROBLEM. WHILE WE NOW KNOW MORE ABOUT THE DISEASE THAN EVER, AND WHILE ENHANCED NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS AND OTHER HORTICULTURAL PRACTICES HAVE IMPROVED YIELD AND FRUIT QUALITY, NOT A SINGLE COST-EFFECTIVE THERAPY HAS RESULTED FROM THESE EFFORTS. WHY IS THIS? THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS, BUT ONE OF THE MAJOR ONES IS THAT THIS BACTERIUM CAN ONLY PROPAGATE IN THE CITRUS TREE&#39;S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OR PSYLLID&#39;S GUT, MAKING TRADITIONAL SCREENING AND DISCOVERY IN THE LABORATORY DIFFICULT. DETECTING THE DISEASE IN CITRUS TREES IS ALSO TRICKY BECAUSE SIGNS OF THE DISEASE ARE NOT MANIFESTED QUICKLY; IT CAN TAKE YEARS FOR AN INFECTED TREE TO SHOW VISUAL SYMPTOMS. AND SINCE NEARLY ALL MATURE TREES IN FLORIDA AND MANY IN TEXAS ARE INFECTED, THERE IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF INOCULUM BEING SPREAD BY THE INSECT CARRIERS. IN CALIFORNIA, MORE THAN 1,500 TREES IN RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE INFECTED, CAUSING THEM TO BE REMOVED TO KEEP THE DISEASE OUT OF COMMERCIALLY PRODUCING GROVES.TO ADDRESSA PROBLEM OF THIS COMPLEXITY AND MAGNITUDE, A CONCERTED EFFORT IS NEEDED WHICH COMBINES THE EXPERTISE ACROSS SEVERAL ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES, THE AGROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY AND CITRUS INDUSTRY EXPERTS. NEW APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PRODUCTS, QUICKLY DETECT THE DISEASE, AND TEST TREES FOR THE ABILITY TO SUPPRESS OR KILL HLB. TWO APPROACHES ARE BEING INVESTIGATED IN PARALLEL TO SPEED DEVELOPMENT.IN ONE CASE, THE AGROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY PARTNER IS LOOKING FOR NATURALLY OCCURRING MICROBES THAT COULD FIGHT THE DISEASE. MICROBES PROTECT BOTH HUMANS AND PLANTS AGAINST MANY DISEASES AND ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR HEALTH. IN FACT, MANY OF OUR IMPORTANT HUMAN THERAPIES, LIKE ERYTHROMYCIN AND PENICILLIN, ARE PRODUCED BY MICROORGANISMS. A LIBRARY OF MORE THAN 100,000 ISOLATED MICROBIAL STRAINS IS BEING SEARCHED FOR ONE THAT COULD NATURALLY CONTROL CITRUS GREENING.IN A SECOND APPROACH, MORE THAN 200,000 SYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS ARE BEING SCREENED TO DETERMINE IF THEY CAN BOOST THE PLANT&#39;S DEFENSE SYSTEM. THINK OF IT AS DEVELOPING A VACCINE FOR PLANTS. COMBINING DIFFERENT WAYS TO STOP CITRUS GREENING CAN HELP KEEP HLB FROM DEVELOPING IMMUNITY TO THE THERAPIES.AFTER LABORATORY TESTING ON MODEL ORGANISMS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO BEGIN TESTING ON PLANT SYSTEMS. AT TEXAS A&AMP;M, A RESEARCHER HAS DEVELOPED A WAY TO USE ROOT TISSUE FROM INFECTED PLANTS RAISED IN THE GREENHOUSE TO PROVIDE A RAPID METHOD FOR SCREENING MICROBES AND CHEMICALS FOR THEIR POTENTIAL IN KILLING HLB. THE ONES FOUND TO BE ACTIVE ARE THEN SENT TO A RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA WHERE A GREENHOUSE CITRUS ASSAY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR TESTING THERAPIES FOR CONTROL OF HLB. WHILE THIS TEST TAKES SEVERAL MONTHS, IT PROVIDES VALUABLE INFORMATION ON HOW THERAPIES CAN BE APPLIED TO CITRUS TO REACH THE PATHOGEN AND HOW OFTEN TREATMENT IS NEEDED. FINALLY, THE BEST PERFORMING MICROBES AND COMPOUNDS ARE TESTED IN FIELD TRIALS IN FLORIDA. SINCE THE DISEASE IS EVERYWHERE THERE, IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE TREES WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME INFECTED, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE IF THE MICROBES AND COMPOUNDS ARE EFFECTIVE. TO TRACK THE ACTIVITY OF THE THERAPIES, TESTING IS CARRIED OUT ON CITRUS TRANSPLANTS COMING FROM NURSERIES WITHOUT DISEASE. AS THEY ARE EXPOSED TO THE POPULATION OF PSYLLIDS CARRYING THE BACTERIUM, THE PROGRESS OF DISEASE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE MONITORED TO SEE HOW THE THERAPIES ARE PERFORMING.TRADITIONAL METHODS FOR FOLLOWING DISEASE ARE CHALLENGING BECAUSE THE BACTERIUM IS NOT EVENLY SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE TREE ITSELF, AND BACTERIAL DISTRIBUTION VARIES WITH THE TIME OF THE YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CERTAIN SEASONS, THE BACTERIUM MAY MOVE INTO THE ROOTS SO SAMPLING LEAVES FOR THE DISEASE WILL GIVE A NEGATIVE RESULT EVEN IF THE TREE IS INFECTED. TO ADDRESS THIS, A RESEARCHER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS HAS DEVELOPED A WAY TO LOOK AT THE TREE&#39;S RESPONSE TO THE INFECTION, LIKE MONITORING THE LEVEL OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS IN AN INFECTED HUMAN. HERE, INFECTED CITRUS TREES PRODUCE AN IMMUNE RESPONSE THAT CAN BE SEEN IN ANY TISSUE OF THE TREE, SO SAMPLING IS NOT A PROBLEM. ALSO, THIS RESPONSE OCCURS VERY QUICKLY AFTER INFECTION EVEN WHILE THE TREES DO NOT SHOW ANY DISEASE SYMPTOMS. THIS METHOD IS BEING COMPARED TO THE MORE TRADITIONAL DISEASE DETECTION METHOD TO SEE IF BACTERIAL INFECTION IS DETECTED SOONER AND MORE ACCURATELY.IN THE END, IT IS HOPED THAT BY COMBINING THE SCREENING CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE OF THE AGROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY PARTNER WITH THE EXPERTISE FOUND IN TOP AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING GOOD COMMUNICATION WITH THE CITRUS INDUSTRY, WE WILL MAKE PROGRESS IN IDENTIFYING TREATMENTS THAT WILL SLOW DOWN OR HALT THIS DISEASE. THE RESULT WILL BE HEALTHIER TREES WITH MORE PRODUCTION TO SUSTAIN US CITRUS PRODUCTION, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING THE JOBS ASSOCIATED WITH A VIBRANT CITRUS INDUSTRY.WE ARE DETERMINED TO SUCCEED BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT CITRUS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4473f2d2-4072-809f-b5ad-3637049dc096-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20207002933196_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 111064360, "Award ID": "20207002933195", "Award Amount": 1473890.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-16", "CFDA Number": "10.309", "Description": "HUANGLONGBING (HLB)-RESISTANT OR TOLERANT CITRUS TREES ARE THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION FOR THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE.

CALIFORNIA (CA) IS THE NATION&#39;S LEADING PRODUCER GENERATING REVENUE IN EXCESS OF $412M, FOLLOWED BY FLORIDA (FL, $100M), WHERE IT IS THE SECOND MAJOR FRUIT CROP AFTER CITRUS, AND HAWAII (HI). AVOCADO GROWERS FACE NUMEROUS PRODUCTION CHALLENGES INCLUDING DEVASTATING DISEASES SUCH AS PHYTOPHTHORA ROOT ROT (PRR), CAUSED BY PHYTOPHTHORA CINNAMOMI (PC), LAUREL WILT (LW), AND SALINITY WHICH IN COMBINATION CAUSE SEVERE REDUCTION IN FRUIT YIELD, QUALITY, AND CAN DESTROY COMPLETE AVOCADO ORCHARDS IF NOT MANAGED PROPERLY.

SATIVUS) ARE ONE OF THE UNITED STATES&#39; LEADING ROOT CROPS. THE 2018 FARM-GATE VALUE OF CARROTS IN THE U.S. WAS $731,504,000 AND AVERAGE PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION OF FRESH CARROTS IN THE U.S. IS 12.4 LB. PER PERSON. CARROT SEED PRODUCTION IS LIMITED TO ONLY A FEW REGIONS OF THE WORLD WHERE SUITABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS EXIST FOR HYBRID SEED PRODUCTION OF THIS BIENNIAL SPECIES. IN FACT, OVER 50% OF THE WORLD&#39;S HYBRID CARROT SEED IS PRODUCED IN CENTRAL OREGON, CENTRAL WASHINGTON, SOUTHERN IDAHO, AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OF THE U.S. PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION. STAKEHOLDERS HAVE CONSISTENTLY IDENTIFIED BACTERIAL BLIGHT CAUSED BY XANTHOMONAS HORTORUM PV. CAROTAE (XHC) AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF US CARROT SEED PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, BECAUSE XHC IS SEED-BORNE, IT IS NOT ONLY A MAJOR CONCERN FOR THE HYBRID CARROT SEED INDUSTRY IN THE U.S. BUT ALSO TO REGIONS THAT IMPORT CARROT SEED FOR FRESH OR PROCESSED CARROT PRODUCTION. XHC CAN SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE EPIPHYTICALLY ON THE LEAVES, FLOWERS, AND STEMS OF HOST AND NON-HOST PLANTS WITHOUT CAUSING DISEASE SYMPTOMS. WHEN WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE SUFFICIENTLY WARM AND HUMID, XHC CAN INCITE DISEASE, WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEFOLIATION AND SIGNIFICANT YIELD LOSSES. IN THE CASE OF BACTERIAL BLIGHT, SYMPTOMS ARE OFTEN NOT OBSERVED ON CARROTS UNTIL A RELATIVELY HIGH POPULATION IS ATTAINED (&GT; 104 XHC/G LEAF TISSUE). ONE REASON WHY XHC IS SO PROBLEMATIC IN CARROT AND CARROT SEED PRODUCTION IS THAT THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE PATHOGEN INFECTS PLANTS AND INFESTS SEEDS IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. CRITICAL NEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH BACTERIAL BLIGHT IN CARROT AND CARROT SEED INCLUDE: I) IMPROVING DISEASE CONTROL IN THE FIELD AND POST-HARVEST; II) LEARNING HOW XHC SPREADS IN SEED PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; III) DETERMINING IF CARROT SEED BECOMES INFESTED EXTERNALLY, INFECTED INTERNALLY, OR BOTH; IV) IDENTIFYING SOURCES OF XHC IN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND QUANTIFYING THE EXTENT OF INOCULUM DISSEMINATION VIA PROPAGATIVE MATERIALS; AND V) QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF BACTERIAL BLIGHT ON YIELD AND/OR QUALITY OF CARROT SEED, AS WELL AS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MITIGATION OF THESE EFFECTS.WE PROPOSE TO USE A TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH APPROACH, DEEPLY INTEGRATED WITH EXTENSION AND OUTREACH, TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL NEEDS. FOR OBJECTIVE 1, WE WILL EVALUATE AND IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABLE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) APPROACHES FOR BACTERIAL BLIGHT IN CARROT AND CARROT SEED CROPS. TO IMPROVE XHC IPM IN THE FIELD WE WILL IDENTIFY CULTURAL PRACTICES THAT REDUCE XHC SURVIVAL AND SOURCES OF INOCULUM, SCREEN NATURAL COMPOUNDS AND BIORATIONAL PRODUCTS FOR THE BIOCONTROL OF XHC, AND ASSESS A MULTI-PRONGED IPM APPROACH. WE WILL ALSO TEST COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES THAT CAN BE USED WITH EXISTING POST-HARVEST SEED DISINFESTATION PRACTICES. IN OBJECTIVE 2, WE WILL IDENTIFY AND MODEL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES RELATED TO XHC AEROBIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY. TO UNDERSTAND XHC AND GENERAL BACTERIAL AEROBIOLOGY AT MULTIPLE SCALES, WE WILL DETERMINE THE PARTICLE SIZES, AGRICULTURE EVENTS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH XHC AERIAL DISPERSION AND DEVELOP OR ADAPT TRANSPORT MODELS THAT ACCURATELY DESCRIBE PATHOGEN DISPERSION BETWEEN AND WITHIN FIELDS. THE GOAL OF OBJECTIVE 3 IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF XHC COLONIZATION IN CARROTS TO INFORM AND ENABLE MORE PRECISE AND EFFECTIVE CONTROL MEASURES. WE WILL USE VARIOUS MICROSCOPY METHODS (LIGHT, LASER CONFOCAL FLUORESCENCE, AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY) TO TRACE THE XHC INFECTION PROCESS AND GAIN INSIGHTS INTO WHERE THE PATHOGEN COLONIZES PLANTS, WHEN AND WHERE XHC INITIATES INFECTION, AND HOW THE PATHOGEN INFESTS SEEDS. WE WILL USE POPULATION GENOMICS APPROACHES IN OBJECTIVE 4 TO IDENTIFY SOURCES OF BACTERIAL BLIGHT INOCULUM AND DISPERSAL POTENTIAL OF XHC IN CARROT AND CARROT SEED PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. THE GENOMIC DIVERSITY OF XHC FROM U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CARROT AND CARROT SEED PRODUCTION AREAS, WILD CARROT POPULATIONS, PROPAGATIVE MATERIALS, ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES, AND HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS WILL BE DETERMINED AND THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO MODEL TRANSMISSION CHAINS AND INOCULUM SOURCES.

THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WILL FOSTER CHANGES IN PRACTICES, INCREASE THE NUMBER AND EFFICACY OF BACTERIAL BLIGHT CONTROL METHODS, AND INTRODUCE POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE USED AT DIFFERENT STAGES IN THE PROCESS OF CARROT SEED AND ROOT PRODUCTION. THE EXPECTED DELIVERABLES RESULTING FROM THIS PROJECT INCLUDE: I) ENHANCED IPM APPROACHES FOR BACTERIAL BLIGHT CONTROL INTHE FIELD AND POST-HARVEST; II) PARTICLE TRANSPORT MODELS THAT EXPLAIN FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH XHC DISPERSAL; III) AN UNDERSTANDING OF PLANT AND SEED INFECTION PROCESSES TO INFORM FUTURE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; IV) IDENTIFICATION OF SOURCES AND TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS OF XHC IN CARROT PRODUCTION SYSTEMS FOR TARGETED MITIGATION EFFORTS; AND V) AN ECONOMIC ANALYSES OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH BACTERIAL BLIGHT AND RELATED IPM EFFORTS TO GUIDE FUTURE STAKEHOLDER DECISIONS. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A SUITE OF IPM APPROACHES FOR THE CARROT INDUSTRY TO REDUCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BACTERIAL BLIGHT CAUSED BY XHC. AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TOWARDS MITIGATING XHC WILL REDUCE INDUSTRY RELIANCE ON HOT WATER TREATMENT OF SEED LOTS, WHICH IS EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO PERFORM AT LARGE SCALES, REDUCE ECONOMIC LOSSES BY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF SEED LOTS REJECTED AT PORTS OF ENTRY, AND INCREASE AGRICULTURAL INCOME AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES IN RURAL AREAS IN WHICH CARROT AND CARROT SEEDSARE PRODUCED. IN CARROT AND CARROT SEED PRODUCTION, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT AN IPM APPROACH WILL DECREASE COPPER USE THUS REDUCING THE INDIRECT IMPACTS TO SOIL AND THE WATER TABLE AND DIRECT IMPACTS TO BEES, NATIVE POLLINATORS, AND OTHER BENEFICIAL MICROORGANISMS THAT PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF CROP PLANTS.

IN ADDITION TO VIRUSES THAT SYSTEMICALLY INFECT SWEETPOTATO PLANTING MATERIAL, TWO MAJOR DISEASE PROBLEMS HAVE EMERGED ON STORAGE ROOTS, IN PART BECAUSE THEY CAN BE TRANSFERRED ON SEED ROOTS: BLACK ROT AND GRKN. ONGOING RESEARCH ON BLACK ROT IN NC AND LA FOCUSES ON FINDING RESISTANCE TO THE DISEASE AND FUNGICIDAL CONTROLS. ONE GOAL IS TO FIND RESISTANCE THAT REDUCES TRANSMISSION FROM INFECTED SEED ROOTS TO SPROUTS, THEREBY INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES TO HARVEST CLEAN PLANTS FROM BEDS. ONGOING RESEARCH ON GRKN ALSO FOCUSES ON RESISTANCE, BUT ANOTHER PROJECT AT THE USDA VEGETABLE LAB IN CHARLESTON, SC IS AIMED AT FINDING METHODS TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF GRKN IN STORAGE ROOTS WHICH MIGHT BE USED BY STATE CROP IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS AS PART OF THE SEED CERTIFICATION PROCESS.EPIGENETIC EFFECTS. EACH CLEAN PLANT CENTER MAY HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MAINTAINING CLEAN PLANT MATERIALS BETWEEN SEASONS EITHER AS \"MOTHER PLANTS\" IN A GREENHOUSE ENVIRONMENT ORAS TISSUE CULTURE IN THE LAB. THE QUESTION WAS RAISED AS TO WHETHER THESE METHODS HAD ANY EPIGENETIC EFFECTS THAT MIGHT ALTER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PLANTS. A PROJECT WAS INITIATED IN LA TO INVESTIGATE THAT POSSIBILITY, USING MURASAKI AND COVINGTON VARIETIES COMPARING GREENHOUSE VS. TISSUE CULTURE MAINTENANCE IN OPTIMAL AND STRESSFUL TISSUE CULTURE CONDITIONS. THESE RESEARCH EFFORTS NEED TO BE EXPANDED.PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT. MOST EXTENSION PUBLICATIONS RECOMMEND USE OF &#39;HIGH-QUALITY PLANTING MATERIALS&#39;, BUT SELDOM HAS THAT BEEN DEFINED FOR COMMERCIAL SWEETPOTATO PRODUCTION. RESEARCH IN LA AND AUSTRALIA INDICATED THAT SEED ROOT SIZE AND SPACING IN PLANT BEDS WILL AFFECT SLIP PRODUCTION. IN ADDITION, SLIP LENGTH AND NUMBER OF NODES, SUCROSE, AND INORGANIC PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY CAN AFFECT STORAGE ROOT YIELD IN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, RECOMMENDATIONS FOR &#39;HIGH-QUALITY&#39; PLANT PRODUCTION ARE STILL LACKING. IF A TREND TO HORIZONTAL SLIP TRANSPLANTING PERSISTS, IT WILL CHANGE REQUIREMENTS FOR SLIPS TO LONGER BUT POTENTIALLY FEWER SLIPS PER ACRE. ALSO, ROW COVERS HAVE BEEN USED TO MAINTAIN EARLY-SEASON WARMTH AND EXCLUDE VIRUS VECTORS, BUT ONLY CASUAL OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE ON SLIP QUALITY.ECONOMICS. AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT STUDY CONDUCTED IN CHINA DETERMINED THE USE OF CCFS INCREASED THE RATE OF RETURN BY 202% BASED ON CHANGES IN SWEETPOTATO YIELD. EVEN THOUGH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION YIELD POTENTIAL IS HIGHER WITH THE USE OF CCFS, THE OVERALL NET-PROFIT CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE NATURE OF EXPLICIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPENSE OF CLEAN PLANT MATERIAL. THE PRICE OF GREENHOUSE-GROWN CLEAN PLANT MATERIAL SOLD FROM CLEAN PLANT CENTERS IS DIFFERENT FROM STATE TO STATE. THIS COULD BE DUE TO CAPITAL INVESTMENT, OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PRACTICES, NUMBER OF PLANTS PRODUCED, AND HOW THE PLANT MATERIAL IS PACKAGED (CUT-SLIPS, LARGE POTTED PLANTS, SMALL PLANTS IN FLATS, ETC....). A PRODUCTION BUDGET DEVELOPED FOR A 30-BY-96-FOOT GREENHOUSE STRUCTURE INDICATES THAT THE APPROXIMATE BREAKEVEN POINTS FOR PRODUCING 40,000, 60,000 OR 80,000 SLIPS $0.65, 0.43, AND 0.32/SLIP.

WITHOUT PRACTICES TO ERADICATE THE PATHOGENS OR METHODS TO COUNTERACT REDUCED PRODUCTIVITY, INFECTED SITES ARE UNSUITABLE FOR REPLANTING. THE PATHOGEN IS LONG-LIVED, WITH INOCULUM THAT CAN PERSIST BELOW GROUND FOR MANY YEARS. AS SUCH, LEAVING THE GROUND FALLOW BEFORE REPLANTING WOULD REQUIRE UP TO A DECADE AND HAVE AN UNACCEPTABLE ECONOMIC BURDEN ON PRODUCERS. FURTHERMORE, PLANTING ANOTHER HORTICULTURAL CROP OTHER THAN A PRUNUS SPECIES IS NOT AN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE OPTION, GIVEN THE BROAD HOST RANGE OF ARR (500+ WOODY PLANT SPECIES). WITHOUT SOLUTIONS, THIS LOSS OF PRODUCTION WILL NOT ONLY HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON THE AFFECTED PRODUCERS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES BUT WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION IN THE SUPPLY OF THESE PRODUCTS AND POTENTIALLY INCREASED COSTS FOR CONSUMERS.U.S. STAKEHOLDERS AND INDUSTRIES THAT SPAN THESE CROPS HAVE GIVEN ARR THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHORT AND LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS TO PRESERVING THESE CRITICAL CROPS AND INDUSTRIES. THE MOST SUSTAINABLE AND EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO MITIGATE THE ARR THREAT TO PEACH, CHERRY, AND ALMOND PRODUCTION IN THE U.S. IS TO DEVELOP GENETICALLY DURABLE ARR-RESISTANT ROOTSTOCKS. WHILE LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS ARE REQUIRED, IN THE INTERIM, SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERMED SOLUTIONS ARE NECESSARY, WHICH IS WHY THIS PROJECT ENCOMPASSES BOTH. THIS PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY RESISTANT GERMPLASM, CHARACTERIZE THE MODE OF RESISTANCE AND UNDERSTAND THE GENETIC BASE OF THE RESISTANCE BY LINKING THE GENOME WITH PHENOME THROUGH SYSTEMS-SCALE DATASETS, SUCH AS TRANSCRIPTOMICS, METABOLOMICS, ETC., ALONG WITH SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL METHODS, TO ENABLE GENOMIC SOLUTIONS AND TRANSLATIONAL BREEDING OF NATURAL (LOCAL AND EXOTIC) SOURCES OF ARR RESISTANCE TO DELIVER ARR RESISTANT ROOTSTOCKS IN THE LONGER TERM. THE INDUSTRY WILL PERCEIVE AN IMMEDIATE BENEFIT WITH THE CHANGE IN CULTURAL PRACTICE AND DIRECT UTILIZATION OF NEW SOURCES OF RESISTANCE IN NURSERIES. ABOVE GROUND ROOT COLLAR EXCAVATION CULTURAL PRACTICE (AGRCE), THAT EXTENDS THE LIFESPAN OF ORCHARDS ON ARR INFECTED SITES, AND NURSERY AND PRODUCER EVALUATION OF HORTICULTURAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE RESISTANT MATERIAL, PROVIDE SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM SOLUTIONS, RESPECTIVELY, AS THE WORK ON GENETIC RESISTANCE PROGRESSES. CULTURAL PRACTICES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF ARR TO PRODUCERS BY EXTENDING THE LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY OF PRUNUS ORCHARDS, THEREFORE THIS PROJECT WILL IMPLEMENT AGRCE FOR PEACH AND CHERRY AND EXPLORE THE USE OF SECTORAL CHIMERA ROOTSTOCKS IN ALMOND AS A STRATEGY TO INCREASE TREE LONGEVITY UNTIL ARR RESISTANT COMPATIBLE ROOTSTOCKS ARE DEVELOPED. SOCIO-ECONOMIC RESEARCH WILL DETERMINE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF ARR AND IMPACT OF PROPOSED SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR GROWERS, WHILE OUTREACH AND EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WILL TARGET PEACH, CHERRY, AND ALMOND GROWERS AFFECTED BY ARR AND TREE-FRUIT NURSERIES, AS THE KEY PARTNERS IN DELIVERING GENETIC SOLUTIONS TO PRODUCERS, SO THAT NEW KNOWLEDGE CAN BE QUICKLY DISSEMINATED AND FEEDBACK OBTAINED.

IN THE LONG TERM, THIS SYSTEM CAN BE DESIGNED FOR ADAPTATION TO OTHER DISEASE AND PEST CONTROL APPLICATIONS.OUR PROJECT GOAL IS TO DEVELOP AN AUTOMATED DELIVERY SYSTEM (ADS) THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY DELIVER LIQUID MATERIALS (INCLUDING BACTERICIDAL MATERIALS, MICROBIAL METABOLITES, RNAI, AND OTHER CHEMICALS AND BIOLOGICALS; FOR SIMPLICITY WILL BE REFERRED TO AS \"THERAPEUTICS\") TO CITRUS PHLOEM THROUGH TINY OPENINGS IN THE TRUNK FOR IMPROVING PLANT HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE. THE ADS WILL ALLOW APPLICATION OF THERAPEUTICS AGAINST PLANT VASCULAR PATHOGENS, SPECIFICALLY CLAS, THROUGH TRUNK AND MAJOR LIMBS OF A CITRUS TREE. THE ADS WILL BE DESIGNED, BUILT AND TESTED WITH AN EXPERIENCED TEAM OF CITRUS PATHOLOGISTS, PHYSIOLOGISTS, AND HORTICULTURISTS, AG. ENGINEERS AND ECONOMISTS AND WILL DELIVER THERAPEUTICS DIRECTLY TO THE PLANT VASCULAR SYSTEM BY FACILITATING THE UPTAKE THROUGH THE TREE&#39;S NATURAL HYDRAULIC CONDUCTING CAPACITY WITHOUT CAUSING HARM TO THE TREE. THIS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO AN EFFICIENT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) FOR CLAS AND ACP THAT WILL SUPPLEMENT OR MAY EVEN REPLACE FOLIAR SPRAYS.SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH THE STUDY OF TREE PHYSIOLOGY, SPECIFICALLY VASCULAR TRANSPORT OF LIQUID MATERIALS THROUGH THE CITRUS TREE TO OPTIMIZE TIME AND MODE OF DELIVERY. THIS FOUR-YEAR PROJECT ADDRESSES THE CITRUS DISEASE SUB-COMMITTEE PRIORITY 1, 3 AND 4: THERAPIES TO PREVENT OR SUPPRESS CLAS BACTERIA WITHIN TREES; IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY OF INFECTED TREES, INCLUDING ROOT HEALTH; AND SYSTEMS FOR DELIVERY OF THERAPIES INTO THE PHLOEM OF CITRUS TREES, INCLUDING THE ROOT SYSTEM.OUR PROJECT OBJECTIVES ARE:DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTOMATED AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE SYSTEM TO EFFICIENTLY DELIVER HLB-THERAPEUTIC MATERIALS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BACTERICIDES) TO CITRUS TREES.DECIPHERING THE PATH OF CITRUS VASCULAR TRANSPORT FOR UPTAKE, MOVEMENT, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THERAPEUTIC MATERIALS THROUGHOUT THE PLANT.OPTIMIZATION OF THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION THROUGH DELINEATION OF DAILY AND SEASONAL VASCULAR TRANSPORT DYNAMICS OF CITRUS TREES.EVALUATION OF THE ADS IN FIELD-GROWN CITRUS TREES.EVALUATION OF THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF ADOPTING THE ADS AND COMPARISON OF ITS BENEFITS WITH CURRENTLY USED DISEASE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN FLORIDA, TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA.DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENERGETIC OUTREACH AND EXTENSION PROGRAM.IN SUMMARY, OUR PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW SYSTEM OF DELIVERY THAT EFFICIENTLY AND HOMOGENOUSLY DELIVERS ANY TYPE OF LIQUID MATERIAL WITH THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPRESS OR CURE HLB OR OTHER DISEASES INTO THE VASCULAR TRANSPORT SYSTEM OF CITRUS TREES. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL INTRODUCE THE MATERIALS THROUGH NUMEROUS SMALL PUNCTURES CREATED BY MULTIPLE SMALL NEEDLES SURROUNDING THE TREE TRUNK. NUMEROUS OPENINGS IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AROUND THE TRUNK WILL ENSURE THE EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS WITHIN THE VASCULATURE, CONTRARY TO SINGLE-NEEDLE INJECTION. INJURY AND/OR HARM TO THE TREE, PARTICULARLY THE DESTRUCTION OF VESSEL ELEMENTS AT THE APPLICATION SITE, WILL BE MINIMIZED BY THE SMALLER SIZE OF THE NEEDLES AND THE EXCLUSION OF HIGH PRESSURE FOR DELIVERY OF MATERIAL. RAPID DELIVERY WILL BE ENSURED BY USING A LARGE NUMBER OF NEEDLES TO CREATE NUMEROUS OPENINGS THROUGH WHICH THE MATERIAL WILL ENTER INTO THE VASCULATURE. UPTAKE AND TRANSPORT OF THE LIQUID WILL OCCUR THROUGH THE TREE&#39;S NATURAL HYDRAULIC CONDUCTING CAPACITY. THE LATTER WILL BE HELD IN A RESERVOIR SURROUNDING THE APPLICATION SITE AND ALLOWING UPTAKE OF THE MATERIAL ACCORDING TO THE TREES NATURAL TRANSPORT CAPACITY. AUTOMATION OF THE SYSTEM WILL FACILITATE APPLICATION AND GREATLY REDUCE ANY LABOR-ASSOCIATED COSTS. WE WILL ALSO CONDUCT DETAILED INVESTIGATIONS ON THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF CITRUS TREES WITH EMPHASIS ON XYLEM VESSEL ARRANGEMENT, DAILY AND SEASONAL PATTERNS OF WATER CONDUCTANCE, AND MOVEMENT OF MATERIALS TO AND WITHIN THE PHLOEM.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "369ac1e4-8d93-3063-b933-3586dffba549-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20197001629096_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 81071178, "Award ID": "20197001629068", "Award Amount": 3941090.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-05-16", "CFDA Number": "10.309", "Description": "NEW CULTIVARS OF CROP PLANTS ARE OFTEN NEEDED TO ADDRESS EMERGING CHALLENGES, TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FARMERS, TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE CROP CULTIVATION METHODS, AND TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CITRUS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS FACED WITH A DEADLY DISEASE, HUANGLONGBING (HLB) OR CITRUS GREENING THAT HAS RAVAGED MANY CITRUS GROWING REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY AND HAS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN OTHER AREAS WHERE THE DISEASE IS NOW SPREADING. THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISEASE, THE UN-CULTURABLE NATURE OF THE ASSOCIATED CAUSAL ORGANISM, AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PATHOSYSTEM MAKE CONTROLLING THIS DISEASE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. A REVIEW PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE IN 2018 SUMMARIZED THE RESULTS OF ABOUT 12 YEARS OF RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE CITRUS HLB PROBLEM AND DECLARED THAT HLB MAY BE THE GREATEST CHALLENGE FACED BY THE CITRUS INDUSTRIES IN THE WESTERN WORLD. SINCE CITRUS IS ECONOMICALLY AND CULTURALLY VERY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA, WE NEED TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS FOR LONG TERM CULTIVATION OF THIS IMPORTANT FRUIT CROP. THE DISEASE IS ASSOCIATED WITH CANDIDATUS LIBERIBACTER ASIATICUS, AN UNCULTURABLE ALPHA-PROTEOBACTERIUM AND IS SPREAD BY THE ASIAN CITRUS PSYLLID. EFFICIENT DISEASE MITIGATION WILL BE FEASIBLE WITH ADEQUATE VECTOR CONTROL. IMPLEMENTING MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES FOR DISEASE MITIGATION WILL ALSO RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR CULTIVATING CITRUS AND SOME OF THE APPROACHES PRACTICED NOW MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES, IN FLORIDA WHERE THE DISEASE HAS ESTABLISHED FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS, THE COST FOR CARING OF AN ACRE OF CITRUS HAS INCREASED FROM AN AVERAGE OF $769 IN THE YEAR 2000 TO ABOUT $2376 IN 2017. ENVIRONMENTALLY AND ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS FOR CITRUS CULTIVATION IN PRESENCE OF HLB WILL REQUIRE DEVELOPMENT OF DISEASE RESISTANCE. AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL VARIETIES THAT ARE RESISTANT WILL PROVIDE LONG-TERM, ECO-FRIENDLY, AND COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE. THERE IS NO REPORT OF RESISTANCE TO HLB IN CITRUS. BECAUSE OF LONG CULTIVATION AND VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION METHODS USED ROUTINELY, NEW GENETIC MATERIAL IS OFTEN NOT INTRODUCED INTO CULTIVATED CITRUS AND THE CURRENTLY GROWN VARIETIES HAVE A NARROW GENETIC BASE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN RELATED GENERA IN THE CITRUS FAMILY ARE HLB RESISTANT OR HIGHLY TOLERANT. WE HAVE EXPLORED THE GENETIC DIVERSITY IN CLOSE RELATIVES OF CITRUS AND IDENTIFIED SOURCES OF HLB RESISTANCE IN AUSTRALIAN LIMES. USING THESE SEXUALLY COMPATIBLE DISEASE RESISTANT TAXA, WE HAVE GENERATED HYBRIDS OF CITRUS BY BREEDING WITH HLB RESISTANT CITRUS RELATIVES. MANY OF THE HYBRID PLANTS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED ARE VERY PROMISING SINCE THEY DO NOT HARBOR THE HLB PATHOGEN FOR EXTENDED PERIODS (MORE THAN TWO YEARS). OUR HYBRIDS ARE NOW UNDERGOING FIELD EVALUATIONS. ONE CAVEAT IS THAT THE HYBRID PLANTS INHERIT UNDESIRABLE FRUIT CHARACTERS ALONG WITH RESISTANCE TRAITS FROM THE CITRUS RELATIVE PARENT.TRADITIONAL BREEDING TO ELIMINATE UNWANTED FRUIT CHARACTERS WHILE MAINTAINING RESISTANCE WILL BE FEASIBLE BUT TIME CONSUMING. CITRUS HAS A GENERATION TIME OF 4-7 YEARS (DEPENDING ON CULTIVARS). USING A BREEDING POPULATION OF HYBRID PLANTS THAT ARE EITHER RESISTANT OR SUSCEPTIBLE, WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE MODERN GENETICS METHODS TO GENERATE MOLECULAR TOOLS THAT WILL BE USEFUL IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIAL CITRUS CULTIVARS RESISTANT TO HLB. NOVEL INNOVATIVE METHODS OF CROP IMPROVEMENT ARE NOW POSSIBLE WITH ADVANCED AND AFFORDABLE SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES, GENE EDITING PROCEDURES AND ABILITY TO PYRAMID USEFUL GENES IN TRANSFORMED PLANTS. IDENTIFICATION OF TARGET GENES AND AVAILABILITY OF RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED GENES WILL BE NECESSARY TO UTILIZE THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO OUR ADVANTAGE. ADVANCES IN GENETICS AND GENOMICS MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIS OF RESISTANCE AND IDENTIFY GENES THAT CAN THEN BE INTRODUCED INTO SPECIFIC CULTIVARS SO THAT HLB RESISTANCE CAN BE DEVELOPED IN COMMERCIAL CULTIVARS WITHOUT ALTERING THE DESIRABLE HORTICULTURAL TRAITS. IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE HYBRID POPULATIONS OF CITRUS (DERIVED FROM CROSSING CITRUS WITH DISEASE RESISTANT RELATIVE GENERA) TO GENERATE SEQUENCE INFORMATION THAT WILL LEAD TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF GENOMIC REGIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HLB RESISTANCE. USING A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL GENOMIC APPROACHES (WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING, LOW DEPTH SKIM SEQUENCING OF HLB RESISTANT AND SUSCEPTIBLE F1 POPULATIONS, POOLED GENOME APPROACH, TRANSCRIPTOME PROFILING, QPCR ANALYSIS FOR DETERMINING GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES, AND BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS), WE PROPOSE TO IDENTIFY GENES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HLB RESISTANCE. FOR PROOF OF CONCEPT, WE WILL CLONE THE PUTATIVE RESISTANCE ASSOCIATED GENES INTO SUITABLE PLANT TRANSFORMATION VECTORS AND TRANSFORM A MODEL CITRUS PLANT, DUNCAN GRAPEFRUIT. THE TRANSFORMED PLANT WILL BE TESTED FOR PRESENCE OF TRANSGENE, EXPRESSION LEVELS, STABILITY, AND EVALUATED FOR HLB RESISTANCE. USEFUL CONSTRUCTS/GENES/INFORMATION ABOUT RESISTANT GENES WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR GENERATING DISEASE RESISTANT CITRUS CULTIVARS USING MANY NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES. DEVELOPMENT OF GENOMICS-BASED TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED TO SELECT POTENTIALLY RESISTANT PROGENY WILL ALSO ACCELERATE TRADITIONAL BREEDING APPROACHES. GENES FOR HLB RESISTANCE, ONCE IDENTIFIED AND VALIDATED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, RIVERSIDE, WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER MECHANISMS, INCLUDING PATENTING AND LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP), INTER-INSTITUTIONAL, MATERIAL TRANSFER, AND CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS, SO THAT OTHERS CAN INCORPORATE THE HLB RESISTANT GENES INTO VARIOUS CITRUS CULTIVARS TO EXPEDITIOUSLY TRANSLATE THE RESEARCH RESULTS FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATION TO SUPPORT THE CITRUS INDUSTRY.

THERAPIES TO PREVENT OR SUPPRESS CANDIDATUS LIBERIBACTER ASIATICUS (CLAS) BACTERIA WITHIN TREES. OUR PROJECT IS BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE HLB RESISTANCE/TOLERANCE TRAITS OBSERVED IN CITRUS HYBRIDS AND CLOSE RELATIVES ARE DETERMINED BY A SET OF MASTER DEFENSE REGULATORS. BY COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS BETWEEN HLB-SENSITIVE CULTIVARS AND HLB-RESISTANT/TOLERANT CITRUS HYBRIDS AND RELATIVES, SUCH AS EREMOCITRUS GLAUCA, MICROCITRUS AUSTRALIASICA, AND PONCIRUS TRIFOLIATA, WE IDENTIFIED AND CLONED A NOVEL CLASS OF ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES(APS) THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY INHIBIT/KILL THREE DIFFERENT LIBERIBACTER SPECIES, 1) CLAS THAT INFECTS CITRUS, 2) CANDIDATUS LIBERIBACTER SOLANACEARUM THAT INFECTS ALL SOLANACEOUS PLANTS AND 3) LIBERIBACTER CRESCENS, A CULTURABLE BACTERIUM THAT INFECTS PAPAYA, WHICH WE ARE USING AS A SURROGATE FOR THE UNCULTURABLE CLAS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE APS HAVE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE DISTINCT FROM OTHER ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES AND MAKE THEM THE IDEAL SOLUTIONS FOR CONTROLLING HLB. FIRST, THE APS CAN STIMULATE IMMUNE RESPONSES IN CITRUS PLANTS, WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP PROTECTANTS USING APS TO VACCINATE HEALTHY SEEDLINGS. SECOND, THE APS ARE SAFE FOR HUMANS AND ANIMALS BECAUSE THEY ARE DERIVED FROM CITRUS AND CITRUS RELATIVES AND ARE PRESENT IN FRUIT OF AUSTRALIAN FINGER LIME AND LEMON, WHICH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONSUMING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. THIRD, THE APS ARE STABLE AND CAN WITHSTAND HIGH TEMPERATURES AND PROTEOLYSIS IN PLANTS. FOURTH, THE APS HAVE NO OBVIOUS PHYTOTOXICITY IN CITRUS. AND FIFTH, SYNTHESIS OF THE APS IS COST-EFFECTIVE. UNLIKE MOST OTHER ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES THAT ARE CYSTINE-RICH AND REQUIRE DISULFIDE BOND FORMATION TO BE ACTIVE, OUR APS DO NOT CONTAIN MANY CYSTINE RESIDUES, WHICH ALLOWS IN VITRO SYNTHESIS OF ACTIVE MOLECULES EASILY AND AT LOW COST.WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THERAPIES AND PROTECTANTS USING AP SOLUTIONS AND PERFORM AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE COST EFFICIENCY OF DIFFERENT APPLICATION METHODS FOR TREATING HLB-POSITIVE TREES AND PROPHYLACTICALLY PROTECTING HEALTHY YOUNG TREES AGAINST CLAS INFECTION.

BY FOCUSING OUR RESEARCH AND OUTREACH EFFORTS ON YOUNG-PLANT PRODUCTION, WE PROPOSE TO LEVERAGE PF TECHNOLOGIES IN WAYS THAT CAN HELP SOLVE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS AFFECTING SPECIALTY CROPS GROWERS. YOUNG PLANTS (WHICH INCLUDE SEEDLING PLUGS, ROOTED CUTTINGS, AND TISSUE-CULTURED MICROCUTTINGS) ARE SUITED FOR INDOOR FARMING IN PFS BECAUSE THEY TYPICALLY HAVE A SHORT HEIGHT, SHORT PRODUCTION TIME, LOW ENERGY DEMAND ON A PER PLANT BASIS, AND A HIGH ECONOMIC VALUE. AVAILABILITY OF HIGH-QUALITY YOUNG PLANTS IS CRUCIAL TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESS OF MOST CROPS TRANSPLANTED INTO BOTH OPEN FIELD AND PROTECTED CULTIVATION (I.E., HIGH TUNNEL AND GREENHOUSE). MOREOVER, REGARDLESS OF COMMODITY, YOUNG-PLANT PRODUCERS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE SPECIALTY CROPS INDUSTRY IN THE U.S. THEREFORE, RESEARCH FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY OF HIGH-VALUE YOUNG PLANTS THAT HAVE HIGH CROP LOSS RATES, ARE OF POOR QUALITY WHEN PRODUCED WITH STANDARD PRACTICES, OR EXPERIENCE SLOW ROOTING, HAS POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS SCRI PLANNING PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEEDS FOR RESEARCH, OUTREACH, AND EDUCATION OF INDOOR FARMING IN PFS, RESULTING IN A SCRI-SREP PROPOSAL THAT CAN PROVIDE LOW-RISK, COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY OF YOUNG PLANTS. TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL WE WILL FOCUS ON THREE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: 1) FORMALIZE A PROJECT ADVISORY COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF A KEY GROUP OF GROWERS, INDUSTRY, AND ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATIVES; 2) THROUGH THE USE OF A SURVEY AND A LISTENING SESSION, ASSESS SPECIALTY CROP GROWERS&#39; INTERESTS IN PFS AND IDENTIFY ECONOMICALLY-SIGNIFICANT SPECIALTY CROPS THAT COULD BE ECONOMICALLY PROPAGATED IN PFS; AND 3) HOST A MEETING WITH MEMBERS OF THE PROJECT TEAM TO DEVELOP A SCRI-SREP PROPOSAL TO BE SUBMITTED DURING THE 2019-2020 SCRI FUNDING CYCLE.

CITRUS IS THE MOST ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT FRUIT TREE CROP IN FLORIDA, CONTRIBUTING SUBSTANTIALLY TO EMPLOYMENT, AND PROVIDING CULTURAL CONTEXT FOR MANY GENERATIONS OF GROWERS. CITRUS HAD AN ESTIMATED ON-TREE FRUIT VALUE OF $1.5 BILLION FOR 2006-7 PRIOR TO HLB DISEASE, AND DECLINED TO $0.82 BILLION FOR 2015-16. THE VALUE-ADDED PROCESSED ORANGE AND GRAPEFRUIT JUICE BRINGS THE INDUSTRY VALUE TO $8-9 BILLION PRIOR TO THIS DISEASE.

IN FLORIDA, HLB IS A DISASTER FOR THE CITRUS INDUSTRY. HLB IS IN TEXAS WITH SPREAD INCREASING. IN CALIFORNIA, THERE ARE ACCELERATED FINDS IN RESIDENTIAL TREES AND THE INSECT THAT SPREADS THE DISEASE CONTINUES EXPANDING INTO COMMERCIAL AREAS. WITHOUT NEW SOLUTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE CITRUS INDUSTRIES MAY FOLLOW A PATTERN SIMILAR TO THAT IN FLORIDA. IN FLORIDA, HLB HAS SPREAD TO ALMOST ALL TREES, REDUCING YIELDS AND THE QUALITY OF JUICE. SINCE 2005, WHEN HLB WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED, TOTAL CITRUS PRODUCTION IN FLORIDA HAS SHRUNK BY MORE THAN 50%, AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTRACTION OF THE FLORIDA CITRUS INDUSTRY THAT IS CAUSING CLOSURE OF CITRUS PACKING AND PROCESSING PLANTS. CITRUS IS THE MAJOR AGRICULTURAL CROP IN FLORIDA, VALUED AT $10 BILLION AND PROVIDES 76,000 JOBS. FOR MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES CITRUS IS THE ECONOMIC BASE OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA IS ONLY SECOND TO FLORIDA IN TOTAL CITRUS ACREAGE, BUT HAS A LARGER SHARE OF THE HIGHER VALUE, FRESH MARKET PRODUCE. ACCELERATING PESSIMISM CONCERNING THE SURVIVAL OF THIS MAJOR INDUSTRY IS OVERTAKING FLORIDA. THERE ARE NO IDENTIFIED ALTERNATIVE CROPS TO REPLACE THE USE OF THE NEARLY 435,300 REMAINING ACRES OF CITRUS AND ITS INFRASTRUCTURE. SURVIVAL OF THE JUICE MARKET IN FLORIDA REQUIRES NEW PLANTINGS TO INCREASE OVERALL PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, WITHOUT RESISTANT OR TOLERANT CITRUS TREES, CONTROLLING THE INSECT THAT SPREADS THE DISEASE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE PRODUCTIVITY IN MOST NEW PLANTINGS. CALIFORNIA IS BEING EXTREMELY PRO-ACTIVE IN ITS EFFORTS TO PREVENT HLB ESTABLISHMENT, AND DESPITE THAT, THE INSECT THAT SPREADS THE DISEASE IS NOW ESTABLISHED. RESTORATION OF THE FLORIDA CITRUS INDUSTRY REQUIRES NEW TREES THAT BETTER TOLERATE THE INFECTION OR REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE AND THEY ARE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY. TRANSGENIC CITRUS TREES THAT ARE TOLERANT TO HLB AND PREVENT REPRODUCTION OF THE INSECT THAT SPREADS THE DISEASE HAVE BEEN PRODUCED. HOWEVER, THESE TREES ARE GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS (GMOS) THAT THAT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS THAT CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN TIME TO SAVE THE FLORIDA CITRUS INDUSTRY. ADDITIONALLY, THE INDUSTRY WOULD HAVE TO SELL A GMO PRODUCT. FOR THESE REASONS, WE PROPOSE TO RECREATE HLB RESISTANCE OR TOLERANCE BASED ON THE TRANSGENIC RESULTS USING A NEW TECHNOLOGY KNOWN AS TRANSGENE-FREE GENE EDITING. CITRUS TREES PRODUCED USING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL BE NON-GMOS AND WITHOUT TIME-CONSUMING REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN BE DELIVERED TO THE INDUSTRY MORE QUICKLY.

EVOLUTION OF MULTIPLE HERBICIDE RESISTANCE IN THIS SPECIES IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AS THIS TREND HAS BEEN QUICKLY REMOVING IMPORTANT HERBICIDE OPTIONS FROM THE TURF MANAGER&#39;S TOOLBOX.THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR DEVELOPING SOUND BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPS) BASED ON A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ECOLOGY AND BIOLOGY OF ANNUAL BLUEGRASS, CURRENT LEVELS OF HERBICIDE RESISTANCE, AND THE NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF RESISTANCE EVOLUTION AND SPREAD IN THIS SPECIES. LIMITED INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON THE LONGEVITY OF ANNUAL BLUEGRASS SEED IN THE SOIL. A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF SEEDLING EMERGENCE PATTERNS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS GOVERNING EMERGENCE IS YET TO BE DEVELOPED, BUT WILL DIRECTLY INFORM APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT TIMING. SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE LINKED WITH WEATHER FORECASTS TO PROVIDE SEEDLING EMERGENCE ADVISORIES. MOREOVER, A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF PHENOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AS INFLUENCED BY ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, AND KNOWLEDGE OF DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS SUCH AS FECUNDITY WILL BE BENEFICIAL.AN IMPORTANT LESSON FROM HERBICIDE RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT IN AGRONOMIC CROPS IS THAT DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING BMPS THAT DO NOT CONSIDER HUMAN AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF HERBICIDE RESISTANCE ARE INEFFECTIVE. A ROBUST INTEGRATION OF HUMAN AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS WITH THE BIOPHYSICAL ASPECTS OF HERBICIDE RESISTANCE IS CRITICAL IN INNOVATING EFFECTIVE WEED MANAGEMENT APPROACHES (ERVIN AND JUSSAUME 2014; ERVIN AND FRISVOLD 2016). THE HERBICIDE RESISTANCE EPIDEMIC IN ANNUAL BLUEGRASS IN MANAGED TURF SYSTEMS HAS LIKELY RESULTED FROM THE INTERACTION OF BIOPHYSICAL AND SOCIAL (BEHAVIORAL) SYSTEMS. A TURF MANAGER&#39;S DECISION TO RELY ON A NARROW SPECTRUM OF HERBICIDES FOR WEED CONTROL MAY BE INFLUENCED BY SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, SUCH AS RELATIVE PRICES AND PERSONAL VALUES. THUS, TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE ANNUAL BLUEGRASS RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT, WE MUST UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE VARIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND BIOPHYSICAL FACTORS THAT SERVE AS BARRIERS TO BMP ADOPTION.PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORTING HYPOTHESES1) CONDUCT SURVEYS AND DOCUMENT THE EXTENT OF ANNUAL BLUEGRASS SUSCEPTIBILITY/RESISTANCE TO KEY TURF HERBICIDES AND DEVELOP METHODS FOR RAPID RESISTANCE DETECTION [HYPOTHESIS: ANNUAL BLUEGRASS RESISTANCE IS PREVALENT IN MANAGED TURF SYSTEMS], 2) ESTABLISH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE PREVALENT IN ANNUAL BLUEGRASS ACROSS A REGIONAL SCALE [HYPOTHESIS: THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE OF NON-TARGET SITE RESISTANCE IN ANNUAL BLUEGRASS POPULATIONS], 3) GENERATE INFORMATION TO FILL CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAPS ON THE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF ANNUAL BLUEGRASS [HYPOTHESIS: ANNUAL BLUEGRASS EXHIBITS PROLONGED SEED PERSISTENCE IN SOIL WITH EXTENDED EMERGENCE PERIODICITY], 4) EVALUATE AND OPTIMIZE INNOVATIVE WEED MANAGEMENT OPTIONS FOR INTEGRATION [HYPOTHESIS: NOVEL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES CAN BE OPTIMIZED TO PROVIDE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON WEED GROWTH AND SEED PRODUCTION], 5) SURVEY TURFGRASS MANAGERS TO IDENTIFY SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND OTHER BARRIERS TO THE ADOPTION OF HERBICIDE RESISTANCE BMPS [HYPOTHESIS: A THOROUGH SOCIO-ECONOMIC INVESTIGATION WILL HELP IDENTIFY FACTORS INFLUENCING WEED MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING BY TURFGRASS PRACTITIONERS], 6) DEVELOP A USER-FRIENDLY BIO-ECONOMIC DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL FOR FACILITATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BMPS [HYPOTHESIS: DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS WILL ALLOW FOR EASY VISUALIZATION OF THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS MANAGEMENT OPTIONS ON LONG-TERM ECONOMICS, WEED POPULATION SIZE AND RISK OF RESISTANCE OVER SHORT-TERM RETURNS], 7) DEVELOP AND DELIVER AN EXTENSION PROGRAM FOR SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF ANNUAL BLUEGRASS [HYPOTHESIS: ROBUST OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT UTILIZE ADVANCED TOOLS WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING BMP ADOPTION], AND 8) PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF RESEARCH AND EXTENSION SCIENTISTS AND TURFGRASS PRACTITIONERS [HYPOTHESIS: INVOLVING UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLARS IN RESEARCH AND EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING IN PREPARING THEM FOR TACKLING SIMILAR ISSUES IN FUTURE].STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENTTHE TEAM RECOGNIZES THE VITAL NEED FOR ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS IN DEFINING THE PROBLEM AND INTEGRATING THEIR EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE INTO BMP STRATEGIES. THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BASED ON CRITICAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE MANAGED TURF INDUSTRY. THESE INCLUDE: REGIONAL AND NATIONAL TURF INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS, TURFGRASS SOD PRODUCER GROUPS, GOLF COURSE SUPERINTENDENTS, ATHLETIC TURF MANAGERS, AND SCIENTISTS-AT-LARGE, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE GLOBAL HERBICIDE RESISTANCE ACTION COMMITTEE (HRAC) AND THE WEED SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA (WSSA). A STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY PANEL HAS BEEN FORMED INVOLVING KEY PERSONNEL FROM THE ABOVE SECTORS. A DETAILED STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PLAN HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO ENSURE SUSTAINED ENGAGEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION PHASES.BROADER IMPACTS OF THIS PROPOSALTHE PRODUCTS AND DELIVERABLES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE BROADER TURFGRASS INDUSTRY ACROSS THE NATION, INCLUDING THE STATES AND REGIONS NOT DIRECTLY REPRESENTED IN THE PROPOSAL. THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ISSUES AFFECTING WEED MANAGEMENT DECISION-MAKING AND ADOPTION OF BMPS ARE COMPARABLE IN THOSE AREAS. MOST OF THE NON-CHEMICAL TACTICS TO BE OPTIMIZED AND THE BMPS TO BE FORMULATED CAN BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OTHER TURF WEEDS AS WELL. THUS, THE SOLUTIONS TO BE DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT HERBICIDE RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT IN TURF WEEDS NATIONWIDE. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPOSED OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WILL DEVELOP A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING AMONG THE BROADER STAKEHOLDERS OF PESTICIDE RESISTANCE EVOLUTION IN ANY BIOLOGICAL ORGANISM AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE IPM PRACTICES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL TURF PESTS (WEEDS, DISEASES, INSECTS, AND NEMATODES).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d717ce39-5517-7fb6-1836-967d1cf594fd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20185118128436_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 67603461, "Award ID": "20185118128435", "Award Amount": 3291766.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-07-23", "CFDA Number": "10.309", "Description": "ONION AND GARLIC ARE AMONG THE MOST VALUABLE VEGETABLE CROPS IN THE US AND WORLD.

IN GREENHOUSES, MOST ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES CAN BE CONTROLLED TO PROVIDE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR PLANT GROWTH. LIGHT TYPICALLY IS LESS CONTROLLED THAN OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN LIGHT LEVELS AND THUS CROP YIELD AND QUALITY. THE VARIABILITY CAN BE SPATIAL, SPECTRAL, AND TEMPORAL AND OCCURS ON SHORT (WITHIN A DAY), INTERMEDIATE (DAY-TO-DAY), AND LONG (SEASONAL) TIME SCALES. FOR EFFICIENT YEAR-ROUND PRODUCTION IN GREENHOUSES, SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHT IS OFTEN BENEFICIAL, BUT THE EXPENSES CAN BE HIGH. THE ELECTRICITY REQUIRED FOR SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHTING IN GREENHOUSES ACCOUNTS FOR 20-30% OF VARIABLE COSTS. SINCE TYPICAL GREENHOUSE PROFIT MARGINS ARE 1-5%, MORE COST-EFFECTIVE LIGHTING STRATEGIES CAN HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE PROFIT MARGIN. PLANT FACTORIES, AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY WHERE PLANTS ARE GROWN INDOORS, PROVIDE TOTAL CONTROL OVER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, BUT PRODUCTION RELIES ENTIRELY ON ELECTRIC LIGHTING, ACCOUNTING FOR 50-60% OF THE VARIABLE COSTS. CLEARLY, MORE COST-EFFECTIVE LIGHTING APPROACHES WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE SUSTAINABILITY AND PROFITABILITY OF CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE (GREENHOUSES AND PLANT FACTORIES), REDUCE ENERGY USE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND THUS ALSO PROVIDE SOCIETAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS.THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE PAST RESEARCH ON OPTIMIZING THE ECONOMIC RETURN OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHTING PRACTICES FOR GREENHOUSE PRODUCTION (FLORICULTURE AND VEGETABLES) AND MOST PAST WORK HAS FOCUSED ON HIGH-PRESSURE SODIUM (HPS) LIGHTS. LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE (LED) LIGHTS ARE GRADUALLY BECOMING CHEAPER AND MORE EFFICIENT, AND ARE INCREASINGLY BEING USED INSTEAD OF HPS LIGHTS. HOWEVER, LED LIGHTS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE TO INSTALL THAN HPS LIGHTS, SO TO JUSTIFY THE CAPITAL EXPENSE, LED LIGHTS NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL VALUE COMPARED TO HPS. THAT VALUE CAN COME FROM LOWER OPERATING COSTS, HIGHER YIELDS, BETTER QUALITY, OR THE PRODUCTION OF HIGHER VALUE SPECIALTY CROPS.LED LIGHTS PROVIDE IMPORTANT NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF LIGHTING, BECAUSE BOTH THE SPECTRUM AND LIGHT INTENSITY CAN BE ACCURATELY CONTROLLED. THIS CAN GIVE GROWERS BETTER CONTROL OVER CROP GROWTH AND QUALITY. HOWEVER, CURRENT LED GROW LIGHTS DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ABILITY TO PRECISELY CONTROL LIGHT INTENSITY AND SPECTRUM IN REAL TIME. WE WILL HELP GROWERS GET MORE VALUE OUT OF THEIR LIGHTING SYSTEM BY PROVIDING HORTICULTURAL AND ECONOMICAL INFORMATION AND TOOLS TO MANAGE THE LIGHTS FOR OPTIMAL CROP GROWTH AND QUALITY.THE ELECTRICAL COST ASSOCIATED WITH LIGHTING OFTEN IS THE SECOND LARGEST VARIABLE COST IN GREENHOUSES AFTER LABOR, AND ARE THE BIGGEST COST IN PLANT FACTORIES. INCREASING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF LIGHTING WILL LOWER PRODUCTION COSTS AND/OR INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE CROP (BY INCREASING QUALITY OR YIELD), WHICH CAN INCREASE THE MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY OF CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE.WE WILL HELP GROWERS MAKE BETTER LIGHTING DECISIONS. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL: 1) DEVELOP TOOLS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHTING IS COST-EFFECTIVE FOR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, 2) DECIDE WHETHER HPS OR LED LIGHTS ARE MORE COST-EFFECTIVE FOR A GIVEN APPLICATION, AND 3) DEVELOP GUIDELINES TO HELP GROWERS GET THE MOST VALUE OUT OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHTING BY MINIMIZING OPERATING COSTS AND/OR MAXIMIZING CROP QUALITY. WE WILL DEVELOP MODELS THAT CONSIDER CROP PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, CROP VALUE, THE DESIGN AND CAPITAL COSTS OF THE LIGHTING SYSTEM, REAL-TIME ELECTRICITY PRICING, AND CURRENT AND FORECASTED LIGHT LEVELS. THESE MODELS WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHT IN THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TOOLS TO HELP GROWERS IMPLEMENT THESE LIGHTING STRATEGIES, BASED ON CROP NEEDS AND SPECIFIC GROWING SYSTEMS. THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF THESE LIGHTINGSTRATEGIES WILL BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHTING.A COMPREHENSIVE OUTREACH PLAN WILL ENSURE THAT PROJECT FINDINGS ARE DISSEMINATED IN DIFFERENT FORMS TO REACH THE GROWERS AND ASSOCIATED CEA INDUSTRIES. OUTREACH EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE A WEBSITE, WEBINARS, PRESENTATIONS, ONLINE ARTICLES, TRADE JOURNAL ARTICLES, EXTENSION VISITS AND PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL ARTICLES.

BEYOND SIMPLY SHARING RESEARCH RESULTS, THE DECISION-MAKING TOOLS WE DEVELOP WILL DIRECTLY ASSIST INDUSTRY MEMBERS AND ALLOW DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RESEARCH RESULTS. WE WILL DEVELOP DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO ENABLE GROWERS TO ASSESS WHETHER USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHTING (AND TO WHAT DEGREE) IS ECONOMICAL, GIVEN THEIR CROPS AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. IF LIGHTING IS DEEMED PROFITABLE, THE TOOLS CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER HPS OR LED LIGHTS ARE MORECOST-EFFECTIVE BASED ON THE TYPE OF FACILITY, PATTERNS OF LIGHTING USE, AND ELECTRICITY COST. VIRTUAL GROWER, A FREELY-AVAILABLE USDA-ARS GREENHOUSE SIMULATION TOOL, WILL BE UPGRADED TO INCLUDE SIMULATIONS OF DIFFERENT LIGHTING SCENARIOS. THESE TOOLS WILL BE AVAILABLE ON-LINE, WITH INSTRUCTIONS AND RECORDED WEBINARS EXPLAINING HOW TO USE THEM. WE ALSO WILL DEVELOP SOFTWARE AND CONTROLLERS FOR GROWERS TO IMPLEMENT COST-EFFECTIVE LIGHTING STRATEGIES, BASED ON OUR RESEARCH FINDINGS. THESE TOOLS WILL HELP DRIVE INDUSTRY ADOPTION OF ENERGY-EFFICIENT, COST-EFFECTIVE LIGHTING TECHNOLOGIES.COLLABORATION WITH LIGHTING COMPANIES WILL BE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT AND THESE COMPANIES WILL BE INVITED TO OUR ANNUAL PROJECT MEETINGS TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON PROJECT PROGRESS AND DIRECTION.

IN THE US, HLB IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHLOEM-COLONIZING, INSECT-TRANSMITTED BACTERIUM CANDIDATUS LIBERIBACTER ASIATICUS (LAS). SINCE NO CURES FOR HLB ARE AVAILABLE AND TRUE RESISTANCE IN CITRUS HAS NOT BEEN FOUND, METHODOLOGIES THAT EFFECTIVELY DETECT LAS IN LARGE-SCALE SET-UPS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANT CITRUS VARIETIES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED FOR A LONG-TERM SOLUTION.ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VIRULENCE MECHANISMS UTILIZED BY BACTERIAL PATHOGENS IS MANIPULATION OF HOST IMMUNITY AND PHYSIOLOGY THROUGH THE FUNCTION OF SECRETED EFFECTOR PROTEINS. LAS POSSESSES THE SEC SECRETION SYSTEM, THROUGH WHICH A VARIETY OF SEC-DELIVERED EFFECTORS (SDES) COULD BE SECRETED INTO THE CITRUS PHLOEM.

EXTENSIVE AND STRONG NATIONAL/INTERNATIONAL MARKETS (CURRENTLY $3.26 BILLION) EXIST FOR HAZELNUT PRODUCTS AND POWERFUL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS (FOR PRODUCERS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES) WOULD BE GENERATED BY LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF HYBRID HAZELNUTS IN THE US. HAZELNUTS ARE AN IDEAL CHOICE TO INTEGRATE INTO PROFITABLE, SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL OR AGROFORESTRY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, AND ARE FAMILY-FRIENDLY FOR SMALL PRODUCERS FOCUSED ON LOCAL FOOD ISSUES. HAZELNUTS COULD BECOME A \"THIRD CROP\" IN THE MIDWEST AND GREAT PLAINS (ALONG WITH CORN AND SOYBEANS), AND HAVE CONSIDERABLE VALUE AS A SPECIALTY CROP IN EASTERN STATES (FRUIT BELT REGION). ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF HAZELNUT PRODUCTION INCLUDE REDUCED RUNOFF AND SOIL EROSION, ENHANCED WATER QUALITY, RELATIVELY FEW INPUTS OF FERTILIZERS AND PESTICIDES, IMPROVED WILDLIFE HABITATS, AND INCREASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION - IMPACTS THAT BENEFIT FARM FAMILIES AND RESIDENTS OF BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. FURTHER, THEY CAN BE GROWN WITHOUT IRRIGATION IN MANY REGIONS AND DO NOT REQUIRE BEES FOR POLLINATION. HAZELNUT KERNELS ARE WIDELY RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR HEALTH PROMOTING EFFECTS, HAVE A LONG STORAGE LIFE, AND HAVE ROBUST LOCAL-TO-INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FOR A VARIETY OF VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS. THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF HAZELNUT IS DOCUMENTED BY OREGON'S ANNUAL ACREAGE INCREASE (3,000 ACRES SINCE 2009), WORLD ANNUAL PRODUCTION (870,000 METRIC TONS/YEAR), THE WHOLESALE PRICE/POUND OF DRY, UNSHELLED NUTS ($1.70) AND THE WORLD ANNUAL HAZELNUT REVENUE ($3.26 BILLION). ACROSS THE CENTRAL STATES, MANY PRODUCERS LOOKING TO DIVERSIFY THEIR OPERATIONS BEYOND CORN AND SOYBEANS HAVE SHOWN INTENSE INTEREST IN HAZELNUTS.

THEIR RAPID AND WIDESPREAD ADOPTION, INCLUDING REGISTRATION FOR USE ON VIRTUALLY ALL FIELD AND HORTICULTURAL CROPS, IS LARGELY DUE TO THEIR: A) HIGH SELECTIVITY TOWARDS INSECTS WITH LOW MAMMALIAN TOXICITY, MAKING NEONICS RELATIVELY SAFE TO HUMANS COMPARED WITH OLDER INSECTICIDE CLASSES; B) HIGH WATER SOLUBILITY, ALLOWING FOR SYSTEMIC UPTAKE AND CIRCULATION TO ALL PLANT PARTS; AND C) BROAD-SPECTRUM ACTIVITY THAT TARGETS A WIDE DIVERSITY OF INSECT PESTS.
