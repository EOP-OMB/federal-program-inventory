IT IS THE MOST POPULATED CITY IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA AND THE 8TH MOST POPULOUS CITY IN FLORIDA. THREE-QUARTERS OF FLORIDA'S POPULATION LIVES WITHIN 150 MILES OF CAPE CORAL.\n\nTHE EQUIPMENT PURCHASED WILL IMPROVE THE DETECTION, DOCUMENTATION, AND COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE, INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DRYING CHAMBERS, AND DECREASE CONTAMINATION AND CHAIN OF CUSTODY CONCERNS. ADDING ULTRAVIOLET (UV) AND INFRARED (IR) CAPABILITIES, THE DEPARTMENT WILL REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND PROMOTE THE STANDARDIZATION OF FORENSIC SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, THE DEPARTMENT WILL MODIFY THE FORENSIC LAB, PROVIDING A MORE SECURE ENVIRONMENT, AND REDUCING THE RISK OF CONTAMINATION AND CHAIN OF CUSTODY CONCERNS. DUE TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA COMING INTO THE DEPARTMENT TO BE PROCESSED, A DEDICATED ROOM WITH PROPER VENTILATION WILL BE MODIFIED TO BECOME A DRUG EVIDENCE PROCESSING ROOM. THE DRUG EVIDENCE PROCESSING ROOM AIMS TO MINIMIZE FORENSIC PERSONNEL'S CHALLENGES WHEN HANDLING EVIDENCE SPECIFIC TO OPIOIDS AND SYNTHETIC DRUGS. HAVING LATENT PRINTS IN DRUG CASES WILL GIVE THE STATE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DIRECT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE DRUG DEALERS. \n\nTHE DEPARTMENT IS A DEDICATED LEADER IN FORENSIC ACCREDITATION. THE FORENSIC SCIENCE SERVICES UNIT IS ACCREDITED IN THE FIELD OF FORENSIC SCIENCE INSPECTION AND FRICTION RIDGE THROUGH ANSI-ASQ NATIONAL ACCREDITATION BOARD (ANAB). THE DEPARTMENT WILL ENSURE THAT RELIABLE AND SCIENTIFICALLY VALID EVIDENCE IS USED WHEN EXAMINING, ANALYZING, AND INTERPRETING EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL MATTERS AND PROVIDE REPORTS AND TESTIMONY TO COURTS OF LAW REGARDING SUCH EVIDENCE. FORENSIC PERSONNEL'S JOB IS TO COLLECT, PRESERVE, AND ANALYZE EVIDENCE FOR LAB AND COURT PROCEEDINGS AND TESTIFIES AS AN EXPERT TO THOSE ITEMS AND FINDS. \n\nTHE DEPARTMENT HAS A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL LEVELS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

THERE ARE 138 AUTHORIZED POSITIONS IN THE DIVISION.\n\nIN NOVEMBER 2020, OREGON VOTERS PASSED MEASURE 110, APPROVING HOW THE STATE HANDLES THE USE OF SOME ILLEGAL DRUGS. THIS MEASURE REDUCES PENALTIES FOR DRUG POSSESSION, MAKING OREGON THE FIRST STATE TO DECRIMINALIZE THE PERSONAL POSSESSION OF ILLEGAL DRUGS. MEASURE 110 WENT INTO EFFECT IN FEBRUARY 2021 AND HAS DRAMATICALLY REDUCED BOTH FELONY AND MISDEMEANOR POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES SUBMITTED TO THE OSP CRIME LAB FOR ANALYSIS. WITH THE REDUCTION OF DRUG CHEMISTRY, THE FSD HAS SEEN A STEADY INCREASE OF SUBMISSIONS IN TOXICOLOGY SAMPLES. THE TWO MAIN FACTORS FOR THIS INCREASE IS THE INCREASE OF DRUG USE WHILE OPERATING A VEHICLE, AS WELL AS THE REALLOCATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY RESOURCES FROM POSSESSION CASES TO IMPAIRED DRIVING CASES. THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY INCREASE OF PENDING TOXICOLOGY REQUESTS SINCE FEBRUARY 2021.\n\nTHE FSD IS PROPOSING TO USE GRANT FUNDS FOR OVERTIME TO HELP REDUCE THE BACKLOG AND HELP MAINTAIN 80% OF CASES BE COMPLETED UNDER 30 DAYS. THE FSD IS ALSO PROPOSING TO USE APPROXIMATELY $150,000 OF THE ANTICIPATED AWARDED GRANT FUNDS FOR NATIONAL MEDICAL SERVICES (NMS) TO ANALYZE POST-MORTEM SAMPLES.
