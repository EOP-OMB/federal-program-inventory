SPECIFICALLY, KENAITZE SEEKS TO ENHANCE THE HENU COURT PROGRAM BY INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF PARTICIPATION AND/OR RE-ENTRY SUPPORTS, INCLUDING CLOTHING, HYGIENE, HOUSING, AND TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS; AND EXPANDING THE SUPPLIES AND SERVICES USED FOR CHEMICAL TESTING IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PARTICIPANT ACCOUNTABILITY TO THIS DIVERSIONARY, ALTERNATIVE-TO-INCARCERATION PROGRAM. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE PROPOSED ENHANCEMENTS ADDRESS DRUG COURT STANDARD 6, \u201cCOMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT AND SOCIAL SUPPORTS\u201d, BY ENABLING HENU TO ACCEPT NEW PROGRAM REFERRALS/APPROVALS SO THAT MORE ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE TREATMENT PATHWAYS AND REDUCED SENTENCING OFFERED BY THIS TRIBAL HEALING-TO-WELLNESS COURT PROGRAM. FURTHER, THESE ENHANCEMENTS WILL ENABLE THE HENU PROBATION OFFICER (HPO) TO CONNECT UN\u2019INA WITH THE RANGE OF EXISTING SUPPORT SERVICES OFFERED BY PARALLEL KENAITZE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE, SOCIAL SERVICES, EDUCATION, AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT AMONG OTHERS; AND MOST DIRECTLY SUPPORT CLOTHING, HYGIENE, TRANSPORTATION, AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE NEEDS FOR UP TO FIFTEEN (15) INDIGENT AND/OR RECENTLY INCARCERATED HENU PARTICIPANTS PER YEAR.
