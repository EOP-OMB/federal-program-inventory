ACCORDING TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES (ADHS) AS OF MAY 21, 2021 DATA, SHOWS THERE HAS BEEN 37,188 CONFIRMED CASES AND 838 DEATHS IN YUMA COUNTY SINCE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC.

YCPHSD WILL ESTABLISH A LOCAL CHW COMMUNITY COALITION AIMED TO INFORM AND UNITE CHWS PROVIDING SERVICES AMONG THEIR RESPECTIVE CAPACITIES AND TO ESTABLISH MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FROM SEASONED CHWS.  THROUGH INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS, COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS, AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, THE COALITION WILL ADDRESS THE OVERALL APPROACH TO TRAIN, DEPLOY, AND ENGAGE CHWS FOR COVID-19 RESPONSE, DECREASE HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INCREASE COMMUNITY RESILIENCY.

COMMUNITIES - THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH\u2019S OFFICE OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS PROPOSES MASSACHUSETTS CHWS FOR COVID RESPONSE AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES (MA CCR). IN THIS INITIATIVE, TRAINED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHWS) WILL BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN COMMUNITIES, HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS, AND LOCAL BOARDS OF HEALTH IN 9 COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH COVID-19 INFECTION AND MORTALITY RATES TO ADDRESS THE COVID-19-RELATED NEEDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE UNDERLYING INEQUITIES RESULTING IN UNEQUAL DISEASE BURDEN. TO DO THIS WORK, THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (MDPH) IS APPLYING FOR BOTH COMPONENT B AND C. WITH THE AIM OF DECREASING THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 AND PROMOTING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE, COMPONENT B WILL INTEGRATE CHWS INTO PRIMARY CARE TO SUPPORT PATIENT-CENTERED CARE FOR THOSE AT-RISK FOR OR SUFFERING FROM COVID-19; AND COMPONENT C WILL DEPLOY CHWS IN LOCAL BOARDS OF HEALTH TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS IN UPSTREAM PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS. WHILE EACH COMPONENT CAN STAND ALONE, COMBINED THEY CREATE A BROADER COMMUNITY IMPACT. IN MASSACHUSETTS, LIKE THE NATION, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT POPULATION HEALTH IMPACTS INCLUDING ACUTE COVID-19-RELATED DISEASE, DISRUPTION OF NON-COVID CARE, INCREASED HEALTH-RELATED SOCIAL NEEDS, AND INCREASED MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. THIS BURDEN HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BLACK, INDIGENOUS, LATINX, AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AS OF JULY 2020, BLACK NON-HISPANIC RESIDENTS REPRESENTED 7% OF THE MA POPULATION BUT DOUBLE THE PROPORTION OF COVID-19 CASES (14%); AND HISPANIC RESIDENTS REPRESENTED 12% OF THE MA POPULATION BUT MORE THAN TWICE THE PROPORTION OF CASES (29%). AGE-SPECIFIC DEATH RATES REVEAL THAT RESIDENTS WHO ARE HISPANIC, BLACK NON-HISPANIC, AND OTHER NON-HISPANIC HAVE HIGHER RATES OF DEATH IN EVERY AGE GROUP COMPARED TO RESIDENTS WHO ARE WHITE AND ASIAN NON-HISPANIC. CHWS ARE UNIQUELY EQUIPPED TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS AND BUILD TRUST WITH THE PEOPLE MOST IMPACTED BY COVID-19 DUE TO THEIR SHARED LIVED EXPERIENCE. DUE TO LONG-STANDING EXPERIENCE AND PARTNERSHIPS, MDPH CAN QUICKLY DEPLOY TRAINED CHWS IN PRIMARY CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SETTINGS TO ENGAGE THE INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. FOR COMPONENT B, CHWS WILL WORK ALONGSIDE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO ADDRESS PATIENTS\u2019 COVID-19 NEEDS WHILE ALSO FOCUSING ON REENGAGING PEOPLE IN PRIMARY CARE, HELPING NAVIGATE AND COORDINATE CARE, SUPPORT VACCINATION, AND ADDRESSING PATIENTS\u2019 HEALTH-RELATED SOCIAL NEEDS. MA CCR CHWS WILL REACH 7,000 PATIENTS OVER 3 YEARS. FOR COMPONENT C, CHWS, WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY THE PRIMARY CARE SITE, WILL BE EMBEDDED IN THEIR LOCAL BOARDS OF HEALTH TO FOCUS ON ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY IN ASSESSING AND ADDRESSING THE UPSTREAM CAUSES OF POOR HEALTH. THE CHWS WILL WORK ALONGSIDE COMMUNITY COALITIONS TO ENSURE THE LOCAL COALITIONS CENTER THEIR WORK ON THE HEALTH EQUITY NEEDS OF THE GROUPS MOST IMPACTED BY COVID-19. MA CCR WILL MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE 1,500 RESIDENTS AND CHANGE AT LEAST 9 POLICIES RELATED TO HEALTH EQUITY. MUNICIPAL POLICY CHANGES WILL REACH THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THE PROPOSAL BUILDS ON MDPH\u2019S EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE AND NETWORK OF PARTNERS AND HAS STRONG SUPPORT FROM STATE AGENCY LEADERSHIP, ENSURING STRONG ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE\u2019S COVID-19 VACCINATION AND MITIGATION EFFORTS. MASSACHUSETTS HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PROMOTING AND SUPPORTING THE PROFESSION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHWS) AS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO HAVE AN OFFICE OF CHWS IN ITS STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE FIRST STATE TO HAVE CREDENTIALING OF CHWS THROUGH A PROFESSIONAL BOARD CERTIFICATION PROCESS. FOR OVER 40 YEARS, MDPH HAS WORKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CHWS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR CHW INITIATIVES, PROMOTE POLICIES THAT BUILD THE WORKFORCE, SUPPORT CORE COMPETENCY TRAINING OF CHWS, AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS EMPLOYING CHWS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations":
