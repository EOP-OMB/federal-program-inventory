UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS WYOMING.  THE WYOMING STATE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM (WYSLRP) WILL EXPAND AND ENHANCE THE ORH\u2019S CURRENT ACTIVITIES WHICH SUPPORT THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE STATE BY PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL LOAN REPAYMENT TO PRIMARY CARE, DENTAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSAS). THE WYSLRP WILL PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF FIVE (5) LOAN REPAYMENT AWARDS OF UP TO $50,000 TO ELIGIBLE PROVIDERS DURING EACH YEAR OF THE FOUR (4) YEAR PROJECT PERIOD.  WYOMING SUFFERS FROM A SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY MEDICAL, DENTAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS.  THE ENTIRE STATE IS DESIGNATED AS A MENTAL HEALTH HPSA, NINETY-ONE PERCENT (91%) OF WYOMING\u2019S COUNTIES HAVE SOME FORM OF PRIMARY CARE HPSA DESIGNATION, AND SEVENTY PERCENT (70%) HAVE SOME FORM OF DENTAL HPSA DESIGNATION.  HIGH MEDICAL MALPRACTICE RATES, HIGH NUMBERS OF UNINSURED PATIENTS, LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES, A RAPIDLY AGING POPULATION, AND CONTINUING DIFFICULTIES WITH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS HAVE COMBINED TO CREATE A CRISIS IN WYOMING.  IN ADDITION, RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS STATEWIDE HAS BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, PARTICULARLY FOR NURSING.  ACCORDING TO THE DECEMBER 31, 2021, DESIGNATED HPSA QUARTERLY SUMMARY FROM THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (HRSA), WYOMING NEEDS AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY-FOUR (24) FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT PRIMARY CARE PHYSIC IANS, EIGHT (8) FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT DENTISTS, AND TWENTY-EIGHT (28) FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT PSYCHIATRISTS TO ELIMINATE ALL HPSAS IN THE STATE.  THESE FACTORS HAVE RESULTED IN A LACK OF ACCESS FOR THE UNINSURED AND PUBLICLY INSURED DUE TO CAPS PLACED BY PROVIDERS ON THE PROPORTION OF THESE CLIENTS THEY WILL ACCEPT INTO THEIR PRACTICES AND SOME AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE A LACK OF ACCESS TO PRIMARY MEDICAL, DENTAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REGARDLESS OF PAYER.      LOAN REPAYMENT BENEFITS ARE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN A PROVIDER\u2019S DECISION TO PRACTICE IN WYOMING AS THEY OFFSET THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS CREATED BY THE HIGH MEDICAL MALPRACTICE RATES, LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES, AND HIGH NUMBERS OF UNINSURED PATIENTS IN WYOMING\u2019S UNDERSERVED AREAS, AND THE WYSLRP WILL BE ONE COMPONENT OF A MULTI-FACETED APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION INCENTIVES FOR WYOMING PROVIDERS.  BY PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL LOAN REPAYMENT TO THOSE PROVIDERS PRACTICING IN WYOMING\u2019S UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES, WYSLRP WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT THE OVERALL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THE POPULATION THROUGH INCREASED RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AND ACCESS TO PRIMARY MEDICAL, DENTAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WY", "COVID-19 Obligations": 555624.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d4946d71-8e36-7b67-ecf3-0a3cc9cbd7ec-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H5646833_7526"}, {"internal_id": 151589556, "Award ID": "H5646832", "Award Amount": 1338156.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-19", "CFDA Number": "93.165", "Description": "GRANTS TO STATES FOR LOAN REPAYMENT - FUNDING OPPORTUNITY TITLE\tU.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS STATE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM ORGANIZATION\tU.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, PRIMARY CARE OFFICE APPLICANT NAME\tBERLINA WALLACE-BERUBE, MACP, MED ADDRESS\t3500 ESTATE RICHMOND, CHRISTIANSTED, VI 00820 PHONE NUMBERS\t(340)718-1311 EXT. 3755  EMAIL ADDRESS\tBERLINA.WALLACE-BERUBE@DOH.VI.GOV WEBSITE ADDRESS\tHTTP://WWW.DOH.VI.GOV  PROJECT ABSTRACT CURRENTLY, THE USVI DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE BUREAU OF HEALTH WORKFORCE GRANT TO STATES PROGRAM.

THE USVI-SLRP IS A VITAL RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL THAT WILL FACILITATE A BROADER DISTRIBUTION OF SKILLED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN THE USVI. ACCORDING TO THE 2020 CENSUS, THE USVI HAS A POPULATION OF 87,146 AND AN ESTIMATED TOTAL OF 57,257 HOUSEHOLD UNITS WITH 25,470 ON ST. CROIX, 28,142 ON ST. THOMAS, AND 3,645 ON ST. JOHN. APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE USVI POPULATION LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE, COMPARED TO 16% NATIONWIDE. THE ENTIRE USVI IS A HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA) WITH PRIMARY CARE, DENTAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH DESIGNATIONS. IN 2016, THE UNINSURED RATE IN THE USVI WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE UNINSURED RATE IN THE US (30% COMPARED TO 12%). ALSO IN 2016, ABOUT 40% OF THE POPULATION WAS ON SOME FORM OF PUBLIC INSURANCE WITH 23% ENROLLED IN MEDICAID AND 17% RECEIVING MEDICARE BENEFITS.  THE AGE-ADJUSTED MORTALITY FOR DIABETES IN THE USVI (42.3 PER 100,000) IS OVER DOUBLE THAT OF THE UNITED STATES (20.8 PER 100,000). DEATHS DUE TO HYPERTENSION, RENAL HYPERTENSION, AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE ARE ALSO EXTREMELY HIGH, RANGING FROM 21.5 \u2013 33.4 PER 100,000.

THE SLRP PROGRAM AIMS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL AWARDS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO COMMIT TO WORKING IN AN UNDERSERVED AREA FOR THREE YEARS.  THE EXPECTED PROGRAM OUTCOME IS TO MAKE SLRP AWARDS TO 61 HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DURING THE FOUR-YEAR GRANT PERIOD 2022-2026; EACH PROVIDER WILL SIGN A CONTRACT TO PRACTICE IN AN UNDERSERVED RURAL OR URBAN HPSA FOR THREE YEARS, THEREBY HELPING TO ACHIEVE OUR PROGRAM GOAL.

IN DECEMBER 2021,THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF HEALTH WORKFORCE FOUND THAT WISCONSIN NEEDS OVER 440 ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE ALL HPSAS IN THE STATE.  WISCONSIN HAS AN ESPECIALLY GREAT NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS.  ACCORDING TO BUREAU DATA, OVER 65% OF THE STATE\u2019S NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IS UNMET, LEAVING 2 \u00bc MILLION RESIDENTS WITHOUT ACCESS TO CARE.

IN ADDITION, THESE PROVIDERS\u2019 APPLICATIONS WILL BE GIVEN MORE WEIGHT WHEN MAKING AWARD DECISIONS.  WORH WILL SEEK TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE STATE BY FOCUSING SLRP PROMOTION ON NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL CLINICS AND RURAL PRACTICE SITES, WITH A GOAL OF RECRUITING PROVIDERS TO THESE COMMUNITIES.

TO THIS END, THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (DPH) IS SUBMITTING THIS APPLICATION TO THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (HRSA) TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING SHORT AND LONG-TERM GOALS: 1) DEVELOP AND ESTABLISH A STATE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM IN CONNECTICUT; 2) RECRUIT AND RETAIN PROVIDERS TO SUSTAIN A GROWING PRIMARY HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE WORKING IN A HPSA WITHIN CONNECTICUT; AND 3) ENCOURAGE STATE LEVEL PARTNERSHIP/COOPERATION WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS/MEET STATE\u2019S HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE NEEDS. THE LONG-TERM GOALS OF CONNECTICUT\u2019S SLRP INCLUDE INCREASING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES, DECREASING HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES, AND IMPROVING OVERALL HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES IN HPSA COMMUNITIES/POPULATIONS.  WITH A POPULATION OF JUST OVER 3.5 MILLION PEOPLE, CONNECTICUT IS ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST STATES IN THE COUNTRY. DESPITE ITS WEALTH, THERE ARE GREAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES, WITH 10% OF THE POPULATION LIVING IN POVERTY AND THE STATE RANKING THIRD AMONG ALL STATES FOR INCOME INEQUALITY.  FURTHERMORE, IN THE LARGEST CITIES IN CONNECTICUT, BRIDGEPORT, HARTFORD, AND NEW HAVEN, MORE THAN 20% OF HOUSEHOLDS LIVE IN POVERTY AND HAVE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES THAT ARE CLOSE TO HALF THAT OF THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN INCOME. INCOME DISPARITIES EXIST BY RACE AND ETHNICITY AND GEOGRAPHY, INCLUDING IN RURAL AREAS AND ESPECIALLY FOR HISPANIC AND BLACK PEOPLE . THE CT PRIMARY CARE NEEDS ASSESSMENT IDEN TIFIED AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR PRIMARY CARE DUE TO THE AGING POPULATION AND THE INCREASED NUMBER OF INSURED INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MEDICAID EXPANSION. THIS FINDING IS CONSISTENT WITH TREND ANALYSIS AND DATA FROM HRSA, WHICH PROJECTS A SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN CONNECTICUT AS DEMAND FOR CARE INCREASES. HRSA DATA ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE ONLY MEETS 45% OF THE DEMAND AND THAT THIS TREND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE UNTIL 2030. ADDITIONAL DATA CITED FROM THE ROBERT GRAHAM CENTER INDICATED THAT BY 2023 CONNECTICUT WILL NEED 15% MORE PHYSICIANS TO MEET THE DEMAND.  TO RELIEVE SOME OF THE BURDEN THIS SHORTAGE HAS PLACED ON OUR COMMUNITIES, DPH IS PROPOSING THIS SLRP TO INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS WHO ARE BEGINNING THEIR CAREERS IN HEALTH CARE TO EITHER STAY IN CONNECTICUT AFTER THEIR TRAINING OR TO MOVE TO CONNECTICUT FROM OTHER STATES AND TO WORK IN HIGH NEED AREAS.  PROVIDERS ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM WILL RECEIVE PAYMENTS DIRECTED TO THEIR STUDENT LOANS IN EXCHANGE FOR PRACTICING PRIMARY CARE IN A HPSA FOR A MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS. AS A RESULT, THIS PROGRAM HELPS MEETING THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS IN HPSA\u2019S AND REINFORCES THE STATE\u2019S SAFETY NETWORK SERVICE DELIVERY.

BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE 40-MINUTE TRAVEL ANALYSIS OF  CLAIMS DATA PROVIDED BY THE MAINE HEALTH DATA ORGANIZATION, RHPCP FOUND THAT A DISPARITY OF ACCESS FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT EXISTS FOR CLIENTS THAT RELY ON MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT. THE CURRENT FUNDING OPPORTUNITY WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL TOOL TO ADDRESS HRSA\u2019S CLINICAL PRIORITY OF IMPROVING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND TO TARGET A SEGMENT OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE THAT IS CURRENTLY WITHOUT WORKFORCE PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES AT THE STATE LEVEL.  ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN PLANNED AND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. ONCE FUNDING HAS BEEN DETERMINED, THE RHPCP WILL COLLABORATE WITH OUR PARTNERS TO PROMOTE THE PROGRAM, INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SAFETY NET, MONITOR TRENDS TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES, OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND INCENTIVIZE CLINICIANS TO SERVE RURAL, UNDERSERVED OR VULNERABLE PATIENTS IN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS.   ACTIVITIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PROCESSING APPLICATIONS, EXECUTING CONTRACTS, SCHEDULING ORIENTATIONS AND AWARDING PAYMENTS. REPORTS WILL BE COMPLETED, AND SURVEYS WILL BE COLLECTED FROM THE PROVIDERS TO MEASURE SATISFACTION AND EVALUATE PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS. CLINICIANS WHO CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM AGREE TO SERVE FOR A MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS. A ONE-YEAR CONTINUING CONTRACT WILL BE OFFERED AS FUNDS ALLOW. ALL RELEVANT HRSA POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WILL BE FOLLOWED IN ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO HPSA, MAXIMUM AWARD AMOUNTS ($25,000 PER YEAR) AND SLIDING FEE AND MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS.

THE  CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION (HCAI) PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT, ADMINISTERS THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM (SLRP).  SLRP INCREASES THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE, DENTAL, AND MENTAL/BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS PRACTICING IN FEDERALLY DESIGNATED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSA) THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.  SINCE 1991, CALIFORNIA SLRP HAS PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY $58 MILLION IN LOAN REPAYMENT SUPPORT TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN EXCHANGE FOR WORKING IN HPSAS.  CALIFORNIA FACES A SHORTFALL OF PROVIDERS WITH ITS INCREASING POPULATION. THE EXPANSION OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE ACT (ACA) ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NEED FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE.  THE SLRP GRANT ALLOWS HCAI TO EXPAND THE HEALTHCARE SAFETY NET, ENABLING THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE GREATEST NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE, QUALITY HEALTH CARE.  THE FOLLOWING ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF SLRP: -\tPROVIDE FUNDING TO APPROXIMATELY 120 CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT PROVIDERS PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE IN CALIFORNIA HPSAS OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. -\tRECRUIT AND RETAIN HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS IN HPSAS.

YET, AN AGING POPULATION AND INCREASING NATIONAL COMPETITION FOR HIGHLY TRAINED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS POINTS TOWARD A LOOMING CRISIS IN ACCESS TO CARE IN VERMONT.   THIS HAS PUT AN INCREDIBLE DEMAND ON THE LIMITED RESOURCES OF OUR STATE FUNDED EDUCATIONAL LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM (ELR) INCENTIVES ADMINISTERED BY THE AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER (AHEC) PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT\u2019S LARNER COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, TO FUND RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION INCENTIVES FOR FQHCS, RHCS AND PRIVATE PRIMARY CARE AND DENTAL PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.  IN THIS CYCLE OF SLRP THE VERMONT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WILL CONTINUE ITS LONG-STANDING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AHEC PROGRAM OFFICE TO ADMINISTER BOTH THE ELR AND SLRP ON SIMILAR TERMS. AHEC WILL PUBLICIZE BOTH PROGRAMS, REVIEW APPLICATIONS, WRITE AWARD CONTRACTS WITH PROVIDERS, MONITOR COMPLIANCE AND REPORT REGULARLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WILL SUBMIT PERIODIC REPORTS AND CONTINUATION APPLICATIONS TO HRSA AS REQUIRED.  THIS CYCLE WE ARE REQUESTING AN INCREASED BUDGET BASED ON THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE APPLICATIONS WE RECEIVE AND ARE HISTORICALLY UNABLE TO FUND.

WE WILL DO THIS BY PROVIDING LOAN REPAYMENT AWARDS OF $2,000 ($12,500 SLRP + $12,500 NON-FEDERAL) TO UP TO 55 PROVIDERS EACH YEAR TO WORK IN ONE OF OUR HPSAS.  WE WILL PRIORITIZE INCENTIVES TO OUR HIGHEST NEEDS OF GENERAL DENTISTRY, PSYCHIATRY AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE AND FAMILY PRACTICE.
