OUR LARGEST SERVICE IS OUR GIRL CONNECT PROGRAM ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES (MOST OF THEM TITLE 1). THROUGH GIRL CONNECT, WE ARE GIVING GIRLS A STRONG BELIEF IN THEMSELVES (SELF-EFFICACY), WHICH HAS AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ON ACADEMIC SUCCESS, FUTURE CAREER ACHIEVEMENT, AND LIFTING WOMEN AND GIRLS (AND THEREBY MORE OF SOCIETY OVERALL) OUT OF POVERTY. \n\nTHE VISTA PROJECT ALIGNS WITH THE EDUCATION PRIORITY AREA AND WOULD DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO \"K-12 SUCCESS IN STUDENT EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES IN LOW-ACHIEVING SCHOOLS.\" GIRL CONNECT PROGRAMMING SUPPORTS GIRLS IN INCREASED POSITIVE SCHOOL FUNCTIONING AND DECREASED DISCIPLINARY REFERRALS.

WE HAVE LEANED INTO WHAT WE DO BEST AND CONVERTED OUR SERVICES TO REACH GIRLS NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE. \n \nACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH, HIGH STRESS TIMES LIKE COVID-19 PUTS EXTRA PRESSURE ON FAMILIES, AND OUR COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE INCREASED RATES OF ALCOHOLISM, DRUG USE, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE.

COVID-19 EXACERBATES ALL THE ILLNESS, HOMELESSNESS, ARREST, AND TRAUMA THAT COMES WITH RUNNING AWAY. ADDITIONALLY, ACCORDING TO THE FBI, GIRLS ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS THEY ARE SPENDING MORE TIME ONLINE, FEELING A NEED FOR CONNECTION AS A RESULT OF SHELTERING-IN-PLACE DURING THIS PANDEMIC.\n \nEVEN IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, OUR GIRLS ARE IN NEED OF A HEALTHY CONNECTION OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOMES TO COMBAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY (A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR FOR GIRLS OF ANY BACKGROUND.)

THE YEAR 3 VISTA MEMBER SINGLEHANDEDLY PLANNED AND ORGANIZED THE VERY FIRST VISTA MEMBERS GATHERING OF VISTA MEMBERS FROM MASSACHUSETTS FOR VISTA MEMBERS IN THE AREA TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES AND TO NETWORK. \n\nIN THE UPCOMING PROJECT YEAR, UPON THE APPROVAL OF THE EXTENSION OF THE VISTA PROJECT, THE TEAM WILL FOCUS ON TACKLING HURDLES THAT CROPPED UP. ONE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE THAT CAME UP IN PROJECT YEAR 3 WAS THE EXPIRATION OF GRANT FUNDING WHICH WAS SPONSORING THE LOGISTICS COST OF THE DELIVERY AND HEALTH/WELLNESS WORKSHOPS AND THEREBY REDUCED BHA'S RESIDENTS' ACCESS TO HEALTH/WELLNESS INFORMATION. COUPLED WITH THE CONSTANT CHALLENGES IN SECURING SPONSORSHIP, YEAR 4 VISTA MEMBER WILL FOCUS SPECIFICALLY IN RE-ESTABLISHING THESE LOST RESOURCES THROUGH GRANT WRITING. \n\nIN ADDITION, IN PROJECT YEAR 4, THE PROJECT TEAM WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE TARGETED NUMBER OF RESIDENTS SERVED BY THE PROJECT. THUS IN THE TEAM WILL ENGAGE 1200 BHA RESIDENTS VARIOUS BHA PUBLIC HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS, OF WHOM MORE THAN 50% ARE LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING WITH THE PREDOMINANT LANGUAGES BEING SPANISH, CHINESE, HAITIAN CREOLE, AND CAPE VERDEAN.

PROJECT AMISTAD PROPOSES TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH 3 VISTA MEMBERS, WHICH INCLUDES ONE COST SHARE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO THE SUSTAINABILITY TO THE VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT PROGRAM (VRP), WHILE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN A FUND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE VISTA'S WILL CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THE VRP, THEREFORE BUILDING A SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW THE PROCESS OF ADVOCATING AND MENTORING VETERANS, THE ELDERLY AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES TO ENSURE THEY HAVE ALL SERVICES THEY ARE ENTITLED TO.  VETERANS ARE REQUIRED TO CHECK IN WITH THE VETERAN'S ASSOCIATION ANNUALLY TO CONTINUE RECEIVING SERVICES. WHEN THIS HAS LAPSED (DUE TO MISINFORMATION, IGNORANCE REGARDING REQUIREMENTS, OR INDIGENCE AND THE LOSS OF ALL PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION), THE DOCUMENTS VERIFYING PRIOR SERVICE ARE ESSENTIAL IN THE PROCESS OF REINSTATING THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES.  OUR CONCERN IS THAT MOST OF OUR VETERANS THAT ARE INDIGENT AND/OR HOMELESS HAVE LIMITED AWARENESS OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE VISTAS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES AND SYSTEMS THEREBY IMPROVING THE LIVES OF ALL THAT WE SERVE AT PROJECT AMISTAD. THE VRP WILL THEN SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS. THE GUARDIANSHIP PROGRAM HAS APPROXIMATELY 400 INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED AS INDIGENT AND INCAPACITATED AND NOT ABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES. THE COUNTY OF EL PASO PROBATE COURT CONTRACTS WITH PROJECT AMISTAD TO ENSURE THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE PROFESSIONAL GUARDIANS THAT CAN ADVOCATE FOR THEIR DAILY NEEDS. HAVING VOLUNTEERS FOR THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT WITHIN A VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION. MANY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE VULNERABLE DUE TO LACK OF TRANSPORTATION, THE INABILITY TO PAY FOR THEIR MEDICATIONS DUE TO POVERTY, ACCESS TO THEIR FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS POST-DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL, LIVING ARRANGEMENTS, ETC. BUILDING UPON THE VOLUNTEER AND INTERN PROGRAM WILL PROVE TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO ALL INVOLVED. ANOTHER COMPONENT TO PROJECT AMISTAD IS THE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. TRANSPORTATION IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT THROUGH VARIOUS ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST NEEDS THAT MANY OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE. MANY OF THE CLIENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES ARE VERY VULNERABLE TO THEIR DISABILITY OR HEALTH DISPARITIES. BEING ABLE TO BUILD A POOL OF VOLUNTEERS THAT CAN ASSIST OUR CLIENTS ON THE BUS, WOULD ALSO BE BENEFICIAL. MANY OF THE CLIENTS COME FROM THEIR DIALYSIS APPOINTMENTS, THEREFORE HAVING A VOLUNTEER ON THE BUS WOULD ASSIST THE DRIVER IN KNOWING UP TO DATE INFORMATION REGARDING HOW THE CLIENTS ARE DOING. IN ALL THE AFOREMENTIONED PROGRAMS, MANY OF OUR VOLUNTEERS ARE BEING SERVED. THIS WOULD INCLUDE WORKING WITH THE VOLUNTEERS AND INTERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RECRUITED TO ENSURE THE MISSION IS MET, WHICH IS TO SERVE AND ADVOCATE FOR VETERANS, ELDERLY, PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND PERSONS AT RISK, THEREFORE, IMPROVING THEIR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. THE VISTAS WILL CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE VRP TO ALL PROGRAMMATIC ASPECTS OF VOLUNTEERISM WITH THE AGENCY AND ASSIST WITH THE PLANNING OF VARIOUS FUNCTIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE INDIGENT, ELDERLY AND/OR HAVE A DISABILITY THEREFORE THE 3 REQUESTED VISTAS OVER A 12 MONTH TIME SPAN WILL ULTIMATELY STRENGTHEN A COMMUNITY THAT IS RIDDLED WITH LESS OPPORTUNITIES. WITH THE VETERAN'S IDENTITY PROJECT (VIP), ALL OF THOSE REFERRED TO PA WILL BE VETTED THROUGH APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS TO VALIDATE THEIR STATUS AS PRIOR SERVICE MEMBERS, AND THEN AIDED IN RE-ESTABLISHING THAT ASPECT OF THEIR IDENTITY VIA REGENERATION OF THE DOCUMENTS NEEDED TO PROVE TIME IN SERVICE. WITH SUCH VALIDATION, VETERANS CAN THEN REGISTER WITH THE LOCAL VA TO RE-ESTABLISH THEIR ACCESS TO SUPPORT SERVICES.

PROVIDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT, INCLUDING THE PROJECT GOAL(S) AS WELL AS AN OVERVIEW OF THE ACTIVITIES THE REQUESTED VISTAS AND LEADERS WILL PERFORM.\n\nTHE WEST PHILADELPHIA PROMISE ZONE INITIATIVE IS A FEDERALLY-DESIGNATED, PLACE-BASED EFFORT TO ASSIST A TWO SQUARE MILE AREA OF PHILADELPHIA WHERE RESIDENTS EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF POVERTY. THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OF COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT AND OPPORTUNITY (CEO) LEADS A COLLECTIVE IMPACT MODEL TO COORDINATE THE EFFORTS OF ROUGHLY 100 PARTNERS, WHICH INCLUDE NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS, CITY AGENCIES, NON-PROFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS. THESE PARTNERS COLLABORATE IN COMMITTEES THAT ADVANCE STRATEGIES IN ONE OF SIX AREAS: WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, HEALTH AND WELLNESS, EDUCATION, PUBLIC SAFETY, AND HOUSING. THE AMERICORPS VISTAS ASSIGNED TO THE WEST PHILADELPHIA PROMISE ZONE STAFF THESE COMMITTEES, BUILDING AND IMPROVING SYSTEMS FOR CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL COMMUNICATION, COLLABORATION, DATA SHARING, AND RESIDENT ENGAGEMENT. FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS, VISTAS HAVE BUILT, MONITORED, AND IMPROVED THE ORGANIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NEEDED TO APPROACH A PAN-DISCIPLINARY PROBLEM LIKE POVERTY, AND IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PRIORITIES WHICH CAN BE IMPLEMENTED.  WHILE SOME OF THIS WORK WILL CONTINUE IN FUTURE YEARS, VISTAS WILL BEGIN PLAYING A STRONGER ROLE IN ENSURING THE ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE USED ARE SUSTAINABLE. THIS WILL ENTAIL ?RIGHT-SIZING? SOME OF THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT IN A MANNER THAT ENABLES THEIR TRANSFER TO OTHER PARTNERS INVOLVED IN THE PROMISE ZONE INITIATIVE. WHILE CEO WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY ITS ROLE AS LEAD AGENCY, THE LONGEVITY OF THIS WORK WILL REQUIRE INCREASING OWNERSHIP BY IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS. VISTAS WILL, STARTING IN 2017, HELP TO FACILITATE THIS SHARED OWNERSHIP. \n\n2. HOW MANY VISTAS AND LEADERS ARE YOU REQUESTING?\n \nWE ARE REQUESTING 5 VISTAS.  \n \n3. WHAT IS THE ESTIMATE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT?\n \nTHE DESIGNATION IS INTENDED TO LAST THROUGH 2024. THE WORK THAT VISTAS WILL PROVIDE IN HELPING TO ENSURE THE LONGEVITY OF THE COLLABORATIVE WORK OF THE PROMISE ZONE WILL TAKE TWO TO THREE YEARS. \n \n4. BRIEFLY DESCRIBE YOUR ORGANIZATION'S MISSION, HISTORY, AND THE BENEFICIARIES OF YOUR ORGANIZATION'S PROGRAMS.\n\nOUR CITY'S POVERTY RATE NOW STANDS AT 26.4%, AND THOSE IN POVERTY INCLUDE 39% OF OUR CHILDREN, AND 17% OF OUR SENIORS. THE POVERTY RATE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS, DISABLED PHILADELPHIANS AND FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS HOVERS AROUND 40% OR GREATER.  \n\nMAYOR MICHAEL NUTTER RECOGNIZED THAT THE SCALE OF POVERTY IN PHILADELPHIA REQUIRES COLLECTIVE ACTION OF AN EQUAL SCALE. THERE IS NO SINGLE CAUSE OF POVERTY, SO MYRIAD CITY AGENCIES AND NONPROFITS WORKING IN SILOS COULD HOPE ONLY TO HAVE ISOLATED IMPACT ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE OR SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION AFFECTED BY POVERTY.
