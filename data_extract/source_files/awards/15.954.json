THIS WORK WILL BUILD OFF A TRAIL PLANNING STUDY COMPLETED IN 2020SUMMARY OF PROJECT SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES:THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TASK AGREEMENT IS TO COLLABORATE ON DATA COLLECTION, EARLY STUDIES, PRELIMINARY PLANNING, FOR THE MIRAMONTES TRAIL AT PHLEGER ESTATE. THIS PROJECT WILL ENABLE THE PARK TO REQUEST FUNDS FOR FUTURE STAGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNFUNDED UNTIL THERE IS A PROPOSED PROJECT PLAN. THE 2020 TRAIL PLANNING STUDY RECOMMENDS RE-ALIGNING THREE SEGMENTS OF THE MIRAMONTES TRAIL TOTALING APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF MILE. THIS INCLUDES RE-ROUTING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY SEGMENT 150-200 FEET UPSLOPE TO AVOID AN ACTIVE SLIDE, REPLACING AN EXISTING BRIDGE TO A NEW LOCATION OUTSIDE OF A SEASONAL CREEK CHANNEL, AND RELOCATING A PORTION OF EXISTING TRAIL UPSLOPE TO AVOID FUTURE CREEK EROSION. THIS PROJECT WOULD COMPLETE BACKGROUND STUDIES, CREATE A SUGGESTED PREMILINARY TRAIL ALIGNMENT WITH ALTERNATIVES AND PHASING, MAP EXISTING RESOURCES AND PROPOSED RAIL ALIGNMENTS, INITIATE COMPLIANCE, AND MANAGE THE PARK INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM. THE PROJECT PLANNING WOULD CONSIDER RESTORATION PLANS FOR THE EXISTING TRAIL CORRIDOR.PERFORMANCE GOALS INCLUDING MILESTONES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES:TO SUPPORT THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE IN DOCUMENTING NATURAL, CULTURAL, AND VISITOR ACCESS INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INFORMED DECISION-MAKING ABOUT FUTURE TRAIL DESIGN AND ALIGNMENT. BACKGROUND DATA COLLECTION AND PRE-PLANNING WORK WITH GGNPC STAFF WILL ALL HELP INFORM LONGER TERM DESIGN AND ENGINEERING EFFORTS. THE GGNPC FACILITATOR AND PROJECT MANAGER WILL WORK WITH PARK STAFF TO HELP CLARIFY THE PROJECT GOALS AND LONG TERM PLANS FOR THIS AREA. THIS EFFORT WILL ENABLE THE PARK TO REQUEST FUNDS FOR FUTURE STAGES (DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION) THAT WILL GO THROUGH CONTRACTING PROCESSES, AND CURRENTLY UNFUNDED UNTIL THERE IS A PROPOSED PROJECT PLAN.
