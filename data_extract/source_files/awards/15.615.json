THE LIMITING FACTORS ON THE COASTAL POPULATION IN OREGON INCLUDE CHANGES AND LOSS OF HABITAT, INCREASED HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND DISTURBANCE, INCREASED PREDATION DUE TO HUMAN CAUSED CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT, AND INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE STATUS AND ECOLOGY OF THE SPECIES.STATE MANAGEMENT AND RECOVERY ACTIONS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN SINCE THE LATE 1970 S, INITIALLY ORIENTED TOWARD REDUCING RECREATIONAL IMPACTS ON AREAS USES BY PLOVERS. SINCE 1990, RECOVERY EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXTENDED TO NEST AND BROOD PROTECTION, EXTENSIVE HABITAT RESTORATION, DIRECTED PREDATOR MANAGEMENT, AND PUBLIC OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AS OUTLINED IN THE RECOVERY PLAN (LAUTEN ET AL. 2021, USFWS 2007).

THE WESTERN YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO (COCCYZUS AMERICANUS) IS A NEOTROPICAL MIGRANT THAT WINTERS IN SOUTH AMERICA AND BREEDS IN RIPARIAN WOODLANDS IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA. THE CUCKOO HAS DECLINED FROM MUCH OF ITS HISTORIC RANGE IN THE WESTERN U.S., AND THESE DECLINES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO PESTICIDE USE, LOSS OF RIPARIAN HABITAT IN NESTING AREAS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF FRAGMENTATION, INUNDATION BY RESERVOIRS, STREAM CHANNELIZATION, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. THIS SPECIES IS ELUSIVE, SECRETIVE, AND OFTEN EXHIBITS ERUPTIVE BREEDING BEHAVIOR, ALL OF WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DETECT, DOCUMENT NESTING ACTIVITY, OR ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE TREND OF CUCKOO OCCURRENCE AND BREEDING IN NEVADA. LIKEWISE, THE YUMA RIDGWAY S RAIL (RALLUS OBSOLETUS YUMANENSIS-FORMERLY YUMA CLAPPER RAIL) A SECRETIVE, FRESHWATER MARSH-OBLIGATE, WAS LISTED AS ENDANGERED IN 1967 BY THE FWS, AND IS ALSO STATE PROTECTED ENDANGERED IN NEVADA. HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, STREAM CHANNELIZATION AND DREDGING, WATER FLOW AND FLOOD CONTROL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, AND DRAINING AND DRYING OF WETLANDS ARE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE DEGRADATION OF HABITAT THAT HAS LED TO RAIL POPULATION DECLINES. ANOTHER SPECIES THAT THIS EFFORT COULD POTENTIALLY OBSERVE IS THE SOUTHWESTERN WILLOW FLYCATCHER (EMPIDONAX TRAILLII EXTIMUS  HEREAFTER FLYCATCHER). THE FLYCATCHER WAS LISTED AS ENDANGERED UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT (ESA) IN FEBRUARY OF 1995 (USFWS 1995). THE FLYCATCHER BREEDS IN DENSE RIPARIAN HABITAT, AND THEIR RECENT POPULATION DECLINES HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE LOSS, FRAGMENTATION, ALTERATION AND OR DEGRADATION OF BREEDING HABITAT, BROOD PARASITISM BY BROWN-HEADED COWBIRDS (MOLOTHRUS ATER), NEST PREDATION, TAMARISK (TAMRIXAPHYLLA) DEFOLIATION DUE TO THE TAMARISK BEETLE (DIORHABDA SPP.), AND LOSS OF WINTERING HABITAT.

HUMAN DISTURBANCE OF MATERNITY CAVES AND HIBERNACULA IS A SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTOR TO THE HISTORIC AND PRESENT POPULATION DECLINES OF BATS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND THIS APPEARS TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE POPULATION DECLINES FOR OBLIGATE CAVE-DWELLING SPECIES LIKE THE OZARK BIG-EARED BAT (CORYNORHINUS TOWNSENDII INGENS) AND GRAY BAT (MYOTIS GRISESCENS). LOW REPRODUCTIVE RATES, LONG GENERATION TIMES AND CONCENTRATED POPULATIONS INHABITING A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CAVES, MAKE THESE BAT POPULATIONS ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO HUMAN DISTURBANCE AND SLOW TO RECOVER FROM THESE DISTURBANCES. THE MAJORITY OF CAVES KNOWN TO BE IMPORTANT TO OZARK BIG-EARED AND GRAY BATS OCCUR ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. SOME OF THESE ARE WELL PROTECTED BY THEIR OWNERS; HOWEVER, SOME ARE NOT AND EXPERIENCE PERIODIC HUMAN ENTRY OR DISTURBANCE. THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CAVE PROTECTION PLANS ARE NEEDED FOR SPECIFIC CAVES TO PROTECT THE REMAINING MATERNITY COLONIES AND HIBERNACULA. TWO PROTECTION TECHNIQUES VIEWED AS EFFICIENT METHODS OF DETERRING HUMAN DISTURBANCE WITHIN CAVES ARE 1) THE CONSTRUCTION OF CAMOUFLAGED FENCING AROUND CAVE ENTRANCES AND 2) THE CONSTRUCTION OF INTERNAL GATES OR GRILLS WITHIN CAVE PASSAGES.OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN PROTECTING GRAY BAT MATERNITY CAVES AND BOTH MATERNITY CAVES AND HIBERNACULA FOR THE OZARK BIG-EARED BAT. TO DATE, TWENTY- FOUR BIOLOGICALLY SIGNIFICANT CAVES, SOME WITH MULTIPLE ENTRANCES, HAVE BEEN GATED IN THE OKLAHOMA OZARKS. ALL OF THESE CAVES ARE MONITORED PERIODICALLY TO EVALUATE THEIR USE BY ENDANGERED BAT POPULATIONS. AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS PROJECT IS THE MONITORING OF BAT COLONIES AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION OF GATE/GRILL STRUCTURES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS AND TO DOCUMENT THE POPULATION RESPONSE OF THE BAT COLONIES WITHIN EACH CAVE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A NEED TO CONDUCT BIOLOGICAL SURVEYS WITHIN OTHER CAVES IN THE OKLAHOMA OZARKS TO DETERMINE THEIR IMPORTANCE TO THREATENED AND ENDANGERED BATS, THE OZARK CAVEFISH AND A DIVERSITY OF RARE CAVE-DEPENDENT SPECIES SUCH CAVE CRAYFISH, GROTTO SALAMANDERS, AND SUBTERRANEAN AMPHIPODS AND ISOPODS. THESE SURVEYS ARE IMPORTANT TO ASSESS AND PRIORITIZE CAVES FOR FUTURE PROTECTION EFFORTS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE CONSERVATION BENEFITS FOR LISTED SPECIES AND SUBTERRANEAN BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY.THIS PROJECT SERVES MANY PURPOSES FOR CONSERVATION OF LISTED BAT SPECIES IN OKLAHOMA. THE PROTECTION OF MATERNITY COLONIES SHOULD RESULT IN GREATER SUCCESSFUL REPRODUCTION AND RECRUITMENT OF YOUNG BATS INTO THE LOCAL POPULATION. THE PROTECTION OF MAJOR HIBERNACULA SHOULD RESULT IN INCREASED ADULT OVER-WINTER SURVIVAL RATES FOR OZARK BIG-EARED BATS. THIS PROJECT SHOULD ALSO HELP INCREASE THE LOCAL OZARK BIG-EARED BAT AND GRAY BAT POPULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC CAVES AND MAY FACILITATE THE RECOLONIZATION OF NEW CAVES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INHABITED BY THESE SPECIES. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO HELP TO EDUCATE CAVE OWNERS AND DEMONSTRATE TO THEM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CAVES AND THE INTEREST THAT EXISTS FOR BATS AND THEIR CONSERVATION. POST-CONSTRUCTION MONITORING OF BAT COLONIES WILL DOCUMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CAVE PROTECTION MEASURES.

RCWS EXCLUSIVELY USE LIVING, MATURE PINES (PINUS SP.) FOR FORAGING AND CAVITY EXCAVATION. AT ITS WESTERNMOST RANGE PERIPHERY IN THE SOUTHCENTRAL U.S., TWO POPULATIONS OF RCWS OCCUR, ONE IN OKLAHOMA AND ONE IN ARKANSAS, WITH BOTH ON STATE AND FEDERAL LANDS WITHIN THE OUACHITA MOUNTAINS ECOREGION. BY THE MID-1970S, RCWS IN OKLAHOMA HAD DWINDLED TO FEWER THAN 30 FAMILY GROUPS WITHIN MCCURTAIN AND PUSHMATAHA COUNTIES. THE PRIMARY THREATS TO THESE REMAINING GROUPS ARE 1) HABITAT DEGRADATION DUE TO GRADUAL CHANGES IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE THAT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF APPROXIMATELY 80 YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION, AND 2) POOR NESTING SUCCESS DUE TO MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING NEST DEPREDATION, CAVITY KLEPTOPARASITISM, REDUCED FOOD BASE AND POTENTIAL INBREEDING.SINCE 1992, THE OKLAHOMA DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (ODWC), WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE AND THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE (USFS), HAS WORKED TO IMPROVE HABITAT CONDITIONS ON THE MCWA WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING THE POPULATION OF RCWS ON THE AREA TO 45 BREEDING GROUPS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE ENHANCING EACH NESTING STAND BY PLACING PREDATOR GUARDS ON CAVITY TREES, PLACING RESTRICTOR PLATES AROUND EXISTING CAVITIES TO EXCLUDE LARGER WOODPECKER SPECIES (E.G. PILEATED WOODPECKER), AND INSTALLING ARTIFICIAL CAVITY INSERTS IN STANDS OF MATURE TREES ADJACENT TO EXISTING CAVITIES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL NESTING AND ROOSTING SITES. THESE SAME MEASURES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AT INACTIVE NESTING STANDS, CALLED RECRUITMENT STANDS, TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SECURE, POTENTIAL NESTING AREAS INTO WHICH YOUNG WOODPECKERS MAY DISPERSE. IN COOPERATION WITH USFS, THE ODWC HAS ESTABLISHED A PRESCRIBED BURNING PROGRAM ON THE AREA THAT IS CONDUCTED DURING THE WINTER MONTHS IN THE PORTIONS OF THE MCWA THAT ARE DOMINATED BY MATURE SHORTLEAF PINES. THE REINTRODUCTION OF FIRE INTO THIS SYSTEM IS SLOWING REDUCING THE WOODY UNDERSTORY AND MID-STORY VEGETATION AND OVER TIME THIS WILL REDUCE THE COMPETITION FOR MOISTURE AND LIGHT FOR THE MATURE PINES. PRESCRIBED BURNING ALSO MAINTAINS AND RESTORES THE HERBACEOUS UNDERSTORY THAT ONCE OCCURRED WITHIN THE PINE-DOMINATED STANDS, THUS INCREASING THE INSECT PREY BASE FOR THE RCW POPULATION. DURING THE PAST 19 YEARS, THESE HABITAT IMPROVEMENTS HAVE STABILIZED THE POPULATION OF RCWS ON THE MCWA.THE DIRECT HABITAT MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF RECRUITMENT STANDS SHOULD ULTIMATELY INCREASE THE CURRENT POPULATION SIZE AND LONG-TERM POPULATION VIABILITY OF RED-COCKADED WOODPECKERS (RCW) IN OKLAHOMA. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCAL RCW WOODPECKER DISPERSAL, THIS PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE SPECIES POPULATION SIZE AND GENETIC DIVERSITY WITHIN THE LARGER META-POPULATION THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE OUACHITA MOUNTAINS OF OKLAHOMA AND ARKANSAS. ON-GOING SHORTLEAF PINE/BLUESTEM SAVANNAH RESTORATION ON THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF OUACHITA NATIONAL FOREST LAND SURROUNDING THE MCCURTAIN COUNTY WILDERNESS AREA WILL ULTIMATELY CREATE NEW HABITAT INTO WHICH WOODPECKERS CAN DISPERSE.

POLAR BEAR MANAGEMENT IN ALASKA REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF ITS SUBPOPULATIONS (I.E., SOUTHERN BEAUFORT SEA [SBS] AND CHUKCHI SEA), WHICH ARE HARVESTED BY ALASKA NATIVE PEOPLE. ABUNDANCE AND TREND DATA FOR THE SBS SUBPOPULATION IS DEFICIENT. SOME BEARS DEN ON LAND WITHIN ALASKA'S ACTIVE OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND SEA ICE (AN IMPORTANT POLAR BEAR HABITAT) IS ALSO DECREASING RAPIDLY. AS SUCH, THE SBS SUBPOPULATION IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF SEVERAL MANAGEMENT CONCERNS RELATING TO HARVEST, DISTURBANCE FROM OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES, AND CLIMATE CHANGE.A FUNDAMENTAL NEED FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF SBS POLAR BEARS IS A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF ABUNDANCE AND INFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY AND SURVIVAL TO ESTIMATE TRENDS IN ABUNDANCE. THE MOST CURRENT ESTIMATE OF 573 BEARS COMES FROM DATA COLLECTED DURING 2006-2015 FOR THE PORTION OF THE SUBPOPULATION IN ALASKA ONLY, WHICH WAS SHOWN TO BE STABLE DURING THAT TIME. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SBS SUBPOPULATION TREND SINCE THEN. THIS SUBPOPULATION HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR RELATIVELY HIGH COMBINED ANNUAL HARVEST BY U.S. AND CANADIAN SUBSISTENCE HUNTERS.REDUCED SEA ICE HAS MADE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO USE ESTABLISHED POLAR BEAR RESEARCH METHODS, SUCH AS USING HELICOPTERS TO LOCATE, IMMOBILIZE, AND FIT POLAR BEARS WITH SATELLITE-LINKED TRANSMITTERS (COLLARS). IN ADDITION, THERE IS ALSO A STRONG SENTIMENT AMONG COASTAL ALASKA COMMUNITIES AND THE ALASKA NANNUT CO-MANAGEMENT COUNCIL AGAINST INVASIVE HANDLING OF POLAR BEARS. THESE CONCERNS PROVIDED THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS PROJECT TO DEVELOP AND USE ALTERNATIVE NONINVASIVE METHODS OF IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUAL BEARS TO ESTIMATE ABUNDANCE AND ASSESS TRENDS.THIS PROJECT USES A NEWLY DEVELOPED METHOD OF COLLECTING A THIN LAYER OF SNOW FROM FRESH POLAR BEAR TRACKS TO ANALYZE POLAR BEAR DNA. GENETIC MATERIAL (I.E., DNA) FROM SLOUGHED SKIN IN THE TRACKS IS ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL POLAR BEARS AND THEIR SEX. SNOW FROM TRACKS WILL BE COLLECTED BY HUNTERS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND OIL INDUSTRY PERSONNEL ALONG THE BEAUFORT SEA COAST OF ALASKA. DATA COLLECTED ALONG WITH THE SNOW SAMPLE INCLUDES DATE AND LOCATION OF COLLECTION, SIZE OF TRACKS, AND NUMBER OF BEARS IN THE GROUP. GENETICALLY IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS CAN BE RE-IDENTIFIED BY SUBSEQUENT TRACK SAMPLING. RE-IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT MOVEMENTS, AGE, AND REPRODUCTIVE STATUS OF FEMALES (I.E., WHETHER A SOW HAS CUBS WITH HER).
