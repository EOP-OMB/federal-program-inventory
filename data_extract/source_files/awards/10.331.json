OFTEN, HOWEVER, THE FRESHEST AND MOST NUTRITIOUS ITEMS, LIKE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, CAN BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR MANY SHOPPERS. OVER 2.5 MILLION PENNSYLVANIA (PA) AND NEW JERSEY (NJ) RESIDENTS RECEIVE SNAP BENEFITS TO SUPPORT A HEALTHY DIET, BUT THOSE BENEFITS REGULARLY DO NOT STRETCH FAR ENOUGH, MAKING NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAMS VITAL. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED THE ISSUE OF HEALTHY FOOD ACCESS AND ITS EFFECTS ON HEALTH AND WELLBEING, ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND AREAS THAT HAVE SUFFERED NEGLECT AND UNDERINVESTMENT. AS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SNAP SURGES, AND BENEFIT AMOUNTS INCREASE, INCENTIVE PROGRAMS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT MORE SHOPPERS IN KEEPING NUTRITIOUS FOOD ON THE TABLE DURING A TIME WHEN EARLY REPORTS SUGGEST THAT FOOD INSECURITY AND CHILD HUNGER HAVE GREATLY INCREASED.IN RESPONSE TO THIS INCREASED COMMUNITY NEED AND UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND FOR PRODUCE INCENTIVES ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA (PA) AND NEW JERSEY (NJ), THE FOOD TRUST (TFT), WHOSE MISSION IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, NUTRITIOUS FOOD AND INFORMATION TO MAKE HEALTHY DECISIONS, SEEKS TO EXPAND ITS CURRENT THREE-YEAR GUSNIP PROJECT AND SUCCESSFUL COVID-19 RESPONSE EFFORTS WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM USDA&#39;S GUSNIP COVID RELIEF AND RESPONSE PROGRAM. FOR OVER A DECADE, THE FOOD BUCKS PROGRAM HAS BEEN PROVIDING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COUPONS AT THE POINT OF PURCHASE TO SHOPPERS USING SNAP BENEFITS. IN 2020, THE PROGRAM SAW A SIGNIFICANT SPIKE IN DISTRIBUTION AND REDEMPTION, AND NEW PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES TO REACH MORE FAMILIES. THROUGH THE COMBINATION OF THE GUSNIP 2020 AWARD AND GUSNIP CRR AWARD, THE KEY INTENDED OUTCOMES WILL BE: INCREASING THE VOLUME OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INCENTIVES REDEEMED FROM $750,000 TO OVER $1,800,000 (USDA AND MATCH COMBINED); MAXIMIZING THE INCENTIVES RATIO; PARTNERING WITH A TOTAL OF 35 BRICK AND MORTAR FIRMS (AN INCREASE OF 10); AND REACHING 75,000 SHOPPERS USING SNAP BENEFITS ACROSS ALL SITES.TFT&#39;S ORIGINAL GUSNIP LARGE SCALE PROPOSAL HAS AN OVERALL GOAL TO DEMONSTRATE INCREASED FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PURCHASING AND CONSUMPTION BY SHOPPERS USING SNAP BENEFITS BY IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING AN EXPANDED FOOD BUCKS INCENTIVE PROGRAM AT SUPERMARKETS, CORNER STORES, FARMERS/MOBILE MARKETS AND OTHER NON-TRADITIONAL RETAIL OUTLETS. THE PROGRAM&#39;S OBJECTIVES ARE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FIRMS AND GEOGRAPHIES PARTICIPATING IN FOOD BUCKS TO REACH MORE SHOPPERS; INCREASE FRESH PRODUCE PURCHASING AT PARTICIPATING FIRMS BY UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY, DIGITAL INCENTIVES AND BEST PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT EFFICIENT, REPLICABLE INCENTIVE MODELS; AND INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE FOOD BUCKS PROGRAM THROUGH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, RIGOROUS OUTREACH AND RETAIL STAFF TRAINING.TFT IS ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, AND HAS SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED THE NEED FOR PROGRAMS LIKE FOOD BUCKS THAT MAKE NUTRITIOUS FOOD MORE ACCESSIBLE. AS RATES OF FOOD INSECURITY HAVE INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC, NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAMS HAVE FILLED A KEY ROLE FOR MANY FAMILIES TO SUSTAIN HEALTHY EATING, AND FOR MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND FARMERS TO GENERATE REVENUE. FURTHERMORE, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM SINCE IT REACHES COMMUNITIES MOST AT RISK FOR AND EXPERIENCING COVID-19, WHICH ARE OFTEN, AND UNSURPRISINGLY, THE SAME COMMUNITIES FACING LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTHY, AFFORDABLE FOOD. TFT&#39;S SERVICE REGION INCLUDES URBAN CENTERS LIKE PHILADELPHIA, PITTSBURGH AND CAMDEN, AS WELL AS RURAL COMMUNITIES IN CENTRAL PA. ALL COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY SERVED BY FOOD BUCKS EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF POVERTY, FOOD INSECURITY, HEALTH DISPARITIES AND SNAP UTILIZATION. ADDITIONALLY, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF TFT&#39;S EXISTING INCENTIVE PROGRAMMING IS LOCATED IN, OR ADJACENT TO, OPPORTUNITY ZONES; THESE AREAS WILL BE A KEY CONSIDERATION IN IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITIZING LOCATIONS FOR EXPANSION. THESE REGIONS ARE ALSO WORKING HARD TO IMPROVE OVERALL WELLBEING FOR RESIDENTS, AND FOOD BUCKS INTEGRATES WELL WITH COMMUNITY-DRIVEN EFFORTS TO INCREASE FOOD SECURITY AND COMBAT HEALTH DISPARITIES.THIS PROPOSED EXPANSION BUILDS UPON TFT&#39;S HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, AND ONGOING, COVID-19 RESPONSE EFFORTS. ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION&#39;S NETWORK OF PARTICIPATING FIRMS THAT SHARED DATA, IN 2020 SNAP SALES GREW BY OVER 50% (AND 70% AT FARMERS MARKETS) AND TOTAL FOOD BUCKS REDEMPTIONS WERE $380,000 (AN INCREASE OF NEARLY 100% FROM 2019). TFT ALSO INCREASED THE INCENTIVE RATIO OFFERED AT FARMERS MARKETS AND SUPERMARKETS FROM 40% (SPEND $5, GET $2) TO 100% (SPEND $2, GET $2) BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER 2020, AND SOME FARMERS MARKETS RECORDED AS HIGH AS A FOURFOLD INCREASE IN FOOD BUCKS REDEMPTIONS OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEASON. TFT EXPECTS THE NEED IN 2021 TO BE EVEN GREATER; BASED ON EARLY SEASON DATA, THE FOOD BUCKS PROGRAM COULD BE ON TRACK TO REDEEM OVER $500,000 IN ONE YEAR, OR $1 MILLION IF THE RATIO WAS INCREASED TO 100%, PARTICULARLY AT SITES THAT FEATURE LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCE AND/OR INCENTIVES THAT ARE EARNED AND REDEEMED ON PRODUCE. TFT IS PREPARING TO MEET THAT NEED BY SUPPORTING AN INCREASED INCENTIVE AT FARMERS MARKETS AND SUPERMARKETS (UP TO 100% AS BUDGET ALLOWS), BY CONTINUING TO SUPPORT FRESH PRODUCE PURCHASES IN CORNER STORES, AND BY GROWING THE NUMBER OF FIRMS PROVIDING FOOD BUCKS TO REACH MORE SHOPPERS IN NEW GEOGRAPHIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "88da49aa-0804-b4c5-b6c8-95ce80dbd64d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20217003435361_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 138340979, "Award ID": "20217003435360", "Award Amount": 5000000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-06", "CFDA Number": "10.331", "Description": "SINCE 2014, THE FOOD BASKET, HAWAI&#39;I ISLAND&#39;S FOOD BANK, HAS PIONEERED NUTRITION INCENTIVES TO INCREASE THE PURCHASE OF HAWAI&#39;I GROWN PRODUCE AMONG SNAP BENEFICIARIES.

THE FARMERS&#39; MARKETS THAT WILL PARTNER FOR THE PROJECT ARE THE CITY OF WHITESBURG/LETCHER COUNTY FARMER&#39;S MARKET, OWSLEY COUNTY FARMER&#39;S MARKET, AND THE LEATHERWOOD/BLACKEY FARMER&#39;S MARKET. THE FARMER&#39;S MARKETS OPERATE FROM LATE MAY TO LATE SEPTEMBER EACH YEAR. THE FRESH PRODUCE VENDORS WILL HAVE VARIOUS HOURS AND DAYS OF OPERATION, WHICH WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO FRESH PRODUCE FOR THE PARTICIPANTS. THE FARMACY PROGRAM WILL NOT REQUIRE A SEPARATE PURCHASE TO EARN THE INCENTIVE. INTERESTED MCHC PATIENTS WHO ARE SNAP PARTICIPANTS WILL BE REFERRED TO THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN (PCP) TO RECEIVE BASELINE MEASUREMENTS AND A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE FARMACY PROGRAM. ALL ENROLLED PATIENTS MUST HAVE A DIAGNOSIS OF, OR BE AT RISK FOR (DUE TO FAMILY HISTORY OR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH), TYPE 2 DIABETES, HYPERTENSION OR OBESITY.THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT USED FOR INCENTIVE DELIVERY WILL BE TOKENS. THE FARMACY PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS WILL PRESENT THEIR I.D. AND SNAP CARD TO THE PROGRAM MANAGER. THE PROGRAM MANAGER WILL THEN FIND THAT PARTICIPANT&#39;S NAME ON THE ELIGIBILITY LIST, WHICH IS GENERATED WEEKLY. THE PROGRAM MANAGER WILL DISPERSE $30 WORTH OF TOKENS THAT ARE MARKED IN VALUES OF $1 AND $5 TO THE PARTICIPANT. THESE TOKENS CAN THEN BE SPENT, LIKE CASH, AT EACH VENDOR&#39;S LOCATION, EITHER AT A PARTICIPATING FARMER&#39;S MARKET OR A PARTICIPATING LOCAL FRESH PRODUCE VENDOR, TO PURCHASE FRESH, LOCALLY OR REGIONALLY GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.MCHC WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES OF OUR DIETITIAN, ERIN GIBSON, MS, RD, LD AND OUR NURSE PRACTITIONER WHO SPECIALIZES IN DIABETES, FOR THE FARMACY PROGRAM. COOKING AND FOOD-PREP DEMONSTRATIONS WILL BE PROVIDED ON-SITE, TO TEACH PARTICIPANTS HOW TO INCORPORATE VARIOUS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES INTO THEIR DAILY MEALS.AS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER, MCHC IS CONSTANTLY SEEKING WAYS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR PATIENTS AND TO HELP IMPROVE THE ECONOMY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR FARMACY PROGRAM AND THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY USDA NIFA FINI AWARD 2017-70025-26684, WE FOUND A WAY TO ACHIEVE BOTH OF THOSE GOALS SIMULTANEOUSLY. AS WE IMPLEMENTED OUR PRODUCE PRESCRIPTION PROGRAM (PRX FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS APPLICATION), WE WERE THRILLED TO DISCOVER THAT OUR PATIENTS WERE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY BY USING THE INCENTIVES (TOKENS) THAT THE GRANT PROVIDED TO PURCHASE FRESH PRODUCE FROM VENDORS AT PARTICIPATING LOCAL FARMER&#39;S MARKETS. THE INCENTIVES GAVE THESE SNAP RECIPIENTS UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO FRESH, LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCE FOR IMMEDIATE CONSUMPTION AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO CAN AND FREEZE THE ITEMS FOR LATER USE. THESE ACTIVITIES PROVIDED A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE PATIENT PARTICIPANTS AND HELPED THE PARTICIPATING FARMER&#39;S MARKETS TO GROW AND PROSPER. WE COLLECTED BASELINE MEASUREMENTS OF VITAL SIGNS AND BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS UPON ENROLLMENT INTO THE PROGRAM AND AGAIN AT PROGRAMS END, TO DETERMINE THE OVERALL CHANGE IN HEALTH OUTCOMES DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAM. ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS LEARNED HEALTHY FOOD PURCHASING AND PREPARATION HABITS, AND SHOWED AT LEAST A MINOR IMPROVEMENT IN EACH HEALTH MEASURE, WITH MANY SHOWING VAST IMPROVEMENTS.COVID-19 SEVERELY IMPACTED OUR OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT FOR 2020. IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR PATIENTS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE, WE IMPLEMENTED A DRIVE THRU VERSION OF OUR PROGRAM TO SAFELY SERVE THE PATIENTS THAT WERE WILLING TO VENTURE OUT OF THEIR HOMES. FRESH PRODUCE WAS PACKED INTO BAGS AND BOXES BY THE VENDORS AND EACH PARTICIPANT WHO DROVE THROUGH THE PARKING LOT,RECEIVED A SET AMOUNT BASED ON FAMILY SIZE. THE PANDEMIC NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PARTICIPATION, BUT THE NECESSITY OF IMPLEMENTING SAFETY MEASURES AND BUILDING EFFICIENCY INTO THE PROCESS, GAVE US SOME GOOD IDEAS FOR EXPANSION AS SOME OF THE PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED.WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING, WE PLAN TODO MORE OUTREACH AND MARKETING DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER/PATIENT. WE ALSO PLAN TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT AT EACH LOCATION AND GIVE EACH PARTICIPANT A LARGER INCENTIVE AMOUNT. WE ALSO PLAN TO CREATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH A DIVERSITY OF VENDORS, SUCH AS LOCAL PRODUCE VENDORS WHO ACCEPT SNAP BENEFITS, AND GET THEM TO ACCEPT THE FARMACY TOKENS (INCENTIVES) FROM PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS FOR ELIGIBLE PRODUCE PURCHASES. THESE RELATIONSHIPS WILL INCREASE THE DAYS AND HOURS THAT PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ABLE TO USE THEIR INCENTIVES (TOKENS) TO GAIN ACCESS TO FRESH, LOCAL AND REGIONALLY GROWN PRODUCE. WE ALSO PLAN TO USE OUR APRN SPECIALIZING IN DIABETES, OUR DIABETIC EDUCATORS AND OUR REGISTERED DIETICIAN TO ASSIST OUR DIABETIC PARTICIPANTS IN USING THIS PROGRAM TO HELP WIN THE BATTLE WITH THEIR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS. ALONG WITH SELF-EVALUATION, MCHC WILL PROVIDE ANNUAL REPORTS TO NIFA AND COLLABORATE WITH NTAE IN EVERY WAY, AS WELL AS PERIODICALLY PROVIDING THE NTAE CENTERS A CORE PROGRAM DATA SET TO ENSURE COMMON PROGRAM TRACKING AND ENABLE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS ACROSS ALL PROJECTS.THESE EXPANDED PROJECT GOALS WILL ALLOW US TO SERVE MORE PARTICIPANTS THAT PROBABLY WENT A WHOLE YEAR WITHOUT ACCESS TO FRESH, LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY GROWN PRODUCE, DUE TO THEIR INABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE OF PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS, OR THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO POTENTIALLY EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO THE VIRUS BY VENTURING OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. THE EXTRA INCENTIVE (TOKENS) AMOUNT, COUPLED WITH THE ADDITIONAL HOURS AND ACCESS, WILL HOPEFULLY ALLOW THE PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT THEY MISSED LAST YEAR AND GET BACK ON THE PATH TO A HEALTHY DIET AND GOOD OVERALL HEALTH. ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT SPACES WILL ALLOW SOME PEOPLE TO ACCESS THE PROGRAM THAT WERE UNABLE TO BEFORE, THUS EXPANDING THE PROGRAM BENEFITS TO A BROADER SLICE OF THE COMMUNITY. ALL OF THE EXPANSION ACTIVITIES LISTED ABOVE WILL ADD UP TO AN INCREASED BENEFIT FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY AS MORE DOLLARS ARE FILTERED INTO THE HANDS OF A LARGER GROUP OFFRESH PRODUCE VENDORS AND SUBSEQUENTLY PUT BACK INTO THE LOCAL ECONOMY AS THE VENDORS SPEND THEIR REVENUE ON OTHER LOCAL GOODS AND SERVICES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "eb8a6cb6-cd70-0024-2448-d6f6c31c8fc2-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20217003434990_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 134198919, "Award ID": "20217003434989", "Award Amount": 431250.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-25", "CFDA Number": "10.331", "Description": "THIS GUSCRR PROJECT WILL BUILD UPON WINDY CITY HARVEST&#39;S EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, CONDUCTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THREE HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS AT FOUR LOCATIONS IN THE CHICAGO REGION.

THE FACT THAT A SUPERSTORE IN THE USA AVERAGES ~65,000 SQ FT OF RETAIL SPACE WHILE A CORNER STORE IS ~1,200 SQ FT ILLUSTRATES THE DISPARITY IN PURCHASING VOLUME AND POWER. WITH THE GROWTH OF SUPERSIZE STORES, AND CHAIN BUSINESSES, BIASES IN ACCESSING PRODUCTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN BECAME INHERENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIZE OF A STORE. THE ECONOMY OF SCALE SAYS THE MORE YOU PURCHASE, THE MORE AFFORDABLE YOUR PRODUCTS WILL BE ON THE SHELF AND THE MORE YOU CAN DICTATE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS. WITH THIS LEVEL OF COMPETITION, CORNER STORES HAVE TO STOCK NON-PERISHABLE ITEMS, AND LOW-MAINTENANCE PRODUCTS (I.E.

FURTHER,THERE ARE OVER 750,000 NJ RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVE SNAP BENEFITS EACH MONTH, AND THE STATE HAS AN OVERALL POVERTY RATE OF 9.2%. MORE THAN 64% OF SNAP PARTICIPANTS ARE FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. ALMOST 47% OF SNAP PARTICIPANTS ARE IN FAMILIES WITH MEMBERS WHO ARE ELDERLY OR WHO HAVE DISABILITIES, AND ALMOST 44% AREIN WORKING FAMILIES (USDA SNAP DATA).THE NEED FOR IMPROVING CONSUMPTION OF HEALTHY FOOD FOR LOW-INCOME NEW JERSEYANS IS EVIDENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH STATISTICS, AND KEY BARRIERS TO CONNECTING CONSUMERS TO PRODUCERS ARE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY.CITY GREEN&#39;S GARDEN STATE GOOD FOOD PROGRAM TACKLES THESE BARRIERS HEAD ON. IN OPERATION SINCE 2011, THE GSGF IS A STATEWIDE NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT EQUIPS A NETWORK OF NEW JERSEY FARMERS MARKETS, FARM STANDS, AND GROCERY STORESWITH THE FUNDING, TRAINING, AND TOOLS THEY NEED TO PROVIDE A DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR MATCH TO NEW JERSEY SNAP SHOPPERS SO THEY CAN PURCHASE TWICE AS MANY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. EVERY TIME A CUSTOMER SPENDS $1 OF THEIR SNAP BENEFITS AT ANY PARTICIPATING MARKET, THEY RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL $1 IN \"GOOD FOOD BUCKS\" FOR MORE FRESH PRODUCE.RESEARCH SHOWS THAT NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAMS LIKE THE GARDEN STATE GOOD FOOD PROGRAM INCREASE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION AND PURCHASES AMONG SNAP RECIPIENTS, PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVENUE AND AN INCREASED CUSTOMER BASE FOR LOCAL FARMERS, STIMULATE LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND BUILD STRONG CONNECTIONS BETWEEN RURAL PRODUCERS AND URBAN CONSUMERS.THROUGH THIS FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITY, CITY GREEN WILL UNIFY AND EXPAND THE GSGF NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAMTO 40SNAP AUTHORIZED FARMERS MARKETS AND SUPERMARKETS ACROSS 12-15 NJ COUNTIES, THEREBY REACHING22,000 NJ SNAP PARTICIPANTS, INCREASINGTHE PURCHASE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY SNAP PARTICIPANTS, AND INCREASINGPRODUCER-TO-CONSUMER MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR NJ FARMERS.

CLARK COUNTY, WHICH IS COMPRISED LARGELY OF THE LAS VEGAS VALLEY, MAKES UP OVER 70% OF THE STATE&#39;S POPULATION, NORTHERN NEVADA MAKES UP 25% WHILE MOAPA VALLEY IS A SPARSELY POPULATED RURAL TOWN. ONE IN SIX SOUTHERN NEVADANS, OR MORE THAN 305,000 PEOPLE, STRUGGLE WITH HUNGER. DURING THE 2017-2019 SCHOOL YEAR, MORE THAN 68% OF THE STUDENTS ATTENDING CLARK COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT, THE FIFTH LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY, WERE ENROLLED IN FREE OR REDUCED-PRICE MEAL PROGRAMS AND 59% OF STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED IN NORTHERN NEVADA. OVER 175,000 PEOPLE WITHIN THESE TWO COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE SUPERMARKETS WITHIN 2 MILES OF THEIR RESIDENCE, THE CRITERIA FOR LIVING IN A FOOD DESERT. THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES IN CLARK COUNTY THAT RELY ON SNAP BENEFITS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. CLARK COUNTY COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECESSION. ACCORDING TO LOCAL DATA, NEARLY 50% OF SNAP PARTICIPANTS ARE CHILDREN 18 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER, AND 12% ARE SENIORS, BOTH POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS RELATIVE TO ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD. THE MEDIAN INCOME RANGE IS $19,000 PER YEAR AND THE AVERAGE SNAP BENEFIT IN NEVADA IN 2019 FOR A FOOD-INSECURE FAMILY WAS $253 PER MONTH, WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH TO ADEQUATELY FEED A FAMILY NUTRITIOUS MEALS. ONE OF THE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE PROJECT IS ACCESS TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THOSE LIVING IN A FOOD DESERT OFTEN HAVE INADEQUATE OPTIONS TO OBTAIN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, AND CONSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY MEETING THE DIETARY GUIDELINES. THIS INCLUDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AN INCREASE IN TOTAL VEGETABLE INTAKE FROM ALL VEGETABLE SUBGROUPS, IN NUTRIENT-DENSE FORMS, AND AN INCREASE IN THE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CONSUMED OVER TIME. BECAUSE SOUTHERN NEVADA IS A DESERT AND NOT KNOWN AS AN AGRICULTURAL OASIS, MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE NOT AWARE OF FARMERS MARKETS AVAILABLE TO OFFER FRESH, LOCALLY OR REGIONALLY PRODUCED PRODUCE. MANY SNAP PARTICIPANTS ARE UNAWARE THAT THEY CAN REDEEM THEIR SNAP BENEFITS AT A LOCAL FARMER&#39;S MARKET AND THERE IS A FALSE PERCEPTION THAT THE FARMERS&#39; MARKETS CATER ONLY TO THE AFFLUENT AND THAT THE COST OF PRODUCE AT THE FARMERS&#39; MARKETS IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF PRODUCE PURCHASED FROM A LOCAL GROCERY STORE. A SOUTHERN NEVADA HEALTH DEPARTMENT COMMUNITY FOOD ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED AND COMPARED THE COST OF PRODUCE FROM VENDORS AT A LOCAL FARMERS MARKET TO THE COST OF PRODUCE IN SEVERAL LOCAL GROCERY STORES AND FOUND THAT THE COST OF PRODUCE AT THE FARMERS MARKETS WAS COMPARABLE TO OR, IN MANY CASES, LESS THAN AT A LOCAL GROCERY STORE. IN THE FARMERS&#39; MARKETS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING EBT, SNAP-REDEMPTION RATES, WHILE SHOWING SLIGHT INCREASES IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, ARE NOT BEING MAXIMIZED LARGELY IN PART DUE TO LACK OF PROMOTION AND AWARENESS OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICE.

WITH ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND LINGERING EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AHEAD, NEW MEXICANS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE SUFFERING FROM UNEMPLOYMENT, SAGGING INCOMES, AND FOOD INSECURITY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE POSITIVE CHANGES IN PEOPLES&#39; COOKING AND EATING HABITS, ALONG WITH THE MOMENTUM FOR GROWTH SHOWN OVER SIX SUCCESSFUL YEARS OF DOUBLE UP PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, MAKE THIS A CRITICAL TIME TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF SNAP INCENTIVES.NEW MEXICO OFTEN APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF MANY NATIONAL HEALTH RANKINGS: 50TH IN FOOD INSECURITY, 49TH IN HIGHEST POVERTY LEVEL, 47TH IN UNEMPLOYMENT, AND 40TH IN DIABETES. IT IS NOT SURPRISING, THEREFORE, THAT ITS LOW-INCOME POPULATION IS HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND, AS ONE WOULD EXPECT, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HIT THE STATE HARD. ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY A UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS PROFESSOR, NEW MEXICO WAS ONE OF FIVE STATES WHOSE FOOD INSECURITY LEVELS WERE MOST DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC.FURTHER, FEEDING AMERICA PROJECTS THAT IN 2020 THE NUMBER OF NEW MEXICANS EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY HAS INCREASED NEARLY 25% TO 434,570.2 THIS MEANS THAT ONE IN FIVE NEW MEXICANS CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO FOOD, AND THAT NOW NEARLY ONE IN THREE (30%) OF CHILDREN SUFFER FROM FOOD INSECURITY.WHILE 2020 WAS DEVASTATING ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF MANY NEW MEXICANS, IT WAS AT THE SAME TIME A BANNER YEAR FOR SALES OF LOCAL FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT NM FOOD OUTLETS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE&#39;S DOUBLE UP FOOD BUCKS PROGRAM (DOUBLE UP) WHICH PROVIDES DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR INCENTIVES FOR SNAP PURCHASES OF NEW MEXICO-GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT FARMERS&#39; MARKETS, FARM STANDS, GROCERY STORES, CSAS, AND MOBILE MARKETS. DURING THE LAST YEAR, SNAP AND DOUBLE UP SALES NEARLY DOUBLED, INCREASING FROM ROUGHLY $969,000 IN 2019 TO $1,547,000 IN 2020. THE PANDEMIC HAS LED TO MORE MEALS COOKED AT HOME,AND THE DOUBLE UP PROGRAM HAS HELPED MANY LOW-INCOME NEW MEXICANS AFFORD MORE NEW MEXICO-GROWN PRODUCE TO INCLUDE IN THOSE HOME-COOKED MEALS. OF NEARLY 700 DOUBLE UP PARTICIPANTS SURVEYED LAST YEAR, 73% REPORTED THAT THE AMOUNT OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THEY EAT HAD INCREASED DUE TO THE PROGRAM.THIS COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE LOCAL FOOD SYSTEM IS RAMPING UP TO MEET GROWING NEEDS. NEW MEXICO HAS A RICH AGRICULTURAL HISTORY AND ANNUAL GROSS RECEIPTS FROM FARMING ARE $3 BILLION, YET 97% OF PRODUCTS LEAVE THE STATE. HOWEVER, DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER SALES AND STATE PROCUREMENT PROGRAMS ARE GROWING. THE LOCAL FOOD SYSTEM IS AT A PIVOTAL STAGE AS WITNESSED BY LOCAL FOOD HUB GROWTH, MORE YOUNG FARMERS, AND RECENT PHILANTHROPIC INVESTMENT IN FARM INFRASTRUCTURE--ALL OF WHICH ARE HELPING TO BUILD CAPACITY AND MEET GROWING DEMAND.DOUBLE UP PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN STIMULATING THE LOCAL FOOD SYSTEM. OUR SALES DATA INDICATE THAT SNAP AND DOUBLE UP ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 10% OF THE $12 MILLION IN DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER SALES OF LOCAL PRODUCE. OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS THE DOUBLE UP PROGRAM HAS PUT MORE THAN $5.6 MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE POCKETS OF NM FARMERS, MANY OF WHOM ALSO QUALIFY AS LOW-INCOME AND/OR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED. IN FACT, 74% OF FARMERS&#39; MARKET VENDORS SAY THEY HAVE A NEW CUSTOMER BASE AND ARE MAKING MORE MONEY BECAUSE OF THE DOUBLE UP PROGRAM. THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL INCOME STREAM FOR NEW MEXICO&#39;S SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED FARMS WHO OPERATE ON TINY PROFIT MARGINS, ESPECIALLY SINCE COVID-19 HAS SLOWED FARM-TO-INSTITUTION AND FARM-TO-RESTAURANT SALES.DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER SALES ARE NOW EVEN MORE CRITICAL FOR THESE FARMERS AND THE PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE IN (POVERTY RATES IN RURAL NM ARE 19.6% V. 16.4% IN URBAN AREAS). THE USDA ERS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SNAP SPENDING CREATES AT LEAST A 1.8 ECONOMIC MULTIPLIER, MEANING THAT EVERY SNAP/DOUBLE UP DOLLAR SPENT BRINGS AN ADDITIONAL $1.80 OR MORE INTO THE LOCAL ECONOMY--ESSENTIAL WHEN MANY OF THE STATE&#39;S OTHER INDUSTRIES SUCH AS HOSPITALITY HAVE BEEN DRASTICALLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NM", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "72ede1ec-976d-fcdd-10b6-7ea19f0c66cf-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20217003035719_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 111064391, "Award ID": "20207003033194", "Award Amount": 500000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-17", "CFDA Number": "10.331", "Description": "HEALTHY, LOCAL FOOD FOR ALL MONTANANS: ADVANCING EQUITY AND FOOD ACCESS THROUGH THE DOUBLE SNAP DOLLARS NETWORK LEVERAGES MULTI-SECTOR COLLABORATION AND EXPERTISE TO INCREASE THE IMPACT OF THE DOUBLE SNAP DOLLARS (DSD) PROGRAM IN THREE SPECIFIC WAYS: ADVANCING EQUITY, DIVERSIFYING PARTICIPATING SITES TO SERVE RURAL AREAS, AND IMPROVING MARKETING.

THIS IS OF PARTICULAR SALIENCE AS 50% OF THE POPULATION OFNAVAJO NATION IS UNDER 29 YEARS OF AGE, AND 20% ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 10-19 YEARS,REPRESENTING THE LARGEST AGE GROUP.13IN RESPONSE TO THESE PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS, THERE HAS BEEN GROWING MOMENTUM AMONG LEADERS AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATES TO STRENGTHEN FOOD SYSTEMS AND PROMOTE HEALTH AND WELLNESS IN NAVAJO NATION. SINCE 2014, COPE HAS PARTNERED WITH 14 HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, TWO COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS AND 26 STORES TO IMPLEMENT THE NAVAJO FVRX PROGRAM. THIS IS THE FIRST FVRX PROGRAM IN A RURAL NATIVE COMMUNITY. WHOLESOME WAVE (FOUNDED BY GUS SCHUMACHER)HAS PROVIDED AND CONTINUES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COPE FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION.BUILDING ON EXISTING FORMAL AGREEMENTS WITH NAVAJO AREA INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES, WE APPROACHEDCLINICAL SITES TO EXPLORE THEIR INTEREST IN OFFERING FVRX AT THEIR SITES. ALL SITES AGREED TO PARTICIPATE,FORMING PROVIDER TEAMS AND IMPLEMENTING FVRX. COPE HAS ALSO BEEN APPROACHED BY TRIBAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND HOME VISITATION PROGRAMS. IN TOTAL, WE HAVE TRAINED 17 TEAMS THAT OFFER FVRX PROGRAMS TO NAVAJO FAMILIES.THE PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT PROVIDER TEAMS MUST:INCLUDE MATERNAL/CHILD HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PROMOTION SPECIALISTS; ANDHAVE LEADERSHIP APPROVAL (E.G. DEPARTMENT SUPERVISOR) TO DELIVER FVRX.TO CONTINUE FVRX, TEAMS MUST MEET PROGRAM STANDARDS INCLUDING: SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPANTENROLLMENT AND RETENTION; MONTHLY HEALTH PROMOTION SESSIONS AND VOUCHER DISBURSEMENTS; ACTIVETEAM PARTICIPATION IN REGIONAL FVRX MEETINGS; AND TIMELY COLLECTION OF EVALUATION DATA.A KEY FACTOR FOR FVRX SUCCESS HAS BEEN EMBRACING LOCAL STORES AS VALUABLE ASSETS IN THENAVAJO FOOD SYSTEM. BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN THE ONLY FOOD SOURCE FOR MILES, LOCAL STORES CAN BEPROFOUND DRIVERS OF POSITIVE CHANGE. AMONG 22 MANAGERS SURVEYED IN AN EPI-AID REPORTAUTHORED BY THE NAVAJO NATION AND CDC, 91% WERE INTERESTED IN OFFERING MORE HEALTHY FOODS,BUT DESCRIBED BARRIERS OF LIMITED SUPPLIERS AND LOW CONSUMER DEMAND.
