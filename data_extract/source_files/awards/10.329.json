SLF FEEDING IS DETRIMENTAL TO GRAPEVINES CAUSING YIELD LOSSES OF UP TO 90%, ALONG WITH A REDUCTION IN WINE QUALITY, VINE DECLINE AND DEATH. THESE INSECTS WERE ACCIDENTALLY INTRODUCED TO PENNSYLVANIA IN 2014 AND HAVE SPREAD TO 13 ADDITIONAL STATES POSING A THREAT TO THE U.S. GRAPE AND WINE INDUSTRY. CURRENTLY, CHEMICAL PESTICIDES ARE THE MOST COMMON STRATEGY FOR CONTROLLING SLF POPULATIONS. GRAPE GROWERS HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED USE OF PESTICIDE SPRAYS IN THEIR VINEYARDS THAT HAS CONSIDERABLY AUGMENTED THEIR PRODUCTION COSTS AND REDUCED THEIR PROFIT. GRAPE GROWERS ARE AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTROLLING SLF IN THEIR VINEYARDS, BUT THEY ARE UNCERTAIN ON WHEN TO APPLY CONTROL TACTICS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP ACTION THRESHOLDS TO HELP GUIDE GROWERS ON THE APPROPRIATE SLF DENSITIES(NUMBER OF INSECTS PER PLANT) THAT NEED TO BE TARGETED TO AVOID ECONOMIC LOSS. ECONOMIC THRESHOLDS ARE THE BASIS OF INSECT PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, AND THEIR USE LEADS TO A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF PESTICIDES, REDUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH RISKS, HIGHER ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO GROWERS, AND REDUCTION OF PEST POPULATIONS. FIELD-ESTABLISHED GRAPEVINES WILL BE ENCLOSED IN MESH CAGES AND INFESTED WITH DIFERENT NUMBERS OF SLF INDIVIDUALS (FROM 0 TO ~320). AT THE END OF THE GROWING SEASON, THE VINES WILL BE HARVESTED AND WEIGHED TO DETERMINE YIELD. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL GRAPES FROM EACH VINE WILL BE USED FOR WINEMAKING. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF SLF PER VINE AND THE RESULTING YIELD AND WINE QUALITY WILL BE ASSESSED WITH APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL METHODS.

SINCE 2013, THE BSM RANGE HAS EXPANDED; AND THROUGH EDUCATION AND DEMONSTRATIONS PRODUCERS HAVE BECOME MORE AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE.REPORTS OF DAMAGING CHINCH BUG POPULATIONS HAVE INCREASED SINCE 2017, ESPECIALLY IN BERMUDAGRASS FERTILIZED WITH POULTRY LITTER. INSECTICIDES A RE EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING CONTROL, HOWEVER LIKE BSM DAMAGE SOME PRODUCERS ARE UNAWARE THAT CHINCH BUGS CAUSE THE DAMAGE.SPECIALTY CROP IPMSPECIALTY CROP PRODUCTION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF AR&#39;S STATE ECONOMY AND ADD DIVERSITY TO THE AGRICULTURE OF THE STATE.PRODUCTION OF SPECIALTY CROPS HAS INCREASED SINCE 2017 DUE TO INTEREST IN LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCE. THIS HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF SPECIALTY CROP PRODUCTION, AND AN INCREASE IN ORGANIC PRODUCTION, WITH TOTAL REVENUE OF $300,000 IN 2015, COMPARED TO ZERO ORGANIC REVENUE REPORTED PRIOR. EACH SPECIALTY CROP GROWN IN AR IS HEAVILY LIMITED BY PEST PROBLEMS INCLUDING INSECTS, WEEDS, AND DISEASE PRESSURE DUE TO THE WARM HUMID CLIMATE. AR HAS MANY PESTS OF SPECIALTY CROPS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE RESISTANT TO PESTICIDES. IT IS IMPORTANT IN AR FOR RESEARCH AND EXTENSION EFFORTS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO EXPAND THIS MARKET WHILE DEMAND INCREASES. RESEARCH ON FRUIT PESTS HAS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING TRAPS, SCOUTING METHODS, DEGREE-DAY MODELS, AND EVALUATING LOW RISK ALTERNATIVES TO SYNTHETIC INSECTICIDES TO MINIMIZE PEST DAMAGE.AR HAS POTENTIAL TO INCREASE PRODUCTION OF SPECIALTY CROPS. THE EASTERN DELTA OF THE STATE IS KNOWN FOR RICH SANDY SOILS THAT ARE IDEAL FOR SPECIALTY CROP PRODUCTION. GROWERS ARE DIVERSIFYING THEIR PRODUCTION TO INCLUDE SPECIALTY CROPS INCLUDING PEPPERS, SQUASH, CANTALOUPE,WATERMELON, AND PUMPKIN. MANY RESIDENTS OF THIS REGION HAVE STARTED PRODUCING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES TO SUPPORT LOCAL FOOD COMMUNITIES MORE INTERESTED IN LOCALLY SOURCED FOOD. TO SUPPORT OUR EXPANDING MARKET, WE MUST EVALUATE NEW METHODS TO HELP MANAGE OUR HIGH PEST PRESSURE. RATIONALE AND SIGNIFICANCE: LOCAL FRUIT, VEGETABLE, AND NUT PRODUCTION OFFERS ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO SMALL-FARM HOUSEHOLDS, COMMERCIAL FARMS, AND HEALTH BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS. SUPPORT FOR GROWERS IS NEEDED TO DEMONSTRATE USE OF TRAPS AND DEGREE-BASED, PEST PHENOLOGY MODELS TO MINIMIZE USE OF PESTICIDES, AND PROVIDE REAL-TIME DATA COLLECTION. FEW DECISION AIDES ARE AVAILABLE TO AR SPECIALTY CROP GROWERS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT TOOLS BE DEVELOPED THAT CAN BE UTILIZED BY GROWERS TO HELP MAKE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND OPTIONS THAT RELY LESS ON PROPHYLACTIC SPRAYS. SPECIALTY CROP PRODUCERS NEED APPROPRIATE PEST MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES AND INFORMATION ABOUT SUSTAINABLE IPM PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE THEIR PROFITS AND REDUCE RELIANCEON PESTICIDES. THEY ALSO NEED UP TO DATE INFORMATION ON LABELED PESTICIDE PERFORMANCE IN THE STATE OF AR. WITH THE INCREASING INTEREST IN LOCALLY PRODUCED FOODS, THERE IS INCREASED DEMAND BY GROWERS FOR REDUCED-RISK PESTICIDES AND ALTERNATIVE TACTICS THAT PRESERVE NATURAL ENEMIES AND NOT FLARE SECONDARY PESTS. MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED DUE TO FUNDINGCONSTRAINTS TO EVALUATE EFFICACY. PROFITABILITY, HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ALL BENEFIT FROM INCREASED DEVELOPMENT, DELIVERY, AND DEMONSTRATION OF IPM TACTICS. THE DIRECTION OF THE IPM PROGRAM IS DRIVEN BY INPUT RECEIVED FROM GROWERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ABOUT INSECT, WEED, OR DISEASE ISSUES THAT CURRENTLY THREATEN CROP PRODUCTION.IPM FOR POLLINATOR HEALTHAR FARMS PRODUCE OVER 20,000 ACRES OF ORCHARD CROPS, MELONS, BERRIES AND VEGETABLES (NASS 2017). PRODUCE TENDS TO BE SMALL-ACREAGE, HIGH-VALUE CROPS. THE ANNUAL VALUE OF THESE TO AR AGRICULTURE IS OVER $50 MILLION (NASS 2017). MOST FRUITS AND VEGETABLES DEPEND ON INSECT POLLINATION TO ENSURE HIGHER YIELD AND HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCE. HONEY BEES ARE THE MOST COMMONLY USED INSECT POLLINATOR FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. HONEY BEES PROVIDE EXCELLENT POLLINATION, AND ALSO PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL CROP OF HONEY.IPM SUPPORT FOR DIAGNOSTIC FACILITIESDIAGNOSTIC FACILITIES ARE CRITICAL TO SUPPORT IPM DECISION-MAKING IN THE FIELD, BY PROVIDING TIMELY, CORRECT IDENTIFICATION. CORRECT IDENTIFICATION OF A PEST, DISEASE OR WEED IS THE UNDERLYING BASIS OF IPM. MANY INSECTS, DISEASE SYMPTOMS OR WEEDS ARE RECOGNIZED BY GROWERS AND CONSULTANTS. EMERGING SPECIES OF CONCERN, SUCH AS INVADERS, CRYPTIC SPECIES, OR SPECIES THAT ARE SELDOM SEEN, REQUIRE IDENTIFICATION BY TRAINED SPECIALISTS. SINCE 2010, THE EXTENSION DIAGNOSTIC CLINIC (THE PLANT HEALTH CLINIC) MADE 20,558 IDENTIFICATIONS - PRIMARILY OF DISEASE SAMPLES, BUT ALSO ARTHROPODS AND WEEDS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF HERBICIDE RESISTANCE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF CROPPING SYSTEMS. GLYPHOSATE RESISTANT WEEDS (E.G., KOCHIA AND WATERHEMP) HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ARE A RESULT OF PREVIOUSLY LIMITED IPM EFFORTS. THAT IS, THE HEAVY RELIANCE ON GLYPHOSATE REPRESENTS A LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION FOR MODES OF ACTION AND CULTURAL METHODS. POPULATIONS OF SOYBEAN APHIDS AND RED SUNFLOWER SEED WEEVILS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED THAT ARE RESISTANT TO PYRETHROID CLASS INSECTICIDES. SIMILARLY, THESE PESTS WERE ROUTINELY MANAGED USING PYRETHROID CLASS INSECTICIDES. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE ISOLATES OF FROGEYE LEAF SPOT IN SD THAT ARE RESISTANT TO STROBILURIN FUNGICIDES.THE DEVELOPMENT OF PESTICIDE RESISTANCE IS AN INDICATOR THAT IPM IS EITHER NOT BEING UTILIZED OR THAT LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF DIFFERENT PESTICIDE CLASSES HAS RESULTED IN AN OVER-RELIANCE ON PESTICIDES WITH SIMILAR MODES OF ACTION. ADDITIONAL EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO FURTHER EDUCATE STAKEHOLDERS ON ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS TO REDUCE SELECTION PRESSURE AND PROMOTE THE LONGEVITY OF LABELED PESTICIDES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2018 A NEW SOYBEAN INSECT PEST, SOYBEAN GALL MIDGE, WAS IDENTIFIED IN SD. THIS PEST CAN CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL YIELD LOSSES, AND IPM AND EXTENSION MATERIALS HAVE BEEN REQUESTED BY SD SOYBEAN GROWERS. FOR THESE REASONS, SURVEYS OF PESTS IN MAJOR CROPS IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHEN NEW SPECIES ARE PRESENT OR WHEN PESTICIDE RESISTANCE HAS DEVELOPED.BOTH CONFECTION SUNFLOWERS AND DRY PEAS ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY WEEDS, INSECTS, AND DISEASES. HOWEVER, IT IS UNCOMMON FOR IPM STRATEGIES TO BE USED FOR PEST MANAGEMENT IN CONFECTION SUNFLOWERS, WHICH INSTEAD RELY HEAVILY ON PESTICIDES. FOR SOME OF THE MAJOR PESTS OF CONFECTION SUNFLOWERS, AN IPM APPROACH COULD REDUCE PEST INSECT IMPACT AND IN TURN REDUCE PESTICIDE DEPENDENCY. FOR DRY PEAS, THERE IS A LIMITED INFORMATION AVAILABLE REGARDING PESTS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT BUT REPORTS FROM OTHER STATES INDICATE THERE ARE NUMEROUS DOCUMENTED PESTS. ADDITIONAL EXTENSION EFFORTS ARE NECESSARY TO FURTHER EDUCATE GROWERS ON PROPER SCOUTING TECHNIQUES AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IPM INTO THEIR OPERATIONS. PESTICIDES ARE OFTEN APPLIED PROPHYLACTICALLY OR PRIOR TO PEST THRESHOLDS. FOR CONFECTION SUNFLOWERS, THE THRESHOLDS FOR SOME INSECT PESTS ARE SO LOW THAT THEY RESEMBLE PROPHYLACTIC MANAGEMENT. THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL IPM EXTENSION PROGRAMMING TO SPECIALTY CROP PRODUCERS IN SD. PART OF THIS PROGRAMMING WILL EVALUATE STRATEGIES TO REDUCE PEST POPULATIONS WITHOUT RELYING SOLELY ON PESTICIDES.ALTHOUGH HONEY BEES ARE VERY IMPORTANT POLLINATORS, THERE IS A LARGE COMMUNITY OF NATIVE POLLINATORS THAT ALSO PROVIDE IMPORTANT POLLINATION SERVICES. MALLINGER ET AL. (2019) DETERMINED THAT NATIVE SOLITARY BEES INCREASED CONFECTION SUNFLOWER YIELDS AFTER VISITATION. THERE IS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIVE POLLINATORS FOR POLLINATION SERVICES. MOST OF THE FOCUS IS ON HONEY BEES, AND OFTEN THE NATIVE POLLINATORS ARE OVERLOOKED OR MISIDENTIFIED AS HONEY BEES. THERE IS A NEED FOR INFORMATION TO ASSIST WITH POLLINATOR IDENTIFICATION, ESPECIALLY FOR NATIVE POLLINATORS THAT DO NOT HAVE COMMON NAMES. IN ADDITION, BROAD-SPECTRUM INSECTICIDES ARE OFTEN APPLIED TO CROPS DURING FLOWERING WHEN HONEY BEES AND NATIVE POLLINATORS ARE ACTIVE. THERE ARE LIMITED RECOMMENDATIONS AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES OR APPLICATION TIMINGS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF POLLINATOR MORTALITY. THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OF IDENTIFICATION GUIDES AND EXTENSION PRESENTATIONS, STAKEHOLDER AWARENESS OF POLLINATORS WILL INCREASE.IN SD THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 7,000 COMMERCIAL PESTICIDE APPLICATORS AND 16,000 PRIVATE PESTICIDE APPLICATORS. COMMERCIAL APPLICATORS ARE RE-CERTIFIED EVERY TWO YEARS AND PRIVATE APPLICATORS ARE RE-CERTIFIED EVERY THREE YEARS. BOTH GROUPS ARE RE-CERTIFIED BY EITHER RE-TESTING OR THROUGH TRAINING SESSIONS. THE INDIVIDUALS LICENSED IN SD ARE TRAINED TO IDENTIFY PESTS AND RECOGNIZE PEST THRESHOLDS. TO ENSURE THAT IPM PRINCIPLES ARE ENCOURAGED, THE TRAINING AND TESTS USED FOR PESTICIDE RE-CERTIFICATION ADDRESS MANY AREAS OF PEST MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION TO TESTS AND TRAINING, THESE STAKEHOLDERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS THAT COULD BE USED PRIOR TO RE-CERTIFICATION TESTING OR FIRST-TIME TESTING. FURTHERMORE, DOCUMENTS FOCUSED ON NOZZLE SELECTION, SPRAYER CALIBRATION, AND PESTICIDE SAFETY WOULD PROVIDE THESE STAKEHOLDERS WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION TO EFFECTIVELY APPLY THE PESTICIDES AND REMAIN SAFE.IN SD, WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV) IS THE MOSQUITO-VECTORED DISEASE OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE. THE FIRST HUMAN CASE OF WEST NILE VIRUS IN SD WAS REPORTED IN 2002, AND THE STATE HASONE OF THE HIGHEST ANNUAL PER CAPITA INFECTION RATES IN THE NATION. FROM 1999-2019, SD WAS ONE OF SEVEN STATES THAT HAD AN AVERAGE ANNUAL INCIDENCE OF REPORTED WNV THAT WAS GREATER THAN 1 PER 100,000 RESIDENTS (CDC ARBONET). IN SD, COMMUNITY MOSQUITO ABATEMENT PROGRAMS ARE LOCALLY FUNDED WITH SOME SUPPORT FROM STATE GRANTS VIA THE SD DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (DOH). MOSQUITO CONTROL IN MUCH OF SD IS FOCUSED ON ADULT ABATEMENT PROGRAMS USING INSECTICIDE APPLICATIONS. THESE TREATMENTS ARE NOT HIGHLY REGARDED BY ALL CITIZENS AND SOME IN THE METRO AREAS WOULD PREFER TO OPT OUT OF CITY-WIDE ABATEMENT PROGRAMS. MOREOVER, DUNBAR ET AL (2018) FOUND EVIDENCE OF REDUCED INSECTICIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY IN POPULATIONS OF AEDES VEXANS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN SD. THIS IS POTENTIALLY DUE TO THE OVERLAP IN INSECTICIDE CHEMISTRY THAT IS USED FOR AGRICULTURAL PEST MANAGEMENT AND MOSQUITO ABATEMENT PROGRAMS (DUNBAR ET AL. 2018). THESE ISSUES INDICATE THAT ADDITIONAL EXTENSION PROGRAMMING IS NECESSARY TO EDUCATE SD STAKEHOLDERS ON HOW TO AVOID WEST NILE VIRUS INFECTIONS AND HOW TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MOSQUITOS USING IPM. STAKEHOLDERS IN SD ARE ALSO FACED WITH TICKS AND ASSOCIATED DISEASES. SDIPM WILL DEVELOP IDENTIFICATION GUIDES AND MATERIALS TO PROMOTE TICK AVOIDANCE AND INFORMATION FOR HOW TO HANDLE TICK BITES.ANNUALLY, THE SDSU PLANT DIAGNOSTIC CLINIC (PDC) RECEIVES APPROXIMATELY 1,200 SAMPLES. MOST OF THESE SAMPLES ARE DELIVERED DURING THE GROWING SEASON AND ORIGINATE FROM THE MAJOR AGRONOMIC CROPS. SUBMISSIONS INCLUDE SUSPECTED DISEASED PLANTS, INSECT SPECIMENS, WEEDS, AND SOIL SAMPLES. THE PDC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING THE CAUSAL ORGANISMS FOR PLANTS EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS, AND CONTACTS AGRONOMY EXTENSION SPECIALISTS WHEN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE REQUIRED FOR IDENTIFICATION OF INSECTS, WEEDS, DISEASES, OR HERBICIDE TOXICITY SYMPTOMS IN CROP TISSUES. THE PDC IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF IPM IN SD, AS ACCURATE AND TIMELY IDENTIFICATION OF PESTS IS CRUCIAL FOR MANAGEMENT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH PLANT SAMPLE DIAGNOSIS IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT THAT IS REQUIRED TO DIAGNOSE PLANT DISEASES USING THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF PLATING SAMPLES FROM SYMPTOMATIC TISSUES. THIS TECHNIQUE CAN DELAY IDENTIFICATION, AS SOME PATHOGENS REQUIRE 3-4 WEEKS TO SUCCESSFULLY GROW ON THE PROVIDED MEDIA. THE DELAYED IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTS TO THE STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THE DISEASE CAN RESULT IN THE OCCURRENCE ECONOMICALLY DAMAGING DISEASE OUTBREAKS. MOREOVER, SOME PATHOGENS SUCH AS VIRUSES AND OBLIGATE BIOTROPHS CAN&#39;T BE CULTURED ON MEDIA. TO REDUCE THE TIME FROM SAMPLE DROP OFF TO DISEASE IDENTIFICATION, THE SDSU PDC IS CURRENTLY USING SEQUENCE-BASED DIAGNOSIS TO IDENTIFY SAMPLES. ALTHOUGH THIS METHOD ALLOWS FOR MORE RAPID IDENTIFICATION AND RESPONSE FOR DIAGNOSING PLANT PATHOGENS, IT IS ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e4dcf3ad-0730-1e57-249e-8c0f96bb1f40-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20217000635474_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 138710345, "Award ID": "20217000635473", "Award Amount": 675000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-20", "CFDA Number": "10.329", "Description": "THIS IS AN EIP PROJECT.

INCREASED DEMAND FOR LOCAL PRODUCE HAS ALSO LED TO A SHIFT IN HIGH VALUE VEGETABLE PRODUCTION FROM OPENFIELDS TO PROTECTED CULTURE. IN ADDITION, CLIMATE DISRUPTIONS HAVE MADE PROTECTED CULTURE DESIRABLE AS A MEANS OF ESCAPING FOLIAR BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL DISEASES INTENSIFIED BY RAIN. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR TOMATOES TO BE PRODUCED IN THE SAME HT EACH YEAR FOR 5 YEARS OR MORE. MANY GROWERS HAVE INTENSIFIED PRODUCTION AND ADDED FEATURES, SUCH AS HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEMS, THAT MAKE THE TUNNELS DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO MOVE. THE RESULTING LIMITED ROTATIONS HAVE CAUSED SOILBORNE PATHOGEN POPULATIONS TO BUILD UP, AND YIELD AND FRUIT QUALITY ARE GREATLY REDUCED. SOILBORNE DISEASES THREATEN THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF TOMATO PRODUCTION IN HTS IF LEFT UNCHECKED.

BECAUSE VIRUSES CAN BE SPREAD VERTICALLY FROM QUEEN TO OFFSPRING AS WELL AS HORIZONTALLY BY MITE VECTORING, THIS ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY IS ALSO CRITICAL TO MAXIMIZE ANY VARROA IPM APPROACH.

RESULTS FROM THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE THAT WILL TEST OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO IPM RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN BE USED IF PESTS ARE FOUND IN HOMES. RESEARCH RESULTS FROM THIS PROJECT AND EXISTING PUBLICATIONS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION DELIVERABLES ACCESSIBLE ON STATE AND EXTENSION WEBSITES. DELIVERABLES WILL INCLUDE HOMEOWNER-FRIENDLY RECOMMENDATIONS, AND UP TO SIX, 1-2 MINUTE VIDEOS ON IPM, EXCLUSION, PREVENTION, AND COMMON PESTS. IN WORKING WITH NON-TRADITIONAL EXTENSION PROGRAMMING, WE WILL ALSO EXPAND EXTENSION&#39;S CAPACITY BY PROVIDING IN-SERVICE TRAINING TO AGENTS. WE WILL ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND SCALABILITY OF TRAINING BY PROVIDING A RESOURCE BINDER AND PRESENTATIONS WHICH INCLUDES POST-TRAINING EVALUATION TOOLS ALREADY DEVELOPED. WE WILL SET A BASELINE OF CONSUMER IPM KNOWLEDGE AND PESTICIDE USE VIA SURVEY TO TRACK THE OUTCOMES.THE ULTIMATE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO 1) CREATE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF IPM; 2) INCREASE ADOPTION OF SCIENCE-BASED PEST MANAGEMENT IN HOMES RATHER THAN SELECTING CONTROL METHODS BASED ON ADVERTISING; 3) INCREASE AGENT PARTICIPATION TO SUPPORT HOMEOWNER IPM AND BUILD EXTENSION&#39;S CAPACITY BY ENGAGING NON-TRADITIONAL CHANGE AGENTS WHO WILL THEN REACH A MORE DIVERSIFIED AUDIENCE. INCREASED PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OF IPM CAN ALLOW FOR FEWER PESTICIDE EXPOSURES, BETTER MANAGEMENT OF PESTS, AND THE REDUCTION OF PESTS IN HOMES. IF PESTS ARE BETTER CONTROLLED IN HOMES, PEST PRESENCE IN PUBLIC PLACES SUCH AS SCHOOLS MAY ALSO BE DECREASED. IPM CAN DELAY THE ONSET OF INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE THAT WILL PRESERVE THE USEFUL LIFE OF ACTIVE INGREDIENTS, PRESERVE BENEFICIAL INSECTS, AND DECREASE HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE TO UNNECESSARY PESTICIDE USE. PEST EXCLUSION AND PREVENTION PRACTICED BY HOMEOWNERS WILL ALSO ASSIST THE PEST CONTROL INDUSTRY IN FULLY PRACTICING IPM.

A 7-YEAR AVERAGE (2009-2015) COTTON PRODUCTION STATISTIC SHOWS THAT APPROXIMATELY 55% OF UNITED STATES COTTON IS PRODUCED IN TEXAS, WHILE 69% OF TEXAS COTTON IS PRODUCED IN THE HIGH PLAINS REGION OF TEXAS. THESE DATA INDICATE THAT 38% OF U.S. COTTON IS PRODUCED IN THE HIGH PLAINS, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE MOST CONCENTRATED AREA OF COTTON PRODUCTION IN THE WORLD. DECLINING WATER AVAILABILITY FROM THE OGALLALA AQUIFER MEANS THAT THE CURRENT COTTON PRODUCTION IS LARGELY CHARACTERIZED AS EITHER LIMITED-IRRIGATION OR DRYLAND. AS SUCH, COTTON IN THP MAY RECEIVE SOME IRRIGATION, BUT MAY EXPERIENCE VARIABLE PERIODS OF DROUGHT STRESS.SOUTHERN GEORGIA IS ALSO A CONCENTRATED COTTON REGION WITH 60% OF GEORGIA COTTON ACREAGE IN THE COASTAL PLAIN, WHICH RESEMBLES THE TEXAS HIGH PLAINS IN TERMS OF COTTON PEST MANAGEMENT ISSUES, DECLINING WATER AVAILABILITY, AND COTTON PRODUCTION PROFITABILITY.

IPM FACULTY USE TWITTER/FACEBOOK TO REACH STAKEHOLDERS QUICKLY AND INCREASE EXCHANGE AMONG USERS.ANIMAL IPMCATTLE AND POULTRY ARE THE TOP LIVESTOCK COMMODITIES IN ARKANSAS. ARKANSAS IS HOME TO APPROXIMATELY 26,000 CATTLE OPERATIONS, OF WHICH 24,000 OPERATORS HAD &LT;100 HEAD OF CATTLE. AS OF JAN. 1, 2017, THE STATE HAD 1.75 MILLION HEAD OF CATTLE. TO SUPPORT THIS HERD, ARKANSAS USES 1.29 MILLION ACRES OF FORAGE LAND TO PRODUCE HAY AND HAYLAGE, GRASS SILAGE, AND GREENCHOP. ARKANSAS&#39; POULTRY MARKET IS VALUED AT $198.5 BILLION. ARKANSAS CATTLE GROWERS AND POULTRY INTEGRATORS RELY ON RESEARCH-BASED IPM INFORMATION AND STRATEGIES, WHETHER TO CONTROL PESTS DIRECTLY ON THE CATTLE, PESTS OF PASTURE OR POULTRY PESTS. THE ANIMAL IPM PROGRAM PARTNERS EXTENSION AND RESEARCH FACULTY WITH COUNTY AGENTS TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER INFORMATION TO GROWERS, CONSULTANTS, AND INDUSTRY.

INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE, IMPROPER TIMING ON INSECTICIDE EAR TAG APPLICATION AND LACK OF INSECTICIDE CLASS ROTATION ROUTINELY RESULT IN FLY CONTROL FAILURES. INSECTICIDAL EAR TAGS, INSECTICIDE SPRAYS, INSECTICIDE SELF-TREATMENT DEVICES, OR FEED-THROUGH INSECT GROWTH REGULATORS ARE THE MOST COMMON METHODS. OTHER METHODS (WALK-THROUGH TRAPS AND REPELLENTS) ARE APPROPRIATE FOR PRODUCERS DESIRING ALTERNATIVES. PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN ARKANSAS HAS SHOWN UP TO 70% HORN FLY CONTROL WITH THE BRUCE TRAP, AND HAS IDENTIFIED EFFECTIVE SHORT-TERM REPELLENTS.IMPORTED FIRE ANTS, ARMYWORMS, GRASSHOPPERS AND BERMUDAGRASS STEM MAGGOTS ARE AMONG THE IMPORTANT FORAGE PESTS FOR LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS IN ARKANSAS. IMPORTED FIRE ANTS (SOLENOPSIS INVICTA AND S. RICHTERI) INFEST 56 OF 75 ARKANSAS COUNTIES AND CA. 39 ARKANSAS COUNTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE FEDERAL IMPORTED FIRE ANT QUARANTINE. THIS QUARANTINE RESTRICTS MOVEMENT OF IMPROPERLY STORED HAY FROM QUARANTINED TO NON-QUARANTINED AREAS WHICH RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT HAY SHORTAGE ISSUES DURING PERIODS OF DROUGHT. FALL ARMYWORMS CAUSE FORAGE LOSSES EACH YEAR IN ARKANSAS, WHEREAS INFESTATIONS OF TRUE ARMYWORM AND GRASSHOPPER ARE MORE SPORADIC. IN 2016, FALL ARMY-WORM INFESTATIONS WERE SEVERE, WIDESPREAD AND OF OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS IN ARKANSAS. NUMEROUS PRODUCERS USING SHORT-LIVED PYRETHROIDS MADE THREE APPLICATION TO MAKE A BERMUDAGRASS HAY CROP AND MANY THAT DID NOT SCOUT SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT YIELD LOSSES. IN 2013, BERMUDAGRASS STEM MAGGOT (BSM, AN EXOTIC PEST FROM SOUTH ASIA) WAS IDENTIFIED IN ARKANSAS. SINCE 2013, THE BSM RANGE HAS EXPANDED AND PRODUCERS HAVE BECOME MORE AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE AND YIELD LOSSES.IMPORTED FIRE ANTS CAN BE MANAGED USING BAITS, BUT THIS METHOD IS NOT FEASIBLE FOR VAST AREAS. IN ARKANSAS, FOUR SPECIES OF PSEUDACTEON (PHORIDAE) FLIES HAVE BEEN RELEASED FOR BIOLOGICAL CONTROL, AND TWO ARE ESTABLISHED.SPECIALTY CROP IPMSPECIALTY CROP PRODUCTION INCLUDING FRUIT, VEGETABLES, AND PECANS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF ARKANSAS&#39; STATE ECONOMY, AND ALSO ADDS DIVERSIFY TO THE AGRICULTURE OF THE STATE. THE VALUE OF FRUIT AND NUTS PRODUCED IN ARKANSAS WAS $15.6 MILLION, AND CROPS AND THEIR ACREAGE INCLUDED PECANS (10,700 A), PEACHES (550 A), GRAPES (700 A), BLUEBERRIES (280 A), BLACKBERRIES AND RASPBERRIES (200 A), AND STRAWBERRIES (200 A). VEGETABLE PRODUCTION IS WORTH OVER 35 MILLION INCLUDING SWEET POTATO, WATERMELON, AND TOMATO BRINGING IN THE MOST REVENUE. PRODUCTION OF SPECIALTY CROPS HAS INCREASED RECENTLY, DUE TO INTEREST IN LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCE AND LOCAL MARKETS. THIS HAS RESULTED NOT ONLY IN AN INCREASE OF SPECIALTY CROP PRODUCTION, BUT ALSO AN INCREASE IN ORGANIC PRODUCTION, WITH TOTAL REVENUE AROUND $300 THOUSAND IN 2015, COMPARED TO ZERO ORGANIC REVENUE REPORTED IN 2014 OR BEFORE.EACH SPECIALTY CROP GROWN IN ARKANSAS IS LIMITED BY PEST PROBLEMS INCLUDING INSECTS, WEEDS, AND HIGH DISEASE PRESSURE DUE TO OUR WARM HUMID CLIMATE. THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED BY APPLIED RESEARCH AND EXTENSION EFFORTS IN WHICH UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS PLAYS A LARGE ROLE. THIS ENSURES THAT GROWERS HAVE UP TO DATE KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNIQUES TO PRODUCE SPECIALTY CROPS IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE. IT IS IMPORTANT IN ARKANSAS FOR RESEARCH AND EXTENSION EFFORTS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO EXPAND THIS MARKET WHILE DEMAND IS INCREASING. TO DO SO, WE MUST TACKLE ISSUES THAT ARE LARGE FACTORS IN LIMITING PRODUCTION OF SPECIALTY CROPS IN OUR STATE BY UTILIZING INTEGRATED TACTICS THAT ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE. ARKANSAS RESEARCH ON FRUIT PESTS HAS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING TRAPS, SCOUTING METHODS, DEGREE-DAY MODELS, AND EVALUATING LOW RISK ALTERNATIVES TO SYNTHETIC INSECTICIDES TO MINIMIZE PEST DAMAGE.ARKANSAS HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO INCREASE PRODUCTION OF SPECIALTY CROPS. THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE IS KNOWN FOR RICH SANDY SOILS THAT ARE IDEAL FOR SPECIALTY CROP PRODUCTION. THIS REGION IS KNOWN AS THE DELTA. AS ROW CROP PRICES FALL, MORE ROW CROP GROWERS ARE DIVERSIFYING THEIR PRODUCTION TO INCLUDE LARGER ACRES OF SPECIALTY CROPS INCLUDING PEPPERS, SQUASH, CANTALOUPE, WATERMELON, AND PUMPKIN. TO SUPPORT OUR EXPANDING MARKET, WE MUST EVALUATE NEW METHODS TO HELP MANAGE OUR HIGH PEST PRESSURE TO COMPETE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET.IPM FOR POLLINATOR HEALTHPOLLINATORS ARE IMPORTANT TO ARKANSAS ECONOMY. ARKANSAS FARMS PRODUCE OVER 20,000 ACRES OF ORCHARD CROPS, MELONS, BERRIES AND VEGETABLES. THIS PRODUCE TENDS TO BE SMALL-ACREAGE, HIGH-VALUE CROPS COMPARED WITH OTHER COMMODITIES. THE VALUE OF THESE TO ARKANSAS AGRICULTURE IS OVER $50 MILLION EACH YEAR. MOST FRUITS AND MANY VEGETABLES DEPEND ON INSECT POLLINATION TO ENSURE HIGHER YIELD AND HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCE. HONEY BEES ARE THE MOST COMMONLY USED INSECT POLLINATOR FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. HONEY BEES PROVIDE EXCELLENT POLLINATION, AND ALSO PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL CROP OF HONEY.IPM SUPPORT FOR PEST DIAGNOSTIC FACILITIESDIAGNOSTIC FACILITIES ARE CRITICAL TO SUPPORT IPM DECISION-MAKING IN THE FIELD, BY PROVIDING TIMELY AND CORRECT IDENTIFICATION. CORRECT IDENTIFICATION OF A PEST, DISEASEOR WEED IS THE UNDERLYING BASIS OF ANY IPM STRATEGY. MANY COMMON INSECTS, DISEASE SYMPTOMS OR WEEDS ARE READILY RECOGNIZED BY GROWERS, CONSULTANTS AND CROP SCOUTS. HOWEVER, EMERGING SPECIES OF CONCERN, SUCH AS EXOTIC INVADERS, CRYPTIC SPECIES THAT ARE PART OF A COMPLEX, OR SPECIES THAT ARE SELDOM SEEN OR USUALLY INNOCUOUS, REQUIRE IDENTIFICATION BY TRAINED SPECIALISTS. IN ADDITION, MANY SPECIES REQUIRING IDENTIFICATION ARE FOUND BY HOMEOWNERS, OF PESTS OR PLANT SYMPTOMS (CAUSED BY DISEASES OR INSECTS) IN HOME LANDSCAPES. SINCE 2010, THE EXTENSION DIAGNOSTIC CLINIC (THE PLANT HEALTH CLINIC) MADE 20,558 IDENTIFICATIONS - PRIMARILY OF DISEASE SAMPLES, BUT ALSO ARTHROPODS AND WEEDS.

THE GOALS OF THE IPM PROGRAM OF NORTH DAKOTA ARE TO COORDINATE IPM EXTENSION EDUCATION FOR AGRONOMIC CROPS, PROMOTE POLLINATOR HEALTH, SUPPORT THE NDSU PLANT DIAGNOSTIC LAB AND PROVIDE IPM TRAINING AS PART OF THE NDSU EXTENSION PESTICIDE APPLICATOR TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. OUR PROPOSED IPM ACTIVITIES SUPPORT THE NATIONAL IPM ROADMAP GOALS TO IMPROVE COST/BENEFIT ANALYSES IN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY PRODUCTION, AND TO REDUCE HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE TWO PRIMARY PRIORITY AREAS IN OUR PROPOSAL ARE 1) IPM IMPLEMENTATION IN AGRONOMIC CROPS (53% OF BUDGET) AND 2) IPM FOR POLLINATOR HEALTH (15% OF BUDGET). OUR PROPOSAL ALSO ADDRESSES TWO SECONDARY PRIORITIES: 1) IPM SUPPORT FOR PEST DIAGNOSTIC FACILITIES (18% OF BUDGET) AND 2) IPM EDUCATION FOR PESTICIDE APPLICATORS (7% OF BUDGET). EIP COORDINATION PLANNING WILL BE 8% OF THE TOTAL BUDGET. FOR IPM IMPLEMENTATION IN AGRONOMIC CROPS, FOUR MAJOR CROPS (WHEAT, BARLEY, SOYBEAN, SUNFLOWER) WILL BE SURVEYED FOR MAJOR INSECT PEST AND DISEASE PROBLEMS, AND INFORMATION ON PEST DENSITIES AND IPM STRATEGIES WILL BE PROVIDED TO PRODUCERS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL STAKEHOLDERS. THIS PROGRAM SUPPORTS THE CPPM FOCUS AREAS OF PLANT PROTECTION TACTICS AND TOOLS, AND ENHANCING AGRICULTURAL BIOSECURITY. FOR IPM FOR POLLINATOR HEALTH, POLLINATOR GARDENS AND OUTREACH WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT NORTH DAKOTA IN COOPERATION WITH THE NDSU EXTENSION SERVICE COUNTY AGENTS AND MASTER GARDENERS. THIS PROGRAM AREA WILL INCLUDE FIELD DEMONSTRATIONS OF GARDENING FOR POLLINATORS AND CREATION OF CERTIFIED POLLINATOR GARDENS, WHICH WILL INCREASE KNOWLEDGE OF POLLINATOR FRIENDLY IPM PRACTICES. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE POLLINATOR HEALTH OBJECTIVE IS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE PLANTS FOR POLLINATORS ACROSS THE STATE AND THEREBY IMPROVE POLLINATOR HEALTH. THE PROPOSED POLLINATOR HEALTH PROGRAM SUPPORTS THE CPPM FOCUS AREA OF IPM FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. THE NDSU PLANT DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY (PDL) RECEIVES AND PROCESSES 3,000 TO 5,000 SAMPLESEACH YEAR RANGING FROM PLANT PATHOGENS, INSECTS, AND WEEDS TO ABIOTIC PROBLEMS. THE PDL ALSO PROCESSES SAMPLES OF REGULATORY CONCERN FOR SEED HEALTH AND PHYTOSANITARY CERTIFICATION, WHICH ENABLES TRADE OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES AND SUPPORTS THE ECONOMIC HEALTH OF NORTH DAKOTA. IPM INFORMATION IS PROVIDED WITH EACH DIAGNOSIS (AS APPLICABLE) TO ENCOURAGE STAKEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATION OF SUSTAINABLE IPM PRACTICES. THE PDL ALSO GENERATES AN ANNUAL REPORT SUMMARIZING LAB ACTIVITIES AND IMPACTS. THE ADDITION OF A DEDICATED INSECT DIAGNOSTICIAN ASSIGNED TO THE PDL WILL RELIEVE THE INSECT IDENTIFICATION BURDEN ON SHORT-STAFFED AND TIME CONSTRAINED EXTENSION ENTOMOLOGY, AND STRENGTHEN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PDL. THE PROPOSED SUPPORT FOR THE PDL SUPPORTS THE CPPM FOCUS AREA OF ENHANCING AGRICULTURAL BIOSECURITY. NORTH DAKOTA CURRENTLY HAS 6,153 CERTIFIED COMMERCIAL/PUBLIC PESTICIDE APPLICATORS, AND 11,473 CERTIFIED PRIVATE PESTICIDE APPLICATORS. RENEWAL IS MANDATORY EVERY THREE YEARS. THE NDSU EXTENSION PESTICIDE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM PROVIDES PESTICIDE SAFETY EDUCATION, TRAINING, CERTIFICATION AND RECERTIFICATION TO APPROXIMATELY 2,000 COMMERCIAL/PUBLIC APPLICATORS AND 3,500 PRIVATE APPLICATORS ANNUALLY. COMMERCIAL/PUBLIC APPLICATOR TRAINING IS PROVIDED AT 12 LARGE VENUES STATEWIDE DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, AND PRIVATE APPLICATOR TRAINING IS PROVIDED BY COUNTY EXTENSION AGENTS AT ABOUT 120 SMALLER COUNTY VENUES. WE PROPOSE TO INCLUDE INTERACTIVE IPM EDUCATION IN OUR PESTICIDE TRAINING PROGRAM TO PROMOTE IPM ADOPTION AND PRACTICE AMONG CERTIFIED PESTICIDE APPLICATORS. THIS PROGRAM AREA SUPPORTS THE CPPM FOCUS AREAS OF PLANT PROTECTION TACTICS AND TOOLS, AND ENHANCING AGRICULTURAL BIOSECURITY.STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THE NDSU EXTENSION SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE OF STATE EXTENSION SPECIALISTS BASED ON THE NDSU CAMPUS, REGIONAL SPECIALISTS AT SEVEN RESEARCH EXTENSION CENTERS AND COUNTY AGENTS SERVING ALL 53 NORTH DAKOTA COUNTIES PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT FRAMEWORK FOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. CROP PRODUCERS, CROP CONSULTANTS, COMMODITY GROUP BOARDS, OTHER AG INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS, NORTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE STAFF, USDA APHIS STAFF, MASTER GARDENERS, URBAN FORESTRY PROFESSIONALS, AND HOMEOWNERS COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY TO EXTENSION SPECIALISTS AND COUNTY AGENTS. SPECIALISTS AND COUNTY AGENTS COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THROUGH NEWSLETTERS, CALLS, RADIO AND SOCIAL MEDIA.
