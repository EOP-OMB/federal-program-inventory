CONTROL ACT (TCA) GAVE THE FDA AUTHORITY TO REGULATE TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH BUT INITIALLY EXTENDED ONLY TO CIGARETTES. BY THE TIME OTHER PRODUCTS WERE DEEMED UNDER FDA AUTHORITY IN 2016, THE TOBACCO LANDSCAPE HAD CHANGED DRAMATICALLY, MAKING MODERN TOBACCO SURVEILLANCE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. UNFORTUNATELY, THE CIGARETTE-CENTRIC TOBACCO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS IN THE US HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND TO THESE CHANGES. EVEN AFTER FORMAL CALLS FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN SMOKELESS TOBACCO AND CIGAR MEASUREMENT MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO, STANDARDIZED MEASURES OF THESE PRODUCTS REMAIN SPARSE AND INSUFFICIENT. MOREOVER, DESPITE NUMEROUS EARLY WARNING SIGNALS, QUESTIONS ABOUT JUUL DID NOT APPEAR ON MAJOR NATIONAL SURVEYS SUCH AS NATIONAL YOUTH TOBACCO SURVEY UNTIL 2019, TWO FULL YEARS AFTER IT BECAME THE TOP- SELLING ENDS BRAND ON THE MARKET AND ENDS USE AMONG YOUTH HAD REACHED CONCERNING LEVELS. INDEED, RAPID ASSESSMENT AND RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE TOBACCO MARKET ARE ESSENTIAL TO INFORMING AND EVALUATING FDA\u2019S CURRENT AND PENDING REGULATORY ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSED PRODUCT STANDARDS (E.G., BANNING MENTHOL), PENDING MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR E-CIGARETTES, AND THE MODIFIED RISK TOBACCO PRODUCTS (MRTPS) PATHWAY. THEREFORE, INFORMED BY A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK WHICH DRAWS UPON A TRADITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS FDA\u2019S SENTINEL INITIATIVE, THIS U01 PROPOSAL ASSEMBLES A LARGE COLLABORATIVE NETWORK, WHICH INCLUDES A NETWORK OF SIX SENTINEL STATES THAT TRIANGULATES MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES TO ESTABLISH THE CENTER FOR RAPID SURVEILLANCE OF TOBACCO (CRST). THE CRST AIMS TO PERFORM RAPID SURVEILLANCE OF: 1) TOBACCO PRODUCT MARKETING, TO GENERATE SIGNALS OF INTEREST; 2) THE TOBACCO PRODUCT MARKETPLACE, TO GENERATE AND REFINE SIGNALS OF INTEREST; AND 3) CHANGES IN TOBACCO PRODUCT USE BEHAVIORS, TO GENERATE, REFINE, AND EVALUATE SIGNALS OF INTEREST. WE WILL IMPLEMENT AN OPTIMAL RAPID SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM OF TOBACCO THAT WILL ENHANCE FDA\u2019S REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS USING A RANGE OF METHODS AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO RAPIDLY ASSESS MEANINGFUL CHANGES IN TOBACCO MARKETING, THE TOBACCO MARKETPLACE, AND TOBACCO USE. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED HAS DEEP EXPERIENCE WITH TOBACCO REGULATORY SCIENCE, SURVEILLANCE AND ANALYSES OF THESE DATA. WE ALSO HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE OVERSEEING MULTI-SITE PROJECTS IN COLLABORATION WITH FEDERAL PARTNERS THAT SUPPORT OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF CRST. OUR ONGOING ENGAGEMENT WITH FDA CTP, FEDERAL PARTNERS, AND CASEL AND DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF FDA\u2019S REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND PROCESSES ENSURE THAT WE WILL NOT ONLY CONDUCT RAPID SURVEILLANCE, BUT ANTICIPATE CHANGES IN THE MARKET VIA EARLY SIGNAL DETECTION, AND DELIVER MEANINGFUL DATA TO INFORM FDA\u2019S ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT A SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT. IN DOING SO, WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW PARADIGM OF TOBACCO SURVEILLANCE, SERVE AS A RESOURCE ON SURVEILLANCE METHODS AND MEASURES, SUPPORT EVOLUTIONS IN TRADITIONAL SURVEILLANCE MEASURES, AND MEANINGFULLY ADVANCE THE FIELD OF TOBACCO REGULATORY SCIENCE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NJ", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f360f59f-4329-903a-affb-d7870b1503be-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01CA278695_7529"}, {"internal_id": 162138291, "Award ID": "R56ES034792", "Award Amount": 669321.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-08-15", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES: EMERGING INGREDIENTS, ACIDS, TOXICANTS, AND INDICATORS OF NON-TOBACCO NICOTINE - CONTINUING CHANGE IN BOTH ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE (EC) AEROSOLIZATION DEVICE DESIGN AND THE CHEMISTRY OF THE E- LIQUIDS THAT ARE VAPED HAS COMPLICATED REGULATION AS WELL AS PROMOTED USE PREVALENCE AT ALL AGES. OUR CHEMI- CAL / TOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE E-LIQUIDS. THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN E-LIQUID CHEMISTRY INCLUDE THE USE OF MANY EMERGING INGREDIENTS (EIS). THESE INCLUDE: A) NON- CONFECTIONARY COOLING AGENTS (E.G., THE WILKINSON SWORD \u201cWS\u201d CHEMICALS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR USE IN SHAVING CREAMS); B) ACIDS TO PROTONATE FREE-BASE NICOTINE TO ALLOW HIGH NICOTINE PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT HARSH UPON INHALA- TION (E.G., JUULTM); C) SYNTHETIC NICOTINE RATHER THAN TOBACCO NICOTINE (AS INSPIRED BY MANUFACTURER HOPES OF EVADING U.S. REGULATION AS \u201cTOBACCO PRODUCTS\u201d), AND 4) SWEET AND FRUITY FLAVOR CHEMICALS (AS STEALTH INGREDIENTS IN NON-REGULATED \u201cTOBACCO\u201d-FLAVORED PRODUCTS). INGREDIENT CHANGES ARE OCCURRING QUICKLY AND CONSTANTLY. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR WORK THAT TRACKS THESE CHANGES AND DETERMINES THEIR TOXICOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS. IN AIM 1, 600 COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS WILL BE ANALYZED IN A BROAD MARKET SURVEY TO DETERMINE: A) THE FLAVOR CHEMICALS ON OUR TARGET ANALYTE LIST (183 COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING FOUR WORRISOME EI CHEMICALS IN THE WS CLASS) PLUS ANY EIS AT >20 G/ML; B) BOTH THE S AND R NICOTINE FORMS PLUS THREE OTHER TOBACCO ALKALOIDS (E.G., NORNICOTINE, WHICH IS A PRECURSOR FOR THE POTENT CARCINOGEN NNN) AS INDICATORS OF USE OF NATURAL / SYNTHETIC NICOTINE; AND C) ACID ADDI- TIVES.

TOXIC EFFECTS WILL BE IDENTIFIED USING PROTEOMIC TISSUE ANALYSES AND CONFIRMED USING RELEVANT MODE-OF ACTION ASSAYS (E.G., INFLAMMATORY AND OXIDA- TIVE STRESS RESPONSES). MARGIN OF EXPOSURE (MOE) ANALYSES WILL BE CARRIED OUT FOR EACH CHEMICAL TESTED TO FLAG HEALTH EFFECTS INCLUDING CANCER RISK. FOR AIM 3, WE WILL CARRY OUT THE SECOND TOXICOLOGY EFFORT, REPEATING THE WORK OF AIM 2 BUT WITH HEATING USING RELEVANT EC HEAT LEVELS DURING AEROSOL PRODUCTION. COMMERCIAL E-LIQUID PRODUCTS WILL ALSO BE TESTED. ALL EXPOSURES WILL BE DONE AT THE ALI USING A CULTEX SYSTEM AND 3D EPIAIRWAY TISSUE. OVERALL, THE STUDY WILL REVEAL THE TOXICITY IMPLICATIONS OF NEW INGREDIENT CHEMICALS IN THE HIGHLY VARIABLE / CHANGING EC MARKETPLACE. THE RESULTS WILL REVEAL IF THE EC LEVELS OF THESE CHEMICALS ARE TOXIC IN 3D CULTURES OF HUMAN RESPIRATORY TISSUES AND HOW THESE TISSUES RESPOND TO EXPOSURE.

E-CIGARETTES AND HOOKAH ARE NOW DOMINANT FEATURES OF THE CURRENT TOBACCO MARKETPLACE, AND THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HARM THE HEALTH OF USERS IN WAYS SIMILAR TO CIGARETTES. THEREFORE, ESTIMATING THE AGE OF ASTHMA ONSET TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF PAST 30-DAY E-CIGARETTE AND HOOKAH USE AMONG NEVER CIGARETTE USERS IS PARAMOUNT TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH, EDUCATE THE PUBLIC, AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA). INFORMATION ON AN EARLIER AGE OF ASTHMA ONSET WILL QUANTIFY AND DISPLAY THE POTENTIAL RISK OF THESE TOBACCO PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN HELP PREVENT PEOPLE FROM INITIATING USE OR MOTIVATE USERS TO QUIT. IN ADDITION, THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO CONTROL AND TREAT ASTHMA IS WITH EARLY DETECTION OF THE DISEASE.

CHRONIC TOBACCO USE IS THE LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN THE U.S. WHILE A LARGE BODY OF WORK HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED ON THE EFFECTS OF CIGARETTE SMOKING VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF SWITCHING TO RECENTLY POPULARIZED ELECTRONIC NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEMS (ENDS). THESE PRODUCTS PRODUCE FEWER AND REDUCED TOXIC BYPRODUCTS AND ARE PROMOTED AS SAFER ALTERNATIVES TO SMOKING. WHETHER THESE REDUCTIONS IN HARMFUL CHEMICAL CONTENTS LEAD TO REDUCED AIRWAY TOXICITY EFFECTS ON A BACKGROUND OF A CIGARETTE SMOKING HISTORY IS THE FOCUS OF OUR STUDY. OUR PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS UTILIZE AIRWAY SECRETION SAMPLES OF ENDS USERS THAT SWITCHED FROM CIGARETTE SMOKING, SMOKERS, NEVER SMOKERS AND FORMER SMOKERS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF PRODUCT USE TRANSITION. THIS ASSESSMENT WILL BE BASED ON SOME ESTABLISHED PROTEIN BIOMARKER OUTCOMES, AND WITH THE POTENTIAL TO IDENTIFY NOVEL TRANSITION SPECIFIC BIOMARKERS. IN FACT, ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES SHOWED THAT CURRENT ENDS USERS THAT HAD GIVEN UP SMOKING MORE THAN 6 MONTHS PRIOR, DISPLAYED A UNIQUE PROTEOME COMPOSITION IN SPUTUM SAMPLES WHEN COMPARED TO SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS, POINTING TO HIGHER RATES OF NEUTROPHIL CELL DEATH.

PROJECT SUMMARY TITLE: EXOSOMAL EPIGENETIC BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH FLAVORED ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE USE IN ADULTS THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES TWO SCIENTIFIC INTEREST AREAS AS DEFINED IN RFA-OD-19-021: 1) UTILIZE BOTH BLOOD AND URINE SPECIMENS TO ANALYZE BIOMARKERS OF TOBACCO EXPOSURE NOT CURRENTLY MEASURED BY OTHER NATIONAL STUDIES; 2) EXAMINE DIFFERENCES IN EXOSOMAL EPIGENETIC BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS. E-CIGARETTE, A HANDHELD ELECTRONIC DEVICE SIMULATING THE FEELING OF TOBACCO SMOKING, GAINS GLOBAL POPULARITY DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS ESPECIALLY IN YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS, LARGELY DUE TO VARIOUS E-LIQUID FLAVORS. HOWEVER, THE HEALTH RISKS OF E-CIGARETTE USE, ESPECIALLY LONG-TERM HEALTH RISKS, ARE UNCLEAR. E-LIQUID USUALLY CONTAINS PROPYLENE GLYCOL AND/OR VEGETABLE GLYCERIN AS WELL AS NICOTINE AND FLAVORING CHEMICALS. OUR PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON LUNG EPITHELIAL CELLS AND MONOCYTES EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT FLAVORING CHEMICALS OR E-CIGARETTE FLAVORS WITHOUT NICOTINE HAVE SHOWN DIFFERENT CYTOTOXICITY. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN EXOSOMAL EPIGENETIC BIOMARKERS (MICRORNAS AND LONG NON-CODING RNAS) BETWEEN NON-USERS AND E-CIGARETTE USERS USING HUMAN PLASMA SAMPLES. HOWEVER, HOW E-LIQUID FLAVORS (FLAVORING CHEMICALS) LEAD TO THE CHANGES IN EXOSOMAL EPIGENETIC BIOMARKERS DURING THE E-CIGARETTE INITIATION, EXPOSURE, AND CESSATION IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. CONSIDERING THE CRUCIAL REGULATORY FUNCTIONS OF MICORNAS AND LONG NON-CODING RNAS AND THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH DISEASES, IT IS CRITICAL TO EVALUATE THEIR CHANGES AND ASSOCIATED BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS DURING THE FLAVORED E-CIGARETTE INITIATION, EXPOSURE AND CESSATION TO HELP UNDERSTAND HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH E-CIGARETTE USE. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY EXOSOMAL EPIGENETIC BIOMARKERS (INCLUDING MICRORNAS AND LONG NON-CODING RNAS) ASSOCIATED WITH FLAVORED E-CIGARETTES. WE HAVE REQUESTED BOTH LONGITUDINAL URINE SPECIMENS (PATH WAVE 1 STUDY CONDUCTED FROM 2013 TO 2014 AND WAVE 2 STUDY CONDUCTED FROM 2014 TO 2015) AND CROSS-SECTIONAL BLOOD SPECIMEN (PATH WAVE 1 STUDY) FROM POPULATION ASSESSMENT OF TOBACCO AND HEALTH (PATH) STUDY BIOREPOSITORIES. THE SAMPLES ARE AVAILABLE FROM PATH BASED UPON THE BIOSPECIMEN AVAILABILITY REPORT (BAR ID: 2019-005-BAR-2) RECEIVED FROM PATH STUDY BIOSPECIMEN ACCESS PROGRAM. WE WILL LINK THESE BIOSPECIMENS WITH PATH SURVEY DATA THROUGH UNIQUE SUBJECT IDS.

QUITTING SMOKING CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE RISK OF DISEASE AND EARLY DEATH. HOWEVER, AFRICAN AMERICANS (AA) ARE LESS LIKELY TO QUIT SMOKING SUCCESSFULLY THAN ARE NON-HISPANIC WHITES, AND THEY ARE ALSO THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE MENTHOL CIGARETTES THAN WHITES. THERE IS A REMARKABLE VARIATION IN THE INCIDENCE OF LUNG CANCER DUE TO CIGARETTE SMOKING AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RISKS THAN WHITES AT LOWER LEVELS OF SMOKING. TOBACCO USE LANDSCAPE IS CHANGING AMONG U.S. ADULTS WITH AN ESTIMATED 4.5% OF ADULTS AGED 18 YEARS AND OLDER REPORTING CURRENT USE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES (EC). EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT E-CIGARETTE AEROSOL IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS TOXIC THAN COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTE SMOKING, BUT E-CIGARETTE USE MAY ALSO POST ELEVATED RISK FOR FORMER SMOKERS TO RELAPSE BACK TO COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTE SMOKING.

ABOUT 13% OF YOUNG ADULTS 18-24 YEARS OLD CURRENTLY SMOKE CIGARILLOS COMPARED TO 3.2% OF ADULTS > 25 YEARS OF AGE. CIGARILLOS EXPOSE YOUNG ADULTS TO COMPARABLE OR HIGHER LEVELS OF NICOTINE AND MANY OF THE SAME TOXICANTS AND CARCINOGENS AS COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES, MAKING CIGARILLO USE IN YOUNG ADULTS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN.

COMPARED TO OBSERVATIONAL SURVEY DATA, DCES HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF PROVIDING NIMBLE EVIDENCE ON EMERGING PRODUCTS WITH LOW PREVALENCE AND PREDICTING THE IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL POLICIES ON BEHAVIORS BEFORE THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED IN THE REAL WORLD. HOWEVER, THEIR POTENTIAL IN GUIDING AND DEFENDING FDA POLICIES HAS NOT BEEN FULLY REALIZED DUE TO SEVERAL METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES. THE FIRST CHALLENGE IS THE LACK OF CONSISTENCY IN TOBACCO DCE DESIGN AND REPORTING. RESEARCHERS OFTEN ADOPT DIFFERENT DESIGN FEATURES (E.G., WHETHER TO INCLUDE AN OPT-OUT OPTION) AND USE DIFFERENT MEASURES IN REPORTING, SUCH AS WILLINGNESS TO PAY (WTP) VS. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE SCORES. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REVIEW CURRENT PRACTICES, EXPLORE HOW TO SYNTHESIZE EXISTING DCE EVIDENCE, AND PROPOSE GUIDELINES FOR FUTURE DCE DESIGN AND REPORTING.

IN 2019, 32.7% OF ADOLESCENTS USED ELECTRONIC NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEMS (ENDS) AND 6.0% CIGARETTES, WITH OVER 70% USING A FLAVORED PRODUCT. AS EVIDENCE MOUNTS ON THE INCREASED RISK OF TRANSITIONING FROM ENDS TO CIGARETTES AND LONGER-TERM TOBACCO USE, INNOVATIVE POLICIES ARE NEEDED. RECENTLY, 7 STATES HAVE ENACTED BANS ON FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS. SIXTEEN STATES AND DC ENACTED STATE-WIDE TOBACCO 21 (T21) POLICIES PRIOR TO PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL T21 LAW IN DEC 2019. HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN NO EVALUATIONS OF STATE-WIDE FLAVOR RESTRICTIONS OR THE FEDERAL T21 LAW ON ADOLESCENT TOBACCO USE OVERALL NOR ON DISPARITIES IN USE.  THE OVERARCHING GOALS OF THE STUDY ARE TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF STATE FLAVOR RESTRICTIONS AND STATE AND FEDERAL T21 POLICIES ON DISPARITIES IN TOBACCO USE AMONG YOUTH AGED 14-24 YEARS. THE BEHAVIOR RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (BRFSS), AN ANNUAL PHONE-BASED SURVEY OF HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS AMONG ADULTS AGED 18+ YEARS FROM ALL 50 STATES AND DC, INTRODUCED QUESTIONS ON ENDS IN 2016. THE YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY (YRBS), A BIENNIAL SCHOOL-BASED SURVEY OF HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS FROM 44 STATES, INTRODUCED QUESTIONS ON ENDS IN 2015. DIFFERENCES IN STATE TOBACCO CONTROL POLICIES CREATE A NATURAL EXPERIMENT, ALLOWING US TO EVALUATE THEIR EFFECTS USING THESE REPRESENTATIVE DATASETS.  THIS PROJECT HAS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF FLAVOR RESTRICTIONS AND T21 POLICIES ON TOBACCO USE (CIGARETTES, ENDS, SMOKELESS TOBACCO) ACROSS AGE (18-20-YEAR-OLDS VERSUS 21-24- YEAR-OLDS) IN THE BRFSS AS WELL AS EXAMINE THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF BOTH TOBACCO POLICIES ON TOBACCO USE ACROSS SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC STRATA. IN AIM 2, WE WILL EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF FLAVOR RESTRICTIONS AND T21 POLICIES ON TOBACCO USE (CIGARETTES, ENDS, SMOKELESS TOBACCO, CIGARS) ACROSS AGE (14-17-YEAR-OLDS VERSUS 18-YEAR-OLDS) IN THE YRBS AS WELL AS EXAMINE THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF BOTH TOBACCO POLICIES ON TOBACCO USE ACROSS SOCIO- DEMOGRAPHIC STRATA. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, COVID-19 WAS DECLARED A NATIONAL EMERGENCY IN MID-MARCH 2020 AND STATES HAVE ISSUED A PATCHWORK OF POLICIES, INCLUDING CLOSURE OF NON-ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES AND STAY-AT- HOME ORDERS.

SMOKERS WHO ARE UNABLE TO QUIT BUT WISH TO REDUCE POTENTIAL HARMS OF SMOKING MAY CONSIDER SWITCHING TO NONCOMBUSTIBLE TOBACCO PRODUCTS SUCH AS SMOKELESS TOBACCO OR ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. HOWEVER, UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS DUAL USE MAY MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF THESE NONCOMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS TO REDUCE SMOKING -RELATED HARMS. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC BURDEN CAUSED BY CIGARETTE SMOKING. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE IN THIS APPLICATION IS TO CHARACTERIZE PRODUCT TRANSITIONS AMONG CIGARETTE SMOKERS TO EVALUATE THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING TO NONCOMBUSTIBLES AND ASSESS THE POTENTIAL OF NONCOMBUSTIBLES AS A HARM REDUCTION STRATEGY. THE TRANSITION MODEL OUTLINES FOUR TRAJECTORIES THAT A SMOKER MAY FOLLOW \u2013 CONTINUED SMOKING (LEAST OPTIMAL OUTCOME), COMPLETE CESSATION (MOST OPTIMAL OUTCOME), EXCLUSIVE NONCOMB USTIBLE USE (POSSIBLE HARM REDUCTION) OR DUAL/POLY TOBACCO USE (UNLIKELY TO BE HARM REDUCTION).

THE TWO SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO: 1) CONDUCT CLUSTER ANALYSIS ON TOBACCO BIOMARKERS OF ADULT CURRENT CIGARETTE SMOKERS AND GROUP SMOKERS INTO CLUSTERS BASED ON CONCENTRATIONS OF TOBACCO TOXICANT BIOMARKERS (I.E., URINARY BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE TO NICOTINE, TSNAS, PAHS, AND VOCS) COLLECTED AT WAVE 3 OF THE PATH STUDY. WE WILL EXAMINE WHETHER USE PATTERNS (E.G. FLAVOR, EXCLUSIVE, DUAL, AND POLY USE), PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND NICOTINE DEPENDENCE VARY BY CLUSTER MEMBERSHIP. 2) PERFORM GROWTH CURVE ANALYSIS TO MODEL CHANGE OVER TIME IN NICOTINE DEPENDENCE TO IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE DEPENDENCE TRAJECTORIES (I.E. DIFFERENTIAL NICOTINE DEPENDENCE PATTERNS) DURING FOUR CONSECUTIVE WAVES AND EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TRAJECTORIES, OVERTIME CHANGE IN TOBACCO USE PATTERNS, AND SUCCESSFUL QUITTING (3+ M ABSTINENCE). IN SUM, THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES PRIORITY RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE MISSION OF THE FDA\u2019S CTP. RESULTANT DATA COULD BE LEVERAGED TO INFORM PRODUCT LABELING AND PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGNS, ESPECIALLY THOSE ADDRESSING TOXICANT EXPOSURE AND DEPENDENCE RISK OF DUAL/POLY PRODUCT USE. UNTIL CONSUMERS ARE FULLY INFORMED ABOUT THE RISKS THEY TAKE WHEN ENGAGING IN DUAL/POLY TOBACCO PRODUCT USE, WE CAN EXPECT MORE AND MORE OF THEM TO ENGAGE IN THIS POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS BEHAVIOR.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "aca87389-2cb6-91e2-17a4-df7e81a7314d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21CA267932_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151948919, "Award ID": "R21CA260823", "Award Amount": 202611.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-15", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "SIMULATING THE IMPACT OF A MENTHOL BAN IN THE US; TRANSLATING THE CANADIAN MODEL - PROJECT SUMMARY MENTHOL CIGARETTES COMPRISE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE AMERICAN CIGARETTE MARKET WITH PREVALENCE ESTIMATES REACHING ABOUT 35% (FTC, 2016). MENTHOL IS A FLAVOURING AGENT ADDED TO CIGARETTES THAT MASKS THE TASTE OF TOBACCO, INDUCES SENSORY EFFECTS, AND RECRUITS AND RETAINS SMOKERS. AFTER A THOROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW, A U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) ADVISORY COMMITTEE NOTED THAT BANNING MENTHOL CIGARETTES WOULD BENEFIT PUBLIC HEALTH AND ANNOUNCED INTENTIONS TO REGULATE THE SALE OF MENTHOL IN TOBACCO IN NOVEMBER 2019. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO REGULATE MENTHOL CIGARETTES, THE FDA REQUIRES EVIDENCE ON THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF REGULATING MENTHOL AND REAL WORLD KNOWLEDGE ON THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION. THIS STUDY WILL USE TWO NIH/TRS FUNDED LONGITUDINAL STUDIES, THE PATH IN THE US, AND A COHORT OF SMOKERS FROM ONTARIO, CANADA TO DEVELOP A SIMULATION MODEL PREDICTING HOW THE CANADIAN BAN, ONE OF THE ONLY EVALUATED NATIONAL LEVEL IMPLEMENTED MENTHOL BAN IN THE WORLD, WOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE US GIVEN DIFFERENCES IN AGE, SEX, RACE, MENTHOL USE, AND EXPECTATIONS OF CHANGE OF BEHAVIOUR.

THE APPEALING FLAVORS ARE A PRIMARY REASON FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO INITIATE AND CONTINUE TO USE E-CIGARETTES. YOUNG ADULT NONSMOKERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO INITIATE E-CIGARETTE USE WITH NON-TOBACCO AND NON-MENTHOL (NTM) FLAVORS RATHER THAN TOBACCO AND MENTHOL (TM) FLAVORS COMPARED TO CURRENT SMOKERS, WHICH IS WORRISOME BECAUSE E-CIGARETTE USE LEADS TO CIGARETTE INITIATION. THE TYPES OF E-CIGARETTE MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SURGE IN E-CIGARETTE USE. ADVANCED GENERATION (OPEN-SYSTEM) DEVICES DELIVER NICOTINE FASTER THAN OLD GENERATION (CLOSED-SYSTEM) DEVICES AND CAN RAPIDLY REDUCE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS. UNDERSTANDING IF AND HOW E-CIGARETTE FLAVORS AND DEVICE TYPES AFFECT TOBACCO USE BEHAVIORS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO DEVELOPING REGULATORY ACTIVITIES THAT ADDRESS THE EPIDEMIC OF E- CIGARETTE USE. IN ADDITION, E-CIGARETTES HAVE BEEN MARKETED AGGRESSIVELY USING STRATEGIES THAT ARE APPEALING TO YOUNG PEOPLE. YOUTH EXPOSURE TO E-CIGARETTE ADVERTISING LEADS TO E-CIGARETTE INITIATION AND GREATER SUSCEPTIBILITY. BUT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM HAS NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED. A POTENTIAL MECHANISM IS THAT ADVERTISING EXPOSURE REDUCES PERCEIVED HARMS AND ADDICTIVENESS OF E-CIGARETTES, WHICH IN TURN, LEAD TO E- CIGARETTE INITIATION AND SUSCEPTIBILITY. LAST, E-CIGARETTE USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED RISKS FOR CARDIOPULMONARY AND PERIODONTAL DISEASES. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE HAS BEEN PREDOMINANTLY FROM CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA OR ON RELATIVELY SMALL SAMPLES. TO FILL THE KNOWLEDGE GAP, WE WILL USE LONGITUDINAL DATA (WAVES 1-4) FROM THE POPULATION ASSESSMENT OF TOBACCO AND HEALTH (PATH) STUDY TO ACCOMPLISH THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF E-CIGARETTE FLAVORS AND TYPES ON E-CIGARETTE USE AMONG YOUTH (12-17 YEARS), YOUNG ADULTS (18-34 YEARS), AND OLDER ADULTS (35 YEARS AND OLDER). WE WILL PERFORM MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WITH PROPENSITY SCORE WEIGHTS TO ASSESS THE OVERALL IMPACT OF E-CIGARETTE FLAVORS (NTM VS. TM) AND TYPES (OPEN VS. CLOSED- SYSTEM) ON E-CIGARETTE USE FREQUENCY. WE WILL PERFORM CAUSAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT, COMPARED TO TM FLAVORS, NTM FLAVORED E-CIGARETTE USE REDUCES HARM AND ADDICTION PERCEPTIONS OF E-CIGARETTES, WHICH LEAD TO MORE FREQUENT E-CIGARETTE USE; (2) DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURE TO E-CIGARETTE ADVERTISING ON E-CIGARETTE INITIATION, USE FREQUENCY, AND SUSCEPTIBILITY. SIMILAR TO AIM 1, WE WILL PERFORM MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF E-CIGARETTE ADVERTISING EXPOSURE ON THE OUTCOMES, AND CONDUCT CAUSAL MEDIATION ANALYSES TO ASSESS THE MEDIATING EFFECT OF HARM AND ADDICTION PERCEPTIONS OF E-CIGARETTES; AND (3) IDENTIFY THE EFFECT OF E-CIGARETTE USE ON CARDIOVASCULAR, RESPIRATORY, AND PERIODONTAL HEALTH, AND COMPARE THE EFFECTS AMONG DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOBACCO USERS (E.G., EXCLUSIVE E-CIGARETTE USERS NEVER CIGARETTE SMOKERS, EXCLUSIVE E-CIGARETTE USERS FORMER CIGARETTE SMOKERS, DUAL USERS, AND CIGARETTE-ONLY SMOKERS).

NICOTINE SALTS ARE EASIER TO INHALE THAN THE FREE-BASE FORM OF NICOTINE FOUND IN PREVIOUS GENERATION E-CIGS. WHILE THE LONG-TERM HEALTH IMPACT OF CIG SMOKE IS WELL KNOWN, THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHRONIC E-CIG USE REMAIN IN QUESTION, AND DATA IS NEEDED TO JUSTIFY IMMEDIATE FDA REGULATIONS. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF SMOKERS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN USING E-CIGS TO SUPPORT THEIR CESSATION EFFORTS AND INSTEAD BECOME DUAL USERS. THE CHEMICAL PROFILE OF CIG SMOKE AND E-CIGPOD AEROSOLS IS DIFFERENT, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF CHRONIC SMOKING AND VAPING MAY NOT FULLY OVERLAP. BUILDING UPON THIS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT CIG SMOKING AND E-CIGPOD VAPING, ARE INDEPENDENT RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOPULMONARY DISEASE, WHOSE SUPERPOSITION EXACERBATES THE MALADAPTIVE REMODELING OF THE LUNGS, HEART, AND VASCULATURE COMPARED TO EITHER PRACTICE ALONE. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE WILL EXPOSE HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIC AND WILDTYPE MICE TO NEBULIZED NICOTINE, AEROSOLIZED SOLVENT CARRIER, E-CIGPOD AEROSOLS, AND CIG SMOKE (NA\u00cfVE MICE), OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO (BOTH NA\u00cfVE AND PREVIOUSLY CIG SMOKE-EXPOSED MICE) AND WE WILL COMPARE THE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL REMODELING OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEMS. WE WILL GENERATE E-CIGPOD AEROSOLS FROM PODS IN TOBACCO FLAVOR AT 5% NICOTINE STRENGTH. MOTIVATED BY THE IDEA THAT SMOKERS WHO USE E-CIGS AS CESSATION AIDS MAY VAPE UNTIL THEY SATISFY THEIR NICOTINE CRAVINGS, WE WILL PERFORM EXPERIMENTS TO ACHIEVE EQUAL COTININE BIOAVAILABILITY IN THE MOUSE BLOOD, WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAME DAILY DURATION OF EXPOSURE.

E-CIG DEVICES AEROSOLIZE E-LIQUIDS THAT TYPICALLY CONSIST OF HUMECTANTS WITH VARIABLE LEVELS OF NICOTINE AND FLAVORING CHEMICALS. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FLAVOR MIXTURES, THEY ROUTINELY OVERLAP IN INDIVIDUAL FLAVOR CHEMICALS (FLAVORANTS), WHICH ARE FAR FEWER IN NUMBER. MANY OF THESE FLAVORANTS BELONG TO COMMON CHEMICAL CLASSES AND ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE FOR INGESTION. HOWEVER, THEIR DIRECT AND INDIRECT CARDIAC EFFECTS FOLLOWING HEATING AND INHALATION, PARTICULARLY IN COMBINATION WITH NICOTINE, REMAIN MOSTLY UNKNOWN. DIRECT EXPOSURE TO NICOTINE ALONE DISTINCTLY AFFECTS THE CARDIAC ACTION POTENTIAL WAVEFORM, POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF ARRHYTHMIAS AND SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH AMONG SMOKERS. RECENT EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT NICOTINE IN E-CIGS MAY SIMILARLY PROMOTE ADVERSE CARDIAC OUTCOMES. YET, THE INFLUENCE OF FLAVORANTS ON THE CARDIAC EFFECTS OF E-CIG AEROSOLS REMAINS UNTESTED. IN OUR ONGOING WORK, WE FOUND THAT EXPOSURE TO NICOTINE- CONTAINING E-CIG AEROSOLS OF VARIOUS FLAVORS ACUTELY AND DIFFERENTIALLY ALTERED THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) IN MICE, VARIABLY INDUCING QT INTERVAL PROLONGATION, INCREASING HEART RATE, AND EVOKING ARRHYTHMIA. AS WELL, TWO SEPARATE E-LIQUIDS WITH THE SAME CHARACTERIZING FLAVORANT CONSISTENTLY INCREASED VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS. FURTHERMORE, WE OBSERVED IN CARDIOMYOCYTES THAT TREATMENT WITH SEVERAL FLAVORANTS COMMON TO E-CIGS DIRECTLY ALTERED CONTRACTILITY, RHYTHMICITY, AND ACTION POTENTIAL DURATION. NONETHELESS, IT REMAINS UNKNOWN HOW INDIVIDUAL FLAVORANTS IN E-CIG AEROSOLS EXERT DIRECT OR INDIRECT CARDIAC EFFECTS IN VIVO. CONSIDERING THE GROWING POPULARITY OF E-CIGARETTES AND THE URGENT NEED FOR STUDYING THE IN VIVO TOXICOLOGICAL PROFILE OF CONSTITUENTS IN THESE PRODUCTS, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT E-CIGARETTE FLAVORANTS MODIFY THE EFFECTS OF E-CIG AEROSOL EXPOSURES ON CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, LEADING TO ARRHYTHMIAS AND FUNCTIONAL REMODELING OF THE HEART. TO TEST THIS, WE WILL SYSTEMATICALLY IDENTIFY BOTH ACUTE AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF FLAVORANT EXPOSURE ON CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY USING A COMBINATION OF STATE-OF-THE-ART IN VIVO, IN VITRO, AND EX VIVO APPROACHES.

CIGARETTES - TITLE: MULTI-PARAMETER INVESTIGATION OF FACTORS CONTROLLING CARBONYL EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ABSTRACT ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE (E-CIGARETTE) POPULARITY SKYROCKETED IN RECENT YEARS, ESPECIALLY AMONG TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS. E-CIGARETTE USE IS ALSO GROWING AMONG THE OLDER POPULATION. THIS TREND IS TROUBLING AS E-CIGARETTE AEROSOLS CONTAIN VARYING LEVELS OF NICOTINE AND OTHER CHEMICALS KNOWN TO INCREASE THE RISK OF NUMEROUS ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS. CARBONYL COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS FORMALDEHYDE, A KNOWN HUMAN CARCINOGEN, ARE THE MOST PROMINENT AMONG HAZARDOUS AND POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS CONSTITUENTS (HPHCS) FOUND IN E-CIGARETTE AEROSOLS. NUMEROUS FACTORS WERE REPORTED TO INFLUENCE CARBONYL PRODUCTION BY E-CIGARETTES: E-CIGARETTE TYPE, POWER, COIL MATERIAL, E-CIGARETTE LIQUID (E-LIQUID) COMPOSITION, AND PUFF TOPOGRAPHY (PUFF DURATION AND PUFF FLOW RATE). DIFFERENCES IN SAMPLING METHODOLOGY AND TESTING PROTOCOLS, AS WELL AS A LIMITED NUMBER OF PARAMETERS INVESTIGATED IN INDIVIDUAL STUDIES COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY REGARDING CARBONYL LEVELS IN E-CIGARETTE AEROSOLS OR THE ROLE INDIVIDUAL FACTORS PLAY IN THEIR PRODUCTION. THIS STUDY AIMS TO RESOLVE THE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS REGARDING E-CIGARETTE CARBONYL EMISSIONS BY PERFORMING A COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VARIABLE TESTING OF THE MOST POPULAR DEVICES REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MAIN E-CIGARETTE TYPES UNDER A WIDE RANGE OF USE PATTERNS. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE DATA AND OUR PRELIMINARY DATA, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT (1) ACCURATE AND REPRODUCIBLE CARBONYL MEASUREMENTS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY IF BOTH PARTICLE AND GAS PHASES ARE QUANTITATIVELY COLLECTED; (2) FLAVORING COMPOUNDS HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE ON CARBONYL PRODUCTION, WHICH DEPENDS ON THEIR CHEMICAL CLASS, CONCENTRATION AND INTERACTION WITH E-CIGARETTE COIL; (3) E-CIGARETTE CARBONYL EMISSIONS ARE A COMPLEX FUNCTION OF SEVERAL VARIABLES THAT NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED SIMULTANEOUSLY. THREE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES. AIM 1 WILL TEST THE MAIN CARBONYL COLLECTION METHODS USING A NIST-TRACEABLE FORMALDEHYDE STANDARD AND E-CIGARETTE AEROSOLS CONTAINING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF LIQUID PARTICULATES; THE BEST PERFORMING METHOD WILL BE SELECTED FOR THE CONSEQUENT TESTS. AIM 2 WILL INVESTIGATE INTERACTIONS OF THE MAIN FLAVORING COMPOUND CLASSES WITH E-CIGARETTE FRESH AND AGED COILS AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES AND E-LIQUID FORMULATIONS. AIM 3 WILL INVESTIGATE HOW DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF POWER, PUFF TOPOGRAPHY, AND E-LIQUID VISCOSITY AFFECT CARBONYL EMISSIONS OF THE MAIN E-CIGARETTE CONSTRUCTION TYPES. THE MAIN INNOVATION IN THE PROJECT IS AN EXPERIMENTALLY-EFFICIENT SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS FACTORS AND THEIR COMBINATIONS ON E-CIGARETTE EMISSIONS, WHICH IS LACKING IN THE CURRENT LITERATURE. THE POTENTIAL IMPACT WILL INCLUDE (1) A RECOMMENDATION ON THE BEST SAMPLING METHODOLOGY FOR CARBONYLS IN E-CIGARETTE AEROSOLS AND (2) IDENTIFICATION OF E-CIGARETTE AND E-LIQUID CHARACTERISTICS AND USE PARAMETERS THAT ARE THE MAIN CONTROLLING FACTORS FOR CARBONYL EMISSIONS BY E-CIGARETTES. SUCH INFORMATION IS CRITICALLY NEEDED TO ADVISE THE PUBLIC ON POTENTIAL HEALTH RISKS OF DIFFERENT DEVICES AND CONFIGURATIONS, ESTABLISHING STANDARDIZED TESTING PROTOCOLS, AND INFORMING POLICYMAKERS ON REGULATING CERTAIN E-CIGARETTE DESIGNS AND/OR E-LIQUID CONSTITUENTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NV", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "db2e86bc-d873-8ba5-31f9-060bf8695c90-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES033390_7529"}, {"internal_id": 139196721, "Award ID": "R01ES033016", "Award Amount": 1362801.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-08-17", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "EVALUATION AND COMPARISON OF IMPACTS OF FLAVORED WATERPIPE TOBACCO AND ELECTRONIC WATERPIPE E-LIQUID FORMULATION VARIATIONS ON TOXICANT YIELDS AND PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION IN MAINSTREAM EMISSIONS - PROJECT SUMMARY  WATERPIPE (WP) SMOKING HAS BECOME A POPULAR FORM OF TOBACCO USE IN THE US, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS. THESE GROUPS ARE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED TO FLAVORED WP TOBACCO (WPT). SWEET WPT FLAVORS ARE PREFERRED, WITH FRUIT FLAVORS IN PARTICULAR LEADING TO INITIATION AND CONTINUED WP USE, AS WELL AS THE MISPERCEPTION OF WP SMOKING AS LESS HARMFUL THAN CIGARETTE SMOKING. WPT SMOKING HAS BEEN LINKED TO MANY OF THE SAME ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS AS CIGARETTE SMOKING AND RELEASES MANY OF THE SAME HARMFUL AND POTENTIALLY HARMFUL CONSTITUENTS (HPHCS) AS CIGARETTES, AT 10-100 TIMES INCREASED LEVELS. THE POPULARITY OF FLAVORED WP SMOKING HAS EXPANDED IN RECENT YEARS TO FLAVORED TOBACCO-FREE ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC WP (EWP). EWP REPLACES THE TRADITIONAL WP BOWL AND HEAT SOURCE WITH AN ELECTRONIC HEAD FILLED WITH FLAVORED, NICOTINE-CONTAINING LIQUID (E-LIQUID), TURNING THE WP INTO AN ELECTRONIC NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEM (ENDS). GIVEN THE RISING POPULARITY OF OTHER FLAVORED ENDS, EWP MAY POSE SIMILAR APPEAL AND UPTAKE CONCERNS. EWP MAY BE PERCEIVED AS A SAFE WP ALTERNATIVE, BUT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RELEASE THE SAME HARMFUL EMISSIONS AS OTHER ENDS. YET NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SAFETY OF EWP, OR IF IT OFFERS ANY HARM REDUCTIONS COMPARED TO WPT SMOKING. FLAVORED WP PRODUCTS MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DIRECT HARMS OF WP SMOKING. EWP E-LIQUIDS AND WPTS BOTH USE FLAVORANTS, SWEET HUMECTANTS (PROPYLENE GLYCOL AND GLYCEROL), AND SUGARS TO ENHANCE THEIR APPEAL. THESE INGREDIENTS IN CIGARETTES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO FORM TOXIC ALDEHYDES AND FURANS DURING SMOKING. ENDS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT VARIATIONS IN E-LIQUID HUMECTANT CONTENT, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OF FLAVORINGS, CAN INCREASE ALDEHYDES EMISSIONS. FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE IS LACKING ON THE RANGE OF TOXICANTS EMISSIONS ACROSS FLAVORED WP PRODUCTS AND THE IMPACT OF VARIATIONS IN PRODUCT FORMULATIONS ON TOXIC EMISSIONS AND PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION, A CRITICAL PARAMETER IN THE DELIVERY OF TOXICANTS TO THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO REGULATE WP SMOKING AND SET PRODUCT STANDARDS TO REDUCE HARMS AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT US FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAVE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF FLAVORED WP SMOKING ON EXPOSURE AND HOW EXPOSURES MAY DIFFER BETWEEN TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE WP SMOKING PLATFORMS. THIS STUDY WILL FILL THESE GAPS BY EVALUATING AND COMPARING THE IMPACT OF VARIATIONS IN FLAVOR PROFILES, HUMECTANTS AND SUGAR LEVELS, AND HEATING TEMPERATURES, IN A VARIETY OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE WPTS AND EWP E-LIQUIDS ON YIELDS OF HPHCS AND OTHER TOXICANTS AS WELL AS PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION IN MAINSTREAM WP EMISSIONS. THIS WILL ALSO BE THE FIRST STUDY TO MEASURE TOXICANT EMISSIONS FROM EWP USE.

SURPRISINGLY, NO INDEPENDENT, LONG-TERM, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL HAS EXPERIMENTALLY EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF NON-TOBACCO FLAVORED VS. TOBACCO FLAVORED ECS ON PRODUCT UPTAKE, SUSTAINED USE, AND COMPLETE SWITCHING. WHILE THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, AND MEDICINE CONCLUDED THAT ECS ARE LIKELY TO BE FAR LESS HARMFUL THAN COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES, MORE THAN 1 MILLION EC PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN BANNED SINCE 2020, SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWING THE MARKETPLACE. ACCORDING TO THE US FDA, A KEY REASON FOR THE REMOVAL OF THESE PRODUCTS WAS THE SIGNIFICANT RISE IN YOUTH VAPING, OFTEN WITH FLAVORED ECS. INDEED, THE FDA DECISIONS CITED A FAILURE OF MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING THAT THE BENEFITS TO ADULT SMOKERS OUTWEIGHED THE \u201cDOCUMENTED RISKS TO YOUTH,\u201d SUGGESTING THAT THE SIGNIFICANT RISE IN YOUTH VAPING SIGNIFICANTLY TIPPED THE SCALES A PRIORI IN THE DIRECTION OF RESTRICTING EC FLAVORS.

FDA REQUIRES MORE ROBUST AND DEFINITIVE STUDIES EVALUATING THE BENEFIT OF EC FLAVORS, IF ANY, TO ADULT SMOKERS. TO PROVIDE THE NEEDED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, WE PROPOSE A NATIONWIDE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF EC FLAVORS ON 1) PRODUCT UPTAKE AND APPEAL, 2) CIGARETTE CRAVING, SYMPTOMS, AND DEPENDENCE, AND 3) SMOKING BEHAVIOR, INCLUDING SUSTAINED AND COMPLETE SWITCHING FROM CIGARETTES TO ECS.

E-CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS MAY USE SYNTHETIC NICOTINE AS A WAY TO AVOID ONGOING FDA REGULATORY PROCESSES FOR ECS. NICOTINE IS A CHIRAL COMPOUND WITH ONE ASYMMETRIC CARBON ATOM AND CAN EXIST AS TWO MIRROR IMAGE FORMS TERMED ENANTIOMERS OR OPTICAL ISOMERS, THE LEVOROTATORY (S)-ISOMER AND THE DEXTROROTATORY (R)-ISOMER. WHILE NICOTINE FROM TOBACCO IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVE (S)-NICOTINE, MOST SYNTHETIC NICOTINE IS COMPRISED OF RACEMIC (S)- AND (R)- NICOTINE.

THESE EFFECTS ARE PARTICULARLY FELT IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN (AA) COMMUNITY WHERE TARGETED MARKETING HAS RESULTED IN \u02dc85% OF AA VERSUS \u02dc20% OF WHITE SMOKERS USING MENTHOL CIGARETTES. THE FDA\u2019S DECISION TO ADVANCE THE RULEMAKING PROCESS TO BAN MENTHOL CIGARETTES IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD CLOSING THE GAP IN TOBACCO-RELATED DISEASE AND DEATH DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPERIENCED BY AA SMOKERS. THE AGENCY\u2019S REGULATORY ACTION STOPPED SHORT OF INCLUDING MENTHOL-FLAVORED E- CIGARETTES (ECS) AND DEBATE CONTINUES ABOUT WHETHER MORE COMPREHENSIVE ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES INCLUSIVE OF MENTHOL FLAVORED E-LIQUIDS SHOULD BE ENACTED. WHILE A BAN ON MENTHOL FLAVORED EC MAY REDUCE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULT INITIATION, IT MAY ALSO DISCOURAGE ADULT MENTHOL SMOKERS TO SWITCH FROM TOBACCO CIGARETTES TO EC. THIS COULD SLOW HARM REDUCTION AND RESULT IN A NEGATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT THAT WOULD BE CONCENTRATED IN RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES ALREADY DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY TOBACCO. FDA HAS IDENTIFIED THE IMPACT OF EC FLAVORING ON SMOKING PATTERNS AS A RESEARCH PRIORITY AREA, AND THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR STUDIES THAT EXAMINE POSSIBLE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATORY ACTIONS ON TOBACCO-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES. OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL (RCT) PROVIDED MENTHOL EC OR TOBACCO EC TO ADULT SMOKERS. AMONG MENTHOL SMOKERS, WE FOUND EQUIVALENT RATES OF SWITCHING FROM TOBACCO CIGARETTES TO EC, TOBACCO HARM REDUCTION, EC PRODUCT USE, AND ACCEPTABILITY BETWEEN THOSE WHO USED TOBACCO EC VERSUS MENTHOL EC, ALTHOUGH THE STUDY WAS LIMITED BY A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND WAS NOT PROSPECTIVELY DESIGNED FOR THESE COMPARISONS.

SOME ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ADVOCATED THAT NON-TOBACCO FLAVORINGS, INCLUDING MENTHOL, SHOULD ALSO BE BANNED FROM OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS LIKE E-CIGARETTES. DESPITE THE WEALTH OF CROSS-SECTIONAL AND UNCONTROLLED STUDIES OF MENTHOL, WE HAVE VERY LITTLE PROSPECTIVE, EXPERIMENTAL DATA INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF A MENTHOL BAN ON TOBACCO USE FOR MENTHOL SMOKERS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND EVEN LESS EVIDENCE ON HOW A MENTHOL BAN FOR E-LIQUIDS MIGHT INTERACT WITH A CIGARETTE MENTHOL BAN. IF MENTHOL IS BANNED FROM BOTH CIGARETTES AND E-CIGARETTES, MENTHOL SMOKERS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO SWITCH TO E-CIGARETTES MAY CONTINUE TO SMOKE CIGARETTES OR QUIT USING TOBACCO ALTOGETHER. THUS, THE IMPACT OF A CIGARETTE MENTHOL BAN ON CHANGES IN TOBACCO USE MAY DEPEND ON WHETHER MENTHOL IS BANNED IN E-CIGARETTES. THE PROPOSED TRIAL IS A 2X2 BETWEEN-SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF A MENTHOL BANS FOR CIGARETTES AND E-CIGARETTES ON TOBACCO USE PATTERNS INCLUDING CIGARETTE SMOKING, E-CIGARETTE USE, USE OF MEDICINAL NICOTINE, AND CESSATION-RELATED BEHAVIORS. CURRENT MENTHOL SMOKERS (N=240) WILL COMPLETE A 1-WEEK BASELINE PERIOD BEFORE BEING ASSIGNED TO EITHER MENTHOL OR NON-MENTHOL CIGARETTES AND EITHER MENTHOL OR TOBACCO-FLAVORED E-LIQUID FOR 7 WEEKS.

SUCH EVIDENCE WILL BE CRITICAL TO THE FDA'S ABILITY TO SET FURTHER REGULATORY STANDARDS TO REDUCE ENDS POTENTIAL HARM. OUR TEAM OF EXPERTS IN TOBACCO REGULATORY SCIENCE WILL APPLY CLINICAL AND ANALYTICAL LABORATORY METHODS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN EVIDENCE BY CONDUCTING A 2X2 (PRE-POST X MENTHOL VS. TOBACCO FLAVOR) CROSSOVER CLINICAL LAB STUDY. WE WILL RECRUIT CURRENT/PAST MONTH ENDS USERS (N=200, 21-35 YRS), WHO WILL COME TO THE LAB FOR TWO SESSIONS AND USE THEIR ENDS ONCE WITH MENTHOL AND ONCE WITH TOBACCO FLAVORS. WHILE WE APPLY STANDARD AND WELL-TESTED LAB MODELS SUITABLE FOR REGULATORY-RELATED RESEARCH, WE HAVE SUPPLEMENTED THESE WITH CUTTING-EDGE PUFFING ROBOT TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT ENDS-ASSOCIATED EMISSIONS OF TOXICANTS. THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL ANSWER TWO KEY REGULATORY QUESTIONS CONSISTENT WITH FDA\u2019S FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF FLAVOR IN TOBACCO PRODUCTS\u2019 ADDICTION AND TOXICITY; 1) COMPARED TO TOBACCO FLAVOR, DOES MENTHOL CARRY ADDITIONAL RISK BY ENHANCING PUFFING, ABUSE LIABILITY, AND TOXICANT EXPOSURE IN ENDS USERS, AND; 2) IS THIS EFFECT MORE PRONOUNCED AMONG HIGH DEPENDENCE COMPARED TO OTHER USERS. OTHER OUTCOMES SUCH AS HARM PERCEPTION, SATISFACTION, CLINICAL RESPONSES, INTENTION TO USE OR QUIT, AND GROUP COMPARISONS SUCH AS ACCORDING TO RACE, AND SEX WILL ALLOW THE FDA A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROS AND CONS OF REGULATING MENTHOLATED ENDS FOR DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE SOCIETY.

ALTHOUGH THE TOBACCO CONTROL ACT BANNED THE SALE OF CIGARETTES WITH CHARACTERIZING FLAVORS, MENTHOL CIGARETTES ARE CURRENTLY EXEMPT FROM THIS BAN, AND MENTHOL CIGARETTE USE REMAINS A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. USE OF MENTHOL CIGARETTES IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER NICOTINE DEPENDENCE AND LOWER RATES OF QUITTING SMOKING, AND RATES OF MENTHOL CIGARETTE USE ARE HIGHEST NATIONALLY AMONG BLACK PEOPLE, CONTRIBUTING TO TOBACCO-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT BANNING MENTHOL FLAVOR IN CIGARETTES WOULD BENEFIT PUBLIC HEALTH. HOWEVER, MENTHOL FLAVOR IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS, SUCH AS E-CIGARETTES, WHICH ARE THE MOST COMMONLY USED NON-CIGARETTE TOBACCO PRODUCT AMONG ADULTS. WHEN CONSIDERING FLAVOR RESTRICTIONS ON TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH, THE FDA COULD DECIDE TO BAN MENTHOL IN CIGARETTES, E-CIGARETTES, OR BOTH PRODUCTS. RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND HOW AVAILABILITY OF MENTHOL (VS. TOBACCO) FLAVORED E-CIGARETTES WOULD IMPACT CIGARETTE USE FOLLOWING A BAN OF MENTHOL CIGARETTES. THE CURRENT PROJECT WILL USE AN ESTABLISHED PARADIGM TO MODEL THE IMPACT OF THESE MENTHOL REGULATORY SCENARIOS ON REAL WORLD SMOKING BEHAVIOR.

THIS HPHC LIST, HOWEVER, WAS LAST UPDATED IN 2012, JUST PRIOR TO THE RISE IN ENDS POPULARITY. SINCE TWO OF THE FIVE ADDICTION-RELATED HPHCS ARE TOBACCO-RELATED MINOR ALKALOIDS (E.G., NORNICOTINE), THEN IT SUGGESTS RESEARCH ON ENDS-SPECIFIC MINOR ALKALOIDS IS WARRANTED. ONE UNIQUELY PREVALENT MINOR ALKALOID IN ENDS IS SS-NICOTYRINE, WHICH IS FORMED BY AGING AND/OR AEROSOLIZING E-LIQUIDS AND CAN REACH 25% OF NICOTINE LEVELS WHEN VAPED.

EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE USING ENDS ARE LIKELY TO ACCELERATE USE AND BECOME NICOTINE DEPENDENT. SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR ENDS AMONG YOUTH (E.G. JUUL WITH 5% NICOTINE LIQUID) DELIVER IN ONE CARTRIDGE A NICOTINE DOSE EQUAL TO AN ENTIRE PACK OF CIGARETTES, AND MANY USERS ARE UNAWARE OF THIS SUBSTANTIAL EXPOSURE AND THE RELATED RISK OF ADDICTION.

IN A PILOT STUDY USING INTRAVENOUS (IV) NICOTINE INFUSION \u2013 WHICH PROVIDES PRECISE CONTROL OVER DELIVERY RATE \u2013 WE FOUND THAT 1 MG/70KG NICOTINE, THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF NICOTINE DELIVERED BY SMOKING A CIGARETTE, INFUSED IV OVER 1 MINUTE, PRODUCED GREATER POSITIVE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS \u2013 INDICATING GREATER ABUSE POTENTIAL \u2013 COMPARED TO THE SAME AMOUNT OF NICOTINE DELIVERED OVER 5 OR 10 MINUTES.

AN EMERGING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PROMOTION OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS (I.E., ELECTRONIC NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEMS (ENDS), CIGARS, CIGARILLOS, LITTLE CIGARS, HOOKAH/WATERPIPE, PIPE, SMOKELESS TOBACCO, HEAT-NOT-BURN PRODUCTS) IS RAPIDLY GROWING. THESE MESSAGES ARE CURRENTLY UNDER-REGULATED, TARGET YOUTH, OFTEN CONTAIN MISINFORMATION, AND FEATURE BRANDED MERCHANDISE AND CELEBRITY OR \u201cINFLUENCER\u201d PROMOTION. YOUTH USE SOCIAL MEDIA AT HIGHER RATES THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION IN THE U.S., WHICH POTENTIALLY MULTIPLIES THE EFFECT OF TARGETED SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING. THE EXISTING REGULATORY IMBALANCES IN TREATMENT OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS (FTPS) AND DIGITAL MARKETING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS MAY EXPLAIN RECENT TRENDS IN YOUTH FTP USE. IN PARTICULAR, THE RECENT EXPONENTIAL RISE IN SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING COINCIDED WITH SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ENDS AND OTHER FTP USE AMONG U.S. YOUTH, WHICH HAS ERASED RECENT PROGRESS IN REDUCING OVERALL TOBACCO PRODUCT USE AMONG YOUTH. UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURE TO SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT CAN INFORM TOBACCO REGULATORY SCIENCE. UNFORTUNATELY, TO DATE, NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING OF SUCH FTPS. THIS PROJECT WILL FILL THIS CRITICAL RESEARCH GAP. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO FTP-RELATED SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT AND PROVIDE TIMELY SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR REGULATORY ACTIONS ON RESTRICTING MARKETING OF THESE PRODUCTS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT ARE AIM 1: TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE POTENTIALLY REGULATABLE SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGE CONTENT RELATED TO FTPS BY SOURCE (E.G., BRAND, INFLUENCER/COMMUNITY, REGULAR CONSUMER) AND MAJOR THEMES (E.G., NEW-USER TARGETING, HEALTH RISKS, FLAVOR-TYPE); AIM 2: TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL AND INFLUENCER FTP CONTENT ON PRODUCT SALES AND ON YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULT AWARENESS, RISK PERCEPTIONS, INTENTIONS TO USE, INITIATION, AND PATTERNS OF USE OF FTP PRODUCTS; AND AIM 3: TO STUDY WHETHER/TO WHAT EXTENT FTP REGULATORY POLICIES MODIFY THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURE TO SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT ON FTP PRODUCT SALES AND YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULT AWARENESS, RISK PERCEPTIONS, INTENTIONS TO USE, INITIATION, AND PATTERNS OF USE OF FTP PRODUCTS. THESE AIMS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY APPLYING CLASSIC THEORIES OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR AND ADVERTISING, ALONG WITH INNOVATIVE ANALYTIC METHODS, TO A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF DATA SETS, INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA DATA FROM TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM, INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DATA ON EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO MARKETING, TOBACCO ATTITUDES, AND TOBACCO USE FROM THE POPULATION ASSESSMENT OF TOBACCO AND HEALTH (PATH) SURVEYS, FTP SALES VOLUME DATA FROM NIELSEN STORE SCANNER DATA, AND STATE/LOCAL FTP POLICY DATA COLLECTED BY NORC.

BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICANS (AA) HAVE THE HIGHEST TOBACCO-RELATED CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY RATES OF ANY RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP. OVER 70% OF AA SMOKERS SMOKE MENTHOL AS THEIR USUAL BRAND, COMPARED TO 20% FOR WHITE SMOKERS. MENTHOL IS THE ONLY CHARACTERIZING FLAVOR ALLOWED IN CIGARETTES UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL REGULATIONS, AND MENTHOL USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRESSION TO ESTABLISHED CIGARETTE SMOKING AS WELL AS MORE DIFFICULTY QUITTING. EVIDENCE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF ELECTRONIC NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEMS (ENDS, I.E., E-CIGARETTES) SUGGESTS THESE PRODUCTS MAY BE A LESS HARMFUL ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES. LITTLE WORK HAS EXAMINED HOW ENDS UPTAKE AFFECTS TOBACCO USE AND ASSOCIATED TOXICITY AMONG AA SMOKERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO SMOKE MENTHOL. RECENTLY, FDA BEGAN REGULATING CLOSED-SYSTEM DEVICES LIKE JUUL, WHICH HAVE CAPTURED OVER 70% OF THE ENDS MARKET AND CONTRIBUTED TO DRAMATIC INCREASES IN YOUTH ENDS USE. AS OF EARLY 2020, FLAVORED ENDS CARTRIDGES (SMALL, ENCLOSED UNIT USED AS PART OF AN ENDS) OTHER THAN MENTHOL/TOBACCO ARE BANNED IN THE US. HOWEVER, TO ACHIEVE ITS PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION, THE FDA MUST BALANCE RESTRICTING ACCESS TO ENDS FLAVORS THAT APPEAL TO YOUTH WITH THE NEED FOR EVIDENCE ON \u201cWHETHER AND HOW CERTAIN FLAVORS MAY HELP ADULT CIGARETTE SMOKERS REDUCE CIGARETTE USE AND SWITCH TO POTENTIALLY LESS HARMFUL PRODUCTS\u201d (FDA, 2018). UNDERSTANDING THE POTENTIAL OF ENDS TO REDUCE THE PUBLIC HEALTH BURDEN OF COMBUSTED TOBACCO USE EQUITABLY REQUIRES A TARGETED STUDY TO PREDICT HOW FUTURE ENDS FLAVOR REGULATIONS WILL IMPACT AA MENTHOL SMOKERS. THE CURRENT STUDY WILL EVALUATE WHETHER ENDS MENTHOL FLAVOR AVAILABILITY AFFECTS MEASURES OF TOBACCO USE, BIOMARKERS OF CIGARETTE/ENDS EXPOSURE, AND ADDICTION AMONG AA MENTHOL SMOKERS (N=210) BY PERFORMING A 3-ARM, PARALLEL-GROUP, 6-WEEK CLINICAL TRIAL OF ENDS PROVISION WITH FOLLOW-UP TO 30 DAYS. JUUL DEVICES WITH COMPATIBLE CARTRIDGES AT 5% NICOTINE, WHICH OUR TEAM HAS EXTENSIVELY EVALUATED, WILL BE PROVIDED. STUDY ARMS WILL DIFFER BY POTENTIAL FDA REGULATIONS ON ENDS FLAVOR AVAILABILITY: 1) THE CURRENT MARKET WHERE ONLY MENTHOL AND TOBACCO FLAVORED ENDS CARTRIDGES ARE AVAILABLE; 2) A MARKET WHERE ONLY TOBACCO FLAVOR IS AVAILABLE, AND 3) A MARKET WITH ONLY UNFLAVORED CARTRIDGES. STUDY VISITS WILL OCCUR WEEKLY BEGINNING 1 WEEK PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION WITH DAILY TOBACCO USE MONITORING THROUGHOUT AND BIOMARKER/SELF-REPORT DATA COLLECTION AT EACH WEEKLY VISIT. AA MENTHOL SMOKERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED BY TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND COULD EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH BENEFITS FROM INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF WELL-REGULATED ENDS. RESULTS OF THIS WORK WILL HELP FDA MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE IMPACT ON AA MENTHOL SMOKERS OF MOVING FROM THE CURRENT REGULATORY MARKET FOR CARTRIDGE-BASED ENDS WHERE MENTHOL AND TOBACCO ARE AVAILABLE, TO ONE WHERE ONLY TOBACCO OR NO FLAVORS ARE AVAILABLE. ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS WILL ADDRESS FDA'S PRIORITIES IN BEHAVIOR, TOXICITY, AND ADDICTION, AND WILL PROVIDE NEW DATA REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF POTENTIAL FDA REGULATORY ACTIONS ON MENTHOL

CIGAR USE EXPOSES YOUTH TO THE ADDICTIVE EFFECTS OF NICOTINE DURING A CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD AND INCREASES THEIR RISKS FOR MULTIPLE CANCERS AND PREMATURE DEATH. OF THE THREE MAJOR TYPES OF CIGARS\u2014LARGE CIGARS, LITTLE CIGARS, AND CIGARILLOS\u2014LITTLE CIGARS AND CIGARILLOS (LCCS) ARE THE MOST COMMONLY USED IN THE US, PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNGER PEOPLE. LCC USE ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO TOBACCO HEALTH DISPARITIES, AS BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTH USE CIGARS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN OTHER YOUTH. IN 2016, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) MANDATED SIX ROTATING TEXT-ONLY WARNING STATEMENTS TO BE ON LCC PACKAGING. LITTLE RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FDA-MANDATED LCC WARNINGS IN REDUCING YOUTH WILLINGNESS TO USE LCCS. RESEARCH FROM STUDIES OF CIGARETTES SUGGESTS THAT EFFECTIVE WARNINGS SHOULD BE LARGE AND INCLUDE IMAGES THAT ILLUSTRATE THE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH USE. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE FOR CIGARETTE WARNINGS CANNOT ADEQUATELY INFORM IMPLEMENTATION OF IMPROVED LCC WARNINGS BECAUSE: 1) THERE IS NO EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FDA- MANDATED TEXT-ONLY LCC WARNINGS ON BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS OR OUTCOMES AMONG YOUTH; 2) COURTS HAVE RULED THAT EFFECTIVE TOBACCO WARNINGS ON ONE TYPE OF TOBACCO PRODUCT (I.E., CIGARETTES) CANNOT BE USED TO JUSTIFY WARNINGS ON OTHER TYPES OF TOBACCO (I.E., LCCS), AND 3) LCC USERS HAVE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC AND CONSUMPTION PROFILES THAN CIGARETTE USERS. FURTHERMORE, THE US COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DC CIRCUIT RECENTLY RULED THAT THE FDA CANNOT REQUIRE WARNING LABELS FOR CIGARS, CLAIMING THAT THE FDA DID NOT PROVIDE EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF CIGAR WARNINGS ON SMOKING RATES, INCLUDING INITIATION AND CESSATION.

CIGARILLO SMOKING HAS MANY NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS, IS ASSOCIATED WITH USING OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS, SUCH AS CIGARETTES, AND CIGARILLO SMOKE CONTAINS MANY TOXIC CHEMICALS.

WE WILL THEN RECRUIT ANOTHER SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULT AND BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN FREQUENT CIGARILLO USERS TO PARTICIPATE IN A 6-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WHERE THEY WILL BE EXPOSED TO CIGARILLO WARNINGS WEEKLY TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE WARNINGS ON CIGARILLO SMOKING INTENTIONS AND BEHAVIORS. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WARNING LABELS TO DISCOURAGE CIGARILLO USE AMONG YOUNG ADULTS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN.

ADOLESCENTS ARE EXPOSED TO E-CIGARETTE ENDORSEMENTS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS WHO PROMOTE THESE HARMFUL PRODUCTS ON BEHALF OF E-CIGARETTE BRANDS AS A HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL CIGARETTES. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES TO COMPREHENSIVELY DESCRIBE E-CIGARETTE INFLUENCER MARKETING ON INSTAGRAM (THE MOST WIDELY USED PLATFORM FOR E-CIGARETTE INFLUENCERS) AND ON OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS POPULAR AMONG U.S. TEENAGERS; TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING AND PATTERNS OF INITIATION AND CHANGE IN E-CIGARETTE USE; AND TO EXPLORE YOUTH ATTITUDES AND IDEAS RELATED TO E-CIGARETTE INFLUENCERS AND E- CIGARETTE PREVENTION CAMPAIGNS. FOR AIM 1, WE WILL USE INNOVATIVE, VALIDATED DEEP-LEARNING MODELS - A FORM OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT AUTOMATICALLY DISCOVERS PATTERNS IN DATA - TO EVALUATE TRENDS IN MARKETING THEMES AND COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WARNING LABELS AND SPONSORSHIP DISCLOSURES IN E-CIGARETTE PROMOTIONAL IMAGES AND VIDEOS ON INSTAGRAM, YOUTUBE AND TIKTOK TO BE COLLECTED FROM 2021 TO 2023 (OVER FOUR MILLION POSTS, IN ALL).

HEAT-NOT-BURN (HNB) TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE AN EMERGING NICOTINE DELIVERY INNOVATION DESIGNED TO DELIVER NICOTINE WITH LESS TOXINS THAN COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES. IN 2019, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) AUTHORIZED THE SALE OF IQOS, THE ONLY HNB TOBACCO PRODUCT IN THE UNITED STATES. MANUFACTURED BY PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL, IQOS IS A RECHARGEABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICE THAT PRODUCES A NICOTINE-CONTAINING AEROSOL BY HEATING A DISPOSABLE TOBACCO STICK. SINCE ENTERING THE TOBACCO MARKET IN 2014, GLOBAL SALES OF IQOS HAVE INCREASED WITH MILLIONS OF USERS ACROSS 50 COUNTRIES. TOBACCO SCIENTISTS AND MARKET ANALYSTS FORECAST RAPID GROWTH IN IQOS SALES IN THE U.S. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WHILE AWARENESS AND USE OF IQOS IS INCREASING AMONG CIGARETTE SMOKERS, THE LACK OF DATA ON THE IMPACT OF IQOS USE ON CIGARETTE SMOKING BEHAVIORS LEAVES US UNABLE TO ANSWER FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS RELEVANT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND REGULATORY EFFORTS. FIRST, DO CIGARETTE SMOKERS SWITCH COMPLETELY TO IQOS OR DO THEY DUAL USE THESE TWO TOBACCO PRODUCTS? PHILLIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL\u2019S CLAIM THAT IQOS USE RESULTS IN LESS EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL CHEMICALS THAN COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES RESTS ON SMOKERS SWITCHING COMPLETELY TO IQOS. SECOND, DOES IQOS USE AFFECT SMOKERS\u2019 INTENTIONS TO QUIT SMOKING CIGARETTES? THIRD, HOW DO INDICES OF SATISFACTION WITH IQOS USE (E.G., CRAVING AND WITHDRAWAL RELIEF, SUBJECTIVE REWARD, AND RELATIVE REINFORCING VALUE), AS WELL AS IQOS RISK PERCEPTIONS, IMPACT COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTE SMOKING? THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL FILL THESE GAPS IN THE EVIDENCE BASE BY RECRUITING 100 COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTE SMOKERS TO A 21-DAY PROTOCOL USING A WITHIN-SUBJECTS DESIGN. BASELINE SMOKING RATE WILL BE ESTABLISHED DURING DAYS 1-5. AFTER OVERNIGHT CIGARETTE SMOKING ABSTINENCE, LABORATORY VISITS ON DAYS 6 AND 7 WILL ASSESS IQOS-ASSOCIATED CRAVING RELIEF, WITHDRAWAL RELIEF, RISK PERCEPTIONS, SUBJECTIVE REWARD, AND THE REINFORCING VALUE OF IQOS RELATIVE TO COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES. PARTICIPANTS WILL SWITCH FROM CIGARETTE SMOKING TO IQOS USE FOR THE FOLLOWING 14 DAYS (DAYS 8-21). PARTICIPANTS WILL COLLECT THEIR SPENT CIGARETTE FILTERS AND THEIR USED IQOS HEATSTICKS DAILY IN ORDER TO ASSESS CONSUMPTION OF CIGARETTES PER DAY (CPD) AND TOBACCO STICKS PER DAY (SPD). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS THE LONGITUDINAL DAILY COUNT OF CIGARETTES FROM BASELINE TO THE END OF THE IQOS SWITCH PHASE. CHANGES IN MOTIVATION TO QUIT SMOKING FROM BASELINE TO STUDY END WILL BE A SECONDARY OUTCOME. AS OUTLINED IN RFA-OD-19-028, THE FINDINGS WILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS FDA\u2019S PRIORITY TO ASSESS THE LIKELY IMPACT OF HEATED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ON CIGARETTE SMOKING BEHAVIORS (I.E., SWITCHING, USE, DUAL

BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE TO ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE AEROSOL - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE (E-CIG) USAGE IS ON THE RISE, PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUTHS; HOWEVER, THEIR POTENTIAL FOR HARM IS NOT UNDERSTOOD, COMPLICATING DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMED REGULATORY STRATEGIES. THE LACK OF DATA ON E-CIG RELATED HARM IS, IN PART, DUE TO THE LACK OF SPECIFIC BIOMARKERS FOR EXPOSURE TO E-CIG AEROSOLS. WE FOUND THAT E-CIG AEROSOL CONTAINS HIGHLY REACTIVE FREE RADICALS THAT CAN CAUSE OXIDATIVE DAMAGE TO THE USER. FREE RADICALS CAN DAMAGE NUMEROUS CELLULAR PATHWAYS POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROGRESSION OF CANCERS AND OTHER DISEASES. DETECTION OF E-CIG FREE RADICALS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY TRAPPING WITH SPIN TRAPS (E.G., DMPO) AND ANALYSIS BY ELECTRON PARAMAGNETIC RESONANCE (EPR) SPECTROSCOPY. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH WITH EPR SHOWS THAT FREE RADICALS PRODUCED IN THE E-CIG AEROSOL BY E-LIQUID SOLVENTS, PROPYLENE GLYCOL (PG) AND GLYCERIN (GLY), COMMON TO ALL E-CIGS, DISPLAY UNIQUE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY THESE FREE RADICAL STRUCTURES AND UTILIZE THEIR UNIQUE STRUCTURE TO DEVELOP AN E-CIG SPECIFIC BIOMARKER OF EXPOSURE. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE: (AIM 1) TO DETERMINE THE STRUCTURES OF THE FREE RADICALS PRODUCED BY PG AND GLY IN E-CIGS; (AIM 2) TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY TARGETS OF AND ADDUCTS FORMED FROM FREE RADICAL ASSAULT IN THE TISSUE OF E-CIG EXPOSURES IN RODENT MODELS AND POSSIBLE METABOLITES FORMED FROM THE THESE RADICAL ADDUCTS IN THE SERUM OF E-CIG EXPOSED RODENT. THIS PROJECT REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT RESEARCH DIRECTION WHERE A CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL APPROACH CAN INFORM TOBACCO REGULATORY SCIENCE. AS SUCH, AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS APPLICATION IT TO EXTEND MY BACKGROUND IN AREAS RELEVANT TO TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SPECIFIC TRAINING IN NEW BIOMARKER-RELEVANT RESEARCH AREAS INCLUDING METABOLOMICS AND FREE RADICAL STRUCTURAL IDENTIFICATION. TO THIS END, MY TRAINING WILL OCCUR THROUGH A SERIES OF COURSES, RELEVANT MENTORSHIP, AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE, EACH GEARED TO ENSURE MY TRANSITION TO AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER IN THE FIELDS OF BIOMARKER DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY SCIENCE. COURSEWORK, MENTORSHIP, CONFERENCE PARTICIPATION, AND PRACTICAL TRAINING/EXPERIENCE WILL BE COMPLETED DURING THE K99 PHASE. DURING THIS PHASE, AIM 1 OF THE RESEARCH PLAN WILL BE COMPLETED AND AIM 2 WILL BE INITIATED (FOR COMPLETION DURING THE R00 PHASE OF THE AWARD). TO ACCOMPLISH THE RESEARCH AIMS, ADVANCED PULSED EPR AND MASS SPECTROSCOPY APPROACHES WILL BE UTILIZED FOR RADICALS PRODUCED BY PG AND GLY IN E-CIG AEROSOLS. IN A MOUSE EXPOSURE MODEL, FREE RADICAL EXPOSURE AND TARGETS OF ATTACK IN THE LUNG WILL BE DETERMINED USING A NOVEL IN VIVO DMPO/ANTI-DMPO ANTIBODY APPROACH. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC PROTEIN AND DNA ADDUCTS BY TOF-MS. A POST-DMPO EXPOSURE STUDY WILL CONSIST OF AN UNTARGETED PAIRWISE METABOLOMICS APPROACH TO LOOK AT CHANGES IN METABOLITE PROFILES BEFORE AND AFTER E-CIG EXPOSURE. BY LEVERAGING THE UNIQUE STRUCTURES OF E-CIG PRODUCED FREE RADICALS AND THEIR TARGETS OF ATTACK IN THE LUNG, BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE SPECIFIC TO E-CIG AEROSOLS CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND USED TO DEVELOP REGULATORY STRATEGIES AIMED AT REDUCING HARM FROM E-CIG EXPOSURE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "47ed9961-3300-5ed7-bb62-e5359d99eaf9-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R00HL147346_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151947663, "Award ID": "R00CA260718", "Award Amount": 497941.69, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-06", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "TESTING THE EFFECT OF ANTI-TOBACCO MESSAGE FRAMING ON POLYTOBACCO USE IN LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, AND TRANSGENDER YOUNG ADULTS - PROJECT SUMMARY POLYTOBACCO USE, DEFINED AS CONCURRENT USE OF MORE THAN ONE TOBACCO PRODUCT INCLUDING ELECTRONIC NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEMS (ENDS), IS RISING AND HIGH IN LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, AND TRANSGENDER (LGBT) YOUNG ADULTS (YA). BETWEEN 22-40% OF LGBT YA (VS 12-21% OF NON-LGBT YA) REPORT PAST 30-DAY POLYTOBACCO USE, AND LGBT YA ARE LESS LIKELY TO PERCEIVE TOBACCO USE AS HARMFUL. LOW RISK PERCEPTIONS MAY REINFORCE TOBACCO USE AND WIDEN EXISTING DISPARITIES.

THIS PROPOSAL DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE FDA\u2019S MANDATE TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC BY ADDRESSING THE RESEARCH PRIORITY AREA OF COMMUNICATIONS. WHILE STUDIES INDICATE THAT ANTITOBACCO COMMUNICATIONS CAN SUCCESSFULLY INCREASE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT TOBACCO USE RISKS, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO THE EXTANT LITERATURE, AS FOLLOWS: (1) WHILE STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE RISK COMMUNICATION ARE WELL-ESTABLISHED, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW TO FRAME BEHAVIORAL CHOICES (E.G., TOTAL TOBACCO CESSATION VS SWITCHING TO ENDS) TO INCREASE TOBACCO RISK PERCEPTIONS AND INTENTIONS TO QUIT IN POLYTOBACCO USERS. (2) ANTITOBACCO CAMPAIGNS OFTEN LEVERAGE CULTURAL TARGETING, A BROADLY SUPPORTED BUT COSTLY COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY, TO INCREASE AT-RISK POPULATION ENGAGEMENT. NO STUDIES HAVE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LGBT CULTURALLY TARGETED VS NON- TARGETED ANTI-TOBACCO MESSAGES. (3) MOBILE MULTIMEDIA MESSAGING HAS BEEN USED TO DISSEMINATE SMOKING CESSATION COMMUNICATIONS AND MAY BE FEASIBLE FOR DISTRIBUTING ANTI-POLYTOBACCO MESSAGES TO LGBT YA, BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED.

THE SITUATION IS COMPOUNDED BY AGGRESSIVE E-CIGARETTE MARKETING, WHICH OFTEN FEATURES FLAVORS, MODELS, MARKETING CLAIMS, AND PRICE PROMOTIONS. EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THE STRONG INFLUENCE OF TOBACCO MARKETING ON THE INITIATION AND USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS AMONG YOUNG ADULTS, ESPECIALLY YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE NA\u00cfVE TO TOBACCO.

INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR FOCUSING ON HOW POLLUTANT EXPOSURES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT RESPIRATORY HEALTH AND IDENTIFY MEASURES TO EFFECTIVELY MITIGATE SUCH EXPOSURES. MY PRIMARY PROJECT OBJECTIVE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY OF CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS OF CONCERN (CCOC), NAMELY METAL AND ALDEHYDES, AS WELL AS THE PULMONARY HEALTH EFFECTS, INCLUDING INFLAMMATION, OF USING NEW AND EMERGING ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE (E-CIG) DEVICES AMONG YOUNG ADULTS. E-CIG DEVICES WORK BY HEATING A MIXTURE OF CHEMICALS TO GENERATE AN AEROSOL THAT IS INHALED BY THE USER. USE OF E-CIGS HAS INCREASED AND, AMONG ADULTS, REMAINS THE HIGHEST AMONG THOSE AGED 18 TO 24 YEARS. MORE RECENT E-CIG DEVICES SUCH AS DISPOSABLE PODS HAVE GROWN IN POPULARITY, YET IT IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN WHETHER THESE NEW DEVICES\u2019 DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS IN CONJUNCTION WITH USER VAPING REGIMEN IMPACT CCOC EXPOSURE AND INFLUENCE RESPIRATORY HEALTH. THUS, MY SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO 1) EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN E-CIG USE AND CCOC EXPOSURE AND EFFECT, 2) ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION OF E-CIG USE WITH RESPIRATORY OUTCOMES AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, AND 3) ASSESS CCOC EXPOSURE AS A MIXTURE AND POTENTIAL MEDIATOR IN E-CIG RELATED RESPIRATORY HEALTH OUTCOMES. IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY, TO ACHIEVE AIM 1 (K99 PHASE), 150 PARTICIPANTS (75 E-CIG USERS, 75 NON-USERS) WILL BE RECRUITED TO ASSESS BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE (ALDEHYDES, METALS) AND EFFECT (METALLOTHIONEIN) FROM E-CIG USE. THIS WILL LEVERAGE THE ONGOING EMIT STUDY WHICH LOOKS AT METAL EXPOSURE AND COLLECTS E-CIG USER REGIMEN VIA QUESTIONNAIRE, AEROSOL SAMPLES, BIOSPECIMENS (BLOOD, URINE), AND SPIROMETRY MEASURES. AFTER RECEIVING TRAINING IN CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, RESPIRATORY CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, INCLUDING GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES, A NEW COHORT OF 150 PARTICIPANTS (75 E-CIG USERS, 75 NON-USERS) WILL BE RECRUITED FOR AIM 2 (R00 PHASE). THIS PHASE WILL NOT ONLY COLLECT THE SAME DATA AS IN AIM 1 BUT ALSO BIOMARKERS OF EFFECT AND INFLAMMATION (BLOOD, URINE, FENO) AND GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES (IN NASAL EPITHELIAL CELLS). WHETHER E-CIG USERS HAVE INCREASED RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS, INFLAMMATION AND ALTERED GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES COMPARED TO NON-USERS WILL BE EVALUATED. COMBINING AIMS 1 AND 2 COHORTS (N= 300), AIM 3 WILL EMPLOY THE USE OF BAYESIAN AND CAUSAL MEDIATION METHODS TO ASSESS IF CCOC EXPOSURE IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH AND EXPLAINS, AT LEAST IN PART, THE RESPIRATORY EFFECTS FROM E-CIG USE. WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF NEWER E-CIG DEVICES, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO CHARACTERIZE EXPOSURE AND RESPIRATORY HEALTH EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THEIR USE. THIS STUDY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE CRITICAL DATA TO INFORM FDA REGULATION TO LIMIT ADVERSE EXPOSURES AND HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CURB THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF USE AMONG YOUNG ADULTS. THROUGH THIS RESEARCH, MY DIDACTIC COURSEWORK, AND THE GUIDANCE OF MY MENTORING TEAM CONSISTING OF A PULMONOLOGIST, EXPOSURE SCIENTIST, IMMUNOLOGIST, ANALYTICAL CHEMIST, AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST, I WILL ACQUIRE CRITICAL SKILLS NEEDED TO BE A SUCCESSFUL INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND TOBACCO CONTROL.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K99ES034507_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140658720, "Award ID": "K99ES033835", "Award Amount": 281862.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-21", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "PULMONARY TOXICOLOGICAL EVALUATION AND CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS OF MENTHOL, MINT, AND TOBACCO FLAVORED E-CIGARETTE PRODUCTS - SUMMARY ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE FLAVORS, TOBACCO, MENTHOL, AND COOLING FLAVORS HAVE BECOME WIDELY POPULAR.

LOW RISK PERCEPTIONS MAY REINFORCE TOBACCO USE AND WIDEN EXISTING DISPARITIES. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) CENTER FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS (CTP) IS MANDATED EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT TOBACCO PRODUCT RISKS, YET NO EVIDENCE DESCRIBES HOW TO EFFECTIVELY FRAME ANTI- POLYTOBACCO RISK COMMUNICATIONS. THE PROPOSED TRAINING OBJECTIVES ARE FOR THE APPLICANT TO DEVELOP ADVANCED SKILLS IN HEALTH COMMUNICATION SCIENCE; BIO-BEHAVIORAL METHODS, INCLUDING PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT; AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THESE SKILLS WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION OF POLYTOBACCO USE RISKS TO AT-RISK LGBT YA. THIS PROPOSAL DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE FDA\u2019S MANDATE TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC BY ADDRESSING THE RESEARCH PRIORITY AREA OF COMMUNICATIONS. WHILE STUDIES INDICATE THAT ANTITOBACCO COMMUNICATIONS CAN SUCCESSFULLY INCREASE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT TOBACCO USE RISKS, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO THE EXTANT LITERATURE, AS FOLLOWS: (1) WHILE STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE RISK COMMUNICATION ARE WELL-ESTABLISHED, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW TO FRAME BEHAVIORAL CHOICES (E.G., TOTAL TOBACCO CESSATION VS SWITCHING TO ENDS) TO INCREASE TOBACCO RISK PERCEPTIONS AND INTENTIONS TO QUIT IN POLYTOBACCO USERS. (2) ANTITOBACCO CAMPAIGNS OFTEN LEVERAGE CULTURAL TARGETING, A BROADLY SUPPORTED BUT COSTLY COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY, TO INCREASE AT-RISK POPULATION ENGAGEMENT. NO STUDIES HAVE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LGBT CULTURALLY TARGETED VS NON- TARGETED ANTI-TOBACCO MESSAGES. (3) MOBILE MULTIMEDIA MESSAGING HAS BEEN USED TO DISSEMINATE SMOKING CESSATION COMMUNICATIONS AND MAY BE FEASIBLE FOR DISTRIBUTING ANTI-POLYTOBACCO MESSAGES TO LGBT YA, BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED.

THE FDA HAS LONG INDICATED INTEREST IN BANNING MENTHOL AS A CHARACTERIZING FLAVOR IN COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES DUE TO ITS ROLE IN FACILITATING THE INITIATION AND USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SMOKING-RELATED DEATHS. SMOKING-INDUCED INFLAMMATION IS A LEADING PATHWAY BY WHICH CIGARETTE SMOKING CONTRIBUTES TO INCREASED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN SMOKERS. ELEVATIONS IN BIOMARKERS OF INFLAMMATION CAN BE DETECTED EARLY, EVEN IN ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS, AS A SUBCLINICAL INDICATOR OF CVD RISK. BASIC SCIENCE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MENTHOL FLAVORING CAN CAUSE INCREASES IN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND DYSFUNCTION BEYOND THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING. HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER MENTHOL CIGARETTE (MC) USE MAY ELEVATE BIOMARKERS OF INFLAMMATION IN SMOKERS AND INCREASE CVD RISK COMPARED TO NON-MENTHOL CIGARETTE (NMC) USE. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE IT IS EXPECTED THAT A MC BAN WILL IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR SMOKERS WHO QUIT OR SWITCH TO NON-COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER THERE WILL BE REDUCTIONS IN INFLAMMATION FOR THOSE WHO SWITCH FROM MC TO NMC SMOKING. IN STUDY 1, WE AIM TO EVALUATE DIFFERENCES IN BIOMARKERS OF SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AND CVD RISK BETWEEN MC AND NMC SMOKERS IN NATIONALLY-REPRESENTATIVE, LONGITUDINAL POPULATION ASSESSMENT OF TOBACCO AND HEALTH (PATH) STUDY. IN STUDY 2, WE AIM TO EXAMINE HOW SWITCHING FROM MC TO NMC SMOKING MAY IMPACT BIOMARKERS OF SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION, SMOKING BEHAVIOR, AND SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES RELATED TO SMOKING. MC SMOKERS (N=68) WILL BE RECRUITED FOR A FIVE-WEEK STUDY, WITH ONE-WEEK OF BASELINE OF MC SMOKING (PHASE 1), FOLLOWED BY FOUR WEEKS OF SWITCHING TO STUDY-PROVIDED, BRAND-MATCHED NMCS (PHASE 2). BIOMARKERS OF SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION (E.G., HSCRP, INTERLEUKIN CYTOKINES) AND TOBACCO EXPOSURE (E.G., COTININE, CARBON MONOXIDE) WILL BE ANALYZED FROM BLOOD SAMPLES BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER SWITCHING. ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA) METHODS WILL ALSO BE GATHERED TO MEASURE PATTERNS OF SMOKING AND SMOKING-RELATED SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT AND DIRECTLY TARGETS FDA'S INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF FLAVORINGS ON THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF TOBACCO USE. THROUGHOUT THE FIVE-YEAR AWARD, DR. JAO WILL BE MENTORED BY AN IMPRESSIVE MENTORSHIP TEAM IN (1) TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN BIOBEHAVIORAL AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF TOBACCO USE, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO BIOMARKERS OF INFLAMMATION AND CVD RISK; (2) LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH METHODS AND ADVANCED STATISTICAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING UTILIZATION OF THE PATH STUDY DATASET AND EMA METHODOLOGY; AND (3) DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN CLINICAL TRIAL STUDIES WITH TOBACCO REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF MC USE ON THESE SENSITIVE SUBCLINICAL BIOMARKERS PRIOR TO CVD DIAGNOSIS CAN HELP THE FDA IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH HAZARDS OF MC USE, PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO MAY CONTINUE TO USE COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES IF A MC BAN IS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FDA.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c3097aef-8c28-5560-7442-592c3de59e18-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01HL164670_7529"}, {"internal_id": 107115561, "Award ID": "K01HL154130", "Award Amount": 722237.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-01", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "NOVEL METHODS FOR EVALUATING THE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE USE WITH CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0f62abfa-f880-18c2-5e58-a64739477e1e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01HL154130_7529"}, {"internal_id": 100874378, "Award ID": "K01HL149053", "Award Amount": 679700.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-03-12", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "CARDIOPULMONARY EFFECTS INDUCED BY ELECTRONIC-CIGARETTE AND JUUL AEROSOLS IN BOTH IN VIVO AND IN VITRO MODELS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "LA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "07ed9f27-c528-e9d5-e332-90c8b04f48b8-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01HL149053_7529"}, {"internal_id": 83115687, "Award ID": "K01HL148907", "Award Amount": 980819.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-13", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "RESPIRATORY EFFECTS OF E-CIGARETTE USE AMONG YOUTH: A PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL INVESTIGATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "56e7333e-38ec-5402-80b8-4d50309afb4c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01HL148907_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110233219, "Award ID": "K01HL147349", "Award Amount": 0.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-09", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF E-CIGARETTE DESIGN ON OXIDANT EXPOSURE AND RELATED HARM BIOMARKERS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "47ed9961-3300-5ed7-bb62-e5359d99eaf9-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01HL147349_7529"}, {"internal_id": 158772688, "Award ID": "K01DA058408", "Award Amount": 182737.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-04-28", "CFDA Number": "93.077", "Description": "USING CAUSAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO INFORM TOBACCO REGULATORY SCIENCE - PROJCT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT INCONSISTENT FINDINGS REGARDING WHETHER AND HOW E-CIGARETTE (EC) USE INFLUENCES SUBSEQUENT TOBACCO USE BEHAVIORS COMPLICATE EVIDENCE-BASED TOBACCO REGULATION. AMONG YOUTH, EC USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER RISK OF TRANSITIONING TO COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTE (CC) SMOKING, BUT ESTIMATED EFFECT SIZES OF EC EXPOSURE VARY SUBSTANTIALLY ACROSS STUDIES. AMONG ADULTS WHO CURRENTLY SMOKE CCS, ECS SHOW POTENTIAL TO HELP QUIT CC SMOKING IN SOME STUDIES BUT NOT IN OTHERS. THESE INCONSISTENT FINDINGS MAY BE DUE IN PART TO A PREPONDERANCE OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES, USE OF SMALL SIZE CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA, AND INADEQUATE CONTROL FOR COVARIATES, FURTHER, DESPITE CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY IN THE SIZE OF ESTIMATED EC EXPOSURE EFFECTS, WHETHER SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS MODIFY THE EC EXPOSURE EFFECTS HAS BEEN LARGELY IGNORED IN LITERATURE. UNDERSTANDING HOW ECS INFLUENCE SUBSEQUENT CC SMOKING, PARTICULARLY AMONG VULNERABLE SUBGROUPS (E.G., AGE, GENDER), AND THEIR INTERSECTIONALITY, WILL HELP INFORM REGULATORY ACTIVITIES THAT ADDRESS TOBACCO-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES. LASTLY, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER ESTIMATED EC EXPOSURE EFFECTS FROM A CERTAIN POPULATION SUBGROUP OR AT A CERTAIN TIME CAN BE GENERALIZED TO DIFFERENT SUBGROUPS OR TIMES. GENERALIZABLE EC EXPOSURE EFFECTS COULD PROVIDE CRITICAL EVIDENCE FOR TOBACCO REGULATORS. TO ADDRESS THESE KNOWLEDGE GAPS, THIS STUDY AIMS TO USE CAUSAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF ECS ON SUBSEQUENT CC SMOKING, IN OVERALL US YOUTH AND ADULT POPULATIONS AND IN VULNERABLE SUBGROUPS, AND TO EXPLORE METHODS FOR ESTIMATING GENERALIZABLE EC EXPOSURE EFFECTS.

THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ELUCIDATE HOW SEX MAY INFLUENCE THE SENSORY PERCEPTION OF THE POPULAR E-CIGARETTE FLAVOR COMPONENTS, SWEETNESS AND COOLING, AND HOW THIS IMPACTS APPEAL AND REINFORCING EFFICACY. WE PLAN TO EXAMINE SENSORY PERCEPTION, APPEAL, REINFORCING EFFICACY OF THREE E-CIGARETTE FLAVORS (SWEET FLAVOR, COOLING FLAVOR, AND UNFLAVORED) IN AN E-CIGARETTE WITH MODERATE NICOTINE CONCENTRATION WHEN PRESENTED ALONE (AIM 1) AND CONCURRENTLY (AIM 2).

NICOTINE SALT-BASED ECS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS DUE TO THEIR HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF NICOTINE, POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR RAPIDLY INCREASING POPULARITY.

WHILE THE PROPOSED PRODUCT STANDARD HAS MERIT, EMERGING RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT IT COULD LEAD TO A PRODUCT THAT IS JUST AS ADDICTIVE BUT MORE HARMFUL, PARTICULARLY TO AFRICAN AMERICAN (AA) SMOKERS. AA SMOKERS BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF SMOKING-RELATED DISEASES AND REPRESENT AN UNDERSTUDIED POPULATION WITH A PROPENSITY TO USE PRODUCTS IN A WAY THAT IS DIFFERENT COMPARED TO THE MAJORITY POPULATION. AA SMOKERS TAKE LARGER PUFFS AND INHALE MORE INTENSELY ON CIGARETTES THAN WHITES. WHILE AA SMOKE FEWER CIGARETTES PER DAY THAN WHITES, AA EXTRACT 30% MORE NICOTINE PER CIGARETTE AND HIGHER LEVELS OF NON-NICOTINE TOXICANTS PER CIGARETTE.

ENACTMENT OF TOBACCO CONTROL POLICIES IS A VITAL RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING EPIDEMIC OF ADOLESCENT E-CIGARETTE USE IN THE US AND IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN YOUTH E-CIGARETTE USE FROM 2019 TO 2020. DURING 2019-2020, TWO FEDERAL LAWS WERE ENACTED: (1) TOBACCO 21 (INCREASED THE MINIMUM LEGAL SALES AGE FOR TOBACCO TO 21 YEARS; T21) AND (2) A PARTIAL FLAVOR RESTRICTION LAW ELIMINATED POD/CARTRIDGE-BASED E-CIGARETTE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAINED FLAVORS OTHER THAN MINT/MENTHOL. WHILE TRADITIONAL POLICY EVALUATIONS (E.G., COMPLIANCE CHECKS, DOCUMENT ANALYSES, AND SURVEYS) HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO EVALUATE POLICY IMPACT, COMPLEMENTARY AND INNOVATIVE SOCIAL MEDIA-BASED METHODOLOGIES CAN BE USED TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE ORGANIC PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT POLICY-RELEVANT ISSUES. SUCH DATA ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE DUE TO THE ABILITY TO UNCOVER CRITICAL POLICY-RELEVANT INFORMATION, TAKING LESS TIME THAN TRADITIONAL METHODOLOGIES. BUILDING ON MY EXPERIENCE AND LEARNING FROM MY RESEARCH MENTORS\u2019 EXPERTISE, I WILL CONDUCT THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE SOCIAL MEDIA ASSESSMENT AIMED AT UNCOVERING HIGHLY VALUABLE YET OFTEN DIFFICULT-TO-ASCERTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING EMERGING TOBACCO ACCESS LAWS (THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ENACTED OR ARE CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED) IN THREE AREAS: POLICY EFFICACY, ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGES, AND INDUSTRY INTERFERENCE. RESEARCH. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION IS TO REDUCE YOUTH/YOUNG ADULT ACCESS TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS. THEREFORE, IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL (1) IDENTIFY LOOPHOLES THAT MAY CIRCUMVENT EMERGING FEDERAL TOBACCO ACCESS LAWS; (2) IDENTIFY KEY CHALLENGES RELATED TO ENFORCEMENT OF FDA REGULATED TOBACCO ACCESS LAWS; AND (3) INVESTIGATE TOBACCO INDUSTRY SUPPORTED INTERFERENCE WITH EMERGING FDA REGULATED TOBACCO ACCESS LAWS. TO ACHIEVE THESE AIMS, WE WILL USE A SPECIALIZED SOFTWARE AND A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF SOCIAL MEDIA-OPTIMIZED SEARCH TERMS TO COLLECT DATA FROM SEVERAL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (E.G., TWITTER, INSTAGRAM, REDDIT, FACEBOOK). USING A TWO-STEP PROCESS, WE WILL ENSURE SEARCH STRINGS ARE COMPREHENSIVE, FEASIBLE, SPECIFIC, AND INFORMAL.

ALMOST 50% OF YOUTH TOBACCO USERS NOW CONCURRENTLY USE TWO OR MORE TOBACCO PRODUCTS\u2014DEFINED AS MULTIPLE TOBACCO PRODUCT (MTP) USE. YOUTH MTP USE IS CONCERNING BECAUSE IT ASSOCIATED WITH A TWO-FOLD INCREASE IN NICOTINE DEPENDENCE SYMPTOMS, DECREASED LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESSFUL QUITTING, AND INCREASED RISK OF OTHER SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. MANY COMMUNICATION MESSAGES EXIST TO WARN YOUTH OF THE HARMS OF SPECIFIC TOBACCO PRODUCTS, LIKE E-CIGARETTES OR CIGARETTES. HOWEVER, ALMOST ALL TOBACCO COMMUNICATION MESSAGES FOCUS ON ONE TOBACCO PRODUCT AT A TIME, WHICH COULD LEAD MTP USERS TO CONSUME THE TOBACCO PRODUCT THAT IS NOT THE TARGET OF THE MESSAGES. MOREOVER, THESE COMMUNICATION MESSAGES MAY NOT WORK WELL WITH MTP USERS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY THAN SINGLE TOBACCO USERS TO UNDERESTIMATE THE HARMS OF TOBACCO, BE MORE DEPENDENT ON NICOTINE, AND BE OF LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (SES). THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROPOSED K01 PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE MESSAGES ABOUT THE HARMS OF MTP USE. THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MTP MESSAGES WILL INCREASE INTENTIONS TO QUIT USING ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS MORE THAN EXISTING MESSAGES THAT FOCUS ONLY ON SINGLE TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND CONTROL MESSAGES. A SECONDARY GOAL IS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF MESSAGES AMONG YOUTH AT HIGHER RISK OF MTP USE, SPECIFICALLY YOUTH OF LOWER SES. IN AIM 1, I WILL IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE THEMES FOR YOUTH-ORIENTED MESSAGES THAT COMMUNICATE THE HARMS OF MTP USE. IN AIM 2, I WILL DEVELOP A SET OF HIGH IMPACT MESSAGES THAT DISCOURAGES MTP USE AMONG YOUTH AND DETERMINE WHETHER OTHER MESSAGE ELEMENTS (E.G., TESTIMONIALS, QUITTING APPROACH, SELF-EFFICACY CUE) INCREASE TOBACCO QUIT INTENTIONS USING A DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENT (DCE) WITH YOUTH MTP USERS. FINALLY, IN AIM 3, I WILL CONDUCT A THREE-ARM PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) WITH YOUTH MTP USERS (50% LOWER SES) TO SEE IF THE MTP MESSAGES DELIVERED AS TEXT MESSAGES OVER A TWO-WEEK PERIOD INCREASE TOBACCO QUIT INTENTIONS MORE THAN EXISTING MESSAGES THAT FOCUS ONLY ON SINGLE TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND CONTROL MESSAGES.

THIS STUDY WILL PRODUCE EVIDENCE, USING A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDARD, ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CIGARETTE-ORIENTED CONTROL POLICIES ON COPD TRENDS TO INFORM FDA TOBACCO REGULATIONS. THE PROJECT HAS THREE AIMS. AIM 1: DETERMINING THE IMPACT OF LONGITUDINAL CHANGES IN SMOKING BEHAVIOR ON LUNG FUNCTION AND COPD MORTALITY: A MARKOV MODEL ANALYSIS. USING DATA FROM THE COPDGENE COHORT, I WILL ASSESS HOW CHANGES IN SMOKING BEHAVIORS IMPACT THE LUNG FUNCTION DECLINE AND MORTALITY OF TOBACCO ASSOCIATED COPD.
