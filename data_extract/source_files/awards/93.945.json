IN 2021, HOSPITALIZATIONS DUE TO ARTHRITIS WERE ESTIMATED TO COST $82 MILLION. FORTY-TWO PERCENT OF WORKING-AGE ADULTS WITH ARTHRITIS REPORTED THEIR SYMPTOMS INTERFERE WITH THE TYPE OR AMOUNT OF WORK THEY DO. ARTHRITIS IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH OREGON\u2019S LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH, INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, STROKE, AND DIABETES. THIRTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF THOSE WHO ARE 55 TO 64 YEARS OF AGE AND 50% OF THOSE 65 YEARS AND OLDER HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH ARTHRITIS. ABOUT 29% OF OREGONIANS (1.4 MILLION) ARE MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES WHO SUFFER HIGHER RATES OF ARTHRITIS (29%, AGE-ADJUSTED) COMPARED TO NON-MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES (21%, AGE-ADJUSTED). THOSE IN RURAL AND FRONTIER AREAS ALSO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF ARTHRITIS (34%) COMPARED TO THOSE IN URBAN AREAS (27%).  PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASE AND CAN DECREASE PAIN AND IMPROVE FUNCTION BY ABOUT 40% FOR ADULTS WITH ARTHRITIS. THERE ARE SPECIFIC SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS LISTED BY THE OSTEOARTHRITIS ACTION ALLIANCE AS ARTHRITIS APPROPRIATE EVIDENCE BASED IMPLEMENTATIONS (AAEBIS), WHICH ARE PROGRAMS PROVEN TO HELP THOSE SUFFERING FROM ARTHRITIS; FIVE OF THESE AAEBIS ARE COVERED BY MEDICAID IN OREGON.

IN ADDITION, MIBRFSS DATA INDICATE LONG-TERM TRENDS IN ARTHRITIS PREVALENCE INCREASING WITH AGE (FROM 4.6% OF THOSE AGE 18-24, TO 57.3% OF THOSE AGE 75 AND OLDER) AND LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (FROM 23.2% OF PEOPLE WITH INCOME = 75K, TO 38.8% OF THOSE WITH HOUSEHOLD INCOME UNDER 20K).

PHASE II ?

THE PRIMARY DEMOGRAPHIC WITHIN THE PUBLIC AUDIENCE, TO BE TARGETED WITH AWARENESS INFORMATION, ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH CANCER (WHO ARE AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF DEVELOPING LE) WHO HAVE NOT YET HAD SURGICAL INTERVENTION.
