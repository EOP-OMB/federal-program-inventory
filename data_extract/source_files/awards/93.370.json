THE TEVG IS MADE BY SEEDING AUTOLOGOUS BONE MARROW-DERIVED MONONUCLEAR CELLS ONTO A BIODEGRADABLE TUBULAR SCAFFOLD. ONCE IMPLANTED THE SCAFFOLD DEGRADES AND THE TEVG TRANSFORMS INTO A NEOVESSEL THAT RESEMBLES A NATIVE BLOOD VESSEL BOTH IN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION. RESULTS OF THE FIRST FDA- APPROVED CLINICAL TRIAL EVALUATING THE USE OF THE TEVG IN CHILDREN DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TEVG IS THE FIRST MAN- MADE VASCULAR CONDUIT THAT GROWS MAKING IT UNIQUELY SUITED FOR USE IN THE SURGICAL REPAIR OF COMPLEX CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS, HOWEVER; RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT INCIDENCE OF STENOSIS WAS TOO HIGH TO RECOMMEND ROUTINE USE OF THIS PROMISING TECHNOLOGY. WE SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED AN IMPROVED, SECOND- GENERATION TEVG THAT INCORPORATES BOTH RATIONALLY DESIGNED STRATEGIES FOR INHIBITING THE FORMATION OF TEVG STENOSIS AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT MEASURES FOR ASSEMBLING THE TEVG, IN ADDITION TO NEWER LESS STRINGENT CRITERIA FOR PERFORMING TEVG ANGIOPLASTY.

IN THIS STUDY, WE WILL EVALUATE THE SHORT-TERM (2 YEAR) SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF A SECOND-GENERATION TEVG FOR USE AS AN EXTRACARDIAC CONDUIT IN CHILDREN WITH SINGLE VENTRICLE CARDIAC ANOMALIES UNDERGOING MODIFIED FONTAN SURGERY. WE WILL SERIALLY MONITOR ALL GRAFT RECIPIENTS OVER A 2-YEAR TIME COURSE USING ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY AND MRI.

EARLY AMD PATHOGENESIS INVOLVES ATROPHY OF THE RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM (RPE) WITH ACCOMPANYING LOSS OF RETINAL FUNCTION AND VISION. ALTHOUGH THERAPY IS AVAILABLE FOR EXUDATIVE (WET) AMD, AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE MORE COMMON NON- EXUDATIVE (DRY) AMD FORM. PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL (PSC)-DERIVED RPE (PSC-RPE) TRANSPLANTATION HAS SHOWN PROMISE FOR AMD IN EARLY CLINICAL TRIALS. DUE TO THE HIGHLY PROLIFERATIVE AND PLASTIC NATURE OF PSC, HOWEVER, EXTENSIVE DIFFERENTIATION TO RPE IS NEEDED PRIOR TO TRANSPLANTATION TO AVOID TUMOR GROWTH AND GENOTYPE INSTABILITY INHERENT TO THE PSC SOURCE. WE DISCOVERED AN ADULT RPE STEM CELL (RPESC) WITH RESTRICTED PROLIFERATIVE AND LINEAGE POTENTIAL. RPESC-DERIVED RPE (RPESC- RPE) DO NOT FORM TUMOR ENABLING TRANSPLANTATION OF LESS DIFFERENTIATED RPE AT THE PROGENITOR STAGE.

WHILE PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ACUTE ADVERSE REPONES, THE LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS FOR POST-ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION (I/R) PATIENTS REMAINS POOR. DUE TO THE LIMITED REGENERATIVE CAPACITY OF HUMAN HEARTS, HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL-DERIVED CARDIOMYOCYTES (HPSC-CMS) HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION DUE TO THEIR PROVEN CAPACITY TO RESTORE CONTRACTILE FUNCTION UPON TRANSPLANTATION TO INJURED HEARTS IN VARIOUS MAMMALIAN MODELS, LEADING TO MULTIPLE ONGOING CLINICAL TRIALS. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT TRANSPLANTATION APPROACH MAINLY RELIES ON DISSOCIATED HPSC-CMS, LEADING TO LOW CELL SURVIVAL, MODERATE FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENT, ARRHYTHMOGENIC RISK, AND POOR SCALABILITY. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, OUR LAB DEVELOPED NANOWIRED, PRE- VASCULARIZED HUMAN CARDIAC ORGANOIDS COMPOSED OF HPSC-CMS, HUMAN PRIMARY CARDIAC FIBROBLASTS, ENDOTHELIAL CELLS, STROMAL CELLS, AND ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE SILICON NANOWIRES (E-SINWS). ENDOTHELIAL CELLS ARE USED TO INDUCE VASCULATURE FORMATION WITHIN THE ORGANOIDS, AND E-SINWS ARE ADDED TO CREATE AN ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE MICROENVIRONMENT TO FACILITATE HPSC-CM CONTRACTILE DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR ELECTRICAL INTEGRATION WITH THE HOST MYOCARDIUM.

SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO DRY MOUTH. DECREASED PRODUCTION OF SALIVA IS CALLED HYPOSALIVATION. POOR QUALITY AND FUNCTION OF SALIVA IS CALLED SALIVARY DYSFUNCTION. TOGETHER, THESE CAUSE XEROSTOMIA, OR WHAT A PATIENT EXPERIENCES AS SIMPLY DRY MOUTH. XEROSTOMIA CAN LEAD TO TOOTH DECAY, INFECTIONS, DIFFICULTY SPEAKING, IMPAIRED SWALLOWING, POOR NUTRITION, AND HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON QUALITY OF LIFE. DOCTORS RECOMMEND THAT PATIENTS SUCK ON HARD CANDY, CHEW GUM, USE SALIVA SUBSTITUTES, AND/OR CARRY A WATER BOTTLE WITH THEM AT ALL TIMES. NONE OF THESE ARE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM RADIATION-INDUCED DRY MOUTH TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCER. WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL BY PROVIDING CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT INNOVATIVE CELLULAR THERAPIES CAN SAFELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM SALIVARY GLAND DYSFUNCTION. THE TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS TACKLING THIS PROJECT IS UNIQUELY SUITED TO COMPLETE THE WORK. SUCCESS WOULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO THE NEXT PHASE OF CLINICAL TESTING. WE HAVE EXPERTISE IN CARING FOR HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS, DEVELOPING MINOR SALIVARY GLAND DERIVED MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS (MSCS) AS CELLULAR THERAPIES, AND STUDYING SALIVARY FUNCTION. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO PLAN AND PREPARE FOR A PHASE 1 TRIAL TO TEST THE SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF IFN-G PRE-LICENSED MINOR SALIVARY GLAND DERIVED MSCS FOR PREVENTION OF RADIATION-INDUCED XEROSTOMIA IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS. TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS, WE PROPOSE A MILESTONE-BASED PROJECT IN WHICH WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE NIH AND FDA TO FINALIZE STUDY DESIGN FOR A PHASE 1 SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY STUDY, COMPLETE THE CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL, AND SUBMIT REGULATORY DOCUMENTS IN AIM 1. IN AIM 2, WE WILL COMPLETE ALL NECESSARY MILESTONES TO ACTIVATE THE PROPOSED CLINICAL TRIAL INCLUDING SAFETY SYSTEMS, DATA SYSTEMS, AND SITE STAFF AND FACILITY PREPARATION TO ENSURE A SMOOTH OPENING TO THE PLANNED CLINICAL TRIAL.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f044e52c-101e-349e-69e4-aaa93e72f7ab-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R34DE033042_7529"}]
