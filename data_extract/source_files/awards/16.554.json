BJS PROVIDES DIRECT FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE STATES TO IMPROVE CRIMINAL HISTORY AND OTHER RELATED RECORDS AND TO BUILD THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONNECT TO NATIONAL RECORD CHECK SYSTEMS BOTH TO SUPPLY INFORMATION AND TO CONDUCT THE REQUISITE CHECKS.  UNDER THE FY 20 NCHIP PROJECT, THE NEBRASKA STATE PATROL WILL USE FUNDS TO IMPROVE THE REPORTING OF DISPOSITIONS AND OF PERSONS PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING FIREARMS FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS, AND INCREASE THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF RECORDS AVAILABLE TO THE NATIONAL CRIMINAL INSTANT BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM (NICS), NEXT GENERATION IDENTIFICATION (NGI), AND THE INTERSTATE IDENTIFICATION INDEX (III).  TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVE THE NSP WILL FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE ADVANCED AD HOC REPORTING SYSTEM WITHIN THE PATROL CRIMINAL HISTORY (PCH) TO ALLOW AUTHORIZED USERS ACCESS TO NEEDED REPORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER AND UPGRADING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT MESSAGE SWITCH (LEMS) TECHNOLOGY. THE APPLICATIONS DEVELOPER TO CONDUCT THESE UPGRADES IS INTEGRAL TO THE PLANNING, LAUNCHING, TROUBLESHOOTING, AND ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS.  FURTHER, THE NSP WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS BASE AND EXPANSION PROJECTS. THIS PROJECT WILL BE DONE BY TWO (2) RECORDS TECHNICIANS UPDATING HISTORICAL RECORDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INQUIRIES SCREENING PROJECT WHERE NSP CONTINUES THE RESEARCH OF PRE-2000 RECORDS WITH MISSING DISPOSITIONS.  CONTINUING FROM FY2019 NCHIP, THE DUPCHECK (DUPLICATE CHECK) AND AFIS-PCH SYNC PROJECTS WILL DETERMINE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS AND REQUIRE RESEARCH AND CORRECTIONS BY FINGERPRINT TECHNICIANS. BOTH PROJECTS WILL INCREASE ACCURACY IN THE AFIS AND PCH SYSTEMS.  ADDITIONALLY, NSP WILL CONTINUE THE QUALITY ASSURANCE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (QAIP) STAFF WHERE EACH OF NEBRASKA\u2019S 93 COUNTIES ARE BEING ASSESSED EVERY TWO-THREE YEARS, RESULTING IN MORE COHESIVE PROCEDURES TO INCREASE THE TIMELINESS, ACCURACY, AND COMPLETENESS OF CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS. NSP WILL ALSO CONVERT ARREST CHARGES BASED ON A STATUTE BASED CODING SYSTEM TO IMPROVE THE CONSISTENCY OF INFORMATION REPORTED STATEWIDE. THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT INVOLVES THE NSP, ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE COURTS, NEBRASKA CRIME COMMISSION, AND LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES.  FURTHER, NSP WILL ADD A NEW PCH/JUSTICE COORDINATOR POSITION THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE JUSTICE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND PCH. THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF THIS POSITION IS ULTIMATELY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MORE FREQUENT AND COMPLETE COMMUNICATION OF COURT INFORMATION VIA JUSTICE TO PCH. IN COLLABORATION WITH NEBRASKA\u2019S ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE COURTS, THE NSP WILL CONTINUE A PROJECT ORIGINALLY FUNDED UNDER THE NCHIP 19 AWARD TO COMPLETE PROGRAMMING THAT WILL MODERNIZE AND STREAMLINE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.   DUE TO ONGOING COVID RESTRICTIONS, THE NSP DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ATTENDING THE SEARCH CONFERENCE OR COMPACT COUNCIL MEETINGS, AND WILL REDUCE THE QUANTITY OF IN-PERSON QAIP VISITS BY HALF. IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE COMPLEX NATURE OF CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS AND NOT CURRENTLY HAVING AN INTERESTED APPLICANT IN THE QAIP PROGRAM MANAGER POSITION, THE NSP WILL FIRST HIRE ADDITIONAL AUDITORS TO

HISTORY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (NCHIP) IS TO IMPROVE THE NATION'S SAFETY AND SECURITY BY ENHANCING THE QUALITY, COMPLETENESS, AND ACCESSIBILITY OF CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD INFORMATION AND BY INSURING THE NATIONWIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND NONCRIMINAL JUSTICE BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEMS. BJS PROVIDES DIRECT FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE STATES TO IMPROVE CRIMINAL HISTORY AND OTHER RELATED RECORDS AND TO BUILD THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONNECT TO NATIONAL RECORD CHECK SYSTEMS BOTH TO SUPPLY INFORMATION AND TO CONDUCT THE REQUISITE CHECKS.\n\nUNDER THE 2020 NCHIP PRIORITY AREA 1, FOR UPDATING AND AUTOMATING CASE OUTCOMES IN STATE RECORDS AND THE FBI\u0092S CRIMINAL HISTORY FILE, THE VIRGINIA STATE POLICE (VSP) WILL CONDUCT TWO PROJECTS TO CONTRIBUTE INFORMATION TO THE NICS. SPECIFICALLY, 1) THE VA COMPUTERIZED CRIMINAL HISTORY (CCH) REPLACEMENT PROJECT; AND 2) THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES (CJIS) DIVISION AND CENTRAL CRIMINAL RECORDS EXCHANGE (CCRE) ASSESSMENT AND ENHANCEMENT PROJECT.\n\nVCCH REPLACEMENT: THE CURRENT SYSTEM HAS SEVERAL DEFECTS INCLUDING ONE MAJOR ISSUE IN PROPER VALIDATION OF CRIMINAL COURT DISPOSITION INFORMATION RECEIVED ELECTRONICALLY FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF VA (SCV), WHICH IS CAUSING DELAYS IN AUTOMATICALLY POSTING DISPOSITIONS TO THE CRIMINAL HISTORY. THE NUMBER OF DEFECTS IN THE CURRENT CCH SYSTEM IS AFFECTING MANY REPORTING FUNCTIONS THAT CAUSE DELAYS AND INACCURATE RECORDS IN THE STATE SYSTEMS THAT SUBSEQUENTLY DELAY THE RELEVANT RECORDS SUBMITTED TO III, NCIC AND NICS INDICES. THE PROJECT ACTIVITIES INCLUDE HIRING A VENDOR TO COMPLETE TWO PHASES: DETAILED REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW CCH SYSTEM AND DETAILED DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM. THE VSP WILL FIRST MEET WITH SEARCH TO DETERMINE AND ORGANIZE THE DETAILED REQUIREMENTS AND DETAILED DESIGNS OF THE CCH SYSTEM. THE DETAILED REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGNS INCLUDE DEFINING CCH SOLUTION CONFIGURATIONS AND CUSTOMIZATIONS RELATED TO WORKFLOWS, INFRASTRUCTURE, INTERFACES, DATA CONVERSION, DATA QUALITY, AND SYSTEM GENERATED REPORTS.  \n\nCJIS DIVISION AND CCRE ASSESSMENT: THE CCRE IS LOCATED AT VSP AND IS THE SOLE CENTRAL REPOSITORY FOR CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION IN VA. CCRE RECEIVES CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, COURTS, VDOC, AND VA PROBATION AND PAROLE IN ADDITION TO OTHER SOURCES AND AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE COMMONWEALTH. VSP WILL USE NCHIP FUNDS TO HIRE TWO CONTRACTORS TO ASSESS AND ENHANCE THE CURRENT CCRE, AFIS, VIRGINIA LIVE-SCAN, VCIN, SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY (SOR), AND FIREARM TRANSACTION CENTER (FTC) PRODUCTION PROCESSES. THE CONTRACTORS WILL REDEVELOP AND OR BUILD NEW PROCESSES TO MEET QUALITY AND STREAMLINED REQUIREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS, AND TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT NEW OR MODIFIED BUSINESS PROCESSES. THE TWO POSITIONS TO BE HIRED ARE A PROCESS IMPROVEMENT ENGINEER AND A BUSINESS PROCESS ANALYST. ACTIVITIES FOR THE PROJECT INCLUDE: DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT OFFICE TO ACHIEVE CJIS STRATEGIC GOALS BY SELECTING, PRIORITIZING, ASSESSING, AND MANAGING PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS; PROVIDING LEADERSHIP MANAGEMENT; AND CONDUCTING TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.\n\n(CA/NCF)", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VA", "COVID-19 Obligations":
