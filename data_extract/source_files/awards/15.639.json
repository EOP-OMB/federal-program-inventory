VOLUNTEER HARVEST SUBMISSIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN DUE TO THE PRIVATE NATURE OF THE CHEROKEE CULTURE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NON INVASIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUES AND NOVEL ANALYSIS METHODS NOW AVAILABLE THAT CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THE SAME TYPES OF DATA AS INVASIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUES WHILE ENSURING SAFETY AND SOCIO POLITICAL ISSUES REMAIN UNDISTURBED. THE EASTERN BAND OF CHEROKEE INDIANS OFFICE OF FISHERIES AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP SEVERAL NON INVASIVE TECHNIQUES TO WORK TOWARDS ANSWERING SOME OF THE SAME QUESTIONS INVASIVE SAMPLING WOULD ANSWER. WE HAVE CATEGORIZED THESE TECHNIQUES INTO MOLECULAR AND TECHNOLOGICAL. SOME NON INVASIVE MOLECULAR SAMPLING TECHNIQUES INCLUDE  DNA SAMPLING IN STREAMS AND BOGS FOR RARE FISH, HELLBENDER SALAMANDERS AND BOG TURTLES, HAIR SNARES FOR BEAR POPULATION DYNAMICS, ASSESSMENT OF BEAR NUISANCE ISSUES FROM SWABBING, FOR FECAL MARK RECAPTURE OF FLYING SQUIRRELS AND BATS  ENVIRONMENTAL DNA FOR DETECTION OF AQUATIC SPECIES LIKE SICKLEFIN REDHORSE AND HELLBENDER SALAMANDERS  HAIR SNARES FOR AMERICAN BLACK BEARS, AND FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF BEAR HUMAN CONFLICT AREAS. OUR TECHNOLOGICAL METHODS INCLUDE  CAMERA TRAP SAMPLING FOR GAME SPECIES (I.E. BEARS, WILD HOGS, COYOTES, BOBCATS, TURKEY. GROUSE) AND NON GAME RARE OR PROTECTED SPECIES (I.E. CAROLINA NORTHERN FLYING SQUIRRELS, SPOTTED SKUNKS, ARMADILLOS, ELK, DEER)  AND ACOUSTIC SAMPLING FOR BATS, BIRDS AND AMPHIBIANS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE ADDING GUIDED CAMERA SURVEYS SUCH AS UNDERWATER PROBES FOR HELLBENDERS AND DRONE SAMPLING FOR HABITAT EVALUATION AND SEARCHING FOR ELK CALVES IN REMOTE AREAS. NON INVASIVE SAMPLING HAS LOW IMPACTS BUT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE TRAINING IN METHODS DEPLOYMENT, DATA MANAGEMENT AND SEVERAL HIGH LEVEL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS, WILL REQUIRE FUNDING FOR CONTRACTUAL SAMPLING, EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, TRAVEL, AND TRAINING. THESE TOOLS AND PROCESSES WILL NOT ONLY HELP US UNDERSTAND NEEDS TO PROTECT AND RESTORE IMPORTANT SPECIES, THEY WILL HELP THE CHEROKEE COMMUNITY, UNDER FEDERAL REGULATORY NEEDS, MAINTAIN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INDEPENDENCE AS A SOVEREIGN NATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "153cbecc-9a75-8004-e463-d8c27a478331-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F23AP00593_1448"}, {"internal_id": 156520713, "Award ID": "F23AP00549", "Award Amount": 62327.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-02-06", "CFDA Number": "15.639", "Description": "THE BAD RIVER BAND OF THE LAKE SUPERIOR TRIBE OF CHIPPEWA INDIANS IS LOCATED ON 125,000  ACRES, PRIMARILY LOWLANDS, IN RURAL NORTHERN WISCONSIN ALONG 36 MILES OF THE SOUTHERN SHORELINE OF GICHIGUMI (LAKE SUPERIOR).

LIKE MANY OTHER TRIBES, THIS CONNECTION INVOLVES THE USE OF TRADITIONALLY IMPORTANT UNGULATE SPECIES SUCH AS MULE DEER, ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK, AND PRONGHORN. BECAUSE THESE SPECIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL RELEVANCE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE PUEBLO TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE POPULATIONS ON THEIR LANDS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. A CHALLENGE TO THIS, IS BALANCING THE PREDATOR PREY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN INCREASING MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION AND LOW DENSITY, ISOLATED UNGULATE POPULATIONS. ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS THAT, LIKE UNGULATES, MOUNTAIN LIONS ARE ALSO A TRADITIONALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES, SO SIMPLY REMOVING ALL LIONS FROM THE PUEBLO IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION. IT IS CLEAR TO THE PUEBLO, THAT TO INCREASE UNGULATE POPULATIONS ON ITS LAND, IT MUST INCREASE ITS UNGULATE REPRODUCTION POTENTIAL BY PROTECTING BOTH ADULT AND NEONATE UNGULATES FROM MOUNTAIN LION PREDATION AND IDENTIFY AND PROTECT CORRIDORS USED BY UNGULATES TO MEET THEIR ANNUAL NEEDS, OR FOR DISPERSAL OR IMMIGRATION ONTO THE PUEBLO. BECAUSE REMOVING MOUNTAIN LIONS THAT DEMONSTRATE A PROPENSITY TO SELECT UNGULATE SPECIES AS PREY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE LOW DENSITY UNGULATE POPULATIONS, THE PUEBLO NEEDS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHICH LIONS ARE SELECTING UNGULATES SO THAT IT CAN PRESENT THIS INFORMATION TO THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AND TRADITIONAL LEADERS FOR THEM TO MAKE INFORMED MANAGEMENT DECISIONS REGARDING THE FATE OF SUCH INDIVIDUAL LIONS. HOWEVER, BEFORE THIS CAN HAPPEN, PREDATION DATA WILL NEED TO BE COLLECTED TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL LIONS THAT ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING UNGULATE POPULATIONS.

EACH LYNX WAS SEXED, AGED, ASSESSED FOR HEALTH AND FIT WITH A GPS RADIO COLLAR.  AFTER BEING TRANSPORTED ACROSS THE CANADIAN BORDER THE LYNX WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE COLVILLE INDIAN RESERVATION WHERE THEY WERE RELEASED IN ONE OF TWO AREAS THAT HAD BEEN CONSIDERED SUITABLE HABITAT.

THEY HAVE ENDURED THROUGH THE CENTURIES BY MAINTAINING THEIR TRADITIONAL, CULTURAL, AND SPIRITUAL WAYS THAT ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THEIR CONNECTION TO THE NATURAL WORLD. LIKE MANY OTHER TRIBES, THIS CONNECTION INVOLVES THE USE OF TRADITIONALLY IMPORTANT WILDLIFE SUCH AS MULE DEER (ODOCOILEUS HEMIONUS), ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK (CERVUS ELAPHUS), PRONGHORN (ANTILOCAPRA AMERICANA), BLACK BEAR (URSUS AMERICANUS), AND MOUNTAIN LION (PUMA CONCOLOR).BECAUSE THESE SPECIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL RELEVANCE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE PUEBLO TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE POPULATIONS ON THEIR LANDS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. A CHALLENGE TO THIS IS THAT WILDLIFE MOVEMENT AND WILDLIFE-VEHICLE COLLISION DATA SHOWED THAT MOVEMENT CORRIDORS FOR THESE SPECIES ARE AFFECTED BY TWO MAJOR ROADWAYS THAT BISECT THE PUEBLO.THIS WAS RECENTLY CONFIRMED BY STATE OF NEW MEXICO WHEN THEY CLASSIFIED THE SANDIA-JEMEZ MOUNTAIN CORRIDOR AS ONE OF THE TOP 10 HABITAT LINKAGES IN THE STATE THAT ARE THREATENED BY ROADS- AND THIS LINKAGE RUNS STRAIGHT THROUGH THE PUEBLO. THIS CLASSIFICATION PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUEBLO TO WORK WITH STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS TO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT WILDLIFE-VEHICLE COLLISION MITIGATION PROJECTS (WVCMP) THAT PROTECT MOTORISTS AND PROMOTE WILDLIFE CONNECTIVITY. HOWEVER, BEFORE THIS CAN HAPPEN, DATA WILL NEED TO BE COLLECTED TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY WILDLIFE USE OF EXISTING BRIDGES AND CULVERTS TO CROSS ROADWAYS.THEREFORE, THE PUEBLO IS PROPOSING TO 1) DEVELOP A WILDLIFE CROSSING BASELINE DATASET THAT CAN BE USED TO HELP IN THE DESIGN OF FUTURE WVCMPS, 2) IMPROVE MOTORIST'S ABILITY TO DETECT AND AVOID COLLIDING WITH WILDLIFE IN KNOWN WILDLIFE-VEHICLE COLLISION HOTSPOTS, AND 3) GARNER SUPPORT FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR FUTURE CONSTRUCTION OF WVCMPS ON THEIR LAND.
