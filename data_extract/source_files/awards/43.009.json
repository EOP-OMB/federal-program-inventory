AS THE TRANSMIT HALF OF A BISTATIC RADAR LINK. THE RECEIVE HALF OF THE LINK IS A CUSTOMIZED GNSS RECEIVER DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS. THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART IN THESE RECEIVERS AT THE TRL-6 OR HIGHER LEVEL IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE SCIENCE PAYLOAD CARRIED ON NASA S CYGNSS MISSION CONSTELLATION OF SMALL SATELLITES. THIS RECEIVER DEMONSTRATED  DURING A RECENT TRL RAISING TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION MISSION  THAT IT IS CAPABLE OF MEASURING OCEAN SURFACE WINDS  NEAR SURFACE SOIL MOISTURE  SEA SURFACE HEIGHT (ALTIMETRY)  AND POLAR ICE EXTENT FROM LOW EARTH ORBIT. THE CURRENT RECEIVER CAN ONLY PROCESS AT MOST FOUR SIMULTANEOUS MEASUREMENTS AND CAN ONLY USE THE L1 SIGNAL TRANSMITTED BY THE GPS SATELLITE CONSTELLATION. THE USE OF ONLY L1 SIGNALS LIMITS THE HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION (FOR OCEAN WIND  SOIL MOISTURE AND ICE EXTENT APPLICATIONS) AND THE VERTICAL RESOLUTION (FOR ALTIMETRY). THE PROCESSING OF AT MOST FOUR SIGNALS AND ONLY FROM GPS SATELLITES LIMITS THE SPATIAL SAMPLING AND REVISIT TIME FOR ALL APPLICATIONS. A NEXT GENERATION GNSS BISTATIC RADAR RECEIVER WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT IS CAPABLE OF PROCESSING SIGNALS TRANSMITTED BY BOTH GPS AND GALILEO SATELLITES  INCLUDING BOTH LOW (L1/E1) AND HIGH (L5/E5) BANDWIDTH SIGNALS. THE RECEIVER WILL ALSO BE CAPABLE OF PROCESSING BETWEEN 7 (MINIMUM) AND 14 (GOAL) SIMULTANEOUS SIGNALS. AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THESE HARDWARE AND FIRMWARE DEVELOPMENTS  HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION WILL BE IMPROVED BY A FACTOR OF THREE  VERTICAL RESOLUTION BY A FACTOR OF TEN  AND SPATIAL COVERAGE AND REVISIT TIME BY A FACTOR OF TWO (MINIMUM) TO FOUR (GOAL). IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT OF THESE PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENTS ON THE SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF REMOTELY SENSED GEOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES  THE IMPROVEMENTS RANGE FROM SIGNIFICANT BUT INCREMENTAL TO FUNDAMENTALLY ENABLING. EXAMPLES OF SIGNIFICANT INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE MEASUREMENT OF OCEAN SURFACE WINDS AND ICE EXTENT. THE IMPROVED SPATIAL RESOLUTION WILL  FOR EXAMPLE  ENABLE FINER SPATIAL SCALE STRUCTURE TO BE RESOLVED IN STORMS AND SMALLER LEADS AND TONGUES TO BE IMAGED AT THE POLAR ICE EDGE. EXAMPLES OF ENABLING IMPROVEMENTS ARE IN THE AREAS OF SEA LEVEL CHANGE AND FLOOD PREDICTION. THE ABILITY TO MEASURE SEA SURFACE HEIGHT WITH 10X HIGHER ACCURACY WILL PLACE GNSS METHODS IN THE SAME GENERAL RANGE OF PERFORMANCE AS EXISTING SATELLITE ALTIMETER MISSIONS. THE ABILITY TO MEASURE SOIL MOISTURE WITH HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION WILL ENABLE SOIL SATURATION MONITORING DURING POTENTIAL FLASH FLOOD EVENTS. IN THESE AND OTHER WAYS  THE NEXT GENERATION GNSS BISTATIC RADAR RECEIVER WILL ENABLE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN CLIMATE STUDIES  WEATHER MONITORING AND PREDICTION  DISASTER MANAGEMENT  AND USES BY COMMERCIAL MARITIME ORGANIZATIONS.

THE KEY OBJECTIVES ARE ENGRAINED IN BOTH PROOF-OF-CONCEPT  AND DEVELOPMENT OF A TECHNIQUE TO MAKE THIS MEASUREMENT AROUND A DYNAMIC CONICAL FEATURE CALLED A TAYLOR CONE. LITERATURE SHOWS THAT THE TECHNIQUE  CALLED ELECTRON HOLOGRAPHY  HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED TO MEASURE THE ELECTRIC FIELD OF SIMILAR SIZED SOLID FEATURES. THERE IS ALSO LITERATURE THAT PROVES IMAGING OF TAYLOR CONES IS POSSIBLE IN THE TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE USED FOR ELECTRON HOLOGRAPHY. THIS RESEARCH  WOULD THEREFORE BRIDGE THIS GAP IN LITERATURE AND PROVIDE A EXPERIMENTAL DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS SEEN IN RECENT ELECTRIC PROPULSION MODELINGAND EXPERIMENTS.THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WILL BE TESTED IN THIS EXPERIMENT IS THE FOLLOWING  IF AN OPERATING IONIC LIQUID TAYLOR CONE SUBJECTED TO CHANGES IN THE LOCAL ELECTRIC FIELD  THEN THE MEASURED EMISSION CURRENT WILL FOLLOW A PROPORTIONAL TREND WITH RESPECT TO AN INCREASE IN ELECTRIC FIELD.IN ORDER TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS  THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS MUST BE ANSWERED: 1) HOW DOES THE ASPECT RATIO OF THESE SHARP TIPS AFFECT THE FORMATION OF THE TAYLOR CONE?2) IS IT POSSIBLE TO MEASURE THE SPATIAL ELECTRIC FIELD IN THE NEAR FIELD OF AN OPERATING TAYLOR CONE?3) HOW DO VARIATIONS IN THE LOCAL ELECTRIC FIELD AFFECT THE OPERATION OF AN IONIC LIQUID ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTER?TO ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION THREE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED USING THE TWO IN SITU VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED. THE EXPERIMENTS WILL USE A HITACHI S4700 FIELD-EMISSION SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (FE-SEM)  A FEI TITAN 80-300 ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (E-TEM) WITH AN INTEGRATED MOLLENSTEDT BIPRISM  AND A JEOL JEM-4000FX TRANSMISSION ELECTRONMICROSCOPE (TEM)  RESPECTIVELY. I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE FE-SEM EXPERIMENTS USING AN UNCOATED SHARP TUNGSTEN TIP AS THE CATHODE. THE FIRST TEM EXPERIMENT WILL USE THE ELECTRON HOLOGRAPHY TECHNIQUE TO IMAGE THE SPATIAL ELECTRIC FIELD IN THE REGION AROUND AN UNCOATED TUNGSTEN TIP OF VARYING TIP RADII. THESE TEM RESULTS WILL THEN BE USED AS A MEANS OF COMPARISON FOR THE SEM MICROGRAPHS. FROM THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO EXPERIMENTS WILL HELP IN SELECTING THE PROPER RANGE OF TIP RADII FOR USE IN THE COATED TIPEXPERIMENTS. THE SECOND TEM EXPERIMENT WILL IMPLEMENT AN IONIC-LIQUID-COATED TUNGSTEN TIP TO PRODUCE AND IMAGE A STABLE TAYLOR CONE. MULTIPLE TIPS WITH VARYING TIP RADII WILL BE TESTING UNTIL A TAYLOR CONE FORMATION IS DEMONSTRATED. AS SUCH  THIS TEM EXPERIMENTWILL FOCUS ON IMAGING AN IONIC LIQUID TAYLOR CONE FORMING ON A TUNGSTEN TIP AND WILL NOT USE ANY ELECTRIC FIELD MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES.TO ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION THE FEI TITAN 80-300 E-TEM WILL BE USED TO RUN EXPERIMENTS ON OPERATING IONIC LIQUID TAYLOR CONES. THE ELECTRON HOLOGRAPHY TECHNIQUE WILL BE USED AGAIN  THIS TIME TO IMAGE THE SPATIAL ELECTRIC FIELD SURROUNDING STABLE TAYLOR CONES.ONCE VISUALIZATION OF THE ELECTRIC FIELD AROUND OPERATION TAYLOR CONES IS DEMONSTRATED  IMAGES WILL BE TAKEN AT DIFFERENT APPLIED VOLTAGES TO MEASURE THE DETERMINE HOW A CHANGE IN THE ELECTRIC FIELD AFFECTS THE OPERATION OF A TAYLOR CONE.

THE UTILIZATION OF THIS TYPE OF HAND AND WRIST EXOSKELETON COULD IMPROVE THE DEXTERITY OF THE OPERATOR WHILE COMBATING THE EFFECTS OF FATIGUE ALLOWING FOR LONGER  MORE EFFECTIVE  AND SAFER MISSIONS INVOLVING EXTRA-VEHICULAR ACTIVITY. THE ORIGINAL IMPETUS FOR AN ADAPTIVE CONTROL AROSE OUT OF ADVANCEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF REHABILITATION ROBOTICS  SPECIFICALLY IN STROKE AND SPINAL CORD INJURY REHABILITATION. MANY OF THE ADVANCEMENTS MADE INREHABILITATION ROBOTICS HAVE EITHER COME FROM OR HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO EXOSKELETONS AIMED AT HEALTHY USERS  EITHER FOR EXERCISE OR POWER AUGMENTATION. OVER 90% OF THE ESTIMATED 7 000 000 STROKE SURVIVORS (AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION  2012) WILL REQUIRE REHABILITATION FOCUSED ON REGAINING FUNCTION IN THE HAND AND WRIST IN ORDER TO REGAIN THE ABILITY TO PERFORM ACTS OF DAILY LIVING AND TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. TOWARDS THIS GOAL  ROBOTIC REHABILITATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED  PROVIDING A SAFE  ACCURATE WAY TO ADMINISTER THE HIGH INTENSITY  LONG DURATION PHYSICAL THERAPY REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL STROKE REHABILITATION. MUCH ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE REHABILITATION  EXERCISE  AND POWER AUGMENTATION OF THE LEGS  SHOULDERS  AND ELBOW. HOWEVER  INSUFFICIENT ATTENTIONHAS BEEN PAID TO THE HAND AND WRIST  AND THIS PROPOSAL WILL ADDRESS THIS SHORTCOMING. THE HAND AND WRIST TOGETHER HAVE 27 DEGREES OF FREEDOM  AND DUE TO PACKING AND SIZE CONSTRAINTS  ANY EXOSKELETON WILL LIKELY NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO ACTUATE AND MEASURE EVERY DEGREE OF FREEDOM. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE EXOSKELETON FROM BECOMING TOO BULKY AND HEAVY FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS  AND TO INSURE SAFE OPERATION  THE DESIGN WILL LIKELY BE A COMPLIANT AND UNDER-ACTUATED. I PROPOSE TO DEVELOP METHODS FOR CONTROLLING AN UNDER-ACTUATED  COMPLIANT HAND AND WRIST EXOSKELETON THAT WILL HAVE APPLICATIONS IN ROBOTIC REHABILITATION  RESISTIVE EXERCISE  AND POWER AUGMENTATION  BY COMBINING THE BENEFITS OF ADAPTIVE  ASSIST-AS-NEEDED CONTROL AND BREAKING DOWN COMPLEX MOTIONS. ASSIST-AS-NEEDED CONTROL IS A TECHNIQUE USED IN ROBOTIC REHABILITATION THAT ESTIMATES A PATIENT'S POWER OUTPUT CAPABILITIES  AND PROVIDES ASSISTANCE ONLY AS A COMPLEMENT TO THE MOTION  FACILITATING THE GAINS IN NEUROPLASTICITY  ESSENTIALLY THE REWIRING OF THE BRAIN  THAT OTHER TECHNIQUES CANNOT. THESE SAME ADAPTIVE CONTROL ALGORITHMS COULD BE USED SIMILARLY TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFICACY OF AN ASTRONAUT'S EXERCISE REGIMEN  OR TO ASSIST DURING AN EVA  EITHER BY HELPING AN ASTRONAUT HOLD ONTO A CERTAIN TOOL  OR PERFORM VARIOUS TASKS REQUIRING GREATER DEXTERITY OR POWER THAN THE ASTRONAUT ALONE CAN PROVIDE. I PROPOSE THAT THE BASIC HAND GRASP POSITIONS FOUND IN THE ROBOTIC MANIPULATOR LITERATURE COULD BE A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF UNDER-ACTUATION  AND COULD BE USED TO CREATE A SUBSET OF BUILDING BLOCKS UPON WHICH FUNCTIONAL TASKS ARE BUILT. THE BROKEN DOWN MOTIONS  IN ADDITION TO THEAFOREMENTIONED BENEFITS  HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE STROKE PATIENT OUTCOMES IN TRIALS DOWN ON THE SHOULDER AND ELBOW  BUT HAVE YET TO SEE IMPLEMENTATION ON THE HAND AND WRIST.FIRSTLY  THE REHABILITATION OF THE WRIST AND HAND WILL BE EXPLORING A CRUCIAL AND OVERLOOKED PART OF REHABILITATION ROBOTICS.

THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF AN MSR MISSION IS TO BRING SAMPLES TO EARTH  WHERE THEY CAN BE EXAMINED USING THE MOST SOPHISTICATED SCIENTIFIC METHODS. BECAUSE RETURNING SAMPLES IS DIFFICULT  PROPOSED MSR MISSION ARCHITECTURES BUDGET JUST 350 - 500 G FOR SPECIMENS. IN ORDER TO RECONCILE THE CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS OF SAMPLE DIVERSITY AND LIMITED PAYLOAD  THE MAKEUP OF COLLECTED MATERIALS SHOULD BE MEASURED BEFORE THEY ARE CACHED. DEPTH-PROFILED MEASUREMENTS OF THEBOREHOLE LEFT BY THE CORER OR DRILL AFTER THE SAMPLE IS EXTRACTED WILL YIELD INSIGHT ABOUT A SAMPLE'S STRATA  WHICH CAN BE USED TO CONFIRM OR REJECT ITS SUITABILITY. THE LIBS BOROSCOPE DESCRIBED HERE CAN PERFORM SUCH MEASUREMENTS  WHICH WILL YIELD GEOCHEMICAL CONTEXT FORSPECIMENS WHILE ALSO ENABLING SCIENTISTS TO EVALUATE PHYSIOCHEMICAL CHANGES THAT MIGHT OCCUR DURING CACHE OR RETURN. LIBS WORKS BY IRRADIATING A SAMPLE  IN THIS CASE THE BOREHOLE WALL  WITH A PULSED LASER TO INDUCE PLASMA IGNITION AND ABLATION. THE CONTINUUM AND LINE SPECTRA FROM THE PLASMA SPARK ARE USED TO IDENTIFY ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION AND  USING STANDARD SPECTROSCOPIC PRACTICES  CONSTRAIN THE MOLECULAR MAKEUP.

THE PRESENT STUDY WILL FOCUS ON TWO MAIN OBJECTIVES: IMPROVING THE PULSE-TO-PULSE REPEATABILITY OF LIBS MEASUREMENTS AND DEVELOPING A SELF-CONTAINED PROTOTYPE LIBS BOROSCOPE INSTRUMENT FOR TECHNOLOGY-READINESS-LEVEL MATURATION. WITH CONVENTIONAL LIBS INSTRUMENTS  DETECTION LIMITS ARE TYPICALLY AT THE PPM OR PPB LEVEL  BUT THE PULSE-TO-PULSE VARIANCE IS TYPICALLY ON THE ORDER OF 5 - 20 PERCENT. TO IMPROVE THIS  PHASE I OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTING DOUBLE-PULSE EXCITATION  TIME-RESOLVED LINE-RATIO MEASUREMENTS  AS WELL AS MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT AND HELIUM DOUSING. BETWEEN THESE TECHNIQUES  THIS STUDY SEEKS TO REDUCE PULSE-TOPULSE VARIANCE BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. FINITE ELEMENT MODELING OF SPARK PLASMA EVOLUTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ALONGSIDE BREADBOARD EXPERIMENTS TO QUANTIFY IMPROVEMENTS. THE OPTIMAL INTER-PULSE DELAY  LASER FLUENCE RATIO  HELIUM DOUSE RATE  MAGNETIC FIELD ENERGY RATIO  AND OTHER RESULTS FROM THE PHASE I STUDY WILL BE USED TO INFORM DESIGN OF THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT DURING PHASE II. SYSTEM ENGINEERING OF THE PROTOTYPE WILL BE ANCHORED BY EXISTING OR PROJECTED SPACE TECHNOLOGIES WITH RESPECT TO THE DOUBLE-PULSE LASER SPECTROMETER  AND ROBOTIC MECHANISM CONTROLLING THE OPTICAL PROBE. THE ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES OF THE LIBS BOROSCOPE INVESTIGATION INCLUDE IMPROVED REPEATABILITY FOR LIBS INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED FOR SPACE AND A PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR THIS NEW MEASUREMENT APPROACH.

THERE IS A DIRECT NEED FOR A SINGLE  AUTOMATED DESIGN AND FABRICATION PROCESS. FURTHERMORE  NEW FABRICATION TECHNIQUES AT THE MICRO AND MACRO SCALES PROVIDE NEARLY UNLIMITED DESIGN AND PRODUCT POTENTIAL  FOR WHICH THERE IS NO DESIGN PRECEDENT. EMPIRICAL DESIGN WILL NOT TRANSFER TO THE PROJECTS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF BEING PRODUCED WITH THESE TECHNIQUES (OR EXAMPLE  MOBILE SOFT ROBOTS)  BECAUSE HUMAN INTUITION WILL FAIL WHEN TRYING TO PREDICT THE PERFORMANCE OF NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NOVEL MATERIALS AND FORMS AT MULTIPLE SCALES. I PROPOSE THAT EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS(EAS) ARE USED TO ITERATIVELY AND INTERACTIVELY PRODUCE DESIGNS. EAS MIMIC THE TRAITS OF BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION AND APPLY THEM TO ARTIFICIAL DESIGN OF NOVEL AND UNINTUITIVE SOLUTIONS. THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CREATE COMPLEX AND INTERESTING FORMS WITH INTERACTIVE FEEDBACK FROM A HUMAN USER  AND ALSO HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CREATE HIGH PERFORMING SOLUTIONS WHEN LEFT TO OPTIMIZE PRODUCT DESIGN TOWARDS ONE OR MORE OBJECTIVE FEATURE. EXAMPLES OF EA PERFORMANCE INCLUDE A PART DEPLOYED ON THE NASA ST5 SPACECRAFT WHICH OUTPERFORMED ALL OF THE ALTERNATIVE HUMAN DESIGNED SOLUTIONS OR SPECIALIZED CRUMPLE ZONES IN INDUSTRY LEADING AUTOMOBILES. THE UNIVERSAL DESIGNTOOL I PROPOSE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF COMPUTATIONAL PRECISION AND SPEED TO CREATE AN ARRAY OF HIGH PERFORMING DESIGNS  THEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A USER'S HUMAN INTUITION TO JUDGE AND SELECT DESIGNS ACCORDING TO INTUITIVE PROPERTIES THAT THE COMPUTER CANNOT COMPUTE ON ITS OWN (E.G. DESIGNS THAT ARE NOVEL  INTERESTING  ATTRACTIVE  OR PROMISING). THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT PRESSURES ARE SHAPING THE DESIGN FROM DIFFERENT SYSTEMS (THE USER'S PREFERENCES AND THE COMPUTER'S PERFORMANCE METRIC) WILL OVERCOME MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WITH LOCAL OPTIMA AND LACK OF DIVERSITY THAT EAS HAVE FACED IN THE PAST. ADDITIONALLY  RECENT WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THE USE OF DRIVERS SUCH AS INTERESTINGNESS OR NOVELTY CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE DRIVERS OF EAS THAN A DIRECT PERFORMANCE METRIC. THE ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS OF AN EA MEANS THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A FUNCTIONALLY VIABLE  FULLY DESCRIBED  DESIGN THAT IS BEING OPTIMIZED. THUS AT ANY POINT IN TIME  THE BEST CURRENT DESIGN CAN BE SENT TO A 3D PRINTER FOR IMMEDIATE FABRICATION. THIS DESIGN TOOL WOULD CONTAIN PROPERTIES SUCH AS: IMMEDIATE AND INDIVIDUALIZED FABRICATION POTENTIAL OF CURRENT DESIGNS; LACK OF NEED FOR DOMAIN SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OR FOR FULL INTUITION OF THE (USUALLY NON-LINEAR) CONSTRAINTS AND PROCESSES OCCURRING (AND BEING OPTIMIZED) AT MULTIPLE SCALES; AND THE SOLE REQUIREMENTS OF A HIGH LEVEL PERFORMANCE METRIC AND GENERAL HUMAN INTUITION. THESE MAKE THIS SYSTEM IDEAL FOR DESIGN OPTIMIZATION AT ANY SCALE-WHETHER IT BE AS LARGE AND RIGOROUS AS A NASA SPACECRAFT OR AS QUICK AND SIMPLE AS A CLEANING ROBOT AT HOME OR A LOAD BEARING FRAME AT AN INDUSTRIAL JOB SITE.

A USB?DROP EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED AT UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA?CHAMPAIGN ([TISCHER 2016] [TISCHER 2017]) WHERE USB DRIVES WERE DISTRIBUTED ON A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS WHICH CONTAINED FILES THAT CONNECTED TO AN EXTERNAL WEBSITE RUN BY THE RESEARCHERS TO COLLECT DATA. BY CONNECTING TO THE WEBSITE  INFORMATION ABOUT THE BROWSER AND HARDWARE OF THE INDIVIDUAL WAS AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED. THE WEBSITE ALSO DIRECTED THE PERSON WHO OPENED THE FILE TO A VOLUNTARY SURVEY FOR MORE PERSONAL INFORMATION. THEIR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE ON A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS WILL NOT ONLY PLUG IN FOREIGN USB DRIVES  BUT THEY WILL ALSO ACTUALLY OPEN FILES ON THEM AT A HIGH RATE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PHISHING TRAINING IS A HEAVILY STUDIED TOPIC. THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT EXAMINE TRAINING TO COUNTERACT PHISHING ([MAYHORN 2010]  [SIADATII 2017]  [KUMARAGURU 2010]).

FOUR KEY PROJECTS WILL BE PROPOSED.    EXPLORATION SCIENCE  NESS WILL MATURE A CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY OF SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION MISSIONS FROM THE ORBITS OF TARGET BODIES:  SURFACE TELEROBOTICS.  WE WILL DEVELOP HUMAN-ROBOTIC SCIENCE ASSOCIATED WITH ORION/HABITAT MISSIONS IN CIS-LUNAR ORBITS.  OUR TEAM WILL BUILD TOOLS FOR THE CREW TO TELEOPERATE ROVERS ON THE LUNAR FARSIDE THAT WILL FEED-FORWARD TO THE FIRST CREWED MARS MISSIONS.  WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE SYSTEMS NEEDED ON ORION/HABITAT TO SUPPORT TELEROBOTICS  ANALYZE LUNAR LOW FREQUENCY RADIO TELESCOPE DEPLOYMENT ALONG WITH A LUNAR SAMPLE RETURN  AND DEVELOP CREW TRAINING STRATEGIES.  LLR  CURRENT ALTERNATE THEORIES OF GRAVITY PREDICT DEVIATIONS FROM GENERAL RELATIVITY  GR  AT A LEVEL THAT IS WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF LUNAR LASER RANGING  LLR  INSTRUMENTS.  NESS WILL IMPROVE BY FACTORS GREATER THAN 100 THE SIGNAL PHOTOELECTRON ACCURACY OF LLR TO SET NEW CONSTRAINTS ON GR AND THE LUNAR CORE.  WE WILL ALSO MEASURE/MODEL DUST ON LLR OPTICAL SURFACES AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SELENODETIC COORDINATE SYSTEM FOR EXPLORATION AND SCIENCE MISSIONS.  HELIOPHYSICS AND SPACE PHYSICS_NESS HELIOPHYSICS RESEARCH DIRECTLY IMPACTS HUMAN EXPLORATION VIA OUR STUDIES OF SOLAR PARTICLE RADIATION AND INTERPLANETARY DUST.  WE WILL ADVANCE THE DESIGN FOR A LUNAR-BASED LOW FREQUENCY  LESS THAN 10 MHZ  RADIO IMAGER  UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF IMAGING THE TRAJECTORY OF PARTICLE ACCELERATION IN SOLAR ERUPTIONS  AND MEASURING INTERPLANETARY NANODUST.  FROM COSMIC DAWN TO HABITABLE PLANETS  NESS ADDRESSES KEY QUESTIONS FROM THE ASTROPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY: \"WHEN AND HOW DID THE FIRST GALAXIES FORM?\" AND \"CAN WE FIND ANOTHER PLANET LIKE EARTH ORBITING A NEARBY STAR?\" OUR TEAM WILL USE NEW MODELING TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO INVESTIGATE THE FORMATION OF THE FIRST GALAXIES USING THE NEUTRAL HYDROGEN 21-CM SIGNAL  RED-SHIFTED TO 2-3 M.  THE MOON'S FARSIDE IS UNIQUELY SHIELDED FROM RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE AND FREE FROM IONOSPHERIC EFFECTS TO ENABLE SUCH OBSERVATIONS.  A FARSIDE OBSERVATORY IS IMPORTANT FOR EXPLORATION TO INVESTIGATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES TO DEPLOYING/OPERATING A LARGE-AREA SCIENTIFIC STATION ON THE MOON.  WE WILL ADVANCE 21-CM COSMOLOGY THEORY  THE DESIGN OF A LOW RADIO FREQUENCY ARRAY  WIDE-BAND RECEIVERS  AND NEW CALIBRATION TECHNIQUES.  NESS ALSO WILL ADVANCE THE STUDY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HABITABLE EXOPLANETS BY EMPLOYING POLARIMETRY ON LARGE UV_OPTICAL TELESCOPES CONSTRUCTED IN CIS-LUNAR SPACE  AND BY USING A FARSIDE RADIO ARRAY TO DETECT MAGNETOSPHERES FOR EARTH-LIKE PLANETS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7d586cfa-95f6-0e31-3589-fbd59b788eda-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80ARC017M0006_8000"}]
