SUSTAINED INCREASES IN METABOLIC RATE CAN LEAD TO DEPLETION OF ENERGETIC RESERVES REQUIRED FOR AEROBIC RESPIRATION THAT ULTIMATELY IMPEDE AN ORGANISMS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THERMAL STRESS. THUS, THERMAL TOLERANCE IS CLOSELY LINKED TO AN ORGANISMS CAPACITY TO MAINTAIN A HIGHER AEROBIC METABOLIC RATE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE CHANGES IN METABOLIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN RESPONSE TO CHRONIC THERMAL STRESS IN AN EFFORT TO ADVANCE OUR SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN ORGANISMS METABOLIC CAPACITY AND THEIR THERMAL TOLERANCE LIMITS. IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL USE THE FATHEAD MINNOW (PIMEPHALES PROMELAS) AS A MODEL SPECIES TO DETERMINE HOW VARIATION IN METABOLIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTE TO DIFFERENCES IN THERMAL TOLERANCE BY COMPARING TWO DISTINCT POPULATIONS THAT ORIGINATE FROM TEMPERATE LATITUDINAL.

HOWEVER, FOR CARBON MANAGEMENT TO MATTER IN MITIGATING CLIMATIC CHANGE, THE CARBON MUST STAY SEQUESTERED FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIODS OF TIME AND MUST OCCUR ACROSS A LARGE SPATIAL SCALE. FURTHER, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WIDESPREAD PUBLIC LAND USES, SUCH AS GRAZING, AFFECT CARBON REMAINS EXCEEDINGLY POOR, AS DOES OUR COMPREHENSION OF THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCED MANAGEMENT TO PROTECT OR INCREASE CARBON POOLS. ACCORDINGLY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANAGEMENT PLANS THAT INTEGRATE CARBON MANAGEMENT WITH EXISTING LAND MANAGEMENT GOALS OFFERS AN EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT OUR NATION IN MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENHANCING LOCAL CO-BENEFITS. THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE NOVEL, ACTIONABLE SCIENCE TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS ONGOING MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS RELATED TO CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN THE WEST THAT WILL BE OF IMMEDIATE USE TO LAND MANAGERS. SPECIFICALLY, THIS WORK WILL ADDRESS THREE OVERARCHING QUESTIONS: (Q1) WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CARBON SEQUESTRATION POTENTIAL IN RANGELANDS ACROSS A DIVERSITY OF DRYLAND ECOSYSTEMS  (Q2) HOW DOES GRAZING INTERACT WITH CLIMATE AND SOIL TYPE TO REGULATE CARBON STORAGE  (Q3) COULD GRAZING PRACTICES BE REFINED IN THE FACE OF GLOBAL CHANGE TO OPTIMIZE SOIL CARBON STORAGE BOTH ABOVE AND BELOWGROUND  TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS, WE WILL (OBJECTIVE 1) SYNTHESIZE DATA FROM THE PUBLISHED AND GREY LITERATURE TO INFORM HOW GRAZING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN DRYLAND ECOSYSTEMS AFFECT CARBON STORAGE AND (OBJECTIVE 2) ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CARBON STORAGE, GRAZING INTENSITY, AND SOIL TYPE ACROSS A SOIL AND CLIMATIC GRADIENT IN UTAH BY JOINING ON-THE-GROUND ASSESSMENT, REMOTE SENSING DATA, AND BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (BLM) ASSESSMENT, INVENTORY, AND MONITORING (AIM) DATA. FINALLY, WE WILL SHARE THE NEW KNOWLEDGE AND TOOLS CREATED THROUGH THE DIVERSE COLLABORATIONS AND OUTREACH STRATEGIES DEVELOPED BY OUR TEAM TO ENSURE THE UTILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF OUR RESULTS. COLLABORATORS, PARTNERS, AND STAKEHOLDERS WILL BE ENGAGED THROUGHOUT THIS PROJECT THROUGH IN PERSON AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS, FIELD VISITS AND THE CO-CREATION OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PAPERS, INFORMATIONAL 2-PAGERS, AND REPORTS. THE VAST PUBLIC LANDS OF THE WESTERN U.S. HAVE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL TO HELP US PROTECT AND RESTORE CARBON IN STABLE POOLS, AND THE GOAL IS TO SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CARBON CYCLING ON THESE LANDS AND TO WORK ALONGSIDE THE MANAGER PARTNERS TO DEVELOP METHODS FOR INFORMED CARBON MANAGEMENT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d345a8ea-b0ac-7e5d-b949-6507917f2140-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_G23AC00417_1434"}, {"internal_id": 160833339, "Award ID": "G23AC00414", "Award Amount": 201178.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-07-12", "CFDA Number": "15.808", "Description": "PROJECT PERIOD: 7 1 23-6 30 24PROJECT TITLE: ENGAGING POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN ADVANCED, NATIONAL-SCALE SYNTHESIS COLLABORATIONSWATER IS CENTRAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF ECOSYSTEMS, HUMAN COMMUNITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS, AND IN EXTREMES (FLOODS, DROUGHTS) CAN LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC OUTCOMES.

CONTINENTAL U.S. IS ONE OF THE MAJOR TIDAL WETLAND COUNTRIES WITH AN ESTIMATION OF 26,818 KM2. GIVEN THAT APPROXIMATELY 29  OF THE U.S. POPULATION LIVES IN COASTAL REGIONS, TIDAL WETLANDS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE ECOSYSTEMS, THREATENED BY INTENSE HUMAN ACTIVITIES (E.G., HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, ALTERED HYDROLOGY). KNOWING WHERE AND WHEN THE CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED WITH DIRECT HUMAN ACTIVITIES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE COASTAL TIDAL WETLAND WITH ALTERATION OF THE HYDROLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, IS IMPORTANT FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.HERE, PROPOSE TO UTILIZE SPATIALLY EXTENSIVE REMOTE SENSING DATASETS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON COASTAL TIDAL WETLANDS AND QUANTIFY THE RELEVANT DRIVERS.

MUCH OF OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF MIGRATORY BIRD ECOLOGY AND SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT IS BASED ON CAPTURING AND RELEASING BANDED BIRDS. RECOVERY OR RE-SIGHTING OF BANDED BIRDS PROVIDES DATA FOR INVESTIGATING SURVIVAL, CAUSES OF MORTALITY, PRODUCTIVITY, AND MIGRATION PATTERNS. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF DATA COLLECTED PER MARKED BIRD IS OFTEN LOW DUE TO LOW ENCOUNTER RATES.  RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN WILDLIFE MARKING TECHNOLOGY, OFFER NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT BASED ON MARKED BIRDS. THE MOTUS TRACKING TECHNOLOGY IS ONE SUCH TECHNOLOGY. WILL WORK WITH MANAGEMENT AGENCIES AND ASSOCIATED STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP CONTINUOUS-TIME AND CONTINUOUS-SPACE CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELS SUITABLE FOR USE WITH DATA COLLECTED ON THE MOTUS NETWORK. WILL ALSO USE SIMULATION-BASED STUDIES TO QUANTIFY STATISTICAL POWER AND OTHER SAMPLING OR DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS (E.G., NUMBER AND PLACEMENT OF TOWERS) TO IMPROVE INFERENCE FROM MOTUS DATA.  PREVIOUSLY, OUR RESEARCH GROUP DEMONSTRATED HOW CONTINUOUS-TIME APPROACHES COULD BE EXTENDED TO MOTUS DETECTIONS FROM RELATIVELY SIMPLE MOVEMENT SCENARIOS (SINGLE POPULATION MODELING BETWEEN DISTINCT WINTERING AND BREEDING SITES). FOR THIS PROJECT. WILL EXTEND THIS APPROACH TO INCLUDE MORE COMPLEX MOVEMENT SCENARIOS COMMON IN WATERFOWL POPULATIONS (MULTIPLE BREEDING OR NON-BREEDING POPULATIONS) AND WILL EXPLORE THE USE OF BOTH DISCRETE SPACE AND CONTINUOUS SPACE APPROACHES TO THESE SCENARIOS. TO INCORPORATE CONTINUOUS SPACE INTO THE ANALYSIS OF MOTUS DATA, WILL DEVELOP SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT MOVEMENT MODELS THAT TREAT DETECTIONS OF TAGGED BIRDS AS STEMMING FROM A LATENT MOVEMENT PATH (I.E., STATE PROCESS) AND THE PLACEMENT AND OPERATION OF MOTUS RECEIVERS (I.E., OBSERVATION PROCESS). WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE SAMPLING DESIGN TO IMPROVE MOTUS-BASED MONITORING OF PRIORITY BIRD SPECIES. WILL SIMULATE MOVEMENT TRACKS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS AND THE OVERLAY ALTERNATIVE RECEIVER DESIGNS TO GENERATE SAMPLING DATA.

THESE MONITORING EFFORTS RELY ON MAPS DERIVED FROM SATELLITE IMAGERY. TO ASSESS MAP ACCURACY, A SAMPLE OF PIXELS (I.E., MAP UNITS) IS SELECTED, WHERE A SAMPLE IS A PORTION OF THE AREA MAPPED. THE REFERENCE CONDITION OF EACH SAMPLE PIXEL IS DETERMINED BY HUMAN INTERPRETERS EXAMINING SATELLITE IMAGERY AND OTHER DETAILED SPATIAL INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH EACH PIXEL. THIS REFERENCE CONDITION IS THEN COMPARED TO THE MAP INFORMATION TO DETERMINE ACCURACY. ANOTHER USE OF REFERENCE SAMPLE DATA IS TO ESTIMATE AREA OF LAND COVER AND LAND COVER CHANGE. THESE SAMPLE-BASED ESTIMATES ARE CONSIDERED GOOD PRACTICE BECAUSE THEY ARE BASED ON THE INTENSIVELY INTERPRETED REFERENCE CONDITION OF EACH PIXEL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP ADVANCED STATISTICAL METHODS THAT WILL MAKE COLLECTION OF REFERENCE SAMPLE DATA MORE COST EFFICIENT AND USE OF DATA MORE EFFECTIVE FOR ASSESSING ACCURACY OF LAND COVER MAPS AND ESTIMATING AREA OF LAND COVER CHANGE. STATISTICAL METHODS ARE NEEDED TO QUANTIFY UNCERTAINTY OF ESTIMATES PRODUCED FROM THE REFERENCE SAMPLE DATA. THIS UNCERTAINTY IS TYPICALLY REPRESENTED BY THE STANDARD ERROR OF AN ESTIMATE. TWO FEATURES OF STANDARD ERRORS WILL BE ADDRESSED: 1) IMPLEMENTING PROTOCOLS THAT RESULT IN SMALL STANDARD ERRORS  AND 2) DEVELOPING METHODS THAT ENHANCE ESTIMATION OF STANDARD ERRORS. THE RESEARCH FOCUSING ON THE FIRST FEATURE ENTAILS IMPROVING THE SAMPLING DESIGN USED TO COLLECT THE REFERENCE DATA. TYPICALLY, STRATIFIED SAMPLING IS IMPLEMENTED. A FIRST STEP TO IMPROVE STRATIFICATION IS TO UNDERSTAND TRADE-OFFS IN PRECISION OF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES RESULTING FROM CHOICE OF STRATA AND SAMPLE SIZE ALLOCATION TO STRATA. FOR EXAMPLE, A SAMPLE SIZE ALLOCATION THAT REDUCES STANDARD ERRORS OF ACCURACY ESTIMATES WILL LIKELY NOT BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO STANDARD ERRORS OF AREA ESTIMATES, SO COMPROMISE SOLUTIONS MUST BE IDENTIFIED THAT ACCOMMODATE MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES. ANOTHER RESEARCH TOPIC IS INVESTIGATING METHODS THAT INCORPORATE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT THE SAMPLING TO TARGET NEW OBJECTIVES AS MONITORING PROCEEDS OVER TIME. THIS ADAPTABILITY WOULD BE ACHIEVED BY RE-DEFINING THE STRATA AND INTENSIFYING AN AUGMENTED SAMPLE IN THOSE STRATA. IN ADDITION TO UNCERTAINTY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SAMPLING VARIABILITY, INCONSISTENCY AMONG HUMAN INTERPRETERS DETERMINING THE REFERENCE CONDITION CONTRIBUTES ANOTHER SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY TO SAMPLE-BASED AREA ESTIMATES. TWO ASPECTS OF INTERPRETER VARIABILITY WILL BE STUDIED. FIRST, THE MAGNITUDE OF THE VARIANCE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERPRETERS WILL BE QUANTIFIED. TWO METHODS FOR ESTIMATING THIS VARIANCE WILL BE EXPLORED, ONE BASED ON A MEASUREMENT ERROR MODEL, THE OTHER USING A METHOD CALLED INTERPENETRATING SUBSAMPLING. THE FORMER METHOD REQUIRES A SECOND INTERPRETER TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION OF REFERENCE CONDITION, WHEREAS THE LATTER METHOD REQUIRES A CONSTRAINED RANDOMIZATION OF INTERPRETERS TO THE SAMPLE PIXELS BUT NOT REPEAT INTERPRETATIONS. THESE ESTIMATES WILL DEMONSTRATE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNCERTAINTY OF SAMPLING VARIABILITY VERSUS INTERPRETER VARIABILITY AS WELL AS IDENTIFY OPTIONS FOR REDUCING THESE CONTRIBUTIONS TO VARIANCE.THE DELIVERABLES FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL BE STATISTICALLY RIGOROUS YET PRACTICAL METHODS FOR ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SAMPLING TO COLLECT REFERENCE DATA. IMPROVEMENTS IN SAMPLING DESIGN WILL YIELD INFORMATION AT LOWER COST, AND ADVANCES IN ESTIMATION OF UNCERTAINTY WILL LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE DATA.

WILL FOCUS ON CHLORINATED SOLVENTS, POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBS), AND PER  AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFAS) AND EVALUATE IF MICROORGANISMS PRESENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BIODEGRADE THESE CONTAMINANTS. THESE COMPOUNDS SHARE THE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC THAT THEY ARE TOXIC AND ARE DIFFICULT TO BREAK DOWN. CHLORINATED SOLVENTS ARE AMONG THE MOST FREQUENTLY FOUND CONTAMINANTS IN GROUNDWATER, PCBS ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH SEDIMENT AND PARTICLE BASED CONTAMINATION IN STORMWATER AND PFAS ARE OFTEN FOUND TOGETHER WITH OTHER CONTAMINANTS IN WATER AND SEDIMENT. PFAS HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED MUCH MORE ATTENTION AND HAVE BEEN TERMED  FOREVER CHEMICALS  SINCE THEY ARE HARD TO DEGRADE. WILL ALSO ASSESS CONTAMINANTS PRESENT IN STORMWATER RUNOFF, SINCE MAJOR (RE) CONTAMINATION CAN TAKE PLACE NEAR STORMWATER DISCHARGE POINTS.

THE FOCUS WILL BE ON SEDIMENT TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN JAMAICA BAY WHETHER THE WETLANDS THERE THAT CAN HELP TO MITIGATE IMPACTS OF COASTAL STORMS. A PRIMARY AIM IS TO CHARACTERIZE HOW SEDIMENT TRANSPORT IN JAMAICA BAY AND SEDIMENT DELIVERY TO THE MARSH DEPENDS ON WIND AND WAVE FORCING CONDITIONS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE WILL USE STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELING TOOLS WITH REALISTIC FORCING CONDITIONS. WE AIM TO QUANTIFY SEDIMENT TRANSPORT THROUGH ROCKAWAY INLET TO ASSESS VARIABILITY IN THE SEDIMENT SUPPLY TO THE BAY UNDER DIFFERENT STORM AND NON-STORM FORCING CONDITIONS.

CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO OVERABUNDANT HORSE POPULATIONS ON FEDERALLY-MANAGED LAND, YET RECENT DATA INDICATES THAT OVERABUNDANT FERAL HORSES MAY BE A LARGER ISSUE ON TRIBAL LANDS.  FERAL HORSE GRAZING CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT WESTERN RANGELANDS IN SEVERAL WAYS INCLUDING DECREASED NATIVE PLANT COVER, SHORTER GRASS HEIGHT, INCREASED SOIL COMPACTION, MORE INVASIVE SPECIES, AND INCREASED PROPORTIONS OF BARE GROUND. HORSE-INDUCED HABITAT ALTERATION IS A THREAT TO BOTH LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE. OVERABUNDANT HORSE POPULATIONS THREATEN THE CAPACITY OF WESTERN RANGELANDS TO PROVISION ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, AND THIS ISSUE IS LIKELY MOST ACUTE ON TRIBAL LANDS. TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LARGELY UNDERFUNDED AND THE FUNDING OF NATURAL RESOURCE DEPARTMENTS COME IN FAR BEHIND HUMAN HEALTH CONCERNS. IN FACT, MANY TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TASK PEOPLE WITHOUT FORMAL NATURAL RESOURCE EDUCATIONS TO SERVE MULTIPLE ROLES.

THUS, UNDERSTANDING THE INFLUENCE OF FUNCTIONAL TRAITS COULD LEAD TO MORE TARGETED MANAGEMENT OF ECOSYSTEMS WITH THE GREATEST SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INVASIVE SPECIES IMPACTS.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THE MACROECOLOGICAL SYNTHESIS WILL LEVERAGE A RECENT DATA COMPILATION TO ASK: 1) DO INVASIVE SPECIES DISPROPORTIONATELY REDUCE THE ABUNDANCE OF COMMON AND FUNCTIONALLY SIMILAR NATIVE SPECIES?; 2) HOW DO INVASIONS SHIFT TRAIT DISTRIBUTIONS WITHIN COMMUNITIES?; AND 3) HOW DO INVASIONS UNDERLIE BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION OF SPECIES COMPOSITION, FUNCTIONAL TRAITS, AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY? THE DATA ARE DERIVED FROM APPROXIMATELY 50,000 PLOTS ACROSS NATURAL AREAS OF THE U.S., WITH AN EMPHASIS ON FEDERALLY MANAGED LANDS. BY INCREASING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLES OF ABUNDANCE AND FUNCTIONAL TRAITS IN INVASIONS, WORK WILL ADVANCE ECOLOGICAL THEORY AND INFORM MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES: WILL SYNTHESIZE THE IMPACTS OF PLANT INVASIONS TO PROVIDE THE FIRST MACROECOLOGICAL TESTS OF HOW RARITY AND TRAIT DISSIMILARITY ALTER NATIVE SPECIES RESPONSES TO INVASION. THIS WORK WILL LEVERAGE ECOLOGICAL THEORY TO EXPLAIN VARIABILITY IN INVADER IMPACTS, AND WILL PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR MANAGEMENT BASED ON SPECIES' FUNCTIONAL TRAITS. THE EMPIRICAL SYNTHESIS DRAWS ON THE LARGEST COMPILATION OF COMPLETE-COMMUNITY DATA REPRESENTING THE ABUNDANCE AND IMPACTS OF NORTH AMERICAN INVASIVE PLANTS. THIS FULL-COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE ENABLES LINKAGES TO ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES VIA THE FUNCTIONAL TRAITS THAT PREDOMINATE WITHIN A COMMUNITY. THE WORK WILL QUANTIFY HOW SHIFTS IN OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT COMMON AND DISSIMILAR SPECIES, AND THEREBY ALTER THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNCTIONAL TRAITS. TO DATE, THE UNDERSTANDING OF SCALE DEPENDENCE IN INVASION ECOLOGY HAS FOCUSED ON SPECIES RICHNESS, AND THE WORK WILL PRODUCE THE FIRST ANALYSIS OF HOW SPECIES TRAIT DISTRIBUTIONS CAN BE ALTERED BY INVASION FROM PLOT TO ECOREGIONAL SCALES.INTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES): THE WORK WILL SYNTHESIZE UNDERUTILIZED DATA COLLECTED BY FEDERAL LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES TO INFORM THE MANAGEMENT OF PLANT INVASIONS IN NATURAL AREAS. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED ON FEDERAL AND PRIVATE LANDS, AND REPRESENT SYSTEMS THAT ARE LESS DISTURBED THAN MOST LANDSCAPES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.

ESTIMATING ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTION ACROSS GRADIENTS OF RIVER ALTERATION IN THE COLORADO RIVER BASINPROJECT PERIOD: 04/15/2022 - 04/14/2027AWARD PURPOSE: THE COLORADO RIVER BASIN (CRB) IS ONE OF THE MOST OVERALLOCATED RIVER NETWORKS IN THE WORLD AND IS EXPERIENCING DECLINING WATERSHED RUNOFF DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. MOST FISH SPECIES NATIVE TO THE CRB ARE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE AND HAVE DECLINED DRAMATICALLY COINCIDENT WITH THE DAMMING AND REGULATION OF THE CRB. SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES ARE INVESTED TO RECOVER THESE FISH SPECIES WITH EFFORTS LARGELY FOCUSED ON RESTORING PHYSICAL CONDITIONS (I.E., HABITAT, FLOW OR WATER TEMPERATURE) AND REMOVING NON-NATIVE FISH SPECIES. THERE HAS BEEN MINIMAL FOCUS ON QUANTIFYING CHANGES TO THE PRIMARY (I.E., PLANTS) AND SECONDARY PRODUCTION (E.G., INSECTS) THAT FUEL NATIVE FISH SPECIES. BASED ON RESEARCH IN OTHER RIVERS, EXPECT PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PRODUCTION (HEREAFTER RIVER PRODUCTIVITY) IN THE CRB IS IMPACTED BY RIVER REGULATION, MODIFIED HYDROLOGY, AND AGRICULTURAL AND MUNICIPAL RUNOFF, WITH CLIMATE CHANGE LIKELY TO BRING FURTHER MODIFICATIONS. IF RIVER PRODUCTIVITY IS LIMITING FISH SPECIES, THEN INCREASING WATER TEMPERATURES AND DECLINING RUNOFF ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE MAY EXACERBATE THIS LIMITATION.
