THIS PROJECT WILL IMPLEMENT AUTOMATED QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS ON BOTH EXISTING AND FUTURE WATER USE DATA ENTRIES. IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING EXISTING DATA, THE WISCONSIN DNR WILL IMPLEMENT QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS UPON DATA AS IT IS ENTERED INTO THE STATE S DATABASE EVERY YEAR.DURING THIS PROJECT, THE WISCONSIN DNR WILL REQUIRE MODIFICATION OF EXISTING DATABASE TABLES AND SCHEMA. THESE MODIFICATIONS WILL IMPROVE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE EXISTING DATABASE BY ADDING HISTORICAL WATER USE REPORTS MADE PRIOR TO 2010 TO THE DATABASE, AS WELL AS ASSOCIATING OLDER HIGH-CAPACITY WELLS WITH WELL CONSTRUCTION REPORTS, WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE IDENTIFICATION OF GEOLOGY AND AQUIFERS BEING UTILIZED FOR GROUNDWATER WITHDRAWALS.
