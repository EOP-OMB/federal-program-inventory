HERE  WE PROPOSE A NOVEL LINEAR ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY (AG) TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO COUNTERACT THESE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON THE ASTRONAUTS. PREVIOUS  CENTRIFUGE  AG SYSTEMS HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS DUE TO THE CONSTANT ROTATING ENVIRONMENT: 1) CORIOLIS FORCES  WHICH MAY BE CONFUSING AND LIMIT CONCURRENT EXERCISE OR LEAD TO INJURY  2) VESTIBULAR CROSSCOUPLING ILLUSIONS  WHICH ARE HIGHLY PROVOCATIVE AND CAUSE MOTION SICKNESS  AND 3) GRAVITY GRADIENTS  WHERE THE LOADING VARYING ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE ASTRONAUTS BODY.

THE ADVANTAGES OF OUR PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OVER CURRENT APPROACHES  SUCH AS WASHING OUT PERCHLORATE TO CLEANSE SOIL OR USING HYDROPONICS TO GROW PLANTS  INCLUDE A LOW INITIALIZATION MASS OF MICROBIAL CELLS  ON-DEMAND CELL GROWTH WITH IN SITU RESOURCES  AND THE ELIMINATION OF TOXIC WASTEWATER. TO ACCOMPLISH OUR PROPOSED CONCEPT ARCHITECTURE  WE WILL INVESTIGATE TWO STRAINS OF A DIVERSE CLADE OF ORGANISMS  PSEUDOMONAS  WHICH INCLUDES RELEVANT EXTREMOPHILES. PSEUDOMONAS STUTZERI PDA IS A PERCHLORATE REDUCER THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY STUDIED USING A METHOD THAT EXAMINES THE FITNESS PROFILES OF ORGANISM MUTANTS IN SEVERAL ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS TO OBTAIN GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF FITNESS. PSEUDOMONAS STUTZERI IS ALSO CAPABLE OF NITROGEN FIXATION (E.G.  STRAIN A1501). PSEUDOMONAS HAS TWO ADVANTAGES THAT MAKE EXPERIMENTS WITH IT MORE PRACTICAL THAN WITH OTHER SPACE SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY POSSIBILITIES LIKE PHOTOSYNTHETIC  EXTREMOPHILE CYANOBACTERIA: THE USE OF THE SAME HOST CLONING VECTORS AS THE MODEL LABORATORY ORGANISM ESCHERICHIA COLI  AND A DOUBLING TIME OF AN HOUR  WHICH IS MUCH FASTER THAN SEVEN HOURS FOR A MODEL NON-EXTREMOPHILE CYANOBACTERIUM AND FOUR DAYS FOR A MODEL EXTREMOPHILE CYANOBACTERIUM.

FIRST  NEOS ARE AN IMPACT HAZARD TO THE EARTH AND CONGRESS HAS MANDATED THAT NASA FIND 90 PERCENT OF ALL THE OBJECTS OVER 140 METERS BY THE END OF 2020. NASA WILL FAIL TO MEET THIS MANDATE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF CURRENT ASTEROID SURVEY APPROACHES. SECOND  MEASURING THE NEO POPULATION DISTRIBUTIONS IN SPACE WILL UNLOCK THE ANSWERS TO CRITICAL QUESTIONS DEALING WITH THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. FINALLY  NEOS ARE EXCITING CANDIDATES AS TARGETS FOR HUMAN EXPLORATION AND THEY REPRESENT A VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED RESOURCE OF VALUABLE MATERIAL FOR RADIATION SHIELDING  PROPELLANT  AND LIFE SUPPORT CONSUMABLES THAT COULD MAKE NASA S ENVISIONED DEEP SPACE HUMAN EXPLORATION PROGRAM AFFORDABLE. CURRENT MODELS SUGGEST THAT FOR EVERY>140 M NEO  SUCH AS THOSE TARGETED BY THE CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE  THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY INTERMEDIATE SIZED (>40 METER CLASS) OBJECTS. INTERMEDIATE SIZED OBJECTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO IMPACT THE EARTH WITH DETRIMENTAL EFFECT BUT ARE NOT EFFICIENTLY IDENTIFIED BY CURRENT SURVEY METHODS. ONE SUCH EXAMPLE WAS THE CHELYABINSK METEOR WHICH HIT RUSSIA IN 2013 DAMAGING 7 000 BUILDINGS AND INJURING 1 491 PEOPLE. GOING FURTHER DOWN THE SIZE SCALE  FOR EACH 140 M OBJECT THERE ARE OVER>1 000 TEN METER OBJECTS AND MORE THAN>8 000 FIVE METER OBJECTS. DUE TO THEIR LARGE NUMBERS  THESE SMALLEST OF NEOS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE AS SPACE RESOURCE AND HUMAN EXPLORATION TARGETS  AND BECAUSE THEIR SIZE MAKES THEM EASIER TO CAPTURE AND WORK WITH USING REASONABLY SIZED EQUIPMENT  THEY ARE IDEALLY SUITED AS SOURCES OF ISRU SPACE RESOURCES. UNFORTUNATELY  NO SKY SURVEYS OR METHODS CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED OR PLANNED CAN FIND A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THESE MOST PLENTIFUL AND VALUABLE BUT ELUSIVE SMALL VOLATILE RICH TARGETS. SUTTER CHANGES ALL THAT. CONCEPT: TO SOLVE THIS CRITICAL UNMET NEED WE ENVISION A NEW TYPE OF LOW COST  HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPOUND TELESCOPE  THE COMPOUND SYNTHETIC TRACKER (CST) WHICH WE PROPOSE FOR A SERIES OF NEW SPACE MISSIONS THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF RECENT ADVANCES IN ELECTRONICS  CUBESAT TECHNOLOGY  LASER COMMUNICATIONS  AND OFF-THE-SHELF OPTICS FOR CAMERA ZOOM LENSES. THE FIRST SPACE MISSION CONCEPT WE PROPOSE BASED ON CST IS THE SUTTER SURVEY  NAMED AFTER THE SUTTER S MILL DISCOVERY WHICH LED TO THE CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH. THE SUTTER SURVEY PROJECT CAN LEAD TO A GOLD RUSH IN SPACE TO EXPLOIT THE RESOURCES OF THE SMALL HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE NEOS THAT WE INTEND TO FIND AND CHARACTERIZE. AS DEPICTED IN THE SUMMARY CHART  OUR CONCEPT INVOLVES A CONSTELLATION OF THREE CUBESAT SCALE SPACECRAFT IN HELIOCENTRIC SPACE EACH 120 DEGREES APART IN THE PLANE OF THE ECLIPTIC WITH A SEMI-MAJOR AXIS OF ABOUT 0.95 AU. WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS ENTIRE CONSTELLATION CAN BE BUILT FOR LESS THAN $50M  LAUNCHED AS PIGGY BACK PAYLOADS  AND PERFORM LIKE THE BILLION DOLLAR  8 M APERTURE LARGE SYNOPTIC SURVEY TELESCOPE (LSST) GROUND BASED TELESCOPE AT FINDING AND TRACKING SMALL DARK ASTEROIDS.

INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT (IEC) TECHNIQUES OFFER THE POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE OF CONSIDERABLY LOWER MASS  HOWEVER THEY SUFFER FROM LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE HAMPERED THEIR DEVELOPMENT  JUST AS PLASMA INSTABILITIES HAVE HAMPERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAGNETIC SYSTEMS. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT CONSIDERABLE TIME  EFFORT AND FUNDING HAVE GONE INTO THE ENGINEERING OF SOLUTIONS TO THE PLASMA INSTABILITY PROBLEM  WHEREAS THE LIMITATIONS OF IEC HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VIEWED AS  TOO FUNDAMENTAL . THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE THEREFORE TWO-FOLD: 1) TO RETIRE THE BROAD FUNDAMENTAL CRITICISMS OF IEC DEVICES BY DEMONSTRATING FEASIBLE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS  AND 2) TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM-LEVEL PERFORMANCE MODEL TO SUPPORT PARAMETRIC SCALING.  THE IMPACT OF SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVING THE TARGET SPECIFIC MASS OF 2 KG/KW CAN BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED JIMO SPACECRAFT. THE FULL DRY MASS WAS ABOUT 24 METRIC TONS  WITH 12 METRIC TONS OF XE PROPELLANT. THE FISSION REACTOR MODULE MASS WAS ESTIMATED AT JUST OVER 6 TONS  NOT INCLUDING ROUGHLY 2 TONS OF RADIATOR MASS.

PHYSICAL MECHANISMS INVOLVED ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD  AND MODEL EQUATIONS FOR THOSE MECHANISMS MAY NOT BE INCORPORATED EVEN IN STATE OF THE ART TCAD SIMULATORS. IT IS UNCLEAR WHY THE HEAVY ION RESPONSE OF SIC DEVICES DIFFERS SO MUCH FROM THAT OF SILICON POWER DIODES AND MOSFETS. EXPLANATIONS INCLUDE THE WIDE BAND GAP AND COMPLEX BAND STRUCTURE OF SIC  THE ANISOTROPIC STRUCTURE OF THE SIC CRYSTAL  LATTICE DEFECTS  AND LOCAL DISRUPTION OF THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE BY THE ENERGY DEPOSITION OF THE HEAVY ION. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO IDENTIFY THE PHYSICAL MECHANISMS IN THE HEAVY ION RESPONSE OF SILICON CARBIDE THROUGH PHYSICAL DEVICE ANALYSIS  ELECTRICAL AND RADIATION TESTING  AND DEVICE SIMULATION  AND TO DEVELOP NEW PHYSICS MODELS FOR TCAD DEVICE SIMULATION SOFTWARE. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE DEMONSTRATE THAT TWO POWER DIODES WITH SIMILAR GREATER THAN 1000 V BREAKDOWN VOLTAGES AND THE SAME DIMENSIONS  ONE SILICON AND ONE SIC  HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT CURRENT PULSE RESPONSE TO AN IDENTICAL ION STRIKE IN CURRENT TCAD MODELS. THE SIC CURRENT PULSE IS ABOUT 20 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE SILICON PULSE  AND LASTS ABOUT 2 TIMES LONGER. WE WILL INVESTIGATE WHY THE SAME ION SEEMS TO GENERATE VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSES EVEN WITH CONVENTIONAL MODELS IN SIC AND SILICON. ONE HYPOTHESIS FOR THE DESTRUCTIVE RESPONSE OF SIC POWER DIODES IS THAT HEAVY IONS DEPOSIT SUCH HIGH ENERGY DENSITY THE SIC CRYSTAL LATTICE IS DISRUPTED. THIS HYPOTHESIS IS HARD TO TEST IN TCAD SIMULATION. INVESTIGATING THE PHYSICS OF THIS HYPOTHESIS IS ONE OBJECTIVE FOR THIS WORK. OPEN QUESTIONS INCLUDE WHY THE SAME EFFECT IS NOT KNOWN TO OCCUR IN SILICON  AND IF THE MODEL HOLDS TRUE  WHAT ARE THE ALTERED MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF A POSSIBLY POLYCRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE AFTER MELTING OCCURS. WE WILL EVALUATE THE ROLES OF CARRIER ENERGY AND ENERGY TRANSFERRED TO THE LATTICE IN SIC DEVICES. ANISOTROPIC CARRIER TRANSPORT AND AVALANCHE MODELS WILL BE EMPLOYED.

SEGMENTED PRIMARY PUPILS POSE UNIQUE COMPENSATION PROBLEMS THAT CANNOT BE FULLY ADDRESSED BY STATE OF THE ART CONTINUOUS DEFORMABLE MIRRORS ON THE OPTICAL PATH.

USING NATURAL GUIDE STARS OF OPPORTUNITY DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH SIGNAL TO CLOSE THE WAVEFRONT CONTROL LOOP FAST ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THERMAL INSTABILITIES  JITTER  OR OTHER DRIFTS IN THE SYSTEM. WITHOUT STRONG GUIDESTARS FOR FAST WAVEFRONT CONTROL  WE WOULD NEED TO DESIGN AND BUILD TELESCOPES STABLE TO PICOMETERS OVER THE INTEGRATION TIME (MINUTES TO HOURS). WE PROPOSE A NEW SPACE TELESCOPE ARCHITECTURE THAT IS ANALOGOUS TO A LASER GUIDE STAR SYSTEM FOR GROUND TELESCOPES  WHERE ONE OR MORE EXTERNAL SMALL SATELLITE LASER GUIDE STARS (OPTICAL BEACONS) ARE PAIRED WITH A LARGE APERTURE SPACE TELESCOPE. THE SATELLITE LASER GUIDE STAR WILL BE BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SUPPORT FASTER UPDATES (HZ TO KHZ)  AND ABLE MOVE IN AND OUT OF THE FIELD OF VIEW OF THE TELESCOPE. SOME IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES TO THIS APPROACH INCLUDE: NEARLY COMMON PATH TO THE TARGET BEING IMAGED  AND MORE PHOTONS  WHICH ALLOW THE WAVEFRONT CONTROL LOOP TO RUN FASTER. THIS COULD GREATLY RELAX THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS ON THE TELESCOPE AND INTRODUCE A WHOLE NEW PARADIGM FOR HIGH CONTRAST TELESCOPES IN SPACE.

THE CUBESATS WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH ONE OR MORE PRECISELY-POINTED  POWER-EFFICIENT NARROW BEAMWIDTH LASER BEACONS AT WAVELENGTHS SELECTED FOR OPTIMAL WAVEFRONT SENSING AND CONTROL CAPABILITY WITH NO OR MINIMAL IMPACT TO THE SCIENCE. THE CUBESAT IS EQUIPPED WITH AN AGILE PROPULSION SYSTEM AND FLIES INDEPENDENTLY AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE LARGE TELESCOPE. THE NARROW LASER BEAM FROM THE CUBESAT IS A MUCH BRIGHTER SOURCE THAN NATURAL GUIDE STARS OF OPPORTUNITY NEAR THE TARGET. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE WAVEFRONT SENSING AND CONTROL SYSTEM ONBOARD THE LARGE TELESCOPE TO OPERATE IN A CLOSED-LOOP MODE OVER A WIDE RANGE OF BANDWIDTHS  SUCH AS FROM 0.1 HZ (SLOW  BUT FAST ENOUGH TO REMOVE DRIFT) TO MORE THAN 400 HZ (FAST ENOUGH TO REMOVE JITTER).

THIS CAPABILITY OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS ALLOWS THE HUMANS IN THE LOOP TO MAINTAIN PROPER SITUATION AWARENESS DURING A MISSION  WHICH IS ALSO CRITICAL WHEN THEY NEED TO UPDATE THE CURRENT SOLUTION IN CASE THE SITUATION CHANGES.

TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS WE PROPOSE TO USE MESOSCALE MODELING OF  A) THE SOLIDIFICATION PROCESS INCLUDING TWO DIFFERENT POROSITY MECHANISMS  AND  B) THE SUBSEQUENT HEAT TREATMENTS. A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE IS TO MODEL THE DEVELOPMENT OF POROSITY IN THE PRINTING OF METAL PARTS BECAUSE OF THE WELL-KNOWN CONNECTION BETWEEN FATIGUE CRACK INITIATION AND THE UPPER TAILS IN DEFECT SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS. FOR IN 718 PARTS PRODUCED BY POWDER BED FUSION  THE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF POROSITY ARE KEYHOLING  LACK OF FUSION AND PORES INHERITED FROM THE POWDERS. KEYHOLING IS AVOIDED BY MAINTAINING A SUFFICIENTLY LOW POWER DENSITY  AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED IN THIS PROJECT BECAUSE TYPICAL PRINTING CONDITIONS AVOID THIS PROBLEM. WITH REGARDS TO LACK OF FUSION POROSITY  WE HAVE DEVELOPED SOFTWARE TOOLS TO PREDICT THE VOLUME PERCENTAGE  SIZE AND SHAPE OF UNMELTED REGIONS IN THE PART.

THESE PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN TESTED AGAINST LITERATURE RESULTS AND IN THIS PROJECT THE ACCURACY OF THE PREDICTIONS AT MAXIMIZED BUILD RATES WILL BE EVALUATED FOR IN 718.  FOR PORES ARISING FROM THE POWDER PARTICLES THEMSELVES  THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT PORES BUBBLES IN THE METAL POWDER PARTICLES PERSIST IN THE MELTING AND SOLIDIFICATION PROCESS. THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT TIMES DURING WHICH A GIVEN VOLUME ELEMENT IS MOLTEN AND THE FINITE RISE RATES OF BUBBLES IN MELTS.

THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE A MODELING TOOL FOR GUIDING THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZING THE OPERATION OF ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS. THE KEY INNOVATION IS THE INCLUSION  FOR THE FIRST TIME  OF NOVEL PHYSICS DRIVING THE OPERATION OF THE NANOMETRIC REGIME. IN PARTICULAR  THE MODEL WILL INCLUDE: A) THE EQUATIONS OF THE LEAKY DIELECTRIC MODEL (I.E. CONSERVATION OF MASS  MOMENTUM AND SURFACE CHARGE; LAPLACE EQUATION FOR THE ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL; AND THE YOUNG- LAPLACE EQUATION FOR THE POSITION OF THE FREE SURFACE); B) A NOVEL TERM IN THE CHARGE CONSERVATION EQUATION TO MODEL ION EVAPORATION; AND C) A NOVEL ENERGY CONSERVATION EQUATION TO REPRODUCE THE NON-HOMOGENEOUS TEMPERATURE FIELD CAUSED BY ENERGY DISSIPATION. PROPELLANT PROPERTIES WILL RETAIN THEIR DEPENDENCE ON TEMPERATURE. THE DIRECT OUTCOMES OF THE MODEL ARE THE DEPENDENCE OF THE BEAM CURRENT  ION/DROPLET CURRENT FRACTIONS  JET DIAMETER  DROPLET CHARGE TO MASS RATIO  AND PRESSURE JUMP ACROSS THE LIQUID SURFACE ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE PROPELLANT  THE FLOW RATE  THE GEOMETRY OF THE ELECTRODES AND THE EMITTER TEMPERATURE. MODEL RESULTS WILL BE VALIDATED WITH EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS OF RELEVANT ELECTROSPRAY CHARACTERISTICS. THE INTEREST IN SMALLSATS HAS EXPLODED IN THE LAST TWO DECADES DUE TO ADVANCEMENTS IN ELECTRONICS  POWER AND FABRICATION TECHNIQUES  COMBINED WITH THE SIGNIFICANT LOWER MISSION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FABRICATION AND LAUNCH OF THESE PLATFORMS AS SECONDARY PAYLOADS. HOWEVER  THE CURRENT ABSENCE OF ADVANCED MICROPROPULSION IS PREVENTING THE USE OF SMALLSATS IN MISSIONS OF HIGH VALUE TO NASA SUCH AS SPACECRAFT CONSTELLATIONS  FORMATION FLYING  INSERTION INTO HIGH ALTITUDE ORBITS  INTERPLANETARY VOYAGE  ETC. THE MINIMUM THRUST AND POWER AT WHICH ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION CAN OPERATE  ITS HIGH EFFICIENCY  THE SMALL FOOTPRINT PER EMITTER  AND THE EASINESS FOR SCALE UP  MAKE ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION A TECHNOLOGY IDEAL FOR PRIMARY PROPULSION AND ATTITUDE CONTROL OF CUBESATS AND LARGER SMALLSATS. CONVENTIONAL ELECTRIC PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES BASED ON A PLASMA DISCHARGE (E.G. ION ENGINES AND HALL THRUSTERS)  ARE DIFFICULT TO MINIATURIZE BELOW POWER LEVELS OF TENS OF WATTS DUE TO INCREASING LOSSES AT DECREASING PLASMA DISCHARGE VOLUME  AND ARE LIKELY UNSUITABLE FOR THESE PLATFORMS WITH HIGHLY RESTRICTED VOLUME  MASS AND POWER BUDGETS. ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION IS THUS AN ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR SMALLSATS  AND A FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE OF HOW IT OPERATES IS NEEDED TO FULFILL ITS POTENTIAL. UNDERSTANDING HOW TO INCREASE THE CHARGE TO MASS RATIO OF ELECTROSPRAYED DROPLETS WHILE SUPPRESSING ION EVAPORATION  AND THEREFORE DEVELOPING THE CAPABILITY TO INCREASE THE ISP  WILL BE A MAYOR IMPROVEMENT AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL DERIVED FROM THIS PROJECT. CURRENTLY  THE ISP OF ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS OPERATING IN THE DROPLET AND DROPLET/ION MIXED REGIME IS A FEW HUNDRED SECONDS  A RELATIVELY LOW VALUE THAT LIMITS ITS USE FOR HYPOTHETICAL SMALLSAT MISSIONS REQUIRING HIGH DELTA-V (E.G.

THE MODULATOR /SEED LASER AND THE PHOTORECEIVER WILL BE DEVELOPED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA AND EACH WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO A SINGLE CUBESAT-COMPATIBLE ELECTRONICS BOARD. COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS WILL BE MADE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NASA AMES EDSN-DERIVED CUBESAT BUS  ALLOWING FOR A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO A FUTURE FLIGHT DEMONSTRATION. THE MODULATOR AND RECEIVER WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH A COMMERCIAL FIBER LASER AMPLIFIER AND A FAST BEAM-STEERING MIRROR PROVIDED BY MIT. IN RETURN  UF WILL PROVIDE A PHOTORECEIVER TO MIT FOR TESTING WITH THEIR OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. POINTING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE EVALUATED BASED ON THE SELECTED LASER PULSE ENERGY AND COMMUNICATIONS ACQUISITION STRATEGY  AS WELL AS ON THE ATTITUDE ACTUATION AUTHORITY OF THE EDSN CUBESAT BUS  WHICH RELIES ON A SET OF REACTION WHEELS FOR ATTITUDE CONTROL. THE COMPLETE CROSS-LINK OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM WILL BE TESTED IN THE LABORATORY AND DRIVEN BY A CONTROLLER THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO THE EDSN COMMAND AND DATA HANDLING SYSTEM.

THE CRYOGENIC LINEAR ACTUATION OF THIS CRYSTAL IS EXCEPTIONALLY REPEATABLE  PRECISE  AND RELIABLE WITH ALMOST NO FATIGUE DAMAGE  WHICH WOULD GUARANTEE THE LONG LIFETIME AND HIGH ACCURACY IN ACTUATION MOTION.

APPROACH: FIRST  IT IS NECESSARY TO GROW A LARGE SCALE  SINGLE CRYSTAL TO OBTAIN THE ACTUATION MOTION OVER 1 MM. WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THE CAPABILITY TO GROW MILLIMETER LENGTH SINGLE CRYSTAL CAFE2AS2 AND RELATED STRUCTURES BY USING SOLUTION GROWTH IN TIN FLUX. WE WILL BE ABLE TO SCALE UP THE CRYSTAL SIZE BY OPTIMIZING TEMPERATURE PRESSURE TIME CONDITION.

POTENTIAL IMPACT: THE CRYOGENIC LINEAR ACTUATION CAPABILITY OF NOVEL INTERMETALLIC COMPOUND  CAFE2AS2 AND RELATED STRUCTURES  WOULD HAVE THE GREAT POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP A NEW TYPE OF CRYOGENIC LINEAR ACTUATORS.

THESE PERFORMANCE DEGRADATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT IN CONVENTIONAL POLYCRYSTALLINE PIEZOELECTRIC MATERIALS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ADVANCE NASA S PORTFOLIO OF CAT BY CREATING A NOVEL ACTUATOR BASED ON THE CONVERSE FLEXOELECTRIC BEHAVIOR OF MOLYBDENUM DISULPHIDE (MOS2) THIN FILMS.

HEAT TRANSFER CAN BE FURTHER SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED BY APPLYING AN ELECTRIC FIELD TO PARTIALLY OR FULLY WETTED NANOSTRUCTURES  SINCE THE ELECTRIC FIELD REDUCES SURFACE TENSION OF MOST FLUIDS AND ALTERS DIRECTION OF FLUID MOTION AND FILM THICKNESSES ON THESE STRUCTURES. HEAT TRANSFER IS ALSO IMPROVED BY JET IMPINGEMENT OF THE COOLANT ON THE SURFACE  FOR EXAMPLE USING THE ELECTROSPRAY PROCESS  ALONG WITH EVAPORATION OF THE LIQUID FILM FORMED ON THE HOT SURFACE.

IN ANOTHER POTENTIAL CASE  NANO-CONE STRUCTURES ARE WETTED (INCREASING CONTACT AREA) AND ELECTROSPRAY IS INDUCED THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF A VOLTAGE BIAS  WHICH MAY ALSO IMPROVE HEAT TRANSFER.

SYSTEM PERFORMANCE FOR THIS APPLICATION WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH OBSERVING THE MAXIMUM HEAT FLUX THAT CAN BE DISSIPATED WHILE KEEPING THE MOCK PROCESSOR (AN ARRAY OF SUBSTRATE-DEPOSITED RESISTANCE HEATERS) BELOW THE MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE THAT WOULD BE PERMITTED FOR A PROCESSOR TO ACHIEVE (APPROXIMATELY 90 CELSIUS FOR TYPICAL SILICON PROCESSORS AND 125-150 CELSIUS FOR SILICON CARBIDE POWER ELECTRONICS).

THIS STUDY SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE COMPONENTS THAT IMPROVE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE COMPONENTS  DEVELOP COMPONENTS THAT DO NOT EXIST  AND DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY TO INTEGRATE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS IN A COMPACT PACKAGE. RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN SEMICONDUCTOR FABRICATION HAVE ENABLED IMPROVEMENTS OF ACTIVE AND PASSIVE COMPONENTS IN THE SUBMILLIMETER-WAVE RANGE. INDIUM PHOSPHIDE HETEROJUNCTION BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS ARE A PROMISING TECHNOLOGY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TERAHERTZ FREQUENCY ACTIVE COMPONENTS FOR SUBMILLIMETER-WAVE RADIOMETRY. WE WILL USE THE 130-NM INDIUM PHOSPHIDE (INP) DOUBLE HETEROJUNCTION BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR (DHBT) PROCESS DEVELOPED BY TELEDYNE SCIENTIFIC. TERAHERTZ MONOLITHIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (TMICS) CAN BE REALIZED WITH THIS PROCESS  WHICH ENABLE THE DESIGN OF A COMPACT RECEIVER ON A SINGLE CHIP.

A FREEFORM OPTICAL SYSTEM IS ONE THAT LACKS ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY  MEANING THERE IS NO CONSTRAINT ON THE SURFACE SHAPE OF THE MIRRORS. FREEFORM DESIGNS CAN MITIGATE THE DISADVANTAGES THAT PREVENT REFLECTIVE SYSTEMS FROM BEING USED IN LARGER FIELD OF VIEW APPLICATIONS BY YIELDING UNOBSCURED DESIGNS AND LEVERAGING THE ADDED FREEDOM OF SURFACE SHAPE TO BETTER CORRECT THE OPTICAL ABERRATIONS IN THE SYSTEM. FREEFORM DESIGNS ARE MADE UNOBSCURED BY BREAKING THE AXIS OF ROTATIONAL-SYMMETRY AND TILTING THE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS THEMSELVES. THEY DO NOT REQUIRE AN OFFSET APERTURE OR FIELD BIAS  WHICH BRINGS A UNIQUE ADVANTAGE IN THE CORRECTION OF OPTICAL ABERRATIONS. BY GETTING THE MIRRORS OUT OF THEIR OWN WAY  MORE SURFACES CAN BE INTRODUCED.

THEREFORE  TOROIDAL BASE MIRRORS FOR THE FREEFORM SURFACES ARE NEEDED FOR CORRECTION. ZERNIKE POLYNOMIALS ARE THEN INTRODUCED TO THE TOROIDAL BASE SHAPES TO FURTHER CORRECT THE SYSTEM. THE RESEARCH AIMS TO EXPLORE A VARIETY OF TARGETED RESEARCH QUESTIONS THAT AIM TO ADDRESS SPACE TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE DESIGNS FROM THE SOLUTION SPACE TO COMMON TOLERANCES WILL BE STUDIED USING FULL-FIELD DISPLAYS THAT ISOLATE EACH ABERRATION AND SHOW ITS DEPENDENCE OVER THE FIELD  COMBINED WITH NODAL ABERRATION THEORY THAT PUTS TOLERANCES IN LINEAR SPACE  MAKING THE SENSITIVITY CALCULATION EFFICIENT AND COMPLETE.

ONE  IT ALLOWS THE FUEL GRAINS TO BE 3D PRINTED WITHIN THE OVERALL SPACECRAFT STRUCTURE  THEREBY REPLACING STRUCTURAL MASS WITH USABLE FUEL. ONCE THE FUEL HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED  A PORTION OF THE STRUCTURE WILL REMAIN TO ENSURE THE SPACECRAFT STRUCTURE CONTINUES TO BE SOUND. SECOND  UNLIKE EXTRUDED ABS  3D PRINTED ABS POSSESSES THE CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE ELECTRICAL ARC IGNITION WHEN A VOLTAGE IS SENT THROUGH ELECTRODES EMBEDDED IN THE FUEL GRAIN. SUCH IGNITION COUPLED WITH THE HYBRID ROCKET MOTOR'S THROTTLING ABILITIES RESULTS IN A RELIABLY RESTARTABLE PROPULSIVE SYSTEM.

A SAFE  RELIABLE  RESTARTABLE PROPULSION SYSTEM IS DESIRABLE FOR SMALL SPACECRAFT THAT MUST PARTICIPATE IN RIDESHARES TO REACH ORBIT.

THERMOELECTRIC DEVICES PROVIDE A SIMPLE WAY TO CONVERT HEAT INTO ELECTRICITY WITHOUT ANY MOVING PARTS PROMOTING LONGTERM  MAINTENANCE FREE OPERATION. HOWEVER  CURRENT STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGIES ARE LIMITED IN THAT THEY ACHIEVE AN OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY OF AROUND 6 TO 7 PERCENT  ARE MADE OF EXPENSIVE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS  AND REQUIRE A VERY LARGE THERMAL GRADIENT IN ORDER TO PRODUCE ANY USEABLE POWER. OVER THE LAST DECADE  THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK HAS PROVED THAT NANOSTRUCTURING OF THE THERMOELECTRIC MATERIALS PROVIDES A VERY PROMISING MEANS FOR EFFECTIVELY INCREASING THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY THROUGH MEANS OF QUANTUM CONFINEMENT. THROUGH QUANTUM CONFINEMENT  IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL TRANSPORT OF A MATERIAL CAN BE DECOUPLED AND PROVIDE A MEANS OF INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY THROUGH INCREASING THE FIGURE OF MERIT  GIVEN BY ZT=F2OT/K  WHERE F IS SEEBECK COEFFICIENT  O IS ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY  AND K IS THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY.

THE RESEARCH PROPOSED WITHIN AIMS TO FURTHER EXPLORE THIS AREA OF NANOSTRUCTURED THERMOELECTRICS BY CREATING A NEW THERMOELECTRIC MATERIAL BASED OFF OF POLYMER DERIVED CERAMICS. POLYMER DERIVED CERAMICS (PDCS) ARE A CLASS OF SILICON BASED  AMORPHOUS CERAMIC MATERIALS THAT ARE CREATED THROUGH THE THERMAL DECOMPOSITION OF POLYMERIC PRECURSORS. PDCS OFFER A VERY HIGH THERMAL STABILITY (~1300-1500OC)  HAVE A HIGH MECHANICAL STRENGTH  AS WELL AS OXIDATION  CORROSION  AND IRRADIATION STABILITY. LIKE THEIR POLYMERIC PRECURSORS  THEY ALSO POSSESS AN INHERENTLY LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY. HOWEVER  SIMPLE PDCS FACE THE CHALLENGES OF LOW ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND CHARGE CARRIER DENSITIES. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT 1) INTRODUCING ANISOTROPIC GRAPHENE FILLERS INTO THE AMORPHOUS SICN PDC MATRIX IMPROVES THE CHARGE TRANSPORT EFFICIENCY BUT DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO PHONON TRANSPORT DUE TO MULTIPLE LENGTH SCALE SCATTERING 2) THE BAND STRUCTURE OF SICN CAN BE TUNED FOR EFFICIENT CHARGE TRANSFER AT SICN/CARBON INTERFACES AND 3) INCORPORATING NICKEL NANOPARTICLES INTO SICN COMPOSITE INCREASES THE SCATTERING OF LOW ENERGY ELECTRONS AND REDUCES THE ELECTRON PHONON COUPLING  LEADING TO AN INCREASE OF THE FIGURE OF MERIT.

I SEEK TO DISCOVER THE PATHS TOWARDS THE OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION BY DETERMINING THE SYSTEMATIC WAYS IN WHICH INCREMENTAL CONTINUOUS OR DISCRETE CHANGES IN CONFIGURATION AFFECT A LIMB'S MOTION. EVEN WITH SUCH PATHWAY INFORMATION TO SPEED UP THE SEARCH  THERE WILL BE MANY NEARLY OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE I PLAN TO TAKE INSPIRATION FROM BIOLOGY  WHICH HAS EXAMPLES OF HOW MODULARITY SERVED SUCCESSFUL ADAPTABLE IN ANIMALS  LIKE INSECTS AND OTHER ARTHROPODS.

HOWEVER  NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS OFFER POTENTIAL WAYS TO DOWNLOAD MASS AMOUNTS OF DATA MUCH QUICKER THAN BEFORE  AND MEMORY STORAGE ON A CUBESAT IS BECOMING MORE CAPABLE.

WITH THE INCREASING AMBITION TO USHER IN A NEW ERA OF EXPLORATION BEYOND OUR PLANET AND SOLAR SYSTEM  THE SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY OF CHALLENGES THAT SPACE TECHNOLOGISTS FACE HAS GREATLY INCREASED. AS THE TECHNOLOGY ROADMAPS ILLUSTRATE  THERE ARE SEVERAL FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING THAT NEED TO BE FURTHER DEVELOPED BEFORE HUMANITY S REACH IN SPACE CAN BE EXPANDED. AS AN ASPIRING SPACE TECHNOLOGIST  I SEEK TO ADDRESS NASA S FOURTH ROADMAP: ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTONOMOUS ON-ORBIT ASSEMBLY AND SERVICING TECHNOLOGY. THIS IS STILL NOT POSSIBLE TODAY  YET IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR FUTURE MISSIONS TO MARS AND BEYOND. WITH AUTONOMOUS ASSEMBLY SYSTEMS  SPACECRAFT SIZE COULD INCREASE AS THEY WOULD NO LONGER BE CONSTRAINED BY LAUNCH VEHICLE SIZE OR THE RISK OF UTILIZING A MANNED CREW. FURTHERMORE  WITH THE ENABLING OF AUTONOMOUS SERVICING TECHNOLOGY  THE LIFETIME OF IMPORTANT SPACECRAFT COULD BE EXTENDED THROUGH THE REPAIRING OR SWAPPING OF OUTDATED/BROKEN COMPONENTS. HOWEVER  THE LONG TERM VISION OF THE UTILIZATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS IN THE ASSEMBLY OF SPACE STATIONS AND OTHER STRUCTURES ORBITING PLANETS FAR FROM EARTH PRIOR TO ASTRONAUT ARRIVAL. THE SYNCHRONIZED POSITION HOLD  ENGAGE  AND REORIENT EXPERIMENTAL SATELLITE (SPHERES) TESTBED DEVELOPED BY THE MIT SPACE SYSTEMS LABORATORY (SSL) IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY SCALABLE SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES BOTH TESTING OF CONTROL AND AUTONOMY ALGORITHMS ON EARTH AND IN 6DOF MICROGRAVITY VIA THE ISS. AS A MEMBER OF THE MIT SSL  THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE TO DEVELOP AUTONOMOUS ASSEMBLY AND SERVICING ALGORITHMS THROUGH INCREMENTAL ITERATIVE TESTING USING THE SPHERES PLATFORM. THE SPHERES UNIVERSAL DOCKING PORT (UDP) AND HALO EXPANSION PORT (WHICH ALLOWS UP TO 6 DOCKING PORT ATTACHMENTS) WILL BE USED JOINTLY WITH SPHERES TO TEST THE AUTONOMOUS ASSEMBLY/SERVICING ALGORITHMS. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS AN INTEGRAL PART OF AUTONOMOUS ASSEMBLY TECHNOLOGY  ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT WILL BEGIN WITH DEVELOPING ROBUST AUTONOMOUS DOCKING ALGORITHMS BETWEEN A SPHERES SATELLITE AND A SPHERES/HALO UNIT (ADDRESSING 4.6 OF TA04). THIS CAN THEN BE EXPANDED TO MULTIPLE SPHERES DOCKING TO THE SAME HALO UNIT  MULTIPLE SPHERES DOCKING TO A SPINNING HALO UNIT (AND STABILIZING IT)  VISION BASED UDP AVAILABILITY IDENTIFICATION (VIA CAMERAS LOCATED ON THE UDPS)  AND A SPHERES SATELLITE HAVING TO AVOID OBSTACLES BEFORE DOCKING TO A HALO UNIT. FURTHERMORE  CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING HOW TO CONTROL AN AUTONOMOUSLY DOCKED SYSTEM WILL BE TO CONTINUE SSL LEAD RESEARCH INTO UNDERSTANDING HOW TO ADAPT ONBOARD CONTROL/AUTONOMY ALGORITHMS AND ACTUATION TO THE NEW INERTIAL PROPERTIES OF THE AGGREGATE SYSTEM. WITH ROBUST AUTONOMOUS DOCKING ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED  TESTS COULD THEN BE DEVISED TO SIMULATE AUTONOMOUS ASSEMBLY/SERVICING SCENARIOS. FOR EXAMPLE  IF TWO SPHERES/HALO UNITS ARE DOCKED TOGETHER BY A SINGLE PORT  AN EXTERNAL SPHERE COULD DOCK TO ONE SPHERES/HALO UNIT  DETACH IT FROM THE OTHER  MANEUVER IT TO A NEW LOCATION  AND REATTACH IT AT ANOTHER HALO PORT. ASSEMBLY SCHEMES SUCH AS THIS CAN BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED WITH INCREASING COMPLEXITY AND DIFFICULTY  ADDRESSING CRITICAL STEPS FOR THE MATURATION OF AUTONOMOUS ASSEMBLY AND SERVICING TECHNOLOGY. SPHERES PROVIDES A UNIQUE TESTBED IN WHICH ALGORITHMS DESIGNED FOR AUTONOMOUS SPACE SYSTEMS CAN BE TESTED FOR LONG DURATIONS IN MICROGRAVITY. WITH THE SUCCESS OF SPHERES FORMATION FLIGHT ABOARD THE ISS  AUTONOMOUS ASSEMBLY AND SERVICING PROVIDES A LOGICAL NEXT STEP IN THE MATURATION OF THE USE OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY.

THE PROPOSED METHOD WILL DEVELOP AND VALIDATE QUANTITATIVE METRICS FOR DECISIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY MADE QUALITATIVELY WITH REGARD TO A SPACESUIT DESIGN'S RISK TO ASTRONAUT HEALTH AND INJURY DURING EVA OPERATIONS.

THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE COMPACT FLEXIBLE STRAIN GAUGES THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO ARBITRARY STRUCTURES. RESEARCHES HAVE DEPENDED ON NANOMATERIALS TO DEVELOP THESE SYSTEMS  THE MOST PROMISING OF WHICH IS GRAPHENE  A SINGLE ATOM THICK LAYER OF CARBON THAT EXHIBITS EXCELLENT MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES  WHICH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED IN STRAIN SENSORS  BUT REQUIRES ADVANCEMENT IN SENSITIVITY AND EASE OF INTEGRATION TO BE USEFUL. HEREIN IS PROPOSED A STACKED BIAXIALLY TEXTURED GRAPHENE STRAIN SENSOR (SBTGRP) FOR STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING WHICH TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TWO MATING SHEETS OF TEXTURED GRAPHENE WHEN SUBJECT TO STRAIN TO MEASURE CHANGES TO A SYSTEM. CRUMPLED GRAPHENE CONSISTS OF GRAPHENE WHICH HAS BEEN DEFORMED TO ADOPT A CRUMPLED SURFACE; THIS UNIQUE TOPOGRAPHY OFFERS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES IN DEVELOPING STRAIN SENSORS  MOST OBVIOUSLY INCREASED CONFORMABILITY. THE MOST INTERESTING POSSIBILITY FOR STRAIN SENSING IS BASED ON THE INTERACTION OF TWO LAYERS OF TEXTURED GRAPHENE. TWO MATING CRUMPLED GRAPHENE SHEETS MAKE CONTACT AT THE TIPS OF THE CORRUGATIONS ON THEIR SURFACES  THESE POINTS OF CONTACT SERVE AS ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS AND THE PREVALENCE OF THESE CONTACTS CAN BE GAUGED BY MEASURING THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO LAYERS. IF THIS STACKED SYSTEM IS STRETCHED THE CRUMPLED GRAPHENE WILL BEGIN TO ADOPT A FLATTER CONFIGURATION AND THE HEIGHT OF THE CORRUGATIONS WILL DECREASE  REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CONTACT POINTS  INCREASING THE RESISTANCE  AND ALLOWING FOR DETERMINATION OF THE STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED SBTGRPS FOR HUMAN BODY MOTION MONITORING BUT THEY REMAIN TO BE OPTIMIZED FOR USE IN STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING. DEVELOPMENT OF THESE SENSORS WILL ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF AN INTEGRATED HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY OF FUTURE MISSIONS BY OFFERING A METHOD FOR LIFE ASSESSMENT. THE MAIN GOALS IN OPTIMIZING SBTGRPS ARE: PERFECTING THEIR FABRICATION METHOD  QUANTIFYING THEIR RESPONSE TO VARIOUS MODES OF FORCING  INCREASING THEIR SENSITIVITY TO THE LOW AMPLITUDE STRAINS OF INTEREST FOR STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING  AND INTEGRATING MULTIPLE STRAIN SENSORS INTO AN ARRAY TO ACHIEVE FULL MULTIMODAL DEFORMATION SENSING. WHILE CURRENT STRAIN SENSORS ARE TESTED IN RESPONSE TO NORMAL STRAINS  IN REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS THE SYSTEMS WILL BE SUBJECT TO MULTIPLE MODES OF FORCING  THEREFORE IT IS NECESSARY TO FULLY CHARACTERIZE SENSOR BEHAVIOR  USING TENSION AND TORSIONAL TESTING STAGES  UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. THIS SERIES OF TESTS WILL ALLOW FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIQUE SENSOR BEHAVIOR WHICH MAY BE USED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TYPES OF STRAIN AS WELL AS GAUGE THEIR RELIABILITY. MORE IMPORTANTLY  THE QUALITY OF SENSING IS DICTATED BY THE CONDITIONS AT THE INTERFACE  THEREFORE SENSITIVITY COULD BE INCREASED VIA CAREFUL CONTROL OF THE INTERFACE CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN THE TWO CRUMPLED GRAPHENE LAYERS. OF PRIMARY INTEREST IS DETERMINING HOW THE INITIAL DEGREE OF CRUMPLING OF THE UPPER AND LOWER GRAPHENE LAYERS AFFECTS SENSITIVITY. A HIGH DEGREE OF INITIAL CRUMPLING LEADS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF INTERLAYER CONTACTS AND THEREFORE WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE STRETCHING TO GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DISCONNECTIONS THEREFORE REDUCING SENSITIVITY TO LOW STRAINS. THEREFORE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO INCREASE SENSITIVITY BY REDUCING THE DEGREE OF INITIAL CRUMPLING.

RECENT FOCUSED INVESTIGATIONS OF SIMPLE SINGLE- AND DUAL- PATH SURFACE CATALYZED RECOMBINATION REACTIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT MEASUREMENTS OF REACTIVE SPECIES FLUXES ARRIVING AT THE SURFACE CAN BE USED TO QUANTIFY REACTION RATES AND RECOMBINATION EFFICIENCIES. THESE MEASUREMENTS HAVE PROVIDED USEFUL INFORMATION FOR PHYSICS-BASED GAS/SURFACE INTERACTION MODEL DEVELOPMENT.

HOWEVER  AS SPACECRAFT BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED AND INTERACT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IN NOVEL WAYS  THEIR CAPABILITIES WILL BECOME LIMITED BY THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN MITIGATING SPACECRAFT CHARGING. NASA IDENTIFIES THE IMPACT OF SPACECRAFT CHARGING AS AN AREA THAT REQUIRES FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THIS CROSS CUTTING TECHNOLOGY AREA DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIGH POWER SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION FOR FUTURE SPACE MISSIONS. UNDER THE POWER GENERATION TECHNOLOGY AREA BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (TABS) 3.1.3 THE CHALLENGE IS FOR SOLAR POWER GENERATION TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE WHILE INTERACTING WITH VARIOUS AMBIENT ENVIRONMENTS AS WELL AS THE PLASMA GENERATED BY HIGH POWER ELECTRIC PROPULSION THRUSTERS. THESE CONDITIONS CREATE A COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE SPACECRAFT S CHARGING BEHAVIOR AND MITIGATE ITS EFFECTS. AN ACTIVE METHOD OF SPACECRAFT CHARGE MITIGATION USES A HOLLOW CATHODE PLASMA SOURCE TO BALANCE THE CHARGE ON THE SPACECRAFT BY EMITTING CHARGED PARTICLES THROUGH ITS PLASMA PLUME. THEY ARE CURRENTLY USED ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) AND THE DEFENSE SATELLITE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM SATELLITE B-7 (DSCS-III B-7); HOWEVER IT IS UNCLEAR IF THEY ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL CONDITIONS. THESE SPACECRAFT LEND THEMSELVES TO BE VALUABLE RESOURCES AS PLATFORMS FOR EXPERIMENTATION. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF SPACECRAFT CHARGING FOR COMPLEX  HIGH POWER SPACECRAFT IN BOTH STEADY-STATE AND TRANSIENT CONDITIONS. USING DATA FROM THE ISS AND DSCS-III B-7 IN CONJUNCTION WITH GROUND EXPERIMENTS  THE PLAN IS TO CREATE A HYBRID MODEL OF SPACECRAFT CHARGING BEHAVIOR AND PREDICT EFFECTIVE MITIGATION TECHNIQUES. EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM SPACECRAFT WILL SHOW THE CHARGING VARIATIONS IN THE AMBIENT SPACE ENVIRONMENT. GROUND PLASMA CHAMBER EXPERIMENTS WILL THEN ALLOW THE DEPENDENCE BETWEEN PLASMA SOURCE PARAMETERS AND THE AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT TO BE STUDIED. THE MODEL WILL BE VALIDATED USING IN-ORBIT MEASUREMENTS FROM THE ISS. THE GROUND EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT THE PLASMADYNAMICS AND ELECTRIC PROPULSION LABORATORY (PEPL). THE SIMULATED SPACECRAFT AND PLASMA SOURCE WILL BE ELECTRICALLY ISOLATED FROM GROUND TO PROVIDE CHARGE TO THE SYSTEM. THE PARAMETERS OF THE PLASMA SOURCE WILL BE VARIED AS WELL AS AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS. THE ENVIRONMENT WILL ALSO BE SIMULATED AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS WAY  THE SPACECRAFT CHARGING BEHAVIOR CAN BE OBSERVED IN RELATION TO CHANGES IN THE PLASMA SOURCE AND THE NEARBY (AMBIENT SPACE) ENVIRONMENT. THE SPACECRAFT CHARGING MODEL WILL CONTAIN TWO MAIN COMPONENTS: A SPACECRAFT STRUCTURE AND PLASMA PLUME. TO CAPTURE THE EFFECT OF SPACECRAFT GEOMETRY  THE STRUCTURES ARE TREATED AS A CIRCUIT. CAPACITANCES  INDUCTANCES  AND RESISTANCES WILL BE CALCULATED FOR EACH SECTION OF THE SPACECRAFT WHILE THE PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS AND COLLECTED CURRENT WILL BE REGARDED AS NON-LINEAR VOLTAGE DEPENDENT SOURCES. THE PLASMA PLUME WILL BE MODELED USING A COLLISIONAL BOLTZMANN EQUATION TO OBTAIN DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS FOR THE PLUME S CHARGED PARTICLES. THIS PROPOSAL S GOALS AND FOCUS ARE SYNERGISTIC WITH THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT NASA S MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER (MSFC). MANY RESEARCHERS WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN SPACECRAFT CHARGING WORK AT NASA S MSFC.

COMPOSITE STRUCTURES OFFER MANY ADVANTAGES TO THEIR METAL COUNTERPARTS IN TERMS OF WEIGHT  STRENGTH  AND DURABILITY. HOWEVER  UNLIKE IN METAL STRUCTURES WHERE BOLTING AND RIVETING ARE WIDESPREAD  ADHESIVE BONDING IS THE PREFERRED METHOD TO JOIN TWO COMPOSITE MATERIALS. CONSEQUENTLY  A METHOD TO QUANTITATIVELY DETERMINE THE STRENGTH OF AN ADHESIVE BOND MUST BE USED TO ENSURE STRENGTH AND STABILITY OF ADHESIVELY BONDED STRUCTURES. UNFORTUNATELY  CONVENTIONAL NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION TECHNIQUES HAVE PROVED UNABLE TO ENSURE DETECTION OF WEAK BONDS OR QUANTITATIVELY MEASURE BOND STRENGTH. THEREFORE  A NEW NONDESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUE IS BEING PROPOSED FOR QUANTITATIVELY MEASURING ADHESIVE BOND STRENGTH. THIS TECHNIQUE USES AN ULTRASONIC SIGNAL AND AN INTERFEROMETRIC CONSTANT FREQUENCY PULSED PHASED-LOCKED LOOP (CFPPLL) CIRCUIT TO MEASURE THE PHASE RESPONSE OF A BONDED REGION DUE TO THERMAL STRESS. THEORETICAL RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE THERMAL PROPERTIES OF A BONDED STRUCTURE SHOULD HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE QUALITY OF THE ADHESIVE BOND. THESE PROPERTIES SHOULD BE MEASURABLE USING THIS ULTRASONIC PHASE-BASED TECHNIQUE. ANOTHER TECHNIQUE THAT RELIES UPON THE FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE OF THE REFLECTION COEFFICIENT OF THE BONDED INTERFACE WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED USING THE CFPPLL INSTRUMENT. THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS INSTRUMENT SHOULD ALSO ALLOW IT TO DETECT VERY WEAK OR KISSING BONDS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY UNDETECTABLE. THROUGH THIS RESEARCH PROJECT  THESE TECHNIQUES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED USING A VARIETY OF ADHESIVES AND BONDED MATERIALS  AND THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT EACH OF THE MAJOR TYPES OF BOND DEFECTS WILL BE EXAMINED. ADDITIONALLY  THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TECHNIQUE TO VERY THIN BONDS WILL BE STUDIED. MATHEMATICAL MODELS TO DESCRIBE THE ACOUSTIC RESPONSES TO STRESSES IN A BONDED REGION ARE ALSO BEING DEVELOPED. ADHESIVE BONDS UNDER FAILURE LOADS WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED FOR THEIR PHASE RESPONSE TO ULTRASONIC INTERROGATION. COMPUTATIONAL MODELING WILL BE USE TO VERIFY THESE RESULTS TO PROMOTE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANICS OF BOND FAILURE TO PHYSICS AT LARGE.

AT THE SAME TIME  THE SMALLER SCALES AND VAST NUMBER OF ASTEROIDS AND COMETS OFTEN REQUIRES RAPID RECALCULATION OF ORBITS AND TRAJECTORIES. PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THESE CONFLICTING REALITIES IS THE FUNDAMENTAL ABILITY TO RAPIDLY DESIGN TRAJECTORIES AROUND SMALL BODIES. BY APPLYING AND ENHANCING FAST GRAVITY FIELD TECHNIQUES  IMPLEMENTING GRID SEARCHES AND ROOT SOLVERS TO FIND USEFUL PERIODIC AND QUASI-PERIODIC ORBITS  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AIMS TO CREATE AND INNOVATIVELY USE A NEW CATALOGUE OF TRAJECTORIES AROUND SMALL BODIES OF INTEREST TO ENABLE RAPID TRAJECTORY DESIGN IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS.

AMONG THESE ARE: 1) ADAPTIVE COMPUTATION OF THE POTENTIAL FIELD MUST BE FAST AND EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO ALLOW RAPID EXPLORATION OF THE TRAJECTORY DESIGN SPACE  SCIENCE INSTRUMENT AND EXPERIMENT SIMULATIONS  AND IN-MISSION TRAJECTORY RE-DESIGN; AND  2) ACCELERATION VALUES MUST ADHERE CLOSELY ENOUGH TO REALITY TO PROVIDE ACCURATE TRAJECTORIES  EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF DYNAMICS UNCERTAINTY AND THE NEED FOR RIGOROUS MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS.

MODERN SMALL-BODY ORBIT AND TRAJECTORY DESIGN METHODS DO NOT TYPICALLY INCLUDE HIGHER-ORDER SHAPE IRREGULARITIES IN THEIR DYNAMICAL MODELS  NOR DO STUDIES DEVELOPING MORE DETAILED GRAVITY FIELD MODELS CONDUCT COMPREHENSIVE ORBIT AND TRAJECTORY SEARCHES USING THOSE MODELS.

BUT BEYOND THE NATURAL PROTECTION MECHANISMS OF THE EARTH  THE SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT CAN BE DANGEROUS FOR ASTRONAUTS. IT PUTS THEM AT RISK OF SEVERAL SEVERE HEALTH PROBLEMS  INCLUDING CANCER  CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE  AND CATARACTS. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL SOURCES OF IONIZING RADIATION IN SPACE  ONE OF THE GREATEST CAUSES FOR CONCERN ARE GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS (GCRS). GCRS ARE ISOTROPIC AND LOW IN FLUX. THEY ARE A SOURCE OF CHRONIC RADIATION EXPOSURE  PUTTING ASTRONAUT HEALTH AT RISK GRADUALLY OVER TIME. GCRS ARE MOSTLY COMPOSED OF PROTONS AND HELIUM NUCLEI  BUT THE LARGEST CONCERN FOR HUMAN HEALTH COMES FROM THEIR MINORITY HEAVY ION COMPONENT. THE HEAVY IONS IN GCRS CAN POTENTIALLY PENETRATE SHIELDING AND HUMAN TISSUE. IN THE INTEREST OF ENABLING A LONG-TERM LUNAR OR MARTIAN MISSION  THE RADIATION PROTECTION SYSTEMS SHOULD BE IMPROVED TO BETTER PROTECT AGAINST GCRS. ONE RADIATION PROTECTION METHOD IS PASSIVE SHIELDING. A PASSIVE RADIATION SHIELD IS A MATERIAL THAT IS PLACED BETWEEN A RADIATION SOURCE AND A RADIOSENSITIVE TARGET  DESIGNED TO ABSORB THE RADIATION BEFORE IT REACHES THE TARGET. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE IS A PATIENT WEARING A LEAD APRON OVER HIS OR HER VITAL ORGANS  WHILE BEING EXPOSED TO X-RAYS AT A HOSPITAL. IN SPACE  PASSIVE RADIATION SHIELDING IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT SOUNDS  BECAUSE THE VARIATIONS IN PARTICLE COMPOSITION AND ENERGY SPECTRA MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A CATCHALL SHIELD.

FOR SHORT-TERM MISSIONS IT IS MOST RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE TO TRANSPORT WATER FROM EARTH  BUT FOR LONG-TERM MISSIONS BEYOND THE EARTH S ORBIT  WATER MUST BE RECYCLED FROM WASTEWATER SOURCES SUCH AS URINE  HUMIDITY CONDENSATE  AND HYGIENIC WASH WATER. MAINTAINING AN OPEN-LOOP WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM IS SIMPLY NOT FEASIBLE FOR SUCH LONG-DISTANCE MISSIONS. ONE CHALLENGE TO CLOSING THIS SUPPLY LOOP AND INCREASING THE WATER RECOVERY RATES IS THAT AS WATER IS EXTRACTED FROM WASTEWATER SOURCES  CONTAMINANTS BECOME MORE CONCENTRATED IN THE WASTEWATER  AND SOLIDS BEGIN TO PRECIPITATE FROM THE WASTEWATER/BRINE AND FOUL THE TREATMENT SYSTEMS. ONE PROMISING TECHNOLOGY FOR TREATING CONCENTRATED SPACE MISSION WASTEWATER IS MEMBRANE DISTILLATION. MEMBRANE DISTILLATION IS A THERMALLY-DRIVEN TECHNOLOGY THAT USES A HYDROPHOBIC MEMBRANE TO SEPARATE PURE WATER VAPOR FROM THE HEATED LIQUID WASTEWATER STREAM FROM WHICH THE WATER VAPORIZES. THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE POWERED BY LOW-GRADE WASTE HEAT AND IS MORE RESISTANT TO FOULING THAN PRESSURE-DRIVEN SYSTEMS SUCH AS REVERSE OSMOSIS. HOWEVER  BECAUSE FOULING/SCALING IS STILL AN ISSUE IN MEMBRANE DISTILLATION  MY PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND AND MITIGATE THIS SCALING. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE TO UNDERSTAND THE CHEMISTRY BEHIND SCALING OF SPACE MISSION WASTEWATER  TO UNDERSTAND HOW MEMBRANE SURFACE PROPERTIES AFFECT SCALING  AND TO DEVELOP ANTI-SCALING METHODOLOGIES FOR MEMBRANE DISTILLATION SYSTEMS. TO UNDERSTAND THE CHEMISTRY BEHIND SCALING  I WILL PERFORM EXPERIMENTS USING A MODEL SPACE MISSION WASTEWATER SOLUTION AND ANALYZE THE PRODUCED SCALE AND THE WATER CONSTITUENTS TO DETERMINE WHICH CHEMICALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SCALING. ALSO OF INTEREST IS WHETHER PARTICLE AGGREGATION LEADING TO SCALING OCCURS IN SOLUTION PRIOR TO PRECIPITATION ONTO THE MEMBRANE  OR WHETHER THIS AGGREGATION OCCURS DIRECTLY ON THE MEMBRANE. AFTER STUDYING THE CHEMISTRY OF SCALING  EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED USING MEMBRANES HAVING A VARIETY OF SURFACE PROPERTIES  INCLUDING DIFFERENT PORE SIZES  DEGREES OF HYDROPHOBICITY  AND MEMBRANE MATERIALS. THIS WILL GIVE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF HOW WASTEWATER CHEMISTRY AND MEMBRANE SURFACE PROPERTIES AFFECT THE SCALING PROCESS. THE FINAL AND MOST PRACTICAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY DEVELOPING ANTI-SCALING METHODOLOGIES WILL BE GUIDED BY THE PREVIOUS PHASES PROVIDING UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCALING PROCESS. SEVERAL POTENTIAL METHODS FOR MITIGATING SCALING INCLUDE USING NANOTECHNOLOGY TO MODIFY THE MEMBRANE SURFACE  SELECTIVELY REMOVING SCALING IONS  AND MODIFYING THE HYDROPHOBICITY/HYDROPHILICITY OF THE MEMBRANE SURFACE. ANOTHER INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUE INVOLVES THE USE OF A NANOTEMPLATE THAT CREATES AN ENERGETIC PREFERENCE FOR PARTICLES TO AGGREGATE ON THE NANOTEMPLATE INSTEAD OF ON THE MEMBRANE. BY IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SCALE FORMATION DURING MEMBRANE DISTILLATION OF SPACE MISSION WASTEWATER AND BY FINDING WAYS TO MITIGATE THIS SCALING  THIS RESEARCH WILL MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARD CLOSING THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT/WATER SUPPLY LOOP. THIS TYPE OF SELF-SUSTAINING LIFE SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY WILL ENABLE NASA TO PENETRATE FURTHER INTO SPACE  OPENING THE DOOR FOR FURTHER DISCOVERIES. HOWEVER  MY RESEARCH ALSO HAS TREMENDOUS APPLICATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS ON EARTH  SINCE SCALE FORMATION AND MITIGATION ARE CRITICAL ISSUES IN ALL MEMBRANE-BASED TREATMENT SYSTEMS.

LOW-THRUST SPACECRAFT MOTION IS GOVERNED BY A SENSITIVE SYSTEM OF NONLINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS  AND THIS MAKES FINDING DESIRABLE TRAJECTORIES CHALLENGING. CURRENT LOW-THRUST TRAJECTORY DESIGN METHODS RELY HEAVILY ON OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES TO OBTAIN FEASIBLE TRAJECTORIES. THESE TECHNIQUES REQUIRE AN INITIAL GUESS FOR THE SPACECRAFT TRAJECTORY AND THIS GUESS HEAVILY IMPACTS THE FINAL OPTIMIZED TRAJECTORY. MANY LOCALLY OPTIMAL TRAJECTORIES ARE AVAILABLE AND A PRECISE INITIAL GUESS CAN LEAD TO THE MOST DESIRABLE LOCALLY  OR EVEN GLOBALLY  OPTIMAL TRAJECTORY. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD INITIAL GUESS IN LOW-THRUST TRAJECTORY DESIGN  RELATIVELY FEW COMPREHENSIVE METHODS EXIST FOR CREATING THESE GUESSES. A METHOD FOR GENERATING A WIDE ARRAY OF INITIAL GUESSES AND SELECTING ONE THAT BEST FITS A SET OF PREFERRED CRITERIA IS DESIRABLE BECAUSE IT WOULD EXPAND THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOW-THRUST TRAJECTORIES. ONE TOOL THAT SHOWS PROMISE FOR DEVELOPING INITIAL GUESSES FOR LOW-THRUST TRAJECTORIES IS THE THEORY OF INVARIANT MANIFOLDS. IN ASTRODYNAMICS INVARIANT MANIFOLDS CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS STRUCTURES THAT SHOW THE NATURAL FLOW OF GRAVITATIONAL FORCES ABOUT A PERIODIC ORBIT. THE MANIFOLDS OF LOW-THRUST PERIODIC ORBITS ARE LIKELY HELPFUL FOR PRODUCING A RANGE OF DETAILED INITIAL GUESSES FOR LOW-THRUST TRAJECTORIES. THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION WILL STUDY HOW THE MANIFOLDS OF LOW-THRUST PERIODIC ORBITS CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE IMPROVED INITIAL GUESSES FOR LOW-THRUST SPACECRAFT TRAJECTORIES. THE STUDY WILL BEGIN BY COMPUTING LOW-THRUST PERIODIC ORBITS AND OBTAINING THE MANIFOLDS OF THESE ORBITS. FOLLOWING THIS  A VARIETY OF VISUALIZATION METHODS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO UNDERSTAND MANIFOLD BEHAVIOR  THESE INCLUDE POINCARE MAPS AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL PLOTS. THE INTUITION GAINED FROM THESE VISUALIZATIONS WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A SCHEME FOR CATEGORIZING MANIFOLD BEHAVIOR. UNDERSTANDING GAINED FROM VISUALIZATION AND CATEGORIZATION WILL BE APPLIED TO LOW-THRUST MISSION DESIGN. A NUMBER OF REALISTIC MISSION SCENARIOS WILL BE TESTED  INCLUDING POLESITTING ORBITS AND TRANSFERS FROM THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM TO OTHER BODIES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A SPACECRAFT CAN LEVERAGE THE MANIFOLDS OF A LOW-THRUST PERIODIC ORBIT WITHOUT ENTERING THE ORBIT. THEREFORE  A LOW-THRUST PERIODIC ORBIT DOES NOT NEED TO BE THE FINAL DESTINATION OF A SPACECRAFT IN ORDER FOR THIS MISSION DESIGN METHOD TO BE OF USE. THE PROPOSED MISSION DESIGN METHOD WILL FIRST IDENTIFY LOW-THRUST PERIODIC ORBITS WHOSE MANIFOLDS PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE DESIRED REGIONS OF SPACE. NEXT  THE METHOD WILL CALCULATE THE MANIFOLDS WHICH PROVIDE THE PREFERRED TRAJECTORY CHARACTERISTICS AT THE LOWEST COST. THE RESULT OF THIS DETERMINATION WILL BE USED AS AN INITIAL GUESS IN AN OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUE. FINALLY  THE RESULTING SOLUTION WILL BE TESTED IN A HIGHER FIDELITY MODEL. THIS ENTIRE PROCESS WILL BE MADE AS AUTONOMOUS AS POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR EASE OF USE BY MISSION DESIGNERS. THE IMPROVED INITIAL GUESSES GENERATED BY THIS METHOD WILL PRODUCE SUPERIOR LOCALLY OPTIMAL TRAJECTORIES  WHICH COULD ENTAIL FUEL OR TIME SAVINGS FOR SPACECRAFT. THEREFORE  MISSION DESIGN STRATEGIES PRODUCED BY THIS STUDY COULD YIELD INNOVATIVE TRAJECTORIES THAT WOULD REDUCE MISSION COST AND INCREASE SCIENTIFIC RETURN.

THE FOLLOWING SECONDARY OBJECTIVES WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTRAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH. THE FIRST RESEARCH OBJECTIVE IS TO FORMULATE A REACHABILITY SUBSPACE SURFACE POINT SOLUTION OPTIMAL CONTROL PROBLEM STATEMENT USING CONTINUATION METHODS. CONTINUATION METHODS TAKE THE CONDITIONS OF OPTIMALITY AND EXPLORE POINT SOLUTIONS ON THE MANIFOLD ENFORCING DYNAMICS  INITIAL CONDITIONS  AND FIRST ORDER CONDITIONS OF OPTIMALITY. THE SECOND RESEARCH OBJECTIVE IS TO INVESTIGATE NOVEL METHODS TO FRAME THE REACHABILITY SUBSPACE COMPUTATION PROBLEM AS A DISTRIBUTED CONTROL PROBLEM WITH INDEPENDENT POINT SOLUTION AGENTS. THE PROPOSED APPROACH USES DISTRIBUTED CONTROL METHODS BY TREATING EACH POINT SOLUTION AS A DISTRIBUTED AGENT AND SOLVING THE SURFACE COVERAGE PROBLEM. THE FINAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVE IS TO EXTEND EXISTING DISTRIBUTED UNIFORM COVERAGE CONTROL POLICIES TO COMPUTE REACHABILITY SUBSPACES IN A COMPUTATIONALLY TRACTABLE MANNER. AS MANNED EXPLORATION MISSIONS TAKE HUMANS DEEPER INTO SPACE  THERE IS AN INCREASED RELIANCE ON AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS TO ASSIST IN THE OPERATION OF SPACECRAFT AND DEEP SPACE OPERATIONS AS A WHOLE.

DEVISE CONTROL AND PLANNING ALGORITHMS THAT ALLOW FREE-FLYERS TO NAVIGATE ACROSS COMPLEX SPACE STRUCTURES AND GRASP AND MANIPULATE PAYLOADS WITH ADHESION-BASED APPENDAGES. 3. VALIDATE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR MANIPULATION TASKS ON A STATE-OF-THE-ART TEST BED AT STANFORD EMULATING THE MOTION OF SPHERES AND FUTURE ASTROBEES IN ZERO GRAVITY. OUR TECHNICAL APPROACH IS BASED ON GECKO-INSPIRED  CONTROLLABLE ADHESIVES THAT ARE NON-STICKY IN THE DEFAULT STATE AND ADHERE ONLY WHEN LOADED IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION. RESEARCH FROM THE INVESTIGATORS HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SUCH ADHESIVES SCALE TO LARGE LOADS  FUNCTION IN VACUUM AND OVER A WIDE RANGE OF TEMPERATURES  AND PERFORM WELL UNDER COLLISIONS IN A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS INCLUDING CLIMBING ROBOTS  HUMAN CLIMBING  AND PERCHING MICRO-AIR VEHICLES. IN THE PROPOSED EFFORT WE WILL DESIGN APPENDAGES WITH SPECIALIZED GRIPPERS AND WRISTS THAT LEVERAGE SUCH ADHESIVES. THE WRISTS WILL BECOME FREELY PIVOTING IF AN OVERLOAD TORQUE IS APPLIED (E.G.  IN CASE OF A COLLISION). WRISTS AND GRIPPERS  WITHOUT A FREE-FLYER  COULD ALSO BE USED BY HUMANS WHO WANT TO ATTACH CAMERAS  SENSORS OR OTHER DEVICES TO FLAT OR CURVED SURFACES. FREE-FLYERS WITH ADHESION WILL REQUIRE NOVEL ALGORITHMS FOR PLANNING AND CONTROL THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COUPLED DYNAMICS OF THE FREE-FLYER AND THOSE OF THE END EFFECTOR  AND ALLOW THE APPENDAGES TO RELIABLY ENGAGE OR RELEASE PAYLOADS.

HOWEVER  A PLATFORM WITHOUT MANIPULATION ABILITIES IS RESTRICTED TO TASKS WHERE ITS ROLE CONSISTS OF DELIVERING SENSORS TO A DESIRED LOCATION. THE ENABLING CAPABILITIES FOR SUCH TASKS COMPRISE LOCALIZATION AND NAVIGATION  BOTH WELL-STUDIED IN THE CONTEXT OF AFFS. HOWEVER  ADDING THE CAPABILITY TO PHYSICALLY INTERACT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH MANIPULATION COULD GREATLY INCREASE AFF'S REACH  LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY.

ONE OF THE KEY PROBLEMS FOR MANIPULATION ON AN AFF IS ACHIEVING DEXTERITY IN A SMALL PACKAGE. HIGH CONFIGURABILITY THROUGH SEQUENCES OF TRADITIONAL ONE-DOF JOINTS DRIVEN BY CO-LOCATED MOTORS REQUIRES MULTIPLE SEGMENTS IN A KINEMATIC CHAIN. WE WILL DEVELOP MULTI-DOF JOINTS DRIVEN BY ELASTIC TENDONS AND STABILIZED BY LIGAMENTS  AIMING FOR HIGH FLEXIBILITY WITH AS FEW AS TWO SEGMENTS IN A KINEMATIC CHAIN. * UNDERACTUATION AND PASSIVE COMPLIANCE THROUGH HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOFT SYNERGIES IN HAND MOVEMENT. PASSIVELY COMPLIANT UNDERACTUATION METHODS FOR DEXTEROUS ROBOT HANDS  KNOWN AS \"SOFT SYNERGIES\"  HAVE MULTIPLE ADVANTAGES FOR AFFS. USING FEWER MOTORS THAN DOFS LEADS TO COMPACT  LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGNS; PASSIVE COMPLIANCE CAN HELP REGULATE THE FORCES APPLIED TO THE ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT COMPLEX HARDWARE FOR CLOSED-LOOP FORCE CONTROL. WE WILL COMBINE MULTIPLE SOFT SYNERGIES IN A SINGLE END-EFFECTOR DESIGN  AIMING TO ACHIEVE THE VERSATILITY NEEDED FOR MULTIPLE MANIPULATION TASKS. * HARDWARE-AWARE SUPERVISORY CONTROL METHODS ABLE TO QUANTIFY ROBUSTNESS TO EXECUTION ERRORS. PASSIVE COMPLIANCE DURING GRASPING CAN INCREASE ROBUSTNESS TO ERRORS DURING THE EXECUTION  FOR EXAMPLE BY INCREASING THE \"CAPTURE REGION\" FOR A TARGET OBJECT WHILE GRASPING. A SUPERVISORY CONTROL AWARE OF THE ERROR-CORRECTING ABILITY OF THE HARDWARE CAN ANALYZE THE TASK AS IT IS BEING EXECUTED AND CALL FOR HUMAN ASSISTANCE ONLY WHEN NEEDED. WE POSIT THAT A TIGHTER INTEGRATION BETWEEN HARDWARE DESIGN AND SUPERVISORY CONTROL METHODS WILL REDUCE THE NEED FOR OPERATOR INTERVENTIONS AND INCREASE OVERALL ROBUSTNESS.

AISS PERFORMANCE TO BE INVESTIGATED INCLUDE (1) EVALUATION OF THE IMMERSION FLUID FILLINGPATTERNS FOR THREE CANDIDATE AISS DOME GEOMETRIES  (2) EVALUATION OF AN AUTOMATED SUBSYSTEM TO FILL THE AISS DOMES WITH IMMERSION FLUID  (3) EVALUATION OF AN AUTOMATED SUBSYSTEM TO DETECT COMPLETE FILLING OF THE AISS DOME AND TURN OFF THE FILLING PUMP AND VALVES (4) EVALUATION OF THE EMPTYING OF THE AISS DURING PARTIAL GRAVITY  AND (5) EVALUATION OF THE REGULATION OF AISS PRESSURE WHEN FULLYFILLED. THIS PROCEDURE WILL BE CONDUCTED DURING A SUBORBITAL FLIGHT SO THAT FLUID BEHAVIOR AT A LOWER  MORE STABLE  AISS DOME FILLING RATE NOT POSSIBLE DURING PARABOLIC FLIGHT CAN BE EXAMINED ALONG WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE TASKS. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS SUBORBITALEVALUATION WILL RESULT IN THE FINAL DOME DESIGN SELECTION AND REVISION OF THE AISS CONTROL SYSTEM NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY CREATE AN AISS FLIGHT PROTOTYPE (TRL 6).

ON MOST ASTEROIDS  INCLUDING THE TARGETS OF NASAS UNMANNED AND EVENTUAL MANNED EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES  THE REGOLITH IS VERY LOOSELY BOUND BY INTERPARTICLE SURFACE FORCES AND VERY WEAK GRAVITY. THE BEHAVIOR OF THE REGOLITH IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT THAN IN TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS. ANCHORING EQUIPMENT TO THE SURFACE  AVOIDING DUST HAZARDS  COLLECTING SAMPLES  AND PERFORMING OTHER EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ON AND WITH THE SURFACE REQUIRE UNDERSTANDING THE RESPONSE OF REGOLITH PARTICLES TO A WIDE RANGE OF DISTURBANCES AND PERTURBATIONS IN THIS UNUSUAL ENVIRONMENT. THE PHYSICS OF REGOLITH IMPACTS IN MICROGRAVITY EXPERIMENT(PRIME) WAS DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE EXPERIMENTAL DATA ON THE BEHAVIOR OF ASTEROIDAL REGOLITH IN NEAR ZERO GRAVITY CONDITIONS. PRIMES MAIN FOCUS HAS CENTERED ON LOW VELOCITY COLLISIONS IN MICROGRAVITY AND HAS ENABLED THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EJECTA MASS AND VELOCITY PRODUCED DUE TO THESE LOW ENERGY IMPACTS.

A VEXING PROBLEM OF EXPERIMENTS WITH REGOLITH IN MICROGRAVITY IS IT MAKES A TERRIBLE MESS.

FURTHERMORE  NITRIDE BASED ELECTRONICS AND OPTOELECTRONICS ARE DEMONSTRATED TO OPERATE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES  400 C AND ARE THE BASIS FOR HIGH POWER  HIGH TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS. THEY ALSO SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A RAPIDLY GROWING WHITE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE LED MARKET  WITH WELL ESTABLISHED ROADMAPS FOR COST REDUCTION AND MANUFACTURABILITY. THE FOLLOWING KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPOSED SOLAR CELL ALLOW HIGH EFFICIENCY AND HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION.   A TWO JUNCTION INGAN BASED TANDEM SOLAR CELL STRUCTURE TO EXCEED THE NASA TARGET SOLAR CELL EFFICIENCY GOALS  25 OPERATING AT OR NEAR THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF THE SOLAR THERMAL SYSTEM.  ADVANCED DEVICE STRUCTURES AND FABRICATION METHODS SUITABLE FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION SUCH AS HIGH THERMAL STABILITY METAL CONTACT METALLURGY WITH LOW SPECIFIC CONTACT RESISTANCE AND ALL NITRIDE BASED SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS.  NOVEL HETEROSTRUCTURE CARRIER SELECTIVE CONTACT STRUCTURES IN THE ABSORBER LAYER TO INCREASE OPEN CIRCUIT VOLTAGE AND RELAX THE DOPING REQUIREMENTS IN THE PHOTOACTIVE REGIONS.  THERMIONIC ESCAPE FROM  SHALLOW  QUANTUM WELLS QWS THAT ACHIEVES HIGH EFFICIENCY THROUGH INCREASED PHOTOCARRIER COLLECTION AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES.  A FLEXIBLE DEVICE TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW FOR CONFORMAL MOUNTING OF THE SOLAR CELL DEVICE TO THE TARGET SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGY  AND REDUCE SUBSTRATE AND RELATED MATERIAL COSTS.  ADVANTAGES THE PROPOSED III NITRIDE SOLAR CELL HAS NUMEROUS ADVANTAGES IF INTEGRATING INTO A CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER CSP SYSTEM  RELATING TO ITS PERFORMANCE  COST  SCALABILITY AND FEASIBILITY. FOR EXAMPLE  THE PROPOSED INGAN SOLAR CELL ALLOWS A SYSTEM WITH HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND LOWER COSTS THAN ANY OTHER SOLAR BASED ELECTRICITY SYSTEM  WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ALLOWING A LARGE FRACTION OF DISPATCHABLE ELECTRICITY  THUS ADDRESSING THE MAJOR PRESENT DRAWBACK WITH PV SYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE  THROUGH THE EXISTING LED INDUSTRY  THE DEVICES HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED RELIABILITY AND SCALABILITY. FINALLY  THE ABILITY TO MAKE HIGH PERFORMANCE HIGHER BANDGAP INGAN SOLAR CELLS HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED. THESE ADVANTAGES ARE SUMMARIZED IN  TABLE I OF THE FULL PROPOSAL.  IMPACTS AND INFUSION THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH EFFICIENCY INGAN SOLAR CELL ENABLES A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IN THE ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY GENERATE POWER WITHOUT CONCERNS OF OPERATIONAL TEMPERATURES  WHICH IS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS. THE KEY ASPECTS OF THE APPROACH ARE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF THE III NITRIDE MATERIALS SYSTEMS  WHICH EXCLUSIVELY AMONG COMMERCIAL SEMICONDUCTORS ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION. FURTHER  WE CAPITALIZE ON THE RAPID GROWTH INDUSTRIES BASED ON THE III NITRIDES SUCH AS SOLID STATE LIGHTING  WHICH DRIVES BOTH TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND REDUCED COSTS. A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO VARIOUS NASA MISSIONS AS POWER GENERATION IS CRITICAL TO SPACE TECHNOLOGY  ESPECIALLY FOR SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE SMD MISSIONS FOCUSED ON DESTINATIONS CLOSER TO THE SUN.

IN THE ABOVE CONTEXT  THIS WORK WILL AIM TO PROVIDE METHODS WITH STRONG PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES REGARDING THE QUALITY AND ROBUSTNESS OF TRAJECTORIES FOR TENSEGRITY STRUCTURES. THIS EFFORT WILL PROGRESS THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN PLANNING FOR TENSEGRITIES BY PROVIDING PLANNERS THAT REASON ABOUT COMPLEX CONTACTS FOR SOFT ROBOTICS PLATFORMS. THESE TECHNIQUES SHOULD ALSO BE PRACTICAL AND COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT AND THEY WILL BE EVALUATED ON REAL TENSEGRITY PLATFORMS CONSIDERED AS POSSIBLE PLANETARY EXPLORATION PROBES. CLASSICAL LOCOMOTION AND MANIPULATION SYSTEMS EMPLOY LEGS  HANDS OR WHEELS  BUT HAVE LIMITED DEFORMATION. TENSEGRITY IS A GOOD CANDIDATE TO CONSTRUCT ROBOTS WITH ARBITRARY FORMS THAT ADAPT EFFICIENTLY TO HIGHLY UNSTRUCTURED AND CLUTTERED ENVIRONMENTS. TENSEGRITY ROBOTS ARE LIGHTWEIGHT  IMPACT TOLERANT AND OFFER UNIQUE MODES OF LOCOMOTION  AS THEY CAN ROLL  CRAWL OR GALLOP DEPENDING ON CONSTRUCTION AND NEED. THEY ARE ESPECIALLY WELL SUITED FOR TASKS THAT REQUIRE LOW-WEIGHT  ENERGY EFFICIENT PLATFORMS  AS THEY ARE TYPICALLY MADE OF TUBES/RODS AND CABLES/ELASTIC LINES. THE USE OF ELASTIC TENSILE COMPONENTS AND DYNAMICAL GAITS ENABLES EFFICIENT MOVEMENT. THE ABOVE PROPERTIES MAKE TENSEGRITY STRUCTURES APPROPRIATE FOR SPACE APPLICATION  AS THEY INTRODUCE SMALL WEIGHT OVERHEAD RELATIVE TO THE SCIENCE PAYLOAD UPON ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY  ACT AS AIR-BAGS UPON LANDING PROTECTING THE KEY EQUIPMENT AND ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SURFACE MOBILITY AND MANIPULATION CAPABILITIES. THIS IMPLIES THAT FUTURE MISSIONS CAN BE CHEAPER AND CAN UTILIZE NEW WAYS OF INTERACTING WITH PLANETARY SURFACES. DESPITE THEIR BENEFITS  THE CONTROL OF TENSEGRITY ROBOTS IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THE INFINITE DIMENSIONALITY AND DEPENDENCE ON NON-LINEAR DYNAMICS. IN PARTICULAR  TWO KEY ASPECTS OF TENSEGRITY STRUCTURES MAKE THEM HARD TO OPERATE USING CLASSICAL CONTROL METHODOLOGIES: (I) A FORCE APPLIED ON A TENSEGRITY STRUCTURE CAUSES NON-LINEAR RESPONSES AND (II) OSCILLATORY BEHAVIORS ARISE FROM INTERACTIONS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE ISSUES HAVE LIMITED CURRENT PATH PLANNING TO SOLUTIONS TO THE GENERATION OF QUASI-STATIC PATHS. EXISTING SOLUTIONS EITHER DEAL WITH GATE GENERATION AND DO NOT ADDRESS GLOBAL PATH PLANNING  OR ONLY PROVIDE QUASI-STATIC COLLISION-FREE PATHS.

FROM A SPACE EXPLORATION PERSPECTIVE  CYANOBACTERIA SUCH AS SYNECHOCYSTIS SP. PCC 6803  HAVE THE DESIRABLE CAPACITY TO CAPTURE AND STORE ENERGY THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS (CONSUMING CO2 AND REGENERATING O2) AND TO THRIVE UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS INCLUDING CO2-RICH ATMOSPHERES. FURTHERMORE  SYNECHOCYSTIS HAS GREAT METABOLIC POTENTIAL AND HAS BEEN ENGINEERED TO PRODUCE A VARIETY OF USEFUL CHEMICALS FROM CO2 WITH HIGH EFFICIENCIES.

MANUFACTURED PROTEIN FIBERS CAN BE EASILY HARVESTED AND SPUN USING LIMITED RESOURCES  WITHOUT COMPLICATED PURIFICATION STEPS TO REMOVE UNDESIRABLE BYPRODUCTS AS NEEDED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD AND THERAPEUTICS. METHODS: CURRENT BIOSYNTHESIS OF PROTEIN-BASED MATERIALS IS LIMITED TO THE RECOMBINANT PRODUCTION OF A FEW SPIDER SILK AND ELASTOMERIC PROTEINS WHICH HAVE SO FAR FAILED TO REPLICATE THE HIGH MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE OF THEIR NATURAL COUNTERPARTS. THESE FAILURES ARE DUE LARGELY TO THE INABILITY TO SYNTHESIZE ULTRAHIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT PROTEINS (UHMWS) WITH CONTROLLED ORDERS OF REPEATING SUBUNITS. WE PROPOSE TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS BY DEVELOPING A UNIQUE PROTEIN ASSEMBLY STRATEGY. CYANOBACTERIA WILL BE ENGINEERED TO SYNTHESIZE AND SECRET FUNCTIONALIZED PROTEIN MONOMERS. THE SECRETED MONOMERS WILL THEN SELF-LIGATE IN DEFINED ORDERS TO FORM UHMW POLYMERS AND COPOLYMERS  WHICH WILL PRECIPITATE FROM THE MEDIA AND CAN BE EASILY HARVESTED FOR DOWNSTREAM PROCESSING.

ONE SUCH TECHNOLOGY THE UTILIZATION OF LUNAR REGOLITH FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF PARTS AND STRUCTURES  IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN REDUCING MISSION COST  RISK  AND COMPLEXITY. CURRENT RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC FOCUSES ON 3D PRINTING TECHNIQUES USING REGOLITH AND OTHER ADVANCED FABRICATION METHODS. IN ORDER TO CREATE STRONG  RELIABLE PARTS  THE MINERAL COMPOSITION AND GRANULAR SIZE OF THE REGOLITH MUST BE TIGHTLY CONTROLLED. THOUGH MANY TERRESTRIAL DEVICES EXIST FOR SORTING GRANULAR MATERIALS BY SIZE AND MATERIAL  LIKE SIEVES AND CENTRIFUGES  MANY OF THESE ARE LARGE  COMPLEX  OR INEFFECTIVE IN THE LOW GRAVITY  HIGHLY ELECTRICAL LUNAR ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE  THE LUNAR SURFACE IS HIGHLY ELECTRICALLY CHARGED  POSING RISKS OF DISCHARGE AND SIGNIFICANT CLUMPING IN MANY REGOLITH HANDLING DEVICES. THEREFORE  A NOVEL DEVICE FOR SIZE BENEFICIATION OF LUNAR GRAINS WHICH REMOVES OR UTILIZES THIS CHARGE WILL BE NECESSARY TO ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESOURCE UTILIZATION TECHNOLOGIES AND IMPROVE FUTURE EXPLORATION MISSIONS. TRIBOCHARGING SHOWS GREAT PROMISE AS A METHOD FOR BOTH SIZE BENEFICIATION AND MINERAL SEPARATION  AND I PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A DEVICE USING THIS PHENOMENON FOR LUNAR REGOLITH. WHEN A GRANULAR MIXTURE IS SHAKEN  THE TRIBOELECTRIC EFFECT CAUSES CHARGE TO ACCUMULATE ON PARTICULAR MINERALS IN THE MIXTURE IN A PREDICTABLE WAY. A FAR LESS UNDERSTOOD ASPECT OF THE TRIBOELECTRIC EFFECT IS THE TENDENCY FOR NEGATIVE CHARGE TO ALSO ACCUMULATE ON SMALLER GRAINS  EVEN WHEN THE MIXTURE IS COMPOSED OF ONLY ONE INSULATING MATERIAL. WHILE MINERAL SEPARATION USING TRIBOCHARGING HAS BEEN  DEMONSTRATED SUCCESSFULLY  NO SPACE READY DEVICE YET EXISTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SIZE DEPENDENT CHARGING EFFECT. I WILL DESIGN  BUILD  AND TEST SUCH A DEVICE. I WILL FIRST DEVELOP AN UNDERLYING THEORY FOR SAME MATERIAL  SIZE DEPENDENT TRIBOCHARGING THROUGH EXPERIMENTS. THIS THEORY WILL BE APPLIED TO LUNAR REGOLITH  A COMPLEX AND DISPERSE MIXTURE OF MANY MATERIALS AND SIZES. THE DEVICE WILL USE ELECTROSTATIC SEPARATION OF TRIBOCHARGED GRAINS TO SORT THE MATERIAL WITH MINIMAL MOVING PARTS OR CONTACT WITH THE GRAINS. DUE TO THE HIGHLY ADHESIVE AND ABRASIVE NATURE OF LUNAR REGOLITH  THIS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE LIFESPAN OF THE DEVICE AND REDUCES ITS COMPLEXITY RELATIVE TO OTHER GRAIN SEPARATION CONCEPTS. IN ADDITION  THE EXISTING CHARGE ON LUNAR GRAINS REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OTHER EXISTING SEPARATION METHODS  BUT IS A BOON TO AN ELECTROSTATIC SEPARATION DEVICE. THE RESULTS OF MY EXPERIMENTS WILL REVEAL THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS PRE AND POST TREATMENT METHODS ON TRIBOCHARGING OF REGOLITH  WHICH I CAN USE TO INCREASE THE DEGREE OF SIZE SEPARATION AND REMOVE THE CHARGE AFTER SEPARATION. THEREFORE  THE DEVICE WOULD TAKE RAW CHARGED REGOLITH AS INPUT  AND PRODUCE ELECTRICALLY NEUTRAL GRAINS SORTED BY MINERAL AND OR SIZE  DEPENDING ON THE DESIRED MODE OF OPERATION. ELECTROSTATIC SIZE BENEFICIATION USING TRIBOCHARGING IS STILL A VERY YOUNG FIELD  BUT SHOWS INCREDIBLE PROMISE FOR LOW COMPLEXITY REGOLITH SEPARATION. THE LACK OF  UNDERSTANDING OF THIS EFFECT HAS SEVERELY LIMITED ITS USE IN GRAIN SORTING APPLICATIONS TO DATE. GIVEN THE RECENT PUSH FOR BETTER IN SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION  AND THE ADVANCEMENTS IN 3D PRINTING TECHNOLOGIES  THERE IS A RAPIDLY GROWING NEED FOR A DEVICE TO CONVERT REGOLITH INTO A USABLE RAW MATERIAL.

THIS COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT WILL INCORPORATE ADVANCED MATERIALS  THERMOELECTRIC GENERATORS  AND A POSSIBLE COOLING SYSTEM. THE TESTING OF THE POWER EXTRACTION MODULE WILL OCCUR IN A VACCUM ENVIRONMENT DOWNSTREAM OF AN ION SOURCE SUCH AS AN EP WHERE I WILL MEASURE THE POWER OUTPUT AND EFFICIENCY OF THIS MODULE. THE NEXT BRIEF PORTION WILL DETERMINE IF NEUTRALLY CHARGED BEAMS ARE SAFER THAN EP FOR INTERACTING WITH THE ASTEROID SURFACE AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT AND CLEAR ARGUMENT FOR NEUTRAL BEAMS. THIS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN A VACCUM ENVIRONMENT THAT USES REGOLITH SIMULANT PILES TO MIMIC THE SURFACE OF AN ASTEROID.

THE DESIGN AND TESTING PORTIONS WILL INCORPORATE THERMAL AND PLASMA ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING THE REQUISITE TORQUE NEEDED TO DESPIN AN ASTEROID.

THE BETTER THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW NANO AND BULK MATERIALS WORK TOGETHER THE MORE WE CAN TAILOR THEIR PROPERTIES TO OPTIMIZE THEIR PERFORMANCE. THERE IS A CONSTANT SEARCH FOR LIGHTWEIGHT  CHEMICALLY STABLE  AND ALLY THERMALLY ELECTRICALLY ROBUST MATERIALS THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE HARSH ENVIRONMENTS ENCOUNTERED BY AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY. IN THIS PROPOSAL A RESEARCH INITIATIVE IS PRESENTED THAT FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTIGATION OF COAXIAL GRAPHENE ON COPPER WIRES FOR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS. A CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THESE GRAPHENE COATED WIRES WILL BE PERFORMED. THERMAL PROPERTIES  ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES  AND CORROSION RESISTANCE WILL ALSO BE EXPLORED. MANY THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE REGARDING THE USE OF GRAPHENE ON BULK MATERIALS  HOWEVER MINIMAL EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD HAS BEEN DONE. CURRENTLY  THERE IS A DEARTH OF EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF THESE PREDICTIONS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES EXPERIMENTS THAT WILL PREDICT THE MATERIALS BEHAVIOR UNDER HARSH ENVIRONMENTS THAT AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY ENCOUNTERS. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST A RANGE OF WIRE DIAMETERS TO DETERMINE HOW THIN THE WIRE CAN BE FOR GRAPHENE GROWTH  YET STILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS.

MY INVESTIGATION WILL BEGIN WITH THE SPECIAL CASE OF TWO OBJECTS APPROACHING EACH OTHER ON A FRICTIONLESS PLANE. I WILL CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS TRACKING PERMANENT MAGNETS APPROACHING EACH OTHER ON AN AIR TABLE. AFTER INVESTIGATING THE CASE OF STATIC MAGNETIC FIELDS  I WILL CREATE TEST PLATFORMS TO PRODUCE VARIABLE FIELDS DURING THEIR APPROACH. THESE ROBOTS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SIMPLE PERMANENT MAGNETS AND OTHER OFF-THE-SHELF PARTS.  2. NEXT I WILL SELECT SENSORS SO THAT THE ROBOTS CAN CHARACTERIZE THE STATE OF THEIR APPROACH. THESE WILL BE PROVEN  HIGH-TRL SOLUTIONS  INTEGRATED WITH MY LOW-TRL WORK TO CREATE A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SUITABLE FOR TESTING IN A LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT.

THE SPACE PROPULSION LAB AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IS DEVELOPING ELECTROSPRAY ION THRUSTERS FOR SMALL SATELLITES. CURRENT WORK IS FOCUSED ON THE CHARACTERIZATION OF ION BEAMS PRODUCED BY VARIOUS IONIC LIQUIDS. DETERMINING THE BEST ELECTROSPRAY PROPELLANTS AND WHAT PROPERTIES DRIVE THEIR PERFORMANCE IS THE FOCUS OF THE PROPOSED WORK. ADDITIONAL AREAS OF RESEARCH INCLUDE FULLY CHARACTERIZING ILIS  INCREASING THE PREDICTABILITY OF ION BEAM PROPERTIES BASED ON IONIC LIQUID COMPOSITION  AND DETERMINING THE LIMITATIONS OF ILIS FOR FOCUSED ION BEAM AND SPACECRAFT PROPULSION APPLICATIONS. UNDERSTANDING AND PREDICTING ILIS BEAM PROPERTIES ALLOWS FOR ITS APPLICATION TO SMALL SATELLITES REQUIRING PRECISE POSITION CONTROL AS WELL AS ION BEAM LITHOGRAPHY.  IONIC LIQUIDS  OR MOLTEN SALTS  ARE LIQUIDS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE COMPOSED OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IONS. ILIS WORKS BY USING AN ELECTRIC FIELD TO STRESS THE LIQUID SURFACE  EXTRACT IONS FROM THE LIQUID  AND ACCELERATE THE IONS TO HIGH VELOCITIES. A SINGLE ION SOURCE CONSISTS OF A SHARP TIP COATED WITH IONIC LIQUID  PLACED CLOSE TO A METAL EXTRACTION PLATE WITH A HOLE IN IT TO LET THE IONS PASS THROUGH. AN ARRAY OF ILIS TIPS CAN BE USED AS AN ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTER. ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS HAVE MANY ADVANTAGES OVER PLASMA THRUSTERS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE IS THAT ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS ARE VERY COMPACT AND CAN BE USED ON SMALL SATELLITES. PLASMA THRUSTERS ARE DIFFICULT TO SCALE DOWN FOR USE ON SMALL SPACECRAFT BECAUSE THE PLASMA DENSITY MUST BE INCREASED  WHICH GREATLY DECREASES THE LIFETIME OF THE THRUSTER.  BECAUSE OF THIS  ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE ATTITUDE AND POSITION CONTROL OF SMALL SPACECRAFT.  LESS THAN TEN IONIC LIQUIDS  OUT OF THOUSANDS  HAVE BEEN TESTED AS PROPELLANTS FOR ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS. IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THE BEST IONIC LIQUIDS FOR ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED IN ILIS OR HAVE NOT YET BEEN SYNTHESIZED. FOR EXAMPLE  A MAJOR SOURCE OF INEFFICIENCY COMES FROM NON-UNIFORM BEAM COMPOSITION. DETERMINING HOW LIQUID COMPOSITION AFFECTS THIS IS THE FOCUS OF CURRENT WORK. HOWEVER  BEAM COMPOSITION IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF FINDING THE BEST PROPELLANTS. DETERMINING HOW BULK LIQUID PROPERTIES LIKE CONDUCTIVITY  SURFACE TENSION  AND VISCOSITY AFFECT PERFORMANCE IS ANOTHER AREA OF STUDY. ADDITIONALLY  IT IS CRITICAL TO INVESTIGATE HOW LIQUID PROPERTIES AFFECT FUNDAMENTAL ILIS PROCESSES: ION EVAPORATION  MICROFLUIDICS  AND INTERFACE INTERACTIONS. A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW LIQUID PROPERTIES CONTROL PERFORMANCE WILL ENABLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGHLY EFFICIENT  VARIABLE THRUST ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS THAT CAN BE USED AS A MULTIPURPOSE PROPULSION SYSTEM. IT ALSO WILL ENABLE THE USE OF ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS FOR PRECISION DRAG-FREE SPACEFLIGHT  POSSIBLY LIKE THAT REQUIRED BY THE LASER INTERFEROMETER SPACE ANTENNA (LISA).  ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS AND ILIS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DRASTICALLY IMPROVE SMALL SPACECRAFT PROPULSIVE CAPABILITIES AND FOCUSED ION BEAM TECHNOLOGIES. ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS COULD ENABLE LOW-COST  SMALL SPACECRAFT TO ACCOMPLISH THE SCIENTIFIC GOALS OF LARGE  COSTLY PLATFORMS  WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY VALUABLE TO SOCIETY. ILIS FOCUSED ION BEAM DEPOSITION AND ETCHING COULD VASTLY IMPROVE AND EXPAND THE POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES BY OFFERING THOUSANDS OF NEW OPTIONS FOR ION BEAM CONSTITUENTS.

NECESSARY SYSTEM ELECTRONICS  SENSITIVE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND ESPECIALLY ASTRONAUTS ONBOARD THE SPACECRAFT MUST OPERATE WITHIN A SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE WINDOW OR THE MISSION WILL FAIL. HOWEVER  THE TENDENCY OF A SPACECRAFT'S TEMPERATURE IS TO INCREASE. THE SUN AND THE EARTH RADIATE HEAT THAT IS ABSORBED INTO THESPACECRAFT WHILE ON BOARD ELECTRONICS AND PERSONNEL GENERATE HEAT INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT. ON EARTH  THIS EXCESS HEAT WOULD NORMALLY BE REMOVED BY AIR AROUND THE SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER  THE SPACECRAFT IS IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE. AS SUCH  THE HEAT MUST ULTIMATELY BE EMITTED AWAY FROM THE SPACECRAFT AS RADIATION. COMPONENTS DESIGNED TO EMIT THIS EXCESS HEAT ARE CALLED RADIATORS AND ARE A VITAL PART OF THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF ANY SPACECRAFT. HOWEVER  BECAUSE THE HEAT LOAD ON A SYSTEM VARIES WITH ORBIT  RADIATORS ARE DESIGNED FOR A WORST CASE HEATING SCENARIO. AS SUCH  ANY HEATING CONFIGURATION OUTSIDE OF THE DESIGNED HEATING SCENARIO CAUSES THE RADIATOR TO BEHAVE IN AN UNDESIRABLE WAY  EMITTING MORE HEAT THAN DESIRED OR ABSORBING TOO MUCH HEAT FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. LIKEWISE  THESE RADIATORS ARE HEAVY  OFTEN COMPRISING 30 - 40 PERCENT OF TOTAL SPACECRAFT WEIGHT. A SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE SOLUTION  AS DISCUSSED IN THE THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ROADMAP  IS TO DEVELOP A LIGHTWEIGHT RADIATOR WHICH IS ABLE TO MANIPULATE ITS HEAT REJECTION RATE IN REAL TIME.  THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSES A LIGHT WEIGHT  VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY BE UTILIZED IN MANY APPLICATIONS  INCLUDING THAT OF A DEEP SPACE RADIATOR. A THIN  MIRROR FINISH ALUMINUM FOIL IS FOLDED INTO A SIMPLE  ORIGAMI INSPIRED V GROOVE PATTERN. THIS PATTERN ALLOWS FOR THE FOIL TO BE COMPRESSED  SUCH THAT THE V GROOVES ARE VERY STEEP AND TIGHTLY COMPACTED  OR STRETCHED UNTIL IT RESEMBLES A FLAT SHEET.  AS THE FOIL IS COMPRESSED  THE AMOUNT OF HEAT RADIATED INTO SPACE OR THE AMOUNT OF HEAT ABSORBED IS GREATLY INCREASED. WHEN PULLED FLAT  THE FOIL WILL EMIT AND ABSORB VERY LITTLE RADIATION. THIS VARIABLE HEAT REJECTION CAPABILITY IS USEFUL FOR BOTH RADIATOR AND HEAT SHIELD APPLICATIONS. AS A RADIATOR  THE FOIL WILL GIVE THE USER CONTROL OF HOW MUCH HEAT IS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE SYSTEM. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY RADIATOR WEIGHT WHILE DELIVERING OPTIMUM HEAT REJECTION PERFORMANCE FOR THE ENTIRE MISSION DURATION. LIKEWISE  THESE FOILS MAY BE USED AS HEAT SHIELDS  PLACED OVER COMPONENTS SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS  SUCH AS CRYOGENIC FLUID TANKS.  WHEN ILLUMINATED BY THE SUN  THE SHIELD CAN ASSUME A FLAT STATE  REFLECTING 98 PERCENT OF THE SUN'S ENERGY AWAY FROM THE SENSITIVE COMPONENT.  UPON ENTERING THE EARTH'S SHADOW  THE SHIELD WILL ASSUME A COMPRESSED STATE  EMITTING EXCESS HEAT ORIGINATING FROM THE SPACECRAFT INTO DEEP SPACE INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THIS HEAT ONTO THE CRYOGENIC FLUID TANK.PRELIMINARY WORK CHARACTERIZING THE BEHAVIOR OF V GROOVES WHEN EXPOSED TO RADIATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. HOWEVER  THE BULK OF THE WORK REMAINS. THE TOTAL HEAT REJECTED FROM A FOIL SAMPLE  ACCOUNTING FOR EMITTING SURFACE AREA  MUST BE CHARACTERIZED. LIKEWISE  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FOIL AND THE SURFACE IT IS PROTECTING MUST BE DETERMINED. NEXT  AN ACTUATION SYSTEM AND FIXATION COMPONENTS MUST BE DEVELOPED.

SATELLITES CONSTRUCTED IN SPACE WOULD NOT EXPERIENCE THESE DESIGN CONSTRAINTS  ALLOWING FOR LIGHTER  MORE CAPABLE SATELLITES. START TO FINISH CONSTRUCTION IN ORBIT IS NOT YET POSSIBLE  BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN ACHIEVE SOMETHING OF THE DESIRED EFFECT THROUGH RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN SATELLITE FORMATION FLYING AND AUTONOMOUS RENDEZVOUS AND DOCKING. IMAGINE EACH OF THE SATELLITE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS ARE THEMSELVES SATELLITES. ONCE THEY ARE LAUNCHED  THEY CAN RENDEZVOUS AND ASSEMBLE THEMSELVES INTO THE DESIRED SATELLITE SHAPE LIKE INTELLIGENT TINKER TOYS  WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF A FEW DIFFERENT TYPES OF IDENTICAL COMPONENTS. THE ASSEMBLED STRUCTURES WOULD HAVE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER A TRADITIONAL SATELLITE INCLUDING  INCREASED RELIABILITY DUE TO REDUNDANCY  LOWER COST  AND ABILITY TO RECONFIGURE. ALSO ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS WOULD HAVE TO SURVIVE LAUNCH LOADS  SO THE STRUCTURE CAN BE MUCH LIGHTER.IN CONTRAST WITH PRIOR WORK OF DESIGNING AND CONTROLLING A LARGE NUMBER OF IDENTICAL SATELLITES OR A SMALLER NUMBER OF HETEROGENEOUS FUNCTIONALITIES  THIS NSTRF PROJECT AIMS TO FILL THE GAP OF DEVELOPING BOTH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND GUIDANCE AND CONTROL ALGORITHMS OF AUTONOMOUSLY CONSTRUCTING A LARGE SPACE STRUCTURE OUT OF A PREDEFINED SET OF HETEROGENEOUS COMPONENT SATELLITES. IN PARTICULAR  NEW ALGORITHMS AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEEDED TO COMBINE RECONFIGURABLE FORMATION FLYING WITH RENDEZVOUS AND DOCKING ALGORITHMS THAT CAN DEAL WITH A LARGE NUMBER (100S-1000S) OF A FEW HETEROGENEOUS TYPES OF SATELLITES TO FORM A DESIRED THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPE IN LOW EARTH ORBIT. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH HURDLE IS OPTIMALLY ASSIGNING WHERE THE SATELLITES SHOULD GO. CURRENT PROBABILISTIC SWARM GUIDANCE ALGORITHMS ASSIGN A GOAL POSITION BASED ON A SET OF OPTIMAL TRANSPORT PROBLEMS  BUT CANNOT HANDLE HETEROGENEOUS SWARMS LIKE THE ONE PROPOSED. I PROPOSE TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM BY ADDING CONSTRAINTS ON WHICH COMPONENTS CAN ATTACH TO OTHER COMPONENTS  LIKE CONNECTORS CANNOT ATTACH TO CONNECTORS. WITH THE ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS  PROBABILISTIC SWARM GUIDANCE MAY BE ABLE TO ASSIGN POSITIONS. ONCE THE POSITIONS ARE ASSIGNED  AN OPTIMAL CONTROL ALGORITHM WILL GUIDE THE SATELLITES TO PREVENT COLLISIONS AND ENSURE MINIMAL FUEL CONSUMPTION. AFTER THE COMPONENTS KNOW WHERE TO GO  THEY WILL NEED TO DOCK TOGETHER TO FORM THE DESIRED RIGID STRUCTURE. TETHER DOCKS  WHICH REEL IN THE COMPONENT TRYING TO DOCK  ARE THE FIRST SELECTION BECAUSE THEY REDUCE THE NEED FOR COMPLEX PROXIMITY OPERATIONS. THIS REELING MAY CAUSE UNDESIRABLE MOTION IN THE CONSTRUCTED SATELLITE SO THE INTERACTIONS WILL NEED TO BE MODELLED THOROUGHLY. AS NEW COMPONENTS DOCK TO THE OVERALL STRUCTURE  THE AVAILABLE CONTROL POINTS INCREASE AND INERTIAL PROPERTIES OF THE SATELLITE CHANGE  WHICH CHANGES THE OPTIMAL CONTROL STRATEGY.

USING ACQUIRED DATA TO MODEL THE MAGNETO-HYDRO-DYNAMIC (MHD) ENVIRONMENT IN ADDITION TO THE THERMOCHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE OPERATION OF THE HIPEP PPT. PLASMA PLUME DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR PPT'S ARE WELL OUTLINED BY LITERATURE IN THE FIELD OF ELECTRIC PROPULSION  AND ARE EASILY ADAPTED TO THE HIPEP MICROTHRUSTER. PLUME CHARACTERIZATION WORK ON THE HIPEP THRUSTER HAS ALREADY BEGUN AT THE MISSOURI UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AS PART OF THE STUDENT APPLICANT'S DOCTORAL RESEARCH PROGRAM  AND THIS TYPE OF WORK COULD BE ENHANCED BY FURTHER TESTING AT A NASA CENTER SUCH AS THE MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER (MSFC) AND/OR NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC). PERFORMANCE CHARACTERIZATION OF A HIPEP THRUSTER AND TEFLON THRUSTER WILL BUILD OFF PREVIOUS RESEARCH FROM DSSP AND THE ELECTRIC PROPULSION COMMUNITY  RESPECTIVELY  THAT WOULD SERVE TO JUMP-START  OUTLINE  AND GUIDE THE APPROACH FOR THIS PROJECT.  PERFORMANCE CHARACTERIZATION WOULD ALSO GREATLY BENEFIT FROM TESTING AT MSFC AND/OR GRC DUE TO THE EXPERTISE OF RESEARCHERS AND QUALITY OF AVAILABLE HARDWARE.

THE PROPOSED WORK AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE PROMINENT SHORTCOMINGS VIA INVESTIGATION OF 1-D FIBER-REINFORCED COMPOSITE STRUTS THAT ARE COMPUTATIONALLY DESIGNED FOR INCREASED SPECIFIC STIFFNESS AND BUCKLING RESISTANCE AND 2-D ELEMENT POPULATIONS THAT HAVE TUNABLE AND DIRECTIONAL PROPERTIES THAT CAN RESIST TYPICAL CARBON FIBER-EPOXY MATRIX COMPOSITE LOADS.

OUR TEAM ANTICIPATES THAT THE FIRST PROTOTYPES WILL BE FLIGHT TESTED IN SPACE WITHIN THREE TO FOUR YEARS. ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION RELIES ON A WELL-KNOWN ELECTROHYDRODYNAMIC PHENOMENON WHEREBY A THIN FILM OF CONDUCTIVE FLUID IS SPONTANEOUSLY DEFORMED INTO ONE OR MANY SHARP CONE-LIKE PROTRUSIONS CALLED TAYLOR CONES. THESE CONES FORM WHEN THE LIQUID IS SUBJECTED TO VERY LARGE ELECTRIC FIELD STRENGTHS SUCH THAT THE MAXWELL FORCES OVERCOME THE RESTORING FORCE OF SURFACE TENSION. FOR LIQUID METAL PROPELLANTS  THE SURFACE TENSION IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LARGER THAN ORDINARY LIQUIDS WHICH IN TURN REQUIRES APPLICATION OF LARGE FIELD STRENGTHS.

THIS CHARACTERIZATION WILL INCLUDE GATHERING THRUST MEASUREMENTS  A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE PLASMA PLUME OF THE THRUSTER  CALCULATING EFFICIENCIES  A STUDY OF THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MULTIPLE DISCHARGE CHANNELS RUNNING AT ONE TIME  AND AN INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF MAGNETIC FIELD SHAPE ON THRUSTER PERFORMANCE. THE CHARACTERIZATION WILL OCCUR AT MULTIPLE POINTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE OPERATING ENVELOPE OF THE THRUSTER  RANGING FROM 2 KW TO OVER 200 KW OF DISCHARGE POWER. THE DISCHARGE POWER LEVELS OF THE X3 CAUSE UNIQUE FACILITY ISSUES THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED BY TESTING AT TWO DIFFERENT FACILITIES DURING THIS CHARACTERIZATION. THE LOW HALF OF THE PERFORMANCE ENVELOPE OF THE THRUSTER WILL BE INVESTIGATED INSIDE THE LARGE VACUUM TEST FACILITY AT PEPL. AT HIGHER POWER LEVELS  THE X3 WILL BE INVESTIGATED IN VACUUM FACILITY 5 (VF-5) AT NASA S GLENN RESEARCH CENTER. VF-5 OFFERS THE IDEAL FACILITY IN WHICH TO RUN THE X3 IN THE UPPER HALF OF ITS PERFORMANCE ENVELOPE. THIS HAS BEEN PLANNED SINCE THE GENESIS OF THE PROJECT  AND MUCH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED TO THE X3 WAS DESIGNED WITH TESTING AT VF-5 IN MIND. THE THRUST MEASUREMENTS WILL BE COLLECTED USING AN INVERTED-PENDULUM THRUST STAND. THRUST MEASUREMENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT METRIC ON THEIR OWN  BUT ALSO ARE USED TO CALCULATE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PARAMETERS INCLUDING ANODE SPECIFIC IMPULSE. THE ANALYSIS OF THE PLASMA PLUME WILL BE DONE WITH AN ARRAY OF PROBES  INCLUDING A FARADAY PROBE  A LANGMUIR PROBE  AN EXB PROBE  AND A RETARDING POTENTIAL ANALYZER. THE DATA FROM THESE PROBES ADDITIONALLY WILL BE USED TO CALCULATE A NUMBER OF THRUSTER EFFICIENCIES. THESE EFFICIENCIES ARE INDICATORS OF THRUSTER PERFORMANCE  AND WILL BE USED AS A COMPARATIVE TOOL ACROSS MULTIPLE OPERATING POINTS. THE WORK PROPOSED HERE IS IMPORTANT ON ITS OWN  BUT HAS FURTHER-REACHING IMPLICATIONS AS WELL. THE TWO BIGGEST TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WITH HALL THRUSTERS  AS IDENTIFIED BY NASA  ARE INCREASING DISCHARGE POWER AND INCREASING LIFETIME. THE X3 S MAIN CONTRIBUTION IS ITS POWER LEVEL  BUT WHAT IS PROPOSED HERE WITH IT WILL ALSO HAVE INFLUENCE ON THRUSTER LIFETIME. MAGNETIC SHIELDING HAS SHOWN GREAT PROMISE IN THE AREA OF EXTENDING LIFETIMES  AND THE DATA COLLECTED IN THIS WORK CAN BE USED TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF DESIGNING THE WORLD S FIRST MAGNETICALLY-SHIELDED NHT. THE X3 IS A MONUMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FIELD OF ELECTRIC PROPULSION. GOALS STATED BY NASA PUT TARGETED DISCHARGE POWER LEVELS IN THE 100S OF KW  AND THIS THRUSTER SHOULD ACHIEVE THAT. HOWEVER  IF FUTURE  FLIGHT-QUALIFIED THRUSTERS ARE TO BE BUILT  THE X3 MUST BE INTERROGATED FULLY.

MOBILE ROBOTS WITH HIGH DEXTERITY  CONTROLLED REMOTELY BY A TELE-MANIPULATION SYSTEM WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN THE EVER CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS OF SMMBS. HOWEVER  THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART OF DEXTEROUS ROBOTS IS FAR FROM READY TO BE UTILIZED BY SMMBS BECAUSE OF CHALLENGES RELATED TO ROBOT HARDWARE  CONTROL INTERFACES  AND SOFTWARE SYSTEMS. CONSISTENT WITH THE NRI&#039;S OBJECTIVE OF BUILDING &#039;CO-ROBOTS&#039;  OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A CONTROL FRAMEWORK FOR THE TELE-MANIPULATION OF LOW-COST MOBILE AND DEXTEROUS ROBOTS BY KEEPING HUMANS AT THE CENTER OF THE CONTROL LOOP. IN THIS PROJECT OUR PLAN IS TO I) DEVELOP A WHOLE BODY COMPLIANT CONTROL AND MODELING PARADIGM FOR A HUMANOID ROBOT CALLEDDREAMER  II) DESIGN AND DEVELOP A NOVEL HAND EXOSKELETON FOR THE TELEMANIPULATION OF DREAMER  AND III)DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TRANSFERRING THE EXOSKELETON CONTROL SKILLS TO TELEMANIPULATION OF THE DREAMER IN COMPLEX AND CHANGING MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENTS.PHYSICAL HUMAN ROBOT INTERACTION (PHRI)  IS ONE OF THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN HUMAN-CENTERED ROBOTICS  HOWEVER  A GENERAL THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK TO MODEL AND CONTROL PHRI SYSTEMS HAS NOT YET BEEN CONSOLIDATED. OUR GOAL IS TO LEVERAGE OUR PREVIOUS WORK ON WHOLE-BODY MODELING AND CONTROL  AND INTEGRATE NEW CONCEPTS OF PHRI TO CREATE A COMPUTATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROLMOBILE HUMANOID ROBOTS IN MANUFACTURING SETTINGS. THE DESIGN OF THE HAND EXOSKELETON WILL BE DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT THE HUMAN HAND MOVEMENTS ARE GREATLY INFLUENCED BY THE HAND JOINT STIFFNESS  AND MATCHING THE STIFFNESS IN THE EXOSKELETON WITH MECHANISMS FOR VARIABLE JOINT STIFFNESS WILL LEAD TO MORE NATURAL CONTROL  AND ALLOW FOR TUNING FORCE FEEDBACK. IN THE TELEMANIPULATION OF THE DREAMER WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGHER LEVEL DECISION MAKING BY THE USER AND THE LOWER LEVEL AUTOMATIC CONTROL ENDOWED BY THE ROBOT CONTROL INTERFACES. THE CHALLENGING TRADEOFFIN THE TELEMANIPULATION OF THE DREAMER WITH THE HAND EXOSKELETON IS THAT ON ONE HAND WE WANT TO KEEP THE OPERATOR AWAY FROM THE NITTY-GRITTY OF LOW-LEVEL CONTROL  BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE WANT TO IMMERSE THE OPERATOR IN THE HIGH-LEVEL CONTROL DECISIONS TO PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO GUIDE COMPLEX CONTROL TASKS.

FOCUS ON ATMOSPHERIC AND LACUSTRINE SCIENCE  COULD TARGET SPECIFIC IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN UNTARGETED BY ANY CURRENTLY FUNDED OR PLANNED TITAN MISSION (NATIONAL ACADEMIES  2022  2-68  Q6.3D  Q6.4  Q6.6  Q10.4B BARNES  2021). SUCH A CRAFT COULD SERVE AS A RELOCATABLE LAKE LANDER (HEREAFTER   LAKER   AFTER THE SHIPS OF AMERICA S GREAT LAKES)  WITH AN AIRBORNE DUTY CYCLE TARGET OF AROUND 25%  ENABLING DAILY HOUR-ORDER FLIGHTS. WE AIM TO UNLOCK ACCESS TO THIS CUTTING-EDGE SCIENCE WITH A FLYING LAKER. WE DESCRIBE IN THIS PAPER AN INTEGRATED  FLUIDICS APPROACH TO AERIAL ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE. CONDENSATION OF METHANE AND SUSPENDED COMPLEX ORGANICS CAN POTENTIALLY BE INGESTED THROUGH A POROUS OR PERMEABLE AIRCRAFT LEADING EDGE AND COALESCED VIA PASSIVE CAPILLARY FEATURES BEFORE DELIVERY TO THE SCIENCE PAYLOAD AS A CONTINUOUS FLUID STREAM (SEE FIGS. 2 & 5 FOR APPROACHES TO THIS). THE OPERATIONAL CHANGE FROM AIRCRAFT TO LAKER SHOULD BE NATURAL  ALLOWING ATMOSPHERIC AND LACUSTRINE SCIENCE OPERATIONS TO COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER. IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO TRANSITION IN A SEAMLESS MANNER BETWEEN THE WING-MOUNTED SYSTEM AND INLET PORTS BENEATH THE WATERLINE. CONTINUOUS ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FROM THE BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDUSTRIES COULD BE LEVERAGED (BOLZE  2019 DROUJKO  2021). THE MECHANICS OF LIQUID COLLECTION VIA A PERMEABLE (OR PERFORATED) LEADING EDGE ARE DRIVEN BY CAPILLARY ACTION. IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO AMPLIFY THE INGESTION RATE USING AN ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGATIVE PRESSURE IN THE WING. ONCE INBOARD  LIQUID IS COLLECTED IN CAPILLARY FEATURES AND COALESCED FURTHER BY A SPANWISE COLLECTION ROD  WHICH MIMICS THE COLLECTION METHODS EMPLOYED BY CACTI (JU  2012). AN EXPERIMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THIS SYSTEM AT A SMALL SCALE IN MICROGRAVITY IS IN PRELIMINARY DESIGN STAGES. FIGS. 3 & 4 SHOW AN EARLY SCALE MODEL TEST OF THE CAPILLARY COLLECTION AND COALESCENCE SYSTEM. IN THE FIGURES  THE INGESTION PERFORATIONS AND THE COLLECTION ROD TAPER ARE NEGLECTED. AN OPTION FOR COALESCENCE AND TRANSPORT COULD BE AN ARRAY OF V-GROOVE CHANNELS EACH FEATURING A VARIABLE CAPILLARY GRADIENT (FIG. 5). A THIRD OPTION IS PROMISING: BY LEVERAGING THE STRONG CAPILLARY FORCE BETWEEN A FLEXIBLE MEMBRANE AND RIGID STRUCTURE (CAMBAU  2011)  AN INFLATABLE WING SKIN LINER COULD BE USED. THIS COULD OFFER RESILIENCY AND MITIGATE SLUDGE BUILDUP PROBLEMS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure

IN PHASE I  WE INVESTIGATED KEY FEASIBILITY ASPECTS CRUCIAL TO A REACHBOT'S CAVE-EXPLORATION MISSION  AND IN PARTICULAR WE SHOWED THAT (1) REACHBOT HAS A SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED REACHABLE AND WRENCH WORKSPACE COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS  (2) LIGHTWEIGHT SURFACE GRASPING SOLUTIONS WITH SPINY GRIPPERS CAN RELIABLY GRASP ONTO ROCKY SURFACES WITH PASSIVE ACTUATION  AND (3) REACHBOT'S ENHANCED MOBILITY AND MANIPULATION STRENGTH ENABLE NEW ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC TARGETS.

(I) WE WILL OPTIMIZE REACHBOT'S REACHABLE WORKSPACE WHILE MAINTAINING STABLE CONFIGURATIONS BY DEVELOPING A QUANTITATIVE METRIC FOR ROBUSTNESS. THIS RESEARCH PILLAR ADDRESSES REACHBOT'S ABILITY TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF OTHER ROBOTS IN NAVIGATING CAVERNOUS ENVIRONMENTS.

THIS RESEARCH PILLAR SUPPORTS REACHBOT'S ADVANTAGEOUS MOBILITY PARADIGM THAT RELIES ON LOCAL PERCEPTION  AUTONOMOUS DETECTION  AND ADHERENCE TO GRASPING SITES ON CAVE WALLS. (III) WE WILL DEVELOP CONTROL STRATEGIES THAT MINIMIZE RISK TO BOLSTER MISSION FULFILLMENT  BOTH BY ANTICIPATING KNOWN RISK AND MITIGATING UNPREDICTABLE RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE  WE WILL DEVELOP CONTROLLERS THAT ACTIVELY DAMP OSCILLATIONS IN THE BOOMS  MAKING REACHBOT MORE ROBUST TO THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE OF A SUDDEN GRASP FAILURE. (IV) WE WILL STUDY REACHBOT'S PERFORMANCE IN A REALISTIC MISSION ENVIRONMENT. BY OUTLINING A DETAILED NOTIONAL MISSION  WE WILL DETERMINE REALISTIC OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS FOR REACHBOT.

THE CAPABILITY FOR CRYOGENIC REFUELING ON ORBIT AND IN SPACE REPRESENTS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE ARCHITECTURE FOR LARGE  BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT (LEO) MISSIONS WITHOUT SUPER HEAVY LIFT VEHICLES. MISSION ARCHITECTURE CONSIDERS TWO OPTIONS FOR PROPELLANT RESUPPLY  EITHER VIA TANKERS OR IN-SPACE PROPELLANT STORAGE DEPOTS. HOWEVER  AN EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE REFUEL TECHNOLOGY FOR SAFE AUTONOMOUS TRANSFER OF A CRYOGENIC PROPELLANT FROM A TANKER OR A DEPOT TO A RECEIVER IN LONG-DURATION HUMAN AND ROBOTIC MISSIONS HAS YET TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. SPACE CRYOGENIC SYSTEMS ARE SUBJECT TO HEAT LOADS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES  SUCH AS INCIDENT SOLAR RADIATION  ALBEDO OF CELESTIAL BODIES AND HEAT GENERATED BY EQUIPMENT. WHILE SPACE CRYOGENIC FLUID TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRE VAPOR-FREE LIQUID DELIVERY  THE TIME- AND LOCATION- DEPENDENT LIQUID-VAPOR FLOWS OF CRYOGENIC FLUIDS ARE ENCOUNTERED IN MOST OPERATIONS DUE TO THEIR VERY LOW BOILING POINT  LOW SPECIFIC HEAT AND ENTHALPY OF VAPORIZATION  AND UNUSUALLY LOW SURFACE TENSION. NUMEROUS TERRESTRIAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE MAJOR COMPLEXITY IN CONTROLLING LIQUID-VAPOR FLOW RESULTS FROM INSTABILITIES BROUGHT BY INTRICATE INTERACTIONS OF THE FLOW WITH LIQUID-VAPOR PHASE TRANSITIONS  SUCH AS SLOWER PROPAGATION SPEED OF PRESSURE PERTURBATIONS IN TWO-PHASE REGIONS  ACCUMULATION OF VAPOR DOWNSTREAM FROM THE LOCALLY HEATED SECTIONS AND ACOUSTIC WAVES GENERATED BY VAPOR BUBBLES. COUPLING OF THEIR LOW-FREQUENCY MODES WITH MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS AMPLIFIES EACH OTHER. ALL THESE FEATURES MAKE CRYOGENIC PIPELINES HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THERMAL HYDRODYNAMIC INSTABILITIES THAT CAN GENERATE LARGE-AMPLITUDE FLOW OSCILLATIONS AND HYDRAULIC SHOCKS (FLUID HAMMER) CAUSING FLOW CONTROL FAILURE AND EQUIPMENT DAMAGE. THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN STABILITY OF CRYOGENIC FLUID TRANSFER IN SPACE IS A TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGE THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED FOR DESIGNING EFFICIENT CRYOGENIC REFUEL SYSTEMS FOR LONG DURATION SPACE MISSIONS. COMPARED TO NORMAL GRAVITY ENVIRONMENT  FLOW OF A CRYOGENIC FLUID IN MICROGRAVITY IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN DISTRIBUTION OF LIQUID AND VAPOR FORMED WITHIN A SYSTEM. UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF GRAVITY IN TRIGGERING THERMAL-HYDRODYNAMIC INSTABILITIES IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO ENSURE CONTROLLABILITY AND SAFETY OF IN-SPACE PROPELLANT STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF CRYOGENIC PROPELLANTS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS THE FIRST STUDY TO FIND THE CRITERIA FOR STABILITY OF TRANSPORT OF CRYOGENIC FLUID  WHICH IS THE BASIC REFUEL-OPERATION  OVERHEAT AND MECHANICAL DISTURBANCES INEVITABLE IN MICROGRAVITY SPACE ENVIRONMENT. THE ROLE OF GRAVITY IN CRYOGENIC TRANSPORT OPERATION WILL BE ASSESSED BY CARRYING OUT TESTS ON EARTH AND ONBOARD AIRCRAFT FLYING PROFILES TO SIMULATE MICROGRAVITY AND THE REDUCED GRAVITY OF THE MOON OR MARS. THE CONTRAST IN EXPERIMENTAL DATA GATHERED IN FLIGHTS AND ON EARTH SHOULD ELUCIDATE THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THE GRAVITY INFLUENCE. THE PROJECT RESULTS WILL PROVIDE DIRECT GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING AND SIZING OF COST-EFFICIENT AND SAFE SYSTEMS FOR TRANSFER CRYOGENIC PROPELLANTS ON ORBIT AND IN SPACE  SUCH AS OPTIMUM PRESSURE AND FLOW RATE FOR REFUEL  CORRECT THERMAL INSULATION FOR PIPING  LEVEL OF ACCEPTABLE EQUIPMENT VIBRATIONS AND PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS IN TANKS.

WE THEN DEMONSTRATE THE SYSTEM BY COLLECTING 3D IMAGES OF ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR AND TEMPERATURE IN SUBORBITAL FLIGHT. DATA FROM SIMILAR LEGACY SENSORS ON LARGE US WEATHER SATELLITES IS CURRENTLY THE SINGLE HIGHEST IMPACT DRIVER OF GLOBAL WEATHER FORECAST ACCURACY. AS EXISTING SATELLITES REACH THE END OF THEIR SERVICE LIVES AND HIGH LEGACY SENSOR COSTS LIMIT THEIR POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT AS REPLACEMENTS  OUR NOVEL SENSOR TECHNOLOGY OFFERS A DISRUPTIVE OPPORTUNITY TO USE A COMMERCIAL BALLOON PLATFORM TO PROVIDE THE WEATHER DATA NEEDED BY A RANGE OF COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT USERS. OUR NOVEL FILTER BANK TECHNOLOGY GIVES OUR SENSOR A VARIETY OF INHERENT ADVANTAGES OVER EXISTING STATE-OF-THE-ART SENSORS  INCLUDING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SWAP-C  MORE SPECTRAL CHANNELS  AND HIGHER INTRINSIC SENSOR STABILITY. WORLDVIEW IS COMMITTED TO MAKING EXTENDED OBSERVATIONS OF NORTH AMERICA AND OTHER KEY REGIONS FROM ITS STRATOLITE BALLOON PLATFORM. MATURING OUR LOW- SWAP-C CUBESOUNDER TECHNOLOGY THEREFORE FILLS A KEY TECHNOLOGY GAP AND LETS OUR SENSOR BE DEPLOYED ON A BALLOON OR CUBESAT. THIS ENABLES COMMERCIALIZATION OF THIS HIGH-IMPACT SOURCE OF CRITICAL WEATHER DATA FOR THE FIRST TIME. MICROWAVE SOUNDING INSTRUMENTS COLLECT 3D TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY DATA BY OBSERVING 60 GHZ OXYGEN EMISSION AND 183 GHZ WATER VAPOR EMISSION. MSU THROUGH ATMS ON NOAA SATELLITES AND AMSU ON THE NASA AQUA SATELLITE ARE EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL MICROWAVE SOUNDING INSTRUMENTS ON LARGE U.S. WEATHER SATELLITES FROM 1978 TO THE PRESENT DAY. EXISTING INSTRUMENTS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT SWAP-C DUE TO THEIR RELIANCE ON CONVENTIONAL MIXER RECEIVERS DRIVEN BY LOCAL OSCILLATORS FEEDING RF FILTER BANK BACKENDS WITH LIMITED TOTAL CHANNEL COUNTS. IN CONTRAST  OUR FILTER BANK TECHNOLOGY IS COMPACT  LIGHTWEIGHT  CONSUMES NO ELECTRICAL POWER  AND HAS AN INCREASED BANDWIDTH AND CHANNEL COUNT. CUBESOUNDER LEVERAGES STANDARD WAVEGUIDE TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE HIGH SYSTEM PERFORMANCE USING COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE LNAS AND DETECTORS. TAKEN AS A WHOLE  OUR APPROACH IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT IN SWAP-C OVER EXISTING APPROACHES  ENABLING WIDE LOW-COST SENSOR DEPLOYMENT ON A RANGE OF PLATFORMS  FROM BALLOONS TO CUBESATS.

DESPITE THE RECENT ADVANCES IN MODELING AND SIMULATIONS OF FLUID-STRUCTURE INTERACTION (FSI) PHENOMENA  PARACHUTE DESIGN CONTINUES TO RELY ON EXTENSIVE GROUND AND FLIGHT TESTING. PREDICTIVE MODELS ARE NOT MATURE ENOUGH FOR DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION. COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITIES HAVE KEY GAPS IN THEIR ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL MULTIPHYSICS AND MULTI-SCALE PHENOMENA THAT CHARACTERIZE PARACHUTE SYSTEMS AND VALIDATION IS YET UNMET. LESSONS LEARNED DURING RECENT PROGRAMS  MOST NOTABLY THE LOW-DENSITY SUPERSONIC DECELERATOR (LDSD) AND ORION CAPSULE PARACHUTE ASSEMBLY SYSTEM (CPAS)  HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR IMPROVED DESIGN AND ANALYSIS TOOLS. THE LARGE NUMBER AND VARIABILITY OF NON-DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS THAT CHARACTERIZE THE AERODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE OF A PARACHUTE CHALLENGES THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS.

COMPUTERS  INSTRUMENTS  AND HOUSING MAY HEAT UP IN SPACE  AS A COMBINATION OF SOLAR ENERGY AND POOR HEAT REJECTION CAUSES TEMPERATURES TO RISE TO HUNDREDS OF DEGREES. THIS CAN BE FOUGHT BY ADVANCED RADIATORS OR MAY REQUIRE SPECIALIZED COOLING SYSTEMS. NATURALLY  THESE ATTEMPTS TO KEEP TEMPERATURES AT OPERATING LEVELS RESULT IN EXCESS MASS AND CAN PREVENT SOME MORE COMPLEX MISSIONS FROM EVEN TAKING PLACE. PELTIER COOLERS ARE SOLID STATE COOLING DEVICES WHICH UTILIZE THE SEEBECK EFFECT TO CREATE A TEMPERATURE DIFFERENTIAL USING ELECTRICAL POWER. THE PROPOSED IDEA IS AN ADVANCED PELTIER COOLER WHICH IS GREATLY ENHANCED BY EMBEDDING A SMALL AMOUNT OF ALPHA EMITTING RADIOISOTOPE IN THE FEET OF THE DEVICE TO IONIZE ATOMS AND INCREASE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY. THIS ALLOWS FOR A DRASTIC INCREASE IN THE CAPABILITIES OF EXISTING THERMAL MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES. THE MISSION PROPOSED IS TO CREATE A ROVER WHICH USES THE POLAR COOLER AND A TUNGSTEN SHIELD TO ALLOW FOR EXPLORATION OF MERCURY DURING THE DAY IN FULL SUNLIGHT. THE AUGMENTED SHIELD  CALLED THE HIGH IRRADIANCE PELTIER OPERATED TUNGSTEN EXO-REFLECTOR (HIPOWER) SHIELD  WILL PROTECT THE ROVER THROUGH A COMBINATION OF REFLECTIVITY AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT. INITIAL MODELING IN COMSOL PREDICTS THAT FOR AN IRRADIANCE OF 10 000 W/M2 THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROVER CAN BE MAINTAINED AT ~300K USING THE POLAR COOLERS. THIS CONCEPT WILL BE EVALUATED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING THREE OBJECTIVES: 1) COMPUTATIONALLY MODEL THE POLAR UNIT   USING COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS FINITE ELEMENT MODELING PROGRAM  A DATABASE WILL BE CONSTRUCTED TO PREDICT PERFORMANCE FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. ASPECTS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE  COLD AND HOT SIDE OPERATING TEMPERATURES  POWER AND VOLUME REQUIREMENTS  AND AUGMENTATION LEVELS WILL BE ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY WHICH DESIGNS ARE MOST SUITABLE FOR EACH APPLICATION. 2) TESTING IN A RADIATION FIELD  A FUNCTIONING PELTIER COOLER WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND INSERTED INTO THE TEST REACTOR AT KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY. BORON WILL BE USED AS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ALPHA SOURCE  AS IT GENERATES ALPHAS WHEN EXPOSED TO THERMAL NEUTRONS. THIS WILL EMPIRICALLY DEMONSTRATE THE CHANGE IN PERFORMANCE WHILE LIMITING COSTS AND EXPOSURE TO RADIOISOTOPES. 3) ROVER DESIGN   HOWE INDUSTRIES WILL DESIGN A ROVER CAPABLE OF MONITORING THE SURFACE OF MERCURY  GATHER SCIENTIFIC DATA USING ON BOARD INSTRUMENTS  AND REMAIN WITHIN OPERATING TEMPERATURES.

HOWEVER  DUE TO THE LOW TEMPERATURES ASSOCIATED WITH CRYOGENIC FLUIDS  EXTERNAL HEATING ACTING ON THE TANK WHERE THIS FLUID IS STORED WILL CAUSE VAPOR BUBBLES TO FORM WITHIN THE LAD THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE IN EXISTING DESIGNS.

DEPLOYABLE MEDICAL DEVICES WITH MINIMAL INSTRUMENTATION ARE A PRIORITY. THE GOAL IN PERSONALIZED MEDICINE IS TO BRING ACCURATE AND INSTANTANEOUS ACTIONABLE DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AT ANY POINT OF NEED TO ENABLE FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT HEALTHCARE  AND SPACE MEDICINE CAN BENEFIT FROM INCORPORATING THOSE PRACTICES IN SPACE EXPLORATION MISSIONS. THIS PROPOSAL IS CENTERED ON A PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY BASED ON A NOVEL SILICON CHIP CONCEPT CALLED NANOFLUIDIC PROCESSOR (NFP) THAT IS EMBEDDED IN A SINGLE-USE  LOW-COST TEST CARD. THE NFP FULLY PASSIVELY CONTROLS A COMPLETE SET OF SAMPLE MANIPULATIONS WITHOUT THE NEED OF EXTERNAL ACTUATION OR INSTRUMENTATION. THIS IS POSSIBLE SINCE SAMPLE MANIPULATIONS HAPPEN SOLELY BY MEANS OF CAPILLARY FORCES ENABLED BY PRECISELY MANUFACTURED GEOMETRIC MICROSTRUCTURES INSIDE THE SILICON CHIP. AS A CONSEQUENCE  THE OPERATION OF THE NFP CAN THEORETICALLY ALSO TAKE PLACE IN GRAVITY-INDEPENDENT ENVIRONMENTS. ADDITIONALLY  CAPABILITIES SUCH AS THERMOCYCLING FOR NUCLEIC ACID DETECTION (E.G. USEFUL FOR THE DETECTION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES SUCH AS INFLUENZA) AND OPTICAL WAVEGUIDES FOR THE DETECTION OF PROTEINS AND SMALL MOLECULES (E.G. USEFUL FOR THE MONITORING OF BONE DEGRADATION OR CARDIAC MARKERS) CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO THE NFP TO BROADEN THE CAPABILITIES OF THE PLATFORM TO A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF ANALYTES OF DIAGNOSTIC VALUE MEASURED NOWADAYS ON EARTH. AFTER THE SAMPLE IS BEING PROCESSED BY THE NFP  THESE ANALYTES ARE DETECTED OUT BY A COMPACT  LIGHTWEIGHT READER  SIMILAR TO A CREDIT CARD AND ITS CARD READER. THE NFP WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY IMEC  THE WORLD-LEADING R&D CENTER FOR NANO ELECTRONICS AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES  AND IS NOW BEING FURTHER DEVELOPED AT THE IMEC SPIN-OFF MIDIAGNOSTICS. CURRENTLY  THE NFP HAS REACHED THE STAGE OF AN INTEGRATED TEST CARD PROTOTYPE (TRL4) THAT PERFORMS A COMPLETE CELL BLOOD COUNT  OR CBC WITH DIFFERENTIAL  FROM A DROP OF BLOOD. A CBC TEST IS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY ORDERED TESTS BY DOCTORS  AND PROVIDES RELEVANT INSIGHTS INTO AN INDIVIDUAL S HEALTH STATUS. THE FOLLOWING IS A PROPOSAL FOR A PLAN TO TEST THE NFP SYSTEM IN AN ENVIRONMENT SUBJECTED TO DIFFERENT GRAVITATIONAL LOADS  BEFORE FINAL TESTING IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT (LEO) ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) AT A LATER STAGE. AS MENTIONED ABOVE  THE PROPRIETARY MICROFLUIDIC ARCHITECTURE OF THE NFP ENABLES THE DISTRIBUTION OF SAMPLE AND SOLUTIONS IN A GRAVITY-INDEPENDENT MANNER  HOWEVER  THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED TO DATE. PARABOLIC FLIGHT  WITH ITS ASSOCIATED GRAVITATIONAL FLUCTUATIONS  IS THE IDEAL PLATFORM TO TEST THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE SYSTEM. THE LENGTH OF THE FLIGHT ALLOWS FOR SUFFICIENT TIME TO OPERATE SEVERAL PARALLEL AND SEQUENTIAL RUNS  AFTER WHICH A SOLID PROOF-OF-CONCEPT WOULD BE COMPLETED. THE CBC TEST CARD IS THE FIRST OF A SUITE OF DIAGNOSTICS SOLUTIONS INTENDED FOR FURTHER CONSOLIDATED BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS TESTS IN POINT-OF-CARE SETTINGS. THIS PLATFORM VERSATILITY IS IDEAL FOR USE IN THE VEHICLES AND HABITATS VENTURING ONTO THE MOON AND MARS IN THE FUTURE. BY TESTING THE FUNCTION OF THIS FIRST TEST CARD  THE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT FOR DEVICES BASED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ACHIEVED  THEREFORE PERMITTING THEIR CONSIDERATION FOR OPERATIONAL USE IN SPACE MEDICINE. IN SUMMARY  WHILE SEVERAL MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES HAVE BEEN EVALUATED FOR APPLICATIONS IN HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT  THIS IS THE FIRST SILICON MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM OF ITS KIND (GIVEN IT IS SOLELY ACTUATED BY CAPILLARY FORCES)  WHICH MAY PROVIDE A TRUE LOW MASS/VOLUME/POWER SOLUTION FOR THE NUMEROUS DIAGNOSTICS/BIOANALYTICAL NEEDS TO MONITOR CREW HEALTH STATUS.

THIS PAYLOAD COMBINES TWO INSTRUMENTS TO DEVELOP A LOW COST  RELIABLE METHOD OF CHARACTERIZING LOCAL LUNAR SURFACE RADIATION AND MAGNETIC FIELD ENVIRONMENTS ON ROVERS AND LANDERS. SUCH A CAPABILITY IS VITAL BECAUSE LUNAR SURFACE MAGNETIC FIELDS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND DIRECTLY IMPACT THE RADIATION EXPOSURE AT EACH PARTICULAR LANDING SITE (WHICH CAN BE EXTREMELY HARMFUL TO HUMANS AND EQUIPMENT). HOWEVER  LITTLE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE LUNAR SURFACE EXIST AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ACTUAL ENVIRONMENT. SO OUR PROPOSED PAYLOAD IS REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONDITIONS OF EACH SPECIFIC LANDING SITE. COORDINATED RADIATION AND MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENTS WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INSIGHT INTO HOW CRUSTAL MAGNETIC FIELDS IMPACT THE LOCAL RADIATION ENVIRONMENT. AS AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF THIS FLIGHT TEST  THE JANUS-PIMS WILL BE USED AS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO MEASURE CHARGED PARTICLES AT SUBORBITAL ALTITUDES FROM A COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT WHICH WILL VERIFY THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING ROUTINE OBSERVATIONS ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING EARTH S ATMOSPHERE AT SUCH ALTITUDES. TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTION: APL IS ITERATIVELY APPLYING COMMERCIAL SRLVS TO REDUCE INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT COST  SCHEDULE AND RISK. A KEY ELEMENT OF OUR PROGRAM IS ESTABLISHING A COMMON SPACECRAFT INTEGRATION PLATFORM (JANUS) THAT ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR DEVELOPING COMPLETE AND INDEPENDENT PAYLOADS FOR EVERY MISSION. OVER THE LAST 8 YEARS  WE HAVE EVOLVED THE JANUS DESIGN THROUGH 6 SUCCESSFUL TEST FLIGHTS. FOR THIS PROPOSAL  WE WILL INTEGRATE JANUS WITH OUR PLASMA INSTRUMENT FOR MAGNETIC SOUNDING (PIMS) INSTRUMENT (UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR THE EUROPA CLIPPER MISSION BUT ADAPTED FOR THE LUNAR ENVIRONMENT) TO MEASURE LOWER ENERGY (&LT;100 EV) CHARGED PARTICLES. THE PROPOSED FLIGHT TEST WILL ADVANCE THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR LUNAR (AND BEYOND) APPLICATIONS. AFTER SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT TEST OF THE PROPOSED JANUS-PIMS  WE CAN COMBINE THIS PAYLOAD WITH OUR (HIGHER ENERGY) RADIATION MONITORING SYSTEM (ERM) WHICH IS A MATURE SENSOR WITH FLIGHT HERITAGE ON NASA S VAN ALLEN PROBE MISSION (AND ALSO SELECTED FOR THE EUROPA CLIPPER MISSION). WE REQUIRE THE PIMS INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE LOWER ENERGY PARTICLES SO WE CAN CHARACTERIZE THE ENTIRE RADIATION SPECTRUM.

CURRENT STATE-OF- THE-ART TECHNOLOGIES FOR PASSIVE HEAT SWITCHES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE MAIN CATEGORIES: PHASE-CHANGE BASED  GAS-GAP  AND THERMOMECHANICAL SWITCHES. HOWEVER  MOST OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE EITHER BULKY OR NOT SCALABLE (E.G.  PARAFFIN OR GAS-GAP SWITCHES)  OR HAVE MODERATE SWITCHING RATIOS (E.G.  HEAT PIPE  VARIABLE EMISSIVITY  OR THERMAL EXPANSION SWITCHES). FEW PROMISING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY SWITCHES AND LIQUID-VAPOR PHASE CHANGE DIODES OR SWITCHES. ELECTROSTATIC OR ELECTROWETTING-ON-DIELECTRIC-BASED SWITCHES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ACHIEVE SWITCHING RATIOS UP TO 1000: 1  BUT REQUIRE ACTIVE ACTUATION.

FURTHERMORE  THE SWITCH IS COMPACT  LIGHT-WEIGHT  AND IS PASSIVELY TEMPERATURE-ACTUATED. SUPPORTED BY PRELIMINARY RESULTS  WHICH YIELDED A CONDUCTANCE RATIO OF 72:1  WE PROPOSE TO DESIGN  FABRICATE  AND CHARACTERIZE A ROBUST HEAT SWITCH BASED ON ROOM-TEMPERATURE LIQUID METAL. THE PROPOSED HEAT SWITCH WILL BE BASED ON THE MANIPULATION OF A LIQUID METAL WITHIN A 9 CM LONG  4 CM WIDE  AND 1 MM TALL CHANNEL. THE PRESENCE OR THE ABSENCE OF THE LIQUID METAL NEAR A HEAT SOURCE AFFECTS HEAT FLOW FROM THE SOURCE TO THE SINK BY A FACTOR OF 500 OR MORE. GALLIUM-BASED ALLOYS HAVE THE HIGHEST THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES OF ALL LIQUIDS (17-40 W/M-K VS. 0.02 (AIR) TO 0.6 (WATER) W/M-K)  AND ALLOW FOR EASY MANIPULATION  ARE THERMALLY AND CHEMICALLY STABLE  AND ADAPT EASILY TO DIFFERENT TOPOLOGIES. THE SWITCH WILL BE PASSIVELY CONTROLLED BASED ON THERMAL EXPANSION MISMATCH. AT HIGH TEMPERATURES  I.E.  IN THE ON STATE  THE METAL WILL BE IN ITS LIQUID STATE AND CONNECT THE HEAT SOURCE TO THE HEAT SINK. AT LOW TEMPERATURES  I.E.  IN THE OFF STATE  THE METAL WILL DISCONNECT THE INNER COMPONENTS OF THE VEHICLE WITH THE SHELL AND SOLIDIFY IN THE OFF POSITION. THE SWITCH WILL ENABLE CONTROL OF HEAT FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE TIME SCALES AND DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HEAT LOAD.

THE REQUIREMENT TO LAND A SIGNIFICANTLY HEAVIER MASS FOR A HUMAN MISSION BY ALL-PROPULSIVE SYSTEM ALSO PUTS MUCH GREATER PREMIUM ON REDUCING THE PROPELLANT CONSUMPTION DURING THE POWERED DESCENT AND LANDING. LANDING HUMAN ON THE MOON AND RETURNING TO EARTH IN A SAFER  MORE FLEXIBLE AND ACCURATE FASHION THAN IN THE APOLLO ERA IS MADE FEASIBLE WITH ADVANCED EDL GUIDANCE  NAVIGATION  AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES. FOR A HUMAN MARS MISSION  AEROCAPTURE IS AN ENABLING TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN PLACE THE ARRIVING SPACECRAFT IN A MARTIAN ORBIT WITH LITTLE PROPELLANT USAGE. TO ACHIEVE THE HIGH PRECISION FOR ENSURED MISSION SUCCESS WHILE REQUIRING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF PROPELLANT  THE GUIDANCE ALGORITHMS MUST BE ROBUST  ACCURATE  AND OPTIMAL. UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER APPROACH IN GUIDANCE ANALYSIS AND DESIGN  THE ENTRY AND POWERED DESCENT GUIDANCE NEEDS TO WORK TOGETHER TO DETERMINE THE BEST ENTRY CONDITION  ENTRY TRAJECTORY AND POWERED DESCENT AND LANDING MANEUVERS TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE AND PRECISION IN ALL POSSIBLE SCENARIOS. IN ADDITION  RECENT STUDIES HAVE BROUGHT THE POSSIBILITY THAT NON-TRADITIONAL AEROCAPTURE AND ENTRY FLIGHT WITH THE SO-CALLED DIRECT FORCE CONTROL APPROACH MAY YIELD BENEFITS OVER THE TRADITIONAL BANK-ANGLE-ONLY AEROASSIST FLIGHT IN CERTAIN CASES. THIS PROJECT CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF TASKS THAT AIM AT DEVELOPING  MATURING AND INCREASING THE TRL LEVELS OF THE ADVANCED AEROASSIST AND POWERED GUIDANCE ALGORITHMS INCLUDING AEROCAPTURE  ENTRY  POWERED DESCENT  AND PLANETARY ASCENT GUIDANCE ALGORITHMS  INFUSING AND ASSISTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE ALGORITHMS AT NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER  AND INVESTIGATING AND EVALUATING ALTERNATIVE NEW APPROACHES AND CONCEPTS WITH THESE TOOLS.

AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF DEMISTING IN THE UNIQUE MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT COULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE SPACE TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP TABS ELEMENT 6.1.2: WATER RECOVERY AND MANAGEMENT. FREE LIQUID DROPLETS ARE A PRODUCT OF MANY PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH SPACE TRAVEL. A SMALL SAMPLE OF SUCH PROCESSES INCLUDES VIGOROUS BOILING  SWEEP GAS DROPLET ENTRAINMENT  PIPETTING  DROPLET SPRAY WATERING SYSTEMS FOR PLANTS  LID REMOVAL  AND CONDENSING HEAT EXCHANGERS.

THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY USED ON THE ISS EMPLOYED ZEOLITE 5A TO CAPTURE CO2  AND REQUIRED PRETREATMENT OF THE INLET GAS STREAM TO REMOVE ANY WATER BEFORE CONTACTING THE ZEOLITE MATERIAL. THIS TECHNOLOGY SERVED THE ISS FOR 16 YEARS AND SUPPORTED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MEANINGFUL SPACE RESEARCH  HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE IN ORDER TO PRODUCE MORE EFFICIENT MATERIALS FOR FUTURE SPACE VESSELS. THIS ZEOLITE MATERIAL IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO WATER  BOTH IN HAVING A STRONG AFFINITY FOR WATER BINDING  LEADING TO LOSS OF CO2 CAPACITY OVER TIME  AND IN UNDERGOING STRUCTURAL DEGRADATION IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER  LEADING TO DUSTING. FURTHERMORE  REGENERATION OF ZEOLITE 5A REQUIRES HARSH CONDITIONS OF HIGH VACUUM AND TEMPERATURES UP TO 400 C.

PERVAPORATION IS ADVANTAGEOUS  COMPARED TO PROCESSES LIKE DISTILLATION  IN THAT IT CAN EASILY BE OPERATED AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURES. IT CAN BREAK AZEOTROPES AND LIMIT TRANSFER OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS)  THUS LIMITING THE TRANSMISSION OF UNDESIRED SPECIES INTO THE PURIFIED WATER. PERVAPORATION IS CAPABLE OF HANDLING HIGHLY CONCENTRATED BRINES WHEN COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL PROCESSES  SINCE IT IS NOT LIMITED BY THE CONCENTRATION OF SOLUTES IN THE FEED.

THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY DRAWN TO THE ADVANTAGES THAT AM PROVIDES OVER TRADITIONAL METHODS  SUCH AS INCREASED BUILD FLEXIBILITY AND SIGNIFICANT MASS REDUCTION.

LGMO IS BASED ON TWO NEW INNOVATIONS THAT TOGETHER SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF AFFORDABLE LUNAR POLAR ICE MINING FOR PROPELLANT PRODUCTION. THE FIRST INNOVATION IS BASED ON A NEW INSIGHT INTO LUNAR TOPOGRAPHY: OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE LARGE (HUNDREDS OF METERS) LANDING AREAS IN SMALL (0.5-1.5 KM) NEARPOLAR CRATERS ON WHICH THE SURFACE IS PERMAFROST IN PERPETUAL DARKNESS BUT WITH PERPETUAL SUNLIGHT AVAILABLE AT ALTITUDES OF ONLY 10S TO 100S OF METERS. IN THESE PROSPECTIVE LANDING SITES  DEPLOYABLE SOLAR ARRAYS HELD VERTICALLY ON MASTS 100 M OR SO IN LENGTH (LIGHTWEIGHT AND FEASIBLE IN LUNAR GRAVITY) CAN PROVIDE NEARLY CONTINUOUS POWER. THIS MEANS THAT A LARGE LANDER  SUCH AS THE BLUE MOON VEHICLE PROPOSED BY BLUE ORIGIN  A BFR; OR A MODESTLY SIZED LUNAR ICE MINING OUTPOST COULD SIT ON MINEABLE PERMAFROST WITH SOLAR ARRAYS IN PERPETUAL SUNLIGHT ON MASTS PROVIDING AFFORDABLE ELECTRIC POWER WITHOUT THE NEED TO SEPARATE POWER SUPPLY FROM THE LOAD. .THE SECOND ENABLING INNOVATION FOR LGMO IS RADIANT GAS DYNAMIC (RGD) MINING. RGD MINING IS A NEW PATENT PENDING TECHNOLOGY INVENTED BY TRANSASTRA TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMICALLY AND RELIABLY PROSPECTING AND EXTRACTING LARGE QUANTITIES (1 000S OF TONS PER YEAR) OF VOLATILE MATERIALS FROM LUNAR REGOLITH USING LANDED PACKAGES OF JUST A FEW TONS EACH. TO OBVIATE THE PROBLEMS OF MECHANICAL DIGGING AND EXCAVATION  RGD MINING USES A COMBINATION OF RADIO FREQUENCY  MICROWAVE  AND INFRARED RADIATION TO HEAT PERMAFROST AND OTHER TYPES OF ICE DEPOSITS WITH A DEPTH-CONTROLLED HEATING PROFILE. THIS SUBLIMATES THE ICE AND ENCOURAGES A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THE VOLATILES TO MIGRATE UPWARD OUT OF THE REGOLITH INTO CRYOTRAPS WHERE IT CAN BE STORED IN LIQUID FORM. RGD MINING TECHNOLOGY IS INTEGRATED INTO LONG DURATION ELECTRIC POWERED ROVERS. IN USE  THE VEHICLES STOP AT MINING LOCATIONS AND LOWER THEIR COLLECTION DOMES TO GATHER AVAILABLE WATER FROM AN AREA BEFORE MOVING ON. WHEN ON-BOARD STORAGE TANKS ARE FULL  THE VEHICLES RETURN TO BASE TO EMPTY TANKS BEFORE MOVING BACK OUT INTO THE FIELD TO CONTINUE HARVESTING. THE ROVER CAN BE BATTERY OPERATED AND RECHARGE AT BASE OR CARRY A LASER RECEIVER POWERED BY A REMOTE LASER. BASED ON THESE INNOVATIONS  LGMO PROMISES TO VASTLY REDUCE THE COST OF ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING A SIZABLE LUNAR POLAR OUTPOST THAT CAN SERVE FIRST AS A FIELD STATION FOR NASA ASTRONAUTS EXPLORING THE MOON  AND THEN AS THE BEACHHEAD FOR AMERICAN LUNAR INDUSTRIALIZATION  STARTING WITH FULFILLING COMMERCIAL PLANS FOR A LUNAR HOTEL FOR TOURISTS. .RGD MINING WILL ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRACTICAL SYSTEM THAT CAN BE CONSTRUCTED ON A MOBILE PLATFORM TO ENABLE THE USE OF A MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF RADIANT ENERGY WITH DIFFERENT PENETRATION DEPTHS TO CONTROL THE RELEASE OF WATER VAPOR FROM HARD LUNAR PERMAFROST IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN BE TRAPPED AND CAPTURED BY A WATER COLLECTION SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH MICROWAVE EXTRACTION METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THE PAST THEY HAVE TYPICALLY REQUIRED PRIOR EXCAVATION OF SUBSTRATE MATERIAL OR DID NOT INCLUDE METHODS TO PREVENT RE-TRAPPING OF WATER BY COLD REGOLITH. BY USING A MULTI FREQUENCY RADIANT SYSTEM  RGD PROVIDES A VARIABLE HEATING PROFILE THAT SUBLIMATES WATER VAPOR IN LAYERS FROM THE TOP DOWN AND ENCOURAGES EVOLVED WATER TO MIGRATE INTO CRYOTRAPS IN THE VEHICLE WHILE MINIMIZING REFREEZING OF THE WATER VAPOR IN THE SURROUNDING SUBSTRATE. THIS DESIGN COMBINES SUBSURFACE ICE PROSPECTING VIA LOW VOLTAGE DC SUBSURFACE SENSING INTEGRATED WITH TRL-6 DRILLS FOR DETECTION AND VOLATILE GAS COLLECTION IN A SINGLE VEHICLE.

THE INFLATED TORI FORM A CONICAL SHAPE AND ARE COVERED WITH A FLEXIBLE THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 1. EACH TORUS IS FABRICATED FROM A FLEXIBLE  BRAIDED FABRIC SHELL WITH INTEGRAL REINFORCING CORDS THAT ARE PRE-STRESSED BY THE INTERNAL INFLATION PRESSURE (HUGHES ET AL.  2005; CLAPP ET AL.  2016A). THE INDIVIDUAL TORI ARE STRAPPED TOGETHER AND ATTACHED TO THE RIGID CENTER-BODY OF THE STRUCTURE THAT ACCOMMODATES THE PAYLOAD.

INTEGRATE THE INTERFACE MODEL INTO A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED FINITE ELEMENT MODEL OF THE FSW PROCESS. 4. VALIDATE THE FSW MODEL RESULTS FOR TORQUE  REACTIVE LOAD  AND TEMPERATURES FOR STANDARD FSW TOOLS AND FOR A SELF-REACTING FSW TOOL. IN PRIOR EFFORTS  THE FRICTION LEVEL HAS BEEN AN ADJUSTABLE PARAMETER USED TO \"TUNE\" A FINITE ELEMENT MODEL FOR FSW. HOWEVER  THIS SIMPLE TUNING APPROACH NEGLECTS THE UNDERLYING PHYSICS AT THE INTERFACE  AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS FOR ALL OF THE CRITICAL PHENOMENA THAT WOULD RENDER THE MODEL TRULY PREDICTIVE AND USEFUL FOR DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE  IF THE MODEL IS \"TUNED\" FOR AN ACCURATE PREDICTION OF TEMPERATURES  THEN THE REACTIVE LOAD IS OFTEN OVERESTIMATED. THIS RESULTS IN INACCURATE STRESS PREDICTIONS WITHIN THE PART.

THERMOCOUPLES WILL BE EMBEDDED IN THE AL PLATE TO MEASURE TEMPERATURES NEAR THE INTERFACE. THEY WILL ALSO BE EMBEDDED IN THE TOOL. DATA COMING OUT OF THE EXPERIMENT WILL BE TORQUE  REACTIVE LOAD  AND TEMPERATURES IN THE PLATE AND THE TOOL. 2. A FINITE ELEMENT MODEL OF THE FLAT  PINLESS TOOL EXPERIMENT WILL BE DEVELOPED AND COUPLED WITH AN INVERSE PARAMETER ANALYSIS ALGORITHM TO MODEL THE LOCAL FLOW STRESSES IN THE HGZ. 3. THE LOCAL FLOW STRESS RELATIONSHIP FROM TASK #2 WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO AN EULERIAN FINITE ELEMENT MODEL OF FSW  DEVELOPED IN PRIOR EFFORTS BY THE PIS. 4. THE FSW MODEL WILL BE VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENTS  SUCH THAT TEMPERATURES  REACTIVE WELDING LOAD  AND WELDING TORQUE ARE ALL PREDICTED  SIMULTANEOUSLY  WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY (5%). INITIAL VALIDATION WILL BE WITH A SMOOTH TOOL. AFTER APPROPRIATE AGREEMENT ON A SMOOTH TOOL  A TOOL WITH A THREADED PIN WILL BE EMPLOYED IN THE MODEL AND VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENT. FINALLY  A SELF-REACTING FSW TOOL WILL BE MODELED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENT. MODEL RESULTS WILL BE USED TO PREDICT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES IN THE HEAT AFFECTED ZONE OF THE WELD.

THE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION THAT WILL ENABLE EXTREMELY HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING CAPABILITY  OTHERWISE UNATTAINABLE WITH CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES  IS BASED ON A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL DIFFRACTIVE OPTICAL SENSING  ADVANCED IMAGE PROCESSING  AND SMALL SATELLITE FORMATION FLYING. WHILE THE ADVENT OF SUCH IMAGING TECHNOLOGY HAS POTENTIAL FOR BROAD IMPACT IN MANY AREAS OF SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION WITHIN NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE  OUR INITIAL TARGETED SCIENCE AREA IS WITHIN THE DOMAIN OF HELIOPHYSICS AND WILL ADDRESS ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR INVESTIGATING CORONAL HEATING.  ENERGY DISSIPATION IN THE SOLAR CORONA IS BELIEVED TO OCCUR IN EXTREMELY THIN CURRENT SHEETS OF ORDER 1-100 KM. EMISSION FROM THESE HOT BUT THIN CURRENT SHEETS SHOULD BE VISIBLE IN CORONAL EUV EMISSION LINES. HOWEVER  THIS SPATIAL SCALE IS FAR BELOW THE RESOLUTION OF EXISTING IMAGING INSTRUMENTS  SO THESE DISSIPATION SITES HAVE NEVER BEEN OBSERVED INDIVIDUALLY. CONVENTIONAL OPTICS CANNOT BE MANUFACTURED WITH SUFFICIENT SURFACE FIGURE ACCURACY TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED SPATIAL RESOLUTION IN THE EXTREME-ULTRAVIOLET WHERE THESE HOT PLASMAS RADIATE. A PHOTON SIEVE  A DIFFRACTIVE IMAGING ELEMENT SIMILAR TO A FRESNEL ZONE PLATE  CAN BE MANUFACTURED TO PROVIDE  A FEW MILLI-ARCSEC (MAS) RESOLUTION  WITH MUCH MORE READILY ACHIEVABLE TOLERANCES THAN WITH CONVENTIONAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY. SINCE THE FOCAL LENGTH OF SUCH DIFFRACTIVE LENSES IS WAVELENGTH-DEPENDENT  A FULL-SCALE ULTRA-HIGH RESOLUTION INSTRUMENT WILL REQUIRE COMPUTATIONAL IMAGE DECONVOLUTION TO DISENTANGLE SUPERIMPOSED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MULTIPLE WAVELENGTHS ALONG WITH FORMATION FLYING (WITH THE DIFFRACTIVE ELEMENT AND THE DETECTOR ON DIFFERENT SMALL SATELLITES WITH PROPER SEPARATION).  THEREFORE  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH FOR THIS NRA HAS TWO INTERTWINED COMPONENTS THAT WILL BE PURSUED CONCURRENTLY AND IN CLOSE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE UIUC AND GSFC INVESTIGATORS. THE UIUC TEAM WILL DEVELOP OPTIMAL STRATEGIES FOR THE FORMULATION OF THE INHERENT INVERSE PROBLEM OF PHOTON SIEVE IMAGE DECONVOLUTION. RIGOROUS PERFORMANCE QUANTIFICATION NECESSITATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPROPRIATE DECONVOLUTION ALGORITHMS THAT TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF MEASUREMENT DIVERSITY TO PRODUCE THE HIGHEST-ATTAINABLE-RESOLUTION IMAGERY VIA THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF NUMERICAL OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS.

IMAGES WILL BE TAKEN AT VARIOUS AXIAL FOCAL POSITIONS  AND THE DATA FROM THIS SIMULATION WILL BE USED TO VALIDATE THE DECONVOLUTION  AND TO QUANTIFY AND DEMONSTRATE THE MAS IMAGING SYSTEM'S PERFORMANCE IN A REALISTIC EXPERIMENTAL SETTING.

A SOLUTION TO IMPROVE THIS SITUATION WOULD BE TO USE SELF-PROPELLED SMALL SATELLITES  SUCH AS CUBESATS. THEIR LOW MASS AND VOLUME WOULD IN PRINCIPLE ALLOW FLOTILLAS OF THEM TO BE DEPLOYED INTO DEEP-SPACE TO A VARIETY OF DESTINATIONS AND ACCOMPLISH SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION RETURN AT A RATE MUCH HIGHER THAN TODAY. HOWEVER  A NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES NEED TO BE RESOLVED BEFORE SMALL SPACECRAFT CAN BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. HIGH DELTA-V PROPULSION EQUIVALENT TO ION THRUSTERS USED IN LARGER MISSIONS (SUCH AS DAWN)  AND COMPACT GNC  ACS AND COMM ARE STILL NOT DEMONSTRATED IN BEYOND- LEO SMALL SATELLITES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY THAT WOULD ALLOW CUBESATS (3U  6U) AND PERHAPS OTHER FORM FACTORS  TO INCLUDE ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF DEMONSTRATING THAT SUCH VEHICLES  WHEN DEPLOYED INTO RELATIVELY MORE ACCESSIBLE GTO OR GEO ORBITS  COULD ACHIEVE ENOUGH DELTA-V TO REACH DEEP-SPACE DESTINATIONS. ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS USE ZERO-VAPOR PRESSURE  NONTOXIC IONIC LIQUIDS AS PROPELLANTS. A STRONG ELECTRIC FIELD IS APPLIED TO SHARP EMITTING STRUCTURES WETTED WITH THESE LIQUIDS TO EXTRACT AND ACCELERATE IONS PRODUCING THRUST AT HIGH SPECIFIC IMPULSE. IN PARTICULAR  WE ARE INTERESTED IN NEAR EARTH ASTEROIDS (NEO'S) DUE TO THEIR ABUNDANCE AND POTENTIAL FOR SCIENTIFIC RETURN. EXISTING ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION SYSTEMS (POWER ELECTRONICS  CONTROL  RESERVOIRS AND THRUSTERS) ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN LESS THAN 0.5U OF A CUBESAT AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED LIFETIMES OF ABOUT 500 HOURS. WE PROPOSE TO USE OF EXISTING DEVICES IN A CONFIGURATION WHERE THRUSTERS ARE EJECTED (OR STAGED) BEFORE THEY SHOW DEGRADATION SIGNS  SUCH THAT THE PROPULSION SYSTEM MAKES USE OF \"FRESH\" THRUSTERS DURING THE MISSION AND THEREFORE EXTEND THE LIFETIME OF STATE-OF-THE-ART DEVICES TO THE REQUIRED ~3000 HOURS NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH A TYPICAL GEO-NEO TRANSFER. THIS APPROACH LEVERAGES THE CHARACTERISTIC THAT ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS ARE MICRO-MACHINED DEVICES HAVING LESS THAN 3% OF THE MASS AND LESS THAN 0.05% OF THE VOLUME OF THE REST OF THE PROPULSION SYSTEM. WE PROPOSE TO EXPLORE THE STRATEGY TO EJECT (DEPLETED) RESERVOIRS AND FIRED THRUSTERS AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE SPACECRAFT IN ITS INTENDED TRAJECTORY. THE EJECTED MASS WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE SPACECRAFT TO INCREASE ITS ACCELERATION  THUS SHORTENING THRUSTER RUNS AND IMPROVING MISSION PERFORMANCE. THIS APPROACH WOULD ALSO ADD REDUNDANCY AND ROBUSTNESS  BY ALWAYS HAVING MORE THRUSTERS ON BOARD THAN THOSE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE MISSION  WITHOUT PENALIZING THE OVERALL MASS AND VOLUME BUDGETS.

HOWEVER  THE CHALLENGES OF LEVITATING DUST CLOUDS IN 1G INCLUDE SIZE SORTING DUE TO GRAVITY AND PREFERENTIAL PARTICLE ORIENTATION DUE TO THE LEVITATING MEDIUM. CLOUD LEVITATION IN MICROGRAVITY IS ALSO LIMITED BY HARDWARE CONSTRAINTS (CELL WALLS) AND RESIDUAL ACCELERATIONS OF THE FLIGHT PLATFORM.

THE PHYSICAL CONCEPT AT THE CORE OF THE DIMS TECHNOLOGY IS THERMOPHORESIS: THE RESPONSE OF DUST PARTICLES INSIDE A RAREFIED GAS TO THE FORCE OF A TEMPERATURE GRADIENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE TEST FLIGHT WITH BLUE ORIGIN IS THE DEMONSTRATION OF DIMS FUNCTIONALITY AND OPERATION UNDER SEVERAL MINUTES OF MICROGRAVITY. TO THIS END  DIMS IS COMPOSED OF TWO SUBSYSTEMS  THE DUST PRODUCTION MECHANISM (DPM) AND THE CLOUD MANIPULATION SYSTEM (CMS). THE DMP CREATES CLOUDS OF DUST PARTICLES FROM ON-BOARD RESERVOIR CARTRIDGES AND INJECTS THEM INTO THE MAIN EXPERIMENT CHAMBER. THIS SUBSYSTEM ALLOWS FOR VARIOUS DUST TYPES AND CLOUD NUMBER DENSITIES TO BE CREATED. THE CMS USES THERMOPHORESIS TO CONTROL THE POSITION OF THE DUST CLOUD  THUS COMPENSATING FOR ANY RESIDUAL ACCELERATIONS THAT MIGHT INDUCE CLOUD DRIFT. THE CMS IS ALSO ABLE TO INCREASE THE COLLISION RATE INSIDE THE CLOUD  THUS CONTROLLING THE INTER-PARTICLE COLLISION CONDITIONS AND PARTICLE GROWTH.

THE CURRENT PROJECT IS AN EFFORT TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE GAUGING RESOLUTION OF MPG IN SLOSHING PROPELLANT THROUGH THE INCLUSION OF A FREE-FLOATING DIAPHRAGM THAT CAN BE POSITIONED AUTONOMOUSLY WITHIN THE LIQUID USING SMALL MAGNETIC FIELD GRADIENTS  AND WHICH CAN BE STIFFENED BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE OVER ITS UN-ACTIVATED STATE USING STATIC MAGNETIC FIELDS. WHEN INTEGRATED WITH THE MPG FLIGHT RIG  THE DIAPHRAGM   A MAGNETO-ACTIVE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT DEVICE (MAPMD)   CAN BE AUTONOMOUSLY CONTROLLED SUCH THAT IT REMAINS NEAR THE LIQUID SURFACE OF THE CYLINDRICAL TANK AT ALL FILL LEVELS AND CAN STIFFEN IN RESPONSE TO SLOSH SURGES. THE MAPMD IS A PATENTED TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED BY EMBRY RIDDLE AERONAUTICAL UNIVERSITY AND HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFECTIVE SLOSH SUPPRESSION IN 1-G LABORATORY TESTING. THE DIAPHRAGM CONSISTS OF A METALLIC ALLOY MESH EMBEDDED IN A FLEXIBLE POLYMER MATRIX. THE PARTICULAR METALLIC ALLOY BELONGS TO A CLASS OF MATERIALS THAT EXHIBIT UNUSUALLY LARGE MAGNETOSTRICTION   ELONGATION UNDER APPLIED MAGNETIC FIELDS. WHEN THE MESH IS EXPOSED TO AN EXTERNAL  STATIC MAGNETIC FIELD  THE FIBERS OF THE MESH EXPAND CAUSING THE MESH TO STIFFEN. THE ACTIVATED (RIGID) MESH SUPPRESSES SLOSH WAVES IN AN UNDERLYING LIQUID. UNDER A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD  THE MAPMD FLOATS ON THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID. IN MICROGRAVITY  THE POSITION AND MOTION OF THE DIAPHRAGM CAN BE CONTROLLED AUTONOMOUSLY BY A SET OF FIELD COILS EXTERNAL TO THE TANK THAT BOTH SENSE THE POSITION OF THE DIAPHRAGM AND PROVIDE FIELD GRADIENTS TO DRIVE THE DIAPHRAGM INTO POSITION AT THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID. IN COMPUTER SIMULATIONS  THE FIELD GRADIENT CONTROL (FGC) METHOD OF POSITIONING THE MAPMD HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE DIAPHRAGM  BUT REQUIRES PARABOLIC FLIGHTS TO ESTABLISH OPERATIONAL VALUES OF KEY PARAMETERS. MPG IS A WELL-TESTED TRL6 TECHNOLOGY PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED BY THE FLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM TO DEMONSTRATE THE NON-INVASIVE MEASUREMENT OF PROPELLANT IN ZERO-G USING SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVES PROPAGATING ON THE EXTERIOR OF A PROPELLANT TANK. THE PRESENCE OF LIQUID ADHERED TO THE INNER TANK WALL  MASS-LOADS  THE TANK AND THEREBY MODIFIES ITS RESONANT MODE FREQUENCIES. USING A REALTIME MODAL ANALYSIS IMPLEMENTATION  THE MPG TECHNOLOGY CAN TRANSLATE THESE MODAL SHIFTS INTO ESTIMATES OF CONTAINED LIQUID MASS  PROVIDING A  FUEL GAUGE  THAT REQUIRES NO INTERNAL HARDWARE OR TANK MODIFICATIONS  OPERATES IN REAL-TIME  AND ADDS LITTLE MASS TO TANK SYSTEMS. THE INTEGRATION OF ACTIVE SLOSH SUPPRESSION INTO THE MPG ARCHITECTURES PROMISES TO ADDRESS A KEY NASA TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP GOAL OF INSPACE PROPELLANT GAUGING OF UNSETTLED (SLOSHING) PROPELLANT WITH AN ACCURACY OF AT LEAST 2%. WITH CURRENT PROPELLANT MARGINS OF 10% OR MORE REQUIRE TO ACCOMMODATE UNCERTAINTIES IN GAUGING  THE MASC EFFORT REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT ACROSS COMMERCIAL SPACE INDUSTRIES WHILE PROVIDING ENHANCED MISSION FLEXIBILITY. IF MASC CAN BE DEMONSTRATED TO SCALE WELL TO LAUNCH VEHICLES  THE INCREASED SAFETY MARGINS AFFORDED BY REDUCED PROBABILITY OF SLOSH-INDUCED INSTABILITIES WILL BE OF SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO COMMERCIAL LAUNCH PROVIDERS AND TO THE SLS/ORION PROGRAM.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ff57dabd-845d-702c-429d-c46fc5cd9a79-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80NSSC18K1656_8000"}, {"internal_id": 69948897, "Award ID": "80NSSC18K1579", "Award Amount": 2427620.74, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-09-25", "CFDA Number": "43.012", "Description": "THE CUBESAT LASER INFRARED CROSSLINK MISSION WILL IMPROVE CROSSLINK COMMUNICATION DATA RATES FOR CUBESATS TO ENABLE NASA MISSIONS THAT INVOLVE CONSTELLATIONS OR SWARMS OF CUBESATS.

UNLIKE CONVENTIONAL CELLS THAT USE LIQUID ELECTROLYTES WHICH SUFFER FROM LARGELY REDUCED IONIC CONDUCTIVITY (<-30 OC) AND INCREASED SURFACE RESISTANCE  OUR PROPOSED CELLS WILL ADOPT HYDROFLUOROCARBON GAS ELECTROLYTES THAT ARE LIQUEFIED AT AMBIENT PRESSURE. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED WORK INCLUDE: (1) TO DESIGN AND SYNTHESIZE ELECTROCHEMICALLY STABLE POROUS HOSTS (ELECTROLYTE AND ELECTRODES) FOR HYDROFLUOROCARBON CONDENSATION; (2) TO CONDENSE AND INFILTRATE GAS MOLECULES INTO THE POROUS HOSTS AT AMBIENT PRESSURE TO PRODUCE HYBRID ELECTROLYTES AND TEST ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; (3) TO MAKE LITHIUM CELLS USING POROUS ELECTROLYTE AND ELECTRODES AND TEST THEIR PERFORMANCE. OUR APPROACH IS BASED ON CAPILLARY CONDENSATION OF HYDROFLUOROCARBON GAS MOLECULES IN NANOPOROUS STRUCTURES AT AMBIENT PRESSURE. IT HAS BEEN RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED THAT LIQUEFIED HYDROFLUOROCARBON GAS MOLECULES (E.G.  FLUOROMETHANE) HAVE LARGE ELECTROCHEMICAL STABILITY WINDOW AND REASONABLY HIGH IONIC CONDUCTIVITY AND CAN FORM IONIC CONDUCTIVE ELECTROLYTE/ELECTRODE INTERFACE AT EXTREME LOW TEMPERATURE (-78 OC)  ENABLING HIGH PERFORMANCE LITHIUM CELLS. HOWEVER  LIQUEFICATION OF SUCH GAS MOLECULES NEEDS TO OVERCOME LARGE VAPOR PRESSURE (0.79-3.41 MPA)  ABOUT 10 TIMES OF AMBIENT PRESSURE. THEREFORE  THESE HYDROFLUOROCARBON SOLVENTS NEED SPECIAL HANDLING TO FABRICATE CELLS AND PREVENT LEAKAGE  WHICH PLACES POTENTIAL CHALLENGE IN REAL APPLICATIONS. TO LIQUEFY HYDROFLUOROCARBON MOLECULES UNDER AMBIENT PRESSURE WILL ENABLE FABRICATION OF LITHIUM CELLS USING GASEOUS SOLVENT LIKE THE WAY FOR CONVENTIONAL LIQUID CELLS. THE KEY IS TO CONDENSE GAS MOLECULES AT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED VAPOR PRESSURE. THE KELVIN EQUATION SUGGESTS THAT IN A POROUS MEDIUM  CAPILLARY CONDENSATION WILL ALWAYS OCCUR. THE SMALLER THE PORE DIAMETER  THE LOWER THE EQUILIBRIUM VAPOR PRESSURE NEEDED TO CONDENSE GAS MOLECULES. BOTH SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OPERATING PRESSURE TO CONDENSE NITROGEN IN POROUS CARBON REDUCES BY>10 TIMES AS PORE SIZE DECREASES FROM 7 TO 1 NM. SIMILAR TREND HAS ALSO BEEN OBSERVED FOR METHANE. WHILE CAPILLARY CONDENSATION OF HYDROFLUOROCARBON HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY STUDIED YET  BY APPLYING SIMILAR PRINCIPLE  WE EXPECT THAT THE OPERATING PRESSURE REQUIRED TO CONDENSE HYDROFLUOROCARBON WILL BE REDUCED TO 0.08-0.34 MPA  APPROACHING AMBIENT PRESSURE. THE KEY IS TO CREATE POROUS STRUCTURES THAT CAN HOST THESE MOLECULES AND MAINTAIN ELECTROCHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL STABILITY IN CELLS. THE MOST PROMISING POROUS STRUCTURES NEED TO HAVE SUB-10 NM PORES TO ALLOW A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OPERATING VAPOR PRESSURE COMPARED WITH NORMAL CONDITIONS. THE FOCUS OF SUCH MATERIALS INCLUDES MESOPOROUS SILICA  ZEOLITES AND METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS. BESIDES HAVING SMALL PORES (0.5~10 NM)  THESE MATERIALS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN EITHER USED AS ELECTROLYTE ADDITIVE OR AS THE HOST FOR LIQUID ELECTROLYTES  CONFIRMING THEIR COMPATIBILITY WITH LITHIUM CHEMISTRY. NANOPOROUS ELECTRODES (E.G. MNO2  LICOO2 SNO2) CAN BE ALSO DEVELOPED IN THE PI'S LAB USING ESTABLISHED METHODS.

IN ADDITION  METALLIC LI-PLATING ON THE GRAPHITE ANODE SURFACE AT LOW-TEMPERATURES CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS. THEREFORE  THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE THE LOW-TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE BY MODIFYING THE STRUCTURE OF THE GRAPHITE ANODES.

WHEN A BULK LAYERED GRAPHITE IS EXFOLIATED INTO 2D GRAPHENE  THE DIFFUSION-CONTROLLED INTERCALATION MECHANISM BECOMES INACTIVE WHILE THE SURFACE-CONTROLLED CAPACITIVE CHARGE STORAGE MECHANISM APPEARS.

THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING LITHIUM METAL ANODES FOR USE AT TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS -80 DEGREES C  WHICH WILL ENABLE THE CREATION OF RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES WITH HIGHER ENERGY DENSITY AND SPECIFIC ENERGY SUITABLE FOR USE IN SPACE APPLICATIONS. CONVENTIONAL LI-ION BATTERIES CANNOT BE USED EFFICIENTLY AT TEMPERATURES BELOW ~ -20 TO -30 DEGREES C DUE TO KINETICS LIMITATIONS ARISING FROM DIFFUSION WITHIN ELECTRODE MATERIALS AND INTERFACE RESISTANCE. WHILE RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS HAVE YIELDED ELECTROLYTES WITH SUFFICIENT IONIC CONDUCTIVITY AT LOW TEMPERATURES  THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRODE MATERIALS SUITABLE FOR OPERATION AT TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS -80 DEGREES C HAS LAGGED BEHIND. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO UNDERSTAND AND CONTROL THE MORPHOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS  INTERFACIAL EVOLUTION  AND ELECTROCHEMICAL KINETICS OF HIGH-CAPACITY LI METAL ELECTRODES OPERATING AT LOW TEMPERATURES IN RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES. THE LI METAL ELECTRODE IS THE FOCUS OF THIS STUDY FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST  THIS MATERIAL IS HYPOTHESIZED TO EXHIBIT FASTER KINETICS THAN INTERCALATION-TYPE LI-ION BATTERY MATERIALS AT LOW TEMPERATURES DUE TO FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN THE ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTION MECHANISMS AT PLAY.

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY IMPLEMENTABLE GUIDANCE APPROACH THAT OPTIMIZES THE END-TO-END COMPLETE ENTRY  POWERED DESCENT  AND LANDING (EDL) TRAJECTORIES IN REAL-TIME TO ACHIEVE THE FUEL-OPTIMAL AND PRECISE LANDING. IN PURSUIT OF THIS GOAL  THREE ESSENTIAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES WILL BE INVESTIGATED  INCLUDING (1) DEVELOPING HIGH FIDELITY AND COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT MISSION MODELS WITH BOTH CONVENTIONAL BANK-ANGLE CONTROL AND DIRECT-FORCE CONTROL MANEUVERS FOR ENTRY FLIGHT  (2) DESIGNING A FAST CONVERGING ONLINE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM BASED ON ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES  AND (3) CONDUCTING VIRTUAL SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION  WHICH WILL JOINTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANCES OF FUEL-OPTIMAL ENTRY AND DESCENT GUIDANCE ALGORITHMS TO ENABLE PRECISE LANDING. THE END-TO-END ONBOARD OPTIMAL MISSION PLANNING IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO SOLVE MULTIPHASE GUIDANCE PROBLEMS AS AN ENTIRE MISSION BASED ON A ROBUST AND SCALABLE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM.

ILS ARE NONFLAMMABLE SOLVENTS THAT ARE COMPOSED SOLELY OF IONS. CURRENT STATE OF THE ART MATERIALS INCLUDING ZEOLITE OR SILICA GEL ADSORBATES AND AMINE-BASED ABSORBERS FOR CO2 SCRUBBING IN SPACECRAFT AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION PRESENT CHALLENGES WHICH ILS CAN MITIGATE. SPECIFICALLY ILS HAVE THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES: (I) FREE OF DUST AND CONTAINMENT IMPACT DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS  (II) NEGLIGIBLE VOLATILITY HENCE LACK OF ODOR AND INHALATION HAZARDS  (III) TAILORABLE BINDING ENERGY WITH CO2  AND (IV) TUNABLE ABSORPTION CAPACITY WITH RESPECT TO PARTIAL PRESSURE OF CO2. FURTHERMORE  A CO2 REMOVAL SYSTEM BASED ON ILS CAN BE EASILY ADAPTED FOR POST-PROCESSING OF CO2 BY ELECTROCHEMICAL MEANS WHERE ILS CAN ALSO SERVE AS THE ELECTROLYTE. IN MICROGRAVITY  CONTAINMENT OF ILS IS NECESSARY WHILE ENSURING STABLE AIR/LIQUID AND SOLID/LIQUID INTERFACES OVER A LARGE SURFACE AREA. TO ADDRESS THESE REQUIREMENTS  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH CONFINES ILS INTO A SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANE THAT IS MADE OF POLY(IONIC LIQUID) (PIL). COULOMBIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PIL AND IL WILL STABILIZE THE SOLID-IL INTERFACE AND PREVENT LEAKAGE OF THE IL OUT OF THE MEMBRANE. PIL-IL FACILITATES TRANSPORT OF CO2 ACROSS THE MEMBRANE DUE TO THE CO2-AFFINITY AND SELECTIVITY OF THE IL WHILE IT IS IMPERMEABLE TO OTHER GASES.

TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE  WE PROPOSE A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR MODELLING  TRAJECTORY DESIGN  AND CONTROL THAT EXPLICITLY DEALS WITH UNCERTAINTY AT EVERY STAGE IN THE PROCESS TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY. MOST ENTRY GUIDANCE METHODS USED IN PRACTICE ARE BASED ON APOLLO-HERITAGE BANK-ANGLE CONTROL. WHILE SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE  THESE METHODS TYPICALLY RESULT IN POSITION ERRORS OF MANY KILOMETERS.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNCTIONS AND PAYLOADS BETWEEN MULTIPLE COOPERATIVE SATELLITES ALLOWS US TO ACCOMPLISH TECHNOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH A MONOLITHIC SYSTEM. HOWEVER  THE USE OF MULTIPLE SATELLITES INTRODUCES MORE STRICT REQUIREMENTS ON GUIDANCE  NAVIGATION  AND CONTROL (GN&C) ALGORITHMS  ESPECIALLY MANEUVER PLANNING ALGORITHMS. INSTEAD OF THE NEED TO CONTROL THE ABSOLUTE MOTION OF A SINGLE SATELLITE  WE MUST EFFICIENTLY CONTROL THE RELATIVE MOTION OF MULTIPLE SATELLITES IN A FORMATION TO MAINTAIN OR RECONFIGURE THE SATELLITES' POSITIONS. THEREFORE  ACCURATE AND ROBUST CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT RELATIVE MOTION IS ESSENTIAL TO ENABLING AUTONOMOUS RECONFIGURATION OF SPACECRAFT IN FUTURE MULTI-SATELLITE MISSIONS. THE PROPOSED WORK AIMS TO DEVELOP AN AUTONOMOUS IMPULSIVE MANEUVER PLANNER FOR RELATIVE ORBIT RECONFIGURATION THAT CAN HANDLE AN ARBITRARY ORBIT SCENARIO IN A COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT WAY  AND TO INCORPORATE THESE ALGORITHMS INTO ON-BOARD MICROPROCESSORS. THE RELATIVE STATE WILL BE PARAMETERIZED USING RELATIVE ORBITAL ELEMENTS  OR ROE  WHICH PROVIDE GEOMETRIC INTUITION INTO THE SIX-DIMENSIONAL SPACE AND GIVE RISE TO SIMPLER SOLUTIONS TO THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM. THOUGH CLOSED-FORM SOLUTIONS ARE IDEAL FOR IMPLEMENTATION ON SPACEBORNE MICROPROCESSORS  IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THAT CLOSED-FORM SOLUTIONS WILL EXIST FOR NON-ZERO ECCENTRICITY ORBITS INCLUDING PERTURBATIONS. THEREFORE  I PLAN TO INSTEAD DEVELOP A NUMERICAL SOLVER THAT EXPLOITS THE GEOMETRIC KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE ABOUT THE SIXDIMENSIONAL ROE SPACE AND USES THE HIGH-FIDELITY DYNAMICS MODELS DEVELOPED IN STANFORD'S SPACE RENDEZVOUS LABORATORY (SLAB). THESE SOLUTIONS MUST BE ROBUST ENOUGH TO PROVIDE FUEL-OPTIMALITY IN PERTURBED ORBITS OF ARBITRARY ECCENTRICITY  WHILE CONSIDERING PERTURBATIONS (EARTH'S OBLATENESS  DIFFERENTIAL DRAG  SOLAR RADIATION PRESSURE  AND THIRD BODY) AND TIME AND SPACE CONSTRAINTS (FOR SAFE SEPARATION  FORBIDDEN REGIONS). A PERTURBATION ANALYSIS WILL BE PERFORMED TO ASSESS WHETHER DYNAMICS CAN BE SIMPLIFIED IN SOME ORBIT REGIMES  AND THEN THE NEXT STEP IS TO USE THE IMPROVED DYNAMICS MODELS DEVELOPED IN SLAB  DEPENDING ON EACH PERTURBATION SOURCE'S RELEVANCE IN A GIVEN RECONFIGURATION SCENARIO. IN ADDITION  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT UNCERTAINTY IN DYNAMICS  STATE REPRESENTATION  AND MANEUVER EXECUTION TIMES ARE ASSESSED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MANEUVER PLANNING ALGORITHMS. TO TEST THE ALGORITHMS' ROBUSTNESS TO UNCERTAINTY  INITIAL STATE ESTIMATES WILL BE CORRUPTED WITH ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART GN&C SYSTEMS. THE EFFECT OF UNCERTAINTIES WILL BECOME APPARENT ESPECIALLY IN TESTING WITH HARDWARE IN THE LOOP  AND CAN CAUSE PROPAGATION OF ERRORS THAT REDUCE THE ACCURACY OF THE MANEUVER SCHEMES. FURTHERMORE  WITH NASA'S GROWING CURIOSITY IN STUDYING NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS (NEOS)  IT IS OF INTEREST TO EXTEND THE IMPULSIVE MANEUVER PLANNING ALGORITHMS TO ORBIT REGIMES AROUND SMALL CELESTIAL OBJECTS THAT MAY BE HIGHLY IRREGULAR IN BOTH SHAPE AND GRAVITATIONAL FIELD. ONCE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF CLOSED-FORM CONTROL AND GUIDANCE SOLUTIONS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED  THEY MUST BE PACKAGED INTO A SINGLE AUTONOMOUS MANEUVER PLANNING SOFTWARE AND VALIDATED IN A HIGH-FIDELITY  HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP TESTING ENVIRONMENT AND SIMULATED WITH A FULL-FORCE DYNAMICS MODEL. FIRST  THE ACCURACY OF THE SOLUTIONS WILL BE COMPARED TO A TRUTH MODEL  WHICH IS A NUMERICAL INTEGRATION OF THE NONLINEAR EQUATIONS OF MOTION  INCLUDING A FULL FORCE MODEL OF THE DYNAMICS AND PERTURBATIONS AND REALISTIC UNCERTAINTIES AS THE SOFTWARE WOULD EXPERIENCE IN FLIGHT.

AS A RESULT  THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF MY RESEARCH IS THAT ITS FOCUS IS ON DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR DESIGNING SMART STRUCTURES WITH COMBINATIONS OF DISTRIBUTED ACTUATORS  LIKE PIEZOELECTRICS  AND KINEMATIC ACTUATORS TO ACHIEVE ROBUST STRUCTURAL CONTROL.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "74bac010-0a24-8f82-8021-0fa16ab4bc6d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80NSSC18K1177_8000"}, {"internal_id": 67313026, "Award ID": "80NSSC18K1176", "Award Amount": 258576.98, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-06-25", "CFDA Number": "43.012", "Description": "THIS WORK WILL DEVELOP THE GUIDANCE AND CONTROL ALGORITHMS NECESSARY FOR REAL-TIME MANEUVER PLANNING AND EXECUTION FOR SPACECRAFT FORMATIONS USING LOW-THRUST CONTROL  IN LINE WITH THE GOALS OF TA 5.4.2 ONBOARD AUTO NAVIGATION AND MANEUVER AND TA 5.4.5 AUTONOMOUS PRECISION FORMATION FLYING. IT LIES AT THE INTERSECTION OF THREE TECHNOLOGIES CRUCIAL FOR FUTURE MISSIONS. FORMATION FLYING IS NEEDED TO ENABLE MISSIONS WHICH REQUIRE LARGE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND THUS PRECLUDE THE USE OF MONOLITHIC PLATFORMS. ELECTRIC PROPULSION WILL INCREASE THE LIFESPAN AND CAPABILITY OF MISSIONS BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT BY REDUCING PROPELLANT MASS. AUTONOMY IS ESSENTIAL FOR MISSIONS TO OTHER PLANETS IN WHICH COMMUNICATION TO EARTH IS SLOW AND COSTLY  AND IS MADE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING BY THE LIMITED PROCESSING SPEED OF FLIGHT HARDWARE. TO FUSE THESE TECHNOLOGIES WHILE ENSURING ROBUSTNESS AND EFFICIENCY  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RELATIVE ORBITAL ELEMENTS (ROE)  AN EMERGING PARADIGM FOR RELATIVE STATE REPRESENTATION WHICH REPLACES RAPIDLY VARYING AND GEOMETRICALLY OPAQUE STATE VECTORS WITH SLOWLY VARYING  PHYSICALLY SIGNIFICANT PARAMETERS. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES LIE ALONG THREE CLOSELY-RELATED BUT INDEPENDENT PATHS. FIRST IS THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF EXISTING ROE THEORY TO THE PROBLEM OF LOW-THRUST FORMATION FLYING. IMPORTANT FOCUSES ARE THE GENERALIZATION OF THE SHORTEST-PATH IMPULSIVE CONTROL SCHEME TO CONTINUOUS  LOW-THRUST CONTROL AND DETERMINATION OF DELTA-V LOWER BOUNDS IN THAT CONTEXT. THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT WILL BE EFFICIENT NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS FOR OPTIMAL LOW-THRUST FORMATION CONTROL AROUND A CENTRAL BODY WITH PERTURBATIONS FROM OBLATENESS  DRAG  SOLAR RADIATION PRESSURE  THIRD BODIES  ETC. SECOND IS EXTENSION OF THE GENERIC ROE FRAMEWORK TO STRONGLY PERTURBED ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS SMALL BODIES AND LIBRATION POINTS. THIS WILL DRAW ON THE FACT THAT THE ROE ARE INTEGRATION CONSTANTS OF THE EQUATIONS OF RELATIVE MOTION. THE ADVANTAGES OF ROE MAY BE OBTAINED IN RELATED PROBLEMS BY CONSIDERING THE INTEGRATION CONSTANTS OF A MINIMALLY-REDUCED DYNAMICS MODEL. APPLICATIONS OF INTEREST INCLUDE THE NEW WORLDS OBSERVER TELESCOPE FORMATION CONCEPT AROUND SUN-EARTH L2  PROXIMITY OPERATIONS AND SERVICING IN CIS-LUNAR SPACE IN SUPPORT OF MANNED LUNAR MISSIONS  AND GRAVITY RECOVERY OF ASTEROIDS AND NATURAL SATELLITES. LAST IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW-THRUST TESTBED IN STANFORD'S SPACE RENDEZVOUS LABORATORY (SLAB) FOR VALIDATION OF GNC ALGORITHMS THROUGH HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP TESTING. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A THERMAL VACUUM CHAMBER FACILITY FOR OPERATING CUBESAT ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEMS WILL SUPPORT SLAB   S HIGH-FIDELITY VALIDATION ENVIRONMENT. THE COMBINED ELEMENTS OF SLAB   S TESTING ENVIRONMENT WILL ENABLE RAPID TESTING OF GNC SUBSYSTEMS ON SPACE-CAPABLE COMPONENTS  INCLUDING SENSORS  PROCESSORS  ACTUATORS  AND ASSOCIATED ALGORITHMS. VISITING TECHNOLOGIST EXPERIENCES WILL FACILITATE EXCHANGE OF TESTING PRACTICES AND SHARING OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT A BROADER RANGE OF MISSIONS. THIS PROJECT CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE OF THE ART IN PRECISION FORMATION FLYING AND ONBOARD GUIDANCE AND CONTROL BY PROVIDING A DIRECT PATH FROM THEORETICAL ADVANCES  THROUGH ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT  AND FINALLY TO IMPLEMENTATION AND VALIDATION IN SATELLITE HARDWARE. BY SYSTEMATICALLY INCREASING THE TRL OF GNC ALGORITHMS FOR LOW-THRUST FORMATION FLYING  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ENABLE A HOST OF FUTURE MISSIONS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF ORBITAL REGIMES.

FURTHERMORE  STRUCTURAL  SENSING  AND ACTUATION CAPABILITIES WILL BE INTEGRATED THROUGH THE DESIGN OF METAMATERIAL SHEETS (I.E.  SHEETS WITH AN ENGINEERED ARCHITECTURE THAT CONVEYS PROPERTIES NOT USUALLY FOUND IN NATURE). THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTISTABLE ORIGAMI STRUCTURES  COMPOSED OF SMART AND RESPONSIVE MATERIALS WILL ENABLE TUNING THE MORPHOLOGY OF SURFACES IN RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI (E.G.  TEMPERATURE OR PRESSURE CHANGES  LIGHT  ETC). THE FINAL GOAL WILL BE THE ABILITY TO CREATE AUTONOMOUS  MORPHING SPACE STRUCTURES WITH INTRINSIC CONTROL OF THE STRUCTURAL FRAME AND ITS PRE-PROGRAMMABLE DEPLOYABILITY. WITH THESE ADVANCEMENTS IN PLACE  FOR EXAMPLE  LARGE DEFORMABLE MIRRORS AND LENSES COULD BE POINTED IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OR UNDERGO PRECISE CHANGES IN FOCAL LENGTH. IT COULD BE POSSIBLE TO STEER SOLAR SAILS IN THE ABSENCE OF ELECTRICAL CONTROLLERS  OR CAUSE EXPANDABLE HABITATS TO SPRING INTO SHAPE. THE TA 12 TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP STATES THAT THESE APPLICATIONS WOULD BENEFIT FROM FURTHER SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. THE COMBINATION OF ORIGAMI AND SMART METAMATERIALS COULD ALSO BE APPLIED TO THE DESIGN OF SMALL  CUBE SATELLITES THAT UNDERGO SHAPE CHANGES IN ORDER TO DISPENSE A PAYLOAD. THE MULTI-FUNCTIONAL NATURE OF THE METAMATERIALS WOULD ALSO PROVIDE CONSIDERABLE MASS AND VOLUME SAVINGS. SINCE CHANGING THE SHAPE OF A STRUCTURE CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN ITS MECHANICAL PROPERTIES  THE MECHANICAL RESPONSE TO STATIC AND DYNAMIC LOADS (SUCH AS IMPACTS AND VIBRATIONS) COULD BE TUNED TO PERFORM DIFFERENTLY UNDER VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD DESIGNING SPACE STRUCTURES OF THIS NATURE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE THE KINEMATIC BEHAVIOR OF MULTISTABLE ORIGAMI STRUCTURES: TO DEVELOP \"SHAPE-MORPHING BUILDING BLOCKS\" THAT CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN PRECISE SURFACE CURVATURES FROM A MODULAR DESIGN APPROACH; AND TO LEARN HOW TO EMBED CONSTRAINTS INTO THE ORIGAMI CREASE PATTERNS IN ORDER TO ENABLE SNAPTHROUGH BEHAVIOR BETWEEN STABLE STATES. MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT TESSELLATIONS (I.E.  TILINGS) OF DIFFERENT  MULTISTABLE UNIT CELLS ARE THE KEY TO OBTAINING THIS BEHAVIOR. BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE LOCAL KINEMATIC CONSTRAINTS (FOR EXAMPLE  SURROUNDING ORIGAMI UNIT CELLS THAT UNDERGO LARGE AREA CHANGES WITH UNIT CELLS THAT CONTRACT LESS)  ARBITRARY OUT-OF-PLANE DISPLACEMENTS CAN BE OBTAINED FROM AN INITIALLY PLANAR  ALBEIT INHOMOGENEOUS  STRUCTURE. THE PROJECT WILL HAVE FOUR MAIN COMPONENTS: (I) COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF ORIGAMI UNIT CELLS; (II) DESKTOP-SCALED EXPERIMENTS IN ACTUATION METHODS IN 3D-PRINTED METAMATERIAL SHEETS; (III) DESIGNING ORIGAMI TESSELLATIONS THAT RESULT IN DESIRED SURFACES WHEN FOLDED; AND (IV) THE FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE TESSELLATED DESIGNS. THE FUNDAMENTAL FINDINGS OBTAINED FROM THE PROJECT WILL GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORPHING STRUCTURES FOR SPECIFIC SPACE APPLICATIONS  SUCH AS THE ONES OUTLINED IN THE NASA TA 12 TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP. ACCORDING TO THE TA 12 ROADMAP  EXISTING SPACE STRUCTURES DO NOT INCORPORATE SENSING AND OTHER FUNCTIONS INTO THEIR STRUCTURE. INSTEAD  THESE FUNCTIONS ARE PROVIDED BY DISCRETE SYSTEMS THAT ARE ADDED ONTO THE STRUCTURE  WHICH INCREASES MASS AND VOLUME.

IT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ROBUST THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR AEROSPACE APPLICATION  ESPECIALLY IN LOW GRAVITY CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE  POOL BOILING IS A COMMON TWO-PHASE HEAT TRANSFER PROCESS BUT RELIES HEAVILY ON BUOYANCY FORCING. WHEN GRAVITY IS REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM  THE CRITICAL HEAT FLUX (CHF) OCCURS AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE AND AT A LOWER HEAT FLUX; BUBBLES THAT FORM AT THE HEAT EXCHANGER SURFACE HAVE NO DRIVING FORCE FOR CONVECTION AND QUICKLY FORM A VAPOR BLANKET THAT PREVENTS LIQUIDSURFACE INTERACTION LEADING TO A MINIMUM HEAT FLUX (MHF). THE PROJECT PROPOSES A NOVEL IDEA WHERE PERIODIC MECHANICAL ACCELERATION OF A HEAT EXCHANGER RESONATES WITH THE SYSTEM S NATURAL FREQUENCY-GENERATING A FLUID INSTABILITY AND VIGOROUS FLOW. THIS INSTABILITY IS KNOWN AS THE FARADAY INSTABILITY. OBSERVATIONS OF FARADAY INSTABILITY BY THE CANDIDATE IN MICROGRAVITY EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE FLOWS ARE CONTROLLED BY INTERFACIAL TENSION AND ARE VERY INTENSE. THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE THE BASIS FOR THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WHERE THE UTILIZATION OF A NEW FLOW MECHANISM WILL ADEQUATELY REPLACE GRAVITY-DRIVEN CONVECTION IN HEAT TRANSFER OPERATIONS IN MICROGRAVITY. THIS  IN TURN  WILL CAUSE AN INCREASE IN THE CHF AND A DELAY IN THE MHF IN MICROGRAVITY AND IN EARTH OPERATIONS WHERE BUOYANCY FORCING IS NEGLIGIBLE COMPARED WITH INTERFACE-DRIVEN FORCING (MICRO-DEVICES). IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE FORCED OSCILLATIONS OF A HEAT TRANSFER FLUID WILL RESONATE WITH THE SYSTEM S NATURAL FREQUENCY AND PRODUCE INTERFACIAL WAVES THAT WILL SUBSEQUENTLY PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL FLOW THAT ENHANCES THE HEAT TRANSFER AND CHF. THE IDEA WILL BE RESEARCHED VIA A THEORETICAL APPROACH FOLLOWED BY EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION AT UF AND AT A NASA FACILITY  PREFERABLY NASA GLENN DUE TO AVAILABLE FLOW BOILING AND CONDENSATION EXPERIMENT (FBCE) DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT. THE THEORETICAL APPROACH INCLUDES THE MODELING OF THE FLOW AND HEAT TRANSFER PROFILES FOR A VERTICALLY OSCILLATING HEAT EXCHANGER. THE EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH WILL VERIFY THE INCREASE IN HEAT FLUX IN A HEAT EXCHANGER FOR BOTH A NON-BOILING AND BOILING LIQUID SYSTEM. VISITS TO NASA LABORATORIES WILL THUS INFORM THE CANDIDATE ON DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS.

ITS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS REFINING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICS OF CNT GROWTH VIA THE FLOATING CATALYST CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (FCCVD) METHOD. THIS WILL SERVE AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE PROCESS EFFICIENCY AND THE QUALITY OF PRODUCED CNTS. SPECIFICALLY  IMPROVEMENTS TO CNT ASPECT RATIO (LENGTH/DIAMETER) AND CRYSTALLINITY ARE DESIRED. ITS SECONDARY OBJECTIVE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF THE FCCVD PROCESS FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS PRODUCTION OF CNTS AND HYDROGEN FROM METHANE. THIS COULD PROVIDE A SCALABLE ALTERNATIVE TO STEAM-METHANE REFORMING FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN FOR USE AS ROCKET PROPELLANT. IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF AVAILABLE CNT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN REALIZING THE PROPERTY MILESTONES LAID OUT IN TA10.2.3.1 AND TA10.1.1.1. THE PROPERTIES OF THESE AND OTHER MACROSCALE APPLICATIONS OF CNTS SCALE WITH THE QUALITY OF THE CNTS USED IN THEIR MANUFACTURING. CURRENT CNT PRODUCTION METHODS REMAIN POORLY CHARACTERIZED FROM AN ENGINEERING STANDPOINT. THIS HAS RESULTED IN AN INABILITY TO COMMERCIALLY PRODUCE CNTS THAT ALLOW MACROSCALE APPLICATIONS TO REACH ANY SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THE PROPERTIES OF INDIVIDUAL CNTS. THE FCCVD PROCESS IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING METHODS TO GROW CNTS IN A MANNER SUITABLE FOR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION  BUT MORE STUDIES OF INTERNAL PROCESSES LIKE REACTION KINETICS AND HEAT AND MASS TRANSPORT PHENOMENA ARE NEEDED. THE FCCVD PROCESS CAN BE OPERATED WITH A VARIETY OF HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCKS  INCLUDING METHANE. THE RESULT IS SOLID CARBON IN THE FORM OF CNTS AND HYDROGEN GAS  WHICH MAY EASILY BE COLLECTED AND USED AS FUEL. THIS HYDROGEN HAS  UP UNTIL RECENTLY  BEEN LARGELY IGNORED AS BYPRODUCT OF THE REACTION. CREATING A PROCESS OPTIMIZED FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS PRODUCTION OF CNTS AND HYDROGEN WILL BUILD UPON AND GO BEYOND THE STUDIES PROPOSED IN THE PURSUIT OF THE PRIMARY GOAL. A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO STUDY INTERNAL PROCESSES OF FCCVD AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE PRODUCED CNTS. THE HIGH TEMPERATURES USED IN FCCVD WILL NECESSITATE A COMBINATION OF IN SITU CONDITION MEASUREMENTS AND SAMPLE COLLECTION  MODEL EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS  AND FINITE ELEMENT MODELING TO BUILD A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESS INTERNALS.

THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON NASAS OBJECTIVES IN THE STR TABS: SPECIFICALLY  WITHIN SPACE POWER&ENERGY STORAGE (TA03)  POWER GENERATION (3.1)  SOLAR (3.1.3). THROUGH ADDRESSING OUTSTANDING CHALLENGES OF MONOLITHIC INTEGRATION OF III-V ON SI  I AIM TO DEMONSTRATE A III-V WITH SI TANDEM SOLAR CELL WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY. HIGH SPECIFIC POWER AND LOW COST ARE CRUCIAL FOR ENABLING A GREATER VARIETY OF SPACE MISSIONS AND FOR INCREASING THE COST COMPETITIVENESS OF SOLAR ENERGY IN THE GLOBAL MARKET. THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE INVESTMENTS IN SPACE SOLAR TECHNOLOGY TO BENEFIT TERRESTRIAL POWER GENERATION AND VICE VERSA IS ONE OF THE GREAT STRENGTHS OF III-V ON SI TANDEMS. SI SINGLE-JUNCTION (1J) CELLS HAVE DOMINATED THE TERRESTRIAL SOLAR MARKET DUE TO LOW MATERIAL COST AND HIGH 1J EFFICIENCY  BUT LITTLE ROOM REMAINS FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TOWARD ITS THEORETICAL EFFICIENCY LIMIT. III-V MULTI-JUNCTION (MJ) CELLS ACHIEVE MUCH HIGHER EFFICIENCIES THROUGH TAILORING BANDGAPS OF SUBCELLS  BUT ARE HINDERED BY SMALL-DIAMETER  HIGH-COST III-V SUBSTRATES. THROUGH MONOLITHIC INTEGRATION OF III-VS WITH SI  THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COST OF III-V MJ CELLS AND TO REALIZE COMPETITIVE  HIGH-EFFICIENCY CELLS FOR BOTH SPACE AND TERRESTRIAL POWER. MY PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON THE MONOLITHIC INTEGRATION OF ~1.7EV GAASP ON SI THROUGH METAMORPHIC BUFFERS. METAMORPHIC GROWTH GRADUALLY RELAXES LATTICE MISMATCH IN BUFFER LAYERS BY CONCENTRATING DEFECT NUCLEATION OUTSIDE THE ACTIVE SOLAR CELL LAYERS. IN OUR EXPERIMENTS WE HAVE FOUND THAT RELAXED GAP ON SI CAN POSSESS NEARLY THE SAME THREADING DISLOCATION DENSITY (TDD) AS RELAXED GAASP ON SI  WHICH IS A REMARKABLE GIVEN THAT THE LATTICE MISMATCH OF GAASP ON SI IS>6X HIGHER THAN GAP ON SI. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THEREFORE TO UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION OF THREADING DISLOCATIONS AS A FUNCTION OF THICKNESS AND COMPOSITION THROUGH MULTIPLE CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES AND TO OPTIMIZE GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR REDUCED TDD. FOR METAMORPHIC SOLAR CELLS  THREADING DISLOCATIONS ARE TYPICALLY THOUGHT OF AS THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTOR TO REDUCED EFFICIENCY. HOWEVER  WE HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT POINT DEFECTS PLAY AN INCREASING ROLE IN LIMITING GAASP DEVICE PERFORMANCE AS TDD DECREASES.

EACH OBJECTIVE HAS RESEARCH GOALS IN BOTH FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS FOR SPACE MISSIONS. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO PHYSICALLY MODEL THE PROCESSES AND MATERIAL PROPERTIES NEEDED FOR THE DESIGN OF A SYSTEM USING CONCENTRATED SUNLIGHT TO 3D PRINT REGOLITH IN A SIMULATED EXTRAPLANETARY ENVIRONMENT. INDUSTRIAL 3D PRINTING IS OFTEN ACCOMPLISHED ON EARTH BY SINTERING POWDER PARTICLES TOGETHER USING A LASER. MANY CLASSES OF MATERIALS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY SINTERED INCLUDING PLASTICS  METALS  AND CERAMICS. COLLECTED SUNLIGHT USES THE SAME FUNDAMENTAL PROCESS OF APPLYING HIGH ENERGY TO A SMALL AREA OF PARTICLES  SINTERING THEM TOGETHER  SCANNING ACROSS A SURFACE TO MAKE A SINTERED PARTICLE LAYER  AND REPEATING THE PROCESS BY LAYERS UNTIL A PART IS COMPLETE. PHYSICAL MODELS OF THESE PROCESSES HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY FOR LASER SYSTEMS WITH REGULATED GRAIN SIZES AND SURFACE CONDITIONS  BUT THERE IS NO MODEL FOR SUCH A SYSTEM USING SUNLIGHT OR UNSIEVED REGOLITH. THE MODELING WILL ENTAIL THE USE OF OPTICAL DESIGN SOFTWARE SUCH AS ZEMAX FOR RAY TRACING AND THERMO-MECHANICAL MODELING IN SOFTWARE SUCH AS ABAQUS. MODELS WILL BE COMPARED WITH PRACTICAL TEST RESULTS TO EVALUATE THEIR UTILITY FOR FUNDAMENTAL MATERIAL SCIENCE AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM DESIGN. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP SUCH A SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM WILL CONSIST OF A LIGHT SOURCE  A COLLECTING LENS  A POSITIONING SYSTEM  AND A REGOLITH SPREADER. PARTS WILL BE PRODUCED ON THIS SYSTEM FIRST IN OPEN AIR  THEN UNDER PARTIAL OR FULL VACUUM AND THE ELECTROSTATIC CONDITIONS OF PLANETARY BODIES WITHOUT RADIATION BELTS. THE THIRD OBJECTIVE IS TO USE MODERN  NON-DESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION TECHNIQUES ON PARTS PRODUCED BY THE SYSTEM TO OPTIMIZE THE PRINTING PROCESS AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TECHNOLOGY WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER  BETTER UNDERSTOOD TECHNIQUES PROPOSED FOR USE IN SPACE RESOURCE UTILIZATION MISSIONS. THESE TECHNIQUES MAY INCLUDE INFRARED IMAGING DURING THE PRINTING PROCESS  X-RAY ANALYSIS OF GRAIN STRUCTURE  ULTRASONIC MEASUREMENT OF VOIDS  OR A NUMBER OF OTHER AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES AT THE COLORADO SCHOOL OF MINES. RESEARCH METHODS THE PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET WITH AN ITERATIVE PROCESS: A COMPUTER MODEL WILL BE DEVELOPED  A PROTOTYPE WILL PRODUCE PARTS  THE PARTS WILL BE EVALUATED  AND THE MODEL AND PROTOTYPE WILL BE ADJUSTED TO ALIGN TEST RESULTS WITH DESIRED OUTCOMES. THOUGH THE MODELING IS ALLOCATED TIME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS  CONTINUAL UPDATING OF THE COMPUTER MODEL WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO BOTH SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING AND QUALITY CONTROL. THERE IS EXPERTISE AT THE COLORADO SCHOOL OF MINES IN COLLECTED SOLAR RADIATION  OPTICAL MINING  SIMULATED EXTRAPLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS  ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING  AND REGOLITH GEOPHYSICS. ALL WORK WILL BE PERFORMED BY THE STUDENT  BUT THESE RESOURCES WILL BE UTILIZED TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANT UNANSWERED QUESTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS PROPOSAL. SIGNIFICANCE THOUGH CONCENTRATED SOLAR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING HAS OFTEN BEEN SUGGESTED FOR SPACE MANUFACTURING AND EXPLORATION  VERY LITTLE FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE OR ENGINEERING HAS BEEN DONE ON IT TO DATE. PHYSICAL MODELING OF GRANULAR BEHAVIOR  THERMAL PROCESSES  AND BULK MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF REGOLITH SINTERED IN A REALISTIC ENVIRONMENT WILL BE VALUABLE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS ANY MANUFACTURING ON MARS OR THE MOON. THOUGH CONCENTRATED SOLAR PRINTING SYSTEMS BY NATURE WILL HAVE FEW MOVING PARTS  THE OPTICAL DESIGN AND PROCESS PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION NECESSARY TO PRODUCE A WORKING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DONE. THE RESULTS OF THIS GRANT COULD BE IMMEDIATELY USEFUL IN PLANNING RESOURCE UTILIZATION MISSIONS FOR THE NEXT DECADE.

THE SHOCK TUBE WILL BE FILLED WITH DIFFERENT GASSES FOUND ON MARS (FOR EXAMPLE CO2  CO  AR)  AND ULTIMATELY WITH A SIMULATED MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE (INCLUDING TRACE AMOUNTS OF OTHER GASSES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE RATIOS ON MARS). THE SHOCK TUBE WILL GENERATE A MOVING SHOCK THAT TRAVELS DOWN THE TUBE THROUGH THE TEST SECTION AND REFLECTS OFF OF THE WALL. THIS SHOCK REFLECTION GENERATES HIGH TEMPERATURES  AND THIS IS WHERE THE HEAT TRANSFER PROPERTIES OF THE GAS MIXTURE CAN BE OBSERVED. THE REGION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE GAS WILL BE PROBED USING LASER SPECTROSCOPY AND THE DATA COLLECTED WILL BE USED TO CREATE A THERMODYNAMIC NON-EQUILIBRIUM KINETIC MODEL THAT WILL CAPTURE THE RATES OF ENERGY TRANSFER.

FIRST  I WILL GENETICALLY ENGINEER A PLANT VIRUS TO DISPLAY PROTEINS CAPABLE OF BINDING TO ANTIBODIES OR FC-FUSION PROTEIN PHARMACEUTICALS  WHICH ACCOUNT FOR OVER 50% OF ALL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL SALES  AND THEN PRODUCE HIGH QUANTITIES OF THESE VIRUS-BASED IMMUNOSORBENT NANOPARTICLES (VINS) IN INEDIBLE PLANT BIOMASS. SECOND  I WILL TAKE THESE VINS AND IMMOBILIZE THEM IN A 3D BIOPRINTED HYDROGEL MEMBRANE  WHICH I AIM TO HOUSE IN A SIMPLE 3D PRINTED CAPSULE WITH AN INLET AND OUTLET PORT. IMPURE PHARMACEUTICAL STREAMS WILL ENTER THE INLET AND IMPURITIES WILL EXIT THE OUTLET  LEAVING THE PHARMACEUTICAL BOUND TO THE VINS ON THE HYDROGEL MEMBRANE. BY INDUCING A MILDLY ACIDIC ENVIRONMENT  THE PHARMACEUTICAL WILL LOSE BINDING AFFINITY TO THE VINS AND EXIT THE OUTLET PORT  SUFFICIENTLY PURE FOR HUMAN INJECTION. THIRD  I WILL OPTIMIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR IN SITU RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS. KEY EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE: 1) AGROBACTERIUM-MEDIATED INFECTION AND MECHANICAL WOUND VIRAL RNA INFECTION AS COMPARATIVE METHODS FOR VIN PRODUCTION. 2) TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND GOLD-LABELED ANTIBODIES TO TEST THAT I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED FUNCTIONAL VINS. 3) CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TO MORE CLOSELY INVESTIGATE VIN BINDING CAPACITY AND STABILITY LIMITATIONS. 4) GEL ELECTROPHORESIS AND DENSITOMETRY TO PERFORM MASS BALANCES TO INVESTIGATE VIN PRODUCTION LEVEL AND ANTIBODY RECOVERY LOSSES. 5) INDUSTRY-STANDARD PHARMACEUTICAL PURIFICATION PROCESSING (E.G. TANGENTIAL FLOW FILTRATION  CHROMATOGRAPHY) AS A COMPARATIVE CASE TO VIN PURIFICATION. 6) ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAYS TO TEST ACTIVITY LOSS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL AFTER VIN PURIFICATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1e2f11d9-030b-5288-d89f-1f6fd7f111f3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80NSSC18K1157_8000"}, {"internal_id": 67313030, "Award ID": "80NSSC18K1156", "Award Amount": 144513.9, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-06-25", "CFDA Number": "43.012", "Description": "THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT AIMS TO STUDY HEATERLESS HOLLOW CATHODE IGNITION AND DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXTEND LIFETIMES OF IODINE FUELED HOLLOW CATHODES. WHILE MOST MODERN ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEMS OPERATE USING INERT GASSES  THE PROPOSED USE OF IODINE HAS ADVANTAGES IN ITS HIGHER STORAGE DENSITY AND SIMPLIFIED STORAGE REQUIREMENTS. HALL THRUSTERS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PERFORM WELL WHILE OPERATING WITH IODINE  HOWEVER THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH SUCCESS IN OPERATING HOLLOW CATHODES WITH IODINE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. IMPLEMENTING BOTH IODINE AND INERT GAS FEED SYSTEMS IN A SPACECRAFT IS UNDESIRABLE. THEREFORE  IMPROVEMENTS MUST BE MADE TO EXTEND HOLLOW CATHODE LIFETIMES BEFORE IODINE ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEMS CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR SPACEFLIGHT. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT WOULD EXPERIMENTALLY TEST A BROAD VARIETY OF HOLLOW CATHODE DESIGNS USING IODINE IN ORDER TO FIND THE MOST EFFECTIVE CONFIGURATIONS. HEATERLESS HOLLOW CATHODES CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEMS BY REDUCING COMPLEXITY AND INCREASING RELIABILITY. CURRENTLY  HEATERLESS HOLLOW CATHODE DEVELOPMENT IS SUFFERING FROM A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE IGNITION PROCESS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH INCLUDES AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE IGNITION PROCESS OF HEATERLESS HOLLOW CATHODES. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH WOULD BE TO DEVELOP A HEATERLESS HOLLOW CATHODE THAT OPERATES SUCCESSFULLY WITH IODINE. TO ELABORATE ON WHAT WILL BE DONE  TRADITIONALLY CONFIGURED HOLLOW CATHODES WILL BE INVESTIGATED FIRST. THESE HOLLOW CATHODES INCLUDE A CATHODE TUBE THAT CONTAINS A CYLINDRICAL EMITTER AND IS TERMINATED WITH AN ORIFICE PLATE. AFTER CONFIGURATIONS LIKE THIS ARE INVESTIGATED  WE WILL INVESTIGATE CATHODES CONFIGURED IN A PLANAR GEOMETRY. I HAVE DEVELOPED CATHODES THAT ELIMINATE THE CATHODE TUBE BY SIMPLY PLACING A DISC SHAPED EMITTER UPSTREAM OF A KEEPER ORIFICE PLATE. IN THESE CATHODES  THE EMITTER IS MOUNTED TO A THIN SHEET OF REFRACTORY METAL THAT HAS HOLES THAT ALLOW FOR UNRESTRICTED PROPELLANT FLOW TO PASS OVER THE EMITTER REGION AND OUT THROUGH THE KEEPER ORIFICE. THESE PLANAR CATHODES HAVE PERFORMED WELL WHEN RUNNING WITH ARGON AND XENON  AND I BELIEVE THEY WILL PERFORM WELL WITH IODINE. THE PLANAR GEOMETRY ALLOWS US TO INTRODUCE THE IODINE VAPOR THROUGH A STRUCTURE THAT IS AT A MODERATE TEMPERATURE WHICH RESULTS IN MINIMIZED EROSION. BY THERMALLY ISOLATING THE EMITTER ADEQUATELY FROM THE PLANAR CATHODE MOUNT  WE WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE EMITTER AT TEMPERATURES THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO PREVENT IODINE FROM REACTING WITH THE EMITTER MATERIAL.

NON-COHESIVE SOIL POSES ONE OF THE PRIMARY THREATS TO WHEELED ROBOTS  WHICH CAN EASILY BECOME EMBEDDED. NEW SOFT/FRIABLE TERRAIN MOBILITY SYSTEMS ARE NEEDED IF WE ARE TO ACCELERATE THE ROBOTIC EXPLORATION OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. POWER STORAGE AND MASS ARE LIMITED ONBOARD SPACECRAFT  CAUSING COMPETITION BETWEEN MOBILITY  COMPUTING  AND SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT SYSTEMS. THIS NATURALLY LEADS TO THE QUESTION 'HOW CAN WE GAIN GREATER MOBILITY FROM EXISTING SYSTEMS WITH MINIMAL PHYSICAL ADDITIONS?' IN GENERAL  FIELD ROBOTS SEEK TO AVOID CONTACT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT EXCEPT FOR INTENTIONAL MANIPULATIONS PERFORMED BY AN END EFFECTOR. NONPREHENSILE MANIPULATION SEEKS TO UTILIZE INCIDENTAL INTERACTIONS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT TO ACCOMPLISH TASKS. BY TREATING THE GROUND ITSELF AS A TARGET FOR MANIPULATION AND MODIFICATION  NONPREHENSILE MANIPULATION CAN BE USED TO INCREASE MOBILITY OR LOCALLY TERRAFORM FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. I PROPOSE THE EXTENSION OF THE CONCEPT OF NON-PREHENSILE TERRAIN MANIPULATION TO NOVEL MOBILITY CONCEPTS. TO THIS END  I PROPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF PLATFORMS THAT ENABLE ROVERS TO CROSS DIFFICULT TERRAIN  NAMELY (INCLINATION OF GREATER THAN 15 - 20 DEGREES) SLOPES WITH SOFT SOIL OR LOOSE ROCK. WHILE THE CONCEPT OF NONPREHENSILE MANIPULATION IS WELL ESTABLISHED  IT HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEEN APPLIED TO MANIPULATION OF TERRAIN  AND HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED TO MOBILITY PROBLEMS. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY EXPLORING METHODS FOR ROVERS TO ACHIEVE A) CROSS-SLOPE TRAVERSAL VIA LEVELING OF DRIVE PATH WHILE IN TRANSIT  B) ASCENT OF LOOSE SLOPES VIA TERRAIN COMPACTION AND C) ASCENT OF LOOSE SLOPES VIA MATERIAL REMOVAL. THESE TRANSIT MODES WILL BE BUILT FROM ROBUST TERRAIN MANIPULATION PRIMITIVES  WHICH IN TURN WILL BE DRIVEN BY NOVEL SOIL-DISPLACEMENT FOCUSED TERRAMECHANICS MODELS. MODELS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ACCOUNT FOR REDUCED WHEEL SIZE AND DRIVING WITH NONZERO SLIP ANGLE  BUT EVEN THESE ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH TRACTIVE ABILITY AND DRIVING PERFORMANCE. NO THOUGHT IS GIVEN TO THE MOVEMENT OF SOIL. BY COMBINING THESE MODELS WITH BASIC SOIL MECHANICS  I WILL DEVELOP NEW MODELS WHICH DETERMINE SOIL DISPLACEMENT FROM A GIVEN ROVER STATE. I WILL DEVELOP A LIBRARY OF MOTIONS FOR MOVING SOIL BASED OFF THE MODELS DEVELOPED. ANALYSIS OF THESE MODELS WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHEEL MOTIONS CAPABLE OF MOVING TERRAIN WITH MINIMAL IMPACT ON MOBILITY. THESE WILL BE TUNED AND REFINED WITH PLATFORM EXPERIMENTS. HERE  CLASSIC TERRAMECHANICS MODELS CONCERNING TERRAIN TRAFFICABILITY AND ROVER TRACTION WILL BE COMBINED WITH THE DEVELOPED SOIL MANIPULATION PRIMITIVES. COMPARISON OF A WIDE RANGE OF TRAVERSABLE AND UN-TRAVERSABLE SOIL TOPOGRAPHIES WILL BE USED TO GENERATE HEURISTICS FOR CONVERTING IMPASSABLE TERRAIN TO TRAVERSABLE TERRAIN  E.G. BY FILLING A DITCH WITH SOIL TO CROSS IT. 'TRANSIT MODES' WILL THEN BE COMPOSED BY COMBINING TERRAIN MANIPULATION PRIMITIVES TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED TOPOGRAPHICAL MODIFICATION. ONCE TRANSIT MODES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED  THEY CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO A KINODYNAMIC MOTION PLANNER. THE STATE SPACE OF THE TERRAIN SHAPE WILL BE REDUCED TO A COMPUTATIONALLY FEASIBLE SIZE VIA APPROXIMATION OF THE HEIGHT MAP AS A GAUSSIAN PROCESS OR A SIMILAR LOW DIMENSIONAL MODEL.

THIS PROPOSED SPACE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AIMS TO DEVELOP A SIMULATION TOOL TO PREDICT THE EVOLUTION OF HIERARCHICAL NANOSTRUCTURING IN GLASS-CERAMIC TO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE IONIC CONDUCTIVITY OF SOLID-STATE ELECTROLYTES FOR LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES.

THE NEED THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IS WITHIN TA 2.4.2.3: IN-SPACE TANK-TO-TANK PROPELLANT TRANSFER [1]. HUMAN MARS MISSIONS WILL REQUIRE EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF CRYOGENS FROM A SUPPLY TANK TO A RECEIVER TANK IN MICROGRAVITY. AS NOTED IN THE NASA SSTIP  STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF CRYOGENS IN SPACE IS CRITICAL FOR DEEP SPACE HUMAN EXPLORATION  MAKING IT ONE OF THE SIX NRC HIGH PRIORITIES WITHIN THE  LAUNCH AND IN-SPACE PROPULSION  CORE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT. THE HIGH PERFORMANCE OFFERED BY THE CRYOGENIC PROPULSION WILL PERMIT LONGER RANGE MISSIONS  LARGER PAYLOAD MASSES  AND REDUCE HUMAN EXPOSURE TIME TO SPACE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS. IN-SPACE TANK-TO-TANK TRANSFER IS COMPOSED OF THREE OPERATIONAL ELEMENTS   1) HIGH EFFICIENCY LINE CHILLDOWN  2) HIGH EFFICIENCY TANK CHILLDOWN  AND 3) NO-VENT FILL OF THE RECEIVER TANK. WHEN TRANSFERRING CRYOGEN FROM A SUPPLY TANK TO A RECEIVER TANK  THE TRANSFER LINE (I.E. PIPE AND VALVES) AND RECEIVER TANK ARE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES COMPARED TO THAT OF THE LIQUID PROPELLANT. CHILLDOWN IS THE PROCESS OF INTRODUCING THE CRYOGEN INTO THE SYSTEM TO COOL THE HARDWARE DOWN TO THE LIQUID TEMPERATURE. THE FLOWING PROPELLANT BOILS OFF AS IT COOLS THE LINE AND TANK. SINCE THE PROPELLANT IS ONLY STORABLE AND USEFUL TO THE ENGINE IN PURE LIQUID FORM  THIS VAPORIZED PROPELLANT IS VENTED OVERBOARD AND CONSIDERED  LOST . SINCE EACH OF THE THREE ELEMENTS IS A TWO-PHASE FLOW PROCESS  THEY ARE ALL HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY THE GRAVITY LEVEL. THE PI S GROUP HAS PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED MANY TERRESTRIAL CHILLDOWN AND MICROGRAVITY PARABOLIC FLIGHT CHILLDOWN EXPERIMENTS FOR PIPES. MORE DIFFICULT TO MODEL AND IN MOST CASES MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE PROPELLANT THERMAL MANAGEMENT IS THE CHILLDOWN OF THE RECEIVER TANK. THE RECEIVER TANK IS THE MOST MASSIVE COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM TO BE CHILLED DOWN AND  THEREFORE  TAKES MUCH MORE TIME TO CHILL DOWN AND THUS MORE CRYOGEN CONSUMPTION. AS A RESULT  THE TIME AND PROPELLANT SPENT DURING CHILLDOWN WILL MOSTLY BE DICTATED BY HOW FAST THE TANK CAN BE CHILLED DOWN. BUT AT THIS TIME THERE HAVE BEEN NO STUDIES ON TANK CHILLDOWN IN ZERO GRAVITY. PREVIOUS TANK CHILLDOWN STUDIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO JUST 1G CONDITIONS AND WERE VERY SCARCE WITH ONLY TWO DATA SETS AVAILABLE AND THE EXPERIMENTS WERE POORLY EXECUTED [2].

THE PROPOSED WORK REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THE PREVIOUSLY FUNDED PROGRAM OBJECTIVES TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATE NEEDS IN THE ORION/SLS EXPLORATION MISSION ARCHITECTURE. SPECIFICALLY  WE ADDRESS TWO CENTRAL OBJECTIVES IN THE PROPOSED WORK. (1) WE INTEND TO DEMONSTRATE 1% ZERO-G GAUGING RESOLUTIONS OF BAFFLE-SETTLED REALISTIC PROPELLANT SIMULANT IN MODEL PROPELLANT TANKS WITH INTERNAL PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES. (2) WE INTEND TO VERIFY A CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THE MPG APPROACH  WHICH IS THAT THE MASS-LOADING OF TANK WALLS (AND THEREFORE THE MODAL FREQUENCIES) IS UNIQUELY DETERMINED BY THE ADHERED LIQUID LAYER. IN ORDER TO MEET THE PROPOSED OBJECTIVES  TWO DISTINCT EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED USING THE MPG PARABOLIC FLIGHT RIG WITH BAFFLE-SETTLED PROPELLANT SIMULANT. WE LL USE ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (IPA) TO BETTER REPRESENT THE BOND NUMBER AND OTHER LIQUID-STRUCTURE PARAMETERS OF CRYOGENIC PROPELLANTS IN REAL TANKS.

THE BAFFLES WILL BE DESIGNED AND TESTED TO PRODUCE SETTLED LIQUIDS WITHIN SECONDS AFTER THE ONSET OF ZERO-G PORTION OF THE PARABOLIC FLIGHT TRAJECTORY. THE TEST PLAN FOR OBJECTIVE 1 IS TO ACQUIRE 24 DATA POINTS AT 1% FILL-FRACTION INTERVALS AT 5 DATA POINTS PER FILL LEVEL (4X PARABOLIC FLIGHTS). THE SECOND OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ESTABLISHING A ZERO-G EQUILIBRIUM LIQUID SURFACE AT THREE DIFFERENT FILL FRACTIONS IN SIMPLIFIED MODEL TANKS. WE WILL CORRELATE THE MODAL FREQUENCY SPECTRUM AT EACH FILL FRACTION TO THE ADHERED LIQUID LAYER MASS USING CAMERAS TO VERIFY SURFACE EQUILIBRIUM AND TO MEASURE ADHERED LIQUID MASS FRACTION  AND BY USING OUR STANDARD MODAL SENSORS AND COMPUTATIONAL HARDWARE TO MEASURE MODAL RESPONSE. WE HAVE CARRIED OUT COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) CALCULATIONS TO DETERMINE THE TANK SIZE AND FILL FRACTION SUCH THAT AN EQUILIBRIUM SURFACE CAN BE OBTAINED WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTE OF THE 2.5 MINUTES OF ZERO-G AFFORDED BY THE BLUE ORIGIN NEW SHEPARD SUBORBITAL VEHICLE. THE REMAINING 1.5 MINUTES WILL BE USED TO ACQUIRE MODAL DATA OF THE THREE TANKS WITH SETTLED LIQUID SURFACES.THE TEST PLAN FOR OBJECTIVE 2 IS TO UTILIZE A DOUBLE-LOCKER PAYLOAD EXPERIMENT ON BLUE ORIGIN S NEW SHEPARD VEHICLE.

THE NEED THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IS WITHIN TA 2.4.2.3: IN-SPACE TANK-TO-TANK PROPELLANT TRANSFER [1]. HUMAN MARS MISSIONS WILL REQUIRE EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF CRYOGENS FROM A SUPPLY TANK TO A RECEIVER TANK IN MICROGRAVITY. AS NOTED IN THE NASA SSTIP  STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF CRYOGENS IN SPACE IS CRITICAL FOR DEEP SPACE HUMAN EXPLORATION  MAKING IT ONE OF THE SIX NRC HIGH PRIORITIES WITHIN THE  LAUNCH AND IN-SPACE PROPULSION  CORE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT. THE HIGH PERFORMANCE OFFERED BY THE CRYOGENIC PROPULSION WILL PERMIT LONGER RANGE MISSIONS  LARGER PAYLOAD MASSES  AND REDUCE HUMAN EXPOSURE TIME TO SPACE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS. IN-SPACE TANK-TO-TANK TRANSFER IS COMPOSED OF THREE OPERATIONAL ELEMENTS   1) HIGH EFFICIENCY LINE CHILLDOWN  2) HIGH EFFICIENCY TANK CHILLDOWN  AND 3) NO-VENT FILL OF THE RECEIVER TANK. WHEN TRANSFERRING CRYOGEN FROM A SUPPLY TANK TO A RECEIVER TANK  THE TRANSFER LINE (I.E. PIPE AND VALVES) AND RECEIVER TANK ARE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES COMPARED TO THAT OF THE LIQUID PROPELLANT. CHILLDOWN IS THE PROCESS OF INTRODUCING THE CRYOGEN INTO THE SYSTEM TO COOL THE HARDWARE DOWN TO THE LIQUID TEMPERATURE. THE FLOWING PROPELLANT BOILS OFF AS IT COOLS THE LINE AND TANK. SINCE THE PROPELLANT IS ONLY STORABLE AND USEFUL TO THE ENGINE IN PURE LIQUID FORM  THIS VAPORIZED PROPELLANT IS VENTED OVERBOARD AND CONSIDERED  LOST . SINCE EACH OF THE THREE ELEMENTS IS A TWO-PHASE FLOW PROCESS  THEY ARE ALL HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY THE GRAVITY LEVEL. THE PI S GROUP HAS PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED MANY TERRESTRIAL CHILLDOWN AND MICROGRAVITY PARABOLIC FLIGHT CHILLDOWN EXPERIMENTS FOR PIPES. MORE DIFFICULT TO MODEL AND IN MOST CASES MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE PROPELLANT THERMAL MANAGEMENT IS THE CHILLDOWN OF THE RECEIVER TANK. THE RECEIVER TANK IS THE MOST MASSIVE COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM TO BE CHILLED DOWN AND  THEREFORE  TAKES MUCH MORE TIME TO CHILL DOWN AND THUS MORE CRYOGEN CONSUMPTION. AS A RESULT  THE TIME AND PROPELLANT SPENT DURING CHILLDOWN WILL MOSTLY BE DICTATED BY HOW FAST THE TANK CAN BE CHILLED DOWN. BUT AT THIS TIME THERE HAVE BEEN NO STUDIES ON TANK CHILLDOWN IN ZERO GRAVITY. PREVIOUS TANK CHILLDOWN STUDIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO JUST 1G CONDITIONS AND WERE VERY SCARCE WITH ONLY TWO DATA SETS AVAILABLE AND THE EXPERIMENTS WERE POORLY EXECUTED [2].

THE USE OF TWO-PHASE THERMAL SYSTEMS ON SPACECRAFT HAS BEEN GREATLY HAMPERED BY THE INABILITY TO PREDICT WITH SUFFICIENT CONFIDENCE THEIR PERFORMANCE AT VARIOUS GRAVITY LEVELS (EARTH  MARS  AND LUNAR GRAVITY AND LOW-G).

ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF ATTEMPTING TO MODEL THIS TYPE OF FLOW AT THIS SCALE IS THAT THE FIBERS ARE VERY SMALL (     1 TO 10  M)  THE MEAN FREE PATH OF THE MOLECULES AND ATOMS IN THE GAS IS OFTEN ON THE ORDER OF THE FIBERS THEMSELVES. WHEN THIS IS THE CASE  THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS  WHICH ARE BASED ON A CONTINUUM ASSUMPTION  ARE NO LONGER VALID. FOR THIS KIND OF FLOW  THE VALUE OF THE KNUDSEN NUMBER - THE RATIO BETWEEN THE MEAN FREE PATH OF THE GAS AND A RELEVANT LENGTH SCALE  IN THIS CASE THE AVERAGE PORE DIAMETER - ENCOUNTERED BY THE MATERIAL IS>0.02. THIS SUGGEST THAT MODELING THESE FLOWS REQUIRES A METHOD WHICH CAN ACCOUNT FOR A RANGE OF KNUDSEN NUMBERS  AND IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN MORE RAREFIED REGIMES. ONE SUCH METHOD IS DIRECT SIMULATION MONTE CARLO (DSMC)  WHICH CAN EFFICIENTLY BE USED TO MODEL THE GAS PHASE  AND GAS-SURFACE INTERACTIONS PHENOMENA. DSMC IS A STOCHASTIC PARTICLE BASED METHOD  WHICH IS VALID -- GIVEN SUFFICIENT COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES -- FOR ALL KNUDSEN NUMBERS. ADDITIONALLY  THE METHOD CAN HANDLE CONVECTION  AS WELL AS MANY OTHER RELEVANT PHYSICAL PHENOMENA. WHEN THE HIGH TEMPERATURE FLOW INTERACTS WITH THE FIBERS  CHEMICAL REACTIONS -- MAINLY OXIDATION -- TAKES PLACE. THIS TYPICALLY OCCURS IN A CHARACTERISTIC SURFACE CONSUMPTION MODE REFERRED TO AS PITTING. RATHER THAN CONSUMING THE SURFACE UNIFORMLY  OXIDATION PROCEEDS PREFERENTIALLY THROUGH THE GROWTH IN DEPTH OF MULTIPLE CAVITIES SCATTERED ON THE ORIGINALLY SMOOTH SURFACE OF THE FIBER. THIS PHENOMENON RESULTS IN A NET INCREASE OF THE EXPOSED SURFACE  WHICH  IN ADDITION  FORMS HIGHLY REACTIVE SITES. BOTH EFFECTS ACCELERATE THE RATE OF OXIDATION  POTENTIALLY COMPROMISING THE STRENGTH OF THE FIBERS. THIS MAY LEAD TO THE EARLY BREAK-UP OF THE FIBERS  REDUCING DRAMATICALLY THE PROTECTING PROPERTIES OF THE TPS. PITTING CAN BE TRACED TO THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF CARBON OXIDATION  WHICH IS THE RESULT OF FOUR MAIN PROCESSES  NAMELY OXYGEN ADSORPTION  SURFACE DIFFUSION  SURFACE REACTION AND PRODUCTS DESORPTION.

IT WILL ALSO PREDICT THE EVOLUTION OF THE MECHANICAL AND THERMAL PROPERTIES OF THE PICA TPS DURING OPERATION. THIS TOOL WILL BE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF PICA MICROSTRUCTURE ON TPS PERFORMANCE  PROVIDING RESULTS THAT CAN BE USED TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE MECHANISTIC MATERIALS MODELS FOR MACROSCALE TPS CODES. ABLATIVE TPS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE PROTECTION OF VEHICLES AND PROBES DURING FLIGHT THROUGH A PLANETARY ATMOSPHERE. THUS  IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF TPS MATERIALS IS WELL UNDERSTOOD TO ENSURE ADEQUATE SAFETY MARGINS. THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF TPS MATERIALS CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE  AND CURRENT TESTING CAPABILITIES ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR TESTING TPS MATERIALS FOR MARS AND FAR SOLAR SYSTEM ENTRIES AND RETURNS. MODELING AND SIMULATION ARE ESSENTIAL FOR DECREASING DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND FACILITATING THE INVESTIGATION OF MATERIAL PERFORMANCE IN CONDITIONS FOR WHICH TESTING FACILITIES DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST. MACROSCALE TOOLS FOR MODELING THE BEHAVIOR OF TPS MATERIALS HAVE BEEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR MANY YEARS; HOWEVER  THEY EMPLOY SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS AND SIMPLIFIED CONSTITUTIVE MODELS THAT CAN DECREASE THEIR ACCURACY. IN THIS PROJECT  WE WILL DEVELOP A MESOSCALE MULTIPHYSICS MODELING TOOL THAT WILL QUANTITATIVELY PREDICT THE PYROLYSIS AND ABLATION OF PICA TPS. PICA IS COMPOSED OF A PHENOLIC RESIN AND CARBON FIBERS THAT ABLATE DURING REENTRY. THE PYROLYSIS OF THE RESIN TO FORM A CHAR LAYER AND THE ABLATION THROUGH OXIDATION OF THE CHAR AND FIBERS WILL BE MODELED USING THE PHASE FIELD METHOD AND WILL BE COUPLED TO MECHANICS AND HEAT CONDUCTION TO INCLUDE THE THERMOMECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF THE MATERIAL. THE EVOLUTION OF THE THERMOMECHANICAL PROPERTIES DURING PYROLYSIS AND ABLATION WILL ALSO BE PREDICTED. THE TOOL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED USING THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD IN THE OPEN SOURCE MULTIPHYSICS OBJECT ORIENTED SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT (MOOSE) FRAMEWORK. IT WILL BE DEVELOPED USING ROBUST QUALITY ASSURANCE PRACTICES  INCLUDING DETAILED VERIFICATION AND THE USE OF REGRESSION TESTS. THIS MESOSCALE TOOL WILL REQUIRE VARIOUS MATERIAL PROPERTIES AND PARAMETERS  MANY OF WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE  ESPECIALLY FOR THE CHAR. THEREFORE  ATOMIC-RESOLUTION SIMULATIONS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE THESE NECESSARY PARAMETERS. THIS USE OF LOWER-LENGTH SCALE SIMULATION METHODS WILL BOTH ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-FIDELITY MODELS OF ABLATIVE SYSTEMS OF CURRENT INTEREST  AND WILL ALSO ENABLE NEW CANDIDATE MATERIALS TO BE EXPLORED AND EVALUATED IN AN EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER. ONCE COMPLETE  THE MESOSCALE TOOL WILL BE VALIDATED AGAINST PICA ABLATION DATA. THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE MODEL PREDICTIONS WILL BE QUANTIFIED USING THE DAKOTA TOOL TO PROVIDE STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF A PREDICTED QUANTITY  GIVING A CONFIDENCE LEVEL ON THE VALIDATION. WE WILL USE THE VALIDATED MESOSCALE TOOL TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF VARIATIONS IN THE PICA MICROSTRUCTURE ON ITS PERFORMANCE. WE WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF DAMAGED MATERIAL ON THE PERFORMANCE AND THE MATERIAL BEHAVIOR AT INTERFACES BETWEEN PICA TILES.

THE MODULATOR  PHOTONIC FILTER  AND RESONANT DETECTOR WILL ALL BE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED USING MONOLITHICALLY FABRICATED LITHIUM NIOBATE CHIP-SCALE RESONATORS THAT CAN BE OPTICALLY AND PIEZOELECTRICALLY EXCITED SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE COHABITATION OF PHOTONS AND PHONONS IN A SINGLE RESONANT CAVITY OFFERS UNMATCHED CAPABILITIES IN DYNAMICALLY MODULATING  QUASI-STATICALLY TUNING  AND RESONANTLY ENHANCING THE TRANSFER FUNCTIONS OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS. UNPRECEDENTED TUNING RANGES IN MILLIMETER-WAVE CAN BE ACHIEVED BY HARNESSING THE FACT THAT EVEN A FRACTION OF TUNING AT OPTICAL FREQUENCIES TRANSLATES TO MULTI-OCTAVE BANDWIDTH AT RF.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ENABLE A FULL SOLUTION FOR PASSIVE MICROWAVE RADIOMETRY OVER A WIDE FREQUENCY RANGE (2-200 GHZ) WHILE MAINTAINING THE SPECTRAL SELECTIVITY (BW=0.1GHZ). THE SUBSYSTEMS WILL SEE APPLICATIONS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE AS WELL AS LIMB SOUNDERS AND AURORAL IMAGERS IN HELIOPHYSICS. EVEN THOUGH THE PROPOSED EFFORT FOCUSES ON MICRO- AND MILLIMETER-WAVE SIGNAL PROCESSING AND SENSING USING PIC  THE THREE COMPRISING SUBSYSTEMS AND THEIR UNIQUE CAPABILITIES CAN BE USED INDIVIDUALLY FOR OPTICAL FREQUENCY DATA ACQUISITION IN NASA SCIENCE MISSIONS.

IN THIS PROGRAM  WE AIM TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL CHALLENGES OF CREATING AN ULTRA-COMPACT ON-CHIP INTEGRATED SPECTROMETER WITH HIGH RESOLUTION  HIGH SENSITIVITY  AND A SMALL FOOTPRINT. WE WILL CRAFT THE INTEGRATED SPECTROMETERS USING THE NEWLY EMERGING METASURFACE TECHNOLOGY.

EACH SENSOR WILL CONSIST OF A MINIATURIZED WIDEBAND ANTENNA SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO HAVE A NUMBER OF RESONANCES IN ITS REFLECTION PROPERTY. BY USING THE REFLECTION PROPERTIES OF THE ANTENNA  REGIONS IN FREQUENCY OF RESONANCE AND REFLECTION CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH 0S AND 1S TO CREATE A SPECIFIC  CODE  FOR THAT ANTENNA. THIS CODE SHIFTS (IN FREQUENCY) OR ALTERS BASED ON THE PROPERTIES AND DEGRADATION OF THE MATERIAL IN WHICH THE ANTENNA IS EMBEDDED. THESE SENSORS COULD BE EMBEDDED IN MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES SUCH AS CONCRETE  A COMPOSITE FUSELAGE  OR AN ASTRONAUT S PLANETARY HABITAT  AND BY BEING PASSIVE  THE SENSORS WILL NOT NEED TO BE ENERGIZED (I.E.  WIRED IN OR PROVIDED WITH A POWER SOURCE). IN THE CASE OF A PLANETARY HABITAT  AN ASTRONAUT COULD EASILY INSPECT THEIR HOME FOR DAMAGE USING A SIMPLE TRANSCEIVER  AND PERFORM REPAIRS OR PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE IF NECESSARY. THIS PRACTICE WOULD INCREASE THE ASTRONAUT S SAFETY AND MINIMIZE THE RISK OF STRUCTURE FAILURE WHILE THEY EXPLORE AND ARE FACED WITH THE UNFORGIVING ENVIRONMENT OF SPACE. BECAUSE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS OF SUCH A LOW TRL NATURE  ITS FULL APPLICATION RANGE CANNOT BE CONCEPTUALIZED AT THIS POINT. HOWEVER  WITH THEIR LOW COST NATURE AND VERSATILITY  THESE SENSORS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE INTEGRATED INTO MANY SPACE STRUCTURES AND MATERIALS AS WELL AS EVERYDAY CIVIL AND AEROSPACE STRUCTURES LIKE BRIDGES  PARKING GARAGES  AND PLANES. ADDITIONALLY  THE SENSOR DATA COULD BE USED TO REFINE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.

ACTUATORS ARE FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF ROBOTS IN SPACE EXPLORATION  AND THEY WILL NEED TO BE VERSATILE IN HARSH AND VARIED ENVIRONMENTS. IT WILL ALSO BE CRITICAL THAT THESE ACTUATORS BE THERMALLY PROTECTED  ENERGY EFFICIENT  AND ROBUST IN THE CONTROL OF FORCES AND IMPEDANCE BEHAVIORS. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS  HUMAN-CENTERED ROBOTS COMMONLY MAKE USE OF SERIES ELASTIC ACTUATORS  WHICH OFFER COMPLIANCE FOR SAFE INTERACTION WITH HUMANS  INCREASED ROBUSTNESS  INCREASED FORCE SENSITIVITY  AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY AS COMPARED TO RIGID ACTUATORS. HOWEVER  OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE ARE LOST WHEN THE OPERATION OF THE ACTUATOR IS NOT ALIGNED WITH ITS DESIRED PURPOSE  FROM LIFTING HEAVY CARGO TO SWINGING A ROBOT S FOOT OVER UNEVEN TERRAIN. MY PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ADDRESS CURRENT NASA NEEDS  INCLUDING ACTUATOR CONTROLLERS THAT OPTIMIZE EFFICIENCY WITH FUNCTION  AND TACKLE THE ISSUES OF HEAT DISSIPATION IN SPACE. THE AIM OF MY RESEARCH IS TO DEVISE A NEW  INTELLIGENT LOW-LEVEL CONTROLLER THAT DRIVES SERIES ELASTIC ACTUATORS TO BEHAVE IN A MANNER THAT STRIKES THE MOST OPTIMAL BALANCE BETWEEN POWER OUTPUT  EFFICIENCY  FORCE SENSITIVITY  AND ACCURACY  WHILE MAINTAINING A HIGH LEVEL OF SAFETY AND ROBUSTNESS. A SECONDARY YET VALUABLE GOAL WILL BE TO EXPLORE HOW THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL CAPABILITIES OF AN ACTUATOR CAN DRIVE THE SYSTEM TO REMAIN OPERATING WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF ITS SAFETY LIMITS. BECAUSE THE ACTUATOR UPON WHICH I WILL CONDUCT MY RESEARCH IS COMPARABLE TO THE TYPE OF ACTUATORS CURRENTLY UTILIZED BY NASA  I WILL BE ABLE TO TEST AND APPLY MY WORK ON THEIR ROBOTS. THESE AIMS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SIMULATIONS AND RIGOROUS LABORATORY TESTING  USING AN APPROACH DESIGNED TO GUARANTEE THE MECHANICAL SAFETY OF THE SYSTEM. I WILL CONDUCT MY RESEARCH ON A CUTTING-EDGE  LIQUID-COOLED SERIES VISCOELASTIC ACTUATOR  WHICH OFFERS HIGHER CONTINUOUS TORQUE AND POWER OUTPUT  WITH MINIMAL DECREASES IN EFFICIENCY AS COMPARED TO THE OPERATION OF AIRCOOLED ACTUATORS. THE LIQUID-COOLING COMPONENTS OPEN THE DOOR TO THE EXPLORATION OF TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED MECHANICAL COMPONENTS IN EXTREME SPACE ENVIRONMENTS. IN DEVELOPING MY NEW CONTROL FRAMEWORK  THE FIRST STEP WILL BE TO CONDUCT SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION ON THE VISCOELASTIC ACTUATOR  UTILIZING STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MODEL S UNCERTAINTY. FROM THE RESULTS  I WILL DEVISE A MODEL OF THIS ACTUATOR  ACCOUNTING FOR MECHANICAL MOTION STATES AND TEMPERATURE DYNAMICS. I WILL ALSO DEVISE SIMILAR MODELS OF THE VALKYRIE AND/OR ROBONAUT 2 ACTUATORS. BASED ON THESE MODELS I WILL DESIGN A NOVEL PLANNER-CONTROLLER INTERFACE; THE HIGH-LEVEL PLANNER WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT TO THE LOW-LEVEL CONTROLLER  RATHER THAN SIMPLY COMMUNICATE DESIRED TORQUE OR DESIRED POSITION. I WILL THEN INVESTIGATE THE EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE POSSIBLE WITH A MORE-INFORMED LOW-LEVEL CONTROLLER. WHEN ITS MOTOR OPERATES NEAR THE BORDERS OF WHAT IS THERMALLY POSSIBLE FOR THE ACTUATOR  THIS STYLE OF CONTROLLER CAN GUARANTEE THAT THE HEAT PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF THE FEEDBACK CONTROL DOES NOT PUSH THE ACTUATOR BEYOND ITS THERMAL LIMITS. MY PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ANSWER VALUABLE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ADVANTAGES OF AN ALTERNATIVE ACTUATOR CONTROL METHOD  THE EFFICIENCY BENEFITS OF AN ENVIRONMENTALLY-AWARE LOW-LEVEL CONTROLLER  AND THE BENEFITS OF A TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

IN SECTION 10.1.4 OF THE NASA TECHNOLOGY AREA (TA) ROADMAP THE NEED FOR HIERARCHICAL COMPLIANCE  IN CONTROLLABLE ADHESIVES  TO CONFORM TO IRREGULAR AND UNEVEN SURFACES IS WELL ESTABLISHED. SOFT ROBOTICS OFFERS A HIGHLY PROMISING SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM DUE TO INHERENT COMPLIANCE  GLOBAL LOAD DISTRIBUTION  AND CONFORMAL PROPERTIES. HOWEVER  SOFT ROBOTIC DESIGNS ARE OFTEN NOT REGARDED AS SUITABLE SPACE TECHNOLOGY CANDIDATES BECAUSE THEY TYPICALLY EMPLOY ELASTOMERIC MATERIALS  USE PRESSURE DIFFERENTIALS FOR ACTUATION  AND DO NOT GUARANTEE PRECISE MOVEMENT OR POSITIONING. BY USING THE HIERARCHICAL COMPLIANCE AND LOAD DISTRIBUTION POSSIBLE WITH SOFT ROBOTICS  FOR WHICH THE MATERIAL AND DESIGN METHODOLOGIES WILL HAVE TO BE VALIDATED FOR SPACE APPLICATION  MY PROPOSED SOFT ROBOTIC ACTUATOR SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUBSTANTIALLY AID ON-ORBIT GRIPPING TECHNOLOGIES.

THE CORE TECHNOLOGY I PROPOSE IS A THIN FLUID ELASTOMER ACTUATOR OPTIMIZED TO AID CONTROLLABLE DRY ADHESIVES BY GENERATING PRELOAD  INCREASING LOAD DISTRIBUTION  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY  BY CONFORMING TO A BROAD RANGE OF SURFACE GEOMETRIES. FLUIDIC ELASTOMER ACTUATORS HAVE A SEALED INTERNAL CAVITY AND CAN BE USED TO GENERATE MOTION BY VARYING INTERNAL FLUID PRESSURE. THE ACTUATOR CAN BE DIRECTED TO MOVE WITH A SPECIFIC MOTION BY CONFIGURING THE DESIGN AND GEOMETRY OF THE INTERNAL CHAMBERS AND THE ENCAPSULATING ELASTOMER LAYERS. THUS  WITH A NON-UNIFORM STIFFNESS  THE ACTUATOR CAN BE DESIGNED TO EXTEND  BEND  OR TWIST. A KEY PROPERTY OF ELASTOMER ACTUATORS IS THAT IF IN CONTACT WITH A FOREIGN OBJECT  ACTUATOR DEFORMATION PATTERNS CHANGE DUE TO THE LOW STIFFNESS OF THE ACTUATOR RELATIVE TO THE OBJECT. THIS PROPERTY POSES TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR CONTROLLABLE DRY ADHESIVES. BY MAKING A THIN AND HIGHLY CONFORMAL ELASTOMER ACTUATOR PAD  DESIGNED FOR USE WITH SUCH ADHESIVES  IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN ACTUATOR THAT WILL CONFORM TO IRREGULAR SURFACE GEOMETRIES.

BASED ON THE PROPERTY OF ELASTOMER ACTUATORS TO CONFORM TO SURROUNDING OBJECTS  THEIR ABILITY TO GENERATE PRELOAD WITH AXIAL EXTENSION  AND THEIR DISTRIBUTED LOADING PATTERNS  MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT ELASTOMERIC ACTUATORS WILL ENABLE DRY ADHESIVES TO MAINTAIN ADHESION ON IRREGULAR SURFACE GEOMETRIES  SUCH AS THOSE FOUND ON SPACECRAFT. SPECIFICALLY  I SEEK TO USE SOFT ROBOTIC OPTIMIZATION AND MODELING TECHNIQUES TO MAXIMIZE AND PREDICT SURFACE CONTACT AND ADHESIVE FORCE OF THE PROPOSED ACTUATOR AND INTEGRATED DRY ADHESIVES. AS I DEVELOP PROTOTYPES  I WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS IN THREE WAYS. I WILL COMPARE ADHESIVE STRENGTH WITH AND WITHOUT AN ELASTOMER ACTUATOR  ON FLAT SURFACES  TO ENSURE LOAD DISTRIBUTION AND PRELOAD PROPERTIES ARE MAINTAINED. I WILL MEASURE ADHESIVE STRENGTH ON A BROAD SET OF SPACE-RELEVANT IRREGULAR SURFACES  SUCH AS MLI SHEETING  SURFACES WITH BOLT HEADS  CORNERS  AND COMPOUND CURVES  AND COMPARE THE ADHESION TO THE BASELINE ESTABLISHED FOR FLAT SURFACES.

THIS RESONANCE WILL RESULT IN MAXIMUM LONGITUDINAL WAVE PROPAGATION WHEN THE SYSTEM EXPERIENCES VIBRATIONS ON RESONANCE  LEADING TO THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PIEZOELECTRIC MONOLAYER MOS2 PAIRS. IN THIS REGARD  THE PROPOSED ENERGY HARVESTER IS DESIGNED TO HAVE FREQUENCYTUNABILITY  BY CONTROLLING THE CRUMPLING OF THE MOS2 MONOLAYERS  IMPROVING POWER OUTPUT. TO REALIZE THE PROPOSED SYSTEM  THERE ARE FOUR KEY RESEARCH OBJECTIVES. FIRST WE WILL PURSUE FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES ON (1) THE EFFECT OF CRUMPLING ON THE EFFECTIVE MECHANICAL STIFFNESS OF MOS2 AND (2) THE EFFECT OF CRUMPLING ON THE PIEZOELECTRIC COEFFICIENT OF MOS2. WE WILL THEN (3) INVESTIGATE THE POWER GENERATION RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT MODES OF VIBRATION FREQUENCIES. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE  IN REAL WORLD SYSTEMS  NANOGENERATORS ARE SUBJECT TO FAR MORE VARIED MODES OF VIBRATIONS. INVESTIGATION OF THE PROPOSED DEVICES RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT MODES OF VIBRATION FREQUENCIES WILL BE USED TO CONFIRM THE FREQUENCY TUNABILITY OF OUR ENERGY HARVESTER AND COMPARE ITS ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCY TO EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES.

THESE OBJECTIVES CAN BE ARBITRARY  AND APPLICATIONS TO COOPERATIVE MISSION OBJECTIVES SUCH AS RENDEZVOUS AND SCIENCE OBJECTIVES SUCH AS PLANETARY FLYOVER WILL SPECIFICALLY BE INVESTIGATED. OPTIMAL TRAJECTORIES IN NON-COOPERATIVE CASES (E.G. ONE SPACECRAFT  CHASING  ANOTHER) WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED BECAUSE OF THE APPLICABILITY TO SPACECRAFT IMPACT MITIGATION AND DEBRIS AVOIDANCE. THE GENERAL OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK WILL SUBSEQUENTLY BE USED TO INVESTIGATE AUTONOMOUS COOPERATION OF MULTIPLE SPACECRAFT WHERE THE OPTIMIZATION IS PERFORMED ONLINE AND INFORMATION IS SHARED BETWEEN THE SPACECRAFT. THIS INCLUDES EXPLORING THE DEGREE OF INFORMATION SHARING NEEDED FOR MULTIPLE SPACECRAFT TO OPTIMIZE MISSION GOALS SUCH AS AUTONOMOUS RENDEZVOUS. AUTONOMOUS OPERATIONS CAN RELIEVE THE BOTTLENECK OF GROUND COMMUNICATION AND ENABLE THE COMPLETION OF MANY MORE MISSION OBJECTIVES. THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS INVESTIGATING SPACECRAFT COOPERATION AND NON-COOPERATION WILL BE USING REACHABLE SETS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED FOR SINGLE SPACECRAFT. GIVEN THE REACHABLE SPACE (IN ORBIT ELEMENT SPACE) OF EACH SPACECRAFT FOR A CERTAIN AVAILABLE DELTA V  THE INTERSECTION POINT OF THE SPACES PRESENTS AN OPTIMIZED RENDEZVOUS LOCATION FOR LOW DELTA V. THIS SAME IDEA CAN BE EXTENDED TO THE NON-COOPERATIVE PURSUIT/EVASION CASE WHERE AN EVADING SPACECRAFT CALCULATES THE PURSUING SPACECRAFT S REACHABLE SPACE AND FINDS THE FARTHEST POINT ON THAT SPACE THAT IT IS ABLE TO REACH. THIS LIMITED INVESTIGATION WILL THEN BE GENERALIZED USING THE FRAMEWORK OF DIFFERENTIAL GAME THEORY  WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE  MANY PLAYER  EQUIVALENT OF OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY. THE GENERALIZATION WILL FIRST BE TO THE PURSUIT/EVASION FORMULATION OF A DIFFERENTIAL GAME. THIS WILL ALLOW DIRECT COMPARISON TO THE REACHABLE SET METHODS AND IS A STEPPING STONE TOWARDS THE MORE GENERALIZED DIFFERENTIAL GAME FORMULATION THAT IS MORE FLEXIBLE IN HANDLING VARIOUS MISSION GOALS. THE GENERAL DIFFERENTIAL GAME FRAMEWORK WILL ALLOW THE OPTIMIZATION OF ARBITRARY CRITERIA TO MEET MISSION GOALS BEYOND WHAT CAN BE CALCULATED USING REACHABLE SETS AND THE PURSUIT/EVASION GAME. THIS ALLOWS THE CALCULATION OF OPTIMAL TRAJECTORIES FOR MULTIPLE SPACECRAFT TO ACHIEVE SPECIFIED GOALS. THE GENERAL DIFFERENTIAL GAME FORMULATION ALSO ENABLES THE INVESTIGATION OF INFORMATION SHARING NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL COOPERATION. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PROJECT ARE FAR REACHING AND BECOMING INCREASINGLY SIGNIFICANT. SPACE MISSIONS ARE BECOMING MORE COMPLEX  WITH GREATER RELIANCE ON SUCCESSFUL COORDINATION OF MULTIPLE IN-ORBIT ASSETS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE MORE COMPLEX MISSION GOALS. AS MORE AMBITIOUS MISSIONS MAKE USE OF MULTIPLE SPACECRAFT  OPTIMIZING OVERALL COORDINATION OF THE SPACECRAFT WILL BECOME MORE IMPORTANT TO REDUCING COST AND INCREASING CHANCES OF MISSION SUCCESS. NASA S ASTEROID REDIRECT MISSION TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE GREATER FLEXIBILITY BY USING SEPARATE ROBOTIC AND HUMAN ELEMENTS THAT WILL RENDEZVOUS NEAR THE MOON. SIMILARLY  FUTURE MANNED MARS MISSIONS MAY REQUIRE THE RENDEZVOUS OF MULTIPLE ASSETS SENT TO THE PLANET BEFOREHAND. THERE ARE ALSO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT USING GROUPS OF SMALLSATS TO MAP ASTEROIDS. THE COORDINATION CAPABILITIES DEVELOPED HERE CAN DIRECTLY IMPACT THESE MISSIONS BY INCREASING SCIENCE RETURNS AND DECREASING COSTS.

PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF SPACE-LIKE RADIATION HAVE LACKED THE TECHNOLOGY TO SELECTIVELY IRRADIATE INDIVIDUAL CELLS IN CULTURE  MUCH LESS INDIVIDUAL CELLULAR STRUCTURES. THUS THERE IS CURRENTLY NO WAY TO OBSERVE HOW INDIVIDUAL NEURONS RESPOND TO RADIATION-INDUCED DAMAGE OF SPECIFIC CELLULAR STRUCTURES  WHICH IS CRITICAL TO BUILDING THE MECHANISTIC LINK BETWEEN RADIATION DAMAGE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES. OVERALL GOAL: THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM UTILIZING PARTICLE MICROBEAM TECHNOLOGY AND NEURONAL CELL CULTURE THAT CAN SERVE AS A GROUND-BASED ANALOG TO NEURON EXPOSURE TO SPACE RADIATION. THIS NEURON-MICROBEAM SYSTEM WILL BE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR EFFECTS OF HIGH-ENERGY PARTICLE RADIATION ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. BACKGROUND: SPACE RADIATION POSES ONE OF THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD AND LEAST MITIGATED RISKS TO HUMANS TRAVELING OUTSIDE THE PROTECTION OF EARTH S MAGNETIC FIELD. PREVIOUS RADIATION BIOLOGY RESEARCH HAS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DNA DAMAGE AND THE RESULTING CARCINOGENESIS RISK  AND THIS WORK HAS BEEN LARGELY CONCERNED WITH LOW LINEAR ENERGY TRANSFER (LET) IONIZING RADIATION SUCH AS GAMMA RAYS AND X-RAYS. HOWEVER  SPACE RADIATION INCLUDES A VARIETY OF HIGH ATOMIC NUMBER  HIGH-ENERGY (HZE) IONS THAT TRANSFER LARGE AMOUNTS OF ENERGY WHEN TRAVERSING BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS. A MARS TRIP WOULD EXPOSE ASTRONAUTS TO A TOTAL OF ABOUT 0.2 GY OF HZE IONS. THIS DOSE IS RELATIVELY SMALL FOR LOW LET RADIATION  BUT HZE IONS WITH A HIGH LET CAN INFLICT SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL DAMAGE EVEN AT THIS LOW DOSE. THE LONG-STANDING RADIATION BIOLOGY THEORY THAT DNA IS THE PRIMARY RADIOSENSITIVE TARGET IN CELLS MAY NOT HOLD TRUE FOR THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) IN THE LOW-FLUENCE  HIGH-ENERGY CHARGED PARTICLE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT OF SPACE. BECAUSE MUCH OF THE CNS CONSISTS OF VOLUMES CONTAINING MOSTLY CELLULAR PROCESSES AND RELATIVELY FEW CELL BODIES  IT IS PLAUSIBLE THAT IN LOW DOSE AND DOSE RATE CONDITIONS  ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF CELLS TRAVERSED BY A CHARGED PARTICLE WILL SUFFER DAMAGE TO THE NUCLEUS. THUS THE OBSERVED RADIATION-INDUCED DEFICITS ARE LIKELY CAUSED BY THE TRAVERSAL OF A PARTICLE THROUGH SOME EXTRA-NUCLEAR COMPONENT OF THE CELL. RESEARCH PLAN: THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A CELL CULTURE METHOD FOR NEURONS THAT FITS THE TIGHT CONSTRAINTS OF THE MICROBEAM SYSTEM. THE NEW CULTURE METHOD WILL BE EVALUATED BY ITS ABILITY TO REPLICATE PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED CHANGES IN DENDRITIC SPINE MORPHOLOGY AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CYTOSKELETAL PROTEINS. THE LATTER STAGES OF THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON INTEGRATING THIS CELL CULTURE METHOD WITH THE PARTICLE MICROBEAM AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY S RADIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ACCELERATOR FACILITY. A CUSTOM IMAGING AND TARGETING PROTOCOL WILL BE DEVELOPED USING FLUORESCENT REPORTERS AND THE MICROBEAM FACILITY S TARGETING SYSTEM TO SELECTIVELY IRRADIATE SUBCELLULAR STRUCTURES OF INDIVIDUAL NEURONS IN NEURONAL CULTURES.

IN PARTICULAR IT WILL FOCUS ON THE OPTIMIZATION OF A 2D MATERIAL ENERGY HARVESTER AND CHEMICAL SENSOR TO DEMONSTRATE A SPECIFIC SYSTEM FOR WHICH 2D MATERIALS HAVE UNIQUE ADVANTAGES OVER THEIR COMPETITORS AND IMMEDIATE BENEFITS IN THEIR APPLICATION. SELF-POWERED SENSING SYSTEMS CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO EMBEDDED SYSTEMS THAT MONITOR THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF SPACECRAFT  SAMPLE THE CHEMISTRY OF A FOREIGN ENVIRONMENT  OR KEEP TRACK OF AN ASTRONAUT S HEALTH THROUGH SMART TEXTILES. TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A GOAL  THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON STUDYING THE MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD) GROWN 2D MATERIALS AND FROM THIS POINT DEVELOP DEVICES THAT CAN HARVEST ENERGY FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND POWER A SEMICONDUCTING SENSING COMPONENT. THIS PROJECT WILL BE DIVIDED INTO FIVE AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT: (1) I WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A STANDARD  CLEAN AND REPEATABLE PROCESS FOR WORKING WITH TRANSFERRED CVD MATERIAL. I WILL ESPECIALLY NEED TO INVESTIGATE DEVICE PASSIVATION LAYERS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE OPTIMAL DEVICE PERFORMANCE. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE WORK ON THIS FOR MOS2  HOWEVER I WOULD NEED TO EXTEND THIS KNOWLEDGE IN WORKING WITH CVD GROWN WSE2. WORK IN THIS PORTION OF THE PROJECT WILL INVOLVE SHORT LOOP PROCESSES AND EXTENSIVE CHARACTERIZATION. (2) THE SECOND TASK WILL BE TO DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF MY CVD GROWN MATERIALS TO BETTER PREDICT CHANGES IN THE MATERIALS  BAND STRUCTURE AND RESULTANT TRANSPORT PROPERTIES DUE TO MATERIAL ALTERATIONS SUCH AS STRAIN  PASSIVATION  AND CHEMICAL DOPING. ONCE I BEGIN TESTING FABRICATED DEVICES  I WILL ALSO DEVELOP UPON COMPACT MODELS THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DEVELOPED FOR MOS2 TRANSISTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW MY DEVICES WILL BEHAVE IN A CIRCUIT. I WILL COLLABORATE WITH ANOTHER LAB THAT SPECIALIZES IN DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY TO DEVELOP THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED MATERIALS MODELS. (3) IN PARALLEL TO TASK 2 AND USING THE RESULTS FROM TASK 1  I WILL BEGIN EXPERIMENTAL WORK TO DEVELOP CHEMICAL SENSORS. THESE SENSORS WILL BE DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE THEIR STABILITY  SENSITIVITY  RESPONSE TIME  AND SELECTIVITY. (4) THE FOURTH TASK WILL BE TO WORK ON AN ENERGY HARVESTING DEVICE. THE GOAL HERE IS TO AIM FOR BOTH OPEN CIRCUIT VOLTAGE AND HIGH SHORT CIRCUIT CURRENT TO SUPPLY USEABLE POWER TO A LOAD CIRCUIT. MY FIRST FOCUS WILL BE ON PHOTOVOLTAICS  AS 2D MATERIALS  IN PARTICULAR WSE2  SHOW UNIQUE PROMISE IN THIS AREA TO CREATE THIN  FLEXIBLE  HIGH EFFICIENCY AND STABLE SOLAR CELLS. I WILL ALSO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF GENERATING POWER THROUGH CHEMICAL GRADIENTS AS THIS IS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCE FOR CIRCUITS EXPOSED TO WET OR HIGHLY ACIDIC/ BASIC ENVIRONMENTS. (5) THE FINAL CULMINATING TASK WILL BE TO INTEGRATE THE ENERGY HARVESTING COMPONENT WITH THE CHEMICAL SENSOR. THIS PORTION OF THE PROJECT WILL AIM TO DEMONSTRATE THE APPLICABILITY AND VALUE OF 2D MATERIALS AS THE FOUNDATION OF A DISTRIBUTED SENSING NETWORK CIRCUIT BLOCK. IT WILL REQUIRE TECHNOLOGY AND EXPERTISE DEVELOPED FROM THE PREVIOUS FOUR STEPS. THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER ELECTRICAL AND MATERIALS ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES TO PROBE THE CAPABILITIES OF 2D MATERIALS TO HARVEST ENERGY AND COLLECT DATA. SUCCESS IN THIS PROJECT WILL ENHANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AND METHODOLOGY NEEDED TO DEVELOP A SELFPOWERED SYSTEM  AND FINALLY GIVE US THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP CUSTOMIZABLE UBIQUITOUS ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS THAT CAN AID ALL AVENUES OF SPACE EXPLORATION THAT REQUIRE SENSING CAPABILITIES.

PROJECT SUMMARY:  RECENT SPACE EXPLORATION MISSIONS HAVE REVEALED VOLATILE DEPOSITS ON SEVERAL SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS  INCLUDING THE MOON  MARS  MERCURY  AND NEAR EARTH ASTEROIDS (NEAS).  MOST OF THESE AIRLESS I.E.  ZERO-ATMOSPHERE OBJECTS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY NASA AS DESTINATIONS FOR FUTURE HUMAN EXPLORATION.  THESE OBJECTS ARE BOMBARDED BY RADIATION (I.E. SOLAR WIND  GALACTIC AND SOLAR COSMIC RAYS) AND THE INTERACTION OF RADIATION WITH THEIR SURFACES CAN ALTER AND EVEN PRODUCE VOLATILES.  MORE IMPORTANTLY  THE CONSTANT RADIATION ASSAULT POSES OBVIOUS  LIFE-THREATENING  AND PROGRAM-LIMITING HEALTH RISKS.  AS A MEMBER OF THE SSERVI  THE REVEALS TEAM WILL EXPLORE THE FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED ASPECTS CORRELATED WITH RADIATION PROCESSING OF NATURAL REGOLITH AND MAN-MADE COMPOSITE MATERIALS.  THE REVEALS TEAM WILL FOCUS ON TWO INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH THEMES  EACH COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE TASKS THAT WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN AN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS APPROACH.THEME 1 INTERACTION OF RADIATION AND MICROMETEORITES WITH SURFACE OF AIRLESS BODIES  THE SOLAR WIND INTERACTION WITH REGOLITH HAS BEEN IMPLICATED AS A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF VOLATILES (I.E. WATER) THAT CAN BE TRAPPED AND SEQUESTERED IN THE NEAR SURFACE REGION OF THE MOON AND POSSIBLY DEMOS  PHOBOS  AND NEAS.  THE RELEVANT PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND DRIVING INTERACTIONS ARE UNCLEAR.  THEREFORE  THEME 1 WILL FOCUS ON THREE TASKS: 1) EXAMINE SOLAR WIND  MICROMETEORITE PROCESSING OF AIRLESS BODY SURFACES AND DUST IRRADIATION SOURCES  2 DEVELOP MOLECULAR MODELS DESCRIBING RADIATION INDUCED TRANSFORMATION OF REGOLITH  3 EXAMINE THE ROLE OF CHARGING AND ELECTRIC FIELDS ON VOLATILE FORMATION/RELEASE AND 4) TEST SOLAR COLLECTION PANELS AS AN IN SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION STRATEGY OF PRODUCING WATER FROM REGOLITHTHEME 2 DEVELOPING AND TESTING NEW MATERIALS FOR IMPROVED SAFETY AND HEALTH DURING HUMAN EXPLORATION HUMAN EXPLORATION MISSIONS BEYOND NEAR EARTH ORBIT CANNOT OCCUR WITHOUT A VALIDATED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ASTRONAUT HEALTH RISKS DUE TO RADIATION.  THIS REQUIRES CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT  EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF RADIATION PROTECTION METHODOLOGIES  AND THE ABILITY TO PREDICT AND MONITOR THE RADIATION ABSORBED BY ASTRONAUTS ON A REAL-TIME AND MISSION-INTEGRATED BASIS. AS OF 2016  THE DEEP-SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT IS REASONABLY CHARACTERIZED  BUT RADIATION PROTECTION MATERIALS FOR HUMAN HABITATS AND SPACE-SUITS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED AND CHARACTERIZED  AND REAL-TIME RADIATION MONITORS ARE IN THEIR INFANCY.  FOR EXAMPLE  REAL-TIME AREA RADIATION MONITORS ARE CURRENTLY UTILIZED ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WITH INCONSISTENT RESULTS  AND THEY ARE NOT INTEGRATED WITH SPACE-SUITS.  DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG  FLEXIBLE AND RADIATION PROTECTIVE MATERIAL IS ALSO LAGGING.  THEREFORE  THEME 2 WILL FOCUS ON ASSESSING AND MITIGATING HUMAN RADIATION RISKS BY 1 TESTING REGOLITH AS A POTENTIAL SHIELDING MATERIAL  2) DEVELOPING  CHARACTERIZING AND TESTING NOVEL COMPOSITE MATERIALS FOR SUPERIOR MECHANICAL  THERMAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES  3 INTEGRATING THE BEST POLYMER COMPOSITES AS MODIFICATION TO EXISTING SPACE-SUITS  AND 4 DEVELOPING REAL-TIME LOW WEIGHT AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION RADIATION MONITORING DEVICES USING GRAPHENE AND OTHER 2D MATERIALS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f7c481d7-071a-ead9-3bda-e4e7d1e903a7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80ARC017M0007_8000"}, {"internal_id": 79661118, "Award ID": "80AFRC19M0003", "Award Amount": 245220.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-03-18", "CFDA Number": "43.012", "Description": "AUTOMATED RADIATION MEASUREMENTS FOR AEROSPACE SAFETY SUBORBITAL (ARMAS-S)  ADDRESSES AUTOMATED RADIATION MEASUREMENTS FOR AEROSPACE SAFETY SUBORBITAL (ARMAS-S)  ADDRESSES TOPIC 1 DEMONSTRATION OF SPACE TECHNOLOGY PAYLOADS) AND WILL BE THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF A REAL-TIME COTS TECHNOLOGY FOR IONIZING-RADIATION DOSE ASSESSMENT AT ALTITUDES UP TO LOW EARTHORBIT (LEO) WITH A MANNED SUBORBITAL APPLICATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "de54c7d7-4853-fef6-8432-a481c662d0da-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80AFRC19M0003_8000"}, {"internal_id": 69726165, "Award ID": "80AFRC18M0002", "Award Amount": 130763.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-09-13", "CFDA Number": "43.012", "Description": "LISA-T - LIGHTWEIGHT INTEGRATED SOLAR ARRAY AND ANTENNA IS AN INTEGRATED SOLAR ARRAY THAT IS DEPLOYED FROM AN EXTREMELY COMPACT VOLUME.
