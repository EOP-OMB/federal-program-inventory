THIS KEY THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTY IS OF INTEREST FOR MATERIALS PROCESSING AND IN WELDING OPERATIONS IN SPACE AND ON GROUND. THE NOVEL METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IFT PROPOSED INVOLVES THE USE OF ELECTROSTATICALLY FORCED FARADAY INSTABILITY. IN THIS METHOD  AN OSCILLATORY ELECTROSTATIC FORCING IS APPLIED TO A LIQUID SYSTEM  RESULTING IN SUDDEN PATTERN FORMATION AT THE INTERFACE  I.E.  AN INSTABILITY IS CAUSED. THE \"INSTABILITY\" IS A RESULT OF RESONANCE BETWEEN THE IMPOSED FORCING FREQUENCY AND THE NATURAL FREQUENCY OF THE SYSTEM. THE CRITICAL AMPLITUDE AND MODE SHAPES ARE PREDICTABLE FROM LINEAR STABILITY THEORY AND AGREE SUPERBLY WITH EXPERIMENTS. THE MEASUREMENT OF IFT DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH THE GOALS OF THE THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTY MEASUREMENT EMPHASIS OF THE CURRENT NRA. FARADAY EXPERIMENTS BY THIS TEAM USING MECHANICAL FORCING HAVE SHOWN EXCELLENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEORY AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. HOWEVER  IN THE CASE OF MECHANICAL FORCING  THE FORCE OF GRAVITY OVERWHELMS THE EFFECTS OF IFT ON THE SYSTEM STABILITY AND THEREFORE IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE IFT WITH ACCURACY. ELECTROSTATIC FORCING COUNTERS GRAVITY  ALLOWING THE EFFECTS OF IFT TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE ULTIMATE DETERMINATION OF THE SYSTEM STABILITY. ACCORDINGLY  EXPERIMENTALLY MAPPED STABILITY CURVES CAN BE FIT ACCURATELY WITH THEORETICAL CURVES  ALLOWING FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE IFT WITH GREAT ACCURACY. THE PROPOSING TEAM HAS SUCCESSFULLY USED ELECTROSTATIC FORCING IN GROUND EQUIPMENT TO SHOW THAT FARADAY WAVES CAN BE OBTAINED AS PER THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS. THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART USES AN OPEN CONTAINER GEOMETRY TO HOLD THE LIQUID. HOWEVER  A LEVITATED SPHERE MAY ALSO BE USED  AND OUR PROPOSAL NECESSARILY INCLUDES THIS METHOD. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE A PROJECT WITH TWO NEW ASPECTS. IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THE RESEARCH  WE PROPOSE TO USE GROUND-BASED FACILITIES AT JAXA AND NASA MARSHALL TO ACCURATELY OBTAIN THE IFT FOR LIQUIDS USING ELECTROSTATIC FARADAY FORCING IN OPEN CONTAINERS AS WELL AS IN LEVITATED DROPS.

USING ELECTROSTATIC FORCING INSTABILITY WILL PERMIT AN INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION OF MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED BY THE SINGLE-PULSE OSCILLATINGDROP TECHNIQUE WHERE DECAY RATES ARE MEASURED AND RELATED TO INTERFACIAL TENSION AND VISCOSITY. GROUND-BASED RESEARCH USING THE ELECTROSTATIC LEVITATOR AVAILABLE AT THE NASA MSFC AND JAXA  AND SPACE EXPERIMENTS ON ELF IN THE ISS WILL PROVIDE ACCURATE DATA.

WE PROPOSE USING FORCE AND TACTILE SENSING TO LOCALIZE THESE KINDS OF MATERIALS ACCURATELY DURING IN-HAND MANIPULATION AND THEREBY MAKE DEXTEROUS ROBOT MANIPULATION MORE ROBUST AND PRECISE. PRIOR WORK BY THE PI USING THE NASA-JSC ROBONAUT 2 HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT TACTILE SENSING CAN INDEED BE USED TO MAKE MANIPULATION MORE ROBUST. HOWEVER  IT IS DIFFICULTTO SCALE THE APPROACH UP TO LARGE PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING A HAPTIC MODEL OF WHAT THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO FEEL LIKE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS HARD TO MODEL FLEXIBLE MATERIALS ANALYTICALLY AND IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO GATHER A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AMOUNT OF TRAINING EXPERIENCE TO TRAIN AN ACCURATE MODEL. MOREOVER  EVEN VERY SOPHISTICATED TACTILE SENSORS SOMETIMES PRODUCE VERY NOISY AND ATTENUATED DATA.THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE FLEXIBLE MATERIALS MANIPULATION MORE PRACTICAL BY DEVELOPING NEW METHODS OF CREATING AND USING HAPTIC MODELS. WE PROPOSE TO LEVERAGE EXISTING ROBOT LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING WORK DEVELOPED IN THE MOBILE ROBOT COMMUNITY. ALREADY IN OUR LAB  WE HAVE STARTED THIS WORK AND DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED SOME BASIC TACTILE MAPPING TECHNIQUES THAT WERE SUMMARIZED AT THE 2013 NASA NRI PI MEETING. HERE  WE PROPOSE TO APPLY THIS WORK IN REAL ROBOT MANIPULATION CONTEXTS  CULMINATING IN A DEMONSTRATION OF TACTILE MAPPING AND LOCALIZATION CAPABILITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF SMALL AND FLEXIBLE MATERIALS MANIPULATION TASKS. IN YEAR 1  WE PROPOSE TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE TACTILE REGISTRATION AND MAPPING TECHNIQUES AND TO DEMONSTRATE BASIC TACTILELOCALIZATION CAPABILITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF A FINE-MATERIALS INSERTION TASK. WE EXPECT THIS WORK TO BE DEMONSTRATED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN EXPERIMENT WITH THE BAXTER ROBOT  LOCATED AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY. IN YEAR 2  WE PROPOSE TO EXPAND THESE MANIPULATION CAPABILITIES BY DEVELOPING MORE ROBUST AND SOPHISTICATED PLANNING AND CONTROL METHODS THAT REASON ABOUT HOW THE MANIPULATION STRATEGY AFFECTS THE INFORMATION CONTENT AND SAFETY ENVELOPE OF THE MANIPULATION TASK.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4787a47d-4e7a-9c8a-99e6-91ba7f4c9b8b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NNX13AQ85G_8000"}, {"internal_id": 49205604, "Award ID": "NNX13AQ81G", "Award Amount": 575000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2013-09-10", "CFDA Number": "43.007", "Description": "SMECTIC LIQUID CRYSTALS COMPOSED OF FLUID LAYERS CAN BE MADE TO FORM FREELY SUSPENDED, SINGLE COMPONENT, FLUID FILMS AS THIN AS A SINGLE MOLECULAR LA", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7d586cfa-95f6-0e31-3589-fbd59b788eda-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NNX13AQ81G_8000"}, {"internal_id": 49205601, "Award ID": "NNX13AQ78G", "Award Amount": 381728.02, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2013-09-12", "CFDA Number": "43.007", "Description": "THE CONSTRAINED VAPOR BUBBLE (CVB) IS AN IDEAL EXPERIMENTAL SETUP   IT LETS THE INVESTIGATOR STUDY COMPLEX FLUID FLOW AND EVAPORATIVE HEAT TRANSFER P", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d3be7d3a-ba4a-8f04-76e3-df70beba3000-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NNX13AQ78G_8000"}, {"internal_id": 49205592, "Award ID": "NNX13AQ69G", "Award Amount": 519760.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2013-09-26", "CFDA Number": "43.007", "Description": "BICONTINUOUS INTERFACIALLY JAMMED EMULSION GELS (BIJELS) ARE A NEW CLASS OF SOFT MATERIALS WITH INTERPENETRATING CO-CONTINUOUS ARRANGEMENT OF TWO IMMISCIBLE LIQUID PHASES SEPARATED BY A MONOLAYER OF COLLOIDAL PARTICLES.

SOME OF THE MOST COMMON EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM MICROGRAVITY EXPOSURE INCLUDE IMMUNE SYSTEM DYSREGULATION  SKELETAL MUSCLE ATROPHY  CARDIOVASCULAR DECLINE  BONE LOSS  COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS  AND DECREASED MOTOR CONTROL. UNFORTUNATELY  THE UNDERLYING ETIOLOGY OF MICROGRAVITY INDUCED DYSFUNCTION REMAINS UNCLEAR. DECADES OF NASA RESEARCH ON ISS AND SHUTTLE MISSIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURES EXHIBIT ALTERED MORPHOLOGY  PROLIFERATION  MOTILITY  DIFFERENTIATION AND OFTEN INCREASED OXIDATIVE STRESS WHEN EXPOSED TO THE MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. THUS  PHYSIOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION AT THE TISSUE AND SYSTEMIC LEVEL IS LIKELY A RESULT OF ALTERED CELLULAR FUNCTION  SUBCELLULAR STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS AND INTRACELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS. IT HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED THAT THE LACK OF GRAVITY ON-ORBIT HAS RESULTED IN A CYTOSKELETAL STRUCTURAL REORGANIZATION WITHIN A HOST OF ADHERENT MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURES. ALTERED MICROTUBULE ORGANIZATION HAS ENORMOUS SIGNIFICANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF NEURITE OUTGROWTH AND NEURONAL INTRACELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS. INTRACELLULAR EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE THE INABILITY TO CLEAR AGING AND TOXIC PROTEINS  A LOSS OF TROPHIC FACTOR SIGNALING  AND COMPROMISED CELLULAR ENERGETICS  RESULTING IN AXONOPATHIES  SYNAPTIC LOSS  AND EVENTUAL NEURON DEATH. INTRACELLULAR TRAFFICKING OF VESICLES IS A FUNDAMENTAL SUBCELLULAR PROCESS THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER CELLULAR  TISSUE AND SYSTEMIC PROCESSES IF IMPAIRED IN MICROGRAVITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON EARTH HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT DISRUPTED INTRACELLULAR COMMUNICATION CONTRIBUTES TO ABNORMAL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND THAT INTRACELLULAR PROCESSES ARE SENSITIVE TO CYTOSKELETAL ORGANIZATION. THUS  IT IS LIKELY THAT MICROTUBULE REORGANIZATION IN MICROGRAVITY IMPAIRS NEURITE OUTGROWTH  INTRA- AND INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS. HOWEVER  THE EXTENT TO WHICH MICROGRAVITY EFFECTS NEURON MICROTUBULE STRUCTURE DYNAMICS REMAINS UNKNOWN.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF MICROGRAVITY AND PARTIAL MICROGRAVITY ON BONE REMODELING  AS WELL AS EVALUATE HYPERGRAVITY AS A COUNTERMEASURE FOR MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED BONE LOSS. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY (SPACE 0G) AND PARTIAL MICROGRAVITY (MARS 1/3G  MOON 1/6G) WILL IMPAIR BONE REMODELING AND THAT HYPERGRAVITY WILL MITIGATE MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED BONE LOSS. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS THE FACT THAT MICROGRAVITY AND PARTIAL MICROGRAVITY CAUSE BONE LOSS BY REDUCING MECHANICAL STRESSES ON BONE. THEREFORE  THE APPLICATION OF PERIODIC HYPERGRAVITY WILL RESTORE NORMAL BONE STRESSES THEREBY RESCUING PHYSIOLOGICAL REMODELING. FURTHER STUDY WILL ALSO LOOK AT RECOVERY RATE IN DIFFERENT MICROGRAVITY CONDITIONS WITH AND WITHOUT PERIODIC HYPERGRAVITY EXPOSURE.

OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MICROGRAVITY (0G) AND PARTIAL MICROGRAVITY (1/3G AND 1/6G) WILL ALTER BONE REMODELING LEADING TO A LONG-TERM BONE LOSS. MICROCT AND HISTOMORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF BONE FORMATION AND RESORPTION WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE MICROSTRUCTURAL CHANGES. MECHANICAL TESTING WILL BE USED TO ASSESS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY. THE GENOMIC EFFECTS OF MICROGRAVITY WILL BE EVALUATED USING RNASEQ TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED SIGNALING PATHWAYS. LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF SERUM LEVELS OF BONE MARKERS WILL BE CONDUCTED USING ELISA ANALYSIS. 2-ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF PERIODIC HYPERGRAVITY DURING SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY AND PARTIAL MICROGRAVITY AS COUNTERMEASURES TO MITIGATE MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM EFFECTS ON BONE INTEGRITY. OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT HYPERGRAVITY WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL MECHANICAL STIMULATION TO RESTORE MICROGRAVITY AND PARTIAL MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED IMPAIRMENT OF BONE REMODELING. THE EFFICACY OF PERIODIC HYPERGRAVITY WILL BE DETERMINED USING BONE MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSES (MICRO CT  BONE FORMATION  AND RESORPTION HISTOMORPHOMETRY)  MECHANICAL ANALYSIS (THREE-POINT TESTING)  GENOMIC (RNA SEQ)  AND SERUM BIOMARKER ANALYSIS (ELISA).

THUS  THERE EXISTS AN URGENT NEED TO IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS AND IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURES. MICE ARE CURRENTLY THE PREFERRED ANIMAL MODEL FOR EVALUATING ADAPTIVE RESPONSES TO MICROGRAVITY EXPERIENCED DURING SPACEFLIGHT AND SIMULATED SPACEFLIGHT (E.G.  HINDLIMB UNLOADING). MICE HAVE IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER ANIMAL MODELS FOR SPACEFLIGHT STUDIES  INCLUDING SMALL SIZE AND EASE OF GENETIC MANIPULATION. ALTHOUGH MICE AND HUMANS SHARE MANY COMMON CHARACTERISTICS  FUNDAMENTAL SPECIES DIFFERENCES IN THERMOREGULATION MAY CONTRAINDICATE THE MOUSE  AS CURRENTLY APPLIED  AS A MODEL FOR HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT. HUMANS ARE HOMEOTHERMS AND WHEN EXPOSED TO A COLD ENVIRONMENT DEFEND THEIR CORE BODY TEMPERATURE  WHEREAS MICE ARE OBLIGATORY DAILY HETEROTHERMS AND EXPERIENCE CYCLIC CHANGES IN CORE TEMPERATURE WHEN SUBJECTED TO COLD STRESS (I.E.  TEMPERATURE BELOW THERMONEUTRAL). MICE ARE TYPICALLY HOUSED AT OR NEAR ROOM TEMPERATURE (~22C)  WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE THERMONEUTRAL ZONE FOR THE SPECIES (~32C). THEREFORE  MICE MUST EXPEND ENERGY TO MAINTAIN CORE BODY TEMPERATURE. COLD STRESS INDUCED BY SUB-THERMONEUTRAL HOUSING INCREASES SYMPATHETIC OUTFLOW TO PERIPHERAL TISSUES  INCLUDING BROWN ADIPOSE TISSUE  AND HAS PROFOUND EFFECTS ON METABOLISM. WE HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN THAT COLD STRESS INDUCED BY ROOM TEMPERATURE HOUSING RESULTS IN RAPID CANCELLOUS BONE LOSS IN MICE. BASED ON THIS FINDING  WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ACTIVATION OF ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS IN MICE HOUSED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE INTRODUCES UNRECOGNIZED AND UNCONTROLLED CONFOUNDING VARIABLES INTO MOUSE STUDIES. STRATEGIES USED BY WEIGHT-BEARING MICE TO MINIMIZE HEAT LOSS DURING ROOM TEMPERATURE HOUSING (E.G.  HUDDLING OR POSTURAL ADJUSTMENTS) ARE LESS EFFECTIVE DURING SPACEFLIGHT AND SIMULATED SPACEFLIGHT. THIS RESULTS IN INCREASED DEPENDENCE ON ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS  LIKELY EXAGGERATING THE NEGATIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SKELETAL UNLOADING ON BONE AND IMMUNE CELLS. ADDITIONALLY  THE THERMOGENIC MECHANISMS MEDIATING COLD STRESS-INDUCED CHANGES IN METABOLISM IN MICE ARE UNLIKELY TO BE DIRECTLY TRANSLATABLE TO ASTRONAUTS AND COULD THEREFORE CONFOUND INTERPRETATION OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AS APPLICABLE TO HUMANS.

TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOAL  WE PROPOSE 2 SPECIFIC AIMS: SPECIFIC AIM 1: DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF INCREASED ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS TO BONE LOSS DURING HLU IN MICE HOUSED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS AIM BY COMPARING HLU-INDUCED BONE LOSS IN MICE HOUSED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE (22C) WITH MICE HOUSED AT THERMONEUTRAL (32C). SPECIFIC AIM 2: DETERMINE THE LOWEST SUB-THERMONEUTRAL HOUSING TEMPERATURE ABLE TO PREVENT ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED BONE LOSS. WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS AIM BY PERFORMING TEMPERATURE RESPONSE STUDIES (20C-32C) TO EVALUATE INDUCTION OF ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS. ONCE WE IDENTIFY THE LOWEST SUB-THERMONEUTRAL HOUSING TEMPERATURE THAT DOES NOT INDUCE ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS  WE WILL PERFORM A LONG-TERM STUDY TO VERIFY THAT MINIMAL PREMATURE BONE LOSS OCCURS AND THAT MAGNITUDE OF HLU-INDUCED BONE LOSS DOES NOT DIFFER FROM MICE HOUSED AT THERMONEUTRAL.

THE MILLER LAB RECENTLY ESTABLISHED THAT THE MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN STU2P INTERACTS WITH SUMO.

CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO UNLOADING/MICROGRAVITY RESULTS IN A LOSS OF MASS AND STRENGTH OF BOTH BONE AND MUSCLE. SIMILARLY  ACUTE AND CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO MICROGRAVITY LEADS TO A DISRUPTION AND REDISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD FLOW AND ALTERATIONS TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.

BY FIRST EVALUATING THE EFFECT MICROGRAVITY HAS ON 3D ADIPOCYTES ALONE  WE CAN ISOLATE THE METABOLIC EFFECTS INDEPENDENT OF VASCULAR FLOW. UPON CHARACTERIZATION ON THE EFFECT ON ADIPOCYTES ALONE  WE CAN BEGIN TO ADD COMPLEXITY BY CO-CULTURING WITH ENDOTHELIAL CELLS TO PROVIDE A VASCULAR NETWORK.

WHAT IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD  OR EVEN APPROACHED  IS THE TRANS-GENERATIONAL STABILITY OF THESE EPIGENETIC CHANGES  AND WHETHER ESTABLISHING SPACEFLIGHT METHYLATION PATTERNS WITHIN SEEDS CAN IMPROVE NEXT-GENERATION ADAPTABILITY TO SPACEFLIGHT. THEREFORE  THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO EXAMINE THE TRANSMISSION OF DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS THROUGH SEEDS PRODUCED IN PLANTS GROWN ON THE ISS. SEEDS PRODUCED ON ORBIT WILL BE USED FOR SECOND GENERATION OF SPACEFLIGHT GROWTH. THIS SECOND ISS GROW OUT  COMPRISING SEEDS FROM SPACEFLIGHT-GROWN PLANTS TOGETHER WITH SEEDS FROM TERRESTRIALLY-GROWN PLANTS  WILL DETERMINE WHETHER SECOND GENERATION EPIGENETIC CHANGES CONTINUE TO ACCUMULATE OR STABILIZE. THE SECOND GROW OUT WILL ALSO REVEAL ANY SPACEFLIGHT-ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OR GENE REGULATION THAT ARE EPIGENETICALLY REGULATED BETWEEN PLANTS GROWN FROM SEEDS PRODUCED ON THE ISS AND SEEDS PRODUCED ON THE EARTH. THIS EXPERIMENT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER GROWING A GENERATION OF PLANTS IN SPACE CONFERS AN ADAPTIVE ADVANTAGE TO THE NEXT GENERATION  SIMILAR TO EPIGENETIC ADAPTIVE ADVANTAGE KNOWN TO OCCUR WITH SOME TERRESTRIAL PLANT STRESSES. THIS PROJECT IS ONE OF BOTH DISCOVERY ON A GENOME-WIDE SCALE AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO EXPLORATION NEEDS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF MICROGRAVITY ON OSTEOBLAST-OSTEOCLAST COUPLING AND COMMUNICATION IN ORDER TO IDENTITY A COUNTERMEASURE FOR MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED DECOUPLING. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY WILL IMPAIR OSTEOBLAST-OSTEOCLAST COUPLING AND THAT BISPHOSPHONATE (ALENDRONATE) AND/OR ANTI-RANKL ANTIBODY (DENOSUMAB) TREATMENT WILL MITIGATE MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED OSTEOBLAST-OSTEOCLAST DECOUPLING. THE RATIONAL FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS THE FACT THAT MICROGRAVITY PROMOTES OSTEOCLASTIC BONE RESORPTION AND IMPAIRS OSTEOBLASTIC BONE FORMATION. IT IS THEREFORE EXPECTED THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL OSTEOBLASTOSTEOCLAST COUPLING IS IMPAIRED AND THAT DENOSUMAB  A RANKL INHIBITOR WILL RESTORE OSTEOBLAST-OSTEOCLAST COUPLING AND MITIGATE MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED BONE LOSS TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN ALENDRONATE  AN ANTI-CATABOLIC AGENT.

DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY ON OSTEOBLAST-OSTEOCLAST COUPLING AND COMMUNICATION UTILIZING IN VITRO CO-CULTURES. OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MICROGRAVITY WILL ALTER OSTEOBLAST-OSTEOCLAST COMMUNICATION PROCESSES. PATHWAY ANALYSES WILL BE CONDUCTED BY ASSESSING THE DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF MRNA (E.G.

ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF DENOSUMAB RELATIVE TO ALENDRONATE AS A COUNTERMEASURE TO MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED OSTEOBLAST-OSTEOCLAST DECOUPLING IN VITRO. OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT DENOSUMAB WILL BE MORE EFFICACIOUS IN RESTORING MICROGRAVITY-INDUCED IMPAIRMENT OF OSTEOBLASTOSTEOCLAST COUPLING AS IT FUNCTIONS BY BLOCKING EXCESS RANKL  WHILE ALENDRONATE ONLY AFFECTS RESORPTION. OSTEOBLAST-OSTEOCLAST COMMUNICATION WILL BE ASSESSED USING PROTEOMIC AND GENETIC ANALYSIS AND FUNCTION RESTORATION WILL BE ASSESSED USING HISTOLOGY  HISTOMORPHOMETRY  AND CRSEM. SIGNIFICANCE AND OUTCOMES: BONE REMODELING IS A COMPLEX PROCESS THAT IS TIGHTLY REGULATED BY OSTEOBLAST-OSTEOCLAST COUPLING AND COMMUNICATION. MICROGRAVITY IMPAIRS THIS PROCESS BY INCREASING OSTEOCLAST ASSOCIATED RESORPTION AND DECREASING OSTEOBLASTIC BONE FORMATION.

FURTHERMORE  SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY EXPOSURE HAS BEEN SHOWN BY OTHERS TO CAUSE INCREASED MANDIBULAR AND ALVEOLAR BONE LOSS AND DECREASED SALIVA FLOW  FACTORS THAT COULD PREDISPOSE ASTRONAUTS TO CARIES. THEREFORE  THE GOAL OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND GENETIC RESPONSE OF S. MUTANS TO SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY  FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON BIOFILM DEVELOPMENT  STRESS RESISTANCE  AND IDENTIFYING KEY GENE(S) AND/OR THE CORE TRANSCRIPTOMIC RESPONSE THAT FAVORS S. MUTANS SURVIVAL DURING MICROGRAVITY GROWTH. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THREE OBJECTIVES: (1) S. MUTANS WILL BE CULTURED IN BIOFILM-PROMOTING MEDIA UNDER SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY CONDITIONS USING THE LSMMG AND RANDOM-POSITIONING MACHINE (RPM) GROUND-BASED MODELS OF GROWTH. CHANGES IN CELL AGGREGATION  STRESS RESISTANCE  AND GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING (VIA RNASEQ) WILL BE ASSESSED WITH RESPECT TO NORMAL GRAVITY CONTROL CULTURES  AND THESE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED USING BIOINFORMATICS AND STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES. THIS ANALYSIS WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE MORE REFINED PREDICTIONS AS TO WHICH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN S. MUTANS DURING SPACE FLIGHT  AND HOW THIS MAY IMPACT ITS PATHOGENIC POTENTIAL; (2) CHANGES IN S. MUTANS BIOFILM DEVELOPMENT IN RESPONSE TO SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY WILL BE STUDIED USING 2 GROUND-BASED MODELS (LSMMG  RPM). S. MUTANS WILL BE ASSESSED IN THESE MODELS FOR BIOFILM VIABILITY AND ULTRASTRUCTURE  EXOPOLYSACCHARIDE PRODUCTION  AND FOR ITS ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH NON-CARIOGENIC ORAL STREPTOCOCCI; (3) A S. MUTANS TN-SEQ LIBRARY WILL BE SCREENED FOR MUTANTS THAT LOSE COMPETITIVE FITNESS DURING LSMMG AND RPM-BASED SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY GROWTH. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY USING HIGH-THROUGHPUT DNA SEQUENCING OF POOLED BATCHES OF TN MUTANTS PRE- AND POST-HARV GROWTH UNDER BOTH SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY AND NORMAL GRAVITY CONDITIONS. THIS RESEARCH IS DIRECTED AT UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND GENETIC RESPONSE OF S. MUTANS TO MICROGRAVITY  ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO MULTICELLULAR BEHAVIOR (BIOFILM FORMATION)  STRESS RESISTANCE  AND THE GENES THAT FAVOR S. MUTANS SURVIVAL DURING MICROGRAVITY GROWTH.

HOWEVER  PLANTS CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVELY USED FOR SUCH SYSTEMS IF WE HAVE A DEEPER MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS REGULATED BY THE SPACEFLIGHT ENVIRONMENT. RECENT OMICS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PLANTS REPROGRAM THEIR GENETIC CIRCUITRY WHEN GROWN IN THE NEAR WEIGHTLESS CONDITIONS OF SPACE. GENES INVOLVED IN CELL WALL REMODELING AND OXIDATIVE STRESS ARE MAJOR GENE CATEGORIES THAT ARE DIFFERENTIALLY REGULATED BY MICROGRAVITY. FURTHER  IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT TRUE MICROGRAVITY IN SPACE AND SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY USING CLINOSTATS OR RANDOM POSITIONING MACHINES ELICIT ROUGHLY SIMILAR ROOT SKEWING RESPONSES IN THE MODEL PLANT ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA. ROOT SKEWING WAS MORE PRONOUNCED IN MUTANTS TO A ROOTEXPRESSED VEGETATIVE ACTIN ISOFORM. CONSISTENT WITH THE ENHANCED ROOT SKEWING OF ACTIN MUTANTS IN MICROGRAVITY IS THE OBSERVATION THAT OTHER PLANT SPECIES SUCH AS MAIZE (ZEA MAYS L.) HAVE STRONGER ROOT DIRECTIONAL GROWTH RESPONSES ON A CLINOSTAT WHEN CHEMICALS SUCH AS LATRUNCULIN B DISRUPT THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON. BASED ON THESE OBSERVATIONS  WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON IS A KEY PLAYER IN DICTATING ROOT GROWTH DIRECTIONALITY IN TRUE AND SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY BY REGULATING THE PROCESS OF AUTOTROPIC ORGAN STRAIGHTENING.

GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES ARE PRESTIGIOUS INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS OPERATED AND PARTLY FUNDED BY THE NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION OF THE SAME NAME. THE MICROBIOLOGY OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE WAS ADDED TO THE LIST OF GRC S IN 2017. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (1) HOST A SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ON THE FRONTIERS OF MICROBIOLOGY  THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH AND  (2) INDEFINITELY EXTEND  FOSTER AND GROW THE EMERGING SCIENTIFIC  ENGINEERING AND MEDICAL COMMUNITY THAT HAS ASSEMBLED TO STUDY MICROBES AND HUMAN HEALTH IN BUILDINGS.  THE FIELD OF BUILDING MICROBIOLOGY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW DESIGN  USES  OCCUPANCY  AND OPERATION IMPACT HUMAN EXPOSURE TO MICROBES AND ULTIMATELY HOW THESE MICROBIAL EXPOSURES IMPACT WELLBEING. ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS  ARCHITECTS  MICROBIAL ECOLOGISTS  IMMUNOLOGISTS  PHYSICIANS  AND EPIDEMIOLOGISTS POPULATE THIS EMERGING FIELD. A SINGLE CONFERENCE VENUE IS NEEDED TO EXCHANGE RESEARCH RESULTS  BUILD COLLABORATIONS FROM RESEARCHERS IN DISPARATE FIELDS  AND TO FOSTER THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY OF RESEARCHERS. THE MAJOR INNOVATION OF THIS CONFERENCE IS THE FOCUS ON INTEGRATING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH WITH MICROBIAL ASSESSMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH.

LONG TERM HUMAN MISSIONS REQUIRE SUSTAINED CREW HEALTH AND SAFETY. A RESEARCH AREA THAT IS IMPORTANT IN SUSTAINING CREW HEALTH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED SPACEFLIGHT-SUITABLE METHODS FOR MICROBIOLOGICAL MONITORING  AS WELL AS CONTAMINATION CONTROL AND REDUCTION. THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) IS A CONFINED AND ISOLATED HABITAT IN AN EXTREME  HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. THE HUMAN AND HABITAT MICROFLORA VARIES IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ABOARD THE ISS. CHANGES IN THE MICROFLORA MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED HEALTH RISK FOR THE CREW. MICROORGANISMS INCLUDING MICROBIAL BIOFILMS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON VARIOUS HABITAT SURFACES  INSIDE THE AIR AND WATER HANDLING SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE HARDWARE USED ON THE ISS. BIOFILMS ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT FROM POLYMER DETERIORATION  METAL CORROSION AND BIO-FOULING. THE PRIMARY CONCERN REGARDING CREW HEALTH IS CHARACTERIZED BY ACTIVITY OF OPPORTUNISTIC PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTED TO ACCUMULATE IN THE CLOSED ENVIRONMENTS OF THE ISS AND OTHER SPACECRAFT ON LONG-DURATION MISSIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT  ESPECIALLY ALTERED GRAVITY  ON MICROBIAL BIOFILMS IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF LONG-TERM HUMAN SPACE MISSIONS. SURFACE-ASSOCIATED BIOFILM COMMUNITIES WERE ABUNDANT ON THE MIR SPACE STATION AND CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE ON THE ISS. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS LINKED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOFILMS ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN DUE TO THE SUPPRESSION OF HUMAN IMMUNE FUNCTION OBSERVED DURING SPACEFLIGHT. VARIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CERTAIN METALS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CONTACT-MEDIATED MICROBIAL INFECTIONS. ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES ARE DEFINED AS MATERIALS THAT CONTAIN AN ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT SUCH AS SILVER  COPPER AND THEIR ALLOYS THAT INHIBITS OR REDUCES THE ABILITY OF MICROORGANISMS TO GROW ON THE SURFACE OF A MATERIAL. ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES ARE FUNCTIONALIZED IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES. THE INTRODUCTION OF ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES FOR MEDICAL  PHARMACEUTICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES HAS SHOWN THEIR UNIQUE POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING AND PREVENTING MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION. THE CONTACT KILLING OF SEVERAL TYPES OF MICROORGANISMS BY COPPER HAS BEEN ASSESSED IN MULTIPLE LABORATORY INVITRO STUDIES. FOR SUSTAINED CREW HEALTH AND SAFETY ADDITIONAL STUDIES ON THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE FORMATION OF MICROBIAL BIOFILMS AND THEIR EFFICIENT DESTRUCTION UNDER SPACEFLIGHT CONDITIONS  I.E.  LONG-TERM GROWTH AND ADAPTATION TO LOW GRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS  ARE NEEDED. THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED BY METALLICA IS THAT SURFACES CONTAINING COPPER AND/OR SILVER WILL INHIBIT BIOFILM FORMATION UNDER ALTERED GRAVITY REGIMES TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN IN 1 X G DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE INTERACTION WITH THE METAL IONS ON THE SURFACE IS SLOWER BECAUSE THEIR MOVEMENT AROUND THE CELL IS RESTRICTED TO DIFFUSION. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT AND THE RATE  IF ANY  OF COPPER AND/OR SILVER SURFACES ON MICROBIAL GROWTH RATE  TOTAL BIOMASS ACCUMULATION  AND BIOFILM FORMATION. THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBING THE AFFECT OF MICRO-GRAVITY ON BIOFILM FORMATION GROWN ON NON-INHIBITING SURFACES AS WELL AS ON METAL SURFACES THAT ARE POTENTIAL BIOFILM GROWTH INHIBITORS. THE APPROACH WILL BE TO TEST THREE DIFFERENT MICROBIAL MODEL SYSTEMS (I.E.  ESCHERICHIA COLI K12  A STAPHYLOCOCCUS SP. ISOLATE FROM THE ISS  AND THE HEAVY METAL RESISTANT STRAIN CUPRIAVIDUS METALLIDURANS CH34) FOR BIOFILM FORMATION ON VARIOUS COPPER- AND SILVER-SURFACES  AS WELL AS INERT SURFACES AS CONTROLS. THESE SURFACES DIFFER IN THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY BASED ON CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND/OR GEOMETRIC NANOSTRUCTURES. THESE SURFACES WILL BE TESTED FOR BIOFILM FORMATION RATES UNDER DIFFERENT SPACEFLIGHT RELEVANT GRAVITATIONAL REGIMES (E.G.  MOON 0.16 X G  MARS 0.38 X G  G ISS AND 1 X G CONTROL).

PREVIOUS SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHT EXPERIMENTS THAT WE PERFORMED DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION (I.E. PROTEIN PHOSPHORYLATION) REQUIRED FOR ACTIVATION OF SEA URCHIN SPERM OCCUR MORE RAPIDLY IN MICROGRAVITY THAN AT 1G. IN CONTRAST  WE FOUND THAT SIGNALING IN SPERM TRIGGERED BY EGG CHEMOTACTIC FACTORS IS DELAYED IN MICROGRAVITY COMPARED TO 1G. NO FLIGHT-CAPABLE MICROSCOPE WAS AVAILABLE DURING THOSE EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SIGNALING CHANGES WERE IN FACT COUPLED TO DIFFERENCES IN MOTILITY UNDER THE MICROGRAVITY VERSUS 1G CONDITIONS. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS 1) THAT SPERM MOTILITY (SEA URCHIN AND MAMMALIAN) IS ACTIVATED MORE RAPIDLY IN MICROGRAVITY THAN ON EARTH  AND 2) THAT THE RESPONSE OF SEA URCHIN AND MAMMALIAN SPERM (MOTILITY HYPERACTIVATION  AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES) TO FERTILIZATION ACTIVATING CONDITIONS  AS WELL AS THE UNDERLYING METABOLIC AND REGULATORY MECHANISMS  ARE DELAYED OR BLOCKED IN MICROGRAVITY. IN THIS REGARD  IF THE CORRESPONDING ACTIVATION AND CHANGES IN SPERM MOTILITY DO NOT OCCUR  THEN FERTILIZATION CANNOT OCCUR AND REPRODUCTION WILL FAIL. THUS  IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ASSESS WHETHER THE CRITICAL COMPONENT OF SPERM FUNCTION  MOTILITY  AND THE UNDERLYING SIGNALLING AND METABOLIC SUPPORT ARE ALTERED IN SPACE FLIGHT CONDITIONS. WE PROPOSE TO USE EXISTING FLIGHT HARDWARE TO ACTIVATE SEA URCHIN AND RODENT SPERM IN MICROGRAVITY  AND QUANTIFY MULTIPLE PARAMETERS OF MOTILITY AND MORPHOLOGY  COMBINED WITH DETAILED METABOLOMIC PATHWAY ANALYSIS. PREVIOUSLY UTILIZED METHODS FOR PREPARING INACTIVE SEA URCHIN SPERM FOR SUBSEQUENT ACTIVATION IN SPACE FLIGHT WILL BE ADAPTED FOR MOUSE AND RAT SPERM.

A PROMISING CONCEPT IS TO MIX PETROLEUM FUELS WITH BIO-DERIVED FUELS. AN EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE BENEFITS RESTS ON DIAGNOSTICS TO UNRAVEL THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOOT FORMATION AND FUEL PROPERTIES. UNDER SOME CONDITIONS THE PRESENCE OF SOOT ITSELF IN THE COMBUSTION FIELD CAN INTRUDE ON THIS EFFORT. MEASUREMENTS THAT RELY ON DIGITAL VIDEO IMAGING OF THE FUEL BURNING PROCESS  SUCH AS EMPLOYED IN THE FLAME EXTINGUISHMENT EXPERIMENT (FLEX)  ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS CONCERN. FLEX WAS DEVELOPED TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL FLAME EXTINCTION AS IT RELATES TO CABIN FIRE SAFETY ABOARD MANNED SPACEFLIGHT  THOUGH THE BROAD METHODOLOGIES ARE MORE WIDELY APPLICABLE TO COMBUSTION OF FUEL SYSTEMS IN COMBUSTION ENGINES. THE CONFIGURATION OF ISOLATED DROPLETS BURNING WITH NEAR SPHERICAL SYMMETRY WAS EMPLOYED TO ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED. THE MAIN DIAGNOSTIC WAS DIGITAL VIDEO IMAGING. FROM THIS INFORMATION  QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF THE DROPLET AND FLAME BOUNDARIES WERE MADE USING SUITABLE COMPUTER-BASED DATA EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS THAT REVEALED THE INFLUENCE OF AMBIENT GAS CONDITIONS AND LIQUID FUEL PROPERTIES ON FLAME EXTINCTION. FOR SOME OF THE FUELS EMPLOYED IN FLEX  SOOT FORMATION WAS EVIDENT (I.E.  N-HEPTANE DROPLETS BURNING IN AIR) WHICH OBSCURED PART OF THE DROPLET AND FLAME BOUNDARY THAT CAN COMPROMISE DATA ACCURACY. THE SUCCESS OF THE FLEX PROGRAM ASSUMES THE EXISTENCE OF EFFICIENT AND ACCURATE COMPUTER-BASED ALGORITHMS THAT CAN OVERCOME THE OBSCURATION INFLUENCE OF SOOT ON DROPLETS  ARE ABLE TO TRACK DROPLETS IF THEY MOVE  AND CAN ACCOUNT FOR DEVIATIONS FROM SPHERICITY DUE TO IGNITION DISTURBANCES. HOWEVER  THIS IS NOT THE CASE. COMMERCIAL IMAGE ANALYSIS PACKAGES ARE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THE PRESENCE OF SOOT IN THE IMAGING FIELD WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT USER INPUT. FAILURE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IMPACTS NOT ONLY DERIVING FULL BENEFIT FROM THE FLEX EXPERIMENTS ALREADY CARRIED OUT  BUT ALSO FOLLOW-ON STUDIES WHICH WOULD UTILIZE DIGITAL VIDEO IMAGING TO STUDY DROPLET COMBUSTION DYNAMICS OF SOOTING FUELS USED IN COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BE DEVELOPING A DIAMETER ESTIMATION REFINEMENT ALGORITHM THAT EMPLOYS CONCEPTS WHICH AUTOMATE DROPLET AND FLAME DIAMETER MEASUREMENTS FROM VIDEO IMAGES IN THE PRESENCE OF SOOT.

THE ORIGINAL WORK FOUND THAT SELFASSEMBLY WAS GREATLY ACCELERATED BY UTILIZING A SIMPLE OPEN-LOOP CONTROL SCHEME OF THE MAGNETIC INTERACTIONS. THIS METHODOLOGY OFFERS ONE SOLUTION TO THE DIFFICULT ENGINEERING CHALLENGE OF DEVELOPING SCALABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE FABRICATION METHODS FOR STRUCTURED NANOMATERIALS WITH PROVEN APPLICATIONS IN OPTOELECTRONICS  ENERGY STORAGE AND HARVESTING  BIOLOGICAL SENSING  3D PRINTING  AND HIGHPERFORMANCE COATINGS. HOWEVER  BECAUSE OF LIMITED SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IN THE EXPERIMENTS  DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE SELFASSEMBLED STRUCTURES WAS IMPOSSIBLE. A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF OUT-OF-EQUILIBRIUM SELF-ASSEMBLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE INSPACE SUITE IS NEEDED BEFORE IT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO DESIGN PROCESSES THAT RAPIDLY PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY NANOMATERIALS. THE PROPOSED WORK HAS TWO MAIN OBJECTIVES. FIRST  WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INSIGHTS DEVELOPED SINCE THE INSPACE EXPERIMENTS FOR OTHER OUT-OF-EQUILIBRIUM ASSEMBLIES TO RE-EVALUATE THE INSPACE DATA IN THE PSI SYSTEM. THIS WILL REVEAL NEW RESULTS THAT THE ORIGINAL INSPACE TEAM WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN. SECOND  WE WILL USE THE INSPACE DATA IN THE PSI SYSTEM TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF NANOPARTICLE SELF-ASSEMBLY IN TIME-VARYING FIELDS AND USE THAT MODEL TO EXTEND THE INVESTIGATION OF TOGGLED MAGNETIC FIELD ASSEMBLY BEYOND THE PARAMETER SPACE EXPLORED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SUITE. THIS WILL AID IN DEVELOPING A PREDICTIVE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR DYNAMIC SELF-ASSEMBLY THAT CAN FACILITATE DESIGN OF RAPID NANOMATERIAL SYNTHESES. THE WORK WILL UTILIZE GPU-ACCELERATED DISCRETE ELEMENT SIMULATIONS OF PARTICLE SELF-ASSEMBLY DRIVEN BY MAGNETIC FIELDS WITH DETAILED MODELS OF THE MAGNETIC AND HYDRODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS AMONG THE PARTICLES. THE PI S  LABORATORY HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED NEW ALGORITHMS FOR MODELING THESE INTERACTIONS THAT HAVE ACCELERATED SIMULATIONS BY ROUGHLY A FACTOR OF 100 TIMES. CONSEQUENTLY  DISCRETE ELEMENT SIMULATIONS OF THE HIERARCHICAL SELF-ASSEMBLIES OBSERVED IN THE INSPACE EXPERIMENTS ARE POSSIBLE. THE VIDEO MICROGRAPHS FROM INSPACE ARE OF LIMITED SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION  THEREFORE  SIMULATIONS CAPABLE OF RESOLVING THE PARTICLE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS ON A LOCAL SCALE WHILE REPLICATING STRUCTURE AND GROWTH KINETICS ON LARGER LENGTH SCALES AND LONGER TIME SCALES PROVIDE ADDITION INSIGHT INTO THE INSPACE DATA. THE ABILITY TO TRANSLATE INSPACE MICROGRAVITY DATA FOR THE MANY-BODIED  DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS AMONG SELF-ASSEMBLING PARTICLES INTO WELL-VALIDATED MODELS FOR THE SAME EXPERIMENTS WILL ENABLE SIMULATIONS TO PREDICT AND THEN DESIGN DYNAMIC SELF-ASSEMBLY PROCESSES TERRESTRIALLY AS WELL AS DURING CONTINUED SPACE OPERATIONS. THE PI S LABORATORY HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED A PREDICTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR OTHER TYPES OF TOGGLED SELF-ASSEMBLY AND IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THEORIES FOR THE INSPACE ASSEMBLY THAT CAN BE USED TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME AND QUANTIFY THE ROBUSTNESS OF DYNAMICAL SELF-ASSEMBLY PROCESSES.

A RECENT REPORT ALSO SHOWS THAT MORE THAN 50% OF THE ASTRONAUTS RETURNING FROM SPACE WERE DIAGNOSED WITH EYE PROBLEMS THAT CAN CAUSE HEADACHES AND BLURRY VISION. THE HEALTH RISKS OF SPACE FLIGHT ASSOCIATED SKIN DAMAGE AND CARCINOGENESIS HAVE LONG BEEN A CONCERN.
