THEIR LIFE HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS ARE LESS UNDERSTOOD THAN ARE THOSE OF OTHER WATERFOWL BUT DATA SUGGEST THEY MAY BE VULNERABLE TO OVERHARVEST AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. EFFORTS TO CONSERVE AND MANAGE SEA DUCKS REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF POPULATION DELINEATION AS IT RELATES TO THEIR HARVEST. HOWEVER, SUCH INFORMATION IS OFTEN UNAVAILABLE ACROSS THE LARGE BREEDING-RANGES OF MOST SEA-DUCK SPECIES, PARTICULARLY FOR JUVENILES. A PRIOR SDJV-FUNDED PROJECT INDICATED THAT STABLE HYDROGEN ISOTOPE RATIOS ARE A PROMISING TOOL FOR IDENTIFYING THE BREEDING GROUNDS OF HUNTER-HARVESTED LONG-TAILED DUCKS AND SURF SCOTERS. WE HEREIN PROPOSE TO EXPAND UPON THOSE RESULTS TO ASSESS (1) VARIATION IN THE LOCATION OF BREEDING HABITAT ACROSS FLYWAYS AND (2) THE POTENTIAL OF COASTAL MARINE HABITAT AS FLEDGLING AREAS. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE TO (1) INCREASE FEATHER SAMPLE SIZES AND FILL GEOGRAPHIC GAPS FOR HUNTER-HARVESTED JUVENILE LONG-TAILED DUCKS AND SURF SCOTERS, (2) STABLE CARBON, NITROGEN, AND SULFUR VALUES TO IDENTIFY BIRDS PROVISIONED FROM TERRESTRIAL FRESHWATER VS. COASTAL MARINE HABITATS DURING THE PERIOD OF FEATHER GROWTH, (3) USE 2H VALUES TO CREATE A LIKELIHOOD-OF-ORIGIN MAP TO IDENTIFY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE INDIVIDUALS PROVISIONED FROM TERRESTRIAL FRESHWATER ENVIRONMENTS FLEDGED, (4) EVALUATE HYPOTHESES ABOUT VARIATION IN THE LOCATION OF FLEDGING GROUNDS OF THESE SPECIES AMONG FLYWAYS. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PROPOSE TO MEASURE STABLE HYDROGEN, CARBON, NITROGEN, AND SULFUR VALUES VALUES OF FEATHERS FROM  200 HUNTER-HARVESTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE SDJVS FEATHER ARCHIVE AND COMBINE THEM WITH EXISTING ISOTOPE DATA FROM 120 HUNTER-HARVESTED INDIVIDUALS.

THE INVESTMENTS BY ALL THE PARTNERS OF THE RGJV CONTRIBUTE TO THE USFWS'S ABILITY TO MEET THEIRTRUST RESPONSIBILITIES, NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES, AND INTERNATIONAL TREATY COMMITMENTS FORCONSERVING MIGRATORY BIRDS. IN ADDITION, CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE HEALTHY BIRD POPULATIONS PROVIDERECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR BIRD-WATCHING, PHOTOGRAPHY, HUNTING, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT BENEFITLANDOWNERS, BUSINESSES, AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE RGJV GEOGRAPHY. THE RGJV BUILDS RELATIONSHIPS WITH PARTNERS TOFACILITATE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN CONSERVING ECOSYSTEMS FOR THE BENEFIT OF BIRDS, OTHER WILDLIFE, AND PEOPLE.THE RGJV IS CRITICAL FOR MEETING CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES FOR MANY SPECIES OF CONTINENTAL IMPORTANCE AS DETAILEDIN THE RECENT PARTNERS IN FLIGHT CONTINENTAL PLAN (ROSENBERG ET AL. 2016). THE RGJV GEOGRAPHY PROVIDES HABITATSFOR 17 WATCH LIST SPECIES THREE RED LEVEL AND 14 YELLOW LEVEL - AS WELL AS 10 COMMON SPECIES IN STEEP DECLINE.RGJV IS A HIGHLY IMPORTANT AREA FOR MANY OF THESE SPECIES IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE AND SUSTAINED CONSERVATIONATTENTION ATTENTION.WITH CONTINUED SUPPORT FROM THE USFWS, THE RGJV WILL CONTINUE TO FACILITATE SUCCESSES IN COORDINATED ANDCOLLABORATIVE CONSERVATION EFFORTS ACROSS THE 63 MILLION ACRES OF THE RGJV REGION. SPECIFICALLY, EVEN AS THE RGJVCONTINUES TO MEET OBJECTIVES OUTLINED IN THE CURRENT (2018-2022) STRATEGIC PLAN, IN FY2022 THE RGJV WILL BEGINWORK ON A NEW 5-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WILL GUIDE WORK FROM 2023-2027 WHILE CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT IDENTIFIEDHIGHEST PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR BIRD CONSERVATION IN THE GRASSLANDS, RIPARIAN AREAS, AND WETLANDS ACROSS OURGEOGRAPHY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "81feef0b-fad1-5c3a-58b5-9b17eeb4be12-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F22AC01804_1448"}, {"internal_id": 150045063, "Award ID": "F22AC01798", "Award Amount": 944851.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-07-13", "CFDA Number": "15.637", "Description": "THE OAKS AND PRAIRIES JOINT VENTURE (OPJV) IS A VOLUNTARY, NON-REGULATORY PARTNERSHIP OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE  ORGANIZATIONS, AND INTERESTED IN STRATEGICALLY COORDINATED CONSERVATION OF BIRDS AND THEIR HABITATS IN THE OAKS  AND PRAIRIES AND EDWARDS PLATEAU BIRD CONSERVATION REGIONS (BCR) OF CENTRAL TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA.

HOWEVER, THE JURISDICTIONAL COMPLEXITY PRESENTS A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO TAKING AN ECOSYSTEM SCALE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM, NOT LEAST BECAUSE MANY INFORMATION SOURCES (I.E., BIOLOGICAL DATASETS) END AT THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER. WE AIM TO OVERCOME THIS BARRIER BY HARMONIZING INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT ASSISTS THE AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING CONSERVATION PRESCRIPTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF KEY HABITATS. IN DOING SO, OUR PROJECT WILL ELEVATE SEA DUCK NEEDS INTO CONSERVATION PLANNING PROCESSES, THROUGH CONVENING A NETWORK OF SCIENTISTS AND MANAGERS FROM BOTH CANADIAN AND U.S. JURISDICTIONS OF THE SALISH SEA.TO ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVE, WE WILL IMPLEMENT A THREE-PHASE PLAN TO LEVERAGE A RANGE OF EXISTING RESOURCES FOCUSED AROUND TWO SEA DUCK HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELING INITIATIVES, ONE IN BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ONE IN WASHINGTON. IN PHASE 1, WE WILL ENGAGE A GROUP OF EXPERIENCED ANALYSTS WORKING ON SEA DUCKS AND THE HABITATS THAT SEA DUCKS USE, TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS COMPATIBILITY OF RELEVANT BIRD AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATASETS, AND ASSESS LONG-TERM SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN BALD EAGLES AND PRIORITY SEA DUCK SPECIES.
