DELIVER ENGAGING, REALISTIC, AND IMMERSIVE TABLETOP SIMULATIONS AT THE CONCLUSION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE OPERATIONS AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZWOPER) RECERTIFICATION TO SUPPORT HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (HAZMAT) WORKER AND FIRST RESPONDER SAFETY AND ADHERENCE TO PROTOCOL IN THE FIELD. THIS EXERCISE OFTEN BURDENS INSTRUCTORS TO DELIVER A PAPER OR POWERPOINT SIMULATION THAT, ALTHOUGH BASED ON REAL EVENTS, FAILS TO MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE OR IMMERSE TRAINEES. WHEN TRAINEES FAIL TO ENGAGE, THEY ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES AND OTHERS AT RISK BY DECREASING THEIR ABILITY TO ADHERE TO PROTOCOL WHEN RESPONDING TO HAZMAT INCIDENTS IN THE FIELD. THEREFORE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRE A COST-EFFECTIVE TRAINING SOLUTION THAT INCREASES THE REALISM AND AUTHENTICITY OF TABLETOP SIMULATIONS TO BETTER EQUIP TRAINEES TO EXECUTE HAZWOPER SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY WHEN THEY ARE IN THE FIELD.  CHARLES RIVER ANALYTICS, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NEW ENGLAND CONSORTIUM AND LT. MICHAEL KATES OF THE BOSTON FIRE DEPARTMENT, PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE AN IMMERSIVE MODULAR PREPAREDNESS INTELLIGENT TUTOR (IMPRINT).

IMPRINT WILL BE AN UNTETHERED INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM (ITS) USING THE OCULUS QUEST VR HEADSET TO PROVIDE AN IMMERSIVE, VIRTUAL TRAINING EXPERIENCE. WITH IMPRINT, TRAINEES CAN APPLY COMPLEX, DANGEROUS PROCEDURES IN A SAFE, CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT THROUGH GUIDED AND IMMERSIVE PROCEDURE REHEARSAL. IN PHASE II, WE WILL PRODUCE A SYSTEM THAT COMPLEMENTS EXISTING TRAINING WITH A PRODUCTION READY VR CASE STUDY DEVELOPMENT SUITE AND A LIBRARY OF VR CASE STUDIES THAT REPLACE STANDARD PAPER AND POWERPOINT SCENARIO-BASED ACTIVITIES USED TO PREPARE TRAINEES FOR HANDS-ON ASSESSMENTS AND THEIR FINAL HAZWOPER QUALIFICATION TEST.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "18a1d77c-196c-ded4-b89d-ea78f0d2fb01-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44ES031818_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151143769, "Award ID": "R44ES030580", "Award Amount": 400000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-05", "CFDA Number": "93.142", "Description": "AGILE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE, INTERACTIVE HAZARD RECOGNITION AND MITIGATION TOOLS/LEARNING E-PLATFORMS FOR WORKERS INVOLVED IN DISASTER RESCUE AND RECOVERY. - ABSTRACT WORKERS INVOLVED IN POST-FLOOD RECONSTRUCTION FACE AN INCREASED RISK OF OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO RESPIRATORY AND OTHER SAFETY HAZARDS AS WELL AS THREATS TO THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY (I.E., EXPLOITATION, WAGE THEFT, AND WAGE DISCRIMINATION). POST-FLOOD RECONSTRUCTION IS OFTEN HANDLED BY DAY LABORERS WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING AND WHO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO SAFETY TRAINING AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.

TEAM-BASED HAZMAT TRAINING EXERCISES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO YIELD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PREPAREDNESS WHEN COMPARED TO INDIVIDUAL NON-COLLABORATIVE TRAINING. HOWEVER, FOR SEVERAL REASONS, THE MORE FREQUENT 8-HOUR REFRESHER COURSES LACK TEAM-BASED FIELD EXERCISES. FIRST, SET-UP/TEAR-DOWN TIME FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE (~1 HOUR) WOULD CONSUME A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE 8 HOURS. SECOND, IN RESPONSE TO PANDEMIC PROTOCOLS AND EMERGING WORKER AND INSTRUCTOR PREFERENCES, TRAINING ORGANIZATIONS NOW OFFER MOST 8-HOUR REFRESHER COURSES VIRTUALLY IN A SYNCHRONOUS ONLINE FORMAT. THIRD, HAZMAT VIDEO SIMULATORS ARE CURRENTLY SINGLE USER GAMES WITH NO INTERACTIVITY BETWEEN LEARNERS, AND REQUIRE EACH TRAINING ORGANIZATION AND LEARNER TO INSTALL EXPENSIVE VIDEO GAME SOFTWARE - AND SOMETIMES HARDWARE LIKE VR GOGGLES. INSTEAD, INSTRUCTORS USE A CASE STUDY APPROACH WHEREBY CERTAIN ASPECTS OF A CURRENT HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE ARE REVEALED TO THE STUDENTS, WHO THEN ARE REQUIRED TO DISCUSS HOW THEY WOULD RESPOND.

THE PROPOSED EXPERIENTIAL WORKER TRAINING TOOL EXPLOITS RECENT ADVANCES IN WEB STANDARDS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE MULTIPLE SIGNIFICANT INNOVATIONS. FIRST, IT IS THE FIRST BROWSER-BASED HAZMAT TRAINING TOOL TO PROVIDE TEAM-BASED HAZMAT FIELD EXERCISES. THUS, ANY PERSON OR TRAINING ORGANIZATION WITH A WEB-ENABLED DEVICE CAN USE THE TOOL, AND NO INSTALLATION OF HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE IS REQUIRED. SECOND, THE TRAINING TOOL IS INTUITIVE. TEAM MEMBERS IN THE VIRTUAL FIELD EXERCISES COMMUNICATE VIA ZOOM, WHICH IS INTEGRATED WITH THE TEACHING TOOL. THIRD, EVERY STUDENT EXPERIENCES HER/HIS INDIVIDUAL REALISTIC AND IMMERSIVE 3D VIEW OF THE COMMON TRAINING SCENARIO, INCLUDING A VIRTUAL CHEMICAL AND RADIATION EXPOSURE SENSOR. FOURTH, AS WITH IN- PERSON EXERCISES, THE INSTRUCTOR HAS THE ABILITY TO DYNAMICALLY INTERJECT EVENTS DURING THE EXERCISE, SUCH AS CHANGE IN THE INTENSITY OF A HAZARDOUS SPILL OR ON-THE-SPOT QUESTIONS, TO ASSESS STUDENTS AND KEEP THEM ENGAGED.

PHASE I OBJECTIVES INCLUDE:  \u00b7 DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE/PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR A REALISTIC FIELD SURVEY TEAM TRAINING GAME WITH  INPUTS FROM RADIOLOGICAL MODELING SOFTWARE  \u00b7 VALIDATE THE VALUES IN THE SIMULATION GAME AGAINST THE MODELING SOFTWARE OUTPUTS TO  ENSURE PROPER SURVEY DATA AND LOCATION ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE DATA  \u00b7 SURVEY THE COMMUNITY FOR FEEDBACK ON THE USABILITY OF THE SIMULATION GAME AS TRAINING  DELIVERY AND INTEREST IN FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS OR OTHER TYPES OF REALISTIC GAME-BASED  TRAINING THAT WOULD BE IDEAL FOR RADIOLOGICAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE LONG TERM/FUTURE PHASE OBJECTIVES INCLUDE:  \u00b7 EXPANDING INTO ADDITIONAL CRITICAL TRAINING AREAS, SUCH AS FIELD TEAM SAMPLING OF WATER,  SOIL, AND VEGETATION.  \u00b7 LEVERAGING VIRTUAL REALITY PLATFORMS FOR ALL TRAINING OPTIONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NV", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6726e3db-135f-f639-5267-491b6e5a650c-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43ES033072_7529"}, {"internal_id": 97015600, "Award ID": "R43ES031818", "Award Amount": 184795.81, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-04-30", "CFDA Number": "93.142", "Description": "IMMERSIVE MODULAR PREPAREDNESS INTELLIGENT TUTOR (IMPRINT)", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 99892.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "18a1d77c-196c-ded4-b89d-ea78f0d2fb01-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43ES031818_7529"}, {"internal_id": 79433898, "Award ID": "R43ES030582", "Award Amount": 167222.82, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-04-02", "CFDA Number": "93.142", "Description": "PREVENTING OPIOID EXPOSURE TRAINING (POET) FOR FIRST RESPONDERS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": 67256.42, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4cde5618-3813-a4a1-6e41-ee865b132bfa-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43ES030582_7529"}, {"internal_id": 85589835, "Award ID": "R43ES030580", "Award Amount": 156278.75, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-19", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "EXTENDING A DIGITAL RISK MITIGATION INTERVENTION FOR WORKERS DEPLOYED IN DIVERSE POST-FLOOD ENVIRONMENTS TO ADDRESS UNIQUE SAR-COV-2 VIRUS INFECTION EXPOSURE RISKS IN CONSTRUCTION WORKPLACES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": 58317.83, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fff8e22a-ecad-1885-d9a5-ae95e8c6fa27-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43ES030580_7529"}, {"internal_id": 81395868, "Award ID": "R43ES030578", "Award Amount": 93999.99, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-06-05", "CFDA Number": "93.142", "Description": "ENABLING REALISTIC HAZMAT TRAINING SIMULATIONS WITH THE PERSIM?
