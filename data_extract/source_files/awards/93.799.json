HARAMBEE IS THE SWAHILI WORD FOR ?PULLING TOGETHER?. ITS NAME SIGNIFIES TWO THINGS: THE AFRICAN HERITAGE OF MOST RESIDENTS AND THE SPIRIT OF UNITY THAT HAS TAKEN ROOT IN AN OLD NEIGHBORHOOD. DRAPED ACROSS A STEEP RIDGE OVERLOOKING DOWNTOWN, THE HARAMBEE AREA IS A COMMUNITY OF HISTORIC HOMES AND STRONG CHURCHES. THIS URBAN MILWAUKEE NEIGHBORHOOD IS LOCATED AND DEFINED AS: 7TH STREET TO HUMBOLDT BLVD (WEST-EAST) & WALNUT/PLEASANT STREET TO CAPITOL DRIVE (SOUTH TO NORTH) AND CURRENTLY HOLDS A POPULATION OF 9,787.

JOHNS CREEK IS ONE OF SIX CITIES IN NORTH FULTON COUNTY AND RANKED AS THE 10TH LARGEST CITY IN GEORGIA. THE 31 SQUARE-MILE REGION HAS A POPULATION OF 84,310 AS OF JULY 1, 2018 (US CENSUS BUREAU) AND APPROXIMATELY 9,500 STUDENTS IN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL (2019 FULTON COUNTY STUDENT ENROLLMENT DATA). THE RACE AND ORIGIN ARE AS FOLLOWS:  WHITE 55%, BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN 9.4%, ASIAN 26.7%, TWO OR MORE RACES 2.8%, AND HISPANIC OR LATINO 6.4%. THE COMMUNITY IS CHARACTERIZED BY A THRIVING ECONOMIC CLIMATE, ABOVE-AVERAGE SCHOOLS, BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC, TWO-EARNER HOMES WITH AN ABOVE-AVERAGE MEDIAN INCOME OF $100,000 AND A 30 TO 45-MINUTE COMMUTE TO WORK. THERE ARE 3 PUBLIC HIGH AND 3 PUBLIC MIDDLE SCHOOLS AS WELL AS PRIVATELY FUNDED SCHOOLS SERVING THE CITY?S STUDENT POPULATION.   WHILE THE DESCRIPTION OF JOHNS CREEK AT FIRST READ APPEARS TO BE AN IDYLLIC, INDICATIVE OF MINIMAL CONCERN THE REALITY IS THAT SUBSTANCE MISUSE AND ITS DEVASTATING IMPACT KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES AND IS VERY MUCH A PART OF THE DYNAMICS THAT ARE ADVERSELY IMPACTING YOUTH, YOUNG ADULTS AS WELL AS OLDER ADULTS. WITH PRIVILEGE COMES DISCONNECTION AS BUSY LIVES, DIFFUSED FAMILY STRUCTURES, ACCESS TO SUBSTANCES AND DEMAND FOR ABOVE-AVERAGE PERFORMANCE EQUALS AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO RISKY AND SELF-SOOTHING BEHAVIORS THAT TOO OFTEN LEAD TO SUBSTANCE USE/MISUSE AND CATASTROPHIC CIRCUMSTANCES. JOHNS CREEK, AS A PART OF THE ?HEROIN TRIANGLE? WHERE HEROIN OVERDOSE IS CONCERNING, IS AN AREA OF SIGNIFICANT ILLEGAL DRUG USE INCLUDING METHAMPHETAMINES WITH INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE BASED ON THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND EXCESS FINANCIAL RESOURCES. ALTHOUGH THE COMMUNITY IS A RESOURCED AREA WITH A LARGE VARIETY OF SUBSTANCES AVAILABLE, THERE CURRENTLY EXISTS NO COMPREHENSIVE AND CONNECTED SYSTEM TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES SURROUNDING METHAMPHETAMINES, OPIOIDS AND/OR PRESCRIPTION DRUG MISUSE WHERE STUDENTS PROGRESS FRO M TAKING LEGAL PRESCRIPTIONS TO ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE MISUSE AND ABUSE PATTERNS.

THIS GRANT TARGETS THE MISUSE OF OPIOIDS AND PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS BY WEST HAVEN (WH) YOUTH AND SEEKS TO ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF THE WHPC AND OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. ONE SOURCE OF CONCERN DRIVING THIS INITIATIVE IS THE RISE IN THE RATE OF FATAL OPIOID OVERDOSES THAT WH HAS SUSTAINED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. BETWEEN 2013 AND 2018, THE RATE OF OPIOID-INVOLVED DEATHS IN WH EXCEEDED THE NATIONAL RATE IN EVERY YEAR EXCEPT 2018, WHEN THE RATES WERE THE SAME. MORE RECENT DATA ON NON-FATAL OVERDOSES DISCLOSES THAT DURING 2018-20, THE WEST HAVEN RATE INCREASED BY 22%, AND EXCEEDED THE STATE RATE IN THE TWO YEARS FOR WHICH DATA ARE AVAILABLE. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, PREVENTION EFFORTS IN SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY ARE CRITICAL, SINCE THEY ARE THE BEST WAY TO CURB MORE SERIOUS OPIOID DISORDERS BEFORE THEY START. THE FIRST OF THE RISK FACTORS STUDENTS FACE, ACCORDING TO SCHOOL SURVEYS, IS THAT NEARLY A QUARTER OF THEM DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE DANGERS POSED BY OPIOIDS. A SECOND RISK FACTOR IS EASY ACCESS TO OPIOIDS AND PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES NOT PRESCRIBED TO THEM. ONE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT WH IS LOCATED IN THE NEW ENGLAND HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREA, OFFERING DIRECT ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE NORTHEAST/I-95 DRUG CORRIDOR. HOTELS AND MOTELS ADJACENT TO THESE HIGHWAYS ARE OFTEN HOT SPOTS OF DRUG USE AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. THE LARGE BEACH AREA (OVER 14 MILES OF SHORELINE) MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO LIMIT DRUG ACTIVITY AND RELATED BEHAVIOR, ACCORDING TO POLICE. ANOTHER REASON FOR READY ACCESS IS THAT NEARLY A THIRD OF STUDENTS REPORT NO CLEAR PARENTAL RULES OR RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. A THI RD RISK FACTOR IS THE HIGH LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES STUDENTS REPORT. NEARLY 40% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED BEING \u201cSAD OR HOPELESS SO MUCH THAT IT STOPPED ME FROM DOING MY USUAL ACTIVITIES\u201d IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, COMPARED TO 30.5% AND 31.5% IN CONNECTICUT AND THE U.S., RESPECTIVELY. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AGGRAVATE SUBSTANCE MISUSE ACROSS THE BOARD. THE STUDENTS WHO REPORTED FEELING \u201cSAD OR HOPELESS\u201d ABOVE HAD A RATE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG MISUSE 3.5 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE.  FINALLY, THE LIFETIME RATES OF PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICINE MISUSE OF BLACK AND HISPANIC STUDENTS, WHO COMPRISE 62% OF THE STUDENT BODY, EXCEED THE NON-HISPANIC WHITE RATE BY 60% &AMP; 78%, RESPECTIVELY. TO PROTECT STUDENTS FROM THESE RISKS, OUR PROGRAM HAS TWO GOALS: THE FIRST IS TO REDUCE ABUSE OF OPIOIDS AND PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS BY WEST HAVEN YOUTH, WITH A FOCUS ON REDUCING ACCESS, INCREASING PERCEPTION OF HARM, AND ENHANCING PARENTAL GUIDANCE. THE SECOND IS TO ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF THE WHPC AND OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. WE WILL REDUCE ACCESS BY PROMOTING DRUG TAKE-BACK DAYS, DISPOSAL KIT DISTRIBUTION, MEDICINE DROP BOXES, AND BY EDUCATING WH PROVIDERS ON THE STATE-CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE MONITORING SYSTEM TO REDUCE THE DANGER OF OVERPRESCRIBING. WE WILL DELIVER OPIOID RISK AND HARM INFORMATION TO STUDENTS, PARENTS, AND WH RESIDENTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS, AND INITIATE AN SBIRT SCREENING PROGRAM FOR 9TH GRADERS TO IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT YOUTH IN NEED. TO ENHANCE PARENTAL &AMP; ADULT GUIDANCE OF STUDENTS, WE WILL CONDUCT SEVERAL ACTIVITIES FOR PARENTS AND RESIDENTS ON OPIOID HARM AND MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. TO ACHIEVE THE SECOND GOAL \u2013 CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT \u2013 WE WILL PROVIDE TRAINING TO COALITION SECTOR LEADERS ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT OPIOID-RELATED PREVENTION INITIATIVES WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITY SECTORS, AND REACH OUT TO REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL AGENCIES TO EDUCATE AND STRENGTHEN COLLABORATION, INCLUDING WEST HAVEN CITY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6793db82-43e8-32cd-ab1f-89023da054ed-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE003307_7523"}, {"internal_id": 138341707, "Award ID": "NH28CE003306", "Award Amount": 150000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-30", "CFDA Number": "93.799", "Description": "WESTCARE AND THE PROMISE ZONE COALITION WORKING TOGETHER TO PREVENT OPIOID, METHAMPHETAMINE USE, AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE/MISUSE AMONG YOUTH AGES 12-18 IN THE EAST SIDE PROMISE ZONE. - WESTCARE FOUNDATION, INC.

LAS VEGAS IS A UNIQUE PLACE TO LIVE AND RAISE A FAMILY. HERE WE HAVE A RATE OF ADDICTION THAT IS HIGHER THAN NATIONAL AVERAGES AND IS ALL PART OF THE VEGAS CULTURE. WE HOLD SOME OF THE LOOSEST DRINKING LAWS IN THE COUNTRY, WITH NO RESTRICTIVE OPEN CONTAINER LAWS AND NO SOCIAL HOST LAWS, EVERYWHERE CAN BE A PARTY. THIS IS FURTHER PERPETUATED BY THE FACT THAT LAS VEGAS AND CLARK COUNTY OPERATE ON A TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR CLOCK; ALCOHOL CAN BE ACCESSED AT ANY TIME OF ANY DAY VIA LIQUOR STORES, CONVENIENCE STORES, AND GROCERY OUTLETS. THERE IS NO ?LAST CALL?,, AND THEREFORE NO NEED TO END THE PARTY. THE ENVIRONMENT AND TOURIST CULTURE IN LAS VEGAS LENDS ITSELF TO THE NORMALIZATION OF SUBSTANCE USE. FROM AN?EARLY AGE CHILDREN?ARE EXPOSED TO MEDIA AND MARKETING PROMOTING SUBSTANCE USE. TEENS LEARN TO DRIVE ON FREEWAYS WHERE IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE BILLBOARDS DISPLAYING PHRASES SUCH AS, ?ALCOHOL: IT?S CHEAPER THAN THERAPY?, ENCOURAGING LIQUOR SALES, A FEATURE UNIQUE TO LAS VEGAS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.  ?LAS VEGAS, OR MORE SPECIFICALLY THE CLARK COUNTY REGION, HAS SEEN A SIGNIFICANT SPIKE IN FENTANYL IN THE PAST 12-24 MONTHS. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS HAS COINCIDED WITH THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND UNPRECEDENTED UNEMPLOYMENT IN CLARK COUNTY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. MOST FENTANYL SEIZED IN CLARK COUNTY HAS BEEN IN ILLICITLY MANUFACTURED PRESSED PILLS, OFTEN OXY 30S (HIDTA).  THE HEAT MAP OF SUSPECTED FENTANYL OVERDOSES SHOW THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM IN A SINGLE ZIP CODE OR REGION, BUT ACROSS ALL BOUNDARIES, RACE, SOCIOECONOMIC, RURAL, URBAN, ETC.  UNFORTUNATELY, WITH THE INCREASE IN FENTANYL IN OUR DRUG SUPPLY, MOST OF THE OVERDOSES ARE OCCURRING IN YOUNGER PEOPLE, AND MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE FENTANYL  IN THEIR SYSTEM ARE NOT DESIROUS OF THE DRUG.  OFTEN FENTANYL IS NOT DISCOVERED UNTIL A BODY REACHES THE CORONER?S OFFICE.  CLARK COUNTY ALSO HAS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE WITH ILLICIT ADULT METH USE AND OTHER STIMULANT DRUGS.  AS OF 2018, NEVADA HAD THE HIGHEST RATES OF METH OVERDOSES IN THE COUNTRY (CDC). WHILE THE OPIOID CRISIS WAS SWEEPING THE NATION, OUR TREATMENT PROVIDERS ROUTINELY TOLD US THAT WHILE THEY WERE SEEING AN INCREASE IN OPIOID OVERDOSES, THEIR MAIN PROBLEM CONTINUED TO BE STIMULANTS, ESPECIALLY ADULT METH USE.  WHAT PACT HAS LEARNED FROM THE DFC GRANT IS THAT IT IS BEST TO START IN A SINGLE SCHOOL AND IN A SINGLE ZIP CODE TO ACHIEVE LASTING CHANGE.  PACT HAS ALSO FOUND THAT WHILE CERTAIN AREAS MAY HAVE HIGHER NEED, THOSE AREAS OFTEN ALREADY HAVE MULTIPLE RESOURCES AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE WILLING TO PARTNER.  FOR THIS REASON, PACT HAS CHOSEN TO PARTNER WITH CIMARRON MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL DUE TO ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS, PRINCIPAL BUY IN, ABILITY TO COLLABORATE ON YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY DATA AS WELL AS PROXIMITY TO DFC FUNDED PROGRAM AT SIG ROGICH MIDDLE SCHOOL WHICH IS A FEEDER SCHOOL TO CIMARRON.

HARRISONBURG IS THE LARGEST CITY IN VIRGINIA?S ROCKINGHAM COUNTY SEAT WITH THE MOST URBAN LOCALITY AND LOCATED IN THE BEAUTIFUL SHENANDOAH VALLEY. THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF FORENSIC SCIENCE?S 2018 REPORTS SHOWS THAT IN ROCKINGHAM COUNTY, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DRUG CASES FOR METHAMPHETAMINE IS STEADILY INCREASING, MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE.  METH IS THE MOST WIDELY USED ILLICIT DRUG - FROM 50 DRUG CASES IN 2010 TO OVER 225 DRUG CASES IN 2018.  IN THE CITY OF HARRISONBURG, WHILE MARIJUANA EXCEEDS OTHER DRUGS, METH IS NOW THE SECOND MOST WIDELY USED SUBSTANCE.  IN 2010, THERE WERE LESS THAN 10 METH CASES COMPARED TO THE ALMOST 140 CASES REPORTED IN 2018. HARRISONBURG IS HOME OF JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY (JMU), ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE AREA.

OREGON LEGALIZED MARIJUANA WITH MEASURE 91 IN 2014, CREATING A MORE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR THE COALITION. WE RESPONDED BY PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR LOCAL POLICYMAKERS, HOSTING SEVERAL TOWN HALL FORUMS, AND SPONSORED SEVERAL DRUG-FREE YOUTH ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTY-WIDE MESSAGING CAMPAIGN.  IN NOVEMBER 2020, VOTERS IN OREGON PASSED BALLOT MEASURE 110, WHICH RECLASSIFIES AND DECRIMINALIZES POSSESSION/PENALTIES FOR DRUGS, INCLUDING HEROIN, METHAMPHETAMINE, LSD, OXYCODONE, ETC. THE MEASURE POSES A PROFOUND CHALLENGE WITH FEWER CONSEQUENCES FOR THE POSSESSION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF THESE ILLICIT DRUGS FOR ADULTS AND MINORS. WE WON'T SEE THE FULL IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES FOR YEARS, BUT PREVENTION ACTIVITIES MUST BEGIN IMMEDIATELY. OUR 49-MEMBER COALITION BOASTS STRONG CONNECTIONS WITHIN EACH OF THE SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR COUNTY AND HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS. DURING THAT TIME, PREVIOUS MONTH ALCOHOL USE IN 11TH GRADERS WAS REDUCED A WHOPPING 22%, AND THERE HAS BEEN A 60% DROP IN 11TH-GRADE BINGE DRINKING (5 OR MORE DRINKS).  IN SUPPORT OF THESE EFFORTS, THE COALITION HAS HOSTED SEVERAL NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SPEAKERS AND TOWN HALL FORUMS, ALCOHOL AND DRUG AWARENESS ACTIVITIES AT SCHOOLS AND IN THE COMMUNITY, AND A 7TH-GRADE CONFERENCE WHERE ALL COUNTY 7TH GRADERS GATHER IN A CENTRALIZED LOCATION TO LEARN ABOUT THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.UCSCC ALSO HAS A STRONG YOUTH COUNCIL WITH 13 MEMBERS REPRESENTING DIFFERENT SCHOOLS WITHIN THE COUNTY.

EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO RECOGNIZE THIS THREAT AND DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO CREATE A SAFER, DRUG-FREE COMMUNITY FOR OUR YOUTH. DALLAS COUNTY HAS MORE SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY RISK FACTORS THAN THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDING COUNTIES. THESE RISK FACTORS INCLUDE: THE LOWEST MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME ($56,854); LOWEST HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE (78.7%); HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY (14.2%); HIGHEST NUMBER OF SINGLE-PARENT HOUSEHOLDS (39%); HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE (3.8%); HIGHEST NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES (480/100,000 PEOPLE); HIGHEST TEEN BIRTH RATE (42/1,000 FEMALES). THE DALLAS AREA DRUG PREVENTION PARTNERSHIP WILL TARGET SEVEN (7) OF THE MOST UNDERSERVED, DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHEAST DALLAS COUNTY WHERE OUR YOUTH ARE FACING AN ESPECIALLY HIGH LEVEL OF RISK. THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATES, LOWEST AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME, HIGHEST POVERTY RATES, HIGHEST NUMBER OF HEALTH DISPARITIES WITHIN DALLAS COUNTY, AND SOME OF THE HIGHEST  NUMBER OF DRUG-RELATED OFFENSES IN DALLAS ISD. THESE COMMUNITIES HAD OVER 5,000 COMBINED 911 CALLS FOR OVERDOSE RELATED INCIDENCES BETWEEN 2018 AND 2020. THE COMMUNITIES RACIAL DEMOGRAPHIC IS APPROXIMATELY 40% AFRICAN AMERICAN AND 32% HISPANIC, MAKING MINORITY, AT-RISK POPULATIONS ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 70% OF THE POPULATION.
