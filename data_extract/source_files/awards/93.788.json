HOWEVER, THE OVERUSE OF THESE DRUGS HAS LAUNCHED THE COUNTRY INTO A STATE OF ABUSE AND ADDICTION AS WELL AS AN OPIOID OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC. THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) IS A LOCATION COMMONLY ACCESSED FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT MAKING THIS AN IDEAL LOCATION TO IMPLEMENT APPROACHES TO REDUCE PAIN WITHOUT THE USE OF OPIATES. A 2018 ARTICLE IN THE ADVANCE JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE2 REPORTED 80% OF ADMISSIONS WERE DUE TO REPORTS OF PAIN. AS PAIN CAN BE AN INDICATOR OF A POTENTIAL MEDICAL ISSUE OR ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF A KNOWN MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS, EMERGENCY ATTENTION MAY BE IMPERATIVE. ASSESSING PAIN DIFFERS FOR EACH PERSON EVALUATED AS PAIN TOLERANCE IS UNIQUE AND NOT GENERALIZABLE.   THE ESKENAZI HEALTH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ALTERNATIVES TO OPIOIDS PROGRAM PLANS TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USING INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND NON-OPIOID ANALGESICS. THIS PATHWAY WILL ASSESS THE MEDICAL CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AND THE LEVEL OF PAIN. THESE METHODS WILL REPLACE THE USE OF OPIOIDS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT AMONG POPULATIONS THAT TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE PAIN FROM THEIR MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND PREVENT EXPOSURE TO OPIATES. THIS DETERRENCE WOULD THEN DIVERT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPIOID MISUSE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY ESCALATE TO AN OPIOID USE DISORDER (OUD) AND PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF PAIN MANAGEMENT FOR THOSE WHO ALREADY STRUGGLE WITH OUD. ELIGIBLE MEDICAL CONDITIONS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO SICKLE CELL DISEASE, GALLSTONES, KIDNEY DISEASE, HEADACHES, FRACTURES, SPRAINS, STRAINS, AND OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS, AS APPROPRIATE.  STAFF TRAINED IN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS WILL CONSULT THE PATHWAY AND DETERMINE THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY MEDICAL STAFF APPROVED TO APPLY THIS METHOD OF TREATMENT, AND A PHARMACY SPECIALIST WILL CONSULT AND PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION. MIND-BODY MEDICINE WILL FACILITATE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS GUIDED IMAGERY, MUSIC THERAPY, BREATHING EXERCISES, AND OTHER METHODS THAT CAN ALSO BE REPLICATED OUTSIDE OF THE ED. IN THE CASE OF CHRONIC PAIN, PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE REFERRALS TO THE ESKENAZI HEALTH PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINIC WHERE THEY WILL RECEIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT EDUCATION, THERAPY, AND TREATMENT. THROUGH THESE INTERVENTIONS, THE ESKENAZI HEALTH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ALTERNATIVES TO OPIOIDS PROGRAM PLANS TO SERVE 3,600 UNDUPLICATED CLIENTS FOR THE DURATION OF THE THREE-YEAR GRANT PERIOD.

OUR MULTI-MODAL APPROACH WILL REDUCE OPIOID EXPOSURE AMONGST PATIENTS WHO ARE IN PAIN, AT-RISK FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER, OR ALREADY SUFFERING FROM OPIOID USE DISORDER.  OPIOID OVERDOSE DEATHS REMAIN DISPROPORTIONALLY HIGH IN OHIO, ESPECIALLY AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES, AS DOES MORBIDITY FROM SUBSTANCE USE (E.G., INFECTIOUS DISEASE, MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS).  YET, EFFORTS TO REDUCE OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE EPIDEMIC OF UNDERTREATED PAIN.  THERE IS AN URGENT AND IMPERATIVE NEED TO REDUCE OPIOID USE FOR PATIENTS AT RISK OF OPIOID USE DISORDER (OUD) AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED ALTERNATIVES TO OPIOIDS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED).    A KEY ADVANTAGE OF OUR TWO LARGE VOLUME EDS AND THEIR BROAD CATCHMENT AREA IS THE CAPACITY TO ACCESS DIVERSE AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.  WE ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING IMMIGRANTS, PREGNANT WOMEN, HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS, RACIAL AND GENDER MINORITIES, AND BOTH RURAL APPALACHIAN AND URBAN POPULATIONS SUFFERING FROM EXTREME POVERTY.

OUR INNOVATIVE APPROACH ADAPTS THE SBIRT FRAMEWORK IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION FOR BOTH PAIN AND DISORDERED OPIOID USE.  WE WILL DO THIS BY: (I) MULTI-MODAL, PERSON-CENTERED APPROACHES TO CHANGING PRACTICE AMONG EXISTING ED STAFF AND (II) CO-LOCATING PARALLEL SUPPORT STAFF FROM OUR HEALTHNOW PROGRAM (I.E. SCREENING, CONSULT SERVICE, AND POST-ED PATIENT ASSESSMENT/SUPPORT).  SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES RELATED TO PAIN AND OPIOID USE DISORDERS BY: (I) DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY ED PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PAIN OR HISTORY OF NON-MEDICAL OPIOID USE, (II) EXPANDING NON-OPIOID PAIN TREATMENTS, PAIN EDUCATION, AND NON-MEDICAL COPING ADJUNCTS FOR PAIN, AND (III) IMPROVING DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND REFERRAL FOR PAIN AND OUD.

TO THIS END, ALERT WILL IMPLEMENT COMPUTERIZED, OPIOID-SPARING ORDER SETS FOR PATIENTS PRESENTING MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, DENTAL PAIN, HEADACHE, KIDNEY STONES, AND ABDOMINAL PAIN. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE PAIN IS A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL PHENOMENON, THE MOST COMPLEX PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE A MULTIDISCIPLINARY ASSESSMENT, A COMPREHENSIVE CARE PLAN, AND NAVIGATION SERVICES TO HELP THEM ACCESS HOSPITAL- AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES, INCLUDING MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE, ADDICTION TREATMENT, RESTORATIVE THERAPIES, COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES, AND SERVICES TO ADDRESS UNMET BASIC NEEDS. THE POPULATION OF FOCUS IS MEN AND WOMEN (AGE 18 AND OLDER) WHO FREQUENTLY SEEK PAIN CARE IN THE THREE EDS OPERATED BY BERKSHIRE HEALTH SYSTEMS (BHS). IN CY2022, 16,185 UNDUPLICATED PAIN PATIENTS WERE SEEN IN THE BHS EDS, 13.8% OF WHOM IDENTIFIED AS RACIAL MINORITIES AND 4.5% AS HISPANIC/LATINO. THE GEOGRAPHIC CATCHMENT AREA IS BERKSHIRE COUNTY. ALTHOUGH THE POPULATION IDENTIFIES PREDOMINANTLY AS WHITE (86.2%), THE COUNTY IS INCREASINGLY DIVERSE, WITH A 54% INCREASE IN THE HISPANIC/LATINO POPULATION IN THE PAST 10 YEARS. A CENTER OF ARTS, CULTURE AND RECREATION, BERKSHIRE COUNTY IS A POPULAR RETIREMENT DESTINATION AND TOURIST AREA. THE COUNTY\u2019S MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME ($63,169) IS LOWER THAN THE STATE ($89,026) AND THE US ($70,784).

ACROSS THE NEW ENGLAND (NE) REGION, OVERDOSE DEATHS ARE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE NATION, RANGING FROM 30.3 TO 39.7 DEATHS PER 100,000 POPULATION IN ALL SIX NE STATES.  ADDITIONALLY, WHILE PRESCRIPTION OPIOID MISUSE IS STILL PREVALENT, MOST OVERDOSE DEATHS IN NE INVOLVE ILLICITLY MANUFACTURED FENTANYL, WHICH IS NOW UBIQUITOUSLY FOUND IN UNREGULATED SUBSTANCES INCLUDING COCAINE, HEROIN, COUNTERFEIT PILLS, CRACK COCAINE, AND METHAMPHETAMINE. PEOPLE WHO USE UNREGULATED SUBSTANCES RECREATIONALLY, PARTICULARLY STIMULANTS, ARE FREQUENTLY UNAWARE THAT THE HIGHLY POTENT OPIOID FENTANYL, OR ONE OF ITS ANALOGUES, COULD BE LACED IN THE SUBSTANCE THEY ARE INGESTING. RURAL COMMUNITIES IN NE ARE SEEING SOME OF THE LARGEST INCREASES IN OVERDOSE DEATHS SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. THERE ARE FOUR POTENTIAL KEY FACTORS TO INCREASED OPIOID MISUSE IN RURAL AREAS: 1. INCREASED SALES OF OPIOIDS, WHICH LEADS TO GREATER AVAILABILITY, 2. OUT-MIGRATION OF YOUNG ADULTS FROM RURAL AREAS WHICH LEAVES AN AGGREGATION OF YOUNG ADULTS AT HIGH RISK FOR DRUG USE, 3. SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT ALLOW FASTER DIFFUSION OF OPIOIDS, 4. INCREASING ECONOMIC DEPRIVATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT (KEYS ET ALL 2014). LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, AS MOST OF NE LACKS A ROBUST SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS RURAL AREAS IN EACH STATE, WHICH LIMITS AN INDIVIDUAL'S ACCESS TO SUPPORT SERVICES FOR OPIOID MISUSE. IN ADDITION TO GEOGRAPHIC CONSIDERATIONS, STIGMA REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO INDIVIDUALS SEEKING SUPPORT FOR OPIOID MISUSE, WHICH CAN CONTRIBUTE TO POOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, NON-COMPLETION OF TREATMENT PROGRAMS, DELAYED RECOVERY, AND INCREASED INVOLVEMENT IN RISKY BEHAVIORS (LIVINGSTON ET AL 2011). TO ADDRESS THE GROWING OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC IN RHODE ISLAND, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES, THE UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND, THROUGH ITS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM AND ACADEMIC HEALTH COLLABORATIVE, ESTABLISHED THE COMMUNITY FIRST RESPONDER PROGRAM (CFRP) IN OCTOBER 2019. THE GOALS OF THE CFRP ARE TO: 1. EDUCATE RURAL COMMUNITIES ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND OPIOID MISUSE, AND 2. PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THESE COMMUNITIES TO HELP ADDRESS OPIOID MISUSE.  TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE GROWING OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC IN THE REGION, THE CFRP NOW SEEKS TO EXPAND ITS SERVICES TO RURAL REGIONS IN THE OTHER FIVE NE STATES.
