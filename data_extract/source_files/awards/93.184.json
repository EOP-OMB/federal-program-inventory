OF UTAH\u2019S TOTAL POPULATION OF ADULTS, MORE THAN HALF A MILLION HAVE A DISABILITY (22.3%, BRFSS). DESPITE PROGRESS IN THE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ARE SEEN BETWEEN THEM AND THOSE WITHOUT DISABILITIES. THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN RISKY HEALTH BEHAVIORS, HAVE POOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, AND HAVE REDUCED ACCESS TO OR USE PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE AND HEALTH PROMOTION SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN A STATE KNOWN FOR ITS LOW SMOKING RATES, 17.6% OF UTAH ADULTS WITH A DISABILITY SMOKE COMPARED TO ONLY 6.9% OF ADULTS WITHOUT A DISABILITY. THE UDOH DHP UNDERSTANDS THAT THE REASONS FOR THESE HEALTH DIFFERENCES ARE VARIED, INCLUDING BIOLOGICAL, BUT THAT MUCH OF THE DIFFERENCES WE SEE ARE AVOIDABLE AND SOCIETALLY BASED. DHP RECOGNIZES THAT DISPROPORTIONATE SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGES, SUCH AS FOOD SECURITY, INCOME, AND EDUCATION, FACED BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE HEALTHY LIVES OR ACCESS NEEDED SERVICES. POLICIES, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENTS (PSE) CAN DISABLE OR ENABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES.

THE EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OUTLINED WILL DEMONSTRATE INCREASES IN HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES AND REDUCTIONS IN HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE POPULATIONS SERVED BY THE PROGRAM.

THE INTERMEDIATE OUTCOM ES ARE AS FOLLOWS: BY JUNE 30, 2026; 1) THE DHP WILL HAVE STRENGTHENED ENGAGEMENT AND COORDINATION WITH OTHER RECIPIENTS AND KEY PARTNERS, AS WELL AS A BROADER REACH AMONG THE TARGET POPULATIONS; 2) THE DHP WILL HAVE INCREASED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT STATE AND JURISDICTIONAL NEEDS; CREATING A REPOSITORY OF RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AND INCREASE THE USE OF THOSE RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF ADULTS WITH IDD AND ADULTS WITH ML, 3) THE DHP WILL FACILITATE INCREASED AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND COMPETENCY OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO DELIVER ACCESSIBLE PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE TO ADULTS WITH IDD AND ADULTS WITH ML, 4) THE DHP WILL FACILITATE INCREASED KNOWLEDGE AND APPROPRIATE LINKAGE OF CARE TO ADULTS WITH IDD WITH RECOMMENDED PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS. SPECIFICALLY, WAYS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE; LINKAGES TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE; AND HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES, 5)THE DHP WILL FACILITATE INCREASED ENROLLMENT OF ADULTS WITH IDD AND ADULTS WITH ML IN EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH PROMOTION INTERVENTIONS.
