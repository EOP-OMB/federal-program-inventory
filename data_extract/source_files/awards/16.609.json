(NOTE: BECAUSE EDVA COVERS MANY MORE JURISDICTIONS BEYOND THESE FOUR CITIES, THIS FIGURE IS A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE, NOT AN INCLUSIVE NUMBER.) OF THOSE MAJOR CRIMES, 3,663 WERE VIOLENT, CONSISTING OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING OFFENSES: MURDER, ROBBERY, RAPE AND OTHER FORCIBLE SEX OFFENSES, AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS.

THE MAJORITY OF THE DISTRICT\u2019S COMMUNITY VIOLENCE STEMS FROM DRUG TRAFFICKING AND GANG ACTIVITY AND IN PARTICULAR DISPUTES BETWEEN RIVAL CREWS OR GANGS.
