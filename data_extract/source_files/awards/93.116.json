LTBI PREVALENCE DATA ARE CRITICAL TO TRACKING THE UNITED STATES' PROGRESS IN TESTING AND TREATING PERSONS WITH LATENT TB INFECTION. MORE THAN 80% OF TB CASES IN THE US RESULT FROM LONG-STANDING, UNTREATED LATENT TB INFECTION. TB IS A NATIONALLY NOTIFIABLE DISEASE; HOWEVER, LTBI IS NOT REPORTED TO THE CDC SO WE ARE UNABLE TO ASSESS THE PRESENCE OF HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG THE 13 MILLION PEOPLE ESTIMATED TO HAVE LTBI IN THE US.
