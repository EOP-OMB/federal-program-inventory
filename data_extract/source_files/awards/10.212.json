REPEATED OUTBREAKS AND RAPID SPREAD OF GENETICALLY AND ANTIGENICALLY DISTINCT IAVS REPRESENT A CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE FOR EFFECTIVE SWINE IAV CONTROL. THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SWINE IAV VACCINES ARE 1) THE CHALLENGE OF UPDATING VACCINES FASTER THAN THE RATE OF VIRAL EVOLUTION, 2) THE TIME NEEDED FOR APPROVAL AND LICENSING OF UPDATED VACCINES, 3) MATERNAL ANTIBODY INTERFERENCE, AND 4) THE LACK OF AN ADEQUATE MUCOSAL AND CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSE.

COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL PROTEINS, CRICKET PROTEIN RETAILS FOR OVER TWICE THE COST. THIS IS EVEN AFTER FACTORING OUT WATER WEIGHT (CRICKETS ARE GENERALLY SOLD DRY ROASTED OR POWDERED). THE TWO BIGGEST FACTORS DRIVING UP THE COST INCLUDE LACK OF INNOVATION AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE. UNLIKE THE BEEF, PORK, POULTRY, AND SOY INDUSTRIES, THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE INNOVATION INVESTED INTO FARMING CRICKETS. MOST OF THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION OCCURS IN THAILAND, WHERE GOODS ARE GENERALLY PRODUCED VIA MANUAL LABOR VERSUS AUTOMATION. IN ADDITION TO LABOR COSTS, ELECTRICITY AND FEED COMPRISE THE NEXT TWO BIGGEST COSTS IN CRICKET FARMING. UTILIZING SOLAR ENERGY AND INSULATION HELPS ADDRESS ELECTRICAL COSTS, MEANWHILE THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS FEED COSTS. AS INNOVATIONS REDUCE THE COST OF CRICKET PRODUCTION, IT OPENS THE DOOR TO MORE BUYERS, IN TURN IMPROVING ECONOMIES OF SCALE.THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL ALSO ADDRESSES THE NEED TO RECAPTURE FOOD WASTE IN THE US, DIVERTING A PORTION OF FOOD WASTE FROM LANDFILLS. THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE IS SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDING TO THE USDA, IN THE UNITED STATES, FOOD WASTE IS ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN 30-40 PERCENT OF THE FOOD SUPPLY. THIS ESTIMATE, BASED ON ESTIMATES FROM USDA&#39;S ECONOMIC RESEARCH SERVICE OF 31 PERCENT FOOD LOSS AT THE RETAIL AND CONSUMER LEVELS, CORRESPONDED TO APPROXIMATELY 133 BILLION POUNDS AND $161 BILLION WORTH OF FOOD IN 2010. FOOD IS THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF MUNICIPAL LANDFILL WASTE, ACCOUNTING FOR AN AVERAGE OF 22%. ALL OF THIS FOOD WASTE CREATES A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR MIGHTY CRICKET TO PROCURE CRICKET FEED AT LOWER COST THAN WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET. MIGHTY CRICKET WILL THEN BE ABLE TO PASS ALONG THE COST SAVINGS TO BUYERS OF CRICKET PROTEIN. THESE INCLUDE CONSUMERS PURCHASING MIGHTY CRICKET PRODUCTS AT RETAIL OUTLETS ALONG WITH MANUFACTURERS OF PET FOOD, PHARMACEUTICALS, AND BIOPLASTICS.IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, GLOBAL DEMAND FOR ALTERNATIVE PROTEINS HAS SPIKED. IT IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE (CAGR) OF 18% THROUGH 2032, REACHING $497.6 BILLION USD. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND IS DRIVEN BY PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD SOURCES. CONVENTIONAL PROTEIN PRODUCTION POSES A SUBSTANTIAL STRAIN ON THE ECOSYSTEM, REQUIRING UNSUSTAINABLE QUANTITIES OF WATER, LAND, AND FEED AS INPUTS. FURTHERMORE, ANIMAL BASED PROTEINS ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, ESTIMATED AT 14.5% OF ALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. TODAY&#39;S FOOD SYSTEM CAN ONLY FEED 3.4 BILLION PEOPLE SUSTAINABLY. TO SUSTAIN THE WORLD&#39;S GROWING POPULATION, FOOD PRODUCTION PRACTICES NEED TO DRAMATICALLY SHIFT TOWARDS RESOURCE CONSERVATION, AND CONSUMERS ARE DEMANDING CHANGE.CRICKET FARMING POSES ONE SOLUTION TO THE CHALLENGE OF FOOD PRODUCTION, AS IT REQUIRES A FRACTION OF CONSUMABLE INPUTS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL PROTEINS. THIS IS,WHY THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZES EDIBLE INSECTS AS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO PRODUCING FOOD AND FEED SECURITY.MIGHTY CRICKET WILL COLLECT DATA ON HOW THE CRICKET FEED PRODUCED FROM WASTE PERFORMS COMPARESTO STANDARD FEED ON THE MARKET.

THE USE OF RE-CIRCULATORY DIRECT-EXPANSION (DX) HEAT PUMP (HP) DRYING SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE A STATE-OF-THE-ART ENERGY EFFICIENT DRYING TECHNOLOGY.

THE EXTANT WINTER GREENHOUSES PERFORM POORLY IN THE FREQUENT HIGH WIND, HAILSTORMS AND COLD WINTERS. SOUTH DAKOTA (SD) FARMERS ARE RESTRICTED TO FEW CROP CHOICES SUCH AS CORN, SOYBEAN, AND WHEAT AND A SHORT 6-7-MONTH CROP GROWING PERIOD. SD FARMERS NEED DIVERSIFICATION TO PREVENT ECONOMIC COLLAPSE IN AN UNFORESEEN EVENT OF CROP FAILURE. SD HAS SEEN EXTENSIVE INVESTMENT IN HIGH TUNNELS. BETWEEN 2000-2018, THE USDA-NRCS HAS COST-SHARED AT LEAST 100 GREENHOUSES IN SD. THESE ONLY OPERATE BETWEEN MARCH-OCTOBER AND HAVE A HIGH DEPENDENCY ON FOSSIL FUEL HEATING. THEREFORE, MOST PRODUCE IS TRANSPORTED ALL YEAR ROUND FROM OTHER STATES TO MEET THE LOCAL DEMAND. HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND LENGTHY FOOD MILES TRANSLATE TO EXPENSIVE AND/OR REDUCED-QUALITY PRODUCE, ESPECIALLY IN THE REMOTE AND RURAL AREAS OF SD. PRODUCE REQUIRING WARM WEATHER OR HAVE SHORT SHELF LIFE (E.G., RASPBERRIES, FRENCH BEANS, OKRA) IS NOT COMMONLY SEEN IN THE MARKETS AND IS IN HIGH DEMAND. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO INNOVATE GREENHOUSE STRUCTURES FOR SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND DURABILITY FOR NORTHERN LOCATIONS WITH EXTREME AND UNPREDICTABLE WEATHER.TRADITIONAL GREENHOUSES RELY ON FOSSIL FUELS FOR HEATING AND COOLING WHICH MAY SOON BECOME COST PROHIBITIVE TO MANY. IN CONTRAST, SOLAR GREENHOUSES USE FREE SOLAR ENERGY FOR HEATING. HOWEVER, CURRENT WINTER SOLAR GREENHOUSES ARE STILL RELIANT ON ANCILLARY FOSSIL FUEL HEATING AND ARE NOT DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND FREQUENT HIGH WINDS OR HAILSTORMS. FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE EFFICIENCY, SOLAR GREENHOUSES HAVE TO BE TAILOR-MADE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE LATITUDE/LONGITUDE, METEOROLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LOCATION. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO SUCH DESIGN FOR AN ENERGY-EFFICIENT, WIND AND HAIL-RESISTANT SOLAR GREENHOUSE IS AVAILABLE FOR SD. ENERGY-EFFICIENT, AFFORDABLE, AND LONG-LASTING HEATING SYSTEM IS ONE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN CONSTRUCTING AN EXTREME WINTER GREENHOUSE. RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES SUCH AS THE SOLAR, GEOTHERMAL HEAT AND BIOMASS ENERGY ALTERNATIVES TO FOSSIL FUELS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED AS HEAT SYSTEMS FOR WINTER GREENHOUSES. EXPENSIVE AND LABORIOUS DEEP EXCAVATION IS REQUIRED TO HARNESS GEOTHERMAL ENERGY OR USE THE SOLAR-AIR HEAT SYSTEMS. THESE CAN DRIVE UP THE COST SIGNIFICANTLY. THEREFORE, WE HAVE FOCUSED ON SOLAR ENERGY AND ABOVE GROUND SOLAR-WATER HEAT TRANSFER AND STORAGE TO KEEP THE GREENHOUSE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE COST LOW.WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE APPLICABILITY OF A COMPOUND PARABOLIC CONCENTRATOR AND OIL HEAT TRANSFER FLUID SYSTEM TO CONVERT SOLAR ENERGY TO THERMAL ENERGY. A HEAT EXCHANGER SYSTEM LOCATED INSIDE THE HIGHLY INSULATED GREENHOUSE WILL TRANSFER THE THERMAL ENERGY TO WATER WHICH WILL BE CIRCULATED THROUGH THE WATER LINES PLACED IN A ROCK BED. THE CIRCULATING WARM WATER WILL SUFFICIENTLY RAISE THE SOIL TEMPERATURE (NIGHTTIME TEMPERATURE&GT;50 OF; DAYTIME TEMPERATURE &GT;75 OF) TO PERMIT CULTIVATION OF WARM,WEATHER CROPS ALL YEAR AROUND. AT ATAL (AVERAGE TILT AT LATITUDE) OF RC, SOLAR PANELS CAN RECEIVE UP TO 5.27 KWH/M2 /DAY WHICH IS COMPARABLE WITH SOME OF THE LOCATIONS IN CHINA THAT HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT SUCCESS IN OFF-SEASON CROP CULTIVATION WITH THE CHINESE SOLAR GREENHOUSES (CSGS). THE CSGS OPERATE ALL YEAR ROUND IN THE COLDEST LOCATIONS OF CHINA WITHOUT REQUIRING SUPPLEMENTAL HEATING AND HAVE SUCCESSFULLY AUGMENTED THE CHINESE FARMERS INCOME. A TOTAL OF 3.7MILLION HM2 WERE OCCUPIED WITH HORTICULTURE BY THE END OF 2017. WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THE ERGO GREENHOUSE DESIGN WILL PERFORM AS WELL AS THE CSGS OR EVEN BETTER IN EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, ERGO WILL HAVE ADEQUATE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY TO PROVIDE HIGH WIND AND HAIL-RESILIENCE.TECHNO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW RATE OF RETURN (DCFROR) MODEL WILL ESTIMATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY. REAL-TIME DATA FROM THE LABORATORY SCALE PROTOTYPE WILL IDENTIFY THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESS, CRUCIAL TO PROGRESS TO MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF THE ERGO PRODUCT IN PHASE II. THIS IS PARTICULARLY APPLICABLE TO RC, WHICH EXPERIENCES FREQUENTLY CHANGING WEATHER WHICH WOULD RENDER DATA FROM COMPUTER SIMULATION INADEQUATE AND UNRELIABLE. THE DURABILITY AND PERFORMANCE EFFICIENCY OF ERGO WILL BE TESTED OVER THE 6-MONTH PERIOD DURING WHICH WE EXPECT HAILSTORMS, HIGH WINDS AND EXTREME COLD. ACTIVE SOLAR GREENHOUSES ARE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY FEW COMPANIES IN USA MANUFACTURING THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS: POLYCARBONATE AND SOLAR HARDWARE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE DURABLE AND ENERGY EFFICIENT ERGO PRODUCT WILL GENERATE AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR WINTER SOLAR GREENHOUSES WHICH WILL IN TURN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SPUR MORE INVESTMENT IN LOCAL MANUFACTURING OF GH BUILDING MATERIALS AND SOLAR HARDWARE.PARALLEL TO THE SOCIAL BENEFITS OFFERED BY A COMMUNITY GARDEN, ERGO ALSO WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BRING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER WITH A COMMON GOAL OF IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY AND EATING HEALTHY.

THE COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN USED IN A RANGE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS OWING TO THESE ROBUST PROPERTIES. THEIR UNUSUAL STABILITY AND THUS LONG HALF-LIFE HAVE LED TO THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE COMPOUNDS IN THE ENVIRONMENT. IT IS NOW WELL ESTABLISHED THAT INGESTION OF THESE CHEMICALS CAN LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RANGE OF HEALTH DISORDERS FROM ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION TO CANCER. REGULATIONS AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL ARE SETTING HEALTH ADVISORIES OF MAXIMUM ACCEPTABLE CONCENTRATION LEVELS. UNFORTUNATELY, CONVENTIONAL WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS CANNOT REMOVE PFAS. THE RECALCITRANT NATURE OF THESE COMPOUNDS, OWING TO THE STRENGTH AND SHIELDING EFFECTS OF THE CARBON-FLUORINE BONDS, MAKES DESTRUCTIVE REMOVAL DIFFICULT. MEMBRANE TREATMENTS AND ACTIVATED CARBON ARE CAPABLE OF REMOVING PFAS EFFECTIVELY, BUT EACH CREATES A CONCENTRATED WASTE STREAM. THEUS EPA IDENTIFIES A RESEARCH GAP FOR LOW-COST METHODS TO PROCESS CONCENTRATE STREAMS FROM MEMBRANE PROCESSES OR CHEAPER METHODS TO REGENERATE ACTIVATED CARBON. THE EFFORT PROPOSED HERE AIMS TO USE PLASMA TO DESTROY PFAS COMPOUNDS, BOTH IN CONTAMINATED WATER SYSTEMS AND IN CONCENTRATE STREAMS, DERIVED FROM MEMBRANE PROCESSES. WHILE IT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED THAT PLASMAS ARE EFFECTIVE AT DESTROYING PFAS, THE CONSENSUS IS THAT WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ON SCALING UP THE PROCESS AND QUANTIFYING OVERALL IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL COSTS. TO DATE, PLASMA REACTORS--EVEN THE LARGE ONES--HAVE BEEN PREDOMINANTLY BATCH-MODE REACTORS. IT IS DESIRABLE IN INDUSTRIAL OR MUNICIPAL APPLICATIONS TO TREAT WATER IN A FLOW REACTOR CONFIGURATION. OUR GOAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A ONCE-THROUGH, SCALABLE FLOW PLASMA REACTOR CAPABLE OF TREATING PRACTICAL INFLUENT FLOWS. PFAS REMOVAL VIA PLASMA TREATMENT IS PREDOMINANTLY A SURFACE TREATMENT PROCESS--ESSENTIALLY LONG CHAIN HYDROPHOBIC PFAS COMPOUNDS ARE DEGRADED BY ENERGETIC ELECTRONS, IONS, AND UV LIGHT EXPOSURE. CONSIDERABLE DESTRUCTION IS INITIATED VIA REDUCTION BY SOLVATED ELECTRONS DERIVED FROM THE PLASMA WHERE ELECTRON ADDITION LEADS TO SPONTANEOUS BOND CLEAVAGE AND DEFLUORINATION. TO DESTROY THE PFAS WITH PLASMA, MULTIPLE EXPOSURES OF THE LIQUID SURFACE ARE REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE CONTAMINANTS TO SMALLER CHAINS AND ULTIMATELY TO CAUSE MINERALIZATION. IN THIS REGARD, ONE MUST CIRCULATE THE VOLUME OF WATER TO BE TREATED PAST THE PLASMA MULTIPLE TIMES AS IN A BATCH REACTOR. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO CONVERT FROM BATCH-MODE EXPLORED IN PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS TO A FLOW REACTOR GEOMETRY WHILE PRESERVING BATCH MODE KINETICS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT USING A SERIES OF REACTORS WITH RECIRCULATION SUCH THAT WATER EXPOSURE TO PLASMA MATCHES THE CONTACT TIME IN OUR BATCH REACTOR, WE CAN ACHIEVE SIMILAR DEGRADATION IN A FLOW-THROUGH GEOMETRY. REMOVAL IS ACHIEVED THROUGH SERIAL PROCESSING OF THE WATER AS IT PASSES FROM ONE MICROREACTOR TO THE NEXT SO,THAT THE WATER RECEIVES THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF PASSES THROUGH THE PLASMA OVER THE CHARACTERISTIC TIME CONSTANT AS REALIZED IN A BATCH REACTOR. FURTHERMORE, WE WILL USE REVERSE OSMOSIS CONCENTRATE AS OUR INPUT FEEDWATER. THIS PFAS LOAD IS DEGRADED TO DESIRED LEVELS AT THE END OF THE FINAL MICROREACTOR WHERE THAT WATER IS BLENDED WITH RO PERMEATE TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED MCL, THUS REALIZING A TRUE FLOW-THROUGH REACTOR. THE SCALABILITY OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BE EXPLORED THROUGH THE ADDITION OF PARALLEL LEGS OF MICROREACTORS. IN ALL CASES, THE KINETICS THROUGH A GIVEN FLOW REACTOR WILL MATCH THE EXPOSURE REALIZED IN THE BATCH REACTOR FROM PREVIOUS WORK.

THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) HAS PROPOSED TO DESIGNATE PFAS COMPOUNDS AS HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION, AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA) WHICH WILL POTENTIALLY CLASSIFY HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS, OF SITES WITHIN THE US AS NEW CLEAN-UP SITES. CURRENT ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT UP TO 57,000 SITES IN THE US ARE CONTAMINATED WITH PFAS AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE FREQUENCY OF DISCOVERING ON-FARM CONTAMINATION OF FOOD-ANIMALS WILL INCREASE AS TESTING BECOMES MORE COMMON.

THIS STUDY WILL ALSO INFORM US HOW MUCH FLUOR MOP MATERIAL IS NEEDED TO KEEP PFAS FROM ACCUMULATING IN THE BROILERS. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE SCALED TO OTHER ANIMALS AND PROVIDES EVIDENCE FLUOR MOP CAN PREVENT PFAS CONTAMINATION.TO ACCESS THE ABILITY OF FLUOR MOP TO REDUCE PFAS LEVELS IN ALREADY CONTAMINATED ANIMALS, LAYING HENS WILL BE USED SINCE THEY HAVE A LONGER PRODUCTION CYCLE AND THE EGGS CAN BE TESTED AS WELL SINCE IT IS KNOWN PFAS CAN PASS FROM THE HENS TO THE EGGS. HENS WILL BE EXPOSED FOR TWO WEEKS TO CONTAMINATED WATER AND THEN GIVEN CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND EGGS WILL CONTINUALLY BE COLLECTED AN,D FROZEN UNTIL TESTING. AFTER TWO WEEKS OF CONTAMINATED WATER, CLEAN DRINKING WATER WILL BE PROVIDED AND FOOD WITH FLUOR MOP ADDED WILL BE GIVEN TO THE LAYING HENS FOR 28 DAYS AT WHICH POINT THE STUDY WILL CONCLUDE. LAYING HENS WILL BE EUTHANIZED AND THEIR LIVER, PLASMA, MUSCLE TISSUE AND PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED EGGS WILL BE TESTED FOR THE SAME 11 DIFFERENT PFAS AS IN THE FIRST STUDY. THIS WILL DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF FLUOR MOP TO REDUCE PFAS LEVELS IN AN ALREADY CONTAMINATED ANIMAL.

COMPLETION OF THESE STUDIES WILL PROVIDE PROOF THAT FLUOR MOP MATERIAL CAN BE USED TO PREVENT AND/OR TREAT PFAS IN CHICKENS/LAYING HENS. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR LARGER STUDIES ON OTHER LIVESTOCK LIKE DAIRY AND BEEF COWS, GOATS, AND PIGS. GOOD PERFORMANCE OF FLUOR MOP WITH OTHER ANIMALS WOULD MEAN IT IS THE FIRST TREATMENT/PREVENTION METHOD FOR PFAS CONTAMINATION IN LIVESTOCK.

BIOFUEL PRODUCTION HAS BEEN LIMITED BY LOW PRODUCT YIELD, PRODUCTIVITY, AND TITER; WHEREAS BIOREFINERY USING LIGNOCELLULOSIC FEEDSTOCKS SUFFERS FROM HIGH CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRETREATMENTS AND CELLULOSE HYDROLYSIS, WHICH ALSO GENERATE INHIBITORS NEGATIVELY AFFECTING FERMENTATION PERFORMANCE. WE HAVE ENGINEERED A CLOSTRIDIA STRAIN AS A SUPERIOR CELL FACTORY THAT NOT ONLY CAN PRODUCE N-BUTANOL FROM BOTH GLUCOSE AND XYLOSE SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH HIGH YIELD AND PRODUCTIVITY, BUT ALSO HAS A HIGH TOLERANCETO HYDROLYSATE INHIBITORS AND CAN USE BIOMASS HYDROLYSATES DIRECTLY WITHOUT DETOXIFICATION. THIS NOVEL CELL FACTORY IS ROBUST FOR BUTANOL PRODUCTION BUT HAS NOT BEEN USED IN INDUSTRIAL FERMENTATION. IN ADDITION, A NOVEL MIXOTROPHIC FERMENTATION WITH ACETOGEN TO REASSIMILATE FORMATE DERIVED FROM CO2 RELEASED FROM SUGARS WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED TO FURTHER INCREASE BUTANOL PRODUCTION. PHASE I STUDIES WILL ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED BIOPROCESS INVOLVING TWO KEY FERMENTATION STEPS: 1) MIXOTROPHIC FERMENTATION FOR CONVERTING GLUCOSE AND FORMATE TO ACETATE WITH THE CO-CULTURES OF A HOMOLACTIC ACID BACTERIUM AND ACETOGEN, AND 2) BUTANOL PRODUCTION FROM GLUCOSE, XYLOSE, AND ACETATE BY ENGINEERED CLOSTRIDIA IMMOBILIZED IN LIBR WITH IN-SITU GAS STRIPPING.

IN AN INTRIGUING INTERPLAY BETWEEN PLANTS AND PATHOGENS, THESE SMALL RNAS ARE TAKEN UP BY FUNGI. TOGETHER WITH THE PROTEIN COMPLEX RISC, THEY SELECTIVELY BIND TO SPECIFIC MESSENGER RNAS (MRNAS) WITHIN THE FUNGI, EFFECTIVELY SILENCING THEM AND HINDERING THE PRODUCTION OF CRITICAL PROTEINS. SILVEC&#39;S RESEARCH HAS YIELDED REMARKABLE SUCCESS, DEMONSTRATING A REDUCTION IN VIRAL LEVELS EXCEEDING 3,000-FOLD BY UTILIZING OUR ENGINEERED IRNA VECTOR TO INOCULATE PLANTS AGAINST HIGHLY PATHOGENIC VIRUSES.

HOWEVER, MANAGED HONEY BEE POPULATIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN IN DECLINE FOR DECADES, POTENTIALLY ENDANGERING NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY AND NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS. THE HONEY BEE RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENT REGULATORY BODIES HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR KEY FACTORS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT HONEY BEE HEALTH AND ARE THOUGHT TO BE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR HONEY BEE POPULATION DECLINES: POOR NUTRITION, EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS, PATHOGENS, AND PARASITES (THE FOUR P&#39;S). IT IS LIKELY THAT ALL THESE FACTORS INDEPENDENTLY AND SYNERGISTICALLY CONVERGE ON BROOD PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE COLONY. HOWEVER, THE OPAQUE HIVE BODIES USED IN CLASSIC BEEKEEPING, TOGETHER WITH THE SCALE OF HONEY BEE COLONIES (I.E., TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BEES), MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASSAY THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE FOUR P&#39;S, QUEEN HEALTH AND THE EARLIEST AND MOST SENSITIVE LIFE STAGES OF THE BEE. HONEY BEES ARE ALSO USED AS A MODEL SYSTEM FOR ECOTOXICOLOGY RESEARCH ON INSECT POLLINATORS, BUT TRADITIONAL APICULTURE IS SEASONAL, EXPENSIVE (FULL FIELD STUDIES COST SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS), SCALES POORLY AND IS ILL-SUITED FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEED TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND APPROACHES TO EFFECTIVELY ASSESS THESE CRITICAL ASPECTS OF HONEY BEE HEALTH AND IMPROVE THEIR SCALABILITY, WITH MAJOR RAMIFICATIONS FOR MANAGED HONEY BEE POPULATIONS AND THE PLANTS (CROP OR OTHERWISE) THAT THEY POLLINATE.THE QUEEN MONITORING CAGE (QMC) IS A PATENTED SYSTEM FOR MAINTAINING AND MONITORING QUEEN HONEY BEES IN THE LAB. THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR DOZENS OR EVEN HUNDREDS OF QUEENS (EACH WITH A SMALL RETINUE OF 50-200 WORKERS) TO BE HOUSED IN A SINGLE INCUBATOR OR SIMILAR ENCLOSURE AND EASILY OBSERVED FOR HEALTH AND EGG LAYING BEHAVIOR. EGGS CAN BE ASSAYED VIA A REMOVABLE PLATE SYSTEM, PERMITTING RESEARCHERS TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON QUEEN EGG LAYING, A PROCESS THAT WOULD NORMALLY REQUIRE THE USE OF DOZENS OF FIELD COLONIES. QMCS ALSO ALLOW FOR EGGS TO BE HARVESTED YEAR-ROUND FROM A HIGHLY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT FOR DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS STUDIES ON HONEY BEE DEVELOPMENT OR LARVAL TOXICOLOGY SCREENING. THE SYSTEM CAN THUS FACILITATE BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH IN THE ACADEMIC, GOVERNMENT, AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS. HOWEVER, SEVERAL KEY INNOVATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO BRING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO MARKET. IN PHASE I OF THIS SBIR GRANT, FORGEBEE WILL COMPLETE THREE MAIN TASKS TO ADVANCE THE QMC TOWARDS COMMERCIALIZATION: 1) USE AFFORDABLE RASPBERRY PI POWERED CAMERAS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM FOR THE AUTOMATED TRACKING OF HONEY BEE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN THE QMCS, 2) DESIGN ROBOTICS TO FACILITATE QMC MAINTENANCE AND EGG COLLECTION, AND 3) DEVELOP A MACHINE VISION ALGORITHM TO AUTOMATE EGG DETECTION AND QUANTI,FY QUEEN FECUNDITY.THE QMC IS TRANSPARENT AND HAS OPTICAL QUALITIES THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO CAPTURE TECHNIQUES. IN PRELIMINARY STUDIES, A HIGH-QUALITY MACHINE VISION CAMERA WAS SUCCESSFULLY USED TO PHOTOGRAPH QMCS FOR AUTOMATED BEHAVIORAL DETECTION USING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN). HOWEVER, THE EQUIPMENT USED IS EXPENSIVE (&GT;$30,000 FOR A SINGLE TRACKING SYSTEM), AND BULKY LIMITING ITS APPLICATION IN THE MARKET FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING OF QMCS. TOGETHER WITH ITS RESEARCH PARTNERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN, FORGEBEE WILL THEREFORE ADAPT CURRENT MACHINE VISION TECHNIQUES SO THAT THEY ARE COMPATIBLE WITH INEXPENSIVE RASPBERRY PI POWERED CAMERAS, REDUCING THE COST OF MONITORING EQUIPMENT BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE (TO CA. $300 PER QMC). ALTHOUGH PERFORMING BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS WITH QMCS REQUIRES &LT;10% OF THE TIME AND COST AS A FULL-SCALE COLONY, MAINTAINING MORE THAN A FEW DOZEN CAN BECOME TIME CONSUMING FOR A SINGLE RESEARCHER. TO ENCOURAGE HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING, THE TEAM WILL AUTOMATE THE EGG RETRIEVAL PROCESS BY USING A SYSTEM OF LINEAR ACTUATORS TO RAISE AND LOWER THE PLASTIC COMB PIECE THAT THE QUEENS LAY IN. THIS WILL ALLEVIATE ONE OF THE MOST TIME-CONSUMING STEPS OF QMC MAINTENANCE AND WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO PRECISELY CONTROL THE TIME DURING WHICH QUEENS CAN ACCESS THE COMB AND LAY, WHICH CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL IF THE EGGS ARE USED IN DOWNSTREAM BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS. FINALLY, FORGEBEE WILL AUTOMATE ASSESSMENTS OF QUEEN EGG-LAYING BY DEVELOPING MACHINE VISION ALGORITHMS THAT CAN DETECT THE PRESENCE OF EGGS INSIDE THE PLASTIC COMB. AS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROBOTICS, THIS ADVANCE WILL DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE TIME REQUIRED FOR QMC MAINTENANCE.NUMEROUS ACADEMIC AND GOVERNMENT LABS WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY. FOR INSTANCE, AS PART OF THIS GRANT, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH THREE USDA LABORATORIES. THESE AGREEMENTS WILL NOT ONLY FACILITATE OUR DEVELOPMENT OF QMC SYSTEM, BUT WILL ALSO RESULT IN NOVEL RESEARCH INTO HOW POTENTIALLY TOXIC AGRICHEMICALS, PLANT PHYTOCHEMICALS AND HONEY BEE GENETICS INFLUENCE QUEEN FECUNDITY. HONEY BEES ARE A MODEL SYSTEM FOR ECOTOXICOLOGY TESTING, AND REGULATORY BODIES OFTEN REQUIRE THOROUGH TESTING OF OFF-TARGET EFFECTS ON HONEY BEES BEFORE APPROVING INSECTICIDES AND OTHER BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS FOR REGISTRATION. THIS PROCEDURE IS RIGOROUS AND EXPENSIVE, REQUIRING MONTHS AND POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COMPLETE. MOREOVER, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT (IN EXCESS OF $280 MILLION DOLLARS AND 10+ YEAR DEVELOPMENT PERIOD) IS REQUIRED TO MOVE A CANDIDATE COMPOUND TO THE STAGE WHERE SUCH TESTING CAN BEGIN, RESULTING IN A LARGE LOSS IF IT IS NOT APPROVED. THE SCREENING CAPABILITIES OF THE QMC SYSTEM CAN ALLOW COMPANIES TO TEST COMPOUNDS LONG BEFORE IT WOULD NORMALLY BE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE TO DO SO, POTENTIALLY SAVING THEM TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

(PANNETON ET AL., 2011, 2015, NEIMANN ET AL., 2014, LOMBARD ET AL., 1966, VERPONT ET AL., 2105) BLOCKS OF ONE OR MORE ROWS ARE SPRAYED SEQUENTIALLY FROM THE HEADLANDS BY EITHER A MOBILE CART (GREISHOP ET AL., 2015) OR PERMANENTLY PLUMBED CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE ORCHARD (RANJAN ET AL., 2019). APPLICATION TIMES FOR SSCDS SYSTEMS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER, REQUIRING 30% OF THE TIME A DRIVEN SPRAYER REQUIRES. THE APPLICATION IS FAST, EFFECTIVE, AND CAN RESULT IN SPRAY DRIFT REDUCTIONS OF UP TO 80% (SINHA ET AL., 2019, GREISHOP ET AL., 2019) THERE IS HIGH INTEREST IN THIS TECHNOLOGY: MORE THAN THREE OUT OF FIVE GREAT LAKES APPLE GROWERS IDENTIFIED SSCDS AS A RESEARCH AREA OF HIGH PRIORITY (LEDEBUHR, PERS. COMM. 2016). THE LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM TRICKL-EEZ AND MULTIPLE CHEMICAL SUPPLIERS SHOWS THAT THE SUPPLY AND SUPPORT INDUSTRIES ARE ALSO INTERESTED. THERE ARE NOW OVER 15 YEARS OF FIELD RESEARCH FUNDED BY MULTIPLE SCRI GRANTS THAT PROVE SSCDS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MEANS TO APPLY PESTICIDES (AGNELLO ET AL., 2006, OWEN-SMITH ET AL., 2019, GREISHOP ET AL., 2018). ADAPTING HARDWARE DESIGNED FOR IRRIGATION TO THE MUCH MORE DEMANDING TASK OF APPLYING PESTICIDES HAS IDENTIFIED MANY TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES. (AGNELLO ET AL., 2006, SHARDA ET AL., 2013) SOME, SUCH AS IMPROVED NOZZLES, HAVE BEEN SOLVED (SINHA ET AL., 2019 AND GULER ET AL, 2020). OTHERS, SUCH AS UNUSED DRAINABLE VOLUME, COST OF INSTALLATION AND OPERATION, AND LONG-TERM SYSTEM RELIABILITY IN THE FACE OF RESIDUES AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY, HAVE PERSISTED, BUT WILL BE SOLVED BY THIS PROJECT. PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE WORK ON WHAT WE CALL THE \"Z-SYSTEM\" HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. IN THIS PROJECT IT WILL BE VALIDATED AS SUITABLE TO THE NEEDS OF HDO AND PA GROWERS, WHO NEED A DESIGN THAT WILL OPERATE RELIABLY, REPEATEDLY, WITHOUT MAINTENANCE, THROUGH HEAT AND FREEZE-THAW CYCLES, FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS IN FIELD INSTALLATIONS.PA IS CRITICAL FOR FUTURE GROWTH OF MANY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AS IT INCREASES THE GROWING SEASON, REDUCES WATER USE, AND INCREASES YIELDS OVER FIELD GROWN CROPS. WHEN GROWING AREAS ARE SEALED OR SCREENED, IT EASES CONTROL OF INSECTS AND IMPROVES SPRAY APPLICATION CONDITIONS.

THE PROPOSED RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL ENCOMPASSES THE COMPLEXITY OF REAL-WORLD RISK, IS USABLE IN RURAL SETTINGS WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS, AND TAKES LESS THAN 44 SECONDS TO RECORD AN OBSERVATION, CALCULATE A RISK SCORE, AND SUGGEST RISK-REDUCING CHANGESULTIMATE GOALS:CURRENTLY, SMALL AND MID-SIZED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE SAME INSURANCE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS OR SAFETY REGULATIONS AS LARGE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OSHA INSPECTION AUTHORIZATION/JURISDICTION, WHICH TYPICALLY ONLY COVERS FARMS WITH 11 OR MORE NON-FAMILY EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE (E.G. CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON), AS REQUIREMENTS VARY BETWEEN SOME STATES. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO SAFETY REGULATIONS IN PLACE FOR WORKING YOUTH EMPLOYED BY THEIR PARENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, SKID STEERS CANNOT BE OPERATED ON A CONSTRUCTION SITE BY A WORKER UNDER AGE 18. YET, AGRICULTURAL OPERATORS EMPLOYING THEIR OWN CHILD CAN PUT THEM IN THE OPERATOR (OR PASSENGER) SEAT AT ANY AGE (HEALY, 2018). WHILE VISIMO INTENDS TO MARKET THE PROPOSED SOLUTION TO SMALL FARMS AS A METHOD TO INCREASE SAFETY FOR WORKERS AND FAMILY WORKING AND LIVING ON FARMS,THE ADVANCEMENT OF FUTURE SAFETY REGULATIONS COULD ENABLE VISIMO TO MARKET DIRECTLY TO INSURANCE AGENCIES AS A METHOD FOR SITE EVALUATION, PERHAPS ENCOURAGING PREMIUM DISCOUNTS FOR FARMS THAT UTILIZE THE TOOL.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "5c016687-bb74-4d3e-1056-45ff142b5047-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20224000036950_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 146686048, "Award ID": "20224000036949", "Award Amount": 124815.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-02-22", "CFDA Number": "10.212", "Description": "THE ADOPTION OF SAMBUCUS AS A CONSTITUENT OF REGIONALLY PRODUCED WINES IS WITHIN REACH, BUT RELIES ON STANDARDIZATION OF CULTIVATION PRACTICES TAILORED TO SUPERIOR VARIETIES DEVELOPED FOR USE WITHIN THE FLORIDA WINE-MAKING INDUSTRY. LOGISTICAL LIMITATIONS HAVE LONG REDUCED THE DOMESTIC ELDER CROP&#39;S COMMERCIAL VIABILITY DUE TO GLOBAL COMPETITION, WITH THE UNFORTUNATE RESULT BEING THAT THE ELDER USED IN MOST MARKETS WITHIN THE US IS ROUTINELY IMPORTED FROM EUROPE ALONG WITH PARTICULAR PROBLEMS IN PURITY AND POTENCY. THIS PROJECT OFFERS IN-DEPTH RESEARCH ON THE CREATION OF A VIABLE DOMESTIC PRODUCT TO BE CONSUMED AS A SINGULAR WINE OR AS AN INGREDIENT OF MUSCADINE BLENDS IN A MANNER COMPLEMENTARY TO THE EXISTING WINE INDUSTRY OF THE SOUTHEAST.BY COMBINING THE USE OF TWO PLANT SPECIES WHICH GROW READILY IN FLORIDA&#39;S CLIMATE WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY OF SUSTAINABLY GROWN SAMBUCUS FOR THE REGIONAL SMALL FARM COMMUNITY. KEY TO THIS SUCCESS WILL BE A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF THE NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF THE FARM PRODUCT IN SEVERAL POTENTIAL FORMS POST-PROCESSING. BY DOCUMENTING HOW THE FARM PRODUCT&#39;S NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION CHANGES THROUGHOUT CONVERSION INTO WINE WE WILL ILLUMINATE THE DETAILS FOR UTILIZATION OF SAMBUCUS BY THE REGIONAL WINE INDUSTRY. ALREADY, MUSCADINE WINES HAVE ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE PRESS IN TERMS OF THE STUDY OF THEIR HEALTH PROMOTING COMPOUNDS. THIS ASPECT OF THE VITICULTURAL AND ENOLOGICAL DOCUMENTATION OF MUSCADINE WINES WILL BE ENHANCED SYNERGISTICALLY THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF SAMBUCUS DERIVED WINE PRODUCTS. OUR AIM IS TO COMPLEMENT THE EXISTING WINES OF OUR REGION, NOT TO COMPETE DIRECTLY, AS THERE IS PLENTY OF POTENTIAL MARKET SHARE TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH A COOPERATIVE APPROACH.SAMBUCUS PRODUCTS AND SUPPLEMENTS HAVE WITNESSED MARKED SALES GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS, WITH A FIVE-FOLD INCREASE TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT $110 MILLION FROM 2017 TO 2019. THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY IN THE SOUTHEAST IS POISED TO CATCH UP WITH NATIONAL TRENDS. REGIONAL WINE PRODUCERS WHO WANT TO USE A QUALITY, REPLICABLE PRODUCT FOR BOTH ELDER WINES AND AS AN ADDITIVE IN MUSCADINE WINES WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS WORK.

CONSUMERS WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEIR FOOD AND DRINKS COME FROM AND HOW THEY WERE PRODUCED. THIS SHIFT FAVORS SMALL, TRANSPARENT, SUSTAINABILITY-FOCUSED FARMS. PEOPLE HAVE LONG CONSUMED WINE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE HEALTH BENEFITS IT OFFERS WHEN IMBIBED IN MODERATION.

THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF AMMONIA (NH3), A COLORLESS, PUNGENT GAS THAT FORMS AS A BYPRODUCT OF AGRICULTURAL WASTE, AND IS COMMONLY FOUND IN CLEANING AGENTS USED IN COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL SETTINGS. AMMONIA GAS IS A SIGNIFICANT HAZARD TO HUMAN HEALTH, LIVESTOCK, AND CROPS, WITH THE SEVERITY OF HEALTH EFFECTS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE DOSE, DURATION, AND EXPOSURE ROUTE. IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER, AMMONIA CAN CONVERT TO AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE WHICH IS STRONGLY CORROSIVE AND TOXIC. CONTACT WITH SMALL AMOUNTS OF AMMONIA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE EYES AND RESPIRATORY TRACTS OF BOTH HUMANS AND LIVESTOCK, WHILE EXPOSURE TO LARGER AMOUNTS OF AMMONIA GAS CAN CAUSE BLINDNESS AND/OR PERMANENT LUNG DAMAGE. OSHA HAS SET A 50-PPM LIMIT FOR AMMONIA EXPOSURE OVER AN 8-HOUR WORK DAY, AND THE EPA CONSIDERS 300 PPM EXPOSURE TO BE IMMEDIATELY THREATENING TO HUMAN LIFE.NEED: TODAY, ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF AMMONIA POLLUTION ARE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO COLLECT IN AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS. AS A RESULT, THE SOURCES OF AMMONIA GENERATION AND ITS SUBSEQUENT DIFFUSION BEHAVIOR ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT, AND THE TRUE OUTPUT OF AMMONIA POLLUTION IS FREQUENTLY UNDERESTIMATED. UNDERSTANDING AMMONIA POLLUTION CAN HAVE CRITICAL IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISES. A CONSEQUENCE OF AMMONIA POISONING IN MANY FARMS IS A PERVASIVENESS OF UNHEALTHY ANIMALS WITH RESPIRATORY DISEASES, WHICH CAN RENDER THEM UNSAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, AND LOWERING FARM PROFITABILITY. IN RECENT YEARS, AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISES HAVE PLACED INCREASING EMPHASIS ON REDUCING AMMONIA VAPORS TO ENSURE LIVESTOCK LIVE IN CLEAN AND HEALTHY CONDITIONS. THIS TREND IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY MANY HEALTH-CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS WILLING TO SUPPORT FARMS THAT MAINTAIN SAFE AND HEALTHY LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THEIR LIVESTOCK, TO ENSURE THE FOODTHEY CONSUME IS AT ITS HIGHEST QUALITY. THESE CONSUMERS ARE INCREASINGLY LOYAL SUPPORTERS OF \"CLEAN\" FARMS AND ARE WILLING TO PAY A PREMIUM FOR NUTRITIOUS, HIGH-QUALITY FOOD.IMPROVING THE CAPACITY TO ANALYZE AND MITIGATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS OF AMMONIA POLLUTION IN BOTH FARMS AND PROCESSING FACTORIES IS PARAMOUNT. ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH CAN QUICKLY IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT AMPLIFY OR ACCELERATE THE ACCUMULATION OF TOXIC AMMONIA VAPORS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT (I.E. IMPROPER WASTE MANAGEMENT, FERTILIZER OVERUSE, ETC.) ARE NEEDED TO DEVELOP RATIONAL MEASURES TO MINIMIZE AIR, WATER, AND SOIL POLLUTION AND TOXIC EXPOSURE. UNFORTUNATELY, TODAY&#39;S COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AMMONIA GAS DETECTORS RELY ON EXPENSIVE, ANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY WHICH LIMITS THEIR UTILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MORE ACCURATE AMMONIA DETECTORS, SUCH AS THE BOREAL AND NONPLUS LASERS, ARE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE (~$30-$40K) FOR MOST FARMS. ELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS SUCH AS THE GG-NH3 FROM CALIBRATION TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALSO RATHER EXPENSIVE ($1,200/UNIT) AND DO NOT PERFORM WELL IN OUTDOOR SETTINGS.CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO LOW-COST, USER-FRIENDLY AMMONIA VAPOR DETECTION METHODS CAPABLE OF REMOTELY MONITORING AND REPORTING RELIABLE REAL-TIME MEASUREMENTS. MOREOVER, DESPITE THE KNOWN ADVANTAGES OF WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY, MOST AMMONIA DETECTORS LACK THE FUNCTIONALITY TO BE CONNECTED TO A MULTI-NODE WIRELESS DETECTION NETWORK. THESE LIMITATIONS INDICATE THAT THERE IS A CLEAR LACK OF AFFORDABLE AND EFFICIENT OPTIONS TO MONITOR AMMONIA POLLUTION ACROSS 3-DIMENSIONAL LANDSCAPES IN REAL-TIME. CONSEQUENTLY, COMPREHENSIVE TOPOGRAPHICAL ASSESSMENTS OF AMMONIA DIFFUSION WHICH MIGHT INFORM MITIGATION PRACTICES ARE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO COLLECT.VALUE PROPOSITION: SEACOAST SCIENCE PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RUGGED, LIGHTWEIGHT, AMMONIA DETECTOR, THAT FILLS THE CURRENT VOID IN COMMERCIAL DETECTION CAPABILITIES BY OFFERING AN AFFORDABLE AND VERSATILE SOLUTION TO ACCURATELY MONITOR AMMONIA POLLUTION ACROSS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS. SEACOAST&#39;S PROPOSED DETECTOR WILL MONITOR AND QUANTIFY THE CONCENTRATION AND SPATIAL DIFFUSION OF GAS-PHASE AMMONIA IN REAL-TIME, MAINTAIN A RECORD OF THE CUMULATIVE VAPOR LOAD, AND WIRELESSLY TRANSMIT THIS DATA TO A PERSONAL COMPUTING DEVICE FOR ANALYSIS VIA USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL TRAINING. THE PROPOSED DETECTION TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON THE USE OF AMMONIA-SENSITIVE LEWIS ACID TELECHELIC POLYMERS (LATPS) AS CHEMICAL TRANSDUCERS IN MICRO-ELECTRO-MECHANICAL-SYSTEMS (MEMS) CHEMICAPACITOR AND CHEMIRESISTORS. THE PROPOSED DETECTOR WILL FEATURE AN INEXPENSIVE, SEMI-DISPOSABLE SENSING ELEMENT, STRATEGICALLY DESIGNED TO BE REPLACED PERIODICALLY TO ENSURE HIGH OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE WHILE EXTENDING DEVICE LIFETIME. FURTHERMORE, THE SYSTEM&#39;S WIRELESS CAPABILITIES WILL ENABLE EACH SENSOR TO FUNCTION AS A NODE IN AN INTEGRATED WIRELESS DETECTION NETWORK.

ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE WORLD BANK, TRRIGATED AGRICULTURE REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 20% OF TOTAL CULTIVATED LAND, AND ACCOUNTS FOR 40% OF THE TOTAL FOOD PRODUCED WORLDWIDE. THE DEMAND FOR IRRIGATION WATER IS PREDICTED TO INCREASE GREATLY AS A 70% INCREASE IN AGRICULTURAL FOOD PRODUCTION IS NEEDED TO MEET THE DEMAND OF THE GROWING POPULATION. AT THE SAME TIME, COMPETITION FOR WATER WITH MUNICIPAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND INDUSTRIAL USERS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE, WITH 25 - 40% OF AGRICULTURE WATER EXPECTED TO BE RE-ALLOCATED TO OTHER SECTORS. THESE CHANGES WILL LEAD TO FURTHER INCREASE IN THE ALREADY LARGE GAP BETWEEN THE IRRIGATION WATER DEMAND AND SUPPLY. IN THE MEANTIME, AGRICULTURE IS FACING INCREASING WATER RISK AS A RESULT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, WHICH INCREASES THE UNCERTAINTY IN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS AND THEREFORE AGRICULTURE WATER SUPPLY. EXTENDED DROUGHTS HAVE HAD OVERWHELMING IMPACTS ON GLOBAL AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION, AND WILL BE EXACERBATED BY GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. FINDING ALTERNATIVE WATER SOURCES FOR AGRICULTURE IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN AGRICULTURE ACTIVITIES AND ENSURE FOOD SECURITY.ON THE OTHER HAND, AGRICULTURE ACTIVITIES ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH WATER RESOURCES, IN BOTH WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY. AGRICULTURE IRRIGATION ACCOUNTS FOR ~ 70% OF FRESHWATER WITHDRAWAL. INTENSIVE PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER FOR AGRICULTURE HAS LED TO DEPLETION OF DRINKING WATER AQUIFERS IN MANY PLACES. THE USE OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF FERTILIZERS, PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES LEADS TO CONTAMINATION OF SURFACE WATER BY SURFACE RUNOFF OR DISCHARGE OF IRRIGATION DRAINAGE WATER. SALTS IN WATER DO NOT DEGRADE, AND CAN ACCUMULATE IN WATER BASINS AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS. INCREASING SALINITY IN IRRIGATION WATER REDUCES CROP PRODUCTIVITY. MORE IMPORTANTLY, ACCUMULATION OF SALTS IN SOIL WILL EVENTUALLY REMOVE LAND FROM PRODUCTION, LEADING TO LOSS OF AGRICULTURAL LAND. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE, 4.5MILLION ACRES OF IRRIGATED CROPLAND ARE AFFECTED BY SALINE SOILS OR SALINE IRRIGATION WATER, PUTTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL LAND AT RISK.TREATING UNCONVENTIONAL WATER SOURCES AT LOW COSTS AND USING THEM FOR AGRICULTURE IRRIGATION PRESENT AN EXCELLENT SOLUTION TO IRRIGATION WATER SUPPLY. WHEN USING WASTEWATER (E.G., IRRIGATION DRAINAGE WATER, OIL&AMP;GAS PRODUCED WATER) AS THE WATER SOURCE, THE TREATMENT AND REUSE OF THE WASTE STREAMS NOT ONLY ERADICATE THE NEED FOR WASTEWATER DISPOSAL, BUT ALSO CREATE ADDITIONAL, HIGH QUALITY IRRIGATION WATER SUPPLY. THEREFORE, TREATMENT AND REUSE OF AGRICULTURE WASTEWATER FOR IRRIGATION AND OTHER AGRICULTURE APPLICATIONS IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE AS IT REDUCES THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE ON WATER QUALITY WHILE REDUCING FRESHWATER USE. CURRENTLY, IRRIGATION DRAINAGE IS EITHER DISCHARGED INTO SURFACE WATER, OR COLLECTED IN LARGE EVAPORATION PONDS, BOTH CAUSING A MYRIAD OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.ONE IMPORTANT CHALLENGE IN THE TREATMENT OF THESE ALTERNATIVE WATER SOURCES IS THE NEED TO REMOVE SALTS, I.E., DESALINATION, WHICH IS HIGHLY ENERGY INTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE IF USING EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES. IRRIGATION USING ALTERNATIVE WATER SOURCES WILL ONLY BE A VIABLE SOLUTION IF THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND TOTAL COSTS FOR DESALINATION OF THE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVE IRRIGATION WATER SOURCES CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED. SOLMEM&#39;S SOLARMEMD TECHNOLOGY CAN DESALINATE SALINE STREAMS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) SUCH AS IRRIGATION DRAINAGE WATER HIGHLY EFFICIENTLY, USING SUNLIGHT AS THE ENERGY SOURCE. ITS LOW ELECTRICAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND LOW CAPITAL COSTS RESULT IN A LEVELIZED COST OF WATER SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN EXISTING TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES, MAKING IT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE TO UTILIZE LOCALLY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE WATER SOURCES FOR AGRICULTURE IRRIGATION.SOLAR DESALINATION CAN HELP SOLVE WATER SHORTAGES IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER, WHILE MINIMIZING CONTAMINATION IN WATER MANAGEMENT AND FOOD PRODUCTION. IN SUMMARY, OUR TECHNOLOGY BRINGS THE FOLLOWING BENIFITS:1) IT CAN IMPROVE FARMING ACTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SOIL AND IRRIGATION WATER. ACCUMULATION OF SALTS IN IRRIGATION WATER AND SOIL IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THREATENING PRODUCTIVITY OF IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE IN MANY AREAS IN THE US. THE SOLARMEMD PROCESS EFFECTIVELY REMOVES TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) OR SALINITY, AS WELL AS OTHER CONTAMINANTS (E.G., ARSENIC, SELENATE AND BORON) FROM IRRIGATION DRAINAGE WATER OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE IRRIGATION WATER SOURCES USING SOLAR ENERGY. THIS CAN PREVENT SALTS IN THE IRRIGATION WATER FROM ACCUMULATING IN SOIL OR CONTAMINATING SURFACE WATER IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS THROUGH DISCHARGE OF IRRIGATION DRAINAGE WATER, MAKING IT AN ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE SOLUTION TO FARMLAND SALT MANAGEMENT. IT ALSO KEEPS OTHER CONTAMINANTS BELOW TOXIC THRESHOLDS FOR HIGH CROP PRODUCTION AND PREVENTS CONTAMINANT ACCUMULATION THROUGH THE FOOD CHAIN. 2) IT EQUIPS FARMERS AS WELL AS LOCAL AND REGIONAL WATER AGENCIES WITH A COST-EFFECTIVE METHOD TO COMBAT SEVERE DROUGHTS BY ENABLING REUSE OF IRRIGATION DRAINAGE WATER AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE WATER SOURCES AT A LOW COST USING RENEWABLE ENERGY. THIS WILL GREATLY REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY IN FARM PRODUCTIVITY CAUSED BY INCREASINGLY UNPREDICTABLE PRECIPITATION PATTERNS RESULTING FROM GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. 3) IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SOLARMEMD TECHNOLOGY CAN REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE BY REDUCING ITS WATER FOOTPRINT AND LOWERING THE LOAD OF CONTAMINANTS IN AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF. USING ALTERNATIVE WATER SOURCES REDUCES FRESHWATER WITHDRAWAL FOR AGRICULTURE, THE LARGEST WATER USER AMONG ALL SECTORS. THIS HELPS RELIEVE WATER RESOURCE-RELATED CONFLICTS IN WATER STRESSED AREAS. TREATMENT AND REUSE OF IRRIGATION DRAINAGE WATER AND SURFACE RUNOFF ALSO REDUCES THE DISCHARGE OF CONTAMINANTS, E.G., FERTILIZERS, PESTICIDES, AND HERBICIDES INTO SURFACE WATER BODIES, AND ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR LARGE EVAPORATION PONDS, AVOIDING THEIR NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (E.G., HARM TO WATERFOWLS) WHILE RECLAIMING THE LANDS USED FOR FARMING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4577e5f8-91c1-1a38-2adb-7531273ac999-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20223361037529_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 149039643, "Award ID": "20223353037485", "Award Amount": 174999.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-05-19", "CFDA Number": "10.212", "Description": "RECENT COLONY LOSSES EXPERIENCED BY BEEKEEPERS ARE UNSUSTAINABLE, AND CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE, REACHING ANNUAL AVERAGES OF 25-50% COLONY MORTALITY FOR MOST PARTS OF THE US IN 2020/2021 (SEE MAP BELOW). DEFORMED WING VIRUS (DWV) IS A PRINCIPAL PATHOGEN OF HONEY BEES, AND DWV LEADS TO DEVASTATING MORPHOLOGICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, IMMUNOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL IMPACTS THAT KILL SYMPTOMATIC BEES, WEAKENS, REDUCE THE LIFESPAN AND ALTERS THE BEHAVIOR OF ASYMPTOMATIC BEES, AND RESULTS IN SEVERE COLONY MORBIDITY AND EVENTUALLY COLONY MORTALITY. DWV IS VECTORED BY THE PARASITIC MITE VARROA DESTRUCTOR, AND DWV HAS BECOME MORE VIRULENT AND PREVALENT SINCE THE ARRIVAL AND SPREAD OF VARROA MITES ACROSS THE US. DWV IS THE PATHOGEN MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER (CCD) AND THE EXTREMELY HIGH RECURRENT ANNUAL COLONY MORTALITY EXPERIENCED BY BEEKEEPERS IN THE 21ST CENTURY. DWV, CCD AND ELEVATED POLLINATOR MORTALITY THREATEN POLLINATION OF CROPS AND OTHER PLANTS DEPENDENT UPON HONEY BEES AND NATIVE HYMENOPTERAN POLLINATORS (WHICH ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY DWV).

THESE BEEWEAVER BEES ARE A GENETIC RESOURCE DEVELOPED BY THE PI. THE TARGET FOR PHASE I IS TO ACCELERATE PRODUCTION OF QUEENS WITH ENHANCED AND MORE UNIFORM DWV RESISTANCE. BEEWEAVER HAS THE CAPABILITY, EQUIPMENT, COLONIES AND MATING NUCLEI TO REAR AND PRODUCE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF QUEENS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DRONES TO COMMERCIALIZE THIS STRAIN AND SELL QUEENS TO BEEKEEPERS ACROSS THE US.

OUR MISSION IS TO ENABLE GENERATIONS OF FARMERSBY ACCELERATING THE INTERSECTION OF PROMISING MODERN TECHNOLOGIESTO ADVANCE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF FOOD. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS DEVELOPING A COMPUTE PLATFORM FOR INDOOR AGRICULTURE. A PLATFORM CONSISTS OF HARDWARE, DATA STORAGE DEVICES, SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND NETWORKS THAT SUPPORT THE PROCESSING AND EXCHANGE OF ELECTRONIC INFORMATION. IN THIS CASE, WE ARE DEVELOPING A PLATFORM USED FOR MONITORING AND MAINTAINING BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL, AND PHYSICAL ELEMENTS WITHIN INDOOR GROWING ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS GREENHOUSES, REPURPOSED WAREHOUSES, DRY DOCKS, MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, BARNS, AND SHIPPING CONTAINERS. OUR INITIAL TARGET WITH THIS INDUSTRY IS AQUAPONICS, ONE OF THE FASTEST-GROWING INDUSTRIES IN THE U.S. (MORDOR INTELLIGENCE, 2021).A KEY MOTIVATION FOR MAKING AQUAPONICS OUR BEACHHEAD IS THE GLOBAL WATER CRISIS. THE WORLD BANK (2021) ESTIMATES THAT FUTURE DEMAND ON FRESH WATER RESOURCES BY ALL SECTORS WILL REQUIRE AS MUCH AS 25-40% OF WATER TO BE REALLOCATED FROM LOWER TO HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN WATER STRESSED REGIONS. GIVEN THAT AGRICULTURE ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 70% OF FRESHWATER CONSUMPTIVE WITHDRAWALS GLOBALLY (GODDEK, ET AL., 2019), SUPPORTING THE GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF AQUAPONICS REPRESENTS A HIGHLY PROMISING APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLY FEEDING THE WORLD. AQUAPONICS IS ORGANIC AGRICULTURE THAT PAIRS FISH AND PLANT CULTIVATION INTO A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL GROWING SYSTEM USING AN AVERAGE OF 5% OF THE WATER TYPICALLY USED TO GROW THE SAME PLANTS IN SOIL (KELLY, 2021). WELL-DESIGNED AQUAPONICS PRODUCES AN AVERAGE OF 30-40% HIGHER YIELDS THAN PLANTS GROWN IN SOIL USING A FRACTION OF THE ENERGY AND OTHER COSTLY EXTERNAL INPUTS (FERNADEZ-CABANAS, ET AL., 2020) WHILE PRODUCING LITTLE POLLUTION (MALLICK ET AL., 2021).AS PROMISING AS THIS NOVEL FARMING APPROACH IS, AQUAPONICS COMES WITH RISKS AND REQUIRES DEEP KNOWLEDGE TO BE SUCCESSFUL (TURN&SCARON;EK ET AL., 2019). HOWEVER, A WORLDWIDE SURVEY OF COMMERCIAL AQUAPONIC GROWERS FOUND THAT ONLY 59% OF RESPONDENTS HAD SOME RELEVANT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE DURING THE START-UP PHASE; 41% CLAIMED TO HAVE INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH FISH AND PLANTS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. APPROXIMATELY 1/3 OF AQUAPONIC BUSINESSES ARE STARTED BY ENTREPRENEURS WITH NO PRIOR TRAINING OR EXPERIENCE IN GROWING FISH OR PLANTS (GREENFIELD, 2020). HIGH INITIAL FINANCIAL OUTLAYS ON AQUAPONICS SYSTEMS AND A STEEP LEARNING CURVE PRESSURED BY TIGHT PROFIT MARGINS OFTEN RESULT IN FAILURE OR AT BEST, AN AVERAGE OF 7-TO-12 YEARS TO PAY OFF INVESTMENTS (BAGANZ ET AL., 2020). OUR SMART INDOOR FARM MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT TOOLS WILL ADVANCE ADOPTION AND SUCCESS OF AQUAPONICS FARMING BY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING PAIN POINTS AND RISKS.EXISTING INDOOR AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS DIGITAL PROBES FOR COLLECTING DATA SUFFER FROM AN INABILITY TO COMPILE AND INTERPRET INFORMATION DUE TO A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. CURRENTLY,A NON-PROPRIETARY MODULAR PLUG AND PLAY PLATFORM APPROACH TUNED FOR INDOOR AGRICULTURE TO INTEGRATE RELEVANT SENSORS AND THE DATA THEY PRODUCE IS NON-EXISTENT. THE FUSION OF RELEVANT AND DISPARATE DATASETS IS REQUIRED TO AIDE FARMERS TO IMPROVE THEIR RESPECTIVE GROWING OPERATIONS (OPEN AG DATA ALLIANCE, 2021). OUR TECHNOLOGY WILL ADVANCE USDA STRATEGIC GOAL 2 (MAXIMIZING THE ABILITY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS TO PROSPER) AND NIFA PRIORITIES BY ACCELERATING CONTROLLED AGRICULTURAL GROWING SYSTEMS BY ENABLING PRECISION CONTROLS FOR INDOOR GROWING THAT CONSERVE WATER AND ENERGY WHILE PRODUCING HEALTHY FOOD FOR GROWING POPULATIONS.THE GOAL OF THIS USDA NIFA SBIR PHASE I FEASIBILITY STUDY IS TO ADVANCE CRITICAL ENABLING FEATURES OF AN ON-PREMISE SMART SERVICE FOR FARMING APPLICATIONS. THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TEST AND EVALUATE A WELL-ESTABLISHED OPEN-SOURCE COMPUTE FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE IF THIS SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE TECHNICAL APPROACH IS AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICES. THIS OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE FRAMEWORK IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN MULTIPLE DEVICES (SUCH AS SENSORS) AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.WE WILL KNOW THAT THIS PARTICULAR FRAMEWORK IS A FEASIBLE SOLUTION IF WE ARE ABLE TO VALIDATE THAT WE CAN USE THE SOFTWARE STACK TO ACTIVATE DATA FLOW (I.E., MOVEMENT OF DATA FROM VARIOUS SENSORS IN THE FISH TANKS AND PLANT BEDS TO SOFTWARE), DATA FUSION (E.G., OVERLAYING MULTIPLE PH AND TEMPERATURE READINGS OVER TIME), AND CONTROL LOGIC (I.E., A KEY PART OF A SOFTWARE PROGRAM THAT CONTROLS THE OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM. THE CONTROL LOGIC RESPONDS TO COMMANDS FROM THE USER AND IT ALSO ACTS ON ITS OWN TO PERFORM AUTOMATED TASKS STRUCTURED INTO THE PROGRAM).THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING STEPS ARE CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THAT WE SELECT A SOLID SOFTWARE STACK THAT WILL ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO CODE BETTER AND FASTER WITH A WELL-DOCUMENTED CODEBASE. TESTING TO SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO RUN TESTS ON THE PLATFORM NOW WILL HELPS US TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT HOW EASY IT WILL BE TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM, DETECT AND FIX COMMON BUGS OR PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND TWEAK FEATURES WITHOUT EATING UP TOO MUCH TIME.

REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SOFT LAUNCH WILL FUND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF CLOUD-BASED FEATURES THAT WILL ENABLE MORE ADVANCED DATA ANALYSIS, DATA MODELING, AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT FARMERS&#39; LONG TERM BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND INCREASE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITS.

AS OUR WORLD GROWS, AGRICULTURE PRODUCTIVITY MUST INCREASE TO KEEP PACE WITHOUT REDUCING PROFITS OR INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THIS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION OF AGRICULTURE PROCESSES. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT OPTIMIZE SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT MEASURE ACCURATELY. CROP MONITORING IS AN ESSENTIAL ACTIVITY THAT PROVIDES SUCH MEASUREMENTS ON CROP STATUS.CROP MONITORING INVOLVES CHECKING ON THE CROPS FOR ANY PLANT HEALTH ISSUES, FOR ESTIMATING THE PRODUCE, FOR PLANNING LABOR DEPLOYMENT, OR FOR OTHER FARMING DECISIONS. TRADITIONALLY THIS IS DONE MANUALLY WITH EXPERIENCED FARMERS WALKING THEIR FIELDS AND OBSERVING THE CROPS. CLEARLY WITH MANY HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF FARMS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THIS MANUALLY; ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE FIELDS CAN BE SURVEYED IN THIS FASHION. SEVERAL COMPANIES ARE WORKING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM USING TECHNOLOGY, BUT THEIR SOLUTIONS DON&#39;T FIT WELL WITH PREVALENT FARMING PRACTICES. MANYUSEDRONES, AIRCRAFTS, OR SATELLITE IMAGES, WHICH WORKWELL FORPROVIDING BROAD OVERVIEW OF FARMS, BUT FAIL TO LOOK UNDER THE CANOPY AND OBSERVE ISSUES THAT REQUIRE PER-PLANT PICTURES. MANY REQUIRE IMAGES OF THE FIELDS TO BE UPLOADEDONTO A CENTRAL SERVERBEFORE THEY CAN BE PROCESSED.THE STEP OF UPLOADING IMAGES TO A CENTRAL SERVER IS TIME-CONSUMING AND, IN MANY CASES, REQUIRES MANUAL OVERSIGHT TO COMPLETE. THIS APPROACH PREVENTS CROP MONITORING FROM BEING REAL-TIME. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE UPLOADED LIMITS THE SIZE OF THE FARM AREA THAT CAN BE SURVEYED. MANY COMPANIES PROVIDE CROP MONITORING AS A SERVICE, WHERE THEY DOTHE TASK OF IMAGE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING AND THEN PROVIDE A REPORT. IN SUCH CASES, THEIR MONITORINGSCHEDULE MAY OR MAY NOT MATCH WITH WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE GROWERS. IF A GROWER NEEDS TO DO THE MONITORING EVERY DAY ORWEEK FOR EVERY FARM THEY OWN, IT IS USUALLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR SUCHCOMPANIESTO PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF SERVICE AT A REASONABLE COST.AGROFOCAL&#39;S GOAL IS TO BUILD A REAL-TIME CROP MONITORING SYSTEM THAT IS EASY TO USE, IS AFFORDABLE, AND FITS SEAMLESSLY WITH THE EXISTING FARMING OPERATIONS. THE CROP MONITORING SYSTEM CAN BE MOUNTED ON ANY MOVING VEHICLE GOING THROUGH THE FARM. THIS ALLOWS THE CAMERA TO GET UP-CLOSE, UNDER-THE-CANOPY VIEW OF THE CROP. THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF COLLECTING THE IMAGES AND OPERATING ON THOSE IMAGES TO EXTRACT THE INSIGHTS IS DONE ON THE VEHICLE ITSELF IN REAL-TIME, WHICH ELIMINATES THE TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS OF UPLOADING THE IMAGES TO A CENTRAL SERVER FOR PROCESSING. THE INSIGHTS ARE AVAILABLE AND READY TO BE VIEWED ON AN APP AS SOON AS THE IMAGE COLLECTION IS DONE. SINCE IN THIS TECHNOLOGY THE IMAGE COLLECTION AND THE PROCESSING HAPPEN TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY MANUAL INTERVENTION, IT CAN BE COMPLETELY OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE GROWER THEMSELVES, WITHOUT REQUIRING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE COMPANY PROVIDING THE TECHNOLOGY. THIS WAY THE GROWER CAN MOUNT THE SYSTEM ON THEIR VEHICLE AND DO THE MONITORING AS MANYTIMES AS THEY REQUIRE. THEY CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO MOUNT THIS SYSTEM ON A VEHICLE THAT WOULD BE GOING THROUGH THE FARM TO PERFORM SOME OTHER TASKS. THIS CAN ENABLE THEM TO DO THE MONITORING WHILE PERFORMING THE OTHER TASKS, SUCH AS WEEDING, PEST-CONTROL, SPRAYING, ETC., THEREBY SAVING TIME AND MONEY.THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO STUDY AND IMPROVETHE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE FOUNDATIONAL TO AGROFOCAL&#39;S CROP MONITORING SYSTEM. WE HAVE FOLLOWING THREE KEY OBJECTIVES.(1) DEVICE A ROBUST AND FAULT-TOLERANT PROTOCOL FOR IMAGE STREAMING BETWEEN THE CAMERA AND ON-VEHICLE COMPUTER SO THAT THERE ARE NO DISRUPTIONS IN IMAGE STREAM DURING OPERATION IN RUGGED ENVIRONMENT.(2) DEVELOP AGRICULTURE-SPECIFIC ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE BETTER SUITED FOR RECOGNIZINGPLANTS ISSUES, FRUITS, AND OTHER AGRICULTURE FEATURES AS COMPARED TO EXISTING ALGORITHMS WHICH WERE PRIMARILY DEVELOPED FOR NON-AGRICULTURE USES.

THE EXPENSE OF GROWING CROPS (ALMONDS) IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TYPES - FIXED AND CULTIVATION EXPENSES. FIXED EXPENSES INCLUDE LAND, TREES AND EQUIPMENT THAT AVERAGE 50% OF THIS TOTAL. CULTIVATION EXPENSES INCLUDE 1) IRRIGATION, 2) HERBICIDES, 3) FERTILIZERS AND 4) PESTICIDES THAT CHANGE ANNUALLY BUT CAN BE IMPROVED BY CONSISTENT MONITORING AND RESPONDING WITH PRECISE APPLICATIONS. THE FIRST THREE CULTIVATION EXPENSES ARE NORMALLY MANAGED BY ROUTINE, STANDARDIZED SCHEDULES AND ARE OBVIOUS AND NORMALLY NOT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.

SCIENSS BIOTECHNOLOGY, LLC (SB) HAS THE TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION, AND FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. THIS SBIR PHASE I PROPOSES NEW SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OF DAIRY CATTLE BY ADDRESSING THE CORE ORIGINS OF MOST METABOLIC AND DISEASE PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR IN LACTATING DAIRY COWS. THESE CORE ORIGINS ARE THE METABOLIC, HORMONAL, AND HEALTH CHANGES THAT OCCUR NEAR CALVING.THE TIME PERIOD 21 DAYS BEFORE AND 21 DAYS AFTER CALVING ARE WHEN 75% OF HEALTH PROBLEMS OCCUR IN DAIRY COWS AND IS CALLED THE TRANSITION PERIOD. TWO OF THE KEY PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR DURING THIS TIME WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE PRODUCTS THAT WILL PRODUCED DURING THIS RESEARCH. THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT NOT ENOUGH ENERGY IS CONSUMED TO MEET THE ENERGY DEMANDS OF THE HIGH MILK PRODUCTION DURING EARLY LACTATION, CALLED NEGATIVE ENERGY BALANCE. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THE LARGE INCREASE IN FEED CONSUMPTION THAT ACCOMPANIES EARLY LACTATION CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH THE DIGESTIVE TRACT, TERMED \"LEAKY GUT\" AND THIS CAN LEAD TO SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION.SB WILL ADDRESS THESE TWO PROBLEMS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ASSOCIATED COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES BY DEVELOPING PROPRIETARY RECOMBINANT PROTEINS DESIGNED TO STIMULATE APPETITE AND GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) TRACT HEALTH IN TRANSITION DAIRY COWS.

LI IS STORED IN A HIGH ENERGY STATE IN THE ANODE AND, AS THE BATTERY DISCHARGES, LI IONS AND ELECTRONS FLOW FROM THE ANODE TO THE CATHODE. THE FLOW OF ELECTRONS GENERATES THE CURRENT THAT THE BATTERY ULTIMATELY PRODUCES. CURRENT COMMERCIAL LIBS USE GRAPHITE AS THE ANODE MATERIAL DUE TO THE ABILITY OF GRAPHITE TO REVERSIBLY INTERCALATE LITHIUM. CURRENT CATHODES ALSO USE INTERCALATION CHEMISTRY, WITH COBALT, NICKEL, AND ALUMINUM OXIDES BEING THE MOST COMMONLY USED CATHODE MATERIALS. CURRENTLY USED CATHODE CHEMISTRIES ADEQUATELY STABILIZE LITHIUM BUT THE HIGH MASS OF THESE METAL OXIDES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES PERFORMANCE OF THE BATTERY CELL. NICKEL AND COBALT ALSO HAVE THE DISADVANTAGES OF COST AND AVAILABILITY. THE HIGH COST OF NICKEL AND COBALT CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE OVERALL COST OF LIBS, WITH CATHODE MATERIALS ACCOUNTING FOR 35-37% OF TOTAL LIB CELL PRODUCTION COST. THERE ALSO ARE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF COBALT AS THE GROWTH OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKET INCREASES LIB DEMAND, WITH OVER 60% OF WORLD COBALT PRODUCTION OCCURRING IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.

THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE CAN ASSESS THE EMBRYO VIABILITY QUANTIFIABLE BY MEASURING THE ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE AND OBSERVATION OF MORPHOKINETICS SUCH AS BLASTOCYST EXPANSION RATE, BLASTOMERE SYMMETRY, AND PERCENTAGE OF THE INTACT EMBRYONIC CELLS REPRESENTED BY THE EXTRUDED MATERIAL IN THE PERIVITELLINE SPACE. THE EMBRYO ASSESSMENT TAKES PLACE IN A MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE THAT CAN WASH THE EMBRYO FROM THE FLUSHING MEDIUM, EASING THE EMBRYO DILUTION PROCESS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE CO2 SUPPLY CHAIN IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY INCONSISTENT, WITH DELIVERY DELAYS BECOMING THE NORM. YCH WILL STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF CREATING THEIR OWN FOOD-GRADE CO2 (HERE CALLED BIOCO2) AND RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS (RNG) FROM AGRICULTURAL BYPRODUCTS USING AN ANAEROBIC DIGESTER. ANAEROBIC DIGESTERS ARE A NATURAL FIT BECAUSE THEY ARE A SIMPLE ENCLOSED STRUCTURE WHERE MICROORGANISMS CONVERT ORGANIC WASTE MATERIAL INTO BIOGAS, A MIXTURE OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE, THAT CAN THEN BE UPGRADED TO BIOCO2 AND RNG.TO CARRY OUT THE FEASIBILITY STUDY, WE WILL FIRST EVALUATE POTENTIAL FEEDSTOCK SOURCES, INCLUDING HOP POST-HARVEST RESIDUE (I.E. SPENT PLANTS), SLASH PILES REMAINING AFTER TIMBER HARVESTS IN THE FOREST, AND COW MANURE. WE WILL WORK WITH HOP GROWERS, DAIRY OPERATORS, AND YAKAMA FOREST PRODUCTS, A NATIVE AMERICAN-OWNED LUMBER MILL, TO QUANTIFY THE VOLUME AND TIMES OF THE YEAR THAT THE WASTE IS AVAILABLE, AS WELL AS HOW THE WASTE WILL BE STORED AND TRANSPORTED TO YCH FOR USE IN THE DIGESTER. THE SECOND STEP OF THE STUDY WILL BE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BIOCO2 AND RNG CREATED FROM DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF THE FEEDSTOCKS.

THERE ARE SOME COLLECTION EFFORTS THAT FOCUS ON REMOVING DEBRIS FROM BEACHES, BUT THERE IS NO EFFORT MADE TOWARD RECYCLING THE POW, IT IS SENT TO A LANDFILL. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF POW THAT COULD BE CONVERTED INTO USEFUL, AND PROFITABLE, PRODUCTS. THERE IS ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE RURAL COASTAL ALASKA COMMUNITIES WITH REVENUE GENERATION FOR BOTH COLLECTION AND PRODUCTION.THE PROPOSAL. PARTICIPATION IN RECYCLING EFFORTS CAN BE IMPROVED BY OFFERING COMPENSATION FOR THE RECYCLED PLASTICS. POW CAN BE COLLECTED BY LOCAL FISHERS AND BOATERS AND BROUGHT TO PORT FOR PURCHASE. OCEAN BOUND PLASTIC (OBP) CAN BE COLLECTED THROUGH RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING PROGRAMS THAT OFFER COMPENSATION FOR SORTED AND CLEANED PLASTICS. THE CHALLENGE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEASIBLE LOCAL RECYCLING SYSTEM THAT CONVERTS PLASTICS TO PRODUCTS. THE SOLUTION IS A MOBILE PLASTIC OCEAN WASTE RECYCLER DEPLOYED IN MULTIPLE COASTAL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.THE APPROACH.

CLIMATE CHANGE HAS DRIVEN THE INCREASED PRODUCTION OF CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. RURAL AREAS CONTRIBUTE TO 97 PERCENT OF THE NATION&#39;S LANDS, WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED FOR HARVESTING SOLAR AND WIND ELECTRICITY. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ALSO CREATES A GEOGRAPHIC MISMATCH BETWEEN CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION.  THE FIRST GRID IN THE U.S. WAS BUILT IN 1882 IN MANHATTAN AND NEW JERSEY, AND OUR POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS WERE EXPANDED SINCE THEN AND UNTIL THE 1960S.FOR A POWER GRID TO REMAIN STABLE, IT NEEDS TO RESPOND TO VOLATILITY IN VOLTAGE AND FREQUENCY DISTURBANCES. IF THERE IS A MISMATCH OF POWER GENERATION AND CONSUMPTION, COMPLETE ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE TIMEFRAME TO BALANCE THE FREQUENCY DISTURBANCES AND POWER OUTAGES. EQUILIBRIUM IS WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR GRID SYSTEMS. IN OTHER WORDS, OUR NATIONWIDE GRID SYSTEMS WERE BUILT BASED ON THE CONTINUOUS AND STEADY SUPPLY OF POWER FROM COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS--NOT FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES. OUR EXISTING GRID INFRASTRUCTURES ARE NOT WELL SUITED FOR TRANSMITTING AND DISTRIBUTING CLEAN ELECTRICITY FROM RURAL AREAS TO URBAN CITIES.  CLIMATE CHANGE AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF LITHIUM-ION BATTERY COSTS HAVE LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS. A DETACHABLE IRON-TITANIUM BATTERY INSTEAD OF A LITHIUM-ION BATTERY CAN BE USED FOR POWERING AGRICULTURE VEHICLES. A DISTINCTIVE ADVANTAGE IS THAT A FLOW BATTERY CAN BE RECHARGED BY SIMPLY SWAPPING THE ELECTROLYTE STORAGE TANKS--ALLOWING THE CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS OF THE EQUIPMENT IN FARM FIELDS.  IN THIS PROJECT, WE AIM TO DEVELOP A NOVEL IRON-TITANIUM REDOX FLOW BATTERY WITH TWO DETACHABLE ELECTROLYTE STORAGE TANKS. IRON-TITANIUM BATTERIES COST $80/KWH FOR ENERGY STORAGE--LOWER THAN $369/KWH OF LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES, AND $399/KWH OF VANADIUM FLOW BATTERIES. AN IRON-TITANIUM BATTERY EMPLOYS NO SELF-IGNITING MATERIALS AND ITS ELECTROLYTES ARE COMPRISED OF ~60% WATER--DEEMING IT FIRE SAFE. AS A RESULT, IRON-TITANIUM BATTERIES COULD BE IDEAL DEVICES FOR FIRE-SAFE, LOW-COST, AND LONG-DURATION (&GT;10 H) STORAGE OF CLEAN ENERGY GENERATED IN RURAL AREAS.  THIS PROJECTALSO WANTS TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF USING FREIGHTS AND PIPELINES FOR TRANSPORTING CLEAN ELECTRICITY FROM COUNTRYSIDES TO END-USERS IN METROPOLISES. A FLOW BATTERY SEPARATES ELECTROLYTE RESERVOIRS FROM TWO ELECTRODES. WHEN IT IS CHARGED, ELECTRICITY IS CONVERTED TO CHEMICAL ENERGY, WHICH IS STORED IN IRON (III) AND TITANIUM (III)SALTS THAT ARE DISSOLVED IN TWO AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS, RESPECTIVELY. SUCH WATER-BASED ELECTROLYTES CAN BE TRANSPORTED FROM A RURAL AREA VIA, FOR EXAMPLE, TRUCKS, TRAINS, BOATS, OR PIPELINES TO ANOTHER BATTERY CELL IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION, WHERE CHARGED ELECTROLYTES WILL BE PUMPED THROUGH THE ELECTRODE COMPARTMENTS OF THE SECOND CELL--CONVERTING CHEMICAL ENERGY BACK TO ELECTRICITY. THE SPENT ELECTROLYTES COMPRISED OF IRON (II) AND TITANIUM(IV) WILL BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CELL IN THE RURAL AREA FOR RECHARGING.

POTATO HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FOODS DUE TO ITS LOW COST, LOW-FAT CONTENT, HIGH CARBOHYDRATE, AND QUALITY PROTEIN CONTENTS, AND RICH VITAMIN C AND B. ABOUT 50% OF THE POTATO PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS LOCATE IN THE PEELS AND ADJOINING TISSUES. ABOUT 12 MILLION TONNES OF THE 19 MILLION TONNES HARVESTED POTATOES WERE PROCESSED INTO FRIES AND OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE US. DURING THE PROCESSING, POTATOES ARE PEELED BY STEAM, RESULTING IN THE GENERATION OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF POTATO PEEL (PP) AS A MAJOR SIDE-STREAM THAT IS OFTEN CONSIDERED A WASTE. CLEARLY, RECOVERING POLYPHENOLS FROM POTATO PEELS OFFERS A WIN-WIN SOLUTION THAT NOT ONLY REDUCES THE COST OF NATURAL POLYPHENOLS BUT ALSO ADDRESSES THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES CAUSED BY THE WET PP MATERIALS.THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO COMMERCIALIZE THE SEQUENTIAL HYDROTHERMAL LIQUEFACTION (SEQHTL) TECHNOLOGY FOR HARVESTING POLYPHENOLS FROM PP.

MONITORING WATER QUALITY TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF CONTAMINANTS FROM INDUSTRIAL, AGRICULTURE, STORMWATER, WASTEWATER, AND HOMES IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVING AND/OR PROTECTING THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES.TYPICAL FIELD MEASUREMENTS (MADE DIRECTLY IN THE STREAM, RIVER, OR LAKE) OF WATER QUALITY INCLUDE DISSOLVED OXYGEN, PH, TEMPERATURE, AND SALINITY, AS THESE ARE USUALLY THE MOST COMMON INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT. NITRATE AND PHOSPHATE ARE CRITICAL FOR GOOD CROP GROWTH IN FARMING, BUT WHEN THEY BECOME TOO CONCENTRATED IN OUR WATER THEY CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS, SO MONITORING THEIR LEVELS IN WATER IS IMPORTANT TO PROTECTING NATURAL WATER RESOURCES WHILE ALSO PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.WATER QUALITY IS TYPICALLY EVALUATED BY TAKING A SAMPLE FROM THE BODY OF WATER, AND THEN SENDING IT TO A LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS. THIS METHOD IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE, AND DOES NOT GIVE A FULL PICTURE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER THE ENTIRE BODY OF WATER AND AROUND IT. ANOTHER METHOD IS BY FIXED INSTALLATION SENSOR STATIONS, WHICH CONTINUOUSLY COLLECT DATA AND TRANSMIT IT TO A MONITORING CENTER OR A WEB SERVER. THESE TYPES OF SENSORS TEND TO BE UNSTABLE AND REQUIRE REGULAR MAINTENANCE. OTHER METHODS, SUCH AS COLOR-INDICATING TEST STRIPS AND SOME PORTABLE SENSORS CAN GIVE RESULTS AT THE SOURCE, BUT THEY ARE UNRELIABLE AND NOT VERY ACCURATE, AND NONE ARE SUITABLE FOR WIDE AREA MONITORING. WHAT IS NEEDED IS AN ACCURATE, RELIABLE, INEXPENSIVE WAY TO COLLECT REAL-TIME INFORMATION ON WATER QUALITY OVER LARGE AREAS.OVER THE PAST DECADE, UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES (MORE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \"DRONES\") HAVE EMERGED AS NEW AND VERSATILE TOOLS FOR MONITORING AND ASSESSING THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. DRONES EQUIPPED WITH CHEMICAL SENSORS ARE BEING RECOGNIZED AS VALUABLE TOOLS FOR MONITORING AIR QUALITY, BUT IN WATER QUALITY MONITORING THEY ARE MOSTLY USED FOR WATER SAMPLING AND IMAGING. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL DRONE-BASED SENSING SYSTEM ON THE MARKET TO COLLECT CHEMICAL DATA FROM BODIES OF WATER DIRECTLY AT THE SOURCE, MAINLY DUE TO THE SMALL CARRYING CAPACITY AND POWER REQUIREMENTS OF DRONES.IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL COMBINE OUR PROVEN MINIATURE OPTICAL SENSORS AND WATERPROOF OPTICAL CABLE WITH A COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT READER, AND MOUNT THE SYSTEM ON A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DRONE. THE DRONE WILL BE FLOWN OUT OVER A LAKE, WHERE IT WILL BE DIRECTED TO LOWER THE SENSING CABLE INTO THE WATER AND TAKE MEASUREMENTS. A WATER SAMPLE COLLECTED FROM THE SAME LOCATION AT THE SAME TIME WILL BE ANALYZED IN A LABORATORY TO COMPARE THE MEASUREMENTS TO THOSE FROM THE SENSING CABLE.IOS HAS PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED AND MATURED OPTICAL SENSORS TO MEASURE PH, OXYGEN, AND NITRATE LEVELS IN WATER, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN VALIDATED IN FIELD TESTING WITH GROUNDWATER. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A SENSOR FILM TO DETECT PHOSPHATE. THE SENSOR FILMS ARE INDICATOR MOLECULES THAT REACT TO A SPECIFIC CHEMICAL (I.E., OXYGEN) AND HAVE BEEN IMMOBILIZED IN A POLYMER FILM. THESE CHEMICAL-INDICATING FILMS ARE SMALL AND LIGHTWEIGHT, AND CAN BE CUT OR FORMED TO ANY SHAPE. ALL OF THE SENSORS WILL UNDERGO TESTING TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF EQUILIBRIUM TIME (HOW LONG THE DRONE NEEDS TO STAY AT ONE TESTING LOCATION), FLOWRATE, AND TEMPERATURE ON THEIR PERFORMANCE. WE WILL DESIGN AND 3D PRINT A LOW-COST DISPOSABLE SENSOR CARTRIDGE, WHICH WILL HOLD ALL OF THE SENSOR FILMS. THE CARTRIDGE WILL BE ADAPTED TO FIT ONTO THE WATERPROOF OPTICAL CABLE. THIS ALLOWS THE OPTICAL FIBERS IN THE CABLE TO TRANSMIT LIGHT WHILE BEING PROTECTED FROM THE WATER, AND THE SENSORS IN THE CARTRIDGE TO BE DIRECTLY EXPOSED TO THE WATER. THE INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE SENSORS WILL BE COLLECTED AND STORED BY A COMPACT LUMINESCENCE READOUT DEVICE DEVELOPED BY IOS (SMALL ENOUGH TO EASILY FIT ONTO A DRONE), AND LATER TRANSFERRED TO A COMPUTER WIRELESSLY OR WITH A FLASH DRIVE.THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCHIS TO DELIVER A RELIABLE, RUGGED, ACCURATE, AND INEXPENSIVE WATER QUALITY MONITORING SYSTEM THAT CAN BE MOUNTED ON A DRONE TO SAMPLE AND TEST SEVERAL VARIABLES IN WATER, IN REAL TIME AND AT THE SOURCE. THE USE OF A DRONE WILL ALLOW MULTIPLE LOCATIONS OF A WATER BODY TO BE MONITORED, RATHER THAN JUST A SINGLE LOCATION AS IS DONE NOW WITH A TYPICAL WATER SAMPLER.

THEREFORE, THERE IS A GREAT NEED TO REDUCE AMMONIA EMISSIONS FROM POULTRY FARMS TO REDUCE THE HARM TO ANIMAL AND HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENTIN THIS SBIR PROJECT, TDA RESEARCH, INC. (TDA) IS DEVELOPING A SORBENT AND CATALYTIC AMMONIA CONVERSION SYSTEM THAT INTEGRATES A HIGH-CAPACITY AMMONIA SORBENT AND AN AMMONIA OXIDATION CATALYST TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM TO REMOVE AMMONIA FROM POULTRY HOUSE AIR DOWN FROM20 PARTS PER MILLION (PPM) OR MORE TO THE PARTS PER BILLION (PPB) LEVELS AND THEN CONVERT THE ADSORBED AMMONIA INTO BENIGN GASEOUS NITROGEN AND WATER VAPOR, ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR DISPOSAL. TDA&#39;S AMMONIA REMOVAL SYSTEM IS A SIMPLE DROP IN SOLUTION THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO EXISTING POULTRY (AND OTHER ANIMAL) FARM AIR HANDLING SYSTEMS. TDA&#39;S SYSTEM WILL CONTROL THE NH3 EMISSIONS FROM POULTRY FARMS, KEEPING THEM TO LESS THAN 1 PARTS PER MILLION (PPM) IN THE EXIT AIR. THE PROCESS IS CONTINUOUS AND SIMPLE, PROVIDING UNINTERRUPTED AMMONIA REMOVAL. THIS SYSTEM COULD ALSO BE USED TO MAINTAIN LOW AMMONIA LEVELS (LESS THAN 20 PPM, THE RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM AMMONIA LEVEL FOR CHICKEN HEALTH IS 25 PPM) IN POULTRY HOUSES (AND OTHER INDOOR ANIMAL HOUSING FACILITIES).THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS A SIMPLE, AFFORDABLE, AUTOMATED DROP-IN SOLUTION FOR MITIGATION OF HIGH AMMONIA LEVELS FOUND IN POULTRY HOUSES. IT WILL NOT DISRUPT THE REGULAR DAY TO DAY FUNCTIONING OF THE FARM AS SEEN WITH OTHER AMMONIA REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES. TDA&#39;S SYSTEM USES AN ENERGY EFFICIENT SYSTEM SIMILAR TO ONES LONG USED IN BUILDING HVAC (HEATING, VENTILATION, AND AIR CONDITIONING) SYSTEMS TO INCREASE THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PROVIDE HUMIDITY CONTROL. IN THE POULTRY FARM CASE, THE SAME SYSTEM DESIGN IS ADOPTED TO HOUSE AMMONIA REMOVAL SORBENT AND CATALYST WHILE REDUCING THE SIZE AND PRESSURE DROP (CONCERNS WITH CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES). TDA&#39;S TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM CAN POTENTIALLY BE EXPANDED LATER TO ALSO CONTROL HUMIDITY INSIDE POULTRY HOUSES AND OTHER ANIMAL HOUSING FACILITIES.IN THE PHASE I EFFORT, WE DEMONSTRATED A HIGH REGENERABLE AMMONIA ADSORPTION CAPACITY OF &GT; 3.4 MG/CC (I.E., 3.4 KG NH3 REMOVED PER M3 OF SORBENT) WITH A THERMAL SWING OF BETWEEN ADSORPTION AT 30 AND DESORPTION AT 250&DEG;C AT A VERY HIGH SPACE VELOCITY OF 108,000 H-1. DURING THE PHASE II PROJECT, WE WILL DESIGN AND FABRICATE A SUB-SCALE PROTOTYPE OF AMMONIA REMOAL UNIT TO FULLY DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNOLOGY UNDER SIMULATED POULTRYAIR AT TDA FOR A MINIMUM OF 1,000 HOURS. IN YEAR 1 WE WILL WORK WITH AN ACADEMIC POULTRY SCIENCE DEPARTMENT TO DO MULTIPLE SUB-SCALE TEST CAMPAIGNS OF 2-3 WEEKS EACH TO OBTAIN DATA ON OUR PROTOTYPE ASSEMBLY&#39;S PERFORMANCE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bc22aa27-9417-cfea-2afb-789cf5280d1c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20213941035973_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 140510635, "Award ID": "20213941035937", "Award Amount": 650000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-01", "CFDA Number": "10.212", "Description": "RADICAL PLASTICS INC.

AS A CONSEQUENCE, FIRE ANT POPULATION DENSITIES IN THE USA ARE 5-10 TIMES HIGHER THAN THOSE IN SOUTH AMERICA. FIRE ANTS ARE PARTICULARLY PESTIFEROUS BECAUSE THEY: 1) PREFER DISTURBED HABITATS (HUMAN ACTIVITIES), 2) HAVE LARGE POPULATION DENSITIES (18-35 KG/HA) AND A HUGE NEED FOR RESOURCES, 3) ARE AGGRESSIVE AND HAVE A POTENT STING - THE VENOM CAN CAUSE HYPERSENSITIVITY IN HUMANS, AND 4) HAVE A LARGE REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL (300,000 NEW POTENTIAL QUEENS/HA/YR).DAMAGES RELATED TO FIRE ANTS INCLUDE HOUSEHOLD, CROP AND LIVESTOCK LOSSES, HIGHER EQUIPMENT REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT COSTS, DAMAGES TO THE LAWN, YARD, FARMSTEAD, MEDICAL AND VETERINARY EXPENDITURES, AND COST OF MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT TO CONTROL THEM. IN ADDITION TO THE MOST NOTICEABLE PROBLEM THEY CAUSE, I.E., STINGING OF HUMANS AND ANIMALS, RIFA IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES TO SOYBEANS, CITRUS, POTATOES, CORN, OKRA, AND EGGPLANTS.

SADLY, SEVERAL PILOTS AND CREW MEMBERS HAVE DIED IN PRESCRIBED BURN MISSIONS OVER THE YEARS, INCLUDING WHILE UTILIZING MANNED GROUND VEHICLES.ADDITIONALLY, FOR SAFETY REASONS, AERIAL PRESCRIBED BURN MISSIONS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO CLEAR DAYTIME CONDITIONS DURING AN ACTIVE WILDFIRE CAMPAIGN. SMOKE INVERSIONS OFTEN LIMIT VISIBILITY AND FURTHER PREVENT STAFFED AIRCRAFT FROM FLYING. ON AVERAGE, AIRCRAFT ARE ONLY FLOWN 8 OF THE 24 HOURS AVAILABLE FOR FIREFIGHTING AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS, ONE THIRD OF THE TIME. CONSIDERING THAT FIRES ARE MOST VULNERABLE AT NIGHT DUE TO LOWER TEMPERATURES, SUBDUED WINDS, AND HIGHER HUMIDITY, OVERCOMING THESE LIMITATIONS WITH DRONES COULD ENABLE ROUND-THE-CLOCK FIRE SUPPRESSION AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE FIREFIGHTING CAPABILITIES AND OUTCOMES.CONSEQUENTLY, PARALLEL FLIGHT TECHNOLOGIES (PFT) AND DRONE AMPLIFIED (DA) PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN AERIAL CONTROLLED IGNITION SOLUTION TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM (UAS) PRESCRIBED BURN CAPABILITIES TO MORE THAN 1000 ACRES PER FLIGHT/CHARGE AND ROUND-THE-CLOCK OPERABILITY (DAY OR NIGHT). PFT WILL BUILD A HYBRID ELECTRIC UAS WITH A 10X ADVANTAGE OVER CURRENT ALL-ELECTRIC UAS SOLUTIONS THAT IS CAPABLE OF CARRYING DA&#39;S SCALED-UP PLASTIC SPHERE DISPENSER (PSD) SYSTEM. THE COMBINED TEAM WILL INTEGRATE THE LARGE PSD WITH THE ENHANCED UAS FOR TESTING IN THE FIELD. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION WILL BE SAFER AND OFFER SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS FOR THE US GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR. BASED ON USDA ESTIMATES,USING A PFT/DA UAS FOR PRESCRIBED BURNING COSTS APPROXIMATELY $8,000 A DAY COMPARED TO THE $16,000 A DAY FOR A TYPE LLL CALL-WHEN-NEEDED HELICOPTER, WHICH EQUATES TO A USE RATE REDUCTION OF ALMOST 50%.TARGETED PROJECT OBJECTIVES INCLUDE DEMONSTRATING: 1) ABILITY TO CARRY AND DEPLOY AT LEAST 2000 IGNITION SPHERES PER FLIGHT/CHARGE; 2) ABILITY TO DROP SPHERES WITH EQUAL OR BETTER EFFECTIVENESS THAN CURRENT SOLUTIONS; 3) ABILITY TO OBTAIN REAL-TIME THERMAL AND VISUAL CAMERA DATA; 4) ABILITY TO FLY OVER ONE HOUR WITH LARGE PSD; 5) ABILITY TO REFUEL THE UAS IN THE FIELD IN FIVE MINUTES OR LESS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR LARGE GENERATORS TO CHARGE LARGE BATTERIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b26c536a-03b3-7ade-de0b-7c860ccf3ee5-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20213361035564_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 139651733, "Award ID": "20213361035516", "Award Amount": 600000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-08-11", "CFDA Number": "10.212", "Description": "AMBRO REPEL: A SEMIOCHEMICAL REPELLENT FOR INVASIVE AMBROSIA BEETLES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "cc3ad682-1112-623c-5ccf-2f8d40ee34db-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20213361035516_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 138710309, "Award ID": "20213361035514", "Award Amount": 650000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-15", "CFDA Number": "10.212", "Description": "THE PROPOSED PHASE II RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE VERSION OF THE ELECTRIC FENCE INSULATOR, ADVANCING AGRICULTURAL-RELATED MANUFACTURING IN THE UNITED STATES.

THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE PROFITABLE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO SMALL AND MID-SIZED MEALWORM FARMERS TO LOWER COSTS AND INCREASE SCALE, CONTRIBUTING TO OUR MISSION. ANIMAL PROTEINS SUCH AS MAMMALS AND POULTRY ARE UNSUSTAINABLE AND POSE PRODUCTION AND BIOSECURITY RISKS. WE MUST LEARN LESSONS FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND MAKE CHANGES, INCLUDING HOW FOOD IS PRODUCED. PANDEMICS CAUSE SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS IN ANIMAL PROTEIN. HOWEVER, INSECT FARMS ARE EASILY QUARANTINED AND CAN OPERATE WITH SKELETON STAFF. THERE IS ALMOST NO RISK OF VIRUSES JUMPING FROM FARM RAISED EDIBLE INSECTS TO HUMANS. INSECT FARMING BEING INDOORS MEANS NO EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL PATHOGENS. WITH OUR INNOVATION, SMALL TO MIDSIZE FARMS COULD EASILY FARM MEALWORMS FOR NON-SEASONAL PRODUCTION, PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED INCOME. DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR FOOD SUPPLY IS CRITICAL FOR FOOD SECURITY. THE GOOD NEWS IS INSECTS, IE. MEALWORMS (TENEBRIO MOLITOR), ARE A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION. THEY USE LESS ENERGY, FEED, LAND AND WATER THAN OTHER LIVESTOCK, CONTRIBUTING LESS TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLLUTION. OVER 30 COMPANIES IN THE US ALREADY OFFER PRODUCTS WITH CRICKETS AS A KEY INGREDIENT. ALL THINGS BUGS LLC LED THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSECTS AS A PROTEIN SOURCE, SELLING OVER 15,000 POUNDS OF GRIOPRO&REG; CRICKET POWDER. HOWEVER, COST OF INSECTS IS HIGHER THAN BEEF, YET BEEF REQUIRES 10 TO 100 TIMES MORE RESOURCES. EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR INSECT FARMING ARE PRIMITIVE AND MANUAL (UNCHANGED IN 60 YEARS) RESULTING IN HIGH COSTS. MAJOR FOOD MANUFACTURERS ARE READY TO USE INSECTS AS A KEY INGREDIENT, BUT COST MUST BE ON PAR WITH OTHER PROTEINS. THUS, THERE IS A NEED FOR INNOVATION IN US MEALWORM FARMING TO COMPETE GLOBALLY.THE INSECT-BASED FOOD MARKET IS PROJECTED TO REACH $4.63 BILLION BY 2027. TO BECOME COMPETITIVE, THE INDUSTRY MUST INNOVATE. THE MISSION OF THIS SBIR IS TO CONTRIBUTE VALUE AND INGREDIENT DIVERSITY TO THE FOOD INDUSTRY. OUR INNOVATION IS A STATE-OF-THE-ART, INSECT PRODUCTION SYSTEM (IPS) DESIGNED TO REDUCE COST, INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND SCALE OF MEALWORM FARMING. SUCH INNOVATION COULD LEAD TO THE HIGHEST PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES OF ANY PROTEIN PRODUCTION SYSTEM. WITH THIS SYSTEM, WE BELIEVE MEALWORMS CAN BE PRODUCED AT OR BELOW $1 PER POUND.THIS PHASE II PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A MECHANIZED MEALWORM PRODUCTION SYSTEM. WITH THESE FUNDS WE WILL: 1) EVALUATE/OPTIMIZE OUR PHASE I PROTOTYPES AT 2 SMALL MEALWORM FARMS, 2) DEVELOP CONVEYOR/SEPARATOR SYSTEMS FOR AUTOMATED MEALWORM HARVESTING, 3) DEVELOP A COMPLETE TURNKEY MEALWORM FARMING MANUAL FOR SMALL AND MID-SIZED FARMERS USING OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND 4) PRODUCE/EVALUATE FULLY OPTIMIZED PHASE II MEALWORM FARMING SYSTEMS AT 2 SMALL MEALWORMFARMS.

THIS SCENARIO OF LARGE-SCALE HATCHERY PRODUCTION IN RELATIVELY FEW PLACES IS PRECARIOUS BECAUSE FAILURE OF JUST ONE OF THESE FACILITIES CAN CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT IN SEED PRODUCTION IN THE INDUSTRY.THE REASON THE INDUSTRY HAS DEVELOPED IN THIS FASHION IS THAT, AT LEAST IN PART, SHELLFISH HATCHERIES CAN BE EXPENSIVE TO SET UP, REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL FOR PROCUREMENT OF SUITABLE WATERFRONT PROPERTY, FACILITY CONSTRUCTION, FACILITY EQUIPMENT, AND SPECIALIZED STAFFING.

THE NITROGEN CYCLE IS AN IMPORTANT SET OF MICROBIAL PROCESSES THAT CAN INCREASE PLANT-AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS BUT CAN ALSO LEAD TO LOSSES IN THE FORM OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND LEACHING. IDENTIFYING AND USING THESE PROCESSES TO SUSTAINABLY IMPROVE SOIL HEALTH, INCREASE CROP YIELD, AND MINIMIZE ECOLOGICAL IMPACT REQUIRES A FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR MECHANISMS AND DRIVERS. HOWEVER, THE INHERENT SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF THE SOIL ENVIRONMENT CHALLENGES CURRENT EXPERIMENTAL TOOLS THAT ARE AIMED AT EXPLORING SUBSURFACE NITROGEN CYCLING. NEW APPROACHES ARE NEEDED THAT CAN INTERROGATE NITROGEN PATHWAYS IN SITU AND WITH HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL FIDELITY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A MEASUREMENT PLATFORM CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING AND MAPPING SUBSURFACE NITROGEN CYCLING PROCESSES IN REAL TIME. THE OVERALL SYSTEM WILL ADD NEW KNOWLEDGE AND COMPLEMENT EXISTING TOOLS THAT PROVIDE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ON SPARSE SPATIOTEMPORAL SCALES.

BECAUSE THESE TOXINS ARE DELIVERED VIA PLANT EXPRESSION, H. ZEA AND OTHER SUSCEPTIBLE INSECT PESTS ARE PERSISTENTLY EXPOSED TO LITERALLY MILLIONS OF ACRES OF TOXIN ACROSS THE US AND THE GLOBE. THOSE INSECTS THAT HAVE GENETIC RESISTANCE AND CAN SURVIVE EXPOSURE TO THE TOXIN HAVE A MARKED EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE THAT DRIVES RAPID SPREAD OF RESISTANCE WITHIN PEST POPULATIONS. WHILE REFUGIA REQUIREMENTS HAVE HELPED TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF RESISTANCE IT IS INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT NEW METHODS TO COMBAT INSECT RESISTANCE ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED.

THE CROP IS PRIMARILY POLLINATED BY HONEY BEES, BUT IT CAN TAKE 5 TO 10 COLONIES PER ACRE TO ACHIEVE OPTIMAL YIELDS. THERE IS A NATIVE, SOLITARY BEE SPECIES, OSMIA RIBIFLORIS, THAT SPECIALIZES ON BLUEBERRY-TYPE FLOWERS AND HAS BEEN SHOWN PREVIOUSLY TO POLLINATE THE CROP WELL. THIS BEE&#39;S NATIVE RANGE INCLUDES CALIFORNIA AND OREGON, WHO TOGETHER ACCOUNT FOR 40% OF THE VALUE OF THE US CROP ($320 MILLION). WHILE IT HAS BEEN KNOWN THAT THIS SPECIES COULD BE AN EXCELLENT BLUEBERRY POLLINATOR, IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO USE ON A COMMERCIAL SCALE. THE FIRST STEP IS TO BEGIN PROPAGATING A LARGE POPULATION IN THEIR NATIVE HABITAT. FOOTHILL BEE RANCH HAS LOCATED SITES IN CALIFORNIA, ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, WHERE THE BEE THRIVES AND OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS HAS BUILT A POPULATION OF OVER 10,000 BEES. THIS IS ENOUGH TO BEGIN POLLINATING ON A LARGER SCALE, AS IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT 1,000 BEES PER ACRE ARE NEEDED.  FOR THIS RESEARCH, WE WILL DEPLOY THESE BEES ON A SIGNIFICANT SCALE IN A REAL-WORLD, OPEN FIELD TRIAL, TO GATHER DATA ON BEE ESTABLISHMENT RATE, BLUEBERRY YIELD AND POLLEN SPECIES COLLECTED BY THE BEE. FOOTHILL BEE RANCH WILL TEAM WITH AN ORGANIC BLUEBERRY PRODUCER IN STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA AND WITH SOLITARY BEE EXPERTS AT USDA-ARS AND UC DAVIS. THE STUDY WILL BE CONDUCTED IN SIX 1-ACRE PLOTS WITH HONEY BEES, PAIRED WITH SIX 1-ACRE PLOTS WITH HONEY BEES AND O. RIBIFLORIS. WE WILL MEASURE NESTING ESTABLISHMENT, REPRODUCTIVE RATE, FLOWER VISITATION RATE AND BLUEBERRY YIELD. IF SUCCESSFUL, WE WILL BE ABLE TO PLAN FOR RAISING MORE OF THESE BEES AND SCALING UP THE SYSTEM TO POLLINATE MORE ACRES EVERY YEAR. WHILE BLUEBERRY YIELDS ARE OFTEN GOOD, HONEY BEES ARE NOT IDEALLY SUITED, ANATOMICALLY, FOR BLUEBERRIES AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE VULNERABLE TO BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESSES IN THE ENVIRONMENT. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT POLLINATION CAN BE IMPROVED WHEN MORE THAN ONE POLLINATOR SPECIES IS PRESENT IN A CROP SETTING. BLUEBERRY GROWERS MAY BE ABLE TO IMPROVE YIELDS BY ADDING THIS GENTLE, NATIVE SPECIES AND REDUCING THEIR NUMBERS OF HONEY BEE HIVES RENTED.

OVER THE PAST CENTURY, THESE INNOVATIONS HAVE HELPED AMERICAN FARMS PRODUCE THE GOODS NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN THE NATION&#39;S POPULATION GROWTH AND CONSUMPTION DEMANDS AND HAVE ALSO ALLOWED AMERICAN AGRICULTURE TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE ON THE GLOBAL MARKET. HOWEVER, AS THE YIELDS OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE HAVE INCREASED, SO TOO HAS AGRICULTURAL WASTE AND POLLUTION. TODAY, CHEMICALS RELEASED FROM AGRICULTURAL WASTE ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO AIR AND WATER POLLUTION, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND GLOBALLY. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH POLLUTION DENSITY ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF THESE AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISES COMPOUNDED BY THEIR COPIOUS USE OF INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH CLEANING AGENTS, HAS RAISED AWARENESS OF THE POTENTIAL LONG AND SHORT-TERM HAZARDS.AMMONIA GAS, IN PARTICULAR, IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL POLLUTANTS THREATENING AIR AND WATER QUALITY. ARISING FROM VARIOUS SOURCES OF AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL WASTE, AMMONIA VAPORS POSE A SIGNIFICANT HAZARD TO HUMAN HEALTH, LIVESTOCK, CROPS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT AT LARGE. AMMONIA IS A COLORLESS GAS WITH A STRONG PUNGENT ODOR AND IS TYPICALLY INTRODUCED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM IMPROPER WASTE MANAGEMENT, FERTILIZER OVERUSE, OR RUN-OFF FROM INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH CLEANING AGENTS THAT ARE USED IN AGRICULTURAL, COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS. WHILE THE SEVERITY OF HEALTH EFFECTS DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE DOSE, DURATION, AND EXPOSURE ROUTES, EVEN CONTACT WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF AMMONIA GAS CAN HAVE SERIOUS EFFECTS.WHEN AMMONIA ENTERS THE BODY AS A RESULT OF INHALATION, INGESTION, OR SKIN CONTACT (OR SIMPLY IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER), AMMONIA CAN CONVERT TO AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE, WHICH IS STRONGLY CORROSIVE AND TOXIC. IN PARTICULAR, THE LUNG TISSUE OF BOTH HUMANS AND LIVESTOCK IS ESPECIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO AMMONIA GAS AND ITS DERIVATIVES. SYMPTOMS RANGING FROM BURNING OF THE NOSTRILS, EYES, AND RESPIRATORY TRACT ARE AMONG THE MILDER INDICATORS OF AMMONIA POISONING. EXPOSURE TO LARGER AMOUNTS OF AMMONIA GAS CAN BE CONSIDERED A CHEMICAL EMERGENCY AS OVEREXPOSURE CAN CAUSE BLINDNESS AND PERMANENT LUNG DAMAGE. AS A RESULT, OSHA HAS SET A 50 PPM LIMIT FOR AMMONIA EXPOSURE OVER AN 8-HOUR WORK DAY AND THE EPA CONSIDERS 300 PPM EXPOSURE TO BE IMMEDIATELY THREATENING TO HUMAN LIFE.ON ACCOUNT OF THE WIDE ARRAY OF AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL SETTINGS, THERE IS NOTABLE DIVERSITY IN HOW AMMONIA VAPOR POLLUTION IS GENERATED, DIFFUSES, AND ACCUMULATES. DETAILED MONITORING OF THIS GAS-PHASE POLLUTANT IS NEEDED TO HELP MITIGATE THE THREATS POSED BY ITS INTRODUCTION INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT AND EXPOSURE TO LIVING ORGANISMS. NEW AND IMPROVED CHEMICAL DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALSO NEEDED TO SIMPLIFY AND IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO ACTIVELY AND ACCURATELY MONITOR AMMONIA VAPOR AS IT DIFFUSES. UNFORTUNATELY, TODAY&#39;S COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AMMONIA GAS DETECTORS ARE INADEQUATE, AS THEY RELY ON EXPENSIVE, ANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY, LACK THE CAPACITY TO REMOTELY MONITOR AND WIRELESSLY REPORT REAL-TIME MEASUREMENTS OF AMMONIA LEVELS (I.E. INTENSITY, DURATION, LOCATION, AND CUMULATIVE LOAD), AND ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY USER-FRIENDLY TO BE REASONABLY OPERATED BY NON-TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. MOREOVER, DESPITE THE KNOWN ADVANTAGES OF WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY, MOST AMMONIA DETECTORS ARE NOT EQUIPPED WITH THE ABILITY TO BE CONNECTED IN A MULTI-DETECTOR WIRELESS DETECTION NETWORK. THIS LIMITATION MEANS THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO GAIN AN ACCURATE REAL-TIME TOPOGRAPHICAL ASSESSMENT OF AMMONIA POLLUTION AS IT DIFFUSES ACROSS 3-DIMENSIONAL LANDSCAPES. AS A RESULT, THE TRUE OUTPUT OF AMMONIA POLLUTION IS FREQUENTLY UNDERESTIMATED, AND THE SOURCES ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT. DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM FROM AIR POLLUTANTS SUCH AS AMMONIA, THE USDA HAS IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR IMPROVED DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP IMPROVE AIR QUALITY.IN VIEW OF THIS STATED NEED, SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC. PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW-COST, PORTABLE, GAS-PHASE AMMONIA DETECTOR. SEACOAST WILL LEVERAGE A NOVEL CLASS OF AMMONIA-SENSITIVE POLYMERS TO DEVELOP AN AMMONIA VAPOR DETECTOR THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO A LOW-COST, BATTERY POWERED DEVICE WITH ADVANCED REAL-TIME MONITORING AND WIRELESS NETWORKING FEATURES. THIS DEVICE WILL MONITOR AND QUANTIFY THE INTENSITY AND DURATION OF GAS-PHASE AMMONIA IN REAL-TIME, MAINTAIN A RECORD OF THE CUMULATIVE VAPOR LOAD, AND WIRELESSLY TRANSMIT THIS DATA TO A PERSONAL COMPUTING DEVICE FOR ANALYSIS VIA SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL USER TRAINING. THESE FEATURES WILL ALLOW EACH SENSOR TO FUNCTION AS A NODE IN A WIRELESS AMMONIA DETECTION NETWORK TO ACCURATELY MONITOR AMMONIA VAPOR IN REAL-TIME ACROSS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF 3-DIMENSIONAL SPATIAL CONFIGURATIONS. IN ADDITION, THIS DEVICE WILL FEATURE AN INEXPENSIVE, SEMI-DISPOSABLE SENSING ELEMENT, STRATEGICALLY DESIGNED TO BE REPLACED PERIODICALLY; ENSURING HIGH OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE IS MAINTAINED WHILE EXTENDING DEVICE LIFETIME.

THE STABLE FLY IS ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGING PESTS, AFFLICTING LIVESTOCK ANIMALS IN THE USA AND AROUND THE WORLD. THE USA, AS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF BEEF (&GT;12 MILLION TONS/YR.) AND COW MILK (&GT;99 MILLION TONS/YR.) IN THE WORLD, SUFFERS AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL LOSS OF $402 MILLION IN DAIRY AND $2.01 BILLION IN THE BEEF INDUSTRIES IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE STABLE FLY CONTROL SOLUTION. IN ADDITION, EXOTIC ZOO ANIMALS, WILD ANIMALS, AND HUMANS ALSO SUFFER FROM STABLE FLY BITES, EXTENDING THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR AN EFFECTIVE STABLE FLY CONTROL SOLUTION. CURRENT METHODS EMPLOYED FOR STABLE FLY MANAGEMENT ARE LIMITED, PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON SANITATION, INSECTICIDE TREATMENT, AND TRAP DEPLOYMENT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE AGAINST COMMONLY USED CHEMICAL INSECTICIDES, ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS, AND FAILURE OF VACUUM FLY TRAPS IN CONTROLLING STABLE FLIES HAS CREATED AN URGENT NEED FOR NOVEL, EFFECTIVE, AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE STABLE FLY CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES. APEX BAIT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL BLOOD SUBSTITUTE LIQUID BAIT (APEX-FLB) WITH UNIQUE ATTRACTANTS, PHAGOSTIMULANTS, AND A CHEMICAL INSECTICIDE THAT WILL ENSURE THE ATTRACTION AND DIRECT CONSUMPTION OF TOXICANTS BY STABLE FLIES, CAUSING COMPLETE MORTALITY AND AVOIDING RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO FORMULATE AND OPTIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE LIQUID BAIT IN SEMI-FIELD AND FIELD TRIALS. IN PHASE I RESEARCH WE WILL GATHER EXTENSIVE DATA ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APEX-FLB FORMULATION IN STABLE FLY CONTROL UNDER DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS.

FIRST IDENTIFIED IN 1921 BUT LARGELY RESTRICTED TO SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, ASFV EMERGED IN THE COUNTRY OF GEORGIA IN 2007, RAPIDLY DECIMATED TO PIG POPULATIONS ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE, AND IS NOW CONSIDERED ENDEMIC TO THE REGION. IN 2018, ASF SPREAD TO CHINA. CHINA CULLED OVER 1.1 MILLION PIGS IN HOPES TO CONTAIN ASF, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT SPREAD TO OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING MONGOLIA, VIETNAM, CAMBODIA, LAOS, NORTH KOREA, SOUTH KOREA, AND MYANMAR. MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE US ARE DEVELOPING ASF VACCINES TO PREVENT THE INTRODUCTION OR SPREAD OF ASF. DIAGNOSTIC ANTIBODY TESTS ARE A CRITICAL PART OF MONITORING ASF. HOWEVER, ANTIBODY TEST RESULTS CAN BE CONFOUNDED BY VACCINATIONS, BECAUSE A VACCINE AND A VIRUS CAN CAUSE HOST ANIMALS TO PRODUCE SIMILAR ANTIBODIES. ONE WAY TO OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE IS TO DEVELOP A TEST FOR DIFFERENTIATING INFECTED FROM VACCINATED ANIMALS, ALSO KNOWN AS A DIVA TEST. DIVA TESTS ARE CRITICAL FOR MONITORING INFECTIONS WITHIN A VACCINATED POPULATION. IN THE CASE OF ASF, A DIVA TEST WOULD BE OF GREAT VALUE TO AVOID CULLING VACCINATED ANIMALS DURING AN ASF OUTBREAK. HOWEVER, THE ASF VACCINE IN DEVELOPMENT IN THE US DOES NOT HAVE A COMPANION DIAGNOSTIC DIVA TEST. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF OUR PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP THE DIVA TEST TO DIFFERENTIATE ANTIBODIES FROM ASF INFECTIONS AND ASF VACCINES.OUR DIVA TEST WILL USE A COMMON ANTIBODY TESTING PLATFORM CALLED ENZYME LINKED IMMUNO-SORBENT ASSAY (ELISA). TO DEVELOP THE ELISA, WE WILL PRODUCE PROTEINS FROM THE ASF VIRUS AND VACCINE. WE CAN DO THIS IN OUR LABORATORY USING THE GENETIC SEQUENCES OF EACH PROTEIN, AND WE WILL INTRODUCE THE GENES INTO A PROTEIN EXPRESSION SYSTEM THAT USES INSECT CELLS. WE WILL PRODUCE AND PURIFY EACH PROTEIN FROM INSECT CELL CULTURES AND USE THEM DIRECTLY IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE ELISA. THERE WILL BE TWO ELISAS TO DIFFERENTIATE INFECTIONS FROM VACCINATIONS, ONE THAT DETECTS ASF VIRUS ANTIBODIES AND ONE THAT DETECTS THE ASF VACCINE ANTIBODIES. TOGETHER, THEY CAN PROVIDE AN END USER WITH A CLEAR ANSWER ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAVE A VACCINATED PIG, AN INFECTED NON-VACCINATED PIG, OR A VACCINATED PIG THAT HAS BECOME INFECTED. WE WILL WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH ACADEMIC AND REGULATORY GROUPS THAT STUDY ASF IN LABORATORY ANIMALS AND NATURALLY OCCURRING ASF INFECTED PIGS IN THE FIELD. THROUGH THESE COLLABORATIONS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO VALIDATE OUR DIAGNOSTICS TEST ON REAL SAMPLES TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FOR DETECTING ASF INFECTIONS. FOLLOWING VALIDATION TO DETECT ANTIBODIES FROM ASF INFECTIONS, WE WILL REACH OUT TO THE USDA TO VALIDATE DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES FROM THE ASF VACCINE, WHICH IS BEING DEVELOPED BY USDA LABORATORIES. ALTHOUGH THE ASF VACCINE HAS NOT YET REACHED THE US MARKET, IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT VACCINE FOR THE SWINE INDUSTRY WHEN IT ARRIVES. WE AIM TO DEVELOP AND LICENSE THE COMPANION DIVA TEST FOR THE ASF VACCINE ON A SIMILAR REGULATORY TIMEFRAME TO ENABLE THE PIG INDUSTRY TO SAFELY MONITOR ASF WITHIN ASF-VACCINATED PIG POPULATIONS.

ENTERIC METHANE IS NOT ONLY BURDENSOME TO THE PLANET, BUT IS WASTEFUL BECAUSE IT CREATES UP TO A 12% LOSS OF ENERGY FOR CATTLE (JOHNSON AND JOHNSON, 1995). DESPITE THE GROWING CONCERN BY THE PUBLIC, SCIENTISTS, AND INDUSTRY, FEW PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM EXIST. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH INTO METHANE SUPPRESSION TO PRODUCE AND IMPLEMENT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE SOLUTIONS. WHILE THE PLANET IS IN DESPERATE NEED FOR A SOLUTION THAT MITIGATES METHANE EMISSIONS, FARMERS AND RANCHERS WORK ON SMALL MARGINS AND ARE EXTREMELY PRAGMATIC ABOUT CHANGES TO THEIR PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, SO INTRODUCING A TECHNOLOGY THAT MAKES SENSE FINANCIALLY IS ESSENTIAL.FEEDING NITRATE SALTS IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD TO DECREASE ENTERIC METHANE FORMATION IN RUMINANTS. HOWEVER, NITRATE FEEDING, WHICH IS GAINING TRACTION IN THE CATTLE INDUSTRY, IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN FEED INTAKE, WHICH REDUCES PRODUCTION METRICS OF RUMINANTS, UNDERMINING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF NITRATE AND DISINCENTIVIZING ITS USAGE. BEZOAR LABORATORIES LLC (BEZOAR) AIMS TO COMMERCIALIZE A NEW SPECIES OF PROBIOTIC, PAENIBACILLUS FORTIS, FORMERLY 79R4, AS ITS FIRST PRODUCT. WHEN INTRODUCED TO THE RUMINANT&#39;S DIET WITH NITRATE, P. FORTIS QUICKLY METABOLIZES THE FED NITRATE WHILE ENHANCING IT&#39;S METHANE ELIMINATING POTENTIAL (RAISING IT FROM 47% TO 54%). IN ADDITION, WE PROJECT THAT THE 10% INCREASE IN VOLATILE FATTY ACIDS OBSERVED (VFAS) AND REDUCTION IN METHANE THAT WAS OBSERVED IN VIVO WILL TRANSLATE TO AROUND A 4% INCREASE IN OVERALL FEED EFFICIENCY AND A 0.2% INCREASE IN PRODUCT YIELD (YAN ET AL., 2010; BOYD ET AL., 2011). IN DAIRY ANIMALS (N=18), NITRATE PLUS FORTIS INCREASED MILK YIELDS BY 5.7% ABOVE THE CONTROL WHICH WAS 1.7% HIGHER THAN NITRATE ALONE.OUR FORMULATION IS IN THE PROTOTYPE STAGE AND HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN TESTED IN STEERS WITH A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT TRIAL IN 2016 (LATHAM ET AL., 2019) AND DAIRY COWS IN 2019-2020. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO RECEIVE FDA APPROVAL OF THIS NOVEL FEED ADDITIVE. THE RESEARCH FUNDED VIA THE USDA SBIR PHASE I PROGRAM WILL BE PERFORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH TEXAS A&AMP;M UNIVERSITY AND THE USDA. IT WILL INCLUDE SIXTEEN STEERS DIVIDED INTO FOUR TREATMENTS ; CONTROL, NITRATE ALONE, PROBIOTIC ALONE, AND NITRATE AND PROBIOTIC TOGETHER. THE EXPERIMENT WILL MEASURE METHANE OUTPUTS OF THE ANIMALS. IN ADDITION, WE WILL TRACK THE EFFECT OF P. FORTIS FORMULATION ON ANIMAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE. DATA RESULTING FROM THE COMPLETION OF THESE OBJECTIVES WILL GIVE THE COMPANY FIRM NUMBERS FOR THE COST AND BENEFITS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS TECHNOLOGY AND THE OVERALL BENEFITS IN REDUCING ENTERIC METHANE FORMATION. PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES ON REVENUE ARE AROUND $85 PER HEADPER YEAR. THE COST TO THE PRODUCERS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $22-$29 PER COW/STEER PER YEAR, OFFERING OUR CUSTOMERS AN OUTSTANDING ROI. THIS WILL EFFECTIVELY FINANCIALLY INCENTIVIZE CLIMATE CHANGE REMEDIATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN TEXAS IN 2012 THERE WERE 182 RANCHES WITH OVER 5000 CATTLE, WITH THE MEAN NUMBER OF CATTLE FOR THIS GROUP BEING OVER 19,000 (USDA, 2012).

WE INTEND TO RESOLVE THESE TWO IMPEDIMENTS THROUGH APPLYING TECHNOLOGIES ALREADY DEVELOPED IN OTHER FISH TO PRODUCE STERILE, ALL-FEMALE MAHIMAHI. HORMONAL MANIPULATION OF FIRST-GENERATION LARVAE WILL ALLOW THEIR OFFSPRING TO BE 100% FEMALE, ELIMINATING MALE AGGRESSION. GENE KNOCK-DOWN CAN THEN SUPPRESS DEVELOPMENT OF GONADS IN THE FISH DESTINED FOR PRODUCTION, TO ALLOW COMMERCIAL GROW-OUT TO LARGER SIZES, BEYOND MATURATION. NO FISH FOR CONSUMPTION WILL RECEIVE HORMONAL TREATMENTS OR BE GENETICALLY MODIFIED.PHASE II RESEARCH WILL ADAPT AND REFINE THESE PROTOCOLS FOR USE IN MARINE FISH HATCHERIES, AND THEN GROW THE OFFSPRING OUT IN LAND-BASED TANKS. SEX, MATURATION RATE, GROWTH METRICS (GROWTH RATE, FEED CONVERSION RATIO), AND SURVIVAL RATE OF THE TREATED AND CONTROL-GROUP OFFSPRING WILL BE COMPARED. THESE DATA CAN THEN BE INTEGRATED INTO AN EXISTING BUSINESS PLAN MODEL FOR LARGE-SCALE, OFFSHORE PRODUCTION.

WHILE THE HUMAN COST IS IMMENSE AND TRAGIC, THE COST TO FOOD COMPANIES CAN BE EQUALLY STEEP. THE AVERAGE COST OF A RECALL FOR FOOD PROCESSORS CAN BE AS MUCH AS $10 MILLION IN DIRECT COSTS, AND, EVEN WORSE, RESULT IN 50% DROP IN SALES FOR THE FIRST YEAR. SOME FOOD PROCESSING COMPANIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY WIPED OUT. THE CURRENT SANITATION PROTOCOLS, NAMELY DAILY APPLICATIONS OF SHORT-LIVED DISINFECTANTS, ARE CLEARLY INSUFFICIENT FOR TODAY&#39;S COMPLEX FOOD PROCESSING ENVIRONMENT. SELF-SANITIZING COATINGS, I.E. ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACES, ARE AN IDEAL THEORETICAL SOLUTION FOR ELIMINATING PERSISTENT PATHOGENS; HOWEVER THERE HAS BEEN NO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ANTIMICROBIAL MATERIAL WHICH CAN FULFILL ALL REQUIREMENTS OF HIGH-EFFICACY AGAINST PATHOGENS: EASY TO APPLY, BROAD MATERIAL COMPATIBILITY, NO PATHOGEN RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT, AND COST-EFFECTIVE.THAT MAKES HALOFILM&TRADE; A BREAKTHROUGH PRODUCT. HALOFILM IS A SPRAY-ON PRODUCT THAT WHEN DRIED LEAVES A THIN TRANSPARENT FILM ON A SURFACE. THE FILM IS A POLYMER COMPOSED OF ONE MONOMER TO STICK TO THE SURFACE, AND ANOTHER MONOMER THAT STABILIZES CHLORINE, I.E. N-HALAMINE. HALOFILM TURNS THE SURFACE INTO A CHLORINE BATTERY SO USING A CHLORINATED CLEANING PRODUCT WILL LEAVE A SURFACE COVERED WITH CHLORINE WHICH CAN LAST DAYS. HALOFILM, ESSENTIALLY A CHLORINE EXTENDER, RELIES ON THE EFFICACY OF CHLORINE WHICH HAS DECADES OF USE, AND BROAD-SPECTRUM EFFICACY AGAINST PATHOGEN WITHOUT GENERATING PATHOGENS WITH RESISTANCE.THE VALUE PROPOSITION FOR HALOFILM IN THIS CONTEXT IS CLEAR. THERE ARE TWO MAJOR SCENARIOS WHERE HALOFILM CAN BE OF BENEFIT: (1) ERRANT PATHOGENS AND INCOMPLETE CLEANING PROCEDURES THAT DON&#39;T KILL ALL PATHOGENS HAVE A LOWER LIKELIHOOD OF RESULTING IN TAINTED FOOD PRODUCTS, AND (2) BIOFILMS, WHICH ARE THE BANE OF FOOD PROCESSING PLANTS, HAVE LESS OF A CHANCE TO TALK HOLD FROM THE START. AT THE SAME TIME, A FORMULATION WITH ZWITTERION MOIETIES IN THE POLYMER BACKBONE MAY ENHANCE THE CLEANING EFFORT BY REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF ORGANIC MATTER TO STICK TO SURFACES.BUILDING ON THE SUCCESSFUL RESULTS FROM OUR PHASE I EFFORT, WE WILL PURSUE THREE OBJECTIVES WITH THIS PHASE II. FIRST, WE WILL PERFORM ADDITIONAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO SUFFICIENTLY CHARACTERIZE THE BASE FORMULATION OF HALOFILM, AND A FORMULATION THAT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS IN THE POLYMERIC BACKBONE THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCED NEED FOR CLEANING. SECONDLY, WE WILL PERFORM PRODUCT PERFORMANCE STUDIES TO VALIDATE THE ANTI-PROTEIN AND ANTI-MICROBIAL FUNCTION OF HALOFILM ON REAL FOOD MACHINE WITH CONTROLLED INOCULATION REGIMES. THIRDLY, WE WILL ASSESS THE MANUFACTURING EFFORTS AND PERFORM LIMITED SCALE-UP EFFORTS TO VALIDATE OUR MANUFACTURING APPROACH. THE RESULTS OF THESE EFFORTS SHOULD DEMONSTRATED HALOFILM&#39;S FEATURES, PERFORMANCE AND UTILITY.HALOFILM IS HALOMINE INC.&#39;S FIRST PRODUCT AND IS PROTECTED BY EXCLUSIVELY LICENSEDPATENTS FROM AUBURN UNIVERSITY AND CORNELL UNIVERSITY.

TELECOMMUTERS. ONLINE EDUCATION PROGRAMS OFFER THE GREATEST EASE OF ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING TO MANY RURAL RESIDENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE TELECOMMUTING JOB SECTOR OFFERS ONE OF THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOB GROWTH IN RURAL REGIONS DUE TO THESE JOBS NOT REQUIRING RELOCATION. UNFORTUNATELY, AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF INTERNET ACCESS IS STILL UNAVAILABLE TO MANY RURAL RESIDENTS BECAUSE OF THE LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS OF A TRADITIONAL INTERNET NETWORK PROVIDER SUPPORTING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.ONE SOLUTION, WHITE SPACE SPECTRUM TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A LOWER-COST AND EASIER TO INSTALL OPTION COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL NETWORKS DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE EXTENSIVE CABLED INFRASTRUCTURE OF TRADITIONAL BROADBAND NETWORKS. HOWEVER, EVEN THIS APPROACH HAS ITS LIMITS. DUE TO THEIR FOOTPRINT AND POWER DEMANDS, BASE STATIONS, WHICH ARE NEEDED TO BROADCAST THE SIGNAL, ARE CURRENTLY THE PRIMARY LIMITING FACTOR FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF WHITE SPACE SPECTRUM NETWORKS. EACH BASE STATION REQUIRES A CABLED FEED OR A SATELLITE CONNECTION TO THE WIDER NETWORK AS WELL AS A BROADCAST ANTENNA. THE ELECTRICAL POWER AND FOOTPRINT REQUIRED TO FULFILL THESE NEEDS IS CHALLENGING TO IMPLEMENT THROUGHOUT AN ENTIRE RURAL COUNTY, LET ALONE IN EVERY RURAL COUNTY.FURTHER, THE DISTANCE OF TRANSMISSION CAN GO DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY ON UNEVEN TOPOGRAPHY ACROSS WHICH RIDGES AND VALLEYS CAN LEAD TO TRANSMISSION LOSS; ESPECIALLY, WHEN USING RADIAL TRANSMISSION. FOR THIS REASON, NANOHMICS PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AND FABRICATE PRINTED PASSIVE RELAY ANTENNAS, WHICH MAY BE APPLIED ALONGSIDE EXISTING RIGHTS-OF-WAY (E.G. ALONGSIDE ROADS, POWER LINES, OR FIRST RESPONDER ANTENNA NETWORKS) IN RURAL AREAS. OUR TECHNOLOGY IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT BY DRASTICALLY MINIMIZING THE BURDEN OF LAST-MILE DEPLOYMENTS.PRINTED ANTENNAS ARE INHERENTLY LOW-COST AND SIMPLE TO SCALE TO LARGER PRODUCTION LEVELS. AS WELL, PASSIVE ANTENNA REQUIRE NO LOCAL POWER GENERATION. AS A RESULT, THESE ANTENNA PROVIDE A LOW-COST AND SMALL-FOOTPRINT MEANS TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY AND COVERAGE OF A WHITE SPACE SPECTRUM NETWORK; ESPECIALLY, FOR LAST MILE COVERAGE.

ABOUT ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN ARE OBESE. THE PERCENTAGE OF 2-5-YEAR-OLDS WHO ARE OBESE INCREASED FROM 5 TO 13.9% OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS. CHILDHOOD OBESITY INCREASES RISK OF PREVENTABLE HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES AS WELL AS OTHER PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES. OBESE CHILDREN OFTEN TURN INTO OBESE ADULTS WITH INCREASED RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR AND OTHER DISEASES. MEANWHILE, ADVERTISING THREATENS CHILDREN&#39;S HEALTH BY MARKETING UNHEALTHY FOODS TO THEM AND NEGATIVELY INFLUENCING THEIR FOOD PREFERENCES.GETTING KIDS TO EAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES (FV) IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY TO HELP REDUCE CHILDHOOD OBESITY. FV SUPPLY ESSENTIAL VITAMINS AND MINERALS AND ARE IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN&#39;S HEALTH, GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. YET, MOST CHILDREN DO NOT EAT ENOUGH VEGETABLES-- 93% OF CHILDREN AGES 2-18 YEARS EAT FAR LESS THAN THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNTS AND 60% OF CHILDREN CONSUME FEWER FRUITSTHAN RECOMMENDED.CURRENTLY, MOST PUBLIC HEALTH, GOVERNMENTAL, AND EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS TO INCREASE CHILDREN&#39;S FV CONSUMPTION AIM AT IMPROVING CHILDREN&#39;S ACCESS TO FV. WHILE ACCESS IS ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVE CHILDREN&#39;S NUTRITIONAL INTAKE, ACCESS ALONE MAY DO LITTLE TO CHANGE CHILDREN&#39;S EATING HABITS AND THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF FV. UNFORTUNATELY, FV ARE OFTEN WASTED. STUDIES OF FOOD WASTE IN SCHOOLS HAVE SHOWN THE HIGH FINANCIAL COST OF GOOD FV THAT END UP IN THE TRASH.NEW CREATIVE APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO INCREASE FV CONSUMPTION, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. THE GUINEA SHOW (TGS) AIMS TO INCREASE THE DESIRABILITY AND APPEAL OF FV TO YOUNG CHILDREN, COMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE ACCESS TO FV. FIELD TESTING AND EXPERIENCE FROM SEVERAL PRESCHOOLS SUGGEST THAT THE CUTE GUINEA PIG STAR OF TGS INSPIRES YOUNG CHILDREN TO TRY FV THEY PREVIOUSLY DID NOT EAT. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE TEACHER SAID THE CHILDREN IN HER CLASSROOM ALL YEAR JUST LICKED THE CREAM CHEESE OFF OF THE CELERY. \"A LOT OF THEM HAVEN&#39;T TOUCHED THE CELERY, AND THEN WHEN WE SHOWED THE GUINEA EATING THE CELERY... OK, LET ME HAVE A SMALL BITE.\" SHE SAID THAT SOME LIKED IT; AND SOME DIDN&#39;T, BUT GETTING KIDS TO TRY WAS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT. \"I THINK THE CHILDREN WILL TRY NEW FRUITS/VEGS IF THEY SEE GUINEA EATS IT.\" A PRESCHOOL DIRECTOR SAID, \"THE REALIZATION, \"IF GUINEA LIKES IT, WE LIKE IT TOO!\" HAS MADE OUR LUNCH TIME A WONDERFUL TIME OF FOOD DISCOVERY FOR YOUNG TIMID EATERS.\"THE PRIMARY MARKETS FOR TGS ARE IN EDUCATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH. THEY AIM TO INVEST THEIR LIMITED RESOURCES WISELY BY CHOOSING EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS, SHOWN TO PRODUCE POSITIVE RESULTS. THESE MARKETS REQUIRE MORE THAN ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE TO SHOW EFFECTIVENESS. FOR A BEHAVIOR-CHANGE PROGRAM TO BE SEEN AS SUCH, THE PROGRAM NEEDS DATA THAT DEMONSTRATES EFFECTIVENESS. THIS USDA SBIR-FUNDED STUDY IS WELL-DESIGNED WITH A RANDOMLY-ASSIGNED INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUP AND WILL GATHER DATA OF TGS&#39; EFFECTIVENESS TO CHANGE PRESCHOOLERS&#39; ATTITUDES ABOUT AND WILLINGNESS TO TRY/ EAT FV. IF TGS IS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE, A NEW EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM WILL BE AVAILABLE.METHODSTHIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL DETERMINE IF CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE THE GUINEA SHOW (TGS) IN THEIR PRESCHOOL CLASSROOM FOR SIX WEEKS HAVE A MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD FV AND EAT MORE FV COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP OF CHILDREN IN REGULAR PRESCHOOL CLASSES WITHOUT TGS.RESEARCH DATA COLLECTIONWE WILL COLLECT DATA ABOUT ALL THE CHILDREN IN BOTH INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUP CLASSES AT BASELINE PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION PERIOD AND WILL COLLECT DATA AGAIN FROM BOTH GROUPS AFTER THE INTERVENTION IS OVER.TO LEARN THE CHILD&#39;S ATTITUDES TOWARDS FV, WE WILLASK THEIR PARENT TO COMPLETE A CHECKLIST OF FV THEIR CHILD LIKES AND EATSWE WILL SHOW APPEALING IMAGES OF FV TO THE CHILD AND ASK TO POINT TO THE FACE DRAWING THAT MATCHES HOW HE/SHE FEELS ABOUT THAT FRUIT OR VEGETABLE. THE DRAWINGS DEPICT A FACIAL RATING SCALE OF REACTIONS FROM YUCKY TO YUMMY.ONANOTHER DAY WHEN WE OFFER FV FOR THE CHILD TO EAT, AFTER THEY TASTE, EAT OR REFUSE, WE WILL SHOW THEM THE FACIAL RATING SCALE AND ASK THEM TO RATE THE ACTUAL FV THEY WERE JUST OFFERED, NOT A PICTURE.TO LEARN THE CHILD&#39;S WILLINGNESS TO EAT FV, WE WILLPRESENT SMALL PORTIONS OF F OR V TO EAT ON SEPARATE DAYS.TO COLLECT DATA ABOUT FACTORS THAT MIGHT INFLUENCE CHILDREN&#39;S ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR ABOUT FV, WE WILLASK THEIR PARENT TO COMPLETE A CHECKLIST ABOUT THEIR OWN LIKES OF FVASK THE PARENT QUESTIONS ABOUT DEMOGRAPHICS, SUCH AS EDUCATION LEVEL AND FOOD SECURITYTAKE THE CHILD&#39;S HEIGHT AND WEIGHT (AT BASELINE ONLY)AT POST-INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN IN THE INTERVENTION CLASSES, WE WILLASK ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT GUINEA, THE STAR AND MESSENGER OF THE INTERVENTION, SINCE CHILDREN ARE KNOWN TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH MASCOTS OR CHARACTERS FROM MOVIES AND TV SHOWS, SUCH AS THE LITTLE MERMAID OR SPIDERMAN. THESE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO ENHANCE LEARNING OR MARKETING OF PRODUCTS.TEACHER TRAINING TO CONDUCT THE INTERVENTION - TGSWE WILL TRAIN TEACHERS FROM THE INTERVENTION CLASSES TO IMPLEMENT TGS AND TO DOCUMENT THE VIDEOS SHOWN AND ACTIVITIES THEY LEAD IN A LOG.TO LEARN THE FEASIBILITY OF TGS IN PRESCHOOLSTEACHERS WILL KEEP A TGS IMPLEMENTATION LOGTEACHERS WILL COMPLETE A SURVEY ON THE BENEFITS, CHALLENGES, EASE OF USE, AND SUGGESTIONS ABOUT TGSTEACHERS WILL BE INTERVIEWED TO GIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT TGSTHE INTERVENTION: THE GUINEA SHOWTGS IS AN INNOVATIVE, EASY-TO-USE PROGRAM THAT INSPIRES YOUNG CHILDREN TO EAT MORE FV. THE INTERVENTION IS FOR THE PRESCHOOL TEACHER TO IMPLEMENT TGS FOR SIX WEEKS BY SHOWING ONE VIDEO A DAY TO CELEBRATE A PARTICULAR FRUIT OR VEGETABLE. EACH VIDEO IS LESS THAN 2 MINUTES AND IS FOLLOWED BY A TEACHER-LED DISCUSSION OR BRIEF ACTIVITY FROM THE PARENT AND TEACHER GUIDE TO FURTHER ENGAGE CHILDREN AND HIGHLIGHT THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLE OF THE DAY. THE DISCUSSION MAY DRAW ON PEER INFLUENCE OR FAMILY ROLE MODELS. GUINEA MODELS ENTHUSIASMABOUT FV. YOUNG CHILDREN OFTEN LEARN BY OBSERVATION. TGS INCORPORATES INFLUENCES FROM HEALTH EDUCATION, PSYCHOLOGY, MARKETING, AND NUTRITION AS WELL AS MUSIC AND WORD PLAY. WE WILL ANALYZE THE DATA AND DISSEMINATE RESULTS IN PUBLICATIONS.BENEFITSMANY CONCLUDE THAT A FOCUS ON YOUNG CHILDREN TO DEVELOP HEALTHY EATING HABITS EARLY IS NECESSARY TO CURB CHILDHOOD OBESITY. TGS IS AS AN AGE-APPROPRIATE, ENJOYABLE RESOURCE TO PROMOTE FV AND REACH A CRITICAL GROUP OF CHILDREN 2-7Y. TGS ENHANCES AND COMPLEMENTS OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO FV, BECAUSE TGS INCREASES THE DESIRABILITY OF FV. IF CHILDREN EAT MORE FV, THEY BENEFIT NUTRITIONALLY AS THESE PROGRAMS INTEND. TGS MAY HELP TO REDUCE FOOD WASTE WHICH HAS BEEN COMMON IN THIS AGE GROUP, AND THUS MAY HELP REDUCE DOLLARS LOST TO FOOD WASTE. IF THE STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT TGS INSPIRES CHILDREN TO EAT MORE VEGETABLES, THIS WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH AND ACCOMPLISHMENT SINCE CHILDREN CONTINUE TO BE FAR AWAY FROM THE RECOMMENDED STANDARD FOR VEGETABLE INTAKE. TGS PROGRAM WOULD BE OF BENEFIT TO THE EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SECTORS. THESE INCLUDE PRESCHOOLS, KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE, AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS, AND HOMESCHOOL PROGRAMS. TEACHERS WILL HAVE A QUICK, FUN, AND EASY-TO-USE RESOURCE THAT EFFECTIVELY TEACHES HEALTHY CHOICES IN A WAY THAT CHILDREN ENJOY. ALSO, TGS IS AN EARLY LITERACY RESOURCE AND TEACHING TOOL FOR HEALTH AND SCIENCE.

BLOWING DUST IS PRODUCED WHEN THE TOPSOIL IS ERODED BY HIGH WINDS. HIGH DUST CONCENTRATIONS CAN CAUSE BROWNOUTS ON HIGHWAYS, LEADING TO UNSAFE DRIVING CONDITIONS. HIGH DUST CONCENTRATIONS ALSO HAVE SERIOUS HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS IN SENSITIVE INDIVIDUALS. ONE PARTICULAR SIZE FRACTION OF DUST IS KNOWN AS \"PM10\" (THAT IS, PARTICULATE MATTER WITH AERODYNAMIC DIAMETER LESS THAN 10 MICRONS). PM10 IS LESS THAN ONE FIFTH THE DIAMETER OF A HUMAN HAIR AND CAN TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES AND BE INHALED BY HUMANS CAUSING HARM TO THE RESPIRATORY TRACT (I.E. LUNGS), LEADING TO CHRONIC AND ACUTE SICKNESS AND EVEN DEATH. BECAUSE OF THESE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY CURRENTLY REGULATES PM10 AS PART OF THE NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS (NAAQS). MANY DUST?GENERATING AREAS ARE NEAR POPULATION CENTERS, SUCH AS PHOENIX, SALT LAKE CITY,AND CITIES IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. IN THESE AREAS, HIGH PM10 CONCENTRATIONS HAVE LED TO CHRONIC PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE POTENTIAL DUST?GENERATING AREAS PAIRED WITH THE LONG DISTANCES PM10 CAN TRAVEL, IDENTIFYING AREAS THAT CONTRIBUTE DEGRADING THE PUBLIC HEALTH IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM.AS A MEANS OF IDENTIFYING DUST?GENERATING AREAS, WE PROPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WIND EROSION QUANTIFICATION SENSOR (WEQS), WHICH WILL MEASURE HORIZONTAL SOIL PARTICLE MOTION. MOVING SOIL PARTICLES ARE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF DUST AND PM10 GENERATION; THEREFORE, MEASURING SOIL PARTICLE MOTION PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT MEANS OF ASSESSING DUST GENERATION POTENTIAL. CURRENT METHODS TO MEASURE PARTICLE MOTION ARE EXPENSIVE, DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN, AND/OR REQUIRE SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE. TO DEVELOP THE WEQS, WE WILL BE STARTING WITH A KNOWN SOIL PARTICLE COLLECTION DEVICE, THE COX SAND CATCHER. AS SOIL PARTICLES ARE COLLECTED, THEY WILL BE DETECTED WITH A LASER?DIODE DEVICE THAT WILL DETECT INTERRUPTIONS IN THE LIGHT PATH. AN INTEGRATED WEIGHING DEVICE WILL WORK WITH THE LASER?DIODE DEVICE TO MEASURE THE SAND MOTION. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE STORED AND PROCESSED ON SITE USING A MICROPROCESSOR AND THEN TRANSMITTED TO A CLOUD STORAGE PLATFORM FOR NEAR?REAL?TIME DATA DISPLAY. THE ONSITE DATA PROCESSING AND DATA TRANSMISSION WILL ALLOW FOR THE DEVICES TO BE AUTONOMOUS AND CAPABLE OF BEING DEPLOYED TO REMOTE LOCATIONS. THE SIMPLICITY OF THE WEQS WILL MAKE IT AFFORDABLE AND EASY TO DEPLOY SO THAT A VARIETY OF LANDOWNERS (E.G., FEDERAL LAND MANAGERS, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, OR RANCHERS) CAN PURCHASE AND USE THESE TO IDENTIFY DUST GENERATING AREAS ON THEIR LAND. ONCE IDENTIFIED, THE DUST?GENERATING AREAS CAN BE TARGETED FOR MITIGATION, THEREBY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DUST AND PM10 GENERATED. BECAUSE OF THE EASY?DEPLOYMENT, DATA ACCESSIBILITY, AND AFFORDABILITY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WEQS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A USEFUL TOOL IN ONGOING PROGRAMS TO REDUCE THE EXTENT OF WIND-BLOWN SOIL EROSION, AND ITS ASSOCIATED HIGH PM10 CONCENTRATIONS, ACROSS THE ARID LANDS OF THE WESTERN US.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "a33953dc-3b4c-b4d8-aaca-a081af3701a4-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20203361031518_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 97800320, "Award ID": "20203361031517", "Award Amount": 100000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-05-13", "CFDA Number": "10.212", "Description": "NOVEL SYSTEM TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION FROM POULTRY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bc22aa27-9417-cfea-2afb-789cf5280d1c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20203361031517_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 111064368, "Award ID": "20203353033229", "Award Amount": 600000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-21", "CFDA Number": "10.212", "Description": "SUMMARY OF PHASE II EFFORT:BY THE END OF THE PHASE II EFFORT, WE WILL HAVE ESTABLISHED A NOVEL PLATFORM FOR ROUTINE FIELD TESTING OF ARBITRARY WATER SAMPLES FOR DICAMBA.

BECAUSE THE SUBSTANCES APPEARING IN SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS POTENTIALLY TAINTED WITH AN INFECTIOUS ORGANISMDO NOTALWAYS APPEAR IN ABUNDANT CONCENTRATIONS.CONSEQUENTLY, SOME SAMPLES WILL PRESENT AS &#39;BORDERLINE POSITIVE&#39; REQUIRING THE JUDGMENT OF AN UN- OR UNDER-TRAINED INDIVIDUAL IN JUDGING WHETHER THE SAMPLE SHOULD BE DECLARED POSITIVE OR NOT.WITH THE EXPERIENCE LEADING A R&AMP;D GROUP AT DUPONT DEVELOPING HIV/AIDS TEST IN THE 1980&#39;S WHEN AIDS WAS NEARLY 100% FATAL, THIS PROJECT&#39;S PI HAS FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE THAT INTERPRETING SUBJECTIVELY READ DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AS DECLARED POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE DEPENDS ON MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING:SCRUTINY OF THE INDIVIDUAL READING THE TEST DEVICE,THE CLARITY OF THE LIGHTING (ARTIFICIAL VERSUS NATURAL) WHEN VIEWING THE TEST AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,THE CONCENTRATION OF THE SUBSTANCE TO BE DETECTED (IN THIS PROJECT, CORONAVIRUS ANTIGEN) ON THE TEST DEVICE.SUBJECTIVITY CAN BE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED BY USING A DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM THAT USES A METER...AN INSTRUMENT WITH A PRECISELY DEFINED, INVARIANT CUTOFF BETWEEN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SAMPLES.THIS IS INHERENT IN THE APOLLODX DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM FOR ALL OF ITS ASSAYS INCLUDING THIS PROJECT&#39;S CORONAVIRUS ANTIGEN ASSAY.INTEGRATED CONTACT TRACING GATEWAY.APOLLODX SYSTEM&#39;S OPERATION IS SUPER SIMPLE: THE POTENTIOSTAT IS A SLAVE TO THE OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE SMART DEVICE.ONCE THE TEST STRIP CONTAINING TEST SAMPLE IS INSERTED INTO THE POTENTIOSTAT AND THE ELECTROCHEMICAL INTERROGATION OF THAT TEST STRIP IS COMPLETED, THE RESULTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY RELAYED TO THE SMART DEVICE.ONCE RESIDENT ON THE SMART DEVICE, THESE TEST RESULTS AND ALL DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION IDENTIFYING THE TEST SAMPLE ARE RELAYED TO A REMOTE SERVERWITHIN LOCAL AND/OR NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL WHO PROVIDED THE SAMPLE TO IMPLEMENT CONTACT TRACINGIN REAL TIME.BECAUSE ALL INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE COMBATTED WITH THE THREE-PRONGED APPROACH OF &#39;TEST-QUARANTINE-CONTACT TRACE&#39;, THE APOLLODX SYSTEM IS INSTRUMENTALLY IMPORTANT IN ENABLING TWO OUT OF THE THREE OF THESE TO COMBAT THIS PERVASIVE PANDEMIC.IN THIS PHASE I PROJECT, APOLLODX WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING ITS DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM TO DETECT CORONAVIRUS ANTIGEN. APOLLODX WILL INTEGRATE A TECHNIQUE THAT ONE OF ITS CONSULTANTS USED TO DETECT ANOTHER VIRUS WITH THE PUBLISHED CLAIM THAT THE TECHNIQUE WAS AT LEAST EQUAL IN SENSITIVITY TO PCR. THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE PCR IS WIDELY ACCEPTED AS THE PRESUMED STATE-OF-THE-ART IN TERMS OF SENSITIVITY AND IS THE TECHNOLOGY USED IN COMMERCIAL LABS TO DIAGNOSE CORONAVIRUS INFECTION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC.THE KEY DIFFERENCE IN COMBINING APOLLODX&#39;S TEST SYSTEM WITH THIS SPECIAL TECHNIQUE IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT FOR CONTROLLING THE PANDEMIC FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE IN APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES,AT THE POINT OF SAMPLE ACQUISITION; NO TRANSPORTATION OF SAMPLES REQUIREDAPOLLODX&#39;S DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM IS INEXPENSIVE AND SIMPLE ENOUGH (LIKE A GLUCOSE TEST SYSTEM THAT TESTS FOR CORONAVIRUS) THAT IT CAN BE USED BY INDIVIDUALS IN MANY SETTINGS WITH MINIMAL TRAININGTHE SYSTEM PROVIDES A GATEWAY TO CONTACT TRACINGAPOLLODX BELIEVES THAT FOR THESE REASONS AND THE PRELIMINARY DATA PREDICTING SUCCESS OF THIS APPROACH THAT THE COMPANY&#39;S DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM CAN AND WILL MEANINGFULLY CONTRIBUTE TO CONTROLLING THE PANDEMIC STARTING IN FACILITIES IN GREAT NEED FOR RAPID ANSWERS: THIS COUNTRY&#39;S MEAT PACKING FACILITIES AND BEYOND, IN MANY RURAL SETTINGS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "50cc605a-6434-ab94-a1af-2f769a847d07-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20203353032917_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 110209927, "Award ID": "20203353032759", "Award Amount": 649970.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-15", "CFDA Number": "10.212", "Description": "THE GOAL OF PECOS WIND POWER&#39;S USDA SBIR PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT INCREASING CAPACITY FACTOR OF SMALL-SCALE DISTRIBUTED WIND TURBINES IS A TECHNICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE SOLUTION TO PROVIDING LOWER COST ELECTRICITY TO RURAL AREAS NATIONWIDE.

NITRIC ACID (HNO3), WHICH IS THE PROTONATED NITRATE ION, IS PRIMARILY USED BY THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY TO MAKE GRANULAR AMMONIUM NITRATE OR UREA AMMONIUM NITRATE (UAN) SOLUTIONS. THE CONVENTIONAL INDUSTRIAL APPROACH FIRST PRODUCES AMMONIA (NH3) FROM NITROGEN (N2) USING NATURAL GAS (CH4) RESOURCES THROUGH THE HABER PROCESS. AMMONIA IS THEN BURNED USING OXYGEN (O2) FROM AIR TO PRODUCE NITRIC ACID THROUGH THE OSTWALD PROCESS. THESE TWO PROCESSES ARE SO ENERGY INTENSIVE THAT WORLDWIDE AMMONIA AND NITRIC ACID PRODUCTION BY THE HABER AND OSTWALD PROCESSES, RESPECTIVELY, CONSUMES 1 - 2 % OF GLOBAL ENERGY GENERATION AND PRODUCES ABOUT 3 % OF GLOBAL ANTHROPOGENIC CO2 EMISSIONS. THE DIRECT OXIDATION OF NITROGEN TO NITRIC ACID USING AIR AND STEAM (H2O), HOWEVER, COULD USE AS LITTLE AS A TENTH OF THE ENERGY COMPARED TO THE HABER-OSTWALD PROCESSES. LUNA IS THEREFORE DEVELOPING A DUAL PHASE CATALYTIC MEMBRANE REACTOR TO DIRECTLY OXIDIZE NITROGEN TO NITRIC ACID THROUGH THE LUNOX PROCESS. THE SEPARATION OF GASEOUS REACTANTS AND PRODUCTS WITH THE LUNOX MEMBRANE IS THE KEY TO THERMODYNAMICALLY ACHIEVING NITRIC ACID PRODUCTION. THE DRAMATIC POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN ENERGY REQUIREMENTS BY THE LUNOX PROCESS ARE EXPECTED TO ENABLE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN NITRATE PRODUCTION COSTS.THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THE MULTI-PHASE SBIR PROGRAM IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERS BOTH THE PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS OF NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS TO FARMERS. TRANSPORTATION TYPICALLY REPRESENTS 10 - 30 % OF NITROGENOUS FERTILIZER COSTS, DEPENDING ON DISTANCE FROM PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR AMMONIA PIPELINE TERMINALS. THE LUNOX PROCESS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER TRANSPORTATION COSTS BY ENABLING THE TRANSITION FROM NITRIC ACID PRODUCTION FROM AMMONIA PRODUCTION FACILITIES TO PRODUCTION AT AMMONIA PIPELINE TERMINALS. THE USE OF MORE LOCAL ENERGY RESOURCES TO PRODUCE NITRIC ACID WOULD SUPPORT MORE EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF INTERMITTENT RENEWABLE ENERGY (WIND, SOLAR) RESOURCES WITH FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS. IDEALLY, THE STEAM AND HEAT OF HEAT RECOVERY STEAM GENERATORS (HRSG) AND BOILERS OF FOSSIL FLUE POWER PLANTS WOULD POWER THE LUNOX PROCESS ON DEMAND WHILE INTERMITTENT RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES SUPPLY ELECTRICITY TO THE GRID. ALTOGETHER, THE LUNOX PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO ENHANCE AGRICULTURAL PROFITABILITY BY LOWERING ENERGY COSTS BY 70 - 90 %, FEEDSTOCK/FERTILIZER TRANSPORTATION COSTS BY 30 - 50 %, AND THE OVERALL COSTS OF PRODUCING CORN AND SOY CROPS BY 1 - 2 %.THE OVERALL GOALS OF THE PROPOSED PHASE II PROGRAM ARE TO SCALE UP THE MEMBRANE REACTOR TECHNOLOGY INTO A REPRESENTATIVE PROTOTYPE MODULE AND DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL FOR COMMERCIAL NITRIC ACID PRODUCTION. THE TECHNICAL EFFORT IS DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT THE MEMBRANES CAN PRACTICALLY FUNCTION AS INTENDED BY REFINING THE MEMBRANE MATERIAL COMPOSITIONS FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND STABILITY, ADVANCING THE MEMBRANE MANUFACTURING AND TESTING CAPABILITIES TO SCALE UP THE LUNOX PROCESS BY A FACTOR OF &GT;100&TIMES;, AND EVALUATING THE SCALED UP PROCESS PERFORMANCE IN RELEVANT OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS. THIS TECHNICAL EFFORT PREPARES THE LUNOX PROCESS FOR TECHNO-ECONOMIC EVALUATION TO QUANTITATIVELY ESTIMATE THE PROFITABILITY OF LUNA&#39;S PROPOSED NITRIC ACID PRODUCTION PROCESS.

EACH YEAR, AN ESTIMATED 15-30% OF THE U.S. POTATO CROP IS LOST TO SOFT ROT, REPRESENTING A MARKET LOSS OF $0.57B-$1.13B. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AVAILABLE FOR THIS DISEASE. OUR SOLUTION IS A BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT THAT USES THE PREDATORY POWER OF DICTYOSTELIDS (\"DICTY\" FOR SHORT) INSTEAD OF HARSH CHEMICALS. DICTY ARE MICROSCOPIC ORGANISMS THAT LIVE IN THE SOIL WHERE THEY FEED SELECTIVELY ON BACTERIA. AMEBAGONE HAS ACCESS TO OVER 3,000 DICTY STRAINS FROM DIVERSE GEOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATIC REGIONS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED DICTY STRAINS THAT FEED ON BACTERIA THAT CAUSE POTATO SOFT ROT: DICKEYA AND PECTOBACTERIUM. STRAINS CAPABLE OF FEEDING ON DICKEYA AND PECTOBACTERIUM ON POTATOES AT COOL TEMPERATURES RELEVANT TO STORAGE CONDITIONS (~50&DEG;F) HAVE ALSO BEEN DISCOVERED. THREE STRAINS IDENTIFIED DURING PHASE I RESEARCH ARE EVEN CAPABLE OF REDUCING SOFT ROT SEVERITY IN WHOLE TUBERS. CONVENIENTLY, DICTY PRODUCE LARGE NUMBERS OF SEMI-DORMANT SPORES THAT ARE HIGHLY RESISTANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS AND LONG-TERM STORAGE. SPORE GERMINATION RELEASES METABOLICALLY ACTIVE DICTY CELLS THAT IMMEDIATELY BEGIN FEEDING ON SURROUNDING BACTERIA.

ACCORDING TO A SUMMARY OF SUPPRESSION COSTS COMPILED BY THE NATIONAL INTERAGENCY FIRE CENTER (NIFC) FOR 2017 ALONE, THERE WERE MORE THAN 71,000 WILDFIRES, IMPACTING OVER 10 MILLION ACRES, AND RESULTING IN ALMOST 3 BILLION DOLLARS IN EXPENDITURES ACROSS ALL AGENCIES. ON A MORE PERSONAL NOTE, BETWEEN 1990 AND 2015, AN AVERAGE OF 17 FIREFIGHTER LIVES WERE LOST DURING FIRE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS; TWENTY-ONE PERCENT OF THOSE DEATHS WERE DUE TO ENTRAPMENT. FURTHER, ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM WILDFIRE TODAY, PRIMARY CONCERNS FROM THE FIREFIGHTING COMMUNITY RELATED TO FATALITIES INCLUDE A LACK OF TACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF ESCAPE ROUTES AND SAFETY ZONES (THE \"BLACK\"), AND REAL-TIME DATA FOR DECISION MAKERS. AUTHOR (AND VETERAN FIREFIGHTER) BILL GABBERT BELIEVES OPERATIONALLY RELEVANT, REAL-TIME DATA AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR DECISION MAKERS AND GROUND SUPERVISORS ARE KEYS TO EFFECTIVE CHANGE:\"UTILIZE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ENABLE DIVISION SUPERVISORS, OPERATIONS SECTION CHIEFS, AND SAFETY OFFICERS TO KNOW IN REAL TIME, 1) WHERE THE FIRE IS, AND 2) WHERE THE FIREFIGHTERS ARE...LAST MONTH TOM HARBOUR TOLD ME THAT HE WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, SOMEONE IN WASHINGTON WOULD BE ACCESSING THE DATA FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY AND ORDER THAT A FIREFIGHTER MOVE 20 FEET TO THE LEFT. THAT CAN BE MANAGED. MAKING THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO SUPERVISORS ON THE GROUND CAN SAVE LIVES.\"THE GOAL OF THE PHASE II EFFORT IS TO DEVELOP TO PROTOTYPE AND DEMONSTRATE THE PROCESSING, EXPLOITATION, AND DISSEMINATION (PED) SOLUTION PROPOSED DURING PHASE I. THE SOLUTION IS COMPRISED OF A FIXED WING SMALL UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM (SUAS), AN ASSET TRACKING SYSTEM (ATS), AN SUAS MOUNTED OPTICAL AND INFRARED VIDEO SENSOR, A GROUND CONTROL STATION (GCS), AND A SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT FOR RECEIPT, STORAGE, VISUALIZATION AND FUSION OF RELEVANT IMAGERY, MAPS, ATS DATA, AND GEOSPATIAL DATA. THE PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM IS TO ENHANCE REAL-TIME SITUATIONAL AWARENESS, MAXIMIZE RESOURCE ALLOCATION, AND REDUCE RISK TO FIREFIGHTERS BY INJECTING OPERATIONALLY RELEVANT DATA INTO THE COMMON OPERATING PICTURE (COP) OF INCIDENT LEADERSHIP WHILE FIREFIGHTERS ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING FOREST WILDFIRES. THE OVERALL PED ARCHITECTURE IS SCALABLE, AND CAN BE REPLICATED MULTIPLE TIMES, SO THAT MULTIPLE PED SYSTEMS CAN BE DEPLOYED TO SUPPORT SEPARATE EVENTS OR INTERCONNECTED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MANAGE ONE LARGE-SCALE EVENT. THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY DEVELOPING A DEMONSTRATION WORTHY PROTOTYPE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION AND BY WORKING WITH ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THE WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY TO DEVELOP DOCTRINES FOR SYSTEM EMPLOYMENT. BASED UPON REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH BY THE COMMUNITY DURING PHASE I SKYWARD WILL ALSO FACILITATE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY AND THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) TO CREATE APPROPRIATE RULES AND MEANS SUPPORTING THE USE OF SUAS TO COMBAT WILDFIRES.

FOOD INDUSTRY: MEALWORM PROTEIN INGREDIENT AS EXTRACT AND POWDERTHE GOAL OF THIS SBIR EFFORT IS TO CONTRIBUTE VALUE AND INGREDIENT DIVERSITY TO THE FOOD INDUSTRY. THE INSECT BASED FOOD MARKET IS CURRENTLY VALUED AT $105M AND IS GROWING TO $1.53 BILLION BY 2021. TO DATE ONLY WHOLE INSECT POWDERS, NOT FRACTIONATED OR EXTRACTED PROTEIN PRODUCTS MADE FROM INSECTS, ARE OFFERED BY COMPANIES. CRICKETS HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE MARKET. TO BECOME COMPETITIVE IN THE LARGER PROTEIN MARKET, THE INSECT BASED FOOD INDUSTRY MUST INNOVATE AND DIVERSIFY. MEALWORMS HAVE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OVER CRICKETS. THEY TEND TO BE MORE DISEASE RESISTANT, CAN BE PRODUCED IN SMALLER SPACES AT HIGHER DENSITY AND MAY BE MORE AMENABLE TO MECHANIZED AUTOMATED FARMING. ADDITIONALLY, DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING PROTEIN EXTRACTS MADE FROM MEALWORMS AND CRICKETS WILL AID FOOD COMPANIES IN THEIR GOAL TO ADD HIGHER LEVELS OF INSECT PROTEIN TO PRODUCTS WITHOUT ADDING FAT CALORIESOR NEGATIVELY AFFECTING PRODUCT QUALITY.AS THE HUMAN POPULATION GROWS, IT IS EVER MORE IMPORTANT TO SUSTAIN RATHER THAN INCREASE LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION FROM EARTH AND IT&#39;S ECOSPHERE. CURRENT SOURCES OF PROTEIN ARE UNSUSTAINABLE. ALREADY 70% OF AGRICULTURAL LAND, 30% OF THE LAND ON EARTH, IS USED FOR LIVESTOCK. DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR FOOD SUPPLY IS CRITICAL FOR FOOD SECURITY. THE GOOD NEWS IS FARMING INSECTS, IE. MEALWORMS (YELLOW MEALWORM, TENEBRIO MOLITOR), HOLDS PROMISE AS A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION. THEY UTILIZE LESS ENERGY, FEED, LAND AND WATER THAN OTHER LIVESTOCK, CONTRIBUTING LESS TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLLUTION. INDEED, INSECTS ARE GAINING MOMENTUM AS A FOOD INGREDIENT. STARTING 2011-2013, OVER 30 COMPANIES IN NORTH AMERICA, 50 IN EUROPE, OFFER FOOD PRODUCTS WITH INSECTS AS A KEY INGREDIENT. IN FACT, ALL THINGS BUGS LLC HAS LED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRICKETS AS A PROTEIN SOURCE, SELLING OVER 15,000 POUNDS OF ITS GRIOPRO&REG; CRICKET POWDER. HOWEVER, THE FOOD INDUSTRY HAS A BIG DEMAND FOR ADDING MORE PROTEIN TO PRODUCTS WITHOUT ADDING CALORIES OR CHANGING THE TEXTURE, FLAVOR AND AROMA. OUR PHASE I RESEARCH HAS SHOWN FATS, OILS AND OTHER COMPONENTS IN WHOLE INSECT POWDERS LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PROTEIN THAT CAN BE ADDED WITHOUT NEGATIVELY AFFECTING PRODUCT. THUS, THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE II IS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE MEALWORM POWDER AND INSECT PROTEIN EXTRACTS AS VIABLE INGREDIENTS FOR THE FOOD INDUSTRY. WITH THESE FUNDS WE WILL DEVELOP AN INSECT PROTEIN EXTRACT AND PRODUCTION METHODOLOGY AND EVALUATE IT ALONG SIDE WHOLE MEALWORM AND CRICKET POWDERS BASED ON: 1) SHELF LIFE, 2) SAFETY, 3) NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND 4) PERFORMANCE AND FUNCTIONALITY AS INGREDIENTS IN MAINSTREAM STAPLE FOOD PRODUCTS.

HVACP-BASED NTP PROVIDES ENHANCED FOOD SAFETY BY REDUCING INCIDENCES OF FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS. IT IS A COST-EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY THAT ADDRESSES SEVERAL NIFA NATIONAL CHALLENGE AREAS. THESE INCLUDE: 1) GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND HUNGER ALLEVIATION BY INCREASED PROTECTION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FROM DISEASE AND PESTS AND REDUCED FOOD LOSSES; 2) LOW TO NO IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE BY PROVIDING AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, LOW ENERGY AND LOW CARBON FOOTPRINT ALTERNATIVE TO CHEMICAL AND THERMAL PROCESSES; AND 3) FOOD SAFETY BY REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF FOOD-BORNE ILLNESSES AND DEATH THROUGH AN IMPROVED FOOD PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY. INDUSTRY ADOPTION OF THIS NOVEL NTP TECHNOLOGY WILL PROVIDE HIGHER QUALITY ALMONDS, OTHER TREENUTS AND PEANUTS TO THE CONSUMERS AND INCREASE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR U.S. ALMONDS AND OTHER TREE NUTS.ATMOSPHERIC COLD PLASMA IS A NATURAL PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN HARNESSED AND ADAPTED FOR INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES. THE FIRST ATMOSPHERIC, LOW TEMPERATURE PLASMA WAS INVENTED BY WERNER VON SIEMENS IN 1857 (SIEMENS, 1857). AIR WAS PASSED BETWEEN TWO PARALLEL PLATES CONTAINING AN ELECTRICAL SPARK (CORONA DISCHARGE) TO GENERATE OZONE. PLASMA CAN BE GENERATED IN ANY GAS ENVIRONMENTS (E.G. AIR, O2, HE, N2, AR, NE, CO2) WITH EITHER DC OR AC CURRENT (ROTH, 1995). HVACP CAPITALIZES ON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES AND THE PHYSICS OF ELECTRIC FIELD. WHEN A GAS IS SUBJECTED TO A VOLTAGE GRADIENT OF ADEQUATE STRENGTH; ELECTRONS CAN BE STRIPPED FROM THE GAS MOLECULES (IONIZATION). THESE ELECTRONS REACT WITH THE BULK GAS GENERATING LIGHT, UV, AND UNIQUE REACTIVE GAS SPECIES (OZONE, OXIDES OF NITROGEN, PEROXIDES, ATOMIC OXYGEN, ETC.), MANY OF WHICH CAN ALTER MYCOTOXINS ON THE SURFACE OF ALMONDS, OTHER TREENUTS, PEANUTS AS WELL AS ON MAIZE, WHEAT ETC. AND RENDER MYCOTOXINS NON-TOXIC. IN THE 2017 USDA-NIFA-SBIR-005943 PHASE I GRANT, NANOGUARD DEMONSTRATED THAT A NON-THERMAL PROCESSING USING HVACP CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE AFLATOXINS ON ALMONDS WITHOUT IMPACTING QUALITY. NANOGUARD HAS ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT THE REACTIVE GAS SPECIES (RGS) IN HVACP HAVE EXCELLENT BACTERICIDAL PROPERTIES AND THEY COULD THEREFORE INACTIVATE BACTERIA, FUNGI AND MOLD ON TREE NUTS, PEANUTS, CORN, ETC. AS AN ADDED BENEFIT.MYCOTOXINS ARE SECONDARY METABOLITES PRODUCED BY SPECIFIC MOLDS AND FUNGI THAT ARE TOXIC TO HUMANS AND LIVESTOCK AT LOW PART PER BILLION (PPB) LEVELS (PANKAJ ET AL., 2018; SARANGAPANI ET AL., 2018; SHI ET AL.,2017; BOURKE ET AL., 2017;). THESE MYCOTOXINS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A RANGE OF HEALTH ISSUES THAT HAVE TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC IMPACT IN BOTH THE HUMAN AND ANIMAL NUTRITION INDUSTRIES. THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) HAS ESTIMATED THAT 25% OF THE WORLD&#39;S CROPS ARE AFFECTED BY MYCOTOXINS EACH YEAR, WITH ANNUAL LOSSES OF AROUND ONE BILLION METRIC TONS OF FOOD AND FOOD PRODUCTS. ECONOMIC LOSSES OCCUR BECAUSE OF: 1) YIELD LOSS DUE TO DISEASES INDUCED BY TOXIGENIC FUNGI; 2) REDUCED CROP VALUE RESULTING FROM MYCOTOXIN CONTAMINATION; 3) LOSSES IN ANIMAL PRODUCTIVITY FROM MYCOTOXIN-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS; AND 4) HUMAN HEALTH COSTS. ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MYCOTOXINS INCLUDE THE COST OF MANAGEMENT AT ALL LEVELS - PREVENTION, SAMPLING, ANALYSIS, MITIGATION, LITIGATION, AND RESEARCH COSTS. SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC LOSSES RESULTING FROM MYCOTOXINS ARE WELL DOCUMENTED ALONG THE FOOD AND FEED SUPPLY CHAINS: CROP PRODUCERS, ANIMAL PRODUCERS, DISTRIBUTORS, PROCESSORS, CONSUMERS, AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE (DUE TO HEALTH CARE IMPACTS AND PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES). ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS OF MYCOTOXINS IN THE UNITED STATES VARY: ONE REPORT ESTIMATED $0.5 TO $1.5 BILLION/YEAR (COUNCIL FOR AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 2003) AND ANOTHER ESTIMATED $5 BILLION/YEAR FOR THE U.S. ANDCANADA (WHO/FAO, 2002).THE HIGHEST VALUED TREE NUT CROP IN THE UNITED STATES IS ALMONDS, GENERATING $6.4 BILLION IN 2014 WITH A TOTAL PRODUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 2 BILLION POUNDS (USDA ERS, 2015). THE INITIAL SUBJECTIVE FORECAST FOR THE 2017 CALIFORNIA ALMOND PRODUCTION IS 2.2 BILLION POUNDS (USDA NASS, 2017). MYCOTOXIN CONTAMINATION IN ALMONDS, PRIMARILY AFLATOXINS, IS A CONSTANT CONCERN. AFLATOXINS ARE PRODUCED BY THE FUNGI ASPERGILLUS FLAVUS. GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN TREE NUTS ARE RECOMMENDED FOR PREVENTION OF CONTAMINATION AND GROWTH OF ASPERGILLUS FLAVUS, SUCH AS KEEPING PRODUCT DRY DURING STORAGE. HOWEVER, AFLATOXIN PRODUCTION CAN OCCUR SEASONALLY TO VARYING DEGREES AND IS MOST PROBLEMATIC UNDER WET HARVESTING CONDITIONS OR PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN WHEN AIR HUMIDITY IS HIGH, LEADING TO FAVORABLE GROWTH CONDITIONS. THE TREE NUT AS WELL AS THE PEANUT INDUSTRIES ARE LOOKING FOR A SIMPLE, COST EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SOLUTION FOR REDUCING MYCOTOXINS ON NUTS WITHOUTCOMPROMISING PRODUCT INTEGRITY. NANOGUARD&#39;S HVACP-BASED NON-THERMAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY IS A PERFECT SOLUTION TO MITIGATE THE POST-HARVEST MYCOTOXIN PROBLEM FACING THE ALMOND INDUSTRY, IN PARTICULAR, AND TREE NUT AS WELL AS PEANUT INDUSTRY IN GENERAL.THERE IS AN INCREASING GLOBAL DEMAND FOR FOOD THAT IS FRESH, FREE OF PATHOGENS AND TOXINS, AND HAS LONGER SHELF-LIFE. CONSUMER ATTENTION TO NUTRITION, ESPECIALLY AWARENESS AND CONCERNS OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF PRESERVATIVES AND ADDITIVES DURING PROCESSING, IS ALSO FUELING DEMAND FOR MINIMALLY PROCESSED FOOD THAT IS SAFE BUT RETAINS HIGH NUTRITIONAL VALUE, TEXTURE, AND FLAVOR. THE RECENT REPORTS ON MICROBIAL CONTAMINATED FOOD HAS SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED CONSUMER AWARENESS ON FOOD SAFETY. BECAUSE NON-THERMAL PROCESSING THROUGH HVACP REDUCES MYCOTOXINS AND MICROORGANISMS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, IT MUST BE OF PUBLIC INTEREST TO BRING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO COMMERCIALIZATION. HVACP-BASED NON-THERMAL PROCESSING ASSURES GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND REDUCE HUNGER BY INCREASED PROTECTION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FROM DISEASE AND PESTS AND REDUCED FOOD LOSSES. THIS POST-HARVEST PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY IS COST-EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, AND IT WILL PROMOTE THE EXPORT OF U.S. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, BRINGING PROSPERITY TO FARMERS AND GROWERS. WITH THE HELP OF THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY, U.S. TREE NUT GROWERS AND EXPORTERS CAN STAY COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL MARKET PLACE BY REDUCING THE LOSSES FROM AFLATOXIN CONTAMINATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "36aa956c-023b-f6a1-f3dc-79abd3dc0a03-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20183361028949_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 69573235, "Award ID": "20183361028948", "Award Amount": 599968.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-09-17", "CFDA Number": "10.212", "Description": "ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) IN 2011, APPROXIMATELY 48 MILLION AMERICANS GET SICK, 128,000 ARE HOSPITALIZED AND 3,000 DIE EACH YEAR FROM FOOD POISONING, ALSO KNOWN AS FOODBORNE ILLNESS.

UNDESIRABLE ORGANISMS ALSO GROW IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING DISEASE-CAUSING MICROBIAL PLANT PATHOGENS AND SLIMY MICROBIAL BIOFILM ORGANISMS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE AND CAN CAUSE WORKER HAZARDS. GROWERS NEED A UNIVERSALLY EFFECTIVE ANTIMICROBIAL DISINFECTANT THAT CAN BE USED AGAINST UNDESIRABLE MICROBES IN A GREENHOUSE ENVIRONMENT AND PREVENT THEIR SPREAD.GREENHOUSE OPERATIONS, ON AVERAGE, HAVE FEWER ACRES THAN OUTDOOR GROWING BUT MUCH HIGHER SALES PER ACRE. WITHIN THESE ENCLOSED GREENHOUSES RE-OCCURRING PLANT PATHOGEN DISEASES AND OTHER UNWANTED MICROBES CAN BE EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC; INFECTIOUS MICROBES AND ALGAE READILY ACCUMULATE ON MOIST SURFACES. DISEASE WITHIN A GREENHOUSE CAN BE A KEY LIMITATION TO PROFITABLE PLANT PRODUCTION. ONCE INTRODUCED, PATHOGEN POPULATIONS WITHIN A GREENHOUSE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS LONG AS THERE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE PLANT TISSUES AVAILABLE FOR INFECTION. CLEAN AND DISINFECTED SURFACES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT PATHOGENS ARE NOT CARRIED OVER FROM ONE SEASON TO THE NEXT, OR FROM ONE GROWER TO ANOTHER. SOIL-BORNE PATHOGENS CAN REMAIN DORMANT FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AND ARE CAPABLE OF RE-INFECTING SUSCEPTIBLE PLANT MATERIAL WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.IN THIS EFFORT, TDA RESEARCH, INC.

THE OXIDANT IS GENERATED CONTINUOUSLY ON THE SURFACE, PROVIDING THE ADVANTAGE OF CONTINUED SURFACE DISINFECTION WHERE OTHER PRODUCTS RAPIDLY DECAY AND BECOME INEFFECTIVE.
