THIS RESULTED IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF ETHYLENE OXIDE AS A POTENTIAL HEALTH CONCERN IN SEVERAL AREAS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN THE STATE OF UTAH.

THE FIRST IS A MEDICAL STERILIZATION FACILITY LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE SALT LAKE CITY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. THE OTHER IS A MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURING PLANT LOCATED IN SANDY, UTAH WHO USES ETHYLENE OXIDE TO STERILIZE THE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT IT MANUFACTURES.
