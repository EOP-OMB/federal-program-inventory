GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE MAT-SU REGION IS THE SIZE OF THE ENTIRE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA. COORDINATING SERVICES IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING DUE TO THE RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMY WITH A POPULATION DENSITY OF JUST 4.3 PEOPLE PER SQUARE MILE. WITH 47% OF PRISONERS IN ALASKA HOUSED IN ONE OF THE THREE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN THE MAT-SU REGION AND AN AVERAGE OF 700-800 PRISONERS RELEASED IN THE REGION EACH YEAR, THE NEED FOR REENTRY SERVICES IS CRUCIAL TO OVERCOME BARRIERS, STIGMAS, AND THE CHALLENGES OF A RURAL AREA.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTHE PROPOSED MAT-SU REENTRY PROGRAM THROUGH SECOND CHANCE ACT FY21 FUNDING WILL CONTINUE ON-GOING REGIONAL EFFORTS TO INCREASE AND STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF VALLEY CHARITIES, INC. TO COORDINATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, HOUSING, WORKFORCE, IDENTIFICATION, AND OTHER SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR ADULT PRISONERS RE-JOINING COMMUNITIES IN THE MAT-SU REGION OF ALASKA. STARTING PRE-RELEASE, THE PROGRAM UTILIZES THE LEVEL OF SERVICE INVENTORY-REVISED (LSI-R) TOOL, WHICH DETERMINES AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S RISK LEVEL AND IDENTIFIES THE CRIMINOGENIC NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. THE PROGRAM THEN WORKS WITH THE INDIVIDUALS AFTER THEY HAVE SELF-IDENTIFIED THEIR GOALS FOR POST-RELEASE TO CONNECT THEM WITH SERVICES WHO PROVIDE STABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY DURING CRITICALLY VULNERABLE 30-DAY POST-RELEASE PERIODS. FOLLOW-UP CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING YEAR THROUGH COORDINATED CARE. THIS LEVEL OF COORDINATION OF SERVICES FURTHERS THE VISION AND GOAL OF THE PROGRAM TO INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY AND ASSURE A REENTRANTS POSITIVE TRANSITION INTO THE COMMUNITY.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nINCREASED CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THE MAT-SU REENTRY PROGRAM THROUGH THE FY21 SECOND CHANCE ACT WILL INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM RATES IN ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING REGIONS OF ALASKA. FROM THIS PROJECT, INCREASED DATA, A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR CONTINUING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MAT-SU REENTRY PROGRAM, AND INCREASED UNDERSTANDING THROUGH A WRITTEN ANALYSIS AND REPORT AT THE END OF THE PROJECT WILL HELP FURTHER PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT WITH POTENTIAL PROGRAM REPLICATION IN OTHER REGIONALLY-BASED REENTRY COALITIONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AK", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4fb92845-8d9d-2f4a-8875-2bf07fb53f22-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJA21GG02842SCAX_1550"}, {"internal_id": 156905265, "Award ID": "15PBJA21GG02797SMTP", "Award Amount": 714808.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-12-03", "CFDA Number": "16.812", "Description": "TARGET #S ADJUSTED DUE TO LIMITED TIME REMAINING IN YEAR 1", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6a8d0b8c-a3c8-ee04-3d8e-b495cd05e580-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJA21GG02797SMTP_1550"}, {"internal_id": 146120390, "Award ID": "15PBJA21GG02796SMTP", "Award Amount": 538503.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-12-03", "CFDA Number": "16.812", "Description": "INTEGRATING NOVEL TECHNOLOGY FOR OPTIMIZED SUPERVISION RESPONSIVITY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1b9f0dcd-f498-21fb-7cc3-55d4d64182a4-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJA21GG02796SMTP_1550"}, {"internal_id": 146120600, "Award ID": "15PBJA21GG02795SMTP", "Award Amount": 715000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-12-03", "CFDA Number": "16.812", "Description": "IMPROVEMENTS TO OFFENDER VIOLATION GUIDE AND DASHBOARDS IN ARKANSAS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "059f2ce0-5101-463e-05fa-6c76056a795d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJA21GG02795SMTP_1550"}, {"internal_id": 146121328, "Award ID": "15PBJA21GG02794SMTP", "Award Amount": 714908.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-12-03", "CFDA Number": "16.812", "Description": "HIDALGO COUNTY VIRTUAL SUPERVISION CASELOAD", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0f01909b-d89f-a85f-82c0-29dc8bdef90b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJA21GG02794SMTP_1550"}, {"internal_id": 156905264, "Award ID": "15PBJA21GG02793SMTP", "Award Amount": 713738.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-12-03", "CFDA Number": "16.812", "Description": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\n\nNAME OF LEAD APPLICANT: MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS (MDOC)\n\nAMOUNT REQUESTED: $713,738\n\nOJP POLICY PRIORITY AREAS: THIS PROGRAM WILL ADDRESS A SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES IN RURAL COUNTIES, HIGH AND PERSISTENT-POVERTY COUNTIES, AND QUALIFIED OPPORTUNITY ZONES\n\nSERVICE AREA: MDOC DIVISION OF PROBATION AND PAROLE (P&P) EASTERN, SOUTHEAST, AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS\n\nPROJECT SUMMARY:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nIN 2018, MDOC BEGAN THE JUSTICE REINVESTMENT INITIATIVE TREATMENT PILOT (JRITP), NOW KNOWN AS IMPROVING COMMUNITY TREATMENT SUCCESS (ICTS).
