IVANHOE AND THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS, WHICH ARE DESIGNATED A FOOD DESERT BY THE USDA, EXPERIENCE HEALTHY FOOD APARTHEID AND ARE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS AGRICULTURAL MARKETS BY LIMITED TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC BARRIERS. HERE, THE AVERAGE INCOME AND COLLEGE EDUCATION RATES ARE 40 PERCENT BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. CHRONIC DISEASE CAUSED BY OBESITY FROM POOR NUTRITION PREDOMINATE IN THE POPULATION. CRIME HOTSPOTS SURROUND THE AREA. WHILE STATISTICS ARE GRIM, THE IVANHOE NEIGHBORHOOD&#39;S ACTIONS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS HAVE PROVEN THAT PEOPLE CAN FEEL BETTER, LIVE BETTER, AND HELP EACH OTHER, THROUGH FOOD, FARMING AND NUTRITION. THIS NIFA-FUNDED PROJECT WILL BUILD ON POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN THE IVANHOE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT WILL EXPAND SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, ADD FOOD ENTREPRENEURSHIP CLASSES, SUPPORT LAUNCH OF ADDITIONAL URBAN FARMS TO SUPPLY FRESH FOOD, EXPAND THE IVANHOE FARMERS MARKET, AND WITH A GRANT FROM THE CITY OF KANSAS CITY, MO., UPGRADE THE IVANHOE FARM-TO-TABLE SHARED-USE KITCHEN TO FULL COMMERCIAL STATUS FOR PROFESSIONAL FOOD PROCESSING. THE LOCUS OF ACTIVITY IS THE IVANHOE FARM-TO-TABLE KITCHEN AT LINWOOD AREA MINISTRY PLACE (LAMP), A SOCIAL-PURPOSE NONPROFIT CAMPUS CREATED BY COMMUNITY DEVELOPER, LINWOOD PROPERTY, INC.WHILE THE IVANHOE NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LAMP, HAS CREATED, TESTED, AND PROVEN A COMBINATION OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE IMPROVING RESIDENTS&#39; WELLBEING, IVANHOE STANDS ALONE IN PROMOTING AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO FRESH, LOCAL FOOD IN EASTERN KANSAS CITY, WHICH HAS ENDURED INTERGENERATIONAL DISENFRANCHISEMENT THAT RESULTED FROM RED LINING IN THE 1930S. MEANWHILE, THE KANSAS CITY AREA HAS AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES IN LOCAL FOOD SYSTEM ASSETS:? THE KANSAS CITY FOOD HUB, LINKING FARM PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS.? CULTIVATE KC, SUPPORTING METRO FARMERS.? NEW GROWTH AND WEST CENTRAL COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY, SUPPORTING REGIONAL FARMERS.? KC HEALTHY KIDS, KC FOOD CIRCLE, PROVIDING INTERNET VISIBILITY TO MORE THAN 40 RESTAURANTS THAT BUY LOCAL FOOD AND 78 LOCAL CSAS.? UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AND KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION LOCAL FOOD SYSTEM SPECIALISTS IN KANSAS CITY (WITH WHICH LAMP HAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP) TO ASSIST WITH FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND FARMING EXPERTISE.? THE ENNOVATION CENTER FOOD BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL KITCHEN CONSULTANCY AND THE K-STATE FOOD INNOVATION ACCELERATOR HELP ASPIRING ENTREPRENEURS START FOOD BUSINESSES.WITHOUT A COMMITTED ENTITY, LIVING AND WORKING WITHIN THE POOREST, MOST MARGINALIZED NEIGHBORHOODS, NONE OF THESE ASSETS CAN TOUCH THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO NEED THEM MOST. LAMP IS THAT COMMITTED ENTITY, AND ON A NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE, LAMP HAS PROVEN IT CAN MEET THE CHALLENGE. THIS PROJECT&#39;S GOAL IS TO LEVERAGE THOSE ASSETS AND SERVE THOUSANDS MORE URBAN CORE RESIDENTS IN THE 64109, 64110, 64127, 64128, AND 64130 ZIP COD,ES.OUR FIRST GOAL IS TO IMPROVE FOOD ACCESS: 1) EXPAND OUR REACH TO CLIENTS OF LAMP&#39;S FOUR RESIDENTNONPROFITS THAT SERVE MORE THAN 6,000 VISITORS ANNUALLY; 2) BUILD A COALITION WITH THE KANSAS CITY FOOD HUB TO BRING WEST-CENTRAL MISSOURI PRODUCE TO LAMP AND CREATE A NEW MARKET FOR THOSE RURAL GROWERS; 3) TEACH RESIDENTS HOW TO ENROLL IN STATE AND REGIONAL FOOD-BUYING VOUCHER PROGRAMS; 4) RECRUIT MORE URBAN FARMERS USING OUR PROPOSED FARM IN A BOX PROGRAM, WHICH TEACHES RESIDENTS HOW TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE, HALF-ACRE AGRIBUSINESSES ON THEIR PROPERTY OR ONE OF THE MANY VACANT LOTS. THE FARM IN A BOX CONCEPT GERMINATED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS WHILE TRAINING ASPIRING FARMERS WITH HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE, SHARED EQUIPMENT, GRANTSMANSHIP COACHING, AND CONTINUAL SUPPORT, WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN NINE PRODUCTIVE IVANHOE FARMS, NOW SELF-NAMED WOODLAND GREENWAY.OUR SECOND GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF 6,000 ADDITIONAL RESIDENTS BY EXPANDING OUR CLASSES IN OUR FARM-TO-TABLE KITCHEN, TEACHING NUTRITION, PURCHASING, PREPARATION, PRESERVATION, AND HOW TO BUY DIRECTLY FROM URBAN/NEIGHBOR FARMERS AND THEIR CSA.OUR THIRD GOAL IS TO DEVELOP OUR NEW COMMERCIAL SHARED-USE KITCHEN INTO A FOOD BUSINESS INCUBATOR THAT TEACHES BUDDING ENTREPRENEURS HOW TO START A FOOD BUSINESS, DEVELOP PRODUCTS, BRAND, PACKAGE, AND MARKET THEM.OUR FOURTH GOAL IS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE FARM-TO-TABLE SHARED USE KITCHEN. A FEASIBILITY STUDY AND BUSINESS PLAN (AN EXCERPT OF WHICH IS ATTACHED AS APPENDICES) DEMONSTRATE THAT THE KITCHEN WILL SUSTAIN ITSELF WITH HOURLY RENTAL BY FOOD BUSINESSES AND CLASS FEES FROM THE PUBLIC. NET INCOME IS EXPECTED TO PAY FOR THE KITCHEN AND MANAGEMENT AND COVER ROUGHLY HALF THE COST OF CLASSES AND PROGRAMMING FOR LOW-INCOME PARTICIPANTS. WHILE OUR INTENT IS TO IMPROVE THE ACCESS CAPABILITY OF LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS TO LOCALLY GROWN HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS, OUR PROGRAMMING WILL NOT BE SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT THE FOUNDATION REVENUE THAT THE SHARED USE KITCHEN WILL BRING INTO OUR BUDGET.WE HAVE PROVEN OUR CONCEPT TOGETHER WITH IVANHOE NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS, AND NOW IT IS TIME TO SCALE THE CLASSES, THE COMMERCIAL KITCHEN, AND OUR NETWORK OF URBAN AND REGIONAL/RURAL FARMERS.

OUR MISSION IS TO BE A RESOURCE CENTER FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT OR AT GREATER RISK OF OBESITY. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MISSION, WE INTEGRATE EVIDENCE-BASED RESOURCES AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PRACTICES USING A HYBRID PROGRAM DELIVERY PLATFORM. THE OVERALL GOAL IS TO HELP MORE FAMILIES TACKLE CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND OBESITY RELATED CHRONIC DISEASES SO THAT THEY CAN LEAD HEALTHIER LIVES. AT A MINIMUM, C.H.O.I.C.E.S. WILL PROVIDE NUTRITION EDUCATION LESSONS VIA COOKING CLASSES TO THOSE THAT CAN AFFORD TO BUY FOOD. SIMULTANEOUSLY,C.H.O.I.C.E.S. WILL ALSO PROMOTE HEALTHY FOOD CONSUMPTION VIA MOBILE FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS TO THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY FOOD. WE WILL ACHIEVE OUR GOAL WHEN ALL METRO ATLANTA FAMILIES MOVE FROM THE MARGINS INTO THE CENTER OF THE HEALTHY EATING AND LIVING MOVEMENT.THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO TACKLE OBESITY AND DIABETES, ESPECIALLY WITH THE REDUCTION OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC RELATED FOOD SUBSIDY PROGRAMS. THIS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE INCREASING RATES OF OBESITY ARE ALREADY HAPPENING NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AS WELL. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD OBESITY FEDERATION&#39;S 2023 ATLAS, PREDICTS THAT 51% OF THE WORLD, OR MORE THAN 4 BILLION PEOPLE, WILL BE OBESE OR OVERWEIGHT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 YEARS. FURTHER, THAT CHILDHOOD OBESITY COULD MORE THAN DOUBLE FROM 2020 LEVELS, TO 208 MILLION BOYS AND 175 MILLION GIRLS BY 2035. (WORLD OBESITY FEDERATION, 2023) THESE PREDICTIONS MAY SEEM ALARMING, BUT HISTORY HAS ALREADY PROVEN THEM TO BE A LIKELY OUTCOME. WITHIN THE PAST 30 YEARS, THE NUMBER OF OBESE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IN THE U.S. HAS TRIPLED (CLEVELAND CLINIC, 2021). ACCORDING TO THE CDC, TODAY APPROXIMATELY 13.7 MILLION CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, AGES 2-19, SUFFER FROM OBESITY AND ARE LIKELY TO BECOME OVERWEIGHT ADULTS, THUS INCREASING THEIR RISK OF HEART DISEASE, TYPE 2 DIABETES, AND OTHER HEALTH ISSUES. WE ALSO KNOW THAT OBESITY CAN HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS UPON A CHILD&#39;S MENTAL AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. THIS CAN MANIFEST AS BULLYING AT SCHOOL OR A CHILD&#39;S INABILITY TO LEARN COURSEWORK AT THEIR GRADE LEVEL. WHEN CHILDREN ARE OVERWEIGHT, THIS OFTEN LEADS TO MORE SERIOUS MEDICAL ISSUES WHEN THEY REACH ADULTHOOD. OBESITY IS A LEADING RISK FACTOR FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES. GEORGIA HAS A DIABETES EPIDEMIC THAT IS AFFECTING MINORITIES LIVING IN LOW-INCOME AREAS DISPROPORTIONATELY. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION, AS OF 2021, APPROXIMATELY 1,013,358 ADULTS IN GEORGIA (12.4 % OF THE ADULT POPULATION) HAVE DIABETES. ANOTHER ESTIMATED 234,000 GEORGIANS HAVE DIABETES BUT THEY DON&#39;T KNOW IT (GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, 202). ADDITIONALLY, DIABETES RATES ARE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH INCOME. GEORGIANS AGES 25+ WHO EARN LESS THAN $25,000 A,YEAR ARE 2.25 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DIABETES THAN THOSE WHO EARN MORE THAN $75,000 ANNUALLY (CDC, 2020). DIABETES IS NOW YET ANOTHER EPIDEMIC ADVERSELY AFFECTING LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH ONSETS BEING TRACKED IN MORE YOUNG ADULTS THAN EVER BEFORE.C.H.O.I.C.E.S.

MEIJER, WHOLE FOODS) HAVE RETURNED TO MORE AFFLUENT AREAS OF THE CITY, MOST RESIDENTS MUST RELY ON ONE OF THE 70 FULL-SERVICE, INDEPENDENT GROCERS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD FOR FOOD PURCHASES DUE TO LIMITED TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. OFTEN WITHIN THESE STORES, THE VARIETY AND QUALITY OF FOOD FOR SALE FALLS CONSIDERABLY BELOW THAT OF CHAIN GROCERS. IN ADDITION, LOCAL DETROIT GROCERS HAVE LIMITED HUMAN CAPITAL AND KNOWLEDGE OF SELLING AND ROTATING HEALTHY FOODS TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS AND INCREASE CONSUMER DEMAND.IN 2014 AND 2018, THE DETROIT GROCERY COALITION (DGC) ENGAGED RESIDENT CONSUMERS (2014: N=51; 2018: N=92) THROUGHOUT ALL SEVEN CITY COUNCIL DISTRICTS TO DISCUSS THEIR PERSPECTIVES OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTHY FOOD ENVIRONMENT, THEIR LOCAL GROCERS AND WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO ENGAGE THEM IN IMPROVING THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD FOOD ENVIRONMENTS. OVERALL, COMMUNITY RESIDENTS SHARED THAT WHILE SOME OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERS OFFERED HIGH-QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTHY FOODS, MANY STORES WITHIN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS DID NOT AND SEVERAL STORES DID NOT PROVIDE WELCOMING CUSTOMER SERVICE. BECAUSE OF THIS, DESPITE LIMITED ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION, MANY DETROIT FAMILIES OBTAINED THEIR GROCERIES FROM CHAIN GROCERS OUTSIDE THE CITY, FURTHER UNDERMINING THE ECONOMIC MOBILITY OF LOCAL GROCERS. DURING THESE DISCUSSIONS, AND THROUGH CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND SEVEN PARTNERING COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS (CBOS), RESIDENT FAMILIES EXPRESSED INTEREST IN ASSISTING THE DGC IN ESTABLISHING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR LOCAL GROCERS TO COLLECTIVELY IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY FOOD ENVIRONMENT.IDENTIFYING, PROMOTING AND ASSISTING GROCERS IN STOCKING, SELLING AND PROMOTING HEALTHY FOODS CAN HELP LOW-INCOME DETROITERS MAKE HEALTHIER FOOD CHOICES AND CAN HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES, COMMUNITY HEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS AND LOCAL ECONOMIES, THEREFORE, THE DETROIT GROCERY COALITION IS PROPOSING TO CREATE AND PROMOTE THE GREAT GROCER PROJECT. THE GGP INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES: 1.) A HEALTHY GROCER PROMOTION (HGP) CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE DETROIT INDEPENDENT GROCERS AND INCREASESALES OF HIGH-QUALITY, HEALTHY FOODS; 2.) A HEALTHY FOOD MARKETING INITIATIVE (HFMI) WITHIN THE 10 HIGHEST-SCORING STORES THAT PROVIDES NUTRITION EDUCATION TO LOW-INCOME CONSUMERS; 3.) AN \"ADOPT A SHOP\" COMMUNITY TRAINING INITIATIVE IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR SEVEN PARTNER CBOS, THAT BUILDS LOCAL CAPACITY TO WORK WITH GROCERS AND ENSURES THE CONTINUATION OF HIGH-QUALITY FOOD SALES IN DETROIT; AND 4.) DEVELOPMENT OF A TOOLKIT TO SHARE WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN SIMILAR LOW-INCOME SETTINGS. THE OVERALL GOAL FOR THE GGP INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION AND A DECREASE IN SIMPLE CARBOHYDRATE CONSUMPTION AMONG 150 LOW-INCOME DETROIT FAMILIES IN THREE YEARS, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS TO 35% OF THE GROCERY RETAIL ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN DETROIT. THIS LONG-TERM GOAL WILL BE ACHIEVED BY IMPLEMENTING THE INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.HEALTHY GROCER PROMOTION: BASELINE DATA WAS COLLECTED IN 2018 USING THE NUTRITION ENVIRONMENT MEASURES SURVEY (NEMS) FOR GROCERY STORES (N=74), INTERVIEWS WITH A SUB-SAMPLE OF STORE OWNERS/MANAGERS (N=43) AND SURVEYS AMONG CUSTOMERS (N=200) WITHIN 37 DETROIT STORES. THE NEMS RESULTS WERE UTILIZED TO CREATE FIVE GGP CATEGORIES: 1) HEALTHY FOOD AVAILABILITY, 2) AFFORDABILITY AND 3) QUALITY (AS INDICATED BY NEMS), 4) CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SAFETY (AS INDICATED BY CUSTOMER SURVEYS), AND 5) PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES (E.G., DONATIONS TO LOCAL SCHOOLS/CHURCHES, PARTICIPATION IN DOUBLE UP FOOD BUCKS, ETC.) AND THESE RESULTS WERE SHARED WITH CBO PARTNERS IN MAY 2020. RESULTS INDICATED MOST STORES OFFERED A VARIETY OF HIGH-QUALITY HEALTHY FOODS BUT ONLY SEVEN STORES MET AFFORDABILITY AND HALF OF DETROIT STORES MET CUSTOMER SERVICE. STORES THAT RANK IN THE TOP 10 OF THESE CATEGORIES WILL RECEIVE PROMOTION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY VIA CONNECTION TO MEDIA OUTLETS, DGC PARTNER PROJECTS AND CBOS, WHO WILL HOLD AT LEAST ONE PROMOTIONAL EVENT WITHIN EACH STORE PER YEAR. THE DGC WILL PROVIDE TRAINING AND PEER TO PEER MENTORSHIP FOR UP TO 30 STORE OWNERS AND STAFF ABOUT HEALTH ISSUES THAT IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE--INCLUDING SAFETY MEASURES FOR COVID-19 AND FUTURE PANDEMICS, MODELS FOR PROFITABLE PRODUCE OPERATIONS, MARKETING OF HEALTHY FOODS, AND INFORMATION ABOUT MEDIUM-SIZED LOCAL FARMS AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE SUPPLIERS TO STORE OWNERS.HEALTHY FOOD MARKETING INITIATIVE (HFMI): IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CBOS, WE WILL ALSO IMPLEMENT A HFMI WITHIN THE TOP 10 GGP STORES TO PROMOTE THE SALE OF HEALTHY FOODS. THE HFMI MATERIALS WILL BE ALIGNED TO THE LOGO AND DESIGN OF THE GGP CAMPAIGN AND FOODS WILL BE TAGGED IN A STOPLIGHT FORMAT THROUGHOUT THE STORE. CULTURALLY TAILORED, QUICK AND EASY RECIPES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE PRODUCE SECTION, AT CHECKOUT AND ON THE GGP WEBPAGE AND WILL BE CREATED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CBOS.ADOPT A SHOP COMMUNITY CAPACITY BUILDING: SEVEN CBOS AND RESIDENT FAMILIES WILL ASSIST IN FINALIZING THE GGP TOOLKIT AND TRAINING PROGRAM THAT BUILDS NEIGHBORHOOD CAPACITY TO DEVELOP A FORUM FOR COMMUNICATION THAT BENEFITS BOTH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND GROCERS. CBOS WILL GAIN SKILLS IN CONDUCTING IN-STORE FOOD ASSESSMENTS (NEMS), PROVIDING NUTRITION EDUCATION IN STORES, AND WILL ALSO ENHANCE THEIR COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE THE HEALTHY FOOD OFFERINGS WITHIN THEIR LOCAL STORES. THROUGH THESE EFFORTS, WE AIM TO IDENTIFY AT LEAST ONE (POSSIBLY TWO) COMMUNITY RESIDENT(S) FROM EACH OF THE SEVEN DETROIT NEIGHBORHOODS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE MONITORING OF THEIR LOCAL GROCERS AND EXPAND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH NEW, LOCAL GROCERS.TOOLKIT: A TOOLKIT WILL BE DEVELOPED ON THE COMPONENTS OF THE GGP SO THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES CAN IMPLEMENT THIS PROJECT WITH FIDELITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR LOCAL FOOD RETAILERS.WE WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE GGP AMONG 150 LOW-INCOME DETROIT RESIDENTS AND 25 INDEPENDENT DETROIT GROCERS THROUGH THE USE OF MULTIPLE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE MEASURES. IN-STORE ASSESSMENTS OF HEALTHY FOOD AVAILABILITY, COST AND QUALITY WILL BE CONDUCTED USING THE NEMS TOOL AND STORE SALES WILL BE MONITORED IN ALL 70 GROCERS. COMPARISONS WILL BE MADE WITHIN THE 25 GGP STORES AND STORES THAT ARE NOT PROMOTED VIA THIS PROJECT. CONSUMER KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, MOTIVATIONS AND BEHAVIORS FOR HEALTHY EATING WILL BE ASSESSED USING VALID AND RELIABLE SURVEYS AND NARRATIVE REPORTS WILL BE COLLECTED VIA FOCUS GROUPS. THESE MEASURES WILL BE COLLECTED THREE TIMES OVER THE LENGTH OF THE PROJECT TO DETERMINE IMPACT ON THE HEALTHY FOOD ENVIRONMENT, COMMUNITY HEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY WITHIN LOCAL GROCERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "57f1d8a4-43a0-9952-a047-67afb28d0b55-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20203380033132_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 111064363, "Award ID": "20203380033131", "Award Amount": 35000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-15", "CFDA Number": "10.225", "Description": "URBAN LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES IN COMMUNITY FOOD ECOSYSTEMS: NOURISHING UNDERSERVED STUDENTS, FAMILIES, AND NEIGHBORS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "45c66685-f93c-9b9b-91fa-40d223c51ad2-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20203380033131_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 111064364, "Award ID": "20203380033130", "Award Amount": 35000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-17", "CFDA Number": "10.225", "Description": "LINKING THE AGRICULTURAL AND CULTURAL ROOTS OF SOUTHEAST GAINESVILLE TO INCREASE FOOD ACCESS AND SOVEREIGNTY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "a7ea11f1-6f68-aa07-23b7-53b785d3be63-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20203380033130_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 111064365, "Award ID": "20203380033129", "Award Amount": 35000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-11", "CFDA Number": "10.225", "Description": "ESTABLISHING THE PUTNAM COUNTY FOOD SYSTEM COALITION TO CONDUCT A COMMUNITY FOOD ASSESSMENT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4b080d5b-f10b-62bc-495b-3e879b8cfb62-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20203380033129_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 85400209, "Award ID": "20193380030387", "Award Amount": 366850.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-29", "CFDA Number": "10.225", "Description": "THIS PROJECT BUILDS ON A 2016 COMMUNITY FOODS PROJECTS PLANNING GRANT TO CONDUCT THE CLARKSTON FOOD NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND TO FORM THE FOOD PLANNING NETWORK.
