ACROSS SSA, COUNTRY- LEVEL APPLICATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES TO SCREEN AND MANAGE HTN IS LOW AND VARIABLE DUE TO LACK OF SERVICE READINESS, UNEVEN HEALTH WORKER MOTIVATION, WEAK HEALTH WORKER ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS, AND POOR INTEGRATION OF HTN SCREENING AND MANAGEMENT WITH CHRONIC CARE SERVICES. IN MOZAMBIQUE, WHERE HIV PREVALENCE IS >13%, THE HIV TREATMENT PLATFORM IS THE ONLY SCALED CHRONIC CARE SERVICE. WITH OVER 900,000 PATIENTS ON ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY, IT PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STANDARDIZE AND SCALE HTN CARE CASCADE SERVICES. LOW-COST, SYSTEMS-LEVEL STRATEGIES ARE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING LINKED CASCADE SERVICES AND MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR ROUTINIZING HTN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT WITHIN EXISTING HIV SERVICES; IMPROVING FLOW THROUGH THE HTN CASCADE; AND IMPROVING PATIENT-LEVEL OUTCOMES.

THE RESEARCH THEME CHOSEN FOR THIS U54 HIV-ASSOCIATED MALIGNANCY RESEARCH CENTER (HAMRC) IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL, LOW-COST AND TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE APPROACHES FOR CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT IN WOMEN LIVING WITH HIV (WLWH) IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS). THIS HAMRC WILL BE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS IN THE US, MOZAMBIQUE AND BRAZIL AND INCLUDES INVESTIGATORS WITH EXPERTISE IN HIV/AIDS, CERVICAL CANCER, BIOENGINEERING, PATHOLOGY, EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE. THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE SEVERAL ONGOING SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL COLLABORATIONS WHICH INCLUDE PROJECTS ACROSS ALL THREE COUNTRIES. OUR PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE NIH PRIORITY: TO ADDRESS HIV-ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES, COINFECTIONS AND COMPLICATIONS, WHICH INCLUDES MALIGNANCIES AS A CATEGORY. HIV INFECTION IS A KNOWN RISK FACTOR FOR CERVICAL CANCER, WITH WLWH HAVING AN APPROXIMATE 6-FOLD INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING CERVICAL CANCER.

THE PAVILION THEME IS RESEARCH OF UNDERSTUDIED, VIRUS-ASSOCIATED TUMORS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT MEN AND WOMEN LIVING WITH HIV IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). SSA REMAINS HOME TO TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH). HIV-RELATED IMMUNOSUPPRESSION RESULTS IN AN INABILITY TO CONTROL VIRUSES AND THEREFORE A HIGHER RISK OF VIRUS-ASSOCIATED CANCER, EVEN AMONG PLWH ON EFFECTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY. THE INCREASING LIFE-EXPECTANCY OF PLWH COMPOUNDS THIS CANCER RISK AS CANCER IS NOW A LEADING CAUSE OF MORTALITY AMONG PLWH IN BOTH HIGH AND LOW RESOURCE COUNTRIES. FURTHERMORE, PLWH EXPERIENCE POORER CANCER TREATMENT OUTCOMES. DESPITE THIS, FEW STUDIES OF CANCER ETIOLOGY AND CANCER OUTCOMES AMONG PLWH IN LMICS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED, WITH LITTLE FOCUS ON HPV CANCERS AT EXTRA-CERVICAL ANATOMIC SITES AND VERY FEW STUDIES OF A SUSPECTED VIRAL ETIOLOGY FOR CONJUNCTIVAL TUMORS. PAVILION WILL THEREFORE FOCUS ON THE FULL RANGE OF CANCERS CAUSED BY HPV (ANAL, CERVICAL, OROPHARYNGEAL, PENILE, AND VULVAR CANCERS) AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF EBV IN CONJUNCTIVAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA - CANCERS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONALITY HIGHER AMONG PLWH, AND WHICH RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THE OVERALL GOAL OF PAVILION IS TO PROVIDE THE DATA NECESSARY TO INFORM PREVENTION AND THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CANCERS AMONG PLWH IN SSA. PAVILION INCLUDES PARTNERS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND ZIMBABWE, MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS IN THE US, AND THE DKFZ IN GERMANY.

YET, THERE IS VERY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS, THE POSSIBLE POLICIES AND INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS THEM, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LIMITED CAPACITY IN RESEARCH OF SUCH POLICIES AND INTERVENTIONS. THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL ESTABLISH THE GEOHEALTH HUB FOR CLIMATE CHANGE HEALTH IMPACTS IN MENA THROUGH ITS TWO COMPONENTS: THE U01 RESEARCH COMPONENT (1/2 GEOHEALTH HUB FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA- JORDAN) AND THE U2R TRAINING COMPONENT. THE RESEARCH AND TRAINING WILL TAKE PLACE IN JORDAN, LEBANON, AND MOROCCO. THE CLIMATE RELEVANT AREAS OF RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON HEAT WAVES, PRECIPITATION AND WATER QUALITY, AIR POLLUTION, AND DESERT DUST POLLUTION. COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSES OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH POLICIES WILL BE DETERMINED TO QUANTIFY HEALTH BENEFITS FROM INTERVENTIONS THROUGH ECONOMIC MODELS AND THEN INFORMING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE. THESE WILL BE LINKED TO THE U2R GEOHEALTH HUB TRAINING APPLICATION TITLED \u201c2/2 GEOHEALTH HUB FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA-U.S. THE TRAINING PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON CREATING A CADRE OF LOCAL EXPERTS IN ONE OR MORE OF THE AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IN THE SCOPE OF THE U01. THE U2R TRAINING WILL BUILD ON THE ONGOING R25 TRAINING GRANT BETWEEN THE TWO COLLABORATING ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN JORDAN (JORDAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-JUST) AND THE U.S. (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO) (2R25TW010026-06A1). WE HAVE ASSEMBLED AN EXCEPTIONAL TEAM OF COLLABORATORS FROM THE TOP INSTITUTIONS LED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO AND WITH UC BERKELEY, AND HARVARD UNIVERSITY, AS WELL AS SUPPORT OF THE U.S. CDC. THIS WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY PARTNERSHIP IN THE MENA REPRESENTED BY THE JORDAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN JORDAN, UNIVERSITY OF BALAMAND IN LEBANON, MOHAMED VI UNIVERSITY FOR HEALTH SCIENCES IN MOROCCO, AND THE WHO REGIONAL EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ACTION LOCATED IN AMMAN, JORDAN. THE TRAINING PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE SHORT TERM DIDACTICS IN THE FORM OF SUMMER COURSES, WORKSHOPS, U.S VISITS, AND VIRTUAL WEBINARS TO BUILD INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY BUILDING. WE WILL BUILD INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY THROUGH THE ADDITION OF TRACKS IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TO EXISTING MASTERS AND PHD PROGRAMS. WE WILL ALSO HAVE MENTORED ONE-ON-ONE RESEARCH TRAINING ON WORK RELATED TO THE U01 AIMS. WE WILL ALSO AIM TO INFLUENCE OVERALL AWARENESS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE HEALTH IMPACTS AMONG THE GENERAL HEALTH AND POLICY PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY THROUGH AN ANNUAL REGIONAL CONFERENCE TO SHOWCASE THE HUB.

ABSTRACT THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA) REGION IS GOING TO BE AT THE CENTER OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADVERSE HEALTH IMPACTS. ALREADY RECORD HEATWAVES, HIGH FREQUENCY OF DESERT DUST STORMS, DROUGHT AND LOW PRECIPITATION, AND HIGH AIR POLLUTION ARE BEING DOCUMENTED. HOWEVER, STUDIES ABOUT THEIR HEALTH IMPACTS ON THE POPULATIONS ARE SCARCE AND NOT LINKED TO CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES AND THERE IS LIMITED MULTI-COUNTRY EFFORTS IN THE MENA REGION TO ADDRESS THE DIFFERENT HEALTH EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IN OUR PROJECT, WE AIM TO ESTABLISH THE \u201cGEOHEALTH HUB FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN MENA\u201d THROUGH TWO COMPONENTS: THE U2R WHICH REPRESENTS THE PART RELATED TO CAPACITY BUILDING OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE MENA REGIONS AND THE U01 WHICH IS THE COMPONENT DEVELOPING THE RESEARCH PROFILE. FROM MENA, THE JORDAN UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, THE UNIVERSITY OF BALAMAND, AND MOHAMED VI UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES WILL BE PARTNERING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY, AND HARVARD UNIVERSITY FROM THE U.S. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. CDC, AND THE WHO CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ACTION WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE HUB. THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON HEALTH, WATER, AIR POLLUTION AND IDENTIFIED GAPS AND AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BE THE INITIAL FOCUS OF THE HUB. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE AND SUPPORT CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES THAT PROTECT AND PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND BECOME THE STATE-OF-THE-ART ENTITY TO PROVIDE MODELS AND TOOLS FOR QUANTIFYING THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS IN RELATION TO WATER SCARCITY, HEAT WAVES, AIR POLLUTION, AND DESERT DUST. THE RESEARCH PROJECT IN JORDAN WILL STUDY THE IMPACT OF TWO CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS: (1) WATER SCARCITY AND NITRATE POLLUTION AND (2) HEATWAVES. THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DOWNSCALED CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE CONSTRUCTED TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF NITRATE POLLUTION ACROSS JORDAN WILL BE ASSESSED. MOREOVER, THE IMPACT OF NITRATE LEVELS ON BIRTH WEIGHT OF NEWBORNS WILL BE DOCUMENTED. FURTHERMORE, THE IMPACT OF HEATWAVES ON MORTALITY UNDER THE BASELINE CLIMATE SCENARIO AS WELL AS UNDER THE CLIMATE ENSEMBLE MODEL PREDICTIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED. IN LEBANON, THE HEALTH IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION ON RESPIRATORY, CARDIOVASCULAR, AND SKIN ALLERGIC DISEASES AMONG WOMEN AND CHILDREN WILL BE STUDIED. IN MOROCCO, THE ASSOCIATION OF DESERT DUST AIR POLLUTION WITH CLIMATE WILL BE DETERMINED USING LARGE-SCALE ATMOSPHERIC PATTERNS AND CLIMATE INDICES. SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS FAVORABLE TO PARTICULATE POLLUTION PARTIALLY ORIGINATING FROM THE SAHARAN DESERT WILL BE IDENTIFIED. THESE STUDIES BUILD ON PRIOR RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE TEAM MEMBERS AND WILL BE FOLLOWED UP BY POLICIES RECOMMENDATIONS ON WASTEWATER REUSE, HEATWAVES ALERTS, AND AIR POLLUTION FROM COMBUSTION AND DESERT DUST.

THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT (AUB) IN LEBANON (U01 APPLICATION) IS PARTNERING WITH YALE UNIVERSITY (U2R APPLICATION) IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA IN THE US TO ESTABLISH A GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND TRAINING HUB FOR THE MENA REGION (GEOHEALTH MENA), WHERE AUB SERVES AS THE HUB INSTITUTION AND ONE UNIVERSITY IN EACH OF EGYPT AND SUDAN WILL SERVE AS SPOKE INSTITUTIONS. THE AIM OF GEOHEALTH MENA IS TO BUILD AND STRENGTHEN EOH RESEARCH CAPACITY IN THE CONTEXT OF DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS, AT AUB, SISTER INSTITUTIONS, AND RELEVANT NGOS IN LEBANON AND THE MENA REGION. THE FOCUS OF THE CURRENT PROJECT WILL BE AGRICULTURAL HEALTH AND SAFETY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDE AMONG REFUGEE POPULATIONS. THE MENA REGION HOSTS MORE THAN 50% OF THE WORLD\u2019S TOTAL POPULATION OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS AND REFUGEES. THE U01 APPLICATION PROPOSES TO EVALUATE THE PATHWAYS OF PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AMONG SYRIAN REFUGEE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS, INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION OF SUCH EXPOSURE WITH NEUROBEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES, AND EXPLORE THE ROLE OF SOCIAL FACTORS IN THIS ASSOCIATION. FINDINGS WILL INFORM POLICY AND PRACTICE GUIDELINES THAT CAN IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF ALL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM AT AUB WILL BUILD ON A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF STUDYING REFUGEE AND MIGRANT POPULATIONS AND TRANSLATING EVIDENCE INTO POLICY. YALE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE AUB TEAM IN EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT AND THE ASSESSMENT OF NEUROBEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE. THE U2R WILL PROVIDE FULL SCHOLARSHIPS TO 3 HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND COMMITTED APPLICANTS (ONE FROM EACH OF EGYPT, LEBANON, AND SUDAN) TO PURSUE A PHD IN EPIDEMIOLOGY AT AUB\u2019S FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES (FHS) FOCUSING ON EOH ISSUES. THE U2R WILL ALSO PROVIDE FULL SCHOLARSHIPS TO 4 HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND COMMITTED MDS (TWO FROM LEBANON AND ONE FROM EACH OF EGYPT AND SUDAN) TO PURSUE AN MPH AT AUB\u2019S FHS AND A FELLOWSHIP IN OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AT AUB\u2019S FACULTY OF MEDICINE. THE 7 TRAINEES WILL SPEND 3 MONTHS (MD/MPH) OR 6 MONTHS (PHD) DURING THEIR STUDY PERIOD AT YALE AND IOWA FOR ADVANCED AND RELEVANT RESEARCH TRAINING AND TRAINING ON AGRICULTURAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (AGS&H).

ULAANBAATAR (UB) AND DARKHAN CITY (DC) HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST AMBIENT PARTICULATE MATTER (PM) CONCENTRATIONS IN THE WORLD AND FREQUENTLY SUFFER EPIDEMICS OF VIRAL RESPIRATORY DISEASES. THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PM EXPOSURE AND CARDIORESPIRATORY MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED, WITH AN ESTABLISHED 6.67 MILLION PREMATURE DEATHS GLOBALLY ATTRIBUTED TO AIR POLLUTION IN 2019. RECENTLY, ATTENTION HAS INCREASED REGARDING THE ASSOCIATION OF PM POLLUTION AND RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTION. HENCE, THIS U01 PROPOSAL, AS PART OF THE MONGOLIAN GEOHEALTH HUB PROGRAM, FOCUSES ON STUDYING THE RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PM EXPOSURE AND RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTIONS. THE U01 PROJECT CONSISTS OF A MAIN STUDY AND TWO PILOT STUDIES TO BEGIN CENTER ACTIVITIES. THE MAIN PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PM EXPOSURE WEAKENS THE IMMUNE DEFENSE AGAINST RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTION. IT HAS THREE INTERCONNECTED SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1 IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PM EXPOSURE AND RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTION THROUGH A TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS OF WEEKLY INFLUENZA-LIKE ILLNESS (ILI) RATES IN ASSOCIATION WITH PM LEVELS WITHIN AND ACROSS UB AND DC, ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS AND CO-POLLUTANTS. AS AN AIR POLLUTION CONTROL MEASURE, UB STARTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCESSED COAL USE IN MAY, 2019, WHEREAS DC CONTINUES TO USE RAW COAL. NESTING THIS POLICY INTERVENTION INTO THE TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS STRENGTHENS THE CAUSAL INFERENCE OF THE PM-ILI ASSOCIATION DERIVED FROM NATURAL VARIABILITIES OVER TIME. AIM 2 IS TO EXAMINE IMMUNOLOGIC AND VIRAL RESPONSES TO PERSONAL PM EXPOSURE THROUGH TWO PARALLEL PANEL STUDIES IN RESIDENTS OF UB AND DC, RESPECTIVELY. EACH PANEL CONSISTS OF 100-120 NONSMOKING ADULTS WHO WILL BE MEASURED SEMIANNUALLY DURING A 3-YEAR FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. ILI COUNTS AND IMMUNOLOGIC BIOMARKERS WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL PM EXPOSURES. AIM 3 IS TO DEFINE THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF PM EXPOSURE ON EPITHELIAL INTEGRITY AND IMMUNE SIGNALING AND THE SUBSEQUENT IMPACT ON ANTI-VIRAL RESPONSES. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CELL CULTURE STUDIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO AIM 2 SUBJECTS (AS CELL DONORS). THE TWO PILOT STUDIES, BUILT UPON THE AIM 2 MAIN STUDY, AIM TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF PM ON PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS AND BONE MINERAL LOSS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE STUDIES ARE MOTIVATED BY HIGH PREVALENCE OF BOTH TUBERCULOSIS AND OSTEOPOROSIS IN MONGOLIA AND BY EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTING PM OR HEAVY METALS IN PM AS RISK FACTORS. THIS U01 PROPOSAL IS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROJECT INVOLVING RESEARCHERS IN EPIDEMIOLOGY, TOXICOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, EXPOSURE SCIENCE, BIOSTATISTICS, VIROLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, RESPIRATORY MEDICINE, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE FROM MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS IN MONGOLIA, DUKE UNIVERSITY, AND DUKE KUNSHAN UNIVERSITY.

ALTHOUGH OXYGEN IS POTENTIALLY A LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT FOR HYPOXEMIC LRIS, HEALTH SYSTEMS IN LMICS DO NOT HAVE WELL ESTABLISHED OXYGEN SYSTEMS TO APPROPRIATELY MATCH SUPPLY WITH DEMAND TO OPTIMALLY BENEFIT CHILDREN.

MSM ARE OFTEN HESITANT TO DISCLOSE THEIR SEXUALITY, RISK BEHAVIORS OR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, MOSTLY DUE TO FEAR OF STIGMA, DISCRIMINATION, OR CRIMINALIZATION. STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION ARE ALSO ENACTED ON MSM BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS RESULTING IN EXTRAORDINARY HEALTH DISPARITIES AND LOW PREVENTION UPTAKE.

B2C DEMAND, COUPLED WITH HEALTHCARE WORKER CONSTRAINTS, RESULTS IN TRACING OF ONLY 33% OF TARGET CLIENTS. MOREOVER, POOR DATA QUALITY REDUCES B2C EFFECTIVENESS. THEREFORE, LT AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\u2019S INTERNATIONAL TRAINING AND EDUCATION CENTER FOR HEALTH (I-TECH), WITH SUPPORT FROM MOH AND MEDIC, IMPLEMENTED AN INNOVATIVE, PROACTIVE, PATIENT RETENTION SYSTEM USING TWO-WAY TEXTING (2WT) BETWEEN NEW ART PATIENTS AND STAFF (1R21TW011658-01). 2WT AIMED TO RESOLVE POTENTIAL RETENTION ISSUES BEFORE THEY OCCUR AND IMPROVE DATA QUALITY (E.G. IDENTIFYING TRANSFERS), REDUCING B2C WORKLOAD. 2WT PARTICIPANTS HAD HIGHER RETENTION ESTIMATES (95%, 95% CI 91-975) AT 3 MONTHS POST ART INITIATION COMPARED TO NON 2WT PATIENTS (86%, 95% CI 82-89%). PRELIMINARY RESULTS ON RETENTION IMPROVEMENTS AND WORKLOAD REDUCTION FROM R21 PHASE AT MPC WERE WELCOMED BY MOH. IN SUPPORT OF WIDESPREAD ADOPTION AND SCALE UP, MOH REQUESTS RIGOROUS EVIDENCE FROM A 2WT RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT). IN R33 YEAR 1, THE PROPOSED MHEALTH STUDY SUPPLEMENT WILL CONDUCT AN RCT AT LH AND MPC CLINICS, USING THE ESTABLISHED 2WT SYSTEM AND THE EXISTING 2WT OPERATIONS TEAM, MINIMIZING COSTS WHILE MAXIMIZING EVIDENCE GENERATION. RCT COMPARES OUTCOMES AMONG 410 NEW ART PATIENTS RANDOMIZED 1:1 INTO 2WT (INTERVENTION) AND CONTROL (STANDARD B2C). RCT OUTCOMES REFLECT SHORTENED TIMELINE (6- VS. 12-MONTHS), BUT SAME OUTCOMES: RETENTION (ART OUTCOMES, VISIT ADHERENCE) AND B2C REFERRALS.

ASSESSMENT OF COGNITIVE AND MOTOR IMPAIRMENT IN PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND HIV-STROKE - PROJECT SUMMARY ABOUT 37 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) WORLDWIDE AND ABOUT 71% OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH) RESIDE IN LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS). HIV ENTERS THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) EARLY AFTER INFECTION AND INCREASES THE RISK FOR MILD-TO-SEVERE NEUROCOGNITIVE AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS. STUDIES SHOW THAT ABOUT 30 TO 40% OF PLWH WILL HAVE NEUROLOGIC COMPLICATIONS LEADING TO LONG-TERM MOTOR AND COGNITIVE DISABILITY, INCLUDING HIV-ASSOCIATED NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS (HAND). FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED HOW BEST TO PROVIDE OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT, DIAGNOSTIC, AND REHABILITATIVE TREATMENT TOOLS TO AID PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES AS A RESULT OF HIV AND HIV-STROKE IN LMICS. THE NEED FOR THESE TOOLS IS GREAT IN LMICS, GIVEN THE GREATLY LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE AND HEALTHCARE RESOURCES AND THUS DECREASED ACCESS TO CONSISTENT, QUALITY REHABILITATION. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND AFFORDABLE ROBOT TECHNOLOGIES TO BRIDGE HEALTHCARE CARE GAPS IN LMICS AND LEVERAGE THEM TO HELP OBJECTIVELY ASSESS, DIAGNOSE AND TREAT PLWH PRESENTING WITH MOTOR AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT DUE TO HAND AND STROKE. IN THIS R21 PROJECT, WE LEVERAGE OUR AFFORDABLE ROBOT THERAPY SYSTEM AUGMENTED WITH OBJECTIVE METRICS AND MOTOR AND COGNITIVE EXERGAMES TO ASSESS PLWH IN BOTSWANA\u2014A COUNTRY WITH THE FOURTH HIGHEST HIV PREVALENCE RATE (20.3%) IN THE WORLD, AN INCREASING NCD PREVALENCE RATE, AND LIMITED REHAB RESOURCES. AIM 1 DETERMINES CONCURRENT VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF USING THE ROBOT THERAPY SYSTEM TO OBJECTIVELY ASSESS COGNITIVE, AND MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS IN PLWH. FORTY (40) PLWH AND 40 HIV-NEGATIVE CONTROLS WILL BE EVALUATED USING BOTH CLINICAL METRICS AND NEW ROBOT-BASED METRICS AT TWO TIME POINTS, AT LEAST 1-WEEK APART. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ROBOT-BASED METRICS WILL HAVE TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY AS WELL AS CONCURRENT VALIDITY WITH CLINICAL MEASURES OF MOTOR AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION THAT USUALLY REQUIRE REHABILITATION EXPERTISE AND MAN-POWER TO COMPLETE. AIM 2 DETERMINES THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A ROBOT-BASED CLASSIFICATION OF HIV-ASSOCIATED NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS (HAND). 80 PLWH WITHOUT STROKE WILL BE EVALUATED USING AN AUGMENTED NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL (NP) BATTERY REQUIRED TO MEET MINIMAL HAND FRASCATI CRITERIA AND THE ROBOT ASSESSMENT TASKS. WE WILL USE THE FRASCATI CRITERIA AND GLOBAL DEFICIT SCORING (GDS) TO CLASSIFY THE PLWH PARTICIPANTS INTO ASYMPTOMATIC NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (ANI), MILD NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER (MND) AND HIV- ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA (HAD). WE WILL DEVELOP A REGRESSION MODEL USING DERIVED ROBOT METRICS AND TEST ITS ABILITY TO PREDICT HAND AND GDS SCORE.

IN RURAL HAITI, WHERE I HAVE WORKED SINCE 2012, ~46% OF MEDICAL WARD ADMISSIONS ARE DUE TO HF AND INPATIENT FATALITY IS 11%. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINES FOR HF ARE USED ONLY 21% OF THE TIME. HOWEVER, SUBOPTIMAL TREATMENT CANNOT BE ADDRESSED UNLESS WE FIRST CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DIAGNOSIS. THE LACK OF ACCESS TO (1) ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY, AND (2) CLINICIANS WITH SKILLS TO INTERPRET THEM ARE MAJOR BARRIERS TO HF TREATMENT. HAITI HAS ONLY 17 CARDIOLOGISTS FOR A POPULATION OF 11 MILLION.

IN AIM 1, WE WILL EXAMINE THE MANIFESTATIONS OF HIV STIGMA DURING THE INTRAPARTUM PERIOD USING ROBUST QUALITATIVE METHODS, INCLUDING IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, OBSERVATIONS OF CHILDBIRTH, AND FACILITY ASSESSMENTS. IN AIM 2, WE WILL DEVELOP MAMA (MRADI WA AFYA YA MAMA MZAZI, PROJECT TO SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF WOMEN GIVING BIRTH) BY ADAPTING THE EVIDENCE- BASED PRONTO INTERNATIONAL CURRICULUM OF SIMULATION TRAINING TO IMPROVE EVIDENCE-BASED MANAGEMENT OF BIRTH AND RESPECTFUL MATERNITY CARE (RMC). USING ITERATIVE METHODS OF THE ADAPT-ITT MODEL, WE WILL BUILD ON LOCAL CONTEXTUAL ISSUES AND EXAMPLES GLEANED FROM AIM 1 TO DEVELOP CONTENT SPECIFIC TO PROMOTING RESPECTFUL, NON-STIGMATIZING BIRTH FOR WLHIV. IN AIM 3, WE WILL PILOT TEST THE MAMA INTERVENTION WITH L&D PROVIDERS AT SIX CLINICS IN THE KILIMANJARO REGION OF TANZANIA. PRE- AND POST-SURVEYS WITH PROVIDERS (N=60) WILL ASSESS RMC PRACTICES, INSTRUMENTAL STIGMA AND STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES. SURVEYS AND MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW WITH WLHIV WHO GIVE BIRTH IN THE STUDY CLINICS WILL BE COMPARED IN THE PRE-TRAINING AND THE POST-TRAINING PERIODS (N=206), EXAMINING RMC AS A PRIMARY OUTCOME. THE PROCTOR FRAMEWORK WILL GUIDE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY METRICS.

RESILIENCE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT PROTECTIVE FACTOR AGAINST MINORITY STRESS. A RECENT U.S.-BASED STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT ESTEEM, A COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY-BASED INTERVENTION AIMED AT PROMOTING PERSONAL AGENCY AND RESILIENCE IS EFFICACIOUS IN IMPROVING MENTAL AND SEXUAL HEALTH OF YOUNG GBM.

IN TANZANIA, A PEPFAR STRATEGY COUNTRY WITH AN ADULT HIV PREVALENCE OF 4.8%, ONLY 83% OF PWH ARE AWARE OF THEIR STATUS. MORE THAN 200,000 UNDIAGNOSED PWH NEED TO TEST IN ORDER TO REACH THE \u201cFIRST 95\u201d. WITH THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF TRADITIONAL HIV TESTING APPROACHES DECLINING, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE A NOVEL APPLICATION OF MOBILE HEALTH (MHEALTH) TECHNOLOGY THAT LEVERAGES THE UBIQUITY OF MOBILE PHONES AND THE REACH OF SOCIAL NETWORKS TO INCREASE RATES OF HIV TESTING, ESPECIALLY AMONG HIGHER-RISK INDIVIDUALS.

NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (NCI) IS A COMMON COMPLICATION OF ACUTE BRAIN INJURY IN TWO UNRELATED NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS: CEREBRAL MALARIA (CM) AND TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI). IN CHILDREN AGES 5\u201315 YEARS, SIX OF THE TOP 15 CAUSES OF MORTALITY AND DISABILITY ARE INJURY-RELATED, AND 95% OF THESE OCCUR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE- INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS). THE BURDEN OF TBI IN LMICS IS NOT FULLY KNOWN BUT IS ESTIMATED AT THREE TIMES MORE THAN IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES. MEANWHILE, THE HIGH BURDEN OF PEDIATRIC CM IS BORNE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY AFRICAN NATIONS. THUS, THERE IS A GLOBAL NEED FOR RELIABLE, NONINVASIVE PROGNOSTIC TOOLS THAT CAN PREDICT THE RISK OF FUTURE NCI AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER ACUTE BRAIN INJURY. BIOMARKERS OF BRAIN INJURY\u2014PROTEINS EXPRESSED IN THE BRAIN PARENCHYMA (BY NEURONS AND ASTROCYTES)\u2014CAN BE USEFUL PROGNOSTIC TOOLS IN BRAIN INJURY. NEURONAL INJURY MARKERS TAU AND UCH- L1, AND ASTROCYTE INJURY MARKER GFAP CAN PREDICT NCI AFTER MODERATE/SEVERE TBI; LIKEWISE, TAU AND UCH-L1 ARE ELEVATED IN CM AND PREDICT FUTURE NCI. FURTHER, THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGIES OF CM AND TBI HAVE OVERLAPPING FEATURES: INJURY TO THE BRAIN\u2019S MICROVASCULATURE LEADS TO HYPOXIA/ISCHEMIA WITH GLUCOSE ABNORMALITIES, CELLULAR INJURY, AND ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION. THESE EFFECTS INTERACT TO COMPLICATE ACUTE BRAIN INJURY RESULTING IN IMPAIRED COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. OUR GROUP HAS LED STUDIES IDENTIFYING BIOMARKERS AND RISK FACTORS OF PEDIATRIC CM IN AN LMIC SETTING, BUT NO SUCH RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED FOR PEDIATRIC TBI TO UNDERSTAND BRAIN INJURY IN CHILDREN AT RISK OF NCI AFTER TBI. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE, WE PROPOSE A STUDY TO: (1) SCREEN A SPECIFIC SET OF BLOOD BIOMARKERS IMPLICATED IN NCI AFTER CM FOR THEIR ROLES IN NCI AFTER TBI IN UGANDA AND (2) BUILD ON THE SUCCESSFUL WORK ON CM AND NCI BY MEMBERS OF OUR RESEARCH TEAM WITHIN GLOBAL HEALTH UGANDA AND MAKERERE UNIVERSITY, EXPANDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND PERSONNEL TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON NCI AFTER TBI. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BLOOD BIOMARKERS OF ACUTE BRAIN INJURY AND RISK FACTORS INCLUDING GLUCOSE ABNORMALITIES, CELLULAR INJURY, AND ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION MAY HELP IDENTIFY CHILDREN AT RISK OF NCI AFTER ACUTE TBI. OUR RESEARCH AND COLLABORATION AIMS ARE AS FOLLOWS: RESEARCH AIM 1 WILL DETERMINE IF BIOMARKERS AND RISK FACTORS OF BRAIN INJURY ELEVATED IN PEDIATRIC CM ARE ELEVATED IN PEDIATRIC TBI. WE WILL DETERMINE IF CHILDREN WITH MODERATE/SEVERE TBI (N=80) HAVE ELEVATED BIOMARKERS COMPARED TO MILD TBI (N=120) OR CONTROLS (N=100) AND IF THE BIOMARKERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH KNOWN RISK FACTORS OF BRAIN INJURY. AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE IF ELEVATED BRAIN INJURY BIOMARKERS IN PEDIATRIC TBI CORRELATE WITH NCI AT 6- MONTH FOLLOW-UP, TO BE ASSESSED USING: (1) K-ABC FOR OVERALL COGNITION AND WORKING MEMORY, (2) TOVA FOR ATTENTION, AND (3) BNIS-C FOR COGNITIVE FUNCTION SCREENING.

HOWEVER, 76% TO 85% OF PLHIV IN SSA RECEIVE NO TREATMENT FOR SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS, ESPECIALLY DEPRESSION. DEPRESSION REDUCES ART ADHERENCE, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS HEALTH AND INCREASES HIV TRANSMISSION RISKS. OLDER ADOLESCENTS (=14 YEARS) LIVING WITH HIV ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THESE RISKS AS CAREGIVERS WITHDRAW OR LESSEN THEIR SUPPORT DURING THEIR TRANSITION TO YOUNG ADULTHOOD. MOREOVER, OLDER ADOLESCENTS ARE ALSO MOVING INTO LARGER AND LESS ACCOMMODATING ADULT HIV CLINIC SETTINGS AND ARE AT RISK FOR DROPPING OUT OF ART PROGRAMS. GIVEN THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE SEVERELY UNDER EQUIPPED IN SSA, INCLUDING IN UGANDA, AND ARE INACCESSIBLE BY MANY YLHIV, NEW SOLUTIONS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND CLOSE THE TREATMENT GAP ARE URGENTLY NEEDED.

FOR THE PROPOSED R21/R33, WE WILL BUILD ON PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT WORK OF SENSING TECHNOLOGIES FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION TREATMENT IN LOW RESOURCE SETTINGS (STANDSTRONG) TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FUNCTIONALITY FOR POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION TREATMENT IN NEPAL. STANDSTRONG IS A DIGITAL PLATFORM CONSISTING OF TWO MOBILE APPS, INTERNET-OF-THINGS (IOT) PASSIVE SENSORS, AND A DATA ANALYSIS ENGINE BUILT USING MODERN MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES. STANDSTRONG INCORPORATES PASSIVE SENSING DATA COLLECTION FROM MOTHERS AND THEIR INFANTS THAT CAN BE MONITORED BY NON-SPECIALIST COUNSELORS AND THEN INCORPORATED TO BETTER PERSONALIZE PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT. FOR AIM 1 (R21 PHASE), WE WILL USE HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN TO ITERATIVELY REFINE THE STANDSTRONG PLATFORM AND ASSOCIATED IMPLEMENTATION MATERIAL. FOR AIM 2 (R21 PHASE), WE WILL EVALUATE THE STANDSTRONG PLATFORM AND ASSOCIATED CONTENTS ACCORDING TO ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY, USAGE, BENEFIT, AND VALIDITY. IF MILESTONES ARE MET FOR THE R21, WE WILL PROCEED TO THE R33 STAGE, IN WHICH WE WILL CONDUCT A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) COMPARING A PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT AS USUAL WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT SUPPLEMENTED BY THE STANDSTRONG PASSIVE SENSING PLATFORM WITH 112 DEPRESSED MOTHERS (56 IN EACH ARM). FOR AIM 3 (R33 PHASE), WE WILL IDENTIFY PARAMETERS FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND SCALABILITY THROUGH ENGAGEMENT OF POLICY, HEALTHCARE, AND TELECOM STAKEHOLDERS, AS WELL AS COSTING THE INTERVENTION AND BUILDING MHEALTH RESEARCH CAPACITY. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION CONTRIBUTES TO THE NIMH'S 2020 STRATEGIC PLAN TO TAILOR EXISTING INTERVENTIONS AND DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SERVICE DELIVER FOR DIVERSE POPULATIONS.

OUR OVERALL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MY MOBILE WALLET WILL OVERCOME BEHAVIORAL ISSUES, CRITICAL FINANCIAL AND MOTIVATIONAL ISSUES THAT CURRENTLY CONSTRAIN TB MEDICATION ADHERENCE. INNOVATION: TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, OUR STUDY IS THE FIRST TO ASSESS THE COMBINATION OF AN OBJECTIVELY MEASURED ADHERENCE, SMS REMINDERS, AND BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS-BASED INCENTIVES (DELIVERED VIA MOBILE MONEY) TO SUPPORT TB MEDICATION ADHERENCE. APPROACH: IN R21 AIM 1, WE FIRST DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL DESIGN AND DEVELOP MY MOBILE WALLET AS AN INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT TB MEDICATION ADHERENCE. USING USER-CENTERED APPROACHES, WE WILL ITERATIVELY CONDUCT FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH UP TO 30 TB PATIENTS RECRUITED FROM THE TB CLINIC IN MBARARA REGIONAL REFERRAL HOSPITAL (MRRH). WE THEN ASSESS THE INITIAL FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF USING MY MOBILE WALLET TO SUPPORT TB MEDICATION, IN R21 AIM 2 BASED ON 40 ADULTS WITH NEW DIAGNOSES OF ACTIVE, DRUG-SENSITIVE TB MRRH. FEASIBILITY WILL BE ASSESSED BY RECEIPT OF CASH TRANSFERS, SMS TEXTS RECEIVED, AND TECHNICAL PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED. ACCEPTABILITY WILL BE ASSESSED USING SYSTEM USABILITY AND INTERVIEWS BASED ON THE UNIFIED THEORY OF ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY. IN R33 AIM 1, WE FURTHER REFINE AND ADAPT MY MOBILE WALLET, AND THEN PILOT TEST IT IN 10 TB PATIENTS OVER TWO MONTHS OF TREATMENT TO ENSURE OPTIMAL FUNCTIONALITY. WE THEN ASSESS THE REFINED MY MOBILE WALLET INTERVENTION FOR LARGE-SCALE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND IMPACT ON TB TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES (IN R33 AIM 2) THROUGH A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL COMPOSED OF 162 TB PATIENTS FOLLOWED FOR 6 MONTHS. FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY WILL BE ASSESSED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IMPACT ASSESSMENT WILL BE BASED ON ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED MEDICATION ADHERENCE (PRIMARY), AS WELL AS TREATMENT COMPLETION, CLINIC ATTENDANCE, CURE RATES, AND MORTALITY (SECONDARY).

UP TO 75% OF CHILDHOOD HEARING LOSS IN LMICS IS PREVENTABLE DUE TO THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF INFECTION-RELATED HEARING LOSS. SCHOOL HEARING SCREENING IS CRITICAL FOR IDENTIFICATION OF CHILDHOOD HEARING LOSS IN LOW RESOURCE SETTINGS, WHERE NEWBORN SCREENING IS UNAVAILABLE. HOWEVER, MOST SCREENING PROGRAMS ONLY USE PURE-TONE SCREENING THAT DOES NOT IDENTIFY MIDDLE EAR DISEASE WIDESPREAD IN POPULATIONS WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE OF INFECTION-RELATED HEARING LOSS. THIS IS BECAUSE TYMPANOMETRY, USED TO CLINICALLY IDENTIFY MIDDLE EAR DISEASE, IS EXPENSIVE AND DESIGNED FOR TRAINED PROFESSIONALS. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE AN MHEALTH TYMPANOMETER WITH MACHINE LEARNING DIAGNOSTIC SUPPORT TO TRANSFORM THIS TECHNOLOGY INTO A LOW-COST TOOL THAT COULD BE BROADLY DISSEMINATED IN LMICS, WHERE THE BURDEN OF HEARING LOSS IS GREATEST AND IS NOT ADDRESSED BY CURRENT HEARING SCREENING METHODOLOGY. OUR STUDY TEAM IS COMPRISED OF INTERNATIONAL LEADERS IN HEARING LOSS, AUDIOLOGY, DATA SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, USER- CENTERED DESIGN, AND DEVICE DEVELOPMENT IN LMICS. WE HAVE ALSO PARTNERED WITH HEARX, A UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA SPINOUT COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED THE ONLY VALIDATED MHEALTH PURE-TONE SCREENING DEVICE. TO TEST THIS NEW DEVICE IN AN APPROPRIATE LMIC SETTING, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE SOUTH AFRICAN SITE FROM THE GLOBAL HEAR COLLABORATIVE, OUR CONSORTIUM OF COLLABORATORS FROM 28 COUNTRIES THAT IS THE ONLY INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH NETWORK DEDICATED TO HEARING LOSS.

HIV TRANSMISSION CONTINUES IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMIC), ESPECIALLY AMONG KEY AFFECTED POPULATIONS (KAP) AND IN SETTINGS OF HIGH STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION. IN MALAYSIA, A LMIC IN SE ASIA, HIV INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY IS INCREASING. HIV IS CONCENTRATED AMONG KAPS, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS (PWID), A GROUP THAT HAS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER ART PRESCRIPTION AND VIRAL SUPPRESSION (VS) LEVELS RELATIVE TO OTHER KAPS, UNDERMINING HIV TREATMENT AS PREVENTION (TASP) GOALS. PWID ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO OVERLAPPING AND INTERSECTIONAL STIGMAS DUE TO CRIMINALIZATION DRUG USE AND SEX WORK, EXPERIENCES WITH INCARCERATION, SOCIAL CLASS AND THE PRESENCE OF HIV ITSELF. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES CONFIRM HIGH LEVELS OF NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES, PREJUDICE AND STIGMA TOWARD PWID AMONG MEDICAL STUDENTS AND HIV EXPERTS, WITH CLEAR EVIDENCE OF INTENTION TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PWID BY WITHHOLDING ART PRESCRIPTION. STIGMA-REDUCING INTERVENTIONS HAVE MOSTLY CENTERED ON EDUCATIONAL AND CONTACT-BASED STRATEGIES. SUCH STRATEGIES, HOWEVER, APPEAR LESS EFFECTIVE WHERE STEREOTYPES AND STIGMA ARE DEEPLY ENTRENCHED, AS IN MALAYSIA, THUS REQUIRING THE INTRODUCTION AND TESTING OF ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES. BEHAVIORAL DESIGN INTERVENTIONS ARE POTENTIALLY EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS STIGMA IN SUCH SETTINGS. BEHAVIORAL DESIGN INTERVENTIONS USE TOOLS LIKE FRAMING, NUDGES, AND CHOICE ARCHITECTURE, WHICH CAN BE USED TO RE-DESIGN HOW PHYSICIANS BEHAVE \u2013 OR MAKE NON-DISCRIMINATORY HEALTHCARE DECISIONS. RAPID START ANTIRETROVIRAL (RS-ART) IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGY TO INITIATE ART IMMEDIATELY, THEREBY SUPPORTING TASP GOALS BY REDUCING TIME TO VS, ACHIEVING VS AND IMPROVING INDIVIDUAL HEALTH. IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED AMONG PWID. IT FITS THE CRITERIA FOR BEHAVIORAL DESIGN INTERVENTIONS BY RE-ARRANGING CLINICIAN DECISION-MAKING BY FIRST FOCUSING ON ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (I.E., PRESENCE OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS) RATHER THAN INACCURATE PERCEPTIONS OF ART ADHERENCE OR DESERVEDNESS. BEHAVIORAL DESIGN INTERVENTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED IN HIV STIGMA RESEARCH, NOR HAS THEY BEEN ASSESSED LONGITUDINALLY OR INFUSING CLINICALLY RELEVANT DYADS ANALYSES OF PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS. TO GUIDE THE BEHAVIORAL DESIGN OF RS-ART AMONG PWID, WE WILL USE THE DELPHI METHOD TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES. THEN WE WILL USE NOMINAL GROUP TECHNIQUE, A RANK-ORDERING MIXED METHOD STRATEGY TO ASSESS THE MULTI-LEVEL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO RS-ART FOR PWID, IN ORDER TO ADAPT EXISTING RS-ART PROTOCOLS FOR PWID.

THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF STIGMATIZATION ON THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE IT ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. THE INTERSECTION OF STIGMATIZED IDENTITIES AS MIGRANTS AND PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS (PWID), ALONG WITH STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH HIV INFECTION, CONTRIBUTES TO HIV RISK BEHAVIOR, POSES AS A BARRIER TO ACCESSING HIV TESTING AND OTHER PREVENTION/TREATMENT SERVICES, AND RESULTS IN POORER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THOSE LIVING WITH HIV.

LATIN AMERICA IS NO EXCEPTION. IN ADDITION TO HIGH LEVELS OF STIGMA TOWARD AND AMONG PLWH, THERE IS PERVASIVE STIGMA AGAINST THE KEY POPULATIONS IN WHICH HIV IS CONCENTRATED: YOUNG MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM) AND YOUNG TRANSGENDER WOMEN (TGW). MITIGATING HIV-RELATED STIGMA AS WELL AS OTHER STIGMAS THAT INTERSECT WITH HIV-RELATED STIGMA WILL BE CRITICAL TO MEETING TESTING AND TREATMENT TARGETS, AND IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES IN LATIN AMERICA. WE WILL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A SOCIAL MARKETING PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY FOR REDUCING HIV-RELATED STIGMA, AND ASSOCIATED INTERSECTIONAL STIGMA, AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IN AN URBAN LATIN AMERICAN SETTING.

CURRENTLY THERE ARE 0.5 MILLION OF PLWH LIVING IN THAILAND, WITH A HANDFUL OF POPULATIONS MORE VULNERABLE TO HIV, INCLUDING MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM) (9.2-40%), TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS (12%), SEX WORKERS (1-16%), AND SUBSTANCE USERS (19%). ALSO, THE OVERALL MORTALITY RATE AMONG THAI PLWH WAS 3.56%. THIS HIGH MORTALITY RATE EXPLAINED THE NOTABLE HIV TREATMENT CASCADE ISSUES IN THAILAND. AN IMPORTANT REASON IS HIV-RELATED STIGMA STILL POSES SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS FOR THAI PLWH TO ACCESS HEALTHCARE AND CARRY OUT HEALTH-PROTECTIVE BEHAVIORS TO ENGAGE IN CARE, INCLUDING ADHERENCE TO MEDICATIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO CULTURALLY ADAPT AND EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A 4 WEEKLY 2-HOUR GROUP-BASED STIGMA REDUCTION INTERVENTION PROTOCOL TO PROMOTE HEALTH ENGAGEMENT. THE SCIENTIFIC PREMISE IS, BUDDHIST-THAI CULTURE PROVIDES A UNIQUE CULTURAL CONTEXT FOR THAI PLWH TO UNDERSTAND HIV STIGMA AND SUFFERINGS. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THAI PLWH WILL DISPLAY LOWER INTERNAL STIGMA AND MORE CARE ENGAGEMENT FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL NEED TO OPTIMIZE CARE ENGAGEMENT THROUGH ADDRESSING HIV STIGMA WITHIN THE LOCAL CULTURAL CONTEXTS. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS COMPREHENSIVE, CULTURALLY-SENSITIVE STIGMA REDUCTION INTERVENTION FOR THAI PLWH. WE WILL CONDUCT A MIXED-METHODS STUDY WITH TWO STUDY PHASES. IN PHASE 1, WE WILL COLLECT QUALITATIVE DATA THROUGH CONDUCTING 30 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH THAI PLWH TO REVISE OUR CULTURAL CONCEPTUALIZATION OF STIGMA PROCESS. IN PHASE 2, WE WILL CONDUCT A PILOT RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF THE ADAPTED STIGMA REDUCTION INTERVENTION AMONG 80 THAI PLWH. INNOVATIONS INCLUDE: 1. PROPOSING A CULTURAL APPROACH TO EXAMINING HIV STIGMA AND INTERVENTION, TO INCREASE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY FOR PLWH IN THAILAND, AND ALLOW FOR GENERALIZABILITY OF FINDINGS TO OTHER PLWH POPULATIONS IN COUNTRIES INFLUENCED BY BUDDHIST CULTURE; AND 2. CONTRIBUTING TO FURTHER EXPANDING THE TOOLBOX OF INTERVENTIONS FOR HIV STIGMA REDUCTION, GIVEN MANY MODERN INTERVENTIONS HAVE ADAPTED PRINCIPLES OF BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY. AIMS ARE TO: 1. FOLLOW THE ADAPT-ITT MODEL TO CULTURALLY ADAPT AN EVIDENCE-BASED STIGMA REDUCTION INTERVENTION (PHASE 1). 2. EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY WITH A RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED TRIAL AMONG 80 THAI PLWH AND ASSESS OUTCOMES WITH BOTH SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES (PHASE 2). 3. REVISE AND FINALIZE THE STUDY PROTOCOLS FOR FUTURE PROJECT OPERATION BY DOCUMENTING EMERGING DIFFICULTIES AND SOLUTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS PILOT PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.

A KEY REASON FOR THIS EVIDENCE GAP IS THE DIFFICULTY IN DETECTING THESE PATHOGENS DUE TO THE POOR SENSITIVITY OF BACTERIAL CULTURE, WHICH IS PARTICULARLY A PROBLEM FOR SHIGELLA AND CAMPYLOBACTER. THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF QUANTITATIVE, CULTURE-INDEPENDENT MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS FOR THESE PATHOGENS HAS SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN BURDEN OF DISEASE AND IS POISED TO DO THE SAME FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BROADER ECOLOGY OF THESE PATHOGENS. SHIGELLA AND CAMPYLOBACTER ARE MODEL ORGANISMS TO INTERROGATE TRANSMISSION ECOLOGY BECAUSE THEY LIE ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE CONTINUUM OF PERSON-TO-PERSON (SHIGELLA) VERSUS ENVIRONMENTAL (CAMPYLOBACTER) TRANSMISSION. THE INCLUSION OF BOTH IN THIS PROJECT PROVIDES A RANGE OF LIKELY TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS FROM WHICH WE CAN ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ENTERIC PATHOGEN TRANSMISSION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THEREFORE TO UNDERSTAND THE SOURCES AND ROUTES OF TRANSMISSION OF ENTERIC PATHOGENS IN AN URBAN LOW-RESOURCE SETTING IN DHAKA, BANGLADESH USING CULTURE-INDEPENDENT METHODS FOR DETECTION. WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS BY USING A SYSTEMS-DYNAMIC MODELING APPROACH TO ANALYZE PATHOGEN DETECTION DATA GENERATED IN A HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL LONGITUDINAL STUDY. THE TRANSMISSION COHORT WILL INCLUDE STRUCTURED OBSERVATIONS TO QUANTIFY HUMAN CONTACTS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AND BROAD SAMPLING OF HOUSEHOLD CONTACTS, ANIMAL RESERVOIRS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT TO IDENTIFY AND ATTRIBUTE SOURCES FOR INDEX INFECTIONS. VIABILITY PCR WILL BE USED TO DIFFERENTIATE NUCLEIC ACID FROM VIABLE ORGANISMS, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO DIRECTLY MEASURE THE DURATION OF SHEDDING OF TRANSMISSIBLE PATHOGEN AFTER ILLNESS AND ESTABLISH QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS FOR INFERRING VIABLE PATHOGEN FROM A WIDE RANGE OF SAMPLES. THESE DATA WILL THEN BE USED TO PARAMETERIZE TWO COMPLEMENTARY MATHEMATICAL MODELS, A HOUSEHOLD DYNAMICS AND ENDEMIC INCIDENCE MODEL, TO INTERROGATE THE INTERDEPENDENCE AND RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PERSON-TO-PERSON AND ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS. PATHOGENS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED TO THE GENOME LEVEL USING HYBRID ASSEMBLY FROM SHORT- AND LONG-READ METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING OF A SUBSET OF STOOL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES. THIS PROJECT WILL TRANSFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ENTERIC PATHOGEN TRANSMISSION BY MOVING FROM A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF FECAL-ORAL TRANSMISSION ROUTES TO PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLD AND ENVIRONMENTAL PATHWAYS OF HIGHEST RELEVANCE. IN ENDEMIC AND URBAN SETTINGS, THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIRECT HOUSEHOLD CONTACT VERSUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FOR TRANSMISSION OF BOTH SHIGELLA AND CAMPYLOBACTER IS UNKNOWN, AND OUR MODELING

A LACK OF POST-MORTEM STUDIES IN LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES PREVENTS IN-DEPTH STUDIES ON TISSUE FROM CONFIRMED MENINGITIS PATIENTS. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) CO-INFECTION FREQUENTLY OCCURS IN HIV-ASSOCIATED MENINGITIS, BUT NO STUDY HAS INVESTIGATED ITS IMPACT ON MORTALITY. TUBERCULOUS MENINGITIS (TBM), ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF HIV-ASSOCIATED MENINGITIS, LACKS A SENSITIVE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) LATERAL FLOW ASSAY TO SERVE AS A SIMPLE POINT OF CARE DIAGNOSTIC. THE BEST CANDIDATE LIPID BIOMARKER FOR A POINT OF CARE ASSAY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. BEST PRACTICES AND EXPERTISE FOR CSF AND BRAIN TISSUE HANDLING, PROCESSING, AND ANALYSES ARE ALSO LACKING IN MANY SUB- SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH CAUSES OF MORTALITY, OPTIMAL DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS, AND LABORATORY EXPERTISE TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES OF HIV-ASSOCIATED MENINGITIS. WE WILL TEST THE FOLLOWING SET OF SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1) ESTABLISH COMPREHENSIVE ETIOLOGIES OF HIV-ASSOCIATED MENINGITIS AIM 2) TO IMPROVE CSF DIAGNOSTICS FOR PATIENTS WITH HIV-ASSOCIATED MENINGITIS IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS, WE WILL EXPLORE MORE OPTIMAL CANDIDATE CSF LIPID BIOMARKERS TO DIAGNOSE TBM. AIM 3) STRENGTHEN LABORATORY SERVICES TO IMPROVE THE DIAGNOSIS OF MENINGITIS THE APPROACH IS INNOVATIVE, BECAUSE IT SYSTEMATICALLY USES POST-MORTEM TISSUE FROM AN ENDEMIC SETTING TO EVALUATE HIV-ASSOCIATED MENINGITIS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO ESTABLISH ETIOLOGIES AND DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS IN HIV-ASSOCIATED MENINGITIS WHILE IMPROVING THE LABORATORY CAPABILITY IN ZAMBIA TO DIAGNOSE CNS INFECTIONS.

IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES TO REDUCE VASCULAR RISK IN LOW-AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS) WILL MEET A GLOBAL GOAL OF REDUCING CHRONIC DISEASE DEATH RATES BY AN ADDITIONAL 2% PER YEAR, WITH ONLY A MODERATE RISE IN HEALTH EXPENDITURES. GHANA IS A LMIC IN SSA WITH A PROFOUND LACK OF HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH CARE COORDINATION FOR STROKE SURVIVORS, ESPECIALLY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED SECONDARY PREVENTION THERAPIES.

THEREFORE, THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF STROKE MINIMIZATION THROUGH ADDITIVE ANTI-ATHEROSCLEROTIC AGENTS IN ROUTINE TREATMENT II (SMAART-II) STUDY IS TO DEPLOY A HYBRID STUDY DESIGN TO 1) DEMONSTRATE THE EFFICACY OF A POLYPILL (POLYCAP \u00ae) CONTAINING FIXED DOSES OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVES, A STATIN, AND ANTIPLATELET THERAPY TAKEN AS TWO CAPSULES, ONCE DAILY ORALLY IN REDUCING COMPOSITE VASCULAR RISK OVER 24 MONTHS VS.

DESPITE THE FACT THAT ~70% OF PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY (PWE) RESPOND TO MEDICATION THERAPY, EPILEPSY REMAINS UNTREATED IN UP TO 9 IN 10 PATIENTS IN AFRICA, LEADING TO BRAIN DAMAGE AND ASSOCIATED SEQUELAE. IN ADDITION, EPILEPSY BEARS A HEAVY PSYCHOSOCIAL BURDEN DUE TO ITS STIGMA, PREVENTING MANY PWE FROM SEEKING CARE AND LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC HARM. INTERESTINGLY, GENETIC CAUSES OF EPILEPSY ARE BEING INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED, DRIVEN BY THE BOOM IN NEXT GENERATION DNA SEQUENCING (NGS). HOWEVER, THE VAST MAJORITY OF GENETIC RESEARCH HAS IGNORED POPULATIONS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.

THE INFANT HAS TO SWITCH FROM RELYING ON THE PLACENTA FOR OXYGEN TO USING ITS LUNGS FOR THE FIRST TIME. WORLDWIDE EACH YEAR, 10 MILLION BABIES DO NOT BREATHE IMMEDIATELY AT BIRTH, AND APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION BABIES DIE ANNUALLY IN LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES DUE TO A BRAIN INJURY CAUSED BY INADEQUATE BLOOD FLOW AND OXYGEN DELIVERY TO THE NEONATAL BRAIN, A CONDITION KNOWN AS HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (HIE). THE USUAL PRACTICE FOR INFANTS WHO NEED RESUSCITATION IS TO IMMEDIATELY CLAMP THE UMBILICAL CORD. ANIMAL STUDIES SHOW THAT CLAMPING THE CORD BEFORE THE BABY BREATHES CAN CAUSE THE HEART BEAT TO SLOW AND CAN DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD BEING PUMPED OUT OF THE HEART EACH MINUTE. WE PROPOSE A STUDY TO SEE IF UMBILICAL CORD MILKING (UCM) FOR THOSE INFANTS WHO NEED RESUSCITATION IS BETTER THAN IMMEDIATELY CLAMPING AND CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD AT BIRTH. WE WONDER IF IT WILL REDUCE DEATH AND/OR HIE. IN ADDITION, IT MAY REDUCE DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS IN SURVIVORS BY TWO YEARS OF AGE. THIS STUDY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NEED FOR RESUSCITATION, NEITHER UCM OR DELAYED CORD CLAMPING, ARE RECOMMENDED BY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE. YET, SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES FROMAROUND THE WORLD HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT INFANTS NEEDING RESUSCITATION ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE OR DEVELOP CONDITIONS SUCH AS CEREBRAL PALSY, AUTISM AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS. THE LARGE AMOUNT OF FETAL BLOOD LEFT IN THE PLACENTA AFTER IMMEDIATE CORD CLAMPING MEANS THAT THE BABY GETS LESS BLOOD FOR THE BRAIN, LUNGS, AND HEART, WHICH CAN CONTRIBUTE, TO BRAIN INJURY AND EVEN DEATH. CORD MILKING AT BIRTH MAY HELP TO PROTECT THESE INFANTS BY INCREASING THE TRANSFER OF BLOOD VOLUME. OUR PRIOR WORK HAS SHOWN THAT, COMPARED TO IMMEDIATE CORD CLAMPING, UCM RESULTS IN BETTER HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, LESS EARLY ANEMIA, AND MORE OXYGEN IN THE BRAIN. NO HARM FROM UCM HAS BEEN NOTED IN TERM INFANTS IN ANY STUDIES.

TO THAT END, THE PROJECT SEEKS TO INITIATE A SERIES OF RESEARCH CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES AND DEVELOP A NEW, POPULATION-BASED, LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY OF ADRD AND RELATED AGE-ASSOCIATED CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS IN THIS POPULATION. POPULATION AGING IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE COMMON IN MANY LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMIC). AS A RESULT, THESE COUNTRIES FACE THE GROWING BURDEN OF COMMON AGE-ASSOCIATED CHRONIC ILLNESSES, INCLUDING ADRD. NEPAL IS A LOW MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRY WHERE THE POPULATION IS NOW AGING, PUTTING A RISING NUMBER OF ADULTS AT RISK OF DEVELOPING ADRD. THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO RESEARCH CAPACITY IN NEPAL TO INVESTIGATE THE SCOPE AND PRIMARY DETERMINANTS OF ADRD, AND EVEN THE MOST BASIC INFORMATION ON ADRD IS CURRENTLY LACKING. SUCH INFORMATION IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PREVENTION STRATEGIES AND REDUCE THE BURDEN OF ADRD IN THIS COUNTRY. CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES WILL FOCUS ON TRAINING IN SURVEY DATA COLLECTION METHODS WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON ASCERTAINMENT OF ADRD AND STATISTICAL METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX DATA FROM LONGITUDINAL PANEL SURVEYS.

YET, SEVERAL KEY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF ADRD, SUCH AS YEARS OF EDUCATION, ARE COMPLETED EARLIER IN THE LIFECOURSE AND ARE THUS UNAMENABLE TO CHANGE IN OLDER AGE. IN PARALLEL, GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ENGAGING IN COGNITIVELY STIMULATING ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE LIFECOURSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED COGNITION AND OVERALL HEALTH. THESE DATA PUT FORWARD A COMPELLING HYPOTHESIS THAT LATE LIFE LEARNING (LLL, NON-FORMAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE FORMAL CREDENTIALED LEARNING) MAY PROVIDE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY, IN OLDER AGE, TO MITIGATE ADRD RISK BY PROVIDING PROSPECTS FOR INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT. YET, VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE BENEFITS OF LLL. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO PINPOINT HOW WE CAN INTERVENE TO PREVENT OR DELAY ADRD, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-RESOURCED SETTINGS WHERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGED AGING ARE LIMITED SUCH AS IN LEBANON, A LOW TO MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRY (LMIC). LEBANON HAS THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF OLDER ADULTS IN THE ARAB REGION, AND LEBANESE OLDER ADULTS ARE EXPOSED TO A HOST OF LIFECOURSE PSYCHOSOCIAL ADVERSITIES (E.G., WAR STRESSORS, FINANCIAL HARDSHIP) ALL OF WHICH WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE ADRD RISK. THE CURRENT PROJECT MOVES TOWARDS OUR LONG-TERM GOAL BY PROPOSING AN INNOVATIVE STUDY IN WHICH WE CAPITALIZE ON AN ONGOING LLL PROGRAM AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT, THE UNIVERSITY FOR SENIORS (UFS), TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF LLL ON COGNITIVE AND OVERALL HEALTH. THE UFS HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR THE LAST 11 YEARS AND ITS REGISTRY INCLUDES 1,300 PARTICIPANTS, PROVIDING A WELL-ESTABLISHED PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO LAUNCH OUR STUDY.

CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: MY LONG-TERM CAREER GOAL IS TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENTLY FUNDED RESEARCHER WITH EXPERTISE IN PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY (EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) TO INFORM IMPROVED STRATEGIES FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINED VIRAL SUPPRESSION IN HIV TREATMENT. IN THE SHORT-TERM DURING THIS K43 PERIOD, MY GOALS ARE TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT OF PLWH IN THE IEDEA WEST AFRICA DATABASE AND DETERMINE THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PREDICTORS OF HIV-1, HIV-2 LOW-LEVEL VIREMIA (LLV) IN THE COHORT; AND TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOW-LEVEL VIREMIA (LLV) AND ADHERENCE TO ART IN A PROSPECTIVE COHORT USING 3 DIFFERENT ADHERENCE MEASURES (PHARMACY REFILL RECORDS (PRR), INNOVATIVE URINE-TENOFOVIR POC TEST, AND INNOVATIVE TFV-DP IN DBS). TO ATTAIN THESE GOALS, I WILL BE MENTORED DURING THIS K43 AWARD PERIOD BY A GROUP OF EXPERIENCED CAREER SCIENTISTS: DR. CECILE LAHIRI, A CLINICIAN SCIENTIST WHOSE FOCUS IS ON HIV CURE/ERADICATION; DR. OLIVER EZECHI, A SPECIALIST IN REPRODUCTIVE AND POPULATION HEALTH WHOSE FOCUS IS ON THE CLINICAL IMPACT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES ON WOMEN AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH; DR ANTOINE JAQUET, A CLINICIAN/EPIDEMIOLOGIST WITH FOCUS ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV AND RELATED CHRONIC COMORBIDITIES; DR. IGHO OFOTOKUN AN HIV TRANSLATIONAL CLINICIAN SCIENTIST WITH FOCUS ON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH AND DR. CASTILLO-MANCILLA, A TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCHER FOCUSED ON APPLIED CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. FOR THIS K43 AWARD, I WILL COMPLETE COURSEWORK AND HANDS-ON TRAINING IN LARGE DATA ANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY, I WILL ALSO CONDUCT RESEARCH THAT EXEMPLIFIES THE UNDETECTABLE = UNTRANSMISSIBLE (U=U) AGENDA WITH THE GOAL OF LEARNING NEW WAYS OF MONITORING ADHERENCE TO ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE HIV TREATMENTS THAT WILL STOP TRANSMISSION AND ELIMINATE HIV EVENTUALLY. MERGING MY BACKGROUND IN PHARMACY PRACTICE IN HIV CARE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, WITH ADVANCED ANALYTIC SKILLS, MATHEMATICAL MODELLING, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY FROM THIS K43, WILL GIVE ME THE CAPACITY FOR A CAREER AS AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER. RESEARCH PLAN: EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT PERSISTENT LOW-LEVEL VIREMIA (LLV) IN PERSONS WITH HIV (PLWH) ON ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) IS A BARRIER TO ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF ZERO TRANSMISSION AND ERADICATION OF HIV1-8, BUT NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF LLV ON ATTAINING THE GOAL OF VIRAL SUPPRESSION IN WEST AFRICA; THUS, THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION VITAL TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF LLV IN ART OUTCOMES IN WEST AFRICA. IT WILL ALSO BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IF DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN HIV-1 AND HIV-2 TREATMENT OUTCOMES IN THE PRESENCE OF LLV, SINCE WEST AFRICA IS ONE OF THE FEW REGIONS IN THE WORLD WHERE HIV-2 IS ENDEMIC. WHILE LITERATURE IS UNANIMOUS THAT SUB-OPTIMAL ADHERENCE RESULTS IN LLV, CONTROVERSY SURROUNDS THE PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF LLV FOR CLINICAL OUTCOMES. SOME STUDIES ATTRIBUTE THE CAUSE OF LLV TO DRUG RESISTANCE AND REACTIVATION OF VIRAL RESERVOIRS, BUT OTHER STUDIES NAME THESE FACTORS AS CONSEQUENCES OF LLV9-11. THE \u2018UNDETECTABLE=UNTRANSMISSIBLE (U=U)\u2019 CONCEPT IS HINGED ON EXPLORING PHARMACOLOGIC, PSYCHO- SOCIO-ECONOMIC, AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE ADHERENCE AND ACHIEVE UNDETECTABLE VIRAL LOAD12,13. INDIVIDUALS WITH LLV HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY TO SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVE COMPLETE UNDETECTABLE VIRAL LOAD. THE UPPER LIMIT OF LLV (200-1000 COPIES/ML), HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH VIROLOGIC FAILURE, DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE TO ARVS, AIDS EVENTS AND AIDS-RELATED DEATHS1. CURRENT WHO GUIDELINES DO NOT ADVISE MONITORING OR TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS EVEN AFTER REPEATED MEASUREMENTS OF LOW-LEVEL VIRAEMIA. CONSEQUENTLY, PATIENTS ARE KEPT ON FAILING ART REGIMENS. NON-MONITORING OF LLV MAY RESULT IN AN EPIDEMIC OF RESISTANCE TO CURRENTLY USED ANTIRETROVIRALS AND POOR CLINICAL PROGNOSIS IN PLWH. THUS, IT IS VITAL TO UNDERSTAND THE PREDICTORS OF LLV AND ITS IMPACT ON PLWH, TO INFORM IMPROVED CLINICAL CARE OF PLWH. OUR PROPOSED AIMS ARE: 1). TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE A COHORT OF FROM THE IEDEA WEST AFRICA DATABASE AND DETERMINE THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PREDICTORS OF LOW-LEVEL VIREMIA (LLV) IN THE COHORT (FOR HIV-1 AND HIV-2) AND II).

TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE WILL ASSESS THE PREVALENCE OF LLV IN A LARGE WEST AFRICAN DATABASE (IEDEA WEST AFRICA) AND ALSO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADHERENCE WITH LOW-LEVEL VIREMIA (LLV) IN A COHORT OF 272 PLWH IN LAGOS, NIGERIA AND PREDICT FUTURE LLV.

WHILE THIS IS A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT, NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES SUCH AS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) NOW ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN PLWH. POOR HTN MEDICATION ADHERENCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH UNCONTROLLED BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) AND INCREASED RISK OF CVD EVENTS SUCH AS MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. DESPITE THIS RISK, MEDICATION ADHERENCE RESEARCH IN PLWH IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ART WITH LIMITED FOCUS ON ADHERENCE TO OTHER CHRONIC COMORBIDITIES. MEDICATION ADHERENCE IS A COMPLEX HEALTH BEHAVIOUR THAT IS DRIVEN BY CONFLUENCE OF FACTORS THAT OPERATE AT MICRO- AND MACRO-LEVELS. AS PEOPLE AGE WITH HIV, THEIR NEEDS INCREASE BEYOND SOLELY MANAGING HIV MEDICATION ADHERENCE, TO INCLUDE MANAGEMENT OF OTHER CONDITIONS AND THEIR MEDICATIONS. INCREASED PILL BURDEN FACED BY OLDER ADULTS LIVING WITH HIV (OALWH) WITH HTN, COUPLED WITH DECLINE IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION, COST OF TRANSPORTATION TO THE FACILITY TO GET MEDICATION REFILL AND LACK OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WORSEN ADHERENCE.

THE RESEARCH GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO CONDUCT A RIGOROUS PROOF-OF-CONCEPT EVALUATION TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, PRELIMINARY EFFECTIVENESS, AND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF PEER DELIVERED HIV AND SYPHILIS SELF-TESTING COUPLED WITH ASSISTED PARTNER NOTIFICATION SERVICES. MEN WHO ENGAGE IN SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH OTHER MEN (MSM) ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HIV AND SYPHILIS.

SYPHILIS AND HIV TRANSMISSION SHARE COMMON TRANSMISSION ROUTES AND SYPHILIS INCREASES RISK OF HIV ACQUISITION, TRANSMISSION, AND DISEASE PROGRESSION. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION RECOMMENDS DUAL HIV/SYPHILIS TESTING FOR MSM, BUT UPTAKE OF FACILITY-BASED TESTING IS LOW BECAUSE OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTHCARE SETTINGS.

HAT IS OF GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERNS DUE TO THE LACK OF HOPE FOR PREVENTION BY VACCINATION AND THE UNSATISFACTORY TREATMENT OPTIONS. THERE IS NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DRUGS WITH NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION. TO RATIONALLY DEVELOP A GOOD DRUG, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY MOLECULAR TARGETS IN THE PARASITES. THESE TARGET MOLECULES SHOULD FULFILL THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (I) IMPORTANT FOR THE PARASITES\u2019 SURVIVAL, (II) ABSENT IN HUMANS OR NOT IMPORTANT IN HUMANS, AND (III) IF PRESENT IN HUMANS, IT SHOULD BE STRUCTURALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE HUMAN MOLECULE. AFTER WHICH WE CAN THEN SEARCH FOR CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THAT CAN SPECIFICALLY INTERACT WITH THE TARGET MOLECULES TO STOP THEM FROM FUNCTIONING, AND EVENTUALLY KILLING THE PARASITES. THE ENERGY (ATP) METABOLISM PATHWAY OF BLOOD STREAM FORMS OF THE TRYPANOSOMES (BSFS) PRESENTS SUCH A NOVEL TARGET FOR DRUG DISCOVERY BECAUSE IT DIFFERS FROM THAT OF ANIMALS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO INTERESTING TARGET PROTEINS IN THE PARASITES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THEIR ENERGY GENERATION AND SURVIVAL IN THE HUMAN HOST; THESE ARE THE TRYPANOSOMAL ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE (TAO) AND GLYCEROL KINASE (TGK). HOWEVER, BOTH ENZYMES MUST BE SIMULTANEOUSLY BLOCKED IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY KILL THE PARASITES AND CURE THE INFECTION.

THIS WILL AVOID THE CHANCES OF DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION VERSUS UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECT THAT READILY ACCOMPANIES ADMINISTRATION OF MULTIPLE DRUGS TO TREAT A DISEASE.

IN PARALLEL, THE COMPOUNDS WILL ALSO BE SCREENED AGAINST THE PARASITE FOR IDENTIFYING THOSE WITH TRYPANOSOMES KILLING EFFECTS. BOTH CATEGORY OF COMPOUNDS WILL THEN BE OPTIMIZED FOR KILLING THE TRYPANOSOMES IN CULTURE, FOR INHIBITION OF TAO AND TGK, AND FOR LACK OF EFFECTS ON HUMAN GLYCEROL KINASE AND CULTURED HUMAN CELLS.

IN BOTH STUDIES, THESE SUBTYPES DIFFER IN RESPECT TO PATHOGENIC MECHANISMS, CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND SURVIVAL OUTCOMES. ALTHOUGH THESE STUDIES REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DLBCL FROM THE US AND EUROPE, THERE IS MUCH WORK STILL TO BE DONE IN DESCRIBING THE GENETIC PATTERNS OF DLBCL IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, ESPECIALLY IN PATIENTS WITH HIV. FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF GENETIC AND TRANSCRIPTIONAL HETEROGENEITY OF THESE LYMPHOMAS COULD INFORM NEW DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT APPROACHES THAT IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. THE SCIENTIFIC GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH A BIOLOGICALLY INFORMED TAXONOMY OF HIV-ASSOCIATED DLBCL IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO: (1) ESTABLISH GENETICALLY AND TRANSCRIPTIONALLY DEFINED SUBTYPES OF HIV-ASSOCIATED DLBCL IN SOUTH AFRICA; AND (2) ESTABLISH CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF HIV-ASSOCIATED DLBCL ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SUBSETS. THIS PROPOSAL IS RESPONSIVE TO AREAS OF CRITICAL NEED IN SOUTH AFRICA: RESEARCH THAT IS HIGHLY RELEVANT TO REGIONAL HEALTH PRIORITIES; AND THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT OF A LOCAL CLINICIAN-SCIENTIST. THESE STUDIES ALSO SUPPORT THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF DEVELOPING LOW-COST DIAGNOSTIC STRATEGIES THAT GUIDE THE TREATMENT OF LYMPHOMA IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE PROJECT PI, DR KATHERINE ANTEL, IS A CLINICAL HEMATOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN WITH THE CAREER GOAL OF INDEPENDENTLY CONDUCTING RESEARCH THAT WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA. HER PHD WORK SHOWED THAT IN SOUTH AFRICA THERE ARE NUMEROUS LOCAL OBSTACLES TO LYMPHOMA DIAGNOSIS AND, NOTABLY, THAT WITHIN THIS TUBERCULOSIS (TB)- ENDEMIC AREA, PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA ARE AT HIGH RISK OF MISDIAGNOSIS WITH EXTRAPULMONARY TB. THE DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM DEVELOPED AS PART OF HER RESEARCH HAS LED TO A SHORTER TIME-TO-DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPHOMA AT GROOTE SCHUUR HOSPITAL. A COMPREHENSIVE CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN COMPRISING STRUCTURED ACTIVITIES AND MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WILL ENABLE DR ANTEL TO CONTINUE HER CAREER DEVELOPMENT AS A PHYSICIAN-SCIENTIST BY ACQUIRING ADVANCED SKILLS IN 1) NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING; 2) BIOINFORMATICS; 3) BIOSTATISTICAL APPROACHES FOR INTEGRATING GENOMICS AND CLINICAL DATASETS; AND 4) CELLULAR AND IN VIVO APPROACHES TO INTERROGATE THE EFFECTS OF NOVEL GENE MUTATIONS.

GLOBALLY, AN ESTIMATED 257 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE WITH CHRONIC HBV INFECTION (2015) WHILE, IN 2019, 38 MILLION PEOPLE WERE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV). AFRICA, IN PARTICULAR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA), IS THE MOST AFFECTED REGION IN THE WORLD WITH AND 70% (25.7 MILLION) OF PLHIV AND ~6% OF THE ADULT POPULATION INFECTED WITH HBV. IMPORTANTLY, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT CHRONIC HBV INFECTION AFFECTS 5-20% OF PLHIV. HBV IS AN ASYMPTOMATIC LIVER DISEASE MAKING ITS EARLY DETECTION DIFFICULT AND LEADING TO SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS CIRRHOSIS, HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, AND EARLY DEATH. KNOWLEDGE OF HBV STATUS AT INITIATION OF HIV ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) IS ESSENTIAL FOR APPROPRIATE SELECT AN INITIAL ART REGIMEN, AS TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE (TDF) SHOULD BE COMBINED WITH LAMIVUDINE (3TC) OR EMTRICITABINE (FTC), WHICH SUPPRESS BOTH HIV AND HBV REPLICATION, AND FOR MONITORING TREATMENT.

IN THESE AREAS, EXPOSURE TO AFB1 STARTS EARLY IN LIFE THROUGH MATERNAL ROUTES DURING PREGNANCY. POPULATIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES EXPERIENCE EARLY ONSET OF HCC, AND IN UTERO AFB1 EXPOSURE MAY BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE ONSET OF THE DISEASE. EXPOSURES TO NUTRIENTS, TOXIC CHEMICALS AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS DURING GESTATION AND EARLY CHILDHOOD PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN DETERMINING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DISEASES LATER IN LIFE. THE MECHANISM OF EARLY ONSET OF CARCINOGENESIS MAY INCLUDE EPIGENETIC CHANGES IN TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES (TSGS). OUR PREVIOUS RODENT STUDY SHOWED THAT IN UTERO AFB1 EXPOSURE CAN ALTER DNA METHYLATION OF TSGS. IT IS NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF IN UTERO AFB1 EXPOSURE ON METHYLATION AND EXPRESSION OF TSGS IN HUMANS. THE OVERALL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT IN UTERO AFB1 EXPOSURE WILL DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATE TSGS, AND THIS METHYLATION WILL INVERSELY CORRELATE WITH THE EXPRESSION OF THE TSGS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ESTABLISH A PRE-BIRTH COHORT AND STUDY THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN IN UTERO EXPOSURE TO AFB1 AND DNA METHYLATION CHANGES IN TSGS OF NEWBORNS IN NIGERIA.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES IN THIS APPLICATION ARE TO (I) CHARACTERIZE THE INFLUENCE OF DIET ON SPECIFIC HISTONE MODIFICATIONS AND GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES IN THE BLADDER AND (II) RELATE ANY OBSERVED ALTERATIONS IN HISTONES AND GENE EXPRESSION TO PHENOTYPIC AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN THE BLADDER. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE MOLECULAR CHANGES UNDERLYING ALTERATIONS IN BLADDER MORPHOLOGY AND FUNCTION WITH DIFFERENT DIETS. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROJECT IS THAT IDENTIFICATION OF THE EPIGENETIC EFFECTS OF DIET IN THE BLADDER WILL PROVIDE A FOUNDATION, AND SUPPORTIVE PRELIMINARY DATA, FOR SUBSEQUENT STUDIES ON THE ROLES PLAYED BY DIET IN THE NORMAL BLADDER AND IN BLADDER DYSFUNCTION.

THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE PROPOSED K43 APPLICATION IS TO COMPLEMENT MY CLINICAL BACKGROUND IN PSYCHIATRY WITH ADVANCED COURSEWORK AND FOCUSED MENTORING IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AND DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE TRANSITION IN CARE. THIS TRAINING WILL ENABLE ME TO ACHIEVE MY SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE: TO DEVELOP AND TEST A SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION FOR ALHIV TRANSITIONING TO ADULT HIV CARE. THIS TRAINING WILL ENABLE ME TO ACHIEVE MY SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE: TO DEVELOP AND TEST A SELF- MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION FOR ALHIV. THIS APPLICATION PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION FOR ALHIV TRANSITIONING TO ADULT HIV CARE AND TEST THE IMPACTS OF THE INTERVENTION ON HIV OUTCOMES. CONDUCTING THE PROPOSED STUDIES IN THIS APPLICATION WILL COMPLEMENT MY PRIOR TRAINING IN PSYCHIATRY WHILE FILLING KEY GAPS IN THREE AREAS: (A) BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE THEORIES AND THEIR APPLICATION TO BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, (B) ADAPTATION AND DESIGN OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, AND (C) TESTING OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS THROUGH RANDOMIZED TRIALS. TO FILL THESE GAPS, I WILL CONDUCT QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TO ELABORATE A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE BARRIERS FACED BY ALHIV TRANSITIONING TO ADULT HIV CARE IN UGANDA (AIM 1), DEVELOP A SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION THAT WILL ENABLE ALHIV TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO ADULT HIV CARE (AIM 2), AND ASSESS FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFECTS OF THE SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION ON HIV OUTCOMES FOR ALHIV TRANSITIONING TO ADULT HIV CARE (AIM 3). THIS STUDY WILL BE THE FIRST TO DEVELOP A SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION TARGETING THE CRITICAL TRANSITION PERIOD FROM PEDIATRIC TO ADULT HIV CARE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AND THE FIRST TO USE A RANDOMIZED DESIGN TO TEST THE EFFECT OF A SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION ON HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG ALHIV IN UGANDA WHO ARE TRANSITIONING TO ADULT HIV CARE. THESE FINDINGS WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT BY OPTIMIZING HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR A KEY POPULATION IN THE GLOBAL HIV EPIDEMIC. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A COMPETITIVE R01 GRANT PROPOSAL, SUBMITTED IN YEAR 4, TO CONDUCT A FULLY-POWERED, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE RETENTION IN CARE AND VIRAL SUPPRESSION AMONG ALHIV IN UGANDA WHO ARE NAVIGATING THE CRITICAL PERIOD OF TRANSITION TO ADULT HIV CARE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "UGA", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0be356c5-ccd3-efa8-a56e-97fd6d85451e-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K43TW011929_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140059451, "Award ID": "K43TW011926", "Award Amount": 278679.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-17", "CFDA Number": "93.989", "Description": "PREVALENCE AND TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF CLONAL MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RISK OF HEMATOLOGICAL CANCER IN A COHORT OF CLINICALLY HEALTHY NIGERIANS - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THE BURDEN OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES, ESPECIALLY HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES (CVDS), IS RISING IN AFRICA. CLONAL HEMATOPOIESIS OF INDETERMINATE POTENTIAL (CHIP) IS AN AGE-RELATED RISK FACTOR FOR ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY, BLOOD CANCER AND CVDS, PROMPTING HUGE INTERESTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS TARGETING CHIP MUTATIONS TO INTERCEPT PROGRESSION TO MALIGNANCIES. HOWEVER, INDIVIDUALS OF AFRICAN DESCENT ARE A MINORITY IN THESE CHIP STUDIES HENCE THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SPECTRUM AND FREQUENCY OF CHIP VARIANTS IN AFRICAN POPULATIONS. MY LONG-TERM RESEARCH GOAL IS TO GENERATE A PAN-AFRICAN DATABASE OF SOMATIC MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RISK OF DEVELOPING MYELOID LEUKEMIA. RECENT GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION ANALYSES HAVE IDENTIFIED GERMLINE LOCI PREDISPOSING INDIVIDUALS TO INCREASED RISK OF CHIP ACQUISITION. THESE INCLUDE THE RS144418061 INTERGENIC VARIANT NEAR TET2 FOUND ONLY IN AFRICAN-ANCESTRY POPULATIONS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THERE IS A HIGH BURDEN OF CHIP VARIANTS IN NORMAL-AGING AFRICANS COMPARED TO AGE-MATCHED HEALTHY CAUCASIANS. TO ADDRESS THIS, I PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1 DETERMINES THE FREQUENCY OF CHIP MUTATIONS IN A COHORT OF CLINICALLY HEALTHY NIGERIANS. WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLES FROM HEALTHY NIGERIAN VOLUNTEERS =40 YEARS WILL BE COLLECTED AND ERROR-CORRECTED TARGETED SEQUENCING WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO GENOTYPE 54 GENES KNOWN TO BE FREQUENTLY MUTATED IN MYELOID MALIGNANCIES. AIM 2 DESCRIBES TEMPORAL TRENDS AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF CHIP ACQUISITION OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. EACH SUBJECT WILL BE FOLLOWED UP FOR THREE YEARS AND THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF CHIP CLONAL DOMINANCE OVER THE PERIOD WILL BE DETERMINED. IN ADDITION, HEMATOLOGICAL CHANGES CORRELATING WITH THE CHIP ARCHITECTURE WILL BE DESCRIBED. IT IS SUSPECTED THAT VARYING BEHAVIORAL AND CLINICAL STATES WILL IMPACT THE RATE OF CHIP PROGRESSION IN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS. AIM 3 WILL DETERMINE THE INFLAMMATORY MARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH CHIP BURDEN IN THE STUDY POPULATION. HERE, LUMINEX-BASED HUMAN CYTOKINE/CHEMOKINE ASSAY WILL BE ADOPTED TO TEASE OUT INFLAMMATORY SIGNALS CORRELATING WITH CHIP BURDEN.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH BUILDS ON THE EXTENSIVE CAPACITIES AT THE HOST INSTITUTION CREATED THROUGH PREVIOUS NIH SUPPORTED PROJECTS. THE STUDY WILL RECRUIT 300 PREGNANT WOMEN FROM OUTPATIENT CLINICS OF SRI RAMACHANDRA HOSPITAL (APPLICANTS HOST INSTITUTE), CONDUCT 24-HOUR PERSONAL EXPOSURE MEASUREMENTS FOR PM2.5 AND PAHS THREE TIMES, ONCE DURING EACH TRIMESTER USING A WEARABLE SAMPLER AND ASSESS THE OXIDATIVE POTENTIAL OF THE PM2.5 FRACTIONS (PM-OP) BY ACELLULAR ASSAYS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH PM2.5 AND PAHS. URINARY LEVELS OF PAH METABOLITES (2- NAPHTHOL AND 1-HYDROXYPYRENE) AND 8-OXO-7,8-DIHYDRO-2\u2019-DEOXYGUANOSINE (8-OHDG), A BIOMARKER OF OXIDATIVE DAMAGE WILL BE MEASURED DURING EACH TRIMESTER AND LEUKOCYTE TELOMERE LENGTH (LTL) WILL BE MEASURED IN CORD BLOOD. THIS WILL ALLOW AN EVALUATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND INTERACTIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PM2.5, PAHS, PM-OP, URINARY BIOMARKERS (PAH METABOLITES AND 8-OHDG) AND TELOMERE LENGTH. ON A 100-PERSON SUBSET OF THE COHORT, FRESH AIR WRISTBANDS WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE A MEASURE OF PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO PAHS AND WILL BE EVALUATED WITH OTHER MEASURES OF EXPOSURE AND EFFECT. FINALLY, THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF PM2.5 AND PAHS ON TERM LOW-BIRTH WEIGHT WILL BE EXAMINED USING SINGLE, TWO AND MULTIPOLLUTANT MODELS. THE STUDY WILL STRENGTHEN THE LIMITED AVAILABLE EXPOSURE-RESPONSE EVIDENCE FOR PRENATAL PM2.5 AND PAH EXPOSURES AND BIRTHWEIGHT IN INDIA WHILE ALSO IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL VULNERABLE EXPOSURE WINDOWS. CAREER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WILL FOCUS ON ADVANCED TRAINING IN NOVEL EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES, MASS SPECTROMETRY-BASED TECHNIQUES FOR BIOMARKER ANALYSIS, REGRESSION ANALYSIS AND MULTIPOLLUTANT MODELING. THE INCREASED INVESTIGATOR CAPACITIES WILL ALLOW RESEARCH BEYOND TRADITIONAL PM MASS-RELATED HEALTH EFFECTS TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES THAT PREDOMINATE IN HIGH EXPOSURE SETTINGS OF URBAN INDIA.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "IND", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id":

PRELIMINARY RESEARCH FROM KWAZULU-NATAL (KZN), SA SHOWS THAT 23% OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED CRC PATIENTS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTHCARE SECTOR WILL FAIL TO ENGAGE IN ONCOLOGY CARE (FEOC). THIS COMPLICATES ONCOLOGISTS\u2019 AND ONCOLOGIC SURGEONS\u2019 EFFORTS TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CRC DISEASE IN THIS SETTING. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF RESOURCE-INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR ADDRESSING FEOC. HOWEVER, IMPLEMENTING THESE IN ALL NEWLY DIAGNOSED CRC PATIENTS WOULD BE UNFEASIBLE, GIVEN THE HIGH PATIENT VOLUMES AND EXISTING RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS IN THE SA PUBLIC HEALTHCARE SECTOR. A CLINICAL PREDICTION RULE (CPR) IS PROPOSED FOR IDENTIFYING NEWLY DIAGNOSED SA CRC PATIENTS WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF FEOC, THEREBY ENABLING MORE EFFICIENT TARGETING OF THESE SPECIFIC, HIGH RISK PATIENTS FOR INTERVENTIONS WHICH SEEK TO ADDRESS FEOC. THE CPR WILL BE DEVELOPED BY: 1) IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL PREDICTORS OF FEOC IN CRC POPULATIONS THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE AND A SURVEY OF 109 PATIENTS; 2) CONSTRUCTING AN APPROPRIATE ELECTRONIC DATA COLLECTION TOOL THAT WILL STREAMLINE PROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION FOR THESE POTENTIAL PREDICTORS AND THE STUDY OUTCOME, FEOC, FROM A COHORT OF 398 NEWLY DIAGNOSED CRC PATIENTS; AND 3) APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO THE DATA TO DERIVE AND INTERNALLY VALIDATE THE CPR. THE CPR WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN TACKLING THE HIGH FEOC RATES AMONGST NEWLY DIAGNOSED CRC PATIENTS IN KZN, SA AND WILL ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TOWARD IMPROVING BOTH CRC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PATIENT OUTCOMES IN THIS SETTING.

SHE HAS LIVED FULL-TIME IN LUSAKA, ZAMBIA SINCE AUGUST 2019 WHERE SHE HAS ESTABLISHED A SOLID CAREER FOUNDATION FOR CLINICAL RESEARCH IN OBSTETRIC OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN IN RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED SETTINGS. DR. SPELKE'S PROPOSED K01 RESEARCH WILL LEVERAGE A RECENT EXPANSION OF THE ZAMBIAN PRETERM BIRTH PREVENTION STUDY (ZAPPS), A LONG-STANDING PREGNANCY COHORT THAT IS FOLLOWING WOMEN AND THEIR INFANTS THROUGH 12 MONTHS POSTPARTUM. DR. SPELKE WILL STUDY A NOVEL STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY WOMEN AT RISK FOR SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN THE FIRST WEEK AFTER DELIVERY: CONTINUOUS REMOTE PHYSIOLOGIC MONITORING WITH EASY-TO-USE, MULTIPARAMETER, WEARABLE SENSORS. TO INFORM THE DESIGN OF A FUTURE HYBRID EFFECTIVENESS-IMPLEMENTATION TRIAL, DR. SPELKE PROPOSES A MENTORED RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT WILL ESTIMATE THE FREQUENCY OF SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY IN THE ZAPPS COHORT (AIM 1); IMPLEMENT A PILOT RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL OF POSTPARTUM PHYSIOLOGIC MONITORING (AIM 2); AND EVALUATE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO ADOPTION OF A DIGITAL HEALTH INTERVENTION IN A RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED SETTING THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH FRAMEWORKS (AIM 3).

THE IMPACT OF THE DISEASE REACHES BEYOND THOSE LIVING WITH THE CONDITION TO THEIR FAMILIES, SOCIETY, AND THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, WARRANTING STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO REDUCE ITS BURDEN. FOLLOWING A DIET CONSISTENT WITH MNT GUIDELINES IS WELL- DOCUMENTED TO HELP PEOPLE WITH T2D ACHIEVE BETTER GLYCEMIC CONTROL, REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR RISKS AND PREVENT COMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THESE BENEFITS, LOW ADHERENCE TO DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS IS CONSISTENTLY REPORTED. THE REASONS INCLUDE LACK OF NUTRITION KNOWLEDGE, DIFFICULTY TRANSLATING RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRACTICE, CULTURAL ACCEPTABILITY OF THE DIET, AND ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS. THUS, CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON LOCALLY AVAILABLE AND ACCEPTED FOODS THROUGH GUIDED COUNSELING ARE KEY TO IMPROVING DIETARY ADHERENCE RATES AMONG T2D PATIENTS IN THE COUNTRY.

CHILDREN IN LMICS ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE OF CANCER THAN CHILDREN IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS IMPACTING POOR OUTCOMES FOR VAST NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER IN LMICS IS THE LACK OF STRONG HEALTH SYSTEMS, WHICH IMPACTS TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE ALONG THE ENTIRE CARE CONTINUUM.

MY LONG-TERM CAREER GOAL IS TO ADDRESS THE BURDEN POSED BY THESE DISORDERS BY BECOMING A LEADING EXPERT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION AND DISSEMINATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS (EBTS) FOR THESE DISORDERS FOR USE IN LMICS. THIS GOAL IS MOTIVATED BY OBSERVATIONS FROM THE LITERATURE AND MY OWN WORK. DESPITE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EBTS, AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THOSE IN NEED (I.E., 85%) IN LMICS DO NOT RECEIVE TREATMENT AND, WHEN THEY DO, IT IS NOT EMPIRICALLY BASED. DESPITE THE CLEAR NEED FOR EBTS IN LMICS, THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY BARRIERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EBTS IN THESE AREAS. THESE BARRIERS INCLUDE: (1) EBTS TEND TO BE SINGLE DISORDER FOCUSED ONLY TREATING ONE DISORDER AT A TIME, (2) THEY ARE LONG IN DURATION (E.G., 12-16 TREATMENT SESSIONS TO TREAT ONE DISORDER), AND (3) THEY TEND TO BE COMPLEX AND REQUIRE A HIGH LEVEL OF SKILL TO ADMINISTER. GIVEN THE LOW AVAILABILITY OF HIGHLY TRAINED PROVIDERS IN LMICS, USING AN APPROACH THAT IS BRIEF, CULTURALLY CONGRUENT, AND LESS COMPLEX THAN TYPICAL EBTS IS IDEAL FOR REDUCING THESE BARRIERS.

MORE THAN 80% OF PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY LIVE IN LOW-TO MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, WHERE DESPITE THE HIGH INCIDENCES, MANY COMMONLY OCCURRING EPILEPSIES REMAIN UNDERSTUDIED AND POORLY CHARACTERIZED. NODDING SYNDROME AND RELATED EPILEPSIES ARE SUCH A CONSTELLATION OF EPILEPTIC BRAIN DISORDER THAT OCCURS IN SEVERAL SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. ALTHOUGH THE ETIOLOGY OF THIS DISEASE IS UNKNOWN, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE FOUND A CONSISTENT ASSOCIATION WITH THE PARASITE, ONCHOCERCA VOLVULUS (OV). AS THE OV PARASITE IS NOT NEUROINVASIVE, AUTOIMMUNITY TO HU-LEIOMODIN-1, A MUSCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, DUE TO MOLECULAR MIMICRY WITH OV ANTIGENS IS THOUGHT TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE PATHOGENESIS. STUDIES HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT VARIATIONS IN IMMUNE RESPONSES DUE TO HLA POLYMORPHISM MIGHT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ETIOLOGY. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF HOST GENETICS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO EXPOSURE TO OV IN THE MANIFESTATION OF EPILEPSY IS YET TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED.

TWO TYPES OF CASSAVA ARE TRADITIONALLY GROWN ACROSS THE GLOBE, THE \u201cSWEET\u201d AND \u201cBITTER\u201d VARIETIES, THE LATTER BEING AN ENVIRONMENTALLY TOLERANT PLANT, HARBORING EXTREMELY HIGH TO LETHAL DOSES OF TOXIC CYANOGENIC COMPOUNDS. CHRONIC DIETARY RELIANCE ON TOXIC CASSAVA IS ASSOCIATED WITH CYANIDE NEUROTOXICITY, CAUSING AN IRREVERSIBLE, NON-PROGRESSIVE MOTOR NEURON DISEASE KNOWN AS KONZO AND POSSIBLY, DEFICITS IN NEUROCOGNITION. WITHIN PRONE REGIONS OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, THERE ARE A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AFFECTED FOR REASONS AND MECHANISMS THAT HAVE YET TO BE FULLY ELUCIDATED. WHILE NEARLY MOST SUBJECTS IN KONZO-AFFECTED VILLAGES RELY HEAVILY ON CYANOGENIC CASSAVA AS A STAPLE FOOD, ONLY ABOUT 5 TO 10% PRESENT WITH A VISIBLE SPASTIC PARAPARESIS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT EXPOSURE LEVELS, NUTRITION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENTS SUCH AS THE DETOXIFICATION CAPABILITIES OF THE GUT MICROBIOME ARE LIKELY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE GUT FLORA PROFILES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN ADOLESCENTS WHO RELY ON CASSAVA WITH LOW-HIGH LEVELS OF TOXICITY IN THE DRC. EVEN WITHIN A REGION OF THE DRC THAT IS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO OUTBREAKS OF DISEASE, THERE ARE MARKED DIFFERENCES IN BACTERIAL COMPOSITION BETWEEN UNAFFECTED INDIVIDUALS DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY RESIDE IN VILLAGES WITH HISTORICALLY HIGH OR LOW KONZO PREVALENCE, AGAIN ADDING TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF DISEASE MODULATION THROUGH THE GUT MICROBIOME. BASED ON INSIGHT FROM OUR PRELIMINARY AND PUBLISHED DATA, WE WILL INVESTIGATE IF THERE ARE FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE GUT-FLORA BETWEEN SEX-MATCHED SIBLING PAIRS WHO ARE DISCORDANT FOR DISEASE, BY UTILIZING METAGENOMIC AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC SEQUENCING APPROACHES ON STOOL SPECIMENS (AIM 1). USING THE SAME STUDY POPULATION, WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE IF METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ARE IDENTIFIABLE THAT INDICATE A DISEASE STATE OR SUSCEPTIBILITY USING STATE-OF-THE-ART METABOLIC APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ULTRA-HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED WITH MASS SPECTROMETRY (UHPLC-MS/MS) (AIM 2). THE DATA GENERATED FROM BOTH APPROACHES WILL ENABLE US TO NOT ONLY ASSESS THE PROFILES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE GUT MICROBIOME IN RELATION TO DISEASE STATUS, BUT WILL PROVIDE THE POWER TO DETERMINE THE HOST-MICROBIOME INTERACTION IN REGARDS TO DOWNSTREAM METABOLIC PROCESSES.

GENOMICS AND HIV CURE - PROJECT SUMMARY  BOTSWANA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE COUNTRIES MOST AFFECTED BY HIV-1 AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE TOP 3 COUNTRIES BY HIV-1 PREVALENCE FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. THE COUNTRY HAS RESPONDED GALLANTLY BY PROVIDING FREE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) TO PERSONS LIVING WITH HIV-1 (PLWH) IN 2002 AND AN AGGRESSIVE COMBINATION OF PREVENTION STRATEGIES. THIS HAS RESULTED IN REDUCED HIV-1 INCIDENCE AND ASSOCIATED MORTALITY AND THE COUNTRY WAS THE THIRD GLOBALLY TO REACH THE UNAIDS 95-95-95 TARGETS OF HIV-1 DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND VIRAL SUPPRESSION. SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1996, THE BOTSWANA HARVARD AIDS INSTITUTE PARTNERSHIP (BHP) HAS CONDUCTED INVESTIGATOR-INITIATED CLINICAL TRIALS, OBSERVATIONAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES, LABORATORY-BASED STUDIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE RESEARCH. BHP LABORATORY ALSO CARRIES OUT MOLECULAR VIROLOGY RESEARCH ON HIV AND THIS RESEARCH HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZING HIV-1 SUBTYPE C, WHICH PREDOMINATES IN BOTSWANA AND SOUTHERN AFRICA. WE DRAW UPON THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF THE EXPERIENCE GAINED OVER MORE THAN 2 DECADES OF INVESTIGATOR-INITIATED RESEARCH, TRAINING, AND CAPACITY BUILDING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HIV-1 GENOMICS TRAINING. SINCE 2017, WE HAVE INVESTED IN IMPLEMENTING PATHOGEN AGNOSTIC NEXT- GENERATION SEQUENCING WHICH WAS CRITICAL IN THE FIRST SEQUENCING OF THE SARS-COV-2 OMICRON VARIANT OF CONCERN IN BOTSWANA. WORKING WITH OUR COLLABORATORS WE HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED COHORTS OF VERY EARLY TREATED INFANTS AND ADOLESCENTS FOR UNDERSTANDING HIV-1 RESERVOIRS.  WE, THEREFORE, AIM THROUGH THIS APPLICATION TO STRENGTHEN BHP IN HIV-1 GENOMICS AND MOLECULAR VIROLOGY CAPACITY IN BOTSWANA AND INCREASE ACCESS TO PATHOGEN GENOMICS IN THE SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA REGION AS A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE. THE CAPACITY DEVELOPED HERE WILL BE CROSSCUTTING FOR VIROLOGIC STUDIES AND WILL THUS BE INSTRUMENTAL IN BHP LAB\u2019S CONTINUED DIVERSIFICATION INTO RESEARCH ON OTHER EMERGING PATHOGENS OF GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH INTEREST. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE AIM TO 1) DEVELOP AND ADVANCE BHP AS AN HIV-1 GENOMICS REGIONAL CENTER OF EXCELLENCE. WE WILL LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE IN PATHOGEN GENOMICS DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS TO FACILITATE CAPACITY BUILDING BY HOSTING COURSES IN HIV-1 SEQUENCING, BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS, AND SEQUENCE DATA INTERPRETATION. BUILDING ON OUR COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF BOTSWANA, HARVARD T.H. CHAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH (HSPH), AND THE RAGON INSTITUTE OF MGH, MIT & HARVARD, WE WILL TARGET STUDENTS AND FACULTY FROM LOCAL AND REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE TRAINING. WE WILL FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIV GENOMICS, MAKE THEM ACCESSIBLE TO LOCAL UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, AND 2) TO ESTABLISH HIV-1 RESERVOIR ASSAYS IN SUPPORT OF THE ONGOING AND PLANNED HIV-1 CURE STUDIES AT BHP. WE PLAN TO SET UP ASSAYS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF HIV-1 RESERVOIRS IN PLWH IN BOTSWANA. LABORATORY SCIENTISTS WILL BE TRAINED ON A NUMBER OF THESE ASSAYS AT THE COLLABORATOR\u2019S LABORATORY IN BOSTON (RAGON INSTITUTE OF MGH, MIT & HARVARD). WE WILL ALSO TRAIN AND ESTABLISH CAPACITY FOR THE BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS FOR HIV-1 RESERVOIR CHARACTERIZATION. 1", "Place of Performance Country Code": "BWA", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ba6cbc07-ffa8-867f-5e45-a28317f70580-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_G11TW012503_7529"}, {"internal_id": 148296222, "Award ID": "G11TW012270", "Award Amount": 200769.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-21", "CFDA Number": "93.989", "Description": "STRENGTHENING RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT FOR CRITICAL HIV RESEARCH IN KENYA (STRAM-CHR) - ABSTRACT KENYA REMAINS ONE OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WITH HIGH HIV DISEASE BURDEN WITH APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION KENYANS LIVING WITH HIV, AND 46,000 NEW INFECTIONS ANNUALLY. THOUGH APPRECIABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TOWARDS EPIDEMIC CONTROL, IMPACT IS PATCHY: THE INCIDENCE OF NEW HIV INFECTIONS, HIV-RELATED MORTALITY, AND SEVERE ILLNESS REMAIN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH. MORE THAN 75% OF FINANCING FOR HIV PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACTIVITIES IS THROUGH EXTERNAL DONOR FUNDS. FROM THE EARLIEST ONSET OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC, THE UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC THROUGH BASIC, TRANSLATIONAL, CLINICAL, AND IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE RESEARCH PROJECTS HAVE BEEN LED BY INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATORS WITH FEWER LOCAL FACULTY AND SCIENTISTS ORIGINATING HIGH IMPACT HIV-RELATED RESEARCH. A MAJOR BARRIER HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENT HUMAN RESOURCES WITH REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO SUPPORT IN THE APPLICATION, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECTS AND THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PAUCITY OF LOCALLY INITIATED HIGH IMPACT HIV RESEARCH. OVER THE YEARS, THE UON HAS MADE EFFORTS TO ENHANCE RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT LEADING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTER FOR RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND GRANTS ADVANCEMENT (CERIGA). THIS CENTER IS AN OUTCOME OF INVESTMENTS BY THE US NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL EXTRAMURAL ASSOCIATES DEVELOPMENT AWARD (IEARDA) AND THE MEDICAL EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE (MEPI) IS MANDATED TO SUPPORT RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI THROUGHOUT THE GRANT MANAGEMENT CYCLE BY IDENTIFYING FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES, SUPPORTING RESEARCHERS THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS, MANAGEMENT DURING IMPLEMENTATION AND CLOSEOUT IN COMPLIANCE WITH DONOR REQUIREMENTS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (UW), WE PROPOSE TO IMPLEMENT A PROJECT ENTITLED \u201cSTRENGTHENING RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT FOR CRITICAL HIV RESEARCH IN KENYA (STRAM-CHR)\u201d AIMED AT ENHANCING LOCAL CAPACITY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REQUIRED FOR THE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI (UON) AND LOCAL PARTNER INSTITUTIONS. THROUGH THIS PROJECT, FIRST, WE AIM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AND UPDATED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION PERSONNEL WORKING AT CERIGA, OTHER FUNDED PROJECTS WITHIN THE UON, THE UON FINANCE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS COLLABORATIVELY IMPLEMENTING RESEARCH PROJECTS TO BUILD THEIR CAPACITY TO SUPPORT INVESTIGATORS AND RESEARCHERS WHO ARE CONDUCTING CRITICAL HIV RESEARCH. SECONDLY, WE PLAN TO DEVELOP KEY POLICIES AND GUIDELINES FOR RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT AT THE UON AND DEVELOP NEW ONES WHERE THEY DO NOT EXIST. THIRDLY, WE AIM TO REVIEW, UPDATE AND CONVERT EXISTING RELEVANT TRAINING PROGRAMS TO E-FORMAT WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON: RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT; RESEARCH INTEGRITY OVERSIGHT; ETHICAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH; INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS (ICT) FOR RESEARCH AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION. THESE COURSES WILL BE ACCESSED BY THE LARGER TEAM OF RESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS WITHIN UON AND ALL ITS PARTNERS. BY THE END OF THE THREE YEARS OF THIS PROJECT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE UON WILL HAVE INCREASED CAPACITY TO SUPPORT APPLICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF DONOR FUNDED PROJECTS AND CERIGA WILL EMERGE AS A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORTING SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS IN KENYA AND BEYOND.

FUNDED TRAINING INITIATIVES OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT BUILDING BIOSTATISTICS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND EAST AFRICA, BUT NO SUCH PROGRAMS CURRENTLY EXIST IN WEST AFRICA.  THE VANDERBILT-NIGERIA BIOSTATISTICS TRAINING PROGRAM (VN-BIOSTAT) BUILDS ON LONG-STANDING COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN TWO LEADING RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS IN NIGERIA AND THE UNITED STATES, NAMELY, AMINU KANO TEACHING HOSPITAL (AKTH) AND VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER (VANDERBILT) TO ESTABLISH A RESEARCH AND TRAINING PLATFORM FOR BIOSTATISTICIANS DOING HIV-RELATED RESEARCH IN NIGERIA. VN-BIOSTAT WILL BUILD UPON THE RESOURCES OF AKTH AND ITS PARENT INSTITUTION, BAYERO UNIVERSITY IN KANO (BUK), TO CREATE A COHORT OF HIGHLY SKILLED NIGERIAN BIOSTATISTICIANS WITH THE CAPACITY TO LEAD AND SUPERVISE BIOSTATISTICAL ACTIVITIES IN WEST AFRICA. VN-BIOSTAT LEVERAGES THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, COLLABORATIVE AND RAPIDLY EXPANDING PORTFOLIO OF U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) AND OTHER FUNDED RESEARCH AT AKTH, WITH JOINT LEADERSHIP FROM VANDERBILT INVESTIGATORS. TO TRAIN BIOSTATISTICIAN LEADERS IN NIGERIA, THE VN-BIOSTAT PROGRAM PROPOSES TO BRING TWO NIGERIAN DATA SCIENTISTS PER YEAR (TOTAL OF 10 OVER 5 YEARS) TO VANDERBILT TO IMMERSE THEM IN BIOSTATISTICS AND TO RECEIVE HANDS ON TRAINING. DURING THE ONE-YEAR TRAINING PERIOD, TRAINEES WILL LEAD THE DESIGN, ANALYSIS, AND PUBLICATION OF A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROJECT USING HIV DATA FROM AKTH. THEY WILL ALSO LEAD A RELATED, METHODOLOGICALLY FOCUSED PROJECT THAT WILL CULMINATE IN A PUBLICATION. WHILE AT VANDERBILT, THEY WILL INTERACT WITH A TEAM OF HIV BIOSTATISTICIANS, TAKE APPROPRIATE BIOSTATISTICS COURSES (UP TO 8 CREDIT HOURS PER SEMESTER FOR 2 SEMESTERS), ATTEND BIOSTATISTICS AND GLOBAL HEALTH SEMINARS, PARTICIPATE IN A GRANT-WRITING WORKSHOP, ATTEND BIOSTATISTICS CLINICS, AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER NIGERIAN INVESTIGATORS. THEY WILL RECEIVE MENTORSHIP FROM VANDERBILT FACULTY (ONE BIOSTATISTICIAN AND ONE CLINICAL INVESTIGATOR) AND AKTH FACULTY.

MOST OF THEM RESIDE IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS). SOUTHEAST ASIA HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST BURDENS OF BOTH TRAUMA AND INJURIES, AND RELATED DISABILITIES (MURRAY 2013). IN VIETNAM, WHILE MORTALITY DUE TO INJURIES HAS DECLINED SINCE 2008, THE INCIDENCE OF INJURIES HAS BEEN INCREASING, WHICH HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN YEARS LIVED WITH DISABILITIES (YLDS) FOR MOST INJURIES (NGUYEN 2020). ADDRESSING THIS GROWING BURDEN OF POST- INJURY DISABILITIES AND THE NEED FOR REHABILITATION IS A KEY PRIORITY AREA FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM. HOWEVER, IN VIETNAM AND ACROSS SOUTHEAST ASIA, THERE IS LIMITED LOCAL CAPACITY FOR CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF INJURIES AND POST-INJURY REHABILITATION, WHICH WOULD INFORM NATIONAL POLICY AND PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSES. THE ABSENCE OF COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THE SCIENCE OF DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION, AND THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT WITHIN THE LARGER PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR IN VIETNAM, CREATE A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO ANALYTIC WORK IN THIS FIELD.

FURTHERMORE, MANY NEW TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS DEVELOPED IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE NOT BEEN WELL UTILIZED BY AFRICA SCIENTISTS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW TOOLS IN MOLECULAR POPULATION GENETICS, GENOMICS AND BIOINFORMATICS AND DISEASE MODELING HAVE NOT BEEN INTEGRATED INTO MALARIA RESEARCH AND CONTROL IN AFRICA. LOW RESEARCH CAPACITY IN WEST AFRICA IS FAR MORE DIRE IN COMPARISON TO OTHER AFRICAN REGIONS. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE RESEARCH CAPACITY IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN WEST AFRICA. WE PROPOSE THIS REGIONAL CENTRE FOR VECTOR BORNE DISEASES IN WEST AFRICA (RCVBD) TO ENHANCE RESEARCH CAPACITY IN MALARIA EPIDEMIOLOGY AND MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY THROUGH TRAINING PHD STUDENTS AND JUNIOR FACULTY AND RESEARCH SCIENTISTS. THE CONSORTIUM PARTNERS ARE FROM THREE WEST AFRICAN INSTITUTIONS (UNIVERSITY OF GHANA, THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL UNIT GAMBIA, AND INSTITUT DE RECHERCHE EN SCIENCES DE LA SANTE OF BURKINA FASO). COLLABORATORS FROM THREE US INSTITUTIONS (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT IRVINE, UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO AND THE NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY) WILL ASSIST THE TRAINING PROGRAM. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS TRAINING PROGRAM IS TO ENHANCE RESEARCH CAPACITY IN WEST AFRICA BY TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF AFRICAN SCIENTISTS IN THE AREA OF VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE RESEARCH AND CONTROL WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON MALARIA. THE THEMATIC AREAS OF TRAINING INCLUDE EPIDEMIOLOGY, MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY AND APPLICATION OF NEW GENETIC, GENOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH TOOLS. WE PROPOSE THREE TRACKS OF TRAINING. TRACK 1 WILL BE LONG-TERM TRAINING OF 8 PHD STUDENTS IN WEST AFRICA. TRACK 2 WILL PROVIDE SHORT- TERM RESEARCH TRAINING TO 15 JUNIOR UNIVERSITY FACULTY AND JUNIOR SCIENTISTS FROM THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH IN WEST AFRICA TO FOSTER SPECIFIC SKILLS REQUIRED FOR MALARIA RESEARCH AND CONTROL. TRACK 3 WILL BE TRAINING WORKSHOPS AND SHORT COURSES TO DISSEMINATE TECHNIQUES AND KNOWLEDGE TO WIDE COMMUNITIES INVOLVED IN VECTOR BORNE DISEASE RESEARCH AND CONTROL IN WEST AFRICA. THIS TRAINING PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON FOUR SCIENTIFIC AREAS IN URGENT NEED, INCLUDING 1) NEW TOOLS FOR MALARIA EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND ENTOMOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE, 2) ANTIMALARIAL DRUG RESISTANCE TO ARTEMISININ AND PARTNER DRUGS, 3) POPULATION GENOMICS OF INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE, AND 4) MODELING MALARIA TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS AND MALARIA INTERVENTION STRATEGIES.

MOTIVATED BY RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE REDUCTION OF MALARIA-RELATED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, SIX GMS COUNTRIES HAVE ENDORSED A REGIONAL MALARIA ELIMINATION PLAN WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL TO WHOLLY ELIMINATE MALARIA BY 2030. HOWEVER, THIS AMBITIOUS PLAN ENCOUNTERS A BATTERY OF CHALLENGES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED URGENTLY. IN THE GMS, MALARIA SHOWS TREMENDOUS HETEROGENEITY IN DISEASE DISTRIBUTION, WITH MYANMAR ACCOUNTING FOR NEARLY HALF OF THE REGION CONFIRMED MALARIA CASES. THE RECENT EMERGENCE OF ARTEMISININ RESISTANCE IN PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM AND DETERIORATING EFFICACY OF THE FRONTLINE TREATMENT FOR PLASMODIUM VIVAX ARE MAJOR CONCERNS FOR MALARIA ELIMINATION. FURTHERMORE, THE EMERGENCE OF INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE IN MAJOR MALARIA VECTORS COMPROMISES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CORE VECTOR CONTROL MEASURES SUCH AS INSECTICIDE-TREATED BED NETS AND INDOOR RESIDUAL SPRAYING. DESPITE THE NEED FOR STRENGTHENED RESEARCH TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, THERE IS A CRITICAL SHORTAGE IN A WELL-TRAINED WORKFORCE IN MALARIA RESEARCH IN MYANMAR. THEREFORE, THIS TRAINING PROGRAM WILL ADDRESS KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN MALARIA RESEARCH, FOCUSING ON THREE SCIENTIFIC AREAS. SPECIFICALLY, WE AIM TO UNDERSTAND THE CHANGING MALARIA EPIDEMIOLOGY IN THIS REGION, TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE CLINICAL EFFICACIES OF ANTIMALARIAL DRUGS AND ELUCIDATE THE UNDERLYING RESISTANCE MECHANISMS, AND TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT, DISTRIBUTION, AND MECHANISMS OF PYRETHROID RESISTANCE IN MAJOR MALARIA VECTOR MOSQUITOES. WITHIN THIS TRAINING PROGRAM, MENTORS OF DIVERSE SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE MAGWAY WILL JOIN FORCES TO OFFER MULTIDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN INNOVATIVE APPROACHES THAT ADDRESS CRITICAL PROBLEMS IN THE CURRENT MALARIA ELIMINATION CAMPAIGN IN THIS REGION. BASED ON TRAINING NEEDS ASSESSMENT, WE PROPOSE TO USE A DOUBLE-TRACK TRAINING MECHANISM: 1) LONG-TERM TRAINING OF THREE JUNIOR FACULTY MEMBERS, THREE POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS AND SIX PHD STUDENTS, AND 2) SHORT-TERM TRAINING OF ENDEMIC COUNTRY SCIENTISTS THROUGH ANNUAL SHORT COURSES AND WORKSHOPS. THE OVERALL TRAINING PARADIGM DESIGNED IN THIS APPLICATION WILL ENSURE THAT ALL TRAINEES OBTAIN THE REQUIRED SET OF TECHNICAL SKILLS AND INTELLECTUAL EXPERTISE TO CONDUCT INDEPENDENT RESEARCH ON MALARIA. IN ADDITION, THIS TRAINING PROGRAM WILL SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR THE TRANSFER OF ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES TO ENDEMIC-AREA SCIENTISTS. BY ADVANCING THE CAREERS OF THESE TRAINEES, THIS PROGRAM AIMS TO BUILD A CRITICAL MASS OF INVESTIGATORS AND A NECESSARY INTELLECTUAL NETWORK IN MYANMAR TO FOCUS ON MALARIA RESEARCH.", "Place of

SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES MONA CAMPUS AIMS TO EXPAND ITS INTER- DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH CAPACITY BY DEVELOPING A TRAINING PROGRAM TO STUDY THE DETERMINANTS OF PERIODONTITIS AND ASSOCIATED NON-COMMUNICABLE CHRONIC DISEASES IN JAMAICA. THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR RESEARCH IN PERIODONTITIS, A HIGHLY PREVALENT NON-COMMUNICABLE CHRONIC CONDITION WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR ORAL AND SYSTEMIC HEALTH, FOR WHICH THERE IS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE WITH RESPECT TO ITS EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY IN THE CARIBBEAN REGION. THIS PROGRAM WILL BE FOCUSED ON EXPANDING THE CLINICAL, EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BASIC SCIENCE RESEARCH CAPACITY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF BASIC MEDICAL SCIENCES AND THE MONA SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CARIBBEAN INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH RESEARCH (CAIHR). THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS RESEARCH CAPACITY REQUIRES THE TRAINING OF CLINICAL AND BASIC SCIENTISTS TO BE MENTORED BY FACULTY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY AT BUFFALO AND RUSH UNIVERSITY IN THE US. TRAINEES WILL BE DEGREE CANDIDATES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES ENROLLED IN MASTERS OR PHD PROGRAMS AND DENTAL CLINICIANS CONDUCTING POST- DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP TRAINING, WHO WILL BE PART OF INTER-DISCIPLINARY TEAMS THAT WILL INVESTIGATE THE SOCIAL, BEHAVIORAL, MICROBIOME AND HOST RESPONSE DETERMINANTS OF PERIODONTITIS IN JAMAICAN SUBJECT COHORTS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS APPLICATION ARE TO 1) CREATE A CORE OF YOUNG INVESTIGATORS (4 PRE-DOCTORAL BASIC SCIENTISTS OR EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND 4 POST-DOCTORAL DENTIST-SCIENTISTS) TO CONDUCT INTER-DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES IN JAMAICA. 2) PROVIDE A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM-BASED MENTORING APPROACH TO CONDUCT INNOVATIVE RESEARCH THAT INTEGRATES EPIDEMIOLOGY, MICROBIOME SCIENCE, IMMUNOLOGY, TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE AND DATA SCIENCE. 3) BUILD THE FOUNDATION TO ESTABLISH LARGE HUMAN SUBJECT COHORTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES TO STUDY PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES, THEREBY SUPPORTING FUTURE INDEPENDENT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF YOUNG FACULTY WHO WILL TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF GRADUATE STUDENTS AND FELLOWS. THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH INTER-DISCIPLINARY TEAMS OF MENTORS AND TRAINEES FOCUSED ON EVALUATING THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF PERIODONTITIS IN A COHORT OF CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS AND IN AN ADULT COHORT AFFECTED BY CARDIOMETABOLIC SYSTEMIC DISEASE. CUSTOMIZED CURRICULA BASED ON EACH TRAINEE\u2019S INDIVIDUALIZED DEVELOPMENT PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. TRAINEES WILL HAVE A SHORT-TERM (6 MONTHS) TRAINING EXPERIENCE IN US LABORATORIES DIRECTED BY FACULTY MENTORS WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN EPIDEMIOLOGY, PERIODONTOLOGY, MICROBIOME, BIOINFORMATICS, IMMUNOLOGY AND CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASE, WHILE COMPLETING THEIR RESEARCH DEGREE OR POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES. THIS PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A RIGOROUS INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENTIFIC TRAINING EXPERIENCE AND CREATE A POOL OF CANDIDATES WITH POTENTIAL TO JOIN THE FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES.

THESE DISEASES SHARE COMMON RISK FACTORS WITH OTHER MAJOR CHRONIC NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND DISORDERS (NCDS). THE WELL-ESTABLISHED ORAL-SYSTEMIC HEALTH CONNECTIONS ALSO INDICATE THAT PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ORAL DISEASES IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN MAINTAINING GOOD GENERAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. YET, DUE TO THE LACK OF PERSONNEL, ACCESS TO TRAINING, KNOWLEDGE OF RESEARCH METHODS, AND FUNDING, ORAL HEALTH CARE AND RESEARCH IS STILL LIMITED IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. THE LARGE DIVERSITIES IN THE GEOGRAPHY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND CULTURES IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR LOCALLY RELEVANT RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY RISK FACTORS AND ORAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN EACH COUNTRY. THE GOAL OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO SUSTAINABLY STRENGTHEN THE ORAL HEALTH RESEARCH CAPACITY AMONG LMICS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA BY ESTABLISHING A TRAINING HUB IN THAILAND AND FOSTERING A NETWORK OF REGIONAL RESEARCHERS.
