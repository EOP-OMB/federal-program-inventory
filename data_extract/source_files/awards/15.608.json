HABITAT RESTORATION IN THE SOUTHERN GREEN BAY HAS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED MUSKELLUNGE IN LOCATIONS SUCH AS THE CAT ISLAND CHAIN AND THE DUCK CREEK ESTUARY. STOCKING EFFORTS HAVE ESTABLISHED A WORLD-RENOWNED FISHERY FOR MUSKELLUNGE WITHIN GREEN BAY, BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE EVIDENCE OF SUCCESSFUL NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND THE POPULATION REMAINS RELIANT ON STOCKING TO SUSTAIN THE FISHERY. SPAWNING IN SOUTHERN GREEN BAY THAT OCCURS OUTSIDE OF TRIBUTARIES COULD REPRESENT A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF SUCCESSFUL NATURAL REPRODUCTION THAT HAS NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY ASSESSED.

WE HAVEDEVELOPED FOUR PROJECTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SPREAD, POPULATION DYNAMICS, AND EFFECTS OF INVASIVE CARP IN THESE SYSTEMS. FIRST, HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN SILVER CARP AND BIGHEAD CARP IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM DISTINCTIVE HYBRID GILL MORPHOLOGY, BUT THE GENETIC AND ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING HYBRIDIZATION REMAIN ELUSIVE. FURTHER, THE EXTENT OF BIGHEADED CARP HYBRIDIZATION COULD BE CHANGING THROUGH TIME BUT HAS NOT BEEN ASSESSED. THIS WORK IS IMPORTANT AS HYBRIDIZATION MAY DAMPEN POPULATION GROWTH IF HYBRIDS CONTRIBUTE FEWER OFFSPRING TO THE NEXT GENERATION RELATIVE TO THE PARENTAL SPECIES. THEREFORE, WE WILL ASSESS THE EXTENT INTROGRESSIVE HYBRIDIZATION VARIES TEMPORALLY IN PORTIONS OF THE UMR, EXAMINE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF HYBRIDIZATION, AND POTENTIAL EFFECTS TO FITNESS LINKED CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS BODY CONDITION.NEXT, INVASIVE CARP ARE EXPANDING UPSTREAM IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN. HOWEVER, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FULL IMPACTS OF BIGHEADED CARP INVASIONS TO RIVER ECOSYSTEMS AT DIFFERENT DENSITIES IS INCOMPLETE WHICH HAMPERS OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR POPULATIONS THROUGH EARLY DETECTION, BARRIER MANAGEMENT, AND REMOVAL. PREVIOUS RESEARCH FOCUSED ON TROPHIC COMPETITION BETWEEN BIGHEADED CARP AND NATIVE PLANKTIVORES AND FOUND HIGH DIET OVERLAP. HOWEVER, POTENTIAL FOOD WEB CONSEQUENCES OF INVASIVE CARP ON OTHER FISHES ARE UNKNOWN. GRADIENTS OF BIGHEADED CARP ABUNDANCE RANGE FROM ABSENT UPSTREAM OF TRIBUTARY DAMS TO DOMINANT IN DOWNSTREAM REACHES OF SOUTHERN TRIBUTARIES. THIS ESTABLISHES A SPATIALLY REPLICATED GRADIENT OF CARP ABUNDANCE ACROSS THE REGION AND PRESENTS A TIMELY OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW INVASIVE SPECIES ABUNDANCE MAY INFLUENCE FOOD WEBS DYNAMICS. THIRD, THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER INVASIVE CARP PARTNERSHIP HAS IDENTIFIED THE AREA FROM LD 15 DOWNSTREAM TO LD 19 AS THE INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT ZONE (IMZ) FOR BIGHEAD CARP AND SILVER CARP. CONTRACTED REMOVAL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THIS ZONE SINCE 2016, BUT THE IMPACTS OF THOSE EFFORTS ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. FURTHERMORE, ADDITIONAL CONTRACT REMOVALS IN POOLS 20-22 BEGAN IN FY21, AND VARIOUS LEVELS OF INDEPENDENT COMMERCIAL FISHING FOR INVASIVE CARP ALSO OCCUR, PRIMARILY BELOW LD 19. A ROBUST STOCK ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IS NEEDED TO MORE DIRECTLY EVALUATE HOW POPULATIONS OF INVASIVE CARPS MAY BE AFFECTED BY CURRENT CONTRACT REMOVALS AND CONTROL EFFORTS, AND TO FORECAST THEIR FUTURE RESPONSE TO ALTERNATIVE CONTROL STRATEGIES. FINALLY, INVASIVE CARP ARE WELL-ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT THE MISSOURI RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES DOWNSTREAM OF GAVINS POINT DAM. KNOWING WHEN AND UNDER WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ADULT BIGHEAD AND SILVER CARP ARE MOVING INTO THE TRIBUTARIES WILL HELP INFORM WHEN TO MONITOR THE POPULATION AS WELL AS IMPLEMENT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE MOVEMENT RANGE OF BIGHEAD AND SILVER CARP IN THE MISSOURI RIVER BASIN, THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MOVEMENTS, AND THE CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CONGREGATIONS AT DETERRENT BARRIERS CURRENTLY PRESENT IN THE MISSOURI RIVER BASIN WILL ALLOW FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF LOCATIONS WHERE DETERRENCE TECHNOLOGIES, CONCENTRATED REMOVAL EFFORTS, PHYSICAL BARRIERS, OR OTHER EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE UTILIZED FOR CONTAINMENT AND CONTROL.

OTHER WETLANDS ARE OWNED AND MANAGED BY THE STATE OF OREGON  KLAMATH WILDLIFE AREA, MILLER ISLAND UNIT . THE REMAINING WETLANDS ARE OWNED AND MANAGED PRIVATELY. THE FRINGE WETLAND MASTER PLAN FOR THE KENO REACH OF THE KLAMATH RIVER WOULD IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE CREATION, RESTORATION, AND ENHANCEMENT OF LITTORAL WETLANDS AND OTHER FLOODPLAIN WETLANDS ALONG AND WITHIN THE KENO REACH. RESTORATION OF WETLANDS WITHIN THIS REACH IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY BY REMOVING NUTRIENTS, SUSPENDED SOLIDS, AND OTHER POLLUTANTS FROM WATER IN THE KLAMATH RIVER, AND WATER FLOWS DOWNSTREAM THROUGH THE REACH. FURTHER, WETLAND CREATION, RESTORATION, AND ENHANCEMENT WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HABITAT FOR MIGRATORY WATERFOWL AND OTHER NATIVE WILDLIFE SUCH AS FISH  INCLUDING ESA ENDANGERED SHORTNOSE AND LOST RIVER SUCKERS AND CRITICAL HABITAT , SONGBIRDS, MIGRATORY SHOREBIRDS, AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES, INVERTEBRATES, AND MAMMALS. FOLLOWING DAM REMOVAL ON THE KLAMATH RIVER, SALMON AND STEELHEAD ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN TO THE UPPER KLAMATH BASIN. CREATION, EXPANSION, AND IMPROVEMENT OF WETLANDS WITHIN THE REACH, AS WELL AS THE RESULTING WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS, WOULD BENEFIT ANADROMOUS FISH ENTERING THE REACH. THE PLAN WILL ALSO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF DIFFUSE SOURCE TREATMENT WETLANDS TO LOCALLY TREAT AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF FROM ADJACENT AGRICULTURAL DRAINS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT WILL FIRST ANALYSIS EXISTING TOPOGRAPHIC AND BATHYMETRIC DATA IN THE PROJECT REACH TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE FRINGE WETLAND CREATION, RESTORATION, AND OR ENHANCEMENT ARE POSSIBLE. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL THEN INITIATE AN OUTREACH EFFORT TO LANDOWNERS ALONG THE PROJECT REACH TO GAUGE INTEREST IN FUTURE PARTICIPATION IN WETLAND RESTORATION ENHANCEMENT PROJECTS. DATA FROM THESE FIRST TASKS WILL BE CAPTURED AND STORED IN A DATABASE THAT SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE WETLAND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT. THE PROJECT TEAM ALSO INTENDS TO PARTNER WITH THE TULE SMOKE HUNT CLUB TO EVALUATE WETLAND ENHANCEMENT AND RESTORATION OPPORTUNITIES ON CLUB PROPERTY. THIS WILL INCLUDE HIGH-RESOLUTION TOPO-BATHYMETRIC DATA COLLECTION FOLLOWING A CONTROLLED BURN IN THE SPRING OF 2023, EVALUATION AND MODELING OF SITE HYDROLOGY, AND IDENTIFICATION OF ALTERNATIVES FOR IMPROVING WATER CIRCULATION THROUGH THE EXISTING WETLANDS.

THE BASIC APPROACH IS SIMPLE. FOR ERADICATION EFFORTS, YOU REMOVE 25-50  OF THE INVASIVE FISH SPECIES ANNUALLY AND THEN STOCK AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF YY MALES TO REPLACE FISH THAT ARE REMOVED. THE YY MALES BREED WITH WILD FEMALES AND PRODUCE ONLY MALE OFFSPRING. OVER TIME, THE INVASIVE POPULATION BECOME ALL MALES. WHEN THIS OCCURS, YOU CONTINUE STOCKING YY MALES UNTIL THE INVASIVE POPULATION DIES OUT IN A MATTER OF YEARS, DEPENDING ON HOW LONG LIVED THE SPECIES IS. BECAUSE THE YY MALES ARE NOT GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS (GMO), IF THE DECISION IS MADE TO STOP THE PROGRAM, THE SEX RATIO WILL RETURN TO 50:50 MALE TO FEMALE AND CONTINUE ON  COMPLETELY REVERSIBLE. IN THE CASE OF NEW INTRODUCTIONS, IF THEY ARE DETECTED EARLY AND THERE IS A YY MALE BROODSTOCK AVAILABLE FOR THE INVASIVE FISH, YOU SIMPLY STOCK THE YY MALES WITH THE INVASIVE POPULATION AND CONVERT THEM TO ALL MALES QUICKLY, NEVER ALLOWING THE INTRODUCTION TO GET GOING.

CAPTIVE REARED INDIVIDUALS ARE TYPICALLY RELEASED TO AUGMENT EXISTING POPULATIONS, REINTRODUCED TO THEIR HISTORICALLY OCCUPIED HABITATS, OR INTRODUCED TO LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF THEIR HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES. FRESHWATER MUSSELS ARE AMONG THE MOST ENDANGERED ORGANISMS IN THE WORLD DUE TO HISTORIC AND ONGOING THREATS TO THEIR POPULATIONS INCLUDING HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION, WATER POLLUTION, AND CLIMATE CHANGE. A GOAL OF CONSERVATION PROGRAMS IS TO PRESERVE NATURALLY OCCURRING GENETIC VARIABILITY WITHIN SPECIES, SO THAT THE SPECIES WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADAPT TO ONGOING AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. HOWEVER, GENETIC ASSESSMENTS ARE LARGELY MISSING IN MUSSEL PROPAGATION AND RELEASE PROGRAMS. AS A BROADCAST SPAWNER, FEMALE MUSSELS CAN FERTILIZE THEIR EGGS WITH AVAILABLE SPERM IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AS A RESULT, MULTIPLE PATERNITY WITHIN A SINGLE BROOD IS EXPECTED TO BE COMMON. HOWEVER, TO DATE, A LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED MULTIPLE PATERNITY IN FRESHWATER MUSSELS, AND THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MULTIPLE PATERNITY AND GENETIC VARIABILITY WITHIN BROODS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. FURTHERMORE, CURRENT CAPTIVE PROPAGATION PROGRAMS FOR FRESHWATER MUSSELS OFTEN FAILED TO ADDRESS GENETIC STATUS OF BROODSTOCK FEMALES, CAPTIVE REARED STOCKS, AND BOTH SOURCE AND RECIPIENT POPULATIONS. WITHOUT PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF GENETIC VARIABILITY AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS, CAPTIVE PROPAGATION AND SUBSEQUENT RELEASE WOULD NOT ONLY WASTE LIMITED RESOURCES BUT ALSO HARM THE EXISTING POPULATIONS AND ECOSYSTEMS.

CONTINUED POPULATION MONITORING AT CANYON LAKE WILL ALSO AID IN BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS OF ZEBRA MUSSELS AT THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THEIR RANGE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT INVASION AND IMPACT POTENTIAL. FUNDING FROM THIS GRANT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO SUPPORTING CONTRACTOR TIME, TRAVEL, AND SUPPLIES TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS AND FACILITATE EXPANSION OF SAMPLING EFFORTS.PREVENTION IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR MANAGING AQUATIC INVASIONS AND EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN PREVENTION. THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE IN TEXAS DUE TO A LACK OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY OR RESOURCES FOR IMPLEMENTING WATERCRAFT INSPECTION AND DECONTAMINATION PROGRAMS TO DIRECTLY PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE MOST PROBLEMATIC ANS. TEXAS IMPLEMENTS A CUTTING-EDGE OUTREACH CAMPAIGN EACH YEAR TO SEEK TO ENCOURAGE ANS PREVENTION BEHAVIORS, LEVERAGING STATE, PARTNER, AND FEDERAL FUNDS FOR MAXIMUM REACH.

ZEBRA MUSSELS, HYDRILLA, INVASIVE CARP, GOLDEN ALGA, YELLOW FLOATING HEART, AMONG OTHERS HAVE ALREADY BECOME ESTABLISHED IN OKLAHOMA'S LAKES AND RIVERS. THESE SPECIES AS WELL AS SPECIES IN NEIGHBORING STATES POSE ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL THREATS TO THE STATE'S AQUATIC RESOURCES. BIGHEADED CARP (SILVER AND BIGHEAD CARP) HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN THE LOWER RED RIVER WATERSHED AND ITS TRIBUTARIES SINCE AT LEAST 2012 AND BIGHEAD CARP IN THE NEOSHO RIVER/GRAND LAKE SYSTEM SINCE 1992.WHEN POSSIBLE, WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND COORDINATION BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND STATE AGENCY COLLABORATORS. BOTH SYSTEMS ARE ACTIVELY BEING STUDIED AND WE ANTICIPATE RESEARCH RESULTS TO ASSIST FUTURE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AS WELL AS INVASIVE SPECIES IMPLICATIONS ON OTHER NATIVE SPECIES. WE EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR EARLY DETECTION SAMPLING FOR ZEBRA MUSSELS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BY SURVEYING 29 WATER BODIES DURING THE CALENDAR YEAR 2022. PLANKTON SAMPLES WILL BE SENT TO THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION LAB IN DENVER, COLORADO FOR ANALYSIS USING LIGHT MICROSCOPY AND PCR TECHNIQUES. OBTAINING RESULTS FROM PLANKTON SAMPLES WILL HELP INFORM IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY NEW WATER BODIES CONTAMINATED WITH ZEBRA MUSSELS. IF THERE ARE NEW CONTAMINATIONS, WE PLAN TO INFORM THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS OTHER ASSOCIATED AGENCIES TO HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD OF ZEBRA MUSSELS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATES OR EVEN OTHER STATES. THE AQUATIC NUISANCE SPECIES PROGRAM ASSISTS WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC INVASIVE PLANTS SUCH AS HYDRILLA, YELLOW FLOATING HEART, AND ALLIGATOR WEED. WE PLAN TO ASSIST WATER BODY MANAGERS WITH SURVEYS, TREATMENT AND CONTROL INVASIVE AQUATIC VEGETATION THAT COULD RESULT IN INCREASED INVASION OR SPREAD TO OTHER WATER BODIES. IF ESTABLISHED, INVASIVE AQUATIC PLANTS COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC HARM BY CAUSING UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCES FOR ANGLERS OR RECREATIONAL USERS.

BASIN. THIS ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT FURBEARING SPECIES IS ALSO CULTURALLY SIGNIFICANT ACROSS NORTH AMERICA, INCLUDING WITHIN THE GREAT LAKES BASIN. AS A RESULT OF FORAGING BEHAVIORS THOUGHT TO LIMIT THE EXPANSION OF INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES AND PROMOTE WETLAND HETEROGENEITY, MUSKRATS POSITIVELY AFFECT WETLAND BIODIVERSITY IN WETLANDS WHICH THEY OCCUPY. THUS, THIS HISTORICALLY COMMON SPECIES MAY BE CONSIDERED AN ECOSYSTEM ENGINEER IN WETLAND COMMUNITIES. CONTINUED DECLINES IN MUSKRAT POPULATIONS WILL LIKELY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON MUSKRAT TRAPPERS, WETLAND BIODIVERSITY, AND OVERALL WETLAND CONSERVATION THAT WILL LAST DECADES. UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES OF LOCAL POPULATION DECLINES WILL BE CRITICAL FOR INFORMING MANAGEMENT AND POPULATION RECOVERY AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL IN THE GREAT LAKES BASIN AND POSSIBLY BEYOND.REASONS FOR LONG-TERM REGIONAL DECLINES OF MUSKRAT POPULATIONS, INCLUDING IN THE GREAT LAKES BASIN, REMAIN UNKNOWN TO WILDLIFE PROFESSIONALS, TRAPPERS, AND OTHER INTERESTED GROUPS. HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES HAVE REVEALED DIFFERENCES IN MUSKRAT POPULATION HEALTH AND DISEASE RISKS BETWEEN REGIONS WITH RELATIVELY PRISTINE WETLAND HABITATS  I.E., VOYAGEURS NATIONAL PARK, NORTHERN MN  AND HEAVILY DEGRADED WETLAND HABITATS  I.E., CENTRAL IL . IN ONE OF THE FIRST EFFORTS TO EVALUATE MUSKRAT DECLINES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GREAT LAKE BASIN, THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM OUR PREVIOUSLY GREAT LAKES FISH AND WILDLIFE RESTORATION ACT FUNDED PROPOSAL,  ASSESSING THE VALUE OF AN INDICATOR SPECIES FOR WETLAND QUALITY, CONNECTIVITY, AND WILDLIFE IN THE GREAT LAKES BASIN , PROVIDED A FOUNDATION FOR A FOCUSED INVESTIGATION FOR THESE POPULATION DECLINES. IN THAT PROPOSAL, WE COLLECTED, ORGANIZED, AND ANALYZED NUMEROUS LARGE-SCALE DATASETS TO ASSESS POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT MUSKRAT POPULATIONS OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE GREAT LAKES BASIN. OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED AT LEAST TWO UNDERLYING DRIVERS OF MUSKRAT POPULATION DYNAMICS  AS INDEXED BY HARVEST   MULTI-YEAR DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND VEGETATIVE DISTURBANCE WITHIN WETLANDS  AS BROADLY MEASURED USING A FLORISTIC QUALITY INDEX . DEGRADATION OF WETLAND QUALITY, THROUGH DROUGHT AND ALTERED VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS, CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT MUSKRAT HEALTH AND REPRODUCTION, BOTH IMPORTANT TO MUSKRAT POPULATION GROWTH.GIVEN THE POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSKRAT POPULATIONS AND THESE FACTORS, THE NEXT STEP IN OUR INVESTIGATION IS A FIELD-BASED EFFORT TO COLLECT DATA ON MUSKRAT POPULATION HEALTH AND DEMOGRAPHY ACROSS A GRADIENT OF DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND VEGETATIVE DISTURBANCES THROUGHOUT THE GREAT LAKES BASIN. THESE DATA WILL HELP UNCOVER MECHANISTIC EXPLANATIONS FOR OBSERVED POPULATION DECLINES AND ALSO HELP INFORM REGIONAL MANAGEMENT EFFORTS FOR MUSKRAT POPULATIONS AND WETLAND COMPLEXES. OUR GOAL IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW WETLAND CONDITION  DETERMINED BY DROUGHT AND VEGETATION DISTURBANCES  IMPACT THE POPULATION STRUCTURE, REPRODUCTION, AND HEALTH OF MUSKRATS USING INFORMATION FROM CARCASSES COLLECTED FROM WETLAND SITES POSITIONED ACROSS A GRADIENT WETLAND QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE GREAT LAKES BASIN. OUR OBJECTIVES INCLUDE 1. TO ASSESS POPULATION STRUCTURE BASED ON SEX AND AGE RATIOS OF HARVESTED MUSKRATS.2. TO ASSESS REPRODUCTION BASED ON EXAMINATIONS OF CARCASSES OF FEMALE AND MALE MUSKRATS.3. TO ASSESS INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION-LEVEL HEALTH BASED ON BODY-FAT CONTENT AND OR LEVELS OF CONTAMINANTS.4. TO COLLECT SITE-SPECIFIC WETLAND DATA, INCLUDING FLORISTIC QUALITY INDEX AND OTHER VARIABLES  E.G., HUT COUNTS  ASSOCIATED WITH WETLAND CONDITION AND INCORPORATE THESE VARIABLES INTO ALL ANALYSES.TO

ADDITIONALLY, REMOVING THE ALBRIGHT POWER STATION DAM WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE IN ALBRIGHT, WV, AS THE STRUCTURE IS OVER 70 YEARS OLD AND NO LONGER SERVES A PURPOSE. SPECIFICALLY, THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO COMPLETE DESIGN AND PERMITTING FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE ALBRIGHT POWER STATION DAM AND REMOVE THE DAM AND RESTORE THE ADJACENT RIVER REACH. THE DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES CAN BE DESCRIBED AS THE FOLLOWING: 1 AQUATIC ORGANISM PASSAGE BARRIER RECTIFIED, 75 MILES OF RIVER RECONNECTED, 1.25 MILES OF IN-STREAM HABITAT RESTORED, AND 7 MILES OF RIVER OPENED FOR PUBLIC ACCESS. FUNDS FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE USED TO CONTRACT THE FOLLOWING SERVICES: ENGINEERING AND CONSULTING SERVICES THAT RESULT IN 100% PLANS FOR REMOVAL AND RESTORATION, LEGAL SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRING THE DAM AND ADJACENT PROPERTY FOR REMOVAL AND STREAM BANK RESTORATION, AND DEMOLITION/CONSTRUCTION SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH REMOVING THE DAM AND RESTORING THE RIVER REACH.
