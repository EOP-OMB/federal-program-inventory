THE CTSI ACCOMPLISHES THESE GOALS BY CATALYZING THE DEVELOPMENT, DEMONSTRATION, AND DISSEMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND OPERATIONAL INNOVATIONS THAT IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND QUALITY OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH. THIS IS DONE THROUGH BIDIRECTIONAL ENGAGEMENT OF DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING PATIENT ADVOCATES AND COMMUNITY COLLABORATORS, TO HELP IDENTIFY GAPS, CHALLENGES, AND CHOKEPOINTS IN THE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROCESS. IN RESPONSE, THE CTSI DEVELOPS AND TEST STAKEHOLDER-DRIVEN RESOURCES, TOOLS, AND INTERVENTIONS ULTIMATELY PROMOTING THE ADOPTION AND INTEGRATION OF THOSE THAT ARE DEMONSTRATED TO BE SUCCESSFUL, THROUGH DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS. THIS WORK IS SHAPED BY THREE PRIMARY FACTORS: 1) SOFL IS CHARACTERIZED BY COMPLEX AND MULTIFACETED DIVERSITY WITH RESPECT TO RACE, ETHNICITY, LANGUAGE, IMMIGRANT STATUS, SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE, AND STIGMATIZATION. THIS COMPLEXITY ALLOWS CTSI HUB INVESTIGATORS TO EXPLORE RESEARCH QUESTIONS DIFFICULT TO CONCEPTUALIZE AND EVALUATE ELSEWHERE; 2) CTSI PRIORITIZES DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND ACCESSIBILITY (DEIA) IN ITS SCIENTIFIC WORKFORCE AND RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS; AND 3) CTSI HAS A STRONG, SUCCESSFUL AND SUSTAINED RECORD OF AUTHENTIC COMMUNITY AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WHICH FACILITATES MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH THAT CAN SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOME THE TRANSLATIONAL PITFALL OF REPLICATING EXISTING INEQUITIES. THE CTSI\u2019S FOCUS, SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES AND AIMS ARE GROUNDED IN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE FACTORS AND THEIR COMPLEX INTERPLAY WITH ONE ANOTHER. TOGETHER WITH DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS, THE CTSI WILL: 1) SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISSEMINATION OF INNOVATIVE RESOURCES AND SERVICES TO INCREASE THE QUALITY, EFFICIENCY, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RESEARCH ACROSS THE ENTIRE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH SPECTRUM; 2) PROMOTE RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS AIMED AT FACILITATING AND ACCELERATING RESEARCH TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH, ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES, AND PROMOTE HEALTH EQUITY; 3) DEVELOP INNOVATIVE TRAINING PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT A TEAM SCIENCE-ORIENTED CTS WORKFORCE, FROM TRANSLATIONAL SCIENTISTS TO CLINICAL RESEARCH PROFESSIONALS AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS; AND 4) SUPPORT CTS RESEARCH RESPONSIVE TO THESE OVERARCHING GOALS. THROUGH THESE EFFORTS, THE CTSI EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY, SAFETY, EFFICIENCY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND INFORMATIVENESS OF ITS CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL ENTERPRISE. THE CTSI WILL THEN BROADLY DISSEMINATE ITS ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE REGIONALLY AND NATIONALLY TO MAXIMIZE IMPACT AND OPPORTUNITY, BOTH NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. BY DOING SO, THE CTSI ACCELERATES BRINGING THE BENEFITS OF TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE (MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS, DRUGS, DEVICES, BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, AND MEDICAL PROCEDURES) TO ALL PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR IDENTITY OR ACCESS.

CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE, WHICH IS CAUSED BY A NOVEL AND HIGHLY PATHOGENIC VIRUS STRAIN SARS-COV-2 (SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY VIRUS SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2). THE INFECTION MAY CAUSE SEVERE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION WITH ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS AND EXTRAPULMONARY ORGAN DISFUNCTIONS IN INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. TREATMENT STRATEGY THAT BOTH LIMITS SARS-COV-2 REPLICATION AND REDUCE INFLAMMATION ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 WOULD PROVIDE THE GREATEST THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT. POLYAMINES ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING ORGANIC CATIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH PROKARYOTIC AND EUKARYOTIC CELLS. MANY VIRUSES REQUIRE HOST POLYAMINES FOR REPLICATION IN THE INFECTED CELLS AND TARGETING POLYAMINE METABOLISM DURING VIRAL INFECTION SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS IN IN VITRO AND IN VIVO ANIMAL STUDIES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO TEST THE APPLICABILITY OF TWO CURRENTLY FDA APPROVED DRUGS, EFLORNITHINE (OTHER NAME A-DIFLUOROMETHYLORNITHINE OR DFMO) AND SULINDAC, AND THEIR COMBINATION FOR PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF COVID-19 DISEASE. EFTORNITHINE IS AN IRREVERSIBLE INHIBITOR OF A KEY POLYAMINE BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYME ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE (ODC). SULINDAC IS A COMMON NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG (NSAIDS), WHICH ALSO INDUCES POLYAMINE CATABOLISM. EFLORNITHINE AND SULINDAC WORK IN A COMPLEMENTARY MANNER TO REDUCE INTRACELLULAR POLYAMINE LEVELS. THE SAFETY DOSES OF EFLORNITHINE/SULINDAC COMBINATION HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE OF HIGH-RISK ADENOMAS (CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER NCT00118365). IN THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EFLORNITHINE AND SULINDAC COMBINATION WILL REDUCE BOTH THE INTRACELLULAR POLYAMINE AVAILABILITY FOR CORONAVIRUS REPLICATION, AND INFLAMMATION ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS USING CELL CULTURE MODELS (SPECIFIC AIM 1) AND MOUSE MODELS OF COVID-19 DISEASE (SPECIFIC AIM 2). PLANNING ACTIVITIES IN PREPARATION FOR CLINICAL TRIALS FOR EFLORNITHINE/SULINDAC COMBINATION FOR ANTIVIRAL INDICATION IN COLLABORATION WITH CANCER PREVENTION PHARMACEUTICALS (CPP) (WWW.CANPREVENT.COM) ARE ALSO INCLUDED. THE TRANSLATIONAL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP THE EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR PREVENTION COVID-19 INFECTION AS WELL AS DECREASING SEVERITY OF THE VIRAL INFECTION IN THE COVID-19 PATIENTS.

IT IS ALSO HETEROGENEOUS WITH COMPLEX SUB-DISEASE PHENOTYPES (I.E., STRICTURES, FISTULA, ABSCESSES, AND COLITIS-ASSOCIATED CANCERS). CURRENTLY, PATIENTS ARE OFFERED INFLAMMATION-REDUCING THERAPIES THAT HAVE ONLY A ~30-40% RESPONSE- RATE, AND 40% OF RESPONDERS BECOME REFRACTORY TO TREATMENT WITHIN ONE YEAR 2. LITTLE TO NOTHING HAS EMERGED THAT CAN FUNDAMENTALLY TACKLE THE MOST WIDELY RECOGNIZED INDICATOR/PREDICTOR OF DISEASE RELAPSE, RESPONSE AND REMISSION 3-8, I.E., A COMPROMISED EPITHELIAL BARRIER. AMONG THE REASONS CITED ARE- 1) INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF HOST-MICROBE INTERACTIONS IN THE GUT, AND 2) OUR THEORETICAL INABILITY TO PINPOINT SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL, ACTIONABLE AND EFFECTIVE TARGET TO DRIVE A COMPLEX AND NEBULOUS PROCESS OF GUT BARRIER PERMEABILITY.  PRELIMINARY STUDIES USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATASETS FROM ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH IBD AND A SET OF UNBIASED NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES (BOOLEAN IMPLICATION RELATIONSHIPS AND BOOLEAN IMPLICATION NETWORKS) HAVE PINPOINTED A NOVEL TARGET, WHOSE ACTIVATION IS PREDICTED TO ENHANCE A BONA-FIDE BARRIER-PROTECTIVE PATHWAY, AND THEREBY, RESTORE THE GUT BARRIER ACROSS THE TWO SUBTYPES OF IBD, DESPITE DISEASE HETEROGENEITY. EXPRESSION PHARMACOLOGY STUDIES USING A COMPANION BIOMARKER IN FFPE HUMAN TISSUES CONFIRMED THAT THE BARRIER-PROTECTIVE PATHWAY ORCHESTRATED BY THIS TARGET IS SILENCED IN PATIENTS WITH IBD. USING A POTENT AND HIGHLY SPECIFIC DRUG THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED FOR ANOTHER INDICATION AND FOUND TO BE SAFE IN PHASE I TRIALS ON HEALTHY HUMAN ADULTS, PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE HAS BEEN OBTAINED WHICH SHOWS THAT ACTIVATION OF THE TARGET IS NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT TO TRIGGER THE BARRIER-PROTECTIVE PATHWAY, AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE EPITHELIAL BARRIER IN MICE (CHEMICAL-INDUCED COLITIS MODELS) AND IN MURINE AND HUMAN ORGANOID-MONOLAYERS CHALLENGED WITH LIVE MICROBES; IT ALSO RESTORED THE LEAKY GUT BARRIER OBSERVED IN IBD PATIENT-DERIVED ORGANOIDS.

NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD) IS A MAJOR HEALTH CRISIS WITH NO APPROVED THERAPEUTICS AND MANY FAILURES IN THE CLINIC. THE PREVALENCE OF NAFLD IS ESTIMATED TO INCREASE FROM 25% OF THE US POPULATION IN 2015 (~83 MILLION) TO OVER 100 MILLION BY 2030, ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS (NASH), THE PROGRESSIVE FORM OF THE DISEASE, THAT CAN LEAD TO CIRRHOSIS WITH LIVER FAILURE AND HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC). DESPITE ITS PUBLIC HEALTH IMPORTANCE, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO FDA-APPROVED THERAPY FOR ANY STAGE OF NAFLD. NAFLD/NASH IS A COMPLEX HETEROGENEOUS DISORDER INVOLVING MULTIPLE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS. DEVELOPMENT OF EFFICACIOUS PHARMACOTHERAPY HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY THE LIMITED UTILITY OF PRECLINICAL DRUG TESTING MODELS.

WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE OVERALL HYPOTHESIS THAT AZD0328 WILL REDUCE INFLAMMATION IN RATS FOLLOWING TBI (PRIMARY OUTCOME). FURTHER, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT AZD0328 WILL REDUCE BBB PERMEABILITY, BRAIN PATHOLOGY AND IMPROVE COGNITIVE OUTCOME. IF BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ARE OBSERVED, WE WILL PROCEED TO THE PLANNING OF A PHASE II EFFICACY STUDY. WE PROPOSE TWO AIMS TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS: AIM 1 (UG3): TO EXAMINE IF AZD0328 REDUCES PERIPHERAL AND CENTRAL INFLAMMATION AND IMPROVES OUTCOME IN TRAUMATICALLY BRAIN INJURED RATS. AIM 2 (UH3): CLINICAL TRIAL PLANNING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null,

THERAPEUTICS - PROJECT SUMMARY: RATES OF FDA APPROVAL FOR ONCOLOGY DRUGS IN CLINICAL TRIALS ARE LOW AND OFTEN CLINICAL TRIAL FAILURES ARE DRIVEN BY PRE-SCREENING OF THERAPIES IN MODELS THAT CANNOT ADEQUATELY REPLICATE PATIENT PHYSIOLOGY. THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT (TME) IS HIGHLY COMPLEX CONSISTING OF MULTIPLE CELL TYPES INCLUDING STROMAL CELLS, IMMUNE CELLS AND VASCULATURE. THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN TUMOR CELLS AND NEIGHBORING CELLS IN THE TME RESULTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES THAT CAN SUPPORT TUMOR GROWTH, VASCULARIZATION AND METASTASIS AND, THUS, PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROGNOSIS AND TREATMENT EFFICACY (E.G. BY MODULATING RESISTANCE). IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CLINICAL PRESCREENING MODELS TO INCLUDE THE TME TO ASSESS HOW TREATMENT EFFICACY CAN BE IMPACTED BY THIS MULTICELLULAR CROSSTALK. FOR MEN WITH ADVANCED CASTRATE RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER (CRPC) THAT HAVE PROGRESSED TO METASTASIS, THE DISEASE IS INVARIABLY LETHAL AS CURRENT THERAPIES ARE NOT CURATIVE. 90% OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE DEVELOPED BONE METASTASES BUT THE BONE MICROENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY DIFFICULT TO MODEL IN ANIMAL MODELS OR TRADITIONAL CO-CULTURE. THEREFORE, IN VITRO MODELS OF THE BONE MARROW TME ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO IMPROVE PRE-SCREENING OF NOVEL THERAPEUTICS, IMPROVE CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN, OUTCOMES AND EXPEDITE MUCH NEEDED TREATMENTS TO THE CLINIC. HERE WE PROPOSE TO CREATE A TISSUE CHIP MODEL OF THE BONE MARROW MICROENVIRONMENT FOR TESTING METASTATIC CRPC THERAPEUTICS. PATIENT-DERIVED PROSTATE TUMOR SPHEROIDS MODEL THE SOLID TUMOR EMBEDDED IN A COLLAGEN HYDROGEL SURROUNDED BY MULTIPLE RESIDENT BONE MARROW STROMAL CELLS DERIVED FROM BONE MARROW ASPIRATES, IMMUNE CELLS AND IPSC ENDOTHELIAL CELL VASCULATURE. CELL-SURFACE TARGETED THERAPIES, SUCH AS IMMU-132 HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR TREATMENT OF METASTATIC CANCERS. IMMU-132 IS AN ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE, WITH AN ANTIBODY AGAINST TROP 2, A RECEPTOR EXPRESSED ON TUMOR CELLS, COUPLED TO THE DRUG SN-38. SN-38 IS A TOPOISOMERASE INHIBITOR THAT INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN RAPIDLY PROLIFERATING CELLS. WE HAVE ACCESS TO SAMPLES AND DATA FROM A PHASE II TRIAL OF IMMU-132 IN METASTATIC CRPC WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO VALIDATE OUR BONE MARROW TISSUE CHIP MODEL. IN THE UG3 PHASE, WE WILL OPTIMIZE OUR BONE MARROW TISSUE CHIP MODEL AND DEMONSTRATE THAT NORMAL AND DISEASE CHIP ENVIRONMENTS REPLICATE THE IN VIVO PHYSIOLOGY. WE WILL ALSO VALIDATE THE CHIP FOR MEASURING RESPONSES TO CELL SURFACE TARGETED THERAPIES. IN THE UH3, WE WILL USE CLINICAL TRIAL DATA TO BUILD TISSUE CHIPS THAT REPRESENT PATIENTS WHO RESPOND AND DO NOT RESPOND TO IMMU-132 AND VALIDATE THESE MODELS. THESE CHIPS WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE MECHANISMS OF TME-INDUCED TREATMENT RESISTANCE AND IDENTIFY SIGNATURES OF RESPONSE FOR USE IN STRATIFYING PATIENTS FOR MORE EFFICIENT CLINICAL TRIALS. THE CHIPS CAN ALSO BE USED TO SCREEN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT CELL-SURFACE TARGETED THERAPIES HELPING DIRECT THERAPY CHOICE IN FUTURE TRIALS. THE BONE MARROW TISSUE CHIPS CAN BE EASILY ADAPTED FOR ANY CANCER TYPE THAT HAS BONE METASTASES AND CAN MEASURE A RANGE OF CELL SURFACE TARGETED THERAPIES.

DESPITE MAJOR INVESTMENTS BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, THERE ARE NO APPROVED DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF NAFLD, PROBABLY REFLECTING THE HETEROGENEOUS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY INVOLVING MULTIPLE PATHWAYS. WE HAVE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED THE HUMAN BIOMIMETIC, VASCULARIZED LIVER ACINUS MICROPHYSIOLOGY SYSTEM (VLAMPS) USING ALL-HUMAN PRIMARY LIVER CELLS (HEPATOCYTES, LIVER SINUSOIDAL ENDOTHELIAL, STELLATE AND KUPFFER CELLS) FROM THE SAME GENOTYPED PATIENTS IN A NAFLD EXPERIMENTAL MODEL. WE HAVE INITIATED THE TESTING OF MORE THAN 100 DRUGS AND DRUG COMBINATIONS RECENTLY PREDICTED THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF QUANTITATIVE SYSTEMS PHARMACOLOGY (QSP). WE HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING TOWARD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL IPSC-DERIVED LIVER CELLS FROM THE SAME PATIENTS THAT WILL BE COMPLETED AT THE TIME OF STARTING THE PROPOSED STUDY. THE USE OF PATIENT- SPECIFIC IPSC-DERIVED CELLS IS CRITICAL TO PRODUCE REPRODUCIBLE PATIENT COHORTS FOR PRECISION MEDICINE.

THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT HIGH CONTENT AND THROUGHPUT NAFLD MPS MODELS BASED ON IPSC-DERIVED CELLS THAT DEMONSTRATE MAXIMAL REPRODUCIBILITY. THE GOAL OF THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH DRUG DISCOVERY INSTITUTE (UPDDI) AND THE NCATS 3D TISSUE BIOPRINTING LABORATORY (3DTBL) IS TO HARNESS THE LIVER ACINUS DESIGN INTO A HIGHER THROUGHPUT BIOMIMETIC BY DEVELOPING A BIOPRINTED ALL-IPS PLATE-BASED, NAFLD MODEL TO MAXIMIZE THROUGHPUT OF TESTING THE PREDICTED DRUGS AND COMBINATIONS, MODEL FUNCTIONALITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY WITH SELECTED PRIMARY SCREEN METRICS.

CURRENT INTERVENTIONS IN PTB ARE DESIGNED TO STOP MATERNAL UTERINE CONTRACTIONS TO DELAY DELIVERY BUT HAVE LIMITED SUCCESS. INFECTION AND HOST INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES ARE THE MAJOR FACTORS PREDISPOSING TO PTB. INFLAMMATION OF THE FETO-MATERNAL INTERFACE (FMI), SPECIFICALLY AT THE CHORIO- DECIDUAL INTERFACE, IN RESPONSE TO VARIOUS RISK FACTORS CAN COMPROMISE IMMUNE TOLERANCE THAT MAINTAINS PREGNANCY, AMPLIFY INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE, AND TRIGGER PATHWAYS OF PTB. MULTIPLE DRUGS IN PRECLINICAL TRIALS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND DELAY PTB. HOWEVER, CHALLENGES IN TESTING DRUG TRANSPORT, METABOLIC CHANGES, AND TERATOGENICITY HAVE HINDERED PTB DRUG DEVELOPMENT. UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT IN VITRO CELL CULTURE MODELS AND ANIMAL MODELS HAVE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS, AND FOCUS IS GIVEN ONLY TO PLACENTAL TRANSPORT OF DRUGS. TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPING SEVERAL TISSUE CHIP MODELS OF THE FMI USING PRIMARY HUMAN CELLS AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY CAN RECAPITULATE THE FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSES OF HEALTHY AND DISEASE STATES OF THE FMIS.

DESORPTION ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION (DESI) IS AN AMBIENT IONIZATION METHOD IN WHICH SAMPLES ARE ANALYZED IN THE OPEN AIR BY IMPACT OF PRIMARY DROPLETS. GIVEN THE ABILITY TO POSITION AN ARRAY OF SAMPLES RELATIVE TO THE MASS SPECTROMETER, DESI-MS BECOMES A HIGH THROUGHPUT (HT) CHEMICAL ANALYSIS METHOD. THE POWER OF MS AS AN ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE IS WELL KNOWN BUT IT IS LESS COMMONLY REALIZED THAT MS CAN ALSO SERVE AS A PREPARATIVE METHOD, E.G. IT CAN BE USED TO DEPOSIT MASS-SELECTED IONS ON SURFACES TO CREATE NEW MATERIALS IN VACUO. OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST TO ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, A UNIQUE FEATURE OF DESI IS THAT, UPON IMPACT, THE SPRAY OF SOLVENT USED TO ANALYZE A REACTION MIXTURE GENERATES SECONDARY MICRODROPLETS IN WHICH REACTIONS MAY BE ACCELERATED EN ROUTE TO THE MASS SPECTROMETER. IT IS THIS REMARKABLE FEATURE THAT MAKES DESI- MS A POWERFUL SYNTHETIC METHOD COMBINED WITH A BUILT-IN ANALYTICAL CAPABILITY.

IN SOME CASES, THERAPEUTICS THAT TARGET SPECIFIC IMMUNE PATHWAYS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR OTHER INDICATIONS AND MAY HAVE CLINICAL UTILITY IN PATIENTS WITH MOLECULAR DEFECTS IN THOSE IMMUNE PATHWAYS.

THIS PARTNERSHIP IS FUNDED BY AN NIH CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE AWARD UL1 PROGRAM PROVIDING A ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE PROPOSED STUDIES. AIM 1 (UG3 PHASE) FOCUSES ON TRANSLATIONAL MELAS AND LHON-PLUS STUDIES AND SUBMISSION OF AN IND PROTOCOL TO THE FDA. AIM 2 (UH3 PHASE)FOCUSES ON A BASKET CLINICAL TRIAL WITH MELAS AND LHON-PLUS TO: 1) PROVIDE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT THAT THE BASKET DESIGN CAN BE APPLIED TO DIVERGENT ULTRA-RARE DISEASES; 2) ADVANCE THE DATASET FOR SAFETY AND PHARMACOKINETICS/PHARMACODYNAMICS OF OUR LEAD COMPOUND FOR A LARGER NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAN IN A CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL TRIAL SETTING; AND 3) GATHER OUTCOMES AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION FOR OPTIMIZING THE DESIGN OF FUTURE BASKET CLINICAL TRIAL. OUR INNOVATIVE DESIGN LIES IN APPLYING THE CONCEPT OF BASKET CLINICAL TRIAL NOT ONLY TO MULTIPLE DISEASES WITH A COMMON MOLECULAR TARGET, BUT ALSO TO GROUPS WITH SIMILAR EX-VIVO FIBROBLASTS RESPONSE TO BUTYRATE ACROSS THESE DISEASES TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE OUR THERAPEUTIC DRUG IN ULTRA-RARE DISEASE POPULATIONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ee8636d0-3f78-fbb3-4346-eb49aabbb2b3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UG3TR003897_7529"}, {"internal_id": 116435368, "Award ID": "UG3TR003597", "Award Amount": 613994.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-17", "CFDA Number": "93.350", "Description": "TARGETING POLYAMINES TO SUPPRESS SARS-COV-2 RELATED DISEASE - ABSTRACT THE PANDEMIC CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE, WHICH IS CAUSED BY A NOVEL AND HIGHLY PATHOGENIC VIRUS STRAIN SARS-COV-2 (SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY VIRUS SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2). THE INFECTION MAY CAUSE SEVERE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION WITH ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS AND EXTRAPULMONARY ORGAN DISFUNCTIONS IN INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. TREATMENT STRATEGY THAT BOTH LIMITS SARS-COV-2 REPLICATION AND REDUCE INFLAMMATION ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 WOULD PROVIDE THE GREATEST THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT. POLYAMINES ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING ORGANIC CATIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH PROKARYOTIC AND EUKARYOTIC CELLS. MANY VIRUSES REQUIRE HOST POLYAMINES FOR REPLICATION IN THE INFECTED CELLS AND TARGETING POLYAMINE METABOLISM DURING VIRAL INFECTION SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS IN IN VITRO AND IN VIVO ANIMAL STUDIES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO TEST THE APPLICABILITY OF TWO CURRENTLY FDA APPROVED DRUGS, EFLORNITHINE (OTHER NAME A-DIFLUOROMETHYLORNITHINE OR DFMO) AND SULINDAC, AND THEIR COMBINATION FOR PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF COVID-19 DISEASE. EFTORNITHINE IS AN IRREVERSIBLE INHIBITOR OF A KEY POLYAMINE BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYME ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE (ODC). SULINDAC IS A COMMON NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG (NSAIDS), WHICH ALSO INDUCES POLYAMINE CATABOLISM. EFLORNITHINE AND SULINDAC WORK IN A COMPLEMENTARY MANNER TO REDUCE INTRACELLULAR POLYAMINE LEVELS. THE SAFETY DOSES OF EFLORNITHINE/SULINDAC COMBINATION HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE OF HIGH-RISK ADENOMAS (CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER NCT00118365). IN THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EFLORNITHINE AND SULINDAC COMBINATION WILL REDUCE BOTH THE INTRACELLULAR POLYAMINE AVAILABILITY FOR CORONAVIRUS REPLICATION, AND INFLAMMATION ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS USING CELL CULTURE MODELS (SPECIFIC AIM 1) AND MOUSE MODELS OF COVID-19 DISEASE (SPECIFIC AIM 2). PLANNING ACTIVITIES IN PREPARATION FOR CLINICAL TRIALS FOR EFLORNITHINE/SULINDAC COMBINATION FOR ANTIVIRAL INDICATION IN COLLABORATION WITH CANCER PREVENTION PHARMACEUTICALS (CPP) (WWW.CANPREVENT.COM) ARE ALSO INCLUDED. THE TRANSLATIONAL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP THE EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR PREVENTION COVID-19 INFECTION AS WELL AS DECREASING SEVERITY OF THE VIRAL INFECTION IN THE COVID-19 PATIENTS.

HUMAN INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL (IPSC)-DERIVED MOTOR NEURONS AND MUSCLE CELLS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY MAINTAINED IN CO- CULTURE AND SHOWN TO FORM FUNCTIONAL SYNAPTIC CONTACTS REPRESENTING IN VIVO NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTIONS (NMJS). HOWEVER, THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MODEL NMJ FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES TO BOT USING IN VITRO PLATFORMS AMENABLE TO HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING HAS YET TO BE ACHIEVED DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF GENERATING MATURE AND FUNCTIONALLY COMPETENT NMJS IN CULTURE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH-THROUGHPUT PLATFORM CAPABLE OF PROMOTING NMJ DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A MULTIPLEXED ASSAY WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL POSITIVE IMPACT ON BOT PRODUCTION, AS WELL AS ADVANCED THERAPY DEVELOPMENT, DRUG EFFICACY/TOXICITY SCREENING, AND MECHANISTIC STUDIES OF NEURONAL AND NMJ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. BASED ON PRELIMINARY WORK AND PUBLISHED DATA, WE POSIT THAT A CULTURE PLATFORM INTEGRATING ELECTRODE-BASED STIMULATION OF NEURONAL FIRING AND MAGNET-BASED MEASUREMENT OF ENGINEERED MUSCLE CONTRACTION WILL ENABLE REAL-TIME ANALYSIS OF NMJ DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION AT BASELINE AND IN RESPONSE TO BOT EXPOSURE.

INFLAMMATION IS A KNOWN KEY DRIVER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUES AT HIGH-RISK FOR CAUSING SEVERE CLINICAL EVENTS (SUCH AS MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND STROKE) AND REPRESENTS A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC TARGET TO FURTHER REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK. HOWEVER, UP UNTIL RECENTLY, CLINICAL TRANSLATION OF NEW THERAPIES, OR THE REPURPOSING OF ALREADY FDA-APPROVED DRUGS THAT LOWER CARDIOVASCULAR RISK BY TARGETING INFLAMMATION, HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT. PART OF THE CHALLENGE FACED BY THESE STUDIES IS THAT THESE THERAPEUTIC COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BASED ON SINGLE- TARGET DRUG DISCOVERY. HOWEVER, THE BIOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE OF COMMON COMPLEX DISORDERS, LIKE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, IS BETTER EXPLAINED BY GENE REGULATORY NETWORKS (GRN) ACTING WITHIN AND ACROSS TISSUES. IDENTIFYING NEW USES FOR EXISTING DRUGS TO RESTORE THE FUNCTION OF GRN IN ATHEROSCLEROTIC VESSELS IS A GROUNDBREAKING AND COST- EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO TREAT CVD. USING AN INNOVATIVE AND RIGOROUS COMBINATION OF SYSTEMS GENETICS AND COMPUTATIONAL DRUG REPURPOSING ANALYSES, WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED EXISTING COMPOUNDS PREDICTED TO INFLUENCE THE FUNCTION OF FOUR KEY DRIVER GENES IN RGN 42, A CVD-CAUSAL NETWORK ACTING IN THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC ARTERIAL WALL OF PATIENTS THAT AFFECT FOAM CELL FORMATION.

SINCE LATE DECEMBER 2019, AN OUTBREAK OF A NOVEL ZOONOTIC CORONAVIRUS (SARS-COV-2 / COVID-19) WITH CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS GREATLY RESEMBLING VIRAL PNEUMONIA HAS CLAIMED THE LIVES OF OVER 418,000 WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING OVER 117,000 IN THE U.S. ALONE (AS OF 6/13/2020). COVID-19 IS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, INFECTING OVER 7.4 MILLION PATIENTS GLOBALLY SO FAR, WITH AN AVERAGE INCUBATION PERIOD OF 4 DAYS. FREQUENTLY REPORTED COVID-19 SYMPTOMS INCLUDE FEVER, COUGH, MYALGIA OR FATIGUE, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH. APPROXIMATELY 20-30% OF HOSPITALIZED COVID- 19 PATIENTS HAVE REQUIRED INTENSIVE CARE FOR RESPIRATORY SUPPORT. COVID-19 CAN LEAD TO ACUTE LUNG INJURY, ARDS, MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE AND DEATH. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT COVID-19 HAS A MORTALITY RATE OF UP TO 4.2%. PREDICTORS OF FATAL OUTCOMES INCLUDE AGE, THE PRESENCE OF UNDERLYING DISEASES OR SECONDARY INFECTION, AS WELL AS ELEVATED INFLAMMATORY INDICATORS IN THE BLOOD, AND MORTALITY MAY BE DUE TO VIRUS-ACTIVATED \u201cCYTOKINE STORM SYNDROME\u201d OR FULMINANT MYOCARDITIS. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO VACCINE FOR COVID-19, AND ONLY REMDESIVIR (GILEAD SCIENCES) HAS SHOWN EFFICACY IN A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL, ALONG WITH EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION FROM THE FDA.

CMTX BIOTECH IS WORKING TO REPURPOSE AND COMMERCIALIZE INCYCLINIDE AS A ONCE-DAILY, ORALLY-ADMINISTERED TREATMENT FOR HOSPITALIZED COVID- 19 PATIENTS.

TWO RECENT INDEPENDENT STUDIES PERFORMED IN SILICO HAVE SUGGESTED THAT INCYCLINIDE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19. IMPORTANTLY, THE SAFETY OF INCYCLINIDE HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG (IND)-ENABLING STUDIES, AND INCYCLINIDE HAS BEEN EVALUATED IN A NUMBER OF HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THE TREATMENT OF DISEASES AS DISPARATE AS AIDS- RELATED KAPOSI'S SARCOMA, RECURRENT HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS, REFRACTORY METASTATIC CANCER, ACNE, ROSACEA AND PERIODONTITIS. PUBLISHED PRE-CLINICAL EFFICACY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT SYSTEMIC ADMINISTRATION OF INCYCLINIDE PREVENTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARDS AND SEPTIC SHOCK, AND IMPROVES SURVIVAL IN SEVERAL CHRONIC INSIDIOUS ONSET ANIMAL MODELS OF ARDS ACROSS SEVERAL SPECIES, INCLUDING MICE, RATS, PIGS, AND SHEEP. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO OBTAIN EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA) AND REGULATORY APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO MARKET INCYCLINIDE FOR THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF COVID-19 PATIENTS, AS WELL AS TO ESTABLISH A PARTNERSHIP WITH A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY IN THE FORM OF A LICENSE OR ACQUISITION.

SECOND, THERE IS AN UNMET NEED FOR READILY AVAILABLE, EASILY ACCESSED INFORMATICS TOOLS THAT FACILITATE EHR-BASED RESEARCH AND CAN BE RAPIDLY DISSEMINATED AND IMPLEMENTED ACROSS ALL CTSA HUBS. THIRD, CTSA HUBS SEEK GUIDANCE ON THE COMPLICATED DATA USE AGREEMENTS (DUAS) AND GOVERNANCE NEEDED TO ENABLE DATA SHARING AND ANALYSIS OF SHARED DATA. WITH FUNDING FROM NCATS, WE CREATED A FEDERATED SYSTEM, THE ACT NETWORK, THAT CRAFTED A BROAD DUA AND STOOD-UP LOCAL CLINICAL DATA WAREHOUSES (CDWS) AT 57 CTSA HUBS, CREATED AN INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY TO QUERY THE CDWS THAT INCLUDE >142M PATIENTS, AND DEMOCRATIZED DATA ACCESS FOR COHORT DISCOVERY TO ALL CTSA HUB INVESTIGATORS. WE INITIALLY DEVELOPED ACT TO SUPPORT THE PLANNING AND DESIGN OF MULTISITE CLINICAL TRIALS, WHICH IT DID WELL AND ADDITIONALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF EHR DATA FOR DEEPER ANALYSIS. WHILE THE ACT NETWORK HAS LIMITED ANALYTIC CAPACITY IN ITS PRESENT FORM, WE WILL NOW ADDRESS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE RESEARCH POTENTIAL OF EHR DATA FROM ALMOST HALF THE US POPULATION THROUGH EVOLVE TO NEXT-GEN ACT (ENACT).

CRVS MAKE EXCELLENT DESCRIPTORS FOR SAR/QSAR ITERATION BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN MUCH MORE CHEMICAL INFORMATION IN A SMALL SPACE, ALLOWING THE AUTOMATION OF STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY MODELS TO BE MORE STREAMLINED, RELATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL DESCRIPTORS. THE RESULTING MODELS WILL EXPLORE THE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPACE VIA AN INTERACTIVE VISUAL INTERFACE (HUMAN-DIRECTED) OR A BACK-END ALGORITHM TO CONSTANTLY SEARCH FOR NEW AND BETTER STRUCTURES (MACHINE-DIRECTED). BOTH INTERACTIVE AND AUTOMATED PROCESSES WILL BE CONNECTED BACK INTO THE ASPIRE AUTOMATION CYCLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE SYNTHESIZED AND MEASURED (HYPOTHESIS EVALUATION AND ITERATIVE OPTIMIZATION). THE SECOND MODULE, MACHINE-READABLE REACTIONS, DRAWS FROM OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE DEVELOPING THE BIOHARMONY ANNOTATOR (FORMERLY: BIOASSAY EXPRESS) WHICH USES NATURAL LANGUAGE MODELS TO ASSIGN SEMANTIC ONTOLOGY TERMS TO BIOLOGICAL ASSAY PROTOCOLS, TURNING THEM FROM UNSTRUCTURED TEXT INTO MACHINE-READABLE DATA. EXTRACTING THE FULL CONTENT OF REACTIONS FROM PROTOCOLS AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURE DIAGRAMS IS REMARKABLY DIFFICULT GIVEN THE UNSTRUCTURED NATURE OF TEXT, ABBREVIATIONS, SHORTCUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO DIAGRAMS. IT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE NEED TO CONNECT THE MATERIALS IN THE SCHEME WITH THE REACTION TEXT DESCRIPTION (E.G. REAGENTS, SOLVENTS, THE SEQUENCES INVOLVED IN THE RECIPE, REACTION WORKUP, AND PRODUCT CHARACTERIZATION).

SKIN VOC MONITORING IS A NEW CONCEPT WITH POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM HEALTHCARE. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MINIATURE SKIN VOC ANALYSIS DEVICES CAN BE COUPLED WITH VITAL SIGN SENSORS TO MEASURE DISEASE SIGNATURES IN REAL-TIME FASTER THAN A TRADITIONAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS. THE PROPOSAL HAS FOUR GOALS: (1) ADAPT OUR CURRENT VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC) DETECTOR INTO A HAND-HELD FORMAT FOR GAS PHASE SKIN-EMITTED METABOLITES, COUPLED TO NON-INVASIVE VITAL SIGN SENSORS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MACHINE LEARNING (AI/ML) ALGORITHMS; (2) DEPLOY OUR HAND-HELD SKIN VOC SYSTEM ON 20 DISEASES OVER 5 YEARS; (3) ADAPT OUR CURRENT WEARABLE VITAL MONITORING SYSTEM TO INCLUDE OUR SKIN VOC DETECTOR, AND USE THIS TO MONITOR PERSISTENT ASTHMA PATIENTS FOR DISEASE FLARES; (4) PREPARE FOR OUR PROJECT AND DEVICES TO MOVE THROUGH COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING, STANDARDIZATION AND FDA REGULATORY APPROVAL. TO MEET THESE GOALS, WE PLAN THE FOLLOWING: IN AIM #1, WE ADAPT OUR MINIATURE VOC DETECTION DEVICE FOR SKIN MEASUREMENTS, AND COUPLE IT WITH 7 COMMERCIAL-OFF-THE-SHELF VITAL SIGN SENSORS (SKIN TEMPERATURE, PULSE RATE, RESPIRATION RATE, HEART RATE, OXYGEN SATURATION, GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE, SKIN HUMIDITY). OUR MINIATURE DIFFERENTIAL MOBILITY SPECTROMETRY DETECTOR IS COUPLED WITH A CHIP-BASED PRECONCENTRATOR AND MINIATURE GAS CHROMATOGRAPH COLUMN FOR CHEMICAL SEPARATION AND DETECTION. INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED. UNDER DIRECTION OF MPI PROF. DAVIS, UC DAVIS CHAIR OF MECHANICAL AND AEROSPACE ENGINEERING, A TEAM OF ENGINEERS WILL ADAPT THESE PIECES TOGETHER INTO A HAND-HELD UNIT FOR SKIN VOC SAMPLING/ANALYSIS. CO-I PROF.

WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SYSTEMIC METABOLIC DERANGEMENTS IN MANY HIGH BURDEN INFECTIOUS, INFLAMMATORY, METABOLIC, MALIGNANT, PSYCHIATRIC, AND NEUROLOGIC DISEASES CAN BE IDENTIFIED VIA SKIN EMISSIONS. WE WILL ADAPT A NOVEL, PORTABLE GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY- DIFFERENTIAL MOBILITY SPECTROMETRY (GC-DMS) DEVICE THAT RAPIDLY EXAMINES VOLATILE SAMPLES DIRECTLY AT THE POINT OF CARE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THESE SKIN VOLATILE METABOLITE SIGNATURES. THIS DEVICE IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE, ALLOWING A COMPREHENSIVE AND BIOLOGICALLY REPRESENTATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN VOLATILE EMISSIONS, IS MORE ROBUST TO CONFOUNDING AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAN MANY OTHER GAS SENSING DEVICES, HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL USE IN VARIOUS REAL-WORLD SENSING APPLICATIONS, AND IS ALREADY UNDERGOING COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WILL GREATLY FACILITATE ITS RAPID DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SKIN VOC-BASED DIAGNOSIS OF THESE 20 DISEASE STATES. WE PROPOSE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND RIGOROUS EVALUATION OF THIS SCENT-BASED DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH TO THESE DISEASE STATES, (1) INTEGRATING ADDITIONAL PROCESS ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES (PATS) TO ENSURE INSTRUMENTAL ACCURACY AND PRECISION BETWEEN SAMPLES AND DEVICES THROUGH REPEATED, HIGH-VOLUME PATIENT TESTING OVER TIME AND MODIFYING THE DEVICE INLET FOR SKIN VOLATILE ANALYSIS, (2) IDENTIFYING AND VALIDATING GC- DMS SIGNATURES AND THE CORRESPONDING SET OF SKIN VOLATILE METABOLITES THAT DISTINGUISH INDIVIDUALS WITH AND WITHOUT EACH OF THESE 20 DISEASE STATES USING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS, INTEGRATING AUTOMATED DETECTION OF THESE SIGNATURES ON THE GC-DMS DEVICE, AND (3) DEVELOPING A WEARABLE SENSOR FOR AT LEAST ONE DISEASE WITH A SIMPLE VOLATILE SIGNATURE, DETERMINING THE TEST CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS WEARABLE DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE.

CURRENT BODY ODOR ANALYSIS RELIES ON BENCHTOP INSTRUMENTS, BUT THEY ARE TOO BULKY FOR USE AT POINT-OF-CARE, HOME OR WORKPLACE. E-NOSE TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDE A SIMPLE, LIGHT, AND LOW COST ALTERNATIVE FOR BODY ODOR ANALYSIS, BUT THEY ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES (E.G., TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY). ADDITIONALLY, E-NOSE SUFFERS FROM STRONG CROSS-TALK AMONG THE SENSING ELEMENTS WHEN IT IS EXPOSED TO ~100 SKIN-EMITTED VAPOR ANALYTES SIMULTANEOUSLY. THESE DRAWBACKS MAKE E-NOSE PATTERN RECOGNITION DIFFICULT AND INACCURATE. TO OVERCOME THIS, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A WEARABLE MICRO-GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY (GC) DEVICE INTEGRATED WITH GRAPHENE BASED NANO-ELECTRONIC E-NOSE AND VITAL SIGN SENSORS, AND USE IT TO ANALYZE BODY ODORS RELATED TO >20 DISEASES/CONDITIONS. IN THIS WEARABLE DEVICE, SKIN-EMITTED VAPORS WILL BE PRE-SEPARATED BY MICRO-GC AND THEN DETECTED BY THE GRAPHENE E-NOSE EMBEDDED AT THE END OF THE GC COLUMN TO GENERATE TIME-SERIES PATTERNS. BECAUSE VAPOR ANALYTES WILL BE ELUTED OUT ONE OR A FEW AT A TIME, PATTERN RECOGNITION BY E-NOSE WILL BE MUCH SIMPLER AND MORE ACCURATE. THE TEMPERATURE/MOISTURE ISSUES WILL ALSO BE GREATLY REDUCED SINCE THE VAPOR SENSORS ARE INSENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRE-CONCENTRATOR IN THE GC IS HYDROPHOBIC AND DOES NOT TRAP WATER, AND THE REMAINING WATER WILL BE SEPARATED OUT FROM OTHER VAPORS THROUGH GC. FINALLY, THE VAPOR CONCENTRATION INSIDE THE GC COLUMN IS >50X HIGHER THAN NEAR THE SKIN SURFACE DUE TO THE PRE-CONCENTRATION EFFECT. BECAUSE OF THESE ADVANTAGES, THE PATTERN RECOGNITION AND DISEASE DETECTION CAPABILITY WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED. OUR MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM HAS THE NEEDED EXPERTISE IN BIOMEDICAL/ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, DATA SCIENCE, AND A VARIETY OF CLINICAL REALMS INCLUDING DERMATOLOGY, EMERGENCY MEDICINE, PULMONOLOGY, AND PEDIATRICS.

PERSONALIZING ANALGESIA BASED ON GENETIC RISKS WILL REDUCE OPIOID USE, ADVERSE-EFFECTS, AND ACCELERATE VALUE-BASED CARE OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE CONSTRAINED BY LACK OF TRANS- LATIONAL PLATFORMS AND MAJOR GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO PERSONALIZE AND PRECISELY DOSE OPIOIDS. IN THIS COLLABORATIVE CTSA PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO OVERCOME THE TRANSLATIONAL BARRIERS BY DEVELOPING AN INNO- VATIVE PERIOPERATIVE PRECISION ANALGESIA PLATFORM (PPAP) TO REDUCE SERIOUS ADVERSE OUTCOMES OF OPIOIDS, AND IMPROVE SAFETY OF OPIOIDS IN: 1) CHILDREN UNDERGOING PAINFUL SURGERY, AND 2) NURSING MOTHERS AND THEIR INFANTS.

OUR MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM, WHICH SPANS THREE CTSA PROGRAM HUBS (UNC, DUKE, AND UNIV. FLORIDA), HAS DEVELOPED MULTIPLE MODELS FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND SHOWN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OBSC PLATFORM TO DISCOVER NEW MECHANISMS OF DISEASE AND IDENTIFY NEW THERAPEUTIC COMPOUNDS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS FOR OBSC MODELING, INCLUDING ELEVATED-THROUGHPUT TECHNIQUES FOR BRAIN SLICING, VIRAL- AND BIOLISTIC-BASED TRANSDUCTION OF DISEASE-RELEVANT GENES, TARGETED GENE KNOCKDOWN, REAL-TIME MONITORING USING REPORTER ASSAYS, AND INCORPORATION OF FRESH PATIENT TISSUE.

RESEARCH GAP: THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP THE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS VIA NETWORKED DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHMS (PANDA) FRAMEWORK, WHICH WILL ENABLE ACCURATE RISK PREDICTION TO HELP HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS REACH ACCURATE DIAGNOSES EARLIER. OUR PROPOSED METHODS DIRECTLY ADDRESS TWO MAJOR BARRIERS: 1) LACK OF PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR MULTI-SYSTEM CONDITIONS; 2) LACK OF ALGORITHMS THAT EFFECTIVELY COMBINE DATA FROM MULTIPLE SITES IN A PRIVACY-PRESERVING AND COMMUNICATION-EFFICIENT FASHION. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL DEVELOP AND EVALUATE THE PANDA FRAMEWORK USING TWO PROTOTYPIC MULTI-SYSTEM CONDITIONS, WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PREVALENCE: GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS (GPA, A TYPE OF VASCULITIS, PREVALENCE OF 74 PER MILLION) AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS (PSA) (1500 PER MILLION), WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE APPROACH WILL BE READILY APPLICABLE TO OTHER DISEASES. THESE TWO CONDITIONS ARE PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PREDICTIVE METHODS GIVEN THE COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED DELAYS IN DIAGNOSIS THAT CAN RANGE FROM MONTHS TO YEARS. THESE DELAYS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH MORBIDITY AND EARLY MORTALITY. WE HAVE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1. DEVELOP PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS, AND DATA  INTEGRATION ALGORITHMS TO ENABLE SECURE AND EFFICIENT DATA SHARING AMONG MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS.

WHILE THE PRECISE NATURE OF FUTURE BIOMEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES CANNOT BE KNOWN, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE COUNTRY DEPENDS ON A ROBUST PIPELINE OF SCIENTISTS WITH DIVERSE EXPERTISE, WHO ARE WELL TRAINED IN CORE COMPETENCIES ACROSS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE (CTS). IT IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT TRAINING RESEARCHERS OUTSIDE OF THEIR NARROW FIELD OF SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIZATION, TO INCLUDE A MORE VARIED SET OF RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL SKILLS\u2014PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO LATER TRANSLATIONAL PHASES\u2014IS CRITICAL TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE TO TRANSFORM HUMAN HEALTH AND RESPOND TO NEW CHALLENGES. THESE AREAS HAVE LONG BEEN SIGNATURE STRENGTHS OF THE TUFTS CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE (CTS) GRADUATE PROGRAM, THE TRAINING CORE OF TUFTS CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE INSTITUTE (CTSI).

AS THE WORLD EMERGES FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE CASE FOR ENGAGING TRAINEES IN CTS RESEARCH EARLIER IN THEIR CAREERS HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER. WHILE WE CANNOT FULLY ANTICIPATE THE SPECIFIC HEALTHCARE CHALLENGES THAT PREDOCTORAL TRAINEES WILL FACE IN THE COMING DECADES, WE CAN DISCERN EMERGING THEMES THAT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY DOMINATE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT FUTURE HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS WILL INCREASINGLY RELY ON REAL WORLD EVIDENCE EMERGING FROM THE CONVERGENCE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND ROUTINELY COLLECTED BIG DATA. ALSO, IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR FROM THE COVID- 19 PANDEMIC THAT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HUMANS, ANIMALS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE A CRITICAL, PERHAPS EXISTENTIAL DETERMINANT OF OUR HEALTH AND SURVIVAL. FINALLY, WHILE THE WEALTHY APPEAR TO BE REACHING OUR NATURAL LIFESPANS, DURABLE SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITIES ARE ESTIMATED TO ACCOUNT FOR ROUGHLY ONE IN THREE PREMATURE DEATHS EVEN IN HIGHLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES; SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH GAINS UNDOUBTEDLY DEPEND ON ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND OTHER CAUSES OF DISPARITY.

ONECYTE\u2019S SINGLE-CELL PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO CELL BIOLOGY AT AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE; POTENTIALLY ENABLING NEW CLASSES OF THERAPEUTICS, AND ENHANCING BASIC SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDINGS. THE IMPACT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE REDUCING TIME AND COST OF PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS IMPROVING EFFICACY AND SAFETY. THIS CAN ENABLE DEVELOPING NEW DRUGS FOR CURRENTLY UNTREATABLE AND RARE DISEASES, WHICH ARE PRESENTLY NOT FEASIBLE TO DEVELOP OR MANUFACTURE. BEYOND THIS INITIAL APPLICATION, ONECYTE\u2019S TECHNOLOGY COULD BECOME A READILY IMPLEMENTED RESEARCH TOOL, ENHANCING THE BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF BIOLOGY, OR FACILITATING ENGINEERING OF CELL FUNCTION FOR CELL THERAPY APPLICATIONS.  ONECYTE IS SEEKING FUNDING TO EXPAND THE INNOVATIVE SINGLE-CELL ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES AND SCREEN FOR ADDITIONAL CRITICAL PRODUCT QUALITY ATTRIBUTES (PQAS) IMPORTANT FOR DRUG SAFETY AND EFFICACY, AS WELL AS TRANSITION THE SINGLE-CELL TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO A COMMERCIAL PROCESS BY THE END OF SBIR PHASE II.  IN AIM 1. ONECYTE WILL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE SINGLE-CELL ASSAYS FOR ADDITIONAL PQAS, FOCUSING ON SCREENING FOR UNDESIRED DEVIATIONS IN DRUG MANUFACTURABILITY, WHICH LEAD TO REDUCED DRUG CIRCULATING HALF-LIFE AND REDUCED PRODUCTION YIELD.  IN AIM 2. ONECYTE WILL AUTOMATE AND SCALE-UP SINGLE-CELL DATA ANALYTICS TOWARDS IMPROVED PREDICTIVITY FOR DRUG MANUFACTURABILITY, AS WELL AS AUTOMATE THE PIPELINE FOR COMMERCIAL DATA ANALYTICS WITH THE NECESSARY MINIMUM USER INPUT.  IN AIM 3. ONECYTE WILL DEVELOP A MANUFACTURING READY THERMOPLASTIC MICROFLUIDIC CHIP, REPLACING AN ELASTOMERIC MATERIAL.

MANAGEMENT AND, INCREASINGLY, AS A WINDOW TO NEURODEGENERATIVE AND SYSTEMIC DISEASES. OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY (OCT) IS ITS MOST IMPORTANT MODALITY, BUT ALSO ITS MOST PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF INTEROPERABILITY, STORAGE AND UNIFIED ANALYSES. MUCH OF THIS IS TO DO WITH INCOMPATIBLE INSTRUMENTS AND DATA FORMATS. RAPID ADVANCES IN RADIOLOGY RESULTED FROM THE DICOM STANDARDIZATION OF IMAGE DATA, FACILITATING MORE COLLABORATIVE WORK, BETTER DATA INSIGHT, DEVICE INDEPENDENCE AND INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENTS THAT TODAY HAVE SPAWNED MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT VENDORS OFFERING PROCESSING AND ARCHIVAL SOLUTIONS. FOR OCT, NO SUCH SOLUTION EXISTS AND, AS A DIRECT RESULT, DESPITE BEING THE STANDARD OF CARE, THE CLINICAL DATA REMAINS UNDER-UTILIZED AND THE RESEARCH FRAGMENTED. OPEN FORMATS REDUCE OVERALL COSTS AND CAN ULTIMATELY LEAD TO BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES. THIS PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH THE FIRST, COMMERCIAL GRADE, CLOUD-BASED, TRULY VENDOR NEUTRAL, DICOM COMPLIANT, IMAGE AND INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING PLATFORM FOR OPHTHALMIC OCT. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL BRING THE FUNCTIONALITY, INTEROPERABILITY, AND INNOVATION OF RADIOLOGY TO OPHTHALMOLOGY. THE PROJECT HAS THE FOLLOWING CLEAR AND ACHIEVABLE MILESTONES: 1) DEVELOP NEBULA, A CLOUD-BASED, DICOM-COMPLIANT, IMAGE STORAGE AND ARCHIVE PLATFORM. THIS WILL BE BUILT WITH SECURITY AS THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION AND WILL NATIVELY SUPPORT PATIENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. 2) ADD A WEB-BASED ANALYSIS FRONT-END TO NEBULA OPTIMIZED FOR CLINICAL OPHTHALMIC WORKFLOWS. 3) BUILD ON OUR PHASE I AWARD, AND IMPLEMENT, VALIDATE AND RELEASE AI-BASED AMD PROGNOSTICS, OCT-ANGIOGRAPHY ANALYTICS AND RETINAL FLUID QUANTIFICATION SOFTWARE. 4) APPLY FOR REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR BOTH NEBULA\u2019S PICTURE ARCHIVING AND COMMUNICATIONS (PACS) FOR OPHTHALMOLOGY AND THE FLUID QUANTIFICATION MODULE. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR CLINICAL USE OF THE SYSTEM AND SERVE AS A PLATFORM FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF OPHTHALMIC AND NEUROLOGIC RESEARCH. WE HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN THE PROPOSED WORK FROM RESEARCHERS, OPHTHALMOLOGISTS, AND OPTOMETRISTS.

CHRONIC BACTERIAL INFECTION LEADS TO PERSISTENT AND SEVERE NEUTROPHIL-DOMINATED PULMONARY INFLAMMATION, HIGH LUNG PROTEASE LEVELS, LUNG DAMAGE AND A DECLINE IN FEV1. CFTR MODULATOR/CORRECTORS FROM VERTEX SUCH AS TRIKAFTA SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE CF PATIENT LUNG FUNCTION BY >10% BUT DO NOT BRING IT INTO THE NORMAL RANGE AND FOR PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING BACTERIAL LUNG INFECTIONS, DO NOT CLEAR BACTERIA FROM THEIR LUNGS.

SINCE THE DAMAGE ATTR-CM CAUSES TO THE HEART IS PROGRESSIVE, DIAGNOSIS DELAYS STRONGLY IMPACT PROGNOSIS AND INCREASE MORTALITY. DIAGNOSIS IS PROBLEMATIC FOR TWO REASONS: ATTR-CM HAS A VARIABLE PRESENTATION AND THE PREVALENCE IS NOT HIGH. THUS, ATTR-CM IS OFTEN NOT CONSIDERED DURING DIAGNOSIS AND A MORE COMMON DIAGNOSIS WITH SIMILAR SYMPTOMS IS GIVEN ERRONEOUSLY. UP TO 98% OF PATIENTS ARE NOT DIAGNOSED DUE TO THE LOW PREVALENCE AND VARIABLE PRESENTATION.

EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A LYOPHILIZATION PROTOCOL FOR MODEL CELL LINES HAVE BEEN ONGOING FOR DECADES, HOWEVER, LOADING PROTECTIVE AGENTS INTO NUCLEATED CELLS HAS PROVEN CHALLENGING. DESICORP HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL AND INNOVATIVE CELL LOADING DEVICE, TERMED THE HIGH FLOW ACOUSTOFLUIDIC LOADING (HFAL) THAT CAN DELIVER PROTECTIVE OSMOLYTES, PROTEINS, AND NUCLEOTIDES INTO EUKARYOTIC CELLS. UNLIKE MICROFLUIDIC LOADING TECHNIQUES, HFAL USES LARGE CHANNEL DIMENSIONS THAT ALLOW SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER VOLUMES OF CELL SUSPENSION TO FLOW THROUGH IT AT ONCE. THE CELLS ARE MIXED WITH CATIONIC LIPID-COATED MICROBUBBLES THAT RESONATE WITH ULTRASOUND WAVES, INDUCING CAVITATION. THESE CAVITATION-INDUCED MICROJETS PHYSICALLY INJECT COMPOUNDS FROM THE SURROUNDING MEDIA INTO THE CELLS IN SUSPENSION, WHICH THEN REPAIR ANY MEMBRANE DAMAGE AND SEAL MEMBRANE-IMPERMEANT COMPOUNDS INSIDE OF THE CELL.

MASTOCYTOSIS IS A RARE SET OF DISEASES, CHARACTERIZED BY THE INCREASED PRESENCE OF MAST CELLS IN VARIOUS TISSUES AND ORGANS. PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MASTOCYTOSIS OFTEN HAVE DIVERSE TRIGGERS THAT PROMOTE THE ACTIVATION OF MAST CELLS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE ONSET OF DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS, RANGING FROM HIVES AND ABDOMINAL PAIN TO ORGAN DAMAGE AND LIFE-THREATENING ANAPHYLAXIS. ALTHOUGH TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MASTOCYTOSIS PATIENTS EXIST, THEY ARE NON-SPECIFIC AND ARE OFTEN LIMITED TO SYMPTOM ALLEVIATION AND FAIL TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE INCAPACITATING AND LIFE-THREATENING PROGNOSES MASTOCYTOSIS PATIENTS FACE. THEREFORE, BETTER THERAPIES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED AND NEMAGEN\u2019S MISSION IS TO ADDRESS THIS SUBSTANTIAL NEED. OUR CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, IDENTIFIED A UNIQUE MAST CELL PROGENITOR THAT IS DEFINED BY ITS EXPRESSION OF THE ENZYME CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 1 (CAR1). CARBONIC ANHYDRASES ARE A FAMILY OF METABOLIC ENZYMES, KNOWN FOR THEIR IMPORTANT ROLES IN REGULATING PH AND CO2 HOMEOSTASIS. HOWEVER, THEIR ROLE IN MAST CELL DEVELOPMENT WAS UNAPPRECIATED. NEMAGEN\u2019S PEER-REVIEWED AND PUBLISHED FINDINGS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT PHARMACOLOGICALLY OR GENETICALLY TARGETING CAR1 IS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT MURINE AND HUMAN MAST CELL DEVELOPMENT. MOREOVER, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT CAR1 INHIBITION IS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT MAST CELL RESPONSES IN MURINE MODELS OF MASTOCYTOSIS. COLLECTIVELY, OUR EXCITING FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CAR1 REPRESENTS A NEW THERAPEUTIC TARGET TO TREAT MASTOCYTOSIS AND OTHER MAST CELL-MEDIATED DISEASES.

THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ATTR: (1) HEREDITARY ATTR (HATTR), WHERE THE DESTABILIZING MUTATION IN THE TTR-GENE IS INHERITED, OR (2) ATTRWT, IN WHICH PEOPLE WITH THE WILD-TYPE TTR-GENE SEQUENCE DEVELOP THE DISEASE SPORADICALLY. RECENT ESTIMATES PUT THE WORLDWIDE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY ATTR AT APPROXIMATELY 550,000. HOWEVER, THESE PATIENT POPULATIONS ARE THOUGHT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERDIAGNOSED, AS THERE IS A LACK OF RAPID AND READILY AVAILABLE DIAGNOSTICS. NEW DIAGNOSTICS FOR ATTR DISEASE ARE NEEDED AS CONFIRMATION OF ATTR IS SLOW, TAKING UP 5 YEARS. MANY PATIENTS PRESENT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO OTHER CONDITIONS, LEADING TO MISDIAGNOSIS. DUE TO THIS, ATTR IS OFTEN DIAGNOSED BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION OF OTHER DISEASES AND MANY PATIENTS HAVE TO SEE MULTIPLE SPECIALISTS BEFORE GETTING THE CORRECT DIAGNOSIS, CAUSING A DELAY IN TREATMENT AND FURTHER AMYLOID DEPOSITION. GIVEN THAT THE LIFE EXPECTANCY ONCE DIAGNOSED WITH ATTR IS ONLY 2-10 YEARS, A BLOOD-BASED DIAGNOSTIC AND BIOMARKER COULD BE USED TO SHIFT THE CURRENT PARADIGM FROM CONFIRMATION OF LATE-STAGE DEPOSITION TO A CLINICAL LEVEL SCREEN, ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL WITH SUSPECTED RISK TO RECEIVE DISEASE-MODIFYING TREATMENT EARLIER, REDUCING MORTALITY, AND IMPROVING PATIENT QUALITY OF LIFE.

THE PLATFORM RELIES ON A CLICK CHEMISTRY REACTION BETWEEN AN INJECTABLE BIOPOLYMER AND A MODIFIED PROTODRUG WITH ATTENUATED ACTIVITY/TOXICITY. MOST DRUGS ARE ADMINISTERED SYSTEMICALLY AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE BODY. DUE TO LACK OF SPECIFICITY FOR THE PATHOLOGICAL SITE, HIGH DOSES ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC CONCENTRATIONS, CAUSING TOXICITY AND ADES. IN 2013, THERE WERE 1.2 MILLION REPORTS OF ADES IN THE U.S. ALONE, REPRESENTING OVER 5% OF ALL HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. ADES ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE 90% FAILURE RATE OF DRUG CANDIDATES DUE TO THE INABILITY TO ACHIEVE THERAPEUTIC CONCENTRATIONS AT THE TARGET SITE OR INTOLERABLE SIDE EFFECTS, LEADING TO HIGH DRUG DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND PRICES. TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS, THE CAP PLATFORM WAS DEVELOPED TO ACHIEVE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF ACTIVE DRUGS AT SPECIFIC PATHOLOGICAL SITES WHILE MINIMIZING SYSTEMIC TOXICITY. CAP CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS: 1) A TRANS-CYCLOOCTENE (TCO)-MODIFIED PROTODRUG WITH ATTENUATED ACTIVITY/TOXICITY; AND 2) AN INJECTABLE, TETRAZINE (TZ)-MODIFIED SODIUM HYALURONATE (NAHA) BIOPOLYMER. THE BIOPOLYMER IS NOT THERAPEUTICALLY ACTIVE, BUT RATHER FUNCTIONS BY ACTIVATING THE PROTODRUG IN THE BODY IN A 4-STEP PROCESS. THE BIOPOLYMER IS INJECTED LOCALLY AT A PATHOLOGICAL SITE, FOLLOWED BY SYSTEMIC ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROTODRUG. AT THE LOCAL SITE, THE BIOPOLYMER SELECTIVELY AND RAPIDLY CAPTURES THE PROTODRUG VIA A BIOORTHOGONAL \u201cCLICK CHEMISTRY\u201d REACTION AND RELEASES THE ACTIVE DRUG. THROUGH THIS PLATFORM, TAMBO SEEKS TO IMPROVE THE TREATMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING TUMOR-LOCALIZED THERAPY, ANTIBIOTICS FOR SITE-SPECIFIC INFECTIONS, AND LOCALIZED ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THERAPY AND PAIN MANAGEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, THE DOXORUBICIN-BASED PROTODRUG TREATMENT FOR ADVANCED SARCOMA PATIENTS DEVELOPED USING THE CAP TECHNOLOGY IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A PHASE 1 DOSE ESCALATION CLINICAL TRIAL (NCT04106492).

IN EITHER CASE, UNDERSTANDING THE STEM CELL NICHE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO RECAPITULATING OR MANIPULATING CONDITIONS TO ENABLE THERAPY. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HYPOXIA PLAYS A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THE STEM CELL NICHE. LOW OXYGEN (O2) CONDITIONS BENEFIT THE SELF-RENEWAL OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC, HEMATOPOIETIC, MESENCHYMAL, AND NEURAL STEM CELLS, AS WELL AS IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF GENETIC REPROGRAMMING TO INDUCE PLURIPOTENCY. THERE IS EMERGING EVIDENCE THAT HARNESSING OR MANIPULATING THE HYPOXIC RESPONSE CAN RESULT IN SAFER, MORE EFFICACIOUS METHODOLOGIES FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY REPRODUCE DIFFERENT HYPOXIC CONDITIONS IN CELL REPROGRAMMING RESEARCH AN EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW TESTING OF MULTIPLE HYPOXIC CONDITIONS FOR A GIVEN REPROGRAMMING PROTOCOL IS REQUIRED. CO2/O2 INCUBATORS, CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET, ARE TOO EXPENSIVE AND CAN BE SETUP FOR ONLY ONE HYPOXIC CONDITION AT A TIME.

INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE HAVE HAD OR CURRENTLY SUFFER FROM OPIOID USE DISORDER (OUD). OUD AFFLICTS INDIVIDUALS FROM ALL SOCIOECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS WITH DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING A RISING INCIDENCE OF NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME AND THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, I.E., HIV AND HEPATITIS C, ASSOCIATED WITH SYRINGE SHARING. THE MOST RECENT PROVISIONAL DATA FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) INDICATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 81,230 DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE 12 MONTHS LEADING UP TO MAY 2020\u2014THE LARGEST ANNUAL NUMBER OF DRUG OVERDOSES EVER RECORDED. IN 2019, HOSPITALS ESTIMATED AN ANNUAL COST OF OUD OF $787B TO SOCIETY, $93B TO TAXPAYERS, AND $89B TO THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER (E.G., METHADONE, BUPRENORPHINE, OR NALTREXONE) ARE CENTRAL TO THE TREATMENT OF OUD. METHADONE, A PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE OPIOID MEDICATION FOR TREATING OUD, EXTENDS RETENTION IN CARE, REDUCES MORTALITY, AND INHIBITS ILLICIT DRUG USE. HOWEVER, METHADONE TREATMENT IS LIMITED TO FEDERALLY CERTIFIED OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS (OTPS), WHICH MUST MEET COMPLEX REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION. THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE NEW PATIENTS TO TAKE THEIR DOSE IN PERSON SIX DAYS PER WEEK AND LIMIT THE LOCATIONS WHERE PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE METHADONE. FINDING AN OTP CAN BE CHALLENGING, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE IN RURAL AREAS AS ONLY 3% OF OTPS ARE RURALLY LOCATED. THE GREATEST BARRIERS THAT KEEP INDIVIDUALS WITH OUD FROM RECEIVING TREATMENT INCLUDE 1) AVAILABILITY; 2) ACCESSIBILITY (I.E., DAILY VISITS FOR DIRECTLY OBSERVED DOSING); 3) ACCEPTABILITY (I.E., NEED FOR DETOX FOR OTHER NON-METHADONE TREATMENT OPTIONS); AND 4) PRIVACY. TO ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS, ELPIDATEC HAS DEVELOPED ELPIDA, AN OTP-SPECIFIC, MOBILE- AND DESKTOP-FRIENDLY WEB-APPLICATION THAT COMBINES VIDEO, TAMPER-EVIDENT BARCODE LABELS, FACIAL RECOGNITION, AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML) TO ENABLE ACCELERATED TAKE-HOME METHADONE REGIMENS WHILE MAINTAINING SAFETY AND DIVERSION PREVENTION. ELPIDA ENHANCES PATIENT ACCESS TO TREATMENT, ALIGNS WITH OTP WORKFLOW, AND IMPROVES PHYSICIAN ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF OUD PATIENTS, PROVIDING PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE PATIENT INFORMATION VIA REAL-TIME, ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENTS (EMAS). IN THIS PROJECT, ELPIDATEC WILL COMPLETE FEASIBILITY TESTING, ITERATIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKET FIT TESTING OF ELPIDA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ADAPT OREGON, A RURAL OTP, AND OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY. THE PHASE I SBIR APPLICATION HAS THREE AIMS: 1) CONDUCT FEASIBILITY TESTING OF THE MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP) WITH PATIENT- AND CLINICIAN-FACING WEB- APPLICATIONS AND EVALUATE TRACKING PERFORMANCE; 2) DEVELOP AND INTEGRATE KEY ML-ENHANCED FEATURES SUCH AS FACIAL RECOGNITION AND METHADONE VIAL POSITION TRACKING FOR AUTOMATED DOSING EVENT INTERPRETATION; AND 3) ASSESS THE DEMAND AND ACCEPTABILITY OF ELPIDA AMONG PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. INSIGHTS GATHERED IN PHASE I WILL INFORM ACTIONABLE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE DESIGN OF EMA CONSTRUCTS TO BE EXECUTED IN PHASE II.

FSHD IS A PROGRESSIVE DISEASE WHERE PATIENTS INITIALLY LOSE MUSCLE CELLS IN THE FACE, SHOULDERS AND UPPER ARMS BEFORE DEGENERATION EXPANDS TO INCLUDE NEARLY ALL SKELETAL MUSCLES AND 20% BECOME WHEELCHAIR BOUND. 95% OF FSHD PATIENTS DISPLAY A CONTRACTION OF THE HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC D4Z4 REPEAT (FSHD1) CONTAINING AN OPEN READING FRAME FOR THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (TF) DOUBLE HOMEOBOX 4 (DUX4). DUX4 MISEXPRESSION IS ASSOCIATED WITH MYOBLAST TOXICITY AND IS THOUGHT TO BE THE DRIVER OF FSHD. IT IS BELIEVED THAT DUX4 INDUCES MYOBLAST DEATH BY UPREGULATING TARGET GENES INCLUDING MBD3L2, TRIM43, ZSCAN4, AND LEUTX THAT ARE NOT NORMALLY EXPRESSED IN MUSCLE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO FDA APPROVED THERAPIES FOR FSHD, LOSMAPIMOD, A SMALL MOLECULE P38 INHIBITOR, WAS SHOWN TO INHIBIT DUX4 TRANSCRIPTION IN FSHD PATIENT CELLS AND DEMONSTRATED CLINICAL BENEFIT IN SEVERAL OUTCOME MEASURES. HOWEVER, LOSMAPIMOD IS NOT SPECIFIC TO DUX4 AND FSHD, THEREFORE DEVELOPING MULTIPLE TARGETED THERAPIES WITH DIFFERENT MODES OF INHIBITION WOULD INCREASE THE SUCCESS RATE IN TREATING FSHD WITH MINIMUM LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT TARGETING DUX4 WILL BLOCK MULTIPLE PATHWAYS AND REDUCE MUSCLE CELL DEATH. ALTHOUGH TFS LIKE DUX4 ARE ATTRACTIVE THERAPEUTIC TARGETS, THEY ARE CHALLENGING TO TARGET WITH SMALL MOLECULES BECAUSE THEY LACK CLEAR BINDING POCKETS, HAVE LARGE SURFACE AREAS IMPORTANT FOR PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS AND CONTAIN LARGE INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED DOMAINS. AT ALTAY THERAPEUTICS, WE DEVELOPED A PLATFORM THAT ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF SMALL BINDING POCKETS WITHIN INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED DOMAINS IN PREVIOUSLY UNDRUGGABLE TFS, ALLOWING A NOVEL DRUGGABLE APPROACH FOR TARGETING DUX4 AND DEVELOPMENT OF POTENT AND HIGHLY SPECIFIC DUX4 INHIBITORS (DUX4I). WE COMPLETED IN-SILICO SCREENING AND IDENTIFIED INHIBITORS THAT REDUCED DUX4 DNA BINDING BY TARGETING THE DISORDERED LINKER DOMAIN. IMPORTANTLY, THESE DUX4I HAD MINIMAL CYTOTOXICITY, REDUCED DUX4 TARGET GENES AND RESCUED DUX4 DRIVEN CELL VIABILITY, IMPORTANT TO TREAT FSHD. WE PROPOSE THREE AIMS TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE THE MOST PROMISING LEAD AND CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A VIABLE TREATMENT FOR FSHD BASED ON INHIBITING DUX4. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF OUR PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO NOMINATE A LEAD DUX4 DRUG CANDIDATE WITH THE FOLLOWING AIMS, 1) DETERMINE DUX4 TARGET GENE INHIBITION WITH OUR DUX4IS AND MEASURE CYTOTOXICITY IN A BROADER PANEL OF NORMAL CELLS 2) DETERMINE SPECIFICITY OF OUR DUX4IS AGAINST OTHER HOMEOBOX-CONTAINING GENES SUCH AS PAX3/PAX7 AND MEASURE POTENTIAL NON-SPECIFIC INHIBITION OF NORMAL MYOBLAST DIFFERENTIATION 3) MEASURE IN VIVO EFFICACY OF DUX4IS IN MICE IMPLANTED WITH HUMAN FSHD MYOBLASTS IN THE TIBIALIS ANTERIOR MUSCLES (XENOGRAFT MODEL OF FSHD).

CDS DELIVERED VIA AN ORDER SET IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) CAN SIMPLIFY THIS PROCESS AND REDUCE MORTALITY BY BUNDLING THE RECOMMENDED DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC ORDERS TOGETHER.

PROTEIN MANUFACTURING HAS A CURRENT ESTIMATED MARKET SIZE OF OVER $300 BILLION, DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE AREAS OF ANTIBODIES AND BIOLOGIC THERAPEUTICS, BIOTECHNOLOGY, INDUSTRIAL PROTEIN REAGENTS, AND FOOD. HOWEVER, PROTEIN PRODUCTION IS OFTEN A TIME-, COST- AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE PROCESS. SOME PROTEINS ARE DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS IN HIGH YIELDS DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THE CELL TO TRANSLATE THE GENE SEQUENCES EFFICIENTLY. CANDIDATE PROTEINS MAY BE ABANDONED AT THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PHASE DUE TO AN INABILITY TO PRODUCE THEM IN SUFFICIENT YIELDS FOR COST-EFFECTIVE COMMERCIAL-SCALE PRODUCTION. TRADITIONAL CODON OPTIMIZATION, A WIDELY USED STRATEGY, CAN RESULT IN ONLY MODEST YIELD IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE IT IS GROUNDED IN INCOMPLETE AND INCORRECT MODELS OF PROTEIN TRANSLATION THAT ASSUME A STATIC POOL OF TRNAS WITHIN A GIVEN ORGANISM. CODOMAX HAS DISCOVERED THAT CELLS REGULATE TRANSLATION IN RESPONSE TO STRESS BY ALTERING THE TRNA POOL TO MATCH THE CODONS ENRICHED IN STRESS RESPONSE MRNAS, WHICH IN TURN ENHANCES TRANSLATION OF THE CODON-BIASED MRNAS. CODOMAX\u2019S PLATFORM LEVERAGES THIS MECHANISM BY USING SYSTEMS-LEVEL APPROACHES TO MEASURE THE CODONS THAT ARE MOST FREQUENTLY TRANSLATED DURING THE PRODUCTION OF A RECOMBINANT PROTEIN, ACCOUNTING FOR A SPECIFIC CELL TYPE UNDER SPECIFIC GROWTH CONDITIONS AND USING THIS INFORMATION TO CHOOSE THE TRULY OPTIMAL CODONS. THIS SOLUTION INCREASES RECOMBINANT PROTEIN PRODUCTION IN CELLS AND ENHANCES THE TRANSLATION OF MRNA THERAPEUTICS, HELPING TO MEET CURRENT PROTEIN MANUFACTURING DEMANDS. PILOT STUDIES OF THIS APPROACH IN PICHIA PASTORIS, ONE OF THE THREE MAJOR CELL LINES USED IN PROTEIN MANUFACTURING, RESULTED IN A 2.4-FOLD INCREASE IN PROTEIN PRODUCTION COMPARED TO GENES ALREADY OPTIMIZED BY EXISTING COMMERCIAL ALGORITHMS. IN THIS PHASE I PROJECT, CODOMAX WILL BUILD ON THESE FINDINGS BY UNDERTAKING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) OPTIMIZING CODONS FOR INTERFERON PRODUCTION IN P. PASTORIS AND DEMONSTRATING AN INCREASE IN PROTEIN YIELD OF AT LEAST 200% AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO RETAIN 90% FUNCTIONALITY IN IFN-A-2B AND IFN, AND (2) ESTABLISHING THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PLATFORM TO ENABLE COMPLEX PROTEIN PRODUCTION USING N-GLYCOSYLATED IFN-BETA-1A AND HUMAN SERUM ALBUMIN AS CASE STUDIES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL BOTH DEMONSTRATE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT OF OUR PLATFORM TO PRODUCE COMMERCIALLY RELEVANT THERAPEUTIC PROTEINS IN HIGHER YIELDS THAN EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES AND DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING P. PASTORIS FOR MANUFACTURING COMPLEX BIOLOGICS.

IVIG IS RECOMMENDED TO BE GIVEN WITHIN 10 DAYS OF ILLNESS; HOWEVER ONLY 4.7% RECEIVE THE CORRECT DIAGNOSIS AT THE FIRST MEDICAL VISIT. TIMELY AND ACCURATELY DIAGNOSIS OF KD IS CRITICAL, YET THERE ISN\u2019T A GOLD STANDARD DIAGNOSTIC TEST. A CHALLENGE OF DIAGNOSIS IS THAT THE CLINICAL SIGNS OF KD OVERLAP THOSE OF OTHER PEDIATRIC FEBRILE ILLNESSES. WE PREVIOUSLY APPLIED STATISTICAL LEARNING USING CLINICAL AND LABORATORY TEST VARIABLES TO DIFFERENTIATE KD FROM FEBRILE ILLNESSES AND VALIDATED THE ALGORITHM IN FIVE CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITALS IN THE US. RESULTS SHOWED ITS POTENTIAL OF BEING A COMPUTER-ASSIST TOOL OF DECISION MAKING AT POINT OF CARE IN THE SETTINGS WHERE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY WOULD NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE.

AAV VECTOR MEDIATED GENE THERAPY HAS SHOWN TO BE A POTENTIALLY HUGE MARKET. ALTHOUGH SUCCESSFUL IN CLINICAL STUDIES FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS FOR EFFECTIVE AAV BRAIN APPLICATION IS HIGH PREVALENCE OF NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY (NAB) IN HUMANS. IN THE GENERAL HUMAN POPULATION, OVER 95 % OF INDIVIDUALS ARE INFECTED BY AAV AND, ON AVERAGE, 50 % OF THEM DEVELOP NABS. THE INHIBITION EFFECT OF NABS ON AAV BRAIN TRANSDUCTION HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED REGARDLESS OF DELIVERY ROUTES (DIRECT INTRA-BRAIN INJECTION OR SYSTEMIC ADMINISTRATION). SEVERAL APPROACHES HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED TO ESCAPE AAV NABS, INCLUDING CHEMICAL MODIFICATION, USE OF DIFFERENT AAV VECTOR SEROTYPES, AAV CAPSID ENGINEERING, AND BIOLOGICAL DEPLETION OF NAB TITER (EMPTY CAPSID UTILIZATION, B CELL DEPLETION, PLASMA-APHERESIS, AND IG PROTEASES). GENERALLY, THESE APPROACHES HAVE LOW EFFICIENCY, UNWANTED SIDE EFFECTS, OR AAV TROPISM CHANGE. RECENTLY, NABGEN HAS DEVELOPED A VECTOR INDEPENDENT PROTEIN-BASED STRATEGY TO UNIVERSALLY BLOCK NABS USING A UNIQUE MYCOPLASMA DERIVED PROTEIN, TERMED PROTEIN-M. PROTEIN-M IS ABLE TO INTERACT WITH IMMUNOGLOBULIN FROM ANY SPECIES WITHOUT ANTIGEN DEPENDENCE BY BINDING TO VARIABLE REGIONS ON THE ANTIBODY LIGHT AND HEAVY CHAINS. USING HUMAN IVIG AND SERUM FROM AAV IMMUNIZED MICE, WE HAVE FOUND THAT PROTEIN-M REDUCED AAV VECTOR NEUTRALIZATION OVER 100 FOLD WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP WITHOUT PROTEIN-M IN VITRO. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT PROTEIN-M WAS ABLE TO RETAIN AAV TRANSDUCTION OVER 1000 FOLD IN MICE WITH ADOPTIVE TRANSFER OF NAB POSITIVE SERUM. SO FAR, THIS IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO EVADE AAV NABS. TO EXPLORE THE APPLICATION OF PROTEIN-M IN PATIENTS WITH AAV BRAIN TARGETED THERAPY, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS THE EFFICACY OF PROTEIN-M TO PROTECT AAV FROM NABS FOR BRAIN TRANSDUCTION IN SUBJECTS WITH NABS. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL FIRST STUDY THE EFFECT OF PROTEIN- M CO-ADMINISTERED WITH AAV VECTORS ON AAV NAB BLOCKAGE VIA DIRECT INJECTION INTO THE BRAIN IN MICE WITH PRE- IMMUNIZATION OF AAV (AIM 1). NEXT, WE WILL STUDY THE EFFECT OF PROTEIN-M VIA SYSTEMIC INJECTION ON BRAIN TRANSDUCTION AFTER DIRECT DELIVERY OF AAV VECTORS (AIM 2).

GAMMA IRRADIATION DESTROYS NUCLEIC ACIDS TO INACTIVATE PATHOGENS OR RENDER ANY CELLS REPLICATION INCOMPETENT BUT LEAVES STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS LIKE PROTEINS INTACT. THE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES OF RELIANCE ON GAMMA IRRADIATION FOR TERMINAL STERILIZATION ARE, HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT. GAMMA IRRADIATION REQUIRES HIGH DOSES OF RADIATION, NECESSITATING SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND SPECIALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE, DRIVING UP COSTS AND PROCESSING TIMES TO MANUFACTURE A FINISHED DRUG. AS SUCH, FEW BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE ABLE TO ADOPT GAMMA-IRRADIATION PROCESSES IN-HOUSE TO EXPEDITE MANUFACTURING TIMELINES, AND THEY REMAIN RELIANT ON CENTRALIZED SHIELDED FACILITIES. LOW ENERGY ELECTRON IRRADIATION (LEEI) REPRESENTS A PRACTICAL AND INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO GAMMA IRRADIATION; HOWEVER, A LOW PENETRATION DEPTH LIMITS ITS UTILITY FOR LIQUID SUSPENSIONS. TO OVERCOME THESE OBSTACLES, HEAT BIOLOGICS HAS PARTNERED WITH GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY TO DEVELOP A MICROFLUIDICS-ENABLED IN-LINE CONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT LEEI STERILIZATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS.

THEREFORE, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR THERAPEUTIC TRANSPORTERS THAT CAN BE INJECTED INTRAVENOUSLY (I.V.), AND EFFECTIVELY TRAVERSE THE BBB AND DELIVER THERAPEUTIC AGENTS TO THE BRAIN [1-8]. CYTONUS THERAPEUTICS HAS PIONEERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW BIOINSPIRED DELIVERY AGENT (CARGOCYTESTM) WITH POTENTIAL TO MEET THIS CRITICAL NEED.

A HALLMARK OF CLE IS THE PRESENCE OF AUTOANTIBODIES AGAINST NUCLEIC ACIDS AND NUCLEIC ACID-BINDING PROTEINS, AS WELL AS ELEVATED INTERFERONS (IFNS). IN CLE IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHICH MECHANISMS ARE MOST CRITICAL IN PRECIPITATING DISEASE; HOWEVER, CLE LESIONS HISTOLOGICALLY PRESENT AS AN INTERFACE DERMATITIS, WHICH IS ORCHESTRATED BY TYPE-I AND TYPE III INTERFERONS AND INTERFERON-REGULATED CHEMOKINES LARGELY PRODUCED BY BASAL KERATINOCYTES IN THE LOWER EPIDERMIS. IMPORTANTLY, A BREAK-THROUGH DISCOVERY IN OUR LABORATORIES HAS IDENTIFIED A NOVEL KINASE TARGET FOR THE INHIBITION OF TYPE-I AND TYPE-III IFN PRODUCTION CALLED RIOK3. RIOK3 IS A MEMBER OF THE RIO PROTEIN KINASE FAMILY (RIGHT OPEN READING FRAME KINASE) AND PRELIMINARY DATA FROM CRISPR KNOCKOUT AND SIRNA KNOCKDOWNS IN MAMMALIAN CELLS DEMONSTRATES ITS PROMINENT ROLE IN IFN PRODUCTION. FOLLOWING KNOCKOUT STUDIES, WE TESTED TWO COMPOUNDS THAT ARE ABLE TO BIND RIOK3. THEY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED TYPE I AND III IFN MRNA AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION FOLLOWING KERATINOCYTE EXPOSURE TO POLYRIBOINOSINIC- POLYRIBOCYTIDYLIC ACID (POLYI:C OR PIC), A TLR3 LIGAND THAT ACTIVATES INTERFERON PATHWAYS. ADDITIONALLY, MEDIA TRANSFER EXPERIMENTS IN KERATINOCYTES CONFIRM THAT RIOK3 INHIBITION NOT ONLY REDUCES THE IFN RESPONSE IN PIC EXPOSED CELLS BUT ALSO DISRUPTS THE IFN FEED-FORWARD LOOP, AS MEASURED BY IFN-REGULATED PROTEIN CXCL10, A KEY DRIVER OF IMMUNE CELL HYPER-RECRUITMENT TO THE SKIN IN CLE LESIONS. THIS PRELIMINARY WORK STRONGLY SUPPORTS OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT A TOPICAL RIOK3 INHIBITOR WILL DOSE-DEPENDENTLY DECREASE CUTANEOUS IFNS AND IFN- REGULATED GENES, RESULTING IN THE REDUCTION OF CLE LESIONS, WITH IMPROVED EFFICACY AND PATIENT TOLERANCE COMPARED TO SYSTEMIC TREATMENTS. IMPORTANTLY, UNLIKE JAK INHIBITORS THAT HAVE AN ON/OFF EFFECT ON MANY CELLULAR PATHWAYS, A TOPICAL RIOK3 INHIBITOR COULD WORK SELECTIVELY AND DOSE-DEPENDENTLY TO FINELY REGULATE IFN SECRETION AND RESTORE IFN BALANCE IN THE SKIN. THEREFORE, RIOK3 INHIBITORS HOLD IMMENSE POTENTIAL AS A NOVEL CLASS OF NEXT GENERATION KINASE INHIBITORS.

THIS OPENS THE DOOR FOR FETAL MOLECULAR THERAPIES TO ADDRESS CRITICAL GENETIC CONDITIONS IN UTERO, PREVENTING PRETERM PREGNANCY TERMINATION, NEWBORN DEATH, OR IRREVERSIBLE TISSUE DAMAGE RESULTING IN LIFE-LONG DISABILITIES. THE DISCOVERY OF CRISPR SYSTEMS AND THEIR REMARKABLE ABILITY TO PERFORM PRECISION GENE EDITING QUICKLY SHOWED POSSIBILITIES FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS TO TREAT GENETIC DISORDERS. HOWEVER, CLINICAL APPLICATION OF CRISPR IS LIMITED DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF MUTATIONS AND DNA RESTRUCTURING AT UNINTENDED OFF-TARGET SITES WITHIN THE GENOME, WHICH CAN LEAD TO TOXICITY AND CANCER. NOWHERE IS THIS DEFICIENCY MORE ACUTE THAN IN THE APPLICATION OF CRISPR FOR IN UTERO GENE EDITING, WHERE UNCONTROLLED EDITING SIDE EFFECTS COULD AFFECT THE PATIENT FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THEIR LIVES. CONTROLLING CRISPR GENE EDITING IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF IN UTERO GENE THERAPIES.

THEREFORE, ALTERNATIVE DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES ARE REQUIRED TO FULLY UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL OF SIRNA AND OTHER NUCLEOTIDES, E.G. MRNA, AS EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTICS. TO ADDRESS THESE UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, WE DEVELOPED A NEW PEPTIDE (P5RHH)-BASED NUCLEOTIDE DELIVERY PLATFORM, WHICH CAN DELIVER NUCLEOTIDES (E.G.

WHILE THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES TO DEVELOPING BETTER GBM TREATMENTS, ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES IS THE IMMUNE-SUPPRESSIVE ENVIRONMENT COMMONLY FOUND WITHIN GBM TUMORS. THIS IMMUNE-SUPPRESSIVE NATURE RESULTS IN A TUMOR THAT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR MOUNTING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE TO GBM CELLS, RENDERING EMERGING IMMUNOTHERAPIES INEFFECTIVE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, SUITABLE MODELS THAT CAN INTERROGATE THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GBM CANCER CELLS AND MICROGLIA AND PERIPHERALLY DERIVED MACROPHAGES WOULD BE INVALUABLE FOR TARGET IDENTIFICATION, SCREENING OF NOVEL THERAPEUTICS AND FOR MODE OF ACTION STUDIES. TUMOR-ASSOCIATED MICROGLIA AND MACROPHAGES ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST DUE TO THEIR PRIMARY ROLE IN SHAPING THE IMMUNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT OF GBM TUMORS.

THESE BIOMARKERS WERE ALSO SHOWN TO BE DOSE- RESPONSIVE TO VAMOROLONE, A NOVEL DISSOCIATIVE STEROIDAL DRUG UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN DMD, WITHIN 2-WEEKS OF TREATMENT, AND AIDED IN DOSE-SELECTION FOR THE RECENTLY COMPLETED CONFIRMATORY, PIVOTAL TRIAL (VBP15-004) IN 121 DMD BOYS. THE PROPOSED AIMS ARE TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH DRUG-RELATED REDUCTIONS IN MDC AND/OR CD23 AT 3 MONTHS TREATMENT ANTICIPATE CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT OF MOTOR OUTCOMES AT 6 MONTHS AND 12 MONTHS TREATMENT. THE DOUBLE-BLIND VBP15-004 TRIAL RANDOMIZED DMD BOYS INTO 4 ARMS (PLACEBO, VAMOROLONE 2.0 MG/KG/DAY, VAMOROLONE 6.0 MG/KG/DAY, PREDNISONE 0.75 MG/KG/DAY), AND INCLUDED A CROSS-OVER OF PLACEBO AND PREDNISONE TO VAMOROLONE AT STUDY MIDPOINT. THE VBP15-004 DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY OF BOTH 2.0 AND 6.0 MG/KG/DAY VAMOROLONE GROUPS VS. PLACEBO (MET PRIMARY AND 4 SEQUENTIAL SECONDARY OUTCOMES) AND SHOWED IMPROVED SAFETY VS. PREDNISONE (NO STUNTING OF GROWTH, NO DELETERIOUS CHANGES IN BONE BIOMARKERS). THE ANTICIPATED RESULT IS THAT MDC AND/OR CD23 PREDICT LATER MOTOR OUTCOMES AND CAN THEN BE ROUTINELY INTEGRATED INTO DMD CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNS TO MONITOR SYSTEMIC AND/OR MUSCLE INFLAMMATORY STATE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "64da52fb-3a18-c546-2eb4-94323160133c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21TR004895_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160084679, "Award ID": "R21TR004422", "Award Amount": 206665.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-05", "CFDA Number": "93.350", "Description": "SYNERGISTIC CLINICAL OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS FOR CERVICAL DYSTONIA - THE DYSTONIAS OVERALL ARE A RARE NEUROLOGIC DISORDER. CERVICAL DYSTONIA (CD), SOMETIMES CALLED \u201cSPASMODIC TORTICOLLIS\u201d, IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF DYSTONIA. CD IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE PARTIAL LOSS OF VOLUNTARY CONTROL OF THE NECK MUSCULATURE PRODUCING ABNORMAL POSTURES AND/OR MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD IN THE FORM OF HEAD TREMOR. IN ADDITION TO THESE OVERT MOTOR ABNORMALITIES, THE DISORDER IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMS INCLUDING PAIN, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR CD ARE SUBOPTIMAL. MANY ORAL MEDICATIONS HAVE BEEN TRIED BUT THEIR EFFICACY IS MINIMAL AND LIMITED BY DOSE-DEPENDENT ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. BOTULINUM NEUROTOXIN (BONT) INJECTIONS REPEATED EVERY 3-4 MONTHS ARE THE PRIMARY TREATMENT OF CHOICE. ALTHOUGH BONT IS HIGHLY EFFICACIOUS FOR MANY PATIENTS, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS ABOUT 1/3 OF PATIENTS DISCONTINUE BONT TREATMENT, AND OF THOSE WHO CONTINUE TREATMENT ABOUT 1/3 ARE UNSATISFIED WITH THE RESPONSE.  BECAUSE TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE SUBOPTIMAL, THERE IS AN ACTIVE EFFORT TO FIND BETTER STRATEGIES FOR TREATING CD, AS EVIDENCED BY DOZENS OF ACTIVE TRIALS LISTED ON CLINICALTRIALS.GOV. HOWEVER, THE MOST COMMON CLINICAL OUTCOME ASSESSMENT USED TO MEASURE MOTOR ABNORMALITIES \u2013 THE TORONTO WESTERN SPASMODIC TORTICOLLIS RATING SCALE (TWSTRS) \u2013 DOES NOT CAPTURE HEAD TREMOR. ALSO, AS WITH MOST CLINICAL RATING SCALES, THE TWSTRS IS AN INTRINSICALLY SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND THEREFORE SUFFERS FROM INTER-RATER VARIABILITY. THIS REDUCES OUR POWER TO DETECT TREATMENT EFFECTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS.  TECHNOLOGY-BASED OBJECTIVE MEASURES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CIRCUMVENT THIS VARIABILITY. ADVANCES IN COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY HAVE ENABLED THE MEASUREMENT OF HEAD ORIENTATION/ROTATION FROM 2-D IMAGES OF THE FACE IN CONVENTIONAL VIDEO RECORDINGS. ONE OF THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES OF OUR GROUP IS TO LEVERAGE THESE ADVANCES TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT CAN CAPTURE AND QUANTIFY MOTOR ABNORMALITIES ACROSS MULTIPLE TYPES OF FOCAL DYSTONIA. WE ARE CALLING THIS SYSTEM THE COMPUTATIONAL MOTOR OBJECTIVE RATER (CMOR). IN THIS PROJECT SPECIFICALLY TARGETING CD, OUR AIMS ARE 1) TO EVALUATE CMOR\u2019S CONVERGENT VALIDITY WITH PATIENT REPORTS OF SEVERITY OF ABNORMAL HEAD POSTURE AND HEAD TREMOR AND 2) TO DETERMINE CMOR\u2019S SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN SEVERITY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERVENTIONS. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS, WE WILL CONDUCT CMOR ANALYSES OF MOTOR SYMPTOMS FROM VIDEO RECORDINGS OF 100 CD PATIENTS ENROLLED IN A SEPARATE DYSTONIA COALITION PROJECT TO EVALUATE THE VARIABILITY OF EFFICACY OF BONT. THAT PROJECT WILL ALSO ACQUIRE PATIENT REPORTS IN THE FORM OF A PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOME WITH SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TWO MOTOR FEATURES OF CD AND THE PATIENT\u2019S GLOBAL IMPRESSION OF CHANGE (PGIC) IN RESPONSE TO EACH BONT TREATMENT.

HOWEVER, ALL THESE TRIALS FOCUS ON THE POST-SYMPTOMATIC PHASE \u2013 AFTER SEIZURE SYMPTOMS HAVE OCCURRED. OUR RECENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTED THAT PRE-SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT \u2013 TREATING PATIENTS BEFORE SEIZURE SYMPTOMS OCCUR, IDEALLY BEFORE 2 YEARS OF AGE \u2013 MAY DELAY OR AVOID SEIZURE SYMPTOMS. THIS IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THOSE WITHOUT SEIZURE SYMPTOMS BY 2 YEARS OF AGE (10-25% OF SWS PATIENTS) OFTEN ENJOY GOOD NEUROCOGNITIVE OUTCOMES BY SCHOOL AGE. MOTIVATED BY THIS, MULTIDISCIPLINARY EXPERTS GATHERED AND REACHED A CONSENSUS IN 2018, 2019, AND 2021, CALLING FOR IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATIONS OF PRE-SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENTS.

AFFECTED CHILDREN EXHIBIT STEROID-RESISTANT NEPHROTIC SYNDROME WITH RAPID PROGRESSION TO END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY, NEUROLOGICAL DEFECTS AND LYMPHOPENIA. A RANGE OF SEVERITY HAS BEEN OBSERVED, WITH THE MOST SEVERELY AFFECTED PATIENTS DYING IN UTERO, WHILE OTHERS LIVE TO ADULTHOOD, ALBEIT REQUIRING DIALYSIS OR KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION. IMPORTANTLY, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC CURE FOR SPLIS, AND THUS THERE IS A DIRE NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS. SGPL1 ENCODES SPHINGOSINE PHOSPHATE LYASE (SPL), AN ESSENTIAL INTRACELLULAR ENZYME RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IRREVERSIBLE BREAKDOWN OF SPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATE (S1P) IN THE FINAL STEP OF SPHINGOLIPID METABOLISM. S1P IS A BIOACTIVE LIPID THAT SIGNALS THROUGH ITS FIVE G PROTEIN COUPLED S1P RECEPTORS TO REGULATE LYMPHOCYTE TRAFFICKING AND OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES. SGPL1 MUTATIONS IMPAIR SPL ACTIVITY AND CAUSE SPHINGOLIPID ACCUMULATION LEADING TO ORGAN DYSFUNCTION AND FAILURE. IN ADDITION, ABERRANT S1P SIGNALING IN SPLIS CHILDREN LEADS TO LYMPHOPENIA DUE TO A DEFECT IN LYMPHOCYTE EGRESS. SPL ACTIVITY DEPENDS ON VITAMIN B6 AS A COFACTOR. INDEPENDENT OF ITS ROLE AS A COENZYME IN OVER 160 ENZYMATIC REACTIONS, VITAMIN B6 CAN ALSO FUNCTION AS A CHAPERONE, STABILIZING VITAMIN B6-DEPENDENT ENZYMES. PHARMACOLOGICAL DOSES OF VITAMIN B6 IN THE FORM OF THE B6 VITAMER PYRIDOXINE HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM INVOLVING B6-DEPENDENT ENZYMES.

DESPITE CURRENT THERAPIES, ~50% OF NEPHROTIC PATIENTS PROGRESS TO END STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE (ESKD) OVER A DECADE. AS A RESULT, THERE IS MUCH INTEREST IN DEVELOPING NEW TREATMENTS. FSGS IS DEFINED BY ITS CHARACTERISTIC HISTOLOGIC PATTERN, BUT THE DISEASE IS CAUSED BY MULTIPLE, DISTINCT ETIOLOGIES, WHICH SHARE A FINAL COMMON PATHWAY OF PODOCYTE INJURY AND DEPLETION. BECAUSE PODOCYTES ARE TERMINALLY DIFFERENTIATED, POSTMITOTIC CELLS, PODOCYTES THAT ARE LOST CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY REPLACED, CAUSING INSTABILITY AND COLLAPSE OF THE GLOMERULAR TUFT, AND DISEASE PROGRESSION. TREATMENT IS FOCUSED ON PREVENTING PODOCYTE INJURY AND LOSS. ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT CGMP SIGNALING IS PODOCYTE PROTECTIVE IN GLOMERULAR DISEASES. NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES (NPS) POTENTLY STIMULATE CGMP GENERATION IN PODOCYTES BY BINDING TO NP RECEPTORS (NPRS). NPRA BINDS ATRIAL NP (ANP) AND BRAIN NP (BNP), AND NPRB BINDS THE C-TYPE NP (CNP). PODOCYTE SPECIFIC KNOCKOUT (KO) OF THE CGMP GENERATING ANP/BNP RECEPTOR, NPRA, AUGMENTS GLOMERULAR INJURY IN PROTEINURIC MOUSE MODELS, INDICATING THAT NPS HAVE PODOCYTE PROTECTIVE ACTIONS. A NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF NP ACTIONS IS THE CLEARANCE RECEPTOR NPRC, WHICH BINDS AND DEGRADES ANP, BNP AND CNP. OUR PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS FOUND: 1. PODOCYTES EXPRESS NPRA, NPRB AND NPRC. 2. NPS PROTECT PODOCYTES FROM APOPTOTIC STIMULI, 3. NPRC IS HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN PODOCYTES AND LIMITS CGMP GENERATION BY LOCALLY AVAILABLE NPS, 4. PHARMACOLOGIC BLOCKADE OF NPRC POTENTIATES NPRA- AND NPRB-INDUCED CGMP GENERATION IN CULTURED PODOCYTES AND IN VIVO, AND 5. PODOCYTE SPECIFIC KO OF NPRC REDUCES ALBUMINURIA IN A MOUSE MODEL OF FSGS. THE DECREASE IN ALBUMINURIA IN PODOCYTE SPECIFIC NPRC KO MICE IS UNLIKELY TO BE MEDIATED BY SYSTEMIC OR HEMODYNAMIC MECHANISMS, AND SUGGESTS A DIRECT PODOCYTE PROTECTIVE EFFECT. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT BLOCKING CLEARANCE OF NPS BY NPRC WILL ELEVATE NP LEVELS AND PROMOTE PODOCYTE PROTECTIVE CGMP SIGNALING.

APPROXIMATELY 1400 CASES OF PCNSL ARE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES ANNUALLY, CLASSICALLY OCCURRING BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45 AND 65, BUT THE INCIDENCE IS RISING IN OLDER PATIENTS WHO REPRESENT A POPULATION IN NEED OF EFFECTIVE THERAPIES WITH LIMITED ADVERSE EFFECT PROFILES[1, 2]. STANDARD FRONTLINE THERAPY CONSISTS OF HIGH-DOSE METHOTREXATE (HD-MTX) WITH AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL TRANSPLANT AS CONSOLIDATION THERAPY. HOWEVER, THESE REGIMENS ARE NOT TOLERATED BY ALL PATIENTS DUE TO SIGNIFICANT NEUROTOXICITY[3]. EVEN THEN, ABOUT A THIRD OF PATIENTS ARE REFRACTORY TO FIRST-LINE TREATMENT, AND UP TO 60% OF THE PATIENTS WILL EVENTUALLY RELAPSE[4]. PROGNOSIS FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE REFRACTORY TO OR RELAPSE AFTER INITIAL THERAPY IS POOR, WITH MEDIAN SURVIVAL OF ONLY ABOUT 1-YEAR FAILURE OF UPFRONT THERAPY[5]. DUE TO POOR LONG TERM OUTCOMES, THERE IS A DESPERATE NEED FOR IMPROVED DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES. A CONSIDERABLE HURDLE IN CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES IS THE LACK OF AVAILABLE BIOMARKERS THAT CAN BE USED RELIABLY TO DIAGNOSE AND MONITOR DISEASE. AS SUCH, THE DIAGNOSIS OF PCNSL FREQUENTLY REQUIRES NEUROSURGICAL BIOPSIES THAT ARE INVASIVE AND ASSOCIATED WITH RISK OF INFECTION, BLEEDING AND NEUROLOGICAL INJURY. MANY PATIENTS INITIALLY UNDERGO A LUMBAR PUNCTURE (LP) FOR CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) THAT IS ANALYZED BY CYTOLOGY AND FLOW CYTOMETRY. THESE APPROACHES, HOWEVER, LACK SENSITIVITY, REQUIRE LARGE QUANTITIES (> 10 ML) OF CSF, AND ARE NON-DIAGNOSTIC IN MANY CASES.

MOST OBSERVATION DATA, HOWEVER, IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH INTER-RATER RELIABILITY, WHICH MAKES THEM LESS ROBUST COMPARED WITH OBJECTIVE MEASURABLE DATA SUCH AS BLOOD TEST VALUES. THIS UNRELIABILITY IS DUE IN PART TO USING LIMITED, UNREPRESENTATIVE SUBJECT SAMPLES DURING THEIR CREATION AND VALIDATION. TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, THE RECOMMENDED APPROACH IS TO USE LARGE DATA SETS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES. THIS HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF DATA REGISTRIES AND BIOREPOSITORIES.

THESE LIMITATIONS OF SIROLIMUS TREATMENT HIGHLIGHT THE CRITICAL NEED TO EXPLORE NOVEL THERAPIES IN LAM. HORMONAL INFLUENCES, ESPECIALLY ESTROGEN, ARE BELIEVED TO PLAY A PATHOGENIC ROLE IN LAM AS SUGGESTED BY THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS: SYMPTOMATIC LAM IS RESTRICTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO FEMALES, LAM IS EXACERBATED BY EXOGENOUS ESTROGEN USE AND PREGNANCY, AND LUNG FUNCTION IN PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH LAM DECLINES FASTER THAN THAT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN.

FOR EXAMPLE, SLEEP HEALTHY USING THE INTERNET (SHUTI) DEVELOPED BY CO-I RITTERBAND IS AN NCI-DESIGNATED RESEARCH-TESTED INTERVENTION THAT DELIVERS COGNITIVE- BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA. A KEY TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH QUESTION REMAINS ABOUT EXISTING EVIDENCE-BASED DIGITAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS LIKE SHUTI, NAMELY, WHAT LEVEL OF TAILORING WOULD BE NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT ACHIEVE OPTIMAL ENGAGEMENT WITH AND EFFICACY OF THESE INTERVENTIONS FOR CAREGIVERS? TO ADDRESS THIS RESEARCH QUESTION, WE WILL RECRUIT 100 HIGH-INTENSITY CAREGIVERS WITH INSOMNIA TO COMPLETE A BASELINE ASSESSMENT OF INSOMNIA AND CAREGIVING CONTEXT. CAREGIVERS WILL THEN RECEIVE ACCESS TO SHUTI IN AN OPEN-LABEL TRIAL, THEN COMPLETE POST- ASSESSMENT AND BE CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO THEIR LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THE 6 INTERVENTION \u201cCORES\u201d: NON- USERS (I.E., COMPLETED NO CORES), INCOMPLETE USERS (I.E., 1 TO 3 CORES), AND COMPLETE USERS (I.E., 4 TO 6 CORES). FOR AIM 1, WE WILL TEST THE ASSOCIATION OF SHUTI ENGAGEMENT WITH CAREGIVING CONTEXT. FIRST, WE WILL TEST WHETHER CAREGIVERS' ENGAGEMENT WITH SHUTI (I.E., BEING A NON-USER VS. INCOMPLETE USER VS. COMPLETE USER) IS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR USER CHARACTERISTICS (I.E., CAREGIVING STRAIN, SELF-EFFICACY, AND GUILT) AND ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERISTICS (I.E., PROXIMITY TO CARE RECIPIENT; CARE RECIPIENT FUNCTIONAL, COGNITIVE, AND BEHAVIORAL STATUS; CAREGIVING TASKS; AIM 1A). SECOND, WE WILL DESCRIBE CAREGIVERS' BARRIERS TO AND MOTIVATIONS FOR SHUTI ENGAGEMENT FROM THEIR RESPONSES TO OPEN-ENDED SURVEYS, AND HOW CAREGIVER-SPECIFIC TAILORING MAY IMPROVE UPTAKE AND USAGE (AIM 1B). THEMATIC CODING WILL ALSO EXAMINE HOW CAREGIVERS' RECOMMENDATIONS GENERALIZE TO OTHER EVIDENCE-BASED DIGITAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, AND FINDINGS WILL BE VALIDATED USING SYNTHESIZED MEMBER CHECKING. FOR AIM 2, WE WILL TEST WHETHER THE EFFECTS OF SHUTI ON KNOWN COGNITIVE MECHANISMS OF CHANGE TARGETED BY SHUTI (I.E., MORE ADAPTIVE SLEEP BELIEFS, INTERNALIZED SLEEP LOCUS OF CONTROL) ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN CAREGIVING-RELATED USER AND ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERISTICS.

ALTHOUGH PROMISING TREATMENTS FOR CMT1A ARE ON THE HORIZON, THE EVALUATION OF THERAPIES IN HUMAN TRAILS IS HINDERED BY A LACK OF RESPONSIVE BIOMARKERS, WHICH IS CRITICAL DUE TO THE SLOWLY PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF CMT1A. THE CMT NEUROPATHY SCORE (CMTNS) IS A COMPOSITE DISABILITY SCORE PROPOSED AS A BIOMARKER OF CMT; HOWEVER, THE LIMITED RESPONSIVENESS OF THE CMTNS ANNUALLY DEMANDS A FORMIDABLY LARGE SAMPLE SIZE FOR USE IN CMT CLINICAL STUDIES. MORE RECENTLY, IN- TRAMUSCULAR FAT PERCENTAGE (VIA FAT-WATER MRI) HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A MORE SENSITIVE BIOMARKER. UNFORTUNATE- LY, FAT REPLACEMENT REPRESENTS THE CHRONIC ENDPOINT OF CMT1A; THEREFORE, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THERA- PIES THAT SLOW OR HALT (RATHER THAN REVERSE) PROGRESSION IN MUSCLES THAT ARE ALREADY DENERVATED USING THIS MEASURE. BASED ON OUR DEVELOPED NERVE MRI METHODS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DIRECTLY IMAGING THE PATHOLOGY OF INTEREST WITHIN NERVES THEMSELVES MAY OFFER COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO MONITOR DISEASE PROGRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH CMT1A. PUBLISHED RESULTS FROM OUR LABS INDICATE THAT SCIATIC NERVE MAG- NETIZATION TRANSFER RATIOS (MTR), WHICH ARE SENSITIVE TO MYELIN CONTENT CHANGES FROM DE/DYSMYELINATION AND AXONAL LOSS, RELATE TO DISABILITY ACROSS CMT SUBTYPES, AND ADDITIONAL PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT NERVE MTRS ARE RESPONSIVE TO DISEASE PROGRESSION. MORE RECENT PRELIMINARY AND PUBLISHED DATA INDICATE THAT MRI- BASED NERVE DIAMETER ESTIMATES MAY BE A SPECIFIC BIOMARKER OF CMT1A. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT NERVE MRI MAY YIELD VIABLE BIOMARKERS OF CMT; HOWEVER, QUESTIONS REMAIN REGARDING: I) THE RELATIVE RESPON- SIVENESS OF POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS BASED ON NERVE MRI (MTR AND DIAMETER) AND MUSCLE MRI (INTRAMUSCULAR FAT); II) THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE CANDIDATE BIOMARKERS AND FUNCTION (CMTNS, DYNAMOMETRY), ELECTROPHYSI- OLOGY (NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES, NCS), PATHOLOGY (SKIN BIOPSY), AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE IN THE SAME COHORT; AND III) WHETHER IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF NERVE/MUSCLE YIELD RELIABLE RESULTS ACROSS SITES AND VENDORS FOR USE IN FUTURE TRIALS. WE AIM TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS VIA THE FOLLOWING AIMS: 1) DETERMINE THE RESPONSIVENESS OF MRI-DERIVED NERVE MTR, NERVE DIAMETER, AND INTRAMUSCULAR FAT PERCENTAGE VALUES TO DISEASE PROGRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH CMT1A AND 2) DETERMINE THE INTER-SITE AND INTER-VENDOR REPRODUCIBILITY AND REPEATABILITY OF NERVE MTR, NERVE DIAMETER, AND INTRAMUSCULAR FAT PERCENTAGE VALUES. THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS UPON EXISTING EXPERTISE OF THE TEAMS AT WAYNE STATE AND THE BARROW NEUROLOGICAL INSTITUTE AND IS DESIGNED FOR EACH AIM TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN PARALLEL WITH COORDINATED EFFORT ACROSS SITES.

VLX-1005, A 12-LOX INHIBITOR THAT POTENTLY INHIBITS IMMUNE-MEDIATED THROMBOSIS INCLUDING HIT/T, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TREAT HIT/T IN PATIENTS. HIT/T IS AN ACQUIRED LIFE-THREATENING THROMBOCYTOPENIC AND THROMBOTIC COMPLICATIONS THAT OCCUR IN PATIENTS EXPOSED TO UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN (UFH) OR LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT HEPARIN (LMWH): THE MOST WIDELY USED ANTICOAGULANTS IN THE WORLD. APPROXIMATELY 12 MILLION PATIENTS ARE EXPOSED TO UFH AND LMWH ANNUALLY IN THE US ALONE WITH ~24,000 DEVELOPING HIT/T EVERY YEAR. HIT/T OFTEN RESULTS IN ABERRANT PLATELET ACTIVATION AND AGGREGATION LEADING TO A) PLATELET-DERIVED MICROPARTICLE RELEASE, B) INCREASED THROMBIN GENERATION LEADING TO CATASTROPHIC ARTERIAL AND VENOUS THROMBOSIS THAT RESULTS IN VENOUS LIMB GANGRENE, C) DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS, AND D) PULMONARY EMBOLISM AND DEATH. CURRENT TREATMENT OF HIT/T IS LIMITED TO ARGATROBAN (A DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITOR). UNFORTUNATELY, THIS CARRIES A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF SEVERE BLEEDING LIMITED ITS EFFECTIVENESS. RECENT EVIDENCE HAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE ENZYME 12- LIPOXYGENASE (12-LOX), AND ITS METABOLIC PRODUCT, 12- HYDROXYEICOSATETRAENOIC ACID (12-HETE) ARE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE UNDERLYING PATHOLOGY OF HIT/T INCLUDING PROMOTING PLATELET REACTIVITY, THROMBUS FORMATION/STABILITY AS WELL AS VESSEL OCCLUSION. VLX-1005 SELECTIVELY AND POTENTLY INHIBITS 12-LOX, HALTS ABERRANT PLATELET ACTIVATION AND THROMBOSIS AND HAS SHOWN EFFICACY IN NUMEROUS ANIMAL MODELS, INCLUDING MESENTERIC ARTERIOLE INJURY AND LASER-INDUCED CREMASTER ARTERIOLE THROMBOSIS. WHILE THE DEVELOPMENT OF VLX-1005 FOR TREATMENT OF HIT/T IS RAPIDLY PROGRESSING, IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE HIGHLY SENSITIVE BIOMARKERS FOR ASSESSMENT OF VLX-1005 AS IT INTERVENES AND PREVENTS MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OFTEN OBSERVED WITH THE DISEASE. TO THIS END, WE PROPOSE 2 AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN FOR CLINICAL TRIAL READINESS. IN AIM 1, SEVERAL BIOMARKERS FOR COAGULATION STATE AND PLATELET ACTIVATION WILL BE ASSESSED INCLUDING THE THROMBIN-ANTITHROMBIN (TAT) ELISA ASSAY, 12-HETE ASSAY, LIGHT TRANSMISSION AGGREGOMETRY (LTA), AND WHOLE BLOOD IMPEDANCE AGGREGOMETRY (WBIA) IN MOUSE MODELS OF HIT/T. THESE BIOMARKERS WILL SERVE AS AN INDICATOR OF VLX-1005 EFFECTS ON BOTH COAGULATION AND PLATELET ACTIVATION. AS VLX-1005 HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO EFFECT COAGULATION OR FIBRIN FORMATION, WE DO NOT EXPECT VLX-1005 TO ALTER COAGULATION CONDITIONS IN THE PATIENT, HOWEVER SINCE A DECREASED PLATELET ACTIVATION ENVIRONMENT MAY RESULT IN DECREASED THROMBIN ACTIVATION, THESE BIOMARKER WILL INFORM IF VLX-1005 IS ALTERING UPSTREAM COAGULATION. AIM 2 WILL TAKE THE BIOMARKER OPTIMIZATION FROM AIM 1 AND APPLY IT TO HUMAN BLOOD SAMPLES EX VIVO TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THE BIOMARKERS TO REPORT VLX-1005 EFFECTS IN THE BLOOD.

THE 51ST DRUG METABOLISM GRC WILL FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE NEXT 50 YEARS OF ADME SCIENCE. EMPHASIS WILL BE ON CUTTING-EDGE SCIENCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERCONNECTEDNESS AMONG ADME DISCIPLINES SO THAT WE FULLY TAP INTO THE POTENTIAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND NOVEL APPROACHES IN DISCOVERING, DEVELOPING, AND SAFELY USING MEDICINE FROM DIVERSE MODALITIES. THE CONFERENCE WILL BRING TOGETHER ACADEMIC, INDUSTRY AND REGULATORY SCIENTISTS AT ALL CAREER STAGES AND PROVIDE A STIMULATING AND COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT TO DISCUSS UNPUBLISHED RESEARCH AND LEARN ABOUT THE ADME CHALLENGES OF DIVERSE MODALITIES. THE INFORMAL VENUE OF THE DRUG METABOLISM GRC PROVIDES AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT TO ESTABLISH THIS. THIS CONFERENCE WILL PROVIDE A FORUM FOR EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS TO EXPAND THEIR SCIENTIFIC BREADTH, INTERACT WITH LEADERS IN THE FIELD, ESTABLISH FUTURE COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS, AND CONSIDER VARIOUS CAREER PATHS. A GORDON RESEARCH SEMINAR WILL PRECEDE THE MAIN GRC CONFERENCE, PROVIDING A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS AND EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS TO PRESENT THEIR WORK, CONNECT AND HAVE ACCESS TO MENTORING.

PRESENTED BY CLEVELAND CLINIC\u2019S GENOMIC MEDICINE INSTITUTE AND CENTER FOR PERSONALIZED GENETIC HEALTHCARE AND ENDORSED BY THE PTEN HAMARTOMA TUMOR SYNDROME FOUNDATION AND PTEN ITALIA, THE SYMPOSIUM WILL OFFER STATE-OF-THE-ART INFORMATION TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TREATING PATIENTS WITH GERMLINE PTEN MUTATIONS AND PROVIDE A FORUM FOR MEMBERS OF THE PHTS PATIENT COMMUNITY TO CONNECT AND LEARN ABOUT CUTTING-EDGE PTEN RESEARCH AS WELL AS CLINICAL SURVEILLANCE AND MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES. PHTS IS A RARE, COMPLEX DISORDER AFFECTING MULTIPLE ORGANS OVER THE LIFESPAN WITH DIFFERING MANIFESTATIONS BASED ON AGE. PATIENTS WITH A PTEN MUTATION REQUIRE LIFETIME FOLLOW-UP FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONCERNS AND CANCER RISK SURVEILLANCE AS WELL AS FAMILIAL SCREENING AND EVALUATION. A COMPREHENSIVE CARE MODEL THAT INCLUDES BOTH PEDIATRIC AND ADULT SPECIALISTS FAMILIAR WITH THIS CONDITION AND PREPARED TO PROVIDE OPTIMAL CARE IS NECESSARY. UNFORTUNATELY, PHTS IS NOT WELL KNOWN TO MANY CLINICIANS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TO ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, THE PROGRAM IS CENTERED ON THE FOLLOWING LEARNING OBJECTIVES: (1) DESCRIBE CURRENT PTEN TRANSLATIONAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH, (2) APPLY RESEARCH INFORMATION ABOUT PHTS TO DIAGNOSIS, SCREENING, SURVEILLANCE, GUIDELINES, PATIENT NEEDS, CLINICAL FEATURES AND COORDINATION OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM CARE AND (3) DEMONSTRATE AWARENESS AND SHARE EDUCATION ABOUT PHTS, LEADING TO TIMELY DIAGNOSIS, APPROPRIATE SURVEILLANCE AND IMPROVED PATIENT OUTCOMES. EXPERT CLEVELAND CLINIC AND GUEST FACULTY WILL SHARE RESEARCH AND CASE-BASED PRESENTATIONS HIGHLIGHTING THE ADVANCES OF GENETICS AND GENOMICS OF PHTS AND THE SCIENCE OF PTEN. TOPICS INCLUDE PTEN BIOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS, NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS, HEREDITARY BREAST CANCER, GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER, UPDATES ON PTEN RESEARCH AND CLINICAL TRIALS, PTEN-RELATED VASCULAR ANOMALIES, AND STRESS AND RESILIENCE IN COPING WITH PHTS. THE PROGRAM ALSO WILL INCORPORATE A PATIENT EXPERIENCE PANEL, WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR UNIQUE PATIENT PERSPECTIVES ON PHTS.

WHILE MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN REVEALING MECHANISMS OF AUTOPHAGY AND THE UBIQUITIN-PROTEASOME SYSTEM, THE MAJOR PROTEIN DEGRADATION PATHWAYS DEFINED THUS FAR, THESE FIELDS CONTINUE TO REMAIN ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER DESPITE THE INTERCONNECTION OF THESE PROCESSES. THIS SEPARATION IS NOW LEADING TO AN URGENT NEED TO DISCUSS THE INTERPLAY OF THESE PATHWAYS AT THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR LEVELS TO INTEGRATE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PROCESSES AND HOW THEY CONTRIBUTE TO DISEASE PATHOLOGY. THIS CONFERENCE WILL BRING TOGETHER RESEARCHERS FROM THESE DIFFERENT FIELDS, WHO DO NOT TYPICALLY INTERACT, TO BUILD A HOLISTIC AND INTEGRATED VISION OF PROTEIN DEGRADATION. SUCH AN INTEGRATIVE CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF PROTEIN DEGRADATION RESEARCH DOES NOT YET EXIST, SO THIS KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA CONFERENCE WILL BE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND TO RESHAPE HOW THESE FIELDS INTERACT AND COLLABORATE TO YIELD TRANSFORMATIVE INSIGHTS INTO BOTH BASIC SCIENCE AND DISEASE PROCESSES. TOPICS OF DISCUSSION WILL INCLUDE: (1) SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION AND PROCESSING BY ENERGY-DEPENDENT PROTEASES, AUTOPHAGY AND LYSOSOMAL PATHWAYS; (2) SIGNALS TARGETING PROTEINS TO DISTINCT DEGRADATION PATHWAYS; (3) INTERPLAY BETWEEN PROTEOLYTIC SYSTEMS AND CHAPERONE PATHWAYS; (4) REPROGRAMMING DEGRADATION WITH SMALL MOLECULES FOR THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS; (5) DEGRADATION PROGRAMS DRIVING GLOBAL PROTEOME REMODELING.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE 20TH INTERNATIONAL VASCULITIS & ANCA WORKSHOP IS TO BRING TOGETHER BIOMEDICAL SCIENTISTS AND CLINICIANS, INCLUDING NEW INVESTIGATORS, JUNIOR FACULTY, AND TRAINEES, WHO ARE INTERESTED IN CLINICAL, TRANSLATIONAL, AND BASIC SCIENCE DISCOVERIES AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE RESULTS WITH PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, GENETICS/GENOMICS, AND BIOMARKERS OF VASCULITIS AND DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL THERAPIES FOR THIS FASCINATING GROUP OF ORGAN- AND LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES. SINCE THE FIRST WORKSHOP IN 1988, THIS BIANNUAL MEETING HAS ATTRACTED AN INCREASING NUMBER OF SCIENTISTS FROM MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES AND CLINICIANS FROM MANY SPECIALTIES. THE WORKSHOP IS A UNIQUE VENUE FOR ADDRESSING THE CLINICAL AND SCIENTIFIC COMPLEXITIES AND BROAD SCOPE OF ORGAN INVOLVEMENT THAT ARE THE HALLMARKS OF THE VASCULITIDES, RANGING FROM SMALL TO LARGE VESSEL DISEASES. RESEARCHERS WHO MAY OTHERWISE HAVE LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO CROSS PATHS, GIVEN THEIR VARIED SPECIALTIES AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, ARE PROVIDED WITH AN ENVIRONMENT TO INTERACT AND SHARE IDEAS. THE COMBINATION OF AN AGING SCIENTIFIC WORKFORCE, INCREASED COMPETITION FOR FUNDING FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, FINANCIAL PRESSURES ON ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, AND SHIFTS IN INTERESTS AMONG BIOMEDICAL TRAINEES HAS LED TO A STEADY DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG MD, PHD, AND DUAL-DEGREE INVESTIGATORS DEDICATED TO CAREERS IN HYPOTHESIS-BASED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. THESE PRESSURES ARE ESPECIALLY SEVERE FOR PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO BUILD CAREERS STUDYING ASPECTS OF RARE DISEASES. IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOUNG INVESTIGATORS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO PRESENT THEIR WORK AT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES WHERE THEY CAN RECEIVE MEANINGFUL RECOGNITION AND FEEDBACK, GAIN AWARENESS OF THE BROADER ADVANCES IN THEIR AREAS OF INQUIRY, AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH JUNIOR AND SENIOR COLLEAGUES THAT LEAD TO MEANINGFUL SCIENTIFIC PARTNERSHIPS. IN THIS R13 GRANT APPLICATION, WE OUTLINE PLANS TO USE REQUESTED FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF TRAINEES AND JUNIOR FACULTY IN THE 2021 INTERNATIONAL VASCULITIS & ANCA WORKSHOP TO DIRECTLY ADVANCE THEIR CAREER DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIELD OF VASCULITIS RESEARCH WITH THE GOALS OF EXPANDING THEIR INTEREST IN THE FIELD AND PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION. THE WORKSHOP WILL ALSO FEATURE AN ENRICHMENT PROGRAM TO ASSIST TRAINEES AND JUNIOR FACULTY IN GETTING THE MOST OUT THE WORKSHOP THROUGH I) ORIENTATION TO THE PROGRAM; II) GUIDED POSTER TOURS BY EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATORS HIGHLIGHTING BOTH OUTSTANDING SCIENCE AND THE INTERRELATEDNESS OF THE WORK; AND III) SOCIAL NETWORKING EVENTS TO ENCOURAGE ONGOING COLLABORATIONS AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN THE FIELD OF VASCULITIS.

PROGRESS, ORGANIZED BY DRS. ROBERT THORNE AND REINA BENDAYAN. THE CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD IN BRECKENRIDGE, COLORADO FROM JANUARY 26-39, 2023. THIS KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA CONFERENCE IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE URGENT SCIENTIFIC NEED FOR INNOVATIVE, NEW APPROACHES TO CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) DRUG DELIVERY. INDEED, THE CURRENT SHORTAGE OF DISEASE-MODIFYING TREATMENTS FOR ALZHEIMER\u2019S, PARKINSON\u2019S AND OTHER CNS DISEASES REPRESENT AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT UNMET HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR TIME. OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY TAP INTO THE VAST POTENTIAL THAT PROTEIN, OLIGONUCLEOTIDE, AND GENE THERAPIES HAVE FOR TREATING CNS DISORDERS HAS BEEN SHARPLY LIMITED BY THE TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT BRAIN EXPOSURE THAT RESULTS AFTER THEIR SYSTEMIC OR CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION. EVEN MANY ORALLY ADMINISTERED SMALL MOLECULES SUFFER FROM BRAIN EXPOSURE LIMITATIONS. AMONG THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THESE LIMITATIONS ARE THE PHYSICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL BARRIERS THAT EXIST AT KEY CNS INTERFACES, INCLUDING THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER AT THE LEVEL OF THE CEREBROVASCULATURE, OTHER SPECIALIZED BARRIERS BETWEEN THE BLOOD AND CEREBROSPINAL FLUID, AND FURTHER OBSTACLES HINDERING DRUG EXCHANGE BETWEEN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID AND CNS TISSUE. CNS DRUG DELIVERY RESEARCH LIES AT THE CROSSROADS BETWEEN MANY DIFFERENT FIELDS, INCLUDING PHYSIOLOGY, PHARMACOLOGY, PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE, NEUROSCIENCE, NEUROSURGERY, ENGINEERING, GENETICS, AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY, AMONG OTHERS. SURPRISINGLY FEW CONFERENCES TO DATE HAVE FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH CNS DRUG DELIVERY.

THIS MEETING PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY TO EXCHANGE AND DISCUSS NEW SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES, AND TO CHART INNOVATIVE AND COLLABORATIVE FUTURE SCIENTIFIC DIRECTIONS IN VASCULAR BIOLOGY. THE IVBM HAS ALSO SERVED TO FOSTER THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS IN VASCULAR MEDICINE. IVBM 2022 (OCTOBER 13-17, 2022 IN OAKLAND, CA) WILL COVER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF VASCULAR BIOLOGY, PRIORITIZING EMERGING AREAS OF RESEARCH. THE VASCULATURE IMPACTS EVERY ORGAN SYSTEM IN DEVELOPMENT, AGING, AND DISEASE AND IS CRITICAL TO PROCESSES OF REGENERATION. BLOOD VESSEL WALLS REGULATE MULTIPLE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING VASOMOTOR TONE, LEUKOCYTE TRAFFICKING, INNATE AND ACQUIRED IMMUNITY, PERMEABILITY, STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION, REGENERATION, AND NEW BLOOD FORMATION. ABNORMALITIES IN ANY OF THESE FUNCTIONS LEAD TO DISEASE. BEYOND TRADITIONAL VESSEL WALL PATHOLOGIES SUCH AS ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND HYPERTENSION, THE VASCULATURE CONTRIBUTES TO CANCER, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, DIABETES, HEMATOLOGICAL AND IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS, AGING, AND INFECTIOUS PROCESSES, MOST RECENTLY COVID-19. MOUNTING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MANY COVID-19 SYMPTOMS ARE DUE TO THE VIRUS ATTACKING THE VASCULATURE. ADVANCES IN VASCULAR BIOLOGY HAVE LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANY NEW THERAPIES AND PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES WITH BROAD IMPACT INCLUDING THOSE MITIGATING TUMOR GROWTH AND RESTORING VISION. IVBM 2022 WILL PROVIDE A TIMELY FORUM TO EXCHANGE NEW KNOWLEDGE IN THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING FIELD OF VASCULAR BIOLOGY, FACILITATE CROSS-DISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION AND CRITICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SEASONED INVESTIGATORS AND TRAINEES, AND PROMOTE AWARENESS OF DIVERSE VASCULAR BEDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE.

YET THERE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT ETHICAL AND ECONOMIC NEED TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN FROM RARE DISEASES. TO MEET THIS NEED, THE NIH HAS RELEASED RFA-TR-22-030: PILOT PROJECTS INVESTIGATING UNDERSTUDIED PROTEINS ASSOCIATED WITH RARE DISEASES, TO WHICH WE RESPOND WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSAL. THIS PILOT PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP BIOCHEMICAL REAGENTS AND ASSAYS CAPABLE OF DEFINING THE STRUCTURE AND MOLECULAR-SCALE FUNCTION OF A PAX3-FOXO1 FUSION PROTEIN THAT IS KNOWN TO DRIVE THE PHENOTYPE OF THE RARE DISEASE ALVEOLAR RHABDOMYOSARCOMA. MOTIVATED BY OUR INTEREST IN TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TRANSACTIVATION DOMAINS, THE PI'S LABORATORY HAS CONTRIBUTED NOVEL NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY TECHNIQUES THAT EMPOWER HIGH RESOLUTION INVESTIGATION OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TRANSACTIVATION DOMAINS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH DOWNSTREAM COREGULATORS, YIELDING A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE UNMET NEED FOR MECHANISTIC STUDIES OF PAX3-FOXO1 FUSION PROTEIN FUNCTION THAT WILL ENABLE DOWNSTREAM LEAD COMPOUND SCREENING AND EVENTUAL DRUG DEVELOPMENT.

IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 97% OF PPS CASES CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY MUTATIONS THAT AFFECT RESIDUES OF THE DNA BINDING DOMAIN OF THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR 6 (IRF6). CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF PPS INCLUDE CLEFT LIP WITH OR WITHOUT CLEFT PALATE, AND A VARIETY OF TISSUE ADHESIONS, INCLUDING PTERYGIUM (TISSUE FUSION OR WEBBING) BEHIND THE KNEES (POPLITEAL REGION), SYNDACTYLY, ANKYLOBLEPHARON (FUSION OF EYELIDS), AND FUSIONS AROUND THE GENITAL REGION. ABSENCE OF THE PERIDERM, A SINGLE LAYER OF EPITHELIAL CELLS THAT COVERS THE DEVELOPING EPIDERMIS DURING EMBRYOGENESIS, IS BELIEVED TO UNDERLIE THESE ABERRANT TISSUE ADHESIONS. RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PERIDERM, AND STUDIES AIMED AT UNDERLYING THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF PPS MAY PROVIDE NEW INSIGHT WITH BROAD SIGNIFICANCE FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW EMBRYONIC ECTODERM GIVES RISE TO THE RICH COMPLEXITY OF SKIN AND ORAL EPITHELIA. WE FOUND THAT TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS IMPLICATED IN EPIDERMAL DIFFERENTIATION, INCLUDING IRF6, ARE EXPRESSED IN THE PERIDERM. YET, THE FIELD LACKS IN THE AVAILABILTITY OF BIOMARKERS THAT SPECIFICIALLY REFLECT THE GENESIS, FUNCTION AND FATE OF PERIDERM CELLS, ACCOUNTING FOR OUR SUPERFICIAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DEFECTS IN THE PERIDERM MAY CONTRIBUTE TO PPS. ESTABLISHED MARKERS OF THE PERIDERM ARE ABSENT IN THE DEVELOPING ECTODERM OF IRF6-DEFICIENT MICE. IN THE LATTER SETTING, ABNORMAL TISSUE ADHESIONS OCCUR IN THE ORAL CAVITY AND DIFFERENTIATION OF KERATINOCYTES IN THE DEVELOPING EPIDERMIS IS COMPROMISED. OUR PRIOR STUDIES ALSO REVEALED THAT IRF6-DEFICIENT KERATINOCYTES CAN STRATIFY, BUT CANNOT GIVE RISE TO PERIDERM. WHILE THESE OBSERVATIONS ESTABLISH THAT IRF6 IS ESSENTIAL FOR SPECIFICATION OF THE PERIDERM, HOW IT AFFECTS MORPHOGENESIS OF THE PERIDERM AND HOW THE PERIDERM PREVENTS TISSUE FUSION REMAIN ILL-DEFINED. THE PREMISE OF OUR STUDY IS THAT A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF PPS REQUIRES A MUCH MORE PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF IRF6 IN THE FORMATION OF THE PERIDERM. TOWARD THIS END, WE HEREIN PROPOSE TO DEFINE HOW THE PERIDERM INITIALLY FORMS, AND IDENTIFY THE IRF6-DEPENDENT GENE REGULATORY NETWORKS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS INITIAL MORPHOGENIC EVENT. TO TEST OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT PERIDERM CELLS PRESENT A UNIQUE GENE EXPRESSION PROFILE THROUGHOUT ITS GENESIS AND FATE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY IRF6 LEVELS, WE WILL GENERATE CELLULAR LIBRARIES FROM WILD-TYPE AND IRF6-DEFICIENT EPIDERMIS OBTAINED FROM EMBRYOS AT DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL TIME POINTS CRITICAL FOR PERIDERM MORPHOGENESIS AND PERFORM SINGLE-CELL RNA SEQUENCING, FOLLOWED BY MULTIPLEX IN SITU AND IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE VALIDATION.

CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYSREGULATION OF CHROMATIN IN PAH PATHOGENESIS REMAINS LIMITED. THE SWITCH/SUCROSE NON- FERMENTABLE (SWI/SNF) CHROMATIN REMODELING COMPLEXES CONTROL ACCESSIBILITY OF CHROMATIN TO TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND COREGULATORY MACHINERIES.

THE HYPOTHESIS IS SUPPORTED BY PRELIMINARY DATA OF THE DOWNREGULATION OF ARID1A EXPRESSION LEVEL IN HUMAN AND ANIMAL MODELS OF PAH. IMPORTANTLY, ARID1A DEPLETION USING SHRNA INCREASED PASMC PROLIFERATION AND INCREASED EZH2 EXPRESSION.

IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR YEARS THAT GROWTH FACTORS, SUCH AS PLATELET-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR AND FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR, ACT THROUGH TYROSINE KINASE RECEPTORS TO PROMOTE PULMONARY VASCULAR REMODELING IN PAH. IMATINIB, A NON-SPECIFIC TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR SHOWED PROMISE IN ANIMAL MODELS OF PAH AND SEVERAL CASE REPORTS DEMONSTRATED CURES OF PAH WITH IMATINIB. A PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL OF IMATINIB IN PAH SHOWED MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN EXERCISE CAPACITY IN SOME PATIENTS BUT DID NOT RECEIVE FDA APPROVAL BECAUSE THE DRUG WAS NOT WELL TOLERATED. WE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND NOVEL MECHANISMS OF IMATINIB EFFECT IN PAH. IN PRELIMINARY DATA, WE ADMINISTERED IMATINIB TO MICE THAT EXPRESS A HUMAN MUTATION THAT IS KNOWN TO CAUSE HERITABLE FORMS OF PAH (BONE MORPHOGENETIC RECEPTOR TYPE 2, BMPR2) AND TESTED CHANGES IN PLASMA PROTEOMICS AS A NOVEL WAY OF DETECTING KEY DRUG EFFECTS IN A MANNER THAT COULD BE TRANSLATED TO HUMANS AND MAY LEND MECHANISTIC INSIGHT.

AS A CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, THE CORE SYMPTOM OF MYHRE SYNDROME IS LIFE-THREATENING PROGRESSIVE FIBROSIS IN MULTIPLE ORGANS. SMAD4 GENE ENCODES A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF THE TGF/BMP/SMAD SIGNALING PATHWAY THAT IS INVOLVED IN MANY CELLULAR PROCESSES IN BOTH THE ADULT ORGANISM AND THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO. MUTATIONS OR DELETIONS IN THE SMAD4 GENE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO RESULT IN VARIOUS DISORDERS INCLUDING HEREDITARY DISEASES AND CANCERS. INTRIGUINGLY, MYHRE SYNDROME IS ONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE MISSENSE MUTATIONS AT ILE500 IN SMAD4. THE INVARIANT LOCATION AND RESTRICTED SPECTRUM OF MYHRE SYNDROME-CAUSATIVE MUTATIONS SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ALTERATION IN ILE500 HAS DISTINCT AND SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES ON SMAD4 FUNCTION, RESULTING IN MYHRE SYNDROME.

SETD5 INTERACTS WITH THE NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-COREPRESSOR (NCOR) COMPLEX TO REGULATE HISTONE ACETYLATION. OUR PREVIOUS WORK ON MMD-CAUSING PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IN ACTA2 SHOWED THAT THESE VARIANTS IMPAIR SMC DIFFERENTIATION, AND THE INCOMPLETELY DIFFERENTIATED CELLS HAVE INCREASED PROLIFERATION AND MIGRATION AND RELY ON GLYCOLYSIS FOR CELLULAR ENERGY PRODUCTION.

OCT4 CAN BIND TO DNA IN DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC DNA SEQUENCE RECOGNIZED. USING AN AFFINITY PURIFICATION/MASS SPECTROMETRY APPROACH, WE IDENTIFIED TRANSCRIPTION COFACTORS WHOSE AFFINITY FOR OCT4 IS ALTERED BY THE DNA SEQUENCE.

THIS FAILURE PRESENTS A TIMELY OPPORTUNITY TO TEST NEW PROGNOSTIC MARKERS TO TARGET DE-INTENSIFIED THERAPY IN THE 41 EXISTING CLINICAL TRIALS, BUT A LACK OF PROMISING BIOMARKERS HINDERS PROGRESS.

RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWED THAT THE WARBURG EFFECT, THE ATYPICAL METABOLIC STATE IN WHICH A TUMOR UPREGULATES GLYCOLYSIS BUT BYPASSES MITOCHONDRIAL OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION (OXPHOS), IS A KEY DISCRIMINATING CHARACTERISTIC BETWEEN HNC CELL LINES LINKED TO PROGNOSIS.

THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATIONS FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF ENDOGENOUS CANNABINOIDS AS MEDIATORS OF UPPER AND LOWER AIRWAY INFLAMMATION IN ASPIRIN-EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE (AERD). AERD IS CLINICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY MODERATE TO SEVERE ASTHMA, NASAL POLYPS AND ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS TO ASPIRIN AND OTHER NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS). ASPIRIN CHALLENGE REPRESENTS THE GOLD-STANDARD TO DIAGNOSE AERD, BUT IS POORLY UTILIZED DUE TO LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF SPECIALIZED PROVIDERS AND CONCERNS OF ADVERSE REACTIONS TO THE PROCEDURE. THEREFORE, UP TO 42% OF PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA AND NASAL POLYPS FAIL TO RECEIVE AN ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF AERD, RESULTING IN INADEQUATE TREATMENT MARKED BY MULTIPLE SINUS SURGERIES, IRREVERSIBLE AIRWAY REMODELING AND AN ANNUAL U.S. HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE OF >$4.5 BILLION.

THE ANNUAL MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE IS 17.4 PER 100,000 PREGNANCIES (~ 700 MOTHERS) AND THE PERINATAL MORTALITY RATE IS 1 IN 160 BIRTHS (~24,000 BABIES). MANY OF THESE MOTHERS ALSO SUFFER LONG-TERM CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS, AND MANY OF THE NEWBORNS ARE PREDISPOSED TO ILLNESS IN ADULT LIFE. HENCE, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO IMPROVE VISUALIZATION OF THE PLACENTA, AND TO ASSESS AND IMPROVE ITS FUNCTION AND POTENTIALLY TREAT AND PREVENT THESE SCENARIOS WITH ADVERSE OUTCOMES. THE MAINSTAY FOR ASSESSMENT OF THE PLACENTA IS ULTRASOUND WITH MRI AS AN ADDITIONAL MODALITY. CONTRAST-ENHANCED MRI CAN SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE DETECTION AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PLACENTA, BUT USE OF CONTRAST AGENTS DURING PREGNANCY IS DISCOURAGED AS LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT COMPOUNDS CROSS THE PLACENTA AND CAN INCUR FETAL TOXICITY. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR BIOCOMPATIBLE CARRIERS TO SPECIFICALLY DELIVER MRI CONTRAST AGENTS TO THE PLACENTA WITH NEGLIGIBLE FETAL EXPOSURE. SUCH CARRIERS ARE ALSO NEEDED FOR DELIVERY OF CONTRAST AGENTS FOR EMERGING IMAGING MODALITIES (E.G., PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGING) AND THERAPEUTICS FOR TREATING PLACENTA DISORDERS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP BIOCOMPATIBLE CARRIERS FOR PLACENTA-SPECIFIC DELIVERY OF IMAGING AND THERAPEUTIC AGENTS AT DIFFERENT GESTATIONAL AGES.

A CRITICAL BOTTLENECK IN THE TRANSLATION OF NOVEL GENE THERAPIES TO CLINICAL TRIALS IS A LACK OF HUMAN MODELS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING FUNCTIONAL METRICS THAT CORRELATE WITH PATIENT OUTCOMES AND PROVIDE PREDICTIVE DATA WITH WHICH TO GUIDE SUBSEQUENT IN VIVO EXPERIMENTS. FOR ALS AND OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS, THE COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH GENERATING MATURE AND FUNCTIONALLY COMPETENT NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTIONS (NMJS) IN CULTURE WITH SUFFICIENT THROUGHPUT FOR SCREENING PURPOSES IS A MAJOR HINDRANCE TO THIS EFFORT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTIPLEXED PLATFORM CAPABLE OF PROMOTING NMJ DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A PARALLEL ARRAY OF ENGINEERED MUSCLE TISSUES WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL POSITIVE IMPACT ON ADVANCED THERAPY DEVELOPMENT, DRUG EFFICACY/TOXICITY SCREENING, AND MECHANISTIC STUDIES OF NEURONAL AND NMJ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY IN ALS.

RESEARCH AIMS: TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, OUR PROJECT HAS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) EXPLORE HOSPITAL DATA-SHARING POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH COMMERCIAL ENTITIES, AND THEIR INDUSTRY AND PATIENT RELATIONSHIPS, (2) CHARACTERIZE THE KINDS OF HOSPITALS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY, ARE INTERESTED IN, AND/OR HAVE SHARED PATIENT DATA WITH INDUSTRY AND MEASURE THE KINDS OF PATIENT IMPACT THAT MIGHT DRIVE CHANGE TO SPECIFIC DATA-SHARING PRACTICES, AND (3) EXAMINE THE ACCEPTABILITY OF HOSPITAL DATA-SHARING PRACTICES, PREFERENCES AMONGST ACCEPTABLE PRACTICES, AND ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF UNACCEPTABLE PRACTICES GENERALLY AS WELL AS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY SPECIFICALLY. IMPACT: PATIENT DISCOMFORT WITH HOSPITAL DATA SHARING PRACTICES THAT PATIENTS FIND UNACCEPTABLE \u2013 AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH RACE AND ETHNICITY \u2013 IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR INCREASING THE ACCESSIBILITY AND GENERALIZABILITY OF TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE ADVANCES. THOUGH OUR MIXED METHODS ELSI APPROACH TO DISCOVERING AREAS FOR COMPROMISE BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND PATIENTS, WHILE CENTERING THOSE HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED, THIS PROPOSAL WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON IMPROVING DATA-SHARING PRACTICES TO FACILITATE DIVERSITY IN DATA USED TO SUPPORT HIGH-IMPACT TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1567efcf-bcdb-61b9-72f2-70cbed5fa626-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01TR004244_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151144796, "Award ID": "R01TR004243", "Award Amount": 1007076.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-09", "CFDA Number": "93.310", "Description": "ETHICAL AND HUMAN FACTORS IMPACTING SUCCESSFUL TRANSLATION OF PERCEPTUAL COMPUTING TO IMPROVE CLINICAL CARE - PROJECT SUMMARY PERCEPTUAL COMPUTING (PC), IN COMBINATION WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING (AI/ML), IS POISED TO REVOLUTIONIZE CLINICAL APPROACHES TO DIAGNOSIS, PERSONALIZED TREATMENT (PRECISION MEDICINE), SYMPTOM AND OUT- COME MONITORING, TELEMEDICINE/MOBILE HEALTH, AND PRIMARY PREVENTION ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF DISORDERS. PC TOOLS ARE RAPIDLY EXPANDING BUT UNRESOLVED ETHICAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES STAND IN THE WAY OF RESPONSIBLE TRANSLATION INTO CLINICAL CARE. THESE CHALLENGES STEM FROM THE SPECIFIC, NOVEL FEATURES OF PC METRICS, WHICH DIFFER FROM TRADI- TIONAL MEASURES OF EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN THAT THEY 1) REPRESENT OBJECTIVELY OBSERVED RATHER THAN SUB- JECTIVELY ELICITED STATES AND MAY INVOLVE COLLECTION OF DIGITAL DATA THAT PATIENTS MAY NOT BE AWARE OF OR WISH TO SHARE WITH THEIR CLINICIANS; 2) COLLECT DATA PASSIVELY USING DIGITAL DEVICES THAT OBSERVE AND REGISTER MOMENT-TO- MOMENT EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL INFORMATION; 3) YIELD VOLUMINOUS MATERIAL (I.E. \u201cBIG DATA\u201d) THAT IS DIFFICULT TO SCALE INTO ACTIONABLE INFORMATION AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL; AND 4) REST ON DATA EASY TO COLLECT AND MAKE INFERENCES FROM, INVITING ENGAGEMENT FROM COMMERCIAL AND OTHER ENTITIES WHOSE GOALS MAY BE PROFIT-DRIVEN RATHER THAN FIDU- CIARY, AS IN HEALTHCARE.

OUR PROGRAM HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED NATIONALLY FOR THE DIVERSITY OF ITS SCHOLARS, WITH 55% WOMEN AND 33% UNDER-REPRESENTED PERSONS. IT IS ALSO RECOGNIZED FOR FORMING AND CO-LEADING A NATIONAL KL2 PI/DIRECTORS CONSORTIUM GROUP, WHICH MEETS REGULARLY TO NETWORK, SHARE BEST PRACTICES, AND DEVELOP INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE VIRTUAL CTSA VISITING SCHOLARS PROGRAM, IN WHICH KL2 SCHOLARS THROUGHOUT THE CTSA CONSORTIUM CAN VISIT OTHER CTSA HUBS TO NETWORK WITH EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD AND TO DELIVER A NATIONALLY STREAMED CTSA GRAND ROUNDS. OUR KL2 PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED 2 YEARS OF SUPPORT FOR OUR SCHOLARS, WITH A REQUIRED THIRD YEAR OF SUPPORT FUNDED BY THE SCHOLAR\u2019S HOME DEPARTMENT. TO DATE, OUR KL2 PROGRAM, LIKE OTHERS IN THE CTSA CONSORTIUM, HAS FOCUSED ON TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH \u2013 THE ENDEAVOR TO TRAVERSE A PARTICULAR STEP OF THE TRANSLATIONAL PROCESS FOR A PARTICULAR TARGET OR DISEASE. YET, HISTORICALLY, THE PROCESS OF TRANSLATION HAS BEEN NOTORIOUSLY SLOW. FOR THE NEW K12 PROGRAM, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD A FOCUS ON TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE, THE FIELD OF INVESTIGATION FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENTIFIC AND OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING EACH STEP OF THE TRANSLATIONAL PROCESS IN ORDER TO CATALYZE TRANSLATION. AS SUCH, WE WILL INCORPORATE NEW TRAINING IN TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE BASED ON COMPETENCIES WE PUBLISHED FOR A TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCHER VS. A TRANSLATIONAL SCIENTIST; DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND ACCESSIBILITY; DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION; AND LEADERSHIP. THE CURRICULUM WILL BE CO-DEVELOPED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH CTSA AND TARGETED TO K12 SCHOLARS FROM BOTH CTSA HUBS, T32 TRAINEES, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE WORKFORCE; ONCE DEVELOPED, THE CURRICULUM WILL BE SHARED WITH THE CTSA CONSORTIUM. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR RIGOROUS AND INCLUSIVE SCHOLAR SELECTION PROCESS. FOR THEIR RESEARCH PROJECTS, EACH K12 SCHOLAR WILL INCORPORATE A COMPONENT OF TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE. SCHOLARS WILL BE MENTORED BY A TEAM OF MENTORS, INCLUDING A CLINICIAN; THE PRIMARY MENTORS WILL UNDERGO EVIDENCE-BASED MENTOR TRAINING, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON MENTORING UNDER-REPRESENTED SCHOLARS. WITH THE FORMALIZATION OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH UT AUSTIN, UT SAN ANTONIO, AND TEXAS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CTSA-FUNDED SCHOLARS FROM THE CURRENT 4 AT A TIME TO 5 AT A TIME, PLUS 3 INSTITUTIONALLY FUNDED SCHOLARS. WE WILL DIVERSIFY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE K12 BY ADDING A FEMALE MULTI-PI FROM UT AUSTIN AND BY MENTORING AN UNDER-REPRESENTED FORMER SCHOLAR TO BECOME A K12 PROGRAM LEADER. TO CONTINUE THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL VIRTUAL CTSA VISITING SCHOLAR PROGRAM ONCE SUPPORT BY THE NATIONAL CTSA COORDINATING CENTER SUNSETS, WE, WITH K12/KL2 PROGRAMS AT HARVARD, THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, AND STANFORD, WILL ASSUME MANAGEMENT OF THE PROGRAM, CREATE INNOVATIVE FEATURES, AND EVALUATE PROGRAM AND SCHOLAR EXPERIENCES.

THIS SCIENTIST IS FLUENT IN THE LANGUAGE OF TEAM SCIENCE AND COLLABORATION AND RECOGNIZES THE PRINCIPLES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATION ACROSS DISCIPLINES. THIS SCIENTIST BRINGS AN INCLUSIVE MINDSET TO HOW THEY FORM AND LEAD THEIR RESEARCH TEAMS AS WELL AS THE METHODS THEY USE IN THEIR RESEARCH. THESE CHARACTERISTICS DESCRIBE A TRANSLATIONAL SCIENTIST. TRANSFORMING TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCHERS, HISTORICALLY TRAINED IN DISCIPLINE- AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC APPROACHES, INTO TRANSLATIONAL SCIENTISTS REQUIRES A DEPARTURE FROM TRADITIONAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, THE PROPOSED NEW CTSA K12 PROGRAM, THE GENE ORRINGER ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL (UNC-CH), WILL SUPPORT NINE EARLY-CAREER SCHOLARS WITH AT LEAST 75% PROTECTED TIME FOR RESEARCH AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR UP TO 3 YEARS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CTSA K12 ARE TO: 1) RECRUIT JUNIOR FACULTY WHO ARE DEDICATED TO ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BIOMEDICAL ADVANCES THROUGH PURSUIT OF TEAM-BASED TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE; 2) INCREASE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS OF SCHOLARS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES; 3) PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROTECTED TIME FOR SCHOLARS TO DEVELOP SKILLS IN THE SEVEN TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE CHARACTERISTICS THROUGH MENTORED, DIDACTIC, AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING IN A FORMAT ADAPTED TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS; 4) EMPOWER SCHOLARS WITH THE NECESSARY LEADERSHIP, MANAGEMENT, WELL-BEING, AND RESILIENCE SKILLS AND DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION TRAINING NEEDED TO LEAD DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS THROUGH DIDACTIC AND EXPERIENTIAL TRAININGS, CAREER COACHING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCES; 5) PREPARE SCHOLARS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES THROUGH FOCUSED TRAININGS AND APPLIED EXPERIENCES IN SYSTEMS SCIENCE, HEALTH EQUITY AND COMMUNITY/STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT; 6) OPTIMIZE MENTORING COMMITTEE-SCHOLAR RELATIONSHIPS BY REQUIRING MENTOR AND MENTEE TRAINING BASED ON EVIDENCE-INFORMED MENTORING PRACTICES AND ACTIVE ASSESSMENT OF MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS; 7) DEVELOP SCHOLARS INTO EFFECTIVE MENTORS FOR MENTEES FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS THROUGH DIDACTIC TRAINING AND MENTOR SKILLS DEVELOPMENT; 8) INTEGRATE SCHOLARS INTO PROGRAMS AND SERVICES OF THE CURRENT AND PLANNED LOCAL UM1 AND COMPANION GRANTS AND THE CTSA CONSORTIUM.

THE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE (ICTS) IS THE SCIENTIFIC HOME FOR THE CTS INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANY OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY AND IS THE ENTITY CHARGED WITH INTEGRATING CTS INTO THE HEALTH CARE AND RESEARCH ENVIRONMENTS AT THE UI. AS WE ENVISIONED THE K12 PROGRAM, WE USED THE UI HEALTH CARE STRATEGIC GOALS TO DESIGN A PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF OUR STATE AND THAT TRAINS A CTS WORKFORCE TO ACCELERATE THE PACE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY DRIVING SCIENCE FROM THE BENCH TO THE BEDSIDE AND INTO THE COMMUNITY. NEARLY 40% OF IOWA'S POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL REGIONS OF THE STATE WHERE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS CHALLENGED AND MANY DISEASE OUTCOMES ARE INFERIOR TO THOSE SEEN IN URBAN POPULATIONS. RESOLVING THESE RURAL DISPARITIES REQUIRES SCIENTIFIC AND HEALTH CARE APPROACHES THAT CAN ADAPT TO GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE AND MAKE USE OF THE EXISTING SYSTEMS OF CARE THAT ARE IN PLACE IN SPARSELY POPULATED AREAS. HEALTH DELIVERY IN RURAL IOWA IS DEPENDENT ON TEAM-BASED CARE THAT INCORPORATES ALLIED HEALTH PROVIDERS SUCH AS PHARMACISTS, PHYSICAL THERAPISTS, MID-LEVEL PRACTITIONERS, DENTISTS AND IMPORTANTLY, COMMUNITY SERVICES. OUR RESEARCH AGENDA ADDRESSES THE NEED TO ENGAGE RURAL POPULATIONS IN PRACTICAL WAYS CLOSER TO THEIR HOMES AND TO TRAIN OUR SCIENTISTS TO WORK IN MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAMS THAT INCLUDE AND VALUE INTEGRATION OF COMMUNITY AND ALLIED HEALTH PROVIDERS INTO RESEARCH. ACCORDINGLY, OUR K12 PROGRAM INTENTIONALLY SOLICITS SCHOLARS FROM ALL HEALTH PROFESSIONS. THE OBJECTIVES OF OUR K12 PROGRAM ARE  1) RECRUIT AND TRAIN OUTSTANDING SCHOLARS (CURRENTLY JUNIOR FACULTY OR POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS WITH A PENDING  FACULTY APPOINTMENT) WHO WILL ENGAGE IN AN INDIVIDUALIZED CURRICULUM AND IN MENTORED HEALTH CARE  RESEARCH DURING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD IN THIS MULTIDISCIPLINARY, MULTICULTURAL K12 PROGRAM. 2) ENHANCE THE MENTORING ENVIRONMENT FOR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH SCHOLARS THROUGH A ROBUST PROGRAM FOR  BOTH MENTORS AND MENTEES BUILT ON THE NRMN TRAINING PLATFORM. 3) PROVIDE A HIGHLY FOCUSED MENTORED RESEARCH EXPERIENCE THAT FOSTERS SCHOLARS' SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO  INDEPENDENCE AND CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS LEADERS OF TRANSLATIONAL HEALTH CARE TEAMS. MEETING THESE OBJECTIVES WILL REQUIRE CONTINUED CAMPUS-WIDE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY PARTICIPATION OF FACULTY AS MEMBERS OF MENTORING TEAMS FOR K12 SCHOLARS.

SINCE ITS FOUNDING IN 2008, THE HARVARD CATALYST KL2 PROGRAM HAS SERVED AS THE CORNERSTONE ACROSS HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL (HMS) AND ITS AFFILIATED ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS FOR TRAINING OUR MOST OUTSTANDING EARLY-STAGE CT INVESTIGATORS. GIVEN THE DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS OF THE KL2 PROGRAM SINCE 2008, THE NEW K12 PROGRAM WILL BUILD ON THE KL2 PROGRAM'S STRENGTHS. THE NEW K12 PROGRAM WILL SPECIFICALLY SEEK TO HELP TRAIN AND DEVELOP THE FUTURE LEADERS OF CT SCIENCE BY LEVERAGING THE HARVARD CATALYST CORES AND INTEGRATING THE SCHOLARS INTO THE BROADER CT INFRASTRUCTURE AT HARVARD CATALYST AND THE CTSA CONSORTIUM. IN ADDITION, THROUGH DEDICATED FUNDING FROM THE HMS-AFFILIATED AMCS, THE K12 PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE PAIRED WITH THE CATALYST MEDICAL RESEARCH INVESTIGATOR (CMERIT) PROGRAM TO FURTHER ENRICH THE K12 LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. MOREOVER, THROUGH THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND EXPANSION OF THE CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH ACADEMY, A SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURAL ELEMENT OF HARVARD CATALYST, THE K12 WILL CREATE A COMMUNITY FOR CT INVESTIGATORS AND ENHANCE THE TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE FOR ALL K AWARDEES ACROSS HMS. FINALLY, THE K12 PROGRAM WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE HARVARD CATALYST CORES AND OTHER NIH-FUNDED PROGRAMS AT HMS TO ENHANCE THE RESEARCH CAPABILITY, COMPETENCY AND PERFORMANCE OF ALL K12 AWARDEES WITH A NEW FOCUS ON TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE. THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ENSURE AND NURTURE THE SUSTAINABLE CAREERS OF EARLY-STAGE CT INVESTIGATORS AND ULTIMATELY ADVANCE TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE. THE K12 PROGRAM WILL OFFER SUSTAINED PROTECTED TIME FOR SCHOLARS TO ADVANCE THEIR CT RESEARCH, OVERSEEN BY A PRIMARY MENTOR AND CO-MENTOR AND NOW FURTHER ENHANCED BY A DEDICATED MENTORSHIP COMMITTEE, INCLUDING A SEPARATE CAREER MENTOR TO PROVIDE OUTSIDE INPUT ON BROADER CAREER GOALS. TRAINING WILL INCLUDE THE USE OF NEW COURSES AND PROGRAMS, INCLUDING OUR MONTHLY TRANSLATE TOGETHER CURRICULUM, THAT COVERS THE BROAD TRANSLATIONAL SPECTRUM AND FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH.

THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE TRANSLATOR PROGRAM IS TO BUILD A SYSTEM TO CARRY OUT DIVERSIFIED AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC QUERIES ON AN INTEGRATED, SCALABLE, CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED KNOWLEDGE BASE.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE ARGUE THAT A SUCCESSFUL TRANSLATOR ARCHITECTURE BUILDS UPON A DISTRIBUTED API ECOSYSTEM FROM KNOWLEDGE PROVIDERS. IN THIS DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE, EACH KS PROVIDES AN API AS THE ONLY INTERFACE FOR ITS DOWNSTREAM CONSUMERS. EACH API WILL BE MAINTAINED INDIVIDUALLY SO THAT THE BURDEN WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AS WELL.

ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH IS TO FORCE ALL KS TO IMPLEMENT APIS WITH ONE STANDARD, BUT THAT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IMPLEMENTATION AND ON-GOING MAINTENANCE BURDENS. SOMETIMES, REIMPLEMENTING AN API IS NOT EVEN POSSIBLE (E.G. A KS API FROM AN OUTSIDE GROUP).

THE ARAGORN SERVICES REPRESENT THE NEXT GENERATION OF ROBOKOP COMPONENT SERVICES, ITERATING AND INNOVATING IN RESPONSE TO CHALLENGES EXPOSED IN THE TRANSLATOR FEASIBILITY PHASE. BASED ON THAT WORK, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED OVERARCHING ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED TO TRULY UNLEASH THE POWER OF TRANSLATOR. 1. ARAS MUST BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN A FEDERATED KNOWLEDGE ENVIRONMENT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. FIRST-GENERATION TRANSLATOR TOOLS ASSEMBLED FULL DATA SETS FROM WHICH TO EXTRACT ANSWERS, WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY RANKED. SECOND-GENERATION TOOLS MUST BE ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY OPERATE ON MASSIVE, DISTRIBUTED DATA, DEMANDING A NEW APPROACH. ARAGORN WILL ACT ASYNCHRONOUSLY, INTERLEAVING KP QUERIES WITH PARTIAL SCORING OF ANSWERS, PRIORITIZING SEARCH DIRECTIONS ON-THE-FLY, AND DELIVERING EARLY RESULTS THAT ARE UPDATED OVER TIME IN RESPONSE TO NEWLY EXPLORED PATHS 2. ARAS MUST BRIDGE THE PRECISION MISMATCH BETWEEN DATA REPRESENTATIONS AND ALGORITHMS THAT REQUIRE SPECIFICITY, AND USERS WHO POSE QUESTIONS AND PREFER ANSWERS AT A MORE ABSTRACT LEVEL. BIOMEDICAL SCIENTISTS DO NOT POSE QUESTIONS AS DATABASE QUERIES. FURTHERMORE, EVEN EXPERT USERS OF CURRENT BIOMEDICAL DATABASES SUCH AS ROBOKOP KG OR RTX REQUIRE EXPLORATION AND EXPERIMENTATION TO CRAFT QUERIES TO EXPRESS THEIR INTENT. ARAGORN WILL EMPLOY MULTIPLE STRATEGIES TO REMOVE THIS BARRIER TO ASKING QUESTIONS EFFECTIVELY, FROM BASIC MAINTENANCE OF A QUESTION LIBRARY, TO NODE GENERALIZATION, QUERY REWRITING, AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS CAPSULE GRAPH NETWORKS. ARAGORN WILL FURTHER USE ELEMENTS OF SPECIFIC ANSWERS TO CREATE GESTALT EXPLANATIONS, CLUSTERING, AND COMBINING ANSWERS WITH SIMILAR CONTENT, REVEALING THE COMMONALITIES AND CONTRADICTIONS IN ANSWERS. 3. ARAS MUST BE ABLE TO GENERALIZE ANSWER RANKING TO ADDRESS A BROADER RANGE OF QUESTION FORMULATIONS AND DATA TYPES, AND TO ACCOUNT FOR COUNTEREVIDENCE. IN THE TRANSLATOR IMPLEMENTATION PHASE, WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ACCESS TO MANY VARIED KPS AND ARAS THAT PROVIDE DIVERSE QUANTITATIVE METADATA REGARDING THE CONFIDENCE IN ASSERTIONS OR STRENGTH OF ASSOCIATIONS. THERE WILL BE A PRESSING NEED TO SYNTHESIZE SUCH DATA INTO SCORES FOR ARBITRARILY-SHAPED ANSWER GRAPHS, IN ORDER TO FILTER AND PRIORITIZE ANSWERS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS OR USER DIGESTION. ARAGORN WILL ADDRESS THIS NEED BY PROVIDING A NOVEL SCORING ALGORITHM CAPABLE OF (A) SCORING ARBITRARY DIRECTED MULTI-HYPERGRAPHS, (B) ACCOUNTING FOR HETEROGENEOUS QUANTITATIVE METADATA; AND (C) LEVERAGING RELATIONSHIP POLARITY TO INCORPORATE COUNTEREVIDENCE. ARAGORN WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO THIS FUNCTIONALITY, AND CONNECT TO KPS USING COMMUNITY-DEFINED APIS AND DATA MODELS. THE ARAGORN TEAM HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THESE COMMUNITY EFFORTS DURING THE TRANSLATOR FEASIBILITY PHASE, AND IF FUNDED WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STANDARDS AND REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS (SRI) GROUP, NCATS STAFF, AND OTHER AWARDEES TO CONTINUE TO DEFINE AND REFINE METHODS AND MODELS FOR DATA SHARING AND COLLABORATION.

WE PROPOSE A BIOMEDICAL DATA TRANSLATOR KNOWLEDGE PROVIDER FOR SYSTEMS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY TO ADDRESS THIS NEED. CENTRALLY, THE PROMISE OF SYSTEMS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY (SCB) IS DISCOVERING NOVEL THERAPEUTICS AND RE-PURPOSING OPPORTUNITIES, AVOIDING TOXICITY AND OTHER SIDE EFFECTS, AND UNDERSTANDING HOW SMALL MOLECULES FUNCTION (I.E., MECHANISM-OF-ACTION STUDIES). MANY EVIDENCE TYPES USED TO SOLVE SUCH PROBLEMS CAN ALSO BE USED TO UNDERSTAND FUNCTIONS OF ALTERATIONS AT SIMILAR MOLECULAR SCALES, SUCH AS POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION AND PROTEIN-CODING GENETIC VARIANTS. CURRENTLY, RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD FACE MAJOR DATA ACCESS AND INTERPRETATION CHALLENGES. FOR EXAMPLE, TO SUPPORT MECHANISM-OF-ACTION (MOA) STUDIES, MANY EXPERIMENTAL METHODS PRODUCE RELEVANT DATA (GENE-EXPRESSION, PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS, DIVERSE BIOACTIVITIES AGAINST PURE PROTEINS AND CELLS, ETC.) THAT ARE TOO NUMEROUS AND HETEROGENEOUS TO QUERY FOR MOST RESEARCHERS. MANY WEB-BASED TOOLS EXIST TO SHARE SUCH DATA, BUT THEY ARE SCATTERED, NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND, AND GENERALLY LACK ANY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EACH OTHER. AS THE FIELD MATURES AND INCREASINGLY EMBRACES HIGH-THROUGHPUT EXPERIMENTS, THESE PROBLEMS WILL ONLY GET WORSE (3). OUR PROPOSED SCB KNOWLEDGE PROVIDER WILL MITIGATE THESE CHALLENGES BY: - INTEGRATING AND RECONCILING CORE MOLECULAR DATA (STRUCTURE, NAME, ANNOTATED TARGET) FROM MULTIPLE EXISTING RESOURCES; - INTEGRATING AND ANALYZING BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY DATA FOR SMALL MOLECULES ACROSS MULTIPLE BIOLOGICAL SCALES (BINDING, CELLULAR ACTIVITY, DISEASE INDICATION) (4); AND - PROVIDING CONTEXT FOR ACTIVITIES OF SMALL MOLECULES AND THEIR TARGETS INFORMED BY SYSTEMS BIOLOGY (COMPLEXES, PATHWAYS, PROCESSES). OUR PROPOSED SCB KNOWLEDGE PROVIDER WILL ENABLE ANSWERING QUESTIONS SUCH AS: - WHAT IS THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF A SMALL MOLECULE IDENTIFIED FROM A PHENOTYPIC SCREEN? - WHICH COMPOUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO MODULATE MY TARGET OF INTEREST, AND WHICH OTHER CANDIDATE TARGETS MIGHT INFLUENCE THE ACTIVITY OF MY TARGET IN A PARTICULAR CELLULAR CONTEXT? - GIVEN MY INTEREST IN A DISEASE PROCESS OR PATHWAY, WHICH CANDIDATE TARGETS SHOULD I CONSIDER IN RELEVANT MODELS, AND WHICH COMPOUNDS ARE KNOWN TO MODULATE THOSE TARGETS? WE ANTICIPATE ADDRESSING GAPS IN DATA BY SCOUTING FOR INCLUSION ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF SMALL-MOLECULE BIOACTIVITY AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION ABOUT PROTEIN TARGET FUNCTION (SEE DATA MILESTONES).

FINALLY, WE PROPOSE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO HELP PRIORITIZE CONTENT MOST RELEVANT TO RESEARCHERS, OVERCOME DEVELOPMENT OBSTACLES, AND KEEP ABREAST OF EMERGING DATA AND METHODS (SEE OUTREACH MILESTONES). WE HAVE CORE EXPERTISE NEEDED TO REALIZE THIS SCB VISION VIA 15+ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH SMALL-MOLECULE BIOACTIVITY DATABASES AND PORTALS (5-7), PLUS EXPERTISE IN PHENOTYPIC SCREENING, SMALL-MOLECULE PROFILING, AND MOA STUDIES (8-10), WHICH DEMAND INTEGRATED UNDERSTANDING OF DIVERSE DATA FOR HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN SCIENCE.

THE CAPABILITY TO BRING TOGETHER DIFFERENT BIOMEDICAL DATA KNOWLEDGE SOURCES, INCLUDING EXPERIMENTAL DATA, IN ORDER TO DISCOVER YET UNKNOWN RELATIONSHIPS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO REALIZE.

PLAN : DOC SHERLOCK WILL USE THE ADVANCED LOGIC PROGRAMMING ENGINE MINIKANREN [2,3] , AND IT WILL USE PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE RULES TO TACKLE QUERIES INSPIRED BY PHYSICIAN-SCIENTISTS AND RANK RESULTS BY CONFIDENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE IMAGINE DOC SHERLOCK ANSWERING THE QUESTION, \u201cWHAT MAY TREAT 16P11.2 DELETION SYNDROME?\u201d BY USING A KP BACKED BY SOMETHING LIKE ENSEMBL [4] TO LOOK UP ALL THE GENES IN 16P11.2; A SECOND KP BACKED BY A DATASET LIKE GNOMAD [5,6] TO RANK HAPLOINSUFFICIENT GENES, E.G., \u201cKCTD13 IS HAPLOINSUFFICIENT\u201d [97% CONFIDENCE]; A GENE-GENE KP LIKE SEMMEDDB [7] TO FIND A RELATIONSHIP LIKE \u201cKCTD13 INHIBITS RHOA\u201d [97% CONFIDENCE] AND THEN USING A DRUG-GENE KP TO FIND THAT \u201cSIMVASTATIN INHIBITS RHOA\u201d [99% CONFIDENCE] TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT \u201cSIMVASTATIN MAY MITIGATE 16P11.2 DELETION VIA RHOA INHIBITION\u201d [93% IMPUTED CONFIDENCE]. TO ANSWER QUERIES FROM PHYSICIAN-SCIENTISTS, DATA SOURCES WHICH HAVE GENE-GENE, DRUG-GENE, DISEASE-GENE OR DRUG-DISEASE RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE HIGH PRIORITY. COLLABORATION : BUILDING ON OUR COLLABORATION MODEL FROM THE CURRENT TRANSLATOR PHASE, WE PLAN TO VISIT OTHER SITES AND HAVE THEM VISIT US TO WORK ON PROBLEMS FROM PHYSICIAN-SCIENTISTS. WE WILL SUPPORT THE ARA STANDARD API, AND OTHER TRANSLATOR STANDARDS. FOR QUERIES RICHER THAN THE DESIGNATED API, WE WILL SUPPORT PROGRAMMATIC ACCESS TO DOC SHERLOCK\u2019S QUERY LANGUAGE.

WHILE MANY EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES EXIST TO INTERROGATE MOLECULAR OR CELLULAR PROCESSES, FEW CAN DISCERN WHICH AMONG A HOST OF POTENTIAL ABNORMALITIES ARE RELEVANT TO DISEASE IN THE HUMAN SYSTEM. GENETIC VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE ARE UNIQUE IN PROVIDING MOLECULAR ALTERATIONS CAUSALLY RELATED TO HUMAN DISEASE RISK. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS. RARE DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS CAN (USUALLY) BE CLEARLY LINKED TO A GENE AND ARE WELL REPRESENTED BY CATALOGS SUCH AS CLINVAR, OMIM, AND MONARCH. COMPLEX DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS ARE HARDER TO INTERPRET BECAUSE THEY (A) ARE STATISTICAL RATHER THAN QUALITATIVE AND (B) USUALLY LIE IN NONCODING GENOMIC REGIONS THAT CANNOT BE IMMEDIATELY TRANSLATED TO MOLECULAR OR CELLULAR ABNORMALITIES. MANY COMPLEMENTARY RESOURCES TO HELP IN THE BIOLOGICAL TRANSLATION OF COMPLEX DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS HAVE RECENTLY EMERGED, BROADLY CLASSIFIABLE AS EITHER \u201cFUNCTIONAL GENOMIC\u201d DATASETS (E.G. FROM EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OR CHROMATIN CAPTURE) OR PREDICTIVE BIOINFORMATIC METHODS (E.G. THAT INTEGRATE VARIOUS GENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC DATASETS TO PREDICT DISEASE-SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES OR PATHWAYS). THESE RESOURCES REQUIRE EXPERTISE TO CURATE AND INTERPRET, AND THERE IS AS YET NO KNOWLEDGE SOURCE THAT INTEGRATES THEM TO INTERPRET COMPLEX DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS. FURTHERMORE, TECHNIQUES FOR HARMONIZING HETEROGENEOUS FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC DATASETS WITH RESPECT TO ONE ANOTHER ARE NOT YET ESTABLISHED, MOST PREDICTIVE BIOINFORMATIC METHODS SPECIFY COMPLEX DATA-PROCESSING PIPELINES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN SCALED TO RUN ACROSS MANY DISEASES, AND THERE ARE FEW IF ANY \u201cGOLD STANDARDS\u201d TO EVALUATE THE MOLECULAR OR CELLULAR ABNORMALITIES IDENTIFIED BY THESE RESOURCES. THE GOAL OF OUR PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS WITHIN A COMPLEX DISEASE GENETICS KNOWLEDGE PROVIDER FOR TRANSLATOR. WE ARE EXPERTS IN COMPLEX DISEASE GENETICS AND MAINTAIN THE KNOWLEDGE PORTAL NETWORK (KPN), A COLLECTION OF OPEN SOURCE WEB PORTALS AND SMART APIS THAT MAKE INTEGRATED GENETIC AND GENOMIC DATASETS PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE FOR >180 COMPLEX DISEASES. WE HAVE BUILT THE KPN BY DEVELOPING A PROTOCOL FOR WORKING WITH DISEASE EXPERTS TO AGGREGATE AND CURATE HIGH-CONFIDENCE GENETIC DATASETS, BUILDING COMPUTATIONAL PIPELINES TO HARMONIZE THESE DATA AND APPLY PREDICTIVE BIOINFORMATIC METHODS UPON THEM, AND EXTRACTING RELATIONSHIPS MINED FROM THESE DATA INTO A NEO4J GRAPH DATABASE. WE PROPOSE TO USE THE KPN AS A FOUNDATION TO IMPLEMENT A TRANSLATOR KNOWLEDGE PROVIDER OF HIGH-CONFIDENCE COMPLEX DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS AND PREDICTED DISEASE-RELEVANT MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ABNORMALITIES. WE WILL IMPLEMENT THIS KNOWLEDGE PROVIDER BY (A) EXPANDING THE DATA SOURCES, DATA TYPES, AND BIOINFORMATIC METHODS INTEGRATED WITHIN THE KPN; (B) DEVELOPING NEW COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHMS TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF GENETIC DATA TO IDENTIFY MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ABNORMALITIES UNDERLYING COMPLEX DISEASE; (C) MAINTAINING REST SERVICES PROVISIONING TRANSLATOR WITH THESE RESOURCES; AND (D) DEVELOPING METHODOLOGIES FOR EVALUATING THE ACCURACY AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OF THESE DATA, FURTHER CURATING THEM, AND DEFINING USE CASES OF THEM WITHIN TRANSLATOR. IN SO DOING, WE WILL ENABLE TRANSLATOR USERS TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS SUCH AS: - WHAT GENES ARE CAUSALLY LINKED TO COMPLEX DISEASE [X], AND WITH WHAT CONFIDENCE? - WHAT IS THE INCREASE IN RISK FOR COMPLEX DISEASE [X] WHEN GENE [Y] IS PERTURBED? - WHAT PATHWAYS ARE ENRICHED FOR ASSOCIATIONS WITH COMPLEX DISEASE [X]? - WHAT TISSUES MEDIATE THE PATHOGENESIS OF COMPLEX DISEASE [X]? - WHAT OTHER DISEASES ARE GENETICALLY CORRELATED WITH COMPLEX DISEASE [X]?

WE HAVE VALIDATED ICEES AND DEMONSTRATED THE SERVICE\u2019S ABILITY TO REPLICATE AND EXTEND PUBLISHED FINDINGS ON ASTHMA, WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING OPEN TEAM SCIENCE, ACCELERATED TRANSLATIONAL DISCOVERY, AND INTEGRATION WITH THE BROADER TRANSLATOR ECOSYSTEM. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO MOVE ICEES FROM PROTOTYPE TO DEVELOPMENT VIA CREATION OF AN ICEES+ KNOWLEDGE PROVIDER (KP). SPECIFICALLY, WE AIM TO ADDRESS THREE MAJOR CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) OF THE PROTOTYPE ICEES IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY, VALUE, AND IMPACT OF QUERY ANSWERS AND ASSERTIONS. SPECIFIC AIM 1. ADVANCE THE RIGOR OF INSIGHTS AND ASSERTIONS THAT ICEES PROVIDES. OUR PROTOTYPE ICEES CURRENTLY PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO DYNAMICALLY DEFINE COHORTS AND CONDUCT SIMPLE STATISTICAL ASSOCIATIONS TO EXAMINE BIVARIATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FEATURE VARIABLES. RECENTLY, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AN APPROACH TO EXTEND THE BIVARIATE FUNCTIONALITIES TO SUPPORT MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA. FOR THE PROPOSED WORK, WE WILL APPLY MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS (E.G., REGRESSION MODELS) AND MACHINE LEARNING METHODS (E.G., BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORK MODELS, VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER MODELS), AND SYSTEMATICALLY QUANTIFY THE EXTENT OF DATA LOSS AND ANALYTIC BOUNDS WHEN ALGORITHMS ARE IMPOSED ON THE ICEES+ KP OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API) VERSUS THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB)\u2013 PROTECTED, FULLY IDENTIFIED, PRE-BINNED, UNDERLYING INTEGRATED FEATURE TABLES. THE OVERALL GOAL IS TO PROVIDE USERS WITH MORE RIGOROUS INSIGHTS AND ESTIMATES OF THE ROBUSTNESS, VALIDITY, ACCURACY, AND SPECIFICITY OF KNOWLEDGE AND ASSERTIONS GENERATED VIA THE ICEES+ KP OPENAPI. SPECIFIC AIM 2. ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO SPACE\u2013TIME AND CAUSALITY. CLINICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATA ARE INHERENTLY SPATIOTEMPORAL, WITH OBSERVATIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE CONTINGENT ON SPACE AND TIME AND MAY BE CAUSALLY RELATED. FOR THE PROPOSED WORK, WE WILL EVALUATE AND IMPLEMENT TECHNICAL APPROACHES (E.G., ICEES+ DESIGN MODIFICATIONS), SPATIOTEMPORAL STATISTICAL ALGORITHMS (E.G., CONDITIONAL AUTO-REGRESSION), RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK MODELS, AND CAUSAL INFERENCE MODELS. AS PART OF THIS EFFORT, WE WILL DERIVE INSIGHTS FROM AND CONTRIBUTE REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CAUSAL ACTIVITY MODELS AND ADVERSE OUTCOME PATHWAYS. WE ALSO WILL EXPLORE APPROACHES FOR INCORPORATING INTO ICEES+ NATIONWIDE PUBLIC DATA ON SCHOOL EXPOSURES\u2014DATA THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS PATIENT MOBILITY. SPECIFIC AIM 3. EVALUATE THE SECURITY OF THE ICEES+ KP TO ENSURE THAT PATIENT PRIVACY IS PRESERVED AS NEW CAPABILITIES ARE ENABLED. IMPACT IS AN NSF-FUNDED PACKAGE OF TOOLS AND SERVICES THAT PROVIDES END-TO-END INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT FOR PRIVACY-ASSURED RESEARCH AND COMPUTATION ON SENSITIVE DATA. OVER THE AWARD PERIOD, WE WILL IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE IMPACT SECURITY PROTOCOLS, FOCUSING INITIALLY ON APPLICATION OF THE IMPACT SECURE MULTIPARTY COMPUTATION (SMC) ALGORITHM AS A METHOD TO SUPPORT SECURE MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL SHARING OF DATA ON RARE DISEASES AND EVENTS\u2014A FUNCTIONALITY THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED BY ICEES. IN ADDITION, WE WILL EVALUATE OTHER IMPACT SECURITY PROTOCOLS, WORKING UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A SECURITY ADVISOR AND IN THE CONTEXT OF DRIVING USE CASES AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPED UNDER SPECIFIC AIMS1 AND 2.

TEAM X-RAY WAS HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE IN TRANSLATOR'S FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT PHASE AND THE TEAM BRINGS CRITICAL EXPERTISE TO TRANSLATOR (SEE RESOURCES). COMPONENT TYPE: WE PROPOSE TO CREATE, VALIDATE, AND INTEGRATE AN AUTONOMOUS RELAY AGENT (ARA) CALLED ARAX . ARAX WILL BE A MIDDLEWARE COMPONENT IN THE NEW TRANSLATOR ARCHITECTURE THAT WILL EXTEND SIGNIFICANTLY BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE PROTOTYPE REASONING TOOL (RTX) THAT WE CREATED IN THE FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT PHASE. DEPENDING ON THE INPUT REQUEST, ARAX'S MAIN OUTPUT WILL BE RANKED SUBGRAPHS WITH CLEARLY EXPLAINED RANKING BASIS. ARAX WILL LEVERAGE CODE AND ALGORITHMS FROM RTX AND WILL HAVE AN EXPLICIT APPLICATION FOCUS AREA, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. MAIN PROBLEMS THAT ARAX IS TRYING TO ADDRESS: CONNECTIONS WITHIN A BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH HAVE HIGHLY VARIABLE DEGREES OF (I) CONFIDENCE (DUE TO AMBIGUOUS PREDICATES AND/OR DUE TO HIGHLY VARIABLE DEGREES OF RELIABILITY OF KNOWLEDGE TYPES) AND (II) POTENTIAL RELEVANCE TO THE USER'S QUERY. SUCH EDGE-SIGNIFICANCE VARIABILITY LEADS TO BOTH INCORRECT AND DIFFICULT-TO-INTERPRET RESULTS WHICH TOGETHER POSE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR CREATING BROADLY USEFUL TOOLS FOR COMPUTER-BASED BIOMEDICAL REASONING. WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY EXPLICITLY ACCOUNTING FOR THESE TWO TYPES OF EDGE VARIABILITY IN THE REASONING ALGORITHMS\u2013SPANNING A BROAD RANGE OF BIOMEDICAL QUERY TYPES\u2013THAT ARAX WILL PROVIDE TO TRANSLATOR. IN ADDITION TO THESE BROAD CAPABILITIES, AS DESCRIBED IN THE PROJECT PLAN, WE WILL INCORPORATE ADVANCED ALGORITHMS IN ARAX FOR RESPONDING TO QUERIES RELATING TO DISEASE THERAPY, INCLUDING (1) DRUG REPOSITIONING FOR KNOWN DISEASE, LEVERAGING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DISEASE\u2019S PATHOGENESIS [1] ; AND (2) THERAPEUTIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RARE DISEASES BASED ON SYMPTOMS AND THE PUTATIVE CAUSAL GENETIC VARIANT. PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT: IN OUR PROJECT PLAN WE DESCRIBE A FIVE-YEAR TIMELINE FOR CREATING, VALIDATING, AND INTEGRATING ARAX WITHIN TRANSLATOR, BEGINNING WITH A THREE-MONTH SPRINT LEADING TO A PROTOTYPE OF ARAX BY MID-MARCH 2020. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN INCLUDE: (1) LEVERAGING THE BIOTHINGS EXPLORER SOFTWARE FRAMEWORK TO ENABLE ARAX TO DYNAMICALLY MAP BETWEEN COMPOUNDS, PROTEINS, PATHWAYS, VARIANTS, PHENOTYPES, AND DISEASES BASED ON KNOWLEDGE SOURCE APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES IN THE TRANSLATOR REGISTRY; (2) LEVERAGING COHD AND RELATED TRANSLATOR RESOURCES TO OBTAIN BIOMEDICAL SEMANTIC DISTANCE INFORMATION; (3) LEVERAGING AN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE ENDPOINT FOR THE RTX BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH, KG2; AND (4) IMPLEMENTING PROBABILISTIC REASONING ALGORITHMS LEVERAGING PROVENANCE INFORMATION AND DYNAMICALLY DETERMINED EDGE RELEVANCE SCORES TO IMPROVE REASONING. WE WILL SYSTEMATICALLY USE MACHINE-LEARNING TO ALIGN RANKING SCORES WITH MEASURES OF OUTPUT QUALITY. COLLABORATION STRENGTHS OF OUR TEAM INCLUDE (I) DEVELOPING TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN TRANSLATOR SOFTWARE AGENTS (LEVERAGING PI DEUTSCH\u2019S EXTENSIVE PAST EXPERIENCE); (II) DEVELOPING KNOWLEDGE GRAPH STANDARDS (LEVERAGING PI RAMSEY\u2019S AND PI KOSLICKI\u2019S EXPERTISE); AND (III) DERIVING USE-CASE VIGNETTES THAT SPEAK TO THE TRANSFORMATIVE POTENTIAL OF TRANSLATOR (LEVERAGING CO-I ROACH\u2019S AND PI RAMSEY\u2019S EXPERTISE).

MOST DATA INTEGRATION EFFORTS (INCLUDING MANY BEING PURSUED WITHIN TRANSLATOR) ARE BASED ON BUILDING CENTRALIZED DATA RESOURCES. THESE EFFORTS TYPICALLY INVOLVE BUILDING RESOURCE-SPECIFIC DATA INGESTION PARSERS, THE OUTPUTS OF WHICH ARE ASSEMBLED INTO KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS AND LOADED INTO A LOCAL DATABASE (WITH NEO4J BEING A POPULAR OPTION WITHIN TRANSLATOR). THE BTE PLATFORM TAKES A COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH TO DATA INTEGRATION, FOCUSING ON A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK OF KNOWLEDGE PROVIDERS CONNECTED BY APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (APIS). A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT IMPLEMENTATION OF BTE IS NOW COMPLETE (WITH DEMOS AVAILABLE IN [1,2]). THIS IMPLEMENTATION HAS THREE COMPONENTS (FIGURE 1): A DISTRIBUTED KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (DISTRIBUTED-KG) BASED ON MANY INDIVIDUAL WEB APIS \"IN THE WILD\", A META-KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (META-KG) THAT DESCRIBES COMPATIBILITY OF INPUTS AND OUTPUTS BETWEEN EACH API, AND A BTE PYTHON CLIENT THAT AUTOMATES THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF QUERIES ACROSS THE API NETWORK. RELATIVE TO CENTRALIZED SOLUTIONS, THIS DISTRIBUTED MODEL OFFERS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES. FIRST, THE API ECOSYSTEM IS EASILY EXTENSIBLE BY THE COMMUNITY SINCE THERE IS NO GATEKEEPER CONTROLLING ACCESS TO A CENTRALIZED RESOURCE. THE SCOPE AND OUTPUT OF THE BTE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUOUSLY AND AUTOMATICALLY IMPROVE AS THE COMMUNITY-MAINTAINED REGISTRY OF API COMPONENTS CONTINUES TO GROW. SECOND, THE DATA RETRIEVED ARE ALWAYS UP-TO-DATE WITH THE SOURCE AND NOT DEPENDENT ON HAVING A FREQUENT SYNCHRONIZATION SCHEDULE. THIRD, THE DISTRIBUTED MODEL IS MORE SCALABLE TO HEAVY USAGE SINCE THE BTE CLIENT IS RUN ON EACH USER'S OWN COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE, BYPASSING ANY CENTRALIZED COMPONENT THAT COULD BECOME A SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE. BTE ALSO DISTINGUISHES ITSELF FROM OTHER FEDERATED API SOLUTIONS BY USING SEMANTICALLY-PRECISE ANNOTATIONS OF APIS AS THEY EXIST, RATHER THAN MANDATING ANY CHANGES TO THE API ITSELF. THESE API ANNOTATIONS DESCRIBE API INPUTS AND OUTPUTS IN ENOUGH DETAIL TO SUPPORT INITIATING THE API CALL AND INTERPRETING THE RESULT. IN CONTRAST, OTHER FEDERATED APPROACHES (INCLUDING SOME WITHIN TRANSLATOR) REQUIRE APIS TO CONFORM TO A COMMON API STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, REQUIREMENTS LIKE THESE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO WIDESPREAD ADOPTION, AND THIN API \"WRAPPERS\" AROUND NON-COMPLIANT APIS INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY AND TECHNICAL POINTS OF FAILURE. THE STRENGTHS OF THE CURRENT BTE IMPLEMENTATION ARE THE EASE OF ADDING NEW RESOURCES AND THE AUTOMATION OF THE QUERY PLANNING AND EXECUTION.

THE CLINIC HAS STARTED TO TREAT PATIENTS BASED ON BIOMARKERS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE GEFITINIB USED TO TREAT LUNG CANCER PATIENTS WITH MUTANT EGFR AND VEMURAFENIB USED TO TREAT MELANOMA PATIENTS WITH THE BRAF V600E MUTATION. CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE ALSO BEEN TAILORED TO RECRUIT PATIENTS WITH THE PRESENCE OF SPECIFIC BIOMARKERS. A VARIETY OF PRECLINICAL STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO DISCOVER BIOMARKERS OF INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS. RECENT LARGE-SCALE MOLECULAR PROFILING OF CELL LINES AND PHARMACOGENOMICS EVEN ENABLES THE PREDICTION OF BIOMARKERS IN SILICO. ALL THESE CONFIRMED OR INVESTIGATIONAL BIOMARKERS (IN SILICO, PRECLINICAL, IN CLINIC) HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS IN MODERN TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH. HOWEVER, OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BIOMARKERS IS SCATTERED AND LOCKED AWAY IN DIFFERENT PLACES, INCLUDING FDA LABELS, CLINICAL TRIAL DESCRIPTIONS, OR PUBLICATIONS, PRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO INTEGRATING THEM INTO KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS TO AUGMENT REASONING. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE TO CREATE A NOVEL COMPOSITE KNOWLEDGE SOURCE FOR BIOMARKER DISCOVERY. THIS NEW SOURCE WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DRUG-BIOMARKER-DISEASE-PATIENT AND SYNTHESIZE NEW KNOWLEDGE FOR PRECISION MEDICINE RESEARCH. TO COMPLY WITH ESTABLISHED STANDARDS AND AID THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DATA/SOFTWARE STANDARDS FOR TRANSLATOR, WE WILL FIRST DEVELOP AN ONTOLOGY TO DEFINE BIOMARKERS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER BIOMEDICAL ENTITIES. NEXT, WE WILL LEVERAGE STATE OF THE ART DEEP LEARNING METHODS TO EXTRACT BIOMARKERS FROM PUBLICATIONS AND CLINICAL TRIALS. WE WILL FURTHER ADOPT A CROWD-SOURCING APPROACH USING A LARGE POOL OF MEDICAL STUDENTS TO MANUALLY INSPECT AND CURATE BIOMARKERS PRIORITIZED BY OUR MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. THE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WILL BE ITERATIVELY IMPROVED THROUGH A SEMI-SUPERVISED APPROACH. TO ENSURE HIGH QUALITY OF PROVIDED KNOWLEDGE, MULTIPLE LINES (IN SILICO, PRECLINICAL, IN CLINIC) OF EVIDENCE ALONG WITH CONFIDENCE SCORES WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH EACH BIOMARKER. THROUGH COLLABORATING WITH NCATS STAFF, WE WILL LINK BIOMARKERS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO AUGMENT REASONING. WE EXPECT THAT THE RESOURCE WILL BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF A KNOWLEDGE GRAPH, ENABLING THE QUERY OF NOVEL QUESTIONS RELATED TO PRECISION MEDICINE AND THE BUILDING OF AI MODELS. FOR EXAMPLE, CAN DRUG X WORK IN A MOUSE MODEL Y WHERE GENE Z IS MUTATED? IN WHAT PATIENT POPULATION MAY DRUG X BE EFFECTIVE? CAN DRUG X BE REPURPOSED TO TREAT CONDITION M WHERE THE BIOMARKER OF DRUG X IS PRESENTED? CAN WE FIND NEW DRUGS/TARGETS FOR THOSE PATIENTS WITH THE ABSENCE OF THE BIOMARKER FOR THE APPROVED DRUG? MOREOVER, THE LABELED AND WELL-CURATED DATA ALONG WITH MOLECULAR PROFILES PROVIDE AI-READY RESOURCES FOR NOVEL BIOMARKER DISCOVERY THAT COULD BE FURTHER VALIDATED BY BENCH SCIENTISTS. TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL, WE HAVE ASSEMBLED AN OUTSTANDING TEAM COMPRISING EXPERTS IN BIOLOGY, INFORMATICS, MACHINE LEARNING, ONTOLOGY, AND KNOWLEDGE GRAPH. THROUGH TWO NIH-FUNDED BIOMARKER DISCOVERY PROJECTS, PI DR. CHEN HAS GAINED EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE IN BIOMARKER DISCOVERY, COLLECTED COMPELLING USE CASES WITH BENCH COLLABORATORS, AND BUILT A TOOL FOR PRECISION MEDICINE. CO-I DR. DUESBERY, A BIOLOGIST BY TRAINING AND DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT SPECTRUM HEALTH SYSTEM, WILL LEAD THE INSPECTION OF BIOMARKERS USING REAL-WORLD DATA. BY COMBINING EXPERTISE OF DR. KRISHNAN WHO HAS BUILT DEEP-LEARNING METHODS TO ANNOTATE DISEASE SAMPLES FROM FREE-TEXT, AND DR. DING WHO SPECIALIZES IN ONTOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND KNOWLEDGE GRAPH CONSTRUCTION AND MINING, THE TEAM IS WELL-POSITIONED TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT.

THE FNIH THEREFORE HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH BOTH NIH AND THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND DEEP FAMILIARITY WITH NIH\u2019S PEOPLE, SCIENCE, PRACTICES, AND POLICIES. THE FNIH HAS BEEN ASKED BY DR. FRANCIS S. COLLINS, DIRECTOR OF THE NIH, TO ASSIST THE AGENCY IN ITS RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS. THE AIM OF THIS COLLABORATION IS TO ACCELERATE NIH RESEARCH URGENTLY REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THIS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT AND TO SAVE LIVES BY LEVERAGING PRIVATE-SECTOR SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE, IN-KIND ASSETS AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO AUGMENT FEDERAL EFFORTS. DR. COLLINS\u2019 REQUEST THAT THE FNIH HELP CREATE A COVID-19 PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THERAPEUTICS AND VACCINES UNDER THE ACCELERATING MEDICINES PARTNERSHIP (AMP) IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FNIH\u2019S OWN MISSION AND THE CONGRESSIONAL STATUTE BY WHICH THE FNIH WAS ESTABLISHED TO SUPPORT THE NIH IN ITS MISSION AND TO ADVANCE COLLABORATION WITH BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS FROM UNIVERSITIES, INDUSTRY, NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE US FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA). AMP IS A NIMBLE AND POWERFUL PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT INCLUDES THE NIH, FNIH, FDA AND MULTIPLE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. MANAGED BY THE FNIH, AMP PROGRAMS BRING TOGETHER THE RESOURCES OF THE NIH AND INDUSTRY TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE PATHWAYS AND FACILITATE BETTER SELECTION OF TARGETS FOR TREATMENT. MULTIMILLION DOLLAR COLLABORATIONS SUPPORTED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR THROUGH THE FNIH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN FOUR MAJOR DISEASE AREAS: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, TYPE 2 DIABETES, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA)/LUPUS AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE. THE FNIH IS ALSO PREPARING TO LAUNCH AN AMP IN SCHIZOPHRENIA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH). THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE FNIH IN THIS NEW AMP IS TO SUPPORT THE NIH IN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING A STRATEGIC AND COORDINATED CROSS-SECTOR APPROACH TO END THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND TO MANAGE FUTURE SUCH THREATS. THIS PPP IS NOW KNOWN AS ACTIV, THE ACCELERATED COVID-19 THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION AND VACCINE PARTNERSHIP. NOTABLY, MOST AMP PROJECTS START WITH A DESIGN PHASE THAT TAKES APPROXIMATELY 9 MONTHS TO COMPLETE IN WHICH THE FNIH IDENTIFIES KEY PARTNERS, ESTABLISHES SCIENTIFIC WORKING AND SUB-GROUPS, PUTS IN PLACE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES, EXECUTES CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS, DEPLOYS AND TRAINS APPROPRIATE STAFF, AND IDENTIFIES POTENTIAL SOURCES OF FUNDING. THE RESULT OF THE DESIGN PHASE IS A DETAILED SCIENTIFIC AND BUSINESS PLAN FOR THE PPP, WHICH IS CALLED THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE WHITE PAPER). THE RESULTING IMPLEMENTATION PHASE IS A MULTIYEAR EFFORT IN WHICH THE PPP, THROUGH MANAGEMENT BY THE FNIH, OPERATIONALIZES THE SCIENTIFIC PLAN AND COORDINATES THIS WORK WITH CRITICAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY NIH USING ITS GRANTS AND CONTRACTS MECHANISMS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE ACUTE PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT THAT HAS RESULTED IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COVID-19 DEATHS, THE FNIH RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY TO NIH\u2019S CALL TO ACTION, REDIRECTING STAFF FROM ACTIVE, FULLY FUNDED DONOR-SUPPORTED PROGRAMS TO BEGIN WORK ON THE DESIGN PHASE FOR THE PROPOSED PPP EVEN THOUGH NO FINANCING FOR THE FNIH\u2019S WORK HAS YET BEEN SECURED.
