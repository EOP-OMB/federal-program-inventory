THE FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT (FSMA) PREVENTIVE CONTROLS FOR HUMAN FOOD (PCHF) SUBPART A (21 CFR 117.4) HAS SPECIFICATIONS FOR FOOD INDUSTRIES ON EMPLOYEE TRAINING. PREVIOUS RESEARCH SHOWED THAT SMALL-SCALE FOOD PROCESSORS HAVE UNIQUE BARRIERS TO FOOD SAFETY REGULATION COMPLIANCE, ALSO DEMONSTRATED THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING AUDIENCE-TARGETED FOOD SAFETY TRAINING TO ADDRESS THOSE BARRIERS. AFTER THE COVID PANDEMIC, HIGH TURN-OVER RATE MADE FOOD SAFETY TRAINING EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE PROCESSORS. LOW-COST VIRTUAL TRAINING IS PREFERRED BY MANY SMALL PROCESSORS, SINCE IT SAVES THEIR TRAVEL TIME AND ALLOWS THEM TO SELF-PACE THEIR LEARNING EXPERIENCE. TRADITIONAL VIRTUAL TRAINING IS OFTEN CRITICIZED FOR MISSING THE HANDS-ON COMPONENT, WHICH WAS AN ESSENTIAL SUCCESS FACTOR FOR EFFECTIVE FOOD SAFETY TRAINING. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL DEVELOP A TRANSFORMATIVE LEARNING PROGRAM (TLP) TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES. THE FIRST STEP (TLP 1.0 ) IS PROPOSED IN THIS PROJECT, WHICH IS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE VIRTUAL SIMULATION MODULES TO ENGAGE SMALL FOOD PROCESSORS AND TO BUILD THE FOOD SAFETY CULTURE IN THEIR BUSINESS. THE OBJECTIVES ARE (1) IDENTIFY MODULE CONTENT AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF SMALL-SCALE FOOD PROCESSORS USING THE DELPHI METHOD; (2) EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE VIRTUAL SIMULATION MODULES AND ASSESS BEHAVIOR-CHANGE VIA SURVEYS, GAME ANALYTICS, AND CASE STUDIES WITH OBSERVATIONS AND INTERVIEWS; AND (3) DEVELOP A TRAIN-THE-TRAINER COURSE AMONG EXTENSION EDUCATORS AND FOOD SAFETY PROFESSIONALS TO SUSTAIN THE IMPACT OF THE TLP.

THE COST TO THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS STARTLING - $15.6 MILLION ANNUALLY. THE FOOD SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACT (FSMA) WAS INITIATED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY DEVELOPING REGULATIONS AND TRAININGS THAT USE A PREVENTION APPROACH, RATHER THAN THE PREVIOUS REACTION APPROACH. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE NATIONAL PRIORITY OF FOOD SAFETY COMPLIANCE WHILE PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO LOW RESOURCE, LIMITED INCOME SMALL FARMERS, PROCESSORS AND EXISTING AND POTENTIAL PROCESSORS. THE NATIONAL TREND FOR LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD IS OFTEN UNMET. THIS COMMUNITY PROJECT BRINGS ALL THE FOOD SAFETY PLAYERS TOGETHER TO INITIATE DISCUSSIONS, DISCOVER UNMET NEEDS AND SHARE OPPORTUNITIES. THE RESULT WILL BE MORE LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD, CREATION OF JOBS, LOCAL ECONOMIC STIMULATION AND FOOD PRODUCED SAFELY. WE TARGET SMALL FARMERS, PROCESSORS, EXISTING AND POTENTIAL ENTREPRENEURS, ESPECIALLY LOW AND LIMITED RESOURCE MINORITIES. MOST AMONG THIS GROUP THAT DESIRE TO PROCESS FOOD DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL FOR THE REQUIRED COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT, LACK THE REQUIRED TRAINING NOR HAVE THE BUSINESS APTITUDE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. ANYONE THAT PROCESSES FOOD, INCLUDING CUTTING, BAGGING, MIXING, ETC. MUST BE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE REGULATIONS AND PRACTICE THE APPROPRIATE FOOD SAFETY STEPS. OFFERING THE APPROPRIATE FSMA TRAININGS WITH ONGOING BUSINESS SUPPORT ARE BOTH KEYS TO SUCCESS AND INCLUDED IN THIS PROJECT. THESE SAME AUDIENCES DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DEVELOP THEIR DESIRED PRODUCT IN APPROVED FACILITIES. WE WILL CONVERT AN EXISTING COMMERCIAL KITCHEN INTO A CULINARY INCUBATOR (CI), EQUIPPED WITH THE PROPER EQUIPMENT, CERTIFIED BY FOOD AUTHORITIES AND MANAGED BY A \"QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL\" THAT WILL SERVE AS A SHARED USE FACILITY TO DEVELOP FOOD PRODUCTS SAFELY. NATIONALLY, CI&#39;S HAVE INCREASED 50% AND PROFITS WITHIN INCREASED 82%. TO BE SUCCESSFUL ONE MUST PLAN SUCCESSFULLY; THE LACK OF BUSINESS PLANNING IS A COMMON REASON WHY SMALL ENTREPRENEURS DO NOT MAKE IT. THE NEEDED BUSINESS TRAINING, LICENSING ASSISTANCE, CONSULTING, PLANNING AND OFFICES TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WILL BE PROVIDED BY PARTNERING WITH THE LINCOLN UNIVERSITY SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER (SBDC). THIRTY PARTICIPANTS WILL TAKE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT TRAINING, BECOME CERTIFIED IN THE REQUIRED FSMA CLASSES AND WORK WITH THE BUSINESS CENTER TO TAKE THEIR PRODUCE FROM IDEA TO SALES. AFTER BEING SUCCESSFUL, WITHIN TWO YEARS, PARTICIPANTS ARE GRADUATED ALLOWING ROOM FOR NEW COMERS. REQUIRED FSMA TRAINING WILL BE TAUGHT BY NATIONAL EXPERTS. THE LUCI PARTICIPANTS, LU STUDENTS, SMALL FARMERS, PROCESSORS, ENTREPRENEURS AND INSPECTORS ARE FIRST INVITED. THEREAFTER, THE CLASSES WILL BE OPENED TO THE PUBLIC. FSMA CLASSES OFFERED WILL INCLUDE FOOD SAFETY PREVENTIVE CONTROL, GOOD MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND SPROUTS TRAINING. PARTICIPANTS WILL BECOME CERTIFIED TO MEET FSMA REGULATIONS. COLLABORATORS DR. SHAW, IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY AND DR. DENG, ILLINOIS INSTITUTE FOR FOOD SAFETY AND HEALTH WILL INSTRUCT THE FSMA CLASSES. ADDITIONAL FOOD SAFETY CLASSES AND WORKSHOPS WILL BE OFFERED AS NEEDS ARE IDENTIFIED. LOCAL FOOD SAFETY AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ARE INVITED TO PRESENT THEIR TOPICS AND CONTRIBUTE TO NEW TRAININGS THAT ARE DEVELOPED. LIKELY TOPICS SUCH AS CANNING, LABELING, DETERMINING NUTRITION, RECORD KEEPING, SAMPLES, ETC.. WILL BE OFFERED. PROGRAM EFFORTS ARE DELIVERED USING A VARIETY OF METHODS. INCLUDED ARE FORMAL CLASSES, WORKSHOPS, DEMONSTRATIONS, BOOTHS AND PARTICIPATION AT SPECIAL EVENTS AND NETWORKING. ACTIVELY INVOLVING THE COMMUNITY WILL BE KEY TO SUCCESS. WE STRIVE TO GET ALL THE FOOD SAFETY PLAYERS COMMUNICATING AND WORKING POSITIVELY TOGETHER. ASSISTING UPFRONT SERVES MUCH BETTER THAN BEING REACTIVE REGARDING INSPECTIONS, ETC. A STRONG COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT IS VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS. MANY PRODUCE FARMERS CAN INCREASE THEIR PROFITS BY PROCESSING SECOND RATE PRODUCE OR PRODUCE THEY CANNOT SELL (SUCH AS A BRUISED TOMATO) INTO A PROCESSED PRODUCT (SUCH AS SALSA) GIVEN ACCESS TO FACILITIES AND REQUIRED FOOD SAFETY KNOWLEDGE AND BUSINESS SUPPORT. VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS GREATLY REDUCE WASTE, CAN EXTEND GROWING SEASONS AND MAKE A PROFIT ON OTHERWISE UNSELLABLE PRODUCT. VALUE-ADDED CLASSES WILL BE OFFERED TO TEACH AND DEMONSTRATE HOW TO MAKE VALUE-ADDED PRODUCT AND THE FEASIBLY OF SUCH. LINCOLN UNIVERSITY AGRICULTURE AND AGRIBUSINESS STUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO ATTEND THE VALUE-ADDED TRAINING. THE FOOD TRUCK BUSINESS IS RAPIDLY GROWING, BUT MANY ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL. TARGETING FOOD TRUCKS CAN TEACH THESE SMALL LOW RESOURCE ENTREPRENEURS HOW TO BUY IN QUANTITY, MAKE FOOD IN BATCHES AND TURN A PROFIT USING THE LUCI FOR FOOD PREPARATION AND GAINING BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE THROUGH THE SBDC. PARTNERSHIPS WILL BE FORGED BY PROVIDING PROCESSORS WITH PRODUCERS CONTACT INFORMATION. EIGHT LOCAL FARMERS MARKETS WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO OFFER FOOD SAFETY DEMONSTRATIONS, INFORMATION AND INTERACTIONS WITH SPECIALISTS. FOOD SAFETY FOR FARMERS MARKETS WILL BE OFFERED AS A CLASS. SHORT INTERVIEWS WILL ACCESS INCREASES IN FOOD SAFETY KNOWLEDGE. A HAND WASHING STATION WILL BE PROVIDED TO A LOCAL FARMERS MARKET AND WILL BE EVALUATED FOR EFFECTIVENESS IN INCREASING AWARENESS OF FOOD SAFETY. USING A COMMUNITY BASED APPROACH ENSURES ALL THE PLAYERS ARE INVOLVED. A COMMUNITY COMMITTEE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REGULATORY BRANCHES, CONSUMERS, EDUCATORS, STUDENTS, SMALL FARMERS, PROCESSORS, ENTREPRENEURS AND OTHERS WILL NETWORK REGULARLY TO UPDATE AND ADVISE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. A NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL BE SENT TO THE TARGETED AUDIENCES TO DEVELOP AND ADDRESS REAL, NOT PERCEIVED NEEDS. ALL THESE GROUPS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TRAININGS, WORKSHOPS, EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES AS OFFERED. STUDENTS ARE OUR FUTURE FARMERS. TEN LINCOLN UNIVERSITY AGRICULTURE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE A STIPEND FOR ATTENDING THE FSMA CERTIFICATION CLASSES, WILL BE TAUGHT VALUE-ADDED FOOD PRODUCTION AND AT GRADUATION WILL TAKE FOOD SAFETY KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES TO THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY UPON EMPLOYMENT. OTHER STATE UNIVERSITIES ALREADY OFFER THESE WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE CURRICULUM. THE OPPORTUNITY TO GRADUATE WITH THESE CERTIFICATIONS WILL GIVE THE LU STUDENTS A COMPETITIVE EDGE AND ENSURE FOOD SAFETY KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES WILL FOLLOW THEM INTO EMPLOYMENT IN THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. A MAJOR PARTNER IS THE NORTH CENTRAL REGIONAL FSMA TRAINING CENTER. THEY WILL PROVIDE INPUT AT EVERY STEP OF THE PROJECT. ALL REPORTING WILL GO THROUGH THE CENTER.

COMPREHENSIVE APPROACHES TO FOOD SAFETY FOR SMALL DIVERSIFIED FARMS, INCLUDING THOSE EXEMPT BY FSMA STANDARDS, MUST BE ADDRESSED TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS AND ENSURE THE CONTINUED LIVELIHOOD OF OUR FARMERS.UP UNTIL NOW, TTCF HAS LACKED THE RESOURCES AND CAPACITY TO FULLY ADDRESS THE EVOLVING FOOD SAFETY NEEDS OF REFUGEE FARMERS&#39; BUSINESSES AND THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT (FSMA) THAT THEY NEED TO ADHERE TO. TTCF AND PARTICIPATING FARMERS ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN BOTH PRODUCTION AND MARKETING, PRESENTING NEW CHALLENGES AND GAPS IN CURRENT FOOD SAFETY KNOWLEDGE, PLANNING, AND PRACTICE. IN ADDITION, TTCF HAS EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF CSA MEMBERS RECEIVING PRODUCE FROM TTCF EACH YEAR FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS, MOVING TO YEAR-ROUND PRODUCTION AND MARKETING THROUGH A WINTER CSA OFFERING, GROWING FROM 25 MEMBERS AND ONE PICK-UP LOCATIONS TO 150 HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AT SEVEN PICK UP LOCATIONS. SINCE MARKETING BEGAN IN 2015 FARMERS HAVE SEEN A 932% INCREASE IN SALES. FARMERS IN THE TTCF PROGRAM ARE INTERESTED IN CONTINUING THIS GROWTH TREND BY ACCESSING LUCRATIVE NEW MARKETS, WHICH INCLUDE NEW RETAIL OUTLETS AND WHOLESALE AND INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE HIGHER FOOD SAFETY STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS. THE ULTIMATE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE FOOD SAFETY PLAN THAT WILL SUPPORT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF FARMERS&#39; BUSINESSES AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF CONSUMERS.TTCF STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS WILL USE THE FOLLOWING METHODS AND APPROACHES TO REACH THE LONG-TERM GOAL:YEAR 11) IDENTIFY EXISTING FOOD SAFETY PLAN TEMPLATES APPLICABLE FOR MODIFICATIONS NECESSARY TO MEET THE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS OF TTCF FARMERS. 2) WORK WITH COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND WHOLESALE PRODUCE PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC RISKS AND PROBLEM AREAS POSED BY PASTURED POULTRY, AGRITOURISM ACTIVITIES, WHOLESALE REGULATIONS, FARMERS SHARING PRE AND POSTHARVEST HANDLING INFRASTRUCTURE. 3) DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE FOOD SAFETY PLAN ENSURING THAT THE FINALIZED COMPREHENSIVE FOOD SAFETY PLAN IS BOTH CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THE TARGET FARMER AUDIENCE AS WELL AS FSMA COMPLIANT.YEAR 21) IMPLEMENT BI-MONTHLY FOOD SAFETY TRAININGS TO ALL 33 FARMERS ENROLLED IN THE TTCF INCUBATOR FARM PROGRAM. 2) BEGIN INCORPORATING FOOD SAFETY PROTOCOLS INTO ALL PRODUCTION, POST HARVEST HANDLING, PASTURED POULTRY AND AGRITOURISM ACTIVITIES. 3) ANALYZE ONGOING SURVEY DATA FROM FOOD SAFETY TRAININGS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE AND CREATE FINAL FOOD SAFETY PLAN. 4) FINALIZE FOOD SAFETY PLANS AND INTEGRATE INTO ONE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT ADDRESSES ALL RISK AREAS PRESENT AT THE TTCF FARM SITE. 5) ALL 33 FARMERS BEGIN INDEPENDENT IMPLEMENTATION OF FOOD SAFETY PROTOCOLS. TTCF STAFF AND PARTNERS IMPLEMENT MOCK AUDITS TO TEST FARMER COMPLIANCE. 6) TRAIN 3 ADVANCED FARMER LEADERS USING THE TOT TRAINING OF TRAINERS MODEL IN ORDER TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE AND CONTINUED TRAININGS BEYOND THE 2-YEAR GRANT TIMELINE. 7) STAKEHOLDERS DISSEMINATE FINALIZED FOOD SAFETY PLANS TO BE USED BY OTHER EDUCATORS AND FARMERS IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR.1.

THIS PROJECT WILL EXPAND FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT FARMERS IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION, WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF SUPPORTING THESE FARMERS IN ADOPTING FOOD SAFETY BEST-PRACTICES AND REDUCING THE OVERALL RISK OF FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAKS ORIGINATING FROM THEIR FARMS.REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT FARMERS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY NEED TO COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL FOOD-SAFETY REGULATIONS SUCH AS THE FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT (FSMA) IN ORDER TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS TO THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER, THEY ARE OFTEN NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE FULL RANGE OF FOOD SAFETY RELATED RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO OTHER FARMERS. THIS IS DUE TO LANGUAGE AND LITERACY BARRIERS, MINIMAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES, LACK OF ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE TRAINERS AND TRAINING EVENTS, AND INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNITED STATES&#39; FOOD SYSTEM REGULATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WHILE SPANISH TRANSLATIONS OF FOOD SAFETY TRAININGS AND TEMPLATES ARE OFTEN AVAILABLE, THERE ARE VERY FEW IF ANY MATERIALS AVAILABLE IN LESS COMMONLY SPOKEN LANGUAGES SUCH AS NEPALI, ARABIC, AND LU-MIEN. MANY OF THESE FARMERS LACK MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION, MAKING IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTEND FOOD SAFETY TRAININGS HELD OUTSIDE THEIR IMMEDIATE AREA. FARMERS BELONGING TO THESE GROUPS ARE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM ANY INTERNET-BASED TRAINING THAT IS AVAILABLE. BECAUSE MANY OF THESE FARMERS HAVE LITTLE OR NO FORMAL EDUCATION OR CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE, THERE IS A NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE CURRICULA AND DELIVERY METHODS. AS IRC HAS LEARNED FROM WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH REFUGEE FARMER GROUPS THROUGH ITS NATIONWIDE FARMER TRAINING PROGRAM, TRADITIONAL WESTERN AND FORMAL TEACHING STYLES ARE LESS EFFECTIVE FOR MANY OF THESE FARMERS THAN IN-PERSON, HANDS-ON, NON-FORMAL, AND HIGHLY VISUAL TEACHING STYLES.FOR THIS REASON, IRC IS FOCUSING ON VIDEO AND VISUAL-BASED TRAINING MODULES FOR THIS PROJECT. LASTLY, MANY OF THE FARMERS WHO WILL BE REACHED IN THE \"EXPANDED REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT FOOD SAFETY OUTREACH PROJECT IN SACRAMENTO\" ARE NON-LITERATE, FURTHER NECESSITATING ALTERNATIVE CURRICULA. WHILE MANY OF THE FARMERS HAVE EXTENSIVE FARMING EXPERIENCE IN THEIR COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN, FOOD SAFETY REGULATIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE OFTEN NON-EXISTENT OR MUCH LESS STRINGENT THAN IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, MANY OF THE REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT FARMERS WITHIN THIS PROJECT&#39;S TARGETED FARMER GROUPS DO NOT EXERCISE FOOD SAFETY BEST PRACTICES ON THEIR FARMS. THIS RESULTS IN A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAKS IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION AND BEYOND, AS WELL AS RISK TO THE FARMERS&#39; ENTERPRISES.WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THESE COMMUNITIES FACE, THE IRC WILL COMPLETE THREE SETS OF FOOD SAFETY TRAINING CURRICULA EACH CATERED TOWARDS A DIFFERENT AUDIENCE OF MARGINALIZED FARMERS, INCLUDING NEPALI, ARABIC AND LU-MIEN SPEAKERS. THE CURRICULUM WILL INCLUDE VIDEOS, VISUAL AIDS AND OTHER FORMS OF CONTENT THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL LEVELS OF LEARNERS TO TEACH THEM ABOUT THE FOOD SAFETY PRINCIPLES AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THEM. THE IRC WILL THEN SUPPORT THESE FARMERS TO UTILIZE THESE FOOD SAFETY BEST PRACTICES BY CREATING PLANS TO MONITOR AND TRACK THEIR ADOPTION OF THESE PRACTICES AND PROVIDE REGULAR VISITS AND MEETINGS TO FOSTER THE USE OF THESE PRACTICES ON THEIR FARMS. FINALLY THE IRC WILL SHARE THE EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL THAT IS CREATED AND THE RESULTS OF MONITORING THE ADOPTION OF THESE PRACTICES WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS NATIONWIDE THAT ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR ACTIVITIES TO INCREASE THE CATALOG OF AVAILABLE CONTENT. AS A RESULT OF THIS PROJECT, CULTURALLY SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA ON FOOD SAFETY WILL BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED WITH REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT FARMERS, FOOD SAFETY BEST PRACTICES WILL BE EMPLOYED ON THEIR FARMS AND THE OVERALL RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESSES FROM THEIR PRODUCE WILL BE REDUCED.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "68947e1e-ccf7-5356-c05c-7f2e21aa5111-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20197002030337_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 85400102, "Award ID": "20197002030336", "Award Amount": 149921.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-06", "CFDA Number": "10.328", "Description": "FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION FOR KOREAN SPEAKING SPECIALTY FRUIT GROWERS IN CALIFORNIA WILL INCREASE THE FOOD SAFETY PRACTICES OF APPROXIMATELY 50 KOREAN SPEAKING FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH MOSTLY FARM JUJUBES (ZIZYPHUS JUJUBA) IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, CA.

CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION, INCLUDING THE ELDERLY, CHILDREN, AND THOSE WITH WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEMS, ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO FOODBORNE PATHOGENS. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) ECONOMIC RESEARCH SERVICE (ERS) ESTIMATE THAT THE BURDEN OF THE FOODBORNE ILLNESSES TO THE CONSUMERS EXCEEDS $15 BILLION EACH YEAR. LIKEWISE, THE FOOD INDUSTRY TAKES A SUBSTANTIAL HIT WITH EACH FOOD SAFETY SCARE AND PRODUCT RECALL, BOTH IN ECONOMIC LOSSES AND DECREASED CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. EXTENSIVE RESEARCH IN RISK AND CRISIS COMMUNICATION NOTE THE EFFECTS OF NEGATIVE MEDIA COVERAGE OF FOOD SAFETY INCIDENTS AND THE CONTRIBUTION TO DECREASES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL ISSUE FOR CONSUMERS AND PRODUCERS, THE FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT (FSMA) LEGISLATION PLACES A STRONG EMPHASIS ON PREVENTION.AS CONSUMERS ARE ADVISED TO INCREASE THEIR CONSUMPTION OF HEALTHFUL FOODS, DEMAND FOR LEAFY GREENS SUCH AS ROMAINE LETTUCE AND SPINACH WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. THE CALIFORNIA LEAFY GREEN INDUSTRY IS VAST, WITH MORE THAN 1,700 FARMS SUPPLYING 72.3 % OF THE U.S. PRODUCE MARKET&#39;S LETTUCE AND SPINACH, AMONG OTHER PRODUCTS (CALIFORNIA LEAFY GREENS PRODUCTS HANDLER MARKETING AGREEMENT). LEAFY GREENS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO ISSUES OF FOOD SAFETY AS SHOWN BY RECENT OUTBREAKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FALL 2018 E. COLI OUTBREAK IN ROMAINE LETTUCE HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPLEXITIES OF FOOD SAFETY ISSUES SUCH AS FOODBORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAKS AND RECALLS. SUCH OUTBREAKS AFFECT CONSUMERS&#39; WELLBEING AND PERCEPTIONS, AS WELL AS FARMERS&#39; BOTTOM LINE AND BUSINESS REPUTATIONS. HOWEVER, IN THE SPACE OF NON-DIFFERENTIATED FOOD PRODUCTS SUCH AS LEAFY GREENS, THESE INCIDENTS ALSO AFFECT THE WIDER INDUSTRY, AS CONSUMERS TURN TO OTHER TYPES OF PRODUCTS TO AVOID THE INCIDENT, HENCE LEADING TO POTENTIAL NEGATIVE SPILLOVER EFFECTS FOR ALL LEAFY GREENS PRODUCERS. FINALLY, FOOD SAFETY EVENTS SUCH AS THESE ALSO AFFECT FOOD PROCESSORS WHO SOURCE LEAFY GREENS FROM AFFECTED FARMERS, WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS.GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE LEAFY GREENS&#39; PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA, OUR FOOD SAFETY OUTREACH PROJECT FOCUSES ON FARMERS OF LEAFY GREENS. WE FOCUS ON OPERATIONS IN THE SANTA MARIA VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA (SANTA BARBARA AND SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTIES), AND SPECIFICALLY WORK WITH SMALL AND VERY SMALL OPERATORS IN THIS REGION. TWO SIGNIFICANT FOOD SAFETY REGULATION COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST FOR VERY SMALL OPERATORS ARE UNDERSTANDING AND INTERPRETING REGULATIONS, AND DEVELOPING COST-EFFECTIVE PLANS TO COMPLY WITH MINIMIZING PRODUCT CONTAMINATION RISK. THESE CHALLENGES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PRONOUNCED FOR SMALL-SCALE FARM OPERATORS FROM UNDERSERVED BACKGROUNDS WHO MAY HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH-SPEAKING SKILLS, LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATION, AND OFTEN ARE OF HISPANIC BACKGROUND. GIVEN THE GREAT NEED OF SMALL AND VERY SMALL FARM OPERATORS OF HISPANIC ORIGIN IN CALIFORNIA FOR TRAINING AND ASSISTANCE IN COMPLYING WITH THE FSMA PRODUCE SAFETY RULE, WHILE ALSO REMAINING PROFITABLE IN THE INDUSTRY, THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON EFFORTS TO TRAIN AND ASSIST THIS SPECIFIC TARGET GROUP.THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT COMBINES THE AREAS OF FOOD SCIENCE, AGRIBUSINESS, AND AGRICULTURAL COMMUNICATION, AND CONSISTS OF THREE PARTS:PRODUCE SAFETY ALLIANCE GROWER TRAINING FOR SMALL FARM OPERATORS OF HISPANIC ORIGIN IN THE SANTA MARIA VALLEY, AND CAL POLY / ALLAN HANCOCK COLLEGE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTSIN-PERSON DAY-LONG FIELD VISITS TO 15 INDIVIDUAL FARMS IN SANTA MARIA VALLEY BY PERSONNEL FROM CAL POLY AND ALLAN HANCOCK COLLEGE (INCLUDING FOUR PROFESSORS AND MULTIPLE STUDENTS), TO TRAIN AND ASSIST FARMER PARTICIPANTS WITH:PRODUCE SAFETY RULE COMPLIANCE, AND FARM FOOD SAFETY PLAN DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND CONSULTINGMARKETING INITIATIVES RELATED TO FOOD SAFETY AND DATA COLLECTION TRAININGCRISIS COMMUNICATION AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PLAN DEVELOPMENTCAL POLY AND ALLAN HANCOCK COLLEGE STUDENTS WILL BE INTENSELY INVOLVED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE OUTREACH PROJECT OUTLINED ABOVE. WE WILL TRAIN THE STUDENTS USING CAL POLY&#39;S MODEL OF LEARN-BY-DOING, HENCE STUDENTS WILL BOTH BE TRAINED BY THE PROFESSORS, AND WILL ASSIST THE PROFESSORS IN TRAINING THE FARMERS. BY INVOLVING STUDENTS, WE SEEK TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF FOOD SAFETY SPECIALISTS, MUCH NEEDED IN THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE SECTOR.THE TWO-YEAR PROJECT IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA POLYTECHNIC STATE UNIVERSITY, SAN LUIS OBISPO (CAL POLY), AND ALLAN HANCOCK COLLEGE - A HISPANIC SERVING AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE (HSACU). LOCATED WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 35 MILES OF ONE ANOTHER, AND WITH FACULTY THAT HAVE A SUCCESSFUL HISTORY OF COLLABORATING WITH THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY, BOTH INSTITUTIONS ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO IMPLEMENT OUTREACH PROJECTS IN THE AREA OF FOOD SAFETY. IN ADDITION, BOTH INSTITUTIONS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN TRAINING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE LABOR FORCE FOR THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY.THE PROGRAM PROVIDES TRAINING ON PRODUCE SAFETY REGULATION, AS WELL AS ASSISTS FARMERS IN CRISIS COMMUNICATION BEST PRACTICES, AND MARKETING AND DATA TOOLS. THESE COMPONENTS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, AS OFTEN SMALL-SCALE FARMS INVOLVED IN FOOD SAFETY OUTBREAKS, DO NOT SURVIVE IN THE MARKET PLACE DUE TO SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC LOSSES AND NEGATIVE PUBLIC PERCEPTION. THE PRODUCE SAFETY REGULATION TRAINING FOCUSES ON SETTING UP THE FARMERS FOR OVERALL SUCCESS IN UNDERSTANDING AND COMPLYING WITH FOOD SAFETY REGULATION. THE MARKETING AND DATA TRAINING HELPS FARMERS IN ESTABLISHING BETTER CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH BUYERS AND KEEPING GOOD RECORDS OF THEIR FOOD SAFETY PRACTICES. FINALLY, THE CRISIS COMMUNICATION TRAINING WILL HELP FARMERS DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INDIVIDUALIZED STRATEGIC PRACTICES IN COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY WITH INDUSTRY PARTNERS, CONSUMERS, AUDITORS, MEDIA, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE EVENT OF A FOOD SAFETY OUTBREAK IN THEIR OWN OPERATION OR IN THEIR PRODUCT CATEGORY.THIS COMPREHENSIVE FOOD SAFETY OUTREACH PROGRAM MEETS AN IMPORTANT NEED OF OUR TARGET GROUP, AND BENEFITS FROM THIS PROGRAM WILL EXTEND BEYOND THE TARGET GROUP TO THE LEAFY GREENS INDUSTRY AND ULTIMATELY TO CONSUMERS. AS SMALL-SCALE FARMERS BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE IN APPLYING BEST PRACTICES IN FOOD SAFETY, THE NUMBER OF FOOD SAFETY OUTBREAKS DECREASES. THIS BENEFITS THE WIDER INDUSTRY, INCLUDING LARGE-SCALE FARMERS, FOOD PROCESSORS, AND RETAILERS - BY INCREASING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN LEAFY GREENS. CONSUMERS ARE ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FOODBORNE ILLNESSES, AND BY BEING ABLE TO CONSUME HEALTHFUL PRODUCTS SUCH AS LEAFY GREENS WITH MORE CONFIDENCE.

THE NECAFS TEAM&#39;S NUMBERS HAVE GROWN FROM 9 AT AN EARLY 2015 NEED/NERA FUNDED PLANNING MEETING TO 19 SERVING AS AN INITIAL FDA PROPOSAL TEAM, TO OVER 433 REGIONAL AND NATIONAL PARTICIPANTS IN EARLY 2018 AFTER 2 YEARS OF NECAFS PROGRAMMING. NECAFS HAS DEMONSTRATED LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING DIVERSE GROUPS TOGETHER AROUND THE TOPIC OF FOOD SAFETY INCLUDING FARMERS, BUYERS, AND PROCESSORS, IN ADDITION TO PEOPLE WORKING IN ACADEMIA, EXTENSION, STATE REGULATORY PROGRAMS, INDUSTRY, AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. A COMBINATION OF COMMUNICATION AND FACILITATION STRATEGIES HAVE SUPPORTED THIS WORK BY ESTABLISHING A FUNCTIONAL NETWORK LEADING TO COLLECTIVE IMPACT. A MONTHLY ENEWSLETTER HIGHLIGHTS EMERGING TOPICS AND PROGRESS ON FOOD SAFETY WORK FROM AROUND THE REGION AND NATION. MONTHLY WEBINARS PROVIDE A LOW-COST, VIRTUAL MEETING SPACE WITH THEMATIC FOCUS AND A MEANS TO PROVIDE REGULAR PERSONAL CONNECTION AMONG THE NETWORK. AN ANNUAL MEETING ATTRACTS PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE REGION AND BEYOND TO CONNECT IN PERSON AND MOVE WORKGROUP EFFORTS ALONG. NECAFS&#39;WORK HAS HELPED TO INTEGRATE STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY PROGRAMS WITH EXTENSION AND COMMUNITY-BASED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, LEVERAGE FIELD OBSERVATIONS INTO RESEARCH QUESTIONS, FOSTER OUTREACH PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LAND-GRANT EXTENSION ORGANIZATIONS, HIGHLIGHT GROWER- AND PROCESSOR-LED INITIATIVES IN ONE STATE FOR POTENTIAL ADOPTION IN OTHER STATES, AND PROVIDE SPACE FOR UNANTICIPATED CONVERSATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE AROUND THE ROLE OF BUYERS IN THE FOOD SAFETY ARENA.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fb0c0b67-cf3f-8e71-00cf-883ce0aa9a3c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20187002028878_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 69573212, "Award ID": "20187002028877", "Award Amount": 788402.76, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-09-17", "CFDA Number": "10.328", "Description": "THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO SUPPORT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE NATIONAL FOOD SAFETY PROGRAM BY COMMUNICATING AND COORDINATING INFORMATION WITHIN THE NORTH CENTRAL REGION (NCR) RELATED TO THE FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT&#39;S (FSMA) PRODUCE SAFETY RULE AND PREVENTIVE CONTROL RULE.THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE:OBJECTIVE 1: EXPAND THE SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED PRODUCE SAFETY NETWORK WITHIN THE NCROBJECTIVE 2: DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A COMMUNICATION SYSTEMOBJECTIVE 3: SUPPORT FOR FOOD SAFETY OUTREACH PROGRAM AWARDSOBJECTIVE 4: REVIEW OF FSMA ADD-ON MATERIALS AND ALTERNATIVE CURRICULAOBJECTIVE 5: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR A CADRE OF REGIONAL FSMA TRAINERSOBJECTIVE 6: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GROWERS, PROCESSORS, AND VENDORS IN THE NCRIN PARTNERSHIP WITH EDUCATORS, REGULATORS, GROWERS AND FOOD PROCESSORS IN ALL 12 STATES (STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT), THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED BY EXPANDING THE REGIONAL PRODUCE SAFETY NETWORK, SUPPORTING FSOP GRANT AWARDEES, AND PROVIDING TRAINING FOR REGIONAL FSMA STAKEHOLDERS.

SINCE MOST FRESH PRODUCE IS EITHER HAND HARVESTED OR HAND PACKED, FOCUSING ON WORKER TRAINING IS A WISE INVESTMENT FOR FARM AND PACKINGHOUSE OWNERS. EVEN IF INDIVIDUAL FARMS AND PACKINGHOUSES ARE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN A PRODUCE-ASSOCIATED FOODBORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAK, IT IMPACTS THE PRODUCTION, MARKETING, AVAILABILITY, AND SALES OF FRESH PRODUCE AS WELL AS CONSUMPTION RATES. SINCE THE CONSUMPTION OF FRESH PRODUCE HAS SO MANY POSITIVE EFFECTS ON HEALTH (E.G., MAINTAINING A HEALTHY WEIGHT, REDUCTION IN CANCER RISKS, REDUCTION IN HEART DISEASE RISKS), IT IS CRITICAL TO BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND THAT NATION THAT FRESH PRODUCE BE SAFE, AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE. ENSURING THAT THE PRODUCE INDUSTRY HAS THE TOOLS TO TRAIN THEIR WORKERS IN ORDER TO REACH THE GOAL OF REDUCING FOOD SAFETY RISKS IS AN IMPORTANT TASK.THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPORT TRAINING NEEDS FOR PRODUCE FARM AND PACKINGHOUSE OWNERS AND WORKERS THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OF MULTILINGUAL EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS FOR FOOD SAFETY TRAINING OF WORKERS.

ON-FARM PRODUCE SAFETY AND QUALITY IS AN ISSUE OF GROWING IMPORTANCE TO STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL-SCALE FARMS AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS IMPROVING OVERALL PUBLIC HEALTH. DEMAND FOR LOCALLY-GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CONTINUES TO SURGE, AND ALONG WITH THAT, BUYER REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO GET STRICTER. INTEREST IN INITIATIVES SUCH AS FARM TO SCHOOL AND FOOD HUBS CONTINUES TO GROW, WHICH IS VERY POSITIVE, BUT FARMERS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE PREPARED TO MEET THE FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY REQUIREMENTS OF THESE MARKETS. SOME OF THESE MARKETS REQUIRE GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES (GAP) CERTIFICATION, WHICH REQUIRES EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION OF THE SAFETY OF THEIR PRODUCE. THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT (FSMA) PRODUCE SAFETY RULE (PSR) IS NOW FINAL, AND COMPLIANCE DATES FOR SOME FARMS BEGUN ONE YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT PRODUCE GROWERS HAVE HAD GOVERNMENT FOOD SAFETY REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON THEM. THE PSR, FOR THE FIRST TIME, SCIENCE-BASED MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE SAFE GROWING, HARVESTING, PACKING, AND HOLDING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES GROWN FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. UNDER FSMA-PSR, ALL FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN PARTICIPANTS MUST COMPLY, WHERE APPLICABLE. FRESH PRODUCE CAN BECOME CONTAMINATED FROM CONTACT WITH SOIL; MANURE; IMPROPERLY COMPOSTED MANURE; IRRIGATION WATER; FECAL MATERIAL FROM WILD AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS; FARM, TERMINAL MARKET WORKERS; CONTAMINATED EQUIPMENT, PACKINGHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM; WASH RINSE AND FLUME WATER; ICE; COOLING EQUIPMENT AND TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES; CROSS-CONTAMINATION FROM OTHER FOODS; AND IMPROPER STORAGE, PACKAGING, AND PREPARATION. FARM OWNERS AND WORKERS HAVE INTIMATE CONTACT WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AS THEY HARVEST, SORT AND PACK THESE FOODS. WORKER HEALTH AND HYGIENE THEREFORE ARE A MATTER OF CONCERN, ESPECIALLY FOR COMMODITIES THAT REQUIRE EXTENSIVE MANIPULATION AND HANDLING DURING HARVESTING, PACKING AND PROCESSING. THUS, FDA FSMA IMPACTS MANYASPECTS OF A FARM OPERATION AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR TRAINING, RECORD-KEEPING, PRODUCT INFORMATION AND TRACEABILITY SYSTEMS, AUDITORS, AND FOOD SAFETY AND LEGAL STAFF. FSMA ALSO TAKES CORPORATE LIABILITY TO A NEW LEVEL BY HOLDING FOOD SAFETY EXECUTIVES ACCOUNTABLE. MANY RETAILERS, RESTAURANTS AND INSTITUTIONS IN METRO AREAS - BIRMINGHAM, HUNTSVILLE, MOBILE, MONTGOMERY, ATLANTA, SAVANNAH, NASHVILLE, CHATTANOOGA, MEMPHIS AND KNOXVILLE - WANT TO PURCHASE LOCAL PRODUCE; HOWEVER, THEIR FOOD SAFETY PLANS AND POLICIES INCREASINGLY REQUIRE THAT THEIR SUPPLIERS BE GAP CERTIFIED OR HAVE SOME KIND OF THIRD PARTY FOOD SAFETY AUDIT. CURRENTLY, ONLY A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF THE SPECIALTY CROP GROWERS IN THE REGION HAVE GAP CERTIFICATION. NOT HAVING GAP CERTIFICATION IS THEREFORE A LARGE AND GROWING BARRIER, AND HENCE AN OPPORTUNITY, FOR INCREASING THE SALES OF SPECIALTY CROPS. THE PROJECT&#39;S LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO INCREASE PRODUCE SALES AND PROFITABILITY OF SPECIALTY CROPS BY PROVIDING GAP TRAINING AND FSMA EDUCATION, RESOURCES, SUPPORT, AND ONGOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GROWERS.. THE RATIONALE IS THAT PREPARING LIMITED-RESOURCE SPECIALTY CROP GROWERS WITH THE FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF PRODUCE SAFETY, FOOD SAFETY LIABILITY RISKS AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS, WILL HELP THEM MAKE BETTER FOOD SAFETY DECISIONS AND COMPLY WITH FSMA.
