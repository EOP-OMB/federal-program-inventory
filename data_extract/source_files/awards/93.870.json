A MIECHV EQUITY DATA DASHBOARD FOR REAL-TIME DATA VISUALIZATION TO DRIVE CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (CQI) EFFORTS AT THE LOCAL IMPLEMENTING AGENCY (LIA), COMMUNITY, AND STATE LEVELS AND LEVERAGE DATA AS A TOOL TOWARDS ELIMINATING STRUCTURAL RACISM. THE DASHBOARD WILL INCLUDE DISAGGREGATED PROGRAM AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATA THAT ALIGN WITH MIECHV PROGRAM METRICS (E.G., PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS, PERFORMANCE MEASURES, SERVICE UTILIZATION) AND TITLE V PRIORITIES. THE PROPOSED INNOVATION, THE DASHBOARD AS A CATALYST FOR A WRAPAROUND TRAINING AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURE, WILL FOCUS ON PROMOTING RACIAL EQUITY AND PARTNERING WITH FAMILIES TO USE DATA TO ADDRESS INEQUITIES, ENHANCE STATE AND LOCAL COLLABORATIONS, AND SUPPORT DATA-DRIVEN DECISION-MAKING IN MA MIECHV COMMUNITIES. PROBLEM: ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS TOWARDS USING DATA TO ADVANCE EQUITY IN MIECHV SERVICE DELIVERY, LACK OF ACCESS TO REAL-TIME, DISAGGREGATED PROGRAM AND CONTEXTUAL DATA LIMITS CQI EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND ADVANCE EQUITY. TRAINING TO INTERPRET DATA WITH A HISTORICAL AND STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS AND FOCUS ON EQUITY AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IS NEEDED. PURPOSE: MA MIECHV AIMS TO DEVELOP LIA CAPACITY AND ENGAGE FAMILIES IN USING THE DASHBOARD TO DESIGN DATA-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS RACIAL INEQUITIES IN MIECHV METRICS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO DRIVE IMPROVEMENT IN THE FOUR PROGRAM PRIORITY AREAS IDENTIFIED IN THE NOTICE OF FUNDING O PPORTUNITY. GOAL AND OBJECTIVES: USING RACIAL EQUITY, FAMILY ENGAGEMENT, AND CQI FRAMEWORKS, THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED INNOVATION TO FACILITATE EQUITABLE SERVICE DELIVERY. OBJECTIVES ARE TO 1) IDENTIFY SUPPORTS FOR THE DASHBOARD AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURE; 2) ENSURE THE DASHBOARD IS RELEVANT TO LIA AND COMMUNITY CONTEXTS; 3) PREPARE DATA FOR VISUALIZATION; 4) DEVELOP A CQI PARENT LEADER MODEL; 5) DEVELOP TRAINING AND SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR LIA TEAMS; 6) PILOT AND REFINE THE DASHBOARD; 7) IMPLEMENT THE DASHBOARD AND SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE; 8) EVALUATE THE PROCESS, OUTCOMES, AND IMPACT. METHODOLOGY: MA MIECHV WILL ENGAGE LIAS IN THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION OF THE DASHBOARD TO ENSURE IT IS A USEFUL CQI TOOL TO ADVANCE EQUITY. THE DASHBOARD WILL INCLUDE REAL-TIME DATA VISUALIZATION OF DISAGGREGATED DATA BY RACE, ETHNICITY, GENDER, AND LANGUAGE. DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS WILL ALLOW FOR INTEGRATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE DATA (E.G., WIC, EARLY INTERVENTION, VITAL RECORDS) TO CONTEXTUALIZE MIECHV METRICS AND INFORM DATA-DRIVEN RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGIES AT THE COMMUNITY-LEVEL. CQI PARENT LEADERS WILL PARTNER WITH LIAS TO INTERPRET AND USE THE DASHBOARD TO DESIGN SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF IDENTIFIED INEQUITIES AND IMPROVE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND OUTCOMES. RACIAL EQUITY TRAINING FOR LIA STAFF AND CQI PARENT LEADERS WILL SET THE FOUNDATION FOR USING DATA AS A TOOL TOWARDS ELIMINATING STRUCTURAL RACISM.

PROGRAM FUNDS REQUESTED: $4,000,000 FUNDING PRIORITY AREA: TRACK ONE, PRIORITY AREAS 4 AND 3  ANNOTATION: THIS APPLICATION IS A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT BETWEEN THE IOWA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO MEET THE HOME VISITING WORKFORCE NEEDS OF THE TWO STATES. THE INNOVATION THAT IS BEING PROPOSED IS TO DEVELOP AN INTERACTIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCE APPLICATION (APP) THAT IS COMPETENCY BASED TO PROVIDE CAREER PATHWAYS FOR HOME VISITORS AS A RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGY FOR THE FIELD. THIS INTERACTIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCE WILL BE DEVELOPED AS A CLOUD BASED SOLUTION, ACCESSED VIA A SOFTWARE APPLICATION (APP) DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROJECT. THE PROJECT WILL ASSIST IN GROWING THE HOME VISITING WORKFORCE WITH PERSONS THAT REFLECT THE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS OF THE FAMILIES SERVED AND IMPROVE EQUITY AMONG HOME VISITING PARTICIPANTS, POPULATIONS AND SYSTEMS.  PROBLEM: THE HOME VISITING WORKFORCE HAS EXPERIENCED ISSUES IN RETENTION OF STAFF, WHICH ARE EXACERBATED DUE TO COVID-19. ADDITIONALLY, RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE CURRENT HOME VISITING WORKFORCE IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FAMILIES SERVED. HOME VISITORS WITHOUT LIVED EXPERTISE, INCLUDING PARENTING, HAVE A STEEP CLIMB TO BUILD WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH HOME VISITING PARTICIPANTS. HOME VISITORS WHO MORE CLOSELY REFLECT THE LIVED EXPERIENCES AND, UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE, AND SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF THE PARENTS BEING SERVED HAVE AN EASIER TIME ENGAGING IN A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP PARTNERSHIP WITH PARENTS.  PURPOSE: THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS ISSUES IN RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF HOME VISI TORS, WHILE IMPLEMENTING APPROACHES THAT BUILD A MORE EQUITABLE AND REPRESENTATIVE WORKFORCE. THE PROJECT WILL UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY TO ASSESS RELATIONAL COMPETENCE OF PARENTS AND MAP THEIR READINESS TO ENTER THE HOME VISITING WORKFORCE. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT HOME VISITING SUPERVISORS ARE PREPARED TO ASSIST THE NEW HOME VISITOR TO BE FULLY SUCCESSFUL AND RETAINED.  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: THE PROJECT HAS SEVEN MAJOR GOALS; 1) IMPLEMENT A FRAMEWORK TO MEASURE RELATIONAL COMPETENCIES, 2) CREATE A CAREER PATHWAY FOR NON-TRADITIONAL HOME VISITORS, 3) CREATE PRESERVICE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, 4) INCREASE EQUITY AND ACCESS TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONTENT, 5) ENHANCE ORGANIZATIONAL READINESS, 6) DECREASE HOME VISITOR ISOLATION RESULTING IN INCREASED RETENTION, 7) INCREASE THE AVAILABLE DATA AND RESEARCH ON THE HOME VISITING WORKFORCE.  METHODOLOGY: THE PROPOSED INNOVATION WILL IMPROVE EQUITY WITHIN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND STRENGTHEN RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF A REPRESENTATIVE HOME VISITING WORKFORCE WITH SUPERB RELATIONAL SKILLS, THROUGH ACCESSIBLE, RELEVANT, AND RELATIONAL ONLINE LEARNING. FURTHER, THIS PROJECT WILL ENHANCE ORGANIZATIONAL READINESS BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS FOR SUPERVISORS THAT LEAD TO IMPROVED RETENTION AND DECREASED ISOLATION OF HOME VISITORS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 4000000.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2555f7fc-4bad-7a0b-ac36-903e91cf7bbd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U4G45639_7526"}, {"internal_id": 147874120, "Award ID": "U4G45638", "Award Amount": 2000000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-04", "CFDA Number": "93.870", "Description": "AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDING FOR HOME VISITING - INNOVATION - ANNOTATION: THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA PROPOSES TO INTRODUCE TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN INNOVATIONS AIMING TO STREAMLINE AND AMPLIFY THE METHODS OF CARE COORDINATION AMONG HOME VISITING (HV) PROGRAMS MANAGED UNDER THE OKLAHOMA STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.  THE CORE INNOVATION COMPONENT RELIES ON A READILY AVAILABLE, END-TO-END SYSTEMS OF CARE SOLUTION, THE UNITE US SOCIAL CARE APPLICATION.  THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BIDIRECTIONAL, ELECTRONIC CARE COORDINATION AND DATA EXCHANGE SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY TARGETS NARROWING INEQUITY GAPS IN CLIENT ACCESS TO CARE AND SUPPORTS.   PROBLEM: PHASED APPLICATION USAGE IS STRATEGICALLY PLANNED AROUND CONNECTING CLIENTS TO CRITICAL SOCIAL SUPPORTS IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND STRONGLY RELATED TO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.  TARGETED AREAS INCLUDE CONNECTIONS TO: (A) STATE\u2019S LEGAL AID SERVICES ORGANIZATION TO COMBAT HOUSING, UTILITY, AND FOOD CRISES; (B) STATE\u2019S EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEM, SOONERSTART, TO ADDRESS CONCERNS OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS EXACERBATED BY PANDEMIC ISOLATION; AND (C) NEWLY DEVELOPED PARENT CHILD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO COMBAT PANDEMIC SPIKES IN ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AMONG YOUNG ADULTS.   PURPOSE: THE PROPOSED WORK PLAN TOUCHES UPON ALL 4 PRIORITY AREAS OUTLINED IN THIS HV INNOVATION AWARD FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT.  USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION WILL ENABLE POINT-OF-CARE DATA CAPTURE OF SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AFFECTING ELIGIBLE AND PARTICIPATING HOME VISITING CLIENTS (PRIORITY 1). UNITE US WILL ALSO EXPEDITE INTEGRATION OF THESE DATA (PRIORITY 2) ACROSS SYSTEMS OF CARE THAT CONFRONT DISPARITIES IN NEIGHBORHOOD ADVERSITY, ECONOMIC STABILITY, EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, AND BASIC NECESSITIES.  THE BIDIRECTIONAL DATA EXCHANGE FACILITATED BY THIS INNOVATIVE PORTAL WILL ALSO AMPLIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN HV CLIENTS (PRIORITY 3).  A STRONGER REFERRAL NETWORK WILL PROMOTE GREATER HOME VISITING ACCESS FOR THOSE HISTORICALLY UNSERVED BUT WHO SEEK CARE FROM THE CRITICAL SERVICE AG ENCIES HIGHLIGHTED ABOVE.  RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE DESIGNATED AGENCIES ARE DUAL PURPOSED AND INTENTIONALLY SELECTED TO ALSO ADDRESS CLIENT CRISES THAT FREQUENTLY PRECEDE HV SERVICE DROPOUT.  BETTER CLIENT ACCESS TO SUPPORTS DURING TIMES OF CRISIS IS THEORIZED TO ENHANCE CASELOAD RETENTION.  FINALLY, THE USE OF THESE TOOLS WILL ALSO BE ACCOMPANIED BY NEW WORKER TRAININGS (PRIORITY 4) ON INCORPORATING THE APPLICATIONS IN PRACTICE, BEST PRACTICES ON IDENTIFICATION OF NEEDS AND RISKS, AND THE BENEFITS OF LOCAL CRISIS INTERVENTIONS.   GOAL(S) AND OBJECTIVES: THE MAJOR GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN HV\u2019S COMMUNITY SUPPORT NETWORK AND EQUIP HV PROVIDERS WITH NEXT GENERATION INFLUX AND EFFLUX REFERRAL TECHNOLOGY AND TRAINING TO REDUCE KNOWN HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE DISPARITIES AMONG HOME VISITING FAMILIES WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO CRISES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC.  GOAL ATTAINMENT AIMS TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: (1) INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS FOR HV SERVICES, (2) INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OUTGOING REFERRALS TO QUALITY SERVICES, (3) CLOSE THE REFERRAL LOOP FOR OUTGOING REFERRALS TO LASO, SOONERSTART, AND PCAP, (4) INCREASE RETENTION OF CLIENTS, PARTICULARLY AMONG GROUPS FACING CARE INEQUITY, (5) ENHANCE THE ASSESSMENT AND CARE COORDINATION SKILLS OF OUR HV WORKFORCE, AND (6) DISSEMINATE LESSONS LEARNED AND IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESSES TO THE NATIONAL HV COMMUNITY.   METHODOLOGY: TO ACCOMPLISH GOALS, OSDH WILL CONTRACT WITH THE CENTER ON CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT (CCAN) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER (OUHSC) TO COORDINATE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APPLICATIONS THROUGHOUT DESIGNATED REGIONS OF THE STATE.

ANNOTATION: THIS PROPOSAL SUPPORTS VIRTUAL DELIVERY OF EVIDENCE-BASED HOME VISITATION (EBHV) BY GENERATING KNOWLEDGE ON IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A VIDEO-COACHING INNOVATION. VIRTUAL EBHV WAS RAPIDLY IMPLEMENTED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, BUT IT IS STILL MOSTLY UNKNOWN HOW VIRTUAL SERVICES IMPACT FAMILY INVOLVEMENT. WE WILL: 1) COMBINE PROGRAM AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATA TO STUDY VIRTUAL SERVICES; AND 2) DESIGN, PILOT, AND EVALUATE A WORKFORCE VIDEO-COACHING INNOVATION TO INCREASE FAMILY RETENTION. THE PROPOSED INNOVATION WILL PROMOTE THE SUCCESS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF VIRTUAL EBHV DELIVERY AND REACH RURAL, UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECTED BY COVID-19.  PROBLEM: PRIOR TO COVID-19, FAMILY INVOLVEMENT WITH IN-PERSON EBHV WAS GREATLY VARIABLE. NATIONALLY, FEWER THAN HALF OF FAMILIES (46%) PARTICIPATING IN MULTIYEAR EBHV WERE RETAINED FOR ONE YEAR. IN ARKANSAS, ROUGHLY 15% PERCENT OF FAMILIES LEFT SERVICES IN THE FIRST 90 DAYS, AND ANOTHER 25% LEFT WITHIN THE FIRST 180 DAYS. AFTER THE START OF COVID-19, THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLETED HOME VISITS, SUGGESTING POSSIBLE LESSENING OF FAMILY INVOLVEMENT. FURTHER, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VIRTUAL DELIVERY OF EBHV IS STILL LARGELY UNKNOWN. PURPOSE: THERE ARE TWO GOALS FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT: 1) TO UNDERSTAND AND 2) TO IMPROVE UPON THE CURRENT PRACTICES OF VIRTUAL VISITS USING A NEW INNOVATION OF VIDEO COACHING TO SUPPORT RAPPORT-BUILDING DURING THE INTAKE PHASE TO PROMOTE FAMILY INVOLVEMENT.  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: GOAL 1: GENERATE KNOWLEDGE ON THE RETENTION, EQUITY, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF VIRTUAL VISITS. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE WILL 1) DETERMINE IF THE CONTENT OF HOME VISITS DIFFERS BASED ON THE DELIVERY METHOD AND STRUCTURAL AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SSDOH), 2) DETERMINE HOW DELIVERY METHODS AND SSDOH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH EBHV DURATION AND INTENSITY, AND 3) DETERMINE HOW HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION OUTCOMES AND IMMUNIZATION COMPLETION OF EBHV PARTICIPANTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HOME VISITING DELIVERY METHODS AND SSDOH. GOAL 2: INCREASE RETENTION RATES IN VIRTUAL SERVICES. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE WILL 1) DESIGN AND PILOT A VIDEO-COACHING INTERVENTION THAT STRENGTHENS RELATIONSHIP-BUILDING DURING THE INTAKE PHASE OF HOME VISITATION, 2) ENGAGE KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO COLLECT FEEDBACK ON ADAPTATIONS NEEDED TO MAKE VIDEO COACHING FEASIBLE FOR WIDESPREAD EBVH IMPLEMENTATION, AND 3) EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VIDEO COACHING, OVERALL AND BY PARTICIPANTS\u2019 RISK-FACTORS.  METHODOLOGY: VIDEO COACHING PROVIDES TRAINEES A DIRECT LEARNING EXPERIENCE AS SERVICES TRANSITION TO VIRTUAL MODALITIES. COACHES REVIEW TRAINEES\u2019 PERFORMANCES, WORK WITH THEM TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT, AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR ADJUSTMENTS. THIS PILOT INTERVENTION WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FIRST 3 MONTHS OF SERVICES, WHICH ARE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FOR PARTICIPANTS\u2019 ENGAGEMENT. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT HOME VISITORS WHO RECEIVE COACHING (N=36) WILL DEMONSTRATE IMPROVED TECHNICAL SKILLS COMPARED TO HOME VISITORS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THE INTERVENTION (N=48), AS ASSESSED BY HOVRS SCALES AND LENGTH OF FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN SERVICES (GOAL 2). USING DATA FROM SELF-REFLECTIONS ON THE COACHING EXPERIENCE, WE WILL ALSO ASSESS HOME VISITORS\u2019 VIEWS ON THE UTILITY OF THIS INTERVENTION. TO ESTABLISH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VIRTUAL VISITS, WE WILL COMPARE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA TO EBHV PARTICIPANTS OF SIMILAR BACKGROUND WHO RECEIVED IN-PERSON VISITS (GOAL 1).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": 1999754.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f67c91cf-d824-5d22-67e1-a6ce7f3be1eb-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U4G45637_7526"}, {"internal_id": 89517591, "Award ID": "U1X31658", "Award Amount": 2294812.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-03-13", "CFDA Number": "93.110", "Description": "SUPPORTING MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH INNOVATION IN STATES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "9c6784a3-1e89-1398-969f-aec1ee8f1a4d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U1X31658_7526"}, {"internal_id": 89520655, "Award ID": "U0100001", "Award Amount": 9051187.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-03-13", "CFDA Number": "93.877", "Description": "PARTNERSHIP FOR STATE TITLE V MCH LEADERSHIP COMMUNITY COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6540a514-e35a-6aac-9142-f6fbb720f09a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U0100001_7526"}]
