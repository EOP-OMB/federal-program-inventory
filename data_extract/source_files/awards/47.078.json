THESE DESERT SOILS ARE ONE OF THE MOST ORGANIC-POOR ON EARTH YET HOST A COMMUNITY OF MICROORGANISMS. MICROBIAL MAT MATERIAL IS EXPORTED FROM THE SHALLOW, GAS-SUPERSATURATED REGIONS OF THE LAKES WHEN GAS BUBBLES FORM IN THE MATS, LIFTING THEM TO THE ICE COVER; THE PERENNIAL ICE COVER MAINTAINS GAS SUPERSATURATION. THESE MATS FREEZE IN AND ARE EXPORTED TO THE SURROUNDING SOILS THROUGH ICE ABLATION. THE LARGEST SEASONAL DECREASE AND THINNEST ICE COVER IN THE HISTORY OF LAKE FRYXELL WAS RECORDED DURING THE 2022-2023 AUSTRAL SUMMER. IN THIS THIN ICE YEAR, THE WATER COLUMN DISSOLVED OXYGEN INCREASED OVER PRIOR OBSERVATIONS, AND THE LAKE BOTTOM SURFACE AREA WITH BUBBLE-DISRUPTED MAT WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT OBSERVED IN 1980-1981 AND 2006-2007. THIS WORK WILL CONSTRAIN MAT MOBILIZATION WITHIN AND OUT OF LAKE FRYXELL IN THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS DURING A PERIOD OF UNPRECEDENTED ICE THINNING TO UNDERSTAND HOW FUTURE CHANGING REGIONAL CLIMATE AND PREDICTED SEASONAL LOSS OF LAKE ICE COVER WILL AFFECT NUTRIENT TRANSPORT IN THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS. EXCEPTIONAL YEARS OF MAT EXPORT ARE HYPOTHESIZED TO HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON NUTRIENT EXPORT TO SOIL COMMUNITIES; VARIABILITY IN MAT LIFTOFF MAY THUS PLAY A ROLE IN THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE TO CHANGING CLIMATE. THE PERENNIAL ICE COVER OF LAKES IN THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS OF ANTARCTICA MODULATES THE TRANSFER OF GASSES, ORGANIC AND INORGANIC MATERIAL, BETWEEN THE LAKES AND SURROUNDING SOILS. THE EXPORT OF BIOMASS IN THESE LAKES IS DRIVEN BY THE SUPERSATURATION OF ATMOSPHERIC GASSES IN THE SHALLOW REGIONS UNDER PERENNIAL ICE COVER. GAS BUBBLES NUCLEATE IN THE MATS, PRODUCING BUOYANCY THAT LIFTS THEM TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ICE, WHERE THEY FREEZE IN AND ARE EXPORTED TO THE SURROUNDING SOILS THROUGH ICE ABLATION. THESE MATS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF BIOMASS AND NUTRIENTS TO THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS SOILS, WHICH ARE AMONG THE MOST ORGANIC-POOR ON EARTH. NEVERTHELESS, THIS BIOMASS REMAINS UNACCOUNTED FOR IN ORGANIC CARBON CYCLING MODELS FOR THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS. ICE COVER DATA FROM THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS LONG TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH PROJECT SHOWS THAT THE ICE THICKNESS HAS UNDERGONE CYCLICAL VARIATION OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS, REACHING THE LARGEST SEASONAL DECREASE AND THINNEST ICE-COVER IN THE RECORDED HISTORY OF LAKE FRYXELL DURING THE 2022-2023 AUSTRAL SUMMER. PRELIMINARY WORK SHOWS THAT THE SURFACE AREA WITH MAT LIFTOFF AT LAKE FRYXELL IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT OBSERVED IN 1980-1981 AND 2006-2007, COINCIDING WITH THIS UNPRECEDENTED THINNING OF THE ICE-COVER AND AN INCREASE IN THE WATER COLUMN DISSOLVED O2. THIS RESEARCH WILL CONSTRAIN BIOMASS MOBILIZATION WITHIN AND OUT OF LAKE FRYXELL IN THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS DURING A PERIOD OF UNPRECEDENTED ICE THINNING. THE RESEARCHERS HYPOTHESIZE THAT A THINNER ICE COVER PROMOTES MORE BIOMASS MOBILIZATION BY 1) STIMULATING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION OF GAS BUBBLES FROM THE EXISTING GAS-SUPERSATURATED WATERS DURING SUMMERTIME PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO CREATE MICROBIAL MAT LIFTOFF AND 2) PROMOTING MAT LIFTOFF IN DEEPER, THICKER MICROBIAL MATS, AND 3) THAT THIS BIOMASS CAN BE TRACED INTO THE SOILS BY CHARACTERIZING ITS CHEMISTRY AND MODELING THE MOST LIKELY DEPOSITIONAL SETTINGS. THIS WORK WILL USE MICROBIAL MAT SAMPLES, LAKE DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION DATA AND UNDERWATER DRONE FOOTAGE DOCUMENTING THE DEPTH DISTRIBUTION OF LIFTOFF MATS IN JANUARY 2023, AND LONG-TERM ICE COVER THICKNESS, PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION, AND LAKE LEVEL CHANGE DATA COLLECTED BY THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS LONG TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH PROJECT TO TEST HYPOTHESES 1-3.

THE RADIATIVE FORCING ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PRESENCE OF BLACK CARBON ON THE CRYOSPHERE IS ONE OF THE LEAST CONSTRAINED VARIABLES OF GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS, SO A HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY EXISTS AMONG MODELLED SMOKE DEPOSITION, CONCENTRATIONS OF BLACK CARBON IN SNOW, AND THE WEATHERING CRUST ON THE SURFACE OF THE ICE SHEET. THIS UNIQUE WILDFIRE SEASON PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MODEL VERIFICATION. THE STUDY WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST VERIFICATION OF THE 1/3RD DEGREE SMOKE DEPOSITION OUTPUT FROM THE NAVY AEROSOL ANALYSIS PREDICTION SYSTEM (NAAPS) GLOBAL AEROSOL MODEL, WHICH PROVIDES HIGH-RESOLUTION BLACK CARBON DEPOSITION AS AN OUTPUT.

RECENT RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT THESE POLLUTING PARTICLES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN THE MOST PRISTINE ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING THE ARCTIC AND ANTARCTICA. THERE IS CURRENTLY A LACK OF DATA ON HOW MICROPLASTICS AND NANOPLASTICS ARE DISTRIBUTED IN AREAS THAT ARE FAR AWAY FROM CONTAMINATING SOURCES (E.G., CITIES). A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION WOULD HELP TO BUILD THE MODELS THAT CAN TELL US THE FATE OF SUCH PARTICLES ON OUR PLANET. IN THE CASE OF ANTARCTICA, THE FEW EXISTING STUDIES OF MICROPLASTICS AND NANOPLASTICS HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THESE POLLUTANTS IN OCEAN WATERS, APART FROM ONE STUDY THAT FOCUSED ON SAMPLES COLLECTED OVER ICE AND SNOW IN THE VICINITY OF ROSS ISLAND. THIS EAGER PROJECT WOULD LEVERAGE SAMPLES OF SNOW COLLECTED BY A BRITISH EXPLORER DURING AN UNSUPPORTED SKI TRAVERSE ACROSS ANTARCTICA THAT WILL LEAD HIM FROM THE COAST OF ANTARCTICA TO THE SOUTH POLE. SAMPLES WILL THEN BE ANALYZED FOR MICROPLASTICS AND NANOPLASTICS USING A STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITY. THE DATA ANALYSIS WILL ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS: ARE THERE STILL PRISTINE AREAS ON EARTH THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONTAMINATED BY MICROPLASTICS AND NANOPLASTICS? WHAT IS THE CONCENTRATION OF THESE POLLUTANTS WITHIN THE SOUTH POLE SNOW? THIS PROJECT WILL QUANTIFY THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF MICROPLASTICS AND NANOPLASTICS IN ANTARCTICA FROM THE COAST TO THE INTERIOR. RESULTS WILL PROVIDE A BETTER PROCESS UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODELS THAT CAN BE USED TO QUANTIFY THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF MICROPLASTICS AND TO BETTER ASSESS HOW THEY INTERACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERE. NANOPLASTICS CAN BE SMALLER THAN 2.5 ?M AND ARE THEREFORE NOT WELL CHARACTERIZED DUE LIMITATIONS IN THE METHODS. THESE PARTICLES ARE OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THE ECOSYSTEM DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BODIES OF VARIOUS ORGANISMS, SUCH AS PHYTOPLANKTON, ZOOPLANKTON, FISH, AND BACTERIA. THIS PROJECT WILL USE AN ULTRASENSITIVE STIMULATED RAMAN SCATTERING (SRS) PLATFORM TO CHARACTERIZE NANOPLASTICS SMALLER THAN 2.5 ?M. THE SRS WAS DEVELOPED BY THIS TEAM AND HAS PROVEN TO BE A POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY FOR STUDYING THE HEALTH IMPACT OF NANOPLASTICS AT THIS SCALE. THE SAMPLES COLLECTED ON THE TRAVERSE OFFER A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DEPOSITIONAL FLUXES OF PLASTIC IN THE REMOTEST REGION ON EARTH, AND IMPORTANTLY, SHOW HOW THE CONCENTRATION OF PLASTICS VARY FROM THE SURROUNDING OCEANS TO THE SCIENTIFIC BASE AT THE SOUTH POLE. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MICROPLASTICS AND NANOPLASTICS WILL BE AFFECTED BY BOTH LOCAL HUMAN ACTIVITIES (E.G., AT SOUTH POLE) AND POSSIBLY BY THE LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT BY WINDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT. THE COMBINATION OF THE DATA ACQUIRED DURING THE ANTARCTIC TRAVERSE AND THE NEW SRS PLATFORM MAKES THIS PROJECT UNIQUE FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW.

WHILE NO SINGLE CAUSE OF THEIR DECLINE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED, ONE SUGGESTION IS THAT WARMING HAS RESULTED IN THE GROWTH OF MORE, LARGER SHRUBS THAT ARE LESS NUTRITIOUS FOR CARIBOU THAN PLANTS THEY PREFER SUCH AS GRASSES AND FORBS (SMALLER FLOWERING PLANTS). WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CARIBOU NEAR KANGERLUSSUAQ, GREENLAND SINCE 2002, AND IN THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS IN THE AREA HAVE DROPPED STEADILY. MOREOVER, IN 2022 THEY PRODUCED NO CALVES IN THE AREA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE PAST 20 YEARS. WE WILL REVISIT THE AREA IN THE SUMMER OF 2023 TO SURVEY THE NUMBER OF CARIBOU THERE, ASSESS CALF PRODUCTION, AND COLLECT SHRUBS, GRASSES, AND FORBS FOR ANALYSIS OF THEIR NUTRITIVE CONTENT. THESE MEASURES OF CARIBOU FOOD QUALITY WILL BE COMPARED TO SIMILAR MEASURES TAKEN IN THE AREA IN 2005 WHEN IT WAS COOLER, CARIBOU WERE MORE ABUNDANT, AND SHRUBS WERE SMALLER AND LESS COMMON. THIS WILL HELP DETERMINE WHETHER WARMING HAS REDUCED FOOD QUALITY FOR CARIBOU NEAR KANGERLUSSUAQ, AND WHETHER THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR DECLINE. CARIBOU ARE IMPORTANT FOR HUNTING AND TOURISM IN THE KANGERLUSSUAQ AREA AND RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE SHARED WITH THE GREENLAND INSTITUTE OF NATURAL RESOURCES WHO OVERSEES MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF CARIBOU IN GREENLAND. RESULTS MIGHT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING OF FACTORS INFLUENCING DECLINES OF CARIBOU AND REINDEER IN OTHER PARTS OF THE ARCTIC WHERE THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO TRADITIONAL LIVELIHOODS. ACROSS THE ARCTIC, CARIBOU AND WILD REINDEER (BOTH RANGIFER TARANDUS) ARE IN DECLINE, WITH MORE THAN 50% OF THE SPECIES? TOTAL ABUNDANCE HAVING BEEN LOST OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE ARCTIC HAS WARMED AT A RATE 2-3X THE GLOBAL AVERAGE. WHILE NO SINGLE FACTOR LIKELY EXPLAINS THE SPECIES? DECLINE, SOME EVIDENCE LINKS IT TO A WARMING-RELATED INCREASING DOMINANCE OF ARCTIC TUNDRA BY SHRUBS THAT ARE LESS PALATABLE TO CARIBOU AND WILD REINDEER THAN THE GRASSES AND FORBS THEY PREFER. NEAR KANGERLUSSUAQ, GREENLAND OUR ANNUAL SURVEYS OF CARIBOU THAT BEGAN IN 2002 HAVE REVEALED AN 80% DECLINE IN THEIR NUMBERS SINCE 2005 AND A COMPLETE REPRODUCTIVE FAILURE (I.E., A LACK OF CALVES) FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SUMMER 2022. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THIS DECLINE AND REPRODUCTIVE FAILURE MIGHT RELATE TO AN INCREASE IN SHRUB ABUNDANCE AT THE SITE COINCIDENT WITH SUMMER WARMING. WE WILL RETURN TO THE SITE IN SUMMER 2023 TO ASSESS THE STATUS OF CARIBOU THERE THROUGH SURVEYS OF TOTAL ABUNDANCE AND CALF PRODUCTION, AND TO ASSESS THE NUTRITIVE STATUS OF VEGETATION THROUGH SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS OF CARBON AND NITROGEN CONTENT OF SHRUBS, GRASSES AND SEDGES, AND FORBS. THIS WILL FACILITATE A TEST OF OUR HYPOTHESIS THROUGH COMPARISON TO SIMILAR DATA COLLECTED AT THE SITE IN SUMMER 2005, WHEN CARIBOU WERE MORE ABUNDANT, CALF PRODUCTION WAS NEAR MAXIMAL, SHRUBS WERE SMALLER AND LESS ABUNDANT, AND MID-SUMMER MEAN TEMPERATURE WAS NEARLY 1OC COOLER. CARIBOU AND WILD REINDEER ARE IMPORTANT TO TRADITIONAL LIVELIHOODS AND CULTURAL INTEGRITY THROUGHOUT THE ARCTIC, AND THEIR DECLINE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DECLINES IN TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, AND SOCIAL COHESION IN SOME LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

EXPERT PROFESSIONAL STAFF, WITH GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, WILL MANAGE AND OPERATE A SET OF FOUNDATIONAL CAPABILITIES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR CURRENT RESEARCH SUPPORT, AS WELL AS FRONTIER ACTIVITIES THAT WILL ENABLE FUTURE RESEARCH. THE FACILITY WILL PROMOTE ADVANCES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EARTH STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS, EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS, AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE SOLID EARTH, HYDROSPHERE, AND ATMOSPHERE THROUGH MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF: 1) GLOBAL AND REGIONAL CONTINUOUSLY OPERATING SEISMIC NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE GLOBAL SEISMOGRAPHIC NETWORK; 2) PORTABLE GEOPHYSICAL INSTRUMENTATION FOR USE IN PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR DRIVEN AND COMMUNITY EXPERIMENTS; 3) DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR THE COLLECTION, QUALITY ASSURANCE, CURATION, MANAGEMENT, AND DISTRIBUTION OF OPEN ACCESS DATA AND DATA PRODUCTS; AND 4) EDUCATION, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND PUBLIC OUTREACH PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO BE INCLUSIVE AND ENHANCE PARTICIPATION OF TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN THE GEOSCIENCES. THE SEISMOLOGICAL FACILITIES PROVIDED THROUGH THE SAGE CONTRIBUTE TO ISSUES OF NATIONAL/GLOBAL STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE, INCLUDING GEOHAZARD ASSESSMENT AND DISASTER RESILIENCE; ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; NATIONAL SECURITY; AND STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS) EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. DATA AND DATA PRODUCTS FROM SAGE WILL BE USED BY STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION, NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, FOR MISSION AGENCY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING EARTHQUAKE MONITORING AND CHARACTERIZATION, TSUNAMI WARNING, WEATHER FORECASTING, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, AND NUCLEAR TEST MONITORING. SAGE PROGRAMS WILL ALSO SUPPORT INQUIRY-BASED SCIENCE EDUCATION, ENHANCING STUDENTS' ABILITIES TO ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE, AND ENABLING THEM TO PURSUE STEM CAREERS IN ACADEMIA, INDUSTRY, BUSINESS, AND GOVERNMENT. THE SAGE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES PROMOTE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND SCIENCE LITERACY. THE SAGE FACILITY PROVIDES INSTRUMENTATION SERVICES; DATA SERVICES; AND EDUCATION, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF SEISMOLOGY. RESEARCHERS USE SAGE TO GAIN VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO FUNDAMENTAL EARTH PROCESSES, AND SAGE ALSO PROVIDES KEY DATA FOR NATIONAL SECURITY NEEDS, INCLUDING MONITORING EFFORTS OF CLANDESTINE NUCLEAR TESTS. THE SCIENTIFIC PRIORITIES OF THE NEW FACILITY WOULD ENABLE ADVANCES IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: (1) GLOBAL EARTH STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS: THE FACILITY WOULD ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO RESOLVE THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH'S INTERIOR AND ENABLE INVESTIGATORS TO STUDY PROCESSES THAT DRIVE PLATE TECTONICS AND NATURAL HAZARDS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES, TSUNAMIS, AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. (2) FAULT ZONES AND THE EARTHQUAKE CYCLE: OVER THE LAST DECADE, SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED A BROAD ARRAY OF FAULT ZONE SLIP BEHAVIORS THAT SPAN A WIDE VARIETY OF TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES. THE SAGE FACILITY WILL ENABLE A VARIETY OF SEISMIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC MEASUREMENTS TO ELUCIDATE HOW THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEHAVIORS START AND STOP, VARY ALONG FAULT ZONES, AND INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER. (3) MAGMAS AND VOLATILES IN THE CRUST AND MANTLE: GEOPHYSICAL INSTRUMENTATION IS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING VOLCANIC SYSTEMS AND MINIMIZING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH VOLCANIC HAZARDS. THE CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY SAGE WILL ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO STUDY MELT PRODUCTION, MONITOR ITS TRANSPORT THROUGH THE CRUST, AND MAP OUT THE PLUMBING SYSTEMS OF VOLCANOES. (4) HYDROSPHERE, CRYOSPHERE, AND ATMOSPHERE: AN AREA OF INCREASING COMMUNITY INTEREST IS UTILIZING GEOPHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS TO STUDY PROCESSES AT THE EARTH'S SURFACE. THE SAGE FACILITY WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDY PROCESSES IN THE NEAR-SURFACE, SUCH AS HYDROLOGY, CRYOSPHERIC PROCESSES, AND GLACIER DYNAMICS. (5) EDUCATION, PUBLIC OUTREACH, AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT: SAGE WILL DEVELOP A VARIETY OF EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND ENABLE HUNDREDS OF UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES. A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE SAGE ACTIVITIES WILL BE ON BROADENING PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS THROUGH IRIS' NEW URBAN GEOSYSTEMS FOCUS. ADDITIONALLY, THE FACILITY WILL DEVELOP ANIMATIONS, SIMULATIONS, AND OTHER VISUALIZATIONS OF EARTH PROCESSES TO HELP INSTRUCTORS AT ALL LEVEL TEACH ABOUT EARTH SCIENCE.

THEY ARE NEEDED TO ADAPT TO AND PLAN FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE CHANGE, BOTH IN THE ARCTIC AND FOR THE REST OF THE PLANET. CLIMATE MODELS SHOW THAT WARMING TEMPERATURES AND ARCTIC SEA ICE LOSS WILL CONTINUE WITH INCREASING GREENHOUSE GAS CONCENTRATIONS. HOWEVER, THESE MODELS SHOW LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE RATE OF WARMING AND SEA ICE LOSS. THESE MODEL DIFFERENCES LARGELY COME FROM IMPERFECT REPRESENTATION OF THE INTERACTIONS AMONG THE ATMOSPHERE, SEA ICE, AND OCEAN. ONE OF THE KEY INTERACTIONS IS THE REFLECTION OF SUNLIGHT BY SEA ICE. IN THE SPRING, SEA ICE IS SNOW-COVERED AND REFLECTS 85% OF SUNLIGHT KEEPING THE SURFACE COOL. HOWEVER, MOVING INTO SUMMER, THE ICE MELTS AND THE AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT REFLECTED DECREASES, WARMING THE SURFACE RESULTING IN MORE MELT. IT IS CRITICAL TO ACCURATELY REPRESENT THIS PROCESS IN MODELS. THIS PROJECT WILL COMBINE OBSERVATIONS AND CLIMATE MODELS TO BETTER SIMULATE THE PROCESSES CONTROLLING THE INTERACTION OF SUNLIGHT AND SEA ICE AND THEIR IMPACT ON SEA ICE MELT. THIS MODELING EFFORT WILL LEAD TO REFINED REPRESENTATION OF SEA ICE IN CLIMATE MODELS, WHICH WILL IMPROVE PREDICTIONS OF SEA ICE LOSS AND GLOBAL WARMING. THIS PROJECT WILL USE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY DRIFTING OBSERVATORY FOR THE STUDY OF ARCTIC CLIMATE (MOSAIC) FIELD CAMPAIGN (OCT 2019 - SEPT 2020) TO IMPROVE KEY PARAMETERIZATIONS FOR SIMULATING SEA ICE PHYSICS AND FEEDBACKS THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT, PROCESS-ORIENTED OBSERVATIONS TO ENHANCE THE PREDICTIVE SKILL OF CLIMATE MODELS.

THE PARTNERSHIPS INVOLVE THE VILLAGES OF EAGLE, NULATO, RUSSIAN MISSION, AND NUNAM IQUA WHICH SPAN THE HEART OF ALASKA FROM THE INTERIOR TO THE BERING SEA. WITH THIS PLANNING GRANT, INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY MEMBERS, ARTISTS, SCIENTISTS, MUSEUMS, AND EVALUATORS WILL DEVELOP PLANS TO CO-PRODUCE CONCRETE OUTCOMES, ENVISIONING: (1) INTERACTIVE COMMUNITY ART EXHIBITS BASED ON LOCAL AND INDIGENOUS PERSPECTIVES (2) EDUCATIONAL ART EXPERIENCES AT ANCHORAGE MUSEUM?S NORTHERN PERSPECTIVES FESTIVAL, AND (3) A STEM EDUCATION PROGRAM FEATURING K-ADULT CURRICULA. THE PLANNING PROCESS WILL BUILD CRITICAL PARTNERSHIPS REQUIRED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A VIABLE CO-PRODUCTION MODEL ROOTED IN EQUITY AND INCLUSION. THIS PLANNING GRANT WILL SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF TANGIBLE FRAMEWORKS AIMED AT STORIES THROUGH PHOTOGRAPHY, SOUND, VIDEO, AND DOCUMENTARY METHODS IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN MULTIPLE WAYS OF KNOWING AND TO EXAMINE, SUPPORT, AND EMPOWER MULTIPLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS, ELDERS, AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE. THE GOAL OF COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES, SCIENTISTS AND MUSEUMS IS TO PROVIDE RAPID DISSEMINATION OF ONGOING RESEARCH STUDIES AND HIGHLIGHT THE CO-PRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE FOR MORE EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATING THIS INVALUABLE WORK TO THE PUBLIC. BEYOND ICE WILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDE YUKON ARCTIC INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES WITH A PLATFORM TO SHARE INDIGENOUS PERSPECTIVES BEYOND THEIR BORDERS. BEYOND ICE?S INCLUSIVE PROCESS SUPPORTS MULTIPLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS, ELDERS, AND YOUNG PEOPLE, EMPOWERING EACH TO ENGAGE IN THE CO-PRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE HIGHLIGHTING INDIGENOUS OBSERVATION OF THE CHANGING ARCTIC.

HUMANS HAVE CAUSED AN ALMOST THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN METHANE SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. AS THE PLANET WARMS, CHANGES ON THE EARTH SURFACE AND IN THE ATMOSPHERE WILL FURTHER CHANGE METHANE LEVELS. HOW THESE FEEDBACKS WILL CHANGE OVER TIME IS NOT WELL KNOWN. STUDIES OF PAST VARIATIONS IN METHANE, BY MEASURING ANCIENT AIR TRAPPED IN ICE, PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF THESE CHANGES AND HELP BUILD BETTER PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE CHANGE. IN THIS PROJECT RESEARCHERS WILL USE MEASUREMENTS OF DIFFERENT CHEMICAL FORMS OF THE CARBON AND HYDROGEN IN METHANE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND REASONS FOR PAST CHANGES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP LABORATORY MEASUREMENT METHODS FOR HYDROGEN ISOTOPES, USE THE DIFFERENT CHEMICAL FORMS OF METHANE TO UNDERSTAND THE CHANGES IN ATMOSPHERIC METHANE THAT HAPPENED WHEN PAST ICE AGES ENDED AND THE EARTH WARMED, AND USE UNIQUE, VERY OLD ICE SAMPLES (> 1 MILLION YEARS) FROM ANTARCTICA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CONTROLS METHANE LEVELS IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHEN CLIMATE WAS AS WARM OR WARMER THAN TODAY. DEVELOPING NEW METHODS INVOLVES TESTING AN EXISTING SYSTEM FOR PURIFYING METHANE FOR MEASUREMENTS OF HYDROGEN ISOTOPES BY MASS SPECTROMETRY. THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY OPERATIONAL AND CALIBRATED FOR CARBON ISOTOPES IN METHANE. NEXT, THE RESEARCHERS WILL MEASURE HYDROGEN ISOTOPES IN METHANE FROM SAMPLES FROM TAYLOR GLACIER AND ALLAN HILLS, ANTARCTICA, THAT COVER TWO TRANSITIONS FROM ICE AGES TO INTERGLACIAL WARM PERIODS. THESE DATA WILL BE USED TO CONSTRAIN WHERE THE METHANE INCREASE THAT HAPPENED AT THESE TIMES ORIGINATED, BECAUSE HYDROGEN ISOTOPE RATIOS ARE SENSITIVE TO THE LATITUDE OF THE METHANE SOURCE. FINALLY, THE RESEARCHERS WILL MEASURE BOTH CARBON AND HYDROGEN ISOTOPES IN SAMPLES FROM 1 TO 3 MILLION YEARS IN AGE FROM THE ALLAN HILLS BLUE ICE AREA IN ANTARCTICA. COMPARISONS BETWEEN THESE MEASUREMENTS AND EXISTING DATA FOR YOUNGER SAMPLES MAY REVEAL IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MIXTURE OF SOURCE TYPES THAT MAKE UP THE METHANE BUDGET IN THESE DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS. FOR EXAMPLE, PRIOR TO 1 MILLION YEARS AGO, THE APPARENT LACK OF LARGE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ICE SHEETS DURING GLACIAL PERIODS, AND RESULTING HIGHER GLACIAL SEA LEVELS, WOULD HAVE HAD IMPACTS ON THE GLOBAL WETLAND METHANE SOURCE. ADDITIONALLY, WARMER TEMPERATURES MIGHT HAVE INCREASED CH4 EMISSIONS FROM WETLANDS BUT ALSO INCREASED PRODUCTION OF THE HYDROXYL RADICAL AND METHANE DESTRUCTION IN THE STRATOSPHERE.

THE BLE LTER WAS ADDED TO NSF?S NETWORK OF LTER SITES IN 2017 AND CURRENT WORK REPRESENTS THE SECOND PHASE OF THIS LONG-TERM EFFORT. THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF NEARSHORE ECOSYSTEMS ALONG ALASKA?S NORTHERN-MOST COASTLINE. THE STUDY ADDRESSES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT CONTROLS AND SUSTAINS FOOD WEBS IN ARCTIC COASTAL WATERS AND HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALTERING THESE FOOD WEBS. THE PROJECT ALSO EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NEAR THE ARCTIC LAND-SEA INTERFACE. ESTUARIES ALONG THE BEAUFORT SEA COAST SUPPORT PRODUCTIVE AND BIOLOGICALLY COMPLEX ASSEMBLAGES OF BIOTA THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE INDIGENOUS RESIDENTS OF THE ALASKAN ARCTIC. THESE ASSEMBLAGES ARE INHERENTLY SHAPED BY EXTREME SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS YET ARE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGED BY SHIFTS IN SEASONALITY AS WELL AS OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE RAPIDLY WARMING ARCTIC. STUDIES BASED OUT OF UTQIAGVIK (FORMERLY BARROW), DEADHORSE, AND KAKTOVIK, ALASKA, ARE ADDRESSING HOW CHANGES IN SHORELINE EROSION, FRESHWATER INFLOWS, ICE COVER, AND OCEAN CIRCULATION OVER SEASONAL, ANNUAL, AND LONGER TIMEFRAMES INFLUENCE NEAR-SHORE FOOD WEBS, FROM BACTERIA TO TOP PREDATORS. THIS INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF RESIDENT AND ANADROMOUS FISHES AND MIGRATORY BIRDS THAT SERVE IMPORTANT CULTURAL AND SUBSISTENCE ROLES IN THE LIVES OF ALASKA NATIVES THAT LIVE ALONG THE ALASKAN BEAUFORT SEA COAST. WHILE THE PROJECT?S WORK ON FOOD WEBS INCLUDES COMPONENTS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES, COMPONENTS FOCUSING ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS HAVE BROADER SOCIETAL RELEVANCE. INPUTS OF ORGANIC CARBON FROM LAND TO SEA ARE INCREASING AS PERMAFROST (PERENNIALLY FROZEN GROUND) THAWS IN THE WARMING ARCTIC, AND THIS PROJECT IS STUDYING HOW DECOMPOSITION AND ASSOCIATED RELEASE OF GREENHOUSE GASSES FROM THESE INPUTS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL WARMING. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL AND BROADER STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. THIS PROJECT IS ALSO STRONGLY COMMITTED TO EDUCATION, INCLUDING GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT TRAINING, POST-DOCTORAL MENTORING, CONTINUATION OF POPULAR SCHOOLYARD ACTIVITIES IN KAKTOVIK, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW K-12 AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE (I?ISA?VIK) PROGRAMS IN UTQIAGVIK. ECOLOGICAL STUDIES SUGGEST THAT TEMPORAL FORCING IS CRITICAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CONTROLS FOOD WEB STRUCTURE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL AVAILABILITY OF SEASONALLY-DISTINCT RESOURCES IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR DEFINING TROPHIC LINKAGES AND MAINTAINING STABILITY AND RESILIENCE OF FOOD WEBS. THE BLE LTER IS USING LAGOONS ALONG THE ALASKAN BEAUFORT SEA COAST AS EXPERIMENTAL UNITS TO EXPLORE THIS CONCEPT. ARCTIC LAGOONS SERVE AS EXCELLENT TEST BEDS BECAUSE THEY EXPERIENCE EXTREME VARIABILITY IN SEASONAL CYCLES, WHICH ARE NOW SUBJECT TO RAPID DIRECTIONAL SHIFTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR OVERARCHING QUESTION IS: HOW DO VARIATIONS IN TERRESTRIAL INPUTS, LOCAL PRODUCTION, AND EXCHANGE BETWEEN LAGOON AND OCEAN WATERS OVER SEASONAL, INTER-ANNUAL, INTER-DECADAL, AND LONGER TIMEFRAMES INTERACT TO CONTROL FOOD WEB STRUCTURE THROUGH EFFECTS ON CARBON AND NITROGEN CYCLING, MICROBIAL AND METAZOAN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, AND TROPHIC LINKAGES? ARCTIC LAGOONS PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THESE INTERACTIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF FRINGING WETLANDS THAT OFTEN MODULATE LAND-OCEAN INTERACTIONS IN OTHER LAGOON SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, BARRIER ISLAND GEOMORPHOLOGY, WHICH EXERTS A STRONG CONTROL ON WATER EXCHANGE BETWEEN LAGOONS AND THE OPEN OCEAN, IS HIGHLY DYNAMIC IN THE ARCTIC BECAUSE SEA-ICE EFFECTS ARE SUPERIMPOSED ON THE EFFECTS OF CURRENTS, SEA LEVEL, AND WAVES. THUS, CONNECTIONS BETWEEN INPUTS FROM LAND AND LAGOON ECOSYSTEMS ARE MORE DIRECT, AND WATER EXCHANGES BETWEEN LAGOONS AND THE OPEN OCEAN ARE MORE VARIABLE THAN IS TYPICAL OF LOWER LATITUDE SYSTEMS. THE PROJECT?S STUDY SITES ARE IN ELSON LAGOON (WESTERN BEAUFORT), SIMPSON LAGOON AND STEFANSSON SOUND (CENTRAL BEAUFORT), AND KAKTOVIK AND JAGO LAGOONS (EASTERN BEAUFORT). THE BLE LTER TEAM CONDUCTS SEASONAL FIELD WORK DURING ICE COVERED, ICE BREAK-UP, AND OPEN WATER PERIODS AND DEPLOYS SENSORS FOR CONTINUOUS LONG-TERM MEASUREMENTS OF KEY BIOGEOCHEMICAL AND HYDROGRAPHIC PARAMETERS. THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES WATERSHED AND LAGOON ECOSYSTEM MODELING COMPONENTS. WHILE WORKING TO ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF FUNDAMENTAL ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES, THIS PROJECT PROVIDES A MUCH-NEEDED MECHANISM FOR TRACKING AND UNDERSTANDING 1) HOW NATURAL CLIMATE CYCLES INFLUENCE COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS IN THE ARCTIC, AND 2) HOW CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS SUCH AS PERMAFROST THAW, SHIFTING PRECIPITATION REGIMES, AND LOSSES OF SEA ICE ALTER COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS.

OVER TIME, THIS MATERIAL IS TRANSPORTED ALONG THE SHORE (TO NOURISH BEACHES) AND/OR OFFSHORE (TO FORM DEEPER-WATER MUD PATCHES). SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF COASTAL EROSION OCCUR IN THE ARCTIC BECAUSE GROUND CONTAINING PERMAFROST THAWS EASILY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF WARM OCEAN WATER AND WAVE ATTACK. BUT ONCE THAT SEDIMENT ENTERS THE ARCTIC OCEAN, WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHERE IT GOES. STUDIES OF SEDIMENT TRANSPORT HAVE BEEN A CRITICAL PART OF COASTAL MANAGEMENT AND GEOLOGIC INQUIRY FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES BUT HAVE FOCUSED ON TEMPERATE AND TROPICAL ENVIRONMENTS NOT IMPACTED BY SEASONAL SEA ICE. WE HAVE A CRITICAL NEED TO EXPAND THESE STUDIES TO THE ARCTIC IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FATE OF SEDIMENTS, WHICH CAN RE-SHAPE COASTLINES, CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THE SEABED, AND TRANSFER NUTRIENTS FROM LAND TO OCEAN. THIS RESEARCH IS TIMELY IN LIGHT OF ACCELERATING COASTAL EROSION ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN SEASONAL SEA-ICE EXTENT AND INTENSIFYING WAVE ENERGY, TRENDS WHICH ARE FORECAST TO CONTINUE. THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY PATHWAYS OF SEDIMENTS IN THE COASTAL OCEAN DURING THE OPEN-WATER SEASON, WHEN FREQUENT WIND STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO MOBILIZE SEDIMENTS RECENTLY DELIVERED TO THE SEABED. MEASUREMENTS WILL INCLUDE PARTICLE CONCENTRATIONS, SEDIMENT MIGRATION ON TIME SCALES OF SECONDS TO MONTHS, SEABED COMPOSITION, AND SEABED GEOTECHNICAL PROPERTIES. THESE DATA WILL BE USED TO MODEL HOW THE ALASKAN CONTINENTAL SHELF MAY EVOLVE OVER THOUSAND-YEAR TIMESCALES IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING SHORELINES AND WAVE CONDITIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL BE TACKLED BY A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS WITH FIELD, GEOTECHNICAL, AND MODELING EXPERTISE. NETWORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES, TRAINING OF GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND ENGAGEMENT WITH UNDERGRADUATES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA THROUGH CLASSES AS WELL AS PROGRAMS AIMED AT INTRODUCING STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ARE PLANNED. ACCELERATING COASTAL EROSION IS ONE OF THE CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE ARCTIC AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH INTENSIFYING WAVE CLIMATES DRIVEN BY ANNUAL REDUCTIONS IN SEA-ICE EXTENT. AT PRESENT, PARTS OF THE ALASKAN ARCTIC COASTLINE ARE EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE GREATEST RATES OF COASTAL EROSION WORLDWIDE. THESE RATES ARE ACCELERATING, REPRESENTING AN INCREASED SOURCE TERM OF SEDIMENT AND ASSOCIATED NUTRIENTS INTO THE COASTAL OCEAN. WHILE STUDIES OF CONTINENTAL SHELF DYNAMICS HAVE PROVIDED GREAT INSIGHTS TO SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AT TEMPERATE AND TROPICAL LATITUDES, WE KNOW RELATIVELY LITTLE ABOUT THE PATHWAYS OF SEDIMENT ON ARCTIC CONTINENTAL SHELVES. THESE REMOTE ENVIRONMENTS ARE SHROUDED BY ICE FOR UP TO NINE MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND EXPERIENCE UNIQUE PROCESSES LIKE ICE PRESSURE-RIDGE FORMATION, DISTURBANCE OF THE SEABED BY ANCHOR-ICE GROWTH, AND 'STRUDEL SCOUR' DURING BREAKUP. THESE PROCESSES CAN CONFOUND TRADITIONAL SEABED SIGNATURES OF SEDIMENT ACCUMULATION. THUS, THIS PROJECT PROPOSES TO PAIR MEASUREMENTS OF SEABED PROPERTIES WITH DYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS OF SEDIMENT FLUXES WITHIN THE WATER COLUMN DURING THE STORM SEASON TO DETERMINE THE KEY MECHANISMS AND PATHWAYS OF SEDIMENT FLUX. FIELD DATA WILL BE USED TO DRIVE MORPHOSTATIC AND MORPHODYNAMIC MODELS OF SHELF PROFILE EVOLUTION TO DETERMINE FEEDBACKS BETWEEN WAVE PROPAGATION, EROSION, AND CHANGES IN THE SHELF PROFILE OVER MILLENNIAL TIMESCALES.

THESE HIGH-RESOLUTION OBSERVATIONS WILL BE USED TO REFINE GLOBAL ESTIMATES OF ICE MELT BY LOOKING AT CHANGES THROUGH TIME. INITIAL TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED IN A LABORATORY SETTING BEFORE VALIDATION ON NATURAL LAKE ICE THAT IS VARIABLE IN ITS ACOUSTIC SIGNAL ATTENUATION PROPERTIES. IN EVERY PHASE, THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION WILL BE GUIDED BY NUMERICAL MODELING. THIS DEVELOPED INSTRUMENT WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE IN TERMS OF SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF ALL FORMS OF ICE WITHIN THE CRYOSPHERE FROM THE ARCTIC TO THE ANTARCTIC. WHILE POLAR REGIONS ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THEY ARE ALSO SOME OF THE LEAST ACCESSIBLE AREAS OF THE PLANET AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE. TO THIS END, NEW EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WILL BE DEVELOPED WITH THE HELP OF THE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TEAM AT THE TAHOE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH CENTER, WHICH WILL BE USED TO HELP BROADEN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN LAKE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. TO EFFECTIVELY MONITOR AND PREDICT CLIMATE-RELATED CHANGES, A KEY SCIENTIFIC NEED IN ALL DISCIPLINES OF THE UNDER-ICE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IS TO ACCURATELY MEASURE ICE ACCRETION AND MELT RATES AT THE ICE/WATER INTERFACE, THEN USE THAT INFORMATION TO GENERATE BETTER MODELS OF UNDER-ICE WATER CIRCULATION AND MIXING. HOWEVER, EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES ARE LIMITED BY THEIR IMAGING CAPABILITIES, MEASUREMENT RESOLUTIONS, AND BULKY SIZES, WHICH HINDER THEIR APPLICATIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY. TO ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A NEW METAMATERIAL-ENHANCED ACOUSTIC PHASED ARRAY (MEAPA) SYSTEM AND TO EXPLORE THE APPLICATION OF THIS SYSTEM FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION ESTIMATIONS OF ICE MELT. GRADED INDEX ACOUSTIC METAMATERIALS WILL BE INVESTIGATED TO PROVIDE IMPROVED FOCUSING, BEAM STEERING, AND COLLIMATION PROPERTIES TO ACHIEVE HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING (SUBWAVELENGTH RESOLUTION) IN THINNER ICE AND TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE DETECTION RANGE OF THE MEAPA SYSTEM IN THICKER ICE. THE DEVELOPED MEAPA SYSTEM WILL BE CHARACTERIZED AND VALIDATED IN LABORATORY AND FIELD SETTINGS. THEN, IT WILL BE USED TO BETTER PARAMETERIZE BOTTOM ROUGHNESS, AND THE DATA WILL BE COUPLED TO BOUNDARY LAYER DYNAMICS OBSERVATIONS OF LAKE ICE IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS. COUPLING THE ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INSTRUMENT WITH THE SCIENTIFIC NEED OF THE POLAR ICE COMMUNITY WILL INFORM SUBGRID PROCESSES OF GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS (GCM) FOR POLAR REGIONS.

AS A RESULT OF THIS WARMING, PLANTS IN ARCTIC LANDS ARE CHANGING. IN SOME PLACES, PLANTS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WARMER CONDITIONS AND GROWING LARGER OR SPREADING ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. FOR EXAMPLE, SHRUBS MAY BE INCREASING IN HEIGHT AND GROWING IN AREAS THAT USED TO CONTAIN ONLY GRASSES, OR GRASSES MAY BE GROWING TALLER. ARCTIC WARMING IS ALSO RESULTING IN MORE WILDFIRES, WHICH REMOVE PLANTS AND CREATE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS FOR NEW PLANTS TO GROW.

THIS RESEARCH WILL ALSO HELP ESTABLISH NEW METHODS FOR USING DRONE DATA AND COMPUTER SCIENCE TOOLS TO MAP PLANT PROCESSES IN FINE DETAIL THAT CAN BE USED IN OTHER REGIONS. THE PROJECT WILL ALLOW A COLLEGE PROFESSOR TO DEVELOP NEW RESEARCH SKILLS AND NEW TEACHING MATERIALS AND PROVIDE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATE COLLEGE STUDENTS. RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT WILL BE SHARED THROUGH SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL ARTICLES, AND DATA AND CLASS MATERIALS WILL BE SHARED PUBLICLY ON THE INTERNET. AS THE ARCTIC WARMS NEARLY FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE PLANET, A WIDE RANGE OF ECOSYSTEM CHANGES ARE OCCURRING. BESIDES GENERAL INCREASES IN PLANT PRODUCTIVITY, CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES HAVE ALSO BEEN OBSERVED. FOR EXAMPLE, IN TUNDRA ECOSYSTEMS SHRUBS MAY BE EXPANDING INTO GRASS-DOMINATED AREAS, WHILE ELSEWHERE GRASS PRODUCTIVITY MAY BE INCREASING WITHOUT EXPANSION OF SHRUBS. LARGER AND MORE INTENSE WILDFIRES WITH WARMING MAY BE CHANGING PATTERNS OF VEGETATION RECOVERY POST-FIRE. SATELLITE IMAGES ARE A USEFUL TOOL FOR OBSERVING AND MONITORING THESE TYPES OF CHANGES. HOWEVER, THE RESOLUTION OF THESE IMAGES IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF VEGETATION CHANGE THAT ARE OCCURRING, WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE NATURE OF THESE CHANGES WILL DETERMINE THEIR IMPACTS ON GLOBAL CLIMATE. IN THIS PROJECT, THE INVESTIGATORS WILL COMBINE HIGH RESOLUTION DRONE IMAGES WITH CUTTING-EDGE MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS TO MAP VARIATION IN ARCTIC VEGETATION AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL PLANTS. USING AN ARCHIVE OF DRONE IMAGES FROM ACROSS THE ARCTIC, THE INVESTIGATORS WILL MAP THE DISTRIBUTION OF SHRUBS AND GRASSES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RESPECTIVE CHANGES, AS WELL AS HOW THEY AFFECT SATELLITE ESTIMATES OF ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY. USING A SECOND ARCHIVE, WE WILL MAP LIVE AND DEAD TREES AND SHRUBS IN AREAS AFFECTED BY WILDFIRE TO DETERMINE HOW VEGETATION REGROWTH AFTER FIRE VARIES IN NORTHEASTERN SIBERIA. THESE MAPS WILL HELP INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES DRIVING ARCTIC VEGETATION CHANGE, AND AID INTERPRETATION OF CHANGES INFERRED FROM SATELLITE IMAGES. THE RESULTS WILL AID OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ARCTIC VEGETATION FEEDBACKS TO GLOBAL CLIMATE. THE COMBINATION OF DRONE IMAGERY AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS WILL DEVELOP AND REFINE METHODS FOR STUDYING FINE SCALE VEGETATION DYNAMICS THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED IN OTHER REGIONS AND ECOSYSTEMS. THE PROJECT WILL ENABLE A MID-CAREER COLLEGE PROFESSOR TO DEVELOP NEW ANALYTICAL EXPERTISE AND SKILLS, AND NEW TEACHING MATERIALS TO INCORPORATE IN UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES FOCUSED ON GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT WILL BE PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS, AND THE RESULTING DATA SETS AND TEACHING MATERIALS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN FREELY ACCESSIBLE ONLINE REPOSITORIES.

AT PRESENT, NO SINGLE EQUATION ADEQUATELY DESCRIBES THE CHANGING ICE-OCEAN BOUNDARY, WHICH POSES PROBLEMS FOR COUPLING ICE SHEET MODELS TO CLIMATE MODELS. THIS PROJECT WILL IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE VARIABLES THAT INFLUENCE THE ICE-OCEAN BOUNDARY MAY CHANGE OVER TIME AND SPACE USING MACHINE LEARNING TO SEARCH FOR RELATIONSHIPS AMIDST AVAILABLE DATA. THIS TECHNIQUE WILL ALLOW THE RESEARCH TEAM TO CATEGORIZE GLACIER TERMINUS BEHAVIOR AND IDENTIFY THE RELEVANT PARAMETERS FORCING CHANGE FOR A PARTICULAR GLACIER AROUND THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET. RESULTS OF THE MACHINE LEARNING EXERCISE WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP AN EQUATION TO REPRESENT ICE-OCEAN INTERACTIONS IN AN ICE SHEET MODEL WHICH WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE FUTURE CHANGES TO THE ICE SHEET FORCED BY THE OCEAN INTO THE FUTURE. MODELS OF FUTURE ICE SHEET CHANGE YIELD RELIABLE FORECASTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE ONLY WHEN ALL THE CRITICAL PROCESSES CONTROLLING ICE SHEET EVOLUTION ARE APPROPRIATELY ACCOUNTED FOR. HOWEVER, MANY PHYSICAL PROCESSES ARE CURRENTLY POORLY UNDERSTOOD. ONE SUCH PROCESS IS ABLATION (ICEBERG CALVING AND SUBMARINE MELT) AT THE TERMINUS OF OUTLET GLACIERS, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE DOMINANT CONTROL ON MASS CHANGE AT PARTICULAR GLACIERS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IMPROVE MODEL FORECASTS OF SEA-LEVEL FROM GREENLAND BY USING MACHINE LEARNING ANALYSES OF GLACIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS TO INFORM PHYSICS-BASED MODELING OF OUTLET GLACIERS, WITH A FOCUS ON THE ICE-OCEAN BOUNDARY. MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT CONTROLS CHANGES IN TERMINUS POSITION OVER A RANGE OF TIME SCALES FOR ALL GLACIERS IN GREENLAND OVER A PERIOD OF PRONOUNCED HISTORICAL CHANGE (THE SATELLITE ERA). ANALYSIS OF THE MODEL PERFORMANCE WILL ENABLE THE RESEARCH TEAM TO DETERMINE THE DOMINANT CONTROLS ON TERMINUS POSITION FOR INDIVIDUAL AND GROUPS OF GLACIERS AND TO TEST HOW WELL THE MODEL PERFORMS AS NEW GLACIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATA BECOME AVAILABLE. THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL OF TERMINUS POSITIONS WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE PROJECTIONS OF OUTLET GLACIER MASS CHANGE USING A PHYSICALLY-BASED NUMERICAL ICE FLOW MODEL. THE TEAM WILL EXAMINE HOW ROBUST MODEL PREDICTION IS ON VARIOUS TIME-SCALES AS MORE AND MORE DATA BECOME AVAILABLE OVER THE COURSE OF THIS PROJECT.

THE RESEARCHERS WILL TEST THIS BY COMPREHENSIVELY CHARACTERIZING THE EPIGENOMIC PROFILES VIA PATTERNS OF DNA METHYLATION IN WILD GENTOO AND AD?LIE PENGUINS USING CUTTING-EDGE HIGH-RESOLUTION GENOMICS TECHNIQUES. SPECIFICALLY, THEY WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER GENTOO PENGUINS EXHIBIT A GREATER DEGREE OF DIFFERENCES IN DNA-METHYLATION THAN UNDERLYING GENETIC DIFFERENCES, SUGGESTING SUCH EPIGENETIC VARIATION IS DRIVEN BY EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO IMPROVED CAPACITY FOR LOCAL ADAPTATION. THIS PROJECT WILL EXPLORE WHETHER EPIGENETIC POTENTIAL MAY BE SELECTED FOR IN INDIVIDUALS WHO DISPERSE TO NEW COLONY LOCATIONS BY COMPARING OLDER, ESTABLISHED COLONIES TO NEW COLONIES AT THE RANGE-EDGE. BY IMPLEMENTING CUTTING-EDGE EPIGENETIC METHODS IN WILD POPULATIONS OF GENTOO PENGUINS, THIS PROJECT WILL HELP ADDRESS ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL PLASTICITY THAT WILL IMPACT CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND DECISIONS ON MARINE PROTECTED AREAS (MPAS) ON THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA.

THAT?S TWICE AS MUCH CARBON AS WHAT?S IN THE ATMOSPHERE. IF JUST A FRACTION OF THAT MELTS, THE ESCAPING METHANE WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD?S LARGEST SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS AND WOULD SEVERELY IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE. WE KNOW THAT OVER THE LAST 20,000 YEARS, A QUARTER OF THE STORED ORGANIC CARBON IN ARCTIC PERMAFROST HAS BEEN FLOODED BY THE RISING, WARM SEAS. BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE REMAINING PERMAFROST AND ITS ORGANIC CARBON STORES WHEN WARMING CAUSES FURTHER SEA LEVEL RISE? HOW MUCH METHANE WILL BE RELEASED INTO THE OCEAN WATER AND THE ATMOSPHERE WHEN THE PERMAFROST IS FLOODED? ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE FLOODING AND THAWING OF ARCTIC PERMAFROST WILL LEAD TO OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND STRONGER ARCTIC WARMING. HOWEVER, COLLECTING DATA IN THE ARCTIC IS DIFFICULT. THAT MEANS WE DON?T YET KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE ARCTIC CARBON CYCLE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO SEE HOW COMPUTER SIMULATIONS AND MATH CAN HELP. THE PROJECT WILL GIVE US A CLEARER PICTURE OF HOW THE TEMPERATURE, SOIL, CHEMISTRY AND MICROBES OF THE PERMAFROST CHANGE TOGETHER WHEN IT?S FLOODED, AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE METHANE AS IT BUBBLES THROUGH THE WATER. THAT WILL HELP US FIGURE OUT THE ROLE OF ARCTIC PERMAFROST IN THE CARBON CYCLE, OCEAN CHEMISTRY AND CLIMATE WARMING, BOTH IN THE PAST AND IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AND FEATURE WORKSHOPS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF STUDENTS PURSUING STEM DEGREES AND CAREERS. IT WILL ALSO GIVE INSIGHTS THAT WILL GUIDE FUTURE DRILLING EXPEDITIONS, IMPROVE EARTH SYSTEM (CLIMATE) MODELS, AND ASSIST POLICY MAKERS. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE HOW FLOODING OF THE ARCTIC CONTINENTAL MARGIN CONTRIBUTES TO THE CYCLE OF METHANE INTO THE OCEAN AND ATMOSPHERE. ARCTIC PERMAFROST IS A SIGNIFICANT NATURAL RESERVOIR OF METHANE, A GREENHOUSE GAS THAT?S 84 TIMES MORE POTENT THAN CARBON DIOXIDE OVER A 20-YEAR TIMEFRAME. WHEN SEA LEVEL BEGAN RISING SHARPLY AFTER THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM, WARMER SEA WATER (AS WARM AS 10-15?) FLOODED THE ARCTIC AND RAISED THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PERMAFROST. THAT SIGNIFICANTLY DEGRADED THE PERMAFROST AND CAUSED WIDESPREAD GAS RELEASE ALONG THE ARCTIC CONTINENTAL SHELVES. HOWEVER, THE METHANE SOURCE, ITS CURRENT RATE AND MAGNITUDE, AS WELL AS FUTURE PROJECTIONS, HAVE NOT YET BEEN MODELED AND ARE NOT WELL CONSTRAINED. THIS PROJECT WILL COMPILE THERMAL, HYDROLOGICAL, MICROBIAL AND GEOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS THAT ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE ARCTIC CONTINENTAL SHELVES; THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC SET OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS TO CALCULATE THE UPPER AND LOWER LIMITS OF METHANE RELEASE FOLLOWING THE FLOODING OF THE ARCTIC CONTINENTAL SHELVES; THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL RESULTS WILL THEN BE SCALED UP TO PREDICT THREE-DIMENSIONAL PROBABILISTIC MAPS OF SEABED MICROBIAL METHANE EXCHANGE, AND CREATE FUTURE PROJECTIONS FOR THE U.S. BEAUFORT SEA AND THE LAPTEV SEA SHELVES. THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A SYSTEMATIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE COUPLED THERMAL, PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL AND MICROBIAL EVOLUTION OF THE ARCTIC PERMAFROST SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO WARMING. BY UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES, WE CAN ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ROLE OF ARCTIC PERMAFROST IN THE CARBON CYCLE, OCEAN CHEMISTRY AND PAST AND FUTURE CLIMATE WARMING. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AND DEVELOP AN EARTH SCIENCE-FOCUSED TRAINING MODULE FOR A K-12 OUTREACH PROGRAM. IT WILL SUPPORT A FEMALE SCIENTIST TO BUILD HER RESEARCH TEAM. IN ADDITION, THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP SPECIFIC TESTABLE HYPOTHESES THAT COULD GUIDE FUTURE DRILLING EXPEDITIONS, EARTH SYSTEM MODELING, AND POLICY MAKING.

THE LATTER OF THESE ? VISCOUS FLOW ? IS DEPENDENT ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING TEMPERATURE, STRESS, GRAIN SIZE, AND THE ALIGNMENT OF ICE CRYSTALS DURING FLOW TO PRODUCE A CRYSTAL ORIENTATION FABRIC (COF). HISTORICALLY, ICE FLOW HAS BEEN MODELED USING AN EQUATION, TERMED ?GLEN?S LAW?, THAT DESCRIBES ICE-FLOW RATE AS A FUNCTION OF TEMPERATURE AND STRESS. GLEN?S LAW WAS CONSTRAINED UNDER RELATIVELY HIGH-STRESS CONDITIONS AND IS OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE MOTION OF CRYSTAL DEFECTS WITHIN ICE GRAINS. MORE RECENTLY, HOWEVER, GRAIN BOUNDARY SLIDING (GBS) HAS BEEN INVOKED AS THE RATE-CONTROLLING PROCESS UNDER LOW-STRESS, ?SUPERPLASTIC? CONDITIONS. THE GRAIN BOUNDARY SLIDING HYPOTHESIS IS CONTENTIOUS BECAUSE GBS IS NOT THOUGHT TO PRODUCE A COF, WHEREAS GEOPHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS AND POLAR ICE CORES DEMONSTRATE STRONG COFS IN POLAR ICE MASSES. HOWEVER, VERY FEW COF MEASUREMENTS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON ICE SAMPLES SUBJECTED TO SUPERPLASTIC FLOW CONDITIONS IN THE LABORATORY. THIS PROJECT WOULD MEASURE THE EVOLUTION OF ICE COF ACROSS THE TRANSITION FROM SUPERPLASTIC TO GLEN-TYPE CREEP. RESULTS WILL BE USED TO INTERROGATE THE ROLE OF SUPERPLASTIC GBS CREEP WITHIN POLAR ICE MASSES, AND THEREBY PROVIDE CONSTRAINTS ON POLAR ICE DISCHARGE MODELS. POLYCRYSTALLINE ICE SAMPLES WITH GRAIN SIZES RANGING FROM 5 ?M TO 1000 ?M WILL BE FABRICATED AND DEFORMED IN A LABORATORY, USING A 1-ATM CRYOGENIC AXIAL-TORSION APPARATUS. EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT TEMPERATURES OF -30?C TO -10?C, AND AT A CONSTANT UNIAXIAL STRAIN RATE. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, 5% TO 99.99% OF STRAIN SHOULD BE ACCOMMODATED BY SUPERPLASTIC, GBS-LIMITED CREEP, DEPENDING ON THE SAMPLE GRAIN SIZE. THE DEFORMED SAMPLES WILL THEN BE IMAGED USING CRYOGENIC ELECTRON BACKSCATTER DIFFRACTION (CRYO-EBSD) AND HIGH-ANGULAR-RESOLUTION ELECTRON BACKSCATTER DIFFRACTION (HR-EBSD) TO QUANTIFY COF, GRAIN SIZE, GRAIN SHAPE, AND CRYSTAL DEFECT (DISLOCATION) DENSITIES, AMONG OTHER MICROSTRUCTURAL PROPERTIES. THESE MEASUREMENTS WILL BE USED TO DECIPHER THE RATE-CONTROLLING MECHANISMS OPERATING WITHIN DIFFERENT THERMOMECHANICAL REGIMES, AND RESOLVE A LONG-STANDING DEBATE OVER WHETHER SUPERPLASTIC CREEP CAN PRODUCE A COF IN ICE. IN ADDITION TO THE POLYCRYSTAL EXPERIMENTS, ICE BICRYSTALS WILL BE FABRICATED AND DEFORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE MICROMECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUAL GRAIN BOUNDARIES UNDER SUPERPLASTIC CONDITIONS. ULTIMATELY, THESE RESULTS WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE A MICROSTRUCTURAL TOOLBOX FOR IDENTIFYING SUPERPLASTIC CREEP USING GEOPHYSICAL (E.G., SEISMIC, RADAR) AND GLACIOLOGICAL (E.G., ICE CORE) OBSERVATIONS.

THE THWAITES GLACIER SYSTEM DOMINATES THE CONTRIBUTION TO SEA-LEVEL RISE FROM ANTARCTICA. PREDICTING HOW THIS SYSTEM WILL EVOLVE IN COMING DECADES, AND THEREBY ITS LIKELY CONTRIBUTION TO SEA LEVEL, REQUIRES DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IT HAS RESPONDED TO CHANGES IN CLIMATE AND OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS IN THE PAST. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A RECORD OF REGIONAL SEA-LEVEL CHANGE BY ESTABLISHING CHRONOLOGIES FOR RAISED MARINE BEACHES AS WELL AS THE TIMING AND DURATION OF PERIODS OF RETREAT OF THWAITES GLACIER DURING THE PAST 10,000 YEARS BY SAMPLING AND DATING BEDROCK PRESENTLY COVERED BY THWAITES GLACIER VIA SUBGLACIAL DRILLING.

RECENTLY, IT HAS ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED THAT COLD CLIMATE POPULATIONS MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE METABOLICALLY HEALTHY OBESITY BECAUSE OF COLD CLIMATE ADAPTATIONS THAT IMPACT BODY SIZE, SHAPE AND COMPOSITION, AS WELL AS METABOLIC FUNCTION. THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW COLD CLIMATE ADAPTATIONS AFFECT CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH AMONG INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL LIVELIHOODS THAT VARY IN COLD EXPOSURE AND OTHER FACTORS.

PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE ICE LOSS RELY ON MODELS THAT SIMULATE THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE OF THE ICE SHEET TO CLIMATE CHANGES. A KEY CHALLENGE IS CALIBRATING MODELS BASED ON OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE LAST FEW DECADES, IN PART BECAUSE ICE DYNAMICS ADJUST TO CLIMATE CHANGES OVER LONG TIMESCALES. PAST CLIMATE THEREFORE AFFECTS THE MODERN STATE. THIS PROJECT WILL USE A NUMERICAL ICE-SHEET MODEL AND LONG-TERM CLIMATE DATA TO SIMULATE GREENLAND ICE-SHEET CHANGES SINCE 1850, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE ICE-SHEET?S DYNAMIC ?MEMORY? OF CLIMATE OVER THE PAST CENTURY. ICE LOSS CONCURRENT WITH RAPID WARMING IS WELL DOCUMENTED IN RECENT DECADES, BUT A PERIOD OF RAPID ARCTIC WARMING ALSO OCCURRED IN THE 1920S-1930S. HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS, WHERE AVAILABLE, SUGGEST THAT THIS TRIGGERED THE RETREAT OF MANY GLACIERS ON THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET, BUT THEIR ONGOING ADJUSTMENT HAS NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED. WITH SIMULATIONS THAT FULLY ENCOMPASS THIS PERIOD OF EARLY CLIMATE FORCING, THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE FURTHER CONTEXT FOR RECENT OBSERVATIONS, AND WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS THAT WILL AID IN CALIBRATING MODELS FOR FUTURE PROJECTIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO TRAIN TWO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. THE MODEL SIMULATIONS WILL ENCOMPASS BOTH THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET AS A WHOLE, AS WELL AS CASE STUDIES ON SEVERAL OF ITS MAJOR OUTLET GLACIERS. SIMULATIONS WILL BE FORCED WITH CLIMATE REANALYSIS PRODUCTS THAT EXTEND OVER THE INDUSTRIAL ERA, ENABLING A REALISTIC TREATMENT OF SHORT-TERM VARIABILITY, INCLUDING THE RAPID WARMING OF THE 1920S-1930S. THE PRIMARY INTENDED DELIVERABLE WILL BE HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS THAT CAPTURE THE MAJOR PHASES OF MASS LOSS SUGGESTED BY LONG-TERM OBSERVATIONS. MODEL OUTPUT WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO AID BROADER EFFORTS TO INITIALIZE SIMULATIONS OF FUTURE MASS LOSS OF THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET.

THESE DATA HAVE PROVEN TO BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, STUDENT PROJECTS, AND OPERATIONAL FORECASTING; TO DATE, APPROXIMATELY 275 RESEARCH PAPERS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED AND NUMEROUS STUDENT DISSERTATIONS WRITTEN THAT HAVE UTILIZED ITP DATA. OVER THE DURATION OF THIS 5-YEAR AWARD, A TOTAL OF 18 ITP SYSTEMS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED, TESTED AND DEPLOYED IN THE ARCTIC ON CRUISES OF OPPORTUNITY WITH THE RESULTING DATA BEING MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND PRESERVED IN NATIONAL DATA ARCHIVES. IMPROVED FORECAST SKILL BASED ON THESE AND OTHER POLAR OBSERVATIONS WILL ALLOW MORE EFFICIENT PLANNING FOR RESILIENT COASTAL INFRASTRUCTURE, FISHERY AND RESOURCE EXTRACTION, NAVIGATION, SEARCH AND RESCUE ACTIVITIES AND DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CT-BASED ANALYSIS OF PARTICULARLY WELL-PRESERVED SPECIMENS, PREPARATION AND RESTUDY OF OTHER CRITICAL FOSSILS, AND QUANTITATIVE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLAGES OF THE FREMOUW FORMATION AND COEVAL STRATA FROM LOWER LATITUDES, WE CAN MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ANTARCTIC VERTEBRATE FAUNAS DURING THE INITIAL STAGES OF THE TRIASSIC. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS RESEARCH WILL 1) DOCUMENT PREVIOUSLY UNDESCRIBED SPECIES, 2) UNDERSTAND THE TAXONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL COMPOSITION OF FREMOUW VERTEBRATE (PARTICULARLY REPTILE) ASSEMBLAGES, 3) MAKE COMPARISONS TO SEVERAL LOWER LATITUDE ASSEMBLAGES, 4) MEASURE SKELETAL COMPLETENESS AND ANATOMICAL REPRESENTATION IN THE RECORDS OF SYNAPSIDS, TEMNOSPONDYLS, AND REPTILES, AND 5) ASSESS TAXONOMIC ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF THESE MAJOR TETRAPOD GROUPS ACROSS DIFFERENT LOCALITIES AND DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. THE PROBLEM OF ?DARK DATA,? OR MUSEUM RECORDS NOT ACCESSIBLE DIGITALLY, WILL BE ADDRESSED BY PROVIDING THE ANTARCTIC DATA GENERATED BY THIS RESEARCH TO SEVERAL REPOSITORIES AND ONLINE VENUES, INCLUDING IDIGBIO.

THEREFORE, THESE NEW RECORDS WILL PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ICE SHEET MELTING AND SURFACE OCEAN FRESHENING MIGHT BE IN THE NEAR-TERM (<100 YEARS) AND LONG-TERM (>100-YEARS) FUTURE. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: OCEAN WARMING AND ANTARCTIC ICE MASS LOSS OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES HAS RESULTED IN SURFACE FRESHENING IN THE ROSS SEA SECTOR OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN. SURFACE OCEAN FRESHENING IS LINKED TO SEA ICE EXPANSION, WHICH HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REGULATING GLOBAL OCEAN CIRCULATION AND IS HYPOTHESIZED TO BE A NEGATIVE CLIMATE FEEDBACK SLOWING ICE RETREAT. THE FORCINGS AND FEEDBACKS INVOLVED IN SOUTHERN OCEAN WARMING, ICE SHELF MELT, SURFACE OCEAN FRESHENING, SEA ICE GROWTH, AND DEEP WATER FORMATION REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF INSTRUMENTAL RECORDS.

THIS RESEARCH WILL EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SURFACE OCEAN COOLING AND OCEAN FRESHENING FROM GEOLOGICAL RECORDS RECOVERED ADJACENT, AS WELL AS FARTHER SEAWARD FROM THE ICE MARGIN. THESE RECORDS WILL PROVIDE KEY INFORMATION REGARDING THE ROLE IN SEA ICE EXPANSION DURING THE PROCESS OF DEGLACIATION. THE GEOLOGICAL RECORDS SPAN TIME INTERVALS WHEN CLIMATE CONDITIONS WERE SIMILAR TO PREDICTED FUTURE WARMING SCENARIOS. THEREFORE, THESE NEW RECORDS WILL PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ICE SHEET MELTING AND SURFACE OCEAN FRESHENING MIGHT BE IN THE NEAR-TERM (<100 YEARS) AND LONG-TERM (>100-YEARS) FUTURE. BROADER IMPACTS WILL INCLUDE TRAINING FOR UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS, DISSEMINATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS THROUGH THE TIME SCAVENGERS WEBSITE AND HANDS-ON COMMUNITY SCIENCE EVENTS, AND ENGAGEMENT WITH SCHOOL TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: OCEAN WARMING AND ANTARCTIC ICE MASS LOSS OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES HAS RESULTED IN SURFACE FRESHENING IN THE ROSS SEA SECTOR OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN. SURFACE OCEAN FRESHENING IS LINKED TO SEA ICE EXPANSION, WHICH HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REGULATING GLOBAL OCEAN CIRCULATION AND IS HYPOTHESIZED TO BE A NEGATIVE CLIMATE FEEDBACK SLOWING ICE RETREAT. THE FORCINGS AND FEEDBACKS INVOLVED IN SOUTHERN OCEAN WARMING, ICE SHELF MELT, SURFACE OCEAN FRESHENING, SEA ICE GROWTH, AND DEEP WATER FORMATION REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF INSTRUMENTAL RECORDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO: (1) GENERATE MULTI-PROXY PLIO-PLEISTOCENE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE AND MELTWATER RECORDS IN ICE-PROXIMAL AND ICE-MARGINAL SETTINGS DURING DEGLACIAL AND INTERGLACIAL INTERVALS FROM ARCHIVED SEDIMENT CORES OF ANDRILL AND-1B AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL OCEAN DISCOVERY PROGRAM (IODP) U1524, AND (2) EXAMINE THE EXTERNAL FORCING MECHANISMS AND ORBITAL PACING OF SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE AND MELTWATER VARIABILITY DURING THE PLIO-PLEISTOCENE.

SPECIES AT BOTH POLES HAVE INDEPENDENTLY EVOLVED WAYS TO DEAL WITH CONSTANT COLD TEMPERATURE, INCLUDING THE EVOLUTION OF ANTIFREEZE PROTEINS. UNDER FREEZING CONDITIONS, THESE COMPOUNDS ATTACH TO ICE CRYSTALS AND PREVENT THEIR GROWTH. THIS LOWERS THE TISSUE FREEZING POINT AND REDUCES THE CHANCE THE ANIMAL WILL BE INJURED OR KILLED. WHILE IT MIGHT SEEM THAT THE NEED FOR UNIQUE ADAPTATIONS TO SURVIVE IN POLAR WATERS WOULD REDUCE SPECIES DIVERSITY IN THESE HABITATS, RECENT EVIDENCE SHOWED HIGHER SPECIATION RATES IN FISHES FROM POLAR ENVIRONMENTS AS COMPARED TO THOSE FOUND IN WARMER WATERS. THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT COLD TEMPERATURES SLOW CELLULAR PROCESSES, WHICH HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO LOWER RATES OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION IN THESE SPECIES. TO DETERMINE HOW RATES OF SPECIATION AND MOLECULAR EVOLUTION ARE LINKED IN MARINE FISHES, THIS PROJECT WILL COMPARE THE GENOMES OF MULTIPLE POLAR AND NON-POLAR FISHES. BY DOING SO, IT WILL (1) CLARIFY HOW RATES OF EVOLUTION VARY IN POLAR ENVIRONMENTS, (2) IDENTIFY GENERAL TRENDS THAT SHAPE THE ADAPTIVE TRAJECTORIES OF POLAR FISHES, AND (3) DETERMINE HOW FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES SHAPE THE EVOLUTION OF NOVEL COMPOUNDS SUCH AS THE ANTIFREEZE PROTEINS SOME POLAR FISHES RELY UPON TO SURVIVE.

IN DOING SO, THIS RESEARCH WILL TEST WHETHER EVOLUTIONARY RATES ARE SLOWED IN POLAR ENVIRONMENTS, PERHAPS DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON CELLULAR PROCESSES. IT WILL ALSO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF POSITIVE SELECTION AND THE RELAXATION OF SELECTION ON GENES AND PATHWAYS, BOTH OF WHICH APPEAR TO BE KEY ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES INVOLVED IN THE ADAPTATION TO POLAR ENVIRONMENTS. TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC MECHANISMS BY WHICH EXTREME ADAPTATION OCCURS, RESEARCHERS WILL DETERMINE HOW GLOBAL GRADIENTS OF TEMPERATURE AND DISSOLVED OXYGEN SHAPE GENOME VARIATION AND INFLUENCE ADAPTIVE TRAJECTORIES AMONG MULTIPLE SPECIES OF EELPOUTS (FAMILY ZOARCIDAE). AN IN-VITRO EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH WILL THEN BE USED TO TEST FUNCTIONAL HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE ROLE OF COPY NUMBER VARIATION IN AFP EVOLUTION, AND HOW AND WHY MULTIPLE ANTIFREEZE PROTEIN ISOFORMS HAVE EVOLVED.

AS THE ARCTIC WARMS, SHRUBS ARE REPLACING OTHER PLANT SPECIES, ALTERING THE CARBON CYCLE. THE DRIVING MECHANISMS AND IMPACTS OF THIS SHIFT ON ARCTIC SOIL CARBON REMAINS UNCLEAR. THIS RESEARCH EXPLORES THE REASONS BEHIND THIS SHIFT BY TESTING THREE HYPOTHESIZED MECHANISMS THAT MAY EXPLAIN SHRUBS' COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN A WARMER CLIMATE. THESE HYPOTHESES INCLUDE INCREASED PHOTOSYNTHESIS, GREATER RESPONSE TO NUTRIENTS MADE AVAILABLE BY WARMING, AND LARGER GAINS FROM LONGER GROWING SEASONS. THE PROJECT EMPLOYS MATHEMATICAL MODELS, FIELD EXPERIMENTS, AND SURVEYS OF SHRUBS ACROSS ALASKAN TUNDRA LANDSCAPES TO TEST THESE MECHANISMS. THIS RESEARCH WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF VEGETATION CHANGES AND CARBON CYCLING IN THE RAPIDLY WARMING ARCTIC. RESULTS WILL BE SHARED VIA A PUBLIC-FACING INTERACTIVE WEBSITE AND INCORPORATED INTO K-12 AND COLLEGE COURSES. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH CHANGING CLIMATE ENABLES SHRUB DOMINANCE IN HETEROGENEOUS ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS. THE RESEARCH APPROACH COMBINES TRAIT-BASED MODELS OF COMPETING TUNDRA SPECIES INFORMED WITH FIELD EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS OF TEMPERATURE, NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, AND SNOWMELT DATE.

ATMOSPHERIC RELEASE OF CARBON HAS BEEN WELL-DOCUMENTED FOR DECADES; HOWEVER, WATER IS MORE DIFFICULT TO MONITOR AND ITS ROLE IN THE ARCTIC CARBON CYCLE HAS OFTEN BEEN OVERLOOKED. THIS RESEARCH WILL EXPLORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS THAT ARCTIC GROUNDWATER AND HEADWATER STREAMS PLAY IN LONG-TERM PERMAFROST CARBON RELEASE. BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE EMERGING ROLE THAT WATER PLAYS IN THE CARBON CYCLE IN A WARMING ARCTIC WILL HELP IMPROVE REGIONAL CARBON BUDGETS, QUANTIFYING THE AMOUNT OF CARBON LOST FROM THE LAND THAT IS EXPORTED VIA RIVERS IN A WATERSHED UNDERLAIN BY PERMAFROST.

WHEN THE ARCTIC WARMED AFTER THE LAST ICE AGE, MANY LARGE ANIMALS IN THE ARCTIC, LIKE THE WOOLLY MAMMOTHS, WENT EXTINCT. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW MAMMOTHS LIVED AND MOVED IN THE ARCTIC. RESEARCHERS WANT TO KNOW HOW MAMMOTHS MOVED AROUND AND IF THEIR MOVEMENT CHANGED DEPENDING ON THE ENVIRONMENT. DID THEY HAVE CERTAIN AREAS THEY ALWAYS WENT TO, OR CERTAIN PATHS THEY FOLLOWED IN THE ARCTIC? LUCKILY, MUCH CAN BE LEARNED FROM THE TEETH AND TUSKS OF MAMMOTHS. THESE ANIMAL PARTS CAN HOLD RECORDS OF CHEMICALS (CALLED ISOTOPES) THAT CAN TELL US ABOUT A MAMMOTH?S LIFE. IN THIS PROJECT, THE INVESTIGATORS WILL STUDY THE CHEMISTRY OF THE TUSKS AND TEETH FROM MAMMOTHS IN ALASKA. BY LOOKING AT CHANGES IN THE CHEMICAL MAKEUP OVER THEIR LIFETIME, RESEARCHERS CAN DETERMINE WHERE MAMMOTHS MOVED DURING THE PEAK OF THE LAST ICE AGE AND RIGHT BEFORE THEY WENT EXTINCT IN MAINLAND ALASKA. THE INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING WITH COLLABORATORS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA MUSEUM OF THE NORTH (UAMN). THE RADIOCARBON DATING OF THE MAMMOTHS AS PART OF THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO BE USED IN AN EDUCATION PROGRAM CALLED THE ?ADOPT A MAMMOTH,? PROJECT, WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH UAMN AND IS AIMED AT STUDENTS IN KINDERGARTEN TO TWELFTH GRADE.

SUBSTANTIAL CLIMATE WARMING AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN THE ARCTIC ARE RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT ALTERATIONS IN THE BIOGEOGRAPHY AND MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF ANIMALS, INCLUDING POLAR BEARS, CARIBOU, AND BEAVER. IN SOME CASES, THESE CHANGES ARE PROVING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY STRESSFUL, PUSHING SOME ANIMALS TO THEIR ECO-PHYSIOLOGICAL LIMITS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTINCTION. WOOLLY MAMMOTHS (MAMMUTHUS PRIMIGENIUS), AN ICONIC AND EXTINCT ARCTIC SPECIES, REPUTEDLY SERVED AS IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS. SOMETIME AFTER THE END OF THE LAST ICE AGE, WHEN CLIMATE WARMED AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGED, THEY WENT EXTINCT FROM THE ARCTIC LANDMASS KNOWN AS BERINGIA, ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER LARGE ANIMALS. NUMEROUS HYPOTHESES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR THE CAUSE OF THESE RELATIVELY RECENT EXTINCTIONS FROM THE ARCTIC BIOME, AND THESE HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DEBATED. DESPITE THIS RESEARCH ATTENTION, IT IS NOT YET CLEAR TO WHAT DEGREE MAMMOTHS WERE ABLE TO MITIGATE FLUCTUATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THROUGH MOVEMENT TO MORE PREFERABLE HABITATS AND/OR PERSIST IN CERTAIN HABITATS OVER THE LONG-TERM. THE OVERARCHING PROJECT GOAL IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER WOOLLY MAMMOTHS FROM ARCTIC ALASKA CONSISTENTLY MOVED BETWEEN A SERIES OF FREQUENTLY USED AREAS AND ADOPTED SIMILAR MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND ROUTES DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM (LGM) COMPARED TO AFTER THE LGM AS THE CLIMATE WARMED.

SPECIAL ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO WOMEN AND MINORITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE RESEARCH AND THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP NEW COURSE MATERIALS FOR SEVERAL CLASSES IN AI AT A HISPANIC AND MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTE. IN POLAR RADAR SOUNDER IMAGERY, THE DELINEATION OF THE ICE TOP AND ICE BOTTOM AND LAYERING WITHIN THE ICE IS ESSENTIAL FOR MONITORING AND MODELING THE GROWTH OF ICE SHEETS AND SEA ICE. THE OPTIMAL APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM SHOULD MERGE THE RADAR SOUNDER DATA WITH PHYSICAL ICE MODELS AND RELATED DATASETS SUCH AS ICE COVERAGE AND CONCENTRATION MAPS, SPATIOTEMPORAL METEOROLOGICAL MAPS, AND ICE VELOCITY. RATHER THAN DIRECTLY ENGINEERING SPECIFIC RELATIONS INTO THE IMAGE ANALYSIS THAT REQUIRE MANY PARAMETERS TO BE DEFINED AND TUNED, DATA-DEPENDENT APPROACHES LET THE MACHINE LEARN THESE RELATIONSHIPS. TO DEVISE INTELLIGENT SOLUTIONS FOR NAVIGATING THE BIG DATA FROM THE ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC AND TO SCALE UP THE CURRENT AND TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES TO BIG DATA, THIS PROJECT PLANS SEVERAL APPROACHES FOR DETECTING ICE SURFACE, BOTTOM, INTERNAL LAYERS, 3D MODELING OF BEDROCK AND SPATIAL-TEMPORAL MONITORING OF THE ICE SURFACE: 1) DEVISE NEW METHODOLOGIES BASED ON HYBRID NETWORKS COMBINING MACHINE LEARNING WITH TRADITIONAL DOMAIN SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND TRANSFORMING THE ENTIRE DEEP LEARNING NETWORK TO THE TIME-FREQUENCY DOMAIN. 2) EQUIP THE MACHINE WITH INFORMATION THAT IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE OR THAT IS HARD FOR A HUMAN OPERATOR TO CONSIDER SIMULTANEOUSLY, TO BE ABLE TO DETECT INTERNAL LAYERS AND 3D BASAL TOPOGRAPHY ON A LARGE SCALE. USING THE RESULTS OF THE FEATURE TRACKING OF THE ICE SURFACE IN RADAR ALTIMETRY, THE RESEARCH EFFORT WILL ALSO DEVELOP NEW DATA-DEPENDENT TECHNIQUES FOR PREDICTING THE ICE THICKNESS FOR FOLLOWING YEARS BASED ON DEEP RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS.

RADAR ECHO DETECTION IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH RADIO WAVES ARE RE?ECTED FROM AN OBJECT IN ORDER TO MEASURE ITS PROPERTIES, INCLUDING POSITION, DIRECTION, AND SPATIAL EXTENT. HIGH-ENERGY PARTICLES INTERACTING IN A DENSE MATERIAL LIKE ICE PRODUCE CASCADES OF CHARGED PARTICLES AND A DENSE CLOUD OF IONIZATION, WHICH RE?ECTS INCIDENT RADIO WAVES, ALLOWING FOR REMOTE DETECTION OF HIGH-ENERGY PARTICLES SUCH AS NEUTRINOS. SUCH RADAR ECHOES HAVE ALREADY BEEN OBSERVED IN A TEST-BEAM MEASUREMENT. THIS WORK WILL ESTABLISH THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THIS TRANSFORMATIVE DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY FOR NEUTRINOS WITH ENERGIES OF 10 PETA-ELECTRON-VOLTS (PEV) AND BEYOND. EXPANDING ACCESS TO SCIENTI?C THOUGHT AND ACTIVITIES AT A YOUNG AGE IS A KEY STEP TOWARDS EXPANDING GENERAL SCIENTI?C LITERACY AND TRAINING FUTURE SCIENTISTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS. THE NSF-SUPPORTED ASPIRE PROGRAM AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY FOR HIGH SCHOOL WOMEN WILL BE EXTENDED TO INVOLVE THE RADAR DETECTION OF METEORS. STUDENTS WILL DESIGN, CONSTRUCT, AND USE AN ANTENNA TO DETECT A FAINT RADIO SIGNAL, INSPIRING CURIOSITY AND CREATIVITY. THE FIRST INSTALLATION TO BE PLANNED WILL BE THE RADAR ECHO TELESCOPE (RET) FOR COSMIC RAYS (RET-CR,) WHICH WILL DETECT CASCADES FROM ULTRA-HIGH-ENERGY COSMIC RAYS (UHECR) AND DEVELOP THE TECHNIQUES FOR THE FUTURE RET FOR NEUTRINOS, RET-N. UHECR ARE WELL STUDIED AND MAKE AN IDEAL, IN-SITU ?TEST BEAM?. THE OPTICAL CHERENKOV DETECTOR ICECUBE HAS DETECTED NEUTRINOS ABOVE 1PEV, AND ITS UPGRADE WILL EXTEND THIS TO ~10 PEV.

MOST RADIO GLACIOLOGY RESEARCH PROJECTS ARE LIMITED TO WHATEVER AIRBORNE ICE-PENETRATING RADAR (IPR) DATA HAPPENS TO ALREADY EXIST IN THE AREA OF INTEREST. COLLECTING NEW IPR DATA IS A LONG AND SLOW PROCESS, USUALLY WELL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH TEAMS, ESPECIALLY IN RESOURCE-INTENSIVE ANTARCTIC GLACIOLOGY RESEARCH. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO FIELD-TEST AND VALIDATE TWO COMMUNITY-DRIVEN INSTRUMENTS THAT HELP ADDRESS THIS GAP IN ANTARCTIC RESEARCH: A SNOWMOBILE-TOWED RADAR AS WELL AS A UAV (UNCREWED AERIAL VEHICLE) SYSTEM. BOTH SYSTEMS ARE BASED OFF A COMMON SOFTWARE CONTROL SYSTEM AND SHARE THE SAME CODE AND POST-PROCESSING TOOLS. AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL, THIS CODE WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER AN OPEN-SOURCE LICENSE FOR OTHER RESEARCHERS TO USE AND ADAPT, ALONG WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING COMPATIBLE HARDWARE SETUPS FROM COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE PARTS, IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO STUDY GLACIERS AND ICE SHEETS AT HIGHER CAPACITY AND LOWER COST. THE SNOWMOBILE-TOWED RADAR WILL BE A MULTI-FREQUENCY, POLARIMETRIC CHIRPED RADAR SYSTEM DESIGNED TO ILLUMINATE THERMAL, MATERIAL, AND ROUGHNESS PROPERTIES AT THE ICE-BED INTERFACE. THE PEREGRINE UAV SYSTEM IS A CHIRPED RADAR WITH 56 MHZ OF BANDWIDTH BUILT INTO A SMALL FIXED-WING UNCREWED AIRCRAFT THAT PACKS AWAY INTO A SINGLE PELICAN CASE FOR RAPID SMALL-SCALE SURVEYS. THE VARIABLES TO BE MEASURED BY THESE SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL OBSERVATIONAL DATA FOR PROJECTING FUTURE BEHAVIOR OF THE ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET. THE PROJECT SPANS TWO YEARS AND INCORPORATES TWO SEASONS OF FIELD TESTING PLANNED FOR SUMMIT STATION, GREENLAND, DUE TO THE NEED TO TEST ON A THICK, COLD ICE SHEET AS WELL AS THE LOWER COST AND RISK OF SUPPORTING INSTRUMENT TESTING IN THE ARCTIC COMPARED TO ANTARCTICA. THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE FIELD SEASONS WILL BE USED TO INITIATE OR CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH RESEARCHERS INTERESTED IN INCORPORATING OUR INSTRUMENTS INTO FUTURE FIELDWORK OR ADAPTING OUR CORE RADAR SYSTEM INTO NEW INSTRUMENTS.

THIS VARIABILITY IS IMPORTANT TO HUMAN SOCIETIES, DRIVING THINGS LIKE EXTREME HEAT WAVES OR DROUGHTS. OVER EARTH?S LONG HISTORY, THE AVERAGE CLIMATE HAS CHANGED IN PROFOUND WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, 20,000 YEARS AGO, THE EARTH ON AVERAGE WAS ABOUT 5 DEGREES CELSIUS COLDER, AND LARGE GLACIERS COVERED PARTS OF CONTINENTS THAT ARE ICE FREE TODAY. WE KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE CLIMATE HAS CHANGED BECAUSE WE HAVE EVIDENCE FROM NATURAL ARCHIVES, SUCH AS THAT FOUND IN THE CHEMISTRY OF ICE THAT REMAINS FROZEN AT THE POLES. BUT HOW HAS THE VARIABILITY CHANGED? DOES THE VARIABILITY CHANGE WITH THE SAME PATTERN AS THE AVERAGE? HOW OFTEN DO EXTREME EVENTS - SUCH AS EXTREMELY HOT OR COLD TEMPERATURES - OCCUR AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE PAST? RECORDS OF THE YEAR?TO-YEAR OR DECADE-TO-DECADE VARIABILITY, SAY FROM 20,000 YEARS AGO, ARE EXCEPTIONALLY RARE. WE WILL USE CLIMATE RECORDS FROM VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION MEASUREMENTS OF ANCIENT POLAR ICE IN GREENLAND AND ANTARCTICA, OBTAINED THROUGH A PROCESS KNOWN AS ?ICE CORING?, TO STUDY THE INHERENT VARIABILITY IN EARTH?S CLIMATE AND HOW IT CHANGES OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME, EXTENDING BACKWARDS IN TIME UP TO 100,000 YEARS BEFORE PRESENT. THESE ASPECTS OF CLIMATE, THE VARIABILITY AND EXTREMES, IN ADDITION TO THE AVERAGE CLIMATE, CAN PROVIDE NEW CONTEXTS THAT HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR CHANGING PLANET. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MEAN CLIMATE AND ITS INTERNAL VARIABILITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF CLIMATE DYNAMICS. UNDERSTANDING THE DEPENDENCE OF INTERNAL VARIABILITY ON THE MEAN STATE IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE DETECTABILITY OF FORCED CHANGES IN CLIMATE AND, CRITICALLY, THE CHANGE IN LIKELIHOOD OF EXTREME EVENTS. INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY THROUGHOUT EARTH?S HISTORY, AS THE MEAN CLIMATE HAS UNDERGONE LARGE CHANGES, SUCH AS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM ABOUT 20,000 YEARS AGO, IS EXCEEDINGLY RARE. MOST PALEOCLIMATE ARCHIVES LACK THE DETAIL OR CONTINUITY TO RELIABLY RESOLVE ANNUAL, INTERANNUAL, AND DECADAL TIMESCALES FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS. WE WILL USE A SUITE OF FIVE EXTREMELY HIGH-RESOLUTION ICE CORE RECORDS OF WATER ISOTOPES, AS WELL AS IMPURITIES LIKE DUST, TO STATISTICALLY CATALOG VARIABILITY AND EXTREMES IN POLAR CLIMATE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE BACKGROUND MEAN STATE. WE WILL EXAMINE THESE RELATIONSHIPS OVER PERIODS OF STABLE MEAN CLIMATE, LONG TERM CHANGES IN GLOBAL MEAN CLIMATE, AS WELL AS ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE, AND PROVIDE AN UNPRECEDENTED ANALYSIS OF HIGH-FREQUENCY, HIGH-LATITUDE CLIMATE VARIABILITY. THE ANALYSIS WILL SPAN THE LAST GLACIAL-INTERGLACIAL CYCLE, EXTENDING BACKWARDS IN TIME UP TO A 100,000 YEARS INTO THE PAST. HIGH-FREQUENCY CLIMATE VARIABILITY HAS BEEN IMPACTFUL TO HUMANS AND SOCIETIES THROUGHOUT HISTORY. ANNUAL, INTERANNUAL, DECADAL, AND CENTENNIAL SCALE VARIABILITY HAS DRIVEN CHANGES IN HABITABILITY LEADING TO THE BLOSSOMING AND COLLAPSE OF PAST CIVILIZATIONS. EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS IN PARTICULAR AFFECT MODERN QUALITY OF LIFE, NATIONAL SECURITY, FOOD AND WATER AVAILABILITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (AMONG OTHER CONCERNS).

THE MAGNITUDE OF ICEBERG CALVING AND PATHS OF ICEBERGS WILL BE REVEALED USING THE FLUX, GEOCHEMICAL AND MINERALOGIC SIGNATURES, AND 40AR/39AR AND U-PB GEOCHRONOLOGY OF ICE-RAFTED DETRITUS. THESE PROVENANCE TRACERS WILL ESTABLISH WHICH SECTORS OF ANTARCTICA?S ICE SHEETS ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO COLLAPSE, AND THE TIMING AND PACING OF THESE EVENTS WILL BE REVEALED BY THEIR STRATIGRAPHIC CONTEXT. ADDITIONALLY, THE TEAM WILL WORK WITH ARGENTINE COLLABORATORS TO CONNECT THE MARINE AND TERRESTRIAL RECORDS BY STUDYING GLACIER RECORDS INTERCALATED WITH VOLCANIC FLOWS ON JAMES ROSS ISLAND. THESE NEW CONSTRAINTS WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH A STATE OF THE ART ICE-SHEET MODEL TO LINK CHANGES IN ICE DYNAMICS WITH THEIR UNDERLYING CAUSES.

SUCH ORIGINAL INFORMATION WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE RESILIENT PRACTICES IN COASTAL REGIONS TO FURTHER REDUCE LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. THE PLANNED INVESTIGATIONS WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO TRANSFORMING THE CAPABILITIES OF OWNERS, PLANNERS, AND POLICYMAKERS TO CHARACTERIZE RESILIENCE UNDER VARIOUS EXTREME EVENT SCENARIOS AND DETERMINE OPTIMAL ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE EDUCATIONAL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TRAIN A FUTURE GENERATION OF DIVERSE ENGINEERS WHO CAN PRODUCE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURES IN SERVICE IN THE FACE OF CALAMITIES.

TEMPERATURES IN THE REGION HAVE RISEN BY MORE THAN 3?C SINCE THE 1970S, THREE TIMES FASTER THAN THE GLOBAL AVERAGE. OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, THE ARCTIC HAS TAKEN THE ROLE OF A CANARY IN THE COAL MINE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT OUR ABILITY TO MONITOR THE ATMOSPHERE IN THIS HARSH AND REMOTE REGION IS STILL VERY LIMITED, AND OFTEN RELIES ON VERY EXPENSIVE MANNED FLIGHTS AND RESEARCH CRUISES. THIS IS IN CONTRAST WITH THE SITUATION IN THE OCEAN, WHERE AUTONOMOUS PLATFORMS HAVE PROVIDED A WEALTH OF OBSERVATIONS. THE RESULTING PAUCITY OF OBSERVATIONS IS HINDERING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ARCTIC EVOLUTION, AND OF ITS RELATIONSHIP TO LOWER LATITUDE WEATHER AND THE GLOBAL CLIMATE. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON OVERCOMING CURRENT CHALLENGES IN MONITORING THE ARCTIC ATMOSPHERE BY DESIGNING, DEVELOPING, AND TESTING A NOVEL OBSERVATIONAL PLATFORM AIMED AT PROVIDING AUTONOMOUS, CONTINUOUS ACCESS TO THE CENTRAL ARCTIC THROUGHOUT ALL SEASONS. THIS EAGER PROJECT SUPPORTS THE DESIGN, TESTING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AUTONOMOUS ARCTIC ATMOSPHERIC OBSERVING SYSTEM USING A NOVEL DESIGN OF BALLOONS CAPABLE OF MAKING MULTIPLE SOUNDINGS FOR EACH DEPLOYMENT. THE PLATFORM?S MISSION REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO: I) FLY ACROSS THE ARCTIC BASIN CARRIED BY THE PREVAILING WINDS WHILE PERFORMING FOUR, 1 KM SOUNDINGS PER DAY OVER THREE WEEKS; II) OPERATE WITHIN A TEMPERATURE RANGE BETWEEN -50?C AND +20?C; AND III) SURVIVE PRECIPITATION AND ICING. BY PERFORMING A SERIES OF BENCH TESTS AND TWO FIELD CAMPAIGNS, THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON VERIFYING THREE HYPOTHESES. FIRST, THAT THE PROPOSED MECHANICAL-COMPRESSION BALLOON DESIGN WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT MANEUVERABILITY AND ROBUSTNESS TO SURVIVE THE IMPACT OF INCLEMENT WEATHER. SECOND, THAT RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN SENSORS, SATELLITE MODEMS, AND HIGH-SPECIFIC-ENERGY BATTERIES, WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SAVINGS IN WEIGHT AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET THREE-WEEK FLIGHT TIME. THIRD, THAT A CONTROL ALGORITHM CAN BE DESIGNED TO AUTONOMOUSLY FLY SEVERAL PLATFORMS ACROSS THE ARCTIC IN AN ENERGY EFFICIENT WAY.

AS A RESULT, THERE IS A GROWING NEED TO ASSURE STRONG NATIONAL CAPABILITIES TO OBSERVE AND UNDERSTAND SUCH CHANGES AND THEIR IMPACTS, AND TO BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE NEW SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS INTO UNDERSTANDABLE, ACTIONABLE INFORMATION FOR A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS. FOUNDED IN 1958, THE POLAR RESEARCH BOARD (PRB) IS THE FOCAL POINT WITHIN THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES, ENGINEERING, AND MEDICINE FOR PROVIDING SCIENTIFIC ADVICE TO THE NATION ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE ARCTIC, ANTARCTIC, AND COLD REGIONS IN GENERAL. IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS, THE PRB WILL BUILD ON ITS LONG HISTORY OF WORKING CLOSELY WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES AND THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY, TO HELP THE NATION UNDERSTAND AND RESPOND TO THE CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE ARCTIC AND THE ANTARCTIC. THE PRB PROVIDES A FORUM FOR LEADING SCHOLARS, FEDERAL AGENCIES, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO EXPLORE NEEDS, CHALLENGES, EMERGING ISSUES, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLAR SCIENCE, INCLUDING AROUND COMPLEX AND CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES.

THE GIS HOLDS ENOUGH FRESHWATER TO RAISE SEA LEVEL BY 7.4 METERS (24 FEET) IF IT MELTED COMPLETELY. THUS, UNDERSTANDING HOW IT RESPONDS TO WARMING IS IMPORTANT. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE GIS VULNERABILITY BY STUDYING HOW THE GIS RESPONDED TO CLIMATE WARMING IN THE PAST. AT THE END OF THE LAST ICE AGE, ABOUT 20,000 YEARS AGO, THE WESTERN GIS MARGIN EXTENDED FARTHER INTO BAFFIN BAY, HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS WEST OF ITS PRESENT POSITION. BY 10,000 YEARS AGO, THE ICE MARGIN HAD LARGELY RETREATED TO WITHIN THE CURRENT COASTLINE. IT IS UNCLEAR IF A WARMING ATMOSPHERE, A WARMING OCEAN, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RETREAT. SEDIMENTS STUDIED ALONG THE WEST GREENLAND MARGIN AS PART OF THIS PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN THE TIMING, MAGNITUDE, AND RATE OF GIS RETREAT DURING THE DEGLACIATION.

THE STRONG NEAR-SURFACE ATMOSPHERIC WINDS THAT BLOW ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE PLAY A KEY ROLE IN CAUSING THE FLOW WITHIN THE SOUTHERN AND NEIGHBORING OCEANS.

THIS WILL BE THE FIRST RECORD OF PAST ATMOSPHERIC H2 PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE INDUSTRIAL ERA. THE RESULTS WILL REVEAL THE NATURAL VARIABILITY IN PALEO-ATMOSPHERIC H2 AND HOW IT RELATES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE RESULTING DATA WILL PROVIDE A BASELINE FOR ASSESSING HOW HUMAN ACTIVITIES HAVE INFLUENCED ATMOSPHERIC H2 SINCE THE PREINDUSTRIAL ERA. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL INFORM GLOBAL ASSESSMENTS OF HOW THE FUTURE HYDROGEN ECONOMY WILL AFFECT ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND CLIMATE. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE TRAINING FOR A POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. THE RESEARCH INVOLVES DRILLING A NEW ICE CORE AT SUMMIT, EXTRACTING AIR FROM THE SAMPLES IN THE FIELD, WITH SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS FOR H2, NE, AND CH4. PALEO-ATMOSPHERIC LEVELS OF H2 WILL BE INFERRED FROM THE OBSERVED H2/NE RATIO TO ACCOUNT FOR PORE CLOSE-OFF FRACTIONATION DURING FIRN AIR ENTRAPMENT AND POSSIBLE GAS LOSS DURING DRILLING/SAMPLING. THIS STUDY WILL GENERATE THE FIRST MILLENNIAL SCALE ATMOSPHERIC HISTORY OF H2 AND EXAMINE CENTENNIAL SCALE VARIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDIEVAL CLIMATE ANOMALY AND LITTLE ICE AGE. CLIMATE-RELATED VARIABILITY IN H2 IS EXPECTED BECAUSE THE MAJOR LOSS MECHANISM IS MICROBIAL UPTAKE IN SOIL, A PROCESS THAT IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. THE SUMMIT PALEO-ATMOSPHERIC H2 RECORD WILL THEREFORE PROVIDE NEW CONSTRAINTS ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING OF H2 AND AN IMPORTANT TEST FOR GLOBAL MODELS USED TO ASSESS THE CLIMATE SENSITIVITY OF FUTURE H2 EMISSIONS.

WHILE ENGLISH HAS MANY FREE MORPHEMES, THE ALASKA NATIVE LANGUAGE ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND/SIBERIAN YUPIK USES THE SECOND STRATEGY WITH VERY COMPLEX WORDS, OFTEN SENTENCE-SIZED. THESE PROPERTIES ARE KNOWN AS AGGLUTINATION AND POLYSYNTHESIS. RESEARCHERS WILL DOCUMENT CRITICAL STRUCTURES IN THE LANGUAGE, DIGITIZE EXISTING YUPIK MATERIALS, AND BUILD COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS TO HELP THE COMMUNITY AND OTHER RESEARCHERS. THE DATA FROM YUPIK ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO LANGUAGE SCIENCE, SINCE MANY OF THE PHENOMENA DISPLAYED IN THE LANGUAGE ARE RARE AND NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. CREATING COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR LANGUAGES WITH VERY COMPLEX WORDS, LIKE YUPIK, IS OF ADDITIONAL BENEFIT TO COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND LANGUAGE SCIENTISTS IN THAT IT HELPS RESEARCHERS IMPROVE COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR LANGUAGES LIKE ENGLISH. THE NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES ACT, PASSED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS IN 1990, ENACTED INTO POLICY THE RECOGNITION OF THE UNIQUE STATUS AND IMPORTANCE OF NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES. THIS PROJECT WILL BUILD AND IMPROVE TOOLS LIKE A MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYZER, A SPELLCHECKER, AND A SEARCHABLE DICTIONARY, OF VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY IN REVITALIZING THEIR LANGUAGE. GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BE TRAINED IN THESE METHODS, AND RESEARCHERS WILL HOLD OUTREACH MEETINGS WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE LANGUAGE COMMUNITY TO TEACH THEM IMPORTANT COMPUTER AND CODING SKILLS THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO BUILD FURTHER TOOLS. ALL DATA GATHERED WILL BE PERMANENTLY ARCHIVED AT THE ALASKA NATIVE LANGUAGE ARCHIVE. THE INVESTIGATORS, A COLLABORATION OF LANGUAGE AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN AND GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY, WILL UNDERTAKE THIS PROJECT. IT INVOLVES THREE INTERCONNECTED PARTS: DIGITIZATION OF EXISTING MATERIALS ON AND IN YUPIK FOR USE BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND RESEARCHERS; RECORDING AND ANALYZING THE SPEECH OF YUPIK SPEAKERS; AND WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO BUILD COMPUTER TOOLS FOR YUPIK AND TEACHING STUDENTS HOW TO DO SO. A SUCCESSFUL COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF YUPIK LINGUISTIC PHENOMENA HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR UNSUPERVISED AND SEMI-SUPERVISED METHODS IN MORPHOLOGY INDUCTION AND GRAMMAR INDUCTION BECAUSE THE TYPES OF MORPHOPHONOLOGICAL CHANGE ARE PERVASIVE, MUCH MORE SO THAN MODELS USED IN OTHER APPROACHES TO UNSUPERVISED MORPHOLOGY INDUCTION. THIS WORK IS LIKELY TO HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS REGARDING APPROPRIATE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF POLYSYNTHETIC AGGLUTINATIVE MORPHOSYNTAX. ACCESSING MATERIALS AT SEVERAL ARCHIVES, THE TEAM WILL SCAN THEM, AND CLEAN AND PROCESS THE SCANS SO THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE DIGITALLY AND SEARCHABLE. THIS WILL CREATE A DIGITAL CORPUS OF YUPIK MATERIALS FOR USE BY THE COMMUNITY AND FOR LINGUISTIC INVESTIGATIONS INTO GRAMMATICAL MOOD, TENSE, AND ASPECT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THESE COMPLEX MORPHOSEMANTIC CONSTRUCTIONS. THE DATA WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS BEING DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT, PROVIDING THE YUPIK COMMUNITY WITH ACCESS TO MODERN TOOLS LIKE SPELLCHECKERS, ELECTRONICALLY SEARCHABLE DICTIONARIES, AND ELECTRONIC BOOKS.

WE WILL USE RESULTS FROM THIS PROJECT IN AN INTERACTIVE EDUCATIONAL VIDEO GAME WE BUILD FOR CLASSROOMS AND THE MENDENHALL GLACIER VISITORS CENTER WHICH RECEIVES OVER 600,000 VISITORS PER YEAR. WE WILL TRAIN HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS TO USE THE GAME AND HELP WITH FURTHER GAME DEVELOPMENT. LASTLY, THIS PROJECT WILL PARTIALLY SUPPORT AN ANNUAL CULTURE CAMP WITH INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN ALASKA AND NORTHWESTERN CANADA WHERE STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING IMPACTS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES WILL BE DEVELOPED. THIS PROJECT WILL QUANTIFY SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN FIRN THICKNESS, DENSITY, POROSITY, WATER CONTENT, AND VOLUME CHANGE, ACROSS THE JUNEAU ICEFIELD (JIF) IN SOUTHEAST ALASKA AND NORTHWEST CANADA. WE WILL USE A RANGE OF OBSERVATIONS ACQUIRED DURING THIS PROJECT, PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED DATA, DATA ASSIMILATION, AND MODELING, TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF FIRN VOLUME CHANGE ON MELTWATER STORAGE, MELTWATER FLUX, AND DOWN-GLACIER IMPACTS FROM CHANGING MELTWATER PROCESSES. WE HAVE SELECTED THE JIF FOR THIS STUDY BECAUSE IT IS AN APPROPRIATE ANALOG TO THOUSANDS OF TEMPERATE GLACIERS ACROSS THE GLOBE EXPERIENCING FIRN LOSS AND THINNING. THIS RESEARCH WILL CHARACTERIZE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF MELTWATER AND MELTWATER MOVEMENT WITHIN FIRN OVER HOURLY-TO-YEARLY TIMESCALES AND CM-TO-KM SPATIAL SCALES, RESOLUTIONS RARELY ACHIEVED ACROSS ANY GLACIER SYSTEM. TEMPERATE FIRN IS POORLY CONSTRAINED AND DENSIFICATION MODELS OF FIRN DO NOT YET INCORPORATE EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS OF MELT. ADDITIONALLY, SPATIAL DATA ON FIRN THICKNESS, CHANGES TO FIRN VOLUME DUE TO GLACIER RETREAT, AND THE ASSOCIATED CHANGES TO FIRN MELTWATER STORAGE AND DOWN-GLACIER MELTWATER FLUX (THEREBY INFLUENCING DOWN-GLACIER ECOSYSTEMS), ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP TACKLE THESE CHALLENGES. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALASKAN AND CANADIAN GLACIERS ARE RETREATING FASTER THAN ANY OTHER GLACIER SYSTEM ON EARTH, SO WE EXPECT CHANGES IN FIRN MELTWATER STORAGE TO OCCUR. MELTWATER STORED IN FIRN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RAISE SEA LEVEL BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AND IMPACT DOWN-GLACIER TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

THIS PROJECT WILL CHARACTERIZE THE ROLE OF ARCTIC WETLAND PONDS IN REGIONAL LAND-ATMOSPHERE CARBON EXCHANGE, ESTIMATE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS OF CH4 TO THE ATMOSPHERE, AND ASSESS HOW THEY HAVE CHANGED OVER THE PAST 50 YEARS TO BETTER ANTICIPATE THEIR FUTURE ROLE IN ARCTIC CARBON CYCLING AND FEEDBACKS TO CLIMATE. THIS PROJECT ALSO HAS TWO MAJOR EDUCATIONAL COMPONENTS: (1) TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS TO DESIGN AND LEAD ARCTIC FIELDWORK INTENDED TO DEEPEN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ARCTIC SYSTEM AND (2) INCORPORATE VIRTUAL REALITY, DRONE SENSORS, AND MACHINE LEARNING INTO EDUCATION TO IMPROVE ENGAGEMENT IN STEM AND POLAR SCIENCES.

MOREOVER, SNOW ACTS AS A THERMAL BLANKET BETWEEN THE ATMOSPHERE AND UNDERLYING ICE, THAT LEADS TO IMPACTS ON FRESHWATER LAKE ECOSYSTEMS AND HAS SOCIOECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS GIVEN ITS CRITICAL ROLE IN TRANSPORTATION (E.G., ICE-ROAD DURATION) AND ICE-JAM FLOODING. THEREFORE, STUDYING THIS HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE IS CRUCIAL, ESPECIALLY WITH MODEL PROJECTIONS SUGGESTING A LOW-TO-NO SNOW FUTURE DUE TO PERSISTENT EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND GLOBALLY RISING TEMPERATURES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LARGE UNCERTAINTIES IN CAPTURING THE FINE DETAILS OF THIS CYCLE AND THE HYDROLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH MEASUREMENTS OF DISTRIBUTED BULK-SNOW CHARACTERISTICS IN IMPORTANT AREAS SUCH AS INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS. THESE OBSERVATIONAL GAPS LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY DEVELOP ROBUST MODELING AND FORECASTING TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVED RISK MANAGEMENT AND HAZARD MITIGATION PROPOSES. THIS CAREER PROJECT ADDRESSES THIS DATA NEED BY EQUIPPING A SMALL UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) WITH AN ADVANCED RADAR SUITE TO PRODUCE FINE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION MEASUREMENTS OF SNOWPACK PROPERTIES SUCH AS SNOW DEPTH, SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT, RELATIVE DENSITY, AND LIQUID WATER CONTENT.

HOWEVER, THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THESE PROCESSES AND HOW THEY INFLUENCE THE DISCHARGE, SOURCE, AND NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS OF WATER IN ARCTIC RIVERS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. TO CHARACTERIZE SHIFTING RIVER SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS AND BRIDGE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, THIS PROJECT WILL MEASURE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF THE WATER CYCLE IN PERMAFROST WATERSHEDS ACROSS A RANGE OF GLACIAL COVERAGES (INCLUDING GLACIER FREE) IN GREENLAND.

THIS PLATFORM INCLUDES PROGRAMS LIKE GREENLAND FIELD RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIGENOUS ALASKAN AND GREENLAND STUDENTS AND DEVELOPMENT OF ARCTIC WATER CYCLE FOCUSED COURSES. THREE IMPORTANT HYDROLOGICAL SHIFTS ASSOCIATED WITH A WARMER AND WETTER HIGH ARCTIC GREENLAND OCCURRED WITHIN THE LAST MILLION YEARS: 1) INCREASED FRESHWATER FROM GLACIER MELT; 2) DEEPENING ACTIVE LAYER (PERMAFROST THAW); AND 3) INCREASED PRECIPITATION. CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGES ARE LEADING TO AN ARCTIC GREENLAND MORE LIKE THESE PAST ENVIRONMENTS. A WARMER ARCTIC WILL LIKELY INCREASE ACTIVE LAYER DEPTHS, WHICH WHEN COUPLED WITH GREATER RAIN EXPECTED IN THE ARCTIC, COULD RESULT IN MORE FLOW THROUGH THE ACTIVE LAYER CONTRIBUTING TO RIVER DISCHARGE, BUT THIS REMAINS UNKNOWN. THIS PROJECT WILL MEASURE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF THE WATER CYCLE IN PERMAFROST WATERSHEDS ACROSS A RANGE OF GLACIAL COVERAGES (INCLUDING GLACIER FREE) IN HIGH ARCTIC GREENLAND. THESE DATA WILL CHARACTERIZE SHIFTING RIVER SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS AND PROVIDE CRITICAL FIELD DATA NEEDED TO CALIBRATE NOVEL NUMERICAL HYDROLOGICAL MODELS. THESE MODELS WILL THEN HELP TEST RIVER DISCHARGE HYPOTHESES GIVEN FUTURE ARCTIC CHANGE UNDER DIFFERENT CLIMATE SCENARIOS (E.G., MORE PRECIPITATION, DEEPER ACTIVE LAYER). THESE ANALYSES WILL HELP UNDERSTAND HOW INCREASED ACTIVE LAYER FLOW COULD MITIGATE THE HYDROLOGICAL IMPACT OF GLACIER RECESSION AND FUTURE TRANSITION TO ICE-FREE WATERSHEDS.

ARCTIC SEA ICE HAS DECLINED IN AREA OVER RECENT DECADES. OCEAN SURFACE WAVES ARE BECOMING MORE COMMON IN THE ARCTIC AS SEA ICE LOSS EXPOSES THE OCEAN SURFACE DIRECTLY TO WIND PRODUCING WAVES. SEA ICE FLOATS ON THE OCEAN IN PIECES CALLED FLOES THAT FLEX AND FRACTURE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF WAVES. ALTHOUGH WAVES TRAVELING INTO THE SEA ICE LOSE AMPLITUDE, WAVES PROPAGATE DEEPER INTO SEA ICE AS FLOES ARE FRACTURED INTO SMALLER PIECES AND ARE MORE WIDELY SPACED. SEA ICE THAT IS HIGHLY FRACTURED IS MORE PRONE TO SIDE MELT, THEREFORE FURTHER ENABLING WAVE PRODUCTION AND PROPAGATION, FLOE FRACTURE, AND SEA ICE RETREAT. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS AWARD IS THE FURTHERING OF WAVE-ICE INTERACTION THEORY AND DEVELOPMENTS TO AN EARTH SYSTEM MODEL THAT SIMULATES SEA ICE FLOES, OCEAN SURFACE WAVES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS. OBSERVATIONS WILL INFORM THE MODEL DEVELOPMENTS. CLIMATE SIMULATIONS WITH THESE MODEL ADVANCES WILL BE THE FIRST EVER TO TREAT SEA ICE AND WAVE INTERACTIONS. PREVIOUS CLIMATE SIMULATIONS HAVE GENERALLY SIMULATED TOO LITTLE ARCTIC SEA ICE DECLINE COMPARED TO MEASUREMENTS OVER THE LAST 45 YEARS. INCLUDING WAVE-ICE INTERACTIONS IN THE MODEL IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THE SIMULATION OF THE PAST, PRODUCE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED SEA ICE AND CLIMATE CHANGE OVER THE NEXT CENTURY, AND YIELD BETTER FORECASTS OF THE SEA ICE RESPONSE TO STORMS. THIS WORK HAS BROADER IMPACTS DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING PAST AND FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. FUTURE PROJECTIONS OF ARCTIC SEA ICE COVER, WARMING, SNOWFALL, AND SEA LEVEL RISE ARE NECESSARY TO INFORM POLICY DECISIONS. SIMULATING ARCTIC WAVES IN SEA ICE IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR WARNING COMMUNITIES ABOUT COASTAL EROSION AND HAZARDOUS COASTAL CONDITIONS.

THE DECLINE OF ARCTIC SEA ICE EXPOSES LARGER OPEN WATER AREAS IN THE ARCTIC BASIN AND SUBPOLAR SEAS, ENABLING GREATER PRODUCTION OF LOCAL WIND DRIVEN OCEAN SURFACE WAVES IN THE ARCTIC. IN ADDITION, THINNER, LESS CONCENTRATED, AND MORE FRACTURED SEA ICE FLOES PERMIT WAVES TO PROPAGATE DEEPER INTO THE SEA ICE PACK. SEA ICE FLOE ARE HEAVILY FRACTURED NEAR THE SEA ICE EDGE DUE TO WAVE-INDUCED FLEXURAL MOTION. FLOES ARE ALSO FRACTURED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SEA ICE PACK FROM SEA ICE DEFORMATION DRIVEN BY WIND AND CURRENT STRESSES. HEAVILY FRACTURED SEA ICE CAN ENHANCE LATERAL MELT, WHICH FURTHER ACCELERATES THE RATE OF SEA ICE DECLINE. OBSERVATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE WIDTH OF THE WAVE-INDUCED FRACTURE ZONE VARIES BY REGION AND SEASONAL AND EXTENDS UP TO A FEW HUNDRED KILOMETERS INTO THE SEA ICE. THE EVOLUTION OF THE SEA ICE COVER AND THE NEAR SURFACE HEAT EXCHANGE OF ATMOSPHERE AND OCEAN DEPEND ON THE GEOMETRIC DISTRIBUTION OF FLOES AND THE OPEN WATER SURROUNDING THEM. THE DISTRIBUTION OF FLOES HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THE SEA ICE STATE NEAR THE EDGE, WHERE OCEAN HEAT CONTENT TENDS TO BE GREATEST. OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A SINGLE LARGE STORM CAN CAUSE SEVERE FLOE FRACTURE AND MIX OCEAN HEAT UPWARD INTO LEADS, SUBSEQUENTLY ACCELERATING THE LOSS OF SEA ICE AREA. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS AWARD IS THE FURTHERING OF WAVE-ICE INTERACTION THEORY AND DEVELOPMENTS TO A PROGNOSTIC FLOE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF SEA ICE IN A WIDELY-USED SEA ICE MODEL. IMPROVEMENTS TO WAVE ATTENUATION IN SEA ICE WILL ALSO BE MADE TO A WAVE MODEL. OBJECTIVE METHODS TO ESTIMATE PARAMETERS DYNAMICALLY WHILE COMBINING MODELS AND OBSERVATIONS WITH DATA ASSIMILATION WILL BE EMPLOYED. CODE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE FLOE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION IN SEA ICE AND WAVE COMPONENTS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE COMMUNITY EARTH SYSTEM MODEL, IN FULLY-COUPLED MODE. SIMULATIONS WITH THESE MODEL ADVANCES WILL BE THE FIRST EVER TO QUANTIFY THE ROLE OF DYNAMICAL SEA ICE FRACTURE IN THE COUPLED CLIMATE SYSTEM. THE NEW DYNAMICS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE ARCTIC CLIMATE FEEDBACKS AND IMPROVE THE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY OF THE MODEL. INCREASED SEA ICE FEEDBACKS ARE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN SEA ICE LOSS DURING ARCTIC STORMS, WHERE WINDS ARE SOUTHERLY ON THE EASTERN FLANK OF STORMS. THE MODEL WILL PERMIT NEW FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ABOUT HOW SEA ICE FLOES EVOLVE IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. THIS WORK HAS BROADER IMPACTS DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING PAST AND FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE FROM RISING GREENHOUSE GAS CONCENTRATIONS AND OTHER CLIMATE FORCINGS.

THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT OF THIS PROJECT WILL EXTEND AN EXISTING STANDARDS-BASED CURRICULUM ON SEA LEVEL RISE THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES. THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH COMPONENT OF THIS PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR APPLYING TRANSIENT ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTERING TECHNIQUES TO A WIDE RANGE OF ICE SHEET MODELS, ENABLING THE SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF GLACIOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS WITH PHYSICAL MODELS. TWO INITIAL CASE STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON RECONSTRUCTING PAST GLACIER CHANGES AND USING THESE RECONSTRUCTIONS TO INITIALIZE FUTURE PREDICTIONS OF CHANGE AT SERMEQ KUJALLEQ (AKA JAKOBSHAVN ISBRAE) IN GREENLAND AND THWAITES GLACIER IN WEST ANTARCTICA. THE FINAL PART OF THIS PROJECT WILL ADD THESE DATA ASSIMILATION CAPABILITIES TO A CLOUD-BASED ICE SHEET MODEL WITH A BROWSER-BASED INTERFACE SO THAT IT CAN BE USED TO DIRECTLY ASSIMILATE DATA FROM A COMMUNITY REPOSITORY OF ICE SHEET OBSERVATIONS DURING SIMULATIONS OF PAST AND FUTURE GLACIER BEHAVIOR. THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT WILL DEVELOP A NEW HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM FOCUSED ON DATA-BASED EXPLORATION OF PAST AND FUTURE SEA LEVEL RISE AND ITS DRIVING PROCESSES, IN ALIGNMENT WITH EXISTING GEORGIA (AND NATIONAL) STANDARDS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND STATISTICS COURSES. THIS CURRICULUM WILL BE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH AN ATLANTA-AREA TEACHER AND AN EXPERIENCED EDUCATION RESEARCHER AT GEORGIA TECH, AND PILOTED AT A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL.

AS PERMAFROST THAWS, LIQUID WATER CAN MORE EASILY TRAVEL BELOW GROUND, INCREASING FRESH GROUNDWATER AVAILABILITY. FOR THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE ABOVE PERMAFROST, INCREASE GROUNDWATER AVAILABILITY IS BENEFICIAL AS GROUNDWATER IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONTAMINATION THAN SURFACE WATER. DESPITE THIS KNOWN LINK BETWEEN PERMAFROST THAW AND GROUNDWATER FLOW, PERMAFROST REGIONS ARE OFTEN EXCLUDED OR OVERSIMPLIFIED IN LARGE-SCALE GROUNDWATER STUDIES, CREATING A CRITICAL GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW CLIMATE WARMING WILL IMPACT WATER RESOURCES. THIS PROJECT WILL INTEGRATE DATA COLLECTED ACROSS PERMAFROST LANDSCAPES, NUMERICAL MODELS, AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES TO GENERATE A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK ON HOW WARMING AIR TEMPERATURES IN THE ARCTIC IMPACT GROUNDWATER AVAILABILITY. RESULTS WILL BE USED TO CREATE A PERMAFROST HYDROLOGY EDUCATIONAL MODULE FOR RURAL ALASKA NATIVE MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS AS PART OF THE ALASKA NATIVE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PROGRAM, TO PRODUCE A CHILDREN?S BOOK ABOUT HYDROLOGY TO INCREASE A CHILD?S SENSE OF SCIENCE IDENTITY, AND EXPOSE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT A PUBLIC PRIMARILY UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTION IN THE RURAL SOUTHEASTERN US TO PERMAFROST HYDROLOGY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW COURSES, COURSE MODULES, AND TRAINING UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. PREDICTING FUTURE GROUNDWATER AVAILABILITY IN THE ARCTIC IS COMPLEX DUE TO NONLINEAR AND UNCONSTRAINED FEEDBACKS BETWEEN PERMAFROST THAW AND BIOPHYSICAL CHANGES THAT AFFECT SNOW DISTRIBUTION AND GROUND TEMPERATURES, SUCH AS SHIFTING RAINFALL EXTREMES, SUBSIDING MICROTOPOGRAPHY, AND SHRUB EXPANSION. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, THIS RESEARCH WILL (1) DETERMINE THE ROLE OF BIOPHYSICAL CHANGES ON GROUNDWATER FLOW IN PERMAFROST, AND (2) QUANTIFY GROUNDWATER FLOW AND AVAILABILITY IN RESPONSE TO CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE PERTURBATIONS BY COMBINING STATISTICAL ANALYSES WITH AN ADVANCED GROUNDWATER-PERMAFROST NUMERICAL MODEL INFORMED BY EXISTING SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGIC AND REMOTELY SENSED DATA SETS.

THIS REPRESENTS A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT AA, WHICH HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO MUCH SLOWER PROCESSES SUCH AS SEA-ICE LOSS. THE PROJECT THUS WILL ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF AA AND ITS UNDERLYING PHYSICAL MECHANISMS, AND ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPE HOW WE VIEW THIS PHENOMENON.

DESPITE INTENSE SCIENTIFIC SCRUTINY, THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN DRIVING ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION (AA) REMAINS UNCERTAIN. MOST STUDIES TO DATE TO UNDERSTAND THESE PROCESSES HAVE FOCUSED ON LONG TIME SCALES (E.G., MULTIDECADAL AND LONGER). THIS PROJECT, IN CONTRAST, FOCUSES ON THE SHORT TIME SCALES OF AA. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT RAPID ADJUSTMENTS TO EXTERNAL FORCING ? WHICH ARE THE RESPONSE TO THE FORCING THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF GLOBAL MEAN SURFACE TEMPERATURE CHANGE ? ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE OCCURRENCE OF AA. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY ANALYZING A SERIES OF NEW AND EXISTING GLOBAL CLIMATE MODEL (GCM) SIMULATIONS. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE THE MOST SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION TO DATE OF THE ROLE OF RAPID ADJUSTMENTS IN AA, POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMING CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF AA AND ITS UNDERLYING PHYSICAL MECHANISMS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF RAPID ADJUSTMENTS MORE GENERALLY, INCLUDING HOW THEY DIFFER BETWEEN CO2 AND NON-CO2 FORCINGS, AND HOW THEY DEPEND ON THE METHOD USED TO DEFINE THEM (E.G., ?GREGORY?

THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE WITH A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED INSTRUMENT THAT CAN DIRECTLY MEASURE OCEAN TURBULENCE, WHICH HAS BEEN INFREQUENTLY USED IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN. PART OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO DEVELOP NEW METHODS TO INTERPRET THE DATA IN THIS UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT. ONCE THESE METHODS ARE DEVELOPED, THEY MAY MAKE LONG TERM MONITORING OF CHANGES IN ARCTIC TURBULENCE POSSIBLE. THE MOTIVATION DRIVING THIS WORK IS TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE WILL AFFECT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE OCEAN AND SEA ICE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL BOTH FOR ARCTIC COASTAL COMMUNITIES, WHO FACE A LOSS OF SEA ICE AND INCREASING COASTAL EROSION, AND FOR IMPROVING PREDICTIONS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE. THE PROPOSAL WILL SUPPORT THE EARLY CAREERS OF TWO FEMALE SCIENTISTS, AND WILL ALSO SUPPORT A COLLABORATION WITH THE BIRCH AQUARIUM TO DEVELOP AN EXHIBIT TO EXPLAIN ARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE TO A BROAD AUDIENCE. CLIMATE CHANGE IS DRAMATICALLY ALTERING THE ARCTIC OCEAN, INCLUDING THE MULTIDECADAL LOSS OF ARCTIC SEA ICE. UNDERSTANDING POTENTIAL FEEDBACKS BETWEEN SEA ICE LOSS AND THE WARMING ARCTIC OCEAN IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO PREDICTING AND MITIGATING FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. HERE WE PROPOSE TO USE AN EXISTING DATASET OF 264 PROFILES OF SHIPBOARD TURBULENCE OBSERVATIONS COLLECTED ON TWO ARCTIC OBSERVING NETWORK CRUISES TO ASSESS THE STRENGTH OF VERTICAL MIXING IN BOUNDARY CURRENT REGIONS OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN, AND QUANTIFY ANY CORRELATION BETWEEN THE STRENGTH OF MIXING AND TEMPERATURE OF BOUNDARY CURRENTS (WHICH HAVE WARMED IN RECENT YEARS); AND IDENTIFY REGIONAL PATTERNS IN MIXING ALONG THE ARCTIC SHELVES AND QUANTIFY ANY CHANGES IN MIXING RATES RELATIVE TO PRIOR STUDIES. WE AIM TO USE THE RESULTS TO BOTH IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ARCTIC OCEAN MIXING IN A WARMING CLIMATE AND INFORM FUTURE EFFORTS TO MONITOR CHANGES IN THE ARCTIC MIXING ENVIRONMENT. THESE DEPLOYMENTS REPRESENT SOME OF THE FIRST USES OF TURBULENCE INSTRUMENTS IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN WHICH CAN BE ROUTINELY DEPLOYED ON HYDROGRAPHY CRUISES, AND PROCESSING AND INTERPRETING THE RESULTING DATA WILL REQUIRE NEW METHODS DUE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ARCTIC OCEAN AND THE LOWER LATITUDE OCEANS WHERE THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE USUALLY DEPLOYED. ONCE COMPLETED, THIS ANALYSIS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN ARCTIC OCEANIC VERTICAL MIXING AND HOW THE VERTICAL TRANSPORT OF HEAT AND NUTRIENTS WILL EVOLVE IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. THE UNDERLYING OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ARCTIC CLIMATE AND ITS LIKELY TRAJECTORY IN TERMS OF VERTICAL MIXING RATES ALONG THE MARGINS. THIS AIM IS IMPORTANT REGIONALLY, AS ARCTIC COASTAL COMMUNITIES FACE A LOSS OF SEA ICE AND COASTAL EROSION, AND GLOBALLY FOR IMPROVING PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE CLIMATE. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROPOSAL IS STRUCTURED TO SUPPORT THE EARLY CAREERS OF TWO FEMALE SCIENTISTS, AND WILL ALSO SUPPORT A COLLABORATION WITH THE BIRCH AQUARIUM TO DEVELOP AN EXHIBIT TO EXPLAIN ARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGE TO A BROAD AUDIENCE.

COMBINED WITH THE LOSS OF SEA ICE, THE MOST EXTREME HEAT WAVE EVER OBSERVED TOOK PLACE OVER EAST ANTARCTICA IN MARCH 2022 AS TEMPERATURES CLIMBED OVER +40?C FROM CLIMATOLOGY. EXTREME EVENTS HAVE AN OVERSIZED FOOTPRINT IN SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS, BUT ALSO SERVE AS LITMUS TESTS FOR CLIMATE PREDICTIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL USE NOVEL TOOLS TO DIAGNOSE THE FACTORS THAT LED TO THE RECORD LOW ANTARCTIC SEA ICE EXTENT AND HEAT WAVE FOCUSING ON THE IMPACT OF WINDS AND OCEAN TEMPERATURES. CURRENTLY (JUNE 2022) ANTARCTIC SEA ICE EXTENT REMAINS AT RECORD LOW LEVELS FOR THE TIME OF YEAR, RAISING THE PROSPECT OF A LONG-LASTING PERIOD OF LOW SEA ICE EXTENT, YET ANNUAL FORECASTS OF ANTARCTIC SEA ICE DO NOT YET EXIST. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO CREATE EXPLORATORY ANNUAL SEA ICE FORECASTS FOR THE 2022-2024 PERIOD. THE EXTREME CHANGES OBSERVED IN ANTARCTIC SEA ICE EXTENT AND AIR TEMPERATURE HAVE QUESTIONED OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF ANTARCTIC CLIMATE VARIABILITY. MOTIVATED BY THE TIMING OF THESE EVENTS AND OUR RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ANALYSIS TOOLS, THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (R1) CAN LOCAL WINDS ACCOUNT FOR THE OBSERVED 2021/2022 SEA ICE LOSS, OR ARE REMOTE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) ANOMALIES A NECESSARY INGREDIENT? (R2) ARE SEA ICE CONDITIONS OVER 2022-2024 LIKELY TO REMAIN ANOMALOUSLY LOW? (R3) CAN A STATE-OF-THE-ART CLIMATE MODEL SIMULATE A HEAT WAVE OF COMPARABLE MAGNITUDE TO THAT OBSERVED IF IT FOLLOWS THE OBSERVED CIRCULATION THAT LED TO THE HEAT WAVE? THE MAIN APPROACH WILL BE TO USE A NUDGING TECHNIQUE WITH A CLIMATE MODEL, IN WHICH ONE OR SEVERAL VARIABLES IN A CLIMATE MODEL ARE NUDGED TOWARD OBSERVED VALUES. THE PROJECT AUTHORS USED THIS TOOL TO ATTRIBUTE ANTARCTIC SEA ICE VARIABILITY AND TRENDS OVER 1979-2018 TO WINDS AND SST ANOMALIES. THIS PROJECT WILL APPLY THIS TOOL TO THE PERIOD 2019-2022 TO ADDRESS R1 AND R3 BY RUNNING TWO DIFFERENT MODEL EXPERIMENTS OVER THIS TIME PERIOD IN WHICH THE WINDS OVER ANTARCTICA AND SSTS IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN ARE NUDGED TOWARD OBSERVED VALUES. IN ADDITION, WE WILL DIAGNOSE THE RELEVANT MODES OF ATMOSPHERIC VARIABILITY OVER 2019-2022 THAT ARE KNOWN TO INFLUENCE ANTARCTIC SEA ICE TO GAIN FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE 2022 LOSS OF SEA ICE EXTENT. TO ADDRESS R2, WE PLAN TO EXTEND THE MODEL SIMULATIONS BUT WITHOUT NUDGING, USING THE MODEL AS A FORECAST MODEL (AS ITS 2022 INITIAL CONDITIONS WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE END OF THE NUDGED SIMULATIONS AND CAPTURE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE OBSERVED STATE). WE EXPECT THAT IF CURRENT UPPER OCEAN HEAT CONTENT IS ANOMALOUSLY HIGH, LOW SEA ICE EXTENT CONDITIONS MAY CONTINUE OVER 2022-2024, AS HAPPENED OVER 2017-2019 FOLLOWING THE PREVIOUS RECORD LOW OF SEA ICE EXTENT IN 2016/2017.

ABOUT 34 MILLION YEARS AGO, WHEN ANTARCTICA BEGAN TO COOL, MOST SPECIES OF FISH BECAME LOCALLY EXTINCT. A GROUP CALLED THE NOTOTHENIOIDS, HOWEVER, SURVIVED DUE TO THE EVOLUTION OF ANTIFREEZE. THE GROUP EVENTUALLY SPLIT INTO OVER 120 SPECIES. WHY DID THIS GROUP OF ANTARCTIC FISHES EVOLVE INTO SO MANY SPECIES? ONE POSSIBLE REASON WHY A SINGLE POPULATION SPLITS INTO TWO SPECIES RELATES TO SEX GENES AND SEX CHROMOSOMES. DIVERGING SPECIES OFTEN HAVE EITHER DIFFERENT SEX DETERMINING GENES (GENES THAT SPECIFY WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL?S GONADS BECOME OVARIES OR TESTES) OR HAVE DIFFERENT SEX CHROMOSOMES (CHROMOSOMES THAT DIFFER BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES WITHIN A SPECIES, LIKE THE HUMAN X AND Y CHROMOSOMES). WE KNOW THE SEX CHROMOSOMES OF ONLY A FEW NOTOTHENIOID SPECIES AND KNOW THE GENETIC BASIS FOR SEX DETERMINATION IN NONE OF THEM. THE AIMS OF THIS RESEARCH ARE TO: 1) IDENTIFY SEX CHROMOSOMES IN SPECIES REPRESENTING EVERY MAJOR GROUP OF ANTARCTIC NOTOTHENIOID FISH; 2) DISCOVER POSSIBLE SEX DETERMINING GENES IN EVERY MAJOR GROUP OF ANTARCTIC NOTOTHENIOID FISH; AND 3) FIND SEX CHROMOSOMES AND POSSIBLE SEX DETERMINING GENES IN TWO GROUPS OF TEMPERATE, WARMER WATER, NOTOTHENIOID FISH. THESE WARMER WATER FISH INCLUDE GROUPS THAT NEVER EXPERIENCED THE FRIGID SOUTHERN OCEAN AND GROUPS THAT HAD ANCESTORS INHABITING ANTARCTIC OCEANS THAT LATER ADJUSTED TO WARMER WATERS. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP EXPLAIN THE MECHANISMS THAT LED TO THE DIVISION OF A GROUP OF SPECIES THREATENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS INFORMATION IS CRITICAL TO CONSERVE DECLINING POPULATIONS OF ANTARCTIC NOTOTHENIOIDS, WHICH ARE MAJOR FOOD SOURCES FOR OTHER ANTARCTIC SPECIES SUCH AS BIRD AND SEALS. THE PROJECT WILL OFFER A DIVERSE GROUP OF UNDERGRADUATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT THE EUGENE SCIENCE CENTER MUSEUM. THE EXHIBIT WILL DESCRIBE THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT AND EXPLAIN ITS RAPID CLIMATE CHANGE. IT WILL ALSO INTRODUCE THE CONTINENT?S BIZARRE FISHES THAT LIVE BELOW THE FREEZING POINT OF WATER. THE PROJECT WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE UNIVERSITY?S SCIENCE AND COMICS INITIATIVE AND STUDENTS IN THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT?S COMICS STUDIES MINOR TO PREPARE SHORT GRAPHIC NOVELS EXPLAINING ANTARCTIC BIOGEOGRAPHY, ICEFISH SPECIALTIES, AND THE SCIENCE OF THIS PROJECT AS IT DEVELOPS. AS ANTARCTICA COOLED, MOST SPECIES DISAPPEARED FROM THE CONTINENT?S WATERS, BUT CRYONOTOTHENIOID FISH RADIATED INTO A SPECIES FLOCK. WHAT FACILITATED THIS RADIATION? COYNE?S ?TWO RULES OF SPECIATION? OFFER EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY SPECIES DIVERGE: 1) THE DYSGENIC SEX IN AN INTERSPECIES HYBRID IS THE ONE WITH TWO DIFFERENT SEX CHROMOSOMES (I.E., IN HUMANS, IT WOULD BE XY MALES AND NOT XX FEMALES); AND 2) ?SEX CHROMOSOMES PLAY AN OUTSIZED ROLE IN SPECIATION?. THESE IDEAS PROPEL THE PROJECT?S MAIN HYPOTHESIS: NEW SEX CHROMOSOMES AND NEW SEX DETERMINATION GENES ASSOCIATE WITH CRYONOTOTHENIOID SPECIATION EVENTS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY NOTOTHENIOID SEX CHROMOSOMES AND CANDIDATE SEX-DETERMINATION GENES IN MANY NOTOTHENIOID SPECIES. THE PROJECT?S FIRST AIM IS TO IDENTIFY ANTARCTIC FISH SEX CHROMOSOMES, ASKING THE QUESTION: DID NEW SEX CHROMOSOMES ACCOMPANY SPECIATION EVENTS? KNOWLEDGE GAPS INCLUDE: WHICH SPECIES HAVE CRYPTIC SEX CHROMOSOMES; WHICH HAVE NEWLY EVOLVED SEX CHROMOSOMES; AND WHICH ARE CHROMOSOMALLY XX/XY OR ZZ/ZW. METHODS INVOLVE POPULATION GENOMICS (RAD-SEQ AND POOL-SEQ) FOR MORE THAN 20 ANTARCTIC CRYONOTOTHENIOIDS. THE PREDICTION IS FREQUENT TURNOVER OF SEX CHROMOSOMES. THE PROJECT?S SECOND AIM IS TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATE ANTARCTIC CRYONOTOTHENIOID SEX-DETERMINATION GENES, ASKING THE QUESTION: DID NEW SEX-DETERMINATION GENES ACCOMPANY ANTARCTIC CRYONOTOTHENIOID SPECIATION EVENTS? A KNOWLEDGE GAP IS THE IDENTITY OF SEX DETERMINATION GENES IN ANY NOTOTHENIOID. PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT THREE SEX-LINKED LOCI ARE IN OR ADJACENT TO THREE DIFFERENT CANDIDATE SEX DETERMINATION GENES: 1) A DUPLICATE OF BMPR1BA IN BLACKFIN ICEFISH; 2) A TANDEM DUPLICATE OF GSDF IN SOUTH GEORGIA ICEFISH; AND 3) A TRANSPOSED DUPLICATE OF GSDF IN STRIPED NOTOTHEN. METHODS INVOLVE ANNOTATING THE GENOMIC NEIGHBORHOODS OF CRYONOTOTHENIOID SEX LINKED LOCI FOR ANOMALIES IN CANDIDATE SEX GENES, SEQUENCING SEX CHROMOSOMES, AND TESTING SEX GENE VARIANTS BY CRISPR MUTAGENESIS IN ZEBRAFISH. THE PREDICTION IS FREQUENT TURNOVER OF SEX DETERMINATION GENES. THE PROJECT?S THIRD AIM IS TO IDENTIFY SEX CHROMOSOMES AND SEX-DETERMINATION GENES IN TEMPERATE NOTOTHENIOIDS. BASALLY DIVERGING TEMPERATE NOTOTHENIOIDS (?BASALS?) LACK IDENTIFIABLE SEX CHROMOSOMES, CONSISTENT WITH TEMPERATURE-CUED SEX DETERMINATION, AND ONE ?BASAL? SPECIES IS A HERMAPHRODITE. THE CONSTANTLY COLD SOUTHERN OCEAN RULES OUT TEMPERATURE, A COMMON SEX DETERMINATION CUE IN MANY TEMPERATE FISH, FAVORING GENETIC SEX DETERMINATION. SOME CRYONOTOTHENIOIDS RE-INVADED TEMPERATE WATERS (?RETURNEES?). KNOWLEDGE GAPS INCLUDE WHETHER BASALS AND RETURNEES HAVE STRONG SEX DETERMINATION GENES. METHODS EMPLOY POOL-SEQ. THE PREDICTION IS THAT GENETIC SEX DETERMINATION IS WEAK IN BASALS AND THAT RETURNEES HAVE THE SAME, BUT WEAKER, SEX-LINKED LOCI AS THEIR ANTARCTIC SISTER CLADE. A PERMANENT EXHIBIT WILL BE ESTABLISHED AT THE EUGENE SCIENCE CENTER MUSEUM TENTATIVELY ENTITLED: THE ANTARCTIC: ITS FISHES AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THOUSANDS OF VISITORS, ESPECIALLY SCHOOL CHILDREN WILL BE EXPOSED, TO THE SCIENCE OF ANTARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS AND THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

THERE HAS BEEN A PRONOUNCED DECREASE IN SUMMER SEA ICE COVER, AN OVERALL THINNING OF THE ICE, AND A LENGTHENING OF THE SUMMER MELT SEASON. SOME OF THE GREATEST CHANGES IN SEA ICE COVER ACROSS THE PAN-ARCTIC HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN THE CHUKCHI AND BEAUFORT SEAS SURROUNDING ALASKA, WHERE THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF PERENNIAL SEA ICE THAT PERSISTS YEAR-ROUND (INCLUDING DURING SUMMER). THIS PACIFIC ARCTIC SECTOR IS ALSO AMONG THE MOST BIOLOGICALLY PRODUCTIVE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS IN THE WORLD AND IS AN IMPORTANT REGION TO MONITOR FOR THE FLOW OF CARBON. ALTHOUGH SEA ICE IS A DOMINANT FEATURE IN THESE SHALLOW MARINE ENVIRONMENTS AT HIGH-LATITUDES, WE ARE ONLY BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHANGES IN SEA ICE COVER (THROUGH ITS INFLUENCE ON LIGHT, SEAWATER TEMPERATURE, SALINITY, AND NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY) WILL AFFECT ECOSYSTEMS IN THESE REGIONS. IN PARTICULAR, EARLIER ICE-FREE CONDITIONS IN THE SPRING (AS WELL AS LATER ICE-FREE CONDITIONS IN THE FALL) HAVE DISRUPTED THE TIMING OF ALGAE BLOOMS AND THE LIVELIHOODS OF MARINE MAMMALS FARTHER UP THE FOOD CHAIN. THIS RESEARCH IS FOCUSING UPON MEASUREMENTS OF LIGHT TRANSMITTANCE THROUGH THE OCEAN WATER COLUMN COLLECTED AT SCIENCE STATIONS DURING THE SYNOPTIC ARCTIC SURVEY (SAS) CRUISE ON THE US COAST GUARD SHIP HEALY. MEASUREMENTS OF LIGHT TRANSMITTANCE THROUGH THE WATER COLUMN WILL FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW LIGHT IMPACTS HEAT DISTRIBUTION, ALGAE GROWTH, AND CARBON FLOWS THROUGHOUT THE REGION. IN ADDITION, THIS PROJECT IS SUPPORTING AN EARLY-CAREER RESEARCHER AND THE TEAM IS CONTRIBUTING MATERIAL FOR NUMEROUS UNDERGRADUATE COURSES AND PARTNERING WITH THE GIRLS INC. ORGANIZATION TO INVOLVE MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN ABOUT ARCTIC OCEAN SCIENCE. THIS RESEARCH IS ESTABLISHING NEW MEASUREMENTS OF LIGHT TRANSMITTANCE (320?780 NM) THROUGH THE UPPERMOST ~30?50 M OF THE OCEAN WATER COLUMN AT OBSERVATION POINTS ACROSS A CONTINENTAL SHELF GRADIENT (OVER THE CHUKCHI SHELF INTO THE DEEP ARCTIC OCEAN BASIN, WITH THE RETURN SOUTHWARD OVER THE CHUKCHI BORDERLANDS). THESE MEASUREMENTS ARE PROVIDING THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND HOW LIGHT AVAILABILITY IN THE WATER COLUMN CHANGES SPATIALLY (ACROSS A ~2000 KM LONG CONTINENTAL SHELF/LATITUDINAL GRADIENT) AS WELL AS TEMPORALLY (ACROSS A SEASONAL GRADIENT FROM EARLY SEPTEMBER THROUGH LATE OCTOBER). USING THESE MEASUREMENTS, THE TEAM IS TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LIGHT TRANSMITTANCE INCREASES WITH DECLINES IN SEA ICE COVER AND VARIES WITH LIGHT ABSORBING IMPURITIES IN THE WATER COLUMN. THE SEASONAL TIMING AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE SAS CRUISE PROVIDE A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER ASSESS THE CONNECTIONS OF LATE-OPEN-WATER-SEASON LIGHT TRANSMITTANCE TO ALL THREE RESEARCH FOCAL AREAS OF THE SAS SCIENCE AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: (1) PHYSICAL DRIVERS, (2) ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES, AND (3) CARBON CYCLING.

THE ARCTIC IS ONE OF THE FASTEST WARMING REGIONS OF THE PLANET AND LONG-TERM OBSERVATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT NATURAL SYSTEMS IN THIS REGION ARE UNDERGOING SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES. OBSERVED CHANGES HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED IN THE PACIFIC ARCTIC, WHERE INCREASES IN OCEAN TEMPERATURE, DECREASES IN SEA ICE EXTENT, AND CHANGES IN CURRENTS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ALONGSIDE CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE IN SEDIMENTS ON THE SEAFLOOR. CHANGES IN THESE COMMUNITIES LIKELY WILL HAVE CASCADING IMPACTS ON FISHERIES AND SEABIRD AND MARINE MAMMAL POPULATIONS THAT RELY ON FOOD FROM THE SEAFLOOR. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXAMINE COINCIDENT CHANGES IN SEAFLOOR BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS AS RECORDED IN SAMPLES COLLECTED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES TO UNDERSTAND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES IN THE PACIFIC ARCTIC. IN PARTICULAR, THIS PROJECT WILL TEST HOW WELL OBSERVATIONAL DATA COLLECTED ANNUALLY FOR DECADES CAN BE USED TO MAKE FORECASTS OF HOW MARINE SYSTEMS ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. A SECONDARY GOAL IS TO ASSESS HOW WELL ONGOING SAMPLING EFFORTS MAY BE ABLE TO DETECT BIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THESE SYSTEMS. ECOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN THE PACIFIC ARCTIC ALSO WILL HAVE IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY FOR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON SUBSISTENCE HARVESTS OF WALRUSES AND BEARDED SEALS.

LASTLY, WE WILL SHARE RESEARCH OUTCOMES AND ACQUIRE SHARED KNOWLEDGE FROM INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE REGION. 2. BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES FOUND IN SEAFLOOR SEDIMENTS OF THE PACIFIC ARCTIC ARE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE, INFLUENCE ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES, AND ARE CRITICAL FOOD RESOURCES FOR MARINE MAMMALS AND BIRDS. THESE SEAFLOOR COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, AND RECENT OBSERVATIONS INDICATE SHIFTS IN TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN OCEAN TEMPERATURE, DECREASES IN SEA ICE EXTENT, AND CHANGES IN CURRENTS. CHANGES IN PACIFIC ARCTIC SEAFLOOR COMMUNITIES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE CASCADING IMPACTS ON SEABIRD AND MARINE MAMMAL POPULATIONS, ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, AND FISHERIES. HOWEVER, IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO EXPLAIN AND PREDICT RESPONSES OF ARCTIC MARINE SYSTEMS TO RAPID CLIMATE CHANGE REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGE. IN REMOTE, DATA-LIMITED ECOSYSTEMS LIKE THE ARCTIC SEAFLOOR, WHERE DIRECT OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION ARE DIFFICULT, CORRELATIVE MODELS ARE OFTEN USED TO LINK BIOLOGICAL PATTERNS TO ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS AND TO MAKE FORECASTS OF ECOSYSTEM TRAJECTORIES. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE PERFORMED RIGOROUS TESTS OF THE ABILITY OF THESE SO-CALLED ?SPACE-FOR-TIME SUBSTITUTION? APPROACHES TO PREDICT CHANGES IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, IN LARGE PART DUE TO A LACK OF CONTEMPORARY DATASETS WITH SUFFICIENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL COVERAGE. AT THE SAME TIME, WE LACK A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF THRESHOLDS, WHERE INCREMENTAL CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT RESULT IN SUDDEN AND FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, IN DRIVING BIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. TO ADDRESS THESE HURDLES, THIS PROJECT WILL (1) ANALYZE MULTI-DECADAL TIME SERIES OF PAIRED BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL OBSERVATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN THE NORTHERN BERING AND CHUKCHI SEAS SINCE THE 1980S TO CHARACTERIZE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND RESPONSES OF ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT MARINE SEAFLOOR COMMUNITIES; (2) TEST THE EXTENT TO WHICH OBSERVATIONAL TIME SERIES CAN INFORM FORECASTS OF CHANGES IN THESE SYSTEMS; AND (3) EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF ONGOING SAMPLING EFFORTS TO DETECT BIOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN DOING SO, THIS PROJECT WILL IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO EXPLAIN, DETECT, AND PREDICT BIOLOGICAL RESPONSES IN CHANGING ARCTIC ENVIRONMENTS AND ADDRESS ASSOCIATED KNOWLEDGE GAPS USING NOVEL MODELING METHODS. THE ARCTIC IS ONE OF THE MOST RAPIDLY WARMING REGIONS ON THE PLANET AND ASSOCIATED IMPACTS ON HIGH BIOMASS SEAFLOOR COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTHERN BERING AND CHUKCHI SEAS WILL HAVE IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR POTENTIAL NORTHWARD FISHERIES EXPANSION AS WELL AS CO-MANAGEMENT OF SUBSISTENCE HARVESTS OF WALRUSES AND BEARDED SEALS BY INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. OUR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT, EXPLAIN, AND PREDICT CHANGES IN THESE SYSTEMS, AND IN DOING SO WE WILL SUPPORT EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF MARINE RESOURCES, WHILE MITIGATING SOCIAL IMPACTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION, WE WILL INTEGRATE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN MULTIPLE WAYS BY: (I) MENTORING SUMMER INTERNS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS ATTENDING A LOCAL COLLEGE IN RURAL APPALACHIA; (II) PROVIDING RESEARCH EXPERIENCES TO UNDERGRADUATES THROUGH AN EXISTING RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATES PROGRAM; AND (III) TRAINING OF A GRADUATE STUDENT IN SPATIAL MODELING, MARINE SCIENCE, AND GLOBAL CHANGE ECOLOGY. THESE PROGRAMS WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING THAT SPANS POLAR BIOLOGY, SPATIAL MODELING, STATISTICS, AND DATA SCIENCE FOR STUDENTS FROM BACKGROUNDS THAT ARE HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN THESE FIELDS.

THE PROJECT WILL CONVENE A WORKSHOP TO BUILD CONSENSUS ACROSS A DIVERSE COMMUNITY OF LIFE SCIENTISTS TO TURN THIS VISION INTO ACTIONABLE PROPOSALS, AND THERE IS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR THE COMMUNITY BUILDING AND PLANNING ACTIVITIES TO GALVANIZE AN ANTARCTIC ?OMICS INITIATIVE (AOI) THAT WILL HAVE CONSIDERABLE IMPACTS ON SOCIETY?S UNDERSTANDING OF ANTARCTIC LIFE BY ENGENDERING PREDICTIONS OF HOW IT MAY EVOLVE, RESIST, ACCLIMATE, OR BECOME SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGES IN CLIMATE. SOCIETAL BENEFITS INCLUDE ENGAGING THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY ACROSS MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES, ENHANCING THE DIVERSITY OF ANTARCTIC RESEARCHERS, DEVELOPING NEW EXPERTISE IN ANTARCTIC SCIENCES, AND FOSTERING AN INFORMED PUBLIC. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REALIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR MAKING FUNDAMENTAL ADVANCES IN UNDERSTANDING POLAR LIFE AND ITS INEXTRICABLE LINKS TO SURVIVAL AND ADAPTATION ACROSS ANTARCTICA?S REMARKABLY DIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS. THE PROJECT WILL FACILITATE A RESULTS-DRIVEN WORKSHOP TO CREATE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR MAKING TRANSFORMATIVE ADVANCES IN UNDERSTANDING ANTARCTIC BIOTA AND ASSEMBLAGES AND ADDRESS LARGE-SCALE, BROAD, ECOSYSTEM-BASED QUESTIONS.

IN MANY PLACES AROUND ANTARCTICA, THE ICE SHEET EXTENDS FROM THE LAND TO OVER THE OCEAN, FORMING FLOATING ICE SHELVES ON THE PERIPHERY. IF THIS CYCLE IS IN BALANCE, THE ICE SHEETS HELP MAINTAIN A STABLE SEA LEVEL. WHEN THE CLIMATE COOLS OR WARMS, HOWEVER, SEA LEVEL FALLS OR RISES AS THE ICE SHEET GAINS OR LOSES ICE. THE PERIPHERAL ICE SHELVES ARE IMPORTANT FOR REGULATING SEA LEVEL BECAUSE THEY HELP HOLD BACK THE FLOW OF ICE TO THE OCEAN. WARMING OCEAN WATERS THIN ICE SHELVES BY MELTING THEIR UNDERSIDES, ALLOWING ICE TO FLOW FASTER TO THE OCEAN, AND RAISING SEA LEVEL GLOBALLY. THUS, AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IS HOW MUCH SEA LEVEL WILL RISE IN RESPONSE TO WARMING OCEAN TEMPERATURES OVER THE NEXT CENTURY(S) THAT FURTHER THIN ANTARCTICA?S ICE SHELVES. CURRENTLY, WEST ANTARCTICA PRODUCES THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTINENT?S CONTRIBUTION TO SEA LEVEL. ALBEIT WITH LARGE UNCERTAINTY, ICE-SHEET MODELS INDICATE THAT TOTTEN AND DENMAN GLACIERS IN EAST ANTARCTICA COULD ALSO PRODUCE SUBSTANTIAL SEA-LEVEL RISE IN THE NEXT CENTURY(S). THIS INTERNATIONAL STUDY WILL FOCUS ON IMPROVING UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH THESE GLACIERS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SEA LEVEL UNDER VARIOUS WARMING SCENARIOS. THE PROJECT WILL USE NUMERICAL MODELS CONSTRAINED BY OCEANOGRAPHIC AND REMOTE SENSING OBSERVATIONS TO DETERMINE HOW TOTTEN AND DENMAN GLACIERS WILL RESPOND TO INCREASED MELTING. REMOTE SENSING DATA WILL PROVIDE UPDATED AND IMPROVED ESTIMATES OF THE MELT RATE FOR EACH ICE SHELF. TWO FLOAT PROFILERS WILL BE DEPLOYED FROM AIRCRAFT BY BRITISH AND AUSTRALIAN PARTNERS IN FRONT OF EACH ICE SHELF TO REPEATEDLY MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY OF THE WATER COLUMN, WITH THE RESULTS TELEMETERED BACK VIA SATELLITE LINK. THE MELT AND OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA WILL BE USED TO CONSTRAIN PARAMETERIZED TRANSFER FUNCTIONS FOR ICE-SHELF CAVITY MELTING IN RESPONSE TO OCEAN TEMPERATURE, IMPROVING ON CURRENT PARAMETERIZATIONS BASED ON LIMITED DATA. THESE MELT FUNCTIONS WILL BE USED WITH OCEAN TEMPERATURES FROM CLIMATE MODELS TO FORCE AN OPEN-SOURCE ICE-FLOW NUMERICAL MODEL FOR EACH GLACIER TO DETERMINE THE CENTURY-SCALE RESPONSE FOR A VARIETY OF SCENARIOS, HELPING TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY IN SEA LEVEL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THIS PART OF ANTARCTICA. PROCESSES OTHER THAN MELT THAT MIGHT FURTHER ALTER THE CONTRIBUTION TO SEA LEVEL OVER THE NEXT FEW CENTURIES WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED. ON THE OBSERVATIONAL SIDE, THE DEMONSTRATED DEPLOYMENT OF FLOAT PROFILERS FROM A SONOBUOY LAUNCH TUBE IN POLAR SETTINGS WOULD HELP RAISE THE TECHNOLOGY READINESS OF OPERATIONAL IN-SITU MONITORING OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING POLAR SHELF SEAS, PAVING THE WAY FOR AN EXPANSION OF OBSERVATIONS OF OCEAN HYDROGRAPHIC PROPERTIES FROM REMOTE AREAS THAT CURRENTLY ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. IN ADDITION TO BEING OF SCIENTIFIC VALUE, REDUCED UNCERTAINTY IN SEA-LEVEL RISE PROJECTIONS HAS STRONG SOCIETAL BENEFIT TO COASTAL COMMUNITIES STRUGGLING WITH LONG-RANGE PLANNING TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SEA-LEVEL RISE OVER THE COMING DECADES TO CENTURIES.

THE ARCTIC GREAT RIVERS OBSERVATORY (ARCTICGRO) INVESTIGATES HOW THE CHEMISTRY AND DISCHARGE OF THE ARCTIC'S LARGEST RIVERS ARE CHANGING. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE DISCHARGE AND CHEMISTRY OF ARCTIC RIVERS REFLECT PROCESSES OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THEIR WATERSHEDS, THUS PROVIDING AN INTEGRATIVE MEASURE OF TERRESTRIAL CHANGE. CHANGES IN RIVER CHEMISTRY AND DISCHARGE ALSO INFLUENCES THE CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, SEA ICE FORMATION, AND CIRCULATION OF THE RECEIVING COASTAL AND OCEAN WATERS, SO UNDERSTANDING ARCTIC OCEAN PROCESSES REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF CONTINENTAL INPUTS VIA RIVERS. THE ARCTIC GREAT RIVERS OBSERVATORY FOCUSES ON THE ARCTIC'S SIX LARGEST RIVERS; THE YUKON AND MACKENZIE IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE OB, YENISEY, LENA, AND KOLYMA IN SIBERIA. WATER SAMPLES ARE COLLECTED FROM EACH OF THESE RIVERS SIX TIMES PER YEAR AND ARE ANALYZED FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF BIOGEOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS INCLUDING NUTRIENTS, ORGANIC MATTER, MAJOR IONS AND TRACE ELEMENTS, AND SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS. ARCTICGRO ALSO CURATES DAILY DISCHARGE DATA FOR THESE SIX RIVERS AND HAS BEGUN TO GATHER AND DISSEMINATE DAILY DISCHARGE DATA FOR NINE ADDITIONAL RIVERS IN THE RUSSIAN ARCTIC.

THEY MAY ALSO BUFFER THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON TUNDRA ECOSYSTEMS BY REDUCING PERMAFROST THAW AND THE EXPANSION OF SHRUBS. UNTIL ~12,000 YEARS AGO, THE ARCTIC WAS HOME TO A DIVERSE ARRAY OF HERBIVORES (WOOLLY MAMMOTHS, BISON, WILD HORSES, CARIBOU, AND MUSKOXEN) COEXISTING IN AN ENVIRONMENT CALLED ?MAMMOTH STEPPE.? IT IS THOUGHT THAT THIS ENVIRONMENT WAS MAINTAINED BY LARGE HERBIVORES, SIMILAR TO MODERN AFRICAN SAVANNAS. AS A RESULT, SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT ?REWILDING? LARGE HERBIVORES COULD BE A VIABLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR THE ARCTIC. HOWEVER, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW MUCH THESE ECOSYSTEM PROPERTIES RELY ON HERBIVORE DIVERSITY BECAUSE FEW HIGH-LATITUDE SYSTEMS SUPPORT MULTIPLE SPECIES IN HIGH NUMBERS TODAY. THE FOSSIL RECORD PROVIDES A NATURAL ARCHIVE OF HOW LARGE HERBIVORES AND CLIMATE CHANGE INFLUENCED ARCTIC PLANT COMMUNITIES THROUGH TIME. THIS PROJECT BUILDS ON DISSERTATION-LEVEL RESEARCH EXAMINING A PALEOECOLOGICAL RECORD FROM SQUIRREL LAKE, ALASKA TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF PREHISTORIC HERBIVORE DIVERSITY ON THE LONG-TERM STABILITY OF ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS AND IDENTIFY THE SPECIES THAT MADE UP THE ICE AGE HERBIVORE COMMUNITY. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE ROLE OF LARGE HERBIVORE DIVERSITY ON ARCTIC ECOSYSTEM PROPERTIES BY CREATING A MULTI-PROXY SEDIMENT RECORD OF THE PLANT AND ANIMAL DIVERSITY THAT SURROUNDED SQUIRREL LAKE (KOTZEBUE SOUND, ALASKA) IN A PERIOD SPANNING FROM TODAY TO ~55,000 YEARS BEFORE PRESENT.

THE THAWING OF ORGANIC CARBON STORED IN ARCTIC PERMAFROST SOILS ULTIMATELY CREATES CARBON DIOXIDE (A GREENHOUSE GAS). FURTHER, THIS PROCESS IS PREDICTED TO AMPLIFY WITH ADDITIONAL GLOBAL WARMING, HOWEVER, TO AN UNKNOWN EXTENT. THEREFORE, WE NEED TO QUANTIFY THE EXTENT TO WHICH CARBON DIOXIDE RELEASED FROM THAWING PERMAFROST WILL AMPLIFY GLOBAL WARMING; THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT QUESTIONS THAT ARCTIC SCIENTISTS MUST ANSWER. TO ADDRESS THIS, THIS PROJECT WILL MAKE MEASUREMENTS TO QUANTIFY HOW MUCH CARBON DIOXIDE IS PRODUCED WHEN ORGANIC CARBON FROM THAWING PERMAFROST SOILS FLOWS INTO SUNLIT ARCTIC SURFACE WATERS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO LEVERAGE AN EXISTING UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PROGRAM CALLED EARTH CAMP TO ENGAGE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES THROUGH HANDS-ON EXPERIENCES AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES. AS WATER MOVES THROUGH THAWED SOIL IT DISSOLVES ORGANIC CARBON. THIS DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) THEN FLOWS INTO STREAMS, PONDS, AND LAKES. ONCE IN SURFACE WATERS, BOTH MICROBES AND SUNLIGHT OXIDIZE DOC TO CO2. DOC EXPOSED TO SUNLIGHT IS EASIER FOR MICROBES TO OXIDIZE TO CO2 COMPARED TO THE SAME DOC KEPT IN THE DARK. HOWEVER, THE SUNLIGHT REACHING SURFACE WATERS SPANS A SPECTRUM OF WAVELENGTHS, FROM THE HIGH-ENERGY ULTRAVIOLET (UV) TO THE LOWER-ENERGY VISIBLE LIGHT. A CRITICAL UNKNOWN IS WHICH WAVELENGTHS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE UV TO THE VISIBLE ARE MOST EFFICIENT AT HELPING MICROBES TO OXIDIZE DOC TO CO2. IF VISIBLE LIGHT HELPS MICROBES OXIDIZE MORE DOC TO CO2 THAN CURRENTLY ASSUMED, THE CO2 PRODUCED FROM THIS PROCESS COULD BE DOUBLE THE CURRENT ESTIMATE BECAUSE THERE IS MORE VISIBLE LIGHT REACHING SURFACE WATERS THAN UV LIGHT. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OF SUNLIGHT MAY HELP MICROBES OXIDIZE A FRACTION OF DOC THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUNLIGHT, MICROBES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OXIDIZE TO CO2. THIS FRACTION OF DOC THAT IS DIFFICULT TO OXIDIZE MAY BE SOME OF THE OLDEST CARBON THAT HAS BEEN FROZEN FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN PERMAFROST SOILS.

MICROORGANISMS IN THE WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET ARE BURIED OVER GLACIOLOGICAL TIME AND FORM A STRATIGRAPHY RECORD PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY OF ANALYSIS OF THE ORDER AND POSITION OF LAYERS OF GEOLOGICAL EVENTS, WITH POTENTIAL LINKS TO SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE CLIMATE. HOWEVER, MICROBIAL CELLS THAT LAND ON THE ICE SHEET ARE SUBJECT TO THE STRESSES OF CHANGING HABITAT CONDITIONS DUE TO BURIAL AND CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM ISOLATION IN ICE. THESE PROCESSES MAY LEAD TO A LOSS OF FIDELITY WITHIN THE STRATIGRAPHIC RECORD OF MICROBIAL CELLS. WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW AND IF MICROORGANISMS SURVIVE BURIAL AND REMAIN ALIVE OVER GLACIAL-INTERGLACIAL TIME PERIODS WITHIN AN ICE SHEET. THIS ANALYSIS WILL IDENTIFY THE VIABLE AND PRESERVED COMMUNITY OF MICROORGANISMS AND CORE GENOMIC ADAPTATION THAT PERMIT CELL VIABILITY, WHICH WILL ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE IN THE AREAS OF MICROBIOLOGY AND GLACIOLOGY WHILE INCREASING FIDELITY OF ICE CORE MEASUREMENTS RELEVANT TO PAST CLIMATE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE GLOBAL CLIMATE IMPACTS. THIS EXPLORATORY ENDEAVOR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A TRANSFORMATIVE STEP TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THE ECOLOGY OF ONE OF THE MOST UNDERSTUDIED ENVIRONMENTS ON EARTH.

RESULTS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST DNA DATA BASED ON SINGLE-CELL WHOLE GENOMIC SEQUENCING FROM THE ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET AND INFORM WHETHER POST-DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES IMPACT THE INTERPRETATIONS OF PALEOENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FROM MICROBES. THE GOALS TO DETERMINE THE TAXONOMIC IDENTITY OF VIABLE AND PRESERVED MICROBIAL CELLS, AND DECODE THE GENETIC REPERTOIRE THAT CONFERS SURVIVAL OF BURIAL AND LONG-TERM VIABILITY WITHIN GLACIAL ICE, WILL BE ACHIEVED BY UTILIZING SUBSAMPLES FROM A ~60,000 YEAR OLD RECORD OF THE WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET DIVIDE (WD) ICE CORE. WD SAMPLES WILL BE MELTED USING THE DESERT RESEARCH INSTITUTE?S ICE CORE MELTING SYSTEM THAT IS OPTIMIZED FOR GLACIOBIOLOGICAL SAMPLING. MICROBIAL CELLS FROM THE MELTWATER WILL BE SORTED USING FLUORESCENCE-ACTIVATED CELL SORTING, AND INDIVIDUALLY SORTED CELLS WILL HAVE THEIR GENOMES SEQUENCED. THE FLUORESCENCE-BASED METHODS WILL DISCERN THE VIABLE (METABOLICALLY ACTIVE) CELLS FROM THOSE CELLS THAT ARE NON-VIABLE BUT PRESERVED IN THE ICE (DNA-CONTAINING). THE GENOMIC ANALYSIS WILL IDENTIFY THE TAXONOMY OF EACH CELL, PRESENCE OF KNOWN GENES THAT CONFER SURVIVAL IN PERMANENTLY FROZEN ENVIRONMENTS, AND COMPARATIVELY ANALYZE GENOMES TO DETERMINE THE CORE SET OF GENES REQUIRED BY VIABLE CELLS TO PERSIST IN AN ICE SHEET.

THOUGH IT IS ONLY 3% OF THE TOTAL OCEAN IT TAKES UP 10% OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE WE ADD TO THE ATMOSPHERE EVERY YEAR. THOUGH THE ARCTIC HAS ALWAYS HAD A PERMANENT ICE CAP, IT IS SHRINKING IN SIZE AND BY THE YEAR 2040 THE PERMANENT SUMMER ICE CAP WILL BE GONE. THIS IMPLIES THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASED INTENSITY IN THE AMOUNT OF ICE THAT MELTS EACH YEAR AND THERE IS LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT HOW THE MELTING ICE WILL ALTER ARCTIC SURFACE WATER CHEMISTRY. THIS STUDY WILL SAMPLE ARCTIC SEA ICE, SNOW, AND BRINE TO MAP ITS CHEMISTRY PROFILES IN THE EASTERN ARCTIC WITH THE GOAL OF MAKING BETTER PREDICTIONS IN THE FUTURE ARCTIC ENVIRONMENT AS THE ARCTIC CLIMATE CHANGES. THE MAIN FOCUS IS ON THE ICE PROFILES OF BORON AND SALINITY WHICH HAVE A CONSTANT RATIO IN THE OPEN OCEAN, BUT THIS RATIO MAY SHIFT IN THE MARGINAL ICE ZONE AT SALINITIES THAT ARE LESS THAN 30 G/KG AND ARE FRESHENED BY MELT. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO CREATE LESSONS THAT SHOW HOW WE USE CHEMISTRY TO DO THIS WORK AND UNDERSTAND CLIMATE. THIS PROJECT JOINS THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS AND THE ONSET OF SEA ICE MELT (ARTOFMELT) EXPEDITION ON THE I/B ODEN IN MAY JUNE 2023 TO CONDUCT SAMPLING IN THE MARGINAL ICE ZONE (MIZ), INCLUDING ICE CORES AND BRINE. THE GOAL IS TO DISCERN THE BORON TO SALINITY RATIOS OF THESE UNIQUE SYSTEMS AND THEIR IMPACT ON TOTAL ALKALINITY AND UPTAKE OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2. THE OBJECTIVES INCLUDE; 1) TO DETERMINE THE BORON TO SALINITY (B/S) RATIOS IN ARCTIC SEA-ICE AND BRINE, 2) TO DETERMINE THE CARBONATE SYSTEM PARAMETERS IN ARCTIC SEA-ICE AND BRINE, 3) TO COMPARE THE PROFILES OF ALL ABOVE PARAMETERS IN ANNUAL VS MULTI-YEAR ICE AND BRINE, 4) TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THESE PARAMETERS OVER THE ICE-MELT PROCESS AT A GIVEN ICE STATION, AND 5) TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON B/S RATIOS AND TOTAL ALKALINITY IN ADJACENT MELTWATERS OF THE MIZ. INTELLECTUAL MERIT: THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO BIOGEOCHEMICAL, PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHIC, METEOROLOGICAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH. THE RESULTS OF THE B/S RATIOS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT CORRECTIONS TO TOTAL ALKALINITY ANALYSES IN POLAR REGIONS AND IMPROVE PARAMETERIZATIONS IN FUTURE ARCTIC CO2 UPTAKE ESTIMATES AND MODELING EFFORTS. MOST NOTABLY, THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST EVER BORON TO SALINITY PROFILES IN ANNUAL ICE IN THIS REGION AND THE FIRST MULTIYEAR ICE PROFILES IN ANY REGION. IN ADDITION, ICE AND BRINE PROFILES OF OTHER BIOGEOCHEMICALLY RELEVANT PARAMETERS WILL BE GENERATED. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS ON THE FUTURE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF THE WARMING ARCTIC AND ARCTIC CO2 UPTAKE. BROADER IMPACTS: TEN PAIRED VIDEOS (FROM THE CRUISE) AND LESSON PLANS WILL BE GENERATED THAT TARGET HIGH SCHOOL AND UNDERGRADUATE CHEMISTRY STUDENTS BASED ON CHEMICAL CONCEPTS USED IN THIS RESEARCH (EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS, ACIDITY CONSTANTS, ETC.). FOLLOWING THE CRUISE THESE WILL BE POSTED ON THE PROJECT WEBPAGE AND SHARED WITH PBS LEARNING MEDIA AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE PLATFORMS. ALL LESSONS WILL INTRODUCE THE THEME OF ARCTIC ICE LOSS.

SOIL HEALTH REFLECTS THE ABILITY OF SOIL TO SUPPORT BOTH PLANT GROWTH AND OTHER ECOSYSTEMS. TO DATE, THERE IS LIMITED KNOWLEDGE ON HOW SOIL MICROBIOME COMPOSITIONS AND ACTIVITIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTROCHEMICAL SIGNALS IN THE SOIL ENVIRONMENT. ELECTROCHEMICAL SIGNALS PRODUCED BY ORGANISMS IN SOIL CAN BE USED TO ADVANCE NON-DESTRUCTIVE MONITORING OF BELOWGROUND MICROBIOMES AND THEIR FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS TO SOIL HEALTH AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY. THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SOIL MICROBIOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AND ELECTROCHEMICAL SIGNALS CAN BE USED AS A SENSOR.

ACCORDING TO THE US CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL, ARSENIC (AS) IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY CONTAMINANT DUE TO ITS PREVALENCE AND ASSOCIATION WITH NUMEROUS CHRONIC DISEASES, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND DIABETES. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE CHRONICALLY EXPOSED TO HIGH LEVELS OF NATURALLY OCCURRING AS THROUGH BOTH DRINKING WATER AND FOOD. PADDY RICE FIELDS, WHICH COVER 12% OF ALL ARABLE LAND AND PROVIDE 20% OF HUMAN CALORIC INTAKE, CONTAIN ABUNDANT IRON OXIDES THAT RETAIN NATURAL AS. IRON REDUCTION IN PADDY FIELDS MOBILIZES THIS AS INTO WATER WHERE IT CAN BE ABSORBED INTO RICE CROPS. HUMANS ARE EXPOSED TO THIS TOXIC AS WHEN THEY CONSUME THIS RICE, AND THE AS ALSO REDUCES OVERALL RICE YIELDS BECAUSE IT IS TOXIC TO RICE TOO. THUS, AS RELEASE FROM RICE PADDY SOILS POSES A HUMAN HEALTH RISK AND THREATENS FARMING COMMUNITIES AND THE SUPPLY OF ONE OF THE WORLD?S MOST IMPORTANT CROPS. THIS COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH TEAM FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, UNION COLLEGE, AND SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY AIMS TO IDENTIFY HOW RICE CULTIVATION PRACTICES, ALONG WITH CLIMATE, AFFECT WHERE AND WHEN AS IS RELEASED FROM RICE PADDY SOILS AND HOW THIS ULTIMATELY TRANSLATES INTO ABSORPTION INTO THE RICE CROP. FINDINGS FROM THIS WORK WILL USE REAL-TIME DATA FROM FIELD AND SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS TO HELP PREDICT AREAS OF GREATEST RISK OF AS IN THE RICE CROP AND TO IDENTIFY RICE CULTIVATION PRACTICES THAT MINIMIZE AS UPTAKE BY THE RICE CROP. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED WITH FARMING COMMUNITIES IN THE PROJECT STUDY AREAS OF CAMBODIA AND TEXAS AS WELL AS WITH THE BROADER SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO HELP PROMOTE BETTER RICE CULTIVATION PRACTICES. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CONTROL THE DISSOLVED AS CONCENTRATION AND SPECIATION IN RICE PADDY SOILS, AND TO USE THIS INFORMATION TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. THIS RESEARCH GOAL IS WELL-SUITED TO SITS BECAUSE THIS MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM FUSES FREQUENT AND DENSE MEASUREMENTS OF SOIL GEOCHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY, MICROBIOLOGY, AND HYDROLOGY COLLECTED WITH IN SITU SENSORS, REMOTE SENSING, AND SAMPLING IN RICE PADDY SOILS TO OBSERVE, MODEL, AND PREDICT ARSENIC SOLID-SOLUTION PARTITIONING AND UPTAKE INTO RICE.

AN URGENT NEED EXISTS FOR DEVELOPING INEXPENSIVE, LONG-TERM DEPLOYABLE SENSORS THAT CAN MONITOR VARIABLE SOIL CONDITIONS IN REAL-TIME. UNDERSTANDING THE PARAMETERS THAT CONTROL THE SOIL HEALTH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN MANAGING THE GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OF PLANTS AS WELL AS IN MAINTAINING SOIL HEALTH. ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW SENSORS IS DELIVERING THE POWER NEEDED TO OPERATE THE SENSORS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE LEFT BURIED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A MULTI-MODAL INTEGRATED SENSOR SYSTEM THAT CAN BE COMPLETELY BURIED 15 CM OR DEEPER IN THE SOIL FOR REAL-TIME MONITORING OF SOIL GAS FLOWS, SUCH AS CARBON DIOXIDE, AMMONIA, OXYGEN, AND NITROUS OXIDE, THAT GIVES INFORMATION ABOUT SOIL AND PLANT HEALTH. ALL THE ELECTRICAL POWER NEEDED FOR THE SENSOR OPERATION, AS WELL AS THE SIGNAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE SENSOR, WILL BE DELIVERED USING A THROUGH-THE-SOIL (TTS) POWER TRANSMISSION TECHNIQUE, WHERE ELECTRICAL ENERGY IS SENT THROUGH THE SOIL, ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR WIRES, SURFACE ANTENNAS, OR EMBEDDED BATTERIES. USING TTS POWER TRANSFER, AN AGRICULTURAL FIELD CAN BE PERMANENTLY INSTRUMENTED WITH SENSORS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH DAILY FARMING OPERATIONS.

THIS COLLABORATIVE PROJECT INVOLVING RESEARCHERS AT TENNESSEE TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE, AND STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO WILL PRODUCE NEW KNOWLEDGE AND ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES THAT WILL ENHANCE THE ABILITIES OF FARMERS TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS IN THE GROWING CYCLE OF CROPS. THIS IMPACT ALONE WILL REDUCE WASTE, IMPROVE CROP YIELD, AND ULTIMATELY GENERATE GREATER ECONOMIC INCOME FOR THE NATION AND ITS FARMERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CONDUCT RESEARCH TOWARD DEVELOPING THE NEXT-GENERATION OF IN-SITU, NETWORKED, MULTI-MODAL MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS FOR CONTINUOUS AND UNINTERRUPTED MONITORING OF SOIL VARIABLES OVER VARIABLE SPACE AND TIME PERIODS. CONTEMPORARY LOW-COST SOIL MONITORING SYSTEMS ARE DISCRETE AND ARE INCAPABLE OF DETECTING SOIL CHEMICAL VARIABLES BEYOND PH. THE FIRST PROJECT GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A SENSOR SYSTEM THAT ANALYZES THE VAPOR PHASE ANALYTES OUTGASSED DURING BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT CHARACTERIZE SOIL HEALTH. THE MULTI-MODAL SENSOR SYSTEM UTILIZES THREE ORTHOGONAL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES COMBINED INTO A SINGLE PLATFORM TO DETECT THE ANALYTE VAPORS WITH HIGH CHEMICAL SELECTIVITY AND SENSITIVITY IN REAL-TIME. FIRST AND SECOND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES USE ARRAYS OF RECEPTOR-IMMOBILIZED MICRO-CANTILEVERS TO PRECONCENTRATE AND DETECT MASS CHANGES. THE THIRD ORTHOGONAL METHOD USES THE SAME ARRAYS TO DISCERN THE MOLECULAR IDENTITY OF ADSORBED GASES USING PHOTOTHERMAL DEFLECTION SPECTROSCOPY (PDS). THESE CHEMICALLY SPECIFIC, EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, AND HIGHLY COMPACT SENSORS WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH CONVENTIONAL SOIL SENSING SYSTEMS THAT DETECT MOISTURE, TEMPERATURE, AND PH TO CREATE A MULTI-SENSING PROBE. THE SECOND PROJECT GOAL IS TO POWER THE SENSOR SYSTEM USING THE TTS POWER TRANSMISSION TECHNIQUE CAPABLE OF TRANSFERRING ENERGY FROM AN ELECTRICAL POWER SOURCE TO A PLURALITY OF MULTI-SENSING PROBES OVER WIDE LANDSCAPE SCALE AREAS. THE AIM IS TO PROVIDE THE SENSOR SYSTEMS WITH A STABLE, UNINTERRUPTABLE SOURCE OF POWER TO ACHIEVE A CONTINUOUS SENSOR OPERATION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE MAINTENANCE AND IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO INTERFERENCES. THE WIRELESS TRANSMISSION WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE EXCITATION OF A NON-RADIATING PULSED CONDUCTION MODE OF PROPAGATION AT RADIO FREQUENCIES. THE THIRD PROJECT GOAL IS TO ANALYZE THE DATA FROM THE WIRELESSLY POWERED, MULTI-SENSOR PROBE NETWORK IN ORDER TO BUILD PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS NEEDED TO CHARACTERIZE SOIL HEALTH AND MAKE CRITICAL GROWING DECISIONS. THE RESEARCH GOALS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE IN BROADENING UNDERSTANDING OF SOIL HEALTH AND LEAD TO BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES AND ENHANCED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. THE DATA AND KNOWLEDGE UNCOVERED DURING THE PROJECT WILL HAVE PROFOUND IMPACTS IN MANY AREAS OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, AND INDUSTRY. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS WORK INCLUDE: (1) A HISTORICAL FIRST IN REAL-TIME COLLECTION OF PHYSIOCHEMICAL SPECIFIC DATA IN A HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DENSITY OVER A LANDSCAPE SIZE AREA AND (2) DEMONSTRATION OF A COMPLETELY NEW METHOD OF WIRELESS ELECTRICAL POWER TRANSMISSION OVER A LANDSCAPE AREA.

NONETHELESS, PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AN ACTIVE POPULATION OF EDDIES BENEATH THE ARCTIC SEA ICE AND SHOWN THAT THESE EDDIES PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING THE LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION IN THE ARCTIC SEAS. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN NO SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT TO STUDY SUCH EDDIES UNDER ANTARCTIC SEA ICE, LEAVING A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EDDIES AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE LARGE-SCALE OCEAN CIRCULATION AROUND ANTARCTICA. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH COMBINES MULTIPLE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EDDY DYNAMICS. STATISTICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE SUB-SEA ICE EDDY FIELD WILL BE DERIVED USING HYDROGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS UNDER ANTARCTIC SEA ICE FROM ARGO FLOATS AND INSTRUMENTED SEALS. HIGH-RESOLUTION GLOBAL OCEAN AND SEA ICE MODELS WILL BE USED TO TRACK THE SIMULATED EDDIES BACK TO THEIR FORMATION SITES TO IDENTIFY THE EDDY FORMATION MECHANISMS. THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE EDDIES PRIMARILY ORIGINATE FROM HYDRODYNAMIC INSTABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSURFACE DENSITY GRADIENTS. THESE THEORETICAL, MODELING, AND DATA ANALYSIS APPROACHES WILL BE COMBINED TO ESTIMATE THE EDDIES' CONTRIBUTION TO LATERAL TRACER TRANSPORTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON MEAN CIRCULATIONS OF THE NEAR-ANTARCTIC OCEAN. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL FACILITATE FUTURE SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVORS BY PROVIDING PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE DATABASES OF DETECTED EDDY PROPERTIES. THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPORT THE RESEARCH OF SEVERAL JUNIOR SCIENTISTS: AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND AN EARLY-CAREER FACULTY MEMBER.

USING FREELY AVAILABLE DATA FROM A NUMBER OF SIMULATIONS, THIS RESEARCH WILL USE OCEAN HEAT PATTERNS TO ASSESS HOW THE TIMING OF AUTUMN SEA ICE FREEZE UP RELATES TO SEASONAL PREDICTABILITY. THE RESEARCHER EXPECTS THIS PROJECT TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON SEA ICE CHANGE ACROSS THE ARCTIC OCEAN, BY APPLYING STATISTICS TO EVALUATE WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FOR SEA ICE LOSS. OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS, SEA ICE HAS DECLINED IN ALL MONTHS, LEAVING THINNER AND SMALLER SEA ICE FLOES, AND SUCH CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE DUE TO CLIMATE WARMING. THESE CHANGES PRODUCE NOT ONLY CLIMATE IMPACTS, BUT ALSO ECONOMIC IMPACTS, WHICH IS WHY ACCURATELY FORECASTING SEA ICE EXTENT ON SEASONAL SCALES IS IMPORTANT. AS THE ARCTIC LOSES SEA ICE COVER, IT BECOMES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO SHIPPING AND RESOURCE EXTRACTION BUT ALSO LESS RELIABLE FOR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES AND THREATENED SPECIES THAT DEPEND ON THE ICE. SEA ICE CAN GROW TO BE MULTIPLE METERS THICK CAUSING REGIONS OF THE ARCTIC TO BE IMPASSIBLE, UNLESS THE ENTITY HAS ACCESS TO AN ICEBREAKER SHIP. BETTER KNOWING THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO SEA ICE CHANGE WILL IMPROVE MODELS AND INFORM THE PUBLIC SO THEY CAN PLAN MORE EFFICIENTLY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ENGAGE MINORITY GROUPS AND ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREATER SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ARCTIC CLIMATE FOR PEOPLE AT MANY EDUCATIONAL LEVELS. THIS WILL BE DONE BY CREATING A SHORT COURSE FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS CALLED A DATA PUZZLE (HTTPS://DATAPUZZLES.ORG/) AND EMPLOYING AN UNDERGRADUATE INTERN. WHILE BASIC PHYSICAL PROCESSES IMPACTING SEA ICE LOSS IN THE ARCTIC ARE WELL RECOGNIZED, LITTLE QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION EXISTS ON THE MAGNITUDES, VARIABILITY, AND TRENDS IN SEASONAL ARCTIC OCEAN HEAT UPTAKE AND RELEASE. THIS PROJECT WILL MAKE NOVEL USE OF OCEAN HEAT GAIN DATA FROM THREE RETROSPECTIVE MODELS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUTPUT FROM THE NEWLY AVAILABLE COMMUNITY EARTH SYSTEM MODEL VERSION 2 LARGE ENSEMBLE (CESM2-LE). USING SEA ICE CONCENTRATION (SIC) DATA FROM THE COMBINED PASSIVE MICROWAVE SEA ICE RECORD, THE TOTAL DAYS WITH OPEN WATER AT EACH GRID CELL WILL BE CALCULATED TO ASSESS HOW OPEN WATER DAYS AND THE DATE OF AUTUMN FREEZE UP HAVE VARIED AND CHANGED. LASTLY, A SEASONAL AUTOREGRESSIVE INTEGRATED MOVING AVERAGE MODEL (SARIMA) WILL BE USED TO PREDICT SEASONAL SIC AT LEAD TIMES OF ONE, TWO AND THREE MONTHS.

THE PRESENCE OF THESE PARTICLES, SUCH AS BLACK CARBON AND DUST, LOWERS THE SURFACE ALBEDO, RESULTING IN INCREASED SOLAR ABSORPTION THAT QUICKLY THINS THE IMPURITY-LADEN ICE. DEPOSITION OF BLACK CARBON ONTO ARCTIC SEA ICE IS LIKELY GROWING DUE TO THE INCREASING FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF FIRES IN THE ARCTIC.

BREAKUP OF THIS ICE IS LIKELY DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF MELTING AND OCEAN WAVE ACTION. FOLLOWING SPRING BREAKUP, WHEN ICE IS NOT PRESENT FOR THE SUMMER MONTHS, THERE IS MORE WAVE ENERGY AT THE COAST. WAVES CAN INCREASE COASTAL EROSION. HOWEVER, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH WAVES BREAK UP COASTAL SEA ICE AND CONTRIBUTE TO ARCTIC COASTAL EROSION ARE STILL LIMITED BY A LACK OF OBSERVATIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST USE OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR BETTER MEASURING WAVES IN COASTAL ICE. THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE RAPIDLY ERODING COASTAL ARCTIC. THE RESULTS WILL HAVE BROAD APPLICATIONS FOR BOTH SCIENTIFIC AND COASTAL ARCTIC COMMUNITIES, AND THE PROJECT WILL ENGAGE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO BUILD AND DEPLOY INSTRUMENTS. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST OUR ABILITY TO MEASURE WAVES IN ICE-COVERED REGIONS USING SEAFLOOR CABLES. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL MEASURE WAVES ALONG A SEAFLOOR CABLE AND BY SURFACE BUOYS OVER WEEK-LONG PERIODS IN SPRING, SUMMER, AND FALL 2022. CABLE MEASUREMENTS WILL BE COLLECTED USING SHORE-BASED INSTRUMENTATION BY COLLABORATORS AT SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORY, WHILE BUOYS WILL BE DEPLOYED ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE CABLE BY AIRBORNE OR VESSEL-BASED METHODS. THESE MEASUREMENTS AIM TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT COASTAL ICE AND ITS BREAKUP, INCLUDING: (1) WHAT IS THE ROLE OF WAVES IN BREAKING UP ICE? AND (2) HOW DO WAVES CHANGE AND EVOLVE IN AREAS OF COASTAL ICE? THE CO-LOCATION OF BUOY DEPLOYMENTS AND CABLE MEASUREMENTS DURING THIS PERIOD AIMS TO PRODUCE A METHOD THAT WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO MEASURE WAVES USING SEAFLOOR CABLES IN THE FUTURE WITH NO ADDITIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF EQUIPMENT. THE POTENTIAL FOR PERSISTENT, HIGH-RESOLUTION OBSERVATIONS OF SURFACE WAVES USING CABLES OPENS NEW AVENUES OF RESEARCH IN THIS AREA. THE ICE-COVERED SEASON IN THE ALASKAN ARCTIC IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO SHORTEN IN FUTURE YEARS, AND THE ROLE OF WAVES IS LIKELY TO BE GREATER.

THIS PROJECT WILL PRODUCE A NEW, PHYSICALLY REALISTIC RECONSTRUCTION OF ARCTIC SEA ICE AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES DURING THE 20TH CENTURY AND USE IT TO STUDY ARCTIC SEA ICE DURING THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY WARMING (ETCW), A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING PERIOD BETWEEN 1915-1940 WHEN THE ARCTIC WARMED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE ETCW IS A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING PERIOD, AS IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT DURING 1915-1940 THE ARCTIC WARMED SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT RECONSTRUCTIONS OF SEA-ICE EXTENT DURING THAT TIME DO NOT SHOW A REALISTIC CORRESPONDING SEA ICE LOSS DUE TO POOR SEA ICE DATA AVAILABILITY. IN ADDITION, WIDELY USED 20TH CENTURY REANALYSIS ALSO FAIL TO CAPTURE THE ETCW IN THE ARCTIC, MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE USE OF THESE SEA ICE RECONSTRUCTIONS AS BOUNDARY CONDITIONS.

THEY SURROUND 75 PERCENT OF ANTARCTICA AND HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REGULATING THE RATE THAT INLAND GLACIER ICE IS LOST TO THE OCEAN, WHICH LEADS TO SEA-LEVEL RISE. MELTWATER THAT PONDS ON THE SURFACES OF THESE ICE SHELVES HAS BEEN OBSERVED TO CAUSE ICE SHELVES TO FLEX AND FRACTURE, AND, IN SOME CASES, TO EXPERIENCE LARGE-SCALE COLLAPSE EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NEAR-COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF THE LARSEN B ICE SHELF IN 2002 IS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE DRAINAGE OF OVER 2000 SURFACE LAKES DURING JUST A NUMBER OF WEEKS. EXTENSIVE PONDING IS OBSERVED ON MANY OF ANTARCTICA?S ICE SHELVES. AS ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES INCREASE, SURFACE MELTWATER-INDUCED ICE-SHELF BREAKUP EVENTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN AREAL EXTENT AND FREQUENCY. HOWEVER, FUTURE PREDICTIONS OF SUCH EVENTS LACK ACCURACY BECAUSE NO LARGE-SCALE ICE-SHEET MODEL IS ABLE TO REALISTICALLY SIMULATE THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SURFACE-MELTWATER-INDUCED ICE-SHELF BREAKUP. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT MODELING LIMITATION BY DEVELOPING A NEW COMPONENT FOR THE CONTINENTAL-SCALE ICE-SHEET AND SEA-LEVEL SYSTEM MODEL (ISSM) THAT WILL BE CAPABLE OF SIMULATING SURFACE MELTWATER-INDUCED FLEXURE, FRACTURE, AND LARGE-SCALE ICE-SHELF BREAK-UP. BY FORCING THE MODEL WITH A SUITE OF FUTURE CLIMATE-CHANGE SCENARIOS THE PROJECT AIMS TO DELIVER MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF ANTARCTICA?S CONTRIBUTION TO FUTURE GLOBAL SEA-LEVEL RISE OVER THE REMAINDER OF THIS CENTURY AND BEYOND. TO ACHIEVE THE PROJECT?S ULTIMATE STEP OF DEVELOPING A NEW MODEL COMPONENT FOR THE ICE-SHEET AND SEA-LEVEL SYSTEM MODEL (ISSM), THE TEAM WILL FIRST DEVELOP A COUPLED PROCESS-SCALE MODEL OF ICE-SHELF HYDROLOGY-FLOW-FLEXURE-FRACTURE (THE H3F MODEL). THIS IS REQUIRED BECAUSE THE PHYSICS INVOLVED IN ICE-SHELF COLLAPSE TYPICALLY OCCURS ON FINER TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES THAN CAPTURED BY CONTINENTAL ICE-SHEET MODELS SUCH AS ISSM. ONCE THE H3F MODEL IS DEVELOPED, IT WILL BE USED TO QUANTIFY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SURFACE MELTWATER PROCESSES, ICE FLOW, VISCOELASTIC FLEXURE, AND HYDROFRACTURE. THE TEAM WILL TRANSLATE THESE RELATIONSHIPS TO THE ICE-SHEET SCALE BY DEVELOPING A MACHINE-LEARNING-LEVERAGED STATISTICAL EMULATOR OF THE H3F MODEL. THIS APPROACH TOWARDS MULTI-PHYSICS MODELING AIMS TO PROVIDE NEW INROADS TO THE COMPUTATIONALLY CHALLENGING PROBLEM OF SURFACE MELTWATER-INDUCED ICE-SHELF COLLAPSE AT BOTH SMALL- AND CONTINENTAL-SCALES.

PHYTOPLANKTON SERVE AS THE BASE OF THE FOOD CHAIN, AND THEIR GROWTH ALSO REMOVES CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH IS FERTILIZED IN THIS AREA BY NUTRIENT IRON, WHICH IS ONLY PRESENT AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS IN SEAWATER. PRIOR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE SEABED SEDIMENTS MAY PROVIDE IRON TO THE AMUNDSEN SEA ECOSYSTEM. HOWEVER, SEDIMENT SOURCES OF IRON HAVE NEVER BEEN STUDIED HERE DIRECTLY. THIS PROJECT FILLS THIS GAP BY ANALYZING SEDIMENTS FROM THE AMUNDSEN SEA AND INVESTIGATING WHETHER SEDIMENT IRON FERTILIZES PLANKTON GROWTH. THE RESULTS WILL HELP SCIENTISTS UNDERSTAND THE BASIC ECOSYSTEM DRIVERS AND PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THIS VIBRANT, VULNERABLE REGION. THIS PROJECT ALSO EMPHASIZES INCLUSIVITY AND OPENNESS TO THE PUBLIC. THE RESEARCHERS WILL ESTABLISH A MENTORING NETWORK FOR DIVERSE POLAR SCIENTISTS THROUGH THE POLAR IMPACT NETWORK AND COMMUNICATE THEIR RESULTS TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH THE WEBSITE CRYOCONNECT.ORG. THIS PROJECT LEVERAGES SAMPLES ALREADY COLLECTED FROM THE AMUNDSEN SEA (NBP22-02) TO INVESTIGATE SEDIMENT IRON (FE) CYCLING AND FLUXES. THE BROAD QUESTIONS DRIVING THIS RESEARCH ARE 1) DOES BENTHIC FE FERTILIZE ANTARCTIC COASTAL PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, AND 2) WHAT ARE THE FEEDBACKS BETWEEN BENTHIC FE RELEASE AND CARBON CYCLING IN THE COASTAL ANTARCTIC? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, THE RESEARCHERS WILL ANALYZE PORE WATER FE CONTENT AND SPECIATION AND CALCULATE FLUXES OF FE ACROSS THE SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE. THESE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED TO SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT, REACTIVE FE CONTENT, PROXIMITY TO GLACIAL SOURCES) TO IDENTIFY CONTROLS ON BENTHIC FE RELEASE. THIS RESEARCH DOVETAILS WITH AND EXPANDS ON THE SCIENCE GOALS OF THE ?ACCELERATING THWAITES ECOSYSTEM IMPACTS FOR THE SOUTHERN OCEAN? (ARTEMIS) PROJECT THROUGH WHICH THE FIELD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED. IN TURN, THE FINDINGS OF ARTEMIS REGARDING MODELED AND OBSERVED TRACE METAL DYNAMICS, SURFACE WATER PRODUCTIVITY, AND CARBON CYCLING WILL INFORM THE CONCLUSIONS OF THIS PROJECT, ALLOWING INSIGHT INTO THE IMPACT OF BENTHIC FE IN THE WHOLE SYSTEM.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET IS UNDERGOING ACCELERATED ICE LOSS, WHICH IS LARGELY DUE TO WARM OCEAN WATERS FROM THE SOUTH MELTING THE UNDERSIDES OF THE GLACIERS SURROUNDING THE COAST. TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ARE: (1) WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE FATE OF THE INCREASED MELTWATER? AND (2) HOW ARE THE WARM WATERS ABLE TO GET SO CLOSE TO THE COAST OF GREENLAND? IN FALL OF 2021, A DETAILED SHIPBOARD SURVEY OF THE CIRCULATION AND WATER CHARACTERISTICS IN BAFFIN BAY (ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF GREENLAND) WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE US COAST GUARD CUTTER HEALY. IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL ANALYZE THE DATA COLLECTED ON THE HEALY TO ADDRESS THE TWO QUESTIONS ABOVE. WE WILL COMBINE OUR SHIPBOARD INFORMATION WITH DATA COLLECTED BY A SMALL, SELF-PROPELLED UNDERWATER VEHICLE THAT WAS ABLE TO SAMPLE CLOSER TO THE COAST THAN THE HEALY COULD. WE WILL ALSO USE RECENT AND PAST DATA COLLECTED BY OTHER SHIPS AND WILL USE OUTPUT FROM A VERY DETAILED NUMERICAL MODEL TO COMPLEMENT OUR OBSERVATIONS. THE PROJECT WILL ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE CIRCULATION AND WIND FORCING HELP DICTATE WHERE THE SURFACE MELTWATER GOES AND HOW THE SUBSURFACE WARM WATERS ARE STEERED SHOREWARD. THE PROJECT WILL FUND A YOUNG RESEARCHER TO WORK WITH THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS. WE WILL SHARE OUR RESULTS WITH INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES ON BAFFIN ISLAND AND ORGANIZE A SCIENTIFIC WORKSHOP AT THE GREENLAND INSTITUTE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. DURING THE PAST FEW DECADES, THE AMOUNT OF FRESHWATER IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN HAS BEEN INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY AND THE MASS LOSS FROM THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET HAS BEEN ACCELERATING. MUCH OF THE FRESHWATER EXITING FRAM STRAIT (BETWEEN GREENLAND AND SVALBARD), AND MOST OF THE MELTWATER FROM GREENLAND, ENDS UP IN THE BOUNDARY CURRENT ENCIRCLING GREENLAND. FURTHERMORE, BENEATH THE SURFACE LAYER IN THE CURRENT RESIDES THE WARM AND SALTY SUBTROPICAL-ORIGIN WATER THAT HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN CAUSING BASAL MELT IN GREENLAND?S GLACIERS. IN AUTUMN 2021 THE USCGC HEALY CARRIED OUT AN EXTENSIVE HYDROGRAPHIC/VELOCITY SURVEY OF BAFFIN BAY. THIS PROJECT WILL USE THESE DATA TO ADDRESS THE FATE OF HEAT AND FRESHWATER IN THE BAY. IN ADDITION TO THE HEALY DATA, WE WILL USE CONTEMPORANEOUS GLIDER DATA AND SHIPBOARD DATA FROM THE CCS AMUNDSEN, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL HYDROGRAPHIC DATA AND OUTPUT FROM A VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION NUMERICAL MODEL. THE PROJECT WILL FUNDAMENTALLY ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF (1) THE EVOLUTION OF THE BOUNDARY CURRENT SYSTEM AS IT ENCIRCLES BAFFIN BAY; (2) THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH HEAT IS TRANSFERRED FROM THE WEST GREENLAND BOUNDARY CURRENT TO GLACIAL FJORDS VIA DEEP TROUGHS IN THE CONTINENTAL SHELF; (3) THE PARTITIONING OF FRESHWATER BETWEEN ARCTIC-ORIGIN AND GREENLAND MELTWATERS AND HOW THESE TWO COMPONENTS ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE BAY; AND (4) THE GENERAL CIRCULATION AND HYDROGRAPHY OF BAFFIN BAY, INCLUDING ITS SEASONALITY.

PHYTOPLANKTON CHLOROPHYLL-A AND PHEOPHYTIN (DEGRADED CHLOROPHYLL) CONCENTRATIONS WILL BE COLLECTED ON THE 2022 CRUISES. NASA MODIS-AQUA SATELLITE CHLOROPHYLL-A AND IN SITU PHEOPHYTIN PROPORTIONS WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP BLOOM STAGE MODELS THAT DISTINGUISH GROWING VERSUS SENESCENT BLOOMS. THE BLOOM STAGE MODEL WILL BE APPLIED TO MEASUREMENTS COLLECTED THROUGHOUT THE WATER COLUMN TO EXTRACT MORE INFORMATION FROM CRUISE SAMPLES, BROADEN THE CONTEXT OF OBSERVATIONS, AND UNDERSTAND BLOOM PROGRESSION. THE FALL BLOOM DRIVER AND PRECONDITIONING MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED USING A MACHINE LEARNING REGRESSION APPROACH. VARIABLES THAT WILL BE EXAMINED INCLUDE REMOTELY SENSED AND MODELLED DATASETS OF HIGH WIND SPEED EVENTS, WIND DIRECTION, SEA ICE BREAKUP AND FREEZE-UP DATES, AND IN SITU MEASUREMENTS OF NUTRIENTS, TEMPERATURE, SALINITY, AND STRATIFICATION.

WITH RADAR, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE A CROSS-SECTION OF THE ICE, REVEALING INTERNAL LAYERS AND THE SHAPE OF THE ROCKS UNDER THE ICE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR CALCULATING HOW MUCH POTENTIAL SEA LEVEL CHANGE IS LOCKED UP IN THE POLAR ICE SHEETS, AND HOW STABLE THE ICE SHEETS ARE LIKELY TO BE IN A WARMING WORLD. THIS TYPE OF DATA IS LOGISTICALLY CHALLENGING AND EXPENSIVE TO COLLECT. HISTORICALLY, INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH GROUPS HAVE OBTAINED FUNDING TO COLLECT THESE DATA SETS, AND THEN THE DATA LARGELY STAYED WITHIN THAT INSTITUTION. THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT PUSH TO MAKE MORE AND MORE DATA OPENLY AVAILABLE, ENABLING THE SAME DATASETS TO BE USED BY MULTIPLE RESEARCH GROUPS. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DATA IS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THERE IS NO CENTRALIZED INDEX. ADDITIONALLY, EACH GROUP RELEASES DATA IN A DIFFERENT FORMAT, WHICH CREATES AN ADDITIONAL HURDLE TO ITS USE. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES BOTH OF THOSE CHALLENGES TO DATA REUSE BY PROVIDING A UNIFIED TOOL FOR DISCOVERING WHERE ICE PENETRATING RADAR DATA ALREADY EXISTS, THEN ALLOWING THE RESEARCHER TO DOWNLOAD AND VISUALIZE THE DATA. IT IS INTEGRATED INTO OPEN-SOURCE MAPPING SOFTWARE THAT MANY IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY ALREADY USE, AND MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-EXPERTS TO EXPLORE THESE DATASETS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE FOR EARLY-CAREER RESEARCHERS AND FOR ENABLING INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK. THE US ALONE HAS SPENT MANY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DIRECT GRANTS TO ENABLE THE ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS OF POLAR ICE PENETRATING RADAR DATA, AND EVEN MORE ON THE ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT COSTS. UNFORTUNATELY, MUCH OF THESE DATA IS NOT PUBLICLY RELEASED, AND EVEN THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED IS NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL WORK INVOLVED IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO LOCATE, DOWNLOAD AND VIEW THE DATA. THIS PROJECT IS DEVELOPING A TOOL THAT WILL BOTH LOWER THE BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR USING THIS DATA AND IMPROVE THE WORKFLOWS OF EXISTING USERS. QUANTARCTICA AND QGREENLAND HAVE RAPIDLY BECOME INDISPENSABLE TOOLS FOR THE POLAR RESEARCH COMMUNITY, MAKING DIVERSE DATA SETS READILY AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS. HOWEVER, ICE PENETRATING RADAR IS A MAJOR CATEGORY OF DATA THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED ? IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE THE LOCATIONS OF EXISTING SURVEY LINES, AND THE ICE THICKNESS MAPS THAT HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED FROM THEIR DATA, BUT IT IS NOT READILY POSSIBLE TO SEE THE RADARGRAMS THEMSELVES IN CONTEXT WITH ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION. THIS CAPABILITY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS FAR MORE VISUAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN A RADARGRAM THAN SIMPLY ITS INTERPRETED BASAL ELEVATION OR ICE THICKNESS. THIS PROJECT IS DEVELOPING SOFTWARE THAT WILL ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO TO VIEW RADARGRAM IMAGES AND INTERPRETED SURFACE AND BASAL HORIZONS IN CONTEXT WITH THE EXISTING MAP-VIEW DATASETS IN QUANTARCTICA AND QGREENLAND. A DATA LAYER SHOWS THE LOCATIONS OF ALL KNOWN ICE PENETRATING RADAR SURVEYS, COLOR-CODED BASED ON AVAILABILITY. THIS LAYER ENABLES DATA DISCOVERY AND BROWSING.

THE ICECUBE DETECTOR FEATURES ONE CUBIC KILOMETER OF NATURAL ICE (AT THE DEPTH FROM 1.4 TO 2.4 KM) THAT HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A GIANT PARTICLE DETECTOR. THIS IS COMPLEMENTED BY A SURFACE ARRAY OF 162 PARTICLE DETECTORS CALLED ICETOP. BOTH THE IN-ICE AND SURFACE ARRAY DETECT ULTRA-SHORT LIGHT FLASHES FROM PARTICLE CASCADES INITIATED WHEN HIGH-ENERGY COSMIC RAYS HIT THE ATMOSPHERE. COMPLEMENTARY TO ICECUBE?S MAIN MISSION AS A NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY, THIS WORLD-UNIQUE SETUP ENABLES SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGIN OF GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS OF HIGHEST ENERGIES AND THE PARTICLE PHYSICS IN THE ATMOSPHERIC CASCADES. IN ADDITION TO RESEARCH AIMED AT FUNDAMENTAL PROGRESS IN COSMIC-RAY PHYSICS, THIS AWARD ALSO SUPPORTS SCIENTIFIC BROADER IMPACTS THROUGH ICECUBE?S COSMIC-RAY MEASUREMENTS, SUCH AS HELIOSPHERIC, SOLAR, AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE, SINCE STRATOSPHERIC AND SOLAR EVENTS CAN IMPACT THE COSMIC-RAY FLUX MEASURED BY ICECUBE. THUS, THIS AWARD ADDRESSES AND ADVANCES THE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF NSF'S WINDOWS ON THE UNIVERSE: THE ERA OF MULTI-MESSENGER ASTROPHYSICS PROGRAM AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE POLAR PROGRAM. THE MYSTIQUE OF THE SOUTH POLE ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMPELLING SCIENCE OF ICECUBE ARE AN ALLURING MIX. BESIDES ITS EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN NEWSPAPERS AND PUBLICATIONS POPULARIZING SCIENCE, ICECUBE HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB. THROUGH SUCCESSFUL HIGH SCHOOL MASTERCLASSES AS WELL AS STUDENT ENGAGEMENT IN THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, THIS PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO THE EDUCATION OF A DIVERSE STEM WORKFORCE. WITH ITS THREE-DIMENSIONAL LAYOUT, THE ICETOP SURFACE ARRAY ABOVE THE CUBIC-KILOMETER DEEP OPTICAL GRID, THE ICECUBE NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY IS ALSO AN EXCELLENT DETECTOR FOR COSMIC-RAY AIR SHOWERS. THE COMBINATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC PARTICLES AND LOW-ENERGY MUONS AT THE SURFACE AND TEV TO PEV MUONS BY THE DEEP IN-ICE GRID MAKES ICECUBE A WORLD-UNIQUE INSTRUMENT FOR THE MOST ENERGETIC GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS. COMPLEMENTING ICECUBE?S MULTIMESSENGER MISSION, THIS SETUP IS USED TO MEASURE THE COSMIC-RAY ENERGY SPECTRUM AND COMPOSITION IN THE ENERGY RANGE WHERE THE STILL-ENIGMATIC TRANSITION BETWEEN GALACTIC AND EXTRAGALACTIC COSMIC RAYS IS PRESUMED TO OCCUR. ICECUBE IS ALSO PROVIDING THE FIRST AND WORLD?S MOST SENSITIVE MEASUREMENTS OF LITTLE UNDERSTOOD COSMIC-RAY ANISOTROPIES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE AT TEV TO PEV ENERGIES. COMBINING DATA WITH THE HAWC GAMMA-RAY OBSERVATORY IN MEXICO, ICECUBE HAS ALSO COMPILED THE FIRST FULL-SKY COSMIC RAY ANISOTROPY OBSERVATION AT 10 TEV. PLANS TO PROVIDE COMBINED OBSERVATIONS AT HIGHER ENERGIES AND WITH OTHER EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS LHAASO ARE UNDERWAY. ICECUBE ALSO PLAYS A LEADING ROLE IN SCRUTINIZING HADRONIC INTERACTION MODELS OF THE PARTICLE PHYSICS IN AIR SHOWERS, IN PARTICULAR, THE FORWARD PRODUCTION OF LEPTONS. BY THIS, ICECUBE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MUON PUZZLE, A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE MEASURED MUON CONTENT OF AIR SHOWERS AND THE ONE PREDICTED BY STATE-OF-THE-ART HADRONIC INTERACTION MODELS. TO CONTINUE ICECUBE?S LEADING ROLE IN THIS ENERGY RANGE OF COSMIC-RAY PHYSICS, A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO INCREASE BOTH THE STATISTICS AND ACCURACY OF OUR DATA. THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STATISTICS RESULTS FROM ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION TIME WITH THE COMPLETE DETECTOR, BUT ALSO FROM EXPANDING THE ANALYZABLE DATA PHASE SPACE TO INCLUDE UNCONTAINED AND MORE INCLINED EVENTS. NEW EVENT RECONSTRUCTIONS APPLYING MACHINE-LEARNING TECHNIQUES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE SURFACE AND DEEP SIGNALS.

THE ICNO TRANSFORMED ONE CUBIC KILOMETER OF NATURAL ICE (AT THE DEPTH FROM 1.4 TO 2.4 KM) INTO A GIANT PARTICLE DETECTOR, THUS CREATING THE WORLD'S LARGEST NEUTRINO DETECTOR. SINCE ITS COMPLETION IN 2010, THE ICNO HAS DETECTED NEUTRINOS WITH ENERGIES SPANNING MORE THAN SIX ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, FROM 10 GEV TO BEYOND 10 PEV, IDENTIFYING FOR THE FIRST TIME NEUTRINOS REACHING US FROM OUTSIDE THE SOLAR SYSTEM. (GEV = ONE BILLION ELECTRON VOLTS; TEV = ONE TRILLION ELECTRON VOLTS; AND PEV = ONE QUADRILLION ELECTRON VOLTS.) IN 2017, THE ICNO DETECTED A NEUTRINO WITH AN ENERGY OF 290 TEV AND ITS ORIGIN WAS PINPOINTED (AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME) TO A SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 3.5 MILLION LIGHT YEARS. THIS DETECTION TRIGGERED AN EXTENSIVE CAMPAIGN INVOLVING SOME TWENTY SPACE- AND GROUND-BASED TELESCOPES THAT LAUNCHED A NEW ERA IN MULTI-MESSENGER DETECTION. WITH A DECADE OF DATA ICNO IS PRODUCING STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE ORIGIN OF COSMIC RAYS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES AT THE CENTERS OF ACTIVE GALAXIES. THE MYSTIQUE OF THE SOUTH POLE ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMPELLING SCIENCE OF ICECUBE ARE AN ALLURING MIX. BESIDES ITS EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN NEWSPAPERS AND PUBLICATIONS POPULARIZING SCIENCE, ICECUBE HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB. IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS, FOCUSED PROJECTS INCLUDE THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF A VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCE, AN ACTIVITY THAT HAS REACHED THE BETA STAGE FOR ZOONIVERSE, AND CONTENT FOR THEIR SUCCESSFUL HIGH SCHOOL MASTERCLASSES. THESE ACTIVITIES WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE TRAINING OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS BY INTEGRATING GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION WITH THE ICECUBE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATIONS, AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSES OF THE ICNO DATA. RECENTLY, WE HAVE RELEASED A DECADE OF ICECUBE NEUTRINO OBSERVATIONS TO THE PUBLIC. THE U.S. GROUPS HAVE ESTABLISHED A SOLID AND SUCCESSFUL RECORD OF ANALYZING DATA FROM ICECUBE. THIS AWARD WILL ENABLE A UNIFIED ANALYSIS PROGRAM WHICH WILL MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF INCREASINGLY INTERCONNECTED EFFORTS. THE SYNTHESIS OF INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE ASTROPHYSICAL MESSENGERS IS NOW PROVIDING A POWERFUL NEW TOOL FOR PROBING THE UNIVERSE. NEUTRINOS HAVE REVEALED THEMSELVES AS A POWERFUL COMPONENT OF MULTIMESSENGER ASTRONOMY BY REVEALING THE FIRST SITES WHERE THE HIGHEST ENERGY MESSENGERS SO FAR DETECTED FROM THE UNIVERSE ARE BORN AND ACCELERATED TO EXTREME ENERGIES POWERED BY THE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES LURKING AT THE CENTER OF ACTIVE GALAXIES.

GEOSPACE IS POPULATED BY PLASMA THAT MOSTLY ORIGINATES FROM THE SOLAR WIND. INTERACTION OF THESE TWO MAJOR PLAYERS - GEOMAGNETIC FIELD AND SOLAR WIND PLASMA PRODUCES MANY ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENA SUCH AS BEAUTIFUL IONOSPHERIC AURORAE (NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIGHTS), NATURAL ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION, FIELD-ALIGNED AND IONOSPHERIC CURRENTS, THAT PROMINENTLY APPEAR AND ARE OBSERVED IN THE POLAR AREAS WHERE THEY ARE MOST INTENSE. NATURAL RADIO EMISSIONS ARE IMPORTANT IN A BROAD RANGE OF SPACE PLASMA PHYSICS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE A MEANS OF REMOTELY SENSING PLASMA CONDITIONS AND PROCESSES, AND IN SOME CASES, THEY CONTROL ENERGY FLOWS OR DETERMINE BOUNDARIES AND ENERGY EXCHANGE IN SPACE PLASMAS. AURORAL RADIO EMISSIONS ARISE FROM THE SAME PROCESSES THAT PRODUCE EMISSIONS IN MAGNETOSPHERIC, PLANETARY, AND ASTROPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND THEREFORE COMPRISE A LABORATORY FOR STUDYING THOSE PROCESSES.

THIS EFFORT INCLUDES A FIELD CAMPAIGN COMPONENT IN 2022 THAT FEATURES ENHANCED OBSERVATIONS OF THE ANTARCTIC ATMOSPHERE IN WINTER DURING TARGETED OBSERVING PERIODS. THE PROJECT SEEKS TO IMPROVE NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION CAPABILITIES FOR BOTH RESEARCH APPLICATIONS AND WEATHER FORECASTING SUPPORT FOR THE US ANTARCTIC PROGRAM. THE PROJECT GOALS INCLUDE EVALUATING THE USE OF SPECIAL OBSERVATIONS TO IMPROVE ATMOSPHERIC MODELING, DETERMINING WHETHER THE NEW TECHNIQUE IS SUPERIOR TO EXISTING TECHNIQUES FOR ANTARCTIC ATMOSPHERIC SIMULATION AND WEATHER PREDICTION, AND ASSESS HOW WELL THE MODEL IS PERFORMING IN ITS PREDICTION OF POLAR CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION. THE PROJECT WILL ADVANCE THE FIELD BY APPLYING AN UNPRECEDENTED DATASET GATHERED IN AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION AND DETERMINING ITS BENEFIT FOR FUTURE SCIENCE AND FORECASTING. IT WILL ALSO ADVANCE THE FIELD BY EXPLORING A NEW METHOD FOR THE USE OF SUCH INFORMATION IN ATMOSPHERIC MODELS FOR THE POLAR REGIONS. THE BENEFITS ARE INCREASES IN KNOWLEDGE, IMPROVED WEATHER MODELING, AND GAINS IN THE MODEL WEATHER FORECASTING CAPABILITIES THAT THE ANTARCTIC PROGRAM RELIES ON, ALLOWING FOR ENHANCED EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY FOR ANTARCTIC OPERATIONS.

IN THIS PROJECT, THE INVESTIGATORS WILL (1) USE THE MOST RECENT GEOPHYSICAL DATASETS SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE AND COMPOSITION (HIGH-RESOLUTION SEISMIC VELOCITY MODEL, TOPOGRAPHY, SATELLITE GRAVITY), (2) COMBINE THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE DATASETS IN A TO RETRIEVE THE MOST RELIABLE MODEL OF THERMAL AND COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE, (3) TRANSLATE THE RESULTS INTO 2-DIMENSIONAL MAPS OF TEMPERATURE SLICES AND THE COMPOSITION OF IRON IN THE MANTLE,(4) COMPARE THE RESULTS WITH RESULTS FROM OTHER CONTINENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ANTARCTIC GEOLOGICAL HISTORY, AND (5) USE THE NEW THERMAL MODEL ALONG WITH ESTABLISHED ROCK RELATIONSHIPS TO ESTIMATE MANTLE VISCOSITY. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT THE THERMOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF THE LITHOSPHERE BENEATH ANTARCTICA IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE GEOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF THE CONTINENT AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO SURROUNDING GONDWANA CONTINENTS. IN ADDITION, THE THERMAL STRUCTURE CONTROLS THE SOLID EARTH RESPONSE TO GLACIAL UNLOADING, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR ICE SHEET MODELS AND THE FUTURE OF THE WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET. HOWEVER, IT IS CHALLENGING TO GET AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF TEMPERATURE AND COMPOSITION FROM ONLY SPARSE PETROLOGICAL/GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS, AND MOST PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM GEOPHYSICALLY HAVE RELIED ON SEISMIC OR GRAVITY DATA ALONE. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO USE A PROBABILISTIC JOINT INVERSION (HIGH RESOLUTION REGIONAL SEISMIC DATA, SATELLITE GRAVITY DATA, TOPOGRAPHY) AND PETROLOGICAL MODELLING APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE 3D THERMOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF THE MANTLE. THE INVERSION WILL BE CARRIED OUT USING A MARKOV-CHAIN BAYESIAN MONTE CARLO METHODOLOGY, PROVIDING QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATES OF UNCERTAINTIES. MAPPING THE 3-DIMENSIONAL THERMOCHEMICAL STRUCTURE (THERMAL AND COMPOSITION) WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THE HORIZONTAL (50-100 KM RESOLUTION) AND VERTICAL (FROM THE SURFACE DOWN TO 380 KM) VARIATIONS. THIS NEW MODEL WILL GIVE US THE TEMPERATURE VARIATION FROM THE SURFACE DOWN TO 380 KM AND THE DEGREE OF DEPLETION OF THE LITHOSPHERIC MANTLE AND THE SUB-LITHOSPHERIC MANTLE. THIS NEW MODEL WILL ALSO BE COMPARED TO RECENT MODELS OF GONDWANA TERRANES 200 MYRS TO BUILD A NEW MODEL OF THE THERMOCHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF THE CRATONIC MANTLE. THE NEW THERMAL AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURES CAN BE USED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE GEOTHERMAL HEAT FLUX BENEATH THE ICE SHEET AS WELL AS IMPROVE GLACIAL ISOSTATIC ADJUSTMENT AND ICE SHEET MODELS.

UNPRECEDENTED REDUCTIONS IN SEA ICE COVER ARE PUSHING THE ARCTIC INTO UNKNOWN CONDITIONS. AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE CRYOSPHERE ARE HIGH-LATITUDE GLACIERS, WHICH HOLD MORE THAN 99% OF THE WORLD?S FRESH WATER. THESE GLACIERS ARE INHERENTLY UNSTABLE AND THUS SENSITIVE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WE CAN LOOK TO HOW GLACIAL SYSTEMS RESPONDED TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE PAST TO BETTER UNDERSTAND FUTURE GLACIER DYNAMICS AND TO CONSTRAIN FUTURE PROJECTIONS OF GLACIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO SEA LEVEL RISE. EVIDENCE IS BUILDING IN SUPPORT OF A THICK ICE-SHEET THAT SPANNED THE ARCTIC OCEAN, POSSIBLY MULTIPLE TIMES, DURING THE PAST 130,000 YEARS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO BRING TOGETHER A DIVERSE ARRAY OF GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE FROM THE ARCTIC OCEAN AND THE SURROUNDING COASTAL PLAINS, TO EXPLORE THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF ARCTIC OCEAN GLACIATION DURING THE MID- TO LATE-PLEISTOCENE. THIS RESEARCH WILL HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHETHER AN ARCTIC OCEAN WIDE ICE SHEET EXISTED IN THE PAST, WHICH WILL IN TURN HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND FUTURE ICE SHEET CHANGES. ICE SHEETS AND ICE SHELVES AT HIGH LATITUDES ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING FUTURE GLACIER DYNAMICS BECAUSE GEOLOGIC RECORDS SUGGEST THAT THEY MAY ADVANCE AND RETREAT OUT-OF-PHASE WITH GLACIERS AT MID-LATITUDES DUE TO MOISTURE LIMITATIONS IN FULL GLACIAL CONDITIONS. AS SUCH, HIGH-LATITUDE GLACIATION MAY DISPLAY NON-INTUITIVE BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXTENT OF GLACIATION IN THE WESTERN ARCTIC OCEAN DURING THE MID TO LATE PLEISTOCENE AND TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN SOURCES OF ICE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO ICE-SHEET BUILD UP. THE PROJECT WILL BUILD A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM DATABASE OF PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF ARCTIC OCEAN GLACIATION IN THE BEAUFORT-CHUKCHI REGION, ALLOWING RESEARCHERS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT GLACIATION WAS EXTENSIVE IN THE WESTERN ARCTIC OCEAN AT SEVERAL POINTS DURING THE PLEISTOCENE.

FURTHERMORE, BOREAL REGIONS STORE HUGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON IN SOILS THAT, IF RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE, WOULD ACCELERATE GLOBAL WARMING. FREQUENT WILDFIRES IN BOREAL FORESTS LEAD TO CARBON RELEASE BY SHIFTING FOREST TO GRASSLANDS AND BY ACCELERATING PERMAFROST MELT. CLIMATE MODELS PREDICT DRAMATIC ECOSYSTEM CHANGES, WITH BOREAL FORESTS REPLACED BY EXTENSIVE GRASSLANDS AND A NEW TEMPERATE DECIDUOUS FOREST ECOSYSTEM OCCUPYING MUCH OF SIBERIA BY THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY. HOWEVER, REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN WILDFIRES AND THE SHORT TIME SPAN OF SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO VERIFY THESE MODEL PREDICTIONS. THIS PROJECT USES WARM PERIODS IN EARTH?S PAST TO TEST CLIMATE MODEL PREDICTIONS OF HYDROCLIMATE, FIRE AND, VEGETATION COVER IN SIBERIA IN WARM CLIMATES, SUCH AS EXPECTED BY THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY. MODELS WILL BE TESTED BY COMPARISON TO A RECORD OF PAST CLIMATE, VEGETATION, AND WILDFIRE OVER THE PAST 8.4 MILLION YEARS THAT IS PRESERVED IN ORGANIC AND MINERAL FOSSILS IN A DRILLCORE FROM LAKE BAIKAL, RUSSIA.

DURING THIS TIME, THE GRIS MELTED SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTING SEVERAL METERS OF SEA LEVEL RISE, BUT THE EXACT AMOUNT OF MELTING IS NOT KNOWN. THERE IS A NEED TO DEFINE THIS MORE PRECISELY BECAUSE THE GRIS IS EXPECTED CONTINUE TO MELT IN THE COMING YEARS AND THIS MELTING WILL ACCELERATE UNDER CONTINUED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE GRIS TO MELTING UNDER WARM CLIMATES CAN HELP CONSTRAIN HOW MUCH SEA LEVEL RISE COULD OCCUR BY 2100 AND BEYOND. ONE OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE INTERACTIVE MAPS ILLUSTRATING WHAT THE GRIS LOOKED LIKE THROUGH TIME, WHICH CAN BE USED FOR TEACHING AND SCIENCE COMMUNICATION. THIS PROJECT WILL USE A TECHNIQUE CALLED DATA ASSIMILATION TO ACHIEVE ITS GOAL. THIS TECHNIQUE IS COMMONLY USED FOR WEATHER FORECASTING BUT HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED YET TO RECONSTRUCT THE COUPLED EVOLUTION OF CLIMATE AND THE GRIS.

IN ADDITION TO THESE INTERNAL PROCESSES, THE ICE SHEET IN WESTERN ANTARCTICA IS MELTING DUE TO EARTHS WARMING CLIMATE AND ADDING WATER TO THE OCEAN. THESE CHANGES IN ICE MASS CAUSE ADJUSTMENTS IN ROCKS WITHIN THE EARTH'S CRUST, ALLOWING THE SURFACE TO REBOUND IN SOME LOCATIONS AND FALL IN OTHERS, ALTERING THE GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERN OF SEA-LEVEL CHANGE. HOWEVER, THE SOLID EARTH RESPONSE DEPENDS STRONGLY ON THE STRENGTH OF THE ROCKS AT A WIDE RANGE OF TIMESCALES WHICH IS NOT WELL-KNOWN AND VARIES WITH TEMPERATURE AND OTHER ROCK PROPERTIES. THIS PROJECT HAS THREE PRIMARY GOALS. (1) IT WILL ASSESS HOW PROCESSES SUCH AS RIFTING, MANTLE UPWELLING AND LITHOSPHERIC INSTABILITY HAVE ALTERED THE LITHOSPHERE AND UNDERLYING ASTHENOSPHERE OF WESTERN ANTARCTICA, CONTRIBUTING TO A PLANET-WIDE UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PROCESSES. (2) IT WILL USE NEW MEASUREMENTS OF MANTLE AND CRUST PROPERTIES TO ESTIMATE THE RATE AT WHICH HEAT FROM THE SOLID EARTH FLOWS INTO THE BASE OF THE ICE, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR MODELING THE RATES AT WHICH THE ICE MELTS AND FLOWS. (3) IT WILL PLACES BOUNDS ON MANTLE VISCOSITY, WHICH IS KEY FOR MODELING THE INTERACTION OF THE SOLID EARTH WITH CHANGING ICE AND WATER MASSES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR SEA-LEVEL RISE. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS, NEW RESOLUTION OF CRUST AND MANTLE STRUCTURE WILL BE OBTAINED BY ANALYZING SEISMIC WAVES FROM DISTANT EARTHQUAKES THAT HAVE BEEN RECORDED AT NUMEROUS SEISMIC STATIONS IN ANTARCTICA. THESE ANALYSES WILL INCLUDE NEW COMBINATIONS OF SEISMIC WAVE DATA THAT PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ABOUT MANTLE TEMPERATURE, HEAT FLOW AND VISCOSITY. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES TO A BROWN UNIVERSITY GRADUATE STUDENT, UNDERGRADUATES FROM GROUPS UNDERREPRESENTED IN SCIENCE WHO WILL COME TO BROWN UNIVERSITY FOR A SUMMER RESEARCH PROGRAM, AND OTHER UNDERGRADUATES. THE PROJECT WILL BRING TOGETHER FACULTY AND STUDENTS FOR A SEMINAR AT BROWN THAT EXPLORES THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE SOLID EARTH AND ICE PROCESSES IN ANTARCTICA. PROJECT RESEARCH WILL BE INCORPORATED IN OUTREACH TO LOCAL PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS. THIS RESEARCH ADDRESSES KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT MANTLE PROCESSES AND PROPERTIES IN WESTERN ANTARCTICA. WHAT ARE THE RELATIVE IMPACTS OF RIFTING, MANTLE PLUMES, AND LITHOSPHERIC DELAMINATION IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE LITHOSPHERE AND ASTHENOSPHERE? WHERE IS TOPOGRAPHY ISOSTATICALLY COMPENSATED, AND WHERE ARE DYNAMIC PROCESSES SUCH AS PLATE FLEXURE OR TRACTIONS FROM 3-D MANTLE FLOW REQUIRED? WHAT ARE THE BOUNDS ON HEAT FLOW AND MANTLE VISCOSITY, WHICH REPRESENT IMPORTANT INPUTS TO MODELS OF ICE SHEET EVOLUTION AND ITS FEEDBACK FROM THE SOLID EARTH? TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS, THIS PROJECT WILL MEASURE MANTLE AND CRUST PROPERTIES USING SEISMIC TOOLS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN APPLIED IN ANTARCTICA: REGIONAL-SCALE MEASUREMENT OF MANTLE ATTENUATION FROM SURFACE WAVES; SP BODY WAVE PHASES TO IMAGE MANTLE VELOCITY GRADIENTS SUCH AS THE LITHOSPHERE-ASTHENOSPHERE BOUNDARY; AND SURFACE WAVE AMPLIFICATION AND ELLIPTICITY. THE RESULTING MODELS OF SEISMIC ATTENUATION AND VELOCITY WILL BE JOINTLY INTERPRETED TO SHED NEW LIGHT ON TEMPERATURE, BULK COMPOSITION, VOLATILE CONTENT, AND PARTIAL MELT, USING A RANGE OF LABORATORY-DERIVED CONSTITUTIVE LAWS, WHILE CONSIDERING DATA FROM MANTLE XENOLITHS. TO TEST THE RELATIVE ROLES OF RIFTING, MANTLE PLUMES, AND DELAMINATION, AND TO ASSESS ISOSTATIC SUPPORT FOR ANTARCTIC TOPOGRAPHY, THE PREDICTIONS OF THESE PROCESSES WILL BE COMPARED TO THE NEW MODELS OF CRUST AND MANTLE PROPERTIES. TO IMPROVE BOUNDS ON WESTERN ANTARCTIC HEAT FLOW, SEISMIC ATTENUATION AND VELOCITY WILL BE USED IN EMPIRICAL COMPARISONS AND IN DIRECT MODELING OF VERTICAL TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS. TO BETTER MEASURE MANTLE VISCOSITY AT THE TIMESCALES OF GLACIAL ISOSTATIC ADJUSTMENT, FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT VISCOSITY WILL BE ESTIMATED FROM THE INFERRED MANTLE CONDITIONS.

THESE STUDIES RELY ON ACCURATE DATING OF FEATURES LEFT BEHIND BY THE PAST ICE SHEETS. THE MOST COMMONLY USED METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE AGE OF THESE FEATURES OVER THE LAST ~40,000 YEARS IS RADIOCARBON DATING. HOWEVER, RADIOCARBON DATING IS NOT WITHOUT ITS NUANCES, WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED AROUND ANTARCTICA. ONE OF THESE NUANCES IS DETERMINING THE OFFSET BETWEEN THE MATERIALS MEASURED RADIOCARBON AGE AND ITS TRUE AGE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO USE HISTORICALLY HARVESTED WHALE BONES FROM THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA, WHOSE AGE IS INDEPENDENTLY KNOWN, TO DETERMINE THAT OFFSET. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT OFFSET WILL ALLOW MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF PAST RATES OF ICE SHEET AND SEA-LEVEL CHANGES ACROSS THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA OVER THE LAST ~40,000 YEARS.

THE WHALE BONES ARE FROM SPECIMENS HARVESTED AT THE TURN OF THE 20TH CENTURY PRIOR TO NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE 1950S. THUS, THEIR RADIOCARBON AGE WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE NEW CONSTRAINTS ON THE RADIOCARBON RESERVOIR FOR SHALLOW WATERS AROUND ANTARCTICA. AN ADDED BENEFIT OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT GIVEN THE DNA DETERMINATION, WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THAT RADIOCARBON RESERVOIR VARIES ACROSS THREE SPECIES OF WHALES, THUS TESTING THE COMMON ASSUMPTION THAT THE RADIOCARBON RESERVOIR DOES NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS DIFFERENT SPECIES.

THE GENERALLY NORTHWARD FLOW THROUGH THE STRAIT IS A KEY SOURCE OF OCEANIC HEAT, FRESHWATER, AND NUTRIENTS FOR THE ARCTIC, INFLUENCING THE UPPER ~200M OF ROUGHLY HALF OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN. THIS PROVIDES BOTH A STRATIFIED UPPER OCEAN LAYER, WHICH PROTECTS SEA-ICE FROM DEEPER AND WARMER ATLANTIC ORIGIN WATERS, AND A MAJOR SOURCE OF NUTRIENTS WHICH FUEL ARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS. OCEANIC HEAT CARRIED NORTHWARD THROUGH THE STRAIT ACTS AS A TRIGGER FOR WESTERN ARCTIC SEA-ICE MELT AND IS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF SEA-ICE RETREAT DATE IN THE CHUKCHI SEA, THE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE, SHALLOW SEA IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF THE STRAIT. THE FRESHNESS OF THE FLOW MAY INFLUENCE OCEAN CIRCULATION AS FAR AWAY AS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. TO UNDERSTAND AND QUANTIFY HOW THE CLIMATE AND ECOSYSTEMS OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN AND THE ALASKAN ARCTIC SEAS ARE CHANGING, AND HOW THOSE CHANGES RELATE TO THE REST OF THE GLOBE, OBSERVATIONS ARE NEEDED TO QUANTIFY THE CHANGING PROPERTIES OF THE FLOW THROUGH THE BERING STRAIT. YEAR-ROUND OCEANOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS IN THE STRAIT (FROM MOORINGS, I.E., INSTRUMENTS MOORED TO THE SEA-FLOOR) STARTED IN 1990 AND SHOW THE FLOW IS INCREASING IN STRENGTH AND TEMPERATURE, AND FRESHENING DRAMATICALLY IN WINTER. THESE CHANGES ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE ARCTIC AND BEYOND. ADDITIONALLY, SATELLITE STUDIES, WHICH ARE INDICATING LARGE INCREASES AT THE BASE OF THE ARCTIC FOOD CHAIN, SUGGEST AN INCREASED NUTRIENT FLUX FROM THE PACIFIC OCEAN THROUGH THE STRAIT. HOWEVER, TO DATE, NO YEAR-ROUND OR INTERANNUAL MEASUREMENTS OF NUTRIENT FLOW THROUGH THE BERING STRAIT EXIST TO TEST THIS IDEA. SINCE MOORINGS ARE STILL THE ONLY VIABLE WAY OF MEASURING SEASONAL AND INTERANNUAL CHANGE IN THE BERING STRAIT, THIS PROJECT SUPPORTS: FOUR YEARS OF MOORINGS, MEASURING PHYSICAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS FLOW, TEMPERATURE, SALINITY, SEA-ICE; BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES INCLUDING NUTRIENT CONTENT AND MEASURES OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY; AND ACCOMPANYING ANALYSIS AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. THE LATTER INCLUDE MAKING DATA PRODUCTS AND RESULTS AVAILABLE TO SCIENCE, PUBLIC, AND INDUSTRY COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS BRINGING BERING STRAIT AND ARCTIC SCIENCE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC, UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, AND SCHOOLS, INCLUDING BERING STRAIT COMMUNITIES AND PUBLIC AND HISPANIC/LATINO-DOMINATED SCHOOLS IN SEATTLE WA. FROM SEPTEMBER 2022 TO SEPTEMBER 2026, THREE YEAR-ROUND MOORINGS WILL BE DEPLOYED IN THE US WATERS OF THE BERING STRAIT REGION, SUPPORTED BY ANNUAL SHIP-BASED SERVICING, AND ACCOMPANYING HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS IN THE BERING STRAIT AND SOUTHERN CHUKCHI SEA. HOURLY MOORING MEASUREMENTS WILL BE USED TO COMPUTE WATER PROPERTIES, AND FLUXES OF HEAT, FRESHWATER, AND NITRATE INTO THE ARCTIC. THESE IN SITU MEASUREMENTS WILL BE COMBINED WITH SATELLITE DATA, NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION MODEL DATA, AND VERIFIED ARCTIC MODEL RESULTS TO INVESTIGATE CAUSES OF CHANGE IN THE THROUGHFLOW, AND TO UNDERSTAND AND QUANTIFY TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE CHUKCHI SEA, THUS GIVING A BETTER ESTIMATION OF THE FORCINGS OF THE BERING STRAIT THROUGHFLOW DIRECTLY ON THE ARCTIC OCEAN. THE PROJECT AIMS TO OBTAIN THE BERING STRAIT?S FIRST YEAR-ROUND MEASUREMENTS OF NITRATE, THE KEY LIMITING NUTRIENT OF THE REGION, AND, BY EXTENDING THE LONGEST IN SITU PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT RECORD FROM THE ARCTIC OCEAN, GIVE A MULTIDECADAL MEASURE OF CHANGE IN THIS KEY ARCTIC GATEWAY.

AS ALGAL GROWTH IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN ABSORBING CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE, UNDERSTANDING WHAT CONTROLS PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ROLE THE SOUTHERN OCEAN PLAYS IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE. THIS STUDY PROPOSES TO STUDY THE ALGAL PROCESSES THAT TAKE UP MANGANESE IN ANTARCTIC DIATOMS, ONE OF THE MAIN PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN THE REGION. ANOTHER ASPECT WILL BE TO UNDERSTAND HOW ZINC, A MICRONUTRIENT WITH SIMILAR DYNAMICS THAN MANGANESE, CAN INHIBIT ITS UPTAKE. THE PIS PROPOSE LAB EXPERIMENTS WITH CULTURED DIATOMS ISOLATED FROM THE SOUTHERN OCEAN TO OBTAIN ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS ON MICRONUTRIENT DYNAMICS AND WILL COMPARE RESULTS FROM THOSE OBTAINED WITH A DIATOM SPECIES ISOLATED FROM TEMPERATE WATERS.

THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH TO EXPLORE MANGANESE (MN) LIMITATION IN ANTARCTIC DIATOMS BY TWO EARLY CAREER INVESTIGATORS. DIATOMS ARE CENTRAL PLAYERS IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN CARBON CYCLE, WHERE THE MICRONUTRIENT CHEMISTRY IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER OCEANS. THE SOUTHERN OCEAN IS CHARACTERIZED BY WIDESPREAD LOW MN, COUPLED WITH HIGH ZINC (ZN). HIGH ZN LEVELS ARE POTENTIALLY TOXIC TO DIATOMS AS ZN CAN COMPETITIVELY INHIBIT MN UPTAKE AND METABOLISM, COMPROMISING THE ABILITY OF BUILDING CRITICAL CELLULAR COMPONENTS, THUS IMPACTING THE BIOLOGICAL PUMP. USING CULTURE EXPERIMENTS WITH A MATRIX OF MICRONUTRIENT TREATMENTS (MN, ZN, FE) AND IRRADIANCES, AND USING PHYSIOLOGICAL AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC APPROACHES, ALONG WITH BIOCHEMICAL PRINCIPLES, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS WILL ADDRESS THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS (DIATOMS FROM THE SOUTHERN OCEAN POSSESS PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS TO LOW MN/HIGH ZN) TO QUANTIFY RATES OF UPTAKE AND TRANSPORTER BINDING CONSTANTS.

THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT MANGANESE ALSO PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING ALGAL GROWTH AND IF FOUND IN LOW CONCENTRATIONS CAN PLAY A ROLE IN LIMITING PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. AS ALGAL GROWTH IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN ABSORBING CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE, UNDERSTANDING WHAT CONTROLS PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ROLE THE SOUTHERN OCEAN PLAYS IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE. THIS STUDY PROPOSES TO STUDY THE ALGAL PROCESSES THAT TAKE UP MANGANESE IN ANTARCTIC DIATOMS, ONE OF THE MAIN PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN THE REGION. ANOTHER ASPECT WILL BE TO UNDERSTAND HOW ZINC, A MICRONUTRIENT WITH SIMILAR DYNAMICS THAN MANGANESE, CAN INHIBIT ITS UPTAKE. THE PIS PROPOSE LAB EXPERIMENTS WITH CULTURED DIATOMS ISOLATED FROM THE SOUTHERN OCEAN TO OBTAIN ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS ON MICRONUTRIENT DYNAMICS AND WILL COMPARE RESULTS FROM THOSE OBTAINED WITH A DIATOM SPECIES ISOLATED FROM TEMPERATE WATERS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BENEFIT NSF?S GOALS OF UNDERSTANDING LIFE IN COLD ENVIRONMENTS AND HOW THEY DIFFER FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE OCEAN. THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPORT TWO FIRST-TIME EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS AND A FEMALE RESEARCHER IN EARTH SCIENCES. TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL ALSO BE SUPPORTED, AND SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUES USED IN THIS RESEARCH WILL BE SHARED AT OPEN HOUSES SPONSORED BY THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND WITH LOCAL SUMMER SCHOOLS. THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH TO EXPLORE MANGANESE (MN) LIMITATION IN ANTARCTIC DIATOMS BY TWO EARLY CAREER INVESTIGATORS. DIATOMS ARE CENTRAL PLAYERS IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN CARBON CYCLE, WHERE THE MICRONUTRIENT CHEMISTRY IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER OCEANS. THE SOUTHERN OCEAN IS CHARACTERIZED BY WIDESPREAD LOW MN, COUPLED WITH HIGH ZINC (ZN). HIGH ZN LEVELS ARE POTENTIALLY TOXIC TO DIATOMS AS ZN CAN COMPETITIVELY INHIBIT MN UPTAKE AND METABOLISM, COMPROMISING THE ABILITY OF BUILDING CRITICAL CELLULAR COMPONENTS, THUS IMPACTING THE BIOLOGICAL PUMP. USING CULTURE EXPERIMENTS WITH A MATRIX OF MICRONUTRIENT TREATMENTS (MN, ZN, FE) AND IRRADIANCES, AND USING PHYSIOLOGICAL AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC APPROACHES, ALONG WITH BIOCHEMICAL PRINCIPLES, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS WILL ADDRESS THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS (DIATOMS FROM THE SOUTHERN OCEAN POSSESS PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS TO LOW MN/HIGH ZN) TO QUANTIFY RATES OF UPTAKE AND TRANSPORTER BINDING CONSTANTS.

A KEY DRIVER OF ICE LOSS IN THE POLAR REGIONS IS THE WAVE-INDUCED EROSION OF ICEBERGS, GLACIERS, AND ICE-SHELF FRONTS. WHILE RAPID PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN UNDERSTANDING A NUMBER OF ICE DECAY PROCESSES, WAVE EROSION AT THE WATERLINE OF ICE CLIFFS HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN DETAIL. THIS PROJECT WILL CONDUCT AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF WAVE EROSION IN A LABORATORY SETTING, WITH THE GOAL TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHT ON HOW ICE CLIFFS ERODE AND IMPROVE THE REPRESENTATION OF THESE PROCESSES IN LARGE-SCALE OCEAN AND CLIMATE SIMULATIONS. THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON ICEBERGS SINCE WAVE EROSION IS MOST IMPACTFUL IN THE OPEN OCEAN ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER, MANY OF THE FINDINGS WILL APPLY DIRECTLY TO GLACIER AND ICE-SHELF FRONTS. IN ADDITION TO ITS SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE, THE PROJECT WILL TRAIN TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE FOREFRONT OF CLIMATE SCIENCE. A FURTHER AIM IS TO CONSTRUCT A BASIC WAVE FLUME FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AND INVOLVE K-12 TEACHERS IN THE STUDY THROUGH SUMMER RESEARCH EXPERIENCES. HOW ICE CLIFFS DECAY IS ONE OF THE MOST ARDENTLY RESEARCHED QUESTIONS IN THE CRYOSPHERE. A KEY DRIVER OF ICE LOSS THAT HAS GARNERED RELATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION IN THIS CONTEXT IS WAVE-INDUCED EROSION. WAVE ACTION AT THE SIDES OF ICEBERGS AND AT THE FRONTS OF WATER-TERMINATING GLACIERS AND ICE SHELVES CAN CAUSE ICE LOSS IN SEVERAL WAYS: (I) WAVES MIX MELTWATER AND AMBIENT WATER, EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT HEAT TOWARD THE ICE, AND ACCELERATE MELT AT THE WATERLINE. (II) THE RESULTANT INCISIONS AT THE WATERLINE CAN LEAD TO FAILURE OF THE OVERHANGING ICE CLIFF. (III) THE REMAINING SUBMERGED ICE IS BUOYANT, AND THE INDUCED STRESSES CAN TRIGGER FULL-DEPTH CALVING EVENTS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CONDUCT THE FIRST DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF THESE PROCESSES IN A LABORATORY SETTING, WHICH WILL BE USED TO GUIDE NEW THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REVISED ICEBERG EROSION PARAMETERIZATION TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN MODELS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS WORK ARE TWO-FOLD: (1) TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS OF WAVE EROSION AND DERIVE THEORETICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MELT RATES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. (2) TO DEVELOP A DECAY PARAMETERIZATION THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE PROCESSES (I)-(III) ABOVE WITH THE AIM TO REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH ICE LOSS IN MODEL PROJECTIONS. THIS CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT NEXT STEP TOWARD THE LARGER GOAL OF MORE ACCURATE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS AND IMPROVED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE SEA LEVEL RISE.

WATER MASSES ENTERING THE WEDDELL GYRE ARE MODIFIED AS THEY MOVE IN A GREAT CIRCULAR ROUTE AROUND THE GYRE MARGIN AND CHANGE THROUGH PROCESSES INVOLVING AIR-SEA-CRYOSPHERE INTERACTIONS AS WELL AS THROUGH OCEAN EDDIES THAT MIX PROPERTIES ACROSS THE GYRE BOUNDARIES. SOME OF THE DENSER WATER MASSES EXIT THE GYRE THROUGH PATHWAYS ALONG THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY, AND ULTIMATELY VENTILATE THE GLOBAL DEEP OCEAN AS ANTARCTIC BOTTOM WATER. WHILE IN-SITU AND SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS, AS WELL AS COMPUTER MODELING EFFORTS, PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF THE LARGE-SCALE AVERAGE FLOW WITHIN THE GYRE, DETAILS OF THE SMALLER-SCALE, OR MESOSCALE EDDY FLOW REMAIN ELUSIVE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL QUANTIFY MIXING DUE TO MESOSCALE EDDIES WITHIN THE WEDDELL GYRE, AS WELL AS THE TRANSPORT OF INCOMING DEEP WATER FROM THE NORTHEAST, THOUGHT TO BE A RESULT OF TRANSIENT EDDIES. SINCE THE WEDDELL GYRE PRODUCES SOURCE WATER FOR ABOUT 40% OF ANTARCTIC BOTTOM WATER FORMATION, UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS IN THIS REGION HELPS TO IDENTIFY CAUSES OF DOCUMENTED CHANGES IN GLOBAL BOTTOM WATERS. THIS IN TURN, WILL GIVE INSIGHT INTO HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS AFFECTING GLOBAL OCEANS, THROUGH MODIFICATION OF DENSE POLAR WATERS AND ANTARCTIC BOTTOM WATER CHARACTERISTICS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO TRACK 153 RAFOS-ENABLED ARGO FLOATS IN THE ICE-COVERED REGIONS OF THE WEDDELL GYRE. THE RESULTANT TRACKS ALONG WITH ALL AVAILABLE ARGO AND EARLIER FLOAT DATA WILL BE USED TO CALCULATE EULERIAN AND LAGRANGIAN MEANS AND EDDY STATISTICS FOR THE WEDDELL GYRE. THE STUDY WILL LINK RAFOS TRACKS WITH ARGO PROFILES UNDER ICE, ALLOWING ONE TO CHARACTERIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EDDIES IN WATER COLUMN MODIFICATION AT CRITICAL ICE-EDGE BOUNDARIES AND LEADS. WITH RAFOS TRACKS NEAR THE NORTHEASTERN LIMIT OF THE GYRE, THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE EDDY-DRIVEN PROCESSES OF INCOMING CIRCUMPOLAR DEEP WATER, TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE MECHANISMS AND VOLUME FLUXES INVOLVED. PREVIOUS WORK SHOWS THAT A LARGE FRACTION OF THE MEAN CIRCULATION IN THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN LIMITS OF THE GYRE, WHERE IT CONTACTS THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT, OCCURS IN A NARROW BOUNDARY LAYER ABOVE THE SLOPE. THE RESEARCH HERE WILL INTEGRATE THIS FLOW STRUCTURE INTO A COMPLETE INTERIOR AND BOUNDARY LAYER MEAN CIRCULATION SYNTHESIS. THE FINDINGS AND PRODUCTS FROM THE PROPOSED WORK WILL IMPROVE THE POSITIONING OF ARGO PROFILES IN THE POLAR REGIONS, WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE ACCURATE CLIMATOLOGICAL MAPS AND DERIVED QUANTITIES.

WHILE THE NUTRIENTS UNDERNEATH GLACIERS ARE KNOWN TO BE IMPORTANT FOR NEARBY BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES, COMPARATIVELY LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CHEMISTRY AND IMPORTANCE OF GLACIER SURFACES AND SNOWPACK, WHICH CAN TRAP DUST - SMALL PARTICLES OF ROCK THAT ARE DEPOSITED BY WIND AND WITH SNOWFALL. THE DUST IS DARKER THAN ICE AND SNOW AND THEREFORE CAN WARM DURING SUNNY PERIODS AND MELT THE SURROUNDING FROZEN WATER, GENERATING SMALL AMOUNTS OF LIQUID WATER. DURING CLOUDY AND COLD PERIODS, SOLAR RADIATION CAN NO LONGER HEAT THE PARTICLES AND THE LIQUID WATER AROUND THE DUST FREEZES AGAIN. THESE THAWING AND FREEZING CYCLES CAN BREAK DOWN THE DUST AND RELEASE NUTRIENTS, SUCH AS IRON, WHICH CAN POTENTIALLY BE USED BY ORGANISMS IN THE ICE OR CAN BE TRANSPORTED TO STREAMS, LAKES, AND/OR THE OCEAN DURING PERIODS OF HIGH MELT. THIS RESEARCH WILL COMBINE COMPUTER MODELING AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO UNDERSTAND 1) WHAT HAPPENS (CHEMICALLY AND PHYSICALLY) TO GLACIER AND SNOWPACK DUST DURING FREEZING AND THAWING AND 2) HOW TO MODEL FREEZING AND THAWING OF WATER AND DUST IN GLACIER ICE. TWO TRAVELING EXHIBITS EXPLORING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SCIENCE AND ART WILL RESULT FROM THIS PROJECT, ALLOWING FOR DIVERSE AUDIENCES TO CONNECT WITH THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT AND UNDERSTAND HOW SMALL-SCALE SCIENCE INFLUENCES LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE THE GEOCHEMISTRY OF GLACIAL MELTWATER DUE TO FREEZING AND THAWING, AND WHETHER THE MELTWATER CONTAINS CRITICAL NUTRIENTS FOR SURROUNDING ECOSYSTEMS. DESPITE LOW TEMPERATURES AND THE RELATIVE SCARCITY OF LIQUID WATER, GLACIAL SYSTEMS CAN BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF TRACE METALS, NUTRIENTS AND OTHER WEATHERING PRODUCTS TO PROGLACIAL AND MARINE SYSTEMS. WHILE THE IMPORTANCE OF WEATHERING HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SUBGLACIAL AND PROGLACIAL ENVIRONMENTS, LESS IS UNDERSTOOD ABOUT WEATHERING MECHANISMS OR THE COMPOSITION OF MAJOR AND TRACE NUTRIENTS AT THE MOST UPSTREAM SOURCE: WITHIN SNOW AND SUPRAGLACIAL ICE. WIND DEPOSITS FINE-GRAINED SEDIMENT ON ICE SURFACES, WHICH CAN THEN MELT OR BECOME INCORPORATED INTO THE ICE PROFILE AND EXPERIENCE A RANGE OF THERMAL REGIMES AND FREEZE-THAW CONDITIONS. DAILY FREEZE-THAW CYCLING DRIVES PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL WEATHERING OF SEDIMENT GRAINS, YET FEW STUDIES HAVE EXPLICITLY EXAMINED THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF FREEZE-THAW CYCLES AND HOW THEY CONTROL MAJOR ION AND TRACE METAL RELEASE, ALTERATION, AND MOBILITY.

SOCIETY WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT BY EDUCATION OF 2 GRADUATE STUDENTS, UNDERGRADUATES AND K-12 STUDENTS AS WELL AS INCREASE PUBLIC LITERACY THROUGH SHORT VIDEOS PRODUCTION SHARED IN YOUTUBE. THE PIS PROPOSE TO ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF POLAR MICROBIAL COMMUNITY FUNCTION, BY MEASURING ENZYME AND GENE FUNCTION OF COMPLEX ORGANIC MATTER DEGRADATION IN SEVERAL OCEAN REGIONS, PROVIDING A CIRCUM-ANTARCTIC DESCRIPTION OF SEDIMENT PROCESSES. TWO HYPOTHESES ARE PROPOSED. THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS STATES THAT MANY GENES FOR THE DEGRADATION OF COMPLEX ORGANIC MATTER WILL BE SHARED IN SEDIMENTS THROUGHOUT A SAMPLING TRANSECT AND THAT WHERE VARIATIONS IN GENE CONTENT OCCUR, IT WILL REFLECT DIFFERENCES IN THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF ORGANIC MATTER, NOT REGIONAL VARIABILITY. THE SECOND HYPOTHESIS STATES THAT A FRACTION OF GENE TRANSCRIPTS FOR ORGANIC MATTER DEGRADATION WILL NOT RESULT IN MEASURABLE ENZYME ACTIVITY DUE TO POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION OR RAPID DEGRADATION OF THE ENZYMES. THE PIS WILL ANALYZE SEDIMENT CORES ALREADY COLLECTED IN A 2020 CRUISE TO THE WESTERN ANTARCTIC PENINSULA WITH THE ADDITIONAL REQUEST OF PARTICIPATING IN A CRUISE IN 2023 TO EAST ANTARCTICA. THE PIS WILL ANALYZE SEDIMENTS FOR METAGENOMICS, META-TRANSCRIPTOMICS, AND METABOLOMICS COUPLED WITH GEOCHEMICAL DATA AND ENZYME ASSAYS TO ESTABLISH MICROBIAL DEGRADATION OF COMPLEX ORGANIC MATTER IN ANTARCTIC SEDIMENTS. ORGANIC CARBON CONCENTRATIONS AND CONTENT IN SEDIMENTS WILL BE MEASURED WITH ?13C, ?15N, TOC POREWATER FLUORESCENCE IN BULK ORGANIC CARBON. COMBINED WITH DETERMINATION OF GEOGRAPHICAL VARIABILITY AS WELL AS DEPENDENCE ON CARBON SOURCES, RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY COULD PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR NEW HYPOTHESES ON HOW CLIMATE VARIABILITY, WITH INCREASED WATER TEMPERATURE, AFFECTS GEOCHEMISTRY IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN.

THIS ICE SHEET MASS LOSS IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE THINNING, RETREAT, AND ACCELERATION OF GLACIERS IN CONTACT WITH THE OCEAN. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FIELD AND SATELLITES INDICATE THAT GLACIERS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES AT THE ICE-OCEAN INTERFACE AND THAT THE INCREASE IN SUBMARINE MELTING IS LIKELY TO BE DRIVEN BY THE DISCHARGE OF MELTWATER FROM UNDERNEATH THE GLACIER KNOWN AS SUBGLACIAL MELTWATER PLUMES. THE MELTING OF GLACIER ICE ALSO DIRECTLY ADDS A LARGE VOLUME OF FRESHWATER INTO THE OCEAN, POTENTIALLY CAUSING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CIRCULATION OF OCEAN WATERS THAT REGULATE GLOBAL HEAT TRANSPORT, MAKING ICE-OCEAN INTERACTIONS AN IMPORTANT POTENTIAL FACTOR IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND VARIABILITY. THE ABILITY TO PREDICT, AND HENCE ADEQUATELY RESPOND TO, CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEA-LEVEL RISE THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SMALL-SCALE PROCESSES OCCURRING IN THE VICINITY OF SUBGLACIAL MELTWATER PLUMES AT THE ICE-OCEAN INTERFACE. CURRENTLY, UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICS IS INCOMPLETE; FOR EXAMPLE, DIFFERENT MODELS OF GLACIER-OCEAN INTERACTION COULD YIELD MELTING RATES THAT VARY OVER A FACTOR OF FIVE FOR THE SAME HEAT SUPPLY FROM THE OCEAN. IT IS THEN VERY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF PREDICTIVE MODELS. THIS PROJECT WILL USE COMPREHENSIVE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY HOW THE MELT RATES OF GLACIERS IN THE VICINITY OF PLUMES ARE AFFECTED BY THE ICE ROUGHNESS, ICE GEOMETRY, OCEAN TURBULENCE, AND OCEAN DENSITY STRATIFICATION AT THE ICE-OCEAN INTERFACE. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL THEN BE USED TO DEVELOP NEW AND IMPROVED PREDICTIVE MODELS OF ICE-SHEET MELTING BY THE OCEAN. THIS PROJECT BUILDS BRIDGES BETWEEN MODERN EXPERIMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS AND GLACIOLOGY WITH THE GOAL OF LEADING TO ADVANCES IN BOTH FIELDS. AS A PART OF THIS WORK, TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING AND EACH YEAR TWO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BE TRAINED IN EXPERIMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS TO ASSIST IN THIS WORK AND DEVELOP THEIR OWN RESEARCH PROJECTS. THIS PROJECT CONSISTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR STUDYING THE MELT RATES OF GLACIER ICE UNDER THE COMBINED INFLUENCES OF (1) TURBULENCE OCCURRING NEAR AND AT THE ICE-OCEAN INTERFACE, (2) DENSITY STRATIFICATION IN THE AMBIENT WATER COLUMN, (3) IRREGULARITIES IN THE BOTTOM TOPOLOGY OF AN ICE SHELF, AND (4) DIFFERING SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF MULTIPLE MELTWATER PLUMES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE EXPERIMENTS IS TO OBTAIN HIGH-RESOLUTION DATA OF THE VELOCITY, DENSITY, AND TEMPERATURE NEAR/AT THE ICE-OCEAN INTERFACE, WHICH WILL THEN BE USED TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF MELT PROCESSES DOWN TO SCALES OF MILLIMETERS, AND TO DEVISE NEW, MORE ROBUST NUMERICAL MODELS OF GLACIER EVOLUTION AND SEA-LEVEL RISE. SPECIALLY, LASER-BASED, OPTICAL TECHNIQUES IN EXPERIMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS (PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCITY AND LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE) WILL BE USED TO GATHER THE DATA, AND THE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED USING REFRACTIVE-INDEX MATCHING TECHNIQUES TO ELIMINATE CHANGES IN REFRACTIVE INDICES THAT COULD OTHERWISE BIAS THE MEASUREMENTS. THE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE RUN INSIDE A CLIMATE-CONTROLLED COLD ROOM TO MIMIC FIELD CONDITIONS (OCEAN TEMPERATURE FROM 0-10 DEGREES C). THE PROJECT WILL USE 3D-PRINTING TO CREATE DIFFERENT CASTING MOLDS FOR MAKING ICE BLOCKS WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROUGHNESS. THE GOAL IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW ICE MELT RATE CHANGES AS A FUNCTION OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE PLUME, THE AMBIENT OCEAN WATER, AND THE GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE ICE INTERFACE.

TECHNICAL THE AREA WITHIN 300 KM OF THE SOUTH POLE AND ITS SUB-ICE STRUCTURES ARE EQUALLY, IF NOT MORE, CRITICAL IN STUDYING ANTARCTIC EARTH SCIENCES. GIVEN ITS GATEWAY LOCALITY BETWEEN THE HIGH SOUTHERN TRANSANTARCTIC MOUNTAINS AND EAST ANTARCTIC CRATON, THE AREA IS CRITICAL FOR STUDYING GEOLOGICAL HISTORY AND MODERN TECTONISM OF THE CONTINENT, MODELING CONTINENTAL DYNAMICS, AND DEVELOPING MORE ACCURATE ICE SHEET DYNAMIC MODELS TO PREDICT THEIR RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, THESE PROPERTIES HAVE NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY STUDIED DUE TO BOTH THE REMOTENESS OF THE CONTINENT AND ITS THICK ICE COVERAGE. IN THIS PROPOSED STUDY, THE TEAM WILL DEPLOY ~ 180 HIGH-FREQUENCY 3-COMPONENT PORTABLE SEISMIC NODES AND EIGHT BROADBAND SENSORS NEAR THE SOUTH POLE, ENCOMPASSING THE NEARBY SOUTHERN TRANSANTARCTIC MOUNTAINS AND THE POLAR SUBGLACIAL BASINS. A COMBINATION OF LINEAR NODAL ARRAYS AND 2-DIMENSIONAL BROADBAND ARRAYS WILL PROVIDE BOTH SPATIAL COVERAGE AND THE CAPABILITY TO RESOLVE HIGH-RESOLUTION SUBSURFACE STRUCTURAL VARIATIONS. ONCE THE DATA ARE COLLECTED THE TEAM WILL APPLY A SUITE OF DATA PROCESSING SCHEMES TAILORED FOR THE ARRAY AND STUDY AREA, INCLUDING 1) A COMPREHENSIVE SURFACE WAVE ANALYSIS THAT DETERMINES BOTH THE ISOTROPIC AND ANISOTROPIC STRUCTURE OF ITS CRUST AND UPPERMOST MANTLE; 2) 2-LAYER RECEIVER FUNCTION ANALYSIS THAT MEASURES SUB-ICE LAYERING AND POISSON?S RATIO; 3) A JOINT SURFACE WAVE AND RECEIVE FUNCTION INVERSION THAT BUILDS SEISMIC MODELS WITH UNCERTAINTIES; 4) A NOVEL CRUSTAL COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS WHICH USES THE SEISMIC ATTRIBUTES TO QUANTIFY THE SILICA CONTENT OF THE CRUST, AND 5) A JOINT MONTE CARLO THERMAL INVERSION THAT COMBINES CURIE-DEPTH MEASUREMENTS WITH SEISMOLOGICALLY CONSTRAINED CRUSTAL HEAT GENERATION TO CONSTRUCT A SELF-CONSISTENT, UNIFORM CRUSTAL GEOTHERMS. THIS RESEARCH IS COMPLEMENTED BY A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT THAT PROVIDES HIGH-QUALITY EARTH SCIENCE EDUCATION TO GRADUATE STUDENTS, AS WELL AS TO HIGH-NEED K-12 SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN LONG ISLAND.

ANY PROCESS THAT SPEEDS UP OR SLOWS DOWN THE RATE AT WHICH THESE ICE STREAMS MOVE CAN APPRECIABLY IMPACT THE BALANCE BETWEEN ICE GAIN AND LOSS IN ANTARCTICA, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES WORLDWIDE. PROCESSES THAT CAN LEAD TO ICE-STREAM ACCELERATION ARE FREQUENTLY STUDIED, WHEREAS ICE-STREAM STAGNATION, WHICH MOST RECENTLY OCCURRED IN ANTARCTICA ABOUT 180 YEARS AGO, IS STUDIED LESS OFTEN. THIS PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE TWO DECADES OF EXISTING DATA FROM FIELD EXPERIMENTS IN ANTARCTICA ON A DECELERATING ICE STREAM. THE TEAM WILL RE-PROCESS THESE DATASETS FROM FIVE DIFFERENT NSF-FUNDED PROJECTS USING MODERN GEOPHYSICAL METHODS TO BUILD LONG TIME-SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS THAT PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO ICE-SHEET PROCESSES AND TEST HYPOTHESES ABOUT HOW STAGNATION OCCURS.

PERMAFROST OCCURS UNDER APPROXIMATELY ONE FOURTH OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE'S LAND SURFACE AND CONTAINS AS MUCH CARBON (STORED AS UNDECOMPOSED ORGANIC MATERIAL) AS THE ENTIRE ATMOSPHERE. WHEN PERMAFROST THAWS, MICROORGANISMS (SUCH AS FUNGI AND BACTERIA) DECOMPOSE AND CONVERT THIS ORGANIC MATERIAL TO CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE, TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GREENHOUSE GASES IN OUR ATMOSPHERE. THIS MECHANISM IS REFERRED TO AS POSITIVE CLIMATE FEEDBACK BECAUSE THE WARMING OF PERMAFROST GENERATES HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH INCREASES ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES EVEN FURTHER. THIS PERMAFROST?CLIMATE FEEDBACK IS ONE OF THE LEAST WELL-UNDERSTOOD GLOBAL CLIMATE FEEDBACKS, PARTIALLY DUE TO OUR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF PERMAFROST MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES. THERE IS LIMITED DATA ABOUT HOW PERMAFROST THAW AFFECTS THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY?OR MICROBIOME?INCLUDING THE ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES UNDERPINNING THE COMPOSITION OF THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY AFTER PERMAFROST THAWS. NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES ARE NOT ONLY SHAPED BY THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY LIVE, BUT THAT RANDOM CHANCE?OR COINCIDENCE?ALSO DETERMINES WHICH MICROBES ARE PRESENT AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THE DEGREE OF COINCIDENCE INFLUENCES OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT MICROBIOMES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL DEEPEN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT ARE SHAPING THE POST-THAW COMPOSITION AND ACTIVITY OF SOIL MICROORGANISMS. AT THE SAME TIME THIS PROJECT WILL TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF POLAR RESEARCHERS (AT THE POSTDOCTORAL, GRADUATE, AND UNDERGRADUATE LEVELS) AND BUILD A NETWORK OF PERMAFROST MICROBIOLOGISTS ABLE TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ROLE OF MICROORGANISMS IN THE PERMAFROST?CLIMATE FEEDBACK. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE POORLY KNOWN DYNAMICS OF POST-THAW MICROBIOMES IN PERMAFROST LANDSCAPES, WHICH ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING DUE TO THE AMPLIFICATION OF ARCTIC CLIMATE WARMING. THE GOAL OF THE WORK IS TO ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP THROUGH A SERIES OF HEAVILY INTEGRATED RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND BROADER IMPACTS ACTIVITIES. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL (1) SYNTHESIZE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND AS-YET-UNPUBLISHED DNA SEQUENCE DATA ON POST-THAW MICROBIOMES FROM PERMAFROST ACROSS THE GLOBE; (2) USE ECOLOGICAL MODELING TO ASSESS THE CONTRIBUTION OF STOCHASTICITY TO THE POST-THAW MICROBIOME COMPOSITION OVER SPACE, TIME, AND DISTURBANCE INTENSITY USING A FIELD SAMPLING APPROACH; (3) TEST MECHANISMS OF ASSEMBLY IN POST-THAW MICROBIOMES IN HIGHLY CONTROLLED LABORATORY INCUBATIONS PERFORMED ACROSS MANY ECOLOGICAL AXES; (4) EQUIP THE NEXT GENERATION OF ARCTIC SCHOLARS AND/OR NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGERS WITH THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO EXCEL IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, NETWORKING AND COLLABORATION, AND SCIENCE COMMUNICATION BY TRAINING A POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER, A PHD STUDENT, AND UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS; (5) DEVELOP A PROFESSIONAL NETWORK OF PERMAFROST MICROBIAL ECOLOGISTS TO ELUCIDATE THE COMPLEX UNKNOWNS OF PERMAFROST AND POST-THAW MICROBIOMES; AND (6) SUPPORT EFFORTS TO CONTINUE WORK IN MAKING POLAR AND BIOGEOSCIENCES MORE DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE.

SNOW PROCESSES ARE ESPECIALLY RELEVANT IN THE ARCTIC SYSTEM, WHERE TEMPERATURES ARE RISING MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE GLOBAL AVERAGE, PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF FEEDBACK PROCESSES THAT TAKE PLACE AS SNOW MELTS. AS AIR TEMPERATURES INCREASE, SNOW BEGINS TO MELT, WHICH LOWERS THE SNOW?S REFLECTIVITY AND INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT IT ABSORBS. THE ABSORBED LIGHT LEADS TO FURTHER TEMPERATURE INCREASE, AND THIS WARMING PROCESS CAN HAVE FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR CLIMATE. ALTHOUGH SNOW IS ONE OF NATURE?S MOST REFLECTIVE MATERIALS, THE EXACT REFLECTIVITY CAN BE QUITE VARIABLE. SEVERAL FACTORS DARKEN SNOW, SUCH AS LARGER SNOW GRAIN SIZES AND IMPURITIES IN THE SNOW LIKE DUST, SOOT AND ALGAE. ONE FACTOR THAT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD IS HOW THE LIQUID WATER CONTENT IN SNOW REDUCES REFLECTIVITY. THIS PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN DETERMINING HOW CHANGING SNOWPACKS WILL IMPACT THE CLIMATE SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY IN THE ARCTIC, AS WET SNOW BECOMES MORE PREVALENT DUE TO MORE FREQUENT RAIN ON SNOW EVENTS AND LARGER EXTENT AND DURATION OF SURFACE MELT ON ICE SHEETS AND GLACIERS. THIS PROJECT WILL ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WET SNOW REFLECTIVITY THROUGH FIELD MEASUREMENTS IN MINNESOTA AND COLORADO, LAB EXPERIMENTS, AND MODELING. OUR RESULTS WILL PROBE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND THEREFORE, BROADLY APPLY TO COLD REGIONS. AS PART OF THIS WORK, UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BE ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH PROJECTS. THEY WILL COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA IN AN ENGINEERING THERMODYNAMICS CLASS AND WILL DESIGN AND BUILD INSTRUMENTATION FOR THIS WORK AND TO SUPPORT OTHER FACULTY PROJECTS IN A NEW ENGINEERING FELLOWS PROGRAM. THE INVESTIGATOR WILL ALSO SHARE TEACHING MATERIALS ABOUT SNOW REFLECTIVITY AND CLIMATE ONLINE AND AT A WORKSHOP FOR FACULTY AT MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS. THE NATURALLY HIGH ALBEDO (OR REFLECTIVITY) OF SNOW PROVIDES A STRONG CONTROL ON EARTH?S SURFACE TEMPERATURES. BECAUSE OF THIS CRITICAL ROLE, ACCURATELY REPRODUCING SNOW ALBEDO IS ESSENTIAL FOR EFFECTIVE CLIMATE MODELING. EVEN IN THE ARCTIC, THE ALREADY PREVALENT PERIODS OF WET SNOW ARE INCREASING BECAUSE OF MORE FREQUENT RAIN ON SNOW EVENTS AND INCREASED EXTENT AND DURATION OF GLACIAL SURFACE MELT; HOWEVER, NEARLY ALL EXISTING SNOW ALBEDO MODELS EMPLOY ALBEDO SCHEMES DESIGNED FOR DRY SNOW. THESE MODELS PLAY A KEY ROLE DURING SNOW MELT BECAUSE OF THE AMPLIFYING EFFECTS OF THE SNOW ALBEDO FEEDBACK PROCESS, WHERE MELTING SNOW LEADS TO LOWER ALBEDO, HIGHER TEMPERATURES, AND FURTHER SNOW MELT. THEREFORE, EXPLICITLY INCORPORATING THE EFFECTS OF LIQUID WATER CONTENT ON SNOW ALBEDO IS A CRITICAL NEXT STEP IN IMPROVING MODEL ACCURACY. THE PROPOSED WORK AIMS TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECT OF LIQUID WATER CONTENT ON SNOW ALBEDO, COMBINING SEVERAL APPROACHES. 1) THE INVESTIGATOR WILL CONDUCT FIELD-BASED MEASUREMENTS OF ALBEDO, LIQUID WATER CONTENT, GRAIN SIZE AND SNOW IMPURITIES IN MINNESOTA AND AT NIWOT RIDGE IN COLORADO TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES ON THE OVERALL SNOW ALBEDO. WET SNOW CONDITIONS AT THESE LOCATIONS REPRESENT THOSE THAT ARE INCREASINGLY COMMON IN THE ARCTIC. 2) THROUGH A NEW COURSE-BASED UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE (CURE) IMPLEMENTED IN THE ENGINEERING THERMODYNAMICS CLASS, STUDENTS WILL CONDUCT LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS OF THE REFLECTANCE OF ARTIFICIAL SNOW WITH CONTROLLED GRAIN SIZE AND LIQUID WATER CONTENT. 3) THE INVESTIGATOR WILL COMPLEMENT THIS WORK WITH TWO DIFFERENT MODELING APPROACHES TO CALCULATE WET SNOW ALBEDO TO INVESTIGATE AN ARRAY OF SNOW CONDITIONS AND INFORM POTENTIAL CHANGES TO PHYSICALLY BASED SNOW ALBEDO MODELS. STUDYING THESE PHENOMENA IN DIFFERENT LANDSCAPES, IN THE LABORATORY, AND IN SIMULATIONS WILL ALLOW US TO EXTRAPOLATE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WET SNOW ALBEDO TO COLD REGIONS MORE BROADLY, PARTICULARLY IN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING ARCTIC.

IN AREAS WITH PERMAFROST, WETLANDS CAN DEVELOP WHEN PERMAFROST THAWS AND THE LAND SUBSIDES. THIS PROCESS CREATES A LANDSCAPE WITH POCKETS OF LOW-ELEVATION WETLANDS COUCHED WITHIN HIGHER ELEVATION PERMAFROST PLATEAUS. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES HOW THE FLOW OF WATER FROM PERMAFROST PLATEAUS INTO WETLANDS AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF METHANE EMITTED FROM THE WETLANDS. IT MAY BE THAT THE WATER TRANSPORTS THERMAL ENERGY AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE PERMAFROST PLATEAU INTO THE WETLAND, THAT SUPPORT METHANE PRODUCTION. THIS PROJECT COULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY RESEARCHERS STUDY AND MODEL WETLAND METHANE EMISSIONS. THE PROJECT RESEARCHERS WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE FOSTERING SCIENCE AND CLIMATE SCHOLARS PROGRAMS AT UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS TO CREATE EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, AND YOUTHS IN FOSTER CARE IN THE STATE OF ALASKA. PREVIOUS RESEARCH AT A THAW BOG IN INTERIOR ALASKA SHOWED THAT SPRING RAINFALL FACILITATED ABOUT 30% INCREASE IN METHANE EMISSIONS. SOIL WATER FROM THE PERMAFROST-PLATEAU FLOWED INTO THE BOG AND RAPIDLY WARMED BOG SOILS, STIMULATING MICROBIAL AND PLANT PROCESSES THAT ENHANCED METHANE EMISSIONS. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT HOW THE PLATEAU-BOG HYDROLOGIC CONNECTION CAN INFLUENCE METHANE. HOWEVER, MANY ASPECTS OF THIS CONNECTION REMAIN UNCLEAR. MOST NOTABLY, THE PREVIOUS STUDY CAPTURED TWO OF THE RAINIEST YEARS ON RECORD, BUT BOG METHANE EMISSIONS ONLY INCREASED IN ONE OF THE TWO YEARS. THEREFORE, TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTION OF METHANE EMISSIONS FROM NORTHERN LATITUDES, THE SCIENTISTS WILL: 1) DETERMINE THE METEOROLOGICAL, SOIL AND ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS WITHIN THE PERMAFROST PLATEAU THAT FACILITATE TRANSPORT OF THERMAL ENERGY AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE PLATEAU INTO THE BOG, 2) IDENTIFY IF AND WHEN THESE INPUTS AFFECT BOG METHANE EMISSIONS, AND 3) ASSESS HOW WINTER CONDITIONS IMPACT THESE PROCESSES. THESE TASKS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY CONDUCTING FIELDWORK AND BY USING A HYDROLOGIC MODEL TO EXAMINE HISTORIC DATA FROM MULTIPLE DIFFERENT THERMOKARST BOGS TO IDENTIFY THE SUBSET OF PROCESSES AND CONDITIONS THAT FACILITATE PLATEAU-BOG TRANSPORT AND ENHANCE BOG METHANE EMISSIONS.

THE RESEARCH PLAN IS INTEGRATED WITH A COLLABORATIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT AIMS TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN POLAR SCIENCE FOR HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PRONE TO BE IMPACTED BY SEA-LEVEL RISE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE GOAL OF THIS CAREER PROPOSAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBILITY AND IMPLICATIONS OF AN INTERNAL SHEAR BAND FORMING IN ICE FLOWING OVER ROUGH TOPOGRAPHY BY DEVELOPING A SUITE OF CUSTOMIZED NUMERICAL MODELS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE AS OPEN-SOURCE TOOLS TO THE GLACIOLOGICAL COMMUNITY FOR USAGE AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THE TEAM HYPOTHESIZES THAT ICE FLOWING OVER A HARD BED WITH ROUGH TOPOGRAPHY IN THE NON-CAVITATING LIMIT MAY EXPERIENCE SUFFICIENT STRAIN LOCALIZATION IN THE ICE JUST ABOVE TOPOGRAPHIC HIGHS TO FORM AN INTERNAL SHEAR BAND THROUGH CREEP INSTABILITY DESPITE ADVECTIVE COOLING AS THE ICE THINS AND ACCELERATES. THE DEFORMATION IN THIS INTERNAL SHEAR BAND IS HIGHLY LOCALIZED AND REMINISCENT OF SLIDING, HIGHLIGHTING THAT FLOW AND SLIDING MAY BE END MEMBERS THAT ARE CONNECTED BY A SPECTRUM OF INCREASINGLY LOCALIZED ENGLACIAL DEFORMATION. THE TEAM WILL TEST ITS HYPOTHESIS THROUGH A THREE-STEP PROCESS BY (1) IDENTIFYING THE NONDIMENSIONAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR INTERNAL-SHEAR BAND FORMATION FOR A BED WITH AN IDEALIZED TOPOGRAPHY, (2) GENERALIZING INSIGHTS TO BEDS WITH MORE REALISTIC, FRACTAL BED TOPOGRAPHY AND COMPARING RESULTS TO EXISTING FIELD OBSERVATIONS, AND (3) PRODUCING CONTINENTAL-SCALE ASSESSMENTS OF WHERE AN INTERNAL SHEAR BAND COULD FORM FOR BOTH GREENLAND AND ANTARCTICA.

WITH HIGH VARIABILITY IN SEA ICE FORMATION AND MELT BETWEEN YEARS AND AS A RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, IT IS OF IMPORTANCE TO OBTAIN BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERACTION OF SEA ICE WITH ALGAE, AS WELL AS PROVIDE BETTER DATA FOR GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS. THIS PROJECT WILL ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS BY MEASURING PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH AND CELLULAR PROPERTIES IN SEA ICE WITH EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED USING AN ICE TANK. LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WILL BE BASED ON PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS IN THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA COASTAL WATERS, PROVIDING REALISTIC CONDITIONS TO EMULATE. THE SCIENTIFIC IMPORTANCE OF THE PROPOSED WORK ALIGNS WITH THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GOALS TO UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SEA ICE BIO-GEO-CHEMISTRY AND ITS FEEDBACKS WITH SEASONAL SEA ICE DYNAMICS AND CLIMATE. THE FINDING FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE OF INTEREST TO A BROAD SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, INCLUDING OCEANOGRAPHERS, BIOLOGISTS, CHEMISTS, AND ECOSYSTEM AND OCEAN MODELERS. TO ADDRESS THE SCARCITY OF DATA ON SEA ICE MICROBES THAT LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT FUTURE ANTARCTIC CLIMATE WITH ACCURACY, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR WILL DEVELOP AN ANTARCTIC SCIENCE MINOR IN ORDER TO TRAIN FUTURE SCIENTISTS WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE AND PREPARE THE FUTURE US WORKFORCE WITH A STRONG SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND ON EARTH AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES. THERE IS A PAUCITY OF DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES UNDERLYING OBSERVED PATTERS IN SEA ICE QUALITY AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE SEA-ICE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF PRIMARY PRODUCTION AND PHYSIOLOGY OF SYMPAGIC ALGAE OVER THE SEASONAL CYCLE OF FORMATION AND MELT OF ANTARCTIC SEA ICE. ALTHOUGH SEA ICE IS CENTRAL TO THE ANTARCTIC COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS, LITTLE IS KNOWN OF HOW THEY AFFECT, AND ARE IN TURN AFFECTED, BY SEA-ICE ALGAE. THIS PROJECT CONCENTRATES ON FIRST-YEAR SEA ICE, FORMING AND MELTING EACH YEAR, CREATING UNIQUE AND VERY DYNAMIC HABITATS. THE STUDY WILL BE STRUCTURED BY 4 MAIN OBJECTIVES: 1) HOW DIFFERENT ALGAL SPECIES ADAPT TO THE SEASONAL CHANGES IN SEA ICE CONDITIONS, 2) HOW DIFFERENT METHODS TO MEASURE PRIMARY PRODUCTION (CARBON DIOXIDE DRAWDOWN, OXYGEN PRODUCTION AND VARIABLE FLUORESCENCE) RELATE IN SEA ICE AND DIFFER FROM SEA WATER MEASUREMENTS, 3) HOW SYMPAGIC ALGAE INFLUENCE THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF SEA ICE, 4) HOW SYMPAGIC ALGAE CONTRIBUTE TO ORGANIC MATTER CYCLING DURING ICE MELT. DUE TO EXPECTED CHANGES IN SEA ICE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, THIS STUDY IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO PROVIDE NEEDED DATA ON SHORT-TERM AND SEASONAL PROCESSES.

IN AREAS WITH PERMAFROST, WETLANDS CAN DEVELOP WHEN PERMAFROST THAWS AND THE LAND SUBSIDES. THIS PROCESS CREATES A LANDSCAPE WITH POCKETS OF LOW-ELEVATION WETLANDS COUCHED WITHIN HIGHER ELEVATION PERMAFROST PLATEAUS. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES HOW THE FLOW OF WATER FROM PERMAFROST PLATEAUS INTO WETLANDS AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF METHANE EMITTED FROM THE WETLANDS. IT MAY BE THAT THE WATER TRANSPORTS THERMAL ENERGY AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE PERMAFROST PLATEAU INTO THE WETLAND, THAT SUPPORT METHANE PRODUCTION. THIS PROJECT COULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY RESEARCHERS STUDY AND MODEL WETLAND METHANE EMISSIONS. THE PROJECT RESEARCHERS WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE FOSTERING SCIENCE AND CLIMATE SCHOLARS PROGRAMS AT UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS TO CREATE EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, AND YOUTHS IN FOSTER CARE IN THE STATE OF ALASKA. PREVIOUS RESEARCH AT A THAW BOG IN INTERIOR ALASKA SHOWED THAT SPRING RAINFALL FACILITATED ABOUT 30% INCREASE IN METHANE EMISSIONS. SOIL WATER FROM THE PERMAFROST-PLATEAU FLOWED INTO THE BOG AND RAPIDLY WARMED BOG SOILS, STIMULATING MICROBIAL AND PLANT PROCESSES THAT ENHANCED METHANE EMISSIONS. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT HOW THE PLATEAU-BOG HYDROLOGIC CONNECTION CAN INFLUENCE METHANE. HOWEVER, MANY ASPECTS OF THIS CONNECTION REMAIN UNCLEAR. MOST NOTABLY, THE PREVIOUS STUDY CAPTURED TWO OF THE RAINIEST YEARS ON RECORD, BUT BOG METHANE EMISSIONS ONLY INCREASED IN ONE OF THE TWO YEARS. THEREFORE, TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTION OF METHANE EMISSIONS FROM NORTHERN LATITUDES, THE SCIENTISTS WILL: 1) DETERMINE THE METEOROLOGICAL, SOIL AND ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS WITHIN THE PERMAFROST PLATEAU THAT FACILITATE TRANSPORT OF THERMAL ENERGY AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE PLATEAU INTO THE BOG, 2) IDENTIFY IF AND WHEN THESE INPUTS AFFECT BOG METHANE EMISSIONS, AND 3) ASSESS HOW WINTER CONDITIONS IMPACT THESE PROCESSES. THESE TASKS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY CONDUCTING FIELDWORK AND BY USING A HYDROLOGIC MODEL TO EXAMINE HISTORIC DATA FROM MULTIPLE DIFFERENT THERMOKARST BOGS TO IDENTIFY THE SUBSET OF PROCESSES AND CONDITIONS THAT FACILITATE PLATEAU-BOG TRANSPORT AND ENHANCE BOG METHANE EMISSIONS. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL THEN LOOK FOR THE CO-OCCURRENCE OF THESE PROCESSES AND CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE THERMOKARST WETLAND LANDSCAPE AND UPDATE METHANE MODELS TO APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO IDENTIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES.

THIS PROJECT INVOLVES TWO INTERCONNECTED PARTS: DOCUMENTING KEY STRUCTURES HAVING TO DO WITH TIME IN THE LANGUAGE, AND TRAINING NATIVE SPEAKERS, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF LINGUISTICS AND COMMUNITY-CENTERED LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION. THE SENTENCE STRUCTURE AND MEANING OF TENSE AND RELATED NOTIONS IN THIS LANGUAGE, WHICH LACKS REQUIRED TENSE MARKING ON VERBS, ARE UNDER-DOCUMENTED AND POORLY UNDERSTOOD BY LINGUISTS. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE SINCE TENSE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THEORIES OF LANGUAGE.

THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS TO THOROUGHLY DOCUMENT THE MORPHOSYNTAX AND SEMANTICS OF TENSE- AND ASPECT-LIKE CONTRASTS IN THE LANGUAGE VIA FIELDWORK WITH NATIVE SPEAKERS AND TO ANALYZE THESE CONTRASTS WITHIN A GENERATIVE FRAMEWORK. DOCUMENTATION WILL TAKE THE FORM OF ELICITATION WITH CULTURALLY-SPECIFIC STORYBOARDS, RECORDING OF NARRATIVES AND CONVERSATIONS, AND TARGETED ELICITATION. TOPICS FOR CONVERSATION PROMPTS WILL BE DETERMINED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION GROUP, SO THAT DOCUMENTATION OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED SIMULTANEOUSLY.

IT IS THE MOST PRODUCTIVE STRETCH OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN, SUPPORTING AN ARRAY OF MARINE LIFE, INCLUDING ANTARCTIC TOOTHFISH ? THE REGION?S TOP FISH PREDATOR. WHILE A COMMERCIAL FISHERY FOR TOOTHFISH CONTINUES TO GROW IN THE ROSS SEA, FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE GAPS REMAIN REGARDING TOOTHFISH ECOLOGY AND THE IMPACTS OF TOOTHFISH FISHING ON THE BROADER ROSS SEA ECOSYSTEM. RECOGNIZING THE GLOBAL VALUE OF THE ROSS SEA, A LARGE (>2 MILLION KM2) MARINE PROTECTED AREA WAS ADOPTED BY THE MULTI-NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES IN 2016. THIS RESEARCH WILL FILL A CRITICAL GAP IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF ANTARCTIC TOOTHFISH AND DEEPEN UNDERSTANDING OF BIOLOGICAL-PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS FOR FISH ECOLOGY, WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO KNOWLEDGE OF IMPACTS OF FISHING AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE ON THE ROSS SEA SYSTEM. THIS WORK WILL FURTHER PROVIDE INNOVATIVE TOOLS FOR STUDYING CONNECTIVITY AMONG GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTINCT FISH POPULATIONS AND FOR SYNTHESIZING AND ASSESSING THE EFFICACY OF A LARGE-SCALE MARINE PROTECTED AREA. IN DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROGRAM IN ENGAGED SCHOLARSHIP, THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCHOLARS TO ENGAGE ACROSS THE SCIENCE-POLICY-PUBLIC INTERFACE, ENGAGE WITH SOUTHERN OCEAN STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE RESEARCH PROCESS, AND TO DEEPEN THE PUBLIC?S APPRECIATION OF THE ANTARCTIC. A MAJOR RESEARCH PRIORITY AMONG ROSS SEA SCIENTISTS IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE ANTARCTIC TOOTHFISH AND TEST THE EFFICACY OF THE ROSS SEA MARINE PROTECTED AREA (MPA) IN PROTECTING AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF OVERFISHING AND CLIMATE CHANGE. LIKE GROWTH RINGS OF A TREE, FISH EAR BONES, CALLED OTOLITHS, DEVELOP ANNUAL LAYERS OF CALCIUM CARBONATE THAT INCORPORATES ELEMENTS FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT. OTOLITHS OFFER INFORMATION ON THE FISH?S GROWTH AND THE SURROUNDING OCEAN CONDITIONS.

THE PROJECT WILL MEASURE LIFE HISTORY PARAMETERS AS WELL AS TRACE ELEMENTS AND STABLE ISOTOPES IN OTOLITHS IN THREE DISTINCT SETS COLLECTED OVER THE LAST FOUR DECADES IN THE ROSS SEA. THE INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO QUANTIFY THE TRANSPORT PATHWAYS ANTARCTIC TOOTHFISH USE ACROSS THEIR LIFE HISTORY, AND ACROSS TIME, IN THE ROSS SEA. THE PROJECT WILL ASSESS IF TOOTHFISH POPULATIONS FROM THE ROSS SEA ARE CONNECTED MORE WIDELY ACROSS THE ANTARCTIC. BY COMPARING LIFE HISTORY AND OTOLITH CHEMISTRY DATA ACROSS TIME, THE RESEARCHERS WILL ASSESS CHANGE IN LIFE HISTORY PARAMETERS AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS AND SEEK TO INFER IF THESE CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY FISHING OR CLIMATE CHANGE. SPATIALLY MAPPING OF THESE DATA WILL ALLOW AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFICACY OF THE ROSS SEA MPA IN PROTECTING TOOTHFISH AND WHERE FURTHER PROTECTIONS MIGHT BE NEEDED.

THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL MECHANISMS THAT DETERMINE THE LOCATION, STRENGTH, EVOLUTION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ARCTIC CYCLONES (ACS) AND TROPOPAUSE POLAR VORTICES (TPVS), AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR INFLUENCING SEA ICE BREAK-UP AND DECLINE. TPVS ARE AN IMPORTANT PRECURSOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION OF ACS AND ARE ALSO ONE OF THE LONGEST-LIVED FEATURES IN THE EARTH?S LOWER ATMOSPHERE. YET THEIR LOCATIONS IN DATA-SPARSE REGIONS OF THE ARCTIC AND THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL SPATIAL SCALE MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE AND UNDERSTAND THEIR DETAILED STRUCTURE AND RESULTING IMPACTS ON THE EARTH?S CLIMATE. FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN THE DYNAMICS OF CYCLONES IN MIDDLE LATITUDES AND THE ARCTIC. FOR EXAMPLE, ATMOSPHERIC VORTICES RATHER THAN WAVES PLAY A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CYCLONE LIFECYCLES AND RADIATIVE PROCESSES HAVE INCREASED IMPORTANCE IN MAINTAINING AND STRENGTHENING TPVS. THUS, THE CORRECT TREATMENT OF CLOUD AND RADIATIVE PROCESSES IN MODELS IS LIKELY CRITICAL TO ACCURATELY DEFINING THE STRUCTURE AND INTENSITY OF TPVS AND ACS.

THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL MECHANISMS THAT DETERMINE THE LOCATION, STRENGTH, EVOLUTION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ARCTIC CYCLONES (ACS) AND TROPOPAUSE POLAR VORTICES (TPVS), AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR INFLUENCING SEA ICE BREAK-UP AND DECLINE. TPVS ARE AN IMPORTANT PRECURSOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION OF ACS AND ARE ALSO ONE OF THE LONGEST-LIVED FEATURES IN THE EARTH?S LOWER ATMOSPHERE. YET THEIR LOCATIONS IN DATA-SPARSE REGIONS OF THE ARCTIC AND THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL SPATIAL SCALE MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE AND UNDERSTAND THEIR DETAILED STRUCTURE AND RESULTING IMPACTS ON THE EARTH?S CLIMATE. FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN THE DYNAMICS OF CYCLONES IN MIDDLE LATITUDES AND THE ARCTIC. FOR EXAMPLE, ATMOSPHERIC VORTICES RATHER THAN WAVES PLAY A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CYCLONE LIFECYCLES AND RADIATIVE PROCESSES HAVE INCREASED IMPORTANCE IN MAINTAINING AND STRENGTHENING TPVS.

LONG-TERM RECORDS OF PAST ICE MELT HELP SCIENTISTS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ICE MELT, SUCH AS SUMMER AIR TEMPERATURES AND THE CONCENTRATION OF SOOT AND OTHER PARTICLES IN THE ICE THAT ABSORB SUNLIGHT. IN PARTICULAR, PAST WARM PERIODS ARE IMPORTANT TO STUDY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE POTENTIAL ANALOGS FOR OUR FUTURE CLIMATE. ONE METHOD TO RECONSTRUCT PAST SURFACE MELT IS THROUGH VISUAL DETECTION OF BUBBLE-FREE LAYERS. HOWEVER, BEYOND APPROXIMATELY 5000 YEARS, THE MELT LAYERS ARE NO LONGER VISIBLE BECAUSE THE ICE LAYERS GET STRONGLY THINNED BY ICE FLOW AND BECAUSE THE AIR BUBBLES DISSOLVE INTO THE ICE CRYSTALS. THIS AWARD SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW TECHNIQUE TO RECONSTRUCT PAST MELT IN ARCTIC ICE CORES AND THE APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE TO STUDY PAST WARM PERIODS IN ARCTIC ICE CORES FROM GREENLAND AND ALASKA.

THE RESEARCHERS WILL DEVELOP LESSON MATERIALS ON ICE CORES AND CLIMATE CHANGE FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM UNDERSERVED REGIONS, HOST TWO STEM TEACHER WORKSHOPS AT OSU, AND TO SUPPORT STUDENT CLUBS ACROSS OREGON RURAL COMMUNITIES. GLACIER ICE CORES PRESERVE A RECORD OF PAST SURFACE MELTING THAT CAN BE USED FOR UNDERSTANDING PAST VARIABILITY IN MELT INTENSITY IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE FORCING - EITHER NATURAL OR ANTHROPOGENIC. RESEARCHERS HAVE TRADITIONALLY RECONSTRUCTED PAST SURFACE MELT IN ICE CORES USING VISUAL DETECTION OF BUBBLE-FREE LAYERS. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS METHOD DOES NOT WORK FOR OLD AND/OR DEEP ICE, WHERE MELT LAYERS CAN NO LONGER BE VISUALLY IDENTIFIED. THE INVESTIGATOR WILL APPLY A NEW ICE CORE PROXY FOR SURFACE MELT INTENSITY: THE XENON/NITROGEN RATIO. IN THE ABSENCE OF REFROZEN MELTWATER, THE XENON/NITROGEN RATIO IN ICE SAMPLES REFLECTS THE ATMOSPHERIC RATIO. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE HIGH SOLUBILITY OF XENON, THE XENON/NITROGEN RATIO BECOMES STRONGLY ENRICHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SURFACE MELT. THE INVESTIGATOR WILL USE THIS PROXY TO ADDRESS FOUR IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT IS THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF THE HOLOCENE THERMAL MAXIMUM IN THE ARCTIC; (2) WHAT IS THE EXTENT AND MAGNITUDE OF GREENLAND MELT DURING THE LAST INTERGLACIAL PERIOD; (3) WHAT ARE THE DRIVERS OF ARCTIC MELT ON LONG TIME SCALES; AND (4) HOW DO CURRENT MELT RATES IN THE ARCTIC COMPARE TO THE LAST 10,000 YEARS. THE INVESTIGATOR PROPOSES MEASUREMENTS ON THE RENLAND AND GISP2 ICE CORES (BOTH FROM GREENLAND), AND THE MT. HUNTER ICE CORE (FROM ALASKA).

THESE TECHNIQUES ARE NECESSARY FOR DETERMINING HOW LARGE THE POLAR ICE SHEETS WERE IN THE GEOLOGIC PAST, INCLUDING DURING PAST PERIODS OF WARM CLIMATE THAT LIKELY RESEMBLE PRESENT AND NEAR-FUTURE CONDITIONS. THUS, THEY REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT TECHNICAL CAPABILITY NEEDED FOR ESTIMATING THE RESPONSE OF POLAR ICE SHEETS TO CLIMATE WARMING.

THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON SEVERAL AREAS OF COSMOGENIC-NUCLIDE GEOCHEMISTRY, WHICH IS A GEOCHEMICAL DATING METHOD THAT RELIES ON THE PRODUCTION AND DECAY OF COSMIC-RAY-PRODUCED RADIONUCLIDES IN SURFACE ROCKS. MEASUREMENTS OF THESE NUCLIDES CAN BE USED TO QUANTIFY THE DURATION OF SURFACE EXPOSURE AND ICE COVER AT LOCATIONS IN ANTARCTICA THAT ARE COVERED AND UNCOVERED BY CHANGES IN THE SIZE OF THE ANTARCTIC ICE SHEETS, THUS PROVIDING A MEANS OF RECONSTRUCTING PAST ICE-SHEET CHANGE.

A SECOND SET OF EXPERIMENTS WILL FOCUS ON MEANS OF IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING NON-COSMOGENIC BACKGROUND INVENTORIES OF SOME RELEVANT NUCLIDES, WHICH IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE MEASUREMENT SENSITIVITY AND PRECISION FOR COSMIC-RAY-PRODUCED INVENTORIES OF THESE NUCLIDES. A THIRD FOCUS AREA AIMS TO IMPROVE CAPABILITIES TO MEASURE MULTIPLE COSMIC-RAY-PRODUCED NUCLIDES IN THE SAME SAMPLE, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF DATING METHODS BASED ON THESE NUCLIDES AND TO EXPAND THE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THESE METHODS CAN BE APPLIED. IF SUCCESSFUL, THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE LIKELY TO IMPROVE A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS OF COSMOGENIC-NUCLIDE GEOCHEMISTRY RELEVANT TO ANTARCTIC RESEARCH, INCLUDING SUBGLACIAL BEDROCK EXPOSURE DATING, DATING OF MULTIMILLION-YEAR-OLD GLACIAL DEPOSITS, AND SURFACE-PROCESS STUDIES USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING LANDFORM EVOLUTION AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS.

THE SCARCITY OF EXPOSED ROCK OUTCROP IN ANTARCTICA, WHICH IS 98% ICE-COVERED, MAKES PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED ROCK SAMPLES VERY VALUABLE TO THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY IN DISCIPLINES LIKE LONG TERM CLIMATE CHANGE, PLANETARY SCIENCE, PALEONTOLOGY, GEOLOGY, MARINE SCIENCE, AND MORE. THE U.S. POLAR ROCK REPOSITORY WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY IN 2003 TO MEET THE NEED FOR PRESERVING ROCK, DREDGE, AND TERRESTRIAL CORE SAMPLES FROM POLAR AREAS. THE POLAR ROCK REPOSITORY SEEKS OUT, ACCEPTS, AND CURATES GEOLOGICAL SAMPLES COLLECTED PRIMARILY FROM ANTARCTICA AND THE SOUTHERN OCEANS. THE EXISTENCE OF THE POLAR ROCK REPOSITORY ALLOWS SAMPLES COLLECTED AT A HIGH FINANCIAL COST TO BE USED TO THEIR FULL SCIENTIFIC POTENTIAL. CURRENTLY MORE THAN 55,000 SAMPLES ARE AVAILABLE AS NO-COST LOANS FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND MUSEUM EXHIBITS. IN ADDITION TO THE PHYSICAL SAMPLES, THE REPOSITORY ARCHIVES SUPPORTING MATERIALS FROM THE COLLECTOR, SUCH AS IMAGES OF THE SAMPLES, FIELD MAPS, AIR PHOTOS, THIN SECTIONS, AND ANY ASSOCIATED BIBLIOGRAPHY/DIGITAL OBJECT IDENTIFIERS. SCIENTISTS, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ROUTINELY USE SAMPLES FROM THE POLAR ROCK REPOSITORY FOR THEIR RESEARCH PROJECTS. THE POLAR ROCK REPOSITORY ALSO FREELY LOANS AN EDUCATIONAL 'ROCK BOX' THAT CONTAINS REPRESENTATIVE ROCK, FOSSIL AND MINERAL SAMPLES, BOOKS AND ACTIVITIES ABOUT GEOLOGY AND ANTARCTICA TO PRE-COLLEGE TEACHERS FROM ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THE POLAR ROCK REPOSITORY RECENTLY DEVELOPED A ?VIRTUAL ROCK BOX? TO ALLOW SIMILAR ACTIVITIES TO OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. THE U.S. POLAR ROCK REPOSITORY (PRR) PROVIDES STEWARDSHIP OF POLAR ROCK SAMPLE COLLECTIONS AND METADATA. IT IS ONE OF THE FEW LENDING ROCK REPOSITORIES TO ALLOW DESTRUCTIVE RESEARCH TECHNIQUES TO BE USED ON SAMPLES. THE PRR WEBSITE AND IN-HOUSE DIGITAL METADATA ARCHIVE PROVIDES FOR GLOBAL DISSEMINATION OF DATA AND A UNIQUE RESOURCE FOR PILOT STUDIES, PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND FIELD LOGISTICS PLANNING. THE PRR PROVIDES FREE, FULL AND OPEN ACCESS TO METADATA AND COLLECTIONS. OVER THE COURSE OF THIS AWARD, THE PRR WILL WORK PROACTIVELY WITH THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO ACQUIRE SCIENTIFICALLY VALUABLE ROCK COLLECTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS THAT WILL ENHANCE THE PRR COLLECTION. SAMPLES WILL BE CATALOGED FOLLOWING STANDARD CURATORIAL PRACTICES AND WILL BE MADE DISCOVERABLE THROUGH THE PUBLIC FACING PORTION OF THE COLLECTIONS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DEVELOPED AT THE BYRD POLAR CLIMATE AND RESEARCH CENTER. THE PRESERVATION OF THESE PHYSICAL SAMPLES, ALONG WITH ARCHIVING OF ASSOCIATED METADATA, AND INCLUSION OF DIGITAL OBJECT IDENTIFIERS IN A DISCOVERABLE ONLINE DATABASE, ALLOWS FOR TRANSPARENCY AND REPRODUCIBILITY IN POLAR EARTH SCIENCE RESEARCH. THE COLLECTIONS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO BE UPDATED AND IMPROVED. THE CURATOR WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE DISCOVERABILITY OF THE PRR BY ATTENDING MEETINGS, CREATING A WEBINAR AND CONTACTING SCIENTISTS ABOUT NEW COLLECTIONS AT THE FACILITY. THE PRR WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL LOANS OF SAMPLES AND ENHANCE THE LINKS WITH OTHER REPOSITORIES AND DATA MANAGEMENT ENTITIES TO BETTER ENABLE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH. EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH TO PRE-COLLEGE SCHOOLS WILL CONTINUE WITH THE 'POLAR ROCK BOX' BEING FREELY AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS WITH IN THE UNITED STATES.

PACK-ICE IS MELTING, WATER IS WARMING, STORMS ARE BECOMING STRONGER AND MORE FREQUENT, AND BASIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS ARE BEING ALTERED. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON THE FATE OF THE PACIFIC WATER THAT ENTERS THE ARCTIC OCEAN THROUGH THE BERING STRAIT, THE NARROW PASSAGE BETWEEN THE US AND RUSSIA. PACIFIC WATER PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE WESTERN ARCTIC ECOSYSTEM. IN WINTERTIME THE COLD INFLOWING WATER PROVIDES NUTRIENTS THAT SPUR THE GROWTH OF PHYTOPLANKTON AT THE BASE OF THE FOOD CHAIN. IN SUMMERTIME, THE WARM WATER MELTS PACK ICE AND PROVIDES FRESH WATER TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN. AFTER THE PACIFIC-ORIGIN WATER CROSSES THE CHUKCHI SEA, NORTH OF BERING STRAIT, SOME OF IT FORMS A CURRENT THAT FLOWS EASTWARD ALONG THE EDGE OF THE ADJACENT BEAUFORT SEA. AS PART OF THE PROJECT, A MOORING WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE CENTER OF THIS CURRENT TO MEASURE ITS PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. THE MOORING HAS BEEN DEPLOYED (WITH A FEW GAPS) SINCE 2002. BY EXTENDING THE MEASUREMENTS FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, THIS PROVIDES THE CHANCE TO DOCUMENT AND UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IMPORTANT PART OF THE ARCTIC SYSTEM IS RESPONDING TO THE DRASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES ? INCLUDING THE VARYING ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND EVOLVING SOURCE WATERS FROM BERING STRAIT. THE DATA OBTAINED BY THE MOORING, ALONG WITH THE SHIPBOARD MEASUREMENTS COLLECTED WHEN THE MOORING IS SERVICED, WILL CONTINUE TO BE WIDELY USED BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN BOTH OBSERVATIONAL AND MODELING STUDIES. A GRADUATE STUDENT WILL BE SUPPORTED BY THE PROJECT, AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH WILL BE UNDERTAKEN DURING ONE OF THE EXPEDITIONS IN ORDER TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC. THE AON MONITORING MOORING IS SITUATED AT 152?W NEAR THE BEAUFORT SEA SHELFBREAK, ROUGHLY 150 KM DOWNSTREAM OF BARROW CANYON ? THE MAIN PACIFIC WATER OUTFLOW POINT FROM THE CHUKCHI SEA. IT WILL BE DEPLOYED FROM FALL 2022 TO FALL 2026, WHICH WILL EXTEND THE TIMESERIES TO 21 YEARS. THE MOORING MEASURES THE VELOCITY OF THE WATER COLUMN, THE THICKNESS AND VELOCITY OF THE PACK ICE, AND THE TEMPERATURE, SALINITY, AND PRESSURE THROUGHOUT THE WATER COLUMN. CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE AND NITRATE ARE MEASURED AT THE TOP OF THE MOORING, AND A PASSIVE ACOUSTIC RECORDER DOCUMENTS MARINE MAMMAL CALLS. ZOOPLANKTON CONCENTRATION IS ESTIMATED USING THE ADCP BACKSCATTER DATA. COLLECTIVELY, THIS INFORMATION ENABLES DETERMINATION OF HOW MUCH WATER, HEAT, NUTRIENTS, CHLOROPHYLL, AND FRESHWATER ARE TRANSPORTED BY THE CURRENT, AND ASSESSMENT OF HOW MUCH EXCHANGE OCCURS BETWEEN THE INTERIOR OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN AND THE BOUNDARY WATERS. THIS INCLUDES WIND-DRIVEN UPWELLING AND DOWNWELLING THAT TAKE PLACE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ALONG THE BEAUFORT SLOPE, AND APPEAR TO BE INCREASING AS THE CLIMATE WARMS. DURING THE BIENNIAL CRUISES TO SERVICE THE MOORING, A HYDROGRAPHIC/VELOCITY SURVEY OF THE BOUNDARY CURRENT SYSTEM IS CARRIED OUT TO OBTAIN A LARGE-SCALE CONTEXT FOR THE MOORING TIMESERIES. THE SHIPBOARD SAMPLING INCLUDES OCCUPATIONS OF SOME OF THE DISTRIBUTED BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY TRANSECTS. AS IN THE PAST, THE BIENNIAL CRUISES WILL PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR A BROAD ARRAY OF INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECTS.

THREE MAIN SOURCES OF NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NPP) HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN THAT DIFFER PRIMARILY IN THEIR TIMING AND LOCATION WITHIN THE WATER COLUMN. THESE INCLUDE (1) SINGLE-CELLED MICROALGAE GROWING WITHIN THE SEA ICE, (2) PHYTOPLANKTON THAT BLOOM IN WATER UNDER THE SEA ICE (UIB), AND (3) PHYTOPLANKTON THAT BLOOM IN OPEN WATER, INCLUDING IN THE MARGINAL ICE ZONE (MIZ) AND AT THE DEPTH OF THE SUBSURFACE CHLOROPHYLL MAXIMUM (SCM). INCREASING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIVE RATES OF NPP AND PARTICLE EXPORT EFFICIENCY FROM THESE THREE SYSTEMS IS CRITICAL IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND HOW CONTINUED SEA ICE LOSS, AND THE ASSOCIATED SHIFTS IN ICE ALGAL AND PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOM DYNAMICS, WILL DIFFERENTIALLY IMPACT BENTHIC AND PELAGIC FOOD WEBS IN SHALLOW SEAS THROUGHOUT THE ARCTIC OCEAN, INCLUDING MANY ORGANISMS ON WHICH INDIGENOUS HUMAN POPULATIONS RELY. THE PARTICLE FLUX ASPECTS OF THIS PROPOSAL COULD BE TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE. WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE RELATIVE CARBON FLUXES FROM SEA ICE, UIBS, AND OPEN WATER PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS AND VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT THE PROCESSES THAT CONTROL THOSE FLUXES.

FURTHERMORE, THE PROJECT BROADENS THE PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN STANFORD UNIVERSITY?S SUMMER UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH IN GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (SURGE) PROGRAM. THE ARRIGO LAB ALSO TAKES PART IN STANFORD?S SCHOOL OF EARTH SCIENCES HIGH SCHOOL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. RESULTS OF THIS WORK WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO LECTURE AND LABORATORY CLASSES AT STANFORD EXPLORING THE EFFECT OF UIBS ON THE BIOLOGY AND BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN. FINALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF TWO PH.D. STUDENTS (ONE FEMALE AFRICAN AMERICAN) AND ONE POST-DOC. TRAINING OF UNDERGRADUATES WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS PROJECT, AND WE EXPECT 4-6 TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS CRUISE. PART 2 DETAILED OBSERVATIONS OF MICROALGAL BLOOMS IN THE CHUKCHI SEA HAVE BEEN LARGELY MADE AT A TIME OF YEAR WHEN MOST OF THE CHUKCHI SHELF IS ALREADY IN OPEN WATER. AS SUCH, THE RELATIVE RATES OF DAILY NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION (NPP) BY SEA ICE MICROALGAE, UNDER-ICE PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS (UIBS), AND OPEN WATER PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS ARE NOT WELL KNOWN. ADDITIONALLY, THE FATE OF THE ORGANIC MATTER ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THREE NPP SOURCES IS POORLY KNOWN. HENCE, THERE IS A STRONG NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE MEASUREMENTS BEGINNING IN LATE SPRING THAT CAPTURE ALL THREE BLOOMS, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON PARTICLE EXPORT EVENTS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSED STUDY ARE TO UTILIZE DATA OBTAINED FROM A SHIP-BASED FIELD PROGRAM TO THE CHUKCHI SEA TO 1) MEASURE RATES OF NPP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEA ICE, UIBS, AND OPEN WATER PHYTOPLANKTON IN BOTH THE MIZ AND SCM, 2) USE SEDIMENT TRAPS TO CHARACTERIZE AND QUANTIFY THE VERTICAL SINKING FLUXES OF BULK PARTICULATE MATTER FROM THE SEA ICE, UIBS, AND OPEN WATER PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS, AND 3) USE OUR NEWLY DEVELOPED HYDRODYNAMIC TREADMILL TO DETERMINE HOW SINKING SPEEDS OF MICROALGAE FROM ALL THREE NPP SOURCES VARY BY COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION. THE CENTERPIECE OF OUR PROPOSED PROGRAM IS A 45-DAY PROCESS STUDY CRUISE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE IN JUNE 2023. THE CRUISE WILL CONSIST OF A SERIES OF HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS/SECTIONS THAT WILL REPEATEDLY TRANSITION BETWEEN THE DEEP ICE PACK AND THE MARGINAL ICE ZONE. 150 HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY (HS) STATIONS WILL INCLUDE VERTICAL PROFILES OF TEMPERATURE, SALINITY, CURRENTS, LIGHT, NUTRIENTS, AND CHL A CONCENTRATION. AT 90 OF THESE (REFERRED TO AS BIOLOGICAL SAMPLING (BS) STATIONS), WE WILL ALSO COLLECT SAMPLES TO MEASURE ALGAL AND ZOOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE/SPECIES/SIZE (THE LATTER USING THE UNDERWATER VISION PROFILER, UVP), ALGAL PHYSIOLOGY, NPP, POC, PARTICLE SINKING SPEEDS (HYDRODYNAMIC TREADMILL), DEPLOY A HAPS CORER TO MEASURE SEDIMENT CHL A, AND DEPLOY SEDIMENT TRAPS TO MEASURE VERTICAL FLUXES OF ICE ALGAE, PHYTOPLANKTON, DETRITUS, AND FECAL PELLETS (AT 1/3 OF THE BS STATIONS). DURING TRANSITS, WE WILL CONTINUOUSLY MEASURE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE, SALINITY, AND CHL A FLUORESCENCE FROM THE VARIOUS SHIP?S SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE DETAILED MAPS OF THESE PARAMETERS ABOVE AND BELOW THE ICE. ABOUT EVERY SECOND DAY, WE WILL CONDUCT A 6-HOUR SEA ICE (SI) STATION NEAR SOLAR NOON WHERE WE WILL MEASURE THE PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES (SEE ABOVE) OF THE ICE PACK AND UNDERLYING SURFACE WATER, AS WELL AS DEPLOY SEDIMENT TRAPS TO MEASURE SINKING FLUXES OF ALGAE, DETRITUS, AND FECAL PELLETS FROM THE SEA ICE AND FROM THE UIB. THE SHIP WILL ALSO BE USED AS A PLATFORM FOR CHARACTERIZING BUOYANCY REGULATION AND MEASURING SINKING SPEEDS OF MICROALGAL CELLS AND AGGREGATES UNDER VARIOUS MANIPULATED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS USING THE HYDRODYNAMIC TREADMILL. THIS INSTRUMENT PROVIDES UNLIMITED SCOPE FOR ACTIVE VERTICAL TRACKING OF PARTICLES (SCALE-FREE), WHILE CONCURRENTLY PROVIDING MICRON AND MILLISECOND-SCALE SPATIOTEMPORAL RESOLUTION. THE HYDRODYNAMIC TREADMILL ALSO DIRECTLY MEASURES THE FLOW FIELD AROUND THE DIATOM TO MEASURE ANY BOUND MATRIX MATERIALS (NOT VISIBLE OPTICALLY) ASSOCIATED WITH A SINGLE CELL AND CAN PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF PARTICLE POROSITY AND DENSITY. AT EACH BS AND SI STATION, MEASUREMENTS OF SINKING SPEED WILL BE COMBINED WITH DETAILED ANALYSES OF ALGAL TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION, PHYSIOLOGY, AND SIZE STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., LIGHT, TEMPERATURE, NUTRIENTS) TO DETERMINE FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND ASSESS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EACH OF THE THREE PRIMARY BLOOM COMMUNITIES TO SINKING PARTICLE FLUXES.

UNDERGROUND FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION ARE CRITICAL TO SUBSISTENCE AND FOOD SECURITY FOR MANY ALASKA NATIVE HOUSEHOLDS. HOWEVER, PERMAFROST THAW AND SUBSIDENCE ARE CAUSING MANY CACHES TO COLLAPSE OR FLOOD. EMPLOYING COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH, THE PI TEAM WILL DOCUMENT CURRENT AND PAST USE OF FOOD CACHES ETHNOGRAPHICALLY AND IDENTIFY EMERGING FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION CHALLENGES. THE CONDITION AND INTEGRITY OF EXISTING CACHES WILL BE ASSESSED USING ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE METHODS. THIS MIXED-METHODS PROJECT EMPLOYS BOTH ETHNOGRAPHIC METHODS AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. MEMBERS OF THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL CONDUCT PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION AND ORAL HISTORY INTERVIEWS IN THREE ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGES WITH TRADITIONS OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE. WITH COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE, CACHES WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED. THE CONDITION OF SELECT CACHES WILL BE MONITORED TO DETECT SUBSIDENCE AND TO MEASURE TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, AND RATE OF PERMAFROST THAW. BIO- AND GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES WILL ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO CHARACTERIZE PERMAFROST COMPOSITION AND HYDROLOGY.

THIS STUDY USES MODERN -OMICS APPROACHES TO EVALUATE THE BIODIVERSITY, EVOLUTION, AND ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC MARINE NEMATODES AND THEIR HOST-ASSOCIATED MICROBIOMES FROM A VARIETY OF HABITATS COLLECTED AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS. THE RESULTS ARE PRODUCING AN IMPORTANT BASELINE DATASET OF ANTARCTIC MEIOFAUNAL DIVERSITY. ALL GENOMIC RESOURCES GENERATED IN THIS PROJECT WILL BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AS OPEN-SOURCE DATASETS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR LONG-TERM SCIENTIFIC REUSE. THIS PROJECT SUPPORTS DIVERSE RESEARCHERS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS AND PRODUCES A SUITE OF ANTARCTIC-FOCUSED DIGITAL PUBLIC OUTREACH PRODUCTS. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: NEMATODE WORMS ARE ABUNDANT AND UBIQUITOUS IN MARINE SEDIMENT HABITATS WORLDWIDE, PERFORMING KEY FUNCTIONS SUCH AS NUTRIENT CYCLING AND SEDIMENT STABILITY. HOWEVER, STUDY OF THIS PHYLUM SUFFERS FROM A PERPETUAL AND SEVERE TAXONOMIC DEFICIT, WITH LESS THAN 5,000 FORMALLY DESCRIBED MARINE SPECIES. FAUNA FROM THE SOUTHERN OCEAN ARE ESPECIALLY POORLY STUDIED DUE TO LIMITED SAMPLING AND THE GENERAL INACCESSIBILITY OF THE ANTARCTIC BENTHOS. THIS STUDY IS PROVIDING THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE MOLECULAR-BASED INVESTIGATION FROM MARINE NEMATODES IN THE EASTERN ANTARCTIC CONTINENTAL SHELF, PROVIDING AN IMPORTANT COMPARATIVE DATASET FOR THE EXISTING BODY OF HISTORICAL (MORPHOLOGICAL) TAXONOMIC STUDIES. THIS PROJECT USES A COMBINATION OF CLASSICAL TAXONOMY (MICROSCOPY) AND MODERN -OMICS TOOLS TO ACHIEVE THREE OVERARCHING AIMS: 1) DETERMINE IF MOLECULAR DATA SUPPORTS HIGH BIODIVERSITY AND ENDEMISM OF BENTHIC MEIOFAUNA IN ANTARCTIC BENTHIC ECOSYSTEMS; 2) DETERMINE THE PROPORTION OF MARINE NEMATODE SPECIES THAT HAVE A DEEP-SEA VERSUS SHALLOW-WATER EVOLUTIONARY ORIGIN ON THE ANTARCTIC SHELF, AND ASSESS PATTERNS OF CRYPTIC SPECIATION IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN; AND 3) DETERMINE THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF THE HOST-ASSOCIATED MICROBIOME IN ANTARCTIC MARINE NEMATODES. THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO RAPIDLY ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF ANTARCTIC MEIOFAUNA, PROVIDE INSIGHT ON POPULATION-LEVEL PATTERNS WITHIN KEY INDICATOR GENERA, AND ELUCIDATE THE POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WHICH MAY INFLUENCE MICROBIOME PATTERNS. BROADER IMPACTS ACTIVITIES INCLUDE AN INTENSIVE CRUISE- AND LAND-BASED OUTREACH PROGRAM FOCUSING ON SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT AND DIGITAL OUTREACH PRODUCTS, RAISING AWARENESS OF ANTARCTIC MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND UNDERSTUDIED MICROBIAL-ANIMAL RELATIONSHIPS.

SPECIFICALLY, THE FLOW OF GLACIAL ICE AT DEPTH IN THE MARGINS OF FAST-FLOWING ICE, WHERE THE ICE IS NEAR ITS PRESSURE MELTING POINT, DEPENDS ON THE FRACTION OF LIQUID WATER STORED IN THE NETWORK OF VEINS AT ICE-GRAIN BOUNDARIES. IT IS THEREFORE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THE PERMEABILITY OF THESE SYSTEMS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CONTROLS ON ICE PERMEABILITY THROUGH TESTS ON LABORATORY ICE AND GLACIER ICE. EXPERIMENTS WITH LABORATORY ICE WILL INFORM ON HOW GRAIN SIZE AND WATER CONTENT AFFECT PERMEABILITY, WHILE EXPERIMENTS WITH GLACIER ICE WILL EXAMINE HOW DEFORMATION OF THE ICE AFFECTS PERMEABILITY. RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PERMEABILITY OF ICE NEAR ITS PRESSURE MELTING POINT AS A FUNCTION OF GRAIN SIZE, WATER CONTENT, AND DEFORMATION. THE EXPERIMENTS ARE NOT INTENDED TO SIMULATE INTERSTITIAL WATER FLOW IN A GLACIER. THIS PROJECT INCLUDES GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE PARTICIPATION AND SEEKS TO INCLUDE A PARTICIPANT FROM THE POLARTREC PROGRAM TO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN K-12 CLASSROOMS. THIS PROJECT WILL MEASURE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PERMEABILITY OF TEMPERATE ICE AS A FUNCTION OF ITS GRAIN SIZE, WATER CONTENT, AND FOLIATION. THE TEAM WILL USE A FALLING-HEAD PERMEAMETER DESIGNED AND TESTED FOR THIS APPLICATION. A DISK OF ICE, 140 MM IN DIAMETER AND UP TO 70 MM THICK, IS KEPT UNDER PRESSURE AND AT THE PRESSURE-MELTING TEMPERATURE WHILE CHILLED WATER TRANSIENTLY FLOWS THROUGH THE DISK UNDER A HEAD THAT IS ALLOWED TO DECREASE WITH TIME. THE RATE OF HEAD DECREASE PROVIDES THE PERMEABILITY VALUE. DIFFERENT WATER CONTENTS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY VARYING THE SALINITY OF THE ICE AND WILL BE MEASURED WITH A CALORIMETRIC METHOD USED SUCCESSFULLY IN PRIOR ICE-DEFORMATION EXPERIMENTS. CHILLED WATER INTRODUCED TO ICE DISKS WILL CONTAIN FLUORESCEIN DYE TO ALLOW FLOW NETWORKS TO BE STUDIED IN THIN-SECTIONS AFTER EXPERIMENTS. EXPERIMENTS WITH GLACIER ICE, COLLECTED FROM SHALLOW CORES AT ATHABASCA GLACIER, ALBERTA, WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ICE FOLIATION STYLE AND ORIENTATION ON PERMEABILITY. THESE MEASUREMENTS MAY ALSO POINT TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PERMEABILITY OF LAB-MADE AND GLACIER ICE THAT ARE UNRELATED TO STRUCTURAL ANISOTROPY. RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST TEST OF PERMEABILITY MODELS BASED ON POISEUILLE FLOW OF WATER THOUGH IDEALIZED VEIN NETWORKS. THESE UNTESTED MODELS ARE THE PRIMARY BASIS FOR ESTIMATING ICE PERMEABILITY IN GLACIER FLOW MODELS. NEW EMPIRICALLY-GROUNDED PERMEABILITY MODELS RESULTING FROM THIS PROJECT WILL ALLOW THE WATER CONTENT OF TEMPERATE PORTIONS OF ICE-STREAM SHEAR MARGINS TO BE ESTIMATED, THEREBY IMPROVING MODELS OF ICE SOFTENING BY WATER AND ASSOCIATED ICE-FLOW KINEMATICS IN SHEAR MARGINS.

WHILE WARMING MAY LEAD TO INCREASED GROWTH IN FORESTS LIMITED BY SHORT, COLD GROWING SEASONS, CLIMATE CHANGE COULD ALSO LEAD TO SURPRISES. ONE EXAMPLE IS A DECOUPLING BETWEEN TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY AND ANNUAL GROWTH RATES IN BOREAL FOREST TREES THAT HAS BEEN DETECTED OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES. THIS ?DIVERGENCE PROBLEM? SUGGESTS THAT TREE GROWTH IN SOME ARCTIC FOREST SYSTEMS IS NO LONGER LIMITED BY TEMPERATURE. THE CAUSES ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD AND CAN BE HARD TO TEST DUE TO OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING GROWTH, SUCH AS DROUGHT DUE TO THE WARMING CLIMATE. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST FOR DIVERGENCE ACROSS THE TREELINE FORESTS OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA, ESPECIALLY IN RAPIDLY WARMING REGIONS OF ALASKA AND NORTHWESTERN CANADA. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL USE TREE-RING RECORDS OBTAINED FROM THE WOOD OF ANCIENT TREES, A COMBINATION OF MATHEMATICAL METHODS AND MODELING, AND WOOD ANATOMY ANALYSIS, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND FOREST GROWTH PATTERNS RELATED TO DIVERGENCE. BROADER IMPACTS: NEW MEASUREMENTS ARE CRITICAL IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND HOW BOREAL FORESTS INTERACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERE AND FEEDBACK WITH OTHER FEATURES OF THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THIS UNDERSTANDING BY ESTIMATING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CLIMATE AND FOREST GROWTH USING TREE RINGS AT SITES SPANNING MANY NORTHERN LOCATIONS. THE PROJECT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR STUDENTS, NATIVE AMERICAN CITIZENS, AND FOR TEACHERS TO TAKE PART IN ARCTIC RESEARCH. THE RAPID WARMING OF THE ARCTIC IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT PROFOUNDLY NORTHERN FOREST SYSTEMS. WHILE WARMING MAY LEAD TO GREATER PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH IN FORESTS TYPICALLY LIMITED BY SHORT, COLD GROWING SEASONS, THE SPEED AND MAGNITUDE OF CLIMATE CHANGE COULD ALSO LEAD TO SURPRISES. ONE EXAMPLE IS A DECOUPLING BETWEEN TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY AND ANNUAL GROWTH RATES IN BOREAL FOREST TREES THAT HAS BEEN DETECTED AT FOREST SITES SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THIS PHENOMENON, KNOWN AS THE ?DIVERGENCE PROBLEM?, SUGGESTS THAT TREE GROWTH IN SOME ARCTIC FOREST SYSTEMS IS NO LONGER PRIMARILY LIMITED BY TEMPERATURE. THE CAUSES ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD AND HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO TEST DUE TO THE CO-VARYING BIOLOGICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS POTENTIALLY IMPACTING RECENT TREE GROWTH. ONE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT ONCE WARMING HAS SURPASSED A PHYSIOLOGICAL THRESHOLD, DROUGHT STRESS LIMITS GROWTH. ANOTHER HYPOTHESIS IS ?GLOBAL DIMMING?, IN WHICH INCREASED ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR RADIATION AVAILABLE FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THIS PROJECT WILL ASSESS CURRENT DIVERGENCE HYPOTHESES ACROSS THE TREELINE FORESTS OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA, EMPHASIZING RAPIDLY WARMING REGIONS OF ALASKA AND NORTHWESTERN CANADA, WHICH APPEAR TO BE KEY AREAS FOR DIVERGENCE-TYPE EFFECTS. THE PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE A NEW, LARGE COMPILATION OF TREE-RING DATA (ALREADY IN HAND) AND UPDATE KEY LOCATIONS THAT HAVE SHOWN EARLY EVIDENCE OF UNUSUAL GROWTH DECLINE DESPITE RECENT WARMING. DETECTION OF RECENT CHANGES IN GROWTH PARAMETERS WILL USE A NOVEL, INTEGRATED COMBINATION OF STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES, QUANTITATIVE WOOD ANATOMY METHODS, AND TREE GROWTH MODELING TO DEVELOP A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE EXTENT, CAUSES, AND CARBON CYCLE IMPLICATIONS OF DIVERGENCE. BROADER IMPACTS: NEW MEASUREMENTS OF BOREAL FOREST DYNAMICS ARE CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW BOREAL SYSTEMS INTERACT WITH THE CHANGING ATMOSPHERE AND THE FEEDBACKS BETWEEN COUPLED EARTH SYSTEM DOMAINS. THIS PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THIS UNDERSTANDING BY DEVELOPING QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATES OF CLIMATE/GROWTH INTERACTIONS AT DAILY TO CENTENNIAL TIME SCALES AND SPATIAL SCALES FROM CELLULAR TO CONTINENTAL, YIELDING VALUABLE, NOVEL DATA FOR MODELING OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND PRODUCTIVITY IN NORTHERN FORESTS.

PACHYDERMA AS A CLIMATE ARCHIVE: NEW APPROACHES TO DEDUCE 'NEAR SURFACE' TEMPERATURES -PART 1: POLAR REGIONS ARE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO RISING TEMPERATURES AND INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF ATMOSPHERIC GREENHOUSE GASES. CURRENTLY, THE OBSERVED WARMING IN THE ARCTIC IS ALMOST TWICE THAT OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AS A WHOLE. A MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT FURTHER WARMING OF THIS REGION COULD POTENTIALLY WEAKEN THE NORTH ATLANTIC CIRCULATION, WHICH WILL HAVE A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON CLIMATE IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA. IN ORDER TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL THE RATE AND MAGNITUDE OF FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE, WE NEED TO ACQUIRE ROBUST DATA FROM PAST CLIMATE EVENTS FROM THIS REGION THAT CAN BE COMPARED TO CURRENT OBSERVATIONS AND HELP WITH FUTURE PREDICTIONS. MUCH OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTH?S PAST CLIMATE IS DEDUCED FROM CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF FOSSIL FORAMINIFERA SHELLS RECOVERED FROM DRILL CORES. FORAMINIFERA, WHICH ARE UBIQUITOUS IN THE WORLD?S OCEANS, ARE SMALL ORGANISMS THAT FORM A SAND-GRAIN-SIZED CALCIUM CARBONATE (CALCITE) SHELL. AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE CYCLE, THE EMPTY SHELL IS DEPOSITED ON THE SEAFLOOR WHERE IT CAN BE PRESERVED FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS. WHILE THE APPROACH TO RECONSTRUCT PAST CLIMATE EVENTS FROM FOSSIL FORAMINIFERA SHELLS, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN THE 1950S AND CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED OVER MANY DECADES, WORKS WELL IN LOW- AND MID-LATITUDE OCEANS, DEDUCING ACCURATE PAST TEMPERATURES FROM FORAMINIFERA SHELLS FROM THE POLAR NORTH ATLANTIC REMAINS CHALLENGING. PILOT DATA FROM FOSSIL FORAMINIFERA SHELLS (SPECIES NEOGLOBOQUADRINA PACHYDERMA) FROM THE POLAR NORTH ATLANTIC ACQUIRED FOR THIS STUDY REVEAL THAT THE SO-CALLED ?LAMELLAR CALCITE?, WHICH IS THE EARLY GENERATION OF SHELL CALCITE THAT FORMS IN THE UPPER WATER COLUMN AND PROVIDES A ?NEAR-SURFACE? SIGNAL, IS OFTEN PARTIALLY OR LARGELY DISSOLVED. THUS, THE REMAINING SHELL COMPRISES MOSTLY THE LATER-FORMED OUTER ?CRUST CALCITE?, WHICH RECORDS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FROM MUCH GREATER (TYPICALLY COLDER) WATER DEPTHS. AS AFFECTED SHELLS LOOK UNSUSPICIOUS ? THE LOSS OF THE LAMELLAR CALCITE IS NOT VISIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE WHEN INSPECTED BY MICROSCOPE ? SHELLS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR LAMELLAR CALCITE HAVE LIKELY BEEN SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS IN MANY PRIOR STUDIES. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIONS FROM SHELLS WITH DISSOLVED LAMELLAR CALCITE ARE BIASED TOWARDS COLDER TEMPERATURES. FORTUNATELY, SHELLS WITH WELL-PRESERVED LAMELLAR CALCITE ARE TYPICALLY CO-OCCURRING WITH THOSE FEATURING POOR PRESERVATION IN THE SAME CORE SAMPLES AND CAN THUS BE SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO CAREFULLY SELECT SHELLS WITH INTACT LAMELLAR CALCITE (PRESERVED NEAR-SURFACE SIGNAL), AND THE RATIO OF MAGNESIUM/CALCIUM OF THE LAMELLAR CALCITE AS A CHEMICAL RECORDER OF PAST TEMPERATURES WILL BE MEASURED. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION FROM CONVENTIONAL ANALYTICAL APPROACHES THAT AVERAGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE WHOLE SHELL WITH AN UNKNOWN PROPORTION OF LAMELLAR CALCITE (WARM NEAR-SURFACE SIGNAL) AND CRUST CALCITE (COLD DEEP-WATER SIGNAL). THE ANALYTICAL APPROACH, WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS STUDY, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE VERACITY OF PALEORECORDS FROM THE POLAR NORTH ATLANTIC, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO GAUGE THE RESPONSE OF THIS SENSITIVE REGION TO FUTURE GREENHOUSE GAS FORCING. PART 2: CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE POLAR NORTH ATLANTIC OCCURS AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN MOST OTHER AREAS OF THE WORLD?S OCEANS. THEREFORE, ACCURATE RECORDS OF PAST CLIMATE VARIABILITY FROM THIS AREA ARE ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVE FORECASTS OF HOW THIS SENSITIVE REGION WILL REACT IN FUTURE SCENARIOS WITH ENHANCED GREENHOUSE GAS FORCING. HOWEVER, EVEN AFTER DECADES OF RESEARCH, PALEOCLIMATE RECORDS FROM THE POLAR NORTH ATLANTIC LEAVE MANY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED AND OFTEN DO NOT ALIGN WITH RESULTS FROM MODEL SIMULATIONS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECORDS, REFLECTING PAST CLIMATE VARIABILITY, ARE DERIVED FROM FOSSIL SHELLS OF PLANKTIC FORAMINIFERA; MINUTE, SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS WHICH ARE UBIQUITOUS IN THE WORLD?S OCEANS. A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF FORAMINIFERA IS THEIR SAND-GRAIN-SIZED CALCIUM CARBONATE (CALCITE) SHELL WHICH IS EVENTUALLY DEPOSITED ON THE SEAFLOOR WHERE IT CAN BE PRESERVED FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS. FOSSIL SHELLS CAN BE RECOVERED FROM DRILL CORES, AND SUBSEQUENT ANALYSES OF THEIR CHEMICAL OR ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION ALLOWS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE WATER TEMPERATURE (AND OTHER PARAMETERS) THAT PERSISTED WHILE THE SHELLS WERE FORMED. THIS APPROACH TO RECONSTRUCT PALEOTEMPERATURES WORKS VERY WELL OUTSIDE THE POLAR REGIONS. ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS WHETHER CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FORAMINIFERA SPECIES NEOGLOBOQUADRINA PACHYDERMA, WHICH IS THE ONLY ABUNDANT FORAMINIFERA IN HIGH LATITUDE SEDIMENTS, CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHALLENGES TO DEDUCE ROBUST PALEORECORDS FROM THE POLAR NORTH ATLANTIC. PILOT DATA ACQUIRED FOR THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE SO-CALLED INNER ?LAMELLAR CALCITE? OF FOSSIL N. PACHYDERMA SHELLS, WHICH IS THE EARLY GENERATION OF CALCITE THAT FORMS IN THE UPPER WATER COLUMN (TYPICALLY WARMER TEMPERATURES), IS OFTEN LARGELY DISSOLVED, WHEREAS THE OUTER ?CRUST CALCITE?, WHICH FORMS IN MUCH DEEPER WATERS AND THUS TYPICALLY REFLECTS COLDER TEMPERATURES, IS STILL WELL PRESERVED. INTERESTINGLY, THIS LOSS OF THE LAMELLAR CALCITE IS NOT VISIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE WHEN THE SHELLS ARE INSPECTED BY MICROSCOPE. THUS, IT IS LIKELY THAT SHELLS WITH DISSOLVED LAMELLAR CALCITE WERE SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS IN MANY PRIOR STUDIES, WHICH MAY HAVE BIASED THE CALCULATED TEMPERATURES TOWARDS THE COOLER, DEEPER WATERS WHERE THE REMAINING OUTER CRUST WAS FORMED. FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE FOUND THAT SHELLS WITH WELL-PRESERVED LAMELLAR CALCITE ARE TYPICALLY CO-OCCURRING WITH THOSE FEATURING POOR PRESERVATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP NEW SCREENING METHODS TO CAREFULLY SELECT N. PACHYDERMA SHELLS FEATURING WELL-PRESERVED LAMELLAR CALCITE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE LAMELLAR CALCITE, WHICH HAS FORMED NEAR THE SEA SURFACE, WILL BE ANALYZED BY LASER-ABLATION FOR ITS MAGNESIUM/CALCIUM (MG/CA) RATIO, WHICH CAN BE CONVERTED TO THE WATER TEMPERATURES THAT PERSISTED IN THE PAST WHEN THE FORAMINIFERA FORMED THEIR SHELLS. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION FROM CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES THAT USE THE ENTIRE SHELL, WHEREBY THE INFORMATION RECORDED IN THE LAMELLAR CALCITE (NEAR-SURFACE SIGNAL) IS MIXED WITH THE COMPOSITION OF THE CRUST CALCITE (DEEP WATER SIGNAL). THUS, CONVENTIONAL ANALYTICAL APPROACHES MAY NOT CAPTURE THE ENTIRE TEMPERATURE VARIATION AT OR NEAR THE SEA SURFACE. THE ANALYTICAL APPROACH, WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS STUDY, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE VERACITY OF PALEORECORDS FROM THE POLAR NORTH ATLANTIC, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO GAUGE THE RESPONSE OF THIS SENSITIVE REGION TO FUTURE GREENHOUSE GAS FORCING. THIS NEW TECHNIQUE WILL FURTHER BE TESTED ON TWO SEDIMENT CORES FROM THE POLAR NORTH ATLANTIC, SPANNING THE PAST ~26,000 YEARS FROM THE COLDEST TEMPERATURES OF THE LAST ICE AGE TO THE MODERN, MUCH WARMER CLIMATE.

THE PROJECT BROADER IMPACTS INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR A POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER, THREE GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS. IN ADDITION, THE PROJECT WILL SUPPORT PRODUCTION OF AN OUTREACH FILM BASED ON THE PROPOSED RESEARCH EXPEDITION. THE PROJECT ALSO WILL FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UPPER-LEVEL UNDERGRADUATE COURSE FOCUSED ON THE DEGLACIATION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL, AN OCEANOGRAPHIC EXPEDITION WILL STUDY FOUR WEST GREENLAND TROUGH MOUTH FAN SYSTEMS (WHERE THE GIS DEPOSITED LARGE VOLUMES OF SEDIMENT WHEN IT EXTENDED OFFSHORE) USING SEAFLOOR AND SUB-SEAFLOOR IMAGING TECHNIQUES AND BY COLLECTING SEDIMENT CORES SPANNING THE END OF THE LAST ICE AGE TO PRESENT. BIOLOGICAL, MAGNETIC, GEOCHEMICAL, AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES FROM THE SEDIMENT RECORDS WILL BE USED TO TEST THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS; THAT INCREASING OCEAN TEMPERATURE AT THE BASE OF MARINE TERMINATING GLACIERS IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF ICE-SHEET INSTABILITY. THE PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH: 1) THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF WARM ATLANTIC WATER INCURSION ALONG THE WEST GREENLAND MARGIN; 2) THE PHASING OF ICE MARGIN RETREAT AND OCEAN CHANGE; AND 3) THE INFLUENCE OF REGIONAL GEOLOGY, GEOMORPHOLOGY, AND ICE DYNAMICS ON ICE-MARGIN RETREAT. EARLY CAREER LEADERSHIP (SUPPORTED BY SENIOR MENTORS) IS AT THE HEART OF THIS PROJECT WITH THREE US-BASED ASSISTANT PROFESSORS AND ONE POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHER DIRECTING SHIPBOARD OPERATIONS AND SPEARHEADING THE POST-EXPEDITION SCIENCE. HALF OF THE SEA-GOING SCIENCE PARTY WILL BE GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. ACQUISITION OF THE FIRST US-BASED SEDIMENT CORES FROM BAFFIN BAY AND ARCHIVAL OF THE CORES AND DATA IN US FACILITIES AND DATABASES WILL PROVIDE DIVERSE HIGH-LATITUDE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES TO THE NSF COMMUNITY, ENSURING THE CONTINUING LEGACY OF THIS PROJECT.

IMPACT ON ANTARCTIC BROMOCARBON BUDGETS AND PROCESSES -THE OZONE HOLE THAT DEVELOPS OVER THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT EVERY SPRING IS ONE OF THE FEATURES ATTRIBUTED TO HUMAN ACTIVITY, IN PARTICULAR PRODUCTION OF THE CFC (CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS IN REFRIGERANTS) RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. IN SPITE OF THE CFC BAN FROM THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED IN THE YEAR 1987, THE RECOVERY HAS BEEN SLOWER THAN PREDICTED. BROMOCARBONS, KNOWN TO PRODUCE THE STRATOSPHERIC OZONE DEPLETION, HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ESTIMATED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE POOL OF BROMINES IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE. WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE BROMOCARBONS IN ANTARCTIC SEA ICE? IS THIS AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF CHEMICALS CREATING THE OZONE HOLE? THIS PROJECT WILL TEST IF BROMOCARBONS IN SEA ICE ARE PRODUCED AND DEGRADED BY MICROALGAE AND BACTERIA FOUND IN SEA ICE, IN SNOW AND THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE TWO. THE PROJECT WILL COLLECT A SUITE OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF SEA ICE AND SNOW TO DETERMINE BROMOCARBON CONCENTRATIONS, MICROBIAL ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, AND INTRA-CELLULAR GENES AND PROTEINS INVOLVED IN BROMOCARBON METABOLISM. THIS PROJECT BENEFITS NSF?S GOALS OF EXPANDING FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE OF ANTARCTIC SYSTEMS, BIOTA, AND PROCESSES, AND IMPROVING THE UNDERSTANDING OF INTERACTIONS AMONG THE ANTARCTIC SYSTEMS, CRYOSPHERE AND ORGANISMS. THE WORK WILL BE CARRIED OUT AT MCMURDO STATION IN LATE AUSTRAL SPRING, INCLUDING SAMPLING OF SNOW AND ICE THAT WILL BE CONCENTRATED IN THE LABORATORY, AND 24-HOUR EXPERIMENTS TO MEASURE ALGAL AND BACTERIAL ACTIVITY. GENES CONTROLLING SYNTHESIS OF ENZYMES INVOLVED IN BROMOCARBON METABOLISM ARE OF INTEREST IN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOREMEDIATION, INCLUDING PRODUCTS THAT REPAIR DAMAGED SKIN FROM ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION. THE PROJECT WILL TRAIN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ON CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PACIFIC SCIENCE CENTER IN SEATTLE WITH ~10,000 VISITORS PER WEEKEND WHERE THEY WILL DEVELOP A PROJECT-SPECIFIC EXHIBIT. THE MICROBIAL PROCESSES IN SNOW AND ICE ASSOCIATED WITH BROMOCARBON SYNTHESIS AND DEGRADATION HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED IN ANTARCTICA DURING WINTER AND SPRING. THIS STUDY WILL INFORM ABOUT MICROBIAL ACTIVITY IN RELATION TO THE RELEASE OF BROMOCARBONS COMPOUNDS FROM THE SNOW AND ICE SURFACES, COMPOUNDS KNOWN TO DEGRADE STRATOSPHERIC OZONE. THE ESTIMATION OF CHEMICAL BROMOCARBONS WILL BE COMBINED WITH METAGENOMICS AND METAPROTEOMICS APPROACHES FOR UNDERSTANDING THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF MICROBES IN SNOW AND SEA ICE. THE ENVIRONMENTAL, CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DATA WILL BE SYNTHESIZED WITH MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS AND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SITES AND EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS WITH ANOVA. A COLLABORATOR FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF GOTEBORG IN SWEDEN WILL COLLABORATE ON BROMOCARBON ANALYSES. THE STUDY WILL ALSO ADDRESS ?SALINE SNOW? A NEW ENVIRONMENT NOT PREVIOUSLY STUDIED FOR MICROBIAL LIFE. IN ADDITION, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY OF META-PROTEOMICS IN SNOW AND ICE. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS EXPECT THEIR RESULTS WILL HELP INFORM OZONE HOLE RECOVERY IN THE 21ST CENTURY.

THIS 4-YEAR PROJECT IS EVALUATING EVIDENCE OF EXTINCTION PATTERNS AND DEPOSITIONAL CONDITIONS FROM A HIGH SOUTHERN LATITUDE CRETACEOUS-PALEOGENE (K-PG) OUTCROP SECTION FOUND ON SEYMORE ISLAND, IN THE WESTERN ANTARCTIC PENINSULA. THE TEAM IS USING SEDIMENT SAMPLES COLLECTED BELOW THE WEATHERING HORIZON TO EVALUATE DETAILED SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES, GEOCHEMISTRY, AND MICROFOSSILS IN TARGETED STRATIGRAPHIC INTERVALS. THE STUDY WILL HELP DETERMINE IF THE K-PG MASS EXTINCTION WAS A SINGLE OR DOUBLE PHASED EVENT AND WHETHER SEYMOUR ISLAND REGION IN THE GEOLOGICAL PAST WAS A RESTRICTED, SUBOXIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT OR AN OPEN WELL-MIXED SHELF. THE AWARD INCLUDES AN INTEGRATED PLAN FOR STUDENT TRAINING AT ALL LEVELS, ENHANCED BY A HIGHLIGHTED PARTNERSHIP WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EARTH SCIENCES TEACHER WORKING IN A SCHOOL SERVING UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS APPLYING MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS AN OVERARCHING RESEARCH QUESTION FOR WHICH RECENT STUDIES ARE IN DISAGREEMENT: IS THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE FROM A UNIQUE OUTCROPPING ON SEYMOUR ISLAND, ANTARCTICA CONSISTENT WITH A SINGLE OR DOUBLE PHASED EXTINCTION? IN A TWO-PHASED MODEL, THE FIRST EXTINCTION WOULD AFFECT PRIMARILY BENTHIC ORGANISMS AND WOULD HAVE OCCURRED ~150 KILOYEARS PRIOR TO A SEPARATE EXTINCTION AT THE K-PG BOUNDARY. HOWEVER, THIS EARLY EXTINCTION COULD PLAUSIBLY BE EXPLAINED BY AN UNRECOGNIZED FACIES CONTROL THAT IS OBSCURED BY SURFICIAL WEATHERING. THIS TEAM IS USING MICROFOSSIL EVIDENCE WITH DETAILED SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY DATA TO EVALUATE IF THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE FROM SEYMOUR ISLAND IS CONSISTENT WITH A SINGLE OR DOUBLE PHASED EXTINCTION PROCESS. THE TEAM IS USING DETAILED SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY METHODS TO TEST FOR FACIES CHANGES ACROSS THE K-PG INTERVAL THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE APPARENT EARLY EXTINCTION. SAMPLES OF CORE SEDIMENTARY FORAMINIFERA, SILICEOUS MICROFOSSILS, AND CALCAREOUS NANNOFOSSILS ARE BEING EVALUATED TO PROVIDE A HIGH-RESOLUTION STRATIGRAPHIC RESOLUTION AND TO EVALUATE WHETHER EVIDENCE FOR AN EARLY EXTINCTION IS PRESENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE TEAM IS USING MULTIPLE GEOCHEMICAL METHODS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR INTERMITTENT ANOXIA OR EUXINIA AND/OR PHYSICAL RESTRICTION OF THE SEYMORE REGION BASIN.

THE TEAM IS USING SEDIMENT SAMPLES COLLECTED BELOW THE WEATHERING HORIZON TO EVALUATE DETAILED SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES, GEOCHEMISTRY, AND MICROFOSSILS IN TARGETED STRATIGRAPHIC INTERVALS. THE STUDY WILL HELP DETERMINE IF THE K-PG MASS EXTINCTION WAS A SINGLE OR DOUBLE PHASED EVENT AND WHETHER SEYMOUR ISLAND REGION IN THE GEOLOGICAL PAST WAS A RESTRICTED, SUBOXIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT OR AN OPEN WELL-MIXED SHELF. THE AWARD INCLUDES AN INTEGRATED PLAN FOR STUDENT TRAINING AT ALL LEVELS, ENHANCED BY A HIGHLIGHTED PARTNERSHIP WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EARTH SCIENCES TEACHER WORKING IN A SCHOOL SERVING UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS APPLYING MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS AN OVERARCHING RESEARCH QUESTION FOR WHICH RECENT STUDIES ARE IN DISAGREEMENT: IS THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE FROM A UNIQUE OUTCROPPING ON SEYMOUR ISLAND, ANTARCTICA CONSISTENT WITH A SINGLE OR DOUBLE PHASED EXTINCTION? IN A TWO-PHASED MODEL, THE FIRST EXTINCTION WOULD AFFECT PRIMARILY BENTHIC ORGANISMS AND WOULD HAVE OCCURRED ~150 KILOYEARS PRIOR TO A SEPARATE EXTINCTION AT THE K-PG BOUNDARY. HOWEVER, THIS EARLY EXTINCTION COULD PLAUSIBLY BE EXPLAINED BY AN UNRECOGNIZED FACIES CONTROL THAT IS OBSCURED BY SURFICIAL WEATHERING. THIS TEAM IS USING MICROFOSSIL EVIDENCE WITH DETAILED SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY DATA TO EVALUATE IF THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE FROM SEYMOUR ISLAND IS CONSISTENT WITH A SINGLE OR DOUBLE PHASED EXTINCTION PROCESS. THE TEAM IS USING DETAILED SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY METHODS TO TEST FOR FACIES CHANGES ACROSS THE K-PG INTERVAL THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE APPARENT EARLY EXTINCTION. SAMPLES OF CORE SEDIMENTARY FORAMINIFERA, SILICEOUS MICROFOSSILS, AND CALCAREOUS NANNOFOSSILS ARE BEING EVALUATED TO PROVIDE A HIGH-RESOLUTION STRATIGRAPHIC RESOLUTION AND TO EVALUATE WHETHER EVIDENCE FOR AN EARLY EXTINCTION IS PRESENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE TEAM IS USING MULTIPLE GEOCHEMICAL METHODS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR INTERMITTENT ANOXIA OR EUXINIA AND/OR PHYSICAL RESTRICTION OF THE SEYMORE REGION BASIN. DATA FROM THIS ANALYSIS WILL INDICATE IF THIS REGION WAS A RESTRICTED, SUBOXIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT OR AN OPEN WELL-MIXED SHELF.

MASS EXTINCTION -NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: THIS 4-YEAR PROJECT IS EVALUATING EVIDENCE OF EXTINCTION PATTERNS AND DEPOSITIONAL CONDITIONS FROM A HIGH SOUTHERN LATITUDE CRETACEOUS-PALEOGENE (K-PG) OUTCROP SECTION FOUND ON SEYMORE ISLAND, IN THE WESTERN ANTARCTIC PENINSULA. THE TEAM IS USING SEDIMENT SAMPLES COLLECTED BELOW THE WEATHERING HORIZON TO EVALUATE DETAILED SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES, GEOCHEMISTRY, AND MICROFOSSILS IN TARGETED STRATIGRAPHIC INTERVALS. THE STUDY WILL HELP DETERMINE IF THE K-PG MASS EXTINCTION WAS A SINGLE OR DOUBLE PHASED EVENT AND WHETHER SEYMOUR ISLAND REGION IN THE GEOLOGICAL PAST WAS A RESTRICTED, SUBOXIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT OR AN OPEN WELL-MIXED SHELF. THE AWARD INCLUDES AN INTEGRATED PLAN FOR STUDENT TRAINING AT ALL LEVELS, ENHANCED BY A HIGHLIGHTED PARTNERSHIP WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EARTH SCIENCES TEACHER WORKING IN A SCHOOL SERVING UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS APPLYING MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS AN OVERARCHING RESEARCH QUESTION FOR WHICH RECENT STUDIES ARE IN DISAGREEMENT: IS THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE FROM A UNIQUE OUTCROPPING ON SEYMOUR ISLAND, ANTARCTICA CONSISTENT WITH A SINGLE OR DOUBLE PHASED EXTINCTION? IN A TWO-PHASED MODEL, THE FIRST EXTINCTION WOULD AFFECT PRIMARILY BENTHIC ORGANISMS AND WOULD HAVE OCCURRED ~150 KILOYEARS PRIOR TO A SEPARATE EXTINCTION AT THE K-PG BOUNDARY. HOWEVER, THIS EARLY EXTINCTION COULD PLAUSIBLY BE EXPLAINED BY AN UNRECOGNIZED FACIES CONTROL THAT IS OBSCURED BY SURFICIAL WEATHERING. THIS TEAM IS USING MICROFOSSIL EVIDENCE WITH DETAILED SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY DATA TO EVALUATE IF THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE FROM SEYMOUR ISLAND IS CONSISTENT WITH A SINGLE OR DOUBLE PHASED EXTINCTION PROCESS. THE TEAM IS USING DETAILED SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY METHODS TO TEST FOR FACIES CHANGES ACROSS THE K-PG INTERVAL THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE APPARENT EARLY EXTINCTION. SAMPLES OF CORE SEDIMENTARY FORAMINIFERA, SILICEOUS MICROFOSSILS, AND CALCAREOUS NANNOFOSSILS ARE BEING EVALUATED TO PROVIDE A HIGH-RESOLUTION STRATIGRAPHIC RESOLUTION AND TO EVALUATE WHETHER EVIDENCE FOR AN EARLY EXTINCTION IS PRESENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE TEAM IS USING MULTIPLE GEOCHEMICAL METHODS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR INTERMITTENT ANOXIA OR EUXINIA AND/OR PHYSICAL RESTRICTION OF THE SEYMORE REGION BASIN. DATA FROM THIS ANALYSIS WILL INDICATE IF THIS REGION WAS A RESTRICTED, SUBOXIC MARINE ENVIRONMENT OR AN OPEN WELL-MIXED SHELF.
