"FORENSIC DNA ANALYSIS RELIES HEAVILY ON COMPARATIVE APPROACHES FOR HUMAN IDENTIFICATION, IN WHICH UNKNOWN EVIDENCE SAMPLES ARE COMPARED WITH KNOWN REFERENCE MATERIALS OR DATABASE STR PROFILES FROM PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED OFFENDERS. FOR THOSE UNKNOWN FORENSIC SAMPLES THAT DO NOT PRODUCE A DATABASE HIT AND DO NOT HAVE A REFERENCE STANDARD FOR COMPARISON, FORENSIC DNA PHENOTYPING (FDP) PRODUCES AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION TO INFER EXTERNALLY VISIBLE CHARACTERISTICS (EVCS) FROM UNIDENTIFIED GENETIC MATERIAL. THE DETERMINATION OF CHRONOLOGICAL AGE FROM HUMAN TISSUE SAMPLES IS ONE SUCH FDP TECHNIQUE THAT HAS EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS. THIS TECHNIQUE RELIES ON THE CHEMICAL CONSERVATION AND DETERMINATION OF EPIGENETIC MARKS, REFERRED TO AS METHYLATION, THAT ARE BOUND TO CYTOSINE RESIDUES AT SPECIFIED SITES OF DNA KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN AGING. BISULFITE CONVERSION (BSC) IS CURRENTLY THE GOLD STANDARD METHOD FOR METHYLATION SAMPLE PREPARATION. THIS CHEMICAL PROCESS CONVERTS THOSE CYTOSINE BASES WITHOUT METHYLATION TO URACIL, ENABLING DOWNSTREAM DETECTION. HOWEVER, CURRENT BSC METHODS ARE PRONE TO A HIGH DEGREE OF DNA FRAGMENTATION AND REQUIRE A CENTRALIZED LABORATORY, TRAINED PERSONNEL, AND SEVERAL MANUAL TUBE TRANSFER, PIPETTING, AND CENTRIFUGATION STEPS. FOR THIS REASON, BSC METHODS IN THEIR CURRENT FORM MAY NOT BE REGARDED AS IDEAL FOR FORENSIC APPLICATIONS, IN WHICH LOW LEVELS OF INPUT DNA ARE THE NORM; TIME, LABORATORY SPACE, AND RESOURCES ARE LIMITED; AND OPEN-TUBE, MANUAL PROCESSES ARE AT A HIGH RISK FOR SAMPLE CONTAMINATION. IN RESPONSE TO A SOLICITATION BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE, THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL POSITS AN ALTERNATIVE, ROTATIONALLY DRIVEN MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM FOR BSC THAT WOULD ENABLE RAPID, EFFICIENT CONVERSION OF SMALLER, FORENSICALLY RELEVANT DNA INPUT MASSES IN AN AUTOMATED, CLOSED SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED REACTION DISC WILL MINIMIZE BOTH VARIABILITY AND CONTAMINATION RISK THROUGH AUTOMATION AND INTEGRATION IN A CLOSED DEVICE. FURTHER, THE SMALL SIZE OF REACTION CHAMBERS WILL ENABLE THE USE OF REDUCED REAGENT AND DNA INPUT VOLUMES, THUS SHORTENING REQUIRED INCUBATION TIMES KNOWN TO PRODUCE DNA FRAGMENTATION AND LOSS WITH TRADITIONAL BSC TECHNIQUES. THE METHYL-PREPDISC SYSTEM WILL BE RUN ON INSTRUMENTS ALREADY OPTIMIZED WITHIN THE LANDERS LABORATORY AND WILL INTEGRATE BOTH SAMPLE LYSIS AND MAGNETIC BEAD-BASED DNA PURIFICATION AND BSC IN ONE DISPOSABLE AND OPERATIONAL DISC CAPABLE OF COMPLETING METHYLATION SAMPLE PREPARATION FOR FIVE SAMPLES IN TANDEM.\nNOTE: THIS PROJECT CONTAINS A RESEARCH AND/OR DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT, AS DEFINED IN APPLICABLE LAW, AND COMPLIES WITH PART 200 UNIFORM REQUIREMENTS - 2 CFR  200.210(A)(14).

IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY AND RETURN REMAINS FOR LEGAL, HUMANITARIAN, AND RELATED REASONS, AND COMMINGLING CAN PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. COMMINGLING RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF THE INDIVIDUALISTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUALS PRESENT AND CAN OBSTRUCT THE PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION PROCESS. AS THE ISSUE OF COMMINGLED REMAINS IS COMMON ENOUGH IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, THERE IS A NEED TO DEVISE ADEQUATE METHODS TO SORT MIXED SKELETAL ELEMENTS. ONE PARTICULARLY UNDERSTUDIED TECHNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN USED TO SORT COMMINGLED REMAINS IS JOINT ARTICULATION ANALYSIS. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION WHEN SORTING COMMINGLED BONES AT JOINT ARTICULATIONS IS THAT THE JOINT SURFACES WITHIN INDIVIDUALS WILL BE MORE SIMILAR THAN THOSE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, ALTHOUGH THIS ASSUMPTION HAS NEVER BEEN FULLY TESTED. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMS TO TEST THIS ASSUMPTION AND DETERMINE IF COMMINGLED JOINTS CAN BE SEPARATED BY USING VIRTUAL ANTHROPOLOGY (VA) METHODS. VA IS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY AND COMPUTER-ASSISTED APPROACH TO STUDYING THE ANATOMICAL DATA OF HUMANS IN THREE DIMENSIONS. SPECIFICALLY, A 3D SURFACE SCANNER WILL BE USED TO CREATE VIRTUAL MODELS OF THE BONES, WHICH ARTICULATE AT THE ATLANTO-AXIAL, SACROILIAC, AND FIRST TARSOMETATARSAL JOINTS. THESE JOINTS WERE SELECTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN EXAMINED QUANTITATIVELY, ARE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES, AND CAN JOIN DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE BODY TOGETHER (I.E., SKULL TO NECK). THE SHAPE OF THE ARTICULAR SURFACES WILL THEN BE ANALYZED WITH DEVIATION ANALYSIS, WHICH CREATES A COLOR-MAP DEVIATION SPECTRUM TO INDICATE THE OVERALL DIFFERENCES IN SURFACE GEOMETRY BETWEEN TWO SPECIFIED VIRTUAL OBJECTS. THESE COLORS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY QUANTIFIABLE VALUES THAT CAN SEPARATE COMMINGLED REMAINS AS VALUES OF SIMILARITY WITHIN AND BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. THIS RESEARCH SEEKS TO IDENTIFY IF THERE IS GREATER SHAPE VARIATION FOUND BETWEEN THE JOINTS OF COMMINGLED INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO NON-COMMINGLED INDIVIDUALS, WHILE INVESTIGATING WHICH ASPECTS OF THE JOINT SURFACES ARE MOST SIMILAR OR DISSIMILAR.  FURTHER, THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE DETERMINING IF A THRESHOLD VALUE CAN BE FOUND TO DIFFERENTIATE COMMINGLED AND NON-COMMINGLED JOINTS AND TO RANK THE EXAMINED JOINTS IN ORDER OF ABILITY TO SEPARATE COMMINGLED REMAINS BASED ON THESE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT INTENDS TO IMPROVE UPON CURRENT SEPARATION TECHNIQUES BY INCORPORATING A VIRTUAL APPROACH THAT CAN RELIABLY SORT COMMINGLED REMAINS AND BETTER INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF JOINT SHAPE VARIATION WITHIN AND BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.\nNOTE: THIS PROJECT CONTAINS A RESEARCH AND/OR DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT, AS DEFINED IN APPLICABLE LAW, AND COMPLIES WITH PART 200 UNIFORM REQUIREMENTS - 2 CFR  200.210(A)(14).

IDENTIFICATION EFFORTS CAN BE COMPLICATED IN ROUTINE INVESTIGATIONS OF NON-NATURAL DEATHS AND EVEN MORE SO IN THE EVENT OF MASS DEATHS. FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGISTS WORK WITH PROFESSIONALS IN THE MEDICOLEGAL FIELD TO IDENTIFY UNKNOWN DECEDENTS IN THESE CASES. EFFICIENCY IN OBTAINING POSITIVE IDENTIFICATIONS REQUIRES ACCURATE METHODS FOR ESTIMATING THE BIOLOGICAL PROFILE, INCLUDING THE AGE, SEX, ANCESTRY, AND STATURE OF THE DECEDENT. CURRENT METHODS USED IN THE UNITED STATES ARE PREDOMINATELY BASED ON INDIVIDUALS OF EUROPEAN AND/OR AFRICAN DESCENT; AS SUCH, THESE METHODS DO NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF THE BIOLOGICAL PROFILE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT BELONG TO THESE GROUPS. THE LACK OF VARIATION IN CURRENT METHODS IS PROBLEMATIC IN THE UNITED STATES AS THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED MIGRATION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. ACCORDING TO THE MIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE, THE NUMBER OF ASIAN IMMIGRANTS IN THE U.S. INCREASED 2,597% FROM 1960 TO 2014, THUS REPRESENTING 30% OF THE U.S. FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION. IN FACT, THE ASIAN RACE CATEGORY IS THE FASTEST GROWING POPULATION OF ANY RACE CATEGORY IN THE U.S. AS ASIAN MIGRATION INTO THE U.S. CONTINUES TO RISE, SO WILL THE NEED TO CREATE AND UTILIZE POPULATION-SPECIFIC METHODS FOR ESTIMATING THE BIOLOGICAL PROFILE OF UNKNOWN DECEDENTS. BASED ON PRELIMINARY RESULTS, IT IS CLEAR THAT CURRENT ANCESTRY AND SEX ESTIMATION METHODS DO NOT ACCURATELY CLASSIFY JAPANESE INDIVIDUALS. TO ADDRESS THIS DEFICIENCY IN CURRENT METHODS, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE A REFERENCE DATABASE FOR ASIAN POPULATIONS TO GENERATE STATISTICAL MODELS THAT WILL AID IN THE ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF SEX AND ANCESTRY OF UNKNOWN DECEDENTS. THIS PROJECT WILL INCORPORATE FOUR DATA TYPES, INCLUDING CRANIOMETRICS, CRANIAL NONMETRICS AND MACROMORPHOSCOPICS, ODONTOMETRICS, AND DENTAL MORPHOLOGY. DATA WILL BE COLLECTED FROM JAPANESE, SOUTH KOREAN, AND THAI SKELETAL POPULATIONS. THE SAMPLES WILL BE USED TO CREATE A REFERENCE DATABASE OF ASIAN CRANIAL AND DENTAL METRIC AND NONMETRIC DATA, WHICH WILL THEN BE USED TO BUILD PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE ANCESTRY AND SEX OF INDIVIDUALS FROM THESE GROUPS. BY CREATING BIOLOGICAL PROFILE ESTIMATION MODELS BASED ON ALL FOUR DATA TYPES COMMONLY USED BY PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD, THIS PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY IMPACT THE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS WITHIN FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY, CRIMINAL JUSTICE, AND THE MEDICOLEGAL SYSTEM.\nNOTE: THIS PROJECT CONTAINS A RESEARCH AND/OR DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT, AS DEFINED IN APPLICABLE LAW, AND COMPLIES WITH PART 200 UNIFORM REQUIREMENTS - 2 CFR  200.210(A)(14).

ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (AM) HAS OPENED A WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES FOR CRIMINALS TO DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE ITEMS USED IN CRIMES INCLUDING FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES, AND MORE INNOCUOUS ITEMS SUCH AS KEYS OR BANKING CARD INTERFACES. WHEN SUCH ITEMS ARE DISCOVERED AT THE SCENE OF A CRIME, FORENSICS INVESTIGATORS ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY OR TRACE THE ORIGIN OF THE RAW MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING DEVICES. THIS PROJECT PROPOSED TO CONDUCT FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY THE ELEMENTAL, MOLECULAR, CHEMICAL, THERMAL, MECHANICAL, AND SURFACE MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY THE MATERIALS, MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AND POTENTIALLY FINGERPRINT THE EXACT PRINTER USED TO CONSTRUCT PIECES OF 3D PRINTED EVIDENCE.\n\nTHIS WORK WILL INCLUDE MATERIALS RESEARCH TO INCREASE THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE IN FORENSIC INVESTIGATORS TOOLKITS. WE INTEND TO STUDY VARIOUS STATE-OF-THE-ART 3D PRINTERS THAT USE ADVANCED MATERIALS AND TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE METHODS TO IDENTIFY FEATURES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF 3D PRINTING AND RAW PRINT MATERIALS THAT INVESTIGATORS CAN USE TO IDENTIFY UNIQUE MARKERS IN A WEAPON OR PRODUCT THAT WOULD CONFIRM THE PRINTER OR CLASS OF PRINTER THAT MADE IT.\n\nTHIS IS A TWO-PHASE RESEARCH PROPOSAL; 1) CHARACTERIZATION OF PREPRINT MATERIALS AND BULK PRINT MATERIALS, AND, 2) CHARACTERIZATION OF 3D PRINTED FIREARMS IN PRISTINE AND STRESSED CONDITIONS. IN PHASE 1, A BROAD RANGE OF AM MATERIALS WILL BE ANALYZED USING TGA, DSC, SEM, EDS, CT SCAN, AND FTIR. ANALYZED MATERIALS WILL INCLUDE TRADITIONAL POLYMERS (ABS AND PLA) AND STATE OF THE ART FIBER REINFORCED POLYMERS, VAT-PHOTO RESINS, AND LASER SINTERED METALS. THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES WILL BE EVALUATED IN RAW, PRE-PRINT FORM AND AFTER PRINTING. CRITICAL PARAMETERS WILL BE IDENTIFIED FOR TRACING THE PART TO THE RAW MATERIAL AND TO THE PRINTER. PHASE 2 WILL EVALUATE 3D PRINTED FIREARMS. THE MEASURED PROPERTIES OF THE FIREARMS WILL BE EVALUATED BEFORE AND AFTER FIRING, AND BEFORE AND AFTER EXPOSURE TO CHEMICAL OR THERMAL STIMULI. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL DETERMINE IF THE FIREARM CAN BE TRACED TO THE RAW MATERIAL AND PRINTER IN BOTH PRISTINE AND STRESSED STATES.\nPRIMARY DELIVERABLES WILL INCLUDE PROOF OF CONCEPT AND BEST PRACTICES FOR CHARACTERIZATION AND SOURCE TRACING OF 3D PRINTED OBJECTS. IN ADDITION, A DATABASE OF CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS FOR THE MATERIALS EVALUATED WILL BE PRODUCED, AND A SET OF CHARACTERISTICS TO EXAMINE FOR LINKING AN OBJECT TO THE SOURCE PRINTER.

OF TECHNOLOGY\nBY CRIMINALS TO COMMIT CRIMES AND FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT (LE) INVESTIGATING CRIMES. BECAUSE OF THIS RAPID GROWTH, THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS STRUGGLED TO KEEP PACE AND THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR DE BEST PRACTICES AMONG LES AND CRIME LABORATORIES REMAINS LIMITED. THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE SPECIFIC INVESTIGATIVE, TESTING, AND COORDINATION NEEDS OF LE AND CRIME LABORATORY PRACTITIONERS AND TO PRODUCE PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE ON THE USES AND VALUE OF DE, INCLUDING INCREASING INVESTIGATIVE INTELLIGENCE AND PROBATIVE VALUE.\n\nTHIS STUDY WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THREE PHASES. PHASE 1 WILL CONSIST OF A PAIRED SURVEY WITH A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 67 CRIME LABORATORIES (REPRESENTING LABORATORIES IN 31 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA) AND UP TO 201 LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE SURVEYS WILL INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DE CASELOAD, RESOURCE NEEDS, AND DE SUBMISSION, MANAGEMENT, AND ANALYSIS PRACTICES WITHIN AND ACROSS JURISDICTIONS. RESULTS WILL YIELD A TAXONOMY OF DE APPROACHES BY LE AND CRIME LABORATORIES TO ESTABLISH A FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE BASE. PHASE 2 WILL BUILD ON THE SURVEY FINDINGS BY SELECTING SIX JURISDICTIONS USING CASELOAD MEASURES THAT SHOW HIGH AND LOW DE PROCESSING RATES, IN ADDITION TO OTHER CRITERIA (E.G., PRESENCE OF EVIDENCE LIAISONS). THE IN-DEPTH QUALITATIVE STUDY WILL INVOLVE INTERVIEWING DE CRIME LABORATORY SUPERVISORS AND THE LE INVESTIGATORS TO GAIN A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR PROCESSES, PROCEDURES, COMMUNICATION, AND COORDINATION BETWEEN THE AGENCIES (24 TOTAL INTERVIEWS). PHASE 3 WILL COMBINE THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM THE PHASE 1 AND 2 STUDY COMPONENTS TO DEVELOP AN EVIDENCE-BASED BRIEF FOR CRIME LABORATORIES AND LE AGENCIES THAT SHOWS PROMISING DE CASE INVESTIGATION PRACTICES.

THE USE OF MARIJUANA IS KNOWN TO SEVERELY IMPAIR SKILLS PERTINENT FOR SAFE DRIVING. IDENTIFYING DRIVERS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MARIJUANA IS IMPORTANT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS WOULD REQUIRE NON-INVASIVE QUANTIFICATION OF THE PSYCHOACTIVE COMPOUND TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC) IN BREATH CONDENSATE OR ORAL FLUID AT THE ROADSIDE. HOWEVER, DEVICES FOR THESE PURPOSES ARE EITHER FAR FROM COMMERCIALIZATION OR DO NOT HAVE THE REQUISITE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP A DEVICE LIKE THE STANDARD ALCOHOL BREATH ANALYZER THAT CAN BE USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL TO ACCURATELY QUANTIFY THC LEVELS NON-INVASIVELY IN ROADSIDE SCENARIOS.\n\nTHIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING AN APTAMER-MODIFIED PAPER ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE (APED) THAT CAN BE USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AS A USER-FRIENDLY TOOL TO QUANTIFY THC IN THE ORAL FLUID OF DRIVERS. THE DEVICE WILL REQUIRE ONLY ~10-20 MICROLITERS OF SAMPLE AND PROVIDES RESULTS IN A DIGITAL READOUT WITHIN SECONDS. THIS PROJECT HAS THREE AIMS.

CRANIOMETRIC DATA IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED DATA SOURCE FOR THIS TASK. MULTIPLE STATISTICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR CRANIOMETRIC ANCESTRY ESTIMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS (LDA), GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS (GM), MIXTURE MODEL-BASED CLUSTERING, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI). WHILE LDA REMAINS THE MOST COMMONLY USED METHOD, AI OR MACHINE LEARNING-BASED METHODS OFTEN OUTPERFORM TRADITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS (E.G., LDA) AS THE ACCURACY OF THE PREDICTIONS. CURRENTLY, THE STATE-OF-ART SOFTWARE FOR CRANIOMETRIC ANCESTRY ESTIMATION BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING IS ANCESTREES, WHICH USES A TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING METHOD, RANDOM FOREST. THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY WITH THEIR 6-GROUP (EUROPEAN, AFRICAN, AUSTRO-MELANESIAN, POLYNESIAN, NATIVE AMERICAN, EAST ASIAN) MODEL IS ABOUT 80% WHILE USING THEIR TEST SAMPLES FROM AFRICA AND EUROPE. THIS ACCURACY IS BASED ON TRADITIONAL CALIPER MEASUREMENTS. ANOTHER TYPE OF CRANIOMETRIC DATA IS 3D COORDINATES OF CRANIO-LANDMARKS AND A POPULAR DATABASE OF THIS TYPE OF DATA IS 3D-ID. HOWEVER, RECENT 3D-ID\u2019S ANCESTRY ESTIMATION ALGORITHM EVALUATIONS SHOWED THAT ITS ACCURACY MIGHT BE LOWER THAN LDA WITH CALIPER MEASUREMENTS. \n\nOUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE CRANIOMETRIC ANCESTRY ESTIMATION ACCURACY CAN BE FURTHER IMPROVED USING DEEP LEARNING (DL). DL IS A RECENT BREAKTHROUGH IN AI THAT HAS SURPASSED THE TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS IN MANY AREAS. ITS REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS IN BIOLOGY, INCLUDING SOME FROM OUR LAB, SUGGESTED THAT ITS GOOD PERFORMANCE NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRES LARGE DATA SETS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO DEVELOP DEEP LEARNING MODELS TO ESTIMATE ANCESTRY USING CRANIOMETRIC DATA. SPECIFICALLY, WE PLAN TO PURSUE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1: USE DEEP LEARNING METHODS TO BUILD PREDICTION MODELS TO CLASSIFY A SKULL OF UNKNOWN ANCESTRY TO EACH OF THE SIX GROUPS (EUROPEAN, AFRICAN, EAST ASIAN, AFRICAN AMERICAN/EUROPEAN-AFRICAN ADMIX, LATIN AMERICAN/EUROPEAN-AMERICAN-AFRICAN ADMIX, MIDDLE EASTERN/EUROPEAN-EAST-ASIAN ADMIX) WITH ASSOCIATED PROBABILITIES USING THE 3D-ID DATA SET. OUR MODELS WILL ALSO HANDLE INCOMPLETE SKULLS AND PROVIDE UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION. AIM 2: COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MODELS WITH THE ORIGINAL 3D-ID ALGORITHM, USING INDEPENDENT TEST DATA. AIM 3: IMPLEMENT OUR MODELS INTO A WEB SERVICE FOR OTHER RESEARCHERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS. \n\nTHE DELIVERABLES WILL BE NOVEL DL METHODS FOR CRANIOMETRIC ANCESTRY ESTIMATION AND A WEB SERVICE IMPLEMENTING THE METHODS. THEY WILL BENEFIT THE FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS USING FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY TO MATCH SKULLS OF UNKNOWN INDIVIDUALS TO MISSING PERSONS.

WHILE DISPERSAL PATTERNS AND DIRECT DAMAGE TO BONE FROM FEEDING HAVE BEEN STUDIED FOR TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS AND INLAND AVIAN SPECIES, VERY LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO MARINE SHORE CONTEXTS AND THE ROLE THAT SEA BIRDS PLAY IN DISPERSAL OF BONES. THE SHOALS MARINE LABORATORY IS LOCATED ON APPLEDORE ISLAND, ME, USA, WHICH ALSO IS HOME TO LARGE COLONIES OF SEASONALLY NESTING GULL (LARIDAE) SPECIES, PRIMARILY HERRING GULL (LARUS ARGENTATUS) AND GREAT BLACK BACKED GULLS (L. MARINUS). THESE SPECIES ARE KNOWN SCAVENGERS THAT HAVE BEEN LITTLE STUDIED FOR THEIR DIRECT EFFECTS UPON LARGE VERTEBRATE REMAINS. THE ISLAND SETTING ALLOWS FOR STUDIES THAT ISOLATE THE BEHAVIOR OF AVIAN SPECIES DUE TO THE LACK OF ANY LARGE TERRESTRIAL SCAVENGERS, ESPECIALLY CANIDS, THUS PREVENTING THE NEED FOR SAMPLES TO BE PLACED ON PLATFORMS, WITHIN FENCES, OR OTHER ARTIFICIAL SCAVENGING SCENARIOS. A PILOT PROJECT IN 2021 DETERMINED THAT BOTH SPECIES FED UPON AND DISPERSED ISOLATED, FRESH CATTLE (BOS TAURUS) CERVICAL VERTEBRAE AN AVERAGE DISTANCE OF 10\u00a0M AND A MAXIMUM OF 85\u00a0M.\n\nTHE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL EXAMINE THE DISPERSAL AND FEEDING DAMAGE CAUSED ON LARGE VERTEBRATE REMAINS IN FIVE OVERLAPPING STAGES: (1) SCAVENGING UPON FRESH, ISOLATED NONHUMAN LONG BONES AND CRANIA; (2) SCAVENGING UPON INTRODUCED WHOLE PIG (SUS SCROFA) CARCASSES; (3) SCAVENGING UPON NATURALLY OCCURRING HARBOR SEAL (PHOCA VITULINA) CARCASSES; (4) COLLECTION OF NONHUMAN BONES SCAVENGED FROM HUMAN-GENERATED TRASH ON THE MAINLAND AND TRANSPORTED TO THE ISLAND BY THE GULLS TO PROVISION THEIR YOUNG; AND (5) GPS TRACKING OF ADULT GULLS TO DETERMINE THEIR FORAGING DISTANCES AND LOCATIONS, INCLUDING NEAR AND WITHIN URBAN AREAS, IN THIS COASTAL ENVIRONMENT. THESE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON AVIAN FEEDING AND DISPERSAL IN AN INLAND TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENT IN HOLLISTON, MA. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT LARIDAE SPECIES WILL DISPERSE BONE AT GREATER DISTANCES THAN INLAND AVIAN SPECIES DUE TO THEIR AGGRESSIVE FLOCKING BEHAVIOR AND VOCAL SIGNALLING OF OTHER BIRDS UPON THE DISCOVERY OF FOOD SOURCES. IT IS ALSO HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE DAMAGE PATTERNS CAUSED BY GULL FEEDING CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE TAPHONOMIC EFFECTS OF OTHER SCAVENGING SPECIES AND FROM HUMAN-CAUSED TRAUMA. THE DISPERSAL RESULTS WILL BE USED TO FORMULATE BEST SEARCH AND RECOVERY PRACTICES FOR DISPERSED HUMAN REMAINS IN COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS.

TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVE 1, THE RESEARCH\u00a0TEAM WILL IDENTIFY, SYNTHESIZE, AND SUMMARIZE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES AT ALL STAGES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS PLAN WILL INCLUDE POLICE DECISIONS TO ARREST, TO STOP-AND-FRISK OR STOP-AND-SEARCH, AND TO USE FORCE (INCLUDING EXCESSIVE AND DEADLY FORCE); PRETRIAL DECISIONS REGARDING BAIL, DETENTION, AND DIVERSION; PROSECUTORS' CHARGING AND PLEA BARGAINING DECISIONS; JURY SELECTION OUTCOMES, INCLUDING USE OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES; JUDGES' SENTENCING DECISIONS IN CAPITAL AND NONCAPITAL CASES AND PROBATION REVOCATION DECISIONS; JUVENILE JUSTICE OUTCOMES, INCLUDING INTAKE, DETENTION, ADJUDICATION, AND PLACEMENT, AS WELL AS DECISIONS TO WAIVE OR TRANSFER JUVENILES TO ADULT CRIMINAL COURT; AND CORRECTIONAL OFFICIALS' DECISIONS TO GRANT OR REVOKE PAROLE. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL IDENTIFY STRUCTURAL AND CONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO RESULT IN DISPARATE TREATMENT.

HOWEVER, THERE REPORTEDLY IS NO RESEARCH TO DATE THAT EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH REMOVING SBLE MIGHT SHAPE OUTCOMES RELATED TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CONTACT OR THE ATTENDANT RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF REMOVING SBLE ON RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CONTACT. TO ACHIEVE THE STUDY\u2019S GOAL, THE APPLICANT WILL DRAW ON TWO SECONDARY DATA SOURCES: 1) THE SCHOOL SURVEY ON CRIME AND SAFETY, WHICH IS A BIENNIAL NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. 2) THE CIVIL RIGHTS DATA COLLECTION, WHICH IS A BIENNIAL CENSUS OF U.S. PUBLIC SCHOOLS. EACH OF THESE DATA SOURCES WILL BE USED TO CONSTRUCT A TWO-WAVE LONGITUDINAL DATASET THAT WILL IDENTIFY SCHOOLS THAT REMOVED OR DID NOT REMOVE SBLE. USING A DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES APPROACH, THIS STUDY WILL COMPARE CHANGES IN THREE MEASURES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE CONTACT (I.E., ARRESTS, REFERRALS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND CRIMES REPORTED TO POLICE) IN SCHOOLS THAT REMOVED SBLE RELATIVE TO THE CHANGES IN SCHOOLS THAT DID NOT REMOVE SBLE. THE APPLICANT WILL EXAMINE WITHIN-SCHOOL RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN RATES OF ARREST AND REFERRALS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND BETWEEN-SCHOOL DIFFERENCES IN ALL THREE MEASURES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CONTACT BY SCHOOL RACIAL COMPOSITION.

THESE CHALLENGES REQUIRE EVALUATING CURRENTLY USED METHODS AND IDENTIFYING AVENUES FOR GENERATING MORE RELIABLE, REPRODUCIBLE, ACCURATE, AND UNBIASED RESULTS. IN GENERAL, IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE BROKEN INTO TWO SEPARATE CONSIDERATIONS--TECHNOLOGY AND METHODOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS.\n\nWHEN SAMPLES ARE SEIZED FOR SUBSEQUENT FORENSIC LABORATORY ANALYSIS, AN ANALYTICAL WORKFLOW OF MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES IS USED TO ACHIEVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF SELECTIVITY FOR A SCIENTIFICALLY SUPPORTED CONCLUSION. THIS IS GENERALLY A MULTISTEP PROCESS THAT INCLUDES SCREENING AND CONFIRMATION. COLOR TESTING IS THE PREDOMINANT SCREENING METHOD USED BECAUSE OF THE LOW COST, QUICK TURNAROUND TIME FOR RESULTS, AND SIMPLICITY IN WHICH COLOR CHANGES ARE OBSERVED VISUALLY. HOWEVER, COLOR TEST LIMITATIONS CAN INCLUDE SUBJECTIVE COLOR INTERPRETATION, IMPROPER TEST USE, FULLY MANUAL PROCEDURE, INCORRECT RESULTS REPORTED, UNCONTROLLED SUBSTANCE INTERFERENTS, AND MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL COLOR TESTS REQUIRED FOR ILLICIT DRUG IDENTIFICATION, WHICH ALL PROVIDE THE POTENTIAL FOR USER ERROR OR UNRELIABLE RESULTS.\n\nCUTTING-EDGE MICROFLUIDIC TECHNOLOGIES FROM ADJACENT INDUSTRIES CAN OFFER SEVERAL ADVANTAGES TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES THROUGH AUTOMATION, OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS, PERFORMING MULTIPLE TESTS IN PARALLEL, AND COMPATIBILITY WITH LABORATORY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (LIMS). PHASE 1 OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE AN INNOVATIVE MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM FOR AUTOMATING ROUTINE COLOR TEST PROCEDURES AND PERFORMING MULTIPLE TESTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. SUBSEQUENTLY, PHASE 2 WILL FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEMENTARY OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS, PROVIDING A ROBUST QUANTITATIVE METRIC FOR INTERPRETING COLOR TEST RESULTS THAT IS UNBIASED, TRACEABLE, AND LIMS-COMPATIBLE. WHILE PHASES 1 AND 2 AIM TO IMPROVE WORKFLOWS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS, PHASE 3 WILL INVESTIGATE PRACTITIONER-IDENTIFIED METHOD-BASED IMPROVEMENTS BY UTILIZING THE MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM TO INCORPORATE AND INVESTIGATE DRUG IMMUNOASSAYS TO AUGMENT ROUTINE COLOR TESTS.\u00a0\n\nBECAUSE THE RESULTS FROM FORENSIC LABORATORY WORKFLOWS ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE OUTCOMES, IT IS CRUCIAL TO INCREASE CONFIDENCE IN THESE TESTS AND PROVIDE IMPROVEMENTS TO INCORPORATE UNBIASED AND QUANTIFIABLE METRICS. THIS WORK WILL BE PERFORMED ON A READILY AVAILABLE MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM FOR MORE STREAMLINED TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION AND IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS. ADVANCED MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORMS ARE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR ADDRESSING CURRENT CHALLENGES IN A FORMAT THAT CAN ALSO BE ADAPTABLE FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS AND FORENSIC WORKFLOW CHANGES, SUCH AS THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT AND ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW COLOR TEST FOR CANNABIS TYPIFICATION.

HANDLING AFFECT JUVENILE REOFFENDING AND TO PILOT TEST AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF NEW INTAKE PRACTICES ON REOFFENDING. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY GAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT JUVENILE COURT PRACTICES; USING FINDINGS AND INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A BRIEF INTAKE RISK SCREENING TOOL, RISK LEVEL CLASSIFICATION, AND DECISION SUPPORT GUIDE FOR INITIAL CASE HANDLING; AND IMPLEMENTING AND PILOTING THE NEW INTAKE RISK SCREENING PROCEDURES AND EXAMINING THE IMPACTS ON REOFFENDING. PRODUCTS AND DELIVERABLES: PRODUCTS AND DELIVERABLES INCLUDE DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENTS; DATA SETS; POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND PROTOCOLS; AND SCHOLARLY PRODUCTS. QUANTITATIVE (I.E., SURVEY OF JJ PRACTITIONERS) AND QUALITATIVE (I.E., INTERVIEW AND FOCUS GROUP GUIDES) DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENTS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO ASSESS JUVENILE COURT PRACTICES. DATA SETS CONTAINING YOUTH COURT PROCESSING INFORMATION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO NACJD. AT THE END OF THE PILOT PERIOD, THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL HAVE A VALIDATED BRIEF RISK SCREENING TOOL, RISK LEVEL CLASSIFICATION, AND DECISION SUPPORT GUIDE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY JJ PRACTITIONERS. SERVICE AREA: THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED IN MISSISSIPPI, A HIGH POVERTY, RURAL STATE WITH VERY LIMITED JJ RESOURCES AND SERVICES FOR JUSTICE-INVOLVED YOUTH. BENEFICIARIES OF PROPOSED PROJECT: RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THE HIGH SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL COST INCURRED WHEN YOUTH WHO ARE UNLIKELY TO REOFFEND ARE FORMALLY PROCESSED THROUGH THE JJ SYSTEM. THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED FROM THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, ESPECIALLY USE OF RISK AND REOFFENDING DATA FOR GUIDING JJ POLICIES AND PRACTICES, CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER JJ JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT DO NOT USE REOFFENDING RISK SCREENING AT THE FRONT END OF THE SYSTEM.

THE DESIGN INCLUDES A COLLECTION OF PRIMARY, PROSPECTIVE, QUANTITATIVE DATA (ONLINE SURVEY MODULES) AND IN-DEPTH QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS (EVERY OTHER MONTH, BY TELEPHONE OR VIDEOCONFERENCING). THE PROJECT INCLUDES THREE BROAD, INTERCONNECTED PHASES THAT WILL BE EXECUTED BY A RESEARCH TEAM AND ONE OF THE FEW U.S.-BASED NONGOVERNMENTAL COUNTERTERRORISM PROGRAMS. THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINAL DATA SET OF UP TO 100 INDIVIDUALS EXITING EXTREMIST GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES. PHASE I WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A SERIES OF SURVEY MODULES AND INTERVIEWS TO ASSESS WHITE SUPREMACIST IDEATION AND BEHAVIORS, AS WELL AS SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF EXTREMISM, AND ON OBTAINING INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD APPROVAL. DURING PHASE II, THE FOCUS WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD COLLECTING DATA TO BUILD THE DATA SET OF INDIVIDUALS EXITING EXTREMISM. THE LONGITUDINAL DATABASE WILL BE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A DETAILED FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS RELATED TO ENTRY INTO AND EXIT OUT OF EXTREMIST GROUPS. PHASE III WILL BE FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS AND REPORTING FROM MULTIPLE SURVEYS OF AND INTERVIEWS WITH EACH OF THE 100 PARTICIPANTS. THE ANALYSIS AND REPORTING WILL HIGHLIGHT LESSONS THAT INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS, AND THEIR PROGRAMS, CAN LEARN FROM THE PARTICIPANTS AND WILL BE THE BASIS OF A TERRORISM PREVENTION GUIDEBOOK. THE GUIDEBOOK WILL BE ONE OF A ROBUST AND MULTIFACETED VARIETY OF DELIVERABLES, INCLUDING OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH-ORIENTED RESEARCH BRIEFS AND A SERIES OF PEER-REVIEWED MANUSCRIPTS.

DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS WHO ARE STOPPED BY THE ACPD OFFICERS FOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE CONTROL OR THE TREATMENT GROUP. THE RANDOMIZATION PROCESS WILL ASSIGN A TOTAL OF 1100 DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS TO THE TREATMENT GROUP (ENHANCED PROCEDURAL JUSTICE PROTOCOL), AND 900 DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS TO THE CONTROL GROUP (TYPICAL ENCOUNTER WITHOUT ANY INTERVENTION). A TOTAL OF 2000 TRAFFIC STOPS WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE PARTNER AGENCIES. THE SELECTION OF EXPERIMENTAL/CONTROL CONDITIONS WILL BE GUIDED BY A RANDOM DRAWING FROM A SHUFFLED PACK OF INDEX CARDS.\n\nTHE ENHANCED STRATEGY WILL EXTEND THE EXISTING PROCEDURAL JUSTICE PRACTICES BY OFFERING DATA EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY STOPS, MAKING VIDEO EVIDENCE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC, AND INCORPORATING A STATEMENT TO EXISTING TRAFFIC STOP PROTOCOLS TO INFORM CITIZENS THAT THEIR INTERACTION IS BEING RECORDED AND CAN BE VIEWED THROUGH A WEBSITE. FOLLOWING THE POLICE-CITIZEN ENCOUNTER, DRIVERS WILL BE ASKED WHETHER THEY ARE WILLING TO VOLUNTEER TO ANSWER A BRIEF QUESTIONNAIRE (APPROXIMATELY THIRTY-LIKERT-SCALE ITEMS AND KEY DEMOGRAPHICS). \n\nTHIS STUDY WILL GENERATE NEW IDEAS FOR PRACTITIONERS ON EXPANDING THE APPLICATION OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE DURING TRAFFIC STOPS. WE ANTICIPATE THIS NEW INTERVENTION WILL HELP POLICE DEPARTMENTS REFORMULATE POLICY PERTAINING TO CITIZEN-POLICE INTERACTION DURING A TRAFFIC STOP. WE ALSO ENVISION THAT EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE TRAINING FOR POLICE OFFICERS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED PROCEDURALLY JUST TRAFFIC STOP PROTOCOLS WILL MITIGATE THE DECLINING TRUST BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY WHILE ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO RESEARCH REGARDING POLICE TRAINING, CITIZEN INTERACTION PROTOCOLS, AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS.

THIS STUDY WILL EXPLORE HOW COVID-19 AFFECTED THE DEMAND FOR VICTIM SERVICE PROVISION, THE IMPACT OF LOCAL CULTURE AND MANDATES ON VICTIM SERVICE PROVISION, AND THE SHORT-TERM AND SUSTAINED CHANGES TO SERVICE MODELS BASED ON INNOVATION AND/OR MODERNIZATION THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE ALSO WILL EXAMINE WHETHER THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THESE PHENOMENA REGIONALLY, IN RURAL AND URBAN SETTINGS, AND AMONG SPECIFIC TYPES OF VSPS. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS, THIS STUDY INCLUDES A SAMPLE OF EIGHT COUNTY-LEVEL SITES FROM FOUR STATES, REPRESENTING VARIED URBANICITY AND REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES. FOR EACH COUNTY, WE WILL CONDUCT AN IN-DEPTH POLICY ANALYSIS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CULTURAL CONTEXT IN WHICH VSPS WERE OPERATING DURING THE PANDEMIC, A WEB-BASED SURVEY OF COUNTY VSPS, IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH A SUBSET OF VSP STAKEHOLDERS, AND ONE AGENCY CASE STUDY.
