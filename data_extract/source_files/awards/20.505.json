THE PROJECT FUNDING SERVES TO CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY AND SITE SELECTION STUDY FOR A TRANSFER FACILITY; DEVELOP A PLAN FOR SERVICE EXPANSION/COORDINATION; PUBLISH TRANSIT DATA IN GENERAL TRANSIT FEED SPECIFICATION (GTFS); AND CONDUCT AN INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM (ITS) ASSESSMENT FOR BUSES IN A COORDINATED EFFORT AMONG GALLUP RURAL TRANSIT NAVAJO NATION AND PUEBLO OF ZUNI IN THE NM REGION OF NEW MEXICO. NMDOT WILL MANAGE THE PROJECT. NMDOT HAS A COMPETITIVELY PROCURED ON-CALL CONTRACTOR TO CONDUCT THE WORK. THE PLAN IS TO USE THE SAME CONTRACTOR FOR EACH STUDY TO ENSURE CONTINUITY.GALLUP IS THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR EMPLOYMENT HEALTHCARE ADDICTION SERVICES EDUCATION SHOPPING AND RECREATION. GALLUP EXPRESS OPERATES TRANSIT SERVICE IN GALLUP. PUEBLO OF ZUNI AND NAVAJO NATION OPERATE SERVICE TO AND FROM GALLUP AND WITHIN THEIR RESERVATIONS. FOR MANY TRIPS ZUNI AND NAVAJO RIDERS MUST TRANSFER TO GALLUP EXPRESS. THERE IS NO CENTRAL TRANSFER POINT OR FACILITY. EACH PROVIDER HAS A SEPARATE SCHEDULE FARE STRUCTURE AND MEDIA AND STOPS. NAVAJO COMMUNITIES ALONG THE ZUNI BORDER HAVE NO TRANSIT SERVICE. THESE COMMUNITIES TRAVEL THROUGH ZUNI TO GALLUP. IMPROVED SERVICE TO ALBUQUERQUE IS NEEDED. THE PROPOSED WORK PLAN IS TO: CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY AND SITE SELECTION STUDY FOR A TRANSFER FACILITY; DEVELOP A PLAN FOR SERVICE EXPANSION/COORDINATION COORDINATION STOP ENHANCEMENTS AND FARE COORDINATION; PUBLISH TRANSIT DATA IN GENERAL TRANSIT FEED SPECIFICATION (GTFS); AND CONDUCT AN INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM (ITS) ASSESSMENT FOR BUSES. THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS TRANSIT SERVICE OPERATED BY NAVAJO NATION IN OPPORTUNITY ZONES 35031943902 AND 35031945200.PURPOSE: GALLUP EXPRESS NAVAJO NATION AND PUEBLO OF ZUNI EACH OPERATE TRANSIT SERVICES WITHIN OR TO AND FROM GALLUP. THE SERVICE AREA IS LOW INCOME. SERVICES OVERLAP FARES AND FARE MEDIA ARE NOT COORDINATED NO TRANSFER CENTER EXISTS AND PASSENGER AMENITIES ARE LACKING. THE LACK OF A TRANSFER CENTER REDUCES CONVENIENCE AND RAISES SAFETY ISSUES. PASSENGERS MUST TRANSFER AT STOPS ON SIDE STREETS WITHOUT AMENITIES AND SECURITY. THERE IS NO TRIP PLANNER SO PASSENGERS MUST READ MULTIPLE SCHEDULES TO COMPLETE A TRIP. THE HIGH VOLUME OF TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR SCHEDULE INFORMATION AND ARRIVAL INFORMATION TAKES STAFF TIME AWAY FROM OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL DUTIES. AREAS OF THE NAVAJO NATION THAT BORDER THE PUEBLO ZUNI HAVE NO TRANSIT SERVICE AND BECAUSE OF LOCAL TRAVEL PATTERNS IT APPEARS THAT THE SERVICE MAY BE BETTER PROVIDED BY ZUNI. THERE ARE THREE FARE STRUCTURES AND TRANSFER POLICIES WHICH DISCOURAGES TRANSFERS AND RAISES THE FARE. SERVICE TO ALBUQUERQUE NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED. THESE AND OTHER ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING QUARTERLY MEETINGS THE PROVIDERS AND NMDOT HOLD TO DISCUSS SERVICES AND COORDINATION.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES: THE PROJECT WILL: IMPROVE SYSTEM CONDITION BY DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR A SAFE AND SECURE TRANSFER FACILITY AND IDENTIFYING NEW STOPS AND STOP ENHANCEMENTS; IMPROVE SERVICE RELIABILITY THROUGH AN ASSESSMENT OF ITS BUS TECHNOLOGIES GTFS AND REDUCED WAIT TIME FOR TRANSFERS; ENHANCE ACCESS AND MOBILITY THROUGH EXPANDED AND COORDINATED SERVICE FEWER AND COORDINATED TRANSFERS AND TRIP PLANNING; AND ACCELERATE THE INTRODUCTION OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGH AN ASSESSMENT OF ITS TECHNOLOGIES AND PUBLICATION OF GTFS DATA.INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: GALLUP EXPRESS NAVAJO NATION AND PUEBLO OF ZUNI TRANSIT AGENCIES AND ALL RIDERSHIP IN AND AROUND THE AREA OF IMPACT.SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: NMDOT HAS RECEIVED COMMITMENT LETTERS FROM GALLUP EXPRESS NAVAJO NATION AND PUEBLO OF ZUNI TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY AND OFFER A STAFF COMMITMENT TO DO SO.
