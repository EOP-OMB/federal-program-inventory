THE PAPER AMENDMENT CONTAINING MORE DETAILS HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO THIS AWARD RECORD.THE BUDGET/TIMELINE FOR THE PROJECT WAS ADJUSTED AND HAS BEEN ADJUSTED IN THE ALI MILESTONES AND THE SCOPE WAS MODIFIED. THE ORIGINAL TIGER V GRANT SCOPE CONTAINS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE STATING PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS AT ALL SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE CROSSING TIMES AND INCREASE SAFETY FOR PEDESTRIANS. AS WE PROCEEDED WITH THE DESIGN OF IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL INTERSECTIONS ON THE MURFREESBORO ROAD CORRIDOR THE PROJECT TEAM DETERMINED THAT 2 INTERSECTIONS MERIT CONSIDERATION FOR BEING EXCEPTIONS TO THIS PORTION OF THE GRANT SCOPE REQUIREMENT. WE HAVE REQUESTED THAT THE PORTION OF THE SCOPE NOTED ABOVE BE WAIVED FOR THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS:1.BRILEY PARKWAY INTERCHANGE WITH MURFREESBORO ROAD- THIS LOCATION IS A GRADE SEPARATED INTERCHANGE WITH BRILEY PARKWAY BEING THE OVERHEAD ROUTE. THE INTERSECTION BENEATH THE STRUCTURE IS SIGNALIZED BUT THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE INTERCHANGE CONFIGURATION FOR PEDESTRIANS. BUS STOPS ARE LOCATED AT EACH INTERSECTION ADJACENT TO THE INTERCHANGE WHERE SIDEWALKS END. THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON FOR PEDESTRIANS TO CROSS BENEATH THIS INTERCHANGE TO ACCESS A BUS STOP.2.SMITH SPRINGS ROAD INTERSECTION WITH MURFREESBORO ROAD- THIS INTERSECTION CURRENTLY HAS SIDEWALK INFRASTRUCTURE IN ONE QUADRANT ONLY. THE OTHER 3- QUADRANTS CURRENTLY HAVE GUARDRAIL IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE ROADWAY SHOULDER AND CONTAIN NO ROOM FOR SIDEWALKS. THESE SAME 3- QUADRANTS HAVE VERY STEEP DROP-OFFS BEHIND THE GUARDRAIL MAKING FUTURE SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION COST PROHIBITIVE AND UNLIKELY. CONSTRUCTION OF CROSSINGS HERE APPEAR TO BE WITHOUT PURPOSE AND UNNECESSARILY COSTLY.NEITHER OF THESE INTERSECTIONS IS SERVICED BY HIGH FREQUENCY FEWER STOP TRANSIT SERVICE ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND THE LOCAL BUS SERVICE HAS VERY LOW BOARDINGS AND ALIGHTINGS NEAR THESE LOCATIONS. PICTURES OF BOTH INTERSECTIONS ARE ENCLOSED WITH THIS REQUEST.THE REVISED SCOPE IS AS FOLLOWS:THE PROJECT IS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL MODAL COMPONENTS: INTERSECTION SIGNALIZATION SIDEWALK AND CROSSWALK IMPROVEMENTS; AND BUS SIGNAL PRIORITY SOFTWARE EQUIPMENT AND PASSENGER AMENITIES.THE NASHVILLE MTA AND NASHVILLE METRO PUBLIC WORKS ARE CHANGING THE ROADWAY AND SIGNAL NETWORK BY EMPHASIZING THE ACCOMMODATION OF PEDESTRIANS AND TRANSIT USERS. THIS PROJECT INCLUDES THE INSTALLATION OF BUS PRIORITY EQUIPMENT ON ALL FIXED ROUTE BUSES AND AT ALL SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS ON THE MURFREESBORO ROAD CORRIDOR IN NASHVILLE. THIS PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES FUNDS FOR UPGRADED PASSENGER AMENITIES THROUGHOUT THE MTA SERVICE AREA INCLUDING UPGRADED BUS SHELTERS AND REAL TIME INFORMATION SIGNS ALONG HIGH RIDERSHIP BUS ROUTES AND THE FREE MUSIC CITY CIRCUIT ROUTES.PROVIDING BUS PRIORITY EQUIPMENT ON ALL FIXED ROUTE BUSES WILL ALLOW THE GREATEST FLEXIBILITY IN ASSIGNING BUSES TO THESE ROUTES THUS ASSURING THAT THE BUSES OPERATING ON THESE ROUTES HAVE THE FEATURES NECESSARY TO BEST SERVE THE RIDERS. IN ADDITION NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROLLERS WITH ROBUST BUS PRIORITY FEATURES WILL REPLACE EXISTING 30 YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY CURRENTLY UTILIZED AT THE INTERSECTIONS. HAVING BUS PRIORITY EQUIPMENT ON ALL FIXED ROUTE VEHICLES WILL ALLOW THE EXPANSION OF THIS SYSTEM TO OTHER BUS ROUTES AS TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROLLERS ON THESE ROUTES ARE UPDATED.THIS PROJECT INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS:BUS PRIORITY AT EVERY SIGNAL OUTSIDE THE CBD ON THE MURFREESBORO ROAD TRANSIT ROUTES TO IMPROVE ON TIME PERFORMANCE AND REDUCED TRAVEL TIMES. CONTROL SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND SIGNAL CONTROLLER SELECTION WILL BE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE BUS PRIORITY SYSTEM.NEW CONTROLLERS AND CENTRAL SOFTWARE TO MONITOR SIGNAL PERFORMANCE TO ASSURE THAT BUS PRIORITY IS WORKING AND THAT THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS ARE FULLY OPERATIONAL.NEW SIGNAL EQUIPMENT TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND TO BE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH MUTCD AND ADA. THIS INCLUDES STANDARD PLACEMENT OF SIGNAL AND PEDESTRIAN INDICATIONS 12 LED VEHICULAR INDICATIONS LED PEDESTRIAN COUNTDOWN INDICATIONS PAD MOUNTED CONTROL CABINETS ETC.REPLACEMENT OF NON-SUPPORTED TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROLLERS AND SIGNAL EQUIPMENT THAT HAS EXCEEDED ITS SERVICE LIFE WILL IMPROVE RELIABILITY AND DECREASE SERVICE CALLS AND CONGESTION RELATED TO EQUIPMENT FAILURES.NEW CENTRAL SOFTWARE WILL ALLOW EXPANSION OF BUS PRIORITY MONITORING TO ALL BUS ROUTES IN THE FUTURE.PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS AT ALL BUT TWO OF THE SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE CROSSING TIMES AND INCREASE SAFETY FOR PEDESTRIANS.

IN WATER BIOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE PORT FOR BOTH THE DREDGING AND PIER EXTENSION LOCATIONS THE UNDERWATER AND ABOVE-WATER BIOLOGICAL SURVEYS OF THE DREDGING AREAS AND CHARLIE 1 PIER AND ASSOCIATED FEASIBILITY STUDIES MUST CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL FOR ENDANGERED OR THREATENED SPECIES TO BE 1 AFFECTED BY THE PROJECT AND 2 TO BE BENEFICIALLY AFFECTED THROUGH HABITAT IMPROVEMENT. ADDITIONALLY POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT DESIGNATED FOR WESTERN PACIFIC FISHERIES UNDER THE MAGNUSON STEVENS ACT MUST BE ASSESSED. PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WILL BE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SEAGRASS BEDS NEAR THE PROPOSED DREDGING AREAS OF THE SEAPLANE RAMPS. THIS MAY INFORM RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POTENTIAL COMPENSATORY MITIGATIONS PARTICULARLY FOR DREDGING.  PUBLIC SCOPING: CONDUCT PUBLIC SCOPING TO FULFILL NEPA REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH FUTURE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT BY ENGAGING WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO DISCUSS THEIR CONCERNS IDEAS AND PERSPECTIVES. WILL ENGAGE WITH LOCAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS REQUIRED ESPECIALLY IF OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER ARISE DURING THE FEASIBILITY STAGE. PERMITTING INCLUDING DRAFTING OF A BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT FOR ENDANGERED AND THREATENED SPECIES ON LAND AND IN THE WATER THE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR THE PORT OF SAIPAN WILL INFORM THE PERMITTING PROCESS. THE APPROPRIATE USACE PERMITS MUST BE ACQUIRED FOR THE DREDGING AND CHARLIE 1 DOCK EXTENSION. THE PERMITS MUST INCLUDE NEPA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND OTHER ANALYSES E.G. NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT CLEAN AIR ACT CLEAN WATER ACT AND LOCAL CNMI STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. ADDITIONALLY BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS MUST BE WRITTEN DURING PERMITTING TO FULFILL ESA AND MSA REQUIREMENTS TO ASSESS IMPACTS ON ENDANGERED AND THREATENED SPECIES THEIR CRITICAL HABITAT AND ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT. THE RECIPIENT HAS DISCUSSED THE POTENTIAL PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS WITH THE USACE AND WILL BE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH USACE THROUGHOUT THE PERMITTING PROCESS.  DESIGN OF THE DREDGING AND CHARLIE 1 PIER EXTENSION THE HARBOR IMPROVEMENTS AND DREDGING SPECIFICS MUST BE DESIGNED BY AN ENGINEERING COMPANY.
