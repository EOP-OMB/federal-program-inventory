HOWEVER, TEACHER SHORTAGES ARE AT CRITICALLY HIGH LEVELS IN NORTH DAKOTA. DESPITE THESE TEACHER SHORTAGES, NDDPI IS OPTIMISTIC, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS OFFER AN ACCESSIBLE PATHWAY FOR MORE ASPIRING EDUCATORS TO ENTER THE PROFESSION. NORTH DAKOTA HAS OVER 4,000 PARAPROFESSIONALS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE A PASSION FOR SERVING SPECIAL EDUCATION POPULATIONS, AND MANY OF WHOM ASPIRE TO BECOME CERTIFIED TEACHERS. HOWEVER, SIMPLY DUE TO FINANCIAL BARRIERS OR INFLEXIBLE COURSE DELIVERY SCHEDULES FROM UNIVERSITIES, THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO. WE AIM TO USE THESE GRANT FUNDS TO ELIMINATE THOSE BARRIERS.  2.88M OF THE REQUESTED  3.6M WILL BE AWARDED ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS TO NORTH DAKOTA EDUCATION PREPARATION PROVIDERS (EPPS), WHO WILL SERVE AS RELATED INSTRUCTION PROVIDERS. FOR THE 3-YEAR PERIOD, NDDPI WILL RUN AN ANNUAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, OFFERING 7 TO 13 GRANTS OF  100,000 EACH YEAR, TO WHICH EPPS ACROSS THE STATE CAN RESPOND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN THEIR RESPONSES, EPPS MUST DESCRIBE THEIR INNOVATIVE, HIGH-QUALITY PROGRAM MODELS  WHICH MUST ALIGN TO ALL REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP IN TEACHING REQUIREMENTS  AND STATE HOW MANY CANDIDATES THEY CAN PROVIDE WITH A DEGREE AND LICENSURE WITHIN A  100,000 BUDGET. NDDPI PROJECTS THAT THIS COMPETITIVE PROCESS WILL YIELD DRAMATIC COST SAVINGS ON TYPICAL UNIVERSITY RATES, WHILE FOSTERING MEANINGFUL COLLABORATION BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND BUILDING LOCAL CAPACITY TO DESIGN AND OPERATE HIGH-QUALITY TEACHER APPRENTICESHIP MODELS. AT THE END OF YEAR 3, NDDPI AIMS FOR SAEF COMPETITIVE FUNDS TO HAVE CREATED 6 NEW RAPS AND EXPANDED 6 EXISTING RAPS, ENROLLING MORE THAN 157 APPRENTICES.

HOWEVER, TEACHER SHORTAGES ARE AT CRITICALLY HIGH LEVELS IN NORTH DAKOTA. DESPITE THESE TEACHER SHORTAGES, NDDPI IS OPTIMISTIC, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS OFFER AN ACCESSIBLE PATHWAY FOR MORE ASPIRING EDUCATORS TO ENTER THE PROFESSION. NORTH DAKOTA HAS OVER 4,000 PARAPROFESSIONALS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE A PASSION FOR SERVING SPECIAL EDUCATION POPULATIONS, AND MANY OF WHOM ASPIRE TO BECOME CERTIFIED TEACHERS. HOWEVER, SIMPLY DUE TO FINANCIAL BARRIERS OR INFLEXIBLE COURSE DELIVERY SCHEDULES FROM UNIVERSITIES, THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO. WE AIM TO USE THESE GRANT FUNDS TO ELIMINATE THOSE BARRIERS. NEARLY 60  OF FUNDS FROM THIS BASE AWARD WILL BE USED TO DIRECTLY OFFSET PARTICIPANTS COSTS FROM RELATED INSTRUCTION PROVIDER PROGRAM ACTIVITIES. NDDPI WILL ANNUALLY USE  180,000 TO RUN A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION PROCESS, WHERE UNIVERSITIES BID FOR GRANT FUNDS BASED ON THE QUALITY OF THEIR PROGRAM AND HOW MANY APPRENTICES THEY CAN SUPPORT. BASED ON THIS COMPETITIVE PROCESS, NDDPI PROJECTS DRAMATIC COST SAVINGS ON RELATED INSTRUCTION PROVIDER FEES. AT THE END OF YEAR 5, NDDPI AIMS FOR SAEF GRANT BASE FUNDS TO HAVE CREATED 3 NEW RAPS AND EXPANDED 7 RAPS, WITH 45  TOTAL APPRENTICES.THE REMAINING 40  OF FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WHILE NORTH DAKOTA REGISTERED ITS FIRST APPRENTICESHIP IN TEACHING MODEL IN DECEMBER 2022, IT CURRENTLY LACKS THE ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SCALE SUCH A MODEL STATEWIDE. THE BASE AWARD WOULD BE USED TO (1) PROVIDE SALARIES FOR PERSONNEL AT NDDPI WHO WOULD BE DEDICATED TO ADMINISTERING AND EXPANDING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS, (2) ALLOW STATEWIDE TRAVEL FOR NDDPI LEADERSHIP TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL BUY-IN AND COMPLIANCE TO THE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL, AND (3) SECURE CONTRACTOR SUPPORT TO ENSURE CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN NDDPI AND NORTH DAKOTA UNIVERSITIES, WHO WILL SERVE AS RELATED INSTRUCTION PROVIDERS. AS NDDPI LOOKS TO SCALE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR THE FIRST TIME, SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURING HIGH-QUALITY, LOW-COST PROGRAMS ARE ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL ASPIRING EDUCATORS.SUBRECIPIENT ROLESEDUCATION STANDARDS AND PRACTICES BOARD: SUBAWARD TO ESPB, WHO WILL CONTRACT WITH DR.
