PROJECT DESCRIPTION: THE MAIDEN PASSIVE TREATMENT SYSTEM (MAIDEN PTS) IN DUNKARD TOWNSHIP, GREENE COUNTY WAS ORIGINALLY INSTALLED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY IN 2006 TO ADDRESS TWO ABANDONED MINE DISCHARGES INCLUDING ONE OF THE LARGEST SOURCES OF ACIDIC AMD IN THE DUNKARD CREEK WATERSHED. THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED AS PART OF A VAST PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP EFFORT TO RESTORE DUNKARD CREEK WHICH WAS BEING IMPACTED BY OLD, ABANDONED COAL MINES. THIS PARTNERSHIP INCLUDED WATERSHED AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, PRIVATE COMPANIES AND LOCAL CITIZENS. ABOUT ONE YEAR AFTER COMPLETION, THE LANDOWNER REVOKED ALL PERMISSIONS TO ENTER THE PROPERTY WHICH PREVENTED MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM. STREAM RESTORATION INCORPORATED AND VARIOUS PROJECT PARTNERS SPENT SEVERAL YEARS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ATTEMPTING TO A NEW AGREEMENT AND AT ONE POINT EVEN TRIED TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY WITHOUT SUCCESS. THE TREATMENT SYSTEM WAS THOUGHT TO BE LOST. THEN IN 2015, MEPCO, LLC SPECIFICALLY PURCHASED THE PROPERTY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING SRI ACCESS TO OPERATE, MAINTAIN, MONITOR, REHABILITATE AND IMPROVE THE MAIDEN PTS. AFTER ALMOST 10 YEARS OF TREATING HIGHLY ACIDIC AND METAL LADEN WATER WITH NO MAINTENANCE, THE SYSTEM WAS FOUND TO BE IN VERY POOR CONDITION. THE AMD WAS ESSENTIALLY BYPASSING MOST OF THE TREATMENT COMPONENTS. FUNDING WAS PULLED TOGETHER FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES TO RESTORE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE EXISTING COMPONENTS AS FEASIBLE. THIS INITIAL PHASE WAS COMPLETED IN 2016. WHILE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN WATER QUALITY WERE ACHIEVED, ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED INCLUDING EXPANDING EXISTING TREATMENT CAPABILITY. WORK TO BE COMPLETED INCLUDES CLEANING OF LIMESTONE, ADDING ADDITIONAL TREATMENT MEDIA, AND CONVERTING THE EXISTING HORIZONTAL FLOW LIMESTONE BED TO A MIXED MEDIA JENNINGSSTYLE VERTICAL FLOW POND. COMBINED WITH THE EFFORTS OF MEPCO, LLC THESE PROPOSED EFFORTS ARE EXPECTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE DUNKARD CREEK. ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS: THIS PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO REHABILITATE THE MAIDEN PASSIVE TREATMENT SYSTEM. ONCE COMPLETED THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO TREAT AN ESTIMATED 150 MILLION GALLONS OF AMD PER YEAR RESULTING IN THE NEUTRALIZATION OF MORE THAN 100,000 LB YEAR OF ACIDITY AND THE PREVENTION OF MORE THAN 25,000 LB YEAR OF IRON AND 20,000 LB YEAR OF ALUMINUM FROM ENTERING DUNKARD CREEK.

WATER MONITORING OF LAUREL RUN HAS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN WATER QUALITY DUE TO THE TWO PASSIVE SYSTEMS. WHILE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO PROLONG THE LIFE OF THE 20-YEAR-OLD SYSTEM THROUGH STIRRING OF THE EXISTING TREATMENT MEDIA AND PERFORMANCE OF OTHER MAINTENANCE IN THE SHORT-TERM, BASED ON THE EXISTING DESIGN AND PAST MAINTENANCE ISSUES, THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IS TO REHABILITATE THE SYSTEM AND POTENTIALLY IMPROVE THE DESIGN BASED ON THE MOST RECENT UNDERSTANDING OF PASSIVE TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE SYSTEM CAN LIKELY BE EXPANDED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DISCHARGE TO BE TREATED WITH LESS FREQUENT EPISODES OF UNTREATED WATER REACHING THE STREAM. THIS PROJECT WILL DESIGN, PERMIT, AND REHABILITATE/EXPAND THE LAUREL RUN #1 PASSIVE TREATMENT SYSTEM. CONSTRUCTION WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON RECONFIGURING TWO OF THE EXISTING VERTICAL FLOW PONDS AND EXPANDING A THIRD. NEW PIPING AND TREATMENT MEDIA WILL BE INSTALLED.EXPECTED DELIVERABLES OR OUTCOMES: THIS PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO REHABILITATE THE LAUREL RUN #1 PASSIVE TREATMENT SYSTEM. ONCE COMPLETED THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO TREAT AN ESTIMATED 55 MILLION GALLONS OF AMD PER YEAR RESULTING IN THE NEUTRALIZATION OF OVER 50,000 LB/YEAR OF ACIDITY AND THE PREVENTION OF ABOUT 3,000 LB/YEAR OF IRON AND 4,000 LB/YEAR OF ALUMINUM FROM ENTERING LAUREL RUN, WHICH IS IDENTIFIED AS AN IMPAIRED STREAM ON THE PENNSYLVANIA INTEGRATED WATERS REPORT. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: RESTORING THE TREATMENT SYSTEM WILL HELP TO MAINTAIN THE IMPROVEMENT GAINS TO THE WATER QUALITY AND AQUATIC LIFE IN LAUREL RUN.

THE TREATMENT SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED IN THE EARLY 90'S BY DEP, RESULTING IN THE ELIMINATION OF 23 TONS/YEAR OF IRON BEING DISCHARGED INTO CROOKED CREEK. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THE PASSIVE TREATMENT SYSTEM HAS BECOME INEFFECTIVE DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO GENERATE ENOUGH IRON OXIDATION IN THE FIRST SETTLING POND. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CONSTRUCT STRUCTURES WITHIN THE SYSTEM'S FOOTPRINT TO ALLOW A SHALLOW SHEET FLOW OF THE INFLUENT INTO THE FIRST POND. THIS WILL INCREASE THE OXIDATION AND GAS EXCHANGE AND ASSURE MORE RAPID IRON OXIDATION. IN ADDITION, THE PROJECT HOPES TO DECREASE THE SPEED OF THE WATER FLOW TO OBTAIN MAXIMUM SOLIDS PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE USE OF ADDITIONAL BAFFLE CURTAINS IN THE FIRST TWO PONDS. THE PROJECT MAY ALSO FIND THAT DREDGING A PORTION OF THE EXISTING IRON FROM THE INITIAL SETTLING PONDS WILL BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE THE RETENTION TIME.EXPECTED DELIVERABLES OR OUTCOMES: THIS PROJECT'S GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE WATER DISCHARGING FROM THE TANOMA PASSIVE TREATMENT SYSTEM AS IT ENTERS CROOKED CREEK, ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN THE PLANTS IN THE WETLANDS HAVE DIED AND INFLUENT WATER FLOW IS GREATER. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THE DECREASED IRON CONCENTRATION IN CROOKED CREEK WILL BE A BENEFIT TO THE INDIANA COUNTY MUNICIPAL SERVICES AUTHORITY'S CROOKED CREEK PLANT THAT MAINTAINS A DRINKING WATER INTAKE APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES DOWNSTREAM.

MARYS, ELK COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA TITLED: WEST CREEK AMD TREATMENT SYSTEM INSTALLATION. THE TREATMENT SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO TREAT FOUR MINE DISCHARGE SITES. THE SYSTEM IS SPATIALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO DISTINCT TREATMENT AREAS BASED ON THE LOCATIONS OF THE ACID MINE DRAINAGE DISCHARGE SOURCES. TREATMENT AREA 1 IS THE LARGER OF THE TWO AREAS AND TREATS THREE DISCHARGES. TREATMENT AREA 1 IS DESIGNED TO USE A TERRACED IRON FORMATION (TIFF) AND A JENNINGS- STYLE VERTICAL FLOW POND (JVFP), WHICH HAS A 20 YEAR- DESIGN LIFE. THE TIFF PROVIDES A LOW- COST TREATMENT THAT WILL HELP TO PROLONG THE LIFE OF THE JVFP THROUGH THE PRECIPITATION OF A PORTION OF THE IRON BEFORE IT REACHES THE FIRST ALKALINITY GENERATING COMPONENT. THIS HELPS TO PRESERVE THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY AND LONG- TERM FUNCTIONALITY OF THE JVFP TREATMENT MEDIA. TREATMENT AREA 2 IS DESIGNED TO TREAT ONE DISCHARGE USING AN ANOXIC LIMESTONE DRAIN, WHICH HAS A LIFETIME OF 20 YEARS.EXPECTED DELIVERABLES OR OUTCOMES: TREATMENT AREA 1 (DISCHARGES WC2, WC3, WC4): INSTALLATION OF A TERRACED IRON FORMATION (TIFF) WHICH SERVES AS A COLLECTION CHANNEL TO CAPTURE THE DIFFUSE SEEP ZONE, AND PROVIDES A MEANS FOR LOW-PH IRON REMOVAL TO OCCUR PRIOR TO TREATMENT IN THE SUBSEQUENT PRIMARY ALKALINITY GENERATING TREATMENT COMPONENT, WHICH IS THE JENNINGS STYLE VERTICAL FLOW POND (JVFP).
