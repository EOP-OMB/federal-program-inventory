PROGRESS ON LOCALIZING THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A PUBLIC RESOURCE IS LIMITED BY A LACK  OF NATIVE CAPACITY TO ANALYZE AND USE SUCH DATA. WITH THIS IN MIND, WE CREATED YOUTHMAPPERS TO \u00bfNOT JUST  BUILD MAPS, BUT BUILD MAPPERS.\u00bf BY EMBEDDING VOLUNTEER DATA CREATION WITHIN THE ACADEMIC SECTOR, WHICH  PRODUCES THE NEXT GENERATION WORKFORCE, AND LINKING THE DATA DIRECTLY TO END-USERS IN THE HUMANITARIAN AND  DEVELOPMENT SECTOR, WE INSTILL TECHNICAL SKILLS, AND REINFORCE CAREER ASPIRATIONS TO IMPROVE LIVES IN LMIC.  OUR OBJECTIVES ALIGN WITH THE GOALS OF USAID TO ACCELERATE LMIC CAPACITY FOR HIGH-LEVEL SCIENCE,  TECHNOLOGY, PARTNERSHIP SUPPORT, AND INNOVATION BY: (1) SUPPORTING YOUTHMAPPERS TO CREATE FOUNDATIONAL  QUALITY GEOSPATIAL DATA IN UNDERMAPPED PLACES WHERE USAID HAS A PRESENCE, MAKING IT AVAILABLE AS A  PUBLIC GOOD, WHERE IT CAN BE USED FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE APPLICATIONS; (2)  BUILDING CAPACITY AMONG YOUTHMAPPERS TO CREATE THEIR OWN LOCAL PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT, IMPROVED COMMUNITIES, AND GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT  AND WORKFORCE-ENHANCING OPPORTUNITIES; AND (3) PROVIDING THE LEADERSHIP AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO  GROW AND MANAGE AN INCLUSIVE AND EMPOWERING NETWORK. THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WILL FOCUS ON THE  MOST SUCCESSFUL IMPACTS AND A GAPS ASSESSMENT FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT PHASE OF YOUTHMAPPERS AND RELATE  TO SCALING UP DATA PRODUCTION & QUALITY; OFFERING MEANINGFUL LEADERSHIP AND CAPACITY BUILDING; AND  STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AZ", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "18ebe923-151d-7095-dfea-7767365ba71d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_7200AA18CA00015_7200"}, {"internal_id": 71187747, "Award ID": "7200AA18CA00009", "Award Amount": 51903541.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-08-02", "CFDA Number": "98.001", "Description": "THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID), THROUGH THE CENTER FOR DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH (CDR) IN THE U.S. GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT LAB (LAB) PLANS TO INVEST IN A FIVE-YEAR COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH A HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION (HEI)  TO SUPPORT A PROJECT ENTITLED LONG-TERM  ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES FOR RESEARCH  (LASER).
