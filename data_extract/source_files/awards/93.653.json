IGNACE INDIAN HEALTH CENTER FORENSIC SERVICES PROGRAM - THE GERALD L. IGNACE INDIAN HEALTH CENTER (GLIIHC), WISCONSIN\u2019S ONLY URBAN INDIAN HEALTH CENTER, IS LOCATED JUST SOUTH OF DOWNTOWN MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN, WHICH HAS A POPULATION OF 595,351 (2017, EST.). GLIIHC IS LOCATED IN THE URBAN COMMUNITY WHERE MOST AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVES (AI/AN) WHO LIVE IN THE AREA RESIDE. IT IS THE ONLY URBAN INDIAN HEALTH CENTER IN WISCONSIN. SADLY, MILWAUKEE IS KNOWN NATIONALLY FOR BEING A HUB FOR SEX TRAFFICKING. IT\u2019S EVEN EARNED TWO NOTORIOUS NICKNAMES AS THE \u201cMECCA FOR SEX TRAFFICKING\u201d AND THE \u201cHARVARD OF PIMP SCHOOL.\u201d  EXPERTS HAVE THEORIZED THAT SEVERAL THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS, NAMELY THAT THERE ARE EXPRESSWAYS THAT CONNECT CHICAGO, MINNEAPOLIS, THE WISCONSIN DELLS, AND NORTH DAKOTA (DUE TO THE FRACKING INDUSTRY). THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF CONVENTIONS AND SPORTING EVENTS THAT TAKE PLACE EVERY YEAR IN MILWAUKEE. IT\u2019S GEOGRAPHICALLY CENTRAL, IT\u2019S POOR, AND IT\u2019S NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE COLLAPSE OF THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY THAT ONCE SUPPORTED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CITY RESIDENTS. A REPORT BY THE MILWAUKEE HOMICIDE REVIEW COMMISSION (2016) FOUND THAT 340 INDIVIDUALS AGES 25 AND UNDER WERE CONFIRMED OR WERE BELIEVED TO BE VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2013 AND DECEMBER 31, 2016 IN MILWAUKEE. THEY WERE: OVERWHELMINGLY FEMALE (97%), YOUNG (55% WERE UNDER AGE 18), AND OFTEN HAD A HISTORY OF HAVING BEEN REPORTED MISSING. OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN REPORTED MISSING, 59% WERE REPORTED FROM OUT-OF-HOME CARE (E.G. FOSTER CARE OR GROUP HOMES). THEY FREQUENTLY BECAME TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AT VERY YOUNG AGES, TOO. SEE THE FOLLOWING TABLE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THOUGH AI/AN MAKE UP JUST 1% OF THE STATEWIDE POPULATION, THEY MAKE UP 2% OF THE POPULATION OF MILWAUKEE, AND THEY MADE UP 4.7% OF THE STATEWIDE ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING IN THE DATES TRACKED BETWEEN 2017-2018 (REPORTS OF CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING ALLEGATIONS & SUBSTANTIATIONS TO CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES, WI DEPT. OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES, DECEMBER 2018).  THUS, AI/AN CHILDREN WERE REPRESENTED IN THIS TOTAL AT NEARLY FIVE TIMES THE RATE OF THEIR REPRESENTATION IN THE OVERALL POPULATION.  AS MANY TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ARE OVER THE AGE OF 18, THIS IS ONLY PART OF THE PICTURE. THE WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, BUREAU OF JUSTICE INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS REPORTED THAT AI/AN PATIENTS HAVE A 240% HIGHER RATE OF VISITS TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS (2018).  LOCALLY, RATES OF SEXUAL VICTIMIZATION OF AI/AN PEOPLE ARE LIKELY UNDERREPORTED. ADVOCATES AND CLINICIANS KNOW THAT MANY SURVIVORS MAY OPT NOT TO REPORT, OR MAY BE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING AND THEREFORE HAVE NO WAY TO MAKE REPORTS. THE GERALD L. IGNACE INDIAN HEALTH CENTER FORENSIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES PROGRAM WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING GOALS: GOAL 1: STRENGTHEN OR INCREASE ACCESS TO QUALITY MEDICAL FORENSIC HEALTHCARE TO VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE INCLUDING CHILDREN.

GOAL 3: PROMOTE EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES. GOAL 4: INTEGRATE AT LEAST ONE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION THAT IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE, OR KNOWN AS A PROMISING PRACTICE, AND MAY BE INTEGRATED OR COORDINATED WITH TRADITIONAL PRACTICES AND/OR FAITH-BASED SERVICES TO FACILITATE THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING OF VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

THE COMMUNITY IS LOCATED ON UNCEDED TLINGIT ANI LAND AND HAS BEEN INHABITED BY THE TLINGIT PEOPLE SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. APPROXIMATELY ONE QUARTER OF WRANGELL RESIDENTS ARE ALASKA NATIVE.  TO DATE, WRANGELL HAS NEVER HAD SUSTAINED EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE HOUSED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE LIMITED RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE, LOW AWARENESS OF THE SCOPE OF THE ISSUE IN THE COMMUNITY AND LIMITED TO NO COLLABORATION BETWEEN SERVICE PARTNERS WHO ARE PROVIDING SERVICES AND INTERACTING WITH VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL ADDRESS THIS GAP IN SYSTEMATICALLY RESPONDING TO AND PREVENTING INTER-PERSONAL VIOLENCE INCLUDING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE, SEXUAL VIOLENCE, TEEN DATING VIOLENCE, AND CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT BY ESTABLISHING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL 1. FUND A FULL-TIME VIOLENCE PREVENTION SPECIALIST (VPS) FOR WRANGELL COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION; 2. EXPAND OR ESTABLISH A COORDINATED COMMUNITY RESPONSE (CCR)/DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TASK FORCE THROUGH COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT FROM THE WCA VPS; 3. EXPAND VIOLENCE PREVENTION TRAINING AND EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF IN THE WRANGELL SCHOOL DISTRICT THROUGH THE PROVISION OF ALASKA SAFE CHILDREN\u2019S ACT COMPLIANT PRESENTATIONS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIMARY PREVENTION PROGRAMS; 4. PROVIDE COMMUNITY-BASED TRAINING TO ALLIED PROFESSIONALS; 5. EXPAND OUTREACH ABOUT VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION SERVICES; AND 6. INCREASE REFERRALS TO EXISTING PROGRAMS PROVIDING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE.  WCA WILL WORK WITH LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND STATEWIDE PARTNERS TO SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCH DEDICATED SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. DURING THE FIRST YEAR, EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON COMPLETING A NEEDS ASSESSMENT, HIRING A VIOLENCE PREVENTION SPECIALIST, AND CONVENING A DEDICATED CCR TO BEGIN ALIGNING EFFORTS AND DEVELOPING A COORDINATED EFFORT TO PROVIDE REFERRALS AND SUPPORTS TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. WCA WILL RECEIVE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM THE ALASKA NATIVE WOMEN\u2019S RESOURCE CENTER (AKNWRC), WOMEN IN SAFE HOMES (WISH), ALASKA NETWORK ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT (ANDVSA) AND OTHERS TO ASSURE EFFORTS ARE COMPREHENSIVE AND ALIGN WITH BEST PRACTICES TO SUPPORT ALASKA NATIVE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE.  WCA HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE MANAGING EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS EXPERIENCE WILL SUPPORT THEIR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, AND SUSTAINABILITY OF A DVP PROGRAM FOR WRANGELL.
