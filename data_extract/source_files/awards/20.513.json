THIS VEHICLE IN PARTICULAR IS USED AS ONE OF OUR TWO REGULAR BUSES THAT PICK UP AND DELIVER SENIORS TO THE CATOOSA COUNTY SENIOR CENTER AS WELL AS BEING USED FOR NORMAL TRANSIT TRIPS. THE RETIREMENT OF OUR CURRENT COUNTY PURCHASED BUS WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT WOULD RESULT IN THE REDUCTION OF ONE EIGHTH OF OUR TRANSIT FLEET WITH AN ASSOCIATED DROP IN TRIP CAPACITY. 2. SETAAAD VOLUNTEER DRIVER PROGRAM: THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL PRIORITIZE AND IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL NEEDED SERVICES AREAS. ADDITIONALLY 200 MEMBERSHIP VOUCHERS AT $25 AND 1000 ROUND TRIP RIDE VOUCHERS AT $5 WILL BE AVAILABLE TO VERY LOW-INCOME OLDER ADULTS IN HAMILTON COUNTY. 3.

BECAUSE OUR CURRENT LEVEL IS ZERO DUE TO LACK OF ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES A PERCENTAGE OF INCREASE CANNOT BE REPORTED. STRATEGY 1: WORKING WITH PARTNERS WHO SERVE INDIVIDUALS/FAMILIES WITH DISABILITIES WE WILL COMMUNICATE THE NEW OFFERINGS. FOR EXAMPLE FEDERALLY CITED ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT 20% OF PUBLIC HOUSING FAMILIES CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE MEMBER WHO IS CLASSIFIED AS HAVING A DISABILITY. THE SCENARIO IS SIMILAR TO THE POPULATIONS THAT OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS SERVE. OUR INTENTION IS TO ADDRESS HISTORIC UNMET NEEDS. DESIRED OUTCOME 2: INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIOR RESIDENTS TO ACCESS ESSENTIAL SERVICES/PRODUCTS THROUGH AVAILABLE ROUTINE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS AT AN AVERAGE OF 20-ONE WAY TRIPS PER WEEK. STRATEGY 2: CURRENT TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS ARE ON AN ON-CALL BASIS AND IS OPEN TO ALL RESIDENTS. BY CREATING A RELIABLE SCHEDULE WITH MARKETING TO THOSE WHO ARE THE PRIORITY POPULATION WITH VEHICLES EQUIPPED TO MEET RIDERS NEEDS WE KNOW THAT WE WILL BETTER ADDRESS THE HISTORIC UNMET NEED. DESIRED OUTCOME 3: FILL TRANSPORTATION GAPS WHERE SERVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

PURPOSE OF AWARDTHE KNOXVILLE REGIONAL HUMAN SERVICES TRANSPORTATION COORDINATION PLAN IDENTIFIED SEVERAL GAPS IN SERVICES IN THE KNOXVILLE URBAN AREA. MANY OF THESE GAPS DEALT WITH THE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY. THERE ARE TIMES AND/OR LOCATIONS WITHIN THE URBAN AREA THAT THE FIXED-ROUTE MASS-TRANSIT SERVICE AND THE REQUIRED ADA COMPLIMENTARY PARATRANSIT DOES NOT SERVE. IN FACT GEOGRAPHICALLY THE MASS-TRANSIT SERVICE AND THE REQUIRED ADA COMPLIMENTARY PARATRANSIT SERVICE COVER APPROXIMATELY 25-30% OF THE URBAN AREA.

THEREFORE THE HUMAN SERVICES TRANSPORTATION COORDINATION PLAN LIST AS STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND GAPS IN SERVICES WITH THE USE OF SECTION 5310 FUNDING. THIS INCLUDES HELPING TO PROVIDE EXPANDED SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE URBAN AREA. ONE WAY THE PLAN RECOMMENDS ACCOMPLISHING THIS IS TO PROVIDE SECTION 5310 CAPITAL FUNDING TO NON-PROFITS AND HUMAN RESOURCES SERVICE AGENCIES TO PURCHASE VANS AND MINI-BUSES. ANOTHER STRATEGY IS THE USE OF MOBILITY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES TO EXPAND MORE TRANSIT OPTIONS AND TO BETTER COORDINATE THE EXISTING SERVICES. A FINAL STRATEGY IS TO USE SECTION 5310 OPERATING FUNDING FOR VOLUNTEER ASSISTED TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AND EXPANDED DEMAND RESPONSE TRANSIT SERVICES. THE BENEFIT OF DOING THESE STRATEGIES ARE MORE SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS WHICH PROVIDES THEM THE FREEDOM TO TRAVEL TO TAKE JOBS AND TO PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AWARD IS TO PROVIDE GRANT FUNDS TO SUB-RECIPIENTS TO IMPLEMENT BOTH CAPITAL AND OPERATING PROJECTS TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO SENIORS AND PERSONS WHO ARE DISABLED IN THE KNOXVILLE URBAN AREA.2.

THIS PROGRAM SEEKS TO FILL GAPS WHERE SERVICE IS NOT PROVIDED. THE RATIONALE OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT THERE ARE TRANSPORTATION NEEDS TO CERTAIN AREAS AND ON CERTAIN DAYS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET AND TAXI SERVICE CAN FILL THE GAPS.5310 SUBRECIPIENTS:1)CITY OF OLATHE TAXI COUPON/VOUCHER PROGRAM ($525000/FED) OPERATING ASSISTANCETHE CITY PROVIDES A DOOR-TO-DOOR DEMAND RESPONSE TRANSPORTATION SERVICE TO OLATHE SENIOR AND DISABLED CITIZENS. THIS IS THE ONLY LICENSED DEMAND RESPONSE SERVICE IN OLATHE THAT CAN BE ACCESSED 24 HOURS PER DAY 7 DAYS A WEEK. THE CITY OF OLATHE TAXI COUPON/VOUCHER PROGRAM CONTRACTS SERVICES WITH A LOCAL TAXI COMPANY TO PROVIDE SENIORS AND DISABLED CITIZENS AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION TO PERSONAL MEDICAL AND WORK DESTINATIONS. 2)CITY OF OLATHE GROUP TRIP ($25000/FED) OPERATING ASSISTANCETHE CITY PROVIDES A DOOR-TO-DOOR DEMAND RESPONSE TRANSPORTATION SERVICE TO OLATHE SENIOR AND DISABLED CITIZENS. THIS IS THE ONLY LICENSED DEMAND RESPONSE SERVICE IN OLATHE THAT CAN BE ACCESSED 24 HOURS PER DAY 7 DAYS A WEEK. THIS PROJECT WOULD EXPAND THE TAXI-CAB COUPON SERVICE TO INCLUDE GROUP TRIPS. THE SERVICE WOULD BE CONTRACTED OUT TO A LOCAL TAXI COMPANY(S) TO PROVIDE GROUP TRIPS TO OUR SENIORS AND DISABLED CITIZENS.3)CITY OF SHAWNEE/CITYRIDE EXPANSION ($24000/FED) OPERATING ASSISTANCECITYRIDE IS A COMMUNITY BASED DOOR-TO-DOOR TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM CURRENTLY FUNDED BY THE CITY OF SHAWNEE KANSAS. ITS PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE BETTER TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS TO SENIOR CITIZENS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WHO RESIDE IN THE CITY. MANY ELDERLY AND DISABLED PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE JO SERVICE OPERATED BY JOHNSON COUNTY TRANSIT OR ANY OTHER TRANSIT ON A REGULAR OR CONSISTENT BASIS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE JO LOCATED IN OLATHE KANSAS ONLY SERVES A SMALL PORTION OF THE CITY (TWO COMMUTER BUS LINES). CITYRIDE SERVES THE NEEDS OF THE UNSERVED/UNDERSERVED BY PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE TRANSIT OPTIONS FOR ELIGIBLE SENIOR CITIZENS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES SO THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND MOBILITY. THE CITY IS SEEKING TO EXPAND RIDERSHIP OF THE CITYRIDE SO THAT MORE ELIGIBLE RIDERS CAN USE THE SERVICE.THE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO OPERATE THE EXISTING SERVICE. THE CITY PLANS TO MORE ACTIVELY PROMOTE THE SERVICE TO ELIGIBLE RIDERS TO GROW THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE USING THE SERVICE. THE CITY CHANGED THE RIDER ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM AGE FOR ELIGIBILITY FROM AGE 62 TO 65. THE CITY ALSO ADDED THE JO TRANSIT CENTER AS A LOCATION OUTSIDE OF THE CITY LIMITS SO THAT RIDERS CAN GET TO IT WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL COST TO THEM. THIS ADDS MORE TRANSIT OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY CAN GET TO THE BUS SYSTEM MORE EASILY. THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THE CITYRIDE EXPANSION PROJECT IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE SENIOR CITIZENS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WHO USE THE SERVICE. THE EXPECTED OUTCOME IS THAT AN ADDITIONAL 154 RIDERS WILL BEGIN USING THE PROGRAM OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. UNDER THE SECTION 5310 PROGRAM 55% OF THE FUNDS SHOULD BE APPLIED TO TRADITIONAL SECTION 5310 PROJECTS. THOSE PROJECTS ARE LISTED BELLOWS:55% TRADITIONAL PROJECTSKCATA - MOBILITY MANAGEMENT/TRAVEL TRAINING PROGRAM ($511648/FED) THIS PROJECT WILL TRAIN PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIORS ( 65 YEARS AND UP) ON HOW TO ACCESS ANY OF THE FOUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN THE FIVE COUNTY SERVICE AREA OF JACKSON CLAY PLATTE JOHNSON AND WYANDOTTE COUNTIES AND ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL ELIGIBILITY PROCESS FOR PARATRANSIT SERVICES.
