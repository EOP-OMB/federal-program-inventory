ESTIMATES FROM THE 2018 SURVEILLANCE YEAR, WHICH INCLUDED DATA FROM OUR MARYLAND ADDM SITE, SHOWED 1 IN 44 8-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN HAD ASD. THERE WERE ALSO SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN ASD IDENTIFICATION BY RACE, ETHNICITY, AND CO-OCCURRING INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. THE DISABILITIES EXPERIENCES BY PEOPLE WITH ASD LEAD TO LIFE-LONG HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND INTER-PERSONAL CHALLENGES. EARLIER IDENTIFICATION OF ASD IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED OUTCOMES. THERE IS MUCH DEBATE IN THE FIELD OVER WHETHER THIS DRAMATIC INCREASE REPRESENTS AN INCREASE IN RISK FACTORS OR AN INCREASE IN AWARENESS AND CHANGES TO DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA OVER THAT TIME-PERIOD, WITH EVIDENCE SUGGESTING IT LIKELY IS DUE TO BOTH. REGARDLESS OF THE UNDERLYING REASON, RELIABLE ESTIMATES ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING ASD, AT VARIOUS LIFE STAGES, AND A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE WITH ASD ARE NEEDED TO INFORM RISK FACTOR RESEARCH, PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE, AND CLINICAL/SERVICE PROVIDER RESOURCE PLANNING INITIATIVES.  TO ADDRESS THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE AND MEET THE NEEDS OF STAKEHOLDER GROUPS, THE MARYLAND ADDM (MD-ADDM) TEAM PLANS TO CONTINUE OUR LONG-STANDING PRODUCTIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES MONITORING (ADDM) NETWORK. WE WILL PROVIDE ONGOING REPORTS OF HIGH-QUALITY DATA ON THE PREVALENCE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ASD IN MARYLAND TO INFORM THE ADDM ESTIMATE. WE PLAN TO IMPLEMENT 4 STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT THIS WORK: (1) COMPONENT A: PERFORM ASD SURVEILLANCE AMONG 4- AND 8-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN LIVING IN 5 SUBURBAN MARYLAND COUNTIES, (2) COMPONENT B: PERFORM NEW ASD SURVEILLANCE AMONG 16-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN LIVING IN THE SAME 5 COUNTIES USING EXISTING ADDM METHODOLOGY, (3) LEVERAGE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS AND EXPLORE NEW RELATIONSHIPS FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION OF ADDM FINDINGS, PROVIDING COMMUNITY DATA FOR ACTION, AND (4) ENSURE HIGH DATA QUALITY, VALIDITY, AND RELIABILITY THROUGH FREQUENT MONITORING AND EVALUATION WITH MEASURABLE METRICS AND APPLICATION OF RIGOROUS STANDARDIZED METHODS DEVELOPED BY THE ADDM NETWORK. THIS WILL ENABLE RELIABLE ESTIMATION OF ASD PREVALENCE IN 2022 AND 2024, ASSESSMENT OF DIFFERENCES BY DEMOGRAPHIC AND OTHER HEALTH CHARACTERISTICS, AND COMPARISON OF TRENDS ACROSS DEVELOPMENTAL AGES AND CALENDAR TIME. COMPREHENSIVE DATA WILL BE PROVIDED THROUGH ABSTRACTION OF DATA FROM MULTIPLE ASD DATA SOURCES IN MARYLAND, INCLUDING EDUCATION AND HEALTH RECORDS. A PARTICULAR STRENGTH OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE ABILITY TO PERFORM CROSS-SECTIONAL COMPARISONS ACROSS DEVELOPMENTAL AGES BY SURVEILLING 3 AGE GROUPS LIVING IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES AT THE SAME TIME, AND TEMPORAL COMPARISONS, POSSIBLE BECAUSE MARYLAND HAS CONTRIBUTED PREVALENCE ESTIMATE AND ASD CHARACTERISTIC DATA TO THE ADDM NETWORK FOR THE SAME COMMUNITIES OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS.

USING A SURVEILLANCE REGION DEFINED WITHIN SAN DIEGO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA JOINED THE ADDM NETWORK FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THE PREVIOUS FUNDING CYCLE, WHERE HIGHER ASD PREVALENCE RATES WERE FOUND IN US CHILDREN THAN ANY PREVIOUS SURVEILLANCE PERIOD. SPECIFICALLY, OUR CALIFORNIA ADDM SITE (CA ADDM) HAD THE HIGHEST PREVALENCE FOR BOTH 4- AND 8-YEAR-OLDS, THE LOWEST AGE OF DIAGNOSIS, THE LOWEST PROPORTION OF CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY (ID), AND ONE OF THE MORE RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATIONS. THIS, IN TURN, LED TO THE OVERALL POPULATION OF THE ADDM NETWORK BEING MORE RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS (MAENNER ET AL., 2021; SHAW ET AL., 2021). AS UNDERSCORED BY 14 MOUS/LOSS, IN THE CURRENT APPLICATION OUR TEAM AT THE UCSD AUTISM CENTER OF EXCELLENCE PROPOSES TO FURTHER DEVELOP POPULATION-BASED, MULTIPLE-SOURCE, SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS FOR ASD WITHIN THIS UNIQUE REGION.

UNDERSCORING THE SUCCESS OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN ADDM, ALL PARTNERS FROM THE PREVIOUS ROUND OF FUNDING HAVE ENTHUSIASTICALLY AGREED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE MISSION OF THE ADDM NETWORK.

SRINIVASA NALABOLU WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL DURING THE PREVIOUS ROUND OF FUNDING WITH HIGH QAQC METRICS OFTEN EXCEEDING 94% RELIABILITY WITH THE PC, AND DELIVERY OF CLEAN, BIRTH CERTIFICATE LINKED DATA TO THE CDC OFTEN AHEAD OF DEADLINES.

MOREOVER, WE OFTEN WORKED COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE CDC TO FIELD TEST AND TROUBLESHOOT TECHNICAL AND LOGISTICAL OPERATIONS VITAL TO THE ENTIRE ADDM NETWORK. USING ADDM METHODOLOGY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS A RANGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AS THEY RELATE TO ASD INCLUDING DETERMINING: (1) PREVALENCE RATES WITHIN A DESIGNATED SURVEILLANCE AREA DEFINED BY FIPS CODES THAT INCLUDES FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONTAINING MORE THAN 15,000 CHILDREN IN BOTH THE FOUR-YEAR AND EIGHT-YEAR OLD COHORTS (WITH A HIGH LIKELIHOOD FOR ADDITIONAL EXPANSION); (2) DIFFERENCES IN PREVALENCE AMONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS; (3) INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING; (4), AND AGE AT FIRST DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION.
