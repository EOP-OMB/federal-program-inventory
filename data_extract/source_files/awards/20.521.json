LACK OF ADEQUATE TRANSPORTATION IS A PRIMARY BARRIER TO WORK FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. THE 2000 CENSUS SHOWED THAT ONLY 60 PERCENT OF PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 16 AND 64 WITH DISABILITIES ARE EMPLOYED. THE NEW FREEDOM FORMULA GRANT PROGRAM SEEKS TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND EXPAND THE TRANSPORTATION MOBILITY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BEYOND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ADA ACT OF 1990.PROJECTS FUNDED UNDER THIS APPLICATION INCLUDE FUNDING TO THE DESIGNATED RECIPIENT (JTA) FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS (UP TO 10%) FOR UPDATES TO THE NORTHEAST FLORIDA COORDINATED MOBILITY PLAN GRANT AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT OF JTA AND SUB-RECIPIENT PROJECTS; AND ONE PROJECT THAT WAS AWARDED BY THE NORTHEAST FLORIDA MOBILITY COALITION COMPETITIVE SELECTION COMMITTEE TO THE JTA FOR A TRAVEL TRAINING PROGRAM.THE TRAVEL TRAINING PROGRAM PROJECT THAT WAS AWARDED FUNDING TO THE DESIGNATED RECIPIENT (JTA) WILL IMPACT THE ENTIRE FIVE COUNTY REGION AS WELL AS VOLUSIA AND FLAGLER COUNTIES AS THE JTA IS PARTNERING WITH ELDER SOURCE WHICH SERVES THE ENTIRE REGION.THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE TRAVEL TRAINING PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES SENIOR ADULTS AND PERSONS OF LOW INCOME TO USE LOWER COST TRIP OPTIONS. THE PROGRAM WILL BEGIN WITH TRAIN-THE-TRAINER TO PROVIDE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EASTER SEALS PROJECT ACTION MODELS AND PROCEDURES TO THOSE WHO WILL PROVIDE DIRECT TRAINING TO INDIVIDUALS. IN THIS MANNER THE TRAINING ALSO PROVIDES RIDER AND PROVIDER UNDERSTANDING OF TRANSPORTATION SERVICE OPTIONS AVAILABLE. TRAINING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIORS TO USE FIXED ROUTE BUS SERVICE WILL PROVIDE EACH INDIVIDUAL WITH THE KNOWLEDGE TO GAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE. THIS TRAINING WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO USE THE ACCOMMODATIONS PROVIDED THROUGH FIXED ROUTE SERVICE ALLOWING THEM THE FREEDOM TO TRAVEL WHEN AND WHERE THEY WANT TO GO WITHOUT DEPENDING UPON PARATRANSIT SERVICE WHICH MUST BE SCHEDULED AHEAD OF TIME AND COSTS ARE HIGHER FOR THE RIDER.TRAVEL INSTRUCTION (ALSO KNOWN AS TRAVEL TRAINING) WILL BE ONE-TO-ONE INSTRUCTION DESIGNED TO TEACH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIORS TO TRAVEL SAFELY AND INDEPENDENTLY ON FIXED-ROUTE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN THEIR COMMUNITY. SUB-RECIPIENTS (EXCLUDING JTA):1) THE ARC JACKSONVILLE THIS IS TO CONTINUE A PROJECT THAT BEGAN IN OCTOBER OF 2009 FOR SERVICE THAT WAS NOT IN OPERATION PRIOR TO AUGUST OF 2005 AND IS BEYOND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ADA. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE SERVICE TO ARC CLIENTS AND WILL MAXIMIZE TRANSPORTATION THROUGH A COOPERATIVE AND COORDINATED EFFORT AS WELL AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS AS COORDINATED THROUGH JTA CONNEXION IN DUVAL CLAY AND BAKER COUNTIES. THE ARC JACKSONVILLE WILL PROVIDE GROUP TRIPS TO INDIVIDUALS WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY TO VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT. THIS TRANSPORTATION SERVICE WILL INCLUDE GROUPING PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AND COORDINATING SERVICES WITH EACH COMMUNITY PROGRAM PROVIDER SO THAT THE NEAREST SERVICE CENTER IS USED AND REDUCES OVERALL TRANSPORTATION COSTS. IN ADDITION FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIALIZED NEEDS THAT ARE ONLY AVAILABLE AT SPECIFIC CENTERS A TRANSFER PROGRAM IS BEING ESTABLISHED AT TWO NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS THUS CREATING AN INTER-CENTER SHUTTLE PROGRAM. THIS PROJECT FUNDING WILL BE FOR THE OPERATION OF THE SHUTTLES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PROJECT. THIS PROJECT SUPPORTS THE STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION OF MAXIMIZING THE USE AND OPERATING EFFICIENCY OF EXISTING VEHICLES CURRENTLY BEING USED BY THE ARC JACKSONVILLE AND PINE CASTLE WHO USE A VARIETY OF SOURCES TO TRANSPORT CLIENTS TO THEIR JOB AND INDEPENDENT LIVING TRAINING PROGRAMS INCLUDING THROUGH VEHICLES OPERATED BY THESE NON-PROFIT AGENCIES THE MED WAIVER PROGRAM OF THE AGENCY FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES MEDICAID THE FLORIDA TRANSPORTATION DISADVANTAGED PROGRAM AND IN A FEW INSTANCES THROUGH THE JTAS COMPLEMENTARY ADA PARATRANSIT SERVICE PROGRAM. AS SUCH VEHICLES ARE OPERATED BY MULTIPLE OPERATORS TO BRING ARC CLIENTS TO THE SAME TRAINING CENTERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT DUVAL COUNTY. WITH THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM THESE CLIENTS WILL UTILIZE SCHEDULED SHUTTLES OPERATING DIRECTLY TO THE NEAREST OF THE ARC CENTERS AND WHEN NECESSARY USE A SEPARATE EXPRESS SHUTTLE TO TRANSFER BETWEEN CENTERS. THE ARC CAN THEN CONCENTRATE ON FILLING ALL OF THE SEATS ON EACH SCHEDULED VEHICLE RATHER THAN HAVING MULTIPLE VEHICLES ARRIVING AT EACH CENTER WITH JUST ONE OR TWO PASSENGERS ON BOARD.2) CLAY COUNTY COUNCIL ON AGING (CCCOA) - THIS APPROPRIATION IS TO AUGMENT THE NEW FREEDOM PROGRAM THAT WAS STARTED BY THE CCCOA IN FY 2009 AND THESE SERVICES WERE NOT IN OPERATION PRIOR TO AUGUST OF 2005 AND THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN CLAY COUNTY AND IS BEYOND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ADA. THE CURRENT SERVICES INCLUDE THE CONTINUED OPERATIONS OF THE NF SERVICE ROUTE FROM GREEN COVE SPRINGS THROUGH ORANGE PARK TO NAS JAX AND ON TO EVEREST COLLEGE AND TARGET WHERE THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED WORKERS ARE EMPLOYED;
