INEFFICIENCIES IN LINKING THOSE WHO ARE TESTED FOR HIV TO ART SERVICES IS ALSO ANOTHER CHALLENGE.  AMREF TANZANIA IN CONSORTIUM WITH PARTNERS THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IN BALTIMORE (UMB), AFYA PLUS, AND THE TANZANIA CENTER FOR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS (TCDC) COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS \u201cAFYA THABITI\u201d PROPOSES A COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT-CENTERED DATA DRIVEN PROGRAM THAT WILL IMPROVE ACCESS AND UPTAKE OF QUALITY HIV & TB SERVICES, EXPANDING THE COHORT OF PLHIV ON ART AND ACCELERATING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE ATTAINMENT OF THE UNAIDS 95-95-95 TARGETS FOR EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN TANZANIA. AFYA THABITI WILL IMPLEMENT VARIOUS INITIATIVES, USING MULTI-DISCIPLINARY HF TEAMS TO PROVIDE SITE LEVEL TECHNICAL SUPPORT THAT INCLUDE TRAINING, MENTORSHIP, AND COACHING. COMMUNITY-CENTERED AND POPULATION-SPECIFIC APPROACH INCLUDING THE USE OF EXPERT CLIENTS AND PEER VOLUNTEERS BE USED BY AFYA THABITI TO REACH KEY AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (KVPS). KEY STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AT ALL STAGES OF THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE THE MOH, REGIONAL AND COUNCIL HEALTH MANAGEMENT TEAMS (R/CHMTS), KVP-LED CSOS, OTHER IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS. THESE INITIATIVE AND APPROACHES WILL FACILITATE THE DELIVERY OF THE SET OF ACTIVITIES THE CONSORTIUM HAVE DESIGNED TO RESPOND TO THE MOH PRIORITIES AS SET IN THE NSP 2020-2025 AS WELL AS THE OUTCOMES PRESENTED BY CDC IN THE PRESENT NOFO.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT CONSISTS OF SIX STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (SO) AND A ROBUST EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PLAN. SO ONE WILL FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTING EFFICIENT HIV CASE-FINDING ACTIVITIES TO ACHIEVE THE 1ST 95 TARGET, SO TWO WILL FOCUS ON THE IMMEDIATE LINKAGE TO TREATMENT FOR THOSE NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH HIV AND PREVENTION SERVICES FOR THE HIV-NEGATIVES. SO THREE AND FIVE FOCUSES ON ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING HIGH-QUALITY ART AND TB SERVICES INCLUDING THE PREVENTION OF MOTHER TO CHILD TRANSMISSION OF HIV (PMTCT). IN SO FOUR, AFYA THABITI WILL DELIVER STRATEGIC VOLUNTARY MEDICAL MALE CIRCUMCISION (VMMC) SUPPORT TO R/CHMTS AND HEALTH FACILITIES (HFS) HELPING TO REDUCE HIV TRANSMISSION. LASTLY, SO SIX PRESENTS THE PROJECTS ACTIVITIES THAT WILL ENSURE COLLECTION, TRANSMISSION, AND UTILIZATION OF HIGH-QUALITY DATA FROM THE HFS. ACTIVITIES WILL BE DRIVEN BY CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PRINCIPLES SUPPORTED BY INTEGRATED SUPPORTIVE SUPERVISION TO  ENSURE OWNERSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY OF PROGRAM BY THE R/CHMTS AND SITE STAFF.  TO IMPLEMENT PROJECT ACTIVITIES, THERE NEEDS TO BE REFLECTIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY AND REVIEWS BUILT-IN TO TRACK PROGRESS.

THE OVERALL PURPOSE OF THIS APPLICATION FOR FUNDING IS TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN HIV EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN KIAMBU COUNTY IN CONTRIBUTION TO THE NATIONAL EPIDEMIC CONTROL BY IMPLEMENTING  QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE HIV AND TB PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES. SPECIFICALLY, THE FUNDING WILL HELP TO PROGRESSIVELY TRANSITION THE MANAGEMENT AND FINANCING OF HIV SERVICES FROM PEPFAR TO THE CGK, LEVERAGING COLLABORATION WITH PEPFAR IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS (IP) TO BUILD AND STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY REQUIRED FOR THE TRANSITION.  WE HAVE CHOSEN TO DIRECTLY PLAN, BUDGET, IMPLEMENT, AND MONITOR HIV SERVICES IN JUJA SUB-COUNTY AND INCREMENTALLY TO OTHER SUB-COUNTIES BASED ON THE THE LESSONS LEARNED. WE HAVE CHOSEN JUJA BECAUSE OF ITS UNIQUE POPULATION MIX AND THE RELATIVELY POORLY DEVELOPED HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE.  KIAMBU WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL CONTROL OF THE NATIONAL HIV EPIDEMIC BY REDUCING HIV-RELATED ILL-HEALTH AND DEATHS AMONG PERSONS LIVING WITH HIV THROUGH: INCREASING CHMT LEADERSHIP IN HIV SERVICE DELIVERY; INCREASING COUNTY FUNDING ALLOCATION TO HRH AND HIV SERVICE DELIVERY; AND REDUCING HIV-RELATED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AMONG ADULTS, CHILDREN, MOTHERS, HEI, TB PATIENTS, KP AND PP IN THE COUNTY. INCREASING CHMT LEADERSHIP IN HIV SERVICE DELIVERY WILL BE ACHIEVED BY IMPROVING DATA-DRIVEN PLANNING; MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF HRH; HIV SERVICE DELIVERY; AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN. INCREMENTAL FINANCING OF HRH AND HIV SERVICE DELIVERY WILL INCREASE COUNTY FUNDING ALLOCATION FOR HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY.  TO REALIZE THESE OUTCOMES, KIAMBU MUST BEGIN BY IMPROVING THE CAPACITY OF CGK TO OVERSEE AND MANAGE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HIV SERVICES; INCREASING ACCESS TO HTS, PREVENTION, CARE, TREATMENT, AND SUPPORT SERVICES; INCREASING THE COVERAGE OF TB SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS AMONG HIV PATIENTS IN CARE; INCREASING THE USE OF HIV TREATMENT AMONG HIV INFECTED PREGNANT AND BREASTFEEDING WOMEN; IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND DELIVERY OF HIV AND TB PREVENTION, AND LABORATORY SERVICES; IMPROVING DATA QUALITY, REPORTING, AND USE AT THE FACILITY AND COUNTY LEVEL; AND INCREASING CONTRIBUTION TO HIV/TB SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES.

ACCORDING TO KENPHIA 2018, THE HIV PREVALENCE IN KENYA IS 4.4% AMONG ADULTS. THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN IS GENERALISED BUT CONCENTRATED AMONG KEY POPULATION (KP) GROUPS. AN ANALYSIS OF KASF I ACHIEVEMENTS SUGGESTS THAT INCIDENT INFECTIONS DECREASED BY 43% AGAINST A TARGET OF 75%. THE NUMBER OF AIDS RELATED DEATHS (ARD) DECLINED BY 65% DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF KASF I (2014/15-2019/20) COMPARED TO THE MODEST TARGET OF 25%. WHILE KASF I AIMED AT INCREASING DOMESTIC FUNDING FOR HIV BY 50%, ACTUAL FUNDING LEVELS INCREASED BY 32%. THE HIV PREVALENCE RATE IN KIRINYAGA COUNTY IS 3.0% (ADULT FEMALE 3.9%, MALE 2.1%). PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV ARE ESTIMATED AT 14,594 (ADULT 13,803 AND PAEDIATRIC 791) WITH NEW HIV INFECTIONS OF 169 (ADULTS 128 AND PAEDIATRICS 41) AND HIV RELATED DEATHS OF 226 (ADULTS 188, PAEDIATRICS 38) ANNUALLY WHILE THE ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULTS (AYP) ACCOUNT FOR 5.6% OF ALL PLHIV. THOUGH THE COUNTY HAS NEAR UNIVERSAL PMTCT COVERAGE AND PROPHYLAXIS AT 99%, THE MATERNAL CHILD TRANSMISSION RATE IS HIGH AT 9% (REGIONAL ESTIMATES). THE HIV PROGRAM IN KIRINYAGA COUNTY BEGAN IN 2004 WITH 1 SITE (KERUGOYA DISTRICT HOSPITAL) PROVIDING HIV COUNSELLING AND TESTING AND CARE AND TREATMENT. SINCE THEN, THE NUMBER OF ART SITES HAS INCREASED TO 62 WHERE 11,130 (KHIS JUNE 2020) PATIENTS ARE ENROLLED. THROUGH THE SUPPORT OF THE PEPFAR/CDC SUPPORTED LOCAL IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS, THE COUNTY HAS A WELL-ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF FACILITIES AND TRAINED STAFFS OFFERING HIV SERVICES. THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS AT STRENGTHENING CHMT OVERSIGHT ROLE AS WELL AS CAPACITY BUILDING ON PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION TO PREPARE FOR A SEAMLESS TRANSITION OF HIV SERVICES TO THE COUNTY. APPROACH AND OUTCOMES: BUILDING FROM EXPERIENCE ACCRUED OVER A DECADE OF IMPLEMENTING HIV ACTIVITIES UNDER PEPFAR, THE CHMT PROPOSES A HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING APPROACH ACROSS THE 95-95-95 CASCADE AND ALONG THE FACILITY TO COMMUNITY CONTINUUM TO PROGRESSIVELY MANAGE, SUSTAIN, AND TRANSITION FINANCING OF HIV SERVICE DELIVERY FROM PEPFAR. THE PROJECT SEEKS TO INCREASE CHMT LEADERSHIP IN SERVICE DELIVERY AS WELL AS INCREASE ITS CAPACITY TO BUDGET, PLAN AND EXECUTE PLANS FOR HIV ACTIVITIES IN THE COUNTY. THE CHMT WILL WORK TO CREATE EFFICIENCIES IN HIV PROGRAMMING BY PROMOTING SERVICE INTEGRATION, HUMAN RESOURCE RIGHT-SIZING AND DECENTRALISED MODELS OF CARE INCLUDING STRENGTHENED COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEMS SUPPORTED BY ROBUST LINKAGE AND REFERRAL SYSTEMS. CHMT WILL STRENGTHEN HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT STRATEGIC PLANNING, REPORTING, QUALITY ASSURANCE, DECISION-MAKING AND SURVEILLANCE. CRITICALLY, CHMT WILL STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY FOR SUB-COUNTY TEAMS, FACILITIES AND UNITS TO ROUTINISE CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT CYCLES ACROSS ALL PROGRAMMATIC COMPONENTS IN LINE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT (TQM). IN THE FIRST YEAR OF AWARD, FOCUS WILL BE ON MWEA CONSTITUENCY (KIRINYAGA SOUTH/MWEA EAST AND KIRINYAGA NORTH/MWEA WEST SUB COUNTIES) AN AGRO-ECONOMIC URBAN REGION WITH HIGH POVERTY LEVELS, OVERCROWDING AND POOR SANITATION. IN THE SECOND YEAR, AN INCREMENTAL EXTENSION TO ADDITIONAL SUB-COUNTIES WILL BE INITIATED, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO TRANSITION OF ALL THE 5 SUB-COUNTIES TO THE CHMT WITHIN THE PROJECT PERIOD. WE WILL EMPLOY 8 STRATEGIES WITH VERY CLEAR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES ON EACH TO ACHIEVE THE LONG-TIME GOAL.

DRIVEN BY THE PEPFAR STRATEGY FOR ACCELERATING HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC CONTROL (2017-2020), SOME SUPPORTED COUNTRIES HAVE ACHIEVED EPIDEMIC CONTROL BENCHMARKS AND UNAIDS 90-90-90 TARGETS. THROUGH PEPFAR, OVER 17.2 MILLION PEOPLE WERE ON LIFE SAVING ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT (ART), 2.8 MILLION BABIES WERE BORN HIV-FREE, AND OVER 6.7 MILLION ORPHANS, VULNERABLE CHILDREN (OVC), AND THEIR CAREGIVERS RECEIVED CRITICAL CARE AND SUPPORT AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (PEPFAR, 2021). THE GLOBAL RESPONSE HAS ALREADY TRANSITIONED TO THE MORE AMBITIOUS UNAIDS 95-95-95 TARGETS IN THE BACKDROP OF DISRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. KENYA RECENTLY LAUNCHED THE SECOND AIDS STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK (KASF II) FOR THE PERIOD 2020-2025 TO GUIDE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE-CENTERED 95-95-95 TARGETS BY 2025. HAVING THE FIFTH LARGEST EPIDEMIC WITH 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV), THE COUNTRY?S INCIDENCE TO PREVALENCE RATIO (IPR) IN 2019 WAS 2.77 INDICATING PROGRESS TOWARDS EPIDEMIC CONTROL. DECLINING AIDS-RELATED DEATHS AND NEW INFECTIONS BY 59 AND 44 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY IN 2019 COMPARED TO 2010, AVERTING 118,300 MOTHER-TO-CHILD INFECTIONS, AS WELL AS ACHIEVING THE FIRST 90 TARGET, DEMONSTRATE THIS IMPORTANT PROGRESS (UNAIDS, 2020). HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES EXIST ? IN 2019, A THIRD OF ALL NEW INFECTIONS WERE AMONG ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN (AGYW) AGED 10 TO 24 YEARS; TREATMENT COVERAGE WAS SKEWED WITH A LARGER GAP AMONG CHILDREN (AT 32%); VIRAL SUPPRESSION WAS LOWER AMONG ADULT MEN AND CHILDREN COMPARED TO ADULT WOMEN (61% AND 51% RESPECTIVELY VS 74%); MORTALITY WAS HIGHEST AMONG ADULT MEN; AND KEY POPULATIONS REMAIN VULNERABLE BECAUSE OF STIGMA, DISCRIMINATION, CRIMINALIZATION, AND VIOLENCE. BY GEOGRAPHY, NINE OUT OF 13 PRIORITIZED COUNTIES ACCOUNTED FOR 44% OF ALL NEW INFECTIONS IN 2019 (MOH, 2021). HOMABAY, KISUMU, SIAYA, MIGORI, AND KISII COUNTIES I N WESTERN KENYA ARE AMONG THE 13 PRIORITIZED BY THE KASFII BASED ON THEIR INCIDENCE TO PREVALENCE RATIOS. HIV PREVALENCE IN HOMABAY COUNTY IS FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, AND TOGETHER WITH KISUMU, SIAYA, AND MIGORI, REPRESENT COUNTIES WITH THE HIGHEST HIV PREVALENCE IN KENYA. THESE FOUR COUNTIES ALSO ACCOUNT FOR A THIRD OF PLHIV, A THIRD OF NEW HIV INFECTIONS, A THIRD OF HIV POSITIVE PREGNANT WOMEN IN KENYA AND ARE HOME TO TRADITIONALLY NON-CIRCUMCISING COMMUNITIES, KEY POPULATIONS, AND A LARGE FISHER FOLK COMMUNITY. BY END OF 2019, ALL FIVE COUNTIES CONTRIBUTED OVER A THIRD (35%) OF 1.16 MILLION PLHIV ON ART IN KENYA, WITH MEAN COVERAGE RATES OF 82% (LOWEST IN KISII AT 78%), ACHIEVING VIRAL SUPPRESSION RATES ABOVE 90%. GAPS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO ACHIEVE THE 95-95-95 TARGETS. SCALE-UP OF ART IS REQUIRED TO CLOSE THE 26% UNMET TREATMENT NEED IN THE FIVE COUNTIES. ALSO, PROGRAM GAPS INCLUDING SUB-OPTIMAL RETENTION ON ART, SUB-OPTIMAL VIRAL SUPPRESSION AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, TUBERCULOSIS-RELATED MORTALITY, HIGH MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION RATE (9.3%), AND HIGH VULNERABILITY TO HIV INFECTION AMONG AGYW REQUIRE ATTENTION. FURTHER, VOLUNTARY MEDICAL MALE CIRCUMCISION (VMMC) COVERAGE GAPS PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG MEN AGED 10 TO 29 YEARS WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. ADDRESSING THESE LAST MILE GAPS WILL REQUIRE OPTIMIZING INTERVENTIONS THAT SHIFT FROM GENERALIZED POPULATION-BASED APPROACHES TO SURVEILLANCE ENABLING ROBUST, REAL-TIME DETECTION OF NEW INFECTIONS AND OUTBREAKS, CASE-BASED SURVEILLANCE, EXCELLENCE IN TREATMENT SERVICES FOR DURABLE VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AND RAPID RETURN TO TREATMENT FOR THOSE ALIVE BUT NO LONGER IN CARE.

CURRENT PRIORITIES IN THE GLOBAL HIV RESPONSE FOCUS ON ADVANCING EPIDEMIC CONTROL AND ACHIEVING 95-95-95 TARGETS IN HIGH-BURDEN SETTINGS. TO TAKE NATIONAL HIV PROGRAMS TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPACT, MINISTRIES OF HEALTH (MOH), PEPFAR IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS (IP), AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN PEPFAR- AND GF-SUPPORTED COUNTRIES REQUIRE HIGH-QUALITY, DATA-DRIVEN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (TA) TO IDENTIFY AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS REMAINING GAPS IN THE HIV PREVENTION, CARE, AND TREATMENT CASCADES USING EVIDENCE-BASED AND COST-EFFECTIVE APPROACHES. IN ADDITION, CROSS-PROGRAM, CROSS-COUNTRY LEARNING PLATFORMS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT BEST PRACTICE DIFFUSION AND PEER-TO-PEER KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FOR APPROPRIATE IMPLEMENTATION AND REAL-TIME USE OF DATA FOR DECISION MAKING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE, COST-EFFECTIVE, TARGETED TA FOR HIV PREVENTION, CARE, AND TREATMENT AS WELL AS CAPACITY BUILDING (CB) FOR MOH, IP, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ACHIEVE THE 95-95-95 TARGETS AND ADVANCE PROGRESS TOWARD EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN PEPFAR AND GF-SUPPORTED COUNTRIES. HARNESSING THE MOST UP-TO-DATE EVIDENCE TO INFORM ITS APPROACHES, AND IN LINE WITH CDC GUIDANCE, ICAP WILL PROVIDE TARGETED TA FOR: 1) CAPACITY BUILDING OF MOH, KEY STAKEHOLDERS, AND THE HEALTH WORKFORCE TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN CONTROL OF NATIONAL EPIDEMICS; 2) SERVICE PROVISION, TO IMPROVE DELIVERY OF HIGH-QUALITY, EVIDENCE-BASED HIV PREVENTION, CARE, AND TREATMENT SERVICES, INCREASE VS, AND DECREASE HIV TRANSMISSION AMONG HIGH-RISK AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (VP); AND 3) STRATEGIC INFORMATION, TO GENERATE TIMELY, ACTIONABLE, HIGH-QUALITY DATA AND INCREASE ITS USE TO INFORM HIV POLICY AND PROGRAMS. IN RESPONSE TO COUNTRY TA REQUESTS, ICAP WILL SELECT SUITABLE TA AND CB APPROACHES FROM ITS EXTENSIVE CATALOGUE OF FIELD-TESTED, EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS AND WORK CLOSELY WITH CDC-PEPFAR, MOH, IP, AND OTHER IN-COUNTRY STAKEHOLDERS TO DESIGN, PLAN, AND IMPLEMENT A PACKAGE OF SUPPORT TAILORED TO THE LOCAL EPIDEMIC, POPULATION GROUPS, AND HEALTH CARE WORKER CADRES. EMPLOYING AN UNWAVERING FOCUS ON USE AND GENERATION OF ACTIONABLE DATA ACROSS ALL STRATEGIES AND TECHNICAL DOMAINS, ICAP WILL PROVIDE TA TO MOH, PEPFAR IP, AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO IMPROVE HEALTH WORKFORCE ALLOCATION, PRODUCTIVITY, AND PERFORMANCE; INCREASE HIV SERVICE COVERAGE, QUALITY, AND ACCESS AMONG TARGET POPULATIONS, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND SERVICE AREAS; AND STRENGTHEN GENERATION AND USE OF ROUTINE AND ENHANCED DATA FOR DECISION-MAKING. A BETTER-ALIGNED, MORE PRODUCTIVE HEALTH WORKFORCE, TOGETHER WITH BETTER-TARGETED HIV SERVICE APPROACHES WILL PRODUCE HIGHER-QUALITY, MORE EFFICIENT, AND MORE EFFECTIVE HIV SERVICES, WHICH WILL IMPROVE KEY METRICS (E.G. TESTING COVERAGE, ART INITIATION, ADHERENCE, RETENTION, VS) THAT DRIVE PROGRESS TOWARD 95-95-95 AND EPIDEMIC CONTROL. BY APPLYING RIGOROUS AND COLLABORATIVE MONITORING, ICAP WILL ENSURE THAT IT MEETS OR EXCEEDS PROJECT-SPECIFIC TARGETS AND ACHIEVES ALL PROGRAM OUTCOMES. INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM PROGRAM OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE IMPROVED QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HIV PROGRAMS TO INCREASE RETENTION AND ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT FOR ALL PLHIV AND TO EFFECTIVE PREVENTION
