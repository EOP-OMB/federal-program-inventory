PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES -1) BY OBTAINING THE DESIRED NUMBER OF TWO INTERNS FOR UP TO 24 WEEKS. 2) BY TRAINING THE  INTERNS IN HISTORICAL AND NATURAL BASED INTERPRETATION AND IN TURN DEVELOPING NEW PROGRAMS THAT WILL BENEFIT THE PARK'S VISITORS. THIS WILL BE MEASURED BY THEIR ABILITY TO CONDUCT AND DEVELOP PROGRAMMING. 3) THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW COMMUNITY OUTREACH WHICH WILL CREATE NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH NEW AUDIENCES. THIS WILL BE MEASURED AND DOCUMENTED FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT'S EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE AND APPRAISAL PLAN (EPAP). 4) THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF NEW JUNIOR RANGER SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, ARTS AND MATH BASED DAY PROGRAMMING, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW HISTORICAL AND NATURE-BASED PROGRAMMING WHICH WILL EXPOSE NEW VISITORS AND GENERATIONS TO THE CONCEPTS OF SHARED HISTORY AND NATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCE STEWARDSHIP. 5) THE CREATION OF NEW SOCIAL AND DIGITAL MEDIA CONCEPTS AND PROGRAMS THAT WILL ENHANCE THE PARK'S OUTREACH HAND GIVE THESE PROGRAMS GREATER RELEVANCY TO YOUTH POPULATIONS. THIS COMPONENT WILL BE MEASURED BY OUR SOCIAL MEDIA LIKES, FOLLOWS, SHARES, ETC.6) ASSIST PARK STAFF IN DELIVERING THESE PROGRAMS TO PARK VISITORS IN AN INCLUSIVE AND MEANINGFUL WAY. THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS GIVEN, AND THE ATTENDANCE IS REPORTED ON A MONTHLY BASIS. 7) FOSTERING THE DESIRE FOR THE INTERNS TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT WITH THE NPS OR OTHER HISTORICAL AND LAND MANAGEMENT-BASED ORGANIZATIONS.
