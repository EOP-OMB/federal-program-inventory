STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT EDNA METHODS CAN BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY DETERMINE SITE OCCUPANCY, AND THAT ESTIMATES OF EDNA CONCENTRATION MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON RELATIVE POPULATION DENSITIES UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES (TAKAHARA ET AL. 2012  SCHMELZLE AND KINZIGER 2016  SALTER ET AL., 2019  STOEKLE ET AL. 2021  SHELTON ET AL. 2022). WHILE EDNA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT AQUATIC SPECIES AND TO CONDUCT MONITORING IN LARGE AREAS WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY, MINIMAL TAKE, AND LOWER COST (THOMSEN AND WILLERSLEV 2015), STANDARDIZED SURVEY PROTOCOLS ARE NEEDED FOR EDNA DATA TO BE SUFFICIENTLY CHARACTERIZED FOR REGULATORY DECISIONS. THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE  FIRST OF ITS KIND  GUIDANCE FOR THE STANDARDIZED APPLICATION OF EDNA APPROACHES FOR DETECTING AND MONITORING AN AQUATIC SPECIES LISTED UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED EDNA SURVEY PROTOCOL FOR NORTHERN TIDEWATER GOBY (EUCYCLOGOBIUS NEWBERRYI). THE TIDEWATER GOBY IS A SMALL (30-60 MM TOTAL LENGTH), BENTHIC FISH ENDEMIC TO LAGOONS, BAYS, AND ESTUARIES ALONG THE ENTIRE COAST OF CALIFORNIA (SWENSON, 1999). THE NUMBER OF SITES OCCUPIED BY TIDEWATER GOBY HAS DECLINED DUE TO COASTAL DEVELOPMENTS, DROUGHTS, AND EXOTIC SPECIES INTRODUCTIONS (SWIFT ET AL. 1989). TIDEWATER GOBY WERE LISTED AS ENDANGERED UNDER THE U.S. ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IN 1994 (USFWS, 2005). THE NORTHERN TIDEWATER GOBY (E. NEWBERRYI) IS KNOWN FROM MORE THAN 70 SITES BETWEEN THE PALOS VERDES PENINSULA AND THE CALIFORNIA-OREGON BORDER, AND IS THE FOCAL SPECIES FOR THIS STUDY (SWIFT ET AL., 2016). (THE RECENTLY DESCRIBED SOUTHERN TIDEWATER GOBY (E. KRISTINAE) IS KNOWN FROM ONLY NINE SITES SOUTH OF THE PALOS VERDES PENINSULA, LOS ANGELES COUNTY, TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY.) DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF SITES OCCUPIED BY NORTHERN TIDEWATER GOBY IS CRITICAL FOR MANAGEMENT (USFWS 2005). HOWEVER, DETERMINING SITE PRESENCE IS CHALLENGING AND THE SPECIES CAN BE EASILY OVERLOOKED USING CONVENTIONAL MONITORING APPROACHES WHEN ABUNDANCE IS LOW AND WHEN FIELD OBSERVATIONS ARE LIMITED BY WATER CLARITY, DEPTH, AND HABITAT SIZE AND COMPLEXITY. NORTHERN TIDEWATER GOBY ARE AN IDEAL CANDIDATE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL BECAUSE EXTENSIVE PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS ESTABLISHED EDNA METHODS AS EFFECTIVE MONITORING TOOL FOR THE SPECIES (SCHMELZLE AND KINZIGER 2016  SUTTER AND KINZIGER 2019  MARTEL ET AL. 2021). COMPARISON OF DETECTION PROBABILITIES BETWEEN EDNA METHODS AND STANDARDIZED SEINING APPROACHES REVEALED THAT EDNA METHODS HAVE NEARLY DOUBLE THE DETECTION RATE AS SEINING FOR NORTHERN TIDEWATER GOBY (SCHMELZLE AND KINZIGER 2016). FURTHER, EDNA MONITORING HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED TO GENERATE ACCURATE SINGLE-POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATES OF THE ENTIRE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF TIDEWATER GOBY (SUTTER AND KINZIGER 2019), AND RANGEWIDE CHARACTERIZATIONS OF SITE EXTINCTION AND COLONIZATION PATTERNS FROM YEAR TO YEAR (METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS  MARTEL ET AL. 2021).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6dbfa9e4-2810-6eee-6996-251196fb1203-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F23AF02651_1448"}, {"internal_id": 160833173, "Award ID": "F23AF02636", "Award Amount": 807826.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-07-11", "CFDA Number": "15.634", "Description": "THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS GRANT IS TO IMPLEMENT FLORIDA S STATE WILDLIFE ACTION PLAN WITH SELECT RESEARCH AND MONITORING PROJECTS AIMED AT BENEFITING SPECIES OF GREATEST CONSERVATION NEED.

THE FIELD WORK FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE FOCUSED ON FOUR REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT SHOW THE HIGHEST RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF LOGGERHEAD SHRIKES. DURING THE BREEDING SEASON (ROUGHLY APRIL-JULY), THE HIGHEST DENSITIES OF SHRIKES APPEAR TO BE IN THE FLINT HILLS REGION. DURING THE NON-BREEDING SEASON (DECEMBER-MARCH), THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF SHRIKES OCCURS IN THE SOUTHWEST MIXED-GRASS PRAIRIE REGION. THE STUDY REGION ENCOMPASSES THOSE TWO AREAS (26 COUNTIES) AND INCLUDES PORTIONS OF THE FLINT HILLS (KAY, NOBLE, OSAGE, PAWNEE, AND PAYNE COUNTIES), NORTH-CENTRAL MIXED-GRASS PRAIRIE (ALFALFA, BLAINE, GARFIELD, GRANT, KINGFISHER, LOGAN, AND MAJOR COUNTIES), SOUTH-CENTRAL CROSS TIMBERS (CARTER, GARVIN, JEFFERSON, LOVE, MURRAY, AND STEPHENS COUNTIES), AND SOUTHWEST MIXED-GRASS PRAIRIE REGIONS (BECKHAM, COMANCHE, COTTON, GREER, HARMON, JACKSON, KIOWA, AND TILLMAN COUNTIES). BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG-TERM DECLINE, A PROTOCOL IS NEEDED FOR HOW TO BEST MONITOR LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE POPULATIONS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT BREEDING (RESIDENT) AND NON-BREEDING (MIGRATORY) POPULATIONS MAY BE RESPONDING TO DIFFERENT PRESSURES. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THAT NEED THROUGH RESEARCH TO BETTER DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE, AND DENSITY OF LOGGERHEAD SHRIKES USING A COMBINATION OF SPATIAL MODELING, ROAD-BASED POINT-COUNT SURVEYS, AND COMMUNITY SCIENCE ENGAGEMENT TO ADDRESS LAND COVER AND LAND USE ASSOCIATIONS AT MULTIPLE SCALES IN BOTH WINTERING AND BREEDING SEASONS. THESE ANALYSES WILL HELP DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SURVEY PROTOCOL FOR FUTURE MONITORING OF AND MANAGEMENT FOR LOGGERHEAD SHRIKES IN OKLAHOMA. A SPATIAL DATABASE OF SHRIKE OCCURRENCES WILL BE DEVELOPED BY COMPILING DATA FROM EXISTING SOURCES INCLUDING THE OKLAHOMA BREEDING BIRD ATLAS, BREEDING BIRD SURVEY ROUTES, BREEDING SEASON AND WINTERING SEASON RECORDS FROM EBIRD AND INATURALIST, AND THE OKLAHOMA WINTER BIRD ATLAS. THIS WILL RESULT IN A COMPILED, SPATIALLY EXPLICIT DATABASE OF SHRIKE USE LOCATIONS, ANALYZABLE BY REGION, SEASON, AND YEAR. FOR EACH SHRIKE-USE LOCATION, A SERIES OF RANDOM LOCATIONS WILL BE DRAWN AT 2, 5, AND 10KM AWAY AND ENTERED INTO A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM DATABASE. THE RESULTING SPATIAL DATABASE WILL MAP THE DISTRIBUTION OF LOGGERHEAD SHRIKES AND IDENTIFY CLUSTERS OF HIGHER AND LOWER OCCURRENCE ACROSS THE STATE. THE RANDOMLY-SELECTED NON-USE LOCATIONS WILL PERMIT ANALYSIS OF LAND USE AND LAND COVER AT MULTIPLE SCALES WHICH WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS FOR SHRIKES. A ROAD-BASED SURVEY PROTOCOL WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR BOTH THE WINTER AND SUMMER FIELD SEASONS THAT WILL BE USED TO FILL-IN DISTRIBUTIONAL DATA GAPS AND VALIDATE DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE, AND HABITAT-USE MODELS. THIS SURVEY WILL CONSIST OF BRIEF ROADSIDE POINT-COUNTS ALONG ROUTES THAT WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 20 KM IN LENGTH AND PLACED ALONG EXISTING COUNTY ROADS. THE POINT-COUNT TECHNIQUE IS COMMONLY USED TO MONITOR BIRD COMMUNITIES AND THE DATA ARE COLLECTED BY AN OBSERVER PARKED ON A ROADSIDE AND RECORDING THE LOCATIONS OF BIRDS THAT ARE SEEN AND OR HEARD IN ALL DIRECTIONS AROUND THEIR STATIONARY POINT. FOR EACH SHRIKE SEEN OR HEARD, THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE OBSERVER AND THE BIRD WILL BE ESTIMATED IN 50-METER DISTANCE BANDS AND THE TIME OF THE FIRST DETECTION OF EACH BIRD WILL BE RECORDED IN ONE-MINUTE TIME INTERVALS. IN ORDER TO MEASURE DETECTION VARIABILITY, EACH TRANSECT WILL BE SURVEYED TWICE PER SEASON TO ANALYZE THE RATE AT WHICH SHRIKES ARE DETECTED DURING SURVEYS. INDIVIDUAL SAMPLING POINTS AND DETECTION TIMES WILL BE ARCHIVED IN A GIS DATABASE AND USED TO ANALYZE DETECTION USING TIME REMOVAL AND OR DISTANCE SAMPLING, OCCUPANCY, AND THE INFLUENCE OF LAND USE, LAND COVER, AND DEGREE OF WOODY ENCROACHMENT ON SHRIKE OCCURRENCE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OK", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "23811f9c-d0c8-8509-0a9e-c8ca7d1a86d1-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F23AF02627_1448"}, {"internal_id": 160632073, "Award ID": "F23AF02434", "Award Amount": 1093594.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-29", "CFDA Number": "15.634", "Description": "THIS GRANT IS IMPLEMENTED BY THE MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION TO ACCOMPLISH CCS (STATE WILDLIFE ACTION PLAN (SWAP))OBJECTIVES AND INCLUDES TWO PROJECTS.PROJECT A PROVIDES ADMINISTRATION FOR THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COORDINATION NEEDED TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE CCS (SWAP).

IT LACKS MEASURABLE PETROLEUM BIOMARKERS AND POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS. WHEN COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL DIESEL FUEL, THE AROMATIC CONTENT OF PURE RENEWABLE DIESEL IS REDUCED. THE AROMATIC FRACTION OF FUELS IS OF TOXICOLOGICAL INTEREST AND ITS REDUCTION IN RENEWABLE DIESEL MAKES IT LIKELY THAT ITS TOXICITY WILL ALSO BE REDUCED. HOWEVER, THE TOXICITY OF RENEWABLE DIESEL IS LARGELY UNTESTED. BLENDED RENEWABLE FUELS ARE COMPLEX MIXTURES AND LIKELY TO HAVE DIFFERENT TOXICITY PROFILES THAN THE PURE PRODUCT. IT IS THOUGHT THAT RENEWABLE FUELS MAY ELICIT SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AS THEIR PETROLEUM COUNTERPARTS. HOWEVER, VERY LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO CORROBORATE THAT CLAIM. TO REDUCE THE DATA GAP, WE WILL CONDUCT TOXICITY STUDIES USING STANDARD TESTING PROTOCOLS THAT WILL ASSESS IMPACTS TO MARINE, FRESHWATER, AND TERRESTRIAL ORGANISMS FROM RELEASE OF RENEWABLE FUELS. WHEN PETROLEUM-BASED FUELS ARE SPILLED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, MANY FATE AND EFFECTS PROCESSES OCCUR LEADING TO PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES TO THE FUEL. THE ENVIRONMENTAL FATE OF RENEWABLE DIESEL IS ASSUMED TO BE SIMILAR TO THAT OF CONVENTIONAL DIESEL FUEL.

FROM MAY 2018 TO DECEMBER 2020,THERE WERE AT LEAST 11 MAJOR U.S. CASES INVOLVING THE CONFISCATION OF 11,892 TURTLES (FIGURE 1).MANY OF THE SPECIES BEING TARGETED ARE SGCN, STATE LISTED SPECIES, OR SPECIES BEING PETITIONED FORLISTING UNDER THE U.S. ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT (WOOD, BLANDING'S, AND SPOTTED). SGCN TURTLESFACING EXTREMELY HIGH DEMAND IN THE ILLEGAL TRADE INCLUDE EASTERN BOX TURTLE, SPOTTED TURTLE,DIAMONDBACK TERRAPIN, WOOD TURTLE, BOG TURTLE, AND BLANDING'S TURTLE. OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD(2017-2020), SERVICE INSPECTORS HAVE INTERDICTED (I.E., DETECTING, DETAINING, OR SEIZING WILDLIFETHAT HAS ENTERED THE STREAM OF COMMERCE) SHIPMENTS CONTAINING MORE THAN 7,000 INDIVIDUALTURTLES REPRESENTING 13 DIFFERENT NATIVE SPECIES AT THE INTERNATIONAL MAIL FACILITY AT JFK AIRPORT.THE SOUTHEAST REGION IS EXPERIENCING SIMILAR NUMBERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (PERS. COMM. SERVICEOLE CHIEF, R1). TURTLE POPULATIONS, INCLUDING POPULATIONS FOUND IN THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITEDSTATES, ARE DECLINING RAPIDLY DUE TO HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION, ROAD MORTALITY, AND NESTPREDATION FROM HUMAN SUBSIDIZED PREDATORS. THE ADDITIONAL LOSS OF ADULT TURTLES FROM ILLEGALCOLLECTION FOR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE HAS AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THE PERSISTENCE OFTHESE SPECIES. MANY OF THESE TAXA COULD BECOME EXTINCT THIS CENTURY IF THE AFOREMENTIONED THREATSARE NOT ADDRESSED (STANFORD ET AL. 2020).
