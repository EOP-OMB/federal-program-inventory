OVER 19,000 POTENTIAL TAPPING SITES (>250 TAPS WITHIN 4 ACRES) HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND MAPPED IN WESTERN WASHINGTON. INTEREST HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL. THE RESEARCH TEAM HAS RECEIVED NUMEROUS INQUIRIES FROM LANDOWNERS,AND THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN FEATURED ON NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO,Q13 FOX EVENING NEWS,SEATTLE TIMES,KITSAP SUN,AND UW TODAY. OBSTACLES HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED. BIGLEAF SAP CAN FLOW FROM LATE NOVEMBER THROUGH FEBRUARY. FREEZING NIGHTS CAN BE INTERMITTENT,FOLLOWED BY RAPIDLY WARMING DAYS,WITH TEMPERATURES INTO THE 40S. IRREGULAR SAP FLOW REDUCES THE EFFICIENCY OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED,LEAVING EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT IDLE FOR WEEKS BETWEEN SAP EVENTS. SAP CAN QUICKLY DEVELOP BACTERIA,ALTERING THE TASTE.
