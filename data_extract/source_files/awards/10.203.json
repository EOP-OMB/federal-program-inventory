SREEKALA BAJWA. MONTANA IS HOME TO THE MOST LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS IN THE NATION, WITH SEVEN TRIBAL COLLEGES, OR 1994 LAND GRANT INSTITUTIONS. THE MAES MISSION IS TO \"GENERATE AND DISSEMINATE SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF COMMUNITIES CAPTURING VALUE FROM MONTANA'S AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES, PRESERVE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL OUR CITIZENS.\" TO FULFILL THIS MISSION, MAES RESEARCH FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING RELEVANT CHALLENGES FACING MONTANA'S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATING THAT RESEARCH ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF AUDIENCES. THIS ENSURES THE RESEARCH IS BOTH INFORMED BY, AND INFORMS, THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WHO WILL MOST BENEFIT FROM NEW KNOWLEDGE. EIGHTY PERCENT OF MAES FACULTY ARE LOCATED ON THE MAIN MSU CAMPUS IN BOZEMAN. MAES ALSO HAS SEVEN OFF CAMPUS RESEARCH CENTERS AND SIX CAMPUS FARMS. ALL HATCH MULTISTATE PROJECTS AT MSU ARE BASED WITHIN THE COA/MAES. MULTISTATE PROJECTS HAVE AN INTEGRATED FOCUS ON DEVELOPING ADVANCED SOLUTIONS TO DIVERSE CHALLENGES FACING MONTANA, THE REGION, THE NATION, AND THE WORLD. SOME OF THE TOP ISSUES INCLUDE WATER USE AND AVAILABILITY, UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON FOOD PRODUCTION AND SECURITY, ASSESSING BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO PRODUCTIVITY AND ECONOMIC RETURNS WITH SCARCE INPUTS, AND IMPROVING COST-EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES. IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES, COA/MAES USES SCIENCE-BASED APPROACHES SUCH AS IMPLEMENTATION OF PRECISION AND DATA-INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE, INNOVATIONS IN PLANT BREEDING, PEST MANAGEMENT, CROPPING SYSTEMS, ANIMAL NUTRITION, ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCH TO ADDRESS ANIMAL AND HUMAN SAFETY. FACULTY PARTICIPATE IN REGIONAL MULTISTATE PROGRAMS TRACKED THROUGH THE NATIONAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT SYSTEM (NIMSS). COMMITTEES REPORT ANNUALLY THROUGH THE NIMSS SYSTEM. PROJECTS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY ADMINISTRATIVE ADVISORS TO THE COMMITTEE AND REVIEW COMMITTEES. FUNDS TO TRAVEL TO MULTISTATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE CONTACT, AND FUNDS FOR RESEARCH ARE DISTRIBUTED PROPORTIONALLY TO DEPARTMENT HEADS FOR ASSIGNMENT TO INDIVIDUAL PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS. THE COA/MAES HAS AN ON-BOARDING PROGRAM FOR RECENTLY HIRED COA/MAES FACULTY. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT A VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING THE MULTISTATE PROJECT PROCESS, PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF MULTISTATE PROJECTS, HOW TO EFFECTIVELY WRITE PROPOSALS, THE IMPORTANCE OF DESCRIPTIVE ANNUAL SUMMARIES OF ACTIVITIES, AND TIPS FOR EFFECTIVELY DESCRIBING IMPACTS OF RESEARCH AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO MORE QUICKLY DEVELOP FACULTY'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TO FUNDING AGENCIES. PEOPLE WHO ATTEND MAES PROGRAMS ARE ASKED WHICH ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM, THEIR FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. MEDIA IS USED TO INFORM CLIENTELE ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE. CONVERSATIONS WITH PROGRAM ATTENDEES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS REVEAL CONCERNS/ISSUES THAT MIGHT NOT BE HEARD OTHERWISE. STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEES INCLUDE THE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE FOCUS GROUP, MAES STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL, AG COALITION (INCLUDES REPRESENTATION FROM THE AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION, MONTANA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION, MONTANA STOCKGROWERS, MONTANA GRAIN GROWERS, MONTANA FARMERS UNION, MONTANA WATER USERS, MONTANA WOOL GROWERS, SEED GROWERS AND SEED TRADE), AND OTHER STATE AND LOCAL GROUPS. SOME OF THESE GROUPS HAVE LEADERSHIP BOARDS THAT ARE ASKED FOR SPECIFIC INPUT. THE AG COALITION MEETS PERIODICALLY WITH DR. SREEKALA BAJWA TO REVIEW PROGRAM PRIORITIES, NEW INITIATIVES, FUNDRAISING EFFORTS, AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES. THE MAES ADVISORY COUNCIL MEETS THREE TIMES PER YEAR TO DISCUSS PROGRAM FOCUS AND DIRECTION, MONTANA LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES, AND PRODUCTIVITY/IMPACT OF RESEARCH AND OUTREACH. MONTANA'S OPEN MEETING LAW REQUIRES INVITING THE PUBLIC, AND THE ORGANIZER MUST PUBLISH AN AGENDA PER MONTANA CODE ANNOTATED 2-3-101. THE NEWLY IMPLEMENTED COA/MAES STRATEGIC PLAN INCLUDES SEVERAL OBJECTIVES TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN ENDURING PARTNERSHIPS TO INFORM AND ADVANCE THE LAND-GRANT MISSION. THIS INCLUDES INCREASING ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN FACULTY AND STAKEHOLDERS AND MAKING A CONCERTED EFFORT TO INCREASE INPUT FROM HISTORICALLY UNDER-REPRESENTED AND NON-TRADITIONAL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS.

THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW INDIVIDUAL FARMERS <(>&<)> AGRIBUSINESS FIRMS MAKE MANAGERIAL DECISIONS UNDER UNCERTAINTY, INCLUDING PRICE UNCERTAINTY, PRODUCTION RISK, AND REGULATORY <(>&<)> POLICY UNCERTAINTY. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES THAT FARMERS AND AGRIBUSINESS FIRMS USE TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE THESE RISKS INCLUDING DIVERSIFICATION, ACCESSING FINANCIAL SERVICES, AND PARTICIPATING IN CROP INSURANCE PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS ON FARMERS' ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES, FARM ASSET VALUES (PARTICULARLY LAND), AND CREDIT TERMS (INTEREST RATES). MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON CREDITWORTHINESS WILL BE EVALUATED BY ANALYZING LIQUIDITY, COVERAGE RATIOS, AND SOLVENCY AS THESE ARE METRICS USED BY LENDERS TO DETERMINE CREDITWORTHINESS. BOTH THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSES WILL BE PURSUED. GIVEN THE BOARD RESEARCH AGENDA, A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES WILL BE EMPLOYED. VARIOUS NATIONAL, STATE?LEVEL, AND FARM?LEVEL USDA DATASETS WILL BE USED. OTHER DATASETS SUCH AS DATA COLLECTED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS WILL BE EMPLOYED WHEN APPROPRIATE. WHILE MUCH OF THE RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON RECENT POLICY CHANGES IN THE AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2018 (2018 FARM BILL), OTHER POLICIES INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) REGULATIONS WILL ALSO BE ANALYZED. TARGET AUDIENCES BENEFITTING FROM THESE RESEARCH RESULTS INCLUDE POLICY MAKERS, PRACTITIONERS, AGRICULTURAL LENDERS, AGRIBUSINESS FIRMS, AND OTHER ACADEMICS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE RESEARCH OUTCOMES WILL IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT, CONTINUATION OR ELIMINATION OF CURRENT POLICIES IMPACTING THE FINANCIAL HEALTH AND WELL?BEING OF FARMERS SUCH AS SUBSIDIZED CROP INSURANCE PROGRAMS, POLICIES EXTENDING PREFERENTIAL INTEREST RATES AND OTHER SUBSIDY PROGRAMS THAT IMPACT PRODUCERS ACCESS TO CREDIT. CRITICAL ISSUE: WATER QUALITY AND CONSERVATION ADVANCED UNDERSTANDING AND PREDICTION OF POLLUTANTS IN CRITICAL LANDSCAPES IN WATERSHEDS. EFFECTIVE MITIGATION OF NONPOINT SOURCE (NPS) SURFACE WATER POLLUTION IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE MANY OF SOURCES, POLLUTANTS, PROCESS AND STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED. PRESENTLY, WATER QUALITY CONSERVATION PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO INSTALL BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPS) TO MITIGATE NPS HAVE NOT BEEN TARGETED TO THOSE AREAS OF THE LANDSCAPE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO NPS POLLUTION DISPROPORTIONATELY. LARGE REDUCTIONS IN WATERSHED?LEVEL NUTRIENT LOADS COULD BE ACHIEVED THROUGH COORDINATED PLACEMENT OF BMPS ON HIGH?CONTRIBUTING AREAS. THE PLACEMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF BMPS FOR CONTROLLING NPS REQUIRES A SUITE OF INDIVIDUAL AND COUPLED MECHANISTIC MODELS THAT EFFECTIVELY CAPTURE A RANGE OF FACTORS AND WATERSHED PROCESSES. THE GOAL OF THIS MULTISTATE RESEARCH PROJECT PROPOSALIS TO EXPLORE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS TO PREDICT BMP PERFORMANCE (INDIVIDUALLY AND CUMULATIVELY) AT THE VARIOUS SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. TOOLS DEVELOPED THROUGH THIS EFFORT CAN BE USED TO INFORM WATERSHED MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE PRESENCE OF PERVASIVE AND UNAVOIDABLE UNCERTAINTY TO ACHIEVE WATER QUALITY WHILE MINIMIZING INVESTMENT. THE PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATOR'S (PI) FOCUS WILL BE IN 3 KEY AREAS: A) ANALYSIS OF BMP (VEGETATIVE FILTER STRIPS) EFFECTIVENESS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE LANDSCAPE USING THE COMPUTER MODEL VFSMOD HE DEVELOPED B) ADOPTION OF STATE?OF?THE?ART AND OBJECTIVE MODEL EVALUATION METHODS WITH THE TOOL FITEVAL HE ALSO DEVELOPED AND C) SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF SYSTEM UNCERTAINTY IN MODEL APPLICATIONS AND PREDICTIONS BASED ON GLOBAL SENSITIVITY AND UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS (GSUA) WITH SOME OF THE NEW SCREENING TOOLS (ESU) DEVELOPED BY THE RESEARCH TEAM. THE TARGET AUDIENCE OF THESE RESULTS WILL BE RESEARCHERS, WATERSHED SPECIALISTS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS, LOCALSTAKEHOLDERS AND AGENCY PERSONNEL. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE RESEARCH ARE IMPROVED TARGETING TOOLS, MIXED?WATERSHED MODELING IMPROVEMENTS AND TO BETTER ADDRESS AND COMMUNICATE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO MONITORING AND MODELING. THE OVERALL OUTCOME OF THE PROJECT WILL BE A HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE WATERSHED WITH TARGETED BMP IMPLEMENTATION IN MIXED LAND USE WATERSHEDS. CRITICAL ISSUE: NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT ADVANCED UNDERSTANDING AND PREDICTION OF POLLUTANTS IN CRITICAL LANDSCAPES IN WATERSHEDS. DECLINING WATER QUALITY HAS BECOME A GLOBAL ISSUE OF CONCERN AS HUMAN POPULATIONS GROW AND AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES EXPAND. WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT REQUIRES THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT USE OF A GIVEN LIMITED AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, AND BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPS) ARE TOOLS COMMONLY USED TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTANT GENERATED AT THE SITE AND LOADED TO DOWNSTREAM WATERBODIES. HOWEVER, THE BMP IMPLEMENTATION IS OFTEN NOT OPTIMIZED TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF WATER BY PROVIDING INFORMATION, KNOWLEDGE, AND TOOLS THAT NATURAL RESOURCE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS CAN USE WHEN IDENTIFYING AREAS THAT PRODUCE RELATIVELY MUCH POLLUTANTS AND THE BEST COMBINATIONS OF THE LOCATIONS AND TYPES OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. ADVANCED MONITORING AND MODELING STRATEGIES WILL BE PROPOSED TO IMPROVE THE CAPACITY OF DETECTING WATER QUALITY ISSUES AND TACKLING THE ISSUES EARLY SO THAT MEASURES FOR IMPROVED WATER QUALITY CAN BE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED ON TIME. THE TOOLS, INFORMATION, AND KNOWLEDGE CREATED FROM THIS PROJECT ARE EXPECTED TO ENABLE THE PROACTIVE IDENTIFICATION AND REMEDIATION OF WATER QUALITY ISSUES AND THUS THE IMPROVEMENT OF WATER QUALITY. THIS WORK SEEKS TO DEVELOP TOOLS THAT UTILIZE BOTH MONITORING AND MODELING TO BETTER INFORM TARGETED BMP IMPLEMENTATION, ADVANCE WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY MODELS FOR MIXED?USE WATERSHEDS, TEST ADVANCED/NEW MONITORING TECHNOLOGIES TO DETECT WATER QUALITY ISSUES AND CONDUCT INTEGRATED ASSESSMENTOFUNCERTAINTY AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MONITORING AND MODELING APPROACHES BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND IN COMBINATION. EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ACRES THAT ARE PROTECTED BY BMPS, EFFICIENCY OF THE BMP AND AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE EXPECT DECREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTANTS CREATED AT SITE AND LOADED TO DOWNSTREAM WATERBODIES AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE WATER QUALITY OF DOWNSTREAM WATERBODIES. THE TARGET AUDIENCES OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE WATERSHED MANAGERS, AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERS, LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES THAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE WATER QUALITY OF THEIR WATERBODIES, CONCERNED GENERAL PUBLIC, NATURAL RESOURCE EXTENSION AGENTS, AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS AND SCIENTISTS. CRITICAL ISSUE: NUTRITION, HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY UNDERSTANDING AND PROMOTING HEALTH AND NUTRITION IN COMMUNITIES OF EMERGING ADULTS. EMERGING ADULTHOOD, OR THE TRANSITION THROUGH LATE ADOLESCENCE AND YOUNG ADULT YEARS, IS A DISTINCT STAGE OF LIFE ASSOCIATED WITH DECLINES IN HEALTHY LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS1?4. YOUNG ADULTS ARE AT RISK FOR UNHEALTHY WEIGHT GAIN AND DIETARY PATTERNS, AS WELL AS MORE SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES. THE DRAMATIC CHANGES IN LIVING AND SOCIAL SITUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH EMERGING ADULTHOOD HAVE BEEN LINKED TO ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. THESE OUTCOMES MAY BE FURTHER CHALLENGED BY THE ESCALATING COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE GLOBAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIES1?4. CAMPUSES AND COMMUNITIES WHERE YOUNG ADULTS RESIDE WILL BENEFIT FROM TIMELY AND PERSONALIZED INFORMATION, AS WELL AS UTILIZATION OF EVIDENCE?BASED TOOLS AND PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE THE HEALTH AND WELL?BEING OF THIS POPULATION. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS MULTISTATE PROJECT IS TO SUPPORT CAMPUSES AND OTHER COMMUNITIES IN CREATING ENVIRONMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT EMBRACE YOUNG ADULTS' UNIQUE BARRIERS TO A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE, PROMOTE HEALTHIER WEIGHTS, AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG VULNERABLE MEMBERS, WHO ARE THE FASTEST GROWN SEGMENTS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES (US). OUR HEALTHY CAMPUS RESEARCH CONSORTIUM (HCRC) INCLUDES 17 ACCOMPLISHED RESEARCHERS, ALONG WITH 20? 30 TALENTED GRADUATE STUDENTS, WHO HAVE MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF COLLABORATIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH YOUNG ADULTS. CUMULATIVELY, OUR INTERVENTIONS HAVE IMPROVED YOUNG ADULTS' FOOD, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND STRESS MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORS, AND OUR SURVEYS HAVE ELUCIDATED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THE HEALTHFUL CHOICE THE EASY CHOICE FOR YOUNG ADULTS AT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE NATION. OUR INTEGRATION OF TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND EXTENSION LEVERAGE MEMBERS EXPERTISE IN MANY STATES, WIDENING OUR SCOPE AND IMPACT. CONSIDERATION OF THE PERCEIVED AND ACTUAL ENVIRONMENT IN OBESITY PREVENTION PROGRAMS HAS BEEN HINDERED BY A LACK OF EFFICIENT, RELIABLE, AND VALID TOOLS. TO OVERCOME THIS, HCRC HAS IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT PREDISPOSE, ENABLE, AND REINFORCE HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS AMONG YOUNG ADULTS 8,12,13,16,55,56. VALID, RELIABLE, AND EFFICIENT TOOLSHAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ASSESS THE FOOD, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND POLICY ENVIRONMENTS OF COLLEGE CAMPUSES 17,19,57. THESE TOOLS ARE BEING USED BY RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS AROUND THE US TO BENCHMARK AND TRACK ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND PERCEPTIONS AND CREATE HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS FOR YOUNG ADULTS50. THEY ARE ALSO HELPING STAKEHOLDERS AND DECISION?MAKERS WHO WORK WITH TARGET COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY NEEDS AND EFFORTS TO DEVELOP HEALTHIER ENVIRONMENTS 9,14?16,18,20,58?63. DURING THE CURRENT GLOBAL PANDEMIC, THE NEED TO ELUCIDATE HOW IDFS (E.G., DISCRIMINATION, PANDEMIC/VIRAL OUTBREAK, NATURAL DISASTERS, OPIOID EPIDEMIC, RECESSION/DEPRESSION) INTERACT WITH HEALTH PROMOTION EFFORTS AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS IS PARAMOUNT. AS HCRC WORK CONTINUES, WE WILL EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS AND PERCEPTIONS OF YOUNG ADULT GROUPS AT GREATEST RISK TO THE IMPACT OF IDFS ON WEIGHT?RELATED BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. THIS PROJECT WILL AIM TO PROMOTE HEALTHY LIVINGIN DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF YOUNG ADULTS THROUGH THE: DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTHY CAMPUS RESEARCH CONSORTIUM (HCRC'S) SUITE OF TOOLS THAT UTILIZE A POLICY, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENT (PSE) APPROACH FOR CAMPUSES. DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY, SYSTEMS, ENVIRONMENT (PSE) ASSESSMENT TOOLS FOR URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES WITH LOW INCOME CONSIDERING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND INFLUENTIAL DISRUPTIVE FACTORS (IDFS). EXPANDED UNDERSTANDING OF COLLEGE STUDENTS' DIETARY PATTERNS CONSIDERING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND INFLUENTIAL DISRUPTIVE FACTORS (IDFS) WITH AN EMPHASIS ON FOOD INSECURITY, MENTAL HEALTH, AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. EXPLORATION AND INTERPRETATION OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS USING BIG DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES WITH MULTIPLE DATA SETS. CRITICAL ISSUE: FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY, AND COMMUNITY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH RESILIENCE IN DIVERSE, RURAL, LOW?INCOME FAMILIES (HATCH MULTISTATE) A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES AND MECHANISMS OF FAMILY RESILIENCY IN RURAL AREAS, AS WELL AS THE BEST METHODS FOR SUPPORTING RURAL FAMILIES, IS LIMITED, WARRANTING ADDITIONAL RESEARCH TO PROVIDE INSIGHTS. THEREFORE, THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE BY (A) ASSESSING COMMUNITY CAPACITY IN RURAL AREAS AND (B) EXAMINING RESILIENCY AMONG RURAL LOW?INCOME FAMILIES WITH ATTENTION TO THREE LEVELS ? INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY, AND COMMUNITY. WE WILL USE THE NEW DATA COLLECTION TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING RURAL FAMILIES SPEAK AND RURAL FAMILIES SPEAK ABOUT HEALTH DATA. AN ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK CONTINUES TO GUIDE THE WORK OF OUR MULTISTATE COLLABORATION, BUT FOR THE PROPOSED NEXT STEPS, WE ALSO INTEGRATE AND RELY HEAVILY UPON A RISK AND RESILIENCY FRAMEWORK. THE ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS MODEL, MORE SPECIFICALLY THE PROCESS?PERSON?CONTEXT?TIME (PPCT) MODEL (BRONFENBRENNER <(>&<)> MORRIS, 2006), EMPHASIZES UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A DEVELOPING PERSON IN VARIOUS CONTEXTSOVER TIME, THAT IS, THE PROXIMAL PROCESSES DRIVING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THE LIVES OF RURAL, LOW?INCOME FAMILIES ARE COMPLEX, THEREFORE WE MUST CONSIDER THE CONFLUENCE OF MULTIPLE FACTORS. THUS, KEY TO HELPING LOW?INCOME FAMILIES IS TO MOVE BEYOND SIMPLY IDENTIFYING FACTORS CORRELATED WITH RESILIENCE TO INVESTIGATING THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THEY CAN THRIVE IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY. RESILIENCE IS A DYNAMIC PROCESS BY WHICH INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS ADAPT POSITIVELY TO ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES; IT IS NOT THE PROCESS OF EVADING RISK BUT RATHER SUCCESSFULLY DRAWING UP RESOURCES TO NAVIGATE THROUGH STRESSFUL EXPERIENCES (MASTEN, 2018). INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESILIENCY IS OPTIMIZED WHEN PROTECTIVE FACTORS ARE STRENGTHENED AT ALL THREE INTERACTIVE LEVELS OF THE SOCIOECOLOGICAL MODEL ? INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY, AND COMMUNITY LEVELS (BENZIES <(>&<)> MYCHASIUK, 2009, P. 103). INDIVIDUAL PROTECTIVE FACTORS INCLUDE A POSITIVE OUTLOOK, INTERNAL LOCUS OF CONTROL, EFFECTIVE COPING SKILLS, EDUCATION AND TRAINING, HEALTH. FAMILY PROTECTIVE FACTORS INCLUDE FAMILY STRUCTURE, FLEXIBILITY, SOCIAL SUPPORT, ADEQUATE INCOME, AND ADEQUATE HOUSING. COMMUNITY PROTECTIVE FACTORS INCLUDE SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS, ACCESS TO QUALITY SCHOOL AND CHILD CARE, AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING (E.G., BENZIES <(>&<)> MYCHASIUK, 2009; WALSH, 2002). DUE TO THE INTERACTIONS OF MANY FACTORS WITHIN AND ACROSS SYSTEMS LEVELS, THERE ARE DIVERSE PATHWAYS TO ADAPTATION (MASTEN, 2018). TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THESE DIVERSE PATHWAYS, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE VARIETY OF RISK (I.E., VULNERABILITY) AND PROTECTIVE (I.E., ASSET) FACTORS AND PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH RESILIENCE ACROSS A RANGE OF SIGNIFICANT STRESSORS EXPERIENCED BY RURAL, LOW?INCOME FAMILIES. THE TARGET AUDIENCES OF THIS WORK WILL BE RURAL FAMILIES, WITH A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON RURAL, LOW?INCOME MOTHERS. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE: 1) IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE OF COMMUNITY?LEVEL ASSETS AND CHALLENGES RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESILIENCE AMONG RURAL, LOWINCOME MOTHERS. 2) NEW AND STRENGTHENED PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTY AND STATE STAKEHOLDERS AND ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND RESILIENCE AMONG DIVERSE RURAL, LOW?INCOME FAMILIES. 3) IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MULTILEVEL FACTORS AND PROCESS OF RESILIENCE AMONG RURAL, LOW?INCOME MOTHERS. 4) DEVELOPMENT OF UNDERGRADUATE, MASTER'S, AND DOCTORAL TRAINED RESEARCHERS IN MULTI?METHOD DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSIS, AND DISSEMINATION FOCUSED ON RURAL, LOW?INCOME FAMILIES. CRITICAL ISSUE: YOUTH UNDERSTANDING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION IN THE 4H CLUB PROGRAM 4?H CLUBS, COMMUNITY CENTERED AND LARGELY VOLUNTEER DRIVEN, HAVE BEEN A STAPLE IN HIGH?QUALITY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM DELIVERY SINCE OUR ORGANIZATION'S INCEPTION. YOUTH WHO PARTICIPATE IN 4?H EARN HIGHER GRADES, HAVE HIGHER CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, AND ENGAGE IN LESS RISKY BEHAVIOR COMPARED TO NON?4?H YOUTH (LERNER <(>&<)> LERNER, 2013). ALTHOUGH IMPRESSIVE, POSITIVE IMPACTS SUCH AS BEHAVIOR CHANGE, CAN ONLY BE MADE IF PARTICIPANTS REMAIN IN EXTENSION PROGRAMS, SUCH AS4?H, OVER TIME (PRATT <(>&<)> BOWMAN, 2008). A REVIEW OF THE USDA 4?H ENROLLMENT REPORTS (UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, 2010) FROM 1996 TO 2003 INDICATES THAT 31 (54%) OF THE STATES AND TERRITORIES IN THE US REPORTED DECLINES IN 4?H CLUB ENROLLMENT. ONE OF THE PRIMARY INDICATORS FOR YOUTH DROPPING OUT OF THE 4?H PROGRAM IS BEING A FIRST?YEAR MEMBER (ASTROTH, 1985; HAMILTON, NORTHERN, <(>&<)> NEFF, 2014; HARDER, LAMM, LAMM, ROSE, <(>&<)> RASK, 2005; HARTLEY, 1983). OTHER RESEARCH REVEALS THAT DROPPING OUT OF 4?H OCCURS BECAUSE: 1) YOUTH ARE BUSY WITH SPORTS OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, 2) YOUTH ARE UNHAPPY/UNSATISFIED WITH THEIR CLUBS OR PROJECTS, AND 3) PARENTS ARE NOT AS INVOLVED AS OTHER PARENTS IN THEIR CHILD'S 4?H EXPERIENCE (HARDER, ET AL., 2005; HARTLEY, 1983; RITCHIE <(>&<)> RESLER, 1993). DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ALSO INFLUENCE DROPOUT (E.G., GENDER AND YEARS IN PROGRAM; ASTROTH, 1985, HARDER ET AL., 2005), AS WELL AS ENTERING THE PROGRAM AS AN ADOLESCENT (DEFORE, FUHRMAN, PEAKE, <(>&<)> DUNCAN, 2011; RITCHIE, <(>&<)> RESLER, 1993). BY LEARNING ABOUT THESE FACTORS, WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF YOUTH ABLE TO FULLY EXPERIENCE THE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF 4?H PROGRAMS AND THUS IMPACT THE LEVEL OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION, RECOMMENDATIONS BY USDA TO INCREASE AND EXPAND 4?H MEMBERSHIP COULD BE ADDRESSED, IN PART, BY YOUTH RETENTION. 1ST YEAR 4?H FAMILIES WILL BE THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS RESEARCH WITH THE FOLLOWING EXPECTED OUTCOMES: INCREASED AWARENESS OF GENERALIZABILITY OF MULTISTATE FINDINGS FOR 4?H YOUTH AND FAMILY RETENTION CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS, FACT SHEETS, WEBINARS, ETC. TO DISSEMINATE FINDINGS PUBLICATION OF JOINT (ACROSS THE STATES INVOLVED) RESEARCH ARTICLES AND/OR REVIEW ARTICLES.

PLAN OVERVIEW 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE GEORGIA PLAN OF WORK (POW) ENCOMPASSES A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2022. THE PLAN ADDRESSES MAJOR AGRICULTURAL ISSUES AS WELL AS MANY OTHER PROBLEMS FACING RURAL AND URBAN AREAS, THE ENVIRONMENT, FAMILIES AND YOUTH. THE PLAN REPRESENTS A COORDINATED EFFORT BETWEEN THE STATE'S 1890 AND 1862 LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS, FORT VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY (FVSU) AND THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA (UGA), AND INCLUDES JOINT PLANNING BETWEEN EXPERIMENT STATIONS AND COOPERATIVE EXTENSION UNITS AT BOTH UNIVERSITIES.  GEORGIA, ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 13 COLONIES, HAS A LAND AREA OF 57,701 SQUARE MILES AND A WATER AREA OF 1,706 SQUARE MILES, WHICH MAKES IT THE LARGEST STATE EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER (21TH OVERALL). GEORGIA FALLS WITHIN FIVE MAJOR PHYSIOGRAPHIC REGIONS: THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHEAST; THE RIDGE AND VALLEY PROVINCE AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU IN THE NORTHWEST; THE PIEDMONT ACROSS CENTRAL GEORGIA; AND THE COASTAL PLAIN IN THE SOUTH. ELEVATIONS RANGE FROM SEA LEVEL TO 4,784 FEET AT BRASSTOWN BALD IN THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS.  THE 2020 CENSUS ESTIMATED GEORGIA'S POPULATION WAS 10,711,908 AND REPORTED 23.8% OF GEORGIANS ARE UNDER AGE 18 AND 13.9% ARE 65 OR OLDER. ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS,51.9% OF GEORGIANS IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS WHITE/CAUCASIAN, 31% AS BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN, 4.5% AS ASIAN,.5% AS AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE, .1% AS NATIVE HAWAIIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER, AND 6.9% AS MORE THAN ONE RACE. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT 10.5% OF GEORGIANS IDENTIFY AS HISPANIC OR LATINO.  GEORGIA'S COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM HAS 167 OFFICES, WITH PROGRAMMING IN ALL OF GEORGIA'S 159 COUNTIES. FVSU AND UGA PERSONNEL ARE HOUSED JOINTLY IN COUNTY OFFICES. EXTENSION DELIVERS PROGRAMMING IN AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES, AND 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AS BOTH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY EFFORTS AND AS MULTICOUNTY PROGRAMS. STATE FACULTY MEMBERS DELIVER TRAINING TO COUNTY AGENTS AND PROGRAMMING DIRECTLY TOCLIENTELE, WHEN APPROPRIATE.  FVSU AND UGA RESEARCH PROGRAMS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION SYSTEM. GEORGIA HAS SEVERAL CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE; ITS FOUR LARGEST ARE LOCATED IN ATHENS, FORT VALLEY, TIFTON AND GRIFFIN. GEORGIA HAS ELEVEN RESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS STRATEGICALLY LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE.  THIS JOINT PLAN OF WORK WAS DEVELOPED AROUND CORE PROGRAMS AND TARGETED ISSUES. USING A STRUCTURED PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM, GEORGIA DEVELOPS CORE PROGRAM DIRECTIONS AND IDENTIFIES TARGETED ISSUES. THE GEORGIA PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS A MULTISTEP PROCESS THAT IS OPERATIONAL EVERY YEAR. THE MODEL INCLUDES A METHOD FOR ASSESSING NEEDS AND IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS. IT ALSO INCLUDES PROGRAM EVALUATION TO DETERMINE IMPACT. THE GEORGIA PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MODEL WORKS IN UNISON WITH MULTIPLE ADVISORY SYSTEMS AT BOTH COUNTY AND STATE LEVELS.  INPUT SOLICITED DIRECTLY FROM ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AT FVSU'S COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE, FAMILY SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS UGA'S COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES (CAES) AND COLLEGE OF FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES AS PART OF THE ANNUAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF DEVELOPING THIS PLAN OF WORK. FACULTY MEMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PLAN ARE WORKING ON CUTTING-EDGE PROGRAMS. THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION AND INPUT FROM BOTH THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE AND PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE. THIS INPUT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AS IS A STRONG ADVISORY SYSTEM.  THE GEORGIA FEDERAL PLAN OF WORK DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE ALL OF THE WORK OF THE COLLEGES' FACULTY MEMBERS. IT IS INTENDED TO DOCUMENT THE PLANS AND ACTIONS OF THE FACULTY MEMBERS RECEIVING SPECIFIC FORMULA FUNDS. THE MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS ARE USED TO SUPPORT STATE-LEVEL CORE PROGRAMS. THESE CORE PROGRAMS COVER A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL ANIMAL AND PLANT PRODUCTION, POSITIVE YOUTH AND FAMILY DEVELOPMENT, URBAN AGRICULTURE, PERSONAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, AND EMERGING ISSUES, SUCH AS BIOFUELS.THEGOALS OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE TO DEMONSTRATE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPACT. HOWEVER, THE GREATEST IMPACTS OF THESE CORE PROGRAMS ARE THE FOUNDATIONS CREATED TO SUPPORT AND LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BEYOND STATE-MATCHING FUNDS. THE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING, COUNTY FUNDING, GRANTS AND GIFTS LEVERAGED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE WORK IN THIS PLAN MAY CREATE THE GREATEST FINAL IMPACT.  MOST OF GEORGIA'S PLANNED PROGRAMS INCLUDE OUTCOME MEASURES THAT TRACK THE OUTPUT LEVELS OF LEVERAGED PROGRAMMING. THE OUTPUTS OF THESE LEVERAGED PROGRAMS ARE CONSIDERED A DIRECT, SHORT- TERM OUTCOME OF THE CORE PLANNED PROGRAMS WITHIN THE GEORGIA FEDERAL PLAN OF WORK.  THE GEORGIA FEDERAL PLAN OF WORK IS CENTERED ON EIGHT PLANNED PROGRAMS. THESE WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT ISSUES ON COUNTY, STATE, REGIONAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVELS.  ANIMAL PRODUCTION THIS PLAN OF WORK WILL EXPLORE DIFFERENT AREAS OF ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND PROTECTION, FOCUSING ON THE PRODUCTION OF SHEEP, GOATS, DAIRY AND BEEF CATTLE, SWINE, POULTRY, AQUACULTURE, AND SMALL RUMINANTS.

MAJOR COMPONENTS IN THE PLANNED PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TARGET YOUTH AND FAMILIES AT RISK. OTHER COMPONENTS TARGET SMALL PRODUCERS, LIMITED RESOURCES FARMERS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. II. MERIT / PEER REVIEW PROCESS UGA CAES AND FVSU INDEPENDENTLY AND COLLABORATIVELY CONDUCT PERIODIC, EXTENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS OF THEIR RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS. THESE REVIEWS COLLECT BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INPUT, INCLUDING INPUT FROM FACULTY AND STAFF, CLIENTELE, ALUMNI AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. THE RESULTS OF THESE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN USED TO FORMULATE THIS PLAN OF WORK. ADDITIONALLY, THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE SOUGHT GUIDANCE FROM THE UGA CAES ADVISORY SYSTEM AND THE FVSU CAFST ADVISORY BOARD THROUGH THEIR CRITICAL REVIEW OF PROGRAMS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.  THIS PLAN OF WORK IS UNDER CONTINUOUS REVIEW BY THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TEAM, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT SPECIALISTS AND COORDINATORS FROM AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES AND 4- H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS FACULTY FROM BOTH FVSU AND UGA. THIS REVIEW IS AN ONGOING PROCESS, AND FUTURE ANNUAL REVIEWS AND CHANGES TO THE PLAN OF WORK WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS TEAM.  THE RESEARCH PORTION OF THE PLAN OF WORK UNDERGOES SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PRIOR TO EACH PROJECT BEING SUBMITTED. ALL SCIENTISTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ACTIVE PROJECTS FOR EXPENDITURES TO BE MADE. EACH PROJECT IS PEER-REVIEWED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL REVIEWERS AND MUST BE APPROVED BY THE APPROPRIATE DEAN AND DIRECTOR PRIOR TO SUBMISSION TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE.  III. STAKEHOLDER INPUT 1. ACTIONS TO SEEK SURVEYS ARE USED AT THE PLANNED PROGRAM LEVEL. INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND SHARED AS PARTOF THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE ADVISORY SYSTEM REQUIRES THAT FACULTY SEEK PARTICIPATION BY NONTRADITIONAL STAKEHOLDER INDIVIDUALS. GEORGIA'S ADVISORY SYSTEM ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF THE COMMUNITY.  2. METHODS TO IDENTIFY FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION IDENTIFY ORGANIZATIONS MADE UP OF DIRECT STAKEHOLDERS OR POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS IN ADDRESSING COMMUNITY ISSUES. INPUT IS SOUGHT FROM STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR DEDICATION TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COLLEGE. COUNTY PROGRAMS IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WITH THE ABILITY TO REPRESENT DIVERSE CURRENT OR POTENTIAL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY. RACE, ETHNICITY, INCOME OR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST MAY BE USED TO IDENTIFY THESE GROUPS.  3. METHODS TO COLLECT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, ADVISORY COMMITTEES MEET BY PROGRAM AREA TO CUMULATIVELY IDENTIFY ISSUES; PLAN, EXECUTE AND EVALUATE PROGRAMS; AND COMMUNICATE RESULTS TO THE COMMUNITY.  WHEN MAKING HIRING DECISIONS, COMMENTSAND RECOMMENDATIONS OF ACTIVE STAKEHOLDERS ARE SOLICITED VIA EMAIL SURVEY. 4. HOW CONSIDERED STAKEHOLDER INPUT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF GEORGIA'S PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MODEL. STAKEHOLDER INPUT IS CURRENTLY USED FOR PROGRAM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES, AND TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE RESOURCE LEVELS DIRECTED TOWARD SPECIFIC PLANNED PROGRAMS. STAKEHOLDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AS A TOOL TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE AND SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM. STAKEHOLDERS ARE ALSO PART OF FUND DEVELOPMENT AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS.  IV. CRITICAL ISSUES 1 ANIMAL PRODUCTION THIS CRITICAL ISSUE INTEGRATES WORK TO IMPROVE ANIMAL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS INCLUDING POULTRY, BEEF, DAIRY, PORK, SHEEP, GOAT, LAMB, EQUINE, AQUACULTURE, AND POLLINATORS FOR FOOD, FIBER, AND LEISURE. THIS PROGRAM WORKS TO DEVELOP PRODUCTION SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROFITABLE AS WELL AS SUSTAINABLE, AND WORKS CLOSELY WITH SUSTAINABILITY CONSERVATION <(>&<)> ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS HEALTH AND WELLNESS, TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS. THE KEY ASPECT OF THIS PLANNED PROGRAM AREA IS INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK TO SOLVE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS.  THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL AREAS: EFFICIENT PRODUCTION SYSTEMS ANIMAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND MARKETING OF ANIMAL PRODUCTION  2 COMMUNITY, HOME AND LIFE SKILLS WITHIN THIS PROGRAM, FACULTY MEMBERS DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL CAPABILITY FOR GEORGIANS AT EVERY AGE AND STAGE OF THE LIFE CYCLE. FOCUSES INCLUDE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ACCESS TO SERVICES IN THE AREAS OF EARNING (I.E., EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS, INCOME TAXES, JOB SEARCH/SELECTION PROCESS), SPENDING (I.E., BUDGETING, MANAGING EXPENSES, HOME OWNERSHIP), S AVING/INVESTING, BORROWING, AND PROTECTING WHAT'S YOURS (INSURANCE, ESTATE PLANNING, HEALTHY HOMES).  3 FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY CDC ESTIMATES EACH YEAR ROUGHLY 1 OUT OF 6 AMERICANS (48 MILLION) GETS SICK, 128,000 ARE HOSPITALIZED, AND 3,000 DIE FROM FOODBORNE DISEASES. IN RECENTYEARS, GEORGIA HAD THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF SALMONELLOSIS OF ALL 10 SITES MONITORED BY CDC'S FOODNET SYSTEM. INFANTS, YOUNG CHILDREN, THE ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE MOST AT RISK OF SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. EDUCATION FOR FOOD PRODUCERS AND PROCESSERS, FARMERS, ENTREPRENEURS, FARMERS MARKETS, FOODSERVICE AND CONSUMERS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE A SAFE FOOD SUPPLY AND REDUCE INCIDENCE OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS.  THIS PLAN WILL PROVIDE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION/INSTRUCTION RELATED TO: A) PROCESSED FOODS, B) FRUITS, VEGETABLES <(>&<)> NUTS, C) MEAT, POULTRY <(>&<)> SEAFOOD, D) LOCAL FOODS, E) IMPORTED FOODS.   4 HEALTH <(>&<)> WELLNESS THE UGA EXTENSION HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM PROVIDES UP TO DATE, RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. EXTENSION SPECIALISTS TRAIN AGENTS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO ADULTS AND YOUTH ON HEALTH AND WELLNESS. SPECIALISTS ALSO DEVELOP CURRICULA, PRINT MEDIA AND ONLINE CONSUMER RESOURCES, AND PROGRAM EVALUATIONS. 4-H AND FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES FACULTY DEVELOP IN-SCHOOL AND OUT OF SCHOOL PROGRAMMING TO STIMULATE BEHAVIOR CHANGES AMONG YOUTH. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS ISSUE IS BIO-MEDICAL RESEARCH. 5 PLANT PRODUCTION PROJECTS UNDER THE PLANT PRODUCTION PROGRAM ENCOMPASS A BROAD ARRAY OF TARGETED FIELDS OF STUDY THAT INCLUDE ENTOMOLOGY, PLANT PATHOLOGY, NEMATOLOGY, PLANT BREEDING AND GENETICS, SOIL SCIENCE, POSTHARVEST PHYSIOLOGY <(>&<)> STORAGE, IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AGRICULTURAL (MICRO- AND MACRO-) ECONOMICS, SOCIOECONOMICS, FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGICAL SCIENCES, AND RESOURCE SUSTAINABILITY. MANY OF THESE PROJECTS ARE CROSS-DISCIPLINARY AND COMMODITY-DRIVEN WITH THE GOALS OF IMPROVING A GIVEN CROP'S RESOURCE- USE EFFICIENCY, SUSTAINABILITY, PROFITABILITY, YIELDS, AND WORKER SAFETY WHILE REDUCING CROP LOSSES DUE TO ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC STRESS. 6 SUSTAINABILITY, CONSERVATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT THIS CRITICAL ISSUE INTEGRATES WORK FROM THE ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND PLANT PRODUCTION TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE THE FOOD, FIBER NEEDED WITHOUT DESTROYING THE ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH WE DEPEND. THIS PROGRAM WORKS TO DEVELOP PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION THAT ARE PROFITABLE AS WELL AS SUSTAINABLE, AND WORKS CLOSELY WITH FOOD SAFETY AS WELL AS HEALTH AND WELLNESS TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS. THE KEY ASPECT OF THIS PLANNED PROGRAM AREA IS INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK TO SOLVE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS. THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL AREAS: SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTION BIODIVERSITY ON-FARM AND IN THE LANDSCAPE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND VALUE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION 7 URBAN AGRICULTURE URBAN AGRICULTURE POSES UNIQUE CHALLENGES AS AN INCREASINGLY- URBANIZED GEORGIA POPULATION LIVING IN A FINITE AREA WITH FINITE RESOURCES. IN GEORGIA, THE POPULATION IN URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS CONTINUES TO INCREASE WHILE PUTTING ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES. AS POPULATIONS GROW, THE NEEDS FOR URBAN AGRICULTURE PROGRAMMING GROW AS WELL. MEETING THE NEEDS OF THESE CLIENTS IS THE GOAL OF THE URBAN AGRICULTURE CRITICAL ISSUE. INCLUDED IN THIS ISSUE ARE CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE, TURF, AND ORNAMENTAL PLANTS. 8 YOUTH <(>&<)> FAMILY DEVELOPMENT THE YOUTH AND FAMILY DEVELOPMENT CRITICAL ISSUE PROVIDES UP-TO-DATE, RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN FORMING ATTITUDES, ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE, AND DEVELOPING LIFE SKILLS THAT WILL ASSIST THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFESPAN TO BE SELF-DIRECTING, PRODUCTIVE, AND CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "41978dcd-498c-8ab8-89bf-c6abd4f48389-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23HMFPXXXXG041_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736204, "Award ID": "NI23HMFPXXXXG040", "Award Amount": 2246685.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.203", "Description": "CAPACITY GRANT OPPORTUNITY: THE HATCH ACT OF 1887 - MULTISTATE RESEARCH FUND FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: USDA-NIFA-10203-HMFPXXXX-23-0001 ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE STRESSORS, RAPIDLY EVOLVING PESTS AND PATHOGENS, WATER LIMITATIONS AND A DIVERSE ARRAY OF CROP PLANTS AND GROWING ENVIRONMENTS CHALLENGE SCIENTISTS TO ADVANCE TOOLS AND BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS IN THE WESTERN US. WSU SCIENTISTS DEVELOP TOOLS THAT HELP BREEDERS DEVELOP CROP CULTIVARS AND ANIMAL BREEDS THAT ARE WELL ADAPTED TO OUR MANY PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING AND CHARACTERIZING PLANT GERMPLASM AND AS SOURCES OF TRAITS, SUCH AS RESISTANCE TO HEAT, DROUGHT, PESTS AND DISEASES AS WELL AS IMPROVED NUTRITIONAL VALUE. CROP IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS ALSO INCLUDE IMPROVED ROOTSTOCKS THAT HELP OPTIMIZE PERENNIAL PLANTS' VIGOR, PEST RESISTANCE OR WATER UTILIZATION. WSU SCIENTISTS ALSO DEVELOP PHENOMIC TOOLS TO ASSIST EVALUATION OF BREEDING LINES AND FUNDAMENTAL MOLECULAR APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC PERFORMANCE OR VALUABLE METABOLITES LIKE SPECIALTY OILS. SIMILARLY, WSU ANIMAL SCIENTISTS DEVELOP AND USE CELL CULTURE TECHNIQUES IN FISH AND CATTLE TO STUDY MUSCLE DEVELOPMENT FOR GENETIC IMPROVEMENT. SINCE GENOMIC TECHNIQUES ARE NOW USED IN BOTH CROP PLANT AND ANIMAL IMPROVEMENT, A MAJOR RESEARCH EMPHASIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENOMIC TOOLS THAT ASSIST IN THE MANIPULATION OF GENES CONTROLLING TRAITS LIKE RESISTANCE TO BOVINE RESPIRATORY DISEASES OR MUSCLE DEVELOPMENT IN FISH. GENOMIC RESOURCES FOR PLANT AND ANIMAL IMPROVEMENT, LIKE ANNOTATED GENOME ASSEMBLIES, GENOTYPING PLATFORMS AND INTEGRATIVE BIOINFORMATICS TOOLS ARE INCORPORATED INTO LARGE PUBLIC DATABASES FOR SHARING WITH THE PUBLIC AND EASY ACCESS TO BREEDERS. WSU SCIENTISTS USE INTEGRATED APPROACHES TO CONTROL DISEASES, WEEDS, AND OTHER PESTS BY UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND ECOLOGY OF THESE PESTS ALONG WITH POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL SPECIES. FOR EXAMPLE, BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN INSECTS IS MANAGED BY RESEARCHING THE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC PESTICIDES ON PESTS AND BENEFICIAL PREDATORS. SOIL MICROBIAL ECOLOGY IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE SOIL HEALTH ANALYSES WE ARE PERFORMING ACROSS THE STATE. SOIL HEALTH RESEARCH ALSO INCLUDES THE BREAKDOWN OF CONVENTIONAL AND BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS IN SOILS. RESEARCH BY WSU FOOD ENGINEERS IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING SAFE, HIGH-QUALITY, NUTRITIOUS, AND HEALTHY FOOD PRODUCTS WITH LITTLE WASTE. RESEARCH EFFORTS IN HONEY-BEE HEALTH INCLUDE THE USE OF NOVEL GERMPLASM FROM OLD WORLD POPULATIONS IN A BEE BREEDING PROGRAM, DEVELOPMENT OF CONTROL MATERIALS (FUNGI) FOR PARASITIC HONEY-BEE MITES, AND INDOOR STORAGE CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE OVERWINTERING AND REDUCE PARASITIC MITE POPULATIONS. OPTIMIZING WATER AND OTHER INPUTS IN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS ON A SMALL SPECIAL SCALE IS CRITICAL TO BOTH ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL SU STAINABILITY, AS IS REDUCING FARM LABOR. WSU SCIENTISTS ARE INTEGRATING SENSORS THAT CAN MONITOR CROP AND SOIL WATER, FERTILITY, TEMPERATURE, CROP LOAD AND OTHER FACTORS AS WELL AS DEVELOPING ASSISTIVE MECHANIZATION AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR SPECIALTY CROPS. HORTI CULTURALISTS WORK WITH ENGINEERS AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS TO INTEGRATE SENSOR DATA AND MECHANIZATION INTO THE DIVERSE ARCHITECTURE OF SPECIALTY CROP VINEYARDS, ORCHARDS AND FIELDS. IN ADDITION TO CONSERVATION, WATER RESEARCH AT WSU FOCUSES ON AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM IMPR OVEMENT, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT INVOLVING AGRICULTURAL AND ENERGY PRODUCTION, DROUGHT AND FLOOD PREVENTION, AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL OUTCOMES. THEIR RESEARCH GENERATES INFORMATION ON HOW POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY ARE DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TOWARD DECISIONS ON WATER ALLOCATION TO COMPETING USES CONCERNED WITH AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND COMMUNITY VIABILITY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "947e1206-493b-234a-ae92-ccd4d15bae0b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23HMFPXXXXG040_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736012, "Award ID": "NI23HMFPXXXXG039", "Award Amount": 207118.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.203", "Description": "UAF AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY EXPERIMENT STATION: HATCH MULTISTATE RESEARCH CAPACITY GRANT ABSTRACT ALASKA IS RECOGNIZED FOR ITS IMMENSE SIZE, DISPERSED POPULATION AND ITS CULTURAL, GEOGRAPHIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIVERSITY. THE STATE REPRESENTS A MAJOR REGION OF RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES. ITS 365 MILLION ACRES INCLUDE THE NATION'S LARGEST OIL RESERVES, COAL DEPOSITS AND THE TWO LARGEST NATIONAL FORESTS. THE STATE CONTAINS THE LARGEST TERRESTRIAL BIOME ON EARTH - THE BOREAL FOREST - THAT IT SHARES WITH OTHER NORTHERN LOCATIONS. ALASKA HAS A VARIED GEOGRAPHY THAT OFFERS SOILS FOR PRODUCTION OF FOOD, FIBER AND BIOMASS FUELS AS WELL AS FOR A MULTITUDE OF RECREATIONAL AND TOURISM ACTIVITIES. ALASKA'S NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY, THOUGH RESOURCE INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY EXTRACTIVE IN NATURE. ALASKA'S ECONOMY HAS BECOME DEPENDENT UPON REVENUES RELATED TO PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT. TO DIVERSIFY ITS ECONOMY, THE STATE IS EXPANDING AND EXAMINING POTENTIAL IN MOVING TOWARD NON-PETROLEUM NATURAL RESOURCES FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COST-EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE. THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS A PREDOMINANT FORCE IN THE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF ANY TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS (UAF) IN GENERAL AND AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY EXPERIMENT STATION (AFES), IN PARTICULAR, MEET THE CHALLENGES OF INCREASING DEMANDS FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT ARE RELEVANT TO SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF ALASKA'S RESOURCES AND BRING COMMUNITY IDEAS TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE'S RESOURCES. WHILE ALASKA IMPORTS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FOODS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, GROWERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PRODUCE FRESH MARKET POTATOES, VEGETABLES AND HERBS; FORAGES, GRAINS AND MANUFACTURED LIVESTOCK FEEDS; CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDE BEDDING PLANTS, FLORALS, LANDSCAPE ORNAMENTALS AND SHORT SEASON VEGETABLES; AND A VARIETY OF NICHE MARKET CROPS. LIVESTOCK ENTERPRISES IN ALASKA ARE VARIED IN SIZE AND SPECIES OF ANIMAL IN PRODUCTION. PRODUCERS NEED INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO NORTHERN LATITUDES THAT WILL PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE AN ABUNDANT AND SAFE FOOD SUPPLY. AS THE POPULATION GROWS, MORE LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY PRODUCED FOOD WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE GREATER FOOD SECURITY. MANY ALASKANS LIVE A SUBSISTENCE LIFESTYLE OR SUPPLEMENT THEIR DIETS WITH FISH AND GAME MEAT. HIGH ENERGY COSTS REMAIN A CRITICAL ISSUE, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL ALASKA, WHERE FUEL OIL CAN COST DOUBLE AND GASOLINE CAN COST TRIPLE THE AVERAGE PRICE PER GALLON COMPARED TO URBAN AREAS. RESEARCH WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON NEW AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY, WOOD AND BIOMASS AND ENERGY CONSERVATION. AFES WILL WORK TO PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION TO MANAGE RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY FOR ENHANCING THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE AT HIGH LATITUDES. RESEARCH WILL ALSO FOCUS ON THE HEALTH OF OUR LARGEST FOREST BIOME, INCLUDING UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE, INSECT INFESTATION, AND LAND USE. ECOLOGICAL DROUGHT IS IMPACTING FOREST FIRE THREAT AND BARK BEETLE INFESTATION, WHICH IS DAMAGING FOREST NATURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR TOURISM, FIREWOOD AVAILABILITY, AND INCREASED FIRE RISK. WHILE FORESTERS, FARMERS AND LAND MANAGERS USE RESEARCH RESULTS, ALL ALASKANS BENEFIT FROM THE WISE USE OF LAND RESOURCES. RESEARCH PROJECTS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM PRODUCERS, INDUSTRIES, AND STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR INFORMATION ON PLANT, ANIMAL AND SOIL SCIENCES, FOREST SCIENCES AND RESOURCES MANAGEMENT. AFES PRIORITIES, LIKE NATIONAL PRIORITIES, ARE TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABILITY OF FOOD, FOREST, AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS; ADAPT TO AND MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE; SUPPORT ENERGY SECURITY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES; ENSURE A SAFE, SECURE AND ABUNDANT FOOD SUPPLY; STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; AND SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND RESILIENCE. EXPERIMENT STATION RESEARCHERS WILL CONTINUE TO PUBLISH RESEARCH IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, BOOKS, AND IN EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETINS, CIRCULARS, NEWSLETTERS, RESEARCH PROGRESS REPORTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PUBLICATIONS. SCIENTISTS WILL ALSO DISSEMINATE THEIR FINDINGS THROUGH CONFERENCES, PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS, WORKSHOPS AND OTHER PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS LIKE WEBSITES AND BLOGS. AGRICULTURE <(>&<)> FOOD SECURITY: ALASKA IMPORTS OVER 90 PERCENT OF FOODS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CONSUMED IN THE STATE. GROWERS' PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY FOR IN-STATE CONSUMPTION AND USE, INCLUDING FRESH MARKET POTATOES, FORAGES, GRAINS AND OTHER LIVESTOCK FEEDS, GREENHOUSE FLOWERS AND VEGETABLES AND A VARIETY OF \"NICHE MARKET\" CROPS AND PRODUCTS. COMMERCIAL HORTICULTURE INCLUDES ORNAMENTALS, GREENHOUSE OPERATIONS, TURF MANAGEMENT, LAWN MAINTENANCE AND SOD PRODUCTION. PROPER KNOWLEDGE AND PLANNING OF SOIL-DISTURBING ACTIVITIES CAN PREVENT MAJOR IMPACTS ON OTHER RESOURCES. ANIMAL ENTERPRISES IN ALASKA INCLUDE DAIRY, BEEF, SWINE, REINDEER, POULTRY AND NONTRADITIONAL LIVESTOCK SUCH AS MUSKOX, ELK AND BISON. AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND OUTREACH WILL ADDRESS AREAS OF ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, HOME ANIMAL PRODUCTION, AGRONOMIC CROPS INCLUDING OIL SEEDS AND COVER CROPS, AND HOME AND COMMERCIAL VEGETABLE PRODUCTION. AGRICULTURAL SOILS, FERTILIZER AND COMPOST RESEARCH AND OUTREACH ARE ALSO PART OF THIS PROGRAM AREA. AGRICULTURE RESEARCH INCLUDES THE PRIMARY AREAS OF ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HEALTH, HORTICULTURE, SOIL SCIENCE, AND AGROFORESTRY. AS ALASKA EXPANDS ITS IN-STATE CONSUMPTION AND EXPORT MARKETS, PRODUCERS WILL REQUIRE INCREASING ACCESS TO RESEARCH-DERIVED INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO NORTHERN-LATITUDE ENVIRONMENTS AND KNOWLEDGE APPLIED FROM RESEARCH IN OTHER STATES. HATCH MULTISTATE PROJECT PARTICIPATION CONNECTS AFES RESEARCHERS AND PROJECTS IN ALASKA WITH AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AROUND THE COUNTRY TO INFORM OUTREACH REGARDING SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION PRACTICES TO ULTIMATELY IMPROVE FOOD PRODUCTION IN ALASKA. AFES USES SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND PUBLICATIONS. AFES COMPLIES WITH THE AMENDMENT TO THE HATCH ACT OF 1887 TO SECTION 104 BY AREERA FOR PROGRAMS FUNDED UNDER SECTION 3(C)(3) OF THE HATCH ACT (HATCH MULTISTATE RESEARCH FUNDS) BY USING ITS ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC REVIEW PROCESS FOR ALL PROPOSALS AND PUBLICATIONS. FOR HATCH MULTISTATE, THE PI IDENTIFIES A PROJECT THAT THEY WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN, AND SUBMITS THE REQUEST FOR AFES DIRECTOR APPROVAL. THE DIRECTOR SIGNS THE APPENDIX E IN NIMSS AND THE PI WORKS WITH THE SITE ADMINISTRATOR TO ENTER PROJECT PARTICIPATION IN THE RELEVANT DATABASES. EACH PI ALSO SUBMITS PROJECTED BUDGETS THAT INCLUDE EXPECTED COSTS FOR RESEARCH, OUTREACH, AND TRAVEL TO THE MULTISTATE MEETINGS. AFES WILL MEET WITH AUDIENCES ON DEMAND THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL SETTINGS EACH YEAR. EXAMPLES OF THESE AUDIENCES INCLUDE AGRICULTURE ASSOCIATIONS, LIVESTOCK ASSOCIATIONS AND REINDEER HERDERS, ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGES, TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS AND REGIONAL CORPORATIONS, BOROUGH AND CITY GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPALITIES, GROWER GROUPS MEETING AT REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE CONFERENCES, INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN FOOD, FIBER AND FUEL/ENERGY PRODUCTION, TRIBAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICTS (TSWCDS) AND SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICTS (SWCDS), AND STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME, ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE), USDA, NRCS, AND THE FOREST SERVICE. AFES PLAN TO ENGAGE WITH ADVISORY COMMITTEES, FOCUS GROUPS AND PARTICIPANTS IN LISTENING SESSIONS AS WELL AS CONTINUE TO CONDUCT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND STAKEHOLDER SURVEYS AS METHODS TO IDENTIFY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS FROM WHOM TO COLLECT INPUT. FACULTY AND STAFF WILL UTILIZE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU DATA TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL AUDIENCES AND PARITY GOALS. AFES RELIES ON STAKEHOLDER INPUT FROM AGRICULTURAL ADVISORY GROUPS, COLLABORATORS, FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, COLLEAGUES, FACULTY AND STUDENTS FOR ASSISTANCE IN ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES AND DEVELOPING PROJECT DIRECTIONS. AFES WILL CONTINUE GENERATING A FEEDBACK LOOP THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION TO RESEARCH AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS AND FROM RESEARCH AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO STAKEHOLDERS AND INDIVIDUALS. CONFERENCES, MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS ARE SCHEDULED AROUND THEMES RELEVANT TO STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS. POST-ACTIVITY SURVEYS AND DEBRIEFING OPPORTUNITIES WILL ESTABLISH HOW WELL INFORMATION NEEDS ARE ADDRESSED. MEETING MINUTES, VIDEOCONFERENCE ARCHIVES AND OTHER RECORDS OF STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND INPUT WILL BE USED IN PLANNING OF RESEARCH. STAKEHOLDER INPUT WILL BE CONSIDERED IN PROGRAM PLANNING TO: IDENTIFY EMERGING ISSUES; REDIRECT EXTENSION AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS; GUIDE STAFF HIRING AND ACTION PLANS; SET DISTRICT AND UNIT-WIDE PRIORITIES; AND IDENTIFY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. AFES WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ALASKA. INPUT WILL REFLECT IDEAS AND ADVICE GIVEN BY CLIENT USER GROUPS, STUDENTS, EXPERT ADVISORS, STATE AND NATIONAL PEERS AND COLLABORATORS AND UAF ADMINISTRATION. NEEDS ASSESSMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO HELP AFES FACULTY AND STAFF IDENTIFY EMERGING ISSUES.

OAES IS OREGON'S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE RELATING TO AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SYSTEMS, AND A MAJOR SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, NATURAL RESOURCES, LIFE SCIENCES, AND RURAL ECONOMIES AND COMMUNITIES WORLDWIDE. OSUES WORKS TO USE RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION TO CREATE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON COMMUNITY LIVABILITY, ECONOMIC VITALITY, AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES SUSTAINABILITY, AND THE HEALTH AND WELL- BEING OF PEOPLE. PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY OAES AND OSUES ARE COMPLEMENTARY AND CROSS DISCIPLINARY LINES TO MORE FULLY ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES AT THELOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES' OAES OFFICE REFLECTS THESE VALUES: VALUE 1: RESPONSIVENESS - WE REACT IN A TIMELY FASHION TO THE NEEDS OF THOSE WE SERVE; VALUE 2: PARTNERSHIP AND COOPERATION - WE COLLABORATE WITH INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESSES, AND AGENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY; VALUE 3: TEAMWORK AND COORDINATION - WE SYNCHRONIZE OUR EFFORTS AMONG OUR UNITS AND WITH OTHER UNITS AT THE UNIVERSITY; VALUE 4: CREDIBILITY - WE FOCUS ON BEING KNOWN AS A SOURCE OF RELIABLE, OBJECTIVE, RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION AND EDUCATION. THE CORE VALUES AND OPERATING PRINCIPLES OF OSUES ARE: VALUE 1: COMMUNITY-BASED - WE VALUE COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS AND CONNECT OSU TO LOCAL PEOPLE AND ISSUES TO ENHANCE THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE OF THE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES OF OREGON. VALUE 2: ACCOUNTABILITY - WE FOCUS ON ACHIEVING MEASURABLE OUTCOMES, AND DOCUMENT AND COMMUNICATE THE IMPACT AND VALUE OF OUR WORK. VALUE 3: CREDIBILITY - WE DELIVER RELEVANT, RESEARCH-BASED KNOWLEDGE THROUGH OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. VALUE 4: DIVERSITY - WE EXHIBIT RESPECT, VALUE DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS AND WORLD VIEWS, AND ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY. VALUE 5: PARTNERSHIPS - WE COLLABORATE WITH ACADEMIC, PUBLIC, AND PRIVATE PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE GREATER RESULTS AND BUILD COMMUNITY CA PACITY. WE VALUE THE PUBLIC GOOD THAT COMES FROM COLLABORATING WITH VOLUNTEERS. VALUE 6: RESPONSIVENESS - WE ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY ISSUES AND NEEDS, TO DESIGN TIMELY RESPONSES, AND TO BUILD FUTURE CAPABILITY. TO CARRY OUT ITS MISSION IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH UNIVERSITY GOALS, OAES USES ITS RESOURCES TO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS OF EMPHASIS: 1) NEW VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS AND MARKETS THAT LEVERAGE THE ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF OREGON AGRICULTURE. 2) NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND POLICY THROUGH DISCOVERY AND LEARNING TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDSCAPES AS A SYSTEM. 3) INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT HELP ASSURE ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE, ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND RESILIENT AGRICULTURE. THE OSUES GOALS FOR ADVANCING THE ORGANIZATION'S MISSION TO ALIGN WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S STRATEGIC PLANS INCLUDE: GOAL 1: IMPROVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY LEARNER SERVICES - EXTENSION PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE KNOWLEDGE RESOURCES OF OSU BY BEING FOCUSED AND NIMBLE IN ENGAGING OREGON'S DIVERSE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES IN HIGH-QUALITY LEANER SERVICES THAT HELP BUILD SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY FUTURES. GOAL 2: INVEST FOR EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT - EXTENSION WORKS TO INCREASE AND DIVERSITY ITS FUNDING BASE AND ENCOURAGE PROGRAM EXCELLENCE THROUGH STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS WITHIN FOUR THEMATIC AREAS: HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMIES; RESILIENT AND PRODUCTIVE FORESTRY AND NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS; SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, FOOD SYSTEMS, AND GARDENING; THRIVING YOUTH, INDIVIDUALS, AND FAMILIES. THIS WILL CREATE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS THAT WILL BE REPORTED WIDELY TO STAKEHOLDERS. GOAL 3: INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS WITH APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY - EXTENSION USES ESTABLISHED AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES STRATEGICALLY TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES, EXPAND OUTREACH AND ENHANCE AND REPORT THE OUTCOMES OF ITS EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. THE AES STATION UNITS ACROSS THE STATE, UTILIZE INPUT FROM AFFILIATED ADVISORY COMMITTEES, FROM FACULTY RESEARCH EXPERTS, LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING FARMERS AND RANCHERS, FORESTERS, AGENCY PERSONNEL, ELECTED LEADERS, EDUCATORS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND MYRIAD OTHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES TO ESTABLISH NEED AND DESIGN APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING. IN MANY CASES, STAKEHOLDERS ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAMMING AS VOLUNTEERS OR BY PERMITTING DEMONSTRATIONS AND APPLIED RESEARCH TRIALS ON THEIR PROPERTIES. WE RECENTLY AUGMENTED OUR ABILITIES TO CONNECT WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS DIVERSE INTEREST AREAS AND TO GAIN ADVICE REGARDING FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES FOR THE PEOPLE OF OREGON WITH THE FORMATION OF A RESEARCH COMMUNITY ADVISORY NETWORK (RCAN) TO PROVIDE INPUT TO THE OAES ON CURRENT AND FUTURERESEARCH NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY, FACULTY MEMBERS UTILIZE CRITICAL DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC DATA, AND EXAMINE CURRENT RESEARCH FINDINGS TO IDENTIFY SOCIETAL NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS. PROGRAMMING IS THEN PLANNED BASED ON INPUT WITHIN OAES, EXTERNAL ADVISORY GROUPS, AND IN EACH OTHER ACADEMIC COLLEGES/PROGRAMS (I.E. FORESTRY, AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES, HEALTH AND HUMAN SCIENCES) AND ASSOCIATED EXTENSION PROGRAMS. INPUT IS SOLICITED BY OSUES THROUGH A STATEWIDE ADVISORY NETWORK KNOWN AS EXTENSION COMMUNITY ADVISORY NETWORK (ECAN) THAT DIRECTLY ADVISES THE VICE PROVOST FOR EXTENSION AND ENGAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR OF EXTENSION. THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING EACH OF OSUES'S SEVEN PROGRAM AREAS (4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH, FORESTRY AND NATURAL RESOURCES, OPEN CAMPUS, OUTDOOR SCHOOL, AND SEA GRANT) AS WELL AS TWO COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM OREGON COUNTIES AS DETERMINED BY THE OSUES DIRECTOR. PLANNED OUTCOMES DEVELOPED FROM THIS PROCESS ARE OUTLINED IN A BIENNIAL PLAN SUBMITTED BY EACH PARTICIPATING COLLEGE. OAES PROJECTS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY ON THE BASIS OF PLANNED OUTCOMES OUTLINED IN A FIVE-YEAR, PEER REVIEWED PROPOSAL SUBMITTED TO OAES AND APPROVED BY NIFA. PROJECT OUTCOMES ARE ALSO ASSESSED AGAINST THE AES'S INTERNAL STRATEGIC INTENT DOCUMENT, A STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE FORMULATED WITH INPUT FROM INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. OAES HAS IDENTIFIED FOUR CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED UNDER THE POW: 1) MARINE CONSERVATION AND FOOD SYSTEMS, 2) AGRICULTURAL COMPETITIVENESS AND RESILIENCE, 3) MARKETS AND ACCESS IN FOOD AND HEALTH INNOVATIONS, AND 4) WORKING AND NATURAL LANDSCAPES. THESE FOUR \"THEMES\" WILL DRIVE THE RESEARCH AND OUTREACH EFFORTS OF THE COLLEGE OVER THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE STRATEGIC CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED BY NIFA, WHICH TARGETED SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, CLIMATE CHANGE, GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY/HUNGER, FOOD SAFETY, AND OBESITY ARE EVIDENT ACROSS THE PLAN. AN ADDITIONAL CRITICAL ISSUE- ANIMAL HEALTH - HAS BEEN ADDED TO ADDRESS CAPACITY FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE RESEARCH AS WELL AS OTHER COMPETITIVE GRANT FUNDING. THE CONNECTIVELY AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE OAES AND OSUES AND THE OVERLAP IN THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITIES WE SERVE ULTIMATELY COMBINES TO RESULT IN ACCESS TO RESEARCH-BASED KNOWLEDGE AND EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING THAT DELIVERS RESEARCH-BASED SOLUTIONS FOR CONTEMPORARY ISSUES TO ENABLE RESILIENCE IN AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND IMPROVED LIVELIHOODS FOR THE PEOPLE OF OREGON.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "a560dc75-2cd0-baf4-415b-f60d20ba8491-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23HMFPXXXXG038_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736156, "Award ID": "NI23HMFPXXXXG037", "Award Amount": 543741.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.203", "Description": "AGRICULTURE IN DELAWARE REMAINS STRONG TODAY, WITH THE DELMARVA BROILER INDUSTRY BEING THE LARGEST AGRICULTURE COMMODITY. THE STATE HAS 490,000 ACRES OF CROPLAND (45% IRRIGATED) THAT PROVIDE THE GRAIN CROPS NEEDED FOR A THRIVING POULTRY INDUSTRY, AN INNOVATIVE AND PROFITABLE FRUIT, AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTION INDUSTRY, AND A \"GREEN INDUSTRY\" THAT SUPPORTS HORTICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE INTERESTS OF ITS CITIZENS. A 2010 REPORT LED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE <(>&<)> NATURAL RESOURCES (\"THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE ON DELAWARE'S ECONOMY\") FOUND THAT THE TOTAL ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION OF ALL CATEGORIES OF AGRICULTURE IN DELAWARE WAS $7.95 BILLION IN INDUSTRY OUTPUT AND THAT THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTED $2.5 BILLION IN VALUE-ADDED ACTIVITY, AND $1.6 BILLION IN LABOR INCOME, SUPPORTING 30,000 JOBS. OUR PLAN OF WORK IS CREATED AND REPORTEDLY JOINTLY WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE AND DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY AND OUR INTENTION IS TO PROVIDE RESEARCH-BASED SOLUTIONS TO THE COMPLEX, GLOBAL CHALLENGES FACING DELAWARE TODAY. OUR WORK IS DEFINED IN FOUR BROAD CRITICAL ISSUES WITH SEVERAL SUBHEADINGS WITHIN SOME CATEGORIES TO FURTHER DEFINE THE ISSUES. IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO HELP DELAWARE AGRICULTURE REMAIN COMPETITIVE, TO MEET ITS ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, SUSTAIN THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES AND SUPPORT OUR RURAL AND URBAN YOUTH, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. WE FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ISSUE AREAS: 1. SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS FOR AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN LANDSCAPES. WE ARE CONTINUALLY CHALLENGED TO FEED THE WORLD'S GROWING POPULATION. THROUGH RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, WE DEVELOP, AND PROMOTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT MAXIMIZE YIELD, MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY, AND UTILIZE NUTRIENTS, WATER, AND PESTICIDES EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. 2. NUTRITION AND WELLNESS. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH PARTNERS ACROSS THE FOOD SYSTEM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL WAYS TO PROVIDE FOOD ACCESS TO LIMITED RESOURCE AUDIENCES AND TO ALIGN OUR WELL-BEING WORK TO INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH FOR ALL, INCLUDING OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS AS A SPECIFIC AUDIENCE. 3. PERSONAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL WELLBEING OF INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, BUSINESS, AND OUR COMMUNITIES T HROUGHOUT DELAWARE ARE INTER-RELATED AND ARE CONNECTED TO THE BROADER ECONOMIC CONTEXT OF OUR STATE AND NATIONAL ECONOMY. THE WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND ESPECIALLY MINORITIES ARE DETERMINED BY THEIR ACCESS TO JOBS, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNIT IES, AND TRAINING. IN AN ERA WHEN DELAWARE IS LOSING ITS MANUFACTURING BASE, THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY CAN BE A SECTOR TARGETED TO EXPAND ECONOMIC GROWTH. 4. ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. \"ENSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF CLEAN WATER\" WAS \"VERY IMPORTANT\" AND WAS THE HIGH EST-RANKED ISSUE AMONG THE STATE-LEVEL ISSUES THAT WERE CONSIDERED IN A RECENT SURVEY.

THEY WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND COLLABORATIVELY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS IN ALL 95 COUNTIES AND TO SERVE THE STATES 6.9 MILLION PEOPLE. THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE IS BASED IN KNOXVILLE AND SERVES AS THE STATES 1862 INSTITUTION. IT INCLUDES THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT EXTENSION) AND THE TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (UT AGRESEARCH). BASED IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY (TSU) IS THE STATES 1890 INSTITUTION; IT INCLUDES THE TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. THIS PLAN OF WORK REPRESENTS THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF UT EXTENSION, UT AGRESEARCH, TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM, AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. AGRICULTURE IS INTEGRAL TO TENNESSEES ECONOMY AND CULTURE. ALMOST ONE OF EVERY EIGHT TO NINE DOLLARS GENERATED IN THE STATEIS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE OR AN INDUSTRY THAT GENERATES PRODUCTS FROM A NATURAL RESOURCE  MORE THAN $79.3 BILLION ANNUALLY. THE STATES AGRICULTURAL AND RELATED EXPORTS TOTALED $2.2 BILLION IN 2021, UP $325 MILLION OR 17% WHEN COMPARED TO 2020. TENNESSEE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN ALL MAJOR COMMODITY CATEGORIES IN 2021. FARM RECEIPTS TOTALED $3.6 BILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 65.5% OF THIS VALUE COMING FROM CROPS AND 34.5% FROM ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC SUCCESSES OF TENNESSEE AGRICULTURE, 339,400 TENNESSEANS ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED BY AGRICULTURAL OR NATURAL RESOURCE INDUSTRIES, MAKING EFFECTIVE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS CRITICAL. TENNESSEES LANDGRANT INSTITUTIONS CONDUCT RESEARCH AND PROVIDE EXTENSION OUTREACH IN FIVE KEY AREAS TO ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THE STATE: SUPPORTING FOOD, FIBER, AND ENERGY SYSTEMS; ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; ENRICHING OUR ECONOMY; DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE; AND STRENGTHENING OUR HEALTH. RESEARCH PROJECTS PROVIDE NEW KNOWLEDGE TO HELP STAKEHOLDERS ADDRESS ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEM. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES SHARE THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ULTIMATELY TO RESULT IN A CHANGE IN ACTION OR CONDITION. EXTENSION WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING NEEDS CITIZENS AND AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS ACROSS THE STATE. HEALTH ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE TOP CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. EXTENSION WILL STRENGTHEN HEALTH PROGRAMMING BY OFFERING THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR IMPROVING DIETARY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR LIMITEDRESOURCE TENNESSEANS. EXTENSION LIVESTOCK AND FORAGE PROGRAMS STRENGTHEN OUR EXTENSION AND RESEARCH FOR THE STATES LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS, RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL WILL JOINTLY IMPLEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH IN HAY SCHOOLS, LATE GESTATION NUTRITION, MARKETING, FORAGE TESTING, AND STOCKPILED FORAGES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION HAS DEVELOPED PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN AND PROVIDE VALUEADDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRODUCERS. THE UT CENTER FOR FARM MANAGEMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS IN 2022. THE CENTER FACILITATES EXTENSION, TEACHING, AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS ON FARM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. THE CENTER WILL FOCUS ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF TENNESSEE PRODUCERS AND ENHANCING LONGTERM PROFITABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURE ENTERPRISES. THROUGH THE CROPS PRODUCTION SYSTEMS EXTENSIONS PROVIDE DEMONSTRATION AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT BENEFITS PRODUCERS. THE CROP VARIETY TRIALS FOR CORN GRAIN, SILAGE, AND SOYBEANS AS WELL AS PRODUCER EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR CORN, SOYBEANS, COTTON, WHEAT, AND TOBACCO PRODUCTION ARE KEY AREAS. THE CONSUMER ECONOMICS PROGRAM HELPS FAMILIES INCREASE SAVINGS, DECREASE DEBT, AND FINANCIALLY PLAN. THE ON MY OWN AND 4H WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED FOR YOUTH AND ADULTS THAT PROVIDE NEEDED SKILLS, TRAININGS, AND EXPERIENCES TO PARTICIPANTS. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OF TOP PRIORITY FOR EXTENSION. EXTENSION CONTINUES DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE AND PROVIDE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE NEXT CHAPTER PROGRAM IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND TENNESSEE 4H. IN CREATING THIS PROGRAM, WE WANT TO CREATE AN EARLY DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT SKILLS ARE NECESSARY FOR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BOTH THEIR SECONDARY AND POSTSECONDARY PLANS. 4H CONTINUES PROGRAMING ON HONING STEM AND CITIZENSHIP/LEADERSHIP SKILLS. UT AGRESEARCH CONDUCTS RESEARCH WITHIN ITS EIGHT ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND SEVEN PHYSICAL CENTERS, AND AT TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS (REC) LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE UNITS HELP DRIVE PLANNED RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND FACILITATE FACULTY RESEARCH PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO A DECADE OF EXCELLENCE: TENYEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR UTIA, 20182028, AGRESEARCH OPERATES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF ITS 20212024 AGRESEARCH STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN WITH THE OBJECTIVES TO BALANCE A PORTFOLIO OF INTEGRATED, INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAMS, CULTIVATE TEAMS TO APPROALF). THE PROGRAM INCORPORATES BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL MANAGEMENT PROJEC TS THAT ULTIMATELY WILL CONTRIBUTE INFORMATION TO REFINE STRATEGIES THAT OFFER CARBON REDUCTIONS OVER TODAY'S AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS. AGRESEARCH IS REALIGNING THE CAPABILITIES AT TWO OF ITS TEN REC TO FACILITATE PLF INITIATIVE. THE LITTLE RIVER ANIMAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT PLANS TO HAVE MILKING ROBOTS IN OPERATION BY LATE FALL 2022, AND THE MIDDLE TENNESSEE REC IS RETOOLING TO SUPPORT PRECISION BEEF AND POULTRY PRODUCTION RESEARCH. ALSO, EXPANDED ACTIVITY IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE WILL RESPOND TO CONCERNS OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION. THE TRANSFORMATIONAL AGRICULTURAL GENOMICS AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY PROGRAM WILL ADVANCE ANIMAL AND PLANT-BASED PRODUCTIVITY. ALTHOUGH EARLY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT, THE INITIATIVE ALREADY ENGAGES FACULTY TO ADVANCE STATE-OF-THE-ART SCIENCE TO DESIGN CROPS THAT ARE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. FINALLY, THE BIOECONOMY ADVANCEMENT INITIATIVE IS AN ESTABLISHED INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABLE FUELS, CHEMICALS, AND MATERIALS. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IS EXPANDING RESEARCH CAPABILITIES IN SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AGGRESSIVE GRAND CHALLENGE GOALS ANNOUNCED BY THE WHITE HOUSE. MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PROCESSES TENNESSEE EXTENSION PROGRAMS FUNDED BY SMITH-LEVER OR NARETPA SECTION 1444 AND 1445 REQUIRE A MERIT REVIEW PROCESS. A PANEL OF EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS, PROGRAM LEADERS AND SCHOLARS FROM FOUR STATES REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TENNESSEE EXTENSION MERIT REVIEW CRITERIA. CRITERIA INCLUDES ASSESSING NEEDS, DELIVERY METHODS, IMPLEMENTATION STEPS, EVALUATION, ENSURING DIVERSITY AND DEFINED OUTCOMES. UT AND TSU COORDINATE MERIT REVIEW PROCESSES. STATE EXTENSION SPECIALISTS PROPOSE PLANNED PROGRAMS. ALL PROPOSED PROGRAMS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY A REVIEW TEAM OF UT EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS AND SPECIALISTS. UT AGRESEARCH WILL UTILIZE THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE IT HAS PROVEN TO BE BOTH EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. HATCH REGULAR AND HATCH/MULTI-STATE RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERGO A REVIEW PROCESS FOR MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS, AND TO ENSURE ALIGNMENT WITH ESTABLISHED RESEARCH PRIORITIES. THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR HATCH REGULAR RESEARCH PROJECTS BEGINS INFORMALLY WITH DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PROJECT DIRECTOR, COLLEAGUES, THE DEPARTMENT HEAD, AND, IF APPLICABLE, AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS (IF FIELD WORK IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT). A REVIEW PANEL OF THREE SCIENTISTS THEN EVALUATES THE PROPOSAL FOR CLARITY, TECHNICAL RELEVANCE, AND SCIENTIFIC MERIT. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR MAKES ANY NECESSARY REVISIONS AND SUBMITS THE PROPOSAL TO THE DEPARTMENT HEAD FOR REVIEW. IF APPROVED, THE DEAN/DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH THEN CONDUCTS A FINAL EVALUATION AND ENDORSES THE PROPOSAL FOR SUBMISSION TO NIFA. HATCH/MULTI-STATE PROJECTS GO THROUGH A COMPARATIVELY MORE EXTENSIVE REVIEW AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL, SO THE INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS IS ABBREVIATED. THE FACULTY MEMBER OFFICIALLY JOINS A MULTI-STATE PROJECT AFTER CONSULTING WITH COLLEAGUES AND, IF APPLICABLE, THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR THEN SUBMITS A PROPOSAL REFLECTING THE UT COMPONENT DIRECTLY TO THE ASSOCIATE DEAN/ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT. ONCE THE REVIEW IS COMPLETE AND ANY NECESSARY CHANGES ARE MADE, THE RESEARCHER SUBMITS THE PROJECT TO NIFA. STAKEHOLDER INPUT UT EXTENSION PURSUED MULTIPLE DATA COLLECTIONS FOR THIS PLAN OF WORK. ALL 95 COUNTIES HAVE LOCAL EXTENSION ADVISORY GROUPS THAT PROVIDE ONGOING STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE UT-TSU EXTENSION STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL REVIEWS AND UPDATES PLANS BI-ANNUALLY. EXTENSIVE STRATEGIC PLAN ACTIVITIES ALSO INFORMED THIS PLAN. EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND STATE AGENCY LEADERS PARTICIPATED IN SURVEYS, LISTENING SESSIONS AND FOCUS GROUPS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW EXTENSION COULD ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. BASED ON THIS INPUT, THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL IDENTIFIED PLAN PRIORITIES. NEW STATE ACTION AGENDAS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS PRIORITIES. PLANS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE PROGRESS AND MAKE CHANGES. UT AGRESEARCH CONTINUES TO SEEK STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THROUGH SEVERAL MEANS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR TO DISCUSS AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES, UTIA PROGRAM PRIOR ITIES, AND HOW UTIA, INCLUDING UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION, MAY RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES. SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE TENNESSEE FARM BUREAU, AND SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE TENNESSEE STATE GOVERNMENT ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF COMMON RESEARCH INTERESTS. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS SERVE THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS AT THE INVITATION OF THE DEPARTMENT HEAD AND CENTER DIRECTOR, RESPECTIVELY, TO PROVIDE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES. FACULTYHELP DRIVE THE UT AGRESEARCH AGENDA BY REMAINING ABREAST OF EMERGING RESEARCH AND ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, PROGRAM LEADERS WITH STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING AGENCIES, THE PUBLIC, AND AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. ADDITIONALLY, THE UT SYSTEM IS COMPLETING A SURVEY THAT WENT STATEWIDE REGARDING PUBLIC INPUT INTO THE GRAND CHALLENGES FACING TENNESSEE. THIS WAS A UT SYSTEM EFFORT, BUT UT EXTENSION AND UT AGRESEARCH ASSISTED IN SHARING THE SURVEY ACROSS TENNESSEE AND THE RESULTS WILL CERTAINLY ADD TO THE INFORMATION WE USE TO DETERMINE DIRECTIONS FOR OUR WORK. UT AND TSU EXTENSION WILL EMPLOY THEIR EXTENSIVE, STATEWIDE NETWORK OF ADVISORY GROUPS FOR STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL PROVIDES INPUT AND DIRECTION FOR STATEWIDE INITIATIVES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION AGENTS WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON INVOLVING YOUTH AND OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES. ALL OF TENNESSEE'S 95 COUNTIES HAVE A COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE OF SEVEN LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, NOMINATED BY THE COUNTY MAYOR AND APPROVED BY MAJORITY VOTE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSION. EVERY COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEETS FOUR TIMES ANNUALLY, AND THEIR DUTIES INCLUDE INPUT INTO HIRING DECISIONS, LOCAL FUNDING, AND LOCAL PROGRAMMING. UT AGRESEARCH IMPLEMENTS SEVERAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS FOR INPUT. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE STATE GOVERNMENT, AND THE COMMUNITY. IT HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP ON RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION ISSUES. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS ARE COMPRISED OF THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE AND DEANS, REPRESENTATIVES FROM TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY GROUPS, AND CLIENTELE SERVED BY UTIA PROGRAMS. UTIA PERSONNEL NOMINATE THE COMMODITY GROUP AND CLIENTELE MEMBERS. EACH OF THE THREE REGIONAL ADVISORY GROUPS ELECTS A CHAIR TO GUIDE MEETINGS. IN ADDITION, UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. AS NEW PRIORITIES ARISE, THESE GROUPS SEEK OUT ONE ANOTHER TO DISCUSS COMMON RESEARCH NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS FOR THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS' AND GROUPS' RELEVANT BACKGROUND, EXPERTISE, AND COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. UT AGRESEARCH FACULTY REGULARLY INTERACT WITH THEIR PEERS AT PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND THROUGH JOINT PROJECT VENTURES. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS ENCOURAGE FACULTY TO MEET WITH PROGRAM LEADERS AT STATE AND NATIONAL FUNDING AGENCIES TO DISCUSS RESEARCH PRIORITIES. ADDITIONALLY, FACULTY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET WITH THE PUBLIC DURING AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER FIELD DAY EVENTS. TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT/TSU) AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS ARE TRAINED IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES AND HOW TO SELECT INDIVIDUALS FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES. COMMUNITY LEADERS SELECTED FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSITIES (I.E., GENDER, AGE, RACIAL/ETHNIC, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, EDUCATIONAL, ETC.) OF THE COUNTY OR AREA SERVED. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE CONDUCTS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR (SPECIFIC TO UT EXTENSION). EXTENSION AGENTS RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PAST AND CURRENT EXTENSION PROGRAMS; AND THEY RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT USED EXTENSION TO SERVE ON LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND PARTICIPATE IN OPEN LISTENING SESSIONS. EXTENSION AGENTS ALSO CONDUCT SURVEYS ON PLANNED PROGRAM AREAS. UT AGRESEARCH COLLECTS INPUT THROUGH REGULAR CONTACT WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE AND THE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR. THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE RESPONDS TO ANY ISSUES RAISED, AND, AS APPROPRIATE, MAY DELEGATE ACTION TO THE DEANS/DIRECTORS OF UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS MEET WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THEY HAVE FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS WITH THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT HEADS AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS WITH THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER DIRECTORS MONTHLY; COLLECTIVELY THEY MEET ONCE PER YEAR. THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS MEET WITH THEIR ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS ANNUALLY AND SHARE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WITH AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY AS APPROPRIATE. FACULTY ATTEND PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND READ SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND POPULAR PRESS ARTICLES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. DEPARTMENTS HOLD MONTHLY FACULTY MEETINGS WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS WITH PEERS AND THEIR DEPARTMENT HEAD. STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES AT LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND STATEWIDE LEVEL MONITOR AND ADJUST DEPLOYMENT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, THE OPINIONS FROM MANY TENNESSEANS, INCLUDING DECISION-MAKERS, CLIENTELE, PARTNERS, AND VOLUNTEERS WERE CONSIDERED. MORE THAN 120 STAKEHOLDERS AND 490 UT EXTENSION EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATED IN THE REGIONAL AND CAMPUS LISTENING SESSIONS. THE PLANNING EFFORT ALSO INCLUDED AN ONLINE SURVEY COMPONENT. UT EXTENSION WILL ADDRESS THE INCREASING URBANIZATION AND A LOSS OF FARMLAND IN THE STATE ARE CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. OUR NURSERY, FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTION PROGRAMS WILL PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON PLANT, PEST, AND SOIL DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES.

THE RESEARCH EXPRESSED IN THE PROGRAM AREAS IS THE RESULT OF COOPERATION AMONG RESEARCHERS AT VARIOUS LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS. IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS ARE ENGAGED IN PROJECTS THAT IMPACT FOOD-ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION, CROP MANAGEMENT AND DISEASE MITIGATION, ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, HUMAN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, AND INFLUENCES AND STRUCTURES OF MARKETS AND ECONOMIC PARAMETERS. FOOD-ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION: FOOD-ANIMAL PRODUCTION IS A SIGNIFICANT AGRICULTURAL COMPONENT FOR THE STATE OF IOWA. ISU RESEARC HERS ARE ENGAGED WITH PROJECTS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE, PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, AND ECONOMIC RETURN OF THE INDUSTRY. A MAJOR REQUIREMENT FOR INCREASING PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IS GENETICALLY IMPROVED STRAINS OF ANIMALS WITH SUFFICIENT GENETIC DIVERSITY TO ALLOW CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN TRAITS INCLUDING YIELD, DISEASE AND PEST RESISTANCE, EFFICIENT REPRODUCTION, AND STRESS TOLERANCE, WHILE ASSURING NUTRITIONAL QUALITY AND ANIMAL WELFARE. THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS THAT ENABLE GENOMIC SELECTION FOR PRODUCTION, DISEASE RESISTANCE AND GENETIC DIVERSITY WILL GREATLY BENEFIT THESE AGRI-ANIMAL INDUSTRIES. INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING GENOMIC TOOLS, INTEGRATIVE BIOINFORMATICS TOOLS, DATABASES AND GENETIC RESOURCE POPULATIONS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENABLING GENOMIC DISCOVERIES IN LIVESTOCK, POULTRY AND AQUACULTURE SPECIES. POULTRY EGGS AND MEAT PROVIDE A MAJOR SOURCE OF NUTRIENT-DENSE ANIMAL PROTEIN FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. A GOAL OF RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY GENES, GENOMIC REGIONS AND HERITABLE BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTANT ECONOMIC TRAITS IN CHICKENS USING UNIQUE GENETIC POPULATIONS, AND TO DEVELOP AND TEST NEW METHODS FOR OPTIMALLY INTEGRATINGMOLECULAR DATA INTO PROGRAMS FOR POULTRY GENETIC IMPROVEMENT. SIMILARLY, BY APPLYING GENETIC, GENOMIC AND IMMUNOLOGICAL APPROACHES, THE IMPACT OF ALLELIC VARIATION IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC PATHOGENS OR OTHER IMMUNE STIMULI IS BEING INVESTIGATED. GENETIC VARIANTS IN DIVERSE CHICKEN POPULATIONS THAT DIFFER IN IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VIRAL INFECTION ARE BEING IDENTIFIED AND ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN GENETIC VARIANTS AND IMMUNE-RELATED PARAMETERS SUCH AS VIRAL LOAD, ANTIBODY RESPONSE STUDIED. WORK IS BEING UNDERTAKEN TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF MEAT PRODUCTION IN THE US AND ACROSS THE GLOBE. IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF LEAN MUSCLE ACCRETION IN FOOD-ANIMALS, A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIC BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING SKELETAL MUSCLE ACCRETION IS NECESSARY. MOREOVER, TECHNOLOGY IS BEING DEVELOPED SO DATA-DRIVEN DECISION-MAKING ABILITY CAN BE USED TO OPTIMIZE FURTHER ANIMAL GROWTH EFFICIENCY. TO ENHANCE NUTRIENT UTILIZATION FOR ANIMAL PRODUCTION, WORK IS BEING DONE TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE PRODUCTION WITH THE SAME OR LESS INPUTS BY DEVELOPING STRATEGIES THAT MAKE ANIMALS MORE EFFICIENT. WHEN ANIMALS BECOME MORE EFFICIENT, THERE ARE ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS BECAUSE THESE ANIMALS WOULD EXCRETE LESS NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS, THEREFORE MAINTAINING LAND STEWARDSHIP AND NUTRIENT BALANCE IN OUR SOILS. A PROJECT IS BEING DONE TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT RESULT IN BETTER CONVERSION OF FEED TO MILK BE CAUSE FEEDING DAIRY COWS ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN 50% THE COST OF PRODUCTION. IN OTHER WORK, IMPROVED METHODOLOGIES FOR THE FREEZING (CRYOPRESERVATION) OF LIVESTOCK PREIMPLANTATION EMBRYOS IS BEING INVESTIGATED SO THAT VALUABLE GENETIC MATERIAL CAN BE OBTAINED AT ONE LOCALE AND SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSPORTED EASILY AND ECONOMICALLY TO OTHER LOCATIONS WITH MINIMAL OR NO RISK OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION. IN THIS PROJECT, A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SPERM PHYSIOLOGY OF ALPACAS AND LLAMAS TO FACILITATE FIELD-PRACTICAL METHODS OF ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION, AS WELL AS LABORATORY-BASED PRODUCTION OF EMBRYOS FROM FEMALES OF HIGH GENETIC MERIT FOR MEAT, MILK, AND FIBER PRODUCTION IS BEING DEVELOPED. CROP MANAGEMENT AND DISEASE MITIGATION: AS IOWA IS A MAJOR PRODUCER OF GRAIN, SEVERAL TEAMS ARE ENGAGED IN PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES RELATED TO CROP MANAGEMENT AND DISEASE MITIGATION. WORK IS BEING DONE TO DEVELOP A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DEVELOPMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MECHANISMS AFFECT SEED QUALITY. US AGRICULTURE IS THE MOST COMPETITIVE AND PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD AND IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE QUALITY OF SEEDS UTILIZED. RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED TO FILL KNOWLEDGE GAPS TO ALLOW BETTER ACCESS TO QUALITY SEEDS BY THE FARMERS, AND PROVIDE THE TOOLS TO ASSESS AND MANIPULATE TRAITS TO ENHANCE SEED QUALITY AND THE CRITERIA WITH WHICH TO MEASURE IT. IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE U.S. AND IOWA GRAIN INDUSTRY AND TO CAPTURE ADDITIONAL VALUE IN THE CEREAL GRAINS, OILSEEDS, AND CO-PRODUCTS SUPPLY CHAINS ISANOTHER RESEARCH FOCUS. THIS WILL INVOLVE MEASURING, MODELING, AND ASSESSING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE QUALITY AND SAFETY ATTRIBUTES IN THE POST-HARVEST USAGE, DRYING, HANDLING, AND DISTRIBUTION OF CEREAL GRAINS AND OILSEEDS. RECENT STUDIES HAVE PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT RESISTANCE TO CRY34/35AB1 HAS EMERGED IN FIELD POPULATIONS OF WESTERN CORN ROOTWORM IN IOWA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE US CORN BELT, WITH SOME ROOTWORM POPULATIONS SHOWING RESISTANCE TO ALL AVAILABLE BACILLUS THURIGIENESIS (BT) TOXINS. THUS BT RESISTANCE BY WESTERN CORN ROOTWORM HAS PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR FARMERS BY REDUCING YIELD. RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED TO CHARACTERIZE RESISTANCE TO BT CORN BY POPULATIONS OF WESTERN CORN ROOTWORM AND HOW TO BEST MANAGE THESE BT-RESISTANT POPULATIONS. A GOAL OF THIS WORK WILL BE INCREASED ADOPTION OF INSECT RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT AND INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT APPROACHES IN CORN CROPPING SYSTEMS. APPLICATION OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT AND INSECT RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT IS EXPECTED TOINCREASE PROFITS FOR FARMERS, DECREASE USE OF INSECTICIDES AND PROLONG THE EFFICACY OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS, INCLUDING BT CORN AND CONVENTIONAL INSECTICIDES. SOYBEAN PESTS ARE ALSO ON THE RISE ACROSS THE US. THIS WORK FOCUSES ON MITIGATION OF BOTH EXISTING PESTS AND IDENTIFICATION OF FUTURE PESTS. THE RANGE OF EXPANSION OF INVASIVE PESTS, COUPLED WITH THE ADAPTATION OF NATIVE PESTS, NECESSITATE FURTHER RESEARCH INTO HOW INSECTS COPE WITH NEW SELECTION PRESSURES. A GOAL WILL BE TO DEVELOP COORDINATED BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPS) TO STAY AHEAD OF CHANGES IN PEST ASSEMBLAGES WITH EFFECTIVE PEST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. MAINTAINING HEALTHY SOILS IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF US AGRICULTURE PRODUCTIVITY. RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE NEW WAYS OF CHARACTERIZING SOIL BULK DENSITY AND SOIL STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY THEIR IMPACTS ON SOIL WATER MOVEMENT. A NEWLY DESIGNED SENSOR WILL BE USED TO MEASURE HOW EASILY HEAT AND ELECTRICITY MOVE THROUGH SOIL TO INDICATE CHANGES IN SOIL BULK DENSITY AND SOIL STRUCTURE. THESE MEASURES WILL BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE RATE OF WATER MOVEMENT IN SOIL TO PROVIDE A MEANS TO OBTAIN USEFUL ESTIMATES OF SOIL WATER INFILTRATION, SOIL WATER EVAPORATION, AND SOIL WATER DRAINAGE. IN OTHER PROJECTS, INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MACHINERY AND CROPS ARE BEING STUDIED TO PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR CREATING OPTIMAL MECHANICAL AND/OR AUTOMATED SOLUTIONS FOR SPECIALTY CROP PRODUCTION. THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF SENSORS AND SENSING SYSTEMS WHICH CAN PHENOTYPE, MEASURE AND INTERPRET QUALITY PARAMETERS, AUTOMATION SYSTEMS WHICH INCORPORATE VARYING DEGREES OF MECHANIZATION AND SENSORS TO ASSIST SPECIALTY CROP INDUSTRIES WITH LABOR, MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, AND REDUCTION OF PRODUCTION COSTS CAN BE CREATED. THE OUTCOME WILL BE TO FOSTER SPECIALTY CROP ARCHITECTURES AND SYSTEMS THAT ARE MORE AMENABLE TO MECHANIZED PRODUCTION. THE WORK IS IN COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER TO RAPIDLY COMMERCIALIZE AND DISSEMINATE THE RESEARCH. ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATION OF AGRONOMIC PRACTICES WITH RESTORATION AND PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES IS A RESEARCH FOCUS FOR ISU SCIENTISTS. ONE PROJECT HAS ESTABLISHED A RESEARCH NETWORK IN WHICH INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE ARE FREELY SHARED WITH ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE AMONG WILDLIFE. EFFORTS WILL BE TAKEN TO MONITOR MOSQUITO AND TICK POPULATIONS IN THE STATE OF IOWA, AS WELL AS VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE INCIDENCE IN THE STATE WITH SPECIAL IMPORTANCE FOCUSED ON THE TRANSMISSION OF WEST NILE (MOSQUITO) AND LYME DISEASE (TICK). THE INFORMATION GENERATED WILL BE USED TO BETTER PREVENT VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE THROUGH INTERACTIONS WITH PARTNERS AT LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ADDITIONAL EFFORTS WILL BE TAKEN TO UNDERSTAND THE ESTABLISHMENT AND SPREAD OF INVASIVE MOSQUITO SPECIES, AND TO BETTER DEFINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF TICK SPECIESIN THE STATE. IN OTHER WORK, AN INTEGRATED RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF MANAGED AND WILD BEES IN AGROECOSYSTEMS BY COUPLING BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN CROP PRODUCTION WITH CONSERVATION IS UNDERWAY WITH A GOAL TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY FROM FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH TO IMPROVE THE ABUNDANCE AND HEALTH OF MANAGED AND WILD BEES. A GOAL IS TO IMPROVE BEE HEALTH BY ADDRESSING THESE INTERACTING STRESSORS WITH EFFECTIVE, TESTED, AND REALISTIC AGRONOMIC AND CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ADOPTING IPM (INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT) PRACTICES IN ANNUAL CROPS. UTILIZING FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WASTE STREAMS EFFICIENTLY IS A FOCUS OF ANOTHER PROJECT. WORK IS BEING DONE TO CREATE INGREDIENTS AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF FOOD PRODUCTS BY UTILIZING INNOVATIVE METHODS TO CHARACTERIZE FOOD MATERIALS AND PACKAGING. WORK FOCUSED ON NEW AND IMPROVED PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS ULTRASOUND ASSISTED EXTRACTION AND MODIFICATION OF PROTEIN, CLEANING AND SANITATION OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PRIOR AND DURING PROCESSING, FATS AND LIPID BASED TECHNOLOGIES LIKE OLEOGELS, PACKAGING, NANOSENSORS IS UNDERWAY TO CREATE NEW USES FOR WASTE BYPRODUCTS. RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES TO CHARACTERIZE QUALITY AND SAFETY CHANGES, DEVELOPING PEDAGOGICAL ACTIVE LEARNING METHODOLOGIES FOR IMPROVED LEARNING OF FOOD ENGINEERING PROCESSING PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION WORKFORCE, AND DEVELOPING OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES FOR ENHANCING FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY TO STAKEHOLDERS. HUMAN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING: RESEARCHERS AT ISU ARE ENGAGED IN SEVERAL PROJECTS THAT FOCUS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THESE DIVERSE PROJECTS INCLUDE DIET AND NUTRITION, FOOD ACCESS, EARLY-CHILDHOOD LEARNING AND APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN SPECIALIZED CLOTHING. INCREASED INTEREST IN PLANT-BASED PROTEINS, INCLUDING PULSES, HAS ARISEN OVER THE PAST DECADE. RESEARCH IS BEING UNDERTAKEN TO UNDERSTAND CONSUMER ATTITUDES TOWARD BEAN CONSUMPTION AS DEMAND FOR BEAN-DERIVED FOODS WILL IMPROVE SUSTAINABILITY OF CROPPING SYSTEMS. THE WORK WILL UTILIZE SURVEYS TO ASSESS ADULT CONSUMER KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND PRACTICES REGARDING BEANS, BARRIERS AND MOTIVATORS TO THEIR USE, INTEREST IN PLANT-BASED PROTEIN, AND THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ON FOOD PURCHASES. INTEREST IN HOW FOOD IS PRODUCED AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF FOODS IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO CONSUMERS. A SPECIAL ISSUE OF FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION PROVIDES ARTICLES ON SUSTAINABILITY AND FOOD SYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY THE FOOD-ENERGY-WATER NEXUS, WHICH IS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE BROAD PICTURE OF SUSTAINABILITY. IT IS AN OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL WITH GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION, AND THIS SPECIAL CURATED ISSUE HAS BEEN WIDELY VIEWED. THE PROPORTION OF OLDER ADULTS IN THE US HAS INCREASED AND WORK IS BEING DONE TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING AGING ADULTS AND TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE INTERVENTIONS THAT IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN AGING ADULTS IN URBAN AND RURAL ENVIRONMENTS. THIS WILL GENERATE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING AGING ADULTS WITH THE GOAL OF PRESERVING AND IMPROVING HEALTH IN AGING ADULTS. UNDERSTANDING RESILIENCE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE COMBINATION OF POPULATION DECLINE, SHRINKING ECONOMIES, AND INCREASING MORTALITY RATES OF WORKING ADULTS LEADING TO WEAKENING OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FABRIC OF RURAL COMMUNITIES. THESE STRESSORS LEAVE RESIDENTS VULNERABLE TO OTHER ADVERSITIES, SUCH AS NATURAL AND MANMADE DISASTERS. WORK IN UNDERWAY TO DETERMINE BOTH THE UNIQUE NEEDS AND RESOURCES WITHIN RURAL AREAS, AS WELL AS THE BEST MECHANISMS FOR SUPPORTING RURAL FAMILIES IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESILIENCE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS SERVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. YET, THEIR CURRENT UNIFORMS DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THEM FROM DANGERS ENCOUNTERED WHILE FIGHTING FIRES. UNIFORMS OFTEN HINDER THEIR WORK DUE TO NOT FITTING CORRECTLY, NOT BEING DESIGNED TO HOLD NECESSARY GEAR, NOT BEING MADE OF APPROPRIATE  MATERIALS, AND NOT INCORPORATING WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY TO ASSIST IN HEALTH AND LOCATION MONITORING OF WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS. ISSUES OF FIT AND MOBILITY ARE PARTICULARLY PREVALENT FOR FEMALE WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS AS MOST AVAILABLE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING IS MADE FOR MEN. RESEARCHERS AT ISU ARE DEVELOPING NEW UNIFORMS THAT WILL BE TESTED BY USERS TO IMPROVE WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS' HEALTH AND SAFETY. THROUGH BETTER SUPPORTING WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS THROUGH IMPROVED PROTECTIVE CLOTHING, THESE INDIVIDUALS MAY BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITIES THEY PROTECT. INFLUENCES AND STRUCTURES OF MARKETS AND ECONOMIC PARAMETERS: ECONOMIC PRESSURES ARE CONTINUALLY PRESENT IN AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION AND OFTEN DRIVE POLICIES. ISU RESEARCHERS ARE ENGAGED IN CREATING ECONOMIC TOOLS AND STRATEGIES THAT WILL BETTER INFORM PRODUCERS WHO MUST MAKE DIFFICULT TRADEOFFS, AS WELL AS POLICY MAKERS THAT IMPLEMENT AGRONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS. IN ONE PROJECT, THE GROWTH OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS IS BEING ADVANCED THROUGH FOSTERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NETWORK OF INTER- AND TRANSDISCIPLINARY SCIENTISTS WHO EMBRACE A DIVERSITY OF RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES, AND THEREBY ARE BETTER ABLE TO FORECAST POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS AND AGRICULTURAL OUTCOMES. THE GOAL IS TO BUILD AND STRENGTHEN COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION EFFORTS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF ANIMAL PRODUCTION, AROUND MITIGATION OF LIVESTOCK ODOR, BIOSECURITY, AND ANIMAL WASTE MANAGEMENT. OTHER PROJECTS ARE AIMED AT OBTAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF KEY ASPECTS REGARDING THE FUNCTIONING OF AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, SO AS TO BE ABLE TO UNCOVER THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG FARM INCOME, LAND VALUES, AND CASH RENTS, AND THE UNDERLYING FORCES DRIVING THEM; PREDICTING THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF DECLINING INCOMES ON FARM BUSINESSES, THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY, AND THE STATE ECONOMY; AND CREATING A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FACED BY AGRICULTURAL LENDERS ASSOCIATED WITH WEAKER FARM FINANCIAL POSITIONS, AND HOW LENDERS ADAPT AND RESPOND TO THEM. A GOAL OF ANOTHER PROJECT WILL BE GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS OF FINANCIAL AND HEALTH DECISIONS MADE BY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES, BY PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING, IMPLEMENTING, AND EVALUATING EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES TO INCREASE HEALTH LITERACY, HEALTH INSURANCE LITERACY AND TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL DECISION MAKING IN THE FACE OF PHYSICAL, FINANCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGE. THE RESEARCH WILL HELP INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES NAVIGATE FINANCIAL AND HEALTH DECISIONS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUTREACH MATERIALS THAT HELP THEM UNDERSTAND HOW, WHEN AND WHAT TYPES OF QUESTIONS TO ASK, AND TO WHOM, IN AN ATTEMPT TO HELP AVOID COSTLY FINANCIAL ERRORS AND IMPROVE FINANCIAL AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. TO MEET GROWING CONSUMER NEEDS AND TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL MARKETS, THE US FOOD INDUSTRY REQUIRES CREATION AND READY ACCESS TO THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, WELL-TRAINED PERSONNEL, AND A CONTINUOUS DIALOG BETWEEN ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS AND INDUSTRY PRACTITIONERS. COLLABORATIONS AMONG ENGINEERS, FOOD SCIENTISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY SETTING, AND ACROSS THE NATION ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO EFFECTIVELY A DDRESS THESE NEEDS OF THE INDUSTRY BY ADVANCING TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH RESEARCH AND PREPARING FUTURE WORK FORCE THROUGH MENTORING AND EDUCATING STUDENTS AND SCIENTISTS, AND BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN RESEARCH AND IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH OUTREACH. THE IMPACT OF OIL SHALE MINING IN THE US HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY. RESEARCH IS BEING DONE TO CONSTRUCT A MODEL TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPACT OF THE WEALTH OF THE NEWLY DISCOVERED US OIL SHALE RESERVES ON MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, AND FOOD INDUSTRIES. IDENTITIES CALCULATED FROM SUPPLY AND DEMAND SCHEDULES WILL DETERMINE THE WELFARE GAIN FROM AGRICULTURAL AND MANUFACTURED TRADE, AND ASSESSMENTS OF THE WELFARE CHANGE ASSOCIATED WITH TRADE POLICY CHANGES. THIS WORK WILL LEAD TO MORE INFORMED ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AROUND THIS IMPORTANT INDUSTRY. THE INFORMATION AND OUTCOMES OF THE HATCH-MULTISTATE PROJECTS BEING CONDUCTED BY ISU SCIENTISTS ARE DISSEMINATED BROADLY TO A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING FARMERS AND PRODUCERS, THE AGRI-BIO INDUSTRY, RESEARCH COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD, LOCAL, STATE AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, STUDENTS, AND CONSUMERS. THE IMPACTS OF THE WORK ARE MONITORED AND ASSESSED TO ENSURE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE FUNDS THROUGH PEER REVIEW, PUBLICATIONS (BOTH PROFESSIONAL AND LAY) AND REPORTS.

A FIFTH REGIONAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CENTER IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE REMAINS COMMITTED TO THIS STA TEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH A PRESENCE IN ALL 75 ARKANSAS COUNTIES, ENSURING THAT RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION EDUCATORS ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE SCIENCE AND BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE AND THE BROADER NEEDS OF FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. CONSISTENT WITH THE LAND GRANT MISSION, DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION FACULTY HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING LEADERSHIP IN THE DEVELOPMENT, DISSEMINATION AND DELIVERY OF INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. DIVISION RESEARCHERS CONDUCT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH FOR ARKANSAS PRODUCERS, BUSINESSES, COMMUNITIES, AND FAMILIES. COUNTY AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS STRIVE TO PROVIDE THE BEST SCIENCE?BASED RECOMMENDATIONS AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH STAKEHOLDERS ARE EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE SOURCES AND COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION AND DATA, THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE REMAINS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF IMPARTIAL AND SCIENCE?BASED RECOMMENDATIONS, INDEPENDENT OF FINANCIAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL INTERESTS. ALTHOUGH MOST IN?PERSON EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES HAVE RESUMED, THE DIVISION WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER TIMELY AND RESPONSIVE DISTANCE ED UCATION WEBINARS AND RESOURCES IN 2023 TO ENSURE WIDE?SPREAD ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BY ARKANSANS. THIS INCLUDES MONTHLY WEBINARS THROUGH THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL LAW CENTER ON CURRENT AND EMERGING IMPORTANT AGRICULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOOD LAW TOPICS. ONLINE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE 24/7/365 THROUGH THE DIVISION'S WEBSITE (HTTP://COURSES.UADA.EDU). DIVISION FACULTY ALSO ADDRESS TIMELY TOPICS OF INTEREST TO ARKANSANS THROUGH VIRTUAL EVENTS AND OTHER WEB?BASED PROGRAMMING. THE FOCUS OF WORK CONDUCTED BY THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO BE GUIDED ANNUALLY BY GRASS?ROOTS, COMMUNITY?BASED INPUT FROM A DIVERSE RANGE OF ARKANSAS CITIZENS; MAINLY THROUGH THE USE OF COUNTY EXTENSION COUNCILS AND OTHER LOCAL AND PROGRAM ADVISORY GROUPS. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE FORMALLY ENGAGED A LARGE POOL OF STAKEHOLDERS (INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL CLIENTELE, PRODUCERS, SCHOOLS, PARTNER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY LEADERS, UNDERSERVED GROUPS, AND LEGISLATORS) IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE 2017?2023 STRATEGIC PLAN. BASED ON BROAD STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK, THE DIVISION IDENTIFIED FIVE AREAS TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS: AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING, ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD, STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES, BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES, AND NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT. THESE FIVE EMPHASIS AREAS HELP TO PROVIDE STRATEGIC LOCAL GUIDANCE FOR DIVISION RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AND HELP TO SUPPORT INTEGRATED RESEARCH/EXTENSION EFFORTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE NIFA SCIENCE EMPHASIS AREAS. AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING A CRITICAL NEED IN ARKANSAS, AND NATIONWIDE, IS TO ENSURE FARM AND FOREST ENTERPRISES ARE PROFITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE TO MEET THE DEMANDS FOR SAFE FOOD, FIBER, AND FUEL. THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY MUST CONTEND WITH MORE REGULATIONS, HIGHER INPUT COSTS, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, CLIMATE EXTREMES, AND GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IN A HUMANE AND SUSTAINABLE MANNER WHILE DECREASING COSTS THROUGH EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. PLANT SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE ECONOMICS, ENVIRONMENT, GENETICS AND BREEDING, WEEDS, DISEASE, PEST MANAGEMENT, SAFE HANDLING AND STORAGE, FOOD PROCESSING, CULTURAL PRACTICES, AND SOIL FERTILITY. ANIMAL SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE GENETICS, REPRODUCTION, ECONOMICS, NUTRITION, WASTE MANAGEMENT, PHYSIOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS, HEALTH, AND ANIMAL WELLBEING. COMMON TO BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL SYSTEMS IS THE APPROPRIATE USE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY. ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOODS THE AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD IS VITAL TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN ALL COMMUNITIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE WORKS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETS THROUGH RESEARCH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS THAT TARGET OBESITY AND ENCOURAGE BETTER CONSUMER HABITS THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE EXPANDED FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM (EFNEP) AND SNAP?ED. EFNEP EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, WITH LIMITED INCOME, TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ATTITUDE, AND BEHAVIOR CHANGES NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN NUTRITIONALLY SOUND DIETS AND ENHANCE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. SNAP?ED PROVIDES NUTRITION EDUCATION TO FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE NUTRITION ASSISTANCE TO HELP CONSUMERS MAKE BETTER CHOICES ABOUT WHAT TO EAT TO STAY ACTIVE AND LIVE BETTER. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN FOOD SYSTEMS THROUGH RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. THE LONG?TERM GROWTH OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY IN ARKANSAS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE INDUSTRY'S ABILITY TO INNOVATE, TO RESPOND TO CONSUMERS' TASTE AND EXPECTATIONS, TO EMPLOY A QUALITY WORKFORCE AND TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE MAINTAINING ECONOMIC VIABILITY. PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS AND AGENCIES ARE PURSUED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS FOODS. EXTENSION PROGRAMS HELP PEOPLE FROM MANY BACKGROUNDS UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE WISE NUTRITIONAL CHOICES AND STRETCH FOOD DOLLARS BY COOKING FOR THEMSELVES AND UTILIZE A WIDER VARIETY OF FOODS. THE DIVISION ALSO STRIVES TO ENHANCE FOOD SAFETY THROUGH RESEARCH AND TEACHING BEST PRACTICES TO ALL WHO HANDLE FOOD, FROM FIELD TO TABLE. THIS INCLUDES EDUCATION RELATED TO FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, SUCH AS HOW TO ADHERE TO THE FDA'S PRODUCE SAFETY RULE AND MEETING CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THROUGH SERVSAFE, A FOOD SAFETY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN FOOD HANDLING OR FOOD SERVICE AND RELATED INDUSTRIES. EXTENSION EDUCATORS PROVIDE EVIDENCE?BASED INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT ARKANSANS ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE BEST FOOD SAFETY INFORMATION TO KEEP THEIR FAMILIES SAFE FROM FOODBORNE ILLNESSES AND OTHER FOOD?RELATED SAFETY ISSUES. STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES IT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES THAT AFFECT FAMILIES, CONSUMERS, AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE. THE MENTAL, PHYSICAL, AND FINANCIAL WELL?BEING OF FAMILIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING PROSPERITY FOR ARKANSANS. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE IS RESPONDING TO THESE NEEDS BY DELIVERING RESEARCH?BASED PROGRAMS TO REDUCE STRESS, IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH, STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS, INCREASE FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND IMPROVE WELL?BEING FOR ARKANSANS. 4?H CLUBS, ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS ACROSS ARKANSAS INVOLVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN HANDS?ON EDUCATION AND SERVICE?LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT ENHANCED THEIR LIFE SKILLS, INCLUDING DECISION MAKING, PROBLEM SOLVING, CRITICAL THINKING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES. 4?H CONVEYS TO THE PUBLIC THAT ALL YOUTH HAVE VALUE. STRIVING TO REACH A DIVERSE POPULATION IS KEY TO DEVELOPING CURRICULUM, OFFERING RECOGNITION, AND TEACHING STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS TO REPRESENT OUR STATE'S CURRENT DEMOGRAPHICS. BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY, TECHNOLOGY AND POPULATION ARE TRANSFORMING HOW ARKANSANS LIVE AND WORK. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND EFFECTIVELY EMPLOY TOOLS AND RESOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LABOR FORCE REQUIRES ENHANCED SKILLS AND TRAINING TO SUCCEED IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY. AT A TIME WHEN MANY RURAL AREAS ARE LOSING POPULATION, COMMUNITIES MUST TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO CREATE A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE. EFFECTIVE AND INCLUSIVE LEADERS WORKING WITH ENGAGED CITIZENS ARE KEY TO THIS EFFORT. TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL NEEDS, PROGRAMS FOCUS ON FOUR AREAS: ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EVOLVING ECONOMIES; LEADERSHIP AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT; AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE. NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ARKANSAS FACES CRITICAL NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUES INCLUDING GROUNDWATER DECLINE IN EASTERN ARKANSAS FROM IRRIGATION, WATER QUALITY CONCERNS FROM ANIMAL MANURES, SEDIMENT LOSS FROM CROPLAND AND URBAN STORMWATER. WE ALL SHARE CONCERNS FOR SOIL HEALTH, AIR QUALITY, PROTECTION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OF FORESTS AND WILDLIFE HABITAT, BUT AGRICULTURE IS UNDER SCRUTINY TO REDUCE IMPACT ON NATURAL RESOURCES. WE FOCUS ON UNBIASED RESEARCH AND SCIENCE?BASED EXTENSION EFFORTS TO BALANCE CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. PROGRAMS, SUCH AS ARKANSAS DISCOVERY FARMS AND THE CENTER FOR AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SUSTAINABILITY, WILL COLLABORATE WITH FARMERS, LANDOWNERS, AND INDUSTRY TO DELIVER INNOVATIVE, SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE PROPER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO INFORM RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS, THE DIVISION WILL LAUNCH A FORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT IN 2023 TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIES FOR THE ORGANIZATION'S NEW STRATEGIC PLAN WITH INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "07ee21ac-739d-5576-dcac-ca74ea0e4047-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23HMFPXXXXG029_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736111, "Award ID": "NI23HMFPXXXXG028", "Award Amount": 1289127.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.203", "Description": "THE PURPOSE OF THIS AWARD IS TO SUPPORT MULTISTATE RESEARCH PROJECTS CONDUCTED BY FACULTY ACROSS THE COLLEGE THAT HELP ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE FY2023 KENTUCKY PLAN OF WORK: AGRICULTURAL, ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES, ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL WELL-BEING, FOOD SAFETY AND SECURITY, AND NUTRITION AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLES.

THE PROJECTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED WITH THESE FUNDS ARE MULTISTATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECTS ADMINISTERED BY THE REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS OF STATE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS: THE WESTERN ASSOCIATION OF AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS DIRECTORS (WAAESD), THE NORTHEASTERN REGIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION DIRECTORS (NERA), THE NORTH CENTRAL REGIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION DIRECTORS (NCRA), THE SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION OF AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION DIRECTORS (SAAESD), AND THE ASSOCIATION OF 1890 RESEARCH DIRECTORS (ARD). MANY OF THESE PROJECTS ARE INTEGRATED PROJECTS INVOLVING BOTH RESEARCH AND EXTENSION OR EDUCATION. OUR SCIENTISTS ARE INVOLVED IN MULTISTATE PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS ALL SEVEN CRITICAL ISSUES DEFINED IN THE UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY FY2023 PLAN OF WORK: (1) GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND HUNGER; (2) CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES; (3) NUTRITION AND HEALTH; (4) FOOD SAFETY; (5) HEALTHY, FINANCIALLY SECURE FAMILIES; (6) YOUTH DEVELOPMENT; AND (7) COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. THESE SEVEN CRITICAL ISSUES ALIGN WELL WITH NIFA'S FIRST FIVE STRATEGIC GOALS: (1) COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE TO SUPPORT AMERICA'S WORKING LANDS, NATURAL RESOURCES AND COMMUNITIES; (2) ENSURE AMERICA'S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM IS EQUITABLE, RESILIENT, AND PROSPEROUS; (3) FOSTER AN EQUITABLE AND COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE FOR ALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS; (4) PROVIDE ALL AMERICANS SAFE, NUTRITIOUS FOOD; AND (5) EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN RURAL AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. THE MULTISTATE PROJECTS SUPPORTED BY THESE FUNDS RESULT IN DELIVERABLES THAT INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS AT SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS, SCIENTIFIC AND LAY PUBLICATIONS, OUTREACH ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EXTENSION EVENTS AND FACT SHEETS, AND TOOLS OR DEVICES DESIGNED TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC NEEDS. IMPACTS FROM THIS RESEARCH INCLUDE CHANGES IN KNOWLEDGE, CHANGES IN ACTIONS, AND CHANGES IN CONDITIONS. THIS RESEARCH BENEFITS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS AND THE BROADER AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY; FOOD PROCESSORS; THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF UTAH, THE WESTERN UNITED STATES, THE COUNTRY, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY; STATE AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES; AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SEVEN CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WE ARE WORKING TO ADDRESS ARE PROVIDED BELOW: GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND HUNGER THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS GOAL IS TO ENHANCE GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY THROUGH PRODUCTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS. THIS IS NOT MEANT AS AN ABANDONMENT OF PAST AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES OR AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS. IT REQUIRES AN EXPANDED VIEW OF AGRICULTURE, NOT AN ABANDONMENT OF AGRICULTURE. WE CAN MAKE REAL PROGRESS IN IMPROVING THE STANDARD OF LIVING, NOT ONLY IN THE U.S., BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TO FEED GROWING POPULATIONS, WE MUST DEVELOP MORE STRESS-RESISTANT CROPS AND ENSURE AN IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY OF LIVESTOCK. SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES THAT RESULT IN HEAT, DROUGHT, AND SALINE-RESISTANT PLANTS WILL ALLOW FARMERS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN WORLD MARKETS, WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO FARM PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS WILL INCLUDE TRADITIONAL CROP AND LIVESTOCK BREEDING BUT WILL ALSO EMPHASIZE GENOMICS. CROPS WILL BE PRODUCED WHICH RELY LESS ON MAN-MADE INPUTS LIKE FERTILIZER AND FUELS, AND MORE ON GENE MANIPULATION. HOWEVER, IT WILL REQUIRE MORE THAN LABORATORY WORK AS THESE IMPROVED PLANTS MUST BE FIELD -TESTED, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. MORE FOCUS WILL NEED TO BE GIVEN TO THE \"SCIENCE\" OF AGRICULTURE. ANIMALS MUST BE MADE MORE EFFICIENT IN THE USE OF EXISTING OR EVEN ALTERED FORAGE RESOURCES. CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES RANGELAND, FORESTS, AND AGRICULTURE ARE ALL CLIMATE DEPENDENT. CONSEQUENTLY, ANYCHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE WILL REQUIRE THAT PLANTS AND ANIMALS ADAPT TO OR MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. AGRICULTURE THE MANAGEMENT OF RANGELAND AND FORESTS MUST BE AT THE FOREFRONT IN ADAPTING TO NEW CLIMATE REALITIES, AS WELL AS MITIGATING MANY OF THE INFLUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE CONCEPT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT NEW TO UTAH PRODUCERS. UTAHAN'S HAVE ADJUSTED TO CHANGES IN WATER AND TEMPERATURE FOR MANY YEARS. YET, THERE IS MORE THAT CAN BE DONE TO ENHANCE THE PRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENT OF BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS. ANIMALS CAN BECOME MORE EFFICIENT IN THE CONSUMPTION OF FORAGES THROUGH APPROPRIATE BREEDING PRACTICES AND TAILORING LIVESTOCK TO MEET FORAGE CONDITIONS. WHILE THERE IS GREAT VIGOR IN MANY BREEDS, SOME ARE CLEARLY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE SPARSELY VEGETATIVE STATE OF MUCH OF UTAH'S LAND. EFFICIENCIES CAN BE IMPROVED THROUGH GENETIC MODIFICATIONS AS WELL. PLANTS CAN BE MADE MORE RESISTANT TO DROUGHT AND SALINITY THROUGH TRADITIONAL BREEDING PRACTICES, AND THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF GENOMICS. WATER WILL BECOME AN EVEN MORE CRITICAL PART OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PROCESSES AS IT BECOMES LESS AVAILABLE AND/OR THE QUALITY BECOMES LESS SUITABLE FOR AGRICULTURE. THE IDEA OF WATER DEPENDENCY UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE CANNOT BE OVER EMPHASIZED AS POPULATIONS INCREASE, AND WATER SHIFTS FROM AGRICULTURAL TO MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL USES. PUBLIC/PRIVATE LAND INTERFACE IS ANOTHER AREA REQUIRING EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND OUTREACH. SIXTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL LAND AVAILABLE IN THE WEST IS PUBLIC LAND, OWNED BY EITHER THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS PRESENTS UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO THE WEST THAT MOST OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CANNOT BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND. NUTRITION AND HEALTH IT SEEMS STRANGE TO SPEAK OF NUTRITION IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS SUCH A REMARKABLE FOOD SYSTEM, BUT NUTRITION IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY--BUT IT IS A PROBLEM OF BOTH SCARCITY AND PLENTY. THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, SUCH AS YOUNG CHILDREN AND AGING ADULTS, ARE SUBJECT TO FOOD SCARCITY. OUR COMMON GOAL SHOULD BE TO ALLOW OUR CHILDREN TO LIVE HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. HENCE, ADEQUATE NUTRITION BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR THOSE BOTH AFFLUENT AND THOSE IN POVERTY WITHIN THE U.S. AND OTHERS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THAT DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT TO AVOID DISEASE AND MALNUTRITION. BECAUSE THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN MOVING AGRICULTURE AND FOOD TECHNOLOGIES FORWARD, THEY SHOULD ALSO BE THE MEANS TO MAKE THE FOOD SELECTIONS MORE NUTRITIOUS. IN ADDITION TO CHANGING THE NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF FOOD, EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS TO TEACH PEOPLE THE CONSEQUENCES OF OBESITY MUST BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE. FOOD SAFETY FOOD SAFETY IS A NECESSARY AREA OF EMPHASIS AS FOOD AND FIBER PATHOGENS INCREASINGLY COST THE U.S. ECONOMY SIGNIFICANT LOST TIME AND INCREASED HEALTH EXPENDITURES. NEW DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO RAPIDLY TEST FOOD PRODUCTS FOR PATHOGENS. BUT EVEN MORE BASIC IS THE NEED TO PROVIDE A SAFE SYSTEM THROUGH WHICH FOOD CAN BE TRANSFERRED. SOME OF THAT WILL INVOLVE BETTER IDENTIFICATION OF FOOD AND FIBER FLOWS WITHIN THE U.S. AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TRACEABILITY WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BUT NEW, LESS COSTLY METHODS OF FOOD CHAIN IDENTIFICATION MUST BE DEVELOPED. PATHOGENS CAN ENTER THE FOOD SUPPLY AT ANY POINT DURING THE PRODUCTION, HARVEST, PROCESSING, AND TRANSPORTING PROCESS. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE U.S. CONSUMER NOT HAVE TO QUESTION IF THEIR FOOD IS SAFE. GREAT STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE IN PROTECTING THE FOOD SYSTEM, BUT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND OUTREACH ARE REQUIRED. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE SAFETY OF THEIR FOOD SUPPLY, WHICH SOMETIMES IS A DIFFICULT TASK GIVEN THE EXTENSIVE PROCESSING THAT OCCURS . IT MUST ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED THAT AMERICA HAS THE SAFEST FOOD SUPPLY THE WORLD. FOOD SAFETY IN THE HOME IS ALSO IMPORTANT AND IS INCLUDED IN THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. AREAS OF CONCERN INCLUDE PROPER PREPARATION, STORAGE, AND PRESERVATION OF FOOD, INCLUDING PROPER PRO CEDURES FOR CANNING FOODS. HEALTHY, FINANCIALLY SECURE FAMILIES UTAH IS IN THE TOP 5 OF THE U.S. STATES WITH BANKRUPTCY AND MUCH MORE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION NEED TO BE DONE TO FREE THE STATE'S CONSUMERS FROM THIS TRAP. BECAUSE OF UTAH'S TYPICALLY LARGER FAMILY SIZE, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME AVAILABLE FOR BASIC FAMILY NEEDS SLIPS BELOW THE MEAN FOR THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. UTAH FAMILIES ALREADY FACE HIGH DEBT LOADS LEADING TO BANKRUPTCY, LOW SAVINGS, AND THE LACK OF LIQUID ASSETS. HENCE, A PRIORITY OF THIS PLANNED PROGRAM IS TO ENHANCE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. OTHER ASPECTS OF FAMILY HEALTH THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE HEALTHY MARITAL AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT HEALTHY EATING HABITS. YOUTH DEVELOPMENT YOUTH ISSUES ARE PARAMOUNT IN A STATE WITH HIGHER-THAN-AVERAGE BIRTH RATES. AS THE NUMBER OF YOUTH GROWS, MORE RESEARCH ON EDUCATION IS NEEDED IN IDENTIFYING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE GROWTH AND MATURATION. A SIGNIFICANT PRIORITY OF THIS CRITICAL ISSUE IS TO DISCOVER IMPROVED METHODS FOR ENCOURAGING POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. COMMUNITY RESILIENCE THE EXISTING CONFLICTS BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LANDOWNERS AND URBAN-RURAL PRESSURES ARE LIKELY TO BE EXACERBATED OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS AS ALTERNATIVE USES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDS INCREASE AND URBAN ENCROACHMENT CONTINUES TO EXTEND INTO RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE AND REGION, RESULTING IN A DECLINE OF AVAILABLE OPEN-SPACE. THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF MANY RURAL AREAS IS ALSO IN JEOPARDY. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH BUSINESS RETENTION AND EXPANSION ACTIVITIES NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION, COMMUNITY RESILIENCE DEPENDS ON SOUND COMMUNITY PLANNING, AND INVESTMENT IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EDUCATION, CHILDCARE, YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, RECREATION, HEALTH CARE, AND FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d345a8ea-b0ac-7e5d-b949-6507917f2140-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23HMFPXXXXG008_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735994, "Award ID": "NI23HMFPXXXXG007", "Award Amount": 544876.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-17", "CFDA Number": "10.203", "Description": "RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE NH AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION.

WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE AREA, RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES, PROCESSES AND DELIVERS FOOD, FIBER, AND MYRIAD ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON BIOTECHNOLOGICAL AND MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN CROP AND DAIRY PRODUCTION TO MINIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKET RISKS AND CAPTURING NEW MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES. RESEARCH HERE IS EXPECTED TO GROW WITH THE RECENT HIRING OF A CROP BREEDER FACULTY. FOCUS WILL ALSO BE PLACED ON HELPING THE STATE AND REGION CONTINUETO EXPAND ITS SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY TO BENEFIT THE BLUE ECONOMY.  WORK WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO TARGET ISSUES RELATED TO MITIGATING AND ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE AS A SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THROUGH BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCE, AN EMERGING AREA OF EXCELLENCE IS IN SOIL MICROBIOLOGY, AND THESE EFFORTS WILL BE ONE OF THE CORE OF THE NHAES RESEARCH MISSION IN CLIMATE SCIENCE. A SECOND CORE AREA IS IN WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WATER AND AGRICULTURAL LAND AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.  FOOD SAFETY IS AN AREA IN WHICH LESS RESEARCH IS EXPECTED THAN IN THE PAST. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH THAT WILL CONTINUE WILL FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE GROWING AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO MANAGING PATHOGENS IN SHELLFISH. DIFFERENTIATING STRAINS OF PATHOGENS AND PREDICTING NEW STRAINS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT THE NORTHEAST AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY MAINTAINS ITS HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS. RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO GROW IN THE NUTRITION AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS AREAS, AS EARLY-CAREER FACULTY TRANSITION INTO BEING MORE EXPERIENCED SCIENTISTS AND NEW FACULTY ARE ONBOARDED. THE FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE ON IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENSURING NUTRITIONAL BALANCE AND HEALTH OF UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS IN NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND. THIS INCLUDES REFUGEE, IMMIGRANT, AND LATINX POPULATIONS, WHICH HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW IN SIZE IN THE REGION. CONSIDERATIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THESE POPULATIONS' EATING HABITS, MICROBIOME COMPOSITIONS, AND NUTRITIONAL BEHAVIORS WILL HELP INFORM SCIENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS.  LASTLY, AS NEW HAMPSHIRE'S COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE DEMOGRAPHICALLY AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY, NHAES RESEARCH WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS PART OF ITS RESEARCH PORTFOLIO ON CHARACTERIZING THOSE TRENDS, THE IMPACTS OF THOSE TRENDS, AND HOW LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS CAN BE BEST DEVELOPED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND SUPPORT THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE AND REGION. USING SCIENCE-BASED, DATA-DRIVEN METHODS TO IDENTIFY KEY FACTORS STRESSING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDING RESEARCH- INFORMED RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE INDIVIDUAL, FIRM, MUNICIPALITY, AND STATE LEVELS ARE CRUCIAL FOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY.

THE PLAN OF WORK REFLECTS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TO BENEFIT AGRIBUSINESS, COMMUNITIES, AND CITIZENS OF SC. THE RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED ON THE MAIN CAMPUS OF CLEMSON UNIVERSITY AND IN EACH OF THE SIX RESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS (RECS) LOCATED ACROSS THE STATE. FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE ADVANCING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SAFEGUARDING THE FOOD SUPPLY, PRESERVING NATURAL RESOURCES, AND PREPARING YOUNGER GENERATIONS TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS. RESEARCH TO IMPROVE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY OF AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS INCLUDES OUR ADVANCED PLANT TECHNOLOGY (APT) PROGRAM AND OUR PRECISION AGRICULTURE PROGRAM. THE APT PROGRAM USES TRADITIONAL PLANT BREEDING AND MOLECULAR GENETICS TO DEVELOP NEW CROPS AND CROP-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PRECISION AGRICULTURE PROGRAM DEVELOPS DEVICES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR SITE-SPECIFIC AND MORE EFFICIENT USE OF INPUTS (E.G., WATER, FERTILIZER, PESTICIDES). OTHER RESEARCH EFFORTS STUDY LIVESTOCK FORAGE PRODUCTION TO ENHANCE FARM PROFITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES SPECIFIC TO THE MAJOR AGRONOMIC AND SPECIALTY CROPS FOCUS ON REDUCTION OF COSTS TO MANAGE WEEDS, DISEASES AND INSECT PESTS. LIKEWISE, INVESTIGATORS ARE DEVELOPING IMPROVEMENTS TO IRRIGATION WATER MANAGEMENT USING REAL-TIME SOIL AND WEATHER INPUTS. RESEARCH PROGRAMS TO SUSTAIN CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES INCLUDE: 1) REMOTE CLIMATIC DATA COLLECTION AND DATA MANAGEMENT ON FORESTS, 2) TECHNIQUES TO ENHANCE FOREST GROWTH AND QUALITY (SILVICULTURE, HARVESTING OPERATIONS, FOREST MANAGEMENT, AND FOREST HEALTH), 3) HYDROLOGIC AND FOREST PRODUCTIVITY PROCESSES ALONG HYDROPERIODS AND SALINITY GRADIENTS.

THE STATE REPRESENTS A MAJOR REGION OF RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES. ITS 365 MILLION ACRES INCLUDE THE NATION'S LARGEST OIL RESERVES, COAL DEPOSITS AND THE TWO LARGEST NATIONAL FORESTS. THE STATE CONTAINS THE LARGEST TERRESTRIAL BIOME ON EARTH - THE BOREAL FOREST - THAT IT SHARES WITH OTHER NORTHERN LOCATIONS. ALASKA HAS A VARIED GEOGRAPHY THAT OFFERS SOILS FOR PRODUCTION OF FOOD, FIBER AND BIOMASS FUELS AS WELL AS FOR A MULTITUDE OF RECREATIONAL AND TOURISM ACTIVITIES.  ALASKA'S NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY, THOUGH RESOURCE INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY EXTRACTIVE IN NATURE. ALASKA'S ECONOMY HAS BECOME DEPENDENT UPON REVENUES RELATED TO PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT. TO DIVERSIFY ITS ECONOMY, THE STATE IS EXPANDING AND EXAMINING POTENTIAL IN MOVING TOWARD NON-PETROLEUM NATURAL RESOURCES FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COST-EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE. THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS A PREDOMINANT FORCE IN THE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF ANY TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS (UAF) IN GENERAL AND AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY EXPERIMENT STATION (AFES), IN PARTICULAR, MEET THE CHALLENGES OF INCREASING DEMANDS FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT ARE RELEVANT TO SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF ALASKA'S RESOURCES AND BRING COMMUNITY IDEAS TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE'S RESOURCES.  WHILE ALASKA IMPORTS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FOODS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, GROWERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PRODUCE FRESH MARKET POTATOES, VEGETABLES AND HERBS; FORAGES, GRAINS AND MANUFACTURED LIVESTOCK FEEDS; CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDE BEDDING PLANTS, FLORALS, LANDSCAPE ORNAMENTALS AND SHORT SEASON VEGETABLES; AND A VARIETY OF NICHE MARKET CROPS.  LIVESTOCK ENTERPRISES IN ALASKA ARE VARIED IN SIZE AND SPECIES OF ANIMAL IN PRODUCTION. PRODUCERS NEED INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO NORTHERN LATITUDES THAT WILL PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE AN ABUNDANT AND SAFE FOOD SUPPLY. AS THE POPULATION GROWS, MORE LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY PRODUCED FOOD WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE GREATER FOOD SECURITY. MANY ALASKANS LIVE A SUBSISTENCE LIFESTYLE OR SUPPLEMENT THEIR DIETS WITH FISH AND GAME MEAT.  HIGH ENERGY COSTS REMAIN A CRITICAL ISSUE, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL ALASKA, WHERE FUEL OIL CAN COST DOUBLE AND GASOLINE CAN COST TRIPLE THE AVERAGE PRICE PER GALLON COMPARED TO URBAN AREAS.  RESEARCH WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON NEW AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY, WOOD AND BIOMASS AND ENERGY CONSERVATION. AFES WILL WORK TO PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION TO MANAGE RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY FOR ENHANCING THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE AT HIGH LATITUDES. RESEARCH WILL ALSO FOCUS ON THE HEALTH OF OUR LARGEST FOREST BIOME, INCLUDING UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE, INSECT INFESTATION, AND LAND USE. ECOLOGICAL DROUGHT IS IMPACTING FOREST FIRE THREAT AND BARK BEETLE INFESTATION, WHICH IS DAMAGING FOREST NATURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR TOURISM, FIREWOOD AVAILABILITY, AND INCREASED FIRE RISK. WHILE FORESTERS, FARMERS AND LAND MANAGERS USE RESEARCH RESULTS, ALL ALASKANS BENEFIT FROM THE WISE USE OF LAND RESOURCES.  RESEARCH PROJECTS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM PRODUCERS, INDUSTRIES, AND STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR INFORMATION ON PLANT, ANIMAL AND SOIL SCIENCES, FOREST SCIENCES AND RESOURCES MANAGEMENT. AFES PRIORITIES, LIKE NATIONAL PRIORITIES, ARE TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABILITY OF FOOD, FOREST, AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS; ADAPT TO AND MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE; SUPPORT ENERGY SECURITY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES; ENSURE A SAFE, SECURE AND ABUNDANT FOOD SUPPLY; STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; AND SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND RESILIENCE. EXPERIMENT STATION RESEARCHERS WILL CONTINUE TO PUBLISH RESEARCH IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, BOOKS, AND IN EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETINS, CIRCULARS, NEWSLETTERS, RESEARCH PROGRESS REPORTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PUBLICATIONS. SCIENTISTS WILL ALSO DISSEMINATE THEIR FINDINGS THROUGH CONFERENCES, PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS, WORKSHOPS AND OTHER PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS LIKE WEBSITES AND BLOGS.  AGRICULTURE <(>&<)> FOOD SECURITY: ALASKA IMPORTS OVER 90 PERCENT OF FOODS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CONSUMED IN THE STATE. GROWERS' PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY FOR IN-STATE CONSUMPTION AND USE, INCLUDING FRESH MARKET POTATOES, FORAGES, GRAINS AND OTHER LIVESTOCK FEEDS, GREENHOUSE FLOWERS AND VEGETABLES AND A VARIETY OF \"NICHE MARKET\" CROPS AND PRODUCTS. COMMERCIAL HORTICULTURE INCLUDES ORNAMENTALS, GREENHOUSE OPERATIONS, TURF MANAGEMENT, LAWN MAINTENANCE AND SOD PRODUCTION. PROPER KNOWLEDGE AND PLANNING OF SOIL-DISTURBING ACTIVITIES CAN PREVENTMAJOR IMPACTS ON OTHER RESOURCES. ANIMAL ENTERPRISES IN ALASKA INCLUDE DAIRY, BEEF, SWINE, REINDEER, POULTRY AND NONTRADITIONAL LIVESTOCK SUCH AS MUSKOX, ELK AND BISON. AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND OUTREACH WILL ADDRESS AREAS OF ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, HOME ANIMAL PRODUCTION, AGRONOMIC CROPS INCLUDING OIL SEEDS AND COVER CROPS, AND HOME AND COMMERCIAL VEGETABLE PRODUCTION. AGRICULTURAL SOILS, FERTILIZER AND COMPOST RESEARCH AND OUTREACH ARE ALSO PART OF THIS PROGRAM AREA. AGRICULTURE RESEARCH INCLUDES THE PRIMARY AREAS OF ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HEALTH, HORTICULTURE, SOIL SCIENCE, AND AGROFORESTRY. AS ALASKA EXPANDS ITS IN-STATE CONSUMPTION AND EXPORT MARKETS, PRODUCERS WILL REQUIRE INCREASING ACCESS TO RESEARCH-DERIVED INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO NORTHERN-LATITUDE ENVIRONMENTS AND KNOWLEDGE APPLIED FROM RESEARCH IN OTHER STATES.  AFES USES SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND PUBLICATIONS. AFES COMPLIES WITH SECTIONS 3(C)(1) AND (2) OF THE HATCH ACT AND SECTION 1445 OF NARETPA (HATCH REGULAR CAPACITY FUNDS) BY USING ITS ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC REVIEW PROCESS FOR ALL PROPOSALS AND PUBLICATIONS.

EACH REVIEWER COMPLETES A PEER REVIEW FORM THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC CRITERIA, PROVIDES FOR OTHER COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS, AND MAKES A RECOMMENDATION TO THE DIRECTOR. REVIEWS ARE RETURNED TO THE AUTHOR(S) FOR REVISION IF NEEDED. THE DIRECTOR REVIEWS ALL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REVIEWERS ALONG WITH THE REVISED PROPOSAL/PUBLICATION BEFORE IT IS SENT TO USDA.  THE DIRECTOR CONFIRMS THAT PROPOSALS ARE SENT OUT TO THREE RELATED CONTENT EXPERTS. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS (PIS) ARE ASKED TO SUBMIT NAMES OF REVIEWERS WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THE APPLICABLE FIELD, PREFERABLY FROM ANOTHER LAND GRANT. THE DIRECTOR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT REVIEWERS THAT ARE NOT ON THE LIST. EITHER THE DIRECTOR OR A REVIEWER MAY REQUEST A REREVIEW AFTER MODIFICATION. THEN THE PI IS CLEARED TO WORK WITH THE SITE ADMINISTRATOR TO SUBMIT THE PROPOSAL TO NIFA FOR APPROVAL.  AFES WILL MEET WITH AUDIENCES ON DEMAND THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL SETTINGS EACH YEAR. EXAMPLES OF THESE AUDIENCES INCLUDE AGRICULTURE ASSOCIATIONS, LIVESTOCK ASSOCIATIONS AND REINDEER HERDERS, ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGES, TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS AND REGIONAL CORPORATIONS, BOROUGH AND CITY GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPALITIES, GROWER GROUPS MEETING AT REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE CONFERENCES, INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN FOOD, FIBER AND FUEL/ENERGY PRODUCTION, TRIBAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICTS (TSWCDS) AND SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICTS (SWCDS), AND STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME, ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (INCLUDING THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE), USDA, ARS, AND THE NRCS.

A FIFTH REGIONAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CENTER IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE REMAINS COMMITTED TO THIS STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH A PRESENCE IN ALL 75 ARKANSAS COUNTIES, ENSURING THAT RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION EDUCATORS ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE SCIENCE AND BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE AND THE BROADER NEEDS OF FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE.  CONSISTENT WITH THE LAND GRANT MISSION, DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION FACULTY HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING LEADERSHIP IN THE DEVELOPMENT, DISSEMINATION AND DELIVERY OF INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. DIVISION RESEARCHERS CONDUCT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH FOR ARKANSAS PRODUCERS, BUSINESSES, COMMUNITIES, AND FAMILIES. COUNTY AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS STRIVE TO PROVIDE THE BEST SCIENCE?BASED RECOMMENDATIONS AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH STAKEHOLDERS ARE EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE SOURCES AND COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION AND DATA, THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE REMAINS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF IMPARTIAL AND SCIENCE?BASED RECOMMENDATIONS, INDEPENDENT OF FINANCIAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL INTERESTS.  ALTHOUGH MOST IN?PERSON EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES HAVE RESUMED, THE DIVISION WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER TIMELY AND RESPONSIVE DISTANCE ED UCATION WEBINARS AND RESOURCES IN 2023 TO ENSURE WIDE?SPREAD ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BY ARKANSANS. THIS INCLUDES MONTHLY WEBINARS THROUGH THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL LAW CENTER ON CURRENT AND EMERGING IMPORTANT AGRICULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOOD LAW TOPICS. ONLINE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE 24/7/365 THROUGH THE DIVISION'S WEBSITE (HTTP://COURSES.UADA.EDU). DIVISION FACULTY ALSO ADDRESS TIMELY TOPICS OF INTEREST TO ARKANSANS THROUGH VIRTUAL EVENTS AND OTHER WEB?BASED PROGRAMMING.  THE FOCUS OF WORK CONDUCTED BY THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO BE GUIDED ANNUALLY BY GRASSROOTS, COMMUNITY?BASED INPUT FROM A DIVERSE RANGE OF ARKANSAS CITIZENS; MAINLY THROUGH THE USE OF COUNTY EXTENSION COUNCILS AND OTHER LOCAL AND PROGRAM ADVISORY GROUPS. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE FORMALLY ENGAGED A LARGE POOL OF STAKEHOLDERS (INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL CLIENTELE, PRODUCERS, SCHOOLS, PARTNER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY LEADERS, UNDERSERVED GROUPS, AND LEGISLATORS) IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE 2017?2023 STRATEGIC PLAN. BASED ON BROAD STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK, THE DIVISION IDENTIFIED FIVE AREAS TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS: AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING, ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD, STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES, BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES, AND NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT. THESE FIVE EMPHASIS AREAS HELP TO PROVIDE STRATEGIC LOCAL GUIDANCE FOR DIVISION RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AND HELP TO SUPPORT INTEGRATED RESEARCH/EXTENSION EFFORTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE NIFA SCIENCE EMPHASIS AREAS.  AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING A CRITICAL NEED IN ARKANSAS, AND NATIONWIDE, IS TO ENSURE FARM AND FOREST ENTERPRISES ARE PROFITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE TO MEET THE DEMANDS FOR SAFE FOOD, FIBER, AND FUEL. THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY MUST CONTEND WITH MORE REGULATIONS, HIGHER INPUT COSTS, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, CLIMATE EXTREMES, AND GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IN A HUMANE AND SUSTAINABLE MANNER WHILE DECREASING COSTS THROUGH EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. PLANT SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE ECONOMICS, ENVIRONMENT, GENETICS AND BREEDING, WEEDS, DISEASE, PEST MANAGEMENT, SAFE HANDLING AND STORAGE, FOOD PROCESSING, CULTURAL PRACTICES, AND SOIL FERTILITY.  ANIMAL SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE GENETICS, REPRODUCTION, ECONOMICS, NUTRITION, WASTE MANAGEMENT, PHYSIOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS, HEALTH, AND ANIMAL WELLBEING. COMMON TO BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL SYSTEMS IS THE APPROPRIATE USE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY.  ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOODS THE AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD IS VITAL TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN ALL COMMUNITIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE WORKS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETS THROUGH RESEARCH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS THAT TARGET OBESITY AND ENCOURAGE BETTER CONSUMER HABITS THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE EXPANDED FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM (EFNEP) AND SNAP?ED. EFNEP EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, WITH LIMITED INCOME, TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ATTITUDE, AND BEHAVIOR CHANGES NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN NUTRITIONALLY SOUND DIETS AND ENHANCE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. SNAP?ED PROVIDES NUTRITION EDUCATION TO FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE NUTRITION ASSISTANCE TO HELP CONSUMERS MAKE BETTER CHOICES ABOUT WHAT TO EAT TO STAY ACTIVE AND LIVE BETTER.  THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN FOOD SYSTEMS THROUGH RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. THE LONG TERM GROWTH OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY IN ARKANSAS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE INDUSTRY'S ABILITY TO INNOVATE, TO RESPOND TO CONSUMERS' TASTE AND EXPECTATIONS, TO EMPLOY A QUALITY WORKFORCE AND TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE MAINTAINING ECONOMIC VIABILITY.  PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS AND AGENCIES ARE PURSUED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS FOODS.  EXTENSION PROGRAMS HELP PEOPLE FROM MANY BACKGROUNDS UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE WISE NUTRITIONAL CHOICES AND STRETCH FOOD DOLLARS BY COOKING FOR THEMSELVES AND UTILIZE A WIDER VARIETY OF FOODS.  THE DIVISION ALSO STRIVES TO ENHANCE FOOD SAFETY THROUGH RESEARCH AND TEACHING BEST PRACTICES TO ALL WHO HANDLE FOOD, FROM FIELD TO TABLE. THIS INCLUDES EDUCATION RELATED TO FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, SUCH AS HOW TO ADHERE TO THE FDA'S PRODUCE SAFETY RULE AND MEETING CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THROUGH SERVSAFE, A FOOD SAFETY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN FOOD HANDLING OR FOOD SERVICE AND RELATED INDUSTRIES. EXTENSION EDUCATORS PROVIDE EVIDENCE?BASED INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT ARKANSANS ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE BEST FOOD SAFETY INFORMATION TO KEEP THEIR FAMILIES SAFE FROM FOODBORNE ILLNESSES AND OTHER FOOD?RELATED SAFETY ISSUES.  STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES IT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES THAT AFFECT FAMILIES, CONSUMERS, AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE. THE MENTAL, PHYSICAL, AND FINANCIAL WELL?BEING OF FAMILIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING PROSPERITY FOR ARKANSANS. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE IS RESPONDING TO THESE NEEDS BY DELIVERING RESEARCH?BASED PROGRAMS TO REDUCE STRESS, IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH, STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS, INCREASE FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND IMPROVE WELL?BEING FOR ARKANSANS. 4?H CLUBS, ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS ACROSS ARKANSAS INVOLVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN HANDS?ON EDUCATION AND SERVICE?LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT ENHANCED THEIR LIFE SKILLS, INCLUDING DECISION MAKING, PROBLEM SOLVING, CRITICAL THINKING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES. 4?H CONVEYS TO THE PUBLIC THAT ALL YOUTH HAVE VALUE.  STRIVING TO REACH A DIVERSE POPULATION IS KEY TO DEVELOPING CURRICULUM, OFFERING RECOGNITION, AND TEACHING STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS TO REPRESENT OUR STATE'S CURRENT DEMOGRAPHICS.  BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY, TECHNOLOGY AND POPULATION ARE TRANSFORMING HOW ARKANSANS LIVE AND WORK.  THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND EFFECTIVELY EMPLOY TOOLS AND RESOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LABOR FORCE REQUIRES ENHANCED SKILLS AND TRAINING TO SUCCEED IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY. AT A TIME WHEN MANY RURAL AREAS ARE LOSING POPULATION, COMMUNITIES MUST TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO CREATE A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE. EFFECTIVE AND INCLUSIVE LEADERS WORKING WITH ENGAGED CITIZENS ARE KEY TO THIS EFFORT. TO ADDRESS THESECRITICAL NEEDS, PROGRAMS FOCUS ON FOUR AREAS: ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EVOLVING ECONOMIES; LEADERSHIP AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT; AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE.  NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ARKANSAS FACES CRITICAL NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUES INCLUDING GROUNDWATER DECLINE IN EASTERN ARKANSAS FROM IRRIGATION, WATER QUALITY CONCERNS FROM ANIMAL MANURES, SEDIMENT LOSS FROM CROPLAND AND URBAN STORMWATER. WE ALL SHARE CONCERNS FOR SOIL HEALTH, AIR QUALITY, PROTECTION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OF FORESTS AND WILDLIFE HABITAT, BUT AGRICULTURE IS UNDER SCRUTINY TO REDUCE IMPACT ON NATURAL RESOURCES. WE FOCUS ON UNBIASED RESEARCH AND SCIENCE?BASED EXTENSION EFFORTS TO BALANCE CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. PROGRAMS, SUCH AS ARKANSAS DISCOVERY FARMS AND THE CENTER FOR AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SUSTAINABILITY, WILL COLLABORATE WITH FARMERS, LANDOWNERS, AND INDUSTRY TO DELIVER INNOVATIVE, SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE PROPER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES.  IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO INFORM RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS, THE DIVISION WILL LAUNCH A FORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT IN 2023 TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIES FOR THE ORGANIZATION'S NEW STRATEGIC PLAN WITH INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "07ee21ac-739d-5576-dcac-ca74ea0e4047-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23HFPXXXXXG043_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735899, "Award ID": "NI23HFPXXXXXG042", "Award Amount": 835301.1, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.203", "Description": "THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO CONDUCT AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS AT STATE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS IN THE 50 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND THE INSULAR AREAS.

THE PURPOSE OF THE HATCH PROGRAM IS TO CONDUCT AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS AT STATE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS IN THE 50 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND THE U.S. INSULAR AREAS. HATCH ACTIVITIES ARE BROAD AND INCLUDES RESEARCH ON ALL ASPECTS OF AGRICULTURE, INCLUDING SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION AND USE; PLANT AND ANIMAL PRODUCTION, PROTECTION, AND HEALTH; PROCESSING, DISTRIBUTION, SAFETY, MARKETING, AND UTILIZATION OF FOOD AND A GRICULTURAL PRODUCTS; FORESTRY, INCLUDING RANGE MANAGEMENT AND RANGE PRODUCTS; MULTIPLE USE OF FOREST RANGELANDS, AND URBAN FORESTRY; AQUACULTURE; HOME ECONOMICS AND FAMILY LIFE; HUMAN NUTRITION; RURAL AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT; SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE;MOLECULAR BIOLOGY; AND BIOTECHNOLOGY. RESEARCH MAY BE CONDUCTED ON PROBLEMS OF LOCAL, STATE, REGIONAL, OR NATIONAL CONCERN.  AS OF OCTOBER 2022, UF/IFAS HAS 282 ACTIVE HATCH REGULAR CAPACITY PROJECTS. HIGHLIGHTS FROM A PROJECT WITHIN EACH OF THE PROGRAM'S SIX CRITICAL ISSUES ARE NOTED BELOW:  CRITICAL ISSUE: AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SYSTEMS ASSESSING, EXTRACTING AND MANIPULATING BIOCONTROL AGENTS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT TO MANAGE CROP DISEASES, DIMINISH THE IMPACT OF ABIOTIC STRESSES AND IMPROVE CROP VALUE.  WITH THE GLOBAL POPULATION GROWING AND EXPECTED TO EXCEED 9 BILLION BY 2050, FOOD PRODUCTION NEEDS TO INCREASE BY 70% BY 2050. YIELD GAINS DUE TO MODERN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, SUCH AS PLANT BREEDING AND APPLICATIONS OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS, SEEM TO HAVE REACHED A PLATEAU. THE USE OF BENEFICIAL MICROBIALS IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PESTICIDES APPLIED IN AGRICULTURE, WHICH, TOGETHER WITH OTHER AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, WILL HELP TO PRODUCE FOOD FOR CONSUMERSINA HEALTHIER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE WAY. THIS RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON ASSESSING, EXTRACTING, AND MANIPULATING BACTERIA FROM THE PHYTOBIOME TO MANAGE PLANT DISEASE, IMPROVE NUTRIENT UPTAKE AND DIMINISH THE IMPACT OF ABIOTIC STRESS. IT WILL WORK ON CROPS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT TO GROWERS IN FLORIDA, SUCH AS COMMON BEANS. BY ISOLATING MICROBES AND/OR MANIPULATING THEIR ENVIRONMENT TO FAVOR THE BENEFICIAL ORGANISMS, RESULTS FROM MY RESEARCH ARE EXPECTED TO POTENTIALLY DECREASE THE NEED FOR CHEMICAL AND FERTILIZER APPLICATION, WHILE INCREASING THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD.  THE TARGET AUDIENCE OF THIS RESEARCH IS COMMON BEAN GROWERS WITH FIELDS SUFFERING FROM BIOTIC AND DROUGHT STRESS. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE RESEARCH ARE BACTERIAL ASSEMBLAGE INFORMATION FROM PARTS UNDER DROUGHT STRESS ALONG WITH THE ISOLATION OF MICROBIALS THAT MITIGATE PLANT STRESSES AND PROMOTE PLANT GROWTH.  CRITICAL ISSUE: WATER QUALITY AND CONSERVATION HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS: UNDERSTANDING CAUSAL AND CONTROL FACTORS, RISKS, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT. ALGAL BLOOMS IN AQUATIC SYSTEMS ARE CAUSED BY NUTRIENT (MOSTLY NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS) LOADS FROM THE DRAINAGE BASIN AND WARM WATER. MAJOR SOURCES OF NUTRIENTS INCLUDE RUNOFF FROM AGRICULTURAL, URBAN, AND NATURAL AREAS; SEDIMENTS IN LAKES, CANALS, AND RESERVOIRS; AND ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION. THE TERM \"HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS\" (HABS) REFERS TO THE PROLIFERATION OF A VARIETY OF CYANOBACTERIAL AND DINOFLAGELLATE SPECIES IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. MANY OF THE CYANOBACTERIAL SPECIES PRODUCE TOXINS, WHICH ARE RELEASED INTO THE WATER AND CAN BE TOXIC TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS. THESE TOXINS CAN CAUSE LIVER DYSFUNCTION, PARALYSIS, DEATH BY RESPIRATORY ARREST AND LIVER FAILURE, ASTHMA, SKIN AND EYE IRRITATION, NAUSEA, AND VOMITING, TO NAME A FEW. SINCE HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS FORM IN RESPONSE TO NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT OF RECEIVING WATERBODIES, IDENTIFICATION OF SOURCES OF THESE NUTRIENTS IS IMPERATIVE FOR MANAGING THE OCCURRENCE OF HABS. EXTERNAL SOURCES OF NUTRIENTS ARE OFTEN AMBIGUOUS DUE TO THE EXTENDED DRAINAGE AREAS CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL HYDROLOGY OF SYSTEMS.  NUTRIENTS MAY ALSO ORIGINATE FROM INTERNAL SOURCES OR LEGACY DEPOSITS WITHIN THE WATERBODY. FURTHER COMPLICATING THE IDENTIFICATION OF SOURCES OF NUTRIENTS IS THE FACT THAT THEIR AVAILABILITY TO THE WATER COLUMN IS REGULATED BY COMPLEX NATURAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING, WHICH CAN DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN DIFFERENT PARTS OF A GIVEN WATERBODY, AS WELL AS SEASONALLY. AN INTEGRATED APPROACH CONSIDERING NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY FROM ALL OF THE DIFFERENT SOURCES IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICS OF HAB FORMATION. THIS INFORMATION IS ALSO CRITICALLY NEEDED BEFORE SOURCE?CONTROL AND OTHER MITIGATION METHODS CAN BE IDENTIFIED OR DEVELOPED. IDEALLY, SUSTAINABLE MITIGATION METHODS WILL REDUCE IMPORT OF NUTRIENTS INTO WATERBODIES, STABILIZE OR ISOLATE INTERNAL SOURCES, AND RELY ON NATURAL RESOURCES (AS OPPOSED TO ENGINEERED SYSTEMS). IN ADDITION TO THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SOURCES OF NUTRIENTS, NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY WITHIN THE WATER BODY MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE TROPHIC STATUS WITHIN THE SYSTEM. DEPENDING ON THE PRESENCE AND ACTIVITY OF GRAZERS, THE COMPOSITION AND DENSITY OF ALGAL POPULATIONS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED. FOR EXAMPLE, A LACK OF GRAZING ACTIVITY WOULD ALLOW NUTRIENTS TO BE ASSIMILATED AS ALGAL BIOMASS, WHEREAS ROBUST GRAZING ACTIVITY CONVERTS NUTRIENTS ASSIMILATED FROM THE WATER INTO ANIMAL PROTEIN. IN A SYSTEM WHERE AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS ARE INFLUENCED BY TROPHIC STATUS, THE PRESENCE OF PESTICIDES AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS THAT MAY IMPACT THE HEALTH AND REPRODUCTION OF THE GRAZING COMMUNITY COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALGAL POPULATIONS. LIKEWISE, THE PRESENCE OF HERBICIDES IN THE WATER MAY SELECT FOR MORE TOLERANT ALGAL SPECIES, WHICH MAY BE THOSE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HABS. THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT WILL INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HABS FORM, THE ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC FACTORS INFLUENCING NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AND BLOOM FORMATION, AND POTENTIAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE PRIMARY AUDIENCES INCLUDE SCIENTISTS IN ACADEMIA, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AGENCIES, AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCIES.  CRITICAL ISSUE: NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF INVASIVE WEEDS IN FLORIDA. INVASIVE NON?INDIGENOUS SPECIES IN THE UNITED STATES CAUSE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AND ECONOMIC LOSSES, ESTIMATED AT $120 BILLION/YEAR. INVASIVE PLANTS ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY $35 BILLION OF THESE COSTS. INVASIVE PLANTS ARE DEFINED AS THOSE WHICH ARE NON?NATIVE AND DOES OR IS LIKELY TO CAUSE ECONOMIC OR ENVIRONMENTAL HARM OR HARM TO HUMAN AND/OR ANIMAL HEALTH (EXECUTIVE ORDER 13112: SECTION 1). THE STATE OF FLORIDA SPENT AN AVERAGE OF US $45 MILLION EACH YEAR TO CONTROL INVASIVE WEEDS ON CONSERVATION LANDS FROM 2009?2014 (HIATT ET AL. 2019). DENSITIES OF PLANTS IN THEIR NATIVE RANGES ARE TYPICALLY LIMITED BY AN ASSOCIATION WITH NUMEROUS HERBIVORE AND PATHOGEN NATURAL ENEMIES. HOWEVER, WHEN A PLANT IS INTRODUCED INTO A NEW AREA ITS NATURAL ENEMIES ARE OFTEN LEFT BEHIND. THIS CAN ENABLE THE PLANT TO REACH HIGHER DENSITIES IN THE INTRODUCED RANGE THAN ARE FOUND IN THE NATIVE RANGE. THIS IS REFERRED TO AS THE ENEMY RELEASE HYPOTHESIS (ERH). THE ERH PROVIDES THE RATIONALE BEHIND CLASSICAL BIOLOGICAL CONTROL (CBC), A METHOD USED TO MANAGE INVASIVE PLANTS. IN CBC HOST SPECIFIC INSECTS, OTHER ARTHROPODS AND PLANT DISEASES THAT ATTACK INVASIVES IN THEIR NATIVE RANGES ARE IDENTIFIED AND INTRODUCED TO THE NEW AREA OF INVASION FOR LONG?TERM DENSITY SUPPRESSION. BIOLOGICAL CONTROL IS SAFE BECAUSE THE NATURAL ENEMIES SELECTED FOR RELEASE ARE HOST SPECIFIC DUE TO EXTENSIVE TESTING AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BECAUSE THE USE OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL CAN OFTEN REDUCE THE NEED FOR OTHER CONTROL METHODS THAT ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH NON?TARGET IMPACTS, AND SUSTAINABLE BECAUSE ONCE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS ARE ESTABLISHED ON THE LANDSCAPE THEY REPRODUCE AND MOVE INTO NEW AREAS ON THEIROWN. ONCE NATURAL ENEMIES ARE ESTABLISHED, BIOLOGICAL CONTROL CAN HAVE A HIGH RETURN ON INVESTMENT WITH ECONOMIC RETURNS OF SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS RANGING FROM 5:1 TO > 1,000:1 (NARANJO ET AL., 2015). ADDITIONALLY, WHEN BIOLOGICAL CONTROL IS USED ALONGSIDE OTHER CONTROL METHODS, IT CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAT EITHER CONTROL METHOD ALONE (TIPPING ET AL., 2017, LAKE AND MINTEER, 2018). DURING THIS PROJECT WE INTEND TO PROVIDE SUCCESSFUL BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF INVASIVE PLANTS THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF HOST SPECIFIC NATURAL ENEMIES. INITIAL PLANTS TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE SCHINUS TEREBINTHIFOLIA RADDI (ANACARDIACEAE, BRAZILIAN PEPPERTREE), ACACIA AURICULIFORMIS (FABACEAE, EARLEAF ACACIA), AND DIOSCOREA BULBIFERA L. (DIOSCOREACEAE, AIR POTATO). ADDITIONAL INVASIVE WEEDS MAY ALSO BE TARGETED DURING THIS PROJECT. WE WILL ALSO CONCENTRATE ON MAKING EXISTING BIOLOGICAL CONTROL PROGRAMS MORE EFFECTIVE BY INVESTIGATING WAYS TO COMBINE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL WITH OTHER WEED CONTROL METHODS. TARGET AUDIENCE INCLUDES LANDOWNERS, LAND MANAGERS, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES FOCUSED ON NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, AND COMMODITY GROUPS SUCH AS CATTLE RANCHERS. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS FOR INVASIVE WEEDS IN THE UNITED STATES, IMPROVED CONTROL OF INVASIVE WEEDS THAT HAVE APPROVED BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS AND IMPROVED COLLABORATION AMONG BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF WEEDS PRACTITIONERS IN OTHER STATES TO FACILITATE THE USE OF APPROVED BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS IN AREAS OUTSIDE OF FLORIDA.  CRITICAL ISSUE: NUTRITION, HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY RENAL SNACK: IMPACT ON INFLAMMATION MARKERS AND VITAMIN D STATUS FOR ADULTS ON HEMODIALYSIS. PREMATURE MORTALITY FROM CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE IS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH. EVEN THOUGH FOOD ITEMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO REDUCE PROGRESSION OF THIS DISEASE, INFLAMMATION REMAINS HIGH WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE HIGH DEATH RATES. THIS MIGHT BE DUE TO THE LACK OF RENAL SNACKS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT NOT ONLYCONSIDER PROTEIN, BUT ALSO MICRONUTRIENT CONTENT. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A NOVEL APPROACH TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND IMPROVE MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES TO REDUCE THE PREVALENCE OF PREMATURE MORTALITY AMONG THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. THIS RESEARCH IS STRONGLY COLLABORATIVE IN NATURE; IT WILL PROVIDE EXCELLENT TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS, IN MULTIPLE NUTRITION AND EDUCATION TECHNIQUES, AS WELL AS DATA ANALYSIS. ADDITIONALLY, BY DEVELOPING A VAST NETWORK OF PARTNERSHIPS FROM OTHER UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA DEPARTMENTS AND COLLEGES, THIS ACTIVITY WILL ENHANCE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. THE PROJECT WILL TARGET ADULTS ON DIALYSIS WITHIN ALACHUA COUNTY. ALACHUA COUNTY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE FOCUS FOR THIS PROJECT AS AN ESTIMATED 800 ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF 18 HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CKD PRE?DIALYSIS (SURVEY DATA IDENTIFIED BY UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA'S CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE INSTITUTE (CTSI), 2019), WHICH IS CLOSE TO 1% OF THE ADULTS RESIDING IN THIS COUNTY. ADDITIONALLY, 40% OF THE POPULATION IS CONSIDERED A RACE OTHER THAN WHITE WITH 10% IDENTIFYING AS HISPANIC AND CLOSE TO 20% OF THE POPULATION IS CONSIDERED IN POVERTY STATUS. EXPECTED SHORT?TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO HAVE CREATED A RENAL SNACK PRODUCT THAT IS ACCEPTABLE THROUGH A SENSORY EVALUATION AND MAINTAINS SHAPE AND TEXTURE THROUGH OBJECTIVE TESTS. WE EXPECT THAT THIS RENAL SNACK, WHEN CONSUMED DURING DIALYSIS, WILL REDUCE INFLAMMATION MARKERS AND IMPROVE VITAMIN D STATUS. OTHER OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE: THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS WITHIN THE STUDY, WHICH WILL BE EVALUATED BY THE NUMBER OF CONTACTED COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS, NUMBER OF CONTACTED ADULTS WHO RECEIVE DIALYSIS, NUMBER OF ADULTS ENROLLED IN THE STUDY AND THOSE THAT DROPPED WHETHER IN THE INTERVENTION OR CONTROL.  LONG TERM OUTCOME: OUR LONG?TERM GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A RENAL PRODUCT THAT CAN PROLONG MORTALITY. THIS SNACK, WITH POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE INGREDIENTS, COULD BE PROVIDED TO ADULTS ON DIALYSIS GLOBALLY TO IMPROVE RENAL OUTCOMES AND REDUCE PREMATURE MORTALITY.  CRITICAL ISSUE: FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES INCREASING DISASTER RESILIENCE IN RURAL FLORIDA COMMUNITIES THROUGH COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION. ACCORDING THE 2010 CENSUS DATA, FLORIDA IS CONSIDERED MOSTLY AN URBAN STATE WITH \"POCKETS\" OF RURAL COMMUNITIES LOCATED IN THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE AND SOUTH FLORIDA. BOTH OF THESE AREAS ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS. DUE TO A GENERAL LACK OF KEY RESOURCES IN COMPARISON TO MORE METROPOLITAN COUNTIES, RURAL COUNTIES ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LOSSES CAUSED BY DISASTERS. FLORIDA'S RURAL COUNTIES EXEMPLIFY THIS NEED FOR GREATER ADAPTIVE CAPACITY. PAST DISASTERS LIKE RECENT HURRICANES HAVE REVEALED A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF KEY RESPONSE CAPACITIES IN VITAL AREAS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH, ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT, AND VOLUNTEER AND NONPROFIT COORDINATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A COMMUNITY?BASED MODEL THAT WILL WORK TO INCREASE RESILIENCE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES TO DISASTERS THROUGH EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION.  A STATEWIDE SURVEY OF UF/IFAS EXTENSION FACULTY AND STAFF AND COMMUNITY RESOURCE ORGANIZATIONS (CROS) IN COUNTIES TO COMPARE RURAL VS. URBAN COUNTY RESILIENCE THROUGH IDENTIFIED NEEDS, DISPARITIES, AND BARRIERS IN LIGHT OF RECENT DISASTERS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN YEAR 1. THE PROJECT WILL UTILIZE LISTENING SESSION, ISSUES FORUMS, AND IN?DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH UF/IFAS EXTENSION FACULTY AND STAFF AND CROS TO (A) IDENTIFY COMMUNICATION RESOURCES AND TOOLS USED IN PAST DISASTERS AND (B) DETERMINE PREFERRED COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE UTILIZED DURING DISASTERS IN YEAR 2. BASED UPON YEAR 1 AND YEAR 2 DATA, THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP COMMUNICATION TOOLS AND UTILIZE FOCUS GROUPS WITH UF/IFAS EXTENSION AND CROS FOR TOOLS AND MESSAGE TESTING. DURING YEAR 4 THE PROJECT WILL IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES AND TEST MODEL WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF UF/IFAS EXTENSION AND CROS TO ADDRESS NEEDS, DISPARITIES, AND BARRIERS. IN YEAR 5 WE WILL EVALUATE STRATEGIES UTILIZING RESILIENCY MODEL TO DETERMINE EFFECTIVENESS AND DEVELOP AND CHANGE MODEL BASED ON RESULTS.  TARGET AUDIENCES INCLUDE THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES EXTENSION FACULTY AND STAFF, CROS (NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENT SERVICES, SERVICE PROVIDERS) AND THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK TO MEET THE GAPS AND NEEDS IN THE RURAL COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.  FLORIDA'S RURAL COMMUNITIES EXEMPLIFY A NEED FOR GREATER ADAPTIVE CAPACITY IN PREPARING FOR, MITIGATING, AND RECOVERING FROM DISASTERS. PAST DISASTERS LIKE THE DWH OIL SPILL AND RECENT HURRICANES HAVE REVEALED A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF KEY RESPONSE CAPACITIES IN VITAL AREAS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH, ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT, AND VOLUNTEER AND NONPROFIT COORDINATION. OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE PROVIDING RURAL FL COMMUNITIES WITH RESEARCH?BASED TOOLS AND PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS THESE AREAS IN TIMES OF DISASTERS.  CRITICAL ISSUE: YOUTH PROXIMAL PROCESSES AND YOUTH RESILIENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF FAMILIES, SCHOOLS, AND COMMUNITIES THIS STUDY WILL FOCUS ON THE ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY DATA TO EXPLORE HOW PROTECTIVE FACTORS OPERATE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE RESILIENCY AND POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR AT?RISK YOUTH. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, BOTH VARIABLE?CENTERED AND PERSON?CENTERED ANALYSES WILL BE USED DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS. FURTHER, THESE ANALYSES WILL BE INTEGRATED SUCH THAT THE BENEFITS OF BOTH APPROACHES ARE REALIZED AND A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF YOUTH RESILIENCE IS REALIZED. THIS STUDY WILL CONSISTOF MULTIPLE SECONDARY DATA ANALYSES DRAWING FROM EXISTING NATIONAL DATASETS THAT INCLUDE APPROPRIATE POPULATIONS AND VARIABLES, INCLUDING: LONGITUDINAL PATHWAYS TO RESILIENCE IN MALTREATED CHILDREN. THIS DATASET, AVAILABLE FROM THE NATIONAL DATA ARCHIVE ON CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT, INCLUDES LONGITUDINAL DATA FROM \"300 SIX? TO TWELVE?YEAR?OLD LOW INCOME, MALTREATED AND NON?MALTREATED CHILDREN\" WITH MULTIPLE FOLLOW?UPS. VARIABLES INCLUDE INFORMATION ON \"CHILDREN'S ADAPTATION AND CURRENT SYMPTOMATOLOGY,\" HISTORY OF MALTREATMENT, AND CHILD OUTCOMES. HTTPS://WWW.NDACAN.ACF.HHS.GOV/DATASETS/DATASET?DETAILS.CFM?ID=110 NATIONAL YOUTH IN TRANSITION DATABASE: (NYTD): THIS DATASET, AVAILABLE FROM THE NATIONAL DATA ARCHIVE ON CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT, INCLUDES \"THE RESULTS OF SURVEYS CONDUCTED WITH YOUTH TO EXAMINE CERTAIN WELL?BEING, FINANCIAL, AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AS THEY GET OLDER.\" IT INCLUDES THREE PHASES OF DATA COLLECTION (AGE 17, 19, AND 21) FOR YOUTH IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. IT INCLUDES INFORMATION ON \"FINANCIAL SELF?SUFFICIENCY, EDUCATION, ADULT CONNECTIONS, HOMELESSNESS, HIGH?RISK BEHAVIORS, AND ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE.\" HTTPS://WWW.HEALTHYPEOPLE.GO V/2020/DATA?SOURCE/NATIONAL?YOUTH?IN?TRANSITION?DATABASE  FOR EACH DATASET, THE RESEARCHER WILL GAIN ACCESS TO THE DE?IDENTIFIED DATA FROM THE NATIONAL DATA ARCHIVE ON CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT (NDACAN). NDACAN WILL SHARE THE DATA THROUGH THEIR SECURE WEBSITE, WHICH IS ACCESSED WITH A UNIQUE USERNAME AND PASSWORD. THE INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY THE PRIMARY RESEARCHERS, WITH YOUTH AGES 5 TO 14 BEING INCLUDED IN THE STUDY, CONDUCT A COMBINATION OF PERSON?CENTERED ANALYSIS (LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS, LATENT PROFILE ANALYSIS, OR OTHER CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES) ALONG WITH TYPICAL VARIABLE?CENTERED ANALYSIS (DESCRIPTIVE, ANOVA, REGRESSION, ETC.) AS APPROPRIATE. ANALYSES WILL BE CONDUCTED ON DE?IDENTIFIED DATA USING MPLUS AND SPSS AND SUBMIT ARTICLES FOR PRESENTATION AND PUBLICATION.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE GEORGIA PLAN OF WORK (POW) ENCOMPASSES A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2022. THE PLAN ADDRESSES MAJOR AGRICULTURAL ISSUES AS WELL AS MANY OTHER PROBLEMS FACING RURAL AND URBAN AREAS, THE ENVIRONMENT, FAMILIES AND YOUTH. THE PLAN REPRESENTS A COORDINATED EFFORT BETWEEN THE STATE'S 1890 AND 1862 LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS, FORT VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY (FVSU) AND THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA (UGA), AND INCLUDES JOINT PLANNING BETWEEN EXPERIMENT STATIONS AND COOPERATIVE EXTENSION UNITS AT BOTH UNIVERSITIES. GEORGIA, ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 13 COLONIES, HAS A LAND AREA OF 57,701 SQUARE MILES AND A WATER AREA OF 1,706 SQUARE MILES, WHICH MAKES IT THE LARGEST STATE EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER (21TH OVERALL). GEORGIA FALLS WITHIN FIVE MAJOR PHYSIOGRAPHIC REGIONS: THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHEAST; THE RIDGE AND VALLEY PROVINCE AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU IN THE NORTHWEST; THE PIEDMONT ACROSS CENTRAL GEORGIA; AND THE COASTAL PLAIN IN THE SOUTH. ELEVATIONS RANGEFROM SEA LEVEL TO 4,784 FEET AT BRASSTOWN BALD IN THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS. THE 2020 CENSUS ESTIMATED GEORGIA'S POPULATION WAS 10,711,908 AND REPORTED 23.8% OF GEORGIANS ARE UNDER AGE 18 AND 13.9% ARE 65 OR OLDER. ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS,51.9% OF GEORGIANS IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS WHITE/CAUCASIAN, 31% AS BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN, 4.5% AS ASIAN,.5% AS AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE, .1% AS NATIVE HAWAIIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER, AND 6.9% AS MORE THAN ONE RACE. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT 10.5% OF GEORGIANS IDENTIFY AS HISPANIC OR LATINO.  GEORGIA'S COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM HAS 167 OFFICES, WITH PROGRAMMING IN ALL OF GEORGIA'S 159 COUNTIES. FVSU AND UGA PERSONNEL ARE HOUSED JOINTLY IN COUNTY OFFICES. EXTENSION DELIVERS PROGRAMMING IN AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES, AND 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AS BOTH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY EFFORTS AND AS MULTICOUNTY PROGRAMS. STATE FACULTY MEMBERS DELIVER TRAINING TO COUNTY AGENTS AND PROGRAMMING DIRECTLY TO CLIENTELE, WHEN APPROPRIATE.FVSU AND UGA RESEARCH PROGRAMS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION SYSTEM. GEORGIA HAS SEVERAL CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE; ITS FOUR LARGEST ARE LOCATED IN ATHENS, FORT VALLEY, TIFTON AND GRIFFIN. GEORGIA HAS ELEVEN RESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS STRATEGICALLY LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS JOINT PLAN OF WORK WAS DEVELOPED AROUND CORE PROGRAMS AND TARGETED ISSUES. USING A STRUCTURED PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM, GEORGIA DEVELOPS CORE PROGRAM DIRECTIONS AND IDENTIFIES TARGETED ISSUES. THE GEORGIA PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS A MULTISTEP PROCESS THAT IS OPERATIONAL EVERY YEAR. THE MODEL INCLUDES A METHOD FOR ASSESSING NEEDS AND IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS. IT ALSO INCLUDES PROGRAM EVALUATION TO DETERMINE IMPACT. THE GEORGIA PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MODEL WORKS IN UNISON WITH MULTIPLE ADVISORY SYSTEMS AT BOTH COUNTY AND STATE LEVELS.  INPUT SOLICITED DIRECTLY FROM ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AT FVSU'S COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE, FAMILY SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS UGA'S COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES (CAES) AND COLLEGE OF FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES AS PART OF THE ANNUAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF DEVELOPING THIS PLAN OF WORK. FACULTY MEMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PLAN ARE WORKING ON CUTTING-EDGE PROGRAMS. THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION AND INPUT FROM BOTH THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE AND PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE. THIS INPUT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AS IS A STRONG ADVISORY SYSTEM.  THE GEORGIA FEDERAL PLAN OF WORK DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE ALL OF THE WORK OF THE COLLEGES' FACULTY MEMBERS. IT IS INTENDED TO DOCUMENT THE PLANS AND ACTIONS OF THE FACULTY MEMBERS RECEIVING SPECIFIC FORMULA FUNDS. THE MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS ARE USED TO SUPPORT STATE-LEVEL CORE PROGRAMS. THESE CORE PROGRAMS COVER A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL ANIMAL AND PLANT PRODUCTION, POSITIVE YOUTH AND FAMILY DEVELOPMENT, URBAN AGRICULTURE, PERSONAL HEALTH AND WELL- BEING, AND EMERGING ISSUES, SUCH AS BIOFUELS. THE GOALS OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE TO DEMONSTRATE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPACT. HOWEVER, THE GREATEST IMPACTS OF THESE CORE PROGRAMS ARE THE FOUNDATIONS CREATED TO SUPPORT AND LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BEYOND STATE-MATCHING FUNDS. THE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING, COUNTY FUNDING, GRANTS AND GIFTS LEVERAGED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE WORK IN THIS PLAN MAY CREATE THE GREATEST FINAL IMPACT. MOST OF GEORGIA'S PLANNED PROGRAMS INCLUDE OUTCOME MEASURES THAT TRACK THE OUTPUT LEVELS OF LEVERAGED PROGRAMMING. THE OUTPUTS OF THESE LEVERAGED PROGRAMS ARE CONSIDERED A DIRECT, SHORT-TERM OUTCOME OF THE CORE PLANNED PROGRAMS WITHIN THE GEORGIA FEDERAL PLAN OF WORK.  THE GEORGIA FEDERAL PLAN OF WORK IS CENTERED ON EIGHT PLANNED PROGRAMS. THESE WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT ISSUES ON COUNTY, STATE, REGIONAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVELS.  ANIMAL PRODUCTION THIS PLAN OF WORK WILL EXPLORE DIFFERENT AREAS OF ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND PROTECTION, FOCUSING ON THE PRODUCTION OF SHEEP, GOATS, DAIRY AND BEEF CATTLE, SWINE,POULTRY, AQUACULTURE, AND SMALL RUMINANTS.

MAJOR COMPONENTS IN THE PLANNED PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TARGET YOUTH AND FAMILIES AT RISK. OTHER COMPONENTS TARGET SMALL PRODUCERS, LIMITED RESOURCES FARMERS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES.  II. MERIT / PEER REVIEW PROCESS UGA CAES AND FVSU INDEPENDENTLY AND COLLABORATIVELY CONDUCT PERIODIC, EXTENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS OF THEIR RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS. THESE REVIEWS COLLECT BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INPUT, INCLUDING INPUT FROM FACULTY AND STAFF, CLIENTELE, ALUMNI AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. THE RESULTS OF THESE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN USED TO FORMULATE THIS PLAN OF WORK. ADDITIONALLY, THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE SOUGHT GUIDANCE FROM THE UGA CAES ADVISORY SYSTEM AND THE FVSU CAFST ADVISORY BOARD THROUGH THEIR CRITICAL REVIEW OF PROGRAMS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.  THIS PLAN OF WORK IS UNDER CONTINUOUS REVIEW BY THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TEAM, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT SPECIALISTS AND COORDINATORS FROM AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES AND 4- H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS FACULTY FROM BOTH FVSU AND UGA. THIS REVIEW IS AN ONGOING PROCESS, AND FUTURE ANNUAL REVIEWS AND CHANGES TO THE PLAN OF WORK WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS TEAM.  THE RESEARCH PORTION OF THE PLAN OF WORK UNDERGOES SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PRIOR TO EACH PROJECT BEING SUBMITTED. ALL SCIENTISTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ACTIVE PROJECTS FOR EXPENDITURES TO BE MADE. EACH PROJECT IS PEER-REVIEWED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL REVIEWERS AND MUST BE APPROVED BY THE APPROPRIATE DEAN AND DIRECTOR PRIOR TO SUBMISSION TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE.  III. STAKEHOLDER INPUT 1. ACTIONS TO SEEK SURVEYS ARE USED AT THE PLANNED PROGRAM LEVEL. INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND SHARED AS PART OF THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE ADVISORY SYSTEM REQUIRES THAT FACULTY SEEK PARTICIPATION BY NONTRADITIONAL STAKEHOLDER INDIVIDUALS. GEORGIA'S ADVISORY SYSTEM ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF THE COMMUNITY.  2. METHODS TO IDENTIFY FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION IDENTIFY ORGANIZATIONS MADE UP OF DIRECT STAKEHOLDERS OR POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS IN ADDRESSING COMMUNITY ISSUES. INPUT IS SOUGHT FROM STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR DEDICATION TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COLLEGE. COUNTY PROGRAMS IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WITH THE ABILITY TO REPRESENT DIVERSE CURRENT OR POTENTIAL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY. RACE, ETHNICITY, INCOME OR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST MAY BE USED TO IDENTIFY THESE GROUPS.  3. METHODS TO COLLECT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, ADVISORY COMMITTEES MEET BY PROGRAM AREA TO CUMULATIVELY IDENTIFY ISSUES; PLAN, EXECUTE AND EVALUATE PROGRAMS; AND COMMUNICATE RESULTS TO THE COMMUNITY.  WHEN MAKING HIRING DECISIONS, COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF ACTIVE STAKEHOLDERS ARE SOLICITED VIA EMAIL SURVEY.  4. HOW CONSIDERED STAKEHOLDER INPUT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF GEORGIA'S PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MODEL. STAKEHOLDER INPUT IS CURRENTLY USED FOR PROGRAM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES, AND TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE RESOURCE LEVELS DIRECTED TOWARD SPECIFIC PLANNED PROGRAMS. STAKEHOLDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AS A TOOL TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE AND SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM. STAKEHOLDERS ARE ALSO PART OF FUND DEVELOPMENT AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS.  IV.

IT HAS HIGH RESEARCH ACTIVITY, IS A COMPREHENSIVE DOCTORAL UNIVERSITY, AND HAS CARNEGIE RESEARCH 1 CLASSIFICATION. AUBURN'S MISSION IS DEFINED BY ITS LAND-GRANT TRADITIONS OF SERVICE AND ACCESS. AUBURN SERVES THE CITIZENS OF ALABAMA THROUGH ITS INSTRUCTIONAL, RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AND PREPARES ALABAMIANS TO RESPOND SUCCESSFULLY TO THE CHALLENGES OF A GLOBAL ECONOMY.  THE ALABAMA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (AAES) AT AUBURN UNIVERSITY WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1883 THROUGH AN ACT OF THE ALABAMA LEGISLATURE TO CONDUCT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT WOULD ADVANCE ALABAMA'S AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY INDUSTRIES. AAES RESEARCHERS CONDUCT INNOVATIVE FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED (MISSION-ORIENTED) RESEARCH THAT SUPPORTS THE ADVANCEMENT OF ALABAMA'S AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY INDUSTRIES, FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE AND WELL-BEING OF CITIZENS AND COMMUNITIES OF ALABAMA AND BEYOND. AAES OPERATIONS ARE SUPPORTED WITH FUNDING SUPPORTFROM THE USDA NIFA HATCH FUNDING PROGRAM AND THE STATE OF ALABAMA.  THE WORLD AND THE STATE OF ALABAMA ARE FACING MAJOR CHALLENGES WITH POPULATION SHIFTS, FOOD, WATER, ENERGY, AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, RURAL PROSPERITY AND RESILIENCE, BIOSECURITY, NATURAL RESOURCES, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ALL SECTORS, AS WELL AS HUMAN HEALTH AND WELL- BEING AND RELATED ISSUES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THESE MAJOR LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES, INTEGRATIVE AND COLLABORATIVE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO ADDRESS MOST OF THESE CHALLENGES. THROUGH LISTENING SESSIONS, FACULTY MEETINGS, FOCUS GROUPS, CONFERENCES, FIELD DAYS, AND SELECTED ADVISORY BOARDS, OUR PROGRAMS ARE PLANNED TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUES OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO AGRICULTURE IN ALABAMA, THE NATION, AND THE WORLD. ALL PLANNED PROGRAMS ARE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT OF RELEVANCE TO ALL RESIDENTS OF ALABAMA WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM THELOCAL KNOWLEDGE BASE OR SERVICE. THROUGH THE CRITICAL ISSUES, KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN RESEARCH, INCLUDING EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES AND EDUCATIONAL DELIVERY MECHANISMS, WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND ADDRESSED. RELATIVE TO ALL AC TIVITIES, PROGRAMS WILL BE COMMUNICATED IN VARYING WAYS TO STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE ADOPTED AS APPROPRIATE.  OUR PROGRAMS ARE PLANNED TO BE ALIGNED WITH NIFA'S RESEARCH PRIORITY AREAS AND WITH ALABAMA'S AGRICULTURAL NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED BY ST AKEHOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THE ALIGNMENT, THE FOCUS WILL BE ON THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ISSUES:  GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND HUNGER THE GOAL IS TO ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES IN ALABAMA THROUGH DEVELOPMENT AND IMP LEMENTATION OF BEST PRACTICES OR TECHNOLOGIES. THIS CRITICAL ISSUE ADDRESSES TWO BROADLY DEFINED PRIORITY AREAS: I) PLANT HEALTH AND PRODUCTION AND PLANT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IMPROVED CROPPING SYSTEMS, PLANT BREEDING/GENOMICS, INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT, AND ALTERNATIVE SPECIALTY CROPS; AND II) ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IMPROVED FOOD-ANIMAL SYSTEMS AND STOCKS, AND ALTERNATIVES TO ANTIBIOTIC USE. OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH INCLUDE ORGANIC AGRICULTURE AND LOCAL FOODS, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, AND NEEDS OF LIMITED RESOURCE PRODUCERS. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE PROJECTS THAT PRESENT INNOVATIVE SYNERGIES OF DISCIPLINES AND PERSPECTIVES.  NATURAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY THIS PROGRAM PLAN WILL GENERATE KNOWLEDGE TO MANAGE AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL SYSTEMS IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND FACILITATE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCES. SPECIFIC AREAS INCLUDE: SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS, ENERGY CONSERVATION AND UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES; UNDERSTANDING THE LAND-WATER INTERFACE; CONSEQUENCES AND SOLUTIONS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE; WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY, CARBON SEQUESTRATION, FOREST LAND AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT; NATURAL SYSTEMS RESTORATION, SURFACE AND GROUND WATER CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL WASTE RESIDUE; CHEMICAL AND ELECTRONIC WASTE IN URBAN AND RURAL SETTINGS; SUSTAINABLE SOIL HEALTH ENHANCEMENT; SUSTAINABLE ECO- AND AGRI-TOURISM; RURAL-URBAN INTERFACE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES; REMOTE SENSING AND PRECISION AGRICULTURE.  FOOD SYSTEMS AND FOOD SAFETY RESEARCH ACTIVITIES THAT ENHANCE FOOD SYSTEMS, FOOD SAFETY AND AGRICULTURAL BIOSECURITY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM AREA IS TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY AND METHODS TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD, TO ENHANCE FOOD SAFETY, REDUCE EPIDEMICS OF FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS, AND TO DEVELOP THE KNOWLEDGE AND A METHODOLOGIES BASE FOR RAPID DETECTION OF THREAT AGENTS, INCLUDING EXISTING AND EMERGING DISEASES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS, RISK ASSESSMENT, AND FACILITY AND PERSONNEL SECURITY. THIS PROGRAM AREA WILL FOCUS ON APPROACHES THAT EDUCATE INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT AND CONSUMERS ON HOW TO AVOID FOOD-BORNE DISEASES; SAFE HOME FOOD PRESERVATION; AND EDUCATING FOOD HANDLERS AND PROCESSORS ON HOW TO ENSURE SAFE FOOD PRODUCTS ALL ALONG THE FOOD CHAIN.  SUSTAINABLE ENERGY AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH IN ALABAMA WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL GOAL OF ENERGY INDEPENDENCE BY SUPPORTING SCIENCE TO DEVELOP BIOMASS USED FOR BIOFUELS, DESIGN OPTIMUM FOREST PRODUCTS AND CROPS FOR BIOENERGY PRODUCTION, AND PRODUCE VALUE-ADDED BIO-BASED INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS. SPECIFIC AREAS OF RESEARCH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING: ALTERNATIVE CROPS FOR EFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF BIOENERGY FEEDSTOCK; BIOTECHNOLOGY OF BIOENERGY CROPS TO ENHANCE PRODUCTION OR TO ENHANCE ITS UTILIZATION AS AN ENERGY SOURCE; AND, TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FOR BIOENERGY CONVERSION. THIS PRIORITY IS ALIGNED WITH THE USDA PRIORITY AREA OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY AND WITH THE HUGE DOMESTIC ENERGY DEMANDS.  HUMAN NUTRITION, WELL-BEING, HEALTH AND OBESITY DISEASES SUCH AS OBESITY, DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, AND VASCULAR ISSUES ARE MOSTLY CAUSED BY THE LACK OF NUTRIENTS, THE LACK OF EXERCISE, POOR LIFESTYLE CHOICES, AND STRESS OF THE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS. AS A RESULT OFTHE GROWING HEALTH CONCERNS FOR ALABAMA CITIZENS, THERE HAS BEEN A COMBINED EFFORT TO EDUCATE AND MOTIVATE CITIZENS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO MAKE BETTER HEALTH DECISIONS. HEALTH DISPARITIES/INEQUITIES ARE INFLUENCED BY THE LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE, ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, AND THE ABILITY TO SELF-MANAGE. THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF ALABAMIANS, TARGETING LIMITED-RESOURCE FAMILIES, THROUGH CHRONIC DISEASE AWARENESS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, NUTRITION EDUCATION, HEALTH LITERACY AND ACCESS TO AND CONSUMPTION OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.  COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES WILL ASSIST IN PREPARING AN ALABAMA WORKFORCE COMPRISED OF MOTIVATED INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE EMPLOYMENT TRANSITIONS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFESPAN. THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO WORKFORCE PREPARATION ARE TO CONNECT LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, SCHOOLS, COMMUNITY GROUPS, LABOR, EMPLOYERS, AND OTHERS, TO FURTHER THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH AND ADULTS.

THE PRIORITY RESEARCH AREAS ARE: (1) ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE TO A CHANGING CLIMATE: FOR EXAMPLE, HATCH PROJECT ACCESSION NO. 1018780 SUPPORTED AQUATIC INVASIVE PLANT SURVEYS IN 15 LAKES AND PONDS AS WELL AS THE CONNECTICUT RIVER. COMPARING INVASIVE PLANT MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES, WE REPORT THAT DEEP AND LONG DRAWDOWNS OF THE WATER LEVEL DURING WINTER PROVIDE GOOD SHORT-TERM CONTROL OF INVASIVE PLANTS. THIS FINDING WILL BE USED TO INFORM MANAGEMENT OF INVASIVE PLANTS IN CT WATERWAYS AS CLIMATE CHANGE PERMITS THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PLANTS. , (2) ENHANCING HEALTH AND WELL-BEING: FOR EXAMPLE, HATCH PROJECT ACCESSION NUMBER 1021837 FOUND THAT TREATING MOSQUITO HABITATS WITH LARVICIDES EFFECTIVELY DECREASED THE ABUNDANCE OF WEST NILE VIRUS VECTOR LARVAE IN TWO CONNECTICUT TOWNS. HOWEVER, THIS DID NOT AFFECT THE OVERALL PREDICTED RISK LEVEL FOR WEST NILE VIRUS. THIS STUDY WILL HELP STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR FUTURE DECISION MAKING ON MOSQUITO CONTROL PROGRAMS. (3) SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SUPPLY: FOR EXAMPLE, HATCH PROJECT ACCESSION 1025562 AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF ORNAMENTAL PESTICIDES ON HONEYBEES. BY CHEMICAL, GENETIC, AND MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF POLLEN COLLECTED FROM BEES THAT VISITED NURSERIES, THE STUDY FOUND THAT BEES WERE ONLY COLLECTING A SMALL PORTION OF THEIR POLLEN FROM THE NURSERIES, AND THAT ONLY A FEW OF THE NURSERY PESTICIDES COULD BE DETECTED IN THE BEE POLLEN. THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR NURSERY MANAGERS AND BEEKEEPERS IN CONNECTICUT, AS THEY MAKE DECISIONS TO KEEP THE FOOD SUPPLY SAFE. (4) SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPES ACROSS URBAN-RURAL INTERFACES: HERE, CAES RESEARCHERS STUDIED IMPROVED METHODS FOR TREATMENT AND A NALYSIS OF AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF AND WASTEWATER. FOR EXAMPLE, HATCH PROJECT ACCESSION NUMBER 1018681 FOUND THAT A HARMLESS BIODEGRADABLE MOLECULE CALLED PICA (PICOLINIC ACID) IS A SAFER AND MORE EFFECTIVE REPLACEMENT FOR THE USE OF IRON SALTS IN TREATMENT OF WASTEWA TER. THE HATCH PROJECT ACCESSION 1019062 HELPED DEVELOP NEW SOFTWARE AND METHODS FOR SCREENING OF PFAS, A WIDESPREAD CONTAMINANT IN AGRICULTURAL SOIL AND DRINKING WATER.

THE RESEARCH EXPRESSED IN THE PROGRAM AREAS IS THE RESULT OF COOPERATION AMONG RESEARCHERS WITHIN AND BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS AND COLLEGES AT ALL LEVELS OF ACTIVITY. CONTINUING DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES, GLOBALIZATION, AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS CREATE ONGOING O PPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES TOWARD ACHIEVING SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL, ECONOMICALLY SUCCESSFUL, AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND SYSTEMS FOR FOOD, FEED, FIBER, FUEL, AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS. TO THIS END, IOWA STATE HAS IDENTIFIED SIX, LONG-TERM CRITICAL ISSUES THAT OUR RESEARCH PROJECTS AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. RESEARCH IN EACH OF THESE AREAS IS BEING CONDUCTED ON RELEVANT AND TIMELY ISSUES THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS, THE BIO-AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY, LOCAL, STATE AND NATIONAL POLICY-MAKERS, AS WELL AS CONSUMERS. FOOD PRODUCTION AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS: WITHIN THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM, ISU SCIENTISTS ARE DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES, AND IMPROVING CURRENT STRATEGIES, THAT MITIGATE PEST AND WEED DAMAGE TO AGRONOMIC PRODUCTS, CREATE DISEASE AND CLIMATE-RESISTANT CROPS, ENHANCE FOOD-ANIMAL PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, REDUCE BIOPRODUCT WASTE STREAMS FROM AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, AND PREDICT WEATHER AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. IN THE AREA OF PEST MANAGEMENT, WORK IS BEING DONE TO UNDERSTAND THE PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY OF PEST SPECIES THAT CAN BE EXPLOITED AS NOVEL STRATEGIES FOR MANAGEMENT OF INSECT POPULATIONS. OTHER WORK EMPHASIZES THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF NOVEL CHEMICALS FOR PEST MANAGEMENT, ESPECIALLY THOSE DERIVED FROM PLANTS TO CREATE NEW WAYS OF USING PLANT PRODUCTS TO KILL, KNOCK DOWN, OR REPEL PESTS, AS WELL TESTING PLANT PRODUCTS THAT ENHANCE THE POTENCY OF CONVENTIONAL INSECTICIDES. SCIENTISTS ARE ALSO WORKING TO DETERMINE THE FATE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGROCHEMICALS USED IN PROTECTION OF FOOD AND FIBER CROPS, AND THEIR IMPACT ON INSECTS, TICKS, MITES, AND OTHER INVERTEBRATE ANIMALS TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY. OTHER RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON CHARACTERIZING RESISTANCE TO BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS (BT) CORN BY POPULATIONS OF WESTERN CORN ROOTWORM TO STUDY FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPREAD OF BT RESISTANCE WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE BY THIS PEST. BY UNDERSTANDING THE AGRO-ECOLOGY OF THE CORN CROPPING SYSTEM IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO REDUCE YIELD LOSSES CAUSED BY THIS KEY PEST IN THE US CORN BELT. RESEARCH THUS FAR HAS PROVIDED FARMERS WITH TIMELY INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR CORN ROOTWORM AND OTHER PESTS OF CORN. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGY OF CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WEEDS THAT IMPACT AGRICULTURAL YIELDS, SCIENTISTS ARE DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE CONSISTENT C ONTROL, SLOW ADAPTION OF THESE WEEDS, AND REDUCE THE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF WEED MANAGEMENT. TOOLS ARE BEING DEVELOPED WHICH FARMERS AND THE AG INDUSTRY CAN ACCESS TO IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO ADDRESS WEED INVASION EARLIER AND ADDRESS IT MORE QUICKLY. IN SUPPORT OF CREATING DISEASE AND CLIMATE RESISTANT CROPS, SCIENTISTS ARE UTILIZING GENETIC VARIATION MORE EFFICIENTLY, TO DEVELOP PROCEDURES AIMED AT MAXIMIZING GENETIC GAIN. INFORMATION FROM THOSE INITIATIVES WILL ENABLE BREEDERS TO MORE RAPIDLY TRANSFER GENES INTO ELITE GENE POOLS FOR CULTIVAR DEVELOPMENT. OTHER WORK IS ADDRESSING THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT STRESS ON CROP PLANTS DURING REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT. REPRODUCTION IS WHEN PLANTS ARE MOST SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS SUCH AS DROUGHT. UNDERSTANDING THE GENETIC MECHANISMS THAT REGULATE REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT WILL ALLOW THE BREEDING OF PLANTS ADAPTED FOR STABLE YIELDS UNDER VARIABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THIS WORK HAS LED TO IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONALLY CHARACTERIZED GENETIC NETWORKS, INDIVIDUAL REGULATORS, BIOSYNTHETIC GENES ANDHORMONE-RESPONSIVE GENES THAT PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN PLANT DEVELOPMENT AND TOLERANCE TO ABIOTIC STRESS. RESEARCH TO ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF SUSTAINABLE BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS REQUIRES PLANT CELL WALL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION. SCIENTISTS ARE EXPLORING BOTH FIRST GENERATION PLANT-BASED BIOFUELS AND NEXT GENERATION WOODY/HERBACEOUS BIOFUELS AS WELL AS OTHER BIOPRODUCTS IN ORDER TO BROADEN THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PLANT POLYSACCHARIDE FORMATION. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ASPECTS OF FOOD-ANIMAL PRODUCTION, PROJECTS ARE UNDERWAY THAT DEFINE CHEMICAL, BIOCHEMICAL, METABOLIC, AND PHYSICAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE QUALITY AND VALUE OF FRESH MEAT AND RAW MATERIALS USED FOR VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS. THIS WORK IS DEVELOPING NOVEL NON-MEAT INGREDIENT, PROCESSING AND PACKAGING SYSTEMS TO ENABLE QUALITY, NUTRITIONAL AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS OF PROCESSED AND VALUE-ADDED MEAT AND POULTRY PRODUCTS. AS PART OF THIS WORK, THE IMPACT OF PROCESS INTERVENTIONS ON THE LEVEL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL CONTAMINATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY OF IOWA CROPPING SYSTEMS INCLUDING CORN, SOYBEAN, PERENNIAL AND ANNUAL COVE R CROPS IS A CURRENT RESEARCH FOCUS. THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FORECAST AND ASSESSMENT OF CROPPING SYSTEMS WEB TOOL ALLOWS AGRONOMIC INFORMATION IN REAL TIME TO BE DISSEMINATED IN SUPPORT OF PRODUCERS, DECISION MAKERS AND THE AG INDUSTRY. INFORMATION IN THE PROGRAM INCLUDES STATEWIDE MAPS FOR SOIL MOISTURE BY DEPTH AND SOIL N MINERALIZATION ACROSS IOWA, ILLINOIS, AND INDIANA. A LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS OF EARTH'S LAND SURFACE THAT WILL FACILITATE BETTER WEATHER AND CLIMATE FORECASTS FOR THE CORN BELT OF THE MIDWEST UNITED STATES. THESE FORECASTS WILL BE USED TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT INCREASE THE PROFITABILITY OF AGRICULTURE WHILE MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE REGION'S NATURAL RESOURCES. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED BY PRODUCERS, SCIENTISTS, AND FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TO BETTER QUANTIFY THE MOVEMENT OF WATER BETWEEN THE LAND SURFACE AND THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH PLANT TRANSPIRATION, THUS IMPROVING WEATHER AND CLIMATE FORECASTS, AND TO MONITOR CROP PROGRESS AND OTHER MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CROP PRODUCTION IN THE CORN BELT THAT IMPACT CROP YIELD AND CONSEQUENTLY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP: ISU RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING TOOLS AND STRATEGIES THAT CONSERVE NATURAL RESOURCES AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. WILDLIFE DISEASES ARE RECEIVING INCREASED ATTENTION DUE TO AWARENESS OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF WILDLIFE IN DISEASES AFFECTING HUMANS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS, RECOGNITION THAT DISEASE CAN HAVE IMPORTANT IMPACTS ON WILDLIFE CONSERVATION, AND APPRECIATION THAT DISEASE IS AN IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL FACTOR SHAPING POPULATION AND, IN SOME CASES, ECOSYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL RESULT IN INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE IN WILDLIFE POPULATIONS THAT WILL ENHANCE THE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF WILDLIFE POPULATIONS AND PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. RESEARCH IS BEING UNDERTAKEN TO CHARACTERIZE THE BIODIVERSITY AND SYSTEMATICS OF AQUATIC INSECTS, PARTICULARLY AQUATIC DIPTERA (TRUE FLIES). A USER-BASED WEBSITE, BUGGUIDE, HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AS A VOLUNTEER-BASED TAXONOMIC GUIDE TO ARTHROPODS OF NORTH AMERICA THAT IS HOSTED BY IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY AND CURRENTLY INCLUDES OVER 1.6 MILLION USER-CONTRIBUTED IMAGES, NEARLY 60,000 TAXON PAGES, AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MORE THAN 44,000 INDIVIDUALS. IN OTHER WORK, THE IMPACT OF HUMAN AND NATURAL FORCES IN THE DETERMINATION OF NATURAL FISH RESOURCE STOCK ABUNDANCE IS BEING STUDIED. THE FITTED STRUCTURAL MODELS WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVED REGULATIONS GOVERNING NATURAL RESOURCE USE, AND PARTICULARLY COMMON POOL RESOURCES SUCH AS FISHERIES. SOIL CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION WORK, INCLUDING A 21ST CENTURY UPDATE OF THE NATIONAL COOPERATIVE SOIL SURVEY MAPS AND THEIR INTERPRETATIONS IN A MANNER THAT ALIGNS WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE AND QUANTITATIVE TECHNOLOGIES (GIS, MODELING, SOIL ANALYTICAL PROTOCOLS, SOIL PRODUCTIVE INDICES) IS AN ACTIVE RESEARCH AREA. THE PROJECT ADDRESSES THE VERY REAL AND PRESSING PROBLEM FACING IOWA LANDOWNERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHEREIN THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE MAPS DO NOT PROVIDE SPATIALLY EXPLICIT ASSESSMENTS OF SOIL PROPERTIES AND INTERPRETATIONS. THIS PROBLEM IS MAGNIFIED BY THE INCREASED STATE OF FLOODING, PONDING, EROSION AND OTHER INTEGRATED NATURAL/HUMAN MODIFIED SOIL-LAND ISSUES. SOIL FERTILITY RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED, SPECIFICALLY TO UNDERSTAND UNDERLYING PROCESSES THAT INFLUENCE SOIL ACIDIFICATION, CROP PHOSPHORUS AND POTASSIUM NEEDS AND UPTAKE, REMOVAL WITH HARVEST AND RECYCLING TO THE SOIL, AND TRANSPORT OFF FIELD, AS WELL AS EFFICIENT METHODS OF NUTRIENT OR AMENDMENTS APPLICATION. DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS SUCH AS SOIL TESTING AND PLANT ANALYSIS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ASSESS SOIL NUTRIENT LEVELS FOR CROPS TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE ECONOMICALLY OPTIMUM NUTRIENT OR AMENDMENTS APPLICATION RATES AND ALSO TO ASSESS THE RISK OF NUTRIENT LOSS TO WATER RESOURCES AS PART OF COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT TOOLS THAT CONSIDER OTHER FACTORS. THERE IS ACTIVE COLLABORATION AMONG EXTENSION SOIL FERTILITY EXTENSION FACULTY ACROSS THE MIDWEST REGION TO SHARE AND DISSEMINATE KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH FINDINGS. HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND WELL-BEING: A POOR DIET IS LINKED TO SEVERAL CHRONIC DISEASES INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, SOME TYPES OF CANCER, TYPE 2 DIABETES AND OBESITY. WORLDWIDE, IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT 11 MILLION PREMATURE DEATHS AND 255 MILLION DISABILITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A POOR DIET EACH YEAR. IN THE US, 14%, OR 650,000, OF PREMATURE DEATHS EACH YEAR ARE ATTRIBUTED TO A POOR DIET. REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY, SATURATED FAT, TRANS FAT, SODIUM AND ADDED SUGAR IN THE DIET WHILE INCREASING BENEFICIAL NUTRIENTS, SUCH AS FROM WHOLEGRAINS, FIBER, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, IS A KEY PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL. ISU RESEARCHERS ARE STUDYING WAYS TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH THROUGH INFORMING CONSUMERS ABOUT NUTRITION AND LIFESTYLE APPROACHES, AND DEVELOPMENT OF A FOOD SYSTEM THAT IS COST-EFFICIENT AND PROMOTES HEALTH THROUGH INTERACTION WITH FOOD COMPANIES AND COMMODITY GROUPS. THE WORK INCLUDES PROJECTS THAT INCREASE KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE FUNCTIONAL, SENSORY, ECONOMIC AND NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF FOODS AND HOW THEY CAN BE MANIPULATED TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH. TOOLS SUCH AS IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL REALITY ARE BEING USED TO INVESTIGATE HOW INDIVIDUALS MAKE FOOD CHOICES IN SETTINGS WHERE FOOD IS TYPICALLY PURCHASED, FOR EXAMPLE IN FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS. THROUGH THIS WORK, AND IN COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY PARTNERS, FOODS THAT ARE PROFITABLE AND IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH WILL BE DEVELOPED LEADING TO NEW FOOD PRODUCTS OR INGREDIENTS THAT WILL OPEN NEW MARKETS FOR ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION. MOREOVER, THE RESEARCH WILL IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF FOOD COMPANIES BY CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROCESSES THAT REDUCE COSTS. IN OTHER WORK, SCIENTISTS ARE CONDUCTING STUDIES TO IDENTIFY NEW TARGETS THAT COULD STRENGTHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THIS WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED WELL-BEING OF ANIMALS, PREVENT ZOONOTIC DISEASES THAT IMPACT HUMANS AND REDUCE THE CHANCES OF FUTURE ZOONOTIC DISEASE OUTBREAKS. BY IDENTIFYING NOVEL GENES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR OPTIMAL IMMUNE FUNCTION, THIS WORK WILL IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH, BUT ALSO ALLOW THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY TO GENETICALLY SELECT AGAINST ANIMALS CARRYING DEFECTS IN THESE ESSENTIAL GENES, THEREBY STRENGTHENING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF DOMESTICATED ANIMALS. HUMAN POTENTIAL AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: THE NATIONAL CHILDREN'S CENTER FOR RURAL AND AGRICULTURAL HEALTH AND SAFETY HAS SUGGESTED THAT HIGH QUALITY CHILD CARE THAT IS ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF AGRICULTURAL FAMILIES CAN BE A POWERFUL RECRUITING TOOL FOR AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO HIRE AND RETAIN ENOUGH EMPLOYEES. HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS THAT MEET YOUNG CHILDREN'S LEARNINGNEEDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BOOST THEIR PREPARATION FOR FORMAL SCHOOLING, BUT TO DO THIS FOR CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES, A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS, AND LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENTS OF YOUNG DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS (DLLS) IS NEEDED. ISU SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT TYPES OF LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE ARE RELATED TO IMPROVING SCHOOL READINESS IN THE EARLIEST STAGES. CURRENTLY, HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE GRADUATING 35,400 STUDENTS WITH DEGREES IN AGRICULTURE, BUT THIS WILL ONLY FILL 61% OF AGRICULTURE-RELATED JOBS. LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITIES MUST BE ABLE TO RECRUIT, SUPPORT, RETAIN, AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCE THIS CRITICAL WORKFORCE. PROJECTS TO ENHANCE THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF STUDENTS INTO AGRICULTURAL FIELDS ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE A SUSTAINABLE WORKFORCE. TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGY: AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY DEVELOPMENT HAS ENABLED HIGHER CROP PRODUCTION PRODUCTIVITY ALONGWITH HIGH AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT QUALITY, MAKING AVAILABLE A WIDE ARRAY OF AFFORDABLE, HEALTHY, AND NUTRITIOUS FOODS. MACHINE SYSTEMS ARE NOT JUST INTEGRATED MECHANICALLY OR PHYSICALLY INTO THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM, BUT ARE BECOMING INTERCONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER, AS WELL AS TO CROPPING SYSTEMS THROUGH SENSORS AND CONTROLLED ACTUATION OF IMPLEMENTS. ISU RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING MACHINE SYSTEMS TO SUSTAINABLY INTENSIFY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION TO MEET THE FOOD NEEDS IN THE LIGHT OF GROWING GLOBAL DEMAND. BEING ADDRESSED ARE STRATEGIES TO INCORPORATE MORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CROPPING SYSTEM INTO MACHINERY DESIGN AND OPERATION. THIS WORK IS CRITICALLY NEEDED TO DEVELOP MACHINERY SYSTEMS ENABLE GREATER PRODUCTION AND YIELD OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WITH GREATER INPUT EFFICIENCY. USING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE SOIL HEALTH IS A FOCUS FOR ISU RESEARCHERS. THE DAILY EROSION PROJECT USES REMOTELY SENSED AND ELECTRONICALLY AVAILABLE DATA, INCLUDING NEXRAD RADAR FOR RAINFALL, LIDAR FOR SOIL SLOPES, LANDSATFORFIELD MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND GSURGO FOR GEOREFERENCED SOILS, TO SUPPLY INPUTS TO THE WEPP SOIL EROSION AND WATER RUNOFF MODEL THAT ESTIMATES SOIL EROSION ON AGRICULTURAL HILL SLOPES ACROSS ALL OF IO WA AND PARTS OF MINNESOTA, WISCONSIN, NEBRASKA AND KANSAS. REAL TIME SOIL LOSS ESTIMATES WILL BE LINKED TO SOIL HEALTH SCIENCE TO ESTIMATE CHANGES IN SOIL HEALTH BASED ON SOIL EROSION PROCESSES. IN OTHER WORK, SOIL-CROP-MACHINE INTERACTIONS PARTICULARLY IN THE SOIL-TIRE AND SOIL-TOOL AREAS, AND INVESTIGATION INTO FACTORS AFFECTING SPRAY APPLICATION AND DRIFT, VEHICLE TESTING AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY ARE BEING STUDIED. LEADING EDGE ISSUES INCLUDE DISCRETE ELEMENT MODELING (DEM) OF SOIL AND CROP MATERIALS, COUPLING DEM WITH MULTI-BODY DYNAMIC MODELING, MODEL VALIDATION, AND REAL-TIME VIRTUAL TESTING. RESULTS FROM THESE STUDIES ARE DISSEMINATED DIRECTLY TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS THROUGH ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH STATE AND NATIONAL EXTENSION PROGRAMS. THIS WORK WILL IMPACT PRODUCTION COST REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS IMPROVED INPUT EFFICIENCY AND CROP SYSTEMS PRODUCTIVITY. OVERALL, THE RESEARCH WILL IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRARIAN AND INTENSIVELY MANAGED LANDSCAPES BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO BROADER SOCIETALLY RELEVANT OUTCOMES THAT INCLUDE INCREASED ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS OF THE U.S. AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISE AND DEVELOPMENT OF A DIVERSE AND GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE STEM WORKFORCE THROUGH STUDENT MENTORING.

IN THE 2023-2027 PERIOD, THE STATION EXPECTS TO SUPPORT BETWEEN 44 AND 50 RESEARCH PROJECTS ACROSS FIVE CRITICAL ISSUES-AGRICULTURE; CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINING NATURAL RESOURCES; FOOD SAFETY; NUTRITION, HEALTH, AND WELLNESS; AND RURAL COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT-AS WELL AS PROJECTS WITHIN THE MCINTIRE-STENNIS FORESTRY SCIENCE AREAS.  WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE AREA, RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES, PROCESSES AND DELIVERS FOOD, FIBER, AND MYRIAD ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON BIOTECHNOLOGICAL AND MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN CROP AND DAIRY PRODUCTION TO MINIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKET RISKS AND CAPTURING NEW MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES. RESEARCH HERE IS EXPECTED TO GROW WITH THE RECENT HIRING OF A CROP BREEDER FACULTY. FOCUS WILL ALSO BE PLACED ON HELPING THE STATE AND REGION CONTINUE TOEXPAND ITS SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY TO BENEFIT THE BLUE ECONOMY.  WORK WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO TARGET ISSUES RELATED TO MITIGATING AND ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE AS A SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THROUGH BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCE, AN EMERGING AREA OF EXCELLENCE IS IN SOIL MICROBIOLOGY, AND THESE EFFORTS WILL BE ONE OF THE CORE OF THE NHAES RESEARCH MISSION IN CLIMATE SCIENCE. A SECOND CORE AREA IS IN WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WATER AND AGRICULTURAL LAND AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.  FOOD SAFETY IS AN AREA IN WHICH LESS RESEARCH IS EXPECTED THAN IN THE PAST. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH THAT WILL CONTINUE WILL FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE GROWING AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO MANAGING PATHOGENS IN SHELLFISH. DIFFERENTIATING STRAINS OF PATHOGENS AND PREDICTING NEW STRAINS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT THE NORTHEAST AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY MAINTAINS ITS HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS. RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO GROW IN THE NUTRITION AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS AREAS, AS EARLY-CAREER FACULTY TRANSITION INTO BEING MORE EXPERIENCED SCIENTISTS AND NEW FACULTY ARE ONBOARDED. THE FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE ON IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENSURING NUTRITIONAL BALANCE AND HEALTH OF UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS IN NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND. THIS INCLUDES REFUGEE, IMMIGRANT, AND LATINX POPULATIONS, WHICH HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW IN SIZE IN THE REGION. CONSIDERATIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THESE POPULATIONS' EATING HABITS, MICROBIOME COMPOSITIONS, AND NUTRITIONAL BEHAVIORS WILL HELP INFORM SCIENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS.  LASTLY, AS NEW HAMPSHIRE'S COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE DEMOGRAPHICALLY AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY, NHAES RESEARCH WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS PART OF ITS RESEARCH PORTFOLIO ON CHARACTERIZING THOSE TRENDS, THE IMPACTS OF THOSE TRENDS, AND HOW LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS CAN BE BEST DEVELOPED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND SUPPORT THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE AND REGION. USING SCIENCE-BASED, DATA-DRIVEN METHODS TO IDENTIFY KEY FACTORS STRESSING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDING RESEARCH-INFORMED RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE INDIVIDUAL, FIRM, MUNICIPALITY, AND STATE LEVELS ARE CRUCIAL FOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY.

OUR PLAN OF WORK FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING SIX CRITICAL ISSUES IN THE STATE: (1) SUSTAINABLE DRYLAND AGRICULTURE, (2) NATURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES, (3) HORTICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS, (4) HEALTH, NUTRITION AND FOOD SAFETY, AND (5) COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ADDRESSING THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES PUT FORTH BY NEVADAS STAKEHOLDERS.  GROWING A STRONG AGRICULTURE ECONOMY IN THE DRIEST STATE REQUIRES RESEARCH ADDRESSING TOPICS SUCH AS PEST MANAGEMENT, EFFICIENT IRRI GATION, SUSTAINABLE RANGE MANAGEMENT, RISK MANAGEMENTFOR PRODUCERS AND ALTERNATIVE CROPS FOR HIGHDESERT AREAS.  FOR NAES, EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO IDENTIFY CROPS AND ANIMAL BREEDS BEST ADAPTED TO PRODUCTION IN THESE HOT AND DRY CONDITIONS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CROP VARIETIES AND ANIMAL BREEDS BETTER SUITED TO TOLERATE AND THRIVE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. THE STATION WILL ALSO STUDY PLANT AND ANIMAL PRODUCTION PRACTICES TO INCREASE YIELDS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.  THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT IMPACT NEVADAS NATURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED, INCLUDING DROUGHT, FLOODS, WATERSHED AND RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT, WILDFIRES, INVASIVE SPECIES, AND CONSERVATION OF SAGE GROUSE AND OTHER WILDLIFE HABITATS. PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS CRITICAL TO THE ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL WELLBEING OF THE STATE.  COMPETING INTERESTS PRESENT CHALLENGES TO MAINTAINING A HEALTHY BALANCE PARTICULARLY WHEN LIMITED RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. WATER PRESENTS AN IMPORTANT BUT LIMITED RESOURCE IN NEVADA AND THE GREAT BASIN IN GENERAL. FOR THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION, RESEARCHERS WILL CONDUCT STUDIES TO MONITOR BOTH WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ADDITIONAL STUDIES TO ACCESS WATER USAGE, STORAGE, AS WELL AS WATER RECLAMATION, WILL BE SUPPORTED.  NEVADAS RANGELANDS AND FOREST/WOODLANDS ARE ALSO HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO WILDFIRES THAT CAN DESTROY MILLIONS OF ACRES PER YEAR. RESEARCHERS WILL CONDUCT STUDIES TO DEVELOP MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO PROTECT THESE NATURAL RESOURCES FROM THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THESE MEGAFIRES. THEY WILL ALSO LOOK TO DEVELOP WAYS TO BETTER DETECT THESE FIRES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MORE RAPID RESPONSE AND MINIMIZE THEIR SPREAD.  MANAGEMENT OF THE RANGELANDS AND FOREST/WOODLANDS ARE CRITICAL TO NEVADA. RANGELAND HEALTH IS UNDER ATTACK BY COMPETITION BETWEEN LI VESTOCK PRODUCTION, WILDLIFE AND FERAL HORSES/BURROS. STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS ISSUES AND TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO SUPPORT A HEALTHY BALANCE.  NEVADA GREENINDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS, GROWERS AND FOOD PRODUCERS OFTEN CONTEND WITH DROUGHT, PESTS AND WATER USE ISSUES, AND THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, RENO WILL HELP PROVIDE THEM WITH THE LATEST RESEARCHBASED INFORMATION TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES.  FOR THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION, FUNDING WILL SUPPORT STUDIES TO IMPROVE THE GROWING, HARVESTING, PACKAGING, TRANSPORTING, AND MARKETING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES GROWN IN NEVADA.

FOOD SYSTEMS, NUTRITION, HEALTH, AND WELLBEING HEART DISEASE, CANCER, STROKE, AND DIABETES ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOP LEADING SEVEN CAUSES OF DEATH IN SOUTH DAKOTA AND STRESSRELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE ON THE RISE. LIVING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE GREATLY REDUCES A PERSONS RISK FOR DEVELOPING CHRONIC DISEASE. LOCAL GARDENS, HIGHTUNNELS, AND GREENHOUSE FACILITIES HELP INCREASE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION IN THE STATE. AQUAPONICS, A SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION METHOD THAT COMBINES ADVANCED AQUACULTURE WITH HYDROPONICS, IS ON THE RISE IN SD TO MEET THE NEED FOR MORE FRESH PRODUCE. NATURAL FERMENTATION PROCESSES REPLACE CHEMICAL ADDITIVES FOR EXTENDING SHELFLIFE OF FOODS AND BEVERAGES. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE DIETARY AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES CAN REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF CHRONIC DISEASE ACROSS THE STATES POPULATION.  NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 19 MILLION ACRES OF CROPLAND AND 23 MILLION ACRES OF PERMANENT PASTURE AND RANGELAND IN SOUTH DAKOTA. RANGELAND IS THE LIFELINE OF STREAMS, PONDS, AND LAKES, AND IT IS A SOURCE OF WILDLIFE HABITAT, RECREATION, AND SCENIC BEAUTY. AS AN AGRICULTURAL RESOURCE, CROPLAND HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC, AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL WELLBEING OF THE STATE.

FOOD PRODUCTION, FOOD QUALITY) AND SERVICES (CLEAN AIR AND WATER) THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON THEM. WESEEK TO INITIATE CUTTING EDGE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE, ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND RESTORATION, SOIL HEALTH, WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY, ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY, HABITAT EVALUATION, NATURE-BASED RECREATION, VALUING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, GREEN TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPES, ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS AMONG OTHERS.  HEALTH <(>&<)> HEALTHY FUTURES: LIFE ON PLANET EARTH DEPENDS ON LIFE SUPPORTING GOODS AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COUPLED SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OR ECOSYSTEMS. THE HEALTH OF EARTH'S ECOSYSTEMS HAS DETERIORATED SO MUCH THAT THE PUBLIC IS CONCERNED ABOUT A LOSS OF LIFE SUPPORT FOR ALL ORGANISMS, INCLUDING THE HUMAN COMMUNITY. ECOSYSTEM HEALTH, AS AN INTEGRATIVE CONCEPT, INCLUDES BOTH THE BIOPHYSICAL AND SOCIOECOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS. THE BIOPHYSICAL REALM INCLUDES CLIMATE, AIR, THE ENVIRONMENT, WATER, ENERGY, WILDLIFE, FOOD, SOIL HEALTH AMONG OTHERS. THE SOCIOECONOMIC ASPECTS INCLUDE ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY, SOCIAL SERVICES, RECREATION AND HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH AND WELFARE. THE LATTER IS PARTICULARLY AT RISK IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD NOT ONLY FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION BUT ALSO FROM INCREASING STRESS AND EMERGING PATHOGENS AND DISEASES. WE SEEK TO REVITALIZE AND EXPAND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND ANIMAL, AND HUMAN HEALTH RELATED PROGRAMS, STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND STAKEHOLDERS, AND PROVIDE A TRANSLATIONAL PLATFORM WITH FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, ANIMAL AND HUMAN WELFARE AND HEALTH, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY REFORMS.

THE SEVEN CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WE WILL ADDRESS ARE: (1) GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND HUNGER; (2) CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES; (3) NUTRITION AND HEALTH; (4) FOOD SAFETY; (5) HEALTHY, FINANCIALLY SECURE FAMILIES; (6) YOUTH DEVELOPMENT; AND (7) COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. THESE SEVEN CRITICAL ISSUES ALIGN WELL WITH NIFA'S FIRST FIVE STRATEGIC GOALS: (1) COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE TO SUPPORT AMERICA'S WORKING LANDS, NATURAL RESOURCES AND COMMUNITIES; (2) ENSURE AMERICA'S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM IS EQUITABLE, RESILIENT, AND PROSPEROUS; (3) FOSTER AN EQUITABLE AND COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE FOR ALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS; (4) PROVIDE ALL AMERICANS SAFE, NUTRITIOUS FOOD;AND (5) EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN RURAL AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES.  THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED WITH THESE FUNDS WILL RESULT IN DELIVERABLES THAT INCLUDE PRESENTATIONS AT SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS, SCIENTIFIC AND LAY PUBLICATIONS, OUTREACH ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EXTENSION EVENTS AND FACT SHEETS, AND TOOLS OR DEVICES DESIGNED TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC NEEDS. IMPACTS FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE CHANGES IN KNOWLEDGE, CHANGES IN ACTIONS, AND CHANGES IN CONDITIONS. THIS RESEARCH WILL BENEFIT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS AND THE BROADER AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY; FOOD PROCESSORS; THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF UTAH, THE WESTERN UNITED STATES, THE COUNTRY, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY; STATE AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES; AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.  DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SEVEN CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WE WILL ADDRESS ARE PROVIDED BELOW:  GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND HUNGER THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS GOAL IS TO ENHANCE GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY THROUGH PRODUCTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS. THIS IS NOT MEANT AS AN ABANDONMENT OF PAST AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES OR AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS. IT REQUIRES AN EXPANDED VIEW OF AGRICULTURE, NOT AN ABANDONMENT OF AGRICULTURE. WE CAN MAKE REAL PROGRESS IN IMPROVING THE STANDARD OF LIVING, NOT ONLY IN THE U.S., BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TO FEED GROWING POPULATIONS, WE MUST DEVELOP MORE STRESS-RESISTANT CROPS AND ENSURE AN IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY OF LIVESTOCK. SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES THAT RESULT IN HEAT, DROUGHT, AND SALINE-RESISTANT PLANTS WILL ALLOW FARMERS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN WORLD MARKETS, WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO FARM PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS WILL INCLUDE TRADITIONAL CROP AND LIVESTOCK BREEDING BUT WILL ALSO EMPHASIZE GENOMICS. CROPS WILL BE PRODUCED WHICH RELY LESS ON MAN-MADE INPUTS LIKE FERTILIZER AND FUELS, AND MORE ON GENE MANIPULATION. HOWEVER, IT WILL REQUIRE MORE THAN LABORATORY WORK AS THESE IMPROVED PLANTS MUST BE FIELD -TESTED, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. MORE FOCUS WILL NEED TO BE GIVEN TO THE \"SCIENCE\" OF AGRICULTURE. ANIMALS MUST BE MADE MORE EFFICIENT IN THE USE OF EXISTING OR EVEN ALTERED FORAGE RESOURCES.  CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES RANGELAND, FORESTS, AND AGRICULTURE ARE ALL CLIMATE DEPENDENT. CONSEQUENTLY, ANY CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE WILL REQUIRE THAT PLANTS AND ANIMALS ADAPT TO OR MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. AGRICULTURE THE MANAGEMENT OF RANGELAND AND FORESTS MUST BE AT THE FOREFRONT IN ADAPTING TO NEW CLIMATE REALITIES, AS WELL AS MITIGATING MANY OF THE INFLUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE CONCEPT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT NEW TO UTAH PRODUCERS. UTAHAN'S HAVE ADJUSTED TO CHANGES IN WATER AND TEMPERATURE FOR MANY YEARS. YET, THERE IS MORE THAT CAN BE DONE TO ENHANCE THE PRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENT OF BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS. ANIMALS CAN BECOME MORE EFFICIENT IN THE CONSUMPTION OF FORAGES THROUGH APPROPRIATE BREEDING PRACTICES AND TAILORING LIVESTOCK TO MEET FORAGE CONDITIONS. WHILE THERE IS GREAT VIGOR IN MANY BREEDS, SOME ARE CLEARLY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE SPARSELY VEGETATIVE STATE OF MUCH OF UTAH'S LAND. EFFICIENCIES CAN BE IMPROVED THROUGH GENETIC MODIFICATIONS AS WELL. PLANTS CAN BE MADE MORE RESISTANT TO DROUGHT AND SALINITY THROUGH TRADITIONAL BREEDING PRACTICES, AND THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF GENOMICS. WATER WILL BECOME AN EVEN MORE CRITICAL PART OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PROCESSES AS IT BECOMES LESS AVAILABLE AND/OR THE QUALITY BECOMES LESS SUITABLE FOR AGRICULTURE. THE IDEA OF WATER DEPENDENCY UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE CANNOT BE OVER EMPHASIZED AS POPULATIONS INCREASE, AND WATER SHIFTS FROM AGRICULTURAL TO MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL USES. PUBLIC/PRIVATE LAND INTERFACE IS ANOTHER AREA REQUIRING EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND OUTREACH. SIXTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL LAND AVAILABLE IN THE WEST IS PUBLIC LAND, OWNED BY EITHER THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS PRESENTS UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO THE WEST THAT MOST OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CANNOT BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND.  NUTRITION AND HEALTH ITSEEMS STRANGE TO SPEAK OF NUTRITION IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS SUCH A REMARKABLE FOOD SYSTEM, BUT NUTRITION IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY--BUT IT IS A PROBLEM OF BOTH SCARCITY AND PLENTY. THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, SUCH AS YOUNG CHILDREN AND AGING ADULTS, ARE SUBJECT TO FOOD SCARCITY. OUR COMMON GOAL SHOULD BE TO ALLOW OUR CHILDREN TO LIVE HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. HENCE, ADEQUATE NUTRITION BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR THOSE BOTH AFFLUENT AND THOSE IN POVERTY WITHIN THE U.S. AND OTHERS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THAT DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT TO AVOID DISEASE AND MALNUTRITION. BECAUSE THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN MOVING AGRICULTURE AND FOOD TECHNOLOGIES FORWARD, THEY SHOULD ALSO BE THE MEANS TO MAKE THE FOOD SELECTIONS MORE NUTRITIOUS. IN ADDITION TO CHANGING THE NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF FOOD, EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS TO TEACH PEOPLE THE CONSEQUENCES OF OBESITY MUST BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE.  FOOD SAFETY FOOD SAFETY IS A NECESSARY AREA OF EMPHASIS AS FOOD AND FIBER PATHOGENS INCREASINGLY COST THE U.S. ECONOMY SIGNIFICANT LOST TIME AND INCREASED HEALTH EXPENDITURES. NEW DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO RAPIDLY TEST FOOD PRODUCTS FOR PATHOGENS. BUT EVEN MORE BASIC IS THE NEED TO PROVIDE A SAFE SYSTEM THROUGH WHICH FOOD CAN BE TRANSFERRED. SOME OF THAT WILL INVOLVE BETTER IDENTIFICATION OF FOOD AND FIBER FLOWS WITHIN THE U.S. AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  TRACEABILITY WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BUT NEW, LESS COSTLY METHODS OF FOOD CHAIN IDENTIFICATION MUST BE DEVELOPED. PATHOGENS CAN ENTER THE FOOD SUPPLY AT ANY POINT DURING THE PRODUCTION, HARVEST, PROCESSING, AND TRANSPORTING PROCESS. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE U.S. CONSUMER NOT HAVE TO QUESTION IF THEIR FOOD IS SAFE. GREAT STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE IN PROTECTING THE FOOD SYSTEM, BUT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND OUTREACH ARE REQUIRED. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE SAFETY OF THEIR FOOD SUPPLY, WHICH SOMETIMES IS A DIFFICULT TASK GIVEN THE EXTENSIVE PROCESSING THAT OCCU RS. IT MUST ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED THAT AMERICA HAS THE SAFEST FOOD SUPPLY THE WORLD. FOOD SAFETY IN THE HOME IS ALSO IMPORTANT AND IS INCLUDED IN THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. AREAS OF CONCERN INCLUDE PROPER PREPARATION, STORAGE, AND PRESERVATION OF FOOD, INCLUDING PROPER P ROCEDURES FOR CANNING FOODS.  HEALTHY, FINANCIALLY SECURE FAMILIES UTAH IS IN THE TOP 5 OF THE U.S. STATES WITH BANKRUPTCY AND MUCH MORE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION NEED TO BE DONE TO FREE THE STATE'S CONSUMERS FROM THIS TRAP. BECAUSE OF UTAH'S TYPICALLY LARGER FAMILY SIZE, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME AVAILABLE FOR BASIC FAMILY NEEDS SLIPS BELOW THE MEAN FOR THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. UTAH FAMILIES ALREADY FACE HIGH DEBT LOADS LEADING TO BANKRUPTCY, LOW SAVINGS, AND THE LACK OF LIQUID ASSETS. HENCE, A PRIORITY OF THIS PLANNED PROGRAM IS TO ENHANCE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. OTHER ASPECTS OF FAMILY HEALTH THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE HEALTHY MARITAL AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING,DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT HEALTHY EATING HABITS.  YOUTH DEVELOPMENT YOUTH ISSUES ARE PARAMOUNT IN A STATE WITH HIGHER-THAN-AVERAGE BIRTH RATES. AS THE NUMBER OF YOUTH GROWS, MORE RESEARCH ON EDUCATION IS NEEDED IN IDENTIFYING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE GROWTH AND MATURATION. A SIGNIFICANT PRIORITY OF THIS CRITICAL ISSUE IS TO DISCOVER IMPROVED METHODS FOR ENCOURAGING POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT.  COMMUNITY RESILIENCE THE EXISTING CONFLICTS BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LANDOWNERS AND URBAN-RURAL PRESSURES ARE LIKELY TO BE EXACERBATED OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS AS ALTERNATIVE USES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDS INCREASE AND URBAN ENCROACHMENT CONTINUES TO EXTEND INTO RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE AND REGION, RESULTING IN A DECLINE OF AVAILABLE OPEN-SPACE. THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF MANY RURAL AREAS IS ALSO IN JEOPARDY. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH BUSINESS RETENTION AND EXPANSION ACTIVITIES NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION, COMMUNITY RESILIENCE DEPENDS ON SOUND COMMUNITY PLANNING, AND INVESTMENT IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EDUCATION, CHILDCARE, YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, RECREATION, HEALTH CARE, AND FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d345a8ea-b0ac-7e5d-b949-6507917f2140-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23HFPXXXXXG002_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736072, "Award ID": "NI23HFPXXXXXG001", "Award Amount": 513313.1, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-21", "CFDA Number": "10.203", "Description": "AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY, FEDERAL CAPACITY FUNDS ARE ADMINISTERED STRATEGICALLY TO ADDRESS A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES IN NEW YORK STATE AND BEYOND AND FOSTER THE INTEGRATION OF APPLIED RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMMING.
