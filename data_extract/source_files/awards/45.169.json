ELECTRONIC DICTIONARIES. [THE PROJECT SUPPORTS THE CREATION AND DISSEMINATION OF DIGITAL DICTIONARIES FOR LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGES. WITH MANY WORLD LANGUAGES AT RISK OF EXTINCTION, ONLINE DICTIONARIES & GLOSSARIES ARE INCREASINGLY CRUCIAL. UNFORTUNATELY, THE LANGUAGES MOST IN NEED OF SUCH RESOURCES HAVE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. THE AVAILABILITY OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A LANGUAGE IS PROPORTIONAL TO ITS REPRESENTATION - THE MORE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE IN DIGITAL FORMAT, THE EASIER IT BECOMES TO AUTOMATICALLY PROCESS IT. CONVERSELY, THE LESS A LANGUAGE/CULTURE IS REPRESENTED ONLINE, THE HIGHER THE COSTS OF RETRIEVING AND PROCESSING DATA ABOUT IT. WE PROPOSE TO PROTOTYPE A DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN HELP REDRESS THIS INEQUALITY BY DRASTICALLY REDUCING THE COSTS/TECHNICAL EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO CREATE, PUBLISH AND MAINTAIN ONLINE DICTIONARIES.
