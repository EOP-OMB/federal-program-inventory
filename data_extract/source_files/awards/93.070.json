AS WELL AS INVOLVEMENT OF STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND OTHER EXPERTS IN RADIATION PROTECTION. THE RADIATION PROTECTION ISSUES IDENTIFIED WILL BE ADDRESSED BY THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, EVALUATION AND DISSEMINATION OF PRACTICE-AND EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES AND TOOLS, INCLUDING GUIDANCE, OUTREACH, WORKSHOPS, TOOLS, AND TRAINING THAT CAN LEAD TO ACCOMPLISHING THIS GOAL. THE CONFERENCE OF RADIATION CONTROL PROGRAM DIRECTORS (CRCPD), A NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION WHOSE MEMBERSHIP IS MADE UP PRIMARILY OF THE DIRECTORS AND RADIATION PROFESSIONAL STAFF OF STATE AND LOCAL RADIATION CONTROL PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, WILL USE MULTI-FACETED METHODS IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES, INCLUDING ENGAGING MULTI-ORGANIZATIONAL WORKING GROUPS, THUS ENHANCING THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER RADIATION PROTECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS; DEVELOPING AND DISSEMINATING TECHNICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE GUIDANCE; AND SHARING INFORMATION THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AT CONFERENCES, TRAINING, AND WORKSHOPS ON RADIATION PROTECTION ISSUES.

OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS, FL BRACE HAS IMPLEMENTED THE BRACE FRAMEWORK, WHICH HAS IMPROVED THE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR TO RESPOND TO CLIMATE-RELATED EVENTS. THIS WORK INCLUDED THE CREATION OF A SERIES OF STATE-LEVEL CLIMATE AND HEALTH PROFILE REPORTS, WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO CONDUCT A VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR SIX CLIMATE IMPACTS, AND ASSESSING CLIMATE-SPECIFIC PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. IN CONSULTATION WITH THE FDOH, FSU WILL CONTINUE LEADING ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES.  PAST PROGRAM ACTIVITIES LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE ON HUMAN HEALTH IN FLORIDA. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NECESSARY TO ALLOW THE FL BRACE PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTING EVIDENCE-BASED PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS AND ADAPTATION PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND EVALUATING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS TO ENSURE THEY ARE MEETING INTENDED OUTCOMES AND TO INFORM FUTURE ADAPTATION APPROACHES. BENEFITS INCLUDE DEVELOPING INTERVENTIONS AND ADAPTATIONS SPECIFIC TO FLORIDA\u2019S UNIQUE DEMOGRAPHICS AND CLIMATE HAZARDS, INCORPORATING CLIMATE SCIENCE INTO ROUTINE STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES BY EDUCATION AND INCREASED CAPACITY, AND WORKING WITH STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF CLIMATE HAZARDS.  BUILDING ON THE WORK COMPLETED DURING THE LAST ROUND OF FUNDING, FL BRACE WILL NOW FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTING PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS AND ADAPTATION PROJECTS WITH THE GOAL OF ENHANCING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE-RELATED EVENTS. BY IMPLEMENTING THE BRACE FRAMEWORK, OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE-RELATED EVENTS ON THE HEALTH OF FLORIDIANS HAS INCREASED. THIS KNOWLEDGE HAS ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHICH WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM TARGETED ADAPTATION STRATEGIES. CONTINUED SUPPORT FROM OUR ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF EXPERTS AND EXPANSION TO INCLUDE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FROM VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WILL ENSURE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INTERVENTIONS AND INCREASED CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

WE WILL CREATE THE CLIMATE IMPACT COMPENDIUM WITH AT LEAST TWO SECTIONS (I. EXTREME HEAT; II. TROPICAL STORMS AND HURRICANES) BY OBTAINING THE LATEST, MOST RELEVANT DATA AND ANALYZING SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS. THE FL BRACE PROGRAM WILL DESIGN ADAPTATION ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING CLIMATE-RELATED THREATS TO HEALTH: 1) HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXTREME HEAT EXPOSURE, INCLUDING EVENTS SUCH AS HEAT WAVES, AND 2) HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXTREME EVENTS, SUCH AS TROPICAL STORMS AND HURRICANES.

PRIORITY AREAS FOR PUERTO RICO ARE HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, INCLUDING HURRICANES, FLOODS, AND DROUGHTS. COMPREHENSIVE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES THAT ADDRESS THE FACILITATION OF COMMUNITY ACCESS TO RESOURCES WILL FOCUS ON CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR THE CHRONICALLY ILL AND THE ELDERLY TO PROVIDE IMPROVED ACCESS TO RESOURCES FOR EMERGENCY PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE.

THE PROGRAM WILL BUILD AND USE STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY & EXPERTISE IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SURVEILLANCE; CREATE MODERN, INTEROPERABLE, AND REAL-TIME PUBLIC HEALTH DATA AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS; MODERNIZE THE COLLECTION, INTEGRATION, DISSEMINATION, & APPLICATION OF TIMELY, LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DATA; AND EMPOWER PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS, POLICY MEMBERS, AND OTHERS TO MAKE INFORMATION-DRIVEN DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEIR HEALTH. THE EPHT PROGRAM STRATEGY WILL SERVE AS A FRAMEWORK AND GUIDING LINE FOR INTEGRATING AND COORDINATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN NEBRASKA.  THE NE EPHT WILL ACHIEVE THIS GOAL BY ASSESSING EXISTING PROGRAMS AND ASSOCIATED CAPACITIES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PRACTICE, AND ENHANCING THOSE, OR CREATING NEW ACTIVITIES IN AREAS SUCH AS SURVEILLANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, PARTNERSHIPS, OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION, PROGRAM CAPACITY, AND PROGRAM EVALUATION/PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT.
