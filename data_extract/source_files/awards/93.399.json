INTERPLAY AMONG TISSUE MICROENVIRONMENT, CLONAL ARCHITECTURE, AND GUT MICROBIOME - SUMMARY COLORECTAL CANCER (CRC) AFFECTS ~145,000 PEOPLE/YEAR IN THE US AND IS THE 3RD MOST COMMON CAUSE OF CANCER RELATED DEATHS. CRC ARISES FROM EARLY LESIONS THAT ARE PRE-CANCEROUS; THESE EARLY LESIONS ARE COLON ADENOMAS AND SERRATED SESSILE LESIONS (SSL). COLON ADENOMAS ACCOUNT FOR 80-85% OF THE CRC PRECANCEROUS LESIONS AND PROGRESS TO CRC VIA AN EARLY ADENOMAAADVANCED ADENOMAACRC SEQUENCE. IN LIGHT OF THE WELL CHARACTERIZED CLINICAL NATURAL HISTORY OF ADENOMAS, WE PLAN TO STUDY THEM AS EARLY LESIONS AND TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE FORMATION AND PROGRESSION OF EARLY PRECANCEROUS LESIONS. NOTABLY, ONLY A FEW EARLY ADENOMAS WILL PROGRESS TO ADVANCED ADENOMAS (AA) AND EVEN FEWER WILL PROGRESS TO CRC. OUR GROUP AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT MUTATIONS ALONE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE ADENOMA INITIATION AND/OR PROGRESSION IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES. THERE ARE LIKELY MULTIPLE ADENOMA NONAUTONOMOUS MECHANISMS THAT COOPERATE WITH THE DNA ALTERATIONS IN THE ADENOMAS TO CAUSE PROGRESSION, AND THESE MECHANISMS ARE LIKELY OPERATIVE IN DISCRETE SUBSETS OF AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS. WE AND OTHERS HAVE OBSERVED ALTERATIONS, SUCH AS TISSUE SENESCENCE, HIGH CANCER DRIVER GENE MUTATION LOADS, ABERRANT DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS, AND DYSBIOTIC GUT MICROBIOMES, IN THE NORMAL COLON OF PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED ADENOMAS AND CRC PATIENTS. WE HAVE TERMED NORMAL COLONS WITH THESE FEATURES \u201cPRIMED COLONS\u201d AND PROPOSE THAT THESE FEATURES ARE PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS THAT AFFECT ADENOMA INITIATION AND PROGRESSION. BASED ON THESE OBSERVATIONS AND OUR PRIOR STUDIES, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT EARLY LESION PROGRESSION REQUIRES A SUITE OF HALLMARK BEHAVIORS AND THAT THESE BEHAVIORS ARE INDUCED BY ADENOMA AUTONOMOUS FACTORS (E.G. CANCER DRIVER GENE MUTATIONS) AND ADENOMA NONAUTONOMOUS FACTORS FROM THE \u201cPRIMED COLON\u201d OR ADENOMA MICROENVIRONMENT.  OUR PROPOSED STUDIES WILL INTEGRATE BASIC AND TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH PROJECTS TO ITERATIVELY EXAMINE THE DIRECT CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERACTIONS OF ADENOMAS, THE COLON \u201cPRIMED\u201d MICROENVIRONMENT, AND HOST- SYSTEMIC FACTORS AS \u201cCO-ORGANIZERS\u201d OF ADENOMA INITIATION AND/OR PROGRESSION.

FOR MANY HEREDITARY CANCER SYNDROMES, THE LIFE-TIME RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER APPROACHES 100%. DESPITE REVOLUTIONARY ADVANCES IN \u201cOMICS\u201d TECHNOLOGIES, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR ALTERATIONS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRECANCEROUS LESIONS AND PROMOTE EARLY TUMOR DEVELOPMENT REMAINS VERY LIMITED, THUS HINDERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFICACIOUS INTERVENTIONS. A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF ACCOMPLISHED INVESTIGATORS AT FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER (FCCC), WITH COMBINED EXPERTISE IN CANCER PREVENTION, HERITABLE CANCER RISK, CANCER BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR MODELING, AND DRUG DISCOVERY HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED TO ADDRESS THIS UNMET IN AN UNPRECEDENTED WAY. THE GOAL OF THE FCCC CAP-IT CENTER IS TO EFFECTIVELY COORDINATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFICACIOUS MOLECULARLY-TARGETED AGENTS FOR PRECISION CANCER PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERCEPTION IN POPULATIONS AT HIGH RISK FOR CANCER. ALL STUDIES ARE FACILITATED BY THE UNIQUE RESOURCES OF THE FCCC RISK ASSESSMENT PROGRAM, WHICH INCLUDES OVER 12,000 FAMILIES AT HIGH RISK FOR CANCER AND 2000 CONFIRMED GERMLINE MUTATION CARRIERS. A COMPREHENSIVE PIPELINE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGENTS FOR CANCER PREVENTION AND INTERCEPTION IS PROPOSED THAT CONSISTS OF THREE WELL-DEVELOPED RESEARCH DOMAINS: TARGET VALIDATION (AIM 1), AGENT IDENTIFICATION AND SCREENING (AIM 2), AND PILOT IN VIVO EFFICACY STUDIES (AIM 3). EACH DOMAIN WILL BE LED BY A FCCC INVESTIGATOR, WHO IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN THE RESPECTIVE FIELD. TWO HIGHLY INNOVATIVE PROJECTS ARE PROPOSED THAT ILLUSTRATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE CAP-IT FRAMEWORK. PROJECT 1 (ENTERING AT TARGET VALIDATION) FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEWLY-IDENTIFIED AGENT THAT REFOLDS MUTANT P53. ITS ABILITY TO TARGET THE TP53 MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH LI- FRAUMENI SYNDROME AND INHIBIT PRECANCEROUS LESIONS IN A SETTING OF MUTANT P53 WILL BE EVALUATED. PROJECT 2 (ENTERING AT AGENT IDENTIFICATION AND SCREENING) UNIQUELY TARGETS THE INITIATED PANCREATIC STROMA AS A STRATEGY FOR EARLY INTERCEPTION IN THE FORMATION OF PANCREATIC CANCER. A NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY AGAINST THE STROMAL PROTEIN NETRIN G1, THAT CAN REVERT FIBROBLASTS TO A TUMOR-SUPPRESSIVE PHENOTYPE, HAS BEEN DISCOVERED. ANTIBODIES WITH IMPROVED POTENCY WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND TESTED IN VIVO FOR THEIR ABILITY TO INTERCEPT THE PROGRESSION OF PANCREATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA. ALL CAP-IT RESEARCH AND TRAINING WILL BE STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY THE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND COORDINATING ACTIVITIES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, LED BY DR. CLAPPER. EXPERTISE IN BIOSTATISTICS, BIOINFORMATICS, AND DATA MANAGEMENT WILL BE PROVIDED TO CAP-IT INVESTIGATORS BY AN INFORMATICS CORE, LED BY DR. ROSS. COLLABORATIONS AMONG THE NCI, FCCC AND OTHER CAP-IT CENTERS, AS WELL AS THE SHARING OF DATA AND RESOURCES THROUGH THE DATA AND RESOURCE COORDINATION CENTER, WILL FOSTER PRODUCTIVITY AND INTEGRATION ACROSS THE CAP-IT NETWORK (AIM 4). THE LONG LEGACY OF FCCC IN CLINICAL RISK ASSESSMENT AND PRECLINICAL PREVENTIVE AGENT DEVELOPMENT, WHEN COMBINED WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERTISE IN DRUG DESIGN AND CANCER BIOLOGY, MAKES THIS CENTER UNIQUELY

NEURODEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES ARE SHAPED BY DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GENES AND ENVIRONMENTS. MALADAPTIVE EXPERIENCES EARLY IN LIFE CAN ALTER DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES, LEADING TO HARMFUL AND ENDURING DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUELAE. PRE- AND POSTNATAL HAZARDS INCLUDE MATERNAL SUBSTANCE EXPOSURE, TOXICANT EXPOSURES IN PREGNANCY AND EARLY LIFE, MATERNAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, PARENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, MALTREATMENT, STRUCTURAL RACISM, AND EXCESSIVE STRESS. TO ELUCIDATE HOW VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS IMPACT CHILD DEVELOPMENT, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT A NORMATIVE TEMPLATE OF DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OVER THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF LIFE BE ESTABLISHED BASED ON A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE SAMPLE OF THE US POPULATION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE HEALTHY BRAIN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL CONSORTIUM (HBCD-NC) HAS BEEN FORMED TO DEPLOY A HARMONIZED, OPTIMIZED, AND INNOVATIVE SET OF NEUROIMAGING (MRI, EEG) MEASURES COMPLEMENTED BY AN EXTENSIVE BATTERY OF BEHAVIORAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOLS, AND BIOSPECIMENS TO UNDERSTAND NEURODEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES IN A SAMPLE OF 7,500 MOTHERS AND INFANTS ENROLLED AT 24 SITES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES (US).

ABSTRACT THE PROPOSED RESEARCH CENTER FOR SCALABLE TELEHEALTH CANCER CARE (STELLAR) IS GROUNDED IN THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE (IOM) VISION THAT QUALITY CANCER CARE INCLUDES NOT ONLY TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE, BUT ALSO PROMOTION OF THE PATIENT\u2019S LONG-TERM HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. CANCER RISK BEHAVIORS (E.G., SMOKING, PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, OBESITY1) ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POOR TREATMENT RESPONSE, TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS, HEIGHTENED RECURRENCE RISK, DECREASED LONGEVITY, DIMINISHED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND INCREASED TREATMENT COST FOR MANY CANCERS2-8. THESE RISK BEHAVIORS ARE AT LEAST AS PREVALENT IN CANCER PATIENTS AS THEY ARE IN HEALTHY ADULTS, BUT REFERRAL PATHWAYS TO TREAT THEM ARE NOT ROUTINELY INTEGRATED INTO CANCER CARE. BY INTEGRATING CANCER RISK BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT INTO THE EHR AND AUTOMATING REFERRAL, WE PLAN TO MAKE TELEHEALTH-ENABLED TREATMENT OF HEALTH RISK BEHAVIORS (A CLINICAL SERVICE CALLED HEALTH PROMOTION) ACCESSIBLE TO CANCER PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS THROUGHOUT NORTHWESTERN\u2019S CLINICAL PRACTICE NETWORK IN A MANNER THAT IS AFFORDABLE, IMPROVES CARE QUALITY, AND IS MINIMALLY DISRUPTIVE TO CLINICAL WORKFLOW. THE MPIS OF THIS PROPOSAL HAVE DEVELOPED, AND ARE EXPERTS AT, REMOTELY ASSESSING PATIENT SYMPTOMS AND DELIVERING EFFECTIVE, INEXPENSIVE, TELEHEALTH TREATMENT OF CANCER\u2019S MOST PREVALENT AND POTENT, BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS. PHYSICAL INACTIVITY9, OBESITY10, SMOKING11 OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT TELEHEALTH, AS COMPARED TO IN-PERSON CANCER CARE, MAY MAKE TREATMENT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO OLDER ADULTS AND MINORITIES. WITH CANCER MOONSHOT AND OTHER FUNDS, WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY DEVELOPED PATIENT-REPORTED ASSESSMENT, SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, AND SHARED DECISION-MAKING TOOLS THAT ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE SINGLE EHR (EPIC) SYSTEM THAT LINKS THE NORTHWESTERN MEMORIAL HEALTHCARE CORPORATION\u2019S (NMHC)11-HOSPITAL HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE ALSO DEVELOPED A SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAM OFFERED THROUGHOUT NMHC. IN RESPONSE TO DEMAND FROM NM\u2019S CANCER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT GROUP, WE NOW PROPOSE TO IMPLEMENT, OPTIMIZE, EVALUATE, AND DISSEMINATE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE, FULLY INTEGRATED, PATIENT-CENTERED, TECHNOLOGY-ASSISTED TELEHEALTH RISK BEHAVIOR TREATMENT PROGRAM THAT PROACTIVELY ADDRESSES PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, OBESITY, AND TOBACCO USE FOR CANCER PATIENTS IN THE NMHC SYSTEM.

IN PARTICULAR, LATINOS HAVE THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE AND AMONG THE LOWEST SURVIVAL RATES FOR LEUKEMIA IN THE U.S. THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THIS DISPARITY ARE MULTI-FACTORIAL, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN TUMOR AND HOST BIOLOGY, AS WELL AS SOCIAL/BEHAVIORAL FACTORS SUCH AS LIMITED HEALTHCARE ACCESS. HOST PHARMACOGENOMICS AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL FACTORS RESULTING IN INCREASED TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES ARE A KEY AND UNDER-STUDIED CAUSE OF ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN OUTCOMES. ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULT BOTH FROM DIRECT TREATMENT-ASSOCIATED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, AND FROM COMPROMISED ABILITY TO DELIVER SUFFICIENTLY INTENSIVE ANTI- LEUKEMIC THERAPY. THE OVERALL GOALS OF THIS P20 PROGRAM ARE TO REDUCE OUTCOME DISPARITIES AMONG LATINO CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS BY IDENTIFYING HOST BIOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT RESULT IN INCREASED TOXICITIES, AND TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS OF RESEARCH EXCELLENCE (SPORE) DEVOTED TO PEDIATRIC LEUKEMIA.

HCC IS NOW THE 6TH LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER-RELATED DEATH IN THE U.S. IT IS PROJECTED TO SURPASS BREAST AND COLORECTAL CANCER TO BECOME THE 3RD LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER-RELATED DEATH BY 2030. AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE (AI/AN) PEOPLE FACE A DISPROPORTIONALLY HIGH BURDEN OF HCC. AI/AN PEOPLE HAVE 2.4 TIMES HIGHER HCC INCIDENCE AND 2.5 TIMES HIGHER HCC-RELATED MORTALITY THAN WHITE PERSONS. AI/AN PEOPLE HAVE A VERY HIGH INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE HCC SUCH AS VIRAL HEPATITIS C AND B, ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS, NAFLD/NASH, OBESITY AND DIABETES. ADDITIONALLY, AI/AN PATIENTS HAVE UNIQUE RISK FACTORS AND PATHOGENETIC MECHANISMS FOR HCC DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS HIGH PREVALENCE OF INFECTION WITH HBV GENOTYPE F1B, UNIQUE MUTATIONS IN THE CORE REGION OF HBV GENOTYPE F1B AND HIGH EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTANTS (PARTICULATE MATTER <2.5\u039cM OR \u201cPM2.5\u201d), WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED CARCINOGENS. THE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR LIVER CANCER IN AI/AN DISPARITIES (LI-CAD) P20 PROGRAM IS TO ELIMINATE DISPARITIES IN EARLY DETECTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE MOST CRITICAL DISPARITIES AND DEFICIENCIES IN HCC MANAGEMENT, AND THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT, LIE IN EARLY DETECTION. THE OVERARCHING AIM OF THIS P20 PROGRAM IS TO APPLY NOVEL, INNOVATIVE, TRANSLATIONAL APPROACHES TO SURVEILLANCE AND EARLY DETECTION OF HCC THAT ARE INFORMED BY UNIQUE ASPECTS OF HCC PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY IN AI/AN PEOPLE IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE DISPARITIES, IMPROVE EARLY DETECTION AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE HCC-RELATED MORTALITY.
