THE SAKI WORKING GROUP MUST FIRST SCRUTINIZE THESE CASES PRIOR TO SUBMITTING THEM TO THE MDT WHO WILL DETERMINE WHETHER TO PROCEED WITH ADDITIONAL TESTING. CASES THAT YIELD CONCLUSIVE RESULTS WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES. MOST OF OUR ORIGINAL SAKI CASES WERE COMMITTED BY SERIAL OFFENDERS. THE DEDICATED PROSECUTOR WILL HANDLE THE PROSECUTION OF THE COMPLEX CASES THAT RESULT FROM THE TESTING OF THE SECONDARY ITEMS OF EVIDENCE. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL PROVIDE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING DELIVERABLES: DETERMINE WHICH ITEMS OF SECONDARY EVIDENCE SHOULD BE SUBMITTED FOR FURTHER DNA ANALYSIS, EVALUATE CASES TO USE Y-STR, ADVANCED DNA TESTING METHODS AND FGG/FGGS ON, FUND A CRIME ANALYST POSITION TO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH INTELLIGENCE ANALYSES AND VICAP ENTRY/ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS FURTHER A VICTIM-CENTERED, TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACH AND LEAD TO ADDITIONAL CASES THAT WILL BE HANDLED BY THE DEDICATED PROSECUTOR. \n\nTHESE EFFORTS WILL HELP PREVENT FURTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY BY HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS WHILE ALSO SERVING SURVIVORS AND THE COMMUNITY. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND HOPE TO CONTINUE A PARTNERSHIP THAT MAKES AN IMPACT IN THE LIVES OF SURVIVORS AND ENHANCES PUBLIC SAFETY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3be5542a-e13e-ce70-1db5-f55e45075fd2-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJA21GG04305SAKI_1550"}]
