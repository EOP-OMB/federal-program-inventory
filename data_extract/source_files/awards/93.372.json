HOWEVER, THIS CONTINUOUS STIMULATION THERAPY IS LIMITED TO TREATMENT OF A SUBSET OF MOTOR SYMPTOMS (I.E., TREMOR, RIGIDITY, BRADYKINESIA AND DYSKINESIAS) AND REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE POSTOPERATIVE CLINICAL ADJUSTMENT TO TREAT SYMPTOMS. IMPROVEMENTS TO DBS FOR PD ARE BEING TESTED, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PATTERNS OF STIMULATION, ADDITIONAL TARGETS, AND MULTIPLE ELECTRODES. HOWEVER, A CRITICAL NEW APPROACH INVOLVES AUTONOMOUS PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT [ADAPTIVE DBS] USING SURROGATE PHYSIOLOGICAL BIOMARKERS RELEVANT TO CLINICAL SYMPTOMS. THESE BIOMARKERS AND AUTONOMOUS CONTROL MAY BE USEFUL FOR DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT, SUBSEQUENT PROGRAMMING, AND LONG-TERM OPTIMIZATION OF PARAMETERS. ADAPTIVE DBS INVOLVES RECORDING SURROGATE SIGNALS AND DEVELOPING A CONTROL POLICY THAT RELATES THESE SIGNALS TO ACTIVITY THROUGH PARAMETER ADJUSTMENTS. THIS APPROACH COULD IMPROVE DBS THERAPY ACROSS MULTIPLE TIME SCALES, INCLUDING SHORT-TERM DYNAMICS (I.E., OVER MINUTES), INITIAL PROGRAMMING (OVER WEEKS TO MONTHS), AND LONG-TERM, DEPENDING ON THE TIME COURSE OF RESPONSE TO DBS. HOWEVER, WHICH BIOMARKERS ARE USEFUL AT THESE VARIOUS TIME SCALES AND APPROPRIATE, MULTI- LAYERED CONTROL POLICY, WILL REQUIRE TESTING IN COMPARISON TO CONTINUOUS DBS FOR RELATIVE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT INTEGRATING MULTIPLE BIOMARKERS (IN ADDITION TO BETA BAND OSCILLATIONS) ACROSS MULTIPLE TIME SCALES WILL PROVIDE MORE EFFICACIOUS ADAPTIVE DBS CONTROL. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS WE WILL PERFORM LONG-TERM RECORDINGS OF MULTIPLE, RELEVANT BIOMARKERS FROM HUMANS WITH IMPLANTED, ADVANCED IMPLANTABLE PULSE GENERATORS [IPGS], COMPARING INTERNAL CONTROL MODES TO HIGHLY COMPLEX EXTERNAL CONTROL MODES. THESE CLINICAL EXPERIMENTS WILL FOCUS ON A SMALL, PILOT CLINICAL STUDY (N = 6 PD PATIENTS) WHO HAVE UNDERGONE IMPLANTATION OF BILATERAL SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS [STN] AND GLOBUS PALLIDUS [GP] DBS ELECTRODES, WITH ALL 4 ELECTRODES CONNECTED TO A SINGLE MEDTRONIC SUMMIT RC+S RECORDING AND STIMULATING IPG. WE HAVE FORMALLY ANALYZED THIS COHORT FOR EFFICACY AT 1 YEAR, SHOWING THAT COMBINED STN + GP STIMULATION IS BOTH PREFERRED AND BETTER COMPARED TO EITHER SITE ALONE. WE WILL ANALYZE THE COMPARATIVE EFFICACY OF INTERNAL (EMBEDDED, AVAILABLE WITHIN THE IPG) SIMPLE ADAPTIVE DBS TO EXTERNAL (DISTRIBUTED) ADAPTIVE DBS, WHICH ALLOWS BOTH INTEGRATING MULTIPLE BIOMARKERS AND USING A COMPLEX, MULTIPLE TIME SCALE CONTROL POLICY. WE WILL FURTHER DEVELOP A PROPORTIONAL CONTROL FEEDBACK PROGRAM, WHICH SPECIFICALLY INTEGRATES THE TIME MULTIPLE TIME CONSTANTS OF PD SYMPTOMS, TO OPTIMALLY CONTROL PD SYMPTOM. THESE CLINICAL EXPERIMENTS IN A UNIQUE COHORT OF RESEARCH PATIENTS WILL LEAD TO MULTIPLE NOVEL OUTCOMES, CONTINUING A DIRECT, WITHIN-PERSON COMPARISON OF STN, GP, AND COMBINED DBS EFFICACY, ANALYZING AN OPTIMAL MIX OF SURROGATE BIOMARKERS FOR ENHANCING DBS EFFICACY, AND DEFINING AN OPTIMAL, SCALAR FEEDBACK, PROPORTIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR TREATMENT ON VARIOUS TIME SCALES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6f191f83-6024-f2be-3012-4b740b10ac7a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UH3NS129898_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160943809, "Award ID": "UH3NS125162", "Award Amount": 1042208.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-07-12", "CFDA Number": "93.372", "Description": "THALAMIC COORDINATED RESET DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION FOR UPPER EXTREMITY ESSENTIAL TREMOR: PROOF OF PRINCIPLE STUDY - ESSENTIAL TREMOR (ET) IS A COMMON NEUROLOGIC DISORDER AFFECTING OVER 10 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. PATHOLOGIC SYNCHRONY IN THE CEREBELLO-THALAMO-CORTICAL (CTC) NETWORK HAS BEEN CONSIDERED TO UNDERLIE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ET. TRADITIONAL HIGH FREQUENCY ISOCHRONAL DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION (T-DBS) IN THE VENTRAL INTERMEDIATE NUCLEUS (VIM) OF THE THALAMUS HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR ET, HOWEVER, STIMULATION RELATED SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS DYSARTHRIA AND ATAXIA OCCUR IN AT LEAST 30% OF PATIENTS. CURRENT SPREAD INTO UNINTENDED BRAIN AREAS HAS BEEN CONSIDERED TO UNDERLIE MOST OBSERVED SIDE EFFECTS RELATED TO STIMULATION. MOREOVER, HABITUATION, DEFINED AS LOSS OF EFFECT DESPITE OPTIMAL PROGRAMMING, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN 30-50% OF PATIENTS. THE CAUSE OF HABITUATION TO DBS IS STILL UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, IT MAY REFLECT RESYNCHRONIZATION IN THE CTC NETWORK. COORDINATED RESET (CR) STIMULATION IS A NOVEL DBS APPROACH DEVELOPED TO COUNTERACT ABNORMAL SYNCHRONIZATION IN THE NEURONAL NETWORK WHICH CAN ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. BY USING LOWER CURRENT AMPLITUDES AND ALTERNATING STIMULATION ACROSS MULTIPLE CONTACTS OF THE DBS LEAD, CR-DBS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE PATIENTS TO PRODUCE ACUTE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS COMPARABLE TO T-DBS AS WELL AS CARRYOVER BENEFITS THAT PERSIST FOR DAYS OR WEEKS AFTER CESSATION OF STIMULATION.

THIS APPROACH IS BASED ON OUR CONCEPTUAL MODEL THAT MDD IS A DYNAMIC PROCESS IN WHICH SYMPTOMS ARISE WHEN DYSFUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY EMERGES IN ONE OR MORE BRAIN MOOD-RELATED NETWORKS. THE NETWORKS AFFECTED DIFFER AMONG INDIVIDUALS LEADING TO SYMPTOM HETEROGENEITY. OUR APPROACH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MAXIMIZE EFFICACY BY PERSONALIZING STIMULUS LOCATION TARGETING WHILE MINIMIZING THE STIMULATION NEEDED TO MAINTAIN A THERAPEUTIC EFFECT, THEREBY MINIMIZING SIDE-EFFECTS AND NEURAL ADAPTATION AND PRESERVING DEVICE LONGEVITY. WE PROPOSE A 3-STAGE FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND INITIAL EFFICACY STUDY BASED ON OUR PILOT WORK TO TEST THIS APPROACH IN 12 PATIENTS WITH SEVERE TRMDD.

PROJECT SUMMARY MULTIPLE EARLY FEASIBILITY TRIALS IN HUMANS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IMPLANTABLE BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES (BCIS) CAN ENABLE PEOPLE WITH SEVERE PARALYSIS TO USE NEURAL SIGNALS TO CONTROL REMOTE AND DIGITAL COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING MESSAGING AND EMAIL. SUCH STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED CLEARLY THAT BCIS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE PHYSICAL DISABILITY DUE TO PARALYSIS OF SPEECH AND UPPER LIMBS. HOWEVER, UNTIL THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE COMMERCIALIZED, ACCESS TO BCIS WILL REMAIN LIMITED TO PEOPLE INVOLVED IN RESEARCH STUDIES, AND ONLY FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR ENROLMENT IN THE STUDY. TO ADDRESS THIS UNMET NEED, SYNCHRON, INC. HAS DEVELOPED THE STENTRODETM SYSTEM, A FULLY IMPLANTABLE BCI THAT COMMUNICATES WIRELESSLY TO AN EXTERNAL INTERFACE ON A MOBILE COMPUTING PLATFORM. THE STENTRODETM BCI IS A 16-CHANNEL ARRAY OF SENSORS INTEGRATED INTO A SELF-EXPANDING, STENT-LIKE SUBSTRATE. THE STENTRODETM IS DELIVERED ENDOVASCULARLY VIA A CATHETER TO THE SUPERIOR SAGITTAL SINUS, WHERE IT MEASURES VOLITIONALLY-MODULATED NEURAL SIGNALS FROM THE LEG AREA OF MOTOR CORTEX IN BOTH HEMISPHERES. A FULLY IMPLANTABLE, WIRELESS TELEMETRY UNIT DIGITIZES AND TRANSMITS THE NEURAL SIGNALS FROM THE STENTRODETM TO AN EXTERNAL MOBILE PROCESSOR THAT CONVERTS THE NEURAL SIGNALS INTO COMMANDS FOR OPERATING A COMPUTER OR OTHER ASSISTIVE DEVICE, SUCH AS A SPELLER FOR COMMUNICATION. THE SYNCHRON TEAM HAS ALREADY INITIATED A FIRST-IN-HUMAN TRIAL OF THE STENTRODETM BCI SYSTEM IN MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, UNDER APPROVALS GRANTED BY THE THERAPEUTIC GOODS ADMINISTRATION (TGA) OF AUSTRALIA AND THE IRB OF THE ROYAL MELBOURNE HOSPITAL. THE FIRST HUMAN IMPLANT WAS PERFORMED IN A PERSON WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS) IN AUGUST, 2019. THE PARTICIPANT HAS EXPERIENCED NO ADVERSE EVENTS AND IS USING THE SYSTEM TO OPERATE A COMPUTER AND TYPE MESSAGES TO FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND CAREGIVERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE IN AN EARLY FEASIBILITY STUDY (EFS) THAT THE STENTRODETM BCI COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING A QUANTIFIABLE IMPROVEMENT IN INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN N=6 PEOPLE WITH SEVERE PARALYSIS DUE TO ALS. TWO SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED: 1) PRECLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE STENTRODETM FOR SAFETY AND FUNCTIONALITY TO COMPLETE AN FDA SUBMISSION, AND 2) TESTING OF STENTRODETM\u2019S SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN AN EFS CLINICAL TRIAL IN TWO CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE IN THE USA.

CONSIDER THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THE CORTEX IS BURIED BEYOND THE REACH OF MOST STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGIES. WE HAVE DESIGNED A NOVEL APPROACH TO BRAIN RECORDINGS TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE OF MULTI-SCALE RECORDINGS AT ANY DESIRED DEPTH. OUR TEAM PRESENTS A NOVEL DEVICE WHOSE FORM IS BASED ON THE PROVEN SAFETY AND UTILITY OF THE STEREO-EEG (SEEG). WE CREATED A DIRECTIONAL AND SCALABLE LOCAL FIELD POTENTIAL ARRAY (DISC) USING THE PHENOMENON OF \"SUBSTRATE SHIELDING\". THIS IS NOT THE FIRST COMBINATION MICRO/MACRO DEVICE BUT IS THE FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE STEREO-LOCAL FIELD POTENTIALS USING A PATENT PENDING DESIGN. OUR PRELIMINARY IN VIVO DATA DEMONSTRATES SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WHEN USING DISC IN MANY CRITICAL FACTORS PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE BCI PERFORMANCE: (I) SIGNAL AMPLITUDE, (II) SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO, AND (III) SOURCE SEPARATION IN CLASSIFICATION TASKS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALLOW US TO SAFELY TEST WORD DECODING PERFORMANCE BOTH OFFLINE AND ONLINE IN EPILEPSY VOLUNTEERS FROM SPEECH REGIONS. THE PROJECT'S FIRST AIM IS TO DEVELOP A ROBUST DISC HYBRID ASSEMBLY WITH 128 OR MORE RECORDING CHANNELS PER IMPLANT. EACH IMPLANTED DEVICE WILL BE A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SEEG COMBINED WITH MICROELECTRODES WITHOUT ANY MODIFICATION TO THE CLINICAL FUNCTION OF THE DEVICE. AIM 1 WILL INCLUDE VERIFICATION, VALIDATION, BIOCOMPATIBILITY, AND ELECTRICAL SAFETY TESTING. AIM 1 WILL ALSO INCLUDE FUNCTIONAL AND SAFETY STUDIES IN ANIMALS TO COMPLETE OUR EFFORT TO PROVIDE A SAFE, RELIABLE SYSTEM PRIOR TO HUMAN FEASIBILITY STUDIES. AFTER ALL MILESTONES ARE MET, INCLUDING RECEIVING AN FDA INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION, THIS NOVEL RECORDING SYSTEM WILL DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECT SIZE AND VARIANCE OF WORD AND SPEECH DECODING IN HUMANS AS COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL RING ELECTRODES. TYPICALLY, 12-20 DEPTH ARRAYS ARE USED IN EPILEPTOGENIC MONITORING AND WE WILL REPLACE TWO DEPTH ELECTRODES WITH A DISC HYBRID ASSEMBLY IN 8 EXPERIMENTAL PATIENTS AND COMPARE DECODING PERFORMANCE TO THE WITHIN-PATIENT CONTROLS AND WITH A SEPARATE 8 PATIENTS HAVING SEEG ELECTRODES ONLY. ENROLLED VOLUNTEERS WILL CONDUCT OVERT AND COVERT SPEECH TASKS.

PROJECT GOAL: HERE WE AIM AT TESTING THE EFFICACY OF A SYSTEM DELIVERING ELECTRICAL NEUROSTIMULATION TO THE CERVI- CAL SPINAL CORD (SCS) TO IMPROVE ARM AND HAND MOTOR CONTROL IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC POST-STROKE HEMIPARESIS HYPOTHESIS: SCS OF THE LUMBOSACRAL CIRCUITS BELOW THE LESION IMMEDIATELY RESTORED LEG MOVEMENTS AND WEIGHT BEARING LOCOMOTION IN HUMANS WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY BY INCREASING STRENGTH AND FUNCTION. MOREOVER, SCS COM- BINED TO PHYSICAL THERAPY LED TO LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS THAT IMPROVED MOTOR CONTROL EVEN WHEN THE STIMULATION WAS TURNED OFF. IN STROKE THE SPINAL CIRCUITS CONTROLLING ARM AND HAND MOVEMENTS ARE INTACT AND LOCATED BELOW THE BRAIN LESION. THEREFORE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SCS TARGETING THE CERVICAL SPINAL CORD WILL ENABLE PEOPLE WITH POST-STROKE HEMIPARESIS TO PRODUCE FUNCTIONAL ARM AND HAND MOVEMENTS, AND THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL EN- ABLE THE ADMINISTRATION OF A TAILORED BEHAVIORAL TRAINING LEADING TO SUPERIOR LONG-TERM MOTOR RECOVERY. PRELIMINARY DATA: WE IMPLANTED A HUMAN SUBJECT WITH POST-STROKE HEMIPARESIS WITH LATERAL CERVICAL SPINAL LEADS AND SHOWED THAT SCS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED, STRENGTH AT EVERY JOINT OF THE ARM AND HAND, RANGE OF MOTIONS, DEXTERITY, CLINICAL ASSESSMENT SCALES (FUGL-MEYER +13) AND FUNCTIONAL ABILITIES.

PROJECT SUMMARY MULTIPLE EARLY FEASIBILITY TRIALS IN HUMANS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IMPLANTABLE BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES (BCIS) CAN ENABLE PEOPLE WITH SEVERE PARALYSIS TO USE NEURAL SIGNALS TO CONTROL REMOTE AND DIGITAL COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING MESSAGING AND EMAIL. SUCH STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED CLEARLY THAT BCIS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE PHYSICAL DISABILITY DUE TO PARALYSIS OF SPEECH AND UPPER LIMBS. HOWEVER, UNTIL THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE COMMERCIALIZED, ACCESS TO BCIS WILL REMAIN LIMITED TO PEOPLE INVOLVED IN RESEARCH STUDIES, AND ONLY FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR ENROLMENT IN THE STUDY. TO ADDRESS THIS UNMET NEED, SYNCHRON, INC. HAS DEVELOPED THE STENTRODETM SYSTEM, A FULLY IMPLANTABLE BCI THAT COMMUNICATES WIRELESSLY TO AN EXTERNAL INTERFACE ON A MOBILE COMPUTING PLATFORM. THE STENTRODETM BCI IS A 16-CHANNEL ARRAY OF SENSORS INTEGRATED INTO A SELF-EXPANDING, STENT-LIKE SUBSTRATE. THE STENTRODETM IS DELIVERED ENDOVASCULARLY VIA A CATHETER TO THE SUPERIOR SAGITTAL SINUS, WHERE IT MEASURES VOLITIONALLY-MODULATED NEURAL SIGNALS FROM THE LEG AREA OF MOTOR CORTEX IN BOTH HEMISPHERES. A FULLY IMPLANTABLE, WIRELESS TELEMETRY UNIT DIGITIZES AND TRANSMITS THE NEURAL SIGNALS FROM THE STENTRODETM TO AN EXTERNAL MOBILE PROCESSOR THAT CONVERTS THE NEURAL SIGNALS INTO COMMANDS FOR OPERATING A COMPUTER OR OTHER ASSISTIVE DEVICE, SUCH AS A SPELLER FOR COMMUNICATION. THE SYNCHRON TEAM HAS ALREADY INITIATED A FIRST-IN-HUMAN TRIAL OF THE STENTRODETM BCI SYSTEM IN MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, UNDER APPROVALS GRANTED BY THE THERAPEUTIC GOODS ADMINISTRATION (TGA) OF AUSTRALIA AND THE IRB OF THE ROYAL MELBOURNE HOSPITAL. THE FIRST HUMAN IMPLANT WAS PERFORMED IN A PERSON WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS) IN AUGUST, 2019. THE PARTICIPANT HAS EXPERIENCED NO ADVERSE EVENTS AND IS USING THE SYSTEM TO OPERATE A COMPUTER AND TYPE MESSAGES TO FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND CAREGIVERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE IN AN EARLY FEASIBILITY STUDY (EFS) THAT THE STENTRODETM BCI COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING A QUANTIFIABLE IMPROVEMENT IN INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN N=6 PEOPLE WITH SEVERE PARALYSIS DUE TO ALS. TWO SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED: 1) PRECLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE STENTRODETM FOR SAFETY AND FUNCTIONALITY TO COMPLETE AN FDA SUBMISSION, AND 2) TESTING OF STENTRODETM\u2019S SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN AN EFS CLINICAL TRIAL IN TWO CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE IN THE USA. UNDER AIM 1 (UG3 PHASE), PRECLINICAL SAFETY STUDIES AND SOFTWARE VALIDATION IN LARGE ANIMAL STUDIES WILL BE COMPLETED TO TEST ROBUSTNESS OF STENTRODETM, COMPLIANCE TO SAFETY STANDARDS FOR CLASS III ELECTROMECHANICAL IMPLANTS, SAFETY AND BASELINE FUNCTIONALITY IN A LARGE ANIMAL MODEL, EFFICACY OF CUSTOM-BUILT SOFTWARE, AND A FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING STUDY TO SUPPORT PRESURGICAL PLANNING. UNDER AIM 2 (UH3 PHASE), AN EFS STUDY WILL TEST SAFETY OF STENTRODETM PLACEMENT, MONITORING ADVERSE EVENTS, TARGET PATENCY, AND DEVICE MIGRATION. WHEN COMBINED WITH EYE-TRACKING TECHNOLOGY, USERS WILL BE TRAINED TO PERFORM COMPUTER-BASED TASKS USING EYE-GAZE TO CONTROL CURSOR POSITION AND BCI OUTPUTS TO CONTROL DISCRETE ACTIONS, SUCH AS LETTER OR MENU-ITEM SELECTION AND ZOOM.

AMONG THE MORE THAN 1,000,000 AMERICANS WITH UNCONTROLLED FOCAL EPILEPSY, MANY HAVE POORLY LOCALIZED SEIZURE FOCI. THESE INDIVIDUALS FACE THE HIGHEST RATES OF \u2018FAILURE\u2019 (I.E., ONGOING SEIZURES) AFTER EPILEPSY SURGERY. THAT FAILURE REFLECTS THE BIOLOGY OF THEIR EPILEPSY AS WELL AS THE OVERLAP OF SEIZURE FOCI WITH ESSENTIAL CORTICAL AREAS. HOWEVER, LIMITS OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES ALSO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE HIGH FAILURE RATE AS WE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO SAMPLE WIDE REGIONS OF THE NEOCORTEX (I.E., STEREOEEG) OR TO RECORD BROAD NEOCORTICAL REGIONS WITHOUT INDUCING PAIN, SWELLING, AND NEUROINFLAMMATORY TISSUE DAMAGE (I.E., SUBDURAL GRID AND STRIP RECORDINGS).

ONLY 36% OF INFANTS (<1YR OLD) TREATED FOR OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST AND 69% OF INFANTS THAT SUFFER IN-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST ARE SUCCESSFULLY RESUSCITATED. THESE INFANTS CURRENTLY HAVE NO THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS TO LIMIT BRAIN INJURY. THE CURRENT STANDARD TREATMENT FOR POST-CARDIAC ARREST BRAIN INJURY IS THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA. UNFORTUNATELY, RECENT STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT USE OF THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA IN PEDIATRIC CARDIAC ARREST PATIENTS DOES NOT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT BEYOND WHAT IS ACHIEVED WITH CONTROLLED NORMOTHERMIA. A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE NEUROPROTECTIVE INTERVENTION THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGETS REPERFUSION INJURY WOULD FILL A CRITICAL UNMET NEED IN THE TREATMENT OF THESE VULNERABLE PATIENTS.

TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE NEXGEN SCANNER BUILDS UPON EXISTING STANDARD 7T SCANNERS AND INTEGRATES A NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, CREATING SYNERGISTIC IMPROVEMENTS AND GAINS IN SPEED, RESOLUTION AND SIGNAL. SUCH ADVANCES INCLUDE: CURRENTLY THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE ONE-OF-A-KIND HEAD-ONLY MAGNETIC GRADIENT COIL DESIGNED TO SAFELY CREATE MORE SIGNAL AT FASTER TIME SCALES (HIGHER GRADIENT AMPLITUDES AND SLEW RATES WITHOUT PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATION; PNS), HIGH-DENSITY RECEIVER ARRAY COILS (E.G.

TO DATE, ECHO-PLANAR IMAGING (EPI) HAS BEEN THE STANDARD FMRI ACQUISITION METHOD, BUT SUFFERS FROM INTRINSIC LIMITATIONS SUCH AS STATIC AND DYNAMIC DISTORTION, IMAGE/CONTRAST BLURRING, SIGNAL VOIDS, SUBOPTIMAL CNR AND PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISES. THESE LIMITATIONS COMPROMISE THE SENSITIVITY AND RELIABILITY OF TASK AND RESTING-STATE FMRI, AND HINDER THE EFFECTIVE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND ACHIEVABLE FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICITY FOR STATE-OF-THE-ART HIGH-RESOLUTION LAMINAR OR COLUMNAR FMRI STUDIES, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THESE PROBLEMS BECOME MORE SEVERE AT HIGHER RESOLUTIONS AND FIELD STRENGTHS. ECHO-PLANAR TIME-RESOLVED IMAGING (EPTI) HAS RECENTLY BEEN INTRODUCED TO ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS. CONVENTIONAL IMAGE FORMATION GENERATES A SINGLE ECHO IMAGE FROM K-SPACE SAMPLES EVOLVING ACROSS TIME WITH ACCUMULATED IMPERFECTIONS. EPTI RECOGNIZES THE STRONG SPATIOTEMPORAL CORRELATION OF THE DATA DURING THE IMAGE ENCODING PROCESS, AND EXPLOITS IT TO REPLACE CONVENTIONAL IMAGE FORMATION AND RESOLVE MULTI-ECHO IMAGES FROM THE FULLY-RECOVERED SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA, MAKING THE ACQUISITION IMMUNE TO THESE IMPERFECTIONS.

THIS RENEWAL APPLICATION PROPOSES TO PURSUE POWERFUL NEW THEMES THAT EMERGED FROM OUR PREVIOUS WORK AND TO BROADEN OUR SCOPE SUBSTANTIALLY. TO DO SO, THE EIGHT PIS PLAN A TIGHTLY INTEGRATED SET OF EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES OF MICE DOING THE ACCUMULATING TOWERS TASK\u2014IN WHICH THEY MUST REMEMBER HOW MANY TOWERS FLASH ON EACH SIDE AS THEY RUN DOWN A MAZE IN VIRTUAL REALITY\u2014AND RELATED TASKS.  THE FIRST THEME ARISES FROM THE FINDING THAT NEURONS ACROSS THE BRAIN ENCODE TASK VARIABLES AND ARE NECESSARY FOR TASK PERFORMANCE. ALMOST ALL OF THESE AREAS EXHIBIT SEQUENTIAL ACTIVITY, IN WHICH NEURONS ARE ACTIVE AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE TASK AND, TOGETHER, TILE THE TRIAL DURATION. PROJECT 1 WILL IDENTIFY THE TASK FEATURES THAT DRIVE SEQUENTIAL ACTIVITY, USE COOLING TO IDENTIFY NEURAL CIRCUITS THAT GENERATE SEQUENTIAL ACTIVITY, AND ELUCIDATE ITS ANATOMICAL BASIS BY COMBINING TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELING.  A SECOND THEME IS THAT MANIFOLD INFERENCE METHODS, APPLIED TO LARGE-SCALE HIPPOCAMPAL RECORDINGS IN OUR TASK, REVEAL THE GEOMETRY OF A JOINT NEURAL REPRESENTATION FOR AN EXTERNAL VARIABLE (POSITION) AND AN INTERNAL, COGNITIVE VARIABLE (ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE). PROJECT 2 WILL EXTEND OUR WORK ON THE GEOMETRY OF NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS TO OTHER BRAIN REGIONS. WE WILL EXAMINE HOW GEOMETRIES AND REPRESENTATIONS IN THESE REGIONS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER, AND WE WILL DEVELOP MODELS TO EXPLAIN HOW THE OBSERVED NEURAL MANIFOLDS ARISE.  A THIRD THEME, FUELED BY OUR DEVELOPMENT OF STATISTICAL METHODS TO INFER INTERNAL BRAIN STATES, IS THAT ANIMALS\u2019 BRAINS OCCUPY QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT STATES FROM TRIAL TO TRIAL DURING THE SAME TASK BLOCK. OUR DATA SUGGESTS THAT BEHAVIOR IN EACH STATE REQUIRES DIFFERENT NEURAL STRUCTURES AND CIRCUITS\u2014IN THE SAME ANIMAL AND THE SAME TRIAL BLOCK.

WE PROPOSE THAT COORDINATED NEURAL ACTIVITY DURING SLEEP DRIVES GLOBAL AND LOCAL CHANGES IN BLOOD VOLUME, WHICH IN TURN ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF CSF TRANSPORT.

THIS PROPHECY TURNED OUT TO BE ACCURATE. ASTROCYTES, ONE OF THE MOST ABUNDANT CELL TYPES IN THE BRAIN, HAVE LONG BEEN THOUGHT OF AS PRIMARILY PASSIVE SUPPORT CELLS. OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, STUDIES INDICATE THAT ASTROCYTES PLAY PIVOTAL ROLES IN NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT, FUNCTION, AND DISEASES. HOWEVER, A MAJOR UNRESOLVED ISSUE IN NEUROSCIENCE IS HOW ASTROCYTES INTEGRATE DIVERSE NEURONAL SIGNALS UNDER HEALTHY CONDITIONS, MODULATE NEURAL CIRCUIT STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AT MULTIPLE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES, AND HOW ABERRANT EXCITATION AND MOLECULAR OUTPUT INFLUENCES SENSORIMOTOR BEHAVIOR AND CONTRIBUTES TO DISEASE.

TWO OVERARCHING QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED: 1) HOW DO ASTROCYTES TEMPORALLY AND SPATIALLY INTEGRATE MOLECULAR SIGNALS FROM THE DIVERSE TYPES OF LOCAL AND PROJECTION NEURONS ACTIVATED DURING SENSORIMOTOR BEHAVIORS. 2) HOW DO ASTROCYTES CONVERT THIS INFORMATION INTO FUNCTIONAL OUTPUTS THAT MODULATE NEURAL CIRCUIT STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES.

WE WILL USE THIS KNOWLEDGE TO FORM A MATHEMATICAL RELATION BETWEEN THE HEMODYNAMIC PATTERNS OBSERVED IN OPTICAL AND FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING EXPERIMENTS AND THE UNDERLYING BRAIN STATE.  OUR PROPOSED STUDIES PROPOSE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXPERIMENTAL EXPERTISE IN IN VIVO OPTICAL MICROSCOPY IN MOUSE AND FMRI IN MOUSE AND HUMAN. THESE PRIMARY MODALITIES FOR DATA ACQUISITION ARE COMBINED WITH BEHAVIORAL TRAINING, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, AND DATA ANALYSIS. OUR EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT IS PARALLEL BY TWO THEORETICAL EFFORTS. ONE MIXED ANALYTICAL/COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT IS ON COUPLED OSCILLATOR DYNAMICS TO FORMULATE MODELS, AT VARYING LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY, OF THE PIAL NEUROVASCULAR CIRCUIT. A SECOND SOLELY COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT CONCERNS THE MODULATION OF THE TRANSPORT OF OXYGEN, BY REGIONAL OSCILLATIONS OF THE PIAL NEUROVASCULAR CIRCUIT.  THE PIAL NEUROVASCULAR CIRCUIT IS COMPOSED OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL NETWORK OF PIAL ARTERIOLES THAT UNDERGO RHYTHMIC OSCILLATIONS IN THE ~ 0.1 HZ VASOMOTOR BAND. EACH ELEMENT IN THIS CIRCUIT - A SEGMENT OF ARTERIOLE WHOSE DIAMETER IS MODULATED BY THE CONSTRICTION/DILATION OF SMOOTH MUSCLE, CONTAINS AN INTRINSIC RHYTHM GENERATOR, MUCH LIKE INTRINSIC BURSTING NEURONS IN CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS. THE PIAL ARTERIOLES INTEGRATE NEURONAL ACTIVITY FROM NEIGHBORING ARTERIOLES, UNDERLYING NEURONS, SUBCORTICAL NEURONS, AND NEUROMODULATORY CENTERS TO PRODUCE DYNAMIC PATTERNS OF COHERENT OSCILLATIONS IN ARTERIOLAR DIAMETER ACROSS THE CORTICAL MANTLE. THESE PATTERNS CONTAIN REGIONS THAT OSCILLATE AT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES, I.E., THEY PARCELLATE INTO SEPARATE REGIONS. THE FASCINATING ISSUE IS THAT THE PARCELLATION ONLY PARTIALLY REFLECTS INPUT FROM THE DIRECTLY UNDERLYING NEURONAL INPUT. WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND, MODEL, AND EXPLOIT THIS PARCELLATION.  THE PIS HAVE COLLABORATED ON ISSUES IN NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROVASCULAR SCIENCE FOR MANY YEARS.

THIS PROPOSAL\u2019S OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW INTERNAL STATES INFLUENCE DECISIONS AND TO IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING NEURAL MECHANISMS. IN A MOUSE DECISION-MAKING TASK, THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF THREE TYPES OF INTERNAL STATE CHANGES: THOSE ARISING SPONTANEOUSLY WITH ENGAGEMENT AND DISENGAGEMENT IN A TASK, THOSE RESULTING FROM CHANGING EXPECTATIONS DURING THE TASK, AND THOSE RESULTING FROM LEARNING WITHIN AND ACROSS DAYS.

HOWEVER, THE CORTEX DOES NOT GENERATE THESE ACTIVITY MODES IN ISOLATION, BUT INSTEAD IS STRONGLY AND BIDIRECTIONALLY COUPLED TO THE THALAMUS, THE CENTRAL HUB OF THE FOREBRAIN. MOST OF THALAMUS IS NON- SENSORY (\u2018HIGHER-ORDER\u2019), RECEIVING SUBCORTICAL INPUT FROM THE CEREBELLUM, MIDBRAIN, AND HIPPOCAMPUS.

IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT OPTICAL IMAGING WITH GENETICALLY-ENCODED FLUORESCENT CALCIUM SENSORS IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY METHOD TO OBTAIN MEASUREMENTS OF GENETICALLY-IDENTIFIED NEURONAL POPULATIONS WITH DENSE SAMPLING. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE RECORDING CAPABILITIES OF TWO-PHOTON MICROSCOPES HAVE BEEN IMPROVED TO RECORD FROM MILLIMETER-SCALE TISSUE, AND NEW MINIATURIZED MICROSCOPES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO RECORD FROM MOVING MICE. HOWEVER, MOST BEHAVIORS ARISE FROM COLLECTIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NEURONS FROM MULTIPLE BRAIN AREAS, WHICH CANNOT BE SIMULTANEOUSLY MONITORED WITH THESE SYSTEMS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A CLEAR NEED TO DEVELOP A NEW APPROACH TO DIRECTLY MONITOR THE SYNCHRONIZED ACTIVITY OF DISTRIBUTED NEURAL CIRCUITS. CAMPARI IS A UNIQUE CALCIUM SENSOR THAT CAN DETECT ACTIVITY IN TWO CALCIUM-DEPENDENT WAYS: 1) PERMANENT COLOR CHANGE (GREEN TO RED) UPON ILLUMINATION WITH VIOLET LIGHT, A PROCESS KNOWN AS PHOTOCONVERSION, AND 2) DYNAMIC CHANGES IN FLUORESCENCE INTENSITY. OUR DATA SHOW THAT CAMPARI ALLOWS RECORDING OF BRAIN ACTIVITY FROM FREELY-BEHAVING MICE, WITHOUT USING MICROSCOPE OBJECTIVES OR IMPLANTED DEVICES. MOREOVER, NATURAL DEGRADATION OF THE RED CAMPARI PROTEIN ENABLES MULTIPLE LONGITUDINAL MEASUREMENTS. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE CAMPARI USING IN VITRO ASSAYS REDUCED SOME OF ITS IN VIVO PROPERTIES, WHICH RESULTED IN LOW DYNAMIC RECORDING SENSITIVITY AND A LOW PHOTOCONVERSION RATE THAT REQUIRES LONG ILLUMINATION TIMES TO ACCUMULATE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF RED PROTEIN.

DESPITE TREMENDOUS RECENT PROGRESS, IBCI PERFORMANCE REMAINS WELL BELOW THAT OF ABLE-BODIED PEOPLE. IN PRIOR NIH- SUPPORTED RESEARCH, OUR COLLABORATIVE TEAM DEVELOPED A HIGH-PERFORMANCE INTRACORTICAL BRAIN- COMPUTER INTERFACE (IBCI) THAT DECODES ARM MOVEMENT INTENTIONS DIRECTLY FROM BRAIN ACTIVITY.

THIS WORK WILL BUILD UPON DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN STUDYING THE MOTOR SYSTEM IN HUMANS AND NON-HUMAN PRIMATES, WITH THE END GOAL OF ADVANCING IBCI TECHNOLOGY, AND WILL BE PERFORMED AS PART OF THE MULTI-SITE BRAINGATE CONSORTIUM.

TO COMPLEMENT THESE POWERFUL GENETIC TOOLS, IT WILL BE EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE NEW IMAGING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN REVEAL HOW MULTIPLE NEURON- TYPES WORK TOGETHER IN THE LIVE BRAIN TO SUPPORT INFORMATION-PROCESSING AND CONSTRUCT DIFFERENT BRAIN STATES.  TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND THE JOHN B. PIERCE LABORATORY AT YALE UNIVERSITY WILL CREATE OPTICAL TECHNIQUES FOR IMAGING THE CONCURRENT VOLTAGE DYNAMICS OF UP TO 4 SEPARATE NEURON-TYPES IN BEHAVING ANIMALS. FIRST, WE WILL COMBINE MACHINE LEARNING METHODS AND AN AUTOMATED, HIGH-THROUGHPUT PROTEIN SCREENING PLATFORM TO ENGINEER 4 DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF GENETICALLY ENCODED FLUORESCENT OPTICAL INDICATORS OF NEURONAL TRANSMEMBRANE VOLTAGE. WE WILL THEN INNOVATE SEVERAL TYPES OF OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS TAILORED TO WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NEW VOLTAGE INDICATORS. THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL ENABLE UNPRECEDENTED STUDIES OF VOLTAGE RHYTHMS AND SPIKING DYNAMICS IN 2\u20134 GENETICALLY IDENTIFIED NEURON-TYPES IN SUPERFICIAL AND DEEP BRAIN AREAS OF AWAKE BEHAVING ANIMALS. ONE INSTRUMENT WILL ALLOW US TO TRACK THE CONCURRENT, POPULATION VOLTAGE OSCILLATIONS OF 2 NEURON-TYPES IN FREELY BEHAVING RODENTS. ANOTHER INSTRUMENT, AN OPTICAL MESOSCOPE, WILL ENABLE IMAGING STUDIES OF VOLTAGE WAVES AND OSCILLATIONS ACROSS THE ENTIRE NEOCORTICAL SURFACE OF BEHAVING MICE.

AND DYNAMICS OF THE INSULAR CORTEX UNDERLYING MOTIVATIONAL BEHAVIORS - PROJECT SUMMARY THE INSULAR CORTEX (IC) IS A MULTIMODAL HUB THAT INTEGRATES INTEROCEPTIVE AND EXTEROCEPTIVE INFORMATION TO CONTROL DIVERSE ASPECTS OF ANIMAL BEHAVIORS RELATED TO COGNITION, EMOTION, AND MOTIVATION. AMONG OTHER FUNCTIONS, THE IC RECEIVES INFORMATION REGARDING AN ANIMAL\u2019S METABOLIC STATES AND DRIVES MOTIVATION AND VALENCE-SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS. HOWEVER, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEURONAL SUBSTRATES AND CIRCUIT PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING IC FUNCTION IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY. AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IS TO DETERMINE THE ACTIVITIES OF INDIVIDUAL NEURONS WITHIN DISCRETE IC CIRCUITS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER AN ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, A PREREQUISITE IS TO DELINEATE THE EVENTS IN INDIVIDUAL IC NEURONAL TYPES THAT GIVE RISE TO THE DIVERSE FUNCTIONS IN MOTIVATED BEHAVIORS. HOWEVER, TWO MAJOR CHALLENGES EXIST. FIRST, NEURONAL CIRCUITS ARE ORGANIZED AROUND SUBREGIONS AND NEURONAL TYPES. IT IS INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT TRADITIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF IC SUBREGIONS AND CELL TYPES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN THE FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF THE IC. PRECISE CLASSIFICATION OF SUBREGIONS, NEURONAL TYPES, AND NEURON-SPECIFIC CONNECTIVITY IS NEEDED. SECOND, AN ANIMAL\u2019S INTERNAL STATE IS IN PART ENCODED BY NEUROMODULATORS, SUCH AS DOPAMINE, WHICH DYNAMICALLY MODULATE THE FUNCTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL IC CIRCUITS. DESPITE RECENT PROGRESS IN MEASURING EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE AND OTHER NEUROMODULATORS, THEY TRIGGER INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING EVENTS IN A CELL TYPE-SPECIFIC MANNER. HEREIN, WE PROPOSE TO OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS BY INTEGRATING THE LATEST COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES FROM THE THREE PIS. FIRST, WE WILL USE MACHINE LEARNING-BASED ALGORITHMS TO COMPREHENSIVELY IDENTIFY FUNCTIONAL SUBDIVISIONS, NEURONAL TYPES, AND CELL-SPECIFIC CONNECTIVITY IN THE IC. SECOND, WE WILL LINK THE ACTIVITIES OF INDIVIDUAL IC CELL TYPES AND SUBREGIONS TO ANIMAL VIGOR OR VALENCE USING TWO-PHOTON CALCIUM IMAGING THROUGH A GRADIENT-INDEX (GRIN) LENS.

THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE VARIOUS AUDITORY CORTICAL AND THALAMIC PATHWAYS TO THE STRIATUM ALL PLAY DISTINCT ROLES DURING LEARNING AND EXECUTION OF SOUND-DRIVEN DECISIONS. THIS WORK WILL CONSIST OF DEVELOPING THEORETICAL MODELS OF SOUND REPRESENTATION AND LEARNING IN THE MULTIPLE AUDITORY PATHWAYS CONVERGING ON THE STRIATUM, AS WELL AS CARRYING OUT EXPERIMENTS IN MICE TRAINED TO PERFORM ACOUSTIC DISCRIMINATION TASKS IN ORDER TO TEST AND REFINE THESE MODELS. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NOVEL TECHNIQUES FOR REVERSIBLE MANIPULATION OF SPECIFIC NEURAL PATHWAYS WHILE MONITORING LARGE NUMBERS OF NEURONS SIMULTANEOUSLY DURING BEHAVIOR. THE PROJECT IS ORGANIZED IN THREE AIMS. THE FIRST AIM IS TO DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH AUDITORY CORTICO-STRIATAL AND THALAMO-STRIATAL PATHWAYS PLAY DISTINCT ROLES DURING PERFORMANCE OF SOUND-ACTION ASSOCIATION TASKS. THE SECOND AIM IS TO DETERMINE THE ROLES OF AUDITORY CORTICAL VS. THALAMIC PATHWAYS TO THE STRIATUM DURING LEARNING OF THESE TASKS. THE THIRD AIM IS TO IDENTIFY THE ACOUSTIC FEATURES OF NATURAL SOUNDS CONVEYED BY DISTINCT AUDITORY CORTICAL FIELDS TO THE STRIATUM.

HOW PREMOTOR NETWORKS ARE STRUCTURED TO CONTROL MOTOR OUTPUT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD, DUE IN PART TO AN INCOMPLETE INVENTORY OF SPINAL CELL TYPES, AND TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF RECORDING NEURAL ACTIVITY IN BEHAVING ANIMALS. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO USE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER AS A MODEL FOR INVESTIGATING MOTOR CONTROL AND PREMOTOR NEURAL CIRCUITS. WITH AN ACCESSIBLE AND NUMERICALLY COMPACT NERVOUS SYSTEM, A LARGE AND GROWING SUITE OF GENETIC TOOLS, AND AGILE, LIMBED LOCOMOTION, DROSOPHILA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF MOTOR CONTROL. WE INTRODUCE A TASK IN WHICH FLIES LEARN TO GENERATE SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF FORCE TO POSITION THE FEMUR-TIBIA JOINT IN DIFFERENT TARGETS. THE JOINT IS CONTROLLED BY TWELVE NEURONS WHICH CAN BE GENETICALLY LABELED FOR TARGETED NEURAL RECORDINGS. ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS WILL REVEAL HOW THE COMPLETE POPULATION OF MOTOR NEURONS FUNCTION TOGETHER TO DYNAMICALLY POSITION THE LEG AND TO SUSTAIN A GIVEN FORCE OUTPUT. THESE DATA WILL ADDRESS LONG-STANDING HYPOTHESES ABOUT HOW PREMOTOR CIRCUITS RECRUIT SUBSETS OF MOTOR NEURONS AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH THAT CONTROL IS FLEXIBLE. THEN, A NEW ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY LEVEL RECONSTRUCTION OF CENTRAL LOCOMOTOR CIRCUITS WILL ALLOW IDENTIFICATION OF KEY PREMOTOR NEURONS. ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS OF THOSE PREMOTOR NEURONS DURING THE BEHAVIORAL TASK WILL REVEAL THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO PROCESSING SENSORY FEEDBACK AND TO CONTROLLING LEG FORCE. THESE RESULTS WILL PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW DESCENDING COMMANDS INTERACT WITH INTERNAL MODELS OF BODY STATE TO CONTROL LOCOMOTION, A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING THE LONG-TERM GOALS OF DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS FOR NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS AND ALGORITHMS FOR CONTROLLING ENGINEERED SYSTEMS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8a022699-f7be-356a-f01a-3aa6f76016ef-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_RF1NS128785_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151143417, "Award ID": "RF1NS128772", "Award Amount": 3176798.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-16", "CFDA Number": "93.865", "Description": "MESOSCALE BIDIRECTIONAL TWO-PHOTON HOLOGRAPHIC OPTOGENETICS - PROJECT SUMMARY ACHIEVING A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEURAL CODES OF SENSATION, ACTION, AND COGNITION REQUIRES TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN CAUSALLY PERTURB EACH OF THE MAJOR DIMENSIONS OF POPULATION CODING ONE AT A TIME WITH EXTREMELY HIGH PRECISION ACROSS MULTIPLE BRAIN AREAS.

AS A CONSEQUENCE, A LARGE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS DO NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE TREATMENT.  TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NON-INVASIVE APPROACH AND HARDWARE THAT ENABLE NONINVASIVE AND TARGETED NEUROMODULATION. THE TOOL MODULATES SPECIC BRAIN TARGETS ON COMMAND AND AT HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. THE APPROACH HAS THE PRECISION OF IMPLANTED ELECTRODES BUT IS APPLIED REMOTELY AND ENTIRELY NONINVASIVELY. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE APPROACH COMBINES TWO FORMS OF NONINVASIVE ENERGIES\u2014FOCUSED ULTRASONIC AND MAGNETIC ELDS.

A VERSATILE APPROACH FOR IN VIVO MONITORING OF BRAIN CHEMISTRY IS TO COUPLE SAMPLING METHODS, SUCH AS MICRODIALYSIS, TO ANALYTICAL MEASUREMENTS. PRIMARY ADVANTAGES OF THE SAMPLING METHODS RELATIVE TO OTHER TOOLS, SUCH AS SENSORS, ARE THE ABILITY TO PERFORM CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENTS OVER TIME, MEASURE A WIDE VARIETY OF CHEMICALS, AND POTENTIAL FOR METABOLIC TRACING; HOWEVER, THESE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES ARE UNDERDEVELOPED. THE DISADVANTAGES OF THE METHOD ARE THE POOR TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION. TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IS LIMITED BY THE TIME REQUIRED TO COLLECT ENOUGH SAMPLES FOR ANALYSIS WHILE SPATIAL RESOLUTION IS LIMITED BY THE PROBE SIZE. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS. FURTHER, THE STRENGTHS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND THE UNIQUE CAPABILITIES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE BRAIN INITIATIVE.

HOWEVER, CALCIUM IMAGING CONVEYS ONLY LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT NATURAL SIGNAL PROCESSING IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND IT PROVIDES LITTLE OR NO DATA ON THE INHIBITORY AND EXCITATORY SIGNALS THAT OCCUR CONTINUOUSLY IN MOST NEURONS. IN CONTRAST, VOLTAGE IMAGING ALLOWS A DIRECT MEASURE OF NEURONAL ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY, AND IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS INHERENT TO CALCIUM IMAGING.

OPTICAL IMAGING OF NEURONAL ACTION POTENTIALS IS CHALLENGING AS IT REQUIRES A MILLISECOND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. THIS REQUIREMENT BECOMES MORE DEMANDING IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) IMAGING, WHERE MOST OPTICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES RELY ON SCANNING TO ACQUIRE VOLUMETRIC DATA, EITHER POINTWISE LIKE CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY OR PLANES LIKE LIGHT-SHEET MICROSCOPY.

IN CONTRAST, LIGHT FIELD IMAGING CAPTURES THE VOLUMETRIC DATA SIMULTANEOUSLY, MAKING IT AN IDEAL STRATEGY FOR 3D IMAGING OF NEURONAL NETWORKS. NONETHELESS, BECAUSE LIGHT FIELD IMAGING RECORDS BOTH THE SPATIAL AND ANGULAR INFORMATION OF LIGHT RAYS, IT TYPICALLY REQUIRES A LARGE-FORMAT IMAGE SENSOR, WHICH HAS A LOW FRAME RATE DUE TO LIMITED ELECTRONIC BANDWIDTH.

A CRITICAL CHALLENGE OF DELIVERING LIGHT IN THE BRAIN FOR IN VIVO OPTOGENETICS ARISES FROM THE POOR PENETRATION OF PHOTONS IN BIOLOGICAL TISSUE DUE TO THE SCATTERING AND ABSORPTION OF LIGHT. AS A RESULT, IN VIVO OPTOGENETIC STIMULATION IN THE DEEP BRAIN USUALLY REQUIRES INVASIVE PROCEDURES, SUCH AS CRANIOTOMY AND INTRACRANIAL IMPLANTATION OF OPTICAL FIBERS. THE VERY INVASIVENESS OF THESE PROCEDURES ALSO PRECLUDES EASY REPOSITIONING AND VOLUME ADJUSTMENT OF THE ILLUMINATED REGION IN THE SAME SUBJECT. SEVERAL STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES ABOVE. RED-SHIFTED AND ULTRASENSITIVE OPSINS ENABLE TRANSCRANIAL OPTOGENETICS, YET LIGHT MUST TRAVEL THROUGH ALL SUPERFICIAL BRAIN TISSUES WITH SIGNIFICANT POWER ATTENUATION, HEATING TO OTHER BRAIN STRUCTURES, POTENTIAL OFF-TARGET EFFECTS, AND AN INABILITY TO REPOSITION THE MANIPULATED BRAIN REGIONS.

CENTRAL TO THIS METHOD IS MECHANOLUMINESCENT NANOPARTICLES (MLNPS), WHICH CAN BE DELIVERED INTRAVENOUSLY, CHARGED BY 400-NM LIGHT WHEN PASSING THROUGH SUPERFICIAL VESSELS, PUMPED BY THE HEART INTO CEREBRAL VESSELS, AND THEN GATED BY FUS TO EMIT 470-NM LIGHT LOCALLY FOR OPSIN ACTIVATION, ALL WITHOUT EXITING THE BLOOD CIRCULATION.

WE WILL TEST THE PREDICTIONS OF MULTIPLE COMPUTATIONAL MODELLING AND INDIRECT EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES. ONE OF THESE THAT ECS PREFERENTIALLY ACTIVATES CELLS IN SUPERFICIAL CORTICAL LAYERS WITH BROAD PROJECTIONS, COULD HELP EXPLAIN HOW FOCAL STIMULATION CAUSES WIDESPREAD EFFECTS.

HOWEVER, 2D CELL CULTURES AND ANIMALS DO NOT ACCURATELY RECAPITULATE THE COMPLEXITY AND UNIQUE FEATURES OF HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY, THUS BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY FROM THEIR IN VIVO AND HUMAN COUNTERPARTS IN MANY KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF CELLULAR BEHAVIOR, LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY MODEL BRAIN DISEASES. THANKS TO ADVANCEMENTS IN HUMAN INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL (HIPSC) TECHNOLOGY, COMPLEX STRUCTURES RESEMBLING DEVELOPING ORGANS, NAMED ORGANOIDS, HAVE BEEN GENERATED FOR MANY TYPES OF ORGANS, INCLUDING BRAIN ORGANOIDS. THESE HUMAN ORGANOIDS REPLICATE CRITICAL ORGAN AND TISSUE-SPECIFIC FEATURES NOT OBSERVED IN ANIMAL MODELS OR 2D CELL CULTURES, THUS PROVIDING A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO MODEL HUMAN ORGAN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION UNDER HEALTHY AND DISEASE CONDITIONS. A MAJOR LIMITATION FOR BRAIN ORGANOID RESEARCH IS THE LACK OF ADEQUATE INSTRUMENTATION TO MONITOR SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ORGANIZATION OF NEURAL NETWORKS. SPECIFICALLY, ORGANOIDS ARE SPHERICAL WHEREAS COMMERCIAL MICROELECTRODE ARRAYS (MEAS) ARE FLAT, WHICH REDUCES THE ACCURACY TO DETERMINE NEURAL NETWORK ORGANIZATION BECAUSE THE CELLULAR SURFACE AREA FOR RECORDING NEURAL SIGNALS IS LIMITED AND ORGANOIDS REMODEL ON FLAT SURFACES. TO ENHANCE THE VALUE OF BRAIN ORGANOIDS FOR PRECLINICAL RESEARCH AND DISEASE MODELING, AN MEA TECHNOLOGY IS NEEDED THAT ENABLES MONITORING OF NEURAL SIGNALS ACROSS AS MUCH OF THE SURFACE OF THE PHYSIOLOGICALLY INTACT ORGANOID AS POSSIBLE. NO SUCH COMMERCIAL PLATFORM CURRENTLY EXISTS. THIS APPLICATION AIMS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY UTILIZING BMSEED\u2019S STRETCHABLE MICROELECTRODES TO CREATE POCKETS OF VARIABLE SIZES TO CONTAIN THE ORGANOID, RETAIN ITS SHAPE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION, AND ENVELOPE IT WITH MICROELECTRODES FOR RECORDING OF NEURAL ACTIVITY ACROSS ITS SURFACE.

SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROPOSAL HAS THREE AIMS. THE FIRST SPECIFIC AIM IS FOCUSED ON BUILDING THE OBSURVE PLATFORM, AND TO ADAPT THE CONFORMEAS TO MEET THE NEED FOR ORGANOIDS RESEARCH. THE SECOND SPECIFIC AIM IS THE EVALUATION OF THE ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE PLATFORM. THE THIRD SPECIFIC AIM IS THE VALIDATION OF THE OBSURVE PLATFORM FOR DRUG SCREENING AND DISEASE MODELING USING BRAIN ORGANOIDS. THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE HUMAN BRAIN ORGANOIDS BECAUSE NEUROLOGICAL AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, SUCH AS AUTISM, ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE, AND PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE, ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT AND COSTLY HEALTH PROBLEMS FACING OUR SOCIETY.

THE GROUNDBREAKING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE OF EXM, WHICH WAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED BY DR. EDWARD S. BOYDEN (DEPT. BIOL. ENGIN., MEDIA LAB AND DEPT. BRAIN COGNIT. SCI., MIT, CAMBRIDGE, MA) AND COLLEAGUES, IS THE ABILITY TO ISOTROPICALLY EXPAND TISSUE AND INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE BIOLOGICAL STRUCTURES. THIS ALLOWS NANOSCALE-RESOLUTION, LIGHT-MICROSCOPIC IMAGING OF SMALL OBJECTS THAT ARE TOO SMALL TO BE RESOLVED WITHOUT EXPANSION DUE TO THE DIFFRACTION LIMIT OF LIGHT. AMONG OTHER BENEFITS, EXM ALLOWS THOSE SMALL STRUCTURES TO BE IMAGED WITH A WIDER RANGE OF MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES. PROCESSING TISSUE FOR EXM ALSO ALLOWS REPEATED HYBRIDIZATION (FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF MRNAS) AND/OR REPEATED ANTIBODY STAINING (FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF PROTEINS) OF THE SAME TISSUE, COMBINED WITH REPEATED MICROSCOPIC IMAGING ROUNDS. EACH ROUND YIELDS ADJACENT, HIGH-MAGNIFICATION, SINGLE FIELD-OF-VIEW IMAGE STACKS, CONSISTING OF AT LEAST ONE MORPHOLOGY REFERENCE CHANNEL SHOWING NEURONAL SUB-CELLULAR STRUCTURES (SOMAS, AXONS, DENDRITES, DENDRITIC SPINES, SYNAPSES) AS WELL AS ONE OR SEVERAL INFO CHANNELS SHOWING MRNAS AND/OR PROTEINS. COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATIONS OF MRNAS AND PROTEINS IN NEURONS IN SITU REQUIRES ASSEMBLING THE IMAGE STACKS OF ALL PERFORMED ROUNDS INTO A SINGLE, SEAMLESS AND ALIGNED, THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) EXM IMAGE, WHICH IS HIGH-DIMENSIONAL AND CAN BE SEVERAL TERABYTES IN SIZE. HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTS A NUMBER OF COMPUTATIONAL CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO MICROSCOPY IMAGE REGISTRATION, SEGMENTATION AND ANALYSIS. THE GAME-CHANGING INNOVATION IN NEUROEXM IS THE ABILITY TO PERFORM ALL OF THESE TASKS WITHOUT THE NEED TO HAVE A COMPUTER SCIENTIST ON STAFF TO RUN THE EXISTING, INDIVIDUAL LAB-BASED SOFTWARE SCRIPTS DEVELOPED FOR EACH STEP OF THIS KIND OF COMPLEX ANALYSIS.

BASED ON PILOT WORK PERFORMED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE BOYDEN LAB DURING PREPARATION OF THIS PROPOSAL, WE ARE CONVINCED THAT NEUROEXM WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIELD OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH. SPECIFICALLY, THE COMBINATION OF EXM AND NEUROEXM WILL ENABLE SUBSTANTIAL ADVANCEMENTS IN RESEARCH STUDIES FOCUSING ON ALTERATIONS IN THE SPATIAL TRANSCRIPTOME AND PROTEOME OF NEURONS ASSOCIATED WITH NEURODEVELOPMENTAL, NEUROPSYCHIATRIC, NEURODEGENERATIVE AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AS WELL AS IN AGING RESEARCH AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT. ULTIMATELY, THIS WILL RESULT IN AN IMPROVED BASIS FOR DEVELOPING NOVEL TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR A WIDE SPECTRUM OF COMPLEX BRAIN DISEASES. IN PHASE I WE WILL DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF THIS NOVEL TECHNOLOGY BY DEVELOPING PROTOTYPE SOFTWARE; WORK IN PHASE II WILL FOCUS ON CREATING THE FULL FUNCTIONALITY OF NEUROEXM FOR COMMERCIAL RELEASE.

THE POTENTIAL FOR FLUORESCENT VOLTAGE SENSORS TO REVOLUTIONIZE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF DENDRITIC INTEGRATION IN CORTICAL CIRCUITS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR DECADES.

TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE A NEW MODEL, DANIONELLA DRACULA, A GENETICALLY TRACTABLE MINIATURE SPECIES OF FISH THAT IS TRANSPARENT INTO ADULTHOOD, PRODUCES ROBUST SONIC AND VISUAL (POSTURAL) SIGNALS SOLELY IN AGGRESSIVE CONTEXTS, AND A CLOSE RELATIVE OF ZEBRAFISH (DANIO RERIO), WHICH ARE NOT SONIC. GENETIC TOOLKITS DEVELOPED IN ZEBRAFISH ARE READILY ADAPTED IN D. DRACULA. OUR LONG- TERM GOAL IS TO USE THIS NEW MODEL TO TEST IF AN EVOLUTIONARILY CONSERVED FOREBRAIN NETWORK OF NEURONAL POPULATIONS IS ACTIVATED DURING AGGRESSION, SENSITIVE TO ACOUSTIC SIGNALS, AND, USING OPTOGENETIC APPROACHES, CAN BE MANIPULATED AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL TO EFFECT AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. TO REACH THIS GOAL, WE PROPOSE IN AIM 1 TO MAP A FOREBRAIN AGGRESSION NETWORK IN D. DRACULA AND USE CUTTING-EDGE METHODS FOR BRAIN-WIDE 2 AND 3- PHOTON CALCIUM IMAGING OF AUDITORY-RESPONSIVE NEURONS TO IDENTIFY FOREBRAIN REGIONS INVOLVED SPECIFICALLY IN ACOUSTIC-RELATED AGGRESSION. AIM 2\u2019S GOAL IS TO MAP PROJECTIONS AND GAIN GENETIC ACCESS TO A BRAIN REGION IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 FOR IDENTIFYING CONNECTIVITY AND CAUSAL TESTING OF A ROLE FOR THIS REGION IN AGGRESSION AND ON ACTIVITY ACROSS THE AGGRESSION NETWORK. TO THIS END, WE WILL GENERATE A TRANSGENIC LINE WITH GCAMP AND PHOTOACTIVATABLE GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (PAGFP), THAT WILL ALLOW VISUALIZATION OF PROJECTIONS IN FUNCTIONALLY CHARACTERIZED NEURONS, UNCOVERING ANATOMICAL PATHWAYS BETWEEN AUDITORY NEURONS WITHIN AGGRESSION CIRCUITS. USING A PROMOTER CHARACTERIZED IN ZEBRAFISH GAL4 LINES WE WILL CREATE A TRANSGENIC D. DRACULA LINE EXPRESSING AN OPSIN IN A POPULATION OF EXCITATORY NEURONS IN AN AUDITORY-SENSITIVE REGION AND DETERMINE THEIR CONNECTIVITY TO OTHER CANDIDATE BRAIN AREAS INVOLVED IN AGGRESSION. COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TRANSGENIC LINES AND METHODS TO ESTABLISH D. DRACULA AS A NEW VERTEBRATE MODEL FOR NEURAL CIRCUITS OF AGGRESSION.

OUR APPROACH IS TO DISSECT BASIC SENSORIMOTOR TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE ZEBRAFISH, WHICH WE BELIEVE PLAY A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN EXPLAINING EMERGING SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO SIMPLE AND WELL DESCRIBED REFLEXIVE BEHAVIORS: 1) THE OPTOMOTOR REFLEX (OMR), WHERE FISH SWIM ALONG WITH WHOLE FIELD MOTION STIMULI AND 2) OBJECT EVOKED RE-ORIENTING RESPONSES (OER) WHERE FISH TURN AWAY OR TOWARDS MOVING OBJECTS, DEPENDING ON THE OBJECT\u2019S SIZE AND MOVEMENT.

ONE OF OUR CENTRAL GOALS IS THE DISSECTION OF THE SPECIFIC CHANGES IN NEURAL CIRCUITRY IN THE MUTANTS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ALTERED BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPES.

NOTABLY, THESE HEATING AND COOLING RESPONSES ARE COMPUTED DE-NOVO IN THE HINDBRAIN FROM SENSORY TRIGEMINAL INPUTS. THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UNCOVER THE BIOPHYSICAL MECHANISM OF THESE COMPUTATIONS AND THEIR ROLE IN BEHAVIOR GENERATION TO GENERATE A MULTISCALE MODEL OF SENSORI-MOTOR TRANSFORMATIONS. THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS ARE GUIDED BY TESTABLE HYPOTHESES ABOUT HINDBRAIN COMPUTATION THAT ARE BASED ON OUR PREVIOUS CIRCUIT MODELING EFFORTS. SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE (1) CELLULAR MECHANISMS OF COMPUTING HEATING AND COOLING RESPONSES, (2) HOW THE CIRCUIT ANATOMY SUPPORTS THIS COMPUTATION AND (3) HOW THE RESPONSES OF HEATING AND COOLING NEURONS INFLUENCE TURNING DURING THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOR. TO THIS END EXPERIMENTS WILL COMBINE (1) PATCH ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY IN FUNCTIONALLY IDENTIFIED NEURONS, (2) SINGLE CELL LABELING THROUGH ELECTROPORATIONS AND (3) CELL TYPE SPECIFIC ABLATIONS FOLLOWED BY BEHAVIORAL RECORDINGS.

A LEADING THEORY SUGGESTS THAT PERCEPTUAL PREDICTIONS ARE ACCOMPLISHED VIA FLEXIBLE NORMALIZATION: LOCAL INHIBITORY NEURONAL POPULATIONS ARE REGULATED BY LONG-RANGE CONNECTIONS SO THAT RESPONSES ARE SUPPRESSED WHEN THEY DO NOT PROVIDE HELPFUL INFORMATION ABOUT OBJECT BOUNDARIES. HOWEVER, THE PRECISE NEURAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH THE HEALTHY HUMAN BRAIN ACCOMPLISHES THIS FLEXIBLE NORMALIZATION ARE NOT KNOWN. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW NEURAL POPULATION RESPONSES ARE SUPPRESSED OR ENHANCED IN RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT SCENE CONTEXTS, WE WILL PERFORM 2-PHOTON IMAGING IN FERRET PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX (V1) TO QUANTIFY THE RESPONSES OF EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY NEURAL POPULATIONS IN SUPERFICIAL LAYERS OF CORTEX DURING SEVERAL DIFFERENT VISUAL STIMULUS PARADIGMS. THE FERRET MODEL IS CHOSEN BECAUSE THE IMAGING TECHNIQUES NECESSARY TO QUANTIFY INHIBITORY NEURONAL RESPONSES ARE NOT YET WELL ESTABLISHED IN PRIMATE MODELS, AND WHILE OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT NEURAL MORPHOLOGY AND CONNECTIONS HAS BEEN DERIVED FROM MOUSE MODELS, MOUSE VISUAL CORTEX LACKS THE \u201cCOLUMNAR ORGANIZATION\u201d (SPATIAL GROUPING OF NEURONS WITH SIMILAR RESPONSE PROPERTIES) THAT IS A HALLMARK OF PRIMATE VISUAL CORTEX AND IS PRESENT IN FERRETS. THUS, THE FERRET MODEL IS WELL-POSITIONED TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN MOUSE MODELS AND PRIMATE MODELS.

IN THE PAST TWO DECADES, CALCIUM IMAGING IN NEURONAL CELL BODIES HAS PROVIDED A CONVENIENTLY QUALITATIVE VIEW OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY, ALLOWING ACTION POTENTIAL FIRING IN SPECIFIC NEURON TYPES OR IN VARIOUS BRAIN REGIONS TO BE CORRELATED WITH SENSORY INPUT, DECISION-MAKING, OR INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS OF EMOTIONAL OR PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, SOMATIC CALCIUM IS GENERALLY INSENSITIVE TO SUBTHRESHOLD ACTIVITY, I.E. TO SYNAPTIC INPUTS THAT DEPOLARIZE THE MEMBRANE POTENTIAL WITHOUT ELICITING ACTION POTENTIALS, AND LACKS THE TEMPORAL PRECISION TO DETERMINE THE TIMING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACTION POTENTIALS WITHIN A CIRCUIT. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BRAIN WOULD BENEIFT GREATLY FROM UNDERSTANDING HOW NEURONAL CIRCUITS USE TRANSMEMBRANE VOLTAGE TO REPRESENT AND PROCESS INFORMATION.

OPTICAL IMAGING IN AWAKE ANIMALS EXPRESSING CALCIUM OR VOLTAGE INDICATORS PROVIDES REAL-TIME FUNCTIONAL AND SPATIAL INFORMATION FROM INDIVIDUAL NEURONS WITHIN LOCAL NEURAL CIRCUITS. THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT IMAGING TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE SMALL FIELDS OF VIEW ENCOMPASSING SINGLE BRAIN REGIONS, AND THE REQUIREMENT FOR HEAD FIXATION, WHICH PREVENTS NATURALISTIC BEHAVIOR. IN ADDITION, MOST OPTICAL IMAGING SYSTEMS DO NOT ALLOW FOR SIMULTANEOUS HIGH- RESOLUTION FUNCTIONAL IMAGING IN COMBINATION WITH SPATIALLY-LOCALIZED OPTOGENETIC MODULATION. TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN OPTICAL DEVICE (`3D-FAST') THAT ALLOWS FOR RAPID, REAL- TIME VOLUMETRIC NEURAL RECORDING AND PRECISE OPTICAL STIMULATION. BY PAIRING MINIATURE ARRAYS OF MICROPATTERNED LED EMITTERS WITH THE AXIAL FOCUSING CAPABILITIES OF ELECTROWETTING LENS TECHNOLOGIES, WE WILL ACHIEVE DUPLEX RECORDING AND STIMULATION OF MANY THOUSANDS OF NEURONS.

ON THE OTHER HAND, NONINVASIVE TECHNIQUES TYPICALLY OFFER RELATIVELY LOW SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY. A MINIMALLY INVASIVE BMI WOULD BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES, OPENING A NEW AVENUE FOR NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH AND NEUROPROSTHETICS. RECENTLY, FUNCTIONAL ULTRASOUND (FUS) IMAGING WAS INTRODUCED AS A BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY FOR LARGE-SCALE RECORDING OF NEURAL ACTIVITY \u2013 PROVIDING HIGHLY SENSITIVE IMAGING OF ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT CHANGES IN BLOOD FLOW WITH A SPATIOTEMPORAL RESOLUTION OF ~100 \u039cM AND 100 MS AT SEVERAL-CM DEPTH. IMPORTANTLY, FUS CAN RECORD FROM OUTSIDE THE BRAIN AND PROTECTIVE DURA MATER TISSUE, VASTLY EXPANDING ITS POTENTIAL USE IN NEUROSCIENCE APPLICATIONS AND BMIS ALIKE.

UNDERSTANDING HOW ELECTRICAL STIMULATION AFFECTS DOPAMINE RELEASE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN DOPAMINE'S INVOLVEMENT IN LEARNING, MOTOR CONTROL, DECISION MAKING, AND NEUROPLASTICITY. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE THAT DOPAMINE'S FUNCTION IS DETERMINED BY THE TIME COURSE OF RELEASE. FOR EXAMPLE, FAST, \u201cPHASIC\u201d RELEASE (~1-2 SECONDS) IS INVOLVED IN NEUROPLASTICITY AND REWARD-GUIDED LEARNING WHILE SLOW, \u201cTONIC\u201d RELEASE (TENS OF SECONDS) IS INVOLVED IN MOTOR CONTROL AND MOTIVATION.

AS A METHOD FOR NEUROMODULATION, TCS CARRIES WITH IT MANY PRACTICAL BENEFITS: IT IS PORTABLE (BATTERY- OPERATED), INEXPENSIVE, AND EASILY DEPLOYABLE IN THE CLINIC AND AT HOME. DUE TO THIS SIMPLICITY AND APPARENT VERSATILITY THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION IN THE NUMBER OF STUDIES CURRENTLY UNDERWAY USING TRANSCRANIAL CURRENTS (OVER 500 CLINICAL TRIALS ON CLINICALTRIALS.GOV). DESPITE THIS UBIQUITY AND POTENTIAL, EVEN BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF NEURAL CHANGES INDUCED BY VARIOUS FORMS OF TCS HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED IN-VIVO. THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY HAS LED TO SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE METHOD. MOREOVER, REFINEMENT OF THE TECHNIQUE AS USED IN HUMANS IS LIMITED TO A RELATIVELY INEFFICIENT PROCESS THAT PROCEEDS LARGELY BY TRIAL AND ERROR. THIS PROJECT WILL USE STATE-OF-THE-ART IMAGING TECHNIQUES IN AWAKE MICE TO GAIN INSIGHT HOW TCS AFFECT CHANGES IN NEURAL ACTIVITY. THE PROJECT WILL USE THE EXQUISITE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF TWO-PHOTON IMAGING, TOGETHER WITH GENETIC METHODS TO TARGET SPECIFIC CELL POPULATIONS, TO REVEAL HOW TCS AFFECTS NEURAL ACTIVITY IN A CELL-TYPE, AND LAYER SPECIFIC MANNER. THIS HIGH-SPATIAL RESOLUTION TECHNIQUE WILL BE COMPLEMENTED WITH HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION VOLTAGE SENSITIVE DYE IMAGING TO ASSESS THE TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF THESE INDUCED CHANGES, INCLUDING THE ENTRAINMENT OF OSCILLATIONS. TOGETHER THESE COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT HOW TCS AFFECTS NEURAL ACTIVITY AT AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF DETAIL.

CLINICAL TRIALS OF OPTOGENETIC THERAPY FOR RETINAL DISEASES ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY. SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THESE CURRENT TOOLS INCLUDE A GENERALLY SMALL LIGHT-INDUCED CURRENT, THEIR LIMITED ABILITY TO MANIPULATE SPECIFIC CELL ACTIVITY IN DEEP TISSUE, THE NEED FOR ROBUST TRANSGENE EXPRESSION TO ILLICIT PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS, AND SAFETY CONCERNS OVER LONG-TERM EXOGENOUS TRANSGENE EXPRESSION. THE NOVEL CHEMO-OPTOGENETIC TOOLS I DEVELOP WILL ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES. I PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED A NOVEL CHEMO-OPTOGENETIC TOOL BASED ON THE HIGH CONDUCTANCE TRPA1 CHANNEL WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR MODULATING BOTH NEURONAL AND NON-NEURONAL CELL ACTIVITY IN VIVO. I HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AND PERFORMED A SMALL MOLECULE SCREEN BASED ON THE ZEBRAFISH LIGHT-INDUCED MOTION RESPONSE AND DISCOVERED MOLECULAR PHOTOSWITCHES THAT TARGET ENDOGENOUS VERTEBRATE PROTEINS. I AM CHARACTERIZING TWO HITS IDENTIFIED FROM THIS SCREEN (AIM 1, K99 PHASE). ONE IS A STEP-FUNCTION CHEMO- OPTOGENETIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE TRPA1 CHANNEL. THIS NEW SYSTEM WILL ALLOW FOR LIGHT-CONTROLLED CHANNEL ON/OFF, FURTHER ENHANCING TRPA1 UTILITY. THE SECOND IS A CHEMO-OPTOGENETIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE TRPV1 CHANNEL. THE NEXT PHASE OF MY CHEMO-OPTOGENETIC TOOL-DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IS TO ENHANCE TRPA1 CHANNEL SELECTIVITY FOR SODIUM WHILE PRESERVING ITS HIGH CHANNEL CONDUCTANCE (AIM 2, K99/R00 PHASE). THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT LIGHT-INDUCED GENERATION OF ACTION POTENTIALS. I WILL ALSO EXTEND THE ZEBRAFISH LIGHT-INDUCED MOTION RESPONSE SCREENING ASSAY TO SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY ENDOGENOUS PROTEIN-TARGETING MOLECULAR PHOTOSWITCHES WITH SPECTRA IN THE NEAR INFRARED RANGE (AIM 3, R00 PHASE). THE USE OF NEAR INFRARED LIGHT ALLOWS FOR DEEPER PENETRATION INTO TISSUES AND FOR COMPATIBILITY WITH EXISTING OPTOGENETIC TOOLS AND BIOSENSOR IMAGING.

MUCH WORK ON THIS SUBJECT HAS FOCUSED ON THE DYNAMICS OF HETEROGENEOUS POPULATIONS OF NEURONS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE MOTOR SYSTEM. HOWEVER, WHETHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF NEURONS ARE RECRUITED OVER LEARNING AND/OR WHETHER NEURONS CHANGE FUNCTIONALLY OVER LEARNING HAS NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY EXPLORED. ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS IS A KEY STEP IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE MOTOR CIRCUIT EVOLVES OVER LEARNING TO ALLOW FOR INCREASED MOTOR PROFICIENCY. THEREFORE, MY LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO FOCUS ON (1) CELL TYPE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS AND (2) CELL TYPE INTRINSIC CHANGES DURING MOTOR LEARNING. THIS WILL HELP INSTRUCT OUR THINKING ABOUT MOTOR DISEASES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH MOTOR LEARNING DEFICITS LIKE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. IN THIS PROPOSAL, I BEGIN BY EXAMINING THE FIRST AREA - THE CELLULAR DETERMINANTS OF MOTOR LEARNING. BY FOCUSING ON THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, A CENTRAL COORDINATOR OF THE MOTOR SYSTEM AND A REGION NECESSARY FOR MOTOR SKILL LEARNING, I BEGIN BY ASKING WHETHER DIFFERENT CELL TYPES ARE ENRICHED OVER MOTOR LEARNING, A STUDY IN LINE WITH THE FIRST AIM OF THE BRAIN 2025 REPORT.

THESE CELLS PROJECT TO THE MOTOR THALAMUS, ANOTHER REGION STRONGLY IMPLICATED IN MOTOR LEARNING, MAKING THEM AN INTERESTING CANDIDATE FOR FURTHER STUDY. I MAP THE BRAIN-WIDE PROJECTION PATTERN OF THESE CELLS, EXAMINE THEIR DYNAMICS AND ENGAGEMENT OVER LEARNING, AND PERTURB THEIR ACTIVITY. FINALLY, IN AIM 3, IN THE INDEPENDENT PHASE (R00), I CONTINUE TO ADDRESS BOTH QUESTIONS OF CELL TYPE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTION AND CELL INTRINSIC CHANGES BUT AT A BRAIN-WIDE LEVEL.

HERE I WILL CHARACTERIZE HOW ADO AND DA RELEASE IN THE BG ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER, TO MOTOR VARIABILITY, AND TO THE LEARNING OF VOCAL MOTOR SEQUENCES. IN DIRECT SERVICE OF BRAIN INITIATIVE GOALS, I WILL COMBINE CUTTING-EDGE COMPUTATIONAL AND OPTICAL TOOLS ALONG WITH AN INNOVATIVE MOLECULAR-GENETIC APPROACH TO DISSECT BOTH NEUROMODULATOR AND CELL- TYPE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO MOTOR VARIABILITY AND LEARNING. MY SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1) TO IMAGE ADO AND DA IN THE SBG DURING JUVENILE VOCAL LEARNING. 2) TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSITY OF SBG ADO TO REGULATE VARIABILITY AND TEST FOR A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN ADO AND DA RELEASE. 3) TO GENETICALLY TAG \u201cINDIRECT\u201d AND \u201cDIRECT\u201d SPINY NEURON TYPES AND ASSESS HOW ADO MODULATES THEIR ACTIVITY TO INFLUENCE SONG VARIABILITY. INDIVIDUALLY, EACH AIM WILL MOVE BEYOND A SINGLE-NEUROMODULATOR MODEL OF BG SKILL LEARNING, AND COLLECTIVELY THEY WILL HELP REVEAL FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL MOTOR VARIABILITY ACROSS LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE.
