THE PROCESS HAS INVOLVED SECURING COLLEGE AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT, PARTNERING WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS FOR FUNDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, PLANNING AND ESTABLISHING INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTNERING WITH LOCAL FARMERS, DETERMINING DIRECTION FOR LIVESTOCK AND CROP ACTIVITIES, PARTNERING WITH OTHER LAND GRANT INSTITUTIONS, AND SECURING QUALIFIED STAFFING TO LEAD DAY-TO-DAY FARM OPERATIONS AND PLAN FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING. TODAY BAY MILLS COMMUNITY COLLEGE&#39;S WAISHKEY BAY FARM INCLUDES 280 ACRES BEING DEVELOPED AS AN EXTENSION, TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND INCUBATOR FACILITY FOCUSING ON SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND STRENGTHENING THE LOCAL AND TRIBAL FOOD SYSTEM. CURRENT OPERATIONS INCLUDE SEASON EXTENSION CROPS WITH 2 HOOPHOUSES AND A GREENHOUSE, A COMMUNITY GARDEN, PASTURE-BASED CHICKEN PRODUCTION, AN APIARY, A SMALL APPLE ORCHARD, INDUSTRIAL HEMP VARIETY TRIALS, CULTIVATED BLUEBERRIES, AND GRASS-BASED BEEF PRODUCTION. WAISHKEY BAY FARM IS VERIFIED THROUGH THE MICHIGAN AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSURANCE PROGRAM (MAEAP). WAISHKEY BAY FARM STAFF CURRENTLY INCLUDES A FARM MANAGER, TWO FARM TECHNICIANS, AND SEASONAL YOUTH WORKERS; THE FARM IS PART OF THE BMCC LAND GRANT DEPARTMENT. IN 2012 BMCC RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM THE FIRST NATIONS DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE TO INITIATE PASTURE POULTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING EDUCATION AND DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITIES. TO DATE WAISHKEY BAY FARM&#39;S PASTURED POULTRY PRODUCTION HAS INVOLVED CHICKEN BREED PERFORMANCE RESEARCH, SUPPLEMENTAL FEED RATIO RESEARCH IN A PASTURE SYSTEM, CHICKEN PROCESSING WORKSHOPS, DONATIONS OF WHOLE PASTURE RAISED CHICKENS (PROCESSED) TO FOOD BANK AND ELDER MEAL PROGRAMS, HOSTED CHICKEN CANNING FOOD PRESERVATION WORKSHOPS, AND MADE WHOLE CHICKENS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.LIKE MUCH OF INDIAN COUNTRY AND OTHER RURAL COMMUNITIES, THROUGHOUT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY AND THE SURROUNDING AREA SAW MANY OF THE SHORTAGES AND SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES IN GROCERY STORES. DURING COVID-19 CLOSURES, STAY HOME ORDERS, AND REDUCED GATHERING POLICIES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH, BMCC SAW INCREASED INTEREST IN FOOD SOVEREIGNTY PROGRAMMING, INCLUDING OVER 250 FAMILIES RECEIVING GITIGAAN (GARDEN) KITS TO GROW THEIR OWN FOOD. IN 2021 TO BETTER SUPPORT FAMILIES ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED BY THE ONGOING COVID-19 HEALTH CONCERN, WE INCREASED CHICKEN PURCHASING OPTIONS TO INCLUDE EBT/P-EBT/SNAP FOOD ASSISTANCE BENEFITS THROUGH THE BRIMLEY BAY MILLS FARMER&#39;S MARKET.IN 2022 WE STRATEGICALLY DECIDED TO TAKE A YEAR OFF FROM PASTURED-POULTRY PRODUCTION SO THAT FARM STAFF COULD PRIORITIZE A NUMBER OF LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.THIS HAS ALSO GIVEN OUR TEAM TIME TO BETTER UNDERSTAND EMERGING BEST PRACTICES TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE AVIAN FLU VIRUS PRESENT IN THE STATE OF MICHIG,AN IN BOTH WATER FOUL (PLENTIFUL IN OUR COMMUNITY) AND DOMESTICATED POULTRY. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY MISS THE PASTURED POULTRY PROGRAM AND THE HEALTHY FOOD ACCESS IT PROVIDED. AT THE SAME TIME, SOME OF OUR 2022 INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS INCLUDING A FREEZER ROOM WITH FOOD ESTABLISHMENT INSPECTION AND PERMITTING, HAVE CREATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN SELLING OUR USDA PROCESSED BEEF TO THE BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY OWNED RURAL GROCERY STORE, FOUR SEASONS MARKET AND DELI. THIS INVOLVED GROWING OUR WAISHKEY BAY FARM TEAM&#39;S KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR NAVIGATING A MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING FARM PROCESSING AND SALES OUTLETS. THIS EXPERIENCE, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND FOOD SAFETY POLICY UNDERSTANDING GIVES OUR TEAM A STRONG BASIS TO BUILD EXPANDED POULTRY PROCESSING CAPACITY, INCLUDING INSTITUTIONAL SALES TO TRIBAL MEAL PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITY, RESTAURANTS AND GROCERY STORES, IN ADDITION TO DIRECT TO CONSUMER SALES.ADDITIONALLY, OUR FARM TEAM HAS SUPPORTED PAST WORK LED BY OUR KEY COLLABORATOR AT BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER IN DEVELOPING THE JIIBAAKWAAN PRODUCTION ORDINANCE. JIIBAAKWAAN IS THE ORIGINAL WORD THAT IS USED TO REFERENCE FOOD THAT IS COOKED, BOILED, OR CANNED IN THE ANISHINAABE LANGUAGE. THE PURPOSE OF THE JIIBAAKWAAN PRODUCTION ORDINANCE IS TO ESTABLISH REGULATIONS FOR COTTAGE FOODS PRODUCED OR SOLD WITHIN BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY AT THE BAY MILLS FARMER&#39;S MARKET, WITH THE GOAL TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE SPIRIT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP WHILE MANAGING FOOD SAFETY AND FOODS OF CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE THAT ARE PRODUCED OR PREPARED IN A TRADITIONALLY SAFE MANNER. THIS PAST POLICY WORK LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR DEVELOPING REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS AROUND POULTRY PROCESSING ON SOVEREIGN LANDS.THE CONGRESSIONAL AMENDMENT PUBLIC LAW (P.L.) 90-492 AMENDED THE POULTRY PRODUCTS INSPECTION ACT TO PROVIDE COOPERATION WITH APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCY POULTRY PRODUCTS INSPECTION PROGRAMS. THIS PUBLIC LAW PAVEDTHE WAY FOR MANY STATES TO DEVELOP LAWS AND PROCEDURES FOR SMALL-SCALE PRODUCERS TO OPERATE UNDER THESE EXEMPTIONS WHEN SELLING THEIR RAW POULTRY PRODUCTS WITHIN THE STATE. MICHIGAN IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT HAS OPTED INTO SUCH A STATE POULTRY PROCESSING PROGRAM. THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT (MDARD) AND BAY MILLS COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENJOY A POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM THEIR STATE LEVEL REGULATIONS AND INSPECTION PROCESS TO DEVELOP PARALLEL PROCEDURES THAT WOULD GOVERN POULTRY PROCESSING ON SOVEREIGN TRIBAL LANDS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY. THIS TRIBAL SPECIFIC POULTRY PROCESSING EXEMPTION HAS POTENTIAL VALUE TO OTHER TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND IN YEARS THREE THROUGH FIVE WAISHKEY BAY FARM STAFF WOULD WORK TO DEVELOP A KNOWLEDGE PRODUCT TO MAKE OUR FUTURE ORDINANCE AND PROCESS INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO OTHER TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND FOOD SOVEREIGNTY OR AGRI,CULTURAL DEPARTMENTS. THIS KNOWLEDGE PRODUCT WILL BE DEVELOPED AS A WEBINAR WITH RECORDING OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY VISUALIZATIONS (TO BE DETERMINED). OUR KEY COLLABORATOR, CONNIE WATSON, AT BAY MILLS HEALTH CENTER HAS A CURRENT BUDGET AND AGREEMENT WITH MITCHELL HAMLINE PUBLIC LAW SCHOOL IN ST. PAUL MINNESOTA FOR 2022-2024 FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (INCLUDING LEGAL GUIDANCE) TO FURTHER SUPPORT TRIBAL FOOD AND PROCESSING REGULATION DEVELOPMENT IN REGARDS TO POULTRY PROCESSING UNDER EITHER THE

WE RECENTLY HAVE CREATED AN EARTH SYSTEMS SCIENCE AS AND ARE LOOKING AT BUILDING THIS DEGREE WITH STUDENT NUMBERS AND CLASSES. OUR FORESTRY AS IS GOING UNDER PROGRAM REVIEW AS WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN ENROLMENT WITHIN THE DEGREE DUE TO FORESTRY FACULTY TURNOVER. WE RECENTLY HAVE HIRED A FORESTRY INSTRUCTOR AND WILL BE HAVING THE FORESTRY DEGREE GOING UNDER PROGRAM REVIEW IN THE FALL OF 2018. BASED ON THE PROGRAM REVIEW WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHETHER WE CAN SUSTAIN THE PROGRAM UNDER OUR CURRENT CONDITIONS. OUR THIRD DEGREE IS A LIBERAL STEM AA THAT HAS SEEN ITS ENROLMENT INCREASE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO 18 STUDENTS. THE LIBERAL STEM AA GIVES STUDENTS MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN OUR OTHER TWO DEGREES AND IS EASIER TO RECRUIT STUDENTS INTO THE DEGREE. IN ORDER TO INCREASE OUR STEM STUDENTS AND OUR GRADUATE RATES LEECH LAKE WILL BE DOING RECRUITMENT EVENTS IN THE FALL AND SPRING THAT CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT OUR DEGREES. LEECH LAKE RECENTLY HAD TURNOVER IN OUR STEM RECRUITER POSITION BUT NOW HAS REPLACED THE PERSON AND IS SEEING POSITIVE MOVES WITH THE NEW HIRE. THIS FALL OUR NUMBERS SHOULD INCREASE AS WE ARE PLACING A CONCERTED EFFORT ON GETTING MORE STUDENTS INTERESTED IN THE STEM AREA. LEECH LAKE HAS AN ARTICULATION AGREEMENT WITH BEMIDJI STATE UNIVERSITY, LOCATED 20 MINUTES FROM OUR COLLEGE, AND THE UNIVERSITY OF DULUTH, LOCATED 100 MILES FROM OUR CAMPUS, WHERE WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH AND ARE WORKING TO GET OUR DEGREES ACCEPTED THROUGH THEIR FRONT OFFICES. LEECH LAKE IS IN NORTHERN MN AND THERE ARE NOT MANY SCHOOLS LOCATED CLOSE TO OUR CAMPUS FOR WHICH TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH. LEECH LAKE LOOKS TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE TWO SCHOOLS AS MOST OF OUR STUDENTS TRANSFER TO ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS.OUR SECOND GOAL CONCENTRATES ON IMPROVING THE STEM INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH METHODS AT OUR COLLEGE. INSTRUCTIONAL CAPACITY AT LLTC IS LIMITED BOTH BY FINDING QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS WILLING TO WORK IN A RURAL SETTING, AND THE DEMANDS ON FACULTY TIME IN A YOUNG, GROWING COLLEGE. MOST INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY HAVE LITTLE FORMAL EXPERIENCE IN WRITING CURRICULUM OR ALIGNING CURRICULUM ACROSS PROGRAM AREAS. TOPIC DRIVEN TEXTBOOKS ARE UTILIZED IN A MAJORITY OF CLASSES, INCLUDING THE SCIENCES, AND DO NOT READILY ALIGN WITH OTHER COURSES, PARTICULARLY WHEN LOOKING AT MODELS THAT INCORPORATE TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND VALUES. ALTHOUGH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR FACULTY, COVERING CLASSES WHILE AWAY, OR FINDING TIME UPON RETURN TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES IN CURRICULUM, CAN BE DIFFICULT. LEECH LAKE WILL BE WORKING AT GETTING FACULTY IMPLEMENTING AT LEAST ONE NEW INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGY IN THEIR CLASSROOM EACH YEAR AS EVIDENCE THAT THE FACULTY ARE LEARNING AND IMPLEMENTING NEW CONCEPTS INTO THE CLASSROOM. IF FACULTY DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO GO TO CONFERENCES WE ARE ENCOURAGING FACULTY TO DO ONLINE EDUCATION AS AN ALTERNATIVE, WHETHER IT BE A CLASS OR CONFERENCE. ALSO, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF FACULTY THAT ARE CONTINUING THEIR EDUCATION WITH 3 GOING FOR A MASTERS DEGREE AND 2 WORKING ON A PHD. FOR OUR ACCREDITATION FACULTY MUST HAVE 18 MASTERS CREDITS IN THE FIELD THEY ARE TEACHING SO THIS HAS PUSHED OUR FACULTY TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION AND MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CLASSES TO BE COUNTED UPON TRANSFER. WITH THE INCREASE IN COURSEWORK THAT OUR FACULTY IS UNDERTAKING LEECH LAKE WILL HAVE QUALIFIED FACULTY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO SUFFICIENTLY TEACH THE ARRAY OF STEM COURSES THAT ARE REQUIRED BY OUR DEGREES OFFERED.OUR LAST GOAL IS TO BUILD STUDENT CAPACITY WHERE STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THEIR LEARNING AND EXPAND THEIR PERCEPTION OF WHAT STEM IS. LEECH LAKE HAS USED THE NIFA GRANT IN THE PAST TO PROVIDE A STEM TUTOR IN OUR LEARNING CENTER WHERE STEM STUDENTS CAN GO AND GET EXTRA HELP. PROVIDING A TUTOR HAS LESSENED THE DEMAND ON THE STEM TEACHERS AND GIVEN THE STUDENTS ANOTHER AVENUE FROM WHICH TO GET HELP. LEECH LAKE WILL BE KEEPING TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS AND STUDENTS REACHED BY OUR TUTORING EFFORT TO SEE IF THE STUDENTS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY WE ARE PRESENTING THEM. IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE STUDENTS INTEREST LEECH LAKE IS MAKING INTERNSHIPS AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING AN INTERNSHIP EFFORT OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS WITH THE HELP OF AN NSF GRANT WHERE STUDENTS INTERNED WITH OUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. THE INTERNSHIPS ALLOWED STUDENTS A LOOK INTO STEM CAREERS THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN AND HAS WORKED OUT RATHER WELL. SOME OF THE INTERNSHIPS HAVE TURNED INTO FULL TIME JOBS ONCE THE STUDENTS COMPLETED THEIR TWO YEAR DEGREE. LEECH LAKE FEEL THAT THE INTERNSHIPS ARE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT THAT THE STUDENTS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DURING THE SUMMER IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR AREAS OF INTEREST. THE RESEARCH ASPECT HAS BEEN INCREASING AT OUR SCHOOL AS WE HAVE THREE TEACHERS DOING RESEARCH UNDER GRANTS THAT ALLOW FOR STUDENT RESEARCH TO BE INCLUDED. WITH THE RESEARCH AND INTERNSHIPS TAKING PLACE AT OUR COLLEGE THE STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN STEM RELATED ACTIVITIES AND THEN PRESENT THEIR PROJECTS AT CONFERENCES. LEECH LAKE IS WORKING ON SECURING FUNDING FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THEIR PROJECTS AT LEAST ONE CONFERENCE SO THEY GET THE EXPERIENCE OF SHARING THEIR INFORMATION.THE ULTIMATE FOCUS OF LEECH LAKE COLLEGE IS TO GET MINORITY STUDENTS, MAINLY NATIVE AMERICAN, INTO FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS AND THEN ONTO STEM CAREERS. LOOKING AT THE STATISTICS NATIVE AMERICANS IN STEM IS AROUND 1% WHICH ILLUSTRATES THE NEED FOR CONCENTRATION IN THIS AREA. AS A COLLEGE WE BELIEVE THAT QUALIFIED FACULTY AND DEGREES ALONG WITH STRONGER STEM RECRUITMENT AND STRENGTHENING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CURRICULUM AND RESEARCH WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS EXPAND CONNECTIONS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY&#39;S AND FURTHER. WHEN OUR STUDENTS LEAVE LEECH LAKE TRIBAL COLLEGE THEY WILL BE PREPARED TO ENTER THE WORKFORCE OR A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION AS WE ARE CONFIDENT THEY WILL BE PREPARED THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCE AT LEECH LAKE.OVER THE SPAN OF OUR LAST NIFA GRANT LEECH LAKE HAS SAW TURNOVER IN FACULTY AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ATTENDING OUR COLLEGE. WITH THIS, LEECH LAKE HAS BEEN ABLE TO GARNER NEW FACULTY AND IMPLEMENT THREE DEGREE PROGRAMS THAT STRENGTHEN OUR DEPARTMENT.
