OF THOSE 20, 75% ARE NON-VIOLENT PUBLIC NUISANCE CHARGES. MISDEMEANOR CHARGES IN HOWARD COUNTY TAKE APPROXIMATELY 45 TO 60 DAYS FOR A COURT DATE. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH SMI DO NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO BOND THEMSELVES OUT OF JAIL. THEREFORE, ABOUT 15 INDIVIDUALS WITH SMI AND MISDEMEANOR CHARGES ARE SITTING IN OUR COUNTY JAIL JUST WAITING FOR COURT, COSTING THE COUNTY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER MONTH. FURTHER, THE INDIVIDUALS WITH SMI HAVE AN INCREASED CHANCE OF DECOMPENSATION, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE PLACED IN SINGLE CELLS. THE DIVERSION CENTER PROPOSES TO ALLOW INTERVENTION BY JAIL DIVERTING INDIVIDUALS WITH SMI AND/OR SUD TO A MORE APPROPRIATE SETTING TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH LINKING AND COORDINATING TO RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY. OBJECTIVES INCLUDE SERVING APPROXIMATELY 150-180 INDIVIDUALS FROM HOWARD AND SURROUNDING AREAS. THE STRATEGY IS TO ALLOW FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO CONTINUALLY WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH SMI/SUD AND COMMIT PUBLIC NUISANCE CHARGES, TO HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM TO COMPLETE A QUICK DROP OFF. THEN THE TRAINED STAFF AT THE CENTER WOULD INTERVENE WITH A PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM MH/SUD NEEDS ARE.
