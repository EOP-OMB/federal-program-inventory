VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH IS HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC) IS ONE OF THE FEW CANCERS WITH INCREASING INCIDENCE IN THE US. INCIDENCE OF HCC HAS TRIPLED SINCE 1980, WHICH IS PARTICULARLY WORRISOME GIVEN THAT HCC CONFERS A MEDIAN SURVIVAL OF LESS THAN TWO YEARS. THE STEEPEST INCREASES IN INCIDENCE ARE IN SOUTHERN RURAL STATES AND AMONG ETHNIC MINORITIES. WHILE THE PREVALENCE OF HCC HAD PARALLELED HIGH RATES OF VIRAL HEPATITIS IN THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, RECENT INCREASES IN THE PREVALENCE OF NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD) AND ITS PROGRESSION TO NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS (NASH) WITH FIBROSIS AND CIRRHOSIS, HAS FUELED HCC IN RECENT YEARS. YET, THESE FACTORS ALONE DO NOT EXPLAIN THE SUBSTANTIAL REGIONAL AND ETHNIC VARIATION IN HCC PROGRESSION. ONE UNDERSTUDIED BUT POTENTIALLY POTENT HCC RISK FACTOR WITH INCREASING PREVALENCE THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS ETHNIC MINORITIES, IS EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS. THESE CONTAMINANTS DEGRADE SLOWLY AND THEREFORE PERSIST IN THE ENVIRONMENT, PROVIDING A STABLE EXOGENOUS SOURCE FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE. TOXIC METAL(OID)S SUCH AS CADMIUM AND ARSENIC ARE CLASSIFIED AS PROBABLE CARCINOGENS, AND EMERGING DATA FROM MURINE MODELS SUGGEST THAT EXPOSURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH HEPATIC STEATOSIS, CIRRHOSIS AND LIVER CANCER. PER- AND POLY-FLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFAS) EXPOSURE IN HUMANS IS ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY AND NASH. FURTHER, EMERGING EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THESE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES CAN INDUCE EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS THAT MAY PROMOTE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE LIVER, BUT WE LACK LONGITUDINAL HUMAN DATA. THESE DATA UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR LONGITUDINAL HUMAN DATA TO ASSESS WHETHER AND HOW THESE CONTAMINANTS IMPACT HCC RISK. TO ADDRESS THESE KNOWLEDGE GAPS, AND IN RESPONSE TO RFA-CA-20-049, WE PROPOSE THE SOUTHERN LIVER HEALTH STUDY, A LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY OF TWO SUB-COHORTS COMPRISING 16,000 MALES AND FEMALES AGED 40 YEARS AND OLDER IN TWO SOUTHEASTERN STATES, NORTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA. WE WILL TEST THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS THAT CADMIUM ALONE OR IN A MIXTURE WITH OTHER TOXIC METALS AND PFAS INCREASES THE RISK OF PROGRESSION FROM NAFLD TO LIVER FIBROSIS AND HCC. THE COHORT WILL BE RECRUITED FROM COMMUNITY CLINICS INCLUDING FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEMS\u2019 PRIMARY CARE CENTERS AND HEPATOLOGY PROGRAMS AT DUKE, UNC CHAPEL HILL AND EMORY. SUB-COHORT I WILL COMPRISE 10,000 OTHERWISE HEALTHY ADULTS WHO WILL BE FOLLOWED FOR 1\u20135 YEARS, ANTICIPATING THAT ~800 FIBROSIS CASES, INCLUDING CIRRHOSIS, WILL DEVELOP, AND SUB-COHORT II WILL COMPRISE 6,000 ADVANCED FIBROSIS CASES, ANTICIPATING ~750 HCC CASES WILL DEVELOP. WE WILL NEST CASE-CONTROL STUDIES WITHIN THE COHORTS, EVALUATE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND HCC INCIDENCE, AND IDENTIFY EPIGENETIC MARKS RESPONSIVE TO CONTAMINANTS THAT PREDICT PROGRESSION TO HCC. IMPACT: THIS WILL BE THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE EFFORT TO LONGITUDINALLY DETERMINE THE LINK BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS, LIVER DISEASE AND CANCER IN A RESIDENTIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION.

HEAT WAVES AND RISING TEMPERATURES HAVE MAJOR, THOUGH UNDERAPPRECIATED, HEALTH IMPLICATIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN LOW-INCOME SETTINGS. THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THE HEAT AND HEALTH AFRICAN TRANSDISCIPLINARY CENTER (HE2AT CENTER) IS TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MITIGATE THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN AFRICA. THE CONSORTIUM OF ACADEMIC AND NON-ACADEMIC PARTNERS IS DRAWN FROM ACROSS SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AND FROM THE UNITED STATES, AND CONSTITUTES A TRANSDISCIPLINARY GROUP, INCLUDING HEAT PHYSIOLOGISTS, BIOMEDICAL AND CLIMATE CONTENT EXPERTS, PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS, SOCIAL-BEHAVIORAL SCIENTISTS AS WELL AS STATISTICIANS, AND COMPUTER AND DATA SCIENTISTS. THE CENTER WILL SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOP A DATA ECOSYSTEM CONTAINING BIOMEDICAL DATA, INTEGRATED WITH WEATHER, AIR QUALITY AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DATA, AND OTHER GEOSPATIAL DATA WITHIN TWO EXISTING HIGHLY- COMPLEMENTARY DATA PLATFORMS (IBM-PAIRS AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN). OVER FIVE YEARS WE WILL IMPLEMENT TWO RESEARCH PROJECTS AND 10-12 PILOT PROJECTS, ALL STREAMLINED AND SUPPORTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION, DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS, AND TRAINING AND ENGAGEMENT CORES. THE FIRST PROJECT WILL IMPLEMENT AN INNOVATIVE DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO CHARACTERIZE THE CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF HEAT EXPOSURE IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND NEONATES. WE WILL REUSE DATA FROM COHORTS AND TRIALS AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN AND NEONATES CONDUCTED ACROSS SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA SINCE THE YEAR 2000. DATA FROM SYSTEMATICALLY IDENTIFIED STUDIES WILL BE INTEGRATED IN AN INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT DATA PLATFORM FROM DATA REPOSITORIES AND DATA OWNERS. THEN, ANALYSES OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEAT EXPOSURE AND OUTCOMES (PRETERM BIRTH, BIRTH WEIGHT AND PRE- ECLAMPSIA) WILL INFORM QUANTIFICATION OF HEAT-RELATED DISEASE BURDEN. FINALLY, TAKING ALL FINDINGS TOGETHER, WE WILL PILOT A DISTRICT-LEVEL CLIMATE CHANGE INDICATOR, THE FIRST OF ITS KIND. THE SECOND PROJECT ASSESSES THE BURDEN OF HEAT-RELATED MORBIDITY IN VULNERABLE URBAN SETTINGS USING GEOSPATIAL AND HEAT HAZARD ANALYSES IN ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE AND JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. THIS PROJECT USES MORE COMPLEX DATA AND DATA SOURCES ON THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND TOPOGRAPHY, FOR EXAMPLE, TO ASSESS HEAT-HEALTH IMPACTS, AND HOW THESE VARY ACROSS URBAN GEOGRAPHIES. ACTIVITIES WILL INFORM DEVELOPMENT OF AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM, INCLUDING A DIGITAL APP THAT DELIVERS INFORMATION TO PEOPLE ON THEIR FORECASTED RISKS OF HEAT-HEALTH DISEASE, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUALIZED RISK PROFILE, AS DETERMINED BY A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT WEATHER CONDITIONS, INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS, GEOLOCATION AND OTHER FACTORS THAT DRIVE RISK. THESE SYSTEMS ARE A CENTRAL ELEMENT IN HEATWAVE RESPONSES, ALLOW FOR ADEQUATE PREPARATIONS FOR HEAT EVENTS, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR VULNERABLE GROUPS AND INDUSTRY.

THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT (AUB) IN LEBANON (U01 APPLICATION) IS PARTNERING WITH YALE UNIVERSITY (U2R APPLICATION) IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA IN THE US TO ESTABLISH A GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND TRAINING HUB FOR THE MENA REGION (GEOHEALTH MENA), WHERE AUB SERVES AS THE HUB INSTITUTION AND ONE UNIVERSITY IN EACH OF EGYPT AND SUDAN WILL SERVE AS SPOKE INSTITUTIONS. THE AIM OF GEOHEALTH MENA IS TO BUILD AND STRENGTHEN EOH RESEARCH CAPACITY IN THE CONTEXT OF DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS, AT AUB, SISTER INSTITUTIONS, AND RELEVANT NGOS IN LEBANON AND THE MENA REGION. THE FOCUS OF THE CURRENT PROJECT WILL BE AGRICULTURAL HEALTH AND SAFETY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDE AMONG REFUGEE POPULATIONS. THE MENA REGION HOSTS MORE THAN 50% OF THE WORLD'S TOTAL POPULATION OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS AND REFUGEES. THE U01 APPLICATION PROPOSES TO EVALUATE THE PATHWAYS OF PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AMONG SYRIAN REFUGEE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS, INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION OF SUCH EXPOSURE WITH NEUROBEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES, AND EXPLORE THE ROLE OF SOCIAL FACTORS IN THIS ASSOCIATION. FINDINGS WILL INFORM POLICY AND PRACTICE GUIDELINES THAT CAN IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF ALL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM AT AUB WILL BUILD ON A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF STUDYING REFUGEE AND MIGRANT POPULATIONS AND TRANSLATING EVIDENCE INTO POLICY.

THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN TERMS OF HEAT WAVE, AIR POLLUTION, SPREAD OF VECTORS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OF FLOODING, DROUGHT, WILDFIRES, AS WELL AS MENTAL ILLNESSES. ONE OF THE REGIONS THAT WILL BE IMPACTED MOST FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA). YET, THERE IS VERY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS, THE POSSIBLE POLICIES AND INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS THEM, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LIMITED CAPACITY IN RESEARCH OF SUCH POLICIES AND INTERVENTIONS. THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL ESTABLISH THE GEOHEALTH HUB FOR CLIMATE CHANGE HEALTH IMPACTS IN MENA THROUGH ITS TWO COMPONENTS: THE U01 RESEARCH COMPONENT (1/2 GEOHEALTH HUB FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA- JORDAN) AND THE U2R TRAINING COMPONENT. THE RESEARCH AND TRAINING WILL TAKE PLACE IN JORDAN, LEBANON, AND MOROCCO. THE CLIMATE RELEVANT AREAS OF RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON HEAT WAVES, PRECIPITATION AND WATER QUALITY, AIR POLLUTION, AND DESERT DUST POLLUTION. COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSES OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH POLICIES WILL BE DETERMINED TO QUANTIFY HEALTH BENEFITS FROM INTERVENTIONS THROUGH ECONOMIC MODELS AND THEN INFORMING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE. THESE WILL BE LINKED TO THE U2R GEOHEALTH HUB TRAINING APPLICATION TITLED \u201c2/2 GEOHEALTH HUB FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA-U.S. THE TRAINING PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON CREATING A CADRE OF LOCAL EXPERTS IN ONE OR MORE OF THE AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IN THE SCOPE OF THE U01.

HUMAN BIOLOGY AND DISEASE. GENETIC MODEL ORGANISMS, INCLUDING ZEBRAFISH, PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS DISCOVERY PROCESS, BECAUSE GENETIC ANALYSIS CAN CONNECT GENE SEQUENCE AND FUNCTION. MODEL ORGANISM DATABASES, LIKE ZFIN, PROVIDE TOOLS REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS CONNECTION.  THE ZEBRAFISH HAS EMERGED AS A PREMIER ORGANISM TO STUDY VERTEBRATE BIOLOGY. POWERFUL TECHNIQUES ALLOW RAPID EFFICIENT GENERATION AND RECOVERY OF MUTATIONS AFFECTING GENES THAT ORCHESTRATE DEVELOPMENTAL PATTERNING, ORGANOGENESIS, PHYSIOLOGY, AND BEHAVIOR. IT IS EASY TO STUDY GENE FUNCTION BY GENERATING TRANSGENIC ZEBRAFISH, BY KNOCKING DOWN GENE FUNCTION WITH MORPHOLINO ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES, OR BY ALTERING GENE FUNCTION BY GENOME EDITING. THE GENOME HAS BEEN SEQUENCED AND ABOUT 50% OF THE PROTEIN CODING GENES HAVE BEEN MUTATED BY TARGETED GENE KNOCKOUT TECHNOLOGY. LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS ARE UNDERWAY OR PLANNED THAT WILL PRODUCE FUNCTIONAL DATA ABOUT ALMOST ALL THE GENES AND SEQUENCE-BASED FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS IN THE GENOME. MULTIPLE MUTATIONS AND GENE KNOCKDOWNS CAN BE COMBINED IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL TO STUDY GENE MODIFIERS AND OTHER GENETIC INTERACTIONS. THE FUNCTIONS OF MOST OF THESE GENES ARE CONSERVED AMONG VERTEBRATE GROUPS. THUS, ANALYSIS OF ZEBRAFISH MUTATIONS PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO GENE FUNCTIONS IN OTHER VERTEBRATES, INCLUDING HUMANS.  THE LONG TERM GOALS FOR ZFIN ARE A) TO BE THE COMMUNITY DATABASE RESOURCE FOR THE LABORATORY USE OF ZEBRAFISH, B) TO DEVELOP AND SUPPORT INTEGRATED ZEBRAFISH GENETIC, GENOMIC, DEVELOPMENTAL, AND PHYSIOLOGICAL INFORMATION, C) TO MAINTAIN THE DEFINITIVE REFERENCE DATA SETS OF ZEBRAFISH RESEARCH INFORMATION, D) TO LINK THIS INFORMATION EXTENSIVELY TO CORRESPONDING DATA IN OTHER MODEL ORGANISM AND HUMAN DATABASES, E) TO FACILITATE THE USE OF ZEBRAFISH AS A MODEL FOR HUMAN BIOLOGY, AND F) TO HELP SERVE THE BROAD NEEDS OF THE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH COMMUNITY.

HOWEVER, STUDIES ABOUT THEIR HEALTH IMPACTS ON THE POPULATIONS ARE SCARCE AND NOT LINKED TO CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES AND THERE IS LIMITED MULTI-COUNTRY EFFORTS IN THE MENA REGION TO ADDRESS THE DIFFERENT HEALTH EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IN OUR PROJECT, WE AIM TO ESTABLISH THE \u201cGEOHEALTH HUB FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH IN MENA\u201d THROUGH TWO COMPONENTS: THE U2R WHICH REPRESENTS THE PART RELATED TO CAPACITY BUILDING OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE MENA REGIONS AND THE U01 WHICH IS THE COMPONENT DEVELOPING THE RESEARCH PROFILE. FROM MENA, THE JORDAN UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, THE UNIVERSITY OF BALAMAND, AND MOHAMED VI UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES WILL BE PARTNERING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY, AND HARVARD UNIVERSITY FROM THE U.S. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. CDC, AND THE WHO CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ACTION WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE HUB. THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON HEALTH, WATER, AIR POLLUTION AND IDENTIFIED GAPS AND AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BE THE INITIAL FOCUS OF THE HUB. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE AND SUPPORT CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES THAT PROTECT AND PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND BECOME THE STATE-OF-THE-ART ENTITY TO PROVIDE MODELS AND TOOLS FOR QUANTIFYING THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS IN RELATION TO WATER SCARCITY, HEAT WAVES, AIR POLLUTION, AND DESERT DUST. THE RESEARCH PROJECT IN JORDAN WILL STUDY THE IMPACT OF TWO CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS: (1) WATER SCARCITY AND NITRATE POLLUTION AND (2) HEATWAVES. THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DOWNSCALED CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE CONSTRUCTED TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF NITRATE POLLUTION ACROSS JORDAN WILL BE ASSESSED. MOREOVER, THE IMPACT OF NITRATE LEVELS ON BIRTH WEIGHT OF NEWBORNS WILL BE DOCUMENTED. FURTHERMORE, THE IMPACT OF HEATWAVES ON MORTALITY UNDER THE BASELINE CLIMATE SCENARIO AS WELL AS UNDER THE CLIMATE ENSEMBLE MODEL PREDICTIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED. IN LEBANON, THE HEALTH IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION ON RESPIRATORY, CARDIOVASCULAR, AND SKIN ALLERGIC DISEASES AMONG WOMEN AND CHILDREN WILL BE STUDIED. IN MOROCCO, THE ASSOCIATION OF DESERT DUST AIR POLLUTION WITH CLIMATE WILL BE DETERMINED USING LARGE-SCALE ATMOSPHERIC PATTERNS AND CLIMATE INDICES.

ULAANBAATAR (UB) AND DARKHAN CITY (DC) HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST AMBIENT PARTICULATE MATTER (PM) CONCENTRATIONS IN THE WORLD AND FREQUENTLY SUFFER EPIDEMICS OF VIRAL RESPIRATORY DISEASES. THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PM EXPOSURE AND CARDIORESPIRATORY MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED, WITH AN ESTABLISHED 6.67 MILLION PREMATURE DEATHS GLOBALLY ATTRIBUTED TO AIR POLLUTION IN 2019. RECENTLY, ATTENTION HAS INCREASED REGARDING THE ASSOCIATION OF PM POLLUTION AND RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTION. HENCE, THIS U01 PROPOSAL, AS PART OF THE MONGOLIAN GEOHEALTH HUB PROGRAM, FOCUSES ON STUDYING THE RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PM EXPOSURE AND RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTIONS. THE U01 PROJECT CONSISTS OF A MAIN STUDY AND TWO PILOT STUDIES TO BEGIN CENTER ACTIVITIES. THE MAIN PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PM EXPOSURE WEAKENS THE IMMUNE DEFENSE AGAINST RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTION. IT HAS THREE INTERCONNECTED SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1 IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PM EXPOSURE AND RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTION THROUGH A TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS OF WEEKLY INFLUENZA-LIKE ILLNESS (ILI) RATES IN ASSOCIATION WITH PM LEVELS WITHIN AND ACROSS UB AND DC, ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS AND CO-POLLUTANTS. AS AN AIR POLLUTION CONTROL MEASURE, UB STARTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCESSED COAL USE IN MAY, 2019, WHEREAS DC CONTINUES TO USE RAW COAL. NESTING THIS POLICY INTERVENTION INTO THE TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS STRENGTHENS THE CAUSAL INFERENCE OF THE PM-ILI ASSOCIATION DERIVED FROM NATURAL VARIABILITIES OVER TIME. AIM 2 IS TO EXAMINE IMMUNOLOGIC AND VIRAL RESPONSES TO PERSONAL PM EXPOSURE THROUGH TWO PARALLEL PANEL STUDIES IN RESIDENTS OF UB AND DC, RESPECTIVELY. EACH PANEL CONSISTS OF 100-120 NONSMOKING ADULTS WHO WILL BE MEASURED SEMIANNUALLY DURING A 3-YEAR FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. ILI COUNTS AND IMMUNOLOGIC BIOMARKERS WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL PM EXPOSURES. AIM 3 IS TO DEFINE THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF PM EXPOSURE ON EPITHELIAL INTEGRITY AND IMMUNE SIGNALING AND THE SUBSEQUENT IMPACT ON ANTI-VIRAL RESPONSES. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CELL CULTURE STUDIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO AIM 2 SUBJECTS (AS CELL DONORS). THE TWO PILOT STUDIES, BUILT UPON THE AIM 2 MAIN STUDY, AIM TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF PM ON PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS AND BONE MINERAL LOSS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE STUDIES ARE MOTIVATED BY HIGH PREVALENCE OF BOTH TUBERCULOSIS AND OSTEOPOROSIS IN MONGOLIA AND BY EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTING PM OR HEAVY METALS IN PM AS RISK FACTORS. THIS U01 PROPOSAL IS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROJECT INVOLVING RESEARCHERS IN EPIDEMIOLOGY, TOXICOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, EXPOSURE SCIENCE, BIOSTATISTICS, VIROLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, RESPIRATORY MEDICINE, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE FROM MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS IN MONGOLIA, DUKE UNIVERSITY, AND DUKE KUNSHAN UNIVERSITY.

ABSTRACT  OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF EARLY LIFE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO A BROAD ARRAY OF PATHOGENIC AND COMMENSAL MICROBES AND EXPOSURE TO MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROGNOSIS OF ALLERGIC DISEASES FROM BIRTH UP TO AGE 18 YEARS AND THEIR UNDERLYING MOLECULAR PATHWAYS. OUR PROJECT IS MOTIVATED BY GROWING EVIDENCE THAT IN-UTERO AND THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE ARE CRITICAL WINDOWS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMMUNITY, AND BY OBSERVATIONS THAT EARLY LIFE EXPOSURES TO MICROBES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS MAY HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON FUTURE RISK OF ALLERGIC DISEASES. TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL, WE WILL LEVERAGE THE RICH RESOURCES OF THE BOSTON BIRTH COHORT (BBC), WITH ~3,500 MOTHER-CHILD PAIRS WHO WERE ENROLLED AT BIRTH AND FOLLOWED PROSPECTIVELY. THROUGH OUR PRIOR RESEARCH IN THE BBC, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED ESSENTIAL CLINICAL, LABORATORY AND COMPUTATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES, AND OBTAINED LONGITUDINAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL DATA, AND MULTI-OMICS (GENOME, EPIGENOME, METABOLOME) DATA AS WELL AS ARCHIVED BIOSPECIMENS. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE BBC IS A HIGH-RISK POPULATION FOR ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND THE CHILDREN OF THE BBC HAVE A HIGH PREVALENCE OF IMMUNE-RELATED DISORDERS, INCLUDING FOOD ALLERGIES, EARLY CHILDHOOD RECURRENT WHEEZING AND CHILDHOOD ASTHMA. THE BREADTH, DEPTH, AND HIGH QUALITY OF THE BBC DATA AND BIOREPOSITORY HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN OVER 120 PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS. WE ALSO HAVE GENERATED COMPELLING PRELIMINARY DATA TO SUPPORT OUR STUDY AIMS AND HYPOTHESES. SPECIFICALLY, BY INCLUDING 1,000 MOTHER-CHILD DYADS OF THE BBC WITH KEY LONGITUDINAL DATA ELEMENTS AND BIOSPECIMENS FROM BIRTH UP TO AGE 18 YEARS, WE AIM TO INVESTIGATE: (1) EFFECTS OF EARLY LIFE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO MICROBES ON CHILD ALLERGIC PHENOTYPES; (2) EFFECTS OF EARLY LIFE EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS (E.G., AIR POLLUTION, TOXIC METALS) ON CHILD ALLERGIC PHENOTYPES; AND (3) MOLECULAR PATHWAYS UNDERLYING THE LINK BETWEEN EARLY LIFE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND ALLERGIC DISEASES. WE WILL HARNESS CUTTING-EDGE ANTIBODY PROFILING TECHNOLOGY (PHIP-SEQ) TO PROFILE IGG AND IGE ANTIBODIES IN 1,000 BBC CHILDREN AT THREE IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTAL WINDOWS (BIRTH, 1-2 YEARS, AND 15-18 YEARS). THIS WILL PROVIDE DEEP PHENOTYPING OF A CHILD\u2019S ANTIBODY PROFILE AND IDENTIFY LONGITUDINAL CHANGES IN THE CONTEXT OF PRENATAL, PERINATAL, AND POSTNATAL GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS. OUR ABILITY TO PROFILE THE ANTIBODY REPERTOIRE AND DEFINE ALLERGIC PHENOTYPES ACROSS CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTAL WINDOWS ALLOW US TO DELINEATE THEIR LONGITUDINAL TRAJECTORIES, TEMPORAL AND DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE EXPOSURES AND OUTCOMES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS STUDY WILL HELP IDENTIFY IMPORTANT EARLY LIFE RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS, ALONG WITH NOVEL BIOMARKERS FOR PREDICTION OR THERAPEUTIC TARGETS. ULTIMATELY, WE HOPE THAT HIGH-RISK NEWBORNS CAN BE IDENTIFIED, AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS CAN BE INITIATED DURING THE EARLIEST DEVELOPMENTAL WINDOWS WHEN THEY MAY HAVE THE GREATEST LIFE- LONG BENEFIT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01ES034983_7529"}, {"internal_id": 85590877, "Award ID": "U01ES031786", "Award Amount": 866508.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-11", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "STANDARDIZING Q-PCR AND DEVELOPING AND TESTING A NEW DNA-FISH METHOD FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT ASSESSMENT OF TELOMERE LENGTH USING GENOMIC DNA", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "82335220-b01b-63c5-95b9-6dcae60104e4-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01ES031786_7529"}, {"internal_id": 85589233, "Award ID": "U01ES030949", "Award Amount": 948300.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-12", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "THE COMPARABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF TELOMERE LENGTH MEASUREMENTS FOR POPULATION-BASED STUDIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f12508df-b414-7a41-54a0-3351d8ed6cb0-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01ES030949_7529"}, {"internal_id": 109278640, "Award ID": "U01ES030674", "Award Amount": 1351601.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-19", "CFDA Number": "93.310", "Description": "ANTIDOTES AGAINST HCI-INDUCED CHRONIC LUNG INJURY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b1fffbad-4cbb-7696-ed95-88de0b51b797-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01ES030674_7529"}, {"internal_id": 83796788, "Award ID": "U01ES030672", "Award Amount": 2305444.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-26", "CFDA Number": "93.310", "Description": "ADVANCED TRPA1 INHIBITOR FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHLORINE INHALATION INJURY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6f191f83-6024-f2be-3012-4b740b10ac7a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01ES030672_7529"}, {"internal_id": 68566959, "Award ID": "U01ES029660", "Award Amount": 3571712.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-09-12", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "DNA REPAIR PHENOTYPE THE MISSING LINK IN BREAST CANCER RISK ASSESSMENT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "5f6a3877-304a-f4ec-9bd4-082c57aa1297-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01ES029660_7529"}, {"internal_id": 69725337, "Award ID": "U01ES029603", "Award Amount": 2276927.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-09-20", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "MEASURING NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR IN HUMAN POPULATIONS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "75c0ae0f-6a5f-aead-72df-d28c71c0d348-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01ES029603_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151590527, "Award ID": "U01ES029531", "Award Amount": 289545.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-23", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY SETTING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL METALS MIXTURES AND BIRTH DEFECTS - BIRTH DEFECTS ARE THE LEADING KNOWN CAUSE OF INFANT MORTALITY AND ONE OF THE LEADING  SOURCES OF YEARS OF POTENTIAL LIFE LOST. IN FACT, ONE OUT OF EVERY 33 LIVE BIRTHS IN THE UNITED  STATES RESULTS IN A BIRTH DEFECT. THE LACK OF KNOWN, MODIFIABLE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED  WITH BIRTH DEFECTS REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO PROGRESS. IN PRIOR WORK, OUR TEAM EXAMINED   EXPOSURE TO ARSENIC, MANGANESE, CADMIUM, AND LEAD IN RELATION TO BIRTH DEFECTS. WE  HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT EXPOSURE TO A TOXIC METALS MIXTURE THROUGH PRIVATE WELL-WATER IS  ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK FOR BIRTH DEFECTS. SPECIFICALLY, IN AREAS WHERE ARSENIC AND  MANGANESE CO-OCCUR, WE OBSERVED HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED PREVALENCE OF BIRTH DEFECTS. CURRENT  FILTRATION TECHNOLOGY IS SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE EXPOSURES TO MANY TOXIC METALS.  UNFORTUNATELY, WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF FILTRATION IS INFEASIBLE DUE TO COST, AND THERE IS A  SUBSTANTIAL GAP IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TO BEST INTERVENE. IDEALLY, CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS OF WATER  FILTRATION WOULD BE USED TO GUIDE DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO INTERVENE, BUT, CRITICALLY, OBTAINING  SUCH DATA IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. THUS, PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD BE WELL SERVED BY USING  EXISTING, OBSERVATIONAL DATA TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF SUCH INTERVENTIONS. THIS INNOVATIVE  PROJECT WILL USE STATE-OF-THE-ART STATISTICAL METHODS TO DIRECTLY QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF  POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS ON TOXIC METAL MIXTURES EXPOSURE AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING THE  RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS. THIS APPROACH CAN BE USED WITH VARYING LEVELS OF SOPHISTICATION TO ADAPT TO  LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS. THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT WE CAN USE ROUTINELY  COLLECTED SURVEILLANCE DATA TO IDENTIFY THE PUBLIC HEALTH BURDEN OF BIRTH DEFECTS IN NORTH CAROLINA  DUE TO TOXIC METALS EXPOSURES, AS WELL AS IDENTIFY INTERVENTIONS TO MAXIMIZE REDUCTIONS IN THIS  BURDEN UNDER REALISTIC CONSTRAINTS ON COST AND FEASIBILITY. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS IN THREE  SPECIFIC AIMS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL ESTIMATE THE RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO TOXIC  METAL MIXTURES USING DATA ON WELL WATER CONTAMINATION AND 1.2 MILLION NC BIRTHS FROM  2003-2013 FROM THE NC DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE NC BIRTH  DEFECTS MONITORING PROGRAM. WE WILL APPLY A CUTTING-EDGE FRAMEWORK THAT COMBINES BAYESIAN   METHODOLOGY WITH A CAUSAL INFERENCE FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE ATTRIBUTABLE RISKS FROM HIGHLY  CORRELATED EXPOSURES. IN AIM 2, WE APPLY OUR FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE THE REDUCTIONS IN THE  ATTRIBUTABLE RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS UNDER POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING FILTRATION OR CHANGING  WATER SOURCES. WE WILL CONTRAST BIRTH DEFECTS RISKS UNDER INTERVENTIONS THAT TARGET AREAS OF  CONCERN, SUCH AS HIGHLY EXPOSED AREAS, AS A WAY TO MAXIMIZE REDUCTIONS IN BIRTH DEFECTS. IN AIM 3,  WE WILL CONDUCT A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO REDUCE  BIRTH DEFECTS. THIS WORK IS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN HOW ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES CAN  BE ADDRESSED. THE RESULTS WILL PROVIDE STAKEHOLDERS WITH DATA FOR EFFECTIVE DECISION   MAKING.

PRE- AND POSTNATAL HAZARDS INCLUDE MATERNAL SUBSTANCE EXPOSURE, TOXICANT EXPOSURES IN PREGNANCY AND EARLY LIFE, MATERNAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, PARENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, MALTREATMENT, STRUCTURAL RACISM, AND EXCESSIVE STRESS. TO ELUCIDATE HOW VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS IMPACT CHILD DEVELOPMENT, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT A NORMATIVE TEMPLATE OF DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OVER THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF LIFE BE ESTABLISHED BASED ON A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE SAMPLE OF THE US POPULATION.

THEREFORE, FIU HAS A PROVEN RECORD OF RECRUITING, RETAINING AND GRADUATING MINORITY STUDENTS, AND A LEADERSHIP COMMITTED TO PROVIDING INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL STUDENT OUTCOMES. THE TEN PROGRAM AIMS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO A NEW GENERATION OF INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENTISTS WORKING AT THE UNIQUE INTERFACE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND NEUROSCIENCE TERMED ENVIRONMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE. AS THE BURDEN OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE AND DISORDERS INCREASES AT AN ALARMING RATE, ESPECIALLY AMONG UNDERSERVED MINORITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ARE RECOGNIZED AS SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS. THUS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR A NEW GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS, ESPECIALLY FROM UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES, TRAINED AT THE INTERFACE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND NEUROSCIENCE. THE EXISTING BRAIN, BEHAVIOR, AND ENVIRONMENT (BBE) CENTER AT FIU IS UNIQUELY POISED TO PROVIDE THIS RESEARCH TRAINING AND PROVIDES STRONG INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND HOME FOR THE PROPOSED PROGRAM. AS A DESIGNATED EMERGING PREEMINENT PROGRAM AT FIU, BBE BRINGS TOGETHER FACULTY AND STUDENTS FROM THE ROBERT STEMPEL COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, THE COLLEGE OF ARTS, SCIENCES AND EDUCATION, THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING. THE MISSION OF THE PROPOSED TEN PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE TALENTED AND MOTIVATED PREDOCTORAL AND POSTDOCTORAL TRAINEES WITH RIGOROUS DIDACTIC AND LABORATORY TRAINING IN CONTEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND NEUROSCIENCE. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARE FOR TRAINEES TO 1) ACQUIRE FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND NEUROSCIENCE; 2) BECOME PROFICIENT AT INTEGRATING CONCEPTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND NEUROSCIENCE INTO CUTTING EDGE BASIC, CLINICAL, AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH; AND 3) GAIN THE NECESSARY SKILLS AND TOOLS TO LEVERAGE THIS UNIQUE TRAINING TO ACHIEVE THEIR NEXT CAREER OBJECTIVE. THE PROGRAM PROPOSES TO SUPPORT A COHORT OF 2 PRE- AND 2-POST-DOCTORAL TRAINEES IN YEAR 1, INCREASING TO 3 PRE- AND 3 POST-DOCTORAL TRAINEES/YEAR THEREAFTER. THE CORE CURRICULUM FOR PHD STUDENTS INCLUDES DIDACTIC COURSEWORK IN ENVIRONMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, NEUROSCIENCE, NEUROTOXICOLOGY, ADVANCED METHODS IN NEUROSCIENCE/NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND RESEARCH DESIGN AND ANALYSIS. THIS DIDACTIC TRAINING IS COMPLEMENTED BY CAREER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, TRAINING IN RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH AND RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY, AND PROGRAMMATIC/NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES. POSTDOCTORAL TRAINEES WILL ALSO PARTICIPATE IN SELECTED COMPONENTS OF THE DIDACTIC PROGRAM, DEPENDING UPON THEIR BACKGROUND, AND BE PROVIDED WITH ADDITIONAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

AROUND THE WORLD.5-8 THE CRISIS OBSERVED IN FLINT, MICHIGAN IN 2014 PUT LEAD EXPOSURE INTO THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT INCREASING CONSUMER AWARENESS. SEVEN YEARS LATER, LEAD CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES REMAINS A NATIONAL ISSUE. LEAD FILTERS CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET LACK SPECIFICITY WITH LIMITED DEVICE LIFETIME DICTATED BY THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WATER VOLUME FILTERED, REGARDLESS OF LEAD CONCENTRATION. INCUMBENT SOLUTIONS FOR HOME WATER PURIFICATION ARE ARCHAIC AND OUTDATED. ELECTRAMETTM FROM POWERTECH WATER (PTW) IS AN ELECTROCHEMICAL FILTER THAT CAN TARGET THE REMOVAL OF LEAD. THE DEVICE USES ACTIVATED CARBON ELECTRODES AND A SMALL APPLIED VOLTAGE (< 2.0 V) TO INDUCE FARADAIC REACTIONS AT BOTH THE CARBON-BASED ANODES AND CATHODES WITHIN THE CELL. BY TUNING THE DEVICE CONFIGURATION AND OPERATING PARAMETERS, LEAD WILL PRECIPITATE OUT OF SOLUTION, AND BE PERMANENTLY REMOVED WHILE OTHER DISSOLVED MINERALS ARE LEFT UNAFFECTED. IN THIS CRP PROJECT, PTW'S GOAL IS TO DESIGN A POU DEVICE THAT MEETS TARGET END-USE PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS AND CERTIFICATION STANDARDS. AT THE COMPLETION OF THIS WORK, WE ANTICIPATE A CONSUMER-FOCUSED DEVICE THAT EXCEEDS THE PERFORMANCE OF CURRENT OFF-THE-SHELF SOLUTIONS. THE DEVICE WILL BE RELIABLE AND SPECIFIC FOR LEAD, HAVE A MULTI-YEAR SYSTEM LIFETIME, AND WILL NOT BE CONSUMED BY ABUNDANT WATER CONSTITUENTS. THESE PERFORMANCE TARGETS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. PRODUCT FORM FACTOR DESIGN FOR A POU SOLUTION. EXPECTED OUTCOME: A DESIGN THAT FITS UNDER THE SINK AND  MEETS PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE OVERALL DEVICE SIZE, PRESSURE TOLERANCE, PRICE POINT, AND LEAD REMOVAL PERFORMANCE. 2. REPLICATION OF TESTING STANDARDS TO OBTAIN DRINKING WATER FILTRATION CERTIFICATIONS. EXPECTED OUTCOME:  ELECTRAMETTM PERFORMANCE TO MEET NSF/ANSI 53 AND 61 CERTIFICATION STANDARDS FOR LEAD REMOVAL AND  STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY. 3.

OCULAR SAFETY TESTS HAVE ROUTINELY BEEN CONDUCTED ON LIVE ANIMALS WITH A TIME TO RESULTS OF UP TO 21 DAYS AND ARE CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE INHUMANE. RECENT GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION AND CONSUMER PRESSURE ARE DIRECTED AT REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE USE OF LIVE ANIMALS FOR THE ROUTINE TESTING OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND COSMETICS. HOWEVER, LIMITED OPTIONS EXIST FOR NONANIMAL TESTING. CURRENTLY, ACCEPTED NONANIMAL TEST METHODS REQUIRE THE ADVANCED PURCHASE (UP TO THREE WEEKS) OF LIVE TISSUES AND A TECHNICIAN SKILLED IN ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE; ADDITIONALLY, SUCH TESTS DO NOT HAVE A LONG SHELF LIFE OR MISCLASSIFY OCULAR CORROSIVES AS NONIRRITANTS, ARE TIME INTENSIVE, AND REQUIRE OTHER ADVANCED LABORATORY TECHNIQUES INCLUDING CELL CULTURE OR DISSECTION AND SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF OCULAR LESIONS. THE SUBJECT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE PRODUCTION OF A RAPID, IRRITANCY-PREDICTIVE, QUANTITATIVE, STANDARDIZED TEST KIT WITH A ONE-YEAR SHELF LIFE TO PROVIDE STANDARDIZED RESULTS MORE ACCURATELY AND WITH HIGHER SENSITIVITY THAN ANY OTHER AVAILABLE NONANIMAL OCULAR IRRITATION TEST.

THESE LESIONS HAVE HALF-LIVES OF SEVERAL HOURS TO DAYS IN DNA AND THUS CAN AFFECT DNA REPLICATION AND TRANSCRIPTION. THE POSITIVELY CHARGED N7-ALKYLG LESIONS CAN ALSO UNDERGO FURTHER MODIFICATION TO GENERATE SECONDARY LESIONS SUCH AS ALKYL-FORMAMIDOPYRIMIDINE (ALKYL-FAPYG) ADDUCTS. THE RECOGNITION, REPAIR, AND MUTAGENESIS MECHANISMS OF MANY MUTAGEN/CARCINOGEN-INDUCED N7- ALKYLG AND ALKYL-FAPYG LESIONS, EXCEPT FOR A FEW LESIONS SUCH AS N7-AFLATOXIN B1-G AND AFLATOXIN B1-FAPYG ADDUCTS, REMAIN POORLY CHARACTERIZED, THEREBY PRECLUDING A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE MAJOR LESIONS TO MUTATIONS AND CANCER DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MUTAGENIC PROPERTIES OF THE PREDOMINANT N7-ALKYLG ADDUCTS PRODUCED BY THE CANCER-PROMOTING STYRENE OXIDE ARE UNKNOWN. THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP HAS BEEN DUE IN PART TO THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY IN PREPARING A SITE-SPECIFIC N7-ALKYLG- AND ALKYL-FAPYG-CONTAINING DNA, WHICH IS ASCRIBED TO THE RAPID DEPURINATION OF N7-ALKYLG NUCLEOSIDES AND THE FACILE ISOMERIZATION OF ALKYL- FAPYG DURING SOLID-PHASE DNA SYNTHESIS. TO OVERCOME THE STABILITY ISSUE OF N7-ALKYLG NUCLEOSIDES, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A 2\u2019-FLUORINE TECHNOLOGY THAT PREVENTS SPONTANEOUS DEPURINATION BY INCREASING THE STABILITY OF N7- ALKYLG NUCLEOSIDES. TO SOLVE THE ISOMERIZATION PROBLEM OF ALKYL-FAPYG, WE HAVE TAKEN A POST-SYNTHETIC APPROACH THAT PRODUCES ALKYL-FAPYG-CONTAINING DNA FROM N7-ALKYLG-CONTAINING DNA. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES SHOW THAT GUANINE N7 ALKYLATION CAN INFLUENCE BASE-PAIRING PROPERTIES BY FACILITATING THE FORMATION OF THE RARE ENOL TAUTOMER, SYN BASE CONFORMATION, AND/OR INTERCALATION.

INCREASINGLY, EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EXPOSURE TO METABOLISM DISRUPTING ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS SUCH AS PHTHALATES, CAN DYSREGULATE THE BODY\u2019S ABILITY TO ADAPT APPROPRIATELY TO THE DEMANDS OF PREGNANCY. PHTHALATES DISRUPT MULTIPLE NUCLEAR RECEPTOR AND HORMONE-MEDIATED PATHWAYS AND IN CROSS-SECTIONAL RESEARCH, THEY HAVE BEEN LINKED TO OBESITY, DIABETES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD), AND METABOLIC SYNDROME. OUR RESEARCH IN MULTIPLE PREGNANCY COHORTS DEMONSTRATES THAT ELEVATED CONCENTRATIONS OF CERTAIN PHTHALATE METABOLITES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE CARDIOMETABOLIC OUTCOMES INCLUDING EXCESSIVE GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN, GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS, AND IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE. IN THE POSTPARTUM, MATERNAL PHYSIOLOGY MUST READJUST TO THE NON-PREGNANT STATE, A PHYSIOLOGICAL \u201cRESET\u201d THAT MAY BE A SECOND CRITICAL PERIOD OF HEIGHTENED VULNERABILITY TO ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION. DYSREGULATION DURING THIS TIME IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY ADAPT TO THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM MAY INCREASE FUTURE RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASE (E.G. CVD, TYPE 2 DIABETES). THE OVER-ARCHING HYPOTHESIS OF THIS RESEARCH IS THAT PREGNANCY AND THE POSTPARTUM ARE SENSITIVE WINDOWS DURING WHICH PHTHALATES MAY DYSREGULATE MATERNAL PHYSIOLOGY, LEADING TO LONG-TERM CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH RISKS.

THE ROLE OF ESTROGENIC COMPOUNDS ON INFLUENCING COLONIC INFLAMMATION IS COMPLICATED, BUT CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA SUGGEST THAT XES EXACERBATE SYMPTOMS AND MARKERS OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC), WHICH IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT DISEASE STATE THAT REQUIRES MEDICAL INTERVENTION THROUGHOUT LIFE.

OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE ENDOGENOUS MECHANISMS OF CADMIUM DETOXIFICATION THAT CAN BE ADAPTED FOR THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT. USING THE POWERFUL C. ELEGANS MODEL SYSTEM, WE DISCOVERED THAT EXPOSURE TO HIGH DIETARY ZINC STIMULATES LYSOSOME BIOGENESIS BY ACTIVATING THE MASTER TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATOR, TFEB (HLH-30 IN C. ELEGANS). CADMIUM IS SIMILAR TO ZINC, AND CADMIUM EXPOSURE CAUSES A TRANSCRIPTIONAL RESPONSE SIMILAR TO ZINC EXCESS. WE PROPOSE THE INNOVATIVE HYPOTHESIS THAT TFEB PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CADMIUM DETOXIFICATION BY ENHANCING LYSOSOME BIOGENESIS, LEADING TO INCREASED METAL SEQUESTRATION, AND BY ENHANCING MITOCHONDRIAL QUALITY. HERE WE PROPOSE TO RIGOROUSLY TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY CONDUCTING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS USING A WIDE RANGE OF GENETIC AND CELL BIOLOGY TECHNIQUES. WE WILL EXPLOIT C. ELEGANS AS WELL AS THE CLINICALLY RELEVANT MOUSE MODEL AND EXPLORE THE USE OF TREHALOSE AS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC THAT ACTIVATES TFEB. AIM 1: CHARACTERIZE THE FUNCTION AND REGULATION OF THE HLH-30/TFEB SIGNALING AXIS DURING CADMIUM EXPOSURE IN C. ELEGANS AND MICE. WE WILL ANALYZE ACCUMULATION OF CADMIUM AND THE ROLE OF LYSOSOMES IN CADMIUM RESISTANCE IN C. ELEGANS.

THE REGULATION OF HLH-30 BY CADMIUM EXPOSURE WILL BE DETERMINED IN C. ELEGANS. TO ESTABLISH THE FUNCTION OF TFEB DURING CADMIUM EXPOSURE IN MICE, WE WILL GENERATE GENETICALLY TARGETED MICE THAT OVER-EXPRESS OR LACK TFEB SPECIFICALLY IN HEPATOCYTES OR IN RENAL TUBULAR CELLS. LIVER OR RENAL INJURY WILL BE MEASURED AFTER CADMIUM EXPOSURE. WE WILL DETERMINE HOW CADMIUM EXPOSURE REGULATES TFEB SIGNALING IN MURINE HEPATOCYTES AND PROXIMAL RENAL TUBULAR CELLS.

"93.113", "Description": "PROTEIN KINASE C AND LUNG CARCINOGENESIS - ABSTRACT  KRAS MUTATIONS REPRESENT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON EARLY MOLECULAR EVENTS LEADING TO ONCOGENIC TRANSFORMATION IN LUNG CANCER. ENVIRONMENTAL CARCINOGENS SUCH AS BENZO[A]PYRENE (B[A]P) AND OTHER POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS INDUCE MUTATIONS IN KRAS IN CELLULAR MODELS AND IN VIVO. OUR STUDIES IDENTIFIED THE ONCOGENIC KINASE PROTEIN KINASE C EPSILON (PKCE) AS A KEY PLAYER IN CANCER DEVELOPMENT. PKCE IS ABERRANTLY UP-REGULATED IN LUNG CANCER AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR OUTCOME IN LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA PATIENTS SPECIFICALLY HARBORING KRAS MUTATIONS. USING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MICE (GEM), WE RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED THE REQUIREMENT OF PKCE FOR KRAS- DRIVEN LUNG TUMORIGENESIS IN VIVO. IN ADDITION, B[A]P-INDUCED LUNG CARCINOGENESIS IS ABROGATED IN PKCE KO MICE, A STRONG INDICATION FOR THE INVOLVEMENT OF PKCE IN ONCOGENIC KRAS-MEDIATED TUMOR INITIATION AND IN ENVIRONMENTAL CARCINOGENESIS. SINCE CRISPR-MEDIATED INACTIVATION OF PKCE IN THE INITIATING CELL-OF-ORIGIN DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT KRAS-G12D-INDUCED TUMOR DEVELOPMENT, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THIS KINASE MAY NOT STRICTLY ACT IN A TUMOR CELL AUTONOMOUS MANNER TO PERMIT ONCOGENIC KRAS-MEDIATED TUMORIGENESIS IN VIVO. BEYOND ITS ROLE IN CANCER INITIATION, WE ALSO IDENTIFIED PKCE AS AN ESSENTIAL DRIVER OF CANCER CELL MOTILITY VIA THE ACTIVATION OF THE SMALL GTPASE RAC1 AND THE REORGANIZATION OF THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON INTO PRO-MOTILE RUFFLE PROTRUSIONS. THUS, THIS KINASE IS IMPLICATED IN MULTIPLE STAGES OF LUNG CANCER. IN AIM 1, TO ELUCIDATE A NON-CANCER CELL-AUTONOMOUS ROLE FOR PKCE IN ONCOGENIC KRAS-MEDIATED TUMOR DEVELOPMENT, WE WILL GENERATE AND CHARACTERIZE A SERIES OF LUNG-SPECIFIC KRAS-DRIVEN KNOCK-IN MOUSE MODELS TO RESTRICT GENETIC DELETION OF PKCE TO EITHER ONCOGENIC KRAS-EXPRESSING CELLS OR MICROENVIRONMENTAL CELLS, INCLUDING NON-CANCEROUS EPITHELIAL CELLS, MESENCHYME CELLS, AND HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS. GENE EXPRESSION STUDIES ON ISOLATED CELLS USING FLUORESCENCE-BASED LINEAGE TRACING TECHNIQUES WILL PROVIDE MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS IN THIS CONTEXT. IN AIM 2, WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PKCE ACTS THROUGH THE ACTIVATION OF RAC GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTORS (RAC-GEFS) RESPONSIBLE FOR RAC1 ACTIVATION TO PROMOTE MOTILITY SIGNALING IN KRAS MUTANT LUNG CANCER CELLS. WE DESIGNED A SCREEN TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATE RAC-GEFS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PHENOTYPE, WHICH WILL BE COMPREHENSIVELY CHARACTERIZED TO DISSECT THE MECHANISTIC BASIS OF RAC1 ACTIVATION BY PKCE. ALSO, A PHOSPHO-PROTEOME SIGNATURE DRIVEN BY PKCE ACTIVATION WILL BE ESTABLISHED USING MASS SPECTROMETRY. IN AIM 3, WE WILL ESTABLISH THE INVOLVEMENT OF PKCE AND RAC-GEF EFFECTORS IN LUNG CANCER METASTASIS. WE WILL USE COMBINED IN VITRO AND IN VIVO APPROACHES TO DISSECT MECHANISTIC DEFECTS IN THE METASTATIC CASCADE UPON CRISPR-MEDIATED DELETION OF PKCE AND THE IDENTIFIED RAC-GEFS IN LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA CELLS. WE WILL ESTABLISH GEM MODELS AND USE LENTIVIRAL CRISPR-BASED APPROACHES TO DETERMINE THE PERMISSIVE CONTRIBUTION OF PKCE AND RAC-GEFS TO LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA METASTASIS, AND IDENTIFY RELEVANT GENE EXPRESSION AND SIGNALING SIGNATURES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE OBSERVED PHENOTYPES.

PER- AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFAS), ALSO COMMONLY KNOWN AS PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS, ARE A LARGE FAMILY OF MAN-MADE, GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED CHEMICALS THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR DECADES. PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID (PFOA) AND PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE (PFOS) ARE THE MOST COMMON PFAS, BUT THOUSANDS OF OTHER DERIVATIVES EXIST. PFAS HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS NON-STICK COOKWARE (TEFLON\u00ae), CARPETS AND CARPET TREATMENT PRODUCTS (SCOTCHGARD\u00ae), FOOD PACKAGING, AQUEOUS FIREFIGHTING FOAMS, HYDRAULIC AVIATION FUELS AND IN THE AEROSPACE, AUTOMOTIVE, CONSTRUCTION, AND ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES. PFAS ARE EMERGING ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS IN GROUNDWATER, AND THEY ARE ATTRACTING SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION DUE TO THEIR GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION, PERSISTENCE, TOXICITY AND TENDENCY TO BIO- ACCUMULATE. PFAS CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN FOUND IN MORE THAN 1400 LOCATIONS IN 49 STATES AND THE EPA ESTIMATES THAT THE DRINKING WATER OF MORE THAN 110 MILLION AMERICANS MAY ALREADY BE CONTAMINATED. ONCE RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, THEY ARE NOT EASILY BROKEN DOWN BY AIR, WATER, OR SUNLIGHT. THUS, PEOPLE CAN BE EXPOSED TO PFAS THAT WERE MANUFACTURED DECADES IN THE PAST. PFAS CAN TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES IN THE AIR AND WATER, EXPOSING PEOPLE TO PFAS MANUFACTURED OR EMITTED FROM FACILITIES MANY MILES AWAY. HUMAN EXPOSURE CAN ALSO OCCUR THROUGH CONTACT WITH PRODUCTS CONTAINING PFAS. IN 2016, EPA ESTABLISHED A LIFETIME HEALTH ADVISORY (LHA) LEVEL OF 70 PARTS PER TRILLION (PPT) FOR INDIVIDUAL OR COMBINED CONCENTRATIONS OF PFAS IN DRINKING WATER AND MANY STATES ARE ESTABLISHING EVEN LOWER LEVELS. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF PFAS IN HUMANS IS LINKED TO THYROID DISEASE, HIGH CHOLESTEROL, ULCERATIVE COLITIS, KIDNEY CANCER, TESTICULAR CANCER, AND PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION. CURRENT WATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN MEET THE EPA TARGETS ARE NOT COST EFFECTIVE, ESPECIALLY FOR IN-HOME USE, NECESSITATING A NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY/ADVANCED MATERIALS TO CLEANUP DRINKING WATER THAT ARE EFFICIENT, COST EFFECTIVE AND CAN MEET THE CURRENT EPA TARGET OF 70 PPT, THE NEW LOWER NEW YORK STATE LIMIT OF 10 PPT AND THE LIKELY EVEN STRICTER REGULATIONS THAT WILL FOLLOW. TDA RESEARCH, INC (TDA) PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AN ADSORPTION-BASED SYSTEM FOR REMOVING PFAS FROM DRINKING WATER DOWN TO EPA PRESCRIBED LIMITS OF 70 PPT (PARTS PER TRILLION) OR LOWER. THE KEY TO SUCH A SYSTEM IS A LOW COST, HIGH CAPACITY ADSORBENT WITH FAST KINETICS TO REMOVE PFAS. TDA'S SORBENT USES A MESOPOROUS CARBON STRUCTURE GRAFTED WITH LEWIS BASE FUNCTIONALIZED GROUPS TO REMOVE PFAS VIA PHYSICAL ADSORPTION. THE MESOPORES PROVIDES VERY FAST ADSORPTION KINETICS AND ACCESSIBILITY TO THE FUNCTIONALIZED ADSORPTION SITES. THE STRENGTH OF THE LEWIS ACID-BASE INTERACTION CAN BE TUNED TO ALLOW THE SORBENT TO BE EFFECTIVE EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MULTIPLE CONTAMINANTS FOUND IN DRINKING WATER. THE FAST ADSORPTION AND HIGH PFAS CAPACITY OF THE SORBENT WILL REDUCE THE SYSTEM SIZE AND ENABLE THEIR USE IN SMALLER HOME-BASED SYSTEMS. 14", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bc22aa27-9417-cfea-2afb-789cf5280d1c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44ES032735_7529"}, {"internal_id": 126271289, "Award ID": "R44ES032522", "Award Amount": 1929804.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-02-11", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "BARCODED HUMAN CELLS ENGINEERED WITH HETEROZYGOUS GENETIC DIVERSITY TO UNCOVER TOXICODYNAMIC VARIABILITY - PROJECT SUMMARY CURRENT IN VITRO APPROACHES FOR LABORATORY- AND CELL-BASED TOXICOLOGY STUDIES DO NOT CAPTURE THE INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY IN RESPONSES WITHIN THE HUMAN POPULATION.

THIS SBIR PROJECT IS DEVELOPING THE FIRST COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE TO OFFER TOOLS FOR GEOSTATISTICAL MULTIVARIATE SPACE- TIME (ST) INTERPOLATION AND MODELING OF UNCERTAINTY. THE RESEARCH PRODUCT WILL BE A STAND-ALONE DESKTOP ST TOOL, BUILDING ON THE LEGACY CORE SOFTWARE DEVELOPED BY BIOMEDWARE, AN ESRI PARTNER. THESE TOOLS WILL BE SUITED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DATA OUTSIDE HEALTH SCIENCES, SUCH AS IN REMOTE SENSING, GEOCHEMISTRY OR SOIL SCIENCE, BROADENING SIGNIFICANTLY THE COMMERCIAL MARKET FOR THE END PRODUCT. THIS PROJECT WILL ACCOMPLISH THREE AIMS:  REVIEW OF THE MAIN SPATIAL COREGIONALIZATION MODELS AVAILABLE IN THE GEOSTATISTICAL LITERATURE (I.E., TRADITIONAL  VS EXTENDED, INTRINSIC) AND THE COMPARISON OF THEIR PERFORMANCES (I.E., PREDICTION ACCURACY) AND USER-  FRIENDLINESS (I.E., EASE OF INFERENCE) FOR MULTIVARIATE SPATIAL INTERPOLATION. THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY AN  EXTENSION TO THE SPACE-TIME FRAMEWORK.

TRIHALOMETHANES (THMS) ARE THE MOST COMMON CLASS OF DBPS FORMED DURING WATER CHLORINATION. DESPITE THE THMS BEING REGULATED FOR 40 YEARS. MANY DRINKING WATER TREATMENT PLANTS (WTPS) STILL DO NOT HAVE AFFORDABLE, ON-SITE TOOLS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE. SUPERINTENDENTS AT THESE WTPS MAY ALLOCATE MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF THEIR OPERATING BUDGET FOR TREATMENT PROCESSES, WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION BEING DEVOTED FOR THM CONTROL STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, WITHOUT REAL-TIME THMS CONCENTRATION DATA, WTP OPERATORS BLINDLY ADJUST THE TREATMENT PROCESSES WHICH MAY LEAD TO INEFFICIENT PRACTICES AND HIGHER OPERATING COSTS. WHILE THERE ARE COMMERCIAL DEVICES FOR ON-SITE THMS MONITORING, THEY ARE NOT AFFORDABLE TO MOST WTPS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR VERY SMALL, SMALL, AND MANY MEDIUM SIZED UTILITIES. MANY OF THESE WTP ARE OFTEN RURAL AND LOCATED IN ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED REGIONS, BUT THEY ARE UNDER THE SAME REGULATIONS AS THEIR LARGER METROPOLITAN COUNTERPARTS. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED HERE WILL REVOLUTIONIZE WATER TREATMENT BY PROVIDING TO ALL WTPS THE ABILITY FOR AFFORDABLE, ON-SITE PROCESS CONTROL OF THMS.

BECAUSE TOXIC ENVIRONMENTS ARE LINKED DIRECTLY TO HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE, A CRITICAL NEED EXISTS TO EDUCATE THE AMERICAN POPULATION ON THIS RELATIONSHIP TO ALLOW US TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF RISK WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE. STATED DIFFERENTLY, TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH WE NEED TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH LITERACY (EHL), THE GOAL OF RFA-ES-21-008 (INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH LITERACY). THE RFA REQUESTS COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS \u201cTO DEVELOP NOVEL TOOLS, ACTIVITIES, OR MATERIALS TO BUILD EHL\u201d. IN RESPONSE, NZUMBE INC. HAS PARTNERED WITH MEDIA EXPERTS (SQUISHYMEDIA) ENVIRONMENTAL AND EDUCATION SCIENTISTS AT OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY AND LOCAL UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTIONS TO SUBMIT THIS PROPOSAL. OUR STRATEGY IS TO USE EPIGENETIC SCIENCE AS AN EDUCATION BRIDGE TO IMPROVE EHL BECAUSE THE BASICS OF THIS SCIENCE ARE RELATIVELY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND THE EPIGENOME RESPONDS TO ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES IN WAYS THAT CAN IMPROVE OR WORSEN HEALTH. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL, OUR SBIR PHASE I AND NOW OUR PHASE II APPLICATION FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING TWO \u201cEXPERIENTIAL\u201d EDUCATIONAL TOOLS. THE FIRST TOOL, DELIVERS INTERACTIVE LEARNING MODULES IN AN ONLINE SOFTWARE APPLICATION THAT UTILIZES \u201cGAMIFICATION\u201d PRINCIPLES TO TEACH USERS HOW THE ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS OUR EPIGENOME AND HEALTH AS A CONSEQUENCE.

TO COMPARE A LESS-COSTLY TRANSCRIPTIONAL READ-OUT, THE TEMPO-SEQ S1500 HUMAN PANEL, TO OUR RNA-SEQ DATA OBTAINED IN PHASE I ACTIVITIES AND TO VALIDATE A QPCR PANEL FOR PRODUCT RELEASE QUALITY CONTROL. 2) TO VALIDATE ORGANOIDS GENERATED ON OUR THIN HYDROGEL COATINGS TO ENABLE BETTER IMAGING OPTIONS, MICROELECTRODE ARRAY ANALYSIS AND LIQUID HANDLING AUTOMATION AND 3) VALIDATE MULTIPLEXED ASSAYS TO ASSESS MULTIPLE RESPONSES IN SINGLE WELLS INCLUDING MEA ANALYSIS, CYTOKINE AND LDH RELEASE AND HARVEST FOR TRANSCRIPT OR PROTEIN ANALYSIS. THIS WORK WILL LEAD TO THE FIRST COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE NEURAL ORGANOID CONTAINING VASCULAR CELLS AND MICROGLIA WITH BROAD APPLICABILITY IN BOTH TOXICOLOGY AND DRUG DISCOVERY MARKETS. .", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c37ab2a4-afe2-ee6e-e136-fcdad35ed11d-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44ES029898_7529"}, {"internal_id": 69725315, "Award ID": "R44ES029892", "Award Amount": 1709614.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-09-19", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED 4-ORGAN ANIMAL MODEL", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "26cb5c85-7967-d80a-ed61-ff24f55bd5e0-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44ES029892_7529"}, {"internal_id": 96998984, "Award ID": "R44ES029864", "Award Amount": 1550000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-04-23", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "INCORPORATING PHASE I/II DRUG/CHEMICAL METABOLISM IN HTS VIA MICRO SCALE CO-CULTURE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "73a39fd0-6d73-af98-e6f4-ea89060120d6-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44ES029864_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110233088, "Award ID": "R44ES029405", "Award Amount": 1220927.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-09", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "DEVELOPMENT OF A HANDHELD PEST-PEN DEVICE FOR THE RAPID DETECTION OF ORGANOPHOSPHATE INSECTICIDES ON FOOD AND CLOTHING", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "13160e53-7adc-2e89-9bd5-86fa2e7c40ff-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44ES029405_7529"}, {"internal_id": 83797556, "Award ID": "R44ES029401", "Award Amount": 999999.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-30", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "REMEDIATION OF PERFLUORINATED CHEMICALS IN WATER USING NOVEL HIGH-AFFINITY POLYMER ADSORBENTS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f80dda9d-bdcc-1a40-d252-ca60dad8370a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44ES029401_7529"}, {"internal_id": 62420149, "Award ID": "R44ES029014", "Award Amount": 1135816.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-02-09", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "NEXT GENERATION TESTING STRATEGIES FOR ASSESSMENT OF GENOTOXICITY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7fa87ac6-80d3-8256-2b6f-aa2cb549389d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44ES029014_7529"}, {"internal_id": 66995531, "Award ID": "R44ES029006", "Award Amount": 1396862.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-07-01", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "A BADGE-LIKE EXPOSURE DEVICE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AZ", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bf148559-7295-a25d-8a52-8b897965220e-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44ES029006_7529"}, {"internal_id": 149438497, "Award ID": "R44ES029001", "Award Amount": 827804.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-06-17", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "SWIFT.AI: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED PLATFORM FOR MACHINE-ASSISTED RESEARCH SYNTHESIS - PROJECT ABSTRACT (30 LINES OF TEXT)  1 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND EVIDENCE MAPPING, BOTH FORMS OF RESEARCH SYNTHESIS, ARE FORMAL, SEQUENTIAL PROCESSES  2 FOR IDENTIFYING, ASSESSING, AND INTEGRATING THE PRIMARY SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. THESE APPROACHES, ALREADY  3 CORNERSTONES OF EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE, HAVE RECENTLY GAINED SIGNIFICANT POPULARITY IN SEVERAL OTHER  4 DISCIPLINES INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL, AGRICULTURAL, AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH AND ARE INCREASINGLY UTILIZED FOR  5 INFORMED DECISION MAKING BY GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN 25,000  6 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED AND PUBLISHED ANNUALLY AND SELECTING STUDIES FOR INCLUSION IS ONE OF THE MOST  7 RESOURCE INTENSIVE STEPS FOR ANY SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OR EVIDENCE MAP. IN PHASE I OF OUR RESEARCH PLAN, WE HAVE  8 DEVELOPED A WEB-BASED, COLLABORATIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WEB APPLICATION CALLED SWIFT-ACTIVE SCREENER, AN  9 INNOVATIVE DOCUMENT SCREENING TOOL THAT ALLOWS USERS TO IDENTIFY THE MAJORITY OF RELEVANT ARTICLES AFTER SCREENING 10 ONLY A FRACTION OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ABSTRACTS. OUR GOAL FOR THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL 11 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED TO MAKE SWIFT-ACTIVE SCREENER A COMMERCIAL SUCCESS, WHILE ALSO 12 BUILDING ON AND LEVERAGING METHODS AND SOFTWARE WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY BUILT TO ADDRESS OTHER STAGES IN THE 13 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PIPELINE.

THIS SHIFT INCLUDES A REDUCTION, OR IN SOME CASES ELIMINATION, OF TRADITIONAL TOXICITY TESTING IN ANIMALS WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW APPROACH METHODOLOGIES (NAMS). ALTHOUGH THESE EMERGING NAMS PROVIDE AN ATTRACTIVE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING TERATOGENS AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICANTS, THE ABSENCE OF A QUANTITATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR RELATING IN VITRO EFFECTS TO EQUIVALENT IN VIVO HUMAN EXPOSURES LIMITS THEIR USE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. HERE, WE DEVELOP A TIERED APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES EXISTING PHARMACOKINETIC MODELS FOR PREGNANCY INTO A COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATION THAT CAN BE ADAPTED TO CURRENT AND EMERGING NAMS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO DELIVER AN OUT-OF-THE-BOX COMPUTATIONAL SOLUTION FOR PREDICTING THE DOSE-RESPONSE OF POSSIBLE HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS BY PERFORMING IN VITRO-TO-IN VIVO EXTRAPOLATION (IVIVE). IN SPECIFIC AIM 1, WE WILL DESIGN A WEB BASED COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATION, DRIIVE FOR THE DEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE IN VITRO TO IN VIVO EXTRAPOLATION, THAT WILL PERFORM FORWARD- OR REVERSE-DOSIMETRY USING PHYSIOLOGICALLY BASED PHARMACOKINETIC (PBPK) MODELING WITHIN A TIERED FRAMEWORK BRIDGING MULTIPLE LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY. THIS FRAMEWORK WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER ACCOUNT FOR CHEMICAL SPACE AND EXPOSURE ROUTES RELEVANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS. IN SPECIFIC AIM 2, THE WORK WILL CULMINATE IN A CASE STUDY TO TAKE INDUSTRY-RELEVANT COMPOUNDS THROUGH THE DEFINED IVIVE WORKFLOWS AND COMPARE THE OUTCOMES TO IN-LIFE DATA. OUR PROPOSAL WILL REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON CURRENT IN VIVO DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY AND PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED FRAMEWORK FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF CHEMICAL SAFETY ASSESSMENT.

DUE TO THE CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN DILI AND DRUG FAILURE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR IMPROVED HUMAN HEPATOTOXICITY TESTING IN THE EARLY STAGE OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT BY INVESTIGATING THE MAJOR PATHOGENIC MECHANISMS OF DILI, SUCH AS GENETIC VARIATIONS IN DRUG METABOLIZING ENZYMES (DMES) AND DRUG TRANSPORTERS. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP GENETICALLY ENGINEERED HUMAN LIVER ORGANOIDS (HLOS) ON A PILLAR/PERFUSION PLATE USING GENE-EDITED, INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL (IPSC) LINES CARRYING CRISPR/CAS9 SYNERGISTIC ACTIVATION MEDIATOR (CRISPR-SAM), INDUCIBLE CSY4, AND MULTIPLEXED GUIDE RNA (GRNA), AND RECAPITULATE POOR AND ULTRAFAST DRUG METABOLIZERS IN DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS.

CURRENTLY, THE ADVISORY LEVEL SET BY THE US EPA SET FOR PFOS AND PFOA IN DRINKING WATER IS 70 PPT (0.14 AND 0.17 NM FOR PFOS AND PFOA). CURRENT DETECTION OF PFAS IS MOSTLY BASED ON LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED WITH MASS SPECTROMETRY (LC-MS). HOWEVER, THE COSTS, FOOTPRINT, POWER REQUIREMENTS, AND SAMPLE PREPARATION PROCESSES OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE LC-MS TECHNOLOGIES LIMIT THEIR DEPLOYMENT BEYOND THE FORMAL LABORATORY SETTING. ESPECIALLY FOR THE DETECTION OF NANOMOLAR LEVELS OF PFAS, LC-MS USUALLY REQUIRES A PRECONCENTRATION FRONTEND DEVICE, MAKING THE ANALYSIS EVEN MORE TIME-CONSUMING. IT BECOMES IMPERATIVE TO DEVELOP A RAPID, SIMPLE, AND LOW-COST SENSOR TECHNOLOGY THAT IS MORE SUITED FOR QUICK ONSITE DETECTION OF PFAS. WHILE MANY CHEMICAL SENSORS, SUCH AS THOSE BASED ON FLUORESCENCE MODULATION, HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE DETECTION OF PFAS, MOST OF THEM ARE STILL FAR FROM SUFFICIENT FOR POTABLE WATER ANALYSIS REGARDING EITHER SENSITIVITY (VS. 70 PPT) OR SELECTIVITY (AGAINST THE COMMON CHEMICALS, ESPECIALLY DETERGENTS). THIS PROJECT AIMS TO FILL THIS TECHNICAL GAP BY DEVELOPING A UNIQUE SENSOR PLATFORM THAT IS SMALL AND EASY TO USE, OFFERING SENSITIVE AND SELECTIVE INFIELD DETECTION OF PFOS AND PFOA (SELECTED AS THE REPRESENTATIVE PFAS ANALYTES). THE SENSOR PLATFORM IS BASED ON HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SELECTIVE FLUORESCENCE SENSORS COATED ONTO SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION (SPE) CAPABLE OF PRECONCENTRATION OF LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF ANALYSES, THUS LOWERING THE DETECTION LIMIT. THE COMBINATION OF PRECONCENTRATION OF SPE AND FLUORESCENCE DETECTION IN ONE PLATFORM (NAMELY F-SPE) WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY SIMPLIFY AND SPEED UP THE ANALYSIS PROCESS. MOREOVER, F-SPE TAKES THE PRINCIPLE OF NEGLIGIBLE DEPLETION (ND) INTRINSIC TO SPE, WHICH WOULD FURTHER SIMPLIFY THE ANALYSIS PROCESS BY ELIMINATING THE NEED TO PRECISELY METER THE SAMPLE VOLUME AS TYPICALLY REQUIRED FOR CONVENTIONAL ANALYTICAL METHODS. ND RELIES ON PASSING THE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF SAMPLE THROUGH THE MEMBRANE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE ANALYTE EXTRACTION TO REACH EQUILIBRIUM. AT THIS POINT, THE ANALYTE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE SAMPLE ENTERING AND EXITING THE MEMBRANE ARE EQUAL. AS A RESULT, THE SURFACE CONCENTRATION OF THE ANALYTE CAN BE DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO ITS CONCENTRATION IN THE SAMPLE BUT IS NO LONGER DEPENDENT ON THE VOLUME OF THE SAMPLE PASSED THROUGH THE MEMBRANE. THEREFORE, IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO METER AN EXACT SAMPLE VOLUME THROUGH THE MEMBRANE. THE MAIN INNOVATION HEREIN LIES IN INTEGRATING THE HIGH SENSITIVITY AND SELECTIVITY OF FLUORESCENCE SENSORS WITH THE PRECONCENTRATION CAPABILITY AND ND PRINCIPLE OF SPE, WHICH WILL ENABLE QUICK, RELIABLE DETECTION OF PFAS IN A SIMPLE, LOW-COST WAY. THE PROJECT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AROUND THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: SPECIFIC AIM 1. SYNTHESIS AND SURFACE IMMOBILIZATION OF FLUOROPHORES SELECTIVE TO EITHER PFOS OR PFOA TO IN-HOUSE FABRICATED SPE DISKS.

ELEGANS POPULATIONS - ABSTRACT: DEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY (DART) STUDIES ARE COMMONLY CONDUCTED USING A LARGE NUMBER OF GENETICALLY INBRED RODENT AND RABBIT STRAINS TO PREDICT ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CHEMICALS ON HUMAN HEALTH. WHILE IN VITRO OR EX VIVO METHODS ARE USED IN EARLY DRUG DISCOVERY FIELDS, THEY FACE SEVERAL CHALLENGES FOR DART STUDIES DUE TO LACK OF SYSTEM-LEVEL BIOLOGY, MULTI-ORGAN PHYSIOLOGY, AND MALE/FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. C. ELEGANS IS A GENETICALLY AND MOLECULARLY ATTRACTIVE MODEL ORGANISM THAT PROVIDES MANY ADVANTAGES FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT DART STUDIES, INCLUDING A HIGH DEGREE OF CONSERVED GENES AND BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS, A WELL-DEFINED AND CHARACTERIZED REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, A RAPID LIFE AND REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE, AND LOW MAINTENANCE COSTS. WHILE C. ELEGANS BASED ASSAYS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENT WITH HIGHER MAMMALS (RAT AND RABBIT), THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR MORE SENSITIVE ASSAYS TO IMPROVE BOTH SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FOR WIDE ACCEPTANCE OF C. ELEGANS AS AN ALTERNATIVE ANIMAL MODEL FOR DART TESTING. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FIRST C. ELEGANS BASED HIGH-CONTENT DART ASSAY TO ANALYZE MULTIPLE PHENOTYPES THAT WILL REDUCE FALSE NEGATIVES AND CAPTURE INTERINDIVIDUAL TOXICOLOGY RESPONSES FROM A PANEL OF GENETICALLY DIVERSE STRAINS. NEWORMICS\u2019 VIVOCHIP TECHNOLOGY IS THE ONLY SCREENING PLATFORM THAT CAN PROVIDE HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING OF C. ELEGANS STRAINS AT HIGH THROUGHPUTS.

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

PFAS ARE EMERGING ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS IN GROUNDWATER, AND THEY ARE ATTRACTING SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION DUE TO THEIR GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION, PERSISTENCE, TOXICITY AND TENDENCY TO BIO-ACCUMULATE. PFAS CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN FOUND IN MORE THAN 1400 LOCATIONS IN 49 STATES AND THE EPA ESTIMATES THAT THE DRINKING WATER OF MORE THAN 110 MILLION AMERICANS MAY ALREADY BE CONTAMINATED. ONCE RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, THEY ARE NOT EASILY BROKEN DOWN BY AIR, WATER, OR SUNLIGHT. THUS, PEOPLE CAN BE EXPOSED TO PFAS THAT WERE MANUFACTURED MONTHS OR YEARS IN THE PAST. PFAS CAN TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES IN THE AIR AND WATER, EXPOSING PEOPLE TO PFAS MANUFACTURED OR EMITTED FROM FACILITIES MANY MILES AWAY.

IN 2005, MAYNARD AND KUEMPEL CONCLUDED THAT PARTICLE TOXICITY INCREASES WITH DECREASING PARTICLE DIAMETER AND INCREASING TOTAL PARTICLE SURFACE AREA, THUS CHALLENGING MASS-BASED RISK EVALUATION APPROACHES. LUNG DEPOSITED SURFACE AREA (LDSA), 99% OF WHICH IS DUE TO PARTICLES BELOW 300 NM, HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A BETTER METRIC TO RELATE PM EXPOSURES TO ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. ATTENTION HAS ALSO BEEN PAID TO RELATING MASS CONCENTRATIONS OF ULTRAFINE PARTICLES (PM0.1, PARTICLES LOWER THAN 0.1\u039cM) AS A BETTER HEALTH METRIC.

MAPPING OF AIR POLLUTANTS USING RIDESHARE AND OTHER VEHICLES - PROJECT SUMMARY  THE WORK WE ARE PROPOSING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GREATLY ENHANCE OUR CAPABILITY TO ASSESS HUMAN EXPOSURES TO HARMFUL AIR POLLUTANTS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AND FIELD TEST A ROBUST CARTOP AIR POLLUTION MONITORING PACKAGE FOR MOUNTING ON VEHICLES OF OPPORTUNITY SUCH AS RIDESHARE (E.G., UBER, LYFT) DELIVERY VEHICLES (E.G., FEDEX, UPS, USPS) AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (E.G., BUSES, TRAMS). OUR APPROACH OF USING RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE AIR POLLUTANT SENSORS IN THE MONITORING PACKAGE, COMBINED WITH DRIVE-BY CALIBRATIONS OF THESE SENSORS AT FIXED STATIONS HAVING MORE SOPHISTICATED AIR MONITORING INSTRUMENTS, OPTIMIZES THE PRECISION AND ACCURACY OF THE SENSOR MEASUREMENTS WHILE\u2014VERY IMPORTANTLY\u2014PROVIDING AN ECONOMICAL PATH FOR EVENTUAL WIDESPREAD USE. THIS APPROACH WOULD ENABLE A NEW PARADIGM FOR AIR POLLUTION MONITORING THAT PRODUCES HIGH-RESOLUTION MAPPING OF AIR POLLUTANTS WITHIN CITIES, TOWNS, AND RURAL AREAS WITH THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION NEEDED FOR DETERMINING ACTUAL EXPOSURES OF INDIVIDUALS TO SPECIFIC AIR POLLUTANTS. THIS NEW CAPABILITY WOULD OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT AIR POLLUTION MONITORING NETWORK, WHICH USES RELATIVELY SPARSE FIXED-BASE MEASUREMENT STATIONS THAT ARE LOCATED SO AS TO PROVIDE AVERAGE CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE USEFUL FOR DETERMINING COMPLIANCE WITH EPA AIR QUALITY STANDARDS, BUT CANNOT PROVIDE THE DETAIL NEEDED FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT. IN THIS WORK WE WILL DEVELOP A COMPACT, EASY-TO-INSTALL ENCLOSURE THAT WILL MOUNT ON THE ROOFTOPS OF VEHICLES. THE ENCLOSURE WILL HOUSE THE PERSONAL AIR MONITOR (PAM) WE DEVELOPED IN A PREVIOUS NIH/NIEHS GRANT. THE PAM MAKES USE OF LOW-COST, LOW-POWER SENSORS THAT WE HAVE EVALUATED AS THE MOST ROBUST ON THE MARKET TODAY FOR MEASURING THE AIR POLLUTANTS CO, CO2 AND PARTICULATES (PM1 AND PM2.5). WE PROPOSE NEW INNOVATIONS, FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECENTLY FILED PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATIONS, FOR WEATHERPROOFING AND POWERING THE PAM IN THE ENCLOSURE WHILE CAUSING MINIMAL INCONVENIENCE FOR THE VEHICLE DRIVER. WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE DENVER CITY AND COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT TO FIELD TEST THE USE OF THE AIR MONITORING PACKAGE ON 5 SERVICE VEHICLES OVER A PERIOD OF 3 MONTHS. DATA FROM THE FIELD TEST WILL BE TRANSMITTED VIA AN LTE MODULE FOR CELLULAR UPLOADING TO A PUBLIC DATABASE. WE WILL ANALYZE THE RESULTS TO EVALUATE: (1) THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE CARTOP ENCLOSURE DURING ROUTINE EXTENDED USE AND IN WEATHER EVENTS; (2) PERFORMANCE OF THE SENSORS; (3) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRIVE-BY CALIBRATION PROTOCOL; (4) THE QUALITY OF THE DATA OBTAINED; AND (5) THE ABILITY OF NON- SPECIALISTS TO FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES AND USE THE ROOFTOP AIR MONITORING SYSTEM EFFECTIVELY. THE PROPOSED WORK ADDRESSES HEALTH NEEDS OF THE U.S., WHERE 43% OF THE POPULATION RESIDES IN COUNTIES THAT HAVE UNHEALTHY LEVELS OF ONE OR MORE AIR POLLUTANTS; GLOBALLY, 4.2 MILLION PREMATURE DEATHS PER YEAR ARE LINKED TO AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION. CONTINUOUS MONITORING BY HUNDREDS OF VEHICLES WITHIN A CITY WOULD ALLOW CREATION OF REAL-TIME AIR POLLUTION MAPS THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR IDENTIFYING MAJOR SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTANTS AND FOR TRAFFIC PLANNING TO MINIMIZE AIR POLLUTION.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATRICES (PHASE I) - ABSTRACT  POLYFLUORO- AND PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFAS) ARE A GROUP OF HIGHLY FLUORINATED ALKANES. MEMBERS OF THIS FAMILY ARE KNOWN TO BE PERSISTENT AND BIOACCUMULATIVE. PFAS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH UNFAVORABLE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN HUMAN AND ANIMAL MODELS. SEVERAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AS WELL AS SCIENTISTS HAVE PUBLISHED ARTICLES THAT INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF PFAS IN HUMAN BLOOD, SERUM, MILK, CORD BLOOD, AND TISSUES. CURRENTLY, DETECTION OF ABOUT A DOZEN OF THESE CHEMICALS OUT OF MORE THAN A THOUSAND OF THIS CLASS IS PERFORMED USING LCMS/MS. HOWEVER, PRIOR TO ANALYSIS MANY PURIFICATION STEPS ARE REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE INTERFERING SPECIES. FURTHERMORE, THE NECESSITY OF INTERNAL STANDARDS FOR THE DETECTION OF PFAS, AND THE LACK OF PERTINENT INTERNAL STANDARDS DRAMATICALLY REDUCES THE SCOPE OF PFAS-DETECTION. CURRENTLY, PFAS TESTING IS A LENGTHY AND COSTLY UNDERTAKING THAT REPRESENTS A MAJOR SCIENTIFIC BOTTLENECK. THUS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR A REAL-TIME DETECTION TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN SENSE A BROAD RANGE OF PFAS WITHOUT PRETREATMENT OF SAMPLE, OR EXPENSIVE INSTRUMENTATION. IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH A PRODUCT WILL ALLOW BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE FATE OF PFAS WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH.  THIS PROPOSAL\u2019S OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP THE PRE-TREATMENT FREE DETECTION OF PFAS IN ENVIRONMENTAL MATRICES BY COUPLING THE KEY FLUOROUS PHASE PROPERTY WITH A HIGHLY SENSITIVE FLUORESCENCE TECHNOLOGY. IN PHASE 1, WE WILL APPLY THE SPECIFIC FLUOROUS-FLUOROUS INTERACTION STRATEGY TO PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE SELECTIVITY TO PRECLUDE ANY ASSOCIATED PURIFICATION STEPS. FLUOROUS TETHERED FLUORESCENT DYES WILL BE COVALENTLY IMMOBILIZED ON A GLASS SURFACE. INITIALLY, PRIOR TO EXPOSURE TO PFAS, THESE FLUORESCENT DYES WILL EXIST AS EXCIMERS RESULTING FROM THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER, THE FLUORESCENT PROBE TURNS THE FLUORESCENCE ON. UPON EXPOSURE TO PFAS ANALYTES, THE ANALYTES WILL BE SEQUESTERED TO THE FLUOROUS REGION OF THE PROBE DUE TO SPECIFIC FLUOROUS-FLUOROUS AFFINITY. THIS WILL CAUSE A PHYSICAL DISRUPTION OF THE EXCIMERS, RESULTING IN THE FLUORESCENCE TURN OFF OF THE EXCIMER AND A SIMULTANEOUS TURN ON OF THE MONOMER EMISSION. TO ACHIEVE THE PROPOSED GOAL, IN PHASE I THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BE PURSUED: SPECIFIC AIM1: 1) ATTACHMENT OF THE FLUORESCENT DYE TO THE FLUOROUS MOLECULE, 2) IMMOBILIZATION OF FLUOROUS-DYE ARRAY ON GLASS SURFACE, AND 3) EVALUATION OF FLUORESCENCE ON-OFF OF FLUOROUS-DYE GLASS SURFACE WITH PFAS-SAMPLES. ULTIMATELY THE APPROACH DEVELOPED HERE WILL LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRODUCT THAT IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCHERS TO STUDY MANY TYPES OF EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH CAUSED BY PFAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OK", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "06cd2f1a-c152-b7a4-82b1-99f00f2551b9-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43ES030677_7529"}, {"internal_id": 80725139, "Award ID": "R43ES030662", "Award Amount": 149999.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-04-26", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "COMPOSITE INTEGRATIVE PASSIVE SAMPLER (CIPS)", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "107716fe-fbc7-cbe5-f1f5-b993a658b7d0-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43ES030662_7529"}, {"internal_id": 80401601, "Award ID": "R43ES030652", "Award Amount": 218900.45, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-04-26", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "MICROFLUIDIC NASAL EPITHELIAL ALI MODEL TO EVALUATE INHALATIONTOXICITY CAUSED BY ENGINEERED NANOMATERIALS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3508fc93-1cae-ec76-51db-0687a2422381-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43ES030652_7529"}, {"internal_id": 80734555, "Award ID": "R43ES030650", "Award Amount": 149993.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-04-26", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "NANOSAFE TESTED?

PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT COMBINES THE COLLECTION AND CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF ULTRAFINE PARTICLES USING AN IN-SITU MULTISPECTRAL TECHNIQUE. THE SAMPLE, COLLECTED DIRECTLY ONTO THE ANALYSIS SUBSTRATE, IS ANALYZED VIA EXCITATION-EMISSION MATRIX (EEM) SPECTROSCOPY. THIS APPROACH WILL BE VALIDATED AGAINST LABORATORY COMBUSTION-GENERATED AEROSOLS, SUCH AS DIESEL EXHAUST, WOOD SMOKE, TOBACCO SMOKE, AND AGAINST A MIXTURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS. WITHIN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT, PARTICLE SIZE DETERMINES THE REGION OF DEPOSITION AND TISSUE UPTAKE; THE CHEMISTRY OF THE PARTICLE ALSO AFFECTS SOLUBILITY AND DETERMINES THE POTENTIAL FOR BIOCHEMICAL REACTION WITH TISSUES AND CELLS. THERE IS A GROWING AWARENESS THAT EXPOSURE SCENARIOS ARE VERY COMPLEX, CONSISTING OF TIME-VARYING CONCENTRATIONS AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OVER A BROAD RANGE OF PARTICLE SIZES. LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION HAS ALSO BEEN LINKED TO INCREASED MORTALITY RATES FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING COVID-19. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR IMPROVED PERSONAL EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ULTRAFINE PARTICLES IN THE ENVIRONMENT. LOW-COST, MINIATURIZED EXPOSURE MONITORING DEVICES CAN SHED INSIGHT INTO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO POLLUTANTS AND HEALTH IMPACT. SOURCE APPORTIONED MEASUREMENTS OF PM CONCENTRATION WITH HIGH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION CAN FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTIMAL AIR POLLUTION MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE ANTICIPATED OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MINIATURIZED SPECTROSCOPIC SENSOR THAT PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF COMBUSTION-GENERATED ULTRAFINE PARTICLES, WHICH BOTH REFLECTS THE PARTICLE SOURCES AND DETERMINES THEIR TOXIC POTENTIAL. THE MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS WILL ENABLE THE DECONVOLUTION OF THE COMPLEX SPECTRA AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE PM SOURCE FROM THE EEM ANALYSIS.

CURRENT STANDARDS FOR DNT TESTING REQUIRE USE OF ANIMAL MODELS WITH LIMITED THROUGHPUT AND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FROM HUMAN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) DEVELOPMENT. AS SUCH, MANY CHEMICAL PRODUCTS HAVE REQUIRED POST-APPROVAL (EPA/FDA) RESTRICTIONS OR CANCELLATIONS DUE TO HUMAN DNT. SUCH LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT REGULATORY DNT TESTING PARADIGM HAVE PROMPTED INCREASED INTEREST IN QUANTITATIVE HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING (QHTS) USING HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL (HPSC)-BASED APPROACHES. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO USE ROSETTE ARRAY (RA) TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AN HPSC- DERIVED QHTS PLATFORM (I.E., QHTS-RAS) FOR EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT DNT TESTING. ROSETTE ARRAY TECHNOLOGY STANDARDIZES IN VITRO DERIVATION OF HUMAN NEURAL ROSETTES TISSUES THAT ARE MIMETIC OF TRANSVERSE SLICES OF THE HUMAN NEURAL TUBE, THE ANLAGE OF ALL CNS TISSUE. ALTHOUGH NEURAL ROSETTES ARE NOT AN EXACT RECAPITULATION OF IN VIVO PRIMARY NEURULATION, THEY EXHIBIT THE SAME CELL PHENOTYPES, TISSUE CYTOARCHITECTURE, AND ARE DERIVED USING MORPHOGENETIC SIGNALING PATHWAYS ENDOGENOUS TO THE IN VIVO NEURAL TUBE FORMATION PROCESS. ROSETTE ARRAYS ARE THE FIRST IN VITRO TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CONTROL OF NEURAL ROSETTE EMERGENCE IN A MICROARRAY FORMAT. THIS ENABLES RAPID ASSESSMENT VIA MICROSCOPE IMAGE ANALYSIS. THIS HIGH-YIELD, STANDARDIZED GENERATION OF IN VITRO NEURAL TUBE ANALOGS ENABLES THE REPEATABILITY NECESSARY TO FEASIBLY INCORPORATE HPSC-BASED CNS MORPHOGENIC READOUTS INTO QUANTITATIVE HIGH-THROUGHPUT TOXICOLOGY SCREENING. THUS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE QHTS-RA PLATFORM COULD INCREASE THROUGHPUT AND ACCURACY OF HUMAN DNT RISK ASSESSMENT, ALLOWING CONSOLIDATION AND SCALE-UP OF COMMERCIAL DNT SCREENING. PHASE 1 AIMS WILL VALIDATE THE BROAD APPLICABILITY OF THE QHTS-RA PLATFORM, CONFIRMING COMPATIBILITY WITH HUMAN INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL (HIPSC) LINES AND ESTABLISHING METHODS FOR AUTOMATED IMAGE ACQUISITION AND BATCH ANALYSIS. PHASE 2 AIMS TO VALIDATE ASSAY FITNESS WITH A 100 COMPOUND DNT REFERENCE LIBRARY SCREEN, IN WHICH AUTOMATED AI IMAGE ANALYSIS IS UTILIZED TO FURTHER INCREASE ACCURACY AND MAXIMIZE THROUGHPUT. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE RESULTING QHTS-RA PLATFORM COULD REPLACE MULTIPLE CURRENT DNT ASSAYS AND INCREASE CONFIDENCE IN TOXICOLOGICAL READOUTS RELEVANT TO OUTCOMES UNIQUE TO HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY.

WHEN THE SKIN BARRIER IS BREACHED BY UV IRRADIATION (UVR) OR TOXIC CHEMICALS, LIVING CELL LAYERS INCLUDING EPIDERMAL KERATINOCYTES, MELANOCYTES AND DERMAL FIBROBLASTS ARE SUBJECTED TO DNA DAMAGE. IF UNREPAIRED, THIS DAMAGE CAN LEAD TO PHOTOAGING AND CUTANEOUS CARCINOGENESIS. IN FACT, SKIN CANCER IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON MALIGNANCY, ACCOUNTING FOR MORE CASES OF CANCER IN THE US AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAN ALL OTHER ORGANS COMBINED. SUNSCREENS HAVE BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY WITH SOME SUCCESS, BUT NEWER CHEMICAL FILTERS SUFFER FROM SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS THAT MAKE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE PRODUCTS UNDESIRABLE, AND CAN BE A RISK TO HUMAN HEALTH. CURRENT STRATEGIES THAT EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF ORGANIC UV FILTERS NEED TO BE REASSESSED. THESE NEW STRATEGIES SHOULD TEST THE BIOLOGY OF UVR IN THE PRESENCE OF SUNSCREENS. FURTHER, THEY NEED TO BE HIGH-THROUGHPUT (HTP) IN ORDER TO EXAMINE COMBINATIONS OF DIFFERENT CHEMICAL BLOCKERS THAT ARE PRESENT IN MOST FORMULATIONS, WORK IN CULTURED CELLS FOR EASE OF SCREENING, AND BE ANIMAL-FRIENDLY. IN PHASE I WE SHOWED PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE FOR A NOVEL UVR HTP SCREENING PLATFORM CALLED \u201cUVALIDATE, EMPLOYING MIXED POPULATIONS OF ISOGENIC KERATINOCYTES AND MELANOCYTES DERIVED FROM A SINGLE DONOR, EXPOSED TO TWO-COMPOUND COMBINATIONS OF SUNSCREEN ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF SHORT WAVE (UVB; 285-320), AND LONG WAVE SOLAR UVR (UVA1; 340-400 NM). THESE SCREENS MEASURE REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS), DNA DAMAGE (CPDS), AND MICRONUCLEI AND SHOW A COMPLEX INTERPLAY BETWEEN SOLAR UV WAVELENGTH, SUNSCREEN BLOCKERS, AND CELL TYPES. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE PRESSING NEED FOR OUR PLATFORM, COMPARED TO CURRENTLY-UTILIZED ASSAYS THAT MEASURE ONLY THE AMOUNT OF UV THAT IS BLOCKED BY SPECTROMETRY. IN THE PROPOSED PHASE II, WE PLAN TO TEST KNOWN CHEMICAL UV BLOCKERS FOR THE COSMETIC AND SKIN-CARE MARKETS AS A CONTRACTING SERVICE, USING A PANEL OF DONOR-DERIVED ISOGENIC KERATINOCYTES, MELANOCYTES AND FIBROBLAST. AT THE COMPLETION OF PHASE II, IF FUNDED, UVALIDATE WILL BE OFFERED AS A SERVICE PARTICULARLY SUITED FOR COMPANIES AT THE EARLY STAGES OF DRUG DISCOVERY, REGULATORY BODIES AND ESTABLISHED PHARMA SEEKING TO OPTIMIZE FORMULATION. ADVANCES IN THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE FLUORO-TAGGING ISOGENIC PATIENT CELL LINES, ESTABLISHING 2D AND 3D CELL CULTURES TO DETERMINE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES TO SOLAR UV IRRADIATION, UTILIZATION OF REAGENTS AND ASSAYS TO RAPIDLY DETERMINE THE TYPES OF DNA LESIONS AND THEIR REPAIR, AND DESIGN OF AI SOFTWARE TO MORE ACCURATELY DETERMINE DAMAGE. CONTROL CELLS, GENERATED USING CRISPR TECHNOLOGY, WILL REPRODUCE DNA REPAIR-COMPROMISED SKIN CELLS AND 3D SKIN EQUIVALENTS WILL ALSO BE INCLUDED TO ENSURE EXPERIMENTAL RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY. THE PRESENT CRISIS DUE TO THE LACK OF NON- TOXIC SUNSCREENS HAS LED TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, BANNING OF SUNSCREENS IN GROWING NUMBERS WORLDWIDE, AND RECALL OF FORMULATIONS FROM THE MARKET.

DISEASE WORLDWIDE AFTER ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE (AD). IN ADDITION TO AGE AND GENETIC BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PD. AGENTS IMPLICATED AS RISK FACTORS FOR PD INCLUDE PESTICIDES AND HEAVY METALS, AS WELL AS INFECTIOUS AGENTS SUCH AS BACTERIA AND VIRUSES. THE QUESTION OF HOW CUMULATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE TO THESE AGENTS THROUGHOUT LIFESPAN CAN PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PD AND RELATED DISORDERS REMAINS LARGELY UNANSWERED. INFLAMMATORY ACTIVATION OF GLIAL CELLS IN THE BRAIN IS RECOGNIZED AS A CRITICAL EARLY EVENT IN THE PRODROMAL PHASE OF PD. STILL, THE MOLECULAR SIGNALS REGULATING CONVERSION TO THIS DAMAGING INFLAMMATORY PHENOTYPE ARE ONLY NOW BEING ELUCIDATED. THIS R35/RIVER APPLICATION ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL QUESTION OF HOW THE NEURO-IMMUNE AXIS RESPONDS TO ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES ENCOUNTERED ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND HOW THE COMBINATION OF SUCH EXPOSURES CAN TRIGGER THE ONSET OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE THROUGH PHENOTYPIC CONVERSION OF GLIAL CELLS TO A NEUROTOXIC STATE. TO DEVELOP A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR REGULATION OF PHENOTYPIC CHANGES IN GLIAL CELLS THAT UNDERLIE THE PROGRESSION FROM PRODROMAL TO SYMPTOMATIC DISEASE, THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL EMPLOY SOPHISTICATED TRANSGENIC MODELS AND MOLECULAR TOOLS TO ADDRESS THESE SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS. THE KEY SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS RAISED IN THIS APPLICATION COALESCE AROUND THREE WELL DEFINED AND INTERRELATED GOALS: 1) DETERMINE HOW DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL NEUROTOXINS MODULATES INNATE IMMUNE SIGNALING IN GLIAL CELLS TO ALTER THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE OF THE NEURO-IMMUNE AXIS TO SUBSEQUENT TOXIC EXPOSURES DURING AGING, 2) IDENTIFY KEY MOLECULAR PATHWAYS IN GLIAL CELLS ALTERED BY EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL NEUROTOXICANTS THAT REGULATE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES OF THE BRAIN TO VIRAL INFECTION, AND 3) ELUCIDATE MOLECULAR SIGNATURES IN REGIONAL POPULATIONS OF GLIAL CELLS CORRESPONDING TO VARIOUS STATES OF ACTIVATION ACROSS THE PROGRESSION OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE TRIGGERED BY EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL NEUROTOXICANTS AND VIRUSES. THE SCIENTIFIC GOALS ADDRESSED BY THIS R35/RIVER APPLICATION CONCERNING MULTIPLE EXPOSURES ACROSS LIFESPAN AND RISK FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE WILL USE BOTH LONG-TERM STUDIES INVOLVING EXPOSURE TO MULTIPLE NEUROTOXIC AND INFECTIOUS AGENTS, AS WELL AS POWERFUL APPROACHES SUCH AS HIGH-CONTENT IMAGING, NEURAL NETWORK-BASED INFORMATIC ANALYSIS, SINGLE-CELL AND SPATIAL TRANSCRIPTOMICS AND GENERATION OF NEW TRANSGENIC MODELS.

CAREFUL AND RIGOROUS EXPERIMENTATION TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THE MICROBIOTA INFLUENCES ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL EXPOSURE WILL LEAD TO A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE CHEMICALS DISRUPT THE HOST- MICROBIOTA INTERACTION AND WILL GENERATE NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE KEY SIGNALING PATHWAYS UNDERLYING THOSE PERTURBATIONS AND ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. IMPORTANTLY, STUDIES OF THE MICROBIOTA AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS MAY PROVIDE KEY INSIGHTS THAT WILL BETTER INFORM RISK ASSESSMENT THAT COULD POSITIVELY IMPACT HUMAN HEALTH. IN THIS R35 RIVER PROPOSAL, WE PLAN TO WORK ACROSS THREE INNOVATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY THEMES TO ADDRESS THE UNIFYING HYPOTHESIS THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL EXPOSURE PERTURBS THE HOST-GUT MICROBIOTA INTERACTION TO ADVERSELY AFFECT HEALTH.

MY PRIMARY FOCUS WILL BE ON THE EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION ON ACCELERATED BRAIN AGING, A MAJOR INTEREST OF MY LAB. AMBIENT AIR PARTICULATE POLLUTION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HASTEN COGNITIVE AGING BY AS MUCH AS 5 YEARS. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG AGE DEPENDENCE OF DEMENTIA, MERELY DELAYING ITS ONSET COULD HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT. FOR EFFECTIVELY PREVENTING SUCH EFFECTS, WE NEED TO DEVELOP BIOMARKERS THAT REFLECT NOT ONLY ADVERSE EXPOSURES, BUT ALSO PRECLINICAL EFFECTS ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND BRAIN HEALTH DETERIORATION. THAT IS, WE NEED TO FIND EASY-TO-USE TOOLS TO DETECT THE IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION AND THE BEGINNINGS OF COGNITIVE DECLINE BEFORE THEY MANIFEST FULLY. TO ADDRESS THIS URGENT CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH NEED, I PROPOSE A SERIES OF COORDINATED HUMAN AND IN VITRO STUDIES OF AN UNDERAPPRECIATED CELLULAR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ENABLED BY EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES (EVS). EVS ARE NANO-SIZED (0.05\u20131 \u039cM) MEMBRANE-BOUND VESICLES RELEASED BY HUMAN CELLS INTO THE BLOODSTREAM THAT CONTAIN CARGO, SUCH AS MICRORNAS, THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO RECIPIENT CELLS AND MODIFY THEIR BIOLOGY. WE HAVE BUILT CAPACITY TO ISOLATE CIRCULATING EVS BASED ON THEIR SOURCE CELL TYPE (SCT) USING SURFACE MARKERS THAT EVS DERIVE FROM THE CELLS THAT RELEASED THEM. THESE NEW METHODS WILL ENABLE MY LAB TO IDENTIFY SIGNALS FROM THE PRECISE CELL TYPES AND ORGANS AFFECTED BY THE EXPOSURES. WE WILL APPLY THESE NEW METHODS TO LARGE COHORT STUDIES WITH EXISTING BLOOD SAMPLES AND CLINICAL DATA COLLECTED LONGITUDINALLY AT MULTIPLE TIME POINTS OVER DECADES OF FOLLOW-UP TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC COMMUNICATION ROUTES MEDIATING THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION ON THE BRAIN. BASED ON PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE AND PILOT DATA, MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT CIRCULATING EVS RELEASED BY THE LUNG IN RESPONSE TO AIR POLLUTION CARRY SIGNALS, INCLUDING MICRORNAS, THAT CAN THAT REACH THE BRAIN AND ACCELERATE BRAIN AGING. IN PARALLEL, WE WILL CONDUCT IN VITRO STUDIES INVESTIGATING HOW EVS RELEASED BY THE LUNG IN RESPONSE TO AIR POLLUTION AFFECT BRAIN FUNCTION USING HUMAN BRONCHIAL EPITHELIAL CELL CULTURES AND CULTURED 3D BRAIN ORGANOIDS\u2014A NOVEL MODEL THAT CAN BE USED TO STUDY THE NEURODEGENERATIVE PROCESSES UNDERLYING AGE- RELATED BRAIN HEALTH DETERIORATION. FURTHER, I WILL APPLY CURRENT DATA SCIENCE TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS ACTIVATED BY ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE HEALTH OUTCOMES. I AM CONFIDENT THAT I CAN SUCCESSFULLY LEAD THIS PROGRAM. OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, I SERVED AS (M)PI ON 16 NIH- FUNDED AWARDS. MY WORK HAS PRODUCED >450 PUBLICATIONS, AND I WAS RECENTLY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST CITED, MOST INFLUENTIAL INVESTIGATORS OF THE PAST DECADE. I HAVE DEMONSTRATED A BROAD VISION AND MADE SEMINAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MOLECULAR MECHANISMS, INCLUDING EVS, THAT ARE PART OF HOMEOSTATIC ALTERATIONS CAUSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES.

THE SAMPSON AND DUPLIN COMMUNITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED A TIME-SENSITIVE NEED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THEIR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH STATUS BEFORE THE ALIGNRNG SWE PROJECT BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONAL. OUR STUDY GOAL IS TO ADDRESS THE COMMUNITIES\u2019 NEEDS FOR BASELINE DATA WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH LANDSCAPE OF THE SAMPSON AND DUPLIN COUNTIES COMMUNITIES PRIOR TO WIDESPREAD SWE TRANSITIONS. WE WILL CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE LONGITUDINAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH MONITORING (I.E., AIR, WATER, AND HEALTH) WITH A COMMUNITY PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH APPROACH, LEVERAGING EXISTING RESOURCES, AND THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH A TRUSTED COMMUNITY ACTION GROUP FROM OTHER RTI-LEADING/COLLABORATING STUDIES IN THE SAME COMMUNITY.

THE HIGH MUTATION LOAD IN SKIN CANCERS MAKES IT CHALLENGING TO IDENTIFY DRIVER MUTATIONS IN THESE TUMORS, PARTICULARLY IN NON-CODING DNA.

LABORATORY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDIES REPORT VARIOUS ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING IMPACTS WITH MOST FOCUSED ALONG THE HYPOTHALAMUS-PITUITARY-GONADAL (HPG) AXIS ACTING THROUGH THE SUPPRESSION OF GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE (GNRH) LEADING TO DECREASED LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH) RELEASE.

DIFFERENT MODELS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT EITHER REPAIR, TRANSLESION SYNTHESIS, OR RECOMBINATION MAY OPERATE TO ALLOW REPLICATION TO RESUME. YET, THESE PATHWAYS DO NOT ALL SHARE EQUALLY BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES. WHEREAS DNA REPAIR IS ERROR FREE, TRANSLESION SYNTHESIS AND RECOMBINATION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED RATES OF MUTATIONS AND GENOME REARRANGEMENTS RESPECTIVELY. THUS CRITICAL TO ADVANCING THE FIELD, IS A CLEAR DETERMINATION OF THE MECHANISM BY WHICH DNA REPLICATION RESUMES FOLLOWING DISRUPTION.  THIS WORK WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT REPLICATION FORKS DISRUPTED BY UV-INDUCED DNA DAMAGE ARE PRIMARILY PROCESSED THROUGH A GENERAL RECOVERY MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR ENZYMES TO ACCESS TO THE BLOCKING LESION AND EFFECT REPAIR. MOST IN VITRO STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE REPLISOME IS DISRUPTED BY DNA LESIONS IN THE LEADING STRAND TEMPLATE, BUT NOT LAGGING STRAND TEMPLATE. FURTHER LEADING STRAND LESION ON PLASMID SUBSTRATES ARE PREFERENTIALLY PROCESSED THROUGH NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR.

THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY PURSUING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) IDENTIFY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE INTERVENTION, EXPOSURES (PM2.5, CARBON MONOXIDE), LEVELS OF BIOMARKERS OF INFLAMMATION, AND HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATIONS AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN AND INFANTS ENROLLED IN THE HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION INTERVENTION NETWORK (HAPIN) TRIAL; AND 2) IN A SUBSET OF INFANTS, IDENTIFY NOVEL BIOMARKERS OF ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN AIR POLLUTANTS AND HEMOGLOBIN, USING UNTARGETED METABOLOMICS AND MEDIATION ANALYSIS OF METABOLIC PERTURBATIONS. BOTH AIMS WILL USE EXISTING DRIED BLOOD SPOTS (DBS) COLLECTED FROM PARTICIPANTS IN THE HAPIN TRIAL SITE IN RURAL GUATEMALA. UNDER THE FIRST AIM, LABORATORY ANALYSES OF DBS FROM PREGNANT WOMEN (24-28 WEEKS GESTATION) AND INFANTS (AGE 6 MONTHS) WILL BE PERFORMED FOR A PANEL OF BIOMARKERS OF INFLAMMATION. THE RESULTING DATA WILL BE COMBINED WITH EXISTING DATA ON PARTICIPANTS\u2019 EXPOSURES AND HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATIONS IN SEPARATE MEDIATION MODELS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND INFANTS, TO EXAMINE POTENTIAL PATHWAYS OF EFFECT. FOR THE SECOND AIM, DBS FROM 100 INFANTS (AGE 6 MONTHS) WILL BE ANALYZED USING AN UNTARGETED HIGH-RESOLUTION METABOLOMICS WORKFLOW, AND RESULTING DATA WILL BE ANALYZED FOR ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN METABOLIC SIGNALS, EXPOSURES TO SPECIFIC POLLUTANTS, AND HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATIONS. THE SECOND AIM WILL ALSO INVOLVE AN EXPLORATORY MEDIATION ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE PATTERNS BETWEEN EXPOSURES, METABOLOMIC PERTURBATIONS, AND HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATION, USING A \u201cMEET IN THE MIDDLE\u201d FRAMEWORK APPROACH. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE OF ITS USE OF RIGOROUS, CUTTING-EDGE METHODS THAT LEVERAGE THE EXISTING DATA, SAMPLES, AND YEARS OF WORK ALREADY COMPLETED IN THE HAPIN TRIAL, TO GENERATE NEW EVIDENCE AND DISCOVERIES RELATED TO BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS LINKING HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION AND ANEMIA. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A PERSUASIVE NEW ARGUMENT FOR POLICYMAKERS TO PROMOTE AND SUBSIDIZE CLEAN COOKING, TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION AS WELL AS ANEMIA PREVALENCE AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CRITICAL PERIODS OF PREGNANCY AND THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4d4ce585-e95e-2593-758c-86dc120820ad-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21ES034139_7529"}, {"internal_id": 148296013, "Award ID": "R21ES034130", "Award Amount": 443360.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-25", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "EXTREME HEAT EVENTS AND FERTILITY: A NATIONAL STUDY - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF HEATWAVES AND OTHER EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS IS INCREASING RAPIDLY OWING TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND IS ONLY PROJECTED TO ESCALATE IN THE COMING DECADES.

DEMOGRAPHIC STUDIES SUGGEST THAT HOT WEATHER CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN BIRTH RATES 8 TO 10 MONTHS LATER, YET THE DRIVERS OF THIS ASSOCIATION ARE UNCLEAR. THE ANIMAL LITERATURE HAS ALSO LONG DOCUMENTED A LINK BETWEEN MATERNAL HYPERTHERMIA INDUCED BY HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND REDUCED FERTILITY, LARGELY MEDIATED THROUGH EFFECTS ON OOCYTE DEVELOPMENTAL CAPACITY; HOWEVER, WHETHER HEAT STRESS HAS A SIMILAR IMPACT ON FOLLICULAR DEVELOPMENT IN WOMEN IS LESS CLEAR.

THYROID DISRUPTORS, PERCHLORATE, THIOCYANATE, AND NITRATE ARE CHOSEN FOR THIS PROJECT BECAUSE THEY ARE KNOWN TO INHIBIT IODIDE UPTAKE AT THE SODIUM/IODIDE SYMPORTER (NIS). IODIDE UPTAKE AT THE NIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THYROID HORMONE SYNTHESIS BECAUSE IODINE DEFICIENCY DURING PREGNANCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK OF MATERNAL AND FETAL HYPOTHYROIDISM AND EVEN MILD IODINE DEFICIENCY IS KNOWN TO CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE.

CR(VI) ALSO CAUSES BRAIN DAMAGE THAT MAY BE LINKED TO A VARIETY OF NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF CR(VI) IN THIS AGING PARADIGM, USING YOUNG VS MIDDLE-AGED VS GERIATRIC RATS EXPOSED TO CR(VI) FOR 90 DAYS VIA DRINKING WATER. WE HYPOTHESIZE AGED ANIMALS WILL BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CR(VI)-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY AND THAT CR(VI)-INDUCES BRAIN AGING BY CAUSING ANEUPLOIDY AND CHROMOSOME INSTABILITY RESULTING IN GLIAL SENESCENCE. WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS WITH TWO AIMS. AIM 1 WILL IDENTIFY BRAIN REGIONS AND CELL POPULATIONS VULNERABLE TO CR(VI) TOXICITY ACROSS AGES. THIS AIM WILL ALLOW US TO COMPARE CR(VI) NEUROTOXICITY ACROSS AGES AND ENDPOINTS FOR PREMATURE OR ADVANCED AGING. AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE THE ROLE OF ANEUPLOIDY AND CHROMOSOME INSTABILITY IN CR(VI) NEUROTOXICITY AND BRAIN AGING. OUR STUDY WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL DETAILED INSIGHTS INTO CR(VI) NEUROTOXICITY, CONSIDERING AGE-, SEX-, REGION-, AND CELL TYPE-SPECIFIC EFFECTS. OUR STUDY WILL FURTHER CONSIDER MECHANISTICALLY HOW GENOTOXICITY CONTRIBUTES TO BRAIN AGING WITH IN VIVO AND IN VITRO TECHNIQUES. OUTCOMES WILL PROVIDE KEY AND NOVEL INSIGHTS FOR UNDERSTANDING CR(VI)\u2019S ROLE IN THE AGING PROCESS, IDENTIFYING CELLULAR AND REGIONAL TARGETS IN THE BRAIN, AND HOW AN AGED BRAIN IS AFFECTED BY TOXICANTS DIFFERENTLY. THIS STUDY WILL ALSO CHARACTERIZE A NEW MODEL SYSTEM FOR FURTHER STUDY OF NEUROTOXICITY AND AGING FOR CR(VI) OR OTHER METALS, AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN CR(VI) RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF THESE DATA.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3c9476c3-c39d-74de-31b6-2c9a10197e11-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21ES033327_7529"}, {"internal_id": 138795985, "Award ID": "R21ES033323", "Award Amount": 429688.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-30", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "CARDIOVASCULAR BENEFITS OF INHALED BIOGENIC VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS - PROGRAM DIRECTOR/PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR (LAST, FIRST, MIDDLE): CONKLIN, DANIEL J., PH.D.

ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT URBAN GREENSPACES EXERT THEIR BENEFICIAL EFFECTS BY REMOVING AIR POLLUTANTS AND PROMOTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, PLANTS EMIT BIOGENIC VOLATILE ORGANIC CHEMICALS (BVOCS), WHICH BY ELICITING BENEFICIAL CARDIOVASCULAR AND NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS COULD MEDIATE THE SALUTARY EFFECTS OF VEGETATION. VEGETATION IS A MAJOR UNDERAPPRECIATED DOMAIN OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS RECEIVED LIMITED INTEREST. EXPOSURE TO GREENSPACE WITHIN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN LINKED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. WE PROPOSE THAT PLANT-DERIVED BVOCS INCLUDING PINENES, LIMONENE, AND CITRONELLOL STIMULATE DISTINCT SIGNALING PATHWAYS, IN PART, BY ACTIVATING THE TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL ANKYRIN-1 (TRPA1) CHANNEL ON CARDIOVASCULAR TARGETS. IN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS, FOR EXAMPLE, ACTIVATION OF TRPA1 RELEASES NITRIC OXIDE THAT LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE, IMPROVES CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION AND TAMPS DOWN INFLAMMATION AND THROMBOSIS LEADING TO AN OVERALL DECREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK. COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL RIGOROUSLY ESTABLISH BENEFICIAL CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF INHALED BVOCS THAT ARE PREVALENT IN HUMAN ENVIRONMENTS. MOREOVER, OUR STUDIES WILL PROVIDE A FIRST TEST OF HYPOTHESIS THAT BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF INHALED BVOCS ARE MEDIATED, IN PART, BY TRPA1. THESE PRECLINICAL STUDIES MAY ALSO LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE TO GREENNESS, WHICH LIKELY WILL BE USEFUL IN CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC USE OF GREENNESS (E.G., PLANTING TREES) TO DECREASE CVD RISK IN HUMAN POPULATIONS.

THE SEVERITY OF VIRAL DISEASE VARIES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON IMMUNOREGULATION. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND ANIMAL MODEL STUDIES SUGGEST THAT EARLY LIFE EXPOSURE TO ARSENIC ALTERS THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO PATHOGENS, RESULTING IN PROLONGED OR EXCESSIVE INFLAMMATION. FURTHERMORE, AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT ARSENIC IS AN ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOR THAT INTERFERES WITH THE GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR (GR) SIGNALING PATHWAY, A CRITICAL REGULATOR OF INFLAMMATION, POSSIBLY WITH INTERGENERATIONAL EPIGENETIC EFFECTS. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT GAPS REMAIN IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ARSENIC DISRUPTS GR SIGNALING AND PROMOTES INFLAMMATION. THIS EXPLORATORY/ DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECT WILL USE ZEBRAFISH AS A MODEL SYSTEM TO TEST THE NOVEL HYPOTHESIS THAT ARSENIC EXACERBATES VIRAL DISEASE BY DOWNREGULATING THE KLF9-DEPENDENT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY GR SIGNALING PATHWAY. PRELIMINARY STUDIES INDICATE THAT KLF9 IS A GR-RESPONSIVE NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF PROINFLAMMATORY GENES, AND THAT BASAL AND CORTISOL- INDUCED KLF9 ACTIVITY IS SUPPRESSED IN ZEBRAFISH EMBRYOS EXPOSED TO VERY LOW LEVELS OF ARSENIC. ZEBRAFISH LARVAE HAVE A FUNCTIONAL INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND ARE A POWERFUL MODEL TO STUDY HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS DURING SYSTEMIC OR LOCALIZED INFLUENZA (IAV) INFECTION, AS TRAFFICKING OF MACROPHAGES AND NEUTROPHILS TO THE SITE OF IAV INFECTION CAN BE VISUALIZED USING LIVE IMAGING WITH TRANSGENIC LINES WITH FLUORESCENTLY LABELED LEUKOCYTES AS WELL AS FLUORESCENTLY LABELED VIRUSES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL USE THOSE TOOLS, AS WELL AS GR AMD KLF9 KNOCKOUT LINES THAT WE RECENTLY CREATED USING CRISPR, TO ACCOMPLISH TWO SPECIFIC AIMS. THE FIRST IS TO DETERMINE IF ARSENIC DYSREGULATES THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE TO IAV INFECTION BY SUPPRESSING THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY GR-KLF9 SIGNALING PATHWAY, LEADING TO EXCESSIVE AN/OR PROLONGED PRO-INFLAMMATORY GENE EXPRESSION AND FAILURE TO RESOLVE THE RESPONSE. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ASKING HOW TREATMENT OF ZEBRAFISH LARVAE WITH ARSENIC AFFECTS EXPRESSION OF KLF9 AND DOWNSTREAM PROINFLAMMATORY GENES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS PUTATIVE TARGETS OF KLF9-MEDIATED REPRESSION, AND ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF ARSENIC AND KLF9 DOSAGE ON THE RESPONSE DYNAMICS OF INFLAMMATORY CELLS (NEUTROPHILS AND MACROPHAGES) AND NF-KB ACTIVITY FOLLOWING IAV INFECTION. THE SECOND SPECIFIC AIM IS TO DETERMINE IF ARSENIC EXPOSURE HAS INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS ON THE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO IAV INFECTION THAT CORRELATE WITH ABERRANT ACTIVITY OF THE GR-KLF9 IMMUNOREGULATORY PATHWAY.

WHILE TRANSCRIPTIONAL RESPONSES TO HEPATOTOXICITY HAVE BEEN MAPPED, MECHANISMS OF POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL RESPONSES REMAIN UNDERSTUDIED. WE HAVE RECENTLY FOUND THAT PRODUCTION OF THE HEPATOKINE SELENOPROTEIN, SELENOP, IS POST-TRANSCRIPTIONALLY REGULATED DURING STRESS. SELENOP, WHICH HAS 10 SELENOCYSTEINE (SEC) RESIDUES FUNCTIONS TO DELIVER SELENIUM TO THE PERIPHERY, A PROCESS THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR MALE FERTILITY AND NORMAL BRAIN FUNCTION. PRIOR WORK HAS ESTABLISHED THAT SELENOP EXISTS AS TWO MAJOR ISOFORMS WITH EITHER LOW OR HIGH SELENIUM CONTENT (SHORT AND LONG FORMS, RESPECTIVELY) RESULTING FROM PREMATURE TERMINATION AT THE SECOND SEC CODON. THESE TWO FORMS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DISTINCT FUNCTIONS, THE SHORT FORM POSSESSING A HEPARIN BINDING AND THIOREDOXIN-LIKE ACTIVITY, WITH THE LONG FORM ADDING THE SELENIUM TRANSPORT FUNCTION. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE HOW SELENOP ISOFORM PRODUCTION IS ALTERED BY CELLULAR STRESS GENERATED BY ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS. HERE WE PRESENT PRELIMINARY DATA THAT A SPECIFIC SEQUENCE IN THE SELENOP 3' UTR IS REQUIRED FOR EFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF THE LONG FORM UNDER STRESS CONDITIONS IN LIVER CELLS. THIS SEQUENCE IS DISTINCT FROM THE WELL CHARACTERIZED SEC INSERTION SEQUENCE (SECIS), OF WHICH SELENOP HAS TWO, THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE INCORPORATION OF SEC AT SPECIFIC UGA CODONS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR PRIOR WORK SHOWED THAT SUPPLEMENTAL SELENIUM INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF LONG FORM SELENOP BY 4-FOLD IN VITRO THROUGH AN UNKNOWN MECHANISM. WE NOW KNOW THAT THE DOWNSTREAM SELENOP SECIS ELEMENT (SECIS-2) IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THIS SELENIUM RESPONSE. TOGETHER THESE DATA INDICATE THAT HEPATOCYTES USE AN RNA BASED SENSOR IN THE SELENOP MRNA THAT RESPONDS TO MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL CUES. BASED ON THIS PRELIMINARY DATA AND PRIOR WORK DEMONSTRATING THAT THE SELENOP CODING REGION SEQUENCE IS REQUIRED FOR EFFICIENT SEC INCORPORATION, WE PREDICT THAT THESE SENSORS ARE NOT DISCRETE SEQUENCES BUT RATHER COMPLEX SETS OF ELEMENTS FORMING RNA STRUCTURES THAT REGULATE RIBOSOME PROGRESSION OR SEC INCORPORATION EFFICIENCY OR BOTH. AS SUCH, THEY MAY REPRESENT BONA FIDE MAMMALIAN RIBOSWITCHES OF WHICH ONLY ONE OTHER HAS BEEN REPORTED. THE PREDICTED FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS REGULATORY MECHANISM IS THAT THE LONG FORM OF SELENOP CONTINUES TO BE MADE EVEN DURING OXIDATIVE STRESS AND SUBOPTIMAL SELENIUM CONCENTRATIONS, THUS PRESERVING SELENIUM DISTRIBUTION TO EXTRAHEPATIC TISSUES.

IMPORTANTLY, A UNIQUE MUTATIONAL SIGNATURE FOR AA HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN UPPER UROTHELIAL TRACT CANCER, BLADDER CANCER, RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA AND INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IN CHINA AND OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES, WHERE HERBAL REMEDIES ARE MOST WIDELY USED, 100 MILLION PEOPLE ARE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING AA-RELATED CANCERS AND/OR CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE.

THE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF PATHWAYS FOR BIOTRANSFORMATION OF AA, AMPLIFIED BY THE CURRENT CONFLICT IN THIS AREA OF RESEARCH REGARDING THE ROLE OF SULFOTRANSFERASES AND NITROREDUCTASES IN INDUCING AA TOXICITIES, PREVENTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH STRATEGIES.  THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS ON TWO IMPORTANT FINDINGS WE OBTAINED IN EARLIER STUDIES. USING AN INTEGRATED HUMAN \u201cLIVER- KIDNEY-ON-A-CHIP\u201d SYSTEM, WE REPORTED THAT ACTIVATION OF AA OCCURS IN THE LIVER AS WELL AS IN THE KIDNEY. WE ALSO FOUND THAT NOVEL REDUCTASES MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR AA METABOLISM AND TOXICITY.

TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE EMPLOY A TARGETED CRISPR/CAS9 GENOME EDITING APPROACH IN HUMAN HEPATIC HEPG2 AND RENAL HK-2 CELL LINES TO GENERATE DOUBLE-ALLELIC, FRAME-SHIFTING MUTATIONS IN GENES PUTATIVELY INVOLVED IN METABOLISM OF AA. ENGINEERED CELL LINES WILL BE EVALUATED IN TERMS OF THEIR SENSITIVITY TO AA AND COMPARED WITH RESPECTIVE PARENTAL CELLS. MASS SPECTROMETRIC AND DNA POSTLABELLING TECHNIQUES WILL BE APPLIED TO QUANTIFY THE MAJOR METABOLITES OF AA AND THEIR DNA ADDUCTS, RESPECTIVELY. PLASMIDS EXPRESSING CORRESPONDING WILD-TYPE AND CATALYTICALLY INACTIVE PROTEINS WILL BE USED TO TRANSFORM KNOCK-OUT CELL LINES IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE INVOLVEMENT OF PARTICULAR ENZYMATIC FUNCTION IN AA TOXICITIES.

THIS INFORMATION WILL INFORM CLINICAL SCIENTISTS ON DESIGN OF THERAPEUTICS GEARED TO REDUCE GENOTOXIC AND CYTOTOXIC EXPOSURE, AND WILL AID IN DEFINING INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF DEVELOPING AA-RELATED DISEASES.

SATELLITE AND GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST A STRONG DEPENDENCE OF AIR POLLUTION ON INTERANNUAL VARIABILITIES OF SUMMER MEAN TEMPERATURE IN SEUS3. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE INDIRECT HEALTH EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE VIA THE CLIMATE PENALTY ON AIR QUALITY CAN BE POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE SEUS REGION, IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT WE OBSERVED.

PARTICULAR OP COMPOUNDS LIKE PARATHION AND SARIN CAN RAPIDLY (WITHIN MINUTES) IRREVERSIBLY INHIBIT ACHE, RESULTING IN AN \u201cAGED\u201d ENZYME THAT IS REFRACTORY TO EXISTING ACHE REACTIVATORS, NAMELY 2-PRALIDOXIME (2-PAM), WHICH IS PART OF THE CURRENT OP TREATMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. CURRENT STRATEGIES TO REACTIVATE AGED ACHE HAVE SHORTCOMINGS SUCH AS INSUFFICIENT BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER PERMEABILITY AND LIMITED EFFICACY IN VIVO.

PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO RESCUE AGED ACHE HAVE FOCUSED ON PRODUCING NEW CLASSES OF REACTIVATORS THAT WILL ALKYLATE THE PHOSPHORYLATED ENZYME ALLOWING THEM TO REACT WITH OXIMES LIKE 2-PAM TO RECOVER ENZYME FUNCTION. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT EMPLOYS STRATEGIES AIMED AT INCREASING THE TURNOVER AGED ACHE AND RECOVERY OF NASCENT INTRACELLULAR ACHE. FOR EXAMPLE, INHIBITING OR LOSS OF MUSCLE-SPECIFIC PROTEIN KINASE (MUSK) DESTABILIZES THE ACHE COMPLEX LEADING TO THE DEGRADATION OF THE ENZYME. THEREFORE, THE CURRENT RESEARCH OBJECTIVE IS TO ASSESS WHETHER TARGETING PROTEINS IN THE SYNAPTIC ACHE COMPLEX CAN INCREASE ACHE TURNOVER AND RESTORE OPTIMAL ACHE ACTIVITY. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IN PURSUIT OF THIS OBJECTIVE IS THAT INHIBITING OR DEGRADING PROTEINS ASSOCIATED WITH AGED ACHE WILL CAUSE THE RELEASE OF THE AGED ENZYME, MAKING WAY FOR NEW ACHE TO REPOPULATE THE SYNAPSE, RESTORE OPTIMAL NEUROTRANSMISSION, AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF OP EXPOSURES. THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS THAT ELIMINATING AGED ACHE WILL ALLEVIATE THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF OP TOXICITY AND RESTORE PROPER NEUROTRANSMISSION.

IN THE FIRST AIM, PZ-1, A KNOWN INHIBITOR OF MUSK SHOWN IN PRELIMINARY STUDIES TO INDUCE TURNOVER OF AGED ACHE, WILL BE USED TO TREAT LONG-EVANS RATS EXPOSED TO DIISOPROPYL FLUORIDE (DFP), AN OP KNOWN TO AGE ACHE QUICKLY. MEASURES OF DFP NEUROTOXICITY, ACHE LEVELS, AND CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY RECOVERY WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE PZ-1 EFFICACY.

IN A SUBSET OF 95 CHAMACOS PARTICIPANTS WE FOUND THAT RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY TO OP USE DURING PREGNANCY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERED BRAIN ACTIVATION PATTERNS OBSERVED WITH FUNCTIONAL NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (FNIRS) DURING TASKS OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION. THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS WARRANT CORROBORATION AMONG A LARGER SAMPLE WITH HIGH QUALITY EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT DURING CRITICAL WINDOWS OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE ASSOCIATIONS OF EARLY LIFE EXPOSURE TO OP PESTICIDES ON NEURAL ACTIVATION PATTERNS AND FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY AMONG THE ENTIRE CHAMACOS COHORT OF YOUNG ADULTS (18-19 YEARS OLD).WE HAVE COLLECTED NEUROIMAGING DATA USING FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (FNIRS) \u2013 AN ALTERNATIVE TO FMRI WITH DISTINCT COST AND CONVENIENCE ADVANTAGES FOR FIELD-BASED RESEARCH \u2013 IN 458 PARTICIPANTS OF THE CHAMACOS COHORT.

FOR ~300 CHAMACOS PARTICIPANTS, WE HAVE ALREADY ANALYZED DIALKYL PHOSPHATES (DAPS), NON-SPECIFIC OP BIOMARKERS, IN MATERNAL PRENATAL AND EARLY CHILDHOOD (6 MONTHS \u2013 5 YEARS) URINARY SAMPLES. FOR ALL 458 PARTICIPANTS, WE HAVE ESTIMATED EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL OP PESTICIDES AND THEIR MIXTURES BASED ON RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY TO AGRICULTURAL OP PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS USING CALIFORNIA\u2019S UNIQUE PESTICIDE USE REPORTING (PUR) DATABASE. URINARY DAPS AND PUR DATA PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY EXPOSURE MEASURES, ALLOWING FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF OP PESTICIDES FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES DURING CRITICAL PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT. FOR THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT THE INTENSIVE PROCESSING OF THESE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL DATA AND INVESTIGATE ASSOCIATIONS OF EARLY LIFE OP PESTICIDES EXPOSURE WITH CORTICAL NEURAL ACTIVATION AND FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY USING FNIRS.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO INVESTIGATE URANIUM EXPOSURE IN RELATION TO HUMAN INFERTILITY IN THE FERNALD COMMUNITY COHORT (FCC). THE PROJECT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE ~9000-PERSON FCC, WHOSE MEMBERS LIVED IN A COMMUNITY THAT EXPERIENCED URANIUM EXPOSURE FROM 1951-1989 AND WERE PARTICIPANTS IN A MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM. YEARLY QUESTIONNAIRE DATA COLLECTION AND PERIODIC BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION WERE CONDUCTED SINCE 1991, AFTER THE CLOSURE OF THE URANIUM PROCESSING FACILITY. THE UNPRECEDENTED RESEARCH RESOURCE IN THE FCC WILL PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE URANIUM EXPOSURE AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO INFERTILITY.

THESE FINDINGS ARE SUPPORTED BY CLINICAL STUDIES SHOWING THAT AMBIENT O3 EXPOSURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH EOSINOPHILIC AIRWAY INFLAMMATION IN NON-ATOPIC CHILDREN. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT O3 EXPOSURE CAUSES MUCOUS CELL METAPLASIA/HYPERPLASIA IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES, RATS AND MICE.

WHILE PREGNANCY EXPOSURE TO AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION IS RELATED TO INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES, NO STUDIES IN HUMAN POPULATIONS HAVE YET ESTIMATED THE IMPACT ON THE SUBSEQUENT GENERATION\u2019S BIRTH OUTCOMES. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE MULTIGENERATIONAL IMPACT OF DIFFERENTIAL PREGNANCY EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION ON FUTURE GENERATION BIRTH OUTCOMES. BLACK WOMEN AND WOMEN WITH LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS IN THE U.S. HAVE PERSISTENT HIGHER PREVALENCE OF ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES, AND INDIVIDUALS BORN PRETERM OR TERM-LOW BIRTH WEIGHT HAVE COMPROMISED HEALTH ACROSS THE LIFE-COURSE. PREGNANCY EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION IN A PRIOR GENERATION, ALONG WITH INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY EXPERIENCED BY DISADVANTAGED AND DIVERSE COMMUNITIES, MAY THEREFORE CONTRIBUTE TO OBSERVED BIRTH OUTCOME AND LIFETIME HEALTH DISPARITIES. USING THE LARGEST MULTIGENERATIONAL BIRTH COHORT IN THE U.S., THIS PROJECT AIMS TO: 1) QUANTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FIRST GENERATION PREGNANCY EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTANTS (PARTICULATE MATTER [PM2.5] AND NITROGEN DIOXIDE [NO2]) AND ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES OF THE THIRD GENERATION, AND 2) ESTIMATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF FIRST GENERATION PREGNANCY EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION ON RACIAL/ETHNIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN BIRTH OUTCOMES OF THE THIRD GENERATION. THE MULTIGENERATIONAL BIRTH COHORT CONSISTS OF NEARLY 700,000 CALIFORNIA BIRTHS WITH GEOCODED RESIDENCE INFORMATION FOR TWO GENERATIONS BORN 1982-2011. PREGNANCIES FROM EACH GENERATION WILL BE ASSIGNED RECENTLY-DEVELOPED HISTORIC PM2.5 AND NO2 CONCENTRATIONS, AND BIRTH DATA ENHANCED THROUGH LINKAGE TO PRENATAL AND NEWBORN SCREENING RECORDS AND CENSUS AND METEOROLOGICAL DATA. LONGITUDINAL MARGINAL MODELS WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THE DIRECT RELATION OF FIRST GENERATION PREGNANCY AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE WITH PRETERM AND TERM- LOW BIRTH WEIGHT IN THE THIRD GENERATION. EQUITABLE EXPOSURE CONDITIONS WILL BE SIMULATED USING A STOCHASTIC INTERVENTION TO EVALUATE CHANGE IN RACIAL/ETHNIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC BIRTH OUTCOME DISPARITIES UNDER THE SCENARIO WHERE DISADVANTAGED GROUPS RECEIVE AN EXPOSURE DISTRIBUTION EQUAL TO THAT OF HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS OR NON-HISPANIC WHITE CALIFORNIANS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE FINDINGS MAY UNCOVER ANOTHER PATHWAY BY WHICH AIR POLLUTION INFLUENCES HEALTH, AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY UNMEASURED EXPOSURE BURDEN FROM PREGNANCY AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE IN A PRIOR GENERATION. THE PROPOSED STUDY ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGNING PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INTERVENTIONS. BY CHARACTERIZING PRIOR GENERATION EXPOSURES IN THE CONTEXT OF RACIAL/ETHNIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITIES, THE PROJECT PROVIDES METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF EXPOSURES AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.

LONGER CARBON CHAIN COMPOUNDS [C8; E.G., PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID (PFOA) AND PERFLUOROOCTANESULFONIC ACID (PFOS)], WERE PHASED OUT BASED ON HEALTH RISKS. SHORTER CARBON CHAIN (<C8) PFAS WERE PRODUCED TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL PERSISTENCE AND BIOACCUMULATION. PFAS ARE AN EMERGING CLASS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS AND THE REPLACEMENT PFAS ARE NOT REGULATED BY FEDERAL AGENCIES. THE DEVELOPING CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO TOXICANT EXPOSURE AND A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROTOXICITY (DNT) MAY RESULT FROM PFAS EXPOSURES INCLUDING INCREASED RISK FOR ATTENTION DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER AND REDUCED MOTOR AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING. SIMILAR TO OTHER PFAS TOXICITY STUDIES, THE LIMITED DNT LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE MAINLY FOCUSED ON PFOS OR PFOA. SOME OF THESE DNT STUDIES SUGGEST IMPACTS TO THE DOPAMINERGIC (DA) SYSTEM. IT IS NOW ESTIMATED THERE ARE >4000 PFAS WITH MOST HAVING LIMITED TO NO TOXICITY INFORMATION AVAILABLE. FUTHERMORE, SOME STUDIES INCLUDING OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE SIMILAR TOXICITY OUTCOMES WITH SOME EVEN BEING MORE POTENT THAN THE C8 COMPOUNDS. MOREOVER, MOST PFAS ARE PRESENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT IN A MIXTURE, WHICH CAN RESULT IN VARIOUS MIXTURE INTERACTIONS. AS SUCH, A SIGNIFICANT GAP REMAINS IN OUR BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF DNT OF PFAS AND PFAS MIXTURES, MECHANISMS AND FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS TO THE DEVELOPING CNS, AND THE RISK OF PERSISTENT NEUROTOXICITY IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE PARADIGM (DOHAD). PFAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN ARE GENX (C6, REPLACEMENT FOR PFOA) AND PFBS (PERFLUOROBUTANESULFONIC ACID, C4, REPLACEMENT FOR PFOS). THESE PFAS ALTERNATIVES ARE DETECTED IN ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES AND IN TREATED DRINKING WATER. QUESTIONS REMAIN ON DNT AND PERSISTENT NEUROTOXICITY OF A SHORT-TERM DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE (E.G., THE DOHAD PARADIGM). THIS QUESTION IS SIGNIFICANT CONSIDERING GENX IS REPORTED TO BE MORE POTENT THAN PFOA AND IS LIKELY THAT CO-EXPOSURE TO GENX AND PFOA WILL OCCUR. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT EXPOSURE TO GENX AT EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES WILL RESULT IN DNT TARGETING THE DA SYSTEM AND PERSISTENT NEUROTOXICITY IN ADULTS WITH THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF GENX AND PFOA RESULTING IN AN ADDITIVE TOXICITY RESPONSE. WE WILL FIRST DEFINE DNT OF GENX USING THE ZEBRAFISH BY ASSESSING GROSS AND FINE MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES, BEHAVIOR, AND TARGETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DA SYSTEM. RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED TO PFOA, PFBS, AND GENX/PFOA MIXTURES AND ALTERATIONS IN THE SEROTONERGIC SYSTEM (AIM 1). SECOND, WE WILL ASSESS PERSISTENT NEUROTOXICITY OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL PFAS EXPOSURE IN THE DOHAD PARADIGM (AIM 2).

DUE TO THE HIGH PATIENT BURDEN FOR ASTHMA IN CHICKASAW NATION, THE TRIBE HAS IDENTIFIED A NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND RISK FACTORS FOR ASTHMA-RELATED MORBIDITY. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF AEROALLERGENS AND ANTHROPOGENIC AIR POLLUTION ON ASTHMA MORBIDITY IN CHICKASAW NATION AND TO INVESTIGATE MORE EFFICIENT WAYS TO MONITOR, CONTROL, AND ULTIMATELY PREVENT ASTHMA MORBIDITY AMONG THIS HIGHLY-SUSCEPTIBLE POPULATION. THE CHICKASAW NATION PROVIDES CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE MAJORITY OF AMERICAN INDIANS RESIDING WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONAL AREA IN SOUTHCENTRAL OKLAHOMA; THUS, IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE TRIBE PROMOTES THE HEALTH OF THE OVERALL COMMUNITY.

SPECIFICALLY, STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO MICROPLASTICS AND PLASTICIZERS (I.E., PHTHALATES) FROM CONTAMINATED SEAFOOD. FOR DECADES, BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS (TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS) HAVE BEEN USED AS SENTINELS OF MARINE POLLUTION RISKS FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON SEAFOOD. DUE TO THE RECENT DETECTION OF PREVALENT PHTHALATE EXPOSURE IN COASTAL BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS, A SENTINEL-SPECIES APPROACH WILL BE USED TO ADDRESS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) ASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR TROPHIC EXPOSURE TO MICROPLASTICS; 2) DETERMINE IF PHTHALATE EXPOSURE IS AN INDICATOR OF MICROPLASTIC EXPOSURE; AND 3) EVALUATE SPATIOTEMPORAL DIFFERENCES IN PHTHALATE EXPOSURE. THIS UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN INNOVATIVE STUDIES OF A FEDERALLY-PROTECTED SPECIES, PARTICIPATE IN ECOTOXICOLOGICAL ANALYSES IN STATE-OF-THE-ART LABORATORIES, DEVELOP MARKETABLE STATISTICAL SKILLS, AND ENHANCE THEIR SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION THROUGH CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUBLICATIONS AND PRESENTATIONS. STUDENTS WILL ALSO BE EXPOSED TO A BROAD RANGE OF BIOMEDICAL FIELDS AS THEY WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH SCIENTISTS WITH EXPERTISE IN EPIDEMIOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS, BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION, ECOTOXICOLOGY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH.  THE OCEANS CONTAIN TRILLIONS OF PLASTIC PARTICLES, MOSTLY MICROPLASTICS (I.E., PARTICLES < 5 MM DIAMETER; APPROXIMATELY 93% OF PARTICLES), WHICH HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN ORGANISMS AT ALL LEVELS OF THE MARINE FOOD WEB. THESE DISCOVERIES SUGGEST THAT SEAFOOD SAFETY IS BEING THREATENED AND PUBLIC HEALTH COMPROMISED, AS MICROPLASTIC INGESTION CAN LEAD TO GASTROINTESTINAL INFLAMMATION, ALTERED METABOLISM, AND OXIDATIVE STRESS. PLASTICS CAN ALSO LEACH ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING PHTHALATES, WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INFERTILITY, ABNORMAL REPRODUCTIVE ORGAN DEVELOPMENT, INCREASED BREAST CANCER RISK, AND POOR PREGNANCY OUTCOMES.

THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO COMPREHENSIVELY EXAMINE THE SENSITIVITY OF MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS TO CLIMATE DISASTERS IN YOUTH, AS WELL AS THE COMPOUNDING AND CASCADING EFFECT OF CONCURRENT EXTREME EVENTS ACROSS THE U.S. WE WILL LEVERAGE OUR LONGSTANDING PARTNERSHIP WITH CRISIS TEXT LINE (CTL), A GLOBAL NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES FREE, 24/7, AND CONFIDENTIAL TEXT-BASED CRISIS RESPONSE SERVICE. CTL CURRENTLY HAS THE LARGEST REPOSITORY OF MENTAL HEALTH DATA IN THE WORLD AND, UNLIKE OTHER DATA SOURCES, CAN PROVIDE DATA IN REAL-TIME. WE WILL PERFORM A CAUSAL ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING AIMS: AIM 1: EXAMINE THE LOCAL SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS OF HELP-SEEKING FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN RESPONSE TO THREE EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS\u2014HURRICANES, WILDFIRES, AND HEATWAVES\u2014AND HOW CRISIS RESPONSE VARIES BY EVENT-TYPE AND IN THE ACUTE AND CHRONIC PHASES. AIM 2: IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY-LEVEL SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH RESILIENCE IN YOUTH IMPACTED BY A CLIMATE DISASTER. AIM 3: COMPARE THE COMPOUNDING EFFECT OF CONCURRENT EXTREME EVENTS ON LONGITUDINAL CHANGES IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH. RESULTS WILL INFORM CRISIS RESPONSE AND MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EFFORTS AND FULFILL A VITAL RESEARCH GAP THROUGH THE \u201cEMBRACE OF COMPLEXITY\u201d BY DEVELOPING CONCEPTUAL MODELS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING HOW CLIMATE IMPACTS MENTAL HEALTH. THIS STUDY\u2019S FINDINGS WILL BE ENHANCED THROUGH THE QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH DESIGN, WHICH WILL LEVERAGE RICH SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA TO IDENTIFY THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS RELATED TO CLIMATE DISASTERS AND MEDIATING UNDERLYING DISPARITIES DRIVING THESE PATTERNS. THIS PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE OUR RICH AND PRODUCTIVE COLLABORATION TO ENGAGE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, PRIMARILY REPRESENTED BY RURAL \u2018FIRST GENERATION\u2019 COLLEGE STUDENTS IN RESEARCH.

THE WIDESPREAD EXPOSURE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION TO PHTHALATES HAS RAISED SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC CONCERN. PHTHALATES ARE ADDED TO PLASTICS WIDELY FOUND IN FOOD PACKAGING, TOYS, MEDICAL DEVICES, PHARMACEUTICALS, FURNITURE, AND COSMETICS AND THEY LEACH OUT OF THESE PRODUCTS INTO THE FOOD, WATER, AND AIR. DI-2-ETHYLHEXYL PHTHALATE (DEHP) IS ABUNDANTLY USED, AND INSIDE THE GUT, IT IS HYDROLYZED TO THE ACTIVE METABOLITE MONO-(2-ETHYLHEXYL) PHTHALATE (MEHP). RECENT EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT PHTHALATES ARE MITOCHONDRIAL DNA (MTDNA) TOXICANTS THAT ALTER MTDNA COPY NUMBER. TOXIC CONTAMINANTS THAT DISRUPT MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION MAY CAUSE MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE OR PLACE INDIVIDUALS WITH GENETIC VARIANTS AFFECTING MITOCHONDRIA AT GREATER RISK. THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERN, AS ADULT MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE AFFECTS 1 IN 4,300 INDIVIDUALS. FURTHERMORE, NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS (NRTIS) USED TO TREAT HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION CAUSE MITOCHONDRIAL TOXICITY AND MIMIC MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE BY CAUSING SEVERE MTDNA DEPLETION. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ADDRESS GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE MTDNA TOXICANTS INDUCE MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS DRIVING THE TOXICANT-INDUCED VARIABILITY IN MTDNA DEGRADATION THAT WE HAVE OBSERVED IN OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF UNDIFFERENTIATED AND DIFFERENTIATED CELLS TREATED WITH THE NRTI 2',3'- DIDEOXYCYTIDINE (DDC). THE FUNCTION OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CELLS IN AN ORGAN IS TO REPLACE CELLS LOST UNDER STEADY- STATE CONDITIONS AND DURING TISSUE REPAIR. WE PREDICT THAT MITOCHONDRIAL POLLUTANTS CAN TRIGGER OR CONTRIBUTE TO DISEASE BY TARGETING UNDIFFERENTIATED CELLS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT UPON EXPOSURE TO A MTDNA TOXICANT, A MITOPHAGY-MEDIATED MTDNA DEGRADATION PATHWAY IS SPECIFICALLY UP-REGULATED IN UNDIFFERENTIATED CELLS CAUSING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MTDNA DEPLETION COMPARED TO THAT IN DIFFERENTIATED CELLS.

WE FOUND PREVIOUSLY THAT PM LEVELS IN PHILADELPHIA SUBWAY STATIONS CAN BE UP TO FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN LEVELS ON AN URBAN STREET. WE WILL ASSESS EFFECTS OF PARTICULATE MATTER (PM) FROM THE VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON LUNG EPITHELIAL CELLS (16HBE AND PRIMARY CELLS), ASSESSING CYTOTOXICITY, OXIDATIVE STRESS, AND THE CELLULAR RESPONSE PATHWAYS INVOLVING THE ANTIOXIDANT RESPONSE ELEMENT (ARE) AND THE XENOBIOTIC RESPONSE ELEMENT (XRE). A PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO ASSESS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF VARIOUS PM COMPONENTS TO THESE CELLULAR RESPONSES. IN AIM 1, WE WILL COLLECT 102 TOTAL SAMPLES FROM THE VARIOUS LOCATIONS AND DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT LEVELS OF BLACK CARBON (BC), ULTRAFINE PARTICLES (UFP), AND METALS CORRELATE WITH THE CELLULAR EFFECTS. BOTH BC AND UFP HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CELLULAR OXIDATIVE STRESS. SUBWAY PM IS PARTICULARLY HIGH IN METALS SUCH AS IRON, COPPER, ANTIMONY AND ZINC, WHICH COME FROM THE RAILS, WHEELS, BRAKE PADS, AND OTHER PARTS OF THE TRAINS, WHICH HAVE BEEN CORRELATED WITH OXIDATIVE STRESS AND ARE ACTIVATION FROM OTHER PM SOURCES. IN AIM 2, WE WILL EXAMINE THE ROLE OF SOLUBLE/CHELATABLE METALS COMPARED TO METALS IN WHOLE PARTICLES ON THE CELLULAR EFFECTS, AS WELL ASSESS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ON THESE EFFECTS. AS PART OF THIS WORK, WE WILL PROBE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE XRE AND ARE PATHWAYS TO THE CELLULAR EFFECTS BY USING SIRNA AGAINST THE RELEVANT SENSORS/TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS, ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND NRF2, RESPECTIVELY. DOSE RESPONSE CURVES WILL BE USED TO ASSESS EFFECTS OVER A RANGE OF CONCENTRATIONS. RESULTS WILL HELP IN UNDERSTANDING AND IDEALLY MITIGATING THE HEALTH RISKS OF SUBWAY AIR PARTICLES.

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ARSENIC IS A CONTAMINANT FOUND IN DRINKING WATER AND FOOD, RESULTING IN THE EXPOSURE OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO CONCENTRATIONS ABOVE THE CURRENT US EPA AND WHO DRINKING WATER STANDARD. EVIDENCE FROM EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IN UTERO, CHILDHOOD, AND ADULT EXPOSURE TO ARSENIC IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED BIRTH WEIGHT AND WEIGHT GAIN, ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. IN ADDITION, EVEN THOUGH INGESTION IS THE MAIN ROUTE OF ARSENIC ABSORPTION, ALMOST NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF ARSENIC ON THE SMALL INTESTINE ITSELF. OUR LAB HAS CONDUCTED PILOT STUDIES EXPOSING INTESTINAL ORGANOIDS TO ARSENIC, AND FOUND THAT EXPOSURE REDUCES STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND INHIBITS PRODUCTION OF SPECIFIC ADULT CELL TYPES. THUS, THE GOAL OF THIS APPLICATION IN TO ASSESS THE TIME COURSE, THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PHENOTYPE, THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THIS LOSS OF DIFFERENTIATION, AND WHETHER A SIMILAR LOSS OF DIFFERENTIATION HAPPENS TO THE INTESTINAL EPITHELIUM IN VIVO. IN THE FIRST AIM, WE DETERMINE THE DOSE-RESPONSE, ASSESS WHETHER ARSENIC AND ITS MONO- AND DI-METHYLATED METABOLITES ARE EQUIVALENTLY TOXIC, AND ASSESS THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABERRANT DIFFERENTIATION, INCLUDING CHANGES IN APOPTOSIS, PROLIFERATION, AND CELL SIGNALING. IN THE SECOND AND THIRD AIM, WE WILL ASCERTAIN WHETHER INTESTINAL NICHE FUNCTION, STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION, AND FUNCTION IS IMPAIRED DURING AN IN VIVO ARSENIC EXPOSURE. WE WILL ALSO STUDY THE ROLE OF MESENCHYMAL CELLS IN MAINTAINING THE NICHE. THESE STUDIES WILL FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ARSENIC ALTERS CELLULAR DIFFERENTIATION AND REDUCES GROWTH.

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ASTHMA AFFECTS ~300 MILLION PEOPLE WORLD-WIDE AND CAUSES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEATHS ANNUALLY. EVEN WITH THE ADVENT OF EFFECTIVE BIOLOGIC AGENTS, MANY PATIENTS REMAIN SYMPTOMATIC AND SUFFER FREQUENT EXACERBATIONS. THIS IS, IN PART, BECAUSE OF THE HETEROGENEITY OF ASTHMA PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; AND BECAUSE OF THE SUBOPTIMAL PREDICTIVE VALUE OF THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE BIOMARKERS. LARGELY BECAUSE OF THIS, SEVERAL CONSORTIA HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AROUND THE WORLD TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA. IN AN EFFORT TO COORDINATE THE PROGRAMS OF THESE NETWORKS, LEAD INVESTIGATORS FROM US AND UK CONSORTIA HAVE BEEN MEETING TWICE ANNUALLY, LARGELY WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE NHLBI AND THE ASTHMA UK AND BRITISH LUNG FOUNDATION PARTNERSHIP. THESE MEETINGS HAVE OCCURRED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY (ATS) AND EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY SOCIETY (ERS) CONFERENCES. AT THE 2019 ERS CONFERENCE, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT EFFORTS TO COORDINATE THESE PROGRAMS WERE FALLING SHORT. IN PARTICULAR, COLLABORATIVE USE OF DATABASES FOR TESTING AND VALIDATION WAS NOT BEING FACILITATED; INNOVATION WAS NOT BEING ENCOURAGED AND PURSUED \u2013 PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF NON-TH2 ASTHMA; AND STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE WORLD WERE NOT BEING ENCOURAGED WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. THE US-UK MEETINGS LAST ONLY A HALF-DAY, DO NOT INVOLVE ALL STAKEHOLDERS, ARE NOT FOCUSED ON PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES OF COLLABORATION, AND DO NOT USUALLY RESULT IN ACTIONABLE INNOVATIONS. THEREFORE, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW NETWORK, THE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE ASTHMA NETWORK (ICAN), WAS PROPOSED TO BE INAUGURATED WITH A FACE-TO-FACE MEETING. THIS MEETING IS INTENDED TO HARMONIZE AND USE EXISTING NETWORKS, RATHER THAN TO DUPLICATE THEM. SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE FIRST MEETING, PROPOSED HERE, WILL BE AS FOLLOWS: 1) TO ESTABLISH AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE ASTHMA RESEARCH NETWORK ENTITY; 2) TO ESTABLISH INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS TO TEST AND/OR VALIDATE INNOVATIVE HYPOTHESES; 3) TO ESTABLISH INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS TO DEVELOP AND TRANSLATE IDEAS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPIES; 4) TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS TO DO INNOVATIVE STUDIES OF PERSONALIZED SEVERE ASTHMA TREATMENTS. 5) TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS. THIS INITIAL MEETING OF THE ICAN IS ENVISIONED TO LIVE ON AFTER 2021 IN THE FORM OF SUBSEQUENT REGULAR MEETINGS AND DIGITAL PLATFORMS FOR INNOVATION AND FOR DATA SHARING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "adf5ba97-e9a1-374f-72a1-40502b70df1a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R13HL156425_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49779668, "Award ID": "R13HG007809", "Award Amount": 41222.94, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2015-04-30", "CFDA Number": "93.866", "Description": "SYMPOSIUM ON ADVANCES IN GENOMICS, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND STATISTICS (SAGES)", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b655b3eb-6e27-dfdd-c16c-ad7f8949f987-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R13HG007809_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49779643, "Award ID": "R13HG002394", "Award Amount": 578565.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2008-09-11", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "THE INTERNATIONAL MAMMALIAN GENOME CONFERENCE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "810d4dbe-2b0b-06bc-19cf-0b4758d32d32-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R13HG002394_7529"}, {"internal_id": 147111478, "Award ID": "R13HD108938", "Award Amount": 40000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-03-04", "CFDA Number": "93.865", "Description": "FETAL, INFANT, TODDLER NEUROIMAGING GROUP (FIT'NG): UNITING CLINICAL, COMPUTATIONAL, ENGINEERING, AND NEUROSCIENCE TO ADVANCE DISCOVERIES FOR THE YOUNG CHILD. - NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS, INCLUDING PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AND LEARNING DISABILITIES, AND SUBSTANCE USE, REMAIN PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS AS THEY CAN LEAD TO SUBOPTIMAL EDUCATIONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL OUTCOMES IN ADOLESCENCE AND ADULTHOOD. HUMAN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IS A COMPLEX PROCESS THAT BEGINS IN THE WEEKS FOLLOWING CONCEPTION AND UNDERGOES RAPID DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF POSTNATAL LIFE. ADVANCING UNDERSTANDING OF EARLY NEURODEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES, AND THE CONDITIONS WHICH FOSTER HEALTHY VERSUS MALADAPTIVE DEVELOPMENT, REPRESENTS A CRITICAL MEANS OF ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES. THE RAPIDLY GROWING FIELD OF FETAL, INFANT, AND TODDLER NEUROIMAGING DEMONSTRATES POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS AREA, WITH AN INCREASE FROM 160 TO 530 PUBLICATIONS PER YEAR DURING THE 1990'S TO 2021. YET, A MYRIAD OF CHALLENGES HINDER PROGRESS OF THE FIELD INCLUDING METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES RELATED TO DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING; RAPID CHANGES IN AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES FOR DISSEMINATION TO USERS; AND UNDERREPRESENTATION OF MINORITIZED INDIVIDUALS AMONG RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCHERS. WE CONSIDERED THE GROWING PAINS OF THE COMMUNITY AND RESPONDED TO THE NEED FOR A BRIDGE ORGANIZATION THAT BRINGS TOGETHER THOSE WITH EXPERTISE IN DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE, CLINICAL-SCIENCE, AND COMPUTATIONAL AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING TO FACILITATE ADVANCES IN DATA QUALITY AND IMAGE PROCESSING TOOLS FOR THE YOUNG BRAIN. THE FETAL, INFANT, AND TODDLER NEUROIMAGING GROUP (FIT'NG), NON-PROFIT ACADEMIC SOCIETY ESTABLISHED IN 2018, AIMS TO BRING TOGETHER INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCHERS WITH A FOCUS ON NEURODEVELOPMENT DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE. AN ANNUAL MEETING FOCUSED SOLELY ON THIS FIELD IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEP UP WITH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, ESTABLISH AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES TO ADDRESS METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES, AND INCREASE DIVERSITY AT EVERY LEVEL.

AS A CORNERSTONE CONFERENCE IN THIS RAPIDLY EXPANDING FIELD, THE BIENNIAL CELL BIOLOGY OF METALS GRC HAS HAD A LOYAL FOLLOWING SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 2005, CONSISTENTLY ATTRACTING BETWEEN 140 AND 180 ATTENDEES. DUE TO THE HIGH DEMAND TO ATTEND THIS CONFERENCE, THE ACCOMPANYING GRS WAS INITIATED IN 2017 TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SPEAKING AND NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN THIS FIELD. GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES ARE INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED FOR THE HIGH-QUALITY, CUTTING EDGE NATURE OF THESE MEETINGS THAT SHOWCASE NEW UNPUBLISHED WORK; THE PROGRAM OF THE PROPOSED 2021 CELL BIOLOGY OF METALS CONFERENCE ENDEAVORS TO MAINTAIN THIS HIGH STANDARD. THE 9TH ITERATION OF THIS CONFERENCE SERIES WILL SPAN A DIVERSE RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS FROM GENETICS, BIOCHEMISTRY, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY, AND INORGANIC CHEMISTRY, TO BIOINFORMATICS, MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS, AND CLINICAL MEDICINE. SESSION TOPICS WILL FOCUS ON THE ACQUISITION, TRAFFICKING, REGULATION, AND DYNAMIC UTILIZATION OF METALS IN PROTEINS, CELLS, TISSUES, AND ORGANISMS FROM MICROBES TO HUMANS, AND THE ROLE OF METALS IN PHYSIOLOGY, DISEASE, AND HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS. IN ADDITION, NOVEL TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS FOR MONITORING, QUANTIFYING, AND VISUALIZING METALS IN CELLS AND TISSUES WILL BE SHARED AND DISCUSSED. THE CONFERENCE FORMAT, INCLUDING KEYNOTE PRESENTATIONS, RESEARCH TALKS FROM JUNIOR AND SENIOR INVESTIGATORS, POSTER TALKS, POSTER SESSIONS, AND INFORMAL SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSIONS, PROMOTES OPEN COMMUNICATION, EFFECTIVE MENTORING, AND CROSS-DISCIPLINE COLLABORATIONS FOR NEW AND ESTABLISHED INVESTIGATORS AND TRAINEES THAT WILL SUSTAIN THE HEALTHY GROWTH AND DIVERSIFICATION OF THIS CRITICAL AND RAPIDLY EXPANDING FIELD. SINCE METAL ACQUISITION AND HOMEOSTASIS STRONGLY IMPACTS HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE AS WELL AS MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS CONFERENCE SERIES IS TO UNCOVER THE PATHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF DYSFUNCTIONAL METAL METABOLISM IN ORDER TO TRANSLATE THESE FINDINGS INTO CUTTING-EDGE DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES AND THERAPEUTIC TREATMENTS FOR METAL-RELATED DISEASES AND DISORDERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "RI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "234b0bf7-6dda-7f84-f2b9-918a2cc6cba3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R13DK130226_7529"}, {"internal_id": 156367621, "Award ID": "R13CA281373", "Award Amount": 15000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-02-02", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "2023 MAMMALIAN DNA REPAIR GRC & GRS - PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY THIS 5-DAY GRC AND 2-DAY GRS CONFERENCE IS FOCUSED ON THE RESEARCH OF GENOMIC INSTABILITY AND ITS IMPLICATIONS IN HUMAN DISEASES AND THERAPIES. EXPOSURES ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENDOGENOUS SOURCE OF DNA DAMAGE PRODUCE THOUSANDS TO OVER A MILLION LESIONS AND CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE GENOME PER CELL EVERY DAY. COMMON ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCES OF DNA DAMAGE INCLUDE SUNLIGHT, RADIATION, ALDEHYDES, AND COMBUSTION BYPRODUCTS, WHILE ENDOGENOUS SOURCES INCLUDE OXYGEN METABOLISM, METABOLITES, ALKYLATION AND DYSREGULATION OF DNA REPLICATION, TRANSCRIPTION AND MITOSIS. IN NORMAL CELLS, A MULTITUDE OF DNA REPAIR AND DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE MECHANISMS SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE TO MAINTAIN GENOMIC STABILITY. HOWEVER, DEFECTS IN THESE MECHANISMS CAN RESULT IN DISEASES RANGING FROM RARE DEVELOPMENTAL AND PREMATURE AGING SYNDROMES TO COMMON CANCERS. THIS MAMMALIAN DNA REPAIR GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCE (GRC) AND ASSOCIATED GORDON RESEARCH SEMINAR (GRS) WILL BRING TOGETHER DIVERSE RESEARCHERS STUDYING THE MECHANISMS THAT PROTECT THE GENOME AGAINST DNA DAMAGE, AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR HUMAN HEALTH WHEN THESE PATHWAYS FAIL. ADDITIONALLY, THIS CONFERENCE WILL PROMOTE DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO INHIBIT DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE AND REPAIR MECHANISMS, OR LEVERAGE DYSFUNCTION IN THESE MECHANISMS, TO SELECTIVELY TARGET TUMORS IN A MORE EFFICACIOUS AND LESS TOXIC MANNER. THE OBJECTIVES ARE: 1) TO EXPOSE RESEARCHERS AT ALL LEVELS (FACULTY, RESEARCHERS FROM INDUSTRY, POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS, AND GRADUATE STUDENTS) TO NEW FRONTIERS AND INNOVATIVE METHODS IN THIS RAPIDLY PROGRESSING RESEARCH FIELD. 2) TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG SCIENTISTS TO NETWORK AND PRACTICE PRESENTING THEIR RESEARCH. 3) TO GENERATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF INCLUSION AND RIGOR THAT ENCOURAGES THE EXCHANGE OF SCIENTIFIC IDEAS THAT MAY FOSTER COLLABORATIONS OR SPUR NEW INNOVATION. 4) TO PROVIDE FORMAL AND INFORMAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. WE WILL ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES BY ASSEMBLING DIVERSE SPEAKERS AND POSTER PRESENTERS. 44% OF THE INVITED SPEAKERS IN THE GRC ARE WOMEN AND WE EXPECT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE GRS SPEAKERS BE FEMALE TRAINEES.

UNDERSTANDING THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS IS THE KEY TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW DRUG TARGETS AND BIOMARKERS FOR CANCER THERAPY AND DIAGNOSIS. RECENT STUDIES HAVE POINTED TO A NEW ROLE OF M6A IN REGULATING RNA-GUIDED DNA REPAIR SUGGESTING THAT IT CAN MEDIATE CANCER DEVELOPMENT BY INTERPLAYING WITH DNA DAMAGE AND REPAIR. WE RECENTLY FOUND THAT AN M6A LOCATED NEXT TO THE STOP CODON ON THE TRANSCRIPT OF DNA POLYMERASE SS (POL SS) WAS ELIMINATED BY OXIDATIVE RNA BASE DAMAGE INDUCED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANT, POTASSIUM BROMATE (KBRO3), SHIFTING ITS DEPOSITION TO THE UPSTREAM OF THE POL SS TRANSCRIPT.

HOWEVER, AN INCREASING BODY OF EVIDENCE IN VERTEBRATES INDICATES DEVELOPMENTAL AND ADULT EXPOSURE TO NEONICOTINOIDS NEGATIVELY AFFECTS A BROAD RANGE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES INCLUDING IMMUNE, REPRODUCTIVE, AND METABOLIC SYSTEMS.

WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE TLS-DEFICIENT H4 LRS MUTATIONS COMPROMISE REPLICATION-COUPLED NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY AND POST-ASSEMBLY NUCLEOSOME STABILITY UPSTREAM OF DNA LESIONS, THEREBY ATTENUATING THE RETENTION OF PCNA AND THE RECRUITMENT OF TLS POLYMERASES. WE WILL DETERMINE HOW THE TLS-DEFICIENT HISTONE H4 LRS MUTATIONS 1) AFFECT NUCLEOSOME OCCUPANCIES UPSTREAM OF UV LESIONS, 2) AFFECT THE RETENTION OF PCNA AND THE RECRUITMENT OF TLS POLYMERASES, AND 3) FUNCTIONALLY INTERACT WITH HISTONE H3-H4 CHAPERONES, WHICH ACT AT DIFFERENT STEPS OF THE REPLICATION-COUPLED NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROCESS, TO AFFECT TLS AND UV MUTAGENESIS. FINDINGS FROM THE PROJECT WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR FUTURE ELUCIDATION OF HOW NUCLEOSOME FEATURES CROSSTALK WITH HISTONE CHAPERONES AND LOCAL GENOMIC FEATURES TO MODULATE THE GENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF TLS AND MUTAGENESIS.

AN INCREASING NUMBER OF POPULATION-BASED STUDIES HAVE INDICATED MATERNAL AND FETAL EXPOSURE TO PFAS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRED FETAL GROWTH. ONE AREA OF PFAS RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED IS THE POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECT OF PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO PFAS ON OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT. BIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY HAS BEEN SUGGESTED IN EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES THAT PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO PFAS COULD AFFECT FETAL DEVELOPMENT VIA MECHANISMS SUCH AS THE DISRUPTION OF SPERMIOGENESIS, INCREASING DAMAGE TO SPERM DNA, AND MODIFYING SPERM EPIGENETIC PROFILES.

EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT BECAUSE EDCS AFFECT SIMILAR METABOLIC PATHWAYS, THE OVERALL EFFECT OF EDCS MAY BE GREATER THAN EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL CHEMICALS ON METABOLIC OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, RESEARCHERS LACK A SIMPLE SUMMARY INDEX TO QUANTIFY EXPOSURE BURDEN TO EDCS. BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF EDCS THAT EXIST, A SUMMARY EDC BURDEN METRIC COULD AID IN RISK ASSESSMENT, BIOMONITORING, AND BE USED IN DIABETES RISK PREDICTION MODELS. IN THIS R03, WE INTRODUCE A FLEXIBLE CLASS OF ITEM RESPONSE THEORY (IRT) MODELS TO QUANTIFY AN EDC BURDEN SCORE.

MANY OF THESE HEALTH EFFECTS ARE LINKED TO DYSREGULATION OF INNATE IMMUNE FUNCTION, BUT HOW PFASS IMPACT INNATE IMMUNOLOGY IS WIDELY UNKNOWN. PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT PFAS EXPOSURE SUPPRESSES INNATE IMMUNE FUNCTION IN VITRO AND IN VIVO. FURTHER, PFAS EXPOSURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THYROID DISEASE, AND NORMAL THYROID HORMONE LEVELS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR INNATE IMMUNE FUNCTION. THEREFORE, THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT PFAS-INDUCED IMMUNOTOXICITY IS MEDIATED BY DECREASED THYROID HORMONE SIGNALING.

PREGNANCY IS AN UNDERSTUDIED CRITICAL WINDOW, AND FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS ON PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR UNBORN. SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY (SMM) IS CURRENTLY A SURVEILLANCE INDICATOR USED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL TO MEASURE AND MONITOR IMPROVEMENTS IN MATERNAL HEALTH; HOWEVER, IT HAS YET TO BE USED IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SMM IS A COMPOSITE OF 21 LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS THAT ARISE DURING THE PROCESS OF LABOR AND DELIVERY. THESE CONDITIONS ARE KNOWN AS \u201cNEAR MISS\u201d COMPLICATIONS (I.E., AN EVENT IN WHICH A WOMAN NEARLY DIES) THAT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL CARE BURDEN, INCLUDING NEWLY DIAGNOSED CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS, PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS DISORDERS, AND AMPLIFIED RISKS OF MATERNAL DEATHS. BLACK WOMEN ARE 2 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM THESE LIFE- THREATENING PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES OF THIS IMPORTANT DISPARITY ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN AND UNDEREXPLORED.  AN IMPORTANT SCIENCE GAP REMAINS IN IDENTIFYING MEASURES THAT ELUCIDATE CLIMATE AND MATERNAL HEALTH INEQUITIES, PARTICULARLY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND PREGNANCY RISKS AMONG BLACK WOMEN IN THE SOUTH. THIS PROJECT WILL USE A RETROSPECTIVE BIRTH COHORT TO EXPLORE THE CAUSAL LINKAGES BETWEEN THE UPSTREAM SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS AND CLIMATE-RELATED CHANGES IN MATERNAL MORBIDITY. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO DEVELOP PATIENT AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE DURING PREGNANCY. THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVES OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY IS TO EXAMINE CLIMATE-SENSITIVITY IN SMM RISK AND ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIAL-ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF RACIAL INEQUALITIES IN MATERNAL MORBIDITY. WE WILL ADDRESS THIS RESEARCH GAP WITH THE FOLLOWING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1. EXAMINE PATTERNS IN SMM RATES IN RESPONSE TO THREE CLIMATE HAZARDS--EXTREME HEAT, HURRICANES, AND INLAND FLOODING FOR A SOUTHERN BIRTH COHORT; AIM 2. CHARACTERIZE THE INDIVIDUAL AND NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL SOCIAL (E.G., POVERTY, RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION) AND ENVIRONMENTAL (E.G., GREENSPACE) DETERMINANTS THAT DRIVE MATERNAL HEALTH DISPARITIES IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. AT THE COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT, OUR EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE TO 1) UNDERSTAND HOW THE RATE OF SMM DIFFERS ACROSS DIFFERENT CLIMATE HAZARDS AND 2) ELUCIDATE THE CAUSAL PATHWAYS LINKING CLIMATE CHANGE AND MATERNAL MORBIDITY. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE RESULTS WILL EXTEND BEYOND IDENTIFYING DISEASE RISKS TO CAPTURING PROTECTIVE FACTORS, AS WELL AS AID IN HYPOTHESIS GENERATION AROUND PATHWAYS THAT CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS CAUSAL INFERENCE. THIS CONTRIBUTION IS INNOVATIVE SINCE PROPOSED RESULTS WILL PROVIDE NEW KNOWLEDGE AND A NECESSARY FIRST STEP IN FURTHERING UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON MATERNAL HEALTH, PROVIDING

IN THE PRESENT PROPOSAL, WE EXAMINE SEVERAL EXPOSURES OF HIGH RELEVANCE TO BLACK WOMEN, WITH A FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL EXPOSURES. WE WILL USE DATA FROM THE BLACK WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH STUDY (BWHS), THE LARGEST STUDY IN EXISTENCE FOCUSING ON THE HEALTH OF BLACK WOMEN.

HUMAN STUDIES SHOW THAT EVEN AT LOW LEVELS OF EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY, POLY- AND PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFAS) ARE ASSOCIATED WITH RAPID INFANT WEIGHT GAIN AND GREATER RISK FOR CHILDHOOD OBESITY. POSTNATALLY, BREASTFEEDING IS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF INADVERTENT PFAS TRANSMISSION TO INFANTS, POTENTIALLY OFFSETTING SOME BENEFITS OF EXTENDED BREASTFEEDING. RECENT FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE DEVELOPING GUT MICROBIOME IS EXPOSED TO BREAST MILK PFAS, WHICH MAY ALTER GUT BACTERIA AND FECAL METABOLITES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OBESITY.

IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW NASCENT STRAND DEGRADATION IS EFFICIENTLY TRIGGERED WHEN NEEDED BUT WITH ENOUGH SPECIFICITY THAT SPURIOUS DEGRADATION IS AVOIDED. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND HOW NASCENT STRAND DEGRADATION IS TRIGGERED.

KNOWN HCC RISK FACTORS INCLUDE HEPATITIS B OR C INFECTION, ALCOHOL ABUSE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS LIKE AFLATOXIN B1. THESE RISK FACTORS ARE MOST COMMON IN EAST ASIA, SOUTH AMERICA, AND AFRICA, WHICH HAVE PROPORTIONALLY HIGHER HCC RATES. HOWEVER, HCC INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY IN WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE INCREASING; LIVER CANCER IS POISED TO BECOME THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER-RELATED DEATH IN THE U.S. BY 2030. NEW RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING NON-ALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS, ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN A FIFTH OF U.S. CASES, SUGGESTING THE EXISTENCE OF UNIDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS. WE HAVE FOUND THAT DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTALLY RELEVANT DOSES OF THE CHEMICAL POLLUTANT BISPHENOL A (BPA) IS ASSOCIATED WITH HCC IN BOTH MALE AND FEMALE C57BL/6J MICE. EXPOSED MICE SHOW DOSE-RESPONSIVE RATES OF HCC IN RESPONSE TO BPA ALONE, WITH NO KNOWN CO-EXPOSURES. THIS FINDING IMPLICATES BPA AS A COMPLETE CARCINOGEN IN THE LIVER, RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH STAGES OF CARCINOGENESIS: INITIATION AND PROMOTION. IN ADDITION, THE DOSE-RESPONSIVE INCREASE IN HCC WITH INCREASING BPA DOSE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF GENOTOXIC CANCER INITIATION. PRIOR DATA SHOW THAT BPA INCREASES CELLULAR REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS) AND THAT BPA INDUCES A MUTATION SPECTRUM CONSISTENT WITH ROS-INDUCED OXIDATIVE DNA DAMAGE. BPA ALSO DISRUPTS ENDOCRINE SIGNALING THROUGH ESTROGEN RECEPTOR  (ER). ER SIGNALING PROTECTS FEMALES AGAINST HCC, WHICH IS WHY MALES ARE MORE PRONE TO THIS FORM OF CANCER.

OUR PREVIOUS DATA UTILIZING A CURATED MIXTURE (MIX) OF EDCS, REPRESENTATIVE OF THESE INFANT EXPOSURES, FOUND THAT A LOW DOSE EDC MIXTURE ALTERED TESTOSTERONE (T) LEVELS IN MALE MICE AT BIRTH AND RESULTED IN MALE-SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL CHANGES, INCLUDING REDUCED ATTENTION, IMPULSIVITY, AND REDUCED SOCIABILITY, PHENOTYPES SEEN IN ADHD AND ASDS. OCCURRING IN BOTH RODENTS AND HUMANS, MALES EXPERIENCE A SURGE OF T SHORTLY BEFORE AND AFTER BIRTH THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO LOW-TO-MODERATE LEVELS OF INORGANIC ARSENIC (IAS) MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS DURING EARLY CHILDHOOD AS WELL AS LATER IN LIFE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LIMITED RESEARCH EXAMINING HOW ARSENIC EXPOSURE PROMOTES ALLERGIC AIRWAY DISEASES SUCH AS ASTHMA, ALTHOUGH THERE IS GROWING DOCUMENTATION THAT ARSENIC EXPOSURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS. OUR PREVIOUS WORK, DEMONSTRATED IN ANIMAL MODEL, SUGGESTS THAT MATERNAL EXPOSURES TO HOUSE ALLERGENS AFFECT THE IMMUNOLOGICAL SENSITIZATION AND LUNG GROWTH OF THE NEONATE THROUGH EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS OF THE FETAL GENE TRANSCRIPTION; WHICH DETERMINES THE OFFSPRING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ALLERGIC AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS (AHR). CERTAINLY, THESE FINDINGS POINT TO THE EPIGENETIC MECHANISM A POSSIBLE MEDIATOR OF THE MULTIGENERATIONAL EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS ON OFFSPRING\u2019S ASTHMA DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY.

WE RECENTLY FOUND THAT TRYPTOPHAN (TRP) 2,3-DIOXYGENASE (TDO2) GENE EXPRESSION IS STRIKINGLY UPREGULATED IN MUT- BUT NOT WILD-TYPE (WT)-MED12 LM. TDO2 CATALYZES A CRITICAL STEP IN TRP BREAKDOWN TO KYNURENINE (KYN), AN ENDOGENOUS LIGAND FOR THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) WHOSE ACTIVATION STIMULATES THE EXPRESSION OF PRO- GROWTH GENES TO PROMOTE CELL SURVIVAL AND PROLIFERATION IN VARIOUS TISSUES. KYN LEVELS ARE MARKEDLY HIGHER IN LM VS MYOMETRIUM, PARTICULARLY IN MUT-MED12 LM. TRP AND KYN TREATMENTS OF LM CELLS ACTIVATED AHR AND INCREASED CELL SURVIVAL; BLOCKING THE TRP-KYN-AHR PATHWAY BY SIRNA KNOCKDOWN OR INHIBITORS OF TDO2 OR AHR ABOLISHED THESE EFFECTS, WITH MUTANT LM CELLS SHOWING HIGHER SENSITIVITY TO THE TREATMENTS.

NAFLD IS A TYPICAL COMPLEX DISEASE INVOLVING GENE-ENVIRONMENT (GXE) INTERACTIONS. OVER THE PAST DECADE, WHILE GWAS FOR NAFLD HAVE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS GENETIC RISK ALLELES, A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT EXPOSURE TO HEAVY METALS (PB, CD, HG, AS, ETC.)

TISSUE-RESIDENT AM\u00d8 ARE ESSENTIAL TO LUNG HOMEOSTASIS AND DIRECT RESPONSES TO PATHOGENS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, INCLUDING O3. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT MURINE O3 EXPOSURE EXPANDS TISSUE-RESIDENT AM\u00d8, AND THEIR LOSS EXACERBATES O3-INDUCED LUNG INJURY. CONVERSELY, MONOCYTE-DERIVED AM\u00d8, RECRUITED DURING LUNG INJURY (E.G. VIRAL INFECTION), AUGMENT INFLAMMATION. OUR GROUP PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT MONOCYTE-DERIVED AM\u00d8 RECRUITED AFTER LUNG INJURY PERSIST IN THE LUNG VIA AUTOCRINE M-CSF/M-CSF RECEPTOR (M-CSF-R), MAINTAIN AN ACTIVATED PHENOTYPE, AND DRIVE CHRONIC LUNG DISEASES. EXTENDING THIS TO HUMANS, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ABUNDANCE AND ACTIVATION STATE OF MONOCYTE-DERIVED AM\u00d8S NEGATIVELY CORRELATE WITH PULMONARY FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH EARLY PULMONARY FIBROSIS. CUMULATIVELY, OUR PUBLISHED AND PRELIMINARY DATA SUPPORT THAT DISTINCT AM\u00d8 SUBSETS DIRECT THE BALANCE BETWEEN ONGOING INFLAMMATION AND ITS RESOLUTION AND SUGGEST THAT AM\u00d8 COMPOSITION, PARTICULARLY THE BASELINE PRESENCE AND ACTIVATION OF MONOCYTE-DERIVED AM\u00d8, PRIOR TO EXPOSURE CAN ENHANCE SEVERITY AND PERSISTENCE OF O3-INDUCED LUNG INJURY. THIS BASELINE CONDITION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTIONS, INCLUDING INFLUENZA AND SARS-COV2, INDUCE THE RECRUITMENT OF MONOCYTE-DERIVED AM\u00d8S. LEVERAGING MECHANISTIC MOUSE MODELS, STATE- OF-THE-ART LINEAGE-TRACING SYSTEMS, SINGLE-CELL GENOMICS, AND SERIAL SAMPLING IN CONTROLLED HUMAN O3 EXPOSURES, WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE ABUNDANCE AND ACTIVATION STATE OF MONOCYTE-DERIVED AM\u00d8S DRIVE O3- INDUCED LUNG INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES VIA AUTOCRINE M-CSF/M-CSF-R SIGNALING. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: AIM 1: TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF AUTOCRINE MONOCYTE-DERIVED ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGE M-CSF/M-CSF-R SIGNALING IN MAINTAINING LUNG INFLAMMATION IN MOUSE MODELS OF O3-EXPOSURE. AIM 2: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ABUNDANCE AND ACTIVATION STATUS OF MONOCYTE-DERIVED AM\u00d8 PREDICTS LUNG PHYSIOLOGICAL AND INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES IN CONTROLLED ACUTE O3 EXPOSURES IN NORMAL HUMAN SUBJECTS AND IN INDIVIDUALS WITH PRIOR SARS-COV2 INFECTION.

HERE, WE PUT FORTH A PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THIS DATA GAP USING HUMAN BRONCHIAL EPITHELIAL CELLS (HBECS) IN VITRO. HBECS ARE THE FIRST CELLS OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT TO INTERACT WITH O3, AND WE HAVE SHOWN THAT HBECS EXPOSED TO O3 IN VITRO UPREGULATE THE EXPRESSION OF KEY PRO-INFLAMMATORY GENES (E.G., CXCL8), MIRRORING THE IN VIVO RESPONSE.

AS CLIMATE CHANGE IS PROJECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE ALREADY HIGH WILDFIRE RISK IN THIS REGION, THERE IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH NEED TO ESTABLISH THE EFFECTS OF SMOKE EXPOSURE, WHICH HAS A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT CHEMICAL COMPOSITION FROM AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION, ON CVD RISKS. UNDERSTANDING THE KEY DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE CARDIOTOXIC EFFECTS OF SMOKE CONSTITUENTS IS IMPORTANT TO DESIGN EFFECTIVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE MEASURES TO FIRE SMOKE, AND TO ASSESS THE LONG-TERM HEALTH CARE NEEDS IN THE WESTERN US.

THIS IS A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM BECAUSE EARLY REPRODUCTIVE AGING IS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY ONSET OF INFERTILITY AND INCREASED RISK OF SEVERAL DISEASES AND EARLY DEATH.

FURTHER, PUBLISHED DATA INDICATE THAT ACTIVATION OF THE INFLAMMASOME AND INFLAMMATION ARE HALLMARKS OF REPRODUCTIVE AGING AND OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT DEHP EXPOSURE INCREASES INFLAMMATORY MACROPHAGES IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS, DEHP AND DINP EXPOSURE INCREASE EXPRESSION OF INFLAMMATORY PATHWAYS IN THE OVARY, AND DEHP ACTIVATES RESIDENT MACROPHAGES IN THE PERITONEAL CAVITY. IN ADDITION, PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REGULATING REPRODUCTIVE AGING AND OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT DEHP AND ITS METABOLITE (MEHP) INDUCE EXPRESSION OF THE KNOWN AHR TARGETS IN THE PITUITARY AND THE OVARY AND THAT A SPECIFIC AHR ANTAGONIST RESCUES OVARIAN FOLLICLES FROM PHTHALATE-INDUCED INHIBITION OF FOLLICLE GROWTH.

PRELIMINARY DATA FROM OUR LAB SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT DIRECT RNA METHYLATION VIA N6-METHYLADENOSINE (M6A/M), MAY BE AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM CONTRIBUTING TO THE FUNCTIONALLY ALTERED TRANSCRIPTOME AFTER DEVELOPMENTAL PB EXPOSURE.

WE HAVE SHOWN THAT TCDD INDUCES THE PROGRESSION OF STEATOSIS TO STEATOHEPATITIS (NON- ALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS (NASH)) WITH FIBROSIS, HOWEVER THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD BEYOND AHR ACTIVATION AND SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION.

PQ-INDUCED NEURODEGENERATION IS TIGHTLY COUPLED TO THE ACTIVATION OF MICROGLIA AND APPEARS TO REQUIRE PRIMING OF THE MICROGLIAL RESPONSE. THEREFORE, FACTORS THAT MODULATE THE MICROGLIAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE COULD LEAD TO NEUROPROTECTION AND SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES.

THE LARGE LOW-COST DATASETS HAVE INCREASED UPTAKE OF DATA-INTENSIVE MACHINE-LEARNING (ML) METHODS LIKE RAN- DOM FORESTS (RF) FOR EXPOSURE PREDICTION MODELING. HOWEVER, EXPOSURE DATA ARE SPATIO-TEMPORALLY CORRELATED AND RF ENCOUNTERS NUMEROUS ISSUES FOR DEPENDENT DATA LEADING TO LOSS OF ACCURACY. WE PROPOSED RF-GLS, A NOVEL EXTENSION OF RF THAT EXPLICITLY ACCOUNTS FOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL CORRELATION TO IMPROVE PREDICTIONS. WE WILL DEVELOP EXTENSIONS OF RF-GLS FOR USE IN THE SPATIAL-LTERING, FOR PREDICTING CATEGORICAL EXPOSURE DATA (LIKE AIR QUALITY INDEX CATEGORY), AND FOR ESTIMATING EXPOSURE EFFECTS AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR CONFOUNDERS. WE WILL USE RF-GLS FOR PREDICTING PERSONAL EXPOSURES USING THE LOW-COST AMBIENT AND WEARABLE NETWORK DATA IN BALTIMORE.  WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE RICH REPEATED MEASURES DATA ON EXPOSURES FROM LOW-COST MONITORS CAN BE DIRECTLY USED IN ASSOCIATION STUDIES BETWEEN HEALTH AND AIR-POLLUTION WITHOUT ANY AD-HOC AND LOSSY DATA REDUCTION LIKE USING THE MEAN EXPOSURE. WE PROPOSE A SCALAR-ON-DISTRIBUTION-ANALYSIS (SODA) THAT USES THE ENTIRE SAMPLE OF EXPOSURES AS A DISTRIBUTION-VALUED COVARIATE IN ASSOCIATION STUDIES. SODA IS TAILORED TO REPEATED MEASURES COVARIATES AND WILL BE MORE EFCIENT THAN THE GENERAL-PURPOSE SOFR (SCALAR-ON-FUNCTION-REGRESSION). SODA WILL BE USED TO DIRECTLY ASSESS WHICH ASPECTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S EXPOSURE DISTRIBUTION CORRELATE MOST WITH THEIR HEALTH, WHICH IN TURN CAN HELP RE-EVALUATE AND UPDATE CURRENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS.

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO DISSECT MOLECULAR PATHWAYS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION VERSUS INHIBITION OR RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION.

THIS SUGGESTS THAT PROMOTING THE RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION WILL BE MORE BENEFICIAL THAN SUPPRESSING PERSISTENT UNRESTRAINED INFLAMMATION. OUR STUDIES ARE FOCUSED ON MACROPHAGES WHICH PLAY A KEY ROLE IN BOTH INITIATING AND RESOLVING INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES TO TISSUE INJURY. THIS ACTIVITY IS MEDIATED BY DISTINCT SUBSETS BROADLY CLASSIFIED AS PROINFLAMMATORY M1 AND PRORESOLUTION M2 MACROPHAGES. EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION DEPENDS ON METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING OF MACROPHAGES FROM AN M1 PHENOTYPE TO AN M2 PHENOTYPE, WHICH INVOLVES A SWITCH FROM GLYCOLYSIS TO OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION AS A SOURCE OF ENERGY. WE DISCOVERED THAT THIS REPROGRAMMING IS SUPPRESSED FOLLOWING CHRONIC OZONE EXPOSURE. THE GOAL OF OUR STUDIES IS TO ANALYZE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING SUPPRESSION OF MACROPHAGE REPROGRAMMING. IN RECENT STUDIES WE IDENTIFIED FARNESOID-X RECEPTOR (FXR), A NUCLEAR RECEPTOR IMPORTANT IN BILE ACID METABOLISM, WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY, AS IMPORTANT IN PROMOTING M1 TO M2 MACROPHAGE REPROGRAMMING IN THE LUNG. FOLLOWING OZONE EXPOSURE, MACROPHAGE FXR ACTIVITY IS DOWNREGULATED. THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ACTIVITY OF PROINFLAMMATORY M1 MACROPHAGES AND REDUCED ACTIVITY OF PRORESOLVING M2 MACROPHAGES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT MICRORNAS THAT REGULATE THE PROINFLAMMATORY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NFB ARE DYSREGULATED IN MACROPHAGES AFTER OZONE EXPOSURE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THERE IS PROTRACTED ACTIVATION OF NFB SIGNALING RESULTING IN INCREASED PRODUCTION OF TNF, IL-1, AND CYTOTOXIC REACTIVE NITROGEN SPECIES.

WHILE COX2 IS COMMONLY THOUGHT TO BE PRO- INFLAMMATORY, COX2 MACROPHAGE-SPECIFIC KNOCK-OUT (COX2MKO) MICE DEVELOP INTESTINAL INFLAMMATION WHEN FED A HIGH FAT DIET. MACROPHAGE COX2 THUS APPEARS TO PROVIDE AN INHIBITORY MOLECULAR CHECK ON CHRONIC INFLAMMATION MEDIATED BY DIETARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES. IN PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS, WE SHOW THAT LOSS OF COX2 IMPAIRED EFFEROCYTOSIS IN MOUSE PRIMARY MACROPHAGES AND COX2 MODULATED THE PRODUCTION OF EFFEROCYTOSIS- DEPENDENT LIPID INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS THAT NOT ONLY AFFECT SECONDARY EFFEROCYTOSIS BUT ALSO INDUCE A TISSUE REPAIR PHENOTYPE IN INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL ORGANOIDS.

APOA-I MIMETIC PEPTIDES (4F) INHIBIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFLAMMATORY DISEASES THAT ARE EXACERBATED BY DIETARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES INCLUDING ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND INTESTINAL INFLAMMATION.

IN ADDITION, WE FIND FIBROADIPOGENIC REMODELING OF THE MUSCLE THAT RESEMBLES MYOSTEATOSIS, A MAJOR RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES IN HUMANS. MECHANISTICALLY, STEM CELL MITOCHONDRIA TARGETED BY ARSENIC PROMOTE EPIGENETIC INDUCTION OF PATHOGENIC PROGENITOR CELL PHENOTYPES AND DIFFERENTIATION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RESOLVE THE MECHANISMS FOR DYSFUNCTIONAL MITOCHONDRIAL AND NUCLEAR EPIGENETIC COMMUNICATION IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES THAT RESTORE NORMAL MUSCLE METABOLISM. TOWARDS THIS GOAL, THE STUDIES IN SPECIFIC AIM 1 WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT DYSFUNCTIONAL MITOCHONDRIAL COMMUNICATION DRIVES PATHOGENIC METABOLIC AND PHENOTYPIC CHANGES IN PROGENITOR CELLS AND THEIR NICHE THAT DICTATE MUSCLE MAINTENANCE AND ADIPOSITY. IMPORTANTLY, WE WILL USE A MITOCHONDRIAL PROTECTIVE PEPTIDE TO DETERMINE WHETHER REVERSING THE MITOCHONDRIAL EFFECTS OF ARSENIC RESTORES NORMAL EPIGENETIC REGULATION, STEM CELL PHENOTYPES, AND MUSCLE METABOLISM. THE GOAL OF THE STUDIES IN SPECIFIC AIM 2 IS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MALADAPTIVE MITOCHONDRIAL PHENOTYPES DRIVE PATHOGENIC PARACRINE AND SYSTEMIC COMMUNICATION. THESE STUDIES FOCUS ON DYSFUNCTIONAL PARACRINE AND SYSTEMIC SIGNALING MEDIATED BY MIRNA CARGO IN EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES RELEASED FROM ARSENIC- EXPOSED MUSCLE PROGENITOR CELLS AND SKELETAL MUSCLES. WE WILL IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF ARSENIC ON THE PROFILE OF MIRNA CARGO AND DETERMINE WHETHER THIS ALTERED PROFILE AFFECTS METABOLISM IN SYSTEMIC ORGANS, SUCH AS THE LIVER. AS IN AIM 1, WE WILL INTERVENE WITH MITOCHONDRIAL PROTECTIVE AGENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE MIRNA CARGO PROFILES AND ORGAN METABOLISM CAN BE RESTORED TO NORMAL. IF SUCCESSFUL, THESE STUDIES WILL IDENTIFY CLINICALLY-RELEVANT AND IMMEDIATELY-TRACTABLE STRATEGIES TO REVERSE PATHOGENIC MUSCLE MAINTENANCE AND LOSS OF REGENERATIVE CAPACITY FROM CHRONIC ARSENIC EXPOSURES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH PHTHALATE EXPOSURES CHANGE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AT A CRITICAL WINDOW OF VULNERABILITY (FROM BIRTH TO AGE 5), AND TO RECONCILE THE PARADOXICAL FINDINGS BY TRACKING A VARIETY OF SOCIAL, BEHAVIORAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES THROUGH LONGITUDINAL EVALUATION.

PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE (PFOS), A LEGACY PFAS, IS THE MOST PRODUCED AND WELL STUDIED PFAS. ELEVATED MATERNAL PFOS IS SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MATERNAL VASCULAR DYSFUNCTION AND FGR IN HUMANS. WHETHER THIS INCREASE IN PFOS IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION AND MANIFESTATIONS OF FGR IS UNKNOWN.

STRIKINGLY, LITTLE IS KNOWN WHETHER CHRONIC CD EXPOSURE WOULD AFFECT THE DISPOSITION OF DRUGS THAT ARE USED TO TREAT DISEASES. RENAL TRANSPORTER PROTEINS INVOLVE IN DRUG DISPOSITION BY MEDIATING DRUG TRANSPORT ACROSS TUBULAR CELLS AND PARTICULARLY PROXIMAL TUBULES.

EXPOSURE TO LOW DOSES OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENZENE IN URBAN AREAS HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN INCREASING THE RISK FOR METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION ACROSS ALL AGES. HOWEVER, A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO LOW-DOSE BENZENE AND METABOLIC HOMEOSTASIS IS NOT YET ESTABLISHED. USING THE LIMITED AVAILABLE LITERATURE ON ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE TO BENZENE AND ITS METABOLIC OUTCOMES, WE PERFORMED A PRELIMINARY META-ANALYSIS AND FOUND A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO BENZENE AND METABOLIC IMPAIRMENTS. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO BENZENE AT VARYING LOW DOSES, MODELING HUMAN EXPOSURE ROUTES, INDUCES SIGNIFICANT INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HYPERGLYCEMIA IN RODENTS. NEUROINFLAMMATION IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE CAUSAL FACTORS IN THE PATHOLOGY OF METABOLIC DISEASES.

THE DNA DAMAGE AND ASSOCIATED MUTAGENESIS INDUCED BY DNA ADDUCTS AND DNA-PROTEIN CROSSLINKS HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF FORMALDEHYDE CARCINOGENICITY RESEARCH. HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES SHOWED THAT EXOGENOUS FORMALDEHYDE CAUSED ONLY A MODEST INCREASE IN DNA ADDUCTS ABOVE LEVELS CAUSED BY ENDOGENOUS FORMALDEHYDE. THIS SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO FORMALDEHYDE-INDUCED CARCINOGENICITY. WE AND OTHERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT FORMALDEHYDE REACTS WITH LYSINE RESIDUES ON HISTONE PROTEINS TO FORM A LABILE SCHIFF BASE OR THE MORE STABLE N6-FORMYLLYSINE, AND THAT BOTH SCHIFF BASES AND N6-FORMYLLYSINE RESIDUES ARE REFRACTORY TO ACETYLATION. THESE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT FORMALDEHYDE-HISTONE LYSINE ADDUCTS MIGHT INTERFERE WITH IMPORTANT CELLULAR PROCESS REGULATED BY HISTONE LYSINE ACETYLATION. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNKNOWN WHICH PROCESS IS AFFECTED BY THIS MECHANISM. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA FROM CELLULAR FRACTIONATION ANALYSES DEMONSTRATE THAT FORMALDEHYDE EXPOSURE DRAMATICALLY DECREASES LYSINE ACETYLATIONS OF THE CYTOSOLIC HISTONES H3 AND H4. THIS FINDING IS VERY INTRIGUING, GIVEN THAT THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE CRITICAL FOR HISTONE NUCLEAR IMPORT AND CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY. OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS FURTHER SHOW THAT FORMALDEHYDE REDUCES THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF HISTONE IN THE CHROMATIN FRACTION AND THE LEVELS OF HISTONES AT GENOMIC LOCI, SUGGESTING INHIBITION OF CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY.

PRELIMINARY DATA IN SPRAGUE DAWLEY RATS INDICATE THAT MCLR-ELICITED BURNT OUT NASH PERSISTS 4 WEEKS AFTER MCLR EXPOSURE, IN CONTRAST TO THE CONTROL DIET GROUP THAT RETURNED TO A BASELINE PHENOTYPE. IN ADDITION, MCLR PERSISTENTLY DYSREGULATED MATRISOME GENES (RELATED TO FIBROSIS) AND CARCINOGENESIS GENES (DE-DIFFERENTIATION/STEM CELL MARKERS) IN NASH. BASED ON THESE DATA WE HYPOTHESIZE MCLR-MEDIATED FIBROTIC AND CARCINOGENIC REPROGRAMMING OF THE LIVER IS ENHANCED IN NASH AND PROMOTES THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIRRHOSIS AND HCC. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED IN TWO AIMS. AIM 1 WILL DETERMINE THE ROLE OF THE PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A (PP2A)-ASSOCIATED PATHWAYS IN MCLR-MEDIATED STELLATE CELL ACTIVATION AND HEPATOCYTE DE-DIFFERENTIATION. CONSIDERING THE LIVER IS THE PRIMARY TARGET FOR MCLR, THERE IS SURPRISING PAUCITY OF RESEARCH INVESTIGATING THESE PATHWAYS AND NONE HAVE EXAMINED THE CELL TYPE SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF PP2A.

STUDY 1.2 WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT HEPATOCYTES ARE THE PRIMARY MCLR TARGET AND STELLATE CELLS ARE ACTIVATED BY HEPATOCYTE DAMAGE USING HEPARG AND LX2 CELLS CULTURED INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATION IN TRANSWELL PLATES. STUDY 1.3 WILL DEFINE THE EFFECTS OF PP2A- PATHWAY MODULATORS ON MCLR- AND NASH DIET-ELICITED LIVER PATHOLOGY IN RATS FED EITHER A CONTROL OR A NASH DIET. AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE THE MECHANISMS AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF MCLR-ELICITED FIBROTIC AND CARCINOGENIC REPROGRAMMING ON CIRRHOSIS AND HCC DEVELOPMENT IN HEALTHY VERSUS NASH.

HOWEVER, EPIGENETIC REGIONS THAT ALTER OBESITY RISK ARE STILL LARGELY UNKNOWN, AND THE CURRENT LACK OF A SCREENING TOOL FOR COMPREHENSIVE MEASUREMENT OF EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS HAMPERS THE IDENTIFICATION OF ASSOCIATED REGIONS. SUCH A SCREEN THAT COULD ALSO BE APPLIED TO ANY DISEASE OR EXPOSURE OF INTEREST WOULD BE OF GREAT UTILITY FOR A BROAD RANGE OF HUMAN HEALTH STUDIES. THE INTERPRETATION OF HUMAN EPIGENETIC DATA GENERATED USING GENOME-SCALE APPROACHES IS HAMPERED BY SEVERAL OBSTACLES. FIRSTLY, THE AVAILABLE DATA ARE LARGELY BASED ON METHYLATION DIFFERENCES MEASURED IN DNA OBTAINED CROSS-SECTIONALLY AT DIFFERENT AGES THROUGHOUT THE LIFE COURSE, YET DNA METHYLATION MARKS ARE KNOWN TO VARY BY AGE. SECONDLY, METHYLATION MEASUREMENTS ARE MADE IN ACCESSIBLE PERIPHERAL CELL TYPES ACCESSIBLE FROM OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, AND VARIABILITY OF EPIGENETIC MARKS BETWEEN CELL TYPES MEANS THAT MEASUREMENTS FROM THESE CELLS DO NOT ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH THOSE FROM CELL TYPES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO DISEASES. FINALLY, ALTERATION TO EPIGENETIC MARKS CAN BE CAUSED BY DISEASE, AND THIS TEMPORAL AMBIGUITY BETWEEN EXPOSURE AND OUTCOME COMPLICATES CAUSAL INFERENCE. TO OVERCOME THESE OBSTACLES, WE HAVE COMPREHENSIVELY IDENTIFIED DNA METHYLATION- CONTROLLED REGULATORY REGIONS FOR GENOMICALLY IMPRINTED GENES, MAPPING THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE HUMAN \u201cIMPRINT-OME\u201d.

SO FAR, PUBLISHED SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT ENVIRONMENTALLY INDUCED EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS, MAINLY DNA METHYLATION, HISTONE MODIFICATIONS, AND RNA MODIFICATIONS (EPITRANSCRIPTOME), ARE TRANSMITTED TO SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS VIA GERMLINE (EGGS OR SPERM)1.

HERE IN THE PROPOSED STUDY, WE ARE ASKING THREE BIG QUESTIONS: A) DO GERMLINE EPIMUTATIONS ESTABLISH AGE AND DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE SPECIFICALLY IN MALES? B) DO ANCESTRALLY ESTABLISHED TRANSGENERATIONAL EPIMUTATIONS PREDISPOSE FUTURE GENERATIONS TO INCREASED RISKS FOR REPRODUCTIVE IMPAIRMENT IF EXPOSED AGAIN TO EMERGING ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS OF CONCERN?

UP TO 40-55% OF E-LIQUID CONTENT IS CONVERTED TO DHA IN EACH PUFF FROM AN E- CIGARETTE, MAKING DHA A HIGH-VOLUME COMPONENT FOUND IN ALL E-CIGARETTE VAPORS, WHICH THE VAPER INHALES WITH EACH PUFF OF THE E-CIGARETTE. DHA IS APPROVED FOR EXTERNAL USE AS A SUNLESS TANNING AGENT, BUT SERIOUS CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT INHALATION EXPOSURES THROUGH SPRAY TANNING AND NOW E-CIGARETTE USE.

THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THE PROPOSAL IS THE IDENTIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF MARKERS FOR CELLULAR AND METABOLIC STRESS INDUCED BY DHA EXPOSURE THAT CAN BE EXAMINED IN TISSUES FROM VAPERS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF REPEATED INHALATION EXPOSURES TO DHA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THE GAP IN EXISTING STUDIES, WHICH HAVE ONLY FOCUSED ON SKIN MODELS, BY EXAMINING THE EXPOSURE EFFECTS OF DHA AT BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC DOSES IN PULMONARY AND CARDIOVASCULAR CELLS. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT EXPOSURE TO DHA ALTERS METABOLIC PATHWAYS, PROMOTES OXIDATIVE STRESS, DISRUPTS CA2+ HOMEOSTASIS, AND LEADS TO MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS WORK IS THAT DHA EXPOSURES TO THE LUNG AND CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM ALLOW DIRECT ABSORPTION OF DHA INTO CELLS. DHA-INDUCED CHANGES IN METABOLISM AND MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION WOULD COMPROMISE OVERALL CELLULAR FUNCTION, LEADING TO DISEASE. THREE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS: 1) DHA INCORPORATION INTO METABOLIC PATHWAYS ALTERS GLYCOLYSIS AND INDUCES GLYCOSYLATION PROTEIN DAMAGE; 2) DHA EXPOSURE ALTERS NAD(P)H POOLS INDUCING OXIDATIVE STRESS, AND 3) DHA EXPOSURE ALTERS CYTOSOLIC CA2+ LEVELS AND DISRUPTS MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION.

THE RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE E-CIGARETTE USERS ARE CHRONICALLY EXPOSED TO DHA, WHICH WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT PULMONARY AND CARDIOVASCULAR CELL HOMEOSTASIS AND CAUSE SEVERE DECLINES IN CELLULAR FUNCTION OR EVEN INDUCE CELL DEATH.

ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS, PARTICULARLY ENVIRONMENTALLY UBIQUITOUS OBESOGENS SUCH AS PER- AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFAS), ARE THOUGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE RAPID INCREASES IN OBESITY. INDEED, PRENATAL PFAS EXPOSURES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TO GENDER-SPECIFIC OBESITY DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN. INTERESTINGLY, PFAS EXPOSURES THAT OCCUR DURING PREGNANCY CAN CROSS THE PLACENTA LEADING TO DIRECT IN UTERO EXPOSURE, AND PFAS HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN PLACENTAL TISSUES. IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING FETAL GROWTH, THE PLACENTA IS LIKELY INVOLVED IN LONGER TERM PERSISTENT EFFECTS IN THE OFFSPRING. HOWEVER, INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PRENATAL PFAS, IMPACTS ON THE PLACENTA, AND POSTNATAL GROWTH AND METABOLIC HEALTH ARE UNDERSTUDIED. ADDITIONALLY, A LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION INCLUDING DIETARY TRAINING, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATIONS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ATTENUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HIGHER PFAS TO HIGHER BODY WEIGHT. HOWEVER, SIMILAR STUDIES HAVE NOT BEEN PERFORMED IN THE CONTEXT OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE AND CHILDREN\u2019S HEALTH OUTCOMES.

OUR GOAL IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE PATHWAYS OF METABOLISM AND TRANSPORT OF BACS AND THEIR IMPACT ON NEPHROTOXICITY OF BACS. THE POTENTIAL FOR NEPHROTOXICITY IS SUPPORTED BY PREVIOUS STUDIES IN RATS SHOWING THAT BACS ACCUMULATE TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE KIDNEY AFTER ORAL INTAKE AND OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES SHOWING THAT BACS EXERT POTENT CYTOTOX- ICITY IN A 3D \u201cKIDNEY-ON-A-CHIP\u201d MICROPHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEM (MPS).

ADDITIONALLY, IDENTIFICATION OF NEW MARKERS THAT ARE MORE CLOSELY LINKED TO MECHANISM OF ACTION WILL ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF MECHANISM AND IMPROVE THERAPEUTICS. OUR APPROACH TO IDENTIFICATION OF SUCH MECHANISTIC MARKERS HAS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE MITOCHONDRIA AS COMMON, EARLY, AND SENSITIVE TARGETS IN PROXIMAL TUBULAR CELLS FOR AN ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS AND THERAPEUTIC DRUGS. WE WILL USE PRIMARY CULTURES OF PROXIMAL TUBULAR CELLS FROM HUMAN KIDNEYS (HPT CELLS) AS THE EXPERIMENTAL MODEL SYSTEM. OUR OVERALL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT EXPOSURE OF HPT CELLS TO ENVIRONMENTALLY OR THERAPEUTICALLY RELEVANT CONCENTRATIONS OF TOXICANTS OR THERAPEUTIC AGENTS, RESPECTIVELY, WILL MODIFY MITOCHONDRIA AND OTHER CELLULAR COMPONENTS AND RESULT IN RELEASE OF SELECTED PROTEINS AND LIPIDS AND ALTERED PATTERNS OF METABOLITES. ALTHOUGH ASSOCIATION OF MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION WITH VARIOUS FORMS OF KIDNEY INJURY AND DISEASE IS WELL-ESTABLISHED, OUR APPLICATION OF THIS CENTRAL, UNDERLYING CONCEPT TO IDENTIFY MECHANISTICALLY-BASED BIOMARKERS IS NOVEL. HPT CELLS WILL BE TREATED WITH TWO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS (THE TRICHLOROETHYLENE METABOLITE S-(1,2-DICHLOROVINYL)-L-CYSTEINE [DCVC] AND HGCL2) OR THREE THERAPEUTIC AGENTS (TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE, CISPLATIN, AND POLYMYXIN B) THAT ALL TARGET RENAL MITOCHONDRIA. ADDITIONALLY, ANTIMYCIN A WILL BE USED AS A POSITIVE CONTROL. PRELIMINARY STUDIES HELPED REFINE THE HYPOTHESIS AND IDENTIFIED THREE SPECIFIC PROTEINS, ONE MITOCHONDRIAL (SULFITE OXIDASE), ONE CYTOSKELETAL (KERATINS), AND ONE CYTOPLASMIC (HSP90), AS POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS AND TAKE A TARGETED APPROACH FOR VALIDATION. SPECIFIC AIM 1 WILL TAKE A TARGETED APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE UTILITY OF RELEASED PROTEINS FROM HPT CELLS AS BIOMARKERS. WE WILL TEST WHETHER RELEASE OF MITOCHONDRIAL SULFITE OXIDASE, CYTOSKELETAL KERATINS, AND CYTOPLASMIC HSP90 REFLECT EXPOSURE TO AND PROXIMAL TUBULAR TOXICITY FROM NEPHROTOXICANTS. RELEASE OF PROTEINS WILL BE CORRELATED WITH PARAMETERS OF RENAL CELL FUNCTION AND VIABILITY AND OTHER WELL-ESTABLISHED BIOMARKERS. SPECIFIC AIM 2 WILL FOCUS ON MODIFIED (ADDUCTED OR OXIDIZED) PROTEINS IN HPT CELLS AS BIOMARKERS. SPECIFIC AIM 3 WILL FOCUS ON RELEASE OF CARDIOLIPINS, OTHER LIPIDS, AND INTERMEDIARY METABOLITES AS SENSITIVE INDICATORS OF EXPOSURE TO AND PROXIMAL TUBULAR TOXICITY FROM NEPHROTOXICANTS. FINALLY, SPECIFIC AIM 4 WILL FOCUS ON THE POTENTIAL IDENTIFICATION OF PROTEINS IN EXPOSOMES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED IN AIMS 1 AND 2, AS ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF SENSITIVE MARKERS OF EXPOSURE AND INJURY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id":

THESE NEW DAILY MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR 2007-2023 AT A <1 KM RESOLUTION AND THUS INCLUDE BILLIONS OF POINT-DAY TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, AND PARTICULATE MATTER ESTIMATES.

CURRENT TREATMENT OP- TIONS FOR IUGR PATIENTS ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED, FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON EARLY DELIVERY; THUS, PUTTING THE MOTHER AND CHILD AT RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PRETERM BIRTH. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT PREGNANT WOMEN EXPOSED TO FINE PARTICULATE MATTER (PM) HAVE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF FETAL LOSS AND DEVELOPMENT OF IUGR.

WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DIELDRIN-INDUCED EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS DURING DEVELOPMENT CAUSE CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION AND PHENOTYPE THAT PERSIST INTO ADULTHOOD, ALTERING THE SENSITIVITY TO PARKINSONIAN INSULTS AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PD. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE WILL DETERMINE CELL-TYPE SPECIFIC DNA MODIFICATIONS AND EXPRESSION PROFILES OF PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED CANDIDATE GENES IN THE DIELDRIN MODEL (AIM 1); ANALYZE THE FUNCTION OF SYNAPTIC TERMINALS IN OUR NOVEL DIELDRIN/PFF TWO-HIT MODEL (AIM 2); AND DETERMINE IF DIELDRIN OR ALTERED EXPRESSION OF CANDIDATE GENES AFFECTS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO A-SYN PFFS IN A DOPAMINERGIC NEURON CELL CULTURE MODEL (AIM 3). THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THESE EXPERIMENTS IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER DIELDRIN-ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED GENES PLAY A FUNCTIONAL ROLE IN THE BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO PARKINSONIAN TOXICITY. COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL FURTHER THE MISSION OF NIEHS TO INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS PEOPLE IN ORDER TO PROMOTE HEALTHIER LIVES, WITH A SPECIFIC PROJECT GOAL OF CONNECTING EXPOSURES WITH FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION, NEURONAL PHENOTYPE, AND PD SUSCEPTIBILITY. THE EXPERIMENTS PROPOSED HERE WILL HELP TO ESTABLISH A BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM LINKING DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE TO LATE LIFE DISEASE. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO EXPAND OUR REPERTOIRE OF TOOLS FOR INTERROGATING THE FUNCTION OF EPIGENETIC CHANGES BY ESTABLISHING AN IN VITRO EXPERIMENTAL PARADIGM TO CONNECT SPECIFIC EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS WITH PARKINSONIAN TOXICITY. WITH OUR IN VIVO MODEL THAT COMBINES DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE WITH ADULT PFF INJECTIONS, WE WILL HAVE A SET OF EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS IN PLACE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO TEST A WIDE VARIETY OF EXPOSURES, AS WELL AS COMBINATIONS OF EXPOSURES, BOTH IN VIVO AND IN VITRO. TOGETHER, THIS SUITE OF TOOLS WILL ENABLE US TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH PD- RELATED EXPOSURES ALTER NEURONAL VULNERABILITY IN PD, FURTHERING THE GOAL OF NIEHS TO UNDERSTAND HOW COMBINED EXPOSURES AFFECT DISEASE PATHOGENESIS AND INDIVIDUAL SUSCEPTIBILITY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NJ", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f360f59f-4329-903a-affb-d7870b1503be-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES031237_7529"}, {"internal_id": 95484670, "Award ID": "R01ES031173", "Award Amount": 699750.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-02-24", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "PM EXPOSURE AND CHANGES IN RESPIRATORY HOST DEFENSE RESPONSES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f371179b-9f27-8013-f81c-4fd314b1f981-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES031173_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110464534, "Award ID": "R01ES031139", "Award Amount": 1884635.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-16", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PRENATAL OBESOGEN EXPOSURE AND TOTAL WESTERN DIET LEAD TO A TRANSGENERATIONAL THRIFTY PHENOTYPE: FUNCTIONAL AND EPIGENOMIC ANALYSIS OF EFFECTS IN FAT AND LIVER", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0b710df3-c98e-f245-bbed-8bbbc32a803b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES031139_7529"}, {"internal_id": 107114559, "Award ID": "R01ES031127", "Award Amount": 1951379.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-07-28", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL STYRENE AND BTEX EXPOSURE IN A GULF OF MEXICO COHORT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f371179b-9f27-8013-f81c-4fd314b1f981-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES031127_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110863549, "Award ID": "R01ES031124", "Award Amount": 1329841.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-25", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "ATP13A2 AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEURODEGENERATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b2c67eb1-1a52-5e22-5ef6-ce5521ce52c0-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES031124_7529"}, {"internal_id": 94714377, "Award ID": "R01ES031117", "Award Amount": 2677338.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-01-24", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL MIXTURES AND METABOLOMICS IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bace221f-a1f9-fa20-66e4-55984406cf48-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES031117_7529"}, {"internal_id": 109189968, "Award ID": "R01ES031106", "Award Amount": 3017310.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-15", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "MICROBIOME, ENVIRONMENT, AND PARKINSONS DISEASE (MEP) PESTICIDE EXPOSURES AND THE GUT MICROBIOME IN PARKINSONS DISEASE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3231cda5-201a-6da0-de9e-e9810a848983-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES031106_7529"}, {"internal_id": 94713971, "Award ID": "R01ES031098", "Award Amount": 2505458.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-01-31", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "PCB-MEDIATED DYSBIOSIS OF THE GUT MICROBIOME: A MISSING LINK IN PCB-MEDIATED NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS?", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0b441d38-e3c0-de89-ee08-69fc9e6ee58a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES031098_7529"}, {"internal_id": 147669719, "Award ID": "R01ES031087", "Award Amount": 675000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-01-13", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "UVB RADIATION-GENERATED MICROVESICLE PARTICLES AS EFFECTORS FOR PHOTOSENSITIVITY - ABSTRACT ULTRAVIOLET B (UVB) RADIATION HAS PROFOUND EFFECTS UPON SKIN AND GENERATES SYSTEMIC CONSEQUENCES FROM FEVER TO IMMUNOSUPPRESSION TO VITAMIN D PRODUCTION. AS UVB ONLY PENETRATES THE EPIDERMIS, A MAJOR UNANSWERED QUESTION IN PHOTOBIOLOGY IS HOW UVB-TREATED EPIDERMAL SKIN SENDS SYSTEMIC SIGNALS. RECENT STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT SMALL MEMBRANE-BOUND VESICLES KNOWN AS MICROVESICLE PARTICLES (MVP) RELEASED FROM CELLS IN RESPONSE TO VARIOUS STRESSORS CAN ACT AS POTENT SIGNALING AGENTS DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO CARRY NUCLEAR AND CYTOPLASMIC COMPONENTS. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT UVB GENERATES MVP RELEASE FROM EPITHELIAL CELLS AND SKIN, WHICH COULD PROVIDE A POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR UVB-MEDIATED SYSTEMIC SIGNALING. OUR GROUP AND OTHERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT UVB RADIATION GENERATES HIGH LEVELS OF THE LIPID MEDIATOR PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR (PAF) PRODUCED ENZYMATICALLY AND PAF-RECEPTOR (PAFR) AGONISTS PRODUCED NON-ENZYMATICALLY VIA REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES. OUR ONGOING STUDIES USING ANTIOXIDANTS AND PAFR-EXPRESSING/NULL CELL LINES AND PHARMACOLOGIC/GENETIC INHIBITION OF THE ENZYME ACID SPHINGOMYELINASE (ASMASE) HAVE IMPLICATED INVOLVEMENT OF PAFR SIGNALING RESULTING IN ASMASE ACTIVATION IN UVB GENERATED MVP (UVB-MVP). FINALLY, WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT UVB-MVP DO NOT CARRY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PROTEIN CYTOKINES, YET CARRY BIOACTIVE PAF AGONISTS. WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT METABOLICALLY LABILE PAF AGONISTS ARE PROTECTED TRAVELING IN MVP AND THESE BIOACTIVE LIPIDS ARE INVOLVED IN ACUTE PRO-INFLAMMATORY AND DELAYED IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE EFFECTS OF UVB. YET KNOWLEDGE GAPS EXIST AS TO HOW UVB-MVP ARE GENERATED AND IF THIS NEW PATHWAY CAN BE EXPLOITED TO TREAT PHOTOSENSITIVITY DISEASES. TWO AIMS ARE DESIGNED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT UVB GENERATES MVP IN HUMAN SKIN IN A PAF-DEPENDENT MANNER INVOLVING ASMASE AND TRANSFERS BOTH LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC EFFECTS VIA THEIR CARRIED PAF AGONISTS. AIM 1 WILL USE IN VITRO CELL LINES AND MURINE GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGIC MODELS TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISMS OF UVB-MVP GENERATION. THIS AIM WILL VALIDATE TOOLS TO DEFINE THE ROLES OF UVB- MVP IN ACUTE PRO-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS OF UVB, USING A MURINE MODEL OF PHOTOSENSITIVITY THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED IS PAF-DEPENDENT AND A SEPARATE PHOTOSENSITIVE MURINE LUPUS MODEL. AIM 2 WILL USE BOTH EX VIVO SKIN EXPLANTS AND IN VIVO HUMAN SUBJECTS TO TEST THE ABILITY OF HUMAN SKIN TO GENERATE UVB-MVP. MOREOVER, WE WILL DEFINE IF ORAL ANTIOXIDANTS AND TOPICAL ASMASE INHIBITOR TREATMENTS WILL BLOCK UVB-MVP GENERATION AND UVB-MEDIATED ACUTE INFLAMMATION IN HUMANS. FINALLY, WE WILL TEST IF HUMAN SUBJECTS EXHIBITING CLINICAL PHOTOSENSITIVITY RESPOND TO UVB WITH INCREASED UVB-MVP AND IF A TOPICAL ASMASE INHIBITOR BLOCKS THE UVB-MVP AND THE EXAGGERATED SKIN REACTIONS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL (I) ADDRESS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IN PHOTOBIOLOGY AS TO HOW A KERATINOCYTE-SPECIFIC STIMULUS CAN GENERATE SYSTEMIC SIGNALING EFFECTS, (II) OFFER PHARMACOLOGIC MECHANISMS TO BLOCK UVB LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC EFFECTS.

TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, STUDIES HAVE NOT EXAMINED THE HEALTH IMPACT OF EXPOSURES TO VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) AMONG HISPANIC WOMEN WHO BOTH LIVE IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NEIGHBORHOODS AND WORK AS DOMESTIC CLEANERS.  DESPITE THEIR LARGE NUMBERS IN THIS COUNTRY, US LABOR LAWS GENERALLY EXCLUDE DOMESTIC CLEANERS AND THUS THEY HAVE LIMITED PROTECTIONS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS: ORGANIZE, EARN MINIMUM WAGE OR OVERTIME PAY, HAVE REGULAR BREAKS, AND A HEALTHY AND SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN TEXAS (TX) WHICH RANKS AMONG THE STATES WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF THESE WORKERS, YET THEIR ANNUAL MEAN WAGE IN TX IS AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE NATION. ALSO, DOMESTIC CLEANERS, PARTICULARLY IN SOUTH TEXAS, ARE OVERWHELMINGLY MINORITIES AND ARE PRIMARILY HISPANIC OR LATINA WOMEN.  WOMEN WORKING AS DOMESTIC CLEANERS ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS. FOR EXAMPLE, EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN CLEANING PRODUCTS, SUCH AS VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS), WHICH HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH RESPIRATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., WHEEZE, ASTHMA, UPPER/LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT IRRITATION). VOCS ARE ALSO UBIQUITOUS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE INDOOR AND NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENTS REPRESENT IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF TOTAL PERSONAL EXPOSURE, EVEN AMONG OCCUPATIONALLY EXPOSED PERSON. THUS, IN ADDITION TO WORK-RELATED VOC EXPOSURE, HISPANIC WOMEN WORKING AS DOMESTIC CLEANERS MAY EXPERIENCE `DOUBLE JEOPARDY', WITH POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT VOC EXPOSURES IN THEIR HOME ENVIRONMENTS.

LEPTIN ACTS VIA LEPTIN RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN TO MODULATE MANY NEURONAL FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING NEURONAL ACTIVITY, NEUROGENESIS, AXONAL GROWTH, AND SYNAPTIC STRENGTH. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF RECENT STUDIES ALSO HIGHLIGHT A ROLE OF LEPTIN LEVELS FOR THE ONSET OR PROGRESSION OF BRAIN DISORDERS LIKE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE (E.G. ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE), LEARNING AND MEMORY DEFICITS, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, MENTAL ILLNESS (E.G. DEPRESSION) AND NEUROPATHIC PAIN.  THE PRECISE REGULATION OF THE DYNAMIC CHANGES IN CIRCULATING LEPTIN, WHICH IS ALSO CONSIDERED AN INTEROCEPTIVE SIGNAL, ARE AT THE CORE TO MAINTAIN NORMAL NEURONAL FUNCTION IN BOTH THE CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS.  PREVIOUS WORK FROM OTHERS HAS SHOWN THAT SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION OF ADIPOSE TISSUE SUPPRESSES THE PRODUCTION AND SECRETION OF LEPTIN. HOWEVER, THE PRECISE NATURE OF THE NEURONAL POPULATIONS INVOLVED IN THE SYMPATHETIC REGULATION ARE NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD. ALSO, IT REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN HOW THE SYMPATHETIC PATHWAYS INTERACT WITH OTHER PATHWAYS LIKE THERMO AND ENERGY-NEED SENSORY SIGNALS, THAT SOMETIMES PROMOTE OPPOSING EFFECTS TO INCREASE OR DECREASE ENERGY EXPENDITURE. OUR PREVIOUS WORK DEMONSTRATES THAT DISTINCT LEPTIN TARGET SITES IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS ARE INVOLVED IN THERMO AND ENERGY NEED SENSORY SIGNALS VIA SYMPATHETIC ADIPOSE TISSUE ACTIVATION TO REGULATE ENERGY EXPENDITURE. YET, THE NECESSITY AND SUFFICIENCY OF ADIPOSE TISSUE SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION TO CONTROL LEPTIN LEVELS AND METABOLIC FUNCTION HAS NOT BEEN DIRECTLY STUDIED.

MECHANISTIC STUDIES FROM BONE ORGAN AND CELL CULTURE SYSTEMS SUGGEST CADMIUM (CD) MOBILIZES BONE MINERALS FROM SKELETAL TISSUE. CD IS A HEAVY METAL AND NATURAL ELEMENT FOUND IN SOIL, WITH INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS LINKED TO PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS AND SEWAGE SLUDGE FOUND IN CROPLANDS. AS A RESULT, HUMAN DIETARY EXPOSURES HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME BY 26% DATING FROM 1990 THROUGH 2003. IN ADDITION, CD HAS INCREASED IN HUMAN BONES TEN- FOLD SINCE PRE-INDUSTRIAL TIMES. FOLLOWING INTAKE, CD IS STORED IN THE KIDNEY, WHERE IT REMAINS FOR DECADES (HALF- LIFE: 10-30 YEARS). A SMALL PORTION OF CD IS SLOWLY EXCRETED IN THE URINE, MAKING URINARY CD (U-CD) A WELL- ESTABLISHED BIOMARKER OF LONG-TERM EXPOSURE. CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES HAVE LINKED CD TO LOW BONE MINERAL DENSITY, OSTEOPOROSIS, AND FRACTURE, SUGGESTING A POTENTIAL POPULATION ATTRIBUTABLE FRACTION OF 30% ASSUMING THERE IS A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP.

THE EXTENSIVE PRESENCE AND HUGE GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE PERTAINING TO NEUROTOXIC EFFECTS AND UNDERLYING MECHANISMS ALONGSIDE A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF SPORADIC CASES IN MAJOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS COMPEL THE DIRE NEED TO INVESTIGATE SUCH COMPOUNDS. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES ON PFOS IN C. ELEGANS HAVE SHOWN DA NEUROTOXICITY, REDUCTION IN MITOCHONDRIAL CONTENT, AND INCREASED REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (SAMMI ET AL., 2019).

BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTISM. HOWEVER, DESPITE BEING ESTIMATED TO ACCOUNT FOR 41% OF AUTISM RISK, WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS OF AUTISM. MOREOVER, CURRENT SYSTEMS THAT WE ARE USING TO STUDY HOW ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCE AUTISM RISK, SUCH AS RODENT MODELS, ARE SLOW AND LABORIOUS, AND THEREFORE NOT SUITABLE FOR CONDUCTING LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATIONS. MY LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTISM. BECAUSE SOCIAL DEFICIT IS ONE OF THE 2 CORE SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM, I DEVELOPED A HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING METHOD TO SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCH FOR CHEMICALS THAT INHIBIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN ZEBRAFISH. USING THIS SYSTEM, I SCREENED 1120 COMPOUNDS, AND IDENTIFIED A GROUP OF COMPOUNDS - TOPOISOMERASE II (TOP2) INHIBITORS - THAT EFFECTIVELY INHIBITED THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN ZEBRAFISH. PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO THE TOP2 INHIBITOR ICRF-193 IN MOUSE ALSO INDUCED BEHAVIORAL DEFECTS RELATED TO THE TWO CORE SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS GRANT IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE ROLE OF TOP2 IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. TOP2 IS INVOLVED IN GENE REGULATION DURING BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. ITS TWO ISOFORMS TOP2A AND TOP2B ARE EXPRESSED IN DIVIDING AND POSTMITOTIC TISSUES, RESPECTIVELY, DURING DEVELOPMENT, AND MODULATE THE EXPRESSION OF DISTINCT SETS OF DEVELOPMENTAL GENES. TOP2 ALSO REGULATES DNA METHYLATION BY BINDING TO UHRF1, A KEY ADAPTER FOR DNMT1. MY PRELIMINARY RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT: 1) TOP2A RATHER THAN TOP2B IS LIKELY TO BE THE BIOLOGICAL TARGET RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SOCIAL DEFICIT PHENOTYPE; 2) CHEMICAL INHIBITION OF DNMTS PHENOCOPIED TOP2 INHIBITION AND INDUCED A SIMILAR SOCIAL DEFICIT PHENOTYPE IN ZEBRAFISH; AND 3) TRANSIENT OVEREXPRESSION OF DNMT1 IN ZEBRAFISH EMBRYOS RESCUED THE SOCIAL DEFICIT PHENOTYPE INDUCED BY TOP2 INHIBITORS. IN ADDITION, PREVIOUS LITERATURES HAVE LINKED HUMAN MUTATIONS IN TOP2A, TOP2B, AND DNMT1 TO INCREASED AUTISM RISK. I THUS PROPOSE THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT TOP2 PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR THROUGH REGULATION OF DNMT1 AND DNA METHYLATION, AND DISRUPTION OF THIS PATHWAY LEADS TO DEFICITS IN SOCIALITY AND OTHER AUTISM-RELATED BEHAVIORS. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, I PROPOSE TO: 1) DETERMINE WHICH TOP2 ISOFORM (TOP2A OR TOP2B) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SOCIAL DEFICIT PHENOTYPE INDUCED BY TOP2 INHIBITION; 2) INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF DNMT1 AND GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL DEFICIT FOLLOWING TOP2 INHIBITION; AND 3) TO SYSTEMATICALLY DISCOVER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR BY SCREENING THE TOX21 LIBRARY.

THIS PATHWAY TO INDEPENDENCE CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD WILL EXPERIMENTALLY TEST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL EXERCISE, THE NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR MANF, AND CHEMICAL TOXICANT-INDUCED NEURODEGENERATION IN THE VERSATILE MODEL ORGANISM CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS. THIS MODEL IS ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THIS QUESTION BECAUSE MANF IS THE ONLY NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR CONSERVED IN NEMATODES, AND MY PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS SWIMMING EXERCISE IN C. ELEGANS CONCOMITANTLY IMPROVES MITOCHONDRIAL HEALTH AND INCREASES MANF EXPRESSION. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT EXERCISE CONDITIONING DECREASES NEURODEGENERATION BY PROTECTING FROM CHEMICAL EXPOSURE-INDUCED ER STRESS AND MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION, AND THAT THIS PROTECTION IS MEDIATED THROUGH THE NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR MANF. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, I WILL SUBJECT WILD-TYPE, MANF- DEFICIENT, AND MANF-OVEREXPRESSING NEMATODES TO EXERCISE CONDITIONING AND/OR NEUROTOXICANT (ROTENONE AND 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE) EXPOSURES. I WILL THEN DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF MANF STATUS ON TOXICANT RESPONSE BY ASSESSING ER STRESS, MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION, AND NEURODEGENERATION IN THE THREE MANF GENETIC BACKGROUNDS VIA THE FOLLOWING AIMS: AIM 1. ASSESS ROLE OF MANF IN EXERCISE-INDUCED PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES; AIM 2. IDENTIFY ROLE OF MANF IN SYSTEMIC CROSSTALK BETWEEN ER STRESS AND MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION AFTER TOXICANT EXPOSURE; AIM 3.

AS EXPOSURE DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT HAS LONG-LASTING EFFECTS ON NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES REPORT THAT PRENATAL AS EXPOSURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRED NEURODEVELOPMENT, THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT TO AS EXPOSURE REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. RECENTLY, ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) STRESS BY ACCUMULATION OF UNFOLDED PROTEINS IN THE ER AND SUBSEQUENT ACTIVATION OF UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) HAVE EMERGED AS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR AS- MEDIATED ADVERSE NEUROLOGICAL OUTCOMES. OUR GENOME-WIDE CRISPR SCREEN IDENTIFIED NOVEL ER SUPPRESSORS OF AS-INDUCED ER STRESS INCLUDING MICRORNA(MIR)-124 AND INDICATED THAT MIR-124 IS PROTECTIVE AGAINST AS- INDUCED ER STRESS/UPR SIGNALING.

MY PRIMARY PROJECT OBJECTIVE IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW AN INDIVIDUAL'S CHOICES INFLUENCE PERSONAL EXPOSURES TO TRAFFIC-RELATED AIR POLLUTANTS (TRAP) AND THE CORRESPONDING ACUTE HEALTH EFFECTS. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT TRAFFIC POLLUTANTS MAY CAUSE UP TO HALF OF ALL AIR POLLUTION RELATED MORTALITIES. DESPITE THE BURDEN FROM SUCH WIDESPREAD, INVOLUNTARY EXPOSURES, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE MAGNITUDE OF PERSONAL EXPOSURES DUE TO COMMUTING EXPOSURES. A COMMUTER'S EXPOSURE IS DEPENDENT ON THE MODE OF TRANSPORT, TIME OF DAY, ROUTE, AND FUEL TYPE. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, BICYCLING, AND WALKING HAVE BEEN PROMOTED AS WAYS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION BY REDUCING THE VEHICLE FLEET, YET FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED HOW EXPOSURES WOULD BE MODIFIED DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION OR THE SUBSEQUENT HEALTH EFFECTS.  IN THIS STUDY, 65 PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ASKED TO UTILIZE TWO MODES OF TRANSPORTATION (CAR AND EITHER BICYCLE, RAIL, OR BUS) DURING THEIR TYPICAL COMMUTE OVER 4 DAYS (TWO DAYS PER MODE). DURING EACH 24-HR PERIOD, THE PARTICIPANTS WILL BE EXAMINED FOR CHANGES IN OXIDATIVE STRESS BIOMARKERS AND ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY ENDPOINTS AND 7+ POLLUTANTS AND NOISE LEVELS WILL BE QUANTIFIED IN REAL-TIME. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXPOSURE LEVELS AND ACUTE HEALTH ENDPOINTS. AN EXAMINATION WILL BE CONDUCTED INTO WHETHER THIS ASSOCIATION IS MODIFIED BY MODE OF TRANSPORT. I WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF THE TIME OF DAY AN INDIVIDUAL CHOOSES TO COMMUTE TO WORK AND EXERCISE OUTDOORS IN A SECOND COHORT OF 75 PARTICIPANTS. SINCE TRAP TENDS TO BE MOST CONCENTRATED DURING TWO RELATIVELY SHORT PERIODS OF TIME (MORNING AND EVENING RUSH HOURS), I HYPOTHESIZE THAT ALTERING THE TIME OF EXPOSURE WILL NOTABLY CHANGE PERSONAL EXPOSURES.  THIS PROJECT WILL BRING IN A KEY COMPONENTS OF THE PERSONAL EXPOSURE PARADIGM, AN INDIVIDUAL'S DECISION- INDUCED REDUCTIONS IN EXPOSURE. WE WILL IDENTIFY MODIFIABLE FACTORS/PERSONAL CHOICES THAT CAN REDUCE EXPOSURES WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF IDENTIFYING WHICH REDUCTIONS IN EXPOSURE CAN LEAD TO MEANINGFUL HEALTH BENEFITS. THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE LIFESTYLE CHOICES THAT CAN REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE INDEPENDENT OF THE AMBIENT AIR QUALITY OR REGULATORY CHANGES.

SEQUENCING GENOMES OF DIFFERENT CANCER TYPES SUGGESTED THAT MUTATION LOADS VARY BETWEEN CELL TYPES AND ACROSS THE BODY. THE VARIATIONS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENTIAL EXPOSURE TO DNA DAMAGING AGENTS AND THE REPLICATIVE POTENTIAL OF THE CELLS. IN ADDITION, MUTATION LOADS DUE TO DNA DAMAGING LESIONS WOULD ALSO BE DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF THE CELLS TO REPAIR DAMAGE IN AN ERROR-FREE MANNER. HOWEVER, THE MUTATION LOADS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND INTRINSIC FACTORS ACROSS CELL TYPES IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT KNOWN. ALSO, IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW POLYMORPHISMS WITHIN DNA REPAIR GENES COMPROMISE REPAIR EFFICIENCY AND ALTER THE MUTATION LANDSCAPE IN CELLS EXPOSED TO ENVIRONMENTAL DNA DAMAGE AS WELL AS IN UNEXPOSED CELLS.

TO ADDRESS THIS GOAL, I WILL EXPLORE THE FOLLOWING AIMS. IN AIM1, I WILL DIRECTLY ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF DNA REPAIR POLYMORPHISMS ASSOCIATED WITH CANCERS ON DNA REPAIR CAPACITY USING ORTHOGONAL SYSTEMS.

MUTATIONS LEADING TO LOSS OF A FUNCTIONAL MBD4 GLYCOSYLASE, HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE CT CHANGES IN CPG DINUCLEOTIDES IN CANCER GENOMES. I WILL TEST IF SNPS THAT ARE PREDICTED TO BE DELETERIOUS TO THE MBD4 PROTEIN ALSO INCREASE MUTATION LOADS AND ALTERING SIGNATURES IN SOMATIC CELLS FROM HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS.

PROSPECTIVE GENETIC RISK EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT (PROGRESS) IN AUTISM CENTER AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY WILL ACCELERATE MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN A DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED NEWBORN COHORT FOCUSED ON EARLY LIFE IDENTIFICATION OF GENOMIC RISK VARIANTS FOR AUTISM, PARENT EXPERIENCE WITH RECEIVING THIS GENETIC INFORMATION, AND THE ANALYSIS OF EARLY NEUROBEHAVIORAL TRAJECTORIES TO PREDICT AUTISM. NEWBORN SCREENING USING GENOMIC SEQUENCING IS A PLATFORM THAT CAN DELIVER GENETIC DIAGNOSES BEFORE AUTISM SYMPTOMS EMERGE \u2013 PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EARLY INTERVENTION BUT ALSO RAISING NUMEROUS QUESTIONS ABOUT FAMILY IMPACT AND APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT OF THE CHILD. ALTHOUGH EARLY INTERVENTION IMPROVES AUTISM OUTCOMES, THERE CURRENTLY ARE NO ESTABLISHED NEUROBEHAVIORAL MARKERS TO PREDICT AUTISM IN GENETICALLY AT-RISK INFANTS. WITH ITS UNIFYING THEME OF ADVANCING EARLY EVALUATION OF GENETIC RISK IN AUTISM: FOUNDATIONS, IMPLICATIONS, AND POTENTIAL, THE PROGRESS CENTER WILL HARNESS EXPERTISE IN GENOMICS, DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE, AUTISM DIAGNOSIS, PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT, AND DATA SCIENCE TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS IN AUTISM RESEARCH. WE WILL LEVERAGE A FUNDED PROJECT PILOTING WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING IN A DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED GROUP OF 100,000 INFANTS IN NEW YORK CITY, ALLOWING US TO IDENTIFY RARE, MONOGENIC (E.G., CHD8) CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RISK FOR AUTISM TO PROSPECTIVELY ENROLL AND LONGITUDINALLY FOLLOW 240 INFANTS AT IDENTIFIED GENETIC RISK (IGR) OF AUTISM (OUT OF ~400 ELIGIBLE) AND A MATCHED GROUP OF 120 INFANTS WITHOUT IDENTIFIED GENETIC RISK (NON-IGR) OF AUTISM (TOGETHER COMPRISING THE PROGRESS COHORT). BECAUSE EXPERIENCES AND ATTITUDES LIKELY VARY ACROSS RACE, ETHNICITY, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, OUR DIVERSE, POPULATION-BASED COHORT WILL MAXIMIZE GENERALIZABILITY OF OUR FINDINGS. THE THREE PROPOSED CENTER RESEARCH PROJECTS ARE BUILT AROUND THIS COHORT. PROJECT 1 WILL IDENTIFY GENES AND GENETIC VARIANTS TO IMPROVE AUTISM RISK PREDICTION BY USING LARGE EXISTING GENOMIC DATASETS AND PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATE GENOMIC RISK PREDICTION IN THE PROGRESS COHORT. PROJECT 2 WILL EXAMINE THE IMMEDIATE AND LONGER-TERM IMPACT OF RECEIVING GENETIC INFORMATION ON PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTION AND PARENTAL SELF-EFFICACY IN PARENTS OF PROGRESS COHORT INFANTS. PROJECT 3 WILL IDENTIFY EMERGING NEUROBEHAVIORAL TRAJECTORIES AND ASSESS THE UTILITY OF THESE TRAJECTORIES IN IMPROVING THE PREDICTION OF LATER AUTISM DIAGNOSIS AMONG IGR INFANTS. THESE INTER-RELATED PROJECTS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY FOUR CORES THAT ALSO WILL BE A RESOURCE OF EXCELLENCE TO LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND GLOBAL AUTISM RESEARCHERS FOR INNOVATIVE ANALYTIC STRATEGIES; RIGOROUS DIAGNOSTIC METHODS; SUPPORT FOR AND ENGAGEMENT OF AUTISM COMMUNITIES IN RESEARCH; AND CAPACITY BUILDING FOR NEW AUTISM RESEARCHERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance

(JHU) PROPOSES THE CREATION OF THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH: ADDRESSING REGIONAL MARYLAND ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF DISEASES (CHARMED). THE STRATEGIC VISION OF THE CENTER IS TO SERVE AS THE NEXUS OF COMMUNITY-ENGAGED ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AT JHU AND IN THE MARYLAND REGION (WASHINGTON DC, BALTIMORE (REFERRED TO AS CHARM CITY) AND PENNSYLVANIA) BY PROVIDING FOCUS, RESEARCH, AND LEADERSHIP FOR PROMOTION OF TRANSFORMATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE RESEARCH THAT WILL IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH. THE OVERARCHING MISSION IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW EXPOSURES TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CAUSE ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THEN TO TRANSLATE THESE FINDINGS INTO ACTION TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN THE MARYLAND REGION. THIS MISSION HAS BEEN INFORMED BY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE GUIDED BY STRONG PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY LEADERS AND CHARMED MEMBERS (59) DRAWN FROM THE JHU AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AT COLLEGE PARK. THE SYNERGISTIC COMBINATION OF BASIC, POPULATION AND COMMUNITY- ENGAGEMENT SCIENTISTS WITHIN CHARMED PROMOTES TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH THAT ADDRESSES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS AND TRANSLATES KNOWLEDGE INTO ACTION TO HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH IN THE MARYLAND REGION, CONSISTENT WITH THE NIEHS STRATEGIC PLAN. OUR MISSION IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH FIVE AIMS. AIM 1: ADVANCE TRANSLATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH THAT WILL IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE MARYLAND REGION AS IT RELATES TO THE THEMATIC FOCI OF THE CENTER. THE THEMATIC RESEARCH GROUPS ARE: 1) CARDIORESPIRATORY HEALTH AND AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS; 2) CHEMICAL MIXTURES AND EMERGING CONTAMINANTS, AND HEALTH; 3) COMMUNITY, SOCIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH; AND 4) NEUROLOGICAL HEALTH. AIM 2. PROMOTE TRANSLATION OF DATA TO KNOWLEDGE TO ACTION BY CREATING AND STRENGTHENING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND HELP SET THE RESEARCH AGENDA OF CHARMED USING COMMUNITY- ENGAGED RESEARCH APPROACHES (COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE). AIM 3. ESTABLISH AND SUPPORT A FACILITY CORE STRUCTURE [INTEGRATED HEALTH SCIENCES FACILITY CORE (IHSFC), AND EXPOSURE CHARACTERIZATION AND MODELING FACILITY CORE (ECMC)] THAT ENABLES THE MISSION. THE IHSFC WILL PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH HUMAN SUBJECT STUDY DESIGN, AND EMPLOY BIOSTATISTICAL, BIG DATA, AND BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSES AND INTEGRATE \u201cOMICS\u201d INCLUDING METABOLOMICS DATA TO PREDICT ADVERSE OUTCOMES. AIM 4. BUILD CAPACITY IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY THAT INCLUDES FOSTERING (CAREER DEVELOPMENT, CORE WORKSHOPS), AND SUPPORTING (ESI MENTORED SCHOLARS PROGRAM, PILOT FUNDS, ACCESS TO FACILITY CORES) BOTH EARLY STAGE AND SENIOR INVESTIGATORS CONDUCTING COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH FOR THE FIRST TIME.

NM-INSPIRES WILL ENGAGE UNIQUE AND DIVERSE POPULATIONS THROUGH MULTI-DIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION AND PROGRAMS. THE CENTER'S THEME IS METALS, MINING, AND MIXTURES, AND IT WILL SUPPORT NUMEROUS MECHANISTIC AND POPULATION-BASED STUDIES. NM-INSPIRES IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT WILL LEVERAGE SEVERAL ONGOING STUDIES IN NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATIONS AND WILL EXTEND TO CENTER INVESTIGATORS NOVEL OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE CURRENT EXPERTISE IN THE UNM METALS SUPERFUND CENTER, NAVAJO BIRTH COHORT STUDY (NBCS) ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES (ECHO), AND THE NATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH EQUITY CENTER. THE NM-INSPIRES CENTER WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO CENTER AND EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATORS MEMBERS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE OTHER PROGRAMS AND ARE WELL-FUNDED BY NIEHS AND NIH. THE CENTER WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO NEWLY ENGAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE FOUR QUADRANTS OF OUR STATE, INCLUDING COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHWESTERN NM IN PROXIMITY TO ACTIVE MINING, COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHEASTERN NM IN PROXIMITY TO OIL/GAS DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING FRACKING, AND US-MEXICO BORDER HEALTH COMMUNITIES WITH AIR QUALITY ISSUES. BASED ON CURRENTLY FUNDED PROGRAMS, THE CENTER IS ORGANIZED BY MEMBERS INTO FOUR RESEARCH FOCUS GROUPS (RFGS) INCLUDING 1) ENVIRONMENTAL CANCER, 2) IMMUNOLOGY, INFLAMMATION, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, 3) INHALATION AND CARDIOPULMONARY TOXICOLOGY, AND 4) COMMUNICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCES (CIS). THE CIS RFG IS A PARTICULARLY NOVEL APPROACH THAT WILL WORK THROUGHOUT THE CENTER AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE (CEC), TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THROUGH CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE MULTI-MODAL OUTREACH STRATEGIES, INCLUDING ART AND SOCIAL MEDIA. THE CENTER WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE AND NEEDED FACILITY CORE (FC) SERVICES THROUGH ITS INTEGRATED HEALTH SCIENCES FC (IHSFC), BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY FC (BACC), BIOSTATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCES CORE (BDSC), AND CEC. THE CENTER WILL OPERATE A SUBSTANTIAL PILOT PROJECT PROGRAM THAT WILL ENABLE INVESTIGATORS TO TAKE ACTION ON NOVEL IDEAS AND STUDIES TO PURSUE NEW RESEARCH GRANTS. THE HIGHLY INTEGRATED NATURE OF THE CENTER WILL FOSTER NOVEL AND INNOVATIVE RESEARCH PROJECTS, INCLUDING THOSE BROUGHT FORWARD FROM COMMUNITIES. THERE WILL BE BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE MEASURES OF SUCCESS FOR THE CENTER THAT WILL BE ASSESSED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND REPORTED ANNUALLY.

ESTABLISHED OR SUSPECTED NEUROTOXICANTS IN EXPERIMENTAL AND POPULATION SETTINGS. EXPOSURE TO THESE CHEMICALS CAN BE PARTICULARLY HARMFUL IN UTERO, A CRITICAL PERIOD OF FETAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. FOUR MAJOR LITERATURE GAPS EXIST: 1) PROSPECTIVE STUDIES OF IN UTERO EXPOSURE TO THESE CHEMICALS AND CHILD RISK OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS (NDS) ARE LIMITED IN THE U.S, WITH MOST STUDIES FROM PREDOMINANTLY WHITE, EUROPEAN POPULATIONS; 2) DESPITE GROWING EVIDENCE THAT THESE CHEMICALS MAY AFFECT MULTIPLE NDS AND SYSTEMS, MOST STUDIES ARE LIMITED TO A SINGLE ND OUTCOME WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF COMORBIDITIES; 3) EXPOSURES RARELY OCCUR IN ISOLATION, YET COMBINED EXPOSURE ACROSS DIFFERENT CHEMICAL CLASSES REMAIN UNCLEAR LET ALONE CHEMICAL-NUTRITION INTERPLAY (NUTRITION MAY MODIFY CHEMICAL TOXICITIES); 4) MOST CHILDREN\u2019S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH STUDIES FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING RISK FACTORS WITH FEW THAT USE OR DEVELOP SOLUTION-ORIENTED ANALYTIC METHODS THAT CAN DIRECTLY INFORM PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS. TO FILL THESE CRITICAL GAPS, DR. CHOI PROPOSES TO INVESTIGATE METALS AND PFAS IN RELATION TO CLINICIAN-DIAGNOSED NDS CONSIDERING COMORBIDITIES, WHILE EXAMINING NUTRITIONAL MODIFIERS THAT MAY MITIGATE CHEMICAL TOXICITIES AND GENERATING POLICY-RELEVANT EFFECT ESTIMATES VIA SIMULATING INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CHEMICALS AND NUTRITION.

FIRST, CURRENT EXPOSURE ASSESSMENTS WERE TOO COARSE TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THE SHORT-TERM VARIABILITY IN EXPOSURE.

DURING THE MENTORED (K99) PHASE OF THIS PROPOSAL, THE CANDIDATE WILL DETERMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF A NEWLY IDENTIFIED CHROMATIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN, ZNF280A, FOR THE REPAIR OF DNA DAMAGE, IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC REPAIR PATHWAYS WHICH REQUIRE ZNF280A (AIM 1). PRELIMINARY DATA DEMONSTRATES THAT ZNF280A IS RECRUITED TO SITES OF DNA DAMAGE INDUCED BY A VARIETY OF SOURCES INCLUDING IONIZING RADIATION (IR). THE CANDIDATE WILL BUILD UPON THIS DATA TO DETERMINE MECHANISTICALLY HOW ZNF280A ORCHESTRATES DNA REPAIR (AIM 2A) AND ASCERTAIN WHETHER THIS CONTRIBUTES TO THERAPY RESISTANCE IN PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA (PDAC), WHERE INCREASED EXPRESSION OF ZNF280A CORRELATES WITH SIGNIFICANTLY POORER OUTCOME IN PATIENTS (AIM 2B). IMPORTANTLY, WHILE IN THE MENTORED (K99) PHASE, THE CANDIDATE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, APPLYING THESE SKILLS THROUGH MENTORING, DATA PRESENTATION AND WRITING OPPORTUNITIES. DURING THE NON-MENTORED/INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PHASE (R00) OF THE PROJECT, TECHNICAL SKILLS AND REAGENTS DEVELOPED BY THE CANDIDATE DURING THE K99 PHASE WILL BE USED TO ELUCIDATE THE IMPORTANCE OF ZNF280A IN THE 22Q11.2 DELETION HUMAN SYNDROME. ZNF280A RESIDES AT THE 22Q11.2 LOCUS AND PRELIMINARY DATA DEMONSTRATES THAT DEPLETION OF ZNF280A RESULTS IN SPONTANEOUS DNA DAMAGE. THE CANDIDATE WILL THEREFORE INVESTIGATE THE IMPORTANCE OF ZNF280A FOR THE RESOLUTION OF DNA REPLICATION STRESS AND DETERMINE WHETHER THIS CAN MECHANISTICALLY EXPLAIN SOME OF THE FEATURES OF 22Q11.2 DELETION SYNDROME (AIM 2C). IN ADDITION, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW CHROMATIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION IS RE-ESTABLISHED FOLLOWING DNA REPAIR. THEREFORE, IN THE R00 PHASE THE CANDIDATE WILL EXTEND THESE APPROACHES AND UTILIZE THE HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING METHODOLOGY TO IDENTIFY NOVEL CHROMATIN FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE LATE STAGES OF DNA REPAIR (AIM 3). THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL PROVIDE THE CANDIDATE WITH DATA FOR AN EARLY INDEPENDENT PUBLICATION AND PRELIMINARY DATA FOR R-SERIES GRANTS (R21, R01).

IMPORTANTLY, OXIDATIVE STRESS DAMAGES DNA RESULTING IN NUMEROUS LESIONS THAT CAN HALT DNA REPLICATION AND INCREASE MUTAGENESIS. OXIDATIVE STRESS EMANATES FROM VARIOUS ENDOGENOUS SOURCES (METABOLISM, INFLAMMATION, ETC.) BUT ALSO EXOGENOUS ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCES SUCH AS POLLUTION, SMOKING, AND SOLAR ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION (UVR), ARGUABLY THE MOST UNIVERSAL SOURCE OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND DNA DAMAGE HUMANS ENCOUNTER. 8-OXO-DEOXYGUAINE (8OXOG) IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPLE ADDUCTS GENERATED BY OXIDATIVE STRESS, AND WHILE WELL STUDIED IN VITRO, IS HISTORICALLY DIFFICULT TO INVESTIGATE IN CELLS SINCE THE AGENTS USED TO PRODUCE IT (UVA, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, ETC.) ALSO GENERATE OTHER DNA ADDUCTS, STRAND-BREAKS, AND DAMAGE LIPIDS AND PROTEINS THROUGHOUT THE CELL. OUR GROUP HAS DEVELOPED AND PUBLISHED ON A NOVEL FLUOROGEN ACTIVATED PEPTIDE (FAP) WHICH CAN BIND MALACHITE GREEN PHOTOSENSITIZER DYES AND WHEN EXCITED WITH FAR-RED LIGHT, SPECIFICALLY PRODUCES SINGLET OXYGEN. SINGLET OXYGEN IS KNOWN TO HAVE A SHORT HALF-LIFE AND REACTS RAPIDLY WITH GUANINE TO FORM 8OXOG. BY FUSING FAP TO THE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN TRF1, WE WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE SPECIFICITY OF OUR CHEMOPTOGENETIC SYSTEM, AND ITS SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CONTROL. WE HAVE ALSO GENERATED CELL LINES WHICH EXPRESS FAP FUSED TO THE HISTONE H2B (H2B-FAP), ALLOWING FOR GENOME-WIDE PRODUCTION OF 8OXOG. THE OVERALL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT 8OXOG STALLS DNA REPLICATION FORKS, ESPECIALLY AT REPETITIVE DNA SEQUENCES LIKE TELOMERES, REQUIRING THE ACTIVITIES OF ATR, POL , AND PRIMPOL. THIS PROPOSAL IS UNIQUELY POISED TO ADDRESS THIS HYPOTHESIS, AS THE H2B-FAP AND TRF1-FAP TOOLS ARE THE ONLY METHODS AVAILABLE TO SPECIFICALLY INDUCE 8OXOG WITHIN THE HUMAN GENOME. IN ADDITION TO TELOMERES, USE OF THE H2B-FAP TOOL WILL ALLOW FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF OTHER SEQUENCES SENSITIVE TO 8OXOG FORMATION BY EXAMINING THE BINDING OF REPLICATION STRESS RESPONSE FACTORS BY CHIP- SEQ. USING PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, THESE IDENTIFIED SEQUENCES AS WELL AS TELOMERE REPEATS WILL BE STUDIED IN VITRO TO DETERMINE IF THEY STALL REPLICATIVE DNA POLYMERASES. THIS COMBINATION OF BIOCHEMICAL AND CELLULAR REPLICATION STUDIES WILL FILL A CRITICAL GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW 8OXOG IMPACTS REPLICATION FORK INTEGRITY AND CELL FATE. OXIDATIVE STRESS IS LINKED TO VARIOUS DISEASES INCLUDING CANCER, BUT ALSO AGING. HOWEVER, DUE TO ITS PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ATTRIBUTE ANY SPECIFIC OUTCOME TO A PARTICULAR LESION. WHILE THIS STUDY WILL ADVANCE OUR GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF 8OXOG, IT WILL DIRECTLY COMPARE H2B-FAP ACTIVATION WITH UVA (A SPECIFIC SUBSET OF UVR), WHICH INDUCES PYRIMIDINE DIMERS IN ADDITION TO OXIDATIVE STRESS. UVR PROMOTES SKIN CARCINOGENESIS ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF FACTORS SUCH AS POL , THE PROTEIN MUTATED IN THE CANCER PREDISPOSITION SYNDROME, XPV.

EMERGING EVIDENCE POINTS TO TWO KEY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO COGNITIVE DECLINE BEYOND THE UNDERLYING DISEASE PATHOLOGY - EXPOSURE TO 1) ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS SUCH AS ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING COMPOUNDS (EDCS) DURING DEVELOPMENT AND 2) CHRONIC STRESS IN ADULTHOOD. THE INTERACTION OF CHEMICAL EXPOSURE AND STRESS ARE UNKNOWN; BUT TOGETHER MAY EXACERBATE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. FIRST, EDCS EXERT THEIR TOXICITY BY DISRUPTING NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SIGNALING DURING SENSITIVE BRAIN DEVELOPMENTAL PERIODS. NUMEROUS EDC STUDIES HAVE DETECTED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN HUMANS AND ANIMALS. ONE GROUP OF UNDERSTUDIED EDCS ARE ORGANOPHOSPHATE FLAME RETARDANTS (OPFRS) ACTING ON NUCLEAR AND STEROID RECEPTORS LINKED WITH COGNITION. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PERINATAL OPFR EXPOSURE AND COGNITIVE PROCESSING HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED. WE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PERINATAL OPFR EXPOSURE ON NEONATAL AND JUVENILE HYPOTHALAMIC GENE EXPRESSION AND ADULT LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY AND APPROACH/AVOIDANCE BEHAVIORS. SECOND, MENTAL DISORDERS SHARE A COMMON FEATURE: EXPOSURE TO STRESS, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION BY EXACERBATING SYMPTOMS. A COMMON PARADIGM TO RECAPITULATE CHRONIC STRESSORS IN RODENTS IS TO APPLY MILD STRESS FOR 6 WEEKS, KNOWN AS CHRONIC VARIABLE MILD STRESS (CVMS). USING CVMS, THE NEURAL CIRCUITS UNDERLYING MALADAPTIVE EFFECTS OF STRESS INCLUDE CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING FACTOR (CRF) NEURONS. CRF IS CO-RELEASED WITH NOREPINEPHRINE (NE), ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH), AND DOPAMINE (DA), WHICH CONTROL KEY BRAIN REGIONS (HIPPOCAMPUS, PREFRONTAL CORTEX), AND ALL ARE INVOLVED IN COGNITION AND MOOD. BASED ON OUR PRIOR WORK AND THE LITERATURE, I HYPOTHESIZE THAT PERINATAL OPFR EXPOSURE CAN DISRUPT COGNITION, ALONE OR WHEN COMBINED WITH ADULT CHRONIC STRESS EXPOSURE. MY CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT EDCS SUCH AS OPFRS INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPING COGNITIVE AND STRESS NEUROCIRCUITRY POTENTIALLY INDUCING LONG-LASTING FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS IN COGNITIVE PROCESSING AND SENSITIZE ADULTS TO EXPOSURE TO CHRONIC STRESS IN MICE. IN AIM 1 (K99 PHASE), I WILL FIRST DETERMINE IF PERINATAL OPFR EXPOSURE DISRUPTS ADULT COGNITION ON THE BEHAVIORAL LEVEL AND THROUGH ALTERATIONS IN ACH SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION USING ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY.

THE EXTENSIVE PRESENCE AND HUGE GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE PERTAINING TO NEUROTOXIC EFFECTS AND UNDERLYING MECHANISMS ALONGSIDE A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF SPORADIC CASES IN MAJOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS COMPEL THE DIRE NEED TO INVESTIGATE SUCH COMPOUNDS. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES ON PFOS IN C. ELEGANS HAVE SHOWN DA NEUROTOXICITY, REDUCTION IN MITOCHONDRIAL CONTENT, AND INCREASED REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (SAMMI ET AL., 2019). THESE EFFECTS ARE CHARACTERISTIC MANIFESTATIONS IN PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE (PD), WITH CAUSE LARGELY UNKNOWN IN 90% OF SPORADIC PD CASES.

TOXIC METALS, AND SOME ESSENTIAL TRACE ELEMENTS, ARE WELL-KNOWN NEUROTOXICANTS AND HAVE BEEN LINKED TO COGNITIVE DECLINE. EVALUATING THE JOINT ACTIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES MAY ELUCIDATE SHARED PHYSIOLOGIC PATHWAYS AND MAY INFORM POLICY. POPULATIONS WITH DOCUMENTED HEALTH DISPARITIES MAY BE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO SUCH PATHWAYS DUE TO HIGHER CUMULATIVE EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS AND SOCIAL STRESSORS LIKE POVERTY, DISCRIMINATION, OR UNSAFE NEIGHBORHOODS. GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT NOVEL EPIGENETIC MARKERS OF DNA METHYLATION AGE PREDICT A HOST OF AGING-RELATED OUTCOMES. FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED WHETHER ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS, INDIVIDUALLY OR AS A MIXTURE, PREDICT DNA METHYLATION AGE ACCELERATION. TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS, THE CANDIDATE PROPOSES NEW AIMS IN THE BALTIMORE MEMORY STUDY, A STUDY OF COGNITIVE AND CARDIOVASCULAR AGING IN 50- TO 70-YEAR-OLD RESIDENTS OF BALTIMORE, WITH DIVERSITY IN RACE/ETHNICITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER CO-EXPOSURES TO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS AND CONTEXTUAL (NEIGHBORHOOD) STRESSORS ARE LINKED TO COGNITIVE FUNCTION, MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, NOVEL EPIGENETIC BIOMARKERS. IN THE K99 PHASE, DR. MOON WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING BONE LEAD BIOMARKERS AND CHRONIC STRESS MEASURES TO ESTIMATE WHETHER THE CAUSAL ASSOCIATION OF LEAD ON LONGITUDINAL COGNITIVE FUNCTION (AIM 1) OR MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (AIM 2) IS MODIFIED BY EITHER A THEORY-BASED SCALE OF NEIGHBORHOOD PSYCHOSOCIAL HAZARDS OR HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL-AXIS DYSFUNCTION, MEASURED BY SALIVA CORTISOL. TO COMPLETE THESE AIMS AND PREPARE FOR INDEPENDENCE, DR. MOON WILL TRAIN IN FOUR METHODOLOGIC AREAS: COGNITIVE AGING EPIDEMIOLOGY, MIXTURE AND CAUSAL INFERENCE MODELS, CO-EXPOSURES TO SOCIAL STRESSORS, AND EPIGENETICS THROUGH FORMAL COURSEWORK AND MENTORING. THESE TRAINING GOALS WILL BE COMPLETED UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A STRONG MENTORING AND ADVISORY TEAM (DRS. SCHWARTZ, BUCKLEY, GROSS, DEAN, AND LADD-ACOSTA). THIS PATHWAY IN INDEPENDENCE AWARD IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING DR. MOON'S LONG-TERM GOAL OF BECOMING AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR WITH EXPERTISE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF AGING-RELATED DISEASE, PARTICULARLY COGNITIVE AGING OUTCOMES, AND EVALUATING HOW CO-OCCURRING SOCIAL STRESSORS CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH DISPARITIES. IN THE R00 PHASE, DR. MOON WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF STORED BIOSPECIMENS, MEASURING TOXIC AND ESSENTIAL METALS IN URINE AND GENOME-SCALE DNA METHYLATION IN BLOOD. USING THIS NEW DATA, SHE WILL DETERMINE THE INDEPENDENT JOINT AND EFFECTS OF A MIXTURE OF METALS ON COGNITIVE AGING (COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT) (AIM 3) AND ON DNA METHYLATION AGE ACCELERATION (AIM 4). THE PROPOSED TRAINING AND AIMS WILL PROVIDE FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS MUST BE ADDRESSED TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE DISPARITIES IN AGING AND PRELIMINARY DATA TO SUPPORT AN R01 INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF A MIXTURE OF METALS AND CHRONIC STRESSORS ON DNA METHYLATION-BASED BIOMARKERS IN AGING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K99ES031998_7529"}, {"internal_id": 139742654, "Award ID": "K99ES031676", "Award Amount": 101628.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-08-31", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "CHILDHOOD FLUORIDE EXPOSURE AND SLEEP PATTERNS - PROJECT SUMMARY I AM A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES IN NEURO-ENDOCRINE DEVELOPMENT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO RECEIVE TRAINING TO ACQUIRE THE SKILLS NEEDED TO CONTINUE MY ACADEMIC CAREER BY EXAMINING THE ROLE OF CHILD FLUORIDE EXPOSURE IN SLEEP PATTERNS AND MELATONIN PRODUCTION. IN THIS PROPOSAL, I PLAN TO TRAIN WITH AN EXPERT MENTORING TEAM WITH TRANSDISCIPLINARY EXPERTISE COVERING EXPOSURE BIOLOGY, SLEEP DISORDERS, TOXICOLOGY, EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS. SPECIFICALLY, I WILL TRAIN IN 1) EXPOSURE SCIENCE WITH DR. MANISH ARORA 2) CLINICAL SLEEP RESEARCH WITH DR. MICHAEL THORPY, AND 3) TOXICOLOGY WITH DR. ROBERT WRIGHT. I WILL ALSO ACQUIRE EXPERTISE IN EPIDEMIOLOGY AND THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF PEDIATRIC SLEEP WITH DRS. ROSALIND WRIGHT, EMILY OKEN AND KRISTIE ROSS, AS WELL AS BIOSTATISTICS WITH DR. CHRIS GENNINGS. THE PROPOSED FORMAL COURSEWORK AND TRAINING WITH MY MENTORS, ADVISORS AND COLLABORATORS WILL ENABLE ME TO ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NECESSARY TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCHER. FURTHER, IT WILL ENABLE ME TO ACHIEVE MY LONG-TERM CAREER GOAL OF BECOMING AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENTIST INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS IN SLEEP AND NEURO-ENDOCRINE DEVELOPMENT. I PROPOSE TO LEVERAGE BIOSPECIMENS AND COLLECTED MEASURES, INCLUDING URINE, SALIVA, ACTIGRAPHY DATA, AND SELF- REPORTED DAYTIME FATIGUE FROM AN EXISTENT PROSPECTIVE BIRTH COHORT, THE PROGRAMMING RESEARCH IN OBESITY, GROWTH ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL STRESS STUDY. I ALSO AIM TO CONDUCT AN IN-DEPTH CLINICAL STUDY EXAMINING ASSOCIATIONS OF URINE FLUORIDE WITH GOLD STANDARD MEASURES OF SLEEP AMONG ADOLESCENTS. THIS WORK WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING AIMS: 1.) DETERMINE WHETHER CHILDHOOD URINARY FLUORIDE CONCENTRATIONS (CUF) AT 4-5 AND 6-7 YEARS PREDICT SLEEP AND WAKE TIME, SLEEP DURATION AND SLEEP EFFICIENCY (MEASURED VIA ACCELEROMETRY) AND DAYTIME FATIGUE (MEASURED VIA A VALIDATED SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRE) AT LATER AGES; 2.) EXAMINE WHETHER SALIVARY MELATONIN RHYTHMS AT 6-7 YEARS MEDIATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CUF AND SLEEP PATTERNS/DAYTIME FATIGUE AMONG CHILDREN AS ASSESSED IN AIM 1; 3.) DETERMINE WHETHER URINARY FLUORIDE LEVELS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL SLEEP PARAMETERS AND SYMPTOMS OF SLEEP APNEA AMONG ADOLESCENTS ASSESSED AT THE SLEEP- WAKE DISORDERS CENTER AT MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH REPRESENTS THE FIRST STUDY TO EXAMINE WHETHER EARLY CHILDHOOD FLUORIDE EXPOSURE PREDICTS CHANGES IN CHILDHOOD SLEEP PATTERNS, DAYTIME FATIGUE OR MELATONIN RHYTHMS. AS SUCH, IT WILL ADVANCE THE FIELD OF PEDIATRIC SLEEP RESEARCH BY PROVIDING VALUABLE INFORMATION REGARDING A MODIFIABLE POTENTIAL RISK FACTOR FOR PEDIATRIC SLEEP DISTURBANCES. IT WILL ALSO HELP TO INFORM TITRATION OF THE APPROPRIATE DOSE OF FLUORIDE TO MAXIMIZE DENTAL HEALTH EFFICACY AND MINIMIZE RISK.

ESTIMATING LONGITUDINAL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION ON CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE - ABSTRACT THIS APPLICATION FOR A MENTORED QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD HAS BEEN SUBMITTED WITH THE GOAL OF SUPPORTING DR. MALINSKY\u2019S CAREER AS A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCHER AT THE INTERSECTION OF BIOSTATISTICS, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND DATA SCIENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. THE TRAINING AND RESEARCH PLAN BUILD ON DR. MALINSKY\u2019S QUANTITATIVE INTERDISCIPLINARY BACKGROUND IN STATISTICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, IN PARTICULAR HIS EXPERTISE IN CAUSAL INFERENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING. THE OVERARCHING RESEARCH GOAL IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL STATISTICAL METHODS FOR CAUSAL INFERENCE THAT MEET IMPORTANT ANALYTICAL CHALLENGES IN OBSERVATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND APPLY THESE METHODS TO THE STUDY OF AIR POLLUTION AND CHRONIC LUNG DISEASES, USING DATA FROM THE LONGSTANDING MULTI-ETHNIC STUDY OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS (MESA). THE METHODS WILL BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL AMBIENT AIR POLLUTANTS (OZONE, FINE PARTICULATE MATTER, AND OXIDES OF NITROGEN) ON PROGRESSION OF EMPHYSEMA AND DECLINE IN LUNG FUNCTION OVER AN EXTENDED TIME PERIOD. RIGOROUSLY INVESTIGATING THESE RELATIONSHIPS IS IMPORTANT BOTH FOR ADVANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ETIOLOGY AND MECHANISMS UNDERLYING LUNG DISEASE AND TO INFORM REGULATORY POLICIES CONCERNING POLLUTION CONCENTRATION LEVELS. THE FOCUS WILL BE ON EXTENDING AND ADAPTING METHODS FOR CAUSAL INFERENCE FROM OBSERVATIONAL LONGITUDINAL DATA, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED TO ACCOMMODATE TIME-VARYING CONFOUNDING AND QUANTIFY UNCERTAINTY DUE TO UNMEASURED CONFOUNDING, BUT NEVER APPLIED TO COMPLEX LONGITUDINAL DATA ON AIR POLLUTION AND CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE. THESE WILL BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM LUNG DISEASE CONSEQUENCES OF HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES TO AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE LEVELS. AIM 1 OF THE RESEARCH PLAN EXTENDS EXISTING METHODS TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES SPECIFIC TO AIR POLLUTION EPIDEMIOLOGY, NAMELY BY EXPLOITING ADVANCES IN MACHINE LEARNING TO ESTIMATE ROBUST EXPOSURE PROPENSITIES AND FLEXIBLE DOSE-RESPONSE FUNCTIONS. AIM 2 OF THE RESEARCH PLAN LEVERAGES THESE METHODS TO INVESTIGATE HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE AFOREMENTIONED POLLUTANTS AND MEASURES OF LUNG DISEASE IN THE MESA DATA AND IDENTIFY VULNERABLE SUBPOPULATIONS. AIM 3 WILL EXTEND AN APPROACH TO COUNTERFACTUAL SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE STATISTICAL LITERATURE THAT QUANTIFIES UNCERTAINTY DUE TO UNMEASURED CONFOUNDING TO THE SETTING OF MESA AND APPLY THIS APPROACH TO THE MESA DATA. THE APPLICATION DELINEATES PLANS FOR MENTORING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT VIA SUPERVISION AND DIDACTIC INSTRUCTION IN THE AREAS OF AIR POLLUTION SCIENCE, ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, CLIMATE, LONGITUDINAL STUDY DESIGN, AND OTHER TOPICS RELEVANT TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF CREDIBLE ANALYSIS MODELS FOR THE MESA DATA.

CROFT'S ADVANCEMENT AS A PHYSICIAN-RESEARCHER STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION ON THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTION (RVI). SPECIFICALLY, DR. CROFT'S PROPOSED STUDY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MENTORED DEVELOPMENT IN ADVANCED ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY APPROACHES, EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT, IMMUNE SYSTEM TRANSCRIPTOMICS, AND RESEARCH TEAM MANAGEMENT. RVIS ARE A SERIOUS CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN ADULTS. PM2.5 AND COMBUSTION RELATED AIR POLLUTION (BLACK CARBON: A MARKER OF TRAFFIC POLLUTION) HAVE BEEN LINKED TO AN INCREASED RATE OF HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR RVI. HOWEVER, THE IMMUNE MECHANISMS BY WHICH AIR POLLUTION MAY ENHANCE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SEVERE RVIS (I.E. REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION) IN ADULTS REMAINS UNCLEAR. DR. CROFT'S OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE TO AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION INCREASES THE RISK OF A SEVERE DOCUMENTED RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTION IN ADULTS, BY DISRUPTING KEY GENE PATHWAYS (E.G. NF-B AND IFN-) WITHIN THE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, DR. CROFT WILL ENROLL PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED WITH RIGOROUSLY ADJUDICATED, MICROBIOLOGICALLY PROVEN RVI FROM AN ACTIVE R01 STUDY ON IMPROVED DIAGNOSTICS FOR RESPIRATORY INFECTION. IN THIS POPULATION OF PATIENTS WITH RVI, HE WILL THEN LEAD ANALYSES TO EXPLORE WHETHER SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN MULTIPLE AIR POLLUTANT AND SOURCE-SPECIFIC POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RATE OF HOSPITALIZATION FOR SPECIFIC RVIS (E.G. INFLUENZA OR RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS). IN THE SAME POPULATION OF PATIENTS, HE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THESE POLLUTANT EXPOSURES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVATION OR SUPPRESSION OF KEY INNATE IMMUNE PATHWAYS. SPECIFICALLY, USING A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WITH CLINICALLY ADJUDICATED DIAGNOSES OF RVI, HIS STUDY WILL USE A CASE-CROSSOVER DESIGN TO ESTIMATE THE RATE OF RVI HOSPITALIZATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE INCREASES IN THE CONCENTRATION OF PARTICULATE AND GASEOUS POLLUTANTS IN THE PRIOR 28 DAYS (AIM 1). PATIENTS WITH CONFIRMED INFECTION WILL UNDERGO RNA TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD, ALLOWING DR. CROFT TO ALSO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE SAME SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS AND GENE EXPRESSION WITHIN THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM (AIM 2). IN BOTH AIMS, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THIS RESPONSE MAY BE SEX-SPECIFIC, RACE OR ETHNICITY SPECIFIC OR UNIQUE IN PATIENTS WITH COPD OR ASTHMA. THIS STUDY MAY IMMEDIATELY BENEFIT THE CLINICAL COUNSELING OF PATIENTS WITH EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION AND MAY ALSO HELP GUIDE FUTURE AIR QUALITY POLICIES TO MINIMIZE THE RISK TO POPULATIONS VULNERABLE TO RVI.

THE TRANSLATION OF PEDIATRIC AND REPRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IS CRITICAL. IN PARALLEL TO THE RISE OF DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE (DOHAD) PRINCIPLES, PRECISION MEDICINE (PM) HAS EMERGED AS THE NEW APPROACH IN HEALTHCARE. PM SEEKS TO TRANSFORM MEDICAL CARE AND DISEASE PREVENTION BY IDENTIFYING FACTORS THAT MORE RELIABLY PREDICT INDIVIDUAL RISK FOR DISEASE BUT HAS FOCUSED ALMOST SOLELY ON GENETICS, EVEN THOUGH ENVIRONMENT IS CLEARLY A VERY LARGE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. WITH DOHAD PRINCIPLES SUGGESTING THAT EARLY LIFE ENVIRONMENT IS AT THE ROOT OF MOST CHRONIC DISEASES, A LIFE COURSE PERSPECTIVE TO PM AND PEDIATRICS IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND HOW HUMAN HEALTH IS SHAPED BY FETAL AND EARLY CHILDHOOD ENVIRONMENTS. ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES RESULT FROM A MULTITUDE OF ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND MICROBIAL TOXIN-INDUCED SHIFTS IN MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES AND THEIR INTERACTING SYSTEMS. ELUCIDATING AND TRANSLATING THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENT IN HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES SPECIFIC EXPERT TRAINING.

MANY THINGS ARE NEEDED TO REALIZE THIS VISION, BUT ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING IS BUILDING THE PEDIATRIC/PERINATAL TRANSLATIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDED TO LEAD THIS PARADIGM SHIFT. TRANSLATION TO BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES WILL REQUIRE DEVELOPING BROADLY TRAINED CHILD HEALTH PRACTITIONERS ABLE TO ENGAGE IN TRANSDISCIPLINARY (TD) TEAMS THAT EXTEND BEYOND DISCIPLINE-SPECIFIC CONCEPTS, APPROACHES, AND METHODS. WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH THE MOUNT SINAI PROGRAM FOR SCHOLARS IN ENVIRONMENTAL PEDIATRICS, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, AND LIFE COURSE SCIENCE EMBEDDED IN A MATURE TD TEAM SCIENCE LEARNING CULTURE GROUNDED IN THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE MAJOR PROPORTION OF THE VARIABILITY IN HEALTH OUTCOMES IS ENVIRONMENTALLY DRIVEN.

AS A RESULT, UNDERSTANDING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GENETIC DRIVERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO INFORM ETIOLOGY AND TREATMENT OF PD.  THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE HOW ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, SPECIFICALLY PESTICIDES, INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PD AT THE LEVEL OF EFFECTS ON MIDBRAIN DOPAMINERGIC (MDA) NEURONS, A CELL TYPE WHOSE LOSS IS THE HALLMARK OF PD PATHOLOGY. THE WORK IS INFORMED BY A PARADIGM IN WHICH HIGHLY QUANTITATIVE PESTICIDE EXPOSURE DATA FROM A LARGE PD COHORT IN CALIFORNIA IS LINKED TO A SCREENING PLATFORM USING PATIENT STEM CELL (IPSC)-DERIVED MDA NEURONS. FIFTY-THREE PESTICIDES WERE LINKED TO PD WITH THIS METHOD AND TEN PROVED DIRECTLY TOXIC TO MDA NEURONS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL: (1) DEEPLY DISSECT MECHANISMS OF MDA NEURON TOXICITY FOR TOP HITS WITH A FOCUS ON MITOCHONDRIAL AND CYTOSKELETAL CONSEQUENCES OF TRIFLURALIN EXPOSURE; (2) EXPLORE THE ROLE OF GLIA IN MODULATING TOXICITY USING A TRICULTURE APPROACH TO ASK HOW OTHER PD-ASSOCIATED PESTICIDES ALTER ASTROCYTE AND MICROGLIAL BIOLOGY TO INFLUENCE MDA NEURON PATHOLOGY; AND (3) USE POPULATION-LEVEL MODELING OF SPORADIC PD IN A DISH TO BUILD A PLATFORM THAT WILL STRATIFY CELLS FROM ~100 DONORS FUNCTIONALLY BASED ON RESPONSES TO PESTICIDES AND THEN USE COMPUTATIONAL METHODS TO RECONSTRUCT WHICH CELL LINES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED.

MATTHEW MCGRAW IN HIS TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE AS A CLINICIAN SCIENTIST STUDYING THE MECHANISMS OF AIRWAY BASAL CELL DYSFUNCTION IN CHEMICAL-INDUCED BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS (BO). BO IS A DEVASTATING FIBROTIC AIRWAYS DISEASE, MOST COMMONLY SEEN AFTER ORGAN TRANSPLANT. HOWEVER, BO IS BECOMING MORE FREQUENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH INHALATION EXPOSURES TO CERTAIN VIRUSES OR CHEMICALS. ONE OF THE MOST WELL-KNOWN CHEMICALS ASSOCIATED WITH INHALATION-INDUCED BO IS DIACETYL (DA; 2,3-BUTANEDIONE), A HIGHLY REACTIVE DIKETONE FOUND IN FOODS, COFFEE AND E-CIGARETTES. DESPITE DA\u2019S COMMON USE AS A FLAVORING ADDITIVE, THE MECHANISMS OF DA-INDUCED BO REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. CENTRAL TO BO DEVELOPMENT IS INJURY TO THE AIRWAY EPITHELIUM. WHEN INJURED, THE AIRWAY RELIES ON EPITHELIAL PROGENITOR CELLS FOR PROPER REPAIR. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF AIRWAY BASAL CELLS, THE PRIMARY PROGENITOR CELL OF THE HUMAN AIRWAY, IN CHEMICAL-INDUCED BO. TWO PRECLINICAL MODELS OF CHEMICAL- INDUCED BO WERE DEVELOPED FOR THIS APPLICATION. FIRST, RATS EXPOSED CONSECUTIVELY TO DA VAPORS DEVELOPED PERSISTENT HYPOXEMIA, REDUCED WEIGHT GAIN, AND HISTOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF BO. POLY-UBIQUITINATED PROTEINS ACCUMULATED IN RAT AIRWAYS AFTER DA EXPOSURES NOT SEEN IN AIR CONTROLS. SECOND, IN HUMAN AIRWAY EPITHELIAL CELLS EXPOSED TO DA VAPORS, POLY-UBIQUITINATED PROTEINS ACCUMULATED AND CO-LOCALIZED PRIMARILY WITH AIRWAY BASAL CELLS. WITH REPETITIVE DA EXPOSURES, THE ACCUMULATION OF POLYUBIQUITINATED PROTEINS RESULTED IN PROTEOTOXICITY OF AIRWAY BASAL CELLS.

CONCURRENTLY DRINKING WATER CONTAMINANTS HAVE BEEN LINKED WITH EPIDEMIC DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER, OBESITY, DYSREGULATION OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEMS, IMPAIRED MENTAL FUNCTIONS, AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE DISEASES. TOXIC POLLUTANTS IN DRINKING WATER ARE PARTICULARLY HAZARDOUS FOR FETAL AND INFANT HEALTH. THEY ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO HARMFUL CONTAMINANTS BECAUSE THEIR ORGANS AND TISSUES ARE STILL DEVELOPING. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE TARGETED GUT MICROBIOTA AS AN ACTIVE PLAYER OF THAT ASSOCIATION. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THESE IMPAIRMENTS REMAIN POORLY DEFINED DUE TO CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF MICROBIOME-MEDIATED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EXTERNAL FACTORS (I.E., DIET AND CONTAMINANTS) AND HOST METABOLISM. DUE TO THE MASSIVE NUMBER OF ORGANIC MICROPOLLUTANTS, MONITORING USING TARGETED CHEMICAL ANALYSES ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT TO ASSESS DRINKING WATER QUALITY, COVERING ONLY A VERY SMALL SUBSET OF THE CHEMICALS.

FINE PARTICULATE MATTER (PM2.5) IS A KEY COMPONENT OF AIR POLLUTION; IT IS HIGHLY REGULATED AND IS THE COMPONENT OF THE AIR POLLUTION MIXTURE MOST CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY MORTALITY. WHILE EXPOSURE TO PM2.5 IS ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE CARDIOPULMONARY EFFECTS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, ASSOCIATIONS ARE EVEN STRONGER AMONG SUSCEPTIBLE POPULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH PREEXISTING CARDIOVASCULAR OR RESPIRATORY DISEASE. IDENTIFYING SUBGROUPS EXPERIENCING DIFFERENTIAL PM2.5-RELATED HEALTH EFFECTS IS KEY TO INFORMING POLICY AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THERE ARE 38 MILLION PEOPLE WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION WORLDWIDE AND 1.7 MILLION NEW HIV INFECTIONS EACH YEAR. IMPROVEMENTS IN ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY HAVE LED TO LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCIES FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV, BUT OTHER HEALTH RISKS HAVE ARISEN FROM CHRONIC INFECTION. CARDIOPULMONARY DISEASE IS A LEADING CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AMONG PEOPLE WITH HIV DUE TO LONG-TERM INFLAMMATION FROM INFECTION AS WELL AS SOME ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY. FURTHER, PEOPLE WITH HIV MAY BE AT HIGHER RISK FOR ADVERSE CARDIOPULMONARY HEALTH EFFECTS FROM TRADITIONAL RISK FACTORS AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION.

BP EXPOSURE VIA ORAL CONSUMPTION IS UBIQUITOUS IN HUMAN POPULATIONS WITH INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN THE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE. PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO BPS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE NEURODEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIOR OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN IN HUMAN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES AS WELL AS IN RODENT MODELS OF PRENATAL BP EXPOSURE. BPS SUCH AS BPA AND OTHER \u201cBPA-FREE\u201d STRUCTURAL ANALOGS, INCLUDING BPF AND BPS, HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO ACT AS ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS THAT PRIMARILY AFFECT ESTROGEN RECEPTOR SIGNALING. PREVIOUS STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT BPS CAN BIND TO BOTH ESTROGEN RECEPTOR ALPHA (ERA) AND ESTROGEN RECEPTOR BETA TO EXERT EFFECTS ON GENE TRANSCRIPTION. STUDIES USING ANIMAL MODELS AND HUMAN PLACENTAL TISSUE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT BPS CAN CROSS THE PLACENTA AND EXERT EFFECTS DIRECTLY ON THE FETUS. MATERNAL BPS MAY ALSO DISRUPT ESTROGEN-DEPENDENT CHANGES IN THE MATERNAL BRAIN WHICH IMPAIRS POSTNATAL MATERNAL CARE. BOTH PRENATAL BP EXPOSURE AND ALTERED MATERNAL CARE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN DNA METHYLATION LEVELS ACROSS THE GENOME WHICH CAN LEAD TO STABLE CHANGES IN TRANSCRIPT ABUNDANCE OF AFFECTED GENES. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS LINKING PRENATAL BP EXPOSURE AND DNA METHYLATION MODIFICATIONS AT SPECIFIC LOCI ARE NOT WELL-KNOWN. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF ALTERED POSTNATAL MATERNAL CARE ON OFFSPRING WITH PRENATAL BP EXPOSURE HAS BEEN UNDERSTUDIED. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF MY PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL BP EXPOSURE ON DNA METHYLATION MODIFICATIONS AT SPECIFIC LOCI, NOTABLY ESTROGEN RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS (ERES), AND CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN GENE TRANSCRIPTION IN THE NEONATAL RAT BRAIN.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO USE A GROUNDBREAKING POPULATION-SEQUENCING APPROACH TO HARNESS THE NATURAL GENETIC DIVERSITY OF WILD C. ELEGANS IN COMBINATION WITH FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY THE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS OF POLY- AND PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFAS). THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT UNDERLYING GENETIC VARIATION WILL RESULT IN VARIATION IN RESPONSE TO PFAS EXPOSURES, WHICH WILL IDENTIFY UNIQUE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF TOXICITY ACROSS PFAS THAT VARY IN THREE STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES: CHAIN LENGTH, CHAIN COMPOSITION, AND FUNCTIONAL GROUP. THE RATIONALE IS THAT GENERATING TOXICITY DATA TO REGULATE THE >12,000 INDIVIDUAL PFAS CHEMICALS CURRENTLY IN PRODUCTION IS IMPRACTICAL, BUT IDENTIFICATION OF STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS OF PFAS IS LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED RISK ASSESSMENT AND REGULATION OF PFAS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED USING THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF GENETIC ARCHITECTURE ON PFAS TOXICITY IN WILD C. ELEGANS; 2) IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF PFAS STRUCTURE ON GENE REGULATION; AND 3) IDENTIFY GENOMIC VARIANTS THAT CONFER SENSITIVITY AND RESISTANCE TO PFAS EXPOSURES.

KNOWING WHY AND HOW SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE SENSITIVE THAN OTHERS TO ENVIRONMENTAL PERTURBATIONS REMAINS A MAJOR GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF TRAITS FOR WHICH THE GENETIC EFFECTS ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY DEPENDENT. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH A SUBSISTENCE-LEVEL COMMUNITY IN NORTHWEST KENYA, THE TURKANA, WHO VERY RECENTLY INITIATED A TRANSITION FROM A TRADITIONAL LIFESTYLE TO AN URBAN ONE AND ARE IN PARALLEL SHOWING INCREASES IN CARDIOMETABOLIC DISORDERS. I PROPOSE TO STUDY MOLECULAR RESPONSES TO THIS DRASTIC LIFESTYLE CHANGE IN THE CONTEXT OF INFLAMMATORY MECHANISMS THAT CONFER INCREASED RISK FOR METABOLIC DISEASES. FIRST, I WILL IDENTIFY DISRUPTIONS IN COORDINATED BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES FOLLOWING THE SHIFT TOWARD A WESTERN LIFESTYLE, THROUGH THE DETECTION OF METABOLIC GENE NETWORK DISTURBANCES IN PBMCS. NEXT I WILL IDENTIFY GENOMIC REGULATORY (ATAC-SEQ) AND TRANSCRIPTIONAL (RNA- SEQ) RESPONSES TO IN VITRO PRO-INFLAMMATORY STIMULATION IN MONOCYTES, WHEREIN DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES ACROSS THE LIFESTYLE GRADIENT IN THE TURKANA WILL INFORM HOW CHRONIC OBESOGENIC SIGNALING (IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT) ALTERS ACUTE INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES THAT TYPICALLY OCCUR IN RESPONSE TO NUTRITIONAL STATUS.

PFAS ARE HIGHLY RESISTANT TO DEGRADATION, LEADING TO THEIR BIOACCUMULATION IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND IN HUMANS. BECAUSE OF THIS, PFAS ARE CURRENTLY CIRCULATING IN HUMANS AT BLOOD CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE MAGNITUDES HIGHER THAN OTHER LEGACY CONTAMINANTS. EXPOSURE TO PFAS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASE (I.E., INCREASED CIRCULATING CHOLESTEROL), OR MAJOR CLINICAL OUTCOMES RELATED TO ATHEROSCLEROSIS THAT INCLUDE STROKE AND HEART ATTACK. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES HAVE YET REPORTED ON WHETHER EXPOSURE TO PFAS CAN INDUCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS. THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE IF PFAS EXPOSURE INDUCES ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND TO CHARACTERIZE THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS LEADING TO PFAS-INDUCED DEVELOPMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS RISK FACTORS. WE HAVE SHOWN IN OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES THAT LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR DEFICIENT MICE (LDLR -/-) FED AN ATHEROGENIC DIET AND EXPOSED TO A SIMPLE MIXTURE OF 5 ENVIRONMENTALLY RELEVANT PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHXS, AND GENX) FOR 7 WEEKS RESULTED IN INCREASED CIRCULATING CHOLESTEROL AND BILE ACIDS AS WELL AS DECREASED BILE ACID EXCRETION. WE ALSO OBSERVED THAT PFAS EXPOSURE RESULTS IN INDUCTION OF ILEAL BILE ACID TRANSPORTERS, ESPECIALLY THE ILEAL REUPTAKE APICAL SODIUM DEPENDENT BILE ACID TRANSPORTER (ASBT). THEREFORE, THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT PFAS EXPOSURE INDUCES ATHEROSCLEROSIS THROUGH MECHANISMS RELATED TO ASBT-MEDIATED BILE ACID TRANSPORT AND EXCRETION. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, I WILL UTILIZE LDLR -/- MICE, WHICH IS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR MECHANISTICALLY INVESTIGATING ATHEROSCLEROSIS BECAUSE THIS GENETICALLY MODIFIED MODEL HAS CHOLESTEROL PROFILES THAT CLOSELY MIRROR THOSE SEEN IN HUMANS AND IS A MODEL SENSITIVE TO DIETARY MANIPULATION.

MY PROPOSAL SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PERINATAL EDC EXPOSURE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTROGEN-SENSITIVE NEURAL MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE (DA) CIRCUITS INVOLVED IN ATTENTIONAL AND AFFECTIVE REWARD-PROCESSING BEHAVIORS. HERE, I WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PERINATAL EDC EXPOSURE WILL LEAD TO DEFICITS IN DAERGIC BEHAVIORS VIA DISRUPTION OF ESTROGENIC SIGNALING MECHANISMS THAT REGULATE CELLULAR, MOLECULAR AND EPIGENETIC PROCESSES IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN DA SYSTEM.

TO DO THIS, I WILL UTILIZE A WELL-ESTABLISHED EDC MODEL OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS USING AROCLOR 1221 (A1221), A WEAKLY ESTROGENIC MIXTURE. GESTATIONAL EXPOSURE TO A1221 PERTURBS NEUROBIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, AND HAS LATENT EFFECTS ON NEUROENDOCRINE FUNCTIONS, GENE EXPRESSION IN THE BRAIN, AND BEHAVIOR, IN A SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER.

HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE OF EPIPHENOTYPES REMAIN PERPLEXING DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE EPIGENETIC REMODELING THAT HAPPENS IN THE GERMLINE DURING GERM CELL DEVELOPMENT AND AFTER FERTILIZATION.

TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WE PROPOSE TO EXAMINE THE TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF POLYBROMINATED BIPHENYLS (PBBS).

THIS MOUSE EXPOSURE RESULTS IN SIMILAR MATERNAL ADIPOSE PBB LEVELS AS DIRECTLY EXPOSED MICHIGAN RESIDENTS, AND LEADS TO EARLY PUBERTY IN FEMALE F1 MOUSE OFFSPRING, AS OBSERVED IN DAUGHTERS OF DIRECTLY EXPOSED MOTHERS FROM THE MICHIGAN PBB REGISTRY.

INORGANIC ARSENIC (AS) IS A KNOWN NEUROTOXICANT AT HIGHER EXPOSURE LEVELS. CHRONIC LEVELS OF PESTICIDES ARE ALSO NEUROTOXIC, AFFECTING CHILD COGNITION WHEN EXPOSURE OCCURS IN THE PRENATAL PERIOD. BUT THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF LOWER LEVELS OF AS AND CHRONIC COMMON-USE PESTICIDE (CHLORPYRIFOS AND PYRETHROIDS) EXPOSURE IN URBAN HISPANIC/LATINO YOUTH IS UNCLEAR. IT IS ALSO NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD HOW CHILDHOOD EXPOSURES AFFECT EXECUTIVE FUNCTION (EF) DURING ADOLESCENCE, A CRITICAL WINDOW OF SUSCEPTIBILITY UNDERPINNED BY THE MATURATION OF BRAIN AREAS LIKE THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX.

AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION IS A COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE ARISING FROM NUMEROUS DIFFERENT SOURCES AND VARIES OVER TIME; HOWEVER, MANY AIR POLLUTION HEALTH EFFECTS STUDIES FAIL TO CONSIDER MORE THAN A SINGLE POLLUTANT AT A TIME AND RELY ON AN EXPOSURE THAT HAS BEEN AVERAGED OVER TIME. RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN STATISTICAL METHODOLOGIES FOR MULTI- COLLINEAR EXPOSURES HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASED NUMBER OF STUDIES ON HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS OF MULTIPOLLUTANT MIXTURES, BUT THESE METHODOLOGIES STILL OFTEN RESULT IN HARD-TO-INTERPRET EFFECT ESTIMATES AND DO NOT EXTEND TO REPEATED MEASURES OF EXPOSURE. THUS, THERE IS A NEED TO FURTHER IMPROVE MIXTURES METHODOLOGIES TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE TIME-VARYING EXPOSURES AND HAVE INTERPRETABLE EXPOSURE EFFECT ESTIMATES.  THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO IMPROVE METHODOLOGIES FOR THE STUDY OF AIR POLLUTION MIXTURES BY USING A TWO-STAGE TIME SERIES CLUSTERING APPROACH. INITIAL WORK FOCUSES ON SUPPLEMENTING CURRENT LITERATURE BY EXTENDING CLUSTERING METHODOLOGIES TO THE INTERPRETABLE ANALYSIS OF TIME SERIES DATA. THIS DEVELOPMENTAL WORK WILL PROVIDE A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR LATER APPLICATION TO IDENTIFY AND TRANSLATE MULTIPOLLUTANT DIURNAL EXPOSURE PROFILES. IN AIM 1, I WILL IDENTIFY THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF ENDING CLUSTERS BY EXTENDING CURRENT METHODS ON STATIC DATA AND EVALUATING THEIR PERFORMANCE ON TIME SERIES DATA. IDENTIFICATION OF OPTIMAL CLUSTER NUMBER IS NONTRIVIAL WITHOUT EXTERNAL INFORMATION (E.G., A KEY) AND CURRENT METHODS FAIL TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF POSITIVE (OR NEGATIVE) PERFORMANCE FOR TIME SERIES DATA.

PFHXA USE IS NOT REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES. PFHXA IS FOUND UBIQUITOUSLY IN THE ENVIRONMENT SIGNIFICANTLY CONTAMINATING SOIL AND WATER RESULTING IN HUMANS BEING EXPOSED THROUGH INGESTION. EPIDEMIOLOGY LITERATURE HAS REPORTED PFHXA IN MATERNAL SERUM AND BREASTMILK, AND PFHXA CROSSES THE PLACENTA. TOGETHER, THESE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT FETUSES ARE EXPOSED THROUGH THE PLACENTA AND INFANTS THROUGH BREAST FEEDING. IN HUMANS, PFHXA ACCUMULATES HIGHER IN THE CEREBELLUM THAN IN MOST OTHER BRAIN REGIONS. THE CEREBELLUM IS CRITICAL TO BOTH MOTOR AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS, IS THE HOME OF 50% OF THE NEURONS, HAS A UNIQUE CYTOARCHITECTURE, AND DEVELOPS LATER THAN OTHER REGIONS MAKING IT AN IMPORTANT REGION TO STUDY IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICANT EXPOSURES. WHILE THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF PFHXA ARE STILL LARGELY UNSTUDIED, IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT LEGACY PFAS ALTER IMMUNE FUNCTION, INCLUDING SUPPRESSING PERIPHERAL IMMUNE RESPONSES. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF PFHXA ON THE IMMUNE CELLS OF THE BRAIN, MICROGLIA, HAVE NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. MICROGLIA HAVE THE SAME MESODERMAL ORIGINS AS PERIPHERAL IMMUNE CELLS, SUGGESTING THAT DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURES MAY TARGET MICROGLIAL FUNCTION. INTERESTINGLY, MICROGLIA IN THE CEREBELLUM MAY BE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO NEUROTOXICANTS COMPARED TO MICROGLIA IN OTHER BRAIN REGIONS AS THEY HAVE A UNIQUE TRANSCRIPTOMIC PROFILE. IN ADDITION TO IMMUNE FUNCTION, MICROGLIA PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BY AIDING IN ANGIOGENESIS, PROVIDING FACTORS FOR MYELIN DEVELOPMENT, AND PRUNING SYNAPSES THEREBY REMODELING NEURAL CIRCUITS. THUS DEVELOPMENTAL PFHXA EXPOSURE COULD AFFECT THEIR IMMUNE AND NEUROANATOMICAL FUNCTIONS. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF MICROGLIA IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND EVIDENCE THAT PFHXA ENTERS THE BRAIN, PFHXA HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THE MAMMALIAN NERVOUS SYSTEM. BASED ON EVIDENCE FROM EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDIES ON PFHXA AS WELL AS LONG-CHAIN PFAS, I HYPOTHESIZE THAT GESTATIONAL AND LACTATIONAL EXPOSURE TO PFHXA IN A MOUSE MODEL DISRUPTS CEREBELLAR DEVELOPMENT, AFFECTING NEURONAL AND GLIAL PHENOTYPES, AS WELL AS MOTOR ACTIVITY. MICROGLIA MAY BE UNIQUELY AFFECTED BY THIS EXPOSURE, BECOMING IMMUNOSUPPRESSED. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, I WILL PURSUE TWO AIMS USING A MOUSE MODEL REPRESENTING HUMAN EXPOSURE TO PFHXA DURING GESTATION AND LACTATION. THE FIRST AIM WILL INVESTIGATE HOW GESTATIONAL AND LACTATIONAL EXPOSURE TO PFHXA AFFECTS NEURON AND GLIA PHENOTYPES USING RNA SEQUENCING AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC). THIS AIM WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE HOW THIS EXPOSURE AFFECTS ANIMAL BEHAVIORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO THE CEREBELLUM. THE SECOND WILL DETERMINE IF MICROGLIA ARE ALTERED AT THE GENETIC, PROTEIN, AND DYNAMIC LEVEL BY USING RNA SEQUENCING, IHC, AND TWO-PHOTON MICROSCOPY.

INORGANIC ARSENIC (AS) NATURALLY OCCURS IN SOIL AND GROUNDWATER GLOBALLY. WHILE ARSENIC IN DRINKING WATER (WAS) IS REGULATED IN US COMMUNITY WATER SUPPLIES, THE MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LEVEL WAS RECENTLY REDUCED AND ENFORCED BEGINNING IN THE EARLY 2000S. RURAL POPULATIONS, HOWEVER, RELY ON PRIVATE WELLS WHICH ARE NOT REGULATED FOR CONTAMINANTS AND MAY CONTAIN HIGHER LEVELS OF WAS FOUND IN GROUNDWATER. EXPOSURE TO AS HAS BEEN LINKED TO SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AND ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION, AS WELL AS KIDNEY DAMAGE. A LIMITED BUT GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT LOW-TO-MODERATE LEVELS OF WAS PRESENT IN THE US INCREASES THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) OUTCOMES, INCLUDING STROKE AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.

THE STRONG HEART STUDY (SHS), A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF CVD AMONG AI COMMUNITIES IN NORTH DAKOTA, SOUTH DAKOTA, ARIZONA AND OKLAHOMA, REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT POPULATION TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT AND IMPACT OF U EXPOSURE ON HEALTH OUTCOMES.

IN PREGNANT ANIMALS, INHALATION OF PARTICLES ALTERS THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE UTEROPLACENTAL VASCULATURE, LEADING TO IMPAIRED PLACENTAL AND FETAL GROWTH. PARTICULATE MATTER (PM) CAN TARGET THE UTEROPLACENTAL VASCULATURE IN MULTIPLE WAYS. ONE WAY BY WHICH PARTICLES CAN DISRUPT THE UTEROPLACENTAL VASCULATURE IS BY IMPAIRING VASODILATION. DURING PREGNANCY, UTERINE VESSELS MUST BE SENSITIVE TO VASODILATION MEDIATORS TO MEET THE DYNAMIC NEEDS OF THE PLACENTA AND FETUS. CENTRAL TO THIS VASOREACTIVITY IS THE ENDOTHELIAL CELL THAT TRANSLATES SIGNALS FROM THE BLOOD TO THE VASCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS, LEADING TO VESSEL DILATION OR CONSTRICTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE PLACENTA IS A CRITICAL ORGAN FOR THE DIFFUSION OF OXYGEN AND TRANSPORT OF NUTRIENTS TO THE DEVELOPING FETUS. PM CAN IMPAIR DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLACENTAL VASCULATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR MATERNAL-FETAL EXCHANGE AND DECREASE THE RATIO OF PLACENTAL-TO-FETAL TISSUE, KNOWN AS PLACENTAL EFFICIENCY. OUR LABORATORY RECENTLY SHOWED THAT PLASTIC PARTICLES CAN TRANSLOCATE THROUGH THE PLACENTA TO THE FETUS AFTER PULMONARY EXPOSURE, SUGGESTING THAT THE PARTICLES DIRECTLY INTERACT WITH THE UTEROPLACENTAL VASCULATURE.

INADEQUATE SLEEP HAS BEEN LINKED TO MANY PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES LIKE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, DIABETES, AND OBESITY, AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES SUCH AS ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. A NATION-WIDE ANALYSIS SHOWED AN UNEVEN GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF INSUFFICIENT SLEEP ACROSS THE US; THIS GEOGRAPHIC VARIABILITY MAY BE EXPLAINED BY A CONFLUENCE OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES THAT SHAPE ONE\u2019S SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS EXPOSURES THAT ARE EXPERIENCED DURING WAKE CAN IMPACT SLEEP HEALTH. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST DUE TO THEIR MODIFIABILITY ARE BUILT ENVIRONMENT FACTORS, SUCH AS LIGHT AT NIGHT, NEIGHBORHOOD GREENSPACE, AND WALKABILITY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO AFFECT SLEEP.

WE HAVE FOUND 14-3-3 PROTEINS, IN PARTICULAR THE 14-3-3 ISOFORM, ARE PROTECTIVE AGAINST ASYN WHILE INHIBITION OF THESE PROTEINS LEADS TO INCREASED TOXICITY. FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND THAT HUMAN CORTICAL LYSATES OF PD AND DLB PATIENTS SHOWED INCREASED 14-3-3 PHOSPHORYLATION AT S232 COMPARED TO HEALTHY, AGE-MATCHED CONTROLS. TESTING THE IMPACT OF 14-3-3 PHOSPHORYLATION, WE FOUND THAT THE NON-PHOSPHORYLATABLE S232A MUTANT IS PROTECTIVE IN PD MODELS, WHILE THE PHOSPHOMIMETIC S232D MUTANT SHOWED NO PROTECTION OR ACCELERATED TOXICITY.

HOWEVER, THE EVENTS WHICH LEAD TO ABERRANT PS232 LEVELS ARE UNCLEAR. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS THAT INDUCE PS232 AND PROMOTE NEURODEGENERATION IN TWO SYNUCLEINOPATHY-ASSOCIATED EVENTS: EXPOSURE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANT, TRICHLOROETHYLENE (AIM 1) AND NEUROINFLAMMATION (AIM 2). THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF 14-3-3 PHOSPHORYLATION WITHIN SYNUCLEINOPATHIES SO THAT SUBSEQUENT STUDIES CAN BE DEVISED TO TARGET 14-3-3 FOR DEVELOPING POTENTIAL DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPEUTICS.

IN MECHANISTIC STUDIES UNDER AIM 1, I WILL EXAMINE THE TH TARGETS OF PBDES AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF TH DISRUPTION TO ALTERED BEHAVIOR AND NEUROPEPTIDE PHENOTYPES OF PBDE-EXPOSED MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING USING MATERNAL THYROID SUPPLEMENTATION. CHEMOGENETIC ACTIVATION OF OXT RELEASE WITHIN THE PVN WILL BE EMPLOYED IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESCUE PBDE-INDUCED ABNORMAL PHENOTYPES. IN CIRCUIT-LEVEL STUDIES USING RETROGRADE TRACT-TRACING UNDER AIM 2, I WILL EXAMINE PBDE REPROGRAMMING OF THE RECIPROCAL PREFLIMBIC CORTEX TO BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA CIRCUIT, WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR SOCIAL RECOGNITION ABILITY. SINCE THIS CIRCUIT DEPENDS ON OXT RECEPTOR (OXTR) SIGNALING AND IS PURPORTED TO RECEIVE OXTERGIC PROJECTIONS FROM PVN, I WILL DETERMINE IF DEVELOPMENTAL INTRANASAL OXT RESCUES STRUCTURAL CHANGES PRODUCED BY PBDES. THESE STUDIES WILL INVESTIGATE THE NEURODEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS OF MATERNAL TRANSFER OF PBDES ACROSS MULTIPLE LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL AGES TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS AND CRITICAL WINDOWS OF RISK.

PARTICULATE METHANE MONOOXYGENASE (PMMO), A COPPER-DEPENDENT TRANSMEMBRANE ENZYME FROM METHANOTROPHIC BACTERIA, OXIDIZES METHANE TO METHANOL. ITS ABILITY TO PERFORM THIS DIFFICULT CHEMICAL REACTION AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE OFFERS A WINDOW INTO DEVELOPING PROCESSES FOR CONVERSION OF BIOLOGICAL NATURAL GAS TO LIQUID (BIO-GTL) FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION. ISOLATION OF PMMO FROM THE MEMBRANES AND DETERGENT SOLUBILIZATION HAVE HINDERED PAST STUDIES, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY AND DISTORTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE. THE FAILURE OF DETERGENT MICELLES TO RECAPITULATE THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE MEMBRANE MAY PERTURB FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT METAL CENTERS, PROTEIN-LIPID INTERACTIONS, AND PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS.

THIS FINDING MOTIVATED ME TO INVESTIGATE WHY PAB1 IS IMPORTANT FOR CELL GROWTH DURING STRESS. PAB1 ACTS AS A TRANSLATIONAL REPRESSOR BY BINDING TRANSCRIPTS WITH A-RICH 5\u2019 UNTRANSLATED REGIONS (5\u2019UTRS), INCLUDING ITS OWN TRANSCRIPT. INTERESTINGLY, THE TRANSCRIPTS OF MOLECULAR CHAPERONES PRODUCED DURING STRESS HAVE A-RICH 5\u2019UTRS, AND THESE MOLECULAR CHAPERONES GO ON TO RE-SOLUBILIZE PAB1. MY PRELIMINARY WORK SHOWS THAT SOLUBLE PAB1 CAN REPRESS TRANSLATION OF ENDOGENOUS TRANSCRIPTS WITH A-RICH 5\u2019UTRS, WHILE PAB1 CONDENSATION INHIBITS THIS EFFECT. THIS SUGGESTS AN AUTOREGULATORY MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH HEAT-TRIGGERED CONDENSATION OF PAB1 FACILITATES HIGH LEVEL TRANSLATION OF STRESS- INDUCED CHAPERONES, WHOSE CAPACITY TO RE-SOLUBILIZE PAB1 LEADS TO REPRESSED TRANSLATION AFTER SUFFICIENT CHAPERONES HAVE BEEN PRODUCED.

HOWEVER, THIS CHANGE HAS NOT BEEN ASSESSED AT FINE SPATIO-TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IN NYC, CHALLENGING THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDY OF ITS IMPACT ON STROKE AND MI, INCLUDING VARIATION BY SES AND CHRONIC DISEASE BURDEN (CDB; I.E., PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WITH HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, OBESITY). DURING THE PANDEMIC, SUBSTANTIAL DECREASES IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS FOR STROKE AND MI, WHICH CAN BE TRIGGERED BY TRAP, HAVE BEEN OBSERVED. WHILE THIS DECREASE IS LIKELY DRIVEN IN PART BY REDUCED CARE SEEKING, GIVEN KNOWN ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN TRAP AND STROKE/MI, THE LARGE DECREASES IN TRAP LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DECLINE. HOWEVER, THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN INVESTIGATED IN NYC. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THAT THE VEHICLE FLEET COMPOSITION HAS LIKELY SHIFTED DURING THE PANDEMIC (E.G., PROPORTIONALLY MORE DELIVERY TRUCKS), THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONGESTION, TRAP, AND STROKE/MI DURING THE PANDEMIC IS NOT KNOWN. TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS, THIS PROPOSAL WILL: (1) EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON (A) TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND (B) TRAP IN NYC; AND ASSESS VARIATION IN CONGESTION BY INDICES OF SES AND CDB; (2) ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF ACUTE TRAP-ASSOCIATED STROKE AND MI HOSPITALIZATIONS EXPECTED TO BE PREVENTED BY ALTERED TRAP DURING THE PANDEMIC, COMPARE TO TOTAL OBSERVED CHANGES IN STROKE/MI HOSPITALIZATIONS, AND ASSESS VARIABILITY BY SES AND CDB; AND (3) (EXPLORATORY) INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CONGESTION, TRAP, STROKE, AND MI HOSPITALIZATIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC.  THE MAIN GOAL OF THE TRAINING PLAN IS TO PROVIDE THE APPLICANT WITH THE SKILLS, EXPERTISE, AND EXPERIENCE TO CONDUCT RIGOROUS PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, WITH A FOCUS IN AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH. THE TRAINING PLAN INCLUDES A MIX OF FORMAL DIDACTIC TRAINING, APPLIED RESEARCH EXPERIENCE, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND ORAL PRESENTATION OPPORTUNITIES.

YET, HOW THE AHR MODULATES TFH CELLS IS NOT KNOWN. THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT THE AHR IN CD4+ T CELLS AFFECTS TFH CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND FUNCTION. TFH CELL DIFFERENTIATION INVOLVES CD4+ T CELL ACTIVATION, DIFFERENTIATION, PROLIFERATION, AND SURVIVAL. THE AHR COULD AFFECT THESE PROCESSES SINGLY OR IN COMBINATION TO ALTER TFH CELL DIFFERENTIATION. THUS, IN THE FIRST AIM WILL WE WILL USE LINEAGE-SPECIFIC AHR GENE ABLATION, MULTI-PARAMETER FLOW CYTOMETRY, AND ENZYME LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AHR ACTIVATION ALTERS TFH CELL DIFFERENTIATION BY AFFECTING CD4+ T CELL ACTIVATION, PROLIFERATION, AND/OR APOPTOSIS. ADDITIONALLY, THESE STUDIES WILL DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGES TO TFH CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND FUNCTION ARE SOLELY DUE TO AHR-DRIVEN CHANGES IN CD4+ T CELLS. THE SECOND AIM WILL USE SINGLE CELL RNA-SEQ AND CHIP-SEQ TO EVALUATE AHR REGULATION OF GENES IN CD4+ T CELLS THAT ENCODE FACTORS CRITICAL TO TFH CELL DIFFERENTIATION. GIVEN THAT HUMANS EXPOSED TO AHR-BINDING POLLUTANTS EXHIBIT GREATER INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF INFECTIONS, AS WELL AS REDUCED ANTIBODY RESPONSES TO COMMON VACCINES, THESE FINDINGS WILL FILL KEY GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE AND PROVIDE NECESSARY DATA FOR TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES WITH POPULATIONS EXPOSED TO AHR BINDING CHEMICALS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f8e3456f-8dec-1441-72b9-fa2b342bdb94-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F31ES032301_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140058112, "Award ID": "F31ES032299", "Award Amount": 91323.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-14", "CFDA Number": "93.113", "Description": "NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF TOXIC METAL EXPOSURE IN MODEL RODENTS COLLECTED IN ZONES OF INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE ON THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER - ABSTRACT YUMA COUNTY IS A LARGE AGRICULTURAL HUB OF THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDES OVER 90% OF THE WINTER LEAFY GREENS CONSUMED IN THE U.S. TO MAINTAIN HIGH AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT, MORE THAN 2.6 MILLION KILOGRAMS OF AGRICHEMICALS ARE USED IN YUMA COUNTY EACH YEAR. THESE AGRICHEMICALS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE SOURCE OF TOXIC CHEMICALS FOR RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY THE MIGRANT AND SEASONAL FARMWORKERS AND THOSE LIVING NEAR AGRICULTURAL LANDS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH FOCUSED ON ORGANIC BASED PESTICIDES AND LEAD EXPOSURE SOURCES, BUT INORGANIC METALS-BASED PESTICIDES HAVE NOT BEEN EXAMINED IN THIS AREA. I PERFORMED QUANTITATIVE METAL(LOID) ANALYSIS OF HUMAN (N = 323) AND RODENT (PEROMYSCUS EREMICUS, N = 300) HAIR SAMPLES AND FOUND CONCENTRATIONS OF NEUROTOXIC METALS (ESPECIALLY CU AND MN) AT LEVELS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. FOLLOWING THESE FINDINGS, PRELIMINARY TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED DISRUPTED GENETIC PATHWAYS, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH LIPID METABOLISM AND MUSCLE CONTRACTION, IN THE BRAINS OF RODENTS THAT I CAPTURED FROM AGRICULTURAL SITES, COMPARED TO NON-AGRICULTURAL SITES, FROM YUMA COUNTY. CU AND MN ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING ELEMENTS AND ARE ESSENTIAL MICRONUTRIENTS IN ENZYMATIC REACTIONS, BUT BOTH ARE TOXIC AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS. CU CAUSES NON-SPECIFIC OXIDATIVE DAMAGE IN TISSUES, WHILE MN ACCUMULATES IN THE BASAL GANGLIA AND DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS AND IS LINKED WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES IN CHILDREN AND MOTOR DYSFUNCTION IN ADULTS. FARMWORKERS AND COMMUNITIES NEAR AGRICULTURAL AREAS WITH HIGH AGRICHEMICAL APPLICATION ARE AN UNDERSTUDIED POPULATION REGARDING EXCESSIVE CU AND MN EXPOSURE. THIS PROPOSAL EXPANDS UPON MY PRELIMINARY WORK THAT IDENTIFIED ELEVATED CONCENTRATIONS OF CU AND MN IN HUMAN AND RODENT HAIR COLLECTED IN YUMA COUNTY BY USING THE P. EREMICUS RODENT MODEL TO INVESTIGATE TRANSCRIPTOMIC AND LIPIDOMIC RESPONSES TO EXPOSURE. ADDITIONALLY, I AM DEVELOPING A SIMILAR APPROACH IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COCOPAH TRIBE IN YUMA COUNTY TO ASSESS THE RISK OF CONTAMINANT EXPOSURE IN THEIR PEOPLE. UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM, I AIM TO: AIM 1) ASSESS EFFECTS OF MIXED METALS EXPOSURE ON BRAIN GENE EXPRESSION IN RODENTS COLLECTED FROM AGRICULTURAL VS. NON-AGRICULTURAL REGIONS OF YUMA COUNTY, USING BOTH NON-TARGETED NANOSTRING AND TARGETED QRT-PCR APPROACHES; AIM 2) ASSESS EFFECTS OF MIXED METALS EXPOSURE ON BRAIN METABOLIC PROFILES IN RODENTS FROM THESE TWO EXPOSURE REGIONS, USING LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-ION MOBILITY SPECTROMETRY-MASS SPECTROMETRY; AND AIM 3) GATHER P. EREMICUS SAMPLES ON COCOPAH TRIBAL LANDS TO CONDUCT PRELIMINARY EXPOSURE RISK ASSESSMENT.

EXPOSURE TO BPA HAS BEEN LINKED TO ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN HUMANS SUCH AS CANCER, HEART DISEASE, AUTISM, AND OBESITY. PARENTAL EXPOSURE ALSO LEADS TO ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN THEIR UNEXPOSED OFFSPRING , THOUGH THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. EXPOSING PREGNANT MICE FROM E7.5-E13.5, WHEN THE FETAL GERMLINE IS REPROGRAMMED, INDUCES AN OBESITY EPIPHENOTYPE THAT CAN BE INHERITED STABLY FOR 6 GENERATIONS. BPA IS AN ENDOCRINE DIRSPUTOR THAT IS KNOWN TO INTERACT WITH SEVERAL NUCLEAR HORMONE RECEPTORS, THEREFORE, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT IN UTERO BPA EXPOSURE ALTERED THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS IN THE GERMLINE. ALSO, THE ALTERED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR OCCUPANCY COULD LEAD TO OTHER CHANGES TO THE TRANSCRIPTOME, HISTONE MODIFICATION, DNA METHYLATION, OR OTHER EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS. DATA IN MALE GERMLINE SUPPORT THIS HYPOTHESIS. OUR LAB HAS CHARACTERIZED 12 CANDIDATE SITES THAT GAIN ACCESSIBILITY AND ARE DEPLETED OF DNA METHYLATION. THESE SITES CORRELATE WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF THE OBESITY PHENOTYPE, CORRESPOND TO OTHER EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS IN THE MALE GERMLINE, AND ARE NEAR GENES OBESITY-RELATED GENES. DESPITE WHAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE MALE GERMLINE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE MECHANISM OF TRANSMISSION IN THE FEMALE GERMLINE IS UNIQUE. WHEN WE OBSERVE THE TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE MALE AND FEMALE GERMLINE INDENPENDENTLY, WE OBSERVE THAT THE OBESITY EPIPHENOTYPE IS MUCH MORE ROBOST WHEN IT TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE FEMALE GERMLINE. IN PRELIMINARY ATAC-SEQ DATA IN GV OOCYTES FROM BPA F2 MICE AND CONTROL, WE DEFINE MANY ALTERATIONS TO ACCESSIBILITY, 1,245 SITES THAT GAINED AND 9 SITES LOST IN THE BPA F2. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHICH EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE FEMALE GERMLINE, WE PROPOSED THE FOLLOWING. IN AIM 1, TO CHARACTERIZE HOW CHANGES TO ACCESSIBILITY, DNA METHYLATION, AND THE TRANSCRIPTOME CORRESPOND TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THE OBESITY PHENOTYPE THROUGH THE FEMALE GERMLINE, WE WILL CREATE ATAC-SEQ, BS-SEQ, AND RNA-SEQ LIBRARIES IN THE GV AND MII OOCYTES OF CONTROL MICE AND THE PROGENY OF BPA-EXPOSED MICE. THIS WILL ALLOW USE TO DETERMINE WHICH ALTERATIONS MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE. IN AIM 2, WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE ACCESSIBILITY, TRANSCRIPTOME, AND DISTRIBUTION OF HISTONE MODIFICATION IN THE EMBRYOS FROM BPA F2 FEMALE OUTCROSSES AND CONTROL INTERCROSSES. WITH THIS, WE WILL CHARACTERIZE WHICH ALTERATIONS TO ACCESSIBILITY ALREADY DEFINED IN THE BPA F2 OOCYTE PERSIST IN THE EMBRYO AND IF ANY OF THE EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS TRANSMITTED FROM THE OOCYTE CORRESPOND TO CHANGES IN TRANSCRIPTOME OR CHROMATIN LANDSCAPE IN THE PREIMPLANTATION EMBRYO. THE COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL ALLOW US TO CHARACTERIZE HOW BPA EXPOSURE CAN STABLY ALTER EPIGENETIC INFORMATION IN THE OOCYTE, AND IF THIS INFORMATION CAN BE TRANSMITTED TO THE EMBRYO AND ELLICT

THE CELL BIOLOGY OF EXTREME HEAT SHOCK >40\u00b0C IS WELL-CHARACTERIZED, BUT FAR LESS IS UNDERSTOOD ABOUT SUBLETHAL, FEVER-RANGE TEMPERATURES <40\u00b0C. HOWEVER, WE DO KNOW THAT CERTAIN IMMUNE CELLS UPREGULATE HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN RESPONSE TO FEVER.

CMDS ARE MORE PREVALENT IN HISPANICS/LATINOS, AND THIS POPULATION SUFFERS WORSE COMPLICATIONS AND OUTCOMES THAN NON-HISPANIC WHITES. WHILE LIFESTYLE FACTORS AND GENETIC PREDISPOSITION PLAY A ROLE IN CMD DEVELOPMENT, THE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES HAS NOT BEEN WELL-ESTABLISHED. STARR COUNTY, TEXAS, IS A PREDOMINANTLY MEXICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY WITH STAGGERING RAGES OF CMDS, SPECIFICALLY DIABETES MELLITUS. INTERESTINGLY, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT METAL AND METALLOID EXPOSURES MAY INCREASE THE RISK FOR CMDS AND CMD-RELATED TRAITS IN THIS POPULATION. THEREFORE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT EXPOSURE TO METALS/METALLOIDS CONTRIBUTES TO THE OBSERVED HEIGHTENED RISK OF CMDS IN THIS POPULATION. TO ADDRESS THIS, WE WILL LEVERAGE DATA FROM A WELL-ESTABLISHED PROSPECTIVE COHORT FROM STARR COUNTY, TEXAS, A COMMUNITY OF >90% HISPANIC/LATINO ORIGIN. UTILIZING ALREADY MEASURED URINARY METAL/METALLOID CONCENTRATIONS, WE WILL EVALUATE LONGITUDINAL CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC TRAJECTORIES OF BLOOD PRESSURE, HEMOGLOBIN A1C, FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE, AND HOMOSTATIC MEASURES OF ASSESSMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL METAL EXPOSURES AND METAL MIXTURES IN 600 INDIVIDUALS OVER 3 YEARS. GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETAL BURDEN OF CMDS, IT IS VITAL TO IDENTIFY MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS IN ORDER TO EMPOWER ACTION FOR DISEASE PREVENTION, DETECTION, AND TREATMENT. THROUGH THE PROJECT PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION, VALUABLE INSIGHT WILL BE GAINED INTO THE ROLE OF METAL/METALLOID EXPOSURES AND CMD RISK IN A HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATION IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.

THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES OF ORGANOPHOSPHATE FLAME RETARDANTS (OPES) HAVE DRASTICALLY INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE PHASE-OUT OF THE NEUROTOXIC POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHER (PBDE) FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS. THE METABOLITES OF OPES ARE DETECTABLE IN BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES OF 77-90% OF U.S. ADULTS, AND EXPOSURE OCCURS MAINLY THROUGH ACCIDENTAL DUST INGESTION. THERE IS A STARTLING LACK OF RESEARCH INTO THE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF EXPOSURE TO THESE REPLACEMENT FLAME RETARDANTS, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN LINKED TO NEUROBEHAVIORAL TOXICITY AND THYROID HORMONE DISRUPTION IN ANIMALS. TIGHT THYROID HORMONE REGULATION DURING GESTATION AND EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ESSENTIAL FOR NORMAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, AND OTHERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT THYROID DISRUPTION MAY BE ONE MECHANISM BY WHICH OPES CAUSE NEUROTOXICITY. THERE IS VERY LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF OPE EXPOSURE IN HUMANS, AND NONE IN CHILDREN OR LONGITUDINAL COHORTS. WE INTEND TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP WITH THE PROPOSED WORK. OUR OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT EXPOSURE TO OPES DURING GESTATION AND EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THYROID HORMONE DISRUPTION, DECREASED CHILD INTELLIGENCE, AND INCREASED ADHD BEHAVIORS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL MEASURE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO OPES AT SEVERAL TIME POINTS AND THYROID FUNCTION IN CHILDREN. IN AIM 2, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE LINK BETWEEN OPE EXPOSURE AND CHILD INTELLIGENCE AND ADHD SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING A MEDIATION ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THYROID FUNCTION LIES ON THIS CAUSAL PATHWAY. FINALLY, AIM 3 WILL INVOLVE A MIXTURES ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE TO A COMBINATION OF OPES, PBDES, AND LEAD AND THE OUTCOME OF CHILD INTELLIGENCE.

FOR THE CHEMICAL MIXTURES ANALYSIS, SERUM PBDE CONCENTRATIONS AND BLOOD LEAD LEVELS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MEASURED FROM MATERNAL AND CHILD SAMPLES, AND WE WILL EMPLOY FIVE DIFFERENT ANALYTICAL METHODS TO EXPLORE SYNERGISTIC INTERACTIONS AND JOINT EFFECTS ON THE OUTCOME OF CHILD INTELLIGENCE. THIS PROJECT WILL BE THE AMONG THE FIRST TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRE- AND POST-NATAL REPLACEMENT FLAME RETARDANT EXPOSURE, TH LEVELS, AND NEUROBEHAVIOR IN AN ESTABLISHED BIRTH COHORT OF CHILDREN.

TWO REPRESENTATIVE FEATURES OF THE CELLULAR STRESS RESPONSE, WHICH IS UNIVERSALLY CONSERVED ACROSS EUKARYA AND OCCURS IN RESPONSE TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT NOXIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, ARE 1) THE UPREGULATION OF THE CYTOPROTECTIVE HEAT SHOCK PROTEINS AND 2) BIOMOLECULAR CONDENSATION OF RNA AND PROTEIN INTO ASSEMBLIES. MOST TRANSLATION IS SHUT DOWN, WHILE PROTEINS INVOLVED IN THE STRESS RESPONSE ARE EFFICIENTLY PRODUCED. HOW TRANSLATION IS REPROGRAMMED TO FAVOR HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN PRODUCTION POST-TRANSCRIPTIONALLY IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD, BUT BIOMOLECULAR CONDENSATION HAS BEEN LINKED TO TRANSLATIONAL CONTROL. BASIC QUESTIONS ARE INCOMPLETELY ANSWERED: 1) WHICH MRNAS CONDENSE IN RESPONSE TO STRESS? 2) WHAT CELLULAR MECHANISMS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MRNA CONDENSATION? AND 3) WHAT IS THE FUNCTIONAL RELEVANCE OF MRNA CONDENSATION TO TRANSLATIONAL CONTROL?  HEREIN, WE PRESENT UNPUBLISHED WORK MEASURING MRNA SOLUBILITY OF >5,000 GENES DURING TEMPERATURE STRESS IN S. CEREVISIAE BY BIOCHEMICAL SEDIMENTATION FOLLOWED BY RNA-SEQUENCING. THESE DATA INFORM OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT BLOCKING TRANSLATION INITIATION TRIGGERS CONDENSATION OF AN MRNA THROUGH SPECIFIC BINDING BY UNKNOWN PROTEIN FACTOR(S).

TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES, WE AIM TO CONFIRM THAT BLOCKING TRANSLATION INITIATION TRIGGERS MRNA CONDENSATION BOTH ON A TRANSCRIPTOME-WIDE AND INDIVIDUAL MESSAGE LEVEL, TO DETERMINE PROTEIN FACTORS REQUIRED FOR MRNA CONDENSATION, AND TO TEST THE ROLE OF MRNA CONDENSATION IN TRANSLATIONAL REPROGRAMMING DURING STRESS. PRELIMINARY DATA MEASURING THE SOLUBILITY OF BOTH NATIVE AND REPORTER MRNAS SUPPORT THAT BLOCKING TRANSLATION INITIATION TRIGGERS CONDENSATION. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AND WILL INTERROGATE A SET OF THE TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTORS AS CANDIDATES PUTATIVELY REQUIRED FOR MRNA CONDENSATION. WE WILL TEST WHETHER THE CANDIDATES ARE REQUIRED FOR MRNA CONDENSATION AND MEASURE THE TRANSLATIONAL EFFECT OF PERTURBING MRNA CONDENSATION DURING STRESS.

THE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO TOXIC METALS IS UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, WITH A MUCH HIGHER BURDEN OF EXPOSURE TO MANY INDUSTRIAL POLLUTANTS IN DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS AMONG INDIVIDUALS OF LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION AND MINORITY RACE. ALTHOUGH LINKS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS (SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION, OCCUPATION, ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, ETC.) AND BIOMARKERS OF ELEVATED TOXIC METALS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF LARGE-SCALE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES ON SERUM METAL LEVELS. GIVEN RAPID CHANGES IN MANY AMERICAN URBAN AREAS DUE TO INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AND DEINDUSTRIALIZATION, UNDERSTANDING THE POPULATION-LEVEL RISKS POSED BY URBAN INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AND NEIGHBORHOOD SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IS IMPERATIVE TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF TOXIC METALS ON POPULATION HEALTH. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO (1) CHARACTERIZE THE EFFECTS OF URBAN SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES ON INDIVIDUAL AND JOINT SERUM LEAD (PB), MERCURY (HG), CHROMIUM (CR), AND MANGANESE (MN), AND (2) ASSESS THE INDIVIDUAL AND SIMULTANEOUS EFFECTS OF PB, HG, CR, AND MN ON EPIGENETIC AGING. LONGITUDINAL DATA FROM 779 PARTICIPANTS IN THE 2008-2013 DETROIT NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH STUDY (DNHS) AND DATA ON LOCATION-SPECIFIC URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS FROM THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY, MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, AND MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF BLOCK GROUP BUILDING QUALITY, VACANT HOUSING, BROWNFIELD POLLUTION, AND COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC DENSITY ON LONGITUDINAL MEASURES OF SERUM PB, HG, CR, AND MN.

EXPOSURE TO ARSENIC- CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER IMPACTS APPROXIMATELY 140 MILLION INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE GLOBE INCLUDING 13 MILLION IN THE U.S AND 56 MILLION IN BANGLADESH. THIS EXPOSURE INCREASES THE RISK OF MULTIPLE CANCERS AS WELL AS CARDIOVASCULAR AND NEUROLOGIC DISEASES, PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS, AND DIABETES. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE INTER- INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN AME WITH LOWER AME ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER RISK OF ARSENIC TOXICITY. A GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDY (GWAS) OF AME IN A BANGLADESHI POPULATION CONDUCTED BY OUR GROUP IDENTIFIED MULTIPLE GENETIC VARIANTS IN THE 10Q24.32 REGION INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AME (MEASURED AS RELATIVE CONCENTRATIONS OF ARSENIC METABOLITES IN URINE). THESE VARIANTS RESIDE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AS3MT, A GENE CODING FOR ARSENITE METHYLTRANSFERASE, A KEY ENZYME INVOLVED IN ARSENIC METABOLISM. HOWEVER, NEITHER THE CAUSAL VARIANTS IN THIS REGION NOR THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THEIR EFFECTS ARE KNOWN. THESE GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE ARE LIKELY DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, INCOMPLETE GENETIC DATA, AND SINGLE-POPULATION FOCUS OF MANY PREVIOUS STUDIES, AS WELL AS A LACK OF INTEGRATION OF DATA SOURCES ON THE POTENTIAL FUNCTIONAL EFFECTS OF ASSOCIATED VARIANTS. TO ADDRESS THE LIMITATIONS OF PRIOR STUDIES, WE WILL ANALYZE DENSE GENOTYPING DATA FROM TARGETED SEQUENCING OF THE 10Q24.32 REGION FOR ~4100 INDIVIDUALS FROM 3 ARSENIC-EXPOSED COHORTS: THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF ARSENIC LONGITUDINAL STUDY, THE STRONG HEART STUDY, AND THE NEW HAMPSHIRE SKIN CANCER STUDY OF SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA. FIRST, WE WILL USE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CAUSAL VARIANTS UNDERLYING OBSERVED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN AME AND INHERITED VARIATION IN THE 10Q24.32 REGION.

OVERALL, THE IDENTIFIED CLINICAL CAUSES OF MATERNAL DEATH ARE: CARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS (14%), HEMORRHAGE (13%), INFECTION (11%) EMBOLISM (10%), CARDIOMYOPATHY (95), MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS (9%) AND PREECLAMPSIA/ECLAMPSIA (8%) BUT THESE CONDITIONS VARY BY RACE/ETHNICITY. FOR BLACK, NON-HISPANIC WOMEN, THE TWO LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH WERE CARDIOMYOPATHY AND CARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS, AND MENTAL CONDITIONS WAS THE LEADING CAUSE AMONG WHITE, NON-HISPANIC WOMEN.1 OBESITY, HYPERTENSION, SMOKING, OPIOID USE AND SLEEP DISORDERS ARE ALSO CONDITIONS AND BEHAVIORS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MATERNAL MORBIDITY SUCH AS HEMORRHAGE, PREECLAMPSIA AND CARDIOMYOPATHY. THESE COULD POTENTIALLY BE ADDRESSED IN PRIMARY CARE BEFORE AND BETWEEN PREGNANCIES.2-6 THE NATIONAL HEART, LUNG BLOOD INSTITUTE (NHLBI) IS PARTICIPATING IN A TRANS-NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) EFFORT TO IMPROVE WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH, PARTICULARLY MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. A PLAN \u2013 ADVANCING SCIENCE FOR THE HEALTH OF WOMEN, THE TRANS-NIH STRATEGIC PLAN FOR WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH RESEARCH \u2013 WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE PERIOD 2019 \u2013 2023. THIS PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK THAT RECOGNIZES THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT AFFECT WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE, INCLUDING PREGNANCY. LIFE COURSE THEORY POSITS THAT HEALTH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS BEFORE CONCEPTION AND CONTINUES ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN. IT SUGGESTS THAT A COMPLEX PLAY OF BIOLOGIC, BEHAVIORAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL PROTECTIVE AND RISK FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND THAT HEALTH STATUS REFLECTS THE CUMULATIVE LIFETIME EXPOSURE TO THESE FACTORS. THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THIS PLAN ARE CONSIDERATION OF THE COMPLEX FACTORS AFFECTING WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH, THE INCLUSION OF DIVERSE POPULATIONS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, AND ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF A DIVERSE GROUP OF SCIENTISTS.7 THE NIH APPROACH TO REDUCING MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WILL AIM TO ENHANCE HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH, INCREASE THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AND OTHER RISK FACTORS (INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS), IMPROVE CARE (ANTEPARTUM, INTRAPARTUM AND POSTPARTUM) AND MANAGEMENT, PROVIDE INSIGHT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPOSURES SUCH AS STRESS, DISCRIMINATION AND CAREGIVING, UNDERSTAND COPING BEHAVIORS IN FAMILIES AFFECTED BY MATERNAL MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY, AND INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS REGARDING PREGNANCY.8 WITHIN NHLBI, MATERNAL AND WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH PRIORITIES SPAN ALL OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE NHLBI STRATEGIC VISION, AND NHLBI HAS SUPPORTED A NUMBER OF MATERNAL HEALTH PROGRAMS LOOKING AT HYPERTENSION, SLEEP DISORDERS, AND OTHER PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING PRE-ECLAMPSIA, ECLAMPSIA, AND GESTATIONAL DIABETES. THE GOAL OF THE NHLBI 3M ADMINISTRATIVE COORDINATING CENTER (3M ACC) IS TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES AND NETWORKS IN AREAS THAT EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THE 3M ACC WILL SUPPORT THE PRELIMINARY WORK NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY AND PREPARE A GROUP OF COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO RESPOND TO FUTURE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. THE 3M ACC WILL DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THIS GROUP OF MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY REGIONAL COALITIONS (3M RCS) AND PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT AND COORDINATION TO NHLBI ON EMERGING SCIENTIFIC NEEDS. SPECIFICALLY, THE 3M ACC WILL SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMMATIC OBJECTIVES: - IDENTIFY RESEARCH GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXISTING AND RELEVANT EXPERTISE AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. - CONDUCT LANDSCAPE ANALYSES AND COMMUNITY-INFORMED NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. - IDENTIFY WITHIN EACH COMMUNITY IMPLEMENTATION OPPORTUNITIES AND BARRIERS TO IMPROVE DELIVERY OF EVIDENCE-BASED CARE TO REDUCE MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. - DEVELOP AND CONDUCT EARLY-STAGE TESTS OF I", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": 81202492.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1a05eb77-da74-5790-7cc1-11f261fd252e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_OT2HL158287_7529"}]
