GC DEVICE - RECENT STUDIES, INCLUDING OURS, HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BREATH MAY ALLOW US TO DIAGNOSE COVID-19 INFECTION AND EVEN MONITOR ITS PROGRESS. AS COMPARED TO IMMUNOLOGICAL AND GENETIC BASED METHODS USING SAMPLE MEDIA LIKE BLOOD, NASOPHARYNGEAL SWAB, AND SALIVA, BREATH ANALYSIS IS NON-INVASIVE, SIMPLE, SAFE, AND INEXPENSIVE; IT ALLOWS A NEARLY INFINITE AMOUNT OF SAMPLE VOLUME AND CAN BE USED AT THE POINT-OF-CARE FOR RAPID DETECTION. FUNDAMENTALLY, BREATH ALSO PROVIDES CRITICAL METABOLOMICS INFORMATION REGARDING HOW HUMAN BODY RESPONDS TO VIRUS INFECTION AND MEDICAL INTERVENTION (SUCH AS DRUG TREATMENT AND MECHANICAL VENTILATION). THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED SCENT PROJECT ARE: (1) TO REFINE AUTOMATED, PORTABLE, HIGH-PERFORMANCE MICRO-GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY (GC) DEVICE AND RELATED DATA ANALYSIS / BIOMARKER IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHMS FOR RAPID (5-6 MINUTES), IN-SITU, AND SENSITIVE (DOWN TO PPT) BREATH ANALYSIS AND (2) TO CONDUCT BREATH ANALYSIS ON UP TO 760 PATIENTS, AND IDENTIFY AND VALIDATE THE COVID-19 BIOMARKERS IN BREATH. THUS, IN COORDINATION WITH THE RADX-RAD DATA COORDINATION CENTER (DCC), WE WILL COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS. (1) REFINE 5 AUTOMATED MICRO-GC DEVICES TO ACHIEVE HIGHER SPEED AND BETTER SEPARATION CAPABILITY. WE WILL CONSTRUCT 5 NEW AUTOMATED AND PORTABLE ONE-DIMENSIONAL MICRO-GC DEVICES THAT REQUIRE ONLY ~6 MINUTES OF ASSAY TIME (IMPROVED FROM CURRENT 20 MINUTES) AT THE PPT LEVEL SENSITIVITY (SUB-AIM 1A). THEN THE DEVICES WILL BE UPGRADED TO 2-DIMENSIONAL MICRO-GC TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE SEPARATION CAPABILITY (SUB-AIM 1B). IN THE MEANTIME, WE WILL OPTIMIZE AND AUTOMATE OUR EXISTING DATA PROCESSING AND BIOMARKER IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHMS AND CODES TO STREAMLINE THE WORKFLOW SO THAT THE GC DEVICE CAN AUTOMATICALLY PROCESS AND ANALYZE THE DATA WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION (SUB-AIM 1C). (2) IDENTIFY BREATH BIOMARKERS THAT DISTINGUISH COVID-19 POSITIVE (SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC) AND NEGATIVE PATIENTS. WE WILL RECRUIT A TRAINING COHORT OF 380 PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING 190 COVID-19 POSITIVE PATIENTS (95 SYMPTOMATIC AND 95 ASYMPTOMATIC) AND 190 COVID-19 NEGATIVE PATIENTS FROM TWO HOSPITALS (MICHIGAN MEDICINE \u2013 ANN ARBOR AND THE HENRY FORD HOSPITAL \u2013 DETROIT). WE WILL CONDUCT BREATH ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING TO IDENTIFY VOC PATTERNS THAT MATCH EACH COVID-19 DIAGNOSTIC STATUS. (3) VALIDATE THE COVID-19 BIOMARKERS USING OUR REFINED MICRO-GC DEVICES. USING THE REFINED 2-D MICRO-GC DEVICES FROM SUB-AIM 1B, WE WILL RECRUIT A NEW VALIDATION COHORT OF 380 PARTICIPANTS (190 COVID-19 POSITIVE PATIENTS AND 190 COVID-19 NEGATIVE PATIENTS) TO VALIDATE THE BIOMARKERS IDENTIFIED IN AIM 2.  WE WILL LEVERAGE EXISTING ENGINEERING, DATA SCIENCE, CLINICAL, REGULATORY, AND COMMERCIALIZATION RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT TO HIT OUR MILESTONES, ENSURING A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF RAPID PATIENT IMPACT.

CORONAVIRUSES (COVS) ARE MEMBRANE-ENVELOPED POSITIVE-SENSE, SINGLE-STRANDED RNA VIRUSES DECORATED WITH MEMBRANE PROTEINS. THE SPIKE (S) GLYCOPROTEIN IS IMPLICATED IN THE VIRAL ATTACHMENT AND FUSION TO HOST CELLS VIA THE HUMAN ANGIOTENSIN- CONVERTING ENZYME 2 (HACE2). THERE ARE DIFFERENT ASSAYS TO TEST FOR COVID-19, INCLUDING NUCLEIC ACID, ANTIGEN, AND SEROLOGICAL TESTS THAT CAN BE USED IN HOSPITALS, POINT-OF-CARE, AND LARGE-SCALE POPULATION TESTING. NUCLEIC ACID TESTING IS THE STANDARD METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2, WHICH CONSISTS OF THE AMPLIFICATION OF VIRAL RNA FROM NASOPHARYNGEAL SWABS (NPS) BY QUANTITATIVE REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (QRT-PCR). FURTHERMORE, GIVEN THE INVASIVE NATURE OF NPS, SALIVA IS BEING CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE FOR DETECTION. METHODS THAT BYPASS RNA EXTRACTION, AS WELL AS ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION SUCH AS LOOP-MEDIATED ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION (LAMP), HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO IMPROVE THE SPEED OF VIRAL RNA DETECTION. HOWEVER, VIRAL PROTEIN EXPRESSION CANNOT BE DETECTED BY QRT-PCR. SEROLOGICAL TESTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE BASED ON HOST ANTIBODIES AGAINST THE VIRUS (IGG/IGM). ALTHOUGH FAST, THESE TESTS SUFFER FROM SIGNIFICANT FALSE NEGATIVE/POSITIVE. BESIDES, THEY DO NOT DETECT A CURRENT INFECTION. THEREFORE, TO RELIEVE THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE CRISIS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAPABLE OF SIMULTANEOUS VIRAL RNA/PROTEIN DETECTION AT THE SINGLE VIRUS LEVEL AND HOST ANTIBODY RESPONSE DETECTION FROM A BODY FLUID IN AN INTEGRATED DEVICE WOULD BE HIGHLY VALUABLE FOR ENHANCED COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS. RECENTLY, OUR GROUP, AS PART OF PHASE 2 OF THE EXTRACELLULAR RNA COMMUNICATION CONSORTIUM (ERCC2), HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED A MICROFLUIDICS TECHNOLOGY CAPABLE OF CAPTURING INDIVIDUAL EXOSOMES FROM BIOFLUIDS AND THEN SIMULTANEOUSLY QUANTIFY BOTH EXOSOMAL SURFACE PROTEINS AND RNA CARGO. GIVEN THE RESEMBLANCE IN SIZE AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN EXOSOMES AND CORONAVIRUSES, OUR TECHNOLOGY CAN BE ADAPTED FOR COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SAFE-TO-USE VERSION OF OUR MICROFLUIDICS SYSTEM FOR DIRECT DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2. THE INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF MULTI-PARAMETRIC DETECTION FOR ENHANCED COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS. THE PLATFORM WILL BE ENGINEERED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY QUANTIFY BOTH VIRAL PROTEIN, VIRAL RNA, AND HOST ANTIBODIES (IGG/IGM) IN THE SAME SAMPLE, ENABLING DIAGNOSIS, DISEASE STATUS, AND PROGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT. MODEL SYSTEMS, INCLUDING HOST IGG/IGM FROM PATIENT SERUM, STANDARD SYNTHETIC VESICLES (SVS), AND HEAT-INACTIVATED SARS-COV-2 VIRAL PARTICLES (SVVS), WILL BE DESIGNED AND SPIKED IN BIOFLUIDS TO VALIDATE AND CALIBRATE THE SYSTEM. TO DEMONSTRATE THE CLINICAL UTILITY, OUR BIOCHIP TECHNOLOGY WILL BE DEPLOYED AND TESTED USING DIFFERENT BIOFLUIDS FROM COVID-19 PATIENTS AT TWO INDEPENDENT LABORATORIES (INSTITUTE OF SYSTEMS BIOLOGY IN SEATTLE AND THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU) WEXNER MEDICAL CENTER IN COLUMBUS). MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED FROM THE BIOCHIPS WILL BE COMPARED TO STANDARD QRT-PCR AND ELISA METHODS. A TRANSITION PLAN WILL BE PREPARED FOR FDA EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA) APPLICATION OF THE BIOCHIP TECHNOLOGY THROUGH A COVID-19 CLINICAL TESTING LABORATORY AT OSU WEXNER MEDICAL CENTER. A COMMERCIALIZATION PLAN WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED VIA LICENSING TO A BIOTECH COMPANY. WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM WITH EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY, MICROFLUIDICS, MICRO/NANO-FABRICATION, INFECTIOUS DISEASES, AND CLINICAL COVID-19 PATIENT SAMPLE COLLECTION AND TESTING.

IN THE UNITED STATES, MORE THAN SIX MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED COVID-19 AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND PATIENTS HAVE DIED OF THIS DISEASE TO DATE. ALTHOUGH CURRENT COVID-19 DIAGNOSTIC TESTING TECHNOLOGIES ARE CRITICAL FOR SLOWING THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS AND PREVENTING FUTURE OUTBREAKS, THEY ARE NOT PRACTICAL FOR FIELD USE. CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC TESTS ARE CUMBERSOME TO PERFORM BECAUSE THEY USE AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS, REQUIRE MULTIPLE STEPS, AND HOURS-TO-DAYS TO OBTAIN RESULTS. SINCE THE US BEGAN TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY IN MAY, THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COVID-19 CASES. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP A DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH THAT IS NON-INVASIVE, PORTABLE, AND CAN RAPIDLY PROVIDE TEST RESULTS.  THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A MOBILE BREATH ANALYSIS TECHNOLOGY FOR RAPID SCREENING FOR COVID-19 USING A HANDHELD BREATH COLLECTION TOOL AND A PORTABLE GC WITH A PHOTOIONIZATION DETECTOR (PID). THE HANDHELD TOOL WILL BE A CLOSED SYSTEM FOR TRAPPING SELECT VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS) ON A MICROFABRICATED CHIP. THE CAPTURED VOCS WILL BE ELUTED WITH ETHANOL AND THEN ANALYZED USING A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, PORTABLE GC-PID INSTRUMENT. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS WILL BE APPLIED TO RECOGNIZE THE VOC PATTERN THAT CORRELATES WITH COVID-19 INFECTION. THE CENTRAL INNOVATION IS THE MICROFABRICATED CHIP THAT CAPTURES CARBONYL COMPOUNDS IN EXHALED BREATH AND THUS SERVES AS A PRECONCENTRATOR, WHICH ENABLES ANALYSIS OF CARBONYL VOCS BY THE PORTABLE GC-PID. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE CARBONYL METABOLOME IN EXHALED BREATH IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE BODY\u2019S REACTION TO THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS INFECTION, AND CHANGES IN THE CARBONYL VOC COMPOSITION IN EXHALED BREATH RELATIVE TO HEALTHY CONTROLS CAN BE USED TO DETECT BOTH SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC COVID-19 PATIENTS.  THREE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED TO FULFILL THE OVERALL GOAL. AIM 1 IS TO BUILD A DISPOSABLE HANDHELD BREATH ANALYZER TOOL FOR CONCENTRATING CARBONYL VOCS.

IN ADDITION TO CHALLENGES RELATED TO AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF HOME TESTING, THE PRIVACY AFFORDED BY HOME TESTING COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF SURVEILLANCE INFORMATION. HOME TESTS ARE RARELY REPORTED TO PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE, AND SPECIMENS ARE UNAVAILABLE FOR GENETIC SEQUENCING AND VARIANT DETECTION. THIS RESULTS IN A SUBSTANTIAL GAP IN PUBLIC HEALTH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT COVID-19 BURDEN OF DISEASE AND CIRCULATING VARIANTS, WHICH MAY BE PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR BLACK COMMUNITIES WITH HIGHER RISK FOR ADVERSE OUTCOMES. WE PROPOSE A PRE-POST INTERVENTION STUDY BASED IN BLACK COMMUNITIES IN ATLANTA, GA TO ASSESS WILLINGNESS OF RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS TO USE A COVID-19 RAPID HOME TEST AND TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MAIL A SELF-COLLECTED ANTERIOR NARES SAMPLE TO A COMMERCIAL LABORATORY FOR CONFIRMATORY PCR TESTING. WE WILL PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT ORAL AND ILLUSTRATED WRITTEN COMMUNICATION MESSAGES ENCOURAGING CONTINUED COVID-19 VIGILANCE AND HOME TESTING ALONGSIDE SELF-COLLECTION OF A SPECIMEN FOR MAIL-OFF TESTING. THESE MESSAGES WILL BE PACKAGED WITH A HOME TEST KIT FOR RAPID TESTING AND SELF- COLLECTING AND MAILING A SECOND SPECIMEN TO A LABORATORY. IF A SUBSET OF HOME TESTERS WERE WILLING TO SELF-COLLECT AND MAIL A SPECIMEN FOR CONFIRMATORY TESTING, MULTIPLIER METHODS COULD BE USED TO ESTIMATE BURDEN OF DISEASE AND CIRCULATING VARIANTS AMONG HOME TESTERS. HOWEVER, PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL MISTRUST MAY NOT ELECT TO SHARE BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS FOR SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES. WE AIM TO UNDERSTAND MOTIVATIONS AND BARRIERS FOR USING THIS TYPE OF TESTING MODALITY IN BLACK COMMUNITIES WHILE ALSO ASSESSING GENERAL KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND BEHAVIORS RELATED TO HOME TESTING.

IN 2020 ALONE, IT WILL COST A MILLION LIVES. IT CONTINUES TO WREAK ECONOMIC HAVOC WORLDWIDE. THEREFORE, IT IS CRITICAL TO DEVELOP NEW TOOLS THAT CAN MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF SARS- COV-2, THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19. RAPID SCREENING TOOLS CAN IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN THEN BE ISOLATED/QUARANTINED FROM THE UNINFECTED AND DIRECTED TOWARDS FURTHER TESTING AND TREATMENT. UNFORTUNATELY, DEFINITIVE VIRAL TESTING FOR SARS-COV-2 HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT IN MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE US, DUE TO TECHNICAL, FINANCIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL HURDLES TO UNIVERSAL ACCESS AND TIMELY PROCESSING. SYMPTOM-BASED SCREENING OFFERS A VALUABLE, ALBEIT IMPERFECT, COMPLEMENT TO VIRAL TESTING THAT CAN HELP IDENTIFY MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH THE DISEASE FOR ISOLATION AS WELL AS TREATMENT. A MAJOR CHALLENGE WITH SYMPTOMATIC TESTING IS THAT COVID-19 IS HIGHLY PROTEAN: THE HETEROGENEITY OF SYMPTOMS MEANS NO SINGLE SYMPTOM OR CONSTELLATION OF SYMPTOMS IS DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSTICALLY.

UNIVERSAL TESTING OFFERED AT HEMODIALYSIS FACILITIES COULD SHIELD THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION FROM EXPOSURE, ENABLE EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT FOR THOSE AFFECTED, AND REDUCE TRANSMISSION TO OTHER PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. IN OUR PRELIMINARY WORK, WE CREATED AN ACADEMIC-INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP WITH THE THIRD LARGEST DIALYSIS PROVIDER IN THE US (US RENAL CARE) AND A CENTRAL COMMERCIAL LABORATORY (ASCEND CLINICAL). WE EVALUATED SARS-COV-2 SEROPREVALENCE, RESPONSE TO INFECTION AND VACCINATION, AND VACCINE ACCEPTABILITY AMONG PATIENTS RECEIVING DIALYSIS. WE NOW PROPOSE TO BUILD ON THIS PARTNERSHIP TO IMPLEMENT AND COMPARE TWO TEST-BASED UNIVERSAL SCREENING STRATEGIES IN DIALYSIS FACILITIES, AND TO ASSESS VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS. IN A PRAGMATIC CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, WE WILL RANDOMIZE 62 US RENAL CARE FACILITIES WITH AN ESTIMATED 2480 PATIENTS TO STATIC VERSUS DYNAMIC UNIVERSAL SCREENING TESTING STRATEGIES. STATIC UNIVERSAL SCREENING WILL INVOLVE OFFERING PATIENTS SARS-COV-2 SCREENING TESTS EVERY TWO WEEKS; THE DYNAMIC UNIVERSAL SCREENING STRATEGY WILL VARY THE FREQUENCY OF TESTING FROM ONCE EVERY WEEK TO ONCE EVERY FOUR WEEKS, DEPENDING ON COMMUNITY COVID-19 CASE RATES. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT PATIENTS DIALYZING AT FACILITIES RANDOMIZED TO A DYNAMIC TESTING FREQUENCY RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY CASE RATES WILL HAVE HIGHER TEST ACCEPTABILITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME), EXPERIENCE LOWER RATES OF COVID-19 DEATH AND HOSPITALIZATION, AND REPORT BETTER EXPERIENCE-OF-CARE METRICS. SINCE PATIENTS RECEIVING DIALYSIS ACHIEVE SUBOPTIMAL RATES OF SEROCONVERSION POST INFLUENZA, HEPATITIS B, AND COVID-19 VACCINATION, WE WILL EMBED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF COVID-19 VACCINATION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS PRAGMATIC INTERVENTION.

BETWEEN A SHORTAGE IN TESTING AND UNIDENTIFIED ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS, THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF THOSE INFECTED COULD BE 6 TO 24-FOLD HIGHER THAN THAT REPORTED. SARS-COV-2 (COV-2), THE VIRUS UNDERLYING THE DISEASE, RESULTS IN A RANGE OF SYMPTOMS; IN SELECT CASES A SEVERE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS THAT IMPEDES BREATHING THAT COULD LEAD TO HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH. COV-2 IS TRANSMITTED PERSON-TO- PERSON VIA INHALATION OF THE VIRUS THROUGH MUCOSAL MEMBRANES OF THE NOSE AND THROAT FROM TRANSFER AFTER TOUCHING A CONTAMINATED SURFACE OR BY INHALING AEROSOLIZED VIRUS.

FREQUENT, LOW COST AND HIGHLY SCALABLE TESTING IS THE ONLY WAY TO GAIN VISIBILITY ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PANDEMIC AND ULTIMATELY CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. WE PROPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIQUE SYSTEM THAT CAN CHEAPLY AND READILY DETECT SARS-COV-2 IN SALIVA SAMPLES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM THAT USES SALIVA PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO READILY TEST PATIENTS USING A SAMPLE THAT IS EASILY COLLECTED AND HARBORS HIGH CONCENTRATION OF VIRAL PARTICLES. THE SARS-COV-2 PANDEMIC HAS PREDOMINANTLY AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS SUCH AS CLOTTING DISORDERS, DIABETES, HYPERTENSION OR OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES. PATIENTS WITH THESE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WHO THEN ARE INFECTED HAVE EXACERBATED SYMPTOMS AND COMPLICATIONS THAT CAN LEAD TO DEATH. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY PATIENTS THAT HAVE SUCCUMBED TO SARS-COV-2 INFECTION HAVE DEVELOPED BLOOD CLOTS THAT HAVE IMPAIRED PULMONARY OR CARDIAC FUNCTION AND ULTIMATELY CARDIAC FAILURE. A RAPID DIAGNOSTIC USING EASILY COLLECTED SAMPLES (E.G. SALIVA) WOULD ALLOW FOR INFECTIONS TO BE IDENTIFIED SOONER, THERAPIES TO BE ADMINISTERED QUICKER, TREATMENT TO BE MONITORED, AND ULTIMATELY LEADING TO FEWER INDIVIDUALS THAT SUCCUMB TO THE INFECTION. WE OUTLINE A NOVEL DNA STAR BIOSENSING APPROACH BASED ON THE FACT THAT VIRUSES, SUCH AS SARS- COV-2, EXPRESS UNIQUE SPATIAL PATTERNS OF ANTIGENS ON THEIR SURFACES, FACILITATING MULTIVALENT BINDING TO HOST CELLS FOR INFECTION. THESE CONFIGURATIONS OF EPITOPES DRIVE THE HIGH SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF OUR ASSAY. BASED ON THIS NATURALLY OCCURRING BINDING MECHANISM, WE DEVELOPED A RATIONAL DESIGN APPROACH PRODUCING PATTERN MATCHING DESIGNER DNA ARCHITECTURE FOR VIRAL SENSING. A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT DENGUE VIRUS (DENV) RAPID DIAGNOSTICS WAS DEVELOPED TO DEMONSTRATE ITS POWER: DENV SURFACE ANTIGENS PRESENT THE MOST COMPLEX GEOMETRIC PATTERN AMONG ALL KNOWN PATHOGENS, A DNA STAR LINKED 10-APTAMERS NANOSTRUCTURE THAT OFFERS POLYVALENT, SPATIAL DENV- EPITOPE PATTERN MATCHING INTERACTIONS HAS PROVIDED HIGH DENV-BINDING AVIDITY AND SPECIFICITY, INCREASING AFFINITY BY ~1,000\u00d7 COMPARED TO THE CONVENTIONAL APTAMER APPROACH WHICH RELIES ON MONOVALENT APTAMER-EPITOPE INTERACTIONS.

WHILE SEVERAL DIAGNOSTIC METHODS ARE NOW AVAILABLE, MOST TESTS ARE EITHER REAGENT-INTENSIVE AND MUST BE DONE IN CLIA-APPROVED LABS, MAKING THEM EXPENSIVE AND SLOW TO REPORT RESULTS, OR RAPID AND INEXPENSIVE, BUT POTENTIALLY LACKING IN SENSITIVITY. IN THE U.S., SERIOUSLY ILL AND HIGH- RISK PATIENTS HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZED FOR TESTING, CAUSING STATES TO MISS MILD AND ASYMPTOMATIC CASES, SOME OF WHICH ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE SPREADERS OF THE VIRUS. HOWEVER, EXPANDING TESTING HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE DUE TO SHORTAGES OF SAMPLING SWABS AND KEY REAGENTS FOR NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION-BASED TESTS, WHICH ARE THE MOST POPULAR OPTION. TESTING CAPABILITIES MUST BE EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY TO ENABLE MASS POPULATION-LEVEL TESTING OF ALL PATIENTS, HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES, OTHER CRITICAL KEY WORKERS, AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO BRING THE PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. MPOD PROPOSES TO EXPAND TESTING CAPABILITIES THROUGH A NOVEL BIOSENSOR THAT WILL USE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE MOLECULES CALLED APTAMERS TO BIND TO UNIQUE SITES ON THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS. APTAMERS HAVE SIMILAR BINDING AFFINITIES TO ANTIBODIES, BUT DUE TO THEIR SMALLER SIZE, THEY ARE MORE AGILE, MAKING THEM PARTICULARLY SUITED FOR HIGH-SPECIFICITY BINDING.

IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MIT, INNOTECH PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTIPLEXED SENSOR PLATFORM BASED ON NANOMATERIALS CAPABLE OF MOLECULAR BINDING AND SUBSEQUENT REPORTING. WE WILL DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A MULTIPLEXED SENSOR PLATFORM USING NANOMATERIAL REPORTERS CAPABLE OF RAPID SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION OF MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF VIRAL PARTICLES IN A FIELD APPLICABLE ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE. FOR OUR PHASE I- AIM 1 WE WILL FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF SYNTHETIC BIOSENSORS FOR ACCURATE DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2 VIRAL PROTEINS AND NUCLEIC ACID. OUR MILESTONE IS THE DISCOVERY AND VALIDATION AN ARRAY OF MOLECULAR RECOGNITION BIOSENSORS AGAINST BOTH PROTEIN AND NUCLEIC ACID SEGMENTS OF SARS-COV-2. WE WILL COMPLETE THIS PHASE IN 4 MONTHS. IN PHASE II-AIM 1, WE WILL DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE ELECTROCHEMICAL DETECTORS. WE WILL UTILIZE THE SYNTHETIC BIOSENSORS IDENTIFIED AND VALIDATED IN AIM 1 TO AN ELECTROCHEMICAL PLATFORM FOR THE RAPID DETECTION OF AN ACTIVE SARS-COV-2 INFECTION USING MULTIPLE BIOMARKERS OF THE INFECTION. WE WILL SPECIFICALLY EMPLOY COMMERCIALLY-AVAILABLE, DISPOSABLE ELECTRODE PLATFORMS AND EXISTING POTENTIOSTATS FROM METROHM DROPSENS TO STREAMLINE SCALE-UP AND COMMERCIALIZATION. OUR MILESTONE, TO BE COMPLETED IN YEAR 1 OF PHASE II, IS TO HAVE A MULTIPLEX BIOSENSOR CHIP AND AN ALPHA PROTOTYPE WITH A MULTIPLEX BIOSENSOR CHIP AND A POTENTIOSTAT READER WHICH WE WILL BENCHMARK FOR SENSITIVITY AND QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY AGAINST EXISTING COVID-19 DIAGNOSTICS. IN PHASE II-AIM 2, WE WILL VALIDATE THE PROTOTYPE CHIPS AND DETECTORS WITH RETROSPECTIVE CLINICAL SPECIMENS IN PREPARATION FOR EUA-FDA SUBMISSION. WE WILL DETERMINE THE LOD, CLINICAL PERFORMANCE, AND CROSS-REACTIVITY WITH OTHER RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS AND NORMAL FLORA. THE MILESTONE FOR THIS AIM IS TO DOCUMENT A MULTIPLEX OF AT LEAST TWO PROTEINS AND TWO NUCLEIC ACID BIOSENSORS FOR SARS-COV-2 THAT WILL PROVIDE A LOD OF 5-20 VIRUSES PER MICROLITER IN AN ORAL SPECIMEN AND WILL BE CLINICALLY VALIDATED WITH GREATER THAN 95% CONCORDANCE WITH RT-PCR IN 30 POSITIVE AND 30 NEGATIVE SPECIMENS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 755999.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1832f3b5-c1fe-7d50-3d5f-3f27a0617538-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R42DE030829_7529"}, {"internal_id": 108463985, "Award ID": "R37CA245716", "Award Amount": 3682697.29, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-07", "CFDA Number": "93.393", "Description": "ADDRESSING LOW-INCOME HOUSING RESIDENT MISTRUST IN COVID-19 GUIDANCE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 1176228.29, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d97dff14-1826-f436-5817-b2496b9c59da-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R37CA245716_7529"}, {"internal_id": 92602539, "Award ID": "R34AT010661", "Award Amount": 1597728.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-11-29", "CFDA Number": "93.213", "Description": "SOCIAL, ETHICAL, AND BEHAVIORAL IMPLICATIONS (SEBI) RESEARCH ON COVID-19 TESTING AND VACCINE UPTAKE AMONG RURAL LATINO MIGRANTS IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": 967155.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ceec5ef7-d6a5-28f0-e23f-ec61155b7078-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R34AT010661_7529"}, {"internal_id": 154738669, "Award ID": "R33HD105619", "Award Amount": 3042485.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-12-01", "CFDA Number": "93.360", "Description": "COVID-19 NETWORK OF NETWORKS EXPANDING CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL APPROACHES TO PREDICT SEVERE ILLNESS IN CHILDREN (CONNECT TO PREDICT SICK CHILDREN) - THE SARS-COV-2 PANDEMIC HAS MANIFESTED IN CHILDREN WITH A WIDE SPECTRUM OF CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS RANGING FROM ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION TO DEVASTATING ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS, APPENDICITIS (OFTEN WITH RUPTURE), AND MULTISYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME IN CHILDREN (MIS-C), A SERIOUS INFLAMMATORY CONDITION PRESENTING SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER EXPOSURE TO OR INFECTION WITH THE VIRUS.

WHILE SOME PATIENTS IMPROVED WITH INTRAVENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULIN (IVIG) ALONE, MORE THAN 70% REQUIRED TREATMENT WITH STEROIDS, ANAKINRA (IL-1 BLOCKADE) AND/OR INFLIXIMAB (TNFA BLOCKADE). AS THERE WAS CLINICAL EQUIPOISE AS TO WHICH OF THESE THERAPIES WAS BEST FOR TREATING MIS-C, OUR PREVAIL KIDS (PREDICTING VIRAL-ASSOCIATED INFLAMMATORY DISEASE SEVERITY IN CHILDREN WITH LABORATORY DIAGNOSTICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INITIATIVE) TEAM AT UC SAN DIEGO DESIGNED AND LAUNCHED A TWO-SITE RANDOMIZED, CLINICAL TRIAL (MULTISYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME THERAPIES IN CHILDREN (MISTIC) COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDY). THE GOAL WAS TO DETERMINE WHICH COMBINATION OF THERAPIES (IVIG WITH STEROIDS, INFLIXIMAB AND/OR ANAKINRA) WAS MOST EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN CHILDREN WITH MIS-C (NCT04898231). THIS STUDY ENROLLED 74 SUBJECTS AND IS NOW CLOSED FOR ENROLLMENT AND UNDER ANALYSIS USING A NOVEL BAYESIAN JOINT STAGE MODEL APPLIED TO THE SNSMART DESIGN. AS PART OF MISTIC, SERUM, PLASMA AND WHOLE BLOOD RNA WERE COLLECTED PRE-IVIG AND 12 HOURS AFTER IVIG OR THE FIRST-RANDOMIZED THERAPY. IN THIS ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT, WE WILL EVALUATE THE MOLECULAR SIGNATURE OF MIS-C PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT THROUGH WHOLE BLOOD (WB) RNASEQ, PLASMA CELL FREE (CF) RNA, AND PLASMA PROTEOMICS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED TO CHILDREN WITH MIS-C. WE PROPOSE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. SPECIFIC AIM 1 WILL ANALYZE THE WBRNA PROFILES USING RNASEQ OF MIS-C PATIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER IVIG THERAPY, AND AFTER INFLIXIMAB, ANAKINRA, AND STEROID TREATMENT. SPECIFIC AIM 2 WILL ANALYZE THE CFRNA TISSUE OF ORIGIN PROFILE OF MIS-C PATIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER IVIG THERAPY, AND AFTER INFLIXIMAB, ANAKINRA AND STEROID TREATMENT. SPECIFIC AIM 3 WILL ANALYZE THE PLASMA PROTEOME OF MIS-C PATIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER IVIG THERAPY, AND AFTER INFLIXIMAB, ANAKINRA AND STEROID TREATMENT. THE SYNERGISTIC EXPERTISE OF THESE TWO PREVAIL TEAMS IN THIS MULTI-CENTER PROPOSAL PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND RESPONSE TO TREATMENT OF MIS- C, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY DEVELOP BIOMARKERS FOR THIS ACUTE, INFLAMMATORY CONDITION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 2513180.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ce42d274-7283-659b-de1c-e11666794c48-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R33HD105590_7529"}, {"internal_id": 85588746, "Award ID": "R33AG057395", "Award Amount": 3387755.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-13", "CFDA Number": "93.866", "Description": "USE OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS IN REPEAT SARS-COV-2 ANTIBODY TESTING IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 1271339.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "56e7333e-38ec-5402-80b8-4d50309afb4c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R33AG057395_7529"}, {"internal_id": 97014267, "Award ID": "R21MH122010", "Award Amount": 1281220.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-05-01", "CFDA Number": "93.360", "Description": "UNDERSTANDING THE COVID-19, RACISM, AND VIOLENCE SYNDEMIC AND ITS EFFECTS ON COVID-19 TESTING DISPARITIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": 911955.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fb8099df-df9c-1d96-f19c-f3a00b918c86-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21MH122010_7529"}, {"internal_id": 68566307, "Award ID": "R21MD013674", "Award Amount": 2598137.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-09-17", "CFDA Number": "93.310", "Description": "POST-HURRICANE CANCER CARE: PATIENT NEEDS AFTER HURRICANE MARIA", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PR", "COVID-19 Obligations": 1936589.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "5b92c29d-65d9-6d2d-5d94-3ca522aa209f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21MD013674_7529"}, {"internal_id": 146399727, "Award ID": "R01NR020105", "Award Amount": 3304920.63, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-18", "CFDA Number": "93.360", "Description": "MULTI-MODAL WIRELESS COVID MONITORING & INFECTION ALERTS FOR CONCENTRATED POPULATIONS - MULTI-MODAL WIRELESS COVID MONITORING & INFECTION ALERTS FOR CONCENTRATED POPULATIONS ABSTRACT: THE HIGH AEROSOLIZED TRANSMISSIBILITY OF COVID, LONG ASYMPTOMATIC INCUBATION PERIOD, AND HIGHLY VARIABLE PRESENTATION ATTRIBUTES OF THE COVID PANDEMIC HAVE PROVEN CHALLENGING IN MANY SETTINGS WHERE PATCHWORK PANDEMIC RESPONSES HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED VULNERABLE SOCIOECONOMIC, MINORITY, AND DISABLED SUB-POPULATIONS.

UNFORTUNATELY, NO SUCH SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM YET EXISTS. HERE, WE PROPOSE A \u201cSMART MASK\u201d THAT CHANGES COLORS WHEN THE WEARER HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO BIOMARKERS (PROTEASES) OF COVID-19. THESE PROTEASES ARE KNOWN TO BE IN SALIVA, AND THE SMART MASK WILL CONCENTRATE THE PROTEASES FROM AEROSOLIZED SALIVA WHEN THE SUBJECT BREATHES AND SPEAKS THROUGH THE SMART MASK. THIS IS A SIMPLE YET NOVEL APPROACH TO SURVEILLANCE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE ALREADY WEARING MASKS\u2014ESPECIALLY IN HIGH- RISK SETTINGS. OUR FIRST GOAL IS TO OPTIMIZE THE REAGENTS THAT WILL MONITOR THE PROTEASES. WE WILL CUSTOMIZE THE PEPTIDE SEQUENCES SUCH THAT THE REAGENTS CHANGE COLOR ONLY WHEN TWO KEY SARS PROTEASES ARE PRESENT. AFTER CHARACTERIZING THE COLORIMETRIC REAGENTS, AIM 2 WILL INTEGRATE THESE REAGENTS INTO AN ADHESIVE STRIP (I.E., A STICKER) THAT CAN BE AFFIXED TO ANY EXISTING CLOTH OR SURGICAL MASK.

SAN DIEGO MPRINT CET, ENTITLED \u201cOPTIMIZATION OF ANTIBIOTICS IN MOTHERS AND THEIR BREASTFED INFANTS USING PHARMACOMICROBIOMIC AND METABOLOMIC ANALYSES\u201d, BRINGS TOGETHER A TEAM OF HIGHLY EXPERIENCED AND PROVEN COLLABORATIVE INVESTIGATORS WITH LEADERSHIP ROLES IN MATERNAL AND PEDIATRIC CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES. ACROSS ITS HIGHLY INTEGRATED AND SYNERGISTIC COMPONENTS, THE UCSD MPRINT CET ADDRESSES CRITICAL BARRIERS IN MATERNAL-INFANT PHARMACOLOGY REGARDING (1) THE PHARMACOKINETICS OF INFANT EXPOSURE TO MATERNAL ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT VIA BREASTMILK OR CLOSE CONTACT, (2) THE IMPACT OF MATERNAL ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY OR PROPHYLAXIS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NORMAL INFANT MICROBIOME AND GUT METABOLOME, (3) POTENTIAL DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF SUCH ANTIBIOTIC EXPOSURE ON INFANT IMMUNE FUNCTION AND HEPATIC CYTOCHROME P450 DRUG METABOLIZING ENZYMES, AND (4) THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF BREAST MILK BOTH AS A CONDUIT FOR ANTIBIOTIC TRANSFER AND SOURCE OF BENEFICIAL HUMAN/MAMMALIAN MILK OLIGOSACCHARIDES (HMOS/MMOS) THAT MAY SUPPORT MICROBIOME AND IMMUNE INTEGRITY IN FACE OF ANTIBIOTIC STRESS. THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION AND OUTCOME OF OUR MPRINT CET IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH 3 PROJECTS (CLINICAL, BASIC SCIENCE AND DATA SCIENCE) AN ADMINISTRATIVE CORE AND TWO TECHNOLOGY CORES, THE MILK ANALYTICS CORE (MAC) AND PHARMACOMETRICS AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY CORE (PACC). IN THE CLINICAL PROJECT \u201cANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT IN BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS: EFFECTS ON MILK, MICROBIOME, AND INFANT OUTCOMES\u201d, WE HAVE PROVEN EXPERTISE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND ACCESS TO A HIGH ENROLLING MATERNAL-INFANT CLINICAL COHORT TO STUDY HOW MATERNAL ANTIBIOTICS ALTER BREAST MILK COMPOSITION AND IMPACT INFANT OUTCOMES IN CLINICAL MEANINGFUL WAYS. IN THE BASIC SCIENCE PROJECT \u201cTHE IMPACT OF AMPICILLIN AND BREAST MILK OLIGOSACCHARIDES ON THE INFANT MICROBIOME AND IMMUNE FUNCTIONS\u201d, WE LEVERAGE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN MOUSE MODELS OF NEONATAL HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS TO PROBE FUNCTIONAL EFFECTS OF AMPICILLIN AND MMOS ON INFANT IMMUNE FUNCTION, INCLUDING A NOVEL CROSS-FOSTERING STRATEGY WITH WILD-TYPE AND MMO-DEFICIENT MOTHERS. IN OUR DATA SCIENCE PROJECT \u201cIMPACT OF MATERNAL ANTIBIOTICS ON THE BREASTFEEDING INFANT MICROBIOME AND METABOLOME\u201d, WE DEPLOY ADVANCED MS TECHNOLOGY, NON-INVASIVE SAMPLING AND INNOVATIVE MOLECULAR NETWORKING ANALYTICS IN A CUTTING-EDGE STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF BREAST MILK ANTIBIOTIC EXPOSURE ON THE INFANT MICROBIOME, METABOLOME AND HEPATIC CYP ENZYMES. THE MAC PROVIDES MILK COLLECTION PROTOCOLS AND KITS, NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY AND HPLC, HMO/MMO AND NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION ANALYSIS, AND NEW ASSAY VALIDATION EXPANDING OUR MPRINT CET ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES, WHILE THE PAC DEVELOPS AND VALIDATES NOVEL QUANTITATIVE ASSAYS AND PHYSIOLOGIC AND SEMI-PHYSIOLOGIC MODELS TO DESCRIBE AND PREDICT MATERNAL AND INFANT ANTIBIOTIC PK DURING BREASTFEEDING. OUR ADMINISTRATIVE CORE OVERSEES INTEGRATION AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR RESEARCH PROJECTS/CORES AND THEIR MILESTONES, CONNECTING THEM TO THE NATIONAL MPRINT CET HUB AND UNIQUE TRAINING/PILOT PROJECTS.",
