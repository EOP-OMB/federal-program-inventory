OPIOID USE DISORDER IS WIDESPREAD WITHIN THE PROPOSED SERVICE AREA. ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\u2019S NORC APPALACHIAN OVERDOSE MAPPING TOOL, THE OVERDOSE MORTALITY RATE FROM 2015-2019 FOR CARTER COUNTY WAS 66.1 PER 100,000 POPULATION. THIS RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE KENTUCKY RATE OF 48.5, THE APPALACHIAN RATE OF 43.6, AND MORE THAN DOUBLE THE U.S. RATE OF 28.7. PERHAPS EVEN MORE NOTABLE IS THE CHANGE IN THE OVERDOSE DEATH RATE BY +26. 5 DEATHS PER 100,000 POPULATION IN CARTER COUNTY FROM THE PRECEDING FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 AND AN INCREASED USE OF THE MORE DEADLY FENTANYL, THE RATE AS OF JUNE 2021 WAS EVEN GREATER, AT 79 PER 100,000! RESIDENTS OF THE SERVICE AREA ALSO EXPERIENCE MANY ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO ACCESSING ALL FORMS OF HEALTH CARE, BUT PARTICULARLY SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT, WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE. KENTUCKY IS RANKED AS THE 46TH-POOREST STATE IN THE NATION, AND THE SERVICE AREA HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PER-CAPITA INCOMES THAN THE STATE AS A WHOLE. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE SERVICE AREA POPULATION WITH NO HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA IS NEARLY DOUBLE BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL RATES. CARTER COUNTY ALSO HAS BELOW-AVERAGE PERCENTAGES OF THE POPULATION WITH POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO HIGHER RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT IN THE SERVICE AREA. THOSE WHO ABUSE OPIOIDS GENERALLY HAVE LOWER LEVELS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY, AND A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING AN ARREST RECORD.   THIS PROJECT WILL TARGET SEVERAL POPULATIONS WITHIN CARTER COUNTY WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY SUFFERED FROM POORER HEALTH OUTCOMES OR HEALTH DISPARITIES, AS COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE TARGET POPULATION. PERSONS LEAVING INCARCERATION WITH SUD/OUD ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AS A RESULT OF LIMITED RECOVERY HOUSING OPTIONS AND THE REGULATIONS OR CONSTRAINTS THAT PROHIBIT THEM FOR ACCESSING HOUSING; AS A RESULT, WE WILL REPLICATE OUR FIRST DAY FORWARD REENTRY PROGRAM IN CARTER COUNTY TO ENGAGE WITH INMATES AND CONNECT THEM TO HOUSING, TREATMENT, RECOVERY RESOURCES, EMPLOYMENT, AND OTHER SERVICES POST-RELEASE.

THE PROJECT'S GOAL IS TO EXPAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES TO AREAS THAT HAVE A CRITICAL NEED AND A LACK OF SERVICE PROVIDERS. PEOPLE LIVING IN RURAL AREAS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE NOTABLY UNDERSERVED AND DISADVANTAGED. BY COLLABORATING WITH THE SYRINGE SERVICE PROGRAMS (SSPS), OTHER MAT AND ADDICTION SERVICE PROVIDERS, COUNSELING CENTERS, COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS, AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THOSE CLIENTS WHO ARE FREQUENTLY MARGINALIZED OR HAVE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO CARE WILL HAVE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM OF DIMINISHED ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE FOR VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES, HOUSELESS PERSONS, THOSE INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND THOSE EXPERIENCING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER - ALL OF WHOM ARE RURAL RESIDENTS.  KEY PRIMARY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE: THE TARGETED NUMBER OF PATIENTS WILL ENGAGE WITH THERAPY SERVICES THAT SUPPLEMENT THE SERVICES THEY ARE ALREADY RECEIVING FROM PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. PATIENTS WHO NEED A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE WILL RECEIVE REFERRALS. SCREENINGS FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EVENTS AND IMPAIRMENTS IN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WILL OCCUR ROUTINELY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE: A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF UNDERSERVED PATIENTS IN RURAL TARGET AREAS. A DECREASE IN OVERDOSE FATALITY RATES IN TARGET AREAS. AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RURAL RESIDENTS CURED FOR HEPATITIS C (HCV) AND ENTERING TRE ATMENT FOR HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV).

THE NEED FOR HRSA SUPPORT IS EVEN MORE EVIDENT WHEN CONSIDERING THE IMPACT THAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND CO-OCCURRING ADVERSE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES HAVE ON MARION COUNTY RESIDENTS. IN 2019, 5% OF YOUTH MISUSED PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS AND 9% OF ADULTS REPORTED MISUSE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, WHICH INCREASED TO 18% FOR ADULTS WITH INCOMES EARNING LESS THAN $25,000. THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT OF ADULTS ARE LIMITED BY PHYSICAL, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OR EMOTIONAL DISORDERS. A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF MARION COUNTY ADULTS SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION AT A RATE OF 25% WHEN COMPARED TO OHIO (20%) AND US (20%) IN 2019.

ALL THREE COUNTIES ARE FULLY DESIGNATED AS RURAL COUNTIES BY HRSA. LIKE MOST OF THE STATE, THE SERVICE AREA HAS BEEN HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL TARGET OUR SERVICES TOWARDS RESI DENTS OF THE SERVICE AREA WHO HAVE UNMET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS INCLUDING SUD/OUD. OUR INTERVENTIONS WILL INCLUDE DIRECT SERVICES THROUGH CARE COORDINATION AND COMMUNITY WIDE PREVENTION, OUTREACH AND EDUCATION, AND COLLABORATION INITIATIVES. APPALACHIAN KENTUCKY HAS A RICH CULTURE AND HISTORY, BUT THE REGION HAS FACED MANY STRUGGLES. THE TARGET POPULATION FACES POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES, WHICH ARE COMPOUNDED BY SOCIOECONOMIC AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT MAKE ACCESSING THE CARE THEY NEED DIFFICULT. THE SERVICE AREA HAS A TOTAL POPULATION OF 127,354. AS WITH MANY RURAL AREAS, THERE IS LIMITED RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY. THE POVERTY RATE IN THE REGION IS OVER 10 PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL RATE WITH AN INCREDIBLY HIGH RATE OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN EXTREME POVERTY (INCOMES LESS THAN 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL). WHILE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ACROSS KENTUCKY IS ON PAR WITH THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, IT IS MUCH HIGHER IN THE SERVICE AREA AT 6.4% COMPARED TO 4.6% NATIONALLY. IN THE SERVICE AREA, RESIDENTS REPORT AN AVERAGE OF 4.6 MENTALLY UNHEALTHY DAYS REPORTED IN THE LAST 30 DAYS, WHERE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH GOT IN THE WAY OF DAILY LIVING.  NEARLY A QUARTER (24.5%) OF THE POPULATION REPORTS THAT THEY LACK SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT, WHICH IS HIGHER THAN STATE (19.7%) AND NATIONAL (20.7%) RATES. THE RATE OF OVERDOSE MORTALITY WAS 45.5 PER 100,000 WITH THE HIGHEST RATE IN KNOX COUNTY AT 55.3 PER 100,000. THE SERVICE AREA RATE IS COMPARABLE TO THE STATE RATE OF 48.5 BUT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL RATE OF 28.7 PER 100,000. IN THE PAST THREE YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED ROLE OF FENTANYL IN OVERDOSE DEATHS. OF ALL OVERDOSE DEATHS, 34% INCLUDED FENTANYL ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH HEROIN.   IN 2020, FENTANYL OVERDOSE WAS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG THOSE AGES 18-45, SURPASSING COVID-19, CAR ACCIDENTS, CANCER AND SUICIDE. POOR HEALTH IS A MAJOR FACTOR FOR MANY IN THE SERVICE AREA.

HISTORICALLY, THIS CULTURALLY ISOLATED COMMUNITY WAS RAVAGED BY OVERLY CONTROLLING RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE FROM WARREN JEFFS (JEFFS), THE FUNDAMENTALIST CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS (FLDS) LEADER. JEFFS\u2019 FORMER LEADERSHIP AND RESTRICTIONS LEFT THE RURAL COMMUNITY ECONOMICALLY, SOCIALLY, AND MEDICALLY DEVASTATED. UNDER HIS RELIGIOUS PROPHECY IN THE 1990S, LOCAL HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES CONTRIBUTED TO WIDESPREAD TRAUMA AND INCREASING RATES OF POVERTY, CHRONIC DISEASE, DEPRESSION, SUICIDE, ALCOHOL USE, AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD). THESE COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS HAVE HEIGHTENED TO NEW LEVELS BY THE AREA\u2019S GEOGRAPHICAL ISOLATION, AS WELL AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS\u2019 HISTORIC MISTRUST OF OUTSIDE SOCIAL SERVICES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORT.
