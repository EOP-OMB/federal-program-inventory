IN ARIZONA, BOBCATS ARE SYMPATRIC WITH OTHER CLOSELY RELATED HOST SPECIES, SUCH AS PUMAS (PUMA CONCOLOR) AND DOMESTIC CATS (FELIS CATUS), CREATING THE POTENTIAL FOR BOBCATS TO SERVE AS LINKS IN DISEASE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN HUMANS, DOMESTIC ANIMALS, AND WILDLIFE SPECIES AT THE WUI. THIS MAY PUT BOBCATS AND OTHER WILDLIFE AT INCREASED RISK OF INFECTION BY PATHOGENS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DOMESTIC ANIMALS (ESPECIALLY DOMESTIC CATS) AND EVEN HUMANS (FOR EXAMPLE, SARS-COV-2), AS WELL AS EXPOSE HUMANS TO PATHOGENS WITH ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL. THEREFORE, SURVEYING PATHOGENS IN WIDESPREAD, GENERALIST CARNIVORES SUCH AS BOBCATS CAN ELUCIDATE DISEASE THREATS AT THE NEXUS OF ANIMAL, HUMAN, AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH (ONE HEALTH). ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: WE AIM TO EMPLOY A TARGETED VIROME SEQUENCING APPROACH TO SURVEY BOTH KNOWN AND NOVEL VIRUSES IN A POPUL ATION OF URBAN BOBCATS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TUCSON, ARIZONA, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE BOBCATS IN TUCSON PROJECT. USING PAIRED HOST AND VIRAL GENOMIC DATA, WE WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: 1) CHARACTERIZE FECAL AND ORAL VIROME COMPOSITION, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF KNOWN AND NOVEL VIRAL DISEASE THREATS TO BOBCATS AND OTHER WILDLIFE, HUMANS, AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS; ASSESS CONCORDANCE OF VIROME COMPOSITION OF BOTH SAMPLE TYPES USING TWIST BIOSCIENCE\u2019S COMPREHENSIVE VIRAL RESEARCH PANEL. 2) VALIDATE ABILITY OF TWIST BIOSCIENCE\u2019S COMPREHENSIVE VIRAL RESEARCH PANEL TO DETECT SARS-COV-2 THROUGH COMPARING RESULTS WITH RTPCR-BASED DETECTIONS FROM THE SAME FECAL AND BUCCAL SWAB SAMPLES (POSITIVE CONTROLS) 3) IDENTIFY KEY DRIVERS OF FECAL/ORAL VIROME DIVERSITY, INCLUDING DETERMINING THE ROLES OF SPATIAL PROXIMITY AND HOST GENETIC FACTORS (SUCH AS GENETIC DIVERSITY, RELATEDNESS, AND GENE FLOW) IN SHAPING VIROME COMPOSITION. . EXPECTED OUTCOMES: THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EMPLOY A TARGETED VIROME SEQUENCING APPROACH TO SURVEY BOTH KNOWN AND NOVEL VIRUSES IN A POPULATION OF URBAN BOBCATS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TUCSON, ARIZONA. THROUGH THIS APPROACH, WE AIM TO DETECT PATHOGENS RELEVANT TO THE HEALTH OF BOBCATS AND OTHER WILDLIFE, DOMESTIC ANIMALS, AND HUMANS, AS WELL AS GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE TRANSMISSION OF VIRUSES TO AND WITHIN THIS POPULATION AT THE WUI. WE SPECIFICALLY AIM TO VALIDATE THE UTILITY OF THIS APPROACH FOR DETECTING SARS-COV-2 IN BOBCAT SCAT AND BUCCAL SWABS, SINCE THIS VIRUS POSES HEALTH THREATS TO HUMANS AND FELIDS ALIKE. WE ALSO SEEK TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE VIROME COMPOSITION THROUGH INTEGRATING ADDITIONAL DATASETS (I.E., LOCATION AND HOST GENOMIC DATA). THIS IS THE FIRST PROJECT TO PERFORM BROAD VIRUS SURVEILLANCE/MONITORING OF A WILD BOBCAT POPULATIONS THAT WE ARE AWARE OF.

TO ADEQUATELY DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL FOR MULTIPLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE SPECIES AND THE VULTURE-HUMAN CONFLICTS THAT EXIST AND APPEAR TO BE INCREASING, MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO ASSESS THESE GAPS IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIES. PROJECT PERSONNEL PROPOSE THE CONTINUATION OF A PROJECT INVOLVING BLACK VULTURE NEST MONITORING AND GPS TELEMETRY OF FLEDGLING VULTURES TO FILL SOME OF THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY LACK PROPER PARAMETER ESTIMATES ON THE POPULATION OR THEIR BEHAVIORS. SPECIFICALLY, THE OBJECTIVES/DELIVERABLES ARE 1 . DETERMINE THE FATE OF BLACK VULTURE NESTS, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF NEST PREDATORS WITHIN THE MID-SOUTH; 2. OBTAIN NEST SURVIVAL AND CHICK TO FLEDGLING RECRUITMENT ESTIMATES; 3. ESTIMATE SURVIVAL, HOME RANGE, AND MOVEMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF FLEDGLING BLACK VULTURES.  TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS, PROJECT PERSONNEL WILL DEPLOY CAMERAS AT BLACK VULTURE NEST LOCATIONS IDENTIFIED IN SPRING 2020 AND 2021, PENDING RE-NESTING, AND ADDITIONAL NESTS LOCATED IN SPRING 2022. UPON FINDING A NEST, DATA RELATIVE TO THE NUMBER OF EGGS AND APPROXIMATE AGES WILL BE COLLECTED AND A TRAIL CAMERA WILL BE POSITIONED TO CAPTURE ANY EVENT THAT WOULD CAUSE NEST FAILURE OR CHICK MORTALITY. A SUBSET (N=10) OF FLEDGLING BIRDS WERE EQUIPPED WITH A GSM 20-70 GPS TRANSMITTER JUST PRIOR TO LEAVING THE NEST SITE. THESE TRANSMITTERS ARE CAPABLE OF COLLECTING HUNDREDS OF LOCATIONS DAILY BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND CAN REMAIN FUNCTIONAL FOR A PERIOD UP TO 4 YEARS. THIS DATA WILL BE COMPILED AND ANALYZED ON A SEASONAL BASIS TO ESTIMATE HOME RANGE, MOVEMENT RATES, HABITAT USE, AND SURVIVAL. IF TRANSMITTER LIFE ALLOWS, PERSONNEL WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE AGE AT WHICH THIS SPECIES REACHES REPRODUCTIVE MATURITY, A VITAL PARAMETER WITHIN POPULATION MODELS. SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT WILL BE DETERMINED BY EVALUATING THE NUMBER OF BLACK VULTURE NESTS MONITORED AND THE AMOUNT OF LOCATION DATA COLLECTED FROM THE GPS BACKPACKS.  THE METHODS USED TO DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT WILL REVOLVE AROUND THE COLLECTED DATA.
