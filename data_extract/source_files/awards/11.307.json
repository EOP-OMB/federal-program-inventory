THIS PROJECT WILL RESPOND TO REGIONAL ECONOMIC INJURY AS A RESULT OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AND CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING ECONOMIC RESILIENCY IN THE REGION BY ADDRESSING THE SHORTAGE OF AIRCRAFT TECHNICIANS RESULTING FROM AIR INDUSTRY INSTABILITY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND INCREASING THE LIMITED TRAINING CAPACITY IN THE STATE. GRADUATES OF THE TWO EXISTING PROGRAMS ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE PRESENTLY MEET APPROXIMATELY ONLY 50% OF THE ANNUAL DEMAND FOR AMTS IN THE STATE. THE PROJECT WILL NOT ONLY SUPPORT WORKFORCE DIVERSIFICATION AND ECONOMIC RESILIENCY, BUT ALSO AIMS TO INCREASE EQUITY IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, OFFERING A PATHWAY FOR ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS TO ACHIEVE UPWARD CAREER MOBILITY. APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE STUDENTS AT KIRKWOOD ARE CONSIDERED ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AS COMPARED TO A STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AVERAGE OF 24%, AND SERVING THESE STUDENTS WITH A FOCUS ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION IS A KEY STRATEGIC GOAL OF THE AMT PROGRAM AND THE COLLEGE. AS THE AIR TRAVEL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO RECOVER, QUALIFIED AMT'S WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR CONTINUED GROWTH, AND THIS PROJECT WILL ENSURE THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO FILL INCREASING NEEDS.
