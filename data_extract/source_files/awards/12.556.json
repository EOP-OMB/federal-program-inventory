THROUGH THIS PROJECT, SVUSD WILL ADDRESS IDENTIFIED MILITARY-CONNECTED STUDENT NEEDS AND BARRIERS TO THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. THE PROJECT GOALS ARE: 1. INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF MILITARY CONNECTED 3RD - 5TH GRADERS WHO MEET OR EXCEED STANDARDS ON THE STATE MATH ASSESSMENT AND 2. DECREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF MILITARY-CONNECTED 8TH GRADERS WHO ARE SUSPENDED. SVUSD MILITARY-CONNECTED STUDENTS HAVE GAPS IN BOTH THESE AREAS COMPARED TO PEERS ACROSS THE STATE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, SVUSD WILL IMPLEMENT THREE STRATEGIES: 1. IN-CLASS CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION SUPPORT: ROBUST TEACHER PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND COACHING IN MATH AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING (SEL) ENHANCE TOOLS FOR P.E. INCLUDING YOGA CURRICULUM AND AN HOLISTIC WELLNESS FOCUS WELLNESS SPACES FOR USE BY CLASSES AND SMALL GROUPS WHO NEED TARGET SUPPORT. 2. IN-CLASS TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTS: STUDENTS' MATH SKILL WILL DEVELOP WITH INDIVIDUALIZED EXACT PATH SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY TOOLS ENHANCE WELLNESS CURRICULUM LAPTOPS FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS ALLOW ACCESS EXACT PATH AND SEL CURRICULUM. 3.
