ALTHOUGH LESS THAN ONE-FIFTH OF THE U.S. POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS, THESE AREAS ENCOMPASS ABOUT 97% OF THE TOTAL LAND AREA IN THE UNITED STATES AND THUS THE POPULATION DENSITY FOR RURAL AREAS IS LOW. TRADITIONALLY, MAINSTREAM EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELS FOCUS ON SETTINGS WITH HIGH POPULATION DENSITY, SUCH AS MAJOR U.S. CITIES. TO STUDY RURAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELS AND ANALYSES TAILORED TO THE UNIQUE DEMOGRAPHICS AND GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION OF RURAL AREAS. THIS GRANT BRINGS TOGETHER EXPERTISE IN MATHEMATICAL MODELING, HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR RELIABLE AND ACCURATE REAL-TIME EPIDEMIC FORECASTS FOR MOUNTAIN-WEST STATES, SUCH AS WYOMING, MONTANA, IDAHO, AND COLORADO. THE PROJECT INVOLVES CONSTRUCTING A DATA-DRIVEN MULTISCALE MOBILITY NETWORK, USING THE COMBINATION OF DE-BIASED MOBILE PHONE DATA, AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY (ACS), AND CENSUS DATA IN THESE REGIONS. WITH A MULTISCALE MOBILITY NETWORK, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS (PIS) WILL BE ABLE TO EXAMINE HOW CONTAINMENT POLICIES DURING A PANDEMIC, SUCH AS MOBILITY REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS, STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS, AND STATE BORDER LOCKDOWNS, IMPACT THE TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, AND HOW SUCH POLICIES MAY EXACERBATE THE DISPARITIES OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL INEQUALITIES IN RURAL AREAS. THE STUDY WILL HELP GOVERNMENT HEALTH OFFICIALS DEVELOP EQUITABLE POLICIES AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR RURAL PLACES IN THE FUTURE EPIDEMIC. FURTHERMORE, THE PROPOSED COMMUNITY OUTREACH WILL RAISE AWARENESS OF DISEASE PREVENTION IN WYOMING. THIS GRANT OFFERS SOLUTIONS TO THREE RESEARCH QUESTIONS IN RURAL EPIDEMIOLOGY: Q1. HOW TO CONSTRUCT A METAPOPULATION MOBILITY NETWORK TAILORED TO RURAL PLACES? HUMAN MOBILITY IS ONE OF THE FACTORS DRIVING THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES ACROSS WIDE GEOGRAPHICAL RANGES. THE PROJECT INTRODUCES A METAPOPULATION MODEL EMBEDDED IN A MULTISCALE DATA-DRIVEN MOBILITY NETWORK TAILORED TO THE UNIQUE STRUCTURES OF RURAL POPULATION DENSITY AND HUMAN MOVING PATTERNS FOR SIMULATING INFECTION DYNAMICS OF THE FRONT-RANGE STATES. FOR THIS METAPOPULATION MOBILITY MODEL, THE PIS WILL ADAPT AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF GILLESPIE?S EVENT-DRIVEN ALGORITHMS AND DERIVE A PROPER TIME STEP FOR LARGE-SCALE STOCHASTIC SIMULATIONS. THE PIS WILL ALSO IMPLEMENT AN EFFICIENT PARTICLE FILTER ALGORITHM FOR DATA ASSIMILATIONS TO ESTIMATE LOCAL TRANSMISSION PARAMETERS AT TWO SCALES. Q2. HOW TO DETECT AND CORRECT MOBILE PHONE DATA BIAS? IF THE BIAS OF THE MOBILE PHONE DATA USED TO CONSTRUCT THE MOBILITY NETWORKS IS NOT ADDRESSED, INFECTION DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS MAY INCORRECTLY ESTIMATE THE SEVERITY AND SPEED OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION. THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE BIAS OF MOBILE PHONE DATA USED TO CONSTRUCT THE MOBILITY NETWORK AND DEVELOP A METHOD TO OFFSET THE DATA BIAS. Q3. WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF CONTAINMENT MEASURES ON DISADVANTAGED RACIAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS? THE PIS WILL USE THE PROPOSED UNBIASED MULTISCALE METAPOPULATION MOBILITY MODEL TO STUDY THE IMPACTS OF TEMPORARY MOBILITY REDUCTIONS AND THEIR LASTING BEHAVIOR-MODIFYING EFFECTS ON THE DISADVANTAGED RACIAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS IN THE FRONT-RANGE STATES.

THE INVESTIGATORS OF THIS PROJECT HYPOTHESIZE THAT HUMAN BEHAVIOR MAY ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN WHY DISEASES TRANSMITTED BY AEDES MOSQUITOES, SUCH AS DENGUE AND ZIKA, HAVE BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. AEDES MOSQUITOES LAY EGGS IN HOUSEHOLD WATER STORAGE CONTAINERS, MEANING THAT BEHAVIORS RELATED TO WATER STORAGE, WATER CONSUMPTION, AND WATER CONTAINER MANAGEMENT IMPACT MOSQUITO POPULATIONS AND, THEREBY, DISEASES TRANSMITTED BY THESE MOSQUITOES. THE CENTRAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HUMANS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT PREVENTIVE ACTIONS AGAINST AEDES-BORNE DISEASES AND HOW THOSE ACTIONS IN TURN AFFECT DISEASE DYNAMICS AND SUBSEQUENT INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DECISION-MAKING. THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON THE CITY OF IBAGU?, COLOMBIA, WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE LONG USED BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES TO INTERVENE AGAINST AEDES-BORNE DISEASES. EMPIRICAL SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE HOW INDIVIDUALS RESPOND TO THESE INTERVENTIONS AND CHARACTERIZE DIFFERENCES AMONG INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR RESPONSES. MATHEMATICAL MODELING RESEARCH WILL ESTIMATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS AT THE POPULATION LEVEL. THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT, A CLOSE CONNECTION WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WILL BE CULTIVATED TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVE TRANSLATION OF PROJECT OUTCOMES.

THE PROJECT WILL BE GROUNDED IN EMPIRICAL SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH IN IBAGUE?, A CITY IN COLOMBIA WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST URBANIZATION RATES AND AEDES-BORNE DISEASE TRANSMISSION RATES IN THE COUNTRY. A COMBINATION OF OBSERVATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES WILL BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE HETEROGENEITY IN THE ADOPTION OF MOSQUITO PREVENTION BEHAVIORS IN AND AROUND THE HOME AND TO UNDERSTAND THE CUES THAT DRIVE THE ADOPTION, OR NEGLECT, OF THOSE BEHAVIORS. THESE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF INDIVIDUAL DECISION-MAKING AROUND THE USE OF MOSQUITO PREVENTION BEHAVIORS IN RESPONSE TO INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL BEHAVIORAL DISPOSITIONS THAT CHANGE OVER TIME AS CUES ARISE AND SUBSIDE. THIS DECISION-MAKING MODEL WILL THEN BE INCORPORATED INTO AN AGENT-BASED MODEL OF AEDES-BORNE DISEASE TRANSMISSION THAT WILL BE USED TO INFER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS USE TO CONTROL AEDES-BORNE DISEASES IN IBAGUE?. FINALLY, A SUITE OF SIMPLER MACROSCOPIC MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND ASSESSED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ABILITY TO CAPTURE EFFECTS OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS ON EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS SIMULATED WITH THE AGENT-BASED MODEL.

IT IS THOUGHT THAT THESE PLANT COMMUNITIES HAVE EXISTED SINCE THE RETREAT OF THE GLACIERS APPROXIMATELY 13,000 YEARS AGO, SURVIVING THROUGH THE NATURAL CLIMATE CHANGES OF THE PAST AS WELL AS HUMAN-CAUSED WARMING OVER THE LAST CENTURY. THESE VULNERABLE ECOSYSTEMS ARE CULTURALLY IMPORTANT, DRAWING THOUSANDS OF HIKERS TO THESE PEAKS EVERY YEAR. THEY ALSO POSE A CHALLENGE FOR THE MANAGEMENT AGENCIES TASKED WITH PROTECTING THEM FROM CLIMATE CHANGE, TRAMPLING, OVERUSE, AND OTHER THREATS. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY MAY HOLD CLUES ABOUT HOW SMALL, ISOLATED POPULATIONS CAN SURVIVE PERIODS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. DOES THE ANSWER LIE IN THE PLANTS THEMSELVES, IN THEIR ABILITY TO ADAPT QUICKLY TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS?

AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE PLANTS DISAPPEARING, AND PERHAPS REAPPEARING, ON THESE MOUNTAINTOP ?ISLANDS? OVER TIME? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE WILL SAMPLE ALPINE LAKES IN THE ADIRONDACKS, THE GREEN MOUNTAINS OF VERMONT, THE WHITE MOUNTAINS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND KATAHDIN IN MAINE, ANALYZING THE DNA OF ANCIENT PLANTS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER SPECIES HAVE TRULY PERSISTED IN THE THOUSANDS OF YEARS SINCE THE END OF THE LAST ICE AGE.

THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO HELP SCIENTISTS, VOLUNTEERS, AND MANAGERS UNDERSTAND HOW BETTER TO SUPPORT NOT ONLY ALPINE PLANTS ACROSS THE NORTHEAST, BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE RARE OR ISOLATED SPECIES ARE FACED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER THREATS. THIS PROJECT WILL INTEGRATE TOOLS FROM PALEOECOLOGY, COMMUNITY ECOLOGY, TRAIT ECOLOGY, POPULATION GENOMICS, AND GEOGRAPHY TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ALPINE PLANT COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTHEAST ASSEMBLED AND PERSISTED. FOCUSING ON THE ADIRONDACKS (NY), THE GREEN (VT) AND WHITE (NH) MOUNTAINS, AND KATAHDIN (ME), THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL FIRST CHARACTERIZE THE LAST ~13,000 YEARS OF VEGETATION DYNAMICS AT THE SPECIES LEVEL USING ANCIENT DNA FROM ALPINE SEDIMENT CORES. TO CHARACTERIZE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO HISTORIC WARMING, THEY WILL THEN CONDUCT PLANT SURVEYS TO ESTIMATE SPECIES TURNOVER OVER THE LAST CENTURY BY COMPARING MODERN-DAY FLORA WITH HISTORIC SURVEY RECORDS. THE TEAM WILL THEN COMBINE DATA FROM COMMON GARDEN EXPERIMENTS, MICROCLIMATE SENSOR ARRAYS, FUNCTIONAL TRAIT ANALYSES, AND COALESCENT MODELING FROM POPULATION GENOMIC DATA TO REVEAL PAST AND CONTEMPORARY DEMOGRAPHIC DYNAMICS AND CLARIFY THE RELATIVE ROLES OF MICROREFUGIA, PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY, AND LOCAL ADAPTATION IN DRIVING BIODIVERSITY TURNOVER ACROSS MILLENNIAL, CENTENNIAL, AND DECADAL TIMESCALES.

ANDEREGG, DIRECTOR OF THE WILKES CENTER FOR CLIMATE SCIENCE AND POLICY AND ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH IS RECOGNIZED FOR HIS OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECOLOGICAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH. HIS NOVEL RESEARCH USES A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY FOCUS TO ADDRESS THE GREATEST ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FACING THE U.S. AND THE WORLD TODAY. DR. ANDEREGG?S LANDMARK PAPERS ON ASPEN FORESTS LINKED THE RISK OF DROUGHT MORTALITY WITH FUNDAMENTAL TREE PHYSIOLOGY, THE THRESHOLD LOSS OF VASCULAR FUNCTION. HE SHOWED HOW PHYSIOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL COMPONENTS OF FORESTS, SUCH AS DIVERSITY OF WATER-TRANSPORT STRATEGIES, DETERMINE FOREST RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE STRESSES. HE LED A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF DISTINGUISHED RESEARCHERS TO PROVIDE A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR FOREST CLIMATE MITIGATION IN 2020 AND FOLLOWED UP WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED AND COMPREHENSIVE RISK ANALYSIS FOR THE EARTH?S FORESTS OVER THE 21ST CENTURY IN 2022. HIS WORK ADVANCES THE BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF MECHANISMS DRIVING PLANT SENSITIVITY TO DROUGHT, WITH CLEAR LINKS TO WIDESPREAD TREE-MORTALITY EVENTS OF THE LAST TWO DECADES ACROSS THE WESTERN U.S. (I.E., THE ?MEGADROUGHT?). HIS WORK ELUCIDATES THE IMPORTANCE OF BIODIVERSITY TO THE SUSTAINABLE FUNCTIONING OF FOREST ECOSYSTEMS UNDER WATER-LIMITED CONDITIONS REGIONALLY AND GLOBALLY AND IS CRITICAL TO ADVANCING THE UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND DEVELOPING SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICES FOR FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. THROUGHOUT HIS SCIENTIFIC CAREER, DR. ANDEREGG HAS RECEIVED NUMEROUS NSF AWARDS, INCLUDING AN NSF CAREER GRANT IN 2021.

PLANTS OFTEN USE VARIATION IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT AS A CUE TO REPRODUCE, ENSURING, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS ADEQUATE ENERGY AND MOISTURE FOR FRUIT DEVELOPMENT OR THAT THEIR SEEDS ARE DISPERSED WHEN CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE FOR THE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF YOUNG SEEDLINGS. THE REPRODUCTION AND REGENERATION OF TROPICAL FORESTS ARE THEREFORE VULNERABLE TO A CHANGING CLIMATE. THIS PROJECT, RENEWED FOR FIVE MORE YEARS, USES LONG-TERM DATA TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE TIMING AND SUCCESS OF REPRODUCTION IN TROPICAL PLANTS VARIES YEAR-TO-YEAR AS THE CUES AND CONDITIONS FOR FLOWERING, FRUITING, AND SEEDLING SURVIVAL VARY DUE TO WITHIN-YEAR SEASONALITY, MULTI-YEAR CLIMATE CYCLES SUCH AS EL NI?O, AND/OR THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

HOWEVER, THESE VARIATIONS OR MUTATIONS ARE NOT EVENLY DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE GENOME. VARIATION IS HIGHEST WHERE REGULATORY PROTEINS BIND TO DNA, A PROCESS THAT IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE CHANGES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HUMAN BIOLOGY. THIS PROJECT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER GENOMIC VARIATION IS INCREASED BECAUSE PROTEIN BINDING MAKES DNA MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY MUTATIONS, OR BECAUSE PROTEINS BLOCK REPAIR OF DAMAGED DNA LEADING TO MUTATIONS. ASSESSING THESE POSSIBILITIES REQUIRES DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE METHODS. THIS PROJECT WILL NOT ONLY ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER PROTEINS MAKE DNA MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE OR HARDER TO REPAIR, BUT THE NEWLY DEVELOPED METHODS WILL BE A MAJOR LEAP FORWARD IN QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF DNA DAMAGE. TO ENSURE THE BROADER IMPACT OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED METHODS, INVESTIGATORS WILL REACH OUT TO THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF SCIENTISTS IN TWO WAYS. A WORKSHOP ENTITLED ?WHAT IS DAMAGING MY DNA?

THESE ARE PROTEIN MISFOLDING DISEASES IN WHICH THE COMBINATION OF ENVIRONMENT, STRESS, AND AGING TRIGGER THE CONVERSION OF NORMAL PROTEINS INTO NON-FUNCTIONAL AND DELETERIOUS AGGREGATES KNOWN AS AMYLOIDS WHOSE ACCUMULATION OVER TIME LEADS TO NEURONAL DEATH. ONE OVERLOOKED BUT CRITICAL CHALLENGE FOR TREATING TOXIC AGGREGATES IS THAT PROTEIN AGGREGATION IS ALSO ADAPTIVE, SERVING VITAL BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS SUCH AS LONG-TERM MEMORY, STORAGE OF PEPTIDE HORMONES, AND MELANIN POLYMERIZATION IN ANIMALS. IT IS NOW ALSO CLEAR THAT PROTEIN AGGREGATES ARE WIDESPREAD IN NORMAL ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR MIS-REGULATION UPON INTRODUCING NON-NATIVE PROTEINS CAPABLE OF DISENTANGLING AGGREGATES RESULTS IN DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE PRESENCE AND ROLE OF AMYLOID AGGREGATES DURING EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND TO INVESTIGATE THEIR REGULATION BY A NOVEL CLASS OF CHAPERONES WHICH MAY BE KEY TO AGGREGATE PROCESSING DURING ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT. UNDERSTANDING THE REGULATION OF DEVELOPMENTALLY IMPORTANT AGGREGATES WILL LEAD TO INSIGHTS INTO AGGREGATE-BASED PATHOLOGIES AND NOVEL DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANISTIC STRATEGIES UTILIZING FUNCTIONAL PROTEIN AGGREGATES TO REGULATE CELL FATE SPECIFICATION.

THE PIS RECENTLY IDENTIFIED MULTIPLE SPECIFIC AMYLOID BODIES DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ANIMAL AGGREGATES ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EARLY DEVELOPMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE PRESENCE AND ROLE OF AMYLOID AGGREGATES DURING EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND TO INVESTIGATE THEIR REGULATION BY THE ABCF PROTEINS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED TO AFFECT AGGREGATION REPORTERS AND NATIVE PRIONS IN YEAST, RESOLUBILIZATION OF DENATURED PROTEINS IN VITRO, AND AMYLOID PROCESSING DURING ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT. THE FINDING THAT AMYLOID AGGREGATES ARE WIDESPREAD IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT PROMPTED A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT AND INVESTIGATING AMYLOID AGGREGATES IN DEVELOPMENT. THIS PROPOSAL CAPITALIZES ON THE COMPLEMENTARY AND SYNERGISTIC EXPERIMENTAL ADVANTAGES OF C. ELEGANS AND S. CEREVISIAE TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ABCF PROTEINS ARE NOVEL, WELL-CONSERVED AND HERETOFORE UNDERAPPRECIATED DISAGGREGASES THAT REGULATE PROTEOSTASIS IN YEAST AND MEMBRANE-LESS ORGANELLE FORMATION IN ANIMALS, THEREBY CONTROLLING THE SOLUBLE, FUNCTIONAL PROTEOME IN A CELL FATE-SPECIFIC MANNER. AIM 1 TESTS THE ROLE OF ABCF GENES IN TISSUE AND CELL TYPE SPECIFICITY OF AGGREGATION DURING ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT. AIM 2 CHARACTERIZES THE ROLE OF ABCF IN REGULATING RNA PROCESSING (P) BODY CONSTITUENT AGGREGATION IN WORMS AND YEAST, AND AIM 3 DETERMINES THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF ABCF PROTEINS AS CHAPERONES. TOGETHER, THESE AIMS DESCRIBE A COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF HOW AMYLOIDS AND THEIR DEDICATED DISAGGREGASES SERVE AS NOVEL REGULATORS OF KEY EVENTS IN EARLY ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING STORAGE, PROPAGATION, AND DISTRIBUTION OF MATERNAL AND ZYGOTICALLY SYNTHESIZED PROTEINS THAT CAN BE RELEASED AS REQUIRED.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL RESEARCH ADMINISTRATOR JOB CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM APPLICABLE TO THE WIDE ARRAY OF ADMINISTRATIVE ROLES THAT SUPPORT SPONSORED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. A NATIONAL JOB CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM IS NEEDED TO EXTEND ACCESS TO RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT ACROSS DISCIPLINES AND ADDRESS WORKFORCE CHALLENGES AT ALL INSTITUTIONS, ESPECIALLY EMERGING AND MINORITY-SERVING INSTITUTIONS. THE LACK OF A FORMAL, NATIONAL JOB CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM NEGATIVELY AFFECTS EMPLOYEE RETENTION. THIS RETENTION PROBLEM RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSS AND DIMINISHED PRODUCTIVITY.

PLAYING A CENTRAL ROLE IN THOSE SYSTEMS, MOST OF THE CLASSIC STUDIES ON GRAPHS ARE BASED ON THE TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF STATIC GRAPHS (GRAPHS THAT DO NOT CHANGE OVER TIME). THE EXISTING WORKS ON DYNAMIC GRAPHS SHOW ONLY LIMITED SCALABILITY FOR LARGE-SCALE PRACTICAL DATASETS. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH AIMS AT DESIGNING FAST, SCALABLE METHODS FOR REVEALING DYNAMIC BEHAVIORS OF A SOCIO-TECHNICAL SYSTEM BY DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE ALGORITHMIC AND COMPUTING TECHNIQUES.

THIS MCA AWARD PARTNERS FACULTY AND STUDENTS AT MARSHALL UNIVERSITY IN WEST VIRGINIA (EPSCOR STATE) WITH FACULTY AT OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCED IN POPULATION GENOMICS AND MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS. THIS PARTNERSHIP WILL ENABLE TRAINING IN THE APPLICATION OF CUTTING-EDGE GENOMIC TOOLS IN THE STUDY OF SPECIES DELIMITATION, SPECIATION, POPULATION GENETICS, ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION, AND BIOGEOGRAPHY. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL PRODUCE AND ANALYZE GENOME-SCALE AND WHOLE GENOME DATASETS FOR THREE CODISTRIBUTED AVIAN GROUPS IN EAST ASIA ? THE YELLOW-BREASTED FLYCATCHER COMPLEX, THE VARIED TIT COMPLEX, AND THE ASIATIC WHITE-EYES. GENOMIC DATA APPLIED TO THESE GROUPS WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF DIFFERENT SPECIES DELIMITATION METHODS, THE INFLUENCE OF ISLAND GEOGRAPHY ON POPULATION PARAMETERS, AND THE IMPACT OF ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION ON THE GENOME.

THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY ON THE MOVEMENT AND BIOACCUMULATION OF HG IN MARINE ECOSYSTEMS IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD. SUCH UNDERSTANDING IS VITAL TO SETTING TARGETS AND ASSESSING THE PROGRESS OF POLICY EFFORTS TO LIMIT HG CONTAMINATION OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND HUMAN EXPOSURE. THIS RESEARCH SEEKS TO DEVELOP AN APPROXIMATELY 1000-YEAR RECORD OF HG PRESERVED IN CLAM SHELLS COLLECTED FROM THE GULF OF MAINE, ONE OF THE MOST RAPIDLY WARMING REGIONS OF THE WORLD?S OCEANS. LIKE TREE RINGS, CLAM SHELLS POSSESS LAYERS THAT CAN BE PRECISELY DATED AND HAVE POTENTIAL TO PRESERVE HIGHLY RESOLVED SIGNALS OF PAST VARIATION IN HG CONCENTRATIONS AND ACCUMULATION BY BIOTA. IMPORTANTLY, THIS HG RECORD CAN BE PAIRED WITH OTHER KINDS OF CLIMATE PROXY INFORMATION PRESERVED IN THE CLAM SHELLS, GIVING DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MARINE HG IN THIS ORGANISM CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING CLIMATE. THIS RECORD WILL PROVIDE AN ESPECIALLY USEFUL DATASET FOR CALIBRATING AND IMPROVING MODELS FOR PREDICTING THE EFFECTS OF POLICY AND CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE RECOVERY OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS FROM CENTURIES OF HG POLLUTION.

SOME OF THESE BACTERIA ARE BENEFICIAL AND SOME ARE PATHOGENIC (CAUSE DISEASE) TO THE PLANTS. PLANTS CANNOT MOVE AS MUCH AS HUMANS, HOWEVER, SO PATHOGENIC BACTERIA CAN SOMETIMES ACCUMULATE AROUND MATURE PLANTS AND THIS MIGHT BE DETRIMENTAL TO YOUNG SEEDLINGS. IN ADDITION, THERE MIGHT BE ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS, LIKE AIR TEMPERATURE OR SALINITY, THAT CHANGE HOW THE PATHOGENS BUILD UP. THIS PROJECT EXPLORES THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN PLANT-PATHOGEN ACCUMULATION AND SALINITY GRADIENTS, USING TWO FRESHWATER SWAMP TREE SPECIES THAT ACT AS A STORM BARRIER ALONG THE GULF OF MEXICO AND ATLANTIC COASTS. WE WILL TEST HYPOTHESES ABOUT PLANT PATHOGENS AND SALINITY, AND WE WILL ADD BENEFICIAL BACTERIA TO PLANTS THAT ARE GROWING IN AN ALTERNATIVE SUBSTRATE, CRUSHED GLASS FROM RECYCLE CENTERS, FOR COASTAL RESTORATION. BROADER IMPACTS INCLUDE ENGAGING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND PROVIDING DATA TO A LOCAL START-UP FOR GLASS RECYCLING. NEGATIVE FEEDBACK OCCURS WHEN MICROORGANISMS IN THE SOIL ACCUMULATE AROUND A MATURE TREE AND PROVIDE A NEGATIVE GROWTH ENVIRONMENT FOR YOUNG SEEDLINGS OF THE SAME SPECIES. THIS PHENOMENON HAS BEEN SHOWN ACROSS MANY KINDS OF HABITATS, BUT MUCH LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW INCREASED STRESS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTS WITH NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP IS A PROBLEM AS CLIMATE-RELATED STRESSORS ARE INCREASING IN MANY HABITATS. WE ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP IN THE CONTEXT OF SEA LEVEL RISE AND HURRICANE INTENSITY, USING FRESHWATER SWAMP TREES AS OUR FOCAL SPECIES. BROADLY WE ASK: WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND INCREASING SALINITY STRESS? THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF BOTH FACILITATION OR INTERFERENCE IN OUR STUDY SYSTEM OF PLANT-SYMBIONT INTERACTIONS, AND THESE OUTCOMES MAY CHANGE WITH STRESS. TWO GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENTS WILL TEST THE EFFECTS OF NEGATIVE DENSITY DEPENDENCE ALONG A SALINITY GRADIENT AND IN CRUSHED, RECYCLED GLASS. WE PREDICT THAT SEEDLINGS WILL BENEFIT FROM GROWING IN HETEROSPECIFIC SOIL WHEN STRESS IS LOW BUT WILL BENEFIT FROM GROWING IN CONSPECIFIC SOIL WHEN STRESS IS HIGH. BECAUSE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK IS OBSERVED IN SO MANY HABITATS, OUR RESEARCH FINDINGS MAY HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES RELATED TO STRESS.

THE RESEARCH ADDRESSES THE INCREASE IN SEA LEVEL AND COASTAL FLOODING, THAT IS AFFECTING MAINE?S COASTAL COMMUNITIES, TO ENHANCE THEIR RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. NEAR AND LONG-TERM FLOOD PROJECTIONS, THAT COMBINE LOCAL OBSERVATIONS OF WATER LEVEL AND FLOOD IMPACTS, ARE CRITICAL TO COMMUNITIES? ABILITIES TO ADAPT TO THE NEW CLIMATE AND SEA LEVEL REALITY. NATIONALLY, SEA LEVEL RISE ADAPTATION-RESEARCH COMMONLY FOCUSES ON URBAN CENTERS WHERE THE GREATEST LOSSES IN PROPERTY VALUE OCCUR. RURAL COASTAL COMMUNITIES, HOWEVER, FACE UNIQUE ADAPTATION CHALLENGES DUE TO THEIR REMOTENESS, ISOLATION FROM CENTRAL PLANNING AGENCIES, LIMITED RESOURCES, AND INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY. ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS BUREAU, MAINE IS THE MOST RURAL STATE IN THE US WITH ONLY 11% OF ITS MUNICIPALITIES HAVING A TOWN PLANNER. THE ABSENCE OF A LOCAL PLANNER OR INSUFFICIENT TO NO REGIONAL PLANNING SUPPORT AFFECTS 72% OF THESE COMMUNITIES. TO HELP THESE COMMUNITIES, THE GULF OF MAINE RESEARCH INSTITUTE LEADS A TEAM OF CIVIC, COMMUNITY, EDUCATION, AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS IN CO-DESIGNING AND BUILDING SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO EXPAND THE COLLECTION OF LOCAL TIDAL FLOODING DATA AND LEVERAGE IT TO BUILD RESILIENCE IN SMALL AND RURAL MAINE COASTAL COMMUNITIES. PARTNERS INCLUDE FOUR COASTAL MAINE COMMUNITIES WHERE LOW-COST TIDE GAUGES WILL BE INSTALLED TO COLLECT LOCAL WATER LEVELS IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO SUPPORT LOCAL CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TO RUN AND SUSTAIN A COMMUNITY SCIENCE PROGRAM THAT COLLECTS GEO- AND TIME-REFERENCED OBSERVATIONS OF LOCAL FLOOD EVENTS AND IMPACTS, DEVELOP DATA PRODUCTS FOR USE BY THE COMMUNITY, AND PROVIDE MINI-GRANTS TO LEVERAGE THE NEW DATA TO SUPPORT ONGOING FLOOD RESILIENCE PROJECTS. AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THE WORK IS THE ENGAGEMENT OF LOCAL YOUTH BY PILOTING A THREE-PART CURRICULUM THAT INCLUDES PARTICIPATION IN THE COMMUNITY SCIENCE PROGRAM AND WORKING WITH LOCAL MUNICIPAL LEADERS ON CLIMATE ADAPTATION. LOCALIZED AND CO-DEVELOPED DATA SUPPORTING COASTAL FLOOD RESILIENCE WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO MULTI-DIMENSIONAL, MULTI-SECTOR, CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLANNING ISSUES FACED BY A BROAD ARRAY OF COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INVOLVE AND TRAIN A FEMALE POSTDOC AND TWO EARLY-CAREER PROJECT STAFF, CONTRIBUTING TO A NEW GENERATION OF RESILIENCE RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS WHO CAN WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH CIVIC LEADERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THE CIVIC INNOVATION CHALLENGE IS A COLLABORATION WITH DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, AND THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION. SEA LEVEL RISE HAS CREATED A SITUATION OF ROUTINE FLOODING IN MANY OF MAINE?S COASTAL COMMUNITIES. SUCH FLOOD PROJECTIONS THAT COMBINE LOCAL OBSERVATIONS OF WATER LEVEL AND FLOOD IMPACTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR COMMUNITIES TO ADAPT TO THIS NEW REALITY. MAINE FACES SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO BUILDING COASTAL FLOOD RESILIENCE DUE TO SPARSE TIDE GAUGE COVERAGE COMBINED WITH OBSERVATION-BASED FLOOD THRESHOLDS AND THE ABSENCE OF A NETWORK OF RESEARCHERS, CIVIC LEADERS, ENGAGED COMMUNITY MEMBERS (PARTICULARLY YOUTH), AND RESILIENCE PRACTITIONERS READY TO LEVERAGE SUCH DATA TO SUPPORT COASTAL PLANNING AND RESILIENCE. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, THE GULF OF MAINE RESEARCH INSTITUTE HAS ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF CIVIC, COMMUNITY, EDUCATION, AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS TO CREATE SOCIAL AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXPANDS CRITICAL COASTAL FLOODING DATA AND LEVERAGES IT TO HELP WITH COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. THE PILOT PROJECT WILL BE INITIATED IN FOUR COASTAL MAINE COMMUNITIES (PORTLAND, BOOTHBAY HARBOR, ST. GEORGE, AND MACHIAS) THAT ARE EXPERIENCING REGULAR FLOODING AND THAT HAVE A RANGE OF DEMOGRAPHICS AND MUNICIPAL CAPACITIES. RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE: WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL LOCATION FOR TIDE GAUGES SO THEY CAN INFORM RESILIENCE PLANNING AT THE MUNICIPAL SCALE? CAN A WELL-STRUCTURED COMMUNITY SCIENCE PROGRAM YIELD DATA THAT SUPPORTS RESILIENCE ACTIVITIES AND CATALYZES COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUTH, TO DRIVE FLOOD ADAPTATION? PROJECT SUCCESS RELIES ON PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP LOCAL CAPACITY FOR RUNNING AND SUSTAINING COASTAL FLOODING COMMUNITY SCIENCE PROGRAMS THAT COLLECT GEO- AND TIME-REFERENCED FLOOD IMPACT DATA. THIS IS DONE BY WORKING WITH YOUTH AND CREATING A THREE-PART SCIENCE CURRICULUM WITH MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO WILL PILOT IT IN THEIR CLASSES. GOALS ARE TO DEVELOP STUDENTS' CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCIENCE AND PHYSICAL DRIVERS OF COASTAL FLOODING, HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE IN COLLECTING AND CONTRIBUTING DATA TO THE COASTAL FLOODING COMMUNITY SCIENCE PROGRAM, AND SUPPORT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A FACILITATED COASTAL RESILIENCE LEARNING EXERCISE ALONGSIDE ADULT COMMUNITY MEMBER MENTORS. THE SCIENCE TEAM WILL USE DATA AND INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THIS APPROACH TO DEVELOP AND PROVIDE CUSTOMIZED DATA PRODUCTS. IT WILL ALSO ISSUE COMMUNITY MINI-GRANTS THAT SUPPORT ONGOING FLOOD RESILIENCE PROJECTS IN EACH TARGETED COMMUNITY.

IN TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) MOFS, ELECTRONIC CONDUCTION CAN OCCUR WITHIN THE PLANES THROUGH COORDINATION AND CONJUGATED PI-BONDS AND/OR ACROSS THE PLANES THROUGH PI-STACKED LAYERS, WHEREAS IN 2D COFS, THE LATTER REPRESENT THE PRIMARY TRANSPORT PATHWAYS. THE LARGE DISPARITIES BETWEEN IN-PLANE AND OUT-OF-PLANE CHARGE TRANSPORT IN TWO ORTHOGONAL DIRECTIONS OFTEN RENDER THE CONDUCTIVITY OF THESE MATERIALS HIGHLY ANISOTROPIC (I.E., DIRECTION DEPENDENT) AND DAMPEN THEIR OVERALL BULK CONDUCTIVITY. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTE BOTH IN- AND OUT-OF-PLANE CHARGE TRANSPORT SUCH THAT IT LEADS TO HIGHER BULK CONDUCTIVITY IN 2D MOFS AND COFS, IN THIS PROJECT SUPPORTED BY NSF'S SOLID STATE AND MATERIALS CHEMISTRY (SSMC) PROGRAM, PROF.

THE ASSOCIATIONS OR INTERACTIONS MICROBES HAVE WITH THEIR HOSTS MAY RANGE FROM BENEFICIAL TO DETRIMENTAL, AND MAY BE DIRECT OR INDIRECT. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THAT THERE ARE TRILLIONS OF MICROORGANISMS ON EARTH, MUCH OF THAT DIVERSITY AND THEIR INTERACTIONS ARE UNKNOWN. A POORLY STUDIED GROUP ARE VIRUSES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO BEGIN TO DISCOVER THE DIVERSITY OF VIRUSES THAT INHABIT FUNGI (A.K.A. MYCOVIRUSES) THAT LIVE INSIDE PLANTS, THE EFFECTS OF MYCOVIRUSES ON THOSE FUNGI, AND THE INDIRECT INTERACTIONS AND CONSEQUENCES ON THE PLANT HOSTS. ONE HYPOTHESIS OF THIS STUDY IS THAT MYCOVIRUSES SERVE AS AN ?INVISIBILITY CLOAK?, SO THAT FUNGUS CAN PENETRATE THE PLANT WITHOUT ACTIVATING THE PLANT DEFENSES. THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON BENEFICIAL AND PATHOGENIC FUNGI THAT INHABIT COFFEE PLANTS. WHILE SOME MYCOVIRUSES MAY MAKE A FUNGUS MORE PATHOGENIC ON ITS PLANT HOST, OTHERS MAY MAKE THEM LESS PATHOGENIC (=HYPOVIRULENT MYCOVIRUSES), THUS HAVING POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN THE ENGINEERING OF THOSE FUNGI TO BENEFIT CROPS. FOR EXAMPLE, INOCULATING HYPOVIRULENT MYCOVIRUSES INTO A PLANT PATHOGENIC FUNGUS TO MAKE IT NON-PATHOGENIC, OR, ON THE OTHER HAND, INOCULATING A BENEFICIAL FUNGUS SO THAT IT CAN COLONIZE AN WHOLE PLANT AND PROVIDE A BROAD AND INNATE PROTECTION AGAINST DISEASES OR THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE (E.G., DROUGHT OR HIGH TEMPERATURES). THE PROJECT WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH OF BOWIE STATE UNIVERSITY?S RESEARCH AGENDA AND THE TRAINING OF STUDENTS AT THE FIRST HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE/UNIVERSITY (HBCU) IN MARYLAND. THE PROJECT WILL STUDY THE DIVERSITY OF MYCOVIRUSES (VIRUSES OF FUNGI) AND THEIR EFFECTS ON ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI, THE PLANT HOSTS, AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE TRIPARTITE SYMBIOSIS (VIRUS-FUNGUS-PLANT). THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT ARE TO ASSESS THE DIVERSITY OF MYCOVIRUSES IN A SELECTED COLLECTION OF FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES FROM WILD RUBIACEAE (THE COFFEE FAMILY); DETERMINE IF THERE IS A PHYLOGENETIC AND MYCOVIRUS-INCIDENCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PLANT, HOST FUNGUS, AND THE MYCOVIRUS; AND COMPARE, IN VITRO AND IN PLANTA, THE EFFECTS OF MYCOVIRUS-INFECTED AND MYCOVIRUS-FREE ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI. THE OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY COLLECTING AND IDENTIFYING THE FUNGI ASSOCIATED TO WILD RUBIACEAE PLANTS IN COSTA RICA, SCREENING THEM FOR MYCOVIRUSES USING TRADITIONAL AND METAGENOMIC/METATRANSCRIPTOMIC APPROACHES, ERADICATING THE MYCOVIRUSES FROM THE FUNGI, AND ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF MYCOVIRUS ERADICATION ON THE PHENOTYPE OF THE FUNGUS (I.E., FUNGAL GROWTH RATE IN VITRO, ANTAGONISTIC ABILITY IN VITRO, AND IN PLANTA CAPACITY TO INFECT AND BECOME ENDOPHYTIC).

MORE THAN 90 SMALL EARTHQUAKES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THIS REGION SINCE THEN, WITH THE LARGEST MAGNITUDE OF 3.6 OCCURRING ON JUNE 29, 2022. THESE EARTHQUAKES HAVE CONTINUED UNTIL AT LEAST SUMMER OF 2023, MAKING THIS HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR THE REGION. THIS SWARM HAS HAD NO CLEAR MAIN SHOCK AND HAS NO OBVIOUS TECTONIC OR ANTHROPOGENIC CAUSES. SO FAR, STANDARD EARTHQUAKE LOCATIONS DO NOT REVEAL A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRE-EXISTING EASTERN PIEDMONT FAULT SYSTEM. THIS PROJECT WILL ANALYZE SEISMIC DATA FROM A SET OF INSTRUMENTS DEPLOYED BY THE RESEARCHERS IN OCTOBER 2022 TO BETTER IMAGE THE FAULT STRUCTURE HOSTING THE SWARM AND THE UNDERLYING DRIVING FORCE. THIS PROJECT WILL NATURALLY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH THE IMPACTED COMMUNITY IN ELGIN-LUGOFF, AND THE BROADER MIDLANDS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, WHERE MANY RESIDENTS HAVE FELT EARTHQUAKES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES. THIS PROJECT ALSO PROVIDES INCLUSION AND STEM WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, BY FUNDING RESEARCH BY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM THE LOCAL SOUTH CAROLINA COMMUNITY TO PERFORM RESEARCH IN THEIR OWN STATE. STUDENTS ON THIS GRANT WILL PARTICIPATE IN OUTREACH TO BUILD STEM LITERACY THROUGH KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AND FURTHER BROADEN PARTICIPATION IN GEOSCIENCE. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING TO SUPPORT SUMMER INTERNSHIPS AT BOTH INSTITUTIONS. IN OCTOBER 2022, 85 SEISMIC NODES WERE DEPLOYED FOR 4 MONTHS BY THE RESEARCH TEAM OVER THE ELGIN-LUGOFF SWARM TO RECORD FURTHER EARTHQUAKES. THESE INSTRUMENTS WERE COMPLEMENTED BY ONE BROADBAND STATION AND ONE NEARBY STRONG MOTION STATION OPERATED BY THE SOUTH CAROLINA SEISMIC NETWORK. THE RICH DATASET CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL SMALLER EARTHQUAKES, WHICH WILL BETTER IMAGE FAULT STRUCTURES HOSTING THIS SWARM SEQUENCE AND ELUCIDATE THE DRIVING FORCES. THE WORK WILL ATTEMPT TO REVEAL SMALL EARTHQUAKES DURING THE NODAL DEPLOYMENT PERIOD, BELOW THE DETECTION THRESHOLD BEFORE THIS DEPLOYMENT, BY USING BOTH MACHINE LEARNING AND TEMPLATE MATCHING TECHNIQUES. THE TEAM WILL THEN RELOCATE THESE NEWLY DETECTED EVENTS WITH WAVEFORM-BASED TECHNIQUES, FOLLOWED BY FOCAL MECHANISM DETERMINATIONS. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO CONSTRUCT A NEW MODEL OF THE SEISMIC VELOCITIES BENEATH ELGIN. USING BOTH THE MORE COMPLETE CATALOG AND THE IMPROVED VELOCITY MODEL, THE EARTHQUAKES EARLIER IN THIS SWARM CAN BE RELOCATED RELATIVE TO THE LATER ONES THUS IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF THE WHOLE CATALOGUE.

THE ABILITY TO PREDICT WHETHER A SEGMENT WILL TRANSFORM INTO AN OXBOW HOLDS SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE, GIVEN THAT THESE LAKES SERVE AS REPOSITORIES FOR POLLUTANTS AND PROVIDE UNIQUE HABITATS. DURING THE INITIAL STAGES FOLLOWING CUTOFF, THE GEOMETRY OF THE CONNECTION IS DECISIVE IN DETERMINING HOW OXBOW EVOLUTION PLAYS OUT. NOTABLY, CUTOFFS WITH HIGH-ANGLE JUNCTIONS TEND TO ACCUMULATE SEDIMENT AT THE ENTRANCE, INITIATING OXBOW FORMATION. TO EVALUATE THE IDEA THAT THE INITIAL CUTOFF GEOMETRY DETERMINES THE LIKELIHOOD OF OXBOW FORMATION, THE RESEARCHERS WILL UNDERTAKE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF RECENT CUTOFFS IN THE WEST FORK WHITE RIVER (INDIANA, USA). THEY WILL EMPLOY BOTH FIELD DATA COLLECTION AND NUMERICAL MODELING METHODOLOGIES. FURTHERMORE, COLLABORATION WITH THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT WILL ENABLE ESTIMATES OF POLLUTANT STORAGE WITHIN OXBOWS. ADDITIONALLY, PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE INDY WATER CONNECTION CAMP AND THE WILLIAMS SUMMER SCIENCE PROGRAM WILL FACILITATE EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL STUDENTS. ONCE A MEANDER CUTOFF OCCURS, IT ESTABLISHES A BIFURCATION WITH THE PRIMARY RIVER CHANNEL. THE STABILITY OF THIS BIFURCATION DETERMINES WHETHER IT ULTIMATELY TRANSFORMS INTO AN OXBOW LAKE.

THESE WELL-ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS GUARANTEE PARTICIPATION OF AT LEAST TWO (TYPICALLY MORE) XAVIER UNIVERSITY STUDENTS EVERY YEAR IN RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT UTILIZE THE XPS. MORE BROADLY, INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH EQUIPMENT THROUGH THIS PROGRAM IS CRITICAL FOR BUILDING (NOT SIMPLY MAINTAINING) RESEARCH CAPACITY AND FOR ATTRACTING (AND RETAINING) SCIENTIFIC TALENT IN REGIONS LIKE THE GREATER NEW ORLEANS AREA. TECHNICAL SUMMARY X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY (XPS) IS A SURFACE-SENSITIVE TECHNIQUE USED TO CHARACTERIZE COMPOSITION AND CHEMISTRY (E.G., OXIDATION STATE OF ELEMENTS) OF MATERIAL SURFACES. BECAUSE SURFACE CHEMISTRY PLAYS A PIVOTAL ROLE IN MATERIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERFORMANCE, PARTICULARLY FOR NANOMATERIALS AND SURFACE-ACTIVE MATERIALS, ACCESS TO STATE-OF-THE-ART XPS CAPABILITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH. THIS GRANT SUPPORTS THE ACQUISITION OF AN XPS INSTRUMENT TO BE HOUSED IN THE COORDINATED INSTRUMENTATION FACILITY (CIF) AT TULANE UNIVERSITY IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA. EQUIPMENT IN THE TULANE CIF SERVES THE NEEDS OF GREATER NEW ORLEANS AREA BUSINESSES AND FOUR MAJOR UNIVERSITIES: TULANE UNIVERSITY (PRIVATE, RESEARCH-INTENSIVE); THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS (PUBLIC, RESEARCH-INTENSIVE); XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA (XULA) (PRIVATE, HBCU, UNDERGRADUATE-FOCUSED); AND DILLARD UNIVERSITY (PRIVATE, HBCU, UNDERGRADUATE-FOCUSED). THE ACQUISITION OF A NEW XPS INSTRUMENT BRINGS TO THIS REGION MODERN CAPABILITIES NEEDED TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF MATERIALS SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS AND TO ENCOURAGE GREATER INDUSTRY-UNIVERSITY COLLABORATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE NEW INSTRUMENT IS EQUIPPED WITH THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL FEATURES: IMAGING, VARIABLE ANGLE MEASUREMENTS, DEPTH PROFILING, IN-SITU HEATING/COOLING, AND ELECTRICAL CONTACTS FOR IN-SITU SAMPLE BIASING OR CURRENT FLOW THROUGH THE SAMPLE. THESE FEATURES SUPPORT ONGOING RESEARCH OF MATERIAL INTERFACES IMPORTANT IN BOTH TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING AREAS, INCLUDING POLYMER ENGINEERING, SOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION, CATALYSIS, NANOTECHNOLOGY, ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY STORAGE, AND OPTOELECTRONICS.

TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, THIS PROPOSAL COMPARES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN AVIAN INFLUENZA VIRUS AND NATURAL DUCK HOSTS WHO USUALLY REMAIN ASYMPTOMATIC FOLLOWING INFECTION, VERSUS INFECTION WITH ACCIDENTAL POULTRY HOSTS, WHO PRESENT WITH SEVERE SYMPTOMS. THIS PROPOSAL IS A HIGHLY INTEGRATED INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION BETWEEN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTS, VIROLOGISTS, AND VETERINARY PATHOLOGISTS. THIS TEAM WILL USE A STATE-OF-THE-ART SPATIAL METABOLOMICS APPROACH TO MAP THE METABOLIC CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH INFECTION ACROSS PERMISSIVE AND NON-PERMISSIVE TISSUES OF THESE HOSTS, THEIR TRAJECTORIES OVER INFECTION AND RECOVERY, AND THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH EMERGENCE OF NEW VIRUS SEQUENCES.

INFECTION IN NATURAL RESERVOIR HOSTS MAY LEAD TO SUBCLINICAL OR MILD DISEASE, WHILE INFECTION OF OTHER ?ACCIDENTAL? HOSTS WILL LEAD TO SEVERE ILLNESS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THIS CRITICAL GAP IN INFECTION BIOLOGY, USING NATURAL VS ACCIDENTAL HOST OF AVIAN INFLUENZA VIRUS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED IS THAT TISSUES WILL PRESENT MINOR METABOLIC CHANGES AND A METABOLIC TRAJECTORY TOWARDS RECOVERY IN NATURAL HOSTS, WHILE METABOLIC ALTERATIONS WILL BE MORE SEVERE AND PERSISTENT IN ACCIDENTAL HOSTS. WE ALSO HYPOTHESIZE THAT DIFFERENTIAL METABOLITE AVAILABILITY BETWEEN TISSUES AND ACCIDENTAL VS NATURAL HOSTS PROVIDES AN ENVIRONMENT FOR THE SELECTION OF MORE VIRULENT STRAINS IN ACCIDENTAL HOSTS.

THESE DATA CAN BE USED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SPREAD OF INFORMATION AND INDIVIDUAL WELL-BEING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS PROJECT CREATES A DATA VISUALIZATION TOOL TO PROCESS SOCIAL MEDIA DATA FROM COPE-ID. THIS TOOL MAKES IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO EXPLORE LARGE VOLUMES OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA TO STUDY THE EMOTIONS, THOUGHTS, BEHAVIORS, AND HEALTH OF PEOPLE DURING A PANDEMIC OR RELATED DISASTER. THE VISUALIZATION TOOL ALLOWS RESEARCHERS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AND SKILL LEVELS TO ACCESS AND PROCESS DATA FROM THE COPE-ID, AS WELL AS DATA FROM OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA SOURCES. IMPROVING ACCESS TO COPE-ID DATA CAN INFORM FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES AND INTERVENTIONS. THE DATA VISUALIZATION TOOL?S USERS WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS AN OVERVIEW OF LARGE SOCIAL MEDIA DATASETS THROUGH A PLATFORM DASHBOARD. THE DASHBOARD PRESENTS VISUALIZATIONS OF THE DATA THAT ARE CONSTRUCTED BY TOPIC MODELING ALGORITHMS, WHICH PRODUCE A SUMMARY OF THE DATA IN THE FORM OF WORD AND TOPIC FREQUENCIES. THE TOOL ALSO ALLOWS USERS TO PERFORM SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, SUCH AS THE ATTITUDE TOWARD TOPICS FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE. VISUALIZATIONS SUCH AS WORD CLOUDS AND TIME SERIES CHARTS GENERATE INSIGHTS FOR USERS TO DRIVE THEIR TASK-BASED INTERACTIONS WITH THE TOOL. USERS CAN ALSO REQUEST SAMPLES OF DATA THAT CAN BE LABELED USING QUALITATIVE OR CONTENT ANALYSIS. THIS LABELED DATA CAN THEN BE USED TO MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS, PREDICTIONS THAT ARE GENERATED BY ADVANCED STATISTICAL ANALYSES OR MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. TRAINING DATASETS CAN BE USED TO CODE AND PROCESS COPE-ID DATA, AND THESE CODED DATASETS CAN BE USED TO EXAMINE THE RATE OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN CODERS SO THAT THE QUALITY OF THE DATA CAN BE IMPROVED. THE TOOL IMPROVES SCIENTISTS' ACCESS TO SOCIAL MEDIA DATA AND ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO TEST THEORIES OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR USING USER GENERATED BIG DATA.

THE CONCEPTS OF RISK, VULNERABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON INDIVIDUALS? LIVES AND WELL-BEING. HOWEVER, ADVANCING SCIENCE-BASED RESILIENCE RESEARCH IS HARD BECAUSE THE DATA THAT ARE USED TO MEASURE DISASTER RESILIENCE COME FROM MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES AND ARE DIFFICULT TO MERGE. EVEN FOR AVAILABLE DATA THERE ARE FEW TOOLS AVAILABLE TO ANALYZE THEM, ESPECIALLY FOR RESEARCHERS WHO DO NOT HAVE EXTENSIVE QUANTITATIVE TRAINING. THIS PROJECT OVERCOMES THESE DIFFICULTIES BY DEVELOPING A NATIONAL CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE CALLED THE HUMAN DYNAMICS AND RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CONTAINS LARGE-SCALE DATA AND ANALYTIC TOOLS TO SUPPORT AND ADVANCE HUMAN DYNAMICS AND RESILIENCE RESEARCH. KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM VISUALIZING AND ANALYZING THE DATA USING THE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BETTER INFORM POLICIES TO INCREASE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. THE PROJECT ACCOMPLISHES FOUR OBJECTIVES. FIRST, IT DEVELOPS FOUR NEW DATABASES CONTAINING INTEGRATED DATA FROM AROUND THE NATION, INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA AND CELL-PHONE MOBILITY DATA. SECOND, IT CONSTRUCTS VISUALIZATION AND ANALYTICAL TOOLS, SUCH AS MAPS, STATISTICS, AND DYNAMIC MODELING AND SIMULATIONS TO FACILITATE BOTH EXPLORATORY AND IN-DEPTH RESEARCH. THIRD, IT IMPLEMENTS A TRAINING AND FEEDBACK MODULE TO HELP ENGAGE RESEARCHERS, PRACTITIONERS, AND THE PUBLIC TO EXPLORE AND CONDUCT ANALYSES THAT SHOULD LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF RESILIENCE.

BUT HOW DOES MAGMATISM CREATE AND ALTER THE CONTINENTS AT GREAT INVISIBLE DEPTHS? EARTH SCIENTISTS HAVE LONG INFERRED THAT MAFIC MAGMAS RISE FROM THE MANTLE AND POND NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE CRUST IN A PROCESS CALLED ?UNDERPLATING?. THIS PROCESS PRODUCES ?HOT ZONES? IN THE DEEP CONTINENTAL CRUST WHICH LEAD TO MELTING, MAGMA GENERATION, AND MAGMA MIXING. FEW LOCALITIES EXIST ON EARTH WHERE HOT ZONES HAVE BEEN UPLIFTED AND EXPOSED AT THE SURFACE FOR DIRECT OBSERVATION. THIS PROJECT EXPLORES THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION OF MAGMA IN AN ANCIENT HOT ZONE OF UNDERPLATING, NOW EXPOSED AT THE SURFACE IN NORTHERN SASKATCHEWAN. THIS TEAM HYPOTHESIZES THAT THE REGION ONCE EXISTED ABOVE A MAJOR ZONE OF UNDERPLATING NEAR THE BASE OF THE CONTINENTAL CRUST. STUDENTS AND SCIENTISTS WILL COLLECT DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE TIMING AND DURATION OF MAGMATISM, METAMORPHISM, AND DENSIFICATION OF THE DEEP CRUST. THEY WILL DEVELOP MODELS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND COMPLEX IMAGES OF THE LOWER CONTINENTAL CRUST DETECTED BY GEOPHYSICISTS THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE PROCESSES THAT LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF MAGMAS OF VARYING COMPOSITION, THE MECHANISMS THAT WEAKEN OR STRENGTHEN THE DEEP CRUST, AND ULTIMATELY, THE PROCESSES THAT FACILITATE FORMATION AND STABILIZATION OF CONTINENTAL CRUST ON EARTH. MAGMATIC UNDERPLATING IS A FIRST ORDER PETROLOGIC AND TECTONIC PROCESS THAT IS CENTRAL TO MANY MODELS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION OF CONTINENTAL CRUST. HOWEVER, REMOTE STUDIES OF THE DEEP CRUST VIA GEOPHYSICS OR XENOLITHS COMMONLY LACK THE RESOLUTION TO UNEQUIVOCALLY CONSTRAIN THE IMPACTS OF UNDERPLATING. THIS PROJECT EXPLORES THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ?INTRAPLATING?, I.E., THE EMPLACEMENT OF MANTLE-DERIVED MAGMA INTO THE LOWER CONTINENTAL CRUST ABOVE THE UNDERPLATE, IS CRITICAL FOR MAGMATIC PROCESSES (ASSIMILATION, MINGLING, HYBRIDIZATION), DEFORMATION (WEAKENING AND CRUSTAL FLOW), AND SUBSEQUENT DENSIFICATION +/- FOUNDERING OR DELAMINATION OF LOWER CONTINENTAL CRUST. KEY INSIGHTS WILL BE GLEANED FROM DIRECT FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF THE MOST DEEPLY EXHUMED SECTION OF THE >20,000 KM2 ATHABASCA GRANULITE TERRANE (1.1-1.6 GPA). THESE EXPOSURES ARE INFERRED TO HAVE EXPERIENCED >650 M.Y. OF LOWER CRUSTAL RESIDENCE PRIOR TO EXHUMATION. THEY REPRESENT A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE CRUST-MANTLE INTERACTION AND LONG-TERM EVOLUTION OF LOWER CONTINENTAL CRUST DUE TO INTRAPLATING, METAMORPHISM, MELTING, AND DENSIFICATION IN THREE DISTINCT TECTONIC SETTINGS. DELIVERABLES INCLUDE: (I) CONSTRAINING THE TIMING AND DURATION OF MAGMATIC INTRAPLATING AND METAMORPHISM IN EACH SETTING, (II) IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING DENSIFICATION MECHANISMS, (III) CONSTRAINING THE INFLUENCE OF METASEDIMENTARY GNEISSES ON THE COMPOSITION, DENSITY, AND SEISMIC VELOCITY STRUCTURE OF INTRAPLATED LOWER CONTINENTAL CRUST, AND (IV) USING FIELD-BASED OBSERVATIONS AND DATA TO DEVELOP MORE ROBUST GEOPHYSICAL MODELS OF UNDERPLATED LOWER CONTINENTAL CRUST. CRITICAL GEOPHYSICAL GOALS INCLUDE: (1) EVALUATING THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE SETTINGS OF UNDERPLATING AND INTRAPLATING CAN BE DISTINGUISHED IN SEISMIC SURVEYS, AND (2) EVALUATING THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE INTEGRATED GEOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES IN EACH TECTONIC DOMAIN CAN INFORM MORE ROBUST INTERPRETATIONS OF THE PATTERN OF SEISMICALLY FAST LOWER CRUST DETECTED BENEATH PARTS OF NORTH AMERICA. BROADER IMPACTS INCLUDE: (I) TWO PH.D. AND 2-4 B.S. STUDENTS WILL CARRY OUT RESEARCH PROJECTS; (II) A VIRTUAL INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP FOR EARTH SCIENTISTS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FOCUSED ON THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF LOWER CONTINENTAL CRUST WILL BE HOSTED; (III) PIS AND STUDENTS WILL CONVENE A LOWER CRUSTAL FIELD FORUM WHERE PARTICIPANTS WILL VISIT AND EXPLORE THE ATHABASCA GRANULITE TERRANE AND DISCUSS GENERAL IMPLICATIONS FOR LOWER CONTINENTAL CRUST; (IV) PIS AND STUDENTS WILL ENGAGE IN EARTH SCIENCE OUTREACH AS PART OF FIELD WORK IN THE VICINITY OF STONY RAPIDS, SASKATCHEWAN.

THIS RESEARCH SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW MULTIPLE SOURCES OF STRESS IMPACT HUMANS, FREE-RANGING LIVESTOCK, AND WILDLIFE IN SHARED RANGELANDS IN THE WESTERN US. INCREASINGLY FREQUENT AND MORE SEVERE DROUGHTS MAKE PLANT FORAGE FOR WILD HERBIVORES AND CATTLE LESS PREDICTABLE AND ABUNDANT, EVEN AS THE RETURN OF GRAY WOLVES TO PARTS OF THE LANDSCAPE INCREASES PREDATION RISK. AS A RESULT, WILDLIFE SUCH AS DEER AND ELK, AS WELL AS FREE-RANGING LIVESTOCK, MAY BE FORCED TO TRADE OFF FOOD AND SECURITY, AND RANCHERS GRAZING THEIR CATTLE ON PUBLIC LAND MAY FACE MORE UNCERTAINTY. THIS RESEARCH WILL ASSESS (1) HOW DROUGHT AND WOLVES INTERACT TO AFFECT WILD HERBIVORES AND FREE-RANGING CATTLE DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE, (2) HOW DECISION-MAKERS RESPOND TO THESE TWO SOURCES OF STRESS, AND (3) HOW INFORMATION, PROVIDED VIA A NEW WILDLIFE AND PLANT FORECASTING APPLICATION, IS RECEIVED AND USED BY BOTH RANCHERS AND WILDLIFE MANAGERS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF HUMAN AND WILDLIFE CONNECTIONS AND INTERACTIONS IN RANGELAND ECOSYSTEMS VIA A DOCUMENTARY FILM, AS WELL AS BY TRAINING CITIZEN SCIENTISTS TO CLASSIFY CAMERA-TRAPPED IMAGES OF RANGELAND WILDLIFE. A DIVERSE GROUP OF UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AS WELL AS A POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHER WILL BE TRAINED OVER THE COURSE OF THIS PROJECT. OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CLIMATE AND CARNIVORE RISKS AFFECT HUMAN DECISION-MAKING, AS WELL AS HOW HUMANS IMPACT RANGELAND FOOD WEBS VIA CATTLE STOCKING AND WILDLIFE REMOVAL, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES FOR COEXISTENCE BETWEEN HUMANS AND WILDLIFE IN CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS. ECOLOGICAL SHIFTS BROUGHT ABOUT BY CLIMATIC CHANGE CAN STRONGLY INTERACT WITH OTHER SOURCES OF CHANGE, SUCH AS RECOLONIZING LARGE CARNIVORES, TO ALTER FOOD WEB DYNAMICS AND POTENTIALLY REDUCE ECOSYSTEM PROVISIONING FOR HUMANS. THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY SUCH INTERACTIONS ALSO CHALLENGES HUMAN DECISION-MAKING. A CRITICAL GAP EXISTS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS HUMAN-WILDLIFE SYSTEMS VIA WILD FOOD WEBS, AND HOW NATURAL RESOURCE DECISION-MAKERS RESPOND TO SUCH STRESS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS (E.G., CLIMATE CHANGE AND NOVEL PREDATORS) WILL HAVE COMPLEX AND INTERACTIVE EFFECTS ON HUMAN-WILDLIFE SYSTEMS. EFFECTS WILL LIKELY OCCUR VIA TROPHIC INTERACTIONS AMONG PREDATORS, PREY, DOMESTIC ANIMALS, AND PLANTS WITHIN SHARED FOOD WEBS, POTENTIALLY REDUCING THE PROVISIONING OF HUMANS FROM THE SHARED ECOSYSTEM AND HUMAN TOLERANCE FOR PREDATORY AND COMPETITIVE WILDLIFE, AND INCREASING UNCERTAINTY FOR NATURAL RESOURCE DECISION-MAKERS. THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO ADVANCE MODELS, TOOLS AND THEORY TO (A) UNDERSTAND HOW MULTIPLE STRESSORS INTERACTIVELY AFFECT FOOD WEBS IN WHICH HUMANS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS ARE EMBEDDED, AND (B) IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY FEEDBACKS AMONG NATURAL RESOURCE DECISION-MAKERS AND HUMAN-WILDLIFE SYSTEMS IN RESPONSE TO MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS. SUCH INFORMATION WOULD ASSIST IN IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL ?TIPPING POINTS? IN SYSTEM RESILIENCY AND ALLOW FOR BETTER MANAGEMENT OF INTERACTING WILDLAND AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS. USING A FACTORIAL DESIGN OF STUDY SITES ACROSS COMBINATIONS OF WOLF PRESENCE AND DROUGHT IN OREGON AND IDAHO, WE WILL STUDY RANCHER-WILDLIFE-PLANT DYNAMICS. DATA WILL STEM FROM RANCHER SURVEYS, WILDLIFE CAMERA GRIDS, AND GROUND-SURVEYED AND REMOTELY-SENSED PLANT DATA. WE WILL INTEGRATE SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL DATA INTO A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING FRAMEWORK, WHICH WILL DRIVE ECOLOGICAL FORECASTS OF PREDATION AND COMPETITION RISK TO LIVESTOCK FOR RANCHERS AND MANAGERS TO USE IN FUTURE DECISION MAKING. TO UNDERSTAND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGER DECISIONS, WHICH OCCUR AT LARGER SPATIAL SCALES THAN RANCHER DECISIONS, WE WILL CONDUCT A BROAD-SCALE ANALYSIS OF THE RANGELAND SES ACROSS THE WESTERN US USING PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE WILDLIFE AND SOCIAL DATA AND REMOTELY-SENSED ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS. BY ANALYZING DECISION-MAKING ACROSS THESE SPATIAL SCALES, WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY KEY FEEDBACKS, EMERGENT PHENOMENA, AND POTENTIAL TIPPING POINTS IN RESILIENCE FOR THE HUMAN AND WILDLIFE COMPONENTS OF THE RANGELAND SES.

ONE PROMINENT EXAMPLE IS THE ADOPTION AND DEPLOYMENT OF BODY-WORN CAMERAS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS. BODY WORN CAMERAS ARE SMALL VIDEO AND AUDIO RECORDING DEVICES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WEAR WHEN IN THE FIELD AND WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE PUBLIC. BODY-WORN CAMERAS HAVE A VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEATURES THAT CAN POTENTIALLY TRANSFORM OFFICER TRAINING, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND PERFORMANCE, AND INCREASE OR DECREASE COMMUNITY TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS FINDINGS ON THE EFFECTS OF BODY-WORN CAMERAS ON INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS HAVE VARIED WIDELY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATIONAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS INTERACT TO INFLUENCE HOW OFFICERS AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE RESPOND TO BODY-WORN CAMERAS. THE PROJECT COLLECTS DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES TO ANSWER RESEARCH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF BODY-WORN CAMERAS. IN THE FIRST PHASE OF DATA COLLECTION, THE PROJECT TEAM COLLECTS SURVEY DATA FROM PATROL OFFICERS WORKING IN NEARLY 60 AGENCIES THAT USE BODY-WORN CAMERAS. THE SURVEYS INCLUDE MEASURES OF BURNOUT, WELL-BEING, PROACTIVITY, AND ATTITUDES REGARDING THEIR ORGANIZATIONS AND BODY-WORN CAMERAS. THE PROJECT TEAM ALSO CONDUCTS INTERVIEWS WITH HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS FROM EACH OF THESE AGENCIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND BODY-WORN CAMERA IMPLEMENTATION IN EACH AGENCY.

MOREOVER, FOR FIREFIGHTERS STRUGGLING WITH STRESS, THE FIRE SERVICE CULTURE DISCOURAGES SHOWING WEAKNESS AND SEEKING HELP, CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR STRUGGLES. THESE ISSUES HAVE LED TO STAFFING ISSUES AND A SHORTAGE OF RECRUITS IN MANY AREAS. THIS PROJECT EXAMINES VARIOUS COPING STRATEGIES AS WELL AS THE INFLUENCE OF FIRE SERVICE CULTURE THAT VARIES ACROSS DEPARTMENTS, STATIONS, AND SHIFTS. FOCUSING ON THE IMPACT OF THE FIRE SERVICE CULTURE PROVIDES UNIQUE INSIGHT INTO THE ROLE OF ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE ON MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. FINDINGS OF THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTE TO AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF STRESS AND COPING FOR FIRST RESPONDERS, ENSURING THAT COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH-QUALITY EMERGENCY RESPONSES WHILE PROMOTING THE WELL-BEING OF FIRST RESPONDERS. THIS PROJECT TESTS A MULTILEVEL MODEL OF THE EFFECTS OF FIRE SERVICE CULTURE, OPERATIONALIZED AS MASCULINITY CONTEST CULTURE, A CULTURE THAT EMPHASIZES COMPETITION, RISK, AND HIDING WEAKNESSES. THROUGH STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING, THE RESEARCHERS COLLECT DATA FROM EMPLOYEES OF FIRE DEPARTMENTS THAT VARY BY SIZE, REGION, AND TYPE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

ONE COMMON THEME OF RANDOM MATRIX THEORY IS THAT A LARGE FAMILY OF RANDOM MATRICES SHARES THE SAME LIMITING DISTRIBUTION DUE TO UNIVERSALITY PHENOMENA. THIS IS AN ANALOGUE OF THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM IN CLASSICAL PROBABILITY, WHERE THE ONLY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE I.I.D. RANDOM VARIABLES ARE SOME MOMENT CONDITIONS.

THE CENTER WILL BENEFIT K-12, UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION, AND GRADUATE EDUCATION BY ADDING NEW COURSE MATERIALS AND INTRODUCING INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN CLASSROOMS. THE PROJECT?S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WILL SYNERGISTICALLY AID (I) ESTABLISHING AN EDUCATION-TO-WORKFORCE PIPELINE FOR STUDENTS, (II) PROVIDING MULTIDISCIPLINARY TRAINING FOR CAREERS IN INDUSTRY, RESEARCH CENTERS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND ACADEMIA, AND (III) STRENGTHENING RESEARCH CAPABILITY AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE OF EARLY CAREER PROFESSIONALS IN THE PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF NITROGEN FOR CEREAL CROPS IS THE ADDITION OF AMMONIA AND OR NITRATE FERTILIZER. HOWEVER, THE CONTINUOUS USE OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS TO INCREASE FOOD PRODUCTION IS UNSUSTAINABLE AS THEY CONSUME NEARLY 1% OF THE WORLD?S ENERGY AND CONTRIBUTE TO 3-5% OF GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION. THE CENTER FOR CLIMATE-CONSCIOUS AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGIES (CCAT) AIMS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS PRODUCTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE BY ADOPTING MICROBIAL BIOFERTILIZERS AS AN ALTERNATIVE. BY LEVERAGING GENOMICS INFORMATION, THE CCAT TEAM DEVELOPS NOVEL APTAMER-BASED IDENTIFICATION AND ISOLATION TO OBTAIN CO-HABITUATING CONSORTIA OF MICROBES WITH NITROGEN-FIXING, CARBON-FIXING, AND PHOSPHOROUS-SOLUBILIZING CAPABILITIES FROM LOCAL RELEVANT SOIL AND CROP SAMPLES. THE RESEARCH WILL SCREEN BACTERIA IN THE RHIZOSPHERE FOR P SOLUBILIZATION, MINERAL DISSOLUTION, AND N2/CO2 FIXATION, DEVELOP METHODS FOR MASS PRODUCTION AND ENCAPSULATION OF SYNTHETIC CONSORTIA, EVALUATE THE ESTABLISHMENT AND REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS, AND MODEL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY. WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH PRODUCERS FROM RURAL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO DETERMINE PREFERENCES AND ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT MICROBIAL FERTILIZERS AND INCREASE FARM PROFITABILITY. THE PROJECT WILL BUILD A THRIVING TEAM THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A CONTINUUM OF CLIMATE-FRIENDLY SOLUTIONS FOR CROP NUTRITION, DEVELOP A WELL-EQUIPPED FUTURE-READY WORKFORCE, AND POSITIVELY IMPACT THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROWTH OF RURAL DAKOTAS.

WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE, INCREASED FLOODING OF SOILS WITH SALINE WATER DISRUPTS THE NATURAL CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS AND CARBON BETWEEN SOILS, THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE OCEAN. COASTAL MARSHES ARE AN IMPORTANT SINK OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON, AND CARBON ACCUMULATION RATES IN COASTAL MARSHES EXCEED THOSE OF TEMPERATE FORESTS. WHEREAS GRADUAL SEA-LEVEL RISE RESULTS IN SLOW, LATERAL INLAND MOVEMENT OF SALINE GROUNDWATER, STORMS AND LARGE TIDES CAUSE RAPID INUNDATION OF SOILS WITH SALTWATER, DRIVING VERTICAL TRANSPORT OF SALT INTO SOILS. THE ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PROCESSES ARE VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE, PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE TRANSITION BETWEEN COASTAL MARSHES AND FORESTED UPLANDS, WHERE INCREASING SOIL WATER SALINITY RESULTS IN TREE MORTALITY AND THE FORMATION OF ?GHOST FORESTS?. HOWEVER, THE PATTERNS OF SALINITY CHANGE BENEATH THE SUBSURFACE IN SOILS AND GROUNDWATER ARE UNCLEAR, PARTICULARLY AS NUMEROUS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACK MECHANISMS MAY EXIST. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEATH OF INDIVIDUAL TREES MAY LOCALLY ENHANCE VERTICAL TRANSPORT OF SALT IF DEAD ROOTS AND SURROUNDING SOIL SERVE AS PREFERENTIAL PATHWAYS FOR THE TRANSPORT OF SALINE WATER. VARIATIONS IN SOIL TEXTURE (E.G., GRAIN SIZE) ACROSS THE MARSH-UPLAND TRANSITION MAY ALSO RESULT IN VARIABILITY IN RATES OF SALINIZATION BOTH DURING SHORT-TERM STORM EVENTS AND IN RESPONSE TO GRADUAL SEA-LEVEL RISE. THIS PROJECT WILL APPLY ELECTRICAL GEOPHYSICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES AND HYDROLOGICAL MODELS OF SALTWATER TRANSPORT TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF SUBSURFACE HETEROGENEITY (BOTH GEOLOGY AND VEGETATION INDUCED) IN REGULATING GRADUAL AND RAPID (STORM SURGE) HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES ACROSS MULTIPLE MARSH-UPLAND TRANSITION ZONES. ELECTRICAL GEOPHYSICAL IMAGING METHODS PROVIDE SPATIALLY CONTINUOUS, NON-INVASIVE INFORMATION OF VARIATIONS IN SALINITY. IN THIS PROJECT, THESE METHODS WILL BE DEPLOYED TO MONITOR THE EVOLUTION OF SALINITY CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR STORM EVENTS. THE WORK WILL [1] PRODUCE DATA AND SIMULATIONS TO IMPROVE CONCEPTUAL MODELS FOR SALINIZATION RESULTING FROM STORM EVENTS BY INCORPORATING THE ROLE OF SUBSURFACE HETEROGENEITY; [2] DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES OF HYDROLOGICAL MODELS OF SALTWATER TRANSPORT BY INCORPORATING SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY RICH GEOPHYSICAL OBSERVATIONS; [3] PROMOTE AWARENESS OF GEOPHYSICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR INVESTIGATING COASTAL LANDSCAPES WITHIN A BROAD COMMUNITY OF INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENTISTS; [4] ENGAGE A DIVERSE BODY OF STUDENTS AND EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS IN WORKSHOPS STUDYING THE MARSH-UPLAND TRANSITION.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO DEVELOPING A HIGHLY SKILLED AND DIVERSE WORKFORCE CONSISTING OF SEVERAL GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL STUDENTS, POST-DOCTORAL SCHOLARS, AND EARLY CAREER FACULTY. FURTHER, EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO ENGAGE WITH A BROADER AUDIENCE (E.G., RURAL COMMUNITIES, STUDENTS K-12, BIOCHAR PRODUCERS, CONSERVATION PERSONNEL), WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON EDUCATING PEOPLE FROM TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS NSF EPSCOR RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT TRACK-2 FOCUSED EPSCOR COLLABORATIONS (NSF EPSCOR RII TRACK-2 FEC) PROJECT IS TO MAKE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS MORE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE, REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM AGRICULTURAL SOURCES IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE MANNER (E.G., IMPROVING SOIL HEALTH AND WATER AND AIR QUALITY), AND ENHANCE THE RESILIENCE OF FARMERS TO THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE GOAL WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING THREE THRUST AREAS, COMPRISED OF RESEARCH, EDUCATIONAL, AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES: (A) DEVELOPMENT OF ENGINEERED BIOCHAR FOR USE IN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS; (B) PROVIDING NEW INSIGHTS TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF USING ENGINEERED BIOCHAR ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND CROP PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; AND (C) QUANTIFY THE SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS OF USING ENGINEERED BIOCHAR. THE RESEARCH PROJECT LEVERAGES EACH INSTITUTION'S UNIQUE AND COMPLEMENTARY RESEARCH EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: (1) DEVELOP ENGINEERED BIOCHAR TO LOWER AGRICULTURAL NITROUS OXIDE EMISSION IN A CLIMATE-RESILIENT SYSTEM, (2) DETERMINE THE PLANT GENES AND PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH A POSITIVE YIELD RESPONSE TO ENGINEERED BIOCHAR AMENDMENT UNDER WATER DEFICIT CONDITIONS, (3) ELUCIDATE THE IMPACT OF ENGINEERED BIOCHAR ON NUTRIENTS, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND MICROBIAL PROCESSES, (4) SIMULATE THE IMPACT OF EXTREME EVENTS ON CROP YIELD AND NUTRIENT LOSSES, AND IDENTIFY THE SUITES OF CONDITIONS THAT ARE LESS IMPACTFUL FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, AND (5) ASSESS FARMERS' PERCEPTIONS AND THE ECONOMICS OF USING ENGINEERED BIOCHAR ALONG WITH THE ANIMAL WASTE.

THESE COMMUNITIES, WHICH ARE DEEPLY INTERTWINED WITH OCEAN RESOURCES, ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY VULNERABLE TO THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WITH LARGE PARTS OF THESE COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, PROJECTED TO BE INCREASINGLY IMPACTED BY NUISANCE FLOODING AND POTENTIALLY PERMANENTLY UNDERWATER BY THE END OF THE CENTURY, THE NEED FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES IS URGENT. THE PROJECT'S IMPORTANCE LIES IN ITS FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A SCALABLE AND TRANSFERABLE FRAMEWORK FOR SUCH STRATEGIES, THEREBY ENHANCING COASTAL RESILIENCE. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT AIMS AT DEVELOPING THE KNOWLEDGE, DATA, MODELING, AND HUMAN NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT A NEW ENGLAND HUB FOR COASTAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE THAT IS COMMUNITY-DRIVEN. THIS ALIGNS DIRECTLY WITH THE NSF'S MISSION TO PROMOTE THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE TO ADVANCE NATIONAL HEALTH, PROSPERITY, AND WELFARE. THE 3CRS HUB SEEKS TO ADDRESS AND EXPLORE SOLUTIONS FOR THE INTERSECT OF FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF POVERTY, LIMITED HEALTHCARE ACCESS, INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND LIMITED CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION CAPACITY IN WATERFRONT COMMUNITIES. BEYOND ADDRESSING THESE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES, THE PROJECT ALSO HOLDS POTENTIAL FOR BROADER SOCIETAL BENEFITS. IT AIMS TO ADVANCE THE FIELD OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE, SUPPORT EDUCATION AND DIVERSITY THROUGH THE MENTORSHIP OF EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS, AND BENEFIT SOCIETY BY INCREASING THE RESILIENCE OF COMMUNITIES THAT PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE NATION'S ECONOMY AND CULTURAL HERITAGE. THE 3CRS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO TACKLE THREE KEY RESEARCH CHALLENGES FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE PLANNING. THE FIRST CHALLENGE IS TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE DYNAMIC CHANGES IN HUMAN HEALTH, WELLBEING, HABITABILITY, ENVIRONMENT, AND OTHER CLIMATE VULNERABILITIES. THIS INVOLVES A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEX INTERPLAY BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND VARIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. THE SECOND CHALLENGE IS TO DOWNSCALE CLIMATE MODELS OUTPUTS AND INFORMATION TO THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND PROJECT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE FOR PLANNERS. THIS REQUIRES SOPHISTICATED MODELING TECHNIQUES (E.G. DYNAMICAL AND AI-BASED) THAT CAN TRANSLATE LARGE-SCALE CLIMATE MODELS PROJECTIONS INTO ACTIONABLE INFORMATION AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. THE THIRD CHALLENGE IS TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY TO INCORPORATE DATA, KNOWLEDGE, AND EXPERT NETWORKS INTO COMMUNITY RESILIENCE PLANNING PROCESSES. THIS INVOLVES BUILDING ROBUST SYSTEMS FOR DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSIS, AND DISSEMINATION, AS WELL AS FOSTERING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXPERT NETWORKS. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE COLLECTIVE, WHICH WILL CO-PRODUCE THREE PRIMARY KNOWLEDGE STREAMS: OBSERVATIONAL DATA, COMMUNITY-DRIVEN METRICS OF RESILIENCE, AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION NARRATIVES. A NOVEL TOOL, THE NEW ENGLAND-WIDE COASTAL HAZARDS ANALYSIS MODELING AND PREDICTION SYSTEM (NE-CHAMP), WILL BE DEPLOYED TO ENABLE COMMUNITIES TO VISUALIZE AND ANALYZE THE IMPACTS OF PRESENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, HEALTH, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, AND OTHER COMMUNITY-DRIVEN RESILIENCE METRICS. IN THE FINAL PHASE OF THE PROJECT, A SERIES OF SHARED RESILIENCE ROADMAPS WILL BE PRODUCED THAT DIGITALLY DOCUMENT THE TRANSFERABLE PROCESSES FOR DEVELOPING COASTAL ADAPTATION STRATEGIES, THEREBY PROVIDING A BLUEPRINT FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES FACING SIMILAR CHALLENGES.

IT IS ALSO THE MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT MOST ORGANISMS CANNOT ACCESS IT FROM THE AIR DIRECTLY. ONLY CERTAIN SPECIALIZED MICROBES HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONVERT NITROGEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE INTO A BIOLOGICALLY USEFUL FORM IN A PROCESS KNOWN AS NITROGEN FIXATION. SOME OF THESE MICROBES ARE FREE-LIVING, BUT MOST LIVE IN A CLOSE SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATION WITHIN THE ROOTS OF PLANTS, EXCHANGING NITROGEN FOR CARBON. THIS NITROGEN-FIXING SYMBIOSIS IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF THE GLOBAL NITROGEN CYCLE, AND IT IS CENTRAL TO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE NITROGEN IS OFTEN THE LIMITING FACTOR FOR CROP GROWTH. IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW NITROGEN-FIXING PLANT-BACTERIAL PARTNERSHIPS FORM IN NATURE AND HOW THEY RESPOND TO AN ENVIRONMENT FILLED WITH CHALLENGES AND IN CONSTANT FLUX. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE A DATA-INTENSIVE FRAMEWORK TO LEARN HOW PLANTS AND BACTERIA CHOOSE THEIR PARTNERS AND HOW THIS CHOICE INFLUENCES AND RESPONDS TO SURROUNDING SPECIES, SOIL, AND CLIMATE. A SECOND PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT IS TO TRAIN STUDENTS FROM GROUPS UNDERREPRESENTED IN SCIENCE. STUDENTS WILL BE PREPARED FOR THE DATA-INTENSIVE CAREERS NOW NEEDED ACROSS STEM DISCIPLINES USING AN INNOVATIVE MENTORSHIP PROGRAM AND INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH INCLUDING FIELDWORK, LABORATORY WORK, AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY. THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE DIVERSITY OF NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA AND OTHER MICROBES ASSOCIATING WITH PLANT ROOTS ACROSS THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT USING NSF-SPONSORED ECOLOGICAL MONITORING RESOURCES THROUGH NEON (THE NATIONAL ECOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY NETWORK). AT EACH OF 45 NEON SITES, ENVIRONMENTAL DATA WILL BE COMBINED WITH DATA ON THE NITROGEN-FIXING SYMBIOSIS. SPECIFICALLY, INVESTIGATORS WILL SAMPLE THE MICROBIOME IN THE SOIL AND ROOT NODULES, AND WILL ASSAY LEAF ISOTOPES TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF FUNCTION OF NITROGEN-FIXING SYMBIONTS. LEVERAGING DATA FROM THESE DIFFERENT SOURCES, THE PIS WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER MICROORGANISMS AND PLANT PARTNERS ARE EACH LIMITED BY THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, SUCH AS ARIDITY. THEY WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHOOSINESS OF PLANT OR MICROBE PARTNERS LIMIT THE EXTENT OF THE ASSOCIATION. IN ADDITION, BY EXAMINING PATTERNS IN THE TREE OF LIFE, THE PIS WILL BE ABLE TO INFER WHETHER HIGHLY SPECIFIC PARTNERSHIPS HAVE PERSISTED ACROSS EVOLUTIONARY TIME. FINALLY, MODELS WILL BE USED TO ADDRESS SYNTHETIC QUESTIONS ACROSS ALL DATA SOURCES. FOR EXAMPLE, A MODEL CAN TEST THE PREDICTION THAT ARID ENVIRONMENTS FAVOR HIGHLY SPECIFIC ASSOCIATIONS, IN WHICH BOTH MICROBES AND PLANTS CHOOSE SPECIFIC PARTNERS IN THOSE STRESSFUL SETTINGS.

FIELDWORK IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF SOME TYPES OF STEM RESEARCH, YET IT PRESENTS UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND INCIVILITY, INCLUDING SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LIMITED COMMUNICATION METHODS. ALTHOUGH UNIVERSITIES REQUIRE PHYSICAL AND EQUIPMENT SAFETY PLANS, THERE HAVE BEEN FEW EFFORTS TO ENSURE SAFETY FROM HARASSMENT IN FIELDWORK ENVIRONMENTS. THEREFORE, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO PILOT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH FOR SAFE, INCLUSIVE, AND RESPONSIBLE RESEARCH (CASIR2) THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES SEXUAL HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND INCIVILITY TO PROMOTE THE SAFETY AND INCLUSION OF WOMEN IN STEM WITH AN EMPHASIS ON OFF-CAMPUS AND OFF-SITE RESEARCH FIELDWORK. THE PROJECT WILL PILOT CASIR2 WITH A COLLECTION OF FIELD TEAMS, CONSISTING OF FACULTY AND UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, AT TWO UNIVERSITIES TO PROMOTE THE SAFETY AND INCLUSION OF WOMEN IN STEM FIELDWORK. THE PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE COMPONENTS AND CONDITIONS OF STRATEGIES THAT CAN REDUCE HARASSMENT. CASIR2 CONSISTS OF FOUR COMPONENTS: (1) BRINGING IN THE BYSTANDER?, AN IN-PERSON BYSTANDER INTERVENTION PROGRAM, ADAPTED FOR FIELD RESEARCH; (2) A PRE-DEPARTURE ORIENTATION THAT INCLUDES A FACILITATED DISCUSSION ON FIELD SAFETY AND RESPECTFUL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TEAM MEMBERS; (3) A FIELDWORK SAFETY TOOLKIT INCLUDES VIRTUAL RESOURCES DETAILING EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, SETTING BOUNDARIES, AND REPORTING; AND (4) A POST-FIELDWORK DEBRIEF THAT INCLUDES A FACILITATED DISCUSSION ON THE FIELDWORK TRIP AND REVIEW OF THE SAFETY TEMPLATE. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF IMPLEMENTING CASIR2 ON RESEARCH PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCES RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT, PERCEPTIONS OF THE FIELDWORK CLIMATE AND INTENTIONS TO PERSIST IN STEM, AND INTENTIONS TO HELP OTHERS AND SEEK HELP.

FOR INSTANCE, RABIES VIRUS INFECTS AND KILLS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EACH YEAR WHEN WILD ANIMALS CARRYING THE VIRUS BITE HUMANS AND TRANSMIT THE VIRUS TO THEM. OTHER VIRUSES THAT OCCASIONALLY LEAP FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS ARE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEY CAN ALSO TRANSMIT FROM HUMAN TO HUMAN AND THUS POTENTIALLY SEED EPIDEMICS OR PANDEMICS. UNFORTUNATELY, WE DO NOT YET HAVE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS IN PLACE TO STOP THESE INFECTIOUS DISEASES FROM SPILLING OVER INTO THE HUMAN POPULATION. INSTEAD, OUR CURRENT APPROACH TO THESE ANIMAL DISEASES IS REACTIVE, AND FOCUSES ON MEDICAL TREATMENT OF HUMANS WHO HAVE BECOME INFECTED AND CORRALLING HUMAN OUTBREAKS BEFORE THEY CAN SPREAD AND BECOME FULL BLOWN EPIDEMICS OR PANDEMICS. A PROMISING SOLUTION TO THIS CHALLENGING PROBLEM IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF WILDLIFE VACCINES THAT CAN SPREAD THEMSELVES FROM ONE ANIMAL TO THE NEXT. BY SELF-DISSEMINATING, THESE VACCINES MAGNIFY THE SPREAD OF IMMUNITY WITHIN THE WILD ANIMAL POPULATION AND REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE RISK OF SPILLOVER INTO THE HUMAN POPULATION. ALTHOUGH MULTIPLE SELF-DISSEMINATING ANIMAL VACCINES ARE BEING DEVELOPED, WE DO NOT YET HAVE THE MATHEMATICAL, STATISTICAL, AND COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS WE NEED TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THEIR PERFORMANCE AND THUS MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR POSSIBLE USE. WORK ON THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP THESE QUANTITATIVE TOOLS AND ENABLE CANDIDATE SELF-DISSEMINATING VACCINES TO BE CRITICALLY EVALUATED BEFORE THEY ARE USED. IN ADDITION, THIS PROJECT WILL TRAIN FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM RURAL BACKGROUNDS TO USE MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO EVALUATE AND OPTIMIZE EMERGING BIOTECHNOLOGIES CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE OF THE US ECONOMY. STUDENT RECRUITMENT WILL BE FACILITATED BY OFFERING COMPETITIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT RELIEVES PRESSURE TO ABANDON RESEARCH EXPERIENCES IN FAVOR OF TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT. FINALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF A WEBSITE THAT EXPLAINS SELF-DISSEMINATING VACCINES TO THE PUBLIC, DISSEMINATES RELEVANT RESEARCH RESULTS, AND EXAMINES THE STATE OF THIS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. BEFORE MAKING THE DECISION TO CONDUCT EVEN SMALL-SCALE FIELD TRIALS, THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A SELF-DISSEMINATING VACCINE WILL IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH SHOULD BE QUANTIFIED. THIS REQUIREMENT POSES A FORMIDABLE TECHNICAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE DATA ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE VACCINE WITHIN THE TARGET ANIMAL POPULATION CANNOT BE COLLECTED PRIOR TO RELEASE. THIS PROJECT WILL OVERCOME THIS TECHNICAL CHALLENGE USING MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF RECOMBINANT VECTOR TRANSMISSIBLE VACCINES THAT CAN BE PARAMETERIZED USING A COMBINATION OF FIELD AND LABORATORY DATA. SPECIFICALLY, MATHEMATICAL MODELS WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT INTEGRATE THE AGE STRUCTURE OF THE RESERVOIR POPULATION AND THE EXPLICIT PATTERN OF VACCINE SHEDDING FROM ANIMALS INFECTED WITH VACCINE. THESE MODELS WILL TAKE THE FORM OF A SYSTEM OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. FIELD DATA WILL COME FROM TRAPPING STUDIES OF THE RESERVOIR ANIMAL THAT RECORD THE AGE OF EACH CAPTURED ANIMAL AND WHETHER IT WAS INFECTED BY THE VECTOR VIRUS USED TO CONSTRUCT THE CANDIDATE VACCINE. LABORATORY DATA WILL DESCRIBE THE TEMPORAL PATTERN OF VACCINE SHEDDING FROM RESERVOIR ANIMALS EXPERIMENTALLY INFECTED WITH THE VACCINE. APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION WILL BE USED TO PARAMETERIZE THE MODELS AND A STOCHASTIC SIMULATION FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED FOR PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF A PROPOSED VACCINE RELEASE. BY REPEATEDLY SIMULATING A VACCINE RELEASE FOR MODELS PARAMETERIZED BY DRAWING RANDOMLY FROM THE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION, THIS FRAMEWORK FAITHFULLY INTEGRATES RESERVOIR ECOLOGY, RANDOMNESS IN BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES, AND UNCERTAINTY IN PARAMETER ESTIMATES. THE METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED BY THIS PROJECT WILL BE APPLIED TO A PROTOTYPE SELF-DISSEMINATING VACCINE FOR LASSA VIRUS BUT WILL BE BROADLY APPLICABLE TO SELF-DISSEMINATING VACCINES DEVELOPING FOR A RANGE OF ANIMAL RESERVOIRS.

IN GENERAL, THIS ENERGY CAN BE ALLOCATED TO THREE BROAD CATEGORIES: GROWTH, SELF-MAINTENANCE, AND REPRODUCTION. SAID IN ANOTHER WAY, ORGANISMS CAN ALLOCATE ACQUIRED ENERGY TO GROW THEIR BODY TO ACHIEVE A LARGER SIZE, TO REPAIR AND MAINTAIN THEIR BODY TO LIVE LONGER, OR TO REPRODUCE AND CREATE THE NEW BODIES OF THEIR OFFSPRING. HOWEVER ENERGY IS LIMITING, SO IF MORE IS INVESTED INTO GROWTH, LESS CAN BE INVESTED INTO SELF-MAINTENANCE AND REPRODUCTION. THIS RESULTS IN ALLOCATION TRADE-OFFS, WHERE SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE BETTER AT GROWING, WHILE OTHERS MAY BE ABLE TO ATTAIN EXTREME LONGEVITY. WHILE THESE PATTERNS GENERALLY HOLD IN ANIMALS, IN MANY SPECIES SCIENTIST?S OBSERVE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO APPEAR TO BE ABLE TO DO IT ALL WITH FEW CONSEQUENCES, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THIS OCCURS. THIS PROPOSAL STUDIES A LONG-LIVED SEABIRD, LEACH'S STORM-PETRELS, THAT HAS BEEN STUDIED CONTINUOUSLY AT OUR SITE FOR THE PAST 70 YEARS. THIS HAS REVEALED THAT WHILE WE HAVE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOW THE EXPECTED ALLOCATION TRADE-OFFS THERE ARE ALSO MANY THAT SOMEHOW HAVE ESCAPED THAT TRADE-OFF. OUR WORK EXPLORES THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR PROCESSES THAT UNDERLIE THE ABILITY TO AVOID THIS TRADE-OFF. THIS WORK IS FOCUSED ON A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN BIOLOGY, AND WILL HELP US TO UNDERSTAND HOW MOLECULAR PROCESSES AND ORGANISMAL PERFORMANCE AFFECT LONGEVITY. THIS WORK ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORTS UNDERGRADUATE SCIENCE EDUCATION, AND WILL RESULT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INQUIRY-BASED SCIENTIFIC MODULES USED IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOMS. FACTORS DRIVING THE EVOLUTION OF DIVERSE LIFE HISTORY STRATEGIES BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN SPECIES REMAIN A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. BECAUSE RESOURCES ARE FINITE, MANY LIFE HISTORY TRAITS ARE SUBJECT TO INTRINSIC TRADE-OFFS. HOWEVER, THEORETICAL MODELS HAVE PROPOSED THAT VARIATION IN INDIVIDUAL ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN PRODUCE APPARENT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN INVESTMENT IN REPRODUCTION AND INVESTMENT IN SURVIVAL INSTEAD OF THE EXPECTED TRADE-OFF. THIS PROPOSAL TESTS THESE MODELS BY EXAMINING PHENOTYPIC VARIATION IN STRATEGIES TO BALANCE THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN CURRENT REPRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL IN A LONG-LIVED SEABIRD, LEACH'S STORM-PETRELS (HYDROBATES LEUCORHOUS), THAT HAS BEEN STUDIED CONTINUOUSLY AT OUR SITE SINCE 1953. THIS PROPOSAL HAS THREE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: 1) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND ORGANISMAL PERFORMANCE TRAITS THAT UNDERLIE THE OBSERVED VARIATION IN TRADE-OFF STRATEGIES IN THIS POPULATION, AND 2) TO DETERMINE IF INDIVIDUALS WHO APPEAR TO ESCAPE THE TRADE-OFF DO SO VIA HIGHER FORAGING EFFICIENCY AS PROPOSED IN THEORETICAL MODELS, AND 3) TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE TRADE-OFF STRATEGIES ARE FIXED OR PLASTIC IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS INFORMED BY OUR 70-YEAR DEMOGRAPHIC DATA SET, AND UTILIZES (I) A COMBINATION OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGY AND MOLECULAR TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND ORGANISMAL PERFORMANCE TRAITS THAT UNDERLIE THE OBSERVED VARIATION IN TRADE-OFF STRATEGIES, AND (II) EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS TO EXPLORE WHETHER THESE STRATEGIES ARE FIXED OR PLASTIC.

THE BROADER IMPACT/COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THIS PARTNERSHIPS FOR INNOVATION - TECHNOLOGY TRANSLATION (PFI-TT) PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP COST-EFFECTIVE AND HIGH-RESOLUTION SENSORS USING AN INNOVATIVE SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURE CALLED ORGANIC LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE (OLED). CURRENTLY MANY INEXPENSIVE SILICON-BASED IMAGE SENSORS ARE USED IN VARIOUS CONSUMER CAMERAS, BUT THESE ARE LIMITED TO WHAT THE HUMAN EYE CAN SEE. INDIUM GALLIUM ARSENIDE (INGAAS) BASED INFRARED IMAGE SENSORS DO NOT HAVE THIS LIMITATION, BUT THESE ARE EXPENSIVE AND LACK RESOLUTION QUALITY, PREVENTING THEM FROM BEING IMPLEMENTED INTO HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS. UNTIL NOW, THERE HAS BEEN NO AFFORDABLE INFRARED SENSOR TECHNOLOGY SUITABLE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS. THE PROPOSED COST-EFFECTIVE OLED-BASED INFRARED SENSOR TECHNOLOGY WILL ELIMINATE ALL OF THESE LIMITATIONS, MAKING IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY INTO HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS POSSIBLE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE OLED-BASED INFRARED SENSOR PROTOTYPE USING THE UNIQUE OPTICAL READOUT INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (ROIC) INTEGRATION APPROACH. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL INGAAS-BASED SHORT-WAVE INFRARED (SWIR) IMAGE TECHNOLOGY WITH PRICES OF $10,000 AND MORE, AND LIMITED PIXEL RESOLUTION OF ABOUT 1 MEGAPIXEL, THE PROPOSES OLED-BASED INFRARED SENSOR STRUCTURE WILL MAKE THESE CHEAPER (< $500) AND HIGH-RESOLUTION (> 100 MEGAPIXELS). THE INFRARED SENSORS WILL HAVE UNIQUE FEATURES TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS: (1) EPITAXIAL-FREE COLLOIDAL QUANTUM DOTS (CQDS) WILL BE USED AS THE SWIR SENSITIVE MATERIAL, AND (2) THE SWIR-TO-VISIBLE UP-CONVERSION OLED WITH CQDS WILL DIRECTLY CONVERT SWIR IMAGES TO VISIBLE IMAGES. IN THIS UNIQUE SWIR IMAGE SENSOR STRUCTURE, INEXPENSIVE OFF-THE-SHELF VISIBLE IMAGE SENSORS WILL BE USED FOR OPTICAL READOUT.

HOWEVER, THEY ARE BEST KNOWN FOR ENERGY TRANSDUCTION AND ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON MITOCHONDRIAL STRUCTURE BECAUSE WITHOUT APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE, MITOCHONDRIA BECOME DYSFUNCTIONAL. ALTHOUGH MITOCHONDRIA DEVELOPED FROM AN ANCESTRAL BACTERIAL CELL, DIFFERENT ORGANISMS (E.G., HUMANS, AMOEBA, ALGAE, YEAST, ETC.) MAINTAIN MITOCHONDRIAL STRUCTURE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS THAT MAINTAIN STRUCTURE ACROSS THESE ORGANISMS, WE CAN LEARN WHY THE MECHANISMS ARE DIFFERENT WHILE ALSO GAINING INSIGHT INTO THE CAUSES OF MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION. THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE THE INTRINSIC MERIT OF THE WORK AS THE VAST MAJORITY OF EUKARYOTIC CELLS CONTAIN THESE ORGANELLES. OTHER ACTIVITIES WILL INVOLVE K-16 STUDENTS. STUDENTS AT A PRIMARILY UNDERGRADUATE UNIVERSITY IN CENTRAL ARKANSAS WILL CARRY OUT THIS PROJECT. EXPOSURE TO QUALITY, WELL-FUNDED RESEARCH PROVIDES STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO EXPLORE WHETHER RESEARCH IS AN APPROPRIATE CAREER CHOICE FOR THEM. IT PREPARES STUDENTS FOR DOCTORAL PROGRAMS, AND MENTORING STUDENTS IN RESEARCH IS CRITICAL FOR RETENTION OF THOSE FROM GROUPS TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM. IN ADDITION TO TRAINING UNDERGRADUATES, THIS PROJECT INVOLVES OUTREACH TO K-6 STUDENTS. THE PLAN IS TO FORMALIZE RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, SPECIFICALLY ONES WHOSE ACT ASPIRE SCORES INDICATE A DEFICIT IN SCIENCE. INTERACTIONS WITH K-6 STUDENTS VIA HANDS-ON-ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO INSPIRE STUDENTS, SHOW THEM THAT SCIENCE IS FUN, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THEIR SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY SKILLS. THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE MITOCHONDRIA ARE DEPENDENT UPON THEIR STRUCTURE, WHICH, IN TURN, IS DEPENDENT UPON MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS, FISSION, FUSION, AND MOTILITY. IN MANY CELL TYPES SUCH AS MAMMALIAN AND YEAST CELLS, A PROTEIN FAMILY KNOWN AS DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEINS (DRPS) MAINTAINS THE HIGHLY INTERCONNECTED NETWORK OF MITOCHONDRIA. IMPORTANTLY, OUR MODEL ORGANISM, DICTYOSTELIUM DISCOIDEUM DOES NOT USE DRPS TO REGULATE MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS. RATHER, THE D. DISCOIDEUM GENOME ENCODES TWO PROTEINS, FSZA AND FSZB, WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM THE BACTERIAL CELL DIVISION PROTEIN, FTSZ. IT IS NOT UNDERSTOOD WHY SOME ORGANISMS USE DRPS AND SOME USE WHAT APPEARS TO BE DERIVED FTSZ PROTEINS. A LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS IN D. DISCOIDEUM IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY WHEN AND WHY SOME ORGANISMS REPLACED FTSZS WITH DRPS AS THEY EVOLVED. THE FIRST PROJECT GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF EXTANT FTSZS IN MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS AND WILL INVOLVE ALTERING PROTEIN LEVELS, IDENTIFYING INTERACTING PROTEINS, AND ANALYZING FTSZS STRUCTURAL COMPLEXES. RECENT WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THE CYTOSKELETON IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE REGULATION OF MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS, AND THE SECOND GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CYTOSKELETON WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS BY IDENTIFYING FISSION/FUSION EVENTS, ALONG WITH TRANSPORT VELOCITIES WHEN THE CYTOSKELETON IS DISRUPTED. COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL HELP DETERMINE IF FTSZS FUNCTION LIKE DRPS, AND HOW THE D. DISCOIDEUM CYTOSKELETON REGULATES MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS.

TO DO SO, THIS RESEARCH STUDY WILL CONDUCT A META-ANALYSIS OF MATHEMATICS TEACHING STRATEGIES USED IN INFORMAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, SUCH AS MUSEUMS, LIBRARIES, AND THE HOME. A META-ANALYSIS EXAMINES PUBLISHED RESEARCH DATA, PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO DIFFERENCES IN FINDINGS, AND USES STATISTICS TO ANALYZE THE FINDINGS ACROSS DIFFERENT STUDIES. THIS META-ANALYSIS WILL SUMMARIZE THE RELEVANT RESEARCH ABOUT MATHEMATICS TEACHING THAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED SINCE 1980, FOCUSING ON CHILDREN IN PRESCHOOL TO THE END OF THIRD GRADE. IT WILL ALSO FOCUS ON MATHEMATICS LEARNING TOPICS OF NUMBERS AND OPERATIONS, ALGEBRA, GEOMETRY, MEASUREMENT, AND DATA ANALYSIS. THE RESEARCHERS WILL INCLUDE DATA FROM PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH, CONFERENCE PROPOSALS, REPORTS, AND DISSERTATIONS.

SOCIAL GROUPS MAY HELP INDIVIDUALS BUFFER THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES IN SOME SPECIES, WHILE OTHER GROUPS MAY FORM BECAUSE BENIGN ENVIRONMENTS ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO TOLERATE EACH OTHER WHEN THERE ARE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO GO AROUND. THIS PROJECT MAKES USE OF WITHIN-SPECIES VARIATION IN SOCIAL GROUPS OF AUSTRALIAN BIRDS ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL GROUPS, AND HOW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPECIES IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS RELATE TO THEIR UNDERLYING COOPERATIVE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. BY INTEGRATING THEORY, CITIZEN SCIENCE, AND DETAILED FIELD EXPERIMENTS, THIS PROJECT WILL REVEAL HOW AND WHY SOME SPECIES CONFRONT ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES BY HELPING EACH OTHER IN GROUPS, WHILE OTHER SPECIES CONFRONT THE SAME CHALLENGES BY BREAKING THOSE GROUPS APART. THE PROJECT WILL USE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO ENGAGE PARTICIPANTS, ADDRESSING THEIR QUESTIONS AND SHARING RESEARCH OUTCOMES. THIS WILL ALLOW PARTICIPANTS TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE DIRECTION OF FUTURE RESEARCH, A KEY WAY TO LINK THE EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPATING IN CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECTS WITH LEARNING. FURTHER, THE DATA GENERATED FROM THIS STUDY WILL BE USED IN K-12 CLASSROOMS TO HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND TOPICS BOTH RELATED TO AND BEYOND BIOLOGY BY LINKING TRAIT VARIATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC SPACE THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH GALACTIC POLYMATH EDUCATION STUDIO. THIS PROJECT DEVELOPS AN ECOGEOGRAPHIC APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES THAT GENERATE WITHIN- AND ACROSS-SPECIES VARIATION IN STRUCTURE OF COOPERATIVE SOCIAL GROUPS ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS. SUCH AN INTEGRATION OF ECOGEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS ACROSS TWO LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION WILL PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION ABOUT HOW COOPERATIVE GROUPS EVOLVE. THIS APPROACH CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS WHETHER SOCIAL SYSTEMS RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS AND WHY SPECIES MAY RESPOND DIFFERENTLY FROM ONE ANOTHER. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THREE AIMS: 1) DEVELOPING A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON SOCIAL DYNAMICS MAY GENERATE VARIATION IN GROUP STRUCTURE ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS, 2) EXAMINING ECOGEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS IN SOCIAL GROUPS SIZE ACROSS SEVERAL SPECIES THROUGH THE USE A CROSS-CONTINENTAL CITIZEN SCIENCE DATASET ON AUSTRALIAN FAIRYWRENS (AVES, MALURIDAE), AND 3) EXPLICITLY LINKING DISPARATE PATTERNS OF VARIATION TO CHANGES IN FITNESS AND BEHAVIOR THROUGH OBSERVATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES IN TWO SPECIFIC SPECIES . THIS WORK WILL EXTEND SOCIAL EVOLUTION THEORY ON GROUP CONFLICT TO PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR GROUP SIZE AND BEHAVIOR ALONG ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS. ADDITIONALLY, USE OF CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA ON WITHIN-SPECIES VARIATION IN SOCIAL SYSTEMS WILL ADDRESS HOW INTERACTING FACTORS, SUCH AS TEMPERATURE, RAINFALL, OR LAND USE MIGHT DECOUPLE PATTERNS OF ENVIRONMENT-GROUP SIZE VARIATION.

AS THE KEY ENABLER TO THIS PROMISING PARADIGM, THE WIDELY ADOPTED FEDERATED LEARNING (FL) ALGORITHMS CAN RESHAPE THE EDGE COMPUTING BY OFFLOADING THE TRAINING OF LARGE-SCALE DATA TO NEARBY EDGES. TO ACHIEVE FEDERATED INTELLIGENCE WITH HIGH ACCURACY AND HIGH EFFICIENCY, A MAJOR HINDRANCE IS DATA AND SYSTEM HETEROGENEITY. WHEN DEPLOYING FL ALGORITHMS TO A PRACTICAL EDGE COMPUTING SYSTEM, THE COLLECTED RAW DATA MAY BE CORRUPTED AND PARTICIPATING EDGES MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT COMPUTATIONAL LOADS. THOSE HETEROGENEITY ISSUES SIGNIFICANTLY DEGRADE THE TRAINING EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY FOR ACHIEVING THE IDEAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. THIS PROJECT DEVELOPS A HARMONIOUS FEDERATED INTELLIGENCE FRAMEWORK TO ALLOCATE THE COLLECTED DATA TO ITS MOST FAVORABLE EDGE FOR TRAINING BASED ON ITS INTRINSIC CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIRED HARDWARE RESOURCES. BY ENABLING DATA MIGRATION ACROSS NEARBY HETEROGENEOUS EDGES, BOTH LEARNING MODELS AND HETEROGENEOUS DATA CAN BE FED TO THE OPTIMAL EDGE FOR TRAINING WITHOUT EITHER WASTING OR OVERLY EXPLOITING HARDWARE RESOURCES.

THIS CREATED AN INADVERTENT EXPERIMENT BY SOCIETY THAT HAD TWO OPPOSING CONSEQUENCES. FORESTS RETAINED ONLY A FRACTION OF THIS ADDED NITROGEN. THE REST WASHED DOWNSTREAM AND REDUCED WATER QUALITY. NITROGEN POLLUTION ALSO ACTED AS A FERTILIZER WHICH ENHANCED THE ABILITY OF TREES AND SOILS TO STORE CARBON AND SLOW CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNKNOWN WHETHER THESE CONSEQUENCES WILL PERSIST AS NITROGEN POLLUTION DECLINES DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT. NOTABLY, THERE IS A LACK OF LONG-TERM RECORDS THAT CAN BE USED TO INVESTIGATE HOW EASTERN US FORESTS RECOVER FROM NITROGEN POLLUTION DURING THE FINAL CHAPTER OF SOCIETY?S INADVERTENT EXPERIMENT. THE RESEARCH ADDRESSES WHETHER THESE CONSEQUENCES WILL PERSIST, RECOVER, OR REACH A NEW NORMAL, THROUGH LONG-TERM RECORDS OF FOREST RESPONSES TO NITROGEN POLLUTION AT THE FERNOW EXPERIMENTAL FOREST IN WEST VIRGINIA. THE PROJECT BROADENS PARTICIPATION IN SCIENCE BY ENGAGING LOCAL 8TH GRADE STUDENTS IN RURAL TUCKER COUNTY, WV THROUGH FIELD TRIPS AND IN-CLASS ACTIVITIES. THIS RESEARCH COUPLES ONE OF THE COUNTRY?S LONGEST STREAM WATER DATASETS WITH THE CESSATION OF ONE OF ITS LONGEST WATERSHED NITROGEN ADDITION EXPERIMENTS AT THE FERNOW EXPERIMENTAL FOREST.

FREEZING WATER, SPECIFICALLY ICE CRYSTALS, CAN DAMAGE SOFT TISSUES AND KILL ORGANISMS THAT ARE NOT ADAPTED TO FREEZING CONDITIONS. SEVERAL SPECIES ? FROM FISH TO BEETLES TO BACTERIA ? HAVE DEVELOPED PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS TO WITHSTAND FREEZING CONDITIONS, MOST NOTABLY BY PRODUCING PROTEINS THAT BIND TO ICE, SOME OF WHICH ARE CALLED ?ANTIFREEZE? PROTEINS. JUST AS ANTIFREEZE SOLUTION IN A CAR LOWERS THE FREEZING POINT OF WATER, ANTIFREEZE PROTEINS PROTECT ORGANISMS? TISSUES FROM DAMAGING ICE CRYSTALS. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THESE PROTEINS IN MARINE INVERTEBRATES SUCH AS SEA STARS, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT PREDATORS IN INTERTIDAL HABITATS. RECENT GENETIC EVIDENCE SUGGESTS SEA STARS MAY PRODUCE NEW FORMS OF THESE PROTEINS. THIS STUDY WILL INVESTIGATE THE GENETIC MECHANISMS BEHIND INTERTIDAL SEA STARS? ABILITY TO PRODUCE PROTEINS TO SURVIVE IN SUB-FREEZING WATER IN ALASKA AND HOW PROTEIN PRODUCTION VARIES BY SEASON AND TEMPERATURE. UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTION OF THESE PROTEINS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT TRIGGER THEIR PRODUCTION WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO MAKE PREDICTIONS ON HOW SEA STARS WILL ADAPT TO EXTREME CLIMATIC EVENTS. THE RESULTS FROM THIS WORK MAY AID THE GROWING MARICULTURE INDUSTRY FOR INVERTEBRATES SUCH AS SEA CUCUMBERS AND URCHINS, WHICH ARE CLOSE RELATIVES OF SEA STARS. FURTHERMORE, IF SEA STARS PRODUCE NOVEL PROTEINS, THEIR DISCOVERY MAY LEAD TO INNOVATIONS IN BIOMEDICAL CRYOPRESERVATION AND COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE. THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATES, PARTICULARLY ALASKA NATIVES, TO LEARN PROFESSIONAL SKILLS IN STEM THROUGH MENTORING, RESEARCH, WORKSHOPS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. INTERTIDAL INVERTEBRATES IN POLAR REGIONS OVERCOME UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES COMPARED TO THEIR PELAGIC (OPEN WATER) AND BENTHIC (DEEP SEA) COUNTERPARTS, INCLUDING LARGE DAILY WINTER TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS. FREEZING CONDITIONS CAN LEAD TO LETHAL CELLULAR DAMAGE THROUGH THE FORMATION OF ICE CRYSTALS ON SOFT TISSUES. MANY COLD-ADAPTED ECTOTHERMIC ORGANISMS HAVE EVOLVED MECHANISMS TO PREVENT DAMAGE FROM COLD BY PRODUCING ICE-BINDING PROTEINS (IBPS). IBPS BIND TO ICE CRYSTAL PLANES AND HAVE A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS, FROM ICE RECRYSTALLIZATION AND GROWTH INHIBITION (ANTIFREEZE) TO THE CONTROLLED FORMATION (NUCLEATION) OF ICE.

OTHER HYPOTHESES PREDICT THE OPPOSITE: TISSUES RELATED TO REPRODUCTION WILL AGE FASTER BECAUSE OF SELECTION FOR EARLY LIFE FITNESS. THIS RESEARCH WILL EXAMINE AGING DYNAMICS ACROSS LIFE STAGES AND TISSUES, AND IN RESPONSE TO STRESS. BEES ARE AN IDEAL SYSTEM TO PROBE THE MECHANISTIC UNDERPINNINGS OF EXTREME DIFFERENCES IN LIFESPAN, YIELDING GENERAL INSIGHT INTO REGULATORS OF AGING. BEE LIFE-CYCLES ARE SHORT COMPARED TO VERTEBRATES AND ITS POSSIBLE TO EXAMINE LIFETIME PATTERNS OF SENESCENCE. AND, MANY ASPECTS OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE ARE CONSERVED ACROSS INSECTS AND VERTEBRATES. INVESTIGATING HOW AGING DYNAMICS DIFFER AMONG SPECIES MAY LEAD TO NEW WAYS OF DISRUPTING NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF AGING.

INSECT OVERWINTERING, ALSO KNOWN AS DIAPAUSE, ALSO HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR AGING. DIAPAUSE INCREASES LIFESPANS BY SIX TIMES COMPARED TO NON-DIAPAUSING INDIVIDUALS. THIS RESEARCH WILL DETERMINE HOW METAMORPHOSIS AND DIAPAUSE CONTRIBUTE TO AGING DYNAMICS BY EXAMINING CELLULAR DAMAGE AND ORGANISMAL PERFORMANCE BY: 1) DETERMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SENESCENCE AND CELLULAR MARKERS OF AGING, 2) EXAMINING HOW THE DISPOSABLE SOMA DURING METAMORPHOSIS INFLUENCES AGING BY COMPARING CELLULAR AGING IN TISSUES FORMED DURING METAMORPHOSIS TO THOSE CARRIED OVER FROM THE LARVAL STAGE, AND 3) ASSESSING WHETHER OVERWINTERING DORMANCY IS A SLOWING DOWN OF AGING OR IS REGENERATIVE.

OTHER HYPOTHESES PREDICT THE OPPOSITE: TISSUES RELATED TO REPRODUCTION WILL AGE FASTER BECAUSE OF SELECTION FOR EARLY LIFE FITNESS. THIS RESEARCH WILL EXAMINE AGING DYNAMICS ACROSS LIFE STAGES AND TISSUES, AND IN RESPONSE TO STRESS. BEES ARE AN IDEAL SYSTEM TO PROBE THE MECHANISTIC UNDERPINNINGS OF EXTREME DIFFERENCES IN LIFESPAN, YIELDING GENERAL INSIGHT INTO REGULATORS OF AGING. BEE LIFE-CYCLES ARE SHORT COMPARED TO VERTEBRATES AND ITS POSSIBLE TO EXAMINE LIFETIME PATTERNS OF SENESCENCE. AND, MANY ASPECTS OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE ARE CONSERVED ACROSS INSECTS AND VERTEBRATES. INVESTIGATING HOW AGING DYNAMICS DIFFER AMONG SPECIES MAY LEAD TO NEW WAYS OF DISRUPTING NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF AGING. UNDERSTANDING AGING IS PARTICULARLY PRESSING IN A WORLD IN WHICH ORGANISMS ARE INCREASINGLY EXPOSED TO STRESS AND MANY BEE SPECIES ARE IN DECLINE.

THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE WAS SO HOT THAT PROTONS AND NEUTRONS DID NOT EXIST. INSTEAD, A DENSE SOUP OF QUARKS AND GLUONS, THE FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES THAT MAKE UP THE PROTON AND NEUTRON AND INTERACT BY THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE, EXISTED. THIS STATE OF MATTER HAS BEEN RECREATED IN THE COLLISIONS OF HEAVY NUCLEI, LIKE GOLD, AT THE RELATIVISTIC HEAVY ION COLLIDER (RHIC) AT BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY.

USING SPHENIX AU+AU AND P+P DATA, HADRON-JET AZIMUTHAL CORRELATIONS WILL BE MEASURED. DEPENDING ON HOW THE JETS ARE BINNED, THESE CORRELATIONS CAN BE SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF PARTON ENERGY LOSS IN A QUARK-GLUON PLASMA (QGP). THESE MEASUREMENTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH LUMINOSITY OF RHIC AND HIGH DAQ RATE OF SPHENIX TO HAVE A LARGE SAMPLE OF JETS TO STUDY THE TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF THE QGP AT RHIC. THE PI AND STUDENTS PLAN TO INCREASE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN EPIC. THE GROUP WILL WORK ALONGSIDE COLLABORATORS DOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK FOR HOMOGENEOUS ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETERS FOR THE CENTRAL RAPIDITY BARREL OR THE ELECTRON-GOING BACKWARD RAPIDITY ARM. THE GROUP PLANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE JEFFERSON LAB TEST BEAM CAMPAIGN. DEEP INELASTIC E+A COLLISIONS AT THE EIC CAN PROBE A REGION WHICH MAY BE WHERE GLUON SATURATION DOMINATES GLUON KINEMATICS.

ALTHOUGH THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THESE FIBERS IS KNOWN, IDENTIFICATION OF THE PROTEINS THAT BIND DNA AND HOW THE PROTEINS AND DNA ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE FIBERS ARE POINTS OF INVESTIGATION FOR THIS STUDY. THE OVERALL GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY WHICH PROTEINS IN THE FIBERS BIND DNA AND HOW, TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS CRITICAL TO THE PROCESS OF ASSEMBLING BACTERIAL BIOFILMS. AS A RESULT, THIS PROJECT WILL ADVANCE THE FIELD OF BACTERIOLOGY AS WELL AS TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE USE OF QUANTITATIVE AND STRUCTURAL METHODS FOR MICROBIOLOGY. EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS CENTERED ON MICROBIAL FITNESS AND COMMUNITIES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND SHARED WITH LOCAL HS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS THROUGH EXISTING UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS, A WORKSHOP AND A SUMMER CAMP.

A NEW PROMISING PARADIGM, CALLED QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE (QIS), TAKES ADVANTAGE OF MICROSCOPIC QUANTUM STATES, FOR INSTANCE SPINS OF ELECTRONS, TO ENCODE INFORMATION. COUNTERINTUITIVE QUANTUM EFFECTS, SUCH AS SUPERPOSITION AND QUANTUM CORRELATION CALLED ENTANGLEMENT, ENABLE US TO PROCESS INFORMATION WITH SHADES OF GRAY BEYOND THE CONVENTIONAL BLACK-OR-WHITE (SO-CALLED 0-OR-1) LOGIC, AND TO ATTAIN DRASTIC IMPROVEMENTS OVER CONVENTIONAL DEVICES. THE PROGRESS OF QIS ALSO ENABLES US TO START MANIPULATING QUANTUM MANY-BODY SYSTEMS AND UTILIZING ARTIFICIALLY SYNTHETIC QUANTUM SYSTEMS FOR QUANTUM COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION. WHILE QUANTUM CONTROL OF THE REGISTER OF SEVERAL QUBITS IS FEASIBLE IN SEVERAL PHYSICAL ARCHITECTURES, THERE REMAIN FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES, INCLUDING HOW TO BUILD MACROSCOPIC ENTANGLEMENT ROBUSTLY WITH WELL-SCALABLE CONTROL, AND HOW TO ACHIEVE QUANTUM SIMULATION OF COMPLEX QUANTUM SYSTEMS BEYOND POSSIBLE CLASSICAL SIMULATION. IT HAS BEEN RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT STRONGLY FRUSTRATED QUANTUM SPIN SYSTEMS WHICH MANIFEST CERTAIN SYMMETRIES AND TOPOLOGICAL PHENOMENA POSSESS INTRINSIC CAPABILITY AS A QUANTUM COMPUTER. THROUGH THIS CONCRETE EXAMPLE, THE PROJECT SEEKS A DEEP CONNECTION BETWEEN MACROSCOPIC QUANTUM ORDERS AND QUANTUM ADVANTAGE IN COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION, BY UTILIZING MID-CIRCUIT MEASUREMENTS WHICH EMERGE AS NEW CAPACITY OF NOISY INTERMEDIATE-SCALE QUANTUM (NISQ) PROTOTYPE COMPUTERS. IN A GENERAL SENSE, THE RESEARCH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO PROMOTE THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE, PRIMARILY THE KNOWLEDGE BASE OF QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE, AND TO TRAIN FUTURE SCIENTISTS IN THIS HIGHLY INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD. A FUNDAMENTAL INTERPLAY BETWEEN ENTANGLEMENT AND MEASUREMENT LIES AT THE HEART OF QIS.

FROM BELL?S THEOREM ON NONLOCALITY (OR MORE GENERALLY CONTEXTUALITY) TO RECENT QUANTUM SIMULATIONS OF THE BOSON-SAMPLING PROBLEM, MOST LANDMARK RESULTS OF QIS HAVE RELIED UPON INNOVATIVE MEANS OF BALANCING THESE TWO CONTRASTING INGREDIENTS TO GREAT PRACTICAL EFFECT. THE FRAMEWORK OF MEASUREMENT-BASED QUANTUM COMPUTATION (MBQC) IS CONVENIENT TO STUDY SUCH AN INTERPLAY AND THE ORIGIN OF QUANTUM SPEED-UP IN COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION. ON ONE HAND, A SYMMETRY-PROTECTED TOPOLOGICAL ORDER (SPTO), SUCH AS THE GROUND STATES OF QUANTUM SPIN SYSTEMS WITH GEOMETRICALLY FRUSTRATED INTERACTIONS WHICH EXHIBIT EXOTIC MAGNETISM OF QUANTUM SPIN LIQUID, NOT ONLY REALIZES MANY-BODY ENTANGLEMENT OF INTEREST BUT ALSO HAS BEEN A RECENT TARGET OF QUANTUM SIMULATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, MID-CIRCUIT MEASUREMENTS EMERGE AS NEW CAPACITY OF NISQ COMPUTERS. WHILE IT IS WIDELY KNOWN THAT MID-CIRCUIT MEASUREMENTS AND ADAPTATIONS BASED ON MEASUREMENT OUTCOMES ARE CRUCIAL FOR QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION, IT IS LESS UNDERSTOOD HOW MEASUREMENTS CAN EMPOWER QUANTUM COMPUTATION, PARTICULARLY WHEN QUANTUM RESOURCES ARE LIMITED AS IN THE NISQ ERA. THE PROJECT DEEPENS UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCENARIOS FOR QUANTUM COMPUTATIONAL ADVANTAGE, BY EXTENDING A CLASS OF MANY-BODY ENTANGLEMENT THROUGH SPTO, CONTEXTUAL OBSERVABLES OF MEASUREMENTS, AND CAUSAL RELATIONS AMONG MEASUREMENTS. BROADLY, THE PROJECT CROSS-FERTILIZES FURTHER TWO RESEARCH FIELDS, QIS AND QUANTUM MANY-BODY PHYSICS, TIMELY AT THE COMING AGE OF QUANTUM SIMULATION WHEN QUANTUM MANY-BODY PHYSICS SUGGESTS MANY PROBLEMS WHICH QUANTUM COMPUTERS SHOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT TO SOLVE THAN CONVENTIONAL COMPUTERS.

FIRST, LARGE-SAMPLE ANALYSES INVOLVE INTEGRATING MULTIPLE RESTRICTED-USE DATA SOURCES AVAILABLE VIA THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU?S FEDERAL STATISTICAL RESEARCH DATA CENTERS/FSRDC TO CONSTRUCT A LONGITUDINAL DATABASE SPANNING MORE THAN TWO DECADES: DECENNIAL CENSUS, AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY, DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS? AFFAIRS U.S. VETERANS FILE, NATIONAL SURVEY OF COLLEGE GRADUATES; PLUS PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE DATA FROM THE INTEGRATED POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION DATA SYSTEM. THESE ANALYSES INVOLVE SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL MODELS ON LARGE SAMPLES BASED ON MILLIONS OF RESPONDENTS IN THE FSRDC DATABASES. METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS INVOLVE CREATING NEW POPULATION ESTIMATES SOUGHT BY THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES, PLUS CONDUCTING ESSENTIAL ROBUSTNESS CHECKS THAT TEST SEVERAL DISTINCT STEM DEFINITIONS USED BY FEDERAL AGENCIES. SECOND, TO EXAMINE THE MECHANISMS THAT SHAPE SUCH TRAJECTORIES OF CIVILIAN AND VETERAN STUDENTS, THE PROJECT RELIES ON ORIGINAL SURVEY DATA FOR A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF CURRENT STUDENTS AT A MAJOR US UNIVERSITY. THIS ORIGINAL SURVEY COMPENSATES FOR LIMITATIONS IN THE FSRDC DATA BY HOMING IN ON THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIC SKILLS AND EXPERIENCES, INCLUDING THOSE OF STUDENT VETERANS. THE SURVEY DATA ARE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VIA A DATA REPOSITORY, TO ENHANCE SOCIAL SCIENCE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE, DISSEMINATION, AND TRANSPARENCY.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO HARNESS HHG TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CHEMISTRY OF TRANSITION METAL COMPOUNDS, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL IN VARIOUS CHEMICAL PROCESSES AND HAVE EXTENSIVE INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. TRANSITION METAL COMPOUNDS HAVE INTRIGUING PROPERTIES, PARTLY DUE TO THEIR COMPLEX ELECTRONIC STRUCTURES. BY EXPLORING THE HHG SPECTRA OF TRANSITION METAL COMPOUNDS, THIS RESEARCH CONTRIBUTES TO ADVANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE MATERIALS, WHICH CAN HAVE WIDE-RANGING IMPLICATIONS FOR INNOVATIONS IN CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE.

WHEN MANY OF THE OUTER ELECTRONS ARE REMOVED FROM AN ATOM, IT BECOMES A HIGHLY CHARGED ION. SUCH HIGHLY CHARGED IONS (HCI) ARE INTERESTING AS THEY HAVE EXOTIC PROPERTIES COMPARED TO NEUTRAL ATOMS. IN THESE IONS, THE REMAINING ELECTRONS ARE THOSE THAT OVERLAP SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE SMALL CENTRAL NUCLEUS. PRECISION MEASUREMENTS OF THE LIGHT EMITTED AS THE ELECTRONS CHANGE ORBITS THUS YIELDS INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUCLEUS. THESE INCLUDE THE FINITE NUCLEAR CHARGE RADIUS, NUCLEAR DEFORMATIONS, AND MAGNETIC PROPERTIES. USING AN ELECTRON BEAM ION TRAP (EBIT), THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF HCI CHOSEN TO HAVE SIMPLE, THEORETICALLY CALCULABLE ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND NUCLEAR EFFECTS. BY MEASURING THE EMITTED RADIATION IN THE EXTREME-ULTRAVIOLET (EUV) AND X-RAY REGION, THE PIS AND THEIR COLLABORATORS RECENTLY CONDUCTED A SERIES OF BENCHMARK EXPERIMENTS USING NA-LIKE AND MG-LIKE IONS AND DETERMINED THE NUCLEAR CHARGE RADII DIFFERENCES OF HIGH-Z ISOTOPES. IN THE PRESENT PROJECT, THEY WILL EXPAND THESE STUDIES, INVESTIGATE ITS LIMITATIONS, AND EXPLORE ITS SENSITIVITY TO BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL (BSM) PHYSICS. THE STUDY WILL ALSO BE USED TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING ATOMIC THEORIES OF COMPLEX ATOMIC SYSTEMS.

THE RESEARCH WORK WILL INTEGRATE WITH THE INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TAKEN BY THE STUDENTS SUCH AS THE ?CREATIVE INQUIRY? PROGRAM AT CLEMSON UNIVERSITY AND THE ?METHODS OF EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS? AT APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY. STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO JOIN THE RESEARCH WORK AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BE TRAINED TO MENTOR UNDERGRADUATES. ONLY A FEW METHODS EXIST TO MEASURE THE ABSOLUTE NUCLEAR CHARGE RADIUS, WHICH IS A KEY PROPERTY OF THE NUCLEUS THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE ONSET OF NUCLEAR DEFORMATION, THE STRUCTURE OF EXOTIC HALO NUCLEI, AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NUCLEONS. IN ASTROPHYSICS, THE NUCLEAR CHARGE RADIUS ENTERS IN THE DETERMINATION OF STELLAR ELEMENTAL ABUNDANCES AND IS AN IMPORTANT PARAMETER IN DARK MATTER SEARCHES. ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY OF NA-LIKE AND MG-LIKE HCI IN AN EBIT OFFERS A NEW METHOD TO PURSUE THE MEASUREMENT OF ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE NUCLEAR CHARGE RADII THAT SUPPLEMENT ONLY A HANDFUL OF AVAILABLE NUCLEAR AND ATOMIC PHYSICS-BASED TECHNIQUES. IN ADDITION TO THE STRONG ELECTRON-NUCLEAR OVERLAP, RELATIVISTIC AND QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS (QED) EFFECTS ARE ALSO MORE PRONOUNCED IN HIGH-Z IONS COMPARED TO NEUTRAL ATOMS OR FEW-TIMES IONIZED SYSTEMS. THE EXPERIMENTAL PRECISION PROVIDED BY THE SPECTROMETER RESOLUTION AND HIGH STATISTICS OF THE NA/MG-LIKE SYSTEMS COMPLEMENTED BY HIGHLY ACCURATE STATE-OF-THE-ART AB-INITIO CALCULATIONS THUS ALLOWS FOR THE STUDY OF ATOMIC STRUCTURE EFFECTS SUCH AS HYPERFINE SPLITTING, NUCLEAR DEFORMATION, NUCLEAR POLARIZATION, AND HIGHER-ORDER QED. THE EXPERIMENT WILL MEASURE THE ISOTOPE SHIFT BETWEEN ISOTOPES WITH SOME OF THE SMALLEST NUCLEAR CHARGE RADIUS UNCERTAINTIES SUCH AS TUNGSTEN AND OSMIUM, SERVING AS IDEAL CANDIDATES TO TEST THE LIMITS OF THE TECHNIQUE AND TO LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF BSM EFFECTS. NUCLEAR CHARGE RADII OF ISOTOPES WITH A LARGE UNCERTAINTY SUCH AS RHENIUM WILL BE CONDUCTED USING OSMIUM AS AN ANCHOR.

THIS PROJECT WILL EXPLORE NEW WAYS TO STUDY THE NATURE OF DARK MATTER, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST PUZZLING SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE RESEARCH IS TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF DEARLY NEEDED THEORETICAL RESULTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PROGRESS IN ATOM-BASED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE A NEW FRONTIER IN SEARCHES FOR NEW PHYSICS. THE TOOLS THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED, ESPECIALLY IN UNDERSTANDING ATOMIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS AND THEORETICAL CONCEPTS RELATED TO NEW PHYSICS MODELS AND HOW TO BENCHMARK THEM, WILL HAVE FAR-REACHING USE FOR THE COMMUNITY.

THE PROJECT WILL SPEARHEAD A NEW GENERATION OF ATOMIC PRECISION MEASUREMENTS AIMED AT SEARCHES FOR PHYSICS BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON DARK MATTER (DM) SEARCHES. IT WAS PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED THAT THE RATIO OF THE OPTICAL ATOMIC CLOCKS IS ONLY SENSITIVE TO PHOTON-DM COUPLING VIA THE VARIATION OF THE FINE-STRUCTURE CONSTANT. THIS PROJECT WILL EXPLORE ADDITIONAL SENSITIVITIES OF OPTICAL CLOCKS TO THE HADRONIC SECTOR DUE TO THE OSCILLATION OF THE CHARGE RADIUS. MOREOVER, THE CLOCKS ARE SENSITIVE NOT ONLY TO SCALAR DARK MATTER BUT ALSO TO HIGHLY MOTIVATED PSEUDO-SCALAR AXION AND AXION-LIKE (APL) PARTICLES. EXPLOITING SENSITIVITIES TO THESE HADRONIC DM COUPLINGS REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIELD SHIFT CONSTANTS THAT CAN BE COMPUTED WITH THE METHODS THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT. THE PI WILL EXPLORE THE SENSITIVITIES OF DIFFERENT CLOCKS, INCLUDING HIGHLY CHARGED IONS, TO THESE NEW EFFECTS. THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO (1) DEVELOP NEW PARADIGMS FOR THE DETECTION OF ULTRALIGHT DARK MATTER (UDM) WITH QUANTUM SENSORS, (2) DEVELOP THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPECIFIC UDM MODELS, AND (3) DEVELOP METHODS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE PRECISION OF THE ATOMIC THEORY NEEDED FOR THE DESIGN AND INTERPRETATION OF EXPERIMENTS.

IN MOST CASES THESE ATOMS ARE CONTROLLED BY LASER LIGHT DIRECTED THROUGH THE CHAMBER?S WINDOWS AND ARE MONITORED BY DETECTING THE LIGHT THE ATOMS EMIT. WHEN THE ATOMIC IONS ARE BROUGHT CLOSE TO SOLID SURFACES, THEY CAN EXHIBIT NEW BEHAVIOR THAT COULD REMOVE THE NEED FOR THE LASERS, ALLOWING QUANTUM CONTROL TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY ELECTRONICALLY, WHICH COULD VASTLY SIMPLIFY EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS. THE PI AND HIS UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH STUDENTS WILL STUDY THE INTERACTIONS OF A SINGLE TRAPPED ATOMIC ION WITH A NEARBY VIBRATING PIEZOELECTRIC CRYSTAL (PIEZO). THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL IS COMMONLY USED IN SENSORS TO MEASURE SMALL FORCES OR DISPLACEMENTS BY CONVERTING THEM DIRECTLY INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS. THIS APPLICATION COULD BE ENHANCED BY QUANTUM SENSING TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO A NEARBY TRAPPED ION IF THE ION-PIEZO INTERACTIONS WERE WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE RESEARCH GROUP WILL MEASURE THE DEPENDENCE OF THE INTERACTION ON SEVERAL PARAMETERS, INCLUDING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE IONS AND THE CRYSTAL, AND THE VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCY OF THE LEVITATED TRAPPED ION, AND WILL COMPARE THE RESULTS TO A THEORETICAL MODEL. GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN EXPERIMENT AND THEORY WILL MOTIVATE FOLLOW-UP EXPERIMENTS SEEKING TO CONTROL THE IONS WITH THE CRYSTAL AND EVENTUALLY TO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT QUANTUM ENHANCED PIEZO SENSORS. MUCH OF THE EXPERIMENT, FROM APPARATUS DESIGN AND BUILDING TO DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS, WILL BE PERFORMED BY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, HELPING THEM DEVELOP SKILLS NECESSARY FOR GRADUATE STUDIES AND CAREERS IN THE BURGEONING FIELD OF QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE PI WILL EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF A BULK PIEZOELECTRIC RESONATOR COUPLING TO THE MOTION OF TRAPPED ATOMIC IONS. THE EXPERIMENT WILL CONSIST OF A SINGLY IONIZED YTTERBIUM (YB) ATOM, STABLY CONFINED BY A RADIOFREQUENCY (RF) ION TRAP, PLACED IN PROXIMITY TO A BULK LEAD ZIRCONATE TITANATE PIEZOELECTRIC RESONATOR (PIEZO) WITHIN AN ULTRA-HIGH VACUUM CHAMBER. WITH THE PIEZO AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, THE COUPLING SHOULD MANIFEST ITSELF AS AN INCREASED HEATING RATE OF THE ION?S MOTION WHEN ON RESONANCE WITH THE PIEZO'S MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS. BY PERFORMING THERMOMETRY MEASUREMENTS ON THE TRAPPED ION, THE RESEARCH TEAM CAN INFER THE STRENGTH OF THIS COUPLING AS A FUNCTION OF PIEZO-ION DISTANCE BY MOVING THE PIEZO ON AN IN-VACUUM TRANSLATION STAGE. CRYSTALS OF TRAPPED ATOMIC YB IONS HAVE PROVEN TO BE AN IDEAL PLATFORM FOR ENGINEERING COMPLEX QUANTUM SYSTEMS, WHERE THE COULOMB REPULSION BETWEEN IONS CAN BE USED TO GENERATE ENTANGLEMENT WITHIN A CRYSTAL USING COHERENT LASER INTERACTIONS. HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH HAS FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO SCALE THE ION NUMBERS PAST CURRENT LIMITS; A PROBLEM WHICH A CONTROLLED PIEZO-ION COUPLING COULD HELP SOLVE. FOR INSTANCE, A PIEZO COULD BE BUILT INTO AN OPTOMECHANICAL CAVITY TO FORM A QUANTUM TRANSDUCER, IMPRINTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE ION'S MOTION INTO THE FREQUENCY MODULATION OF A LASER BEAM AND MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR LONG-DISTANCE TRANSMISSION. IN ADDITION, PIEZOELECTRIC MATERIALS SEE WIDE USE AS MECHANICAL SENSORS, AND THE ABILITY TO COUPLE A PIEZO AND ION CRYSTAL COULD LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT OF ENHANCED QUANTUM SENSING TECHNIQUES FOR PIEZO READOUT. THE PIEZO AGAIN SERVES AS A TRANSDUCER, TRANSFORMING MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS INTO ELECTRICAL VIBRATIONS TO WHICH TRAPPED IONS ARE EXQUISITELY SENSITIVE.

COMPLEX PLASMAS, ALSO KNOWN AS DUSTY PLASMAS, ARE COLLECTIONS OF MICRON-SIZED DUST PARTICLES IMMERSED IN A PLASMA, OR IONIZED GAS. THE DUST GRAINS TYPICALLY BECOME CHARGED BY COLLECTING ELECTRONS AND IONS ON THEIR SURFACE. WHEN DUSTY PLASMAS ARE PLACED IN EXTERNAL ELECTRIC FIELDS, ANISOTROPIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DUST GRAINS AND ION FLOWS CAN LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF FILAMENTARY DUST STRUCTURES. ANISOTROPIC INTERACTIONS, WHICH DEPEND ON THE RELATIVE ORIENTATION OF INTERACTING PARTICLES, ARE KNOWN TO ARISE IN SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING COMPLEX SYSTEMS, INCLUDING PROTEINS AND SMART MATERIALS. A FUNDAMENTAL OPEN QUESTION IN THE STUDY OF THESE SYSTEMS IS HOW ANISOTROPIC INTERACTIONS LEAD TO STRUCTURE FORMATION. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THIS QUESTION USING A COMBINED ANALYTICAL, NUMERICAL, AND EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE HOW ANISOTROPIC INTERACTIONS LEAD TO STRUCTURE FORMATION IN DUSTY PLASMA EXPERIMENTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS). THE PROJECT IS JOINTLY FUNDED BY THE DIVISION OF PHYSICS AND THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR). THIS PROJECT WILL USE DATA FROM SEVERAL PK-4 CAMPAIGNS TO INVESTIGATE THE FORM AND ORIGINS OF THE ANISOTROPIC DUST-DUST INTERACTION POTENTIAL THAT LEADS TO THE FORMATION OF FILAMENTARY DUSTY PLASMA STRUCTURES. DATA COLLECTED FROM PK-4 EXPERIMENTS WILL BE USED TO QUANTIFY STRUCTURAL ANISOTROPY AS A FUNCTION OF PLASMA CONDITIONS USING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA-DRIVEN METHODS.

THE WHITE RIVER ASH (WRA) DACITE TEPHRA BEDS FOUND IN EASTERN ALASKA AND WESTERN CANADA RESULTED FROM THREE OF THE MOST EXPLOSIVE ERUPTIONS (VEI 6) FROM A NORTH AMERICAN VOLCANO, MT CHURCHILL, IN THE PAST ~2000 YEARS. THOSE ERUPTIONS HARMED THE INDIGENOUS DENE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE AREAS DOWNWIND IN PRESENT DAY CANADA, RESULTING IN A SOUTHWARD MIGRATION OUT OF THE IMPACTED AREA. THE CURRENT GLOBAL REACH OF AIR TRAFFIC AND THE INCREASED HUMAN POPULATION IN DOWNWIND REGIONS TODAY MEAN THAT A SIMILAR-SIZED ERUPTION FROM MT CHURCHILL COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE CATASTROPHIC ECONOMIC AND HUMAN IMPACTS. DESPITE ITS POTENTIAL HAZARDS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SOURCE OF ITS EXPLOSIVE, SILICIC MAGMAS. THIS STUDY WILL HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE THE MAGMAS THAT FEED MT CHURCHILL?S ERUPTIONS ARE STORED IN THE CRUST. ALTHOUGH THIS VOLCANO DOES NOT HAVE A DEDICATED SEISMIC MONITORING NETWORK, KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE THE MAGMAS LIVE BENEATH THE VOLCANO CAN HELP US BETTER ESTIMATE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THE VOLCANO BECOMES RESTLESS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

IF REACTED AMPHIBOLES ARE FOUND, TEXTURAL ANALYSIS WILL ENABLE THE TEAM TO ESTIMATE MAGMA ASCENT RATES USING PRIOR EXPERIMENTAL CALIBRATIONS. THE PETROLOGY OF THE WRA TEPHRA IS WELL-SUITED FOR PHASE EQUILIBRIA EXPERIMENTS, AND THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE RANGE CONSTRAINED BY PRIOR WORK ALLOWS FOR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS THAT ARE SUITABLE FOR STUDENT WORK AND HAVE A RELATIVELY LOW FAILURE RATE. THE EXPERIMENTS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A MAGMA PLUMBING SYSTEM MODEL FOR THE WRA ERUPTIONS FROM MT CHURCHILL.

APPLICATIONS OF GRAPHICAL MODELS INCLUDE CLASSIFICATION AND EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS IN FINANCE, SOCIAL NETWORKS, ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORKS, GENE REGULATORY NETWORKS, AND FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI). HOWEVER, GRAPHS ARE NOT ALWAYS EXPLICITLY AVAILABLE. THEREFORE, GIVEN DATA, LEARNING THE UNDERLYING GRAPH STRUCTURE IS CENTRAL TO APPLICATIONS IN MACHINE LEARNING AND SIGNAL PROCESSING. IN THE LITERATURE, IT IS TYPICALLY ASSUMED THAT THE TEMPORAL DATA CONSISTS OF MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT REALIZATIONS OF A RANDOM VECTOR OR MATRIX IN THE CHOICE OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION TO BE OPTIMIZED AS WELL AS IN ALGORITHM DESIGN AND ANALYSIS. THIS ASSUMPTION IS OFTEN VIOLATED IN PRACTICE. THIS PROJECT EXPLICITLY CONSIDERS TIME-DEPENDENT DATA, WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY DETAILED PARAMETRIC MODELING TO CAPTURE TIME DEPENDENCIES.

THE PROJECT WILL IMPROVE THE MODELING AND PREDICTING CAPABILITIES FOR ROGUE WAVES, INTEGRABLE TURBULENCE, PROPAGATION OF COHERENT STRUCTURES IN NOISY MEDIA, TIDAL WAVES, AND METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA (I.E., MORNING GLORY). THE PROJECT WILL ALSO OFFER RESEARCH AND MENTORING OPPORTUNITIES AT BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE LEVELS. RECRUITMENT EFFORTS WILL BE MINDFUL TO BROADEN RESEARCH PARTICIPATION IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE, AS WELL AS TARGET STUDENTS INTENDING TO BECOME HIGH SCHOOL MATHEMATICS TEACHERS. THE PROJECT STUDIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE KORTEWEG-DE VRIES EQUATION THE EFFECT THAT INITIAL DATA WITH SLOWER DECAY (OR NO DECAY) AT SPATIAL PLUS INFINITY HAVE ON THE SOLUTIONS OF COMPLETELY INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS, THAT IS PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS THAT CAN BE SOLVED AND ANALYZED BY MEANS OF THE INVERSE SCATTERING TRANSFORM (IST). APPROACHING THE CASE OF SLOWER DECAY AT PLUS INFINITY PRESENTS SEVERE MATHEMATICAL CHALLENGES IN THE APPLICATIONS OF THE IST, AND ITS STUDY IS A MAJOR UNSOLVED OPEN QUESTION. PREDICTING LONG-TIME BEHAVIOR OF THE SOLUTIONS IS DIFFICULT, AS THE WELL-KNOWN POWERFUL RIEMANN-HILBERT MACHINERY BREAKS DOWN ON SUCH INITIAL PROFILES. THE MAIN EFFORT OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE DEVOTED TO EXTENDING THE RIEMANN-HILBERT METHOD OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF CLASSICAL SITUATIONS. THE INVESTIGATOR PLANS TO USE THE METHODS OF HANKEL OPERATORS TO TACKLE THE ARISING ISSUES AND EXPECTS TO DISCOVER NEW TYPES OF SOLUTIONS, WITH MORE COMPLICATED WAVE STRUCTURE, IN CONTRAST TO THE SIMPLICITY OF EXISTING SOLITONS AND RADIATION, OR PERIODIC (QUASI-PERIODIC) WAVE TRAINS AND THEIR MODULATIONS. THE RESULTS WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR APPLICATIONS AND BE RELEVANT TO THE THEORY OF THE SCHRODINGER OPERATOR, THE CORNERSTONE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS, AND THE THEORY OF HANKEL AND TOEPLITZ OPERATORS, FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTS OF OPERATOR THEORY.

HOWEVER, DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANCE AND SEVERAL DECADES OF OBSERVATIONAL AND THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION, THE DETAILED NATURE OF THE STELLAR SYSTEMS THAT GIVE RISE TO THESE EXPLOSIONS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. A RESEARCH TEAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA TUSCALOOSA WILL USE COMPUTER-BASED NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS TO INVESTIGATE ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING CANDIDATE SCENARIOS FOR A SN IA EXPLOSION. THIS SCENARIO, CALLED THE ?DOUBLE-DETONATION? MECHANISM, STARTS WITH AN EXPLOSIVE HELIUM DETONATION ON THE SURFACE OF A HIGHLY COMPACT WHITE DWARF STAR, WHICH IN TURN YIELDS A CARBON-BURNING DETONATION IN THE CORE OF THAT STAR. THE RESEARCH WILL INVOLVE THE TRAINING OF GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC SOFTWARE.

IN ORDER FOR THIS SCENARIO TO BE VIABLE AS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO SNE IA, THE IGNITION PROCESS MUST NOT JUST BE POSSIBLE UNDER FINE-TUNING, BUT ROBUST AND ALMOST UNIVERSAL. SECONDLY, BASED ON RECENT SIMULATIONS, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE DETAILED STRUCTURE OF THE OUTER LAYERS OF THE EXPLODING STAR AND THE PRESENCE OF THE COMPANION STAR ARE CRITICAL TO DETERMINING WHETHER THE RESULTING SUPERNOVA MATCHES THOSE OBSERVED.

THE POSSIBILITY THAT A MATHEMATICAL MODEL DOES NOT CAPTURE THE FULL RANGE OF POSSIBLE REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS IS CONCERNING IF THE PREDICTIONS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR EXTREME EVENTS. MATHEMATICALLY, THIS MAY OCCUR IF THE MODEL IS UNSTABLE. THIS CAN BE EVIDENT THROUGH A BUTTERFLY EFFECT, IN WHICH A SEEMINGLY NEGLIGIBLE CHANGE IN A PARAMETER LEADS TO A WILDLY DIFFERENT OUTCOME. EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS THE SPECTER OF NON-UNIQUENESS, IN WHICH THE SAME SET OF PARAMETERS MAY GENERATE DIFFERENT DYNAMICS. CONSEQUENTLY, A SIMULATION COULD ACCURATELY DESCRIBE ONE REAL-WORLD SCENARIO BUT NOT ACCOUNT FOR ANOTHER POSSIBLY CATASTROPHIC ONE. IN THIS PROJECT, THE INVESTIGATOR WILL DEVELOP A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF THE POSSIBLE SEVERITY OF THESE UNSTABLE DYNAMICS. STUDENTS WILL BE INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT. THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE OUTREACH EFFORTS TO PROMOTE MATHEMATICS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE INVESTIGATOR WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOW RAPIDLY SOLUTIONS TO PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS CAN AND POSSIBLY MUST SEPARATE, PRIMARILY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS, A SYSTEM WHICH MODELS VISCOUS INCOMPRESSIBLE FLUID FLOW. RECENT RESULTS SUGGEST NON-UNIQUENESS FOR THIS SYSTEM IN PHYSICAL CLASSES OF SOLUTIONS. TO ASSESS THE SEVERITY OF NON-UNIQUENESS, ESTIMATES WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE DIFFERENCE OF TWO SOLUTIONS HAVING THE SAME INITIAL DATA.

WHEN PEOPLE AGE AND THEIR MUSCLE FUNCTIONS DECLINE, IT CAN LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO GENERATE ENOUGH ANKLE PUSH-OFF POWER TO WALK NORMALLY. MOBILITY-CHALLENGED OLDER ADULTS OFTEN WALK UNNATURALLY AND INEFFICIENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY MAY COMPENSATE FOR REDUCED ANKLE PUSH-OFF ACTION BY OVERUSING THE HIP. THIS BEHAVIOR NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE LONG-TERM HEALTH OF THE RELATED LEG JOINTS, BUT ALSO CAUSES ACCELERATED DECLINE OF PHYSICAL MOBILITY. SUCH MOBILITY DECLINE HAS PROFOUND IMPACTS ON OLDER ADULTS? LIFESTYLES, AS WELL AS THEIR LONG-TERM PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. AS WALKING SPEED DECREASES, AN ELDERLY INDIVIDUAL MAY EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED DIFFICULTIES IN HIS/HER DAILY ACTIVITIES (E.G., BEING UNABLE TO CROSS A BUSY STREET BEFORE THE LIGHT CHANGES). WHEN WALKING BECOMES MORE STRENUOUS, AN OLDER ADULT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE PHYSICALLY INACTIVE AND SUFFER FROM THE MULTIPLE HEALTH PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE (HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OBESITY, DEPRESSION, ETC.). MOTIVATED BY THIS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE, OUR RESEARCH IN THIS PROJECT WILL BE DEDICATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW ROBOTIC ANKLE-FOOT ORTHOSIS (EXOSKELETON) SYSTEM TO ASSIST THE USER?S ANKLE MOVEMENT WHEN WALKING IN REAL-WORLD ENVIRONMENTS.

ONE SUCH TRADE-OFF IS THAT SPECIES THAT ARE BETTER AT AVOIDING PREDATORS ARE OFTEN POORER COMPETITORS. LIKEWISE, SPECIES THAT ARE STRONG COMPETITORS ARE OFTEN BAD AT AVOIDING PREDATORS. THIS TRADE-OFF HELPS MAINTAIN BIODIVERSITY IN COMMUNITIES SINCE IT PREVENTS ANY ONE SPECIES FROM DOMINATING. HOWEVER, COMPETITION AND PREDATION ARE SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE AND NOT ALL SPECIES MAY RESPOND IDENTICALLY TO WARMING. CONSEQUENTLY, THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN COMPETITION AND PREDATOR AVOIDANCE MAY CHANGE IN A WARMING CLIMATE. ALTERING THIS TRADE-OFF MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY AND CRITICAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES.

POLYMERS THAT CONTAIN LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER, LIKE CONTACT LENSES, ARE CALLED HYDROGELS. ONE USE OF HYDROGELS INVOLVES PLACING THESE MATERIALS INTO THE BODY TO HELP OVERCOME A BIOLOGICAL DEFICIENCY (INJURY, DISEASE, IMPAIRMENT, ETC.). THE BODY?S RESPONSE TO THESE ?BIOMATERIALS? IS DEPENDENT UPON THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES - INCOMPATIBLE MATERIALS ARE REJECTED BY THE BODY. SIMILARLY, THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD MATCH THOSE OF THE ORIGINAL TISSUE. THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE CONTROL OVER THE BIOMATERIALS GIVEN THIS BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE A NEW CLASS OF HYDROGELS THAT PROVIDE IMPROVED CONTROL OF THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES. THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH THE CREATION OF NEW CHARGED, BUT NEUTRAL, AMINO ACID-BASED MOLECULES THAT HOLD THE HYDROGEL TOGETHER (CROSS-LINKERS). THESE SPECIES WILL REACT WITH OTHER CHARGED MONOMERS CREATING THREE-DIMENSIONAL HYDROGEL NETWORKS. IMPORTANT HYDROGEL PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE INVESTIGATED INCLUDE THE BINDING OF BIOLOGICAL SPECIES, THE DELIVERY OF BIOLOGICAL SIGNALS, THE MATERIAL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, AND THE BREAKDOWN OF THE BIOMATERIAL OVER TIME.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: THERE IS A NEED FOR NOVEL BIOADAPTABLE MATERIALS TO ADDRESS CLINICAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH BIOMEDICAL THERAPIES AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS THAT USE POLYMER-BASED MATERIALS. TO BE DEFINED AS BIOADAPTABLE, THE MATERIAL MUST MEET FOUR CRITERIA: RESISTANCE TO NONSPECIFIC PROTEIN ADSORPTION, THE ABILITY TO DELIVER SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL SIGNALING MOLECULES (PROTEINS, PEPTIDES, ETC.), TUNABLE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, AND TUNABLE DEGRADATION BEHAVIOR. POLYAMPHOLYTE BIOMATERIALS SHOW PROMISE FOR BEING DEFINED AS BIOADAPTABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR DEMONSTRATED NONFOULING BEHAVIOR, ABILITY TO DELIVER BIOACTIVE PROTEINS, MULTIPLE APPROACHES FOR CONTROLLING THEIR MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, AND TUNABLE DEGRADATION BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT LIMITATION TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THESE POLYMERS IS THE LACK OF ZWITTERIONIC CROSS-LINKER MOLECULES AND A SUBSEQUENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE CROSS-LINKER STRUCTURE AND PHYSICAL PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS THAT WILL GUIDE THEIR END USE. THE OVERALL GOAL IS TO DESIGN AND SYNTHESIZE A LIBRARY OF PEPTIDE-BASED ZWITTERIONIC CROSS-LINKERS WHICH WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO POLYAMPHOLYTE HYDROGELS TO DEVELOP STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE CROSS-LINKER SPECIES AND THE RESULTING POLYMER HYDROGELS. THIS WILL LEAD TO A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF DESIGN CRITERIA FOR THE CROSS-LINKER WHICH IN TURN WILL FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOADAPTABLE BIOMATERIAL HYDROGELS. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT MOLECULAR-LEVEL CONTROL OVER THE LENGTH, CHEMISTRY, CHARGE SPACING, CHARGE DENSITY, AND PENDANT SIDE CHAIN PRESENTATION WILL LEAD TO THE DEMONSTRATION OF BIOADAPTABLE POLYAMPHOLYTE HYDROGELS. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY SYNTHESIZING PEPTIDE-BASED CROSS-LINKERS WITH CONTROLLED STRUCTURE AND INCORPORATING THESE CROSS-LINKERS INTO POLYAMPHOLYTE HYDROGELS. HYDROGEL PERFORMANCE METRICS WILL BE EVALUATED, RESULTING IN A FUNDAMENTAL CORRELATION OF THE STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS OF POLYAMPHOLYTE HYDROGEL PERFORMANCE METRICS TO STRUCTURAL DESIGN FEATURES IN THE LIBRARY OF PEPTIDE-BASED ZWITTERIONIC CROSS-LINKERS.

THE FELLOWSHIP SUPPORTS A RESEARCH AND TRAINING PLAN FOR THE FELLOW THAT WILL INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION OF GROUPS UNDERREPRESENTED IN BIOLOGY. THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO IDENTIFY UNOBSERVED HOST-VIRUS ASSOCIATIONS, AS MANY INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF CONCERN IN HUMANS, DOMESTIC ANIMALS, AND WILDLIFE ARE CAUSED BY VIRUSES. HOWEVER, PREDICTING THESE INTERACTIONS IS CHALLENGED BY A SPARSITY OF INFORMATION ON KNOWN ASSOCIATIONS DUE TO HIGH LOGISTICAL COSTS. DEVELOPING COMPUTER-BASED MODELS TO IDENTIFY LIKELY ASSOCIATIONS CAN CUT COSTS BY FOCUSING FIELD RESEARCH EFFORTS TO TEST PREDICTED INTERACTIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL USE PREDICTIVE MODELS TO IDENTIFY ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN BATS AND VIRUSES, WHICH WILL THEN BE TESTED BY FIELD RESEARCH. THE RESEARCH RESULTS WILL PROVIDE CONFIRMATION (OR NOT) OF BAT-VIRUS ASSOCIATIONS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE PREDICTIVE MODEL. THE FELLOW WILL BROADEN PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN BIOLOGY THROUGH MENTORSHIP, A SERIES OF GRADUATE SCHOOL PREPARATION WORKSHOPS, AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH. THE FELLOW WILL COMBINE MACHINE LEARNING AND SYSTEMATIC VALIDATION FIELD AND LABORATORY STUDIES TO EXPAND THE GLOBAL BAT?VIRUS NETWORK AND TEST THE IMPORTANCE OF BAT ROOSTING ECOLOGY RELATIVE TO OTHER BAT AND VIRUS TRAITS. BATS ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST BECAUSE THEY ARE KNOWN TO HOST MANY VIRUSES OF ZOONOTIC POTENTIAL, LEADING TO INCREASED PATHOGEN SURVEILLANCE, AND SHOW INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN ROOST PREFERENCE FOR ANTHROPOGENIC STRUCTURES THAT COULD INCREASE SPILLOVER OPPORTUNITIES TO OR FROM HUMANS. THE FELLOW WILL QUANTIFY THE PROBABILITY OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BAT SPECIES AND VIRUS FAMILIES WITH LINK PREDICTION MODELS AND THEN TEST THESE PREDICTIONS AS WELL AS ASSESS INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN ASSOCIATIONS ACROSS ROOST STRUCTURE TYPE (ANTHROPOGENIC OR NATURAL) IN BATS SAMPLED IN OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS. CREATING AN ITERATIVE LOOP OF MODEL PREDICTION, VALIDATION, AND IMPROVEMENT IS OFTEN A NEGLECTED STEP TO ACCURATE AND ADAPTIVE MODELING. TO ADDRESS THIS, THE LINK PREDICTION MODEL WILL BE RUN AGAIN WITH AN UPDATED DATASET CONTAINING THE VALIDATED PREDICTIONS, AND CHANGES IN MODEL PERFORMANCE WILL BE EVALUATED.

MAGGI KRAFT HAS BEEN AWARDED AN NSF EARTH SCIENCES POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF DR. SARAH GODSEY AT IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY. THE WESTERN UNITED STATES RELIES ON SNOW FOR WATER RESOURCES. IN THE SAME REGION, THE MAJORITY OF STREAMS FED BY SNOWMELT AND RAIN ARE NON-PERENNIAL WITH STREAMFLOW DISAPPEARING FOR AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE YEAR. WARMING GLOBAL TEMPERATURES ARE SHIFTING THE PRECIPITATION PHASE FROM SNOW TO RAIN, BUT THE IMPACTS OF SHIFTING SNOWFALL FRACTION IN NON-PERENNIAL STREAMS ARE NOT CLEAR. THIS RESEARCH WILL MERGE CONCEPTS OF SNOWMELT PROCESSES, VEGETATION DYNAMICS, AND SOIL PROPERTIES ACROSS THREE WATERSHEDS SPANNING THE RAIN-SNOW TRANSITION TO UNDERSTAND HOW PRECIPITATION PHASE AFFECTS STREAM WETTING AND DRYING. THESE INTERACTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN CONTROLLING STREAMFLOW RESPONSES ACROSS THE RAIN-SNOW TRANSITION WHERE VEGETATION, SNOW, AND SOILS ARE INTERRELATED AND SENSITIVE TO CHANGING TEMPERATURES. WHILE THESE CONCEPTS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN A PIECEWISE MANNER, THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN INTEGRATED TO ALLOW US TO ACCURATELY PREDICT NON-PERENNIAL STREAMFLOW RESPONSE TO CHANGING SNOW INPUTS. THIS RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE THE SCIENCE OF NON-PERENNIAL STREAM ECOSYSTEMS AND PROVIDE RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR MANAGING NATURAL RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP TWO EDUCATION AND OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES VIA DEVELOPING AND LEADING A WORKSHOP FOCUSED ON THE ANALYSIS OF STREAMFLOW PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA AND MENTORING AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND PRESENT AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROJECT. NON-PERENNIAL STREAMFLOW RESPONSE TO SHIFTS IN SNOW REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HYDROLOGIC BEHAVIOR. WATERSHEDS SPANNING THE RAIN-SNOW TRANSITION, WHERE PRECIPITATION SHIFTS PHASE BETWEEN SNOW AND RAIN, PROVIDE AN IDEAL LOCATION TO STUDY STREAMFLOW RESPONSE TO THE SHIFTING PRECIPITATION PHASE. ACROSS THE RAIN-SNOW TRANSITION FEEDBACKS BETWEEN VEGETATION, SNOW, AND SOIL ARE INTERRELATED THUS, EVALUATION OF COUPLED OBSERVATIONS IS NEEDED TO ACCURATELY PREDICT STREAMFLOW RESPONSE TO CHANGING SNOW WATER AVAILABILITY. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF INTEGRATED STUDIES LINKING DAILY SIGNALS OF SNOWMELT, TRANSPIRATION, AND SOIL MOISTURE IN NON-PERENNIAL WATERSHEDS. THE FOCUS OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO STUDY THE RESPONSE OF NON-PERENNIAL STREAM DRY-DOWN AND WET-UP TO INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SNOW, RAIN, VEGETATION, AND SOILS. THIS RESEARCH WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN THREE WATERSHEDS SPANNING THE RAIN-SNOW TRANSITION IN THE SEMI-ARID WESTERN U.S. USING MEASUREMENTS OF SNOW DEPTH, SAP FLUX, STREAM WATER PRESENCE-ABSENCE, SOIL MOISTURE, AND HIGH-RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE SATELLITE-DERIVED AND GROUND-BASED SNOWMELT, TRANSPIRATION, AND SOIL MOISTURE OBSERVATIONS WILL BE COMPARED TO THE ANNUAL AND DIEL STREAM WET-DRY CYCLE RESPONSE. HIGH-RESOLUTION SOIL DEPTH MAPS WILL BE CREATED TO EVALUATE HOW SOIL WATER CAPACITY, SNOW STORAGE, AND VEGETATION MODULATE RAIN OR SNOW WATER INPUTS AND NON-PERENNIAL STREAMFLOW.

JUSTIN HIGA HAS BEEN AWARDED AN NSF EARTH SCIENCES POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF DR. SCOTT ROWLAND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI?I AT M?NOA. DR. HIGA WILL EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS WEATHERING IN THE VALLEYS OF MT. KAH?L?WAI, MAUI, HAWAI?I, USA. LANDSLIDES FROM ROCKY, FRACTURED MOUNTAINS ARE DEADLY NATURAL DISASTERS THAT KILL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE SHAPE OF THE LAND SURFACE, THE TOPOGRAPHY, CAN ALTER STRESSES WITHIN MOUNTAINS TO CREATE SOME OF THESE FRACTURES AND MAY HELP CAUSE LANDSLIDES. THIS PROCESS, CALLED TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS WEATHERING, IS A BUDDING FRONTIER FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW FRACTURES FORM IN MOUNTAINS. THESE FRACTURES MAY WEAKEN ROCK AND GENERATE FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT FALL FROM STEEP SLOPES AND COLLECT IN STREAMS. THUS, THERE IS A NEED TO STUDY WHETHER TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS WEATHERING IS A MAJOR OR MINOR CONTRIBUTION TO THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF DANGEROUS LANDSLIDES ON A MOUNTAIN. COMPARING CALCULATIONS OF TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS TO ROCK STRENGTH, THE SIZE OF ROCK FRAGMENTS IN STREAMS, AND MAPPED LANDSLIDES MAY SHOW HOW TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS WEATHERING MIGHT AFFECT LANDSLIDE HAZARDS. THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PRESENTS A NEW WAY TO STUDY NATURAL DISASTERS BY LINKING TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS WITH FIELD OBSERVATIONS. SCIENTISTS CAN USE SUCH INFORMATION TO HELP PROTECT PEOPLE FROM LANDSLIDES. HIGA AIMS TO ENGAGE WITH LANDOWNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS OF MT. KAH?L?WAI TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS RESEARCH CAN BENEFIT LOCAL COMMUNITIES. HIGA WILL ALSO USE THIS PROJECT TO PARTNER WITH EARTH SCIENCE STUDENTS AND HELP TRAIN A GEOLOGIC WORKFORCE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF NATURAL HAZARD SCIENTISTS IN HAWAI?I. RECENT STUDIES ON TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS WEATHERING TARGET HOW SUBSURFACE STRESS FIELDS AFFECT THE EXTENT AND WIDTH OF BEDROCK FRACTURES. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR IF TOPOGRAPHIC STRESSES ARE A MAJOR CONTROL OF SURFACE PROCESSES AND NATURAL HAZARDS, SUCH AS LANDSLIDES. THIS PROJECT WILL ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS WEATHERING VERSUS CLIMATE IN THE GENERATION OF FRACTURED ROCK AND LANDSLIDES. PREVIOUS WORK SUGGESTS THAT STEEP, NARROW VALLEYS CONCENTRATE FRACTURE-INDUCING TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS PERTURBATIONS AT VALLEY BOTTOMS, WHEREAS WIDER VALLEYS MAY HAVE SUCH PERTURBATIONS OVER LARGER AREAS. THE STUDY HERE WILL BUILD OFF SUCH WORK AND FOCUS ON THE VALLEYS OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO, MT. KAH?L?WAI (ALSO KNOWN AS THE WEST MAUI MOUNTAINS), CHARACTERIZED BY NARROW AND WIDE VALLEYS WITH STEEP WALLS, A STRONG OROGRAPHIC RAINFALL GRADIENT, AND A LACK OF REGIONAL TECTONIC ACTIVITY. FIRST, A BOUNDARY ELEMENT COMPUTER MODEL WILL BE USED TO PREDICT THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF TOPOGRAPHIC STRESSES WITHIN VALLEYS OF VARIOUS MORPHOLOGIES (I.E., NARROW OR WIDE) AND CLIMATES (I.E., WINDWARD OR LEEWARD). NEXT, RESEARCHERS WILL COLLECT (1) REBOUND HAMMER STRENGTH MEASUREMENTS OF EXPOSED BEDROCK, (2) SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS OF STREAM CLASTS, AND (3) SATELLITE MAPPING OF LANDSLIDES OVER DECADAL TIMESCALES FROM THESE VALLEYS. IF TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS CONTROLS SURFACE PROCESSES, WIDE VALLEYS MAY HAVE WEAKER ROCKS, SMALLER CLASTS, AND MORE LANDSLIDES THAN STEEP, NARROW VALLEYS IN SIMILAR CLIMATES. THEN, COMPARING MODELS AND OBSERVATIONS FROM VALLEYS OF SIMILAR MORPHOLOGIES BUT DIFFERENT CLIMATES WILL CLASSIFY THE EFFECT OF PRECIPITATION ON WEATHERING. TOGETHER, THESE TESTS WILL EXAMINE HOW TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS AND CLIMATE WORK TO ERODE STEEP VALLEYS. DETERMINING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN TOPOGRAPHIC STRESS AND GEOMORPHIC TRANSPORT PROCESSES WILL HELP QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF STRESS-INDUCED FRACTURING ON VARIOUS LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION PROBLEMS, WHICH RESEARCHERS CAN IMPLEMENT WORLDWIDE.

THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE TWO PARTICULAR, YET, IN A CERTAIN SENSE, UNIVERSAL SYMMETRY GROUPS: THE GROTHENDIECK-TEICHMUELLER GROUP (GRT), AND THE KASHIWARA-VERGNE GROUP (KRV). BOTH ARE KNOWN TO HAVE DEEP CONNECTIONS TO MANY IMPORTANT AREAS OF MATHEMATICS AND MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS INCLUDING: QUANTUM THEORY, NUMBER THEORY, THE THEORY OF KNOTS AND TANGLES, AND THE THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GEOMETRIC INVARIANTS CALLED MOTIVES IN ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY. IN SPITE OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE, THE STRUCTURE OF BOTH GROUPS REMAINS QUITE MYSTERIOUS. THERE ARE LONG-STANDING CONJECTURES CONCERNING THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO ONE ANOTHER, AS WELL AS THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SYMMETRY GROUPS. IN PARTICULAR, A. ALEKSEEV AND C.

THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDE COORDINATING RESEARCH AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT EVENTS WITH UNR'S CHAPTER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR WOMEN IN MATHEMATICS. THIS PROJECT WILL FIND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THE VALIDITY OF THE ALEKSEEV-TOROSSIAN CONJECTURE BY BUILDING ON THE PI'S PREVIOUS EXHIBITING NON-TRIVIAL ACTIONS OF GRT ON SMOOTH COMPLEX ALGEBRAIC VARIETIES, AND A TOPOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF KRV USING WHEELED PROPS AND KNOTTED SURFACES IN 4-DIMENSIONAL SPACE.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS OF NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (NMR) SPECTROMETERS NEED PERIODIC REFILLS OF LIQUID HELIUM TO MAINTAIN PERSISTENT MAGNETIC FIELDS. SEVERE SHORTAGES OF HELIUM HAVE FORCED THE MOTHBALLING OF SOME INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ADVERSELY IMPACTS MANY NSF-FUNDED AND OTHER PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE REGION. RESPONSIBLE RESOURCE UTILIZATION THAT MINIMIZES WASTE BY RECYCLING GASEOUS HELIUM EXHAUST PROTECTS PRESENT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND PRESERVES THIS NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCE, ENABLING FUTURE GENERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL HEALTH, PROSPERITY, AND WELFARE. FURTHERMORE, INFORMATION ABOUT THE REQUESTED EQUIPMENT IS BEING INTEGRATED INTO A COMPREHENSIVE OUTREACH EFFORT TO ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, RECRUIT AND RETAIN FACULTY, STAFF AND STUDENTS, AND ENHANCE THE CLASSROOM AND RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS. THE NINE INSTRUMENTS BEING SERVED BY THE HELIUM RECOVERY EQUIPMENT ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS FOUR SEPARATE BUILDINGS. SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THE FEASIBILITY OF A HUB-AND-SPOKE MODEL FOR OTHER INSTITUTIONS NEEDING TO RECOVER HELIUM FROM DISPERSED DEVICES. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES 1) FABRICATION OF MANIFOLDS USING OFF-THE-SHELF PARTS TO COLLECT HELIUM EXHAUST WITHOUT DISTURBING INSTRUMENT OPERATION; 2) SHORT-TERM STORAGE OF HELIUM IN 8500-LITER BAGS; 3) COMPRESSION OF COLLECTED GAS INTO HIGH-PRESSURE CYLINDERS FOR TRANSPORT TO A CENTRALIZED FACILITY ON CAMPUS; 4) PURIFICATION AND LIQUEFACTION OF THE GAS; AND 5) REUSE OF THE RESULTING LIQUID HELIUM IN SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS. IN ONE YEAR OF OPERATION, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ~2,400 LITERS OF LIQUID HELIUM WILL BE RECYCLED BY THIS SYSTEM.

NO IS A SMALL MOLECULE IMPORTANT FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASES. THE PRODUCTION AND CONCENTRATION OF NO IS TIGHTLY REGULATED AS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGNALING MOLECULE IN HEALTHY BIOLOGY; DEVIATIONS IN NO CONCENTRATION CAN ALSO POTENTIALLY LEAD TO BIOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION; HENCE METHODS TO ACCURATELY DETECT NO LEVELS, PARTICULARLY IN LIVING SYSTEMS ARE IN HIGH DEMAND. BECAUSE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF NO IN CELLS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM CELL TO CELL, MEANINGFUL STUDIES NEED TO BE PERFORMED AT THE SINGLE-CELL LEVEL. HOWEVER, DETECTING AND QUANTIFYING NO IN SINGLE CELLS IS VERY CHALLENGING, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF ITS INSTABILITY AND LOW ABUNDANCE (E.G., A CELL DIAMETER IS ~1/10 OF THAT OF HUMAN HAIR). DR. YANG AND HIS GROUP WILL DESIGN A MICROSCALE DEVICE THAT CAN BE COUPLED TO A SENSITIVE ANALYTICAL TOOL, MASS SPECTROMETRY (MS). THIS DEVICE CAN DIRECTLY EXTRACT NO FROM SINGLE CELLS, AND THEN USE ONLINE CHEMICAL REACTIONS TO CONVERT IT INTO A STABLE MOLECULE FOR SENSITIVE DETECTION AND ACCURATE QUANTIFICATION USING MS. THIS NEW TECHNIQUE CAN POTENTIALLY OFFER A NEW ANALYTICAL TOOL FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF OXIDANTS SUCH AS NO AT THE SINGLE LEVEL.

THE PRODUCTS (E.G., LECTURE MATERIALS, LESSONS, AND SURVEY RESULTS) FROM THE OUTREACH PROGRAM WILL BE ACCESSIBLE BY OTHER HIGH SCHOOLS AND GENERAL PUBLIC. IN ADDITION, CONDUCTING THE RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. NO IS A SMALL BIOACTIVE MOLECULE PLAYING IMPORTANT ROLES IN NUMEROUS CELL FUNCTIONS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO NEURONAL SIGNALING, IMMUNE RESPONSE, AND HUMAN DISEASE. THE FUNCTIONS OF NO ARE RELATED TO ITS ABUNDANCE IN CELLS. DUE TO CELL HETEROGENEITY, WHICH HAS BEEN REPORTED IN NEARLY ALL BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, THE ABUNDANCE OF NO SIGNIFICANTLY VARIES FROM CELL TO CELL. QUANTIFICATION OF NO IN INDIVIDUAL CELLS COULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNCTIONS AND MECHANISMS OF NO IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES ARE VERY CHALLENGING, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EXTREMELY SMALL SIZE OF SINGLE CELLS AND THE REACTIVE, DIFFUSIVE NATURE OF NO. THIS PROPOSAL COMBINES CHEMICAL REACTIONS WITH SINGLE CELL MASS SPECTROMETRY (SCMS) TO DETECT AND QUANTIFY NO IN SINGLE CELLS. CELL LINES WILL BE USED AS MODEL SYSTEMS TO PRODUCE ENDOGENOUS AND EXOGENOUS NO. AN ESTABLISHED SINGLE-PROBE SCMS EXPERIMENTAL SETUP WILL BE COMBINED WITH OFF-LINE CHEMICAL REACTIONS FOR NO MEASUREMENT. THE KEY DIAGNOSTIC REACTION INVOLVES THE TWO-ELECTRON OXIDATION OF AMLODIPINE (AML) TO DEHYDROAMLODIPINE (DAM ). SINCE THIS REACTION INVOLVES THE SIMPLE REMOVAL OF THE ELEMENTS OF H-H FROM AML, THE OBSERVATION OF DAM IS AN INDIRECT MEASURE OF NO, AND IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO CONTROL FOR OTHER TWO-ELECTRON OXIDATION REACTIONS THAT COULD, IN PRINCIPLE, PRODUCE DAM FROM AML. PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY, AS PART OF THESE STUDIES, A NEW DEVICE, THE ELONGATED SINGLE-PROBE (ESINGLE-PROBE), IS BEING DEVELOPED AND WILL BE USED FOR REAL-TIME REACTIVE (RRSCMS) ANALYSIS FOR NO IN SINGLE CELLS.

THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL ENHANCE RESEARCH AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT A HISTORICALLY BLACK UNIVERSITY AND OFFER BROADER PARTICIPATION IN STEM FOR MINORITY STUDENTS. STUDENTS WILL BE MENTORED, WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THE RESEARCH USED AS COURSE-BASED UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE IN PLANT ANATOMY, PLANT PHYSIOLOGY, AND ECOLOGY CLASSES. THE RESULTS FROM THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE PRESENTED AT CONFERENCES AND PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS. LOCAL FARMERS MIGHT ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE OUTCOMES OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT. ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, P. CLANDESTINUM (KIKUYU GRASS) IS A FEDERALLY LISTED NOXIOUS WEED THAT IS COMPETITIVE AGAINST LEGUMES. IT IS A PERENNIAL GRASS WHOSE SEEDS CAN LIE DORMANT FOR A LONG TIME. IT CAN ALSO DEVELOP FROM RHIZOMES, EASILY COLONIZE THE SOIL SURFACE, AND GROW FAST. E. CRUS-GALLI (BARNYARD GRASS) IS AN ANNUAL, FAST-GROWING WEED COMPETING AGAINST RICE. L. MULTIFLORUM (ITALIAN RYEGRASS) IS AN ANNUAL OR BIENNIAL WEED THAT COMPETES WITH CEREAL CROPS. THE AUTHORS OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT HAVE OBSERVED THAT NICANDRA PHYSALODES FROM THE SOLANACEAE, A PLANT THAT CONTAINS ALKALOIDS, CAN BE USED TO MANAGE MONOCOTYLEDONOUS GRASSES. THE HYPOTHESIS FOR THE PROPOSED STUDY IS THAT ALKALOIDS FOUND IN NICANDRA PHYSALODES WILL INHIBIT THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF P. CLANDESTINUM (KIKUYU GRASS), E. CRUS-GALLI (BARNYARD GRASS), AND L. MULTIFLORUM (ITALIAN RYEGRASS). THE INVESTIGATORS, INCLUDING THE FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS, WILL EXAMINE THE MORPHOLOGICAL, OBSERVABLE, DEVELOPMENT, AND GROWTH EFFECTS OF N. PHYSALODES ON THE THREE NOXIOUS WEEDS UNDER DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND THE SOIL PH. ALSO, CELL DIVISION IS EXPECTED TO BE AFFECTED WHEN THE THREE WEEDS DISPLAY GROWTH INHIBITION. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE ANY CHROMOSOME ABERRATIONS EXPRESSED WHEN THE WEEDS ARE GROWING IN THE PRESENCE OF N. PHYSALODES. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL ALSO INCLUDE THE INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPOUNDS THAT WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM THE N. PHYSALODES, WHICH PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE INHIBITION OF THE GROWTH OF THESE THREE WEEDS.

ONE TYPE OF ELECTROLYTES IS ELECTROLYTE SOLUTIONS CONSISTING OF SALTS DISSOLVED IN SOLVENTS, EITHER WATER (AQUEOUS) OR ORGANIC MOLECULES (NONAQUEOUS). THESE ELECTROLYTES ARE TYPICALLY IN A LIQUID STATE DURING THE BATTERY OPERATION. DESPITE THE ADVANTAGES OF SAFETY, NON-TOXICITY, AND LOW COST, AQUEOUS ELECTROLYTES GENERALLY HAVE A NARROW ELECTROCHEMICAL STABILITY WINDOW (I.E., ~1.23 V), BEYOND WHICH UNDESIRED WATER ELECTROLYSIS OCCURS, TRIGGERING A SERIES OF PROBLEMS FOR THE BATTERY ELECTROLYTES AND ELECTRODES. FOR NONAQUEOUS ELECTROLYTES WITH ORGANIC SOLVENTS, ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES IS THEIR HIGH FLAMMABILITY, WHICH MIGHT CAUSE SAFETY CONCERNS DURING BATTERY USE AND FAILURE. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE RESEARCH OF NOVEL NONAQUEOUS ELECTROLYTES FOR NEXT-GENERATION ZINC (ZN)-ION BATTERIES.

A LARGE DETECTOR SIZE IS ESSENTIAL FOR OBTAINING HIGH ACCURACY AND EFFICIENCY FOR DETECTING NUCLEAR MATERIALS OF INTEREST INCLUDING HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM-239 ESPECIALLY IN A MOVING CARGO. LARGE AREA AND LOW-COST RADIATION DETECTORS WILL ALSO ENHANCE OPERATION EFFICIENCY AND IMPROVE QUALITY CONTROL OF MANY INDUSTRIAL MINING AND METALLURGICAL PROCESSES. IN ADDITION, PIXELATED RADIATION DETECTOR ARRAYS ARE REQUIRED FOR NUCLEAR MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS AND FOR THE STUDY OF PARTICLE PHYSICS IN OUTER SPACE. CURRENT DETECTOR ARRAYS WITH INORGANIC SINGLE CRYSTALS HAVE SUFFERED FROM A LIMITED SPATIAL RESOLUTION DUE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF MACHINING THESE SINGLE CRYSTALS INTO SMALL SIZE PIXELS AND ASSEMBLING THEM INTO DENSE DETECTOR ARRAYS. TO SOLVE THESE CHALLENGES, THE TEAM AIMS TO DEVELOP NEW SEMICONDUCTOR-POLYMER COMPOSITES AS A REPLACEMENT OF THE CONVENTIONAL SINGLE CRYSTALS FOR RADIATION DETECTORS AND DETECTOR ARRAYS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THERE WILL BE TREMENDOUS PROCESSING AND MANUFACTURING ADVANTAGES OF THE COMPOSITES COMPARED WITH THEIR INORGANIC SINGLE CRYSTAL COUNTERPARTS, FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPOSITES CAN BE POTENTIALLY PROCESSED LIKE COMMODITY PLASTICS BY SOLUTION CASTING, HOT PRESSING, MELT EXTRUSION AND INJECTION MOLDING TO ACHIEVE RADIATION DETECTORS WITH LARGE SIZES AND VARIOUS SHAPES, OR BY 3D PRINTING TO ACHIEVE DETECTOR ARRAYS WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY. TECHNICAL SUMMARY: THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE A GROUP OF ORGANOMETAL HALIDE PEROVSKITE (PEROVSKITE) SEMICONDUCTORS AND THEIR POLYMER MATRIX COMPOSITES. THE STATE-OF-THE-ART PEROVSKITE SEMICONDUCTORS EXHIBIT A LONG CHARGE CARRIER LIFETIME AND HIGH CARRIER MOBILITY, CONTAIN HIGH ATOMIC NUMBER ELEMENTS (CESIUM, LEAD, AND IODINE), AND HAVE A HIGH RADIATION HARDNESS, MAKING THEM IDEAL CANDIDATES FOR RADIATION DETECTOR APPLICATION. MOREOVER, THEY CAN BE READILY DISSOLVED IN MANY ORGANIC SOLVENTS, FACILITATING THE FORMULATION OF PEROVSKITE-POLYMER COMPOSITES FOR THIS PROPOSED PROJECT. THE WORK WILL LEAD TO FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE, PROCESSING, AND PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS OF HALIDE PEROVSKITE-POLYMER COMPOSITES INCLUDING, 1) HOW TO ENGINEER THE CHEMICAL INTERFACES BETWEEN THE PEROVSKITE AND POLYMER PHASES TO IMPROVE PEROVSKITE CRYSTAL DISPERSITY AND SUPPRESS IONIC CHARGE MIGRATION; AND 2) HOW TO ENGINEER THE ELECTRONIC INTERFACES IN THE COMPOSITE TO ENHANCE AND BALANCE BOTH ELECTRON AND HOLE COLLECTION UPON IRRADIATION OF HIGH ENERGY PHOTONS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE WORK WILL ESTABLISH A NEW ERA OF ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING BY INVESTIGATING FOR THE FIRST TIME THE 3D PRINTING OF PEROVSKITE-POLYMER COMPOSITES FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION PIXELATED RADIATION DETECTORS. THE KNOWLEDGE OF UNDERSTANDING AND ENGINEERING CHARGE TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN THE COMPOSITES CAN PROVIDE IMPORTANCE GUIDANCE FOR FUTURE EXPLORATION OF OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR-POLYMER COMPOSITES FOR NEW GENERATION LARGE SCALE, LOW-COST OPTOELECTRONIC MANUFACTURING.

DUE TO THE NATURE OF THEIR PACKAGING AND RELEASE, THESE VESICLES CAN CONTAIN MOLECULES THAT ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIR CELLS OF ORIGIN. THIS MEANS THAT EXOSOMES CAN CARRY BIOMARKERS FOR VARIOUS DISEASE STATES, INCLUDING CANCER AND ALZHEIMER?S DISEASE. HOWEVER, CURRENT METHODS FOR ISOLATING AND PURIFYING EXOSOMES ARE COSTLY AND OFTEN INEFFECTIVE.

THE GOAL OF THIS HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES - EXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH (HBCU-EIR) PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL FOR ENGINEERING THERMO-SENSITIVE LIPOSOMES FOR APPLICATIONS IN BIOSENSING AND DOWNSTREAM DIAGNOSTIC APPLICATIONS. THIS WILL ADDRESS A CRITICAL CHALLENGE IN THE FIELD, WHICH IS TO EXERT SELECTIVE CONTROL OVER SPECIFIC EXOSOME POPULATIONS WITHIN A MIXED SAMPLE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE ABILITY TO DIRECT THE RELEASE OF A SUBSET OF EXOSOMES FROM A CAPTURE SUBSTRATE AND TO DISCHARGE THEIR INTRA-VESICULAR CARGO IN A RELIABLE AND HIGHLY CONTROLLED MANNER COULD REPLACE BURDENSOME PURIFICATION AND ISOLATION PROTOCOLS AND BROADEN THE TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLBOX FOR INTEGRATED BIOSENSORS.

IN 1968, STRASSEN DISCOVERED THAT THE WIDELY USED ALGORITHM FOR MATRIX MULTIPLICATION WHICH WAS ASSUMED TO BE THE BEST POSSIBLE, IS IN FACT NOT OPTIMAL. SINCE THEN, THERE HAS BEEN INTENSE RESEARCH IN BOTH DETERMINING JUST HOW EFFICIENTLY MATRICES MAY BE MULTIPLIED AND DETERMINING THE LIMITS OF HOW MUCH STRASSEN'S ALGORITHM CAN BE IMPROVED. THE PI PROPOSES TO USE MODERN MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES TO TACKLE THOSE PROBLEMS. THIS PROJECT WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL BROADER IMPACT THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SOFTWARE FOR THE OPEN-SOURCE COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEM MACAULAY2, AND THROUGH THE PI?S INTEREST IN BROADENING PARTICIPATION IN MATHEMATICAL RESEARCH. THE PROPOSAL INVOLVES SEVERAL MAIN THEMES: WEYMAN-KEMPF GEOMETRIC TECHNIQUES, SYZYGIES AND MINIMAL FREE RESOLUTIONS, SECANT VARIETIES AND THE STUDY OF TENSOR RANKS. THE FIRST GOAL IS TO FIND NEW EXAMPLES AND ANALYZE EXISTING EXAMPLES TO EXTEND WEYMAN-KEMPF GEOMETRIC TECHNIQUES TO STUDY NON-NORMAL VARIETIES. THE SECOND GOAL IS THE STUDY OF NILPOTENT ORBIT CLOSURES AND DETERMINANTAL THICKENINGS. THE PI WILL USE TECHNICAL TOOLS SUCH AS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE AND LIE SUPERALGEBRA REPRESENTATIONS TO COMPUTE NUMERICAL AND HOMOLOGICAL INVARIANTS OF RELATED VARIETIES. THE THIRD TOPIC IS THE COMPUTATION OF DIFFERENT TENSOR RANKS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO MATRIX MULTIPLICATION COMPLEXITY. USING TOOLS FROM MODERN ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY SUCH AS DEFORMATION THEORY, THE PI WILL TACKLE A NUMBER OF LONGSTANDING OPEN CONJECTURES. THIS PROJECT IS JOINTLY FUNDED BY THE ALGEBRA AND NUMBER THEORY PROGRAM IN THE DIVISION OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES, AND BY THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR).

IN PHYSICS, AUTOMORPHIC FORMS MODEL SYMMETRY CONDITIONS OF SUPERSYMMETRIC STRING THEORY AND ARE USED TO FIND COEFFICIENTS OF THE SCATTERING AMPLITUDE FOR GRAVITONS (HYPOTHETICAL PARTICLES OF GRAVITY). FINDING HIGHER ORDER COEFFICIENTS OF THE GRAVITON SCATTERING AMPLITUDE MAY PROVIDE A QUANTUM CORRECTION TO THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN RELATIVITY AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ANSWER A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS CENTERED AROUND THE THEORY OF L-FUNCTIONS AND SCATTERING AMPLITUDES FOR CERTAIN STRING INTERACTIONS USING THE STUDY OF AUTOMORPHIC FORMS.

THIS PROJECT ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE SOME OF THE CENTRAL AND MOST RECENT QUESTIONS ABOUT DERIVED CATEGORIES USING TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS AND MANY OTHERS OVER THE LAST DECADE. THIS AWARD WILL ALSO SUPPORT UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON THREE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT DERIVED CATEGORIES. TOGETHER, THESE QUESTIONS INCORPORATE NUMEROUS AREAS OF MATHEMATICS INCLUDING BIRATIONAL GEOMETRY, ENUMERATIVE GEOMETRY, AND NON-COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA. SPECIFICALLY, OUR FIRST QUESTION STUDIES CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DERIVED CATEGORIES AND BIRATIONAL GEOMETRY (AND THE POSSIBLY CONCEALED CONNECTION BETWEEN FLIPS/FLOPS AND DERIVED PARTIAL COMPACTIFICATIONS). WE ASK WHETHER K-EQUIVALENT VARIETIES HAVE EQUIVALENT DERIVED CATEGORIES, A CENTRAL CONJECTURE ABOUT DERIVED CATEGORIES DUE TO BONDAL-ORLOV AND KAWAMATA. OUR SECOND QUESTION ASKS HOW DECOMPOSITIONS OF QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY ARE RELATED TO SEMI-ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITIONS OF DERIVED CATEGORIES.

PAST RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE OCEAN SPRAY EFFECTS ON HURRICANE DYNAMICS DEPEND STRONGLY ON THE SIZE OF SPRAY DROPLETS. THEREFORE, THE PI WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK AND ITS NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION TO ACCURATELY MODEL THE POLYDISPERSE OCEAN SPRAY EFFECT ON THE VERTICAL FLUXES OF MOMENTUM AND HEAT IN A HURRICANE BOUNDARY LAYER. THIS WILL AID IN IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF HURRICANE FORECASTS, WHICH IN TURN WILL HELP MINIMIZE PROPERTY DAMAGE AND LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE. THE RESEARCH PROJECT WILL ALSO ALLOW NORTH CAROLINA A&T STATE UNIVERSITY, A STATE-SUPPORTED HBCU, TO SUSTAIN AND EXPAND RECENTLY ESTABLISHED NEW RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL CAPACITY IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING WITH APPLICATIONS TO ATMOSPHERIC MULTIPHASE TURBULENT FLOWS.

ANMBRS COMBINE MEMBRANE FILTRATION (MICROFILTRATION OR ULTRAFILTRATION) WITH ANAEROBIC DIGESTION IN SPECIALLY DESIGNED BIOREACTORS. ANAEROBIC DYNAMIC MEMBRANE BIOREACTORS (ANDMBRS) HAVE EMERGED AS PROMISING ALTERNATIVES TO ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS OF CURRENT ANMBRS INCLUDING LOW FLUX, HIGH CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS, AND HIGH PROPENSITY FOR MEMBRANE FOULING. IN ANDMBRS, IN-SITU FORMED BIOFILMS ON STAINLESS-STEEL MESHES (OR WOVEN/NONWOVEN FABRICS) WITH PORE SIZES RANGING FROM 5-200 MICRONS PROVIDE THE FILTRATION MEDIA THEREBY CIRCUMVENTING THE NEED TO USE COMMERCIAL MICROFILTRATION OR ULTRAFILTRATION MEMBRANES. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS ERI PROJECT IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANDMBRS TO REMOVE PATHOGENIC BACTERIA, GENES, AND OTHER BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPREAD OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE WITH THE GOAL OF PRODUCING WATER EFFLUENTS THAT ARE SAFE FOR AGRICULTURAL REUSE. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT SOCIETY BY ADVANCING FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ON THE USE OF ANDMBRS TO ENABLE THE SUSTAINABLE AND SAFE REUSE OF RURAL WASTEWATER FOR CROP IRRIGATION.

RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE BIOFILMS THAT FORM ON MEMBRANE SURFACES IN ANMBRS CAN ENHANCE EFFLUENT WATER QUALITY AND AID IN THE REMOVAL OF PATHOGENIC BACTERIA AND EMERGING BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL UNCLEAR IF THE BIOFILMS OF ANDMBRS CAN MAINTAIN SIMILAR BENEFITS FOR THE REMOVAL OF PATHOGENIC BACTERIA, GENES OR OTHER MARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE. THIS ERI PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAP. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH ARE TO 1) QUANTIFY THE CONCENTRATION AND ABUNDANCE OF ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT BACTERIA (ARBS), ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE GENES (ARGS), AND OTHER RELEVANT GENE TRANSFER ELEMENTS IN ANMBR SYSTEM EFFLUENTS; 2) ESTABLISH A BASELINE FOR ASSESSING THE ABUNDANCES OF BOTH INTRACELLULAR AND EXTRACELLULAR ARGS IN ANMBR SYSTEM EFFLUENTS DURING THE TREATMENT OF REAL AND REPRESENTATIVE RURAL WASTEWATERS; AND 3) EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANDMBRS TO REMOVE ARBS AND ARGS DURING THE TREATMENT OF RURAL WASTEWATERS.

WISKUR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA IS DEVELOPING POLYMERS THAT CAN BE USED IN ORGANIC REACTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY. CHEMISTS EMPLOY POLYMERS IN ORGANIC REACTIONS TO AID IN THE REMOVAL OF PRODUCTS/CATALYSTS/ETC. AT REACTION COMPLETION TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PURIFICATION THAT IS NEEDED, SINCE PURIFICATION CAN BE COSTLY AND WASTEFUL. THE PROBLEM IS THAT REACTIONS EMPLOYING THESE POLYMERS TEND TO SUFFER FROM DIMINISHED YIELD OR SELECTIVITY VERSUS WHEN THEY WERE JUST RUN IN SOLUTION. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE MICROENVIRONMENT OF THE POLYMER AFFECTS THESE REACTIONS AND TUNE THAT MICROENVIRONMENT SUCH THAT YIELD AND SELECTIVITY ARE RETAINED WHEN EMPLOYING THESE POLYMERS. THIS PROJECT INCORPORATES ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, POLYMER CHEMISTRY, AND SUPRAMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, AND WILL PROVIDE A DIVERSE TRAINING GROUND FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ALIKE. BROADER IMPACTS ALSO INCLUDE THE MENTORING OF WOMEN SCIENTISTS TO AID IN RETAINING WOMEN IN SCIENCE. SINCE DEVELOPING POLYMER-BASED CHEMISTRY IS A VALUABLE GOAL TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY, THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF METHODOLOGY TO POLYMERS IS AN IMPORTANT ENDEAVOR. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY CHEMISTRY TRANSFERRED ONTO SOLUBLE POLYMERS TEND TO SUFFER LOSS IN SELECTIVITY AND/OR YIELD. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE POLARITY OF THE POLYMER?S MICROENVIRONMENT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE BULK SOLVENT, WHICH DOES NOT PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENT NEEDED FOR THE BEST RESULTS. THIS PROPOSAL LOOKS AT HOW THE MICROENVIRONMENT POLARITY OF THE POLYMER CAN AFFECT REACTION OUTCOMES SUCH AS YIELD AND SELECTIVITY. STUDIES PROPOSED INCLUDE INCORPORATING A SOLVATOCHROMOPHORE INTO FUNCTIONALIZED POLYMERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS AFFECT THE MICROENVIRONMENT POLARITY. ADDITIONALLY, AN ISOTHIOUREA CATALYST WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THESE SAME FUNCTIONALIZED POLYMERS AND USED TO CATALYZE A MODEL REACTION TO UNDERSTAND THE MICROENVIRONMENT EFFECT ON RATE AND SELECTIVITY.

MIXTURES SUCH AS BLOOD AND URINE CONTAIN THOUSANDS OF MOLECULES THAT REFLECT THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE HUMAN BODY. HIDDEN WITHIN THESE COMPLICATED FLUIDS CAN BE MOLECULAR CLUES ABOUT DISEASES OR DISORDERS, THAT IF DETECTED EARLY CAN AID IN THEIR TREATMENT. DR. DUNN AND HIS GROUP ARE DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES TO RAPIDLY DETECT THESE MOLECULES BY SEPARATING MIXTURES THROUGH SMALL CAPILLARIES THAT ARE AS THIN AS A HUMAN HAIR. THE THIN WALL OF THE CAPILLARY ENABLES UNIQUE CONTROL OVER FUNDAMENTAL SEPARATION PARAMETERS WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED TO ENHANCE DETECTION. THE RESEARCH PLAN COMBINES FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES WITH APPLIED MEASUREMENTS AND ELEMENTS OF ENGINEERING, THUS EXPOSING STUDENTS TO A HIGHLY INTERDISCIPLINARY AND COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT.

THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL TRAIN UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS IN A HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY ENVIRONMENT, LEADING TO ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. PLANAR CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS (PCE) USES A SHORT LENGTH CAPILLARY TO RAPIDLY SEPARATE AND DETECT SPECIES IN COMPLEX MIXTURES. THE PCE USES A 10 CM TOTAL LENGTH CAPILLARY (50 UM I.D. X 80 UM O.D.) WITH AN ULTRA-THIN CAPILLARY WALL (15 UM) THAT EFFICIENTLY DISSIPATES HEAT AND MITIGATES THE EFFECTS OF JOULE HEATING. THE UTIIZATION OF AN ULTRA-THIN WALL PROVIDES PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES AND PROBING FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES.

THIS ALLOWS FACILE CONTROL OF THE EOF AND LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PEAK EFFICIENCY. THE MECHANISM FOR THE LATTER WILL BE FULLY EXPLORED THROUGH EXPERIMENT AND SIMULATION AND OPTIMIZED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE.

COMBINATORICS IS A SUBFIELD OF MATHEMATICS CONCERNED WITH THE STUDY OF DISCRETE STRUCTURES. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE GRAPHS AND MATROIDS, WHICH ARE TWO CLASSICAL TOPICS IN COMBINATORICS. A GRAPH IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS A NETWORK, A CONCEPT WHICH IS NOW WIDELY KNOWN DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF SOCIAL NETWORKS. ON THE OTHER HAND, A MATROID IS A STRUCTURE WHICH ABSTRACTS THE NOTION OF LINEAR INDEPENDENCE IN MATHEMATICS, E.G. WHETHER OR NOT THREE GIVEN POINTS IN A PLANE LIE ON A COMMON LINE. COMBINATORICS ADMITS MANY IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS WITH ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY, WHICH IS THE STUDY OF SOLUTIONS TO POLYNOMIAL EQUATIONS, AND TROPICAL GEOMETRY WHICH IS A COMBINATORIAL VERSION OF ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY. ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF TROPICAL GEOMETRY IS THAT SOME DIFFICULT QUESTIONS IN ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY CAN BE REDUCED TO PROBLEMS IN COMBINATORICS. THERE IS A COMPLEMENTARY STRENGTH OF THIS THEORY: IT PROVIDES A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON CLASSICAL COMBINATORIAL OBJECTS SUCH AS GRAPHS AND MATROIDS, WHICH CAN BE VIEWED AS TROPICAL CURVES AND TROPICAL LINEAR SPACES, RESPECTIVELY, THUS OPENING THESE FIELDS UP TO NEW TECHNIQUES AND QUESTIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE GRAPHS AND MATROIDS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF TROPICAL GEOMETRY. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO PROVIDE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS, AS WELL AS OUTREACH ACTIVITIES TO RURAL HIGH SCHOOLS IN VERMONT. A GRAPH CAN BE VIEWED AS THE TROPICALIZATION OF A CURVE OVER A NON-ARCHIMEDEAN FIELD. DIVISOR THEORY FOR CURVES THEN TRANSLATES TO THE CLASSICAL STUDY OF CHIP-FIRING. THIS HAS ALLOWED FOR DEEP INSIGHTS INTO CHIP-FIRING SUCH AS THE RIEMANN-ROCH THEOREM FOR GRAPHS. THE PI AIMS TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND DIVISOR THEORY FOR GRAPHS, CONNECTIONS TO GRAPH ORIENTATIONS, COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY, AND THE TUTTE POLYNOMIAL. TROPICAL GEOMETRY IS CONCERNED WITH THE STUDY OF BALANCED POLYHEDRAL COMPLEXES EVEN WHEN THEY DO NOT ARISE AS THE TROPICALIZATIONS OF VARIETIES. THIS PERSPECTIVE HAS BEEN VERY FRUITFUL IN RECENT YEARS AS ALL MATROIDS, NOT ONLY THE REALIZABLE ONES, FIT INTO THIS FRAMEWORK.

GROUPS ARE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTS IN MATHEMATICS AND UBIQUITOUS IN REAL LIFE; FOR EXAMPLE, THE NUMBERS ON A 12-HOUR CLOCK FORM A GROUP OF 12 ELEMENTS. THE ADDRESSED PROBLEMS ARE OF COMBINATORIAL NATURE; FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE TAKE ANY SUBSET OF A GROUP, THEN AS LONG AS THE SUBSET IS ''LARGE'' IN SOME SENSE (WITHOUT ANY ASSUMPTION ON ITS STRUCTURE), WE PREDICT THAT SOME PATTERN WILL EMERGE. GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BE TRAINED AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE PI WILL ALSO BE INVOLVED IN K-12 OUTREACH. THE GROUPS STUDIED IN THIS PROJECT ARE: (1) THE INTEGERS AND THEIR POLYNOMIAL RING ANALOGS, FOR WHICH TECHNIQUES FROM NUMBER THEORY APPLY, (2) FINITE GROUPS, INCLUDING VECTOR SPACES OVER FINITE FIELDS, FOR WHICH TECHNIQUES FROM ALGEBRA APPLY, AND (3) MORE GENERAL AMENABLE GROUPS, FOR WHICH TECHNIQUES FROM FOURIER ANALYSIS AND ERGODIC THEORY APPLY.

THE ISOTOPE COMPOSITIONS OF DEEP-EARTH MINERALS ARE CONTROLLED BY A PROCESS NAMED ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION, IN WHICH DIFFERENT ISOTOPES REDISTRIBUTE BETWEEN DIFFERENT MINERALS UNDER VARIOUS PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES. THERE ARE THREE CONVENTIONAL WAYS TO CONSTRAIN EQUILIBRIUM ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION IN DEEP-EARTH MINERALS, NAMELY THEORETICAL CALCULATION, MASS SPECTROSCOPY, AND NUCLEAR RESONANCE SCATTERING. HOWEVER, EACH METHOD HAS ITS OWN CHALLENGES. THEORETICAL CALCULATION IS LIMITED BY PHYSICAL APPROXIMATIONS USED IN THE MODEL AND HAS TO BE BENCHMARKED BY EXPERIMENTS; MASS SPECTROSCOPY HAS DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE ATTAINMENT OF EQUILIBRIUM AND IS TIME-CONSUMING; AND NUCLEAR RESONANCE SCATTERING CAN ONLY BE APPLIED TO THE FEW M?SSBAUER-ACTIVE ELEMENTS. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES A NOVEL MULTIDISCIPLINARY STUDY ON THE ISOTOPE FRACTIONATIONS OF DEEP-EARTH MINERALS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO BE CONSTRAINED BY CONVENTIONAL EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES, THROUGH COLLABORATIVE AND SYNERGETIC EFFORTS BY COMBINING STATE-OF-THE-ART X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY WITH THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS. THE RESEARCHER'S APPROACH IS EXPERIMENTALLY BENCHMARKED, TIME-EFFICIENT, DIRECTLY REFLECTS THE EQUILIBRIUM ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION, AND CAN BE APPLIED TO NEARLY ALL ELEMENTS. THEY AIM TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSED STUDY: 1) HOW DO THE M?SSBAUER-INACTIVE ELEMENTS IN DEEP-EARTH MINERALS REDISTRIBUTE WITH PRESSURE, TEMPERATURE, AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURE? 2) HOW TO CONSTRAIN THE FRACTIONATION OF M?SSBAUER-INACTIVE ELEMENTS IN DEEP EARTH SOLID SOLUTIONS EFFICIENTLY? AND 3) HOW DOES VIBRATIONAL ANHARMONICITY AFFECT THE ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION IN MANTLE SILICATES? THE PROJECT WILL SUPPORT THREE EARLY TO MID-CAREER RESEARCHERS TO CONTINUE THEIR RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MAONA (ZHANG AND B. CHEN) AND PURDUE UNIVERSITY (M. CHEN). THROUGH THIS PROJECT, THE TEAM WILL DEVELOP BOTH EXPERIMENTAL INSTRUMENTS AT A NATIONAL USER FACILITY AND OPEN-SOURCE CODES FOR COMPUTATION, AND THE RESEARCH SUITE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL RESEARCHERS IN EARTH SCIENCES AND BEYOND.

THIS PROJECT IS ALSO COMMITTED TO ESTABLISHING THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT PATHWAYS FOR THE INVOLVED EARLY-CAREER RESEARCHERS, PUSHING FOR THE GENDER AND RACIAL EQUALITY IN GEOSCIENCE, AND BROADENING THE PARTICIPATION IN STEM OF TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. THE FRACTIONATION OF THE ISOTOPES OF CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF MANTLE MINERALS AT HIGH P-T CONDITIONS ARE CONSIDERED THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE EARTH, OFFERING CRUCIAL CLUES FOR THE MANTLE?S COMPOSITION AND CHEMICAL EVOLUTION. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION OF M?SSBAUER-INACTIVE ELEMENTS BETWEEN MINERALS WERE EITHER MEASURED USING MASS SPECTROSCOPY IN WHICH THE ATTAINMENT OF EQUILIBRIUM REQUIRES ADDITIONAL CAUTION, OR ESTIMATED FROM THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS WITHOUT CORROBORATION FROM EXPERIMENTS. THE RESEARCHERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE REDUCED PARTITION FUNCTION RATIO (?-FACTOR) OF TETRACOORDINATED SI CAN BE CONSTRAINED BY THEORETICAL-CALCULATION-CALIBRATED IN-SITU HIGH-T SXD EXPERIMENTS. IN THIS PROPOSED PROJECT, THEY WILL EXTEND THE METHOD TO DETERMINE EXPERIMENTALLY CONSTRAINED ?-FACTORS OF HEXACOORDINATED SI IN NON-QUENCHABLE DEEP-EARTH MINERALS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THEY WILL ALSO TACKLE CHALLENGES TO ESTABLISH AN EFFICIENT APPROACH TO DETERMINE ?-FACTORS IN SOLID SOLUTIONS BY THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS, WHICH ARE TO BE BENCHMARKED BY SXD EXPERIMENTS AND THUS ALLOWS THEM TO INVESTIGATE THE ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION OF HEXACOORDINATED TI IN DEEP-EARTH MINERALS. THEIR PROPOSED COMBINED APPROACH CIRCUMVENTS DIRECT THEORETICAL MODELING OF SOLID SOLUTIONS, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES COMPUTATIONAL COSTS. USING THE COMBINED APPROACHES OF EXPERIMENTS AND THEORETICAL MODELING, THE CORRECTION TO SI ?-FACTOR IN HYDROUS PHYLLOSILICATES INDUCED BY THE VIBRATIONAL ANHARMONICITY WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTALLY BENCHMARKED MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK TO ESTABLISH A HIGHLY ACCURATE YET EFFICIENT MODEL WILL ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE RELIABLE ESTIMATIONS OF SI ?-FACTOR IN ANHARMONIC MINERAL SYSTEMS. THOUGH THEY ONLY PROPOSE TO STUDY SELECT M?SSBAUER-INACTIVE ELEMENTS (SI & TI) IN THIS PROPOSAL, THE SAME APPROACH CAN BE EXTENDED TO OTHER ELEMENTS SUCH AS C, O, MG, AND CA.

THE POSTURE CAPTURE SYSTEM CAN BE USED IN A HEALTHCARE FACILITY OR HOME ENVIRONMENT FOR MONITORING PERSONS IN NEED OF PREVENTATIVE CARE, SUCH AS ELDERS AT HIGH RISK OF FALLING, DETECTING ABNORMAL BODY MOVEMENTS, AND ENHANCING TRAINING AND EVALUATION PROCESSES IN REHABILITATION SETTINGS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART OF WEARABLE SENSOR NETWORKS AND IOT SYSTEMS. THE PROJECT'S EDUCATION PLAN INCLUDES CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT, ENGAGING STUDENTS WITH HANDS-ON PROJECTS, AND PROMOTING PARTICIPATION OF UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS IN RESEARCH. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP RFID LOCALIZATION METHODS TO OBTAIN PRECISE POSITIONS OF ATTACHED RFID TAGS. THE POSTURE AND MOTION OF THE BODY CAN BE RECONSTRUCTED BY REGISTERING TAGS TO A SKELETAL MODEL. WITH THE CAPTURED POSTURE AND MOTION OF THE BODY, AN AI-BASED METHOD SHALL BE PROPOSED TO PROVIDE DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION. THE RESEARCH AGENDA INCLUDES: (I) CREATE A PROTOTYPE FOR THE RFID POSTURE SCANNER (RFPS); (II) ENABLING RFPS FOR A COMPLEX AND LARGE-SCALE ENVIRONMENT; (III) DEVELOPING AN INTELLIGENT TOOL FOR EXTRACTING HEALTHCARE DATA. THIS PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES A THOROUGH INTEGRATION AND ASSESSMENT PLAN TO TEST HOW THE PROPOSED SYSTEM CAN BE USED IN A HEALTHCARE FACILITY OR HOME ENVIRONMENT TO MONITOR PERSONS IN NEED OF PREVENTATIVE CARE.

THIS VEGETATION-FORCED EROSION AND DEPOSITION ON GRAVEL BARS IS IMPORTANT AS IT ALTERS THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE BED SEDIMENTS THAT AFFECTS AQUATIC AND RIPARIAN HABITAT QUALITY, DRIVES CHANGES IN SUBSURFACE HYDRAULICS AND ASSOCIATED WATER QUALITY, AS WELL AS IMPACTS FLOW CONVEYANCE AND COMMUNITY FLOOD RISK. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE HYDRAULICS AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT CAPACITY CHANGE THROUGH VEGETATION PATCHES TO EXPLAIN THE SPATIAL PATTERNS OF OBSERVED BED SEDIMENTS AND RESULTANT SHAPE OF GRAVEL BARS. THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGES IS EXPECTED TO DEPEND ON THE VEGETATION DENSITY WITHIN A PATCH. RESULTS CAN HELP GUIDE WATER AGENCIES IN DECIDING WHAT VEGETATION PLANTING DENSITIES ARE NECESSARY DURING RIVER RESTORATION ACTIVITIES TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED EVOLUTIONARY OUTCOMES. ADDITIONALLY, RESULTS ARE EXPECTED TO HELP FLOOD MANAGERS PREDICT GRAVEL BAR DIMENSIONS FROM EXISTING VEGETATION DENSITIES AND DETERMINE IF VEGETATION THINNING OR REMOVAL IS NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. PREDICTING VEGETATED BAR EVOLUTION IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE LOCAL HYDRAULICS AND SEDIMENT MOBILITY (INITIATION OF SEDIMENT MOTION) ARE SPATIALLY VARIABLE THROUGH A VEGETATION PATCH. CURRENTLY, NO SINGLE PARAMETER IS AVAILABLE TO PREDICT COARSE-SEDIMENT MOBILITY IN BOTH OPEN AND VEGETATED CHANNELS. HERE, A COMBINATION OF FIELDWORK AND LARGE-SCALE FLUME EXPERIMENTS WITH VEGETATION SIMULANTS WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A MECHANISTIC DRIVER OF COARSE-SEDIMENT MOBILITY THAT IS APPLICABLE IN BOTH VEGETATED AND UNVEGETATED CONDITIONS.

A MILLION TIMES FASTER COMPUTERS THAN TODAY'S MOST POWERFUL SUPERCOMPUTERS, OR, ELECTRICITY TRANSPORTED ACROSS THE NATIONAL GRID AT NO LOSS, IS THE SORT OF FUTURE THAT WILL BE REALIZED BY THE POWER OF QUANTUM MATERIALS. REALIZING THIS VISION REQUIRES DEVELOPING NEW MATERIALS AND UNDERSTANDING KEY MATERIALS FEATURES THAT GIVE RISE TO SUCH INCREDIBLE PROPERTIES. INTERFACIAL OXIDE MATERIALS, I.E., THOSE FORMED BY JOINING OF TWO DIFFERENT OXIDE MATERIALS, ARE ONE OF SUCH PROMISING MATERIALS. AN EXAMPLE OF AN INTERFACIAL OXIDE MATERIAL IS AN INTERFACE BETWEEN LANIO3 AND SRTIO3. BECAUSE THESE TWO MATERIALS HAVE DIFFERENT DISTANCES BETWEEN THEIR ATOMS, WHEN JOINED TO FORM AN INTERFACE, THEIR ATOMIC BONDS ARE STRAINED THAT CAN LEAD TO CREATION OF DEFECTS, I.E., LOSS OF SPECIFIC OXYGEN ATOMS. CREATION OF THESE DEFECTS HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO BE A KEY UNDERLYING REASON OF SUCH EXCITING PROPERTIES. IN THIS PROJECT, WE FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING THE CRITICAL CORRELATION BETWEEN STRAIN AND OXYGEN DEFECTS SUCH THAT THE DEFECTS COULD BE CONTROLLED, AT WILL. THIS WORK WILL ADVANCE WYOMING'S VISION OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES, DEVELOP BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF DESIGNING QUANTUM MATERIALS, AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE QUANTUM LEAP: LEADING THE NEXT QUANTUM REVOLUTION WHICH IS ONE OF THE NEXT TEN BIG NSF IDEAS. THE INTERFACE STRUCTURE FORMED BY JOINING TWO DIFFERENT COMPLEX OXIDES (CHEMICAL FORMULA ABO3) CONTAINS AN INTERFACIAL STRAIN WHICH LEADS TO FORMATION OF OXYGEN VACANCIES AT THE INTERFACE.

INITIALLY THOUGHT OF AS CELLULAR ?DUST? OR ?GARBAGE BAGS?, EVS HAVE NOW BEEN FOUND TO PLAY A ROLE IN A MYRIAD OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES, RANGING FROM MAINTAINING HOMEOSTASIS TO CANCER PROGRESSION. EVS CAN CARRY A RANGE OF CARGO, INCLUDING PROTEINS, LIPIDS, AND NUCLEIC ACIDS (SUCH AS DNA AND RNA), THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR DIVERSE FUNCTIONS. WHILE MUCH RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING THE SYNTHESIS AND RELEASE OF EVS FROM THE CELL, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON HOW CARGO GETS SORTED AND PACKAGED INTO EVS. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON THE RNA COMPONENT OF EVS AND SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE SELECTION, PACKAGING, AND TRANSPORT OF LINEAR AND CIRCULAR RNAS IN EVS. CIRCULAR RNAS HAVE A MULTITUDE OF REGULATORY FUNCTIONS, AND DYSREGULATION OF CIRCULAR RNA EXPRESSION HAS BEEN LINKED TO DISEASE OUTCOMES. OVERALL, THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF RNA TRANSPORT VIA EVS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO HAVE EDUCATIONAL IMPACT THROUGH TRAINING OF NEXT-GENERATION SCIENTISTS THROUGH RECRUITMENT STUDENTS AT MULTIPLE STAGES, INCLUDING K-12 STUDENTS, FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS, AND UNDERGRADUATES FROM LOW-INCOME FAMILIES.

MOREOVER, EVS HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN A WIDE SPECTRUM OF PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, AND THEY CAN SERVE AS IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN CELL-CELL COMMUNICATION. LEVERAGING THE PI'S PREVIOUS EXPERTISE WITH SINGLE-MOLECULE IMAGING SYSTEMS FOR STUDYING INTRACELLULAR TRANSPORT OF RNAS FROM THE NUCLEUS TO DISTANT SITES IN CELLS, THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE LONG-STANDING QUESTION OF HOW RNA CARGO IS SORTED AND PACKAGED INTO EVS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL THEORIES PROPOSED, BUT NONE OF THESE ARE SUBSTANTIATED WITH DIRECT VISUAL EVIDENCE. REPORTER CONSTRUCTS AND GENOME-WIDE RNA SEQUENCING OF EV RNA CARGO WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE HOW AND WHAT FACTORS GOVERN THE SELECTIVE PACKAGING OF RNA CARGO. THE ROLE OF EV SURFACE MARKER HETEROGENEITY IN RNA CARGO CONTENT WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED, AS WELL AS ITS EFFECT ON UPTAKE OF EVS BY RECIPIENT CELLS. THE ANALYSIS OF RNA SORTING, TRACKING OF RNA MOVEMENT INTO EVS, AND EVENTUAL TRANSFER OF RNAS INTO RECIPIENT CELLS WILL HELP TO UNCOVER THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RNA CARGO. USE OF IMAGING AT SINGLE-MOLECULE RESOLUTION WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST VISUAL VALIDATION OF SORTING AND DELIVERY PROCESSES AND WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS OF FUTURE ADVANCEMENTS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CELL-CELL COMMUNICATION, THEREBY ENABLING BETTER ENGINEERING OF EVS FOR THERAPY AND DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES.

AND (2) HOW DOES INCORPORATING DIVERSE WAYS OF KNOWING, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND ADVANCED MODELING LEAD TO MORE EQUITABLE AND RESILIENT E-W FUTURES? THE STATE OF IDAHO PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT TESTBED FOR THE PROJECT. THIS IS DUE TO THE FEATURES OF IDAHO?S LANDSCAPES, WHICH SPAN A RANGE OF GRADIENTS (E.G., HYDROLOGIC, TOPOGRAPHIC, DEMOGRAPHIC, JURISDICTIONAL) AND POPULATION DENSITIES (E.G., SMALL RURAL TOWNS AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES TO EXPANDING URBAN AREAS).

PROJECT IS FOR IOWA TO BECOME AN ADVANCED BIOMANUFACTURING LEADER BY ADAPTING AND MODERNIZING THE CONCEPT OF ?CHEMURGY? ? I.E., APPLIED CHEMISTRY WITH A FOCUS ON PRODUCING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS FROM AGRICULTURAL MATERIAL. THE PROJECT WILL ADVANCE THIS VISION BY BUILDING AND INTEGRATING RESEARCH CAPACITY IN BIOSCIENCES AND ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, TWO KEY AREAS IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF IOWA. CHEMURGY 2.0 WILL FOCUS ON THE MANUFACTURING OF PROTEINS, VACCINES AND THERAPEUTICS; THE MANUFACTURING OF BIOCHEMICALS AND BIOFIBERS; 3D-PRINTING AND COMPOSITE FABRICATION PROCESSES THAT UTILIZE BIOCHEMICALS AND BIOFIBERS; AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLASTICS FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING, FIBERS FOR FLEXIBLE AND RIGID MATERIALS, AND PROTEINS FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPEUTICS WILL BENEFIT SOCIETY BY PROVIDING BIO-BASED AND SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS FOR HEALTH AND CONSUMER APPLICATIONS. WITH THIS PROJECT, RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE IMPROVED NOT ONLY AT IOWA RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES BUT ALSO AT PREDOMINANTLY UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTIONS IN IOWA. RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE PROVIDED FOR PRESERVICE TEACHERS AND FOR UNDERGRADUATES FROM GROUPS TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED ?

CHEMURGY 2.0 WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA, THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN IOWA, DORDT UNIVERSITY, AND CENTRAL COLLEGE OF IOWA. THE CHEMURGY 2.0 RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL BUILD CAPACITY IN MEETING HUMAN NEEDS FROM THINGS THAT GROW IN THREE THEMATIC AREAS: (1) PLASTICS FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (PAM), (2) FIBERS FOR FLEXIBLE AND RIGID MATERIALS (FFR), AND (3) PROTEINS FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPEUTICS (PDT). THE STRUCTURE OF EACH THEMATIC AREA SUPPORTS A ?DISCOVER? ? ?OPTIMIZE? ? ?SCALE-UP-TO MANUFACTURE? PIPELINE THAT FORMS AN ITERATIVE AND INTERCONNECTED LOOP SPANNING FROM THE DISCOVERY OF BIO-INSPIRED BUILDING BLOCKS TO MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS. PAM LINKS THE BIOMANUFACTURING OF MONOMERS TO THE ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (AM) SECTOR. FFR LINKS BIOFIBERS TO AM, TEXTILES, AND MEDICAL PRODUCT MANUFACTURE. PDT FOCUSES ON LARGER BIO-DERIVED MOLECULES, SUCH AS PROTEINS AND CELL PRODUCTS, AND CONNECTS THEM WITH DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPEUTICS PRODUCTION. DATA SCIENCE IS A CROSS-CUTTING THEME THROUGHOUT ALL FOCAL AREAS. OVERALL, CHEMURGY 2.0 ADDRESSES THREE INTERSECTING PROBLEMS: BIOMANUFACTURING, WHICH IS UNDER-DEVELOPED IN IOWA RELATIVE TO OTHER SECTORS; THE CRITICAL PHYSICAL AND CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR BIOMANUFACUTRING THAT ARE CURRENTLY LACKING; AND WORKFORCE CAPACITY, WHICH IS SEVERELY CONSTRAINED IN THE STATE. CHEMURGY 2.0 IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE IN THE BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING FIELDS RELATED TO BIOMANUFACTURING AND DIGITAL INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES. DATA-DRIVEN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE STATE WILL INCREASE AND DIVERSIFY THE IOWA BIOMANUFACTURING WORKFORCE.

SOLAR CELLS CAN CONVERT SUNLIGHT DIRECTLY TO ELECTRICITY TO POWER ELECTRONIC DEVICES BY THE PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECT. CURRENTLY, STATE-OF-THE-ART SOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES, FOR EXAMPLE, SILICON SOLAR CELLS CANNOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF LOW COST AND HIGH ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCY TO ENABLE BROAD USE. ALTERNATIVELY, PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS (PSCS) REPRESENT A FAMILY OF PROMISING PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS FOR LOW-COST AND HIGH ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCY. TO DATE, PSCS HAVE ACHIEVED A CERTIFIED POWER CONVERSION EFFICIENCY OF 25.7% SINCE 2009. THE PEROVSKITE FILMS ARE PREDOMINANTLY PREPARED BY THE ANTISOLVENT-ASSISTED METHOD. THE ANTISOLVENT-ASSISTED METHOD IS NOT SUITABLE FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF HIGH REPRODUCIBILITY, LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION, AND LARGE-SIZE DEVICES. THIS EXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH (EIR) PROJECT ADDRESSES THE USE OF VOLATILE SOLVENTS TO PREPARE HIGH-EFFICIENCY PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS BY A NON-ANTISOLVENT METHOD. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH METHOD EXHIBITS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL IN THE FABRICATION OF HIGH-QUALITY PEROVSKITE FILMS BECAUSE THE FILM GROWTH IS CAUSED BY SOLVENT VOLATILIZATION VIA A SPONTANEOUSLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY SUPERSATURATED NUCLEATION STRATEGY. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PEROVSKITE PRECURSOR PREPARED AND ADJUSTED BY VOLATILE SOLVENTS AND ADDITIVES TO CONTROL THE HIGH-QUALITY PEROVSKITE FILM GROWTH VIA A NON-ANTISOLVENT METHOD.

OWN BELIEFS AND BEHAVIORS MATCH THE NORMS OF BROADER SOCIETY. ANTHROPOLOGISTS HAVE LONG BEEN INTERESTED IN THE EFFECTS OF CULTURAL CONSONANCE, ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO ITS ABILITY TO BUFFER INDIVIDUALS AGAINST ADVERSITY. ONE INTRIGUING BUT UNDER-STUDIED EXTENSION OF THIS RELATIONSHIP IS THAT ONE PERSON?S CULTURAL CONSONANCE CAN AFFECT OTHERS WHO DEPEND ON THEM. THIS PROJECT TESTS THIS PROPOSITION BY INVESTIGATING WHETHER CHILDREN OF PARENTS WITH HIGH CULTURAL CONSONANCE ARE ALSO BUFFERED FROM ADVERSITY. IT DOES SO IN CONTEXTS OF EXTREME POVERTY, WHERE EVEN MARGINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS CAN HAVE LARGE EFFECTS ON CHILD WELL-BEING.

THIS PROJECT IS JOINTLY FUNDED BY THE CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY PROGRAM AND THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR). THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND QUESTIONNAIRES, THE RESEARCHERS GATHER DATA FROM CAREGIVERS OF CHILDREN AGES 2 TO 5 WHO LIVE IN POVERTY AND FROM THEIR CHILDREN. FIRST, THEY WILL ANALYZE IF CAREGIVERS WHO LIVE ACCORDING TO SHARED CULTURAL VALUES PROMOTE STIMULATING ACTIVITIES AND POSITIVE DISCIPLINE AMONG THEIR CHILDREN MORE FREQUENTLY THAN OTHER CAREGIVERS. TO STUDY THIS ASSOCIATION, THEY WILL COLLECT DATA FROM 100 CAREGIVERS AND THEIR CHILDREN AND ANALYZE THEM USING RIGOROUS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS.

THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF MANY VISUAL ILLUSIONS. OTHER TIMES, HOWEVER, WHAT WE VISUALLY EXPERIENCE DEPENDS ON HOW WE PROCESS INCOMING VISUAL STIMULI. FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN EVEN SEE WHAT WE INTEND TO SEE, AS WHEN WE CHOOSE TO SEE THE FORMS OF ANIMALS OR FACES IN CLOUDS IN THE SKY. SO, OUR INTENTIONS CAN PLAY A ROLE IN VISUAL PERCEPTION. ATTENTION IS ALSO INFLUENTIAL IN HOW WE SEE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO NOTICE DETAILS ABOUT THE THINGS TO WHICH WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION. ATTENTION IS NOT IN THE WORLD OR IN THE ?BOTTOM-UP? VISUAL STIMULUS, BUT IS A ?TOP-DOWN? FOCUSING MECHANISM IN OUR BRAIN THAT ENABLES US TO SELECTIVELY ATTEND TO THE MOST RELEVANT INCOMING STIMULI. PERCEPTION CAN THEREFORE BE INFLUENCED BY BOTH ?TOP-DOWN? ATTENTION AND ?TOP-DOWN? INTENTIONS. WE CALL THIS ?TOP-DOWN? PROCESSING BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE IS NOT SOLELY DRIVEN BY WHAT IS IN THE ?BOTTOM-UP? SENSORY INPUT. IT IS ALSO AFFECTED BY WHERE OUR ATTENTION IS FOCUSED, AND BY THE NATURE OF OUR EXPECTATIONS AND INTENTIONS. ONE EXAMPLE OF A KIND OF VISUAL INPUT THAT IS DRIVEN BY TOP-DOWN PROCESSING IS SO-CALLED ?APPARENT MOTION.? ONE EXAMPLE OCCURS WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND SEE TWO FLASHING LIGHTS ALIGNED DIAGONALLY, ON OPPOSITE CORNERS OF AN IMAGINARY SQUARE. WHEN THESE TURN OFF, TWO DIFFERENT LIGHTS TURN ON AT THE OTHER TWO CORNERS OF THE INVISIBLE SQUARE. WHEN THE TWO LIGHT CONFIGURATIONS TOGGLE ON AND OFF SEQUENTIALLY, YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE AN ILLUSION OF APPARENT MOTION AND SEE THE FLASHED LIGHTS APPEAR TO JUMP BACK AND FORTH, EVEN THOUGH THE LIGHTS ARE STATIONARY AT ANY GIVEN TIME. INTERESTINGLY, SOME PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY SEE APPARENT MOTION IN THE HORIZONTAL DIRECTION, WHILE OTHERS SEE APPARENT VERTICAL MOTION BETWEEN THE LIGHTS WHEN THEY FLASH ON AND OFF IN PAIRS, EVEN WHEN NO LIGHTBULBS ARE ACTUALLY MOVING AT ALL. WHAT IS EVEN MORE FASCINATING, IS THAT PEOPLE CAN OFTEN CONSCIOUSLY DECIDE WHETHER THEY SUBSEQUENTLY SEE ILLUSORY VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL MOTION, SO THEIR INTENTION CAN SHAPE THEIR PERCEPTION OF THIS APPARENT MOTION ILLUSION. A CENTRAL QUESTION DRIVING THIS RESEARCH IS HOW A ?TOP-DOWN? INTENTION TO SEE VERTICAL VS HORIZONTAL MOTION IS REALIZED IN THE BRAIN. THE EXPERIMENTS IN THIS PROJECT ARE DESIGNED TO UNRAVEL THE NEURAL MECHANISMS THAT CAN LEAD TO THIS VOLUNTARY RESHAPING OF PERCEPTION. SUBJECTS PERFORM THESE PERCEPTUAL EXPERIMENTS WHILE THEIR BRAINS ARE BEING IMAGED NON-INVASIVELY, USING FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI), SO THAT BRAIN ACTIVITY CAN BE MONITORED WHILE SUBJECTS ENGAGE IN THE TASK. VISUAL PERCEPTION EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED IN THE SCANNER WITH HUMAN SUBJECTS WHO ARE INSTRUCTED TO TRY TO SEE EITHER VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL MOTION, AND THEN SWITCH DIRECTIONS WHEN CUED. THERE ARE VISUAL MOTION PROCESSING AREAS IN THE CORTEX OF THE BRAIN, WITH DIFFERENT SUB-AREAS ENCODING VERTICAL VERSUS HORIZONTAL MOTION DIRECTIONS. AFTER COLLECTING FMRI DATA, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ANALYZE BRAIN IMAGES TO PRECISELY LOCATE THOSE BRAIN AREAS THAT ALLOW PREDICTIONS OF A SUBJECT?S INTENTION: I.E. WHETHER SUBJECTS WERE INTENDING TO SEE HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL MOTION, BEFORE ANY MOTION TOOK PLACE IN THE STIMULUS. BASED ON BRAIN ACTIVITY, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO DECIPHER WHAT MOTION THEY WOULD ACTUALLY END UP PERCEIVING, GIVEN THEIR INTENTION TO SEE HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL MOTION. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH IS TO DISCOVER WHAT AREAS OF THE BRAIN ALLOW US TO DECODE THESE VISUAL INTENTIONS, AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW TOP-DOWN PROCESSING WORKS IN THE BRAIN FOR ALL FORMS OF SENSORY PERCEPTION.

IN THIS COLLABORATIVE US-ISRAEL PROJECT, RESEARCHERS INVESTIGATE THE NEURAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH LEARNING CAN BE ENHANCED FOR BOTH VISUAL AND MOTOR SKILL LEARNING AND STUDY WHETHER OFFLINE PROCESSING DURING SLEEP COMPENSATES FOR THE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF TRAINING (BY ONLY A FEW TRIALS OF TASK REACTIVATION) DURING WAKEFULNESS. IN ADDITION TO MONITORING THE LEARNING PROGRESS OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE STUDY, THEIR BRAIN ACTIVITY DURING SLEEP AND THEIR BRAIN NEUROCHEMISTRY WILL ALSO BE MEASURED. SPECIFICALLY, THIS STUDY EXAMINES NEUROCHEMICAL PROCESSING RELATED TO BRAIN PLASTICITY BY NON-INVASIVELY MEASURING A RATIO BETWEEN EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY NEUROTRANSMITTERS IN THE BRAIN (E/I RATIO) USING MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY. THE RESULTS MAY REVEAL HOW BRIEF EXPOSURE TO LEARNED INFORMATION VIA TASK REACTIVATION CAN REPLACE EXTENSIVE TRAINING, UNCOVER THE BASIC BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN MECHANISMS LINKING TASK REACTIVATION AND SLEEP, AND USE THAT KNOWLEDGE TO DEVELOP BETTER METHODS FOR MORE EFFICIENT SENSORY AND MOTOR SKILL LEARNING.

HER STUDY MAKES USE OF DATA FROM THE USARRAY, AN NSF-FUNDED NATIONAL EXPERIMENT IN WHICH A DENSE NETWORK OF SEISMOMETERS WAS LEFT OUT TO RECORD EARTHQUAKES FOR YEARS AT A TIME. IN ADDITION TO A THOROUGH 'CATALOGUE' OF CEUS EARTHQUAKES (SIZE, TIMING AND LOCATION), THE US ARRAY HAS PROVIDED NEW INFORMATION ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE SUBSURFACE. DR.

NEW MEMORIES ARE FRAGILE, AND HAVE TO BE STRENGTHENED AND REORGANIZED IN ORDER TO LAST. IT IS KNOWN THAT MEMORIES ARE STRENGTHENED AT THE END OF THE DAY DURING SLEEP. HOWEVER, THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS PROCESS OF MEMORY STRENGTHENING, CALLED ?CONSOLIDATION?, MIGHT HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY, DURING SECONDS-LONG PERIODS WHEN WE ZONE OUT, RELAX AND REST DURING OUR DAILY LIVES. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES PRECISELY HOW THESE WAKING ZONE-OUT PERIODS ARE ABLE TO IMPROVE MEMORY. WHEN WE SLEEP AFTER LEARNING, NEW MEMORIES ARE REPEATEDLY REACTIVATED IN THE BRAIN, INCREMENTALLY STRENGTHENING MEMORY TRACES OVER TIME. THE RESEARCH IN THIS PROJECT TESTS WHETHER THIS SAME PROCESS OF MEMORY REACTIVATION AND STRENGTHENING EXPLAINS HOW SHORT ZONE-OUT PERIODS ARE ABLE TO IMPROVE MEMORY DURING WAKEFULNESS. IT IS POSSIBLE TO MEASURE THIS PROCESS BY USING EEG (ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY), A NON-INVASIVE BRAIN IMAGING TECHNIQUE, COMBINED WITH MEASURES OF PUPIL SIZE, THOUGHT AND BEHAVIOR. THE PROJECT HAS TWO MAIN GOALS: FIRST, THE PROJECT INVESTIGATES WHETHER MEMORIES ARE REACTIVATED AND STRENGTHENED DURING SECONDS-LONG PERIODS OF WAKING REST, IN A SIMILAR WAY IN WHICH THEY ARE REACTIVATED AND CONSOLIDATED DURING SLEEP. SECOND, THE RESEARCH IN THIS PROJECT EXPLORES HOW MEMORY CONSOLIDATION DURING WAKING REST WORKS TOGETHER SYNERGISTICALLY WITH SLEEP TO IMPROVE MEMORY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO TEST THE WORKING HYPOTHESIS THAT REST AND SLEEP ACT IN SEQUENCE, WITH SLEEP BEING REQUIRED TO FULLY CONSOLIDATE AND STRENGTHEN AN INITIAL MEMORY BOOST THAT HAPPENS DURING WAKEFULNESS.

CENTREX IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO DETECT EVIDENCE FOR NEW TYPES OF FUNDAMENTAL FORCES AND PARTICLES, THROUGH PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE SIGNALS FROM NUCLEI EMBEDDED IN THE POLAR MOLECULE THALLIUM FLUORIDE. THE GOAL OF THE CENTREX EXPERIMENT IS TO DETECT A PARTICULAR DEFORMATION IN THE SHAPE OF AN ATOMIC NUCLEUS, KNOWN AS A NUCLEAR SCHIFF MOMENT. THIS WILL ADVANCE THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE BECAUSE A SCHIFF MOMENT ALONG THE SPIN AXIS OF A NUCLEUS CAN ARISE ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS THAT ARE NOT SYMMETRIC UNDER REVERSAL OF THE DIRECTION OF TIME. INTERACTIONS OF THIS TYPE CAN BE MEDIATED BY NEW, AS-YET UNDETECTED, PARTICLES THAT ARE PREDICTED TO OCCUR IN SOME THEORETICAL MODELS THAT EXTEND THE CURRENT STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS. A SCHIFF MOMENT OF SIZE LARGE ENOUGH TO BE DETECTED WITH THE PROJECTED SENSITIVITY CENTREX COULD INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF NEW PARTICLES WITH MASS WELL ABOVE THAT OF THE HEAVIEST KNOWN PARTICLES - AND EVEN BEYOND THE REACH OF THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER (LHC). HENCE, CENTREX WILL PROVIDE ONE OF THE FEW KNOWN WAYS TO SEARCH FOR PHYSICS BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICLES TOO MASSIVE TO BE CREATED AT THE LHC. AN EXPERIMENT WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY POTENTIAL OF CENTREX CAN ALSO CAPTURE THE INTEREST OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND RAISE THE LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT SCIENCE. IN ADDITION, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE CENTREX APPARATUS WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING SEVERAL YOUNG SCIENTISTS IN INSTRUMENTATION DEVELOPMENT. THIS TYPE OF PRECISION MEASUREMENT SCIENCE EXPOSES STUDENTS TO A WIDE RANGE OF INTELLECTUAL AND TECHNICAL SUBFIELDS, AND PROVIDES UNUSUALLY BROAD TRAINING IN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS THAT BENEFITS DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCIENTIFIC WORKFORCE OF THE NATION. THE EXISTENCE OF AN ASYMMETRIC CHARGE DISTRIBUTION SUCH AS AN ELECTRIC DIPOLE MOMENT (EDM) OR A SCHIFF MOMENT (SM) ALONG A PARTICLE'S ANGULAR MOMENTUM AXIS REQUIRES VIOLATION OF TIME REVERSAL (T) SYMMETRY, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO THE MORE WIDELY-DISCUSSED PHENOMENON OF CP VIOLATION. OBSERVATION OF AN EDM OR SM WITHIN A FEW ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE OF CURRENT LIMITS WOULD BE EVIDENCE FOR PHENOMENA OUTSIDE THE STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS THEORY. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE STRONG MOTIVATIONS FROM PARTICLE THEORY AND COSMOLOGY TO EXPECT AN EDM OR SM IN THIS EXPERIMENTALLY-ACCESSIBLE RANGE. DISCOVERY OF AN EDM OR SM COULD ILLUMINATE THE MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OBSERVED MATTER-ANTIMATTER ASYMMETRY OF THE UNIVERSE, WHICH REMAINS ONE OF THE GRAND CHALLENGES OF COSMOLOGY AND PARTICLE PHYSICS. MOREOVER, NEW PHYSICS AT THE TEV SCALE (THE RANGE OF ENERGY NOT BEING EXPLORED AT THE LHC), CARRYING NEW CP-VIOLATING PHASES, NATURALLY GIVE RISE TO EDM AND SM NEAR THE CURRENT EXPERIMENTAL LIMITS. HENCE ANY ADVANCE IN SENSITIVITY TO SMS PUSHES THE FRONTIER OF PARTICLE PHYSICS IN A MANNER COMPLEMENTARY TO CURRENT EFFORTS AT THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER. THE CENTREX APPARATUS WILL BE DEVELOPED BY INTEGRATING A WIDE ARRAY OF SUBSYSTEMS - MANY CUSTOM DESIGNED AND BUILT - INCLUDING VACUUM SYSTEMS, A MOLECULAR BEAM SOURCE, LASERS, OPTICAL CONTROL AND DETECTION SYSTEMS, MICROWAVE CONTROL AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS, PRECISE MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND HIGH VOLTAGE SYSTEMS. THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF CENTREX BUILDS FROM RECENT ADVANCES USING THE PROPERTIES OF DIATOMIC MOLECULES TO AMPLIFY SIGNALS DUE TO NEW FUNDAMENTAL FORCES, AND IN PRECISELY DETECTING AND MANIPULATING MOLECULES. THIS NOVEL APPARATUS WILL USE A CRYOGENIC BEAM OF DIATOMIC MOLECULES TO MAKE THE WORLD'S MOST SENSITIVE MEASUREMENT OF A SM.

ALLOSTERY IS THE ALTERING OF ENZYME FUNCTION AT ONE SITE DUE TO A PERTURBATION OF THE ENZYME AT A DISTAL SITE. DESPITE OVER A CENTURY OF WORK ON THIS TOPIC, TWO KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED: (1) WHAT ARE THE ATOMIC-LEVEL CHANGES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ALLOSTERY IN A COMPLETE FOUR-STATE THERMODYNAMIC CYCLE? (2) CAN WE HARNESS THE ATOMIC-LEVEL ALLOSTERIC MECHANISMS TO IDENTIFY NEW TARGETS TO IMPACT THE OBSERVED ALLOSTERY? THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS USING TWO PYRUVATE KINASE ISOZYMES AS MODEL SYSTEMS. THE K-TYPE ALLOSTERIC RESPONSE OF THESE ENZYMES IS A PIVOTAL CONTROL VALVE FOR THE LAST STEP IN GLYCOLYSIS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO DEVELOP AND FREELY DISTRIBUTE ONLINE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK-BASED CHEMISTRY LESSONS.

CURRENTLY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ALGAL AND NON-ALGAL SPECIES OR HOW THEY RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES SNOW ALGAL COMMUNITY IN MONTANA USING A BOTTOM-UP APPROACH, FIRST CHARACTERIZING THE MAKEUP OF SNOW ALGAL COMMUNITIES AND ISOLATING MEMBERS FOR CONTROLLED LABORATORY GROWTH EXPERIMENTS, LEADING TO DEVELOPMENT OF A MODEL DETAILING HOW INDIVIDUAL SPECIES CONTRIBUTE TO COMMUNITY GROWTH. BY SAMPLING SNOW ALGAL COMMUNITIES IN THE SAME LOCATIONS OVER FIVE YEARS, THIS PROJECT WILL GATHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE SEASONAL AND ANNUAL DYNAMICS OF SNOW ALGAE. THIS CAREER PROJECT WILL INVOLVE NATIONAL FOREST AND PARK PARTNERSHIPS, INTEGRATE UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM, AND ENGAGE RURAL MONTANA MIDDLE SCHOOLS WITH THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS AND UNDERLYING SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS.

MOST MATERIALS HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT STABLE CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES, EACH WITH A CHARACTERISTIC SET OF PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. CARBON, WHICH CAN FORM GRAPHITE (FLAKY, BLACK MATERIAL USED IN PENCILS) OR DIAMOND (HARD, COLORLESS GEMSTONE) STRUCTURES, IS A WELL-KNOWN EXAMPLE. SOLID-SOLID TRANSITIONS THAT OCCUR BETWEEN DIFFERENT CRYSTALLINE FORMS OF THE SAME COMPOUND ARE UBIQUITOUS AND IMPORTANT PHENOMENA. THEY CAN LEAD TO A WIDE VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS SUCH AS DIAMOND AND STEEL PRODUCTION, SYNTHESIS OF CERAMIC MATERIALS, THERMAL ENERGY HARVESTING AND STORAGE, REWRITABLE OPTICAL DATA STORAGE, AND NONVOLATILE ELECTRONIC MEMORIES. HISTORICALLY, CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN UNDERSTANDING SOLID-SOLID TRANSITIONS FROM THERMODYNAMICS CONCERNING THE RELATIVE PHASE STABILITY (THE ?DRIVING FORCE? FOR THE PHASE TRANSITION), REGARDLESS OF TRANSITION PATHS BETWEEN THE INITIAL AND FINAL STRUCTURES. HOWEVER, THE KINETICS THAT DICTATES WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSITION CAN OCCUR IN PRACTICE UNDER GIVEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND WHICH PATH THE TRANSITION LIKELY TAKES PLACE REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THIS PROJECT WILL ADVANCE THE ATOMIC-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING OF KINETICS UNDERLYING SOLID-SOLID TRANSITIONS WITHOUT USING EMPIRICAL DATA AND DEVELOP AN ADVANCED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHOD FOR THE FAST AND ACCURATE PREDICTION OF KINETIC BARRIERS THAT CONTROL SOLID-SOLID TRANSITION IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTS.

THIS PROJECT WILL ADVANCE ATOMIC-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING OF KINETICS OF SOLID-SOLID PHASE TRANSITIONS USING A COMBINED METHOD OF MODERN FIRST-PRINCIPLES ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE THEORY CALCULATIONS, QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL BOND ANALYSIS, AND MACHINE LEARNING. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO (I) IDENTIFY PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES AND STRUCTURAL MOTIFS THAT CONTROL KINETIC BARRIERS OF POLYMORPHIC TRANSITIONS FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES, AND (II) DEVELOP A BOTTOM-UP PHYSICS-DRIVEN MACHINE LEARNING METHOD FOR THE FAST AND ACCURATE PREDICTION OF TRANSITION BARRIERS.

THE BROADER IMPACTS INCLUDE ENGAGING K12 STUDENTS IN SOUTH DAKOTA IN RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. FINALLY, THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN UNDERGRADUATE BIOINFORMATICS CURRICULUM THAT FOCUSES ON QUANTITATIVE REASONING AND PROGRAMMING SKILLS. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE HOW INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC REPRODUCTIVE BARRIERS CONTRIBUTE TO SPECIES ISOLATION BY EXAMINING THE CELLULAR REGULATORY DYSFUNCTION IN HYBRIDS OF TWO MILKWEEDS, ASCLEPIAS SYRIACA AND A. SPECIOSA. THE STUDY WILL FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING THE CELLULAR REGULATORY NETWORKS AND STRESS-RESPONSE METABOLISM OF EACH SPECIES IN PARENTAL ENVIRONMENTS AND CHARACTERIZING THE DIVERSITY OF HYBRID CELLULAR EXPRESSION AND ITS IMPACT ON FITNESS. THE RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH RNA-SEQUENCING AND QUANTIFICATION OF STRESS METABOLITES IN ROOT AND LEAF TISSUE. THE BROADER IMPACTS ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE RESEARCH WITH EXPERIMENTS IN COMMON GARDENS AT K12 SCHOOLS ACROSS SOUTH DAKOTA TO QUANTIFY THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PRE- AND POSTZYGOTIC BARRIERS TO REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION. FURTHER INTEGRATION OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL AIMS WILL INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UNDERGRADUATE BIOINFORMATICS CURRICULUM THAT FOCUSES ON QUANTITATIVE REASONING, MODELING, AND SIMULATION, AND APPLYING THE PROCESS OF SCIENCE VIA PROGRAMMING IN R. THIS RESEARCH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING GENE INTERACTIONS AND THE TYPES OF INCOMPATIBILITIES THAT ARISE DURING SPECIES ISOLATION, WHICH WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN DISTURBANCES SHIFT SPECIES RANGES AND BRING PREVIOUSLY ISOLATED SPECIES INTO CONTACT.

THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE REGULATION OF THESE PROCESSES IN TWO DIFFERENT VIRUSES. UNDERSTANDING OF THIS REGULATION PROCESS IN GREATER DETAIL WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO USE IT TO EXERT CONTROL OVER VIRUSES, BOTH TO INHIBIT VIRAL INFECTION AND TO RE-PURPOSE VIRAL STRUCTURES FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY. TO ENSURE THAT VIRUSES HAVE THE TOOLS NECESSARY FOR THESE PROCESSES WHILE STILL MAINTAINING A SMALL GENOME, SOME VIRUSES ENCODE PROTEIN DOMAINS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS. INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED PROTEIN (IDP) DOMAINS, FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGE SHAPE TO PERFORM DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES A KEY MECHANISM ENABLING IDP DOMAINS TO SWITCH BETWEEN FUNCTIONAL SHAPES, WHICH IS MODIFICATION OF THE PROTEIN WITH PHOSPHATE, A PROCESS CALLED PHOSPHORYLATION. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO ENGAGE MULTIPLE UNDER-SERVED POPULATIONS AND MOTIVATE THEM TO LEARN MORE ABOUT VIRUSES AND HOW COMPUTERS ARE USED TO STUDY THEM THROUGH DIFFERENT TYPES OF OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. RESEARCHERS WILL DEVELOP SOFTWARE TO ENABLE STUDENTS WHO ARE BLIND TO PARTICIPATE IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, UPDATE UNDERGRADUATE COURSES WITH HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS MODULES TO IMPROVE INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING OF BIOCHEMISTS, AND LEVERAGE CROCHET TO ENGAGE STUDENTS, ADULTS, AND NON-SCIENTISTS ALIKE IN LEARNING ABOUT VIRUS STRUCTURE AND RESEARCH. PHOSPHORYLATION HAS BEEN IMPLICATED AS A KEY REGULATOR OF CAPSID FUNCTION IN VIRUSES, BUT THE MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS OF THIS PHENOMENA HAVE NOT BEEN ELUCIDATED. FOR EXAMPLE, HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV, A HUMAN VIRUS THAT INFECTS LIVER TISSUE) AND BROME MOSAIC VIRUS (BMV, A PLANT VIRUS THAT INFECTS CEREAL CROPS) CAPSIDS BOTH CONTAIN MULTI-FUNCTIONAL IDPS THAT UNDERGO DIFFERENTIAL, REVERSIBLE PHOSPHORYLATION. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT VARIABLE PHOSPHORYLATION PATTERNS CONTROL THE CONFORMATIONAL ENSEMBLES OF THE IDPS. HOWEVER, OWING TO INTRINSIC DISORDER, ATOMISTIC STRUCTURES OF THE IDPS HAVE NOT BEEN RESOLVED, IMPEDING CHARACTERIZATION OF STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS. THIS PROJECT WILL USE ATOMISTIC MODELING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS TO ESTABLISH THE ROLE OF PHOSPHORYLATION PATTERNS IN REGULATING SPECIFIC RNA RECOGNITION FOR GENOME PACKAGING, THE MECHANISM AND TIMING OF INTRACELLULAR TRAFFICKING SIGNAL DISPLAY, AND INTERACTIONS REQUIRED FOR THE INFILTRATION OF HOST ORGANELLES, NAMELY THE NUCLEUS FOR HBV AND THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM FOR BMV. BY CATALOGING THE EFFECTS OF PHOSPHATES ON VIRAL IDPS IN TERMS OF CONFORMATION, DYNAMICS, AND BINDING INTERACTIONS, WE CAN BEGIN TO ESTABLISH THE RULES OF PHOSPHO-REGULATION AS UTILIZED BY VIRUSES FOR GENOME ENCAPSIDATION AND HOST CELL MANIPULATION.

BACKHAUL IS THE NETWORK LINK THAT MOVES MASSIVE DATA STREAMS AT HIGH SPEED BETWEEN TWO POINTS, SUPPORTING LARGE SUBNETWORKS OF MOBILE AND FIXED-LOCATION USERS. NORMALLY OPTICAL FIBERS CARRY BACKHAUL DATA, BUT FIBER DEPLOYMENT IS NOT ALWAYS VIABLE; WIRELESS BACKHAUL PROVIDES THE HIGH-SPEED ALTERNATIVE AND SOLUTION. 6G WILL BE THE FIRST GENERATION OF WIDELY DEPLOYED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION THAT HAS DATA RATES COMPARABLE TO FIBER OPTICS, HERALDING IMPORTANT BENEFITS TO OUR NATION AND SOCIETY. RURAL AND REMOTE POPULATIONS MAY ESPECIALLY BENEFIT FROM WIRELESS BACKHAUL, SINCE IT SUPPORTS BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY (HELPING TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE) WHERE FIBER DEPLOYMENT IS COST PROHIBITIVE. WIRELESS BACKHAUL WOULD ALSO ENABLE TEMPORARY HIGH-SPEED NETWORKS CRITICAL TO OPERATIONS IN MOBILE MILITARY UNITS, NATURAL DISASTER RECOVERIES, OR SEASONAL ENDEAVORS, SUCH AS SMART AND CONNECTED FARMING. EVEN THE FIBER-DOMINATED NETWORKS IN URBAN CENTERS MAY ECONOMICALLY AND LOGISTICALLY BENEFIT FROM THE HIGH FLEXIBILITY AND RELATIVELY LOW INSTALLATION COST OF WIRELESS BACKHAUL SEGMENTS. FURTHER, 6G WIRELESS BACKHAUL WILL STRATEGICALLY LEVERAGE THE LONG-UNDERUTILIZED TERAHERTZ SPECTRUM BETWEEN 0.1-10 THZ. REALIZING UBIQUITOUS 6G NETWORKS WILL REQUIRE MUCH NEW RESEARCH, BUT TERAHERTZ BACKHAUL IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL UTILIZE A COMBINATION OF UNIQUE EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS, THEORETICAL MODELS, AND NEW DEVICE DESIGNS TO FILL KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF TERAHERTZ BACKHAUL PERFORMANCE UNDER REAL-WORLD CONDITIONS. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED WILL ESTABLISH THE CRITICAL FOUNDATIONS UPON WHICH FUTURE 6G SYSTEMS CAN BE INTELLIGENTLY ENGINEERED AND OPTIMIZED. MOREOVER, THIS WORK WILL TRAIN A NEW GENERATION OF STUDENTS, FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO GRADUATE LEVELS, INSPIRED TO WORK IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND CAPABLE OF ADVANCING THE HIGHLY COMPLEX WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND SENSING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FUTURE. TO DATE, EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS OF TERAHERTZ COMMUNICATION ARE STILL VERY RARE, LEAVING NUMEROUS SCIENTIFIC GAPS IN THE HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF THE ATMOSPHERE, ANTENNA POINTING, WEATHER, AND TURBULENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN EMPLOYING THE BACKHAUL REQUIREMENTS OF ULTRAWIDE BANDWIDTH AND LONG DISTANCE. THIS DEARTH OF MEASUREMENTS FURTHER LEADS TO AN INABILITY TO PROPERLY VALIDATE COMPREHENSIVE THEORETICAL MODELS USED IN SYSTEM ENGINEERING. THE PROJECT GOALS AND SCOPE INVOLVE THREE THRUSTS: 1. TO MEASURE REAL TERAHERTZ BACKHAUL LINKS AND ENABLE GAP ISSUES TO BE STUDIED AND PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD; 2. TO USE EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS AS THE VALIDATION STANDARD UPON WHICH THEORETICAL CHANNEL MODELS CAN BE CORRECTED AND MADE MORE COMPREHENSIVE; 3. TO DEVELOP MULTI-FUNCTIONAL REFLECTARRAYS, WHICH ARE DEVICES THAT CAN ACTIVELY CORRECT ? IN SITU ? TERAHERTZ COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS SUCH AS ANTENNA POINTING, TURBULENCE, AND BEAM DISTORTION. THE MEASUREMENT METHOD WILL RELY ON A UNIQUE NSF-FUNDED SUITE OF TERAHERTZ SYSTEMS THAT ARE PURPOSELY BUILT TO ENABLE SENSITIVE, LONG-DISTANCE, ULTRAWIDE BANDWIDTH OPERATIONS, BOTH INDOORS AND OUTDOORS. THE THEORETICAL MODELING WILL BE EXTENDED TO ACCOUNT FOR BACKHAUL-UNIQUE PROPERTIES, SUCH AS ULTRAWIDE BANDWIDTH, AND TO UNIFY THE VARIOUS PHYSICAL MECHANISMS INTO A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE TOOL BY WHICH BACKHAUL SYSTEM BEHAVIOR CAN BE PREDICTED IN ANY PRACTICAL CIRCUMSTANCE. REFLECTARRAYS WILL BE DESIGNED BY ADVANCING ARTIFICIAL ELECTROMAGNETIC MATERIAL CONCEPTS FOR BACKHAUL SPECIFIC PURPOSES.

WITHIN THIS SUBJECT LIES THE THEORY OF KNOTS, LOOPS OF TANGLED STRING THAT ARE TIED TOGETHER AT THEIR ENDS, WHICH HAS VARIOUS CONNECTIONS TO PHYSICS (VIA QUANTUM THEORY AND STRING THEORY), CHEMISTRY (VIA MOLECULAR KNOTS), AND BIOLOGY (VIA DNA STRUCTURE, WITH APPLICATIONS TO DRUG DESIGN). TO BETTER UNDERSTAND KNOTS AND OTHER GEOMETRIC OBJECTS, TOPOLOGISTS HAVE INVENTED TOOLS CALLED INVARIANTS. SOME MODERN INVARIANTS ARE INSPIRED BY THEORETICAL PHYSICS, SUCH AS GAUGE THEORY. ON THE ONE HAND, THESE INVARIANTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO SOLVE MANY IMPORTANT AND LONG-STANDING QUESTIONS IN TOPOLOGY; ON THE OTHER HAND, THEIR BEHAVIORS ARE FAR FROM ENTIRELY UNDERSTOOD. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS TO FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN INVARIANTS IN TERMS OF BOTH THEORY AND COMPUTATION, HARNESSING THEIR POWER TO EXPLORE THE LINK BETWEEN LOW-DIMENSIONAL TOPOLOGY AND CONTACT GEOMETRY, A RELATED AREA OF MATHEMATICS THAT HAS ITS ROOTS IN NEWTONIAN MECHANICS AND THAT HAS EMERGED AS AN EXCITING AREA OF RESEARCH IN RECENT YEARS. AS PART OF THIS PROJECT, THE INVESTIGATOR WILL PROVIDE RESEARCH TRAINING TO UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, MAKE MODERN INVARIANTS ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDE AUDIENCE, AND CONTINUE EFFORTS IN MATHEMATICAL OUTREACH. FLOER THEORY, WHICH ENCOMPASSES INSTANTON, MONOPOLE, AND HEEGAARD FLOER HOMOLOGIES, IS A LARGE PACKAGE OF INVARIANTS FOR THREE-MANIFOLDS AND KNOTS, AS WELL AS THEIR COBORDISMS, THAT ORIGINATE FROM GAUGE THEORY AND SYMPLECTIC GEOMETRY.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO HARNESS THE POWER OF FLOER INVARIANTS THAT COMES FROM COMBINING THEORY AND COMPUTATION, IN SEVERAL RELATED DIRECTIONS. FIRST, FLOER THEORY PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE EXISTENCE OR NON-EXISTENCE OF COBORDISMS BETWEEN THREE-MANIFOLDS AND BETWEEN KNOTS, WITH TOPOLOGICAL OR GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS. IT IS ALSO KNOWN TO BE CLOSELY RELATED TO CONTACT GEOMETRY, GIVING RISE TO INVARIANTS THAT CERTIFY TIGHTNESS OF A CONTACT THREE-MANIFOLD, AND DISTINGUISH SMOOTHLY ISOTOPIC KNOTS THAT ARE NOT LEGENDRIAN ISOTOPIC. ONE GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO FURTHER EXTEND THESE APPLICATIONS TO COBORDISMS AND CONTACT GEOMETRY. TO DO SO, THE INVESTIGATOR AIMS TO ESTABLISH NATURALITY RESULTS THAT WILL REFINE ISOMORPHISM CLASS INVARIANTS TO CONCRETE HOMOLOGY GROUP ELEMENTS. THE COMBINATORIAL DIAGRAMS INVOLVED WILL ALSO SHED LIGHT ON THE SIGNIFICANT YET MYSTERIOUS LINK BETWEEN FLOER THEORY AND REPRESENTATION-THEORETIC INVARIANTS, WHICH HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE FORM OF SPECTRAL SEQUENCES.

DURING REHABILITATION SESSIONS, THERAPISTS CAREFULLY MONITOR MOTIONS AND GIVE FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE MOTOR FUNCTION AND CONTROL. BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE THIS MONITORING AND FEEDBACK OUTSIDE OF REHABILITATION SESSIONS COULD BE A VALUABLE ADDITION TO THERAPY; HOWEVER, EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES FOR CONTINUOUS BODY POSE AND MOTION ESTIMATION HAVE MANY LIMITATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL?S GOAL IS TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNIQUES FOR POSE AND MOTION ESTIMATION BASED ON CAPACITIVE SENSOR ARRAYS (CSAS), A COMMON TECHNOLOGY USED IN DEVICES SUCH AS SMARTPHONES. THESE NEW TECHNIQUES WILL EXAMINE HOW BOTH SENSORS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND FLEXIBLE, BODY-WORN SENSORS CAN BE USED TO BETTER ESTIMATE POSE AND MOTION. THE WORK WILL INCLUDE DEVELOPING NEW WAYS TO CONFIGURE AND DEPLOY CSAS, PROCESS THE SIGNALS THEY SEND BACK, AND COMBINE MULTIPLE TYPES OF SENSORS. THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON UPPER BODY POSE AND MOTION DETECTION, PARTICULARLY PEOPLE?S ARMS, BUT THE INSIGHTS AND METHODS ARE LIKELY TO APPLY TO A WIDE RANGE OF MEDICAL APPLICATIONS AND MORE GENERALLY PROVIDE NEW WAYS TO INTERACT WITH COMPUTERS. IN PARTICULAR, THE OUTCOMES OF THE WORK MAY BOTH HELP THERAPISTS DEVELOP NEW TRAINING PROCEDURES AND SUPPORT REMOTE PHYSICAL THERAPY THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN NON-URBAN AREAS. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF EMBEDDED AND WEARABLE CSAS AND E-FIELD SENSORS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE, CONTINUOUS POSE ESTIMATION BEYOND THE STATE OF THE ART. TO DO THIS, THE TEAM WILL ADDRESS EXISTING OPEN CHALLENGES OF NON-TOUCH WEARABLE CSAS; NAMELY 1) IMPROVING SENSOR RESOLUTION, 2) REDUCING ERROR DUE TO VARIABLE POSITIONING, AND 3) COMPENSATING FOR ELECTRODE SHIFT. SPECIFICALLY, SENSOR RESOLUTION IN WEARABLE SYSTEMS WILL BE IMPROVED BY CREATING TAILORED CAPACITIVE ARRAYS FOR POSE ESTIMATION, AUGMENTING THE RESOLUTION OF THE SENSORS AND IMPROVING NOISE FILTERING THROUGH DEEP TRANSFER LEARNING, AND COMPENSATING FOR ERRORS BY AUGMENTING THE DATA WITH ADDITIONAL SENSING MECHANISMS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE EVALUATED THROUGH TASK-BASED REMOTE NEUROREHABILITATION TRAINING FOR PEOPLE WITH UPPER LIMB IMPAIRMENTS, WHICH IS CURRENTLY LACKING SUPPORT FOR LONG-TERM AND IN-THE-WILD MOTOR ASSESSMENT.

AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) CONTINUES TO PROGRESS, IT WILL BE USED TO FORM TEAMS WITH HUMAN COLLABORATORS. EFFECTIVE TEAMWORK REQUIRES SHARING KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SO TEAMMATES SHARE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO ACCOMPLISH GOALS. CURRENTLY, AI AGENTS PRIORITIZE SIMPLE TASK COMPLETION AND HAVE LITTLE TO NO CONCEPTUALIZATION OF WHAT TEAMWORK AND TEAM COGNITION IS OR WHAT BEING A GOOD TEAMMATE ENTAILS. TO ENSURE THAT HUMANS AND AI ARE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER SAFELY, RESEARCH THAT SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HUMANS WANT AND NEED FROM AN AI TEAMMATE IS NEEDED. FURTHERMORE, WORK IS NEEDED TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP AI TEAMMATES THAT INTENTIONALLY AND POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO HUMAN-AI TEAM COGNITION. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE EXPLORATION OF HOW AI CAN BE DESIGNED, CREATED, AND IMPLEMENTED INTO HUMAN-AI TEAMS TO ADVANCE TEAM COGNITION. THE PROJECT WILL RESULT IN AI SYSTEMS THAT ENABLE EFFECTIVE TEAMING WITH PEOPLE. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED ABOUT EFFECTIVE HUMAN-AI TEAMING THROUGH ADVANCING TEAM COGNITION WILL IMPROVE HUMAN ACCEPTANCE OF AI TEAMMATES AND INCREASE HUMAN ENTHUSIASM FOR WORKING WITH AI. THE TECHNICAL GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE RELATED AIMS. FIRST, INTERVIEWS WITH REAL-WORLD WORKERS, FOLLOWED BY A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY EXPERIMENT, ARE USED TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT HUMANS WANT AI TO CONTRIBUTE TO AND BENEFIT TEAM COGNITION. SECOND, PARTICIPATORY DESIGN IS USED TO ENSURE THAT AI TEAMMATES ACTIVELY PROMOTE TEAM COGNITION. DURING HUMAN-AI TEAM. THESE DESIGNS ARE THEN TESTED, VALIDATED, AND REFINED IN A MIXED METHODS EXPERIMENT (COLLECTING AND ANALYZING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA). FINALLY, AN ADDITIONAL MIXED METHODS EXPERIMENT LINKS AI TEAMMATE DESIGN, HUMAN-AI TEAM COGNITION FORMATION, AND HUMAN ACCEPTANCE OF AI TEAMMATES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HUMANS' ACCEPTANCE OF AI TEAMMATES. THIS WORK IS THEN EXTENDED AND APPLIED THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY INSTITUTIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE CONTINUALLY INTEGRATED INTO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO PROMOTE HUMAN-CENTERED PERSPECTIVES IN NEXT-GENERATION AI PRACTITIONERS AND RESEARCHERS. THE THREE AIMS TACKLED BY THIS RESEARCH CREATE A HUMAN-CENTERED FOUNDATION FOR CREATING TEAM COGNITION IN HUMAN-AI TEAMS, AND FOR DESIGNING TEAMMATES THAT MORE EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO TEAMING PROCESSES AND OUTCOMES. THIS FOUNDATION INCLUDES THE IDENTIFICATION OF HOW HUMANS WANT AI TEAMMATES TO BENEFIT TEAM COGNITION, THE ACTIONS AI TEAMMATES CAN TAKE TO CREATE SAID BENEFIT, AND HOW THAT REALIZED BENEFIT CREATES HIGH-PERFORMANCE HUMAN-AI TEAMS AND HIGHLY ACCEPTED AI TEAMMATES.

PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS AND DEVICES AT BIOLOGICAL INTERFACES (I.E., BIOELECTRONICS) ENABLES IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS IN HUMAN HEALTH, SUCH AS FOR ELECTROSTIMULATION (E.G., TO TREAT PARKINSON?S OR ALZHEIMER?S DISEASE), BIOSENSING, NERVE/WOUND HEALING, AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS. BUT, MOST COMMON ELECTRONICS IN EVERYDAY DEVICES ARE MADE OF PRECIOUS METAL CONDUCTORS, SUCH AS GOLD OR PLATINUM. THESE MATERIALS ARE NOT IDEAL FOR APPLICATIONS RELATED TO HUMAN HEALTH BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO RIGID AND BRITTLE. THEY ALSO USE ELECTRONS FOR COMMUNICATION INSTEAD OF IONS LIKE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS DO (E.G., NEURONS COMMUNICATE THROUGH DIFFERENCES IN ION CONCENTRATION); THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ?TRANSLATE? ELECTRONIC SIGNALS TO IONIC ONES FOR STIMULATION, OR VICE VERSA FOR SENSING. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, NEW MATERIALS ARE NEEDED THAT ARE MUCH SOFTER, BIOCOMPATIBLE, AND ENABLE THE CONDUCTION OF BOTH ELECTRONS AND IONS. THIS RESEARCH WILL INTRODUCE A NEW CLASS OF POLYMERS THAT FIT THESE CRITERIA AND HAVE PROPERTIES INSPIRED FROM BIOLOGY. THESE ELECTRON- AND ION-CONDUCTING POLYMERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED, CHARACTERIZED AND INTEGRATED IN DEVICES, TO PROVIDE DESIGN RULES TO OPTIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR BIOELECTRONICS APPLICATIONS. THIS RESEARCH WILL THEREFORE HAVE AN IMPACT IN BOTH FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ON MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS IN HEALTHCARE. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES, HANDS-ON DEMONSTRATIONS, AND A MENTORING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO BROADLY EDUCATE ABOUT THE USES OF POLYMERIC MATERIALS AND TRIGGER AND NURTURE INTEREST IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. THESE EDUCATIONAL, OUTREACH, AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES WILL ACTIVELY ENGAGE GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO HELP DEVELOP THEIR CAPABILITIES AS INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCHERS, AND THEREBY ALSO INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION AND RETENTION OF MARGINALIZED STUDENTS. PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY ELECTRICALLY-CONDUCTIVE POLYMERS THAT CAN ALSO TRANSPORT IONS (I.E., ORGANIC MIXED IONIC-ELECTRONIC CONDUCTORS) COULD PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THE STUDY AND TREATMENT OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS BY ACTING AS TRANSDUCERS BETWEEN IONIC AND ELECTRONIC SIGNALS. HOWEVER, CURRENT METHODS TO FUNCTIONALIZE THESE MATERIALS FOR BIOELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO BLENDING WITH ADDITIVES AND TO SIDE-CHAIN MODIFICATION, WHICH OFTEN DECREASE THE ELECTRONIC PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVICES. THE GOAL OF THE PLANNED RESEARCH IS THEREFORE TO ACCESS ORGANIC MIXED IONIC-ELECTRONIC CONDUCTORS THAT MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE THEIR ELECTRONIC PERFORMANCE UPON FUNCTIONALIZATION WITH AN ELECTRONICALLY-INSULATING POLYMER. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE COMPLEXATION BETWEEN NEUTRAL-ANIONIC DIBLOCK COPOLYMERS AND POSITIVELY-CHARGED CONDUCTIVE POLYMERS (I.E., BLOCK POLYELECTROLYTE COMPLEXES) WILL BE LEVERAGED TO CONTROL THE ORDERING OF OTHERWISE DISORDERED MIXED CONDUCTORS, AND ULTIMATELY TAILOR THEIR PROPERTIES FOR APPLICATIONS SPECIFIC TO BIOELECTRONICS. THESE BLOCK POLYELECTROLYTE COMPLEXES WILL MIMIC KEY PROPERTIES OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS WHILE PRECISELY CONTROLLING THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF IONIC AND ELECTRONIC TRANSPORT AND IONIC-ELECTRONIC COUPLING. THE RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON MIMICKING THREE BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES: (1) SPECIFICITY, (2) DYNAMIC AND ADAPTABLE PROPERTIES, AND (3) BIODEGRADABILITY. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL ENABLE NEW FUNCTIONALITIES FOR BIOELECTRONIC DEVICES (E.G., ION-SELECTIVE SENSORS, INJECTABLE AND CONDUCTIVE TISSUE SCAFFOLDS, AND TRANSIENT DEVICES), AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL MOLECULAR DESIGN RULES FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE ORGANIC MIXED IONIC-ELECTRONIC CONDUCTORS. THIS RESEARCH WILL ALSO INTEGRATE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS ABOUT THE POSITIVE SOCIETAL IMPACT OF FUNCTIONAL PLASTICS, IN PARTICULAR PLASTIC ELECTRONICS. A LABORATORY MODULE WILL BE DEVELOPED TO INTRODUCE JUNIOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO AUTHENTIC RESEARCH IN ORGANIC ELECTRONICS. THE SAMPLES PRODUCED DURING THIS LABORATORY WILL BE USED IN AN OUTREACH MODULE ON PLASTIC ELECTRONICS FOR K-12 STUDENTS.

HEA NPS ARE STRUCTURES WHERE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (TYPICALLY FIVE OR MORE) ARE HOMOGENEOUSLY MIXED AT NANOSCALE DIMENSIONS. THIS TECHNIQUE OF FABRICATING NPS OFFERS ACCESS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPOSITIONS OF HEAS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO FORM UNIQUE MICROSTRUCTURES, LEADING TO NEW PHYSICAL PROPERTIES WHICH CAN BE APPLIED IN AREAS LIKE CATALYSIS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES. A KEY CHALLENGE TO REALIZING THE UNIQUE POTENTIAL OF HEA NPS IS THE LACK OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES THAT CAN ACCESS A LARGE COMPOSITIONAL AND DIMENSIONAL SPACE OF NPS AND ADVANCE THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF PROCESS-STRUCTURE-PROPERTY CORRELATIONS. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL AIM TO DEVELOP A LASER-DRIVEN METHOD THAT RELIABLY ALLOWS THE GENERATION OF HEA NPS WITH CONTROL OVER BROAD COMPOSITION AND SIZE RANGES. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO GENERATE EXTENSIVE MATERIAL LIBRARIES OF HEA NPS, WHICH CAN ACCELERATE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THE ACROSS-THE-SCALE (ATOMIC-TO-NANO) STRUCTURE OF NPS AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH THE ELECTRO- AND PLASMONIC CATALYTIC PROPERTIES.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A HIGH-THROUGHPUT METHODOLOGY TO CREATE HEA NPS WITH LARGE COMPOSITIONAL AND DIMENSIONAL SPACE BY EMPLOYING A NANOSECOND PULSED LASER-DRIVEN PARTICLE FORMATION METHOD. THE PULSED LASER PROCESSING ON COMBINATORIAL MULTILAYER/ALLOY ULTRATHIN FILMS (1-30 NM) FACILITATES THE FABRICATION OF WELL-DEFINED ISOLATED DROPLET-SHAPED HEA NPS OF VARIOUS COMPOSITIONS ON SUBSTRATES. THESE NPS ARE FORMED THROUGH THE LASER-INDUCED MELT-PHASE DEWETTING PHENOMENON, COUPLED WITH THERMALLY-DRIVEN MASS TRANSPORT AND ULTRAFAST SOLIDIFICATION IN THE NANOSECOND TIMESCALE. THE SUCCESS OF THIS HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN METHODOLOGY WILL FACILITATE AN ACCELERATED FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORMATION MECHANISM, GOVERNING FACTORS, ELEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION, AND MICROSTRUCTURES. THE UTILIZATION OF CONVENTIONAL AND ADVANCED DATA SCIENCE DRIVEN CHARACTERIZATION METHODS, SUCH AS 4D SCANNING TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, WILL RESOLVE THE COMPOSITIONAL AND MICROSTRUCTURAL COMPLEXITIES TO FILL THE KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING LASER-MATERIAL INTERACTIONS FOR CREATING NPS. THESE RESULTS WILL HAVE BROADER IMPLICATIONS FOR ADVANCING THE FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE OF MICROSTRUCTURE CORRELATIONS WITH THE ELECTRO- AND PLASMONIC CATALYTIC PROPERTIES OF HEA NPS.

THIS TRADEOFF HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN EVERYDAY LIFE - DO WE ?EXPLOIT? WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW, OR ?EXPLORE? SOMETHING NEW AND UNFAMILIAR? DO WE CHOOSE TO GO TO OUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT (EXPLOITATION) OR TRY OUT A NEW RESTAURANT (EXPLORATION)? OTHER EXAMPLES INCLUDE DECIDING WHERE TO GO FOR VACATION, WHICH FRIENDS TO TALK TO AT A PARTY, OR WHAT FOODS TO ORDER AT THE RESTAURANT. WHILE EXPLORING NEW PLACES, NEW FRIENDS, NEW FOODS IS KEY TO FIGURING OUT WHAT WE LIKE AND CAN LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF NEW PREFERENCES, IT COMES AT THE COST OF FOREGOING THE IMMEDIATE VALUE OF FAMILIAR OPTIONS. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE DECISION TO EXPLORE OR EXPLOIT TAKES SHAPE IN THE HUMAN BRAIN. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE NEURAL BASIS OF DECISION MAKING, TWO NON-INVASIVE, COMPLEMENTARY NEUROIMAGING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO ANALYZE BRAIN ACTIVITY WHILE PEOPLE MAKE THE DECISION TO EXPLORE OR EXPLOIT. ONE APPROACH (FMRI OR FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING) HAS SUPERB SPATIAL RESOLUTION, AND CAN TELL WHERE BRAIN ACTIVITY IS LOCALIZED DURING DECISION-MAKING. ANOTHER APPROACH (MEG OR MAGNOENCEPHALOGRAPHY) HAS EXCELLENT TEMPORAL RESOLUTION AND CAN PINPOINT PRECISELY WHEN BRAIN SIGNALS OCCUR WHILE PEOPLE MAKE EXPLORE-EXPLOIT DECISIONS. RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TIMING OF THESE DECISIONS IN THE BRAIN. UTILIZING THESE NEUROIMAGING TECHNIQUES, EXPERIMENTS MEASURE THE SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY IN SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GAIN AS MANY PROFITS AS POSSIBLE, AS WELL AS IN CONTRASTING SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO AVOID LOSSES. THIS WILL ALLOW AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST OF THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE BRAIN CIRCUITS INVOLVED WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS THROUGH EXPLORE-EXPLOIT DECISIONS ARE DISTINCT FROM THE CIRCUITS INVOLVED WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE LOSSES. USING COMPUTATIONAL MODELING, THE PROJECT WILL ALSO STUDY THE ACCURACY OF DECODING EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION DECISIONS FROM MEG BRAIN DATA UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN A DECISION TRIAL. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH WILL USE A TECHNIQUE (TMS OR TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION) FOR SAFELY STIMULATING THE BRAIN TO PROVIDE A ?CAUSE-AND-EFFECT? TEST OF PREDICTIONS ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN CONTROLS EXPLORE-EXPLOIT DECISIONS. HOW THE HUMAN BRAIN CHOOSES BETWEEN FAMILIARITY AND NOVELTY DURING DECISION-MAKING IS A LONG-STANDING MYSTERY IN HUMAN BRAIN AND DECISION SCIENCES, AND THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS LIKELY TO GREATLY INCREASE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEURAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DECISION MAKING.

FUSION-BASED METAL ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING EMPLOYS A HIGH-ENERGY HEAT SOURCE TO FABRICATE THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) METAL AND METAL-BASED PARTS THROUGH A LAYER-BY-LAYER PROCESS. DESPITE THE HIGH DENSITY, ADDITIVE PARTS HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN MECHANICAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS ANISOTROPY AND LOW DUCTILITY, WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY HINDER THEIR USE IN CRITICAL STRUCTURAL APPLICATIONS. TO ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS, THIS PROJECT WILL PERFORM FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH TO ENABLE A TRANSFORMATIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESS?HI-RAM. THIS NEW PROCESS INCORPORATES AN IN-SITU THERMOMECHANICAL HOT ROLLING PROCESS IN THE ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, IN WHICH A MICRO-ROLLER TRAILS THE HEAT SOURCE AND ROLLS THE DEPOSITED METAL BEAD. THE HIGH-PERFORMANCE STRUCTURAL PARTS FABRICATED BY HI-RAM COULD INCREASE THE ADOPTION OF 3D PRINTED METAL PARTS BY MANY INDUSTRIES, AND THUS HI-RAM COULD SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE U.S. MANUFACTURING LEADERSHIP.

MEANWHILE, SOLID-STATE BATTERIES, WHICH EMPLOY NONFLAMMABLE SOLID ELECTROLYTES TO REPLACE THE FLAMMABLE LIQUID ONES, OFFER A REVOLUTIONARY SOLUTION TO MITIGATE FIRE HAZARDS THAT HAVE HOBBLED THE ADVANCES OF BATTERY TECHNOLOGY. ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID-STATE SODIUM BATTERIES LIES IN THE LARGE INTERFACIAL RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE SODIUM CERAMIC SOLID ELECTROLYTE AND THE ELECTRODE MATERIAL. THIS CAREER AWARD PROJECT, JOINTLY SUPPORTED BY THE CERAMICS PROGRAM IN THE DIVISION OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, AND THE THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR), ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL INTERFACIAL CHALLENGES FACING BETWEEN A SODIUM METAL ELECTRODE AND THE SODIUM CERAMIC SOLID ELECTROLYTE THROUGH REGULATING THE ELECTROLYTE SURFACE PROPERTIES.

HOWEVER, THE PAIRING OF NASICON ELECTROLYTE WITH METALLIC SODIUM ANODE FOR SOLID-STATE SODIUM BATTERIES GIVES LARGE NASICON/SODIUM INTERFACIAL RESISTANCE AND NONUNIFORM DENDRITIC SODIUM DEPOSITION OVER ELECTROCHEMICAL CYCLING. IN THIS CAREER PROJECT, THE INTERFACE CHEMISTRY OF NASICON WILL BE REGULATED BY A VARIETY OF ULTRATHIN METAL OXIDE COATINGS VIA ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION. THIS RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE COMPOSITION, CRYSTALLINITY, MORPHOLOGY, AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE OXIDE COATING ON NASICON PLAY CRITICAL ROLES IN THE EARLY-STAGE ELECTROCHEMICAL WETTABILITY OF SODIUM METAL AND THE SODIUM-ION TRANSPORT ACROSS THE INTERFACE, WHICH AFFECT THE INTERFACIAL IMPEDANCE, THE SODIUM NUCLEATION/GROWTH PROCESS, AND THE ELECTROCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS. THIS RESEARCH CAN TAKE A LEAP BEYOND THE LITHIUM TECHNOLOGY BY UTILIZING THE MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE, NATURAL ABUNDANT AND LOW-COST SODIUM RESOURCES. THE REDUCED COST OF SODIUM BATTERIES COMPARED TO THE LITHIUM SYSTEMS WILL MAKE THEM HIGHLY DESIRABLE FOR LARGE-SCALE ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATION.

THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ENHANCE FUNCTIONALITY OF A LOW FREQUENCY LOW ACCELERATION PIEZOELECTRIC MICROSYSTEM ENERGY HARVESTER BY COMBINING NOVEL INTEGRATION AND ACTUATION MECHANISMS TO I) WIDEN THE BANDWIDTH, II) PERFORM WIDE RANGE ACTIVE/PASSIVE FREQUENCY TUNING, AND III) ENHANCE POWER DENSITY USING NOVEL FUNCTIONAL THIN FILM MATERIAL STRUCTURES. EACH COMPONENT WILL BE DESIGNED AND CHARACTERIZED INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN INTEGRATED TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A COMPLETE UNIVERSAL SYSTEM THAT CAN OVERCOME THE CURRENT CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH MICRO-SCALE VIBRATION ENERGY HARVESTERS. NON-LINEAR DYNAMICS MECHANISMS TO WIDEN THE BANDWIDTH WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN POWER USING MONOLITHICALLY INTEGRATED MOVABLE PROOF-MASS WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THIS WILL RESULT IN A PASSIVE WIDE BANDWIDTH SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL POWER CONSUMPTION. FREQUENCY TUNING WILL BE INVESTIGATED USING A NOVEL MASS LOAD DISTRIBUTION METHOD THAT CAN BE PASSIVE TO INCREASE MANUFACTURABILITY OF THE DEVICES AND PROMOTE BATCH FABRICATION ADVANTAGES OF MICROSYSTEMS TO OBTAIN A UNIVERSAL LOW-FREQUENCY SYSTEM FOR MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS (<250 HZ). AN ACTIVE TUNING MECHANISM BASED ON MASS LOAD DISTRIBUTION WITH A TARGETED FREQUENCY RANGE OF 200 HZ WITH A RESOLUTION OF <1 HZ WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED.

COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA IS A FIELD OF ABSTRACT ALGEBRA THAT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE SOLUTION SETS OF SYSTEM OF POLYNOMIAL EQUATIONS. IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL AREA OF RESEARCH WITH APPLICATIONS AND CONNECTIONS TO FIELDS SUCH AS ROBOTICS, STATISTICS, AND PHYSICS. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES STUDYING CLASSICAL SYSTEMS OF POLYNOMIAL EQUATIONS IN FAMILIAR SETTINGS SUCH AS THE REAL OR COMPLEX NUMBERS, BUT ALSO THE LESS UNDERSTOOD SETTING OF MIXED CHARACTERISTIC, WHICH HAS CONNECTIONS WITH NUMBER THEORY AND ARITHMETIC GEOMETRY. THIS AWARD WILL ALSO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND GRADUATE STUDENT TRAINING, AS WELL AS THE PROMOTION OF WORK BY EARLY-CAREER RESEARCHERS. THE PI WILL PURSUE RESEARCH PROJECTS IN HOMOLOGICAL AND COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA RELATING TO THE STUDY AND APPLICATIONS OF P-DERIVATIONS IN MIXED CHARACTERISTIC COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA, SYMBOLIC POWERS, AND COHOMOLOGICAL SUPPORT VARIETIES. MANY TECHNIQUES IN COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA AND ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY ONLY WORK FOR AN ALGEBRA OVER A FIELD, BECAUSE OF THE USE OF RESOLUTION OF SINGULARITIES AND VANISHING THEOREMS IN CHARACTERISTIC ZERO AND THE HOMOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE FROBENIUS MAP IN POSITIVE CHARACTERISTIC. IN CONTRAST, THE MIXED CHARACTERISTIC SETTING IS OFTEN MORE DELICATE, AND MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN OPEN ONLY IN THAT SETTING. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT P-DERIVATIONS, A TOOL FROM ARITHMETIC GEOMETRY, CAN BE APPLIED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS ARISING IN MIXED CHARACTERISTIC COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA, ESPECIALLY WHEN APPLIED TOGETHER WITH DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS. THESE PROVIDE NEW AVENUES OF RESEARCH THAT WILL FURTHER THESE APPLICATIONS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO ADDRESS HOMOLOGICAL QUESTIONS MOTIVATED BY RECENT MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS RELATED TO COHOMOLOGICAL SUPPORT VARIETIES AND APPLICATIONS OF THE HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRA OF A RING; AND SYMBOLIC POWERS, AN ALGEBRAIC TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO ANSWER CLASSICAL GEOMETRIC QUESTIONS.

EXISTING APPROACHES TO PROMOTE REQUIREMENTS CREATIVITY, INCLUDING MULTI-DAY WORKSHOPS, TOOLS, AND FRAMEWORKS, ARE TIME-CONSUMING, OFTEN INEFFECTIVE, AND LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE REQUIREMENTS ANALYST'S OWN CREATIVITY. MOREOVER, CREATIVITY HAS A NUMBER OF FACETS THAT SHOULD BE ASSESSED INDEPENDENTLY, BUT THE FIELD OF RE HAS FEW GOOD TOOLS FOR EVALUATING CREATIVITY. THIS PROJECT'S GOAL IS TO USE A RANGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED TECHNIQUES BOTH TO HELP ASSESS REQUIREMENT CREATIVITY AND TO HELP SOFTWARE ENGINEERS DEVELOP MORE CREATIVE REQUIREMENTS. THIS WILL INVOLVE BOTH DEVELOPING INTERFACES THAT HELP ENGINEERS CONSIDER A WIDER RANGE OF POSSIBLE REQUIREMENTS AND A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING CREATIVITY IN RE. THE RESEARCH WORK WILL ALSO SUPPORT CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, MENTORING OF STUDENT RESEARCHERS, AND CREATIVITY-FOCUSED TRAINING WORKSHOPS FOR K-12 STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND SOFTWARE STARTUPS. THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT WILL ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE IN CREATIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPACT LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL ECONOMIES BY HELPING DEVELOPERS BECOME CREATIVE SOFTWARE PROFESSIONALS AND INCREASING THE CHANCE THAT PRODUCTS AND COMPANIES SUCCEED. THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON TWO MAIN OBJECTIVES. THE FIRST MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO USE DATA MINING, MACHINE LEARNING, AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO GENERATE POTENTIALLY CREATIVE IDEAS BASED ON EXISTING ONLINE SOFTWARE-RELATED CONTENT SUCH AS REVIEWS, PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS, ISSUE TRACKING SYSTEMS, AND FORUM DISCUSSIONS. THESE TECHNIQUES WILL THEN BE INTEGRATED INTO A SUPPORT SYSTEM TO EXPLORE AND SELECT CREATIVE REQUIREMENTS WITH GUIDED HUMAN INTERVENTION.

EVENTUALLY THESE SKELETONS ARE CEMENTED TOGETHER TO FORM CORAL REEFS. CORAL REEFS ARE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE THREATENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. LAB EXPERIMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE CORAL SKELETON-BUILDING PROCESS IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY OCEAN WARMING AND ACIDIFICATION. OCEAN WARMING AND ACIDIFICATION ARE CAUSED BY CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE BY HUMANS SINCE THE MID-19TH CENTURY. LAB EXPERIMENTS OFTEN TEST THESE IMPACTS OVER WEEKS TO MONTHS, BUT CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS WILD CORALS IN THE OCEAN OVER DECADES TO CENTURIES. ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS TO STUDY HOW WILD CORALS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THESE CHANGES IS TO MEASURE PAST GROWTH RATES IN THEIR SKELETONS. CORALS DEVELOP ANNUAL BANDS MUCH LIKE TREE RINGS CREATING A RECORD OF THEIR GROWTH OVER TIME. THIS AWARD WILL SUPPORT A COMBINED RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOCUSED ON STUDENT TRAINING, IMPROVING CORAL DATA ACCESS, AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROGRAM WILL IMPROVE METHODS FOR CORAL SKELETAL ANALYSIS AND BUILD A VIRTUAL CORAL CORE REPOSITORY. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO CREATE AN INTERACTIVE APP IN WHICH STUDENTS OR THE PUBLIC CAN INTERACT WITH CORAL DATA AND CONTRIBUTE TO CROWDSOURCED DATA ANALYSIS. RESEARCH CONDUCTED UNDER THIS CAREER AWARD WILL ADDRESS THE DRIVERS OF LONG-TERM CHANGES IN CORAL CALCIFICATION RATES DURING THE INDUSTRIAL ERA. THE FIRST STAGES OF THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING NEW TOOLS FOR GROWTH-RATE ANALYSIS FROM CORAL CORES AND BUILDING THE VIRTUAL CORE REPOSITORY TO MAKE ALL EXISTING CORAL CORE CT SCANS PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE. THIS WILL ENABLE A BIG-DATA APPROACH IN WHICH SEVERAL HUNDRED CORES FROM ACROSS THE TROPICS CAN BE PROCESSED FOR PAST GROWTH RATES WITH OPTIMAL ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL METHODS, PROVIDING THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE TEST OF WHETHER CORAL GROWTH RATES IN THE WILD HAVE CHANGED UNDER THE PAST CENTURY OR MORE OF OCEAN WARMING AND ACIDIFICATION. THE MEASUREMENT OF GROWTH RATES IN THESE CORES WILL BE TRANSPARENT, WITH THE TRACEABLE ANALYSIS FILES SAVED IN THE VIRTUAL REPOSITORY ALONGSIDE EACH CORE, ENABLING MULTI-OBSERVER ANALYSIS BY RESEARCHERS ACROSS THE GLOBE. SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS OF INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY OF CORAL GROWTH, OR RECONSTRUCTION OF PAST CLIMATE VARIABILITY FROM GROWTH RATES, WILL BE ENABLED BY THE VIRTUAL REPOSITORY, INCLUDING CONTINUED ADDITION OF NEW CORES COLLECTED DURING THIS PROJECT.

THESE TECHNOLOGIES ALL USE CAREFULLY PREPARED LIGHT WAVES TO EFFECTIVELY MEASURE OR COMMUNICATE WITH THE WORLD AROUND US. AN IMPORTANT PART OF DEVELOPING THESE TECHNOLOGIES IS DEVELOPING COMPACT AND EFFICIENT COMPONENTS WHICH CONTROL BOTH DIRECTION AND ORIENTATION OF THE LIGHT. THE CAPABILITIES OF EACH COMPONENT ARE CRITICALLY DETERMINED BY THE MATERIALS USED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION, AND HOW LIGHT INTERACTS WITH THESE MATERIALS. NOTABLY, BY USING UNCONVENTIONAL MATERIALS, SCIENTISTS CAN GENERATE NEW TYPES OF LIGHT PROPAGATION, AND MAKE OPTICAL COMPONENTS BOTH SMALLER AND MORE EFFICIENT. IN THIS PROJECT, THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL DETERMINE HOW CERTAIN CLASSES OF CRYSTALS CAN BE USED TO CONTROL BOTH DIRECTION AND ORIENTATION OF LIGHT WAVES. BY COUPLING LIGHT TO A CLASS OF CRYSTALS HAVING A PARALLELEPIPED STRUCTURE, IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO ENGINEER A UNIQUE LIGHT-MATTER INTERACTIONS NOT SEEN IN MATERIALS WITH SIMPLER STRUCTURES. BY PERFORMING THESE STUDIES, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR AND TEAM WILL DISCOVER NEW DESIGN PARADIGMS FOR CREATING OPTICAL COMPONENTS EXPLOITING THIS CLASS OF CRYSTALS. A KEY PART OF THIS IS DEVELOPING EDUCATIONAL TOOLS WHICH CAN BE USED TO EDUCATE THE FUTURE PHOTONICS WORKFORCE ON HOW THESE MATERIALS WORK AND CAN BE UTILIZED. WE WILL SPECIFICALLY WORK WITH TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS ? MIDDLE SCHOOL AND JUNIOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, WHICH TYPICALLY RECEIVE LIMITED EDUCATION ON PHOTONICS AND THE IMPACT ON MODERN TECHNOLOGIES. IN THE FORMER CASE, WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH MIDDLE-SCHOOL TEACHERS TO DEVELOP A SERIES OF LESSON PLANS TO TARGET CURRICULUM RELEVANT SKILLS, INCLUDING CONCEPTS IN PHOTONICS. OUR WORK WITH JUNIOR UNDERGRADUATES WILL THEN BUILD ON THIS, INTRODUCING RESEARCH-LIKE PROJECTS INTO THE CURRICULUM TO BUILD KEY ANALYSIS SKILLS REQUIRED FOR THE FUTURE QUANTUM AND SEMICONDUCTOR WORKFORCES. THOSE EFFORTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED ONLINE, WHICH WILL ALLOW TEACHERS NATIONALLY TO ACCESS RESOURCES DEVELOPED AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM. PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY THE RESEARCH FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING HOW LIGHT CAN PROPAGATE IN CRYSTALS WITH LOW CRYSTALLINE SYMMETRY. COUPLING LIGHT TO MATERIALS WITH INHERENTLY LOW SYMMETRY PRODUCES SHEAR POLARITONS, A PHENOMENON THAT CAN ENHANCE A SPECIFIC RANGE AND ORIENTATION OF WAVE VECTORS; THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE IN MORE CONVENTIONAL MATERIALS. SIMILARLY, SHEAR POLARITONS CAN OFFER CONTROL OVER THE POLARIZATION STATE, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL TO REALIZE PHOTONS WITH HIGH ANGULAR ORBITAL MOMENTUM. THIS WAVE VECTOR SELECTIVITY OFFERS INSENSITIVITY TO SCATTERING, WHICH WOULD ENABLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-EFFICIENCY DEVICES. HOWEVER, THERE IS A CLEAR AND CRITICAL NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MATERIALS IN WHICH THESE FORM, TO LEVERAGE THEIR UNIQUE CHIRAL PROPERTIES FOR PHOTONICS WITH CONTROL OVER DIRECTIONALITY AND POLARIZATION. THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR IDENTIFYING MATERIALS THAT PRODUCE STRONG SHEAR PHENOMENA, AS WELL AS DETERMINING HOW THEY CAN BE APPLIED IN DEVELOPING FUTURE PHOTONIC TECHNOLOGIES. THE UTILIZATION OF NATURAL CRYSTAL SYSTEMS REDUCES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEX NANOSTRUCTURE DESIGNS, REDUCING THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW PHENOMENA. THE TEAM ENVISION THE CREATION OF LIGHT SOURCES THROUGH LONG-WAVE INFRARED RANGE THAT EMIT WITH HIGH DIRECTIONALITY LINEAR, CIRCULAR, OR VORTEX POLARIZED BEAMS, IN THE ABSENCE OF EXTERNAL OPTICS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED OVER THREE OBJECTIVES. (I) CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING POLARITON PROPAGATION AND SCATTERING IN THE LOWEST SYMMETRY CRYSTALS, (II) DEMONSTRATE POLARITONIC EMISSION IN LOW SYMMETRY EXCITONIC MATERIALS FOR ASYMMETRIC PHOTOEMISSION, (III) ENHANCE PHOTONIC MATERIALS EDUCATION TOWARD THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING A FUTURE QUANTUM WORKFORCE.

THE SAL HAS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC ATTENTION DUE TO THE ROLE THAT IT PLAYS IN AIR QUALITY AND INHIBITING TROPICAL CYCLONE FORMATION. RECENT WORK HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT THE SAL CAN IMPACT DROUGHT IN THE CARIBBEAN. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE FACTORS THAT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DROUGHT IN THE CARIBBEAN, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON PUERTO RICO.

FURTHERMORE, FAILURES OF THIS SEARCH PROCESS, WHICH SHOW UP AS WORD-FINDING DIFFICULTIES OR HAVING WORDS ON THE TIP OF YOUR TONGUE, CAN BE SYMPTOMATIC OF CERTAIN CLINICAL DISORDERS, AND A STRONGER THEORY OF HOW THIS KIND OF MEMORY SEARCH WORKS CAN INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY IT SOMETIMES FAILS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH LEVERAGES RECENT ADVANCES IN MACHINE LEARNING, NETWORK SCIENCE, AND GAMIFICATION. WORD SEARCH IS CONCEPTUALIZED WITHIN A MEMORY SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES BOTH INFORMATION ABOUT A WORD'S MEANING (E.G. THAT A DOG IS A TYPE OF ANIMAL) AND INFORMATION ABOUT A WORD'S SOUNDS (E.G., THAT DOG AND DOT START WITH THE SAME SOUNDS). THIS RESEARCH INFORMS THE USE AND INTERPRETATION OF CLINICAL MEASURES OF MEMORY SEARCH AS WELL AS PROMOTE PARTICIPATION FROM UNDERREPRESENTED IDENTITIES IN STEM GENERALLY AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE SPECIFICALLY. THIS COLLABORATIVE PROPOSAL BRINGS TOGETHER RESEARCHERS IN PSYCHOLINGUISTICS, NETWORK SCIENCE, AND LANGUAGE MODELING TO DEVELOP A UNIFIED COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK TO STUDY LEXICAL SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL USING A TASK THAT IS WIDELY USED IN BOTH BASIC SCIENCE AND CLINICAL SETTINGS: THE FLUENCY TASK. IN THIS TASK, PARTICIPANTS ARE ASKED TO NAME AS MANY WORDS AS THEY CAN IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME THAT ALL FIT WITH A CATEGORY (E.G. TYPES OF ANIMALS). THE PROPOSED WORK TESTS THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT MEMORY SEARCH UNFOLDS VIA COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL VARIATION BASED ON OUR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES IN THE WORLD. OUR APPROACH INVOLVES DESIGNING A GAMIFIED, WEB-BASED FLUENCY EXPERIMENT TO GENERATE A LARGE BEHAVIORAL DATASET OF VERBAL FLUENCY AND USING NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES BASED ON TWO FUNDAMENTAL SEARCH MECHANISMS (OPTIMAL FORAGING AND RANDOM WALKS) TO ACCOUNT FOR WHICH WORDS ARE PRODUCED IN WHAT ORDER. WITH THIS APPROACH, WE WILL EVALUATE THE INTERACTION OF MEANING AND SOUND INFORMATION, AND ACCOUNT FOR THE VARIANCE OBSERVED IN HOW DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS PERFORM ON THESE TASKS. THE PROPOSED GAMIFIED WEB-BASED FLUENCY TASK, COMBINED WITH THEORY-DRIVEN, BOTTOM-UP COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND MEMORY SEARCH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF FLUENCY DATA, UNCOVER NOVEL INSIGHTS ABOUT MEMORY SEARCH, AND OPEN UP NEW LINES OF INQUIRY THAT CUT ACROSS FIELDS OF PSYCHOLOGY AND LINGUISTICS, THEREBY LEADING TO A MORE ROBUST AND UNIFIED COGNITIVE THEORY OF MEMORY SEARCH.

CHILDREN?S SUCCESS IN SCHOOL AND IN LIFE DEPENDS ON WHETHER THEY HAVE LEARNED CERTAIN SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS IN THEIR EARLY YEARS. TO BUILD TEACHERS? CAPACITY TO PROMOTE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING, THERE IS A NEED FOR TOOLS THAT PROVIDE DATA-BASED FEEDBACK TO TEACHERS ON TALK THAT FOCUSES ON SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING. THIS PROJECT CREATES SUCH A TOOL, THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT (SEAL). SEAL USES ADVANCED SPEECH PROCESSING ALGORITHMS TO AUTOMATICALLY CAPTURE A KEY ELEMENT OF TEACHER PRACTICE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CLASSROOMS KNOWN TO SUPPORT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING: THEIR USE OF LANGUAGE, AND SPECIFICALLY, WORDS AND PHRASES WITHIN EVERYDAY INTERACTIONS THAT TAP INTO SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING. THIS AUTOMATIC MEASUREMENT OF TEACHERS? SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL TALK FROM AUDIO RECORDINGS IN TODDLER CLASSROOMS COULD REPRESENT A TRANSFORMATIVE APPROACH TO HELP TEACHERS BETTER SUPPORT CHILDREN?S SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT (E.G., UNDERSTANDING, MANAGING, AND EXPRESSING EMOTIONS). IN TURN, SUCH A TOOL COULD BETTER ENSURE YOUNG CHILDREN GAIN THE SKILLS THAT ENSURE THEY ARE READY FOR SCHOOL, RELATIONSHIPS, AND LIFE.

MENTORING INTERVENTIONS FOR EXPELLED STUDENTS MAY REPRESENT A KEY, UNTAPPED POTENTIAL LEVER OF CHANGE FOR PREVENTING AND REDUCING RISK BEHAVIORS, WHILE PROMOTING POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AND DISRUPTING THE SCHOOL-TO-PRISON PIPELINE FROM A MIDSTREAM VANTAGE. HOWEVER, RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRUCTURE OF MENTORSHIP PROGRAMMING FOR THIS POPULATION OF YOUTH. THE RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED ON PARTICIPANTS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA ADOLESCENT MENTORING PROGRAM (USC AMP). DEVELOPED IN 2017, USC AMP IS A UNIVERSITY-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM THAT MATCHES TRAINED UNIVERSITY STUDENT MENTORS WHO ARE PLANNING TO PURSUE A CAREER IN A CRIMINAL JUSTICE, HUMAN SERVICES, OR LAW-RELATED FIELD WITH YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM THEIR TRADITIONAL HIGH SCHOOL AND CURRENTLY ATTEND A DISCIPLINARY ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL. TO EXPLORE WHETHER ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL-BASED MENTORING PROGRAMS PROMOTE POSITIVE YOUTH OUTCOMES, THE RESEARCHERS WILL USE A MIXED METHODS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND DRAW UPON QUANTITATIVE SURVEY DATA AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW DATA COLLECTED FROM MENTOR-MENTEE PAIRS.

ALTHOUGH THIS PROJECT WILL NOT SEEK TO DIRECTLY CREATE DIAGNOSTIC OR DISINFECTION DEVICES, IT WILL PROVIDE NEW MATERIALS TO MANUFACTURERS OF SUCH DEVICES AND SERVE TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL GAP OF AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF THE NECESSARY MATERIALS. THE KNOWLEDGE GENERATED AS PART OF THIS WORK WILL ENABLE THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT LEVERAGE THE POWER OF MICROFLUIDICS TO IMPROVE LIVES AND GENERATE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION. THE PROPOSED APPROACH WILL DIRECTLY LEVERAGE THE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES AND FACILITIES OF MAINE-BASED PAPER MANUFACTURERS, POSITIONING MAINE AND TRADITIONAL PAPER MILL WORKERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BIOTECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION. FINALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL TRAIN STUDENTS IN THE TYPES OF SKILLS SETS NEEDED TO NOT ONLY DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN MAKE LIVES BETTER, BUT ALSO TO BRIDGE THE GAP FROM THE LAB TO THE MARKET, SPARKING INTEREST IN AND COMFORT WITH WORKING AT THE INDUSTRY-ACADEMIA INTERFACE. THIS PROJECT WILL RESULT IN THE BUILDING AND DE-RISKING OF FUNCTIONAL MICROFLUIDIC PROTOTYPES USING INDUSTRIAL-SCALE, US-MANUFACTURED ROLL-TO-ROLL CAST MICROFLUIDIC CHANNEL SYSTEMS. TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL OF THE RESEARCH, THREE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT APPLICATIONS AT DIFFERENT LENGTH SCALES WILL BE TARGETED: MICRODROPLET GENERATION, CELL SORTING, AND WATER DISINFECTION. THE PROTOTYPES WILL BE USED TO FACILITATE INTEGRATION WITH THE WORLDWIDE MICROFLUIDIC INDUSTRY. THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, THE TEAM WILL ELUCIDATE MECHANISTIC DESIGN RULES THAT ENABLE THE FABRICATION OF PROTOTYPE MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES, MAKING IT SIMPLER FOR INDUSTRY LEADERS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS TO QUICKLY TEST DESIGNS COMPATIBLE WITH INDUSTRIAL-SCALE ROLL-TO-ROLL PROCESSES. THE SET OF TOOLS CREATED FOR THE COMMERCIAL MICROFLUIDICS INDUSTRY WILL BRIDGE THE HISTORICALLY WIDE GAP BETWEEN ACADEMIC BENCHTOP MICROFLUIDIC DESIGNS AND PLATFORMS WHICH CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO MASS-MANUFACTURING. IN ADDITION TO CREATING A PATHWAY FOR COST-EFFECTIVE SCALE-UP OF MICROFLUIDIC TECHNOLOGY, THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY TEST PROTOTYPES OF SCALABLE MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES IN ROLL-TO-ROLL COMPATIBLE PROTOTYPING PROCESSES HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO INFORM THE DESIGN OF NEW ADVANCED MATERIALS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND/OR SMALL-SCALE LIQUID TREATMENT MARKETS, INCLUDING NEW AND FAST-GROWING MARKETS SUCH AS WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY AND LOW-COST SENSOR SYSTEMS.

HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF RF TECHNOLOGIES FOR RECOGNITION AND HEALTH ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN GAIT IS THE CONTINUOUS AND SEQUENTIAL NATURE OF HUMAN MOVEMENT, WHICH CAN BE CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODS OF ACTIVITY AND TRANSITIONS BETWEEN ACTIVITIES THAT DEPEND UPON A PERSON?S MOBILITY. GAIT IS A PERSON-SPECIFIC TRAIT THAT EMBODIES IMPORTANT HEALTH INFORMATION FOR MANY DISORDERS AS WELL AS AGING RELATED IMPACTS. THUS, A SECOND IMPORTANT CHALLENGE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALIZED MACHINE LEARNING (ML) MODELS THAT CONTINUALLY LEARN FROM PERSON-SPECIFIC RF DATA TO IMPROVE HEALTH-DRIVEN GAIT ANALYSIS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS THE DESIGN OF A PERSONALIZED RF-SENSING FRAMEWORK FOR THE MONITORING OF ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADL), DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PATHOLOGICAL, GAITS ROUND-THE-CLOCK 24/7 IN A NATURAL SETTING. THE PROPOSAL?S TWO MAIN OBJECTIVES ARE: 1) CREATE A HUMAN ETHOGRAM VIA THE FORMULATION OF A NEW AND GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETATION, SEGMENTATION, AND CATEGORIZATION OF A BROAD SWATH OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES BASED ON MODELING THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF INDIVIDUAL MOBILITY; 2) DESIGN A NEW APPROACH FOR PERSONALIZATION OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS, WHERE CONSECUTIVE AND CONTIGUOUS OBSERVATIONS ARE USED TO INCREASE THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY OF ADL FOR THE MONITORED PERSON. THE ETHOGRAM IS A QUANTITATIVE, STRUCTURED APPROACH TO DESCRIBING DAILY HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN TERMS OF ?BODY STATES? WHILE ACTIVITIES ARE THEN MODELED AS TRANSITIONS BETWEEN STATES. BY INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF PERSONALIZATION TO RF SENSING, THIS PROJECT WILL BROADEN THE REALM OF PERSONALIZED DEVICES BEYOND ITS CURRENT SCOPE OF WEARABLE AND IMPLANTABLE DEVICES TO NOW INCLUDE RF SENSORS. THE PROPOSAL INTEGRATES SENSOR AND KINEMATIC KNOWLEDGE INTO DNN DESIGN, RESULTING IN NOVEL ARCHITECTURES WITH GREATER ACCURACY THAT WILL ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN RF SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION MORE GENERALLY. MOREOVER, THE CENTRAL IDEAS IN THIS PROPOSAL ARE INDEPENDENT OF DEVICE SPECIFICATIONS AND CAN BE GENERALIZED TO OTHER SENSING MODALITIES, PAVING THE WAY FOR NON-CONTACT, UBIQUITOUS, FINE-GRAINED PERSONALIZED GAIT CLASSIFICATION AND ANALYSIS.

UNLIKE RESIDENT SPECIES, MIGRATORY BIRDS ARE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AS THEY MUST MOVE THROUGH MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTS EACH YEAR. THEY MUST TIME MIGRATORY JOURNEYS WITHOUT DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AT THEIR DESTINATION, RELYING ON GENERALIZED SEASONAL CUES, SPECIFICALLY THE SEASONAL CHANGE IN DAY LENGTH, PHOTOPERIOD, TO APPROPRIATELY TIME DEPARTURE. HOWEVER, WE STILL KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN THAT PROCESS PHOTOPERIOD INFORMATION INTO THE COMPLEX CHANGES IN PHYSIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR NECESSARY TO SUPPORT MIGRATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE SHARED RELIANCE OF BOTH MIGRATION AND PREPARATION FOR REPRODUCTION ON THE SAME SEASONAL PHOTOPERIOD CUES HAS LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW MIGRATORY TIMING IS CONTROLLED. THIS PROJECT WILL USE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED LIGHTING REGIMES TO ISOLATE MIGRATORY PHYSIOLOGY FROM REPRODUCTION IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THOSE NEURAL MECHANISMS SPECIFIC TO MIGRATION. BY UNDERSTANDING HOW ANIMALS USE PHOTOPERIOD CUES TO TIME MIGRATION WE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO PREDICT THE SCOPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE TO WHICH MIGRATORY BIRDS CAN FLEXIBLY RESPOND, INFORMING CONSERVATION EFFORTS. THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE FUNDED RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR MULTIPLE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO BROADEN THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH BY ALLEVIATING THE CHOICE BETWEEN RESEARCH AND A PAYING JOB. BUILDING ON THE EQUIPMENT AND RESOURCES DEVELOPED BY THIS PROJECT, A SERIES OF PUBLIC OUTREACH RESOURCES ON MIGRATORY BIRD PHYSIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR USE AT EVENTS BOTH LOCALLY AND THROUGHOUT THE ALABAMA GULF COAST COMMUNITY. THE PROJECT WAS JOINTLY FUNDED BY THE BRC BIO PROGRAM AND THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR). THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS OF HOW SONGBIRDS DETECT AND INTEGRATE PHOTIC CUES FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT INTO THE COMPLEX ARRAY OF CHANGES IN PHYSIOLOGY, MORPHOLOGY, AND BEHAVIOR NECESSARY TO SUPPORT SPRING MIGRATION. PHOTOPERIOD CHANGES ARE WELL ESTABLISHED AS A PREDICTIVE CUE CONTROLLING MIGRATORY TIMING FOR MANY SPECIES. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING TIMING OF MIGRATION REMAIN OBSCURED. THIS IS BECAUSE BOTH SEASONAL MIGRATION AND REPRODUCTION BOTH RELY ON INCREASING SPRING PHOTOPERIOD AS A CUE AND REQUIRE THYROID HORMONE SIGNALING WITHIN THE BRAIN TO OCCUR. THIS OVERLAP BETWEEN MIGRATORY AND REPRODUCTIVE MECHANISMS HAS LIMITED THE UTILITY OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES THAT AIM TO IDENTIFY NEURAL MECHANISMS, AS WELL AS THE EFFICACY OF SIMPLE MANIPULATIVE EFFORTS SUCH AS THYROID KNOCKOUTS. THIS PROJECT LEVERAGES A PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED LOW INTENSITY GREEN LIGHT PARADIGM TO PHOTOSTIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF VERNAL MIGRATION WITHOUT TRIGGERING REPRODUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGY IN THE WELL-STUDIED WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW SYSTEM. THE PROJECT WILL THEN LOCALIZE NEURAL EXPRESSION OF DEEP BRAIN PHOTORECEPTORS CAPABLE OF DETECTING THIS LOW INTENSITY GREEN LIGHT CUE BY DEVELOPING CUSTOM ANTIBODIES FOR IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY. THEN THROUGH MULTI-TARGET IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS, IT WILL IDENTIFY MIGRATION SPECIFIC CHANGES IN NEURAL THYROID HORMONES SIGNALING. FINALLY, THE DIRECT ROLE OF PUTATIVE PHOTORECEPTOR CANDIDATES IN REGULATING MIGRATORY PHYSIOLOGY WILL BE TESTED BY AAV2 VIRAL VECTOR-MEDIATED SHRNAI KNOCKDOWN OF OPSIN EXPRESSION IN THE BRAIN FOLLOWED BY STIMULATION OF MIGRATION USING THE GREEN LIGHT PARADIGM.

CORAL RECOVERY AFTER A DISTURBANCE IS SHAPED, IN PART, BY WHETHER GRAZING HERBIVORES PREVENT HARMFUL ALGAE FROM BLOOMING AND TAKING OVER THE REEF. THIS IMPORTANT GRAZING ACTIVITY IS CARRIED OUT BY A DIVERSE GROUP OF CO-EXISTING HERBIVOROUS FISH SPECIES, SUCH AS PARROTFISHES AND SURGEONFISHES, WHICH COLLECTIVELY CONTROL ALGAE AND THEREBY FACILITATE CORAL RECOVERY. HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF ALGAE THAT MANY OF THESE FISH FEED ON IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. IT IS ALSO UNKNOWN IF THE FEEDING BEHAVIORS OF THESE HERBIVORES ARE CONSTANT, OR INSTEAD DEPEND ON REEF CONDITION SUCH AS LOSS OF CORAL. MORE DETAILED STUDIES OF HERBIVORE DIETS ARE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE SPECIES CO-EXIST, AS WELL AS WHICH SPECIES HAVE UNIQUE ROLES AND UNDERPIN KEY ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES ON MODERN REEFS. THE AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE THUS TO (A) DEFINE THE FEEDING BEHAVIORS AND DIETS OF HERBIVOROUS FISHES ON HEALTHY CORAL REEFS ? USING BOTH TRADITIONAL AND CUTTING-EDGE TECHNIQUES ? TO BETTER QUANTIFY RESOURCE PARTITIONING AMONG THESE HERBIVORES, AND (B) DETERMINE WHETHER AND HOW THE FEEDING ECOLOGY OF EACH HERBIVORE SHIFTS WITH CHANGING REEF CONDITIONS. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS FOCUSING ON CORE MEMBERS OF THE CORAL REEF HERBIVOROUS FISH ASSEMBLAGE AND QUANTIFYING THEIR FEEDING ECOLOGY ON REEFS THAT RANGE FROM MINIMALLY IMPACTED TO HEAVILY DEGRADED. BY REVEALING HIDDEN ASPECTS OF HERBIVORE FEEDING, AS WELL AS WHICH HERBIVOROUS FISHES SERVE UNIQUE ECOLOGICAL ROLES, THIS PROJECT STANDS TO RESHAPE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CORAL REEF ECOLOGY.

ON CORAL REEFS, MANY HERBIVOROUS FISH SPECIES CO-EXIST AND EXERT STRONG IMPACTS ON BENTHIC COMMUNITIES VIA TOP-DOWN CONTROL OF A DIVERSE ALGAL ASSEMBLAGE. HOWEVER, RESOURCE PARTITIONING AMONG THESE SPECIES IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND THE EXTENT OF NICHE OVERLAPS THAT EXIST AMONG HERBIVOROUS FISHES REMAINS UNKNOWN. IT ALSO REMAINS UNKNOWN HOW THE FEEDING ACTIVITIES AND DIET (I.E., THE ?TROPHIC NICHE?) OF EACH HERBIVORE SHIFTS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING ECOSYSTEM CONTEXT, SUCH AS THE LOSS OF CORAL. BROAD, HIGHER-RESOLUTION STUDIES ARE THUS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE SPECIES CO-EXIST, AS WELL AS WHICH SPECIES ARE FUNCTIONALLY UNIQUE AND UNDERPIN KEY ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES ON MODERN REEFS. THE RESEARCHERS? PRELIMINARY WORK SHOWED THAT DNA METABARCODING OF GUT CONTENTS, A CUTTING-EDGE TOOL, VASTLY IMPROVES NICHE DESCRIPTIONS FOR HERBIVOROUS FISHES. THIS TECHNIQUE ILLUMINATES FINE-SCALE DIFFERENCES AMONG SPECIES, THUS COMPLEMENTING PREVIOUS APPROACHES THAT, ALBEIT COARSER, QUANTIFY THE NICHE AT LARGER SCALES OF SPACE AND TIME.

TO MEET THESE OBJECTIVES, THE RESEARCHERS ARE CHARACTERIZING THE TROPHIC NICHES OF KEY MEMBERS OF THE CORAL REEF HERBIVOROUS FISH GUILD (VIA THE AFOREMENTIONED METHODS) AT NUMEROUS STUDY SITES THAT SPAN A GRADIENT OF REEF CONDITION. BY QUANTIFYING HERBIVORE NICHE OVERLAPS ON HEALTHY REEFS, SPECIES-LEVEL NICHE EXPANSIONS OR CONTRACTIONS AS A FUNCTION OF REEF DECLINE, AND RESULTANT IMPACTS TO TOTAL TROPHIC NICHE BREADTH, THIS RESEARCH IS RESHAPING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LARGE CONSUMERS ON CORAL REEFS, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGING FISHERIES AND REEF PROCESSES SIMULTANEOUSLY.

FOR THOSE WITH INSUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO EXERCISE BY THEMSELVES, ELECTRICITY CAN BE CAREFULLY APPLIED TO A MUSCLE TO GENERATE FORCE. THIS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY IS CALLED FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION (FES) AND FES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE MANY HEALTH BENEFITS. PRIOR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT REHABILITATION IS IMPROVED BY 1) REPETITION OF THE EXERCISE, AND 2) ACTIVE EFFORT INCLUDING FROM FES. FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS, WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE LIMIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF REHABILITATION THERAPY. ANOTHER LIMITATION OF FES-BASED EXERCISE IS THAT FES CAUSES FATIGUE TO OCCUR AT A FASTER RATE THAN NORMAL. FATIGUE CAN BE REDUCED BY USING A COMBINATION OF FES AND ROBOTICS (E.G., A POWERED CYCLE, OR A ROBOT ARM), CALLED HYBRID EXOSKELETONS. FOR EXAMPLE, APPLYING FES ONLY WHEN IT IS MOST EFFICIENT AND HAVING THE ROBOT HELP ONLY WHEN NEEDED WILL REDUCE FATIGUE WHILE ENCOURAGING ACTIVE EFFORT. FATIGUE CAN BE FURTHER REDUCED BY ADAPTIVELY CHANGING HOW MUCH THE FES AND ROBOT HELP IN THE EXERCISE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP SAFE ADAPTIVE METHODS FOR CONTROLLING HYBRID EXOSKELETONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY TRANSFORM THE REHABILITATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MOVEMENT DISORDERS. THROUGHOUT THIS PROJECT, THE PROJECT TEAM WILL INVITE MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN LAB TOURS AND/OR EXPERIMENTS THAT EVALUATE THE DESIGNED METHODS TO MOTIVATE THE STUDENTS TO SEEK OUT ADVANCED EDUCATION IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATH (STEM) FIELDS. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT ARISES FROM THE DESIGN, ANALYSIS, AND EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION OF SAFE SATURATED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK (DNN)-BASED FES CONTROLLERS WITH REAL-TIME CLOSED-LOOP (LYAPUNOV-BASED) DNN WEIGHT UPDATE LAWS, WHICH CAN APPROXIMATE THE COMPLEX DYNAMICS OF UPPER EXTREMITY HYBRID EXOSKELETONS AND GUARANTEE OVERALL SYSTEM STABILITY. OBJECTIVE 1 WILL DEVELOP A SATURATED, CONCURRENT LEARNING-INSPIRED, AND DNN-BASED FES CONTROL LAW THAT UPDATES THE DNN IN MULTIPLE TIMESCALES AND DEVELOP AN ADAPTIVE DNN- AND ADMITTANCE-BASED MOTOR CONTROLLER TO IMPROVE PARTICIPANT SAFETY. OBJECTIVE 2 WILL DEVELOP REAL-TIME AND LYAPUNOV-BASED ADAPTIVE UPDATE LAWS FOR BOTH THE INNER- AND OUTPUT-LAYER DNN WEIGHTS, WHILE THE EXOSKELETON'S MOTOR CONTROLLER WILL INCLUDE BARRIER FUNCTIONS TO CONSTRAIN THE EXOSKELETON WITHIN A USER-DEFINED SAFE SET. OBJECTIVE 3 WILL EXPERIMENTALLY EVALUATE THE PROPOSED CONTROLLERS IN POPULATIONS WITH AND WITHOUT MOVEMENT DISORDERS, SURVEY PARTICIPANTS FOR USER FEEDBACK, IDENTIFY THE MOST PROMISING CONTROL ARCHITECTURES, INVESTIGATE THE FES CONTROLLERS' POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MOTOR POWER REQUIREMENTS, AND DEVELOP NEW EXOSKELETON DESIGN GUIDELINES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT COULD TRANSFORM THE REHABILITATION INDUSTRY BY ENABLING MORE PERSONALIZED AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT CONTROL OF A HYBRID EXOSKELETON.

IN YOUNG ORGANISMS, NERVOUS SYSTEMS ARE HIGHLY PLASTIC; NEURAL CELLS CAN CHANGE THEIR SHAPE AND THEIR FUNCTION. IN OLDER NERVOUS SYSTEMS, LARGE-SCALE REORGANIZATIONS ARE UNUSUAL. CERTAIN GROWTH FACTORS, KNOWN AS NEUROTROPHINS, ARE THOUGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS EARLY NEURONAL FLEXIBILITY IN MANY ORGANISMS, FROM FLIES TO HUMANS. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER A FAMILY OF NEUROTROPHIC-LIKE GROWTH FACTORS INFLUENCES THE DEVELOPMENT, MAINTENANCE, AND PLASTICITY OF NEURONS IN DEVELOPING AND ADULT CRICKETS. THE CRICKET IS PARTICULARLY COMPELLING TO STUDY SINCE IT DEMONSTRATES AN UNUSUAL LEVEL OF NEURONAL FLEXIBILITY IN CIRCUITS RESPONSIBLE FOR HEARING. BECAUSE THESE GROWTH FACTORS ARE WELL-CONSERVED IN A VARIETY OF ORGANISMS, WHAT IS LEARNED FROM THESE CRICKET EXPERIMENTS WILL BE GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO CIRCUITS IN OTHER ORGANISMS. THE BROADER SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF THE WORK WILL BE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS OF NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND PLASTICITY.

NEUROTROPHINS ARE KNOWN TO MEDIATE THE SURVIVAL, DIFFERENTIATION, AND PLASTICITY OF DEVELOPING AND MATURE NEURONS IN MAMMALS. THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE FOR CROSS-TALK BETWEEN NEUROTROPHIN-TRK AND SEMAPHORIN-PLEXIN SIGNALING, WHICH SHAPES MAMMALIAN DENDRITIC MORPHOLOGY. THE ASSUMPTION THAT NEUROTROPHINS ARE ABSENT FROM INSECT NERVOUS SYSTEMS IS BEING CHALLENGED BY THE DISCOVERY OF TROPHIC-LIKE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SPAETZLE (SPZ) AND TOLL SIGNALING PATHWAY IN DROSOPHILA. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SPZ-TOLL FUNCTION IN INSECTS IS AKIN TO CANONICAL NEUROTROPHIC SIGNALING. THE CRICKET, GRYLLUS BIMACULATUS, IS SEPARATED FROM DROSOPHILA BY AN ESTIMATED 130 MILLION YEARS OF EVOLUTION. IT IS A COMPELLING MODEL IN WHICH TO EXPLORE NEUROTROPHIC SIGNALING DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE UNUSUAL STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY SEEN IN THE ADULT AFTER SENSORY ORGAN LOSS. THE PI AND HER STUDENTS WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SPZ-TOLL SIGNALING INFLUENCES THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CRICKET CNS. FURTHER, THEY WILL EXPLORE WHETHER THIS SIGNALING PLAYS A CAUSATIVE ROLE IN THE DEAFFERENTATION-INDUCED PLASTICITY PRESENT IN THE CRICKET AND WILL INITIATE AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER SPZ-TOLL SIGNALING INTERSECTS WITH SEMAPHORIN SIGNALING. DSRNA WILL BE USED TO MANIPULATE LEVELS OF SPZ, TOLL, SEMA OR PLEXIN CANDIDATES INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATION, AND RESULTING CHANGES IN DEVELOPMENTAL OR ADULT NEURONAL MORPHOLOGY WILL BE ASSESSED AND QUANTIFIED.

CONTROL OF GENE EXPRESSION OCCURS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS ? IMPORTANTLY, AT TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION AND MRNA SPLICING. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT TRANSCRIPTION AND SPLICING ARE CO-REGULATED AND THAT CHROMATIN STRUCTURE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THIS PROCESS. IN AN EARLIER STUDY, THE RESEARCH GROUP FOUND THAT PARP1, WHICH IS WELL KNOWN FOR DNA REPAIR, ALSO REGULATES ALTERNATIVE SPLICING. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND HOW PARP1-CHROMATIN COMPLEX COORDINATES RNA POLYMERASE II (RNAPII) ELONGATION, RNA, AND SPLICING FACTORS TO REGULATE CO-TRANSCRIPTIONAL SPLICING.

THIS WORK WOULD BE CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITH RESEARCHERS AT THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MERCURY RESEARCH LABORATORY (USGS MRL) IN MADISON, WISCONSIN. RECENT ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT PERMAFROST SOILS ARE A SIGNIFICANT RESERVOIR OF MERCURY, WHICH IS VULNERABLE TO RELEASE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THERMOKARST LAKES DEGRADE PERMAFROST RAPIDLY AND THUS, THERMOKARST LAKES MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN MOBILIZING MERCURY FROM PERMAFROST STORES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL FATE OF MERCURY IN THESE SYSTEMS REMAINS A MAJOR KNOWLEDGE GAP. THE MEASUREMENT OF NATURAL ABUNDANCE MERCURY ISOTOPE RATIOS, WHICH IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF CURRENT MERCURY RESEARCH, IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR MERCURY SOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF MERCURY BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING. TO DATE, MOST MERCURY ISOTOPE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN LOWER LATITUDE SYSTEMS. THUS, THERE IS LIMITED INFORMATION CHARACTERIZING THE ISOTOPIC ENDMEMBER OF PERMAFROST MERCURY, WHICH WOULD BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO RESEARCHERS AS THEY ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE FATE OF THIS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF MERCURY TO ARCTIC FOOD WEBS. THE LEAD RESEARCHER WILL MAKE EXTENDED VISITS TO THE USGS MRL, WHERE HE WILL MAKE USE OF STATE-OF-THE SCIENCE INSTRUMENTATION AND LEARN THE APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING, ANALYTICAL, AND INTERPRETATION SKILLS RELATED TO MERCURY ISOTOPE ANALYSES. WHILE AT THE USGS MRL, THE LEAD RESEARCHER WILL ALSO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH USGS EXPERTS TO ANALYZE NATURAL ABUNDANCE ISOTOPE RATIOS OF MERCURY IN SAMPLES OF AIR, WATER, SEDIMENT, PERMAFROST SOIL, AND EMERGENT INSECTS COLLECTED FROM THERMOKARST LAKES SPANNING A LATITUDINAL AND THAW GRADIENT. BY MEANS OF THESE ANALYSES, THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL IDENTIFY TO WHAT EXTENT PERMAFROST MERCURY IS ENTERING CONTEMPORARY THERMOKARST LAKE FOOD WEBS. RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE COMMUNICATED BROADLY. THE LEAD RESEARCHER WILL MAKE VISITS TO AN ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITY TO DISCUSS ENVIRONMENTAL MERCURY RESEARCH AND WILL DISSEMINATE PROJECT RESULTS IN CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS AND PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS.

SPECIFICALLY, AS THE ICE SHEETS RETREAT OVER LAND, IT BECOMES IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE LOCAL CLIMATE HAS ON THE MELTING OF ICE SHEET MARGINS. THUS, THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE THREEFOLD. INITIALLY, THE RESEARCHER WILL RECONSTRUCT RECORDS OF PAST CLIMATE (TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION) IN NEW ENGLAND. THE RECONSTRUCTED PAST CLIMATE WILL BE FROM APPROXIMATELY 13,000 YEARS AGO WHEN A LARGE ICE SHEET WAS RETREATING UNDER ANALOGOUS WARMING CONDITIONS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL ANALYZE ORGANIC MOLECULES FROM PLANTS AND BACTERIA LEFT BEHIND IN LAKE SEDIMENTS AND WHOSE FORM AND COMPOSITION REFLECT PAST CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION. SECOND, THE PI WILL COMPARE THESE NEW HIGH-RESOLUTION CLIMATE RECORDS TO EXISTING RECORDS OF CHANGES IN ICE SHEET MARGIN ACTIVITY TO ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF LOCAL CLIMATE ON THE MELTING AND RETREAT OF LARGE ICE SHEETS.

A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF LOCAL CLIMATE ON PAST ICE MARGIN BEHAVIOR IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND HOW MODERN ICE SHEET MARGINS WILL RESPOND TO CONTINUED CLIMATE CHANGE. THE RESEARCHER WILL PILOT THE GENERATION OF NEW, HIGH-RESOLUTION TEMPERATURE AND HYDROCLIMATE RECORDS FOLLOWING THE DEGLACIATION OF THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES BY THE LAURENTIDE ICE SHEET FOLLOWING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM. TEMPERATURE AND HYDROCLIMATE WILL BE RECONSTRUCTED USING BRANCHED GLYCEROL DIALKYL GLYCEROL TETRAETHERS (BRGDGTS) AND THE HYDROGEN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION (?2H) OF PRECIPITATION FROM PRESERVED LEAF WAXES, RESPECTIVELY, USING SEDIMENT CORES (IN-HAND AND TO-BE-COLLECTED) FROM CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND.

IN THIS PROJECT, THE PI AND A GRADUATE STUDENT WILL WORK WITH EXPERTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN TO DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON A HIGHLY ACCURATE MODELING TOOL AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING (HPC) THAT ENABLES AN ABERRATION-FREE PACT FOR TBI. BOTH THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE FRAMEWORK?S STABILITY AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PACT THEORY WILL BE ADVANCED.

THEY PLAY KEY ROLES IN NERVE AND MUSCLE RELAXATION, COGNITION, AND REGULATION OF BLOOD PRESSURE. WHILE K+ CHANNELS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED OVER MANY YEARS, THE MECHANISM OF ACTIVATION OF ION CHANNELS REMAINS A TOPIC OF ONGOING DEBATE THAT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO SOLVE WITH ESTABLISHED EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. TWO-DIMENSIONAL INFRARED (2D IR) SPECTROSCOPY IS AN EMERGING ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE THAT PROBES STRUCTURAL CHANGES OF PROTEINS WITH CHEMICAL BOND SPECIFIC SPATIAL AND HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES PERMIT APPLICATIONS OF 2D IR SPECTROSCOPY TO ION CHANNELS UNDER PHYSIOLOGICALLY REALISTIC CONDITIONS. THIS PROJECT COMBINES MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS WITH COMPUTATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY TO STUDY ACTIVATION MECHANISMS OF K+ CHANNELS. SIMULATIONS WILL BE VALIDATED BY 2D IR EXPERIMENTS AND, IN TURN, WILL BE USED TO DESIGN NEW EXPERIMENTS THAT CAN PROVIDE MOST CLEAR INSIGHT INTO ACTIVATION MECHANISMS OF K+ CHANNELS.

DESPITE A WEALTH OF NMR AND X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY DATA, MANY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE FUNCTION OF THE VSD REMAIN OPEN. IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE S4 HELICAL SEGMENT OF THE VSD UNDERGOES A CONFORMATIONAL AND/OR HYDRATIONAL CHANGE DURING VOLTAGE-GATING, BUT THIS HYPOTHESIS HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED BY A DIRECT STRUCTURAL MEASUREMENT BECAUSE MOST BIOPHYSICAL STRUCTURAL TECHNIQUES CANNOT BE PERFORMED UNDER APPLIED VOLTAGE. 2D IR SPECTROSCOPY CAN PROBE PROTEIN STRUCTURES WITH SITE-SPECIFIC RESOLUTION AND UNDER PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS INCLUDING APPLIED VOLTAGE. IT CAN ALSO PROBE THE GATING DYNAMICS OF THE VSD OCCURRING ON THE MILLISECOND TIMESCALE. RECENTLY THE SENSITIVITY OF 2D IR SPECTROSCOPY HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, MAKING IT UNIQUELY SUITABLE TO STUDY ION CHANNELS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL COMBINE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS WITH COMPUTATIONAL 2D IR SPECTROSCOPY TO ELUCIDATE THE CONFORMATIONAL AND HYDRATIONAL CHANGES OF THE VSD DURING VOLTAGE ACTIVATION. THE EXISTING STRUCTURAL MODELS OF THE VSD WILL BE SIMULATED AND TESTED AGAINST 2D IR EXPERIMENTS.

MNPS DELIVER A LOCAL, PAIN-FREE, SAFE, HIGH-EFFICIENCY, AND COST-EFFECTIVE WAY FOR DRUG AND VACCINE DELIVERY. THE SMALL NEEDLES ON MNPS ARE BARELY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE. THEREFORE, MANUFACTURING SUCH PRODUCTS WITH SUCH DETAILS REQUIRES STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNIQUES. AMONG DIFFERENT METHODS, ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES IS ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (3D PRINTING), WHICH ITSELF IS A COMPLEX PROCESS AND IS CONTROLLED BY VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL AND PHYSICAL PARAMETERS.

THIS RESEARCH PROJECT EXPLOITS THE SUPERIOR NONLINEAR NONVOLATILE SPIN-RELATED RESPONSES IN QUANTUM MATERIALS. THE KEY CHALLENGE TO IMPLEMENTING NEUROMORPHIC COMPUTING IS TO CREATE ARTIFICIAL NEURONS AND SYNAPSES WITH GREAT ENERGY EFFICIENCY. SPINTRONICS STUDY THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ELECTRON SPIN TRANSPORT AND CHARGE TRANSPORT, SO THEY NATURALLY COUPLE ELECTRONIC AND MAGNETIC CONFIGURATIONS, THUS OFFERING NON-VOLATILITY AND NONLINEARITY. NONVOLATILE SPINTRONICS MEMORY DEVICES CAN EMULATE ARTIFICIAL SYNAPSES AND NONLINEAR SPIN-TORQUE NANO-OSCILLATORS CAN EMULATE ARTIFICIAL NEURONS.

DUE TO THE CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN HEAT DISSIPATION, TRADITIONAL HEAT REMOVAL SYSTEM EMPLOYING HEAT SINK AND FAN OFTEN BECOMES INSUFFICIENT FOR THE MODERN ELECTRONICS TO MAINTAIN WITHIN THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE. THEREFORE, THIS RESEARCH IS DRIVEN BY THE NEED TO DEVELOP AN ADVANCED THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO REMOVE THE DISSIPATED HEAT SUFFICIENTLY AND MAINTAIN THE ELECTRONICS BELOW THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE AND HIGH RELIABILITY.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR ACHIEVING PROTEIN-POLYMER CONJUGATION THROUGH A SIMPLE YET STRONG NON-PERMANENT INTERACTION TO PRODUCE REGENERATIVE, PROTEIN DECORATED ?BIOACTIVE? SURFACES. THIS RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT TRACK-4 EPSCOR RESEARCH FELLOWS (RII TRACK-4) PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE A FELLOWSHIP TO AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AND TRAINING FOR A GRADUATE STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI (USM). PROTEINS PROVIDE A MYRIAD OF FUNCTIONS IMPORTANT TO HEALTH, AGRICULTURE, TRANSPORTATION, DEFENSE, FOOD PROCESSING AND MANY OTHERS. THIS DEMAND FOR PROTEINS HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE DESIRE TO FIND STRATEGIES TO INCORPORATE THESE BIOLOGICAL CATALYSTS INTO SYNTHETIC SYSTEMS, WHILE PROVIDING STABILITY AND LONGEVITY OF PROTEIN ACTIVITY. DESPITE SOME SUCCESSES IN DEVELOPING COVALENT PROTEIN-POLYMER CONJUGATES TO ACHIEVE THIS, CHALLENGES WITH COVALENT MODIFICATION REMAIN, LEADING TO REDUCED OR LOSS OF PROTEIN ACTIVITY RESULTING FROM PROTEIN DENATURATION. THIS PROJECT WILL EMPLOY SCALABLE HISTIDINE TAG (HIS-TAG) AFFINITY LIGAND CHEMISTRIES, DEVELOPED AND ROUTINELY USED FOR RECOMBINANT PROTEIN PURIFICATION, COUPLED WITH REVERSIBLE-ADDITION FRAGMENTATION CHAIN TRANSFER (RAFT) POLYMERIZATION AS A STRATEGY TO CREATE NON-COVALENT PROTEIN-POLYMER CONJUGATES TO COAT SURFACES AND IMPART BIOACTIVITY. UTILIZING THE HIS-TAG FOR CONJUGATION WILL ENSURE POLYMER ATTACHMENT AT THE SITE OF THE N- OR C-TERMINUS OF THE PROTEIN, AVOIDING POLYMER ATTACHMENT AT THE PROTEIN ACTIVE SITE, PREVENTING DENATURATION, WHILE BEING AMENABLE TO ALMOST ALL RECOMBINANT PROTEINS PURIFIED WITH THIS CHEMISTRY. THE NON-COVALENT COUPLING CHEMISTRY WILL ALLOW FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF PROTEIN SPECIFIC BIOACTIVE SURFACES, WITH THE EASE OF WASH REMOVAL AND RECOUPLING OF ACTIVE RECOMBINANT PROTEIN, CREATING A REGENERATIVE SURFACE, SUITABLE FOR WASTE REDUCTION. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROOF OF PRINCIPLE APPROACH WILL PROVIDE A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY SUITABLE FOR HIGH PERFORMING BIOACTIVE COATINGS.

THE DETECTION OF THESE CHEMICALS IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATRICES AND LIVING ORGANISMS (INCLUDING HUMANS) ALONG WITH THEIR HIGH STABILITY AND TOXICOGENIC POTENTIAL HAVE RAISED SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS. CONVENTIONAL WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PROCESSES ARE INEFFECTIVE AT REMOVING AND DEGRADING THESE CHEMICALS DUE TO THEIR HIGHLY STABLE CARBON-FLUORINE BONDS ALONG WITH VARYING HYDROPHOBICITY AND POLARITY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO DESIGN A NEW CLASS OF REACTIVE NANOCOMPOSITE MEMBRANE FILTERS THAT WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY SEPARATE THESE COMPOUNDS FROM WATER AND DEGRADE THEM TO LESS- OR NON-TOXIC BYPRODUCTS. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS WILL COMBINE EXPERTISE FROM NANOMATERIALS, MEMBRANE SEPARATIONS, AND ECOTOXICITY USING NOVEL PLANAR TWO-DIMENSIONAL NANOMATERIALS TO FABRICATE CATALYTIC NANOFILTRATION MEMBRANES WITH HIGH WATER FLOW RATE, STABILITY, AND ANTIFOULING PROPERTIES. THIS WILL ENABLE REMOVAL AND DEGRADATION OF THESE CHEMICALS WHICH ARE PRIORITY POLLUTANTS AS WELL AS OTHER EMERGING CHEMICALS IN THIS FAMILY OF COMPOUNDS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE 2D NANOMATERIALS AND RESULTING BYPRODUCTS WILL BE TESTED FOR THEIR TOXICITY TO MODEL ORGANISMS TO DETERMINE THE SUSTAINABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS NEW TREATMENT PROCESS.

COMMON RHIZARIA (E.G. ACANTHAREA, FORAMINIFERA, POLYCYSTINES, PHAEODAREA) FORM MINERAL SHELLS THAT ARE PART OF THE OCEAN?S STRONTIUM, SILICA, AND CARBON BUDGETS, AND THEY REPRESENT AT LEAST 5.2% OF THE OCEANIC BIOLOGICAL CARBON RESERVOIR IN THE SURFACE ZONE. BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF GROUPS OF RHIZARIA THAT ARE PRESENT, THEIR BIOMASS, AND HOW THEIR POPULATIONS CHANGE ACROSS DIFFERENT OCEAN DEPTHS IS ESSENTIAL TO MODEL OCEANIC NUTRIENT CYCLES, BUT THIS INFORMATION IS POORLY RESOLVED OR LACKING FOR LARGE RHIZARIA IN ONE OF THE LARGEST BIOMES ON EARTH, THE CENTRAL, LOW-NUTRIENT OCEAN GYRES. THIS COLLABORATIVE PROJECT INVOLVES A TEAM OF EARLY CAREER AND MORE ESTABLISHED INVESTIGATORS, PROVIDES MEASUREMENTS NEEDED TO DEVELOP A MODEL OF RHIZARIA CONTRIBUTION TO SINKING NUTRIENTS IN THE DEEP OCEAN, AND IS ADDING TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW NUTRIENTS MOVE IN THE OCEANS AND HOW CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AFFECT THOSE CYCLES. IT IS GENERATING LARGE DATASETS THAT CAN BE USED BY OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCHERS AND IS DELIVERING OCEANOGRAPHIC, BIOLOGICAL, AND DATA-SCIENCE THEMED EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

THE INVESTIGATORS ARE USING A COMBINATION OF NISKIN BOTTLE SAMPLING, PARTICLE GEL TRAPS, NET TOWS, AND CUTTING-EDGE IN SITU IMAGING (USING AN UNDERWATER VISION PROFILER, UVP5-DEEP) OF RHIZARIA TO BYPASS LIMITATIONS IN OTHER SAMPLING METHODS TO PRODUCE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF RHIZARIA BIOMASS. SAMPLING OCCURS ACROSS A WIDE DEPTH RANGE (0-1200 M), AT MONTHLY INTERVALS, AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF OTHER OCEANOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS COLLECTED AS PART OF THE BERMUDA ATLANTIC TIME-SERIES STUDY (BATS). UVP IMAGERY DATA IS INTEGRATED WITH MOLECULAR IDENTIFICATION OF RHIZARIA USING COMMUNITY METABARCODING, ZOOSCAN IMAGING, AND BARCODING OF INDIVIDUAL RHIZARIA COLLECTED FROM NET TOWS AND GEL TRAPS TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH UVP CASTS. THE INVESTIGATORS ARE USING SIZE-SPECIFIC ELEMENTAL ANALYSES OF RHIZARIA AND SEASONALLY AND VERTICALLY EXPLICIT ESTIMATES OF RHIZARIA BIOMASS TO MODEL RHIZARIA CONTRIBUTIONS TO VERTICAL FLUX. ALONG WITH DATA COLLECTED BY THE BERMUDA ATLANTIC TIME SERIES AND OCEAN FLUX PROGRAM, NEW DATA ON RHIZARIA ARE BEING INCORPORATED INTO A MODEL OF CARBON AND NUTRIENT TRANSFER INTO THE DEEP OCEAN.

NATIONAL DATA SHOW A DIRE NEED FOR HIGHER EDUCATION TO MORE EQUITABLY SERVE STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS, ESPECIALLY STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS (URG) AND TRANSFER STUDENTS. THESE TWO POPULATIONS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS PROJECT CREATES A ?4C MODEL? FOR SYSTEMIC CHANGE IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) EDUCATION. THE MODEL FEATURES STUDENTS AS CO-CREATORS, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDENT AGENCY AND LEADERSHIP IN CHANGE EFFORTS. THE 4 ?CS? STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN ARE CO-MENTORING (A NON-HIERARCHICAL APPROACH TO MENTORING), COMMUNITY-BUILDING ACTIVITIES, CAREER DEVELOPMENT, AND CONTENT-AREA RESEARCH EXPERIENCES. THESE ARE ALL EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS? TRANSITIONS INTO AND THROUGH COLLEGE AND TO PREPARE THEM FOR POST-GRADUATION TRANSITIONS. THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES FACULTY- AND INSTITUTIONAL-LEVEL ACTIVITIES TO ADVANCE SYSTEMIC CHANGE, INCLUDING FACULTY CO-MENTORING WITH STUDENTS AND A SYNERGIES BOARD CONVENED REGULARLY TO FACILITATE KNOWLEDGE AND INTERPERSONAL EXCHANGE ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY, WHILE CHANGING POWER STRUCTURES TO ELEVATE STUDENTS? PERSPECTIVES. THE FOCUS ON WORKFORCE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL PREPARATION IS NECESSARY TO IMPACT THE RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF THE REGION, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT IS BROADER. IT WILL SERVE AS A MODEL THAT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION CAN ADOPT TO INCREASE SUCCESSFUL STUDENT OUTCOMES AMONG STUDENTS FROM URG AND TRANSFER POPULATIONS. THE WORK AND KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED BY THESE STUDENTS IN THEIR FUTURE STEM CAREERS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE FURTHER IMPACTS. BECAUSE IT IS INFORMED BY SELF DETERMINATION THEORY (SDT) AND FOUR FRAMES THEORY, THE PROJECT WILL BE VALUABLE TO EDUCATORS AND RESEARCHERS BY DEVELOPING AND ASSESSING AN ACTIONABLE THEORY-INTO-PRACTICE PROGRAM (THE 4C MODEL). THE OVERALL PROJECT GOAL IS TO INCREASE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF STUDENTS FROM URG AND TRANSFER POPULATIONS IN STEM RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONS AS MEASURED USING METRICS SUCH AS RETENTION, GRADUATION, AND TRANSITION TO CAREER. THE THREE OBJECTIVES ARE TO 1) BUILD ON EXISTING STUDENT SUPPORTS BY CREATING AND ASSESSING NEW STRUCTURES AND PROGRAMS FOR SUPPORTING URG AND TRANSFER STUDENTS AS THEY PREPARE FOR POST-GRADUATE CAREERS, 2) OFFER FACULTY AND STAFF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO MORE INCLUSIVELY AND EXPERTLY FACILITATE THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF THE FOCUS STUDENTS TO POST-GRADUATE CAREERS, AND 3) COMBINE UNITS AND PEOPLE ACROSS CAMPUS IN SUPPORT OF OBJECTIVES 1 & 2 INTO A SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PROJECT?S PRIMARY STRATEGIES INCLUDE CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING THE ?4C? MODEL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM TO SUPPORT STUDENTS FROM THE FOCUS POPULATIONS THROUGH SCHOLARSHIPS AND THE FOUR TYPES OF ACTIVITIES LISTED ABOVE, INCLUDING CO-MENTORING WHERE STUDENTS AND FACULTY CO-MENTOR EACH OTHER. ADDITIONALLY, FACULTY WILL PARTICIPATE IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO BETTER SERVE THESE POPULATIONS AND EXPERIENCE PROFESSIONAL GROWTH THROUGH CO-MENTORING EXPERIENCES WITH STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM. THE PROJECT?S SYNERGIES BOARD AIMS TO IMPROVE COLLABORATION AND STREAMLINING BETWEEN STEM DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER UNITS ON CAMPUS. THE RESEARCH COMPONENT SEEKS TO IMPROVE LEVELS OF DIVERSITY IN THE STEM WORKFORCE FROM A NEW STANDPOINT BY EXTENDING THE APPLICATION OF SDT TO INCREASE THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF URG AND TRANSFER STUDENTS IN STEM-RELATED ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE IDENTIFICATION AND STRENGTHENING OF KEY TRANSITION POINTS INTO AND OUT OF COLLEGE. THE EXTENSION OF SDT WILL TRANSFORM HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONAL APPROACHES TO STEM STUDENT SUCCESS FROM BEING REACTIVE TO PROACTIVE. THIS RESEARCH WILL BE THE FIRST THAT TAKES A SYSTEMIC CHANGE APPROACH TO EXTEND SDT THEORY BY EVALUATING HOW THE FOUR FRAMES FOR SYSTEMIC CHANGE (STRUCTURES, SYMBOLS, PEOPLE, AND POWER) INTERACT WITH SDT?S AUTONOMY, COMPETENCE, AND RELATEDNESS TO INCREASE STEM URG AND TRANSFER STUDENTS?

COMPARATIVE GENOMIC APPROACHES BASED ON WHOLE GENOMES WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY LOCI RELATED TO FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATIONS, INCLUDING SIGNATURES OF MOLECULAR ADAPTATION AND CONVERGENCE, AS WELL AS GENE FAMILY EXPANSIONS AND CONTRACTIONS. ULTIMATELY THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE AN EVOLUTIONARY FRAMEWORK TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS REGULATING ADAPTIVE RADIATIONS ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS.

THOUGH THIS ABILITY SEEMS NATURAL TO HUMANS, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE IN SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, CURRENT CONTINUOUS LEARNING METHODS ARE TRAINED UNDER UNREALISTIC CONDITIONS AND REQUIRE SUPERVISION. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO ENDOW AUTONOMOUS AGENTS, SUCH AS ROBOTS, WITH THE ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCY OF BIOLOGY. BIOLOGICAL PLASTICITY IN WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH WILL GUIDE ENGINEERING OF NEW MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS. THESE ALGORITHMS WILL ENABLE AUTONOMOUS AGENTS TO CONTINUOUSLY SENSE AND ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT INTERRUPTING OPERATIONS FOR MANUAL TRAINING. THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT IS INTEGRATED WITH A RANGE OF OUTREACH ACTIVITIES INVOLVING LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. WORKSHOPS AND DEMONSTRATIONS ON BIOLOGY-INSPIRED MACHINE LEARNING WILL BE ORGANIZED, AIMED AT SPURRING INTEREST OF RURAL STUDENTS IN CODING AND ROBOTICS. A GRAND CHALLENGE IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IS HOW TO ACHIEVE UNSUPERVISED CONTINUAL LEARNING IN THE OPEN WORLD. CURRENT METHODS USED IN AI AND MACHINE LEARNING OPERATE WITH SINGLE-MODALITY DATA, COLLECTED AND CONSUMED IN CONTROLLED CONDITIONS, TYPICALLY IN A SUPERVISED MANNER. HOWEVER, BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ACHIEVE LIFELONG LEARNING BY PROCESSING STREAMS OF MULTISENSORY DATA THAT CONTINUOUSLY SHAPE THEIR NEURAL NETWORKS (PLASTICITY) WHILE RETAINING PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE (STABILITY). THIS DYNAMIC ADAPTATION OPERATES UNSUPERVISED, ON A RANGE OF TIMESCALES AND RULES. THE PROJECT WILL STUDY THOSE PRINCIPLES OBSERVED IN THE CEREBELLAR FEEDBACK PATHWAYS OF ELECTRIC FISH, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DRIVING PLASTICITY, ENABLING ADAPTATION OF ITS FUNCTION AT DIFFERENT TIMESCALES AND LEARNING AND FORGETTING AT MULTIPLE SPEEDS. THIS WILL ENABLE THE TRANSLATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL PARADIGMS IN CONTINUAL LEARNING THAT WILL SUPPORT NEW LEVELS OF RESILIENCY AND LIFELONG LEARNING IN REAL-TIME AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS IN THE OPEN WORLD. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THE PROJECT WILL OVERCOME SOME KEY TECHNICAL HURDLES, E.G., IN ENABLING 1) DATA EFFICIENCY IN PROCESSING INPUTS CONTINUOUSLY AS TIME-VARIANT, POTENTIALLY CORRELATED, DATA STREAMS IN A FULLY UNSUPERVISED MANNER; 2) FLEXIBILITY TO LEARN AND FORGET AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS; 3) GENERATION OF SUITABLE INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS FROM MULTIPLE MODALITIES TO IMPROVE AUTONOMOUS RESILIENCE.

ATP FUELS NEARLY ALL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR IN THE BODY, SHAPING THE ENERGY UTILIZATION STRATEGY AND PACE OF LIFE FOR EACH SPECIES. MITOCHONDRIA ALTER THEIR SHAPE (MORPHOLOGY) AND MOVE WITHIN THE CELL TO INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER, A PROCESS REFERRED TO AS MITOCHONDRIAL BEHAVIOR WHICH APPEARS TO AFFECT ATP PRODUCTION. THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESES ARE BEING TESTED: 1) CHANGES IN MITOCHONDRIAL MORPHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR INCREASE ATP PRODUCTION, AND 2) MITOCHONDRIAL BEHAVIOR AND MORPHOLOGY PLAY KEY ROLES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANIMALS, AS INDICATED BY HOW THEY RESPOND TO LOW FOOD AVAILABILITY, REPRODUCTION, AND AGING. THESE IDEAS WILL BE TESTED IN TWO DISTANTLY RELATED SPECIES, A COPEPOD (A SPECIES OF ZOOPLANKTON FOUND IN TIDE POOLS) AND THE HOUSE MOUSE. IN ADDITION, RESEARCH ON MITOCHONDRIA WILL BE USED AS A PLATFORM FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF SCIENCE LITERACY IN ALABAMA. IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL BIOLOGY TEACHERS, AN INTEGRATIVE AND INSPIRING LABORATORY FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WILL BE CREATED.

GIVEN THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY, AND SOCIETAL WELL-BEING, CHANGES IN FAMILY SIZE HAVE BEEN INTENSIVELY STUDIED, AND YET REMAIN POORLY RESOLVED, PARTICULARLY WITHIN CONTEXTS WHERE RELATIVELY LARGE FAMILY SIZES REMAIN NORMATIVE. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT USES THEORY FROM CULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT LIVELIHOOD DIVERSIFICATION MAY PLAY IN DRIVING FAMILY SIZE IN MIXED (SUBSISTENCE AND MARKET) ECONOMIES. IT CREATES NEW COLLABORATIONS AMONG MINORITY-SERVING INSTITUTIONS AND RESEARCH-INTENSIVE INSTITUTIONS, OFFERS SIGNIFICANT, FULLY REMUNERATED TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, INCLUDING IN FIELD, LABORATORY, AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS, AND SUPPORTS BOTH EARLY CAREER AND UNDERREPRESENTED SCHOLARS.

ITS FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO TEST WHETHER AND HOW ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL FACTORS INFLUENCE IDEAL AND REALIZED FAMILY SIZES. ITS SECOND IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW FAMILY SIZE AFFECTS CHILDREN?S DAILY ACTIVITIES, BOTH PRODUCTIVE AND CONSUMPTIVE, AND HOW ACTIVITY PROFILES INFLUENCE CHILDREN?S NUTRITION, ENERGETICS, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND WELL-BEING. TO DO SO, INVESTIGATORS COLLECT DATA FROM A LARGE SAMPLE OF CHILDREN RESIDING IN MARKET-INTEGRATED, MIXED, AND SUBSISTENCE ECONOMIES, INCLUDING DATA DRAWN FROM SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRES THAT CHARACTERIZE LIVELIHOODS AND CULTURAL NORMS SURROUNDING FAMILY SIZE, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND DIETARY LOGS, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC AND BIOMARKER ASSESSMENTS OF HEALTH.

INCREASED CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE PLANT BIOMASS, THEREBY REMOVING CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND SEQUESTERING IT IN THE BIOSPHERE. HOWEVER, PLANT GROWTH CAN BE LIMITED BY NUTRIENT LIMITATION, PREVENTING PLANTS FROM CONVERTING HIGHER CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS INTO BIOMASS THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS. ONE WAY TO INCREASE NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY TO ECOSYSTEMS IS TO MOBILIZE NUTRIENTS FROM BEDROCK THROUGH WEATHERING, OR THE BREAKING DOWN OF ROCKS AND MINERALS AT EARTH?S SURFACE. THIS RESEARCH ACTIVITY WILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT OF A MID-CAREER RESEARCHER. INCREASED ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CAN INCREASE PHOTOSYNTHESIS, BUT OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING NUTRIENT LIMITATION, DROUGHT, AND CHANGES TO CARBON DYNAMICS IN SOILS MAY AFFECT TROPICAL FORESTS?

AMBIGUITY, THE ASSIGNMENT OF MULTIPLE REPRESENTATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS FOR ONE UTTERANCE, IS AN UNDESIRABLE BYPRODUCT OF LANGUAGE USE FOR EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION; NEVERTHELESS, AMBIGUITY IS PERVASIVE IN LANGUAGE PERFORMANCE, SINCE MENTAL LINGUISTIC REPRESENTATIONS HAVE A HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE, YET LANGUAGE EXTERNALIZATION IS LINEAR DUE TO SENSORY-MOTOR CONSTRAINTS. THIS HYBRID-ARCHITECTURE SYMBOLIC PARSER AND NEURAL LEXICON SYSTEM (HASPNEL) JUDGES WHETHER A GIVEN UTTERANCE IS GRAMMATICAL AND DETECTS WHETHER IT IS AMBIGUOUS AT THE WORD OR SENTENCE LEVEL. HASPNEL IS ALSO A COMPUTATIONAL COGNITIVE MODEL OF HUMAN LANGUAGE FOLLOWING CURRENT SYNTACTIC THEORY ON MINIMALIST GRAMMARS, WHICH MUST SATISFY CONDITIONS OF LEARNABILITY, EVOLVABILITY, AND UNIVERSALITY.

INVESTIGATING CONSEQUENCES OF HETEROBLASTY UNDER INCREASING ARIDITY IN NEW ZEALAND FORESTS -FOREST TREES ARE EXPERIENCING INCREASED PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS DUE TO RISING TEMPERATURES, LESS PREDICTABLE RAINFALL, AND MORE EXTREME EVENTS SUCH AS EXTREME HEATWAVES, STORMS, AND FLOODS. BECAUSE PLANTS CHANGE CONSIDERABLY IN FORM AND FUNCTION AS THEY GROW FROM SEEDLINGS TO JUVENILES TO ADULTS, THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON PLANT SURVIVAL AND GROWTH ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE WITH PLANT AGE. THIS COULD HAVE LARGE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PERSISTENCE OF SPECIES ON THE LANDSCAPE. FOR EXAMPLE, AN UNUSUALLY HOT OR ARID CLIMATE PERIOD AFTER A DISTURBANCE THAT KILLS ADULT TREES (LIKE A HURRICANE OR A FOREST FIRE), COULD CAUSE HIGH MORTALITY OF REGENERATING TREE SEEDLINGS THEREBY LIMITING FOREST RECOVERY. ADDITIONALLY, UNUSUAL CLIMATE STRESSORS SUCH AS PROLONGED DROUGHT, COULD LEAD TO DIEBACK OF ADULT TREES WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR WATERSHED FUNCTIONING, CARBON STORAGE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT. AT THE INDIVIDUAL PLANT SPECIES SCALE, WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW PLANTS WILL TOLERATE CLIMATE CHANGE AS THEY GROW FROM JUVENILES TO ADULTS, PARTICULARLY FOR LONG-LIVED PLANTS THAT EXPERIENCE CHANGING CLIMATES WITHIN THEIR LIFETIMES. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS ON SEVERAL FOREST TREE SPECIES BY COMPARING THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTINCT JUVENILE FORMS VERSUS ADULT STAGE TREES OF SEVERAL SPECIES IN NEW ZEALAND FORESTS IN RESPONSE TO SIMULATED DROUGHTS OF TWO DIFFERENT KINDS. THESE FORESTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED IN AREA BY LAND USE CHANGE AND INTRODUCED ANIMALS, AND THEIR UNIQUE BIODIVERSITY IS NOW BEING THREATENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. ISLAND PLANTS MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE DUE TO THEIR LIMITED DISTRIBUTIONS AND POTENTIALLY LIMITED OVERALL FLEXIBILITY IN GROWTH TRAITS COMPARED TO MAINLAND FOREST TREE SPECIES. THIS WORK WILL EVALUATE EXISTING VARIABILITY WITHIN EACH SPECIES ACROSS A NATURAL CLIMATE GRADIENT AND EVALUATE HOW DIFFERENT POPULATIONS RESPOND TO DROUGHT IN A CONTROLLED GREENHOUSE SETTING. THE STUDY WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DROUGHT TOLERANCE IN DIFFERENT LIFE STAGES OF THESE FOREST TREES, HELP TO IDENTIFY THE CLIMATE CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT BE REFUGIA WHERE THESE SPECIES CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST AS BOTH SEEDLINGS AND ADULTS AS CLIMATE WARMS AND DRIES, AND ALSO AREAS ON THE LANDSCAPE WHERE POPULATIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO MORTALITY BECAUSE OF JUVENILE SENSITIVITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE OR ADULT TREE DEATH. THIS INFORMATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSERVATION OF NATIVE ISLAND SPECIES WHILE ENGAGING NATIVE PACIFIC ISLAND STUDENTS, AND INDIGENOUS FOREST MANAGERS IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS. PLANTS CHANGE CONSIDERABLY IN FORM AND FUNCTION AS THEY GROW, WITH THE RESULT THAT SEEDLINGS AND JUVENILE TREES USUALLY DIFFER FROM ADULT TREES IN LEAF SHAPE, RATES OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND WATER USE, AND IN THE PRODUCTION OF SPINES AND TOXINS AS DEFENSE AGAINST HERBIVORES. SUCH ONTOGENETIC CHANGES ARE THOUGHT TO HELP PLANTS SURVIVE AND GROW THROUGH ENVIRONMENTS THAT ALSO SHIFT AS PLANTS MATURE. FOR EXAMPLE, SEEDLINGS GROW NEAR THE GROUND WHERE IT IS COLDER, DRIER, SHADIER, AND LESS WINDY THAN THE ENVIRONMENT ADULT PLANTS EXPERIENCE, AND THEY MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT TYPES AND INTENSITIES OF HERBIVORY. FOR MANY PLANT SPECIES, THE SHIFTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AS PLANTS PASS THROUGH DEVELOPMENTAL PHASES ARE PREDICTABLE, LEADING TO THE EVOLUTION OF FIXED DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN PLANT FORM AND FUNCTION, A LIFE HISTORY KNOWN AS HETEROBLASTY. CLIMATE CHANGE IS INTRODUCING NEW VARIABILITY WITHIN SHORT TIME SCALES, INCLUDING MORE CONSECUTIVE DAYS WITHOUT RAIN, MORE EXTREME RAINFALL EVENTS, AND DIRECTIONAL CHANGES IN MEAN ANNUAL RAINFALL. HOW THESE CLIMATIC CHANGES WILL AFFECT PLANTS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIMES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH FIXED ONTOGENETIC SHIFTS IN FORM AND FUNCTION, IS UNCLEAR. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES HOW SPECIES WITH FIXED (HOMOBLASTIC) VERSUS FLEXIBLE (HETEROBLASTIC) ONTOGENETIC SHIFTS IN FORM AND FUNCTION PERFORM UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE USING A COMBINATION OF APPROACHES, INCLUDING FIELD STUDIES TO MEASURE MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS IN SEEDLINGS AND ADULTS ACROSS DIFFERENT CLIMATES, AND GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENTS TO TEST THE DEGREE TO WHICH PLANT TRAITS ARE PLASTIC UNDER SIMULATED CLIMATE CHANGE CONDITIONS. MANY SPECIES WITH FIXED DEVELOPMENTAL PATTERNS OCCUR ON ISLANDS WHERE SPECIES ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIMITED RANGES THAT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY HISTORIC LAND USE CHANGE. HENCE, THIS PROJECT WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN NEW ZEALAND WHERE HETEROBLASTY IS COMMON. THIS WORK WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS ON PLANTS AS THEY GROW UP, AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSERVATION OF NATIVE ISLAND SPECIES UNDER THE THREAT OF GLOBAL CHANGE. IT WILL ENGAGE NATIVE PACIFIC ISLAND STUDENTS IN RESEARCH, AND WILL WORK WITH INDIGENOUS FOREST KNOWLEDGE HOLDERS TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON IMPORTANT ISLAND TREE SPECIES AND THEIR POTENTIAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

OUR CONVERGENT RESEARCH TEAMS ACROSS THREE EPSCOR JURISDICTIONS (ME, NH AND VT) WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY TO CREATE: (A) NEW AI MODELS WITH INTRINSIC INTERPRETABILITY AND INCREASED ADAPTABILITY TO SUPPORT ADVANCED MANUFACTURING (ADVMFG); (B) AI-GUIDED DESIGN FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING OF METALS THAT SEAMLESSLY CONNECTS MULTI-SCALE MODELING AND PROPERTY PREDICTIONS WITHOUT UNNECESSARY TRIAL-AND-ERROR; (C) SELF-AWARE CNC MACHINES THAT OPTIMIZE THE COORDINATION AND CONTROL IN SUBTRACTIVE MANUFACTURING; (D) INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS THAT EFFICIENTLY AND SAFELY LEARN FROM VIDEO DEMONSTRATIONS FOR CELLULAR MANUFACTURING; (E) AN INDUSTRY-DRIVEN, UNIFIED HYBRID MANUFACTURING FRAMEWORK; AND (F) AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES BY MANUFACTURING BUSINESSES. THE PROJECT ANTICIPATES SPECIFIC OUTCOMES THAT WILL BE OF IMMEDIATE RELEVANCE TO ADVMFG COMPANIES IN NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE PROJECT WILL YIELD SAMPLE-EFFICIENT ROBOT LEARNING TECHNIQUES THAT WILL ENABLE FACTORY WORKERS TO TEACH ROBOTS NEW SKILLS THROUGH VISUAL DEMONSTRATIONS, ALLOW ROBOTS TO LEARN FROM FAILURE AND REQUEST RELEVANT DEMONSTRATIONS, AND GENERATE RISK-BOUNDED SAFE POLICIES USING UNCERTAINTY AWARE LEARNING. THIS PROJECT WILL SERVE THE NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND MANUFACTURING SECTOR THROUGH RELEVANT RESEARCH, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND EDUCATION. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS ARE INTEGRATED TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO STEM EDUCATION FOR UNDERREPRESENTED, LOW INCOME, POTENTIAL FIRST-GENERATION, AND/OR DISABLED INDIVIDUALS.

BIOLOGICS INCLUDE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MABS) AND OTHER THERAPEUTIC PROTEINS, VACCINES SUCH AS MRNA VACCINES, CELL AND GENE THERAPIES PRODUCTS SUCH AS STEM CELLS, AND VIRAL VECTORS. THE IMPACT OF BIOLOGICS ON HUMAN HEALTH HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS WITH THE SUCCESS OF MRNA VACCINES FOR COVID-19 AS AN EXAMPLE. THE MARKET FOR BIOLOGICS IS INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY, REACHING OVER $300 BILLION AS OF TODAY. THE LARGE DEMAND FOR BIOLOGICS PLACES GREAT CHALLENGE ON THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE TOTAL COST FOR DOWNSTREAM PROCESS ACCOUNTS FOR UP TO 80% OF THE TOTAL MANUFACTURING COST. THE VISION OF THIS RII TRACK-2 FEC PROJECT IS TO CREATE A MEMBRANE-BASED DOWNSTREAM PURIFICATION PLATFORM FOR THE FUTURE LARGE SCALE BIOMANUFACTURING OF VIRAL VECTORS AND VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES (VLPS) FOR GENE THERAPY AND VACCINE APPLICATIONS. THIS PLATFORM WILL BE USED TO REPLACE THE CURRENT PROCESSES SUCH AS CENTRIFUGATION AND RESIN-BASED CHROMATOGRAPHY THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO SCALE UP. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND PRACTICAL UNIT OPERATIONS THAT COULD BE PART OF A PLATFORM FOR THE DOWNSTREAM PURIFICATION OF THESE VIRUS PARTICLE-BASED THERAPEUTICS. THE PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCHERS WITH COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE FROM THREE EPSCOR JURISDICTIONS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS (ARKANSAS), CLEMSON UNIVERSITY (SOUTH CAROLINA) AND UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY (KENTUCKY). EACH OF THE THREE INSTITUTIONS OFFERS UNIQUE FACILITIES AND RESOURCES THAT CAN RAPIDLY CATALYZE THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES ON THE ENTIRE STATE OF ARKANSAS AS WELL AS ON KENTUCKY AND SOUTH CAROLINA WILL BE SIGNIFICANT. REGIONAL INCUBATOR CENTERS FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY OF TOMORROW WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN THE THREE EPSCOR STATES. SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH-PRODUCTIVITY MEMBRANE PURIFICATION PLATFORM IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH BY IMPROVING ACCESS TO REVOLUTIONARY TREATMENTS FOR GENETIC AND CHRONIC DISEASES FOR MID- AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE FUTURE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY, A COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH MINORITY-SERVING INSTITUTIONS, AND A FOCUS ON EARLY CAREER FACULTY MENTORSHIP ARE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATES TO DEVELOP THE STEM WORKFORCE IN THIS FIELD. IN ADDITION, ALL THREE UNIVERSITIES WILL OUTREACH TO THE RESPECTIVE MINORITY-SERVING INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE TO FOSTER COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES. DEVELOPMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVE LARGE SCALE BIOMANUFACTURING FOR THE PURIFICATION OF VIRAL VECTORS AND VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES (VLPS) IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. MEMBRANE BASED UNIT OPERATIONS ARE ATTRACTIVE; HOWEVER, MEMBRANE CAPACITY, FOULING AND LACK OF COMMERCIAL MEMBRANES AS WELL AS THE ROBUSTNESS OF MEMBRANE PERFORMANCE UNDER A RANGE OF OPERATING CONDITIONS HAVE LIMITED APPLICATIONS BY INDUSTRIAL PRACTITIONERS. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS KEY ISSUES AND OVERCOME CRITICAL BARRIERS FOR DEVELOPING A MEMBRANE-BASED BIOPROCESSING PLATFORM FOR VIRAL VECTORS AND VLPS. THE PROJECT AIMS TO OVERCOME THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS AT MULTIPLE FRONTS AND INVOLVE CLOSE COLLABORATIONS AMONG RESEARCHERS AT THREE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS IN THREE EPSCOR JURISDICTIONS. MORE SPECIFIC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES INCLUDE (1) FEEDSTOCK PRODUCTION OF TWO COMMON VIRAL VECTORS FOR GENE THERAPY APPLICATIONS AND VLPS FOR VACCINE APPLICATIONS; (2) ADVANCED MICROFILTRATION OPERATIONS FOR BIOREACTOR HARVESTING; (3) HIGH CAPACITY AFFINITY MEMBRANE DESIGN, FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION; (4) DOWNSTREAM MEMBRANE CHROMATOGRAPHY FOR SEPARATING FULL AND EMPTY VIRAL CAPSIDS; (5) MODULE DESIGN, PROCESS OPTIMIZATION AND PROCESS INTENSIFICATION; (6) EMPLOYING STATE-OF-THE-ART BIOANALYTICAL METHODS FOR DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION; AND (7) A TECHNOLOGY READINESS AND ACCEPTANCE STUDY.

SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS POLLUTANTS INCLUDE PESTICIDES AND HEAVY METALS, SUCH AS LEAD AND ARSENIC. THESE SUBSTANCES NOT ONLY GET INTO OUR DRINKING WATER, BUT THEIR ACCUMULATION IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS CAN MAKE FOOD UNSAFE IN MANY COMMUNITIES, ADVERSELY AFFECTING HUMAN HEALTH. YET, BODIES OF WATER ARE OFTEN TESTED ONLY ONCE A YEAR DUE TO MANUAL COLLECTION PROCEDURES AND LARGE, COSTLY EQUIPMENT TO MEASURE POLLUTANTS. THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE SMALL, PRINTABLE SENSORS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURE TOXIC HEAVY METALS AND PESTICIDES ON-SITE TO ENABLE WIDESPREAD ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEILLANCE IN BODIES OF WATER, AND TO MEASURE LEVELS OF HEAVY METALS IN HUMAN POPULATIONS. THE PROJECT WILL RECRUIT AND TRAIN A DIVERSE WORKFORCE TO DESIGN, TEST, AND PRODUCE THESE NEW TYPES OF SENSORS.

IT WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO FORMING A CITIZENRY THAT IS INCREASINGLY AWARE OF GLOBAL HEALTH ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. FRESHWATER SNAILS OF THE GENUS BIOMPHALARIA SERVE AS INTERMEDIATE HOSTS FOR THE DIGENETIC TREMATODE SCHISTOSOMA MANSONI. WITHIN THE INTERMEDIATE HOST, TREMATODE LARVAE MULTIPLY AND TRANSFORM INTO THE CERCARIAE THAT CAN INFECT THEIR MAMMALIAN DEFINITIVE HOSTS. LARVAL PROLIFERATION IS FACILITATED BY MODIFICATIONS OF HOST BEHAVIOR AND PHYSIOLOGY, INCLUDING A REDUCTION OF REPRODUCTION KNOWN AS ?PARASITIC CASTRATION?. AS A SIMULTANEOUS HERMAPHRODITE, THE MALE AND FEMALE SYSTEMS OF EACH BIOMPHALARIA SPECIMEN MUST BE HIGHLY REGULATED AND COORDINATED. SEVERAL NEUROPEPTIDES ARE AMONG THE SIGNALING SYSTEMS THAT CONTROL GASTROPOD REPRODUCTION. THIS STUDY EXPLORES TWO NEUROPEPTIDES THAT WERE RECENTLY DESCRIBED IN BIOMPHALARIA; A GONADOTROPIN RELEASING HORMONE-RELATED PEPTIDE THAT IS PROPOSED TO REGULATE THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND A FAMILY OF FMRF-NH2 RELATED PEPTIDES THAT CONTROL THE MALE MATING APPARATUS. NEUROPEPTIDE EXPRESSION WILL BE INVESTIGATED ACROSS THE PREPATENT PHASE OF INFECTION. THE MRNA THAT ENCODES THE PEPTIDE PRECURSORS WILL BE DETECTED USING A NOVEL IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION TECHNIQUE (HYBRIDIZATION CHAIN REACTION) AND THE MATURE PEPTIDES WILL BE LOCALIZED WITH IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY. SYNAPTIC SIGNALING THROUGH A FMRF-NH2 GATED ION CHANNEL WILL BE INVESTIGATED USING NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL METHODS ON IDENTIFIED NEURONS. THIS PROJECT RESPONDS TO SEVERAL PROGRAMMATIC OBJECTIVES OF THE NSF ORGANISMAL SYSTEMS AND INFECTION BIOLOGY (OSIB) INITIATIVE. THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS WILL PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO 1) TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF INFECTIOUS PROCESSES, 2) PARASITIC MANIPULATION OF HOST BEHAVIOR AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL NEURONS, AND 3) INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE IMMUNE AND NERVOUS SYSTEMS IN AN UNDER-STUDIED MODEL SYSTEM.

BIO-INSPIRED DESIGN INCORPORATES OUR KNOWLEDGE OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS INTO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DEVELOP TECHNICAL INVENTIONS AND INNOVATIONS. BIO-INSPIRED INNOVATION, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MATERIALS, MEDICINES, AND OTHER MATERIALS THAT BENEFIT SOCIETY, HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE BIOLOGICAL FIELD.

WHEN A BUILT STRUCTURE HAS A STEREOTYPICAL APPEARANCE, THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE STRUCTURE ITSELF SERVES A ROLE (E.G., A BIRD?S NEST MUST KEEP THE EGGS FROM ROLLING OUT). IN SOCIAL INSECTS, NESTS ARE CRITICAL FOR COLONY SURVIVAL, GROWTH, AND REPRODUCTION, AND WORKERS TYPICALLY ORGANIZE THEIR NESTS INTO DISTINCT REGIONS. IN NESTS OF THE WESTERN HONEYBEE, APIS MELLIFERA, WORKERS GENERALLY REAR BROOD IN THE CENTER OF THE NEST, AND STORE HONEY AT THE TOP. HOWEVER, BEYOND GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS OF NEST ORGANIZATION, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PATTERNS ARE INITIATED, AND PERSIST OVER COLONY DEVELOPMENT, ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. FURTHERMORE, WHILE WE ASSUME THAT NEST ORGANIZATION IS IMPORTANT FOR COLONY FUNCTION, THIS NOT BEEN EXPLICITLY TESTED. TO PERFORM THIS WORK, WE WILL DEVELOP NEW METHODS FOR ASSAYING COLONIES IN THE FIELD, AND FOR PROCESSING NEST IMAGES. UNDERSTANDING HOW HONEYBEE COLONIES NATURALLY ORGANIZE THEIR NESTS, AND THE IMPACT OF DISRUPTING THIS ORGANIZATION, IS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW SOCIAL GROUPS PARTITION SPACE. HONEYBEES ARE ALSO CRITICAL POLLINATORS IN THE MODERN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, AND MANY OF OUR BEEKEEPING TECHNIQUES EXPLICITLY DISRUPT NEST ORGANIZATION, THE IMPACTS OF THIS PRACTICE ARE SO FAR UNKNOWN. KNOWING HOW HONEYBEES NATURALLY ORGANIZE THEIR NESTS WILL HELP US TO BETTER MANAGE THIS PREMIER POLLINATOR. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO STRENGTHEN TIES AMONGST THE SOUTHEASTERN COMMUNITY OF BEEKEEPERS AND THOSE WHO RESEARCH HONEYBEES IN AN INAUGURAL CONFERENCE. IT ALSO DEVELOPS AND SHARES NEW TOOLS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON HONEYBEE COLONY STRUCTURE. SOCIAL INSECTS ARE MASTERS OF SOLVING ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY MUST COORDINATE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS TO ACCOMPLISH KEY BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVES (TO SURVIVE, GROW, AND REPRODUCE). THIS INCLUDES THE SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF RESOURCES WITHIN THE NEST, PRESUMABLY TO MAXIMIZE COLONY PERFORMANCE. WHILE GENERAL PATTERNS OF HONEYBEE NEST ORGANIZATION HAVE BEEN PRESERVED IN OVER 34 MILLION YEARS OF APIS EVOLUTION, SUGGESTING AN ADAPTIVE FUNCTION, THIS HYPOTHESIS HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED. INDEED, EVEN IN THE HONEYBEE (APIS MELLIFERA), OUR PREMIER AGRICULTURAL POLLINATOR, WE LACK A 3-DIMENSIONAL DESCRIPTION OF NEST ORGANIZATION OVER A COLONY?S LIFE. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HONEYBEE NESTS ARE ORGANIZED, AND HOW DISRUPTING NEST ORGANIZATION IMPACTS COLONY FUNCTION. IN AIM 1, WE WILL PERFORM THE FIRST-EVER 3-DIMENSIONAL DESCRIPTION OF HONEYBEE COLONY GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT, AND REPRODUCTION OVER TIME. IN AIM 2, WE WILL TEST THE IMPACT OF EXPERIMENTALLY DISRUPTING 3-DIMENSIONAL NEST ORGANIZATION, TO UNDERSTAND HOW NEST ORGANIZATION CONTRIBUTES TO COLONY FUNCTION. IN AIM 3, WE WILL TEST POTENTIAL MECHANISMS FOR HOW WORKERS GENERATE AND MAINTAIN PATTERNS OF NEST ORGANIZATION AT DIFFERENT SCALES (WHOLE-NEST; PER-COMB; PER-CELL). TO SUPPORT THESE AIMS, WE WILL DEVELOP TWO METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS: (1) A FIELD-READY PHOTOGRAPHY RIG, AND (2) AN AUTOMATED CLASSIFIER OF COMB CONTENTS. TOGETHER, THIS PROPOSAL HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR BIOLOGICAL PATTERNING, DECENTRALIZED ARCHITECTURE, AND MAY CHALLENGE (OR REINFORCE) THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION THAT FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION.

THE SHARED-USE ELECTRON MICROSCOPY FACILITY IN THE CENTER FOR ADVANCED MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION IN OREGON (CAMCOR) SERVES AS A REGIONAL RESOURCE FOR RESEARCHERS INTERESTED IN ANALYZING THE STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF A VARIETY OF NATURAL AND ENGINEERED MATERIALS AND DEVICES. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR IMAGING AND MEASURING THE ATOMIC STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF MATERIALS, BUT SOME MATERIALS ARE QUICKLY DAMAGED BY EXPOSURE TO AN ELECTRON BEAM. FURTHERMORE, MANY STRUCTURES AND PROCESSES ARE DIFFICULT TO IMAGE USING CONVENTIONAL CAMERAS BECAUSE OF LOW CONTRAST. THE HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND SPEED OF THIS NEW CAMERA DELIVERS LARGE IMPROVEMENTS IN IMAGE DETAIL AND CONTRAST, ENABLING IMAGING OF DOSE-SENSITIVE SAMPLES AND PROVIDING VIDEOS OF FAST PROCESSES AT THE NANOMETER SCALE, ALL OF WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF ADVANCED MATERIALS. AS PART OF AN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTING NUMEROUS OUTREACH AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, THE DIRECT ELECTRON DETECTOR IS ALSO USED FOR AN ARRAY OF CURRICULUM AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR USERS ACROSS AGE, DISCIPLINES, AND ACADEMIC STAGES ACROSS THE NORTHWEST. UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE, AND POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS OBTAIN HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE LEARNING TRANSFERRABLE SKILLS IN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE OPERATION AND ANALYSIS, AND IN THE GENERATION, HANDLING, AND PROCESSING OF LARGE IMAGE DATASETS. THIS DETECTOR STRENGTHENS AN EXISTING SUMMER RESEARCH COURSE DESIGNED TO ENGAGE UNDERGRADUATES IN NANOSCIENCE AND PHYSICS RESEARCH. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: THE NATIVE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT ELECTRON DETECTOR TO RECORD HIGH-RESOLUTION ELECTRON IMAGES AT RAPID SPEEDS IS APPLIED TO OBSERVATIONS OF LOW-CONTRAST DYNAMIC PROCESSES, SUCH AS OXIDATION CATALYSIS IN A LIQUID CELL SAMPLE HOLDER FOR A TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE, THE EVOLVING CATHODE MATERIAL STRUCTURE THROUGHOUT CHARGE/DISCHARGE CYCLES IN LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES, AND CRYSTALLIZATION KINETICS OF MATERIALS AT THE NANOSCALE.

THIS PROJECT WILL TARGET APPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ICE SHEETS, SEA ICE, AND SNOW COVER. THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THIS WORK INCLUDE INCREASING SCIENTIFIC ACCESS TO UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS WITH SUFFICIENT RANGE AND PAYLOAD CAPABILITIES TO CONDUCT GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS. THE FLEXIBILITY AND SMALL SIZE OF THE RADAR SYSTEM MAKE ITS INTEGRATION ON A VARIETY OF MEDIUM UNMANNED AIRCRAFT POSSIBLE, ALLOWING OUR PURSUIT OF OTHER COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE POLAR SCIENCE COMMUNITY AND BEYOND. AIRBORNE ICE-PENETRATING RADAR ARE A CRITICAL TOOL IN COLLECTING ICE THICKNESS AND BASAL TOPOGRAPHY DATA. WHILE SEVERAL LARGE-SCALE AIRBORNE SURVEYS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, MANY REGIONS OF THE MAJOR ICE SHEETS OF GREENLAND AND MORE SPECIFICALLY ANTARCTICA HAVE NOT BEEN SURVEYED DUE TO THEIR LARGE EXTENT AND REMOTE LOCATIONS. SEVERAL RECENT HIGH-PROFILE PAPERS CONTINUE TO POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ICE THICKNESS DATA AND ITS GRADIENT AT THE GROUNDING LINE FOR IMPROVING FUTURE SEA-LEVEL RISE PREDICTIONS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL ADDRESS THE CONTINUED CALL FOR POLAR ICE AND SNOW MEASUREMENTS.

A MAGNETOMETER IS AN INSTRUMENT THAT ALLOWS ONE TO CHARACTERIZE MAGNETIC MATERIAL, FOR EXAMPLE THE MAGNETS THAT STICK TO YOUR REFRIGERATOR DOOR. TO FULLY CHARACTERIZE MAGNETIC MATERIALS, IT IS NECESSARY TO MEASURE ALL THREE COMPONENTS OF THE MAGNETIC DIPOLE MOMENT VECTOR. TRIAXIAL VSMS HOWEVER ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AND LESS THAN A HANDFUL OF RESEARCH LABS IN EUROPE, JAPAN AND RUSSIA HAVE ATTEMPTED IN THE PAST TO BUILD A TRIAXIAL VSM. THE INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS FOR TRIAXIAL MEASUREMENTS TO BE DONE OVER A LARGE TEMPERATURE AND FIELD RANGE. THE VECTOR COIL SETS THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF ANISOTROPIC MATERIALS THAT HAVE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES THAT VARY WITH FIELD DIRECTION. THE NEW TOOLS ARE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN EXISTING RESEARCH AND LEAD TO NEW COLLABORATIONS AMONG ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY AND WILL BRING FULL VECTOR MAGNETOMETRY AND TORQUE CAPABILITIES TO THE AMERICAS. CONCRETE PLANS ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO INTEGRATE THE NEW TOOL IN SEVERAL GRADUATE COURSES IN PHYSICS, MSEC, AND MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING EACH YEAR AND USE THE INSTRUMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AND APPRENTICE SUMMER RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. THE INSTRUMENTATION DEVELOPMENT WILL BE DONE BY A GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE IMPACT IS MUCH LARGER THOUGH ONCE THE TOOL IS REALIZED AND TESTED WITH MULTIPLE GRADUATE PROJECTS AT TEXAS STATE AND ELSEWHERE BENEFITING FROM THIS UNIQUE CAPABILITY. THIS INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT AWARD IS TO DEVELOP TRIAXIAL VIBRATING SAMPLE MAGNETOMETRY (VSM) TO MEASURE ALL THREE COMPONENTS OF THE SAMPLE?S MAGNETIC DIPOLE MOMENT SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ALLOW FOR VECTOR TORQUE MAGNETOMETRY AS A FUNCTION OF TEMPERATURE. RATHER THAN DESIGNING A COMPLETELY NEW INSTRUMENT, THE RESEARCHER WILL DESIGN AND REALIZE TRIAXIAL COIL SETS FOR TWO EXISTING VSMS. THE APPROACH ALLOWS FOR A SHORT RUNWAY, INCREASES THE ADOPTABILITY OF THE NEW MEASUREMENT TOOL BENEFITTING FROM THE EXISTING USER POOL FOR BOTH TOOLS, AND RESULTS IN A LARGE MEASUREMENT PARAMETER WINDOW (0-9 TESLA, 2.8-1000 K). THE METHOD WILL BE USEFUL FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS. THE PROJECT WILL DIRECTLY ENHANCE THE RESEARCH IN 5 DIFFERENT ACADEMIC PROGRAMS (PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, AND MSEC). THE REALIZED VECTOR TORQUE MAGNETOMETER WILL ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO STUDY MATERIALS THAT HAVE A COMPLEX MAGNETIC ANISOTROPY ENERGY SURFACE WITH MULTIPLE ANISOTROPIES ORIGINATING FROM SHAPE, STRAIN, SURFACE, STEP, FLOW, AND A MAGNETIC FIELD APPLIED DURING DEPOSITION.

MANY METALS ARE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS FOR LIFE THAT OFTEN LIMIT BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, WHILE OTHERS ARE HARMFUL CONTAMINANTS FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES. THE BIOLOGICAL UPTAKE, TOXICITY, TRANSPORT, AND TREATMENT OF METALS IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY MOLECULES PRODUCED BY MICROBES AND PLANTS THAT BIND TO THESE METALS AND KEEP THEM IN SOLUTION. WHILE IT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED THAT MANY DISSOLVED METALS ARE MOSTLY PRESENT AS ORGANIC-BOUND FORMS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, DETERMINING THE COMPOSITION, ORIGIN, AND FATE OF METAL-BINDING ORGANIC MOLECULES IS AN ANALYTICAL CHALLENGE DUE TO THE HIGHLY COMPLEX CHEMISTRY OF ENVIRONMENTAL WATERS. THE INVESTIGATORS IN THIS STUDY WILL ACQUIRE A LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY MASS SPECTROMETRY INSTRUMENT TO ENABLE NEW RESEARCH ON THE ORIGIN AND FATE OF ORGANIC MOLECULES THAT GOVERN METAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE OCEAN, PATHWAYS FOR THE MICROBIAL PROCESSING OF METALS, THE REACTIONS BETWEEN METALS AND ORGANIC MATTER IN SOILS, THE DESIGN OF IMPROVED WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS THAT REMOVE HARMFUL METALS ASSOCIATED WITH ORGANIC MATTER, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS. THE INSTRUMENT WILL ALSO PROVIDE HANDS-ON TRAINING OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSTS THROUGH WORKSHOPS AND PROJECTS INVOLVING HIGH SCHOOL, UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE, AND POSTDOCTORAL STUDENTS. LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF IRON AND OTHER MICRONUTRIENT METALS LIMIT PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS LARGE SECTIONS OF THE OCEAN, BUT THEIR CHEMICAL FORMS ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. THIS HIGH RESOLVING POWER MASS SPECTROMETRY SYSTEM WILL BE USED TO SEPARATE AND IDENTIFY ORGANIC MOLECULES AND THEIR ISOTOPOLOGUES ENCOUNTERED IN OCEAN WATERS. AS PART OF THE US GEOTRACES PROGRAM, WE WILL MEASURE TRACE METAL AND ORGANIC SPECIATION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN OCEAN AND ANTARCTIC SHELF. THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE MECHANISTIC INSIGHT INTO THE PROCESSES THAT SUPPLY MICRONUTRIENTS TO SURFACE WATERS OF THE CHRONICALLY METAL LIMITED SOUTHERN OCEAN. WE WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE SPECIATION OF METALS AND ORGANICS SOURCED FROM COASTAL SEDIMENTS, GROUNDWATER AND MICROBIAL LABORATORY CULTURES TO ESTABLISH LINKAGES BETWEEN SPECIFIC ORGANISMS/GENES AND METAL BINDING METABOLITES THAT GOVERN METAL SOLUBILITY AND UPTAKE ACROSS DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS. FURTHERMORE, WE WILL DETERMINE SPECIATION OF COPPER AND OTHER ANTHROPOGENIC METALS IN RIVER AND WASTEWATERS IN ORDER TO ASSESS TOXICITY AND REMOVAL STRATEGIES.

MOREOVER, THESE INVESTIGATORS ARE ALSO WELL POSITIONED TO FACILITATE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THESE MATERIALS TOWARD APPLICATIONS IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. THIS PROJECT DEVELOPS A HIGH-PRESSURE LASER FLOATING ZONE FURNACE, NOT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, CAPABLE OF GROWING SINGLE CRYSTALS OF NOVEL MATERIALS THAT CANNOT BE GROWN ANY OTHER WAY. THE HIGH-PRESSURE LASER FLOATING ZONE FURNACE WILL BE A PART OF RICE?S SHARED EQUIPMENT AUTHORITY AND THEREFORE HAVE A BROAD USER BASE FROM RICE UNIVERSITY AND THE EXTENDED RESEARCH COMMUNITY IN AND AROUND HOUSTON, TEXAS. IN ADDITION TO TRAINING UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE ART OF GROWING SINGLE CRYSTALS USING THE FURNACE, THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THIS PROJECT WILL OPEN AREAS OF RESEARCH CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR FACULTY AND STUDENTS. THESE ACTIVITIES WILL BROADEN THE AVENUES OF RESEARCH IN SOLID-STATE SCIENCE AND WILL PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISCOVERIES OF NOVEL PHENOMENA IN SINGLE CRYSTALS OF QUANTUM MATERIALS. CONVENTIONAL LASER FLOATING ZONE FURNACES ARE POWERFUL TOOLS USED TO GROW HIGH-QUALITY SINGLE CRYSTALS OF OXIDES, INTERMETALLICS, CARBIDES, AND SILICIDES, AS LONG AS THE MELTING TEMPERATURE IS BELOW ~2,800?C, BUT THE GROWTH CHAMBER IS LIMITED UP TO 300 BAR GAS PRESSURE. GROWING SINGLE CRYSTALS OF MORE COMPLEX MATERIALS, HOWEVER, REQUIRES SPECIAL CAPABILITIES, PARTICULARLY THE USE OF HIGH PRESSURE IN THE GROWTH CHAMBER. THIS IS BECAUSE THE BOILING POINT OF A LIQUID IS THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH ITS VAPOR PRESSURE IS EQUAL TO THE PRESSURE OF THE GAS AROUND IT. INCREASING THE GAS PRESSURE TO 1000 BAR INSIDE THE CHAMBER WILL DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO STABILIZE THE MELT, AND THEREFORE ALLOWING GROWTH OF SINGLE CRYSTALS NOT POSSIBLE WITH CONVENTIONAL LASER FLOATING ZONE FURNACE. RECENTLY, THE INVESTIGATOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA BARBARA (UCSB), DEVELOPED A NOVEL DESIGN FOR A HIGH-PRESSURE LASER FLOATING ZONE FURNACE FOR OPERATIONAL PRESSURES UP TO 1000 BARS OF GAS PRESSURE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CONTINUE THIS INNOVATION THROUGH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A NEXT-GENERATION HIGH-PRESSURE LASER FLOATING ZONE FURNACE AT RICE UNIVERSITY; IT WILL BE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN TEXAS AND THE SOUTHERN U.S. AND WILL REPRESENT A CONTINUED ADVANCE IN HIGH-PRESSURE FLOATING ZONE TECHNOLOGY FOR ADVANCED CRYSTAL GROWTH.

SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY (SIMS) IS A POWERFUL MICRO-ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE FOR DETERMINING THE ELEMENTAL AND ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS OF SOLID MATERIALS THAT HAS BROAD APPLICATIONS TO EARTH, OCEAN, AND PLANETARY SCIENCES. THE NENIMF HAS OPERATED AS A HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE, NSF-SUPPORTED NATIONAL FACILITY FOR TWENTY-SIX YEARS AND IS EQUIPPED WITH INSTRUMENTATION AND PERSONNEL THAT ARE IDEALLY SUITED TO HELP THE GEOSCIENCE COMMUNITY TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF MULTI-COLLECTOR SIMS. AN IMS 1280 UPGRADED WITH MULTI-COLLECTION CAPABILITY WOULD COMPLETE THE NENIMF AS A CUTTING-EDGE SIMS FACILITY SERVING THE US GEOSCIENCE COMMUNITY FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST OF PURCHASING A NEW CAMECA IMS 1300-HR3 (~$7 MILLION). THE MONO-COLLECTION NENIMF IMS 1280 HAS ESTABLISHED AN IMPORTANT NICHE IN THE GEOSCIENCE COMMUNITY AS A MAJOR SOURCE OF HIGH-QUALITY DATA ON VOLATILE ELEMENT CONCENTRATIONS IN SILICATE GLASSES, GLASS INCLUSIONS, AND NOMINALLY ANHYDROUS MINERALS. THE UPGRADE TO MULTI-COLLECTION WILL BE LEVERAGED BY COMBINING THIS EXISTING EXPERTISE WITH THE CAPABILITY TO ANALYZE LIGHT STABLE ISOTOPES ON THE SAME SPOTS AND, THEREBY, ALLOW US TO PROVIDE EXCITING AND INNOVATIVE NEW SIMS APPLICATIONS FOR USERS OF THE FACILITY. THE PROPOSED UPGRADE WOULD GREATLY ENHANCE STUDIES OF PRE-ERUPTIVE MAGMATIC VOLATILES, WHICH REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT CONTROL ON VOLCANO EXPLOSIVITY, AS WELL AS VOLATILES (ESPECIALLY SULFUR) IN THE SOLID EARTH, COSMOCHEMISTRY, OXYGEN ISOTOPE THERMOMETRY, BIOGENIC CARBONATES, AND BIOGEOCHEMISTRY. THE CAMECA IMS 1280 IS A DOUBLE FOCUSING MASS SPECTROMETER WITH A LARGE RADIUS MAGNETIC SECTOR, AND ION OPTICS OPTIMIZED TO ATTAIN A MASS RESOLVING POWER OF 6000 WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SECONDARY ION INTENSITY. STARTING IN 1998, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF IMS 1270/1280 ION MICROPROBES HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH THE CAPABILITY TO MEASURE UP TO FIVE ISOTOPES SIMULTANEOUSLY (MULTI-COLLECTION). MULTI-COLLECTION HAS A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OVER MONO-COLLECTION. FIRST, IT INCREASES THE EFFICIENCY OF DATA COLLECTION AND ? THEREBY ? MINIMIZES THE EFFECT OF INSTRUMENTAL DRIFT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TIME REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF S IN SULFIDES OR O IN SILICATES IS DECREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY 12 MINUTES PER SPOT USING MONO-COLLECTION TO ONLY 4 MINUTES PER SPOT BY MULTI-COLLECTION. THIS LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCURACY AND REPRODUCIBILITY BECAUSE INSTRUMENTAL DRIFT CAN BE CORRECTED FOR THROUGH A MUCH HIGHER FREQUENCY OF STANDARD ANALYSES BETWEEN SAMPLES. SECOND, THE ABILITY TO MEASURE MULTIPLE ISOTOPES SIMULTANEOUSLY LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DATA QUALITY BY MINIMIZING THE EFFECTS OF INSTABILITY AND DRIFT OF THE PRIMARY ION BEAM. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 32S/34S MEASUREMENTS ON SULFIDE STANDARDS ON THE NENIMF MONO-COLLECTION SYSTEM HAVE A TYPICAL PRECISION OF 0.07-0.12 ? 2RSE (RELATIVE STANDARD ERROR) AND A SPOT TO SPOT REPRODUCIBILITY (ACCURACY) OF ~0.6 ? 2RSD (RELATIVE STANDARD DEVIATION). MULTI-COLLECTOR ANALYSIS ON THE SAME STANDARDS HAVE A PRECISION OF 0.02-0.03 ? 2RSE AND ACCURACY < 0.1 ? 2RSD. THIRD ? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ?

THE DTXRD COMBINES TWO INDEPENDENT AND SIMULTANEOUSLY OPERABLE SYSTEMS TO ENABLE: (I) X-RAY DIFFRACTION MEASUREMENTS WITH COPPER (CU) OR MOLYBDENUM (MO) RADIATION IN TRANSMISSION GEOMETRY (MAXIMIZING DATA QUALITY, ESPECIALLY FOR LAYERED AND 2D MATERIALS) THAT CAN BE PERFORMED IN CAPILLARIES (IDEAL FOR AIR-SENSITIVE COMPOUNDS) AND IN AN AUTOMATED WAY (UP TO 30 SAMPLES), AND (II) TOTAL SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS AND PAIR DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION ANALYSIS USING HIGH ENERGY (SILVER (AG) RADIATION) FOR LOCAL STRUCTURE INFORMATION OF CRYSTALLINE AS WELL AS LOW- AND NON-CRYSTALLINE SPECIES, INCLUDING A REACTION CHAMBER AND VARIABLE TEMPERATURE CAPABILITIES (40 - 1,800 K AND GAS ATMOSPHERE). THE HIGH ENERGY RADIATION ALSO ENABLES OPERANDO TRANSMISSION DIFFRACTION MEASUREMENTS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICES WITH COIN AND POUCH CELL HOLDERS. THE DTXRD IS USED FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THREE GENERAL AREAS: (1) UNDERSTANDING THE LOCAL STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPING NEW SYNTHETIC REACTION PATHWAYS FOR LAYERED, LOW CRYSTALLINE, NON-CRYSTALLINE OR AMORPHOUS, AND LOW-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS; (2) MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF MATERIALS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY/CATALYSIS APPLICATIONS; (3) DISCOVERY OF NEW QUANTUM PHASES IN QUANTUM SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING. THE OVERARCHING GOAL WITHIN THESE BROAD RESEARCH FIELDS IS TO DEVELOP A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE OF DIVERSE SPECIES (RANGING FROM SOLID-STATE BATTERY AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS TO MINERALS AND ORGANICS/POLYMERS), THEIR FORMATION MECHANISMS, AND THEIR BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL STIMULI (INCLUDING THEIR POTENTIAL DEGRADATION AND FAILURE). THIS KNOWLEDGE IS CRUCIAL FOR THE UNDERSTANDING AND DESIGN OF NEXT GENERATION MATERIALS FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY, SEMICONDUCTOR, CATALYSIS, AND QUANTUM COMPUTING APPLICATIONS.

GROUP III-NITRIDES ARE SEMICONDUCTORS BEYOND SILICON THAT ENABLE UNIQUE ELECTRONIC AND OPTICAL DEVICES FOR POWER CHARGERS FOR LAPTOPS, CELL PHONES AND OTHER CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND THE ELECTRONICS FOR HYBRID AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES (HEV?S). THESE SEMICONDUCTORS ARE ALSO USED TO MANUFACTURE THE GREEN, BLUE, AND WHITE LIGHT EMITTING DIODES (LED?S) FOR HIGH EFFICIENCY LIGHTING AND DISPLAYS FOR WHICH THE 2014 NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS WAS AWARDED. THE III-NITRIDE SEMICONDUCTORS ARE ALSO AT THE CORE OF ULTRAVIOLET LEDS FOR DISINFECTION AND AIR-WATER PURIFICATION. THESE UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT SEMICONDUCTORS MATERIALS ARE PRODUCED USING A HIGH TEMPERATURE GROWTH PROCESS CALLED METALORGANIC CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (MOCVD) THAT IS CARRIED OUT IN A UNIQUE HIGH TEMPERATURE EQUIPMENT TO ALLOW HIGH QUALITY CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS WITH A VERY HIGH PURITY. IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT THE INCORPORATION OF TRANSITION METALS, SUCH AS TITANIUM AND SCANDIUM CAN ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS FOR POWER ELECTRONICS BY INCREASING THE PIEZOELECTRICALLY PRODUCED ELECTRICAL CHARGE BY ~2-10 TIMES. THIS HIGHER CHARGE CAN WILL ENABLE HIGHER CURRENT LEVELS IN HEV?S. THE CHALLENGE HERE IS TO PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS, WHICH IN TURN REQUIRE EVEN HIGHER TEMPERATURE GROWTH AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES, FOR WHICH THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO COMMERCIAL TOOLS AVAILABLE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL DEVELOP BOTH THE HARDWARE TOOLS, AND THE CHEMICAL PROCESSES, AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS NEW HIGH TEMPERATURE, HIGH CURRENT, HIGH VOLTAGE TECHNOLOGY. THIS TRACK-I NSF MRI PROPOSAL AIMS TO DEVELOP A NEW HIGH TEMPERATURE SOURCE-METALORGANIC CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION SYSTEM (HTS-MOCVD) FOR DEPOSITING THE EMERGING IIIB-TRANSITION- METAL NITRIDES (SUCH AS SCN), AND CONVENTIONAL IIIA-NITRIDES (GAN-ALN-INN) IN A SINGLE GROWTH REACTOR. THE III-B NITRIDES HAVE VERY HIGH PIEZO-PYROELECTRIC COEFFICIENTS MAKING THEM IDEAL FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE SENSORS. MOREOVER, THEIR HETEROJUNCTIONS WITH III-A NITRIDES CAN POTENTIALLY YIELD POWER ELECTRONIC AND UVB-C OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICES WITH PERFORMANCE LEVEL WELL ABOVE THOSE OF CURRENT DEVICES. OUR SYSTEM DESIGN WILL HAVE SEVERAL INNOVATIVE FEATURES SUCH AS A NEW HIGH TEMPERATURE SOURCE DESIGN, AND A NEW PRECURSOR INJECTOR DESIGN. THIS NEW INJECTOR DESIGN WILL IN ESSENCE ALLOW SOURCE INJECTION LIKE IN CONVENTIONAL MOCVD REACTORS VERY CLOSE TO THE GROWTH SUSCEPTOR. THIS NCLOSE INJECTION MODE, AND THE HIGH TEMPERATURE SOURCE, WILL ENABLE INCREASED PRECURSOR INJECTION EFFICIENCY AND THUS GROWTH RATES FOR SCN COMPATIBLE WITH THOSE OF ALXGA1-XN. THE CLOSE TO SUSCEPTOR/SUBSTRATE INJECTION WILL ALSO LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE ADDUCT FORMATION THEREBY SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVING THE GROWTH QUALITY WITH A GROWTH RATE MUCH HIGHER THAN CONVENTIONAL MOCVD SYSTEMS. THUS, OUR UNIQUE SYSTEM DESIGN WILL ALLOW THE GROWTH OF THICKER BUFFER REGIONS AND THE ACTIVE REGIONS (TYPICALLY MUCH THINNER) OF THE DEVICE STRUCTURES SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE SAME SYSTEM. IT WILL ALSO BE IDEAL FOR DEPOSITING ALXGA1-XN/ALYSC1-YN HETEROJUNCTIONS AND QUANTUM WELLS TO EXPLORE THEIR PROPERTIES.

BUILT WITH A ROBUST AND RELIABLE FIBER-LASER BACKBONE, THIS LIGHT SOURCE WILL PROVIDE PHASE-COHERENT FEMTOSECOND-DURATION LIGHT PULSES AT MHZ REPETITION RATES THAT WILL BE USED IN A VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTS. THE LIGHT SOURCE DEVELOPMENT WORK PROPOSED HERE WILL QUANTITATIVELY ADVANCE THE STATE OF THE ART IN FREQUENCY COMBS, AND ULTRAFAST OPTICS IN GENERAL, IN A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT WAYS. FOR ONE EXAMPLE, THE PIS WILL PRODUCE THE BRIGHTEST SOURCE OF BROADBAND COHERENT THZ AND FAR-INFRARED RADIATION, ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BRIGHTER THAN DEDICATED INFRARED/THZ BEAMLINES AT SYNCHROTRON LIGHT SOURCES. SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS ADVANCES IN LIGHT SOURCE TECHNOLOGY, THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL HAVE A LARGE QUALITATIVE IMPACT ON A WIDE RANGE OF SCIENCE, WITH MANY APPLICATIONS BOTH FORESEEN AND UNFORESEEN.

THE INSTRUMENT IS USED IN FOUR MAJOR RESEARCH AREAS: PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, AND CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING. (1) INTERFACE MORPHOLOGY IN MULTILAYER ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTOR FILMS IS INVESTIGATED FOR BASIC RESEARCH IN OPTOELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS IN AN ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTOR PHYSICS LAB. SEM IMAGING REVEALS THE INTERFACIAL CONTACT PROPERTIES OF FILMS OF PERYLENE DIIMIDE DERIVATIVES ON INORGANIC INDIUM TIN OXIDE SUBSTRATES. (2) HYDROCHARS FROM HYDROTHERMAL CONVERSION OF CONTAMINATED REEDS ARE ACTIVATED AS SUPPORTS OF PD-NI/CU BIMETALLIC CATALYSTS FOR SELECTIVE HYDROGENATION OF ALKYNES TO ALKENES WHICH ARE INTERMEDIATES TO MANUFACTURE CRITICAL CHEMICALS/MEDICINE. SEM IS USED TO RELATE THE SURFACE PROPERTIES OF HYDROCHARS TO THE ACTIVITY, SELECTIVITY, AND STABILITY OF HYDROGENATION REACTIONS. (3) BIOMASS QUALITY FOR PYROLYTIC CONVERSION IS DETERMINED BY TOTAL CELLULAR LIPID CONTENT. PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY UPGRADE COUPLED WITH CARBON/NITROGEN BALANCE DISRUPTION IS A MAJOR STRATEGY FOR AN EFFECTIVE PHOTOSYNTHETIC BIOMASS PRODUCTION; WITH A CONCEPTUAL BASIS OF LIPID STORAGE BEING AN INTRACELLULAR CARBON AND ENERGY. SEM IMAGING PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT INNOVATIVE MECHANISM OF MONITORING CELLULAR CONTENTS AND COMPOSITION CHANGES OF STORAGE MOLECULES. (4) THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF CONCRETE WITH CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS IS STUDIED BY SEM IMAGING. FRACTURE SURFACES ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE MODE AND MECHANISM OF FAILURE OF CONCRETE WITH DIFFERENT COMPONENTS SUCH AS FLY ASHES, SLAG CEMENT, SILICA FUME, RUBBER, FIBERS, AND RECYCLED AGGREGATES. THE SEM ALSO YIELDS COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION VIA ITS EDS CAPABILITY, ENABLING SUB-MICROMETER INVESTIGATION OF THE MATERIAL?S STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION.

THESE MATERIALS EXHIBIT PROPERTIES THAT ARE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT FROM SUBSTANCES AT LARGER LENGTH SCALES AND ARE ESSENTIAL TO ADVANCE A WIDE ARRAY OF TECHNOLOGIES, RANGING FROM MAGNETIC DATA-STORAGE SYSTEMS TO SUPERCONDUCTING QUANTUM COMPUTERS TO BIOMATERIALS APPLICATIONS. TO STUDY AND IMPROVE UPON THESE MATERIALS, TOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO EXAMINE THEM AT THE ATOMIC LEVEL WHILE MINIMIZING ANY DISTURBANCE TO THEIR STRUCTURE. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, WHICH USES ELECTRONS TO SEE ATOMS, IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL MEANS BY WHICH THE STRUCTURES OF SUCH NANOSCALE MATERIALS CAN BE STUDIED. CURRENT DESIGNS OF HIGH-RESOLUTION TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPES REQUIRE A LENS TO FOCUS THE ELECTRON BEAM ON THE SAMPLE SURFACE. A SIDE EFFECT OF THIS DESIGN IS THAT THE SAMPLE MATERIAL IS INADVERTENTLY EXPOSED TO A HIGH MAGNETIC FIELD. YET, TURNING THE LENS OFF TO ELIMINATE THE MAGNETIC FIELD WHEN STUDYING MAGNETIC OR SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS MAKES ATOMIC-RESOLUTION ANALYSIS IMPOSSIBLE. THE INSTRUMENT ACQUIRED THROUGH THIS MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION GRANT HAS A NEW LENS DESIGN, PROVIDING A MAGNETIC-FIELD-FREE SAMPLE REGION AND, WHEN COMBINED WITH A NEARLY MONO-ENERGETIC ELECTRON SOURCE, ALLOWS FOR ATOMIC-RESOLUTION IMAGING AS WELL AS CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THESE CRITICAL MATERIALS. IN ADDITION, ATOMIC RESOLUTION, MAGNETIC-FIELD-FREE ANALYSIS CAN NOW ALSO BE ACHIEVED DURING HEATING OR COOLING EXPERIMENTS OR WHEN A CONTROLLED MAGNETIC FIELD IS APPLIED. TO REACH A BROADER USER COMMUNITY AND FOR COMMUNICATING THE CAPABILITIES OF THE INSTRUMENT, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS HOLD ANNUAL WORKSHOPS, ORGANIZE SESSIONS AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES, AND ENGAGE WITH LOCAL MICROSCOPY SOCIETIES. THE INSTRUMENT, MOREOVER, PROVIDES THE DIVERSE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENT BODY AT UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS - CHICAGO (UIC), A RESEARCH-1 HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTION WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR HANDS-ON RESEARCH AND LEARNING EXPERIENCES IN CUTTING-EDGE QUANTUM, SUPERCONDUCTING OR BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE. NEW IN-CLASS COURSE MODULES AND ONLINE TEACHING RESOURCES ARE DEVELOPED AND FREELY DISTRIBUTED ONLINE USING DATA FROM THE FIELD-FREE TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: WHILE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ABERRATION-CORRECTORS, MONOCHROMATED ELECTRON SOURCES, AND ADVANCED DETECTORS HAS FUELED THE CURRENT REVOLUTION IN RESOLUTION, NEARLY ALL HIGH-RESOLUTION TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (TEM) EXPERIMENTS ARE STILL PERFORMED WITH THE SAMPLE BEING EXPOSED TO A HIGH MAGNETIC FIELD, SINCE THE OBJECTIVE LENS (OL) POLE-PIECES REQUIRE A MAGNETIC FIELD OF ABOUT 3 TESLA. SUCH A MAGNETIC FIELD LIMITS THE SAMPLES THAT CAN BE STUDIED, PREVENTING MAGNETIC, MAGNETO-OPTICAL, MAGNETO-ELECTRIC, SUPERCONDUCTIVE OR TOPOLOGICAL MATERIALS FROM BEING CHARACTERIZED UNDER RELEVANT CONDITIONS. TRADITIONAL MAGNETIC IMAGING METHODS, WHERE THE OL IS TURNED OFF, LIMIT THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION TO NANOMETER LENGTH-SCALES AND DO NOT ALLOW FOR ATOMIC-RESOLUTION CHEMICAL ANALYSIS. THIS INSTRUMENT HAS A NOVEL LENS DESIGN THAT ALLOWS FOR BETTER THAN 100 PM SPATIAL RESOLUTION AT 200 KV WITH A RESIDUAL MAGNETIC FIELD OF LESS THAN 0.3 MT AND 40 MEV ENERGY RESOLUTION WITH A PROBE SIZE OF 110 NM. ATOMIC-RESOLUTION CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS NOVEL IMAGE MODES, SUCH AS 4D-STEM AND DIFFERENTIAL PHASE CONTRAST IMAGING, CAN BE COMBINED WITH IN-SITU HEATING OR COOLING EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY MAGNETIC, SUPERCONDUCTING OR OTHER ELECTRONIC PHASE TRANSITIONS. RESEARCH PROJECTS AT UIC ENABLED BY THE NEW INSTRUMENT INCLUDE THE STUDY OF NOVEL MAGNETIC PHASES IN NI-BASED PEROVSKITE OXIDES, EXCITONS IN 2-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS, CONVENTIONAL AND NEAR-ROOM TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS, NANOPARTICLES/QUANTUM DOTS AS TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS, AND ANTI-CAVITY BIOFILMS AND THE MECHANICAL MANIPULATION OF CELLS. EXTERNAL USERS, RANGING FROM UNIVERSITIES, NATIONAL LABORATORIES AND COMPANIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES TO INTERNATIONAL PARTNER INSTITUTIONS, CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY THE INSTRUMENT TO STUDY NOVEL QUANTUM MATERIALS, NEW MAGNETIC STRUCTURES, PHOTOVOLTAIC MATERIALS, ENERGY-STORAGE DEVICES, AND BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER CONTROLLED MAGNETIC-FIELD CONDITIONS AND WITH ATOMIC RESOLUTION.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROPAGATION OF A CRACK-TIP THAT WOULD LEAD TO A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF A COMPONENT, OR DEFORMATION/TEMPERATURE-INDUCED PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS AND CRYSTALLINITY CHANGES ARE IMPORTANT PROCESSING PHENOMENA THAT CAN LEAD TO FAILURE IN MATERIALS. THE PLASMA FOCUSED ION BEAM (FIB) IN THIS PROJECT ALLOWS RESEARCHERS TO EFFICIENTLY EXTRACT SAMPLES FROM SPECIFIC SITES OF INTEREST IN MATERIALS FOR MICROMECHANICAL TESTING, WHICH CAN BE PERFORMED USING A STATE-OF-THE-ART MICROMECHANICAL TESTING DEVICE INTEGRATED WITHIN THE SAME FIB INSTRUMENT.

SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY IS USED FOR CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SURFACE LAYER OF SOLIDS WITH UP TO PART PER MILLION SENSITIVITY AND NANOMETER DEPTH RESOLUTION. IN THIS CHEMICAL ANALYSIS METHOD, AN ION BEAM IS USED TO REMOVE MATERIAL FROM THE OUTERMOST SURFACE OF THE SAMPLE. THIS BEAM IS REFERRED TO AS THE PRIMARY ION BEAM. SOME OF THE REMOVED MATERIALS LOSE ELECTRONS FORMING SECONDARY IONS THAT ESCAPE THE SURFACE OF THE STUDIED MATERIAL ALONG WITH NEUTRALS. THESE SECONDARY IONS ARE THEN ANALYZED TO FIND THEIR MASS WHICH YIELDS THE MATERIAL COMPOSITION. AN INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF SECONDARY IONS TO NEUTRALS INCREASES THE DETECTION SENSITIVITY AND RESOLUTION. CURRENT COMMERCIAL SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETERS USE SINGLY-CHARGED IONS TO REMOVE MOLECULES FROM THE SURFACE OF THE SAMPLE. IN THIS PROJECT, MULTICHARGED IONS FROM LASER ABLATION WILL BE USED AS THE PRIMARY IONS, WHICH CAN ENHANCE THE RATIO OF SECONDARY IONS TO NEUTRALS FROM THE STUDIED SAMPLE AND, CORRESPONDINGLY, INCREASE CHEMICAL DETECTION SENSITIVITY AND RESOLUTION. THE DEVELOPED INSTRUMENT WILL ENABLE THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF ULTRATHIN LAYERS USED IN NANOELECTRONICS FOR HIGH-SPEED COMPUTERS, ADVANCED ELECTRONIC DEVICES, AND SENSORS. THE INSTRUMENT WILL ALSO ENABLE FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INTERACTION OF MULTICHARGED IONS WITH MATERIALS, THEREFORE, ADVANCING THE USE OF MULTICHARGED IONS IN NANOFABRICATION. AT LEAST THREE PH.D. STUDENTS WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT, WHILE MANY FACULTY AND GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL UTILIZE THE INSTRUMENT ONCE IT IS COMMISSIONED. ALSO, OVER THE DURATION OF THE PROJECT, 20?24 OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE PROJECT AS PART OF THEIR ENGINEERING AND PHYSICS SENIOR PROJECTS, AND 2?4 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE SIMULATION OF THE ION BEAM COMPONENTS OF THE INSTRUMENTS. TECHNICAL SUMMARY THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETER (SIMS) WITH HIGHER SENSITIVITY THAN CURRENT COMMERCIAL SIMS AND ALSO WITH BETTER DEPTH RESOLUTION. THE KEY TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IS THE USE OF MULTICHARGED ION (MCI) PULSES GENERATED FROM A COMPACT LASER ION SOURCE AS THE PRIMARY BEAM. CURRENT COMMERCIAL SIMS USES SINGLY-CHARGED IONS OR CLUSTERS FOR THE PRIMARY BEAM, WHICH CAUSES SECONDARY ION EJECTION BY COLLISIONAL SPUTTERING FROM THE SURFACE OF A SAMPLE. MULTICHARGED PRIMARY IONS WITH HIGH POTENTIAL ENERGY CAUSE POTENTIAL ENERGY SPUTTERING IN ADDITION TO COLLISIONAL SPUTTERING, IN WHICH THE IONIZATION FRACTION FOR THE SECONDARY BEAM CAN BE TWO-TO-THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN FOR SINGLY-CHARGED IONS OR CLUSTERS. THE HIGHER IONIZATION FRACTION RESULTS IN A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN SIMS SENSITIVITY AND DEPTH RESOLUTION. A PULSED LASER WILL BE USED TO ABLATE BISMUTH OR GOLD TARGETS, PRODUCING AN INTENSE SOURCE OF MCIS. THESE ION PULSES WILL BE ACCELERATED AND SHORTENED TO A FEW NANOSECONDS. THEN, A SPECIFIC CHARGE WILL BE SELECTED AND INCIDENT ON THE SAMPLE TO BE ANALYZED. A TIME-OF-FLIGHT ION SPECTROMETER WILL BE BUILT TO IDENTIFY THE MASS OF THE SECONDARY IONS. THE INSTRUMENT SENSITIVITY, MASS RESOLUTION, AND DEPTH AND LATERAL RESOLUTIONS WILL BE TESTED UNDER STATIC AND DYNAMIC SIMS. THE MCI-SIMS WILL ENABLE ELEMENTAL DEPTH PROFILING OF SHALLOW-IMPLANTED DOPANTS, IDENTIFICATION OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE SURFACE REGION OF THIN FILMS AND ULTRATHIN LAYERS WITH MUCH REDUCED PRE-EQUILIBRIUM REGION AND MIXING EFFECTS, AND NANOSCALE ION IMPLANTATION FOR IMPLANTATION-BASED QUANTUM DEVICES. THE INSTRUMENT WILL ENABLE FURTHER RESEARCH ON MCI INTERACTION WITH SURFACES AND THE STUDY OF SYNERGY BETWEEN MCI-SURFACE INTERACTION AND LASER SURFACE EXCITATION. AT LEAST THREE PH.D.

MORE URGENTLY, BOTH THE NUMBER OF NON-NATIVE SPECIES AND THEIR IMPACTS ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE COMING DECADES. FOR EXAMPLE, APPROXIMATELY AN ADDITIONAL 1,500 NON-NATIVE SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO ESTABLISH IN NORTH AMERICA BY 2050. FURTHERMORE, THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ARE PREDICTED TO INCREASE THREEFOLD PER DECADE. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS, AND PRIVATE CITIZENS HAVE SPENT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF SPECIES INVASIONS, BUT THE OUTCOMES ARE FAR FROM SATISFACTORY. ONE MAIN REASON IS THAT WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A HOLISTIC AND PREDICTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF SPECIES INVASION ACROSS SCALES. THIS PROJECT WILL COMPILE AN OPEN-ACCESS, CROSS-SCALE DATABASE OF SPECIES INVASION CENTERED AROUND THE DATASETS COLLECTED BY THE NATIONAL ECOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY NETWORK (NEON).

THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE UNIQUE CUTTING-EDGE CAPABILITIES OF THE INSTRUMENT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS, NOT ONLY AT RPI BUT ALSO TO A BROADER COMMUNITY IN THE NY CAPITAL REGION AND BEYOND. A NUMBER OF LABORATORIES WILL USE THE INSTRUMENT TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS OF BASIC BIOCHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATIONS TO EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. THE INSTRUMENT WILL ALSO BE USED IN A NUMBER OF HANDS-ON WORKSHOPS THAT WILL INCLUDE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. THE PARTICIPATION IN THESE WORKSHOPS WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE LABORATORIES FROM NSF-SUPPORTED RESEARCH COORDINATION NETWORK ON EXTREME BIOPHYSICS (RCN-EB). IN ADDITION, THE RESEARCH THAT IS ENABLED BY THIS INSTRUMENT WILL BE INCORPORATED IN COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS INTO STEM FIELDS AND REACHES OUT TO TALENTED UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES AND YOUNG WOMEN IN THE NY CAPITAL REGION. HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE IS AN IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE THAT PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN BIOLOGICAL ADAPTATION FOR MANY EXTREMOPHILIC ORGANISMS THAT INHABIT THE DEPTH OF THE OCEANS AND SUBSURFACE CRUSTS. THE HPSF INSTRUMENT WILL SUPPORT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF A GROUP OF INVESTIGATORS INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR DETAILS OF THE EFFECTS OF HIGH HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE ON THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION AND FUNCTIONAL DYNAMICS OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES. THE ABILITY TO EXPERIMENTALLY MONITOR ENZYME KINETICS AS A FUNCTION OF TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE USING THE HPSF INSTRUMENT IS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE MODULATES THE ACTIVITY OF THE ENZYMES. THIS IN TURN WILL LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ADAPTATION OF ORGANISMS TO EXTREME PRESSURES. HIGH-HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE CAN ALSO INFLUENCE THE ENERGY LANDSCAPE FOR PROTEIN FOLDING. HIGH-ENERGY STATES OF PROTEINS ARE IMPLICATED IN CATALYSIS, BINDING, AGGREGATION, ALLOSTERY, AND FOLDING, THUS CONNECTING THE ENZYMATIC FUNCTION WITH THEIR DYNAMIC PROPERTIES.

LOW POPULATION DENSITIES AND SPARSE INFRASTRUCTURE IN RURAL AREAS, HOWEVER, MAKE THEM LESS ATTRACTIVE FOR INVESTMENT IN NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. FIFTH GENERATION (5G)?S SUPPORT FOR VERTICAL INDUSTRY INTEGRATION HAS FURTHER MAGNIFIED THE BROADBAND ACCESS INEQUALITIES BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL ENVIRONMENTS. TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO PROVIDE RURAL BROADBAND ACCESS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE NON-UNIFORMITY IN DEMAND FOR COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTATION RESOURCES THAT ARE FOUND THROUGHOUT THESE ENVIRONMENTS; FOR EXAMPLE, MANY AUTOMATED FARMING SERVICES WILL HAVE STRINGENT DELAY REQUIREMENTS FOR SHORT PERIODS DURING THE DAY WHILE RESIDENTIAL AREAS EXHIBIT TRADITIONAL DIURNAL PATTERNS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE BY ESTABLISHING A CORE SET OF METHODOLOGIES THAT SYNERGIZE THE DESIGN OF RURAL CONNECTIVITY AND COMPUTING. EMERGING MASSIVE MULTIPLE-INPUT MULTIPLE-OUTPUT (MIMO) TECHNOLOGY IS INTEGRATED WITH THE DESIGN OF HIERARCHICAL DATA PROCESSING ARCHITECTURES ACROSS THE RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADAPT BASED ON SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DEMAND VARIATIONS. EXTENSIVE EVALUATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BASED ON A MASSIVE MIMO PLATFORM AND WIRELESS DEVICE EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE FROM THE INDUSTRIAL PARTNER. THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DIVERSE WORKFORCE IN RURAL BROADBAND AND INTELLIGENCE THROUGH THE FORMATION OF RESEARCH TEAMS INTEGRATING UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS ACROSS INSTITUTIONS. PROJECT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED INTO THREE THRUSTS. THRUST 1 DEVELOPS AGILE COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES UNDER NON-UNIFORM RURAL SETTINGS, ADDRESSING THE NEEDS FOR MULTI-USER MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR MASSIVE MIMO INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS INCLUDES THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL NETWORK CONTROL ALGORITHMS WITH SCHEDULING POLICIES THAT ARE CUSTOMIZED FOR HETEROGENEOUS RURAL CONNECTIVITY NEEDS. THE DEVELOPED ALGORITHMS ARE FURTHER ENHANCED BY REDUCING SCHEDULING OVERHEAD THROUGH POSITION-AIDED CHANNEL REPRESENTATION TECHNIQUES. THRUST 2 INVESTIGATES THE ORCHESTRATION OF COMPUTATION TASKS UNDER RURAL NON-UNIFORMITY, FOCUSING ON ESTABLISHING INTELLIGENT RURAL DATA PROCESSING ARCHITECTURES LEVERAGING THE BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY PROVIDED BY THRUST 1. TECHNIQUES FOR DISTRIBUTING DATA PROCESSING AMONG CLUSTERS OF RURAL DEVICES AIMING TO EXECUTE COLLABORATIVE TASKS RAPIDLY ARE DEVELOPED VIA JOINT OPTIMIZATION OF DEVICE-TO-DEVICE COMMUNICATIONS AND TASK UTILITY METRICS. THE ORCHESTRATION OF DATA PROCESSING AND INTELLIGENCE SYNCHRONIZATION STEPS ALONG THE RURAL NETWORK HIERARCHY IS ALSO CONSIDERED TO ADAPT BASED ON TASK DEMAND VARIATIONS.

UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE BARRIERS FORM IS A LONGSTANDING CHALLENGE IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. THIS IS BECAUSE RECURRENT MIGRATION IS EXPECTED TO ERASE ANY EMERGING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATIONS. ONE WAY TO COMPLETE SPECIATION IS THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED REINFORCEMENT. REINFORCEMENT OCCURS WHERE NATURAL SELECTION FAVORS THE AVOIDANCE OF HYBRIDIZATION WHEN HYBRID OFFSPRINGS ARE LESS FIT. THIS PROJECT USES EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION?STUDYING EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE AS IT OCCURS?TO TRACK REPRODUCTIVE BARRIERS BETWEEN POPULATIONS OVER TIME. THE WORK WILL EXAMINE WHETHER RELATIVELY WEAK BARRIERS TO REPRODUCTION BETWEEN POPULATIONS ARE STRENGTHENED OR DECAY OVER TIME. USING THESE DATA, THE RESEARCHERS WILL DETERMINE THE SCENARIOS UNDER WHICH REINFORCEMENT CAN OCCUR. AS PART OF THIS PROJECT, HIGH SCHOOL, UNDERGRADUATE, AND GRADUATE-LEVEL STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING. AN OUTREACH PROGRAM OPERATING AT A LOCAL MIDDLE SCHOOL AND SCOUT TROOP WILL INCREASE EXPOSURE TO GENETICS AND PROMOTE INTEREST IN SCIENCE AMONGST UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. EVIDENCE FOR AND AGAINST THE EVOLUTION OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION BY REINFORCEMENT COMES LARGELY FROM COMPARATIVE APPROACHES AND SNAPSHOT STUDIES IN NATURAL POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THESE METHODS OFTEN ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES WHEN TRYING TO ASCRIBE PATTERNS OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION TO SPECIFIC EVOLUTIONARY FORCES. THIS PROJECT WILL DIRECTLY TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT REINFORCING SELECTION CAN OVERWHELM THE HOMOGENIZING FORCE OF GENE FLOW. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, THE WORK WILL FOLLOW THE EVOLUTION OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION IN POPULATIONS OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER THAT SHOW SOME DEGREE OF INITIAL REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION. SOME EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS WILL REMAIN ALLOPATRIC, WHILE OTHERS WILL EXPERIENCE GENE FLOW. IN THESE POPULATIONS, THE STRENGTH OF SELECTION AGAINST HYBRIDIZATION WILL BE MANIPULATED. A TIME SERIES OF MEASURES OF BOTH COMPETITIVE AND NON-COMPETITIVE REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION FROM THESE POPULATIONS WILL REVEAL THE ANSWERS TO THREE QUESTIONS. FIRST, HOW OFTEN AND HOW CONSISTENTLY IS REINFORCEMENT ABLE TO STRENGTHEN REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION? SECOND, HOW STRONG MUST SELECTION AGAINST HYBRIDS BE FOR THIS TO OCCUR?

AFRICAN LUNGFISH CAN SURVIVE LONG DROUGHT PERIODS VIA A PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS CALLED ESTIVATION. ESTIVATION INVOLVES DRASTIC REMODELING OF THE SKIN AND SHEDDING OF EPIDERMAL LAYERS TO FORM A COCOON. PREVIOUS WORK BY OUR GROUP DEMONSTRATED THAT THE LUNGFISH COCOON IS A LIVING TISSUE THAT CONTAINS MANY IMMUNE CELLS THAT TRAP BACTERIA, DEFENDING THE LUNGFISH BODY FROM PATHOGEN INVASION DURING A VULNERABLE, DORMANT STATE. FORMING THE COCOON, THEREFORE INVOLVES SELF-INFLICTING MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION BUT THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLAYING COCOON FORMATION ARE NOT UNDERSTOOD. THIS PROPOSAL INVESTIGATES A NOVEL MOLECULE CALLED PROTOP-CTXA WHICH IS A TOXIN ENCODED IN THE LUNGFISH GENOME. THIS TOXIN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED VIA HORIZONTAL GENE TRANSFER FROM BACTERIA OR VIRUSES. PROTOP-CTXA EXPRESSION IS HIGHLY UP-REGULATED IN THE LUNGFISH SKIN AND COCOON UPON ESTIVATION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THIS MOLECULE IS SUFFICIENT TO BREAK DOWN SKIN INTEGRITY IN ESTIVATING LUNGFISH AND FORM IN THIS WAY THE COCOON. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO INVESTIGATE WHICH CELLS PRODUCE PROTOP-CTXA IN FREE-SWIMMING AND ESTIVATING LUNGFISH AND TO DETERMINE THE INFLAMMATORY, ANTIMICROBIAL AND INSECTICIDAL FUNCTIONS OF PROTOP-CTXA. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE ON EXTREME PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS AND MAY RESULT IN MANY PHARMACEUTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS DUE TO THE BIOACTIVITY OF THIS TOXIN. BROADER IMPACTS INCLUDE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS A LUNGFISH EXHIBIT IN THE ALBUQUERQUE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH AND A RADIO PODCAST FOR THE CHILDREN HOUR AT KUNM. THE AFRICAN LUNGFISH (PROTOPTERUS SP.) LIVES IN BOTH WATER AND LAND. UNDER UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, LUNGFISH ENTER ESTIVATION, A DORMANT STATE THAT CAN LAST FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AND THAT INVOLVES THE FORMATION OF A MUCUS COCOON THAT SURROUNDS THE ANIMAL BODY. WE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT THE LUNGFISH COCOON IS NOT JUST A DRY MUCUS LAYER BUT IS FORMED BY MANY LIVING CELLS INCLUDING LARGE NUMBERS OF GRANULOCYTES THAT TRANSMIGRATE FROM THE SKIN WHEN LAYER AFTER LAYER OF EPIDERMIS IS SHED DURING THE INDUCTION OF ESTIVATION. COCOON FORMATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXTREME PRO-INFLAMMATORY STATE WITH HIGH EXPRESSION LEVELS OF CANONICAL PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AND ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES AND A LARGE INFLUX OF GRANULOCYTES FROM CIRCULATION. HOW THE COCOON IS FORMED AND MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION INSTIGATED IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON A NOVEL TOXIN-LIKE MOLECULE DISCOVERED IN THE RECENTLY SEQUENCED LUNGFISH GENOME. THIS TOXIN, SIMILAR TO VIBRIO CHOLERA TOXIN (CTXA), IS PHYLOGENETICALLY RELATED TO BOX JELLIES AND OTHER INVERTEBRATE TOXINS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT PROTOP-CTXA WAS ACQUIRED VIA HORIZONTAL GENE TRANSFER FROM PROKARYOTES TO LUNGFISH DURING EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY. PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT PROTOP-CTXA, IS VERY IMPORTANT DURING LUNGFISH ESTIVATION AND THAT DERMAL STEM CELLS EXPRESS IT AT THE STEADY STATE.

HOWEVER, NOT ALL CASES OF CONVERGENT EVOLUTION HAVE AN OBVIOUS ADVANTAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION OF C-TYPE CYTOCHROMES IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR PROPER FUNCTION AS PART OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN, WHICH PRODUCES AND REGULATES ENERGY FLOW IN CELLS. TWO DISTINCT BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS ARE USED TO ACHIEVE THIS MODIFICATION, AND MANY SPECIES HAVE CONVERGENTLY SWITCHED BETWEEN THESE TWO DISTINCT PATHWAYS. YET, BOTH PATHWAYS ACHIEVE THE SAME GOAL, SO THE EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE OF THIS PATHWAY SWITCH IS UNKNOWN. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE NUMEROUS CONVERGENT PATHWAY SWITCHES IN PLANTS AND GREEN ALGAE. THE PROJECT WILL USE A COMBINATION OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, GENETIC ENGINEERING, PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSAYS, AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY TO ASSESS THE MECHANISMS AND EVOLUTIONARY IMPORTANCE OF THIS PATHWAY SWITCH.

THE LHC MACHINE AND ATLAS, A LARGE PARTICLE DETECTOR FACILITY, WERE BUILT AS BASIC SCIENCE TOOLS USING FUNDS FROM NSF AND OTHER AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD. ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES WAS TO FIND THE HIGGS BOSON, THE LAST PARTICLE IN THE HISTORICALLY SUCCESSFUL STANDARD MODEL (SM) THAT ACCOUNTS FOR SO MUCH OF THE EXISTENCE OF, AND FORCES BETWEEN, KNOWN PARTICLES FORMING THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE. THIS EFFORT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. THE NEXT STEP IN THE EXPERIMENTS IS TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE FOR PHYSICS BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL (BSM) THAT MIGHT, FOR INSTANCE, ACCOUNT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE MYSTERIOUS DARK MATTER THAT MAKES UP SO MUCH OF THE MASS OF THE UNIVERSE. THE LHC IS CURRENTLY STARTING RUN 3, AT HIGHER ENERGY AND WITH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED EVENT SAMPLES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT EVIDENCE FOR BSM PHYSICS COULD EMERGE AT THIS HIGHER ENERGY AND WITH THE HIGHER EVENT STATISTICS. ANALYTICALLY, LOUISIANA TECH IS ONE OF THE LEADING INSTITUTIONS IN THE US PURSUING PRECISION QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS (QCD) MEASUREMENTS. IN PARTICULAR, THE GROUP APPLIES NOVEL APPROACHES, INCLUDING USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES, TO PRECISION MEASUREMENTS OF MULTI-JET FINAL STATES. SUCH STUDIES ARE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE MULTI-JET RATIOS THAT THE GROUP MEASURES PROVIDE A RELATIVELY PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF THE STRONG COUPLING CONSTANT, AN IMPORTANT PHYSICAL QUANTITY, IN A MANNER THAT AMELIORATES SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS. IN ADDITION, ANY DEVIATIONS OBSERVED IN SUCH MULTI-JET PARAMETERS WITH RESPECT TO QCD PREDICTIONS CAN PROVIDE A WINDOW TO NEW PHYSICS. IN SUPPORT OF THEIR WORK AND OTHER RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD, THE LOUISIANA TECH GROUP HAS CREATED FAST SOFTWARE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO MAKE FAST PERTURBATIVE QCD PREDICTIONS OF OBSERVABLES IN HADRONIC PROCESSES. IN THE BROADER CONTEXT, THE LHC PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT PLATFORM FOR PROVIDING OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION ABOUT BASIC SCIENCE TO K-12 STUDENTS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND SERVES AS A RECRUITING TOOL FOR PHYSICS MAJORS TO LOUISIANA TECH FROM THE NORTH LOUISIANA AREA.

THE ICECUBE DETECTOR FEATURES ONE CUBIC KILOMETER OF NATURAL ICE (AT THE DEPTH FROM 1.4 TO 2.4 KM) THAT HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A GIANT PARTICLE DETECTOR. THIS IS COMPLEMENTED BY A SURFACE ARRAY OF 162 PARTICLE DETECTORS CALLED ICETOP. BOTH THE IN-ICE AND SURFACE ARRAY DETECT ULTRA-SHORT LIGHT FLASHES FROM PARTICLE CASCADES INITIATED WHEN HIGH-ENERGY COSMIC RAYS HIT THE ATMOSPHERE. COMPLEMENTARY TO ICECUBE?S MAIN MISSION AS A NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY, THIS WORLD-UNIQUE SETUP ENABLES SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGIN OF GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS OF HIGHEST ENERGIES AND THE PARTICLE PHYSICS IN THE ATMOSPHERIC CASCADES. IN ADDITION TO RESEARCH AIMED AT FUNDAMENTAL PROGRESS IN COSMIC-RAY PHYSICS, THIS AWARD ALSO SUPPORTS SCIENTIFIC BROADER IMPACTS THROUGH ICECUBE?S COSMIC-RAY MEASUREMENTS, SUCH AS HELIOSPHERIC, SOLAR, AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE, SINCE STRATOSPHERIC AND SOLAR EVENTS CAN IMPACT THE COSMIC-RAY FLUX MEASURED BY ICECUBE. THUS, THIS AWARD ADDRESSES AND ADVANCES THE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF NSF'S WINDOWS ON THE UNIVERSE: THE ERA OF MULTI-MESSENGER ASTROPHYSICS PROGRAM AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE POLAR PROGRAM. THE MYSTIQUE OF THE SOUTH POLE ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMPELLING SCIENCE OF ICECUBE ARE AN ALLURING MIX. BESIDES ITS EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN NEWSPAPERS AND PUBLICATIONS POPULARIZING SCIENCE, ICECUBE HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB. THROUGH SUCCESSFUL HIGH SCHOOL MASTERCLASSES AS WELL AS STUDENT ENGAGEMENT IN THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, THIS PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO THE EDUCATION OF A DIVERSE STEM WORKFORCE. WITH ITS THREE-DIMENSIONAL LAYOUT, THE ICETOP SURFACE ARRAY ABOVE THE CUBIC-KILOMETER DEEP OPTICAL GRID, THE ICECUBE NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY IS ALSO AN EXCELLENT DETECTOR FOR COSMIC-RAY AIR SHOWERS. THE COMBINATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC PARTICLES AND LOW-ENERGY MUONS AT THE SURFACE AND TEV TO PEV MUONS BY THE DEEP IN-ICE GRID MAKES ICECUBE A WORLD-UNIQUE INSTRUMENT FOR THE MOST ENERGETIC GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS. COMPLEMENTING ICECUBE?S MULTIMESSENGER MISSION, THIS SETUP IS USED TO MEASURE THE COSMIC-RAY ENERGY SPECTRUM AND COMPOSITION IN THE ENERGY RANGE WHERE THE STILL-ENIGMATIC TRANSITION BETWEEN GALACTIC AND EXTRAGALACTIC COSMIC RAYS IS PRESUMED TO OCCUR. ICECUBE IS ALSO PROVIDING THE FIRST AND WORLD?S MOST SENSITIVE MEASUREMENTS OF LITTLE UNDERSTOOD COSMIC-RAY ANISOTROPIES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE AT TEV TO PEV ENERGIES. COMBINING DATA WITH THE HAWC GAMMA-RAY OBSERVATORY IN MEXICO, ICECUBE HAS ALSO COMPILED THE FIRST FULL-SKY COSMIC RAY ANISOTROPY OBSERVATION AT 10 TEV. PLANS TO PROVIDE COMBINED OBSERVATIONS AT HIGHER ENERGIES AND WITH OTHER EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS LHAASO ARE UNDERWAY. ICECUBE ALSO PLAYS A LEADING ROLE IN SCRUTINIZING HADRONIC INTERACTION MODELS OF THE PARTICLE PHYSICS IN AIR SHOWERS, IN PARTICULAR, THE FORWARD PRODUCTION OF LEPTONS. BY THIS, ICECUBE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MUON PUZZLE, A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE MEASURED MUON CONTENT OF AIR SHOWERS AND THE ONE PREDICTED BY STATE-OF-THE-ART HADRONIC INTERACTION MODELS. TO CONTINUE ICECUBE?S LEADING ROLE IN THIS ENERGY RANGE OF COSMIC-RAY PHYSICS, A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO INCREASE BOTH THE STATISTICS AND ACCURACY OF OUR DATA. THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STATISTICS RESULTS FROM ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION TIME WITH THE COMPLETE DETECTOR, BUT ALSO FROM EXPANDING THE ANALYZABLE DATA PHASE SPACE TO INCLUDE UNCONTAINED AND MORE INCLINED EVENTS. NEW EVENT RECONSTRUCTIONS APPLYING MACHINE-LEARNING TECHNIQUES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE SURFACE AND DEEP SIGNALS. HIGHER ACCURACY WILL ALSO RESULT FROM IMPLEMENTING A BETTER MODEL TO ACCOUNT FOR SNOW ON THE ICETOP TANKS, AS WELL AS CROSS-CHECKS WITH PROTOTYPE ENHANCED SURFACE INSTRUMENTATION. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL DRIVE ICECUBE?S COSMIC-RAY MISSION BY PROVIDING HIGHER SENSITIVITY AND RESOLUTION TAKEN TOGETHER, THEY PROVIDE A PATH TO FOLLOW TO CONTINUE ICECUBE?S CONTRIBUTION TO UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICS AND ORIGIN OF HIGHEST ENERGY GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS.

NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT NATURE PRODUCES MATERIALS WITH EXTRAORDINARY PROPERTIES, BE IT HIGH STRENGTH SPIDERWEB MADE OF THE PROTEIN SILK FIBROIN OR ROBUST PROTECTIVE COAT OF A BIOFILM BY FIBERS OF THE BACTERIAL PROTEIN CURLI. ONE OF THE STRONGEST AND MOST STABLE BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS IS THE ?AMYLOID?, WHICH IS FORMED FROM THE SELF-ASSOCIATION OF PROTEINS THAT PRODUCES DENSELY PACKED, ORDERLY PROTEIN MOLECULES WITH HIGH STABILITY AND ROBUST MATERIAL PROPERTIES. THE UNIQUE SELF-ASSEMBLY PROCESSES, MECHANICAL ROBUSTNESS, THERMAL AND BIOCOMPATIBILITY OF AMYLOID PROTEINS PROVIDE A RICH PLATFORM FOR POTENTIAL EXPLOITATION OF BIO-INSPIRED SYNTHETIC AMYLOID MATERIALS FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROTEIN AMINO ACID SEQUENCE AND MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF AMYLOID FIBERS IS LACKING. THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM WITH EXPERTISE IN MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS, SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY, AND MATERIALS SCIENCE TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN STRUCTURE, FUNCTION, PROCESSING, AND PROPERTIES IN A SERIES OF DE NOVO PEPTIDES DESIGNED TO MIMIC SPECIFIC SEQUENCES OF CURLI AMYLOIDS.

OUTREACH EFFORTS WILL BE DESIGNED TO ENGAGE THE FULL DIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI?S POPULATION, WHICH IS AMONG THE POOREST IN THE NATION AND REPRESENTS THE HIGHEST AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL POPULATION. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT ALTHOUGH AMYLOIDS ARE LINKED TO MANY PATHOLOGIES, IT IS BECOMING ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THEY ALSO PLAY FUNCTIONAL ROLES REQUIRED FOR CELLULAR PROCESSES IN BACTERIA, FUNGI, INSECTS, INVERTEBRATES, AND HUMANS. IN BACTERIA, THE PROTEIN CSGA CURLI FORMS AMYLOID FIBERS THAT ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF EXTRACELLULAR BIOFILMS, COATINGS UNDER WHICH BACTERIAL COLONIES THRIVE EVADING VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL INSULTS. CURLI AMYLOIDS ARE STRUCTURALLY CONSERVED CROSS-?-SHEET STRUCTURES THAT ACCOMMODATE TIGHTLY PACKED INTERACTIONS TO PROVIDE ROBUST MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR BIOFILMS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BASED ON THE CSGA SEQUENCE AS A TEMPLATE, ??EFFECTIVE VARIANT AMYLOID ANTIMICROBIAL MATERIALS CAN BE DESIGNED THROUGH SEQUENCE-MORPHOLOGY-BIOACTIVITY CORRELATIONS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS AND WILL ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF HOW TYPE AND POSITIONAL BIASES OF AMINO ACID IN THE SEQUENCE CORRELATE TO BIOCHEMICAL, MORPHOLOGY, AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE AGGREGATES. THESE WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: THE FIRST AIM WILL FOCUS ON THE RATIONAL DESIGN, SYNTHESIS AND BIOPHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF PEPTIDES AND PEPTIDE MIMICS ALONG WITH THEIR CELLULAR AND ANTI-MICROBIAL ACTIVITIES FROM CUES DERIVED FROM CURLI. THE SECOND AIM WILL FOCUS ON MATERIAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS MORPHOLOGY AND NANOMECHANICAL STABILITY, POROSITY, AND ABILITY TO FORM HYDROGELS. TOGETHER, THE PROPOSED ITERATIVE APPROACH WILL LAY A FOUNDATION FOR DESIGNING AMYLOID MATERIALS INSPIRED BY CURLI, BASED ON SEQUENCE, STRUCTURE, MORPHOLOGY, AND MICROBIAL ACTIVITY. THIS WILL ENHANCE OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF DE NOVO AMYLOIDS IN FUNDAMENTAL CELLULAR PROCESSES AND FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOMATERIALS FOR PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS.

FOR LARGER QUANTUM SYSTEMS, THEY PROPOSE TO USE ULTRACOLD-ATOM QUANTUM SIMULATORS, WHICH WILL BE ILLUSTRATED HERE FOR THE CASE OF ONE- AND TWO-ELECTRON ATOMS AS PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE CALCULATIONS. THE RECENT EXPERIMENTAL DEVELOPMENT BY DAVID WELD FROM UCSB HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL NEED FOR AND TIMELINESS OF THIS PROJECT. THIS PROJECT IS JOINTLY FUNDED BY THE ATOMIC, MOLECULAR, AND OPTICAL PHYSICS THEORY PROGRAM AND THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR).

THE CHIPS FOR AMERICA ACT CALLS FOR A $52 BILLION INVESTMENT IN DOMESTIC SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING AND RESEARCH, WHICH WILL CREATE 42,000 SEMICONDUCTOR JOBS IN 6 YEARS. HOWEVER, UNIVERSITIES ALONE CANNOT MEET THIS DEMAND BECAUSE MANY SEMICONDUCTOR JOBS ARE MORE SUITABLE FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THIS RET SITE ADDRESSES THE SEMICONDUCTOR TALENT DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE BY INTRODUCING STILLWATER AND TULSA AREA HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE TEACHERS TO A SIX-WEEK OPEN-SOURCE, CYBER-SECURE CHIP DESIGN EXPERIENCE. THESE EXPERIENCES WILL DEVELOP TEACHERS' FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SEMICONDUCTORS. TEACHERS WILL ALSO TRANSLATE THEIR RESEARCH INTO MUCH-NEEDED INQUIRY-BASED, CULTURALLY RELEVANT SEMICONDUCTOR CURRICULA IN GRADE 9-14 LEVELS. WITH MORE STUDENTS INTERESTED IN SEMICONDUCTORS, OUR NATION WILL HAVE A SUSTAINABLE TALENT PIPELINE TO RECLAIM OUR TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP IN SEMICONDUCTORS AND SEMICONDUCTOR-ENABLED TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS 5G/6G, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND QUANTUM COMPUTING. THE PROJECT ALSO SERVES A REGION WITH A HIGH MINORITY STUDENT POPULATION. HIGHER PARTICIPATION IN SEMICONDUCTORS WOULD ALSO IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK OF THE AREA AROUND OKLAHOMA, AN EPSCOR STATE. THIS RET PROGRAM WILL INVITE TEN HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE TEACHERS PER YEAR FROM STILLWATER AND TULSA METROPOLITAN AREA FOR THREE YEARS FOR A SIX-WEEK RESEARCH EXPERIENCE ON OPEN-SOURCE, CYBER-SECURE CHIP DESIGN AT OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU). TEACHERS WILL THEN TRANSLATE THEIR RESEARCH EXPERIENCE INTO INQUIRY-BASED AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT SEMICONDUCTOR CURRICULA IN GRADE 9-14. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE RET PROJECT ARE: 1) DEVELOP TEACHER'S KNOWLEDGE IN SEMICONDUCTORS, 2) CREATE INNOVATIVE SEMICONDUCTOR CURRICULA AT GRADE 9-14 LEVEL, AND 3) BUILD A LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OSU, TULSA REGIONAL STEM ALLIANCE (TRSA), PARTICIPATING SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO INCREASE STUDENT INTERESTS AND STIMULATE SEMICONDUCTOR EDUCATION IN OKLAHOMA. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT INCLUDES INCREASING AWARENESS OF CYBERSECURITY ISSUES RELATED TO HARDWARE AND LOWERING TEACHERS' BURDEN IN DEVELOPING NEW COURSES THROUGH OPEN-SOURCE TOOLS. THE BROADER IMPACTS INCLUDE RAPID SEMICONDUCTOR TALENT PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE CHIPS FOR AMERICA ACT BY INCREASING THE INTEREST LEVELS FOR SEMICONDUCTORS AMONG NON-COLLEGE GRADS, INCLUDING MINORITIES AND UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS.

STARS BEGIN THEIR LIVES IN GIANT, DUSTY CLOUDS OF GAS. THE ORION NEBULA IS A SPECTACULAR EXAMPLE OF SUCH A CLOUD IN WHICH MANY STARS ARE FORMING. A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING STAR FORMING REGION IS THE AQUILA RIFT, A MASSIVE EXPANSE OF DARK GAS CLOUDS. THE RIFT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE NO OTHER NEBULA SO LARGE AND POTENTIALLY RICH IN YOUNG STARS LIES THIS CLOSE TO THE SUN. FOR MANY DECADES ASTRONOMERS HAVE BEEN PUZZLED BY THE LACK OF YOUNG STARS IN THE RIFT BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ENOUGH GAS TO FORM ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND SUNS. YET ONLY A FEW YOUNG STARS HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE RIFT. ONE WAY TO FIND EVIDENCE OF FORMING STARS IS TO LOOK FOR HERBIG-HARO (HH) OBJECTS- DISTINCT JETS OF GAS THAT ARE PRODUCED BY YOUNG STARS. A NEW METHOD HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING SEVERAL DOZEN NEW HH OBJECTS IN THE RIFT, MANY IN PLACES WHERE NONE HAD BEEN SEEN BEFORE. THEIR DISCOVERY SHOWS THAT MANY MORE STARS ARE FORMING IN THE RIFT THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF THE RIFT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF STAR FORMATION WITHIN ITS CLOUDS. THE SURVEY WILL USE THE DARK ENERGY CAMERA (DECAM) ON THE BLANCO 4-METER TELESCOPE AT THE CERRO TOLOLO INTERAMERICAN OBSERVATORY, WHICH IS OPERATED BY NSF'S NOIRLAB. IT IS THE ONLY TELESCOPE IN THE WORLD THAT CAN DO THIS SEARCH. THIS SEARCH FOR HH OBJECTS IN THE RIFT WILL BE DEVELOPED BY DR. RECTOR INTO A CURRICULUM FOR UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE (CURE). CURES ARE AN ESTABLISHED INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL THAT INTEGRATES SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WITH EDUCATION BY GIVING INTRODUCTORY-LEVEL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO AUTHENTIC RESEARCH WITH REAL DATA. ITS GOALS ARE THREEFOLD: (1) TO TEACH THAT SCIENCE IS A PROCESS OF DISCOVERY, NOT JUST A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE, (2) TO IMPROVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE AND STEM CAREERS, AND (3) TO DEVELOP CRITICAL THINKING, TEAMWORK AND GOAL-DRIVEN WORK SKILLS IMPORTANT IN ANY CAREER. DR. PRATO WILL ALSO MENTOR HER UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND PARTICIPATE IN OUTREACH ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY AS A ROLE MODEL TO WOMEN IN SCIENCE AND TO GIRLS INTERESTED IN PURSUING SCIENCE AS A CAREER.

THE EXECUTION OF THIS WORK WILL INVOLVE PHOTOMETRIC SELECTION OF RED QUASAR CANDIDATES, SPECTROSCOPIC FOLLOW UP WITH NEAR-INFRARED AND OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY AT LARGE GROUND-BASED TELESCOPE FACILITIES, AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE SPECTRA TO DETERMINE FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF THE QUASARS SUCH AS REDSHIFT, REDDENING, INTRINSIC LUMINOSITY, BLACK HOLE MASS, AND ACCRETION RATE. THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE THE CONSTRUCTION OF STATISTICALLY COMPLETE SAMPLES OF DUST-REDDENED QUASARS SPANNING MORE THAN TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IN BOLOMETRIC AND RADIO LUMINOSITY.

A COMMON ROOT CAUSE CONTRIBUTING TO THE FREQUENT ROBOT JOINT FAILURES IS THE FAULTS WITH THE JOINT MOTORS AND THE ASSOCIATED SERVO DRIVES. UNFORTUNATELY, IN UNSTRUCTURED, REMOTE AND DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENTS, SUCH AS WHEN ROBOTS ARE DEPLOYED FOR SPACE EXPLORATION, NUCLEAR WASTE REMEDIATION, AND DISASTER RESCUE, NOT ONLY ARE FAILURES MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR, BUT IT IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TO PERFORM ROUTINE MAINTENANCE FOR THESE ROBOTS AFTER A FAILURE OCCURS. FAILURES OCCURRING IN OTHER SAFETY-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ROBOTIC SURGERY, REHABILITATION, AND HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION, COULD ALSO LEAD TO VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES OR ACCIDENTS. TO IMPROVE ROBUSTNESS, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AUTONOMOUS FAULT-TOLERANT AND FAIL-ACTIVE STRATEGIES FOR REDUNDANT ROBOT ARMS BASED ON PREDICTED AND IDENTIFIED JOINT FAULTS, WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY AND ROBUSTNESS OF REDUNDANT ROBOT ARMS. MOST OF THE CONVENTIONAL FAULT-TOLERANT CONTROL METHODS FOCUS ONLY ON FAILURE RECOVERY, AND UNFORTUNATELY IT IS USUALLY TOO LATE TO MITIGATE DAMAGES AFTER FAILURES OCCUR. THE KINEMATIC DESIGN OF OPTIMALLY FAULT-TOLERANT ROBOTS AND FAULT-TOLERANT MOTION PLANNING METHODS IN ANTICIPATION OF ALL POTENTIAL FAILURES CAN GUARANTEE TASK COMPLETION AND OPTIMAL POST-FAILURE PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, A NOVEL EFFICIENT METHOD IS PLANNED TO COMPUTE THE SIX-DIMENSIONAL FAULT-TOLERANT WORKSPACE THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE VOLUME AND SHAPE INFORMATION. THEN, THE OPTIMALLY FAULT-TOLERANT ROBOTS WILL BE DEIGNED BASED ON THE VOLUME AND SHAPE OF THE FAULT-TOLERANT WORKSPACE. ADDITIONALLY, EXISTING FAULT-TOLERANT MOTION-PLANNING ALGORITHMS ASSUME THAT ALL THE JOINTS HAVE EQUAL PROBABILITY TO FAIL, AND THEY CAN ONLY PROVIDE LOCAL OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS. IN THIS RESEARCH, THE POST-FAILURE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON PREDICTED JOINT FAILURE PROBABILITIES, AND A REAL-TIME MOTION PLANNING ALGORITHM WILL BE INTRODUCED TO COMPUTE A GLOBALLY OPTIMAL TRAJECTORY. FINALLY, THE PROGNOSTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHMS DIFFER FROM ALL THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES IN THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL SENSORS OR HARDWARE, BUT STILL MAINTAINS HIGH ACCURACY AND FAST PROGNOSTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC SPEED.

THIS WORK WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF DR. CARL TAPE. THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IS DIVIDED INTO PLATES THAT ARE IN CONSTANT MOTION AND COLLIDE, SLIDE PAST, OR PULL AWAY FROM EACH OTHER ALONG THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN PLATES. PLATE INTERACTIONS BUILD MOUNTAINS, CAUSE VOLCANIC ACTIVITY, AND PRODUCE LARGE EARTHQUAKES. ALASKA HOSTS ONE OF THE WORLD?S MOST SEISMICALLY ACTIVE PLATE BOUNDARIES, WHICH PRODUCED THE 1964 MAGNITUDE 9.2 EARTHQUAKE, THE LARGEST EVER RECORDED IN THE UNITED STATES. SCIENTISTS RELY ON THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODELS OF EARTH?S SUBSURFACE MATERIAL TO UNDERSTAND PLATE TECTONIC PROCESSES AND TO ASSESS GEOLOGIC HAZARDS. IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND LARGE EARTHQUAKES, SCIENTISTS MUST UNDERSTAND HOW SEISMIC WAVES INTERACT WITH EARTH?S SUBSURFACE MATERIALS. A PRIMARY LIMITATION TO MODELING THE SEISMIC WAVEFIELD IN SOUTHERN ALASKA IS THE LACK OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL OFFSHORE MODEL. PERMANENT SEISMIC STATIONS ARE ON LAND, FAR FROM OFFSHORE EARTHQUAKES, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MODEL GROUND MOTION AT COASTAL CITIES. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO BUILD AND TEST A THREE-DIMENSIONAL SUBSURFACE MODEL FOR THE GULF OF ALASKA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX EARTHQUAKE GROUND MOTION IN COASTAL REGIONS. THE GOAL IS TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL BY COMBINING EXISTING TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODELS FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS OF SEISMIC WAVE PROPAGATION WITHIN THIS MODEL WILL BE PERFORMED TO GENERATE PREDICTED SEISMOGRAMS THAT WILL BE COMPARED WITH RECORDED SEISMOGRAMS FROM MODERATE EARTHQUAKES IN THE REGION. THE FINAL MODEL WILL BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE VIA THE IRIS EARTH MODEL COLLABORATION, A PUBLIC REPOSITORY FOR EARTH MODELS. THE PROJECT WILL INVOLVE OUTREACH TO LOCAL COASTAL COMMUNITIES PRONE TO SEISMIC AND TSUNAMI HAZARDS. OFFSHORE REGIONS AT TECTONICALLY ACTIVE MARGINS, SUCH AS SOUTHERN ALASKA OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, OFTEN EXHIBIT EXTREME STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY AND PRODUCE A WIDE RANGE OF EARTHQUAKES IN TERMS OF MAGNITUDES AND MECHANISMS. IN SOUTHERN ALASKA, THE ACTIVE COLLISION AND ACCRETION OF THE YAKUTAT MICROPLATE BENEATH THE NORTH AMERICA PLATE AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE ACCRETIONARY WEDGE AT THIS ACTIVE SUBDUCTION ZONE ARE EXAMPLES OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF THE REGION. SMALL-SCALE AND LARGE-SCALE DEPLOYMENTS OF SEISMIC INSTRUMENTS ON LAND SUCH AS THE EARTHSCOPE TRANSPORTABLE ARRAY HAVE YIELDED NUMEROUS TOMOGRAPHIC MODELS OF THE MAINLAND ALASKA, MOST OF WHICH INCLUDE INHERENT SMOOTHING THAT CANNOT CAPTURE THE SHARP INTERFACES OF THE OFFSHORE SETTING. BY COMPARISON, THE OFFSHORE REGION OF THE GULF OF ALASKA HAS ONLY BEEN STUDIED WITH A SPARSE ASSORTMENT OF HIGH-RESOLUTION 2D VELOCITY MODELS DERIVED FROM MARINE STUDIES BETWEEN THE 1980S AND 2000S. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES LEVERAGING THESE EXISTING IMAGES FROM THE GULF OF ALASKA TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE 3D VELOCITY MODEL THAT WILL HAVE MANY USES SUCH AS MODELING THE SEISMIC WAVEFIELD, UNDERSTANDING ACTIVE TECTONICS, AND MODELING GEODYNAMICS OF THE SUBDUCTION SYSTEM. SYNTHETIC WAVEFORMS CALCULATED FROM THE RESULTANT 3D MODEL WILL BE COMPARED WITH SEISMOGRAMS RECORDED FROM MODERATE AND LARGE EARTHQUAKES IN THE STUDY AREA TO VALIDATE THE MODEL. SEISMOGRAM MISFIT VALUES WILL ALSO BE COMPARED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF OTHER AVAILABLE TOMOGRAPHIC MODELS.

MOUNTAIN BUILDING). FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE NORTHERN PATAGONIAN ANDES, THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY HAS PREVIOUSLY NOTED OBSERVATIONS THAT INDICATE THE REGION GOT COLDER AND DRIER DURING THE MIOCENE EPOCH. BUT, IT IS HARD TO KNOW IF THAT APPARENT COLD CLIMATE IS BECAUSE THE NORTHERN PATAGONIAN ANDES WERE AT HIGH ELEVATIONS IN THE MIOCENE (CAUSING THE LOCAL CLIMATE TO BE COLD) OR IF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT WAS RESPONDING TO CHANGES IN GLOBAL CLIMATE. THERE ARE TWO MAJOR PORTIONS OF THIS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP. IN THE FIRST PART, PI HAVRANEK WILL USE THREE DIFFERENT GEOCHEMISTRY TOOLS, ALL OF WHICH WERE DEVELOPED IN THE LAST 15 ? 20 YEARS, THAT CAN EACH SHED LIGHT ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CLIMATE AND TECTONICS SYSTEM OF THE NORTHERN PATAGONIAN ANDES IN THE MIOCENE. BECAUSE THE TOOLS PI HAVRANEK INTENDS TO USE ARE SO NEW, THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE KINDS OF DATA HAS ALWAYS BEEN DONE SEPARATELY FROM EACH OTHER. TO BE ABLE TO INTERPRET THEM TOGETHER, PI HAVRANEK WILL CREATE A LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION MODEL. THESE KINDS OF MODELS ARE INTENDED TO DESCRIBE THE WAYS THAT LANDFORMS (LIKE MOUNTAIN RANGES) CHANGE THROUGH TIME. THE MODEL WILL BE CAPABLE OF PREDICTING WHAT THE GEOCHEMICAL DATA SHOULD BE BASED ON DIFFERENT HYPOTHESIZED CLIMATE AND TECTONIC SCENARIOS. THEN IT IS POSSIBLE TO EVALUATE WHICH HYPOTHESIS BEST FITS ALL OF THE GEOCHEMICAL DATA. THE FINAL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO SHED LIGHT ON WHICH CAME FIRST, A COLD CLIMATE THAT ENABLED THE GROWTH OF THE NORTHERN PATAGONIAN ANDES, OR THE UPLIFT OF A MOUNTAIN RANGE THAT LOCALLY COOLED THE CLIMATE. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS KIND OF APPROACH COULD BE EXTENDED TO DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE WORLD. AS A PART OF THE FIELD WORK ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT, PI HAVRANEK WILL LEAD A SHORT COURSE ON STABLE ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY FOR STUDENTS AT UNIVERSIDAD DE LA PLATA. TO MAKE BOTH THE FIELD SITES AND LABORATORY SETTINGS USED FOR THIS PROJECT MORE ACCESSIBLE, PI HAVRANEK WILL PRODUCE A SERIES OF VIDEO TOURS OF THOSE SPACES. TWO HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS, RECRUITED THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO UPWARD BOUND TRIO-INSPIRE PROGRAM WILL HELP ASSESS THE VIDEOS AND MAKE THEM ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF VIEWERS. THE GEOSCIENCE COMMUNITY HAS LONG RECOGNIZED THAT CLIMATE AND TECTONICS ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED AND FEEDBACK ON EACH OTHER VIA EROSION AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION. OVER GEOLOGIC TIMESCALES, TECTONICS CAN MODULATE CLIMATE THROUGH SILICATE WEATHERING, AND CLIMATE CAN INFLUENCE DEEP-CRUSTAL PROCESSES BY CONTROLLING THE EXTENT OF WEATHERING AND EROSION. IT IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING TO DISENTANGLE THE PRIMARY DRIVER, CLIMATE OR TECTONICS, OF OBSERVATIONS IN THE ROCK RECORD. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A PALEOENVIRONMENT COOLED OVER TIME, THAT COOLING COULD BE DRIVEN BY EITHER SURFACE UPLIFT OR BY COOLING OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE. MANY OF THE PROXY TOOLS GEOCHEMISTS HAVE DEVELOPED TO TARGET QUESTIONS ABOUT CLIMATE AND TECTONICS TARGET EITHER PAST CLIMATIC CONDITIONS OR RATES OF ROCK EXHUMATION. FURTHERMORE, GEOCHEMICAL PROXY DATA ARE FREQUENTLY INTERPRETED IN ISOLATION TO INDEPENDENTLY CONSTRAIN EITHER CLIMATIC AND TECTONIC HISTORIES WITHOUT CONSIDERING THEIR CONCURRENT EVOLUTION. IN THIS PROJECT, THE AIM IS TO CO-INTERPRET THE CLIMATIC AND TECTONIC HISTORY OF THE PASO DEL SAPO BASIN IN THE NORTHERN PATAGONIAN ANDES (CHUBUT PROVINCE, ARGENTINA). THE PASO DEL SAPO BASIN IN THE BROKEN FORELAND OF THE ARGENTINE ANDES PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR INTEGRATING THERMOCHRONOLOGY, STABLE ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY, AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION MODELING BECAUSE THERE IS A WELL-DOCUMENTED GEOLOGIC CONTEXT, AND CLEAR, TESTABLE TECTONIC AND CLIMATIC HYPOTHESES EXIST. PI HAVRANEK WILL CREATE A RECORD OF 1) PALEOCLIMATE USING CARBONATE CLUMPED ISOTOPE THERMOMETRY AND VOLCANIC GLASS STABLE ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY AND 2) EXHUMATION USING LOW TEMPERATURE THERMOCHRONOLOGY (DETRITAL APATITE (U-TH)/HE). THEN, PI HAVRANEK WILL CREATE A LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION MODEL CAPABLE OF PREDICTING BOTH STABLE ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY AND LOW TEMPERATURE THERMOCHRONOLOGY DATA. THIS MODEL WILL BE USED TO TEST PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED TECTONIC AND CLIMATIC HYPOTHESES OF THE PASO DEL SAPO BASIN. THIS PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE A PROVEN FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE COUPLED STABLE ISOTOPE AND THERMOCHRONOLOGY STUDIES. THE PROJECT WILL SUPPORT: 1) THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A STABLE ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY SHORT COURSE AT UNIVERSIDAD DE LA PLATA; 2) THE CREATION OF ACCESSIBLE GEOSCIENCE EDUCATION VIDEOS; AND 3) MENTORSHIP OF TWO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO TRIO-INSPIRE UPWARD BOUND PROGRAM.

KATHERINE SHEK HAS BEEN AWARDED AN NSF EAR POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PLANS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF DR. ADAM WYMORE. THIS STUDY WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SOIL CARBON DYNAMICS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE THROUGH IDENTIFYING PATTERNS IN MICROBIAL COMPOSITION AND FUNCTION. CURRENT MODELS AIMING TO PREDICT SOIL CARBON DYNAMICS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY REPRESENT THE SMALL-SCALE PROCESSES CONTROLLING EMERGENT LARGE-SCALE PROCESSES SUCH AS CO2 GAS FLUX AND ORGANIC CARBON STORAGE, BECAUSE THE SMALL-SCALE PROCESSES ARE PERFORMED BY COMPLEX MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES THAT CAN CHANGE ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS. DR. SHEK WILL ADDRESS THIS DISCREPANCY THROUGH A SYNTHESIS OF LARGE DATASETS AVAILABLE THROUGH ECOLOGICAL AND EARTH SYSTEM MONITORING NETWORKS DESCRIBING GEOMICROBIOME STRUCTURE AND EMERGENT FUNCTIONS RELATED TO THE CARBON CYCLE. FROM THIS DATA SYNTHESIS, CROSS-SCALE PATTERNS IN GEOMICROBIAL PROCESSES WILL BE INTEGRATED TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF CARBON DYNAMICS IN EARTH SYSTEMS MODELS. BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CROSS-SCALE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GEOMICROBIOME VARIABILITY AND CARBON CYCLE PROCESSES WILL CONNECT SEVERAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND DISCIPLINES ADDRESSING URGENT CHALLENGES UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE. FOR INSTANCE, CHARACTERIZING GENERAL PATTERNS LINKING GEOMICROBIAL PROCESSES WITH CARBON CYCLING UNDER DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXTS COULD INFORM POLICY MAKERS, LAND MANAGERS AND SCIENTISTS AIMING TO PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CHANGE ON CARBON DYNAMICS. DR. SHEK?S RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN INCLUDES APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES AND TRAINING IN BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND DATA SCIENCE, WHILE PRESENTING FINDINGS AND COMMUNICATING SCIENCE WITH DIVERSE AUDIENCES INCLUDING BOTH NONSCIENTISTS AND FELLOW RESEARCHERS. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND CLIMATE ARE DIFFICULT TO CHARACTERIZE ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS DUE TO THE SCALE-DEPENDENCY OF ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES GOVERNING EMERGENT BIOGEOCHEMICAL OUTCOMES, ESPECIALLY THOSE ACTING ON THE MICRO SCALE. EARTH?S LARGEST TERRESTRIAL CARBON POOL IS IN SOILS, WHERE DIVERSE CONSORTIA OF MICROORGANISMS CONTROL THE TURNOVER AND STABILITY OF ORGANIC CARBON THROUGH MICRO SCALE DIFFERENCES IN METABOLIC ACTIVITY, DIRECTLY INFLUENCING EARTH?S CLIMATE. DESPITE GEOMICROBIAL CONTROLS DETERMINING SHIFTS IN SOIL ORGANIC CARBON DISTRIBUTION AND STABILITY, EARTH SYSTEMS MODELS (ESMS) AIMING TO PREDICT SOIL CARBON DYNAMICS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE DO NOT ADEQUATELY REPRESENT THESE FINE SCALE PROCESSES. BUILDING AN UNDERSTANDING OF CROSS-SCALE INTERACTIONS AMONG FACTORS CONTROLLING MACRO SCALE DIFFERENCES IN SOIL CARBON DYNAMICS REQUIRES PROCESS-BASED MODELING OF GEOMICROBIAL FUNCTIONAL PROFILES AND HOW THEY CHANGE ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS. THIS PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE THE ROBUST MICROBIAL METAGENOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATASETS AVAILABLE THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS NEON, LTER AND CZNET TO BUILD PROCESS-BASED MICROBIAL MODELS THAT WILL IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT SOIL CARBON UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE. DR. SHEK WILL USE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO DISTILL COMPLEX CROSS-SCALE GEOMICROBIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PATTERNS TO CHARACTERIZE GEOMICROBIOME-SOIL CARBON DYNAMICS ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS, AND THEN INTEGRATE THESE PATTERNS TO IMPROVE SOIL CARBON PROJECTIONS IN PROCESS-BASED ESMS. THIS FELLOWSHIP WILL ENABLE DR. SHEK TO SYNTHESIZE AN OPEN-SOURCE, CROSS-NETWORK DATABASE LINKING BIOGEOCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS WITH METAGENOMIC DATA FOR FELLOW EARTH SYSTEM AND ECOLOGICAL RESEARCHERS TO UTILIZE IN FUTURE STUDIES.

IN PARTS OF THE EASTERN UNITED STATES, LIKE WEST VIRGINIA, CLIMATE HAS ALREADY WARMED 0.5? ? 1.0? F OVER THE LAST CENTURY AND TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE ANOTHER 3? ? 4? F BY THE YEAR 2100, FURTHER WARMING STREAM AND SHALLOW GROUNDWATER TEMPERATURES AND AFFECTING THE ORGANISMS THAT LIVE THERE. STREAM TEMPERATURE PATTERNS PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE VULNERABILITY OF THESE STREAMS AND WATERSHEDS TO WARMING TEMPERATURES. HOWEVER, CURRENT MODELS DO NOT FULLY ACCOUNT FOR TEMPERATURE CHANGES CAUSED BY INTERACTIONS OF WATER ON THE SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND. MODEL PREDICTIONS OF GROUND AND SURFACE WATER TEMPERATURES IN A CHANGING CLIMATE MUST BE INFORMED BY THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THERMAL SIGNALS, INCLUDING CLIMATE, GEOLOGY, HYDROLOGY, LAND USE, AND LAND COVER. DATA SHOW STREAM TEMPERATURE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING CLIMATE ARE LIKELY DRIVEN (IN PART) BY CHANGES IN RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS AND TEMPERATURES OF DISCHARGING GROUNDWATER. THE FERNOW EXPERIMENTAL FOREST (FEF) IN WEST VIRGINIA HAS BEEN RECORDING TEMPERATURE DATA IN AT LEAST TEN HEADWATER WATERSHEDS SINCE 1958. USING THE FEF AS A WELL-CONTROLLED OUTDOOR LABORATORY TO STUDY THESE TEMPERATURE PATTERNS, RIDDELL WILL GENERATE IMPROVED MODELS AND BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THESE SYSTEMS. IMPROVED MODELS CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE WATERSHED RESPONSES TO DROUGHT OR HIGH INTENSITY PRECIPITATION EVENTS, AND ASSOCIATED DISASTERS SUCH AS FLOODING. THIS WORK WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN WV THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH THE NATIONAL YOUTH SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NYSF). THIS PROPOSED WORK IS IN THE MONONGAHELA NATIONAL FOREST WHERE THE NATIONAL YOUTH SCIENCE FOUNDATION HAS HOSTED ITS NATIONAL YOUTH SCIENCE CAMP SINCE 1963. THE FEF IS CLOSE TO THE CAMP AND THE NEWLY PURCHASED NATIONAL YOUTH SCIENCE CENTER (NYSCENTER) IN DAVIS, WV. DURING THIS PROJECT, COLLABORATION WITH NYSF STAFF WILL RESULT IN THE INSTALLATION OF A STREAM GAGE MONITORING STATION ON THE BLACKWATER RIVER, WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE NYSCENTER TO DELIVER HYDROLOGY EDUCATION TO MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN WV. THIS COLLABORATION WILL SUPPORT THE NYSF MISSION TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN STUDENT INTEREST IN STEM FIELDS AND PROMOTE HIGH SCHOOL RETENTION RATES AND THE PURSUANCE OF POST-SECONDARY STEM EDUCATION. CLIMATE CHANGE IS INCREASING ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES WHICH ALTERS THERMAL PATTERNS IN GROUNDWATER AND STREAMS, RESULTING IN REDUCED WATER QUALITY AND ECOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. THERMAL REGIMES IN SURFACE WATERS ARE HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY GROUNDWATER AND ITS CONNECTIVITY TO THE SURFACE, WHICH MAY BE DISCERNED BY COMPARING AIR AND STREAM TEMPERATURE RECORDS. PAIRED AIR-WATER TEMPERATURE ANALYSIS VIA SINE WAVE REGRESSION IS A WAY TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AIR TEMPERATURE AND SURFACE WATER TEMPERATURE TO ELUCIDATE THE GROUNDWATER CONTRIBUTIONS TO WATERSHED HYDRAULICS, COLD-WATER HABITAT REFUGIA, AND GROUNDWATER TEMPERATURE RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. RECENT RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON MODELING ANNUAL PAIRED-AIR/WATER TEMPERATURE SIGNALS TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF GROUNDWATER IN PROPAGATING AIR TEMPERATURE TO STREAM WATER FROM SUB-WATERSHED TO CONTINENTAL SCALES. RESULTS OF THESE SINE REGRESSION STUDIES ARE FOCUSED ON DETERMINING THE INPUTS OF GROUNDWATER TO SURFACE WATER AND THE EVENTUAL RESPONSE OF SURFACE WATER TO CLIMATE CHANGE BY COMPARING THE AMPLITUDE RATIOS (SINE CURVE PEAK HEIGHT) AND PHASE LAG SIGNALS (TIME BETWEEN PEAKS) OF AIR AND WATER TEMPERATURE RECORDS. DEEPER GROUNDWATER SIGNATURES SHOW LITTLE VARIATION IN ANNUAL TEMPERATURE AND HAVE AMBIGUOUS AMPLITUDE RATIO AND PHASE LAG WHEREAS SHALLOW GROUNDWATER SIGNATURES SHOW HIGH AMPLITUDE RATIOS AND MEASURABLE PHASE LAG ON THE ORDER OF DAYS. HOWEVER, CURRENT MODELS DO NOT FULLY ACCOUNT FOR GROUNDWATER ? SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS THAT INFLUENCE STREAM TEMPERATURES. THESE PROCESSES ARE GOVERNED BY AQUIFER CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS AQUIFER THICKNESS, POROSITY, HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY, AND BEDROCK TYPE AND DEPTH. THIS STUDY WILL UTILIZE THE FERNOW EXPERIMENTAL FOREST IN WV TO IMPROVE THERMAL STREAM MODEL EFFICACY IN SMALL AND INTERMEDIATE WATERSHEDS BY COLLECTING NEW GROUNDWATER TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS, ASSESSING THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERING BEDROCK GEOLOGY IN THE SAME WATERSHED, AND EXPLORING THE EFFICACY OF THESE MODELS IN HYDROLOGICALLY CONNECTED, NESTED WATERSHEDS AND IN WATERSHEDS IN WHICH AIR AND STREAM TEMPERATURE RECORDS EXIST ACROSS MULTIPLE DECADES. THIS STUDY WILL ADVANCE THE KNOWLEDGE OF GROUNDWATER CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEADWATER WATERSHEDS AND INTERMEDIATE WATERSHEDS INTO WHICH THEY DISCHARGE AND TO THE VULNERABILITY OF THESE WATERSHEDS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE CURRENT MODELS (SINE REGRESSION) BEING APPLIED TO LARGE, CONTINENTAL SIZE WATERSHEDS RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL HYDROGEOLOGY AND GEOLOGY ON GROUNDWATER BEHAVIOR AND THE SUBSEQUENT EFFECTS ON SURFACE STREAM TEMPERATURE PATTERNS. HOWEVER, NO STUDY HAS YET TO INTENSIVELY CHARACTERIZE THE SURFACE HYDROLOGY, HYDROGEOLOGY, AND BEDROCK GEOLOGY OF SMALL WATERSHEDS AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF ALL THESE FACTORS ON STREAM TEMPERATURE PATTERNS.

BY USING RATIONALLY DESIGNED RNAS AS BUILDING BLOCKS, IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO ASSEMBLE NUCLEIC ACID NANOPARTICLES, OR NANPS, WITH PRE-DEFINED PROPERTIES AND ARCHITECTURES. THE ABILITY TO READILY RESPOND TO CHANGES IN BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTS MAKES BIOCOMPATIBLE NANPS AN ATTRACTIVE MATERIAL FOR CLINICAL USE. ALSO, THE BIOCHEMICAL VERSATILITY OF NANPS CAN BE COMBINED WITH THE OPTICAL, ELECTRONIC, AND MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF INORGANIC NANOMATERIALS. THESE AUGMENTED NANPS CAN THEN BE ORGANIZED INTO SUPRAMOLECULAR ASSEMBLIES WITH CONTROLLED COMPLEXITY AND FUNCTIONS SUITABLE FOR A BROAD RANGE OF BIOMEDICAL, ELECTRONIC, AND IMAGING APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE RECENT PROGRESS, IT IS STILL A CHALLENGE TO ENGINEER SOPHISTICATED, RESPONSIVE, NANP SUPRA-ASSEMBLIES WITH REGULATED MORPHOLOGY. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROGRAM AIMS TO DEVELOP A GENERALIZABLE TOOLKIT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF STIMULI-RESPONSIVE NANP-BASED MATERIALS DESIGNED FOR END USERS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY. BUILDING FUNCTIONAL NANP SUPRA-ASSEMBLIES WILL IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF CURRENT THERAPEUTIC SYSTEMS, ALLOW FOR THE ENGINEERING OF RECONFIGURABLE BIOMATERIALS, AND BECOME INSTRUMENTAL IN FURTHERING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERACTIONS GOVERNING THE FUNCTION OF ENDOGENOUS BIOMOLECULES. DURING THIS PROGRAM, THE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE MULTIDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL RNA NANOTECHNOLOGY. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO EXPAND THE EDUCATIONAL DOMAIN CALLED OURNANO THAT REACHES OUT TO AND INFORMS THE COMMUNITY ABOUT RECENT ADVANCES IN THE FIELD OF RNA NANOTECHNOLOGY AND WILL CONTINUE CULTIVATING EXCITEMENT FOR RESEARCH THROUGH HOSTING COMMUNITY STEM EVENTS WITH LOCAL SCHOOLS AND SCIENCE MUSEUM. PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY RNA NANOTECHNOLOGY BENEFITS FROM RNA?S ABILITY TO ASSEMBLE THROUGH BOTH CANONICAL AND NON-CANONICAL BASE PAIRINGS THAT FORM 12 GEOMETRIC FAMILIES. THIS OFFERS A DIVERSE SET OF STRUCTURAL AND INTERACTING MOTIFS WHICH ALLOW FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF NUCLEIC ACID NANOPARTICLES (NANPS). THE VERSATILE BIOCHEMISTRY OF NANPS CAN BE COMBINED WITH THE OPTICAL, ELECTRONIC, AND MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF INORGANIC NANOMATERIALS. THE FURTHER ORGANIZATION OF THESE AUGMENTED NANPS INTO RATIONALLY DESIGNED SUPRAMOLECULAR ASSEMBLIES WITH CONTROLLED STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY CAN BE USED FOR APPLICATION IN BIOOPTICS, DESIGN OF RESPONSIVE DEVICES, SOFT BIOMIMETIC MACHINES, TISSUE MIMICS, AND ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES. DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR NANP DESIGN, THE USE OF NANPS AS MODULAR BUILDING BLOCKS FOR SUPRAMOLECULAR ASSEMBLIES HAS NEVER BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED. THEREFORE, THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BY DEVELOPING A GENERALIZABLE NANP-BASED PROGRAMMABLE PLATFORM THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY ENCODES TARGETED PHYSICOCHEMICAL, MECHANICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES THROUGH NETWORKS OF INDEPENDENTLY PROGRAMMABLE ARCHITECTURAL PARAMETERS. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE TEAM PROPOSES THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES: (I) CORRELATE THE PROGRAMMABLE PARAMETERS OF NANPS WITH THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THEIR SUPRAMOLECULAR ASSEMBLIES; (II) EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF FUNCTIONALIZATION OF INDIVIDUAL NANPS WITH INORGANIC NANOMATERIALS ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THEIR SUPRAMOLECULAR ASSEMBLIES; AND (III) INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF STIMULI-DEPENDENT KINETIC PATHWAYS ON THE PROPERTIES OF FUNCTIONAL SUPRAMOLECULAR ASSEMBLIES.

NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT THIS PROJECT AIMS TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT AFFECT MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF NANOPARTICLE ASSEMBLIES, INCLUDING FERROMAGNETIC LIQUID DROPLETS AND HYDROGEL SENSORS, SO THAT THEY CAN BE USED FOR CRITICAL HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS. FERROMAGNETIC LIQUID DROPLETS ARE LIQUID BODIES THAT CAN TAKE AND SUSTAIN VIRTUALLY ANY SHAPE WHILE IN LIQUID ENVIRONMENT AND CAN TRANSITION BETWEEN A NON-MAGNETIC OBJECT AND A PERMANENT MAGNET. THESE UNIQUE PROPERTIES COULD FIND APPLICATION IN DRUG DELIVERY, MICROFLUIDIC CHANNELS, AND ACTUATORS. SMART HYDROGEL SENSORS ARE ENVISIONED FOR CONTINUOUS HEALTH MONITORING DUE TO THEIR BIOCOMPATIBILITY AND SENSITIVITY TO, E.G., WATER ACIDITY, THAT ENLARGES OR SHRINKS THE HYDROGEL. EMBEDDED MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES UNDERGO A PHASE TRANSITION THAT CAN BE DETECTED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ELECTRIC WIRES INTO OR OUT OF THE HUMAN BODY. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES MENTORED RESEARCH TRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT TO GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND LEVERAGES INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES TO RECRUIT UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR ENGAGES THE SCIENCE-CURIOUS PUBLIC AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH VIA EXISTING UNIVERSITY SERVICES, SOCIAL MEDIA, LOCAL CONFERENCES, AND NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION-FUNDED OUTREACH PROGRAMS AND INTEGRATES HIS FINDINGS INTO UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE COURSES. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT MAGNETIC ORDER BY DISORDER IS A COMPLEX NON-TRIVIAL PHENOMENON THAT GOVERNS THE TRANSITION BETWEEN A VANISHING (SUPERPARAMAGNETIC) AND A STABLE (FERROMAGNETIC) MAGNETIZATION WITH LONG-RANGE, QUASI-LONG-RANGE, OR SHORT-RANGE ORDER. THIS COMPLEXITY IS EVEN LARGER IN LIQUID SYSTEMS THAT UNDERGO A REVERSIBLE TRANSFORMATION BETWEEN PARAMAGNETIC FERROFLUID AND FERROMAGNETIC LIQUID BY THE ASSEMBLY AND JAMMING OF SUPERPARAMAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES ON CURVED LIQUID-LIQUID INTERFACES. THE INTERFACIAL ASSEMBLY IS MEDIATED BY OPPOSITELY CHARGED LIGANDS THAT ANCHOR THE NANOPARTICLES AND REDUCE THEIR ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE AND SPACING. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE DESIGN STRATEGIES FOR DISORDERED ENSEMBLES OF SUPERPARAMAGNETIC NANOSTRUCTURES THAT COMBINE REVERSIBLE TRANSFORMATION BETWEEN SUPERPARAMAGNETISM AND FERROMAGNETISM WITH HARD-MAGNETIC PROPERTIES. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY STUDYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRUCTURAL SHORT-RANGE ORDER AND MAGNETIC PROPERTIES IN THE DRIED STATE USING NANOPARTICLE ASSEMBLIES AND LITHOGRAPHICALLY PATTERNED NANOSTRUCTURES WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DISORDER, SYMMETRY, LAYER THICKNESS, AND SPACING AND APPLYING THESE FINDINGS TO FERROMAGNETIC LIQUID DROPLETS. THROUGH COORDINATED EXPERIMENTAL AND NUMERICAL STUDIES USING MICROMAGNETIC MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS, MAGNETOMETRY, FERROMAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY, AND ADVANCED X-RAY AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPIES, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR CORROBORATES OR REFUTES THE FOLLOWING THREE HYPOTHESES: (1) MATERIALS WITH INCREASING DISORDER FAVOR A TRANSITION FROM FERROMAGNETISM TO NON-COLLINEAR MAGNETIZATION TO SUPERPARAMAGNETISM THAT IS DELAYED IN ANISOTROPIC ARRANGEMENTS; (2) STRUCTURAL SHORT-RANGE ORDER GOVERNING MAGNETIC ORDER CAN BE INFERRED FROM MACROSCOPIC PROPERTIES; AND (3) IN-FIELD ASSEMBLY AND JAMMING OF NANOPARTICLES AT LIQUID-LIQUID INTERFACES ENABLE NANOPATTERNING OF THE SURFACTANTS WITH AN ENHANCED REMANENT MAGNETIZATION AND COERCIVE FIELD.

THE COMBINED UV-VIS AND LPRS ANALYSIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY INFORMATIVE BECAUSE THIS APPROACH ENABLES CONCURRENT EXPERIMENTAL QUANTIFICATION OF A MATERIAL?S ABSORPTION EXTINCTION SPECTRUM, SCATTERING EXTINCTION SPECTRUM, SCATTERING DEPOLARIZATION SPECTRUM, FLUORESCENCE INTENSITY AND DEPOLARIZATION SPECTRA, AND FLUORESCENCE QUANTUM YIELD. COLLECTIVELY, THESE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES PROVIDE CRITICAL INSIGHTS, MANY BEING INACCESSIBLE BEFORE, ON THE SIZES, SHAPES, MOLECULAR COMPOSITIONS, AND OPTICAL ACTIVITIES OF MATERIALS. THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OUTLINED IN THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE A MULTICHANNEL LINEARLY POLARIZED SPECTROMETER CAPABLE OF CONCURRENT ACQUISITION OF THESE MULTIDIMENSIONAL SIGNATURES WITH SUB-SECOND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL STUDY THE FORMATION OF PORPHYRIN ASSEMBLIES AS MODEL SYSTEMS FOR DEVELOPING THE MEASUREMENT APPROACH AND WILL INVESTIGATE HOW THE ABSORPTION, SCATTERING, AND EMISSION PROPERTIES VARY DURING ASSEMBLY AND DISASSEMBLY. THESE STUDIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REVEAL MECHANISTIC PATHWAYS IN THE PORPHYRIN ASSEMBLY AND DISASSEMBLY PROCESSES. THE MEASUREMENT AND DATA ANALYSIS STRATEGIES DEVELOPED FOR THESE MODEL SYSTEMS WILL BE EXTENSIBLE TO NUMEROUS OTHER DYNAMIC SYSTEMS ACROSS A RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES, AND PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR ADVANCED STUDENT TRAINING AND THE ENGAGEMENT OF RESEARCHERS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS.

FOR INSTANCE, THE HOMOLOGY OF THE SURFACE OF A DONUT IS DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF THE SURFACE OF A DONUT HOLE, AND THIS IMPLIES THAT TURNING ONE OF THESE SURFACES INTO THE OTHER REQUIRES SOME CUTTING OR GLUING. HOMOLOGICAL INVARIANTS ARE GENERALLY DIFFICULT TO COMPUTE, ESPECIALLY IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS. INSTEAD OF COMPUTING THEM EXACTLY, THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GROWTH RATE OF THESE INVARIANTS FOR NATURALLY OCCURRING SEQUENCES OF SPACES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH CONCENTRATES ON SEVERAL LONG-STANDING CONJECTURES ON THE TOPOLOGY OF ASPHERICAL MANIFOLDS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO PROMOTE GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION THROUGH MENTORING AND OUTREACH. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO STUDY THE GROWTH OF HOMOLOGICAL INVARIANTS IN A RESIDUAL TOWER OF FINITE REGULAR COVERS OF AN ASPHERICAL COMPLEX. THE UNDERLYING MOTIVATION IS A CONJECTURE THAT LINEAR GROWTH OF RATIONAL BETTI NUMBERS IN SUCH A TOWER SHOULD OBSTRUCT THESE COMPLEXES BEING HOMOTOPY EQUIVALENT TO MANIFOLDS OF A CERTAIN DIMENSION.

THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO HARNESS A NEW CLASS OF ULTRATHIN OXIDE LAYERS FORMED ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOLTEN METALS GALLIUM AND INDIUM TO EFFICIENTLY FABRICATE HIGHLY CONDUCTIVE AND ULTRA-TRANSPARENT NANOSHEETS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AND PRECISELY CONTROL THE NANOSCALE ATOMIC COMPOSITION, CRYSTALLINITY, AND ELECTRON TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF THESE 2D OXIDE MATERIALS BY STACKING MULTIPLE LAYERS AND BY ENGINEERING THE OXIDATION OF LIQUID METAL ALLOYS FORMED FROM TIN, ZINC, AND GALLIUM.

THESE HIGH-PERFORMANCE TRANSPARENT CONDUCTING MATERIALS LEVERAGE A FUNDAMENTALLY NEW SYNTHETIC STRATEGY FOR PRINTING 2D OXIDE NANOSHEETS FROM THE SOLID OXIDE SKIN OF LIQUID METALS. INITIAL STUDIES OF 2D OXIDES REVEAL THEIR UNIQUE OVERLAPPING GRAIN MORPHOLOGIES, QUANTUM-CONFINED ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE, AND ULTRAHIGH ELECTRON MOBILITY. THIS WORK IDENTIFIES THE NANOSCALE MATERIAL ORIGINS OF THESE EXCEPTIONAL OPTOELECTRONIC PROPERTIES AND CONTROLS THE COMPOSITION, CRYSTALLINITY, AND CONDUCTIVITY OF MULTICOMPONENT 2D OXIDES BY ENGINEERING THE PHYSICS OF LIQUID METAL SURFACE OXIDATION. THESE STUDIES SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATE HOW METAL ALLOY COMPOSITION IMPACTS THE LOGARITHMIC GROWTH KINETICS OF SURFACE OXIDATION AND THEN CONNECT THIS PROCESS PHYSICS WITH 2D OXIDES?

THESE EXPERIMENTS TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SURFACE-DRIVEN DEFECT MODULATION DOPING FROM TYPE-II HETEROJUNCTIONS WITH INSULATING WIDE BANDGAP OXIDES (E.G. GALLIUM OXIDE) CAN DIRECTLY ENHANCE THE CONDUCTIVITY OF 2D METAL OXIDES. EXTRACTING THE ELECTRONIC DENSITY OF STATES IN COMBINATION WITH OPTICAL ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY CAN ALSO QUANTITATIVELY LINK ALLOY COMPOSITION WITH THE SURFACE OXIDES? ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE.

ALABAMA?S INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE OFTEN LIMITED IN LOCAL CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES, INCLUDING RESEARCH COMPUTING FACILITATOR EXPERTISE, AND IN EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGING NATIONAL CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES AND INVESTMENTS. THIS PROBLEM PUTS ALABAMA RESEARCHERS AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR SPONSORED RESEARCH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BENEFIT RESEARCH, HEALTHCARE, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA. THE DIVERSITY OF INSTITUTIONS AND PRIORITIES HAVE MADE THE CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A UNIFIED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE PLAN DIFFICULT. ALABAMA, HOWEVER, IS AT A UNIQUE MOMENT IN TIME WHERE FEDERAL, STATE, AND ACADEMIC RESEARCH PRIORITIES ARE ALIGNED TO INVEST IN STATEWIDE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE FOR RESEARCH AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ALABAMA EPSCOR (ALEPSCOR) RECENTLY COMPLETED A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY REPORT IDENTIFYING AREAS OF STRATEGIC RESEARCH IMPORTANCE. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THREE EXISTING EFFORTS: THE NSF CI COE: DEMO PILOT: MINORITY SERVING CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE CONSORTIUM, THE ALEPSCOR PLAN, AND GOVERNOR KAY IVEY?S ALABAMA EXECUTIVE ORDER 720 TO STIMULATE AN INNOVATION ECONOMY. THESE THREE EFFORTS NOT ONLY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE FOCUS ON BROADENING THE PLAYING FIELD, BUT ALSO BRINGING CRITICAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ENERGY TO THE TABLE TO TRANSFORM RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN ALABAMA FOR SMALLER INSTITUTIONS. THE PROJECT AIMS TO BRING TOGETHER A DIVERSE GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING 15 HBCUS, TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION AND ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING RESOURCES. THE TEAM WILL HOST OUTREACH EVENTS AT EACH OF THE EIGHT DOCTORAL DEGREE GRANTING UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE IN ADDITION TO ONE WITH INDUSTRY LEADERS IN THE STATE. THE EVENTS WILL BE HELD AT ALABAMA A&M UNIVERSITY, ALABAMA STATE UNIVERSITY, AUBURN UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT TUSCALOOSA, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT HUNTSVILLE, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA, AND TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY. THE PROJECT GOAL TO FOSTER IMPROVED AND BETTER COORDINATED ADVANCED RESEARCH COMPUTING AND NETWORKING CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE STATE'S INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION CAN CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED STEM PARTICIPATION, EDUCATION, AND WORKFORCE TRAINING. THE ALABAMA ADVANCED RESEARCH COMPUTING CONSORTIUM (AARCC) IS COMPOSED OF A STEERING COMMITTEE AND WORKING GROUPS FROM THE EIGHT DOCTORAL UNIVERSITIES, TWO OF WHICH ARE DESIGNATED HBCUS, AND INDUSTRY LEADERS IN THE STATE, TASKED WITH THREE DELIVERABLES: 1) A STATEWIDE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE PLAN, 2) A STATEWIDE RESEARCH NETWORK PLAN, AND 3) A STATEWIDE RESEARCH COMPUTING CONSORTIUM PLAN. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT EVENTS ARE BEING USED TO INFORM RESEARCHERS AND CAMPUS LEADERS ABOUT THE RESEARCH CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE, AND ALSO FOR AARCC TO LEARN ABOUT RESEARCH PRIORITIES AND CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE BARRIERS AT THOSE INSTITUTIONS. AARCC WILL ALSO COORDINATE WITH THE ALABAMA HIGHER EDUCATION CIO COUNCIL TO ADDRESS NEEDS FOR HIGH-CAPACITY NETWORKING WITHIN THE STATE. ULTIMATELY, AARCC SEEKS RESEARCH COMPETITIVENESS IN ALEPSCOR INVESTMENT PRIORITIES TO SPUR GROWTH OF THE MODERN 21ST CENTURY ALABAMA ECONOMY. THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ROLE OF COMPUTATIONAL EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE OF ALABAMA. PROVIDING A COLLABORATIVE STATE-WIDE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT VALUE, ESPECIALLY TO THE BULK OF THE INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE THAT SERVE UNDERREPRESENTED AND RURAL POPULATIONS.

IT ALSO OFFERS INTERMEDIATE ADD/DROP SUPPORT IN THREE OTHER LOCATIONS (INCLUDING KEENE STATE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN MAINE), WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR FUTURE PARTNERS TO CONNECT USING THE EXISTING NETWORK. THIS PROJECT FUNDS NETWORKING EQUIPMENT TO CREATE A GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE 400 GBPS NETWORK CONNECTION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE TO THE MASSACHUSETTS GREEN HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING CENTER AND THE NORTHERN CROSSROADS GIGAPOP WITH INTERMEDIATE ADD/DROP SUPPORT IN KEENE, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND PORTLAND, MAINE TO INTERCONNECT OTHER NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND RESEARCH PARTNERS IN THE FUTURE. THESE CONNECTIONS USE THE EXISTING DENSE WAVELENGTH DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (DWDM) NETWORK TO DELIVER MORE THAN 10 TIMES THE PRIOR CAPACITY. THIS PROJECT HAS POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO COLLABORATE, SHARE DATA, AND SHARE RESOURCES BETWEEN MAINE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES WILL BE RESEARCHERS AT SMALL, UNDER-RESOURCED INSTITUTIONS, TYPICALLY WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO WORLD-CLASS CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE THE NETWORKING UPDATES FROM THIS GRANT ALSO HAS POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE ABILITY OF OTHERS TO REACH MAINE, THE INFRASTRUCTURE WILL HELP WORLD-CLASS RESEARCHERS TO REACH MAINE K-12 STUDENTS. THIS ACCESS TO DIVERSE LEADERS AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH SERVES TO INCREASE ASPIRATIONS FOR MAINE STUDENTS. THIS EFFECT IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT FOR RURAL AND LESS AFFLUENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

A CENTRAL ASPECT OF THESE FIELDS IS THE STUDY OF POLYNOMIALS IN MANY VARIABLES - OR MULTIVARIATE POLYNOMIALS. MULTIVARIATE POLYNOMIALS APPEAR IN A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, ROBOTICS, COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN, AND NUMERICAL PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. THE RESEARCH WILL BE CLUSTERED IN THREE INTERCONNECTED AREAS WHERE MULTIVARIATE POLYNOMIALS PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE. THE FIRST IS CONFIGURATIONS OF LINEAR SUBSPACES, SUCH AS LINES IN THE PLANE. THE SECOND IS INTERPOLATION, WHICH INVOLVES FITTING DATA WITH A POLYNOMIAL MODEL. THE THIRD IS PIECEWISE POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS, OR SPLINES, SUCH AS THE BEZIER SPLINES COMMON IN DRAWING PROGRAMS. EACH OF THESE FIELDS HAVE MAJOR UNSOLVED CONJECTURES REVOLVING AROUND THE IMPACT OF COMBINATORICS AND GEOMETRY ON CORRESPONDING ALGEBRAIC OBJECTS. A RECURRING THEME OF THE PROJECT IS TO USE RIGIDITY THEORY, WHICH HAS ITS ORIGINS IN STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING, TO ELUCIDATE THIS IMPACT. SEVERAL LINES OF INQUIRY ARE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AMONG THE DISPARATE COMMUNITIES OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS, RIGIDITY THEORY, COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA, AND ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY. THE PROJECT INCLUDES TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS. THIS PROJECT IS JOINTLY FUNDED BY THE ALGEBRA AND NUMBER THEORY PROGRAM AND THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR). THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON PROBLEMS WHERE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GEOMETRY, COMBINATORICS, AND ALGEBRA ARE NOT WELL-UNDERSTOOD. A FIRST GOAL IS TO USE RIGIDITY THEORY TO SYSTEMATICALLY PRODUCE LINE ARRANGEMENTS WITH FIXED COMBINATORICS WHOSE MODULE OF DERIVATIONS HAS CHANGING STRUCTURE BASED ON THE GEOMETRY, GENERALIZING AN EXAMPLE OF ZIEGLER. UNDERSTANDING THESE EXAMPLES SHEDS ADDITIONAL LIGHT ON TERAO'S CONJECTURE, WHICH PROPOSES THAT FREENESS OF AN ARRANGEMENT IS COMBINATORIAL. A SECOND GOAL INVOLVES SEARCHING FOR A COUNTEREXAMPLE TO A CONJECTURE IN NUMERICAL ANALYSIS USING A HYBRID OF SYMBOLIC AND NUMERICAL METHODS BASED ON TECHNIQUES ANALOGOUS TO RIGIDITY THEORY. THIS CONJECTURE, WHICH IS LONG-STANDING, PROPOSES A FORMULA FOR THE DIMENSION OF THE SPACE OF SMOOTH CUBIC SPLINES ON TRIANGULATIONS. A THIRD GOAL IS TO STUDY ASYMPTOTIC CONTAINMENTS BETWEEN SYMBOLIC AND REGULAR POWERS OF IDEALS, WITH AN EYE TOWARD HIGHLY STRUCTURED EXAMPLES WHERE RECENT CONNECTIONS TO COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION AND LINEAR PROGRAMMING GIVE GOOD PROSPECTS FOR PROGRESS. DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES, THE THREE FOCUS AREAS ALLOW FOR A RICH EXCHANGE OF TECHNIQUES. FOR EXAMPLE, HOMOLOGICAL METHODS CONNECT HYPERPLANE ARRANGEMENTS AND SPLINES TO RIGIDITY, WHILE MACAULAY INVERSE SYSTEMS LINK SPLINES TO SYMBOLIC POWERS. THE PROJECTS ARE COMPUTATIONAL IN NATURE AND WILL INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CODE IN SYMBOLIC SOFTWARE (MACAULAY2) AND NUMERICAL SOFTWARE (BERTINI).

THE THEORY OF QUATERNION ALGEBRAS, EXAMPLES OF THESE STRUCTURES, WAS UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS, QUANTUM MECHANICS, AND THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY, WITH CURRENT APPLICATIONS IN FIELDS SUCH AS AEROSPACE MODELING, COMPUTER GRAPHICS, ROBOTICS, AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION. IN MATHEMATICS, CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS AND THE ASSOCIATED BRAUER GROUP HAVE PROVIDED A BRIDGE FOR TECHNIQUES TO BE EXCHANGED BETWEEN DIVERSE AREAS OF RESEARCH, FROM NUMBER THEORY AND ARITHMETIC GEOMETRY, TO TOPOLOGY AND ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO BROADEN A RELATIVELY NEW FRONTIER BETWEEN THE SPLITTING FIELDS OF CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS AND THE ARITHMETIC OF ELLIPTIC CURVES, WHICH ARE THEMSELVES IMPORTANT MATHEMATICAL OBJECTS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO SUPPORT NEW PEDAGOGICAL TOOLS, OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT, EARLY CAREER MENTORING AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND CROSS-DISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION. MORE PRECISELY, THIS PROJECT CENTERS AROUND THREE MAIN PROBLEMS: THE PERIOD-INDEX PROBLEM FOR THE BRAUER GROUP, THE PROBLEM OF SPLITTING CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS BY GENUS ONE CURVES, AND EXPLICIT PRESENTATIONS OF MODULI SPACES OF ELLIPTIC CURVES. THE TECHNIQUES UTILIZED---TOROIDAL GEOMETRY, DEFORMATION THEORY, AND HILBERT SCHEMES---ARE WIDELY EMPLOYED IN ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY, BUT LESS SYSTEMATICALLY SO IN PURE ALGEBRA. WHILE MUCH RECENT PROGRESS IN THE PERIOD-INDEX PROBLEM FOR THE BRAUER GROUP HAS BEEN THROUGH LEVERAGING TOOLS FROM ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY TO CONTROL RAMIFICATION SPLITTING, THIS PROJECT ADOPTS NOVEL TOOLS SUCH AS RECIPROCITY SEQUENCES TO ACHIEVE IMPROVED RESULTS AS WELL AS INDICATE LONG-TERM CONJECTURAL TARGETS. THE PROBLEM OF WHETHER ANY BRAUER CLASS IS SPLIT BY THE FUNCTION FIELD OF A GENUS ONE CURVE, WHILE HAVING ONLY GAINED ATTENTION IN THE PAST DECADE, TURNS OUT TO HAVE SURPRISING AND DEEP CONNECTIONS TO OTHER IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN ALGEBRA, NUMBER THEORY, AND ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY. THE PROJECT INITIATES A WIDE-RANGING PROGRAM EXPLOITING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THIS PROBLEM, THE CLASSICAL OPEN PROBLEM OF CYCLICITY OF CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS IN PRIME DEGREE, THE PERIOD-INDEX PROBLEM FOR ABELIAN VARIETY TORSORS, THE ARITHMETIC OF MODULAR CURVES, AND THE PROBLEM OF EXPLICIT CONSTRUCTIONS OF MODULI SPACES OF ELLIPTIC CURVES.

MANY POSITIVE STRAND RNA (+SSRNA) VIRUSES, WHICH INCLUDE CORONAVIRUSES AND NOROVIRUSES, ARE PATHOGENIC TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS. THESE VIRUSES CAN SURVIVE IN AIR, AQUEOUS DISPERSIONS, AND ON SURFACES. ULTRAVIOLET GERMICIDAL SYSTEMS EMITTING UV-C RADIATION (200-280 NM IN WAVELENGTH) HAVE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE AT INACTIVATING VIRAL PATHOGENS ATTACHED TO VARIOUS MEDIA AND SUBSTRATES INCLUDING RESPIRATORY AEROSOLS, AQUEOUS DISPERSIONS, AND NON-POROUS SURFACES. HOWEVER, A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE UV-C SENSITIVITY OF SSRNA VIRUSES AND THEIR EXTENTS, RATES, AND MECHANISMS OF INACTIVATION BY GERMICIDAL UV-C RADIATION HAS REMAINED ELUSIVE. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A GENOMIC-BASED MODEL THAT COULD BE USED TO 1) ESTIMATE THE UV-C SENSITIVITY OF PATHOGENIC SSRNA VIRUSES AND 2) PREDICT THE UV-C DOSES AND EXPOSURE TIMES REQUIRED TO INACTIVATE SUCH VIRUSES IN AQUEOUS DISPERSIONS AND SURFACES.

ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO SOCIETY WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH OUTREACH AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THE MENTORING OF A POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND FOUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY AND ONE GRADUATE STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, KNOXVILLE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF UV-C IRRADIATION AT INACTIVATING VIRAL PATHOGENS IN A GIVEN MEDIUM DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING VIRAL CONCENTRATION, RADIATION DOSE AND EXPOSURE TIME, AND THE VIRUS UV-C SUSCEPTIBILITY (D90) DEFINED AS THE REQUIRED RADIATION DOSE (JOULE/M2) TO INACTIVATE 90% OF THE VIRAL PATHOGENS. HOWEVER, MEASURED UV-C SUSCEPTIBILITY DATA FOR MANY POSITIVE STRAND RNA (+SSRNA) VIRUSES THAT ARE PATHOGENIC TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS ARE NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLLECTION OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA ON VIRAL PATHOGENS INCLUDING THE NEED FOR BIOSAFETY LEVEL-3 (BSL-3) FACILITIES AND A SPECIALIZED AND HIGHLY TRAINED WORKFORCE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A MATHEMATICAL MODEL (BASED ON VIRAL GENOMIC PARAMETERS SUCH AS GENOME SIZE AND PYRIMIDINE DINUCLEOTIDE FREQUENCY) THAT COULD BE USED TO PREDICT THE UV-C SUSCEPTIBILITY OF PATHOGENIC +SSRNA VIRUSES IN AIR, AQUEOUS DISPERSIONS, AND ONTO SURFACES AT STANDARD AMBIENT CONDITIONS. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH INCLUDE: 1) COLLECTION AND/OR GENERATION OF UV-C SUSCEPTIBILITY DATA FOR A SET OF MODEL SSRNA VIRUSES FOR MODEL CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION; 2) DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS (QSARS) TO PREDICT WAVELENGTH SPECIFIC UV-C SUSCEPTIBILITY OF +SSRNA VIRUSES BY ANALYZING THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN GENOME PARAMETERS (GENOME SIZE, SEQUENCE-BASED PYRIMIDINE DINUCLEOTIDE FREQUENCY VALUE, TRP AND TYR CONTENT) AND THE UV-C SUSCEPTIBILITY DATA THAT WERE COLLECTED IN OBJECTIVE 1 ; AND 3) DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A JAVA COMPUTER INTERFACE THAT UTILIZES THE QSARS DEVELOPED IN OBJECTIVE 2 TO ESTIMATE THE UV-C RADIATION DOSE AND EXPOSURE TIME REQUIRED TO INACTIVE +SSRNA VIRUSES IN AIR, AQUEOUS DISPERSIONS, AND ONTO SURFACES.

WHILE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ICS) ARE UBIQUITOUSLY DEPLOYED IN MODERN ELECTRONIC/INFORMATION SYSTEMS THAT PROCESS CRITICAL DATA IN OUR DAILY LIVES, THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF THESE ICS HOWEVER ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES AND ALTERATIONS DUE TO THE GLOBALIZATION OF ELECTRONIC DESIGN SUPPLY CHAIN (I.E., MOST OF THE ICS USED IN ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS ARE NOW FABRICATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES). AN ADVERSARY (UNTRUSTED FOUNDRY) COULD POTENTIALLY SUBVERT THE FABRICATION PROCESS ITSELF BY IMPLANTING A HARDWARE TROJAN INTO THE IC MASK TO DISABLE AND/OR DESTROY A SYSTEM AT SOME FUTURE TIME OR THE TROJAN MAY SERVE TO LEAK CONFIDENTIAL/SENSITIVE INFORMATION COVERTLY TO THE ADVERSARY. TODAY, TROJANS CAN BE CLEVERLY HIDDEN BY THE ADVERSARY TO MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR CHIP TEST/VALIDATION PROCESSES (SINCE THE ADVERSARY HAS COMPLETE ACCESS TO TEST INFORMATION AS MANUFACTURING TESTS ARE TYPICALLY PERFORMED AT THE CHIP FABRICATION SITE).

BLACK CARBON (BC) IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN HEALTH PROBLEMS SUCH AS RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND CANCER. THUS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KNOW CONCENTRATIONS OF CO2 AND BC AND HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF DIRECT RADIATIVE FORCING (DRF) DUE TO CO2 AND BLACK CARBON AT A CITY LEVEL. CURRENT RADIATIVE FORCING IS ESTIMATED AT A REGIONAL OR GLOBAL LEVEL DUE TO LIMITED CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS OF CO2 AND BC. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE TEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF CO2 AND BC AT ONE URBAN SITE AND DEVELOP A UNIQUE APPROACH TO ESTIMATE RADIATIVE FORCING AT A CITY LEVEL. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL HELP BETTER UNDERSTAND LARGER UNCERTAINTIES IN CLIMATE CHANGE PREDICTION BY VARIOUS CLIMATE MODELS. ALSO, THIS RESEARCH EXPOSES BOTH GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO REAL-LIFE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND PROVIDES THEM GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN QUANTITATIVE SKILLS USED IN THE FIELDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE. THIS WILL IN TURN HELP INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MINORITY STUDENTS WHO WILL PURSUE STEM DEGREES.

HOWEVER, MANY CHALLENGES ARE STILL BEING FACED WITH THERAPEUTIC DELIVERY TO SPECIFIC TISSUES AND CELLS AND HIGH DOSAGES CAUSING UNWANTED SIDE EFFECTS. BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERIC NANOPARTICLES OFFER MANY ADVANTAGES FOR THE DELIVERY OF THERAPEUTIC DRUGS AND VACCINES, SUCH AS CELL AND TISSUE TARGETING, SLOW-RELEASE, AND REDUCED SIDE EFFECTS TO ENHANCE THE EFFICACY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO SHOW THAT BY USING NANOPARTICLES OF SIMILAR SIZE AND SHAPE, BETTER CELL UPTAKE AND DELIVERY WILL RESULT IN IMPROVED EFFICACY. THE INNOVATIVENESS OF THIS PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP SAFE AND NOVEL THERAPEUTICS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE FOR MANY INFECTIOUS DISEASES CAUSED BY BACTERIA, VIRUSES, FUNGI, AS WELL AS CANCERS. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE RESEARCH TRAINING AND MENTORING TO UNDERREPRESENTED UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS IN STEM FIELDS AT ALABAMA STATE UNIVERSITY FROM DISCIPLINES SUCH AS NANOTECHNOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY, CELL BIOLOGY, GENOMICS, AND PROTEOMICS. STUDENTS WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED OTHER EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING SEMINARS, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ETHICS IN RESEARCH, SCIENTIFIC WRITING, AND PRESENTATIONS AT SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS. THE PROJECT WILL CONSIDERABLY STRENGTHEN THE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL SKILLS OF STUDENTS TO BRING DIVERSITY TO THE GLOBAL WORKFORCE. ENDOCYTOSIS IS ONE MAJOR ROUTE THAT REGULATES BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERIC NANOPARTICLE UPTAKE AND TRANSPORT MECHANISMS IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS FOR THERAPEUTIC DELIVERY. UNDERSTANDING THE ENDOCYTOSIS MECHANISMS OF NANOPARTICLES IS CRITICAL FOR EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC DELIVERY AND FUNCTION, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THEIR HOMOGENEOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. MUCH OF WHAT IS KNOWN FOR THE DELIVERY OF THERAPEUTICS COMES FROM HETEROGENEOUS RATHER THAN HOMOGENEOUS POLYMERIC NANOPARTICLES. ALTHOUGH BOTH NANOPARTICLE TYPES MAY HAVE DISTINCT ENDOCYTOSIS MECHANISMS DUE TO THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, THERE IS A PAUCITY OF DATA ON THE ENDOCYTOSIS MECHANISM REGULATING HOMOGENEOUS NANOPARTICLES' CELLULAR UPTAKE AND IMPACT ON THERAPEUTIC DELIVERY AND FUNCTION. THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED IS THAT THERAPEUTIC DELIVERY EFFICIENCY IS DEPENDENT ON THE HOMOGENEITY OF NANOPARTICLES; HOMOGENEOUS RATHER THAN HETEROGENEOUS NANOPARTICLES WILL BE MORE EFFICIENTLY ENDOCYTOSED TO IMPROVE THERAPEUTIC DELIVERY AND FUNCTION DUE TO UNIFORMITY AND DISTINCT ENDOCYTOSIS MECHANISMS. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON INTRACELLULAR PROTEIN TARGETING FOR DELIVERY OF A CHLAMYDIAL BACTERIAL PROTEIN ENCAPSULATED IN POLY D, L-LACTIDE-CO-GLYCOLIDE, AND POLY(LACTIC ACID)-POLY(ETHYLENE GLYCOL TO EVALUATE THE INTERACTION WITH DENDRITIC CELLS AS ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS IN VITRO AND MICE. THE OBJECTIVES ARE: 1) TO FORMULATE AND CHARACTERIZE THE ENCAPSULATED PROTEIN TO UNDERSTAND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH DENDRITIC CELLS LEADING TO UPTAKE AND REGULATION OF CELLULAR FUNCTION; 2) TO DECIPHER THE SPECIFIC ENDOCYTOSIS PATHWAY EXPLOITED BY THE ENCAPSULATED PROTEIN OF DIFFERENT SIZE AND FORMULATION, 3) TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF SPECIFIC ENDOCYTOSIS PATHWAYS REGULATING THE ENCAPSULATED PROTEIN UPTAKE AND THERAPEUTIC FUNCTION IN MICE, AND 4) TO EXTEND THE DENDRITIC CELLS FINDINGS TO OTHER CELL LINEAGES. THE RESEARCH WILL EXPLOIT VARIOUS MECHANISTIC APPROACHES TO UNVEIL NEW KNOWLEDGE LEADING TO SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH-RELATED DISEASES. THE RESULTS WILL SHOW HOW ENDOCYTOSIS DIFFERENTIALLY REGULATES THE DELIVERY OF HOMOGENEOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS NANOPARTICLES TO ENHANCE TARGETED DELIVERY AND THERAPEUTIC FUNCTION. THE NEW KNOWLEDGE WILL ENABLE SCIENTISTS TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS SIZE-SPECIFIC INTRACELLULAR NANOCARRIERS FOR THERAPEUTICS TARGETING MULTIPURPOSE BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS. THE BROADER IMPACT IS THAT THE FINDINGS WILL APPLY TO MORE CATEGORIES OF NANOPARTICLES, FURTHER ADVANCING NEW SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE LEADING TO NOVEL NANOTHERAPEUTICS IMPACTING BIOMEDICAL AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL APPLICATIONS.

FUTURE CYBERATTACKS ON CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED VEHICLES WILL NECESSITATE THE STUDY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL COUNTERMEASURES TO INCREASE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THESE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH COULD IMPROVE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS, VEHICLE AND PERSONAL SAFETY, AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THIS AWARD WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF UNDERREPRESENTED UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS IN MODELING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND COMMUNICATION TO ADDRESS CYBERSECURITY ISSUES IN CONNECTED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. THE PRIME OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO CREATE A DEFENSE TECHNIQUE THAT WILL ENABLE CONNECTED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO BE MORE RESISTANT TO ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS AND HENCE CAPABLE OF MEETING MORE STRINGENT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS. ANOTHER KEY FOCUS IS TO INVOLVE TEAMS OF UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS IN CREATIVE INQUIRY AND DESIGN PROJECTS BASED ON HANDS-ON DEMO PLATFORMS.

INCREASINGLY, CITIZENS ARE RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL DANGERS OF INDUSTRIAL PLANTS THAT PRODUCE AND STORE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS, AND ONE MAJOR CONCERN IS THE RELEASE OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) INTO THE AIR THEY BREATHE. THIS STUDY IS CONCERNED WITH THE 'EPOXIDE' CLASS OF COMPOUNDS. ETHYLENE OXIDE AND PROPENE OXIDE ARE COMMON COMMODITY CHEMICALS OF THE EPOXIDE FAMILY WITH A VARIETY OF IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL PURPOSES BUT THEY ARE ALSO CARCINOGENIC. UNDERSTANDING THE FATE OF THESE AND RELATED VOC IN THE ATMOSPHERE, THROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF LIKELY DECOMPOSITION MECHANISMS AND RATES, IS CRITICAL. THE PROPOSED COMPUTATIONAL MODELING STUDY SEEKS TO EXTEND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEGRADATION REACTIONS, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SUGGEST NEW REACTIONS THAT CAN REMEDIATE POLLUTANTS. THE STUDY IS DESIGNED FOR FULL PARTICIPATION BY UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH STUDENTS FROM XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA, A PRIMARILY UNDERGRADUATE AND HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY (HBCU), WHERE THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN, AND SCIENCE MAJORS. THE COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSES PROVIDE EXCELLENT TRAINING EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATES THAT WILL PREPARE THEM FOR GRADUATE STUDIES AND CAREERS IN STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS) FIELDS. THIS STUDY WILL ALSO ENABLE STUDENTS TO CONNECT BASIC SCIENCE RESEARCH TO THE REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS THAT UNDERLIE THIS PROJECT. THE PROPOSED COMPUTATIONAL STUDY IS CONCERNED WITH GAS-PHASE RADICAL REACTIONS OF SIMPLE EPOXIDES. EPOXIDES OF INTEREST INCLUDE ETHYLENE OXIDE, PROPENE OXIDE, CIS- AND TRANS-2-BUTENE OXIDE, 2-METHYLPROPENE OXIDE, AND EPIFLUOROHYDRIN. THREE TYPES OF CALCULATIONS, USING COMMERCIALLY-AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, WILL BE CONSIDERED TO EXPLORE THE INFLUENCE OF SUBSTITUENTS ON EPOXIDE REACTIVITY: (1) EPOXIDE BOND DISSOCIATION ENERGIES; (2) DEGRADATION OF PARENT EPOXIDES AND/OR THEIR RADICAL COUNTERPARTS; AND (3) ADDITION REACTIONS OF HYDROXYL RADICAL AND OTHER RADICAL SPECIES TO EPOXIDES. TOGETHER, THESE CALCULATIONS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE BEHAVIOR OF EPOXIDES IN THE GAS PHASE, AND THE EFFECTS OF SUBSTITUENTS ON EPOXIDE REACTIVITY AND DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS.

FIRE SAFETY SCIENCE HAS FOUND THAT PREDICTING HOW OCCUPANTS RESPOND DURING FIRES CAN IMPROVE BUILDING DESIGNS AND SAFETY SYSTEMS. IDENTIFYING WHETHER A REAL THREAT IS PRESENT IS A CRUCIAL STEP IN BUILDING OCCUPANTS TAKING ACTION DURING A FIRE. PAST STUDIES OBSERVED THAT INITIAL SIGNS OF A FIRE TEND TO BE AMBIGUOUS, WITH OCCUPANTS OFTEN INVESTIGATING THE SOURCE.

LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHAT DRIVES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY NEEDED FOR SPECIES TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE IN HIGHLY VARIABLE ENVIRONMENTS. THIS RESEARCH WILL USE GENETIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL TOOLS AND APPROACHES DEVELOPED FOR NORTH AMERICAN KILLIFISH TO GAIN AN INTEGRATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW EXTREME PHYSIOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY IS ASSEMBLED AND HOW IT WORKS. WITHIN THE FUNDULUS GENUS, SOME SPECIES OF FISH ARE HIGHLY FLEXIBLE AND CAN ADJUST TO HUGE EXTREMES IN ENVIRONMENTAL SALINITY, BUT OTHERS ARE MUCH LESS FLEXIBLE. HIGH-FLEXIBILITY SPECIES ARE COMPARED TO CLOSELY-RELATED LOW-FLEXIBILITY SPECIES, FOR MULTIPLE PAIRS OF SPECIES. THIS COMPARATIVE APPROACH IS POWERFUL FOR DISTINGUISHING WHAT MAKES HIGH-FLEXIBILITY SPECIES UNIQUE. RESULTS SHOULD PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO HOW FEATURES OF THE GENOME (VARIATION IN GENE SEQUENCES, VARIATION IN GENETIC CONTROL ELEMENTS, VARIATION IN GENE CONTENT) MAY ENABLE OR DISABLE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENTS TO EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. ONE HALLMARK OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY, AND THIS VARIABILITY IS POSING YET ANOTHER THREAT TO THE GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY CRISIS.

IN CONTRAST, EURYHALINE SPECIES CAN ADJUST THEIR PHYSIOLOGY TO ACCOMMODATE LARGE CHANGES IN SALINITY; THEY SURVIVE AND THRIVE IN OSMOTICALLY DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS ESTUARIES. EURYHALINITY IS AN EXTRAORDINARY AND IMPORTANT FORM OF PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY. COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS THAT INTEGRATE PHYSIOLOGICAL, TRANSCRIPTOMIC, AND STRUCTURAL GENOMIC INFORMATION, WILL BE USED TO REVEAL THE MECHANISTIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS EURYHALINITY. THE FUNDULUS GENUS OF KILLIFISH INCLUDES MANY SPECIES OF EURYHALINE ESTUARINE SPECIALISTS. MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT RADIATIONS INTO FRESH WATER HAVE ALSO RESULTED IN REPEATED LOSSES OF EURYHALINITY. PHYSIOLOGICAL CHALLENGE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE USED, WITHIN A PHYLOGENETIC-COMPARATIVE FRAMEWORK WHERE INDEPENDENTLY EVOLVED LOSSES OF PLASTICITY IN THREE CLADES PROVIDE REPLICATED OPPORTUNITIES TO INFER THE MECHANISMS THAT SUPPORT PLASTICITY THAT IS ANCESTRALLY RETAINED. EXPERIMENTS WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EURYHALINITY IS UNDERPINNED BY GENE REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY MAINTAINED AND CONSTRAINED BY NATURAL SELECTION. THIS WORK WILL ILLUMINATE THE MECHANISTIC BASIS OF A TRAIT THAT IS BOTH PHYSIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT, AND IMPORTANT IN THE HISTORY OF VERTEBRATE DIVERSIFICATION.

BROADLY, THIS WILL BE USEFUL IN MANY AREAS OF CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE, AND THE MONTEMORE GROUP WILL RELEASE USER-FRIENDLY CODE AND MODELS TO ALLOW OTHER RESEARCH GROUPS TO EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGE THE FRAMEWORK. DR. MONTEMORE IS ALSO ADVISING THE LOCAL CHAPTER OF THE SOCIETY FOR HISPANIC ENGINEERS, AND WORKING WITH LOUISIANA DOW CHEMICAL TO PROVIDE WORKSHOPS AND MENTORSHIP FOR THE MEMBERSHIP. ADDITIONALLY, DR. MONTEMORE IS ADVISING A NUMBER OF UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS, INCLUDING SEVERAL FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. THE NEW MACHINE LEARNING ARCHITECTURE THAT DR. MONTEMORE AND HIS GROUP WILL DEVELOP HERE IS DESIGNED BASED ON CHEMICAL PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS THE EXISTENCE OF ELEMENTS AS DISCRETE ENTITIES (AND NOT AS PART OF A CONTINUOUS SPACE). BRIEFLY, THE ARCHITECTURE USES LATENT (I.E., INTERMEDIATE) VARIABLES TO PARTIALLY DECOUPLE DIFFERENT GUESTS AND DIFFERENT HOST ELEMENTS, WHICH GREATLY SIMPLIFIES THE LEARNING TASK FOR EACH SUBMODEL. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM MOST SCREENING APPROACHES, WHICH USE OFF-THE-SHELF ML MODELS TO MAP CONTINUOUS FEATURES ONTO A TARGET VARIABLE AND MUST LEARN CHEMICAL PRINCIPLES DURING FITTING. THE ARCHITECTURE IS WELL-SUITED TO HANDLING HETEROGENOUS DATA SETS, SUCH AS A MIXTURE OF COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA. IT ALSO DOES NOT REQUIRE VERY LARGE DATA SETS, IN CONTRAST TO DEEP-LEARNING APPROACHES. THE MODELS ARE OFTEN INTERPRETABLE, AS PREDICTIONS CAN BE EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF LATENT VARIABLES OR HOST FEATURES. FINALLY, THE ARCHITECTURE IS WELL-SUITED TO TRANSFER LEARNING, WHICH USES A PRE-TRAINED MODEL TO ACCELERATE THE CREATION OF NEW MODELS. IN SUMMARY, THIS ARCHITECTURE HARNESSES FUNDAMENTAL CHEMICAL PRINCIPLES, ESPECIALLY THOSE PRESENT IN APPLICATIONS INVOLVING GUEST-HOST CHEMICAL BONDING, TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF MATERIALS SCREENING. OVERALL, THE PRIMARY BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SPEEDUP IN MATERIALS SCREENING BY ALLOWING REUSABILITY, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF MORE SOPHISTICATED, EFFECTIVE SCREENING BY PREDICTING MULTIPLE QUANTITIES.

ONE OF THE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES OF CELLULAR STRESS IS THE PRODUCTION AND SECRETION OF DANGER-ASSOCIATED MOLECULAR PATTERNS (DAMPS). THE DAMPS, INCLUDING HIGH-MOBILITY GROUP BOX PROTEIN 1 (HMGB1) AND HEAT-SHOCK PROTEIN 70 (HSP70), INDUCE INFLAMMATION IN MAMMALS BY INTERACTING WITH PATTERN-RECOGNITION RECEPTOR PROTEINS (PROTEINS CAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING DAMP MOLECULES). EARLIER STUDIES PROVIDE EVIDENCE ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS TO PROTEINS IN THE SECRETION OF HMGB1 BY STRESSED CELLS.

THE PROJECT WILL ALSO DEVELOP NUMERICAL AND ALGORITHMIC APPROACHES THAT WILL CONNECT ABSTRACT METHODS IN ANALYSIS WITH PRACTICAL QUESTIONS OF NETWORK SCIENCE, DATA SCIENCE, AND OTHER AREAS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS. FOR EXAMPLE, TOOLS DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT FOR THE STUDY OF NETWORK SCIENCE MAY BE USEFUL FOR THE MODELING, PREDICTION, AND MITIGATION OF THE SPREAD OF EPIDEMICS.

THE PROJECT WILL SUPPORT THE INVOLVEMENT OF FACULTY, POSTDOCS, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, WORKING ON A DIVERSE RANGE OF TOPICS IN ANALYSIS, APPLIED MATHEMATICS, AND NETWORK SCIENCE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH GROUP. A KEY ASPECT IN THE STUDY OF SPREADING PHENOMENA ON A NETWORK IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERCONNECTEDNESS, I.E., THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS, REPRESENTED BY NODES WITHIN THE NETWORK, INTERACT WITH AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER NODES. CLASSICALLY, IN THE QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF SPREADING PROCESSES AMONG SUBPOPULATIONS, RESEARCHERS HAVE USED MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF A SHORTEST PATH (TO MEASURE HOW FAR ONE MUST TRAVEL) OR THE SIZE OF MINIMUM CUTS (TO CAPTURE THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PATHWAYS AVAILABLE). THE NOTION OF EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE, WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE THEORY OF ELECTRICAL NETWORKS, PROVIDES A NEEDED COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES, BALANCING SHORTNESS OF PATHS WITH VARIETY OF PATHWAYS. IN A SENSE, ELECTRICITY IS ABLE TO FIND MANY OPTIMAL ROUTES AND THUS YIELDS INSIGHTS INTO THE INTRINSIC STRUCTURE OF NETWORKS. FROM A MATHEMATICAL POINT OF VIEW, ELECTRICAL CURRENT HAS DEEP CONNECTIONS TO RANDOM WALKS AND TO CLASSICAL DIFFUSION PROCESSES. IN PREVIOUS WORK, THE PIS AND THEIR COLLABORATORS HAVE DEVELOPED THE THEORY OF P-MODULUS ON NETWORKS, WHICH UNIFIES IN A SINGLE FRAMEWORK THREE CLASSICAL MEASURES: SHORTEST PATHS, MINCUTS, AND EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE. THE CONCEPT OF P-MODULUS ORIGINATED IN COMPLEX ANALYSIS, BUT WHEN APPLIED IN THE STUDY OF NETWORKS BECOMES AN EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE TOOL THAT CAN MEASURE THE RICHNESS OF MANY DIFFERENT FAMILIES OF OBJECTS IN MULTIPLE WAYS.

CONVENTIONAL DETERMINATION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND TRADITIONAL COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES ARE UNSUCCESSFUL WITH MANY TYPES OF PROTEINS, SUCH AS MEMBRANE PROTEINS, PROTEINS THAT ARE HARD TO CRYSTALLIZE, AND MACROMOLECULAR PROTEINS. CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (CRYO-EM) IS A RELATIVELY NEW BIOPHYSICS TECHNIQUE WITH THE CAPABILITY TO GENERATE VOLUMETRIC IMAGES OF MACROMOLECULAR COMPLEXES AND ENSEMBLES LIKE RIBOSOMES AND VIRAL CAPSIDS.

THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE A NOVEL IDEA TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE IMAGE AND BUILD VOLUME COMPONENTS USING A GEOMETRIC GRAPH MODEL THAT CAN DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEM. THE VOLUME COMPONENTS WILL BE ANALYZED AND CLASSIFIED TO IDENTIFY THE SECONDARY STRUCTURE ELEMENTS (SSES) OF PROTEINS USING ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING AND GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE VOLUME COMPONENTS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS IN A FULLY AUTOMATIC FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY THE SPATIAL INFORMATION OF THE SSES. THE PROJECT HAS THREE OBJECTIVES:1) BUILD A NEW MATHEMATICAL MODEL BASED ON GEOMETRICAL GRAPH THEORY TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF CRYO-EM IMAGES. 2) DEVELOP EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND OTHER MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES, TO PROCESS, ANALYZE, AND EXTRACT THE SSES FROM THE VOLUMETRIC IMAGES OF PROTEIN MACROMOLECULE. 3) INTEGRATE THE NEW METHODS WITH AN EXISTING VISUALIZATION AND MODELING PLATFORM FOR MOLECULES LIKE CHIMERA.

THIS RESEARCH WILL REVISIT THE POTENTIAL FIELD NAVIGATION METHOD USING DEEP LEARNING-BASED 3D SEMANTIC REASONING TOOLS PAIRED WITH SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING FROM MOTION FEEDBACK TO PROVIDE A FRESH PERSPECTIVE ON ACTIVE PERCEPTION FOR ROBOTS. THE SEMANTIC NAVIGATION METHOD CONTAINS THREE MAIN COMPONENTS: (I) A SEMANTIC VECTOR FIELD PREDICTION NETWORK TO MAP RAW SENSOR DATA TO SEMANTIC FEATURES AND MAP SEMANTIC FEATURES TO NAVIGATION SIGNALS; (II) A PRE-TRAINING SCHEME THAT TRANSFERS PRIOR KNOWLEDGE FROM AN OBSERVATION DATABASE AND EXPERT DEMONSTRATIONS TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM; AND (III) A SEMANTICALLY-GUIDED EXPLORATION SCHEME TO ENABLE THE ROBOT TO TAKE CALCULATED RISKS WHILE GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT THE SURROUNDINGS. THE METHOD WILL INITIALLY BE EVALUATED ON THE PHYSICS-BASED MSU AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE SIMULATOR (MAVS) WHICH HAS THE CAPABILITY OF SIMULATING ROBOT OPERATION UNDER CHALLENGING TERRAIN AND WEATHER. FINALLY, FIELD EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT THE ONE-OF-A-KIND OFF-ROAD PROVING GROUND AT MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY. THIS PROJECT IS SUPPORTED BY THE CROSS-DIRECTORATE FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH IN ROBOTICS PROGRAM, JOINTLY MANAGED AND FUNDED BY THE DIRECTORATES FOR ENGINEERING (ENG) AND COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (CISE).

HOWEVER, THESE PHYSICS-BASED IMAGING METHODS CURRENTLY REQUIRE A LONG PROCESSING TIME AND AT TIMES ENCOUNTER RECONSTRUCTION ERRORS, HINDERING THEM FROM BEING WIDELY USED IN TIME-SENSITIVE USCT APPLICATIONS (E.G., BRAIN AND BREAST IMAGING). TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS, THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE TWO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED APPROACHES TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE RECONSTRUCTION SPEED AND THE QUALITY OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART USCT TECHNOLOGIES. A FASTER AND MORE POWERFUL USCT SYSTEM WILL POTENTIALLY LEAD TO SOCIETAL BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED MEDICAL OUTCOMES, REDUCED RISKS, HIGHER PATIENT SATISFACTION, AND REDUCED HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE COLLABORATIVE TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS WILL ACTIVELY RECRUIT AND MENTOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WITH DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS RESEARCH, REACH OUT TO K-12 EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS TO CREATE STUDENT INTEREST IN DATA SCIENCE, COMPUTING, AND STEM FIELDS, INCORPORATE THE FINDINGS INTO CLASS MODULES, AND DISSEMINATE THE TECHNOLOGY AND FINDINGS TO THE PUBLIC. THIS GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE TWO OPEN-SOURCE, HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING (HPC)-ENABLED, AND DEEP LEARNING (DL)-BASED FRAMEWORKS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE RECONSTRUCTION SPEED AND THE QUALITY OF FULL WAVEFORM INVERSION (FWI)-BASED USCT. FWI TECHNIQUES HAVE RECENTLY ENABLED USCT IN THE RECONSTRUCTION OF DETAILED QUANTITATIVE MATERIAL/TISSUE PARAMETERS, BUT THEY HAVE A SLOW RECONSTRUCTION SPEED AND A HIGH-COMPUTATIONAL COST.

RAPID PATIENT SCREENING CAN BE ACHIEVED USING THIS METHOD. THE SECOND DL APPROACH LEVERAGES PHYSICS-GUIDED, CYCLE-CONSISTENCE IN BOTH TRAINING AND ITS APPLICATION TO PROVIDE EXTRAORDINARY, DETAILED RECONSTRUCTION. THE SECOND METHOD REDUCES THE RELIANCE ON GROUND TRUTH MODELS IN TRAINING, ALLEVIATES THE DEPENDENCE OF INITIAL MODELS, AND UTILIZES THE PURPOSELY-BUILT COMPUTING HARDWARE FOR DL ACCELERATION AND HENCE CAN A) LOWER THE FALSE-POSITIVE RATES WHILE REDUCING UNNECESSARY EXTRA TESTS/BIOPSIES AND B) DECREASE THE FALSE NEGATIVES TO ENABLE EARLY DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT. THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS WILL BE DERIVED FOR BOTH APPROACHES. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS SUCH AS FRAMEWORK DESIGNING/TUNING AND THE STUDIES OF SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS (E.G., INFLUENCES OF INITIAL MODELS AND FORWARD MODELING ERRORS) WILL BE GENERATED AND DISSEMINATED. A CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES HPC/GPU-ENABLED IMAGING DATA GENERATION AND TRAINING FRAMEWORKS AND TWO CLINICALLY RELEVANT DATABASES SUITABLE FOR DL-BASED USCT STUDIES WILL BE CREATED AND MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. THE FRAMEWORK BUILDING PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACHES DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE AN EFFICIENT, SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO APPLYING DEEP LEARNING-BASED TECHNIQUES IN A SCALABLE AND PARALLEL MANNER, THEREBY ACCELERATING BROADER DL-RELATED TOPICS IN ULTRASOUND IMAGING, PHOTOACOUSTIC TOMOGRAPHY, X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY, RADAR TECHNOLOGIES, GEOPHYSICS, AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING.

FOR LARGE SECTIONS OF THE U.S., AN INCREASE AND INTENSIFICATION IN THESE EXTREME HYDROCLIMATE EVENTS ARE PREDICTED. PRECISE, ACCURATE, EARLY, AND ACTIONABLE FORECASTS OF THESE HAZARDS ARE NEEDED TO SAVE LIVES, PROTECT PROPERTY, AND SUSTAIN COMMERCE NEEDS. THE HYDROLOGIC FORECASTING RESEARCH COMMUNITY IS RESPONDING WITH NEW IDEAS, TECHNIQUES, AND TOOLS DRIVEN BY RECENT ADVANCES IN DATA SCIENCE, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI), AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML). RAPID AND EFFECTIVE TRANSLATION OF THESE RESEARCH ADVANCES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED IN WATER SYSTEM OPERATIONS TO HELP IMPROVE WATER HAZARD RESPONSES AND PLANNING. THESE ADVANCES MUST BE DEVELOPED AND INCORPORATED WITH THE OPERATIONAL WEATHER/WATER FORECASTING COMMUNITY AND THE BUSINESSES, INDUSTRY, AND THE PUBLIC THAT DEPEND ON THEM. SIMULTANEOUSLY, GRADUATE STUDENTS' TRAINING REQUIRES GREATER INTER- AND TRANSDISCIPLINARY CURRICULUM INCLUSION. THIS CHANGE IN TRAINING WILL ALLOW THESE FUTURE WATER PROFESSIONALS AND LEADERS IN WATER SCIENCE TO COMPREHEND THE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH ADVANCES AND DEVELOP SKILLS TO EFFECTIVELY TRANSLATE THEM INTO FORECAST AND DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORKS USED IN OPERATIONAL SETTINGS. THIS NSF RESEARCH TRAINEESHIP (NRT) PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE MULTIFACETED AND INTEGRATED NEEDS OF RESEARCHERS, FORECASTERS, AND USERS OF FORECASTS, BY LAUNCHING A UNIQUE HYDROLOGIC SCIENCE PROGRAM FOCUSING ON THE CRITICAL LINKAGE OF RESEARCH TO OPERATIONS, OR R2O. THE PROGRAM OF STUDY WILL BE CO-PRODUCED WITH THOSE WORKING IN THE WATER PREDICTION COMMUNITY TO GENERATE A PIPELINE OF INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS CAPABLE OF DIAGNOSING WATER-HAZARD FORECASTING NEEDS.

THE TRAINING PROGRAM FEATURES UNIQUE MODALITIES, CONTENT, AND DELIVERY TO BUILD COMPETENCY THROUGH TEAM SCIENCE, CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING, CO-PRODUCTION, AND ITERATIVE SELF-REFLECTION. INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS INCLUDE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDY TOURS, MOCK OPERATIONAL FORECASTING, PRACTICAL LABS, ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS, MIXED MENTORING, EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, INTERNSHIPS, BROAD-SCALE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM BUILDING, AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. GRADUATES OF THE PROGRAM WILL BRING TO THE HYDROLOGIC FORECASTING WORKFORCE A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF ATTRIBUTES. THE FIRST TWO ARE: (1) DEEP DISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE IN HYDROLOGIC SCIENCE COUPLED WITH (2) COMPREHENSIVE SKILLS SPANNING THE CUTTING EDGE OF AI AND ML, AND THE USE OF ADVANCED INDUSTRY-STANDARD SOFTWARE. THIRD AND FOURTH ARE: (3) A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEX HYDROLOGIC FORECASTING AND DECISION-MAKING SYSTEM PAIRED WITH (4) THE COMPETENCIES TO BE THOUGHT LEADERS IN THE HYDROLOGIC FORECASTING COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE. TRAINEES WILL ACCELERATE RESEARCH ADVANCES IN THREE FOCAL AREAS: (1) CREATING NEW DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOWS TO CHARACTERIZE MULTI-SCALE GEOPHYSICAL AND CLIMATE DRIVERS OF HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES; (2) ADVANCING MODELS AND PREDICTIVE TOOLS TO REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY OF HYDROLOGIC PREDICTION; AND (3) IMPROVING THE COMMUNICATION OF FORECAST PRODUCTS FOR PRACTICAL OPERATIONS.

A MAJOR TREND OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES IN THE 21ST CENTURY IS THEIR TRANSITION FROM QUANTITATIVE, PHENOMENOLOGICAL, AND DESCRIPTIVE TO QUANTITATIVE, ANALYTICAL, AND PREDICTIVE. FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES THAT HINDER THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH IS THE CENTRAL THEME OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, ARE THEIR TREMENDOUS STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY AND EXCESSIVELY LARGE DATASETS. THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS GRAND CHALLENGES IN UNDERSTANDING THE BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIP FROM MASSIVE DATASETS BY INTRODUCING NEW CONCEPTS IN GRAPH THEORY AND DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY. THE RESULTS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL OPEN A NEW DIRECTION AND FOSTER SIMILAR APPROACHES IN BIOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS. THE GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE TRAINING IN DATA ANALYSIS, BIOLOGICAL MODELING, AND ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT FROM THIS PROJECT. IN ADDITION, NOVEL MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORKS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE SOFTWARE PACKAGES TO ENSURE EXTENSIVE USAGE BY THE COMMUNITY OF RESEARCHERS THROUGHOUT BIOLOGY, COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND MATHEMATICS. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP NEW SPECTRAL GRAPH THEORY AND DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY-BASED APPROACHES TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE CURRENT PRACTICE IN BIOMOLECULAR DATA ANALYSIS AND MODELING. FIRST, INVESTIGATORS WILL INTRODUCE MULTISCALE WEIGHTED COLORED ALGEBRAIC GRAPHS (SPECTRAL GRAPHS) TO REDUCE THE STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY OF BIOMOLECULAR DATA. THESE METHODS WILL BE TAILORED FOR VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, SUCH AS PROTEIN BINDING TO PROTEIN, LIGAND, DNA, AND RNA, PROTEIN FOLDING STABILITY CHANGES UPON MUTATION, DRUG TOXICITY, SOLVATION, SOLUBILITY, AND PARTITION COEFFICIENT. SECONDLY, INVESTIGATORS WILL CONSTRUCT LOW-DIMENSIONAL ELEMENT INTERACTIVE MANIFOLDS FOR THE FIRST TIME TO PROPERLY ENCODE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION. THESE METHODS WILL BE CAREFULLY INTEGRATED WITH ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING OR DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO UNCOVER BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS. FINALLY, INVESTIGATORS WILL EXTENSIVELY VALIDATE THE PROPOSED METHODS ON A VARIETY OF DATASETS, OPTIMIZE THESE MATHEMATICAL LEARNING STRATEGIES USING PARALLEL AND GPU ARCHITECTURES, AND DEVELOP USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE PACKAGES OR ONLINE SERVERS FOR RESEARCHERS WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE TRAINING IN MATHEMATICS AND MACHINE LEARNING.

THE RESEARCH TEAM CREATES ISOLATED CLUSTERS CONSISTING OF AN OXYGEN MOLECULE AND AN ORGANIC OR BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT MOLECULE. EXCITING THE CLUSTERS USING VISIBLE OR ULTRAVIOLET LASER LIGHT PRODUCES OXYGEN SPECIES THAT ARE DETECTED USING MASS SPECTROMETRY AND A TECHNIQUE CALLED VELOCITY MAP IMAGING (VMI) IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE ENERGY RELEASED DURING THE REACTION. BY ANALYZING THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA, THE TEAM SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE ORGANIC MOLECULE INFLUENCES THE RATIO OF DIFFERENT OXYGEN SPECIES FORMED FROM THE IRRADIATED COMPLEXES, WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON CLUSTERS LEADING TO HIGHLY REACTIVE OXYGEN MOLECULES FORMED IN THE LOWEST EXCITED STATE, CALLED SINGLET OXYGEN. SINGLET OXYGEN IS A POTENT OXIDIZING SPECIES THAT HAS APPLICATIONS IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER USING PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY (PDT) AND IN THE DISINFECTION OF WATER. THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THE WORK INCLUDE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THESE APPLICATIONS BASED ON NEW DEVELOPMENTS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SINGLET OXYGEN PRODUCTION USING VISIBLE LIGHT. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROJECT PREPARES UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH STUDENTS FOR CAREERS IN SCIENCE BY GIVING THEM HANDS-ON TRAINING IN ADVANCED RESEARCH METHODS. THE PARSONS RESEARCH TEAM WILL USE SUPERSONIC EXPANSION TO FORM WEAKLY BOUND COMPLEXES BETWEEN MOLECULAR OXYGEN AND HIGH MOLECULAR-WEIGHT ORGANIC CHROMOPHORES. THE RESULTING SUPRAMOLECULAR COMPLEXES WILL BE EXCITED WITH LIGHT RANGING BETWEEN 213 AND 680 NM IN ORDER TO PROBE THE WAVELENGTH-DEPENDENT PHOTOCHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION MECHANISM. DEPENDING ON THE ENERGY OF THE TRIPLET STATE IN THE CHROMOPHORE AND THE EXCITATION ENERGY, THE PHOTOEXCITED COMPLEX MAY DISSOCIATE DIRECTLY TO FORM SINGLET OXYGEN MOLECULES, SINGLET O2, OR THROUGH COMPETING PRODUCT CHANNELS THAT RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF EITHER TRIPLET OXYGEN ATOMS, O(3P), OR SINGLET O2 DUE TO AN AVOIDED CROSSING BETWEEN TWO EXCITED STATES. THE TEAM WILL PROBE EITHER THE SINGLET O2 OR O(3P) PRODUCTS USING RESONANCE-ENHANCED MULTIPHOTON IONIZATION (REMPI) COUPLED WITH MASS SPECTROMETRY AND VELOCITY MAP ION IMAGING (VMI). THE COMBINATION OF REMPI SPECTROSCOPY AND VMI IDENTIFIES THE INTERNAL STATE OF THE OXYGEN PRODUCT. BY ANALYZING CHANGES IN BRANCHING BETWEEN PRODUCT CHANNELS DUE TO THE CHROMOPHORE TRIPLET-STATE ENERGY AND THE EXCITATION ENERGY, THE TEAM WILL EXAMINE THE SINGLET O2 FORMATION MECHANISM AND THE ROLE PLAYED BY A HYPOTHESIZED AVOIDED CROSSING.

AT ITS BEST, AQUAPONICS ALLOWS LOCAL PEOPLE TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN FRESH FISH AND PRODUCE IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER: THE WASTEWATER FROM THE FISH IS USED TO PROVIDE WATER AND FERTILIZER TO THE PLANTS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL BARRIERS THAT HAVE HINDERED ADOPTION OF AQUAPONICS BY MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS LIVING IN FOOD DESERTS. BARRIERS INCLUDE 1) SYSTEMS THAT ARE PRONE TO INSTABILITY WITHOUT ADVANCED TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE, 2) FISH AND PRODUCE QUALITY THAT DO NOT MEET CONSUMER QUALITY DEMANDS (E.G. MUDDY FISH FLAVOR), AND 3) FOOD SAFETY ISSUES GIVEN THAT PATHOGENS IN THE FISH WASTEWATER CAN CONTAMINATE THE VEGETABLES. FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE THREE ISSUES WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE AQUAPONICS SYSTEMS (AND THE CORRESPONDING NUTRITIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS) OUT OF REACH OF MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW AQUAPONICS DESIGN DECISIONS AFFECT STABILITY, PATHOGEN DYNAMICS, AND PRODUCT QUALITY. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT ALGAL BIOFLOC AND DECOUPLED SYSTEMS WILL EXCEED THE PERFORMANCE METRICS OF BACTERIA-CENTRIC BIOFLOC AND COUPLED SYSTEMS (85% OF CURRENT SYSTEMS) IN TERMS OF 1) SYSTEM STABILITY AND EASE OF OPERATION, 2) NUTRITIONAL AND FLAVOR PROFILES, AND 3) PATHOGEN MANAGEMENT WHEN PLACED IN THE HANDS OF NOVICE USERS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALLOW RIGOROUS TESTING OF INTEGRATING ALGAL- BIOFLOC AND DECOUPLED PLANT PRODUCTION INTO SMALL-SCALE AQUAPONICS SYSTEMS, BOTH INDEPENDENTLY AND IN COMBINATION. THE TEST SYSTEMS WILL BE OPERATED BY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN EAST ALABAMA (AFTER HANDS-ON TRAINING) IN A SYNERGISTIC SCHOOL-UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIP. THE UNIVERSITY TEAM HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON AQUAPONICS SYSTEMS AND ALGAL-BACTERIAL TREATMENT OF WASTE, AND ENGAGES FREQUENTLY IN EDUCATIONAL AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS WITH NOVICE USERS. THE THREE SPECIFIC RESEARCH AIMS ARE TO: (AIM 1) TEST THE INTEGRATION OF ALGAE AND DECOUPLING INTO BIOFLOC AQUAPONICS TO IMPROVE STABILITY AND EASE OF OPERATION FOR NOVICE USERS (HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS). THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT INTEGRATION OF GREEN ALGAE INTO THE BIOFLOC AND DEPLOYMENT INTO A DECOUPLED AQUAPONICS SYSTEM WILL IMPROVE SYSTEM STABILITY (NITRIFICATION CAPACITY) AND RELIABILITY (PLANT AND FISH SURVIVAL). (AIM 2) DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF ALGAL BIOFLOC TO IMPROVED NUTRITIONAL QUALITY AND FLAVOR PROFILE OF AQUAPONICS PRODUCTS. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT INTEGRATING CHLORELLA ALGAE INTO THE BIOFLOC WILL INCREASE THE OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID PROFILE OF FISH, ANTIOXIDANT CONTENT OF VEGETABLES, AND IMPROVE THE FISH FLAVOR PROFILE BY DISPLACING OPPORTUNISTIC BACTERIA AND CYANOBACTERIA SPECIES THAT GENERATE MUDDY FLAVORS. (AIM 3) QUANTIFY THE IMPACTS OF ALGAL BIOFLOC AND DECOUPLING ON INDICATOR PATHOGENS IN AQUAPONICS. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE PRESENCE OF ALGAL TAXA LIKE CHLORELLA IN THE BIOFLOC AND USE OF DECOUPLED SYSTEMS WILL REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF INDICATOR PATHOGENS. WHILE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS WILL RUN THE DIFFERENT AQUAPONICS SYSTEMS, AUBURN UNIVERSITY AND THE BASHAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE WILL CONDUCT ADVANCED CHEMICAL, MICROBIOLOGICAL, AND GENOMIC ANALYSES OF THE SYSTEMS. STUDENTS, AFTER FORMAL PARENTAL INFORMED CONSENT, WILL EVALUATE SYSTEM EASE-OF-USE AND FLAVOR OF PRODUCTS THROUGH SURVEYS. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF MICROBIAL DYNAMICS IN AQUAPONICS CAN TRANSLATE BROADLY TO OTHER AREAS OF AQUACULTURE, NUTRIENT RECOVERY, AND WASTE MANAGEMENT. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DESIGN CHOICES IMPACT USER EXPERIENCE MAY TRANSLATE TO RESEARCH ON OTHER SCALABLE FOOD PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. THE PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO LEAD TO ENHANCEMENT OF EDUCATION OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT PARTICIPANTS WHO LIVE IN LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH LIMITED FOOD ACCESS. APPROXIMATELY 225 STUDENTS WILL ENGAGE IN HANDS-ON LEARNING BY OPERATING THE AQUAPONICS SYSTEMS, ALLOWING THEM TO LEARN AND APPLY KNOWLEDGE OF AGRICULTURE, BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, NUTRITION, AND ENGINEERING. POTENTIALLY, THESE STUDENTS CAN IMPACT THE FUTURE OF SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION: THE SKILLS THAT THEY LEARN SHOULD EXTEND TO A WIDE RANGE OF CAREER AND EDUCATION PATHWAYS.

PEOPLE WITH WALKING PROBLEMS DUE TO AGING OR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS SUCH AS STROKE AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE OFTEN PARTICIPATE IN GAIT TRAINING THERAPY TO IMPROVE THEIR WALKING ABILITY. CURRENT GAIT TRAINING METHODS PRIMARILY FOCUS ON IMPROVING LEG MOVEMENTS AND OVERLOOK THE ROLE OF ARM MOVEMENT, EVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLE DO NOT DEMONSTRATE APPROPRIATE ARM SWING. WALKING IS A COMPLEX SKILL REQUIRING HIGHLY COORDINATED LEG AND ARM MOVEMENTS. ARM SWING THEN IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF WALKING THAT IMPACTS STABILITY, BALANCE, AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. TO IMPROVE WALKING, A WHOLE-BODY APPROACH SHOULD BE ADOPTED, ONE THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HOW ALL FOUR LIMBS WORK TOGETHER IN GAIT PRODUCTION. THIS EARLY CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (CAREER) PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH A NOVEL FRAMEWORK FOR EMPLOYING APPROPRIATE ARM SWING IN GAIT TRAINING TO CREATE MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS WITH ENDURING IMPROVEMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH WALKING DIFFICULTIES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY QUANTIFYING NORMAL ARM SWING WHILE CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS AGE AND WALKING SPEED, AND THEN CREATING NOVEL APPROACHES USING WEARABLE ROBOTIC DEVICES TO INDUCE NORMAL ARM SWING DURING WALKING. THE USE OF THESE ROBOTIC DEVICES WILL ENHANCE GAIT REHABILITATION PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SOCIETY GIVEN THAT THE ABILITY TO WALK IS CRUCIAL FOR DAILY LIVING ACTIVITIES, AND MANY INDIVIDUALS, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, HAVE DIFFICULTY IN WALKING EFFICIENTLY. THE EDUCATION PLAN WILL ENGAGE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES, WHO ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN RESEARCH USING ASSISTIVE ROBOTIC DEVICES WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO PURSUE FURTHER EDUCATION AND CAREERS IN THIS FIELD AND HELP WITH STUDENT RETENTION. THE RESEARCH GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE GAIT TRAINING APPROACH BY INDUCING WHOLE-BODY RESPONSES DURING WALKING. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO EXPLOIT INTERLIMB NEURAL COUPLING AND UTILIZE ARM SWING TO ENHANCE GAIT REHABILITATION. TWO MAJOR APPROACHES FOR INCORPORATING APPROPRIATE ARM SWING INTO GAIT TRAINING WILL BE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE HOW INTERLIMB COUPLING CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE KEY PARAMETERS SUCH AS COORDINATION, SYMMETRY, VARIABILITY, AND WALKING SPEED. IN ONE APPROACH, ARM-SWING PATTERNS GENERATED IN REAL-TIME BY A NOVEL MODEL USING THIGH AND SHANK KINEMATIC DATA WILL BE UTILIZED IN WEARABLE ROBOTIC DEVICES. THESE DEVICES WILL ATTEMPT TO INDUCE CORRECT ARM MOVEMENT IN COORDINATION WITH LEG MOVEMENTS AT VARIOUS WALKING SPEEDS WHILE GAIT PARAMETERS ARE RECORDED. IN THE SECOND APPROACH, ARM SWING WILL BE ALTERED BY ROBOTIC DEVICES TO MODULATE THE AMPLITUDE AND FREQUENCY OF LEG MOVEMENTS TO IMPROVE GAIT PARAMETERS. TWO NOVEL WEARABLE ROBOTIC DEVICES WILL BE CREATED AS RESEARCH TOOLS TO EXAMINE HOW TACTILE AND KINESTHETIC FORCE FEEDBACK METHODS CAN INSTIGATE AND ALTER ARM SWING IN USERS DURING WALKING AT SELF-SELECTED SPEEDS. THE INTERLIMB COUPLING IN EACH APPROACH WILL BE QUANTIFIED BY ANALYZING MUSCLE ACTIVITY USING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS INTERMUSCULAR COHERENCE ANALYSIS. PARTICIPANTS IN THESE STUDIES WILL INCLUDE HEALTHY YOUNG AND OLDER ADULTS, OLDER ADULTS WITH SLOW GAIT SPEED, AND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SUFFERED A STROKE AND WALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT ARE ABLE TO WALK WITHOUT AN ASSISTIVE DEVICE.

COLLAGEN IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO TENDON STRENGTH. HOWEVER, MUCH IS UNKNOWN ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THAT INFLUENCE COLLAGEN FORMATION DURING NORMAL TENDON DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, SEVERAL TYPES OF ENZYMES CROSSLINK AND STABILIZE COLLAGEN IN TENDONS, BUT HOW CELLS COORDINATE THE PRODUCTION OF THESE COLLAGEN CROSSLINKING ENZYMES DURING TENDON DEVELOPMENT IS UNKNOWN.

THIS SYNERGISTIC RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROGRAM AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE DEVICE PHYSICS OF A NOVEL SPIN FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTOR (SPIN FET) WHILE BROADENING THE PARTICIPATION OF DEAF, HISPANICS, AND NATIVE AMERICANS IN NANOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. THE WORK WILL BE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL STUDY TO FOCUS ON THE FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SPIN FETS THAT LEVERAGE SCREW DISLOCATIONS IN SINGLE SRYSTAL-CRYSTALLINE SEMICONDUCTORS. A SCREW DISLOCATION IS A TYPE OF CRYSTAL DEFECT THAT PROMISES TO ACT AS A SUITABLE CHANNEL FOR A SPIN TRANSISTOR THAT OPERATES AT VARIABLE TEMPERATURES (I.E., ROOM TEMPERATURE AND ABOVE) FOR COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND MILITARY APPLICATIONS. THE IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES GENERATED IN THIS PROJECT WILL POTENTIALLY ACCELERATE VERY-LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATION OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE SPINTRONIC DEVICES, WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE PRACTICAL REALIZATION OF HYBRID AND ENTIRELY SPIN-BASED CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM COMPUTERS.

THE RESEARCH EFFORT ENCOMPASSES THREE STRONGLY OVERLAPPING INTELLECTUAL THREADS: (I) FABRICATION AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF SPIN FETS EMBEDDED SCREW DISLOCATIONS(SDS); (II) CHARACTERIZATION OF GATE-TUNABLE SPIN TRANSPORT; (III) INVESTIGATION OF PROCESS-STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FABRICATED SPIN FETS. THE OPERATION OF THE PROPOSED SPIN FET IS BASED ON CONTROLLING THE SPIN LIFETIME IN SCREW DISLOCATIONS CHANNELS USING A GATE VOLTAGE. TWO OPPOSITE ALIGNED SPIN-SELECTIVE FERROMAGNETIC/SEMICONDUCTOR CONTACTS WILL BE PLACED AT THE TWO ENDS OF A SCREW DISLOCATION.

THE RATIO BETWEEN THE SPIN LIFETIME AND THE RELAXATION TIME WILL DETERMINE THE ON/OFF RATIO OF THE DEVICE. SPIN FETS DESIGNS THAT RELY ON CONTROLLING SPIN LIFETIMES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BEFORE. HOWEVER, THESE DEVICES HAVE NOT FOUND PRACTICAL USES DUE TO THE REQUIREMENT OF LARGE (>100 MS) SPIN RELAXATION TIMES AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. SCREW DISLOCATION CHANNELS CAN OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION OWING TO A UNIQUE FORM OF SPIN-ORBIT COUPLING (SOC) THAT PROMISES TO INCREASE SPIN LIFETIMES EVEN AT HIGH TEMPERATURES, THEREBY ENABLING THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED SPIN FET DESIGN. BRIEFLY, THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN RASHBA AND DRESSELHAUS SOC IN SCREW DISLOCATIONS OF MATERIALS WITH MEDIUM IONICITY MAKES SPIN POLARIZATION SCATTERING RESISTANT. THE TECHNICAL PLAN RELIES ON THE CONTROLLED SYNTHESIS OF A SCREW DISLOCATIONS NETWORK BY ANNEALING ULTRA-COMPLIANT TWISTED BICRYSTALS OR TWO SINGLE-CRYSTALLINE NANOMEMBRANES (NMS) THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY OVERLAYED WITH A CONTROLLED TWIST ANGLE. NMS WILL PROVIDE MORE UNIFORM INTERFACIAL BONDING THAN THEIR BULK COUNTERPART, EXPAND THE PALETTE OF SEMICONDUCTOR HOSTS OF SCREW DISLOCATIONS TO INCLUDE EPITAXIALLY GROWN ALLOYS, AND INCREASE THE ON/OFF RATIO OF THE TRANSISTOR BY REDUCING THE TRANSIT TIME OF THE CARRIERS. DISLOCATED NMS WILL BE PROCESSED IN SPIN FETS, AND THE PROCESS-STRUCTURE PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS OF THE DEVICES WILL BE EVALUATED. THE FOCUS WILL BE ON SDS IN SIC NMS AS THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT A FIXED SPIN ORIENTATION, WHICH IS ROBUST AGAINST ALL FORMS OF ELECTRON SCATTERING, CAN BE OBTAINED IN THIS MATERIAL.

THOMPSON OF UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE IS DEVELOPING COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO SIMULATE EXCITED STATE PROCESSES OF RELEVANCE TO METALLO-PHOTOCATALYSIS. METALLO-PHOTOCATALYSIS COMBINES TRANSITION METAL CATALYSIS AND PHOTOREDOX CATALYSIS TO ENABLE NEW MOLECULAR SYNTHESIS APPROACHES. HOWEVER, SEVERAL COMPETING MECHANISMS FOR CATALYST ACTIVATION CAN POTENTIALLY LEAD TO DIFFERENT REACTION PRODUCTS, AND SO COMPUTATIONAL MODELLING IS BENEFICIAL TO ESTABLISH THE RATES OF EXCITED STATE PROCESSES AND DESIGN CATALYTIC SYSTEMS THAT ENHANCE THE DESIRED REACTIVITY. FOR THIS, MODELING CHALLENGES EXIST, INCLUDING: (I) THE SIZE OF THE SYSTEMS INVOLVED, (II) THE NATURE OF THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE OF THESE SYSTEMS AS THESE ARE OFTEN NOT AMENABLE TO CURRENT APPROXIMATIONS EMBODIED IN REDUCED-CPU (CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT) TIME METHODS, AND (III) THEORETICAL FORMALISMS REQUIRING COMPUTATION OF TERMS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO EXTRACT FROM SIMULATION. TO RESOLVE THESE DIFFICULTIES, DR. THOMPSON IS DEVELOPING COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THAT COUPLE TOGETHER LOW-COST APPROXIMATIONS THAT EACH CAPTURE DIFFERENT FEATURES OF THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE. THE AIM IS TO DEVELOP A GENERAL COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM OF MORE ACCURATE APPROACHES THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF PARTITIONING OF THE ELECTRONIC INTERACTIONS TO REDUCE COMPUTATIONAL EFFORTS. THIS PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED EDUCATION PLAN FOCUSING ON PROGRAMMING LITERACY AND SUSTAINABLE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT THAT AIMS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY AND COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR IS ALSO WORKING TO BUILD A FORUM TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CHEMISTRY ENTERPRISE IN LOUISVILLE, KY THROUGH THE DERBY LECTURE SERIES. THIS PROJECT ON RESONANT HARTREE-FOCK INSPIRED DESCRIPTIONS OF EXCITED STATE PROCESSES CONSISTS OF TWO MAIN SCIENTIFIC GOALS. FIRST, THE THOMPSON RESEARCH TEAM IS DEVELOPING ALGORITHMS THAT EXPLORE SELF-CONSISTENT FIELD (SCF) SOLUTION SPACE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SCF FUNCTION LANDSCAPE ENCODES DIFFERENT CORRELATION MECHANISMS. THE METHODS PERMIT ENUMERATION OF SCF SOLUTIONS FROM WHICH A SHORT DETERMINANT EXPANSION CAN BE CHOSEN THAT SPANS RELEVANT CORRELATION MECHANISMS PRESENT IN MOLECULAR SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, THE SCF SOLUTIONS CAN BE USED AS REFERENCES FOR POST-SCF METHODS. SECOND, MODELS THAT OPTIMIZE A DIFFERENT-ORBITALS-FOR-DIFFERENT-CONFIGURATIONS WAVEFUNCTION TO ACCOUNT FOR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CORRELATION MECHANISMS ARE BEING DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED. THE RESULTING WAVEFUNCTION IS BEING USED AS A PLATFORM TO RECOVER REMAINING CORRELATION ENERGY AT REDUCED COMPUTATIONAL COST. THE NEW METHODS WILL BE APPLIED TO THE STUDY OF PHOTO-INDUCED ELECTRON TRANSFER AND EXCITATION ENERGY TRANSFER RATES IN METALLO-PHOTOCATALYTIC SYSTEMS. THESE TOOLS, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE DESIGN OF NEW PHOTOREDOX CATALYST SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES, AN AREA OF GREAT CURRENT INTEREST IN REACTION DEVELOPMENT.

EFFECTIVE THERMAL MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE ESSENTIAL TO COOL THESE DEVICES TO A SAFE TEMPERATURE TO SUSTAIN THEIR HIGH PERFORMANCE. THIN FILM EVAPORATION, BASED ON CONTINUOUS EVAPORATION OF VERY THIN FILMS OF LIQUID COOLANT, IS A PROMISING COOLING STRATEGY DUE TO ITS SIMPLE DESIGN, HIGH COOLING CAPACITY, AND HIGH STABILITY. BY INCORPORATING MICRO/NANO-STRUCTURES SUCH AS MICRO-PILLARS AND NANO-PORES, THE COOLING CAPACITY OF THIN FILM EVAPORATION HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN RECENT YEARS BUT IS STILL MUCH LOWER THAN THEORY PREDICTIONS, DUE TO THE LACK OF FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING, ESPECIALLY THE DETAILED FLOW AND THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS AT MICROSCOPIC AND NANOSCOPIC SCALES.

THE PROJECT SERVES THE NATIONAL INTEREST BY PROMOTING THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE AND ADVANCING PUBLIC HEALTH. THE MPI IS A PROMISING AND NOVEL IMAGING MODALITY BECAUSE IT CAN GENERATE POSITIVE CONTRAST SIGNALS DIRECTLY FROM MNPS WITHOUT USING HARMFUL IONIZING RADIATION. THE MPI HAS UNLIMITED TISSUE PENETRATION DEPTH, LOW BACKGROUND SIGNALS, AND HIGH SENSITIVITY. NEVERTHELESS, THE MPI IS CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS. ONE MAJOR OBSTACLE IS A LACK OF MPI-SPECIFIC MNPS AS TRACERS. HIGH-PERFORMANCE MNPS ARE CRITICAL TO MATERIALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF MPI IN CLINICAL TRANSLATION. THIS PROJECT IS INSPIRED BY PROFESSOR YONGFENG ZHAO?S PILOT STUDY DEMONSTRATING THAT WATER-SOLUBLE MNPS CAN BE SYNTHESIZED IN A CONTINUOUS GROWTH MANNER. THE RESULTING MNPS SHOW HIGH MPI PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISM OF THE CONTINUOUS GROWTH IS STILL UNKNOWN, AND THE CORRELATION BETWEEN WATER-SOLUBLE MNPS AND MPI PERFORMANCE IS NOT ESTABLISHED. ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS WILL ACCELERATE THE DESIGN, SYNTHESIS, AND MANUFACTURING OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE MNPS FOR MPI.

THE RESEARCH PROJECT IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE MPI IS AN EMERGING TRACER IMAGING MODALITY THAT CAN OVERCOME MANY LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING IMAGING TECHNIQUES. THE PROPERTIES OF MNPS DICTATE THEIR SENSITIVITY AND RESOLUTION, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE FURTHER APPLICATION OF MPI. TO ACHIEVE THIS OVERARCHING GOAL, THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO 1) EXPLORE THE CONTINUOUS GROWTH MECHANISM FOR CONTROLLED SYNTHESIS OF WATER-SOLUBLE MNPS; 2) UNRAVEL A LIVING GROWTH PROFILE OF MNPS IN POLYOLS; 3) MANIPULATE THE REACTION PARAMETERS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF WATER-SOLUBLE MNPS; 4) EXPAND THE MECHANISM TO SYNTHESIZE WATER-SOLUBLE MNPS WITH DOPANTS; AND 5) STUDY THE MPI PROPERTIES OF MNPS SYNTHESIZED IN POLYOLS. THIS PROJECT WILL ACCELERATE THE SELECTION, SYNTHESIS, AND MANUFACTURING OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE MNPS FOR MPI.

PARASITES RESPOND IN TURN WITH MODIFICATIONS TO THEIR OWN GENETIC WEAPONRY TO MORE EFFECTIVELY AVOID OR DISABLE HOST DEFENSES. RECENT RESEARCH HAS EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF A THIRD PLAYER IN INFECTIONS, THE HOST?S MICROBIAL ALLIES, WHICH CAN PROVIDE STRONG PROTECTION AGAINST INVADERS. HOWEVER, CENTRAL QUESTION ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES AND EFFECTS OF SYMBIONTS ON HOSTS AND PARASITES REMAIN TO BE ANSWERED. FOR INSTANCE, HOW DO SYMBIONTS TARGET AND DISABLE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARASITES WITHOUT HARMING THE HOST? HOW DO DEFENSIVE GENES INFLUENCE THE BACK-AND-FORTH ?ARMS RACE? BETWEEN HOST DEFENSES AND PARASITE RESISTANCE? A GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ANSWER THESE OPEN QUESTIONS THROUGH MOLECULAR AND GENETIC INVESTIGATIONS OF AN EXEMPLAR SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN THE FRUIT FLY, DROSOPHILA, AND SPIROPLASMA, A BACTERIAL PARTNER THAT DEFENDS IT AGAINST INTERNAL PARASITES. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO COLLABORATE WITH MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND SCHOOL TEACHERS, PROVIDING TRAINING IN BACTERIAL EVOLUTION AND CUTTING-EDGE GENOME SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY WHILE INVESTIGATING SYMBIONT-PARASITE INTERACTIONS IN NATURAL INSECT POPULATIONS. AS RESEARCH ORGANISMS, INSECTS OFFER IDEAL SYSTEMS TO EXPERIMENTALLY INVESTIGATE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE GENES THAT SUPPORT THEM, AND AS POLLINATORS, CONSUMERS, PESTS, AND DISEASE VECTORS, INSECTS ARE DEEPLY CONNECTED TO THEIR NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS, AND TO HUMAN HEALTH AND FOOD SECURITY. THEREFORE, THIS RESEARCH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE IN THE AREAS OF PARASITE-HOST INTERACTIONS, BACTERIAL EVOLUTION, AND INSECT ECOLOGY. CONFLICT BETWEEN PARASITE AND HOST IS A KEY DRIVER OF NATURAL SELECTION, RESHAPING LIFE HISTORY STRATEGIES, IMMUNE SYSTEMS, AND VIRULENCE FACTORS ACROSS ALL BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS. WHILE DEFENSIVE MICROBIAL SYMBIONTS ARE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS FUNDAMENTAL CONTRIBUTORS TO HOST ECOLOGY, THE MOLECULAR EVOLUTIONARY CONTEXT UNDERLYING THEIR PLACE IN THE PARASITE-HOST ARMS RACE IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP THROUGH FUNCTIONAL GENETIC STUDIES OF A MODEL INSECT DEFENSIVE SYMBIOSIS. BACTERIAL TOXINS ENCODED BY SPIROPLASMA HELP DEFEND DROSOPHILA HOSTS AGAINST PARASITIC WASPS AND NEMATODES, AND EXHIBIT RAPID MOLECULAR EVOLUTION, FREQUENT RECOMBINATION, AND CONJUGATIVE MOBILIZATION ACROSS THE SYMBIONT GENUS. MULTIPLE ORIGINS OF RESISTANCE WITHIN WASPS COMPLEMENTS THESE DYNAMIC PATTERNS OF TOXIN EVOLUTION, SUGGESTING ARMS RACE-LIKE COEVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES MAY UNDERLIE SYMBIONT-PARASITE INTERACTIONS.

TO INVESTIGATE HOW THE TEMPERATURE IMPACTS A FUNDAMENTAL ABILITY--THE CHAMELEON?S FEEDING WITH ITS PROJECTILE TONGUE--THIS PROJECT MEASURES THE RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURES EXPERIENCED BY DIFFERENT SPECIES OF AFRICAN CHAMELEONS, HOW THOSE DIFFERENT HABITATS CORRESPOND TO DIFFERENCES IN FEEDING PERFORMANCE, HOW DIFFERENCES IN FEEDING ARE RELATED TO DIFFERENCES IN THE TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY OF THE MUSCLES AND CONNECTIVE TISSUES OF THE TONGUE, AND HOW THOSE DIFFERENCES MIGHT HAVE EVOLVED. IN ADDITION, THIS RESEARCH HARNESSES THE CHARISMATIC NATURE OF CHAMELEONS AND THE CAPTIVATING VISUALS OF HIGH-SPEED VIDEO OF THEIR FEEDING TO ENGAGE AND EDUCATE A BROAD AUDIENCE. IN PARTICULAR, THESE RESULTS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO EDUCATION MODULES DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC K-12 LEARNING OBJECTIVES IN THE BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES. SPECIFICALLY, AS PART OF A CURRICULUM ENHANCEMENT RESOURCE DEVELOPED TO CONNECT SCIENTISTS TO TEACHERS AND CLASSROOMS IN RURAL AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN SOUTH DAKOTA, THIS RESEARCH WILL RESULT IN FREE CURRICULUM MODULES BASED ON SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OCCURRING IN SOUTH DAKOTA?S HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THE SOUTH DAKOTA SCIENCE STANDARDS. IN THE PROCESS, THIS RESEARCH WILL FORM A FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING CONTENT FOR NEW CURRICULA OFFERINGS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE LEVEL THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL LABORATORY MODULES, ORIGINAL CASE STUDY MATERIALS, AND NEW COURSE OFFERINGS. TEMPERATURE EXHIBITS STRONG EFFECTS ON ANIMAL MOVEMENT AND PERFORMANCE THROUGH ITS EFFECT ON MUSCLE CONTRACTILE DYNAMICS. MOVEMENTS POWERED BY THE RECOIL OF ELASTIC TISSUES, HOWEVER, RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE THAN MOVEMENTS POWERED BY MUSCLE CONTRACTION DIRECTLY. THESE SYSTEMS AND THEIR UNDERLYING FUNCTIONAL PROCESSES THEREFORE MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT SELECTION PRESSURES RELATING TO THERMAL SPECIALIZATION TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL COMPARE PATTERNS OF THERMAL SPECIALIZATION IN TWO MOVEMENT TYPES: ELASTIC RECOIL-POWERED TONGUE PROJECTION AND MUSCLE-POWERED TONGUE RETRACTION IN CHAMELEONS. THESE COMPARISONS WILL FOCUS ON EXAMINING THE THERMAL SENSITIVITY OF WHOLE ORGANISM PERFORMANCE AND THE DIFFERENT UNDERLYING MECHANISTIC PROCESSES INVOLVED IN PRODUCING THESE MOVEMENTS (E.G., MOTOR CONTROL, MUSCLE CONTRACTILE PHYSIOLOGY, ANATOMICAL VARIATION) IN CHAMELEONS LIVING IN DIFFERENT THERMAL ENVIRONMENTS. COMBINING ECOLOGICAL WORK IN THE FIELD AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK IN THE LABORATORY, THIS WORK WILL DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOVEMENT UNDERGO THERMAL SPECIALIZATION, AT WHAT MECHANISTIC LEVEL THERMAL SPECIALIZATION OCCURS FOR BOTH MOVEMENT TYPES, WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS DRIVE THESE PATTERNS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH ACCLIMATION AFFECTS PERFORMANCE IN BOTH MOVEMENTS, AND EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS IN THESE PATTERNS. IN THE PROCESS, THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO HOW ANIMALS USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOVEMENT FOR CRITICAL ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS MAY RESPOND TO SHIFTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THESE ADVANCEMENTS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ADAPTATION TO DIFFERING AND CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY TEMPERATURE, WILL IMPACT THE FIELDS OF ECOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE WORK INCLUDES BROAD OUTREACH EFFORTS, EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES, AND SCIENTIFIC PRESENTATIONS AND PUBLICATIONS, WITH RESEARCH TRAINING FOR UNDERGRADUATES, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND A POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER.

THE LIGHT-INITIATED MOVEMENT OF PROTONS HAS MYRIAD CHEMICAL IMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING IN THE HARNESSING OF SOLAR ENERGY. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO STUDY HOW THE CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE MOLECULES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO EXCHANGE PROTONS EFFECTIVELY, INFORMATION THAT WILL BE USED TO DESIGN PHOTO-ACIDS AND PHOTO-BASES FOR TARGETED APPLICATIONS. THE PROJECT WILL BE CONDUCTED BY A TEAM OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, SUPPORTING AN INCLUSIVE RESEARCH CULTURE THAT FOSTERS SCIENCE IDENTITY AND BELONGING IN STUDENTS. LABORATORY MODULES WILL BE CREATED AND EMBEDDED INTO COURSES TO INTRODUCE STUDENTS TO THE FIELD OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY, AND STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME PART OF THE BROADER SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THROUGH COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROJECTS AND MEETINGS. PHOTO-ACIDS AND PHOTO-BASES ALLOW TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL CONTROL OF PROTON DONATION AND ABSTRACTION VIA LIGHT. DESIGNING PHOTO-ACIDS AND PHOTO-BASES FOR DESIRED APPLICATIONS REQUIRES A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE DRIVING FORCES AND SOLVENT PARAMETERS THAT PROMOTE EXCITED STATE PROTON TRANSFER (ESPT).

OTHER FUNDING WAS PROVIDED BY THE MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS PROGRAM IN THE DIVISION OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCES IN THE DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND BY THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR). SINCE THE STONE AGE, HUMANS KNOW THAT MECHANICAL FORCES CAN BE USED TO BEND AND BREAK MATERIALS. YOUNG CHILDREN INTUITIVELY SHAPE PLAYDOUGH, UNAWARE THAT THEY ARE CONTROLLING SHEAR-FORCES WHEN DECIDING TO TEAR OR PINCH THE MATERIAL, WHERE THE DIRECTION OF APPLIED FORCE DEFINES THEIR EFFECTS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF APPLIED MECHANICAL FORCES BECOME MUCH LESS INTUITIVE IF WE ZOOM INTO BIOMOLECULES. IN FACT, CHEMISTRY AT SHEAR FORCES IS QUITE INTRIGUING, WITH RELATIVELY SOFT BONDS BECOMING VERY STRONG DEPENDING ON HOW FORCE IS APPLIED TO THEM. SUCH INTRIGUING BEHAVIOR IS CRUCIAL FOR THE INNER WORKINGS OF ALL CELLS, WHERE PROTEINS ARE OFTEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MECHANICAL FORCES. FREQUENTLY, THE DIRECTIONALITY AND AMPLITUDE OF THESE FORCES CAN REGULATE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. IN THIS PROJECT, THE RESEARCHERS ARE NOT ONLY INVESTIGATING THE INTRIGUING BEHAVIOR OF PROTEINS THAT ARE MECHANOACTIVE, THAT IS, THAT REACT DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON THE FORCES APPLIED ON THEM, BUT ALSO DEVELOPING COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO STUDY THEM WITH ATOMIC DETAIL. PARTICULARLY, MECHANOACTIVE PROTEINS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE SURFACE OF BOTH GOOD AND BAD BACTERIA WILL BE INVESTIGATED TO ELUCIDATE HOW THEY BECOME EXTREMALLY RESILIENT TO SHEAR FORCES AND ALLOW INFECTIONS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN OUR BODIES. ADDITIONALLY, NEW IMMERSIVE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE DEVELOPED TO OBSERVE THESE PROTEINS UNDER SHEAR-FORCE LOAD, POWERING THE ?IMMERSIVE BIOPHYSICS ON THE ROAD? PROGRAM, WHERE TOOLS AND KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT WILL BE TAKEN TO AREAS IN ALABAMA THAT ARE HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM. AN INFLATABLE PROJECTION DOME WILL THEN BE USED TO TEACH THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF LIFE. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CHARACTERIZE, WITH ATOMIC AND SUB-ATOMIC RESOLUTION, THE PROTEIN:PROTEIN INTERACTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REMARKABLE MECHANOSTABILITY OF EXTRACELLULAR PROTEIN COMPLEXES. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT EVOLUTION HAS CREATED GEOMETRICAL ARTIFICES THAT ARE USED BY DIFFERENT PROTEINS TO BECOME STRONGER WHEN UNDER MECHANICAL STRESS, AND ALSO MODULAR AND FLEXIBLE WHEN NEEDED. THIS HYPOTHESIS IS BASED ON PRELIMINARY WORK THAT HAS SHOWN A SIMPLE GEOMETRIC MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR MECHANOSTABILITY, BUT THAT IS CHALLENGING TO BE ACHIEVED AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL. HERE, THE RATIONALE IS THAT UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR DETAILS AT PLAY WILL ALLOW FOR THE MANIPULATION OF MECHANOSTABILITY; FOR GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOLECULES THAT CAN INHIBIT ADHESION PROCESSES; AND FOR PROPOSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TOOLS THAT COULD PROFIT FROM THE MECHANOSTABILITY OF THESE PROTEINS. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY: 1. DEVELOPING BIOINFORMATIC TOOLS TO RESURRECT CELLULOSOMAL PROTEINS ANCESTORS TO UNDERSTAND HOW MECHANOSTABILITY EVOLVED; 2. INVESTIGATING THE MECHANISM BY WHICH STAPH BACTERIA FORM HIGHLY-STABLE BONDS TO THE HUMAN EXTRA-CELLULAR MATRIX. PARTICULARLY, THIS PROJECT WILL EMPLOY A COMBINATION OF CLASSICAL MOLECULAR DYNAMICS, HYBRID QUANTUM/CLASSICAL CALCULATIONS, AND DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION METHODS, IN ORDER TO CHARACTERIZE SUB-ATOMIC PROPERTIES OF PROTEINS UNDER MECHANICAL STRESS. ADDITIONALLY, NEW MOLECULAR DYNAMICS METHODS FOR ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION WILL BE MADE EASIER BY IMPLEMENTING THEM INTO GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES.

FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SITTING ON A BUS, WE TRACK THE ORDER OF STOPS, SO WE CAN GET READY, STAND-UP AND EXIT AT THE RIGHT TIME. TO MAKE THESE RESPONSES, WE MUST KEEP TRACK OF THE ORDER OF INDIVIDUAL EVENTS. IN ADDITION TO TRACKING SEQUENCES, OUR LIVES ARE ALSO SHAPED BY OUR ABILITIES TO GENERATE SEQUENCES, WHICH ARE FOUNDATIONAL FOR EVERYTHING FROM TYING SHOELACES TO FORMING A SENTENCE OR WRITING A SYMPHONY. UNDERSTANDING AND FOLLOWING SEQUENCES ALSO UNDERLIES OUR ABILITY TO LEARN. ILLNESSES OR INJURIES THAT IMPAIR THIS TRACKING CAN HAVE DEVASTATING EFFECTS ON NORMAL LIFE. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF TRACKING SEQUENCES, HOW OUR BRAIN SUPPORTS THIS ABILITY IS MOSTLY UNKNOWN. EVEN THE MOST ADVANCED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS CANNOT SOLVE MANY SEQUENTIAL PROBLEMS THAT HUMANS AND ANIMALS CAN EASILY PERFORM. IN ADDITION TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ADVANCING UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEURAL BASIS OF SEQUENCES, THIS PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES AN EXTENSIVE MULTIPRONGED OUTREACH EFFORT: SHARING THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT DISCOVERIES IN NEUROSCIENCE WITH EDUCATIONAL EVENTS IN THE COMMUNITY, IN SCHOOLS AND DURING RESEARCH-THEMED FAIRS, TEACHING NEUROSCIENCE TO STUDENTS WITH DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, AND RUNNING AN ANNUAL CONFERENCE FOCUSED ON ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING WOMEN WHO WISH TO PURSUE A CAREER IN STEM FIELDS. TO DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SEQUENCE REPRESENTATION, RESEARCHERS WILL RECORD BRAIN ACTIVITY FROM A MODEL ORGANISM (MACAQUE MONKEYS) DURING PERFORMANCE OF AUDITORY AND VISUAL SEQUENCE TRACKING TASKS. THIS TASK WILL ILLUMINATE TWO WAYS THE BRAIN COULD TRACK SEQUENTIAL INFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SEQUENCE IS ?ABCD?, ONE WAY TO KNOW WHAT COMES AFTER ?B? IS TO LEARN THAT ?C? ALWAYS COMES AFTER ?B?. THIS WOULD BE A RELATIONAL REPRESENTATION. ANOTHER WAY TO KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT IS THAT ?C? IS ALWAYS THE THIRD ITEM IN THE SEQUENCE ? AN ORDINAL REPRESENTATION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BRAIN TRACK THESE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF SEQUENCE INFORMATION: THE MEDIAL PART OF PREFRONTAL CORTEX (MPFC) TRACKS ORDINAL POSITION - WHICH ITEM GOES WITH WHICH PLACE IN THE SEQUENCE (C IS THIRD), AND THE LATERAL PART OF PREFRONTAL CORTEX (LPFC) RECEIVES ORDINAL INFORMATION FROM MPFC TO TRACK WHICH ITEM GOES WITH WHICH PLACE (C IS THIRD) AND COMBINES THIS WITH RELATIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH ITEM COMES NEXT (C AFTER B). RESEARCHERS WILL RECORD BRAIN ACTIVITY IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS WHILE MONKEYS PERFORM THE TASK: BY RECORDING THE ACTIVITY OF SINGLE CELLS IN THE PFC AND OTHER BRAIN AREAS, AND BY WHOLE BRAIN NEUROIMAGING (USING FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING - FMRI). USING THESE TWO COMPLEMENTARY METHODS PROVIDES TWO INDEPENDENT KINDS OF EVIDENCE WHICH CAN BE INTEGRATED TO GIVE MORE INSIGHT INTO SEQUENCE REPRESENTATION. THESE EXPERIMENTS HOLD THE PROMISE OF LEADING TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE BRAIN TRACKS SEQUENCES AND HOW THE BRAIN LEARNS AND PERFORMS COMPLEX TASKS, WHICH REQUIRE A SEQUENCE OF SUCCESSIVE ACTIONS. THE STUDIES ON SEQUENCE TRACKING TASKS AND SEQUENCE REPRESENTATION IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES WILL ILLUMINATE AND GIVE INSIGHT INTO HUMAN COGNITION AND THE NEURAL BASIS OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE ON SIMILAR SEQUENCING TASKS.

THE RESEARCH SUPPORTED BY THIS FACULTY EARLY CAREER DEVELOPMENT (CAREER) AWARD WILL GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE AS THE INVESTIGATORS LEVERAGE LIGHT-BASED THREE-DIMENSIONAL PRINTING TO ADDRESS THREE KEY BARRIERS THAT CURRENTLY LIMIT THE FABRICATION OF BIOMIMETIC MATERIALS: TOXICITY OF PRINTING RESINS, TUNABILITY OF PROPERTIES, AND ABILITY TO CREATE FEATURES THAT SPAN BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT LENGTH SCALES. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL EXPAND THE BREADTH OF TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR MANUFACTURING ADVANCED BIOMATERIALS AND FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND DEVICES THAT ENABLE BETTER DIAGNOSIS, STUDY, AND TREATMENT OF NUMEROUS DISEASES AND CONDITIONS. THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES THE CREATION OF A COMMUNITY OF HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED AND UNDERSERVED RISING RESEARCHERS, FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. PARTICIPANTS WILL BE CONNECTED ACROSS THE EDUCATIONAL CONTINUUM BY A COOPERATIVE MENTORING NETWORK AND WILL ENGAGE IN LEARNING AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO 3D-PRINTED BIOMATERIALS. AS SUCH, THE PROJECT WILL HELP TO ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY AND TECHNICAL STRENGTH OF THE BIOMATERIALS MANUFACTURING WORKFORCE. ALTHOUGH PHOTO-MANUFACTURING IS A PROMISING TECHNIQUE FOR THE CREATION OF ADVANCED BIOMATERIALS, ITS USE IS LIMITED BY SEVERAL MAJOR BARRIERS: I) MANY TRADITIONAL PHOTOINITIATORS ARE BIOLOGICALLY DISRUPTIVE, II) CONTROLLING MECHANOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES ACROSS THE MICRO- AND MESO-SCALE CONTINUUM IS CHALLENGING, AND III) INNOVATION IS HINDERED BY HISTORICAL UNDERREPRESENTATION OF SOME GROUPS IN STEM AND INSUFFICIENT PRACTICAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS BY QUANTIFYING BOTH THE EFFICIENCY AND CYTOCOMPATIBILITY OF BIOSOURCED PHOTOINITIATOR CANDIDATES IN TWO-PHOTON POLYMERIZATION (MICRO-SCALE) AND DIGITAL LIGHT PROCESSING (MESO-SCALE). ADDITIONALLY, THE TEAM WILL DEVELOP MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CROSSLINKING RATE AND FINAL FEATURE PROPERTIES, THEN EMPLOY THESE RELATIONSHIPS TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE METHODS FOR COUPLING MICRO AND MESO PRINTING TO CREATE MULTISCALE FEATURES WITH CONTINUOUS AND PREDICTABLE MECHANOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES. FURTHERMORE, THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL HELP TO ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY AND TECHNICAL SKILL LEVEL OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE AND MANUFACTURING WORKFORCE BY CREATING THE ?3D PRINTING IN BIOENGINEERING RISING RESEARCHER COMMUNITY.? THIS COMMUNITY WILL INCLUDE EDUCATION AND RESEARCH ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES AT ALL LEVELS, WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON COOPERATIVE MENTORING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES ARE TIGHTLY INTEGRATED: SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES WILL BE APPLIED TO STUDENT-DRIVEN PROJECTS, AND STUDENT CREATIVITY IN THESE APPLICATIONS WILL SPUR INNOVATION FOR FUTURE ADVANCEMENTS IN PHOTO-MANUFACTURING AND APPLIED FIELDS.

IN ADDITION, THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY THE DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY AND THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCOR). ALL MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS PASS THROUGH DIFFERENT STAGES IN THEIR LIFE CYCLE. THESE STAGES MAY DIFFER IN THE NUMBER OF CELLS, THE NUMBER OF CHROMOSOMES PER CELL, OR THE ARRANGEMENT OF GENETIC INFORMATION ON THE CHROMOSOMES. FOR EXAMPLE, HUMANS HAVE TWO LIFE STAGES: THE HAPLOID STAGE CONSISTS OF EGGS OR SPERM, AND THE DIPLOID STAGE EXTENDS FROM EMBRYO TO ADULT. THESE ALTERNATING STAGES MAKE A LIFE CYCLE. ACROSS THE NATURAL WORLD, THERE IS AN AMAZING DIVERSITY IN THE DURATION AND COMPLEXITY OF LIFE CYCLES. THIS PROJECT WILL EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DIVERSITY BY LINKING PREDICTIONS ABOUT LIFE CYCLES AND REPRODUCTIVE VARIATION. UNDERSTANDING THE CONVERGENCE OF THESE TWO FUNDAMENTAL ORGANISMAL TRAITS ? THE LIFE CYCLE AND REPRODUCTION ? IS CRUCIAL FOR PREDICTING HOW SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES. COMMON GARDEN EXPERIMENTS AND DNA ANALYSIS OF A WIDESPREAD SEAWEED WILL ALLOW THE INVESTIGATORS TO EXPLORE THESE CONNECTIONS. THE RESEARCH PLAN IS ENHANCED BY A MONTH-LONG FIELD COURSE FOR UNDERGRADUATES, IN WHICH STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT ALGAE IN MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS. STUDENTS IN THIS COURSE ALSO COLLECT DATA FOR THE TWO MAIN RESEARCH AIMS. IN ADDITION, RESEARCH IS COORDINATED WITH THE ALABAMA WATER WATCH AND THE CAHABA RIVER SOCIETY. COORDINATION WITH THESE GROUPS INCREASES SCIENTIFIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY IN BIRMINGHAM AND ACROSS ALABAMA. THE RESEARCHERS LEVERAGE A WIDESPREAD SEAWEED THAT HAS BECOME INVASIVE WHERE IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. UPON INVASION, THE DIPLOID STAGE PREDOMINATES. THE PROJECT INVESTIGATES HOW THE LIFE CYCLE OF THIS ALGA HAS RESPONDED TO THE PROCESS OF INVASION, THUS PERMITTING A TEST OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN LIFE CYCLES AND REPRODUCTION. TWO SETS OF EXPERIMENTS ADDRESS TWO MAJOR QUESTIONS. THE FIRST SET OF EXPERIMENTS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PREDICTIONS OF ECOLOGICAL AND GENETIC MODELS. HERE, RESEARCHERS CARRY OUT COMMON GARDEN EXPERIMENTS TO REVEAL HOW DIFFERENT GENOTYPES RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IMPORTANT TO AN INTERTIDAL ALGA, SUCH AS SALINITY AND TEMPERATURE. ACCORDING TO ECOLOGICAL PREDICTIONS, THE TWO LIFE STAGES SHOULD RESPOND DIFFERENTLY. THE SECOND SET OF EXPERIMENTS EVALUATES HOW THE RELATIVE LENGTH OF THE DIPLOID AND HAPLOID STAGES AFFECT THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. TO INVESTIGATE THIS QUESTION, DNA IS SAMPLED FROM NATURAL POPULATIONS OF THE SEAWEED?S NATIVE AND INTRODUCED RANGE. POPULATION GENETIC ANALYSIS DETERMINES WHETHER A PROLONGED HAPLOID STAGE AFFECTS SEAWEED REPRODUCTION. SPECIFICALLY, IT CAN DETECT WHETHER THE SEAWEEDS MATE BY OUTCROSSING, SELF-FERTILIZATION OR ASEXUAL PROPAGATION, AND WHETHER THIS REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY VARIES DEPENDING ON THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF LIFE CYCLE. TOGETHER, THE RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS PROVIDE UNIQUE INSIGHT INTO THE WAYS IN WHICH LIFE CYCLES AND REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES ARE INTERDEPENDENT.

THESE ANIMALS FARM BACTERIA IN OR ON THEIR TISSUES THAT USE THE CHEMICAL ENERGY IN VENTING FLUID AS ENERGY TO MAKE SUGAR, IN A PROCESS KNOWN AS CHEMOSYNTHESIS. THOUGH THEY REQUIRE THEIR SYMBIONTS FOR SURVIVAL, MOST SYMBIOTIC VENT ANIMALS ACQUIRE THEIR SYMBIONTS FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL POOL AT SOME POINT IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. ESPECIALLY FOR LONG-DISPERSING MARINE ANIMALS THAT ARE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER NEW HABITAT CONDITIONS WHEN THEY SETTLE, IT HAS LONG BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT ACQUISITION OF A LOCALLY OPTIMAL SYMBIONT STRAIN AFTER SETTLEMENT MAY HAVE ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGES. TO TEST THIS IDEA, THE PI WILL EVALUATE LOCAL ADAPTATION IN THE BACTERIAL SYMBIONTS ASSOCIATED WITH A FOUNDATION SNAIL GENUS, ALVINICONCHA, AT DEEP-SEA HYDROTHERMAL VENTS IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC. USING POPULATION GENOMICS METHODS AND HIGH-PRESSURE PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS, THIS PROJECT WILL ASSESS WHETHER HABITAT-SPECIFIC SYMBIONT STRAINS DIFFER IN THEIR ADAPTATION TO DIFFERENT HABITAT CONDITIONS. THE PROJECT INVESTIGATES A FUNDAMENTAL HYPOTHESIS REGARDING ADAPTATION AT DEEP-SEA VENTS, AS WELL AS PROVIDES KEY INFORMATION IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ECOLOGY OF ALVINICONCHA, A GENUS OF IMPORTANT FOUNDATION SPECIES THAT HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS ?ENDANGERED?

DESPITE ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ECOLOGY OF THE DOMINANT FAUNA AT HYDROTHERMAL VENT ECOSYSTEMS, LOCAL ADAPTATION IN CHEMOSYNTHETIC SYMBIONTS IS STILL POORLY ADDRESSED. THIS PROJECT WILL USE POPULATION GENOMICS AND COMMON-GARDEN-LIKE EXPERIMENTS TO ASSESS LOCAL ADAPTATION IN THE BACTERIAL SYMBIONTS ASSOCIATED WITH A FOUNDATION SNAIL GENUS, ALVINICONCHA, AT DEEP-SEA HYDROTHERMAL VENTS IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC. FIRST, HIGH-RESOLUTION GEOCHEMICAL SURVEYS OF ALVINICONCHA WILL BE COUPLED WITH SYMBIONT POPULATION GENOMICS TO INVESTIGATE GENOMIC EVIDENCE FOR LOCAL ADAPTATION. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF LOCI THAT MAY PLAY A ROLE IN ADAPTATION TO LOCAL GEOCHEMISTRY. SECOND, HIGH-PRESSURE, COMMON-GARDEN-LIKE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED TO DIRECTLY ASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCAL ADAPTATION AND INVESTIGATE UNDERLYING SYMBIONT GENOMIC TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH OBSERVED PHENOTYPES. FINALLY, ALVINICONCHA SYMBIONT POPULATIONS ACROSS THE WESTERN PACIFIC WILL BE CHARACTERIZED WITH POPULATION GENOMICS TO IDENTIFY THE GENOMIC TRAITS POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO LOCAL SYMBIONT ADAPTATION ACROSS MULTIPLE GEOGRAPHICAL SCALES, LEVELS OF HOST POPULATION CONNECTIVITY, AND INTENSITIES OF SITE-TO-SITE HABITAT DIFFERENCES.

THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE HOW DIFFERENT COLORS OF NIGHT LIGHTING AFFECT THE HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL RHYTHMS OF WILD BIRDS. IT WILL ALSO TEST HOW NIGHT LIGHT AFFECTS AVIAN OFFSPRING. LASTLY, AN INTEGRATED EDUCATIONAL PLAN SEEKS TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF YOUNG SCIENTISTS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL: 1) PROVIDE TANGIBLE OUTCOMES THROUGH OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY, 2) PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR ADDRESSING LIGHT POLLUTION, AND 3) CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES, PARTICULARLY FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. PROJECT RESULTS WILL ENHANCE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING BY CONVERTING LIGHT DATA INTO THE INDEX USED BY LIGHT ENGINEERS, WHICH WILL INFORM ENGINEERS ABOUT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT SOURCES THAT ARE MOST ECO-FRIENDLY.

STATION FOR FAMILY STEM NIGHTS, REACHING A BROADER AUDIENCE OF FAMILIES, TEACHERS, AND ADMINISTRATORS. TOGETHER, THE FINDINGS OF THIS PROJECT AND THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS COHESIVELY TACKLE AN ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURE THAT IS OF GROWING SOCIETAL AND SCIENTIFIC CONCERN. CYCLES OF LIGHT ARE A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS, BUT OVER THE LAST HALF CENTURY, ELECTRIC LIGHTING HAS INUNDATED THE WORLD WITH ALAN. ALAN PROFOUNDLY DISRUPTS THE TEMPORAL ORGANIZATION OF LIGHT CYCLES, AND THE GROWING DIVERSITY OF ELECTRIC LIGHTS ALSO PROVIDES LIGHT WITH SPECTRA DIFFERENT FROM ANY NATURAL LIGHT. IT IS CLEAR FROM DECADES OF RESEARCH THAT LIGHT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME CUE FOR THE REGULATION OF CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS. GROWING EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT LIGHT POLLUTION CAUSES PHYSIOLOGICAL DISRUPTION AND PATHOLOGY. HOWEVER, THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS THAT CAUSE THESE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS REMAIN UNCLEAR. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST WHETHER SHORT-WAVELENGTH ALAN REDUCES FITNESS THROUGH CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO 1) EVALUATE WHETHER OBSERVED PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF ALAN ARE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL CLOCK, 2) IDENTIFY EFFECTS ON REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS AND OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT, AND 3) ENGAGE THE NEXT GENERATION OF YOUNG SCIENTISTS THROUGH EDUCATIONAL TOOLS AND MENTORING. WE WILL COMBINE FIELD AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF NOCTURNAL LIGHTING WITH MODIFIED SPECTRA ON BEHAVIOR, PHYSIOLOGY, REPRODUCTION, AND GENE EXPRESSION. BY UNCOVERING THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING RESPONSES TO ARTIFICIAL LIGHT, WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEASURE, PREDICT AND AMELIORATE POTENTIAL HARMFUL EFFECTS OF LIGHT POLLUTION, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE DISRUPTIVE EFFECTS VARY DEPENDING ON THE SPECTRAL COMPOSITION OF LIGHT.

CAREER: MULTIMODAL BIOMATERIALS FOR SEQUENTIAL DELIVERY OF DIVERSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC CARGOS NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM IS DIVERSE BEYOND COMPARE AND CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO ALL TYPES OF CHALLENGES WITH PRECISE CONTROL OVER THE TIMING AND AREA OF THE RESPONSE. HOWEVER, IMMUNOTHERAPIES ? ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING TYPES OF MEDICINES IN THE 21ST CENTURY ? ARE TYPICALLY GIVEN ALL AT ONCE AS SINGLE THERAPIES, WITHOUT REGARDS TO THE SPATIAL AND DYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONS OF DELIVERY. ADDITIONALLY, MATERIALS CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE TIMING OR SEQUENCE OF DELIVERY OF IMMUNOTHERAPIES ARE LACKING. THE CURRENT PROJECT SEEKS TO OVERCOME THESE SHORTCOMINGS AND RADICALLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO PROGRAM IMMUNE RESPONSES. TO DO SO, NEW BIOMATERIALS THAT CAN DELIVER A DIVERSE RANGE OF IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS IN PRECISE SEQUENCES WILL BE GENERATED. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE PROJECT WILL PRODUCE INNOVATIVE NEW POLYMERIC TECHNOLOGIES WITH APPLICATIONS RANGING FROM VACCINE DEVELOPMENT TO IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY, HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE HEALTHCARE IN THE US. OUTREACH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT BUILD FROM THESE RESEARCH EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE: INCORPORATION OF THE RESEARCH FINDINGS INTO UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING, RECRUITMENT AND EXPOSURE OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS TO RESEARCH THROUGH A NANOENGINEERING RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATES (REU), AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A STEM EXCURSION PROGRAM WHERE NORTH MISSISSIPPI HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS VISIT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI TO LEARN ABOUT THE GROWING FIELD OF NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY, WHILE UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS SERVE AS MENTORS/ROLE MODELS TO SOLIDIFY THEIR IDENTITY IN STEM. TECHNICAL SUMMARY: EXISTING IMMUNOTHERAPIES INVOLVE EITHER A SINGLE AGENT OR MULTIPLE AGENTS GIVEN IN COMBINATION. HOWEVER, DUE TO BOTH THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND THE DIVERSE PHYSICOCHEMICAL NATURE OF IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS, IT IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING TO DESIGN COMBINATION IMMUNOTHERAPIES WITH THE SPATIOTEMPORAL CONTROL OF DELIVERY NEEDED TO PROGRAM HOLISTIC IMMUNE RESPONSES. MOREOVER, MATERIALS CAPABLE OF SEQUENTIALLY DELIVERING IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS FROM DIVERSE CHEMICAL CLASSES WITH CONTROL OVER THE TIMING AND ORDER OF RELEASE ARE LACKING. THUS, THE CENTRAL RESEARCH GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A NEW CLASS OF MULTIMODAL BIOMATERIALS CAPABLE OF: 1) DELIVERING DIVERSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS FROM A SINGLE MATERIAL AND 2) PROGRAMMING SEQUENTIAL DRUG RELEASE TO RECRUIT, TRAIN, AND SUSTAIN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM DURING RESPONSE. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO GENERATE A NEW CLASS OF GLYCOPOLYMER-CORONA NANOPARTICLES (NPS) THAT CAN TRAIN THE IMMUNE RESPONSE BY CO-DELIVERING ANTIGEN AND ADJUVANT TO THE SAME ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELL (APC) WITH PRECISE TARGETING OF EACH COMPONENT TO THE APPROPRIATE SUBCELLULAR LOCATION OF INTEREST. IMPORTANTLY, GLYCOPOLYMER CORONAS WILL CIRCUMVENT THE USE OF POLY(ETHYLENE GLYCOL), WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NEGATIVE REACTIONS IN SOME PATIENTS, TARGET THE NPS TO PRECISE SUBSETS OF APCS, AND INHERENTLY ENABLE CRYOPROTECTION AND LYOPHILIZATION OF THE NPS. THE SECOND DESIGN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO GENERATE MULTILAYERED FILMS WHICH SURFACE ERODE AND RELEASE CARGO SEQUENTIALLY AT PRE-PROGRAMMED RATES. THE FILMS WILL BE COMPOSED OF POLY(2-VINYL-4,4-DIMETHYLAZLACTONE) (PVDMA), WHICH UNDERGOES RING-OPENING REACTIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF NUCLEOPHILES SUCH AS PRIMARY AMINES TO PRODUCE HYDROLYTICALLY-STABLE AMIDE BONDS OR ALCOHOLS TO YIELD HYDROLYZABLE ESTER LINKAGES. THUS, BY POST-POLYMERIZATION MODIFICATION, WE WILL PRODUCE CROSSLINKED POLYMER NETWORKS WITH CONTROL OVER THE CROSSLINKING DENSITY, SWELLING AND EROSION RATES, AND SCAFFOLD HYDROPHOBICITY. THE RESULTING MULTILAYERED FILMS WILL BE ENGINEERED WITH THREE DISTINCT PHASES OF RELEASE: 1) RECRUITMENT PHASE TO ATTRACT APCS, 2) TRAINING PHASE TO DELIVER ANTIGEN AND ADJUVANT TO APCS, AND 3) SUSTAINMENT PHASE TO BOOST IMMUNOGENICITY AND MAINTAIN A ROBUST IMMUNE RESPONSE.

THE CELLULAR FORCES DRIVING SUCH CELL SHAPE CHANGES AND REARRANGEMENT ARE GENERATED BY CYTOSKELETAL PROTEINS THAT ACT LIKE MOTORS MOVING ALONG PROTEIN-BASED FILAMENTS. THEREFORE, DETERMINING THE REGULATORY MECHANISMS OF THE CYTOSKELETAL PROTEIN NETWORKS IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING HOW ORGANS FORM A PROPER SHAPE.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO TAKE INSPIRATION FROM HOW CHILDREN LEARN LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO IMPROVE THE MODELS AND METHODS OF MACHINES THAT LEARN LANGUAGE. IMPROVED LANGUAGE LEARNING IN MACHINES WILL ENABLE MACHINES TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE MORE QUICKLY, CLEARLY, SAFELY, AND IN WAYS THAT LOWER BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE TO USE COMPLEX TECHNOLOGY WITH A NATURAL SPOKEN LANGUAGE INTERFACE. THIS CAREER PROJECT EXAMINES A NOVEL APPROACH FOR COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO LEARN SPOKEN LANGUAGE THAT WILL ADVANCE A THEORETICAL MODEL AND IMPROVE HOW PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS COMMUNICATE. RESEARCH WILL IMPROVE LANGUAGE MODELING IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING BY TAKING INSPIRATION FROM HOW CHILDREN LEARN LANGUAGE: THEY INTERACT WITH OTHERS TO LEARN WORDS THAT DENOTE PHYSICAL ENTITIES AND EVENTS, AND, LIKE ALL HUMANS, OFTEN RESPOND EMOTIONALLY AND EMBODY HOW THEY FEEL IN THEIR BEHAVIOR, WHEREAS RESEARCHERS CURRENTLY LARGELY TRAIN LANGUAGE MODELS ONLY ON STATIC TEXT. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL USE TWO ROBOTIC PLATFORMS FOR THE RESEARCH AND SIGNIFICANTLY ENRICH MODEL EFFICACY AND WILL ADD KNOWLEDGE OF EMOTION BY MODELING IT BASED ON HUMAN PERCEPTIONS OF ROBOT BEHAVIORS. THE TEAM WILL ADD EMBODIED KNOWLEDGE BY GROUNDING INTO VISION AND ROBOT STATES, AND FINALLY, THE TEAM WILL TRAIN AND EVALUATE A ROBOT THAT USES THE LANGUAGE MODEL AS IT INTERACTS WITH HUMANS TO LEARN LANGUAGE FROM THEM. THE STUDY WILL ALSO RESULT IN TWO IMPORTANT DATASETS: ROBOT BEHAVIORS WITH ACCOMPANYING DESCRIPTIONS OF THOSE BEHAVIORS AND EMOTION LABELS, AND LONGITUDINAL DATA OF ROBOTS INTERACTING AND LEARNING LANGUAGE FROM HUMANS. THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO (1) MODEL EMOTION; TEST, AND REFINE THROUGH INTERACTION, (2) DEVELOP A UNIFIED LANGUAGE MODEL, AND (3) ENGAGE PEOPLE AND ROBOTS THAT LEARN LANGUAGE WITH EMOTIONAL CONTENT.

HOWEVER, NATURAL PROCESSES DRIVEN BY PLATE TECTONICS MEAN THAT THIS SEDIMENTARY RECORD IS INHERENTLY INCOMPLETE. AT DIFFERENT TIMES DURING EARTH?S HISTORY, SOME REGIONS EXPERIENCED SEDIMENT DEPOSITION, WHICH BURIES AND THEREFORE HEATS UP ROCKS, WHILE OTHER REGIONS EXPERIENCED EROSION, WHICH BOTH REMOVES PORTIONS OF THE ROCK RECORD AND COOLS OFF THE ROCKS THAT PERSIST BY BRINGING THEM CLOSER TO EARTH?S SURFACE. THIS STUDY WILL USE THE GEOCHEMICAL SIGNATURES OF ROCK HEATING AND COOLING THAT OCCURS DURING DEPOSITION AND EROSION TO UNDERSTAND THE GEOLOGIC HISTORIES OF AREAS WHERE NO SEDIMENTARY ROCKS REMAIN. SPECIFICALLY, THE STUDY WILL INVESTIGATE THE ANCIENT RECORD OF SUPERCONTINENT BREAKUP, A PROCESS THAT DRIVES CHANGES IN SEA LEVEL, GLOBAL CLIMATE, AND TOPOGRAPHY. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THREE EARLY-CAREER RESEARCHERS AT DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING TWO WOMEN, AND BUILD NEW RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE COLLABORATING RESEARCH GROUPS. THREE GRADUATE AND NINE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES WILL BE ENGAGED IN COLLABORATIVE, HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN RESEARCH AND LEARN A RANGE OF FIELD, LABORATORY, AND SCIENCE COMMUNICATION METHODS. THE RESEARCHERS WILL ALSO COLLABORATE WITH THE IDAHO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY TO CREATE A MOBILE MUSEUM EXHIBIT THAT WILL HIGHLIGHT THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE CHARISMATIC MOUNTAIN RANGES IN THE STUDY AREA AND VISIT MUSEUMS THAT SERVE RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. UNCONFORMITIES, WHICH ARE ABUNDANT IN THE ROCK RECORD, ARE TRADITIONALLY VIEWED AS UNFILLABLE GAPS IN THE ROCK RECORD OF EARTH?S HISTORY. HOWEVER, THE THERMAL IMPRINT OF SEDIMENTARY COVER ON THE BASEMENT ROCKS THAT UNDERLIE MANY UNCONFORMITIES PROVIDES A RICH ARCHIVE OF THE OTHERWISE INACCESSIBLE PARTS OF A CONTINENT?S TECTONIC HISTORY. THIS RECORD IS NOW ACCESSIBLE DUE TO RECENT CONCEPTUAL AND ANALYTICAL ADVANCES IN LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCHRONOLOGY. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THESE ADVANCES BY TARGETING A CRITICAL GAP IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LAURENTIAN TECTONICS, THE BREAKUP OF SUPERCONTINENT RODINIA, WHILE ESTABLISHING AN APPROACH TO DEEP-TIME THERMOCHRONOLOGY THAT CAN DOCUMENT PRECAMBRIAN TECTONIC ACTIVITY IN REGIONS THAT ALSO EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PHANEROZOIC MOUNTAIN BUILDING. THIS STUDY WILL SAMPLE ALONG A 700-KILOMETER-LONG SEGMENT OF WESTERN LAURENTIA?S RIFTED MARGIN, TARGETING BASEMENT ROCKS DIRECTLY BELOW THE GREAT UNCONFORMITY AND USING FOUR CHRONOMETERS TO PRODUCE HOLISTIC TECTONOTHERMAL HISTORIES TO FILL A BILLION-YEAR GAP IN THE ROCK RECORD. THIS STUDY WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW DEEP TIME THERMOCHRONOLOGY CAN PROVIDE A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE GEOMETRY AND TECTONIC EVOLUTION OF WESTERN LAURENTIA?S RIFTED MARGIN, WHERE MUCH OR ALL OF THE SEDIMENTARY RECORD OF NEOPROTEROZOIC TECTONISM IS MISSING. THIS CAPABILITY WILL BE TESTED BY (1) ESTABLISHING A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN EXTANT NEOPROTEROZOIC SEDIMENTARY ROCKS AND NEOPROTEROZOIC TECTONOTHERMAL EVENTS IN THE UINTA MOUNTAINS, (2) DOCUMENTING THE PROTEROZOIC THERMAL HISTORIES OF BASEMENT BLOCKS WITH NO OVERLYING NEOPROTEROZOIC STRATA IN THE TETON RANGE AND SOUTHWESTERN MONTANA, AND (3) QUANTIFYING INTRA-MOUNTAIN RANGE VARIABILITY OF PROTEROZOIC THERMAL HISTORIES TO EVALUATE THE SAMPLING SPATIAL RESOLUTION NECESSARY FOR EXTRACTING MEANINGFUL TECTONIC INFORMATION FROM THE DEEP-TIME THERMOCHRONOLOGIC RECORD.

THIS PROJECT EXAMINES HOW DIFFERENCES IN CRITICAL-ZONE PROCESSES INFLUENCE TOPOGRAPHY THROUGH A COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENT OF TWO DIFFERENT BEDROCK UNITS ON THE TROPICAL ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO. ON THE ISLAND, ANCIENT VOLCANIC ROCKS FORM STEEP, HIGH PEAKS AND HAVE CLAY-RICH SOILS, WHEREAS GRANITIC ROCKS UNDERLIE RELATIVELY MORE SUBDUED, ROLLING HILLS COVERED BY SANDIER SOILS. THIS STUDY WILL EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THESE DIFFERENCES ON THE OCCURRENCE OF LANDSLIDES, THE SIZE OF SEDIMENT GRAINS THAT POPULATE RIVER CHANNELS, AND THE SIZE AND FREQUENCY OF FLOODS. THE PRINCIPAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT LANDSLIDES CUT MORE DEEPLY IN THE CLAY-RICH SOILS AND, AS A RESULT, DELIVER COARSER SEDIMENT TO RIVERS. THE COARSER SEDIMENT, IN TURN, BETTER SHIELDS THE RIVER CHANNEL FROM EROSION SUCH THAT LARGER FLOODS ARE NEEDED TO CARVE THE UNDERLYING BEDROCK. IN ADDITION, THE CLAY-RICH VOLCANIC SOILS RETAIN MORE RAINWATER, RESULTING IN FEWER FLOODS THAN AREAS COVERED BY SANDY GRANITIC SOILS. THE NET RESULT IS THAT THE VOLCANIC ROCKS MAINTAIN A HIGHER ELEVATION AND STEEPER TOPOGRAPHY THAN THE GRANITIC TERRAIN. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST THESE IDEAS THROUGH DETAILED LANDSLIDE MAPPING, GRAIN-SIZE MEASUREMENTS, STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF STREAMFLOW GAGING DATA, AND MEASUREMENTS OF LONG-TERM LANDSCAPE EROSION RATES. THIS PROJECT WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND ALSO ENGAGE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO, MAYAG?EZ AND COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY IN AN EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, RESEARCH, AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE PROGRAM CENTERED ON COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THE LANDSCAPES IN PUERTO RICO AND COLORADO. VARIATIONS IN TOPOGRAPHIC RELIEF, STEEPNESS, AND HEIGHT ARE OFTEN OBSERVED TO CORRELATE WITH DIFFERENCES IN BEDROCK GEOLOGY. MOST OFTEN, THESE CHANGES ARE INTERPRETED TO RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE ERODIBILITY OF THE UNDERLYING BEDROCK. ON THE TROPICAL ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO INTERMEDIATE-TO-MAFIC VOLCANICLASTIC UNITS UNDERLIE HIGH RELIEF, STEEP MOUNTAINS, WHEREAS FELSIC-RICH GRANITIC-TO-GRANODIORITIC ROCKS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY GENTLER, ROLLING HILLS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT UNWEATHERED BEDROCK STRENGTH AND FRACTURE DENSITY BETWEEN THESE TWO ROCK UNITS IS SIMILAR, IMPLYING THE DIFFERENCES IN PRIMARY ROCK STRENGTH OR ERODIBILITY CANNOT EXPLAIN THE STARK CONTRAST IN TOPOGRAPHY. PREVIOUS STUDIES SHOW THAT THE SOILS DEVELOPED ATOP EACH OF THESE ROCK UNITS ARE DISTINCT, WITH THE MORE MAFIC UNITS COMPRISED OF CLAY-RICH SOILS AND SANDIER SOILS DEVELOPED IN THE MORE FELSIC UNITS. THESE DIFFERENCES IN SOIL CHARACTERISTICS AND ASSOCIATED CRITICAL ZONE ARCHITECTURE PROMOTE RELIEF PRODUCTION IN THE VOLCANICLASTIC UNITS RELATIVE TO THE GRANITIC UNITS. SPECIFICALLY, DIFFERENCES IN THE CRITICAL ZONE AFFECT THE MAGNITUDE OF INCISION THRESHOLDS BY CONTROLLING BEDLOAD GRAIN SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS AND THE FREQUENCY OF FLOODS THAT BREACH THESE THRESHOLDS BY MODULATING SHALLOW, SUBSURFACE HYDROLOGY. THESE HYPOTHESES WILL BE TESTED BY MAPPING LANDSLIDE LOCATIONS, MEASURING GRAIN SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS IN SEDIMENT DEPOSITS, ANALYZING FLOOD STATISTICS FROM EXISTING STREAM GAGING STATIONS, AND CALCULATING LONG-TERM EROSION RATES FROM COSMOGENIC RADIONUCLIDES. DATASETS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED INTO A MODELING FRAMEWORK THAT PREDICTS FLUVIAL LANDSCAPE RELIEF AS A FUNCTION OF ROCK STRENGTH, THE MAGNITUDE OF INCISION THRESHOLDS, AND THE FREQUENCY OF THRESHOLD BREACHING FLOODS.

POST-WILDFIRE PROCESSES ON SOIL SEALING FOR HYDROLOGIC FLUXES IN COMPLEX TERRAIN -IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT FLOODS AND EROSION FOLLOWING A WILDFIRE CAN BE COSTLY TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC PROCESSES THAT ALTER SOIL CHARACTERISTICS TO INCREASE FLOODING AND EROSION ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. SOIL SEALING IS ONE OF THE LESS STUDIED POST-WILDFIRE PROCESSES BECAUSE THE PEAK IMPACT OF SOIL SEALING OCCURS IMMEDIATELY AFTER A WILDFIRE WHEN IT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TO MAKE FIELD OBSERVATIONS. HOWEVER, THIS TIME PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AFTER A WILDFIRE ALSO HOLDS THE HIGHEST RISK FOR HIGH DAMAGE FLOODING DUE TO THE LACK OF VEGETATION. TO INVESTIGATE THE SOIL SEALING PROCESSES THAT OCCUR IMMEDIATELY AFTER A WILDFIRE, THE INVESTIGATORS IN THIS PROJECT WILL CONDUCT LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO SIMULATE RAINFALL ON BURNED SOILS AND ASH MATERIALS. THE OUTCOMES WILL PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION ABOUT POST-WILDFIRE SOIL SEALING PROCESSES WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT AND DISASTER MITIGATION. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNICAL SKILLS FOR FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 4TH AND 5TH GRADE SCIENCE LESSON ON SOIL EROSION. THE OVERARCHING RESEARCH QUESTION OF THIS PROJECT IS: HOW DOES THE SLOPE ANGLE OF A LAND SURFACE AFFECT SOIL SEALING PROCESSES IMMEDIATELY AFTER A WILDFIRE, AND HOW DOES THIS IMPACT INFILTRATION FOR CONSEQUENT RAIN EVENTS? AS SLOPE ANGLE INCREASES, SURFACE ASH EROSION RATES WILL INCREASE. AS A RESULT, IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT SOIL SURFACES THAT EXPERIENCE INCREASED STORAGE OF ASH WILL PROMOTE SOIL SEALING PROCESSES THAT DECREASE INFILTRATION DURING LATER RAIN EVENTS, THEREBY INCREASING RUNOFF. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, LABORATORY SCALE RAINFALL SIMULATIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT A RANGE OF SLOPE ANGLES ON SIMULATED BURNED SOIL CONDITIONS. INVESTIGATORS WILL OBSERVE THE EFFECT OF SLOPE ANGLE BY (1) QUANTIFYING THE EFFECT OF SLOPE ANGLE ON SURFACE ASH EROSION AND SURFACE STORAGE THROUGH RAINFALL EXPERIMENTS, AND (2) DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF ASH RETENTION, IF ANY, ON SOIL PROPERTIES AFTER RAINFALL EXPERIMENTS.

ROCK HERBARIUM THROUGH DIGITIZATION -THIS PROJECT WILL PRESERVE AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE JOSEPH F. ROCK HERBARIUM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI?I AT M?NOA THROUGH DIGITIZATION OF ITS 55,000 SPECIMENS. HAWAI?I HAS SOME OF THE GREATEST BIODIVERSITY IN THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO ITS NATIVE PLANTS: 90% ARE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. A HIGH PROPORTION OF THESE PLANTS ARE LISTED AS THREATENED OR ENDANGERED, AND MANY HAVE GONE EXTINCT IN THE LAST CENTURY. NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS SERVE AS INVALUABLE RECORDS OF BIODIVERSITY AND ARE IMPORTANT REFERENCES FOR SPECIES THAT ARE THREATENED, ENDANGERED, OR OTHERWISE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS. THE JOSEPH F. ROCK HERBARIUM IS ONE OF THE OLDEST HERBARIA IN THE PACIFIC AND IS HOME TO RARE AND ENDEMIC SPECIES OF THE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDS. THE NEWLY DIGITIZED SPECIMENS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS ACROSS THE GLOBE, GREATLY INCREASING THE UTILITY OF THE COLLECTION. DIGITIZATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY UNDERGRADUATES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI?I AT M?NOA TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR STUDENTS. THE HERBARIUM WILL HOST VOLUNTEER DIGITIZATION EVENTS, INCREASE COLLABORATION WITH THE CAMPUS ARBORETUM, AND ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC VIA EVENTS AT A LOCAL BOTANICAL GARDEN. THE RARE AND ENDEMIC HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLAND PLANT SPECIMENS IN THE ROCK HERBARIUM WILL BE PRESERVED THROUGH OVERALL MODERNIZATION OF THE COLLECTION. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL DIGITIZE THE 55,000 SPECIMENS IN THE COLLECTION, REMOVE THE BACKLOG OF SPECIMENS THAT NEED TO BE ACCESSIONED, AND DISSEMINATE SPECIMEN DATA TO A BROADER RESEARCH COMMUNITY THROUGH A DEDICATED CONSORTIUM OF PACIFIC HERBARIA WEB PORTAL AND IDIGBIO.ORG. MODERNIZATION WILL ALSO INCLUDE EXPANDED PEST MANAGEMENT AND EXPANDING THE THROUGHPUT OF SPECIMEN DIGITIZATION. THE PROJECT ADDITIONALLY SERVES TO MAINTAIN AND STRENGTHEN COLLABORATIONS ACROSS PACIFIC HERBARIA AND PROMOTE DIGITIZATION OF OTHER, SMALLER COLLECTIONS. THE PROJECT WILL EMPLOY NINE STUDENTS EACH YEAR, EMPHASIZING THE TRAINING AND RETENTION OF STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED GROUPS, INCLUDING NATIVE HAWAIIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. OUTREACH EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON CONNECTING PRESERVED SPECIMENS TO LIVING COLLECTIONS ON THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI?I CAMPUS ARBORETUM AND LYON ARBORETUM AND CONTINUING EFFORTS TO CONNECT THE HERBARIUM TO HAWAIIAN CULTURE AND KNOWLEDGE.

DEVELOP A NOVEL STRATEGY TO CONVERT A LARGE CLASS OF CONVENTIONAL THERMOPLASTICS INTO MATERIALS SUITABLE FOR FURTHER REUSE, RECYCLING, AND UPCYCLING. THE DESIGN OF MATERIALS THAT RETAIN PROPERTIES OF CONVENTIONAL THERMOPLASTICS BUT ARE CAPABLE OF END-OF-LIFE CONTROLLED DECONSTRUCTION INTO REUSABLE POLYMER CHAIN FRAGMENTS WILL BE TARGETED. THE POLYMER CHAIN FRAGMENTS PRODUCED BY THIS THERMAL DECOMPOSITION PROCESS WILL BE USED TO SYNTHESIZE RECYCLABLE POLYESTERS, WHICH IN TURN ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY, AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT REDUCES WASTE AND AVOIDS EXCESSIVE USE OF RESOURCES. POLYMER SYNTHESIS, MATERIALS FABRICATION, AND MULTISCALE MODELING WILL BE INTEGRATED IN THIS PROJECT. THE PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO ESTABLISH GUIDELINES FOR EFFICIENT DESIGN OF THERMOPLASTIC MATERIALS; THE ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE THESE MATERIALS COULD POTENTIALLY OPEN A NOVEL DIRECTION IN LARGE-SCALE APPLICATIONS OF RECYCLABLE COMPONENTS EMPLOYED IN THE HOUSEHOLD, CONSTRUCTION, AUTOMOTIVE, AND OTHER SECTORS OF THE U.S. ECONOMY. THE PROJECT WILL OFFER AMPLE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE, UNDERGRADUATE, AND LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. STUDENTS WORKING ON THIS PROJECT WILL GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT CHALLENGES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY. THIS MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO STIMULATE THE UNDERGRADUATE AND K-12 STUDENTS? INTEREST AND INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS IN STEM FIELDS VIA GAINING KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART POLYMER RECYCLING/UPCYCLING TECHNOLOGIES. A STRONG EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON ACTIVELY RECRUITING STUDENTS WITH UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS. SOME OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE RESEARCH AND RELEVANT EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE BROAD SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY VIA A SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING GATEWAY, NANOHUB, WHICH IS A PART OF THE NETWORK FOR COMPUTATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP A MANUFACTURING STRATEGY THAT ENABLES MICROWAVE-TRIGGERED CHEMICAL UPCYCLING OF POLYOLEFINIC MATERIALS AFTER THEIR END-OF-LIFE. THE DESIGN OF POLYOLEFINIC MATERIALS (POMS) WITH PROPERTIES OF CONVENTIONAL POLYOLEFINS BUT CAPABLE OF CONTROLLED DECONSTRUCTION INTO MACROMOLECULAR CHAIN FRAGMENTS WITH WELL-DEFINED MOLECULAR WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION WILL BE TARGETED. FUNCTIONALIZED NANOSHEETS DISPERSED WITHIN THE POMS WILL LOCALIZE HEATING AND TRIGGER FRAGMENTATION UPON APPLICATION OF SHORT MICROWAVE PULSES. MACROMOLECULAR CHAIN FRAGMENTS WILL BE FURTHER USED TO SYNTHESIZE RECYCLABLE SEMICRYSTALLINE POLYESTERS (RPES). FURTHERMORE, CYCLIC DEPOLYMERIZATION AND REPOLYMERIZATION OF THESE SEMICRYSTALLINE POLYESTERS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELING WILL BE ITERATIVELY INTEGRATED. A MULTISCALE MODEL INTEGRATING COARSE-GRAINED (ENERGY-CONSERVING DISSIPATIVE PARTICLE DYNAMICS) AND CONTINUUM APPROACHES WILL BE DEVELOPED. MODEL PARAMETERS WILL BE BASED ON THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA, AND MODEL PREDICTIONS WILL BE VALIDATED WITH EXPERIMENTS. MODELING PREDICTIONS WILL BE USED TO UNDERSTAND AND OPTIMIZE THE FRAGMENTATION PROCESS AND RPE SYNTHESIS AND DEPOLYMERIZATION TO ACHIEVE A TARGETED MOLECULAR WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION OF CHAIN FRAGMENTS AND TO OPTIMIZE DEPOLYMERIZATION AND REPOLYMERIZATION YIELD FOR THE RECYCLABLE SEMICRYSTALLINE POLYESTERS. THE DESIGNED POLYOLEFINIC MICROWAVE-TRIGGERED FRAGMENTATION FUNCTIONALITY WILL BE BUILT-IN DURING FABRICATION WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIALS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH DIRECTLY ADDRESSES CURRENT CHALLENGES BY FOCUSING ON DEVELOPING EFFICIENT CHEMICAL PROCESSES, IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, DESIGNING TAILOR-MADE MATERIALS, AND DEVELOPING COMPUTER SIMULATION APPROACHES AIDING COMPOSITE MATERIAL SYNTHESIS AND PROCESSING. THE MULTISCALE MODELING FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED HEREIN WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE REACTIONS, HEAT TRANSFER, AND DIFFUSION OF ALL THE SPECIES INCLUDING CHAIN FRAGMENTS, MACRORADICALS, AND LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT REAGENTS. THIS MODEL, IN CONJUNCTION WITH EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION, WILL ALLOW ONE TO GAIN A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMIC PROCESSES TAKING PLACE DURING CONTROLLED FRAGMENTATION AND SUBSEQUENT DEPOLYMERIZATION/REPOLYMERIZATION CYCLES. THE REALIZATION OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS ANTICIPATED TO HAVE A TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT OF DECONSTRUCTABLE-ON-DEMAND THERMOPLASTICS, WITH PROPERTIES AND PROCESSABILITY OF CURRENTLY EMPLOYED MATERIALS. POLYOLEFINIC MATERIALS PRODUCED FROM PLASTIC WASTE ARE ENVISIONED TO BECOME AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BE TRAINED IN MODEL AND CODE DEVELOPMENT AND IN MATERIALS SYNTHESIS, FABRICATION, AND CHARACTERIZATION. IMPORTANTLY, THE STUDENTS FOCUSING ON MATERIALS MODELING AND THE STUDENTS CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS WILL INTERACT CLOSELY WITHIN THIS PROJECT, SO THAT ALL THE STUDENTS INVOLVED WILL GAIN A VALUABLE COLLABORATIVE EXPERIENCE AND A BROADER PERSPECTIVE ON THEIR PROJECTS. A STRONG EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON SUPPORTING STUDENT DIVERSITY. FURTHER, THIS PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO STIMULATE UNDERGRADUATE AND K-12 STUDENTS? INTEREST IN STEM FIELDS.

FERMENTED FOODS EXEMPLIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE MICROBES DRIVE THE FERMENTATION THAT RESULTS IN THE FLAVORS, TEXTURES, EXTENDED SHELF-LIFE AND EVEN SOME HEALTH BENEFITS OF THESE FOODS. MANY OF THESE FOODS HAVE MULTI-FACETED SIGNIFICANCE, INCLUDING NUTRITIONAL AND CULTURAL IMPORTANCE AS WELL AS ROLES IN FOOD SECURITY DUE TO EXTENDED SHELF LIFE. WORKING WITH LOCALLY IMPORTANT FERMENTED FOODS, SUCH AS TARO (POI), THIS PROJECT WILL DETERMINE HOW THE SUCCESS AND ABUNDANCE OF MICROBIAL SPECIES IS DETERMINED NOT ONLY BY THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT (E.G., TEMPERATURE, MOISTURE, ACIDITY, NUTRIENTS) BUT ALSO BY BIOTIC INTERACTIONS (E.G., HELPFUL OR HARMFUL INFLUENCES OF OTHER ORGANISMS). THIS PROJECT WILL INCREASE RESEARCH CAPACITY, ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WITH BASIC AND APPLIED IMPORTANCE, AND INITIATE A RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT WILL PROVIDE CULTURALLY RELEVANT SCIENTIFIC TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. THE FELLOWSHIP WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IN THE LABORATORY OF A WORLD LEADER IN FERMENTED FOOD MICROBIOLOGY. THROUGH THIS FELLOWSHIP AND COLLABORATION, THE PI AND STUDENT WILL DEVELOP EXPERTISE IN CUTTING EDGE MOLECULAR METHODS TO IDENTIFY THE TRAITS THAT DETERMINE BACTERIAL FITNESS.

THE PROJECT WILL SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON MICROBIAL INTERACTIONS DURING ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION IN LOCALLY IMPORTANT FERMENTED FOODS, BUT THE SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH QUESTION IS BROADLY IMPORTANT ACROSS BASIC AND APPLIED MICROBIAL ECOLOGY. THE PROJECT WILL EMPLOY RECENTLY DEVELOPED HIGH THROUGHPUT MOLECULAR METHODS TO IDENTIFY GENES OR PUTATIVE TRAITS NEEDED FOR BACTERIAL SURVIVAL. THESE MECHANISTIC METHODS WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH A COMMUNITY ECOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND THE FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF MICROBIAL INTERACTIONS (I.E., HOW MICROBES AFFECT EACH OTHER?S FITNESS), WHAT MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLY THOSE EFFECTS, AND HOW THE INTERACTIONS CHANGE DUE TO SHIFTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF WHY CERTAIN MICROBIAL SPECIES ARE SUCCESSFUL OR ABUNDANT IN A GIVEN ENVIRONMENT. THE NEW KNOWLEDGE GENERATED CAN BENEFIT SOCIETY BY INFORMING FUTURE EFFORTS TO PREDICT THE BENEFICIAL VALUE OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES AND EVENTUALLY ENGINEER MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES FOR DESIRED FUNCTIONS.

THE CORAL REEFS OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ARE CENTRES OF MARINE BIODIVERSITY, YET THE NATURAL RESILIENCE AND BIODIVERSITY OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS ARE UNDER GREAT THREAT. RESEARCH AT DEEPER DEPTHS (MESOPHOTIC CORAL ECOSYSTEMS - MCES; 30 TO >150 M) REVEAL AN UNKNOWN RESERVOIR OF BIODIVERSITY AND NATURAL RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF STEEP ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS. GORGONIAN OCTOCORALS TYPICALLY DOMINATE THESE DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS YET ARE NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY IN THE FIELD AND FROM MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS ALONE. FURTHERMORE, MOLECULAR PHYLOGENIES HAVE BEEN LARGELY UNRESOLVED, UNTIL THE RECENT PIONEERING RESEARCH OF THE PROJECT HOST AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY (NMNH), USING TARGET-CAPTURE GENOMICS. THIS RESEARCH WILL APPLY THESE NOVEL GENOMIC APPROACHES TO THE PI?S RARE AND HIGHLY UNIQUE GORGONIAN COLLECTION FROM THE MESOPHOTIC AND SHALLOW REEFS OF THE INDO-PACIFIC THAT SHE HAS ASSEMBLED OVER SEVERAL YEARS. APPLYING THESE NOVEL GENOMIC APPROACHES TO THE PI?S COLLECTIONS WILL MOVE BEYOND CURRENT ANALYTICAL LIMITATIONS AND ADD TRANSFORMATIVE DATA AND PHYLOGENETIC ACCURACY TO THE CNIDARIAN TREE OF LIFE.

GORGONIAN OCTOCORALS ARE AN ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT, HIGHLY DIVERSE YET POORLY RESOLVED GROUP, WHERE TRADITIONAL MARKERS HAVE LACKED PHYLOGENETIC RESOLUTION AT THE SPECIES AND HIGHER TAXONOMIC LEVEL. DELIMITING SPECIES AND SPECIES BOUNDARIES ACROSS STEEP ENVIRONMENTAL CLINES ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENTS FOR CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PARTICULARLY AS THE VALUE OF MESOPHOTIC ECOSYSTEMS IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNISED. THUS, WE TEST THE HYPOTHESES THAT 1) THE GORGONIAN FAUNA IS DISTINCT AND MORE DIVERSE AT MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS, AND 2) THAT MORPHOTYPES WITHIN THE UBIQUITOUS GENUS ANNELLA GRAY, 1858, ARE DELIMITED BY DEPTH. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED USING THE TARGET-CAPTURE GENOMIC APPROACH DEVELOPED BY THE HOST, WHICH SIMULTANEOUSLY ESTIMATES THE PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TAXA OVER SHALLOW AND DEEP TIME, POPULATION STRUCTURE WITHIN A SPECIES, AND THE DELIMITATION OF SPECIES BOUNDARIES. USING THESE METHODS WILL FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTI-TRAIT (PHENOTYPIC AND GENOMIC) FRAMEWORK THAT WILL 1) ASSESS THE PHYLOGENETIC AND PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN AND BETWEEN GORGONIAN TAXA FROM SHALLOW TO MESOPHOTIC DEPTHS, AND 2) PRESENT AN EXEMPLAR CASE STUDY OF POPULATION STRUCTURE AND SPECIES DELIMITATION IN THE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED GENUS, ANNELLA GRAY, 1858.

HOWEVER, MG AND ITS ALLOYS TEND TO BREAK EASILY UPON DEFORMATION, WHICH HAS SERIOUSLY LIMITED THE MARKET PENETRATION OF MG. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MECHANISM OF DEFORMATION, PARTICULARLY AT THE ATOMIC LEVEL, HAS REMAINED ELUSIVE, WHICH HAS HAMPERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO CONTROL THE DEFORMATION BEHAVIORS AND PROPERTIES OF MG ALLOYS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISMS OF MG DEFORMATION AND THEN DEVELOP A RELIABLE MULTISCALE MODEL THAT INTEGRATES THOSE MECHANISMS; THIS MODEL CAN THEN BE USED TO PREDICT THE DEFORMATION BEHAVIORS OF MG AND ITS ALLOYS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL HAVE A PROFOUND SOCIETAL IMPACT BY ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHTWEIGHT AND DUCTILE MG ALLOYS TO REPLACE CONVENTIONAL STEELS AND ALUMINUM ALLOYS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES.

SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT A LOSS OF INSULATING SNOW COVER CAUSED BY GLOBAL WARMING EXPOSES YELLOW-CEDAR (YC) ROOTS TO FROST DAMAGE, WHICH EVENTUALLY LEADS TO TREE DEATH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS AFFECTING YELLOW-CEDAR (YC), AN ICONIC TREE SPECIES IN WIDESPREAD DECLINE. TO DATE, OVER 3,000 KM2 OF YC FORESTS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DIEBACK, WHICH HAS HAD FAR-REACHING ECONOMIC, ECOLOGICAL, AND CULTURAL EFFECTS IN SOUTHEAST ALASKA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA.

IN ADDITION, RAPID TESTING IS CRUCIAL TO COMBAT THE PANDEMIC AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DESIGN A DIRECT CLUSTERED REGULARLY INTERSPACED SHORT PALINDROMIC REPEATS (CRISPR) BASED POINT OF CARE DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM WITHOUT PRE-AMPLIFICATION OF VIRAL GENOMES. IT WILL ALLOW ULTRALOW AND ULTRASENSITIVE DETECTION OF MANY DISEASES (E.G., CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, CANCER, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES) AT AN EARLY STAGE WHEN THE CONCENTRATION OF VIRAL GENOMES IN BODY FLUIDS (I.E., URINE, BLOOD, SALIVA) IS STILL VERY LOW AND NOT SUFFICIENT TO BE DETECTED BY EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES. THIS NSF EPSCOR RII TRACK-4 FELLOWSHIP PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE WITH A RENOWNED EXPERT IN POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTICS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL LEAD TO NONINVASIVE, INEXPENSIVE, MASS-PRODUCIBLE SYSTEMS FOR EARLY DETECTION, TREATMENT OUTCOME EVALUATION OF DISEASES, GREATLY IMPROVING PATIENT MORBIDITY AND REDUCING HEALTHCARE COST, PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO NEVADA, WHICH CONSISTENTLY RANKS NEAR THE BOTTOM IN TERMS OF HIGHER RATES OF THE 12 LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT ARE TO (1) INTEGRATE NANOANTENNA WITH SUPER-HYDROPHOBIC SURFACES FOR ENHANCING THE CRISPR/CAS12A DETECTION SENSITIVITY WITHOUT PRE-AMPLIFICATION; (2) INTEGRATE THE DESIGNED ENHANCED CRISPR/CAS12A FLUORESCENCE DETECTION MODULE WITH MICROFLUIDICS FOR VIRAL DETECTION IN THE BLOOD SAMPLE. ALTHOUGH CRISPR BASED POINT OF CARE DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM HAS EMERGED AS A POPULAR TECHNOLOGY AND A POWERFUL TOOL FOR RAPID SCREENING DUE TO ITS SIMPLICITY AND FLEXIBILITY, IT STILL HAS MANY LIMITATIONS SUCH AS LOW STABILITY IN COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES. ONE PROMISING SOLUTION IS TO EXPLORE THE NANOANTENNA TECHNIQUE TO TRIGGER THE ENHANCED LOCALIZED SURFACE PLASMON. HOWEVER, THE NANOANTENNA TECHNIQUE IS STILL FAR FROM BEING ROUTINELY IMPLEMENTED IN BIOMEDICAL FIELDS DUE TO A MAJOR OBSTACLE NOT FROM PLASMONICS BUT FROM THE MASS TRANSPORT: MOST NANOANTENNAS TYPICALLY RELY ON DIFFUSION TO CAPTURE TARGET MOLECULES, WHICH MAKES THE DETECTION TIME IMPRACTICALLY LONG. THIS PROJECT INTEGRATES THE NANOANTENNA WITH THE SUPERHYDROPHOBIC SURFACE TO ADDRESS THIS DIFFUSION LIMIT. DROPLETS OVER SUPER-HYDROPHOBIC SURFACES MAINTAIN QUASI SPHERES DURING EVAPORATION AND DO NOT WET THE SURFACE. THEREFORE, THE DROPLET EVAPORATION REPLACES THE DIFFUSION AND CONCENTRATES MOLECULES ONTO THE SENSITIVE REGIONS OF THE NANOANTENNA, BECOMING THE DOMINANT MECHANISM OF MASS TRANSFER. THE DROPLET EVAPORATION TIME IS NOT ONLY MUCH SHORTER THAN THE DIFFUSION TIME BUT ALSO CAN BE ACTIVELY CONTROLLED, WHICH IS AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT. THE COMBINATION OF PLASMONICS AND SUPER-HYDROPHOBIC SURFACES OFFERS A UNIQUE SOLUTION TO THE AFOREMENTIONED KEY CHALLENGE AND HOLDS THE PROMISING FOR ULTRALOW AND ULTRASENSITIVE BIOSENSING PLATFORMS ENABLED BY CRISPR.

STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THAT UP TO TWO-THIRDS OF PATIENTS WHO SEEK STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL AND/OR PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS TO EMOTIONAL DISORDERS WILL NOT RESPOND. NONINVASIVE NEUROSTIMULATION METHODS, SUCH AS TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (TMS), ARE EMERGING TECHNIQUES TO TREAT PATIENTS WHO HAVE FAILED MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS OF STANDARD INTERVENTIONS. HOWEVER, ISSUES OF VARIABLE RESPONSE EFFECTS AND INTER-SUBJECT VARIABILITY HAVE ARISEN IN NUMEROUS INVESTIGATIONS OF TREATING DEPRESSION AND OTHER MENTAL ILLNESSES, WHICH HAVE PREVENTED THE BROAD APPLICATION OF NONINVASIVE NEUROSTIMULATION FOR CLINICAL USE. THIS EPSCOR RESEARCH FELLOWS RII TRACK-4:NSF FELLOWSHIP WILL ENABLE THE PI FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA, TO PARTNER WITH PSYCHIATRISTS AND SCIENTISTS AT THE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA TO DEVELOP A NOVEL NEUROSTIMULATION TECHNOLOGY THAT IS INTEGRATED WITH NEUROIMAGING IN A CLOSED-LOOP DESIGN. THIS RESEARCH AND THE ASSOCIATED PARTNERSHIPS WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR DEVELOPING INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT WITH MUCH IMPROVED OUTCOMES IN PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. THIS SUCCESS CAN BE FURTHER GENERALIZED TO THE NEUROSTIMULATION TREATMENT OF OTHER DISORDERS.

THE GOAL OF THIS FELLOWSHIP PROJECT IS TO GATHER EXPERIMENTAL DATA ABOUT INTERACTIONS OF NEON IONS WITH HYDROGEN AND HELIUM GAS COMMONLY FOUND IN RELEVANT ASTROPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS. THESE DATA WILL BOTH IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BASIC ATOMIC PHYSICS OF HIGHLY CHARGED IONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE USE OF THE DATA COLLECTED BY FUTURE LARGE SPACE OBSERVATORIES.

THIS WILL ENABLE THEM TO PASS THIS KNOWLEDGE ON AND TO TRAIN GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT UNH IN THESE FIELDS. CHARGE EXCHANGE, A PROCESS IN WHICH A HIGHLY CHARGED ION CAPTURES AN ELECTRON FROM A NEUTRAL ATOM, PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MANY ASTROPHYSICAL PLASMAS. IT IS A RECOMBINATION PROCESS THAT RESULTS IN EMISSION LINE INTENSITIES THAT DIFFER FROM COLLISIONAL EXCITATION, AND CAN SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC OF THE IONIZATION BALANCE AND COMPOSITION OF A PLASMA.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: THE NEURAL CIRCUITS IN THE MAMMALIAN CORTEX PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN HIGHER BRAIN FUNCTION. DUE TO THE LIMITED THICKNESS OF THE MOUSE CORTEX (ORGANIZED IN 6 HORIZONTAL LAYERS IN ~1 MM DEPTH) AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT CORTICAL AREAS (~ SEVERAL MILLIMETERS), MOST OF THE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED METHODS FOR BRAIN FUNCTIONAL IMAGING ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY STUDY THE LAYER-SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS WITHIN THE CORTEX. THIS IS DUE TO AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING MAJOR LIMITATIONS: LIMITED FIELD OF VIEW, SHALLOW PENETRATION DEPTH, LIMITED SPATIAL AND/OR TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. TO INVESTIGATE THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) LAYER-SPECIFIC INTERACTION IN THE MOUSE CORTEX AND BETWEEN DIFFERENT CORTICAL AREAS IN VIVO, THE RESEARCHER DEVELOPED A NOVEL MESOSCOPIC IMAGING TECHNIQUE THAT CAN ACHIEVE A RESOLUTION OF ~30-100 ?M WITH MILLIMETERS IMAGING DEPTH. ON THE OTHER HAND, RECENT ADVANCES IN THREE-PHOTON MICROSCOPY HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO IMAGE THROUGH THE MOUSE CORTEX FOR BOTH STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO: 1) VALIDATE THIS NOVEL MESOSCOPIC 3D IMAGING METHOD USING THE STATE-OF-ART THREE-PHOTON MICROSCOPY AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY; AND 2) INVESTIGATE THE FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE LAYER-SPECIFIC PROJECTIONS IN WHISKER SENSORIMOTOR CIRCUIT. IN ADDITION TO VALIDATING THE MESOSCOPIC IMAGING SYSTEM, THE STUDY HAS POTENTIAL TO HELP UNCOVER THE LAYER-SPECIFIC NEURAL FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX AND PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX BY COMBINING BOTH THE ADVANCED IMAGING METHODS AND OPTOGENETIC CONTROL STRATEGY. THESE NOVEL IMAGING PLATFORMS WILL ENABLE NEUROSCIENTISTS TO INVESTIGATE THE 3D NEURAL CONNECTIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT CORTICAL REGIONS OF LIVE ANIMALS.

IN CONTRAST TO DYES AND PIGMENTS, STRUCTURAL COLORS DO NOT ABSORB LIGHT BUT INSTEAD REFLECT IT FROM A MICROSCOPICALLY STRUCTURED SURFACE. THE WAVELENGTHS OF REFLECTED LIGHT DEPENDING ON THE ORIENTATION OF THE OBJECT AND THE VIEWING ANGLE, CAUSING THE SHIMMERY, COLOR-SHIFTING EFFECT OF IRIDESCENCE. THIS STRUCTURAL COLOR CAN BE ALSO PRODUCED BY ASSEMBLING SPHERICAL PARTICLES (200-500 NM) INTO CLOSE-PACKED CRYSTALS ON SURFACES. THE LOCAL ORDERING OF THE PARTICLES WITHIN A COLLOIDAL CRYSTAL IS GOVERNED BY THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PARTICLES, AND THEIR PARTICLE PACKING EFFICIENCY. WHILE MOST OF THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES AIM AT MAXIMIZING THE SIZE OF COLLOIDAL CRYSTALS, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAP IN UNDERSTANDING THE FACTORS GOVERNING LOCAL ORDER AND ITS IMPACT ON STRUCTURAL COLOR. THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING EXISTS DUE TO A COMPLEX INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS USED IN THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS AND THE CORRESPONDING STRUCTURE OBTAINED. UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CRYSTAL ORDER OF COLLOIDAL PARTICLES AND THE EXPERIMENTAL PROCESSING PARAMETERS IS THE FOCUS OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL. THIS PROPOSAL WILL INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE LOCAL ASSEMBLY FORMED BY SPHERICAL NANOPARTICLES UPON THE ADDITION OF ROD-SHAPED PARTICLES, AND THEIR CORRESPONDING ON THE BRILLIANCE OF STRUCTURAL COLOR. THE PROJECT WILL OUTLINE A GENERAL STRATEGY FOR SYNTHESIZING SURFACE COATINGS WITH NEVER FADING COLORS, WHICH IS NOT THE CASE FOR DYE OR PIGMENT-BASED PAINTS. THE MAJORITY OF CURRENTLY USED MATERIALS ARE THE GROUND STATE, EQUILIBRIUM PHASES OF THE ASSEMBLED NANOPARTICLES, WHICH HAVE WELL-DEFINED PROPERTIES BUT ARE BOUND BY THE LIMITS OF THERMODYNAMICS. TO PUSH THE LIMITS OF MATERIAL DESIGN AND ENCODE UNUSUAL PROPERTIES IN THE MESOSCOPIC MATERIALS, WE NEED TO LOOK BEYOND THE CONVENTIONAL EQUILIBRIUM MATERIALS INTO THE DOMAIN OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM ASSEMBLIES OF NON-SPHERICAL PARTICLES. CURRENTLY, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE FORMATION OF ASSEMBLIES OF NON-SPHERICAL COLLOIDS, AND EVEN LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR STRUCTURE-PROPERTY-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS. THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP EXISTS DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITY OF THE INTERPARTICLE INTERACTIONS INVOLVED IN THE ASSEMBLY OF NON-SPHERICAL PARTICLES, CORRESPONDING DYNAMICS, AND CONTROL PARAMETERS. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS AT UNDERSTANDING THESE ASPECTS USING RODS AND SPHERES AS MODEL NANOPARTICLES. THE PROPOSAL WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS: (A) HOW DO NON-SPHERICAL PARTICLES INTERACT? AND WHICH FACTORS INFLUENCE THE INTERPARTICLE INTERACTIONS? (B) WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE PRESENCE OF NON-SPHERICAL PARTICLES ON THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF SPHERICAL NANOPARTICLES? (C) HOW DOES THE CHANGE IN LOCAL CRYSTALLINE ORDER AFFECT THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ASSEMBLED MATERIAL? THESE QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED BY PERFORMING SYSTEMATIC EXPERIMENTS ON GOLD NANORODS AND NANOSPHERES AND FOLLOWING THEIR ASSEMBLY DYNAMICS/KINETICS USING LIQUID-PHASE TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (AT PACIFIC NORTHWESTERN NATIONAL LABORATORY) AND X-RAY/LIGHT SCATTERING (AT LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY).

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO BUILD TRUST IN AI-ENABLED COMPLEX SYSTEMS FOR SAFETY-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS. THIS TRUST COULD BE BUILT BY MEANS OF SOME OFFLINE OR ONLINE VALIDATION PROCESSES. THE DRAWBACK OF ONLINE VERIFICATION METHODS IS THAT THEY REQUIRE SOME FORM OF REAL-WORLD DEPLOYMENTS WHICH COULD BE UNSAFE AND RISKY.

THIS AIM WILL BE ACHIEVED VIA A HIGHLY ACCURATE LARGE-SCALE ACCELERATED MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION TECHNIQUE DEVELOPED AT THE HOST LAB, OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY. SUCH A TECHNIQUE WILL ALLOW THE PI AND HER GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO CLOSELY EXAMINE THE INTERACTION OF IONIC POLYMERS TO ACQUIRE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR SELF-HEALING PROCESS WHILE ALSO ENHANCING THE RESEARCH CAPABILITIES OF THE PI?S LAB.

HOWEVER, THE CONTROLLED CONVERSION OF THESE GASES INTO BASIC BUILDING BLOCK CHEMICALS IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED AT HIGH TEMPERATURES, PROMOTING THE LONG-TERM DEGRADATION OF THE CATALYST. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND HOW DEACTIVATION PATHWAYS CAN BE PREVENTED USING A NONREDUCIBLE THIN-FILM OVER-LAYER THAT CONFINES SURFACE SPECIES TO ACTIVE SITES AND LIMITS UNWANTED REACTIONS. UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, CATALYSTS WITH INCREASED STABILITY THAT CAN LOWER REACTION TEMPERATURES AND DECREASE OVERALL ENERGY CONSUMPTION. SPECIFICALLY, THE PI WILL PARTNER WITH OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY TO OBSERVE THE FORMATION AND MOVEMENT OF REACTING SURFACE MOLECULES AND THE IMPACT OF THESE PHENOMENA ON THE EVOLVING CATALYST STRUCTURE AND ITS DEGRADATION.

THE SKILLS DEVELOPED DURING THIS PROJECT WILL BE USED TO ENHANCE THE CURRENT SUITE OF TOOLS AT LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY TO PROBE OTHER INDUSTRIALLY RELEVANT REACTIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE REGIONAL ECONOMY. UTILIZING CO2-BASED FEEDSTOCKS IMPACTS NUMEROUS INDUSTRIALLY RELEVANT CHEMICAL PROCESSES, SUCH AS DRY REFORMING OF METHANE. TO MAXIMIZE CONVERSION, CATALYSTS ARE ENGINEERED FOR HIGH SURFACE AREAS AND METAL SITE DISPERSIONS. HOWEVER, THE REACTION CONDITIONS NEEDED TO OVERCOME THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM LIMITATIONS RESULT IN THE INSTABILITY OF CATALYST STRUCTURES PRONE TO COKING AND UNDESIRABLE SIDE REACTIONS. THE MECHANISMS BEHIND METAL RIPENING AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT EFFECTS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD, AND IN SOME STUDIES, LARGE CHANGES IN METAL DISPERSION CAN HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON CATALYST PERFORMANCE. THE PI HYPOTHESIZES THAT METAL CLUSTERS DEPOSITED ON A CATALYST SUBSTRATE CAN BE STABILIZED USING A POROUS, NONREDUCIBLE THIN FILM TO LIMIT METAL SURFACE DIFFUSION AND GROWTH AND ADSORBATE SPILLOVER. LIMITING SUBSTRATE/METAL RIPENING REDUCES COKE-DERIVED DEACTIVATION AND MAINTAINS HIGH METAL DISPERSIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CATALYTIC ACTIVITY.

TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL OF THIS EXCESS SLUDGE COMPRISE HALF OF THE TOTAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT COST, EXCEEDING $2 BILLION PER YEAR WITH A STEADY 1% ANNUAL INCREASE. A COMMON PRACTICE TO STABILIZE WASTE SLUDGE IS ANAEROBIC DIGESTION (AD) PRIOR TO DISPOSAL. THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE DESCRIBED AS THE MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATION OF SLUDGE INTO BIOGAS IN THE ABSENCE OF FREE OXYGEN. THE BIOGAS PRODUCED FROM AD IS A VALUABLE GREEN FUEL, AND IT HAS COMPARABLE CALORIFIC VALUE TO NATURAL GAS. FURTHERMORE, THE DIGESTED SLUDGE BECOMES EASIER TO TRANSPORT AND DISPOSE OF AFTER AD. DESPITE THESE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES, AD HAS LONG REACTION TIMES, AND LOW PROCESS YIELDS.

SUPERPARAMAGNETIC IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES (SPIONS) ARE GROUND-BREAKING NANOMATERIALS WITH REMARKABLE APPLICATION POTENTIAL IN A MULTITUDE OF INDUSTRIES. SPIONS CAN RESPOND TO MAGNETIC DOMAINS RAPIDLY AND EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT REMANENCE. IN ADDITION, THEY CAN HEAT RAPIDLY UNDER MICROWAVE (MW) IRRADIATION. THEIR PROPERTIES MAKE THEM PROMISING CANDIDATES FOR SLUDGE PRETREATMENT APPLICATIONS. FIRST, THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BIND TO COMPONENTS OF SLUDGE FLOC ASSEMBLIES AND DELIVER IMMEDIATE AND INTENSE MW HEATING STRATEGICALLY TO CELLS OR EXTRACELLULAR POLYMERS. MW IRRADIATION CREATES AN OSCILLATING ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD THAT CAUSES SPIONS TO HAVE BOTH THEIR ELECTRICAL DIPOLE MOMENTS AND THEIR MAGNETIC MOMENTS ROTATE, CREATING INTERNAL VIBRATIONS THAT DISSIPATE ENERGY IN THE FORM OF HEAT LOCALLY. SECOND, DUE TO THEIR SIZE (TYPICALLY <50 NM) SPIONS HAVE SPIN ELECTRONS PACKED WITHIN A MINUSCULE PHYSICAL DOMAIN THAT CAN RESPOND TO THE MAGNETIC FIELD WITHOUT REMANENCE MAGNETISM (I.E., SHOWING PROPERTIES OF BOTH PARAMAGNETIC AND FERROMAGNETIC MATERIALS). THEREFORE, SPIONS DO NOT HAVE THE BURDEN OF MAGNETIC HYSTERESIS, WHICH EMPOWERS THEIR EFFECTIVE AND RAPID RECOVERY FROM SLURRIES EVEN IN COMPLICATED REACTOR INSTALLATIONS. THE KEY MERIT OF THIS PROPOSED STUDY IS THAT SPION PROPERTIES CAN BE STRATEGICALLY TUNED FOR SUPERIOR DIELECTRIC HEATING AND MAGNETIC REACTIVITY WHILE MAINTAINING MATERIAL INTEGRITY TO ACCOMPLISH REPEATED USE FOR MW PRETREATMENT. THROUGH THIS RII TRACK-4:NSF FELLOWSHIP, THE PI AIMS TO DEVELOP A PRACTICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL TAILOR AND EMPLOY SPIONS AS DIELECTRIC AND RECOVERABLE SUSCEPTORS FOR MW-INDUCED PRE-HYDROLYSIS OF WASTEWATER SLUDGES.

LARGE GE CRYSTALS HAVE A HIGHER VOLUME-TO-SURFACE RATIO WHICH IS ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE COLLECTION OF SIGNALS AND REJECTION OF BACKGROUNDS IN A SEARCH FOR 0??? DECAY. GERDA AND MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR HAVE PROVED THAT A GE-BASED TON-SCALE EXPERIMENT CAN BE BUILT WITH SUFFICIENT LOW-BACKGROUND THAT WILL ACHIEVE A SENSITIVITY CAPABLE OF THE POTENTIAL DISCOVERY OF 0??? DECAY. THIS RII TRACK-4 PROPOSAL WILL DEVELOP LARGE-SIZE GE RING-CONTACT (GERC) DETECTORS TO FURTHER REDUCE BACKGROUNDS, COMPLEXITY, AND COST. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE GE DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY FOR COSMOLOGY, ASTRONOMY, HOMELAND SECURITY, AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. RESULTS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE PUBLISHED IN SCHOLARLY JOURNALS AND DISSEMINATED THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE CLOSELY INTEGRATED WITH EDUCATION AND OUTREACH EFFORTS: BOTH GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL WORK ON THE PROJECT, THUS GAINING CUTTING-EDGE SKILLS AND EXPERTISE IN GE CRYSTAL PURIFICATION AND DETECTOR DEVELOPMENT. THE MAIN FOCUS OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES IS TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO PURSUE STEM MAJORS. THE SENSITIVITY GOAL FOR THE LARGE ENRICHED GE EXPERIMENT FOR NEUTRINOLESS DOUBLE BETA (0???) DECAY (LEGEND-1000) REQUIRES A BACKGROUND LEVEL OF ?1?10^(-5) EVENTS/KEV/KG/YEAR.

CURRENTLY, LEGEND-200 HAS SUCCESSFULLY TESTED INVERTED COAXIAL POINT-CONTACT (ICPC) GE DETECTORS THAT HAVE A TYPICAL MASS OF ~2 KG. TO FURTHER INCREASE THE MASS PER DETECTOR, A NEW DETECTOR CONCEPT BASED ON GERC DETECTORS IS PROMISING, AS IT CAN POTENTIALLY BE USED TO MAKE A GE DETECTOR AS LARGE AS ~6 KG. ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN MODELED, A GERC DETECTOR HAS YET TO BE FABRICATED AND TESTED FOR ITS ENERGY RESOLUTION AND PULSE SHAPE PROPERTIES. THE DEGRADATION OF ENERGY RESOLUTION SEEN WITH GE DETECTORS THAT IS DUE TO INCOMPLETE CHARGE COLLECTION IN LARGE-SIZE GE CRYSTALS WILL ALSO BE AN OBSTACLE FOR LEGEND-1000. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP TO RESOLVE THREE KEY CHALLENGES: FABRICATION OF A GERC DETECTOR WITH A MASS OF ~2 ? 3 KG, MEASUREMENT OF THE ENERGY RESOLUTION AND PULSE SHAPE DISCRIMINATION IN A LARGE-SIZE GERC DETECTOR, AND ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITY OF USD-GROWN CRYSTALS.

IT HAS SEVERAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON DRAG AND LIFT THAT ARE CRITICAL TO ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS, AIRCRAFT MANEUVERABILITY, TURBINE NOISE, AND VIBRATION, ETC. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS MOTIVATED BY THE OBSERVATION THAT DERMAL DENTICLES (TOUGH SCALES) ON SHARK SKIN SHOW PROMISING PERFORMANCE IN REDUCING HYDRODYNAMIC DRAG. THE ABILITY OF SHARKS? UNIQUE SKIN IN THE FISH WORLD TO DYNAMICALLY RESPOND TO THE FLOW OFFERS A SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGE OVER CURRENT FLOW CONTROL TECHNIQUES.

WHEN FLOW IS ATTACHED, DENTICLES RETURN TO THE NON-BRISTLED POSITION AND FORM A RIBLET-LIKE TEXTURE TO REDUCE FRICTION DRAG. THIS MOTION LEADS TO A FLOW-DEPENDENT ANISOTROPIC (OR DIRECTIONAL) FUNCTION OF THE DENTICLES THAT INDICATES A PASSIVE, FLOW-ACTIVATED SEPARATION CONTROL TECHNIQUE. CURRENT APPROACHES, DESIGNED FOR STATIONARY SURFACE ROUGHNESS, ARE INSUFFICIENT TO UNDERSTAND OR PREDICT THE COMPLEX FLOWS MODULATED BY MOVABLE MICROSTRUCTURES. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS FELLOWSHIP IS TO SUPPORT THE PI?S TRAINING AND COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AT THE CTR. THE TRAINING AND RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON THE CUTTING-EDGE FLUID-STRUCTURE INTERACTION SIMULATION METHODS AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A NOVEL WALL MODEL FOR THE PREDICTION OF COMPLEX EFFECTS REPRESENTED BY SURFACE MICROSTRUCTURES. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES INCLUDE: (I) TO GENERATE AN UNPRECEDENTED DATASET OF FLOWS OVER MOVABLE ANISOTROPIC MICROSTRUCTURES, (II) TO GAIN A NEW FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING ABOUT NON-LINEAR INTERACTIONS, (III) TO SYNTHESIZE THE UNDERSTANDING TO DEVELOP TRULY PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR DRAG AND MOMENTUM FLUX.

ONE TYPE OF COMPARTMENT IS THE CHLOROPLAST, WHICH IN ADDITION TO PARTICIPATING IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS, ALSO GENERATES SIGNALING MOLECULES THAT TURN ON GENES IN THE NUCLEUS, A PROCESS KNOWN AS RETROGRADE SIGNALING. THIS RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT RII TRACK-4 FELLOWSHIP WILL INVESTIGATE HOW CHLOROPLAST RETROGRADE SIGNALING IN LIVING CELLS OPERATES DURING PLANT IMMUNITY, AND HOW PATHOGENS INTERFERE WITH THIS PROCESS. THIS RESEARCH REQUIRES ADVANCED MICROSCOPY INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE AT THE HOST INSTITUTION, THE DONALD DANFORTH PLANT SCIENCE CENTER, WHERE THE RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED. THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR A HISPANIC FEMALE FACULTY AND A HISPANIC GRADUATE STUDENT. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM THIS PROJECT WILL INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE PLANT DEFENSE RESPONSES TO CONTROL PLANT DISEASES AND REDUCE THEIR ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL IMPACT. CHLOROPLASTS HAVE EMERGED AS IMPORTANT ORGANELLES IN PLANT IMMUNITY, BOTH AS A SOURCE OF DEFENSE SIGNALING MOLECULES, AND AS MAJOR REGULATORS OF DEFENSE RESPONSES. IN RESPONSE TO PATHOGENS, CHLOROPLASTS RE-LOCALIZE AROUND THE NUCLEUS, PRESUMABLY TO FACILITATE RETROGRADE SIGNALING, A PROCESS BY WHICH SIGNALING MOLECULES ORIGINATING IN CHLOROPLASTS ACTIVATE GENE EXPRESSION IN THE NUCLEUS. WHILE RETROGRADE SIGNALING HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED, IT IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD HOW IT OPERATES DURING PLANT IMMUNITY. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS FELLOWSHIP IS TO DISSECT THE CELLULAR AND REGULATORY EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHLOROPLAST RETROGRADE SIGNALING DURING PLANT IMMUNITY BY 1) DELINEATING HOW BACTERIAL PATHOGENS WITH DISTINCT LIFESTYLES IMPACT CHLOROPLAST DYNAMICS, 2) CHARACTERIZING THE CHLOROPLAST-NUCLEAR COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATED WITH PLANT DEFENSE RESPONSES, AND 3) EVALUATING SIGNAL-DEPENDENT GENE EXPRESSION IN SITU. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED REQUIRES ADVANCED LIVE-IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES TO MONITOR CHLOROPLAST DYNAMICS AND CHLOROPLAST-MEDIATED RESPONSES AFTER INFECTION WITH BACTERIAL PATHOGENS. THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CELLULAR PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH PLANT IMMUNITY TO ENABLE GUIDED STRATEGIES TO CONTROL PLANT DISEASES.

HUMAN-CAUSED WARMING INCREASES THE ?DRYNESS? OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND, ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL, INCREASES EVAPORATION RATES FROM PLANT AND SOIL SURFACES, WHICH IN TURN INCREASES THE LOSS OF SOIL MOISTURE AND WORSENS NATURALLY OCCURRING PRECIPITATION DEFICITS. DROUGHT REDUCES THE PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND PRODUCTIVITY OF PLANTS, INCLUDING IN BOTH NATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEMS, BUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH HUMAN-CAUSED ECOLOGICAL CHANGE HAS AMPLIFIED THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON PLANT PRODUCTIVITY STILL REMAINS UNCLEAR. THIS EPSCOR RII TRACK-4:NSF FELLOWSHIP WILL COMBINE STATE-OF-THE-ART SATELLITE AND GROUND-BASED PLANT OBSERVATIONS WITH OBSERVED AND MODELED CLIMATE DATA TO EXAMINE HOW MUCH THE PAST CENTURY OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAS WORSENED DROUGHT EFFECTS ON PLANTS, FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF NATURAL- VS. HUMAN-CAUSED EFFECTS DURING TWO RECENT SEVERE DROUGHTS: THE 2012-2015 CALIFORNIA DROUGHT AND THE 2012 MIDWEST DROUGHT. THE PROJECT WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON EARTH?S ECOSYSTEMS ARE AMPLIFIED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, AND IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES THROUGH TRAINING OF A POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED LABORATORY EXERCISES FOR COURSES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA. DROUGHTS ARE AMONG THE WORLD?S COSTLIEST NATURAL DISASTERS, CAUSING SEVERE DAMAGE TO BOTH SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. ANTHROPOGENIC WARMING EXACERBATES NATURAL PRECIPITATION DEFICITS THROUGH HEAT-INDUCED INCREASES IN EVAPORATIVE DEMAND, WHICH FURTHER DRIES SOILS AND STRESSES VEGETATION. ANTHROPOGENIC INCREASES IN THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF DROUGHTS LIKELY EXERT LARGE, BUT STILL POORLY CONSTRAINED, IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, INCLUDING PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND GROWTH OF PLANTS (?PRIMARY PRODUCTION?). WHILE DROUGHT CLEARLY REDUCES VEGETATION HEALTH AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION, THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF NATURAL VARIABILITY AND ANTHROPOGENIC FORCING REMAIN UNKNOWN. USING THE SEVERE 2012-2015 CALIFORNIA AND 2012 MIDWEST DROUGHTS AS CASE STUDIES, THIS PROJECT WILL QUANTIFY THE PROPORTION OF DROUGHT-INDUCED PRIMARY PRODUCTION LOSS THAT WAS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE, INCLUDING ATTRIBUTION TO SPECIFIC CLIMATIC DRIVERS (TEMPERATURE, VAPOR PRESSURE DEFICIT, SOIL MOISTURE, AND SOLAR RADIATION). THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT ANTHROPOGENIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO DROUGHT-INDUCED LOSS OF PRIMARY PRODUCTION WERE EVEN GREATER THAN ANTHROPOGENIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO LOSS OF SOIL MOISTURE DUE TO THE DIRECT NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND EVAPORATIVE DEMAND ON STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED USING STATE-OF-THE-ART REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES (E.G., SOLAR-INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE) AND CLIMATE CHANGE ATTRIBUTION METHODS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AN EMPIRICAL ?GLOBAL CHANGE ECOLOGY? ATTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK THAT WILL BE PORTABLE TO OTHER ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AND OTHER IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, INCLUDING FOLLOW-UP WORK FOCUSED ON THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON NATIONWIDE CHANGES IN PRIMARY PRODUCTION.

SCIENTISTS PRESENTLY UNDERSTAND THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MACHINERY REQUIRED FOR THESE ASPECTS OF BRAIN FUNCTION, WHICH INCLUDE THE MOLECULAR COMPLEX THAT THIS PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON, CALLED THE VESICULAR ACETYLCHOLINE TRANSPORTER (VACHT). VACHTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING ACETYLCHOLINE INTO SYNAPTIC VESICLES INSIDE NERVE TERMINALS SO THAT IT CAN BE RELEASED ONTO ITS TARGET CELLS. HOWEVER, THE DETAILED MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH VACHTS MEDIATE THIS TRANSPORT PROCESS REMAIN UNCLEAR, AS DOES THE ROLE THAT VACHT-RELATED CHANGES IN ACETYLCHOLINE RELEASE MAY PLAY IN REGULATING BEHAVIORAL CHANGES. THIS PROJECT USES THE OUTSTANDING GENETIC RESOURCES THAT FRUIT FLIES POSSESS FOR STUDYING THE ACETYLCHOLINE REGULATION SYSTEM TO DETERMINE HOW CHANGES IN VACHT AFFECT ACETYLCHOLINE RELEASE AND THE REGULATION OF THE BEHAVIORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THIS PROJECT ALSO UTILIZES A WIDE RANGE OF SOPHISTICATED TOOLS AND METHODOLOGIES (INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO RECORD ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY FROM FLY BRAIN CELLS) TO TRAIN UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDER-REPRESENTED MINORITY BACKGROUNDS, EQUIPPING THEM WITH AN UP-TO-DATE SET OF TRANSFERRABLE SKILLS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH (STEM), AND BROADENING THE PARTICIPATION OF MINORITIES IN THE ADVANCED STEM WORKFORCE. THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES A STRONG FOCUS ON RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION OF K-12 STUDENTS THROUGH A VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE HOW SPECIFIC CHANGES IN THE VESICULAR ACETYLCHOLINE TRANSPORTER (VACHT) ALTER ACETYLCHOLINE (ACH) RELEASE BY USING A COLLECTION OF GENETIC ALTERATIONS AVAILABLE IN DROSOPHILA. A VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTS EMPLOYING THIS MUTATION AND OVEREXPRESSION COLLECTION WILL HELP ELUCIDATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACH RELEASE AND ACH-LINKED BEHAVIORS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AN INVERTED V-SHAPED MODEL UNDERLIES ACH SYNAPTIC RELEASE, SUCH THAT STRONG DECREASES IN OR OVEREXPRESSION OF THE TRANSPORTER CAUSE SEVERE DEFECTS IN SYNAPTIC PHYSIOLOGY AND ACH-LINKED BEHAVIOR, WHILE MILD INCREASES IN VACHT EXPRESSION WILL ENHANCE SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY. THE WORK WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS USING THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1 WILL DETERMINE HOW SPECIFIC CHANGES IN VACHT AFFECT THAT PROTEIN?S EXPRESSION, ITS ACTIVITY, AND THE LEVELS OF ACH. AIM 2 IS FOCUSED ON DETERMINING HOW CHANGES IN VACHT EXPRESSION AFFECT SYNAPTIC VESICLES (SV) BY TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT GRADED INCREASES IN VACHT UPREGULATE BOTH SV RELEASE AND SV FUSION. AIM 3 WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF GRADED CHANGES IN VACHT FUNCTION ON ACH-LINKED BEHAVIORS. ALTOGETHER, THE PROJECT WILL ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH VACHT ULTIMATELY HELPS TO MEDIATE SYNAPTIC RELEASE.

IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 30% OF NEWLY ELECTRIFIED CONNECTIONS WILL BE SERVED BY MICROGRIDS BY 2030 (UP TO 70% IN RURAL AREAS). NUMEROUS MICROGRID PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS EXIST. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN NETWORK DESIGN METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THESE TOOLS. SUCH INCONSISTENCIES AND UNCERTAINTY IN BEST PRACTICES ARE DETRIMENTAL TO THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF SUSTAINABLE AND STABLE MICROGRIDS NECESSARY TO MEET THE UN SUSTAINABILITY DEVELOPMENT GOAL #7.

WATER, NUTRIENT, AND AGROCHEMICAL M -MODERN FARMERS FACE AN EVER-GROWING LIST OF CHALLENGES. MANY OF THESE ISSUES, SUCH AS MORE SEVERE WEATHER, WILL REQUIRE THEM TO CHANGE HOW THEY FARM. CREATING A PROTECTIVE LAYER OVER SOIL WHEN GROWING FIELD CROPS COULD HELP FARMERS BETTER MANAGE MANY ISSUES AT ONCE. COVERING SOIL WITH SHEET PLASTIC PREVENTS WEED GROWTH, EROSION, AND MOISTURE LOSS. BUT, USING LARGE AMOUNTS PLASTIC CREATES WASTE, IS NOT ECO-FRIENDLY, AND TOO COSTLY FOR FIELD CROPS. NEW LOCALLY SOURCED TYPES OF BIOPLASTICS THAT FULLY BREAK DOWN INTO TO SAFE BY-PRODUCTS CAN BE MADE. THESE NEW MATERIALS COULD PROVIDE FARMERS WITH A GREEN WAY TO CONTROL WEEDS, FERTILIZE CROPS, PROTECT SOIL AND WATER RESOURCES, AND WORK WITH NATURE TO BETTER MANAGE THEIR FIELDS. THIS NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT TRACK-2 FOCUSED EPSCOR COLLABORATIONS (NSF RII TRACK-2 FEC) AWARD WILL BE A NEW PARTNERSHIP CALLED BIOWRAP BETWEEN KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY, SOUTH DAKOTA SCHOOL OF MINES AND TECHNOLOGY, AND UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA. THIS PROJECT WILL BE FOCUSED ON ADVANCING FARM USE OF BIOPLASTICS. TEAMS WILL DO THIS BY LINKING NATURAL AND MAN-MADE SYSTEMS, STOPPING HARMFUL WEED-CROP-TILL CYCLES, AND HELPING BUILD GREEN RURAL INDUSTRIES. THE TEAM WILL USE LAB AND FIELD TRIALS, NOVEL ANALYTICS AND PRODUCTS, AND THE LINKS BETWEEN PEOPLE, FARMS, INDUSTRIES, AND NATURAL SYSTEMS TO HELP CHANGE HOW WE GROW FIELD CROPS FOR THE BETTER. OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE AN ALL-IN-ONE SYSTEM THAT CAN BETTER MANAGE WEEDS, NUTRIENTS, SOILS, AND WATER RESOURCES. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR FIVE EARLY CAREER FACULTY AND THREE POST-DOCS. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE LEARNING RESOURCES TO STUDENTS OF ALL AGES AND PEOPLE ON FARMS AND IN RURAL AREAS. THIS RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT TRACK-2 FOCUSED EPSCOR COLLABORATIONS (RII TRACK-2 FEC) AWARD WILL BE A NEW PARTNERSHIP FOCUSED ON A PROJECT CALLED BIOWRAP (BIOPLASTICS WITH REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURAL PROPERTIES) BETWEEN KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY, SOUTH DAKOTA SCHOOL OF MINES AND TECHNOLOGY, AND UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REDUCE THE USE OF CONVENTIONAL PLASTICS, HERBICIDES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. THIS GOAL WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INTEGRATED THRUST AREAS: (I) CREATE A SET OF BIO-BASED POLYMERS THAT CAN BE USED IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION; (II) MEASURE THE AGRICULTURAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE TECHNOLOGY; AND (III) ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES AND THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY ALONG WITH ESTABLISHING A CONSORTIUM FOR SUSTAINED COLLABORATIONS AMONG UNIVERSITY PARTNERS IN KANSAS, SOUTH DAKOTA, AND NEBRASKA IN THE FIELD OF SPRAY-ON BIOPOLYMER BASED FILMS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. THE RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE: ENGINEERING BIOPOLYMERS INCLUDED FUNCTIONALIZED PHA-BASED BIOPOLYMERS, PROTEIN BASED SPRAYABLE BIOPOLYMERS, AND HYBRID POLYMER SYSTEMS; STUDYING THE IMPACT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY ON STRENGTHENING OF AGROECOSYSTEMS BY EVALUATION OF BIOPOLYMER WITH RESPECT TO WEED SUPPRESSION AND CROP PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY, NUTRIENT CYCLING, SOIL MOISTURE RETENTION AND LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING; AND ASSESSING THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THE NEW BIOWRAP TECHNOLOGY USING SOCIO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF PRODUCT ADOPTION AND RURAL SUSTAINABILITY ALONG WITH VALUING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY BIOWRAP, ECOSYSTEM SERVICE MARKET DESIGN AND PARTICIPATION AND ITS IMPACT ON SOCIO-ECONOMICS OF PARTICIPATING EPSCOR STATES AS WELL AS OVERALL SUSTAINABLE DATA PROVISION OF THE PROJECT. THE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES DESIGNED FOR THE PROJECT ENABLE INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT AND POTENTIAL CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN INDUSTRIES. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES MENTORING OF FIVE JUNIOR FACULTY AND THREE POST DOCS BY SENIOR FACULTY IN ADVANCING THROUGH THEIR CAREERS AND GUIDING STUDENTS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF EDUCATION (GRADUATE, UNDERGRADUATE, AND HIGH AND MIDDLE SCHOOL) AND ENGAGING WITH RURAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH FIELD DAYS, SURVEYS, INTERVIEWS, AND EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH ACTIVITIES.

THE SCIENTIFIC WORK IS UNITED BY A COMMON SET OF TECHNIQUES FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS. MOREOVER, THE COMMON APPROACH IS TO: 1) USE UNMANNED FLYING VEHICLES CALLED DRONES TO COLLECT PICTURES AND OTHER MEASUREMENTS. WHILE THE INFORMATION ACQUIRED BY DRONES IS HIGH QUALITY, IT IS ALSO A LARGE AMOUNT OF COMPLEX DATA. 2) TO AID IN THE DATA?S INTERPRETATION AND ADDRESS THE SCIENCE QUESTIONS, WE USE MACHINE LEARNING METHODS THAT TRAIN COMPUTERS TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS IN DATA. COLLECTING DATA USING DRONES AND THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING ARE CRITICAL SKILLS FOR AMERICA?S FUTURE WORKFORCE. OUR ACTIVITIES ARE ALIGNED WITH CAREER TRAINING THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL COMPANIES AND INTERNSHIPS FOR PARTICIPATING STUDENTS. WITH THE EMPHASIS ON INTERNSHIPS, THE FOCUS WILL BE RETENTION, RATHER THAN RECRUITMENT OF STUDENTS. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS WILL WORK IN TANDEM WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO ENSURE THAT INDIGENOUS, LOW INCOME, AND RURAL MEMBERS OF OUR JURISDICTIONS ARE INTEGRAL TO THE EFFORTS. IT IS PROPOSED TO USE MACHINE LEARNING (ML) TO PROCESS IMAGERY AND OTHER DATA ACQUIRED BY AUTONOMOUS AERIAL SYSTEMS (UAS). PROCESSED DATA WILL SUPPORT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT BY PROVIDING A CLEAR MEANS OF TESTING HYPOTHESES. THE THREE AREAS OF NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TO APPLY THIS APPROACH ARE: 1) SNOW WATER RESOURCES, BECAUSE ENERGY PRODUCTION, AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH REQUIRE IMPROVED ASSESSMENT OF THE NATURAL CAPITAL BANKED IN THE MOUNTAIN SNOWPACK. 2) FIRE MANAGEMENT AND SCIENCE, BECAUSE AN ADVANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICAL AND ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES DRIVING WILDFIRE IS REQUIRED FOR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT BETTER PROTECT FORESTS AND THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THEM. 3) ABANDONED OIL WELL MONITORING, BECAUSE DETECTING AND MAPPING UNCAPPED OR IMPROPERLY SEALED OIL AND GAS WELLS WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL DATA FOR IMPROVED MITIGATION, SITE RECLAMATION, AND HAZARD REMOVAL. THE TEAM BRING TOGETHER THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA ANCHORAGE TO CONDUCT LOCALLY RELEVANT RESEARCH. THE LOCAL FOCUS STRENGTHENS THE RELATIONS WITH NEARBY COMMERCIAL INTERESTS TO IDENTIFY QUESTIONS COMMON TO ACADEMIC AND COMMERCIAL ENDEAVORS IN MODERN NATURAL RESOURCE BASED ECONOMIES. ATTENTION IS CALLED TO UAS AND ML AS SKILLS VITAL TO BOTH COMMERCIAL AND ACADEMIC WORK. TO ADVANCE THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASED ADVANCED MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES OF THE JURISDICTIONS, SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO DEVELOPING A WORKFORCE THAT SPANS FROM TWO-YEAR COLLEGE GRADUATES TO JUNIOR FACULTY MEMBERS. THIS AWARD'S PLAN CENTERS ON PAID, CREDIT-BEARING INTERNSHIPS WITH KEY PARTNERS, DRAWING COMMERCIAL INTERESTS INTO THE PROPOSED WORK, AND BRINGING JUNIOR FACULTY TO THE RESEARCH.

ATOMIC CLOCKS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, LEADING TO INNOVATIONS SUCH AS GLOBAL POSITIONING, ADVANCE COMMUNICATIONS, AND TESTS OF FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLE PHYSICS. A NEXT GENERATION OPTICAL ATOMIC CLOCK WOULD EXTEND THE CAPABILITIES OF THESE SYSTEMS AND WILL ENABLE A RENAISSANCE OF TIMING APPLICATIONS SUCH AS ENHANCED SECURITY FOR DATA ROUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS, ADVANCED EARTH AND SPACE TIME-BASED NAVIGATION, GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYING, TESTING EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY, AND SEARCHES FOR VARIATIONS IN THE FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS OF THE UNIVERSE. LASER COOLING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT UTILIZES THE MECHANICAL ACTION OF LIGHT TO REDUCE THE VELOCITY OF AN ATOM IN A GAS. THE USE OF LASERS TO COOL ATOMS OPENED UP NEW FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS RANGING FROM THE FORMATION OF NEW STATES OF MATTER TO ENABLING EMERGING QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS THE EXTENSION OF LASER COOLING TO THE PROPOSED ATOMIC SPECIES TO ENABLE ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL DISCOVERY PLATFORMS TO FACILITATE NEW SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATIONS TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS QUESTIONS RELATED TO DARK MATTER SEARCHES AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE UNIVERSE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE ATOMIC PHYSICS PROPERTIES AND IMPLEMENT LASER COOLING OF CE AND TB FOR THEIR POTENTIAL USES AS NEXT GENERATION TIME/FREQUENCY STANDARDS AND AS ULTRACOLD ENSEMBLES WITH UNIQUE PROPERTIES AND DYNAMICS. THE PROJECT WILL INVOLVE MINORITY GRADUATE, UNDERGRADUATE, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS VIA EXISTING UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA-BIRMINGHAM PROGRAMS TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THE SIMIEN SPECTROSCOPY AND LASER COOLING GROUP. ADDITIONAL OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WILL AIM TO GET K-12 STUDENTS INTERESTED IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING BY PERFORMING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY DEMONSTRATIONS AT LOCAL SCHOOLS IN THE REGION. THIS PROJECT IS AN EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM DIRECTED TOWARDS INVESTIGATING SPECTROSCOPIC, LASER COOLING, AND COLLISIONAL PROPERTIES OF ATOMIC CERIUM AND TERBIUM AS IT RELATES TO OPTICAL CLOCKS, VARIATION IN FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS FOR NEW PHYSICS SEARCHES BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL, AND DIPOLAR QUANTUM GASES. THESE ATOMS HAVE EXOTIC ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS AND LARGE GROUND STATE MAGNETIC MOMENTS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE SUBMERGED SHELL OPTICAL CLOCK TRANSITIONS THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO VARIATIONS IN THE FINE STRUCTURE CONSTANT ALPHA, AND EXOTIC QUANTUM GAS PHASES WITH PHENOMENON DOMINATED BY DIPOLE-DIPOLE INTERACTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE SPECTROSCOPIC STUDIES WILL INVOLVE MEASUREMENTS OF THE HYPERFINE STRUCTURE, ISOTOPE SHIFTS, AND RADIATIVE LIFETIMES OF STRONG ELECTRIC DIPOLE AND SPIN-FORBIDDEN TRANSITIONS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE CE AND TB HYPERFINE CONSTANTS, ISOTOPE SHIFTS, AND NATURAL LINEWIDTHS AND LIFETIMES. THE HYPERFINE CONSTANTS DEFINE THE ORDERING OF THE HYPERFINE PEAKS AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ENERGY SHIFTS FROM THE MAGNETIC DIPOLE AND ELECTRIC QUADRUPOLE INTERACTIONS. THE ISOTOPE SHIFTS ARE SMALL DEVIATIONS IN THE TRANSITION ENERGIES DUE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MASSES AND THE VOLUMES OF THE NUCLEI. THE NATURAL LINEWIDTHS AND LIFETIMES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITION RATES. THE DETERMINATION OF THESE SPECTROSCOPIC PROPERTIES ARE NECESSARY FOR IMPLEMENTING LASER COOLING AND TRAPPING OF CERIUM AND TERBIUM. FURTHERMORE, CE AND TB WILL BE LASER COOLED AS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS PERFORMING PRECISION MEASUREMENTS AND STUDYING ATOMIC DIPOLAR PHYSICS. IN ADDITION, MEASUREMENTS OF COLLISION QUENCHING CROSS SECTIONS, PRESSURE BROADENING, AND FREQUENCY SHIFTS WILL OCCUR INSIDE AN ATOMIC VAPOR CELL. THESE QUANTITIES WILL CHARACTERIZE THE COLLISION SENSITIVITY AND GIVE INSIGHT INTO THE COMBINED ACTION OF ELECTRON SCREENING AND CONFIGURATIONAL INTERACTIONS OF THE PROPOSED CE AND TB LASER COOLING AND OPTICAL CLOCK TRANSITIONS.
