FOLLOWING IDENTIFICATION, SITES WOULD MOVE THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL COMPLIANCE PROCESSES AND THEN BE CONSTRUCTED.PROJECTED DELIVERABLES OR OUTCOMES THIS IS A FIVE YEAR, MULTI PHASE PROCESS THAT STARTS BY LEVERAGING STAKEHOLDER AND COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE, AND EXISTING DATA SETS, TO IDENTIFY, PERMIT, AND INSTALL NEW SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND DATA ACQUISITION (SCADA), TELEMETRY, AND AUTOMATION HARDWARE1 AND SOFTWARE AT SITES IN KLAMATH PROJECT IRRIGATION DISTRICTS OR ELSEWHERE IN THE BASIN. NEW SCADA INSTALLATIONS WITHIN THE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS  INFRASTRUCTURE WILL ENABLE IMMEDIATE WATER MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE WATER QUALITY, QUANTITY, AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY BENEFITS THAT CAN SUPPORT PROJECT DISTRICTS AND IRRIGATORS, THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT, AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. DEPENDING ON THE SPEED OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL COMPLIANCE PROCESSES, PERMITTING, AND OTHER FACTORS, INSTALLATIONS COULD BE COMPLETED IN AS LITTLE AS THREE YEARS. RECIPIENT WILL FOCUS WITH THE GOAL OF ACCELERATING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.INTENDED BENEFICIARIES THE BENEFITS TO BE DERIVED FROM THIS COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT INCLUDE IMPROVING WATER MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES WITHIN AND BETWEEN PROJECT DISTRICTS. WITH BETTER MEASUREMENT AND VISIBILITY INTO WATER QUANTITIES MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM, AND THE ABILITY TO REMOTELY CONTROL GATES, PUMPS, AND OTHER FACILITIES, DISTRICTS WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER COORDINATE WATER MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVE OVERALL SYSTEM OPERATIONS. OPERATIONAL BENEFITS MAY INCLUDE REDUCED DIVERSIONS FROM THE KLAMATH OR LOST RIVERS, IMPROVED WATER DELIVERY EFFICIENCIES, AND REDUCED PUMPING. REDUCTIONS IN PUMPING COULD REDUCE ENERGY COSTS FOR THE DISTRICTS OR RECLAMATION. REDUCED DIVERSIONS COULD PROVIDE IN STREAM FLOW BENEFITS FOR THE RIVERS AND LISTED SPECIES IN THE BASIN. THESE BENEFITS ARE EXPECTED TO GROW OVER TIME WITH EXPERIENCE OPERATING THE SYSTEM USING AUTOMATED TOOLS. IN ADDITION, WATER MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS MAY INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER WATER TO THE LOWER KLAMATH NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE AND REDUCE THE NEED TO PUMP WATER THAT HAS BEEN USED BY AGRICULTURE BACK TO THE KLAMATH RIVER.SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES (IF KNOWN OR SPECIFIED AT TIME OF AWARD)  N A", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OR", "COVID-19
