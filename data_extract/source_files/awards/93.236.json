THE PROJECT\u2019S FOCUS IS ON AUTO-DESIGNATED DENTAL HPSAS, INCLUDING A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER AND A TRIBAL HEALTH CLINIC, WHERE THERE IS LIMITED ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN, ADULTS, OR SENIORS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE ACCESSIBILITY AND SCOPE OF ORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITHIN DENTAL HPSAS WITHOUT THE TYPICAL BRICK AND MORTAR PHYSICAL EXPANSION. THE INITIAL TARGET POPULATION WILL INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE LARGELY RURAL FRANKLIN COUNTY IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE STATE (ESPECIALLY LOW-INCOME PEOPLE, AND MIGRANT FARM WORKERS IN THE REGION) AND NATIVE AMERICANS ON TRIBAL LAND IN EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS. TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES, MDPH WILL CONDUCT ONGOING PROGRAM EVALUATION, PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND CONDUCT PLAN-DO-STUDY-ACT (PDSA) CYCLES OF IMPROVEMENT AS NECESSARY. WE WILL USE WHAT WE LEARN FROM THIS PROJECT TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES AND DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE AN IMPLEMENTATION TEMPLATE THAT CAN BE ADOPTED BY COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS TO SERVE OTHER DENTAL HPSAS AND HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE\u2014INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE URBAN, R URAL, LOW-INCOME, BLACK OR LATINX. PROJECT METHODS AND RESULTS WILL BE SHARED WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND DECISION-MAKERS WITHIN THE STATE.

THE 2018-2019 CALIFORNIA SMILE SURVEY REPORTED 61%, 22%, AND 37% OF DENTAL CARIES EXPERIENCE, UNTREATED DENTAL CARIES, AND DENTAL SEALANT PREVALENCE, RESPECTIVELY, AMONG 3RD-GRADE CHILDREN. THE HIGHEST PREVALENCE OF DENTAL CARIES (76%) AND UNTREATED DECAY (30%) WAS OBSERVED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY (SJV) COUNTIES COMPARED TO CHILDREN FROM OTHER REGIONS. TWO ESSENTIAL STRATEGIES RECOMMENDED IN THE 2018-2028 CALIFORNIA ORAL HEALTH PLAN (COHP) TO IMPROVE ORAL HEALTH AND ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE AMONG CALIFORNIANS, INCLUDING SCHOOL CHILDREN, THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THIS PROJECT ARE 1) DEVELOPING ROBUST COMMUNITY-CLINICAL LINKAGE PROGRAMS AND 2) COLLABORATION BETWEEN VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO EXPAND INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE. GOALS: THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES (UCLA) SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (SOD), AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH\u2019S (CDPH) OFFICE OF ORAL HEALTH (OOH), WILL COLLABORATE WITH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS), RURAL HEALTH CLINICS (RHCS), LOCAL ORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS (LOHPS) AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS, IN TWO SJV COUNTIES (KINGS AND STANISLAUS) TO 1) ESTABLISH AND EVALUATE AN INNOVATIVE SCHOOL-LINKED ELECTRONIC DENTAL REFERRAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EDRMS) AND CARE COORDINATION THAT LINK CHILDREN TO SCHOOL-LINKED DENTAL CARE DELIVERY SITES, AND 2) CREATE SELF-SUSTAINING COMMUNITY-BASED CLINICAL EDUCATION (CBCE) ROTATIONS FOR UCLA SOD SENIOR (D4) DENTAL STUDENTS AT SCHO OL-LINKED DENTAL CARE DELIVERY SITES. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS TWO OF THE ALLOWABLE ACTIVITIES MENTIONED IN THIS NOFO: A) ESTABLISHING SCHOOL-LINKED DENTAL FACILITIES AND B) PLACEMENT OF DENTAL STUDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY CLINICS. THREE OF THE HRSA 2019-2022 STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED BY 1) IMPROVING ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE SERVICES, 2) PREPARING A HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE ABLE TO ADDRESS CURRENT AND EMERGING NEEDS, AND 3) ENHANCING POPULATION HEALTH AND ADDRESSING DISPARITIES THROUGH COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. METHODS: TO ACHIEVE GOAL 1, UCLA SOD WILL WORK WITH THE PARTNERS MENTIONED ABOVE TO ESTABLISH AND MEASURE THE PROGRESS OF THE INNOVATIVE SCHOOL-LINKED EDRMS AND CARE COORDINATION. TO ACHIEVE GOAL 2, UCLA SOD WILL ESTABLISH AFFILIATIONS WITH THREE NEW SCHOOL-LINKED FQHC/RHC SITES TO CREATE NEW CBCE ROTATIONS FOR D4 DENTAL STUDENTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO CHILDREN REFERRED BY SCHOOL ORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS (SOHPS) AND OTHER VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED PATIENTS.
