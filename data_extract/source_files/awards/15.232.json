THIS LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT AND MITIGATE THE DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS OF POST-WILDFIRE DEBRIS FLOWS AND TO ASSESS HOW PRE-FIRE FUEL MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS INFLUENCE DEBRIS-FLOW RUNOUT. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BY TRANSITIONING PRODF, A RECENTLY DEVELOPED DEBRIS-FLOW RUNOUT MODEL, FROM A RESEARCH GRADE TOOL TO ONE THAT CAN BE USED BY DECISION MAKERS AND IMPLEMENTED INTO EXISTING PRE-FIRE HAZARD ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORKS.OBJECTIVES.PRODF IS CURRENTLY LIMITED AS A TOOL IN PRE-FIRE SCENARIOS BECAUSE IT REQUIRES TWO FLOW MOBILITY PARAMETERS THAT MUST BE CALIBRATED TO A PREVIOUS EVENT AT EVERY NEW SITE.

OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS FUEL MOISTURE, WHICH INFLUENCES THE RATE OF FUELS CONSUMPTION, FIRE FRONT INTENSITY AND RATE OF SPREAD, AND POST-FIRE SURVIVAL (RYAN ET AL., 2013). IN MANY PRESCRIBED BURNS, MANAGERS ATTEMPT TO REDUCE SURFACE FUELS, AND CAUSE MORTALITY ACROSS A GRADIENT OF TREES SIZES (NPS, NWCG). WHILE MOST MORTALITY GOALS TARGET SMALLER TREE SIZE CLASSES, IT IS COMMON FOR OBJECTIVES TO INCLUDE THE CREATION OF CROWN OPENINGS IN THE CANOPY BY KILLING PATCHES OF LARGER SIZE TREES. ACHIEVING TREE MORTALITY IS HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY A TREES FOLIAR MOISTURE CONTENT (FMC). MAPS OF TREE-LEVEL FMC WOULD ALLOW MANAGERS TO EITHER TARGET THINNING OF MOISTURE-STRESS TREES OR BETTER PRESCRIBE IGNITION PATTERNS TO ACHIEVE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES (I.E., DECREASE FOREST DENSITY, REDUCE FUEL CONNECTIVITY).UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT MODELS OF PLANT MOISTURE WERE DEVELOPED FOR COARSE SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS (10-30 M RESOLUTION), LIMITING THEIR USE IN PRESCRIPTION PLANNING (GAO, 1996). HOWEVER, RECENT ADVANCES IN UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM (UAS) IMAGING MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE COMPARABLE DATA AT  10 CM RESOLUTION. SIMILAR UAS DATA HAS BEEN USED IN AGRICULTURE TO ASSESS PLANT DROUGHT-CONDITIONS TO INFORM PRECISION IRRIGATION (EZENNE ET AL., 2019). HOWEVER, NO COMPREHENSIVE MODELS OF TREE-LEVEL FMC HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED.SINCE KNOWLEDGE OF PRE-FIRE FUEL CONDITIONS ARE LIMITED, THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A RAPID ASSESSMENT SYSTEM OF TREE-LEVEL FMC THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH MANAGERS.
