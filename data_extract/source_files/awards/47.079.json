OVER THREE YEARS, THE PROJECT WILL TRAIN 24 U.S. UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, WITH A RECRUITMENT FOCUS ON UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN STEM FIELDS. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE HOW VARIATION IN LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BY RESIDENTS AFFECTS THE INTEGRITY OF LANDSCAPE ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES, AS WELL AS HUMAN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, PARTICIPATING STUDENTS WILL CONDUCT FIELD RESEARCH ON FORESTS, BIRDS, AND PEOPLE WITHIN A FRAGMENTED TROPICAL LANDSCAPE THROUGH INTENSIVE MENTORING BY U.S. AND ECUADORIAN RESEARCHERS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE, STUDENTS WILL GAIN TRAINING IN DEVELOPING RESEARCH HYPOTHESES AND STUDY DESIGN, COLLECTING FIELD DATA, AND ANALYSIS AND DISSEMINATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS, INCLUDING IN PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS. BY TARGETING STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, THE PROJECT WILL HELP INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF IDEAS AND PERSPECTIVES ON FACTORS THAT EITHER EXACERBATE, OR AMELIORATE, THE EFFECTS OF LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH. THE RESEARCH TO BE UNDERTAKEN BY U.S. STUDENTS WILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN ECUADOR?S CHOC? BIOGEOGRAPHIC ZONE, WHERE LOCAL MANAGEMENT STYLES RANGE FROM INTENSIVE DEFORESTATION FOR AGRICULTURE AND CATTLE TO MAINTAINING HIGH TREE COVER FOR HUNTING AND SUSTAINABLE HARVEST ACTIVITIES. OUR OVER-ARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT HIGHER TREE COVER IN THIS LANDSCAPE WILL BENEFIT NATURAL SYSTEMS (VIA PROMOTING SEED DISPERSAL BY FRUIT-EATING VERTEBRATES) AND HUMAN SYSTEMS (BY IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY AND REDUCING THERMAL STRESS). TO EVALUATE HOW TREE COVER EFFECTS THE DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE, AND FORAGING OF FRUIT-EATING BIRDS, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ABLE TO COMBINE SATELLITE IMAGERY ANALYSIS WITH FIELD-BASED QUANTIFICATION OF BIRD POPULATION METRICS, MOVEMENT PATTERNS, AND FRUIT REMOVAL RATES COLLECTED VIA MIST-NETTING, RADIO-TRACKING, AND FRUITING TREES OBSERVATIONS. THESE CORRELATIONAL APPROACHES MAY BE COMPLEMENTED BY AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH NEST BOXES ARE PLACED IN A RANGE OF HABITATS TO DETERMINE IF THE AVAILABILITY OF NESTING HOLES LIMIT BIRD POPULATIONS IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS. AVIAN SEED-DISPERSAL DATA CAN ALSO BE EVALUATED IN RELATION TO FOREST STRUCTURE, ELEVATION, AND THE THERMIC ENVIRONMENT TO INVESTIGATE ITS EFFECT ON SEED DEPOSITION AND SEEDLING RECRUITMENT. TO UNDERSTAND FACTORS LIMITING VEGETATIVE REGENERATION, STUDENTS CAN STUDY THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF SEEDS ARRIVING IN SEED TRAPS; THE EFFECTS OF SEED DENSITY, LOCATION, AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF DISPERSED SEEDS ON SEEDLING GROWTH, SURVIVAL, AND DEMOGRAPHY; AND IMPACTS OF HERBIVORY THROUGH FIELD-BASED EXPERIMENTS. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TREE COVER RELATES TO HUMAN WELL-BEING, STUDENTS WILL INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF FOREST COVER IN MODERATING AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND HOW THE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT DIRECTLY (DEHYDRATION, HEAT STRESS) AND INDIRECTLY (WORK PATTERNS, FOOD SECURITY) INFLUENCES HUMAN WELL-BEING. PARTICIPANTS CAN ALSO EVALUATE HOW LAND COVER, GENDER, AND MARKET ACCESS MAY INFLUENCE DIETARY PATTERNS AND HUMAN NUTRITIONAL STATUS. THIS WILL INVOLVE DATA COLLECTION ON MACRONUTRIENT AND MICRONUTRIENT INTAKES AS WELL AS ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS OF ADULTS AND CHILDREN (HEIGHT, WEIGHT, CIRCUMFERENCES, AND BODY COMPOSITION). RESULTS FROM THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH ARE EXPECTED TO ELUCIDATE HOW INTEGRATION OF BIODIVERSITY INTO AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS MAY IMPACT BOTH ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION AND HUMAN HEALTH, THEREBY INFORMING HOW GROWING HUMAN POPULATIONS, INCREASED DEFORESTATION, AND A WARMING CLIMATE MAY AFFECT OUR PLANET AND SOCIETY.

EVEN IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF PANDEMIC ERADICATION, NEW WORK PATTERNS MAY REPLACE PRE-PANDEMIC NORMS AND PRACTICES OF INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION. WHILE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS MATTER FOR FACILITATING ADAPTATION TO THE PANDEMIC, SOCIAL INNOVATIONS AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM LEVELS ARE EQUALLY OR MORE IMPORTANT FOR GENERATING RESILIENCE WITHIN SCIENTIFIC TEAMS DURING THE PROTRACTED CRISIS. THE FUTURE OF INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE WORK CAN BENEFIT FROM AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SCIENTISTS HAVE SHOWN TEAM RESILIENCE DURING THIS TIME, STRENGTHENING TEAMS, AND MEANINGFULLY TRANSFERRING KNOWLEDGE. IN AN INCREASINGLY GLOBALIZED SCIENTIFIC LANDSCAPE THE GRAND POLICY QUESTION IS HOW TO INTERNATIONALIZE SCIENTIFIC TEAMS WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, RESPONDING TO LOCAL DEMANDS. OUR GOAL IS TO CHARACTERIZE DIFFERENT FORMS OF SOCIAL INNOVATION IN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE WORK DURING THE PANDEMIC, WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT LOCAL CONTEXTS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. PART 2. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE TOPIC OF GLOBAL SOCIAL INNOVATION IN SCIENCE CAPACITY IN THE FACE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BY EXAMINING THREE INTERTWINING FEATURES OF THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE TEAMS: SOCIAL INNOVATION, ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE, AND LEARNING AND TRANSFERABILITY. SOCIAL INNOVATION REFERS TO NEW AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF MODIFYING INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF TEAM SCIENCE. THE RESEARCH DESIGN BUILDS ON INTERDISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CONDUCT AND GROUP DYNAMICS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF TEAMS. THE PROJECT INVOLVES A SERIES OF CASE STUDIES FOCUSED AROUND DISTINCT INTERNATIONALLY COLLABORATIVE TEAMS ACROSS FOUR COUNTRIES: AUSTRIA, LATVIA, SPAIN AND THE UNITED STATES. DATA ARE DRAWN FROM BIBLIOMETRIC DATA SOURCES, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, FOCUS GROUPS, AND A SURVEY OF RESEARCHERS. TEAMS INCLUDE NEW EMERGENT COLLABORATIONS THAT ESTABLISH NORMS FOR INTERACTION DURING THE PANDEMIC, OR ADAPTIVE COLLABORATIONS THAT ADJUST TO THE BARRIERS AND CONSTRAINTS OF THE PANDEMIC. A NOVEL METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING TEAMS FOR CASE STUDY IS EMPLOYED BY IMPLEMENTING ADVANCED COMPUTING TECHNIQUES IN A NEW AND ROBUST BIBLIOMETRIC DATASET, COMPLEMENTED BY OTHER SNOWBALL SAMPLING TECHNIQUES.

OUR GOAL IS TO INSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS TO BRIDGE DIVERSE SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES TO GAIN A TRANSDISCIPLINARY UNDERSTANDING OF CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS. TO REACH THIS GOAL, WE WILL OFFER A SERIES OF THREE ADVANCED SCIENCE INSTITUTES (ASI) IN AUSTRALIA THAT WILL FOSTER THE COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING AND EMERGENT NEEDS OF THE CORAL REEF SCIENTIFIC AND CONSERVATION COMMUNITIES. WE WILL MODEL THESE GRADUATE-LEVEL COURSES AFTER APPROACHES DEVELOPED FOR EARTH SYSTEMS SCIENCE, WHICH COMBINE TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINES TO BUILD A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF EARTH AS A COMPLEX AND ADAPTIVE SYSTEM. BY INCORPORATING A TEAM OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS FROM VARIOUS DISCIPLINES IN CORAL REEF SCIENCE, THESE ASIS WILL HELP TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT SHORTAGE IN TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCHERS EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS FACING CORAL REEFS AND OTHER MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. TRAINING THROUGH THESE ASIS WILL ADDRESS SPECIFIC AND MEASURABLE SOCIETAL NEEDS BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF STEM EDUCATION FOR U.S.-BASED, MARINE SCIENCE GRADUATE STUDENTS, ULTIMATELY ENHANCING THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO INFORM PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. A KEY PRIORITY WILL BE TO RECRUIT U.S.-BASED GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS (WOMEN, PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, AND MINORITIES) TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND EQUITY IN STEM RESEARCH FIELDS. BY MEETING THESE GOALS, WE WILL INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF AMERICAN STEM EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET, FOSTER INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS IN RESEARCH AND EDUCATION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND AUSTRALIA, AND ENHANCE THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE IN STEM INDUSTRY, AGENCY, AND ACADEMIA. GIVEN THE UNPRECEDENTED PRESSURE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER ANTHROPOGENIC STRESSORS THAT CORAL REEFS AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT DEPEND ON THEM FACE, PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT AND NOVEL TECHNIQUES AT THE MARGINS OF TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO COUNTERACT THE DEGRADATION OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS. AS A RESPONSE TO THE SHORTAGE OF BROADLY TRAINED, TRANSDISCIPLINARY CORAL REEF SCIENTISTS, THESE ASI WORKSHOPS IN FAR-NORTH QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA WILL DEVELOP A SYSTEMS-BASED APPROACH TO TARGET STUDENT TRAINING IN A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES RELATED TO CORAL REEF SCIENCE AND CONSERVATION. STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH EXPERTS IN A RANGE OF FIELDS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ECOLOGY, BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, PHYSIOLOGY, ANIMAL BEHAVIOR, MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL SCIENCE. STUDENTS WILL FIRST LEARN ABOUT SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE AND ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS ON NATURAL SYSTEMS AT THE SCHOOL FOR FIELD STUDIES (SFS), CENTRE FOR RAINFOREST STUDIES (CRS) IN THE ATHERTON TABLELANDS (7 DAYS), THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE LAND AND OCEAN-BASED UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES MEET (DAINTREE RAINFOREST AND GREAT BARRIER REEF). THE GROUP WILL THEN TRAVEL TO THE LIZARD ISLAND RESEARCH STATION (LIRS), A STATE-OF-THE-ART, ISLAND-BASED RESEARCH FACILITY IN THE NORTHERN GREAT BARRIER REEF (14 DAYS), WHERE STUDENTS WILL LEARN FROM AND BE GUIDED THROUGH INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PROJECTS BY A DIVERSE GROUP OF AMERICAN AND AUSTRALIAN CORAL REEF SCIENTISTS.

SUBDUCTION ZONES, KNOWN FOR PARALLEL CHAINS OF TOWERING VOLCANOES AND DEEP OCEANIC TRENCHES, HOST EARTH'S MOST GEOLOGICALLY COMPLEX AND HEAVILY POPULATED REGIONS. SUBDUCTION ZONES REPRESENT THE CONTINUOUS CONVERGENCE OF TWO TECTONIC PLATES, ONE OF WHICH SUBDUCTS (?DIVES?) INTO THE MANTLE WHILE THE OTHER RIDES OVER THE TOP OF THE SUBDUCTING PLATE. STRESS IN THIS CONVERGING SYSTEM CONTINUOUSLY BUILDS UNTIL IT EXCEEDS THE FRICTIONAL STRENGTH OF THE BOUNDARY SEPARATING THE TWO PLATES. AT THIS POINT, THE PENT-UP STRESS IS RELEASED IN THE FORM OF AN EARTHQUAKE AND WARPS THE SEAFLOOR. THIS WARPING SEAFLOOR SHIFTS THE OVERLYING OCEAN SURFACE, A PROCESS KNOWN AS TSUNAMI GENESIS. ONLY SUBDUCTION ZONES CAN GENERATE MEGA-EARTHQUAKES, WHICH CAN WARP THE SEAFLOOR OVER TREMENDOUSLY VAST AREAS AND TRIGGER DEVASTATING TSUNAMIS. PREDICTING TSUNAMIS IS A CHALLENGING PROBLEM BECAUSE IT REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE INACCESSIBLE DETAILS OF THE STRESS RELEASE ALONG THE PLATE BOUNDARY AND HOW IT DEFORMS THE STRUCTURE OF THE ENTIRE SUBDUCTION ZONE. THIS RESEARCH PRESENTS A NEW APPROACH THAT BRINGS THE COMBINED POWER OF MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS TO BEAR ON THIS PROBLEM. MATHEMATICS DESCRIBES THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES OF EARTHQUAKES AND TSUNAMIS AND THE STATISTICS ACCOUNT FOR WHAT IS KNOWN, OR MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IS UNKNOWN ABOUT THE SUBDUCTION ZONE SYSTEM. RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH COULD PROVIDE THE TOOLS TO EVALUATE RISKS FOR COASTAL LOCATIONS THAT ARE PRONE TO TSUNAMIS. NUMERICAL MODELING IS THE KEY TO THIS APPROACH AND DEMAND FOR NUMERICAL MODELING SKILLS IS INCREASING IN PARALLEL WITH EXPANDING DATA COLLECTION INITIATIVES AND ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITIES. THIS PROJECT INCLUDES AN EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT THAT WILL ENGAGE STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS IN FORMALIZED TRAINING IN NUMERICAL MODELING. THIS RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP NUMERICAL TOOLS WITH A PROBABILISTIC PERSPECTIVE TO INVESTIGATE THE COUPLING OF SEAFLOOR DEFORMATION FROM MEGATHRUST EARTHQUAKES AND TSUNAMIS. THESE TOOLS WILL ADDRESS THE CHALLENGING PROBLEM OF EMBEDDING SOPHISTICATED FINITE ELEMENT MODELS OF EARTHQUAKE DEFORMATION INTO AUTOMATED MONTE CARLO SAMPLING STRATEGIES. THE DEFORMATION MODELS WILL HAVE GEODETICALLY-INFORMED SLIP DISTRIBUTIONS OVER CURVED FAULT SURFACES EMBEDDED IN DOMAINS HAVING THE GEOMETRIC IRREGULARITIES OF TOPOGRAPHY AND BATHYMETRY. DOMAINS WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY ACCOUNT FOR SEISMIC TOMOGRAPHY AND REFLECTION MODELS, SUBMARINE-BASED SEAFLOOR OBSERVATIONS, AND TSUNAMI OBSERVATIONS. THESE MODELS WILL PROPAGATE UNCERTAINTIES FROM GEODETIC DATA INTO PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS FOR TSUNAMI RUN-UP BEHAVIOR ALONG COASTAL LOCATIONS. THIS RESEARCH WILL, FOR THE FIRST TIME, QUANTIFY HOW THE LARGER UNCERTAINTIES FOR NEAR-TRENCH SLIP PROPAGATE INTO TSUNAMI PREDICTIONS. FINITE ELEMENT MODELS ARE NECESSARY TO SIMULATE THE COMPLEX MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF SUBDUCTION ZONES AND MONTE CARLO SAMPLING WILL REVEAL HOW UNCERTAINTIES IN THE DATA AND MODEL CONFIGURATIONS PROPAGATE INTO DEFORMATION AND TSUNAMI PREDICTIONS. THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED USING THE WELL-DOCUMENTED 2004 SUMATRA MEGATHRUST EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI AS A CASE STUDY.

PARTICULATE MATTER IN THE OPEN OCEAN CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF ORGANIC MATERIAL FROM PLANKTON AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL DETRITUS, WHICH CAN READILY AGGREGATE TO FORM LARGE FLOCS. A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES TRANSFORMS THESE FLOCS AS THEY SETTLE, REDISTRIBUTING MATERIAL THROUGHOUT THE WATER COLUMN AND POTENTIALLY SEQUESTERING ELEMENTS SUCH AS CARBON IN THE DEEP OCEAN. THE IMPACT OF THESE TRANSFORMATIONS IS AFFECTED BY THE SINKING SPEED OF THESE FLOCS, WITH LARGER AND DENSER PARTICLES SETTLING FASTER THAN SMALLER, LESS-DENSE ONES. ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS FACING OCEANOGRAPHERS TODAY IS WHAT CONTROLS PARTICLE SETTLING SPEED (FOR EXAMPLE, PARTICLE SIZE, SHAPE, AND DENSITY). THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE THAT PARTICLES READILY BREAK APART AS THEY SETTLE, DECREASING THEIR AVERAGE SIZE AND SETTLING SPEED, BUT IT IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD WHAT CONDITIONS CAUSE THESE DISAGGREGATION EVENTS. THIS WORK WILL MEASURE THE BREAKUP CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANIC SETTLING PARTICLES BOTH IN THE LABORATORY AND AT SEA TO QUANTIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE BREAKUP PROCESSES RELATIVE TO PARTICLE TRANSPORT.

POLYCRYSTALLINE STRONTIUM TITANATE AND MULTILAYERED STRONTIUM TITANATE /MAGNESIUM OXIDE CONTAINING A HIGH DENSITY OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES (GBS) AND PHASE BOUNDARIES (PBS) WILL BE CHOSEN AS THE MODEL MATERIALS. THE CAC SIMULATIONS WILL BRIDGE THE RELEVANT LENGTH SCALES THROUGH RESOLVING THE GBS AND PBS AT AN ATOMISTIC RESOLUTION WHILE THE DISLOCATIONS AWAY FROM THEM WILL BE DEALT IN A COARSE-GRAINED DESCRIPTION. THIS WILL ENABLE A PREDICTION OF THE MICROSCOPIC-LEVEL IONIC TRANSPORT IN STRAINED SOLID OXIDES WITHOUT SMEARING OUT THE ATOMISTIC NATURE OF ION HOPPING NEAR THE MATERIAL DEFECTS. DATA AND INSIGHTS REGARDING DIFFUSION UNDER STRESS, WHICH CONTROLS THE KINETICS OF PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS, OXIDATION, CREEP, AND MANY OTHER ENGINEERING PROCESSES IN SOLID MATERIALS, WILL BE GENERATED.

THIS IS MOST GLARING IN AI, WHERE OUR CAPACITY TO ENGINEER POWERFUL AI SYSTEMS HAS VASTLY OUTPACED OUR CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND THEM. BY BUILDING DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE MAJOR DISCIPLINES STUDYING NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCES, OUR PROJECT WILL PRODUCE A ROADMAP FOR ACCELERATING RESEARCH COLLABORATION ON ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL INTELLIGENCES (ARCANI). TO CREATE THIS ROADMAP, ARCANI WILL LINK SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH NETWORKS, DRAWING ON INSIGHTS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT CROSS DISCIPLINES, CAREER STAGES, AND COUNTRIES. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE RESEARCH NETWORKS WILL ALSO HELP DIVERSIFY PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCES. IT WILL TRAIN A COHORT OF EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS IN NEW WAYS OF DOING SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION.

EACH AREA WILL BE EXPLORED BY A CROSS-NETWORK WORKING GROUP, HOLDING SEVERAL VIRTUAL MEETINGS AND ONE IN-PERSON MEETING. EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS (ECRS, INCLUDING GRAD STUDENTS AND POSTDOCS) WILL PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE; THE DIVERSE INTELLIGENCES SUMMER INSTITUTE (DISI) WILL HELP RECRUIT DIVERSE AND EXCEPTIONALLY GIFTED ECRS. WORKING GROUPS WILL ADDRESS THREE QUESTIONS: WHAT ARE THE GAPS IN EXISTING KNOWLEDGE? WHO IN THEIR NETWORKS IS BEST POSITIONED TO COME TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THEM? HOW CAN ACCELNET SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS? THESE QUESTIONS WILL DRIVE SURVEYS OF EXISTING RESEARCH, DEFINITION OF KEY CONCEPTS, AND FRANK ASSESSMENT OF BARRIERS.

THE GOAL IS TO FILL THE KNOWLEDGE GAP IN CARBON MATERIALS, ACCELERATE NEW CARBON MATERIALS DISCOVERY, CREATE AND SHARE FABRICATION AND MANUFACTURING TOOLBOXES, EXPLORE FRONTIER CARBON DEVICE AND NEW APPLICATIONS, AND TRAIN HIGHLY DIVERSE RESEARCHERS AND TECHNICAL LEADERS WITH SKILLSETS TO CONDUCT COMPLEX PROJECTS REQUIRING INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION. THIS ACCELERATING RESEARCH THROUGH INTERNATIONAL NETWORK-TO-NETWORK COLLABORATIONS (ACCELNET) PROJECT WILL CONNECT 18 NETWORKS INCLUDING INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH NETWORKS, REGIONAL CLUSTERS AND USER FACILITIES ACROSS 10 COUNTRIES. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS N-O-N IS TO FILL IN THE KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN THE AREAS OF MODELING THE PYROLYSIS FROM POLYMER PRECURSOR TO FINAL CARBON MICROSTRUCTURE, TUNING CARBON SHAPES AND CARBON INTERFACES THROUGH SELF-ASSEMBLY AND CONTROLLABLE FUNCTIONALIZATION, HYBRID CARBON MATERIALS ENABLING HIGH PERFORMANCE ENERGY, SENSING, AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES, AND SCALABLE MANUFACTURING THROUGH THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL ROADMAP ON CARBON SYSTEMS (IRCS) AND BUILDING A GLOBAL DATABASE FOR BEST PRACTICES, SUSTAINABILITY, AND LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS.

THESE CHANGES CAN ALSO INTERACT WITH EXTREME WEATHER AND CLIMATE EVENTS, HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE HEALTH AND OPERATION OF MULTI-SECTORAL URBAN SYSTEMS. WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF SMART SENSOR SYSTEMS AND COMPUTATIONAL POWER, RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE STATE VARIABLES FOR URBAN CLIMATES AND SYSTEMS RESEARCH, WHICH HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS IN DECISION SUPPORT FOR URBAN METEOROLOGICAL HAZARDS. DESPITE THIS PROGRESS, THERE IS STILL A LACK OF AN URBAN ANALYTICS PLATFORM THAT PROVIDES COHERENT AND STANDARDIZED DATABASES FOR URBAN CLIMATES AND SYSTEMS AT APPROPRIATE SPATIOTEMPORAL SCALES. THIS LACK OF AN URBAN ANALYTICS PLATFORM IMPEDES THE GENERALIZATION OF URBAN CLIMATE RESEARCH RESULTS ACROSS GLOBAL CITIES AND HINDERS THE APPLICATION OF RESEARCH OUTCOMES TO MULTI-SECTORAL URBAN SYSTEMS.

SUBDUCTION ZONES PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE MULTIPLE HAZARDS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN LOCATIONS THAT GENERATE SOME OF THE LARGEST RISK FROM GEOLOGICAL EVENTS. IN ADDITION, THE GEOMETRY OF SUBDUCTION ZONES PERMITS UNUSUALLY WELL-CONTROLLED NATURAL EXPERIMENTS THAT CAN BE USED TO ISOLATE AND STUDY KEY FACTORS DRIVING GEOHAZARDS. THE STUDY OF SUBDUCTION ZONES IS INTRINSICALLY AN INTERNATIONAL ENTERPRISE BECAUSE: (1) COMPARISON ACROSS REGIONS ALLOWS FOR INSIGHTS ABOUT THE CONTROLLING FACTORS OF THE TECTONIC, VOLCANIC AND LANDSCAPE SYSTEMS. (2) LARGE GEOHAZARDS ARE INHERENTLY RARE EVENTS THAT REQUIRE A PORTFOLIO APPROACH GLOBALLY TO GUARANTEE THE CORRECT OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE SYSTEMATICALLY. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN SUBDUCTION ZONE GEOHAZARDS ARE NOW BEING MADE INTERNATIONALLY. ACTIVE NETWORKS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA, OCEANIA AND ASIA ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING COMPLEMENTARY SCIENCE AGENDAS AND BUILDING LARGE-SCALE DEPLOYMENTS. COORDINATION BETWEEN ACTIVITIES IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE MAXIMUM SCIENCE IS OBTAINED FROM THESE EFFORTS. SZNET WOULD COMBINE 14 NETWORKS ACROSS 5 CONTINENTS WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON IMPROVING OBSERVATIONS IN CHILE, WHICH HOSTS ONE OF THE WORLD?S MOST GEOLOGICALLY ACTIVE AND ACCESSIBLE SUBDUCTION ZONES. MULTIPLE PROJECTS ON AND OFFSHORE ARE WORKING TO ESTABLISH THE LARGE-SCALE DATA COLLECTION AND RESEARCH EFFORT REQUIRED TO STUDY THIS EXEMPLARY SYSTEM AND COORDINATION IS NEEDED TO OPTIMIZE THE SCIENTIFIC OUTPUT BOTH HERE AND GLOBALLY. THE GOAL OF SZNET IS TO DEVELOP AN INTELLECTUAL COMMUNITY WITH THREE MISSIONS: 1. TO COMPARE OBSERVATIONS OF SUBDUCTION ZONES AROUND THE GLOBE WITH A COMMON DATASET AND UNDERSTANDING, 2. TO COOPERATE TO CONSISTENTLY INSTRUMENT CRITICAL SUBDUCTION ZONES THAT CAN PROVIDE KEY AND TRANSFERRABLE INSIGHTS, AND 3. TO DEVELOP AND NURTURE AN INTERNATIONAL AND DIVERSE CADRE OF EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS THAT IS EQUIPPED TO MAKE THE NECESSARY BREAKTHROUGHS. THESE MISSIONS WILL BE SUPPORTED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF WORKSHOPS, WEBINARS, DATA EXCHANGES, FIELD SCHOOLS, PILOT PROJECTS AND STUDENT EXCHANGES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THESE ACTIVITIES WILL ALLOW A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO OBSERVATIONS TO ENABLE GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE THAT WILL BOTH CREATE THE NECESSARY BASELINE DATA AND MAXIMIZE THE CHANCES OF CAPTURING EARTHQUAKES, VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND LANDSLIDES. IN ADDITION, THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS WILL BENEFIT PARTNER NETWORKS WHILE STIMULATING COORDINATED DEPLOYMENT AND RESEARCH STRATEGIES. UNDERSTANDING GEOHAZARDS HAS DIRECT SOCIETAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC RIM AND OTHER SUBDUCTION ZONES AROUND THE WORLD. THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CONTROLS ON WHEN AND WHERE IMPACTFUL EARTHQUAKES, ERUPTIONS AND LANDSLIDES CAN HAPPEN IS A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO FOCUSSING RESOURCES AND MITIGATION EFFORTS. DEVELOPING THIS UNDERSTANDING THROUGH AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORK WOULD CONNECT THE DISPARATE EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE OF EXPERTS IN EACH SUBDUCTION ZONE TO PROVIDE A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK THROUGH MISSIONS 1 AND 2.

MOST RESEARCH ON WASTE MANAGEMENT HAS FOCUSED ON LARGE, WEALTHY EUROPEAN AND US SYSTEMS. THOSE APPROACHES ARE NOT APPLICABLE FOR THE MANY SMALL ISLAND NATIONS OF THE CARIBBEAN AS THE SMALL ISLAND NATIONS OF THE CARIBBEAN IMPORT COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF GOODS, INCLUDING PLASTICS, BUT HAVE LIMITED MEANS OR SPACE FOR RECYCLING AND RECOVERY. A CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR PLASTICS COULD REDUCE GLOBAL GHG EMISSIONS AND FUEL A MORE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY IN THE CARIBBEAN. THIS PROJECT ESTABLISHES AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF CARIBBEAN AND US COLLABORATORS THAT WILL CONNECT THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE PLASTIC ECOSYSTEM TO DESIGN SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS TO THE PLASTIC ECONOMY OF THE CARIBBEAN. WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH BIOGALS, A NONPROFIT EMPOWERING WOMEN OF COLOR TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS FOR COMMUNITIES, TO SUPPORT BROADENING PARTICIPATION IN OUR PROJECT. THE TEAM WILL IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACTS OF MICROPLASTICS, RECOVER THE RESOURCES LOST WHEN PLASTICS ARE MISMANAGED, DEVELOP SOLUTIONS BASED ON LOCAL NEEDS WITH LOCAL RESEARCHERS, AND IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCALE OF PLASTIC WASTES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE TEAM WILL USE A STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS TO DEVELOP A PLASTICS NETWORK STRATEGIC PLAN AND RESEARCH ROADMAP THAT AT ITS CORE ENSURES SUSTAINABILITY AND SUPPORTS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. THE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE A WORKSHOP AND A NETWORK EVENT THAT IS PART SYMPOSIUM AND PART DESIGN CHARRETTE.

GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OF BIODIVERSITY ARE EXPECTED TO BE INFLUENCED BY A COMBINATION OF LOCAL BIOLOGICAL FACTORS, LIKE COMPETITION AMONG SPECIES, AND BY REGIONAL TO CONTINENTAL PHYSICAL FACTORS, SUCH AS CLIMATE. HOWEVER, THIS EXPECTATION HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED FROM LOCAL TO CONTINENTAL SCALES ACROSS DIVERSE SPECIES LINEAGES. IN ADDITION, NATURAL AND HUMAN-MADE DISTURBANCES ARE LIKELY TO ALTER THIS EXPECTATION. THIS STUDY USES THE GEOGRAPHIC DESIGN OF THE NATIONAL ECOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY NETWORK (NEON) ACROSS THE USA TO TEST THIS IDEA, BY QUANTIFYING MULTIPLE BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL FACTORS AFFECTING BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF SMALL MAMMALS, FISH, AND GROUND BEETLES AT NESTED SPATIAL SCALES. THE STUDY WILL ADD NEW, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA TO NEON INCLUDING MEASURES OF ANIMAL BODY SIZES, SPECIES DIVERSITY, AND GEOSPATIAL LAYERS FOR DISTURBANCE AND LAND USE HISTORIES, CLIMATE, GEOLOGY, AND TOPOGRAPHY. TEACHING MODULES WILL HIGHLIGHT DATA SCIENCE SKILLS NEEDED TO WORK WITH NEON DATA. UNDERGRADUATES, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND POSTDOCS WILL ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH THE RESEARCH. THE STUDY WILL ALSO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC AND INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE BIOSPHERE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE WITH AN INTERACTIVE EXHIBIT FOR SCIENCE ON A SPHERE DEVELOPED WITH COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS, A NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, AND A LARGE SCIENCE FESTIVAL.

THIS RESEARCH DEVELOPS A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK THAT DESCRIBES RELATIONSHIPS AMONG INTRASPECIFIC TRAIT VARIATION (ITV) IN BODY SIZE, BIODIVERSITY, AND DRIVERS RELATED TO DISTURBANCE, PAST LAND USE, AND THEIR INTERACTIONS. THIS FRAMEWORK WILL ADVANCE BASIC THEORY AND PREDICTION OF SPATIAL BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS BY LINKING ITV TO DRIVERS OF BIODIVERSITY ACROSS SCALES. THREE MAIN QUESTIONS INCLUDE: (1) HOW DOES SPATIAL SCALE INFLUENCE BODY SIZE ITV AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH BIODIVERSITY ACROSS TAXA WITHIN NEON? (2) HOW IS DISTURBANCE REGIME EXPLAINED BY DIFFERENT SCALES OF CLIMATE, GEODIVERSITY AND LAND COVER, AND PAST LAND USE ACROSS NEON? (3) HOW DO RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CLIMATE, GEODIVERSITY AND LAND COVER, PAST LAND USE, DISTURBANCE REGIME, AND BODY SIZE ITV EXPLAIN VARIATION IN BIODIVERSITY ACROSS TAXA FROM LOCAL TO CONTINENTAL SCALES? THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL MEET A MAJOR RESEARCH NEED WITHIN NEON, TO QUANTIFY DISTURBANCE AND LAND USE HISTORY DATA FROM THE PLOT TO THE DOMAIN SCALE. SUCH DATA ARE ESSENTIAL TO INTERPRETATION OF OBSERVATIONAL ECOLOGICAL DATA AND WILL BE PUBLICLY DISSEMINATED AS A GEOSPATIAL AND TABULAR DATABASE CONTAINING CODE FOR LINKING OTHER NEON PLOT, SITE, AND DOMAIN DATA PRODUCTS.

UC DAVIS AND IHE DELFT WILL JOIN FORCES TO BRING THREE COHORTS OF US ADVANCED GRADUATE STUDENTS TO EUROPE AND PROVIDE THEM IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES IN CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF DIFFERING INTERNATIONAL APPROACHES TO WATER SCIENCE, POLICY, AND MANAGEMENT. YEAR 1: INTERNATIONAL APPROACHES TO FLOOD-RISK MANAGEMENT, YEAR 2: DROUGHT AND GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT, AND YEAR 3: FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS IN A CLIMATE OF GROWING EXTREMES.

OVERALL, THIS PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO US EXPERTISE IN SOLVING FUTURE WATER-RELATED CHALLENGES DOMESTICALLY AND WORLDWIDE. THE PROJECT HAS THREE THEMES. 1. INTERNATIONAL APPROACHES TO FLOOD-RISK MANAGEMENT: FLOOD MAGNITUDES, FREQUENCIES, AND IMPACTS ARE BECOMING MORE SEVERE IN MOST AREAS AS A WARMING CLIMATE INCREASES ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATION AND STORM INTENSITY. THE FIELD OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT INTEGRATES FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT AND ITS REDUCTION TO A TOLERABLE LEVEL USING DIVERSE TECHNICAL AND SOCIAL MEASURES, LEADING TO INCREASED RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION CAPACITY. INTEGRATED FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT AIMS TO REDUCE THE HUMAN AND SOCIOECONOMIC LOSSES CAUSED BY FLOODING WHILE AT THE SAME TIME TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE BENEFITS FROM FLOODS AND THE USE OF FLOOD PLAINS OR COASTAL ZONES. 2. INTERNATIONAL APPROACHES TO DROUGHT AND GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT: GROUNDWATER RESOURCES HAVE LONG BEEN USED FOR DOMESTIC, IRRIGATION, AND INDUSTRIAL WATER SUPPLIES WHERE ACCESS TO SURFACE WATER IS LACKING, EITHER SEASONALLY, LONG-TERM, OR DUE TO UNUSUAL CLIMATE EVENTS LEADING TO RELATIVE LACK OF PRECIPITATION AND RUNOFF (DROUGHT). DWINDLING GROUNDWATER RESOURCES NOT ONLY THREATEN LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLIES, THEY ALSO CAUSE EXPENSIVE AND SOMETIMES UNAFFORDABLE INCREASES IN PUMPING COSTS, WELL OUTAGES, LAND SUBSIDENCE, SEAWATER INTRUSION, AND WATER QUALITY DEGRADATION, AMONG OTHERS. CLIMATE CHANGE LEADS TO CHANGING PATTERNS AND INTENSITY OF DROUGHT, OF GROUNDWATER RECHARGE, AND OF WATER DEMANDS ON GROUNDWATER RESERVOIRS. 3. FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS IN A CLIMATE OF GROWING EXTREMES: WATERSHEDS AND RIVER ENVIRONMENTS ARE COMPLEX ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS WHERE GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES INTERACT WITH HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES TO SUPPORT ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AND ASSOCIATED AQUATIC AND RIPARIAN HABITATS. AS THE CHIEF SOURCE OF RENEWABLE WATER SUPPLY FOR FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETAL USE, RIVERS AND WETLANDS PROVIDE VITAL SUPPORTING, PROVISIONING, REGULATING, AND CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. RIPARIAN ZONES ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 75% OF TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS IN THE WESTERN U.S. THE GLOBAL EXTENT AND SEVERITY OF ECOSYSTEM DECLINE HAS STIMULATED A WORLDWIDE RESPONSE IN THE FORMATION OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL SCIENCE-POLICY PLATFORM ON BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (IPBES) AND LAUNCH OF THE UN DECADE ON RESTORATION (2021-2030). LIKE ECOSYSTEMS THEMSELVES, ADDRESSING THE THREATS REQUIRES SCIENTISTS CAPABLE OF WORKING ACROSS DISCIPLINES, TECHNOLOGIES, AND LANDSCAPES. TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER SYSTEMS, STUDENTS MUST UNDERSTAND THEIR INTERDISCIPLINARY AND INTEGRATIVE NATURE, ULTIMATELY LEARNING TO THINK SYNERGISTICALLY ABOUT BIOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND ANTHROPOGENIC INTERACTIONS.

TRANSPORTATION, URBAN LOGISTICS, FACTORY AUTOMATION, SMART FARMING/AGRICULTURE AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT, TO NAME A FEW. AVS AND CAVS HAVE STRONG POTENTIAL TO INCREASE PERFORMANCE, SAFETY, AND EFFICIENCY, AND AS A RESULT, TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETAL WELL-BEING AND ENHANCE ECONOMIC GROWTH. ON THE OTHER HAND, AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS STILL FAIL TO PROVIDE GENERALIZABLE RESPONSES TO VEHICLE, SENSOR, ROAD, AND ENVIRONMENT RELATED UNCERTAINTIES, AND NEED HUMAN INTERVENTION. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL), AN EMERGING BRANCH OF MACHINE LEARNING (ML) AND CONTROL, HAS A LOT TO PROMISE FOR AUTONOMY WITH ITS CAPACITY TO ADDRESS UNPREDICTABLE CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM AND ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER, THE FIELD STILL HAS MANY RESEARCH GAPS AND ALSO SUFFERS FROM THE LACK OF PRACTICAL RESEARCH EVALUATION. MOST AI BASED AV RESEARCH IS PERFORMED IN SIMULATIONS, ON SIMPLE PLATFORMS AND FOR SIMPLIFIED CASES THAT ARE FAR FROM REFLECTING REAL-LIFE UNCERTAINTIES AND CONVINCING RESPONSES TO CHANGING ROAD CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY AT HIGH SPEEDS. THIS 3-YEAR PROJECT WILL SUPPORT SELECTED UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM US UNIVERSITIES TO TACKLE THE OPEN CHALLENGES OF FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WITHIN A COHORT EXPERIENCE AT ISTANBUL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY (ITU) UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERTS FROM ITU, FROM KTH, AND A US BASED AUTONOMOUS BUS COMPANY (ADASTEC CORP).

THE ALGORITHM TESTS WILL BE PERFORMED AROUND THE ITU CAMPUS WITHIN REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS. EACH YEAR, A DIFFERENT STUDENT COHORT WILL BE SELECTED FOR THIS UNIQUE RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO THE US LEADERSHIP IN THE FUTURE OF VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES WITH A WELL-PREPARED WORKFORCE. SPECIAL RECRUITMENT EFFORTS ARE PLANNED FOR BROADENING PARTICIPATION AND RECRUITMENT OF STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. THE ADAPTIVE OPTIMALITY OFFERED BY RL PROVIDES INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY WHEN COMPARED WITH CLASSICAL CONTROL APPROACHES THAT CANNOT HANDLE UNSTRUCTURED DYNAMICS, OFTEN RESULTING IN SAFE BUT HIGHLY CONSERVATIVE, LOW-PERFORMANCE SOLUTIONS. SIMILARLY, BECAUSE OF ITS ADAPTABILITY TO CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROBLEM DYNAMICS, RL OFFERS INCREASED SAFETY WHEN COMPARED WITH RULE-BASED, HEURISTIC APPROACHES OFTEN PRACTICED IN INDUSTRIES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND PLATFORMS. THE STUDENT RESEARCH PROJECTS FOR EACH LAYER OF VEHICLE AUTONOMY WILL USE RL BASED DESIGNS TO ADDRESS UNCERTAINTIES AND DISTURBANCES FACED IN REAL-LIFE, WHICH HAVE OFTEN BEEN IGNORED IN LAB BASED AV RESEARCH. IN OUR PERCEPTION/LOCALIZATION PROJECTS, NOVEL ALGORITHMS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE SENSING UNCERTAINTIES TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF RL BASED MOTION PLANNING AND DYNAMIC OBJECT TRACKING. THE TRAJECTORY TRACKING ALGORITHMS WILL BE BASED ON ZERO-SUM GAMES (ZSG) AND ONLINE, MODEL-FREE RL BASED CONTROL ALGORITHMS TO ADDRESS DISTURBANCES AND SLIP/SLIDE EFFECTS, WHICH IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION.

PARTICIPATING STUDENTS WILL BE RECRUITED WITH AN EMPHASIS ON UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA-LINCOLN (UNL) AND LOCAL UNIVERSITIES IN NEBRASKA INCLUDING NATIVE INDIAN TRIBAL COLLEGES. AS PRE-DEPARTURE PREPARATION TRAININGS, STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN A SCIENCE COMMUNICATION WORKSHOP FOCUSED ON TECHNICAL WRITING, VIRTUAL MEETINGS WITH TUT MENTORS ON RESEARCH ACTIVITIES, AND CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE LESSONS. PARTICIPATING STUDENTS WILL NOT ONLY RECEIVE HIGH-QUALITY PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND EXPOSURE TO WORLD-CLASS RESEARCHERS AND STATE-OF-THE-ART RESEARCH FACILITIES, BUT ALSO EXPERIENCE A MULTICULTURAL AND INTERDISCIPLINARY ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION TO RESEARCH ACTIVITIES, PARTICIPATING STUDENTS WILL VISIT JAPANESE WORLD-LEADING COMPANIES SUCH AS TOYOTA AND YAMAHA. THIS PROJECT SERVES THE NATIONAL INTEREST BY (1) PROMOTING THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE IN PATHOGEN DETECTION AND POCT TECHNOLOGY, (2) ADVANCING THE NATIONAL HEALTH AND SECURING THE NATIONAL DEFENSE BY DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE AND EFFICIENT POCT DEVICES FOR PATHOGEN DETECTION, AND (3) ENGAGING U.S. STUDENTS IN INTERDISCIPLINARY AND MULTICULTURAL RESEARCH AND THUS INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEIR CHOICE OF STEM CAREER. IN THE WAKE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF QUICK AND ACCURATE DETECTION OF CORONAVIRUS CANNOT BE OVEREMPHASIZED. ALTHOUGH CONVENTIONAL DETECTION METHODS CAN PROVIDE RELIABLE AND ACCURATE RESULTS, THERE HAS BEEN A PRESSING NEED FOR A COMPACT, AFFORDABLE, AND EASY-TO-USE TOOL THAT CAN RAPIDLY DETECT CORONAVIRUS AS WELL AS OTHER INFECTIOUS PATHOGENS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF SENSITIVITY AND RELIABILITY AT THE POINT OF CARE. POCT DEVICES CAN BE A SOLUTION FOR THIS URGENT SOCIETAL NEED, AND THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP POCT DEVICES BY INTEGRATING A CMOS OPTICAL SENSOR AND MICROCHANNEL DEVICES. INTEGRATING MICROCHANNELS FOR LIQUID SAMPLE PUMPING AND GUIDANCE WITH A CMOS SENSOR IN A PORTABLE CASE WITH OTHER ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS POSES VARIOUS RESEARCH CHALLENGES. IN OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES IN AN INTEGRATED DESIGN APPROACH, THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTION: HOW CAN THE MICROFLUIDIC AND CMOS COMPONENTS BE OPTIMIZED SEPARATELY AND INTEGRATED INTO A PORTABLE DEVICE? PARTICIPATING STUDENTS WILL RESEARCH KEY PARTS OF A PORTABLE POCT DEVICE SEPARATELY BASED ON RESPECTIVE RESEARCH EXPERTISE OF MENTORS, AND THEN THEY WILL INTEGRATE THEIR SOLUTIONS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL OF THE DEVICE.

THE GOAL OF THESE EXPERIMENTS IS TO INVESTIGATE THE PHYSICAL MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONVERSION OF ANTIMATTER INTO MATTER IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE. THIS IS ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS IN PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS AND COSMOLOGY, BECAUSE THE BIG BANG THEORY REQUIRES MATTER AND ANTIMATTER TO HAVE BEEN CREATED IN EQUAL PARTS, ALTHOUGH NOW, WE DO NOT OBSERVE SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF ANTIMATTER IN THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE. FIVE COLLABORATING INSTITUTIONS: UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY, BEREA COLLEGE, EASTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY, AND WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY WILL RECRUIT PARTICIPANTS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE INSTITUTIONS TO WORK TOGETHER AS A STUDENT TEAM/COHORT. THREE OF THE INSTITUTIONS OPERATE NUCLEAR PHYSICS ACCELERATOR FACILITIES WITH NEUTRON SOURCES FOR STUDENT TRAINING, AND THE OTHER TWO POSSESS OUTSTANDING UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS PROGRAMS THAT DRAW UNDERGRADUATES FROM APPALACHIA. AN INNOVATIVE ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RECRUITED DURING THE SUMMER PRIOR TO THE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND WILL RECEIVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING WITH THEIR ADVISOR AT THEIR HOME INSTITUTION BEFORE TRAVELLING TO JAPAN. THIS PERSONALIZED ACADEMIC YEAR-LONG TRAINING WILL PREPARE THE STUDENTS TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS IN A HIGHLY TECHNICAL FIELD AND GIVE THEM EXTRA TIME TO STUDY THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. THE PROGRAM WILL DIRECTLY TRAIN A NEW GENERATION OF TALENTED PHYSICISTS SKILLED AT WORKING IN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS AND CONDUCTING TEAM-BASED SCIENCE. THE SMALL SCALE OF THE NOPTREX EXPERIMENT AND ITS USE OF TECHNIQUES FROM MANY SUBFIELDS OF PHYSICS LENDS ITSELF TO HANDS-ON STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES AND EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES. SPECIAL CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO WOMEN, APPALACHIAN, FIRST-GENERATION, AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. STUDENTS CHOSEN FOR THE PROGRAM WILL ENJOY A RICH INTELLECTUAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE USING THE MOST ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND WILL GAIN WORLD-CLASS SKILLS IN PRECISION MEASUREMENTS WITH LOW-ENERGY NEUTRONS IN AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE SETTING. AS A RESULT, THE PROGRAM WILL STRENGTHEN INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURAL TIES BETWEEN THE NUCLEAR SCIENCE PROGRAMS OF THE US AND JAPAN BOTH FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND IN THE RISING GENERATION OF NUCLEAR PHYSICISTS. THE SCIENTIFIC GOAL OF THE NOPTREX COLLABORATION IS TO CONDUCT A NEW TYPE OF SENSITIVE SEARCH FOR TIME REVERSAL SYMMETRY VIOLATION IN POLARIZED NEUTRON TRANSMISSION THROUGH POLARIZED NUCLEI. THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW SOURCE OF TIME REVERSAL VIOLATION IN NEUTRON-NUCLEUS INTERACTIONS WOULD UNCOVER NEW PHYSICS BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS AND COULD ELUCIDATE THE ORIGIN OF THE BARYON ASYMMETRY OF THE UNIVERSE. THIS EXPERIMENT EXPLOITS SPECIAL PROPERTIES OF LOW ENERGY NEUTRON-NUCLEUS RESONANCES, WHICH CAN ACT AS A NATURAL AMPLIFIER OF PARITY AND TIME REVERSAL VIOLATION. THE DESIGN OF THE EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS DIRECTLY EMBODIES AND EXPLOITS THE PRINCIPLE OF MOTION-REVERSAL SYMMETRY TO CONDUCT A SENSITIVE SEARCH. THE JAPANESE SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE (JSNS) AT THE JAPAN PROTON ACCELERATOR RESEARCH COMPLEX (J-PARC) IS WELL-SUITED TO HOST THIS EXPERIMENT AND WILL BE AN IDEAL BACKDROP FOR AN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR OUR STUDENTS. SEVERAL MEASUREMENTS TOWARD THE NOPTREX GOALS HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED BOTH AT J-PARC AND LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY (LANL). AN INNOVATIVE ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE EXTENSIVE INDIVIDUALIZED, ACADEMIC-YEAR TRAINING FOR EACH STUDENT PRIOR TO CONDUCTING NUCLEAR PHYSICS RESEARCH IN JAPAN. IT BUILDS ON THE HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT CENTERED AROUND BOTH THE US MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL TEAM-BASED R&D EXPERIMENTS AT LANL AND THE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE EXPERIMENTS BEING PERFORMED AT J-PARC. EACH US INSTITUTION CONTRIBUTES SPECIALIZED HARDWARE EXPERTISE AND WILL PROVIDE PERSONALIZED TRAINING TO IRES PARTICIPANTS DURING THE FULL ACADEMIC YEAR TO PREPARE THEM FOR SPECIFIC TASKS DURING THEIR RESEARCH IN JAPAN. PARTICIPANTS WILL LEARN COLLABORATIVE SKILLS AND BOND AS THEY SHARE THEIR PROGRESS WITH EACH OTHER AND THEIR JAPANESE MENTORS IN WEEKLY COLLABORATION VIDEO CONFERENCE MEETINGS DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR. COHORT BUILDING, SCIENTIFIC TRAINING, AND CULTURAL AWARENESS WILL BE CONSOLIDATED DURING TWO IN-PERSON COLLABORATION/TRAINING MEETINGS BEFORE TRAVEL TO JAPAN. THE STUDENTS WILL PERFORM 10 WEEKS OF SUMMER RESEARCH AT NAGOYA UNIVERSITY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PROFESSORS HIROHIKO SHIMIZU, MASAAKI KITAGUCHI, AND TAKUYA OKUDAIRA, WITH THE AID OF ONE US GRADUATE PARTICIPANT. STUDENT RESEARCH WILL BE INTEGRATED IN THEIR FUNDAMENTAL NEUTRON PHYSICS RESEARCH GROUP, WHICH IS THE LARGEST IN JAPAN. STUDENTS WILL TEST EXPERIMENTAL HARDWARE USING THE LOW ENERGY NEUTRON TEST FACILITY AT NAGOYA UNIVERSITY. THEY WILL TAKE A SHORT TRIP TO J-PARC AND ANALYZE DATA COLLECTED ON THE ANNRI BEAMLINE AT J-PARC.

ROUTINELY, GROUNDWATER WELLS END UP TOO CLOSE TO TOILET FACILITIES, HEIGHTENING THE RISK OF GROUNDWATER CROSS-CONTAMINATION. THE RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH FROM THIS DUAL THREAT ARE NOT IN DOUBT. HOWEVER, CONTAMINANT MIGRATION PATHWAYS IN SUBSOIL MEDIA, AS WELL AS THE FACTORS THAT DRIVE CONTAMINATION, ARE OFTEN COMPLEX AND SITE-SPECIFIC. HENCE, A LITANY OF PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, AND PHYSIOGRAPHIC FACTORS, MUST BE WELL UNDERSTOOD TO CONCEPTUALIZE AND ADVANCE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS. RELATEDLY, THE NEED FOR A TRAINED, GLOBALLY COMPETENT SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WHO CAN ADDRESS CURRENT AND FUTURE WATER CHALLENGES HAS NEVER BEEN GREATER. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS BOTH NEEDS BY; (1) UNDERTAKING HIGH-IMPACT WATER QUALITY RESEARCH TO BROADLY ASSESS IMPACTS OF SALTWATER INTRUSION AND ON-SITE SANITATION FACILITIES ON COASTAL GROUNDWATER QUALITY IN CAPE COAST, GHANA, A LOCATION THAT TYPIFIES THE DUAL CHALLENGE, AND 2) STRENGTHEN THE PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION OF US STUDENTS AS FUTURE, GLOBALLY ENGAGED WATER RESOURCES SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. FACULTY AT SHIPPENSBURG UNIVERSITY (SU) AND UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA (USF) WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE COAST (UCC), IN GHANA, TO BRING THREE COHORTS OF US STUDENTS (GRAD AND UNDERGRAD) TO GHANA AND ENGAGE THEM IN TRANSFORMATIONAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES VIA RESEARCH IN WATER QUALITY, SANITATION, AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS PROJECT WILL STRATEGICALLY RECRUIT UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY GROUPS, INCLUDING FEMALES, AS AN INCENTIVE TO BROADEN THEIR PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL STEM RESEARCH AND ENHANCE THEIR STANDING IN STEM DISCIPLINES. THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THREE MAJOR THEMES: 1. EFFECTS OF ONSITE SANITATION ON GROUNDWATER QUALITY: TO EXPLORE THE VULNERABILITY OF SHALLOW GROUNDWATER TO ONSITE SANITATION, STUDENT PARTICIPANTS WILL CONDUCT BOTH FIELD EVALUATIONS AND LABORATORY ANALYSES OF GROUNDWATER SAMPLES FOR SPECIFIC CHEMICAL AND MICROBIAL CONTAMINANTS. THEY WILL EVALUATE EXISTING SANITATION INFRASTRUCTURE (E.G., SIZE OF SEPTIC SYSTEM & NUMBER OF USERS PER HOUSEHOLD), CALCULATE SEPTIC SYSTEM DENSITIES, COLLECT GPS COORDINATES OF WELLS AND SEPTIC SYSTEMS, PERFORM SOIL TESTS, AND ASSESS OTHER PERTINENT FACTORS TO HELP CHARACTERIZE AND ATTRIBUTE SOURCES OF VULNERABILITY. 2. EFFECTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE ON GROUNDWATER QUALITY: ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE OF SALTWATER INTRUSION INTO WELLS HAS BEEN REPORTED FOR SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES CLOSEST TO THE COASTLINE, IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW FAR INLAND THE SALTWATER HAS ENCROACHED. THE US STUDENTS WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEIR UCC PARTNERS, TO DETERMINE THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF SALTWATER INTRUSION IN THE AREA. THEY WILL CONDUCT IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS OF WELLS FOR SALINITY/CONDUCTIVITY/TDS, TEST WATER SAMPLES IN THE LABORATORY, AND PERFORM SPATIAL STATISTICAL ANALYSES ON THEIR RESULTS. 3. EDUCATION: AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS PROJECT IS A PROPOSED ANNUAL WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE (WASH) FAIR. THE DIFFERENT COHORTS OF US STUDENTS WILL COLLABORATE WITH THEIR LOCAL PARTNERS, MENTORS, AND LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL (HS) STUDENTS (AND THEIR TEACHERS) TO IMPLEMENT A WASH FAIR, WHICH WILL BECOME AN ANNUAL EVENT PROVIDING WASH ADVISORY SERVICES TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES BEYOND THE LIFE OF THIS PROJECT. THE PROJECT ALSO HAS ANOTHER OUTREACH COMPONENT WHERE THE US STUDENTS WILL ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR KNOWLEDGE SHARING. THEY WILL COLLABORATE WITH GHANAIAN HS TEACHERS TO DEVELOP A LOCAL PROGRAM FOR HS STUDENTS TO CONTINUE ROUTINE WELL WATER MONITORING INTO THE FUTURE. OVERALL, THE PROJECT WILL GIVE US STUDENTS FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCES WITH THE CRITICAL WATER QUALITY CONDITIONS IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY CONTEXT, AND ENHANCE THEIR INTERDISCIPLINARY, PROBLEM-SOLVING, AND COLLABORATIVE SKILLS. THROUGH THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH LOCAL RESEARCHERS AND COMMUNITIES, THE US STUDENTS WILL FURTHER GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOCIAL-CULTURAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT COMPLICATE WATER QUALITY CHALLENGES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND HOW TO PROPOSE SOLUTIONS FROM A GLOBAL CONTEXT.

IT HAS A VARIETY OF IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING DISASTER MANAGEMENT, SUPPLY CHAIN DESIGN, HEALTH CARE, AND HARVEST PLANNING. MOST REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS ARE COMPLICATED ENOUGH TO GENERATE A VERY LARGE-SIZE SP MODEL, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO SOLVE. QUICKLY FINDING THE OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS OF THESE MODELS IS CRITICAL FOR DECISION-MAKING WHEN FACING UNCERTAINTIES. EXISTING OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS HAVE A LIMITED CAPABILITY OF SOLVING LARGE-SCALE SP PROBLEMS. WITHOUT BEING EXPLICITLY PROGRAMMED, MACHINE LEARNING CAN GIVE COMPUTERS THE ABILITY TO LEARN WITH DATA BY USING STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE A MACHINE LEARNING-BASED COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK TO SOLVE LARGE-SCALE STOCHASTIC PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY BY INTEGRATING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES INTO OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS. THE PROJECT WILL BROADEN THE SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY OF MACHINE LEARNING IN OPERATIONS RESEARCH. FURTHERMORE, THIS RESEARCH WILL SUPPORT THE CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TRAINING OF GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CURRICULA IN THE INTERFACE OF MACHINE LEARNING AND OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS. THE PROJECT WILL BE THE PIONEERING STUDY OF APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING INTO STOCHASTIC PROGRAMMING, WHILE EXISTING WORKS USUALLY FOCUS ON USING STOCHASTIC PROGRAMMING TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS. MOTIVATED BY THE CHALLENGES FROM PRACTICES AND LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS, TWO RESEARCH OBJECTIVES ARE PROPOSED: EFFICIENT SAMPLE GENERATION AND CONVERGENCE ACCELERATION, BY TAKING SAMPLE AVERAGE APPROXIMATION AND L-SHAPED ALGORITHM AS EXAMPLES. THE FIRST RESEARCH OBJECTIVE IS TO DESIGN A SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM BASED ON SOLUTION INFORMATION TO EFFICIENTLY GENERATE SAMPLES FOR SAMPLE AVERAGE APPROXIMATION.

EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS CAN HAVE LIFE THREATENING CONSEQUENCES FOR ELDER POPULATIONS THAT ARE OFTEN MORE LIMITED IN MOBILITY AND HENCE MORE LIKELY TO STAY IN AND AROUND THEIR RESIDENCES. THESE THREATS CAN POTENTIALLY BE COMPOUNDED BY HOUSING TYPE AND STRUCTURE, NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND AMENITIES, ESPECIALLY WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES SUCH AS POWER OUTAGES. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE BUILT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT ON THE VULNERABLE POPULATION SUCH AS THE OLDER ADULT DURING DISASTERS HAS NOT BEEN EXAMINED CLOSELY.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO PIN DOWN THE NATURE OF THIS COMPLEXITY BY INVESTIGATING A SERIES OF FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS. FIRST, ARE THE INTERACTIONS THEMSELVES SIMPLE ENOUGH THAT THEIR PRECISE KNOWLEDGE CAN BE GAINED BY A PRACTICAL ALGORITHM? SUCH AN ALGORITHM IS ALSO EXPECTED TO BENEFIT QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES, FACILITATING LEARNING AND TESTING OF QUANTUM DEVICES. SECOND, HOW COMPUTATIONALLY DIFFICULT IS IT TO ESTIMATE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE QUANTUM PARTICLES, EVEN IF THE KNOWLEDGE OF INTERACTIONS IS AVAILABLE? THIS QUESTION WILL HELP UNDERSTAND THE LIMITS OF NEAR TERM QUANTUM DEVICES IN PROBING QUANTUM PARTICLES. THIRD, COULD THE COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF PARTICLES BE SIMPLE RATHER THAN COMPLEX, UNDER SOME COMMON ASSUMPTIONS ON THE INTERACTIONS? THIS WOULD ALLOW EFFICIENT MEANS TO COMPUTATIONALLY SIMULATE SYSTEMS THAT RESPECT THE ASSUMPTIONS.

DOES LIMITED ENTANGLEMENT HOLD FOR THE GROUND STATES OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL GAPPED LOCAL HAMILTONIANS (THE AREA LAW CONJECTURE)? THESE QUESTIONS ADDRESS THE COMPLEXITY OF QUANTUM MANY-BODY SYSTEMS FROM THE VIEW OF THREE WELL-STUDIED MEASURES: LEARNABILITY, APPROXIMABILITY AND ENTANGLEMENT. THIS IS INSPIRED BY THREE SUCCESSFUL WAYS TO MEASURE COMPLEXITY OF A COMPUTATION IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE - TIME COMPLEXITY, SPACE COMPLEXITY AND RANDOMNESS.

THE DATASET BUILT BY THIS PROJECT CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES BY PROVIDING THE MOST DETAILED PICTURE OF EXTANT PRIMATE CRANIAL VARIATION TO DATE AND MAKING THESE DATA OPENLY AVAILABLE THROUGH ONLINE DIGITAL REPOSITORIES. THE PROJECT SUPPORTS EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS WHO ARE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY SCIENTISTS AT A U.S. PRIMARILY UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTION AND CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH AND MENTORSHIP OF STUDENTS. NOVEL CURRICULAR FRAMEWORKS DEVELOPED THROUGH THIS PROJECT INTEGRATE EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH INTO THE CLASSROOM, PROVIDING ACTIVE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND TRAINING RELEVANT FOR HEALTH SCIENCES CAREERS. THESE ACTIVITIES, COMBINED WITH THE MENTORSHIP AND TRAINING OF U.S. UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS, A MASTERS STUDENT, AND A POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR, DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND THE GROWTH OF A DIVERSE SCIENTIFIC WORKFORCE. THIS STUDY PAIRS 3D MORPHOMETRICS WITH PHYLOGENETIC COMPARATIVE METHODS TO TEST EVOLUTIONARY HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE ROLE OF CIRCUMORBITAL MORPHOLOGY IN SHAPING HUMAN CRANIAL EVOLUTION. THE PROJECT LEVERAGES 3D SURFACE SCANS OF THE CRANIUM FOR N=1700 EXTANT HAPLORRHINES AND N=54 FOSSIL HOMINIDS. THESE DATA ARE USED TO ADDRESS THREE MAJOR AIMS: 1) CHARACTERIZE CIRCUMORBITAL MORPHOLOGY IN HOMINIDS AND OTHER PRIMATES, 2) QUANTIFY LEVELS OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN CIRCUMORBITAL MORPHOLOGY AND OTHER SKELETAL STRUCTURES OF THE CRANIUM, AND 3) ASSESS THE ROLES OF BODY SIZE AND SEX IN SHAPING PRIMATE CIRCUMORBITAL MORPHOLOGY. BY BUILDING ON FOUNDATIONAL MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES IN PRIMATES WITH FUNCTIONALLY-INFORMED HYPOTHESES AND NEW PHYLOGENETIC AND EVOLVABILITY METHODS, THIS PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS AND PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO STUDYING HOMINID CRANIAL EVOLUTION.

BUT WHERE CAN HYDROGEN BE STORED AT SCALES LARGE ENOUGH TO IMPACT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF OUR SOCIETY? UNDERGROUND POROUS ROCK FORMATIONS MAY BE ABLE TO STORE AND RETURN HYDROGEN. NATURAL GAS RESERVOIRS HAVE TRAPPED GAS FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS. STORAGE IN DEPLETED GAS RESERVOIRS MAY ALSO PROVIDE NEW ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMUNITIES DEPENDING ON FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION. IT IS UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER HYDROGEN CAN BE STORED IN ROCKS AND RETRIEVED WITHOUT ECONOMIC LOSSES. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE, BESIDE THE SAFETY CONCERNS, HYDROGEN CAN INTERACT WITH MINERALS AND MICROBES IN WAYS THAT ALTER ITS USABILITY AND RESALE VALUE. THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF A HYDROGEN ECONOMY ARE ALSO UNKNOWN. HERE, THE TEAM LEVERAGES EXPERTISE WORLDWIDE TO INVESTIGATE THE SCIENTIFIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, COMMUNITY, AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF UNDERGROUND HYDROGEN STORAGE. THEY CARRY OUT STATE-OF-THE-ART EXPERIMENTS TO UNVEIL THE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF HYDROGEN WHILE STORED WITHIN ROCKS. THE GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST NATURAL RESERVOIRS.

LEVERAGING THE EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE FROM THEIR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATORS, THE RESEARCHERS USE BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED DIRECTLY FROM OWTS, THE WORKERS WHO SERVICE THEM, AND THE DECISION MAKERS WHO ENABLE THEIR DEVELOPMENT. THEIR GOAL IS TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE RESILIENCE OF OFFSHORE WIND TURBINES, NOTABLY WHILE CONFRONTED TO MORE FREQUENT EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. BY IMPROVING OWT SERVICE LIFE, THIS PROJECT PAVES THE WAY TO EFFICIENTLY DEVELOP THE US CLEAN-ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURES. THE PROJECT ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT AND TRAINING TO 1 POSTDOCTORAL ASSOCIATE, AND GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS NOTABLY FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE TEAM DEVELOPS AN EXTENSIBLE AND CUSTOMIZABLE JOINT MODELING FRAMEWORK FOR POLICY AND SAFETY AWARE DIGITAL TWINS. THEY USE A PHYSICS-DATA-POLICY-SAFETY CO-MODELING PARADIGM, INTEGRATED WITH THE HELP OF AGENT BASED MODELS. A DIGITAL TWIN IS A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF AN ACTUAL OWT (OR SYSTEMS OF OWTS) THAT IS MAINTAINED AND UPDATED BASED ON MEASURED DATA. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IS FORMULATED AND STUDIED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE BLOCK ISLAND WIND FARM IN RHODE ISLAND STATE WATERS, THE COASTAL VIRGINIA OFFSHORE WIND PILOT PROJECT, IN US FEDERAL WATERS, AND THE LEVENMOUTH DEMONSTRATION TURBINE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. IT ENABLES SHORT, MEDIUM, AND LONG-TERM MODELING, LEARNING, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE OFFSHORE WIND FARMS. IT USES MEASURED DATA AND INTEGRATE WITH POLICY, LABOR, AND SAFETY ASPECTS. THE MULTI-DOMAIN, MULTI-SCALE NATURE OF THE RENEWABLES AND RELATED STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS IS MODELED BY A PHYSICS-BASED BAYESIAN ASSIMILATION FRAMEWORK. IT IS COMPLEMENTED BY DATA-DRIVEN MACHINE LEARNING AND TRANSFER LEARNING. THE PROJECT INCLUDES NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO FACILITATE A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE CO-PRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE. THE PROJECT HAS INTEGRAL EDUCATIONAL COMPONENTS INCLUDING K-12 OUTREACH, PROFESSIONAL TRAININGS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS WITHIN A TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDED IN THE OFFSHORE WIND INDUSTRY.

IN A RECENT PRESS RELEASE, THE UNITED NATIONS CHILDREN?S FUND (UNICEF) ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION CHILDREN ARE AT EXTREMELY HIGH RISK OF EXPERIENCING IMPACTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS; MANY WILL EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE CLIMATE SHOCKS COMBINED WITH POOR ESSENTIAL SERVICES SUCH AS WATER, SANITATION AND HEALTHCARE. AT THE SAME TIME, WHILE AIR POLLUTION IS DECREASING IN MANY HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES AND SOME MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, IT REMAINS VERY HIGH IN LARGE AREAS OF LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD?S CHILDREN RESIDE. CHILDREN FROM POORER COUNTRIES AND FROM ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS WITHIN COUNTRIES MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS. TO DATE, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A GLOBAL STUDY OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE ILL EFFECTS OF EXTREME CLIMATE AND AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURES ARE BORNE DIFFERENTLY BY CHILDREN ACCORDING TO INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY, AND OVERALL COUNTRY CHARACTERISTICS. FOCUSING ON LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, THIS PROJECT ADVANCES AND DISSEMINATES SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW GLOBAL CHILDHOOD INEQUALITIES CONDITION BOTH THE RISKS OF EXPERIENCING CLIMATE HAZARDS AND EXTREME AIR POLLUTION AND THE IMPLICATIONS, ONCE EXPOSED. PROJECT PARTNERS INCLUDE FACULTY MEMBERS AND STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON AND RESEARCHERS AT THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, THE REGIONAL INSTITUTE FOR POPULATION STUDIES IN GHANA, UNICEF, AND THE WORLD BANK.

IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE LEARN TO TALK; IT IS LESS OBVIOUS THAT WE LEARN TO SEE. BABIES HAVE ROUGHLY 20/400 VISION, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE LEGALLY BLIND, AND THE WORLD INITIALLY LOOKS VERY BLURRY TO THEM. THEY MUST LEARN TO DISTINGUISH PEOPLE (ESPECIALLY THEIR MOTHER AND FAMILY) AS WELL AS TOYS, FOOD, AND OTHER OBJECTS OVER MONTHS AND YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT. HOW IS IT THAT WE COME TO BE ABLE TO SEE SO WELL THAT WE CAN PLAY BALL, READ A BOOK, AND THREAD A NEEDLE? ONE WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HAPPENS IS TO BUILD COMPUTATIONAL MODELS THAT MIMIC THE WAY THE BRAIN WORKS. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS BLOSSOMED IN RECENT YEARS WITH THE ADVENT OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS, WHICH ARE A VERY SIMPLIFIED MODEL OF THE BRAIN. THEY ARE CAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING FACES AND OBJECTS, AND ARE ENABLING THE CREATION OF SELF-DRIVING CARS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE COMPUTER VISION MODELS AND OUR OWN VISUAL SYSTEM THAT MAKE THEM LESS ROBUST. THIS PROJECT WILL ADD MORE FEATURES OF THE HUMAN VISUAL SYSTEM TO THESE MODELS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE A FOVEATED RETINA, WHICH ENABLES HIGH FIDELITY VISION ONLY WITHIN A SMALL SPOT OF THE VISUAL FIELD, ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR THUMBNAIL AT ARM'S LENGTH. AS A RESULT, WE MOVE OUR EYES ABOUT 3 TIMES A SECOND IN ORDER TO BRING THE WORLD INTO FOCUS. THIS PROJECT WILL BUILD A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL THAT HAS A FOVEATED RETINA, MOVES ITS EYES, AND TAKES DATA FROM BRAIN RECORDINGS INTO ACCOUNT. RECENT MODELS OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM HAVE BEEN BENCHMARKED AGAINST CORTICAL RECORDINGS (CORNET, BRAINSCORE), BUT APPEAR TO BE REACHING A PLATEAU. TO MOVE BEYOND THIS, THE NEXT GENERATION OF MODELS WILL HAVE TO COME CLOSER TO THE BRAIN IN BOTH ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. THIS PROJECT WILL INCORPORATE RADICAL CHANGES TO CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS AS WELL AS NOVEL DATA FROM THE PRIMATE VISUAL SYSTEM. MISSING FROM MOST MODELS OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM ARE: 1) BIOLOGICALLY REALISTIC LATERAL AND FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS, INCLUDING DISTINCT POOLS OF EXCITATORY (E) AND INHIBITORY (I) NEURONS WITH THE FULL SET OF LATERAL INTERACTIONS (E->E, E->I, I->E, I->I), AND PURELY EXCITATORY FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; 2) THE LOG-POLAR MAPPING FROM RETINA TO V1, SEPARATING CENTRAL FROM PERIPHERAL REPRESENTATIONS AND ADDING ROTATION AND SCALE INVARIANCE; AND 3) SACCADES, ADDING DYNAMICS TO THE REPRESENTATIONS. MISSING FROM MOST NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS ARE 1) RECORDINGS FROM IT DURING FREE VIEWING OF OBJECTS (SACCADING); 2) PHARMACOLOGICAL SUPPRESSION OF CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL V1 WHILE RECORDING FROM IT IN ORDER TO MEASURE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO REPRESENTATIONS; AND 3) SIMULTANEOUS RECORDING FROM MULTIPLE AREAS OF IT PROVIDING CRUCIAL DATA ON THEIR INTERACTIONS.

A LESS-KNOWN APPLICATION FOR MAGNETISM IS IN REFRIGERATION TECHNOLOGY THROUGH A MECHANISM CALLED THE MAGNETOCALORIC EFFECT (MCE). A MAGNETIC REFRIGERATOR IS SIMILAR TO REGULAR REFRIGERATORS, EXCEPT INSTEAD OF COMPRESSING AND DECOMPRESSING A GAS, IT MAGNETIZES AND DEMAGNETIZES A SOLID-STATE MATERIAL TO CREATE THE LOW TEMPERATURES. MATERIALS USED FOR THIS APPLICATION TYPICALLY CONTAIN RARE-EARTH ELEMENTS, FOR EXAMPLE GADOLINIUM AND ERBIUM. THESE ELEMENTS ARE EXPANSIVE AND NOT READILY AVAILABLE, ESPECIALLY NOT IN THE U.S.. WITH THIS PROJECT, SUPPORTED BY THE SOLID STATE AND MATERIALS CHEMISTRY PROGRAM AND THE CONDENSED MATER PHYSICS PROGRAM IN THE DIVISION OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, THE RESEARCHERS AT BOSTON COLLEGE SYNTHESIZE NEW MATERIALS THAT EXHIBIT A GIANT MCE AND CONTAIN ONLY MINIMAL AMOUNTS OF RARE-EARTH ELEMENTS. IN THIS WAY THE PROJECT ADDRESSES CRITICAL ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABILITY BY ELIMINATING OZONE-DEPLETING REFRIGERATION GASES AND BY MINIMIZING THE RARE-EARTH CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOCALORIC MATERIALS. THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT PROVIDES A PLATFORM FOR TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF MATERIALS SCIENTISTS WITH A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY AND THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE TO SOLVE THE SOCIETAL PROBLEMS. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT PROVIDES CAREER WORKSHOPS FOR PRE-COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IN THE BOSTON AREA AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS FROM JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY, A HBCU. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: MATERIALS THAT EXHIBIT A MAGNETOCALORIC EFFECT (MCE), THE REVERSIBLE CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE AS A FUNCTION OF MAGNETIC FIELD, PROVIDES A SUSTAINABLE PLATFORM FOR REFRIGERATION TECHNOLOGY. MAGNETIC REFRIGERATORS ARE CONSIDERABLY LESS ENERGY CONSUMING THAN REGULAR REFRIGERATORS AND DO NOT RELY ON OZONE-DEPLETING GASES. THE MAIN CHALLENGE FOR COMMERCIALIZING MAGNETIC REFRIGERATORS IS THE LACK OF MATERIALS WITH A LARGE REFRIGERATION CAPACITY (RC) MADE FROM EARTH-ABUNDANT ELEMENTS. GIANT MAGNETOCALORIC MATERIALS ARE EITHER MADE FROM TOXIC ELEMENTS SUCH AS P AND AS, OR HAVE A LARGE RARE-EARTH CONTENT. AS SUCH, THE SYNTHESIS OF GIANT MAGNETOCALORIC MATERIALS THAT ARE NON-TOXIC AND HAVE LITTLE TO NO RARE-EARTH CONTENT IS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF SUSTAINABILITY. WITH THIS SUPPORT RESEARCHERS FROM BOSTON COLLEGE SYNTHESIZE SUCH MATERIALS BY FOLLOWING TWO CHEMICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES, NAMELY NARROW BANDWIDTHS AND COMPETING EXCHANGE INTERACTIONS. THE NARROW BANDWIDTH LEADS TO A MAGNETIC TRANSITION NEAR ROOM TEMPERATURE VIA THE STONER MECHANISM. THE CRITICAL TEMPERATURE CAN BE ADJUSTED BY DOPING, WHICH ENABLES THE DESIGN OF MULTI-STAGE MAGNETIC REFRIGERATORS. COMPETING EXCHANGE INTERACTIONS BROADEN THE MAGNETIC TRANSITION AND LEAD TO ENTROPY RELEASE OVER A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE, THEREBY ENHANCING RC. THE INVESTIGATED MATERIALS HAVE LESS THAN TEN PER CENT RARE-EARTH CONTENT. THE RESEARCHERS ELUCIDATE NOVEL MECHANISMS FOR ACHIEVING GIANT MCE IN THESE MATERIALS WITH MINIMAL RARE-EARTH CONTENT. THE EDUCATIONAL IMPACTS INCLUDE THE ENGAGEMENT OF UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROJECT BETWEEN CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS AS WELL AS TRAINING STUDENTS AT THE NATIONAL HIGH-MAGNETIC FIELD AND SYNCHROTRON RADIATION FACILITIES.

CURRENTLY, THE OPERATION OF BUILDINGS ACCOUNTS FOR 40% OF THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES WITH BUILDINGS PRODUCING ~39% OF PROCESS-RELATED CO2 EMISSIONS GLOBALLY. AT THE SAME TIME AND IN RECENT DECADES, MATERIALS RESEARCH HAS ADVANCED SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGH GROUNDBREAKING WORK ON BIOINSPIRED MATERIALS THAT ARE SMART, ADAPTIVE AND RESPONSIVE. THE IPRISM PROGRAM WILL LEVERAGE THESE ADVANCES BY IMPLEMENTING NEW MATERIAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE BUILDINGS TO SENSE, ADAPT AND RESPOND TO FUNCTIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IN THE PROCESS, THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL IMPROVE THE CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE, AND MAINTENANCE OF BUILDINGS, RESULTING IN LOWER CO2 EMISSIONS AND LOWER ENERGY CONSUMPTION. IN ADDITION, IPRISM WILL BUILD ON THE STRONG PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PENN STATE CENTER FOR LIVING MULTIFUNCTIONAL MATERIALS SYSTEMS AND NORTH CAROLINA A&T IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNIVERSITY OF FREIBURG LIVMATS CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN GERMANY TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION OF U.S. STUDENTS FROM TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN MATERIAL SCIENCE AND RESEARCH ABROAD. THE IPRISM STUDENTS WILL BE GUIDED IN THEIR RESEARCH BY WORLD-RENOWNED EXPERTS AND WILL HAVE ACCESS TO UNIQUE FACILITIES, INCLUDING FULL-SCALE BUILT STRUCTURES THAT INCORPORATE NOVEL AND NATURE-INSPIRED COMPOSITES. THE IPRISM FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL SYNTHETIC ?LIVING? MATERIALS CRITICAL TO IMPROVING THE CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE, AND MAINTENANCE OF BUILDINGS TO INCREASE THEIR ADAPTIVENESS. STUDENT RESEARCH PROJECTS FOCUS ON KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF LIVING MATERIALS CLOSELY INTEGRATED WITH NEEDS IN SUSTAINABLE, RESILIENT AND ADAPTIVE BUILDING DESIGN. IN THE CONSTRUCTION STAGE, BUILDING MATERIALS WILL RESPOND TO LIGHT-TRIGGERS TO ADAPT TO THE ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, AND NATURE-INSPIRED LOAD-ADAPTED COMPOSITES WILL ENABLE SUSTAINABLE AND GREEN BUILDING MATERIALS. DURING THE PERFORMANCE STAGE, RESPONSIVE MATERIALS WILL FACILITATE SMART BUILDING SKINS INTERACTING AUTONOMOUSLY WITH THEIR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND NEW SELF-POWERED MATERIALS WILL LOWER THE ENERGY NEEDS OF BUILDINGS. FINALLY, IN THE MAINTENANCE STAGE, MULTIFUNCTIONAL MATERIALS WILL ADVANCE SENSOR NETWORKS TO MONITOR BUILDING OPERATIONS. OUR TECHNICAL APPROACH RESTS ON STRATEGIES INHERENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENGINEERED SYNTHETIC LIVING MATERIALS AND WELL-SUITED TO EMERGENT APPROACHES AND NEEDS IN REALIZING ADAPTIVE ARCHITECTURE, CONSIDERING AUTONOMOUS ADAPTATION, ROBUSTNESS, RESILIENCE, ENERGY HARVESTING, AND SUSTAINABILITY.

S. AND BEYOND. ONE NOTABLE EXAMPLE IS THE SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP SHORTAGE. THE CHIPS PROCESS DATA AND ENABLE AUTONOMOUS OPERATIONS OF VARIOUS CONSUMER PRODUCTS, IN MANY CASES, WITHOUT DIRECT HUMAN INTERVENTIONS. IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT CHALLENGES, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION ENGINEERS WITH THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE AND COMPETITIVENESS IN THIS TECHNICAL DOMAIN. AMONG THOSE SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP DEVICES, A COLLECTION OF DEVICES THAT CONVERT ONE ENERGY FORM TO ANOTHER IS CALLED TRANSDUCERS. THEY PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN TRANSLATING PHYSICAL EVENTS INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAT COMPUTERS CAN PROCESS. THIS IRES SITE PROGRAM AIMS TO PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL SUMMER RESEARCH EXPERIENCES BY ENGAGING SIX UNDERGRADUATE/GRADUATE STUDENTS EACH YEAR FOR THREE YEARS AT THE EPICENTER OF TRANSDUCER DEVELOPMENT IN KOREA. THE TEAM WILL WORK WITH SIX FOREIGN FACULTY MENTORS AT FOUR DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES TO INNOVATE TRANSDUCER TECHNOLOGIES BY UTILIZING NEWLY DEVELOPED NANOSCALE MATERIALS. THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO EXPOSE THE COHORT STUDENTS TO GLOBAL RESEARCH IN DIFFERENT CULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS AND EQUIP THEM WITH A BROADER RANGE OF SKILLS TO STIMULATE THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THEIR COMPETENCIES CAN BE NURTURED IN THE AREA OF LEADERSHIP, COMMUNICATION, SELF-AWARENESS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR FUTURE CAREERS IN ACADEMIA, CORPORATE, OR GOVERNMENT SECTORS. THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROGRAM WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT AND ADVANCE THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN CHIP MANUFACTURING. RECENTLY EXPLORED LOW-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS IN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS HAVE EXHIBITED UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMERGING DEVICE APPLICATIONS. THEY ARE PARTICULARLY PROMISING FOR TRANSDUCER TECHNOLOGIES WHICH BENEFIT FROM THEIR LARGE SET OF EXTRAORDINARY PROPERTIES SUCH AS ENLARGED SURFACE AREA, OPTICAL/ELECTRICAL TUNABILITY AS WELL AS SUPERIOR MECHANICAL DEFORMABILITY. THIS IRES PROGRAM AIMS TO COMPREHENSIVELY STUDY THE FUNDAMENTALS OF STRUCTURE-PROPERTY-PROCESS RELATIONS IN A VARIETY OF LOW-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS TOWARD EXPLORING THEIR SUITABILITY FOR ADVANCED TRANSDUCER TECHNOLOGIES. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE THE MATERIALS CLASSIFIED BY THEIR PHYSICAL DIMENSION ? I.E., ZERO-DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM DOTS, ONE-DIMENSIONAL NANOWIRES, TWO-DIMENSIONAL GRAPHENE AND TRANSITION METAL DICHALCOGENIDE LAYERS, AS WELL AS THEIR HETEROGENEOUSLY-INTEGRATED HYBRID STRUCTURES. SPECIFICALLY, THE TEAM WILL STRIVE TO UNVEIL THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONTROLLED MANIPULATION OF ELECTRICAL AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES IN THESE MATERIALS AND INVESTIGATE MANUFACTURING METHODOLOGIES TO ASSEMBLE THEM WITH TARGETED GEOMETRIES. THE OBTAINED KNOWLEDGE WILL BE UTILIZED TO DEVELOP VARIOUS TRANSDUCER DEVICE COMPONENTS WITH UNCONVENTIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES SUCH AS MECHANICALLY STRETCHABLE OPTICAL/ELECTRICAL SENSORS AND ENERGY STORAGE ELECTRODES.

SAIL WILL RECRUIT SIX (6) UNDERGRADUATE MINORITY STUDENTS PER YEAR FROM INTER AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO (IAUPR) TO PARTICIPATE IN A 9-WEEK RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOCUSING ON THE DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ADVANCED NANOMATERIALS FOR ELECTRONIC AND PHOTONIC APPLICATIONS. CURRENTLY, NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY ARE UTILIZED IN MANY PUBLIC SECTORS, SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION, MEDICINE, AND ENERGY. HOWEVER, NANOTECHNOLOGY DEPENDS ON THE EXISTENCE AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NEW NANOMATERIALS. THE CONTROL OF NANOMATERIALS' COMPOSITION, SIZE, SHAPE, AND MORPHOLOGY ARE ESSENTIAL, AND THEIR COMPLEX FUNCTIONS REQUIRE FURTHER ADVANCEMENT IN PREPARATION AND MODIFICATION. FOR THIS REASON, THE DESIGN AND STUDY OF ADVANCED NANOMATERIALS ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY AND THE FUTURE. SAIL SCHOLARS WILL CONDUCT MENTORED, HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND DEVELOP THE NECESSARY SKILLS TO MANAGE HIGH-PERFORMANCE EQUIPMENT. TWO INDEPENDENT CAMPUSES OF THE INTER AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO, BAYAMON CAMPUS (IAUPR-BC) AND PONCE CAMPUS (IAUPR-PC) WILL ESTABLISH A COLLABORATIVE NETWORK TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS IN THIS RESEARCH EXPERIENCE. SAIL SCHOLARS WILL WORK ON MULTIDISCIPLINARY (PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, AND MATERIAL SCIENCE) PROJECTS BUT WITH A UNIFYING THEME THAT ENABLES A COHORT EXPERIENCE UNDER THE MENTORING OF EXPERT RESEARCHERS. THE RESULTS OF THE PROJECTS WILL GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE. THE SKILLS DEVELOPED BY MULTIDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH WILL HELP STUDENTS IN THEIR FUTURE CAREERS AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES. THE INTERNATIONAL AND CROSS-DISCIPLINARY COMPONENT OF THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE GOES BEYOND WHAT IS ORDINARILY AVAILABLE TO LOW-INCOME UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN PUERTO RICO. THE IAUPR IS A PRIVATE UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTION WITH 99% HISPANIC, PRIMARILY FIRST-GENERATION/LOW-INCOME STUDENTS. THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WILL IMPACT UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IN STEM, ENABLING CROSS-DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND PROMOTING CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN A COHORT MODEL. A GENDER BALANCE WILL BE SOUGHT DURING THE SELECTION PROCESS, AS HISPANIC WOMEN ARE EVEN MORE UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE STEM COMMUNITY. STUDENTS WILL PRESENT THEIR RESEARCH PROJECTS AT REGIONAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES TO IMPROVE THEIR NETWORKING AND PRESENTATION SKILLS. THE COLLABORATION AMONG CAMPUSES AND THE INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE WILL STRENGTHEN RESEARCH, EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES, AND MOBILITY FOR MINORITY STUDENTS. THE SAIL PROJECT WILL IMPACT THE IAUPR SYSTEM AND THE ISLAND BY COMBINING PROGRAM ACTIVITIES AND DISSEMINATION EFFORTS. THE ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF THE PROJECT ARE AN INCREASE IN THE RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES, DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH AND INTERNATIONAL SKILLS FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS (SELF-EFFICACY IN STEM) AND ENHANCED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO DECIDE TO PURSUE GRADUATE STUDIES (PERSISTENCE IN STEM).

ONE OF THE REASONS THAT DUST IS SO ABUNDANT IS THAT IT HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, PERHAPS EVEN DOUBLED, SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. THIS LARGE INCREASE IS PROBABLY BECAUSE OF HUMAN ACTIONS LIKE CLEARING LAND FOR AGRICULTURE. SURPRISINGLY, THE IMPACT OF THE INCREASING DESERT DUST ON THE CLIMATE SYSTEM HAS REMAINED MYSTERIOUS. IN FACT, IT IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER THIS HISTORICAL INCREASE IN DUST HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OR COUNTERACTED GREENHOUSE GAS WARMING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM. THIS PROJECT WILL ANSWER THIS QUESTION BY (I) DETERMINING THE CHANGE IN EARTH?S ENERGY BUDGET PRODUCED BY THE SCATTERING AND ABSORBING OF SOLAR AND TERRESTRIAL RADIATION BY DUST, (II) DETERMINING THE AMOUNT BY WHICH DUST HAS INCREASED SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, AND (III) DETERMINING THE RESULTANT CHANGE IN EARTH?S ENERGY BUDGET FROM THE INCREASE IN DUST. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY COMBINING SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS, AIRCRAFT MEASUREMENTS, NUMEROUS RECORDS OF HOW DEPOSITION OF DESERT DUST HAS CHANGED ACROSS THE WORLD, AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF HOW DUST AFFECTS EARTH?S RADIATION BUDGET. THE RESEARCH WILL BE PERFORMED BY A TEAM OF SCIENTISTS THAT INCLUDE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AND A POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR. DETERMINING THE CLIMATE IMPACT OF THE HISTORICAL INCREASE IN DESERT DUST IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE CALCULATIONS OF HOW SENSITIVE THE CLIMATE SYSTEM IS TO GREENHOUSE WARMING DEPEND ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH GREENHOUSE WARMING HAS BEEN COUNTERACTED BY COOLING PRODUCED BY PARTICULATE MATTER LIKE DUST. THIS PROJECT WILL THUS RESULT IN MORE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE CLIMATE CHANGES PRODUCED BY FUTURE INCREASES IN GREENHOUSE GASES, WHICH IS CRITICAL TO AN EFFECTIVE SOCIETAL RESPONSE TO THOSE CHANGES.

TO DESIGN SAFE, TRUSTWORTHY AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS, THERE IS A NEED TO TRANSFORM HOW INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS INTERACT, INFLUENCE, AND PREDICT HUMAN AGENTS. THIS FACULTY EARLY CAREER DEVELOPMENT (CAREER) PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON THE UNDERSTANDING HOW HUMANS AND MOBILE ROBOTS CAN AND SHOULD INTERACT. FIRST, PREDICTING HUMAN TRAJECTORIES IN CROWDED SPACES THROUGH STRUCTURED REPRESENTATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED. SECOND, ROBOT STRATEGIES FOR USING THESE PREDICTIONS FOR INTELLIGENT DECISION-MAKING WILL BE CONSIDERED. THE AIM IS TO BALANCE EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY, GUARANTEEING RELIABLE PERFORMANCE EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF ERRATIC HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND SENSOR UNCERTAINTY. THE APPROACHES WILL BE EVALUATED ON REAL-WORLD ROBOTS, MOTIVATED BY HIGH-IMPACT PROBLEM DOMAINS, INCLUDING AGRICULTURAL ROBOTS (WHICH IS CURRENTLY FACING A LABOR CRISIS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR ROBOTICS); COLLABORATIVE MANUFACTURING (WHICH IS SEEING A RISE IN POPULARITY OF CO-ROBOTS); AND TRANSPORTATION (WHERE BEHAVIOR PREDICTION AND INTERACTION REMAINS ONE OF KEY CHALLENGES FOR AUTONOMY).

THE FIRST STAGE OF CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IS OFTEN THE NUCLEATION OF SMALL VOIDS, THROUGH A COMPLEX AND MULTIFACETED PROCESS THAT HAS SO FAR EVADED SIMPLIFIED MODELS. THIS PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING METHODS, WHICH CAN IDENTIFY SUBTLE TRENDS IN LARGE DATASETS, WITH DAMAGE MECHANICS MODELS TO UNRAVEL THE NUANCES OF PORE NUCLEATION. THE RESULT WILL BE A COMPUTER MODEL THAT IS ABLE TO RAPIDLY SCREEN MATERIALS TO DETERMINE DAMAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY. THE EDUCATIONAL PART OF THIS PROJECT IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, THE PROJECT WILL MAKE ADVANCES IN MACHINE LEARNING-BASED MECHANICS OF MATERIALS ACCESSIBLE TO BUDDING AND AMATEUR ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS THROUGH AN INTERNET-BASED APPLICATION, CALLED ?SOLID GENIUS.? SOLID GENIUS WILL BE FREELY AVAILABLE, ALLOWING DIRECT MANIPULATION AND EXPLORATION OF THE MATERIAL MODEL AND ITS PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY THROUGH A USER-FRIENDLY EDUCATIONAL INTERFACE. SECOND, THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A NEW GRADUATE COURSE TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR RISING RESEARCHERS IN MACHINE LEARNING-BASED DAMAGE MECHANICS. EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT GRAIN BOUNDARIES ARE PREFERENTIAL SITES FOR PORE NUCLEATION, BUT NO MEANINGFUL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN GRAIN BOUNDARY PROPERTIES AND FAILURE LIKELIHOOD HAVE YET BEEN CONCLUSIVELY ESTABLISHED. A MULTI-CHANNEL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (MCCNN) MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK IS PLANNED THAT WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PORE NUCLEATION SITES IN PRISTINE MICROSTRUCTURE. THE FRAMEWORK WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY ACCOUNT FOR BOTH NONLOCAL PROPERTIES (MICROSTRUCTURE, GRAIN TEXTURE, ETC.)

THE SIZE OF AN EARTHQUAKE AND THE PROPENSITY OF AN EARTHQUAKE TO CREATE LARGE DANGEROUS TSUNAMIS IS DETERMINED BY VARIATIONS IN THE PLATE INTERFACE COUPLING WHICH CREATES LOCKED AND UNLOCKED REGIONS OF THE FAULT. UNDERSTANDING THESE VARIATIONS IN PLATE COUPLING IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THESE DANGEROUS EARTHQUAKES. STRAIN IS RELEASED ALONG SOME OFFSHORE PARTS OF FAULT INTERFACES IN OCCASIONAL SLOW SLIP EVENTS (SSES) WHERE THE FAULT MOVES MUCH AS WITH A NORMAL EARTHQUAKE, BUT THE STORED ENERGY IS RELEASED SO SLOWLY THAT THESE EVENTS ARE BARELY OR NOT DETECTABLE ON LAND. REGIONS BETWEEN THE SSE REGIONS MAY REMAIN LOCKED, PRODUCING THE POTENTIAL FOR LARGE TSUNAMIGENIC EARTHQUAKES. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT SSES ON ONE PART OF A PLATE INTERFACE MAY INCREASE STRAIN ON ADJACENT PARTS, TRIGGERING LARGE EARTHQUAKES. SEAFLOOR PRESSURE GAUGES CAN DETECT SSES AS THE SEAFLOOR MOVES UPWARD DURING A SSE, DECREASING THE DEPTH OF THE GAUGE. A SSE WAS DETECTED AND MAPPED IN THE PROPOSED STUDY REGION OFFSHORE NEW ZEALAND IN 2015 USING PRESSURE GAUGES, AS THIS IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY FEASIBLE METHOD APPROPRIATE FOR WIDE APPLICATION OFFSHORE. THOSE OBSERVATIONS WERE GREATLY LIMITED BY THE EFFECTS OF OCEANOGRAPHIC NOISE FROM OCEAN EDDIES. A MUCH LARGER EXPERIMENT IS NOW PLANNED FOR THE SAME REGION. BY ADDING OCEANOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS OF NEAR-SEAFLOOR CURRENT AND VERTICAL ECHO SOUNDER DATA, THE RESEARCH SHOULD SHOW THIS NOISE SOURCE CAN BE MUCH REDUCED AND THEREFORE REVEAL THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL EXTENT OF OFFSHORE SSES IN GREATER DETAIL AND WITH BETTER ACCURACY, IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PLATE COUPLING RELEVANT TO UNDERSTANDING GREAT EARTHQUAKES. THE PROJECT WILL TRAIN A GRADUATE STUDENT AND POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER AND INVOLVE THEM IN A LARGE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIMENT. DURING THIS LARGE COLLABORATIVE EXPERIMENT WITH NEW ZEALAND AND JAPANESE SCIENTISTS, A LARGE ARRAY OF OCEAN BOTTOM GEODETIC, OCEANOGRAPHIC, AND SEISMOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS WILL BE DEPLOYED FOR TWO YEARS OFFSHORE OF THE EAST COAST OF NEW ZEALAND'S NORTH ISLAND, WHERE ONE OR MORE SHALLOW SSES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING THE DEPLOYMENT. THE JOINT ARRAY WOULD INCLUDE 44 SEAFLOOR ABSOLUTE PRESSURE GAUGES (APGS) AND 12 CURRENT METERS AND UPWARD LOOKING SONARS TO TEST AND DEVELOP INNOVATIVE METHODS TO REMOVE CONTAMINATING PRESSURE VARIATIONS THAT ARISE WITHIN THE WATER COLUMN (LABELED OCEANOGRAPHIC NOISE). THE REDUCED-NOISE SEAFLOOR DATA WILL ENABLE MORE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF OFFSHORE SLOW-SLIP EVENTS (SSES). FOR THE FIRST TIME, AN ARRAY OF 11 APG SENSORS EQUIPPED WITH A SYSTEM FOR REMOVING LONG TERM DRIFT FROM SENSOR DATA WILL BE DEPLOYED, WITH POTENTIAL LONG TERM BENEFIT FOR OCEANOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS AND FOR APPLYING SEAFLOOR VERTICAL GEODESY AT TECTONIC STRAIN RATES. DATA FROM 21 OCEAN BOTTOM SEISMOMETERS IN THE COMBINED ARRAY WILL BE USED TO PROBE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EARTHQUAKES AND TREMOR AND SEAFLOOR SSES.

THE ECOPHYSIOLOGY OF ENERGY BALANCE IN VIENNA, AUSTRIA -THIS AWARD AIMS TO GROW A GLOBALLY ENGAGED U.S. SCIENTIFIC WORKFORCE BY PROVIDING AN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE IN VIENNA, AUSTRIA TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF U.S. UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. FIVE STUDENTS PER YEAR WILL CONDUCT INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH PROJECTS ON ENERGY BALANCE IN VERTEBRATES (INCLUDING HIBERNATING DORMICE AND MIGRATORY BIRDS), MENTORED BY A DYNAMIC GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL ECOPHYSIOLOGY RESEARCHERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY LIFE SCIENCES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE IN VIENNA. UNDERSTANDING HOW VARIOUS VERTEBRATE ANIMALS CHOOSE TO ALLOCATE ENERGY RESOURCES UNDER DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IS IMPORTANT FOR PREDICTING HOW THOSE ANIMALS MIGHT RESPOND TO A CHANGING CLIMATE. ON THEIR RETURN TO NORTH TEXAS, STUDENTS WILL PRESENT THE RESULTS AND BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR RESEARCH ON THESE TOPICS AND THEIR TRAVEL EXPERIENCE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. COMPARATIVE ECOPHYSIOLOGY PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THE STRATEGIES BY WHICH VARIOUS VERTEBRATES AT DIFFERENT LIFE STAGES COPE WITH EXTREME ENERGY DEMANDS UNDER A POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE. HIBERNATORS GAIN EXTENSIVE BODY FAT TO FUEL SURVIVAL OVER MONTHS OF APHAGIA, AND HAVE LIFESPANS LONGER THAN PREDICTED FOR THEIR BODY SIZE. MIGRATORY BIRDS EXPEND IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF ENERGY TO FUEL CONTINENT-SCALE MIGRATIONS, BUT ALSO MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT ENERGY FOR COSTLY BREEDING BEHAVIORS AND COURTSHIP DISPLAYS. UNDERSTANDING THE COMMON STRATEGIES BY WHICH BIRDS AND MAMMALS MANAGE ENERGY ALLOCATION IN DIFFERENT SEASONS MAY PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE ABILITY OF THESE ORGANISMS TO DEAL WITH THE LIKELY PERTURBATIONS OF FOOD AVAILABILITY DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. IRES PARTICIPANT PROJECTS FALL INTO 3 MAIN CATEGORIES: 1) EFFECTS OF EARLY-LIFE CALORIC RESTRICTION (ON HIBERNATION AND AGEING IN DORMICE, AND ON MIGRATORY BEHAVIOR IN BIRDS); 2) COST/BENEFIT DECISIONS OF ARRIVAL TIME AND BREEDING BEHAVIOR IN MIGRATORY BIRDS; 3) REGULATION OF METABOLIC COSTS OF COURTING BEHAVIOR IN BIRDS. IRES STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN A SEMESTER-LONG HALF CREDIT PRE-DEPARTURE COURSE PROVIDING TRAINING IN CULTURAL COMPETENCY, NECESSARY TECHNICAL SKILLS, AND PROJECT DESIGN IN COLLABORATION WITH THEIR INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH MENTORS. DURING THEIR 7 WEEKS IN VIENNA, STUDENTS WILL CARRY OUT THEIR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, PRESENT ON THEIR FINDINGS, AND WRITE UP A PROJECT REPORT THAT WHERE APPROPRIATE MAY BE SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION. ON THEIR RETURN TO THE US, STUDENTS WILL PRESENT THEIR RESEARCH TO PEER, SCIENTIFIC, AND GENERAL AUDIENCES IN A VARIETY OF LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL VENUES.
