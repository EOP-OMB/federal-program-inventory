VERMONT IS SERVED BY 10 TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES AND ONE CONTRACTOR WHICH PROVIDE SERVICE TO THE ENTIRE STATE (SEE ATTACHED). THE DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS PROGRAM RUNS A STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF VANS AND VOLUNTEER DRIVERS TO TRANSPORT VETERANS TO THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL IN WHITE RIVER JUNCTION. IN ADDITION THE VA RUNS ACCESSIBLE VANS BUT THEY ARE ONLY ABLE TO TRANSPORT THOSE VETERANS WITH A 10-30% DISABILITY FOR A SPECIFIC SERVICE RELATED INJURY AND FOR ANY MEDICAL REASON OVER 30% DISABILITY.THESE REQUIREMENTS LEAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF TRANSPORTATION NEEDS UNMET AND A GREATER NEED TO ENHANCE THE AWARENESS OF THE NON-DAV SERVICE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO CURRENT AND EX MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES.

THE RHODE ISLAND TRANSPORTATION 2030 GROUND TRANSPORTATION PLAN (GTP) APPROVED AUGUST 8 2009 INCLUDES A POLICY AND STRATEGY TO: EXTEND BOSTON-PROVIDENCE COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE SOUTH IN INCREMENTAL STEPS TO T.F. GREEN STATE AIRPORT AND WICKFORD JUNCTION UNDER A PHASE I START-UP SERVICE. THIS NEW SERVICE MEETS THE GOALS OF THE GTP TO- REDUCE CONGESTION: THE SCCR PROJECT WILL IMPROVE MOBILITY AND REDUCE CONGESTION ALONG INTERSTATE 95 AND ROUTE 1/ROUTE 4 CORRIDORS.- GLOBAL CONNECTIVITY: THE SCCR PROJECT PROVIDES NEEDED INTERMODAL CONNECTIONS TO T.F. GREEN AIRPORT AT WARWICK INTERMODAL STATION. THE CONNECTION WILL FOSTER REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTRACT NEW COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING THE WARWICK REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT AT T.F. GREEN AIRPORT.- ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP: THE SCCR PROJECT WILL TAKE DRIVERS OUT OF SINGLE OCCUPANT AUTOMOBILES OPERATING ON EXISTING RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE.RIDOT IS EXTENDING COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE ALONG THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR FROM PROVIDENCE TO WICKFORD JUNCTION/NORTH KINGSTOWN IN THE SOUTH COUNTY REGION OF THE STATE. THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR IS CURRENTLY USED FOR THRU AMTRAK AND FREIGHT OPERATIONS. THE EXTENSION OF COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE REPRESENTS A NEW LOCAL/REGIONAL PASSENGER SERVICE IN THE CORRIDOR. THE NEW COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE AUGMENTING EXISTING PROVIDENCE TO BOSTON SERVICE IS SCHEDULED TO BE INTRODUCED IN THREE PHASES: PHASE I WHICH BEGAN ON DECEMBER 6 2010 INCLUDES 3 ROUNDTRIPS FROM PROVIDENCE TO WARWICK. PHASE II WILL INCLUDE 8 ROUNDTRIPS FROM PROVIDENCE TO WARWICK. PHASE III WILL INCLUDE 8 ROUNDTRIPS FROM PROVIDENCE TO WICKFORD. LENGTH: THE SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED IS 20-MILES IN LENGTH AND WILL OPERATE WITHIN THE EXISTING AMTRAK RIGHT-OF-WAY.NUMBER OF STATIONS: A NEW STATION HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED AT WARWICK AND ANOTHER IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT WICKFORD JUNCTION/NORTH KINGSTOWN. THE NEW STATION AT WICKFORD JUNCTION WILL CONSIST OF AN 800-FOOT HIGH-LEVEL PLATFORM WITH CANOPIES. THE WARWICK STATION WAS FUNDED SEPARATELY WITH A MIX OF FUNDS INCLUDING FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION (FHWA) FUNDS A TIFIA LOAN AND REVENUE BONDS. THE RHODE ISLAND FHWA DIVISION OFFICE WORKED WITH RIDOT ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS INTERMODAL FACILITY AS A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT PROJECT WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 2010.VEHICLES: IN SEPTEMBER 2004 THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION (FTA) ISSUED A LETTER OF NO PREJUDICE (LONP) FOR PROCUREMENT OF FIVE COMMUTER RAIL CAR COACHES FOR THE SCCR AT A TOTAL COST OF $11.5 MILLION. THE LONP ALLOWED RIDOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A PROCUREMENT THROUGH AN EXISTING MBTA VEHICLE OPTION THEREBY ACHIEVING COST SAVINGS AND A VEHICLE DELIVERY DATE IN TIME TO MEET THE SCCR REVENUE OPERATIONS DATE (ROD). THE VEHICLES ARE NEEDED FOR THE START-UP FOR THE SCCR (WARWICK AND/OR WICKFORD JUNCTION). ALL FIVE VEHICLES HAVE BEEN DELIVERED. DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD AS THE NEW STATIONS ARE BEING DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED THE COACHES WILL BE UTILIZED TO IMPROVE SERVICE TO PROVIDENCE. THE COACHES WERE FUNDED UNDER THREE SEPARATE FTA GRANTS; RI-03-0037 - $4385000 RI-03-0032 - $5625000 AND RI-90-X052 - $15000000.RIDERSHIP FORECAST: THE CURRENT COMMUTER SERVICE TO PROVIDENCE CARRIES 1000 DAILY PASSENGERS. AS A RESULT OF THE EXTENSION RIDOT FORECASTS 2300 NEW DAILY RIDERS BY YEAR 2020.ON AUGUST 25 2008 AN ACCESS AGREEMENT WAS EXECUTED WITH AMTRAK TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE ON THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR MAIN LINE SECTIONS UPON WHICH THE COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE WILL OPERATE AND TO MAINTAIN THE SEPARATE COMMUTER RAIL/FREIGHT TRACK.

NOW THIS GRANT IS FOR PHASE II OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW FERRY TERMINAL AT THE MUNICIPALITY OF CATAO.---------------------------------THE PUERTO RICO PORTS AUTHORITY ALWAYS PURSUING TO OFFER A BETTER SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO HAVE DECIDED TO BUILD A NEW FERRYBOAT TERMINAL BUILDING TO REPLACE THE EXISTING FACILITIES OF THE ACUA-EXPRESO FERRYBOAT TERMINAL AT THE MUNICIPALITY OF CATAO.THE EXISTING FERRYBOAT TERMINAL WHICH DATES BACK TO THE 1960S IS IN A VERY DETERIORATED STRUCTURAL CONDITION AND TO REPAIR OR RECONSTRUCT THE EXISTING STRUCTURE IS BEYOND A FEASIBLE SOLUTION. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW TERMINAL WILL RESULT IN AN ECONOMICAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.THIS IS A 3 YEAR PROJECT WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CREATE NEW CONSTRUCTION JOBS WILL PROVIDE FERRY RIDERS WITH AN EFFICIENT COST EFFECTIVE AND ATTRACTIVE TERMINAL BUILDING TO ACCOMMODATE THOUSANDS OF COMMUTERS AND TOURISTS WHO RIDE THE FERRIES EACH DAY. THE AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME OF PASSENGERS IN THE CATAO TO SAN JUAN / SAN JUAN TO CATAO ROUTE IS APPROXIMATED TO 6300 PASSENGERS (DIVISION OF STATISTICS- APRIL 2006). THIS FIGURE CONSISTS MAINLY OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE BY THE CATAO AREA AND WORK IN SAN JUAN OR VISE VERSA.THIS NEW TERMINAL WILL ENHANCE THE REVITALIZATION OF CATAO. THIS PROJECT WILL BE FINANCED BY A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL AND LOCAL FUNDS.THE NEW TERMINAL WILL BE BUILT ON THE SAME PROPERTY NEXT TO THE EXISTING TERMINAL WHICH WILL REMAIN OPERATIONAL AND WILL ALLOW THE CATAO FERRIES TO OPERATE CONTINUOUSLY WITHOUT INTERUPTION DURING CONSTRUCTION. AFTER THE NEW TERMINAL IS BUILT THE OLD ONE WILL BE DEMOLISHED.THE NEW TERMINAL WILL ENCOURAGE MORE USE OF THE FERRIES AND A KEY COMPONENT TO THIS IS IMPROVING THE FACILITIES IN CATAO. THIS IS A DAY THAT COMMUTERS HAVE LONG BEEN WAITING FOR A MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING ATMOSPHERE MORE FUNCTIONAL WAITING ROOM SPACE AND IMPROVED ACCESS TO BOATS. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS THE FIRST STEP IN MAKING THESE MUCH-NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS A REALITY.THE NEW FERRYBOAT TERMINAL WILL HAVE A PHYSICAL DIMENSION OF (240-0) LONG BY (311-8) WIDE AT ITS WIDEST DIMENSION AND A GROSS AREA OF 31701.2 SQUARE FEET (2948.9 SQUARE METERS). THIS REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF A HUNDRED FORTY THREE PERCENT (143%) IN AREA IF COMPARED TO THE EXISTING FACILITIES.THIS NEW TERMINAL WILL OPERATE 6 NEW FERRY VESSELS. THREE OF THESE VESSELS HAVE A MAXIMUM PASSENGER CAPACITY OF 49 PEOPLE AND THE OTHER 3 VESSELS OF 149 PASSENGERS. IN CASE OF A CONTINGENCY THERE WILL BE A SPARE VESSEL SO THAT DAILY OPERATIONS WONT BE AFFECTED. THE HOURS OF OPERATIONS FOR THIS NEW FERRY TERMINAL WILL BE FROM 4:30AM TO 10:00PM TO ASSURE EVERY PASSENGERS RIDE WITH AN AMPLE RANGE OF SERVICE TIME OPERATION IN THAT WAY MEETING WITH THEIR SERVICE NEEDS (SEE FLEET MGMT. PLAN ATTACHED)THE NEW PROGRAMMED AREAS FOR THIS PROJECT CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING: FOUR COMMERCIAL AREAS OR CONCESSIONS A LIGHT MECHANICAL INSPECTION / REPARATION AREA FOR THE FERRYBOATS (NO HEAVY MECHANICAL LABOR SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN THE PREMISES SINCE THEY ARE PERFORMED IN THE OTHER DESIGNATED AREAS AT ISLA GRANDE) TWO PASSENGER WAITING AREAS (CATAO - SAN JUAN AND CATAO - HATO REY) SEVERAL AREAS FOR UTILITY ROOM SERVICE AND STORAGE EMPLOYEES LOUNGE EQUIPPED WITH KITCHENETTE LOCKERS AND BATHROOMS.THE NEW BUILDING WILL HAVE SEVERAL PHYSICAL AS WELL AS TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE EXISTING FACILITIES SUCH AS PROVIDING BATHROOMS FOR THE HANDICAPPED AND CHILDRENS FEEDING / CHANGING AREAS. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ELECTRIC AND ILLUMINATION SYSTEM OF THE BUILDING AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE DETECTION SYSTEMS AGAINST FIRE HAZARDS SUCH AS SMOKE DETECTORS FIRE ALARMS AUTOMATIC EMERGENCIES EXIT DOORS FIRE HOSES AND FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ETC. THE COMMERCIAL AREAS EMPLOYEES LOUNGE OFFICES AND CASHIERS STATION WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS.THE PROPOSAL FOR THE NEW FERRYBOAT TERMINAL INCLUDES TWO (2) FLOATING BOARDING/DEBOARDING PLATFORMS EACH ONE WITH AN AREA 400 OF SQUARE FEET THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY COMPENSATE THE ANNUAL TIDAL CHANGES OF THE BAY. THIS NEW SYSTEM WILL REPLACE THE MECHANICAL PLATFORMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED WHICH REQUIRE EXTENSIVE MAINTENANCE TO WORK EFFICIENTLY. ALSO PARKING AREAS FOR THE PUERTO RICO PORTS AUTHORITY EMPLOYEES AND GENERAL PUBLIC WILL BE PROVIDED ON SITE. FOR THE ELECTRICAL BACK-UP SERVICE A DIESEL EMERGENCY GENERATOR IS PROPOSED AT AN ADJACENT STRUCTURE TO THE TERMINAL.THE EXPECTED COMPLETION DATE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF THE PROJECT OF THE FERRY TERMINAL OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF CATAO IS DECEMBER 2011.THE TOTAL CONSTRUCTION COST IS $23800000. THE FTA HAD PREVIOUSLY APPROVED $11016302 IN GRANT #PR-03-0049-02 FROM FUNDS 5309 FOR THE YEARS CONCERNING 2001 THROUGH 2005.

THIS COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN A FULL BUILD-OUT OF THE CAMPUS. THESE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF THE 2013 RTS CAMPUS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT.IN CONNECTION WITH THE GRANT AMENDMENT FOR STATE OF GOOD REPAIR FUNDS RGRTAS BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS ADOPTED A PROGRAM OF PROJECTS ON MARCH 7 2013 IDENTIFYING THESE FUNDS. RGRTA CONDUCTED A PUBLIC HEARING ON ITS POP ON MARCH 26 2013. NO ONE OTHER THAN RGRTA STAFF ATTENDED. AS SUCH NO COMMENTS WERE RECEIVED. ACCORDINGLY THE POP ADOPTED ON MARCH 7 2013 IS RGRTAS FINAL AND ADOPTED POP.THE FUNDS WERE USED TO UNDERTAKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT. RGRTA AND THE FTA CONCLUDED THAT AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHOD TO FULFILL THE NEPA REQUIREMENTS. RGRTA ENGAGED THE SERVICES OF AKRF CONSULTANTS AND THE LAW FIRM OF AKIN GUMP STRAUSS HAUER AND FELD LLP TO UNDERTAKE THIS PROCESS AND DEVELOP THE REQUIRED REPORT.THE 2013 RTS CAMPUS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF 21 PARCELS ADJACENT TO THE RTS 1372 EAST MAIN STREET CAMPUS. THIS SCOPE WILL INCLUDE LAND ACQUISITION ASSOCIATED PROPERTY APPRAISAL SERVICES AND RELOCATION SERVICES. RGRTA HAS ALREADY HAD EXTENSIVE OUTREACH TO THE AFFECTED PROPERTY OWNERS AND TENANTS. THIS OUTREACH HAS INCLUDED PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE GROUPS. WE ANTICIPATE USING THREE (3) INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL FIRMS AND A SINGLE RELOCATION FIRM.RGRTA INTENDS TO UTILIZE THE DESIGN-BUILD METHODOLOGY FOR DELIVERING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT. IN PREPARATION FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF THE REQUIRED DESIGN-BUILD SERVICES RGRTA SOLICITED PROPOSALS FOR A DESIGN-BUILD CRITERIA CONSULTANT TO BRING THE PROJECT TO 30% DESIGN PREPARE A REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ) AND A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). FURTHER THE DESIGN-BUILD CRITERIA CONSULTANT WILL SERVE AS OWNERS REPRESENTATIVE DURING THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES. POPLI DESIGN GROUP WAS SELECTED TO UNDERTAKE THIS WORK. THE SCOPE OF WORK FOR THE DESIGN-BUILD CONTRACTOR INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING: FINAL DESIGN SERVICES OPERATIONS BUILDING GENERAL RENOVATIONS CHAMBERLAIN STREET/HAYWARD AVENUE STREET PARKING (INCLUDES DEMOLITION) REMEDIATION AT CHAMBERLAIN STREET/HAYWARD AVENUE HOUSE SITES SITE LIGHTING REMOVAL AND REMEDIATION OF TWO (2) OF FUEL OIL USTS AT OPERATIONS BUILDING (THESE TANKS WERE INSTALLED IN THE 1970S) FOUR (4) REPLACEMENT PLATFORM LIFTS REPLACEMENT OF THE OPERATIONS BUILDING EMERGENCY GENERATOR AND CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MAINTENANCE WAREHOUSE BUILDING.IN ADDITION SEPARATE PROCUREMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR THE PURCHASE OF TWO (2) ADDITIONAL SETS OF PORTABLE BUS LIFTS REPLACEMENT OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE OVERHEAD EXHAUST HOSES FOR THE OPERATIONS BUILDING AND THE DESIGN AND INSTALLATION OF FALL ARREST STATIONS AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE OPERATIONS BUILDING (FALL ARREST STATIONS ARE FOR THE PROTECTION OF WORKERS WHEN PERFORMING MAINTENANCE WORK ON TOP OF BUSES).AS PART OF THE WORK COVERED UNDER THE PREVIOUS AMENDMENT TO THIS GRANT RGRTA UNDERTOOK THE REPLACEMENT OF ITS BUS FUELING SYSTEM ON THE RTS CAMPUS. DURING THE DESIGN OF THE NEW SYSTEM IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TWO (2) TANKS RATHER THAN A SINGLE TANK WERE MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE AUTHORITY AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE.

RGRTA CONDUCTED A PUBLIC HEARING ON ITS POP ON FEBRUARY 21 2011. NO ONE OTHER THAN RGRTA STAFF ATTENDED. AS SUCH NO COMMENTS WERE RECEIVED. ACCORDINGLY THE POP ADOPTED ON FEBRUARY 3 2011 IS RGRTAS FINAL AND ADOPTED POP.RGRTA UTILIZED FUNDS UNDER THE INITIAL GRANT TO HAVE A STUDY PERFORMED BY STANTEC CONSULTING TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE RGRTAS LONG-TERM FACILITY NEEDS. THIS COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN A FULL BUILD-OUT OF THE CAMPUS. THESE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF AN ADDITIONAL PHASE (PHASE III).A NUMBER OF THE PROJECTS THAT COMPRISE PHASE II OF THE PROJECT WERE NOT EVALUATED AS PART OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THAT RESULTED IN A CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 12 2010. AS A RESULT RGRTA HAS SPLIT PHASE II OF THE PROJECT INTO A PHASE IIA AND PHASE IIB. RGRTA INTENDS TO FUND PORTIONS OF ALL THREE PHASES UNDER THIS AMENDMENT. THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS BEING MANAGED BY RGRTAS ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE PROCUREMENT GRANTS ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT.PHASE I PHASE I OF THE PROJECT INCLUDES AN ADDITION TO RGRTAS ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING AND A TEMPORARY PARKING LOT. RGRTA INTENDS TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL $287012 ($358765 MATCHED) IN FUNDS FOR PHASE I OF THE PROJECT. THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR A NUMBER OF NECESSARY CHANGES TO THE PROJECT INCLUDING COMPUTER NETWORK EQUIPMENT UPGRADED COMPUTER NETWORK CABLING AND SOIL REMEDIATION. THESE ELEMENTS WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THE PROJECT. RGRTA WILL INCLUDE THIS WORK IN A CHANGE ORDER TO RGRTAS EXISTING DESIGN-BUILD CONTRACT WITH THE PIKE COMPANY.PHASE IIA PHASE IIA INCLUDES PROJECTS THAT WERE EVALUATED UNDER THE CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 12 2010. RGRTA WILL REQUEST PROPOSALS FROM THREE (3) FIRMS UNDER A TASK ORDER CONTRACT TO PERFORM THE DESIGN WORK FOR THIS PHASE OF THE PROJECT. IN ADDITION RGRTA INTENDS TO FUND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS FOR THE FOLLOWING PHASE IIA PROJECTS UNDER THIS GRANT AMENDMENT:1.OPERATIONS BUILDING ROOF REPLACEMENT - AN EXISTING CONDITION SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED FOR THE ROOF SYSTEM ON THE RGRTA OPERATIONS BUILDING AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE EXISTING ROOF SYSTEM WHICH WAS INSTALLED CIRCA 1983 IS IN FAIR TO POOR CONDITION. OBSERVED DETERIORATED AND/OR COMPROMISED ROOFING COMPONENTS INCLUDED; FLASHING SEALANTS GRAVEL AND FLOOD SHEETS. THE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR THIS TYPE OF ROOF SYSTEM IS TYPICALLY 25 TO 30 YEARS. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS ROOF IS APPROACHING OR HAS EXCEEDED ITS USEFUL LIFE EXPECTANCY AND IS DUE FOR REPLACEMENT. IN ADDITION A REPLACEMENT OF THE EXISTING ROOF SYSTEM AFFORDS RGRTA AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ROOF INSULATION THICKNESS AND ENERGY SAVINGS. DUE TO THE AGE AND CONDITION OF THE EXISTING ROOF SYSTEM ON THE OPERATIONS BUILDING RGRTA INTENDS TO REPLACE THE ROOF ABOVE THE MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE BAYS WITH A NEW 0.075 MIL REINFORCED EPDM MEMBRANE ROOF SYSTEM. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE INSTALLATION OF ADDITIONAL ROOF INSULATION FOR AN INCREASED R-VALUE OF THE OVERALL BUILDING ROOF SYSTEM. THE NEW ROOF SYSTEM WILL BE WARRANTED FOR 20 YEARS REQUIRE LESS MAINTENANCE (THAN MAINTAINING THE EXISTING ROOF) AND GUARANTEES THAT ANY EXISTING DAMAGE SUCH AS WATER INFILTRATION BLOCKING OR SUBSTRATE DAMAGE OR MOLD HAS BEEN ELIMINATED OR RECTIFIED. FOR GARAGES B AND C RGRTA INTENDS TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING ROOF AND RESTORE IT. THE EXISTING ROOF IS TO BE BRUSHED OF LOOSE MATERIAL RECOATED AND RE-STONED. THE VERTICAL WALL FLASHINGS IN THE AREA OF THE RESTORATION ARE TO BE REPLACED WITH AN EPDM MEMBRANE MATERIAL. THE RESTORED ROOF CAN BE WARRANTED FOR 10 YEARS; AFTER THE FIRST 10 YEARS AN INSPECTION IS REQUIRED; IF THE RESULTS OF THE INSPECTION INDICATE THE ROOF IS IN SATISFACTORY CONDITION THE ROOF WARRANTY CAN BE EXTENDED 5 YEARS. IF THE ROOF FAILS THE INSPECTION THE NECESSARY CORRECTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE WARRANTY. THE ROOF WARRANTY CAN BE EXTENDED AN ADDITIONAL 5 YEARS IF THE ABOVE PROCEDURE IS FOLLOWED.2.REPLACEMENT OF A/C UNITS FOR THE OPERATIONS BUILDING - A CONDITION SURVEY OF THE EXISTING AIR HANDLING UNITS ON THE ROOF OF THE OPERATIONS BUILDING WAS PERFORMED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TWO EXISTING AIR HANDLING UNITS INSTALLED IN 1976 HAVE REACHED THE END OF THEIR LIFE SPAN AND SHOULD BE REPLACED. THE TYPICAL LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR SIMILAR AIR HANDLING UNITS WITH AIR COOLING AND HEATING CAPABILITY IS NORMALLY 30 TO 35 YEARS. THESE AIR HANDLING UNITS ARE APPROXIMATELY 35 YEARS OLD. REPLACEMENT WILL IMPROVE OPERATING EFFICIENCY REDUCE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AND PROVIDE A MORE RELIABLE HVAC SYSTEM FOR THE OPERATIONS BUILDING. IN ADDITION THE INSTALLATION OF A MODERN COMPUTER-BASED CONTROL SYSTEM WILL FURTHER ENHANCE EFFICIENCY AND PROVIDE VALUABLE OPERATING DATA. RGRTA ANTICIPATES THAT THIS WORK WILL BE PERFORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OPERATIONS BUILDING ROOF REPLACEMENT.3.OPERATIONS BUILDING FIRE ALARM SYSTEM REPLACEMENT - THE EXISTING FIRE ALARM SYSTEM IN THE OPERATIONS BUILDING IS ANTIQUATED AND AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE. FREQUENT REPAIRS ARE NECESSARY AND PARTS ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. RGRTA INTENDS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WITH A NEW ADDRESSABLE SYSTEM.A NEW FIRE ALARM PANEL WILL BE INSTALLED ADJACENT TO THE EXISTING AND BROUGHT ONLINE. EACH AREA OF THE BUILDING CAN THEN BE REWORKED INDIVIDUALLY. AN AREA CAN BE DISCONNECTED FROM THE EXISTING PANEL AND THE EXISTING CONDUIT SYSTEM CAN BE USED TO INSTALL THE NEW DEVICES. ANY NEW CONDUITS OR DEVICES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED CAN ALSO BE INSTALLED AT THAT TIME. UPON COMPLETION OF THAT AREA THE NEW DEVICES CAN BE BOUGHT ONLINE. BOTH THE EXISTING AND NEW FACP PANELS WILL OPERATE SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE NEW PANEL PROVIDING ANY REPORTING OF ALARMS THAT WILL OCCUR. UPON COMPLETION OF THE NEW WORK THE EXISTING PANEL CAN BE DECOMMISSIONED.RGRTA ANTICIPATES THAT THE NEW FIRE ALARM SYSTEM WILL HAVE A USEFUL LIFE OF 15 20 YEARS.4.REMOVE THE TRAINING CENTER TRAILER FUNCTIONS PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED IN THE TRAINING CENTER TRAILER WILL BE MOVED TO THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING AS PART OF PHASE I OF THE CAMPUS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT. BECAUSE OF THIS RELOCATION RGRTA HAS DETERMINED THAT THE EXISTING TRAINING CENTER TRAILER IS NO LONGER NEEDED AND CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE SITE ENTIRELY. THE TRAINING CENTER TRAILER HAS EXCEEDED ITS USEFUL LIFE. NO FEDERAL FUNDS WERE USED IN THE PURCHASE OF THE TRAINING CENTER TRAILER. RGRTA WILL ATTEMPT TO COMPETITIVELY SELL THE ASSET. HAVING THE TRAILER REMOVED WILL ALLOW RGRTA TO MORE EFFECTIVELY USE THE LIMITED SPACE ON ITS MAIN STREET CAMPUS. THIS PORTION OF THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE THE REMOVAL AND OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF THE TRAILER THE DISCONNECTION AND TERMINATION OF UTILITIES AND THE RESTORATION OF THE SITE FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.5.INSTALL ONE (1) PROTECTED 12000 GALLON DIESEL ABOVE GROUND STORAGE TANK - THIS PORTION OF THE PROJECT INVOLVES THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW 12000 GALLON DIESEL FUEL ABOVE- GROUND STORAGE TANK (AST) ADJACENT TO THE EXISTING SERVICE BUILDING. THE NEW TANK WOULD BE CONNECTED THROUGH EXISTING FUEL SUPPLY PIPING AS BACKUP TO THE EXISTING THREE UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS (UST). THIS WILL BE THE FIRST STEP IN THE PHASED TRANSITION FROM THE PRESENT USE OF UNDERGROUND TANKS FOR FUEL STORAGE TO THE FUTURE GOAL OF USING ONLY ABOVE-GROUND TANKS.THREE 10000-GALLON UNDERGROUND DIESEL OIL STORAGE TANKS ARE LOCATED AT THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF RGRTAS SERVICE BUILDING. THE CONTINUED MAINTENANCE OF THESE TANKS IS PROBLEMATIC DUE TO THEIR AGE AND THE ADDED COMPLIANCE REQUIRED FOR THE SINGLE WALL TANKS.THE TANKS REPRESENT AN ONGOING POTENTIAL LIABILITY BECAUSE A LEAK IN THE TANK WALL WOULD NOT BE CONTAINED AND COULD RESULT IN CONTAMINATION OF THE SURROUNDING SOIL AND SUBSTANTIAL CLEANUP COSTS FOR RGRTA. THE PRESENT TANK SYSTEM IN WHICH ALL THREE TANKS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER WITH A COMMON MANIFOLD ALSO LEAVES RGRTA VULNERABLE TO SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS DUE TO FAILURE OF A SINGLE PUMP. SERVICE COULD ALSO BE INTERRUPTED IF A TANK OR PIPING FAILURE OCCURRED.RGRTA ANTICIPATES THAT THE NEW AST WILL HAVE A USEFUL LIFE OF 25-30 YEARS.6.COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT RGRTAS COMMUNICATIONS TOWER IS CURRENTLY LOCATED ON THE ROOF OF THE OPERATIONS BUILDING. A RECENT INVESTIGATION OF THE TOWER HAS FOUND IT TO BE STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND. MONROE COUNTY HAS ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH RGRTA TO CONSTRUCT A NEW COMMUNICATIONS TOWER ON VACANT LAND WITHIN THE RGRTA EAST MAIN STREET CAMPUS PROPERTY. THE TOWER WOULD SERVE MONROE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY AND RGRTAS COMMUNICATION NEEDS. MONROE COUNTY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TOWER. RGRTA WILL INCUR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RELOCATING THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT TO THIS NEW TOWER.PHASE IIB III1.PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW RGRTA INTENDS TO UTILIZE FUNDS UNDER THIS GRANT AMENDMENT TO PROCURE SERVICES NEEDED FOR PRELIMINARY DESIGN AND THE COMPLETION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR THE PROJECTS TO BE INCLUDED IN PHASE IIB AND PHASE III. ONCE THIS DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WORK IS COMPLETED RGRTA WILL ENTER A FINAL GRANT AMENDMENT FOR THE REMAINING $6957084 ($8696355 MATCHED) STATE OF GOOD REPAIR FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT THE PROJECTS INCLUDED IN PHASE IIB. THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE SITE IMPROVEMENTS AN ADDITION TO THE PERIMETER WALL THE PURCHASE AND REMEDIATION OF TWENTY-ONE (21) PROPERTIES ON CHAMBERLAIN HAYWARD STREETS CONSTRUCTION OF EMPLOYEE PARKING AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE FACILITY.PROJECT BUDGET IN MATCHED DOLLARSADDITION TO PHASE INETWORK EQUIPMENT - $160000UPGRADE NETWORK EQUIPMENT - $66765SOIL REMEDIATION - $132000TOTAL - $358765PHASE IIAOPERATIONS BUILDING ROOF REPLACEMENT - $2257200REPLACE A/C UNITS OF OPERATIONS BUILDING - $91212REPLACE OPERATIONS BUILDING FIRE ALARM SYSTEM - $202542REMOVAL OF TRAINING CENTER TRAILER - $8133INSTALL DIESEL AST - $180510COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT - $24617CONSTRUCTION CONTINGENCY - $150382ESCALATION - $82916DESIGN ENGINEERING - $194178RGRTA PM - $74938SOFT COST CONTINGENCY - $22448CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT FEES - $119900CONSTRUCTION MONITORING / SPECIAL INSPECTIONS - $59950TOTAL - $3468926PHASE IIBDESIGN ENGINEERING - $200000PR / COMMUNICATIONS - $20000APPRAISAL - $126000TITLE INSURANCE - $100000LEGAL LAND ACQUISITION - $40000LEGAL ENVIRONMENTAL - $70000ENVIRONMENTAL - $70000TOTAL - $626000MAINTENANCE PLAN ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE CAMPUS IMPROVEMENT PLAN WILL BE ADDED TO RGRTAS ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ASSETWORKS ONCE COMPLETED.

HASTUS PROJECTIN 2011 THE MBTA WAS AWARDED $1.4M IN FUNDING FOR ITS DAILY OPERATIONS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (GRANT - MA-90-X590-00) TO IMPROVE THE PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF BUS TRANSPORT-RELATED OPERATIONS BY AUTOMATING THE CURRENT SYSTEM. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO EFFICIENTLY OPERATE DORM AN UPGRADE TO THE EXISTING HASTUS PLATFORM FROM VERSION 2009 TO 2013 IS REQUIRED. THIS UPGRADE TO THE EXISTING HASTUS SOFTWARE WAS NOT FEASIBLE UNTIL THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DAILY OPERATIONS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT WAS EXECUTED. BOTH HASTUS AND DORM PROVIDES A CUSTOM DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED PROGRAM AS PART OF THE OPERATIONS TECHNOLOGY DIVISIONS LONG TERM GOALS OF IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY AND EFFICIENCY. THIS OVERALL PROGRAM HAS HELPED IMPROVE THE DAILY PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF BUS TRANSPORT-RELATED OPERATIONS BY AUTOMATING THE CURRENT SYSTEM. ADDRESSING HASTUS SPECIFICALLY THIS UPGRADE WILL PROVIDE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN ITD AND OPERATIONS TO REPLACE THE OBSOLETE MAINFRAME PICK AND TKS SYSTEMS WHICH WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS GOING FORWARD. THIS UPGRADE TO HASTUS WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED IN ORDER TO FULLY COMPLETE THE UPGRADE FOR DORM. THE UPGRADE PORTION OF THIS PROPOSAL CALLS FOR THE MBTA TO PURCHASE THE SOFTWARE LICENSES AND RELATED IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES (DATABASE MIGRATION TESTING CONFIGURATION TRAINING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT). TO ACCOMPLISH THIS UPGRADE FROM HASTUS 2009 TO HASTUS 2013 THE MBTA WILL BE WORKING WITH GIRO INC. THE DEVELOPER AND SOLE VENDOR OF HASTUS. THERE ARE COMPETING PRODUCTS TO HASTUS BUT THE MBTA HAS ALREADY A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN HASTUS. CONSIDERING A CHANGE WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SCHEDULING SOFTWARE USED AT THE MBTA AND WOULD BE A COST PROHIBITIVE PROPOSITION. AS A RESULT THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT CANNOT FULLY PROCEED WITHOUT THIS UPGRADE. SPECIFICALLY THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT PROVIDED ENOUGH FUNDING THE MODULE TO RUN; HOWEVER OUR CURRENT SOFTWARE NEEDED TO RUN THIS MODULE IS INCOMPATIBLE; THEREFORE THIS SYSTEMS UPGRADE IS NECESSARY TO RUN THIS NEW MODULE. AS A RESULT THIS UPGRADE WILL PROVIDE A POTENTIAL LIFECYCLE OF 20 YEARS.PROJECT BUDGET AND STATUS:THIS PROJECT IS FULLY FUNDED WITHIN THIS GRANT AT $500000.AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS GRANT THE UPGRADE IS UNDERWAY (5% COMPLETED) AND THE ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE IS 11/1/20137. ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:THE ENTERPRISE ASSET MANAGEMENT (EAM) SYSTEM FOR THE ENGINEERING AND MAINTENANCE DIVISION WILL ALLOW WHOLE-LIFE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF THE PHYSICAL ASSETS OF THE MBTA TO MAXIMIZE VALUE. INITIAL FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT WAS SET UP THROUGH GRANT NUMBER MA-90-X590 UNDER THE ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS PROJECT TOTALING $490878 AND THIS GRANT WILL COMPLETE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT. THE TOTAL COST OF THIS PROJECT IS $1.1M. THIS EAM SYSTEM COVERS DESIGN CONSTRUCTION COMMISSIONING OPERATIONS MAINTENANCE AND DECOMMISSIONING/REPLACEMENT OF PLANT EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES. ENTERPRISE REFERS TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ASSETS ACROSS DEPARTMENTS LOCATIONS FACILITIES AND IN SOME CASES BUSINESS UNITS. BY MANAGING ASSETS IN THIS WAY ORGANIZATIONS CAN IMPROVE UTILIZATION AND PERFORMANCE REDUCE CAPITAL COSTS REDUCE ASSET-RELATED OPERATING COSTS EXTEND ASSET LIFE AND SUBSEQUENTLY IMPROVE ROA (RETURN ON ASSETS).AS ORGANIZATIONS MOVE FROM HISTORICAL AND REACTIVE (RUN-TO-FAILURE) MODELS AND BEGIN TO EMBRACE WHOLE LIFE PLANNING LIFE-CYCLE COSTING PLANNED AND PROACTIVE MAINTENANCE AND OTHER INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES ASSET MANAGEMENT IS A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT. COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FORCE ORGANIZATIONS TO MINIMIZE THE TOTAL COST OF ASSET OWNERSHIP AND STREAMLINE ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS (THESE TYPICALLY INVOLVE MYRIAD ACTIVITIES RANGING FROM INVENTORY PARTS AND LABOR MANAGEMENT TO CONTRACTS AND VENDOR MANAGEMENT FOR NEW WORKS). AS DOWNTIMES BECOME INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE BOTH IN TERMS OF LOST PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND UNFAVORABLE PUBLICITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE COMPELLED TO MAXIMIZE THEIR ASSET PRODUCTIVE LIFE CYCLES VIA OPTIMAL MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS.IN THE EVENT OF ASSET FAILURE QUICK RESPONSE TIME IS CRITICAL. IN RECENT YEARS STRINGENT INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY REGULATIONS ARE BEING ENFORCED BY GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT AGENCIES WITH INDUSTRIAL OWNERS AND OPERATORS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE. ASSET REGISTERS RISK REGISTERS WORK PLANNING AND SCHEDULING LIFE-CYCLE COSTING AND SYSTEMATIC METHODS FOR PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ARE INCREASINGLY SEEN AS PREREQUISITES FOR A ROBUST ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.BY PROVIDING A PLATFORM FOR CONNECTING PEOPLE PROCESSES ASSETS INDUSTRY-BASED KNOWLEDGE AND DECISION SUPPORT CAPABILITIES BASED ON QUALITY INFORMATION EAM PROVIDES A HOLISTIC VIEW OF AN ORGANIZATIONS ASSET BASE ENABLING MANAGERS TO CONTROL AND OPTIMIZE THEIR OPERATIONS FOR QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY. EAM SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN NOT INTEGRATED WITH THE REST OF THE COMPANYS ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS (INCLUDING PURCHASING HR INVENTORY ETC.) WHICH INCREASES MANAGEMENT OVERHEAD AND PREVENTS THE ORGANIZATION FROM REALIZING THE SYSTEMS FULL POTENTIAL. THE PROCUREMENT OF THE ENGINEERING AND MAINTENANCE DIVISIONS EAM PLANS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES INCLUDING INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MBTA SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ITD ORACLE BACKEND DATABASE PEOPLESOFT FINANCIAL AND MATERIALS INFORMATION SYSTEM THE CAPITAL ASSETS DATABASE HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND PARTICULARLY THE MBTA STATE OF GOOD REPAIR DATABASE AND THE TRANSIT ASSET MANAGEMENT PROJECT WHERE DATA FROM THE EAM WILL BE USED TO UPDATE THE DATABASES WITH ACTUAL COST AND CONDITION DATA. DATA FROM THE EAM SYSTEM WILL ASSIST IN THE MANAGEMENT AND AUDITING OF THE ENGINEERING AND MAINTENANCE DIVISION BY FTA AND MBTA. DATA FROM THE SYSTEM WILL ALSO HELP TO SUPPORT OPERATIONAL FUNDING REQUESTS FOR BOTH DAY-TO-DAY MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS LARGE SCALE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROJECTS.FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS GRANT THE SCOPE CONSISTS OF HARDWARE INSTALLATION DATA CONFIGURATION AND MIGRATION SYSTEM TESTING TRAINING OF PERSONNEL AND DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES. THIS GRANT WILL NOT FUND THE PROCUREMENT OF THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE INITIAL DATA COLLECTION AND CREATION OF DESIGN TEMPLATES. AN ADDITIONAL AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE A LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO REAL TRANSPORTATION ASSET MANAGEMENT ISSUES. PROJECT BUDGET AND STATUS:PROJECT IS FULLY FUNDED WITH THIS GRANT ($700000) AND GRANT # MA-05-X590 ($490878). TOTAL PROJECT COST IS APPROXIMATELY $1.19M.

IN AMES IOWA. CYRIDE BELIEVES IT IS IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD IN SECURING THE SAFETEA-LU FUNDING AT THIS TIME WITHIN AN APPROVED GRANT ELSE THE FUNDS WILL LAPSE AFTER SEPTEMBER 30 2010. CYRIDE IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING FINAL AE WORK AT OUR CURRENT SITE AND THE FOLLOWING EARMARK OF $434720 WOULD SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING REMAINING FEDERAL FUNDS OF 234445 FOR THIS WORK. THE FY2008 EARMARK IS LISTED AS FOLLOWS: IA-E2008-BUSP-0235; PROJECT NUMBER 440; TITLED - AMES IOWA-EXPANSION OF CYRIDE BUS MAINTENANCE FACILITY FOR $434720.CYRIDE HAS MORE THAN MAXIMIZED ITS EXISTING STORAGE SPACE AT CYRIDE AND IS CURRENTLY PARKING 5 BUSES OUTSIDE. (SEE FACILITY EXPANSION REPORT PAGE 24 25) IN ADDITION CYRIDE WILL RECEIVE 7 EXPANSION BUSES IN JULY 2010 TO ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THE RIDERSHIP GROWTH THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST DECADE. CYRIDE STAFF ESTIMATES THEY WILL TRANSPORT OVER 5.3 MILLION RIDERS FOR FY2010 INCREASING PASSENGERS BY 75% FROM 2001 (3.04 MILLION) WHEN CYRIDE WENT FARE FREE TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. TO ACCOMMODATE THIS GROWTH CYRIDE HAS ADDED 12 BUSES TO THE PEAK HOUR REQUIREMENT FOR ITS PULL OUT SINCE 2006 CURRENTLY PULLING OUT 57 VEHICLES AND EXPECTS 3 MORE AT A MINIMUM TO THIS TOTAL FOR THE FALL 2010! CYRIDE ALSO SUBCONTRACTS WITH DURHAM SCHOOL INC. (PRIVATE SCHOOL OPERATOR) TO PROVIDE 7 TRIPS CALLED EXTRAS AFTER THEY DROP OFF MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE MORNING ELSE CYRIDES PEAK REQUIREMENT FOR BUSES WOULD BE EVEN HIGHER. EXTRA BUSES HELP OUT THE MAIN BUS ASSIGNED TO A TRIP FOR CYRIDE AND ON SOME ROUTES CYRIDE HAS UP TO 5 EXTRA BUSES HELPING OUT ON SOME TRIPS! DURHAM HAS NOTIFIED CYRIDE THAT THEY CANNOT ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL TRIPS IN 2010 (7 IS THE MAXIMUM) AND THEREFORE ANY FUTURE PEAK LOAD GROWTH WILL NEED TO BE ABSORBED BY CYRIDE. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS CYRIDE HAS CONDUCTED SEVERAL ANALYSES FROM EXPANDING THE CURRENT SITE TO POSSIBLY CONSTRUCTING OFF-SITE REVIEWING APPROXIMATELY 12 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS (SITES A J CIT AND WYLIE). THE ATTACHED FACILITY EXPANSION REPORT SUMMARIZES THE STEPS STAFF HAS TAKEN OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS IN HOW CYRIDE SHOULD GROW - FROM THE INITIAL NEEDS ANALYSIS THE VARIOUS STUDIES SEVERAL SATELLITE SITE REVIEWS AND DESIGN ALTERNATIVES. THE BOARDS DESIRE IS FOR CYRIDE TO MAXIMIZE ITS CURRENT SITE. THEREFORE ATTACHED IS A PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF THE BEST OPTION THUS FAR TO MAXIMIZE THE CURRENT SITE ENTITLED D1A WHICH PARSONS BRINKERHOFF (PB) COMPLETED THROUGH THEIR PREVIOUS DESIGN WORK IN 2008. THIS OPTION BRINGS THE SHOP FUNCTION TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE FACILITY ALLOWING MAINTENANCE OF VEHICLES TO CONTINUE IN THE EVENING HOURS ESTABLISHES CIRCULATION LANES (BRIGHT PINK) AND INCORPORATES 10 ADDITIONAL SPACES FOR BUS PARKING. CYRIDE RECENTLY HIRED A DIFFERENT CONSULTANT FOR A FRESH VIEW IN FURTHER REFINING THIS DIRECTION AS WELL AS VALIDATING THE COST ESTIMATES BY THE END OF JUNE 2010. ALTHOUGH THIS D1A DESIGN OPTION DOES NOT ALLOW 100% OF THE NEEDS AS DETERMINED BY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BY 2030 CYRIDES BOARD CHALLENGED STAFF TO DESIGN LESS THAN INDUSTRY STANDARD BUT MEET OUR NEEDS TO ACCOMMODATE STORAGE/SHOP EXPANSION ON THE CURRENT SITE BY 2030. IF GROWTH NEEDS COULD NOT BE ACCOMMODATED ON THE CURRENT SITE THE BOARD WANTED THE CONSULTANT TO REVIEW THE SITE TO THE SOUTH OF CYRIDE THE ISU SOCCER FIELDS AS ANOTHER POTENTIAL SITE FOR EXPANSION (SITE #13!). HOWEVER THIS SITE IS IN A FLOOD PLAIN (AS WAS CYRIDES CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE FACILITY) AND WOULD NEED TO UNDERGO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION. CYRIDE PLANS TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY INTO FINAL DESIGN/CONSTRUCTION OF THIS EXPANSION OPTION THEREAFTER TO GET OUR BUSES BACK INTO A STORAGE BARN. WITH OUTSIDE PARKING NOW A REALITY EXPEDITING SOME STORAGE CONSTRUCTION ON THE CURRENT SITE IS A PRIORITY FOR CYRIDE. ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT INCLUDE REMAINING 5309 FUNDS ALREADY APPROVED IN IA-03-0111 OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION AND TWO OTHER EARMARKS YET TO BE REQUESTED AND ARE DEFINED BELOW: IA-E2009-BUSP-0318; PROJECT NUMBER 440; TITLED - AMES IOWA-EXPANSION OF CYRIDE BUS MAINTENANCE FACILITY FOR $451440. IA-E2010-BUSP-068; PROJECT NUMBER 440; TITLED - AMES IOWA-EXPANSION OF CYRIDE BUS MAINTENANCE FACILITY FOR $750000.CYRIDE WILL WAIT TO INCORPORATE THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS INTO IA-04-0111 WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY LINE ITEM WHEN THE FINAL DESIGN HAS BEEN COMPLETED AT THE END OF SUMMER 2010. UPDATED ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTED CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION WAS UPDATED WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PORTION OF THE MAINTENANCE FACILITY WAS CONSTRUCTED IN MAY 2005 HOWEVER STAFF WILL BE INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE SOCCER FIELD SITE DIRECTLY SOUTH OF CYRIDE IS AN OPTION FOR CONTINUED GROWTH BUT AT THIS TIME ANTICIPATES GROWTH/CONSTRUCTION ON THE EXISTING SITE AS WELL. THE PREVIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IS ATTACHED TO THIS GRANT. ONCE THE FINAL DESIGN IS COMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK WOULD BE SUBMITTED IF SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES OCCUR. SEE BELOW FOR DETAILED PROJECT INFORMATION.B) URBANIZED AREA: AMES IOWA C) TYPE OF SERVICE AND PROVIDER: AMES TRANSIT AGENCY (CYRIDE) A DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY OF AMES IOWA PROVIDES THE MAJORITY OF THE FIXED-ROUTE SERVICE.

AMES IA 50010F) FACILITY PURPOSE: THIS ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING WORK WILL BE TO DESIGN ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE BAYS (BRINGING THIS FUNCTION OUT OF THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE FACILITY) AND ALSO FOR ADDITIONAL STORAGE (AKA BUS PARKING) TO SUPPORT AN ANTICIPATED FLEET OF 85 BUSES BY 2030. AN ADDITIONAL NEED IS TO COMPLETE NEPA DOCUMENTATION FOR THE PREFERRED DESIGN OPTION. CYRIDE HAS HIRED A CONSULTANT TO REFINE THE REDESIGN OF THE FACILITY TO MAXIMIZE THE SPACE ON THE EXISTING PROPERTY AND DEVELOP DESIGN OPTIONS FOR THE FACILITY THAT MEET CYRIDES NEEDS INTO 2030. ONE GOAL IS TO MOVE CYRIDES MAINTENANCE FACILITY TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE FACILITY THEREBY ALLOWING CONTINUATION OF MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS PAST 5PM. CURRENTLY MAINTENANCE IS BLOCKED WITHIN THE BUILDING WHEN PEAK SERVICE IS COMPLETED AND BUSES ARE PARKED FOR THE EVENING MAKING CIRCULATION OF THE BUSES IMPOSSIBLE THEREBY MAKING WORK CEASE IN THE SHOP EVEN THROUGH OPERATING SERVICE CONTINUES UNTIL MIDNIGHT EVERY NIGHT AND UNTIL 3AM ON FRIDAY/SATURDAY EVENINGS. IN ADDITION MORE MAINTENANCE BAYS ARE NEEDED AS WELL TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH OF VEHICLES NEEDING TO BE MAINTAINED. CURRENTLY ONLY 4 BAYS EXIST WITHIN ITS GARAGE WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO SERVE 15 BUSES/BAY OR 60 LARGE BUSES. CYRIDE CURRENTLY HAS 59 LARGE 40-FOOT BUSES WITHIN THEIR FLEET AND ANTICIPATES GROWING TO NEARLY 100 BUSES BY 2030. THEREFORE ADDITIONAL BAYS ARE NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE WORK LOAD SUCH AS PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE BODY WORK AND PAINTING IN ORDER TO MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENT IN KEEPING VEHICLES IN A STATE OF GOOD REPAIR. THE BODY WORK AND PAINTING MAINTENANCE IN-HOUSE FUNCTIONS ARE WHAT MAKE CYRIDE A POSITIVE IMAGE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.

THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE BUILDING PROJECT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SINCE MAY 2000 USING GRANT IA-03-0088.THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT IS CONTINUATION OF THE SCOPE DESCRIBED IN IA-03-0088-05.PROJECT JUSTIFICATIONTHE AMES TRANSIT AGENCY WAS CREATED IN 1981 AS AN AGENCY OF THE CITY OF AMES WITH THE PURPOSE OF UNDERTAKING THE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF TRANSIT SERVICES IN AMES. IN 1982 AN UMTA SECTION 3 GRANT WAS SECURED TO CONSTRUCT A 22-BUS MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE FACILITY. IN 1989 ANOTHER UMTA SECTION 3 GRANT WAS SECURED TO EXPAND THE FACILITY TO ACCOMMODATE THE MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE OF 38 BUSES. CURRENTLY THE TRANSIT AGENCY OWNS 40 LARGE BUSES; NINE SMALL BUSES; AND THREE SUPPORT VEHICLES.THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS IN THIS GRANT APPLICATION. ONE PART OF THE PROJECT IS TO EXPAND CURRENT VEHICLE STORAGE MAINTENANCE AND OFFICE FACILITIES TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH THAT CYRIDE HAS EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND TO PREPARE FOR CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE FUTURE. THE OTHER PART IS TO REHABILITATE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE CURRENT BUILDING THAT NEED EXTENSIVE REPAIR.REHABILITATIONWHEN THE ORIGINAL BUILDING WAS CONSTRUCTED IN 1983-84 THE ARCHITECT CHOSE SEVERAL DESIGN ELEMENTS THAT WOULD PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. ONE OF THE DESIGN ELEMENTS WAS A SOLAR COLLECTOR ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE BUILDING. THIS WALL HAS PROVEN TO BE A MAINTENANCE HEADACHE AND IT DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OR COSTS. AN ENGINEERING STUDY SEVERAL YEARS AGO INDICATED THAT THE WALL WAS SAVING THE TRANSIT AGENCY LESS THAN $100 PER YEAR IN ENERGY COSTS. THE SEALS AROUND THE GLASS PANELS HAVE FAILED AND THE WALL IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING.ANOTHER DESIGN ELEMENT THAT HAS NOT MET ITS PROMISED VALUE IS THE USE OF A WALL SYSTEM CONSISTING OF STYROFOAM PANELS WITH A STUCCO SURFACE. THE EXTERIOR INSULATION AND FINISHING SYSTEM (EIFS) WAS A STATE OF THE ART APPROACH TO CONSTRUCTION IN 1983. THE LIGHTWEIGHT MATERIAL WAS PROMISED TO REDUCE CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND ENERGY COSTS. THE LIGHTWEIGHT MATERIAL ALLOWED THE BUILDING FOOTINGS AND SUPPORT WALLS TO BE MUCH THINNER THAN ORDINARY BRICK OR STONE MATERIAL WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THUS SAVING SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION. THE LOWER CONSTRUCTION COST ALLOWED CYRIDE TO AMEND THE ORIGINAL GRANT AND PURCHASE TWO NEW BUSES.THE EXTERIOR WALL MATERIAL HAS ENABLED TO CYRIDE TO OPERATE THE BUILDING WITH LOW ENERGY COSTS. THE STRONG INSULATING QUALITIES OF THE MATERIAL ARE READILY APPARENT. HOWEVER THE PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIAL WERE RELATIVELY UNKNOWN IN 1983 AND THE ATTACHMENT OF THE MATERIAL TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUILDING HAS PROVEN TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM.THE NATURE OF THE EIFS MATERIAL IS THAT IT HAS ALMOST NO EXPANSION OR CONTRACTION. UNFORTUNATELY THE STEEL STRUCTURE OF THE BUILDING EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS WITH CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE. EXPANSION JOINTS WERE NOT DESIGNED INTO THE ORIGINAL BUILDING. AFTER THE MATERIAL CRACKED IN SEVERAL PLACES REMEDIAL EXPANSION JOINTS WERE INSTALLED. IT IS NOW NECESSARY TO REPAIR THOSE JOINTS TO PROPERLY ACCOMMODATE THE EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF THE BUILDING. THE CRACKING OF THE MATERIAL AT FLASHINGS JOINTS AND WALL OPENINGS HAS ALLOWED WATER TO ENTER BEHIND THE INSULATING MATERIAL. CYRIDE HAS CAULKED AND SEALED THE ENTRY POINTS FOR WATER BUT A MORE THOROUGH TYPE OF REPAIR IS NEEDED. THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THE EXTERIOR STUCCO TYPE MATERIAL WAS UNKNOWN AT THE TIME. COMPARISON TO NORMAL STUCCO FINISHES WAS THE EXPECTATION. HOWEVER THE THICKNESS OF THE EXTERIOR COAT WAS SUCH THAT THE FIBERGLASS WIRE MESH BECAME EXPOSED AFTER SEVERAL YEARS. CYRIDE HAS REPAIRED MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS AND HAS REPAINTED THE BUILDING. MORE EXTENSIVE REPAIRS ARE NEEDED FOR THE LONG-TERM PERMANENCE OF THE BUILDING.A STUDY IN JANUARY 1999 EXAMINED ALTERNATIVES FOR THE BUILDING EXTERIOR INCLUDING REPLACING THE EIFS SYSTEM WITH A METAL SKIN OR BRICK. THE TRANSIT BOARD CHOSE TO RETAIN THE EIFS SYSTEM AND REPAIR IT.REHABILITATION OF SOME COMPONENTS OF THE MAINTENANCE AREA IS ALSO NEEDED. A NEW BUS WASHER TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL IS A HIGH PRIORITY. PARTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FOR THE 1983 MODEL BUS WASHER. THE REPLACEMENT OF THE HYDRAULIC HOISTS WITH ELECTRIC HOISTS IS ALSO NECESSARY.IN THE 1988 EXPANSION THE NEW BUILDING SURROUNDED THE LIQUIDS STORAGE ROOM. MOVING THIS ROOM WITH ITS HAZARDOUS AND POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS TO A NEW STORAGE AREA WITH AN EXTERIOR WALL IS IMPORTANT FOR THE SAFETY OF BUILDING OCCUPANTS AS WELL AS THE MINIMIZATION OF DAMAGE IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT IN THIS AREA.EXPANSION WHILE THE REHABILITATION OF THE CURRENT FACILITY IS IMPORTANT EXPANSION IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE BUS SYSTEM. AT THE COMPLETION OF THE LAST BUILDING EXPANSION CYRIDE RIDERSHIP FOR FY 91 WAS 2367174. FOR FY 99 CYRIDE CARRIED 2876803 PASSENGERS AND WILL PROBABLY MOVE 3000000 PASSENGERS THIS YEAR.THE CITY OF AMES TRANSPORTATION PLAN IS IN ITS FINAL DRAFT AND WILL PROBABLY BE APPROVED BY THE AMES CITY COUNCIL THIS YEAR. THE PLAN CALLS FOR CONTINUED EXPANSION OF BUS SERVICE TO THE GROWTH AREAS OF AMES. IT ALSO PRESENTS AN OPTION FOR IMPROVED FREQUENCIES ON EXISTING ROUTES. EACH OF THESE STRATEGIES WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE CAPABILITIES AND OFFICE SPACE.AS THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES INCREASED THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES HAS ALSO INCREASED. THE NUMBER OF MECHANICS HAS INCREASED FROM SIX TO EIGHT AND MORE SPACE IS NEEDED FOR NORMAL MAINTENANCE. THE NUMBER OF FULL AND PART TIME DRIVERS HAS INCREASED AND THE COMMON AREAS IN THE OFFICE ARE INADEQUATE FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO USE THEM.AN ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT WAS HIRED IN 1994 AND A NEW OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR WILL BE HIRED IN THE SUMMER OF 2000. ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE IS NEEDED FOR THESE PEOPLE. FUTURE GROWTH MAY ALSO NECESSITATE THE ADDITION OF A FULL OR PART TIME TRANSIT PLANNER WHICH WILL ALSO REQUIRE MORE OFFICE SPACE.THE CURRENT CONFERENCE ROOM IS TOO SMALL FOR MANY OF THE TRAINING AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "9ddbc200-92e5-9757-56b5-ae9c4bb3fa0c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_IA-04-0111_6955"}, {"internal_id": 148484571, "Award ID": "IA-03-0111", "Award Amount": 0.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-05-11", "CFDA Number": "20.500", "Description": "REVISION: DEEMBER 13 2019CYRIDE INTENDS TO PURCHASE A PARTIAL ARTICULATED BUS IN 2020 THAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE DELIVERED BY OCTOBER 31 2022.

AMES TRANSIT AGENCY (CYRIDE) WILL PROVIDE THE LOCAL MATCH OF $450000. THIS FUNDING WAS AWARDED THROUGH SECTION 5309 DISCRETIONARY BUS AND BUS FACILITIES SOLICITATION OF PROJECT PROPOSALS IN SUPPORT OF FTAS LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVE. THIS INITIATIVE SUPPORTS TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONNECTING DISADVANTAGED AND LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS TO JOBS AND/OR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP ACHIEVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. SPECIFICALLY THIS GRANT WILL HELP CYRIDE OFFER BETTER ACCESS FOR LOW-INCOME AND STUDENT POPULATIONS ON TWO OF ITS BUSIEST ROUTES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS UNPRECEDENTED RIDERSHIP GROWTH (15%) OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. THESE ROUTES SERVED WITH ARTICULATED BUSES WILL CONNECT WITH IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY ONE OF THE FINEST HIGHER-LEVEL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE NATION.ACCORDING TO THE TRANSIT FEASIBILITY STUDY CYRIDE HAD CONDUCTED IN 2009 THE CONSULTANT RECOMMENDED CYRIDE OPERATE ARTICULATED BUSES ON BOTH ITS #23 ORANGE AND #1 RED ROUTES. THIS STUDY STATED THAT TWO 60-FOOT ARTICULATED BUSES WOULD PROVIDE MORE CAPACITY THAN THREE 40-FOOT BUSES. SPECIFICALLY THE FOUR 60 ARTICULATED BUS FLEET IN THIS GRANT WOULD PROVIDE CAPACITY OF 440 PASSENGERS PER TRIP (4 X 110 PASSENGERS) WHILE THE SIX 40 BUSES WOULD PROVIDE 360 PASSENGERS (6 X 60 PASSENGERS). WITH THIS EXTRA CAPACITY AMES TRANSIT AGENCY (CYRIDE) LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVE 14 ADDITIONAL PASSENGERS PER BUS PER TRIP CAN BE ACCOMMODATED. THEREFORE WITH ARTICULATED BUSES CYRIDE COULD PROVIDE SERVICE FOR ANOTHER 475200 PASSENGERS ANNUALLY; THEREBY ENHANCING THEIR ACCESS TO WORK AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AT IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY.THESE VEHICLES WILL PROVIDE CYRIDE THE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY NEEDED ALONG THE S. 16TH ST.

THIS FACILITY WILL SERVE AS THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION HUB AND GATEWAY TO NORTHEAST FLORIDA AND PROVIDES A CATALYST FOR FURTHER JOB CREATION AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND LIVABILITY.THE RAIL PORTION OF THE JRTC INCLUDES THE RELOCATION OF THE AMTRAK STATION AND PREPARATION FOR COMMUTER RAIL. THE EXISTING AMTRAK TERMINAL LOCATION WHICH IS LOCATED FIVE MILES FROM THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT AREA DOES NOT FACILITATE THE TRANSFER TO OTHER LOCAL AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION MODES. RELOCATION OF AMTRAKS OPERATIONS TO THE JRTC SITE PROVIDES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE PASSENGER TRANSFERS AND INCREASED ACCESS TO AMENITIES SUCH AS SECURED PARKING. JACKSONVILLE IS ALSO PART OF THE NATIONAL HIGH SPEED RAIL (HSR) SYSTEM AND THIS RELOCATION TAKES ADVANTAGE OF BOTH EXISTING RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE HISTORIC RAIL TERMINAL. COINCIDING WITH THIS PHASE IS THE PURCHASE OF MINOR ADDITIONAL RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE THE FULL RELOCATION OF AMTRAK FACILITIES. WORK CONTINUES TO BE COORDINATED WITH THE PRIVATE RAILROADS ON RELOCATING EXISTING TRACKS. AN EA HAS FEDERAL AND SHPO APPROVAL DESIGN IS NEAR THE 60% LEVEL FOR TRACKWORK. THE FTA CURRENTLY HAS APPROVED THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (EA) FOR THIS INTERMODAL CENTER PROJECT ON 01/15/2009 AND THIS DOCUMENT COVERS BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING THAT IS TO BE LOCATED WITHIN THE INTERMODAL CENTER AS WELL AS THE COMPLETE INTERMODAL CENTER.
