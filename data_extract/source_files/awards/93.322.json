THESE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE TO BRIDGE, TRAIN, AND SUSTAIN THE LABORATORY PROFESSIONALS SO THEY ARE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE NEXT LARGE SCALE PANDEMIC OR NATURAL DISASTER. CLINICAL LABORATORY PROFESSIONALS AND PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY PROFESSIONALS ARE THE TWO MAIN GROUPS THAT ARE TARGETED TO BE \"BRIDGED\" OR CROSS-TRAINED IN EACH OTHER'S AREA OF EXPERTISE. ADDITIONALLY, CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY PROFESSIONALS WILL BE CROSS-TRAINED WITH CORE LABORATORY PROFESSIONALS. PHYSICIAN OFFICE LABORATORY (POL) STAFF WHO PERFORM POINT OF CARE (POC) TESTING WILL BE TRAINED IN QUALITY ASSURANCE, QUALITY CONTROL AND LABORATORY SAFETY, AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PARTICIPANTS WILL BE TRAINED IN LABORATORY SAFETY AND ACCESSIONING. THE PROJECT IS IN THREE PHASES: YEAR 1 IS A PILOT STUDY OF 10 PARTICIPANTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CENTER (UMMC)'S CORE AND MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORIES, 10 LABORATORY PROFESSIONALS FROM THE MARYLAND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY, 10 POL STAFF AND 10 WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PARTICIPANTS WHO WILL BE TRAINED AT THE DMRT STUDENT LABS. UMMC CLINICAL LABORATORIES AND THE MARYLAND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY ARE COLLABORATING PARTNERS. ALL TRAINING ACTIVITIES WILL BE PLACED ON THE CDC-P'S ONLINE PLATFORM ONELAB AND ONELAB REACH FOR USE IN YEARS 2 AND 3. YEAR 2 WILL BRANCH THE TRAINING TO THE 40 HOSPITAL LABORATORIES IN MARYLAND AND TO ANOTHER COHORT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY PROFESSIONALS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PARTICIPANTS.

YEAR 3 WILL FURTHER SUSTAIN THE TRAINING INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES WHERE ALL TRAINING WILL OCCUR USING THE CDC-P'S ONELAB AND ONELAB REACH ONLINE EDUCATIONAL PLATFORMS. COLA INC. WILL BE A COLLABORATING PARTNER AND WILL WORK WITH BOTH THE DMRT AND THE CDC-P TO ASSIST IN CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT IN YEAR 1 AND TO DEVELOP 2 TRAINING VIDEOS IN YEAR 2.

TO RESPOND TO EMERGING THREATS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE LABORATORY COMMUNITY BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND COORDINATE EFFECTIVELY BOTH INTERNALLY, WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM, AND WITH THE PUBLIC. STRONG EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE LABORATORY WORKFORCE SHORTAGE, DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR LABORATORY SERVICES, BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT, AND DIMINISHED EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS, IS GROWING WORSE. THE ONELAB INITIATIVE, LAUNCHED IN 2021, SEEKS TO ENHANCE LABORATORY WORKFORCE CAPACITY BY STRENGTHENING INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN LABORATORY EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROFESSIONALS WITHIN THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, PUBLIC HEALTH AND CLINICAL LABORATORIES, ACADEMIA, PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND MANUFACTURERS.  APPROACH: ASCP\u2019S APPROACH WILL UTILIZE OUR EXPERTISE IN WORKFORCE ASSESSMENT, EDUCATION AND LABORATORY COMMUNITY COMMUNICATIONS, PARTNERSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT TO SUPPORT EXPANSION OF THE ONELAB NETWORK AND CREATION OF A SUSTAINABLE LEARNING COMMUNITY. OUR APPROACH WILL ENHANCE WORKFORCE CAPACITY THROUGH COMMUNICATIONS, ASSESSMENT, AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY OF ENGAGING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. PROPOSED ACTIVITIES ARE IN LINE WITH THE CDC ONELAB INITIATIVE\u2019S BRIDGE \u2013 TRAIN \u2013 SUSTAIN FRAMEWORK.  MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION: ASCP\u2019S EVALUATION/PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PLAN WILL INCLUDE BOTH SUMMATIVE COMPONENTS TO EXAMINE IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT, AS WELL AS FORMATIVE COMPONENTS TO HELP DRIVE PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT.
