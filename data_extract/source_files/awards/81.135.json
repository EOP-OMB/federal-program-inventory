BY CONTRAST, ARPA-E SUPPORTS TRANSFORMATIVE RESEARCH THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE FUNDAMENTALLY NEW LEARNING CURVES. ARPA-E TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS TYPICALLY START WITH COST/PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES WELL ABOVE THE LEVEL OF AN INCUMBENT TECHNOLOGY. GIVEN THE HIGH RISK INHERENT IN THESE PROJECTS, MANY WILL FAIL TO PROGRESS, BUT SOME MAY SUCCEED IN GENERATING A NEW LEARNING CURVE WITH A PROJECTED COST/PERFORMANCE METRIC THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF THE INCUMBENT TECHNOLOGY.\n\nARPA-E FUNDS TECHNOLOGY WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BE DISRUPTIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE MERE CREATION OF A NEW LEARNING CURVE DOES NOT ENSURE MARKET PENETRATION. RATHER, THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF A TECHNOLOGY IS DETERMINED BY THE MARKETPLACE, AND IMPACTFUL TECHNOLOGIES ULTIMATELY BECOME DISRUPTIVE \u2013 THAT IS, THEY ARE WIDELY ADOPTED AND DISPLACE EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES FROM THE MARKETPLACE OR CREATE ENTIRELY NEW MARKETS. ARPA-E UNDERSTANDS THAT DEFINITIVE PROOF OF MARKET DISRUPTION TAKES TIME, PARTICULARLY FOR ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. THEREFORE, ARPA-E FUNDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT, IF TECHNICALLY SUCCESSFUL, HAVE CLEAR DISRUPTIVE POTENTIAL, E.G., BY DEMONSTRATING CAPABILITY FOR MANUFACTURING AT COMPETITIVE COST AND DEPLOYMENT AT SCALE.\n\nARPA-E FUNDS APPLIED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

SPECIFICALLY, PROJECTS FUNDED UNDER THE HESTIA PROGRAM WILL DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE BUILDING MATERIALS AND WHOLE-BUILDING DESIGNS THAT ARE NET CARBON NEGATIVE (SEE SECTION I.B ABOVE) ON A LIFE CYCLE BASIS BY UTILIZING ATMOSPHERIC CO2 OR CH4 (SEE SECTION I.B ABOVE) FROM A WIDE RANGE OF POTENTIAL FEEDSTOCKS (E.G., FORESTRY AND PURPOSE-GROWN PRODUCTS, AGRICULTURAL RESIDUES, MARINE DERIVED, DIRECT CARBON UTILIZATION) IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. HESTIA METRICS ARE:\n\u2022STORAGE OF MORE CARBON IN THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT THAN EMITTED DURING MANUFACTURE, CONSTRUCTION, AND USE, \n\u2022RELEVANT PERFORMANCE TESTING (E.G., FLAMMABILITY, STRENGTH) AS REQUIRED PER APPLICABLE BUILDING CODE AND INCUMBENT SPECIFICATIONS, \n\u2022MARKET ADVANTAGE (E.G., IMPROVED MATERIAL PERFORMANCE IN AT LEAST ONE AREA, LOWER COST, EASIER INSTALLATION) OVER THE BEST-IN-CLASS INCUMBENT BUILDING ELEMENT(S) (I.E. STRUCTURAL AND/OR ENCLOSURE) SELECTED FOR REPLACEMENT, AND \n\u2022SUFFICIENT RETENTION OF CARBON STORAGE OVER SERVICE LIFETIME AND MINIMIZED END-OF-LIFE EMISSIONS WHERE POSSIBLE BY DESIGNING FOR REUSE, REPURPOSING, AND/OR RECYCLING.\n\nTHIS FOA SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIABLE TECHNOLOGIES TO ACHIEVE THESE METRICS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER TO MEET BUILDING CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DEMAND FOR LOW-COST. TECHNICAL CATEGORIES OF INTEREST ARE IDENTIFIED IN SECTION I.E OF THE FOA. PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR THE TECHNICAL CATEGORIES OF INTEREST ARE PROVIDED IN SECTION I.F OF THE FOA.  SECTION I.G OF THE FOA PROVIDES INFORMATION ON LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) REQUIREMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM ARE EVALUATED CONSISTENTLY AND TRANSPARENTLY, A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP AND PERFORM LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS (LCAS) IN CONJUNCTION WITH AND TO SUPPORT APPLICANTS OF THIS FOA. \n\nTHE HESTIA PROGRAM OFFERS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE GROWING NEED FOR MARKET-READY NEGATIVE EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPLEMENT CARBON REMOVAL STRATEGIES BY CHANGING THE PARADIGM FOR BUILDING CONSTRUCTION THROUGH THE USE OF CARBON NEGATIVITY AS A DESIGN PARAMETER. PROJECTS WILL CREATE NOVEL DESIGNS THAT MAXIMIZE THE ENERGY BENEFITS OF CARBON STORAGE IN ADDITION TO MANUFACTURING METHODS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE MATERIALS THEMSELVES. \n\nTO READ THIS FOA IN ITS ENTIRETY, PLEASE GO TO THE ARPA-E WEBSITE AT HTTPS://ARPA-E-FOA.ENERGY.GOV.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "a560dc75-2cd0-baf4-415b-f60d20ba8491-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_DEAR0001634_8900"}, {"internal_id": 155150963, "Award ID": "DEAR0001633", "Award Amount": 1764404.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-12-12", "CFDA Number": "81.135", "Description": "\u201cTHE CIRCULAR HOME: DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF A NET-NEGATIVE CARBON, REUSABLE RESIDENCE\u201d TO WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY.
