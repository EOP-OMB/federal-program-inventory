DEPT.

GDA LABORATORIES (LAB) ARE THE PRIMARY SERVICING LABORATORIES FOR THE REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND ARE FOCUSED ON FOOD ANALYSIS FOR CHEMICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS. SINCE 2011, GDA HAS PURSUED FDA GRANTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS TO IMPROVE AND HARMONIZE OUR STATE REGULATORY AND TESTING CAPABILITY. THROUGH THESE GRANTS THE LAB ACHIEVED ACCREDITATION TO ISO 17025 INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WHICH ALLOWS OUR REGULATORY AGENCIES TO PERFORM CONTRACTUAL WORK ON BEHALF OF FDA. SINCE GDA IS GEORGIA\u2019S REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER FOOD RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS, THE AGENCY HAS INSPECTORS POSITIONED ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF GEORGIA. THESE INSPECTORS ARE TRAINED TO COLLECT SAMPLES AND RETURN THEM TO OUR LAB FOR TESTING THAT CAN SUPPORT REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT.  SINCE GDA ALREADY HAS INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNATED FOR SAMPLE COLLECTION AT RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE ANALYSIS OF MICROORGANISMS BY THE LAB, THIS AWARD OPPORTUNITY NARMS (NATIONAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE MONITORY SYSTEM) SHOULD MAKE A GOOD FIT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY GDA. THE GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (GDPH) LABORATORY IS CURRENTLY AWARDED THIS GRANT BUT HAS CONTACTED GDA TO REQUEST ASSISTANCE OR TAKING IT OVER SINCE THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC HAS BECOME THEIR TOP PRIORITY.  IN SUMMARY, GDA INSPECTORS WILL COLLECT THE SAMPLES AND SEND THEM TO THE LAB PER ROUTINE PROTOCOLS. THE LAB WILL SCREEN THE SAMPLES FOR THE TARGET ORGANISMS SUGGESTED IN THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY AWARD (FOA). THE LAB WILL UTILIZE METHODS DESCRIBED IN THE PROJECT PROTOCOL IN ADDITION TO SCREENING BY APPROVED AND VALIDATED ELISA OR PCR PLATFORMS. ISOLATES SHOWING TYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS WILL BE FURTHER EXAMINED AND CONFIRMED OR SENT TO FDA FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. AS NEEDED, GDPH HAS AGREED TO ALSO ASSIST IN IN WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING OF THE ISOLATES, SINCE GDA DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THAT ABILITY, IN ADDITION TO MENTORING OF THE METHODS AND PROGRAM UNTIL FULLY ESTABLISHED.  THE LAB HAS DEVELOPED AND DEMONSTRATED SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR REGULATORY PARTNERS AND THE GDPH LAB, WHICH SHOULD INDICATE ITS ABILITY TO FULFILL THIS OBJECTIVE. THE LAB ALSO ROUTINELY PERFORMS THOUSANDS OF MICROBIOLOGICAL ANALYSES ON RETAIL FOOD SAMPLES ANNUALLY. IF AWARDED, GDA WILL BE CAPABLE OF ENHANCING AND STRENGTHENING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE SURVEILLANCE DATA.

THE ASSOCIATED BACTERIAL TARGETS FROM THESE MEAT MATRICES HAVE BEEN SALMONELLA SPECIES, CAMPYLOBACTER SPECIES (PRIMARILY C. JEJUNI AND C. COLI), ENTEROCOCCUS SPECIES, AND E. COLI. RECENTLY THE NATIONAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE MONITORING SYSTEM (NARMS) PROGRAM HAS MOVED IN A STRATEGIC DIRECTION WITH AN EMPHASIS ON A ONE HEALTH MODEL OF MONITORING, WHICH IS A MULTISECTORAL AND TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACH THAT LOOKS AT THE INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE, ANIMALS, PLANTS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BRING ABOUT NEW PILOT STUDIES THAT WILL EXPAND TESTING TO OTHER MEAT MATRICES AS WELL AS TO ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES SUCH AS SURFACE WATERS AND SOILS.  THE ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY (EM) LABORATORY AT NMDOH SLD IS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE LATEST NARMS PILOT STUDY INVOLVING SEAFOOD AND IS DOING WELL WITH ISOLATING THE INTENDED TARGETS: VIBRIO SPECIES, AEROMONAS SPECIES, ENTEROCOCCUS SPECIES, AND LACTOSE FERMENTERS. EM LABORATORY ENJOYS PARTICIPATING IN THE PILOT STUDY AND CURRENTLY HAS SOME METHOD MODIFICATIONS TO BETTER IMPROVE RECOVERY OF SOME OF THE LISTED TARGETS. THE SEAFOOD PILOT STUDY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CONSUMPTION OF SEAFOOD, PARTICULARLY AQUACULTURE PRODUCTS, IS PROJECTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AND SUCH INDUSTRIES RELY HEAVILY ON THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS TO COMBAT INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT THREATEN PRODUCTION.  PURCHASING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED, IN TERMS OF THE MONTHLY SHOPPING FREQUENCY FOR RAW MEAT SAMPLES AND TIME ALLOTMENTS FOR SUCH OPERATIONS (LIMITED TO 3 HOURS), DUE TO A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED PURCHASING PERSONNEL EQUIPPED WITH P-CARDS. THE EM LABORATORY WAS RECENTLY PROVIDED WITH A P-CARD WHICH WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO EXPAND SHOPPING / SAMPLE GATHERING CAPABILITIES FOR THE START OF THIS UPCOMING GRANT CYCLE. NO LONGER WILL THE EM LABORATORY BE LIMITED TO JUST ONE SHOPPING EVENT PER MONTH, BUT INSTEAD IS PLANNING ON GOING ONCE PER WEEK. EM LABORATORY PERSONNEL WILL ADDITIONALLY BE ABLE TO PURCHASE RETAIL MEAT SAMPLES FROM OTHER CITIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF NEW MEXICO THAT PREVIOUSLY WAS NOT POSSIBLE. SUCH TEMPORAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSIONS SHOULD OVERALL PROVIDE FOR MORE MEANINGFUL DATA TO THE NARMS PROGRAM. EXPECTED OUTCOMES  THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE PREVALENCE OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE AMONG SALMONELLA, CAMPYLOBACTER, E. COLI AND ENTEROCOCCI ISOLATED FROM RETAIL SAMPLES OF RETAIL CHICKEN, GROUND TURKEY, GROUND BEEF AND PORK CHOPS PURCHASED FROM GROCERY STORES IN NEW MEXICO. THE INFORMATION OBTAINED WILL ALSO HELP OUR EPIDEMIOLOGISTS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PREVALENCE OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE IN NEW MEXICO. THE LABORATORY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TESTING FOR THIS PROJECT FOLLOWING ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND ALSO PARTICIPATE IN ANY PILOT STUDIES THAT ARE INTRODUCED. THE APPROVAL OF A P-CARD FOR THE EM SECTION WILL ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL COVERAGE WITH THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO OVER THE FIVE-YEAR GRANT PROJECT.
