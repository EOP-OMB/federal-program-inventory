THE PURPOSE OF THIS 1 YEAR PROJECT IS TO ENGAGE WITH NUMEROUS WILDLIFE AGENCIES TO DEVELOP STANDARDIZED APPROACHES FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND SURVEILLANCE OF MANGE IN AMERICAN BLACK BEARS AND TO CONDUCT APPLIED AND HUMAN DIMENSIONS RESEARCH STUDIES THAT WILL PROVIDE DATA TO IMPROVE MANAGEMENT OF BLACK BEARS. SARCOPTIC MANGE IS A QUINTESSENTIAL ONE HEALTH DISEASE OF HUNDREDS OF WILD AND DOMESTIC SPECIES THAT RESULTS IN HAIR LOSS, EMACIATION AND MORTALITY IN SEVERE CASES. SARCOPTIC MANGE IN BLACK BEARS HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM A GROWING LIST OF STATES AND IS A CONCERN FOR INDIVIDUAL BEAR HEALTH, PUBLIC PERCEPTION, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALIZED POPULATION EFFECTS, YET THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THIS EMERGENCE REMAINS UNCLEAR. NOTABLY, SINCE 2017, BEAR MANGE HAS EMERGED IN SEVERAL NEW STATES AND HAS BECOME A GROWING ISSUE IN ENDEMIC STATES. ALTHOUGH SARCOPTIC MANGE IS THE MOST COMMON FORM, MITE IDENTIFICATION IS NEEDED IN EACH CASE TO RULE OUT ONE OF THE OTHER THREE SPECIES OF MANGE MITES OR TO DETECT NOVEL MITES (E.G., CHORIOPTES WAS NOT KNOWN TO CAUSE BEAR MANGE UNTIL 2020). THERE IS A NEED FOR STATES TO HAVE A STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF MANGE ON BEAR POPULATIONS. THIS INCLUDES SAMPLE COLLECTION, TESTING, REPORTING, RESPONSE TO INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS, RESPONSE TO PUBLIC INQUIRIES, ETC. WE WILL DEVELOP A SYSTEMATIC DATA COLLECTION PROTOCOL AND DEVELOP COUNTY LEVEL INTERACTIVE MAPS THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH STATE AGENCIES. THE STANDARDIZED DATA SUBMISSION PROCESS (WEB PORTAL, EXCEL SHEET, SCWDS SUBMISSION, OR COMBINATION OF THESE) WILL CONTINUE AFTER THE GRANT THROUGH SCWDS STATE AGREEMENTS. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A WEBSITE THAT HOSTS THIS MAP AND DATA AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION GENERATED DURING THIS GRANT (E.G., INFO SHEETS ON WILDLIFE MANGE, COMMUNICATION MATERIALS, TRAINING MATERIALS (E.G., VIDEOS), ETC.). THIS ENSURES THAT ALL STATE FEDERAL AGENCIES, NGOS, WILDLIFE REHABILITATORS, ETC. HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND VETTED BY BIOLOGISTS, VETERINARIANS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO ADDRESSES SEVERAL APPLIED RESEARCH NEEDS THAT WILL HELP UNDERSTAND FACTORS THAT INCREASE RISK OF SEVERE MANGE. THE FIRST STUDY INVESTIGATES MITE BURDENS FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE BODY. THIS STUDY SERVES TWO PURPOSES. FIRST, TO DETERMINE IF MITE BURDENS CORELATE WITH MANGE SEVERITY OR OUTCOME AND SECONDLY, THESE DATA HAVE AN APPLIED APPLICATION RELATED TO DIAGNOSTIC SAMPLING. LOW OR VARIATION IN MITE BURDENS IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE BODY MAY RESULT IN AN ANIMAL BEING INCORRECTLY CALLED NEGATIVE. THE SECOND PROPOSED STUDY IS RELATED TO TOXIN EXPOSURE, IN PARTICULAR ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDES (AR). WILDLIFE ARE EXPOSED TO NUMEROUS TOXINS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT LIVE IN AND AROUND HUMANS MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK OF EXPOSURE. MORTALITY DUE TO LEAD OR ANTICOAGULANT EXPOSURE HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED, BUT SOME TOXINS MAY HAVE LONG TERM OR INDIRECT EFFECTS WHICH ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD, ALTHOUGH MANY CAN IMPAIR IMMUNE COMPETENCE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE STUDIES THAT SUGGEST THAT EXPOSURE OF WILDLIFE TO TOXICANTS CAN INCREASE THEIR RISK OF CLINICAL MANGE. FINALLY, NOT ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH MANGE DIE OR NEED TO BE EUTHANIZED, BUT THIS HIGHLY VISIBLE DISEASE CHALLENGES MANAGERS, AS PUBLIC CONCERNS OVER ANIMAL WELFARE ARE COMMON. WE WILL CONDUCT HUMAN DIMENSIONS RESEARCH TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES TO ASSIST WILDLIFE AGENCIES. HOWEVER, THE PUBLIC OFTEN OPPOSES EUTHANASIA, BASED ON THEIR VALUES, ATTITUDES, BELIEFS AND INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF DISEASE. TO IMPROVE MANAGEMENT, DATA ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY COMMUNICATION MESSAGES TAILORED TO PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT CORE VALUES TO ENGENDER SUPPORT FOR MANAGEMENT OF MANGE.

AS A RESULT, WOMEN ARE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS A KEY DEMOGRAPHIC TO SUPPORT THE AMERICAN HUNTING AND FISHING HERITAGE. EVEN WITH SUCCESSFUL RECRUITMENT, MANAGERS HAVE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS WITH RETENTION BECAUSE EVEN AFTER INITIAL TRAINING, WOMEN NEED MORE MENTORSHIP AND SUPPORT TO DO OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES ON THEIR OWN.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED  WE WILL CONDUCT A PROGRAM EVALUATION, CREATE AN INTERACTIVE TOOL, ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE, AND SHARE OUR FINDINGS ACROSS A DIVERSE AUDIENCE TO ENHANCE MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AND INCREASE RETENTION. WE WILL USE FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS ARE BEST FOR INCREASING WOMEN S RETENTION IN HUNTING AND FISHING SPORTS.

HOWEVER, THESE DATA ARE CRITICAL IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS THAT POACHING ULTIMATELY HAS ON PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES. LIKEWISE, DETERMINING WHY POACHERS CHOOSE TO VIOLATE WILDLIFE LAWS IS CRITICAL FOR ESTABLISHING ADEQUATE PUNITIVE CONTROLS THAT ULTIMATELY WILL HELP TO REDUCE OR DETER POACHING. YET, LITTLE EMPIRICAL DATA EXIST ON WHAT MOTIVATES INDIVIDUALS TO POACH. AND WHILE STATES HAVE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS THAT ASSIGN PENALTIES AND RESTITUTION FOR POACHING, THE GREATEST IMPACT IS AFFORDED WHEN THOSE LAWS ARE CONSISTENT, DATA-SUPPORTED, AND FAIRLY ENFORCED BY PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE TO 1) QUANTIFY THE DETECTION RATES OF POACHING ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE U.S., 2) DETERMINE THE MOTIVATIONS THAT CAUSE POACHERS TO TAKE WILDLIFE ILLEGALLY, 3) DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS PURSUE AND ISSUE FINES AND PENALTIES THAT ARE PROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF POACHED WILDLIFE, AND 4) PROVIDES TATE WILDLIFE AGENCIES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY, TO BETTER INFORM THEM ON BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR EFFECTIVELY REDUCING RATES OF ILLEGAL TAKE OF WILDLIFE. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS MAY INCLUDE SUGGESTIONS FOR CONSISTENCY IN FINES, PENALTIES, AND REPLACEMENT COSTS FOR POACHED WILDLIFE AS WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE DETECTION AND CONVICTION OF CRIMINALS THAT TAKE WILDLIFE ILLEGALLY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "cac996ad-f247-695e-224a-38a158429d12-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F22AP00699_1448"}, {"internal_id": 146954272, "Award ID": "F22AP00694", "Award Amount": 199061.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-03-08", "CFDA Number": "15.628", "Description": "UTILIZING A NOVEL GENETIC RESOURCE TO INFORM MANAGEMENT OF CWD", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fa5b3fd5-23cd-de7a-5231-0e7bafe1843e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F22AP00694_1448"}, {"internal_id": 147751303, "Award ID": "F22AP00690", "Award Amount": 93555.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-08", "CFDA Number": "15.628", "Description": "RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS OF POLICY AND LAW TO PREVENTTRANSLOCATION OF FERAL SWINETHE WILLFUL OR ACCIDENTAL INTRODUCTION OF FERAL SWINE INTO SUITABLE HABITATS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA IS PERHAPS ONE OF OUR MOST SERIOUS CONSERVATION ISSUES.
