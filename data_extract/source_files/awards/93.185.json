ALTHOUGH MOST COVID-19 PATIENTS RECOVER WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, SOME HAVE SYMPTOMS THAT PERSIST FOR MONTHS AFTER RECOVERING FROM AN ACUTE INFECTION WITH SARS-COV-2 (I.E., REFERRED TO AS POST COVID-19 CONDITIONS [PCC]). BECAUSE THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION VARIES FROM PERSON TO PERSON, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO CONSENSUS ON THE DEFINITION OF THIS SYNDROME. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THOSE WITH MORE SEVERE ACUTE INFECTIONS (I.E., THOSE HOSPITALIZED, TREATED IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, OR WITH ENCEPHALOPATHY) MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONE PCC AND MULTIPLE PCCS. THE NIH PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED THAT 10-30% OF THOSE INFECTED WITH SARS-COV-2 MAY EXPERIENCE PCCS; HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON THE POPULATION STUDIED, PCC DEFINITION, AND LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP, SOME STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THAT AS MANY AS 87% OF COVID-19 SURVIVORS MAY EXPERIENCE PCCS. COLLECTIVELY, EMERGING FINDINGS FROM COVID-19 AND OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS SUGGEST THAT A SIZABLE FRACTION OF PATIENTS WILL EXPERIENCE PERSISTING NEUROLOGIC, RESPIRATORY, CARDIOVASCULAR, MUSCULAR, AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. FURTHER, THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES OBSERVED WITH RESPECT TO COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS ARE LIKELY TO ALSO MANIFEST AMONG THOSE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HEALTH SEQUELAE FOLLOWING AN ACUTE SARS-COV-2 INFECTION.

THE MODEL WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT (E.G., USING OUTCOME METRICS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF POLIO INFECTIONS DURING A SPECIFIED TIME HORIZON) AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON OUTBREAK PREVENTION, DETECTION, AND RESPONSE. WE WILL EXAMINE INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDE THE USE OF SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, PREVENTIVE ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION, AND RESPONSIVE SUPPLEMENTAL IMMUNIZATION. SIMILARLY, THE MODELS CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE SURVEILLANCE STRATEGIES ENSURING SENSITIVITY AROUND POLIOVIRUS EMERGENCE AND CONTAINMENT BREACHES FROM PEFS.  THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE PROJECT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:  1)\tA DETAILED (DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATION-BASED) POLIOVIRUS TRANSMISSION MODEL THAT INCORPORATES OUTBREAK PREVENTION AND RESPONSE STRATEGIES SUCH AS SUPPLEMENTAL IMMUNIZATION ACTIVITIES (SIAS) AND ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION (RI) CALIBRATED TO TARGET POPULATIONS.  2)\tA BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO INTERRUPT CVDVP2 OUTBREAKS. THE TEAM WILL EVALUATE DIFFERENT OUTBREAK PREVENTION AND RESPONSE STRATEGIES THAT VARY IN CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THE VACCINE CHOICE AND THE COVERAGE OF IMMUNIZATION CAMPAIGNS. WE WILL EVALUATE THESE STRATEGIES IN TERMS OF THEIR COST AND EFFECTIVENESS IN PREVENTING CASES OF POLIOVIRUS TO MAKE EFFICIENT USE OF LIMITED RESOURCES FOR OUTBREAK PREVENTION AND RESPONSE.  3)\tA BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO INTEGRATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SURVEILLANCE TO DETECT POLIOVIRUS SENSITIVELY. THE TEAM WILL ADAPT THE MODEL TO INCLUDE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AND INVESTIGATE HOW INTEGRATED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS CAN SENSITIVELY DETECT CIRCULATING VIRUSES AND PEF CONTAINMENT BREACHES.  4)\tTRAINING AND EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN STATISTICAL AND MATHEMATICAL MODELING. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL PROVIDE DIRECT TECHNICAL GUIDANCE TO GRADUATE STUDENTS INVOLVED IN THE PROPOSED WORK AND PROVIDE DIRECT TECHNICAL GUIDANCE CREATE AN EDUCATIONAL CASE STUDY AND GAME BASED ON THE WORK IN THIS PROJECT WHICH WILL GIVE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN EXPERIENCE CREATING MODELS TO GUIDE DECISION-MAKING THROUGH AN INTERACTIVE GAME.  OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM CONSISTS OF EXPERTISE IN OPERATIONS RESEARCH, STATISTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING, INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELING, POLIOVIRUS ERADICATION EFFORTS, AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMMING, AND WILL ALSO CONSULT WITH COLLABORATORS WHO HAVE DEEP EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCES RELEVANT TO THE PROJECT.

THE GPEI WAS OFF TRACK PRIOR TO SARS-COV-2 EMERGENCE AND DECLARATION OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN 2020.  THE GPEI FACES MULTIPLE CHALLENGES: (I) COMPLETING WPV ERADICATION, (2) ENDING THE ONGOING TRANSMISSION OF SEROTYPE 2 VACCINE-DERIVED POLIOVIRUSES (VDPV2S) 5 YEARS AFTER GLOBAL CESSATION OF SEROTYPE 2 OPV FOR NON-EMERGENCY USE, (3) LIMITED FINANCIAL AND VACCINE RESOURCES, AND (4) THE NEED TO RECOVER PROGRAMMATIC ACTIVITIES FROM THE DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY COVID-19.

THE COVID-19 VACCINE IS THE BEST CHANCE AT AN ?EQUALIZER? THAT CAN LEAD TO A RECOVERY FOR THE COUNTRY; BUT IMMUNIZATION EFFORTS WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IF HISPANICS ARE NOT VACCINATED. THROUGH A MULTI-PROGNED COMMUNICATIONS CAMPAIGN, UNIDOSUS WILL INCREASE AWARENESS, EDUCATION, AND PROMOTION OF THE COVID-19 VACCINE AMONG LATINOS, INCLUDING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, E.G. ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, UNIDOSUS WILL PARTNER WITH SEVEN SUBAWARDEES TO DEPLOY MESSAGING THAT PROMOTES VACCINATION ACTIVITIES AND LOCAL CALLS TO ACTIONS.  BROADER, NATIONAL EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE ENGAGEMENT OF TRUSTED INFLUENCERS FROM VARIOUS SECTORS AND USE OF UNIDOSUS?S VAST COMMUNICATIONS ASSETS TO DEPLOY THIS EDUCATION AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. THE CAMPAIGN WILL BROADLY DISSEMINATE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY RELEVANT INFORMATION ON THE VACCINE TO FOSTER TRUST IN ITS SAFETY AND EFFICACY, THEREBY IMPROVING THE POTENTIAL PARTICIPATION RATE AMONG LATINOS RECEIVING THE VACCINE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": 17890469.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "339aee0f-60b3-e00a-62e1-07cfb775f842-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH23IP922643_7523"}, {"internal_id": 125133217, "Award ID": "NH23IP922642", "Award Amount": 5783342.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-01-29", "CFDA Number": "93.185", "Description": "VACUNAS PARA TODOS: NATIONAL HISPANIC NETWORK TO INCREASE VACCINATION COVERAGE AND REDUCE DISPARITIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": 5580009.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e8a43bc4-6056-dc86-1b94-76966a6f278b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH23IP922642_7523"}, {"internal_id": 125133989, "Award ID": "NH23IP922641", "Award Amount": 18246214.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-01-29", "CFDA Number": "93.185", "Description": "NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE VACCINATION COVERAGE PROGRAM - PROJECT ABSTRACTTHE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES FACE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CHALLENGES AND DISPARITIES RELATIVE TO OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES, A TRUTH BORNE OUT YET AGAIN UNDER THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

THE FOCUS OF THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS IN TWENTY (20) URBAN LEAGUE COMMUNITIES WOULD BE TWO-FOLD. FIRST, OUR FOCUS WILL BE ON IDENTIFYING PARTNERS TO BE PUBLIC ADVOCATES FOR VACCINATION AND COMMUNITY / NON-TRADITIONAL SITES (BARBER SHOPS, COMMUN ITY CENTERS, CHURCHES, MOSQUES, ETC.) WHERE VACCINATIONS CAN BE GIVEN. THE SECOND FOCUS WILL BE ON BUILDING PUBLIC WILL VIA AN EMPHASIS ON EFFORTS TO IMPROVE VACCINE UPTAKE AND AWARENESS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND MINIMIZE BARRIERS TO UPTAKE, WHILE ALSO RAISING AWARENESS ON UNDERLYING POLICY, INVESTMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION AND CHANGED PRACTICE THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REALIZE HEALTH EQUITY AND BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THE LARGER BLACK / AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY.
