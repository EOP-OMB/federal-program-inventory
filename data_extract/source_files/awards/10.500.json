THE INDIANA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND INDIANA COMMISSION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED TO ADDRESS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT OCCUR AMONG HOOSIER YOUTH. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS, AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS WHEN ONE GROUP OF STUDENTS OUTPERFORMS ANOTHER GROUP AND THE DIFFERENCE IN AVERAGE SCORES FOR THE TWO GROUPS IS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (HEMPHILL, VENNEMAN &AMP; RAHMAN, 2011). WHILE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH RACIAL DISPARITIES, THEY CAN ALSO AFFECT GROUPS SUCH AS LOW-INCOME STUDENTS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ARE OFTEN SEEN NOT ONLY ON TEST SCORES, BUT IN MANY ASPECTS OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM, SUCH AS GAPS IN ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY FACILITIES, TEACHERS, RESOURCES, AND OPPORTUNITIES. ALTHOUGH GAPS BETWEEN RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS HAVE DECREASED OVER THE LAST DECADE, HISPANIC YOUTH ARE STILL MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THAN CHILDREN OF OTHER MAJOR RACES/ETHNICITIES (HECKMAN &AMP; LAFONTAINE, 2010).

THIRD, UWC CREATES A SPACE FOR YOUTH TO AFFILIATE WITH OTHER LIKE-MINDED STUDENTS TO CREATE THE NECESSARY POSITIVE PEER SUPPORTS THAT WILL HELP THEM AVOID MORE PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIORS.

THE PROJECT BUILDS UPON COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH IN RURAL SOUTHWEST COLORADO WITH DIVERSE COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS, AND ALSO DRAWS ON PREVIOUS HELP DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION WORK IN URBAN COLORADO LATINO COMMUNITIES. THE OUTCOME--TO SUPPORT TEENS IN DEMONSTRATING THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ATTITUDES, AND BEHAVIORS NECESSARY FOR FULFILLING AND CONTRIBUTING LIVES--DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH THE TOP 10 CRITICAL ISSUES IN A 2021 COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY THE STATE OF COLORADO/EXTENSION. HELP INCLUDES THE WHOLE FAMILY IN PROGRAM DELIVERY BECAUSE TEENS&#39; KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ATTITUDES, AND BEHAVIORS ARE AFFECTED BY THEIR FAMILIES, MAKING PARENT/CAREGIVER EDUCATION AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF EMPIRICALLY-BASED PROGRAMS TO AMELIORATE TEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND OBESITY. PROGRAMS THAT ARE FAMILY-INCLUSIVE, AS OPPOSED TO CENTERED ON YOUTH ALONE, ARE MORE CULTURALLY ACCEPTABLE AND EFFECTIVE AMONG LATINO AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. LATINO AND NATIVE AMERICAN TEENS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS, OBESITY, OBESITY-RELATED PREVENTABLE CHRONIC DISEASES, AND LIMITED ACCESS TO LIFESTYLE PROGRAMS GROUNDED IN RESEARCH.

IN THE CONTEXT OF FORMAL DELIVERY, DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE MATERIALS ALIGNED WITH REQUIRED STATE STANDARDS WILL SUPPORT YOUTH AS THEY EXPERIENCE RIGOROUS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PRACTICES (NGSS LEAD STATES, 2013). YOUTH WILL NOT ONLY LEARN FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE CONTENT AND BUILD STEM SKILLS, BUT WILL ALSO APPLY SCIENCE CONCEPTS TO REAL-WORLD QUESTIONS AROUND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY (E.G., THE POWER OF WIND, BIOFUELS), EPIDEMIOLOGY (E.G., MICROBES ON MY MIND), AND FOOD PRODUCTION (E.G., POULTRY EXPERIMENTING, BEE KEEPERS). CONNECTING STEM CONTENT TO ISSUES THAT MATTER TO YOUTH AND THEIR COMMUNITIES CAN ENCOURAGE YOUTH TO ENVISION THEMSELVES AS ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE FUTURE OF AGRISCIENCE. YOUTH WILL DEVELOP POSITIVE SOCIAL NORMS THROUGH WORK WITH THEIR PEERS TO UNDERSTAND AND ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT STEM-RELATED ISSUES THAT MAY IMPACT THEIR FUTURES. THE PROPOSED PROJECT FURTHER SUPPORTS YOUTH DEVELOPMENT THROUGH AN EMPHASIS ON SAFE, STRUCTURED, AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS BEYOND THE CLASSROOM WALLS. THE ROBOTICS COMPONENTS INTRODUCE YOUTH TO ENGINEERING AND CODING IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT VALUES ITERATION AND PRODUCTIVE FAILURE. HEALTHY, POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ADULT MENTORS CAN SUPPORT YOUTH TO DEVELOP INCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH TEAMMATES, SET COMMUNAL AND INDIVIDUAL GOALS, AND TAKE APPROPRIATE INTELLECTUAL RISKS. THROUGH ROBOTICS, YOUTH DEVELOP LEADERSHIP SKILLS AS THEY DEMONSTRATE MASTERY AND ENGAGE IN THEIR OWN LEARNING TO PREPARE FOR COMPETITIONS.

ACCORDINGLY, THE PURPOSE OF MILITARY REACH (REFERRED TO AS REACH TO REPRESENT THE INTERSECTION OF RESEARCH AND OUTREACH) IS TO SUPPORT DOD AND, IN TURN, MILITARY FAMILIES BY (1) TRANSLATING EMPIRICAL RESEARCH FOCUSED ON MILITARY FAMILY LIFE INTO PRACTICAL PRODUCTS (E.G., REPORTS, FACT SHEETS, ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHIES) AND (2) ENSURING THAT THESE USER-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO STAKEHOLDERS WHO SERVE AND WORK ON BEHALF OF MILITARY FAMILIES. STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, POLICYMAKERS, HELPING PROFESSIONALS, AND MILITARY LEADERSHIP. THIS MISSION ALIGNS WITH THE FY 2018-22 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) STRATEGIC PLAN, SPECIFICALLY GOAL 4, OBJECTIVE 4.2, TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY AND RURAL QUALITY OF LIFE WITH ACCESS TO RESOURCES, AS WELL AS THE 2008 FARM BILL THAT COMMISSIONED THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE (NIFA) TO ENHANCE HUMAN SCIENCES AND IMPROVE THE WELL-BEING OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING THE ~2.1 MILLION MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN THE MILITARY AND THEIR 2.6 MILLION FAMILY MEMBERS (DOD, 2020).SINCE 2017, WHEN OUR AUBURN UNIVERSITY (AU) TEAM WAS AWARDED THE COMPETITIVE REACH GRANT, WE HAVE WORKED COLLABORATIVELY ALONGSIDE DOD&#39;S OFFICE OF MILITARY COMMUNITY AND FAMILY POLICY (MC&AMP;FP) AND NIFA TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE MILITARY FAMILY RESEARCH AND GENERATE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AND TOOLS FOR STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF FAMILY SUPPORT AND READINESS.

THE HEALTH OF THE FAMILY SYSTEM IS TIED TO SERVICE MEMBER READINESS AND THE FAMILY&#39;S ABILITY TO ADAPT TO STRESS (OSHRI, ET AL., 2015). MILITARY FAMILIES ARE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, FAMILIES WHO FACE NORMATIVE STRESSORS IN THE CONTEXT OF FAMILY LIFE, INCLUDING MARITAL STRAINS, PARENTING DIFFICULTIES, AND HEALTH CHALLENGES (LUCIER-GREER ET AL., 2020; O&#39;NEAL ET AL., 2016). THEY ALSO ENCOUNTER CIRCUMSTANTIAL STRESSORS RELATED TO MILITARY LIFE (E.G., DEPLOYMENT, RELOCATIONS); CHRONIC MILITARY-RELATED STRESSORS LEAD TO HEIGHTENED RISK FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS, UNSTABLE FAMILY FUNCTIONING, AND SOCIAL ISOLATION (LUCIER-GREER ET AL., 2014; O&#39;NEAL &AMP; MANCINI, 2020) AS WELL AS DIFFERENTIAL AND SOMETIMES LIMITING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MILITARY SPOUSES (E.G., UNDEREMPLOYMENT, LOWER PAY; BURKE &AMP; MILLER, 2018; MEADOWS ET AL., 2016) AND CHILDREN (E.G., SCHOOL TRANSITIONS, CHANGES IN PEER GROUPS; BRADSHAW ET AL., 2010). NONETHELESS, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING OUR OWN, CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATES THAT MILITARY FAMILIES TEND TO BE HIGH FUNCTIONING AND RESILIENT (O&#39;NEAL ET AL., 2016). MILITARY FAMILIES&#39; OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN CONTINGENT ON AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND WHETHER FORMAL SYSTEMS (E.G., POLICY-GENERATING OFFICES) AND INFORMAL SUPPORTS MEET THEIR NEEDS (MANCINI, O&#39;NEAL, &AMP; LUCIER-GREER, 2020). UNFORTUNATELY, IT CAN TAKE ~17YEARS FOR FORMAL SYSTEMS AND PROFESSIONALS TO HAVE ACCESS TO AND INTEGRATE \"CURRENT\" RESEARCH INTO THEIR DECISION MAKING AND SERVICES (MORRIS ET AL., 2011; MUNRO ET AL., 2016).

ABOUT 32% OF MINORITY STUDENTS ATTEND \"DROPOUT FACTORIES\" COMPARED TO ONLY 8% OF WHITE STUDENTS CREATING WIDENING ISSUES OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION. DROPOUT INCREASES THE RISK OF LIVING IN POVERTY AND IMPOVERISHES THE NATION. ON AVERAGE, STUDENTS WHO DROP OUT EARN $30,000 PER YEAR LESS THAN DO STUDENTS FROM THE SAME SOCIOECONOMIC STATES THAT GRADUATED BY THE TIME THEY ARE IN MIDDLE ADULTHOOD.

PROGRAM IS A FAMILY-BASED PROGRAM THAT TARGETS LOW-INCOME MIDDLE-SCHOOL YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE UNITED WE CAN! (UWC) PROGRAM HELPS THESE YOUTH DO BETTER IN SCHOOL, AVOID RISKY BEHAVIORS SUCH AS DRUG USE AND TEEN PREGNANCY, AND REDUCE THE CHRONIC STRESS IN THEIR LIVES THAT LEAD TO SCHOOL DROPOUT AND LONG-TERM PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.HOW DOES IT WORK? UWC HAS THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS: FAMILY ENGAGEMENT, YOUTH PERSONAL AGENCY, AND POSITIVE PEER AFFILIATIONS.FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. FAMILIES ATTEND A SERIES OF MEETINGS IN WHICH WE USE FUN ACTIVITIES AND GAMES TO HELP PARENTS BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILD&#39;S SCHOOLING, LEARN GENERAL PARENTING SKILLS, BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE U.S. EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, AND LEARN HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR CHILD&#39;S SUCCESS. IN ADDITION TO INCREASED SCHOOL ENGAGEMENT, THE SESSIONS: (A) HELP PARENTS NETWORK WITH OTHERS IN A WAY THAT REDUCES SOCIAL ISOLATION, (B) REGAIN A SENSE OF CONTROL OVER THEIR AND THEIR CHILD&#39;S FUTURE, AND (C) CULTIVATE THE HOPE NECESSARY TO SUCCESSFULLY COPE WITH STRESS AND PRACTICE POSITIVE PARENTING. THESE SESSIONS ARE FOLLOWED UP BY 14 MONTHLY BOOSTER SESSIONS IN WHICH WECONNECT PARENTS AND YOUTH TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES, INTRODUCE NEW THEMES, AND PRACTICE THE SKILLS ALREADY LEARNED.YOUTH PERSONAL AGENCY. THIS COMPONENT EMPOWERS YOUTH TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN FUTURE. YOUTH ARE ASSIGNED TO A SUCCESS COACH WHO WORKS WITH THEM TO DEVELOP A PERSONAL SUCCESS PLAN FOCUSED ON EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND CRITICAL LIFE SKILLS. COACHES ARE YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN COLLEGE OR HAVE RECENTLY GRADUATED. COACHES MONITOR STUDENTS&#39; ACADEMIC PROGRESS USING DATA PROVIDED BY THE SCHOOL ON ABSENCES, GRADES, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS. WHEN CHALLENGES ARISE, COACHES USE THE CHALLENGES TO HELP YOUTH DEVELOP LIFE SKILLS SUCH AS EMOTION REGULATION, GOAL SETTING, CRITICAL THINKING, PROBLEM-SOLVING, AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES OF POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT (E.G., PERSONAL CARE, STUDY HABITS, TIME MANAGEMENT). COACHES ALSO MAINTAIN REGULAR CONTACT WITH PARENTS TO HELP FOSTER STRONG PARENT-ADOLESCENT RELATIONSHIPS AND TO ENCOURAGE AND EMPOWER THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR CHILD&#39;S ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.POSITIVE PEER AFFILIATIONS. YOUTH PARTICIPATE IN REGULAR ACTIVITIES (MONTHLY DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR AND WEEKLY DURING THE SUMMER) DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SPACE IN WHICH THEY CAN BOND WITH EACH OTHER AND DEVELOP A SENSE OF BELONGING WITH A GROUP OF LIKE-MINDED PEERS. ACTIVITIES FOCUS ON EXPOSURE TO SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) RELATED CAREERS AS WELL AS TRAINING IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP INCLUDING AN END-OF-YEAR COMPETITION JUDGED BY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OWNERS FROM THE COMMUNITY.

TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL THE PROJECT WILL UTILIZE THE POWER OF THE LAND-GRANT SYSTEM TO ENGAGE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN LEARNING INITIATIVES THAT WILL MOTIVATE THEM TO PURSUE A CAREER IN A STEM-RELATED FIELD. USING THE COLLABORATIVE EXPERTISE OF THE LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND THE STATE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM TO ENGAGE HIGH SCHOOL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE STUDENTS IN ENGAGING AND CHALLENGING HAND-ON ENGINEERING DESIGN PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON AGRICULTURAL ISSUES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.NEED FOR STUDYTHE UNITED STATES IS FALLING DANGEROUSLY BEHIND OTHER NATIONS IN DEVELOPING ITS FUTURE WORKFORCE OF SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, AND TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS (ANTHOLT, 2013). THE SHORTAGE OF PROFESSIONALENGINEERS AND TECHNICIANS IN THE U.S. IS BEING ACUTELY FELT IN TECHNICAL INDUSTRIES, AND THIS SHORTAGE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN FUTURE YEARS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, MAJOR AMERICAN COMPANIES WILL NEED TO ADD NEARLY 1.6 MILLION STEM-SKILLED EMPLOYEES (BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE, 2014). THIS PROBLEM COULD BE REMEDIED IF MORE WOMEN, MINORITIES AND RURAL YOUTH ENTERED THE TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES. WOMEN REPRESENT 52% OF THE U.S. POPULATION, BUT FEWER THAN 10% OF PRACTICING ENGINEERS ARE WOMEN. SIMILAR TRENDS EXIST WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC, NATIVE AMERICAN AND OTHER MINORITY POPULATIONS.SOME OF THE FAILURE OF THE SCIENCE, MATH, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY DISCIPLINES TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THESE POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS IS AN EXPOSURE PROBLEM. CHILDREN FORM CAREER INTERESTS BASED ON WHAT THEY KNOW AND CAN FATHOM. PARENTS&#39; AWARENESS OF AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT STEM EDUCATION IS LOW, WITH THE LOWEST LEVELS EXISTING IN RURAL AREAS (CARNEGIE SCIENCE CENTER,2014). RURAL LOCATED STUDENTS MAKE UP ABOUT 20 TO 25% OF ALL PUBLIC-SCHOOL ENROLLED STUDENTS (OSSOLA, 2014, SHOWALTER, HARTMAN, JOHNSON &AMP; KLEIN, 2019). PERSISTENT CHALLENGES FOR RURAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS INCLUDE A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS, BUDGET CUTS, AND A LACK OF EXTRACURRICULAR RESOURCES. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE MAY ALSO SIMPLY BE A LACK OF ENTHUSIASM AMONG RURAL STUDENTS FOR STEM (STEMPREMIER, 2016, HARRIS &AMP; HODGES, 2018). THESE RURAL SCHOOL STUDENTS OFTEN ARE BEING TAUGHT IN A SETTING WHERE THE TEACHERS ARE UNABLE TO SPECIALIZE AND WHERE LIMITED TEACHING RESOURCES FOR LABORATORIES AND LAB SUPPLIES ARE AVAILABLE.TO ENSURE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS, WE MUST ACT NOW TO PREPARE THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, AND TECHNOLOGY LEADERS. THE POPULAR PRESS AND SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES OF THE U.S. EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO STEM EDUCATION. SOME STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT OUR TEACHERS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY BEING PREPAREDTO TEACH EFFECTIVELY IN THE STEM AREAS (WALSH, 2013). OTHER REPORTS CITE THAT OUR STUDENTS GENERALLY LACK THE MOTIVATION AND HAVE LOW SELF-CONFIDENCE IN LEARNING STEM SUBJECTS (KAPTAN &AMP; TIMURLENK, 2012). THIS PROBLEM IS FURTHER AMPLIFIED WHEN STEM LEARNING IS CONDUCTED IN SMALL, RURAL SCHOOLS. SMALL RURAL SCHOOLS FREQUENTLY ARE RESTRICTED ON THE RANGE AND DEPTH OF STEM COURSES DUE TO A LESS SPECIALIZED TEACHING STAFF.INNOVATIONTHIS PROJECT WILL USE CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING THEORY TO DEVELOP A CURRICULUM IN COMBINATION WITH TEAM-BASED, HANDS-ON PROBLEM SOLVING TO ENGAGE HIGH SCHOOL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE STUDENTS IN THE LEARNING PROCESS. THE CLASSROOM PORTION, USING A SERIES OF SIMPLE CHALLENGES TO LEARN BASIC AND KEY CONCEPTS, WILL PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR THE LABORATORY PORTION WHERE STUDENTS WILL BE PRESENTED WITH A PROBLEM. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, STUDENTS WORKING IN COLLABORATIVE GROUPS WILL USE THE THREE PHASES OF CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING.ENGAGE - THROUGH A PROCESS OF ESSENTIALQUESTIONING, THE LEARNERS MOVE FROM AN ABSTRACT BIG IDEA TO A CONCRETE AND ACTIONABLE CHALLENGE.INVESTIGATE - ALL LEARNERS PLAN AND PARTICIPATE IN A JOURNEY THAT BUILDS THE FOUNDATION FOR SOLUTIONS AND ADDRESSES ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS.ACT - EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS ARE DEVELOPED, IMPLEMENTED WITH AN AUTHENTIC AUDIENCE, AND THEN EVALUATED BASED ON THE RESULTS.\"WHEN FACED WITH A CHALLENGE, SUCCESSFUL GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS LEVERAGE EXPERIENCE, HARNESS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RESOURCES, DEVELOP A PLAN AND PUSH FORWARD TO FIND THE BEST SOLUTION. ALONG THE WAY, THERE IS EXPERIMENTATION, FAILURE, SUCCESS AND ULTIMATELY CONSEQUENCES FOR ACTIONS. BY ADDING CHALLENGES TO LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THE RESULT IS URGENCY, PASSION, AND OWNERSHIP - INGREDIENTS OFTEN MISSING IN SCHOOLS\" (\"CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING,\" 2021). THIS WAS CONFIRMED IN A 2009 STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE NEW MEDIA CONSORTIUM OF 321 STUDENTS IN SIX SCHOOLS WHERE CHALLENGE-BASED LEARNING WAS UTILIZED.

THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN AN ALL-VOLUNTEER FORCE IS INCLUDED IN THE JOHN S. MCCAIN NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. SERVICE MEMBERS NEED TO FOCUS ON THEIR MISSION AND IN ORDER TO DO SO, IT&#39;S CRITICAL THAT THEY KNOW THEIR FAMILIES ARE READY AND PREPARED FOR LIFE&#39;S CHALLENGES. MILITARY FAMILIES FACE UNIQUE STRESSORS INCLUDING PERMANENT CHANGES OF STATION, LENGTHY WORK HOURS FOR THE SERVICE MEMBER, DEPLOYMENTS AND EXPOSURE TO COMBAT-RELATED ACTIVITIES (MACDERMID WADSWORTH, 2010). MOST MILITARY FAMILIES ARE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES BUT COMMUNITY SUPPORT IS CRITICAL TO DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING FAMILY RESILIENCE (BOWEN, MARTIN, &AMP; MANCINI, 2013).THE FAMILY READINESS SYSTEM (DOD INSTRUCTION 1342.22) IS AN \"ANY DOOR\" APPROACH TO ENSURING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE SUPPORTED BY A NETWORK OF PROVIDERS.

THE FRS VISION ALLOWS FAMILIES TO GET SUPPORT ACROSS A RANGE OF SERVICES INCLUDING FINANCIAL COUNSELING, FAMILY SUPPORT/COUNSELING, CAREGIVING TRAINING AND SUPPORT, AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. FUNDAMENTALLY, PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING SERVICES TO MILITARY FAMILIES NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE IN THE FRS AS WELL AS MAINTAIN CONTENT-BASED KNOWLEDGE, TRAINING, AND CREDENTIALS.

THIS WORK IS GUIDED BY THE THEORY THAT A SKILLED AND COLLABORATIVE NETWORK OF MFSPS SUPPORTS SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

FROM MOUNTAINS TO COASTAL PLAINS, GEORGIA&#39;S CLIMATE AND GEOGRAPHY PROVIDE PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR AGRICULTURE. THE BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE HAS LONG BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF GEORGIA&#39;S ECONOMY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DRIVING FORCE AT THE LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL LEVEL. GEORGIA HAS THE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTE OF BEING HOME TO A DIVERSE ARRAY OF FOOD AND FIBER PRODUCTION AND A RICH ASSORTMENT OF THE RELATED ECONOMIC SECTORS THAT MAKE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WORK. TOGETHER, THESE DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY RELATED INDUSTRIES ACCOUNT FOR OVER $74.9 BILLION DOLLARS IN OUTPUT CONTRIBUTION TO GEORGIA&#39;S $917.6 BILLION ECONOMY. IN 2016 GEORGIA RANKED 1ST IN THE NATION IN BROILERS, PEANUTS, AND PECANS; 2ND IN COTTON LINT AND COTTON SEED; 3RD IN BELL PEPPERS, CUCUMBER AND PEACHES. THERE ARE 42,257 FARMS ENCOMPASSING OVER 9.6 MILLION ACRES. THE AVERAGE FARM IS 228 ACRES; AVERAGE AGE OF PRINCIPAL OWNER IS 59.9; 15.1% ARE FEMALE (GROWING SEGMENT); 4.7% ARE BLACK AND 1% HISPANIC (2012 CENSUS).FARMING IS BOTH STRESSFUL AND DANGEROUS. ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS (2013), AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING, AND HUNTING HAD THE HIGHEST FATALITY RATE AT 22.2 FATAL INJURIES PER 100,000 FTE WORKERS. NIOSH EXAMINED 130 OCCUPATIONS AND FOUND LABORERS AND FARM OWNERS HAD THE HIGHEST DEATH RATE FROM STRESS-RELATED CONDITIONS (I.E. HEART DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, ULCERS). NATIONAL SAFETY COUNCIL (2008) DATA FOUND FOR AGRICULTURE, FISHING, AND FORESTRY, APPROXIMATELY 80,000 DISABLING INJURIES OCCUR PER YEAR. NIOSH (2008) ESTIMATED THE RATE OF LOST-WORK-TIME INJURIES FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS TO BE 243 PER DAY; APPROXIMATELY 5% RESULT IN PERMANENT DISABILITY. THE OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS RATE FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WAS NEARLY DOUBLE THAT FOR THE ENTIRE PRIVATE SECTOR (NSC, 2008). AGRICULTURAL HEARING LOSS RANKED 4TH WORST; RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES RANKED 7TH WORST. KIRKHORN AND SCHENKER (2002) NOTED THAT REPORTING IS INADEQUATE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO TRACK TRENDS IN AGRICULTURAL ILLNESSES. THEY STATE THAT DESPITE LOW RATES OF SMOKING, FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASED PREVALENCE OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES. CHRONIC BACK PAIN WAS IDENTIFIED IN 26% OF FARMERS AND AS MANY AS 71% OF SWINE PRODUCERS. HEARING LOSS AFFECTS OVER 50% OF THE FARMING POPULATION. THE GEORGIA HEALTHY FARMERS PROJECT NOTED THAT FARMING WAS A GREATER GENERATOR OF INJURIES AND ILLNESSES PER CAPITA THAN ANY OTHER OCCUPATION.IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE HOW MANY AGRICULTURAL WORKERS EXPERIENCE INJURIES. FARMER, ET. AL. (2008) SUGGESTS THE MAJORITY OF FARM INJURIES ARE HOME TREATED AND NOT REFLECTED IN ACCIDENT STATISTICS. A RECENT STUDY (DEBOY, ET AL, 2008) NOTES THAT PREVALENCE OF DISABILITY MAY BE HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, WITH ESTIMATES BETWEEN .49 AND 1.05 MILLION PEOPLE - WITH ANOTHER 55 TO1.18 MILLION AGRICULTURAL HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS WITH DISABILITIES. THIS RESULTS IN AN ESTIMATED 1.04 TO 2.23 MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN THE AGRICULTURAL POPULATION (WORKFORCE AND HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS).VETERANS HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY ENTERING INTO AGRICULTURAL CAREERS AND THE GEORGIA AGRABILITY HAS SEEN AN INFLUX OF VETERANS ENTERING INTO THE PROGRAM WITH THE MAJORITY BEING NEW FARMERS. MANY OF THE SAME ATTRIBUTES FOR SUCCESS IN FARMING ARE SIMILAR TO THE MILITARY INCLUDING: A WLLINGNESS TO DO HARD WORK; THE ABILITY TO ADJUST QUICKLY WHEN UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR; AND DISCIPLINE TO GET THE JOB DONE. BEING OF SERVICE IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO VETERANS. THERE IS NOT A MORE NOBLE MISSION THAT TO FEED OUR NATION. FARMING HAS ALSO BEEN A SOURCE OF HEALING FOR MANY VETERANS. WATCHING PLANTS AND ANIMALS GROW RECONNECTS ONE TO THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF LIFE.MANY OF THE VETERANS ENTERING INTO AGRICULTURE ALSO MAY HAVE A DISABILITY DIAGNOSIS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THEIR SERVICE. VETERANS&#39; DISABILITY BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A SINGLE-INDEX STANDARDIZED RATING SCHEME, MEASURED AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE. THIS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (VA) SCHEDULE FOR RATING DISABILITIES. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE MILITARY DISABILITY RATING IS INTENDED TO REFLECT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE CONDITION IMPAIRS THE VETERAN&#39;S ABILITY TO WORK, OR, IN THE CASE OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE CONDITION IMPAIRS A SERVICE MEMBER&#39;S ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH OTHERS IN A SOCIAL SETTING. ALL MILITARY DISABILITY RATINGS RANGE FROM 0% TO 100%. A HIGHER DISABILITY RATING REFLECTS MORE SEVERE DISABILITIES. NATIONALLY, THERE ARE OVER 18 MILLION VETERANS AND 21% OF THOSE ARE REPORTED TO HAVE A SERVICE RELATED DISABILITY RATING. IN GEORGIA THERE ARE 651,283 VETERANS AND 140,370 (22%) OF THOSE ARE REPORTED TO HAVE A SERVICE RELATED DISABILITY RATING. OF THOSE 83,285 HAVE A DISABILITY RATING OF 10?60 PERCENT AND 43,577 WITH A DISABILITY RATING OF 70 PERCENT OR HIGHER (CENSUS,2016).IN GEORGIA, AGRABILITY AND THE GEORGIA VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION AGENCY (GVRA) ARE THE ONLY PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON ASSISTING AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES. BEFORE AGRABILITY IN GEORGIA BEGAN IN 2005, THE MAJORITY OF FARMERS IN GEORGIA WERE NOT AWARE OF ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY (AT) OR NEW EMPLOYMENT CONCEPTS THAT WOULD ENABLE THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE PRODUCTIVE. GVRA USUALLY PLACED FARMERS WITH DISABILITIES IN NEW, ALTERNATIVE JOBS.

THESE ISSUES IMPACT ALMOST EVERY HOME ON THE RESERVATION, LEADING TO THE POOR HEALTH AND DISABILITY EPIDEMICS THAT OFTEN KEEP PEOPLE FROM INVESTING IN THEIR FUTURES. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THEM IN A WAY THAT ALSO BUILDS TRIBAL CAPACITY.NUMEROUS STUDIES INDICATE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE IMPACTS OF PERSISTENT POVERTY, FOOD INSECURITY, AND POOR NUTRITION ON HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, INCLUDING MANY DISABILITIES. POOR MENTAL HEALTH, DIABETES, ASTHMA, BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS ALSO HAVE BEEN LINKED TO FOOD INSECURITY. FOOD INSECURITY IS HIGH ON THE PINE RIDGE RESERVATION, WITH ONE IN FOUR HOUSEHOLDS CONSISTENTLY CLASSIFIED AS FOOD INSECURE. OVERALL, CHRONIC DISEASE DECREASES QUALITY OF LIFE, HAS A NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT, AND INCREASES THE NEED FOR SERVICES. GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION RESULTS IN MUCH OF THE POPULATION TRAVELING GREAT DISTANCES (OVER 50 MILES ONE WAY) TO SEE A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. WE ARE FOCUSING ON AMERICAN INDIANS BECAUSE THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CHRONIC DISEASE AND RELATED RISK FACTORS COMPARED TO WHITES IN SD. FOOD INSECURITY CAN ONLY BE SUSTAINABLY ADDRESSED BY THE CREATION OF SMALL LOCAL FARMERS ON THE PINE RIDGE RESERVATION.FOR MANY LAKOTA WITH DISABILITIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH MOBILITY ISSUES, THE UNDEVELOPED STATE OF THE RESERVATION&#39;S COMMUNITIES AND STATE OF DISREPAIR OF MANY HOMES AND BUILDINGS ARE TREMENDOUS BARRIERS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE DURING PERIODS OF INCLEMENT WEATHER AND FOR THOSE LIVING FAR OUT IN THE COUNTRY. ISOLATED BY TWO TRACK DIRT ROADS THAT ARE OFTEN IMPASSABLE, THEY CAN&#39;T ACCESS OUTSIDE SERVICES UPON WHICH THEY DEPEND. THEY CAN BE STUCK INSIDE FOR MONTHS. OUR PROJECT WILL USE ASSISTIVE-TECHNOLOGY AND UNIVERSAL DESIGN TO ASSIST OUR AGRABILITY CLIENTS WITH PLANNING/IMPROVING THEIR SMALL FARM/HOME BUILT ENVIRONMENTS.THE CDC/KAISER PERMANENTE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES (ACES) LANDMARK STUDY, STATES THAT HAVING SIX OR MORE ACES CAN REDUCE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A PERSON BY 20 YEARS OR MORE. ACES MAY PREDICT SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL &AMP; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, ADOPTION OF HEALTH-RISK BEHAVIORS, DISEASE, DISABILITY AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS PRIOR TO AN EARLY DEATH, WHICH ULTIMATELY CREATES A SELF-PERPETUATING CYCLE. MANY ACES ARE LINKED TO PERSISTENT POVERTY, FOOD INSECURITY, AND TRAUMA. EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT INTERVENTION IS NECESSARY TO BREAK THIS CYCLE. AGRABILITY PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK TO HELP ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF ACES AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE PINE RIDGE RESERVATION.ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON DISABILITY (2003), PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ON TRIBAL LANDS: EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION AND INDEPENDENT LIVING, NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE THE MOST DISPROPORTIONATE RATE OF DISABILITIES OF ALL POPULATION GROUPS, COMPOUNDED BY FACTORS SUCH AS HIGH-POVERTY, SCHOOL DROP-OUT RATES, GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION FROM STATE/LOCAL REHABILITATION/HEALTH CARE AND EXTREMELY LIMITED EMPLOYMENT OPTIONS. ONE OF FOUR AMERICAN INDIANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 16-64 ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE A DISABILITY. THIS REPORT GENERALLY FOUND THAT AFTER DIABETES, MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISABILITIES ARE THE MOST OFTEN REPORTED IN INDIAN COUNTRY. AMONG SURVEYS OF INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES (IHS) THE MOST FREQUENTLY OBSERVED PHYSICAL DISABILITIES WERE SPINAL CORD INJURIES (AND OTHER BACK AND NECK PROBLEMS), MOBILITY, TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, ORTHOPEDIC CONDITIONS AND ARTHRALGIA.THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH EXAMINED 130 OCCUPATIONS AND FOUND THAT FARM LABORERS AND OWNERS HAD THE HIGHEST RATE OF DEATHS DUE TO STRESS-RELATED CONDITIONS LIKE HEART AND ARTERY DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, ULCERS AND NERVOUS DISORDERS. IT ALSO FOUND THAT TOO MUCH STRESS CAN MAKE A PERSON MORE ACCIDENT PRONE. ANOTHER REPORT, USDA&#39;S A REVIEW OF FARM ACCIDENT DATA SOURCES AND RESEARCH, STATES THAT AFTER TRACTOR ACCIDENTS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF FARM INJURIES OCCURRED IN BARNS, FIELDS, AND FARM BUILDINGS. THIS SAME REPORT, STATES THAT FARMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE HIGH RATES OF STRESS-RELATED MENTAL DISORDERS, ESPECIALLY DEPRESSION. MANY OF THESE DISORDERS ARE RELATED TO ISOLATION, WEATHER CONDITIONS, AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. CHRONIC DISEASE DECREASES QUALITY OF LIFE, HAS A NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT, AND INCREASES THE NEED FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. MANY OF THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH FARMING TODAY ARE ACTUALLY TIED TO THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY OF SCALE. LARGE ACREAGES REQUIRE LARGE AND DANGEROUS MACHINES. YET, REMOVE THE NEED FOR THESE MACHINES AND THE NEED TO PRODUCE AT SUCH A LARGE SCALE AND YOU REDUCE MANY OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND FINANCIAL STRESSORS AND PHYSICAL DANGERS NEW FARMERS FACE.MOST OF OUR NEW PRODUCERS LACK ANY FARMING INFRASTRUCTURE (BARNS, BARN YARDS, FARM BUILDINGS) AND HAVE LITTLE OR NO EQUIPMENT (SUCH AS TRACTORS). ONE OF AGRABILITY&#39;S STATED PURPOSES IS TO REDUCE SECONDARY INJURIES TO THOSEALREADY LIVING WITH A DISABILITY. WE DESIGNED OUR SYSTEM TO TEACH THEM TO SAFELY DESIGN &AMP; BUILD THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE WITH A PREVENTATIVE EYE TOWARDS REDUCING THE RISK OF SECONDARY INJURIES WHERE THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR (IN THE AREAS STATED ABOVE). PERSISTENT POVERTY MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM HOW TO BUILD THESE SYSTEMS WITH FREE OR LOW-COST, LOCALLY AVAILABLE MATERIALS SUCH AS TIRES AND RAMMED EARTH BUILDING TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW FOR THE FLEXIBILITY OF DESIGN TO ACCOMMODATE NOT JUST AN INDIVIDUAL&#39;S DISABILITIES, BUT THEIR INDIVIDUAL PLAN FOR SUCCESS AT FARMING (I.E., THEIR IAP). AGRABILITY PROVIDES US WITH THE TOOLS TO TEACH THIS SYSTEM. SMALL SCALE FARMING REPRESENTS ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST POWERFUL WAYS TO IMPACT FOOD INSECURITY AND PERSISTENT POVERTY, WHILE ALSO DEVELOPING A LOCAL ECONOMY AND EMPOWERING TRIBAL MEMBERS WITH DISABILITIES TO BUILD A NEW FUTURE. AGRABILITY HELPS US DIRECT TRAINING, TECHNICAL, AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THEM.OUR PROGRAM BROUGHT TOGETHER ASSISTIVE-TECHNOLOGY (AT) RESOURCE PARTNERS (BLACK HILLS WORKS, STATE, TRIBAL AND VETERAN&#39;S AFFAIRS VR PROGRAMS, AND GOODWILL OF THE GREAT PLAINS) WITH RESERVATION BASED, TRIBAL/CULTURAL PARTNERS (ALL-NATIONS CENTER, OLCERI, RE-MEMBER) TO ADAPT AND/OR DEVELOP CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AT BY WORKING TOGETHER ON ASSESSING PARTICIPANT NEEDS AND AT FABRICATION. OUR PROGRAM HAS A NATIVE AMERICAN 3RD PARTY EVALUATOR THAT WILL ENSURE OUR PROGRAM OPERATES IN CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND APPROPRIATE WAYS. LASTLY WE DEVELOPED A RADICAL CONCEPT OF THREE NEW, RESERVATION BASED, INCUBATOR-HUB SITES, SPREAD ACROSS THE RESERVATION TO PROVIDE LANDLESS TRIBAL NEW FARMERS WITH ACCESS TO LAND TO BEGIN THEIR FARMING OPERATION. THESE SITES DOUBLE AS OUR THREE MAIN TEACHING SITES FOR ALL AGRICULTURAL TRAININGS AND AS THE ASSISTIVE-TECHNOLOGY CENTERS FOR THEIR PART OF THE RESERVATION. EACH INCUBATOR-TEACHING SITE CAN ALSO BECOME A FOOD HUB WHERE SURPLUS PRODUCE GROWN BY THESE NEW FARMERS CAN BE AGGREGATED AND DELIVERED TO SCHOOLS, ELDERLY CENTERS, FOOD BANKS AND SHELTERS ACROSS THE RESERVATION.WE ANTICIPATE ASSISTING 30-40 LAKOTA LIVING WITH DISABILITIES TO BECOME NEW TRIBAL FARMERS, AND THAT TOGETHER WITH THE THREE ABOVE INCUBATOR-HUBS, A FOUNDATION WILL BE LAID TO DEVELOP AN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY AND A FARM-TO-SCHOOL COMMUNITY FOOD SYSTEM FOR THE PINE RIDGE RESERVATION. OUR PROGRAM EVALUATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY AN IMPARTIAL, 3RD PARTY, NATIVE AMERICAN EVALUATOR USING INDIGENOUS METHODOLOGIES DEVELOPED FOR WORKING IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES, ENSURING THAT THE WORK WE DO AND THE DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS ARE BOTH DONE IN CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE WAYS THAT WILL RESONATE WITH TRIBAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e4dcf3ad-0730-1e57-249e-8c0f96bb1f40-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20184159028723_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 83116293, "Award ID": "20184159028722", "Award Amount": 723840.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-08-31", "CFDA Number": "10.500", "Description": "AGRABILITY PROVIDES CRITICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENABLE A FARMER WITH A DISABILITY TO CONTINUE WORKING. AN EFFECTIVE AGRABILITY PROGRAM INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT FARMERS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE ENGAGED IN PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE BECOME MORE SUCCESSFUL. STATISTICALLY, PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED. HOWEVER, FARMERS HAVE A CULTURE OF PRIDE THAT MOTIVATES THEM TO CONTINUE WORKING IN SPITE OF PAIN AND DIFFICULTY. THERE IS, ALSO, A NEED FOR ONGOING EDUCATION ON SAFE FARMING PRACTICES TO PREVENT SECONDARY INJURIES. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 80,000 FARM OPERATORS AND 83,000 HIRED FARM WORKERS, INCLUDING MIGRANT/SEASONAL FARM WORKERS IN MICHIGAN. AGRABILITY WILL BE EDUCATING, MARKETING AND NETWORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN AGRICULTURE, THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY, HEALTH CARE AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS NEEDING AGRICULTURE-SPECIFIC DISABILITY SERVICES ARE IDENTIFIED AND AWARE OF THESE SERVICES ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. IT ISIMPORTANT AS PART OF THIS PROCESS TO HAVE ONGOING EVALUATION TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO ASSURE EFFECTIVE PROVISION OF SERVICES.THE MICHIGAN AGRICULTURAL WORK FORCE INCLUDES A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF AGING WORKERS WHO ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF IMPAIRMENT FROM CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGING (E.G. ARTHRITIS, STROKE). ACCORDING TO THE LATEST UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE FOR MICHIGAN THERE WERE 52,194 FARMS, 80,304 FARM OPERATORS AND 83,451 HIRED WORKERS IN MICHIGAN WITH THE AVERAGE AGE OF FARM OPERATORS BEING 55.5 YEARS OLD (57.6 YEARS FOR THE PRINCIPAL OPERATOR). TWENTY-SIX PERCENT OF ALL FARM OPERATORS AND 31% OF THE PRINCIPAL FARM OPERATORS IN MICHIGAN WERE OVER THE AGE OF 65. ANNUALLY, WE ESTIMATE THERE ARE OVER 2000 FARM WORKERS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE ASSISTANCE OF AGRABILITY. THIS ESTIMATE IS DERIVED FROM DATA ON BOTH THE NUMBER OF TRAUMATIC FARM-RELATED INJURIES THAT OCCUR AND THE NUMBER OF DISABILITIES FROM CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS IN THE MICHIGAN POPULATION. BASED ON THE MOST RECENT SURVEY DONE BY THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE (NASS) FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (NIOSH), IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE ANNUAL INCIDENCE OF FARM RELATED INJURIES IS 1.5 PER 100 WORKERS. THIS WOULD EQUATE TO 2,456 FARM RELATED INJURIES EVERY YEAR IN MICHIGAN. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (NIOSH) OCCUPATIONAL INJURY SURVEILLANCE OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE (OISPA) SURVEY REPORTED THAT 5% OF FARM RELATED INJURIES RESULTED IN PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT. THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS (BLS) SURVEY OF EMPLOYERS, WHICH EXCLUDES FARMS WITH 11 OR LESS EMPLOYEES, REPORTED THAT IN 2016 THERE WERE 900 FARM RELATED INJURIES IN MICHIGAN WITH AN INCIDENCE OF 3.7 INJURIES PER 100 FULL TIME WORKERS OF WHICH 600 OF THE INJURIES CAUSED LOST WORK TIME OR RESTRICTED WORK ACTIVITY. THE BLS ESTIMATE IS LESS THAN THE NASS ESTIMATE. THE NASS ESTIMATE IS FROM AN EARLIER TIME PERIOD AND INCLUDES ALL FARMS NOT JUST FARMS WITH EMPLOYEES. PAID EMPLOYEES ARE REPORTED ON 26.1% OF FARMS IN MICHIGAN. TWENTY-SIX PERCENT OF THE NASS ESTIMATE OF 2,140 INJURIES IS 559, WHICH IS CLOSER TO THE BLS ESTIMATE OF 900. APPLYING THE NIOSH ESTIMATE THAT 5% OF AGRICULTURAL INJURIES CAUSE PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT LEADS TO AN ESTIMATE OF 45 (5% OF 900 BLS ESTIMATE OF TOTAL NUMBER OF INJURIES) TO 123 (5% OF 2,456 NIOSH ESTIMATE OF TOTAL NUMBER OF INJURIES) MICHIGAN FARMERS HAVE WORK-RELATED INJURIES EACH YEAR WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM ASSISTANCE FROM THE MICHIGAN AGRABILITY PROGRAM.THE OTHER AND LARGER COMPONENT OF THE TOTAL ESTIMATE OF CLIENTS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SERVICE FROM THE MICHIGAN AGRABILITY PROGRAM IS THE NUMBER OF FARMERS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES OF AGING SUCH AS ARTHRITIS, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, CANCER, COPD, DIABETES, STROKE AND NEUROLOGIC CONDITIONS. GIVEN, MICHIGAN&#39;S AGING FARMER WORKFORCE, THERE IS A LARGE UNMET NEED FOR ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES DEALING WITH INJURIES, ILLNESSES AND DISABLING CONDITIONS. THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DISABILITY IN MICHIGAN IS 14.5%. THE PREVALENCE OF DISABILITY INCREASES DRAMATICALLY WITH AGE; FOR PERSONS 21 TO 64 YEARS OLD THE PREVALENCE IS 13.1%, INCREASING TO 24.7% AMONG 65 TO 74 YEAR OLDS AND TO 49.1% FOR PERSONS WHOSE AGES ARE 75+). THE PERCENTAGE OF 21-64 YEAR OLDS IN MICHIGAN WHO ARE DISABLED IS LARGER THAN THE PREVALENCE OF 10.9% AMONG 21-64 YEAR OLDS IN THE UNITED STATES. EXTRAPOLATING THESE PERCENTAGES TO THE FARM OPERATORS IN MICHIGAN (26% OF WHOM ARE OVER 65), THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 2000 FARM OPERATORS WITH DISABILITIES. DISABILITIES CREATE CHALLENGES IN LIFE. FOR MICHIGAN&#39;S FARMERS, AND FARM WORKERS, DISABILITIES AND CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS CAN TRANSFORM AN ACTIVE, INDEPENDENT LIFESTYLE TO ONE OF UNCERTAINTY, DEPENDENCE, AND ADAPTATION. IN ADDITION TO THE EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL CHALLENGES OF ADAPTING TO A DISABILITY OR SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION, FARM FAMILIES ALSO FACE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. MANY ASK, \"HOW CAN WE CONTINUE FARMING?\" AND EXPECT THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO \"RETHINK\" THEIR LIFESTYLES AND THEIR CAREERS.ENGINEERING/REHABILITATION SERVICES, RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY COSTS ARE VERY HIGH, AND OUTSIDE THE ABILITY OF FARMERS TO SELF-PAY. THE NET RESULT IS THAT MICHIGAN FARMERS EITHER CONTINUE WORKING IN SEVERE PAIN, OVERSTRESSING THEIR BODIES, USING UNSUITABLE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT AND ENDANGERING THEIR FUTURE HEALTH OR ARE FORCED TO STOP WORKING. FOR A FARMER WITH A DISABILITY TO BE RETRAINED AND FIND ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT IN A RURAL COMMUNITY IS VERY DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. THE NATURAL PROGRESSION IS THAT THE FARMER&#39;S HEALTH CONTINUES TO DEGRADE UNTIL HE IS FORCED TO STOP WORKING. AGRABILITY PROVIDES CRITICAL SERVICES BECAUSE MEDICAL INSURANCE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE PLANS DO NOT COVER THE COSTS OF REHABILITATION SERVICES AT THE FARM WORK SITE AND THE ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE A FARMER TO CONTINUE WORKING. DATA FROM THE 2016 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY ESTIMATED THAT THERE WERE 738,700 NONINSTITUTIONALIZED MEN AND WOMEN AGES 21-64 IN MICHIGAN WITH A DISABILITY OF WHOM ONLY 248, 203 (33.6%) WERE EMPLOYED AS COMPARED TO 78.3% OF MEN AND WOMEN AGES 21-64 IN MICHIGAN WITHOUT A DISABILITY WHO WERE EMPLOYED. WORKING-AGE PERSONS WITH A DISABILITY WERE NEARLY THREE TIMES LESS LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED. IN COMPARISON, IN THE UNITED STATES, 36.2% OF 21-64 YEAR OLDS WITH DISABILITIES AND 78.9 % WITHOUT DISABILITIES WERE EMPLOYED (5). IN CONTRAST TO THESE LOW EMPLOYMENT RATES AMONG THE DISABLED ARE THE SHORTAGES OF WORKERS ON MICHIGAN FARMS. MICHIGAN FARM BUREAU BEGAN REPORTING IN OCTOBER 2013 THAT THERE WAS A 10 TO 20% SHORTAGE OF WORKERS TO HELP BRING IN THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE HARVEST. APPLES, ASPARAGUS, STRAWBERRIES AND OTHER CROPS ROTTED IN THE FIELDS IN 2013 BECAUSE OF THE SHORTAGE OF LABOR. THIS PROBLEM HAS CONTINUED WITH A FURTHER REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF MIGRANT WORKERS IN MICHIGAN. AGRICULTURE CAN BE A SOLUTION FOR LOWEMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. A FARMER WHO IS ALREADY EMPLOYED CAN BE HELPED TO KEEP WORKING IN SPITE OF A DISABLING INJURY OR ILLNESS. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WORK CAN BE HELPED TO FIND JOBS ON MICHIGAN FARMS.

MAINE&#39;S 8,173 FARMS ENCOMPASS MORE THAN 1.45 MILLION ACRES OF LAND. THE AVERAGE FARM SIZE IS 178 ACRES, AND FARM CASH RECEIPTS STATEWIDE EXCEED $763 MILLION ANNUALLY, WITH A TOTAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF OVER $1.2 BILLION. MAINE&#39;S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY CONTAINS A RICH MIXTURE OF WHOLESALE AND RETAIL FARM OPERATIONS. MAINTAINING A DIVERSE AND VITAL AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IS ESSENTIAL TO THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE MAINE ECONOMY AS WELL AS TO THE RURAL CHARACTER AND CULTURE OF THE STATE.IN 2012, 16% OF MAINE RESIDENTS HAD ONE OR MORE DISABILITIES. WITH NEARLY 30,000 MAINERS ENGAGED IN SOME ASPECT OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 4,800 FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS IN MAINE HAVE A DISABILITY. WITH A RELATIVELY LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND A COMPARATIVELY SMALL POPULATION, HEALTH CARE AND PREVENTIVE RESOURCES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE IN RURAL, AGRICULTURAL AREAS OF MAINE.

STATE AND FEDERAL VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION (VR) STAFFERS IN MAINE ARE NOT TYPICALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE PHYSICAL CHALLENGES OF FARM WORK AND ARE NOT WELL EQUIPPED TO ACCOMMODATE WORKERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. SIMILARLY, MANY AGRICULTURAL PROFESSIONALS IN MAINE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY (AT) AND AVAILABLE DISABILITY RESOURCES.

THEY KNEW SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WERE IMPORTANT AND PREVENTING INJURIES ON THE FARM WAS CRITICAL, BUT THEY WERE NOT EQUIPPED TO RECOGNIZE THE WIDE RANGE OF DISABILITIES THEY WERE SEEING OR TO THINK IN TERMS OF PROVIDING HELP WITH FARMERS&#39; PERSONAL HEALTH ISSUES. MAINE AGRABILITY HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CAPACITIES OF REHABILITATION, HEALTH AND AGRICULTURAL PROFESSIONALS TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM AND UNDERSTAND HOW MEANINGFUL IT CAN BE TO EFFECTIVELY ASSIST AND ACCOMMODATE FARMERS SO THEY CAN KEEP FARMING.MAINE AGRABILITY WILL CONTINUE TO NETWORK WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE, REACHING AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE AUDIENCE, REVISITING EXISTING NETWORK PARTNERS TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE CAPACITY FOR AGRABILITY WORK.

RENOVATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION ARE NEEDED TO UPGRADE THE FOOD PREPARATION LAB, TEXTILES LAB AND THE PURCHASE OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES IN BENBOW HALL. SIMILARLY, THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT LABORATORY, NEEDS REPAIRS TO ITS INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO ITS CONTINUED OPERATION. THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT LABORATORY WILL EVENTUALLY NEED REPLACING. THE DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL SCIENCES WILL PURCHASE LABORATORY EQUIPMENTS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN CAPITAL FOR THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES, ESPECIALLY THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR.
