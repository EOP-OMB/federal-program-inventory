THIS HAS PROMPTED RESEARCH TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF CERTAIN HERPES VIRUSES AS VACCINE VECTORS, FOCUSING PARTICULARLY ON DISEASES THAT REQUIRE CD8 T CELL RESPONSES FOR IMMUNITY. THE CAPACITY OF CD8 T CELLS TO ACT AS EFFECTORS AGAINST VIRAL INFECTIONS GENERALLY RELIES ON THEIR ABILITY TO RECOGNISE AND RESPOND TO VIRUS-INFECTED CELLS BEFORE THEY PRODUCE LARGE QUANTITIES OF VIRUS.
