WITH A LIFETIME PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL, PHYSICAL AND/OR STALKING RELATED VIOLENCE BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER OF 42.5 PERCENT AMONG HOOSIER WOMEN, IN IS IN THE HIGHEST QUARTILE FOR THESE FORMS OF VIOLENCE NATIONALLY (SMITH, ET AL, 2017). THE PREVALENCE AND IMPACTS OF IPV WERE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN IN PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND STATE DATA COLLECTED SINCE 2020 INDICATE THAT THE PROBLEM IS INCREASING. SURGES IN SERVICE REQUESTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY IN\u2019S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGENCIES, LAW ENFORCEMENT DISPATCH REPORTS, AND 211 CALL CENTERS. MOST ALARMINGLY, THE INDIANA COALITION AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (ICADV) DOCUMENTED A 181 PERCENT INCREASE IN HOMICIDES RELATED TO IPV IN THE 2021 REPORTING PERIOD. THOUGH IPV AFFECTS WHOLE COMMUNITIES, INEQUITIES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS RESULT IN DISPROPORTIONATE EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE AMONG TRADITIONALLY MARGINALIZED IDENTITY GROUPS INCLUDING WOMEN, RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES, SEXUAL MINORITIES, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY, AND RESIDENTS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES. THE DISPARITY IN EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IS A PARTICULAR CONCERN IN IN WHERE 41 OF THE STATE\u2019S 92 COUNTIES ARE DESIGNATED AS RURAL.  TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, ICADV PROPOSES TO PARTNER WITH THE RURAL GRANT COUNTY, INDIANA COMMUNITY TO IMPLEMENT APPROACHES DESIGNED TO MODIFY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) INCLUDING CHANGES TO THE PHYSICAL, ECONOMIC AND NORMATIVE ENVIRONMENTS TO REDUCE RISK FACTORS AND TO INCREASE PROTECTIVE FACTORS RELATED TO IPV. PRIORITY RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS IDENTIFIED FROM STATE AND COMMUNITY DATA INCLUDE POVERTY, GENDER INEQUALITY, TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES, AND COMMUNITY DISCONNECTEDNESS. THE PROJECT\u2019S PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES WILL BE POOR PEOPLE LIVING IN RURAL COMMUNITIES; AND PRIORITY ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO POPULATIONS WITHIN THIS GROUP THAT HAVE BEEN THE LEAST SUPPORTED, INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE PROPOSED APPROACHES INCLUDE: -\tCREATING PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH URBAN GREENING THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THREE PARK PROJECTS LOCATED IN HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES, -\tENGAGING MEN AND BOYS AS ALLIES IN VIOLENCE PREVENTION THROUGH EFFORTS TO PRACTICE AND NORMALIZE ENGAGED FATHERHOOD PRACTICES AMONG GRANT COUNTY FATHERS, AND, -\tSTRENGTHENING WORK/FAMILY SUPPORTS AND ECONOMIC STABILITY THROUGH THE PROMOTION OF WORKPLACE PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS. EACH OF THESE PROJECT AREAS PROMOTE SAFETY, STABILITY AND NURTURANCE AND ALIGN WITH ICADV\u2019S THEORY OF PREVENTION THAT POSTULATES THAT WHERE PEOPLE FEEL CONNECTED, SUPPORTED AND SUFFICIENT, THEY WILL HAVE LESS MOTIVATION TO BEHAVE IN WAYS THAT ARE ABUSIVE, THEY WILL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO OBSERVE MODELS OF SAFE AND RESPECTFUL RELATIONSHIPS, AND THEY WILL ENCOUNTER INCREASED COMMUNITY ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESPONSE TO ABUSIVE BEHAVIORS.  IN ADDITION TO IMPLEMENTING, EVALUATING AND REPORTING ON THESE APPROACHES IN COLLABORATION WITH STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS, THE STATE LEADERSHIP TEAM WILL UPDATE INDIANA\u2019S IPV PREVENTION PLAN. THE PLAN WILL MAXIMIZE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALIGNMENT WITH INDIANA\u2019S SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION PLAN, WILL CREATE AN INVENTORY OF IPV RESOURCES, AND WILL INCLUDE METHODS FOR PROMOTING THE ADOPTION AND SUSTAINABILITY OF DATA-DRIVEN COMMUNITY AND SOCIETY-LEVEL PREVENTION STRATEGIES.

WITH SEVERAL RURAL COUNTIES THAT ARE ON THE UNITED STATES - MEXICO BORDER AND 22 FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES, THESE NATIONAL STATISTICS ARE WRIT LARGE IN ARIZONA. ARIZONA\u2019S HIGH IPV RATES ARE LINKED TO LOW SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND OPPRESSIVE SOCIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEMS. MANY OF THE RISK FACTORS IN THESE COMMUNITIES ARE CORRELATED WITH GENERATIONS OF COLONIZATION AND GENERATIONAL TRAUMA IN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS POVERTY IN RURAL AREAS THAT LEAD TO LOW QUALITY ECONOMIC, HEALTH, AND SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING AGAINST IPV. CONSIDERING THE HIGH-RISK SOCIAL FACTORS FOR IPV IN THESE COMMUNITIES, WE MUST INVEST IN PREVENTATIVE SERVICES FOR IPV IN ARIZONA. THE TARGET POPULATIONS FOR THE PREVENTING VIOLENCE THROUGH HEALTHY COMMUNITIES PROJECT ARE RURAL, SPANISH SPEAKING, AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT IS TO: (A) DEVELOP A STATE LEADERSHIP TEAM TO; (B) CONDUCT A STATE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF PREVENTATIVE SERVICES FOR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE (IPV); (C) USING A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL, EVALUATE AND ASSESS THE RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR IPV IN THESE COMMUNITIES; AND (D) DEVELOP A PROGRAM AND POLICY EFFORTS AT THE STATE AND COMMUNITY LEVELS TO EXPAND IPV PREVENTION IN ARIZONA USING THE RESULTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN.

BETWEEN 2000 AND 2020, THE SUICIDE RATE IN NYS INCREASED 35.6%, FROM 5.9 TO 8.0 PER 100,000 POPULATION, SURPASSING ANNUAL DEATH RATES BY HOMICIDE AND MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. IN 2019 THERE WERE AN ESTIMATED 42,600 SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AMONG NEW YORKERS LEADING TO 22,430 HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS. FROM 2015-2019, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 565,000 NEW YORKERS HAD SUICIDAL THOUGHTS ANNUALLY. THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM IS GREATLY EXPANDED BY THE GRIEF OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE WHO ATTEMPTED OR DIED BY SUICIDE. COVID-19\u2019S ONGOING IMPACT IN NYS ADDS TO THE PROBLEM. AS OF MAY 21, 2022, THERE HAVE BEEN 5,346,809 INFECTIONS AND 55,917 DEATHS RESULTING FROM COVID-19. RESEARCH CONDUCTED DURING THE PANDEMIC REVEALS SIGNS OF BROAD INCREASES IN MENTAL DISTRESS ACROSS THE POPULACE, BUT PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUTH. HOWEVER, COVID-19\u2019S FULL IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE RISK IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. CONTINUED MONITORING ON SUICIDE RISK IS IMPERATIVE. THE NYS OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH (OMH) REQUESTS FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE, MULTI-TIERED APPROACH TO SUICIDE PREVENTION IN ALBANY, RENSSELAER, SARATOGA, AND SCHENECTADY COUNTIES, A FOUR-COUNTY REGION IN THE HEART OF THE NEW YORK\u2019S CAPITAL DISTRICT WHERE SUICIDE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY EXCEED STATE AVERAGES. THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE IS CALLED CAPITAL CONNECT, AS IT AIMS TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SUPPORT AND FOSTER CONNECTION AMONG THE MOST AT-RISK. OMH PROPOSES TARGETING TWO POPULATIONS FOUND TO BE AT PARTICULARLY HIGH-RISK BASED ON NYS SURVEILLANCE DATA: ADOLESCENT GIRLS (AGED 10-19) AND WORKING-AGED MEN (AGED 25-64). OMH WILL UTILIZE A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION WITH THE PRIMARY GOAL OF REDUCING SUICIDE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN THESE DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECTED POPULATIONS BY 10% OVER THE FIVE-YEAR GRANT PERIOD. SECONDARY GOALS INCLUDE INCREASING ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED SUICIDE PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS WITH AN ASSOCIATED REDUCTION IN DISPARITIES WITHIN THE CATCHMENT AREA. THE PROPOSED APPROACH WILL BE RIGOROUSLY EVALUATED WITH A FOCUS ON CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT  AND SUSTAINED IMPACT.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO A) CREATE A MULTI-SECTORAL PARTNERSHIP, B) TO USE EXISTING DATA TO SELECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AT RISK FOR SUICIDE DEATH AND ATTEMPTS, C) TO CREATE AN INVENTORY OF EXISTING SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND IDENTIFY AREAS FOR GROWTH TO REACH VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, D) TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO INCREASE AND EXPAND STRATEGIES IDENTIFIED IN THE CDC TECHNICAL PACKAGE FOR PREVENTING SUICIDE, AND E) TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A COMMUNICATION PLAN TO SHARE RESULTS AND IMPROVE COORDINATION OF PROVIDERS AND RESOURCES WHICH SERVE THE IDENTIFIED POPULATIONS. FURTHER, THIS PROJECT WILL ENSURE RIGOROUS EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUAL SELECTED ACTIVITIES AND THE SUCCESS OF COMPREHENSIVE SUICIDE PREVENTION WHILE BUILDING SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE TO REDUCE SUICIDE MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY THROUGH AN EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH.  THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IDENTIFIED FOR CSP ARE RURAL WISCONSIN MALES AGED 25-64 AND WISCONSIN FEMALES AGED 10-19. THESE TWO POPULATIONS REPRESENT THE HIGHEST RATES OF SUICIDE MORTALITY (DEATH) AND MORBIDITY (ATTEMPTS) RESPECTIVELY ACROSS THE STATE. WISCONSIN WILL SUPPORT PREVENTION FOR RURAL MALES AGED 25-64 BY CREATING PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH ENCOURAGING SAFE STORAGE PRACTICES FOR FIREARMS, PROMOTING CONNECTEDNESS AND REDUCING STIGMA THROUGH PEER NORM PROGRAMS, STRENGTHENING ACCESS AND DELIVERY OF CARE BY COLLABORATING WITH PARTNERS, STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC SUPPORTS BY REDUCING EVICTIONS AND IMPROVING HOUSING STABILITY, AND STRENGTHENING ACCESS AND DELIVERY OF CARE BY IMPROVING TELE-HEALTH SERVICES, ULTIMATELY REDUCING SUICIDE RATES AMONG THIS TARGET POPULATION.  ADDITIONALLY, BY PROMOTING CONNECTEDNESS THROUGH PEER MENTORSHIP, CREATING PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENTS BY EDUCATING PROVIDERS AND PARENTS ON REDUCING ACCESS TO LETHAL MEANS, STRENGTHENING ACCESS AND DELIVERY OF CARE BY SUPPORTING INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTHCARE WITHIN PEDIATRIC SETTINGS, AND TEACHING COPING AND PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS BY IMPROVING FAMILY AND PARENTING RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH EXPANSION OF EXISTING PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT WISCONSIN, RATES OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AMONG WISCONSIN FEMALES AGED 10-19 WILL ALSO BE REDUCED. THE COMBINATION OF THESE STRATEGIES WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE RATES OF SUICIDE DEATH, ATTEMPTS, AND IDEATION; REDUCE RISK FACTORS, AND INCREASE PROTECTIVE FACTORS, WITH THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING A 10% REDUCTION IN MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY AMONG THE TWO TARGETED POPULATIONS. STRONG PARTNERSHIPS EXIST TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK OF ACHIEVING SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION, AND THE WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES IS WELL-POSITIONED TO LEAD THIS PROGRAM THROUGH ITS INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY, AND THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGENCY SUPPORT WHICH PROVIDES NECESSARY EXPERTISE IN DATA ANALYSIS, PROCESS EVALUATION, AND PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION.

THE KENTUCKY DEPARTMENT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH, COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, AND THE KENTUCKY INJURY PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER ARE COLLABORATING TO SUBMIT THIS PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT KENTUCKY ADVANCING VIOLENCE EPIDEMIOLOGY IN REAL-TIME (KY-AVERT). PURPOSE KY-AVERT INTENDS TO IMPROVE THE SURVEILLANCE REGARDLESS OF INTENT OF ALL VIOLENCE RELATED INJURIES (INCLUDING FIREARM, SEXUAL, INTERPERSONAL, YOUTH, INTIMATE PARTNER, INTENTIONAL SELF-DIRECTED, CHILD ABUSE, ETC) AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS OF ED VISITS. THE KY-AVERT TEAM WILL UTILIZE SYNDROMIC DATA AND ED DATA TO IDENTIFY CHANGES IN PATTERNS AND TRENDS IN A TIMELY MANNER AND INCREASE THE REACH OF THIS TIMELY DATA THOUGH DISSEMINATION. DISSEMINATION OF THE TRENDS AND PATTERNS OF VIOLENCE-RELATED AND FIREARM INJURIES AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS TO KEY PARTNERS WILL ALLOW FOR A TIMELIER RESPONSE TO CHANGES AND CREATE MORE TARGETED INTERVENTIONS. OUTCOMES KY-AVERT WILL CREATE A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO INCREASE THE TIMELINESS AND AVAILABILITY OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT FOR ALL FIREARM INJURIES, VIOLENCE-RELATED INJURIES, AND MENTAL HEALTH RELATED CONDITIONS. KY-AVERT WILL WORK WITH KEY PARTNERS TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS TIMELY TO THOSE WORKING ON PREVENTION EFFORTS. CASES WILL BE DEFINED USING THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC)/NATIONAL CENTER FOR INJURY PREVENTION AND CONTROL (NCIPC) SYNDROMIC DEFINITIONS FOR VIOLENCE-RELATE INJURIES, FIREARM INJURIES, AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. DATA WILL BE VALIDATED USING HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA. KY-AVERT WILL ALSO LINK DISCHARGE DATA REQUESTED SPECIFICALLY FROM HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS TO EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS) DATA TO HELP BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BURDEN OF VIOLENCE RELATED INJURIES, FIREARM INJURIES, AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AS WELL AS CREATE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THESE EVENTS.

FIRST, WE AIM TO ESTABLISH A TEAM THAT WILL COMPRISE A PROGRAM COORDINATOR AND VIOLENCE EPIDEMIOLOGIST (PC), A BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, AND A VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAM MANAGER TO INCREASE THE TIMELINESS OF AGGREGATE REPORTING OF VIOLENCE RELATED ED VISITS. WE WILL LEVERAGE OUR STATE\u2019S NSSP ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR THE EARLY NOTIFICATION OF COMMUNITY-BASED EPIDEMICS (ESSENCE) TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF VIOLENCE, IDENTIFY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND POPULATIONS WITHIN ARIZONA THAT ARE EXPERIENCING A HIGH BURDEN AND CHANGES IN IN FREQUENCY OF VIOLENCE-RELATED ED VISITS, AND EXAMINE ADDITIONAL CONTEXT SURROUNDING THESE TYPES OF EVENTS. ARIZONA HAS OVER 100 FACILITIES PARTICIPATING IN SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE (REPRESENTING >90% OF ALL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND ACUTE INPATIENT SETTINGS), REPORTING APPROXIMATELY 10,000 HOSPITAL VISITS PER DAY. SECOND, WE WILL LEVERAGE EXISTING, AND FORGE NEW PARTNERSHIPS, WITH ADHS\u2019 CAPABILITY TO SHARE TIMELY DATA WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO MAXIMIZE TIMELY DATA SHARING VIA EXISTING AND NEW NETWORKS AS WELL AS DYNAMIC DASHBOARDS. ADHS WILL DISSEMINATE FINDINGS IN A TIMELY WAY TO PARTNERS THROUGH EXISTING COLLABORATIVES LIKE THE INJURY PREVENTION ADVISORY COUNCIL (IPAC). ADHS AND IPAC WILL COORDINATE AND FACILITATE A NEW IPAC SUB-GROUP FOCUSED ON REVIEWING, DISCUSSING, AND SYNTHESIZING DATA TO INFORM KEY PRIORITIES FOR EFFORTS. THIRD, WE PROPOSE IMPLEMENTING OPTIONAL ACTIVITY 1 (DATA LINKAGE) BY PARTNERING WITH THE ARIZON A VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM (AZ-VDRS) AT THE ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY\u2019S CENTER FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY SAFETY TO EXPLORE NOVEL WAYS TO LINK VIOLENCE RELATED ED VISIT DATA WITH OTHER SOURCES TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF OUR ED DATA. AS OF 2023, AZ-VDRS HAS AGREEMENTS WITH 71 LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS, REPRESENTING ABOUT 98% OF VIOLENT DEATHS IN ARIZONA.

RIDOH MEETS THE SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA OUTLINED IN THE APPLICATION AND WILL BUILD ON PAST SUCCESSES UTILIZING ED DATA IN ESSENCE TO VALIDATE AND MONITOR THE SYNDROME DEFINITIONS OUTLINED IN THE APPLICATION. THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WILL LEAD TO INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAPID, RELIABLE, GEOGRAPHICALLY-, AND POPULATION-SPECIFIC DATA FOR THE IDENTIFIED SYNDROMES (OUTCOME 1) AND INCREASED USE OF TIMELY AND SPECIFIC DATA (OUTCOMES 2 AND 3). ULTIMATELY, PARTNERS WORKING TO PREVENT VIOLENCE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THESE DATA TO DEVELOP FOCUSED PLANS AND RESPONSE STRATEGIES TO PREVENT VIOLENCE AND IMPROVE WELLBEING AMONG POPULATIONS AT GREATEST RISK (OUTCOME 4). RIDOH ALSO PLANS TO DISSEMINATE DATA TO VARIOUS KEY PARTNERS (STRATEGY 2) AND WILL DEVELOP A DETAILED DISSEMINATION PLAN BY THE END OF YEAR 1. RIDOH PLANS TO UTILIZE LESSONS LEARNED FROM DRUG OVERDOSE PREVENTION TO CREATE AN ALERT SYSTEM FOR PARTNERS AND PLANS TO CREATE AND SHARE A VARIETY OF DISSEMINATION PRODUCT INCLUDING A DATA DASHBOARD, MAPS, AND REPORTS. THESE ACTIVITIES WILL LEAD TO INCREASED REACH OF VIOLENCE SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE FINDINGS (OUTCOME 5) AND INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF SUCCESS STORIES (OUTCOME 6).

VIOLENT DEATH IS AN EPIDEMIC IN LOUISIANA. FROM 2016-2020, ALMOST 6900 INDIVIDUALS IN LOUISIANA LOST THEIR LIVES AS A RESULT OF VIOLENCE. THESE PERSONS LEFT BEHIND FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHOSE LIVES WERE MOST LIKELY FOREVER AFFECTED BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY.

WITH THIS PROPOSAL, THE OPH BFH SEEKS TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE STATE\u2019S MORTALITY AND INJURY SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS AND SUPPORT THE DATA NEEDS OF COLLABORATING PREVENTION PARTNERS THROUGH COLLECTION OF DATA FOR YEARS 2023-2027 UNDER NVDRS OPTION 1. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE LOUISIANA VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM (LA-VDRS) HAS EXPANDED FROM A PILOT PROGRAM OF FOUR PARISHES (COUNTIES) IN 2017 TO A STATEWIDE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM COLLECTING DATA ON VIOLENT DEATHS ACROSS LOUISIANA SINCE 2018. LA-VDRS HAS WORKED TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS AND HAS INCREASED DATA COLLECTION CAPABILITIES. AS OF SPRING OF 2021, THERE ARE 58 CORONERS, 63 SHERIFF\u2019S OFFICES, AND 74 POLICE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDING CASE INFORMATION TO LA-VDRS. THESE PARTNERSHIPS WITH CORONERS OFFICES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE IMPROVED DATA QUALITY AND TIMELINESS OF LA-VDRS DATA, AND WILL ALLOW LOCAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION PARTNERS TO USE CIRCUMSTANTIAL VIOLENT DEATH INFORMATION TO CREATE INTERVENTIONS AND POLICY CHANGES TO DECREASE VIOLENT DEATHS ACROSS THE STATE. OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS THE LA-VDRS PROGRAM HAS MADE OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS ARE CREATING A FULLY ELECTRONIC MONTHLY IMPORT OF NVDRS AND SUDORS CASES INTO SAMS, CREATING INTERNAL TRACKING DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE INCREASED TIMELINESS, DATA QUALITY, AND HAS ALLOWED ABSTRACTORS TO FOCUS OUTREACH ACCORDINGLY, AND BEGAN PUBLISHING NVDRS DATA WITH LOCAL PARTNERS. THE LA-VDRS TEAM PLANS TO BUILD UPON THESE PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO ADVANCES SURVEILLANCE OF VIOLENT DEATH BY IMPROVING DATA QUALITY AND TIMELINESS, MAKING DATA MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO PARTNERS THROUGH DATA USE AGREEMENTS FOR THE REQUEST OF CASE LEVEL LA-VDRS DATA, AND CREATING DATA BRIEFS AND REPORTS TO INFORM VIOLENCE PREVENTION STRATEGIES.

THE CONNECTICUT VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM (CTVDRS) HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY FEDERAL CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) FUNDS FOR THE PAST 8 YEARS, BEGINNING IN 2014. THE CTVDRS COLLECTS PRIMARY VIOLENT DEATH DATA FROM THE CT STATE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, DEATH CERTIFICATE DATA FROM THE STATE OFFICE OF VITAL RECORDS, THE STATE POLICE (CT DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND PUBLIC PROTECTION), AND LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS. VIOLENT DEATH DATA INCLUDE DEATHS DUE TO HOMICIDE, SUICIDE, LEGAL INTERVENTION, AND TERRORISM, UNINTENTIONAL FIREARM DEATHS, AND DEATHS OF UNDETERMINED INTENT. THESE DATA ARE ABSTRACTED AND COMPILED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND SUBMITTED TO THE CDC. DATA RESULTS ARE DISSEMINATED TO STATE PARTNERS AND DISCUSSED WITH THE CTVDRS ADVISORY BOARD BIANNUALLY FOR THEIR FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS.  DATA ANALYSES AND REPORTS: ONCE CTVDRS DATA ARE FINALIZED, THEY ARE READY FOR TREND AND CO-FACTOR ANALYSES BY DPH EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND EXTERNAL PARTNERS. EACH YEAR, CTVDRS DEVELOPS AN ANNUAL REPORT WHICH CONTAINS IN-DEPTH AND MULTI-YEAR INFORMATION ON TYPES OF VIOLENT DEATHS, WEAPONS USED, CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATHS, AND DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS. ONE OF THE INTERESTING PUBLIC HEALTH STUDIES THAT DPH PLANS TO CONDUCT IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS IS TO OBSERVE THE DIFFERENCE IN TRENDS BETWEEN THE PRE-PANDEMIC YEARS, THE ACUTE PANDEMIC YEARS, AND THE POST-PANDEMIC PERIOD. IN THE PAST 8 YEARS, CT HAS EXPERIENCED TWO DISTINCT TIME PERIODS OF VIOLENT DEATH TRENDS, THE PRE-COVID-19 PANDEMIC YEARS (2015-2019) AND THE ACUTE COVID-19 PANDEMIC YEARS (2020-2021). CTVDRS WILL ANALYZE THE TRENDS THAT EMERGE IN THE POST PANDEMIC PERIOD (2022 TO 2027) AND COMPARE THOSE TRENDS TO THE PRE-PANDEMIC AND ACUTE PANDEMIC TIME PERIODS.  PARTNERSHIPS AND DISSEMINATING SURVEILLANCE DATA: THE CTVDRS PROGRAM WILL WORK WITH SUICIDE PREVENTION GROUPS, INCLUDING PROGRAM STAFF FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM AWARDED TO DPH IN 2020, TO FURTHER REDUCE THE SUICIDE RATES WITHIN CT AS WAS SEEN DURING THE ACUTE PANDEMIC PERIOD (SEE BACKGROUND SECTION OF THE PROJECT NARRATIVE).

THE PURPOSE OF THE NMVDRS IS TO COLLECT AND DISSEMINATE ACCURATE AND USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT VIOLENT DEATHS IN NEW MEXICO TO GUIDE EFFECTIVE VIOLENCE PREVENTION PRACTICE AND POLICY WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WITH OUR VIOLENCE PREVENTION PARTNERS. NEW MEXICO HAD THE HIGHEST AGE-ADJUSTED STATE RATE OF VIOLENT DEATHS (E.G., HOMICIDES, SUICIDES, AND LEGAL INTERVENTIONS) IN THE UNITED STATES (US) DURING 2020 AT 35.9 DEATHS PER 100,000 PERSONS, ACCORDING TO CDC\u2019S WONDER. NEW MEXICO HAD THE 11TH HIGHEST AGE-ADJUSTED HOMICIDE RATE AT 10.8 DEATHS PER 100,000 PERSONS, AND THE 4TH HIGHEST AGE-ADJUSTED SUICIDE RATE OF 24.2 DEATHS PER 100,000 PERSONS IN THE US DURING 2020 (WONDER). ACCORDING TO NMVDRS DATA, VIOLENT DEATH AGE-ADJUSTED RATES IN NEW MEXICO WERE 29% HIGHER FOR BLACKS/AFRICAN AMERICANS AND 21% HIGHER RATE FOR AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKAN NATIVES WHEN COMPARED TO NON-HISPANIC WHITES; AND 230% GREATER RATE FOR MEN WHEN COMPARED TO FEMALES BETWEEN 2017 AND 2019. INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN 20-34 YEARS OF AGE IN NEW MEXICO ARE AT GREATEST RISK FOR VIOLENT DEATHS WITH A RATE OF 53 DEATHS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS. NEW MEXICO COUNTIES WITH SOME OF THE GREATEST AGE-ADJUSTED RATES FOR VIOLENT DEATHS FROM 2017-2019 INCLUDE MCKINLEY (49 DEATHS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS), EDDY (47 DEATHS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS), LINCOLN (45 DEATHS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS) AND SAN JUAN (44 DEATHS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS). BOTH MCKINLEY AND SAN JUAN COUNTIES HAVE A STRONG TRIBAL GOVERNMENT PRESENCE PARTLY DUE TO THE \u201cPATCHWORK\u201d NATURE OF THE NAVAJO RESERVATION.

THIS CONTRAST IS GREATEST FOR FIREARM HOMICIDES IN PARTICULAR. PUERTO RICO HOMICIDE RATES ARE THE HIGHEST WHEN COMPARED TO U.S. POPULATIONS. MALE HOMICIDE RATES IN PUERTO RICO REMAIN THE HIGHEST IN COMPARISON TO ALL U.S. POPULATIONS, WHILE FEMALE HOMICIDE RATES IN PUERTO RICO ARE SURPASSED BY RATES IN U.S. BLACK, AND AMERICAN INDIAN POPULATIONS. APPROXIMATELY 90% OF ALL HOMICIDES IN PUERTO RICO OCCUR USING A FIREARM. THE RISK OF FIREARM HOMICIDES IN 2018, IN PUERTO RICO RELATIVE TO THE U.S. WHITE POPULATION WAS 15.6 TIMES GREATER FOR MALES AND 4.3 TIMES FOR FEMALES. SINCE SEPTEMBER 2016, PUERTO RICO PARTICIPATES IN THE NVDRS AND HAS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR ALL VIOLENT DEATHS IN THE ISLAND, INCLUDING THE SMALLER ISLANDS OF VIEQUES AND CULEBRA. THE PUERTO RICO VIOLENT DEATHS REPORTING SYSTEM (PRVDRS) OPERATES UNDER THE PUERTO RICO INSTITUTE OF STATISTICS (PRIS) AND HAS SIGNED COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH THE THREE MAIN SOURCES OF VIOLENT DEATHS INFORMATION: THE BUREAU OF PUERTO RICO POLICE (BPRP), THE INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC SCIENCES (IFS), AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (DOH). THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF A VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM IN PUERTO RICO IS REFLECTED IN THE HIGH INCIDENT COMPLETION RATES FOR THE PERIOD 2017-2020 AS WELL AS, %DC, %CME, %LE, AND % TOXICOLOGY WITH DOCUMENTATION. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THE PRVDRS HAS MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ADDRESS PROJECT CHALLENGES AND ENHANCE PROJECT PERFORMANCE. THE PRVDRS OBTAINED SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING IN YEAR 05 TO IMPROVE THE COLLECTION OF FIREARM DATA FROM ADDITIONAL DATA SOURCES INCLUDING THE CENTER FOR THE COLLECTION, ANALYSIS AND DISSEMINATION OF CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE (CRADIC) AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS, AND THE NATIONAL INTEGRATED BALLISTIC INFORMATION NETWORK (NIBIN) FORENSIC ANALYSIS LOCATED AT THE IFS. WITH THIS PROJECT, THE PRVDRS WAS ABLE TO INCREASE THE QUALITY, TIMELINESS, AND COMPLETENESS NVDRS FIREARM VARIABLES AND ADD FOUR NEW VARIABLES. THE PROPOSED WORK PLAN SEEKS TO IMPROVE THE COLLECTION OF COMPLETE, TIMELY, AND HIGH-QUALITY DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO INFORM VIOLENCE PREVENTION EFFORTS AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE VIOLENT DEATHS IN PUERTO RICO.

TO ACCOMPLISH THESE KEY OUTCOMES, NEVDRS WILL ENGAGE IN FOUR KEY STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES. A.\tFIRST, NEVDRS WILL USE THE CDC CASE DEFINITION TO IDENTIFY VIOLENT DEATHS ON A BIWEEKLY BASIS FROM DEATH CERTIFICATE DATA. THESE DEATHS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: HOMICIDE, SUICIDE, UNINTENTIONAL FIREARM DEATHS, DEATHS OF UNDETERMINED INTENT, AND LEGAL INTERVENTION. DECEDENTS WILL BE ASSIGNED A NEVDRS CASE NUMBER AND NON-IDENTIFIABLE DEATH CERTIFICATE INFORMATION WILL BE ABSTRACTED. MULTIPLE FATALITY INCIDENTS WILL BE LINKED TO EACH OTHER USING INJURY LOCATION, INJURY TIME, AND NARRATIVE INFORMATION FROM THE DEATH CERTIFICATE. LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTS, CORONER REPORTS, AND TOXICOLOGY REPORTS WILL BE REQUESTED FROM APPROPRIATE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. THESE REPORTS WILL BE LINKED WITH THE NEVDRS CASE NUMBER AND ABSTRACTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CDC GUIDANCE. NEVDRS HAS ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY DATA PROVIDERS IN NEBRASKA, ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 90% OF APPLICABLE DEATHS. B.\tSECOND, NEVDRS DATA WILL BE ANALYZED, INTERPRETED, AND DISSEMINATED ANNUALLY TO CHARACTERIZE TRENDS IN VIOLENCE MORTALITY, UNDERSTAND DISPARITIES, AND INFORM VIOLENCE PREVENTION EFFORTS. EFFORTS REGARDING THIS STRATEGY WILL BE MONITORED BY THE NUMBER OF FACTSHEETS, PUBLICATIONS, REPORTS, PRESENTATIONS, AND DATA REQUESTS. EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO FURTHER BOLSTER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WITH THIS GRANT FUNDING. C.\tTHIRD, NEVDRS WILL ENGAGE IN DATA-DRIVEN PLANNING, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION TO SUPPORT CONTINUOUS SURVEILLANCE IMPROVEMENT. THIS WILL INCLUDE REVISITING DATA COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, AND QUALITY FOR INCLUDED VIOLENT DEATH SURVEILLANCE DATA. EACH YEAR SINCE THE INITIAL FUNDING WAS RECEIVED IN 2017, NEVDRS HAS IMPROVED IN THESE CATEGORIES. D.\tFOURTH, NEVDRS WILL EXPAND ON THE CURRENT CAPACITY FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC SCIENCE, GEOCODING, AND CONDUCTING LINKAGE TO DATA WITH INFORMATION ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. TO DO THIS A THOROUGH INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF PROGRAMMATIC CAPABILITIES WILL BE CONDUCTED. FURTHER, COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER KEY AGENCIES WILL BE LEVERAGED TO LINK NEVDRS DATA TO THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM (PDMP), HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA (HDD), AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS) DATA.

THE MASSACHUSETTS VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM (MAVDRS) IS A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR VIOLENT DEATHS OCCURRING IN MASSACHUSETTS AND UTILIZES DATA FROM THE REGISTRY OF VITAL RECORDS AND STATISTICS, THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE, AND THE BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT TO MONITOR, CHARACTERIZE, AND UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING UP TO THESE DEATHS. VIOLENT DEATHS INCLUDE HOMICIDES, SUICIDES, DEATHS OF UNDETERMINED INTENT, LEGAL INTERVENTION DEATHS AND ALL FIREARM FATALITIES. THESE DEATHS ARE A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM IN MASSACHUSETTS AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. IN 2019, MAVDRS IDENTIFIED OVER 880 VIOLENT DEATHS IN MASSACHUSETTS. ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS (72%) OF THESE DEATHS WERE SUICIDES, 17% WERE DUE TO HOMICIDE, AND 10% WERE DEATHS OF UNDETERMINED INTENT. MAVDRS PROVIDES DETAILED INFORMATION ON THESE DEATHS THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE OF A MULTI-SOURCE, LINKED, CASE-LEVEL DATABASE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE MORE IN-DEPTH INFORMATION THAN ANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL DATA SOURCES ALONE.

FOCUS AREA 1 - ACES: THE GEORGIA CORE SIPP TEAM WILL PARTNER WITH THE DPH PREVENTING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES, DATA TO ACTION TEAM, TO ANALYZE ALBANY REGION-SPECIFIC ACE DATA, THEN PRODUCE ANNUAL COMMUNITY ACES AND RESILIENCE DATA REPORTS THAT INFORM COMMUNITY-LEVEL PARENTING SKILLS AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIP PROGRAMS IN THE ALBANY PUBLIC HEALTH DISTRICT.FOCUS AREA 2 ? TRANSPORTATION SAFETY: IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CODES PROGRAM MANAGER AND THE CODES BOARD, THE GA CORE SIPP TEAM WILL CONDUCT A POLICY EVALUATION TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF GEORGIA?S SEAT BELT LAW (O.C.G.A. 40-8-76) ON TRANSPORTATION-RELATED INJURIES FOR CHILD PASSENGERS. SURVEILLANCE PRODUCTS WILL INCLUDE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS, FACT SHEETS, AND OCCUPANT INJURY REPORTS FOR USE BY STAKEHOLDERS. IN ALIGNMENT  WITH THIS ANALYSIS, THE TEAM WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE UTILIZATION OF THE EVIDENCE-INFORMED CHILD PASSENGER SAFETY OBSERVATIONAL SURVEILLANCE TOOL DEVELOPED DURING THE CORE SVIPP 2016-2021 GRANT. FOCUS AREA 3 ? TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY: GEORGIA CORE SIPP WILL USE SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENTIAL RATES OF TBI-RELATED MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, AND RISK FACTORS IN RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS, RURAL COMMUNITIES, AND PEOPLE WHO ARE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED IN CENTRAL GEORGIA, TO BETTER TARGET PREVENTION EFFORTS IN THE NORTH CENTRAL GEORGIA REGION. SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES WILL INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIAL EMPHASIS REPORTS FOR DISSEMINATION TO COMMUNITY AND STATE-LEVEL TBI PARTNERS. FOCUS AREA 4 ? FALLS: GEORGIA CORE SIPP WILL ADDRESS FALLS PREVENTION WITHIN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED COMMUNITIES IN NORTH CENTRAL GEORGIA AND THE VALDOSTA PUBLIC HEALTH DISTRICT. WE BELIEVE A COORDINATED FALL AND TBI PREVENTION EFFORT WITHIN THE SAME NORTH CENTRAL GEORGIA REGION WILL STRENGTHEN THE OUTCOMES FOR REDUCING THE RISK FACTORS AND INCREASING THE PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR FALLS PREVENTION, THROUGH A SRPF LENS. ENHANCED APPLICATION: GA CORE SIPP ENHANCED PROPOSAL WILL BE USED TO STRENGTHEN THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR INJURY PREVENTION THROUGH RIGOROUS EVALUATION AND INNOVATIVE SURVEILLANCE METHODS.

IT DETAILS THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM AND NOTES ITS SUCCESS IN BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS AND DATA SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW US TO FULLY EMBRACE AND PARTICIPATE IN TRUE DATA-TO-ACTION, IN PARTICULAR WITH HARD-TO-REACH POPULATION GROUPS.  THIS APPLICATION DETAILS HOW MDH IVPS PLANS TO STRENGTHEN THREE KEY AREAS: PREVENTING ACES, IMPROVING TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, AND SUPPORTING THE RESPONSE TO TBI-RELATED INJURIES. THE WORK PROPOSED FOLLOWS AN OUTLINE THAT MDH IVPS HAS USED TO SERVE MINNESOTANS FOR MANY YEARS: COLLECT DATA THROUGH EXCELLENT SURVEILLANCE TO LEARN THE PATTERNS OF HEALTH OUTCOMES; SHARE THESE DATA WITH RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS, AGENCIES, AND PEOPLE; WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE EVIDENCE-BASED DECISIONS ABOUT ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE FACTORS IMPACTING THE OUTCOMES; AND EVALUATE THE ACTIONS TO LEARN LESSONS FOR FUTURE PROGRAMMING. THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH KEY ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES, MDH IVPS AIMS TO DECREASE DISPARITIES IN ACES, TRANSPORTATION-RELATED INJURIES, AND TBI INCIDENCE BY EXPLORING SHARED RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS WHICH WILL, IN TURN, PREVENT A MULTITUDE OF OTHER INJURIES.

THE PRVDRS STAFF HAS ESTABLISHED THE PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES TO COLLECT NVDRS STANDARD DATA ELEMENTS ON ALL VIOLENT DEATHS IN PUERTO RICO AND SUBMITS THIS INFORMATION IN DE-IDENTIFIED FORM TO CDC USING A WEB-BASED DATA ENTRY SYSTEM. DATA ELEMENTS ARE COLLECTED FROM THREE SOURCES: DEATH CERTIFICATES, CORONER/MEDICAL EXAMINER REPORTS INCLUDING TOXICOLOGY REPORTS, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTS.ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR IMPLEMENTING AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM OF VIOLENT DEATHS IN PUERTO RICO IS THE HIGH RATES OF HOMICIDES, PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG MALES AND THE USE OF FIREARMS AS THE MAIN MECHANISM OF FATAL INJURY; APPROXIMATELY 9 OUT OF 10 HOMICIDES AMONG MALES OCCUR USING A FIREARM.THIS APPLICATION PROPOSES TO CONTINUE WITH THE STATE WIDE VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM AS RECOMMENDED BY THE CDC?S NVDRS PROGRAM UNDER RFA?S OPTION 1. THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR ALL VIOLENT DEATHS INCIDENTS INCLUDING HOMICIDES, SUICIDES, AND UNINTENTIONAL VIOLENT DEATHS. THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IS OPERATIONAL SINCE 2016 AND IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ADDRESS PROJECT CHALLENGES AND ENHANCE PROJECT PERFORMANCE INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ELECTRONIC DATA COLLECTION FROM THE PUERTO RICO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH VITAL STATISTICS OFFICE AND THE PUERTO RICO POLICE BUREAU?S (PRPB) MONTHLY HOMICIDE BRIEF REPORT, AND IMPROVE FIREARMS DATA QUALITY AND COMPLETENESS.THE INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC SCIENCES (IFS) IS THE SOLE INSTITUTION THAT CARRIES OUT FORENSIC INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDING MEDICAL-LEGAL, TOXICOLOGY, AND CRIMINAL LABORATORY ANALYSIS THROUGHOUT ALL OF PUERTO RI CO AND IS CENTRALIZED IN THEIR MAIN OFFICE IN SAN JUAN. SIMILARLY, THE PRPB IS THE PRINCIPAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING ALL VIOLENT DEATHS. FINALLY, DEATH CERTIFICATES ARE REGISTERED AT PUERTO RICO?S DEMOGRAPHIC REGISTER WHICH IS A COMPONENT UNIT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (DOH).THE OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF WORK SUCH THAT PRVDRS CONTINUE TO MEET NVDRS DATA QUALITY STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR PUBLICATION IN NVDRS REPORTS. THE PROPOSED OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES AIM FOR THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE TIMELINESS AND COMPLETENESS IN CASE FINDING, CASE REPORTING AS WELL AS QUALITY OF DATA OBTAINED FROM THE THREE KEY SOURCES OF INFORMATION: IFS, PRPB AND DOH.

FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS, BFH HAS MANAGED FETAL, INFANT, CHILD, AND MATERNAL MORTALITY AND INJURY SURVEILLANCE, THE PAST FIVE OF WHICH HAS INCLUDED THE NATIONAL VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM (NVDRS) PROGRAM. VIOLENT DEATH IS AN EPIDEMIC IN LOUISIANA. FROM 2015-2019, ALMOST 6700 INDIVIDUALS IN LOUISIANA LOST THEIR LIVES AS A RESULT OF VIOLENCE. THESE PERSONS LEFT BEHIND FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHOSE LIVES WERE MOST LIKELY FOREVER AFFECTED BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY.    PARTICIPATION IN THE NVDRS HAS PROVIDED LOUISIANA WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON PAST INJURY AND MORTALITY WORK, FURTHER STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, AND CAPITALIZE ON THE HIGH LEVEL OF STATE ATTENTION ON IMPROVING LOUISIANA?S ABILITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF VIOLENCE ON OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH THIS PROPOSAL, THE OPH BFH SEEKS TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE STATE?S MORTALITY AND INJURY SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS AND SUPPORT THE DATA NEEDS OF COLLABORATING PREVENTION PARTNERS THROUGH NVDRS OPTION 1.   OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE LOUISIANA VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM (LA-VDRS) HAS EXPANDED FROM A PILOT PROGRAM OF FOUR PARISHES (COUNTIES) IN 2017 TO A STATEWIDE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM COLLECTING DATA ON VIOLENT DEATHS ACROSS LOUISIANA SINCE 2018. LA-VDRS HAS WORKED TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS AND HAS INCREASED DATA COLLECTION CAPABILITIES. AS OF SPRING OF 2021, THERE ARE 52 CORONERS, 53 SHERIFF?S OFFICES, AND 39 POLICE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDING CASE INFORMATION TO LA-VDRS. THESE PARTNERSHIPS WITH CORONER OFFICES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE IMPROVED DATA QUALITY AND TIMELINESS OF LA-VDRS DATA, AND WILL ALLOW LOCAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION PARTNERS TO USE CIRCUMSTANTIAL VIOLENT DEATH INFORMATION TO CREATE INTERVENTIONS AND POLICY CHANGES TO DECREASE VIOLENT DEATHS ACROSS THE STATE.  OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS THE LA-VDRS PROGRAM HAS MADE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS ARE CREATING A FULLY ELECTRONIC MONTHLY IMPORT OF NVDRS AND SUDORS CASES INTO SAMS, CREATING INTERNAL TRACKING DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE INCREASED TIMELINESS, DATA QUALITY, AND HAS ALLOWED ABSTRACTORS TO FOCUS OUTREACH ACCORDINGLY, AND BEGAN PUBLISHING NVDRS DATA WITH LOCAL PARTNERS.   THE LA-VDRS TEAM PLANS TO USE ANOTHER YEAR OF NVDRS FUNDING TO CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON THESE PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS BY PROVIDING CORONERS OFFICES WITH ACCESS TO MEDICOLEGAL DEATH INVESTIGATION SOFTWARE (MDILOG) TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE DATA QUALITY AND TIMELINESS, MAKING DATA MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO PARTNERS THROUGH FINALIZING DATA USE AGREEMENTS FOR THE REQUEST OF CASE LEVEL LA-VDRS DATA, AND CREATING DATA BRIEFS AND REPORTS TO INFORM VIOLENCE PREVENTION STRATEGIES.    BFH?S EXPERIENCE AS THE STATE LEADER AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNER IN MORTALITY SURVEILLANCE, TRANSLATION OF DATA TO ACTION, MANAGEMENT OF MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL GRANTS, COMMITMENT OF LEADERSHIP TO IMPROVING INFORMATION SUPPORTING PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS, AND EXPERIENCE WITH THE PAST FIVE YEARS OF NVDRS FUNDING ARE THE SOLID FOUNDATION FOR CONTINUING TO RUN THE LA-VDRS PROGRAM.

A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT, THE SAFE, EQUITABLE, AND THRIVING TASKFORCE, RESPONDED TO THE DEATH OF A YOUNG TEEN IN 2015, AND PUBLISHED A REPORT OUTLINING FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO YOUTH VIOLENCE IN CEDAR RAPIDS. IN THE 2018 LINN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT, COMMUNITY SAFETY EMERGED AS A TOP HEALTH ISSUE, AND WAS PRIORITIZED AS ONE OF THE THREE TOP HEALTH ISSUES FOR THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A VISION FOR HEALTH. MUCH LIKE THE REST OF THE NATION, IN CEDAR RAPIDS AND LINN COUNTY, BLACK YOUTH AGES 14-24 ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY YOUTH VIOLENCE. RACIAL INEQUITIES ACROSS EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, INCOME, EMPLOYMENT, AND NEIGHBORHOOD POVERTY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISPROPORTIONAL RATES OF YOUTH VIOLENCE. IOWA RANKS 2ND HIGHEST IN THE UNITED STATES IN BLACK HOMICIDES AT A RATE OF 35.56 PER 100,000. IN CEDAR RAPIDS, BLACK, MALE, YOUTH ARE VICTIMIZED BY GUN VIOLENCE AT A RATE 48.9 TIMES THAT OF THEIR WHITE PEERS. FOR THAT REASON, BLACK YOUTH ARE THE PRIMARY POPULATION OF FOCUS FOR THE SAFE, EQUITABLE AND THRIVING YOUTH AND COMMUNITIES PROJECT. THE SAFE, EQUITABLE AND THRIVING YOUTH AND COMMUNITIES PROJECT BUILDS ON CURRENT VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY CARE COORDINATION INITIATIVES WITHIN CEDAR RAPIDS AND LINN COUNTY IOWA TO ADDRESS RACISM AND YOUTH VIOLENCE AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT INCLUDE FOCUSING ON TWO SOCIETAL LEVEL PREVENTION STRATEGIES, IN COMBINATION WITH A STRATEGY TO MAINTAIN INDIVIDUAL AND INTERPERSONAL LEVEL PREVENTION, WHILE FOCUSING ON ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND HEALTH INEQUITIES TO REDUCE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO YOUTH VIOLENCE. THE PROJECT BUILDS UPON STRONG COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WITH A SHARED VISION FOR HEALTH. ALL THREE STRATEGIES ARE EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES THAT REDUCE YOUTH VIOLENCE PERPET RATION AND/OR VICTIMIZATION OR REDUCE RISK FACTORS OR INCREASE PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR YOUTH VIOLENCE. THE FIRST OF TWO SOCIETAL LEVEL PREVENTION STRATEGIES UTILIZES THE EVIDENCE-BASED PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL GROUP VIOLENCE INTERVENTION TO CREATE PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENTS BY PERFORMING STREET OUTREACH AND CHANGE COMMUNITY NORMS ABOUT VIOLENCE. GROUP VIOLENCE INTERVENTION IS A MODEL WHICH USES A COMBINATION OF FOCUSED DETERRENCE AND COMPREHENSIVE GUN VIOLENCE REDUCTION STRATEGIES. THE SECOND SOCIETAL LEVEL PREVENTION STRATEGY FOCUSES ON IMPLEMENTING PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS TO PROMOTE SOCIAL NORMS THAT PROTECT AGAINST VIOLENCE AND ADVERSITY. THIS STRATEGY BUILDS COMMUNITY CONNECTEDNESS, COHESION, AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCY TO INCREASE PROTECTIVE FACTORS OF VIOLENCE.  THE THIRD STRATEGY PROVIDES INDIVIDUAL AND INTERPERSONAL EVIDENCE-BASED PREVENTION TO AT-RISK YOUTH AND FAMILIES TO LESSEN IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM HARMS OF TRAUMA SUCH AS VIOLENCE EXPOSURES AND PREVENT FUTURE RISK OF PERPETRATION AND VICTIMIZATION OF VIOLENCE. THE INTENDED OUTCOMES OF ALL THREE STRATEGIES IMPLEMENTED TOGETHER ARE DECREASES IN ACCEPTABILITY OF USING GUNS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, NUMBER OF SHOTS FIRED, WEAPONS (GUN) CHARGES FOR YOUTH, VIOLENT CRIME RATE, FIREARM-RELATED DEATHS, AND YOUTH HOMICIDE. ADDITIONALLY, INCREASES IN UTILIZATION OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AMONG AT-RISK POPULATION, STABILITY OF FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS, NORMATIVE BELIEFS THAT VIOLENCE IS UNACCEPTABLE, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND CONNECTEDNESS, AWARENESS OF THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND RACIAL INEQUITY ON VIOLENCE, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF CEDAR RAPIDS CITIZENS REPORTING AN OVERALL FEELING OF SAFETY ARE EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THIS PROJECT.

HOWEVER, THOSE MEASURES BELIE SIGNIFICANT RACIAL DISPARITIES. IN MINNESOTA, PEOPLE OF COLOR FACE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE OUTCOMES IN MANY AREAS. AS THE STATE?S LARGEST CITY, MINNEAPOLIS HAS A ROLE IN DRIVING THOSE RACIAL DISPARITIES. COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE STATE, MINNEAPOLIS ALSO EXPERIENCES HIGHER LEVELS OF VIOLENT CRIME. WITHIN MINNEAPOLIS, THE BURDEN OF VIOLENCE BECOMES EVEN MORE DISPROPORTIONATE BASED ON GEOGRAPHY AND RACE. MINNEAPOLIS YOUTH ARE DEEPLY IMPACTED BY THIS. IN 2019, HOMICIDE ACCOUNTED FOR 39% OF DEATHS AMONG YOUTH AGE 15 TO 25 IN MINNEAPOLIS. PREVAYL PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY-LEVEL APPROACHES TO PREVENTING MULTIPLE FORMS OF VIOLENCE. IT ALSO PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRITICALLY CONSIDER THE INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN RACIAL INEQUITY AND VIOLENCE.   THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON ADDRESSING VIOLENCE IMPACTING YOUNG PEOPLE AGES 10-24 LIVING IN MINNEAPOLIS. ADDITIONAL FOCUS WILL BE ON YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING IN PARTS OF NORTH AND CENTRAL/SOUTH MINNEAPOLIS WHERE THE BURDEN OF VIOLENCE AND POVERTY ARE THE HIGHEST.
