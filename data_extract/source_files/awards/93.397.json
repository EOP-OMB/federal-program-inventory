THE PAVILION THEME IS RESEARCH OF UNDERSTUDIED, VIRUS-ASSOCIATED TUMORS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT MEN AND WOMEN LIVING WITH HIV IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). SSA REMAINS HOME TO TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH). HIV-RELATED IMMUNOSUPPRESSION RESULTS IN AN INABILITY TO CONTROL VIRUSES AND THEREFORE A HIGHER RISK OF VIRUS-ASSOCIATED CANCER, EVEN AMONG PLWH ON EFFECTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY. THE INCREASING LIFE-EXPECTANCY OF PLWH COMPOUNDS THIS CANCER RISK AS CANCER IS NOW A LEADING CAUSE OF MORTALITY AMONG PLWH IN BOTH HIGH AND LOW RESOURCE COUNTRIES. FURTHERMORE, PLWH EXPERIENCE POORER CANCER TREATMENT OUTCOMES. DESPITE THIS, FEW STUDIES OF CANCER ETIOLOGY AND CANCER OUTCOMES AMONG PLWH IN LMICS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED, WITH LITTLE FOCUS ON HPV CANCERS AT EXTRA-CERVICAL ANATOMIC SITES AND VERY FEW STUDIES OF A SUSPECTED VIRAL ETIOLOGY FOR CONJUNCTIVAL TUMORS. PAVILION WILL THEREFORE FOCUS ON THE FULL RANGE OF CANCERS CAUSED BY HPV (ANAL, CERVICAL, OROPHARYNGEAL, PENILE, AND VULVAR CANCERS) AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF EBV IN CONJUNCTIVAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA - CANCERS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONALITY HIGHER AMONG PLWH, AND WHICH RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY.

ANALYSIS OF RETROSPECTIVE CLINICAL DATA COUPLED WITH IN VIVO THERAPEUTIC MODELING USING SYNGENEIC MODELS OF MURINE MELANOMA STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS CONCEPT. IN FACT, THE PICTURE THAT HAS EMERGED IN MELANOMA IS THAT IMMUNE FACTORS CAN PLAY A STRONG ROLE IN DRIVING RESISTANCE TO MAPK INHIBITOR (MAPKI) THERAPY, AND THAT LEAD-IN IMMUNE CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE (ICB) CAN \u2018PRIME\u2019 BOTH THE PRIMARY TUMOR AND DISTAL METASTASES (INCLUDING BRAIN METASTASES) FOR ERADICATION WHEN THE IT IS SUBSEQUENTLY COMBINED WITH MAPKI.

YET, THERE IS A PARADOX SURROUNDING THE ROLE OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN PROSTATE CANCER: \u201cTHE INFLAMMATION PARADOX\u201d. ON ONE HAND, INFLAMMATION MAY BE A DRIVER OF CARCINOGENESIS. ON THE OTHER, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS KNOWN TO SEEK AND DESTROY CANCER CELLS. THE MAJORITY PROSTATE CANCER LESIONS ARE \u201cIMMUNE DESERTS\u201d, AND ICIS ARE INEFFECTIVE IN MOST CASES. WHY IS THERE AN EVIDENTLY STRONG IMMUNE REACTION IN NON- NEOPLASTIC REGIONS IN PIA, BUT A LACK OF A ROBUST IMMUNE RESPONSE IN MOST PROSTATE CANCERS?

IN THE TECH UNITS OF THE JOHNS HOPKINS CENTER FOR 3D MULTISCALE CANCER IMAGING, WE WILL DEVELOP A VERSATILE 3D MULTISCALE IMAGING METHOD, CODA, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO PROBE THE PHENOTYPIC HETEROGENEITY OF TUMORS FROM THE MULTI-CM TO THE MICRON SCALE VIA MULTIPLEXING SERIAL IMAGING. CODA CAN READILY INCORPORATE OTHER IMAGING MODALITIES TO EXTRACT HIGH CELLULAR/MOLECULAR CONTENT FROM 3D SAMPLES. THESE INCLUDE IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY (CODA+IHC), IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE (CODA+IF), IMAGING MASS CYTOMETRY (CODA+IMC) AND SPATIAL TRANSCRIPTOMICS/PROTEOMICS (CODA+DBIT-SEQ). THESE PROPOSED EXPANDED VERSIONS OF CODA OFFER A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE NEW 3D MULTI-OMIC MAPS OF HUMAN PDAC AND BREAST TUMORS NEAR AND FAR FROM BLOOD VESSELS. CODA AND ITS INTEGRATED VERSIONS CODA+X WILL BE TESTED IN THE RTB UNITS OF THE CENTER IN BOTH HUMAN/MOUSE TISSUE SAMPLES AND ORGANOIDS, IN BREAST AND PANCREATIC CANCER.

"93.397", "Description": "BMP-DEPENDENT PATHWAYS AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE - SUMMARY AMONGST LIPIDS THAT REGULATE INTRACELLULAR TRANSPORT ROUTES, BIS(MONOACYLGLYCEROL)PHOSPHATE (BMP) IS UNIQUELY LOCATED TO MULTIVESICULAR BODIES (MVBS) AND LATE ENDOSOMES/LYSOSOMES (LE/LYS), WHERE IT CONTROLS INTRA-LUMENAL VESICLES (ILVS) FORMATION. UPON FUSION OF MVBS WITH THE MEMBRANE, ILVS WILL BECOME EXOSOMES. BMP THUS REGULATES THE CORRECT ADDRESSING OF CARGOES TO RECYCLING, LYSOSOMAL DEGRADATION OR EXTRACELLULAR EXOSOMAL EXPORT. PATHWAYS REGULATED BY BMP ARE PROFOUNDLY ALTERED IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES AND LEVELS OF BMP ARE MODIFIED IN THESE DISORDERS -E.G., IN HUMAN AUTOPSY BRAIN SAMPLES OF LATE ONSET ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE (LOAD). THE ABILITY TO MODULATE BMP LEVELS WOULD OPEN NEW PERSPECTIVES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATHOGENESIS OF THESE DISORDERS AND COULD PROVIDE NEW THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS. THE KEY OBSTACLE TO THIS APPROACH IS THAT THE ENZYMES REGULATING BMP BIOSYNTHESIS WERE SO FAR UNKNOWN. OUR LAB RECENTLY IDENTIFIED AN ENZYME WITH PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 (PLA2) ACTIVITY -HEREAFTER PLA2- REGULATING THE LIMITING STEP OF BMP SYNTHESIS IN LIPOSOMES AND IN HELA CELL LINES. HERE WE PROPOSE THAT MODULATING PLA2 LEVELS AND ACCOMPANYING BMP LEVELS COULD BE AN ATTRACTIVE STRATEGY TO MODIFY PATHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN LOAD. HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE THAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PLA2 FUNCTION AND LOCALIZATION IN THE BRAIN. IN AIM 1, WE WILL TEST THE EXISTENCE OF A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN PLA2 PROTEIN LEVELS AND LOAD PATHOLOGY IN HUMAN AUTOPSY BRAIN SAMPLES. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL USE FROZEN SAMPLES FROM ENTORHINAL CORTEX, HIPPOCAMPUS, PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND CEREBELLUM OF PATIENTS WITH SEVERE OR MILD LOAD AND COMPARE THEM WITH UNAFFECTED CONTROL INDIVIDUALS. USING A COMBINATION OF WESTERN BLOT AND LIPIDOMICS, WE WILL TEST (I) IF PROTEIN LEVELS OF PLA2 ARE MODIFIED IN PATHOLOGY-PRONE BRAIN REGIONS OF LOAD PATIENTS COMPARED TO CONTROLS, (II) IF PROTEIN LEVELS OF PLA2 CORRELATE WITH DISEASE PROGRESSION AND (III) IF BMP LEVELS CORRELATE WITH PLA2 LEVELS. IN AIM 2, WE WILL GATHER EVIDENCE PERTAINING TO THE MOST DISEASE-RELEVANT BRAIN CELL TYPE AND BIOLOGICAL OUTCOMES TO TARGET IN A FUTURE DISEASE-MODIFYING STRATEGY. WE WILL FIRST IDENTIFY THE BRAIN CELL TYPE LOCALIZATION OF THE PLA2 PROTEIN, USING CO-STAINING FOR PLA2 AND DIFFERENT CELL TYPE MARKERS IN CONTROL HUMAN AUTOPSY BRAIN SAMPLES SECTIONS, IN WILD- TYPE MOUSE BRAIN SECTIONS AND IN MICROGLIA/ASTROCYTE/NEURON PRIMARY TRI-CULTURES.

DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS, MOST PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED MELANOMA DO NOT BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT, WHILE THE MOST POTENT THERAPIES OF MELANOMA ALSO CAUSE SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE STILL NEED SAFE, EFFICIENT, AND COST-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES OF CSCCS IN IMMUNOCOMPETENT AND IMMUNODEFICIENT PATIENTS THAT COULD TRANSFORM TREATMENT AND OUTCOMES FOR THESE AT-RISK PATIENT POPULATIONS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE MELANOMA AND SKIN CANCER PROGRAM (MSCP SPORE) IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH TO OVERCOME THE HURDLES OF CURRENT THERAPIES OF MELANOMA AND CSCCS. EACH OF THE THREE PROJECTS RESULTS FROM SEMINAL AND INNOVATIVE FINDINGS MADE BY THE INVESTIGATORS OF THE MSCP SPORE, WHICH ARE TRANSLATED INTO NEW COMBINATORIAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TRIALS FOR PATIENTS WITH MELANOMA AND SKIN CANCERS. PROJECT 1 WILL ASSESS THE CLINICAL AND IMMUNOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF ANTI-LAG3 ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH ANTI-PD1, FOR THE FIRST TIME, IN TREATMENT-NA\u00cfVE MPS WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED PRIOR ICB.

DEVELOPMENT, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND ABILITY TO ENHANCE ITS IMPACT ON THE CATCHMENT AREA (CA), THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA HEALTH CANCER CENTER (UFHCC) SEEKS NCI-DESIGNATION. UFHCC IS A MATRIX CENTER THAT SUPPORTS CANCER RESEARCH AND CAREER ENHANCEMENT ACROSS ALL 6 UF HEALTH SCIENCES COLLEGES (DENTISTRY, MEDICINE, NURSING, PHARMACY, PUBLIC HEALTH & HEALTH PROFESSIONS, AND VETERINARY MED) AND 5 OTHER UF COLLEGES (AGRICULTURE, ENGINEERING, HEALTH & HUMAN PERFORMANCE, JOURNALISM & COMMUNICATIONS, AND LIBERAL ARTS & SCIENCES). COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED BY 147 MEMBERS ACROSS 3 UFHCC SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMS: MECHANISMS OF ONCOGENESIS, CANCER THERAPEUTICS AND HOST RESPONSE, AND CANCER CONTROL AND POPULATION SCIENCES. THE UFHCC PROVIDES ACCESS TO STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGIES AND RESEARCH EXPERTISE FOR ITS MEMBERS THROUGH 3 SHARED RESOURCES: BIOSTATISTICS AND QUANTITATIVE SCIENCES, FLOW CYTOMETRY AND CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY, AND NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING. THE UFHCC CA INCLUDES 23 CONTIGUOUS COUNTIES IN NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA SPANNING ~17,500 MI2, ABOUT THE SIZE OF SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND. MOST OF THE COUNTIES (16) ARE RURAL AND EVERY COUNTY IS CLASSIFIED AS A MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA. THE CA POPULATION IS 2.2M AND INCLUDES PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK (16%), HISPANIC (10%), AND HAS THE HIGHEST FRACTION (23%) OF RESIDENTS =65 YEARS IN FLORIDA. THROUGH COMMUNITY OUTREACH, UFHCC SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO INCREASE HEALTH LITERACY, PREVENTION, SCREENING, AND RESEARCH ENGAGEMENT. THE UFHCC CLINICAL RESEARCH OFFICE COORDINATES ALL CANCER-RELEVANT CLINICAL RESEARCH AT UF, WHICH INCLUDES A STATE-WIDE CLINICAL TRIAL NETWORK. IITS ARE FACILITATED THROUGH DISEASE SITE GROUPS WITH AN IIT THINK TANK THAT FOSTERS CLINICIAN COLLABORATION WITH BASIC AND POPULATION SCIENTISTS. UFHCC INNOVATIONS TRANSLATED TO THE CLINIC INCLUDE TARGETED THERAPIES, NOVEL IMMUNOTHERAPIES, THERAPEUTIC MODULATION OF THE MICROBIOME, AND NEW STRATEGIES TO COMMUNICATE WITH PATIENTS. UFHCC DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS SEED EARLY-STAGE RESEARCH, SUPPORT RECRUITMENT OF NEW FACULTY, AND BUILD TRANSDISCIPLINARY TEAMS. UFHCC OFFERS INCLUSIVE RESEARCH CAREER ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS ACROSS THE LEARNER SPECTRUM. SINCE 2016, THE UFHCC RECRUITED 58 NEW MEMBERS (45 EXTERNAL, 39 EARLY-STAGE) (45% WOMEN, 17% URM). PEER-REVIEWED FUNDING INCREASED FROM $21M IN 2016 TO $32.6M/YR IN 2021 (UP 55%); NCI $9.6M TO $13.2M (UP 37%). ACCRUALS TO ALL INTERVENTIONAL TRIALS ROSE FROM 515 IN 2016 TO 1,748 IN 2021 (UP 3.4-FOLD). INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT OF A $32M/YEAR BUDGET OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS AND 44,000FT2 OF NEW RESEARCH SPACE WILL ALLOW UFHCC TO EXPAND. THE NEW UFHCC STRATEGIC PLAN, MOMENTUM 2027, HAS 4 PILLARS: 1) CONDUCT TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH (RNA BIOLOGY, MICROBIOME); 2) TRANSLATE UFHCC DISCOVERIES TO TRIALS (IMMUNOTHERAPY, SMALL MOLECULES, CANCER COMMUNICATION); 3) ADDRESS CANCER BURDEN (CANCER AND AGING, CANCER HEALTH DISPARITIES); AND, 4) TRAIN A PREPARED AND DIVERSE CANCER RESEARCH WORKFORCE, INCLUDING LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT. UFHCC IS POISED TO MAKE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE CANCER BURDEN OF THE CATCHMENT AREA, FLORIDA, AND BEYOND.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19

- PROJECT SUMMARY \u2013 TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH IN 2019, THE US ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO END THE HIV EPIDEMIC BY 2030. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, STRATEGIES THAT IMPROVE HIV PREVENTION AND HIV TREATMENT OUTCOMES ARE NEEDED. ONLY 56% OF PEOPLE WITH HIV (PWH) WERE VIRALLY SUPPRESSED IN 2018, A CRITICAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH OUTCOMES AND TRANSMISSION RISK, AND 51% OF HIV DIAGNOSES IN 2018 WERE IN THE US SOUTH, DESPITE CONSTITUTING ONLY 38% OF THE POPULATION IN THE US. TEXAS IS THE SECOND MOST POPULOUS STATE IN THE US, BEHIND CALIFORNIA, WITH ABOUT 29 MILLION RESIDENTS, AND IS IN THE US SOUTH AS DEFINED BY CDC AND THE CENSUS BUREAU. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS LARGE TEXAS POPULATION, COUPLED WITH WEAKER PUBLIC HEALTH AND PREVENTION POLICIES AND FUNDING ACROSS THE US SOUTH, HAS A GROWING HIV POPULATION THAT LAGS IN CRITICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH AND RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE TO COMBAT THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE US SOUTH AND SPECIFICALLY IN TEXAS TO BOTH CONTRIBUTE TO ENDING THE US HIV EPIDEMIC AND TO LEARN HOW TO BEST DO THAT IN RESOURCE CONSTRAINED AREAS OF THE US. WE THEREFORE WILL ESTABLISH A TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH (D-CFAR) TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL MISSION OF THE NATIONAL CFAR PROGRAM BY FACILITATING HIGH-PRIORITY HIV RESEARCH AND SUPPORTING THE EFFORT TO END THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE US. THREE INSTITUTIONS HAVE COLLABORATED TO PROPOSE THIS D-CFAR: BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN HOUSTON, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER AT HOUSTON AND THE TEXAS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN SAN ANTONIO. BASED UPON THE OUTSTANDING EXPERTISE OF ITS INVESTIGATORS, THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL FOCUS ITS ACTIVITIES IN THE FIVE-YEAR FUNDING PERIOD ON THE RESEARCH THEME \u201cENDING HIV AND OPTIMIZING HIV HEALTH IN TEXAS.\u201d TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GOALS, THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL: 1) PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND FACILITATE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS THAT STRENGTHEN AND ENRICH THE D-CFAR RESEARCH AND INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT; 2) SUPPORT TARGETED HIGH-PRIORITY INTERDISCIPLINARY PILOT RESEARCH PROJECTS, ASSIST IN RESPONDING TO NEW HIV-RELATED RESEARCH INITIATIVES, AND FACILITATE RESEARCH ON ENDING HIV AND IMPROVING HEALTH OF PWH IN TEXAS; AND 3) PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART EXPERTISE, ADVICE, AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE THE RANGE OF HIV-RELATED RESEARCH FOR D-CFAR INVESTIGATORS. THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL SUPPORT AN ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, A DEVELOPMENTAL CORE, A BASIC SCIENCE CORE AND A CLINICAL AND BIOSTATISTICS CORE TO MEET INVESTIGATOR NEEDS AND CATALYZE INNOVATIVE RESEARCH. THE SCIENTIFIC CORES WILL BUILD ON OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS IN VIROLOGY, NON-HUMAN PRIMATE RESOURCES, CLINICAL TRIALS RESEARCH AND BIOSTATISTICS. THE D-CFAR WILL ENGAGE A COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ADVISORY BOARDS FOR GUIDANCE. COUPLED WITH OUTSTANDING INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, THE D- CFAR WILL STIMULATE NEW RESEARCH AND COLLABORATIONS AMONG BASIC, TRANSLATIONAL, CLINICAL, HEALTH SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS. THE D-CFAR WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO END HIV AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF PWH IN TEXAS AND SIMILAR AREAS, TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS, AND GROW INTO A FULL CFAR, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO ENDING THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN TEXAS, THE US SOUTH, AND BEYOND.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ddcd398f-5e59-e840-2368-a57b84efdc7d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_P30AI161943_7529"}, {"internal_id": 147873522, "Award ID": "P30AI152501", "Award Amount": 6215137.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-08", "CFDA Number": "93.855", "Description": "UCLA-CDU CFAR - OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: THIS APPLICATION IS A RESUBMISSION FOR A NEW CFAR THAT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN UCLA AND CDU.

THE UCLA-CDU CFAR WILL STRENGTHEN AND AMPLIFY THE IMPACT OF EXISTING RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND LAUNCH NEW PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS LOS ANGELES AND GLOBALLY THROUGH OUR FOCUS ON THREE THEMES: WE WILL STOP HIV BY PREVENTING NEW HIV INFECTIONS (PREVENTION), REDUCING MORBIDITY AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (TREATMENT) AND DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR ERADICATION (ART-FREE REMISSION). THIS GRANT WILL FUND AIDS-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY INVESTIGATORS AT UCLA, CDU AND OUR AFFILIATED INSTITUTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER IN TORRANCE; THE UCLA CARE CLINIC AND THE VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN WESTWOOD; THE UCLA VINE STREET CLINIC IN WEST HOLLYWOOD; AND THE DREW CARES, THE CDU PUSH COALITION AND THE MLK OASIS CLINIC AT CDU. THESE FACILITIES ARE AT GROUND ZERO FOR THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PERSONS LIVING WITH HIV RESIDING IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS DIRECTLY SERVED BY OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS. IN ADDITION TO THE FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS BASED IN LOS ANGELES, RESEARCHERS AT UCLA AND CDU HAVE EXTENSIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH HIV PROGRAMS AROUND THE GLOBE THAT ARE AIMED AT BUILDING GLOBAL CAPACITY. THE CFAR WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER RESEARCH AT THE INTERFACE OF COMMUNITY BY REACHING COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED AND BY BRINGING TO BEAR THE TALENT OF CDU AND UCLA RESEARCHERS TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS FROM A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE WHILE MENTORING THE NEXT GENERATION WHO BETTER REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES BEING SERVED. THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE UCLA-CDU CFAR WILL ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AIDS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES BY HARNESSING THE DIVERSE EXPERTISE IN OUR CFAR, AND BY INCLUDING LINKAGES TO COMMUNITY- BASED CLINICIAN INVESTIGATORS AND COMMUNITIES.

MECHANICAL AND BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS\u2014IT GENERATES, TRANSMITS, AND SUPPORTS FORCES, AND IT REGULATES ORGAN-LEVEL HOMEOSTASIS AND WHOLE-BODY METABOLISM. THE MECHANICS AND BIOLOGY OF THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM ARE INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED AND LONG-RANGING, WHERE MECHANICAL CUES, MOLECULAR SIGNALS, AND CELL INTERACTIONS AFFECT EACH OTHER ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES, FROM THE BODY, TO ORGAN, TISSUE, CELL, AND MOLECULE LEVELS. PROGRESS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL RESEARCH DEPENDS ON ADDRESSING THE MECHANICS AND BIOLOGY OF ADJACENT ORGANS, AND EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF INJURY AS WELL AS AGING. IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS (E.G., OSTEOARTHRITIS, OSTEOPOROSIS, MUSCLE WASTING, POST-TRAUMATIC REPAIR, DEGENERATION) THEREFORE REQUIRES A RESEARCH PARADIGM THAT ADDRESSES THE SYNERGIES WITHIN THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM AND COMBINES BOTH MECHANICAL AND BIOLOGICAL APPROACHES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES.  THE DELAWARE CENTER FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL RESEARCH (DCMR) WILL SUPPORT BASIC AND PRECLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE CENTRAL THEME OF MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH\u2014FROM THE LEVEL OF THE ENTIRE BODY TO THE ACTIONS OF KEY CELLS AND MOLECULES\u2014WITH EMPHASIS ON UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL CUES INFLUENCE TISSUE STRUCTURE AND NORMAL FUNCTION AND DYSFUNCTION, AND IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS. THE PROPOSED DCMR WILL: AIM 1: ACCELERATE FUNDAMENTAL MUSCULOSKELETAL RESEARCH BY SUPPORTING SYNERGISTIC AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY  RESEARCH PROJECTS.

THE OVERALL SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS NEW CANCER-SPECIFIC PARTNERSHIP ARE TO: PLAN, IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE A HIGHLY INTEGRATED AND INTERACTIVE CANCER HEALTH DISPARITIES PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CSUF AND UCI- CFCCC; CONDUCT PILOT CANCER HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH PROJECTS INVOLVING AT LEAST ONE INVESTIGATOR AT EACH INSTITUTION THAT ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE REGARDING CANCER HEALTH DISPARITIES, LEADING TO THE SUBMISSION OF COMPETITIVE GRANT APPLICATIONS BY NIH/NCI AND OTHER FEDERAL/NON-FEDERAL AGENCIES; AND PROVIDE CANCER RESEARCH EDUCATION TO UNDERREPRESENTED UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS TO INCREASE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF CANCER HEALTH DISPARITIES, LEADING TO A LARGER POOL OF HIGHLY TALENTED FUTURE SCIENTISTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE WILL UNDERTAKE A SET OF ACTIVITIES ORGANIZED UNDER FOUR COMPONENTS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERALL ADMINISTRATIVE AND FISCAL ASPECTS OF ALL P20 ACTIVITIES, AND WILL INCLUDE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND INTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. ACTIVITIES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THREE STAGES: INITIAL PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION. THE EVALUATION EFFORT WILL BE SPEARHEADED BY AN EXTERNAL EVALUATOR WITH EXPERTISE IN MULTI-COMPONENT CENTER REVIEWS. THE TWO PILOT RESEARCH PROJECTS EACH FOCUS ON A CANCER HEALTH DISPARITY: THE FIRST IS A BASIC SCIENCE STUDY THAT WILL CONDUCT LIPIDOMIC PROFILING, AND DNA AND RNA SEQUENCING OF TUMOR/NAT PAIRED SAMPLES TO OPTIMIZE SAMPLE PREPARATION AND DETECT GENETIC/GENOMIC AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC DIFFERENCES THAT ARE RELATED TO AFRICAN AMERICAN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER RISK. THE SECOND IS AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY THAT WILL EXAMINE ASIAN SUB-ETHNIC GROUP DIFFERENCES IN OVARIAN CANCER MORTALITY AND TREATMENT PATTERNS. THE LONG TERM GOALS OF THIS COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP ARE TO DIVERSITY THE CANCER RESEARCH WORKFORCE AND ULTIMATELY INCREASE OUR SCIENTIFIC IMPACT TO ADDRESS THE CANCER HEALTH DISPARITY NEEDS IN
