THE EARMARK ID IS D2011-ALTA-005. THE GREATER NEW HAVEN TRANSIT DISTRICT IS THE FISCAL AGENT AND TEAM ADMINISTRATOR FOR THIS GRANT (EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE ATTACHED); THE CITY OF NEW HAVEN IS MANAGING THE PROJECT.THE CITY OF NEW HAVEN IS UNDERTAKING AN ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS (AA) STUDY TO IDENTIFY AND ENHANCE PUBLIC TRANSIT CONNECTIVITY IN THE REGION. THE STUDY INCLUDES A REVIEW OF TRANSIT NEEDS ACCESS TO TRANSIT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO RESIDENTS OF THE CITY. THE HONORABLE MS. TONI HARP CITY OF NEW HAVEN MAYOR AND OTHER MAJOR PARTNERS INCLUDING THE GREATER NEW HAVEN TRANSIT DISTRICT CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CTTRANSIT AND SOUTH CENTRAL REGIONAL COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AA STUDY AND THE IMPACT IT MAY HAVE FOR FUTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMUNITY AND IMPROVED ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT. THE CITY ORIGINALLY APPLIED FOR THIS GRANT IN 2011. DUE TO THE NARROW INITIAL FIXED-RAIL PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION CHALLENGES LOCAL MATCH FOR THE PROJECT WAS INITIALLY DENIED IN A VOTE BY THE BOARD OF ALDERS. AFTER A CHANGE IN POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS THE BOARD HELD ANOTHER VOTE IN SPRING 2014 REVERSING THE INITIAL DECISION ALLOWING THE CITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE STUDY BY AGREEING TO PROVIDE THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE LOCAL MATCH (AFTER CTDOTS STATE MATCH CONTRIBUTION).; ACTIVITIES PERFORMED: THE STUDY WILL FOCUS ON THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A STREETCAR LINE IN NEW HAVEN. IT WILL ALSO EVALUATE ALL REASONABLE MODAL AND MULTIMODAL ALTERNATIVES AND GENERAL ALIGNMENT OPTIONS FOR THE CORRIDOR. MODES AND ALIGNMENTS TO BE STUDIED INCLUDE A BROAD RANGE OF TRANSIT ALTERNATIVES INCLUDING ENHANCED BUS SERVICE BUS RAPID TRANSIT (BRT) HEAVY RAIL AND URBAN CIRCULATORS (MODERN STREETCAR) ALONG APPROPRIATE CORRIDORS WITHIN THE CT TRANSIT AND GNHTD SERVICE AREA. THE STUDY ANALYSIS WILL ALSO EXPLORE EXISTING CT TRANSIT BUS SERVICES GREATER NEW HAVEN TRANSIT DISTRICT SERVICE UNIVERSITY SHUTTLE SERVICES CONNECTIONS TO UNION STATION INCLUDING METRO-NORTH TO NEW YORK CITY SHORE LINE EAST AND AMTRAK AND OTHER TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS IN THE AREA.THIS STUDY WILL REVIEW AND DELINEATE PRIMARY TRANSIT ROUTES WITH HIGH RIDERSHIP TRAVELING INTO DOWNTOWN AND TRANSIT SERVICES WITHIN THE DOWNTOWN AREA AND WILL IDENTIFY THE AREAS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT DEPEND HEAVILY ON TRANSIT SERVICES. SEVERAL TRANSIT ROUTES TRAVELING INTO THE DOWNTOWN AREA ARE CURRENTLY SERVED BY FREQUENT LOCAL BUSES AND ARE LOCATED NEAR SIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS OF ZERO-CAR HOUSEHOLDS AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES. TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS AND INVESTMENT MAY LEVERAGE CITY GRANT PROGRAMS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUSINESS ASSISTANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO IMPROVE LIVABILITY IN THE COMMUNITY.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: A MAP OF THE PRIMARY TRANSIT SERVICES IS INCLUDED AS AN ATTACHMENT IN TEAM. THE THICKER LINES INDICATE HIGHER SERVICE LEVELS AND FREQUENCIES. THE CITY OF NEW HAVEN HAS A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 130000 WITH THE GREATER NEW HAVEN AREA AT OVER 850000 PERSONS. NEW HAVEN IS THE LARGEST CITY WITHIN THE REGION AND HAS A DENSITY OF 6500 PERSONS PER SQUARE MILE. THE NEW HAVEN AREA HAS SEEN AN INCREASE IN RECENT NEW DEVELOPMENTS. OTHER REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA ARE HELPING TO CREATE A VIBRANT URBAN COMMUNITY. IMPROVED TRANSIT AND MOBILITY CONNECTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE RESIDENTS HAVE A TRULY LIVABLE COMMUNITY. THIS NEW HAVEN ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS WILL IDENTIFY TRANSIT OPTIONS THAT WILL PROVIDE A SAFE EFFICIENT ECONOMICAL ATTRACTIVE AND INTEGRATED TRANSIT SYSTEM THAT OFFERS CONVENIENT ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE MOBILITY AROUND THE REGION AND TO THOSE SECTIONS OF THE CITY THAT DEPEND ON IT SO HEAVILY.MATCHING FUNDS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE BEING PROVIDED BY THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT AND THE CITY OF NEW HAVEN--COMMITMENT LETTERS ARE ATTACHED TO THE GRANT.
