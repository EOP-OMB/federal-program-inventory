THIS DEVICE COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT ON BRAIN RESEARCH BY ALLOWING FOR MICROSCOPIC, MULTI-FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF BRAIN FUNCTIONS UNDER VARIOUS EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT WILL INTEGRATE THE DISRUPTIVE HIGH-PERFORMANCE 3D CZT IMAGING-SPECTROMETER TECHNOLOGIES WITH A NOVEL SYNTHETIC COMPOUND EYE (SCE) CAMERA DESIGN, AS WELL AS AN INNOVATIVE ITERATIVE IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION METHOD USING DEEP-LEARNING BASED PRIORS, TO DEVELOP A NEXT-GENERATION CLINICAL BRAIN SPECT IMAGING SYSTEM WITH TRANSFORMATIVE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND IMAGING SENSITIVITY UNATTAINABLE PREVIOUSLY. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO APPLY THIS INNOVATIVE IMAGING SYSTEM TO HUMAN BRAIN SPECT STUDIES USING A COLLECTION OF VARIOUS SPECT RADIOTRACERS, AND DEVELOP AND ADVANCE PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETRIC IMAGING METHODOLOGIES, IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE LONG-STANDING ISSUES IN NEUROBIOLOGY AND IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERPLAY AND RELATIONSHIP AMONG CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND PERFUSION, BRAIN TISSUE OXYGENATION, NEURONAL CELL METABOLISM, AND BRAIN CELL TRACKING UNDER DIFFERENT COGNITIVE CHALLENGES AND BIOPHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN HEALTHY AND IN DISEASE.

AMONG THE VARIOUS BRAIN IMAGING TECHNIQUES, FUNCTIONAL NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (FNIRS) IS AN OPTICAL METHOD THAT IMAGES THE HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSE TO BRAIN ACTIVATION BY MEASURING THE OXY-(HBO) AND DEOXY-(HBR) HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATION CHANGES DUE TO BRAIN ACTIVATION. IT IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR POPULATIONS AND FOR STUDIES FOR WHICH OTHER IMAGING MODALITIES ARE LIMITED, E.G. FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI), INCLUDING FOR CHILDREN, INFANTS, AND STUDIES THAT INVOLVE MOTION AND INTERACTIONS OR REQUIRE HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. HOWEVER, FNIRS BRAIN SENSITIVITY IN ADULT HUMANS IS TYPICALLY AROUND 10%, AND FNIRS ALONE DOES NOT PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL THE HEMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS AS IT DOES NOT MEASURE CHANGES IN CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW (CBF). HERE, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A FIBER-BASED SPECKLE CONTRAST OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY (SCOS) SYSTEM TO MEASURE CBF VARIATIONS DUE TO BRAIN ACTIVATION IN HUMANS. SCOS USES RELATIVELY LOW-COST COMPLEMENTARY METAL\u2013OXIDE\u2013 SEMICONDUCTOR (CMOS) CAMERAS AS DETECTORS.

THE PROJECT HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE VISION OF THE NIH BRAIN INITIATIVE: TRANSFORMATIVE BRAIN NON-INVASIVE IMAGING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. THE CORE COMPONENT OF THE MAGNETOMETER IS A QUANTUM-BASED MAGNETIC TUNNEL JUNCTION (MTJ), A NANOSCALE SENSING DEVICE WITH POTENTIALLY UNPRECEDENTED SENSITIVITY AND PERFORMANCE. THROUGH A SERIES OF STEPS AND INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION, THIS PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE CURRENT MTJS BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE AND TO DEVELOP TRIAXIAL MTJ SENSORS CAPABLE OF RECORDING THE BRAIN'S MAGNETIC FIELDS WITH THE HIGHEST INFORMATION DENSITY. ONCE THE DESIRED SENSITIVITY IS ACHIEVED, THE PROJECT WILL BUILD A WHOLE-HEAD 300-CHANNEL MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHIC (MEG) SYSTEM BASED ON MTJS, WHICH CAN OPERATE FULLY UNTETHERED, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN EXPENSIVE MAGNETICALLY SHIELDED ROOM OR NULLING COILS. BY DESIGN, THE SENSORS WILL BE IMMUNE TO NATURAL HEAD MOTION, FURTHER ENABLING THE SYSTEM TO FUNCTION IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN DESIGNING AND PRODUCING SENSORS THAT CAN DETECT MAGNETIC FIELDS AS LOW AS 50 FT. FIRST, THE PROJECT WILL IMPROVE THE DETECTABILITY OF CURRENT PROTOTYPE SENSORS BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BY USING A SERIES OF INNOVATIVE APPROACHES IN SENSOR DESIGN, ATOMIC ENGINEERING, FABRICATION, AND NOISE REDUCTION. SECOND, THE PROJECT WILL DESIGN AND PACKAGE TRIAXIAL SENSORS THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURE TANGENTIAL AND RADIAL MAGNETIC FIELDS. THIRD, THE PROJECT WILL REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE SENSORS BY MORE THAN FIVE TIMES COMPARED TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES, SO THAT MORE SENSORS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ON A FULL-HEAD HELMET TO IMPROVE SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND LOCALIZATION. FINALLY, AND IMPORTANTLY, THE PROJECT WILL INCREASE THE FIELD DYNAMIC RANGE OF THE SENSORS OVER THE TECHNOLOGIES BASED ON OPM (OPTICALLY PUMPED MAGNETOMETER) AND SQUID (SUPERCONDUCTING QUANTUM INTERFERENCE DEVICE), SO THAT THE MTJ-MEG SYSTEM CAN OPERATE WITHOUT THE NEED OF MAGNETIC SHIELDING TO ALLOW REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS. ONCE THESE GROUNDBREAKING MTJ SENSORS ARE DEVELOPED, THE PROJECT WILL INTEGRATE THE MTJ-MEG SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR VERIFYING PERFORMANCE VERSUS COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES. THE PROJECT WILL USE THE MTJ-MEG SYSTEM TO ASSESS BRAIN RELATED SIGNALS DURING SENSORY STIMULATION, COGNITIVE PROCESSING, AND MOTOR ACTIONS.

TO FOSTER RESEARCH TRAINING THAT WILL CULTIVATE GRADUATES ABLE TO RESPOND WITH AGILITY TO FUTURE BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE NEEDS AND DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS AFRICAN HEALTH CHALLENGES, FORMAL INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE IS NEEDED. SUCH TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD INCLUDE: (I) BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE APPLIED TO DATA FROM MULTI-OMICS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS BIOMEDICAL IMAGING, COUPLED WITH THE ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE ADVANCES; (II) FUNDAMENTAL AND ADVANCED CONCEPTS IN MACHINE INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL PARADIGMS FOR DEVELOPING NOVEL APPROACHES FOR MINING LARGE-SCALE BIOMEDICAL DATA; AND (III) AWARENESS, AMONGST GRADUATES, OF CAREER OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE ALONG WITH HOW THE SOFT AND HARD SKILLS GAINED IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM COULD BE TRANSFERRED INTO A RANGE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY/BIOMEDICAL INDUSTRIES AND RESEARCH/PROFESSIONAL CAREERS. MOTIVATED BY THESE NEEDS AND LEVERAGING THE EXPERTISE IN CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AS WELL AS BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS AT OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY (OHSU), WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE \u201cCOMPUTATIONAL OMICS AND BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS PROGRAM\u201d (COBIP) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA. THE PROGRAM WILL INTRODUCE GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS TO TRAIN AFRICAN BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENTISTS AND FACULTY IN RIGOROUS FUNDAMENTAL DATA SCIENCE, COMPUTATIONAL OMICS, CLINICAL INFORMATICS AND IMAGING DATA SCIENCE. COBIP WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE AFRICAN DISEASE BURDEN AND ARE RELEVANT TO GLOBAL HEALTH. SPECIFICALLY, WE AIM TO: 1) DEVELOP AN INTERDISCIPLINARY DATA SCIENCE TRAINING PROGRAM FOCUSED ON THE HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF AFRICA; 2) TRAIN FACULTY WITH RELEVANT DISCIPLINARY BACKGROUNDS, FROM COLLABORATING AFRICAN INSTITUTIONS, IN BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD ACROSS THE CONTINENT; AND 3) ESTABLISH COBIP AS AN INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN COMPUTATIONAL OMICS AND BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS, DISTRIBUTED ACROSS AFRICAN INSTITUTIONS AS A COLLABORATIVE NETWORK OF FACULTY, RESEARCHERS, AND STUDENTS FOCUSED ON THE AFRICAN HEALTH PRIORITIES. COBIP WILL ATTRACT COHORTS OF TRAINEES FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING MATHEMATICS, STATISTICS, INFORMATICS, COMPUTER SCIENCES, ENGINEERING AND BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES. COBIP WILL PROVIDE INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS LINKS BETWEEN CLINICIANS, RESEARCHERS AND BIOMEDICAL INDUSTRIES THROUGH PLACEMENTS AND INTERNSHIPS. COBIP, THROUGH ITS GRADUATES, WILL HAVE DECISIVE IMPACTS ON AFRICAN BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH AND STIMULATE DIAGNOSTICS, THERAPEUTIC SELECTION AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT IMPROVED HUMAN

INFLUENCE OF BRAIN STATES ON NEURAL COMPUTATION AND BEHAVIOR  PROJECT SUMMARY A CENTRAL CHALLENGE IN NEUROSCIENCE INVOLVES UNDERSTANDING HOW ASSEMBLIES OF CORTICAL NEURONS, COMPRISED OF DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AND INHABITING DIFFERENT LAYERS, WORK TOGETHER TO GENERATE COHERENT DYNAMICAL INTERNAL STATES, THAT THEN INTERACT WITH EXTERNAL SENSORY INPUTS TO GENERATE STATE-DEPENDENT BEHAVIORS ON A MOMENT-BY-MOMENT BASIS. KEY IMPEDIMENTS TO MEETING THIS FOUNDATIONAL CHALLENGE INCLUDE LACK OF ADEQUATE TECHNOLOGICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS TO MONITOR, CONTROL, IDENTIFY AND MODEL NEURAL STATE DYNAMICS EMERGING FROM CORTICAL CELL ASSEMBLIES SPANNING MULTIPLE CORTICAL CELL-TYPES AND LAYERS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN UNPRECEDENTED CONFLUENCE OF TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTATION TO ACHIEVE SUCH CAPABILITIES BY BUILDING ON OUR TEAM\u2019S SIGNIFICANT PRIOR WORK. IN PARTICULAR, OUR COMBINED TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTATION PLATFORM WILL ENABLE US TO: (1) PERFORM VOLUMETRIC IMAGING OF THOUSANDS OF CORTICAL CELLS DURING BEHAVIOR TO COLLECT BOTH RELEVANT SPATIOTEMPORAL ACTIVITY PATTERNS AND 3D POSITIONING; (2) SIMULTANEOUSLY WRITE ARBITRARY SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS INTO TENS TO HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIED CELLS AT MILLISECOND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION USING 2-PHOTON MULTISLM METHODS; AND (3) USING HYDROGEL TISSUE-CHEMISTRY AND SINGLE-CELL SEQUENCING METHODS, OBTAIN DEEP MOLECULAR CELL-TYPE INFORMATION IN THE SAME NEURONS THAT WERE BOTH MEASURED AND CONTROLLED DURING BEHAVIOR. THIS UNPRECEDENTED SIMULTANEOUS READ/WRITE/CELL-TYPING TECHNOLOGY WILL BE TIGHTLY INTEGRATED WITH COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THAT CAN: (1) EMPLOY STATE OF THE ART SYSTEMS IDENTIFICATION METHODS TO IDENTIFY AND EXTRACT NEURAL STATES AND THE DYNAMICAL LAWS GOVERNING THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH EXTERNAL INPUTS; AND (2) AMONGST THE ASTRONOMICAL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE SPATIOTEMPORAL STIMULATION PATTERNS, PREDICT INTERESTING ONES THAT CAN BEST REFINE MODELS, YIELD CONCEPTUAL INSIGHTS, AND YIELD THE CAPACITY FOR OPTIMAL CONTROL OF CORTICAL CIRCUIT DYNAMICS, WITH POTENTIAL CLINICAL RELEVANCE. THIS COMBINED TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTATION WILL EMPOWER NEXT-GENERATION EXPERIMENTS THAT ALLOW US TO LEARN THE DYNAMICAL LANGUAGE (IN TERMS OF STATE SPACE DYNAMICS) OF CORTICAL CIRCUITS, PLAY BACK MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THIS LANGUAGE FOR BOTH INSIGHT AND CONTROL, AND UNDERSTAND HOW THIS LANGUAGE EMERGES FROM THE CONCERTED ACTIVITY OF MULTIPLE CELL-TYPES ACROSS LAYERS. OUR TECHNOLOGY/COMPUTATION PLATFORM WILL BE VALIDATED IN MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTS ACROSS SPECIES AND BRAIN REGIONS, GUIDED BY DEEP AND LONG-STANDING THEORIES OF INTERNAL STATE DYNAMICS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE. THROUGHOUT, NEW METHODS WILL BE COLLABORATIVELY VALIDATED IN THE DIVERSE PREPARATIONS OF OUR EXPERIMENTAL LABS (SUCH CROSS-CUTTING INTERACTIONS ARE SHOWN IN BLUE TEXT). IN PARTICULAR WE WILL FOCUS ON TESTING THEORIES UNDERLYING SEVERAL FOUNDATIONAL CLASSES OF NEURAL COMPUTATION: (1) ABILITY OF SENSORY NETWORKS TO GENERATE ACCURATE PERCEPTS BY DETECTING AND AMPLIFYING WEAK SENSORY INPUTS AMIDST SPONTANEOUS BACKGROUND ACTIVITY; (2) BAYESIAN INTEGRATION OF MULTISENSORY INPUTS TO CONVERT SENSORIMOTOR EXPERIENCES INTO INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF EXTERNAL STATE VARIABLES AND

DIAGNOSES BASED ON THE ULTRASENSITIVE DETECTION OF PROTEINS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL COMBINE DETECTION OF PROTEINS USING THE SINGLE MOLECULE ARRAY (SIMOA; QUANTERIX CORPORATION) TECHNOLOGY AND ASSAY PROCESSING USING DIGITAL MICROFLUIDICS (DMF) TO ENABLE POC IMMUNOASSAYS WITH THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION TESTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR NUCLEIC ACID PURIFICATION OR AMPLIFICATION, AND WITH THE SIMPLICITY, SAMPLE TYPE FLEXIBILITY, AND DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE TO DELIVER CENTRAL LAB DIAGNOSTIC QUALITY IN POC SETTINGS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WOULD BE COMPOSED OF A SAMPLE- TO-ANSWER, RANDOM ACCESS, BENCHTOP INSTRUMENT UTILIZING A UNIVERSAL CONSUMABLE DESIGN ACCEPTING A BROAD RANGE OF MINIMALLY PROCESSED SAMPLES RELEVANT TO POC DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASE, INCLUDING SWAB, SALIVA, AND BLOOD (INCLUDING FINGERSTICK) SAMPLES. WE WILL FIRST APPLY THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA, OPTIMIZING EXISTING ASSAYS FOR SARS-COV-2 N-PROTEIN AND DEVELOPING NEW MULTIPLEXED ASSAYS FOR INFLUENZA A AND B ANTIGENS, ALONG WITH SIMPLE SAMPLE PREPARATION METHODS, FOR TESTING OF NASAL/NASOPHARYNGEAL (NP) SWAB (SARS-COV-2/INFLUENZA) AND SALIVA/BLOOD (SARS-COV-2 ONLY) SAMPLES.

FIRST, WE WILL DEVELOP THE KEY TECHNOLOGIES TO ENABLE THE POC SYSTEM, NAMELY: A LOW-COST SIMOA IMAGER WITH A SMALL FORM FACTOR; SINGLE MOLECULE LABELS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE SEALING IN MICROWELL ARRAYS; AND, THE DMF BUILDING BLOCKS FOR ASSAY PROCESSING, RESULTING IN AN INTEGRATED SIMOA-DMF DEVICE. SECOND, WE WILL DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND TEST SIMOA POC INSTRUMENTS AND CONSUMABLES, FIRST IN PROTOTYPE AND THEN FOR TEST VALIDATION. THIRD, WE WILL OPTIMIZE/DEVELOP AND VALIDATE ANALYTICALLY SIMOA ASSAYS (INCLUDING SAMPLE PREPARATION OPTIONS) FOR SARS- COV-2 (NASAL SWAB, SALIVA, BLOOD) AND MULTIPLEX INFLUENZA A/B (NP SWAB) ANTIGENS, AND TEST THEM ON THE PROTOTYPE SIMOA POC SYSTEM. FINALLY, WE WILL CLINICALLY VALIDATE THE POC ANTIGEN TESTS AGAINST GOLD-STANDARD MOLECULAR TESTS FOR ALL SAMPLE TYPES USING DISCARDED/BANKED CLINICAL SAMPLES, AND EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF THE POC SYSTEM IN POC SETTINGS USING CONTRIVED CLINICAL SAMPLES. USER FEEDBACK WILL INFORM DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE PROPOSAL. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A BROADLY ENABLING TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASES USING ULTRASENSITIVE PROTEIN DETECTION AT THE POC IN A SMALL, LOW-COST BENCHTOP SYSTEM. THIS TYPE OF CAPABILITY IS AVAILABLE FOR MOLECULAR TESTING BUT NOT FOR PROTEIN DETECTION, AND WOULD COMBINE HIGH SENSITIVITY WITH LOW COST AND AN ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY CHAIN TO SUPPORT DIAGNOSIS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN DIVERSE CLINICAL SETTINGS.

NASH CAN LEAD TO LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS, BUT IS DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE AT EARLY STAGES. LIVER BIOPSY IS THE CURRENT STANDARD TO DIAGNOSE NAFL/NASH, BUT BIOPSY IS INVASIVE, HAS ASSOCIATED MORBIDITY, AND IS LIMITED BY SAMPLING ERRORS AND INTER-OBSERVER VARIABILITY. MANY PATIENTS PRESENT WITH LATER STAGE NASH, ADVERSELY IMPACTING OUTCOMES AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, WHICH ARE ESTIMATED AT $32 BILLION ANNUALLY IN THE U.S. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI), INCLUDING ELASTOGRAPHY (MRE), IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN NON-INVASIVELY QUANTIFY HEPATIC FAT (MRI PROTON-DENSITY FAT FRACTION), IRON OVERLOAD (MRI R2*), AND FIBROSIS (MRE STIFFNESS).

IN ADDITION, EARLY TISSUE CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH NASH ARE NOT ADEQUATELY CHARACTERIZED USING CONVENTIONAL MRI. THE COMMON REQUIREMENTS OF BREATH-HOLDING AND LONG PROTOCOLS ALSO SEVERELY LIMIT THE ADOPTION OF LIVER MRI IN THE CLINIC.

USE THE SYSTEM FOR LESION AND NORMAL TISSUE DOSIMETRY IN METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIUM-223 (XOFIGO). THE PROPOSAL IS FOUNDED ON A PARTNERSHIP OF UNPARALLELED INSTRUMENTATION DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY (DR. MENG), COUPLED WITH CUTTING-EDGE CAPABILITY IN IMPLEMENTING ADVANCED ALGORITHMS FOR MULTI-DIMENSIONAL IMAGE GENERATION (DRS. FREY AND DU) THAT WILL BE APPLIED TO THE DOSIMETRY DEMANDS (DR. SGOUROS) OF A NEW AND PROMISING TREATMENT THAT DELIVERS HIGHLY POTENT RADIATION TO DISSEMINATED CANCER CELLS. BEYOND THE SPECIFIC CLINICAL SCENARIO THAT IS DRIVING THE PROPOSED APPLICATION, THE IMAGING INSTRUMENTATION TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IS A SIGNIFICANT FIRST STEP TO BUILDING IMAGING INSTRUMENTATION THAT WILL SERVE MUCH BROADER CLINICAL NEEDS IN ONCOLOGY AND ALSO IN CARDIOLOGY AND NEUROLOGY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01EB031798_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140057828, "Award ID": "U01EB031641", "Award Amount": 1830321.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-09", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "TOWARD FUNCTIONAL MOLECULAR NEUROIMAGING USING VASOACTIVE PROBES IN HUMAN SUBJECTS - WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A PROBE TECHNOLOGY FOR MONITORING HUMAN BRAIN FUNCTION WITH MOLECULAR PRECISION; IN CONJUNCTION WITH MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) OR OTHER IMAGING MODALITIES, THE PROBES WILL PROVIDE A COMBINATION OF SENSITIVITY AND RESOLUTION THAT COULD PERMIT UNPRECEDENTED NONINVASIVE STUDIES OF DYNAMIC NEU- ROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN PEOPLE. OUR STRATEGY IS BASED ON A FUNDAMENTALLY NEW TYPE OF CHEMICAL IMAGING PROBE DESIGNED TO PRODUCE NEUROIMAGING READOUTS BY PURPOSEFULLY MANIPULATING ENDOGENOUS HEMODYNAMIC CONTRAST IN THE BRAIN\u2014REPURPOSING THE BLOOD OXYGEN LEVEL DEPENDENT (BOLD) EFFECT THAT UNDERLIES CONVENTIONAL FUNCTIONAL MRI (FMRI). THIS NEW \u201cVASOPROBE\u201d CONCEPT OFFERS THREE KEY ADVANTAGES: FIRST, BY PROVIDING TIME-DE- PENDENT SENSITIVITY TO DILUTE MOLECULAR SPECIES SUCH AS NEUROTRANSMITTERS, THE PROBES CAN ENABLE WELL-DEFINED NEUROBIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA TO BE MAPPED DYNAMICALLY ACROSS THE ENTIRE BRAIN, DRAMATICALLY SURPASSING EXISTING NONSPECIFIC FMRI APPROACHES. SECOND, BECAUSE OF THE ENDOGENOUS CONTRAST SOURCE THEY INFLUENCE, THE PROBES ARE DETECTABLE ON A VARIETY OF SPATIOTEMPORAL SCALES BY NONINVASIVE IMAGING MODALITIES COMPLEMENTARY TO FMRI, SUCH AS DIFFUSE OPTICAL OR ULTRASOUND-BASED METHODS. THIRD, BY CIRCUMVENTING LIMITATIONS OF ESTABLISHED OPTICAL, MAGNETIC, AND RADIOACTIVE PROBE DESIGNS, VASOPROBES COMBINE EXQUISITE SENSITIVITY APPROACHING THAT OF POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) WITH THE RESOLUTION AND VERSATILITY OF MRI. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL BUILD ON OUR RECENT PROOF-OF-CONCEPT WORK WITH VASOPROBES TO ESTABLISH NONINVASIVE BRAIN-WIDE DELIVERY STRATEGIES AND TO DEVELOP ROBUST NEUROCHEMICAL SENSORS THAT FUNCTION IN PRIMATES. THE TECHNOLOGY WE ESTABLISH WILL ADDRESS MULTIPLE GOALS IN BASIC AND APPLIED NEUROSCIENCE, AND WE EXPECT IT TO YIELD MOLECULAR PROBES THAT WILL BE APPROPRIATE FOR CLINICAL EVALUATION IN HUMAN SUBJECTS BY THE END OF THE PROJECT PERIOD.  IN AIM 1, WE WILL CREATE VASOPROBE VARIANTS THAT CAN BE DELIVERED TO THE BRAIN VIA INTRAVENOUS INJECTION AND SPONTANEOUS PERMEATION THROUGH THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB). WE WILL FORM CONJUGATES OF VASOPROBE-BASED SENSORS WITH \u201cBRAIN SHUTTLE\u201d ANTIBODIES THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SHOWN TO ENABLE BRAIN IMPORT VIA RECEPTOR- MEDIATED TRANSCYTOSIS. DEMONSTRATION OF BRAIN-PERMEABLE VASOPROBES WILL ESTABLISH A CLINICALLY VIABLE PATH FOR FACILE, NONINVASIVE APPLICATIONS OF VASOPROBES THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN. IN AIM 2, WE WILL OPTIMIZE VASOPROBES TO SENSE THE KEY NEUROTRANSMITTERS DOPAMINE AND GLUTAMATE; WE WILL THEN APPLY THEM ON A BRAIN-WIDE SCALE FOR MOLECULAR-LEVEL FMRI IN RODENT BRAINS. THESE EXPERIMENTS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUTCOME OF AIM 1, WILL SET THE STAGE FOR APPLICATIONS OF NEUROTRANSMITTER-SENSITIVE VASOPROBES AND RELATED SENSORS IN PRIMATE BRAINS. ACCORD- INGLY, IN AIM 3, WE WILL ADAPT NEUROTRANSMITTER-SENSITIVE VASOPROBE TECHNOLOGY FOR FUNCTIONAL MOLECULAR NEUROIM- AGING IN MARMOSETS, A TRACTABLE PRIMATE SPECIES WITH WHICH WE HAVE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS IN MARMOSETS WILL THEREFORE ESTABLISH GROUNDBREAKING IMAGING AGENTS SUITABLE FOR TRANS- LATION TO HUMANS, AS WELL AS FOR ADAPTATION TO MANY FURTHER

SUBSTANCE- EXPOSED INFANTS ARE AT PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK FOR ADVERSE OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, FINDINGS ARE INCONSISTENT, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO DISENTANGLE PRENATAL EXPOSURE EFFECTS FROM OTHER ADVERSE INFLUENCES. THE OBJECTIVES OF OUR HEALTHY BRAIN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT (HBCD) PRENATAL EXPERIENCES AND LONGITUDINAL DEVELOPMENT (PRELUDE) CONSORTIUM ARE TO CHARACTERIZE TYPICAL TRAJECTORIES OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT FROM BIRTH THROUGH CHILDHOOD, MEASURING THE INFLUENCE OF KEY BIOLOGIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS ON CHILD SOCIAL, COGNITIVE, AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL ASSESS HOW CHILDREN PRENATALLY EXPOSED TO OPIOIDS AND OTHER SUBSTANCES, AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL ADVERSITY, DIFFER IN THOSE BRAIN TRAJECTORIES AND OUTCOMES.

UNFORTUNATELY, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATE AN ALARMING INCREASE IN INCI- DENCE IN POPULATIONS BELOW THE AGE OF 50, WHO ARE NOT ROUTINELY SCREENED. FURTHERMORE, CRC DETECTION IS DIFFICULT IN HIGH-RISK GROUPS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION (E.G. FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS), DISEASE TRAITS (E.G. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE), OR FROM CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS (E.G. BLACK-AMERICANS). THUS, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF CRC AND THE PREVENTION OF THE TRANSITION FROM ADENOMA TO CRC. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM WILL DEVELOP GENETICALLY ENGINEERED BACTERIA USING SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY EARLY CRC DEVELOPMENT, MONITOR AND REPORT CHANGES IN THE ADENOMA AND CRC MICROENVIRONMENT, AND PREVENT CANCER PROGRESSION. TO ACHIEVE THE ABOVE OBJECTIVES, ENGINEERED BACTERIA HAVE TO ENGRAFT AND COLONIZE THE HOSTILE LUMINAL ENVIRONMENT, SENSE AND DISTINGUISH AN ABNORMAL ENVIRONMENTAL SIGNAL, COMPUTE THIS SIGNAL, AND EXPRESS A REPORTER OR A THERAPEUTIC AGENT. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATE VECTORS WITH THESE FEATURES REMAIN LACKING, CONSTRAINING SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY APPLICA- TIONS FOR CANCER RESEARCH. IMPORTANTLY, CRC IS HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH E. COLI, FOR WHICH WE HAVE MANY SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TOOLS. FURTHERMORE, OUR PRELIMINARY PROOF-OF-CONCEPT STUDIES HAVE REVEALED THAT NATIVE E. COLI CAN BE ENGINEERED TO PERPETUALLY COLONIZE FULLY CONVENTIONAL (I.E. NON-MICROBIOME DEPLETED) HOSTS AND TO EXECUTE FUNC- TIONS OF INTEREST, E.G., DECONJUGATION OF LUMINAL BILE ACIDS. DECONJUGATED BILE ACID AND RESULTANT FARNESOID X RE- CEPTOR (FXR) AGONISM CAN SUPPRESS CRC DEVELOPMENT, INDICATING A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC USE OF ENGINEERED NATIVE BACTERIA. BUILDING ON OUR STRONG SUPPORTIVE PRELIMINARY RESULTS, WE WILL IDENTIFY NATIVE E. COLI FROM HEALTHY, ADENOMA, AND CRC TISSUES OF A GENETIC MODEL OF CRC AND ENGINEER THEM TO DETECT AND TREAT CRC IN RESPONSE TO THE CANCER MICROENVIRONMENT.

FOR EXAMPLE, WHOLE-CELL BIOSENSORS SUCH AS BACTERIA HAVE BEEN GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TO PERFORM COMPLEX FUNCTIONS SUCH AS SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION TO DETECT CLINICALLY RELEVANT BIOMARKERS IN HUMAN URINE AND SERUM. IN MAMMALIAN CELLS, SENSE-AND-RESPOND COMPONENTS THAT EMPLOY BOOLEAN LOGIC HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR MULTIPLEXED CONTROL OF ENGINEERED T CELL THERAPIES, THEREBY INCREASING THE SPECIFICITY OF TUMOR SENSING AND REDUCING SYSTEMIC TOXICITY. THESE ADVANCES HIGHLIGHT THE PROMISE OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY WHEN APPLIED TO CANCER, YET THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE STRATEGIES RELY ON GENETIC CIRCUITS AND MAKE USE OF NON-MAMMALIAN PROTEIN COMPONENTS. SUCH CIRCUITS ARE COMPLEX AND RAISE SAFETY AND IMMUNOGENICITY CONCERNS FOR REGULATORY APPROVAL, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF IN VIVO EARLY CANCER DETECTION WHERE REPEATED ADMINISTRATIONS OF BIOSENSORS ARE LIKELY NEEDED TO MONITOR FOR NASCENT DISEASE. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO DEVELOP A NEW CLASS OF DIAGNOSTICS CALLED AND-GATED SYNTHETIC BIOMARKERS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF CANCER METASTASIS. SYNTHETIC BIOMARKERS ARE AN EMERGING CLASS OF ACTIVATABLE BIOLOGICAL SENSORS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BE ADMINISTERED SYSTEMICALLY, QUERY SITES OF EARLY DISEASE, AND HARNESS TUMOR-DEPENDENT ACTIVATION MECHANISMS, SUCH AS DYSREGULATED PROTEASE ACTIVITY, TO DRIVE PRODUCTION OF A REPORTER. THESE REPORTERS CAN THEN BE DETECTED NONINVASIVELY FROM BLOOD, URINE, OR OTHER BODILY FLUID SAMPLES. PROTEASES PLAY KEY BIOLOGICAL ROLES ACROSS THE MAJOR HALLMARKS OF METASTASIS AND ARE PARTICULARLY POTENT MOLECULAR AMPLIFIERS BY CATALYZING THE IRREVERSIBLE HYDROLYSIS OF PEPTIDE BONDS, ALLOWING A SINGLE PROTEASE TO TURNOVER THOUSANDS OF SUBSTRATES.

HEALTHCARE CHALLENGE IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, 20-25% OF DIABETIC PATIENTS DEVELOP FOOT ULCERS (A TYPE OF CHRONIC WOUNDS) AND ABOUT 63.4% OF THEM DEVELOP INFECTIONS. FAILURE TO PREVENT OR MANAGE INFECTIONS RESULTS IN HIGH HEALTHCARE COST, AMPUTATIONS, AND AN INCREASED MORTALITY. DESPITE RECENT PROGRESS IN WOUND CARE, THE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF INFECTED CHRONIC WOUNDS REMAINS CHALLENGING. ONE PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF BIOMATERIAL SCAFFOLDS THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY COMBAT WOUND INFECTION AND PROMOTE WOUND TISSUE REGENERATION. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THE INABILITY TO MONITOR THE WOUND IN REAL TIME AND OFFER FEEDBACK-BASED, PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. ALSO, FREQUENT HOSPITAL VISITS ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING METHODS INCREASE THE PATIENT'S EXPOSURE RISK TO CONTAGIOUS DISEASES (E.G., COVID-19). THUS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP NEW TELEMEDICINE THERAPIES FOR HOME-BASED, EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF INFECTED CHRONIC WOUNDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP INTELLIGENT HIERARCHICAL FIBROUS BIOMATERIALS, CONSISTING OF VERTICALLY ALIGNED MICROFIBERS ON THE BOTTOM (PROMOTING GRANULATION TISSUE FOR- MATION), RADIALLY ALIGNED NANOFIBERS ON THE TOP (ACCELERATING RE-EPITHELIALIZATION), AND MULTIMODAL BIOELECTRONICS INTEGRATED ON NANOFIBERS (MONITORING THE WOUND STATUS AND PROVIDING IONTOPHORESIS-CONTROLLED MULTIPLE DRUG DE- LIVERY), TO TREAT INFECTED CHRONIC WOUNDS.

THE PROPOSED INTELLIGENT BIOMATERIAL IS INNOVATIVE AS COMPARED TO EXISTING SMART DRESSINGS IN LIGHT OF ITS BIODEGRADABLE HIERARCHICAL FIBROUS BIOMATERIAL THAT CAN PROMOTE WOUND TISSUE REGENERATION, ITS INTE- GRATED MULTIMODAL BIOELECTRONICS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION OF WOUND STATUS AND OFFERING FEEDBACK-BASED, MULTISTAGE DELIVERY OF ANTIBIOTICS AND GROWTH FACTORS, AND IN VIVO AND EX VIVO EVALUATIONS USING BOTH DIABETIC MICE WOUNDS AND HUMAN SKIN EXPLANTS TO IDENTIFY EXISTING ISSUES AND ACCORDINGLY IMPROVE DESIGNS AND FABRICATIONS. ALSO, THE CORRELATIONS OF THE WOUND STATUS/HEALING, SENSOR READOUTS AND DELIVERED DRUG AMOUNTS WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN THIS RESEARCH, WHICH ARE STILL LACKING. THE RESEARCH TEAM'S COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE, PAST COLLABORATION EXPERIENCES AND COLLABORATIVELY GENERATED PRELIMINARY RESULTS FORM THE BASIS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES, MRI PRACTITIONERS HAVE USED THE INFORMATION DERIVED FROM BIOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS (LIKE RELAXATION AND DIFFUSION) TO INDIRECTLY PROBE MICROSCOPIC TISSUE COMPARTMENTS USING MILLIMETER-SCALE DATA. WHILE THESE APPROACHES HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL, AN INNOVATIVE NEW PARADIGM HAS EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS THAT LEVERAGES MULTIPARAMETRIC MRI DATA (E.G., USING RELAXATION AND DIFFUSION JOINTLY IN A HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL EXPERIMENT) TO PROBE TISSUE MICROSTRUCTURE WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF DETAIL.

WE RECENTLY PUBLISHED SEVERAL PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL METHODS FOR OPTICALLY MODULATING CARDIAC ACTIVITY IN CULTURED CELLS AS WELL AS IN ADULT RODENT MODELS EX VIVO. THE USE OF LIGHT TO MODULATE CARDIAC TISSUE WITH AN INTENSITY COMPARABLE TO THAT USED IN OPTOGENETICS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED.

IN 2021, THE CDC DETERMINED THAT OPIOID OVERDOSE DEATHS ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY AMONGST BLACKS, ESPECIALLY BLACK MALES. DESPITE THE APPARENT SOLUTION OF ADMINISTERING NALOXONE TO OPIOID-OVERDOSED INDIVIDUALS TO REVERSE THE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MANY PEOPLE STILL DIED BECAUSE NALOXONE WAS NOT ADMINISTERED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THEREFORE, TIMELY DETECTION OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND AUTOMATIC ADMINISTRATION OF THE DRUG NALOXONE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE OVERDOSED ON OPIOIDS IS THE KEY TO SAVING THEIR LIVES. ALTHOUGH ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS MEASUREMENT REMAINS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR GUIDING RESPIRATORY MANAGEMENT, THE NECESSITY FOR PLACEMENT OF INDWELLING ARTERIAL LINES OR INTERMITTENT ARTERIAL OR HEEL BLOOD SAMPLING MAKES IT INAPPLICABLE FOR HOME TESTING.

DISADVANTAGES INCLUDE POTENTIAL FOR SKIN BURNS, FREQUENT SENSOR SITE CHANGES AND RE-CALIBRATIONS. TCPCO2 MONITORING IS MORE ACCURATE THAN END-TIDAL CO2 MONITORING IN PATIENTS WITH SHUNT OR VENTILATION-PERFUSION INEQUALITIES AND CAN BE USED IN SITUATIONS SUCH AS HIGH FREQUENCY OR NON-INVASIVE VENTILATION WHERE END-TIDAL CO2 MONITORING CANNOT. ALTHOUGH TRADITIONAL TRANSCUTANEOUS MONITORS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF NON-INVASIVE MEASUREMENT, THE MEASUREMENT NEEDS A 15-20-MINUTE HEATING PERIOD TO REACH STABLE VALUES DESPITE RAISING THE SKIN TEMPERATURE TO 42C OR HIGHER.

AMONG THESE FACTORS, THE INADEQUATE USE OF PPE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A ONE-THIRD HIGHER RISK OF INFECTION. GIVEN THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF INFECTION, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF MONITORING AND PROMOTING ADHERENCE WITH APPROPRIATE PPE USE AMONG HCWS.

OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, COLLAGEN-BASED SCAFFOLDS HAVE BECOME VITAL TO SURGEONS BY PROVIDING A PLATFORM FOR TISSUE REVASCULARIZATION AND RECONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER, THEIR SLOW RANDOM VASCULARIZATION UPON IMPLANTATION OFTEN LEADS TO FAILURE AND PREVENTS TRUE RECAPITULATION OF NATIVE TISSUE VASCULAR HIERARCHY.

CERENKOV-ACTIVATED AGENTS FOR IMAGING AND THERAPY - SUMMARY. THE PROBLEM: CERENKOV LUMINESCENCE (CL) IMAGING (CLI) IS A NEW IMAGING METHOD THAT UTILIZES LIGHT EMITTED DURING THE DECAY OF RADIOTRACERS. IN CONTRAST TO FLUORESCENCE IMAGING, WHERE CURRENTLY ONLY VERY FEW AGENTS ARE CLINICALLY AVAILABLE, CLI CAN TAP INTO THE WEALTH OF CLINICALLY USED SPECIFIC RADIOTRACERS FOR OPTICAL IMAGING, E.G. DURING SURGERY. WE ALREADY HAVE DEMONSTRATED PRE-CLINICAL CLI APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS CLINICAL CLI. YET, DUE TO ITS VERY LOW SIGNAL INTENSITY THE VERSATILITY OF CL REMAINS LIMITED. IMAGING REQUIRES STRICT EXCLUSION OF AMBIENT LIGHT, AND CL-MEDIATED PHOTOACTIVATION DEMANDS UNREALISTIC HIGH DOSES. PROPOSED SOLUTION: TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT WE COULD (I) EXPLORE THE SHORT-WAVE INFRARED (SWIR) PART OF THE CERENKOV SPECTRUM FOR CLI UNDER AMBIENT LIGHT (AIM 1); AND (II) UTILIZE CLINICAL RADIOTRACERS TOGETHER WITH A HALLMARK OF CANCER CELLS TO ACTIVATE A PRODRUG IN TUMORS FOR A NEW THERAPY PARADIGM (AIM 2). WE PROPOSE THESE TWO INDEPENDENT SPECIFIC AIMS: IN AIM 1, WE WILL EXPLORE SWIR CLI IN THE SPECTRAL RANGE OF 900-1300 NM. THIS SPECTRAL RANGE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AUTOFLUORESCENCE, ABSORPTION AND SCATTER AND PROVIDES MUCH HIGHER DEPTH PENETRATION, YIELDING IMAGES WITH MUCH HIGHER CONTRAST AND RESOLUTION. THERE ARE NO CLINICAL APPROVED AGENTS OPERATING IN THIS AREA. THEORETICAL PREDICTION SHOWS THAT THE BROAD-SPECTRUM CL SHOULD HAVE ALSO A SWIR COMPONENT (ICL). WE NOW DEMONSTRATED THAT ICL CAN INDEED BE DETECTED FROM CLINICAL RADIOTRACERS USING SPECIALIZED CAMERAS. CONSIDERING THAT HUMAN EYES DETECT LIGHT FROM CA. 400 TO 700 NM IT WILL BE FEASIBLE TO USE NON-SWIR EMITTING LED LIGHTENING, ENABLING ICL IMAGING (ICLI) TO BE CARRIED OUT IN A WELL-LIT ROOM WITHOUT ANY ENCLOSURE. THIS LIBERATES CLI FROM THE MANDATORY TOTAL DARKNESS DURING IMAGING THAT REQUIRED SPECIAL ENCLOSURES AND LIMITED FURTHER CLINICAL APPLICATIONS. AIM 2 FOCUSES AROUND OR RADIOTRACER-ACTIVATED PRODRUG DOXAZOLIDINE-BORATE THAT IS ONLY ACTIVATED IN TUMORS VIA REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS). THE ROS GENERATED VIA RADIOLYSIS FROM RADIOTRACERS WILL ADD TO THE ALREADY INCREASED ROS LEVELS PRESENT AS CANCER HALLMARK IN TUMORS, PROVIDING IN COMBINATION A HIGHLY CANCER-SPECIFIC ACTIVATION MECHANISM THAT SPARES NORMAL CELLS THAT HAVE REGULATED ROS LEVELS AND ONLY SEE BACKGROUND LEVELS OF THE TRACER. THE HIGH POTENCY (IC50 OF ~5 NM) MAKES THIS AN IDEAL AGENT TO BE ACTIVATED BY RADIOTRACERS, WHICH ARE PRESENT ONLY IN VERY LOW AMOUNTS. BY ADDING ERASTIN TO FURTHER INCREASES ROS, WE CAN PHARMACOLOGICALLY ENHANCE THE THERAPY. IN ADDITION, THIS APPROACH COULD BE USED FOR OTHER DRUGS, E.G. TO TREAT SEVERE INFLAMMATORY DISEASES SUCH AS ARTHRITIS OR VASCULITIS WHERE ANTI- INFLAMMATORY DRUGS FURTHER REDUCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THESE PATIENTS. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR WORK IS NOT ONLY MOVING CL FURTHER INTO NEW REALMS BUT IS ALSO ADDING AN ENTIRELY NEW IMAGING AND THERAPY PARADIGM. THIS CONTINUATION OF OUR WORK IS SIGNIFICANT, AS WE ARE ABLE TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF NOT ONLY CL BUT ALSO TO INTRODUCE NEW THERAPY APPROACHES WITH ISOTOPES. THE UNPRECEDENTED CONCEPTS OF SWIR CL AS WELL AS RADIOTRACER-ACTIVATED DRUGS ARE HIGHLY INNOVATIVE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b514fc3a-d769-87e9-75ea-7a6766afb5ee-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56EB030512_7529"}, {"internal_id": 152369531, "Award ID": "R56EB030053", "Award Amount": 611305.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-20", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "SIMULATION BASED SURGICAL TRAINING FOR HIGH RISK LOW RESOURCED PROCEDURES USING A NOVEL SIMULATOR WITH SMART MENTORING - ABSTRACT  A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF IATROGENIC COMPLICATION IN LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY (LC) IS BILIARY INJURY DUE TO MISIDENTIFICATION OF THE CYSTIC DUCT AND ARTERY. OF THE ~750,000 LCS PERFORMED ANNUALLY, BILE DUCT INJURY OCCURS IN UP TO 0.15% OF CASES, WITH A CONCOMITANT MORTALITY RATE OF 20.8%. OF THESE ~30% OCCUR IN PROCEDURES PERFORMED BY EXPERIENCED SURGEONS, WHO HAVE COMPLETED MORE THAN 200 LC SURGERIES. THE CRITICAL VIEW OF SAFETY (CVS), ESTABLISHED BY A SOCIETY OF AMERICAN GASTROINTESTINAL AND ENDOSCOPIC SURGEONS (SAGES) TASK FORCE, LAYS OUT SPECIFIC PROCEDURAL STEPS TO AVOID BILIARY INJURY DURING LC. PRELIMINARY DATA ON VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) TRAINING OF CVS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND SWEDEN HAVE INDICATED THAT IT RESULTS IN FEWER SURGICAL ERRORS. IN THIS STUDY WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A VR CVS CURRICULUM ON A PROTOTYPE PORTABLE CAMERA AIDED SIMULATOR (PORTCAS) USING A WEB-BASED INTERACTIVE, VIRTUAL, SMART MENTORED TRAINING PROTOCOL. THE STUDY WILL CONSIST OF TWO SPECIFIC AIMS. THE FIRST AIM IS TO DEVELOP THE PORTCAS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, THE VIRTUAL SIMULATION, AND AN INTERACTIVE CLOUD-BASED SMART MENTORING TRAINING ENVIRONMENT. THE SECOND AIM IS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF THE PORTCAS TRAINING PLATFORM ON VIRTUAL AND REAL OBTAINMENT OF THE CVS BY EXPERIENCED SURGEONS.  PORTCAS COMBINES FUNCTION AND LOW COST BY USING COMPUTER VISION TO TRACK THE MOTION OF LAPAROSCOPIC TOOLS, BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN LOW-TECH SIMULATORS (LOW FIDELITY, NO FEEDBACK, LOW COST) AND HIGH-TECH SIMULATORS (HIGH FIDELITY, SOME FEEDBACK WITH MINIMAL ANALYTICS, HIGH COST). THE VISION FOR PORTCAS IS TO PROVIDE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE WAY TO AUTOMATE ASSESSMENT OF SIMULATION (FEEDBACK TO THE TRAINEE) FOR MANUAL OR MOTION- BASED TASKS. PORTCAS CAN BE EXTENDED ACROSS MANY OTHER TRAINING DISCIPLINES BESIDES LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY.  THE SMALL SIZE AND PORTABILITY OF PORTCAS MAKES IT AVAILABLE FOR MENTORED SMART TRAINING ANYWHERE/ANYTIME FOR BUSY SURGEONS, AND FOR TRAINEES AT ANY STEP OF THE LEARNING CURVE. CAMERA TRACKING IS CONDUCTED AT THE CLIENT SIDE TO MINIMIZE LATENCY WHILE THE SMART TRAINING ALGORITHMS WILL BE LOCATED IN THE CLOUD. THIS ALLOWS TRAINING REGIMENS TO BE ACCESSED REMOTELY AND REDUCES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLEXITY AT THE CLIENT LEVEL. THIS STRATEGY IS INNOVATIVE IN THAT IT REDUCES THE COST, ENABLES A LIGHTWEIGHT PORTABLE TRAINING DEVICE AND CENTRALIZES THE LEARNING PARADIGMS AND INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE AND TAILORED SMART MENTORING IN THE CLOUD SERVER. THE TRAINING WILL EVALUATE PROGRESS IN BOTH TECHNICAL MASTERY AND EXPERT JUDGEMENT IN PRACTICING SURGEONS USING INTRA-SURGICAL IMAGES OF THE CVS. UNLIKE TRAINING TOOLBOXES OR VIDEO TRAINERS, VR-BASED SIMULATORS EXPOSE TRAINEES TO RARE ADVERSE EVENTS, ALLOW CUSTOMIZATION BASED ON INDIVIDUAL NEEDS, ALLOW FOR SUBTLE MEASUREMENT OF THE TRAINEE'S PERFORMANCE, AND PROVIDE VERY DETAILED AND OBJECTIVE FEEDBACK IN REAL TIME, INDEPENDENT OF A PROCTOR. WE EXPECT THAT EFFECTIVELY TRAINING SURGEONS IN INTRA-OPERATIVE ATTAINMENT OF CVS, USING BOTH NORMAL AND UNUSUAL VASCULOBILIARY ANATOMY SIMULATIONS, WILL REDUCE THE INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY CAUSED BY IATROGENIC BILIARY INJURY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NE", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b80a61bf-aab0-2f35-db05-67fd682ea201-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56EB030053_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140059241, "Award ID": "R56EB028287", "Award Amount": 492943.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-06", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "A FULLY AUTOMATED PET RADIOMICS FRAMEWORK - SUMMARY THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A FULLY AUTOMATED PET RADIOMICS FRAMEWORK AND EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF PET RADIOMIC FEATURES (RFS) DERIVED FROM THIS FRAMEWORK IN PREDICTING THERAPY RESPONSE IN PATIENTS WITH STAGE III NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC). RADIOMICS IS SHOWING EXCITING PROMISE IN DERIVING BIOMARKERS FOR SEVERAL DISEASES. THE POTENTIAL TO MEASURE AND EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF RADIOMIC FEATURES DERIVED FROM PET FOR EARLY PREDICTION OF THERAPY RESPONSE IS HIGHLY IMPACTFUL SINCE PET PROBES THE FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TUMOR, WHERE CHANGES ARE MANIFESTED SOONER IN COMPARISON TO ANATOMICAL CHANGES. HOWEVER, PET IMAGES HAVE HIGH NOISE AND LIMITED RESOLUTION, WHICH LEADS TO INACCURATE AND IMPRECISE RF MEASUREMENTS THAT THEN HAVE LIMITED CLINICAL VALUE. PREVIOUSLY WE HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNIQUES TO OPTIMIZE QUANTITATIVE IMAGING METHODS AND SHOWN THAT THESE CAN HELP ESTIMATE MORE RELIABLE QUANTITATIVE METRICS LEADING TO BETTER PREDICTIVE ABILITY WITH THESE METRICS. BUILDING ON THESE PAST STUDIES AND BY COMBINING CONCEPTS FROM IMAGING PHYSICS, STATISTICAL INFERENCE THEORY, DEEP LEARNING, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP METHODS THAT ACCURATELY AND PRECISELY ESTIMATE RFS FROM PET. THESE METHODS WILL INCLUDE A FULLY AUTOMATED PET SEGMENTATION METHOD THAT WILL ENABLE RELIABLE DELINEATION OF TUMOR BOUNDARIES USING A PRACTICAL APPROACH. NEXT, A NO-GOLD-STANDARD (NGS) EVALUATION TECHNIQUE WILL BE DEVELOPED TO OPTIMIZE RF QUANTIFICATION PROTOCOLS. THIS TECHNIQUE WILL PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF RFS FROM PET IMAGES WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE GROUND TRUTH RF VALUE. THE METHODS WILL BE RIGOROUSLY VALIDATED IN THE CONTEXT OF MEASURING RADIOMICS FEATURES IN PATIENTS WITH NSCLC USING A COMBINATION OF REALISTIC SIMULATIONS, PHYSICAL PHANTOM STUDIES AND EXISTING PATIENT DATA.

THE PROPOSED METHODS ARE POISED TO HAVE A STRONG IMPACT ON PET RADIOMICS BY ENABLING MEASUREMENT OF PRECISE AND ACCURATE RFS, AND BY FACILITATING THE CLINICAL TRANSLATION OF PET RADIOMICS. THE IMPACT IS STRENGTHENED AS WE INVESTIGATE THE PREDICTIVE ABILITY OF THE PET RFS IN PATIENTS WITH STAGE III NSCLC, A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH WITH LOW OVERALL SURVIVAL, AND WITH AN IMPORTANT AND TIMELY NEED FOR IMPROVED PERSONALIZED THERAPY REGIMENS.

IN CONTRAST TO LEARNING PARADIGMS THAT DEPEND ON THE EXPERT ANNOTATION OF IMAGES (E.G., DELINEATING TUMOR REGIONS) AND ARE THEREFORE TIME-INTENSIVE AND LIMITED TO SMALLER COHORTS, TRAINING DIRECTLY FROM WSIS USING PLLS WILL ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF REALISTIC TRAINING DATASETS CONTAINING TENS-OF-THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS THAT CAN PRODUCE MODELS WITH CLINICALLY-MEANINGFUL AC- CURACY. GPU ACCELERATORS HAVE PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ADVANCING DEEP LEARNING METHODS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY TOOLS. MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORKS (MLFS), E.G., PYTORCH AND TENSORFLOW, PROVIDE RESEARCHERS WITH ABSTRACTIONS TO QUICKLY DEVELOP MODELS THAT UTILIZE GPUS. THE EVOLUTION OF GPUS AND MLFS HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE ANALYSIS OF SMALL IMAGES, AND SO APPLYING THESE TOOLS DIRECTLY TO WSIS OR OTHER LARGE MEDICAL IMAGES LIKE VOLUMETRIC MAGNETIC RESONANCE OR COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IS CHALLENGING. ADAPTING MEDICAL IMAGING PROBLEMS TO THE SMALL IMAGE PARADIGM LEADS TO MANY COMPROMISES RESULTING IN SUBOPTIMAL PERFORMANCE, INCREASED IMPLE- MENTATION EFFORT, AND INCREASED SOFTWARE/DESIGN COMPLEXITY (E.G., PATCH BASED TECHNIQUES OR MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING). AS A RESULT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCALABLE ML MODELS FROM PLLS BY DIRECTLY PROCESSING WSI IMAGES THROUGH A DEEP LEARNING PIPELINE IS INFEASIBLE TODAY ON GPUS. RECENT EFFORTS THAT USE UNIFIED GPU MEMORY OR STREAMING APPROACHES TO OVERCOME GPU MEMORY LIMITS AND ATTEMPT TO PERFORM END-TO-END TRAINING AT WSI SCALE HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE TO ANNOTATION OR MIL. HOWEVER, THESE APPROACHES ARE EITHER SLOW (DUE TO SUBOPTIMAL DATA MOVEMENT STRATEGIES), COMPLEX TO ADAPT/USE, OR HIGHLY SPECIFIC TO A GIVEN NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (LIMITING THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND EXPLORE NEW ARCHITECTURES). MORE GENERAL-PURPOSE, EFFICIENT, AND USER-FRIENDLY FRAMEWORKS ARE NEEDED TO ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF WSI SCALE DEEP LEARNING.  THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A ROBUST SOFTWARE FRAMEWORK TO FACILITATE SEAMLESS DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF SCALABLE ML MODELS, WITHOUT THE IMPOSITION OF ANY LIMITS ON THE SIZES OF HANDLED IMAGES, UNHINDERED BY THE LIMITED MEMORY CAPACITY IN GPUS. THE PROPOSED SSTEP (SEAMLESS SCALABLE TENSOR-EXPRESSION EXECUTION VIA PARTITIONING) SOFT- WARE FRAMEWORK WILL ALLOW SCALABLE AND PORTABLE NEURAL NETWORK MODELS THAT DIRECTLY PROCESS FULL HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGES OF ARBITRARY SIZE FOR TRAINING OR INFERENCE, ON ANY (MULTI) GPU PLATFORM.

CLINICAL SIGNICANCE COMES FROM THE 230,000 PATIENTS PER YEAR (IN THE USA ALONE) WITH LARGER STONE SIZES, FOR WHOM SURGEONS CURRENTLY FACE A DILEMMA. THEY MUST EITHER CHOOSE INVASIVE SURGERY, OR PERFORM A LENGTHY URETEROSCOPY WHICH INCREASES COMPLICATION RATES, AND CONSUMES EXCESSIVE OPERATING ROOM TIME. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT BY INCREASING LASER AND BASKET DEXTERITY, OUR NEW DEVICE WILL REDUCE THE PROCEDURE TIME BY MORE THAN 25% FOR PATIENTS WITH LARGER STONES. ACHIEVING THIS WOULD MAKE MANY MORE PATIENTS CANDIDATES FOR URETEROSCOPY; IT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REMOVE LARGER STONES ALMOST AS QUICKLY AS SMALLER STONES ARE REMOVED TODAY. INNOVATION COMES FROM HARNESSING ELASTIC INTERACTIONS IN ASYMMETRICALLY STIFF, THIN-WALLED TUBES TO CREATE A STEERABLE AIMING TIP THAT IS (1) SMALL ENOUGH TO PASS THROUGH A STANDARD URETEROSOCOPE PORT, WHILE (2) CARRYING A LASER BER OR KIDNEY STONE BASKET WITHIN ITS OPEN CENTRAL LUMEN. THE STIFFNESS ASYMMETRY OF THE TUBES (WHICH ARE ATTACHED AT THEIR TIPS) TRANSFORMS SMALL AXIAL MOTIONS APPLIED AT THE ENDOSCOPE HANDLE INTO DEXTEROUS LOCAL BENDING AT THE ENDOSCOPE TIP.

THIS SIGNIFICANT USE HAS RAISED NOTABLE CONCERNS REGARDING UTILIZATION COSTS, INAPPROPRIATE APPLICATIONS, AND THE ASSOCIATED RADIATION RISK. A RECENT MEDICARE REPORTS HUNDREDS OF HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE NEEDLESSLY SCANNED THEIR PATIENTS TWICE ON THE SAME DAY. UNNECESSARY REPEATED SCANS EXPOSE PATIENTS TO EXTRA RADIATION WHILE INCREASE EXPENSE, DECREASE REIMBURSEMENT, AND INCREASE LIABILITY FOR THE PROVIDERS. THUS, THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ENCOURAGED AND MANDATED STRICTER OVERSIGHT OF MEDICAL IMAGING USAGE AND ITS ASSOCIATED RADIATION. CONCURRENT TO THE MANDATE TO BETTER MANAGE IMAGING RISK IS TO ENSURE ITS VALUE: ONE OF THE QUINTESSENTIAL BUT MOST UNDERSTATED PILLARS OF CURRENT CT PRACTICE IS CT\u2019S HIGH VALUE IN CARING FOR ILLNESS AND INJURY ACROSS ALL AGES. TO ENSURE THIS BENEFIT OF CT EXAMINATIONS, THERE NEEDS TO BE A CAREFUL BALANCE BETWEEN IMAGE QUALITY AND RADIATION SAFETY. A POOR QUALITY, OVERLY LOW DOSE EXAM IS A DISSERVICE TO THE CARE OF THE PATIENT WHILE AN EXAM WITH MORE RADIATION DOSE THAN NECESSARY CAN UNDERMINE ITS SAFETY. THEREFORE, PROPER CT IMAGING REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE COMBINED QUALITY AND DOSE MONITORING PROGRAM ON A PATIENT-BY-PATIENT BASIS TO PROPERLY UNDERSTAND, MANAGE, AND MITIGATE RADIATION RISK. UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENTLY THERE IS NO SUCH SOFTWARE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY MONITOR CT RADIATION DOSE AND ITS CORRESPONDING IMAGE QUALITY.

BUT LSO, AFTER YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT, HAS REACHED ITS PERFORMANCE LIMIT, ESPECIALLY FOR THE SCANNERS WITH A LONG AXIAL FIELD OF VIEW (AFOV) THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED. THE GOAL OF THESE SCANNERS IS TO INCREASE THE GEOMETRICAL COVERAGE AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE DETECTION SENSITIVITY (BY A FACTOR OF 30-40), THEREBY REDUCING THE SCANNING TIMES (30-40 TIMES FASTER) OR THE PATIENT\u2019S RADIATION EXPOSURE.  HOWEVER, LONG AFOV SCANNERS FACE TWO MAIN CHALLENGES: GREATER DEPTH-OF-INTERACTION (DOI) EFFECTS, WHICH INCREASE BLURRING AND NOISE; AND AN INCREASE IN THE VOLUME REQUIRED FOR THE CONSTITUENT CRYSTALS, WHICH MAKE UP SOME 50% OF THE COST OF THE ENTIRE SCANNER. THE USE OF SHORTER CRYSTALS CAN COUNTERACT BOTH THE DOI EFFECTS AND THE INCREASED CRYSTAL VOLUME (HENCE COST), BUT WITH A MAJOR LOSS OF DETECTION EFFICIENCY, DEFEATING THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE. ANOTHER APPROACH FOR REDUCING DOI EFFECTS IS A DOUBLE-ENDED READ-OUT BUT THIS INCREASES BOTH COST AND SYSTEM COMPLEXITY. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE VIABLE AND AFFORDABLE LONG AFOV SCANNERS, A NEW SCINTILLATION MATERIAL IS REQUIRED THAT WOULD PROVIDE HIGHER STOPPING POWER THAN LSO, WITH SIMILAR OR BETTER TIMING PROPERTIES, AND AT A LOWER COST.  THESE REQUIREMENTS CAN BE MET BY A SCINTILLATOR BASED ON TLCL. THIS HOST HAS A COMPARABLE DENSITY (7.0 G/CM3 VS. 7.4 G/CM3 FOR LSO) AND A MUCH HIGHER EFFECTIVE Z OF 77 (VS. 65 TO LSO.)

THE PROPOSED LIGHT ENGINEERING MODULAR SYSTEM ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL NEED FOR FLEXIBLE IMAGING TECHNIQUES TO IMAGE LIVE WHOLE CELLS WITH LOW PHOTODAMAGE AND PHOTOTOXICITY WHILE PROVIDING HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION AS WELL AS A LARGE VOLUMETRIC FIELD OF VIEW. DESPITE EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCES IN OPTICAL MICROSCOPY, THE AVAILABILITY OF STATE-OF-THE-ART COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS HAS BEEN SLOW TO MARKET, LACKING IN FLEXIBILITY AND EASE OF ACCESS. THE MODULAR INSTRUMENT IS BASED ON AN INTEGRATED DESIGN OF THE ILLUMINATION, 3D OPTICAL RESPONSE, DATA COLLECTION, AND RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS FOR FLUORESCENCE IMAGING. SPECIFICALLY, ENGINEERED 3D LIGHT EXCITATION LIMITS THE BACKGROUND NOISE WHILE REDUCING PHOTODAMAGE AND PHOTOTOXICITY. THE ENGINEERED 3D POINT SPREAD FUNCTIONS ENABLE MULTIPLEX FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDING AN EXTENDED DEPTH OF FIELD IMAGING, HIGH-SENSITIVITY 3D LOCALIZATION OF SINGLE-MOLECULES OR CELLULAR HETEROGENEITIES, MULTI-COLOR, AND 3D IMAGING. AS A RESULT, THE TARGET PERFORMANCE OUTPERFORMS THE STATE OF THE ART IN TERMS OF SPATIAL/TEMPORAL RESOLUTION, SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO, FIELD OF VIEW, SINGLE-MOLECULE LOCALIZATION PRECISION, AND EASE OF USE. THIS PROJECT IS TARGETED TOWARDS COMMERCIALIZATION OF A COST-EFFECTIVE MODULAR SOLUTION THAT CAN BE EASILY INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING SCIENTIFIC MICROSCOPES. THE COMMERCIAL-READY PROTOTYPE, WILL INCLUDE A SMALL FOOTPRINT ARCHITECTURE, A SET OF NOVEL OPTICAL PHASE MASKS FOR POINT SPREAD FUNCTION ENGINEERING AND EXCITATION SHAPING, A ROBUST OPTOMECHANICAL DESIGN, AND REAL-TIME EXPERIMENT CONTROL SOFTWARE. TESTS OF THE INSTRUMENT IN SIGNIFICANT BIOMEDICAL PROBLEMS AT PARTNERS\u2019 LABS WILL VALIDATE END-USER ACCEPTANCE AND PROVIDE VALUABLE FEEDBACK TOWARDS COMMERCIALIZATION. THE IMPLICATIONS IN BIOMEDICAL IMAGING ARE FAR-REACHING. FOR INSTANCE, THE INSTRUMENT WOULD BENEFIT THE STUDY OF ONCOGENESIS, OWING TO ITS DEGREE OF MOLECULAR SENSITIVITY FOR DETECTING THE SPATIAL LOCALIZATION OF RECEPTORS AND OTHER SIGNALING MOLECULES WITHIN THE TUMOR/EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX. IT WOULD ALSO EMPOWER THE STUDY OF DEGENERATIVE DISEASES WHERE THE INSTRUMENT CAN HELP REVEAL THEIR MOLECULAR ORIGIN AND DEVELOP NOVEL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES.

MRI-GUIDANCE HAS BEEN USED FOR PERCUTANEOUS NEEDLE INJECTIONS TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT NEUROPATHIC PAIN, PERFORM NEEDLE BIOPSY, DRAINAGE, TUMOR ABLATION, AND OTHER CLINICAL INDICATIONS. IN A PEDIATRIC SETTING, THERE IS A PREFERENCE FOR MR AND ULTRASOUND OVER CT AND X-RAY IMAGING BECAUSE NO IONIZING RADIATION IS EMITTED. FURTHER, MR IMAGES ARE BETTER FOR VISUALIZATION OF MSK SOFT TISSUE AND BONE LESIONS AND WOULD BE PREFERRED BY CLINICIANS BUT FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME TO PERFORM REAL-TIME NEEDLE INSERTIONS UNDER MR GUIDANCE, AND THE POOR ERGONOMICS OF IN-BORE INSERTIONS. ACCURATE AND RAPID DIAGNOSIS OF BONE TUMORS AND OTHER SUSPICIOUS BONE LESIONS IN CHILDREN IS ESSENTIAL TO APPROPRIATE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT. BONE BIOPSY PROCEDURES IN CHILDREN REQUIRE HIGHER TARGETING PRECISION AND ACCURACY DUE TO THEIR SMALLER SIZES. MRI-GUIDED BONE BIOPSY IS NOT ROUTINELY USED BECAUSE OF CURRENT LIMITATIONS IN TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY. THE \u201cADVANCE AND CHECK\u201d TECHNIQUE WHEREBY THE NEEDLE TRAJECTORY IS GUIDED/MONITORED BY INTERMEDIATE SCANS HAS BEEN TRANSLATED FROM THE CT ENVIRONMENT, BUT THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS WELL IN THE CT ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OF QUICK IMAGE ACQUISITIONS AND SHORT SCANNER BORES. IT IS MUCH MORE TIME CONSUMING AND MUCH LESS CONVENIENT IN THE MRI ENVIRONMENT. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE II EFFORT IS TO ADAPT THE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED IN THE PHASE I TO ASSIST CLINICIANS IN ACCURATE AND FAST IMAGE-GUIDED INSTRUMENT PLACEMENT WHEN USING ONLY MRI SCANS. THE PROPOSED NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR MRI-GUIDED INTERVENTIONS WILL IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF CARE BY USING COMPUTER VISION AND HARDWARE ADVANCES TO BECOME A NEARLY HANDS-OFF COMPANION DEVICE TO THE OPERATOR, AUTOMATICALLY PERFORMING MANY STEPS WHICH CURRENTLY REQUIRE USER INPUT. THE LUMENA SYSTEM PROJECTS THE GUIDANCE FEEDBACK DIRECTLY ONTO THE INTERVENTION SITE AS WELL AS ON A MONITOR. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE INTERVENTIONALIST TO KEEP THEIR FOCUS ON THE INSERTION SITE INSTEAD OF THE MONITOR WHICH IS OFTEN NOT IN FRONT OF THEM. THE PROJECTED FEEDBACK IS SIMPLE TO FOLLOW AND CAN BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD WHICH MAKES THE SYSTEM INTUITIVE WITH ALMOST NO LEARNING CURVE.

UPPER-EXTREMITY STROKE-THERAPY DEVICE - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE-II PROJECT PROPOSES THE DEPLOYMENT OF AN AI-POWERED IMAGE-PROCESSING TOOL, NAMED POSTURECHECK\u2122, TO AUTOMATICALLY DETECT WHEN PATIENTS PERFORM UNDESIRABLE COMPENSATORY MOVEMENTS DURING ROBOT-ASSISTED UPPER-EXTREMITY (UE) REHABILITATION EXERCISES. THE SYSTEM IS BASED ON A STANDARD VIDEO CAMERA AND THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) SOFTWARE DEVELOPED UNDER THE NIH PHASE-I PROJECT. POSTURECHECK\u2122 WILL BE FULLY INTEGRATED WITH BARRETT TECHNOLOGY'S EXISTING BURT\u00ae UE REHABILITATION ROBOT, ENSURING THAT PATIENTS ARE PROVIDED APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY FEEDBACK TO ENCOURAGE THE CORRECT PERFORMANCE OF THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES WITHOUT REQUIRING CONSTANT THERAPIST SUPERVISION.  BURT\u00ae IS AN FDA-LISTED UE REHABILITATION ROBOT THAT SUPPORTS THE WEIGHT OF A PATIENT'S ARM AND HAND WHILE THE PATIENT MOVES HIS/HER ARM TO INTERACT WITH ON-SCREEN GAMES. BURT\u00ae OFFERS GUIDED ASSISTANCE, VISUAL AND HAPTIC FEEDBACK, AND ACTIVITIES AND ASSESSMENTS TO BOTH HELP TRAIN THE PATIENT AND MEASURE PROGRESS. CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT BURT\u00ae CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENTS' PERFORMANCE IN ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS WITH A THERAPIST. HOWEVER, THE SYSTEM LACKS THE CAPABILITY FOR A SINGLE THERAPIST TO MONITOR AND WORK WITH SEVERAL PATIENTS AND BURT\u00ae SYSTEMS AT ONE TIME.  THE PROPOSED SBIR PHASE-II ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED IN THREE AIMS. IN AIM 1, THE ANNOTATED DATASET GENERATED IN PHASE-I WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP THREE SEPARATE AI MODULES. THESE MODULES WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO A FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS THERAPISTS TO MONITOR THE OUTCOME OF THE MODULES, AND, THROUGH FEEDBACK, ENABLE THE SYSTEM TO AUTO- ADAPT TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE CONTINUOUSLY. IN AIM 2, STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WILL BE GATHERED AND INTEGRATED TO DESIGN MULTIPLE USER INTERFACES FOR THE POSTURECHECK\u2122 TOOL. SPECIFIC INTERFACES WILL BE CREATED FOR USE BY THERAPISTS DURING AND AFTER RT SESSIONS. POSTURECHECK\u2122 WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH THE BURT\u00ae DEVICE TO EMPOWER THERAPISTS TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE FEEDBACK TO PATIENTS AND DETER THE USE OF COMPENSATORY MOVEMENTS. FINALLY, IN AIM 3, FORTY-TWO STROKE SURVIVORS WILL BE RECRUITED IN AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY DEPLOYING THE POSTURECHECK\u2122 AND BURT\u00ae SYSTEMS. SUBJECTS WILL UNDERGO EIGHTEEN RT SESSIONS IN EITHER AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP THERAPY FORMAT. MOTOR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN GROUPS WILL BE COMPARED TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF THE COMBINED SYSTEMS FOR MULTI-PATIENT RT THERAPY IN FUTURE REHABILITATION CENTERS.  THE LONG-TERM COMMERCIAL GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE A PRACTICAL BURT\u00ae-PLUS-POSTURECHECK\u2122 SYSTEM TO EMPOWER THERAPISTS TO SUPERVISE MULTIPLE PATIENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGH A GAMUT OF USEFUL FUNCTIONALITIES.

AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MANY GASTROINTESTINAL, UROLOGICAL, AND KIDNEY DISEASES. ENDOSCOPES HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN REUSABLE AND ARE CLEANED WITH HIGH LEVEL DISINFECTION (HLD) BETWEEN PATIENTS. PUBLICATIONS AND REPORTS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE SHOWN THAT ENDOSCOPES ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEANED BETWEEN PATIENTS, RESULTING IN UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF INFECTION TRANSMISSION AMONG PATIENTS AND EVEN PATIENT DEATHS. THIS HAS BECOME A PARTICULAR CONCERN AMONG COMPLEX ENDOSCOPES SUCH AS DUODENOSCOPES, HOWEVER THE RISK OF INFECTION TRANSMISSION IS NOT UNIQUE AND EXTENDS ACROSS ALL FLEXIBLE ENDOSCOPES INCLUDING DUODENOSCOPES, BRONCHOSCOPES, GASTROSCOPES, URETEROSCOPES, AND COLONOSCOPES. DISPOSABLE ENDOSCOPES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS STERILITY BUT THESE USUALLY OFFER INFERIOR PERFORMANCE (INCLUDING MANIPULABILITY AS WELL AS IMAGE QUALITY) COMPARED TO EXISTING REUSABLE ENDOSCOPES WHICH HAS IMPEDED CLINICIAN ADOPTION.  ELEMENTS ENDOSCOPY IS TAKING A NOVEL APPROACH TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY DEVELOPING A MODULAR FLEXIBLE ENDOSCOPY SYSTEM THAT LIGHTLY ROBOTICIZES THE ENDOSCOPE TO REMOVE INFECTION RISK, IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE PER PROCEDURE COST. THE BREAKTHROUGH IS SEPARATING THE HANDLE FROM THE FLEXIBLE PORTION OF THE ENDOSCOPE, ALLOWING THE FLEXIBLE PORTION TO BECOME SINGLE USE AND BE DISCARDED AFTER EVERY USE, ELIMINATING PATIENT TO PATIENT CONTAMINATION RISK. THE REUSABLE HANDLE HOUSES ACTUATORS THAT CONNECT TO PULL WIRES IN THE SEPARABLE FLEXIBLE PORTION OF THE ENDOSCOPE. SOFTWARE WILL BE USED TO ENHANCE DEVICE HANDLING PERFORMANCE AND CLOSELY MATCH THE BEHAVIOR OF EXISTING REUSABLE ENDOSCOPES THAT ARE PREFERRED BY CLINICIANS. OUR DESIGN ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF CONTAMINATION WHILE OFFERING ENHANCED PERFORMANCE AT A LOWER PER PROCEDURE COST.  IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL REFINE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF EXISTING ENDOSCOPE PERFORMANCE, ITERATE OUR DESIGN FOR BOTH A DUODENOSCOPE AND A COLONOSCOPE BODY, AND CONFIRM THAT WE CAN MATCH THE MECHANICAL HANDLING PERFORMANCE OF THE PREFERRED REUSABLE DEVICES NOW IN USE. MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE WILL BE TESTED IN BENCHTOP EXPERIMENTS AND WITH ADVANCED DEVICE PROTOTYPES TESTED IN RELEVANT PHANTOM MODELS BY EXPERIENCED PHYSICIANS TO ASSESS USABILITY.

CURRENTLY, NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT EXISTS FOR ICUAW, AND THE FOCUS IS PRIMARILY ON EARLY MOBILITY PREVENTIVE MEASURES. CURRENT EARLY MOBILITY PROGRAM IS EXECUTED BY PHYSICAL THERAPY AND REQUIRES PATIENT\u2019S COOPERATION AND COULD NOT BE PERFORMED IMMEDIATELY AFTER ICU ADMISSION IN CRITICALLY ILL/MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS.

IN ADDITION, OUR SYSTEMS LOW PRODUCTION COSTS DUE TO PARALLEL FABRICATION OF MULTIPLE IMPLANTS ON ONE GLASS WAFER WILL IMPROVE THE SHORT-TERM COST EFFECTIVENESS (CURRENTLY @ 40%) TO ITS LONG TERM COST EFFECTIVENESS (80%) MAKING THIS A MAINSTREAM ELECTROCEUTICAL FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT AND IN TURN REDUCING DEPENDENCE ON OPIOIDS FOR CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS. WE WILL PERFORM FEASIBILITY STUDY ON ALL CRITICAL COMPONENTS AND ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE IN PHASE 1 ALLOWING US TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL PROTOTYPE DURING PHASE 2.

SCS THERAPY FOR CHRONIC BACK PAIN IS OUR PRIME TARGET SPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE IS HIGH LEVEL OF EVIDENCE FOR SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND LONG-TERM COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SCS WITH MORE THAN HALF OF ALL PATIENTS EXPERIENCING SUSTAINED AND SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF PAIN REDUCTION FOLLOWING SCS TREATMENT.

REPETITIVE PATIENT EXPOSURE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DOUBLE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER IN WOMEN; MEANWHILE, SURGEON EXPOSURE IS ALSO CONCERNING. ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ARE 5X MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP CANCER IN THEIR LIFETIME; SPINE SURGEONS RECEIVE UP TO 12X MORE RADIATION EXPOSURE COMPARED TO OTHER ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS. WITH MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY BECOMING WIDELY ADOPTED IN RECENT YEARS, THE USE OF FLUOROSCOPY HAS GREATLY INCREASED. SURGEONS RELY ON THE NAVIGATION PROVIDED BY FLUOROSCOPY DURING THESE PROCEDURES, AS THEY DO NOT HAVE DIRECT VISUALIZATION OF THE ANATOMY. THEREFORE, REDUCING THE RADIATION EXPOSURE FROM FLUOROSCOPY WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH IMAGING QUALITY IS A HIGH PRIORITY. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) METHODS HAVE SHOWN PROMISING ADVANCES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING. SUBTLE MEDICAL INC.

CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE IS MULTIFACTORIAL AND CAN BE BROUGHT UPON FROM DAMAGES RANGING FROM VIRAL HEPATITIS INFECTION TO ALCOHOL ABUSE TO POOR DIET. LEADING THESE IS THE EPIDEMIC OF NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS (NASH), BUT ALL CHRONIC LIVER DISEASES PROGRESS TO LIVER FIBROSIS IF UNCHECKED. FIBROSIS MAY RESOLVE FOLLOWING EFFECTIVE TREATMENT, BUT WHEN LEFT UNTREATED LIVER FIBROSIS CAN PROGRESS TO LIVER FAILURE OR LIVER CANCER. ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS, STAGING, AND SURVEILLANCE OF LIVER FIBROSIS IS KEY TO CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE PATIENT MANAGEMENT. THE PRESENT STANDARD OF CARE FOR DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING OF LIVER FIBROSIS IS BIOPSY, WHICH RUNS THE RISK OF INTERNAL BLEEDING, SAMPLES ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF LIVER, AND SUFFERS FROM INTEROBSERVER VARIABILITY.  FIBROSIS STAGE, AND NOT STEATOSIS NOR INFLAMMATION, IS THE ONLY FEATURE OF DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE OUTCOMES IN NASH. BESIDES BIOPSY WE LACK GOOD TOOLS TO NONINVASIVELY DETECT LIVER FIBROSIS, STAGE FIBROSIS, OR MONITOR RESPONSE TO TREATMENT. ELASTOGRAPHY METHODS ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO EARLY CHANGES IN DISEASE. SERUM BIOMARKERS AND BIOMARKER PANELS TO IDENTIFY NASH AND/OR LIVER FIBROSIS, ARE ALSO LIMITED AND LACK ACCURACY FOR STAGING. NONE OF THESE TECHNIQUES HAS THE ACCURACY TO MONITOR TREATMENT. AN ACCURATE, SAFE METHOD TO DIAGNOSE AND MONITOR NASH AND ASSOCIATED FIBROSIS IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN BOTH CLINICAL PRACTICE AND CLINICAL RESEARCH.

MONITORING - 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THIS SBIR PHASE I PROJECT WILL DESIGN AND DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE, MINIATURE, BATTERY-LESS, DISPOSABLE CARDIAC BIOSENSOR, TO PROVIDE EASY HOME ASSESSMENT OF HEART AND LUNG FUNCTION. THE BIOSENSOR WILL DELIVER COMPARABLE HEMODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS TO THE GOLD STANDARD ASSESSMENTS. ECONOMIC IMPETUS HAS LED TO EARLY DISCHARGE OF COMPLEX AND ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. OLDER ADULTS DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITALS FOLLOWING DIAGNOSES OF CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE EXACERBATION, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING SURGERY OR OTHER HIGH-RISK CARDIAC PROCEDURES ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR RE-HOSPITALIZATIONS AND INCREASED MORTALITY RESULTING FROM GAPS IN CARE FOLLOWING HOSPITAL DISCHARGE. THE ASSESSMENT SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENT MONITORING AT HOME, NAMELY, BLOOD PRESSURE, WEIGHT, ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS, HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED REDUCTION IN READMISSION FOR ANY REASON OR DEATH OF ANY CAUSES AFTER DISCHARGE. INVASIVE IMPLANT DEVICES, SUCH AS CARDIOMEMS, HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT HEMODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS ALLOW MORE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT LEADING TO FEWER HOSPITALIZATIONS AND LOWER DEATHS. THUS, AGING ADULTS ARE IN NEED OF RELIABLE, ROBUST, SAFE (NON-INVASIVE), AND SIMPLE TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN PROVIDE HEMODYNAMIC ASSESSMENT POST HOSPITALIZATION. THERE IS NEED FOR MEANINGFUL INTERVENTIONS THROUGH A PHONE CONSULTATION OR OUTPATIENT PRIMARY CARE VISITS THAT REDUCE RE-ADMISSIONS AND MORTALITY. USING THIS SBIRS TECHNOLOGY, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR A PATIENT TO HAVE ACCESS TO GOLD STANDARD HEMODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS, THROUGH AN INTEGRATED, WEARABLE, BATTERY-LESS, CARDIAC BIOSENSOR. THE BIOSENSOR\u2019S DATA CAN BE READ WITH A SMART PHONE USING SECURE NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION, ENABLING PATIENTS AND THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THEIR HEMODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS VIA A SMARTPHONE APPLICATION. EARLY OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENTS OF HEMODYNAMIC CHANGES WILL LEAD TO EARLY AND PROMPT OUTPATIENT INTERVENTIONS. THIS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC CARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS ENABLING THEM TO REMAIN AT HOME LONGER. WE HAVE A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF SCIENTISTS AND PRACTICE STAKEHOLDERS WHO WILL WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL THAT WILL BE APPLICABLE ACROSS DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATIONS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN MEANINGFULLY ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS AND ADDRESS THEIR UNIQUE PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES. FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE WILL BE A BIOSENSOR THAT TRULY ADDRESSES THE MARKET NEED OF AN UN-OBSTRUCTIVE, NON-INVASIVE, ACCURATE, ABSOLUTE AND ACTIONABLE SYSTEM FOR POST-DISCHARGE USE AT HOME. THIS WILL FACILITATE CLOSE SELF-MONITORING AND OUTPATIENT MONITORING OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS, WHILE MAINTAINING CLOSE SUPERVISION BY THE HEALTH CARE TEAMS. THIS BATTERY-LESS, DISPOSABLE BIOSENSOR TECHNOLOGY FOR PROVIDING IN-DEPTH HEMODYNAMICS HAS ADDITIONAL FAR REACHING BENEFITS.

TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR HCC VARY WITH THE STAGE OF DETECTION, WITH EARLY DETEC- TION LEADING TO SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN SURVIVAL RATES. UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES FOR HCC HAVE LOW SENSITIVITY. STANDARD B-MODE ULTRASOUND IS THE RECOMMENDED SURVEILLANCE METHOD, HOWEVER, THE SEN- SITIVITY OF ULTRASOUND FOR DETECTION OF HCC DEPENDS UPON THE SIZE OF THE NODULE, THE BACKGROUND COARSENESS IN CIRRHOTIC LIVERS, AND PATIENT BODY HABITUS. REPORTED HCC LESION DETECTION RATES DURING 2D B-MODE ULTRASONIC IMAGING RANGE FROM 58-89%, WITH MUCH LOWER DETECTION RATES FOUND FOR SMALL FOCAL LIVER LESIONS IN CIRRHOTIC LIVERS. CT AND MRI ARE USED FOR CONFIRMATION AFTER A SUSPICIOUS REGION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH ULTRASOUND, BUT THESE MODALITIES ARE NOT COST-EFFECTIVE FOR SURVEILLANCE, AND IN THE CASE OF CT, POSE ADDITIONAL RADIATION RISK. COMMERCIAL 2D ULTRASONIC SHEAR WAVE ELASTICITY IMAGING (SWEI) MEASUREMENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN BY NUMEROUS GROUPS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CONTRAST FOR HCC THAN B-MODE IMAGING AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS IN HEPATIC LESION VISUALIZATION. HOWEVER, THESE SYSTEMS HAVE CHALLENGES ARISING FROM LIMITED ACOUSTIC OUTPUT, WITH RESPECT TO FRAME RATE, PENETRATION DEPTH, MEASUREMENT HETEROGENEITY IN STIFFER LIVERS. COMPLETE VOLUME ASSESS- MENT OF THE LIVER WITH 2D IMAGING ALSO EXTENDS EXAM TIME. THESE LIMITATIONS PRECLUDE ITS USE FOR WIDESPREAD HCC SCREENING. THIS WORK WILL ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS BY DEVELOPING A HIGH-POWER MATRIX ARRAY CAPABLE OF WIDE FIELD-OF-VIEW 3D SWEI IMAGING, WITH ADDITIONAL 'PUSH' CAPABILITY THAT WILL ENABLE RAPID SWEI ASSESSMENT OF THE FULL LIVER VOLUME. TO ACHIEVE THE CLINICAL OBJECTIVE, THIS PROJECT WILL INITIALLY DEVELOP 3D SWEI RESEARCH PROTOTYPE TRANSDUCERS, A PREREQUISITE FOR THE FULL DEVELOPMENT OF 3D SWEI METHODS AND APPLICATIONS. THE PROTOTYPES DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT WILL ENABLE DEVELOPMENT OF 3D SWEI IMAGING METHODS, DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE HCC SCREENING APPLICATION. THIS WILL PROVIDE A POWERFUL TOOL FOR HIGH CONTRAST HCC SCREENING AND TREATMENT MONITORING LEADING TO AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR LIVER CANCER SCREENING, ALLOWING EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTION,

INTERNATIONAL LLC, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MAYO CLINIC, PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A HIGHLY INNOVATIVE NEXT-GENERATION CLINICAL INSTRUMENT TOGETHER WITH CUSTOM USER-FRIENDLY DISPLAY AND ANALYSIS SOFTWARE. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL APPARATUS FOR VOLTAMMETRY, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, AND NEUROMODULATION (MAVEN) WILL OFFER WIRELESS VOLTAMMETRIC SENSING OF MULTIPLE NEUROTRANSMITTERS (E.G., DOPAMINE, SEROTONIN, AND ADENOSINE) AT CARBON-FIBER MICROELECTRODES. MAVEN CAN BE APPLIED TO A BROAD RANGE OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH SUBJECTS INVOLVING BRAIN NEUROSURGERIES. ALONGSIDE THESE MULTIPLE NEUROCHEMICAL SENSING CAPABILITIES, THE DEVICE WILL BE CAPABLE OF NEAR-SIMULTANEOUS ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL (E.G., ACTION AND LOCAL FIELD POTENTIALS) RECORDINGS. THE MAIN INNOVATION OF THE MAVEN SYSTEM IS TO INCLUDE STATE-OF-THE-ART VOLTAMMETRIC TECHNIQUES TO QUANTITATIVELY MEASURE BOTH PHASIC (STIMULATION-INDUCED) AND TONIC (RESTING) CONCENTRATION LEVELS OF NEUROCHEMICALS IN REAL-TIME AND NEAR-SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH OTHER RECORDING MODALITIES. THIS CAPABILITY IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, MULTIPLE CYCLIC SQUARE WAVE VOLTAMMETRY (MCSWV) WILL ENABLE SECOND-TO-SECOND QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF TONIC EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND SEROTONIN WITH EXCEPTIONAL SPATIAL RESOLUTION, SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AND MINIMAL TISSUE DISTURBANCE. THIS PROPOSAL EMPLOYS OUR UNIQUE COMBINED EXPERTISE IN NEUROSCIENCE, ELECTROCHEMISTRY, ENGINEERING, AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO VALIDATE THIS NOVEL CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTRUMENT IN PREPARATION FOR ITS USE DURING INTRAOPERATIVE CLINICAL NEUROSURGERIES. ALSO, COMBINING ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY AND ELECTROCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGIES WOULD ENABLE INVESTIGATORS TO PROBE UNEXPLORED LINKS BETWEEN THE ABNORMAL ACTIVITY OF NEURAL ELEMENTS AND THE DOPAMINERGIC, SEROTONERGIC, PURINERGIC (ADENOSINE) DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROPSYCHOPATHOLOGIES, SUCH AS PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE, ESSENTIAL TREMOR, OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER, DEPRESSION, AND EPILEPSY. OUR LARGE ANIMAL MODEL (SWINE) STUDIES EMULATING EXISTING HUMAN INTRAOPERATIVE NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION TO GUIDE AND INFORM THE FINALIZATION OF THE MAVEN DESIGN FOR USE BY THE CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE COMMUNITY IN FUTURE IDE-ENABLED MECHANISTIC CLINICAL STUDIES. OUR PROPOSAL SEEKS TO (1) FINALIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAVEN, TOGETHER WITH A SOPHISTICATED USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE INTERFACE THAT (2) MEETS DEVICE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, REGULATORY DESIGN CONTROL, AND MEDICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN AN FDA-APPROVED INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE), AND (3) USE A SWINE MODEL TO DEVELOP MAVEN STIMULATION AND RECORDING PROTOCOLS FOR USE IN EXISTING INTRAOPERATIVE NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES (E.G., DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION NEUROSURGERIES AND CORTICAL LOBECTOMIES).

DUE TO LIMITED IMAGE QUALITY, CURRENT CONE-BEAM CT (CBCT) PRODUCTS ACT NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE BUT RATHER AS A COMPLEMENT TO DIAGNOSTIC MULTI-SLICE CT (MSCT) IN MAXILLOFACIAL AND ENT IMAGING. THE EMERGING MULTI-SOURCE X-RAY SOURCE TECHNOLOGY SUGGESTS NEW DESIGNS OF CT SYSTEMS THAT MAY HAVE FASTER IMAGING SPEED, IMPROVED IMAGE QUALITY, REDUCED RADIATION EXPOSURE, AND COMPACT GEOMETRIES. TETRAHEDRON BEAM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (TBCT) IS A COMPACT VOLUMETRIC CT BASED ON LINEAR ARRAY MULTI- PIXEL X-RAY SOURCES WHICH CAN PRODUCE DIAGNOSTIC-QUALITY VOLUMETRIC IMAGES BUT IN A MUCH MORE COMPACT GEOMETRY THAN CBCT.

BECAUSE THIS PROCESS IS MANUAL AND ERROR-PRONE, THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES BY PROVIDING REAL-TIME AND AUTOMATED FEEDBACK ON THE SAMPLE QUALITY. CELLIA SCIENCE WILL ENABLE IMPROVED QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF BONE MARROW ASPIRATION PROCEDURES BY DEVELOPING A POINT-OF-CARE SCREENING INSTRUMENT. OUR APPROACH IS BASED ON A RECENTLY DEVELOPED LABEL-FREE, DEEP-ULTRAVIOLET (UV) TECHNIQUE FOR CELL IMAGING AND ANALYSIS.

THE RESULTING DEEP-UV IMAGES CAN BE GENERATED IN UNDER 3 MINUTES, MAKING THE TECHNIQUE SUITABLE FOR REAL-TIME USE DURING ASPIRATION PROCEDURES, AND ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE GIEMSA- STAINED SLIDES, WHICH TAKE OVER 45 MIN TO PROCESS. LABEL-FREE DEEP-UV IMAGING CAN BE COMBINED WITH MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION AND CLASSIFICATION, WHICH WILL ENABLE AUTOMATED QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF ASPIRATE SMEARS WITHOUT A PATHOLOGY TECHNICIAN.

INSTEAD OF REQUIRING THE USE OF THE BIOPSY CHANNEL OF THE COLONOSCOPE FOR ACCESS, THE LOW COST OCT GI PROBE WILL BE AFFIXED TO THE OUTER HOUSING OF THE ENDOSCOPE, ALLOWING THE PHYSICIAN TO EXAMINE REGIONS OF INTEREST AND THEN ACQUIRE A BIOPSY OR REMOVE A POLYP WITHOUT REMOVING THE OCT PROBE. FINALLY, WE WILL EXTEND CLINICAL UTILITY BY EXPANDING THE SPECTRAL RANGE OF THE LOW COST OCT SYSTEM TO PERMIT USE OF SOCT TO OBTAIN FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION BY QUANTITATIVELY ANALYZING THE SCATTERING AND ABSORPTION PROPERTIES OF THE TISSUE AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE DIAGNOSIS. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT: WE WILL IMPLEMENT A NEW OCT INSTRUMENT FOR EXAMINATION OF COLORECTAL POLYPS WITH POTENTIAL FOR COMMERCIAL TRANSLATION TO CLINICAL USE. THE INSTRUMENT WILL INCLUDE A LOW COST OCT ENGINE, UPGRADED TO ENABLE SPECTROSCOPIC OCT MEASUREMENTS AND A NOVEL PROBE DESIGN THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY INEXPENSIVE TO BE SINGLE USE. THE PROBE DESIGN WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS OCT EFFORTS, USING AN APPROACH WHICH FITS INTO THE ENDOSCOPIC WORKFLOW BY AVOIDING THE NEED TO INSERT AND RETRACT THE PROBE FOR MEASUREMENTS. 2) SOCT TISSUE STUDIES: THE NEW SOCT INSTRUMENT WILL BE APPLIED TO EXAMINATION OF RESECTED COLON POLYPS TO IDENTIFY OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPIC SIGNATURES OF PRE-MALIGNANCY OR ADENOMAS. THE PROBE WILL BE ALSO BE APPLIED DURING ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES TO VALIDATE ITS ABILITY TO INTERFACE WITH THE COLONIC MUCOSA WHILE ALSO PERMITTING A COLLOCATED BIOPSY TO BE ACQUIRED. ACHIEVING THESE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF LOW COST SOCT FOR EVALUATING COLORECTAL EPITHELIAL TISSUES AND PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION FOR FURTHER COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "5a540c02-f2db-f2d3-c5e9-d2bb0b7b1d42-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R41EB032693_7529"}, {"internal_id": 149791986, "Award ID": "R41EB032304", "Award Amount": 252388.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-06-30", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "SYSTEM FOR DOCUMENTING AND TRACKING SKIN LESIONS - PROJECT SUMMARY THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STTR PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM FOR LONGITUDINALLY TRACKING THE LOCATIONS AND MORPHOLOGIC CHANGES TO ALL PIGMENTED SKIN LESIONS ON THE PATIENT\u2019S BODY. THE PROPOSED SOFTWARE WILL BUILD ON A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED TOTAL BODY PHOTOGRAPHY (TBP) SYSTEM, CALLED LUMO SCANNER, THAT CAN PROVIDE UNPRECEDENTED RESOLUTION ACROSS THE ENTIRE BODY SURFACE. SKIN CANCERS, INCLUDING BOTH MELANOMA AND NON- MELANOMA, ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES. EARLY-STAGE IDENTIFICATION OF SUSPICIOUS PIGMENTED LESIONS (SPLS) IN PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS CAN LEAD TO IMPROVED MELANOMA PROGNOSIS AND A POSSIBLE 20- FOLD REDUCTION IN TREATMENT COST. THE PROPOSED DEVICE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE CLINICIANS\u2019 TIME REQUIRED FOR DOCUMENTING LESIONS AND FOR MAKING DIAGNOSTIC DECISIONS, THEREBY ALLOWING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO BETTER COPE WITH THE FORECASTED SHORTAGES OF DERMATOLOGISTS. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS NOVEL IN THAT IT: 1) PROVIDES A STANDARDIZED WAY OF REFERRING TO LESIONS\u2019 LOCATIONS, 2) ALLOWS DERMATOLOGISTS TO MAINTAIN A COMPLETE HISTORICAL RECORD OF EVERY LESION 3) DETECT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED (EVOLVED) LESIONS AND 4) ASSISTS DERMATOLOGISTS IN FINDING CANCEROUS LESIONS AT THEIR VERY EARLY STAGES TO IMPROVE OVERALL PATIENT PROGNOSIS. THE PROJECT TEAM HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED A TOTAL BODY PHOTOGRAPHY (TBP) SYSTEM THAT IS UNLIKE THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS IN THAT IT OBVIATES THE NEED FOR USING A DERMATOSCOPE AND CAN PRODUCE IMAGES OF SUFFICIENT RESOLUTION THAT CAN BE USED FOR EARLY DETECTION OF SKIN CANCERS. THIS DEVICE HAS ALREADY RECEIVED AN IRB AND HAS BEEN INSTALLED AT JOHNS HOPKINS (JHU) OUTPATIENT CENTER FOR ITS FIRST CLINICAL STUDY. BY YOUR READING OF THIS PROPOSAL IS UNDER REVIEW, JHU\u2019S 100-PATIENT STUDY IN WHICH THE EFFICACY OF SCAN-BASED EXAMINATIONS WILL BE COMPARED WITH THE EFFICACY OF TRADITIONAL CLINICAL AND DERMATOSCOPIC-BASED SKIN EXAMINATIONS, IS WELL ON ITS WAY. WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL TEAM INTENDS TO DEVELOP A TEMPORAL STUDY TOOL THAT CAN FOLLOW ALL PSLS OVER TIME REGARDLESS OF PARTICIPANTS\u2019 POSE AND WEIGHT CHANGES BETWEEN SCANNING SESSIONS. SUCH A SYSTEM WILL ENABLE CLINICIANS TO ACCURATELY MONITOR PATIENTS\u2019 PSLS OVER TIME, DOCUMENT ANY CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED LESIONS, AND DETECT NEW LESIONS AT THE POINT OF CARE. WITHIN, THE TWO PHASES OF THIS PROJECT, THE TEAM WILL ALSO FOCUS ON DETECTING EVOLVED LESIONS AND OPTIMIZING THE SCANNING SOFTWARE TO PROVIDE A BETTER USER INTERFACE FOR FOLLOWING AND DIAGNOSING PIGMENTED SKIN LESIONS (PSL) WHILE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES FOR THE DERMATOLOGIST TO FULLY DOCUMENT THE PATIENTS LESIONS OF INTEREST. THOUGH SOME LITERATURE SUGGESTS THE EPIDEMY IN MELANOMA IS THE RESULT OF OVER-SCREENING AS EVIDENCED BY THE NUMBER OF DEATHS NOT INCREASING COMMENSURATELY, OTHERS SUGGEST THAT THE LOW DEATH-RATE IS THE RESULT OF BETTER SCREENING. REGARDLESS, THERE IS UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT THAT TOO MANY LESIONS ARE STUDIED BY PATHOLOGISTS. LUMO SCANNER WHEN COMBINED WITH THE FACILITIES DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT, WILL ENABLE TECHNICIANS PERFORM HIGHLY ACCURATE SCANS AND THUS ALLOW THE DERMATOLOGIST TO SPEND LESS DOCUMENTING THE HIGH-RISK PATIENTS. ALSO, THIS NOVEL DEVICE WILL ENABLE TELEDERMATOLOGY IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS A SCARCITY OF DERMATOLOGISTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPOSED DEVICE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DIAGNOSING AND ACCURATELY MONITORING THE EFFICACY OF THERAPIES FOR PSORIASIS, ATOPIC DERMATITIS, AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY SKIN CONDITIONS. PSORIASIS AND ATOPIC DERMATITIS ARE ALSO SERIOUS GLOBAL PROBLEMS. IN THE UNITED STATES, PSORIASIS AFFECTS ABOUT 8 MILLION PEOPLE WHILE ABOUT 31.6 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE SOME FORM OF ECZEMA, INCLUDING ATOPIC DERMATITIS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "571588f1-dded-3ac5-6de9-d7d3a509706c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R41EB032304_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140658383, "Award ID": "R41EB032284", "Award Amount": 256579.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-23", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "A BILIARY TRACT-SPECIFIC FLUORESCENCE IMAGE-GUIDED SURGERY - ABSTRACT THE PRIMARY LIVER CANCER INCLUDING INTRAHEPATIC BILE DUCT CANCER POSE SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL BURDEN OF ILLNESS WITH INCREASING INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY IN US AND AROUND THE WORLD. SURGERY REMAINS THE MOST EFFECTIVE FORM OF TREATMENT. HOWEVER, SURGICAL COMPLICATION RATES FOR MEDIUM TO HIGH COMPLEXITY HEPATECTOMIES PERSIST IN 30-40% RANGE EVEN IN HIGHLY SKILLED HANDS AND AT HIGH VOLUME CENTERS. THE CRITICAL CHALLENGES APPEAR TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO NAVIGATING LIVER PARENCHYMAL DISSECTION, WHERE SIZE OF RESECTION SURFACE, ASSOCIATED WITH BLOOD LOSS AND MISSED BILE LEAKS FROM THE LIVER PARENCHYMA, AND PROLONGED OPERATIVE TIME DURING DISSECTION POSE SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE.  IN THIS RESEARCH, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN UPGRADED LAPAROSCOPIC IMAGER FOR DEEPER BILIARY-SPECIFIC FLUORESCENT IMAGING USING A SHORT-WAVE INFRARED (SWIR) SENSOR AND HIGH-DEFINITION RGB COLOR VISION, AND TO TEST THE UTILITY OF OUR MULTIMODAL LAPAROSCOPIC IMAGING TECHNIQUE IN LIVER SURGERY THROUGHOUT PRECLINICAL SWINE STUDIES.

WE REFER TO OUR NEW IMAGING METHODOLOGY AS MECHANICAL FLUX MANIPULATION (MFM). MFM UTILIZES HIGH RESOLUTION PIXELATED DETECTORS, HIGH BANDWIDTH DATA ACQUISITION ELECTRONICS AND A NOVEL IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGY UTILIZING DETECTOR FLUX INFORMATION TO ACHIEVE TARGET PERFORMANCE GOALS OF >50% DETECTION EFFICIENCY FOR PHOTONS IMPINGING AN MFM DETECTOR AND <2 MM RECONSTRUCTED IMAGE RESOLUTION. MFM IS A SPR TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGING TECHNIQUE. THE TWO MAIN FEATURES THAT DIFFERENTIATE MFM FROM TRADITIONAL SPECT ARE COLLIMATOR-LESS DETECTORS AND THE USE OF FLUX-PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS VERSUS LINE OF RESPONSE (LOR) COUNTS TO RECONSTRUCT IMAGES. MFM REJECTS THE NOTION THAT THE DIRECTION OF EVERY DETECTED PHOTON MUST BE KNOWN IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY RECONSTRUCT IMAGES FROM A SINGLE PHOTON RADIONUCLIDE EMITTING OBJECT. INSTEAD, MFM COLLECTS FLUX INFORMATION ON A CRYSTAL BY CRYSTAL BASIS AND RECORDS HOW THE FLUX TO EACH CRYSTAL IS ALTERED BY MOVING A MECHANICAL ATTENUATOR (MA) BETWEEN THE EMISSION OBJECT AND THE DETECTOR. USING FLUX INFORMATION, THE INCIDENT DIRECTION OF EACH DETECTED PHOTON IS NOT REQUIRED FOR IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION. MFM IS FURTHER DIFFERENTIATED FROM SPECT IN THAT IT USES FULLY 3D IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION RATHER THAN STACKS OF 2D DATA. WHILE MFM WILL SUPPORT GENERAL SINGLE PHOTON TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGING PROTOCOLS, THE FOCUS OF THIS PHASE I PROPOSAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY FOR HUMAN BRAIN IMAGING. THIS PROJECT IS CONSISTS OF THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. THE FIRST AIM IS TO EXTEND AND VALIDATE THE SIMSET MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TOOL TO SIMULATE AN MFM SCANNER INCLUDING REAL-WORLD EFFECTS. THE MAIN COMPONENT OF THIS EXTENSION IS TO BE ABLE TO SIMULATE CONTINUOUS MA MOTION. AN ADDITIONAL SUB-AIM IS TO FABRICATE A PROTOTYPE MA ASSEMBLY AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL PIXELATED DETECTOR PANEL TO COLLECT EXPERIMENTAL DATA WITH WHICH TO VALIDATE THE SIMSET MONTE CARLO SOFTWARE TOOLS. THE SECOND AIM OF THE PROJECT IS TO EXPAND THE MFM IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION SOFTWARE TO 3D AND TO INCORPORATE ALL CORRECTIONS TO SUPPORT QUANTITATIVE IMAGING. EXTENDING TO FULLY 3D IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPUTING RESOURCES AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE ALGORITHMS SO THAT THE CODE CAN RUN EFFICIENTLY. ONE OF THE SUB-AIMS IS TO IMPLEMENT THE RECONSTRUCTION SOFTWARE USING GPU PROCESSORS. THE THIRD AIM IS TO USE THE VALIDATED MONTE CARLO TOOLS FROM SPECIFIC AIM 1 AND THE FULLY 3D IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION CODE DEVELOPED IN AIM 2 TO OPTIMIZE THE DESIGN OF A MFM IMAGING SYSTEM FOR HIGH RESOLUTION HUMAN BRAIN IMAGING.

ACCORDING TO THE CDC, RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE AT RISK FOR A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF EXCESS DEATHS FROM THE 5 LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH (CANCER, HEART DISEASE, CLRD, UNINTENTIONAL INJURY, AND STROKE). TECHNICAL ENGINEERING INNOVATIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS RURAL DISPARITIES. BUT TO DO SO, EXPLICIT EFFORTS MUST BE MADE TO EXPOSE FUTURE ENGINEERS TO THE HEALTHCARE CHALLENGES FACED BY RURAL AMERICA TODAY.  THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF FOCUS ON RURAL HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES IN ENGINEERING CLASSROOMS. WE BELIEVE THAT IMMERSING BIOENGINEERING STUDENT GROUPS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND HOSPITALS WILL PROMOTE THE IDENTIFICATION OF INNOVATIVE ENGINEERING DESIGN SOLUTIONS THAT CAN ADDRESS RURAL HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES, ENCOURAGE SOME STUDENTS TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITIES TO FIND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS, AND ESTABLISH A CURRICULUM THAT SUPPORTS CAREER PATHS THAT SEEK TO ADDRESS RURAL HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES. THE FIRST AIM OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO ENHANCE RURAL HEALTH CO-CREATION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS. WE WILL ESTABLISH A CLINICAL IMMERSION CO-CREATION PROGRAM FOR A SUBSET OF NU BIOENGINEERING STUDENTS IN MAINE RURAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. TEAMS OF STUDENTS WILL WORK WITH MAINE TRACK MEDICAL STUDENTS AND CLINICIANS OVER THE COURSE OF 6 WEEKS TO IDENTIFY DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES EMPHASIZING THE CONCEPT OF CO-CREATION.

INSTEAD OF USING A LOSSY STRETCHABLE CONDUCTOR, WE WILL USE FLEXIBLE, STRATEGICALLY DRAPED LITZ WIRE ON A STRETCHABLE CAP TO CONSTRUCT THE SINGLE CHANNEL RECEIVER COIL. THE INDUCTANCE OF THE COIL WILL CHANGE WITH EACH SUBJECT DUE TO THE CHANGE-ABLE DIAMETER AND SHAPE. THEREFORE, WE WILL IMPLEMENT AN EXTERNAL TUNING AND MATCHING BOX FOR \u201cAUTOTUNING\u201d THE COIL. THE AUTOTUNING SYSTEM WILL MAKE USE OF A COMPACT PC-CONTROLLED VECTOR NETWORK ANALYZER (VNA) TO MONITOR THE S-PARAMETERS OF THE COIL AND OUTPUT APPROPRIATE VOLTAGES TO VOLTAGE-CONTROLLED CAPACITORS (VARACTOR DIODES) FOR ADJUSTABLE TUNING/MATCHING.

THIS IS BECAUSE CURRENT HEMOSTATIC ASSAYS REQUIRE ELECTRICAL POWER, CAPITAL EXPENSE, SKILLED TECHNICIANS, LARGE EQUIPMENT, AND CAN BE SLOW. AS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE INCREASES IN LMICS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE TOOLS FOR THESE LOWER RESOURCE ENVIRONMENTS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE, MICROFLUIDIC-PAPER BASED ANALYTICAL DEVICES (PAD)S HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR LOW RESOURCE SETTINGS AS A POINT-OF-CARE TECHNOLOGY SINCE THESE ARE RAPID, COST-EFFECTIVE, PORTABLE, DISPOSABLE, EAS-TO-USE, AND TYPICALLY REQUIRE ELECTRICITY. SUCH DEVICES INCLUDE THE RAPID ANTIGEN TESTS DEVELOPED FOR COVID-19, WHICH PROVIDE CRITICAL RAPID FEEDBACK FOR MAKING EDUCATED HEALTH DECISIONS.

SEMINAL EXPERIMENTS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF NB IN IRRADIATED WATER, WHICH MANIFESTED AS A DECREASE IN THE ULTRASOUND POWER REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE ACOUSTIC CAVITATION. THESE RESULTS RAISE A CRUCIAL YET UNANSWERED QUESTION: DOES IONIZING RADIATION NUCLEATE NBS IN VIVO, INSIDE IRRADIATED TISSUES? RADIATION IS WIDELY USED IN MEDICINE. THE PREMISE THAT NBS MAY BE NUCLEATED IN PATIENTS DURING DIAGNOSTIC SCANS OR RADIATION THERAPY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE NBS COULD INDUCE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS. IN ADDITION, THEIR PRESENCE IN THE TISSUES MAY LOWER THE THRESHOLD FOR ACOUSTIC CAVITATION, WHICH SUGGEST A NOVEL MECHANISM FOR INCREASING THE EFFICACY OF RADIATION THERAPY.

AS SERINE IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF ONE CARBON UNITS, 13C-LABELED SERINES ARE IDEAL PROBES FOR THE MITOCHONDRIAL FOLATE CYCLE. AIM 1 WILL FOCUS ON THE SYNTHESIS AND IN VITRO CHARACTERIZATION OF DEUTERATED, 13C-LABELED SERINES AS HYPERPOLARIZED 13C PROBES FOR THE ONE CARBON METABOLISM. IN AIM 2, WE WILL TEST THE HYPERPOLARIZED PROBES IN HEPATOMA CELL CULTURES AND IN VIVO IN NORMAL AND ORTHOTOPIC XENOGRAFT RAT MODEL FOR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.

FLUORESCENCE GUIDED SURGERY (FGS) HAS SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO CLINICAL MEDICINE WITH ONLY TWO FDA-APPROVED NEAR-INFRARED (NIR, 650-900 NM) FLUOROPHORES. FGS SYSTEMS OPERATE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN THE NIR REGION, WHERE TISSUE CHROMO- PHORE ABSORBANCE, AUTOFLUORESCENCE AND SCATTER FALL TO LOCAL MINIMA, PERMITTING HIGH CONTRAST AND HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING AT DEPTHS UP TO A CENTIMETER.

THE KEY ELEMENT IN OUR SOLUTION IS A RING- SHAPED, STATIONARY SPECTRAL ENCODER THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE CT GANTRY OPENING.

OUR BASIC PREMISE IS THAT AN INTEGRATED ONE-STAGE, WHOLE-BRAIN DATA STRATEGY WILL IMPROVE ESTIMATION AND POWER EVEN IN STUDIES WITH SMALL SAMPLE SIZES.  THE PROPOSED METHODS WILL BE GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO FMRI DATA, BUT TO ILLUSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE METHODS, WE WILL REANALYZE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS FROM TWO AREAS OF IMPORTANCE TO MENTAL HEALTH. SUICIDE IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN, WITH THE CDC REPORTING IT TO BE THE CAUSE OF TWO-THIRDS OF ALL HOMICIDES IN 2017, YET IT REMAINS HIGHLY UNPREDICTABLE. RECENT WORK PROVIDED FMRI DATA ON 34 SUBJECTS UPON EXPOSING THEM TO 10 WORDS EACH WITH POSITIVE, NEGATIVE OR DEATH-RELATED CONNOTATIONS. ANALYSIS OF SUCH INVOLUNTARY DATA CAN REVEAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUICIDE ATTEMPTERS AND IDEATORS, PINPOINT SUBJECTS WITH ELEVATED SUICIDE RISK, OR IDENTIFY THE WORDS WITH HIGHEST DISCRIMINATORY POWER BETWEEN GROUPS, ALL USEFUL OUTCOMES FOR DIAGNOSING AND PREVENTING SUICIDE. MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) IS PROJECTED TO BE THE MOST PREVALENT CAUSE OF DISEASE WORLDWIDE BY 2030, YET ONLY HALF OF MDD PATIENTS RECEIVE TREATMENT. A RECENT STUDY PROVIDED FMRI DATA ON 39 SUBJECTS USING A VALIDATED EMOTIONAL MUSICAL AND NONMUSICAL AUDITORY PARADIGM. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO LEVERAGE MUSIC AS A DIAGNOSTIC OR THERAPY FOR MDD. WE WILL USE OUR METHODS TO RE-EVALUATE SEX, AGE, AND OTHER MEASURED COVARIATES, SUCH AS SUBJECT RATINGS OF THE MUSIC, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY ONLY ANALYZED DESCRIPTIVELY, TO BETTER DETECT DIFFERENCES IN CEREBRAL ACTIVATION BETWEEN MDD AND CONTROLS, INCLUDING ONE MDD SUBJECT WITH MISSING DATA DUE TO EXCESS MOTION IN THE MACHINE.  OUR APPROACH WILL DIRECTLY MODEL THE COMPLEX, HIGH-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF FMRI DATA, INCLUDING THREE SPATIAL DIMENSIONS, TIME, AND SUBJECT, BY EXTENDING MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION TO A MORE NATURAL AND CORRECT TENSOR-ON-TENSOR LINEAR REGRESSION FRAMEWORK, PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED TO BE COMPUTATIONALLY INTRACTABLE.

ION-SELECTIVE ELECTRODES HAVE BEEN ROUTINELY USED FOR ELECTROLYTE MEASUREMENTS IN CLINICAL CHEMISTRY ANALYZERS AND BLOOD ANALYZERS IN HOSPITALS SINCE THE 1980S. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WITH CONDITIONS SUCH AS HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, HEART FAILURE, BIPOLAR DISORDER, AND END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE OFTEN NEED TO MONITOR THEIR ELECTROLYTES MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY THAN ALLOWED BY HOSPITAL VISITS.

THE PAST DECADE HAS WITNESSED A SURGE OF INTEREST IN ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE ELECTROLYTE MONITORING BASED ON HOME-USE SENSORS, WEARABLE SENSORS, TRANSDERMAL SENSORS, AND IMPLANTABLE SENSORS. HOWEVER, ION-SELECTIVE ELECTRODES ARE ONLY ACCURATE WHEN CALIBRATED WITH A STANDARD SOLUTION AT THE POINT OF USE. ALL CENTRALIZED, BENCHTOP, AND HANDHELD INSTRUMENTS WITH ION-SELECTIVE ELECTRODES USE PUMPS OR ACTUATORS TO HANDLE CALIBRATION SOLUTIONS AND SAMPLES VIA COMPLICATED FLUIDIC SYSTEMS.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A COMPLETELY NEW CALIBRATION STRATEGY FOR ION-SELECTIVE ELECTRODES WITHOUT USING ANY MOVING PARTS OR FLUIDICS. A NARROW CALIBRATION PHASE IS BUILT IN BETWEEN THE WORKING AND REFERENCE ELECTRODES TO PROVIDE A BASELINE POTENTIAL THAT SERVES AS A ONE-POINT CALIBRATION. SURPRISINGLY, THE CALIBRATION BRIDGE DOES NOT NEED TO BE REMOVED FOR THE SAMPLE TESTING BECAUSE THE SAMPLE DOMINATES THE INTERFACIAL CHARGE TRANSFER AND THE POTENTIOMETRIC SIGNAL.

TO THIS END, THE SURGEON MAXIMIZES THE EXTENT OF TUMOR RESECTION (EOR) WHILE PRESERVING FUNCTION. PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY OF WHITE MATTER TRACTS (WMT) DURING BRAIN TUMOR SURGERY IS A NECESSARY REQUIREMENT TO PRESERVE FUNCTION. HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAR BOUNDARY BETWEEN FUNCTIONING WMTS AND TUMOR TISSUE POSES A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR THE NEUROSURGEON. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) TRACTOGRAPHY PROVIDES THE SURGEON WITH PREOPERATIVE IMAGES OF WMTS TO HELP PREDICT THEIR LOCATION. INTRAOPERATIVELY, THE SURGEON CAN USE TRACTOGRAPHY IMAGES WITH IMAGE-GUIDANCE TO MAXIMIZE PRESERVATION OF WMT INTEGRITY, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ENABLE FASTER AND SAFER SURGERIES, IMPROVED FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES, AND INCREASED EOR. HOWEVER, MRI TRACTOGRAPHY HAS PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS AS A SURGICAL AID FOR PRESERVING WMT INTEGRITY. FIRST, WMT RECONSTRUCTION CAN BE INACCURATE AND IMPRECISE DUE TO ALGORITHM VARIABILITY, USER DETERMINED THRESHOLDS, VARIABLE TRACTOGRAPHER EXPERTISE, AND QUALITY OF MRI DATA, WHICH LEADS TO FALSE POSITIVES AND FALSE NEGATIVES. IN BRAIN TUMORS, THIS CHALLENGE IS EXACERBATED BY UNPREDICTABLE PATTERNS OF WMT DISPLACEMENT, BRAIN EDEMA, AND SIGNAL ALTERATION DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING TUMOR. EVEN WITH OPTIMAL WMT RECONSTRUCTION, INTRAOPERATIVE MRI TRACTOGRAPHY DOES NOT PROVIDE AN ACCURATE LOCATION OF WMTS BECAUSE IT IS NOT A REAL-TIME VIEW OF THE DYNAMIC CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN THE SURGICAL FIELD.

LIVER IRON CONCENTRATION IS WIDELY ACCEPTED FOR THE BEST INDICATOR OF TOTAL BODY IRON STORES; THEREFORE, ACCURATE LIVER IRON QUANTIFICATION IMPROVES CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF IRON OVERLOAD AND MINIMIZES SIDE EFFECTS OF CHELATOR ADMINISTRATION. MRI-BASED R2* RELAXOMETRY (R2*-MRI) IS A NONINVASIVE CLINICAL STANDARD FOR LIVER IRON QUANTIFICATION WITH NO IONIZING RADIATION DUE TO ITS SENSITIVITY TO THE PRESENCE OF TISSUE IRON. R2*-MRI ACQUIRES IMAGES AT MULTIPLE TIME POINTS TO ESTIMATE R2* (= 1/T2*) RELAXATION RATES AT EACH VOXEL. HOWEVER, CLINICALLY AVAILABLE R2*-MRI IS PRONE TO PATIENT MOVEMENT SUCH AS RESPIRATORY MOTION THAT BREATH-HOLDING IS COMMONLY PRACTICED DURING SCAN. BREATH-HOLDING IS CHALLENGING FOR CHILDREN AND SOME ADULTS, AND UNSATISFACTORY BREATH- HOLDING LEADS TO POOR R2* VALUES. THE OTHER CHALLENGE WITH THE CURRENT R2*-MRI IS CAUSED BY SIGNAL LOSS DUE TO RAPID T2* DECAY IN THE PRESENCE OF A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF IRON. SEVERE IRON LOADING IS COMMONLY SEEN IN PATIENTS WITH TRANSFUSION-INDUCED IRON OVERLOAD, AND THE CURRENT R2*-MRI DOES NOT RELIABLY CAPTURE SUCH A RAPID SIGNAL DECAY, RESULTING IN INACCURACY IN R2* MEASUREMENTS.

THE AMINO ACID SELENOCYSTEINE (SEC), SOMETIMES KNOWN AS THE 21ST AMINO ACID, IS INCORPORATED INTO HUMAN PROTEINS VIA RECODING OF OPAL (UGA) STOP CODONS.

MOREOVER, A FEW NEW STUDIES INDICATED THAT MULTIPLE DELIVERIES OF EVS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES, WHICH ARE HARD TO ACCOMPLISH USING THE CURRENT CLINICAL ADMINISTRATION ROUTES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THERANOSTIC, INJECTABLE MICROSPHEROID EV-DELIVERY SYSTEMS (EVDS) FOR LOCAL, TARGETED, AND SUSTAINED-DELIVERY OF EVS WHILE ENABLING EV TRACKING IN VIVO WITH MAGNETIC PARTICLE IMAGING (MPI).

REPEATED SURGERY IS OFTEN NOT RECOMMENDED SINCE PATIENTS HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH IT DURING THE TREATMENT OF INITIAL GBM, AND THE EFFICACY OF OTHER TREATMENT OPTIONS IS VERY LIMITED. LASER INTERSTITIAL THERMOTHERAPY (LITT) IS AN EMERGING TECHNIQUE FOR MINIMALLY INVASIVE TREATMENT OF RGBM. BY INTRODUCING A SLENDER LASER PROBE INTO A BRAIN TUMOR, LITT CAN ABLATE THE TUMOR TISSUE PERCUTANEOUSLY USING LASER RADIATION.

THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY TYPES OF STROKE: ISCHEMIC AND HEMORRHAGIC. ISCHEMIC STROKE INVOLVES BLOOD OR FATTY PLAQUE BLOCKING A VESSEL OF THE BRAIN WHILE HEMORRHAGIC IS DEFINED BY A VESSEL RUPTURE OR BRAIN BLEED. EACH TYPE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT TREATMENTS, AND TREATMENT OF THE WRONG TYPE COULD HAVE LETHAL CONSEQUENCES. THIS MAKES STROKE TYPE IDENTIFICATION CRUCIAL TO RECEIVING TREATMENT. THUS, NEUROLOGIC MONITORING AND TIMELY INTERVENTION ARE KEY FOR ACUTE STROKE RECOVERY, YET CURRENTLY NO BEDSIDE MONITOR CAPABLE OF DETECTING A RECURRENT STROKE, HEMORRHAGIC TRANSFORMATION AND/OR EVOLVING STROKE AT ONSET EXISTS. TODAY\u2019S STANDARD-OF-CARE RELIES ON MONITORING GENERAL PATIENT VITALS AND PERIODIC CT/MRI SCANS TO IMAGE THE INTRACRANIAL STATE; UNFORTUNATELY, THE LARGE TIME PERIODS BETWEEN SCANS DELAYS POSSIBLE DETECTION OF A HIGH-CONSEQUENCE CHANGE IN CONDITION. WITH EVERY MINUTE OF PRE-INTERVENTION TIME EQUATING TO AN INCREASE IN LASTING DISABILITY ODDS, A REAL-TIME MONITOR COULD NOT ONLY SAVE LIVES, BUT SAVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A SMALL FORM-FACTOR, ON- SCENE DEVICE CAPABLE OF MAPPING THE INTRACRANIAL SPACE AND DIFFERENTIATING ISCHEMIC FROM HEMORRHAGIC STROKE.  DURING THIS PROGRAM WE WILL TAKE THE SIGNIFICANT STEP OF DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY WITH TRANSLATION IN MIND AND DEMONSTRATING PROOF OF FEASIBILITY IN A PRE-CLINICAL HUMAN STUDY OF HIGH-RISK PATIENTS UNDERGOING MONITORING AFTER BEING ADMITTED FOR STROKE. WE WILL DEVELOP A NON-INVASIVE SENSING APPROACH TO INTRACRANIAL MONITORING (AIM I), A KEY INNOVATION FOR STROKE USE, AND VALIDATE THIS SENSING ABILITY IN A COHORT OF PATIENTS BEING MONITORED FOLLOWING STROKE (AIM II). BY ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF OUR NOVEL APPROACH TO NON-INVASIVE INTRACRANIAL MONITORING IN A TIGHTLY CONTROLLED PATIENT COHORT (POST-STROKE MONITORING), WE CAN VALIDATE OUR ABILITY TO 1) DETECT THE PRESENCE OF STROKE AND 2) DIFFERENTIATE STROKE TYPE. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO NOT ONLY AID IN THE CLINIC AS A MONITOR FOR DETECTING STROKE ONSET WITHIN PATIENTS AT HIGH-RISK FOR RECURRENT STROKE OR WORSENING STATUS, BUT ALSO IN THE FIELD FOR MOBILE STROKE TYPE DISCRIMINATION. BECAUSE THIS SYSTEM HAS A SMALL FORM-FACTOR, IS NON-INVASIVE, IS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE (<$10K FOR AN INTRACRANIAL BIOIMPEDANCE MONITORING SYSTEM), AND IS POTENTIALLY ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE STROKE TYPE AT FIRST CONTACT WITH THE PATIENT, THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL OF BEING EASILY TRANSLATED TO AND ACCEPTED BY THE CLINIC FOR THE BENEFIT OF DIAGNOSING OR TRACKING PATIENTS EXPERIENCING A STROKE.

AMONG ALL FUNCTIONAL IMAGING MODALITIES, MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY (MEG) HAS THE BEST COMBINED SPATIOTEMPORAL RESOLUTION, WHICH MAKES IT AN EXCELLENT TOOL FOR NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROLOGY. TO EXPLOIT THE POTENTIALLY GOOD SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF MEG, ONE MUST SOLVE THE INVERSE PROBLEM, I.E., ESTIMATE THE UNDERLYING NEURAL CURRENTS FROM THE SPATIALLY DISCRETIZED MEASUREMENT OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD. THIS TASK, WHICH IS NON-UNIQUE IN PRINCIPLE, IS ACCOMPLISHED BY FITTING SPECIFIC PARAMETRIZED MATHEMATICAL MODELS TO THE ACQUIRED MULTI-CHANNEL DATA AND DETERMINING A SET OF PARAMETERS THAT PROVIDES THE BEST FIT ACCORDING TO A PARTICULAR OPTIMIZATION CRITERION. CONSEQUENTLY, THESE PARAMETERS TRANSLATE TO AN ESTIMATE OF THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF THE NEURAL CURRENT, WHICH IS USED IN THE INTERPRETATION OF BRAIN FUNCTION UNDER VARIOUS TASKS AND CONDITIONS. THE SPATIAL PRECISION OF MEG CAN BE DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: WHAT IS THE MINIMUM DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO NEARBY SPATIAL CONCENTRATIONS OF NEURAL CURRENT THAT CAN BE DISTINGUISHED AS TWO SEPARATE SOURCES INSTEAD OF ONE, PERHAPS EXTENDED, SOURCE? IN PRINCIPLE, THIS TASK APPEARS INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT AS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SOURCES AND THE MEASUREMENT SENSORS INCREASES. THE REASON FOR THE DIFFICULTY IS TWO-FOLD: 1) THE AMPLITUDE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD DECREASES WITH DISTANCE AND 2) THE SPATIALLY COMPLEX FEATURES OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD DECAY WITH DISTANCE FASTER THAN THE SPATIALLY SMOOTHER, LESS INFORMATIVE, FEATURES. IN CONVENTIONAL INVERSE MODELING, THE SECOND TYPE OF DIFFICULTY MAY CAUSE DISTINCT SOURCES TO BECOME MERGED AS ONE ESTIMATED SOURCE EVEN IN THE HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION THAT THE SENSORS HAVE NO NOISE AT ALL.

A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF THE COINCIDENCE TIME RESOLUTION (CTR) AND ENERGY RESOLUTION WOULD BOOST THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO AND HENCE ENHANCE IMAGE QUALITY, RESULTING IN MORE ACCURATE DIAGNOSES, LOWER PATIENT DOSES AND EXPOSURE TIMES, AND GRANTING ACCESS TO A NEW BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS FOR TOF-PET. THE ULTRA-FAST PICOSECOND EMISSION OF CHERENKOV LIGHT HAS DEMONSTRATED TO ACHIEVE THE BEST CTR EVER REACHED OF 30PS FWHM USING PBF2, A PURE CHERENKOV EMITTER. HOWEVER, THIS PROVIDES A VERY POOR ENERGY RESOLUTION DUE TO THE LOW LIGHT YIELD OF CHERENKOV EMISSION. THE COMBINATION OF CHERENKOV AND SCINTILLATION EMISSION HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A WAY TO OBTAIN BOTH GOOD TIME AND ENERGY RESOLUTION, WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN BISMUTH GERMANIUM OXIDE (BGO), A HIGH STOPPING POWER SCINTILLATOR FOR PET, TO OBTAIN A CTR OF 120PS FWHM WITH AN ENERGY RESOLUTION OF 14%. THE MAIN REASON WHY IT IS VERY CHALLENGING FOR BGO TO REACH CTRS OF 30PS FHWM IS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE SLOWER SCINTILLATION LIGHT AND THE INABILITY OF CURRENT DETECTORS TO DISENTANGLE BETWEEN CHERENKOV AND SCINTILLATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHERENKOV AND SCINTILLATION LIGHT EMISSION SPECTRA, MAKES IT VERY HARD TO OBTAIN A BGO DETECTOR THAT PROVIDES BOTH GOOD TIME AND ENERGY RESOLUTION.

WHILE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE INCREASING STABILITY AND INNATE ACTIVATION OF POTENTIAL ORALLY DELIVERED MUCOSAL DRUGS, SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS EXIST AT THE INTERCELLULAR AND INTRACELLULAR LEVELS, WHICH LEAVES POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPECIFIC AND NON-SPECIFIC FACTORS DETERMINING RECOGNITION AND TRANSPORT OF DRUG CANDIDATES ACROSS THE INTESTINAL EPITHELIA. FURTHERMORE, UNDERSTANDING HOW NANOPARTICLES-BASED ORAL DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS TRANSPORT THROUGH INTESTINAL EPITHELIUM AND HOW THE TRANSPORT BEHAVIOR CAN BE MANIPULATED THROUGH SURFACE MODIFICATION TO CREATE GUIDED TRANSPORT PATHWAYS THROUGH INTESTINAL EPITHELIUM WILL PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL AND ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE ON FUTURE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION. THUS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO FILL THESE GAPS IN LEARNING BECAUSE THE INTERCELLULAR AND ORGAN LEVEL INTERACTIONS AND RESULTANT BIOLOGICAL INFLUENCES ARE CRITICAL FOR PRECISE CONTROL OF NANOPARTICLES-BASED ORAL DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS TARGETING INTESTINAL MUCOSA AND MUCOSAL-ASSOCIATED LYMPHOID TISSUE (MALT).

FINALLY, FOR TUNING AND ADJUSTING THE COILS THEMSELVES, VARACTOR DIODES PROVIDE A VOLTAGE VARIABLE CAPACITANCE THAT CAN BE USED TO MANIPULATE LOW-POWER RF SIGNALS. THE CASE IS QUITE DIFFERENT WITH TRANSMIT ARRAYS. VARACTOR DIODES GENERALLY DO NOT WORK DUE TO THE HIGH VOLTAGES REQUIRED IN THE RF TRANSMIT CHAIN. THUS, PHASE SHIFTING ELEMENTS ARE OFTEN SIMPLY TRANSMISSION LINES, POSSIBLY SWITCHED WITH PIN DIODE SWITCHES. TUNING IS FIXED OR ADJUSTED MANUALLY OR WITH SWITCHES. SWITCHED ELEMENTS CAN BE BULKY AND RESULT IN DISCRETIZATION THAT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR SOME B1 SHIMMING APPLICATIONS OR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS TRANSMIT SENSE. THIS IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN THE TRANSMIT CHAIN BECAUSE ALL SIGNAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE DONE ONE TIME, PRIOR TO EACH TRANSMISSION- NOT DURING RECONSTRUCTION. THIS HAS LIMITED TRANSMIT ARRAY DESIGN TO A MUCH SMALLER GROUP OF SITES, PRIMARILY THOSE WITH MULTIPLE CHANNEL TRANSMITTERS, WHICH CAN BE QUITE COSTLY.

NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS (NASH), AS AN ADVANCED FORM OF NAFLD, INVOLVES STEATOSIS, INFLAMMATION AND CONCOMITANT IRON DEPOSITION IN THE LIVER. DUE TO CHRONIC CELLULAR INJURY, NASH CAN ALSO CAUSE LIVER FIBROSIS, WHICH IS A COMMON TRIGGER OF MORE SEVERE LIVER COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS CIRRHOSIS, PORTAL HYPERTENSION, OR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC). AS A RESULT, SIMULTANEOUS MEASURES OF THESE CLINICAL INDICATORS ARE CRUCIAL TO PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE AND COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF NASH. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) IS A WELL- ACCEPTED MODALITY FOR EVALUATING NASH DUE TO ITS EXCELLENT SOFT-TISSUE CONTRAST RESOLUTION AND ABUNDANT CONTRAST MECHANISMS WITHOUT RADIATION EXPOSURE, ALLOWING FOR MULTIPARAMETRIC ASSESSMENT OF THE LIVER. SEVERAL MRI- RELATED BIOMARKERS, SUCH AS PROTON DENSITY FAT FRACTION (PDFF), T2*/R2*, AND ELASTOGRAPHY-DERIVED STIFFNESS, HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND ESTABLISHED FOR QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF LIVER FAT, IRON, AND FIBROSIS, RESPECTIVELY, BUT NONE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR EVALUATING INFLAMMATION, THE MOST IMPORTANT CLINICAL HALLMARK THROUGHOUT THE DISEASE COURSE OF NASH. T1 IS AN MRI PARAMETER THAT CAN POTENTIALLY BE A USEFUL MARKER FOR NASH, AND THERE HAS LONG BEEN AN INTEREST IN USING T1 CHANGES TO CHARACTERIZE LIVER INFLAMMATION AND/OR FIBROSIS. HOWEVER, EXISTING STANDARD T1 MAPPING METHODS SUFFER FROM SEVERAL LIMITATIONS WHEN APPLIED TO NASH PATIENTS. FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANT, STANDARD T1 MAPPING ONLY MEASURES COMPOSITE T1 (WATER-FAT-IRON-MIXED T1) OF THE LIVER, WHICH CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL BIAS DUE TO THE INCREASED FAT AND IRON CONTENT IN THE LIVER OF NASH PATIENTS. THIS IS BECAUSE BOTH FAT AND IRON HAVE SHORT T1, WHILE CONVERSELY, INFLAMMATION/FIBROSIS TENDS TO PROLONG T1. SECOND, T1 MAPPING OF THE LIVER, PARTICULARLY WITH 3D WHOLE-LIVER COVERAGE, REMAINS CHALLENGING DUE TO RESPIRATORY MOTION AND THE SLOW IMAGING SPEED OF MRI, WHICH CAN REDUCE MEASUREMENT ACCURACY AND REPRODUCIBILITY. THESE PROBLEMS REPRESENT MAJOR BARRIERS FOR EVALUATING FATTY LIVER DISEASES AND ASSOCIATED DISEASE HETEROGENEITY USING T1 MAPPING. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO PROPOSE AND TEST A NOVEL 3D LIVER T1 MAPPING METHOD THAT COULD ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. THE NEW METHOD, CALLED MAGNETIZATION-PREPARED DIXON GOLDEN-ANGLE RADIAL SPARSE PARALLEL (MP-DIXON-GRASP) MRI, FEATURES ADAPTIVE INVERSION RECOVERY-PREPARED MULTI-ECHO STACK-OF-STARS ACQUISITION IN COMBINATION WITH ADVANCED MODEL-BASED IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION, WHICH WILL ENABLE FREE-BREATHING FAT/IRON- CORRECTED T1 MAPPING TO ESTIMATE THE \u201cTRUE T1\u201d OF UNDERLYING LIVER PARENCHYMA. OUR MAIN HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED IN THIS R21 PROPOSAL IS THAT BY REMOVING THE INFLUENCE OF FAT AND IRON, MORE ACCURATE T1 CAN BE ESTIMATED AS A BETTER MARKER OF LIVER INFLAMMATION/FIBROSIS.

THE KEY INNOVATIVE ELEMENT OF THE APPROACH IS THE USE OF WIREFRAME-LIKE NUCLEIC ACID NANOPARTICLES (NANPS) TO BIND PROTEIN TARGETS WITH HIGH AFFINITY EITHER DIRECTLY OR BY MEANS OF AUXILIARY ANTIBODY PROTEINS. BINDING OF THE PROTEIN TARGETS IS DETECTED BY FIRST INCUBATING THE SAMPLE WITH A COCKTAIL OF NANPS AND THEN EXAMINING THEM USING A NANOPORE IN A SOLID-STATE MEMBRANE. PROTEIN DETECTION RELIES ON MEASUREMENT OF THE IONIC CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH THE NANOPORE: THE IONIC CURRENT AND PARTICLE DWELL TIME DECREASES BY A CHARACTERISTIC AMOUNT WHEN A NANP OF A CERTAIN TYPE ENTERS THE NANOPORE. IMPORTANTLY, BY MATCHING THE PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS OF THE NANP TO THE PHYSICAL DIMENSION OF THE NANOPORE, WE EXPECT TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE RESIDENCE TYPE OF THE NUCLEIC ACID NANOPARTICLES WITHIN THE NANOPORE AND THEREBY ACHIEVE ULTRA-SENSITIVE (SUB-PICOMOLAR RANGE) DETECTION OF THE PROTEIN-BOUND BIOMARKERS.

ULTRASOUND HAS THE INTRINSIC ADVANTAGES OF BEING REAL-TIME, PORTABLE, WIDELY AVAILABLE, NONINVASIVE, AND FREE FROM IONIZING RADIATION. THUS, TRANSCRANIAL ULTRASOUND IMAGING COULD POTENTIALLY PLAY A UNIQUE ROLE IN A TIME-SENSITIVE AND DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT WHERE X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) ARE UNAVAILABLE. FOR INSTANCE, TRANSCRANIAL ULTRASOUND HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIALS IN THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY DURING THE TRANSPORTATION OF PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITAL, AND IN BEDSIDE MONITORING OF BRAIN PHYSIOLOGY FOR STROKE PATIENTS IN AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. DESPITE ITS PROMISING POTENTIALS, THE USE OF TRANSCRANIAL ULTRASOUND IMAGING HAS BEEN LIMITED, LARGELY BECAUSE ADULT HUMAN SKULLS CAUSE SEVERE PHASE ABERRATION, LEADING TO HIGHLY DEGRADED ULTRASOUND IMAGES. PHASE ABERRATION FROM THE SKULL CAN BE ACCURATELY CORRECTED IF THE SPEED OF SOUND (SOS) AND PROFILE (I.E., THICKNESS DISTRIBUTION) OF THE SKULL ARE KNOWN A PRIORI. THE SKULL PROFILE AND SOS CAN BE ESTIMATED BY CT, CURRENTLY THE GOLD STANDARD APPROACH FOR TREATMENT PLANNING.

SPECIFICALLY, THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS CAN ONLY IDENTIFY ACTIVE COVID-19 INFECTED PATIENTS; THE ANTIBODY TESTS CAN ONLY INDICATE PRIOR COVID-19 INFECTIONS BUT NOT ACTIVE CASES. THESE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (QRT-PCR) AND RAPID ANTIGEN TESTS. IN PARTICULAR, THE QRT-PCR IS CURRENTLY THE MOST SENSITIVE METHOD (DOWN TO ~100 COPIES/ML) BUT CAN TAKE >12 HOURS TO PERFORM AND REQUIRE TRAINED PERSONNEL, SPECIFIC REAGENTS, AND EXPENSIVE MACHINES. THE RAPID ANTIGEN TESTS PROVIDE RESULTS WITHIN 30 MINUTES, BUT THESE TESTS REQUIRE THE SAMPLES TO CONTAIN HIGH VIRUS CONCENTRATION (I.E., >107 VIRUS PARTICLES/ML) LEADING TO INCREASING CHANCES OF FALSE-NEGATIVE CASES. IN ADDITION, ONE COMMON EXAMPLE OF THE ANTIBODY TESTS IS THE ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA). THIS TEST ONLY APPLIES TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED THE ANTIBODIES, WHICH COULD TAKE SEVERAL DAYS TO WEEKS. THUS FAR, NO SINGLE TESTS CAN DETECT BOTH ACTIVE AND PREVIOUSLY COVID-19 INFECTED CASES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT RAPID AND ULTRASENSITIVE VIRUS-DETECTION PLATFORM TERMED VIRAL-ID, WHICH IS CAPABLE OF SIMULTANEOUS DETECTING THE SARS-COV-2 RNA AND ANTIBODIES INSIDE SALIVA FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF BOTH ACTIVE AND PREVIOUS COVID-19 INFECTIONS WITHIN A SINGLE TEST. SPECIFICALLY, THE VIRAL-ID PLATFORM WILL ALLOW FOR SPECIFIC MOLECULAR TARGETING, SEPARATION, ENRICHMENT, AND FILTERING, ALL CARRIED OUT WITHIN A SINGLE SALIVA DROPLET UTILIZING THE NATURE-INSPIRED COFFEE RING EFFECT. TARGETING AND DETECTION OF THE VIRAL BIOMARKERS WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY APTAMER-FUNCTIONALIZED NANOPARTICLES AND DEEP-LEARNING-ENABLED SURFACE- ENHANCED RAMAN SCATTERING (SERS), RESPECTIVELY. USING SYNTHETIC SARS-COV-2 RNA AND ANTIBODY-SPIKED SALIVA AS A MODEL SYSTEM, THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE A BIO-ANALYSIS PLATFORM CAPABLE OF RAPID SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ULTRASENSITIVE DETECTION OF BOTH VIRAL RNA (~10 \u2013 100 COPIES/ML) AND ANTIBODIES (~FEMTOMOLAR) IN A SALIVA DROPLET WITHIN 30 MINUTES.

HERE WE PROPOSE A NEW PARADIGM IN IMAGING REPORTERS BASED ON CRISPR-CAS, WELL SUITED FOR IN VIVO IMAGING OF CELL AND GENE THERAPIES. RATHER THAN INTRODUCE EXOGENOUS IMAGING REPORTER GENES INTO THE GENOME OR CELL, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT CELL AND GENE THERAPIES CAN BE IMAGED IN VIVO BY USING CRISPR-MEDIATED TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION (CRISPRA) TECHNOLOGY TO INDUCE EXPRESSION OF NATIVE PROTEINS THAT FUNCTION AS IMAGING REPORTERS.

SARS-COV-2 BINDS TO ACE2 IN THE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACTS OF INFECTED PATIENTS TO GAIN ENTRY INTO LUNG CELLS, LEADING TO VIRAL PNEUMONIA AND POTENTIALLY FATAL RESPIRATORY FAILURE. MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PATIENTS WITH COMORBID CONDITIONS INCLUDING RESPIRATORY DISEASE, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, KIDNEY DISEASE, DIABETES, AND HYPERTENSION HAVE MUCH HIGHER MORTALITY RATES. ACE INHIBITORS AND ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS (ARB) ARE FREQUENTLY USED TO TREAT THESE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THE QUESTION REMAINS WHETHER SUCH TREATMENT MAY AFFECT THE OUTCOME IN COVID-19 PATIENTS DUE TO THE INHIBITORS' EFFECTS ON ACE2 EXPRESSION.

THE ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE, IN TURN, HAS ALLOWED ONE TO FORMULATE SPECIFIC MECHANISTIC QUESTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WHY WOULD A PARTICULAR MUTATION IN A VIRUS MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE IN INFECTING A LIVE CELL? IS IT BECAUSE THE MUTATION MAKES THE VIRUS STAY ON THE CELL SURFACE LONGER (ON TIME) BUT EXHIBITING THE SAME CELL-INTERNALIZATION PROPENSITY, OR IS IT BECAUSE THE MUTATION MAKES IT EASIER FOR THE VIRUS TO INVADE THE CELL WHILE THE OFF TIME REMAINS THE SAME? WHERE INSIDE A CELL AND WHEN DOES A VIRAL PARTICLE ESCAPE AN ENDOSOMAL ENCLOSURE AND/OR SHED ITS CAPSID TO RELEASE ITS GENETIC MATERIAL? BY ANALOGY, SIMILAR QUESTIONS CAN BE FORMULATED IN DESIGNING NANOPARTICLE-BASED DRUG DELIVERY VESSELS. MANY INGENIOUS EXPERIMENTS USING A DIVERSE ARRAY OF BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TOOLS HAVE BEEN DEVISED TO ADDRESS THEM, AND THE INSIGHTS HAVE LED TO TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH THAT HAS DIRECT THERAPEUTIC IMPACTS.

THE FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT GENE-BASED ASSAYS STEM FROM THEIR RELIANCE UPON AMPLIFICATION AND DETECTION OF SPECIFIC NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCES WITHIN THE VIRAL GENOME.

CO-OCCURRENCE OF HEPATIC IRON OVERLOAD AND STEATOSIS IS A COMMON MANIFESTATION OF DIFFUSE LIVER DISEASES, CHRONIC HEPATOPATHIES, AND CANCER THERAPY AND CAN CAUSE IRON- AND LIPO-TOXICITY LEADING TO PROGRESSIVE FIBROSIS, IRREVERSIBLE CIRRHOSIS, AND ULTIMATELY, ORGAN FAILURE. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) IS A CLINICALLY IMPORTANT NON-INVASIVE TOOL FOR ASSESSING HEPATIC IRON OVERLOAD AND STEATOSIS INDEPENDENTLY. HOWEVER, IN CO-EXISTING CONDITIONS, MRI QUANTIFICATION IS OFTEN INACCURATE DUE TO CONFOUNDING EFFECTS OF IRON AND FAT ON MRI SIGNAL. MULTI-SPECTRAL SIGNAL MODELS ACCOUNTING FOR THESE CONFOUNDING EFFECTS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR SIMULTANEOUS QUANTIFICATION OF TRANSVERSE RELAXATION RATE (R2*), A PREDICTOR FOR IRON CONTENT, AND FAT FRACTION (FF).

TO INHIBIT TONIC URETHRAL SPHINCTER TONE, WE WILL USE A SIMILAR APPROACH TO TARGET THE SOMATIC MOTOR NEURONS INNERVATING THE EXTERNAL URETHRAL SPHINCTER WITH INHIBITORY OPSINS (AIM 2). INHIBITION OF THESE NEURONS LEADS TO SPHINCTER RELAXATION. WE WILL TEST THE SPECIFICITY OF EXPRESSION, POTENTIAL OFF TARGET EFFECTS, AS WELL AS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF OPSIN ACTIVATION IN NA\u00cfVE AND IN A RAT MODEL OF SPINAL CORD INJURY. FINALLY, WE WILL DEVELOP A CONTROL PARADIGM TO COORDINATE ACTIVATION OF DETRUSOR WITH URETHRAL SPHINCTER RELAXATION, TO INITIATE COORDINATED AND COMPLETE EMPTYING OF THE BLADDER (AIM 3).

THESE METHODS MAY FIND CLINICAL APPLICATION IN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) DISEASES INVOLVING THE SPINAL CORD.  STUDYING SPINAL CORD FUNCTION USING FMRI HAS GAINED TRACTION IN THE PAST DECADE. AS OF TODAY, WE KNOW FROM FMRI FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY (FC) STUDIES THAT THE LEFT AND RIGHT DORSAL HORNS ARE CONNECTED (SO ARE LEFT/RIGHT VENTRAL HORNS) WITHIN THE SAME VERTEBRAL LEVEL, BUT NO CONNECTION EXISTS BETWEEN DORSAL-VENTRAL HORNS OR BETWEEN LEVELS. WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS THE CASE, AND THIS PUZZLE HAS INTRIGUED SPINAL CORD RESEARCHERS. FC ONLY MEASURES CO-ACTIVATION BETWEEN SPINAL REGIONS, AND WE ARGUE THAT THIS TRADITIONAL APPROACH HAS NOT PROVIDED US WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF SPINAL CORD\u2019S FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE. WE PROPOSE TO SOLVE THIS CONUNDRUM BY MEASURING DIRECTIONAL EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY (EC) AMONG SPINAL REGIONS INSTEAD OF CO-ACTIVATION (FC). THIS CHOICE IS SUPPORTED BY THE UNDERLYING ANATOMY. THE VENTRAL HORNS CARRY EFFERENT MOTOR SIGNALS FROM MOTOR CORTEX DOWN TO HIGHER VERTEBRAL LEVELS AND THEN TO LOWER ONES, WHILE DORSAL HORNS CARRY AFFERENT SOMATOSENSORY SIGNALS UP FROM LOWER TO HIGHER LEVELS AND THEN TO THE POSTCENTRAL GYRUS.

ADDRESSING THIS CENTRAL QUESTION IS CRITICAL FOR DEVELOPING MECHANISTIC MODELS OF HEALTHY SPINAL CORD FUNCTION AND SUBSEQUENTLY ITS DISRUPTION IN DISORDERS OF THE SPINAL CORD.

HOWEVER, WIDESPREAD USE OF MOLECULAR PAI IS SEVERELY LIMITED BY AVAILABILITY OF VALIDATED CONTRAST AGENTS. CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CONTRAST AGENTS EITHER DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE PHOTOSTABILITY UNDER THE PULSED ILLUMINATION THAT IS REQUIRED FOR PAI, LACK SUFFICIENT PAI-SIGNAL-GENERATION ABILITY FOR DEEP IMAGING, OR THEIR ABSORBANCE SPECTRA SIGNIFICANTLY OVERLAP WITH THOSE OF HEMOGLOBIN, WHICH REDUCES IMAGING SENSITIVITY. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS, A NEW CLASS OF PAI CONTRAST AGENTS WAS PROPOSED THAT IS BASED ON PHASE-CHANGING PERFLUOROCARBON (PFC) NANODROPLETS (NDS). THESE AGENTS ARE BASED ON A LIQUID PFC CORE AND A LIGHT-ABSORBING \u201cFUSE\u201d IN THE FORM OF A DYE OR A NANOPARTICLE. ILLUMINATION OF THESE NDS WITH A PULSED LASER TRIGGERS LIQUID-TO-GAS TRANSITION OF THE PFC CORE HEATED BY LIGHT-ABSORBING CHROMOPHORES THAT RESULTS IN A VERY STRONG PAI SIGNAL. THEREFORE, THESE AGENTS ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS LASER-ACTIVATED NDS (LANDS). FURTHERMORE, AFTER LASER EXCITATION PFC MICROBUBBLES CAN RE-CONDENSE BACK INTO THEIR LIQUID NANODROPLET FORM, WHICH CAN ALLOW MULTIPLE EXCITATIONS AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR DYNAMIC IMAGING CONTRAST AND SUPER-RESOLUTION PAI.

IMPORTANTLY, IN ADDITION TO THE LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH IRREPRODUCIBILITY AND A SHOT SHELF-LIFE OF LANDS DUE TO LEAKAGE OF DYE MOLECULES FROM A LAND'S SHELL, RECENT STUDIES OF PHASE-CHANGING NDS SHOWED THE ADVANTAGE OF HEATING LANDS FROM WITHIN THE CORE FOR AN EFFECTIVE LIQUID-TO-GAS TRANSITION.

THE MOST COMMON TECHNIQUE FOR HYPERPOLARIZATION IS DISSOLUTION DYNAMIC NUCLEAR POLARIZATION (DNP). DNP WORKS BY ENHANCING THE NMR SIGNAL VIA THE MICROWAVE- DRIVEN POLARIZATION TRANSFER FROM ELECTRONS TO TARGET NUCLEI. WHILE DISSOLUTION DNP-NMR CAN PRODUCE DRAMATICALLY ENHANCED LIQUID STATE NMR SIGNALS, IT HAS SEVERE LIMITATIONS INCLUDING EXPENSIVE HARDWARE, THE NEED FOR A FREE RADICAL POLARIZING AGENT, EXTENDED POLARIZATION BUILD-UP TIME AT CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES AND BATCH-WISE OPERATION. AN ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUE FOR 13C HYPERPOLARIZATION IS PARA-HYDROGEN INDUCED POLARIZATION (PHIP), WHICH INVOLVES THE CHEMICAL ADDITION OF PARA-HYDROGEN (HYDROGEN GAS ENRICHED IN THE PARA SPIN ISOMER) TO UNSATURATED SUBSTRATES FOLLOWED BY THE CONVERSION OF THE SINGLET SPIN ORDER OF THE PARA-H2 INTO 13C SPIN POLARIZATION BY MAGNETIC FIELD CYCLING.

THE ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT USUALLY TAILORED FOR THE SPECIC CLINICAL TASK AND PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS, LEADING TO SUB-OPTIMAL IMAGES; THEY ARE OFTEN LOW-RESOLUTION, BLURRY, OR CONTAIN ERRORS THAT CAN REDUCE THEIR DIAGNOSTIC EFCACY. DYNAMIC IMAGING APPLICATIONS, IN WHICH MANY IMAGES MUST BE CAPTURED QUICKLY TO DEPICT THE MOTION OF ORGANS SUCH AS THE HEART, TEND TO SUFFER THE MOST FROM THESE ILL-EFFECTS. WE PROPOSE TO REPLACE THE CONVENTIONAL DYNAMIC MRI ACQUISITIONS WITH A MACHINE LEARNING-BASED ACQUISITION SYSTEM, WHERE THE DATA SAMPLING IS EFCIENTLY OPTIMIZED TOGETHER WITH THE RECONSTRUCTION APPROACH AND TASK PREDICTION, FOR OPTIMIZED IMAGE QUALITY AND CLINICAL TASK PERFORMANCE. FIRST, WE WILL EXPLORE AND COMPARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LEARNING FAST SAMPLING OF MRI FRAMES TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY METRICS USING LARGE PUBLIC DATA SETS AND CURRENT SOPHISTICATED (ITERATIVE) RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS. WE WILL AS- CERTAIN THE SAMPLING LEARNING STRATEGIES THAT ACHIEVE THE BEST IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY AT HIGH DATA UNDERSAMPLING FACTORS.

THIS APPROACH CAN LEAD TO A RANGE OF BEHAVIORS THAT COMPROMISE PATIENT OUTCOMES, INCLUDING OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF THE PHYSIOLOGY, ERRORS DUE TO COGNITIVE OVERLOAD, AND PHYSICIAN TO PHYSICIAN VARIABILITY IN DECISION MAKING. A COMPUTATIONAL TOOL EQUIPPED WITH QUANTITATIVE KNOWLEDGE OF PHYSIOLOGY, THE ABILITY TO SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE ALL THE DATA, AND INFORMED BY A DATABASE OF PAST ACTION-OUTCOME EVENTS COULD AID THE PHYSICIAN WITH VALUABLE SUGGESTIONS FOR ACTION.

BETWEEN THE INITIAL IDENTIFICATION OF A TUMOR AND POSITIVE LYMPH NODES, CHEMOTHERAPY APPLICATION AND SURGERY, SEVERAL MONTHS CAN PASS. BEFORE NAC, TUMOR, LESIONS AND SUSPICIOUS LYMPH NODES ARE OFTEN MARKED WITH RADIOLOGICAL CLIPS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO RE-IDENTIFY THEM BEFORE SURGERY. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE APPEARANCE OF THE TUMORS AND LYMPH NODES CAN CHANGE OR EVEN NORMALIZE OVER THE COURSE OF NAC.  IN RECENT YEARS, A MULTITUDE OF CLIPS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING BETTER IMAGE CONTRAST AND IDENTIFICATION UNDER REAL-TIME IMAGING WITH MODALITIES SUCH AS ULTRASOUND. ULTRASOUND IS PREFERRED IN THESE APPLICATIONS BECAUSE IT IS SAFE, REAL TIME, PORTABLE AND CAN BE USED AT THE BEDSIDE. INITIALLY IT WAS THOUGHT THAT SIMPLE CLIP DESIGNS MADE FROM METAL WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH CONTRAST FOR ULTRASOUND THAT LOCATING THE CLIPS IN B-MODE ULTRASOUND WOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD. HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE, IDENTIFICATION OF RADIOLOGICAL CLIPS CAN BE DIFFICULT AS MULTIPLE BRIGHT SCATTERERS IN THE IMAGING FIELD CAN LOOK IN APPEARANCE SIMILAR TO THE SIGNAL FROM A CLIP. AS A RESULT, OVER TIME NEW CLIPS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT HAVE A VARIETY OF SHAPES AND SIZES, DIFFERENT SURFACE TEXTURES AND COMPOUND MATERIAL PROPERTIES.

EFFORTS TO IMPROVE RATES OF GROSS TOTAL RESECTION IN LGG HAVE BEEN SPARSE AND LARGELY FOCUSED ON HIGH GRADE TUMORS.

ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WITH FLEXIBLE ENDOSCOPIC INTERVENTIONS IS THE LIMITATION IN FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE ENDOSCOPE AND THE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE PASSED THROUGH THE WORKING PORT. INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY HAVE A FIXED ORIENTATION TO THE DISTAL SCOPE TIP AND, IN MOST CASES, ONLY CAN BE ADVANCED ALONG THE AXIS OF SCOPE TIP. ADDITIONALLY, SCOPE FLEXIBILITY AND MANEUVERABILITY REDUCES WITH AN INSTRUMENT PRESENT, FURTHER LIMITING DEXTERITY. WORKING WITHIN THE NARROW CONFINES OF A BRONCHUS OR TRACHEA LIMITS THE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY DIRECT INSTRUMENTS TO LESIONS OR BIOPSY TARGETS.

CURRENT IMPLANTS MAINLY CONSIST OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC ANTENNA, ELECTRONICS, AND ENERGY-STORAGE AND CONVERSION UNITS. HOWEVER, THESE UNITS CONTAIN TOXIC MATERIALS, AND A LARGE ANTENNA IS NECESSARY TO TRANSMIT THE LARGE WAVELENGTHS (>5 CM) OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES. THE SIZE AND INORGANIC COMPONENTS OF THE CURRENT IMPLANTS INCREASE THE RISK OF COMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENTS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO UTILIZE FLEXIBLE, ACOUSTIC MICRORESONATORS (100 TO 500 \u039cM THICK FILMS) WITH COMPRESSIBLE MICROCAVITIES FOR PHYSIOLOGICAL PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS OF ATRIUMS AND VENTRICLES. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE POST-PROCESSING OF ECHO SIGNALS FROM THE RESONATORS AND THEIR RESONANT FREQUENCIES CAN DETECT INTRACARDIAC PRESSURE CHANGES. OUR RATIONALE IS THAT MICRO-FABRICATED FILMS MADE FROM POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (PDMS) FORM ACOUSTIC RESONATORS. INCORPORATING GAS/VOID FILLED MICROCAVITIES INTO THE PDMS FILM CREATES A RESONATOR THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. CHANGING THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CAUSES DEFORMATIONS OF THE RESONATOR. THESE DEFORMATIONS SHIFT THE FILM'S RESONANT FREQUENCY ALLOWING FOR THE DETECTION OF PRESSURE CHANGES. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO 1) PROVE THE MEASUREMENT SENSITIVITY OF THE RESONATOR UNDERWATER AT THE VENTRICULAR AND ATRIAL PHYSIOLOGICAL PRESSURES WITH THE RESOLUTION OF ~1MMHG AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION OF 40 (MS); 2) DEMONSTRATE THE SAFETY OF AN IMPLANTABLE DEVICE IN VITRO BY INCORPORATING HEMOCOMPATIBLE MATERIALS, TESTING A DEVICE'S DURABILITY, AND TESTING IN A SPECIALLY DESIGNED PHANTOM; AND 3) PROVE THAT THE IMPLANT IS SUITABLE FOR A MINIMALLY INVASIVE DELIVERY (TRANSSEPTAL PROCEDURE) ON A BENCHTOP TEST SETUP.

BY CORRELATING THE DELIVERED PAYLOAD TO THE PH DISTRIBUTION, WE WILL CONFIRM THE ABILITY OF DNA-SPPS TO DELIVER CARGO PREFERENTIALLY IN ACIDIC REGIONS, WHERE HARD- TO-REACH BACTERIA TEND TO CLUSTER.

ONE OF THE MAJOR TREATMENTS USED FOR HCC IS EMBOLIZATION, I.E. BLOCKING THE BLOOD VESSELS FEEDING A TUMOR WITH MICROBEADS. DRUG-ELUTING BEADS (DEBS) ARE FREQUENTLY USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. DESPITE THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEBS, PATIENT SURVIVAL RATE IS ONLY 27% AT 5 YEARS. THIS MAY BE DUE TO POOR DRUG ELUTING CHARACTERISTICS AND INCOMPLETE EMBOLIZATION SINCE THE BEADS ARE LARGE COMPARED TO THE SIZE OF TUMOR CAPILLARIES. AT THE SAME TIME, BEING TYPICALLY RADIOLUCENT, THOSE BEADS CANNOT BE VISUALIZED VIA IMAGING, SO IT IS CHALLENGING TO ASSESS THEIR SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT DURING THE PROCEDURE. THEREFORE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS THAT CAN BLOCK BLOOD VESSELS, HAVE TUNABLE DRUG RELEASE, AS WELL AS INCORPORATE MATERIALS WITH RADIOPAQUE PROPERTIES, WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS.

COMPARED TO FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING, MEG IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN LOCALIZING AND TRACKING BRAIN ACTIVITIES THANKS TO ITS HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. STATE-OF-THE-ART MEG EMPLOYS EITHER SUPERCONDUCTING QUANTUM INTERFERENCE DEVICE (SQUID) OR MICROFABRICATED OPTICALLY PUMPED MAGNETOMETERS (\u039cOPMS) AS THEIR SENSING ELEMENTS. SQUID PROVIDES THE HIGHEST SENSITIVITY BUT REQUIRES CRYOGENIC COOLING, WHICH SEVERELY LIMITS ITS PORTABILITY. \u039cOPM OFFERS AN EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE WITH MUCH REDUCED FORM FACTOR. HOWEVER, IT STILL REQUIRES THERMAL INSULATION (HEATING AS OPPOSED TO CRYOGENIC COOLING) AND IT HAS A RATHER LIMITED BANDWIDTH AND DYNAMIC RANGE COMPARED TO SQUID.  THE PROPOSED NEW TYPE OF MAGNETOMETER IS DESIGNED TO GREATLY IMPROVE THE SIGNAL STRENGTH AND BANDWIDTH, REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF ACTIVE SHIELDING AND FURTHER DECREASE THE MINIMUM CHANNEL SPACING. THE SENSING ELEMENT CONSISTS OF UNIFORMLY DISPERSED MAGNETITE NANOPARTICLES THAT OPERATE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. THERMAL INSULATION IS NO LONGER NEEDED, AND THUS THE SENSING ELEMENT CAN BE PLACED AS CLOSE AS 1 MM TO THE HUMAN SCALP, INCREASING THE SIGNAL STRENGTH. THE SYSTEM BANDWIDTH IS NOT FUNDAMENTALLY LIMITED BUT SET TO BE 1 KHZ BY CHOICE SO THAT HIGH-QUALITY ELECTRONICS CAN BE UTILIZED WHILE MAINTAINING THE CAPABILITY TO DETECT ALL NEURAL ACTIVITIES FROM DELTA TO HIGH GAMMA FREQUENCY BANDS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM EMPLOYS CHIP-SCALE KERR FREQUENCY COMB AS THE LIGHT SOURCE AND BALANCED IN-LINE SAGNAC INTERFEROMETER AS THE OPTICAL READOUT.

WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE USE OF DIFFERENT DOPANT SPECIES AND SURFACE PASSIVATION TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ACHIEVE HIGH VERDET CONSTANT, LOW INSERTION LOSS, AND GOOD LONG-TERM STABILITY FOR MEG APPLICATIONS. SECOND, WE WILL INCORPORATE A NOVEL CHIP-SCALE FREQUENCY COMB SOURCE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPERATE AN ARRAY OF MM-SIZE MAGNETOMETER SENSOR HEADS. WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS TWO- MODE SQUEEZING PROPERTY FOR NOISE REDUCTION TO BELOW THE QUANTUM LIMIT AND FURTHER ENHANCE THE DETECTION SENSITIVITY OF OUR MULTICHANNEL MAGNETIC GRADIOMETER. AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM, WE WILL BENCHMARK AND VALIDATE OUR TECHNOLOGY BY A PRELIMINARY IN VIVO STUDY OF TWO NORMAL HUMAN SUBJECTS UNDER AUDITORY STIMULATION.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A LASER SPECKLE FIELD MICRORHEOLOGY (SLIM) TECHNOLOGY FOR MICROMECHANICAL MAPPING OF THE TISSUE ECM, WITH LATERAL RESOLUTION OF 10 \u039cM, AXIAL RESOLUTION OF 60 \u039cM, AND A PENETRATION DEPTH OF 5 MM PENETRATION DEPTH. ECM STIFFNESS, AS PERCEIVED BY CELLS, IS EMERGING AS A PROMINENT MICRO-MECHANICAL CUE THAT PRECEDES PATHOGENESIS AND DIRECTS ITS PROGRESSION BY ORCHESTRATING NEARLY ALL ASPECTS OF CELLULAR BEHAVIOR. EXCESSIVE AND IRREGULAR MICRO-MECHANICAL REMODELING OF THE ECM IS IMPLICATED IN A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PATHOLOGIES, INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, FIBROTIC DISORDERS, AND CANCER, WHICH TOGETHER ACCOUNT FOR OVER 50% OF DEATH WORLDWIDE. NEVERTHELESS, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS IS SEVERELY LIMITED AS CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO IMAGING TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR MICROMECHANICAL MAPPING OF THE ECM AT LENGTH SCALES PERTINENT TO CELLS. SLIM MEASURES THE TIME-VARYING SPECKLE INTENSITY FLUCTUATIONS. SPECKLE IS A GRAINY INTENSITY PATTERN, FORMED WHEN A COHERENT LASER BEAM IS BACK SCATTERED FROM TISSUE. BROWNIAN DISPLACEMENTS OF SCATTERING PARTICLES WITHIN THE ECM DYNAMICALLY MODULATE THE SPECKLE FLUCTUATIONS. THESE FLUCTUATIONS IN TURN ARE INTIMATELY RELATED TO THE VISCOELASTIC PROPERTIES OF IMAGED TISSUE. IN COMPLIANT REGIONS, UNRESTRICTED BROWNIAN DISPLACEMENTS PROVOKE RAPIDLY FLUCTUATING SPECKLE SPOTS, WHEREAS IN RIGID AREAS, RESTRAINED MOTIONS ELICIT LIMITED INTENSITY VARIATIONS OF SPECKLE GRAINS. PIXEL-WISE CORRELATION ANALYSIS OF INTENSITY FLUCTUATIONS PROVIDES A 2D DEPTH-INTEGRATED MAP OF MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITHIN THE TISSUE. HOWEVER, THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MAP IS LIMITED TO THE SPECKLE GRAIN SIZE, SET BY THE NUMERICAL APERTURE (NA) OF OPTICS. IN ADDITION, DUE TO MULTIPLE SCATTERING OF LIGHT, SPECKLE FLUCTUATIONS ARE MODULATED BY THE BROWNIAN DISPLACEMENTS OF THE SCATTERING PARTICLES WITHIN THE ENTIRE ILLUMINATED VOLUME. AS A RESULT, THE EVALUATED MAP LACKS DEPTH INFORMATION. THEREFORE, THE FIRST GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY INTRODUCING AN INNOVATIVE SLIM PLATFORM, CAPABLE OF HIGH RESOLUTION, DEPTH-RESOLVED, LARGE FOV, MICROMECHANICAL MAPPING OF THE ECM, WITHOUT PHYSICAL SCANNING AND REFOCUSING ON THE SAMPLE. OUR SECOND GOAL IS THEN TO IDENTIFY THE LINK BETWEEN THE MICROMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF ECM AND KNOWN HALLMARKS OF DISEASE PROGRESSION, BY FOCUSING ON BREAST CANCER AS A MODEL. THE UNIQUE CAPABILITY OF SLIM FOR MICRO-MECHANICAL TOMOGRAPHY OF ECM ENABLES IDENTIFYING THE KEY BIOMECHANICAL MEDIATORS OF PATHOGENIES. IT ALSO OPENS MULTIPLE AVENUES BASED ON TARGETING THE CELL-ECM MICROMECHANICAL INTERACTIONS FOR THERAPEUTIC MANAGEMENT OF DISEASE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance

CHALLENGES IN INTER-OBSERVER ASSESSMENT VARIABILITY AND OVERLAP WITH NORMAL NEONATAL BEHAVIOR LEADS TO SUBSTANTIAL AMBIGUITY AND VARIATION IN CARE, CONTRIBUTING TO DELAYS IN TREATMENT AND DISCHARGE. NEONATAL WITHDRAWAL IS EXPRESSED PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH AUTONOMIC HYPEREXCITABILITY, WHICH CAN BE DETECTED THROUGH QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NON-INVASIVE HEART RATE (HR) AND OXYGENATION (SPO2). A CRITICAL GAP EXISTS IN THE OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF NOWS; NO CURRENT DEVICE OR TEST CAN PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE MONITORING OR PREDICTION OF WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS. CLOSING THIS GAP USING AN OBJECTIVE ALGORITHM WOULD PAY ENORMOUS DIVIDENDS IN BOTH THE NEWBORN NURSERY AND THE NEONATAL ICU. PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT SIGNATURES OF NOWS CAN BE DETECTED USING CONTINUOUS PULSE OXIMETRY DATA ANALYTICS AND THESE CORRELATE WITH CLINICAL MARKERS OF WITHDRAWAL SEVERITY. TRANSLATING FEATURES OF NOWS IN PULSE OXIMETRY DATA INTO A REAL-TIME OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF WITHDRAWAL WOULD PROVIDE AN ACTIONABLE TOOL FOR PROVIDERS AND DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE PRIMARY GAP IN THE CARE OF THESE VULNERABLE INFANTS. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL USE DATA FROM TERM INFANTS TO REFINE AND VALIDATE A PULSE OXIMETRY WITHDRAWAL SCORE (POWS) FOR NOWS SYMPTOM MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT.

CURRENTLY, THE ONLY CURE FOR SCD IS A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT BUT THE COST AND DIFFICULTY OF THIS PROCEDURE RESULTS IN SCD PATIENTS OFTEN CHOOSING TO INSTEAD MANAGE THEIR DISEASE WITH TREATMENTS AND ROUTINE MONITORING. HOWEVER, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO OBJECTIVE MEASURE OR LAB TEST TO DETERMINE VOCS AND ASSOCIATED PAIN SEVERITY. ROUTINE MONITORING OF RED BLOOD CELL (RBC) HEALTH, HOWEVER, COULD PROVIDE A WINDOW FOR AVOIDING VOCS AND ENABLE MORE THOROUGH, QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE A PROTOTYPE DEVICE SUITABLE FOR USE AT THE POINT OF CARE FOR MONITORING SCD PATIENTS BY ADVANCING A NOVEL TECHNOLOGY FOR RAPID, AUTOMATED, HIGH THROUGHPUT RED BLOOD CELL (RBC) IMAGING. THE APPROACH IS BASED ON QUANTITATIVE PHASE IMAGING (QPI) TO CREATE A HOLOGRAM OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL RBC IN A SAMPLE. THESE IMAGING DATA CAN THEN BE EVALUATED FOR THE PROPORTION OF SICKLED CELLS USING MACHINE LEARNING. FURTHER, SINCE UP TO 10^6 RBCS ARE IMAGED IN EACH SAMPLE, A LARGE VOLUME OF DATA WILL BE OBTAINED, SUITABLE FOR DEVELOPING AI ALGORITHMS THAT CAN REVEAL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SIGNIFICANTLY, THE DEVICE IS COMPACT AND LOW COST, INDICATING THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR TRANSLATION TO A POINT OF CARE DEVICE. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL SEEK TO TRANSLATE OUR TECHNOLOGY, WITH DEMONSTRATED HIGH THROUGHPUT IMAGING CAPABILITIES, TO REALIZE A PROTOTYPE DEVICE SUITABLE FOR USE IN CLINICAL TRIALS. THEY KEY DEVELOPMENT STEPS INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMAGING DEVICE TO ENABLE A ROBUST, COMPACT FORM FACTOR, ADVANCING THE DESIGN OF THE MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE THAT CARRIES THE RBC'S AND CREATING NEW AND IMPROVED ALGORITHMS TO ENABLE HIGH THROUGHPUT SEGMENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE OBTAINED IMAGING DATA.

IN ADDITION, MDR CANCER IS HIGHLY RESISTANT TO TREATMENTS THAT INDUCE CONVENTIONAL PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH, SUCH AS CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION. FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMBATING APOPTOSIS MEDIATED MDR, NEW DRUG DISCOVERIES ARE BEING DIRECTED TOWARDS THERAPIES THAT INDUCE APOPTOSIS-INHIBITING PROCESSES, SUCH AS NECROPTOSIS, AUTOPHAGY, PARAPTOSIS, METHUOSIS, AND FERROPTOSIS. WHEN OPTIMIZING NEW CHEMICAL MOLECULES DURING THE EARLY PHASES OF DRUG DISCOVERY, TWO KEY QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED: A) THE ABILITY OF THE DRUG TO KILL CANCER CELLS, AND B) THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THE DRUG KILLS CANCER CELLS. AT PRESENT, CONVENTIONAL BIOCHEMICAL ASSAYS AND HIGH-DEFINITION IMAGING ARE THE ONLY METHODS FOR STUDYING THESE PROCESSES, BUT THEY ARE TIME CONSUMING, COSTLY, AND REQUIRE SKILLED EXPERTS, THUS LIMITING THEIR UTILITY TO A SMALL NUMBER OF LABORATORIES. WE PROPOSE A PARADIGM-ALTERING PHENOTYPIC SCREENING TOOL THAT IDENTIFIES CELL DEATH MECHANISMS IN REAL TIME USING HIGH-RESOLUTION WIDEFIELD MICROSCOPY COUPLED WITH DEEP LEARNING. FIRST, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A LOW-COST WIDEFIELD HOLOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPE, WITH MULTI-WAVELENGTH ILLUMINATION, INCLUDING ULTRAVIOLET (UV), TO ENABLE HIGH CONTENT SCREENING WITHOUT EXTERNAL LABELING, AT HIGH RESOLUTION THAT EXCEEDS THE DIFFRACTION LIMIT. WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS BY INTEGRATING LENS-LESS HOLOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPY WITH MICROPARTICLE ARRAY-BASED IMAGING SUBSTRATES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO IMAGE THOUSANDS OF LIVE CELLS PER TEST. UV ILLUMINATION MAY PROVIDE EXTRA INFORMATION ABOUT NUCLEI AND OTHER ORGANELLES OF CELLS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS USED SPARINGLY. USING TIME LAPSE IMAGES OF CANCER CELLS, A 3D- CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WILL BE TRAINED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES, SUCH AS SHRINKING, BLEBBING, VACUOLES AND MEMBRANE RUPTURES, ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT CELL DEATH PROCESSES. DURING THE INCUBATION STEP, RESULTS WILL BE OBTAINED IN REAL TIME, USING THE PRE-TRAINED NETWORK FOR AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION OF THE CELL DEATH PROCESS.

CARDIAC DISEASE CONTRIBUTES TO DEATH OF ABOUT 655,000 AMERICANS EACH YEAR. MINIMALLY INVASIVE ROBOT-ASSISTED (MIRA) PROCEDURES CAN REVOLUTIONIZE THE TREATMENT OF CARDIAC DISEASE. AS COMPARED TO OPEN HEART SURGERY, MIRA PROCEDURES CAN DRAMATICALLY MINIMIZE THE RECOVERY TIME, RISK OF INFECTION, AND AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY IN HOSPITAL.

TO DEVELOP THIS NOVEL TRANSCATHETER ROBOT WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS:  AIM 1: DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A SIX DOF RECONFIGURABLE SOFT PARALLEL ROBOT TO FIT INSIDE THE EXISTING CATHETERS. THE SOFT PARALLEL ROBOT IS INSPIRED FROM THE STRUCTURE OF A THREE UNIVERSAL-SPHERICAL-REVOLUTE (3USR) PARALLEL ROBOT. THE 3USR PARALLEL ROBOT HAS SIX DOF AND CAN BE USED FOR PRECISION SURGERY PROCEDURES. HOWEVER, THIS MECHANISM HAS A RIGID STRUCTURE AND CANNOT BE SQUEEZED TO BE FITTED INSIDE A CATHETER AND DELIVERED INSIDE THE HEART. TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE, THE RIGID STRUCTURE OF THE 3USR ROBOT WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO A SOFT AND RECONFIGURABLE STRUCTURE THAT CAN BE FITTED INSIDE A CATHETER USING THE SOFT ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGY.  AIM 2: DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTUITIVE MECHANISM FOR POSITION CONTROL OF THE ROBOT. THE MANUAL JOINT SPACE CONTROL KNOBS IN THE EXISTING CHARACTER SYSTEMS ARE NOT INTUITIVE AND REQUIRE EXTENSIVE TRAINING FOR THE SURGEONS TO UNDERSTAND THE REQUIRED KNOB ADJUSTMENTS TO NAVIGATE THE CATHETER TIP. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE DEVELOP A MASTER/SLAVE SYSTEM USING A TWIN STEWART MECHANISM AS A SPECIAL JOYSTICK WITH 6 DOF. THIS IS ADVANTAGEOUS BECAUSE THE ROBOT\u2019S MOTION WOULD BE VERY INTUITIVE, AND THE SURGEON CAN CONTROL THE ROBOT END- EFFECTOR JUST BY ONE HAND. CONSEQUENTLY, AS THE SURGEON MOVES OR ROTATES THE JOYSTICK IN ANY GIVEN POSITION OR ORIENTATION THE ROBOT FOLLOWS THAT ACCORDINGLY.

KNOWING THE INITIAL MECHANICAL STATES THAT LEAD TO ADIPOGENESIS ALLOWS PRESCREENING OF STEM CELLS SO THAT THE LESS VIABLE ONES CAN BE ELIMINATED, THEREBY INCREASING THE PROCESS YIELD. THE TIME HISTORY OF THE FORCES ACTING BETWEEN CELLULAR AND SUBCELLULAR STRUCTURES AND THE UID SURROUNDING THEM DURING ADIPOGENESIS IS EXAMINED TO DETERMINE AREAS WHERE THE PROCESS TIME CAN BE REDUCED. THE HIGH-DELITY, HIGH-SPEED SIMULATION PRODUCES THESE TIME HISTORIES IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, WHICH ALLOWS US TO ITERATIVELY SEARCH FOR TIME SAVINGS AND INITIAL CONDITIONS AND VERIFY THEM USING EXPERIMENTS. IN THIS MANNER, THE TYPICAL TRIAL AND ERROR SEARCH FOR CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO ADIPOGENESIS IS SHIFTED TO THE SIMULATION, RATHER THAN ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH LENGTHY EXPERIMENTS. THIS APPROACH YIELDS SOLUTIONS FOR INCREASING THE YIELD AND DECREASING THE PROCESSING TIME FOR ADIPOGENESIS IN MUCH LESS TIME THAN A PURELY EXPERIMENTAL OR NUMERICAL APPROACH COULD. THE SUCCESS OF THIS STUDY WILL YIELD A TEMPLATE FOR COMBINING EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTER SIMULATIONS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF MANY BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT AFFECT HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7ed0ee91-c2b9-af52-1843-b1a4d78f9683-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R15EB030842_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110464452, "Award ID": "R15EB030815", "Award Amount": 426940.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-15", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "RE-ENGINEERING TUMOR CELL-DERIVED EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES WITH EXOGENOUS TAGS FOR DOWNSTREAM ANALYSIS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "30fb4abe-a613-ffb1-33a4-35aae1a55dc3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R15EB030815_7529"}, {"internal_id": 137121776, "Award ID": "R15EB030809", "Award Amount": 442546.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-18", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "MAPPING ACTIVENESS OF VERY SMALL TUMORS IN BREAST FOR PATIENT STRATIFICATION - PROJECT SUMMARY DESPITE DRAMATIC PROGRESSES, MANY CHALLENGES STILL EXIST AND SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS ARE NEEDED IN BREAST CANCER RESEARCHES, SUCH AS: (1) DISTINGUISH ACTIVE (OR AGGRESSIVE) FROM INACTIVE (OR LESS AGGRESSIVE) BREAST CANCERS AND (2) CONQUER THE PROBLEMS OF OVERDIAGNOSIS AND OVERTREATMENT. VERY SMALL TUMORS IN BREASTS (VST, <10 MM, STAGE T1A, T1B) ARE DETECTED MORE AND MORE DUE TO INCREASING SENSITIVITY OF SCREENING TECHNOLOGIES. COMPARED WITH RELATIVELY LARGE LESIONS (>10 MM), VSTS ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO BE RADIOGRAPHICALLY DIAGNOSED BECAUSE TUMOR\u2019S DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES HAVE NOT BEEN WELL DEVELOPED. EVALUATION OF VST\u2019S ACTIVENESS VIA IMAGING IS EVEN MORE CHALLENGING. THUS, THE DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS OF VSTS HAVE TO RELY ON PATHOLOGICAL AND GENETIC ASSESSMENTS, WHICH GENERATES A LARGE AMOUNT OF UNNECESSARY BIOPSIES AND PATIENT\u2019S ANXIETY, AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES MEDICAL COST. IN FACT, BIOPSY RESULTS SHOW ABOUT 80% VSTS ARE BENIGN. ABOUT 15% ARE INACTIVE OR LOW GRADE CANCERS (LESS AGGRESSIVE OR INDOLENT) AND ONLY ABOUT 5% ARE AGGRESSIVE CANCERS. IF MISSING THE AGGRESSIVE VSTS OR LEAVING THEM UNTREATED, IT CAN INCREASE BREAST CANCER MORTALITY. HOWEVER, IF CONDUCTING BIOPSY FOR EACH VST, IT CAN LEAD TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF UNNECESSARY BIOPSIES, AND OVER-DIAGNOSIS AND OVER-TREATMENT ARE SIGNIFICANT. IF VST\u2019S ACTIVENESS CAN BE EVALUATED VIA AN IMAGING TECHNOLOGY, PATIENTS CAN BE APPROPRIATELY STRATIFIED INTO DIFFERENT GROUPS BASED ON THE ACQUIRED ACTIVENESS/AGGRESSIVENESS BEFORE BIOPSIES. FOR INACTIVE OR BENIGN VSTS, BIOPSIES MAY BE AVOIDED AND THESE VSTS CAN BE MONITORED IN A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME (SUCH AS IN A YEAR). FOR LESS ACTIVE TUMORS, BIOPSIES CAN BE AN OPTION DEPENDING OTHER INDICATIONS. CLOSELY MONITORING CAN BE FOLLOWED UP (SUCH AS IN 6 MONTHS). FOR OBVIOUS ACTIVE VSTS, PATHOLOGICAL AND GENETIC ASSESSMENTS CAN BE SUGGESTED. IF THESE ASSESSMENTS SHOW HIGHLY ACTIVE/AGGRESSIVE BUT METASTASES HAVE NOT OCCURRED, LUMPECTOMY CAN BE SUGGESTED. IF METASTASES ARE ALSO FOUND, MASTECTOMY MAY BE AN OPTION. FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHOSE VSTS ARE EVALUATED AS ACTIVE AND SURGICALLY REMOVED, SYSTEMIC ADJUVANT TREATMENTS (SUCH AS CHEMOTHERAPIES) CAN BE SUGGESTED TO REDUCE THE RECURRENCE AND METASTASIS RATES. WHILE THOSE PATIENTS WHOSE VSTS ARE EVALUATED AS LESS INACTIVE OR LOW GRADE BUT ARE SURGICALLY REMOVED, LOCAL RADIATION ADJUVANT THERAPY (NOT SYSTEMIC THERAPIES) CAN BE SUGGESTED TO AVOID SIDE-EFFECTS OR OVER- TREATMENT. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A NEW IMAGING TECHNOLOGY TO QUANTIFY TUMOR\u2019S ACTIVENESS OR AGGRESSIVENESS BY MAPPING TISSUE\u2019S LOCAL TEMPERATURE AND METABOLIC RATE. THE LOGIC IS THAT ACTIVE OR AGGRESSIVE CANCER CELLS HAVE HIGH METABOLIC RATE AND LEAD TO HIGH LOCAL TUMOR TEMPERATURE. THIS GOAL CAN BE ACHIEVED USING OUR RECENTLY DISCOVERED TEMPERATURE SUPER-SENSITIVE PROBES AND A HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING TECHNOLOGY IN CENTIMETER-DEEP TISSUES, ULTRASOUND-SWITCHABLE FLUORESCENCE.

THIS PROTOCOL, CURRENTLY AVAILABLE PRIMARILY AT SELECT RESEARCH FACILITIES, HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO BE SUPERIOR FOR QUANTITATIVE CARDIAC PERFUSION IMAGING. YET, DYNAMIC NUCLEAR IMAGING HAS ALMOST NO PENETRATION IN CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS. THE REASON IS A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES, THE MOST NOTICEABLE ONE BEING ITS UNREASONABLY LONG SCANNING TIME. OUR PRINCIPAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE UNIQUE DIAGNOSTIC PARAMETERS LIKE MYOCARDIAL BLOOD FLOW AND CORONARY FLOW RESERVE CAN BE OBTAINED BY DYNAMIC IMAGING ACQUISITION OVER A MUCH SHORTER SCAN TIME THAN WHAT IS BEING PRACTICED TODAY. REDUCING THE SCAN TIME WILL REMOVE THE PRIMARY IMPEDIMENT OF TRANSLATING DYNAMIC NUCLEAR IMAGING TO THE CLINIC. OUR OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACHIEVED WITH INNOVATIVE ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT FOR THE TWO NUCLEAR IMAGING MODALITIES: SINGLE PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (SPECT) AND POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET). PREVIOUSLY WE HAVE DEVELOPED CUTTING-EDGE ALGORITHMS BASED ON A NOVEL MATHEMATICAL TOOL CALLED NON-NEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION (NMF) FOR BOTH OF THESE MODALITIES. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL ADVANCE THESE ALGORITHMS SIGNIFICANTLY TOWARD OUR OBJECTIVE, WHILE ALSO IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF ESTIMATING DIAGNOSTICALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE WILL DEVELOP ADDITIONAL HIGH-LEVEL MATHEMATICAL COMPONENTS LIKE TOPOLOGY-BASED ANALYSIS OF 1D TIME-SERIES DATA AND ANATOMICAL SHAPES OF ORGANS TO GUIDE THE SOLUTION IN THE DATA ANALYSIS. WE WILL VALIDATE OUR RESULTS WITH REALISTIC NUMERICAL PHANTOMS AND CLINICAL DATA WITH THE RADIOTRACER 13NH3 IN PET AND 99TC-TETROFOSMIN IN SPECT. ANONYMIZED RETROSPECTIVE DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM OUR COLLABORATORS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO (UCSF). THE SUCCESS OF OUR PROJECT WILL BRING THE APPLICATION OF DYNAMIC CARDIAC NUCLEAR IMAGING CLOSER TO CLINICAL UTILIZATION BY PROVING ITS QUANTITATIVE CAPABILITY TO BE DIAGNOSTICALLY MORE USEFUL THAN THE CURRENTLY PRACTICED STATIC IMAGING, AND THUS, WILL ADD MORE VALUE TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF CAD, SAVING LIVES AND COST. IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPING THE NEW IMAGE PROCESSING APPROACH. WE WILL WORK ON AUTOMATING THE DYNAMIC DATA ANALYSIS, AS CURRENTLY, THE NEED FOR MANUAL INTERVENTION IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF SUBJECTIVITY AND COST. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL INCLUDE EXPERIENCED MEDICAL PHYSICS RESEARCHERS AND DYNAMIC SPECT IMAGING PIONEERS AS CO-INVESTIGATORS, A MEDICAL IMAGING DATA ANALYST AS A PAID CONSULTANT, AND A NUCLEAR MEDICINE PHYSICIAN AND A NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGIST AS SUPPORTING PERSONNEL. THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE A VITAL STUDENT TRAINING COMPONENT WITH COLLABORATION FROM THE UCSF. IF SUCCESSFUL, OUR APPROACH WILL BE APPLIED IN LARGER SCALE STUDIES FOR CLINICAL VALIDATION AT UCSF, USING ADDITIONAL IMAGING AGENTS FOR MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING.

ACID-PROTOPORPHYRIN IX FOR FLUORESCENCE-GUIDED TUMOR RESECTION AND TREATMENT - THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO DETERMINE TUMOR PHENOTYPIC AND GENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT REDUCE TUMOR PROTOPORPHYRIN IX FLUORESCENCE AND DESIGN MECHANISM-BASED APPROACHES TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITING FACTORS \u2013 THIS FIRST RENEWAL BUILDS ON PROGRESS MADE IN OUR INITIAL FUNDING PERIOD. SURGERY IS THE MOST COMMON TREATMENT FOR ALL TYPES OF SOLID TUMORS. A SUCCESSFUL CANCER SURGERY IS TO COMPLETELY REMOVE TUMOR TISSUES AND MAXIMALLY PRESERVE NORMAL STRUCTURES. TO IMPROVE CANCER SURGERY ACCURACY AND PRECISION, FLUORESCENT MOLECULAR PROBES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND ARE BEING INCREASINGLY USED IN THE ONCOLOGICAL SURGERY. FLUORESCENCE FROM INTRAOPERATIVE MOLECULAR PROBES ENABLES SURGEONS TO VISUALIZE TUMOR TISSUES IN REAL TIME AND PERFORM FLUORESCENCE-GUIDED RESECTION (FGR). IT HAS BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED THAT FGR LEADS TO MORE COMPLETE TUMOR RESECTION AND BETTER SURGICAL OUTCOMES THAN CONVENTIONAL SURGERY UNDER WHITE LIGHT. AMINOLEVULINIC ACID (ALA) IS ONE OF A FEW FDA-APPROVED INTRAOPERATIVE FLUORESCENT PROBES AND THE ONLY MOLECULAR PROBE BASED ON THE METABOLIC ALTERATIONS IN TUMOR CELLS. ALA HAS NO FLUORESCENCE ON ITS OWN AND NEEDS TO BE METABOLIZED IN THE HEME BIOSYNTHESIS PATHWAY IN TUMOR CELLS TO PRODUCE A FLUORESCENT AND PHOTOSENSITIZING METABOLITE PROTOPORPHYRIN IX (PPIX), WHICH ENABLES TUMOR FLUORESCENCE IMAGING AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY (PDT). ALTHOUGH ALA-PPIX HAS BEEN CLINICALLY USED FOR TUMOR FGR, ITS APPLICATIONS ARE LIMITED BY LOW TUMOR PPIX FLUORESCENCE, HIGH TUMOR FLUORESCENCE HETEROGENEITY, AND LOW TUMOR-TO-NORMAL TISSUE FLUORESCENCE CONTRAST. STUDIES IN THE INITIAL FUNDING PERIOD OF THIS AWARD HAVE LED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF ABCG2 TRANSPORTER ACTIVITY AS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN REDUCING TUMOR PPIX FLUORESCENCE. IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED CLINICALLY USED AGENTS TO SUPPRESS ABCG2 ACTIVITY TO ENHANCE TUMOR PPIX FLUORESCENCE. IN THIS RENEWAL, WE WILL USE AN FDA-APPROVED DRUG LAPATINIB (LAP), THE MOST POTENT ONE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOR THE ENHANCEMENT OF TUMOR PPIX FLUORESCENCE, AND HYPOTHESIZE THAT LAPATINIB IMPROVES THE USE OF ALA FOR FGR AND PDT OF GLIOMAS. WE CHOSE TO STUDY THIS ENHANCEMENT STRATEGY IN GLIOMAS BECAUSE ALA IS NOW PRIMARILY USED FOR GUIDING THE RESECTION OF GLIOMAS AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, ABCG2 EXPRESSION ELEVATION IS A COMMON FEATURE IN HUMAN GLIOMAS. TO THIS END, WE WILL EVALUATE LAP IN COMBINATION WITH ALA FOR THE ENHANCEMENT OF PPIX FLUORESCENCE AND PDT RESPONSE IN HUMAN GLIOMA CELL LINES WITH DIFFERENT GENOTYPE AND PHENOTYPE (AIM 1) AND GLIOMA TUMOR MODELS (AIM 2). THROUGH THIS RESEARCH, WE HOPE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT LAP IN COMBINATION WITH ALA ENHANCES TUMOR PPIX FLUORESCENCE AND PDT RESPONSE.

THEY CAN BE OBSERVED IN A VARIETY OF CONTEXTS: THE BLINKING OF FIREFLIES, THE MARCHING OF AN ARMY OF LOCUSTS, THE SCHOOLING OF FISH, THE AGGREGATION OF SOCIAL BACTERIA, AND VIRAL ATTACKS. THEY ARE EVEN OBSERVED IN THE MOVEMENT OF INANIMATE OBJECTS, SUCH AS ROBOT SWARMS. COLLECTIVE BEHAVIORS OCCUR ON ALL SCALES OF LIVING SYSTEMS; SYNCHRONOUS BEHAVIORS EXTEND FROM THE ORGANISM TO THE TISSUE, TO THE CELL, TO THE MOLECULE. IRONICALLY, RESEARCH ON COLLECTIVE BEHAVIORS IS NOT COORDINATED. DISPARATE SCIENTIFIC GROUPS WORK ON THESE PHENOMENA IN MANY DISCIPLINES, INCLUDING EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, MICROBIOLOGY, MATHEMATICS, PHYSICS, AND ENGINEERING. ALTHOUGH THE PROBLEMS BEING PURSUED HAVE EXCITING OVERLAPS, INTERACTION BETWEEN GROUPS HAS BEEN SPARSE. WE PROPOSE THREE STEPS TO CREATE A UNIFIED AND ENDURING RESEARCH COMMUNITY COMMITTED TO THE STUDY OF COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR BY PROVIDING TRANS-DISCIPLINARY BRIDGES: (1) BUILD A TRANS-DISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY OF COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR RESEARCHERS BY HOLDING A BIANNUAL GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCE (GRC) ON COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR, (2) BUILD AN ENDURING INCLUSIVE TRANS-DISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY OF COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR RESEARCHERS BASED AROUND THIS GRC BY RECRUITING PARTICIPANTS FROM UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS; AND 3) ESTABLISH A PERMANENT VENUE FOR THE GRC ON COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR. TO BEGIN THIS COMMUNITY BUILDING AND TO PROMOTE THIS NEW INTER-DISCIPLINARY FIELD, WE WILL HOLD THE FIRST GRC ON COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR AUGUST 13 - 18, 2023 AT GRAND SUMMIT HOTEL AT SUNDAY RIVER, NEWRY, ME.  THE GOAL OF THIS CONFERENCE IS TO ESTABLISH TRANS-DISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN SCIENTISTS TO SHARE INFORMATION, APPROACHES, AND TECHNOLOGIES IN A COORDINATED EFFORT TO TRANSFORM INVESTIGATIONS OF COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXPECT THE CONFERENCE WILL PROMOTE THE DISCOVERY OF UNIFYING PRINCIPLES ACROSS SCALES AND ORGANISMS AND UNCOVER HOW THE FINDINGS, BOTH EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL, CAN BE USED IN FUTURE EXPERIMENTATION, COMPUTATION, ROBOTICS, AND MEDICAL APPLICATIONS. MOREOVER, THE CONFERENCE WILL HELP TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW COLLECTIVE BEHAVIORS EMERGE FROM THE BEHAVIOR OF SINGLE COMPONENTS, SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS, CELLS OR MOLECULES.  SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE INVITED SPEAKERS AND DISCUSSION LEADERS (AND MOST LIKELY THE ATTENDEES) FOCUS THEIR RESEARCH ON AREAS THAT ARE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR NIBIB. THIS INCLUDES USING SYNTHETIC AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND MATHEMATICAL MODELING AND SIMULATIONS TO ANALYZE COLLECTIVE BEHAVIORS IN BOTH ANIMATE AND INANIMATE SYSTEMS. THE RESEARCHERS IN THIS EMERGING FIELD OF STUDY WOULD BE A RICH SOURCE OF NEW NIBIB INVESTIGATORS.

THE MOST CELEBRATED EXAMPLE IS THE UNIQUE COMBINATION OF FLEXIBILITY AND CONFINING ABILITY OF CELL MEMBRANES WHICH IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE LIPIDS COOPERATIVELY AGGREGATE INTO A LAMELLAR LC PHASE IN WATER. THE PHASE SEPARATION UNDERLYING THE LIPID RAFT PARADIGM OF PLASMA MEMBRANE ORGANIZATION BEARS ALL THE HALL- MARKS OF INTER-LC PHASE TRANSITIONS, AS DOES SEPARATION IN SUSPENSIONS OF AMYLOIDOGENIC PROTEIN FIBRILS IN ALZ- HEIMER'S DISEASE. MANY VIRUSES, E.G., SARS-COV-2, ARE ENVELOPED IN A LIPID MEMBRANE AND THEY MAY EMPLOY LC ORDER FOR PACKING THEIR NUCLEIC ACID CARGO. NON-BIOLOGICAL LCS HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE SENSITIVE IN DETECTING AND REPORTING ON THE PRESENCE OF PATHOGENS AND TOXINS, MAKING THEM HIGHLY INTERESTING FOR AUTONOMOUS BIO- /CHEMOSENSORS. LC FORMATION IS THUS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF WHAT KEEPS US HEALTHY AND CAUSES DISEASE, AND THEY ARE EMERGING AS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR DETECTING DISEASE AGENTS. ALTHOUGH THIS CONNECTION IS KNOWN SINCE LONG, IT HAS UNTIL NOW BEEN RESEARCHED ONLY MARGINALLY, CONSTITUTING AN UNDER-EXPLORED OPPORTUNITY IN ADDRESSING SOCI- ETAL NEEDS. TODAY, THE INTERNATIONAL LC RESEARCH COMMUNITY IS UNDERGOING A REBIRTH, FULLY EMBRACING THESE AS- PECTS. INTERDISCIPLINARY CROSSOVERS WHERE LC SCIENCE MEETS BIOLOGICAL, LIFE AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, AND ENGINEERING AND MATERIALS SCIENCE, PLAY A GROUNDBREAKING ROLE IN LEVERAGING THE OPPORTUNITIES.

GROUNDED IN DECADES OF WORK IN FUNDAMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY, THE PAST DECADE HAS SEEN A SPIKE IN INTEGRATION OF PRINCIPLES FROM ENGINEERING AND THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES INTO IMMUNOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND ALREADY INCLUDES BREAKTHROUGH IMMUNOTHERAPIES FOR CANCER. HOWEVER, THE IMMUNOENGINEERING COMMUNITY DOES NOT YET HAVE A FLAGSHIP CONFERENCE THAT BRINGS TOGETHER ALL OF ITS DIFFERENT SUB-UNITS. WORKSHOPS HELD AT INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSITIES AND SYMPOSIA WITHIN LARGER CONFERENCES HAVE BEEN WELL ATTENDED, BUT AN INTERNATIONALLY ACCESSIBLE AND DISCUSSION-FOCUSED CONFERENCE THAT SUPPORTS NETWORKING BETWEEN GENERATIONS OF RESEARCHERS AND ACROSS FIELDS HAS BEEN MISSING. SUCH A CONFERENCE IS NEEDED TO BRING TOGETHER LEADERS, NEW INVESTIGATORS, AND TRAINEES FROM DISPARATE FIELDS FOR THE FIRST TIME, TO ADVANCE BOTH TRANSLATIONAL AND FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE AND TO PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT FOR COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS, CAREER GUIDANCE, AND MENTORING OF TRAINEES IN THIS FIELD. THEREFORE, THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS PARTIAL SUPPORT FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MEETING ON IMMUNOENGINEERING AS PART OF THE GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCE (GRC) SERIES, TO BE HELD IN VENTURA, CA IN JULY 2022. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE CONFERENCE ARE (I) TO INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS OF IMMUNOENGINERRING AT THREE LEVELS \u2014 BASIC RESEARCH, TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES, AND CLINICAL PRACTICE \u2014 BY PROMOTING ENGAGEMENT AND LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS FIELDS, (II) TO ADVANCE THE CAREERS OF NEW INVESTIGATORS AND TRAINEES IN THE FIELD OF IMMUNOENGINEERING BY SHOWCASING THEIR WORK AND FACILITATING NETWORKING WITH SENIOR INVESTIGATORS AND PEER MENTORS, AND (III) TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION AMONG NEW INVESTIGATORS AND TRAINEES IN IMMUNOENGINEERING VIA STRONG REPRESENTATION AT THE MEETING. THE PROGRAM WILL HAVE A KEYNOTE ADDRESS AND NINE SESSIONS THAT BROADLY ADDRESS GROWTH AREAS OF IMMUNOENGINEERING, MOLECULARLY ENGINEERED IMMUNOTHERAPIES, BIOMATERIALS FOR VACCINES AND IMMUNOMODULATION, SYSTEMS AND COMPUTATIONAL IMMUNOLOGY, IN VITRO MODELS OF IMMUNITY, MICRO-TECHNOLOGIES TO ASSESS IMMUNE CELL FUNCTION, CELLULAR IMMUNOEINEERING, AND TRANSFORMATIVE TOOLS FOR IMMUNOLOGICAL RESEARCH. EACH SESSION WILL FEATURE 1-2 SHORT TALKS SELECTED FROM ABSTRACTS TO HIGHLIGHT WORK BY EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATORS, AS WELL AS POSTER SESSIONS AND AN INNOVATIVE LUNCH-BASED NETWORKING STRATEGY. WE WILL IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION OF WOMAN AND HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES BY SETTING ASIDE SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR SUCH INDIVIDUALS, TARGETED ADVERTISING, AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SHORT TALKS. THUS, THE 2022 IMMUNOENGINEERING GRC WILL SET THE STAGE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND TRANSLATION IN IMMUNOENGINEERING BY PROMOTING ENGAGEMENT AND LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS FIELDS, WHILE SUPPORTING A DIVERSE BASE OF YOUNG INVESTIGATORS TO ENSURE ITS FUTURE STRENGTH.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "RI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "234b0bf7-6dda-7f84-f2b9-918a2cc6cba3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R13AI169685_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160601460, "Award ID": "R03EB034871", "Award Amount": 88450.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-21", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "THREE-DIMENSIONAL, PORTABLE, INEXPENSIVE, AND REUSABLE TOMOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPY - PROJECT SUMMARY THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) MICROSCOPY OFFERS MANY PROMISES FOR BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND MEDICAL APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, IT IS CURRENTLY LIMITED TO WELL-RESOURCED LABORATORIES IN SETTINGS WITH ESTABLISHED INFRASTRUCTURE. MANY 3D MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES (E.G., CONFOCAL) RELY ON FOCUSING LIGHT AT AN ARRAY OF SMALL LOCATIONS WITHIN THE SAMPLE, WHICH REQUIRES EXPENSIVE AND SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT. OPTICAL PROJECTION TOMOGRAPHY (OPT) IS A 3D IMAGING TECHNIQUE THAT UTILIZES TRADITIONAL MICROSCOPY EQUIPMENT; INSTEAD OF FOCUSING THE LIGHT AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS, OPT IMAGES A SAMPLE FROM MANY ANGLES TO RECONSTRUCT A 3D VOLUME. IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR 3D IMAGING OF SMALL TRANSLUCENT OBJECTS (E.G., MOUSE FETUSES, PARASITES, AND LARGE BACTERIA). WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR OPT TO BE A LOWER-COST METHOD OF 3D MICROSCOPY, EXISTING SYSTEMS REMAIN EXPENSIVE AND LARGE. WE PROPOSE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE UBIQUITOUS AND HIGH-QUALITY COMPUTING AND IMAGING HARDWARE AVAILABLE IN SMARTPHONES TO MAKE AN OPT DEVICE THAT IS INEXPENSIVE AND EXTREMELY PORTABLE. WE WILL CREATE A SMARTPHONE EXTENSION THAT ROBUSTLY IMAGES A ROTATING SAMPLE AND USES THE PHONE\u2019S COMPUTATIONAL HARDWARE TO RECONSTRUCT THE 3D VOLUME. TWO IMAGING MODALITIES WILL BE PURSUED: VISIBLE-BAND ATTENUATION MICROSCOPY (E.G., BRIGHTFIELD) AND LUMINESCENT MICROSCOPY (E.G., BIOLUMINESCENT). THE COMPONENTS OF THE SMARTPHONE EXTENSION ARE EITHER 3D PRINTED, LASER CUT ACRYLIC, OR READILY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. THUS, THE COST OF MANUFACTURING THE DEVICE IS EXTREMELY SMALL AND THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF THE DEVICE IS VERY LOW; THE TOTAL COST OF ALL COMPONENTS WILL BE LESS THAN $50. THE COMPONENTS OF THE EXTENSION ARE EASILY ASSEMBLED ON SITE, PERMITTING THE DEVICE TO BE TRANSPORTED WITH IN A SMALL PACKAGE. DUE TO ITS LOW COST AND SIZE, THE OPT MICROSCOPE CAN ALSO SERVE AS A USEFUL TOOL FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES (E.G., AS PART OF AN UNDERGRADUATE LABORATORY COURSE INVOLVING OPTICS) AND FOR GENERATING REAL DATA FOR TOMOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT. TO VALIDATE THE DEVICE, WE WILL BUILD TWO PHANTOMS WITH THREE-DIMENSIONAL FEATURES THAT ALLOW US TO EVALUATE THE MODULATION TRANSFER FUNCTION: ONE FOR ATTENUATION MICROSCOPY AND ANOTHER FOR LUMINESCENT MICROSCOPY.

AIM 1A: IMPLEMENT 3D CONE-BEAM RECONSTRUCTION FROM VISIBLE-BAND SINOGRAM DATA FOR SAMPLES APPROXIMATELY 10 MM IN SIZE WITH APPROXIMATELY 10 \u039cM RESOLUTION. AIM 1B: IMPROVE THE IMAGE RESOLUTION WITH A MULTI-LENS OPTICAL SYSTEM. AIM 2: IMPLEMENT BIOLUMINESCENT TOMOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPY BY APPROPRIATELY MODIFYING THE TOMOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM.

DECENTRALIZED PROCESSING APPROACHES ARE BECOMING THE PREFERRED APPROACH FOR MULTI-SITE DATA COLLECTION BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT IMPROVED PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION AND ARE SCALABLE. USING A DECENTRALIZED APPROACH, THE ENHANCING NEURO IMAGING GENETICS THROUGH META ANALYSIS (ENIGMA) STUDIES PRODUCED SEMINAL FINDINGS ACROSS DIFFERENT DISORDERS. HOWEVER, THE DMRI PIPELINE ESTABLISHED FOR DECENTRALIZED ENIGMA DMRI STUDIES IS NOT AUTOMATIC, NOT USER FRIENDLY, AND REQUIRES EACH SITE TO HAVE STRONG PROGRAMMING AND DMRI EXPERTISE, WHICH IS NOT THE CASE IN MANY CLINICAL SITES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE SITE-LEVEL TECHNICAL BURDENS, WHICH WOULD PROMOTE DECENTRALIZED STUDIES BY ENABLING THE ADDITION OF MORE SITES. DECENTRALIZED MULTI-SITE STUDIES ARE NEEDED FOR RIGOROUS AND STATISTICALLY ROBUST IDENTIFICATION OF SUBTLE NEUROLOGICAL CHANGES, BUT THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH MAKE DECENTRALIZED DMRI ANALYSIS HIGHLY RESOURCE- INTENSIVE, ARE IMPEDING RESEARCH SITES FROM PARTICIPATING. THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF MULTIPLE SOFTWARE TOOLS AND THEIR SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES, ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE SCRIPTING STEPS THAT ARE HARD TO FOLLOW FOR NOVICE USERS, AND QUALITY CONTROL (QC) STEPS THAT REQUIRE EXPERTISE IN DMRI. THE CENTRAL GOAL OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO DEVELOP A USER-FRIENDLY DMRI ANALYSIS PLATFORM FOR DECENTRALIZED STUDIES WHICH WILL FACILITATE THE PROCESSING AND QC BY PURSUING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DEVELOP AN AUTOMATED DMRI PROCESSING PIPELINE WITH EXTENSIVE DATA QC STEPS; AND 2) PROVIDE DASHBOARD FUNCTION AND CONTAINERIZE THE PIPELINE. UNDER THE FIRST AIM, VARIOUS NEUROIMAGING AND IMAGE PROCESSING UTILITIES WILL BE LINKED TOGETHER TO AUTOMATIZE THE DMRI PROCESSING PIPELINE WHILE ESTIMATING EXTENSIVE QC MEASURES, WHICH WILL BE CURATED FOR NON-DMRI EXPERTS TO HELP INTUITIVELY UNDERSTAND THE DATA QUALITY. FOR THE SECOND AIM, A WEB-SERVER WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE A DASHBOARD THAT IS USED TO INTERACT WITH THE PIPELINE AND VISUALIZE THE OUTPUTS.

THE MACROMOLECULAR PRO-DRUG MATERIALS ARE CURED THERMOSETS IN WHICH EVERY REPEATING UNIT IN THE POLYESTER CHAINS CONTAINS AN EQUIVALENT OF E2. THESE CROSSLINKED POLYESTER RESINS UNDERGO SLOW HYDROLYTIC DEGRADATION TO RELEASE LOW DOSES OF ESTROGEN, LOCALLY AT THE SITE OF IMPLANTATION, FOR EXCEPTIONALLY LONG TIME PERIODS (UP TO MANY YEARS). TRANSDERMAL MICRONEEDLE PATCHES OFFER MINIMALLY INVASIVE, PAINLESS ADMINISTRATION OF ESTROGEN. THESE DELIVERY METHODS ENHANCE PATIENT COMPLIANCE RELATIVE TO REPEATED INJECTIONS WITH HYPODERMIC NEEDLES AND THEY REQUIRE LOWER DOSES THAN ORAL ADMINISTRATION DUE BY AVOIDING FIRST-PASS HEPATIC CLEARANCE. OF ALL THE MANY ADVANCED MNP TECHNOLOGIES, THERE ARE STILL NO EXAMPLES OF MNPS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF POLY(PRO-DRUG). OUR LAB HAS DEVELOPED A NEW CLASS OF POLYMERIZABLE ESTROGEN PRO-DRUGS CONTAINING PENDANT ALKENE GROUPS. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL POLYMERIZE THE PRO-E2 MONOMERS IN A MICRONEEDLE MOLD. A KEY INNOVATION IS THAT WE PLAN TO TUNE THE GLASS TRANSITION OF THE POLYMER NETWORK SUCH THAT THE NEEDLES ARE HARD AND GLASSY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR SKIN PENETRATION, BUT THEN THEY TRANSITION INTO A SOFT/RUBBERY MATERIAL UPON EQUILIBRATION TO PHYSIOLOGICAL TEMPERATURE.

METALS SUCH AS PLATINUM, RUTHENIUM AND COPPER ARE USED IN CHEMOTHERAPY. YTTRIUM AND INDIUM ARE USED IN RADIOTHERAPY. NEODYMIUM, EUROPIUM AND TERBIUM ARE FINDING APPLICATION IN LUMINESCENT PROBES. COPPER, GALLIUM AND WHOLE HOST OF OTHER METAL ISOTOPES CAN BE USED IN PET AND SPECT IMAGING. GADOLINIUM IS WIDELY USED IN MRI, WHILE MANGANESE IS PROPOSED AS AN ALTERNATIVE. HOWEVER, THESE ADVANTAGEOUS PROPERTIES COME WITH A PRICE: THE RISK OF METAL ION TOXICITY. TO MAKE METALS SAFE FOR MOST IN VIVO APPLICATION THEY MUST BE HELD TIGHTLY IN A COORDINATING LIGAND. THE PURPOSE OF THIS LIGAND IS TO SHIELD THE BODY FROM THE METAL ION, AVOIDING THE BODY\u2019S NATURAL METAL TRANSPORT AND STORAGE SYSTEMS AND PERMIT THE METALLO-PHARMACEUTICAL TO PERFORM AS INTENDED. BUT MOST CRUCIALLY THIS LIGAND ALLOWS THE METAL ION TO BE EXCRETED. BROADLY SPEAKING, METALS FALL INTO ONE OF TWO CATEGORIES: 1) THOSE TO WHICH EVOLVING LIFE WAS EXPOSED AND TOOK ADVANTAGE: THE ESSENTIAL MINERALS. AND 2) THOSE TO WHICH EVOLVING LIFE HAD NO EXPOSURE AND ARE NOT NORMALLY FOUND IN LIFEFORMS: THE XENOBIOTIC METALS (WHICH INCLUDES MANY OF THE HEAVY METALS). ONE MIGHT EXPECT THAT THESE TWO CLASSES OF METAL ION WOULD BE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT, BUT, THEY SHARE A COMMON FEATURE IN BIOLOGY: NEITHER CAN BE EXCRETED. XENOBIOTIC METALS BECAUSE THESE PATHWAYS NEVER DEVELOPED AND ESSENTIAL MINERALS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO VALUABLE TO LOSE. CLEARLY METAL IONS ESCAPING FROM THE LIGANDS IN WHICH THEY ARE ADMINISTERED REPRESENTS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND RISK TO HUMAN HEALTH. ONCE OUT OF THE LIGAND THEY ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE BODY AND CAN NEVER LEAVE. THIS MEANS THAT THE COMPLEXES FORMED BETWEEN METAL AND LIGAND MUST BE AS ROBUST AS POSSIBLE.

TRANS-ORAL SURGICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS TRANS-ORAL ROBOTIC SURGERY (TORS) AND TRANS-ORAL LASER MICROSURGERY (TLM) ARE EFFECTIVE, REDUCING COMPLICATIONS AND LONG-TERM TREATMENT MORBIDITY. ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS OF THE TRANS-ORAL APPROACH IS THE DIFFICULTY IN INTRAOPERATIVELY ASSESSING TUMOR EXTENT AND LOCATING CRITICAL VASCULAR STRUCTURES, RESULTING IN POSITIVE MARGINS AND RISKS OF VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS. IMAGE GUIDANCE AND SURGICAL NAVIGATION PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN SINUS, SKULL BASE, AND NEUROSURGERY, DEMONSTRATING IMPROVEMENT IN THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THESE PROCEDURES. THERE MAY BE ADVANTAGES TO APPLYING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO TRANS-ORAL SURGERY (TOS) FOR IMPROVED ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR DEPTH AND AVOIDANCE OF VASCULAR STRUCTURES. IMAGE GUIDANCE IS CURRENTLY NOT FEASIBLE FOR TRANS-ORAL SURGERY. THE MAIN REASON IS THE SIGNIFICANT INTRAOPERATIVE TISSUE DEFORMATION THAT OCCURS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF RETRACTORS NEEDED TO PROVIDE SURGICAL ACCESS. THIS INTRAOPERATIVE DEFORMATION LIMITS THE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY REGISTER PREOPERATIVE IMAGING TO THE INTRA-OPERATIVE STATE. WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF INTRA-OPERATIVE CT AND MRI IMAGING AT DARTMOUTH\u2019S UNIQUE CENTER FOR SURGICAL INNOVATION, INTRA-OPERATIVE IMAGING IS FEASIBLE. HOWEVER, CURRENT METALLIC INSTRUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR EXPOSURE AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT DURING TRANS-ORAL SURGERY CREATES SIGNIFICANT ARTIFACT ON CT IMAGING. AS PART OF AN ON-GOING NIH-FUNDED R21 PROGRAM (1R21CA246158-01A1), WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NOVEL 3D PRINTED POLYMER RETRACTOR THAT ENABLES US TO ACQUIRE ARTIFACT FREE IMAGES OF CADAVER HEAD DURING TRANS-ORAL SURGERY PROCEDURES AND A SURGICAL NAVIGATION FRAMEWORK TO ENABLE IMAGE-GUIDED TRANS-ORAL ROBOTIC SURGERY. THE WORK IN THIS R21 IS BEING PERFORMED ON BENCHTOP MODELS AND CADAVER HEADS.

THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WHEN TREATING ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONS (AVMS), WHERE VEINS AND ARTERIES ARE ENTANGLED AND NEED TO BE CAREFULLY IDENTIED. THE PRESENTED PROJECT AIMS AT ENHANCING DSA IMAGE SERIES TO REMOVE THIS DIFCULTY. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTUITIVE AND INTERPRETABLE VISUALIZATION TOOLS TO IMPROVE THE DIAGNOSIS, PLANNING AND TREATEMENT OF NEUROVASCULAR PATHOLOGIES. OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVES IN THIS PROJECT ARE TO (I) DEVELOP A NEW METHOD, BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING, TO LOCALIZE THE AVM AND DISTINGUISH BETWEEN VEINS AND ARTERIES SURROUNDING IT IN DSA IMAGE SERIES, AND (II) DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM THAT CLASSIES ARTERIES AS TERMINAL, EN PASSAGE OR BYSTANDERS.

TO ATTAIN THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES, THE FOLLOWING TWO SPECIC AIMS WILL BE PURSUED: (1) DEVELOP AN IMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHM FOR AVM LOCALISATION AND ARTERY/VEIN CLASSICATION AND (2) DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM THAT CAN IDENTIFY ARTERIES AS TERMINAL, EN PASSAGE OR BYSTANDERS. UNDER THE RST AIM, WE WILL TEST OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS TO SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOCALIZE AN AVM IN DSA IMAGE SERIES AND TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FEEDING ARTERIES AND DRAINING VEINS SURROUNDING OR CREATING THE ENTANGLEMENT, USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS TO OUTLINE THE SHAPE OF THE AVM IN THE IMAGES AND INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND BLOOD OW DISRUPTION. FOR THE SECOND AIM, WE WILL ESTABLISH A SET OF RULES TO CLASSIFY ARTERIES CONTRIBUTING OR NOT TO THE AVM AND IMPLEMENT THESE RULES INTO A DYNAMIC INSTANCE SEGMENTATION ALGORITHM THAT WILL TRACE VESSELS INDIVIDUALLY, IN A DSA IMAGE SERIES. THIS ALGORITHM WITH RELY ON A FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION TO GENRATE A VASCULAR GRAPH AND ON DEEP NEURAL NETWORK TO CLASSIFY VASCULAR JUNCTIONS TO PRODUCE AN INSTANCIATED GRAPH. USING THIS GRAPH AND THE PRE-DENED RULES IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO VISUALLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ARTERY PATTERNS.

THIS IS PROVIDED THAT THESE STRATEGIES CAN OVERCOME THE TRANSLATIONAL CHALLENGES OF TARGETED DELIVERY, IMPROVED SPECIFICITY AND CELLULAR INTERNALIZATION. THIS PROJECT OUTLINES TWO STRATEGIES TO COUPLE THESE ADVANCED SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TECHNIQUES WITH NOVEL SUPRAMOLECULAR POLYMERS TO ADDRESS THESE SIGNIFICANT HURDLES CURRENTLY FACING THE FIELD. SUPRAMOLECULAR POLYMERS PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE CELLULAR INTERNALIZATION, PROVIDE DYNAMIC PRESENTATION OF PROTEIN BINDING LIGANDS AND PROVIDE THE POTENTIAL FOR MULTIVALENT, AND IN TURN HIGHER AFFINITY, BINDING INTERACTIONS WITH TARGET PROTEINS. THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT COULD UNLOCK A VAST ARRAY OF NEW DRUG TARGETS, PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE UNDRUGGABLE, WHILE CIRCUMVENTING THE RELIANCE ON SMALL MOLECULE THERAPEUTICS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS WITH DRUG RESISTANCE. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE OPPORTUNITY OF DYNAMIC SUPRAMOLECULAR POLYMERS AS A STRATEGY TO ENHANCE THE EFFICACY OF TARGETED PROTEIN DEGRADATION THERAPIES THE MISFOLDING OR MISREGULATION OF PROTEINS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANY DISEASES INCLUDING NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, CANCERS AND FIBROTIC DISORDERS. SMALL MOLECULE DRUGS, DESIGNED TO INHIBIT PROTEIN FUNCTION IS THE CURRENT GOLD STANDARD IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLINICALLY-USED THERAPEUTIC AGENTS AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, TO ACHIEVE CLINICALLY RELEVANT PROTEIN INHIBITION, GREATER THAN 90% TARGET BINDING IS REQUIRED, RESULTING IN HIGH DOSING LEVELS THAT CAN RESULT IN OFF-TARGET EFFECTS. FURTHER, THESE APPROACHES ARE ONLY SUITABLE WHEN THE PROTEIN TARGET HAS AN ACTIVE BINDING SITE SUITABLE FOR INHIBITION. WHAT ABOUT THE PROTEINS THAT DON\u2019T HAVE AN ACTIVE BINDING SITE OR CONTRIBUTE TO DISEASE THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS? WHAT IF THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY TO NOT JUST INHIBIT BUT TO SELECTIVELY DEGRADE THESE ABERRANT PROTEINS AS A THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY?

THE MALFORMATION RESULTS IN EXCESSIVE STRESS ON THE VENOUS WALL, AND CAN CAUSE THE RUPTURING OF OVERSTRESSED VEINS. BRAIN AVMS ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNING SINCE BRAIN HEMORRHAGE HAS THE MOST SEVERE COMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING SEIZURES AND NEUROLOGIC DEFICITS. THE MORTALITY RATE AFTER BRAIN AVM RUPTURE RANGES FROM 12%-66.7%, AND 23%-40% OF SURVIVORS HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY. FURTHERMORE, LOCALIZED INFLAMMATION IS FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BRAIN AVM PROGRESSION AND RUPTURE. ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG THERAPY MAY, THEREFORE, BE A POSSIBILITY TO STABILIZE BRAIN AVMS. CURRENT TREATMENT FOR BRAIN AVMS INCLUDES MICROSURGERY, EMBOLIZATION AND RADIOSURGERY. IN EMBOLIZATION, WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF THIS WORK, LIQUID EMBOLIC AGENTS ARE DELIVERED THROUGH CATHETERS TO EMBOLIZE UPSTREAM OR WITHIN THE AVM SHUNT, AIMING TO RETURN VENOUS PRESSURE TO NORMAL. THE MAIN CHALLENGE IN EMBOLIZING AVMS STEMS FROM THE DIFFICULTY INVOLVED WITH ADEQUATELY PENETRATING THE DENSE, TORTUOUS AND LOW RESISTANCE NIDUS. PROXIMAL OCCLUSION LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLATERAL VESSELS, PROMOTING ANGIOGENESIS. THEREFORE, BLOCKAGE OF BOTH NIDUS AND THE FEEDING ARTERIES IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL EMBOLIZATION. CURRENT FDA APPROVED EMBOLIC SYSTEMS FOR BRAIN AVM EMBOLIZATION INCLUDE ONYX AND N-BUTYL CYANOACRYLATE. BOTH ARE LIQUID EMBOLIC AGENTS THAT UNDERGO LIQUID- SOLID TRANSITION ONCE IN CONTACT OF BLOOD. THEY ARE INTENDED TO TRAVEL DISTALLY FROM THE SITE OF RELEASE TO PENETRATE FINE VASCULATURE. DESPITE CLINICAL AVAILABILITY, BOTH LIQUIDS HAVE SIGNIFICANT DRAWBACKS AND CANNOT SERVE AS CURATIVE TREATMENT OF AVM. LIMITATIONS INCLUDE TOXICITY FROM ORGANIC SOLVENTS, DIFFICULTY IN DELIVERY, DANGER OF BEING WASHED AWAY, LACK OF UNIVERSALITY TO BLOCK WIDE RANGE OF VASCULATURE SIZES, NO INTRINSIC RADIOPACITY FOR VISUALIZATION ON X- RAY, AND LACK OF THERAPEUTICS.

A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHARMACOKINETICS OF SILICA NANOPARTICLES IN HUMANS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR CLINICAL TRANSLATION. PHYSIOLOGICALLY BASED PHARMACOKINETIC (PBPK) MODELING IS WELL ESTABLISHED STRATEGY TO TRANSLATE MECHANISTIC KNOWLEDGE FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP PBPK MODELS OF SILICA NANOPARTICLES IN MICE AND RATS AND EXTRAPOLATE THEM TO HUMANS TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGAN ACCUMULATION, AND HUMAN DOSE. PBPK MODELS INTEGRATE COMPOUND SPECIFIC DATA WITH PHYSIOLOGY OF THE ORGANISM TO PREDICT THE PHARMACOKINETICS OF DRUGS.

TO FULLY LEVERAGE THIS ADVANTAGE, PROTON RANGE MUST BE PRECISELY CONTROLLED, MONITORED, AND VERIFIED. SMALL ERRORS IN PARTICLE DELIVERY CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DOSE DELIVERED TO HEALTHY TISSUE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY MINIMAL DOSE DELIVERED TO TARGET VOLUME. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF CLINICAL SOLUTIONS FOR PROTON RANGE VERIFICATION. CURRENT APPROACHES EMPLOY EITHER POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET)-BASED OR PROMPT GAMMA IMAGING (PGI)-BASED TECHNIQUES, WHICH EXPLOIT THE SECONDARY EMISSIONS FROM CHARGE PARTICLE TRACKS. PET IS ENABLED FOR PROTON RANGE VERIFICATION DUE TO POSITRON EMITTING NUCLEI CREATED IN THE CHARGE PARTICLE TRACKS. UNFORTUNATELY, RADIONUCLIDES OF INTEREST FOR THIS TECHNIQUE CAN HAVE A HALF-LIFE AS LONG AS 20 MINUTES, WHEREIN SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL WASHOUT CAN OCCUR, DEGRADING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN ANNIHILATION PHOTON ORIGIN AND THE ORIGINAL PROTON TRACK LOCATION.

CHALLENGE: USCT IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION PRESENTS A HISTORICAL CHALLENGE OF HEAVY COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY, DUE TO ITS NON-LINEAR, NON-CONVEX NATURE. TO OUR BEST KNOWLEDGE, ALL EXISTING USCT ALGORITHMS WITH HIGH DELITY ARE ITERATIVE, OPTIMIZATION-BASED, AND THUS SUFFER A HEAVY COMPUTATION LOAD. THIS COMPUTATION LOAD IS ESPECIALLY CUMBERSOME WHEN HIGHER NUMBER OF TRANSDUCERS ARE ADDED TO THE SYSTEM TO OBTAIN MORE ANATOMICAL INFORMATION. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP AN USCT IMAGING METHOD TO PROVIDE HIGH DELITY AND HIGH SPEED AT THE SAME TIME TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT OF GUIDED INTERVENTION. METHOD: WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BOUNDARY CONTROL METHOD WILL ACHIEVE NON-ITERATIVE USCT IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION, LEADING TO SIGNICANT INCREASE IN COMPUTATIONAL EFCIENCY WHILE WARRANTING DELITY AND ROBUSTNESS TO NOISE.

THE SURFACE TENSION OF MUCUS IS INFLUENCED BY PATHOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN THE LUNGS. WHILE RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS ARE IMPORTANT BIOMARKERS CRITICAL TO DIAGNOSE AND EVALUATE PROGRESSION OF DISEASES, RHEOMETRY INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY DEVELOPED FOR INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS.

NOTING THAT PAD ALTERS ARTERIAL PULSE WAVEFORMS, THE ANALYSIS OF ARTERIAL PULSE WAVEFORMS (CALLED THE PULSE WAVEFORM ANALYSIS (PWA)) HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVANCING THE ACCURACY AND CONVENIENCE OF PAD DIAGNOSIS. IN PARTICULAR, PWA CAN OUTPERFORM TECHNIQUES BUILT UPON DISCRETE FEATURES IN THE ARTERIAL PULSE WAVEFORMS (E.G., ABI) BY EXPLOITING THE ARTERIAL PULSE WAVEFORMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY. IN ADDITION, PWA CAN BE REALIZED WITH ARTERIAL PULSE WAVEFORMS CONVENIENTLY MEASURED AT THE EXTREMITY SITES (E.G., ARM AND ANKLE, WHICH ARE ALREADY BEING EMPLOYED IN ABI).

BY BREAKING A SINGLE COMPLEX SYSTEM-LEVEL COINCIDENCE PROCESS INTO MANY SIMPLE DETECTOR-PAIR-LEVEL PROCESSES, DCP CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PROCESSING DELAY AT EACH CP LEVEL AND THEREFORE INCREASE THE OVERALL DATA THROUGHPUT, EVEN WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF DETECTOR PAIRS.

HYPOTHYROIDISM IS A COMMON DISEASE ESPECIALLY AMONG THE ELDERLY, AFFECTING 5\u201320% OF WOMEN AND 3\u20138% OF MEN, AND IS ON THE RISE IN THE UNITED STATES. THYROID HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY IS USED FOR TREATMENT OF HYPOTHYROIDISM BUT SUFFERS FROM VARIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THERAPY OPTIMIZATION AND DOSE ADJUSTMENT. OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ULTRASOUND CAN SERVE AS A NON-INVASIVE AND NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL METHOD FOR TREATMENT OF HYPOTHYROIDISM. HERE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL EXPLORATORY STUDY TO DETERMINE IF AND HOW ULTRASOUND MAY STIMULATE AND CONTROL THYROID GLAND FUNCTION SUCH AS SYNTHESIS AND RELEASE OF METABOLIC HORMONES TRIIODOTHYRONINE (T3) AND THYROXINE (T4) IN A PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT CONTEXT.

THE LATEST GENERATION OF PET SCANNERS OFFER SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS IN SENSITIVITY WITH AN INCREASED AXIAL IMAGING EXTENT. THE SENSITIVITY GAIN IN THESE SCANNERS DIRECTLY TRANSLATES INTO IMPROVED IMAGE QUALITY IN STANDARD IMAGING PROTOCOLS AND ENABLES USE OF NEW SCAN PROTOCOLS WITH ULTRASHORT TIME FRAMES OR ULTRALOW-DOSE SCANS. THE LONG AXIAL-FIELD-OF-VIEW (AFOV) IN THESE SYSTEMS OFFERS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN ADDRESSING QUANTIFICATION BARRIERS IN PET. AMONG A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS AFFECTING THE QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY OF PET, THE EFFECTS FROM ATTENUATION, SCATTER, AND HUMAN MOTION ARE COMMON AND PREDOMINANT. IN THIS PROJECT, WE AIM TO UTILIZE THE LUTETIUM (LU) BACKGROUND RADIATION PRESENT IN THESE SCANNERS: FIRST, FOR ATTENUATION CORRECTION (AC) AND SCATTER CORRECTION (SC), AND SECOND, FOR MOTION CORRECTION (MC), WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION ON ULTRALOW-DOSE PET SCANS. AC AND SC ARE USUALLY PERFORMED USING THE ATTENUATION MAPS (\u039c-MAPS) OBTAINED FROM A COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCAN PERFORMED PRIOR TO PET. AS ULTRALOW-DOSE PET SCANS ARE NOW MADE POSSIBLE WITH LONG-AFOV PET SCANNERS, IT IS DESIRABLE TO FURTHER REDUCE THE RADIATION DOSE BY ESTIMATING THE \u039c-MAPS FROM THE LU BACKGROUND RADIATION, WHEN AN ADDITIONAL CT SCAN CAN BE AVOIDED. WE WILL PRIMARILY STUDY OUR METHODOLOGY WITH THE UEXPLORER SCANNER, WHICH IS THE WORLD\u2019S FIRST TOTAL-BODY PET SCANNER THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY IMAGE THE ENTIRE BODY, AND WILL EMPLOY THE LU BACKGROUND DATA TOGETHER WITH THE PET EMISSION DATA IN MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD RECONSTRUCTION OF ATTENUATION AND ACTIVITY (MLAA). WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE IMPROVED QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY COMPARED TO PRIOR STUDIES AS THE HIGH SENSITIVITY AND INCREASED FLUX OF BACKGROUND RADIATION ORIGINATING FROM THE LARGE VOLUME OF LU-BASED DETECTORS IN LONG-AFOV PET SCANNERS, IN ADDITION TO THE ABILITY OF SCANNING THE ENTIRE BODY IN A SINGLE BED POSITION, ENABLES MORE EFFICIENT UTILIZATION OF THE LU BACKGROUND.

BOTH SPECTRAL DOMAIN OCT (SD-OCT) AND SWEPT SOURCE OCT (SS-OCT) SYSTEMS FREQUENTLY BOAST A-LINE RATES WELL ABOVE 100 KHZ AND AS HIGH AS 400 KHZ. THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIGHER SCAN-RATES IS REDUCED MOTION ARTIFACTS AND ALSO HIGHER DATA THROUGH-PUT. MODERN ENDOSCOPIC OCT SYSTEM ARE PROPOSING SCAN-RATES THAT RESULT IN DATA RATES UPWARDS OF 1GB/S. THIS APPROACHES THE DATA TRANSFER RATE AND WRITE SPEEDS OF MODERN PCS. COMPRESSING THIS DATA AT ACQUISITION WOULD HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT ON THESE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES. THE KINDS OF TASKS BEING TACKLED IN OCT IMAGING INCREASINGLY INVOLVE WORKING WITH HIGH-RESOLUTION DATASETS WHICH COULD BE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL, WHERE DIMENSIONS INCLUDE SPACE (X,Y,Z), TIME, AND CONTRAST (POLARIZATION, ELASTOGRAPHY, PHASE SENSITIVE, DOPPLER). COMPRESSED SENSING (CS) PROVIDES TOOLS FOR DEALING WITH THESE MASSIVE DATASETS BY SAMPLING DATA FAR BELOW THE NYQUIST LIMIT TO REDUCE DATA THROUGH-PUT. BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL OF COMPRESSED SENSING TO REDUCE THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF DATA TO EXTRACT THE NECESSARY INFORMATION WITHIN AN IMAGE, COMPRESSED SENSING HAS REVOLUTIONIZED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI), ACCELERATING DATA ACQUISITION WHICH RESULTS IN SHORTED SCAN TIMES AND THUS COST SAVINGS.

TARGETS AT LARGE TISSUE DEPTHS ALSO REQUIRE LOWER IMAGING FREQUENCIES, EXACERBATING THE DEGRADATION OF RESOLUTION. THIS PROJECT BUILDS ON THE PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED SWEPT SYNTHETIC APERTURE (SSA) METHOD TO BETTER IMAGE DEEP TARGETS.

OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION (OXPHOS) CAPACITY IN SKELETAL MUSCLE ARE KNOWN TO GET COMPROMISED IN PAD AND HENCE, TOOLS (IMAGING OR OTHERWISE) ARE NEEDED FOR AIDING IN THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH PAD AND TO MONITOR THE EFFECT OF SUPERVISED EXERCISE AND REVASCULARIZATION. PHOSPHORUS (31P) MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY (31PMRS) HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED AS A NONINVASIVE TOOL TO EVALUATE THE OXPHOS CAPACITY AND THE CHANGE IN INTRACELLULAR PH OF EXERCISED SKELETAL MUSCLE. HOWEVER, IT SUFFERS FROM LOW COVERAGE, POOR SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND A VERY HIGH COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (COV) (~20-30%) WITH RESPECT TO HALF-LIFE OF PHOSPHOCREATINE RECOVERY (TPCR). OUR TEAM PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED A NOVEL 2D MRI METHOD, NAMED CREATINE CHEMICAL EXCHANGE SATURATION TRANSFER (CRCEST) IMAGING, AS AN ALTERNATIVE WITH IMPROVED SPATIAL RESOLUTION (~1X1 MM2) AND A TEMPORAL RESOLUTION (TRES) OF ~30S. RECENTLY, WE FURTHER IMPROVED ON THIS METHOD TO ENABLE THE 3D COVERAGE WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAME TRES OF 30S. THE ESTIMATION OF CREATINE RECOVERY HALF-TIME (TCR) ON A VOXEL-WISE BASIS IS CURRENTLY NOT FEASIBLE DUE TO THE COARSE TEMPORAL RESOLUTION (30S) COMBINED WITH THE LOW EFFECTIVE SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO (ESNR) (<20) OF 3D-CRCEST TIME-SERIES. RATHER, WE PERFORMED MUSCLE-GROUP-SPECIFIC FIT, WHERE THE USEFUL INFORMATION IN FORM OF A VOXEL-WISE INHERENT ANATOMIC/PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIATION WERE SACRIFICED IN RETURN FOR INCREASED SNR. IN ANOTHER IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT, WE DEVELOPED A SPATIAL REGULARIZED RECONSTRUCTION APPROACH AND SHOWED THE FEASIBILITY OF A NOISE ROBUST RECONSTRUCTION, PROVIDED TCR 4TRES. GIVEN THAT THE TYPICAL TCR OF HEALTHY CONTROL IS ~45-80S FOR OUR PLANTAR FLEXION EXERCISE PROTOCOL, THERE IS A NEED TO IMPROVE ON TRES ~10-12S. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE AIM TO IMPROVE ON THE TEMPORAL RESOLUTION: TRES OF CRCEST BY IMPLEMENTING KEYHOLE IMAGING IN COMBINATION WITH THE ALTERATION IN FREQUENCY OFFSET (FO) SCHEMES. BY AIMING TO IMPROVE TRES BY A FACTOR OF ~2-3X, THE INFORMATION CONTENT PRESENT IN CRCEST TIME SERIES WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY INCREASED TO ENABLE A NOISE ROBUST RECONSTRUCTION OF TCR-MAP. TO REDUCE THE COMPONENT OF VARIABILITY WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL ORIGINS, WE PLAN TO ADJUST THE EXERCISE LOAD TO AVOID UNPREDICTABLE AND DRASTIC CHANGES IN PERFUSION PROFILE. FOR THE VALIDATION, WE WILL COMPARE THE FINDINGS FROM THE PROPOSED APPROACH AGAINST OUR CURRENT 3D CRCEST PROTOCOL FOR COMPARABLE REGION OF INTEREST (ROI). FINALLY, WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT CLINICAL SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FUNCTION STATUS OF PAD PATIENTS POST REVASCULARIZATION WILL BE REFLECTED BY MEASURABLE CHANGES IN TCR\u2018S.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "75401b4c-967a-1918-9977-217d3ef9ce68-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R03EB030663_7529"}, {"internal_id": 139197026, "Award ID": "R03EB030653", "Award Amount": 163750.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-08-10", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "BRAIN PHANTOM GENERATION BY GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NET (GAN) FOR AI-BASED EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY - PROJECT SUMMARY  POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) AND SINGLE PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (SPECT) ARE USEFUL FUNCTIONAL MEDICAL IMAGING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE PERFORMED TO EVALUATE BRAIN FUNCTIONS SUCH AS REGIONAL CEREBRAL PERFUSION AND NEUROTRANSMISSION. THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF RECONSTRUCTION FOR PET IS USUALLY 3-6 MM, AND FOR SPECT IS ONLY 1-2 CM. MOTIVATED BY THE LATEST ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)/MACHINE LEARNING (ML) AND ITS SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION TO MRI AND CT, IT IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE TO DEVELOP AN ML-BASED SYSTEM FOR PET/SPECT CEREBRAL IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION (ONE OF OUR SPECIFIC INTERESTS IS PARKINSON DISEASE) TO ACHIEVE HIGHER RESOLUTION AND LOWER NOISE THAN USING CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES. HOWEVER, TO DEVELOP SUCH A LEARNING SYSTEM, GROUND-TRUTH DATA (ACCURATE IMAGES, USED AS THE LABELS) THAT GUIDE THE TRAINING ARE UNAVAILABLE FROM THE THE REAL WORLD. PUBLISHED ML SYSTEMS FOR PET IMAGING HAVE USED RECONSTRUCTED IMAGES FROM CONVENTIONAL METHODS AS THE LABEL TO GUIDE THE TRAINING. AS A RESULT, THE GOAL WAS ONLY TARGETED TO IMPROVE RECONSTRUCTION SPEED, RATHER THAN IMPROVING THE IMAGE QUALITY. SINCE THE QUALITY OF RECONSTRUCTED IMAGE BY ML SYSTEM CANNOT EXCEED THE GUIDING IMAGES, THE PERFORMANCE OF ML SYSTEM CANNOT SURPASS CONVENTIONAL METHODS. THEREFORE, IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE A TWO-YEAR PROJECT THAT WILL USE CONDITIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GAN) TO GENERATE DIGITAL 2-D HUMAN BRAIN PHANTOMS, WHICH WILL BE HIGHLY SIMILAR TO REAL HUMAN BRAINS. THE GENERATED PHANTOMS WILL SERVE AS THE (PRECISE) GROUND-TRUTH DATA TO DEVELOP ML-BASED PET/SPECT RECONSTRUCTION SYSTEMS (OUR FUTURE RESEARCH). THE GENERATED PHANTOMS WILL CONTAIN AN ACTIVITY IMAGE AND AN ATTENUATION MAP. HENCE, RESULTS FROM THIS WORK CAN BE USED FOR SIMULATING BRAIN PET OR SPECT EXAMINATIONS FOR VARIOUS NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, AND NEURAL NETWORK CAN BE TRAINED WITH KNOWN GROUND TRUTH. IN ADDITION, DESIGNING ML SYSTEMS OFTEN RELIES ON LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA, BUT IT IS NOT EASY TO ACCESS DATA FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN THE US FOR SPECIFIC MEDICAL RESEARCH (MATURE ML SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FOR COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE CLASSIFICATION OFTEN INVOLVE IMAGES ON THE MILLION LEVEL FOR TRAINING). EXISTING ML SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FOR MRI, CT, AND PET IMAGING OFTEN MERELY USES A FEW TENS OF PATIENT DATA FOR TRAINING AND EVEN LESS DATA TO VALIDATE. THEREFORE, THOSE SYSTEMS ARE HIGH-LIKELY OVERFITTED TO THE DATA USED IN TRAINING. WITH THE GENERATION SYSTEM PROPOSED FROM THIS PROJECT, WE CAN PRODUCE A LARGE PHANTOM POPULATION TO AVOID THE OVERFITTING PROBLEM WHEN DESIGN THE AI IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION SYSTEM. ONCE THE GAN SYSTEM IS SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, IT CAN BE EASILY TRANSPLANTED TO PHANTOM GENERATION FOR THE AI-BASED CT AND AI-BASED MRI.

INPUTS AND AN INTERNAL BRAIN STATE. PAIN IS A UNIQUE SENSORY EXPERIENCE THAT IS TRIGGERED BY EXTERNAL SIGNALS, BUT IS ALSO STRONGLY SHAPED BY INTERNAL COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL VARIABLES. AT THE CIRCUIT LEVEL, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE PRIMARY PAIN CORTEX; INSTEAD, A DISTRIBUTED NETWORK OF CORTICAL AREAS PROCESS AND REGULATE PAIN. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX (S1) IS KNOWN TO PROCESS STIMULUS-EVOKED INFORMATION, SUCH AS LOCATION AND TIMING. THE ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX (ACC), IN CONTRAST, GIVES RISE TO THE AVERSIVE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN AND DISPLAYS A HIGH LEVEL OF NEURONAL PLASTICITY IN THE CHRONIC PAIN STATE. MEANWHILE, THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC) CAN STRONGLY MODULATE PAIN BEHAVIORS. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS WHEREBY THESE DISTRIBUTED CORTICAL PAIN CIRCUITS INTEGRATE INFORMATION REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN. THUS, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL CONCEPTUAL AND COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR PAIN AS A CONVERGING, TEMPORALLY SPECIFIC, INTERACTION AMONG THE S1, THE ACC, AND THE PFC. THIS INTERACTION CAN BE DESCRIBED BY A PREDICTIVE CODING FRAMEWORK THAT COMBINES FEEDFORWARD INPUTS WITH TOP-DOWN PREDICTIONS DEPENDENT ON PRIOR AVERSIVE EXPERIENCES, AND MODULATORY COMMANDS, BASED ON NEURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE S1, ACC AND PFC. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE WILL CREATE A NEW SET OF TOOLS FOR PAIN STUDIES. WE WILL DESIGN DEVICES TO ACCURATELY MEASURE PAIN RESPONSES; ENGINEER CLOSED-LOOP BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES (BCIS) TO SELECTIVELY PERTURB CORTICAL CIRCUITS DURING THE PRECISE TIME COURSE OF PAIN; AND DEFINE NOVEL STATISTICAL METHODS SUCH AS MECHANISTIC MEAN-FIELD MODELS TO ANALYZE DYNAMIC CORTICAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION, USING LOCAL FIELD POTENTIALS (LFPS) AND ENSEMBLE SPIKES. IN AIM 1, WE WILL IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF THE NOCICEPTIVE INFORMATION ON CENTRAL PAIN CIRCUIT DYNAMICS. WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE DIRECTED INFORMATION FLOW BETWEEN THE S1, ACC, AND PFC (MORE SPECIFICALLY THE PRELIMBIC PFC), BEFORE AND AFTER NOXIOUS STIMULATION. WE WILL CREATE CLOSED-LOOP BCIS USING A REAL-TIME PAIN DETECTION ALGORITHM BASED ON STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF SIMULTANEOUS SPIKES AND LFPS IN THE S1 AND ACC TO OPTOGENETICALLY MODULATE THE S1, AND SHOW THAT SUCH PERTURBATIONS DISRUPT THE INTEGRATION OF SIGNALS FROM THE ACC AND PFC TO IMPACT PAIN BEHAVIORS. WE WILL ALSO ANALYZE HOW CHRONIC PAIN ALTERS PREDICTIVE CODING SCHEMES AND RESPONSE TO ACUTE PAIN. IN AIM 2, WE WILL USE BCIS TO TEST THE IMPACT OF ACC MODULATION ON NEURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE S1 AND PFC, AS WELL AS ON PAIN BEHAVIORS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE WILL SHOW THAT CHRONIC PAIN CAN INDUCE MALADAPTIVE PLASTICITY IN THE ACC, WHICH IN TURN ALTERS THE INFORMATION FLOW FROM THE S1 AND PFC TO GIVE RISE TO PAIN ANTICIPATION AND TONIC PAIN \u2013 TWO EXAMPLES OF PAIN EXPERIENCE DRIVEN BY AN INTERNAL AVERSIVE STATE.

OUR SIMULATIONS WILL SHOW HOW THE CONDUCTIVITY BOUNDARIES IN IN VITRO PREPARATIONS CAN DISTORT, WEAKEN OR EVEN REVERSE THE TMS-INDUCED E-FIELD INSIDE THE TISSUE.

IN CONTRAST, OUR PROPOSED NOVEL APPROACH WILL ENABLE FABRICATION OF PHANTOMS THAT TRULY MIMIC THE CONTRAST HETEROGENEITY OF TISSUE IN 3D. THESE WILL INCLUDE PROTON DENSITY, T1, T2, T2* RELAXATION TIMES, MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY, DIFFUSION, FAT FRACTION, AIR-TISSUE FIELD- INHOMOGENEITY, RELATIVE CONDUCTIVITY, ELECTRIC PERMITTIVITY AND MAGNETIC PERMEABILITY. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT SUCH A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF MRI PARAMETERS IS ACCOMPLISHED IN A TISSUE-MIMICKING PHANTOM. BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY WORK ON QUANTITATIVE ANATOMY MIMICKING SLICE PHANTOMS, WE PROPOSE TWO APPROACHES: (A) QUANTITATIVE 3D STACK OF THIN SLICES. THIS APPROACH IS INEXPENSIVE, EASY TO REPRODUCE BY LABS WITH MODERATE EQUIPMENT AND SKILLS. (B) AN ADVANCED APPROACH OF BOUNDARYLESS FULLY 3D PHANTOMS THAT WILL BE FABRICATED VIA INKJET 3D PRINTING OF HYDROGELS AND PLASTICS AND WOULD ENABLE TRUE HIGH RESOLUTION 3D STRUCTURES WITH HETEROGENEITY THAT MIMICS HUMAN ANATOMY. IN COLLABORATION WITH LEADING INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS, WE WILL VALIDATE AND DISSEMINATE OUR TECHNOLOGY. OUR PROPOSAL IS MOTIVATED BY A RISING NEED FOR QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS IN MRI DRIVEN BY PRECISION MEDICINE AND THE USE OF DATA SCIENCE TOOLS FOR BIOMARKER DISCOVERY. WITH THE RISE OF METHODS SUCH AS FINGERPRINTING, AND ACCELERATED RECONSTRUCTION, QUANTITATIVE MRI (QMRI) IS CLOSER TO THE CLINICS THAN EVER. THE PROPOSED QUANTITATIVE MRI PHANTOM WILL MIMIC THE COMPLEXITY OF TISSUE STRUCTURE AND CONTRAST MECHANISM THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF QMRI.

THUS, DETECTION OF ACCURATE BLOOD PRESSURE IN AFRICAN AMERICANS IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS ALLEVIATING HYPERTENSION DISPARATE OUTCOMES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE AN UNOBTRUSIVE CUFFLESS BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR FOR MEASUREMENT AND IDENTIFICATION FOR MASKED HYPERTENSION IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. CURRENT STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES CUFFS IS CUMBERSOME AND DOES NOT ALLOW FOR PASSIVE/FREQUENT MEASUREMENTS. THE TRENDS FOR CUFFLESS SOLUTIONS ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY (PPG) WHICH DOES NOT OPERATE WELL ON DARKER SKIN TONES AND ON PARTICIPANTS WITH HIGHER BMIS. THIS PROJECT LEVERAGES BIOIMPEDANCE AS A SENSING MODALITY IN THE FORM OF A FINGER-WORN DEVICE, LIKE SMART RINGS. OUR DEVICE PROVIDES ROBUST AND NEARLY CONTINUOUS BIOIMPEDANCE READINGS, CORRESPONDING TO BLOOD VOLUME AND HEMODYNAMIC CHANGES, THAT WILL BE TRANSLATED TO BLOOD PRESSURE USING MACHINE LEARNING AND AI ALGORITHMS. BIOIMPEDANCE DOES NOT HAVE THE LIMITATIONS OF PPG; IT IS INSENSITIVE TO VARYING SKIN TONES AND HAS DEEP PENETRATION CAPABILITIES AND THEREFORE A HIGHER BMI (AND A THICKER LAYER OF FAT UNDER THE SKIN) DOES NOT IMPACT THE MEASUREMENTS. THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF OUR INVESTIGATION IS TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO MASKED HYPERTENSION WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF CAPTURING BLOOD PRESSURE FREQUENTLY DURING THE DAY AND AT NIGHTTIME.

CHRONIC, NON-HEALING WOUNDS ARE CURRENTLY AFFECTING MORE THAN 6 MILLION AMERICANS. THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PATIENTS\u2019 MOBILITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE, AND CAN LEAD TO A HIGH INCIDENCE OF AMPUTATION AND MORTALITY RATE. BIOFILM INFECTION IS A CRITICAL FACTOR THAT LEADS TO CHRONIC WOUND FORMATION. BIOFILM BACTERIA ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO KILL COMPARED TO PLANKTONIC BACTERIA DUE TO THEIR REDUCED GROWTH AND METABOLIC RATES, THE PRESENCE OF PERSISTER CELLS, INDUCIBLE RESISTANCE MECHANISMS IN RESPONSE TO ANTIBIOTIC CHALLENGES, AND THE MUTATIONAL RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT. CURRENT CLINICAL STANDARD OF CARE FOR CHRONIC WOUND BIOFILM INFECTIONS USES REPEATED DEBRIDEMENT WITH PROLONGED SYSTEMIC OR TOPICAL ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS. THIS TREATMENT HAS LIMITED EFFICACY AND IMPOSES A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON BOTH PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFECTIVE DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES FOR ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND PHYSICAL BIOFILM TREATMENT METHODS IS A VERY ACTIVE RESEARCH AREA. HOWEVER, CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE OFFER LIMITED IMPROVEMENT IN ANTI-BIOFILM EFFICACY, MAY CAUSE POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO HOST TISSUES, OR REQUIRE A LONG-TERM APPLICATION TO BE EFFECTIVE. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR MORE EFFICACIOUS AND SAFER BIOFILM TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE LONG-DURATION AND FREQUENT TREATMENT APPLICATIONS TO FACILITATE A TIMELY CLOSURE OF CHRONIC WOUNDS. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO APPLY ENGINEERING INNOVATIONS AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES TO PROVIDING BETTER HEALTHCARE TO CHRONIC WOUND PATIENTS. OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE IN THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A NOVEL, ELECTRIC CURRENT-BASED SYSTEM TO PROVIDE A COMPLETE TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR MULTISPECIES CHRONIC WOUND BIOFILM INFECTIONS FROM THE INITIAL REDUCTION OF BACTERIAL BIOBURDEN TO THE LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE OF WOUND STERILITY DURING THE ENTIRE COURSE OF WOUND HEALING.

THE ELECTRICAL DEBRIDEMENT AND ANTIBIOTICS WILL ACHIEVE A RAPID INITIAL REDUCTION OF BIOFILM BACTERIAL COUNT TO BELOW THE CLINICAL THRESHOLD FOR WOUND INFECTION (105 CFU/G). THE ANTIMICROBIAL NANOPARTICLES WILL THEN MAINTAIN A LOW BACTERIAL BIOBURDEN, PREVENT BIOFILM REFORMATION AND NEW INFECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WOUND HEALING PROCESS. OUR PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL BE BASED ON A NOVEL HYDROGEL IONIC CIRCUIT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN OUR LAB TO ALLOW SAFE APPLICATION OF HIGH-INTENSITY CURRENT TO WOUND TISSUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE ELECTRICAL DEBRIDEMENT EFFICACY AND IONTOPHORETIC DELIVERY EFFICIENCY FOR ANTIBIOTICS AND ANTIMICROBIAL NANOPARTICLES.

CURRENT/TRADITIONAL PERFUSION QUANTIFICATION IN MRI AND MEDICAL IMAGING IN GENERAL IS BASED ON KETY'S METHOD THAT ASSUMES THE SAME ARTERIAL INPUT GLOBALLY INTO ALL VOXELS IN AN IMAGING VOLUME. THIS GLOBAL ARTERIAL INPUT FUNCTION (AIF) TRANSGRESSES THE LOCAL MASS CONSERVATION AT A VOXEL AND REQUIRES THE USER TO CHOOSE AN ARTERIAL REGION OF INTEREST (ROI) WITH THE CONSEQUENT PERFUSION VALUE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ROI CHOICE, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE AIF PROBLEM.

THIS TOOL WILL BE BUILT BASED ON LENSLESS HIGH-THROUGHPUT CODED PTYCHOGRAPHY OPERATED AT THE 260-NM AND 280-NM DEEP ULTRAVIOLET (DUV) WAVELENGTHS. DUV LIGHT DIRECTLY INTERACTS WITH AND IS ABSORBED BY BIOMOLECULES OF NUCLEIC ACIDS (NUCLEUS) AND AMINO ACIDS (PROTEIN) OF CELLS. ABSORPTION SPECTRA ARE DIFFERENT FOR THESE TWO TYPES OF BIOMOLECULES. BY MEASURING THE SPECIMEN PROFILES AT THE 260-NM AND 280-NM DUV WAVELENGTHS, WE CAN RECOVER THE QUANTITATIVE MASS MAPS OF CELL NUCLEUS AND PROTEIN WITHOUT ANY DYE LABELING.

HOWEVER, WHEN STS ENCOMPASS OR GROW NEAR CRITICAL STRUCTURES (E.G., MAJOR NERVES, BLOOD VESSELS, AND BONES), SURGICAL RESECTION IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING AND SOMETIMES THESE CANCERS ARE DEEMED UNRESECTABLE. RADIATION, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND MINIMALLY INVASIVE OR NON-INVASIVE ABLATION METHODS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE FOR STS TREATMENT OR HAVE MAJOR DRAWBACKS, SUCH THAT THEY HAVE VERY LIMITED USE IN STS THERAPY. HISTOTRIPSY IS A NON-INVASIVE ULTRASOUND THERAPY THAT MECHANICALLY LIQUEFIES THE TARGET TISSUE TO ACELLULAR DEBRIS VIA CONTROLLED CAVITATION. HISTOTRIPSY IS WELL-SUITED FOR STS TREATMENT BECAUSE IT CAN DEBULK AND SHRINK THE TUMOR NON-INVASIVELY WHILE SPARING CRITICAL STRUCTURES, SUCH AS MAJOR VESSELS, NERVES, AND BONES. HISTOTRIPSY CAN BE USED FOR NON-INVASIVE DEBULKING OF STS TO FACILITATE OR POTENTIALLY REPLACE SURGERY. EVEN THOUGH HISTOTRIPSY HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS TUMOR TYPES, STS TREATMENT PRESENTS UNIQUE CHALLENGES. 1) STS CAN GROW SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN OTHER TYPES OF TUMORS (>10 CM OR >400ML), REQUIRING VERY FAST TREATMENT SPEED. 2) STS OFTEN GROW NEAR CRITICAL STRUCTURES AND/OR CLOSE TO THE SKIN SURFACE. TREATMENT STRATEGIES NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO AVOID DAMAGE TO CRITICAL STRUCTURES AND THE SKIN. 3) HISTOTRIPSY TREATMENT IS TYPICALLY GUIDED BY 2D B-MODE ULTRASOUND IMAGING, BUT FAST TREATMENT OF A LARGE STS REQUIRES 3D MONITORING CAPABILITIES. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL ULTRA-STEERABLE HISTOTRIPSY PHASED ARRAY SYSTEM WITH 3D CAVITATION MONITORING CAPABILITIES AND SPECIAL STRATEGIES FOR ULTRA-FAST STS ABLATION AND SAFE TREATMENT NEAR THE SKIN SURFACE AND CRITICAL STRUCTURES. WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1: TO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT AN INTEGRATED HISTOTRIPSY STS SYSTEM, CONSISTING OF AN ULTRA-STEERABLE HISTOTRIPSY PHASED ARRAY WITH TRANSMIT-RECEIVE CAPABILITY FOR 3D CAVITATION MONITORING, ULTRASOUND IMAGE GUIDANCE, ROBOTIC ARM ASSISTANCE, AND ACOUSTIC COUPLING. AIM 2: TO OPTIMIZE HISTOTRIPSY PARAMETERS FOR FAST (>10 ML/MIN) AND SAFE TREATMENT NEAR THE SKIN SURFACE AND CRITICAL STRUCTURES AND TEST IN EX VIVO TISSUE AND EXCISED HUMAN AND CANINE STS SAMPLES OF DIFFERENT HISTOLOGICAL SUBTYPES. AIM 3: TO TEST THE IN VIVO SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE INTEGRATED HISTOTRIPSY STS SYSTEM (AIM 1) AND OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS FOR FAST AND SAFE TREATMENT NEAR THE SKIN AND CRITICAL STRUCTURES (AIM 2) IN CANINE STS PATIENTS AT THE VIRGINIA TECH ANIMAL CANCER CARE AND RESEARCH CENTER. THIS PROJECT WILL RESULT IN A HUMAN PROTOTYPE HISTOTRIPSY SYSTEM WITH UNIQUE TREATMENT AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES AS WELL AS PARAMETERS OPTIMIZED FOR STS THERAPY.

HISTORICALLY, STAGE II AND III TUMORS, ALSO KNOWN AS LOCALLY ADVANCED RECTAL CANCERS (LARC), HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH SURGICAL RESECTION, RADIATION, AND CHEMOTHERAPY. HOWEVER, ADVANCES IN NEOADJUVANT (PREOPERATIVE) TREATMENT NOW ENABLE UP TO 35% OF PATIENTS TO ACHIEVE COMPLETE TUMOR DEATH, OR COMPLETE RESPONSE, WITH RADIATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY ALONE. IN THESE INDIVIDUALS, SURGICAL RESECTION HAS SHOWN NO BENEFIT AND CARRIES THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF MAJOR COMPLICATIONS, PROLONGED RECOVERY, AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, STANDARD CLINICAL TESTING AND RADIOGRAPHIC AND ENDOSCOPIC IMAGING MODALITIES POORLY DIFFERENTIATE POST-TREATMENT SCARS FROM THE RESIDUAL TUMOR. CONFOUNDED BY POST-TREATMENT FIBROTIC REACTION AND EDEMA, THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY COMPLETE RESPONDERS BEFORE SURGERY. DUE TO THIS TECHNOLOGICAL GAP, SURGICAL RESECTION REMAINS THE STANDARD OF CARE (SOC) FOR ALL PATIENTS OUTSIDE OF SPECIALIZED TERTIARY CARE CENTERS. WITH IMPROVED IMAGING MODALITIES, WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT WOULD REDUCE TREATMENT MORBIDITY FOR THOUSANDS OF RECTAL CANCER PATIENTS ANNUALLY.

THE PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED IN CHILDREN, FOR WHOM MR- CONDITIONAL DEVICES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, LEAVING THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION UNABLE TO RECEIVE THE STANDARD OF CARE THAT THEY NEED THE MOST, AND EXCLUDING THEM FROM SCIENTIFIC INQUIRIES WHEN THEY ARE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS. THE MAJOR RISK OF MRI IN PATIENTS WITH CONDUCTIVE IMPLANTS IS THE RF HEATING OF THE TISSUE DUE TO THE ANTENNA EFFECT. THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE ELECTRIC FIELD OF MRI SCANNER COUPLES WITH THE IMPLANTED DEVICE AND AMPLIFIES THE SPECIFIC ABSORPTION RATE (SAR) OF THE RADIOFREQUENCY ENERGY IN THE TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT. MR-CONDITIONAL IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ADULTS, ALLOWING PATIENTS TO RECEIVE MRI UNDER RESTRICTED CONDITIONS THAT ASSURE SAFETY. REGRETTABLY, HOWEVER, NEITHER MRI VENDORS NOR DEVICE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ESTABLISHED SAFE MRI METHODOLOGIES FOR CHILDREN WITH CONDUCTIVE IMPLANTS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP, VALIDATE, AND DEPLOY A NOVEL MULTI-PLATFORM MRI COIL TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS ULTRA-FAST AND HIGH-RESOLUTION MRI TO BE SAFELY PERFORMED IN CHILDREN WITH CONDUCTIVE IMPLANTS REGARDLESS OF THE IMPLANT LOCATION IN THEIR BODIES. OUR SOLUTION IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT THROUGH INNOVATIVE ENGINEERING WE CAN CONTROL LOCAL ELECTRIC FIELDS GENERATED BY MRI ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, THUS AVOIDING INTERACTIONS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL'S IMPLANTED DEVICE WHEREVER IT HAPPENS TO BE IN THE BODY. OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS TECHNIQUE CAN ACHIEVE A 20- FOLD REDUCTION IN RF HEATING OF CARDIAC IMPLANTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES (CEIDS), AS WELL AS IMPLANTS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) SUCH AS ECOG ELECTRODES AND VAGUS NERVE STIMULATION (VNS) DEVICES.

THIS RESEARCH IS MOTIVATED BY THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF AF IN US (1 IN 100 PEOPLE), AND THE SUBOPTIMAL TREATMENT OUTCOME OF TRADITIONAL APPROACHES (~30- 50% RECURRENCE RATE). RECURRENCE OF AF OCCURS WHEN THERE ARE GAPS BETWEEN ABLATION LESIONS, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY MULTIPLE REASONS, INCLUDING 1) LIMITED ABILITY TO MANIPULATE THE CATHETER IN A MANNER THAT REACHES ALL DESIRED ABLATION TARGETS WHILE ALSO 2) MAINTAINING PROPER CATHETER-TISSUE CONTACT FORCE (CTCF) FOR EFFECTIVE ABLATION ENERGY DELIVERY. IN ADDITION, THERE IS 3) LACK OF EFFECTIVE NAVIGATION METHODS THAT ACCURATELY IDENTIFY SITES OF INCOMPLETE ABLATION AND GUIDE THE CATHETER TO COMPLETE ABLATION.

THIS FLAP-THREATENING EVENT OCCURS IN 6-14% OF CASES, AND IF UNTREATED FLAP NECROSIS AND RECONSTRUCTIVE FAILURE ARE INEVITABLE. THE MOST COMMON FLAP MONITORING STRATEGIES IS SERIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND EXTERNAL DOPPLER EXAMINATION. HOWEVER, THESE STRARTEGIES ARE LIMITED BY ITS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE NATURE AND THE REQUIREMENT FOR SKILLED BEDSIDE PERSONNEL TO CHECK THE FLAP FREQUENTLY. AND THE INTERMITTENT ASSESSMENT IS SUBJECT TO DELAY IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF MALPERFUSION, SINCE CLEAR SIGNS OF MALPERFUSION MAY TAKE SEVERAL HOURS TO BECOME OBVIOUS. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN WEARABLE ELECTRONIC SENSORS WITH BUILT-IN SYSTEMS ON CHIP ENABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR REAL-TIME MONITORING OF PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF TARGETED TISSUES. HOWEVER, WEARABLE BIOSENSORS THAT FEATURE SKIN-INTERFACE POSE A CHALLENGE: TO SENSE PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS OXYGENATION OF TISSUE MICROENVIRONMENTS AT DEPTH. IN THE CASE OF FLAP MONITORING, EXISTING DEVICES SUCH AS VIOPTIX ARE ONLY ABLE TO MONITOR FLAPS WHICH BEAR A CUTANEOUS SKIN.

THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO CREATE CLINIC-READY STRAINS THAT WILL EFFICIENTLY LOCAL- IZE AND RELEASE HIGH-DOSES OF THERAPEUTICS, WHILE MAINTAINING SAFETY FOR PATIENTS.  TO DO SO, THE ACCOMPANYING PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON ENGINEERING GENETICALLY ENCODED ENCAPSULATION SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE INTRAVENOUS (IV) DELIVERY OF THERAPEUTIC BACTERIA FOR BREAST CANCER THERAPY.

CURRENT DIAGNOSTICS FOR NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES ARE INFEASIBLE AT THE REQUIRED POPULATION SCALE DUE TO COST AND LOGISTICAL CONSTRAINTS, AND SO A POINT-OF-CARE, MINIMAL-EQUIPMENT, FIELD-DEPLOYABLE APPROACH IS NEEDED TO HELP NUTRITIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGISTS GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO BETTER ALLOCATE LIMITED INTERVENTION RESOURCES.

THUS, THE SAME TECHNOLOGY COULD BE TRANSLATED TO GLOBAL HEALTH APPLICATIONS AND SCREENING FOR OTHER DISEASES IN RESOURCE-POOR LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, IT COULD ALSO ENABLE BETTER DIAGNOSTIC MONITORING FOR NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT PATIENTS BY OVERCOMING LIMITATIONS ON DAILY ALLOWABLE BLOOD DRAW VOLUMES.

TRADITIONAL MANUAL BRONCHOSCOPES ARE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS SMALL BRONCHI BECAUSE OF LARGE DIAMETERS. ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPES AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET ARE EASIER AND MORE INTUITIVE TO MANEUVER. HOWEVER, THEY STILL PRESENT DISTAL DEXTERITY LIMITATIONS AND DEEP EXPLORATION IS STILL PERFORMED WITHOUT VISUALIZATION BY USING SEMI-FLEXIBLE NEEDLES THAT ARE PUSHED MANUALLY BY THE CLINICIAN. THIS AFFECTS BIOPSY ACCURACY AND PRECISION AND ULTIMATELY DIAGNOSTIC YIELD, CAUSING DELAYS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT AND INCREASING THE RISK FOR TUMOR GROWTH AND SPREAD. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL LEVERAGE OUR PRIOR PIONEERING WORK ON THE DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND PRELIMINARY VALIDATION OF A MINIATURIZED SOFT ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPE FOR EARLY-STAGE LUNG CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. THIS AIR-POWERED, IMAGE-GUIDED ROBOT IS THE SMALLEST AND MOST FLEXIBLE AND DEXTEROUS ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPE, ALLOWING NAVIGATION IN BRANCHES DEEPER IN THE LUNG AND VISUAL FEEDBACK THROUGHOUT THE PROCEDURE. THE SYSTEM FEATURES TWO SEPARATE WORKING CHANNELS TO FACILITATE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, SIMULTANEOUS (I.E., WITHIN THE SAME BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE) DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC CAPABILITIES AND HASTEN EARLY-STAGE LUNG CANCER TREATMENT. WE WILL OPTIMIZE THE SOFT ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPE NAVIGATION AND STABILIZATION CONTROL BASED ON COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS. WE WILL MERGE PRE-OPERATIVE PLANNING AND INTRA-OPERATIVE DATA AND EVALUATE ACCURACY AND PRECISION IN REGISTRATION. WE WILL DEVELOP A MECHANICAL STABILIZATION SYSTEM AT THE ROBOT TIP, THAT WILL ANCHOR TO THE SURROUNDING ANATOMY AND WORK IN CONCERT WITH SOFTWARE STABILIZATION. THIS WILL ENHANCE ROBOT LESION TRACKING ABILITIES DURING BREATHING AND OTHER INVOLUNTARY OR ACCIDENTAL MOVEMENTS AND COUNTERACT TISSUE REACTION FORCES DURING BIOPSY TO IMPROVE SURGICAL TASKS\u2019 ACCURACY AND PRECISION. WE WILL ENABLE ROBOTIC ACTUATION CONTROL FOR NEEDLE TOOL DEPLOYMENT AND STEERING VIA MULTI-DOF SOFT ROBOTIC MICRO ACTUATORS AT THE ROBOT TIP.

EACH YEAR THESE DISEASES AFFECT NEARLY 1 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE US. STROKE ALONE KILLS MORE THAN 130,000 AMERICANS EACH YEAR. EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF THESE DISEASES REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING THE CEREBROVASCULAR ARCHITECTURE, WHICH IS COMPLEX AND PATIENT SPECIFIC. EXISTING CLINICALLY AVAILABLE METHODS FOR IMAGING BLOOD VESSELS IN THE BRAIN ARE LIMITED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION, THE NEED FOR IONIZING RADIATION OR CONTRAST AGENTS, AND THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF SOME TYPES OF IMAGING DURING SURGICAL PROCEDURES.

HOWEVER, PREMADE CA SCAFFOLDS WITH DEFINED SIZES, SHAPES, AND PORE PROPERTIES PRESENT CHALLENGES IN ADAPTING TO COMPLEX BONE DEFECTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RELATIVELY SLOW DEGRADATION RATE OF CELLULOSE/CA CAN LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO CONTROL FACTOR RELEASE AND HEAL BONE. COMBINING CA WITH CA PHTHALATE (CAP) AND NANOCLAY (NC) HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE WEAKNESSES.

WORLDWIDE, ONLY 21% OF HCV-INFECTED PEOPLE ARE DIAGNOSED. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES (AI/AN) WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECTED WITH NEW HCV INFECTION RATE OF 2.9 CASES/100,000 AS COMPARED TO 0.5 CASES/100,000 IN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND 1.2 CASES/100,000 IN NON- HISPANIC WHITES WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MORTALITY RATES COMPARED TO NON-AI/AN ETHNIC AND RACIAL GROUPS. THE TWO-STEP HCV TESTING PROCESS OF HCV ANTIBODY TESTING FOLLOWED BY CONFIRMATORY HCV RNA TESTING IS EXPENSIVE, TIME-CONSUMING, AND SUBOPTIMAL, WHICH HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT DROP OUT OF HCV-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS FROM THE CASCADE OF HCV MANAGEMENT BEFORE RECEIVING CARE. THE HCV ANTIBODY TESTING CANNOT BE USED FOR DETECTING ACTIVE INFECTION DUE TO ITS INABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN RESOLVED HCV (R-HCV) AND VIREMIC HCV (V- HCV). THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE HCV RNA TESTING ASSAYS INCLUDING THE POC HCV RNA ASSAYS ARE STILL LAB-BASED AND EXPENSIVE AND MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN MOST RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS AND THOSE WITH HCV-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES INCLUDING AIS/ANS. LOW-COST, RAPID, SENSITIVE, AND SPECIFIC POC HCV ANTIGEN TESTING IS AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH THAT HOLDS GREAT PROMISE FOR ONE-STEP HCV SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AND FDA-APPROVED POC HCV AG TESTING DEVICE. THE ALREADY DEVELOPED HCV AG ASSAYS ARE LAB-BASED, RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY NOT SENSITIVE/SPECIFIC ENOUGH PARTICULARLY WHEN TESTED WITH SAMPLES WITH CLINICALLY RELEVANT LOW VIRAL LOADS (<1000 IU/ML), WHICH HAS LIMITED THEIR CLINICAL UTILITIES. THE ABBOTT ARCHITECT HCVCAG ASSAY HAD A SENSITIVITY OF 64.7%-81.9% WHEN TESTED WITH HCV SERUM SAMPLES WITH <104 IU/ML VIRAL LOADS AND 0.0%-19.7% WHEN TESTED WITH HCV SERUM SAMPLES WITH <1000 IU/ML VIRAL LOADS. THEREFORE, TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HCV CARE PARTICULARLY THOSE DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECTED SUCH AS AIS/ANS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR INEXPENSIVE, RAPID, SENSITIVE, AND SPECIFIC POC HCV AG DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT IS DEVELOPING A SMARTPHONE-BASED DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM FOR RAPID (<30 MINUTES) AND SENSITIVE (LOD OF 200 IU/ML TO 1000 IU/ML) HCV DETECTION USING FINGERPRICK VOLUME (<100 \u039cL) OF A WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLE PLACED ON AN INEXPENSIVE (<$2 MATERIAL COST), DISPOSABLE, AND MASS- PRODUCIBLE MICROFLUIDIC-BASED CARTRIDGE.

AS A RESULT, FDG-PET IS NOT FREQUENTLY USED IN THESE PATIENTS. THAT LEAVES BRAIN TUMOR PATIENTS WITHOUT THE BENEFITS OF METABOLIC IMAGING, WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR DISEASE.  THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED MRI-BASED METHOD, DEUTERIUM METABOLIC IMAGING (DMI) CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY TO DETECT ABNORMAL GLUCOSE METABOLISM.

THE GOAL OF THIS REVISED R01 RENEWAL APPLICATION IS TO DEVELOP A NEW SEQUENTIAL TARGETING IN CROSSLINKING (STICK) NANO-DELIVERY PLATFORM TO IMPROVE THE DRUG DELIVERY TO BRAIN MALIGNANCIES. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPOSED STICK NANOPARTICLE (STICK NP) ALLOW IT TO OVERCOME THE MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO PENETRATE DEEPLY IN BRAIN MALIGNANCIES. IN AIM1, WE WILL ENGINEER NEW STICK NPS BY DESIGNING NEW TYPES OF BORONATE CROSSLINKAGES TO IMPROVE THEIR CNS PK TO MAXIMIZE THE TIME WINDOW TO ENHANCE THE GLUCOSE TRANSPORTER (GLUT1)-MEDIATED TRANSCYTOSIS ACROSS THE BBB/BBTB. THE NEW CROSSLINKAGES ALSO ENHANCE THE PH-RESPONSIVE SIZE TRANSFORMATION FOR IMPROVED TUMOR TISSUE PENETRATION AND SIALIC ACID-TARGETING SELECTIVITY FOR ENHANCED TUMOR CELL SPECIFICITY. OUR PREVIOUS R01 GRANT FOCUSED ON LOW GRADE BRAIN TUMORS AND AS A LOGICAL BUT DISTINCTIVE EXTENSION IN THIS RESEARCH TOPIC, THE TARGET OF OUR CURRENT PROJECT IS DIFFUSE MIDLINE GLIOMA (DMG, PREVIOUSLY CALLED DIFFUSE INTRINSIC PONTINE GLIOMA (DIPG)), A HIGH GRADE AND THE MOST AGGRESSIVE FORM OF PEDIATRIC GLIOMA. DMG IS THE SECOND MOST COMMON TYPE OF PRIMARY, HIGH GRADE BRAIN TUMOR OCCURRING IN CHILDREN WITH A MEDIAN SURVIVAL <1 YEAR FROM DIAGNOSIS AND THE FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE OF DMG IS ONLY AROUND 2%. DISCOVERY OF THE CHARACTERISTIC HISTONE 3-LYSINE- 27-METHIONINE (H3K27M) MUTATION OFFERS OPPORTUNITY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF TARGETED EPIGENETIC THERAPIES FOR THIS DEADLY DISEASE. IN AIM2, WE WILL QUANTITATIVELY DETERMINE THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEWLY ENGINEERED STICK NPS IN ORTHOTOPIC DMG PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFT (PDX) MODELS AND ELUCIDATE THEIR DELIVERY MECHANISMS BY OPTICAL IMAGING, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING, LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (LC- MS), AND A SERIES OF BIOPHYSICAL APPROACHES. IN AIM3, TWO PROMISING EPIGENETIC DRUGS (PANOBINOSTAT AND ONC201) WILL BE SPECIFICALLY DELIVERED TO DMG BY ENCAPSULATIONS WITHIN SELECTED STICK NPS FOR EPIGENETIC THERAPY. THE EFFICACY, TOXICITY, AND MOLECULAR RESPONSES IN TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT WILL BE INVESTIGATED IN ORTHOTOPIC PDX MODELS AND GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MURINE (GEM) DMG MODELS. THIS PROJECT HAS THE GREAT POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF DMG TREATMENT.

SERUM BIOMARKER MEASURE- MENTS ARE WIDELY USED AS DIAGNOSTIC INDICATORS, BUT MANY MARKERS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ASSESSMENTS OF DISEASE STATE. MAJOR FACTORS LIMITING DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING USING MOST BIOMARKERS INCLUDE THEIR LOW SPECIFICITY FOR DIS- EASES AND THE OVERALL DEARTH OF ESTABLISHED MOLECULAR MARKERS. INNOVATIVE APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY NEW BIOMARKERS AND/OR IMPROVE SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC EFFORTS IN THE ABSENCE OF VALIDATED BIOMARKERS.

WITH SUFFICIENT DIVERSITY, THE SENSORS CAN DIFFERENTIATE BI- OFLUIDS BY DISEASE STATUS WITH THE AID OF MACHINE LEARNING PROCESSES. IN PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS, WE FOUND THAT A LIBRARY OF OCC-DNA NANOSENSORS EXHIBITED SENSITIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED SPECTRAL VARIATION TO PROBE AN ENSEMBLE OF MOLECULAR BINDING EVENTS. VIA MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, WE BUILT A PREDICTION MODEL OF NANOSENSOR RE- SPONSES THAT RELIABLY IDENTIFIED HIGH-GRADE SEROUS OVARIAN CANCER (HGSC) SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER THAN THE ESTAB- LISHED, FDA-APPROVED BIOMARKER, CA125, USING AN INITIAL SET OF 264 PATIENT SERUM SAMPLES (NAT BIOMED ENG, 2022). DESPITE ADVANCES IN THE UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGEMENT OF HGSC, SURVIVAL IS CURRENTLY POOR WHEN DIAG- NOSED AT LATER STAGES, AND DETECTION IS UNCOMMON AT EARLY STAGES. SURGERY IS THE FIRST-LINE TREATMENT, AND CANCER RECURS IN 70% OF PATIENTS IN REMISSION. SECONDARY SURGERY CAN PROLONG SURVIVAL BUT ONLY IF PERFORMED EARLY ENOUGH TO ENABLE COMPLETE RESECTION. IMPROVED DETECTION OF EARLY-RECURRENT AND EARLY-STAGE HGSC WOULD THEREFORE MARKEDLY INCREASE SURVIVAL RATES.

THE CURRENT STANDARD TREATMENT FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED GLIOMAS INCLUDES MAXIMAL SURGICAL RESECTION, RADIATION THERAPY (RT), AND CHEMOTHERAPY. A KEY TECHNICAL CHALLENGE IN RT TREATMENT PLANNING IS ACCURATE TARGET VOLUME DELINEATION OF GLIOMAS. THE CURRENT CLINICAL GUIDELINES FOR TARGET VOLUME DELINEATION RELY PRIMARILY ON STRUCTURAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) IMAGES. GROSS TUMOR VOLUME (GTV) IS DEFINED BASED ON CONTRAST-ENHANCED T1-WEIGHTED MRI AND T2-WEIGHTED MRI. HOWEVER, STRUCTURAL MRI ALONE LACKS SPECIFICITY FOR DELINEATION OF TRUE TUMOR BOUNDARIES. ACCORDINGLY, CLINICAL TARGET VOLUME (CTV) IS OFTEN DEFINED AS THE GTV PLUS A LARGE MARGIN (E.G., 20-25 MM) TO ACCOUNT FOR POSSIBLE MICROSCOPIC INFILTRATION. THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY OF STRUCTURAL MRI IS A CRITICAL FACTOR LIMITING THE INVESTIGATION AND CLINICAL APPLICATION OF NEW RT TECHNIQUES FOR BETTER CLINICAL OUTCOME. MR SPECTROSCOPIC IMAGING (MRSI) HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL TOOL FOR LABEL-FREE MOLECULAR IMAGING OF BRAIN TUMOR. IN A RECENT PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL, MRSI IS USED TO GUIDE DOSE ESCALATION IN RT FOR GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME PATIENTS, SHOWING VERY PROMISING PRELIMINARY RESULTS. ALTHOUGH GENERAL CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MRSI HAVE BEEN IMPEDED BY ITS LIMITED SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND LONG SCAN TIME, SIGNIFICANT PROGRESSES HAVE BEEN MADE IN ADDRESSING THESE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES OVER THE PAST DECADE USING ADVANCED DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING METHODS. OUR GROUP HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED A POWERFUL MRSI TECHNOLOGY, KNOWN AS SPICE (SPECTROSCOPIC IMAGING BY EXPLOITING SPATIOSPECTRAL CORRELATION). SPICE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATES RAPID SCANNING, SPARSE SAMPLING, QUANTUM SIMULATION OF MOLECULE RESONANCE STRUCTURES, AND MACHINE LEARNING TO ENABLE RAPID HIGH-RESOLUTION MRSI. PRELIMINARY RESULTS BY OUR AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE SHOWN AN EXCITING POTENTIAL OF SPICE TO ACHIEVE AN UNPRECEDENTED COMBINATION OF RESOLUTION, SPEED, AND SNR FOR METABOLIC IMAGING.

NORMALLY FOR POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET), TOF INFORMATION IS USED AS A WEIGHTING KERNEL DURING IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION AND RESULTS IN AN EFFECTIVE SENSITIVITY GAIN THAT CAN BE USED TO REDUCE RADIATION DOSE, IMPROVE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO, OR REDUCE SCAN DURATION. THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE BENEFITS DEPEND ON THE TOF RESOLUTION, WHICH IS GOVERNED BY THE TIMING PERFORMANCE OF THE DETECTORS. CURRENT STATE OF THE ART FOR PET SCANNERS IS ~220 PS WHICH CORRESPONDS TO A LOCALIZATION OF ~3.3 CM. A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE WOULD OCCUR, HOWEVER, IF A TOF RESOLUTION OF <30 PS COULD BE ACHIEVED. THIS WOULD LOCALIZE EVENTS WITHIN 4.5 MM, ALLOWING IMAGES TO BE DIRECTLY GENERATED WITHOUT A RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM AT A SPATIAL RESOLUTION THAT MATCHES WHAT IS ACHIEVED IN CLINICAL PET SCANNERS TODAY. WE REFER TO THIS AS DIRECT POSITRON EMISSION IMAGING (PEI). WITH THIS SUPERB TOF RESOLUTION AND RECONSTRUCTION-FREE IMAGING, WE ENTER A NEW REGIME WHERE WE EXPECT MAJOR INCREASES IN IMAGE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE, BOTH DUE TO THE ADDITIONAL TOF INFORMATION, AND THE REMOVAL OF NOISE AMPLIFICATION INHERENT IN RECONSTRUCTING NOISY DATA WITH NOISY CORRECTIONS FROM PROJECTION DATA.

IDENTIFICATION OF CAC IS CLINICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS USED FOR CARDIOVASCULAR RISK AND THERAPY DECISION MAKING. CURRENTLY, CAC IS QUANTIFIED BY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT), HOWEVER, CT-BASED POPULATION SCREENING IS NOT WIDELY UTILIZED DUE TO COST AND RADIATION BURDEN.

ALL DATA ACQUIRED BY THE WEARABLE ULTRASONIC DEVICE WILL BE WIRELESSLY TRANSMITTED TO A TERMINAL RECEIVER (E.G., A SMARTPHONE), WHERE A DEEP LEARNING BASED ALGORITHM IS RUNNING FOR FURTHER DATA PROCESSING. THE CUSTOMIZED ALGORITHM WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOCALIZE THE TARGETED ARTERY AND TRACK BOTH THE ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR WALLS OF THE VESSEL WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF HUMAN OPERATORS.

TRAUMA CARE NEEDS THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES AND DATA COLLECTION TO EXAMINE THE INJURY OF PATIENT IN COMPLICATED ENVIRONMENTS, SUCH AS OUTSIDE THE HOSPITALS OR IMAGING-CENTERS. PORTABLE MEDICAL IMAGING DEVICES SUCH AS X- RAY IMAGING DEVICES ARE NOTABLY CRITICAL TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS. SINCE ALMOST ALL PRESENT X-RAY DETECTORS ARE MADE OF THE COMBINATION OF SCINTILLATORS WITH PHOTODETECTOR ARRAYS, THE PORTABILITY OF X-RAY DETECTORS IS LIMITED BY THE RIGID CERAMIC SCINTILLATORS. EXPOSURE TO IONIZING RADIATION IS KNOWN TO INCREASE THE RISK OF CANCER DUE TO THE DAMAGING OF DNA BY X-RAY. THE CURRENT DETECTORS ARE NOT SENSITIVE ENOUGH SO THAT A LARGE DOSE IS NEED TO ACHIEVE ENOUGH SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO IN IMAGING. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO YIELD A NEW GENERATION OF X-RAY DETECTORS THAT ARE FOLDABLE, SENSITIVE BY OVERCOMING THE LIMITATION OF STATE-OF-THE-ART DETECTORS USING METAL HALIDE PEROVSKITES TO DIRECTLY CONVERT X-RAY INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNAL. DIRECT CONVERSION DETECTORS HAVE BETTER RESOLUTION THAN INDIRECTION ONES, BECAUSE IT DOESNOT HAVE THE ISSUE OF NONDIRECTIONAL LIGHT EMISSION IN SCINTILLATORS.

A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN PET IMAGING OF FLOW-METABOLISM IS THAT SCANNING FOR THESE TWO PROCESSES REQUIRES TWO DIFFERENT RADIOTRACERS\u201318F-FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE (FDG) FOR METABOLISM AND A SECOND FLOW RADIOTRACER FOR PERFUSION IMAGING. WHILE FDG IS WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE CLINIC FOR METABOLIC IMAGING, PERFUSION IMAGING BY PET IS CLINICALLY LIMITED, RESULTING IN UNDERUTILIZATION OF FLOW-METABOLISM IMAGING IN BOTH RESEARCH AND CLINICS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A SINGLE-TRACER MULTIPARAMETRIC PET IMAGING SOLUTION FOR SIMULTANEOUS FLOW- METABOLISM IMAGING USING ONLY 18F-FDG WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A SECOND FLOW-SPECIFIC RADIOTRACER.

FOCUS SCANNING ALLOWS FOR CONVENIENT SELECTION OF A PROPER LAYER OR POPULATION OF NEURONS. THE TUNABLE LENS CAN CREATE A CURVED REFRACTIVE INDEX PROFILE WHEN APPLIED WITH A LOW-VOLTAGE (<10 V, SAFE) ELECTRICAL DRIVE. COMPARED WITH OTHER TUNABLE LENSES, THE TUNABLE LENS WILL BE EXTREMELY COMPACT AND LIGHT, CRITICAL FOR IMAGING FREELY-MOVING RODENTS.

SOCIAL BEHAVIOR INVOLVES SENSORY, COGNITIVE, AND MOTOR FUNCTIONS AND THUS DEPENDS ON THE INTERACTIONS OF MANY NEURONS, BUT UNTIL NOW NO TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE TO RECORD FROM A LARGE POPULATION OF NEURONS WITH SUBCELLULAR RESOLUTION OVER MULTIPLE INTERCONNECTED REGIONS IN FREELY-BEHAVING MICE. HERE WE CHOOSE TO STUDY THE DYNAMIC NEURAL CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX (M1) AND A CRITICAL SENSORY INFORMATION ROUTING NODE, PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY (PAG). BOTH AREAS ARE CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOR, BUT HOW THESE INTERCONNECTED REGIONS SYNERGIZE TO PROCESS INFORMATION REMAINS ALMOST COMPLETELY UNKNOWN.

HOWEVER, ALL FMRI METHODS MEASURE NEURONAL ACTIVITY INDIRECTLY BY TRACKING THE ASSOCIATED LOCAL CHANGES IN BLOOD FLOW, VOLUME AND OXYGENATION, WHICH LIMIT THEIR SPATIOTEMPORAL SPECIFICITY TO THE UNDERLYING NEURONAL ACTIVITY. WHILE THIS IS OFTEN VIEWED AS THE FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION OF FMRI, RECENT OPTICAL IMAGING STUDIES IN ANIMAL MODELS HAVE SHOWN A TIGHT COUPLING BETWEEN MICROVASCULAR DIAMETER CHANGES AND NEURAL ACTIVITY. THESE DATA INDICATE THAT HUMAN FMRI\u2014 AS IT IS PERFORMED TODAY\u2014HAS VAST UNTAPPED POTENTIAL THAT CAN ONLY BE REAPED IF OUR MEASUREMENTS CAN BE MADE SENSITIVE EXCLUSIVELY TO CHANGES IN THESE SMALLEST BLOOD VESSELS.

THE SAME SYSTEM WITH NO CHANGE IN ELECTRODE PLACEMENT COULD BE USED TO MONITOR FOR INADVERTENT EXTUBATION AND FOR THE ONSET OF EMERGENCY CONDITIONS SUCH AS PNEUMOTHORAX. EIT IS A NONINVASIVE, NON-IONIZING FUNCTIONAL IMAGING TECHNIQUE IN WHICH IMAGES ARE FORMED FROM VOLTAGES MEASURED ON ELECTRODES ON THE BODY ARISING FROM IMPERCEPTIBLE APPLIED CURRENTS. SINCE EIT IS A SAFE AND PORTABLE TECHNOLOGY WITH NO DAMAGING SIDE EFFECTS, IT CAN BE USED BOTH FOR CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND AS NEEDED. OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM FROM GE RESEARCH, COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY, AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY WILL DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE SPECIALIZED SMS-EIT SYSTEM THROUGH THREE SPECIFIC AIMS.

TREATMENT USUALLY INVOLVES SYSTEMIC THERAPY BEFORE SURGERY. COMPLETE RESPONSE TO NEOADJUVANT SYSTEMIC THERAPY (NST) WITH NORMALIZATION OF THE LYMPH NODES TRANSLATES TO LESS EXTENSIVE SURGERY, LOWER RELATED MORBIDITY, AND SOMETIMES LESS INTENSE RADIATION THERAPY. TO MARK A POSITIVE LYMPH NODE, A BIOPSY MARKER IS PLACED IN THE POSITIVE NODE PRE-NST. POST-NST, THE MARKED NODE IS IDENTIFIED WITH ULTRASOUND, MAMMOGRAPHY, OR COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY TO IMPLANT A LOCALIZER, WHICH THE SURGEON USES FOR NODE REMOVAL. ULTRASOUND IS THE FIRST- LINE IMAGING MODALITY FOR THIS TASK. STILL, THE MARKER CANNOT BE FOUND SONOGRAPHICALLY IN ~25% OF CASES, RESULTING IN SUBOPTIMAL OR ABORTED LOCALIZATIONS, DELAYS TO SURGERY, LONGER PROCEDURAL TIMES, INCREASED PATIENT DISCOMFORT OR INCONVENIENCE, AND INCREASED ABSORBED COSTS BY THE CLINICAL PRACTICE. ERRORS IN IDENTIFYING THE PROPER NODE(S) MAY LEAD TO FALSE-NEGATIVE RESULTS, OVER/UNDERTREATMENT, AND POTENTIAL CANCER RECURRENCE. MARKER MIGRATION REMAINS ANOTHER CONCERN THAT CAN LEAD TO MISGUIDED LOCALIZATION, DIRECTING THE SURGEON TO THE INCORRECT NODE. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE UNMET AND CRITICAL NEEDS TO DEVELOP RELIABLE, READILY ULTRASOUND-CONSPICUOUS MARKERS THAT ARE ALSO RESISTANT TO MIGRATION. METHODS: OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT PHYSICAL FEATURES OF MARKERS, LIKE SURFACE ROUGHNESS, CAN CAUSE AN ULTRASOUND TWINKLING ARTIFACT OR \u201cTWINKLING SIGNATURE\u201d CLASSICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH KIDNEY STONES USING COLOR DOPPLER FLOW IMAGING. WITH THE COLLECTIVE EXPERTISE OF A DIVERSE RESEARCH TEAM, WE HAVE DEVELOPED MARKERS USING POLYMETHYL METHACRYLATE AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (THREE-DIMENSIONAL PRINTING). THESE MARKERS GENERATE ROBUST TWINKLING SIGNATURES WITH ULTRASOUND, ARE VISIBLE WITH MULTIPLE IMAGING MODALITIES, AND ARE RESISTANT TO MARKER MIGRATION. WE WILL TEST THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF THESE MARKERS IN A PORCINE MODEL OVER A SIX-MONTH PERIOD TO MIMIC THE DURATION OF NST TREATMENT WITH CHEMOTHERAPY. LASTLY, WE WILL CONDUCT A PHASE 1 CLINICAL TRIAL IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH OUR OPTIMIZED MARKER TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM STRENGTH OF THE TWINKLING SIGNATURE AND THE DEGREE OF MARKER MIGRATION.

A THOROUGH CHARACTERIZATION OF A PATIENT\u2019S TUMOR UPFRONT PROVIDES BETTER OUTCOMES, I.E., BETTER INSIGHT AFFORDS HIGHER SURVIVAL RATES. IN CONTRAST AND ALMOST ANACHRONISTICALLY, PET IMAGING (THE MOST SENSITIVE AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING METHOD) IS \u201cMONOCHROMATIC\u201d AS IT CAN ONLY ASSESS ONE PARAMETER AT THE TIME, LACKING DEPTH OF INFORMATION. SUITABLE IMAGING TOOLS THAT ALLOW VISUALIZATION OF MORE THAN ONE TARGET IN PATIENTS ARE NEEDED, AKIN AN IN VIVO CYTOMETRY. OPTICAL IMAGING UTILIZES MULTIPLE PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM TO VISUALIZE SEVERAL TARGETS SIMULTANEOUSLY, BUT THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE FOR WHOLE-BODY CLINICAL IMAGING DUE TO THE LIMITED PENETRATION OF LIGHT. SINGLE-PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (SPECT) CAN DISTINGUISH SEVERAL ISOTOPES BASED ON THE ENERGY OF THEIR EMISSIONS, BUT SPECTRA OFTEN OVERLAP AND THE REQUIRED COLLIMATION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES SENSITIVITY. DIFFERENT TRACERS COULD BE IMAGED SEQUENTIALLY WITH PET BUT MULTIPLE SCANS INCREASE THE DOSE EXPOSURE FROM THE REQUIRED CT SCANS. IT ALSO REQUIRES SUFFICIENT DECAY OF ONE TRACER OVER TIME TO BE ABLE TO IMAGE THE REMAINING ONE, DECREASING CONVENIENCE FOR PATIENTS. FOR THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT ISOTOPES THIS REQUIRES AN EVEN MORE COMPLEX COORDINATION. AS A SOLUTION, WE PROPOSE THE NEW MODALITY OF MULTICOLOR PET (MPET), WHICH ALLOWS FOR SIMULTANEOUS PET ACQUISITIONS OF UP TO FOUR DIFFERENT RADIOTRACERS AT THE SAME TIME. THIS NEW IMAGING PARADIGM UTILIZES ONE STANDARD (PURE) POSITRON EMITTER TOGETHER WITH POSITRON-GAMMA EMITTERS THAT PRODUCE TRIPLE (POSITRON-GAMMA) COINCIDENCES, WHERE A PROMPT GAMMA EMISSION IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWS THE POSITRON AND IDENTIFIES THE ISOTOPE. WE ALREADY IMAGED TWO ISOTOPES IN A STANDARD PET SCANNER WITH THE AID OF THE ADDITIONAL GAMMA SIGNAL BUT WITHOUT ENERGY DISCRIMINATION. HERE, WE UTILIZE THE ENERGY OF THE GAMMA SIGNAL AS \u201cBARCODE IDENTIFIER\u201d FOR THE CORRESPONDING ISOTOPE WHILE THE SPATIAL INFORMATION IS CARRIED WITH THE 511 KEV ANNIHILATION PHOTONS. THE PROMPT GAMMA REQUIRES DETECTION WITHOUT SPATIAL DECODING, WHICH IS ACHIEVED BY AN ADD-ON GAMMA DETECTOR WITH SUFFICIENT ENERGY DISCRIMINATION AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION THAT IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE PET SCANNER. WE ESTABLISHED THIS SYSTEM ALREADY AND IMAGED THREE ISOTOPES TOGETHER.

ONE REASON FOR THIS OUT- STANDING CHALLENGE IS THAT DENSE BREASTS TEND TO CREATE IMAGES WITH SIGNICANT ACOUSTIC CLUTTER, WHICH CONFOUNDS THE DIFFERENTIATION OF AN OTHERWISE ANECHOIC MASS (WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF A BENIGN CYST) FROM A TRULY HYPOECHOIC MASS (WHICH COULD BE INDICATIVE OF MALIGNANCY).

PRESENT NON-OPERATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS OF OBESITY ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. BARIATRIC SURGERY IS EFFECTIVE BUT INVASIVE, COSTLY, AND ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY. INTRAGASTRIC BALLOONS (IGB) HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ENABLING TEMPORARY WEIGHT LOSS (~25-30% OF EXCESS BODY WEIGHT), ALLOWING THE IMPROVEMENT OF METABOLIC PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, IGB IS A PASSIVE MECHANICAL CONSTRUCT THAT CANNOT BE MONITORED OR CONTROLLED UPON INSERTION AND REQUIRE ENDOSCOPY DELIVERY. THESE FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTES LIMIT THE REACH OF IGB TO VERY SELECTED PATIENTS AS A TEMPORARY TREATMENT OR AS A BRIDGING INTERVENTION TO BARIATRIC SURGERY DESPITE ITS EFFECTIVENESS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL OVERCOME THE FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS OF IGB BY CREATING AN INGESTIBLE GASTRIC-RESIDENT ELECTRONIC-ENHANCED METAMATERIAL ARCHITECTURE (IGEM). IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE CURRENT STRATEGIES, IGEM CAN TRANSFORM OBESITY TREATMENT WITH A DIGITAL-BASED PERSONALIZED AND DYNAMIC TREATMENT STRATEGY. IGEM ALLOWS THE DYNAMIC TUNING OF GASTRIC RESTRICTIVE EFFECT, WHICH CAN BE OPTIMIZED BASED ON SAFETY CONSIDERATION, PATIENT\u2019S TREATMENT GOALS, AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE DESIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, FEEDBACK-BASED CONTROL OF THE DEVICE DISTENSION CAN PREVENT EXCESSIVE PRESSURE POINT OR OVER-INFLATION THAT MAY LEAD TO ULCER FORMATION; OR TO AVOID INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION DUE TO PREMATURE DISINTEGRATION. THE ABILITY TO ADJUST GASTRIC RESTRICTIVE PRESSURE CAN ENHANCE TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS TO ACCOUNT FOR GASTRIC ACCOMMODATION.

AMONG THESE FACTORS, THE INADEQUATE USE OF PPE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A ONE-THIRD HIGHER RISK OF INFECTION. GIVEN THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF INFECTION, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF MONITORING AND PROMOTING ADHERENCE WITH APPROPRIATE PPE USE AMONG HCWS.

FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE FDA-APPROVED TMRGFUS TREATMENTS FOR ESSENTIAL TREMOR AND PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE CAN RELY ON REAL-TIME PATIENT FEEDBACK TO COMPENSATE FOR ERRORS IN GUIDANCE MR IMAGING, OTHER TMRGFUS INDICATIONS CANNOT ACCESS PATIENT FEEDBACK BECAUSE EITHER THE PATIENT IS UNCONSCIOUS, OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF TREATMENT ERRORS APPEAR ONLY DAYS LATER. IN THESE CASES, GUIDANCE IMAGING ERRORS IMPOSED BY THE COUPLING BATH CANNOT BE COMPENSATED AND DEGRADE TREATMENT EFFICACY TO MEET THIS NEED, OUR STUDY PROPOSES A DILUTE, IRON-BASED COUPLING MEDIA (IBCM) THAT WILL ELIMINATE COUPLING- MEDIA-INDUCED ERRORS IN MRI GUIDANCE IMAGING WHILE MAINTAINING THE COUPLING AND COOLING FUNCTIONALITY CRITICAL TO ACOUSTIC TRANSMISSION. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE STUDY ARE AS FOLLOWS. AIM 1: DEVELOP NOVEL SURFACE\u2013MODIFIED IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES FOR AN IBCM. DILUTE, AQUEOUS, SURFACE- MODIFIED IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES CAN ACCELERATE MRI SIGNAL DECAY SUCH THAT, DURING IMAGE ACQUISITION, A COUPLING MEDIUM WILL CONTRIBUTE NEGLIGIBLE EFFECTS TO GUIDANCE IMAGING. HOWEVER, AQUEOUS NANOPARTICLES ALSO AGGLOMERATE AND SEED TREATMENT-IMPEDING CAVITATION NUCLEATION IN THE PREFOCAL ACOUSTIC FIELD. THIS AIM WILL DEVELOP NOVEL SURFACE-MODIFIED PARTICLES THAT, UPON SUSPENSION, ACCELERATE MRI SIGNAL DECAY WITHOUT PROMOTING PREFOCAL NUCLEATION. AIM 2: INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF IBCM SUSPENSION FLUID PROPERTIES ON CAVITATION NUCLEATION. FLUID PROPERTIES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PARTICLE SUSPENSION, ACOUSTIC COUPLING, SUBJECT COOLING, AND CAVITATION NUCLEATION. THIS AIM WILL INVESTIGATE CAVITATION NUCLEATION WITHIN THE IBCM AND HOW SUSPENSION FLUID PROPERTIES, SUCH AS PH, TEMPERATURE, GAS CONTENT, AND FLOW STATE, CAN MODIFY OR SUPPRESS THE NUCLEATION PROCESS WHILE MAINTAINING SUSPENSION, COUPLING, AND COOLING CAPABILITIES. AIM 3: ENHANCE MRI GUIDANCE FOR TMRGFUS THROUGH THE USE OF AN IBCM. THIS AIM WILL QUANTIFY THE VALUE OF THE IBCM DESIGNED IN AIMS 1 AND 2 FOR TMRGFUS BY MEASURING IMAGE QUALITY METRICS DERIVED FROM GUIDANCE MRI SCANS OF HUMAN SUBJECTS. THIS AIM WILL ALSO DEVELOP NOVEL MRI GUIDANCE TECHNIQUES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY RENDERED IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO SEVERE IMAGE CORRUPTIONS IMPOSED BY THE ACOUSTIC COUPLING MEDIUM. THE RESULTING IBCM WILL IMPROVE IMAGE QUALITY FOR NEARLY ALL GUIDANCE TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED DURING, OR UNDERGOING DEVELOPMENT FOR, TMRGFUS, BY RENDERING THE ACOUSTIC COUPLING MEDIUM INVISIBLE TO THE MRI SCANNER WITHOUT SACRIFICING NECESSARY ACOUSTIC COUPLING AND COOLING FUNCTIONALITY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8a97b483-a237-d46a-d79b-15d987dc5a4f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01EB032773_7529"}, {"internal_id": 150745879, "Award ID": "R01EB032772", "Award Amount": 968184.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-07-22", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "ACOUSTIC CAVITATION EMISSION (ACE) FEEDBACK METHODS FOR MONITORING HISTOTRIPSY-INDUCED TISSUE FRACTIONATION IN SITU - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT HISTOTRIPSY IS A NON-INVASIVE, ULTRASOUND BASED TISSUE ABLATION THERAPY WHICH RELIES ON THE TARGETED GENERATION OF CAVITATION EVENTS TO MECHANICALLY FRACTIONATE AND LIQUEFY TISSUES. QUANTIFIABLE METRICS BY WHICH THE OUTCOMES OF HISTOTRIPSY THERAPY CAN BE PREDICTED AS A FUNCTION OF THERAPY INPUTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ENSURING RELIABLE AND REPEATABLE TREATMENTS, BUT DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST. ALTHOUGH HISTOTRIPSY-GENERATED CAVITATION AND LIQUEFIED TISSUE CAN BE DETECTED IN ULTRASOUND IMAGING, THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED METRIC TO QUANTIFY INDUCED TISSUE DAMAGE VERSUS CAVITATION EXPOSURE, WHICH IS KNOWN TO VARY WITH TISSUE PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS AMONG PATIENTS. WITH CLINICAL TRANSLATION OF HISTOTRIPSY ONGOING, IT IS CRITICAL TO ESTABLISH A DOSE METRIC BY WHICH CAVITATION ENERGY DEPOSITED TO TISSUE DURING HISTOTRIPSY CAN BE MONITORED IN SITU TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THERAPY-GENERATED DAMAGE. IN THIS PROJECT WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP METRICS FOR MONITORING HISTOTRIPSY-INDUCED TISSUE FRACTIONATION BY MONITORING THE ACOUSTIC CAVITATION EMISSION (ACE) SIGNALS GENERATED BY THE CAVITATION EVENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THERAPY DURING HISTOTRIPSY. THE ACE SIGNALS ENCODE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DYNAMICS AND ENERGETICS OF THE CAVITATION EVENTS FROM WHICH THEY ARE EMITTED, WHICH DEPEND ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES/INTEGRITY OF THE MEDIA IN WHICH THE CAVITATION EVENTS WERE GENERATED. AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO CAVITATION DURING HISTOTRIPSY, TARGETED MATERIALS ARE MECHANICALLY DISRUPTED WHICH ALTERS THEIR MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, WHICH CAN THUS AFFECT THE DYNAMICS OF THE CAVITATION EVENTS.

WE WILL CARRY OUT EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH HISTOTRIPSY WILL BE USED TO GENERATE CAVITATION IN A RANGE OF TISSUE- MIMICKING GEL PHANTOMS AND TISSUES WITH A WIDE RANGE OF MECHANICAL PROPERTIES TO ABLATE THEM. DURING TREATMENT, THE ACE SIGNALS WILL BE RECORDED. FOLLOWING TREATMENT, GENERATED DAMAGE WILL BE ASSESSED OPTICALLY AND HISTOLOGICALLY AND THE RECORDED ACE SIGNALS WILL BE ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY THE FEATURES IN THEM THAT CAN BE CORRELATED WITH THE INDUCED DAMAGE OBSERVED IN IMAGES OR HISTOLOGY. ESTABLISHING SUCH CORRELATIONS WILL ALLOW THE ACE SIGNALS TO BE USED AS A METRIC FOR MONITORING INDUCED MATERIAL FRACTIONATION DURING HISTOTRIPSY TREATMENT. TO ENABLE ROBUST MONITORING, THE ACE SIGNALS CAN BE MONITORED USING THE TRANSMITTING ELEMENTS OF THE ARRAY AS RECEIVERS IN ADDITION TO HYDROPHONES. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT AN ACOUSTICALLY ACCESSIBLE PATH TO THE GENERATED CAVITATION EVENTS WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE MONITORING OF THE ACE SIGNALS, BUT WILL REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOPHISTICATED REAL-TIME ALGORITHMS TO PROCESS OWING TO THE LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT WILL BE GENERATED.

THE URGENCY AND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM PROMPT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS AIMED TO AID CLINICIANS IN REDUCING SUCH ERRORS. COMPUTER-BASED MONITORING AND ALERTING SYSTEMS THAT RELY ON INFORMATION IN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THIS EFFORT. IN THE PREVIOUS FUNDING CYCLES, OUR GROUP HAS BEEN DEVELOPING AN OUTLIER-BASED MODEL-DRIVEN ALERTING METHODOLOGY WITH SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS. THE METHOD USES RETROSPECTIVE DATA TO BUILD MACHINE LEARNING MODELS THAT PREDICT PHYSICIAN ACTIONS FROM A BROAD REPRESENTATION OF PATIENT STATES. AN ALERT IS RAISED IF A MANAGEMENT ACTION (OR ITS OMISSION) FOR THE CURRENT PATIENT DEVIATES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PREDICTED MANAGEMENT ACTIONS FOR SIMILAR PATIENTS. AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN ACTUAL ALERT GENERATED BY THE SYSTEM, CONSIDER A PATIENT WHO HAS RECENTLY UNDERGONE A LIVER TRANSPLANT AND RECEIVES TACROLIMUS AS IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENT. THE PATIENT SUFFERS A COMPLICATION AND UNDERGOES CORRECTIVE SURGERY; HOWEVER, INADVERTENTLY, TACROLIMUS IS NOT REORDERED FOLLOWING THE SURGERY. SINCE NOT RECEIVING THE EXPECTED MEDICATION REPRESENTS A DEVIATION FROM PREDICTED MANAGEMENT PRACTICE IN SIMILAR PATIENTS, IT IS A CLINICAL OUTLIER.

IF TRUE, THIS COULD ENABLE NEW STUDIES OF BRAIN COMPUTATION AND CIRCUITRY AS SEVERAL CORTICAL LAYERS ARE THE WELL- KNOWN INPUTS AND OUTPUTS ALONG CANONICAL FEEDFORWARD AND FEEDBACK PATHWAYS OF BRAIN COMMUNICATION. THE MAIN CHALLENGE FACED BY THIS EMERGING FIELD OF \u201cLAMINAR FMRI\u201d IS HOW TO INTERPRET THE COMPLEX HEMODYNAMIC SIGNALS TO INFER THE UNDERLYING PATTERNS OF NEURAL ACTIVITY. MOTIVATED BY THIS, OUR OVERALL GOAL IS TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO MEASURE NEURAL ACTIVITY FROM DISTINCT CORTICAL LAYERS WITH HUMAN FMRI THROUGH DETAILED BIOPHYSICAL MODELING OF THE UNDERLYING HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSE. WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK TO SIMULATE THE FMRI SIGNALS USING REALISTIC MICROVASCULAR NETWORKS AND DYNAMICS OF ASSOCIATED BLOOD FLOW, VOLUME, AND OXYGENATION CHANGES THAT ACCOMPANY NEURAL ACTIVITY. THIS FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN VALIDATED USING OPTICAL MICROSCOPY MEASURES OF THE MICROVASCULAR ANATOMY AND DYNAMICS FROM SMALL ANIMAL MODELS, AND HERE WE EXTEND IT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE HUMAN CORTEX.

IT TAKES SEVERAL MINUTES TO ACQUIRE HIGH-RESOLUTION MR IMAGES, WHICH CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR PEDIATRIC SUBJECT COMPLIANCE AND LIMITS CLINICAL ADOPTION. DUE TO POOR SIGNAL CONTRAST BETWEEN BONE AND ITS SURROUNDING TISSUES IN MR IMAGES, EXISTING MANUAL SIGNAL INTENSITY-BASED APPROACHES ARE CHALLENGING AND NOT SUITABLE FOR CLINICAL TRANSLATION. OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL MR TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE CT-EQUIVALENT 3D HIGH-RESOLUTION CRANIAL BONE IMAGING. FOUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED: 1) DEVELOP MOTION CORRECTION TO ADDRESS HEAD MOTION IN UNSEDATED PEDIATRIC PATIENTS; 2) DEVELOP AN MR IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION METHOD REGULARIZED BY A DEEP-LEARNING PRIOR TO REDUCE MR ACQUISITION TIME TO 1 MINUTE OR BELOW; 3) DEVELOP A 3D BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORK TO ESTIMATE PSEUDO-CT (PCT) AND UNCERTAINTY MAPS FROM MRI FOR ROBUST AND AUTOMATED IMAGE POST-PROCESSING; AND 4) DETERMINE THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF PCT IN IDENTIFYING CRANIAL FRACTURES AND CRANIAL SUTURE PATENCY.

HOWEVER, ACCESS TO MRI IS SEVERELY LIMITED BY ITS EXPENSIVE HARDWARE, COMPLEX SITING REQUIREMENTS AND TYPICALLY-QUALITATIVE IMAGES, WHICH REQUIRE HIGHLY SKILLED RADIOLOGISTS TO INTERPRET. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES A FUNDAMENTALLY NEW WAY TO ENCODE MRI THAT COULD ENABLE SUB- STANTIALLY CHEAPER AND MORE EXIBLE QUANTITATIVE MRI SCANNERS.  TODAY THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF MRI SCANS ARE ENCODED USING TWO PRIMARY METHODS: B0 GRADIENTS AND PARALLEL IMAGING USING AN ARRAY OF RECEIVER COILS. B0 GRADIENTS TAKE UP A SIGNICANT FRACTION OF THE BORE DIAM- ETER; ARE LOUD AND INDUCE PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATION, COMPROMISING PATIENT COMFORT; THEY HAVE RELATIVELY LONG SWITCHING TIMES DUE TO THE HIGH INDUCTANCE OF THE COILS; THEY REQUIRE BULKY COOLING SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMIZED AM- PLIERS; THEY ARE EXPENSIVE, REPRESENTING 25-30% OF THE COST OF A CLINICAL SCANNER; AND THEY MUST BE CAREFULLY DESIGNED AND CUSTOMIZED TO A SCANNER'S B0 MAGNET. B0 GRADIENT ENCODING ALSO SUFFERS FROM SPATIAL ERRORS DUE TO CONCOMITANT TERMS, WHICH INCREASE WITH DECREASING B0 ELD STRENGTH AND WILL LIMIT THE PERFORMANCE OF EMERGING PORTABLE AND LOW-COST MRI SYSTEMS. PARALLEL IMAGING ENABLES SCAN ACCELERATION BY DIFFERENTIATING SIGNALS ACROSS LARGE SPATIAL DISTANCES, BUT CANNOT ENCODE COMPLETE IMAGES ON ITS OWN. WHILE SOME HAVE PROPOSED A THIRD CLASS OF ENCODING METHODS USING RADIOFREQUENCY TRANSMIT (B1+) GRADIENTS, NONE OF THE METHODS DESCRIBED TO DATE HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED INTO CLINICAL USE BECAUSE OF PRACTICAL LIMITS ON THEIR PERFORMANCE, STRINGENT HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS AND LACK OF EXIBILITY IN IMAGE CONTRAST.  THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A FOURTH, FUNDAMENTALLY NEW WAY TO ENCODE MRI BASED ON PARALLEL TRANSMISSION USING B1+-SELECTIVE PULSES PRODUCED BY WIRELESS RF COIL UNITS WITH ON-COIL AMPLIERS THAT PERFORM RF TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION, COMBINED WITH AN ACQUISITION AND RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS INSPIRED BY MR FINGER- PRINTING (MRF). THIS NEW METHOD, SELECTIVE ENCODING THROUGH NUTATION AND FINGERPRINTING (SENF), COMPLETELY ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR B0 GRADIENTS AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH A WIDE RANGE OF MAGNET DESIGNS AND EXIBLE AC- QUISITION STRATEGIES.

AS MANY NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS HAVE THEIR GENESIS IN FETAL LIFE, THERE IS A NEED TO ACCURATELY QUANTIFY NORMAL AND ABNORMAL FETAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT FROM BOTH THE PERSPECTIVE OF FETAL BRAIN STRUCTURE AND BODY MOTION. BETTER IMAGING TOOLS WOULD ENABLE US TO EXPLORE HOW FETAL NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, SUCH AS OPIOIDS, MATERNAL OBESITY, OR COVID-19, IMPACT EARLY BRAIN STRUCTURE AND BODY MOVEMENTS. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) T2-WEIGHTED, SINGLE-SHOT FAST-SPIN-ECHO (E.G. HASTE) IMAGES PROVIDE A UNIQUE WINDOW INTO THIS CRITICAL PHASE OF STRUCTURAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DETECT SUBTLE ABNORMALITIES. HOWEVER, FETAL BRAIN MRI IS CHALLENGING DUE TO FETAL MOTION, WHICH LEADS TO IMAGE ARTIFACTS, DOUBLE OBLIQUE ACQUISITIONS AND INCOMPLETE BRAIN COVERAGE. AS A RESULT, TRAINED MR TECHNOLOGISTS MUST \u201cCHASE THE FETUS\u201d TO AMASS THE NECESSARY IMAGES TO DIAGNOSE THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF LESIONS, RESULTING IN LONG SCAN TIMES AND HIGHER RF ENERGY DEPOSITION. THUS, FETAL BRAIN MRI IS INEFFICIENT, LIMITED TO SPECIALIZED CENTERS, AND DIAGNOSIS IS STILL DIFFICULT BECAUSE FETAL MOTION RESULTS IN EACH IMAGE BEING AN INDEPENDENT SLICE THAT CANNOT BE REFERENCED TO ANOTHER SLICE, MAKING CONFIRMATION OF SUSPICIOUS FINDINGS DIFFICULT. AT THE SAME TIME, FETAL MOTION IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF FUNCTIONAL NEUROLOGICAL INTEGRITY, INFORMING POSTNATAL OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, CURRENT CLINICAL MR AND ULTRASOUND ASSESSMENTS OF FETAL MOTION DO NOT FULLY CAPTURE THE COMPLEX 3D MOTIONS OF ALL BODY PARTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. BETTER ASSESSMENT OF FETAL NEUROLOGICAL HEALTH REQUIRES NOVEL TOOLS TO AUTOMATICALLY AND EFFICIENTLY OBTAIN COHERENT, HIGH QUALITY HASTE FETAL BRAIN VOLUMES AND TO CHARACTERIZE 3D FETAL WHOLE-BODY MOTION. TO ADDRESS THESE UNMET NEEDS, WE WILL LEVERAGE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODELS AND PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING AIMS: (1) DEVELOP A SELF-DRIVING ENGINE FOR EFFICIENT ACQUISITION OF HIGH-QUALITY HASTE FETAL BRAIN VOLUMES AND (2) ENABLE AUTOMATED FETAL WHOLE-BODY MOTION TRACKING AND CHARACTERIZATION.

WITH OVER 70% OF LIVER CANCER PATIENTS SURGICALLY UNRESECTABLE, STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIATION THERAPY (SBRT) HAS BECOME AN ESSENTIAL NON-INVASIVE ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT. HOWEVER, DESPITE ITS PROMISE, LIVER SBRT HAS A LOCAL FAILURE RATE OF OVER 20% AT 2-3 YEARS, GRADE 3+ TOXICITY OVER 20%, AND RESULTED IN DEATHS FOR OVER 10% OF CIRRHOTIC PATIENTS. PREVIOUS STUDIES DEMONSTRATED STRONG ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE TREATMENT OUTCOME AND THE RT DELIVERY ACCURACY. ACCURACY OF LIVER SBRT IS SEVERELY IMPAIRED BY PATIENT MOTION, SUCH AS BREATHING AND DAILY MOTIONS. CURRENT PRACTICE USES A LARGE PLANNING TARGET VOLUME (PTV) MARGIN OF 5-10MM TO ACCOUNT FOR PATIENT MOTION, WHICH LEADS TO INCREASED DOSE TO NORMAL TISSUES INCREASING THE TOXICITY AND LIMITING DOSE ESCALATION TO INCREASE TUMOR CONTROL. LACK OF EFFECTIVE MOTION MANAGEMENT IS A KEY BARRIER TO IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN LIVER SBRT. SEVERAL CHALLENGES EXIST FOR ESTABLISHING EFFECTIVE MOTION MANAGEMENT: (1) LACK OF GROUND-TRUTH (GT) FOR EVALUATION. LIVER SBRT IS MOSTLY GUIDED BY CONE-BEAM CT (CBCT), WHICH HAS LIMITED TUMOR VISIBILITY. THUS, NO GT TUMOR VOLUME CAN BE DEFINED IN CBCT TO EVALUATE THE TREATMENT ERRORS. (2) LACK OF EFFECTIVE OPTIMIZATION TOOLS: IN PATIENT DATA, VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING MOTION MANAGEMENT COMPOUND ONE ANOTHER AND CANNOT BE SEPARATED TO BE OPTIMIZED INDIVIDUALLY. (3) LACK OF INDIVIDUALIZED STRATEGY. THE CURRENT POPULATION-BASED APPROACH IS FAR FROM OPTIMAL FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. DIGITAL SIMULATION PROVIDES GT IMAGES AND MOTION PATTERNS, EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR OPTIMIZATION WITH WELL- CONTROLLED PARAMETERS, AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR PATIENT-SPECIFIC SIMULATION. HOWEVER, CURRENT PHANTOMS LACK REALISTIC SIMULATION OF IMAGING AND MOTIONS AS WELL AS PATIENT-SPECIFIC SIMULATION. WE WILL ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS BY PURSUING THE FOLLOWING AIMS: AIM 1: ESTABLISH GENERIC XMAN TO SIMULATE PATIENT IMAGING AND MOTIONS IN THE ENTIRE RT WORKFLOW. AIM 2: ESTABLISH PATIENT-SPECIFIC ADAPTIVE XMAN (PAXMAN) TO CUSTOMIZE MOTION MANAGEMENT. AIM 3: TRANSLATE AND APPLY XMAN AND PAXMAN IN RT TO VALIDATE THEIR CLINICAL IMPACT. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT PTV MARGIN CAN BE REDUCED TO 3-5 MM WHILE ENSURING TUMOR COVERAGE AND MINIMIZING NORMAL TISSUE DOSE USING XMAN.

IT IS DIVIDED INTO MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALLY SPECIALIZED UNITS CALLED THALAMIC NUCLEI WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN SEVERAL PSYCHIATRIC AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES SUCH AS ESSENTIAL TREMOR, PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE, AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION OF THALAMIC NUCLEI FROM MRI DATA IS NOT COMMONPLACE, DUE TO THEIR POOR VISIBILITY IN CONVENTIONAL MRI. SEGMENTATION METHODS BASED ON FUNCTIONAL MRI (FMRI) AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING (DTI) HAVE BEEN LIMITED BY THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THE ECHO-PLANAR IMAGING (EPI) ACQUISITION AND POOR DIFFUSION ANISOTROPY IN THE GREY-MATTER DOMINATED THALAMUS.

THE LASSEN PLOT YIELDS TWO POINT ESTIMATES: A FRACTIONAL OCCUPANCY OF THE TARGET BY THE DRUG (ODRUG) AND THE NONDISPLACEABLE UPTAKE OF THE TRACER (VND). ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THIS POPULAR METHOD ARE THAT (A) BOTH MEASURES ARE UNIFORM ACROSS THE WHOLE BRAIN AND (B) THE PET TRACER BINDS TO THE IDENTICAL POPULATION OF TARGET SITES AS THE CANDIDATE DRUG.

THESE SURGERIES ARE COMMONLY PERFORMED BY INSERTING ENDOVASCULAR EQUIPMENT INTO THE GROIN OR ARM AND NAVIGATING TO DISTAL ARTERIES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF AXIAL LOADING AND ROTATION OF THE BASE OF THE TOOLS, UTILIZING THE CURVED TIPS TO DEECT INTO INTENDED LOCATIONS AND VESSELS. DESPITE THE MANY BENETS OF ENDOVASCULAR SURGERIES, VASCULAR ANATOMY, PARTICULARLY FOR ELDERLY PATIENTS WHO REPRESENT A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE UNDERGOING SUCH PROCEDURES, CAN DEMONSTRATE EXCESSIVE TORTUOSITY AND SEVERE ANGULATION, LEADING TO HIGH-RISK , TIME-INTENSIVE PROCEDURES THAT CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED BY A SELECT NUMBER OF EXPERTLY TRAINED SPECIALISTS. THE SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIALISTS RESULTS IN LIMITED ACCESS TO NECESSARY TREATMENT, AND PATIENTS ARE FORCED TO EITHER WAIT AND TRAVEL FOR TREATMENT OR TO NOT RECEIVE TREATMENT AT ALL. THERE IS THEREFORE A CRITICAL NEED FOR NEW ENDOVASCULAR ROBOTIC SURGICAL TOOLS THAT ARE SAFE, EECTIVE, AND THAT ENABLE MORE SURGEONS TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE CHALLENGING ANATOMIES. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, A NEW SOFT-ROBOTIC APPROACH CALLED VINE \u2013 VASCULAR INTERNAL NAVIGATION BY EXTENSION \u2013 WILL BE USED. WHEN PRESSURIZED WITH UID, THESE VINES NAVIGATE VIA EXTENSION AT THEIR TIP IN A MAN- NER ANALOGOUS TO HOW PLANTS GROW, CREATING SHAPES WITH COMPLEX CURVATURES.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE BEHAVIOR AND RENE THE DESIGN OF THE VINE FOR ES, INCLUDING THE SHAPE CONTROL METHODS, AND TO VALIDATE ITS E\"CACY AND SAFETY. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THIS NEW METHOD OF SHAPE CONTROL AND NAVIGATION VIA TIP-EXTENSION ENABLES VINES TO SAFELY AND EECTIVELY TRAVERSE THE VASCULATURE.

MODERN ADVANCES IN ANATOMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING AND THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF NEURO-NAVIGATION NOW HELP NEUROSURGEONS TO PLAN AND EXECUTE AN OPTIMAL SURGICAL APPROACH. UNFORTUNATELY, CHANGES IN THE SHAPE OF THE BRAIN DURING SURGERY, KNOWN AS BRAIN SHIFT, INVALIDATE THE ASSUMPTION OF ALL COMMERCIAL NEURO-NAVIGATION SYSTEMS THAT PREOPERATIVE DATA CAN BE MAPPED TO PATIENT COORDINATES USING RIGID REGISTRATION. BECAUSE BRAIN SHIFT PROGRESSES DURING SURGERY, THE RIGID REGISTRATION OF NEURO- NAVIGATION SYSTEMS IS LEAST ACCURATE AT THE CRITICAL FINAL STAGES OF RESECTION WHEN THE MARGINAL TISSUE IS BEING REMOVED. THERE HAS BEEN MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF RESEARCH INVESTED IN MEASURING, MODELING AND COMPENSATING FOR BRAIN SHIFT WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING NEURO-NAVIGATION SYSTEMS WITH AN ACCURATE NONRIGID REGISTRATION FROM PREOPERATIVE IMAGE DATA TO THE PATIENT\u2019S BRAIN IN THE PRESENCE OF BRAIN SHIFT.

WE WILL USE DIFFUSION WEIGHTED IMAGING TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SUPPRESSION OF THE VASCULAR HDO SIGNAL WILL RENDER THE REMAINING HDO COMPONENT A FAITHFUL REPORTER OF CEREBRAL GLUCOSE METABOLISM. WE WILL COMPARE OUR NEW METHODS TO 8F-DEOXYGLUCOSE - POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (FDG-PET) TO DETERMINE IF THE TWO TECHNIQUES PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ABOUT METABOLISM IN ANIMAL MODELS OF BRAIN CANCER. THE OVERALL GOAL IN THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH HDO IMAGING AS A ROBUST MARKER OF CEREBRAL GLUCOSE METABOLISM. RELEVANCE  METABOLIC IMAGING OF THE BRAIN IS OF GENERAL INTEREST ACROSS ALL OF NEUROSCIENCE, FROM BASIC BIOCHEMISTRY, TO COGNITION SCIENCE, TO THE STUDY OF PATHOPHYSIOLOGIES, AND IN THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSES OF MULTIPLE BRAIN RELATED DISEASES. THE PRIMARY METHOD CURRENTLY USED FOR METABOLIC BRAIN IMAGING IS FDG-PET, WHICH CANNOT BE USED FOR LONGITUDINAL STUDIES OR IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION DUE TO GUIDELINES FOR TOTAL RADIATION EXPOSURE. DEVELOPMENT OF A MAGNETIC RESONANCE BASED METHOD, WHICH IS SAFE FOR REPEATED USE, WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO STUDY BRAIN FUNCTION ACROSS ALL OF NEUROSCIENCE. THE BASIC RESEARCH DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL WILL IMPROVE THE ROBUSTNESS OF A NEW METHOD FOR DETECTING BRAIN METABOLISM BASED ON THE DETECTION OF HDO FOLLOWING METABOLISM OF A PERDEUTERATED GLUCOSE TRACER.

CURRENT SPECTRAL CT IMAGING SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED USING ADVANCED X-RAY SOURCE AND/OR DETECTOR TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE IMAGE OBJECTS TO BE RAPIDLY SCANNED USING TWO DISTINCT X-RAY SPECTRA.

SUCH LIMITATIONS INCLUDE A REDUCED FIELD-OF-VIEW, SLOWER SCAN SPEEDS, MISREGISTRATION BETWEEN THE HIGH KV AND LOW KV MEASUREMENTS IN DUAL SOURCE SYSTEMS, LACK OF TUBE CURRENT MODULATION FOR MANY FAST KV-SWITCHING SYSTEMS, AND HAVING OTHER CLINICAL WORKFLOW/EFFICIENCY CHALLENGES. IN THIS APPLICATION, WE PROPOSE TO IMPLEMENT AND TRANSLATE A NOVEL SINGLE- KV SPECTRAL CT IMAGING METHOD FOR ABDOMINAL CT APPLICATIONS THAT OVERCOMES THE LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT SPECTRAL CT IMAGING METHODS.

ABNORMAL BRAIN CONNECTIVITY HAS BEEN DEPICTED IN NEWBORNS AND ADOLESCENTS WITH CRITICAL CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE (CHD) USING DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED IMAGING (DWI). GROSS BRAIN ABNORMALITIES HAVE ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED AND QUANTIFIED PRENATALLY IN CHD USING IN UTERO T2-WEIGHTED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI), BUT THE PRECISE LOCATION AND TIMING OF DISRUPTED NEURONAL MIGRATION THAT LEADS TO THESE ABNORMALITIES, HAS REMAINED UNCLEAR DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF IN UTERO DWI.

SLOW THROUGHPUT AND HIGH REAGENT AND ISOTOPE CONSUMPTION MEAN THAT OPTIMIZATION STUDIES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING, AND THUS SUCH STUDIES TEND TO BE VERY LIMITED AND ARE UNLIKELY TO FIND GLOBALLY OPTIMAL CONDITIONS.

MENINGIOMAS ACCOUNT FOR ~40% OF PRIMARY BRAIN TUMORS WITH ~35,000 DIAGNOSES EXPECTED IN 2021. SINCE MENINGIOMAS ARISE FROM THE MENINGES, THEY CAN PRESENT IN A VARIETY OF LOCATIONS WITHIN THE SKULL.

GENERATED FROM CLINICALLY ACQUIRED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCANS, QIFS REPRESENT SMALL PIXEL-WISE CHANGES THAT MAY BE EARLY INDICATORS OF DISEASE PROGRESSION. HOWEVER, DETECTING THESE CHANGES IS COMPLICATED BY VARIATIONS IN HOW CT SCANS ARE ACQUIRED AND RECONSTRUCTED. ENSURING REPEATABLE AND REPRODUCIBLE QIFS IS NECESSARY FOR DEVELOPING PREDICTIVE MODELS THAT ACHIEVE CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE ACROSS DIFFERENT CLINICAL SETTINGS. THIS PROJECT'S PREMISE IS THAT QIFS ARE SENSITIVE TO CT PARAMETERS SUCH AS RADIATION DOSE LEVEL, SLICE THICKNESS, RECONSTRUCTION KERNEL, AND RECONSTRUCTION METHOD. THE COMBINED INTERACTIONS AMONG THESE PARAMETERS RESULT IN UNIQUE IMAGE CONDITIONS, EACH YIELDING ITS OWN QIF VALUE. MOREOVER, SOME CLINICAL TASKS AND ALGORITHMS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENCES IN QIF VALUES THAN OTHERS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A SYSTEMATIC, TASK-DEPENDENT FRAMEWORK TO CHARACTERIZE THE IMPACT OF VARIABILITY IN CT PARAMETERS AND EFFECTIVELY MITIGATE THEM WILL RESULT IN MORE CONSISTENT QIF VALUES AND THE PERFORMANCE OF PREDICTION MODELS. THREE INTERRELATED INNOVATIONS WILL BE PURSUED IN THIS WORK: 1) A NOVEL FRAMEWORK FOR CHARACTERIZING THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT ACQUISITION AND RECONSTRUCTION PARAMETERS ON QIFS AND ML MODELS USING PATIENT SCANS WITH KNOWN CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS; 2) A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH FOR SELECTING AN OPTIMAL MITIGATION TECHNIQUE AND EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF NORMALIZATION; AND 3) AN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE TOOLKIT THAT FORMALIZES THE PROCESS OF CT NORMALIZATION, ADDRESSING REAL- WORLD USE CASES DEVELOPED BY ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY COLLABORATORS.

DESPITE THE GREAT POTENTIAL OF THESE THERAPIES, CURRENT ARPT REGIMENS ARE NOT PERSONALIZED, WITH ADMINISTERED ACTIVITY DEPENDENT MERELY ON MASS, LIKELY LEADING TO NON-OPTIMAL THERAPY. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, THERE IS A CRUCIAL UNMET NEED FOR METHODS TO MEASURE THE ISOTOPE UPTAKE, AND HENCE THE ABSORBED RADIATION DOSE WITH THESE THERAPIES, BOTH AT SITES OF DISEASE AND IN VITAL DOSE-LIMITING ORGANS. SPECT PROVIDES A CLINICALLY TRANSLATABLE MECHANISM TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. HOWEVER, A KEY CHALLENGE TO SPECT-BASED QUANTIFICATION IS THAT THE ADMINISTERED ACTIVITIES IN ARPTS ARE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN A TYPICAL SPECT SCAN, LEADING TO ULTRA-LOW DETECTED COUNT LEVELS. CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES TO QUANTIFICATION THAT RECONSTRUCT THE ISOTOPE DISTRIBUTION AND ESTIMATE THE REGIONAL UPTAKE FROM RECONSTRUCTED IMAGES ARE ERRONEOUS AT THESE LOW COUNT LEVELS.

COMPARED TO SURGERY, FOCAL ABLATION REDUCES HOSPITAL STAY, INCREASES PRESERVATION OF SURROUNDING NORMAL TISSUES, AND DECREASES TREATMENT-RELATED MORBIDITIES. HOWEVER, FOCAL ABLATION STILL FACES CRITICAL LIMITATIONS IN APPLICABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS DUE TO INADEQUATE IMAGE GUIDANCE AND PROCEDURAL ACCURACY PROVIDED BY CURRENT APPROACHES. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO ESTABLISH NEW MINIMALLY INVASIVE INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF ABDOMINAL CANCERS. CONVENTIONAL ABDOMINAL INTERVENTIONS RELY ON IMAGE GUIDANCE BY ULTRASOUND AND/OR COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT), WHICH CAN FAIL TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT VISUALIZATION OF THE CANCEROUS LESIONS. IN ADDITION, CT UTILIZES IONIZING RADIATION AND CANNOT BE USED FOR REAL-TIME IMAGING THROUGHOUT AN INTERVENTION. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) HAS CRUCIAL ADVANTAGES THAT MAKE IT IDEAL FOR REAL-TIME GUIDANCE OF ABDOMINAL INTERVENTIONS: IT IS THE BEST AND/OR ONLY WAY TO VISUALIZE HCC AND SEVERAL TYPES OF ABDOMINAL CANCERS, HAS NO IONIZING RADIATION, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR REAL- TIME IMAGING OF ABDOMINAL ORGANS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY IN MOTION. HOWEVER, CURRENT REAL-TIME MRI SUFFERS FROM COMPROMISES IN IMAGE QUALITY, TIME LATENCY, AND DIFFICULTIES IN TRACKING THE DEVICES AND TISSUE TARGETS DURING MOTION. FURTHERMORE, THE NARROW PHYSICAL SPACE OF MRI SCANNERS SEVERELY IMPEDES THE PHYSICIAN\u2019S ACCESS TO THE PATIENT INSIDE THE SCANNER DURING IMAGING.

WE PROPOSE TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING MODULAR NEUROPROSTHETIC SYSTEM, THE \"NETWORKED NEUROPROSTHESIS\" (NNP), WITH THE LIFELINE DEVICE, CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM. THE NNP SYSTEM HAS ALREADY BEGUN CLINICAL EVALUATION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCI FOR PROVIDING MOTOR FUNCTION, BUT CURRENTLY LACKS HEALTH MONITORING CAPABILITY. WE ARE DESIGNING THE LIFELINE DEVICE AS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THE NNP SYSTEM BECAUSE THE NNP SYSTEM PROVIDES AN EXISTING SOURCE OF IMPLANTED POWER, SIGNIFICANT PROCESSING CAPACITY, WIRELESS DATA TRANSMISSION, DATA STORAGE, AND AN ARRAY OF EXISTING MODULES (ELECTRICAL STIMULATION, BIOPOTENTIAL RECORDING, TEMPERATURE SENSING, INERTIAL SENSING). THUS THE NNP SYSTEM PROVIDES A PLATFORM FOR IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING THE BENEFITS OF IMPLANTED HEALTH MONITORING WHILE MINIMIZING THE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND REGULATORY HURDLES. AS DESIGNED, THE LIFELINE COMPONENT ADDS MINIMAL ADDITIONAL RISK WITH RESPECT TO SURGICAL IMPLANTATION AND SYSTEM OPERATION.  AN EXCITING ANTICIPATED OUTCOME OF THE LIFELINE-ENHANCED NNP SYSTEM IS THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE ADVANCED WARNING REGARDING THE TOP CAUSES OF INCREASED MORTALITY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCI, ENABLING EARLIER DETECTION AND MEDICAL INTERVENTION THAT MAY ULTIMATELY INCREASE OVERALL LIFE EXPECTANCY.

IN CURRENT PRACTICE, AT THE POINT OF CARE (POC) (E.G., NURSES VISITING PATIENTS\u2019 HOMES AND TRAUMA SITES), CAREGIVERS WHO ARE NOT WOUND EXPERTS HAVE NO WAY TO DIAGNOSE INFECTIONS. THUS, THEY CAUTIOUSLY REFER WOUNDS SUSPECTED TO BE INFECTED TO CLINICS FOR DEBRIDEMENT OF DEAD TISSUES, BLOOD TESTS AND INFECTION DIAGNOSES BY EXPERTS57-60. HOWEVER, REFERRALS INCREASE TIME BEFORE INFECTED WOUNDS ARE TREATED, AND THE CHANCES OF LIMB AMPUTATION.

SMARTPHONES EQUIPPED WITH HIGH RESOLUTION CAMERAS AND THE PROCESSING POWER TO RUN MACHINE/DEEP LEARNING METHODS ARE OWNED BY MOST WOUND CAREGIVERS IN THE US56.

THEREFORE, NOVEL TOOLS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO ADVANCE OUR ABILITY TO REPROGRAM THE MAMMALIAN TRANSCRIPTOME. RECENTLY, A NEW CLASS OF RNA-GUIDED RNA NUCLEASE, CAS13, HAS BEEN DISCOVERED. SOME CAS13 ORTHOLOGS, SUCH AS CAS13D AND CAS13B, HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE HIGHER AND MORE SPECIFIC RNA DEGRADATION ACTIVITY THAN RNAI IN MAMMALIAN CELLS.

A PRIMARY DETERMINANT OF THE COST OF MRI IS SCHEDULED MRI SUITE TIME. MINIMUM SLOT TIMES TO ACCOMMODATE THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS ARE DRIVEN BY VARIABILITY IN EXAM DURATION AND MRI SUITE TURNAROUND TIME.

THIS, IN TURN, DRAMATICALLY REDUCES THE SUCCESS RATE AND RELIABILITY OF FETAL MRI IN STUDYING THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSIENT FETAL BRAIN COMPARTMENTS THAT ARE SELECTIVELY SENSITIVE TO INJURY OVER THE COURSE OF FETAL DEVELOPMENT. TO MITIGATE THESE ISSUES AND IMPROVE FETAL MRI, WE PROPOSE TO AUTOMATICALLY MEASURE FETAL BRAIN POSITION AND PROSPECTIVELY NAVIGATE SLICES TO EACH NEW POSITION IN REAL-TIME. THE IMPACT OF THIS APPROACH WILL BE TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE SUCCESS RATE AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF FETAL MRI FOR THE IN-VIVO INVESTIGATION OF DEVELOPING BRAIN COMPARTMENTS, WHILE, IN PARALLEL, REDUCING SCAN TIME, EFFECTIVELY MAKING FETAL MRI LESS BURDENSOME FOR THE MOTHER, MORE ACCURATE, AND COST EFFECTIVE. BY ELIMINATING THE MANUAL RE- ADJUSTMENT OF STACK-OF-SLICE POSITIONS, THE TIME THAT ELAPSES BETWEEN SCANS WILL BE VIRTUALLY CONTINUOUS. OUR PROPOSED TECHNIQUE WILL ALSO MAKE FETAL MRI LESS OPERATOR-DEPENDENT AND THUS, MORE REPRODUCIBLE ACROSS SITES, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO CONDUCTING MULTI-CENTER STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS. PROSPECTIVE NAVIGATION OF FETAL MRI SLICES TO COMPENSATE FOR MOTION REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL, REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHMS TO RECOGNIZE THE FETAL BRAIN AND ITS POSITION AND ORIENTATION; TO TRACK FETAL MOTION TO STEER SLICES; AND TO DETECT AND RE-ACQUIRE MOTION CORRUPTED SLICES. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL DEVELOP INNOVATIVE DEEP LEARNING MODELS TO PROCESS FETAL MRI SLICES IN REAL-TIME; WILL TRANSLATE THOSE MODELS INTO AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM TO PROSPECTIVELY NAVIGATE FETAL MRI SLICES; AND WILL VALIDATE THE SYSTEM ON FETUSES SCANNED AT VARIOUS GESTATIONAL AGES. TO ASSESS THE UTILITY AND IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY, WE WILL MEASURE SUBPLATE VOLUME IN FETUSES. THE FOUR SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO 1) ASSESS FETAL MRI VIA VARIABLE DENSITY IMAGE ACQUISITION AND RECONSTRUCTION; 2) ACHIEVE REAL-TIME RECOGNITION OF THE FETAL BRAIN IN MRI SLICES; 3) DEVELOP A SYSTEM OF REAL-TIME FETAL HEAD MOTION TRACKING AND STEERING OF SLICES; AND 4) MEASURE THE SUBPLATE VOLUME IN THE DEVELOPING FETAL BRAIN USING MRI.

THE UBIQUITOUS PRESENCE OF CARBON IN MOST ORGANIC MOLECULES MAKES CARBON-11 AN ATTRACTIVE AND IMPORTANT POSITRON-EMITTING RADIONUCLIDE FOR LABELING MOLECULES OF BIOLOGICAL INTEREST. BECAUSE 11C HAS THE SAME CHEMICAL PROPERTIES AS 12C, 11C IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR RAPID EXPLORATION OF MOLECULES WITH WELL-CHARACTERIZED BIOLOGICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES (I.E., METABOLISM, RECEPTOR BINDING AFFINITY, ENZYME SUBSTRATE AFFINITY, ETC.). IN ADDITION, THE SHORT HALF- LIFE OF 11C (20.4 MIN) FACILITATES THE POSSIBILITY OF MULTIPLE STUDIES ON THE SAME SUBJECT IN A SINGLE DAY DUE TO THE LOW RADIATION DOSE AND ABSENCE OF OVERLAPPING ACTIVITY BETWEEN SCANS. THIS OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY FOR LONGITUDINAL STUDIES AND STUDIES INVOLVING AN INTERVENTION, MAKING IT PARTICULARLY DESIRABLE FOR BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH INVESTIGATIONS.

THUS, THERE IS A NEED FOR NONINVASIVE, BEDSIDE, CONTINUOUS CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW MONITORING APPROACHES AT NEUROINTENSIVE CARE UNITS (NICUS). EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES FOR CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW HAVE CRITICAL LIMITATIONS.

TREATMENTS TO RESTORE BLOOD FLOW AFTER ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE (AIS) ARE EFFECTIVE IF ADMINISTERED <4.5 H FROM THE ONSET OF THE STROKE EVENT. BUT, DUE IN PART TO THE LACK OF AN IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR AIS, IMAGING (CT \u2013 CLINICAL SENSITIVITY ~26%) AT THE ATTENDING HOSPITAL IS REQUIRED FOR DIAGNOSIS. AS A RESULT, <7% OF AIS PATIENTS RECEIVE TREATMENT. THEREFORE, A CRITICAL NEED EXISTS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR DIAGNOSING STROKE IN NEAR REAL TIME THAT POTENTIALLY CAN ALLOW FOR POINT-OF-CARE TESTING (POCT). ONE APPROACH IS A PERIPHERAL BLOOD TEST USING MARKERS THAT QUICKLY RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE BRAIN INDUCED BY STROKE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL DEVELOP INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT USES PERIPHERAL BLOOD MARKERS FOR DIAGNOSING STROKE SYNDROMES (AIS AND HEMORRHAGIC STROKE) IN NEAR REAL TIME (~31 MIN FOR SAMPLE-TO-ANSWER) WITH AN LOD OF ~0.03 NG (TOTAL RNA). THE RESEARCH TEAM HAS FOUND THAT ALTERATIONS IN MRNA EXPRESSION SECURED FROM WHITE BLOOD CELL SUBSETS CAN BE USED FOR STROKE DIAGNOSIS AND APPEAR RAPIDLY IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD FOLLOWING A STROKE EVENT. RESULTING FROM A PRIOR R01, CD15+ AND CD8+ LEUKOCYTES WERE DISCOVERED AS A PREDOMINANT SOURCE OF STROKE- RELATED MRNA BIOMARKERS.

THE CHALLENGE IN PROVIDING ACCURATE BREAST IMAGING AND THERAPY IS DUE TO THE UNIQUE BIOMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE BREAST, WHICH IS AN EXTERNAL ORGAN WITH NO INTERNAL SKELETAL SUPPORT. AS A RESULT, ITS SHAPE VARIES SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THE PATIENT'S POSTURE. IN THE SUPINE POSITION, WHICH IS THE MOST STABLE AND COMMON POSITION FOR RADIOTHERAPY, THE BREAST RESTS ON THE CHEST WALL, RESULTING IN ITS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE CHEST WALL, LUNG, HEART, AND OTHER VITAL ORGANS, WHICH CREATES AN UNDESIRABLE GEOMETRY FOR RADIOTHERAPY. YET, EXISTING DEVICES FOR SUPINE BREAST SETUP NOT ONLY PROVIDE POOR SUPPORT AND IMMOBILIZATION BUT ALSO ADVERSELY INTERFERE WITH IMAGING AND THERAPY X-RAYS. PATIENTS TREATED IN THE PRONE POSITION EXPERIENCE NEW PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THE LOWER SETUP REPRODUCIBILITY, INCREASED CARDIAC DOSE DUE TO HEART DESCENDING, THE DIFFICULTY TO TOLERATE, AND INCOMPATIBILITY WITH NODAL TREATMENT.

THE CLINICAL QUESTION WE CHOOSE IS THAT OF USING THE NGSE FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL SEGMENTATION METHOD TO COMPUTE VOLUMETRIC FEATURES FROM PET FOR EARLY PREDICTION OF THERAPY RESPONSE IN PATIENTS WITH NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC). ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WILL HELP ADDRESS A CRITICAL, URGENT AND UNMET NEED FOR STRATEGIES TO PERSONALIZE THE TREATMENT OF NSCLC, A DISEASE WITH HIGH MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RATES. THE PROPOSED NGSE FRAMEWORK IS WELL POISED TO ACCELERATE THE CLINICAL TRANSLATION OF NEW AND IMPROVED QI METHODS BY ENABLING THEIR EVALUATION WITH PATIENT DATA. THE FRAMEWORK WILL HAVE MULTIPLE HIGH-IMPACT APPLICATIONS SUCH AS IN DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL QI METHOD FOR MEASURING BIOMARKERS TO MONITOR CANCER-TREATMENT RESPONSE, DIAGNOSE CARDIAC/NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, AND CONDUCT IMAGING- BASED DOSIMETRY.

OWING TO ITS MODERATE COST AND LACK OF IONIZING RADIATION, 3D-US PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANY CLINICAL APPLICATIONS FOR DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTION. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL VALUE AND POTENTIAL, 3D-US IS NOT A WIDELY ACCESSIBLE AND CAPABLE TECHNOLOGY WITH ITS CURRENT IMPLEMENTATIONS: EXISTING 3D-US SOLUTIONS ARE CHALLENGED BY MANY LIMITATIONS SUCH AS LOW IMAGING SPEED, LOW FUNCTIONALITY, BULKY DEVICES THAT ARE INCONVENIENT TO USE, AND A HIGH COST OF DESIGNATED EQUIPMENT.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW 3D-US SOLUTION (CALLED FASTER) THAT USES A NOVEL, FAST-TILTING MICROFABRICATED ACOUSTIC REFLECTOR TO ACHIEVE HIGH-SPEED AND HIGH-FUNCTIONALITY 3D-US IMAGING. THE ACOUSTIC REFLECTOR IS WATER-IMMERSIBLE AND ENCLOSED IN A CLIP-ON DEVICE THAT IS COMPACT, LIGHTWEIGHT, AND LOW-COST.

ALSO, FASTER ACHIEVES A MUCH HIGHER IMAGING VOLUME RATE (UP TO 1000 HZ) THAN CONVENTIONAL 3D-US TECHNOLOGIES. FASTER IS COMPATIBLE WITH MOST ULTRASOUND SYSTEMS ON THE MARKET RANGING FROM PREMIUM SCANNERS TO PORTABLE AND HANDHELD DEVICES.

SECOND, MRI DOES NOT INTRODUCE IONIZATION RADIATION IN A PET/MR STUDY. THIS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF RADIATION DOSE MAKES PET/MRI AN ATTRACTIVE MODALITY FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS AND THOSE REQUIRING RECURRING PET STUDIES. THIRD, PET/MR IMAGING CAN OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY, UNLIKE SEQUENTIAL PET/CT, RESULTING IN TEMPORAL IN ADDITION TO SPATIAL CORRELATION OF PET WITH MR DATA. DESPITE THESE ATTRACTIVE FEATURES, THE ADOPTION OF PET/MRI HAS BEEN SLOW SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION IN 2011. ONE MAIN REASON FOR THIS SLOW ADOPTION IS THE HIGH COST OF PROCURING AN INTEGRATED PET/MRI SYSTEM, WHICH IS ABOUT $5M FOR THE MACHINE AND ANOTHER $1.5\u20132M FOR REQUIRED ROOM RENOVATIONS TO HOST THE MACHINE. THE RESULTING COST (~$6-7M) IS SIMPLY NOT AFFORDABLE FOR MOST INSTITUTIONS.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS CAN SUPPORT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, CLINICAL RESEARCH, AND EVENTUALLY IMPACT PATIENT HEALTH STATUS. EXTENSIVE CLINICAL VARIABLE INFORMATION AND VOLUMINOUS DATA RECORDS FROM MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS AND LABORATORIES ARE NECESSARY TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF MODELING APPROACHES AND TO IDENTIFY MEDICATION-OUTCOME ASSOCIATIONS FOR DISEASES.

ESTIMATES OF THE DOSE DISTRIBUTION ARE ESSENTIAL FOR OPTIMAL PLANNING OF TAT ALONE AND COMBINED WITH XRT. KNOWLEDGE OF THE DOSE DISTRIBUTION FROM TATS COULD SHORTEN CLINICAL TRIALS BY HELPING SELECT PATIENTS FOR WHOM THE THERAPY IS MOST LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE, AND BY SHORTENING PHASE 1 DOSE ESCALATION TRIALS BY USING KNOWLEDGE OF TOXICITIES OBTAINED FROM XRT EXPERIENCE. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RADIONUCLIDE IN VIVO IS A PREREQUISITE FOR ESTIMATING TAT DOSE DISTRIBUTION. FOR ALPHA EMITTERS, THERE ARE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES.

OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS THE ROLE OF OPTICAL IMAGING IN ONCOLOGY. SURGERY IS THE PRIMARY CURATIVE METHOD FOR SOLID TUMORS CONFINED TO THE TISSUE OF ORIGIN WITH THE GOAL OF COMPLETELY REMOVING BOTH THE TUMOR MASS AND MICROSCOPIC LESIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE IRREGULAR GROWTH PATTERN AND INFILTRATIONS INTO SURROUNDING HEALTHY TISSUE PREVENT COMPLETE REMOVAL IN MANY CASES, RESULTING IN POSITIVE SURGICAL MARGINS (PSMS). PSMS ARE PREVALENT IN ONCOLOGIC SURGERY, INCREASING CANCER RECURRENCE RATES AND OFTEN NECESSITATES A SECOND SURGERY TO IMPROVE DISEASE-SPECIFIC SURVIVAL. WHILE PSM OCCURRENCE IS SIGNIFICANT IN ADVANCED CLINICAL CENTERS, THE SITUATION IS WORSE IN MANY RURAL HOSPITALS AND RESOURCE- LIMITED AREAS DUE TO LIMITED HISTOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE NEEDED FOR MARGIN ASSESSMENT.

STILL, THEY SUFFER FROM SEVERAL LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT FOOTPRINT IN THE OR AND THE INABILITY OF THE OPERATING SURGEON TO DIRECTLY CONTROL THE IMAGING DEVICE WHILE PERFORMING SURGERY. TO ADDRESS THESE SHORTCOMINGS, WE DEVELOPED A HEAD- MOUNTED DISPLAY DEVICE (HMD) CANCER IMAGING SYSTEM FOR REAL-TIME INTRAOPERATIVE FLUORESCENCE-GUIDED SURGERY (FGS). THE SYSTEM HMD CAPTURES NEAR-INFRARED (NIR) FLUORESCENCE AND COLOR IMAGES FROM THE SURGICAL BED AND DISPLAYS ACCURATELY ALIGNED COLOR-NIR IMAGES IN REAL-TIME, ENABLING FGS WITHOUT DISRUPTING SURGICAL WORKFLOW. THE HMD HAS A SMALL FOOTPRINT, IS INTUITIVE TO USE, AND IS AMENABLE FOR WIDESPREAD USE, INCLUDING NON-CANCER APPLICATIONS SUCH AS IMAGING OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD FLOW. PRELIMINARY TESTING OF THE HMD SYSTEM IN HUMAN CANCER PATIENTS IDENTIFIED SOME AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT THAT WILL ACCELERATE THE EVENTUAL CLINICAL ADOPTION OF THE SYSTEM WORLDWIDE.

TREATMENT OF CAUTIS WITH HIGH DOSES OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS CAN ALSO ADVERSELY PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIDRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA. DESPITE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH TO DATE, NO CURRENT TECHNOLOGY CAN PROVIDE LONG-TERM (>30 DAYS) FOULING CONTROL. THIS UNMET CHALLENGE MOTIVATED US TO ENGINEER SMART CATHETERS TO ULTIMATELY ERADICATE CAUTI. RECENTLY, THE PI\u2019S LAB DEVELOPED A NEW ANTIFOULING STRATEGY BASED ON ACTIVE TOPOGRAPHY THAT DRIVES MAGNETICALLY RESPONSIVE MICRON-SIZE PILLARS TO BEAT WITH A TUNABLE FREQUENCY AND FORCE LEVEL. THIS WAS ACHIEVED BY LOADING FE3O4 NANOPARTICLES ON THE TIP OF EACH PILLAR AND GENERATING AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD USING AN INSULATED COPPER COIL EMBEDDED IN THE CATHETER WALL (THUS DOES NOT CHANGE THE CATHETER PROFILE). THIS NOVEL DESIGN DEMONSTRATED UNPRECEDENTED STRONG ANTIFOULING ACTIVITIES THAT CAN INHIBIT BIOFILM FORMATION OF MULTIPLE SPECIES BY UP TO 3.6 LOGS (99.98%) FOR 48 HOURS AND REMOVE MATURE BIOFILMS BY UP TO 3.5 LOGS (99.97%) ON DEMAND WITH A STRONGER FORCE, COMPARED TO THE FLAT CONTROL. A PROTOTYPE CATHETER WITH MICRON-SIZE PILLARS ON THE INNER WALL WAS ENGINEERED AND REMAINED CLEAN FOR MORE THAN 30 DAYS UNDER THE FLOW OF ARTIFICIAL URINE AND THE CHALLENGE OF UROPATHOGENIC ESCHERICHIA COLI (UPEC), WHILE BOTH FLAT AND STATIC CONTROLS WERE COMPLETELY BLOCKED BY UPEC BIOFILMS WITHIN 5 DAYS. THESE RESULTS MOTIVATED THE TEAM TO FURTHER DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY TO ALSO CONTROL BIOFOULING OF THE OUTER CATHETER WALL, WHICH IS COVERED BY URETHRAL MUCOSA AND INVOLVED IN TWO THIRDS OF CAUTIS. INTEGRATED SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM OF BIOFOULING CONTROL BY ACTIVE TOPOGRAPHY AND THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR ANTIFOULING TOPOGRAPHIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CATHETER WALL. THE BEST DESIGN WILL BE FURTHER TESTED IN VIVO USING A RABBIT MODEL OF CAUTI INDUCED BY UPEC.

LIVER FIBROSIS (LF) IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND ONLY HISTOLOGIC FEATURE KNOWN TO PREDICT OUTCOMES FROM CLD. THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR ASSESSING LF IS BIOPSY, WHICH IS COSTLY, PRONE TO SAMPLING ERROR, AND INVASIVE WITH POOR PATIENT ACCEPTANCE. THUS, THERE IS AN URGENT UNMET NEED FOR NONINVASIVE, HIGHLY ACCURATE AND PRECISE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIES FOR DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION OF LF. OUR OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE IS TO APPLY DEEP LEARNING (DL) METHODS USING CONVENTIONAL NON-ELASTOGRAPHIC MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MR) IMAGES, MR ELASTOGRAPHY (MRE), AND CLINICAL DATA TO ACCURATELY DETECT AND MEASURE LF IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH CLD, USING BIOPSY-DERIVED HISTOLOGIC DATA AS THE REFERENCE STANDARD.

ONE EXAMPLE IS THE NEED TO MANIPULATE THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF PEPTIDES TO IMPROVE THEIR FUNCTION AS BIOACTIVE MOLECULES. EMBARKING ON THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WE DEVELOPED A NEW MACHINE LEARNING TOOL THAT IS BASED ON A DISCIPLINE KNOWN AS \u201cGENETIC PROGRAMING\u201d THAT CAN ASSIST IN DESIGNING NEW PROTEINS AND BIOACTIVE PEPTIDES. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY, TERMED PROTEIN OPTIMIZATION EVOLVING TOOL (POET), CAN GENERATE A MODEL THAT DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A PEPTIDE AND ITS RESPECTIVE ACTIVITY.

ALTHOUGH LASER MICRO- ABLATION SHOWED A CLEAR BENEFIT IN DERMATOLOGY, IT REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL IN FEMALE PELVIC MEDICINE.

THE PROPOSED SCINTILLATOR HAS A HIGH LIGHT YIELD AND AN EXCELLENT ENERGY RESOLUTION. MOREOVER, WE ACHIEVED A VERY GOOD COINCIDENCE TIMING RESOLUTION. IN ADDITION, IT HAS A CUBIC CRYSTAL STRUCTURE ALLOWING FABRICATION BY CERAMIC PROCESSING, WITH POTENTIAL FOR A MAJOR REDUCTION IN COST COMPARED WITH L(Y)SO.  THIS PROPOSAL IS 1) TO DEVELOP THE NEW CERAMIC SCINTILLATOR FOR PET WITH LARGE VOLUMES AND HIGH CLARITY, 2) TO CHARACTERIZE THE NEW SCINTILLATOR AS A PET SCINTILLATOR, 3) TO APPLY THE NEW SCINTILLATOR ARRAY BLOCKS INTO WELL- DESIGNED EXISTING PET DETECTOR MODULES TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF THE NEW SCINTILLATOR AT THE MODULE LEVEL, AND FINALLY 4) TO DEVELOP NOVEL TIME-OF-FLIGHT (TOF)-PET DETECTOR MODULES BY COMBINING THE NEW CERAMIC SCINTILLATOR AND ADVANCED PET READOUT METHODS FOR NEXT-GENERATION PET SCANNERS.  THE PROPOSED CERAMIC SCINTILLATOR AND PET DETECTOR MODULES ARE NOT LIMITED TO LONG AXIAL FIELD-OF-VIEW PET SCANNERS AND WILL BE WIDELY USABLE. THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT IT PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO 1) REALIZING LONG AXIAL FIELD-OF-VIEW SCANNERS WITH UNPRECEDENTED SENSITIVITY WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN SCANNER COST AND 2) ENABLING PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES IN SHORTER SCINTILLATORS IN TERMS OF REDUCING DOI EFFECT AND IMPROVING TIMING AND ENERGY RESOLUTION WITHOUT LOSING DETECTION EFFICIENCY FOR NEXT-GENERATION TOF-PET SCANNERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1e2f11d9-030b-5288-d89f-1f6fd7f111f3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01EB030538_7529"}, {"internal_id": 131832857, "Award ID": "R01EB030529", "Award Amount": 2049461.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-04", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "FHIRCAT: ENABLING THE SEMANTICS OF FHIR AND TERMINOLOGIES FOR CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH - PROJECT SUMMARY HL7 FAST HEALTHCARE INTEROPERABILITY RESOURCES (FHIR) IS AN EMERGING NEXT GENERATION STANDARD FRAMEWORK FOR THE EXCHANGE OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) DATA.

HOWEVER, DESPITE ITS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL, DW-MRI IN THE ABDOMEN HAS BEEN LIMITED BY TWO UNADDRESSED MAJOR TECHNICAL CHALLENGES.  THE FIRST MAJOR CHALLENGE IS MOTION IN THE ABDOMEN. THE PRESENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR RELATED MOTION LEADS TO SIGNAL LOSS IN AFFECTED TISSUES (EG: LEFT LOBE OF THE LIVER, PANCREAS). THIS SIGNAL LOSS ALSO RESULTS IN BIASED AND IMPRECISE (POOR TEST-RETEST REPEATABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY) QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF DIFFUSION, SUCH AS THE APPARENT DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT (ADC), RENDERING THESE VALUES HIGHLY UNRELIABLE AS A QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKER.

DW-MRI COMMONLY RELIES ON SINGLE-SHOT ECHO PLANAR IMAGING (SSEPI) ACQUISITIONS, WHERE THE ENTIRE IMAGE IS ACQUIRED FOLLOWING A SINGLE EXCITATION.

THE BIAS EFFECT IN CURRENT SPECTRAL CT CANNOT BE FULLY ELIMINATED BY INCREASING RADIATION EXPOSURE, AND HAS COMPLEX DEPENDENCIES ON THE IMAGING SYSTEM, IMAGING TECHNIQUES, PATIENT HABITUS, AND PROCESSING ALGORITHMS.

IN ADDITION TO US B-MODE, AND ALL OTHER US MODES, THE SYSTEM SIMULTANEOUSLY PRODUCES REAL-TIME (50 HZ) SPECTROSCOPIC PA IMAGES, WHICH WERE COMBINED FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR REAL-TIME PAUS IMAGING. A UNIQUE FEATURE IS AUTOMATIC ON-LINE LASER-FLUENCE COMPENSATION AND MOTION CORRECTION, ENABLING QUANTITATIVE OPTICAL ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY AT EVERY IMAGE PIXEL. SPECTROSCOPY CAN IDENTIFY SUBSTANCES OPAQUE TO US BASED ON THEIR MOLECULAR CONSTITUENTS (DRUGS/CONTRAST AGENTS), AND QUANTIFY TISSUE FUNCTIONAL CHANGES (E.G., BLOOD OXYGENATION AND ITS CONCENTRATION) WITHIN THE IMAGE; IN ADDITION, MANIPULATION WITH A NEEDLE IS BETTER VISUALIZED WITH PA.

THE PROGNOSIS FOR MOST PEOPLE WITH THYROID CANCER AFTER PRIMARY TREATMENT IS VERY GOOD, BUT THE RECURRENCE RATE OR PERSISTENCE CAN BE UP TO 30%.

OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW PHYSICAL CUES FROM THE CELLULAR MICROENVIRONMENT IMPINGE UPON CRITICAL STEPS OF ANGIOGENESIS AND DEVISE ENGINEERING METHODS TO INCORPORATE THESE CUES INTO TRANSLATABLE BIOMATERIALS. ANGIOGENESIS INVOLVES A SERIES OF SPATIOTEMPORALLY CONTROLLED CELLULAR PROGRAMS INCLUDING ENDOTHELIAL TIP CELL ACTIVATION AND DIRECTED INVASION, COLLECTIVE MIGRATION OF LEADING TIP CELLS AND ENSUING STALK CELLS, AND PROLIFERATION AND LUMENIZATION OF THE MULTICELLULAR STRAND. OUR PRIOR WORK DEMONSTRATES A CRITICAL BALANCE BETWEEN TIP CELL MIGRATION AND STALK CELL PROLIFERATION DURING COLLECTIVE MIGRATION REQUIRED FOR FORMING FUNCTIONAL MICROVESSELS, AND THAT HYDROGEL DEGRADABILITY MODULATES THE COLLECTIVITY OF ENDOTHELIAL CELL MIGRATION.

EACH MODALITY IS CHARACTERIZED BY ITS OWN CONTRAST MECHANISM AND PROVIDES ITS OWN TYPE OF INFORMATION.  AN IDEAL SCANNER MIGHT BE DEFINED HERE AS ONE THAT COULD PROVIDE ANY OF THESE CONTRASTS, WHOSE HARDWARE WOULD INCLUDE THAT REQUIRED FOR ALL OF THE MAIN SCANNING TECHNIQUES, WHEREBY ONE COULD SIMPLY SELECT THE DESIRED SCAN TYPE, E.G., MRI+CT+USI, AND PROCEED. CLEARLY, IN PRACTICE, SUCH AN IDEAL SCANNER WOULD BE QUITE IMPRACTICAL.

IN PARTICULAR, PET/MRI SCANNERS ARE TRUE MASTERPIECES OF ENGINEERING. THE TWO COMBINED MODALITIES PROVE ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN THE FIELDS OF CANCER DETECTION/STAGING AND NEUROSCIENCE.

SINCE BOTH THE MOTHER AND FETUS CONTRIBUTE TO AND MODULATE PLACENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION, DATA FROM PLACENTAL EXAMINATION MAY INFORM SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CLINICAL CARE OF BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD. PLACENTAL PATHOLOGY REMAINS UNDER-USED DUE TO THE TIME, COST, EXPERTISE, AND FACILITIES NEEDED, EVEN IN HIGH-RESOURCE SETTINGS. PLACENTAL ASSESSMENT CAN AND SHOULD BE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO PATHOLOGISTS, CLINICIANS, AND RESEARCHERS, AND ASSESSMENT AT BIRTH CAN MORE READILY AID CLINICAL DECISIONS AND RELATE FINDINGS TO PATIENTS. PRIOR WORK HAS USED PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES TO MEASURE CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS SHAPE AND CORD COILING AND RELATED THESE CHARACTERISTICS TO PLACENTAL DIAGNOSES AND OUTCOMES OF CLINICAL IMPORTANCE. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO LEVERAGE THE SIMPLICITY AND LOW COST OF DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND THE COMPUTATIONAL AND DECISION POWER OF RECENT ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TO CREATE SOFTWARE FOR COMPREHENSIVE PLACENTAL ASSESSMENT FROM IMAGES OF GROSS PLACENTAS. THE SOFTWARE COULD ADDRESS THE NEED FOR WIDESPREAD, SIMPLE PLACENTA ASSESSMENT, PARTICULARLY WHEN INFORMATION IS NEEDED URGENTLY, PATHOLOGISTS ARE NOT HIGHLY TRAINED FOR PLACENTAL PATHOLOGY, OR WHERE RESOURCES ONLY ALLOW A SMALL FRACTION OF PLACENTAS TO BE REVIEWED.

THE IMMEDIATE INFORMATION COULD IMPACT CLINICAL CARE BEFORE HOSPITAL DISCHARGE, AND EASE-OF-USE WILL ALLOW INCLUSION IN PREGNANCY RESEARCH. THIS SOFTWARE HAS THE ABILITY TO STRENGTHEN TRADITIONAL PATHOLOGY EXAMS BY STANDARDIZING AND ENHANCING THE DATA COLLECTED, PROVIDING BETTER INFORMATION TO PATHOLOGISTS. WITH SUCH HUGE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY, PLACENTAL ASSESSMENT AT BIRTH CAN NO LONGER BE VIEWED AS NONESSENTIAL OR TOO DIFFICULT.

CEST IMAGING IS AN IMPORTANT MOLECULAR MRI METHOD THAT CAN GENERATE CONTRAST BASED ON THE PROTON EXCHANGE BETWEEN SOLUTE LABILE PROTONS AND BULK WATER PROTONS IN TISSUE. AMIDE PROTON TRANSFER (APT) IMAGING, A VARIANT OF CEST-BASED MOLECULAR MRI, IS BASED ON THE AMIDE PROTONS (-NH) OF ENDOGENOUS MOBILE PROTEINS AND PEPTIDES IN TISSUE. APT-MRI HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY TO IMAGE PROTEIN CONTENT AND PH, ENABLING TUMOR GRADING AND THE DIFFERENTIATION OF ACTIVE RECURRENT TUMOR FROM TREATMENT EFFECTS. HOWEVER, MOST CURRENTLY USED APT IMAGING PROTOCOLS DEPEND ON THE ACQUISITION OF QUALITATIVE, SO-CALLED APT-WEIGHTED (APTW) IMAGES, LIMITING THE DETECTION SENSITIVITY TO QUANTITATIVE PARAMETERS, SUCH AS PH OR PROTEIN CONCENTRATION. CURRENTLY, QUANTITATIVE APT IMAGING IS OFTEN ATTEMPTED BY ASSESSING A SO-CALLED Z-SPECTRUM, GENERATED BY MEASURING THE NORMALIZED WATER SIGNAL INTENSITY AS A FUNCTION OF SATURATION FREQUENCY OFFSET UNDER VARIED RADIOFREQUENCY (RF) SATURATION POWERS, WHICH IS TIME-CONSUMING.

COMPARED TO CS, PNP-DL RECOVERS IMAGES FASTER, WITH HIGHER QUALITY, AND WITH POTENTIALLY SUPERIOR DIAGNOSTIC VALUE. OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL OF PNP-DL TO ADVANCE MRI TECHNOLOGY. IN THIS WORK, WE WILL FUR- THER DEVELOP PNP-DL AND VALIDATE IT IN THESE MAJOR APPLICATIONS: CARDIAC CINE, 2D BRAIN, AND 3D BRAIN IMAGING. IN AIM 1, WE WILL TRAIN AND OPTIMIZE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION-SPECIC DENOISERS FOR THE ABOVE-MENTIONED APPLICATIONS. THE DENOISER WITH THE BEST DENOISING PERFORMANCE WILL BE SELECTED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. IN AIM 2, WE WILL DEVELOP AND COMPARE DIFFERENT PNP ALGORITHMS. THE ALGORITHM YIELDING THE BEST COMBINATION OF RECONSTRUCTION ACCURACY AND COMPUTATIONAL SPEED WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN GADGETRON FOR INLINE PROCESSING. IN AIM 3, WE WILL COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF PNP-DL TO OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS USING RETRO- SPECTIVELY UNDERSAMPLED DATA. THIS STUDY WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT, IN TERMS OF IMAGE QUALITY, PNP-DL IS SUPERIOR TO CS AND EXISTING DL METHODS AND, DESPITE HIGHER ACCELERATION, IS NON-INFERIOR TO PARALLEL MRI WITH RATE-2 ACCELER- ATION. IN AIM 4, WE WILL EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF PNP-DL USING PROSPECTIVELY UNDERSAMPLED DATA FROM ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT PNP-DL OUTPERFORMS STATE- OF-THE-ART METHODS IN TERMS OF IMAGE QUALITY WHILE EXHIBITING A LEVEL OF ROBUSTNESS AND BROAD APPLICABILITY THAT HAS ELUDED OTHER DL-BASED MRI RECONSTRUCTION METHODS. THE ACCELERATION AND IMAGE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AFFORDED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL BENET ALMOST ALL MRI APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING PEDIATRIC IMAGING, WHERE REDUCING SEDATION IS A PRESSING NEED, AND HIGH-DIMENSIONAL IMAGING APPLICATIONS (E.G., WHOLE-HEART 4D OW IMAGING), WHICH ARE TOO SLOW FOR ROUTINE CLINICAL USE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code":

IN CONTRAST, REAL-TIME FEEDBACK CONTROL ALLOWS SYSTEMS TO BE DYNAMICALLY PROBED WITH PARAMETER PERTURBATIONS CALCULATED AS FUNCTIONS OF INSTANTANEOUS CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEM MEASUREMENTS, ENABLING RESEARCHERS TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS NOT AMENABLE TO OPEN-LOOP APPROACHES. WHILE THERE ARE MANY BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS THAT CAN BE MADE MORE TRACTABLE BY SUCH FEEDBACK CONTROL \u2013 SUCH AS DYNAMIC PROBING OF ION-CHANNEL FUNCTION IN NEURONS OR MANIPULATION OF SLEEP NETWORK DYNAMICS USING AUDITORY AND ELECTRICAL STIMULI GOVERNED BY REAL- TIME EEG FEEDBACK \u2013 TECHNICAL COMPLEXITIES OFTEN HINDER ITS ADOPTION. BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A MANY-DECADES ADVANCE IN COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES, IT IS COUNTER-INTUITIVE THAT REAL-TIME EXPERIMENT CONTROL IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH STANDARD COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEMS (WITHOUT EXPENSIVE ADD-ON COMPONENTS). THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT DESIGNED FOR SUCH STRICTLY TIMED TASKS. FURTHERMORE, COMMERCIAL REAL-TIME SYSTEMS ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE END-USER CUSTOMIZATION FOR THE LAB, SUCH THAT THEY ARE TYPICALLY NOT PORTABLE TO THE BROADER SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. TO CIRCUMVENT THESE LIMITATIONS, WE DEVELOPED A FAST AND HIGHLY VERSATILE REAL-TIME BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTATION SYSTEM \u2013 THE REAL-TIME EXPERIMENT INTERFACE (RTXI). RTXI IS FREE AND OPEN SOURCE, COMPATIBLE WITH AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF EXPERIMENTATION HARDWARE, AND DELIVERS REPRODUCIBLE, HARD REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE VIA A USER-TAILORABLE INTERFACE ON STANDARD LABORATORY COMPUTERS. IMPORTANTLY, RTXI OFFERS EXTENSIVE VERSATILITY AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE TO \u201cPOWER USERS,\u201d WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDING A RICH \u2013 AND EVER GROWING \u2013 LIBRARY OF EXPERIMENT-CONTROL MODULES THAT REQUIRE LITTLE EFFORT FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT COMPUTATIONALLY SAVVY. RTXI HAS GROWN TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS NOW AN INVALUABLE PART OF THE SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMS OF MANY LEADING RESEARCH GROUPS.

NON-THERMAL, NON-EQUILIBRIUM, OR ATMOSPHERIC PLASMA). COLD PLASMA IS GENERATED IN SEVERAL FORMS BY USING A STRONG ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD TO IONIZE GAS AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND AMBIENT TEMPERATURE. WHEN COLD PLASMA IS APPLIED TO LIVING CELLS OR TISSUES, THE EFFECTS CAN RANGE FROM SUBTLE CHANGES IN CELLULAR METABOLISM AND FUNCTION TO PROGRAMMED OR NECROTIC CELL DEATH, DEPENDENT ON PLASMA PROPERTIES (OR AMOUNT OF PLASMA). IN THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES INVOLVING PLASMA, THE DOSE DELIVERED IS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF A SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT. A SUB-OPTIMAL PLASMA DOSE MAY BE INEFFECTIVE, WHILE A PLASMA DOSE IN EXCESS OF THAT REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOME MAY CAUSE ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. HOWEVER, NO REAL-TIME MEASURE OF AN EFFECTIVE PLASMA DOSE EXISTS. THE DETERMINATION AND CONTROLLED DELIVERY OF A PLASMA DOSE, AT PRESENT, RELIES ON EMPIRICAL MEASURES OF OUTCOME THAT ASSESS SECONDARY OR TERTIARY EFFECTS OF PLASMA HOURS TO DAYS AFTER THE EXPOSURE. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR REGULATION OF COLD PLASMA DELIVERY THAT USES CONCURRENT MEASUREMENT OF PRIMARY PLASMA EFFECTORS (MARKERS) THAT CORRELATE WITH BIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES (ENDPOINTS) NECESSARY TO DEFINE PLASMA DOSE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS GRANT IS TO DEVELOP ENDPOINT DETECTION STRATEGIES FOR PLASMA-BASED THERAPIES, USING PLASMA-FACILITATED WOUND REPAIR AS THE ENDPOINT AND OXIDATION-REDUCTION POTENTIAL (ORP) AS THE PRIMARY DETECTABLE MARKER. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE ABSOLUTE ORP AND CELLULAR RESPONSES, ALLOWING US TO DEVELOP AN ORP SENSOR-BASED METHOD THAT MONITORS THE PLASMA DOSE AND FEEDS THIS INFORMATION IN A CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT WILL USE ORP DETECTION AS THE BASIS FOR A SENSOR-CONTROLLED, CLOSED-LOOP FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEM THAT WILL REGULATE PLASMA DELIVERY AS DETERMINED BY THE ENDPOINT OUTCOME.

WHEN USED FOR NEUROIMAGING (I.E. FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY, FNIRS), FD-DOS CAN PROVIDE A GREATER IMAGING DEPTH COMPARED TO STANDARD CONTINUOUS-WAVE (CW) FNIRS THUS REACHING DEEPER CORTICAL LAYERS AND PROVIDING BETTER DISTINCTION FROM SUPERFICIAL LAYERS.

DESPITE THIS CONVINCING CLINICAL DATA, FD-DOS HAS NOT YET BEEN TRANSLATED TO STANDARD CLINICAL USE FOR ANY INDICATION. THE REASONS ARE TWO-FOLD. FIRST, DIFFUSE OPTICAL IMAGING METHODS, AS A WHOLE, STILL SUFFER FROM LOW SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO. FURTHERMORE, CLINICAL APPLICATIONS THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM THE ADVANCED QUANTITATION AND DEEPER SENSITIVITY AFFORDED BY FD-DOS ARE RELUCTANT TO ADOPT THE METHOD BECAUSE IT LACKS SCALABILITY FOR HIGH DENSITY, HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING AND IS PROHIBITIVELY COMPLEX, SLOW, AND DIFFICULT TO USE.

THIS WILL BE ENABLED BY THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF MASSIVELY-SCALABLE MULTI-FREQUENCY FD HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT SAMPLES TISSUE AT ULTRAHIGH SPATIAL DENSITIES WITH HIGH PRECISION. CURRENT METHODS ARE INSUFFICIENT BECAUSE DATA ACQUISITION IS TOO SLOW, THE HARDWARE NEEDED (E.G.

CURRENTLY, NO METHOD EXISTS FOR QUANTITATIVELY AND AUTOMATICALLY EVALUATING PATIENT- SPECIFIC DIR ACCURACY. WE ARE THEREFORE MOTIVATED TO CONDUCT TWO STUDIES: 1) BUILD A LARGE AND COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY OF DIR BENCHMARK DATASETS TO SUPPORT DIR ALGORITHM VALIDATION IN CHALLENGING SETTINGS. EACH NEW DIR BENCHMARK DATASET WILL CONSIST OF AUTOMATICALLY AND  PRECISELY DETECTED LANDMARK PAIRS, SMALL BLOOD VESSEL SECTION PAIRS, AND SEGMENTATION OF ORGANS AND  LARGE BLOOD VESSELS. CURRENTLY NO SUCH DIR BENCHMARK DATASET EXIST. THESE DATASETS WILL SPUR  DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ADVANCED DIR ALGORITHMS ABLE TO SUPPORT COMPLEX, PATIENT-SPECIFIC TISSUE  DEFORMATION. THESE DATASETS WILL BE IMMENSELY VALUABLE FOR APPLICATIONS BEYOND DIR SUCH AS  SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION AND VESSELS EXTRACTION, ETC. 2) DEVELOP INTEGRATED METHODS FOR QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION OF PATIENT-SPECIFIC DIRS. THE AUTOMATIC DIR  VERIFICATION PROCEDURE WILL USE MULTIPLE NOVEL DEEP-LEARNING MODELS FOR AUTOMATIC ORGAN  SEGMENTATION, VESSEL BIFURCATION DETECTION AND DIRECT PREDICTION OF 3D VECTOR FIELD OF TRES (TARGET  REGISTRATION ERROR). THESE TO-BE-DEVELOPED DEEP-LEARNING-BASED IMAGE PROCESSING PROCEDURES ARE  ROBUST WITH RESPECT TO IMAGE NOISE AND INTENSITY VARIATIONS, AND WILL NATURALLY SUPPORT MANY  ANATOMICAL SITES.

MEANWHILE, THE OVERWHELMING CLINICAL SUCCESS OF THE ANTIMALARIAL ARTEMISININ HAS ESTABLISHED THAT LIP CAN BE SAFELY EXPLOITED TO TREAT DISEASES IN HUMANS (INCLUDING CHILDREN), A MILESTONE THAT HAS INSPIRED US AND OTHERS TO DEVELOP 1,2,4-TRIOXOLANE (TRX)-BASED PRODRUGS THAT ARE ACTIVATED BY LIP AND RELEASE DRUG PAYLOADS WITHIN DISEASED CELLS. ALTHOUGH OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ROLE OF LIP IN NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND DISEASE HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR INSIGHTS ABOUT LIP ARE FOUNDED ON OBSERVATIONS FROM CELL LINES. STUDYING LIP IN VIVO IS A MAJOR KNOWLEDGE GAP THAT IS CURRENTLY IMPEDING EFFORTS TO APPLY EXPERIMENTAL LIP TARGETED THERAPIES CLINICALLY. WE HYPOTHESIZED BASED ON THE WELL-STUDIED MECHANISMS OF TRX REACTIVITY WITH LIP THAT A PET STRATEGY COULD ENABLE LIP MEASUREMENTS IN VIVO BY SEQUESTERING A RADIOISOTOPE WITHIN CELLS VIA FE(II)-DEPENDENT PROTEIN CROSSLINKING. WE DESIGNED A PROTOTYPE, 18F-TRX, AND SHOWED THAT ITS BIODISTRIBUTION IN VIVO IS FE2+-DEPENDENT, IT DETECTS DIVERSE CANCER TYPES WITH AN EXPANDED LIP, AND TUMOR UPTAKE OF 18F-TRX IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO TUMOR RESPONSE TO LIP TARGETING THERAPIES. HOWEVER, THE TRACER'S RAPID SERUM CLEARANCE (T1/2 ~28 SEC) AND SLOW HEPATOBILIARY CLEARANCE COMBINE TO LIMIT THE OVERALL IMAGE QUALITY. THUS, THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TEST IF A PRE-TARGETING STRATEGY INVOLVING MACRODOSING OF A COLD TRX REAGENT, FOLLOWED LATER BY A MICRODOSE OF A COGNATE 18F-CLICK COUPLING PARTNER MAY IMPROVE MEASUREMENTS OF LIP BY ELIMINATING THE BACKGROUND SIGNAL FROM UNREACTED TRX AND/OR ACHIEVING BETTER TRX EXPOSURE IN TISSUES WITH LIP EXPANSION.

CURRENTLY, 68.5% OF THE U.S. POPULATION IS OVERWEIGHT, WITH APPROXIMATELY 37.7% OF THE OVERWEIGHT POPULATION BEING OBESE. THE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERWEIGHTEDNESS AND OBESITY, THE \u201cBODY HABITUS\u201d OF THIS POPULATION COMBINED WITH THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN MEDICAL IMAGING OF THESE INDIVIDUALS REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTHCARE FOR THIS POPULATION. IN ULTRASOUND IMAGING, THE QUALITY OF ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND EXAMS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY OBESITY.  FUNDAMENTALLY, AN ULTRASOUND IMAGE RELIES ON ACOUSTIC PROPAGATION TO A TARGET, REFLECTION, AND THEN PROPAGATION BACK TO THE SURFACE. THE PROCESS OF BEAMFORMING, WHICH CONVERTS THE SURFACE MEASUREMENT TO AN IMAGE, IS SENSITIVE TO THE LOW AMPLITUDE REFLECTIONS FROM DIFFERENT TISSUE LAYERS AND TISSUE PROPERTIES. TYPICALLY, THE ADDITIONAL FAT AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE LAYERS IN OBESE PATIENTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DEGRADE ULTRASOUND IMAGE QUALITY BY INTRODUCING MULTI-PATH REVERBERATION AND PHASE ABERRATION THAT OBSCURE OR DISTORT THESE LOW AMPLITUDE REFLECTIONS.  HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF DESCRIBING ULTRASOUND PROPAGATION AND REFLECTION IN HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA, BEAMFORMERS CURRENTLY RELY ON SIMPLIFIED MODELS THAT DO NOT DESCRIBE THE PROPAGATION PHYSICS DIRECTLY. WE PROPOSE A GENERATIONAL LEAP IN HOW WE APPROACH ULTRASOUND BEAMFORMING BY USING PHYSICALLY AND ANATOMICALLY REALISTIC WAVE PROPAGATION MODELS AND MEASUREMENTS THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY HARNESS THE POWER OF DATA-DRIVEN AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING MACHINE LEARNING BEAMFORMERS. A CUSTOM HIGHLY REALISTIC SIMULATION TOOL THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED WILL USE ACOUSTICAL MAPS OF THE FINE STRUCTURES IN THE HUMAN BODY BASED ON PHOTOGRAPHIC CRYOSECTIONS.

WE WILL FOCUS ON TWO SOURCES OF IMAGE DEGRADATION WHICH WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TO BE PARTICULARLY DELETERIOUS: MULTIPATH REVERBERATION AND ABERRATION OF THE FOCUSING PROFILE. THE PROPOSED NEURAL NETWORK BEAMFORMER FILTERS INCOHERENT NOISE, SUCH AS MULTI-PATH REVERBERATION, AND CORRECTS ABERRATION IN THE RADIOFREQUENCY CHANNEL SIGNALS.  AFTER TRAINING THE BEAMFORMER AND IMPLEMENTING IT IN REAL-TIME, A PILOT HUMAN STUDY IN LIVER ULTRASOUND IMAGING WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE IMPROVEMENT IN IMAGE QUALITY IN HIGH-BODY-MASS INDEX INDIVIDUALS, WHERE DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING IS PROBLEMATIC DUE TO IMAGE DEGRADATION. THIS TECHNIQUE IS HIGHLY TRANSLATABLE TO OTHER CLINICAL SCENARIOS, VARYING FROM CARDIAC TO TRANSCRANIAL TO OBSTETRIC IMAGING, BY CHANGING THE ANATOMICAL MODEL.

FURTHER, THIS NEW CONTRAST AGENT AND IMAGING METHOD ARE DIRECTLY TRANSLATABLE FOR CLINICAL MONITORING OF TES STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY AND LOCATION POST- IMPLANTATION IN PATIENTS. CT IS A CLINICALLY IMPORTANT RADIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE, AFFORDING HIGH RESOLUTION SCANS WITH SAFE LEVELS OF RADIATION, WITH IMAGING SYSTEMS IN NEARLY EVERY HOSPITAL AND RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, AND PRECLINICAL MICROCT RESEARCH SYSTEMS COMMON THROUGHOUT ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY.

TOMOGRAPHY FOR NON-INVASIVE, LABEL-FREE IMAGING OF TISSUE PERFUSION IN CHRONIC WOUNDS - PROJECT SUMMARY  CHRONIC LEG ULCERS ARE AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 6.5 MILLION AMERICANS AND THE DISEASE INCLUDES VENOUS STASIS ULCERS, ARTERIAL ULCERS, PRESSURE ULCERS, AND DIABETIC (NEUROPATHIC) ULCERS. THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY (28% OVER TWO YEARS), REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE (NONAMBULATORY), AND HIGH TREATMENT COSTS (>$25 BILLION/YR IN THE U.S.). SINCE MANY CHRONIC ULCERS HAVE UNDERLYING VASCULAR INSUFFICIENCY, ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF BLOOD PERFUSION TO THE WOUND IS CRITICAL TO TREATMENT PLANNING AND MONITORING. HOWEVER, EXISTING CLINICAL TESTS FAIL TO MEET THIS NEED IN PRACTICE. WITHOUT TIMELY INFORMATION ON CIRCULATION, A PATIENT MAY NEED TO WAIT MONTHS AFTER THE REVASCULARIZATION SURGERY BEFORE ANY ADDITIONAL INTERVENTION CAN BE PLANNED. AN ACCURATE, NONINVASIVE TOOL FOR CIRCULATION ASSESSMENT WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE POST-SURGICAL DECISION MAKING AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF WOUND PATIENTS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) WOUND ASSESSMENT SYSTEM USING PHOTOACOUSTIC TOMOGRAPHY (PAT), A HYBRID MODALITY THAT DETECTS OPTICAL ABSORPTION IN TISSUE THROUGH THE PHOTOACOUSTIC EFFECT. THE CONVERSION OF OPTICAL ABSORPTION INTO ACOUSTIC WAVES BREAKS THROUGH THE OPTICAL DIFFUSION LIMIT, ALLOWING FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING IN THREE DIMENSIONS. SINCE HEMOGLOBIN SERVES AS THE MAJOR ENDOGENOUS CONTRAST AT NEAR-INFRARED WAVELENGTHS, PAT PROVIDES LABEL-FREE, THREE-DIMENSIONAL IMAGING OF HEMOGLOBIN DISTRIBUTION, WHICH IS CLOSELY RELATED TO CIRCULATION. WHILE PAT HAS SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS IN VASCULAR IMAGING, VARIOUS HURDLES HAVE PREVENTED ITS APPLICATION IN WOUND EVALUATION. CAPITALIZING ON THE RECENT INNOVATIONS IN PHOTOACOUSTIC SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND IMAGE PROCESSING, THE TEAM WILL ADDRESS THESE HURDLES AND DEVELOP A PAT-BASED WOUND IMAGING SYSTEM WITH UNIQUE ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF SPATIAL RESOLUTION, PENETRATION DEPTH, AND PORTABILITY. TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT, THE PI HAS GATHERED A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM WITH EXPERTISE IN PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGING, WOUND HEALING, VASCULAR SURGERY, BIOSTATISTICS, AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. THE PROJECT HAS ALSO SECURED SUPPORT FROM THE REGION\u2019S BUSIEST VASCULAR CLINIC LOCATED AT BUFFALO GENERATION HOSPITAL AND ERIE COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER AND THEIR OUTPATIENT CLINICS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE TEAM HAS ALREADY WORKED TOGETHER AND ACQUIRED PRELIMINARY DATA THROUGH SUPPORT FROM THE UNIVERSITY AT BUFFALO\u2019S NIH CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE AWARDS (CTSA) PROGRAM. THROUGH THE FOUR-YEAR PROJECT, THE TEAM WILL ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING AIMS: AIM 1: DEVELOP A VERSATILE, HIGH-RESOLUTION 3D PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGING SYSTEM THAT CAN BE EASILY ROTATED AND POSITIONED TO IMAGE ANY REGIONS ON THE FOOT; AIM 2: VALIDATE THE SYSTEM AT VASCULAR CLINICS AND IDENTIFY PHOTOACOUSTIC FEATURES OF TISSUE PERFUSION; AND AIM 3: TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PAT TO MONITOR TISSUE PERFUSION AND GUIDE POST-SURGICAL ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT PLANNING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f94a8263-c1eb-718b-03c5-bb8a878692fd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01EB028978_7529"}, {"internal_id": 94714135, "Award ID": "R01EB028933", "Award Amount": 1350278.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-01-30", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "VERSATILE FEMTOSECOND TECHNOLOGY FOR ADAPTIVE MULTI-PHOTON IMAGING", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f8e3456f-8dec-1441-72b9-fa2b342bdb94-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01EB028933_7529"}, {"internal_id": 97852073, "Award ID": "R01EB028916", "Award Amount": 2411914.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-05-27", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "BACKGROUND-FREE MOLECULAR IMAGING USING MODULATED PHOTOACOUSTICS AND TARGETED CONTRAST AGENT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f7c481d7-071a-ead9-3bda-e4e7d1e903a7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01EB028916_7529"}, {"internal_id": 137121976, "Award ID": "R01EB028858", "Award Amount": 1342278.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-10", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "COMBINED MAGNETOPHORESIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF TNBC - TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER (TNBC) DOES NOT RESPOND TO SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE THERAPIES AVAILABLE FOR BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. EVEN AGGRESSIVE SURGERY, I.E. MASTECTOMY, DOES NOT IMPROVE OUTCOME. IN FACT, PATIENTS RECEIVING BREAST CONSERVING SURGERY (BCS) AND RADIATION THERAPY EXHIBIT BETTER BREAST CANCER SPECIFIC AND OVERALL SURVIVAL THAN PATIENTS THAT UNDERGO A MASTECTOMY, FOR BOTH METASTATIC AND NON-METASTATIC DISEASE. THIS IS THOUGHT TO BE DUE TO THE RADIATION-INDUCED ABSCOPAL EFFECT. THEREFORE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT AND ADJUVANT TREATMENT THAT CAN BOTH IMPROVE LOCAL REGIONAL CONTROL DURING BCS AND ENHANCE THE ABSCOPAL EFFECT COULD IMPROVE THE CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE. ONE SUCH OPTION IS PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY (PDT). WE WILL UTILIZE MESOTHELIN-TARGETED PHOTOSENSITIZERS (PS). WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY FOUND THAT MESOTHELIN IS STRONGLY EXPRESSED IN THE MAJORITY OF TNBCS AND EXPRESSION IS HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH OVERALL AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC SURVIVAL. SINCE MOST PS ARE LIPOPHILIC, THEY ARE OFTEN ENCAPSULATED WITHIN NANOPARTICLES TO IMPROVE THEIR SOLUBILITY AND TO FACILITATE SYSTEMIC DELIVERY. NANOPARTICLES CAN BE DESIGNED TO CARRY HIGH PS PAYLOADS, EXTEND THE PS CIRCULATION TIME, IMPROVE TUMOR ACCUMULATION, AND REDUCE OFF-TARGET PHOTOTOXICITY BY MINIMIZING PS UPTAKE IN HEALTHY TISSUE. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT OF NANOPARTICLES, NEW NANOFORMULATIONS MUST BE DEVELOPED THAT MINIMIZE THE SELF-QUENCHING OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES GENERATION. MOREOVER, NEW STRATEGIES MUST BE ESTABLISHED TO HELP FACILITATE THE PENETRATION OF PS-LOADED NANOPARTICLES INTO TUMORS. RECENTLY, WE FOUND THAT THE AMPHIPHILIC PHOTOSENSITIZER CHLORIN E6 (CE6) WAS ABLE TO FORM A STABLE, WATER-SOLUBLE COATING ON NANOCLUSTERS OF SUPERPARAMAGNETIC IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES (SPIONS). DUE TO THE UNIQUE ORIENTATION OF CE6 ON THE SPION SURFACE, LITTLE TO NO QUENCHING OF SINGLET OXYGEN PRODUCTION WAS OBSERVED. THIS LED TO THE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE CE6-COATED SPION NANOCLUSTERS (CSNS) AS A PDT AGENT IN A MURINE MODEL OF TNBC, LEADING TO A SIGNIFICANT SLOWING OF TUMOR GROWTH. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO IMPROVE UPON THIS WORK BY COMBINING CSNS WITH MESOTHELIN-TARGETING AND MAGNETOPHORESIS TO IMPROVE THE SPECIFICITY, ACCUMULATION, PENETRATION, AND EFFICACY OF CSNS IN TREATING TNBC. MAGNETOPHORESIS WILL BE APPLIED USING A CUSTOM MAGNETIC DEVICE THAT CAN RADIALLY PROFOUNDLY  DISPERSE CSNS FROM ANY LOCATION IN A LIVING SUBJECT. THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY WILL IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF CSNS TO REACH THEIR INTENDED TARGETS.THE SPECIFIC AIMS FOR THIS PROPOSAL ARE AS FOLLOWS: AIM 1. SYNTHESIZE AND CHARACTERIZE THE PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF MESOTHELIN-TARGETED, CE6-COATED SPION NANOCLUSTERS (CSNS) AND CHARACTERIZE A 2ND GENERATION MAGNETIC DEVICE; AIM 2.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL NEED BY ENGINEERING TUMOR CELL VACCINES WITH ADVANCED OXYGEN-RELEASING BIOMATERIALS (O2- CRYOGELS) TO COMBAT HYPOXIA-DRIVEN IMMUNOSUPPRESSION AND IMPROVE ANTITUMOR IMMUNE RESPONSES IN RELEVANT MOUSE MODELS OF PROSTATE CANCER.

OF THE MOST CRITICAL MONITORING PARAMETERS DURING ANESTHESIA, SURGERY AND IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (ICU). BOTH HYPOTENSION AND HYPERTENSION CAN IMPAIR THE FUNCTION OF VITAL ORGANS (E.G. BRAIN, HEART AND KIDNEYS), AND INTRAOPERATIVE HYPOTENSION IS ASSOCIATED WITH POSTOPERATIVE MORTALITY, WHICH MAKES IT IMPORTANT TO DETECT BP CHANGES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO PROMPT TIMELY INTERVENTION OR THERAPY. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT GOLD STANDARD TECHNOLOGY FOR BP MONITORING, AN INVASIVE ARTERIAL LINE (A-LINE), CAUSES PATIENT SUFFERING (PHYSICAL PAIN) AND INCREASES THE RISK OF INFECTION. IN THE UNITED STATES, ABOUT 80,000 BLOOD STREAM INFECTIONS CAUSED BY AN ARTERIAL CATHETER ARE REPORTED ANNUALLY. DUE TO THE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A-LINE, IT IS USED ONLY FOR CLINICALLY INDICATED HIGH RISK SURGERIES OR ICU PATIENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE A-LINE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS, EVEN THOUGH MORE THAN 300 MILLION SURGERIES ARE PERFORMED WORLDWIDE EACH YEAR, ONLY A SMALL PORTION RECEIVE CONTINUOUS BP MONITORING. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH VITAL SIGN (ECG, PULSE OXIMETRY, BP ETC) MONITORING IS ROUTINE IN SURGICAL ROOMS AND ICUS, CURRENTLY MOST MONITORING DEVICES ARE FIXED IN INDIVIDUAL ROOMS, WHICH RESULT IN GAPS IN PATIENT MONITORING, ACCIDENTS DURING PATIENT TRANSPORT PROCESS, AND EXTRA WORK TO DISCONNECT AND RECONNECT SENSORS WHEN LEAVING AND ENTERING A NEW FACILITY. SEAMLESS \u201cCONTINUUM OF CARE\u201d MONITORING\u2014FOR INSTANCE FROM SURGICAL ROOM TO ICUS, INCLUDING TRANSPORT IN BETWEEN AND WITHOUT RECONNECTING SENSORS\u2014IS ON TOP OF THE WISH LIST BY CLINICIAN. IN RECENT YEARS, EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO DEVELOP PORTABLE ECG MONITORS AND \u201cMOBILE ICUS\u201d; HOWEVER SO FAR, NO CONTINUOUS AND SEAMLESS BP MONITORING HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. THIS PROPOSAL FULLY LEVERAGES THE OUTCOMES FROM THE RELATED R21 (EB022271) PROJECT. WE WILL DEVELOP NOVEL MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING BASED DATA FUSION ALGORITHMS TO USE EXISTING VITAL SIGNS FOR CONTINUOUS BP MONITORING, THEN INTEGRATE THEM WITH OUR UNIQUE WEARABLE PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM TO FORM A NOVEL PERIOPERATIVE PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM. WE WILL TEST THE SYSTEM\u2019S PERFORMANCE AGAINST GOLD STANDARD A- LINE AND FINAPRES BP TECHNOLOGIES. TO DEVELOP A FULLY FUNCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY FOR NONINVASIVE, CONTINUOUS, AND SEAMLESS BP MONITORING. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A PUBLIC DATABASE FOR FUTURE BP TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. THE PROPOSED MULTIMODALITY ALGORITHMS, SEAMLESS BP MONITORING SYSTEM AND PHYSIONET DATABASE WILL PROVIDE MAJOR STEPS FORWARD TO MEET THE CLINICAL NEED FOR NONINVASIVE CONTINUOUS BP MONITORING.",

UNDERLYING MICRORNA-146A ACTIVITY IN REGULATION OF FOREIGN BODY RESPONSE TO BIOMATERIALS - PROJECT SUMMARY IMPLANTATION OF BIOMATERIALS AND DEVICES OFTEN LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FOREIGN BODY RESPONSE (FBR), A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY CONDITION THAT CAN ULTIMATELY LEAD TO IMPLANT FAILURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE HARM TO OR DEATH OF THE PATIENT. THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE FBR REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE GENERATION OF FBR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL AND EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES THAT ELIMINATE OR REDUCE THE FBR. MACROPHAGES ARE CENTRAL TO DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION OF THE FBR. THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE EXPRESSION OF INFLAMMATORY PROTEINS, FORMATION OF DESTRUCTIVE FOREIGN BODY GIANT CELLS (FBGCS), REMODELING OF THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX, AND ENCAPSULATION OF THE IMPLANT. EMERGING DATA SUPPORT A CRITICAL ROLE FOR A MECHANICAL SIGNAL, E.G., MATRIX STIFFNESS, IN MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION. MICRORNAS (MIRS) ARE ENDOGENOUS, SMALL, NON-CODING RNAS THAT HAVE EMERGED AS POWERFUL REGULATORS OF GENE EXPRESSION IN NUMEROUS CELLULAR PROCESSES INCLUDING MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION, CELL FUSION, INFLAMMATION, AND FIBROSIS. THE FUNCTION OF SPECIFIC MIRS IN REGULATION OF FBR TO BIOMATERIALS IS UNCERTAIN; SPECIFICALLY, IT REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER MATRIX STIFFNESS REGULATES MIR EXPRESSION TO DRIVE FBR. THESE GAPS POSE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO PROGRESS IN THE FBR FIELD. IN RECENT, EXCITING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE OBTAINED EVIDENCE THAT MIR-146A MAY BE A NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF FBR TO BIOMATERIALS. SPECIFICALLY, WE FOUND THAT: 1) MIR-146A EXPRESSION LEVELS DECREASED IN THE IMPLANT-ADHERED TISSUES IN A SUBCUTANEOUS (S.C) IMPLANTATION MODEL, WHICH CORRELATED WITH INCREASED MACROPHAGE ACCUMULATION, FBGC FORMATION, AND COLLAGEN ACCUMULATION; 2) MIR-146A DELETION IN MICE EXACERBATED FBR PROCESSES IN A S.C IMPLANTATION MODEL; 3) THE SEVERITY OF THE IN VIVO MACROPHAGE ACCUMULATION AT THE TISSUE-IMPLANT INTERFACE WAS DEPENDENT ON THE STIFFNESS OF THE IMPLANT; 4) GENETIC ABLATION OF MIR-146A AUGMENTED MACROPHAGE ADHESION AND SPREADING ON STIFF MATRIX, FBGC FORMATION, AND INFLAMMATION IN MACROPHAGES, AND 5) GENETIC ABLATION OF TRPV4, AN ION CHANNEL IN THE TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL VANILLOID FAMILY, INHIBITED DEVELOPMENT OF IMPLANT-ADHERED TISSUE STIFFNESS UNDER FBR AS DETERMINED BY ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY. FURTHER PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGESTED AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MATRIX STIFFNESS, MIR-146A ACTIVITY, AND TRPV4, UNDER FBR CONDITIONS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEFINE THE ROLE OF MIR-146A IN THE FBR, AND TO ELUCIDATE THE UNDERLYING MOLECULAR MECHANISMS. BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA, OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MIR-146A MODULATES THE FBR TO BIOMATERIALS BY REGULATING MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION AND FIBROGENESIS IN A MANNER DEPENDENT ON IMPLANT-INDUCED CHANGE IN TISSUE STIFFNESS. WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THROUGH MOLECULAR GAIN- OR LOSS-OF-FUNCTION STUDIES. WE EXPECT THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY MAY PROVIDE INVALUABLE INFORMATION AND INSIGHT REGARDING THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS MEDIATING THE FBR TO BIOMATERIALS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL AND EFFECTIVE MICRORNA-BASED THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY FOR THE AMELIORATION OF THE POORLY UNDERSTOOD FBR TO BIOMATERIALS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e04c3b49-28c8-efb6-f8ea-b4c853900d6f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01AI172086_7529"}, {"internal_id": 100874380, "Award ID": "R01AI154959", "Award Amount": 2415014.83, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-07-08", "CFDA Number": "93.855", "Description": "THE ALTERNATIVE COMPLEMENT PATHWAY AND HEMOCOMPATIBILITY OF NANOSURFACES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7f8eb9f7-3ee7-fb7d-c649-ee912e019c18-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01AI154959_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49714759, "Award ID": "R01AI122932", "Award Amount": 692161.02, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2016-03-10", "CFDA Number": "93.853", "Description": "QUANTIFICATION OF CIRCULATING ANTIGENS FOR PEDIATRIC TB DIAGNOSIS ANDTREATMENT MONITORING", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AZ", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "18ebe923-151d-7095-dfea-7767365ba71d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01AI122932_7529"}, {"internal_id": 159761006, "Award ID": "R00EB031913", "Award Amount": 249000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-05-23", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "DE NOVO DESIGN OF A GENERALIZABLE PROTEIN BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR POINT-OF-CARE TESTING - UU PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT DELIVERING DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES AT THE POINT-OF-CARE (POC) CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE IN CLINICS, IN EMERGENCY SETTINGS, OR AT HOME, WHICH CAN POTENTIALLY EASE HOSPITALS\u2019 BURDEN, FOR INSTANCE, DURING THE COVID- 19 PANDEMIC.

BRAIN TUMORS ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ICP. DELAYED DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF THE ELEVATED ICP OFTEN RESULTS IN IRREVERSIBLE NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE AND EVEN DEATH. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DESIGN HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND BRAIN COMPATIBLE PRESSURE SENSORS THAT CAN WIRELESSLY DETECT ICP VARIATIONS, AS A GENERALLY NEGLECTED NEUROLOGICAL MARKER IN BRAIN TUMOR PATIENTS. RECENTLY, I DEVELOPED ULTRASMALL (3\u00d73\u00d70.1 MM3), FLEXIBLE, AND IMPLANTABLE PRESSURE SENSORS THAT WERE EFFECTIVE FOR WIRELESS MONITORING OF THE ICP VARIATIONS IN MICE MODELS OF GROWING U87 BRAIN TUMOR OVER THEIR 30 DAY SURVIVAL PERIOD.

IN AIM 1 OF THIS PROJECT, I WILL STUDY NEW DESIGNS FOR THIS ELASTOMER LAYER, IN ORDER TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE SENSITIVITY AND LONG- TERM ELECTRO-MECHANICAL STABILITY OF MY PRESSURE SENSORS. ADDITIONALLY, I WILL USE EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATIONS TO FIND ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS FOR MORE EFFICIENT WIRELESS SIGNAL TRANSFER (I.E., HIGHER SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS) FROM THESE SENSORS. I WILL ALSO DEVELOP A HANDHELD WIRELESS SIGNAL RECORDING SETUP TO ENABLE RECORDING AND RAPID ANALYSIS OF THE WIRELESS PRESSURE DATA USING A SMARTPHONE, FOR EASIER IN VIVO MEASUREMENTS AND FUTURE POINT-OF-CARE APPLICATIONS. AIM 2 IS FOCUSED ON EXTENDING THE POST-IMPLANTATION LIFETIME AND BRAIN COMPATIBILITY OF THE SENSORS BY COATING THEM WITH PARYLENE (THICKNESS ~ 1-4 \u039cM). PARYLENE HAS BEEN BROADLY USED AS A PROTECTIVE COATING FOR NEURO-INTERFACE AND CARDIAC ASSIST DEVICES TO ENHANCE THEIR POST-IMPLANTATION LIFETIME. FINALLY, I WILL USE THESE SENSORS FOR CONTINUOUS WIRELESS MONITORING OF ICP VARIATIONS IN DIFFERENT MICE MODELS OF BRAIN TUMORS, WITH VARIOUS SURVIVAL PERIODS, DEPENDING ON INVASIVENESS OF THE TUMOR (AIM 3).

TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM, IT IS CRITICAL TO ELUCIDATE COMPUTATIONS   PERFORMED WITHIN SPECIFIC LAYERS OF THE CORTEX BY SPECIFIC CELL CLASSES AND THE COMMUNICATION DYNAMICS BETWEEN   MULTIPLE BRAIN REGIONS. TWO-PHOTON MICROSCOPY HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY TO PERFORM FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGING   AT THE SINGLE-CELL LEVEL MICE, BUT ITS PENETRATION IS LIMITED BY TISSUE SCATTERING TO THE TOP LAYERS OF THE CORTEX. I HAVE DEVELOPED A 3-PHOTON MICROSCOPE TO OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE. TODAY, THE MAIN DRAWBACK OF 3-PHOTON  MICROSCOPE IS ITS RELATIVELY MODEST SPEED, LIMITING ITS USE FOR MULTI-SITE IMAGING. OPTIMIZING INSTRUMENT DESIGN  AND IMAGING PROTOCOL TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION IS REQUIRED FOR BROAD END-USER ACCEPTANCE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, I  WILL CONSTRUCT AND OPTIMIZE A COMBINED 2-PHOTON AND 3-PHOTON MICROSCOPE FOR MULTI-SITE, SUPERFICIAL AND DEEP BRAIN IMAGING AT SINGLE-CELL RESOLUTION.

OPTIMIZING THESE PARAMETERS CAN IMPROVE IMAGING SPEED AND IMAGING DEPTH WHILE LOWERING THE AVERAGE LASER POWER TO AVOID DAMAGE IN THE LIVE MOUSE BRAIN.

I HAVE IMPROVED IMAGING SPEED AND FIELD OF VIEW BY IMPLEMENTING MULTIFOCAL MULTIPHOTON MICROSCOPY (MMM). MULTIPLE FOCI TWO-PHOTON EXCITATION EFFICIENCY WILL BE OPTIMIZED BY COUPLING A DIFFRACTIVE ELEMENT (DOE) WITH CUSTOMIZED INTERMEDIATE OPTICS. HIGH SENSITIVITY SINGLE-PHOTON COUNTING DETECTION WILL BE ACHIEVED USING A NOVEL AVALANCHE PHOTODIODE ARRAY DETECTOR.

DOING SO THROUGH CLINICAL TRIALS IS OFTEN NOT FEASIBLE OR DEFINITIVE DUE TO ETHICAL LIMITATIONS, EXPENSE, TIME REQUIREMENTS, AND/OR A FUNDAMENTAL LACK OF GROUND TRUTH (EXACT PATIENT ANATOMY AND CONDITION). MOST CURRENT APPROACHES TO ASSESS IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES OUTSIDE OF CLINICAL TRIALS RELY ON SIMPLISTIC MODELS AND SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION OF IMAGE AESTHETICS, AND RESULTS CANNOT READILY PREDICT CLINICAL EFFICACY. TO FILL THIS GAP, THE BROAD OBJECTIVE OF THE CENTER FOR VIRTUAL IMAGING TRIALS IS TO DEVELOP A VIRTUAL PLATFORM FOR ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDICAL IMAGING SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SPECIFIC CLINICAL TASKS. THE INITIAL FOCUS IS ON COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT), BOTH DUE TO ITS WIDESPREAD MEDICAL UTILITY AND ITS STATUS AS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF MEDICAL RADIATION. VIRTUAL IMAGING TRIALS OFFER AN EFFICIENT MEANS TO EVALUATE IMAGING CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES IN SILICO BY SIMULATING THE PATIENT, IMAGING SYSTEM, AND IMAGE EVALUATION. SUCH VIRTUAL TRIALS CAN BE CONDUCTED QUICKLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY ON A COMPUTER, PROVIDING RESEARCHERS A PRACTICAL WAY TO ANSWER FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS USING THE PRECISE CONTROLS AND THE EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF A MODELED PATIENT. THEY ALSO ENABLE OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION OF CURRENT AND EMERGING IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES (HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE) TO MINIMIZE RADIATION RISK AND PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY. BY ACCELERATING AND IMPROVING IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES' EVALUATION AND OPTIMIZATION, VIRTUAL TRIALS SUPPORT QUALITY, SAFETY, AND EFFECTIVE PRACTICE OF PATIENT-CENTERED CARE. TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE, THE CENTER WILL DEVELOP, REFINE, AND DISSEMINATE THE ESSENTIAL RESOURCES TO REALISTICALLY MODEL AND REPRESENT A) PATIENTS, B) IMAGING SYSTEMS, AND C) IMAGE EVALUATION. THESE RESOURCES COMPRISE THE THREE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (TRD) PROJECTS, WHICH WORK SYNERGISTICALLY WITH AND PROVIDE RESOURCES TO COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS (CPS) AND SERVICE PROJECTS (SPS). A TECHNOLOGY TRAINING AND DISSEMINATION (TTD) COMPONENT WILL DISTRIBUTE THE CENTER'S RESOURCES AND PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TRAINING. ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES INFRASTRUCTURE, OVERSIGHT, AND INTEGRATION. THE OVERALL SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO (1) DEVELOP, CONSOLIDATE, AND STREAMLINE THE REQUIRED COMPONENTS TO ENABLE VIRTUAL IMAGING TRIALS OF EXISTING AND EMERGING CT IMAGING METHODS, (2) POSITION VIRTUAL TRIALS AS AN ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY TO QUANTIFY, EVALUATE, AND OPTIMIZE CT IMAGING, AND (3) DISSEMINATE TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY VALIDATED TOOLS FOR EFFICIENT VIRTUAL TRIALS IN CT AND TRAIN RESEARCHERS TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY. USING STATE-OF-THE-ART SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS, THE CENTER WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE PLATFORM TO ASSESS THE DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITY OF IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THEIR COMPLETE TRAJECTORY FROM DESIGN TO USE.

THERE IS A WEALTH OF MEANINGFUL, BUT COMPLEX INFORMATION THAT COULD BE EXTRACTED FROM IMAGING DATA BUT IS NOT OPTIMALLY UTILIZED FOR PATIENT CARE. CANCER CARE EXEMPLIFIES THE CURRENT CHALLENGES WHICH INCLUDE EARLY DETECTION, ACCURATE DISTINCTION OF PRE- NEOPLASTIC AND NEOPLASTIC LESIONS, PREDICTION OF TUMOR AGGRESSIVENESS, DETERMINING INFILTRATIVE TUMOR MARGINS DURING SURGICAL TREATMENT, TRACKING TUMOR EVOLUTION/ METASTASIS PATTERN, RECURRENCE, AND POTENTIAL ACQUIRED RESISTANCE TO TREATMENTS OVER TIME. MAJOR STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PERSONALIZATION OF CANCER THERAPIES SUCH AS IMMUNOTHERAPY, BUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIFIC, RELEVANT, AND TIMELY MEDICAL DATA AND INFORMATION IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO REALIZING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF PRECISION MEDICINE. NOWHERE IS THIS MORE ACUTELY EVIDENT THAN DURING INTERVENTIONS IN THE OPERATING AND PROCEDURE ROOMS. NOVEL METHODS OF IMAGE GUIDANCE, DATA INTEGRATION, INFORMATION EXTRACTION, AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER ARE NEEDED TO ENABLE CLINICIANS TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, ESPECIALLY BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER INVASIVE PROCEDURES.

THE POINT OF CARE - PROJECT SUMMARY RAPID, INEXPENSIVE DETECTION OF BIOMARKERS AT THE POINT OF CARE IS VITAL FOR MANY CLINICAL PURPOSES. HOWEVER, LIMITATIONS IN CURRENT DETECTION PLATFORMS HAVE PREVENTED THE SENSITIVE DETECTION OF MANY PROTEIN AND SMALL MOLECULE BIOMARKERS, FORCING CLINICIANS TO RELY ON EITHER POTENTIALLY INACCURATE EMPIRICAL DIAGNOSIS OR EXPENSIVE LAB TESTS TO MAKE CRITICAL TREATMENT DECISIONS. SENSITIVE DETECTION OF NUCLEIC ACID TARGETS HAS BEEN READILY ACHIEVED BY EXPLOITING WATSON-CRICK BASE PAIRING TO AMPLIFY SIGNALS (E.G., PCR), BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF INNOVATION FOR DETECTION OF LOW CONCENTRATION ANTIGENS AND SMALL MOLECULES AT THE POINT OF CARE. NATURE, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS EVOLVED INTRICATE MECHANISMS FOR RAPIDLY AMPLIFYING PROTEIN SIGNALS IN VIVO VIA POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION AND PROTEIN-BASED SIGNALING NETWORKS THAT COULD BE ADAPTED FOR BIOMARKER DETECTION. TOWARDS THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING NOVEL, RAPID, ULTRASENSITIVE DIAGNOSTICS, THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT IN VITRO, PROTEIN-BASED SIGNALING NETWORKS INCORPORATING SELF-AMPLIFYING MOTIFS CAN DETECT CLINICAL BIOMARKERS. SPECIFICALLY, WE PLAN TO INCORPORATE THREE MECHANISMS OF PROTEIN SIGNALING NETWORKS WITH POTENTIAL FOR DIAGNOSTICS: SPLIT ENZYME RECONSTITUTION, AUTOCATALYTIC POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS, AND SMALL MOLECULE BIOSENSORS. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED THE IN VITRO USE OF SPLIT ADENYLATE CYCLASE FOR SMALL MOLECULE DETECTION VIA THE SIMULTANEOUS BINDING OF TWO PROTEINS (I.E. A SANDWICH ASSAY IN SOLUTION), BRINGING TWO HALVES OF ADENYLATE CYCLASE TOGETHER AND PRODUCING CAMP. AIM 1 (K99) WILL INCORPORATE BINDING DOMAINS FOR DETECTION OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT BIOMARKER TARGETS AND INVESTIGATE DETECTION IN HUMAN SAMPLE MATRICES. WE WILL TEST DIFFERENT BINDING DOMAINS FUSED TO SPLIT ADENYLATE CYCLASE FRAGMENTS TO DETECT HEPATITIS C CORE ANTIGEN (HCVCAG). TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTIC, AIM 2 (K99) WILL OPTIMIZE REACTION COMPONENTS FOR LYOPHILIZATION AND LONG-TERM STORAGE AND DEVELOP A HAND-HELD POINT-OF-CARE READER TO DETECT THE SHIFT IN FLUORESCENCE PRODUCED BY THE FRET-BASED CAMP BIOSENSOR. LAB-BENCH VALIDATION OF ALL COMPONENTS WILL BE PERFORMED USING HCVCAG SPIKED INTO COMMERCIALLY PURCHASED POOLED BLOOD SAMPLES. AIM 3 (R00) WILL INVESTIGATE THE USE OF SPLIT ADENYLATE CYCLASE AND CAMP RECEPTOR PROTEIN TO CREATE AN AUTOCATALYTIC FEEDBACK LOOP IN VITRO. THIS WORK WOULD RESULT IN THE FIRST KNOWN IN VITRO PROTEIN SIGNALING NETWORK WITH BISTABLE SWITCH-LIKE SENSING, A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT FOR THE DIAGNOSTICS FIELD. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS SYSTEM WOULD BE BROADLY APPLICABLE FOR PROTEIN AND SMALL MOLECULE DETECTION AND COULD BE USED TO DETECT A WIDE RANGE OF TARGET ANALYTES WITH KNOWN BINDING DOMAINS. AS SUCH, FUTURE WORK INCLUDES THE INCORPORATION OF BINDING DOMAINS TO DETECT OTHER HIGH VALUE PROTEIN AND SMALL MOLECULE ANALYTES CURRENTLY UNABLE TO BE RAPIDLY DETECTED AT THE POINT OF CARE AND THE CLINICAL TRANSLATION OF THE DESCRIBED DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE WITH PILOT CLINICAL TRIALS IN COLLABORATION WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN CLINICAL PARTNERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b0be845a-babe-8a5d-2f4b-002e5eff7fcd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K99EB034778_7529"}, {"internal_id": 159204292, "Award ID": "K99EB034768", "Award Amount": 137160.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-05-15", "CFDA Number": "93.286", "Description": "DOWNFIELD MR SPECTROSCOPIC IMAGING OF THE HUMAN BRAIN - PROJECT SUMMARY IN PROTON MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY (MRS) OF THE HUMAN BRAIN, SIGNALS ARISE BOTH UPFIELD (UF) AND DOWNFIELD (DF) FROM THE WATER RESONANCE. WHILE UF MRS AND MR SPECTROSCOPIC IMAGING (MRSI) HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED IN HUMANS OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW DOWNFIELD STUDIES, AND ALL OF THEM USED SINGLE VOXEL SPATIAL LOCALIZATION. RECENTLY, OUR GROUP DEVELOPED THE FIRST SINGLE SLICE APPROACH FOR IN VIVO DF-MRSI AT 3T5. SUBSEQUENTLY, I HAVE FURTHER IMPLEMENTED THE FIRST THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) DF-MRSI METHODS IN THE HUMAN BRAIN WITH WHOLE BRAIN COVERAGE, ON BOTH CLINICAL HIGH-FIELD (3T) AND RESEARCH ULTRA-HIGH- FIELD (7T) MR SYSTEMS.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE TWO SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL CHALLENGES FOR DF-MRSI, NAMELY (A) THE LACK OF PULSE SEQUENCES TO ACQUIRE 3D DF-MRSI WITH OPTIMUM SENSITIVITY IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE SCAN TIME, AND (B) SPECIFIC SOFTWARE FOR THE ACCURATE QUANTIFICATION AND VISUALIZATION OF THE BROAD AND SIGNIFICANTLY OVERLAPPING DF SIGNALS. IN ADDITION, THE CLINICAL AND NEUROSCIENCE APPLICATIONS OF DF-MRSI HAVE YET TO BE EXPLORED. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, I PROPOSE TO DEVELOP OPTIMIZED 3D DF-MRSI PULSE SEQUENCES FOR BOTH 3T AND 7T, AND ALSO TO DEVELOP AN OPEN- SOURCE SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR IMPROVED QUANTIFICATION, ANALYSIS, AND VISUALIZATION OF DF RESONANCES. DF SPECTRA CONTAIN SIGNALS FROM BOTH EXCHANGEABLE AND NON-EXCHANGEABLE PROTONS, AND THE INFORMATION CONTENT OF DF- MRSI MAY THEREFORE BE COMPLEMENTARY TO CHEMICAL EXCHANGE SATURATION TRANSFER (CEST) MRI. IN PARTICULAR, AMIDE-PROTON TRANSFER (APT) CEST HAS PROVEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL FOR THE EVALUATION OF HUMAN BRAIN TUMORS; IN THE R00 PHASE OF THIS PROPOSAL, AFTER ESTABLISHING NORMATIVE VALUES AND REPRODUCIBILITY, A COMPARISON OF THE VALUE OF 3D DF-MRSI VS. APT-CEST IN PATIENTS WITH GLIOMA WILL BE PERFORMED. IN PARTICULAR, I WILL FOCUS ON THE ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH RECURRENT TUMOR FROM RADIATION NECROSIS IN PATIENTS TREATED FOR HIGH GRADE GLIOMA; THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC QUESTION THAT DIRECTLY EFFECTS CHOICE OF TREATMENT, AND WHICH IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO ANSWER USING CONVENTIONAL MRI.  DEVELOPING THESE NOVEL TECHNIQUES REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL EXPERTISE BOTH IN MRSI SEQUENCE DEVELOPMENT AND IN DATA ANALYSIS.

HOWEVER, CURRENT METHODS FOR INTERFACING WITH CELLS VIA RNA HAVE CRITICAL LIMITATIONS. DETECTING CELLULAR RNA GENERALLY REQUIRES DESTRUCTION OF THE ANALYZED CELLS, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO TRACK THE DYNAMIC BEHAVIORS OF INDIVIDUAL LIVING CELLS ACROSS TIME. DELIVERING THERAPEUTIC RNA TO SPECIFIC TARGET CELLS WITHIN TISSUE ALSO REMAINS A CHALLENGE, WHICH IMPEDES BIOMEDICAL DEPLOYMENT OF RNA CIRCUITS TO REPAIR OR ELIMINATE HARMFUL CELLS IN VIVO. HERE, I PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY DEVELOPING A NEW METHOD TO EXPORT RNA FROM LIVING CELLS, WHICH CAN BE USED TO MEASURE CELL DYNAMICS NON-DESTRUCTIVELY AND DELIVER RNA CIRCUITS FROM CELL TO CELL. IN PRELIMINARY WORK, I ESTABLISHED GENETICALLY ENCODED RNA EXPORTERS, INSPIRED BY VIRUSES, THAT EFFICIENTLY PACKAGE AND SECRETE RNA FROM MAMMALIAN CELLS WITHIN PROTECTIVE NANOPARTICLES. I SHOWED THAT SEQUENCING EXPORTED RNA ENABLES INFORMATION TO BE OBTAINED NON-DESTRUCTIVELY FROM LIVING CELLS, AND DELIVERING EXPORTED RNA FROM CELL TO CELL ENABLES CONTROL OF CELL STATES, WHICH PAVES THE WAY TO RNA EXPORT-BASED REPORTER AND DELIVERY PLATFORMS. TO REALIZE THIS POTENTIAL, I WILL DEVELOP FULLY SYNTHETIC RNA EXPORTERS, BASED ON DE NOVO DESIGNED PROTEINS, WHICH ARE AMENABLE TO ENGINEERING AND WILL ENABLE TARGETED EXPORT OF SPECIFIC RNA SPECIES (AIM 1).

MOST LOCALIZED TUMORS WITH NEGATIVE MARGIN RESECTION SHOW IMPROVED PATIENT OUTCOMES AND A LOWER CHANCE OF TUMOR RECURRENCE. HOWEVER, THE INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN SECTION TECHNIQUE SUFFERS FROM A SERIES OF LIMITATIONS: TISSUE LOSS, COMPROMISED QUALITY DUE TO FREEZING ARTIFACTS, SUBOPTIMAL CUTTING OF FATTY SPECIMENS, AND INABILITY TO DIAGNOSE BONY LESIONS. IN OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE 3D CONTOUR SCANNING ULTRAVIOLET PHOTOACOUSTIC MICROSCOPY (UV- PAM) TO ACQUIRE HISTOLOGY-LIKE IMAGES OF THICK BONE SPECIMENS, WHICH ADDRESSES THE LONG-STANDING CHALLENGE OF INTRAOPERATIVE BONE HISTOLOGY.

MULTIPHOTON MICROSCOPY (MPM) HAS BEEN A USEFUL TOOL TO STUDY BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES DUE TO ITS HIGH SPECIFICITY AND SUB-WAVELENGTH RESOLUTION. PARTICULARLY, COMPARED TO ONE-PHOTON IMAGING, MPM USES EXCITATION LIGHT WITH A LONGER WAVELENGTH THAT PENETRATES DEEPER INTO TISSUES, WHILE THE NONLINEAR PROCESS REQUIRES A MULTIPHOTON INTERACTION THAT RENDERS THREE-DIMENSIONAL LOCALIZED EXCITATION. HOWEVER, THE HIGHER-ORDER NONLINEAR EXCITATION IS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOCUS ABERRATIONS, THUS, POSING A LIMIT FOR PENETRATION DEPTH IN HIGHLY SCATTERING TISSUES. ADAPTIVE OPTICS (AO) HAS BEEN A PROMISING TOOL FOR ABERRATION SENSING AND CORRECTION FOR MPM IN LIVING SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, TWO MAJOR ISSUES IN EXISTING AO METHODS, 1) ACCURACY, AND 2) SPEED IN ABERRATION SENSING, REMAIN CHALLENGING TO IN VIVO REAL-TIME DEEP-TISSUE IMAGING.

SPECIFICALLY, COMPARED TO OTHER EFFORTS, CGLIM USES THE LONG-WAVELENGTH (~1.7 \u039cM) ELASTIC BACKSCATTERED LIGHT FROM TISSUES TO DIRECTLY MEASURE THE ABERRATED WAVEFRONT OF THE EXCITATION BEAM, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER POWER COMPARED TO FLUORESCENCE TECHNIQUES AND ELIMINATING PHOTODAMAGE, PHOTOBLEACHING, OR HEATING DAMAGE OF LIVING SYSTEMS. IMPORTANTLY, CGLIM MEASURES THE ABERRATED WAVEFRONT ONLY NEAR THE FOCAL PLANE WITH NANOSCALE SENSITIVITY (~2 NM OR ~0.002 RAD) OWING TO ITS COMMON-PATH, CONFOCAL CONFIGURATION. FURTHERMORE, CGLIM CAN VALIDATE THE ACCURACY OF THE ABERRATION SENSING BY ITSELF VIA PHASE CONJUGATION. LASTLY, THE ABERRATION CORRECTION PROCEDURE IS DIRECTLY FED BY CGLIM\u2019S MEASUREMENT IN A CLOSED LOOP WITHOUT ANY ITERATIONS. CGLIM IS ALSO READILY IMPLEMENTED IN ANY LASER-SCANNING SYSTEM WITH OBJECTIVES OF DIFFERENT NUMERIC APERTURES.  WITH THE PROPOSED NEW METHOD, I WILL FIRST DEMONSTRATE ABERRATION SENSING AND CORRECTION USING CGLIM WITH TISSUE PHANTOMS AND EX VIVO TISSUE SLICES. THEN, I WILL COMBINE CGLIM WITH THREE-PHOTON (3P) MICROSCOPY TO DEMONSTRATE ABERRATION-CORRECTED 3P IMAGING OF NEURONAL ACTIVITIES IN LIVE MICE AND INTACT ADULT ZEBRAFISH BRAINS.

WHILE IT ACCOUNTS FOR 2.5% OF ALL CANCERS AMONG WOMEN, IT RESULTS IN ROUGHLY 5% OF CANCER-RELATED DEATHS DUE TO ITS HIGH FATALITY RATE. THIS IS BECAUSE 75% OF PATIENTS ARE DIAGNOSED WITH ADVANCED DISEASE, LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO ITS RELATIVELY LATE PRESENTATION OF SYMPTOMS AND A LACK OF RELIABLE DETECTION AND MONITORING STRATEGIES. EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES (EVS) ARE RELEASED BY ALL CELLS, INCLUDING OVARIAN CANCER, AND THEIR CARGO REFLECTS THEIR CELLS OF ORIGIN. THEY HAVE SHOWN IMMENSE POTENTIAL AS STABLE BIOMARKERS, HOWEVER THEIR LOW ABUNDANCE COMPARED TO EVS FROM HEALTHY CELLS AND A LACK OF SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE CHARACTERIZATION TOOLS HAS LIMITED THEIR CLINICAL TRANSLATION. SURFACE-ENHANCED RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY (SERS) IS SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO BIOCHEMICALLY FINGERPRINT EVEN SINGLE EVS, AND THE INFORMATION-RICH SPECTRA PRODUCED IN EV SERS CAN BE FED INTO MACHINE LEARNING (ML) ALGORITHMS TO CLASSIFY THEM BASED ON THEIR LATENT SPECTRAL FEATURES. DESPITE EARLY PROGRESS IN EV SERS, THE HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS NATURE OF EVS INDICATES THAT THEIR SEPARATION INTO DISTINCT SUBPOPULATIONS PRIOR TO SERS ANALYSIS MAY HELP IMPROVE DISEASE DIAGNOSIS, CLASSIFICATION, AND MONITORING.

PANCREATIC CANCER IS CURRENTLY THE FOURTH LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER-RELATED MORTALITY IN THE US. THE ABILITY TO DIAGNOSE PANCREATIC CANCER AT EARLY STAGES WOULD ALLOW MANY PATIENTS TO BE ACTIVELY TREATED, THEREBY GREATLY IMPROVING THEIR OUTCOMES. SERUM BIOMARKER MEASUREMENTS HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED AS DIAGNOSTIC/PROGNOSTIC INDICATORS, BUT MANY MARKERS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR SPECIFIC ASSESSMENTS OF DISEASE STATES. MAJOR FACTORS LIMITING PRECISE DIAGNOSIS US- ING THESE BIOMARKERS INCLUDE THEIR LOW SENSITIVITY AT HIGH SPECIFICITY FOR DISEASES AND THE OVERALL DEARTH OF ESTAB- LISHED MOLECULAR MARKERS. THEREFORE, INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE DISEASE-STATE SPECIFICITY/SENSITIVITY AND BIOMARKER DISCOVERY EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF MANY CONDITIONS.

HOWEVER, POOR UMI IMAGE QUALITY HAS LED RESEARCHERS TO TRADE THE BENETS OF REAL-TIME AND FREEHAND IMAGING FOR BETTER IMAGE QUALITY, RESULTING IN LONGER EXAM TIMES, HIGHER UCA DOSAGE, AND POTENTIALLY MISSED TARGETS. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A NEW REAL-TIME FREEHAND UMI APPROACH BASED ON DEEP LEARNING TO ACHIEVE EXCELLENT DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER. A SPATIOTEMPORAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO SPECICALLY DETECT ADHERENT UCAS, WHICH INDICATE DISEASE, IN REAL-TIME WHILE SUPPRESSING BACKGROUND NOISE FROM TISSUE AND FREE UCAS. A PHYSICS- DRIVEN SIMULATOR OF BREAST UMI WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND CALIBRATED WITH PHANTOM AND WATER TANK MEASUREMENTS. A DATABASE OF SIMULATED UMI TIME SERIES WILL BE ASSEMBLED AND USED TO TRAIN THE SPATIOTEMPORAL CNN TO IDENTIFY ADHERENT UCAS. FINALLY, THE CNN WILL BE DEPLOYED ON A PROTOTYPE REAL-TIME FREEHAND UMI SYSTEM, OPERATING IN EXCESS OF 30 FRAMES PER SECOND. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE TESTED IN A UMI STUDY OF BREAST CANCER DETECTION IN A TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL. THIS STUDY WILL USE UCAS TARGETED TO A NOVEL BIOMARKER (B7-H3) THAT IS HIGHLY SPECIC FOR CANCER AND IS BELIEVED TO CORRELATE STRONGLY WITH LIKELIHOOD OF PROGRESSION TO INVASIVE BREAST CANCER. THE REAL-TIME FREEHAND APPROACH IS SIGNICANT BECAUSE IT ENABLES THE OPERATOR TO FREELY INTERROGATE (AND REVISIT) MULTIPLE TARGETS WITH A SINGLE UCA INJECTION, REDUCING EXAM TIMES AND UCA DOSAGE. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT USES CNNS TO BETTER UTILIZE DATA THAT IS ALREADY ACQUIRED DURING UMI. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT BREAST CANCER WITH HIGH IMAGE QUALITY USING REAL-TIME FREEHAND UMI OF B7-H3, POTENTIALLY REDUCING FALSE POSITIVES AND OVERDIAGNOSIS AND THUS UNNECESSARY TESTS, BIOPSIES, COSTS, AND PATIENT DISTRESS. THE K99 PHASE WILL PROVIDE DEDICATED TRAINING AND CAREER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN MOLECULAR IMAGING, UCA SYNTHE- SIS AND TARGETING, ANIMAL STUDY DESIGN, SMALL ANIMAL UMI, CLINICAL UMI, AND OTHER DEDICATED PREPARATION NEEDED TO TRANSITION TO A FACULTY POSITION AND AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH CAREER STUDYING IMAGING METHODS FOR UMI.

OF THE BRAIN. ATTAINING THESE GOALS WILL REQUIRE DIDACTIC TRAINING AND RESEARCH GUIDANCE. RESEARCH WE WILL DEVELOP NEW METHODOLOGY TO IMPROVE WHOLE-BRAIN DYNAMIC CONNECTIVITY ANALYSES OF NORMAL AND ABNORMAL BRAIN FUNCTION, WHICH IS VITAL FOR UNDERSTANDING VARIOUS BRAIN DISORDERS, SUCH AS ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE, AND MAY HELP IDENTIFY BIOMARKERS AND INFORM EARLY PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. PREVIOUS STUDIES ARE LARGELY BASED ON ONE AVERAGE NETWORK CONSTRUCTED USING DATA FROM AN ENTIRE BRAIN SCAN (I.E., STATIC CONNECTIVITY), BUT EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS NETWORK TOPOLOGY EXHIBITS MEANINGFUL VARIATIONS ON THE SECOND TO MINUTE SCALE, CREATING A GAP IN UNDERSTANDING UNLESS THESE VARIATIONS ARE QUANTIFIED. WHILE SEVERAL METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THIS NEW DIRECTION IN THE FIELD, THERE DOES NOT YET EXIST A UNIFYING FRAMEWORK THAT ACCURATELY ESTIMATES WHOLE-BRAIN NETWORKS, AS WELL AS THE DYNAMICS OF NETWORK CHANGE ACROSS A FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI) EXPERIMENT, WHILE A) ACCOUNTING FOR VARIABLES OF INTEREST AND MOTION- INDUCED ARTIFACTS AND B) ALLOWING FOR INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES OF DYNAMICS. THE NOVEL METHODS PROPOSED HERE WILL ADDRESS THESE NEEDS AND PROVIDE A SET OF TOOLS FOR FUTURE DYNAMIC BRAIN NETWORK ANALYSIS RESEARCH. THIS RESEARCH, ALONG WITH MY PROPOSED TRAINING PLAN, WILL FACILITATE MY PROGRESSION TOWARD BECOMING AN INDEPENDENT NEUROIMAGING STATISTICIAN WITH EXPERTISE IN BRAIN NETWORK ANALYSIS. TRAINING THE PROPOSED TRAINING PROGRAM INVOLVES FOUR COMPONENTS: 1) CAREER GUIDANCE AND NEUROSCIENCE AND NETWORK ANALYSIS TRAINING FROM A MENTORING COMMITTEE; 2) AN EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT TO ESTABLISH FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE AND IMAGE ANALYSIS; 3) PERFORMING INNOVATIVE RESEARCH USING THE SKILLS GAINED FROM THE PROPOSED TRAINING PLAN AND; 4) PARTICIPATING IN THE EXCHANGE OF KNOWLEDGE AND IDEAS WITH OTHER STATISTICIANS AND NEUROSCIENTISTS THROUGH WORKSHOPS, CONFERENCES, SEMINAR SERIES, AND JOURNAL CLUBS. THE TRAINING WILL ENABLE ME TO SHIFT FROM AN EARLY CAREER STATISTICIAN TO AN ESTABLISHED, INDEPENDENT, NEUROIMAGING STATISTICIAN WITH EXPERTISE IN WHOLE-BRAIN NETWORK ANALYSES. THE TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE AND IMAGE ANALYSIS WILL ALLOW ME TO BECOME A MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM SCIENTIST DEDICATED TO STUDYING THE HUMAN BRAIN. THE GROWTH GAINED THROUGH THIS 5-YEAR PERIOD WILL LEAD TO A SKILL SET, AND A CONFIDENCE, THAT ALLOWS ME TO BE MORE WELL-VERSED IN THE NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOLOGY BEHIND THE DATA I AM ANALYZING.

GENE DELIVERY USING ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS (AAV) VECTORS HAS DEMONSTRATED IMMENSE POTENTIAL FOR TREATMENT OF CONGENITAL AND ACQUIRED DISEASES IMPACTING THE CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS. ADVANCING MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF VECTOR UPTAKE AND TRAFFICKING WITHIN NERVOUS SYSTEM CELLS WOULD INFORM VIRAL VECTOR CAPSID DESIGN. HERETOFORE, VISUALIZING VIRAL VECTOR CELLULAR TRANSDUCTION IN VIVO HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY A LACK OF OPTIMAL MEANS FOR RESOLVING NANOSCALE PARTICLES IN THICK TISSUES. IMAGING VIRAL PARTICLES WHOSE DIMENSIONS ARE BELOW THE ~250 NM DIFFRACTION LIMIT RESOLUTION OF LIGHT MICROSCOPY IS TYPICALLY ACHIEVED USING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, A RESOURCE-INTENSIVE TECHNIQUE INCOMPATIBLE WITH LIFE. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO DEVELOP INTRAVITAL IMAGING TECHNIQUES THAT ENABLE HIGH-SPEED AND DEEP NANOSCALE IMAGING OF LIVING SYSTEMS. TWO- PHOTON EXCITATION (2PE) MICROSCOPY IS A POWERFUL TECHNIQUE FOR INTRAVITAL IMAGING OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT EMPLOYS ULTRAFAST NEAR-INFRARED LASER LIGHT CAPABLE OF PENETRATING DEEP INTO TISSUES. THOUGH THE TECHNIQUE ENABLES INTRAVITAL IMAGING OF THICK TISSUES, THE ACHIEVABLE RESOLUTION AND IMAGE QUALITY OF 2PE MICROSCOPY IS INADEQUATE FOR STUDY OF NANOSCALE PROCESSES. 2PE MICROSCOPY MAY BE PAIRED WITH STIMULATED EMISSION DEPLETION (STED) TECHNIQUES TO ENABLE RESOLUTION OF NANOSCALE FLUORESCENT-TAGGED TARGETS. TO ENHANCE IMAGING DEPTH AND SIGNAL-TO-BACKGROUND, 2PE MAY BE ACHIEVED VIA SPATIOTEMPORAL OVERLAP OF TWO ULTRAFAST LASERS OF DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS IN A PROCESS TERMED NON-DEGENERATE 2PE. HERETOFORE, WIDE DISSEMINATION OF 2PE-STED AND NON-DEGENERATE 2PE MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY THE COST AND COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH SYNCHRONIZATION AND ALIGNMENT OF TWO ULTRAFAST LASER SOURCES. HEREIN, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT SUPER-RESOLVED MULTIPHOTON MICROSCOPY APPROACHES TO ENHANCE SPATIOTEMPORAL RESOLUTION AND IMAGING DEPTH WITHIN LIVING TISSUES BY EMPLOYING A SINGLE DUAL-OUTPUT COMMERCIAL ULTRAFAST LASER. ONCE DEVELOPED, WE WILL EMPLOY THESE NOVEL IMAGING PLATFORMS TO STUDY INTRACELLULAR TRAFFICKING OF SINGLE AAV PARTICLES WITHIN CELLS OF THE MURINE NERVOUS SYSTEM. IN AIM 1, THE DUAL-OUTPUT ULTRAFAST LASER WILL BE UTILIZED TO ACHIEVE 2PE-STED MICROSCOPY VIA PULSED DEPLETION AND EMPLOYED TO IMAGE AAV TRAFFICKING IN CULTURED SCHWANN CELLS AND PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS OF MURINE DORSAL ROOT GANGLIA. IN AIM 2, THE DUAL-OUTPUT ULTRAFAST LASER WILL BE UTILIZED TO ACHIEVE NON-DEGENERATE 2PE AND PAIRED WITH A CONTINUOUS WAVE DEPLETION BEAM FOR DEEP SUPER-RESOLUTION IMAGING OF AAV TRAFFICKING IN CORNEAL SCHWANN CELLS AND SENSORY NEURONS IN LIVE ANESTHETIZED MICE. A LIQUID LENS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO ENHANCE VOLUMETRIC IMAGING SPEED.

THE SUCCESS OF BRACHYTHERAPY HEAVILY RELIES ON SAFE AND PRECISE PLACEMENT OF THE SEEDS IN OR ADJACENT TO THE CANCEROUS CELLS. THE PROCEDURE DEMANDS A VERY EXPERIENCED SURGEON WHO HAVE DEVELOPED AN INTUITIVE FEEL IN NEEDLE INSERTIONS AND IS ABLE TO GUIDE THE NEEDLE INTO A DESIRED LOCATION WITH HAND-EYE COORDINATION AND ASSISTANCE OF AN IMAGING DEVICE. HOWEVER, WITH CONVENTIONAL RIGID NEEDLES, ONLY A STRAIGHT PATH IS ACHIEVABLE TOWARDS THE TARGET, AND THEREBY SEED PLACEMENTS REQUIRE SEVERAL INSERTIONS WITH A HIGH TISSUE DAMAGE ON THE NEEDLE\u2019S PATH. A RECENT STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT GUIDING THE NEEDLE IN A CURVILINEAR APPROACH WILL DECREASE THE NUMBER OF NEEDLE INSERTIONS REQUIRED AND PROVIDE OTHER DOSIMETRIC BENEFITS. LACK OF ACTUATION AND CONTROL (AFTER THE NEEDLE IS INSERTED INTO THE PATIENT\u2019S BODY) IS ANOTHER FACTOR THAT MAKE THE PROCEDURE CHALLENGING. A FLEXIBLE 3D STEERABLE \u201cSMART\u201d NEEDLE WITH MULTI-DIRECTIONAL ACTUATION AND A RELIABLE GUIDANCE CONTROL AND GUIDANCE CAN AID THE SURGEON TO PERFORM THE TASK WITH MORE ACCURACY, REDUCED INVASIVENESS, AND IN A CURVILINEAR APPROACH.

ON THE OTHER HAND, IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDLE-TISSUE INTERACTION MECHANISM (WITH INTRAOPERATIVE MODEL PARAMETER UPDATES AND SHAPE- AND FORCE-SENSING) IS A KEY FACTOR IN DEVELOPMENT OF AN APPROPRIATE CONTROL AND GUIDANCE STRATEGIES TO COMPENSATE FOR SYSTEM UNCERTAINTIES. THIS WORK WILL FIRST DEVELOP AN ACTIVE \u201cSMART\u201d BRACHYTHERAPY NEEDLE THAT WILL PROVIDE ROBUST ACTUATION, SHAPE- AND FORCE-SENSING, AND 3D MOTION IN TISSUE. THEN A TELEOPERATIVE INTERFACE WITH ROBOT-DRIVEN SMART NEEDLE WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PERFORM SEMI- AUTOMATED BRACHYTHERAPY. REALISTIC ANALYTICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF NEEDLE-TISSUE INTERACTIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED USING REALISTIC TISSUE CHARACTERISTICS.

COMPUTER VISION (CV) SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE SURGICAL PERFORMANCE. AFTER FORMAL TRAINING, PRACTICING NEUROSURGEONS RECEIVE LITTLE FEEDBACK AND INSTEAD LEARN BY EXPERIENCE ACCRUED DURING PROCEDURES. HOWEVER, MOST DO NOT ACCRUE SUFFICIENT CASE VOLUME TO ACHIEVE OPTIMAL OUTCOMES IN EVERY PROCEDURE. ULTIMATELY, >16,000 PATIENTS ARE HARMED BY PREVENTABLE NEUROSURGICAL ERRORS EACH YEAR, RESULTING IN STROKE AND NEUROLOGIC DISABILITY IN UP TO 70% AND DEATH IN UP TO 16% OF AFFECTED PATIENTS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE STUDY OF HARMFUL ADVERSE EVENTS DURING SURGERY IS OBSTRUCTED BY A LACK OF DATASETS CONTAINING SURGICAL ACTIONS LEADING UP TO ADVERSE EVENTS OR OUTCOMES. THE CANDIDATE PROPOSES TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION BY USING ADVANCED CV AND ML METHODS TO ANALYZE A PREVIOUSLY UNSTUDIED, MULTIMODAL DATASET COMBINING PITUITARY SURGICAL VIDEO AND CLINICAL DATA. PITUITARY SURGERY IS PERFORMED >10,000 TIMES ANNUALLY IN THE U.S., CAN BE RECORDED FOR ANALYSIS, AND ITS STEPS, ERRORS, AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RECENTLY STANDARDIZED IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS STATEMENT. SPECIFICALLY, THE CANDIDATE WILL TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT THE INTERACTION OF VISIBLE SURGEON SKILL FACTORS WITH VISUALIZED FEATURES, INCLUDING PATIENT ANATOMY AND DISEASE PATHOLOGY, PRODUCES IDENTIFIABLE STEP-SPECIFIC SURGICAL ERRORS THAT RESULT IN POSTOPERATIVE STROKE, NEUROLOGIC DISABILITY, AND OTHER ADVERSE EVENTS. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) USE CV TO IDENTIFY STEP-SPECIFIC ERRORS (DEFINED BY TOOL USAGE, STEP PROGRESSION, AND PHASE CHARACTERISTICS) PRECEDING ADVERSE EVENTS; 2) TRAIN ML MODELS TO PREDICT UPCOMING ADVERSE EVENTS FROM PRIOR METRICS OF SURGEON SKILL AND CURRENT VISUAL FEATURES OF THE SURGICAL FIELD. METHODS TO IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK NEUROSURGICAL ACTIONS, PREDICT UPCOMING ADVERSE EVENTS FROM A SURGEON\u2019S MOVEMENTS, AND RETROSPECTIVELY HIGHLIGHT CRITICAL TIMEPOINTS AND VISUAL FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE EVENTS ARE NECESSARY TO RATIONALLY DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE STROKE, NEUROLOGIC DISABILITY, AND OTHER ADVERSE EVENTS.

QAVI CONTINUED HIS MEDICAL TRAINING AS PART OF THE CLINICAL PATHOLOGY PHYSICIAN SCIENTIST TRAINING PROGRAM AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS AND THE BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL CONSORTIUM. DURING HIS RESIDENCY ELECTIVE TIME, HE BEGAN RESEARCH IN THE LABORATORY OF DR. LAN YANG, WHO WILL SERVE AS HIS CO-MENTOR TOGETHER WITH DR. AMARASINGHE. DR. YANG IS THE EDWIN H. AND FLORENCE G.

QAVI ADDED AN ADDITIONAL TRAINING COMPONENT UNDER THE CO-MENTORSHIP WITH DR. GAYA AMARASINGHE, PROFESSOR OF PATHOLOGY & IMMUNOLOGY, TO EXPAND THE APPLICATION OF HIS PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED SENSOR TECHNOLOGY TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE REACH.  THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID, MULTIPLEXED OPTOFLUIDIC SENSOR PLATFORM FOR THE RAPID DETECTION OF PATHOGENS, WITH AN INITIAL FOCUS ON EBOLA. FILOVIRUSES, SUCH AS EBOLA, ARE AMONG THE MOST LETHAL HUMAN PATHOGENS, WITH HIGH CASE FATALITY RATES DURING OUTBREAKS. CRITICAL IN THE IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF OUTBREAKS ARE ROBUST DETECTION METHODS THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED RAPIDLY AND SENSITIVELY. TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL NEED, WHISPERING GALLERY MODE (WGM) SENSORS WILL BE LEVERAGED. WGM DEVICES ARE A CLASS OF OPTICAL SENSORS IN WHICH LIGHT IS CONFINED WITHIN A MICRON-SCALE VOLUME. THESE DEVICES HAVE INCREDIBLY HIGH SENSITIVITY, SMALL SENSOR FOOTPRINT, EASE OF INTEGRATION WITH CONVENTIONAL ELECTRONICS, AND LOW FABRICATION COSTS. MICROBUBBLE RESONATORS (MBRS), A SUBCLASS OF WGM SENSORS, OFFER THE ADVANTAGES OF CONVENTIONAL WGM DEVICES WHILE ENABLING COUPLING OF OPTICAL AND THE FLUIDIC COMPONENTS INTO A SINGLE COMPONENT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE USE OF AN OPTOFLUIDIC SENSOR PLATFORM BASED ON MBRS FOR THE RAPID, MULTIPLEXED DETECTION OF EBOLA.

DESPITE THIS RAPID ACCELERATION OF TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT, THE PROTECTION OF THESE SYSTEMS FROM ADVERSARIES SUCH AS MALICIOUS HACKERS (A PRACTICE WHICH CONSTITUTES THE DISCIPLINE OF CYBERSECURITY) HAS NOT MATCHED THE PACE AND UBIQUITY OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. CYBER ATTACKS ON HEALTHCARE HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY, RESULTING IN MANY PUBLIC EXAMPLES OF COMPROMISED CLINICAL CARE, LOST REVENUE, AND BREACHES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, A VAST MAJORITY OF THE NASCENT HEALTHCARE CYBERSECURITY LITERATURE FOCUSES ON THE PROTECTION OF PATIENT HEALTH DATA, AND IGNORES THE RISKS CYBER ATTACKS POSE TO PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. THE LONG TERM GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CYBER ATTACKS ON PATIENT OUTCOMES INCLUDING MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO IDENTIFY WHICH CLINICAL WORKFLOWS, MEDICAL DEVICES, SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, AND OTHER DIGITIZED HOSPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE PRESENT THE GREATEST POTENTIAL HARM TO PATIENTS WHEN INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY CYBER ATTACKS ARE USED BY MALICIOUS HACKERS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT DATA-DRIVEN MODELS OF CYBER ATTACKS ON HEALTHCARE CAN IDENTIFY PROCESSES AND CLINICAL WORKFLOWS MOST VULNERABLE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACTING PATIENT OUTCOMES. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROJECT IS THAT ITS MODELS WILL HELP CREATE A FOUNDATIONAL BASE OF HEALTHCARE CYBERSECURITY KNOWLEDGE, WITHOUT WHICH TARGETS IN NEED OF INCREASED CYBERSECURITY MEASURES WILL REMAIN UNKNOWN. THE ACQUISITION OF THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL CHANGE THE HEALTHCARE SECURITY PARADIGM TO INCLUDE BOTH A MORE HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF CYBERSECURITY RISKS BUT ALSO ONE THAT CONSIDERS THE PATIENT SAFETY AND OUTCOME IMPACTS OF CYBER ATTACKS. THIS PROJECT HAS TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) DEVELOP HEALTHCARE CYBER ATTACK MODELS WHERE THE INTEGRITY OF PATIENT DATA HAS BEEN COMPROMISED; AND (2) DEVELOP HEALTHCARE CYBER ATTACK MODELS WHERE THE AVAILABILITY OF CRITICAL TECHNICAL SYSTEMS ARE IMPACTED. THE FIRST AIM WILL UTILIZE MICROSIMULATION TO MODEL PATIENT CARE IN A HOSPITAL UNDERGOING INTEGRITY CYBER ATTACKS THAT MALICIOUSLY MODIFY DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC DATA. THE SECOND AIM WILL ALSO UTILIZE MICROSIMULATION BUT WILL MODEL THE CARE OF PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS UNDERGOING AVAILABILITY CYBER ATTACKS SUCH AS RANSOMWARE WHICH RENDER CERTAIN TECHNICAL SYSTEMS INOPERABLE. BOTH AIMS WILL MODEL THE CARE OF PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH STROKE, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, AND SEPSIS.

CHARACTERIZATION FOR BREAST CANCER SCREENING USING TRANSMISSION AND REFLECTION ULTRASOUND TOMOGRAPHY - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  BREAST CANCER IS THE MOST DIAGNOSED CANCER IN WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE MOST COMMONLY OCCURRING CANCER WORLDWIDE ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. THE PRIMARY SCREENING METHOD FOR NON-PALPABLE BREAST CANCERS IS X-RAY MAMMOGRAPHY, WHICH USES IONIZING RADIATION AND OFTEN HAS LOW SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY IN DENSE BREASTS. ULTRASOUND TOMOGRAPHY OFFERS A LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE TO X-RAY MAMMOGRAPHY THAT CAN IMAGE THE BREAST BASED ON ITS ACOUSTIC PROPERTIES AND ENABLE EARLY CANCER DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS, WHILE AVOIDING THE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL EFFECTS OF IONIZING RADIATION. CURRENTLY, ULTRASOUND TOMOGRAPHY OF THE BREAST GENERALLY RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE TRANSMISSION OF ULTRASOUND THROUGH THE TISSUE TO RECONSTRUCT UNDERLYING TISSUE PROPERTIES SUCH AS SOUND SPEED AND ATTENUATION. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE IS THE SIMULTANEOUS MODELING OF SIGNALS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE TISSUE AND SIGNALS REFLECTED FROM THE TISSUE TO ESTIMATE THESE TISSUE PROPERTIES. COMBINING TRANSMISSION AND REFLECTION INFORMATION FROM AN ULTRASOUND TOMOGRAPHY SYSTEM WILL ENABLE ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF DIFFICULT-TO-MEASURE TISSUE PROPERTIES SUCH AS THE MASS DENSITY. FURTHERMORE, THE ADDITION OF REFLECTION INFORMATION MAY ENABLE TISSUE CHARACTERIZATION IN ACOUSTICALLY CHALLENGING CASES WHERE TRANSMISSION INFORMATION IS LESS RELIABLE (E.G., TRANSMISSION THROUGH BONE, PARTIAL ANGLE TOMOGRAPHY). I PROPOSE TO IMPROVE THE ROBUSTNESS OF ULTRASOUND TRANSMISSION TOMOGRAPHY BY INCORPORATING REFLECTION INFORMATION AND ENABLE THE ESTIMATION OF MASS DENSITY.  IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE ULTRASOUND TOMOGRAPHY SYSTEM I AIM TO: EXTEND TRANSMISSION TOMOGRAPHY TO THREE DIMENSION IN ORDER ACCOUNT FOR OUT-OF-PLANE SCATTERING (AIM 1); DEVELOP ALGORITHMS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY RECONSTRUCT THE SOUND SPEED, ACOUSTIC ATTENUATION, AND MASS DENSITY OF TISSUE USING THE COMPLETE TRANSMISSION AND REFLECTION INFORMATION ACQUIRED BY AN ULTRASOUND TOMOGRAPHY SYSTEM (AIM 2); AND DEVELOP SOUND SPEED RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS SOLELY BASED ON THE REFLECTED ULTRASOUND SIGNAL, WHICH WILL ALSO BENEFIT THE APPLICATIONS OF HANDHELD PULSE-ECHO ULTRASOUND (AIM 3). THESE AIMS WILL IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ACOUSTIC MODELS APPLICABLE TO ULTRASOUND SIGNALS IN BOTH TRANSMISSION AND REFLECTION AS WELL AS HOW THESE MODELS MAY BE INVERTED TO RECONSTRUCT ACCURATE AND SPATIALLY RESOLVED IMAGES OF TISSUE PROPERTIES. EXPANDING THE TISSUE CHARACTERIZATION CAPABILITIES OF ULTRASOUND TOMOGRAPHY WILL ENABLE A MULTI-PARAMETRIC APPROACH FOR THE DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BREAST CANCER USING A NON-IONIZING RADIATION IMAGING MODALITY. IMPROVING THE ROBUSTNESS OF ULTRASOUND TOMOGRAPHY IN ACOUSTICALLY CHALLENGING CASES WILL ALSO ENABLE CANCER DETECTION OUTSIDE OF THE BREAST AND MAY FURTHER ENABLE DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER METASTASIS.

UNFORTUNATELY, MENTAL DISORDERS ARE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE, MONITOR, AND TREAT. REPEATED TRIGGERING OF DAILY STRESS CAN ALSO LEAD TO CHRONIC STRESS, ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RISKS OF MENTAL DISORDERS, WEAKENING IMMUNERESPONSE, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. DESPITE THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO CARE SCARCELY BEGIN TO MEET THE NEED. MOREOVER, THERE ARE NO OBJECTIVE TESTS OR SCALABLE TECHNOLOGIES FOR DETECTING CHRONIC STRESS. TO ADVANCE PRECISION MENTAL HEALTHCARE, WE NEED CONTINUOUS, PREDICTIVE, AND QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF MENTAL STATES FOR STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. WEARABLE DEVICES CAN TRANSFORM MENTAL HEALTH CARE DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO MONITOR PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE BIODATA. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LIMITED WEARABLE DEVICES DESIGNED FOR MENTAL HEALTH MONITORING. IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, I WILL TACKLE THE MENTIONED PROBLEMS IN MENTAL HEALTH MONITORING BY DEVELOPING PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES BASED ON SKIN-LIKE WEARABLE BIOSENSORS. THE FOCUS OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO CREATE A SOFT AND WEARABLE BIOSENSOR THAT CAN MEASURE MULTIPLE MENTAL HEALTH BIOMARKERS WIRELESSLY IN REAL-TIME, PROVIDING QUANTIFIABLE METRICS TO ASSIST DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, MONITORING, AND PREVENTION OF MENTAL DISORDERS. TWO NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE DEVELOPED: A SOFT AND WIRELESS PATCH TO MEASURE MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED PHYSICAL BIOMARKERS ON THE SKIN AND A NEW ORGANIC BIOSENSOR PLATFORM TO MONITOR CHEMICAL BIOMARKERS IN SWEAT. FIRST, I WILL DESIGN A SOFT AND WIRELESS SENSOR PATCH TO MONITOR SKIN CONDUCTANCE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO ACUTE STRESSORS AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM. THE DESIGNED SKIN CONDUCTANCE SENSOR PATCH, COMPOSED OF INTRINSICALLY STRETCHABLE AND SOFT MATERIALS, WILL PROVIDE SEAMLESS INTEGRATION WITH SKIN AND ACCURATE MEASUREMENT WITH HIGH SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS. SECOND, I WILL FABRICATE A SOFT CHEMICAL BIOSENSOR TO MONITOR THE STRESS HORMONE IN SWEAT USING ORGANIC FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS. A HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SELECTIVE APTAMER CHEMICAL BIOSENSOR WILL BE UTILIZED IN A SKIN-LIKE ORGANIC MATERIAL SYSTEM.

SENSITIVE DETECTION OF NUCLEIC ACID TARGETS HAS BEEN READILY ACHIEVED BY EXPLOITING WATSON-CRICK BASE PAIRING TO AMPLIFY SIGNALS (PCR, LAMP, CAS9, ETC.), BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF INNOVATION FOR DETECTION OF LOW CONCENTRATION ANTIGENS AND SMALL MOLECULES AT THE POINT OF CARE. BIOLOGY HAS EVOLVED INTRICATE MECHANISMS FOR RAPIDLY AMPLIFYING PROTEIN SIGNALS IN VIVO VIA POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION AND PROTEIN BASED SIGNALING NETWORKS. TOWARDS THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING NOVEL, RAPID, ULTRASENSITIVE DIAGNOSTICS, THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT IN VITRO, PROTEIN-BASED SIGNALING NETWORKS INCORPORATING SELF- AMPLIFYING ENZYMATIC PATHWAYS WILL RESULT IN BIOMARKER DETECTION PLATFORMS WITH UNPARALLELED SENSING CAPABILITIES. SPECIFICALLY, WE PLAN TO INVESTIGATE TWO MECHANISMS OF PROTEIN SIGNALING NETWORKS WITH POTENTIAL FOR DIAGNOSTICS: SPLIT ENZYME RECONSTITUTION AND AUTOCATALYTIC POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS. FIRST, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE IN VITRO USE OF SPLIT ADENYLATE CYCLASE FOR SMALL MOLECULE DETECTION. DETECTION OF THE ANALYTE WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE SIMULTANEOUSLY BINDING TWO PROTEINS (I.E. A SANDWICH ASSAY IN SOLUTION), BRINGING TWO HALVES OF ADENYLATE CYCLASE TOGETHER AND PRODUCING CAMP. SECOND, WE WILL INVESTIGATE FUSIONS OF SPLIT ADENYLATE CYCLASE AND CAMP RECEPTOR PROTEIN TO CREATE AN AUTOCATALYTIC FEEDBACK LOOP IN VITRO. THIS LOOP WILL RESPOND TO CAMP BY PRODUCING MORE CAMP. FINALLY, WE WILL DEVELOP ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION-BASED MODELS TO UNDERSTAND AND ENGINEER DIAGNOSTIC PROPERTIES. DYNAMIC MODELS OF THESE PROTEIN-SIGNALING NETWORKS WILL BE INFORMED BY MEASURED EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS. THESE MODELS WILL BE USED TO CREATE A COMBINED MODEL FOR A HIGH SENSITIVITY, FAST SMALL MOLECULE SENSOR AS A PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE FOR FUTURE WORK. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS SYSTEM WOULD BE BROADLY APPLICABLE FOR PROTEIN AND SMALL MOLECULE DETECTION AND COULD BE USED TO DETECT A WIDE RANGE OF TARGET ANALYTES WITH KNOWN ANTIBODY BINDING DOMAINS.

CURRENT THERAPEUTIC CELLS ONLY RESPOND IN A BINARY WAY TO RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF A TRANSIENT SIGNAL; FURTHER, GENE THERAPIES DELIVER ONLY ONE GENETIC ELEMENT TO CELLS, WHICH LIMITS THEIR ABILITIES TO PERFORM COMPLEX FUNCTIONS AND THUS THEIR APPLICABILITY. DEVELOPING NEW TYPES OF CELL SYSTEMS THAT CAN RESPOND TO DIVERSE BIOMARKERS AND ENACT MULTIPLE, INDEPENDENTLY REGULATED CIRCUIT ELEMENTS IS CRITICAL FOR EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF CELL THERAPIES.  THE WORK PROPOSED HERE AIMS TO DESIGN NOVEL SENSORS, INSULATOR ELEMENTS, AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELS IN THE CONTEXT OF CREATING SYSTEMS TO MODULATE INFLAMMATION, PRIMARILY BECAUSE CHRONIC INFLAMMATION HAS A PROMINENT ROLE IN THE PROGRESSION OF MULTIPLE DISEASES. ONE ASPECT OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL EXPLORE WAYS THAT CELLS CAN INTEGRATE INFLAMMATORY SIGNALS OVER EXTENDED TIME PERIODS AND HOW CELLS DIFFERENTIALLY RESPOND BASED ON THE TOTAL SIGNAL EXPERIENCED. THE RESULTING ENGINEERED CELL SENSORS COULD SERVE AS A BASIS FOR DEVELOPING THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND OTHER DISEASES WITH TIME-DEPENDENT BIOMARKERS. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL EXPLORE WAYS THAT GENETIC INSULATORS AND ANTI-SILENCING METHODS CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO SYNTHETIC CIRCUITS. INCORPORATING MULTIPLE, DIFFERENTIALLY-REGULATED GENETIC ELEMENTS ONTO SINGLE CIRCUITS IS CHALLENGING, AS EUKARYOTIC TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS CAN ACT ACROSS LONG DISTANCES. DETERMINING A SET OF INSULATORS THAT DO NOT CROSS-REACT WITH OTHERS WILL HELP TO CREATE A GENERALIZABLE FRAMEWORK FOR USING INSULATORS IN COMPLEX GENETIC CIRCUITS, AND HELP TO ENABLE THE CREATION OF MORE COMPLEX GENETIC CIRCUITS. FURTHER, SINCE EPIGENETIC SILENCING DECREASES THE ACTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF GENE THERAPIES OVER TIME, INVESTIGATING WAYS TO REDUCE SILENCING\u2014THROUGH INSULATORS AND OTHER GENETIC MODIFICATIONS\u2014WILL HELP TO CREATE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE LONGEVITY OF CELL AND GENE THERAPIES. THE INVESTIGATION WILL ALSO USE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING TO EXPLORE THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN RESPONSIVE SYNTHETIC CELLS AND PHARMACOKINETICS. THE MODEL WILL INCORPORATE INFLAMMATORY CELL SIGNALING, SYNTHETIC ANTIBODY PRODUCTION, AND SYSTEMS-LEVEL DISTRIBUTION TO GUIDE THE DESIGN OF THERAPEUTIC CELLS THAT MODULATE INFLAMMATION.

CLINICAL TOOL, REVOLUTIONIZING HOW THE RADIOTHERAPY (RT) TEAM CAN VIEW TREATMENTS. RT HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED A \u201cBLIND\u201d PROCEDURE SINCE CLINICAL RADIATION BEAMS ARE INVISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE. HOWEVER, AS PATIENTS ARE IRRADIATED WITH X-RAYS OR ELECTRONS, A LOW LIGHT SIGNAL IS GENERATED WITHIN THEIR TISSUE, CALLED THE \u201cCHERENKOV EFFECT\u201d, AND THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF RADIATION DOSE DELIVERED. AT DARTMOUTH, THE OPTICS IN MEDICINE LABORATORY HAS DEVELOPED A WAY TO IMAGE THIS LIGHT SIGNAL ON THE SURFACE OF A PATIENT DURING RT, TRANSFORMING RT TO NO LONGER BE A \u201cBLIND\u201d PROCEDURE. THIS NOVEL IMAGING TOOL LENDS ITSELF TO MANY PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A NON-CONTACT, PASSIVE, WHOLE SURFACE DOSIMETRY TOOL FOLLOWING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHERENKOV EMISSION AND DOSE DEPOSITION. HOWEVER, MANY FACTORS INFLUENCE THIS RELATIONSHIP AND MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR BEFORE THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IS MELANIN CONCENTRATION. WE KNOW THAT HIGHER MELANIN CONCENTRATIONS FOUND IN DARK-SKINNED PATIENTS CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT SIGNAL BY NEARLY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE COMPARED TO LIGHT-SKINNED PATIENTS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LIMITED PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS AT DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK HEALTH (DHH), THE TEAM HAS NOT IMAGED DARK SKIN PATIENTS AND ANY DEVELOPMENT THUS FAR HAS BEEN MADE WITH THE PREDOMINANT LIGHT-SKINNED POPULATION IN THE CATCHMENT AREA. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT ARE TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE A DIVERSE PATIENT DATA SET REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COUNTRY AND DEVELOP A SKIN COLOR CALIBRATION ALGORITHM FOR CLINICAL CHERENKOV IMAGING, WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF TRANSFORMING CHERENKOV IMAGING INTO AN INCLUSIVE DOSIMETRY TOOL THAT WORKS FOR ALL PATIENTS.

IODINE AND BARIUM-BASED CONTRAST AGENTS ARE CURRENTLY USED IN THE CLINIC FOR GIT IMAGING WITH CT. HOWEVER, THESE CONTRAST AGENTS ARE NOT SPECIFIC FOR INFLAMMATION SITES, LIMITING THEIR DIAGNOSTIC UTILITY FOR IBD IMAGING. THUS, THERE IS A COMPELLING NEED TO DEVELOP NOVEL CT CONTRAST AGENTS FOR THIS APPLICATION. CERIUM IS A POTENTIAL ELEMENT TO USE FOR NOVEL CONTRAST AGENTS DUE TO ITS STRONG CT CONTRAST GENERATION. DESPITE THIS, CERIUM CONTRAST AGENTS HAVE RARELY BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR CT IMAGING. ASIDE FROM THE EXCELLENT X-RAY CONTRAST, CERIUM POSSESSES IMPORTANT PROPERTIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF IBD.  CURRENT MANAGEMENT OF IBD RELIES ON NONSPECIFIC IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPIES (SUCH AS STEROIDS), ANTIBIOTICS, AND BIOLOGICALLY TARGETING THE PRO-INFLAMMATORY TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR PATHWAY. HOWEVER, THESE TREATMENTS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE IN ALL PATIENTS AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS, AS THE EFFECTS OF THESE TREATMENTS ARE NOT LONG TERM.

OF ENDOGENOUS SUBSTRATES OF E3 UBIQUITIN LIGASES AND MOLECULAR GLUE DEGRADERS - PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT: THE E1-E2-E3 LIGASE CASCADE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TAGGING SUBSTRATE PROTEINS WITH UBIQUITIN. ADDITION OF UBIQUITIN THEN DIRECTS THE TAGGED PROTEIN ALONG ONE OF SEVERAL PATHS, INCLUDING MARKING IT FOR PROTEASOME-MEDIATED DEGRADATION. THE E3 LIGASE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RECOGNITION OF SUBSTRATE PROTEINS, AND THUS ENCODES THE SPECIFICITY OF UBIQUITIN TRANSFER. THE HUMAN PROTEOME COMPRISES ABOUT 600 KNOWN E3 LIGASES, EACH WITH A DISTINCT SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY THAT ALLOWS IT TO ENGAGE A PRESCRIBED SUBSET OF THE PROTEOME. GIVEN THAT ONE OF THE PROTOTYPICAL CONSEQUENCES OF UBIQUITINATION IS TO MARK A PROTEIN FOR DESTRUCTION, IT IS UNSURPRISING THAT DYSREGULATION OR MUTATION OF E3 LIGASES CAN LEAD TO A DISRUPTION OF CELLULAR HOMEOSTATIC BALANCE: ACCORDINGLY, E3 LIGASES HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DISEASES INCLUDING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND CANCER. INTRIGUINGLY, CERTAIN DISEASE-ASSOCIATED MUTATIONS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO ALTER THE SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY OF AN E3 LIGASE \u2013 THESE MUTATIONS NOT ONLY IMPACT THE CELLULAR LEVELS OF PROTEINS WITHIN THE E3\u2019S NORMAL INTERACTOME, BUT RATHER THEY CHANGE THE E3 LIGASE\u2019S INTERACTOME. SIMILAR EFFECTS HAVE ALSO BEEN OBSERVED FROM CERTAIN SMALL MOLECULES, TERMED MOLECULAR GLUES, THAT ALSO MODIFY THE SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY OF AN E3 LIGASE: THESE COMPOUNDS TYPICALLY REDIRECT AN E3 LIGASE TO UBIQUITINATE SOME \u201cNEO-SUBSTRATE\u201d, ULTIMATELY LEADING TO DEGRADATION OF THIS PROTEIN. THUS, MOLECULAR GLUES AFFORD THE POSSIBILITY OF TARGETING DISEASE-CAUSING PROTEINS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE UNDRUGGABLE. TO DATE, HOWEVER, THE TRANSIENT NATURE OF E3 LIGASE\u2019S INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR SUBSTRATES (AND NEO-SUBSTRATES) HAS SERVED AS A BOTTLENECK FOR IDENTIFYING BOTH ENDOGENOUS AND \u201cGLUE-ABLE\u201d SUBSTRATES OF E3 LIGASES. TO ADDRESS THIS, HERE I PROPOSE TO DEVELOP CUTTING-EDGE STRUCTURE-BASED MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO (1) COMPUTATIONALLY IDENTIFY ENDOGENOUS SUBSTRATES OF E3 LIGASES, AND (2) RATIONALLY DESIGN MOLECULAR GLUES THAT DEGRADE A TRADITIONALLY UNDRUGGABLE TARGET PROTEIN. AFTER CAREFULLY BENCHMARKING THE UNDERLYING METHODS FOR EACH TASK, I WILL APPLY THE FORMER TO COMPREHENSIVELY CATALOG SUBSTRATES OF THREE SPECIFIC DISEASE-RELEVANT E3 LIGASES. IN PARALLEL, I WILL APPLY MY APPROACH FOR THE LATTER TO DESIGN MOLECULAR GLUES INTENDED TO DEGRADE ADAR1, A KEY PROTEIN THAT PROMOTES RESISTANCE TO IMMUNE CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE THERAPY AND IS THUS A POTENTIAL TARGET FOR INTERVENTION IN MANY DIFFERENT CANCERS. BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE SCOPE OF THIS PROPOSAL, I ANTICIPATE THAT THE METHODS DEVELOPED THROUGH THESE STUDIES WILL HELP ILLUMINATE THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY OF MANY OTHER E3 LIGASES, AND WILL FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT OF MOLECULAR GLUE DEGRADERS TARGETING KEY DRIVERS IN MANY OTHER DISEASES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations":
