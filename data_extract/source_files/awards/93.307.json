DELAWARE IS AN IDEAL STATE FOR A HEALTH DISPARITIES-FOCUSED RESEARCH CENTER AS IT REPRESENTS THE WHOLE OF THE USA IN A COMPACT FORM. THE POPULATION OF DELAWARE (~978,000) MIRRORS THE US POPULATION IN RATIOS OF URBAN-TO-RURAL, OLD TO YOUNG, AND ETHNIC/RACIAL DIVERSITY. THUS, STUDIES INVOLVING A CROSS-SECTION OF DELAWARE ARE EASILY GENERALIZABLE TO THE NATIONAL POPULATION. IN ADDITION, DELAWARE IS RANKED 35TH OUT OF THE 50 STATES FOR OVERALL HEALTH OUTCOMES, A LOW RANKING THAT REFLECTS HIGH DISPARITIES IN HEALTH STATUS FOR LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY POPULATIONS.  THE URGENCY TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES IN DELAWARE IS CLEAR, AND PROMOTING HEALTH EQUITY THROUGH A SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH APPROACH IS A STATE PRIORITY.

THE PROPOSAL DEVELOPS A VALID METRIC TO ESTIMATE THE TRUE VIRAL INCIDENCE AND NATURALLY/VACCINE-ACQUIRED IMMUNITY PREVALENCE IN THE COMMUNITY, EXAMINE THE HEALTH DISPARITIES AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY, AND MONITOR THE EPIDEMIC OVER TIME AS AN OPERATIONAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. THE APPROACH COLLECTS ROUTINE TESTING DATA ON SARS-COV-2 EXPOSURE AND ANTIBODY SEROPOSITIVITY AMONG PATIENTS IN A HOSPITAL SYSTEM AND PERFORMS STATISTICAL ADJUSTMENTS OF SAMPLE REPRESENTATION USING MULTILEVEL REGRESSION AND POSTSTRATICATION (MRP), WHICH ADJUSTS FOR MEASURED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SAMPLE AND POPULATION AND ALSO YIELDS STABLE SMALL AREA ESTIMATES. THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS PROCEDURE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION TO ENTIRE COMMUNITIES WITH GENERALIZABILITY AND FOCUS ON BURDENS WITHIN SPECIC DEMOGRAPHICS, WITH CLOSE ATTENTION TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ON DISPARITIES ACROSS HEALTH OUTCOMES, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS, AND BEHAVIORS. IN PARTICULAR, THE RESEARCH WILL YIELD GROUP-SPECIC ESTIMATES OF DISPARITIES WITH RESPECT TO ASYMPTOMATIC AND SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS AND HOW THESE DISCREPANCIES MAY IMPACT THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICALLY DEPENDENT SPREAD OF DISEASE AND ITS SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT. THE MRP ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE VIA A WEB INTERFACE AND PROMOTE BROAD INVESTIGATIONS WITH INTEGRATED DATA SOURCES TOWARD A NATIONAL STUDY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1567efcf-bcdb-61b9-72f2-70cbed5fa626-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01MD017867_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160606658, "Award ID": "U01MD017700", "Award Amount": 329607.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-01", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "THE EFFECT OF MEDICAID EXPANSION ON MORTALITY DISPARITIES AND POVERTY - MEDICAID EXPANSION UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHEREIN STATES HAVE THE OPTION TO EXPAND MEDICAID COVERAGE TO ADULTS WITH HOUSEHOLD INCOMES UP TO 138 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE MORTALITY RATES NATIONWIDE. FROM 2014 TO 2018, MORTALITY RATES DROPPED 3.6% MORE IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID THAN THOSE THAT DID NOT. ALTHOUGH THE IMPACT OF MEDICAID EXPANSION ON MORTALITY IS WELL-DOCUMENTED, ITS IMPACT ON MORTALITY DISPARITIES REMAINS UNDEREXAMINED. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICAID EXPANSION AND RURAL-URBAN ETHNORACIAL DISPARITIES, WHILE ALSO ESTIMATING THE MEDIATING ROLE OF POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN THIS RELATIONSHIP. THIS STUDY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT: 1) FOCUSES ON MORTALITY DISPARITY REDUCTION INSTEAD OF THE SIMPLE REDUCTION OF MORTALITY, 2) ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF MEDICAID EXPANSION ON INTERSECTIONAL MORTALITY DISPARITIES, MEANING DISPARITIES FOUND AT THE INTERSECTION OF MULTIPLE HEALTH DISPARITY POPULATIONS (E.G. BLACK AND RURAL), AND 3) IDENTIFIES THE INDIRECT EFFECT OF MEDICAID EXPANSION ON INTERSECTIONAL MORTALITY DISPARITIES THROUGH POVERTY ALLEVIATION. THE INNOVATIONS OF THIS PROJECT CENTER ON THREE CONTRIBUTIONS. FIRST, IT WILL PROVIDE AN EXPLICIT ANALYSIS OF MORTALITY DISPARITY REDUCTION AS OPPOSED TO JUST AGGREGATE IMPACTS ON DIFFERENT GROUPS; SECOND, THE STUDY WILL GENERATE AN UPDATED AND IMPROVED COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE, AS WELL AS COUNTY-LEVEL ESTIMATES OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE. THIRD, THE STUDY WILL PROVIDE A ROBUST ANALYSIS OF THE MEDIATING ROLE OF POVERTY IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICAID EXPANSION AND INTERSECTIONAL MORTALITY DISPARITY REDUCTION. THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED THROUGH THREE SPECIFICS AIMS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF MEDICAID EXPANSION ON ETHNORACIAL MORTALITY DISPARITIES BY RURAL-URBAN STATUS FROM 2011 TO 2019. WE WILL DO SO USING TIME- VARYING DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE DESIGN WITH MARGINAL PREDICTION ANALYSIS VIA CENSUS DATA AND RESTRICTED DATA FROM THE NATIONAL VITAL STATISTICS SYSTEM. IN AIM 2, WE WILL IMPROVE THE COST-OF- LIVING ADJUSTMENT IN THE EXISTING SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE AND ESTIMATE THE IMPROVED MEASURE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL FROM 2011 TO 2019. WE WILL DO SO USING RESTRICTED AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY AND CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY DATA HOUSED IN THE FEDERAL STATISTICAL RESEARCH DATA CENTERS TO CREATE A COUNTY-SPECIFIC COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND CORRESPONDING COUNTY-SPECIFIC POVERTY THRESHOLDS. IN AIM 3, WE WILL ESTIMATE THE MEDIATING ROLE OF POVERTY REDUCTION IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICAID EXPANSION AND RURAL-URBAN ETHNORACIAL MORTALITY DISPARITIES FROM 2011 TO 2019.

NEWLY AVAILABLE LONGITUDINAL INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DATA ALLOWS US TO RIGOROUSLY EXAMINE THESE EFFECTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A LARGE AND GROWING LITERATURE QUANTIFYING DISPARITIES IN OUTCOMES RELATED TO COVID-19, RELATIVELY LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG MEDICALLY AND SOCIALLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. UNDERSTANDING HOW THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED THE UTILIZATION OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) AND HYPERTENSION (HTN), AS WELL AS THE DOWNSTREAM OUTCOMES, IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING RESULTANT HEALTH DISPARITIES AND MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF FUTURE DISRUPTIONS TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND ADVANCING INTERVENTIONS AND POLICIES TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES WE WILL LEVERAGE THIS NEWLY AVAILABLE AND TIMELY DATA TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN RECEIPT OF HEALTHCARE DURING THE PANDEMIC.

OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO: (1) QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN RECEIPT OF APPROPRIATE PRIMARY CARE, CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, AND DOWNSTREAM HEALTH OUTCOMES; (2) COMPARE THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF PANDEMIC MITIGATION EFFORTS BETWEEN A COMMERCIALLY INSURED POPULATION AND A SAFETY NET POPULATION; AND (3) CONTEXTUALIZE THE SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC USING QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH HEALTH SYSTEMS STAKEHOLDERS. USING ESTABLISHED AND NOVEL DATA SETS, SUPPLEMENTED BY QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WE WILL BE ABLE TO SHED LIGHT ON THE CHANGES IN PATTERNS OF CARE MANAGEMENT BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE PANDEMIC FOR MEDICALLY AND SOCIALLY VULNERABLE PATIENTS.

PROJECT SUMMARY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE CO-OCCURRING PERIOD OF RACIAL TRAUMA HAS UPENDED FAMILY ENVIRONMENTS AND EXACTED A TOLL ON PARENTS (MOTHERS IN PARTICULAR), RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES, AND SEXUAL MINORITIES. UNDERSTANDING HOW PARENTS FUNCTIONED DURING THIS TIME IS CRUCIAL TO IDENTIFYING MECHANISMS LINKING RACE, GENDER, AND SEXUAL IDENTITY MARGINALIZATION TO DISPARITIES IN PARENTAL WELL-BEING WITH CRITICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR CHILD HEALTH. LEVERAGING NOVEL POPULATION-BASED SURVEY AND TIME DIARY DATA COLLECTED THIS PAST YEAR FROM THE NATIONAL COUPLES\u2019 HEALTH AND TIME STUDY (NCHAT), WE WILL IDENTIFY MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GENDER, RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY, AND SEXUAL MINORITY DISPARITIES IN PARENTING STRESS AND PARENTAL WELL-BEING DURING COVID AND THIS PERIOD OF INTENSE RACIAL TRAUMA. NCHAT (N = 3,642) IS A POPULATION-REPRESENTATIVE STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN 20 AND 60 LIVING IN SAME AND DIFFERENT-GENDER COUPLES IN THE U.S. WITH OVERSAMPLES OF BLACK, LATINX, AND ASIAN FAMILIES AND SEXUAL MINORITIES. THE STUDY INCLUDES 41% OF PARTNERS AS WELL. THE ANALYTIC SAMPLE FOR THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE 35% OF THE SAMPLE THAT HAD CHILDREN UNDER 18 (N = 1,274 MAIN RESPONDENTS; N = 567 PARTNERS). THIS PROJECT HAS FOUR SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1. DETERMINE GENDER, RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY, AND SEXUAL MINORITY DISPARITIES IN PARENTING STRESS AND WELL-BEING AND PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP QUALITY AND TEST MARGINALIZATION, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AS MEDIATORS; AIM 2. EVALUATE COVID AND RACIAL TRAUMA STRESS, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND COUPLE RELATIONSHIP FUNCTIONING AS MODERATORS OF PARENTING STRESS AND WELL-BEING AND PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP QUALITY DISPARITIES; AIM 3. IDENTIFY DYADIC STRESS PROCESSES IN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN COVID AND RACIAL TRAUMA STRESS, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND RELATIONSHIP FUNCTIONING AND PARENTING; AIM 4. EXAMINE COMMUNITY DISRUPTIONS AND CONTEXT AS MODERATORS OF PARENTING STRESS AND WELL-BEING AND PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP QUALITY DISPARITIES. FURTHER, THE NCHAT DATA, THE CONTEXTUAL DATA PRODUCED FOR THIS PROJECT ON STRUCTURAL RACISM, SEXISM, AND HETEROSEXISM, AND NCHAT SURVEY ITEMS FOR HARMONIZATION WILL BE SHARED WITH THE SOCIAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH ON COVID-19 CONSORTIUM COORDINATION CENTER (SBECCC) AND THE WIDER HEALTH RESEARCH COMMUNITY, LEVERAGING THE EXCEPTIONAL RESOURCES OF THE INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH AND DATA INNOVATION (ISRDI), HOME TO THE IPUMS DATA PROJECTS. FORTY PERCENT OF NCHAT MAIN RESPONDENTS IDENTIFY RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES, AND 45% IDENTIFY AS SEXUAL MINORITIES. DATA SUCH AS THESE ARE CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS AND INCLUSIVENESS OF THE SBECCC. THIS STUDY ALIGNS WITH THE U01\u2019S INTENTION TO FUND \u201cRESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CORONAVIRUS MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND THE MECHANISMS THAT MAY CONVEY RISK AND RESILIENCE,

AND ENVIRONMENTS. MALADAPTIVE EXPERIENCES EARLY IN LIFE CAN ALTER DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES, LEADING TO HARMFUL AND ENDURING DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUELAE. PRE- AND POSTNATAL HAZARDS INCLUDE MATERNAL SUBSTANCE EXPOSURE, TOXICANT EXPOSURES IN PREGNANCY AND EARLY LIFE, MATERNAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, PARENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, MALTREATMENT, STRUCTURAL RACISM, AND EXCESSIVE STRESS. TO ELUCIDATE HOW VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS IMPACT CHILD DEVELOPMENT, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT A NORMATIVE TEMPLATE OF DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OVER THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF LIFE BE ESTABLISHED BASED ON A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE SAMPLE OF THE US POPULATION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE HEALTHY BRAIN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL CONSORTIUM (HBCD-NC) HAS BEEN FORMED TO DEPLOY A HARMONIZED, OPTIMIZED, AND INNOVATIVE SET OF NEUROIMAGING (MRI, EEG) MEASURES COMPLEMENTED BY AN EXTENSIVE BATTERY OF BEHAVIORAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOLS, AND BIOSPECIMENS TO UNDERSTAND NEURODEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES IN A SAMPLE OF 7,500 MOTHERS AND INFANTS ENROLLED AT 24 SITES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES (US). THE HBCD-NC WILL CARRY OUT A COMMON RESEARCH PROTOCOL UNDER DIRECTION OF THE HBCD- NC ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (HCAC) AND WILL ASSEMBLE AND DISTRIBUTE A COMPREHENSIVE AND WELL-CURATED RESEARCH DATASET TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AT LARGE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE HBCD-NC DATA COORDINATING CENTER (HDCC). THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE HBCD-NC IS TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE, HARMONIZED, AND HIGH- DIMENSIONAL DATASET THAT WILL CHARACTERIZE TYPICAL NEURODEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES IN US CHILDREN AND THAT WILL ASSESS HOW BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AFFECT THOSE TRAJECTORIES.

MALADAPTIVE EXPERIENCES EARLY IN LIFE CAN ALTER DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES, LEADING TO HARMFUL AND ENDURING DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUELAE. PRE- AND POSTNATAL HAZARDS INCLUDE MATERNAL SUBSTANCE EXPOSURE, TOXICANT EXPOSURES IN PREGNANCY AND EARLY LIFE, MATERNAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, PARENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, MALTREATMENT, STRUCTURAL RACISM, AND EXCESSIVE STRESS. TO ELUCIDATE HOW VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS IMPACT CHILD DEVELOPMENT, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT A NORMATIVE TEMPLATE OF DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OVER THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF LIFE BE ESTABLISHED BASED ON A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE SAMPLE OF THE US POPULATION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE HEALTHY BRAIN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL CONSORTIUM (HBCD-NC) HAS BEEN FORMED TO DEPLOY A HARMONIZED, OPTIMIZED, AND INNOVATIVE SET OF NEUROIMAGING (MRI, EEG) MEASURES COMPLEMENTED BY AN EXTENSIVE BATTERY OF BEHAVIORAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOLS, AND BIOSPECIMENS TO UNDERSTAND NEURODEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES IN A SAMPLE OF 7,500 MOTHERS AND INFANTS ENROLLED AT 24 SITES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES (US).

THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE HBCD-NC IS TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE, HARMONIZED, AND HIGH- DIMENSIONAL DATASET THAT WILL CHARACTERIZE TYPICAL NEURODEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES IN US CHILDREN AND THAT WILL ASSESS HOW BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AFFECT THOSE TRAJECTORIES.

ADD HEALTH IS A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF OVER 20,000 ADOLESCENTS WHO WERE IN GRADES 7-12 DURING THE 1994-95 SCHOOL YEAR AND HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED FOR FIVE WAVES TO DATE. OVER 25 YEARS, ADD HEALTH HAS COLLECTED RICH DEMOGRAPHIC, SOCIAL, FAMILIAL, SOCIOECONOMIC, BEHAVIORAL, PSYCHOSOCIAL, COGNITIVE, AND HEALTH SURVEY DATA FROM PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR PARENTS; A VAST ARRAY OF CONTEXTUAL DATA FROM PARTICIPANTS' SCHOOLS, NEIGHBORHOODS, AND GEOGRAPHIES OF RESIDENCE; ADMINISTRATIVE DATA LINKED TO PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING BIRTH AND DEATH CERTIFICATES; AND IN-HOME PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DATA FROM PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES, GENETIC MARKERS, BLOOD-BASED ASSAYS, AND MEDICATIONS. ANCILLARY STUDIES HAVE ADDED MORE INFORMATION, INCLUDING EPIGENETIC, GENE EXPRESSION, AND MICROBIOME DATA. THUS, ADD HEALTH IS EXCEPTIONALLY UNIQUE BECAUSE IT HAS A RICH, MULTI- LEVEL, LONGITUDINAL ARRAY OF DATA FOR A LARGE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE COHORT OF AMERICANS WHO ARE ENTERING MIDLIFE. IMPORTANTLY, THE OVERALL HEALTH PROFILE OF THE COHORT AS THEY MAKE THE TRANSITION TO MIDLIFE IS PROBLEMATIC ACROSS MANY DIMENSIONS. MOREOVER, HEALTH DISPARITIES BY RACE, ETHNICITY, GENDER, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, SEXUAL MINORITY STATUS, AND RURAL-URBAN RESIDENCE IN THIS COHORT ARE WIDE AND, IN SOME CASES, WIDENING. AS SUCH, RICH LONGITUDINAL, MULTI-LEVEL, AND NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO BEST UNDERSTAND THE LIFE COURSE DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH TRAJECTORIES AND HEALTH DISPARITIES OF US ADULTS AS THEY ENTER MIDLIFE. WAVE VI OF ADD HEALTH WILL FILL THIS CRITICAL NEED. THE OVERALL GOAL OF WAVE VI OF ADD HEALTH IS TO COLLECT AND DISSEMINATE THE COMPREHENSIVE DATA NEEDED TO BEST UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, PSYCHOSOCIAL, CONTEXTUAL, AND BIOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH TRAJECTORIES AND DISPARITIES AMONG THIS NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE COHORT OF AMERICANS AS THEY AGE INTO MIDLIFE. THE PROJECT IS FOCUSED AROUND FIVE AIMS: 1) RE-INTERVIEWING COHORT MEMBERS USING PREDOMINANTLY WEB-BASED AND IN-PERSON MODES, WITH EXPLICIT ATTENTION TO SECURING HIGH RESPONSE RATES FROM RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY AND LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS PARTICIPANTS; 2) ENRICHING STUDY CONTENT IN KEY DOMAINS THAT WILL ELUCIDATE MID- AND LATER-LIFE HEALTH TRAJECTORIES AND DISPARITIES; 3) RE-VISITING COHORT MEMBERS WHO CONSENT FOR AN IN-HOME HEALTH EXAM THAT INCLUDES VENOUS BLOOD COLLECTION AND OTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF HEALTH; 4) ASSAYING BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS FOR IMPORTANT PRE-DISEASE AND DISEASE BIOMARKERS; AND 5) CLEANING, DOCUMENTING, DISSEMINATING, ARCHIVING, PROMOTING, AND SUPPORTING WAVE VI DATA FOR THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. THIS PROJECT HAS EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCIENCE OF AGING, HEALTH, AND HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR DECADES TO COME, AS THE ADD HEALTH COHORT AGES INTO THE MIDDLE ADULT YEARS AND BEYOND.

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, CHEROKEE NATION, THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA (OU) SYSTEM, AND THE OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION (OMRF) HAVE PARTNERED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY BUILDING TRIBAL RESEARCH CAPACITY THROUGH THE NATIVE AMERICAN RESEARCH CENTERS FOR HEALTH (NARCH) MECHANISM. IN THIS CYCLE OF NARCH FUNDING, THE PARTNERSHIP AMONG CHEROKEE NATION, OU, AND OMRF CONTINUES AND, IMPORTANTLY FOR STUDENT CAREER ENHANCEMENT, EXPANDS TO INCLUDE THE OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU) SYSTEM AS A KEY PARTNER FOR STUDENT CAREER ENHANCEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE OVERALL MISSION OF CHEROKEE NARCH IS TO DEVELOP DURABLE RESEARCH CAPACITY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AN AMERICAN INDIAN (AI) TRIBAL NATION TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE FIVE SPECIFIC AIMS OF CHEROKEE NARCH ARE: 1. TO STRENGTHEN ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING A LEADERSHIP TEAM (LT) AND A TRIBAL-CAMPUS  ADVISORY COMMITTEE (TCAC), THAT ENSURES INTEGRATION OF CAREER ENHANCEMENT, CAPACITY BUILDING, AND  RESEARCH ACTIVITIES; 2. TO EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF RESEARCHERS TO ENGAGE MEANINGFULLY WITH CHEROKEE NATION IN THE  CONTEXT OF TRIBAL RESEARCH, FOCUSING ON UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE AND HEALTH PROFESSIONS STUDENTS; 3. TO BUILD TRIBAL CAPACITY BY DEVELOPING A SET OF RESEARCH CODES TO GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF GENOMIC AND OTHER  BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PREDICATED ON THE CONCEPT OF TRIBAL DATA SOVEREIGNTY; 4. TO CONDUCT INNOVATIVE RESEARCH AND PILOT RESEARCH CAPABLE OF SEEDING FUTURE RESEARCH PROJECTS  PERFORMED BY RESEARCHERS SEEKING TO WORK WITHIN THE CHEROKEE NATION SETTING; AND 5. TO EVALUATE ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP, INCLUDING MONITORING PROGRESS OF STUDENT CAREER ENHANCEMENT,  CAPACITY BUILDING, AND RESEARCH/PILOT RESEARCH PROJECTS, AND EVALUATION OF THE OVERALL CHEROKEE NARCH PROGRAM.

ONE FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DISPARITY IS GENETIC VARIATION IN APOLIPOPROTEIN L1 (APOL1). APOL1 IS A PLASMA PROTEIN OF UNKNOWN CELLULAR FUNCTION THAT IS PROTECTIVE AGAINST HUMAN SLEEPING SICKNESS CAUSED BY MOST AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMES BUT NOT TRYPANOSOMA BRUCEI RHODESIENSE OR T.B GAMBIENSE. IN HUMANS, THERE ARE THREE MAIN ALLELIC VARIANTS OF APOL1: G0 (WILD-TYPE), G1, AND G2. THE G1 AND G2 APOL1 ALLELES (I.E. RENAL RISK ALLELES) IMPART RESISTANCE TO SLEEPING SICKNESS, WHILE THE G0 ALLELE ENABLES PARASITE SURVIVAL AND INFECTION. FOR THIS REASON, THE G1 AND G2 ALLELES ARE PREVALENT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH AFRICAN ANCESTRY. WHILE BENEFICIAL FOR RESISTING SLEEPING SICKNESS, THE G1 AND G2 VARIANTS ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATLY INCREASED RISK FOR ESRD AND REDUCED ALLOGRAFT LONGEVITY IN KIDNEYS TRANSPLANTED FROM DONORS WITH TWO RISK ALLELES. EXPRESSION OF JUST ONE COPY OF THE G0 VARIANT IN KIDNEY DONORS IMPROVES ALLOGRAFT LONGEVITY, REDUCES RE-TRANSPLANTATIONS AND ELIMINATES THE INCREASED RISK FOR ESRD ASSOCIATED WITH THE G1/G2 RISK VARIANTS, REGARDLESS OF RECIPIENT APOL1 STATUS. IT FOLLOWS THAT ACCURATE RISK ASSESSMENT BASED ON APOL1 VARIANT EXPRESSION IN KIDNEY DONORS IS CRITICAL FOR KIDNEY DONOR SAFETY, DONOR INFORMED CONSENT, AND THE PROPER ALLOCATION OF KIDNEYS TO RECIPIENTS BASED ON PROJECTED POST- TRANSPLANT SURVIVAL. ADDITIONALLY, SUBSTITUTING APOL1 STATUS INSTEAD OF AFRICAN AMERICAN RACE AS A RISK FACTOR ON THE KIDNEY DONOR RISK INDEX IS PREDICTED TO REMOVE UNNECESSARY PENALTIES APPLIED TO DONORS OF AFRICAN ANCESTRY WITHOUT TWO RISK ALLELES, THUS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF KIDNEYS APPROVED FOR TRANSPLANT. HOWEVER, CURRENT TESTS FOR APOL1 STATUS ARE NOT FDA-CLEARED AND REQUIRE GENE SEQUENCING OR MASS-SPECTROMETRY WHICH ARE TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING AND INFEASIBLE DURING THE 1-HOUR TIMEFRAME AVAILABLE FOR THE PRE-TRANSPLANT RISK EVALUATION OF DECEASED DONORS (>70% OF ALL KIDNEY DONORS). STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES IN THE APOL1 VARIANTS, IN COMBINATION WITH DIFFERENTIAL BINDING TO A TRYPANOSOME PROTEIN, MAKE THIS SYSTEM A SUITABLE TARGET FOR ASSAY DEVELOPMENT.

IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 77% (OR 15.5 MILLION) HISPANIC WOMEN ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. OBESITY IS DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, BUT IS MAINLY DUE TO POOR DIET AND PHYSICAL INACTIVITY. GIVEN THIS, MOST SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTIONS THAT REDUCE ADIPOSITY INDICES (E.G. BMI, WEIGHT, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE) INCORPORATE BOTH DIET AND EXERCISE. SUCCESSFUL OBESITY INTERVENTIONS FOR HISPANICS UTILIZE CULTURAL TAILORING AND HAVE RELIED ON PROMOTORES DE SALUD (ALSO KNOWN AS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS) AS KEY FACILITATORS IN DELIVERING THESE INTERVENTIONS. PROMOTORES ARE EFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING OBESITY INTERVENTIONS AND PROMOTING BEHAVIOR CHANGE THROUGH ENHANCED MOTIVATION, SOCIAL SUPPORT, SOCIAL INTERACTION AND CONNECTEDNESS, AND SELF-EFFICACY.  HOWEVER, ADEQUATE IN-PERSON PROMOTORA TRAINING IS NECESSARY FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INTERVENTIONS.

THEIR LONG-TERM TRAJECTORY IS POOR, THE COSTS TO SOCIETY ARE HIGH, AND LASTING EFFECTS ON COMMUNITY WELL-BEING AND INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS ARE PROFOUND. ALTERING THIS TRAJECTORY IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY. PREVENTING HIV AMONG TEENS (PHAT) LIFE IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE NEED IN JUVENILE JUSTICE TO ADDRESS YOUTHS' CO-MORBID HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE NEXT\u2013\u2013AND PERHAPS MOST CRITICAL\u2013\u2013 STEP IN ENSURING THAT THIS DECADE-LONG LINE OF RESEARCH PRODUCES ACTUAL, REAL-WORLD IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LIVES OF PROBATION YOUTH IS TO DEVELOP A PHAT LIFE TRAINING STRATEGY THAT IS EFFECTIVE, COST-EFFECTIVE, AND SUSTAINABLE WITHIN JUVENILE JUSTICE SETTINGS.

MORE THAN HALF OF LATINOS WILL DEVELOP DIABETES IN THEIR LIFETIME AND ARE 50% MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM IT COMPARED TO NON-HISPANIC WHITES. CONSUMPTION OF A HIGH FAT DIET, INSUFFICIENT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND BEING OVERWEIGHT/OBESE HAVE ALL BEEN LINKED TO T2D. CONSISTENT WITH THIS, HISPANICS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN THESE RISK BEHAVIORS AND BE OVERWEIGHT/OBESE. FORTUNATELY, A RELATIVELY MODEST REDUCTION IN BODY WEIGHT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING T2D. THE LANDMARK DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP) HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THIS. PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED THE DPP REDUCED THEIR WEIGHT BY 5-7%. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL ADAPTATIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN RACIAL/ETHNIC POPULATIONS.  HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS A GAP. RURAL HISPANIC ADULTS EXPERIENCE EVEN WORSE DIABETES-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS COMPARED TO THEIR COUNTERPARTS LIVING IN METROPOLITAN COUNTIES. FURTHERMORE, RURAL HISPANIC FACE FORMIDABLE ACCESS AND RESOURCE BARRIERS. EMPLOYING AN IN-PERSON DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THIS AT-RISK POPULATION. HOWEVER, LATINOS HAVE HIGH RATES OF OWNERSHIP OF SMARTPHONES AND RURAL HISPANICS UTILIZE THE INTERNET FROM A MOBILE DEVICE AT HIGHER RATES THAN BOTH CAUCASIANS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS. THUS, UTILIZING A MOBILE, WEB-BASED APPROACH IS A LAUDABLE MEANS OF TARGETING A HIGH-RISK COMMUNITY.  THIS WILL BE THE FIRST MHEALTH DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM THAT WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY TAILOR THE DPP FOR TWO PRIORITY POPULATIONS: HISPANICS AND THOSE LIVING IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THIS EVIDENCE-BASED AND THEORY DRIVEN INTERVENTION WILL PROVIDE RURAL HISPANICS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND SELF-EFFICACY TO IMPROVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND REDUCE DIABETES RISK. USERS WILL EXPLORE CONTENT ON HEALTHY EATING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THROUGH AN ARRAY OF VIDEOS, EASY TO UNDERSTAND DIAGRAMS, AND SIMPLE NAVIGATION FEATURES.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY 1.2 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV IN THE UNITED STATES, AND AMONG MSM NATIONALLY, BLACK MSM HAD THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES IN 2018. ENGAGEMENT IN CARE IS OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS A CONTINUUM INCLUDING 1) HIV DIAGNOSIS, 2) LINKAGE TO CARE, 3) RETENTION IN CARE, 4) HIV ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) INITIATION, AND 5) VIRAL SUPPRESSION, AND YBMSM EXPERIENCE SEVERE DISPARITIES ACROSS THE HIV CARE CONTINUUM, COMPARED TO BOTH OLDER BLACK MSM AND YOUNG WHITE AND LATINO MSM. OUR VSS ADDRESSES MULTI-FACETED CHALLENGES THAT LEAD TO POOR TREATMENT INITIATION, ADHERENCE, AND RETENTION OUTCOMES AMONG YBMSM. IT TAKES A HOLISTIC APPROACH, TAILORED SPECIFICALLY FOR YBMSM, TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING AND REDUCE STIGMA THROUGH CUSTOMIZABLE VIDEO-BASED SUPPORT, A COMMUNITY OF PEERS, ON-DEMAND INFORMATION, AND ACCESS TO LOCAL RESOURCES WITHIN A SIMPLE-TO-FOLLOW USER INTERFACE. MOREOVER, VSS FILLS A CRITICAL GAP, AS MHEALTH PROGRAMS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO YBMSM LIVING WITH HIV ARE FEW IN NUMBER AND TYPICALLY NARROW IN SCOPE. VSS WILL BE FREE OF COST FOR YBMSM AND MARKETED TO HIV ORGANIZATIONS NATIONWIDE. OUR PHASE I FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT VSS IS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE, USABLE, AND APPEALING TO BOTH YBMSM LIVING WITH HIV AND THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT VSS, CREATED USING HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN, WILL IMPROVE HIV CARE CONTINUUM OUTCOMES (AS MEASURED BY VIRAL SUPPRESSION) AND REDUCE STIGMA AMONG YBMSM AGES 18-29 WHO ARE LIVING WITH HIV. THIS NEW INTERVENTION WILL ALSO ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF HIV SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS NATIONWIDE TO ENSURE OPTIMAL HIV CARE FOR YBMSM CLIENTS, AS VSS CAN BE EASILY INTEGRATED INTO THEIR EXISTING LINKAGE AND CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. SEVERAL HIV SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EXPRESSED A NEED FOR VSS AND WILL SUPPORT THE PROJECT AS COLLABORATORS. THERE ARE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS TO OUR PROPOSAL. AIM 1: COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VSS AND PROVIDER DASHBOARD IN COLLABORATION WITH YBMSM LIVING WITH HIV AND PROVIDERS. AIM 2: CONDUCT AN RCT WITH YBMSM LIVING WITH HIV (N=264 AT 5 SITES) TO ASSESS IMPACT ON HIV CARE CONTINUUM AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES. AIM 3: CONDUCT A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF VSS AMONG HIV PROVIDERS AND YBMSM LIVING WITH HIV. IN YEAR 1, WE WILL COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VSS PRODUCT AND CONDUCT USABILITY TESTING AND CONSULTATION OF ADVISORY BOARDS OF SERVICE PROVIDERS AND YBMSM LIVING WITH HIV. YEAR 2 WILL INVOLVE A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL AND A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF VSS.

WHILE 40 STATES CURRENTLY MANDATE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) TO PROMOTE STUDENT PUBLIC HEALTH OBJECTIVES AND FMS DEVELOPMENT, MOST MARGINALIZED STUDENTS DO NOT EXPERIENCE ADEQUATE PE PARTICIPATION BECAUSE TEACHERS (BOTH PE CERTIFIED AND REGULAR CLASSROOM TEACHERS WHO TEACH PE) HAVE LIMITED OR NO ACCESS TO EASY TO USE AND LOW COST PROGRAMMATIC RESOURCES FOR CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE, EVIDENCE-BASED, AND STANDARDS-BASED PE.

THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A KEY LOCUS FOR ADDRESSING THIS MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH  NEED, AS PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF CARE 6 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY. ALTHOUGH  CURRENTLY NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE, DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED AS A SOLUTION FOR EXPANDING ACCESS  TO SUCH PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN PRIMARY CARE. THIS LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR WOMEN WITH PRIOR  APOS IS A PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY GAP AMONG PRIMARY CARE CLINICS SERVING LARGE LATINA POPULATIONS, GIVEN THE  MANY HISTORICAL DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY LATINAS IN HEALTH, COVERAGE, AND ACCESS TO CARE.

WE CALL  OUR PROPOSED APP MIASANO (DERIVED FROM THE PHRASE \u201cMY HEALTH\u201d IN THE ESPERANTO UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE). THE  PRIMARY PROBLEM THAT OUR APP ADDRESSES IS THAT PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES (PROMS) ARE COLLECTED  LESS OFTEN IN RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES. PROVIDERS MAY NOT ASK PATIENTS TO COMPLETE PROMS DUE TO LANGUAGE  BARRIERS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PATIENT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND A PROM IN ENGLISH AND THE PROVIDER MAY  NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH THE PATIENT ABOUT THE RESULTS. BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE BARRIER,  PATIENTS MAY BE HESITANT OR SIMPLY UNABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR HEALTH CONCERNS OR STATUS. MANY MEDICAL CLINICS CAN  OFFER INTERPRETERS TO ASSIST WITH LANGUAGE BARRIERS, BUT THIS CREATES A RELIANCE ON INTERPRETER AVAILABILITY. WHEN AN  INTERPRETER IS PRESENT, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE BUSY INTERPRETER CREATES UNINTENTIONAL BIAS WHEN INTERPRETING  PROM QUESTIONS OR RELAYING PROVIDER MESSAGES TO THE PATIENT. THESE PATIENT POPULATIONS EXPERIENCE POORER  HEALTH OUTCOMES. THIS LEADS TO HEALTH DISPARITIES BECAUSE THEIR HEALTH NEEDS ARE NOT BEING PROPERLY EVALUATED  OR UNDERSTOOD AND EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL CARE CANNOT TAKE PLACE. FURTHER, MIASANO PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY  TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE IN RESEARCH STUDIES BY INCLUDING PROMS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. INDIVIDUALS WITH DIFFERENT  RACIAL/ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS WOULD BE MORE EASILY INCLUDED TO PARTICIPATE IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT USES PROMS.  THEREFORE, THE DISPARITY IN RESEARCH INCLUSION WOULD BE REDUCED AND COULD BE ULTIMATELY ELIMINATED THROUGH  BETTER REPRESENTATION IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND INCREASED APPLICABILITY OF THE RESEARCH RESULTS. OUR MIASANO APP  SOLUTION TO THESE PROBLEMS COMBINES SEVERAL UNIQUE FEATURES: USER APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE SWITCHING WHICH  ALLOWS DIRECT AND INSTANTANEOUS COMMUNICATION OF HEALTH OUTCOMES AND STATUS BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT  LANGUAGES, PROVIDING HEALTH ASSESSMENT IN THE PATIENT\u2019S PREFERRED LANGUAGE AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS IN THE  HEALTH CARE PROVIDER\u2019S PREFERRED LANGUAGE, ALL IN THE SAME APP; TEXT-TO-SPEECH ACCESSIBILITY AND USE OF VISUAL  CONTROLS ON THE MOBILE DEVICE WHICH ENHANCES ACCESSIBILITY TO THE PERSONS WHO MIGHT HAVE SOME LEVEL OF  ILLITERACY AND WHO PREFER TO COMMUNICATE ORALLY. THE PROMS QUERIES CAN BE DICTATED BY THE MOBILE DEVICE AND  THE USER CAN RESPOND BY TAPPING ON THE SCREEN. THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER RECEIVES THE SAME COMPLETE  ASSESSMENT AS IF THE PATIENT HAD BEEN ABLE TO READ; AND DEFINING MEDICAL TERMS WITH POP-UP WINDOWS THAT  DISPLAY COMMON LANGUAGE DESCRIPTIONS IS IMPORTANT AS MEDICAL TERMS MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR EVEN TO THOSE WHO  ARE QUITE LITERATE.

AMERICA HAS THE LARGEST PER CAPITA HEALTH EXPENDITURE IN THE WORLD, AND AMERICANS BEAR THE SIGNIFICANT BURDEN OF THIS WITH MEDICAL DEBT REACHING US $81 BILLION IN 2016 [1][2]. OVER A QUARTER OF AMERICANS HAVE CHALLENGES PAYING FOR MEDICAL CARE AND THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS THOSE MINORITY HEALTH AND DISPARITY POPULATIONS, LEADING TO DISPARITIES IN ACCESS AND ULTIMATELY HEALTH OUTCOMES. FOR EXAMPLE, BLACKS/AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE 25% MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CHALLENGES PAYING FOR MEDICAL CARE THAN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN, HISPANICS/LATINOS - 30% HIGHER AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS - 60% HIGHER FOR THOSE WHO EARN LESS THAN $50,000 [3].

THE ABILITY TO SAVE PRICING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PROVIDERS AND SERVICES A PATIENT MAY NEED, AND THE OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS THEY MAY INCUR WILL AVOID SURPRISE BILLS AND ALLOW FOR RECONCILIATION WHEN BILLS ARE RECEIVED. THIS CAN HELP AVOID EXCESSIVE CHARGES AND EMPOWERS PATIENTS TO INQUIRE ABOUT DISCREPANCIES.

THIS HEALTH DISPARITY IS CRITICAL, AS ELEVATED BP IS THE PRIMARY MODIFIABLE RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.  ONE REASON FOR THIS HTN DISPARITY: STRESS. AFRICAN AMERICANS EXPERIENCE MORE STRESS THAN THEIR WHITE PEERS, MOST NOTABLY FROM RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, AND HAVE FEWER RESOURCES TO MANAGE THESE STRESSORS. THIS STRESS HAS SIGNIFICANT PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. COMPARED TO WHITES, AFRICAN AMERICANS SHOW HEIGHTENED ALLOSTATIC LOAD, A MEASURE OF THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF CHRONICALLY ACTIVATING THE STRESS PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. IMPORTANTLY, STRESS-INDUCED ACTIVATION OF THESE SYSTEMS IS IMPLICATED IN THE ETIOLOGY OF HTN. STRESS ALSO EXACERBATES HTN THROUGH UNHEALTHY COPING (E.G., SMOKING, OVEREATING, ALCOHOL USE) AND POORER ADHERENCE TO ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICATIONS. STRESS PREDICTS THESE COPING BEHAVIORS AND MEDICAL NONCOMPLIANCE IN AFRICAN AMERICANS. DESPITE CLEAR LINKS BETWEEN STRESS AND HTN, STRESS MANAGEMENT IS NOT REGULARLY DEPLOYED TO MANAGE BP. THIS IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE STRESS MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE HTN.  EXISTING RESEARCH ON STRESS MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS FOR BP REDUCTION INCLUDED MOSTLY WHITE PARTICIPANTS. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR MINORITY GROUPS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN GENERIC PROGRAMS. BECAUSE STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVES HEALTH DISPARITIES IN HTN, DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE STRESS MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN IS VITAL TO CLOSING THIS GAP.

DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A LIFESTYLE CHANGE PROTOCOL THAT IS PROVEN TO REDUCE THE RISK OF TYPE 2 DIABETES BY HALF FOR PRE-DIABETICS PATIENTS AT RISK BY ENCOURAGING WEIGHT-LOSS. BUT, DESPITE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM, MORE THAN 50% OF PARTICIPANTS DROP OUT BEFORE COMPLETING THIS YEAR-LONG LIFESTYLE CHANGE PROGRAM, SEVERELY LIMITING THE PROGRAM\u2019S SUCCESS. THIS IS IN PART DUE TO THE FACT THAT PROGRAMS LIKE DPP TAKE LITTLE ACCOUNT OF THE LIMITATIONS FACED BY UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT IT IS MEANT TO HELP. THIS LACK OF SUPPORT AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY LEVEL COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR, NOR ECONOMICAL, IN SUPPORTING PATIENT HEALTH OUTSIDE THE MEDICAL FACILITY WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED. THIS CREATES A GAP IN HEALTHCARE SERVICE THAT CURRENT SYSTEMS CANNOT OVERCOME. VIORA IS CLOSING THIS HEALTH SERVICES GAP WITH A SYSTEM THAT INTERFACES BETWEEN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, THE UNDERSERVED PATIENT, AND UNDERUTILIZED COMMUNITY-BASED RESOURCES AND PROVIDERS, TO FACILITATE BETTER OUTCOMES IN PROGRAMS LIKE DPP. BY USING RISK STRATIFICATION BASED ON SDOH FACTORS, EACH DPP PARTICIPANT CAN HAVE TAILORED INTERVENTIONS THAT CONSIDER THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC AND SOCIOCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS. THE VIORA HEALTH SYSTEM CONNECTS PATIENTS TO LOCAL RESOURCES USING SIMPLE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PATIENT, HEALTH PROVIDERS, AND COMMUNITY SERVICES, FACILITATING PATIENT COMPLETION OF THE DPP PROGRAM, THEREBY IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES. IN PHASE I, VIORA WILL EVALUATE A LARGER SET OF PRE-DIABETES AND SDOH RISK FACTORS ACROSS 5000 MINORITY AND UNDERSERVED SUBJECTS TO SELECT THE MOST RELEVANT VARIABLES FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND PERSONAL PREVENTION PLAN DEVELOPMENT. THE SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY SCREEN PRE-DIABETIC PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE, READY AND ABLE TO ADHERE TO DPP, AND WILL CREATE A PERSONALIZED INTERVENTION PLAN THAT IS THE MOST IMPACTFUL IN REDUCING THEIR RISK BUT IS ALSO DOABLE. THE SYSTEM\u2019S COMMUNICATION NETWORK WILL BE EXPANDED TO PROVIDE DIRECT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PATIENT, DPP COACH, HEALTH PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES, TO SUPPORT THE PARTICIPANT TOWARD MAINTAINING THEIR DPP GOALS. FINALLY, THE PROJECT WILL ASSESS THE BASIC FUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM, PREFERENCES AND HUMAN INTERACTION IN A HUMAN SUBJECT STUDY WITH UNDERSERVED SUBJECTS AND COMMUNITY-BASED PARTNERS. COMPLETION OF PHASE I WILL DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF OUR SOFTWARE SYSTEM INCORPORATING MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE VIORA SYSTEM, WHICH WILL INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT TO BE TESTED IN PHASE 2.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ece8651f-eb10-0df8-d498-64eee5fbcfe1-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43MD015981_7529"}, {"internal_id": 133585502, "Award ID": "R43MD015969", "Award Amount": 361550.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-10", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "DIGITAL HEALTH FOR MEDICATION ADHERENCE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS WITH HYPERTENSION - ABSTRACT: UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PATRICIA WEITZMAN, PHD, A MULTICULTURAL, MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF CLINICIANS AND RESEARCHERS WILL COLLABORATE TO DEVELOP, FORMATIVELY TEST, AND EVALUATE THE SHORT-EFFECTIVENESS OF A DIGITAL PROVIDER PLATFORM, CALLED MEMENTO.HTN, THAT IS INTEGRATED WITH A PATIENT SMS TEXT SYSTEM, AND DESIGNED TO SUPPORT MEDICATION ADHERENCE BY AFRICAN AMERICANS WITH HYPERTENSION (HTN). HTN IS MORE COMMON AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS THAN FOR ANY OTHER ETHNIC GROUP. MORE THAN HALF OF AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS, ABOUT 15 MILLION PEOPLE, HAVE HTN. FURTHERMORE, AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE 4 TIMES LESS LIKELY TO ADHERE TO HTN MEDICATIONS COMPARED TO THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. TAILORED APPROACHES TO REDUCE THE RACIAL GAP IN HTN MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT SUPPORT MEDICATION ADHERENCE, ARE NEEDED IN PRIMARY CARE. SUCH APPROACHES MUST OVERCOME BARRIERS DUE TO COST OR GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE THAT CAN PREVENT AFRICAN AMERICAN PATIENTS FROM ACCESSING ADHERENCE SUPPORT. THESE APPROACHES MUST ALSO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO THE DELIVERY OF ADHERENCE SUPPORT THAT STEM FROM HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. IMPORTANTLY, HTN IS ONE OF MOST COMMON CO-MORBIDITIES IN COVID19 HOSPITALIZATIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS (CDC 2020). MOREOVER, MEDIA COVERAGE OF A POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN CERTAIN HTN MEDS, CALLED RAAS INHIBITORS, AND SEVERE COVID19 OUTCOMES MAY HAVE ALARMED HTN PATIENTS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR MEDS. AS A RESULT, THE ACC (MARCH, 2020) PROMPTLY ISSUED GUIDELINES RECOMMENDING ALL PATIENTS ADHERE TO HTN MEDS DURING THE PANDEMIC UNLESS ADVISED BY THEIR PHYSICIANS, AS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A LINK BETWEEN HTN DRUGS AND COVID19 SEVERITY. THUS, IN THE TIME OF COVID19, SUPPORTING MEDICATION ADHERENCE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WITH HTN IS EXTREMELY URGENT. MEMENTO.HTN IS INNOVATIVE IN THREE KEY WAYS: 1) TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, IT IS THE FIRST-EVER LINKED DIGITAL PROVIDER PLATFORM AND PATIENT SMS TEXT SYSTEM FOR HTN MEDICATION ADHERENCE. 2) IT IS CULTURALLY-TAILORED FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS WITH HTN. 3) IT HAS UNIQUE MONITORING FUNCTIONALITY ALLOWING PROVIDERS TO MONITOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENT ADHERENCE; SUPPORT `NEW START' PATIENTS, WHO ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR NON-ADHERENCE; AND TRACK GROUP ADHERENCE RATES BY DRUG CLASS, PILL FORMAT, AND PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN INCLUDED IN ANY DIGITAL MED ADHERENCE INTERVENTION. THUS, THE MEMENTO.HTN SYSTEM GREATLY SIMPLIFIES AND FACILITATES PROVIDER DELIVERY OF ADHERENCE SUPPORT TO PATIENTS, WHILE ENHANCING THEIR CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS. THE PROVIDER PLATFORM SENDS PATIENTS INTERACTIVE SMS-TEXT PILL REMINDERS PLUS CULTURALLY-SENSITIVE MOTIVATIONAL, EDUCATIONAL, SPIRITUAL/STRESS-SUPPORTIVE, AND CUSTOMIZABLE TEXTS, ALONG WITH TEXTS TARGETING INTENTIONAL NON-ADHERENCE AND COVID19-RELATED CONCERNS. TEXTS GO DIRECTLY TO PATIENT CELLPHONES (NO MOBILE APP NEEDED), MAKING THE INTERVENTION ACCESSIBLE TO PATIENTS WHO DO NOT POSSESS SMARTPHONES. IMPORTANTLY, MEMENTO ALLOWS 2-WAY TEXTING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS, AND AUTOMATICALLY ALERTS PROVIDERS WHEN A PATIENT HAS A CLINICALLY-SIGNIFICANT PILL LAPSE. WE BELIEVE MEMENTO HAS SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL, AS EHG HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED PLANS FOR MULTIPLE DIGITAL ADHERENCE INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL BE MARKETED TOGETHER TO CLINICS SERVING LARGE NUMBERS OF AT-RISK PATIENTS.

LABOR. SUCH MONITORING IS PERFORMED WITH AN ELECTRONIC FETAL MONITOR (EFM) TO DECREASE THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLICATIONS WHILE MINIMIZING THE NEED FOR UNNECESSARY OBSTETRIC INTERVENTIONS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN WITH HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES. INADEQUATE MONITORING INCREASES THE RISK OF MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, AND POOR INFANT OUTCOMES. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY WOMEN, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES, FACE MANY BARRIERS LIKE SUFFICIENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO ADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE LIKE EFM. FURTHERMORE, EFMS USED IN HOSPITALS ARE NOT PORTABLE AND CAN BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FOR MID- TO LOW-RESOURCE COMMUNITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, MONITORS FOR HOME USE MEASURE ONLY 1 PARAMETER AND THEREFORE NOT APPROVED FOR CLINICAL DECISION MAKING. FETAL LIFE\u2019S SOLUTION IS A NOVEL EFM SYSTEM BASED ON A PATENT-PENDING ENGINEERING DESIGN.

WHILE BEHAVIOR CHANGE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO ASSIST PARTICIPANTS IN SUSTAINING BEHAVIOR CHANGE, VERY FEW PROGRAMS HAVE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN. THE USE OF MHEALTH, AS OPPOSED TO OTHER AVENUES OF INTERVENTION DELIVERY, IS BASED ON PUBLISHED REPORTS DOCUMENTING THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS PERCEIVE MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AS AN ACCEPTABLE MEANS OF INTERVENTION DELIVERY. IN ADDITION, OWNERSHIP OF SMARTPHONES AND THE USE OF TEXT MESSAGING ARE HIGHEST AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS COMPARED TO OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS. THEREFORE, A MHEALTH INTERVENTION TARGETING AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN SEEMS FEASIBLE AND POTENTIALLY EFFECTIVE.

TWO WEEKS LATER, SMOKERS WHO DO NOT RESPOND TO THE FIRST TYPE OF MESSAGES WILL BE RE-RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE ONE OF THE TOP TWO PERFORMING MESSAGE TYPES ARISING FROM THE FIRST CYCLE OF MESSAGING. NON-RESPONDERS TO THE SECOND CYCLE WILL BE RE-RANDOMIZED AGAIN TO RECEIVE ANOTHER CYCLE OF THE TOP TWO PERFORMING MESSAGES. AFTER ALL THREE CYCLES ARE COMPLETE, WE EXPECT THAT AT LEAST 629 LATINO SMOKERS WILL ENROLL IN LKB. WE WILL CAREFULLY TRACK ENGAGEMENT, RETENTION, AND SATISFACTION WITH LKB. AIM 1.

IN THE PAST DECADE, ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) ADOPTION AND USE HAS INCREASED BUT UNEQUALLY. PROVIDERS CARING FOR DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE AND USE ADVANCED EHRS WITH SOPHISTICATED CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT, ANALYTICS, AND OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES. WHILE EHRS ARE FAILING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF UNITED STATES\u2019 PROVIDERS MORE GENERALLY, EHR-RELATED CHALLENGES ARE PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOR PROVIDERS WHO TREAT DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS DUE TO TIME PRESSURES, LIMITED RESOURCES, AND THE NEED TO ADDRESS MANY SOCIAL ISSUES. FURTHERMORE, EHRS HAVE RESULTED IN THE ACCUMULATION OF VAST AMOUNTS OF DATA, BUT PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE TIME TO SIFT THROUGH IT ALL IN A PATIENT ENCOUNTER \u2013 BETTER TOOLS ARE NEEDED TO SUMMARIZE, ORGANIZE, AND DISPLAY THE DATA IN A WAY THAT BETTER SUPPORTS CARE. FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES, PROVIDERS NEED TO INSTANTLY SEE, ASSESS, AND TAKE ACTION ON THEIR PATIENTS\u2019 STATUS IN A GLANCE, WITHOUT SEARCHING THROUGH LABORATORY RESULTS, WEIGHTS, DIET, HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, NOTES, AND COMORBIDITIES SCATTERED THROUGHOUT A SYSTEM. ASP.MD AND THE RAND CORPORATION HAVE DEVELOPED PRELIMINARY DESIGNS FOR A MORE USABLE EHR USER INTERFACE (UI) THAT ORGANIZES AND CONSOLIDATES CLINICAL DATA INTO \u201cVIEWERS\u201d BASED ON CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL PROBLEMS. VIEWERS ARE FAR MORE ADVANCED THAN TRADITIONAL PROBLEM LISTS. THEY VISUALIZE CONTEXT- RELEVANT LONGITUDINAL DATA, SET VISIT AGENDAS, TRACK TASKS, AND EXECUTE OTHER CLINICALLY USEFUL ACTIVITIES. THESE VISUAL INNOVATIONS HELP PROVIDERS QUICKLY ASSESS A PATIENT\u2019S OVERALL STATUS AND SPECIFIC CLINICAL NEEDS BASED ON THEIR DATA AND SYMPTOMS. IN THIS WORK, WE WILL ENGAGE PROVIDERS WHO CARE FOR MEDICAID AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND TEST THIS NOVEL EHR UI. IN AIM 1, WE WILL USE USER-CENTERED DESIGN METHODS TO DEVELOP DETAILED PROTOTYPES AND CLINICAL SCENARIOS FOR TESTING. THE SCENARIOS WILL BE COMMON FOR PROVIDERS WHO TREAT DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS AND THEY WILL PROMOTE IMPROVEMENT ON ESTABLISHED QUALITY MEASURES. WE WILL INTEGRATE THESE PROTOTYPES INTO AN EXISTING EHR, DEVELOPED BY ASP.MD. IN AIM 2, WE WILL TEST THE USABILITY OF THE PROTOTYPES THROUGH STRUCTURED SESSIONS. ASP.MD IS AN IDEAL SETTING FOR DEVELOPING AND TESTING THIS INNOVATION BY BUILDING OFF ITS EXISTING, FEDERALLY CERTIFIED COMMERCIAL EHR AND PRACTICE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. ASP.MD\u2019S EHR IS WEB-BASED, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO IMMEDIATELY DISTRIBUTE NEW FEATURES TO ALL USERS. WE WILL BUILD USING THE STANDARDS-BASED FAST HEALTH INTEROPERABILITY RESOURCE (FHIR) APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (API), MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO USE OUR VIEWERS WITH OTHER EHRS AS WELL. THIS WORK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE DISPARITIES BY GIVING PROVIDERS WHO CARE FOR DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS AN AFFORDABLE, ADVANCED EHR. PROVIDERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO RELEVANT, ORGANIZED, SYNTHESIZED CLINICAL DATA AT THE POINT OF CARE, FACILITATING THEIR ABILITY TO CLOSE QUALITY OF CARE GAPS AND REDUCING BURNOUT.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ENGAGE BLACK, LATINX, AND APPALACHIAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THEIR TEACHERS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR) PROGRAM FOCUSED ON SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. CBPR IS AN ORIENTATION TO SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY THAT VALUES SHARED DECISION-MAKING AND EQUITABLE COLLABORATION BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND ACADEMIC PARTNERS. IN THIS CASE, CBPR WILL ENGAGE STUDENTS IN THE ROLE OF SCIENTIST, WITH RESPECTED CONTEXTUAL EXPERTISE AND PERSPECTIVE THAT WILL NOT ONLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE RESEARCH BUT ALSO INCREASES THE POTENTIAL FOR POSITIVE SOCIAL CHANGE. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT ENGAGING STUDENTS IN CBPR TO INVESTIGATE SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES WILL ALLOW YOUTH TO EXPERIENCE HOW SCIENTIFIC PRACTICES AND STEM SKILLS CAN ADDRESS REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS RELEVANT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. BY FACILITATING MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SCIENCE RESEARCH, WE WILL REACH OUR LONG-TERM GOAL OF INCREASING STEM WORKFORCE DIVERSITY. OUR PROGRAM HAS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) PROMOTE STUDENTS\u2019 INTEREST IN AND UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BY ENGAGING STUDENTS AS CO- RESEARCHERS IN ORIGINAL SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES; (2) DEVELOP STUDENTS\u2019 SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SKILLS, SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION SKILLS, RESEARCHER IDENTITIES, AND SCIENCE SELF-EFFICACY BY ENGAGING STUDENTS AT EACH STEP OF THE RESEARCH PROCESS INCLUDING PRESENTATION AND PUBLICATION OF FINDINGS; AND (3) DEVELOP HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS\u2019 CAPACITIES TO SUPPORT YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION THROUGH INTERACTIVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. EXPECTED OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS INCLUDE INCREASES IN STEM KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS, INTEREST IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, AND STEM EFFICACY; AND A DESIRE TO PURSUE A BIOMEDICAL, BEHAVIORAL OR CLINICAL RESEARCH CAREER. WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS THROUGH A CYCLE OF ACTIVITIES THAT EACH YEAR ENGAGES A NEW GROUP OF STUDENTS AS CO-RESEARCHERS IN INVESTIGATIONS OF SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THROUGHOUT THE ACTIVITY CYCLES, STUDENTS WILL COLLABORATE WITH AND RECEIVE MENTORSHIP FROM OUR EXTREMELY DIVERSE FACULTY TEAM.

MORATORIUM WAS INSTITUTED ON ALL ELECTIVE CLINICAL SERVICES IN MARCH 2020 TO SLOW THE TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, SAFEGUARD PATIENTS, AND PRESERVE HEALTHCARE RESOURCES. THIS LED TO A MAJOR DISRUPTION IN CANCER SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES. AMONG VETERANS NATIONWIDE, WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT AND PERSISTENT DECREASE IN THE DETECTION OF NEW CANCERS. WITHOUT ROUTINE SCREENING AND EASY ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE, CANCER PATIENTS MAY GO UNDETECTED, ONLY PRESENTING WHEN THE CANCER IS BEYOND CURATIVE THERAPY. THE UNPRECEDENTED COVID-RELATED DISRUPTIONS MAY ALSO HAVE EXACERBATED PREEXISTING DISPARITIES IN CANCER OUTCOMES AMONG DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS. SIGNIFICANCE: WITH NO INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON CANCER OUTCOMES OR CHANGES IN OUTCOME DISPARITIES, HEALTH SYSTEMS CANNOT IDENTIFY POPULATIONS AT RISK OR IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO MITIGATE CURRENT DEFICITS. WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF HOW PANDEMIC DISRUPTIONS TO CANCER CARE ARE AFFECTING CANCER OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION, WE NEED A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO ASSESS CHANGES IN CANCER OUTCOMES OVER TIME, AS THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC EVOLVE AND MITIGATION EFFORTS ARE IMPLEMENTED. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT CANCER OUTCOMES IN THE COVID ERA WILL WORSEN, WITH HIGHER RATES OF 1) MORTALITY, 2) CANCER RECURRENCE, AND 3) METASTATIC DISEASE AT PRESENTATION. ADDITIONALLY, DISPARITIES IN THE ABOVE OUTCOMES WILL BE EXACERBATED IN THE COVID ERA AMONG PATIENTS IN THE FOLLOWING VULNERABLE SUBGROUPS: FEMALE, AGE > 60 YEARS, BLACK, LATINO, RURAL, OR IN ZIP CODES WITH LOWER SES. WE WILL EVALUATE THESE HYPOTHESES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN CANCER OUTCOMES BETWEEN THE COVID AND PRE-COVID ERAS BY CANCER TYPE. 2) IDENTIFY DISPARITIES IN CANCER OUTCOMES AMONG DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS IN THE COVID ERA. METHODOLOGY: USING DETAILED, NATIONWIDE, PATIENT-LEVEL DATA FROM THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION INFORMATICS AND COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE (VINCI), WE WILL EVALUATE CHANGES CANCER OUTCOMES FROM THE PRE-COVID (MARCH 1, 2018 THROUGH FEBRUARY 29, 2020) TO COVID (MARCH 1, 2020 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2025) ERA. POISSON AND COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODELS WILL BE USED TO ANALYSE THE CHANGE FROM THE PRE-COVID TO COVID ERA BY CANCER TYPE AND AMONG VULNERABLE SUBGROUPS. NEXT STEPS/IMPLEMENTATION: THE VINCI DATASET OFFERS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE NEAR REAL-TIME ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACTS OF ONGOING DISRUPTIONS IN NEW CANCER IDENTIFICATION ON CANCER OUTCOMES AND THE EXACERBATION OF EXISTING DISPARITIES IN A HEALTHCARE CRISIS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALLOW US TO DEVELOP ACTIONABLE DATA AND A SYSTEM OF SURVEILLANCE TO GUIDE INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED DISPARITIES.

YET, AIAN PEOPLE HAVE HIGHER INCIDENCE OF SEVERAL POTENTIAL COMORBID CONDITIONS, RELATIVE TO THEIR NON-NATIVE COUNTERPARTS. COMORBIDITIES IMPACT THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF CANCER, INCLUDING WHICH CANCER TREATMENTS A PATIENT RECEIVES AND WHEN THEY RECEIVE THAT TREATMENT. AS A RESULT, CANCER PATIENTS WITH COMORBIDITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE POORER SURVIVAL AND QUALITY OF LIFE THAN THEIR COMORBIDITY-FREE COUNTERPARTS. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO UNDERSTAND PREVALENCE AND IMPACT OF COMORBIDITIES ON CANCER TREATMENT AND OUTCOMES AMONG AIAN PEOPLE; WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION, OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS KNOWN CANCER DISPARITIES IN THIS UNDERSERVED MINORITY POPULATION WILL REMAIN LIMITED.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO UNDERSTAND THE LANDSCAPE OF COMORBIDITIES AMONG AIAN CANCER PATIENTS, AND HOW THEY INFLUENCE CANCER TREATMENT AND SURVIVAL. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT COMORBIDITIES PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE UNDUE BURDEN OF CANCER AMONG AIAN PEOPLE. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY IS THAT UNDERSTANDING THE PREVALENCE OF COMORBIDITIES AMONG AIAN CANCER PATIENTS, AND HOW THEY IMPACT CANCER TREATMENT DELIVERY AND OUTCOMES, WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR MULTI-LEVEL INTERVENTION TARGETING HEALTH SYSTEMS, PROVIDERS, AND/OR PATIENTS. THIS RESEARCH SUPPORTS A LONG-TERM GOAL TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CANCER AMONG AIAN PEOPLE BY REDUCING THE IMPACT OF COMORBIDITIES ON TREATMENT AND SURVIVAL.  TO ADDRESS THIS OBJECTIVE, THIS RESEARCH WILL PURSUE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS, AND ONE EXPLORATORY AIM. THE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL USE THE SEER-MEDICARE LINKED DATABASE TO 1) DETERMINE THE PREVALENCE OF COMORBIDITIES AMONG AIAN PEOPLE AGED OVER 65Y; 2) DETERMINE IMPACT OF COMORBIDITIES ON RECEIPT OF TIMELY AND EVIDENCE- BASED SERVICES DURING DIAGNOSIS, STAGING AND FIRST-LINE TREATMENT AMONG AIAN PEOPLE AGED OVER 65Y; AND, 3) EVALUATE IMPACT OF COMORBIDITIES ON CANCER SURVIVAL AMONG AIAN PEOPLE AGED OVER 65Y. AN EXPLORATORY AIM WILL DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF REPRODUCING THESE ANALYSES IN THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE (IHS) NATIONAL PATIENT INFORMATION REPORTING SYSTEM (NPIRS) DATA WAREHOUSE. THIS RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT USES UNDERUTILIZED DATASETS TO EXPLORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHICH NOTHING IS KNOWN FOR AIAN PEOPLE. FURTHER, WE PROPOSE A COMMUNITY ENGAGED APPROACH TO THIS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS THAT WILL INFORM THIS AND FUTURE WORK.  UPON THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS RESEARCH, THE ROLE THAT PRESENCE AND NUMBER OF COMORBIDITIES PLAYS IN CANCER DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND SURVIVAL AMONG AIAN PEOPLE WILL BE KNOWN.

OBESITY IS A MAJOR RISK FACTOR FOR MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, OSTEOARTHRITIS, AND DEPRESSION, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE AND SHORTENED LIFE SPAN. DESPITE DECADES OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, RACIAL DISPARITIES IN OBESITY PERSIST AND, IN SOME CASES, ARE WIDENING. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING SEGREGATION, DEPRIVATION, AND FOOD ENVIRONMENTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY RISK AND THAT THESE NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS VARY SYSTEMATICALLY BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, A CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC GAP REMAINS IN UNDERSTANDING THE ROOT CAUSE OF OBESITY AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR \u2013 STRUCTURAL RACISM. THE IMPACT OF STRUCTURAL RACISM VIS-A-VIS HISTORICAL RACIALIZED POLICIES AND URBAN PLANNING DECISIONS ON CURRENT DAY INEQUITABLE FOOD ENVIRONMENTS AND OBESITY DISPARITIES HAS RECEIVED LITTLE SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION.

FOR URM RESIDENT PHYSICIANS, GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (GME) LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FACTORS THAT PERPETUATE BIASES DUE TO RACE/ETHNICITY AND GENDER HAVE HIGH POTENTIAL TO HINDER THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION IN MEDICINE. THESE INCLUDE REQUIRED ASSESSMENTS ON RESIDENTS SUBJECTED TO ASSESSMENT BIAS WITHIN THEIR TRAINING PROGRAMS. LITTLE IS KNOWN NATIONALLY ABOUT THE GME LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH URM PHYSICIAN ASSESSMENT BIAS, PARTICULARLY IN THEIR KEY FORMATIVE YEARS AS RESIDENTS AND PRIOR TO BECOMING FULLY LICENSED PHYSICIANS. OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE GME LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FACTORS IMPACTING THE ASSESSMENT OF RESIDENT PHYSICIANS TRAINING IN PRIMARY CARE. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY AND TEST MODIFIABLE FACTORS AMONG URM RESIDENT PHYSICIANS TRAINING IN ALL FAMILY MEDICINE AND INTERNAL MEDICINE GME PROGRAMS USING AN INTEGRATED, MULTILEVEL DATASET SOURCED FROM NATIONAL BODIES. OUR HYPOTHESES CENTER ON A MULTILEVEL CONCEPTUAL MODEL AND PRELIMINARY DATA THAT INCLUDES THE REPRESENTATION OF URM AND GENDER IN THE GME LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, AND HOW PROGRAM- RELATED FACTORS MAY IMPACT THE ASSESSMENTS OF RESIDENTS. USING MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND MULTI-LEVEL GROWTH CURVE MODELING, WE WILL EXAMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH URM REPRESENTATION, GENDER, AND PROGRAM FACTORS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ASSESSMENT BIAS, AND HOW THESE FACTORS MAY IMPACT THE TRAJECTORY OF MEASUREMENTS OF RESIDENT LEARNING IN ACCREDITATION COUNCIL OF GME (ACGME) PHYSICIAN COMPETENCIES FOR ALL U.S. RESIDENTS TRAINING IN ACCREDITED FAMILY MEDICINE AND INTERNAL MEDICINE PROGRAMS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS FOR THIS STUDY ARE 1) EXAMINE WHETHER ASSESSMENT INEQUITIES FOR URM AND WOMEN RESIDENTS IN THE ACGME MILESTONE ASSESSMENTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH REPRESENTATION OF URM AND WOMEN FACULTY, AND 2) EXAMINE HOW MEASUREMENTS OF LEARNING TRAJECTORIES FOR URM AND WOMEN RESIDENTS IN THE ACGME MILESTONE ASSESSMENT RATINGS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAM FACTORS. WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF EXPERTS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION ASSESSMENT, WORKFORCE DIVERSITY, MEDICAL EDUCATION POLICY, AND ANALYTICS, AND EXPECT OUR OUTCOMES TO INFORM NATIONAL LEADERS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE PLANNING TO BETTER SUPPORT URM PHYSICIANS TRAINING IN GME.

EXISTENTIAL ISOLATION (EI) IS A THIRD TYPE OF INTERPERSONAL ISOLATION DEFINED AS THE SUBJECTIVE FEELING THAT OTHERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND ONE\u2019S OWN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES (HELM ET AL., 2019). RESEARCH SUGGESTS EI DIFFERS IN SUBSTANTIVE WAYS FROM LONELINESS AND SOCIAL ISOLATION, INCLUDING INCREMENTAL VALIDITY OVER LONELINESS IN PREDICTING DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE IDEATION (HELM ET AL., 2020). RECENT RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED PARALLELS BETWEEN THE EI AND RURAL MENTAL HEALTH LANDSCAPES (I.E., GREATER PREVALENCE AMONG MEN, LESS INTENTION TO UTILIZE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, ASSOCIATIONS WITH A FRAGMENTED CULTURAL IDENTITY AND COMMUNITY ALIENATION), SUGGESTING EI MAY BE A POTENT PREDICTOR OF RURAL MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES.

INTERVENTIONS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED THAT PREVENT CHRONIC MSP AND REDUCE THESE MSP OUTCOME DISPARITIES.  ONE SAFE, INEXPENSIVE, WIDELY AVAILABLE, AND WELL-TOLERATED INTERVENTION, WITH EXCITING POTENTIAL TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, IS VITAMIN D (VIT D). VIT D INSUFFICIENCY IS MUCH MORE COMMON IN BLACKS THAN WHITES. IN THE CO-PIS\u2019 PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, 77% (103/133) OF BLACK MVC SURVIVORS HAD VIT D INSUFFICIENCY AT THE TIME OF ED EVALUATION. SUCH LOW VIT D LEVELS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED INFLAMMATION AND WORSE PAIN OUTCOMES. VIT D HAS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, NEUROPROTECTIVE, AND ANALGESIC PROPERTIES, AND VIT D TREATMENT IMPROVES PAIN OUTCOMES IN A RANGE OF CONDITIONS. RESULTS OF A RECENT VIT D INTERVENTION STUDY IN ANOTHER TRAUMA POPULATION (BURN SURVIVORS), LED BY CO-PI MAUCK, FOUND THAT VIT D TREATMENT AFTER BURN INJURY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPROVED PAIN OUTCOMES IN BLACK VS. WHITE BURN SURVIVORS (67% VS. 33% PAIN IMPROVEMENT AT 6 WEEKS). RESULTS FROM A RECENT ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY THE CO-PIS SUGGEST THAT VIT D ADMINISTRATION IN THE ED AFTER MVC COULD PREVENT AT LEAST 70,000 BLACKS FROM DEVELOPING CHRONIC POST-MVC MSP ANNUALLY.  THE PROPOSED PILOT RCT (N=90) WILL ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF ADMINISTERING A LONG-ACTING DOSE OF VIT D IN THE ED TO BLACKS AND WHITES PRESENTING WITHIN 24 HOURS OF MVC WITH MODERATE OR SEVERE MSP, ALONG WITH THE ABILITY OF THIS DOSE TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINED INCREASES IN VIT D LEVELS. IN ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL EFFICACY OF THIS INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE MSP OUTCOMES IN BLACKS AND TO REDUCE MSP DISPARITIES IN BLACK VS. WHITE MVC SURVIVORS WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED. PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE A ONE-TIME DOSE OF 300,000 IU ERGOCALCIFEROL OR PLACEBO; THIS DOSE OF ERGOCALCIFEROL RESULTS IN VIT D SUFFICIENCY FOR OVER 3 MONTHS. MSP OUTCOMES DURING THE 3 MONTHS AFTER MVC WILL BE ASSESSED. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERIOD IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS TRANSITION TO MSP RECOVERY VS. CHRONICITY. THIS WORK LEVERAGES CO-PI MAUCK\u2019S VIT D EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING VIT D TRIALS, AND CO-PI MCLEAN\u2019S EXPERIENCE PERFORMING ED-BASED STUDIES OF MVC SURVIVORS.

TGD HEALTH DISPARITIES INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, ELEVATED RATES OF DIABETES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE COMPARED TO RATES FOR CISGENDER POPULATIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE TGD POPULATION IS SUBJECTED TO SOCIETAL EXCLUSION AND NEGATIVE PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT CONTRIBUTES TO EXACERBATING THESE PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, LITTLE TO NO ATTENTION IS PAID TO TGD POPULATIONS WHEN DESIGNING HEALTH PROMOTION CAMPAIGNS FOR CONDITIONS FOR WHICH THIS POPULATION HAS ELEVATED RISK, EVEN THOUGH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH CAMPAIGNS IS WELL-DOCUMENTED FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION. HEALTH PROMOTION MESSAGING THAT CAN ENGAGE TGD PEOPLE IN NEEDED CARE AND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES IS AN ESSENTIAL TOOL IN ADDRESSING THEIR HEALTH DISPARITIES. HOWEVER, LAUNCHING SPECIFIC HEALTH PROMOTION CAMPAIGNS FOR A HOST OF HEALTH CONDITIONS IN HEALTH DISPARATE POPULATIONS, SUCH AS TGD COMMUNITIES, IS NOT FEASIBLE DUE TO THE VOLUME OF SPECIFIC CONDITIONS NEEDING TO BE ADDRESSED INDIVIDUALLY. FURTHERMORE, NATIONAL HEALTH PROMOTION CAMPAIGNS WITH TGD POPULATIONS IN MIND CAN STILL FAIL TO REACH TGD COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL GREAT PLAINS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MATCH THE LIVED REALITY OF THIS REGION WITH THE COMPOUNDING ISSUES OF HIGH STIGMATIZATION, AND LESS ACCESS TO CARE THAN IN COASTAL REGIONS.

REDUCING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN PERIPARTUM PAIN MANAGEMENT AND SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY IS A NATIONAL PRIORITY. NEURAXIAL ANALGESIA (I.E., EPIDURAL OR SPINAL ANALGESIA) IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE TO RELIEVE LABOR PAIN, AND IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCED RISK OF SEVERE OBSTETRIC HEMORRHAGE. IN THE UNITED STATES, SEVERE OBSTETRIC HEMORRHAGE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY WOMEN AND IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE MATERNAL MORBIDITY, PERIPARTUM MATERNAL BLOOD TRANSFUSION, HEMOSTATIC HYSTERECTOMY, AND INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ADMISSION. HOWEVER, LABOR NEURAXIAL ANALGESIA IS UNDERUTILIZED IN UNINSURED RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY WOMEN. INCREASING ACCESS AND UTILIZATION OF LABOR NEURAXIAL ANALGESIA IN UNINSURED RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY WOMEN COULD HELP REDUCE PERIPARTUM DISPARITIES IN PAIN MANAGEMENT AND SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY.

PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS ARE AT RISK OF INJURY FROM ILLNESS, HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT, AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS. IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENT SAFETY RISKS AND EVENTS FREQUENTLY LACKS THE CRITICAL PATIENT PERSPECTIVE. PATIENTS OFTEN RELY ON NURSES TO REPORT THEIR EXPRESSED SAFETY CONCERNS TO THE ORGANIZATION\u2019S INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM (OIRS) FOR FURTHER ACTION AND LEARNING. THIS CAN BE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE PATIENTS MUST RELY ON THEIR NURSE\u2019S JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER THEIR SAFETY CONCERNS ARE VALID AND SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE OIRS FOR FURTHER ACTION. IF NURSES DO NOT JUDGE THE PATIENT\u2019S CONCERN AS CREDIBLE OR IMPORTANT, OR DO NOT REPORT THE PATIENT\u2019S SAFETY CONCERN THROUGH THE OIRS, SAFETY CAN SUFFER THROUGH LACK OF BOTH IMMEDIATE NURSE RESPONSE AND LONG-TERM ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSE. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT NURSES MAY BE BIASED AGAINST CERTAIN PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS. NURSES\u2019 JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF PATIENTS\u2019 SAFETY CONCERNS AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO REPORT THEM MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUCH LIKELY IMPLICIT BIASES.

WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT FOOD INSECURE AA WOMEN WITH OBESITY WILL DEMONSTRATE INCREASED BODY WEIGHT AND CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ENDPOINTS, WHEREAS FOOD SECURE AA WOMEN WITH OBESITY WILL NOT. WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AND CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT. PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONNAIRES WILL ASSESS STRESS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, DECISION-MAKING, AND MOTIVATION; AND AFFECT AND NON-HOMEOSTATIC EATING. PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS WILL INCLUDE CORTISOL, DHEA-S, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, THYROID HORMONES, GLUCOSE, HBA1C, INSULIN, AND ALLOSTATIC LOAD. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST STUDY TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS IN FOOD INSECURE AA WOMEN WITH OBESITY DURING EPISODES OF FOOD INSECURITY. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE A RANGE OF NOVEL DATA THAT WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO WELL-POWERED FOLLOW-UP GRANTS.

WHITE NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WITH SPONTANEOUS LABOR ONSET - PROJECT SUMMARY THE DISPARITY IN PRIMARY CESAREAN BIRTH RATES BETWEEN LOW-RISK BLACK AND WHITE NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WITH A TERM, SINGLE, VERTEX FETUS (NTSV) IN THE UNITED STATES IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. THIS IS CONCERNING BECAUSE NTSV WOMEN ENTER HOSPITALS WITH SIMILAR BASELINE RISKS FOR CESAREAN BIRTH. SAFELY LOWERING THE CESAREAN RATE, ELIMINATING DISPARITIES, AND ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY FOR ALL GROUPS ARE ONGOING NATIONAL PRIORITIES. IT IS UNKNOWN WHY DISPARITIES IN CESAREAN RATES EXIST BETWEEN RACES BUT DIFFERENCES IN LABOR PROGRESS, PROVIDER-LEVEL PRACTICE, OR PROVIDER-PATIENT COMMUNICATION AND DECISION MAKING QUALITY MAY BE CONTRIBUTORY. DYSTOCIA (SLOW, ABNORMAL PROGRESSION OF LABOR) IS THE INDICATION FOR HALF OF CESAREANS AMONG NTSV WOMEN, YET THIS DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORY REMAINS POORLY DEFINED AND PROVIDES A KEY OPPORTUNITY TO SAFELY REDUCE PRIMARY CESAREAN BIRTHS. THERE IS CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE REGARDING WHETHER BLACK AND WHITE NTSV WOMEN HAVE SIMILAR DILATION RATES DURING LABOR. IF RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN LABOR PROGRESS EXIST, THIS WOULD HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR DIAGNOSING DYSTOCIA AND CLINICAL DETERMINATIONS FOR PERFORMING CESAREAN BIRTHS. FURTHERMORE, IT IS UNCLEAR IF PROVIDER APPLICATION OF AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS AND THE SOCIETY FOR MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE GUIDELINES FOR SAFELY PREVENTING PRIMARY CESAREANS ARE APPLIED DIFFERENTLY BASED ON MATERNAL RACE. FINALLY, DISPARATE PROVIDER-PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS AND DECISION MAKING AS WELL AS PROVIDER IMPLICIT BIAS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER CESAREAN RATES FOR BLACK NTSV WOMEN ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN STUDIED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO COMPARE BLACK AND WHITE NTSV WOMEN WITH SPONTANEOUS LABOR ONSET ON (1) LABOR PROGRESS, (2) CARE RECEIVED DURING LABOR, AND (3) INDICATORS OF PROVIDER-PATIENT COMMUNICATION AND DECISION MAKING QUALITY. RETROSPECTIVE AND CROSS- SECTIONAL DATA WILL BE COLLECTED FOR THIS STUDY. LABOR AND BIRTH DATA WILL BE RETROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED FROM BLACK AND WHITE NTSV WOMEN WHO BIRTHED AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER FOLLOWING A PREGNANCY WITH SPONTANEOUS LABOR ONSET SINCE 2015 (N \u02dc 7,150). FOR CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA COLLECTION, BLACK (N = 140) AND WHITE (N = 140) WOMEN WHO BIRTHED FOLLOWING A NTSV PREGNANCY WITH SPONTANEOUS LABOR ONSET WILL BE RECRUITED AND COMPLETE MEASURES DURING THEIR POSTPARTUM HOSPITALIZATIONS.

LABOR ATTENDANT TYPE, MATERNAL AND PREGNANCY CHARACTERISTICS, AND COMMON LABOR INTERVENTIONS WILL BE MODEL COVARIATES. IF STUDY HYPOTHESES ARE SUPPORTED, SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR ASSESSING PROGRESS AND DIAGNOSING DYSTOCIA BASED ON RACE MAY BE NECESSARY FOR CLOSING THE CESAREAN RATE DISPARITY.

RESEARCH ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF FIREFIGHTERS HAS INCREASED OVER THE YEARS, INCLUDING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WOMEN AND RACIAL MINORITIES, BOTH SIGNIFICANT MINORITY GROUPS IN THE FIRE SERVICE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE HEALTH STATUS OF US FIREFIGHTERS WHO IDENTIFY AS A SEXUAL OR GENDER MINORITY (SGM) IS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN. A STUDY FROM THE UK EXAMINED FIRE SERVICE CULTURE AND ITS IMPACT ON SEXUAL MINORITY FIREFIGHTERS AND FOUND A NON-INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT. LAWSUITS MAKING NATIONAL NEWS IN THE US DEPICTS POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT OF SGM FIREFIGHTERS. THE STIGMATIZATION SGM FIREFIGHTERS FACE IN THE WORK ENVIRONMENT MAY LEAD TO CHRONIC STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. SGM INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCE DISPARITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH, AND FIREFIGHTERS EXPERIENCE HIGH RATES OF MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND SUBSTANCE USE. FURTHER, SGM INDIVIDUALS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, AND RECENTLY MORE FIREFIGHTERS DIED FROM SUICIDE THAN IN THE LINE OF DUTY. HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE FIRE SERVICE ENVIRONMENT EXACERBATES MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR SGM FIREFIGHTERS.

A PRIME EXAMPLE IS THE T-SCORE OSTEOPOROSIS DIAGNOSIS CRITERIA, WHICH THE WHO INITIALLY PROPOSED ONLY FOR POSTMENOPAUSAL CAUCASIAN WOMEN IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. HOWEVER, THE T-SCORE DIAG- NOSIS CRITERIA ARE CURRENTLY USED TO HELP WITH OSTEOPOROSIS DIAGNOSIS FOR ALL PATIENTS. THE T-SCORE APPROACH DEFINES THE REFERENCE RANGE (RR) OF BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD). NONETHELESS, CAUCASIANS-BASED RRS CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR NORMAL VARIABILITY IN RACE/ETHNICITY. AS A RESULT, APPLYING THESE CAUCASIAN-BASED RRS TO RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES OFTEN CAUSES ERRORS IN DIAGNOSIS AND RISK ASSESSMENT. WITH A GROWING AND INCREASINGLY DIVERSE MINORITY POPULA- TION IN THE US, CAUCASIAN-BASED CLINICAL GUIDELINES RUN THE RISK OF EXACERBATING RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES. THE EXISTING RRS OF BMD ARE INCREDIBLY CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE MANY PATIENTS WHO SUSTAIN FRAGILITY FRACTURES HAVE A \u201cNORMAL\u201d BMD AS DEFINED BY THE CONVENTIONAL T-SCORE APPROACH. THIS CLINICALLY UTILIZED, CAUCA- SIAN-BASED APPROACH IS FLAWED AND, AS SUCH, CAUSES SYSTEMATIC HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES. THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL APPROACH SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO DEFINE THE RRS OF BMD FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES. SUBSEQUENT RACE/ETHNICITY- ADJUSTED T-SCORE THRESHOLDS REMAIN CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED, SO CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN UNSATISFACTORY ON RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES. HISPANIC WOMEN HAVE A SIMILARLY HIGH FRACTURE RISK AS CAUCASIAN WOMEN; HOWEVER, HISPANIC WOMEN, AS THE MOST HETEROGENEOUS GROUP, HAVE A HIGHER OSTEOPOROSIS MISCLASSIFICATION RATE WITH THE T-SCORE DIAGNOSIS CRITERIA. WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE AND AGING HISPANIC POPULATION, OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES IN HISPANIC WOMEN ARE RAPIDLY BECOMING A SIGNIF- ICANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. HENCE, THIS APPLICATION AIMS TO CREATE PRECISE RRS OF BMD FOR HISPANIC WOMEN TO ADDRESS THIS PRESSING ISSUE. THIS APPLICATION'S CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT NEW PRECISE RRS WILL CLASSIFY OSTEOPO- ROSIS IN HISPANIC WOMEN MORE ACCURATELY THAN CONVENTIONAL THRESHOLDS. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY PURSU- ING THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DEVELOPING THE BEST-PERFORMING MODEL FOR NORMATIVE BMD IN HISPANIC WOMEN; 2) DETERMINING THE PRECISE THRESHOLDS OF BMD; AND 3) EVALUATING THE NEW RRS IN HISPANIC WOMEN. BY REPLACING THE CONVENTIONAL CAUCASIAN-BASED THRESHOLD, THE NOVEL, PRECISE RRS WILL FUNDAMENTALLY SHIFT THE CURRENT RESEARCH AND CLINICAL CARE PARADIGM IN RR FROM ONE FIXED RANGE FOR EVERY PATIENT TO MORE PRECISE THRESHOLDS THAT ACCOUNT FOR MANY INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES. THIS APPLICATION WILL LEVERAGE LARGE SAMPLES OF HISPANIC WOMEN AND INNOVATIVE DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES IN CREATING RACE/ETHNICITY-SPECIFIC, PRECISE RRS OF BMD, THUS SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATING THE CORRESPONDING ROOT CAUSE OF HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES FOR HISPANIC WOMEN. OF INCREASED SIGNIFICANCE, THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED HEREIN CAN BE UTILIZED TO GENERATE MANY OTHER TYPES OF PRECISE RRS FOR VARIOUS MINORITY GROUPS.

FRAMEWORK AND MEASURES OF ACCULTURATION FOR AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS. - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT MEN OF AFRICAN ANCESTRY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY PROSTATE CANCER (CAP) COMPARED TO OTHER RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS, YET THE MAIN DRIVERS OF DISPARATE OUTCOMES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. RESEARCH STUDIES OFTEN CATEGORIZE MEN OF AFRICAN ANCESTRY IN THE UNITED STATES (US) AS A HOMOGENOUS GROUP (BLACKS) WHICH HINDERS UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE UNIQUE HEALTH PRACTICES, BEHAVIORS AND CULTURE OF SUBPOPULATIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OR EXACERBATE DISPARITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS (SSAI) COMPARED TO US-BORN BLACKS HAVE A 1.5 TIMES HIGHER INCIDENCE RATE FOR PROSTATE CANCER. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE HEALTH PRACTICES AND BEHAVIORS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES. ACCULTURATION OR THE NATURE AND EXTENT TO WHICH SSAI MODIFY THEIR, BELIEFS, VALUES, DIET AND OTHER LIFESTYLE PATTERNS MAY IMPACT EARLY DETECTION OF PROSTATE CANCER. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY, WE DEFINE SSAI AS INDIVIDUALS IMMIGRATING FROM THE REGION OF THE AFRICAN CONTINENT LOCATED SOUTH OF THE SAHARAN DESERT. TO DATE, THREE MEASURES EXIST TO ASSESS ACCULTURATION AMONG AFRICAN-DESCENT POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, NONE OF THESE MEASURES INCORPORATE LIFESTYLE FACTORS DESPITE RESEARCH THAT SUGGEST A CHANGE IN ENVIRONMENT AND DIET IS ASSOCIATED WITH PROSTATE CANCER RISK. MOREOVER, EXISTING SCALES ON ACCULTURATION DO NOT CAPTURE THE CONTEXTUAL FEATURES OF ACCULTURATION, SUCH AS EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRECEDING IMMIGRATION AND THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CLIMATE OF THE US UPON ARRIVAL. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE: 1) DEVELOP CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS ILLUMINATING ACCULTURATION, CAP SCREENING AND LIFESTYLE FACTORS AMONG FIRST-GENERATION SSAI MEN IN THE US DIAGNOSED WITH CAP AND HEALTHY FIRST- GENERATION SSAI MEN; 2) CREATE MEASURES TO ASSESS ACCULTURATION, CAP SCREENING AND EARLY DETECTION AMONG SSAI MEN IN THE US; AND 3) TRAIN A CADRE OF STUDENT-RESEARCHERS IN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AIMED AT REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES. TO ADDRESS AIM 1, WE WILL CONDUCT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH 32 SSAI MEN AGED 40-70 YEARS TO IDENTIFY AND ILLUMINATE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF ACCULTURATION AND HOW THEY AFFECT HEALTH BEHAVIORS. WE WILL IDENTIFY ACCULTURATION CONSTRUCTS MISSING IN CURRENT SCALES. TO ACHIEVE AIM 2, WE WILL GENERATE CONTENT AND ITEMS FOR A SCALE INFORMED BY THE CATEGORIES THAT WE DEVELOP IN AIM 1. WE WILL SEEK INPUT FROM AN ADVISORY BOARD OF CONTENT EXPERTS AND REFINE THE SCALE BEFORE FIELD TESTING AND PILOT TESTING OF THE MEASURES. TO ACHIEVE AIM 3, WE WILL INVOLVE STUDENTS IN DATA COLLECTION, DATA ANALYSIS, FIELD AND PILOT TESTING OF THE INSTRUMENT. WE WILL EMPLOY MIXED- METHODS COMBINING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES TO GAIN A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE LINKS BETWEEN ACCULTURATION AND HEALTH BEHAVIOR AMONG SSAI MEN IN THE US. THE SHORT-TERM GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE OF THEORY-GUIDED MEASURES TO ASSESS ACCULTURATION, CAP SCREENING AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS AMONG SSAI MEN IN THE US. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS THAT KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL TRANSLATE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, INNOVATIVE, AND CULTURALLY-BASED INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT REDUCING PROSTATE CANCER DISPARITIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2c000c91-93d3-d5b3-8375-66b4c47344bc-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R15MD017012_7529"}, {"internal_id": 138341222, "Award ID": "R15MD015381", "Award Amount": 450100.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-14", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "REDUCTION OF RISK FACTORS FOR OBESITY AND LINKED CHRONIC DISEASES IN NATIVE AMERICAN EMPLOYEES OF THE TWIN ARROWS CASINO THROUGH A CULTURALLY-RELEVANT MICRONUTRIENT-DENSE PLANT-RICH (MNDPR) DIETARY IN - NATIVE AMERICANS ARE 50% MORE LIKELY TO BE OBESE COMPARED WITH NON-HISPANIC WHITES AND ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. OBESITY AND POOR DIET QUALITY ARE MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR DEVELOPING TYPE II DIABETES, AND NATIVE AMERICANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY POOR PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A CULTURALLY-RELEVANT MICRONUTRIENT-DENSE PLANT-RICH (MNDPR) DIETARY PROTOCOL, WHICH WE WILL THEN USE IN A PILOT, RANDOMLY-CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IMPROVING HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF NATIVE AMERICAN EMPLOYEES OF TWIN ARROWS CASINO. THIS STUDY WILL TRAIN AND EMPLOY NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS OF NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY (NAU) TO IMPLEMENT OUR PROTOCOL AND SERVE AS LIFESTYLE COACHES FOR THE INTERVENTION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE PROTOCOL WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN (I) IMPROVING ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES (WEIGHT, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE), CARDIOMETABOLIC MEASURES (CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, BLOOD GLUCOSE, HEMOGLOBIN A1C (HBA1C), FASTING INSULIN, HSCRP, IGF-1, AND BLOOD PRESSURE), AND WELLNESS MEASURES (ANXIETY, STRESS, SLEEP QUALITY, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND MOOD); AND (II) REDUCING HEALTHCARE COSTS IN NATIVE AMERICAN EMPLOYEES OF TWIN ARROWS CASINO OVER A 1- YEAR PERIOD.

SUMMARY: THE MISSION OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL SOCIETY FOR SPORTS MEDICINE (AMSSM) IS TO BE THE PRE-EMINENT ORGANIZATION FOR PRIMARY CARE SPORTS MEDICINE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE AMSSM COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH NETWORK (CRN) HAS DEVELOPED AND HOSTED TWO RESEARCH SUMMITS IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT RESEARCH NEEDS, BEST PRACTICES AND RESOURCES ON PERTINENT TOPICS IN SPORTS MEDICINE TO THEIR MEMBERSHIP. THESE SUMMITS HAVE BEEN CENTRAL TO CREATING AND FOSTERING COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH WITHIN AMSSM, EDUCATING AMSSM MEMBERS ON IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT HAVE RESEARCH GAPS IN SPORTS MEDICINE AND HIGHLIGHTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL RESEARCH. TANGIBLE OUTCOMES FROM THESE SUMMITS INCLUDED PEER-REVIEWED MANUSCRIPTS, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PRESENTATIONS ON SUMMIT CONCLUSIONS, AND CREATION OF COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH GROUPS. IN APRIL 2023, THE AMSSM CRN, HOUSED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN- MADISON, PLANS TO HOST A RESEARCH SUMMIT FOCUSED ON JUSTICE, EQUITY AND DIVERSITY IN SPORTS MEDICINE. HEALTH DISPARITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS AND AMONG MANY OTHER GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE OBSERVED IN ALL AREAS OF HEALTH CARE AND INCLUDE GAPS IN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION, HEALTH OUTCOMES AND RATES OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THESE DISPARITIES REDUCE LIFE EXPECTANCY AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR MEMBERS OF UNDERSERVED AND UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES. EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES HAVE NOT BEEN PRIORITIZED, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF SPORTS AND EXERCISE MEDICINE (SEM), AND THERE IS LITTLE PUBLISHED LITERATURE FOCUSING ON THIS AREA. RECENT EFFORTS WITHIN SEM HAVE BEEN MADE TO IDENTIFY AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THIS SPACE. HOWEVER, ELIMINATION OF HEALTH DISPARITIES IN SEM WILL REQUIRE IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE CAUSES OF HEALTH DISPARITIES IN ADDITION TO MULTIFACETED AND SUSTAINED APPROACHES FOR HEALTH PROMOTION, DISEASE PREVENTION AND DELIVERY OF APPROPRIATE CARE FOR A DIVERSE POPULATION. THIS RESEARCH CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD AS A PRE-CONFERENCE TO THE AMSSM\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. THE CONFERENCE WILL FOCUS ON PROVIDING EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH TOPICS AND METHODOLOGIES IN SEM THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDERSTUDIED; IT WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR THOUGHTFUL INTERACTION AND SOLUTION-ORIENTED DISCUSSION FROM MULTIPLE PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTING DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS VIA NUMEROUS PANEL SESSIONS AND BREAK-OUT GROUPS. THE RESEARCH CONFERENCE AIMS TO ATTRACT OVER 150 MULTI-DISCIPLINARY INDIVIDUALS, AND RESULTS WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH ACADEMIC JOURNALS, WEBSITES, SOCIAL MEDIA POSTINGS, PODCASTS, AND ANNUAL MEETINGS OF EACH ORGANIZATION AND REPRESENTATIVE\u2014AS WELL AS THROUGH MARKETING CHANNELS OF KEY COMMUNITY GROUPS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONFERENCE, WRITING GROUPS WILL SYNTHESIZE THE DIALOGUES AND DISCUSSIONS AND FINALIZE THEIR RESEARCH AGENDA AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO GUIDE AND PRIORITIZE FUTURE INVESTIGATION AND INNOVATION IN HEALTH DISPARITY RESEARCH IN SEM.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f044e52c-101e-349e-69e4-aaa93e72f7ab-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R13MD018272_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151145034, "Award ID": "R13MD017958", "Award Amount": 50000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-08", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "DEVELOPING A CRITICAL HEALTH EQUITY RESEARCH AGENDA - PROJECT ABSTRACT MANY EXISTING AND EMERGING METHODOLOGIES AND METHODS ARE BEING UTILIZED AND DEVELOPED TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS MULTIPLE FORMS OF OPPRESSION, AND ULTIMATELY HEALTH INEQUITIES, YET THERE ARE FEW SPACES IN WHICH THESE ARE BEING DELIVERED AND DEBATED. FURTHERMORE, WHILE EPISTEMOLOGY IS A CRITICAL STARTING POINT FOR HEALTH EQUITY RESEARCH, DISCUSSIONS ABOUT DIFFERENT EPISTEMOLOGIES ARE ALSO RARE. THIS HAS ALL RESULTED IN CRITICAL GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING, DEVELOPING, AND IMPLEMENTING SUCH IMPORTANT HEALTH EQUITY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE SOLUTIONS.

WHILE THESE EFFORTS APPEAR TO BE HAVING A POSITIVE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT, THEY ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING ECONOMIES, LIMITING PERSONAL RESOURCES FOR BOTH COVID+ AND NON- COVID INFECTED PATIENTS, AND EXACERBATING HEALTH DISPARITIES. COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS REPORT STEADY INCREASES IN CALLS FOR RESOURCES (E.G., FOR FOOD, HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION) DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, PARTICULARLY FROM UNDERSERVED AND UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES, AND ADDITIONAL STRAIN IS BEING PLACED ON HEALTH SYSTEMS.

SOUTHERN STATES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY HIV. AMONG STATES IN THE DEEP SOUTH, WHICH FACE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW HIV INFECTIONS, HIV DIAGNOSIS RATES IN LOUISIANA WERE SECOND ONLY TO GEORGIA. IN NEW ORLEANS, OUR TEAM CONDUCTED THE FIRST POPULATION- BASE HIV SURVEILLANCE STUDY OF TRANS WOMEN AND 46% TESTED POSITIVE FOR HIV. THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MOST RECENT LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (LDH) STD/HIV ANNUAL REPORT IN 2018 THAT IDENTIFIED BLACK GAY/BISEXUAL MEN AND TRANSGENDER WOMEN AS BEARING THE LARGEST BURDEN OF HIV OF ANY POPULATION IN LOUISIANA. DESPITE THE IMPACT OF HIV ON TRANS WOMEN IN NEW ORLEANS, NO EVIDENCE-BASED PREP INTERVENTIONS OR EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS.

WE WILL TAILOR THE PEER NAVIGATION MODEL FROM THE STAY STUDY TO BE IMPLEMENTED DIGITALLY AND ENHANCED USING HEALTH ENAV METHODS. NAMELY, WE WILL ALSO USE MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING AND EMAS TO INCREASE HEALTH CARE EMPOWERMENT AND ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BARRIERS TO PREP UPTAKE AND ADHERENCE. WE WILL RECRUIT 200 TRANS WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR STUDY USING METHODS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN OUR PRIOR HIV RESEARCH WITH TRANS WOMEN. TRANS WOMEN WILL BE ENGAGED IN THE INTERVENTION FOR 12 MONTHS, PROVIDING ENOUGH TIME TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO PREP AND SUPPORT ADHERENCE. THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSED T'CHER, TAKE CHARGE INTERVENTION ARE: (1) TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MEASURE THE IMPACT OF A T'CHER, TAKE CHARGE SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN ON PREP AWARENESS AMONG TRANS WOMEN IN NEW ORLEANS, LA USING A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF TRANS WOMEN; (2) TO TEST THE IMPACT OF THE T'CHER, TAKE CHARGE DIGITAL MHEALTH PEER NAVIGATION MODEL ON INCREASING PREP UPTAKE AND ADHERENCE AMONG TRANS WOMEN IN NEW ORLEANS, LA, USING A RANDOMIZED STEPPED WEDGE CROSS-OVER STUDY DESIGN; AND, (3) TO ASSESS CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE EMPOWERMENT AND SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AS MEDIATING FACTORS IN PREP UPTAKE AND ADHERENCE.

SIMILAR TO THE US OVERALL, MOST IMMIGRANTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LATINO, AND 71% OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE MEXICAN-BORN. THERE IS CONSISTENT EVIDENCE THAT LATINOS HAVE THE WORST PATTERNS OF ACCESS TO AND USE OF HEALTH CARE COMPARED TO ANY OTHER RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUP, AND THESE INEQUITIES ARE EVEN WORSE FOR LATINO IMMIGRANTS, ESPECIALLY FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. EVEN WHEN SAFETY NET PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE FOR IMMIGRANTS, THEY DO NOT ALWAYS OPTIMALLY ENGAGE THEM. IN CALIFORNIA, RECENT STATE POLICIES HAVE ALLOWED INCOME-ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS UNDER THE AGE OF 26 AND OVER THE AGE OF 49 YEARS TO ENROLL IN ITS MEDICAID PROGRAM. RECENT STUDIES, HOWEVER, HAVE SHOWN THAT EVEN WHEN ELIGIBLE, MANY DO NOT ENROLL BECAUSE THEY FEAR DEPORTATION OR DISTRUST THE GOVERNMENT. THIS FEAR AND DISTRUST WERE EXACERBATED IN 2019 WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CHANGED THE DEFINITION OF THE \u201cPUBLIC CHARGE\u201d RULE, WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE DENIAL OF A VISA OR PERMANENT RESIDENCY IF IMMIGRANTS ARE DEPENDENT OR LIKELY TO BECOME DEPENDENT ON PUBLIC BENEFITS INCLUDING MEDICAID.

IN PERSPECTIVE, THAT NUMBER IS MORE THAN THE COMBINED POPULATIONS OF CHICAGO IL, HOUSTON TX, AND PHILADELPHIA PA. BLACK ADULTS TEND TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT ARE MORE SEVERE, PERSIST LONGER, AND HAVE DEBILITATING SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES.

WE WILL OPERATIONALIZE EMPATHY THROUGH TWO MEASURES THAT ARE EACH ASSOCIATED WITH EMPATHY AND TREATMENT OUTCOMES: 1) EMPATHIC ACCURACY, DEFINED AS THE CHW'S ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CLIENT'S STATE; AND 2) INTERPERSONAL PHYSIOLOGICAL SYNCHRONY (IPS), DEFINED AS THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THERAPIST AND CLIENT IPS OVER TIME (I.E., HEART RATE [HR], HR VARIABILITY, GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE, VOICE FEATURES). THIS STUDY USES THESE TWO EMPATHY MEASURES TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPATHY, THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE, AND TREATMENT OUTCOMES. FURTHER, THE STUDY WILL EXPLORE HOW EMPATHY EFFECTS CHANGE BASED ON THE RACE AND GENDER CONCORDANCE/DISCORDANCE OF THERAPIST-CLIENT DYADS.

FOR THE CHILDREN, MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR ACTIVE LEARNING AND PLAY MAY INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR CARDIOMETABOLIC PROFILES OF CHILDREN AND MAY HELP ADDRESS OBESITY-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES. THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE ALREADY EVIDENT IN CHILDREN IN THE TWO NEIGHBORHOODS BEING IMPACTED BY THIS CITY-LED PROGRAM WITH HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF SEVERE OBESITY BY 4TH GRADE (BODY MASS INDEX EXCEEDING 120% OF THE 95TH PERCENTILE) THAN OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE CITY AND STATE. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH GREEN SCHOOLYARD IMPROVEMENTS CAN REDUCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OBESITY- RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES, AS WELL AS IMPROVE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AND COMMUNITY WELL-BEING. A GROWING LITERATURE ON THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF GREENER ENVIRONMENTS SUGGESTS THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AIR QUALITY, SLEEP, AND SOCIAL BEHAVIORS ARE INTERTWINED PATHWAYS THAT MAY PROTECT AGAINST EXCESS WEIGHT GAIN. DATA WILL BE COLLECTED ON OUTCOMES RELATED TO THESE PATHWAYS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE GREEN SCHOOLYARD TRANSFORMATIONS FROM CHILDREN IN THE TWO PROGRAM SCHOOLS AND IN COMPARABLE NON-PROGRAM SCHOOLS WITHIN THE LITTLE ROCK SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE STUDY IS DESIGNED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PATHWAYS WORK IN COMBINATION AND WHETHER GREENER SCHOOLYARDS INFLUENCE PATTERNS OF PLAY IN WAYS THAT IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AMONG CHILDREN WHO ARE AT GREATER RISK FOR DEVELOPING SEVERE OBESITY. COMMUNITY AND SCHOOL-LEVEL BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GREEN SCHOOLYARD INTERVENTION WILL ALSO BE IDENTIFIED TO INFORM FUTURE INITIATIVES. ANOTHER STRENGTH OF THIS STUDY LIES IN THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS TO THE GREENSPACE IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE TWO SCHOOLS. THIS ALLOWS FOR A RICHER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREENSPACE AND DIFFERENCES IN IMPLEMENTATION AFFECT THESE PATHWAYS. THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM LITTLE ROCK\u2019S GREEN SCHOOLYARDS PROGRAM WILL INFORM PRAGMATIC AND COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT SLOW THE GROWTH OF SEVERE CHILDHOOD OBESITY IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND REDUCE OBESITY-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d72b9a8b-635d-44cc-45e8-3f90e8ee45f3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01MD018192_7529"}, {"internal_id": 152370361, "Award ID": "R01MD018187", "Award Amount": 1417971.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-26", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "INTEGRATED NAVIGATION SERVICES FOR TREATMENT ADHERENCE, COUNSELING, AND RESEARCH (INSTACARE) - PROJECT SUMMARY: THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A CLINIC-INTEGRATED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER (CHW) INTERVENTION ON HIV OUTCOMES AMONG BLACK PEOPLE WITH POORLY MANAGED HIV. MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, IS AN HIV EPICENTER WHERE BLACK ADULTS ACCOUNT FOR 17% OF THE POPULATION AND 64% OF AIDS- RELATED DEATHS. THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES ARISE FROM THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH), THE MODIFIABLE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE GROW, LIVE, WORK, AND AGE. AMONG BLACK PEOPLE, NEGATIVE SDOH LIMIT HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND FOSTER RACIAL INEQUITIES. IN MIAMI-DADE, BLACK PEOPLE ACCOUNT FOR ~60% OF THE HOMELESS, ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO LIVE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL, AND THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE UNEMPLOYED COMPARED TO THE NON-BLACK POPULATION. THESE DISPARITIES HIGHLIGHT THE CRITICAL NEED FOR MULTI-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS THAT AMELIORATE THE IMPACT OF THE SDOH ON THIS POPULATION. ACCORDINGLY, THIS APPLICATION AIMS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF THE CHW INTERVENTION ON THE IMPACT OF THE SDOH AND SYSTEM-LEVEL FACTORS ON HIV OUTCOMES.  FOR OVER 15 YEARS, THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI HAS SUPPORTED RESEARCH ON CHW INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE HIV DISPARITIES. OUR EARLIER WORK FOUND BLACK PLH RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE COMMUNITY BASED CHW SUPPORT FOR 12 MONTHS IMPROVED RATES OF VIRAL SUPPRESSION VS. THOSE RECEIVING STANDARD HIV CARE. FURTHER RESEARCH FOUND CLINIC BASED CHW SUPPORT ALSO LED TO IMPROVED HIV OUTCOMES AMONG BLACK PLH.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS APPLICATION ARE TO 1) COMPARE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM HARM REDUCTION AND ABUSE LIABILITY POTENTIAL (I.E., WITHDRAWAL, CRAVING, DEPENDENCE) OF A NSPS EC IN AA EXCLUSIVE EC, DUAL CIG-EC, AND EXCLUSIVE CIG USERS, 2) CHARACTERIZE FACTORS THAT PREDICT WHO SWITCHES FULLY, PARTIALLY, OR NOT AT ALL, AND 3) EXAMINE IF HARM REDUCTION CAN BE FURTHER ENHANCED BY TREATING DUAL USERS WITH VAR TO ELIMINATE CIGARETTE SMOKING. OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY CONDUCTING A 6-WEEK OPEN- LABEL TRIAL OF A NSPS EC AND COUNSELING TO FACILITATE A COMPLETE SWITCH TO EC IN AA CIGARETTE SMOKERS (N=500) WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN QUITTING ALL NICOTINE PRODUCTS BUT ARE INTERESTED IN SWITCHING TO EC. WE ENHANCE HARM REDUCTION POTENTIAL AND CAPITALIZE ON A MISSED OPPORTUNITY BY OFFERING DUAL USERS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO MAKE A COMPLETE SWITCH. AT SIX WEEKS, THOSE WHO ARE DUAL USERS (N= ~221) WILL RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL 12 WEEKS OF THE NSPS EC, ONGOING COUNSELING TO MAKE A COMPLETE SWITCH, AND BE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE 12 WEEKS OF VAR OR PLACEBO (PBO) TO SUPPORT QUITTING COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES. FOLLOW-UP WILL CONTINUE FOR ONE-YEAR, PROVIDING, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THE FIRST EVIDENCE ON THE LONG-TERM HARM REDUCTION POTENTIAL OF NSPC EC. THE CURRENT STUDY IS THE FIRST TO EXAMINE THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM HARM REDUCTION POTENTIAL OF NSPS EC IN A PRIORITY POPULATION AND THE FIRST TO EXAMINE PHARMACOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR DUAL CIG-EC USERS IN MAKING A COMPLETE SWITCH TO EC. FINDINGS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT EC AS A HARM REDUCTION STRATEGY AMONG A DISPARATE GROUP THAT ARGUABLY STANDS TO BENEFIT FROM IT THE MOST, CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL GOAL OF REDUCING TOBACCO-RELATED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, AND NARROW THE HEALTH DISPARITY GAP FOR AA SMOKERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KS", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1a1108fb-0099-a708-6def-aa6d101c8ba8-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01MD018123_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160940717, "Award ID": "R01MD018118", "Award Amount": 663504.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-07-07", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "DEVELOPMENT OF AN INSTRUMENT FOR ASSESSMENT OF INDIGENOUS HISTORICAL TRAUMA AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH AMONG AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE POPULATIONS - ABSTRACT AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE (AI/AN) POPULATIONS EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE U.S. FOR ANY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP.

STRUCTURAL RACISM CAPTURES UPSTREAM HISTORIC RACIST EVENTS (SUCH AS SLAVERY, BLACK CODE LAWS, JIM CROW LAWS, AND SCHOOL SEGREGATION) AND MORE RECENT STATE SANCTIONED RACIST LAWS IN THE FORM OF REDLINING. REDLINING REFERS TO THE PRACTICE OF SYSTEMATICALLY DENYING VARIOUS SERVICES TO RESIDENTS OF SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS/COMMUNITIES, OFTEN BASED ON RACE/ETHNICITY (BAILEY 2020).  A FIRST IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN HISTORIC REDLINING AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IS LIKELY RELATED TO HEALTH CARE ACCESS IN THE FORM OF ACCESSIBLE HOSPITAL AND NEIGHBORHOOD CLINICS, AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF THESE FACILITIES. A SECOND IMPORTANT LINKAGE BETWEEN HISTORIC REDLINING AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IS LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH STRUCTURAL RACISM (IN THE FORM OF REDLINING) HAS SYSTEMATICALLY DEPRIVED NEIGHBORHOODS OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, AND AS SUCH, OF THE ABILITY TO BUILD INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY ASSETS IN THE FORM OF HOUSING VALUE, EMPLOYMENT, AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS RESIDENTS.

SOMETIMES CLINICIANS PRESCRIBE MORE EXPENSIVE AGENTS WHEN LESS COSTLY, EQUALLY EFFECTIVE MEDICATIONS EXIST, IN PART BECAUSE, UNTIL RECENTLY, THEY LACKED INFORMATION REGARDING WHAT PATIENTS MUST PAY FOR A PARTICULAR DRUG. OOP COST INFORMATION COULD ALSO HELP PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS MAKE TREATMENT CHOICES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH PATIENT PREFERENCES AND GOALS.

MEDICARE POLICY SUPPORTS RTBTS AND WILL INCREASE ITS IMPLEMENTATION. BECAUSE COST- RELATED MEDICATION UNDERUSE IS SIGNIFICANT AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY AND RURAL POPULATIONS, A RTBT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE GUIDELINE-CONCORDANT CARE IN THESE POPULATIONS AND DECREASE DISPARITIES.

THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICAID EXPANSION AND RURAL-URBAN ETHNORACIAL DISPARITIES, WHILE ALSO ESTIMATING THE MEDIATING ROLE OF POVERTY ALLEVIATION IN THIS RELATIONSHIP. THIS STUDY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT: 1) FOCUSES ON MORTALITY DISPARITY REDUCTION INSTEAD OF THE SIMPLE REDUCTION OF MORTALITY, 2) ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF MEDICAID EXPANSION ON INTERSECTIONAL MORTALITY DISPARITIES, MEANING DISPARITIES FOUND AT THE INTERSECTION OF MULTIPLE HEALTH DISPARITY POPULATIONS (E.G.

HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT IS THE BIOLOGICAL IMPACT OF RACIAL TRAUMA. THERE IS AN INCREASING AWARENESS THAT SRD IS A SALIENT MECHANISM PERPETUATING RACIAL GAPS IN HEALTH AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS. IN PARTICULAR, STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THE IMPACT OF SRD ON NEGATIVE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES, INCLUDING HIGHER RATES OF PRETERM BIRTH AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN (AA) WOMEN AND HIGHER RATES OF MORTALITY AMONG BLACK MOTHERS AND INFANTS. THESE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH ARE PERVASIVE EVEN AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR SOCIO- ECONOMIC STATUS AND EDUCATION; AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PERSIST TRANSGENERATIONALLY, POSSIBLY VIA EPIGENETIC INFLUENCES. IN THIS STUDY, WE SEEK TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF RACE AND TRANSGENERATIONAL SRD-RELATED TRAUMA AMONG AA WOMEN ON DISTINCT EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS AT THE MATERNAL-FETAL INTERFACE THAT ARE LINKED TO ALTERED IMMUNE CELL DEVELOPMENT, ACTIVATION, AND SIGNALING IN THE PLACENTA AND DEVELOPING FETUS. STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE PLACENTA MAY BE THE GATEWAY OF MATERNAL TRANSGENERATIONAL EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE.

MOREOVER, NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES (E.G., DRUG USE) ARE EVEN HIGHER FOR HSMY WHO DISCLOSE TO PARENTS WHO ARE UNACCEPTING OF THEIR SEXUAL MINORITY YOUTH. IN FACT, YOUTH DISCLOSURE INITIATES A TRANSITION PROCESS WHERE PARENTS MAY STRUGGLE TO ADJUST TO YOUTH BEING A SEXUAL MINORITY, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO POOR FAMILY FUNCTIONING (E.G., POOR COMMUNICATION AND LOW FAMILY SUPPORT). FURTHER, SOME PARENTS MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR YOUTH AND ADOLESCENTS MAY LACK THE NEEDED SKILLS TO MANAGE STRESS AND NEGATIVE REACTIONS THAT MAY HAVE REVERBERATING PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS. GIVEN THE IMPACT OF THESE CO-OCCURRING FACTORS, IT IS CRITICAL TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE FAMILY-BASED PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT OR REDUCE THE ADVERSE HEALTH RISKS THAT HSMY FACE. INTERVENTIONS NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCES OF HSMY AND THEIR FAMILIES, INCLUDING THE INTERPLAY OF RACISM AND HOMOPHOBIA, CULTURAL VALUES, FAMILY REJECTION/SUPPORT, FAMILY FUNCTIONING, AND INDIVIDUAL LEVEL VARIABLES.

WHILE EXPLICIT REDLINING IS NOW PROHIBITED UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT OF 1968, THE RESIDUAL EFFECTS OF RESIDENTIAL REDLINING ENSURES THAT THE SAME AREAS WITH EXPOSURE TO HISTORIC STRUCTURAL RACISM ARE TO THIS DAY DISPROPORTIONATELY INHABITED BY RESIDENTS THAT ARE UNDULY SUBJECT TO WORSE SOCIAL RISK FACTORS (DEFINED ACROSS: HOUSING INSTABILITY; FOOD INSECURITY; TRANSPORT NEEDS; ECONOMIC NEEDS; AND SAFETY), LOWER HUMAN CAPITAL (DEFINED AS THE TOTALITY OF INDIVIDUALS\u2019 KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS), AND LOWER HEALTH CARE RESOURCES (DEFINED AS THE MEDICAL RESOURCE CAPABILITIES OF AREAS WHICH ENABLE THEM TO HANDLE BROAD AND COMPLEX MEDICAL EVENTS/CASES) (BRILLIOUX 2017, BAILEY 2021, HIDALGO 2021); AND THAT REDLINING MAY PRESENT AN IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN HISTORIC STRUCTURAL RACISM AND PRESENT DAY DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES (DEFINED ACROSS: MORTALITY, HEALTH CARE COST, HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION) (EGEDE 2020).

THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF STRUCTURAL RACISM IS RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION, THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOCIAL GROUPS LIVE SEPARATELY FROM ONE ANOTHER WITHIN A SPECIFIED GEOGRAPHIC AREA. SEGREGATION IS A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL, COMPLEX CONSTRUCT THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO RACIAL DISPARITIES ACROSS MANY DOMAINS.

BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION THAT A) SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE\u2019S LONG-TERM EFFECTS EXTEND WELL BEYOND THE LIFESPAN OF DIFFERENTIATED CELLS, WHOSE REPLENISHMENT OCCURS ONLY FROM STEM/PROGENITOR CELLS, AND B) CAN BE PERPETUATED ACROSS GENERATIONS, WE ADVANCE THE NOVEL HYPOTHESIS THAT THE ORIGINS OF HEALTH DISPARITIES MAY EXTEND ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF STEM CELLS, AND SPECIFICALLY TO THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE EXPOSURE ON OFFSPRING STEM CELLS DURING EMBRYONIC/FETAL LIFE. OUR PROPOSED STUDY WILL FOCUS ON DISPARITIES BETWEEN HISPANIC, NON-HISPANIC BLACK, AND NON-HISPANIC WHITE MOTHERS AND THEIR NEWBORNS IN OBESITY AND METABOLIC PHENOTYPES; ON MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR/STROMAL CELLS (MSCS) AND MSC- DERIVED ADIPOCYTES AS THE STEM AND DIFFERENTIATED CELLS OF INTEREST; ON MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION, ADIPOGENIC PROPENSITY/ACTIVITY AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY AS THE KEY INTRACELLULAR PROCESSES OF IMPORTANCE; ON NEWBORN ADIPOSE TISSUE MASS AND GLUCOSE-INSULIN REGULATION AS THE OUTCOMES OF SIGNIFICANCE; AND ON MATERNAL-FETAL GESTATIONAL BIOLOGY AS THE PROXIMATE TRANSMISSION PATHWAY. WE WILL CONDUCT THIS STUDY IN A COHORT OF N=240 CHILD-MOTHER DYADS; ISOLATE AND CULTURE FETAL MSCS FROM NEWBORN CORD TISSUE; PERFORM HIGH-RESOLUTION CELLULAR EXPERIMENTS; AND CHARACTERIZE NEONATAL PHENOTYPES IN VITRO IN MSC-DERIVED ADIPOCTYES, AND IN VIVO USING WHOLE BODY DENSITOMETRY. AIM 1 WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH NEWBORN MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL CHARACTERISTICS, I.E., REDUCED MITOCHONDRIAL EFFICIENCY, INCREASED ADIPOGENIC PROPENSITY, AND REDUCED INSULIN SENSITIVITY. AIM 2 WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT VARIATION IN MA- TERNAL AND FETAL GESTATIONAL BIOLOGY (COMPOSITE MEASURES OF ENDOCRINE, IMMUNE/INFLAMMATORY, AND METABOLIC LIGANDS) MEDIATES THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE ON NEWBORN MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS. AIM 3 WILL ESTABLISH THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF VARIATION IN MSC CHARACTERISTICS FOR NEONATAL OBESITY-RELATED PHENOTYPES AT THE A) CELLULAR LEVEL (MSC- DERIVED ADIPOCYTE SIZE AND FAT CONTENT; MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION; ADIPOGENIC ACTIVITY), AND B) WHOLE-BODY LEVEL (PERCENT FAT MASS AND SYSTEMIC INSULIN SENSITIVITY). AIM 4 (EXPLORATORY) WILL ELUCIDATE POTENTIALLY MODIFIABLE MATERNAL PSYCHOSOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS THAT RELATE TO THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW- BORN MSC BIOLOGY. AIM 5 WILL ESTABLISH A SHARED REPOSITORY (BIOBANK) OF MSC, CORD BLOOD, CORD AND PLACENTAL TISSUE SAMPLES FOR FUTURE STUDIES OF MOLECULAR MECHANISMS (GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES, EPIGENETIC CHARACTERISTICS) AND IN VITRO CELL DIFFERENTIATION ANALYSES.

RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY CSHCN ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THESE HEALTH CONDITIONS AND LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THEM DIAGNOSED AND TREATED COMPARED WITH OTHER CSHCN. DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO CARE CONTRIBUTE TO DISPARITIES IN USE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT, AND INADEQUATE INSURANCE LEADS TO POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG CSHCN. EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF CSHCN OVER THEIR LIFETIMES. YET, MANY RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY FAMILIES OF CSHCN EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES IN ACCESSING NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. DISPARITIES IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES CAN BE MITIGATED BY EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE AND ENCOURAGING USE OF TREATMENT. ADDRESSING THESE MECHANISMS EARLY IN LIFE IS CRITICAL TO MITIGATE HEALTH DISPARITIES OVER THE ENTIRE LIFE COURSE.  THERE IS MIXED EVIDENCE ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH GENERAL INSURANCE EXPANSIONS REDUCE DISPARITIES, AND SOME STUDIES EVEN FIND THAT RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN COVERAGE AND HEALTH SERVICE USE INCREASED AFTER RECENT HEALTH INSURANCE EXPANSIONS.

USING LONGITUDINAL DATA FOR ALL DIALYSIS PATIENTS IN PUERTO RICO FROM THE US RENAL DATA SYSTEM AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH PROVIDERS AND CLINIC STAFF, OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1) EXAMINE LONG-TERM TRENDS IN OUTMIGRATION AMONG PERSONS WITH KIDNEY FAILURE IN PUERTO RICO, PRE- AND POST-HURRICANE MARIA. OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT HURRICANE MARIA INCREASED OUT-MIGRATION OF KIDNEY FAILURE PATIENTS RELATIVE TO THE PRE-DISASTER PERIOD; 2) ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF HURRICANE MARIA ON MORTALITY AND HOSPITALIZATIONS AMONG MIGRANT AND NON- MIGRANT PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY FAILURE, PRE- AND POST-MARIA. OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT FOLLOWING MARIA, PERSONS WHO MIGRATED OUTSIDE OF PUERTO RICO WILL EXPERIENCE INCREASED MORTALITY AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS COMPARED TO PERSONS WHO DID NOT MIGRATE OUT OF PUERTO RICO; AND 3) EXAMINE DIALYSIS PROVIDERS' STRATEGIES AND PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO MITIGATING THE HURRICANE'S EFFECTS ON PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY FAILURE AND UNDERSTAND THE LONG- TERM CONSEQUENCES FOR DIALYSIS PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS AND STAFF THROUGH QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS. WE EXPECT THESE INTERVIEWS WILL PROVIDE IN-DEPTH, NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO PROVIDERS' STRATEGIES TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF CARE AND AVOID DIALYSIS FACILITY CLOSURES.

HIGH RATES OF COVID-19 IN CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS ARE LINKED TO HIGH RATES IN SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY IN JAILS WITH HIGH POPULATION TURNOVER AND IN COMMUNITIES WHERE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WORK. VACCINATION IN CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS IS AN IMPORTANT COMMUNITY-WIDE COVID-19 MITIGATION STRATEGY.

WHILE MANY STRESSFUL EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CANNOT BE AVOIDED, ADAPTIVE COPING CAN MITIGATE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF STRESS EXPOSURE.

AFRICAN AMERICANS (AAS) WHO REPRESENT 13% OF U.S POPULATION, DEVELOP END STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE AT 3.5-FOLD HIGHER RATES THAN EUROPEAN AMERICANS, EXPLAINING WHY 31% OF PEOPLE WITH END STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE (ESKD) ARE AAS. TWO PROTEIN CODING MUTATIONS IN THE APOLIPOPROTEIN L1 (APOL1) GENE ARE THE CAUSAL DRIVERS OF 70% OF THIS EXCESS RISK OF ESKD IN AAS. DESPITE THE URGENT NEED FOR TREATMENT OF APOL1-ASSOCIATED KIDNEY DISEASE (AAKD), THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY THERAPEUTIC TRIALS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON AAKD. THIS NEED IS COMPOUNDED BY SEVERE UNDERREPRESENTATION OF AAS IN CLINICAL TRIALS. UNTIL THESE NEEDS ARE MET, DISPARITIES IN KIDNEY HEALTH IN THE US WILL PERSIST. OUR LONG- TERM GOAL IS TO DEVELOP TARGETED THERAPIES FOR THE TWO MOST COMMON FORMS OF AAKD: APOL1-ASSOCIATED FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (FSGS) AND HYPERTENSION-INDUCED CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (HTN-CKD) IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE DISPARATE BURDEN OF ESKD AMONG AAS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PARTICULAR APPLICATION IS TO TARGET A PROXIMAL PATHWAY THAT DRIVES APOL1-INDUCED PODOCYTE INJURY, WHICH IS A CENTRAL MECHANISM OF AAKD. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT INHIBITION OF JAK1 AND JAK2 KINASES WILL BLOCK APOL1-INDUCED PODOCYTE INJURY, AND PROTEINURIA, AND THEREBY MITIGATE PROGRESSION OF AAKD TO ESKD. THIS HYPOTHESIS HAS BEEN FORMULATED ON THE BASIS OF PRELIMINARY DATA PRODUCED IN THE APPLICANT\u2019S LABORATORIES. THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS THAT DISCOVERY OF AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR AAKD WILL REDUCE DISPARITIES IN ESKD INCIDENCE, THE HIGH COST OF ESKD CARE, AND THE ENORMOUS LOSS OF LIVES ASSOCIATED WITH ESKD\u2014WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY AS MUCH LOSS OF LIFE-YEARS AS BREAST CANCER IN WOMEN AND MORE LOSS OF LIFE-YEARS THAN COLORECTAL CANCER IN MEN.

AMERICAN INDIANS (AIS) EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL DIET-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES: AI ADULTS ARE 50% MORE LIKELY TO BE OBESE, 30% MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HYPERTENSION, AND TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAVE DIABETES COMPARED TO WHITES. IN 2013, THE OSAGE NATION IN OKLAHOMA LAUNCHED BIRD CREEK FARM (BCF) WITH THE MISSION TO FACILITATE INDIGENOUS FOOD SOVEREIGNTY, DEFINED AS THE RIGHT AND RESPONSIBILITY OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES TO HEALTHY AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FOODS PRODUCED THROUGH TRADITIONAL INDIGENOUS PRACTICES. BY 2015, BCF HAD 12 EMPLOYEES AND BEGAN PROVIDING FOOD TO TRIBAL PROGRAMS. IN THE SAME YEAR, IN COLLABORATION WITH BCF, OUR TEAM LAUNCHED THE NIMHD-FUNDED FRESH FARM-TO-SCHOOL PROGRAM (R01MD011266). PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM THIS TRIBALLY-DRIVEN COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR) STUDY SHOW AN INCREASE IN VEGETABLE AND FRUIT INTAKE AMONG CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND A DECREASE IN FOOD INSECURITY.

THE DELAY GENERATES HEALTH DISPARITIES BECAUSE RACIAL MINORITY AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED PATIENTS ARRIVE LATER THAN WHITE PATIENTS LEADING TO LESS ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND WORSE OUTCOMES. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR DELAY IS THE TIME SPENT BY THE PATIENT AND WITNESSES WHO DECIDE TOGETHER TO WATCH-AND-WAIT OR GO TO THE HOSPITAL. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE THAT SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS IS A MAJOR DETERMINANT OF THE DELAY PHENOMENON. OUR TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SOCIAL NETWORK STRUCTURE AROUND A SPECIFIC PATIENT DETERMINES THE FLOW OF INFORMATION THAT LEADS TO DECISIONS TO ACT RAPIDLY OR SLOWLY. PATIENTS WHO ARRIVED EARLY HAD LARGE AND LOOSELY CONNECTED NETWORKS, WHILE THOSE WHO ARRIVED LATE HAD SMALL AND CLOSE-KNIT NETWORKS. WHAT REMAINS LACKING, HOWEVER, IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTENT OF THE SOCIAL NETWORK EFFECT IN A MORE DIVERSE POPULATION OF STROKE PATIENTS, ITS MECHANISM, AND TRANSLATION INTO INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE STROKE DELAY AND DISPARITIES. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS CRITICAL TO ESTABLISHING RIGOR AND PREMISE FOR FUTURE SOCIAL NETWORK INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT REDUCING DISPARITIES IN STROKE OUTCOMES. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO DESIGN NETWORK-BASED INTERVENTIONS THAT REDUCE DELAY DURING STROKE AND ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THERAPIES. THEREFORE, IN THIS PROJECT, WE USE A DUAL EMPIRICAL AND SOCIAL SIMULATION APPROACH TO CHARACTERIZE AND MODEL SOCIAL NETWORK EFFECTS IN A DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATION. IN AIM 1, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER SOCIAL NETWORKS AFFECT DELAY IN HOSPITAL ARRIVAL AFTER STROKE DIFFERENTIALLY BY RACE AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. WE WILL CAPTURE SOCIAL NETWORK DATA AND TIME TO ARRIVAL IN 500 RACIALLY AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY DIVERSE PATIENTS DURING THEIR HOSPITAL ADMISSION. IN AIM 2, WE WILL MODEL THE POTENTIAL OF NETWORK INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE STROKE DELAY IN AT-RISK POPULATIONS. USING DATA FROM THE SAME 500 PATIENTS AND PERSONS IN THEIR NETWORK, WE WILL PARAMETERIZE AN AGENT-BASED MODEL TO REPRESENT THE DYNAMIC DECISION-MAKING WITHIN THE SOCIAL NETWORK DURING STROKE. THEN WE WILL EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF NETWORK INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE DELAY AND DISPARITIES WITHIN THE MODEL. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT SOCIAL NETWORK METRICS WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH HOSPITAL ARRIVAL TIME, SOCIAL NETWORKS WILL MODERATE RACE AND SES DIFFERENCES IN ARRIVAL TIME, AND THAT NETWORK INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS INCREASING NETWORK SIZE WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES IN SOCIAL SIMULATIONS.

MOREOVER, MANY OBESOGENIC BEHAVIORS IN ADULTHOOD, LIKE TELEVISION VIEWING AND CONSUMPTION OF SUGARY DRINKS, BEGIN AT THIS AGE. THE MOST EFFECTIVE CHILDHOOD OBESITY INTERVENTIONS ARE THOSE ROOTED IN BEHAVIOR AND FAMILY SYSTEMS THEORIES. BOTH OF THESE THEORIES PROVIDE APPROACHES TO SUPPORT LIFESTYLE CHANGES WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT FAMILY IS THE MAJOR MEDIATOR OF SOCIAL INFLUENCES ON A CHILD\u2019S DEVELOPMENT.

IN THE US, 7.3 MILLION ADULTS WITH T2D AND 74.5 WITH PREDIABETES (PDM) REMAIN UNDIAGNOSED. IN SPITE OF OPPORTUNISTIC SCREENING IN CLINICAL PRACTICE, NEARLY ONE-THIRD OF PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS HAVE UNDIAGNOSED DYSGLYCEMIA (PDM + T2D). TO CLOSE SCREENING GAPS, NEW STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED. WE ADAPT EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES FROM CANCER SCREENING TO CONCEPTUALIZE T2D SCREENING AS A MULTI-STEP PROCESS (RISK ASSESSMENT, SCREENING INVITATION, TEST ORDERING, AND TEST COMPLETION) REQUIRING COORDINATION ACROSS PATIENT, PROVIDER, AND HEALTH SYSTEM INTERFACES. WE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED THE PARKLAND DYSGLYCEMIA DETECTION PROGRAM (PDDP) \u2013 AN EHR-BASED, MULTICOMPONENT POPULATION HEALTH T2D SCREENING INTERVENTION THAT AUTOMATES RISK ASSESSMENT, BULK ORDERS SCREENING TESTS, AND FACILITATES BULK PATIENT OUTREACH VIA SCREENING INVITATIONS.

IN OUR PDDP PILOT STUDY, A SINGLE, GENERIC \u2018OVERDUE FOR SCREENING\u2019 INVITATION HAD A 41% RESPONSE RATE VS. 13% IN USUAL CARE ALONE. OF THOSE COMPLETING SCREENING, 37% HAD PDM AND 5% HAD T2D, REPRESENTING CASES \u2018MISSED\u2019 BY OPPORTUNISTIC SCREENING ALONE. ALTHOUGH THE PDDP HELPED CLOSE OVERALL SCREENING GAPS AND DETECTED CASES OF UNDIAGNOSED DYSGLYCEMIA, RESPONSE RATES TO GENERIC INVITATIONS WERE SIMILAR ACROSS RACIAL/ETHNIC SUBGROUPS (HISPANICS 42%; NH BLACKS 41%; NH WHITES 39%) AND THOSE WITH KNOWN PDM VS.

IN THE ABSENCE OF METASTATIC DISEASE, SURGERY IS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR MORE THAN 90% OF CRC PATIENTS. INSIGHT FROM EXISTING LITERATURE AND OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE MOST ESSENTIAL SURGICAL DISPARITIES IN CRC ARE RELATED TO RACE EFFECTS IN SURGICAL RISK AND STRONG HOSPITAL- ASSOCIATED DIFFERENCES IN MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN CRC SURGICAL OUTCOMES EXISTS ACROSS HOSPITALS (E.G. MORTALITY RATES 0.6%-14.7%) WITH KNOWN DISPARITIES ADVERSELY AFFECTING BLACK PATIENTS. BLACK PATIENTS HAVE LOWER SURGICAL UTILIZATION RATES, WORSE SURGICAL OUTCOMES, AND LOWER SURVIVAL RATES COMPARED TO WHITE PATIENTS. BLACK PATIENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE LOWER QUALITY, LOWER VOLUME HOSPITALS FOR SURGERY, EVEN WHEN A HIGHER QUALITY CHOICE CAN BE FOUND CLOSER TO HOME. THESE DISPARITIES EXTEND BEYOND RACE TO RESIDENTIAL SETTING (E.G. RURAL) AND OTHER PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS. ACCESS TO HIGHER QUALITY HOSPITALS IS A CRITICAL BARRIER TO ACHIEVING SURGICAL EQUITY ACROSS THE POPULATION. DATA TO DRIVE HOSPITAL SELECTION IS LIMITED. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT MOST BLACK PATIENTS (86%) HAVE A HIGHER QUALITY HOSPITAL LOCATED WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THEIR HOME AND THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE DISPARITIES BY >30% WITH DATA DRIVEN REFERRALS WHILE IMPROVING OUTCOMES ACROSS POPULATIONS.

THESE DISPARITIES ARE UNIQUE TO SGM, AS WHEN COMPARED TO SIMILARLY VICTIMIZED NON-SGM PEERS, VICTIMIZED SGM ADOLESCENTS REPORT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES OF SUICIDE. WHEN SCHOOLS LACK SGM BULLYING POLICIES, SGM STUDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT SUICIDALITY THAN PEERS IN SCHOOLS WITH PROTECTIVE POLICIES.

THE DASH DIET, A BALANCED EATING PLAN THAT EMPHASIZES FRUITS, VEGETABLES, LOW FAT DAIRY, AND LEAN MEATS, IS EFFICACIOUS IN LOWERING BP AMONG BLACK ADULTS WITH HYPERTENSION. HOWEVER, UPTAKE AMONG BLACK ADULTS IS POOR. IN FACT, UNHEALTHY DIET IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF DISPARITIES IN HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT AMONG BLACK ADULTS. DESPITE NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES ENCOURAGING ADULTS TO EAT 7-9 DAILY SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, AVERAGE CONSUMPTION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY ADULTS OF LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS HAS STAGNATED AT 1.3 SERVINGS DAILY.

TONSILLECTOMIES IN CHILDREN ARE MOST COMMONLY PERFORMED FOR OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP DISORDERED BREATHING (OSDB) OR RECURRENT THROAT INFECTION. THE PROCEDURE IMPROVES OSDB SYMPTOMS, BEHAVIOR, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHILDREN WITH OSDB. IT IS ALSO AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN WITH SEVERE RECURRENT TONSILLITIS. NEVERTHELESS, MANY CHILDREN EXPERIENCE A RESOLUTION OF OSDB OR MILD TONSILLAR INFECTIONS OVER TIME WITHOUT HAVING SURGERY. AS SUCH, TONSILLECTOMY IS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN USE AND LIKELY OVERUSE IN SOME GROUPS. EVIDENCE OF POTENTIAL OVERUSE COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THE RATE OF TONSILLECTOMY FOR RECURRENT THROAT INFECTION IS 2-3 TIMES HIGHER IN RURAL WHITE CHILDREN THAN NON-RURAL WHITE CHILDREN OR EITHER BLACK OR HISPANIC CHILDREN. IN CONTRAST, BLACK AND HISPANIC CHILDREN ARE FAR MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE CHILDREN TO HAVE OSDB, BUT THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO UNDERGO TONSILLECTOMY FOR THIS CONDITION.

RESEARCH IN WHITE POPULATIONS HAS DOCUMENTED HOW SOCIAL SUPPORT PROTECTS AGAINST THE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF STRESS, BUT LITTLE WORK HAS EXAMINED THESE EFFECTS IN HISPANIC SAMPLES.

SOUTH DAKOTA'S PUBLIC SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2013 (HEREAFTER, SB70) REDUCED PRISON SENTENCES, INCREASED ASSIGNMENT TO PROBATION, RE-CLASSIFIED FELONY OFFENSES TO LOWER SEVERITY CLASSES, AND ALLOWED THOSE ON COMMUNITY SUPERVISION TO EARN REDUCTIONS IN TIME ON SUPERVISION. ESSENTIALLY, THOSE ARRESTED POST-SB70 WERE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT PENALTIES AND SUPERVISION RELATIVE TO THOSE ARRESTED PRE-SB70 FOR THE SAME OFFENSES, BASED ONLY ON TIMING. OUR STUDY UTILIZES THIS POLICY EXPERIMENT FOR THE EXOGENOUS VARIATION NEEDED TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE EXPOSURE AND MORTALITY. AN INTRINSIC ASPECT IS TO ASSESS DISPARITIES BY RACE/ETHNICITY AND SEX WITH A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE ON NATIVE AMERICANS. FOR THIS PROJECT, WE HAVE OBTAINED CRIMINAL HISTORY DATA ON ALL 202,594 ARRESTEES (2000-2019) AS WELL AS MATCHED MORTALITY RECORDS.  IN SUMMARY, THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED EVIDENCE ON EXCESS MORTALITY AMONG ARRESTEES SENTENCED TO PRISON, JAIL, COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OR RELEASED OVERALL AND BY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP; ASSESS WHETHER SB70 INFLUENCED THE RISK, TIMING AND CAUSES OF MORTALITY OVERALL AND BY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP; AND FINALLY, ESTIMATE HOW CRIMINAL JUSTICE EXPOSURE INFLUENCED THE RISK, TIMING AND CAUSES OF MORTALITY OVERALL AND BY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP. UNDERSTANDING HOW EXPOSURE TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM INFLUENCES MORTALITY IS PARTICULARLY POLICY-RELEVANT GIVEN THE MASS INCARCERATION IN THE US AND STATES' EFFORTS TO REDUCE ITS IMPACT ON BUDGETS AND SOCIETY. DISPARITIES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE EXPOSURE MIRROR DISPARITIES IN MORTALITY, SUGGESTING THAT THE TWO PHENOMENA MAY BE INTERTWINED. THUS, THIS STUDY IS NOT SIMPLY AN EVALUATION OF SB70, BUT RATHER A QUASI- EXPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE EXPOSURE ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c2e789dd-a647-f435-a418-0a918163d623-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01MD015713_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110024661, "Award ID": "R01MD015409", "Award Amount": 3031810.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-26", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "UNDERSTANDING MECHANISMS UNDERLYING CHRONIC STRESS-INDUCED ASTHMA IN CHILDREN BY POPULATION AND SINGLE-CELL EPIGENOMICS APPROACHES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "43049b95-a970-fc61-495d-0de7d1349319-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01MD015409_7529"}, {"internal_id": 131359728, "Award ID": "R01MD015407", "Award Amount": 1797810.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-04-13", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "THE ROLE OF EPIGENETICS IN THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS ON COPD OUTCOMES - PROJECT SUMMARY CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) IS THE 4TH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES WITH HIGH MORBIDITY, INCLUDING POOR QUALITY OF LIFE AND RESPIRATORY EXACERBATIONS LEADING TO HOSPITALIZATION AND INCREASED MORTALITY.

LATINOS, THE LARGEST AND FASTEST GROWING ETHNIC MINORITY GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE A HIGH PREVALENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY AND SOCIAL STRESSORS IN BOTH CHILDHOOD AND ADULTHOOD COMPARED TO OTHER RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS. ONE NOVEL METHOD TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN STRESSORS AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE IS DNA METHYLATION.

IMPORTANTLY, COVID-19 HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED HEALTH, INCLUDING SLEEP, WITH MINORITY POPULATIONS BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. ADDITIONALLY, INCREASING HATE SPEECH AND RACIST ATTACKS AGAINST ASIANS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, LEADING TO INCREASED MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL TOLL IN THIS POPULATION. FINDINGS FROM THE PRELIMINARY STUDY ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT SLEEP DURATION WAS INVERSELY ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES, AND SLEEP APNEA WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH HYPERTENSION AND OBESITY.  THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS INNOVATIVE LONGITUDINAL STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND: (1) MECHANISMS OF SLEEP DISPARITIES IN RELATION TO IMMIGRANT STRESSORS AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS; AND (2) CONSEQUENCES OF SLEEP DISPARITIES ON HEALTH OUTCOMES, IN A SAMPLE OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING CHINESE, KOREAN, AND VIETNAMESE ADULTS (N=750).

UNFORTUNATELY, THESE EFFORTS TO CHANGE ACTIVITY LEVELS ARE OFTEN NOT SUSTAINED BEYOND THE INITIAL INTERVENTION PERIOD. ONE POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THIS LACK OF SUSTAINABILITY IS THAT INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION WAS PAID TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT FACILITATE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THUS, ATTENTION IS SHIFTING TO MORE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, WITH THE AIM OF IDENTIFYING MULTI-LEVEL STRATEGIES TO BETTER TARGET INTERVENTIONS TO GROUPS THAT NEED HELP. VERY FEW TESTS OF CHANGING ENVIRONMENT LEVELS TO INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EXIST IN THE LITERATURE.

OUR LONG-TERM GOALS ARE (1) TO ASSESS THE VIABILITY OF BPC FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW LEOS PERCEIVE MMY BOTH \u201cIN THE MOMENT\u201d VIA THE PRE-REFLECTIVE PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE USED BEFORE AND DURING LEO-MMY ENCOUNTERS AND \u201cAT REST\u201d VIA DEVELOPMENT OF A SURVEY INSTRUMENT MEASURING LEO IDENTIFICATION WITH MINORITY YOUTH, AND (2) TO DETERMINE IF BPC MAY BE USED IN LIEU OF NON-PUBLIC DATA SOURCES TO STUDY POLICE BEHAVIOR BY DEVELOPING A NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL STRATEGY FOR EXTRACTING MEANINGFUL INFORMATION FROM BPC VIA, AMONG OTHER STRATEGIES, A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION (ASR) MODEL AND LARGE SCALE (>100 HOURS) TRAINING CORPUS OF TRANSCRIBED BPC FOR USE BY COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND ASR RESEARCHERS. OUR PREVIOUS RESEARCH REVEALED THAT A COMPLEX SET OF PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS GOVERN THE DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OF MMYS, INDICATING MMYS ADOPT REACTIVE COPING STRATEGIES TO PARTICULAR STRESSFUL EVENTS (E.G. ENCOUNTERS WITH POLICE) THAT CAN BE MALADAPTIVE (E.G. HYPERMASCULINITY) DEPENDING ON CONTEXT OF INTERACTIONS. OUR WORK ALSO SUGGESTS THAT ALL HUMANS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR PROCESSES. SINCE THE OUTCOMES OF LEO-MMY ENCOUNTERS ARE ULTIMATELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LEOS, THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THESE ENCOUNTERS (I.E. REDUCE YOUTH TRAUMA) BY STUDYING A LITTLE ACKNOWLEDGED LEO REACTIVE COPING STRATEGY: THE CHARACTER OF PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE USED TO PROVIDE LEOS WITH INCIDENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION VIA BPC. THIS CONCEPTUAL APPROACH DERIVES FROM OUR THEORETICAL FRAMING (I.E. SPENCER\u2019S PHENOMENOLOGICAL VARIANT OF ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS THEORY, OR PVEST) THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF REACTIVE COPING STRATEGIES IN RESPONSE\u2014PARTICULARLY\u2014TO MMY ASSOCIATED STRESS. IT IS OUR PREMISE THAT BPC CAN PRIME LEOS TO INACCURATELY INTERPRET THE BEHAVIOR OF MMY AS THREATENING, INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE EVENTS. SUCH INACCURATE ASSESSMENTS ARE HARD TO COMBAT SINCE LEOS ARE ACTING ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT, THE PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE OF BPC POSE UNACKNOWLEDGED RISKS TO THE WELL- BEING OF MMY. THIS STUDY WILL THUS PERFORM A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND ANALYSIS OF BPC TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ASSESS ITS VIABILITY FOR DETERMINING RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN POLICING AND DEVELOP A NOVEL SURVEY INSTRUMENT MEASURING LEOS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY WITH MMY FOR USE BY RESEARCHERS AND POLICING ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d4bd68be-2bd0-4a42-0d20-0ad92720d93c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01MD015064_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140657834, "Award ID": "R01MD015055", "Award Amount": 1966841.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-23", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "THE IMPACT OF POPULATION AND EPISODE-BASED PAYMENT MODELS ON SURGICAL DISPARITIES - PROJECT SUMMARY AS A PROMINENT LEADER IN THE NATIONWIDE SHIFT TOWARDS VALUE-BASED PAYMENT, MEDICARE HAS IMPLEMENTED LARGE FEE-FOR-SERVICE POPULATION- AND EPISODE-BASED ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS (APMS) THAT HOLD ORGANIZATIONS FINANCIALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE QUALITY AND COSTS OF CARE.

GLAUCOMA IS A COMPLEX CHRONIC DISEASE, SPANNING DECADES OF PATIENTS' LIVES AND REQUIRING ONGOING MONITORING AND EVALUATION, THUS MAKING IT AN IDEAL APPLICATION FOR THE USE OF HEALTH IT TO REDUCE RACIAL DISPARITIES. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE AIM TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY: DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A FLEXIBLE ELECTRONIC EYEDROP SENSOR TO GENERATE GRANULAR DIGITAL SIGNATURES OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S ADHERENCE AND CONTEXTUALIZING THIS DATA IN A SOCIO- CULTURAL CONTEXT WITH PATIENT INTERVIEWS (AIM 1), COMBINING ADHERENCE DATA WITH EHR VARIABLES TO CONSTRUCT MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO PREDICT IOP CONTROL AND ENHANCE CLINICAL RISK STRATIFICATION (AIM 2), AND PROTOTYPING A DYNAMIC DASHBOARD FOR INTERVENTION COORDINATION (AIM 3).

WE WILL EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE, INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES, SMOKING AND EPIGENETIC CHANGES IN PROTEIN ARGININE METHYL TRANSFERASES (PRMT6) THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING LUNG CANCER. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT SMOKING INDUCES INCREASED EXPRESSION OF PRMT6 IN THE LUNG EPITHELIUM. WE ALSO SHOWED THAT OVEREXPRESSION OF PRMT6 TRIGGERS SPONTANEOUS LUNG TUMORS IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, WE FOUND THAT PRMT6 IS UPREGULATED AMONG BLACK MEN COMPARED WITH WHITE MEN IN THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS (TCGA). THUS WE ARGUE THAT THE INCREASED OVEREXPRESSION OF PRMT6 AMONG BLACK MEN MAY EXPLAIN A HIGHER RATE OF LUNG CANCER AMONG BLACK MEN COMPARED WITH WHITE MEN. WHILE SMOKING IS A KEY CONTRIBUTING FACTOR FOR LUNG CANCER, THE FREQUENCY AND AMOUNT OF CIGARETTE SMOKING ARE NOT NECESSARILY HIGHER FOR BLACKS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT OTHER FACTORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RACIAL DISPARITY IN LUNG CANCER. DISPROPORTIONATE SOCIAL STRESS IN BLACK COMMUNITIES MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A HIGHER RATE OF LUNG CANCER AMONG BLACKS. IN PARTICULAR, INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN EXCESSIVE NEIGHBORHOOD VIOLENCE ARE EXPOSED TO CHRONIC STRESS, WHICH MAY INTENSIFY THE EPIGENETIC CHANGES FOR LUNG CANCER. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT EXPOSURE TO NEIGHBORHOOD VIOLENCE IS SOCIAL STRESS THAT INCREASES BIOPHYSICAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES, WHICH EXACERBATE THE PATH BETWEEN SMOKING, PRMT6 OVEREXPRESSION, AND LUNG CANCER. TO EXAMINE THE PROPOSED SOCIAL EPIGENETIC MECHANISM OF LUNG CANCER DISPARITY, FIRST, WE WILL TEST THE INDEPENDENT EFFECT OF SMOKING AND EXPOSURE TO NEIGHBORHOOD VIOLENCE, AND THE INTERACTION OF THE TWO RISKS ON PRMT6 EXPRESSION USING RETROSPECTIVE TISSUE SAMPLES FROM BLACK AND WHITE LUNG CANCER CASES (AIM 2). SECOND, WE WILL TEST THE EFFECT OF EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE ON AN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE (HAIR CORTISOL) AND LUNG CANCER SCREENING OUTCOMES BY CONDUCTING A PROSPECTIVE SURVEY AND DATA COLLECTION WITH HIGH-RISK BLACK MEN (AIM 3). FINALLY, WE WILL BUILD A MULTILEVEL, CONTEXT-SPECIFIC LUNG CANCER RISK PROFILES (AIM 1) THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT NOT ONLY INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIORAL RISK (SMOKING), BUT NEIGHBORHOOD STRESS (EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE), PHYSIOLOGICAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES (INCREASED CORTISOL), AND MOLECULAR CHANGES (PRMT6 OVEREXPRESSION). TO DEVELOP SUCH RISK PROFILES, WE UTILIZE A COMPOSITE POPULATION DATA APPROACH TO ESTABLISH ACCURATE COUNTS OF ALL INDIVIDUALS WITHIN CENSUS TRACTS WITH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC, BEHAVIORAL, AND NEIGHBORHOOD RISK PROFILES. THE STRENGTH OF RECODE IS ITS INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO UNVEIL A SOCIAL EPIGENETIC MECHANISM OF LUNG CANCER DISPARITY.

THE PREVALENCE OF STROKE IS HIGHER AMONG AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE (AIAN) POPULATIONS THAN IN ANY OTHER U.S. RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP. CHRONIC PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS INCREASES THE RISK FOR HYPERTENSION, AND IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED STROKE RISK FACTOR IN AIAN POPULATIONS. THE PREVALENCE OF STROKE HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS, AND IS LIKELY BROUGHT ON BY CHRONIC STRESSORS INCLUDING HISTORICAL TRAUMA, CULTURAL CHANGE AND ADVERSE SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH, IN TURN, INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF UNHEALTHY BEHAVIORAL COPING RESPONSES (E.G., SMOKING, REDUCED EXERCISE, POOR SLEEP AND OVEREATING). HOWEVER, OUR PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT BOTH STRONG ADHERENCE TO YUP'IK CULTURAL TRADITIONS (ENCULTURATION) AND DUAL ADHERENCE TO YUP'IK AND WHITE CULTURE (BICULTURALISM) ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHIER BLOOD PRESSURE WHEN COMPARED TO YUP'IK INDIVIDUALS ADHERING TO A MORE WESTERN LIFESTYLE (ACCULTURATION). NO PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED THE MOLECULAR EVENTS UNDERLYING THE BASIS FOR THE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF ENCULTURATION/BICULTURALISM-INDUCED RESILIENCE (EBIR) ON RISK FOR HYPERTENSION, REPRESENTING A CRITICAL BARRIER TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURALLY EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT PROMOTING HEALTH. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH EXAMINES THE ROLE OF EBIR AT EACH STEP OF THE STRESS-DISEASE CASCADE \u2013 A MODEL BASED ON EXTENSIVE RESEARCH LINKING CHRONIC STRESSFUL EVENTS TO BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AND DISEASES SUCH AS HYPERTENSION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT EBIR BLOCKS OR BUFFERS ADVERSE INDIVIDUAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS RESULTING IN REDUCED METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION AND INFLAMMATION, INHIBITION OF EPIGENETIC DYSREGULATION, AND MAINTENANCE OF LEUKOCYTE TELOMERE LENGTH, ALL OR SOME OF WHICH LEAD TO HEALTHY BLOOD PRESSURE. WE TEST THESE HYPOTHESES BY ADDRESSING THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS (SAS): SA1 - CONDUCT LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS USING SELF- REPORTED DATA ABOUT ENCULTURATION, BICULTURALISM, AND CHRONIC STRESS FROM 800 YUP'IK PARTICIPANTS TO FORM CLASSES BASED ON THEIR DEGREE OF EBIR/STRESS (SA1A), FOLLOWED BY EVALUATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EBIR/STRESS LATENT CLASSES AND MALADAPTIVE HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS AS WELL AS BETWEEN BLOOD PRESSURE, THE MAIN STUDY OUTCOME MEASURE (SA1B); SA2 - EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EBIR/STRESS LATENT CLASSES WITH METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION (SALIVARY CORTISOL, FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE AND HBA1C LEVELS, AND LIPID LEVELS), MITOCHONDRIAL ALLOSTATIC LOAD, AND CHRONIC LOW-GRADE INFLAMMATION; AND SA3 - DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF EBIR/STRESS LATENT CLASSES ON EPIGENOME- WIDE DNA METHYLATION AND DOWNSTREAM CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION (SA3A) AS WELL AS QUANTIFY THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN METHYLATION SITES AND BLOOD PRESSURE (SA3B), AND TEST WHETHER DIFFERENTIAL METHYLATION MEDIATES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EBIR/STRESS LATENT CLASSES AND BLOOD PRESSURE (SA3C).

THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ALTERED HEALTHCARE DELIVERY IN WAYS THAT HAVE LIMITED THESE SUPPORTIVE OBSTETRICS AND PEDIATRIC SERVICES PROVIDED AT THE BEGINNING OF NEW PARENTHOOD. CONSEQUENTLY, ASPECTS OF PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE, SUCH AS MONITORING FOR SYMPTOMS OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, DISCUSSING OPTIMAL BIRTH CONTROL OPTIONS, EDUCATING PARENTS ON RECOMMENDED ADULT AND PEDIATRIC VACCINATIONS, AND PROVIDING ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE ON INFANT WELLNESS, ARE LESS ROBUST. IN ADDITION, WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT, OUTCOMES OF FOUNDATIONAL IMPORTANCE TO NEW PARENTS, SUCH AS PERCEIVED STRESS, DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, OR PARENTING AND BREAST-FEEDING SELF-EFFICACY, ARE WORSE.

ADDITIONALLY, THE SURVIVAL RATE FOR TNBC IS LOWER IN BLACK/AFRICAN WOMEN. TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES ASSOCIATED WITH TNBC WE NEED BROADLY APPLICABLE TARGETED THERAPIES. WITHOUT TARGETED THERAPIES, CLINICIANS ARE LEFT WITH CHEMOTHERAPY, WHICH HAS MANY NEGATIVE SIDE- EFFECTS AND IN MANY CASES IS ULTIMATELY INEFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF TNBC. WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT A SUBSET OF TNBC CELL LINES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXPRESSION OF ADENOSINE DEAMINASE ACTING ON RNA (ADAR). ADAR IS AN ENZYME THAT CONVERTS ADENOSINE NUCLEOTIDES IN RNA TO INOSINE IN A PROCESS KNOWN AS A-TO-I EDITING. LOSS OF ADAR INHIBITS CELLULAR PROLIFERATION AND TUMOR FORMATION FOR A SUBSET OF TNBC CELL LINES. BECAUSE ADAR IS REQUIRED FOR THE GROWTH OF SOME TNBC CELL LINES IT SERVES AS A VALUABLE THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF TNBC. IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT ADAR-DEPENDENT CELL LINES HAVE ELEVATED INTERFERON SIGNALING, POTENTIALLY MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CLASSIFY ADAR-DEPENDENT TUMORS. INTERFERON SIGNALING IS HIGHER IN BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN BREAST TUMORS THAN TUMORS IN WHITE PATIENTS, WHICH MAY MAKE THERAPIES TARGETING ADAR MORE EFFECTIVE FOR BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN PATIENTS. THERE ARE ASPECTS OF ADAR-DEPENDENCE THAT WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND. FOR INSTANCE, WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY SOME CELLS ARE DEPENDENT ON ADAR EXPRESSION WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT. HERE WE WILL EXPLORE THE MECHANISM OF ADAR-DEPENDENCY AND DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR TREATMENT OF TNBC BASED ON ADAR INHIBITION. IN AIM 1 WE WILL IDENTIFY THE FACTORS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR ADAR-DEPENDENCE, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF THE IMMUNOGENIC RNAS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PHENOTYPE CAUSED BY ADAR DEPLETION. IN AIM 2 WE WILL DEVELOP AND ASSESS A CLASSIFICATION MODEL TO PREDICT WHICH TUMORS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO ADAR INHIBITION. THE ACCURACY OF THE CLASSIFICATION MODEL WILL BE EVALUATED BY KNOCKDOWN OF ADAR IN PATIENT DERIVED XENOGRAFT MODELS OF TNBC.

THIS PROJECT INCLUDES FOUR STUDIES; DURING THE K99 PHASE WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING AIMS: 1) TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF MEDICAID EXPANSION UNDER THE ACA ON ACCESS TO AND UTILIZATION OF ORAL HEALTH SERVICES; AND 2) TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF MEDICAID EXPANSION ON INDIVIDUALS' ORAL HEALTH- RELATED BEHAVIORS AND RACE/ETHNIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES IN UNTREATED DENTAL DISEASE. WE WILL THEN ADDRESS THE R00 PHASE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING AIMS: 3) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND DENTAL PROVIDERS' PERCEPTIONS OF, ATTITUDES TOWARD, AND EXPERIENCES WITH MEDICAID EXPANSION AND TO EXPLORE ACA IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES; AND 4) TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO AND FACILITATORS OF ACCESSING ORAL HEALTH CARE AFTER ACA EXPANSION AMONG MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES. BY TRIANGULATING THE VIEWS FROM BOTH MEDICAID PROVIDERS AND BENEFICIARIES, WE BELIEVE OUR APPROACH WILL PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO ACA IMPLEMENTATION. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY WILL ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH CARE THAT COULD INFORM FUTURE POLICIES AND INTERVENTIONS. FURTHERMORE, IT WILL AID IN ASSESSING NATIONAL PROGRESS TOWARDS REDUCING SOCIOECONOMIC AND RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND EXPLORE MECHANISMS BY WHICH HEALTH POLICY COULD IMPACT DISPARITIES IN ORAL HEALTH. THIS CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD WILL PROVIDE ME WITH PROTECTED RESEARCH TIME AND THUS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND MY RESEARCH SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE. I WILL PURSUE FURTHER TRAINING IN HEALTH POLICY, ECONOMETRICS AND MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH THROUGH DIDACTIC COURSES AND FORMAL ADVISING FROM MY MENTORS, WHO ARE EXPERTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH, HEALTH POLICY, HEALTH ECONOMICS, HEALTH DISPARITIES, AND QUALITATIVE METHODS. THE SETTING OF THIS AWARD IS AT HARVARD SCHOOL OF DENTAL MEDICINE AND HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

THESE CHRONIC CONDITIONS ARE A PRIMARY CAUSE OF POOR HEALTH, REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PREMATURE DEATH, AND ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 50% OF HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES. DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION OF SOME CHRONIC DISEASES AND RISK FACTORS OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, THE SOUTHEAST CONTINUES TO HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY PREVENTABLE DEATHS FOR EACH OF THE FIVE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH.  RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES COMPRISE 39% OF THE POPULATION OF THE SOUTHEAST (HHS REGION IV), WHICH INCLUDES NEARLY 15 MILLION AFRICAN AMERICANS AND 9 MILLION LATINOS. MINORITIES IN THE SOUTHEAST FARE WORSE ON MANY HEALTH INDICATORS COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS, IN LARGE PART DUE TO POOR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, WITH MORE THAN 22% OF SOUTHEASTERN RESIDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY.

PROJECT SUMMARY \u2013 TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH IN 2019, THE US ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO END THE HIV EPIDEMIC BY 2030. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, STRATEGIES THAT IMPROVE HIV PREVENTION AND HIV TREATMENT OUTCOMES ARE NEEDED. ONLY 56% OF PEOPLE WITH HIV (PWH) WERE VIRALLY SUPPRESSED IN 2018, A CRITICAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH OUTCOMES AND TRANSMISSION RISK, AND 51% OF HIV DIAGNOSES IN 2018 WERE IN THE US SOUTH, DESPITE CONSTITUTING ONLY 38% OF THE POPULATION IN THE US. TEXAS IS THE SECOND MOST POPULOUS STATE IN THE US, BEHIND CALIFORNIA, WITH ABOUT 29 MILLION RESIDENTS, AND IS IN THE US SOUTH AS DEFINED BY CDC AND THE CENSUS BUREAU. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS LARGE TEXAS POPULATION, COUPLED WITH WEAKER PUBLIC HEALTH AND PREVENTION POLICIES AND FUNDING ACROSS THE US SOUTH, HAS A GROWING HIV POPULATION THAT LAGS IN CRITICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH AND RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE TO COMBAT THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE US SOUTH AND SPECIFICALLY IN TEXAS TO BOTH CONTRIBUTE TO ENDING THE US HIV EPIDEMIC AND TO LEARN HOW TO BEST DO THAT IN RESOURCE CONSTRAINED AREAS OF THE US. WE THEREFORE WILL ESTABLISH A TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH (D-CFAR) TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL MISSION OF THE NATIONAL CFAR PROGRAM BY FACILITATING HIGH-PRIORITY HIV RESEARCH AND SUPPORTING THE EFFORT TO END THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE US. THREE INSTITUTIONS HAVE COLLABORATED TO PROPOSE THIS D-CFAR: BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN HOUSTON, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER AT HOUSTON AND THE TEXAS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN SAN ANTONIO. BASED UPON THE OUTSTANDING EXPERTISE OF ITS INVESTIGATORS, THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL FOCUS ITS ACTIVITIES IN THE FIVE-YEAR FUNDING PERIOD ON THE RESEARCH THEME \u201cENDING HIV AND OPTIMIZING HIV HEALTH IN TEXAS.\u201d TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GOALS, THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL: 1) PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND FACILITATE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS THAT STRENGTHEN AND ENRICH THE D-CFAR RESEARCH AND INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT; 2) SUPPORT TARGETED HIGH-PRIORITY INTERDISCIPLINARY PILOT RESEARCH PROJECTS, ASSIST IN RESPONDING TO NEW HIV-RELATED RESEARCH INITIATIVES, AND FACILITATE RESEARCH ON ENDING HIV AND IMPROVING HEALTH OF PWH IN TEXAS; AND 3) PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART EXPERTISE, ADVICE, AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE THE RANGE OF HIV-RELATED RESEARCH FOR D-CFAR INVESTIGATORS. THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL SUPPORT AN ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, A DEVELOPMENTAL CORE, A BASIC SCIENCE CORE AND A CLINICAL AND BIOSTATISTICS CORE TO MEET INVESTIGATOR NEEDS AND CATALYZE INNOVATIVE RESEARCH. THE SCIENTIFIC CORES WILL BUILD ON OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS IN VIROLOGY, NON-HUMAN PRIMATE RESOURCES, CLINICAL TRIALS RESEARCH AND BIOSTATISTICS. THE D-CFAR WILL ENGAGE A COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ADVISORY BOARDS FOR GUIDANCE. COUPLED WITH OUTSTANDING INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, THE D- CFAR WILL STIMULATE NEW RESEARCH AND COLLABORATIONS AMONG BASIC, TRANSLATIONAL, CLINICAL, HEALTH SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS. THE D-CFAR WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO END HIV AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF PWH IN TEXAS AND SIMILAR AREAS, TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS, AND GROW INTO A FULL CFAR, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO ENDING THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN TEXAS, THE US SOUTH, AND BEYOND.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ddcd398f-5e59-e840-2368-a57b84efdc7d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_P30AI161943_7529"}, {"internal_id": 147873522, "Award ID": "P30AI152501", "Award Amount": 6215137.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-08", "CFDA Number": "93.855", "Description": "UCLA-CDU CFAR - OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: THIS APPLICATION IS A RESUBMISSION FOR A NEW CFAR THAT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN UCLA AND CDU. OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO CREATE A NIMBLE MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROMOTES EQUITY AND WILL CONNECT AND SUPPORT INVESTIGATORS AFFILIATED WITH BOTH INSTITUTIONS TO ADVANCE CRITICAL HIV SCIENCE. THE UCLA-CDU CFAR WILL STRENGTHEN AND AMPLIFY THE IMPACT OF EXISTING RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND LAUNCH NEW PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS LOS ANGELES AND GLOBALLY THROUGH OUR FOCUS ON THREE THEMES: WE WILL STOP HIV BY PREVENTING NEW HIV INFECTIONS (PREVENTION), REDUCING MORBIDITY AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (TREATMENT) AND DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR ERADICATION (ART-FREE REMISSION). THIS GRANT WILL FUND AIDS-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY INVESTIGATORS AT UCLA, CDU AND OUR AFFILIATED INSTITUTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER IN TORRANCE; THE UCLA CARE CLINIC AND THE VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN WESTWOOD; THE UCLA VINE STREET CLINIC IN WEST HOLLYWOOD; AND THE DREW CARES, THE CDU PUSH COALITION AND THE MLK OASIS CLINIC AT CDU. THESE FACILITIES ARE AT GROUND ZERO FOR THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PERSONS LIVING WITH HIV RESIDING IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS DIRECTLY SERVED BY OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS. IN ADDITION TO THE FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS BASED IN LOS ANGELES, RESEARCHERS AT UCLA AND CDU HAVE EXTENSIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH HIV PROGRAMS AROUND THE GLOBE THAT ARE AIMED AT BUILDING GLOBAL CAPACITY. THE CFAR WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER RESEARCH AT THE INTERFACE OF COMMUNITY BY REACHING COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED AND BY BRINGING TO BEAR THE TALENT OF CDU AND UCLA RESEARCHERS TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS FROM A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE WHILE MENTORING THE NEXT GENERATION WHO BETTER REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES BEING SERVED. THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE UCLA-CDU CFAR WILL ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AIDS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES BY HARNESSING THE DIVERSE EXPERTISE IN OUR CFAR, AND BY INCLUDING LINKAGES TO COMMUNITY- BASED CLINICIAN INVESTIGATORS AND COMMUNITIES. THE ACTION PLAN FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF REQUESTED SUPPORT INCLUDES 6 CORES AND 1 SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP (SWG): THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, DEVELOPMENTAL CORE, CENTRALIZED LABORATORY SUPPORT CORE, HUMANIZED MOUSE AND GENE THERAPY CORE, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND CLINICAL INFORMATICS CORE, CLINICAL SCIENCE CORE, AND A TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN SUBSTANCE USE SWG. RELEVANCE: RESEARCH INTO THE PATHOGENESIS, TREATMENT AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF HIV DISEASE IS REQUIRED TO END THE EPIDEMIC. THE UCLA-CDU CFAR SEEKS TO CATALYZE AND EXPAND HIV RESEARCH BY PROVIDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONNECT, SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF INVESTIGATORS AFFILIATED WITH UCLA AND CDU.

AMERICAN PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS ARE KNOWN TO BE DIAGNOSED AT AN EARLIER AGE, PRESENT WITH AGGRESSIVE DISEASE, AND ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO SUCCUMB TO PROSTATE CANCER THAN OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. DESPITE A MAJOR FOCUS ON SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS, RECENT FINDINGS STRONGLY ARGUE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF BIOLOGICAL FACTORS DRIVING CANCER DISPARITIES. IN MY EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND BIOLOGICAL DRIVERS IN PROSTATE CANCER, I APPLIED A NOVEL DNA DAMAGE DETECTION METHOD, REPAIR ASSISTED DAMAGE DETECTION (RADD), AND ESTABLISHED THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN TUMORS HAVE MORE DNA LESIONS OVERALL THAN EA TUMORS, ESPECIALLY URACIL LESIONS. OUR LAB HAS PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE HOMOCYSTEINE-METHIONINE PATHWAY IS A METABOLIC HALLMARK OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PROSTATE CANCERS, WHICH FUELS THE PROGRESSION OF THE FOLATE CYCLE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE CONVERSION OF DEOXYURIDINE MONOPHOSPHATE (DUMP) TO DEOXYTHYMIDINE MONOPHOSPHATE (DTMP). AN UPREGULATION OF METABOLITES IN THE DE NOVO PYRIMIDINE BIOSYNTHESIS PATHWAY AND ALTERED LEVELS OF FOLATE CYCLE METABOLITES WERE IDENTIFIED IN AFRICAN AMERICAN PROSTATE TUMORS, SUGGESTING THE LINK BETWEEN URACIL METABOLISM AND URACIL LESION ACCUMULATION. URACIL LESIONS ARE REPAIRED BY THE BASE EXCISION REPAIR PATHWAY. WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT EXPRESSION OF XRCC1, A PROTEIN INVOLVED IN COORDINATING BASE EXCISION REPAIR FUNCTION, WAS LOWER IN AFRICAN AMERICAN PROSTATE TUMORS, INDICATIVE OF DEFECTIVE BASE EXCISION REPAIR. THESE DATA COLLECTIVELY SUGGEST THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN TUMORS EXHIBIT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THYMIDYLATE STRESS, WHERE THE ABILITY OF THYMIDYLATE SYNTHASE (TYMS) TO CONVERT DUMP TO DTMP IS OBSTRUCTED, RESULTING IN DYSREGULATION OF BASE EXCISION THROUGH THE RETENTION OF URACIL LESIONS. THE INCREASED AMOUNTS OF URACIL LESIONS IN AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN COULD BE A CUMULATIVE RESULT OF CHANGES IN NUCLEOTIDE METABOLISM, WHICH IS CAUSED BY ALTERED LEVELS OF COMPONENTS IN THE FOLATE CYCLE AND ONE-CARBON METABOLISM. THESE COMPONENTS, SUCH VITAMIN B12 AND FOLATE, ARE KNOWN TO BE REDUCED IN AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN, WHICH COULD RESULT FROM EITHER DIETARY DEFICIENCIES OR DUE TO AN ABERRANT HOMOCYSTEINE-METHIONINE CYCLE, OR BOTH. WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR CONSEQUENCES OF REDUCED FOLATE AS IT RELATES TO URACIL ACCUMULATION, THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE THROUGH THE REGULATION OF VITAMIN B12 AND FOLATE IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. THE HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT ALTERED LEVELS OF VITAMIN B12 AND FOLATE CONTRIBUTE TO THYMIDYLATE STRESS, RESULTING IN BASE EXCISION REPAIR PATHWAY DYSFUNCTION AND PROMOTING PROSTATE CANCER PROGRESSION IN AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL 1) DETERMINE THE CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF HOMOCYSTEINE, VITAMIN B12, AND FOLATE WITH PROSTATE CANCER PROGRESSION IN AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN AND 2) ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF HOMOCYSTEINE, VITAMIN B12, AND FOLATE REGULATION ON TYMS FUNCTION AND BASE EXCISION REPAIR IN AFRICAN AMERICAN PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL ESTABLISH A LINK BETWEEN METABOLISM AND DNA REPAIR IN AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN WITH PROSTATE CANCER AND HELP DEVELOP METABOLIC BIOMARKERS TO STRATIFY THESE PATIENTS FOR DNA REPAIR INHIBITOR THERAPIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ddcd398f-5e59-e840-2368-a57b84efdc7d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K99MD018671_7529"}, {"internal_id": 161643051, "Award ID": "K99MD018629", "Award Amount": 131908.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-08-02", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "RACISM-RELATED STRESS AND BIRTH OUTCOMES AMONG LATINAS: NEW TOOLS FOR MAXIMIZING CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL VALIDITY - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT DESPITE THE WELL-KNOWN LATINA BIRTH PARADOX, RECENT DATA (2020) SHOW THAT LATINA MOTHERS ARE 1.2-1.5 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS COMPARED TO WHITE MOTHERS. ADDITIONALLY, COMPARED TO WHITE WOMEN, ANNUAL NATIONAL VITAL STATISTICS DATA FROM 1989 THROUGH 2020 SHOW CONSISTENTLY HIGHER RATES OF WORSE BIRTH OUTCOMES AMONG LATINAS. THE LONGSTANDING FOCUS ON THE LATINA BIRTH PARADOX HAS LEFT A GAP IN THE LITERATURE, RESULTING IN A CRITICAL NEED FOR RESEARCH ON BIRTH OUTCOME DISPARITIES FACED BY LATINAS, AND THE MECHANISMS DRIVING THOSE DISPARITIES. WE PROPOSE TWO NOVEL MECHANISMS AS CONTRIBUTORS TO POOR BIRTH OUTCOMES FOR LATINAS: ANTICIPATORY RACISM THREAT AND AREA-LEVEL RACIAL BIAS. A STRONG BODY OF EVIDENCE HAS DEMONSTRATED LINKS BETWEEN CHRONIC SOCIAL STRESS AND POOR BIRTH OUTCOMES. RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, A CHRONIC PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESSOR, IS A PROMINENT EXPLANATION FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN BIRTH OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS LIMITED BY THE PREDOMINANT FOCUS ON RACISM EVENTS AND RACISM EXPERIENCES AT THE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL. WE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A MEASURE OF ANTICIPATORY RACISM THREAT (ART) FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AND FOUND ASSOCIATIONS WITH HYPERTENSION, ALLOSTATIC LOAD AND TELOMERE LENGTH. THESE PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT ANTICIPATING RACISM, ABOVE AND BEYOND ACTUAL RACISM EVENTS, IS RELATED TO BIOLOGICAL DYSREGULATION, INCLUDING DYSREGULATION OF SYSTEMS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN LINKED WITH LOW BIRTHWEIGHT AND PRETERM BIRTH. ANOTHER NEGLECTED COMPONENT OF RACISM-RELATED STRESS IS AREA-LEVEL RACIAL BIAS. EMERGING EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES SIGNIFICANT LINKS BETWEEN NEGATIVE AREA-LEVEL RACIAL SENTIMENT AND BIRTH OUTCOMES FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES GROUPS. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE K99 PHASE ARE TO 1) CREATE AND PSYCHOMETRICALLY VALIDATE AN ART-LATINA SCALE AND 2) EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS WITH LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND PRETERM BIRTH IN RECENT LATINA MOTHERS. R00 PHASE OBJECTIVES INCLUDE DEVELOPING AND TESTING ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN A NOVEL COUNTY-LEVEL INDICATOR OF AREA-LEVEL RACIAL BIAS TOWARDS LATINES AND COUNTY-LEVEL BIRTH OUTCOMES AMONG LATINAS. THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS RE-FOCUSING ATTENTION ON POOR BIRTH OUTCOMES AMONG LATINAS, A LONG-STANDING DISPARITY BUT LARGELY NEGLECTED AREA OF INVESTIGATION; HELPING TO ELUCIDATE SOME OF THE PREDICTORS AND UNDERLYING MECHANISMS DRIVING THOSE DISPARITIES; AND ULTIMATELY INFORMING THE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS LIKELY TO AMELIORATE THOSE DISPARITIES. THESE DATA WILL ALSO PROVIDE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR A SUBSEQUENT R01 APPLICATION.

WITHOUT TARGETED THERAPIES, CLINICIANS ARE LEFT WITH CHEMOTHERAPY, WHICH HAS MANY NEGATIVE SIDE- EFFECTS AND IN MANY CASES IS ULTIMATELY INEFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF TNBC. WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT A SUBSET OF TNBC CELL LINES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXPRESSION OF ADENOSINE DEAMINASE ACTING ON RNA (ADAR). ADAR IS AN ENZYME THAT CONVERTS ADENOSINE NUCLEOTIDES IN RNA TO INOSINE IN A PROCESS KNOWN AS A-TO-I EDITING. LOSS OF ADAR INHIBITS CELLULAR PROLIFERATION AND TUMOR FORMATION FOR A SUBSET OF TNBC CELL LINES. BECAUSE ADAR IS REQUIRED FOR THE GROWTH OF SOME TNBC CELL LINES IT SERVES AS A VALUABLE THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF TNBC. IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT ADAR-DEPENDENT CELL LINES HAVE ELEVATED INTERFERON SIGNALING, POTENTIALLY MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CLASSIFY ADAR-DEPENDENT TUMORS. INTERFERON SIGNALING IS HIGHER IN BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN BREAST TUMORS THAN TUMORS IN WHITE PATIENTS, WHICH MAY MAKE THERAPIES TARGETING ADAR MORE EFFECTIVE FOR BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN PATIENTS. THERE ARE ASPECTS OF ADAR-DEPENDENCE THAT WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND. FOR INSTANCE, WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY SOME CELLS ARE DEPENDENT ON ADAR EXPRESSION WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT. HERE WE WILL EXPLORE THE MECHANISM OF ADAR-DEPENDENCY AND DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR TREATMENT OF TNBC BASED ON ADAR INHIBITION.

HER LONG-TERM GOAL IS LEADING A MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAMS TO DEVELOP PATIENT-CENTERED TREATMENT PATHWAYS AND INTERVENTIONS THAT IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND MITIGATE DISPARITIES IN EOSINOPHILIC MUCIN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. RESEARCH: CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS IS A DEBILITATING DISEASE OF THE PARANASAL SINUSES THAT AFFECTS UP TO 16% OF THE UNITED STATES (US) POPULATION, CAUSING INTRACTABLE CONGESTION, SMELL LOSS, AND PERSISTENT HEADACHES THAT CAN LEAD TO PERMEANT AND LIFE-THREATENING MORBIDITIES. RESEARCH IN DIVERSE POPULATIONS DEMONSTRATES THAT HISPANIC AND BLACK PATIENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SEVERE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS DISEASE SUBTYPES SUCH AS EOSINOPHILIC MUCIN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (EMRS), A SUBTYPE COMMON IN THE SOUTHERN US. HISPANIC AND BLACK EMRS PATIENTS PRESENT WITH MORE ADVANCED DISEASE, HAVE WORSE POST-TREATMENT OUTCOMES, AND HAVE HIGH RATES OF MORBIDITY INCLUDING FACIAL BONE DEFORMITIES AND VISION CHANGES. THE ETIOLOGY BEHIND THE DISPARITIES IN EMRS PRESENTATION AND OUTCOMES ARE UNKNOWN. FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE DISEASE BURDEN CANNOT BE ANSWERED UNTIL WE UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE EMRS TREATMENT OUTCOMES.

DKD IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF END STAGE RENAL DISEASE (ESRD), AND ESRD IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE COMPLICATION OF DIABETES. AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS ARE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAVE DKD AND ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO PROGRESS TO ESRD. INNER-CITY POPULATIONS, MADE UP OF PREDOMINANTLY AFRICAN AMERICANS, ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DKD. CHALLENGES OF LIVING IN THE INNER-CITY INCLUDE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ADVERSITY, DEFINED AS HAVING THREE OR MORE SOCIAL ADVERSITIES SUCH AS LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING INSTABILITY, FOOD INSECURITY, TRANSPORTATION NEEDS, UTILITY NEEDS, INTERPERSONAL SAFETY, AND FINANCIAL STRAIN. AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS LIVING IN THE INNER-CITY DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPERIENCE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ADVERSITY, WHICH IMPACTS THE COMPLEX SELF-MANAGEMENT OF DKD SUCH AS SELF-MONITORING AND BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION. THE COMPOUNDED RISKS OF BEING AFRICAN AMERICAN, LIVING IN THE INNER-CITY, HAVING T2DM AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL ADVERSITY LIKELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACCELERATED RATE OF CKD PROGRESSION AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS AND POTENTIATE EXISTING HEALTH DISPARITIES. PATIENT EDUCATION AND SELF-MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORS IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES AND REPRESENT THE CORNERSTONE OF DKD MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION STUDIES IN AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS WITH T2DM INCORPORATING CULTURAL TAILORING, PEER-SUPPORT/COACHING, AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN IMPROVING SHORT-TERM CLINICAL OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, THEIR BENEFITS ARE NOT SUSTAINED LONG-TERM, AND THEY DO NOT PRODUCE LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIOR CHANGES. FURTHER, MAJORITY OF EXISTING STUDIES DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES OF INNER-CITY AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS WHICH LIMITS EFFECTIVENESS OF PATIENT EDUCATION AND SELF-MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORS IN AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS LIVING IN THE INNER-CITY LONG-TERM. SIMILARLY, STUDIES IN AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS WITH T2DM AND CKD THAT INCORPORATE THE CHALLENGES OF LIVING WITH MULTIDIMENSIONAL ADVERSITY ARE SCARCE, DESPITE GROWING EVIDENCE WHICH RECOGNIZES THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL ADVERSITY ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN THIS POPULATION.

ONCE DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES, LATINOS EXPERIENCE WORSE GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND DIABETES-RELATED COMPLICATIONS COMPARED TO NON-LATINO PATIENTS. THESE INEQUITIES ARE DRIVEN BY MULTIPLE INTERRELATED BIOLOGICAL, CULTURAL, AND SOCIAL FACTORS. IN PARTICULAR, A LACK OF ACCESS TO CONSISTENT CARE AND DIFFICULTY NAVIGATING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ARE CRITICAL DRIVERS OF THESE DISPARITIES. BY EXTENDING CARE BEYOND THE CLINIC, TELEMEDICINE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. TELEMEDICINE OFFERS PATIENTS VIDEO AND TELEPHONE VISITS FROM REMOTE SETTINGS. HOWEVER, CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES HAVE CREATED SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN TELEMEDICINE ACCESS AND USE AMONG LATINOS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT (LEP). THE GOAL OF THIS K23 IS TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL NEED BY EVALUATING HOW A CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY TAILORED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY CAN INCREASE TELEMEDICINE USE BY LATINO PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. MY CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT BY APPLYING A HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN APPROACH SUPPORTED BY IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, WE CAN IMPROVE TELEMEDICINE USE, AN IMPORTANT PART OF ADDRESSING DIABETES DISPARITIES.

RACISM- RELATED TRAUMA REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN THAT IS UBIQUITOUS IN THE LIVES OF BLACK YOUTH. YET, THERE IS A LACK OF RESEARCH THAT HAS DISENTANGLED THE UNIQUE EFFECTS OF RACISM-RELATED TRAUMA RELATIVE TO OTHER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. MOREOVER, A GAP REMAINS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF CULTURALLY RELEVANT CONSTRUCTS THAT MAY UNDERLIE THE LINK BETWEEN RACISM-RELATED TRAUMA AND NEGATIVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND MAY SERVE AS MALLEABLE TARGETS FOR INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE RESILIENCY IN THE AFTERMATH OF RACISM-RELATED EVENTS.

PEOPLE WITH LEP ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF ADVERSE EVENTS DURING MEDICAL CARE. IN FACT, 1 IN 12 PATIENTS IS AT RISK FOR ADVERSE EVENTS BECAUSE OF BARRIERS CREATED BY LANGUAGE DISCORDANCE, WHICH OCCURS WHEN THE PATIENT AND PROVIDER DO NOT SHARE A COMMON SPOKEN LANGUAGE. SURGICAL DISPARITIES HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES, BUT VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE IMPACT OF LANGUAGE. UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT THAT LANGUAGE AND LANGUAGE DISCORDANCE OR CONCORDANCE HAVE ON SURGICAL OUTCOMES REPRESENTS A VITAL COMPONENT OF PROVIDING EFFECTIVE, HIGH-QUALITY PATIENT CARE. OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR SURGICAL PATIENTS WITH LEP. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT SOCIOECONOMIC AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS IMPACT OUTCOMES OF SURGICAL CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH LEP AND THAT IDENTIFYING THOSE FACTORS THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ROOTED IN A SOCIAL ECOLOGICAL MODEL (SEM) WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DESIGN INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS THESE RISK FACTORS AND REDUCE SURGICAL DISPARITIES. BUILDING ON A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF PATIENT EXPERIENCES AND SOCIAL RISK FACTORS, THIS PROJECT WILL TEST THE USE OF A MOBILE TECHNOLOGY FOR LIVE MEDICAL INTERPRETATION PROVIDED DIRECTLY TO PATIENTS. WE SEEK TO DETERMINE IF SUCH A SOLUTION CAN IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND PROMOTE PATIENT-INITIATED LANGUAGE CONCORDANT ENCOUNTERS, THEREBY LEADING TO BETTER SURGICAL OUTCOMES. WHILE SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THE EFFECTS OF LANGUAGE DISCORDANCE MAY BE MITIGATED BY THE USE OF TRAINED INTERPRETERS, QUALIFIED INTERPRETERS ARE NOT RELIABLY USED FOR ALL PATIENTS WITH LEP, EVEN AT RESOURCE-RICH HEALTH CENTERS. THESE BARRIERS THREATEN TO COMPROMISE THE PROVISION OF EQUITABLE AND PATIENT-CENTERED CARE FOR THIS PATIENT POPULATION. TO THAT EXTENT, WE WILL TEST OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS BY PURSING THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) DETERMINE WHETHER LANGUAGE CONCORDANCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH SURGICAL OUTCOMES IN A LARGE RETROSPECTIVE SURGICAL PATIENT COHORT; (2) IDENTIFY THE SOCIAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE USE OF FORMAL INTERPRETER SERVICES TO TREAT PRIMARY SPANISH-SPEAKING SURGICAL PATIENTS WITH LEP; AND (3) EVALUATE IF AN IMMEDIATE INTERPRETER MOBILE APPLICATION ENABLES LANGUAGE CONCORDANT COMMUNICATION FOR PRIMARY SPANISH-SPEAKING PATIENTS WITH LEP. LIKEWISE, STUDYING THE COMPLEX INTERACTION OF STRUCTURAL, INTERPERSONAL, AND INDIVIDUAL FACTORS WILL ENRICH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF LANGUAGE ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF SURGICAL CARE.

BLACK PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES REPORT POORER QUALITY END-OF-LIFE CARE, ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE INEFFECTIVE AND BURDENSOME CARE AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO ENROLL IN HOSPICE AT END OF LIFE. EFFECTIVE PATIENT-DOCTOR COMMUNICATION IS CRUCIAL FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF END-OF-LIFE CARE. PHYSICIANS, WHO ARE MAINLY WHITE AND ASIAN IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE LESS LIKELY TO DISCUSS END-OF-LIFE CARE AND DISPLAY POORER COMMUNICATION STYLES WITH BLACK PATIENTS.

OLDER MINORITIES BEAR A SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN OF MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS (MCC) AND RECEIVE POORER QUALITY OF CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT. PATIENT-CLINICIAN COMMUNICATION BARRIERS ARE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO DISPARITIES IN CARE AND OUTCOMES OF MCC. IN PARTICULAR, CLINICAL VISIT COMMUNICATION ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF PEOPLE\u2019S LIVES (I.E., CONTEXTUAL FACTORS SUCH AS MEDICATION USE, DIETARY HABITS, FALL RISK AND SOCIAL SUPPORT) OPTIMALLY INFORMS MCC MANAGEMENT AND IS VITAL TO DELIVERING PATIENT-CENTERED CARE. YET, FEW PATIENT-CLINICIAN COMMUNICATION INTERVENTIONS HAVE INCLUDED DIVERSE OLDER ADULTS WITH MCC, AND MOST DO NOT ADDRESS THE INTERACTIONS OF AGING, MCC AND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT ENHANCE OR REDUCE HEALTH. A COMMON SCENARIO IS THE MINORITY OLDER ADULT WITH DIABETES AND CONCURRENT COMORBID CONDITIONS. THE BURDEN OF SELF-MANAGEMENT TASKS RELATED TO DIABETES (E.G., CHECKING GLUCOSE, TAKING MEDICATIONS, ADHERING TO DIET) WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY FOLLOWING CARE PLANS FOR OTHER CONDITIONS CAN BE OVERWHELMING, PARTICULARLY WHEN CARE PLANS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CONTEXT OF PATIENTS\u2019 DAILY LIVED EXPERIENCES. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO OVERCOME DISPARITIES IN PATIENT-CLINICIAN COMMUNICATION AMONG OLDER MINORITIES WITH MCC BY DEVELOPING A PATIENT-CENTERED TECHNOLOGY-BASED COMMUNICATION INTERVENTION CALLED PHOTO+CARE. THE PREMISE OF PHOTO+CARE IS THAT A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS, MEANING THAT PHOTOS CAN PROMOTE EFFICIENT INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND ACTIVATE PATIENTS TO COMMUNICATE THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCES TO THEIR CLINICIANS, SO THEY CAN DEVELOP PATIENT-CENTERED CARE PLANS TOGETHER. USING SMARTPHONE CAMERAS AS A TOOL, PHOTO+CARE WILL ELICIT AND INTEGRATE 4 CONTEXTUAL FACTORS (MEDICATION USE, DIETARY HABITS, FALL RISK AND SOCIAL SUPPORT) INTO PRIMARY CARE FOR OLDER MINORITY ADULTS WITH MCC. PHOTO+CARE WILL CONSIST OF A PATIENT COMPONENT, COMPRISING: 1) BRIEF TRAINING ON HOW TO TAKE PHOTOS USING A SMARTPHONE; AND 2) STANDARDIZED, STRUCTURED AND OPEN-ENDED PROMPTS TO GUIDE WHAT KIND OF PHOTOS TO TAKE TO DESCRIBE 1 OF THE 4 CONTEXTUAL FACTORS. THE CLINICIAN COMPONENT INCLUDES BRIEF TRAINING ON: 1) HOW TO RESPOND TO PHOTOS SHARED BY PATIENTS; AND 2) HOW TO DISCUSS CONTEXTUAL FACTORS ELICITED BY THE PHOTOS. THE PATIENT-CLINICIAN COMPONENT IS WHEN PATIENTS BRIEFLY SHARE SELECT PHOTOS WITH CLINICIANS DURING A CLINIC VISIT. THE CAREER GOAL OF THE CANDIDATE, DR. JANE JIH, IS TO BE A LEADER IN THE NATIONAL MISSION TO ACHIEVE HEALTH EQUITY AND A RESEARCH EXPERT ON HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG OLDER ADULTS. HER SHORT-TERM GOALS ARE TO GAIN ADDITIONAL SKILLS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND TEST PATIENT-CENTERED INTERVENTIONS THAT IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR MULTIETHNIC AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE OLDER ADULTS. TO SUPPORT HER CAREER DEVELOPMENT, DR. JIH HAS ASSEMBLED AN EXCEPTIONAL MULTIDISCIPLINARY MENTORING TEAM INCLUDING DR. CHRISTINE RITCHIE, A GERIATRICIAN WITH MCC EXPERTISE AND DR.

THE RESEARCH PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT EMPLOYS ACCEPTED METHODS OF MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION MODELLING AND APPLIES THEM TO NOVEL FIELDS OF MEDEVAC AND ALASKA NATIVE HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED TRAINING GRANT IS IT WILL PROVIDE THE DATA AND THE SKILLS REQUIRED FOR DR. RICE TO SUBSEQUENTLY STUDY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE MODELS AS A DECISION TOOL IN A FUTURE R01-LEVEL APPLICATION. ULTIMATELY, THIS CONTINUUM OF RESEARCH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DECREASE EXPENSES AND IMPROVE SAFETY BY REDIRECTING MEDEVAC RESOURCES TOWARDS PATIENTS WHOSE TIME-SENSITIVE CONDITIONS BENEFIT FROM MEDEVACS AND AWAY FROM PATIENTS THAT INCUR RISK AND COST WITHOUT BENEFIT, BOTH IN ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITIES IN RURAL ALASKA AND FOR ALL AMERICANS LIVING IN RURAL REGIONS NATIONWIDE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0c13d643-4334-38ed-1952-0db7e2ac5e56-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K08MD016445_7529"}, {"internal_id": 134229173, "Award ID": "K08MD015289", "Award Amount": 495847.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-01", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "SOCIO-CULTURAL PROTECTIVE AND RISK FACTORS OF ALCOHOL USE AMONG NON-HISPANIC WHITE AND HISPANIC SEXUAL MINORITY YOUTH - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: NIAAA IDENTIFIES UNDERAGE DRINKING AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.

DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL IS THE CULMINATION OF A LONGER PROCESS OF SCHOOL DISENGAGEMENT THAT STARTS MUCH EARLIER IN DEVELOPMENT. FORTUNATELY, SCHOOL DISENGAGEMENT IS A MODIFIABLE HEALTH DETERMINANT. HOWEVER, A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS AMONG MULTIPLE, UPSTREAM RISK FACTORS FOR SCHOOL DISENGAGEMENT IS NEEDED TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF SCHOOL-BASED PROGRAMMING AIMED AT REDUCING DISTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. EXCLUSIONARY DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES (EDPS) IN SCHOOLS, SUCH AS DETENTIONS AND SUSPENSIONS, ARE CONSISTENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH SCHOOL DISENGAGEMENT. THEY ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY USED AGAINST STUDENTS OF COLOR, WHICH MAY LEAD TO PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION AND FURTHER SCHOOL DISENGAGEMENT, UNDERSCORING THE NOTION THAT EDPS CAN BE A FORM OF RACE-BASED TRAUMA.

THE FOCAL POINT OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO ADAPT AN EXISTING NATIONAL BREASTFEEDING PROGRAM TO IMPROVE BREASTFEEDING INITIATION AND DURATION IN AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKAN NATIVE (AI/AN) COMMUNITIES. BREASTFEEDING PROVIDES ENORMOUS IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM HEALTH BENEFITS FOR BOTH INFANTS AND BIRTHING PEOPLE, REDUCING THE RISK OF OBESITY, DIABETES, AND DEATH IN CHILDREN, AND CANCER, DIABETES, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES IN BIRTHING PEOPLE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE IMPORTANT RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN BREASTFEEDING RATES IN THE UNITED STATES, AND AI/AN COMMUNITIES ARE BOTH LESS LIKELY TO BREASTFEED AND ARE AT GREATER RISK FOR MANY OF THE ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT BREASTFEEDING PROTECTS AGAINST. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL USE METHODS GROUNDED IN COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND HEALTH EQUITY TO ASSESS BARRIERS TO BREASTFEEDING AMONG AI/AN RESIDENTS AT THE LUMMI INDIAN RESERVATION, AND THEN TEST ADAPTATIONS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THOSE BARRIERS AND IMPROVE BREASTFEEDING UPTAKE AND DURATION.

HOWEVER, LIMITATIONS IN THE LITERATURE HINDER OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS OBESITY DISPARITIES. FIRST, SMW ARE OFTEN TREATED AS A HOMOGENEOUS GROUP, SO WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT RISK FACTORS FOR UNDERSTUDIED SUBGROUPS OF SMW (E.G., BISEXUAL, ASEXUAL, QUEER, PANSEXUAL, QUESTIONING). SECOND, AMONG THE LIMITED RESEARCH ON OBESITY OR THE PRIMARY BEHAVIORAL DRIVERS OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY (I.E., ENERGY-BALANCE BEHAVIORS SUCH AS DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND SEDENTARY ACTIVITY) AMONG SMW, THERE IS AN OVERRELIANCE ON CROSS-SECTIONAL, RETROSPECTIVE SELF-REPORT, OR SEMI- ANNUAL LONGITUDINAL DESIGNS.

IMPROVEMENTS IN MEDICAL CARE HAVE TRANSITIONED SCA FROM A DISEASE OF CHILDHOOD INTO A LONG-TERM CHRONIC ILLNESS, AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HAS EMERGED AS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT IN SCA CARE. HYDROXYUREA IS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE PHARMACOTHERAPY TO AMELIORATE THE CLINICAL COURSE OF SCA. HOWEVER, CONCERNS OF TOXIC EFFECTS ON FETUSES AND NEONATES HAVE LIMITED THE USE OF HYDROXYUREA IN PREGNANT OR LACTATING WOMEN. WITHOUT PROVIDING CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT, PATIENTS WITH SCA MAY DEVELOP SEVERE COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS PAIN CRISIS AND STROKE DURING PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM PERIOD.

RESEARCH: PAIN IS A PREVALENT AND CONSEQUENTIAL HEALTH CONCERN. HOWEVER, PAIN CARE IS NOT EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED; FOR EXAMPLE, WHITE AMERICANS RECEIVE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND GUIDELINE-DIRECTED PAIN CARE THAN BLACK AMERICANS. ALTHOUGH THERE IS CONSISTENT EVIDENCE OF PAIN CARE DISPARITIES, THERE IS NO WORK INTEGRATING MODELS OF RACE PERCEPTION OR EXPERIMENTALLY EXAMINING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE PROCESSES TO PAIN CARE DECISIONS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY AND ATTENUATE PROBLEMATIC RACE-PERCEPTION PROCESSES CONTRIBUTING TO RACIAL BIASES IN PAIN TREATMENT. TO TEST THIS OBJECTIVE, DR.

THIS INTERSECTIONALITY OF MULTIPLE LEVELS OF INFLUENCE (INDIVIDUAL, NEIGHBORHOODS, SOCIETY) RESULTS IN HIGHLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AT GREATER RISK FOR DEVELOPING DIABETES, AND LIKELY CONTRIBUTES TO MARKED REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN DIABETES RISK. GIVEN THAT APPROXIMATELY 88 MILLION ADULTS IN THE U.S. HAVE PREDIABETES, AND MOST STRUCTURED DIABETES PREVENTION APPROACHES (E.G. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND MEDICATIONS) REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENT, EFFORTS THAT ENABLE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO PRIORITIZE THE MOST HIGH-RISK PATIENTS WOULD OPTIMIZE BENEFIT. DIABETES RISK PREDICTION MODELS CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH-RISK FOR PROGRESSION TO DIABETES; HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL MODELS INCLUDE CLINICAL PARAMETERS WITH LITTLE INTEGRATION OF SOCIAL FACTORS, IGNORING THE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF INFLUENCE ON DISEASE PREVENTION. THUS, INTEGRATING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) DATA INTO RISK STRATIFICATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS BASED ON CLINICAL AND SOCIAL VULNERABILITIES, FACILITATING BETTER TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AND REDUCTIONS IN DISPARITIES.

AS THE NUMBER OF NEW EC CASES IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE 50% BY 2030, THIS URBAN-RURAL DISPARITY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WIDENING. CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DISPARITY IS THE REDUCED RECEIPT OF GUIDELINE-CONCORDANT TREATMENT; IN PARTICULAR, RURAL PATIENTS WITH EC ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE SURGICAL CARE, THE CORNERSTONE OF REGIONAL STAGE EC TREATMENT.  THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IDENTIFY AND TARGET MULTILEVEL BARRIERS TO RECEIVING GUIDELINE- CONCORDANT TREATMENT AMONG RURAL EC PATIENTS BY DEVELOPING AND PILOTING A PATIENT NAVIGATION INTERVENTION. PATIENT NAVIGATION INTERVENTIONS CAN ADDRESS A MULTITUDE OF BARRIERS FACED BY MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED CANCER PATIENTS AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SHORTEN TIME TO INITIATING TREATMENT, INCREASE RECEIPT OF AND ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT, AND IMPROVE PATIENT SATISFACTION. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION IN THE DESIGN AND DELIVERY OF PATIENT NAVIGATION INTERVENTIONS, DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR NEW CONTEXTS AND POPULATIONS HAS BECOME A MAJOR CHALLENGE; AMONG TREATMENT-RELATED PATIENT NAVIGATION INTERVENTIONS, MOST HAVE FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH BREAST AND COLORECTAL CANCERS. UNLIKE THESE CANCER PATIENTS, EC PATIENTS HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS, SUCH AS REQUIRING TREATMENT TO BE DIRECTED BY A GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGIST, WHO OFTEN ARE ONLY LOCATED NEAR URBAN AREAS OR AT ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. ONLY 10% OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGISTS PRACTICE IN RURAL AREAS, AND AS A RESULT, RURAL EC PATIENTS OFTEN TRAVEL FAR DISTANCES FOR CARE.

HER RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED YOUNG WOMEN'S CONTRACEPTIVE DECISION-MAKING AND HAS EXPLORED THE WAYS IN WHICH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND SYSTEMS CAN DELIVER PATIENT-CENTERED CONTRACEPTIVE CARE. RESEARCH PLAN: WOMEN WITH DIABETES PRIOR TO PREGNANCY HAVE ELEVATED RATES OF MATERNAL AND NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. TYPE 2 DIABETES IS INCREASINGLY PREVALENT AMONG WOMEN DURING THEIR CHILDBEARING YEARS, DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING BLACK AND LATINA WOMEN. TO PREVENT MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH COMPLICATIONS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR ENHANCED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG REPRODUCTIVE-AGED WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES, PARTICULARLY RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES TO IMPLEMENT CLINICAL GUIDELINES FOR IMPROVING REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES AMONG ADULT WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. PATIENT DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS IN PRIMARY CARE REPRESENT A PROMISING IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. THE RESEARCH AIMS ARE: AIM 1: ELUCIDATE REPRODUCTIVE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE PREFERENCES AMONG BLACK AND LATINA WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES, USING PERSON-CENTERED AND STRUCTURAL COMPETENCY FRAMEWORKS. AIM 2: ADAPT AN EXISTING PATIENT DECISION SUPPORT INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT REPRODUCTIVE DECISION-MAKING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH COUNSELING DELIVERY IN PRIMARY CARE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF BLACK AND LATINA REPRODUCTIVE-AGED WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES.

AS A RESULT, THEY EXPERIENCE FREQUENT TRANSITIONS OF CARE, ACROSS PROFESSIONAL ROLES AND CARE SETTINGS AND DURING THESE TRANSITIONS, CMC ARE AT GREAT RISK FOR MEDICATION-RELATED HARM. MOST TRANSITIONAL CARE INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED FROM ADULT CARE SETTINGS AND MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF CMC AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS.

ALTHOUGH ETHNIC MINORITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE MENTAL ILLNESSES SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ASSOCIATED SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH LIKE POVERTY AND DISCRIMINATION, THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO SEEK HELP FROM, HAVE ACCESS TO, OR RECEIVE QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. EFFORTS TO REDRESS SUCH DISPARITIES AND IMPROVE ENGAGEMENT HAVE OFTEN FOCUSED ON ADDING NEW SERVICES OR ALTERING PROVIDER CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING THE IMPLICIT BIASES THEY MAY UNKNOWINGLY HOLD. HOWEVER, RECENT SCIENTIFIC REVIEWS SUGGEST THAT CULTURAL AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATION ITSELF ARE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE CONTINUED PERSISTENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. WHILE IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE HAS ADVANCED OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS AND THE UPTAKE OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES, THERE HAS BEEN COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES AS THEY PERTAIN TO MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. THIS GAP IN RESEARCH MAY BE DUE, IN PART, TO THE RELATIVE LACK OF OPERATIONALIZED CONSTRUCTS OF DISPARITY AT THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL. BASED ON OUR RESEARCH, WE HAVE CONCEPTUALIZED A KEY ORGANIZATIONAL MECHANISM OF DISPARITIES\u2014WHICH WE TERM IMPLICIT ORGANIZATIONAL BIAS (IOB)\u2014OR, THE UNSPOKEN NORMS, BELIEFS, AND EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE WAY CLIENTS SHOULD IDEALLY BEHAVE AND/OR INTERACT WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO GAIN OPTIMAL BENEFIT FROM AVAILABLE SERVICES (E.G., A CLIENT SHOULD BE VERBAL, OPENLY ADMIT A PROBLEM, ACCEPT SERVICES, BE PROACTIVE, BE INDIVIDUALLY-ORIENTED). THESE PREFERRED ORGANIZATIONAL NORMS MAY CONFLICT WITH THE NORMS OF ETHNIC MINORITY PATIENTS, LEADING TO A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF INCONGRUENT, SUBOPTIMAL, OR COMPROMISED CARE. THE PROPOSED CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD SEEKS TO EXTEND THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ON IMPLICIT BIAS BEYOND ITS FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS TO THE LEVEL OF THE ORGANIZATION THROUGH TWO PHASES OF PARTICIPATORY, MIXED METHODS RESEARCH THAT AIM: 1) TO SYSTEMATICALLY OPERATIONALIZE, AND DEVELOP A TOOL TO ASSESS, IMPLICIT ORGANIZATIONAL BIAS AND ITS CONGRUENCE WITH THE CULTURE OF ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES; AND 2) TO EXAMINE THE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE IOB MEASURE AND TEST THE PATHWAYS OF ASSOCIATION OUTLINED IN OUR CONCEPTUAL MODEL.

WE WILL IDENTIFY ESSENTIAL THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS OF SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY (SCT, I.E., SELF-EFFICACY, SOCIAL SUPPORT, SELF-REGULATION, BEHAVIORAL CAPABILITY, OUTCOME EXPECTATIONS, ENVIRONMENT), AS WELL AS BEHAVIORAL AND CULTURAL ATTRIBUTES OF PA AMONG INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED TO ENHANCE THE CULTURAL RELEVANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A PA PROGRAM THROUGH FOCUS GROUPS AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS. FROM FORMATIVE RESEARCH, INPUT FROM JAIL ADMINISTRATION ON FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTATION, AND INVOLVEMENT FROM INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED ON ACCEPTABILITY, WE WILL DEVELOP A ROBUST PA PROGRAM TO PROMOTE REC- TIME ATTENDANCE AND INCREASE PA AMONG INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED. ONCE DEVELOPED, WE WILL DETERMINE FEASIBILITY PRELIMINARY IMPACT OF A PA PROGRAM USING A TWO-ARMED CLUSTERED RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL TO RANDOMIZE 18 HOUSING UNITS TO EITHER AN INTERVENTION OR CONTROL ARM. STUDY OUTCOMES INCLUDE REC-TIME ATTENDANCE, PA LEVELS AT REC-TIME, SELF-EFFICACY, EXPECTATIONS AND VALUES OF PA, PERCEIVED BEHAVIOR OF OTHERS, SLEEP QUALITY, STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. THE POTENTIAL INDIVIDUAL GAINS FROM EVEN ONE BOUT OF PA ARE SUBSTANTIAL. PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTEND AND BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE DURING REC-TIME MAY IMPROVE HEALTH CONDITIONS IN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS RESEARCH PLAN IS COMPLEMENTED BY A TRAINING PLAN THAT BUILDS ON THE APPLICANT\u2019S BACKGROUND IN EPIDEMIOLOGY THAT INCLUDES NEW TRAINING IN (1) QUALITATIVE AND MIXED METHODS, (2) INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION, AND (3) CLINICAL TRIALS. THE COMBINED RESEARCH AND TRAINING PLANS WILL PREPARE THE APPLICANT FOR A SUCCESSFUL, INDEPENDENT RESEARCH CAREER FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING APPROACHES TO PROMOTE PA AND REDUCE RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG INCARCERATED POPULATIONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AZ", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7b52fa5f-5875-14d7-6b49-dba3db4692f2-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01MD015749_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110862307, "Award ID": "K01MD015326", "Award Amount": 385123.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-24", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "DIMENSIONS OF EARLY LIFE ADVERSITY AND SELF-REGULATION: PEDIATRIC OBESITY RISK PATHWAYS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fb9c32ae-42fd-5fe8-5d84-b798a26bb49d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01MD015326_7529"}, {"internal_id": 108463431, "Award ID": "K01MD015304", "Award Amount": 514572.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-10", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "GEOGRAPHIC AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING AND BARRIERS TO RECEIVING CARE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "aca87389-2cb6-91e2-17a4-df7e81a7314d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01MD015304_7529"}, {"internal_id": 133584804, "Award ID": "K01MD015295", "Award Amount": 400780.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-08", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "HEALTHYCELLS: A CULTURALLY-TAILORED SMOKING CESSATION SMARTPHONE INTERVENTION FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS WITH ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR - PROJECT ABSTRACT  SUCCESSFULLY INCREASING CESSATION RATES AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS WOULD REDUCE THE RACIAL DISPARITY IN MORTALITY BETWEEN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND WHITES BY UP TO 20%. MANY SMOKING CESSATION INTERVENTIONS INCLUDE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COMPONENTS TO BOOST CESSATION RATES, BUT NO STUDIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO PROMOTE SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR REDUCTION AS A CESSATION STRATEGY. FURTHER, SMARTPHONES CAN FACILITATE INTENSIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS WITHOUT REQUIRING BURDENSOME IN-PERSON TREATMENT, AND THESE INTERVENTIONS CAN BE TAILORED TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND CAPITALIZE ON CULTURAL STRENGTHS TO REDUCE BARRIERS AND ENCOURAGE BEHAVIOR CHANGE. OUR RESEARCH TEAM HAS DEVELOPED NUMEROUS SMARTPHONE INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS A RANGE OF MODIFIABLE HEALTH RISK FACTORS AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF BEING CULTURALLY TAILORED FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. OF RELEVANCE TO THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL, ONE IS A SMARTPHONE-BASED CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL REWARDS FOR SMOKING ABSTINENCE AFTER REMOTE VERIFICATION OF SMOKING STATUS USING LOW-COST PORTABLE CARBON MONOXIDE MONITORS AND FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE (I.E., PREVAILGO). THE OTHER IS A SMARTPHONE-BASED SEDENTARY REDUCTION INTERVENTION THAT USES WRIST-WORN ACTIVITY MONITORS IN COMBINATION WITH SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGY TO MONITOR ACTIVITY IN REAL-TIME AND DELIVER ACTIVITY PROMPTS WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE ENGAGED IN PROLONGED BOUTS OF SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR (I.E., SMARTPATH). MY LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO IMPROVE SMOKING CESSATION OUTCOMES AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS USING EVIDENCE-BASED, CULTURALLY TAILORED SMARTPHONE INTERVENTIONS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL, WHICH IS THE NEXT STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING THIS LONG-TERM GOAL, ARE TO (A) CREATE A SMARTPHONE APPLICATION FOR SMOKING CESSATION (I.E., HEALTHYCELLS), WHICH WILL BE ACHIEVED BY INTEGRATING TWO PRE-EXISTING EVIDENCE-BASED SMARTPHONE INTERVENTIONS, PREVAILGO AND SMARTPATH, (B) CREATE CULTURALLY TAILORED TREATMENT CONTENT (I.E., MESSAGES, IMAGES, AND VIDEOS) FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN SMOKERS, AND (C) EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF HEALTHYCELLS AT ADDRESSING SMOKING AND SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS. A PILOT SAMPLE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN SMOKERS (N = 15) WILL BRIEFLY USE THE HEALTHYCELLS APP AND PROVIDE CRITICAL FEEDBACK THROUGH SEMI- STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS TO REFINE THE SMARTPHONE INTERVENTION. ONCE THE HEALTHYCELLS APP IS REFINED, AFRICAN AMERICANS (N = 30) WHO ARE INTERESTED IN QUITTING SMOKING WILL USE THE APP DURING A SCHEDULED QUIT ATTEMPT. STARTING ON THE SCHEDULED QUIT DATE, HEALTHYCELLS WILL PROMPT PARTICIPANTS TO COMPLETE TWICE-DAILY REMOTE SMOKING STATUS ASSESSMENTS TO EARN REWARDS FOR ABSTINENCE. THE APP WILL DELIVER REAL-TIME MESSAGES TELLING PARTICIPANTS TO STAND UP AND MOVE AROUND DURING PROLONGED BOUTS OF SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR (I.E., = 30 MINUTES OF UNINTERRUPTED TIME SPENT IN A SITTING, RECLINING, OR LYING POSTURE). PARTICIPANTS WILL ALSO HAVE ON-DEMAND ACCESS TO CULTURALLY TAILORED INFORMATION AND STRATEGIES FOR REMAINING ABSTINENT AND REDUCING SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE HEALTHYCELLS APP. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WILL BE BIOCHEMICALLY CONFIRMED POINT PREVALENCE SMOKING ABSTINENCE AT 8 WEEKS POST-QUIT DATE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IN SEDENTARY TIME 7 CONSECUTIVE DAYS BEFORE QUITTING COMPARED WITH 7 CONSECUTIVE DAYS AT 8-WEEKS POST-QUIT, AS MEASURED BY A RESEARCH- GRADE ACCELEROMETER.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OK", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "35c9af52-79d6-b585-258b-ae9342223de1-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01MD015295_7529"}, {"internal_id": 107115335, "Award ID": "K01MD015291", "Award Amount": 533003.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-07-26", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "SYSTEMS SCIENCE APPROACHES TO UNDERSTAND NEIGHBORHOOD OPPORTUNITY AND RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL MORBIDITY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "867850a1-1693-4b2a-3ff5-034554d322e1-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01MD015291_7529"}, {"internal_id": 109190122, "Award ID": "K01MD015290", "Award Amount": 399741.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-07-30", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "OPTIMIZING A DYADIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTION FOR HISPANICS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS AND THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUPPORTER", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f371179b-9f27-8013-f81c-4fd314b1f981-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01MD015290_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110862755, "Award ID": "K01MD015194", "Award Amount": 361122.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-25", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "INFLUENCE OF DIETARY PATTERN AND RACE ON METABOLIC AND EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER DEVELOPMENT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d341f7fa-7acc-937e-a91f-a75c75e6796e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01MD015194_7529"}, {"internal_id": 131832881, "Award ID": "K01MD015079", "Award Amount": 373701.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-01", "CFDA Number": "93.307", "Description": "FAMILY HEALTH HISTORIES: CREATING A CULTURALLY TAILORED TOOL TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY - AFRICAN AMERICANS (AA) SUFFER DISPROPORTIONATELY ACROSS MOST HEALTH DISPARITIES (HD).

FAMILY HEALTH HISTORIES (FHH), WHICH DESCRIBE GENETIC AND OTHER FAMILIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION AND SCREENINGS. THE UNDERUTILIZATION OF FHHS IN AA COMMUNITIES NEGATIVELY IMPACTS SCREENING AND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES THAT COULD PREVENT THE ONSET OF DISEASE, ILLNESS AND ULTIMATELY DEATH.4 ALTHOUGH MANY FHH TOOLKITS HAVE BEEN CREATED TO ASSIST FAMILIES IN GATHERING FHH INFORMATION, THESE TOOLS TYPICALLY ARE MOSTLY FOCUSED FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION AND DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CULTURAL AND ETHNIC NUANCES, COMMUNICATION PREFERENCE AND HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY.4 THE FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE AA IN THE CREATION AND CONCEPTION OF CULTURALLY RELEVANT FHH TOOLS AND ACTIVITIES TO DATE LIKELY CONTRIBUTES TO THEIR UNDERUTILIZATION IN THIS POPULATION.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS K01 IS TO DEVELOP CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FHH TOOLS DESIGNED FOR BROAD UNDERSTANDING AND UPTAKE IN AA COMMUNITIES. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT, USING A COMMUNITY BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR) APPROACH, CO-DEVELOPMENT OF A CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FHH TOOLKIT WILL INCREASE THE UTILITY AND ENGAGEMENT OF AA FAMILIES IN FHH ACTIVITIES; INCREASE EFFECTIVE HEALTH COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE FAMILY STRUCTURE; AND INCREASE THE HEALTH LITERACY OF PARTICIPANTS IN A MULTIFACETED EFFORT TO REDUCE AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES. FLINT IS AN IDEAL COMMUNITY IN WHICH TO CONDUCT THIS PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH BECAUSE THE RECENT EVENTS OF THE FLINT WATER CRISIS HAVE CREATED INTEREST IN GENETICS AND FHH IN THE AA COMMUNITY AS A RESULT OF COMMUNITY CONCERN AROUND THE GENERATIONAL IMPACTS OF BACTERIA AND LEAD EXPOSURE ON HEALTH.

PROJECT SUMMARY THE APPROVAL OF VENETOCLAX/AZACITIDINE FRONTLINE THERAPY IN NOVEMBER 2018 SHIFTED THE LONG-LIVED PARADIGM OF \u201c7+3\u201d-BASED INDUCTION THERAPY AND MARKS THE NEW ERA OF MODERN AML CARE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TARGETED THERAPIES SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVES THE OUTCOMES FOR SOME PATIENTS AND OFFERS LESS INTENSE TREATMENT OPTIONS TO MANY IN THE OUTPATIENT AND/OR LOCAL SETTING. ALONG WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, THE IMPACT OF RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED IN AML, WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY BE RELATED TO THE DIFFERENCES IN DISEASE BIOLOGY, BUT ALSO DUE TO DISPARITY IN SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF STRUCTURAL RACISM. NEW CHALLENGES ON APPROPRIATE TESTING, RESPONSE/TOXICITY MONITORING, THERAPY ADJUSTMENT AND SOCIAL SUPPORT ARISE WITH THE WIDE ADOPTION OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC AGENTS, THREATENING TO FURTHER WIDEN THE DISPARITIES IN AML CARE. CURRENTLY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE AND MECHANISMS OF THE IMPACT OF RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES ON AML SURVIVAL IN THE NOVEL THERAPY ERA. TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THESE KNOWLEDGE GAPS, WE WILL PERFORM A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY USING DATA FROM FLATIRON ENHANCED DATAMART, A NATIONWIDE DATABASE UNIQUELY FEATURING A DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATION, COMPREHENSIVE PATHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR DATA, AND EXCELLENT DATA RECENCY. IN OUR FIRST AIM, WE WILL ASSESS THE DISPARITIES IN OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) BETWEEN 1) NHB AND NHW PATIENTS AND 2) HISPANIC AND NHW PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED AML IN THE PRE- AND POST-NOVEL THERAPY ERA, RESPECTIVELY, TO DEMONSTRATE THE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN OS DISPARITIES SPECIFICALLY IN MODERN AML CARE. IN OUR SECOND AIM, WE WILL ASSESS THE MECHANISMS OF OS DISPARITIES IN MODERN AML CARE BY DECOMPOSING THE TOTAL EFFECTS AND EXPLORING THE CAUSAL PATHWAY OF RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN AML OS USING MODERN CAUSAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS. IN AIM 2A, WE WILL FIRST PERFORM A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE DIFFERENCES OF BASELINE AML GENETIC PROFILING ACROSS RACIAL GROUPS. FINDING(S) IN AIM 2A, ALONG WITH OTHER BIOLOGICAL AND NON-BIOLOGICAL VARIABLES, WILL THEN BE EVALUATED AS POTENTIAL MEDIATORS OF AML OS DISPARITIES IN AIM 2B. ULTIMATELY, THE SECOND AIM WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE OBSERVED OS DISPARITIES IN MODERN AML CARE AND HELP IDENTIFY POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR INTERVENTION TO MAKE MORE MEANINGFUL ADVANCES TOWARDS THE MITIGATION OF SUCH DISPARITIES. THESE RESULTS WILL HELP UNDERSTAND THE DISPARITIES AND HIGHLIGHT THE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES RACIAL MINORITY GROUPS ARE FACING IN MODERN AML CARE SO THAT SUBSEQUENT STUDIES AND INTERVENTIONS CAN BE IMPROVED FOR THIS PATIENT POPULATION. IN ADDITION, THE TRAINING PROVIDED BY THIS AWARD WILL AFFORD THE APPLICANT WITH SKILLS IMPORTANT FOR HER DEVELOPMENT INTO AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR IN THE FIELD OF LEUKEMIA AND MYELOID MALIGNANCIES.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL TEST THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESES: 1) LABORATORY MEASURES OF CHILDREN\u2019S RACIAL BIASES CAN BE USED TO CAPTURE STABLE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN CHILDREN\u2019S RACE-RELATED BEHAVIORS; 2) TEACHERS UNDERESTIMATE CHILDREN\u2019S RACIAL BIASES, BUT WHEN TEACHERS ARE MORE AWARE OF CHILDREN\u2019S BIASES, THEY ARE MORE MOTIVATED TO ADDRESS RACE WITH THEIR STUDENTS; 3) TEACHERS OF COLOR (VS. WHITE) TEACHERS AND TEACHERS IN CLASSROOMS WITH A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF BLACK STUDENTS ARE MORE MOTIVATED TO ADDRESS CHILDREN\u2019S ANTI-BLACK BIASES (BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE AWARE OF SUCH BIASES); AND 4) TEACHERS FACE BOTH STRUCTURAL (E.G., NOT IN THE CURRICULUM) AND INDIVIDUAL (E.G., DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO) BARRIERS TO ADDRESSING RACE WITH THEIR STUDENTS.

THESE CARDIOMETABOLIC OUTCOMES PUT BLACK YOUTH AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEART DISEASE, WHICH KILLS BLACK ADULTS AT TWICE THE RATE OF WHITE ADULTS. RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND POOR SLEEP ARE THEORIZED AS KEY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH. WHILE STUDIES IN ADULTS SUGGEST THAT SLEEP MAY SERVE AS A PATHWAY THROUGH WHICH DISCRIMINATION INFLUENCES CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH, THERE IS A CRITICAL GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PATHWAY IN ADOLESCENTS. IN CONTRAST, COMMUNITY LEVEL-SUPPORTS MAY PROTECT BLACK YOUTH AGAINST STRESSORS, INCLUDING THE INFLUENCE OF RACISM AND POOR SLEEP.

THERE ARE ALSO SUBSTANTIAL RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CHILDHOOD POVERTY. IN 2019, 8.3 PERCENT OF WHITE CHILDREN AND 7.3 PERCENT OF ASIAN CHILDREN WERE LIVING IN POVERTY, WHILE 20.9 PERCENT OF HISPANIC CHILDREN AND 26.4 PERCENT OF BLACK CHILDREN WERE LIVING IN POVERTY. ADULTS WHO EXPERIENCED CHILDHOOD POVERTY ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES COMPARED TO ADULTS WHO DID NOT EXPERIENCE CHILDHOOD POVERTY, INCLUDING 50% LOWER ODDS OF REPORTING GOOD GENERAL HEALTH AND 71% HIGHER ODDS OF HAVING HEART DISEASE. CHILDHOOD POVERTY\u2019S IMPACT ON SUBSEQUENT ADULT HEALTH IS WELL- DOCUMENTED, BUT FEW STUDIES EXAMINE THE LONG-TERM EFFECT OF ECONOMIC POLICIES ON THIS RELATIONSHIP. WELFARE REFORM REPRESENTED A MAJOR SHIFT IN THE 1990S IN HOW THE UNITED STATES DISTRIBUTED CASH BENEFITS TO AMERICANS NEEDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT. ABOUT 25 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE STATES BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO WELFARE, SHIFTING FROM A LESS RESTRICTIVE AND MORE GENEROUS FORM OF WELFARE DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE AID TO FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN (AFDC) PROGRAM, TO A MORE PUNITIVE AND LESS GENEROUS FORM, THROUGH THE TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE TO NEEDY FAMILIES (TANF) PROGRAM. AT ITS HEIGHT IN 1994, AFDC SERVED 9.6 MILLION CHILDREN, WHILE TANF SERVED ONLY 1.6 MILLION CHILDREN IN 2020, SUGGESTING A LARGE DECREASE IN WELFARE BENEFITS DISTRIBUTION. DUE TO THE CLOSE LINK BETWEEN FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND HEALTH, ECONOMIC POLICIES SERVE AS POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE POPULATION HEALTH AND DECREASE SOCIOECONOMIC (SES) HEALTH DISPARITIES. STUDIES ON WELFARE REFORM HAVE FOUND IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS OF THIS POLICY CHANGE ON SHORT-TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES, INCLUDING REDUCED ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE AND DECREASED HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE LONG-TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES DUE TO WELFARE REFORM, THOUGH RESEARCH IN THIS AREA IS LIMITED. STUDIES ON LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF OTHER SAFETY-NET POLICIES, SUCH AS THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM, HAVE FOUND THAT MORE BENEFITS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER LONG-TERM HEALTH.

AS BEHAVIORS ESTABLISHED DURING YOUNG ADULT YEARS ARE LIKELY TO PERSIST IN ADULTHOOD AND BECAUSE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN HAVE THE HIGHEST PREVALENCE OF OBESITY AND ARE AT HIGHEST RISK FOR WEIGHT GAIN DURING THIS TIME, YOUNG ADULTHOOD IS A PRIME INTERVENTION TARGET FOR ESTABLISHING HEALTHY BEHAVIORS RELATED TO WEIGHT MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTING WEIGHT GAIN WITHIN THIS POPULATION. SOCIAL INFLUENCES ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN WEIGHT MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORS. THE SOCIAL UNDERMINING OF WEIGHT MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORS CAN BE DEFINED AS SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OR EVENTS THAT THREATEN GOAL ATTAINMENT OF WEIGHT MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORS (I.E., CERTAIN EATING BEHAVIORS OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY), WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR NOT. SOCIAL UNDERMINING IS PREVALENT AND MAY BE MORE PREVALENT AMONG YOUNG ADULTS DUE TO A HEIGHTENED INVOLVEMENT IN A VARIETY OF SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS AND GROUPS. SOCIAL UNDERMINING IS AN IMPORTANT INTERVENTION TARGET AS IT MAY LEAD TO DIETARY AND EXERCISE LAPSES, WHICH MAY CREATE ENERGY IMBALANCES AND CONTRIBUTE TO WEIGHT GAIN.

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF UNDERMINING MAY DIFFER ACROSS COMMUNITIES, AND AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT TYPES OF UNDERMINING OR RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO UNDERMINING DUE TO VARIOUS CULTURAL FACTORS (E.G., BODY IMAGE, HIGH CULTURAL VALUE OF TRADITIONAL FOODS).

HOWEVER, THE IMMIGRANT HEALTH ADVANTAGE IS SEEN IN SOME HEALTH OUTCOMES BUT NOT ALL OUTCOMES. THERE ARE TWO MAIN ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY THERE MAY NOT BE AN IMMIGRANT HEALTH ADVANTAGE FOR ALL HEALTH OUTCOMES. FIRST, THERE ARE METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS IN COMPARING IMMIGRANTS TO U.S.-BORN PEOPLE. BOTH OFTEN GROW UP IN DISTINCT SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH AUTOMATICALLY ALLOWS RESEARCHERS TO FIND DIFFERENCES. MOREOVER, MANY ANALYSES INVOLVE CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA, TYPICALLY COLLECTED YEARS AFTER IMMIGRANTS MIGRATE. USING CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA LIMIT ONE\u2019S ABILITY TO EXAMINE IF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IMMIGRANTS AND U.S.-BORN PEOPLE ARE DUE TO IMMIGRATION ITSELF OR IF THEY EXISTED PRIOR TO IMMIGRATION. TO ADDRESS THIS METHODOLOGICAL CRITIQUE, A STUDY THAT USES LONGITUDINAL DATA AND ALLOWS FOR COMPARISON OF IMMIGRANTS TO A MORE APPROPRIATE COUNTERFACTUAL GROUP \u2013 THOSE WHO DO NOT MIGRATE \u2013 MAY BE NEEDED. IN ADDITION TO THIS METHODOLOGICAL CRITIQUE, THE STRESSES OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION MAY BE ANOTHER REASON WHY THE IMMIGRANT HEALTH ADVANTAGE DOES NOT EXIST FOR ALL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE STRESSES OF INTEGRATION CAN COME IN MANY FORMS INCLUDING THE DIFFICULTIES IMMIGRANTS EXPERIENCE IN SECURING STABLE INCOME (FINANCIAL STRAIN) AND DISCRIMINATION BASED ON ONE\u2019S IMMIGRATION STATUS. HOWEVER, SOME FACTORS PROTECT IMMIGRANTS FROM POOR HEALTH; IMMIGRANTS\u2019 SOCIAL CAPITAL COULD REDUCE THE STRESSES OF INTEGRATION OR INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH PROMOTING RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS IN THE LITERATURE, THIS PROJECT WILL EXAMINE THE FOLLOWING AIMS. FIRST, I WILL EXAMINE HOW IMMIGRANTS DIFFER FROM THEIR NON-MIGRANT COUNTERPARTS FOR THREE HEALTH OUTCOMES: ALLOSTATIC LOAD, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND SLEEP QUALITY. DIFFERENCES IN ALLOSTATIC LOAD WILL BE EXAMINED AT BASELINE WHILE DIFFERENCES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND SLEEP QUALITY WILL BE EXAMINED BOTH AT BASELINE AND OVER A 3-YEAR FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. SECOND, I WILL EXPLORE HOW THREE FACTORS RELATED TO THE STRESS OF INTEGRATION \u2013 FINANCIAL STRAIN, INTERPERSONAL DISCRIMINATION, AND SOCIAL CAPITAL \u2013 CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO 3-YEAR FOLLOW-UP. FINALLY, I WILL DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF EACH HEALTH OUTCOME TO EACH FACTOR OF STRESS OF INTEGRATION. TO EXAMINE THESE AIMS, I WILL CONDUCT A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF THE BASELINE, 1-YEAR, 2-YEAR, AND 3-YEAR DATA OF AN ONGOING LONGITUDINAL STUDY, THE HEALTH OF PHILIPPINE EMIGRANTS STUDY (HOPES) (N=1637).

PAST RESEARCH INDICATES THAT IMMIGRANT GENERATION IS A MORE MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF SUICIDALITY THAN RACIAL/ETHNIC CATEGORIZATION. BASED ON COMPREHENSIVE FINDINGS FROM THE NATIONAL LATINO AND ASIAN AMERICAN STUDY, SUICIDE IS A GROWING CONCERN PARTICULARLY AMONG SECOND-GENERATION IMMIGRANTS. HALF OF ALL SECOND-GENERATION IMMIGRANTS ARE RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES, NAMELY LATINOS AND ASIANS. ASIANS ARE THE ONLY RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP FOR WHICH SUICIDE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG EARLY ADULTS AGE 18-24. AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES, SUICIDE REMAINS A TOP FIVE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH UNTIL AGE 55 ONLY IN ASIANS. DESPITE THIS DISPARITY, THERE IS A SEVERE DEARTH OF EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH INITIATIVES TARGETING SUICIDE THROUGH AN IDENTITY-BASED APPROACH IN RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS. PAST EVIDENCE FROM MINORITY STRESS THEORY SUGGESTS STRONG ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN IDENTITY-BASED STIGMA AND SUICIDE. HOWEVER, MINORITY STRESS THEORY LACKS AN INTERSECTIONAL STIGMA PERSPECTIVE INCORPORATING MULTIPLE MINORITY IDENTITIES. ADAPTING THIS THEORY TO INCLUDE INTERSECTIONAL STIGMA ENHANCES ITS APPLICABILITY TO RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES, MANY OF WHOM IDENTIFY WITH MULTIPLE STIGMATIZED SUBGROUPS. MOREOVER, MERGING THE INTERPERSONAL THEORY OF SUICIDE TO MINORITY STRESS ALLOWS SCIENTISTS TO INVESTIGATE THE PATHWAY OF BELONGINGNESS TO SUICIDE FROM AN INTERSECTIONAL STIGMA PERSPECTIVE. THE PROPOSED STUDY SIGNIFIES A PRESSING RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY TO UNCOVER NEW INSIGHTS ON UNDERSTANDING SUICIDE THROUGH THIS INNOVATIVE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK IN A SUBGROUP OF ASIANS. THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A PILOT STUDY USING A NOVEL STUDY DESIGN INTEGRATING COMPLEX METHODS FROM MULTI-LEVEL NATIONAL, COMMUNITY, AND INDIVIDUAL DATA. THE STUDY PURPOSE IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND BELONGINGNESS AS IT RELATES TO SUICIDE FROM THE COMPLEX PERSPECTIVE OF INTERSECTIONAL STIGMA, PARTICULARLY IN EARLY ADULT ASIANS WHO IDENTIFY WITH MULTIPLE STIGMATIZED SUBGROUPS (ETHNICITY, IMMIGRANT, FAITH), THROUGH THE FOLLOWING AIMS: AIM 1: TO TEST THE POTENTIAL MEDIATING EFFECT OF BELONGINGNESS TO INTERSECTIONAL STIGMA AND SUICIDE-RELATED OUTCOMES (STRESS, DEPRESSION, SUICIDAL IDEATION) IN A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF ASIANS WITH MULTIPLE STIGMATIZED IDENTITIES; AIM 2: IDENTIFY IDENTITY-SPECIFIC (ETHNICITY, IMMIGRANT, FAITH) RISK AND RESILIENCE FACTORS OF SUICIDALITY IN AN ASIAN COMMUNITY; AIM 3: EXPLORE THE MEANING OF BELONGINGNESS FROM THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF INTERSECTIONAL STIGMA THROUGH IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH ASIAN INDIVIDUALS. THE FELLOWSHIP RESEARCH OBJECTIVE IS TO CONDUCT A HYPOTHESIS-GENERATING PILOT STUDY ON THE RISK AND RESILIENCE FACTORS OF SUICIDE USING A NOVEL APPROACH THAT IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT TO RACIAL MINORITIES. THE FELLOWSHIP TRAINING GOALS ARE TO: (1) GAIN PROFICIENCY IN ADVANCED METHODOLOGICAL SKILLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH; (2) ENHANCE EXPERTISE IN CONDUCTING SUICIDE AND MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH IN IMMIGRANT RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS; AND (3) PUBLISH 5 FIRST AUTHOR PEER-REVIEWED MANUSCRIPTS TO ADVANCE AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH CAREER.

WHILE THESE RATES OF MENTAL ILLNESS ARE SIMILAR TO URBAN AREAS, INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN RURAL REGIONS FACE A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF NEGATIVE PSYCHIATRIC OUTCOMES. MODERN ADVANCES IN PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH HAVE FOCUSED ON USING MACHINE LEARNING AND HUMAN NEUROIMAGING TO PREDICT DIAGNOSES AND TREATMENT OUTCOMES.

MEDICAID EXPANSION IS A CRITICAL ANTIPOVERTY TOOL THAT PROTECTS INDIVIDUALS FROM HEALTH CARE COSTS AND REDUCES FOOD AND HOUSING INSECURITY, SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO POOR HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES. MEDICAID EXPANSION INCREASES ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE, A HYPOTHESIZED MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS PUBLIC INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS REDUCES SOCIAL NEEDS.

THIS PROJECT IS SUPERVISED BY DRS. ADRIENNE STRONG, CLARENCE GRAVLEE (DEPT. OF ANTHROPOLOGY), RAMZI SALLOUM (DEPT. OF HEALTH OUTCOMES AND BIOINFORMATICS), AND GRANT HARRELL (DEPT. OF COMMUNITY HEALTH AND FAMILY MEDICINE) WITH THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA (UF) COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES, THE UF COLLEGE OF MEDICINE AND THE UF CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES INSTITUTE. THE PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO EQUIP THE TRAINEE WITH THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO BECOME A PHYSICIAN-SCIENTIST WHO BRIDGES THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND CLINICAL MEDICINE. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDH) ARE KNOWN TO IMPACT A WIDE ARRAY OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PHYSICIANS IDENTIFY AND INTERPRET PATIENT SOCIAL INFORMATION, AND ACT UPON THIS INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THEIR PATIENT\u2019S HEALTH AND WELLBEING. THIS PROPOSAL WILL FOCUS ON US OUTPATIENT PRIMARY CARE CLINICS FOR TWO REASONS: PRIMARY CARE PRIORITIZES HOLISTIC WELL-BEING OF PATIENTS THROUGH THE LIFE COURSE AND THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PUSH IN RECENT YEARS TO INCORPORATE SDH INTERVENTIONS INTO PRIMARY CARE CLINICS. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON DEVELOPMENT OF SCREENING TOOLS AND LIMITED INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON SPECIAL POPULATIONS OR SPECIFIC SDH. SUCH INVESTIGATIONS PAY LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE INFORMAL METHODS PROVIDERS AND PRIMARY CARE CLINICS HAVE DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CLINICALLY RELEVANT SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN DAY-TO-DAY PRACTICE, ACTIVITIES HERE COLLECTIVELY TERMED \u201cSOCIAL PRESCRIBING\u201d.

THE BURDEN OF POOR CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON IMPOVERISHED AND NON-WHITE COMMUNITIES WHERE STRUCTURAL RACISM LIMITS ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE, THUS IMPACTING HEALTH OUTCOMES. SOCIAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING (SHP) IS AN INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO MITIGATE ADVERSE SOCIAL EXPERIENCES BY EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR POOR HEALTH. SHP FOR ADOLESCENTS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND MITIGATE CERTAIN CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING POOR NUTRITION AND EXPOSURE TO PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESSORS. HOWEVER, THE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF ADOLESCENT PARTICIPATION IN SHP ON CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND ITS IMPACT ON FUTURE PREGNANCIES ARE NOT KNOWN. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL PARTNER WITH A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM OFFERING SHP (GIRLS INC., OMAHA) TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SHP WITH NUTRITIONAL AND EMOTIONAL RESILIENCY COMPONENTS WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT ADOLESCENT MODIFIERS OF ADULT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE WILL COMPARE NUTRITIONAL ANTIOXIDANT STATUS (SPECIFIC AIM 1), HAIR/SALIVA CORTISOL LEVELS (SPECIFIC AIM 2), AND VASCULAR ELASTICITY (SPECIFIC AIM 3) IN CURRENT/FORMER SHP PARTICIPANTS VERSUS AGE-MATCHED CONTROLS. DIETARY PATTERNS AND EMOTIONAL RESILIENCY WILL BE MEASURED USING VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES.

A PLAN \u2013 ADVANCING SCIENCE FOR THE HEALTH OF WOMEN, THE TRANS-NIH STRATEGIC PLAN FOR WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH RESEARCH \u2013 WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE PERIOD 2019 \u2013 2023. THIS PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK THAT RECOGNIZES THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT AFFECT WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE, INCLUDING PREGNANCY. LIFE COURSE THEORY POSITS THAT HEALTH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS BEFORE CONCEPTION AND CONTINUES ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN. IT SUGGESTS THAT A COMPLEX PLAY OF BIOLOGIC, BEHAVIORAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL PROTECTIVE AND RISK FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND THAT HEALTH STATUS REFLECTS THE CUMULATIVE LIFETIME EXPOSURE TO THESE FACTORS. THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THIS PLAN ARE CONSIDERATION OF THE COMPLEX FACTORS AFFECTING WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH, THE INCLUSION OF DIVERSE POPULATIONS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, AND ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF A DIVERSE GROUP OF SCIENTISTS.7 THE NIH APPROACH TO REDUCING MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WILL AIM TO ENHANCE HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH, INCREASE THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AND OTHER RISK FACTORS (INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS), IMPROVE CARE (ANTEPARTUM, INTRAPARTUM AND POSTPARTUM) AND MANAGEMENT, PROVIDE INSIGHT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPOSURES SUCH AS STRESS, DISCRIMINATION AND CAREGIVING, UNDERSTAND COPING BEHAVIORS IN FAMILIES AFFECTED BY MATERNAL MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY, AND INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS REGARDING PREGNANCY.8 WITHIN NHLBI, MATERNAL AND WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH PRIORITIES SPAN ALL OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE NHLBI STRATEGIC VISION, AND NHLBI HAS SUPPORTED A NUMBER OF MATERNAL HEALTH PROGRAMS LOOKING AT HYPERTENSION, SLEEP DISORDERS, AND OTHER PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING PRE-ECLAMPSIA, ECLAMPSIA, AND GESTATIONAL DIABETES. THE GOAL OF THE NHLBI 3M ADMINISTRATIVE COORDINATING CENTER (3M ACC) IS TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES AND NETWORKS IN AREAS THAT EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THE 3M ACC WILL SUPPORT THE PRELIMINARY WORK NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY AND PREPARE A GROUP OF COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO RESPOND TO FUTURE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES.
