THERE ARE ONLY TWO KNOWN POPULATIONS OF DESERT YELLOWHEAD IN THE  WORLD, BOTH POPULATIONS OCCUR ON LANDS MANAGED BY THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (BLM)  LANDER FIELD OFFICE. IN 2021 WE INITIATED A STUDY THAT MEASURED BOTH SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL  REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY, WHILE MEASURING WEATHER CONDITIONS TO ESTIMATE THE DEGREE TO WHICH  MOISTURE LIMITED THIS THREATENED PLANT. THE CURRENT PROJECT ENDS IN 2022, BUT CONTINUAL DROUGHT  CONDITIONS WILL LIKELY LIMIT OUR INFERENCE ABOUT REPRODUCTION IN THIS PLANT. WE ARE PROPOSING TO  CONTINUE TO MONITOR CLIMATE AND MEASURE REPRODUCTION, AS WELL AS DEVELOP A PRACTICAL MONITORING  SCHEME FOR BOTH POPULATIONS. IN 2018, WE COLLECTED DESERT YELLOWHEAD SEEDS AS PART OF A POLLINATION AND SEED SET STUDY,  BECAUSE SPECIALIZED PLANTS CAN HAVE SPECIALIZED POLLINATORS. IF THESE SPECIALIZED POLLINATORS  DECLINE, SEED PRODUCTION CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED. HOWEVER, WE DISCOVERED THAT POLLINATORS DID  NOT LIMIT SEED PRODUCTION IN DESERT YELLOWHEAD DURING 2018, BUT SOMETHING ELSE DID. SIXTEEN  PERCENT OF SEEDS WERE VIABLE IN THE INSECT POLLINATED TREATMENT OF THE SAND DRAW POPULATION AND  0% OF SEEDS WERE VIABLE IN THE CEDAR RIM POPULATION. WE ARE PROPOSING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR  CLIMATE AND MEASURE REPRODUCTION. CONTINUING TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE ON THE REPRODUCTION  OF DESERT YELLOWHEAD WOULD PROVIDE A MUCH BETTER DEPICTION OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE  POPULATIONS TO FURTHER PROTECT THIS RARE SPECIES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT MONITORING  BASED ON PAST RESEARCH IN BOTH DESERT YELLOWHEAD POPULATIONS TO ESTIMATE CHANGES IN POPULATIONS  OVER TIME. OUR PROPOSAL DEVELOPED FROM THE CURRENT INTERESTS IN MONITORING RARE SPECIES, THE  POTENTIAL DECREASE IN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION, INCREASES IN AIR TEMPERATURE AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,  AND THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTION OF DESERT YELLOWHEAD. DESERT YELLOWHEAD IS LISTED AS THREATENED UNDER THE US ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT (USDI FISH AND  WILDLIFE SERVICE 2002). THIS UNIQUE PLANT WAS DISCOVERED BY ROBERT DORN IN 1990 AT SAND DRAW  (DORN 1991) AND A SECOND POPULATION, CEDAR RIM, WAS FOUND ~8 KM DOWNWIND IN 2010 (HEIDEL  ET AL. 2011). THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO KNOWN POPULATIONS OF DESERT YELLOWHEAD IN THE WORLD.  CONTINUING TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE ON THE REPRODUCTION OF DESERT YELLOWHEAD WOULD  PROVIDE A MUCH BETTER DEPICTION OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE POPULATIONS TO FURTHER PROTECT THIS  THREATENED PLANT. A PRACTICAL AND INFORMATIVE MONITORING SCHEME WILL ALSO APPRISE THE BLM OF  WHAT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO CONSERVE THIS RARE SPECIES. CONTINUING TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE ON THE REPRODUCTION OF DESERT YELLOWHEAD WOULD  PROVIDE A MUCH BETTER DEPICTION OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE POPULATIONS TO FURTHER PROTECT THIS RARE  SPECIES.
