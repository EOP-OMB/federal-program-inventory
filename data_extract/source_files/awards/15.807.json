EARTHQUAKE GROUND SHAKING INTENSITY VARIES SPATIALLY DUE TO COMPLEXITIES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH S CRUST. SOME PORTIONS OF A FAULT MAY SLIP MORE THAN OTHERS, THEREBY RELEASING MORE ENERGY AND CAUSING  HOTSPOTS  OF LOCALLY INTENSE SHAKING.

THE 2015 INTERMOUNTAIN WEST WORKSHOP IDENTIFIED THE LOST RIVER FAULT AS THE TOP OF FIVE FAULTS OF CONCERN FOR IDAHO BASED ON THE HAZARD, THE RISK POSED TO NEARBY POPULATIONS, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR NEW SCIENCE. THE LOST RIVER FAULT IS CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS DUE TO ITS QUATERNARY SLIP RATE OF   0.2 TO 0.3 MM YR AND THE 2.6 M PEAK VERTICAL DISPLACEMENT AT THE EARTH S SURFACE IN THE 1983 EARTHQUAKE. IDAHO NATIONAL LABS IS A CRITICAL NATIONAL FACILITY AS THE NATION S LEADER IN NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND IS LOCATED 140 KM FROM THE 1983 RUPTURE. THE NEW AVAILABILITY OF HIGH RESOLUTION TOPOGRAPHY DATA FROM BEFORE AND AFTER THE M6.9 1983 BORAH PEAK EARTHQUAKE PRESENTS A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY NEW GEODETIC TECHNIQUES TO RESOLVE THE COSEISMIC DEFORMATION FIELD AND GAIN A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF FAULT BEHAVIOR IN THE EARTH S CRUST. THE RESEARCHERS WILL RESOLVE THE NEAR  AND FAR FIELD VERTICAL COSEISMIC DEFORMATION FIELD AND SOLVE FOR THE DISTRIBUTED FAULT SLIP THROUGHOUT THE SEISMOGENIC ZONE FOR THE 1983 BORAH PEAK EARTHQUAKE. THE RESEARCHERS WILL PERFORM VERTICAL DIFFERENCING AT THE METER SCALE BASED ON TOPOGRAPHY MEASURED FROM PRE EARTHQUAKE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND POST EARTHQUAKE LIDAR TOPOGRAPHY COLLECTED IN 2020 THROUGH THE USGS S 3D ELEVATION PROGRAM. BECAUSE THE EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED BEFORE THE COLLECTION OF MODERN GEODETIC DATASETS, THE PROCESSING WILL BE CHALLENGING, AND THE RESEARCHERS WILL EXPLORE METHODS TO IMPROVE THE GEOREFERENCING AND REMOVE VEGETATION. FOR THE EARTHQUAKE SOURCE INVERSION, THE FAULT PLANE WILL SPAN THE THOUSAND SPRING AND WARM SPRING FAULT SEGMENTS AS WELL AS THE TRANS BASIN WILLOW CREEK HILLS. THE RESEARCHERS WILL EXPLORE SEVERAL FAULT GEOMETRIES INCLUDING A PLANAR AND LISTRIC FAULT.

ITS ACCURACY DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF SENSORS AVAILABLE NEAR THE EARTHQUAKE BEING WARNED ABOUT.  INCREASING SENSOR DENSITY IS EXPENSIVE FOR CONVENTIONAL INSTRUMENTATION, SO THIS PROJECT LOOKS INTO  A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT TURN PRE EXISTING FIBER OPTIC CABLES INTO SEISMIC SENSORS. THESE ARE THE SAME  CABLES THAT PROVIDE HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO OUR COMMUNITIES. THE FIBER SENSING TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN  USED FOR MANY DIFFERENT RESEARCH APPLICATIONS, BUT NOT FOR EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING YET, BECAUSE  OF CHALLENGES IN CALIBRATING THE MEASURED AMPLITUDES. IN THIS PROJECT, THE FIRST STEP WILL BE TAKEN TO  CALIBRATE THE FIBER SENSING AMPLITUDES, SO THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO EARTHQUAKE  EARLY WARNING IN THE FUTURE.

BECAUSE IT IS NOT KNOWN AHEAD OF TIME WHEN EARTHQUAKES  ARE GOING TO HAPPEN, EARTHQUAKE CATALOGS MUST BE DEVELOPED BY ANALYZING GROUND MOTION AT ALL  TIMES. THIS IS DONE BY SEARCHING SEISMOMETER OUTPUT OF GROUND MOTION FOR POSSIBLE SEISMIC WAVES.  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, MACHINE LEARNING HAS PROVEN TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD AT FINDING  SUCH SEISMIC WAVE ARRIVALS  HOWEVER, IT S NOT ENOUGH TO FIND WAVE ARRIVALS BECAUSE WE DON T KNOW  AHEAD OF TIME HOW MANY EARTHQUAKES ARE GENERATING THEM, AND IT IS NOT KNOWN WHERE THOSE  EARTHQUAKES ARE LOCATED. THE PROBLEM IS COMPLICATED BY NOISE IN THE DATA, SUCH AS AUTOMOBILE  TRAFFIC, THAT CAN FOOL ANY MEASUREMENT SYSTEM INTO THINKING A SEISMIC WAVE HAS BEEN RECORDED FROM  AN EARTHQUAKE.

NEW ANALYSIS THAT CAN RAPIDLY AND RELIABLY CHARACTERIZE INDUCED SEISMICITY ARE  REQUIRED TO EVALUATE THE EARTHQUAKE HAZARD POTENTIAL OF THE REGION AND ASSESS WHETHER THESE  EVENTS ARE FORESHOCKS OF EVEN LARGER EARTHQUAKES. THE MAGNITUDE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION (MFD)  OF EARTHQUAKES IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO DETERMINING EARTHQUAKE RECURRENCE TIMES AND SEISMIC  HAZARDS. UNDERSTANDING HOW THE MFDS CHANGE SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY CAN PROVIDE VITAL  INFORMATION ABOUT VARIATIONS IN THE SEISMIC HAZARD FOR A GIVEN REGION  HOWEVER, THE ESTIMATION OF  THE MFDS OF SMALL INDUCED EARTHQUAKES SUFFERS FROM THE UNCERTAINTIES IN EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDES,  WHICH ARE USUALLY LARGE FOR SMALL EVENTS.

THE CRUSTAL EARTHQUAKES ON THE ISLAND OF  HAWAII ORIGINATE FROM VOLCANIC ACTIVITY AND INCLUDE BOTH SWARMS OF SMALL-MAGNITUDE VOLCANIC  EVENTS AND LARGER TECTONIC EVENTS. GROUND MOTION MODELING ON THE ISLAND OF HAWAII IS CHALLENGING  DUE TO THE DEPTH DISTRIBUTION OF EVENTS AND DIFFERENT ANELASTIC ATTENUATION CHARACTERISTICS.

THESE ARE OBTAINED WITH THE USE OF  MACROSEISMIC INTENSITY, WHICH DESCRIBES THE DEGREE OF GROUND SHAKING USING DIFFERENT MEASURES,  INCLUDING THE EXTENT OF THE BUILDING DAMAGE. MACROSEISMIC INTENSITY IS ALSO USED WITHIN U.S.  GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (USGS) SHAKEALERT EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING (EEW) SYSTEM.  MACROSEISMIC INTENSITY IS ASSIGNED USING MACROSEISMIC SCALES THAT DESCRIBE OBSERVATIONS AT  DIFFERENT INTENSITY LEVELS (USUALLY I TO XII) BASED ON EARTHQUAKE EFFECTS ON PEOPLE, OBJECTS,  BUILDINGS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE MODIFIED MERCALLI INTENSITY (MMI) SCALE IS MOST COMMONLY  USED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE USGS \"DID YOU FEEL IT\" (DYFI) SYSTEM RELIES ON RAPIDLY  COLLECTING MACROSEISMIC INTENSITY DATA FROM INTERNET USERS' SHAKING AND DAMAGE REPORTS FOR  GENERATING INTENSITY MAPS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING FELT EARTHQUAKES. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN IN  OPERATION FOR OVER TWO DECADES, AND OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS, SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL SEISMOLOGICAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR ALGORITHMS. HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH HAS A KNOWN  LIMITATION: IT IS INADEQUATE FOR ASSIGNING INTENSITY VALUES GREATER THAN VIII WHEN SIGNIFICANT  BUILDING DAMAGE OCCURS. ABOVE THIS INTENSITY, ROBUST INTENSITY ASSIGNMENTS REQUIRE ENGINEERING  KNOWLEDGE OF BUILDING TYPE AND DAMAGE LEVELS, SUCH AS ENGINEERING OR PRESS REPORTS AND FIELD  RECONNAISSANCE. WITH THE NEED TO HAVE SEISMOLOGISTS AND ENGINEERS REVIEW THE HIGHER INTENSITY  ASSIGNMENTS, THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO AUTOMATICALLY EVALUATE AND ASSIGN HIGHER SHAKING INTENSITIES  HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY SOLVED. THE EUROPEAN MACROSEISMIC SCALE (EMS-98, GRUNTHAL, 1998) PROVIDES DETAILED GUIDELINES ON  ASSIGNING INTENSITIES ABOVE VIII AND HAS BEEN IN USE FOR OVER 15 YEARS. HOWEVER, EMS-98 IS NOT  APPLICABLE IN THE UNITED STATES (AND NEW ZEALAND, AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES) BECAUSE DOMESTIC  STRUCTURE TYPES ARE NOT REPRESENTED IN THE DAMAGE MATRICES THAT FORM THE BASIS OF THE METHOD. THIS  LIMITATION ALSO INHIBITS IMPLEMENTATION OF A GLOBALLY APPLICABLE MACROSEISMIC INTENSITY SCALE. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP NECESSARY EXTENSIONS TO EMS-98 METHODOLOGY FOR USE WITH THE U.S.  BUILDING STOCK. THE WORK WILL INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THE COMMON BUILDING TYPES IN THE U.S. AND ASSIGNMENT OF EACH TO A VULNERABILITY CLASS; A REVIEW OF THE INTENSITY DEFINITIONS IN EMS-98;  DEFINITIONS OF DAMAGE GRADES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE STRUCTURE TYPES IDENTIFIED; AND AN  EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED INTENSITY LEVELS AGAINST INTENSITY LEVELS ASSIGNED BY EXISTING METHODS FOR PAST EARTHQUAKE EVENTS. THE WORK WILL ALSO INCLUDE EXTENSION OF THE EMS-98 METHODOLOGY FOR  USE WITH THE NEW ZEALAND BUILDING STOCK TO BENEFIT FROM THE SIMILARITIES IN STRUCTURE TYPES, AS WELL  AS AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTED DAMAGE INFORMATION IN THIS COUNTRY FROM RECENT EARTHQUAKES. THE PROJECT RESULTS, IMPLEMENTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH EXISTING EMS-98 GUIDANCE, WILL ALLOW  ASSIGNMENT OF MACROSEISMIC INTENSITIES FOR MODERATE-TO-LARGE EARTHQUAKES IN THE UNITED STATES AND  NEW ZEALAND, CONSISTENT WITH INFORMATION COLLECTED IN EUROPE FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. THE PROJECT  FINDINGS WILL BE DOCUMENTED IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO ENABLE ASSIGNING A  RELIABLE INTENSITY LEVEL FOR THE AREA OF INTEREST.

THE CCSZ  IS INCLUDED IN THE EXISTING STATE-WIDE SEISMIC SOURCE MODEL (UNIFORM CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE RUPTURE  FORECAST - UCERF3) AND REPRESENTS A POTENTIAL HAZARD TO LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

THE STATEWIDE MODELS INCLUDE THE CCSZ AS A PARTICIPANT FAULT IN RUPTURES INVOLVING THE WEST  NAPA FAULT TO THE NORTH, AND THE NORTHERN CALAVERAS FAULT TO THE SOUTH. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO TEST THIS  MODEL OF POTENTIAL FAULT CONNECTIVITY WITH THE COLLECTION OF SEISMOTECTONIC AND PALEOSEISMIC DATA ON THE  LAFAYETTE FAULT AND CCFZ.

YET THEY REST ON MANY UNCERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, AND THIS IS INCREASING FURTHER AS MODELS COME TO INCORPORATE MORE FEATURES AND BECOME MORE COMPLEX. EXACERBATING THE ISSUE IS THE DIFFICULTY IN TESTING THE MODELS, DUE TO THE LONG RECURRENCE TIMES OF LARGE EARTHQUAKES, THE EVENTS MOST CRITICAL FOR LONG TERM HAZARD ESTIMATES. QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN OF WHETHER THIS PATHWAY TOWARDS FURTHER REFINEMENT OF HAZARD MODELS INVOLVING FURTHER PIECES WITH FURTHER PARAMETERIZATIONS HAS REACHED ITS LIMIT, OR WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE OTHER WAYS TO FORGE AHEAD. ONE ALTERNATIVE NOTED IN PLANNING FOR NEXT GENERATION HAZARD MODEL IS THE POTENTIAL FOR PHYSICS-BASED EARTHQUAKE SIMULATORS TO CONTRIBUTE [FIELD, 2018]. THEY BRING A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES WHICH COULD BE USEFUL, INCLUDING SELF-CONSISTENCY WITH A GIVEN SPECIFIED PHYSICS, AND NATURALLY ACCOMPLISHING MANY OF THE BOOKKEEPING FEATURES STATISTICAL MODELS HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO REPRESENT, INCLUDING MULTIFAULT RUPTURES, ELASTIC REBOUND, COULOMB STRESS COMPATIBILITY, AND SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS, AMONG OTHERS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SIMULATORS THEMSELVES HAVE THEIR OWN UNCERTAINTIES. WILL THE ARRAY OF UNCERTAINTIES THE SIMULATORS FACE, RATHER THAN HELPING TO NARROW UNCERTAINTIES IN HAZARD ESTIMATES, ONLY EXPAND THE UNCERTAINTIES? RECENT MAJOR PROGRESS HAS CHANGED THIS PICTURE DRAMATICALLY. PUSHING AHEAD WITH PHYSICSBASED SIMULATOR DEVELOPMENT AND COMPARISONS WITH THE LATEST HAZARD MODEL FOR CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE FOUND IMPRESSIVE AGREEMENT OF LONG TERM FAULT BASED HAZARD ESTIMATES ACROSS CALIFORNIA [SHAW, ET AL, 2018]. THIS ABILITY TO REPLICATE HAZARD ESTIMATES IS IMPORTANT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. ONE, IT ADDS STRONGLY INCREASED CONFIDENCE TO HAZARD ESTIMATES THROUGH A TRIANGULATION FORM OF REPLICATION BY VASTLY DIFFERENT METHODS. GIVEN THE PROLIFERATING UNCERTAINTIES IN THE STATISTICALLY BASED EARTHQAUAKE HAZARD MODELS, THIS IS OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE. IT ALSO GIVES US A NEW PATHWAY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND REFINE AND EXAMINE ROBUSTNESS AND UNCERTAINTY QUESTIONS IN THE HAZARD ESTIMATES. BY HAVING A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO APPROACHES, ONE PHYSICS-BASED, ONE STATISTICALLYBASED, BOTH ARE STRENGTHENED AND IMPROVED. THIS WORK CONTINUES TO PUSH FORWARD THIS DIALOGUE AND COLLABORATION WHICH CAN INFORM AND SUPPORT NEXT GENERATION SEISMIC HAZARD MODELS. THE TOPIC OF THE WORK IS IMPROVING SEGMENTATION CONSTRAINTS, WHICH IMPACTS MULTIFAULT PROBABILITIES AND THE SIZES OF RUPTURES ON FAULT SYSTEMS.

FUTURE LARGE EARTHQUAKES OFFSHORE ALASKA HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR GENERATING LARGE TSUNAMI  THAT CAN PROPAGATE ACROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND THREATEN COASTAL COMMUNITIES ALONG THE PACIFIC  RIM, AS WELL AS PACIFIC ISLANDS SUCH AS HAWAII. THE LARGEST TSUNAMI ARE GENERATED BY LARGE  EARTHQUAKES ALONG SUBDUCTION ZONES. THESE LARGE EARTHQUAKES RELEASE ENERGY THAT IS ACCUMULATED  BETWEEN MOVING TECTONIC PLATES. AS THE PLATES SUDDENLY SLIDE PAST ONE ANOTHER DURING AN EARTHQUAKE, THE SEAFLOOR IS WARPED, WHICH IN TURN DISPLACES THE OCEAN AND INITIATES A TSUNAMI.  EARTHQUAKES THAT RUPTURE THE SHALLOW CRUST HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE THE LARGEST TSUNAMI.  THUS IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS SHALLOW FAULT SLIP.  OUR STUDY WILL EXAMINE THE AMOUNT AND DEPTH OF FAULT SLIP DURING THE 2020 SIMEONOF EARTHQUAKE (MAGNITUDE 7.8) AND EVALUATE WHETHER SIGNIFICANT SHALLOW FAULT SLIP COULD OCCUR FOR A FUTURE  EARTHQUAKE AT THIS LOCATION ALONG THE ALASKA-ALEUTIAN SUBDUCTION ZONE. THIS EARTHQUAKE IS THE  FIRST OF THREE LARGE EARTHQUAKES NEAR THIS LOCATION IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. THUS THIS SEGMENT OF THE  SUBDUCTION ZONE HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE. THE SIMEONOF EARTHQUAKE IS ALSO ADJACENT TO A FAULT  SEGMENT THAT HAS NOT EXPERIENCED A LARGE EARTHQUAKE IN NEARLY 100 YEARS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO  DISCERN THE SPECIFIC AREA ALONG THE SUBDUCTION ZONE THAT RUPTURED DURING THE SIMEONOF EARTHQUAKE  SINCE THAT WILL HELP US TO UNDERSTAND WHERE LARGE EARTHQUAKES MAY STILL OCCUR IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

FRICTIONAL  RESISTANCE OF THE FAULT - ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS CONTROLLING EARTHQUAKE NUCLEATION, DYNAMIC  PROPAGATION, AND ARREST, AND HENCE THE DESTRUCTIVE GROUND SHAKING OF EARTHQUAKES - HAS MOSTLY BEEN  STUDIED IN EXPERIMENTS WITH UNIFORM SLIP IMPOSED IN RELATIVELY SMALL SAMPLES.WITH PRIOR USGS SUPPORT, WE HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS THAT FEATURE  SPONTANEOUSLY DEVELOPING SEQUENCES OF DYNAMIC RUPTURES AND SLOWER SLIP IN FINE ROCK GOUGE AS  FOUND IN CORES OF MATURE FAULTS; THE RUPTURES ARE RESOLVED IN SPACE AND TIME BY RECENTLY DEVELOPED  HIGH-SPEED DIAGNOSTICS.WE PROPOSE TO FURTHER DEVELOP, ANALYZE, AND NUMERICALLY SIMULATE THE EXPERIMENTS FEATURING  SPONTANEOUS SEQUENCES OF DYNAMIC EVENTS AND DYNAMIC RUPTURE TRIGGERING ALONG ROCK-GOUGE  INTERFACES. (I) WE WILL IMPROVE OUR HYBRID LABORATORY SAMPLES AND PROCEDURES THAT COMBINE A BULK  ANALOG MATERIAL (HOMALITE) WITH ROCK GOUGE ON THE INTERFACE. THE HYBRID SAMPLES ALLOW US TO RETAIN  THE ADVANTAGE IN REDUCED NUCLEATION SIZES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANALOG MATERIAL, WHILE ENABLING US  TO STUDY DYNAMIC RUPTURE PHENOMENA ON ROCK-GOUGE INTERFACES AS WELL AS TO INTERROGATE THE  EVOLVING DYNAMIC FRICTION OF ROCK GOUGE FOR SLIP RATES CHARACTERISTIC OF DYNAMIC RUPTURE. WE WILL  CONDUCT THE EXPERIMENTS UNDER DIFFERENT RESOLVED PRE-STRESS CONDITIONS; WITH DIFFERENT GOUGE GRAIN  SIZES; WITH REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO RUPTURE THE ROCK-GOUGE PORTION; AND WITH DIFFERENT TIME DELAYS TO  STUDY THE EFFECT OF HEALING.  (II) WE WILL USE OUR EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY HOW DYNAMIC RUPTURE BREAKS THROUGH INITIALLY  UNFAVORABLE, BARRIER-LIKE FAULT REGIONS. OUR RESULTS SO FAR INDICATE THAT THE GOUGE-FILLED INTERFACE  INITIALLY BEHAVES AS A BARRIER TO DYNAMIC RUPTURE, STOPPING DYNAMIC RUPTURE ORIGINATING ON RUPTUREPRONE HOMALITE INTERFACES, CONSISTENT WITH INITIALLY VELOCITY-STRENGTHENING FRICTION OF ROCK GOUGE.  HOWEVER, SLOWER SLIP LINGERS ON THE INTERFACE BETWEEN CLEAR DYNAMIC RUPTURES, WHICH MAKES THE  ROCK-GOUGE INTERFACE PRONE TO LOCALIZATION, DYNAMIC WEAKENING, AND DYNAMIC TRIGGERING. WE WILL  CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS WITH REPEATING RUPTURES ATTEMPTING TO PENETRATE THE SAME GOUGE-FILLED  INTERFACE TO STUDY THESE PHENOMENA IN MORE DETAIL. THE EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS WILL INVESTIGATE THE  PLAUSIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT THAT DYNAMIC WEAKENING, COMBINED WITH DYNAMIC TRIGGERING, MAY  ENABLE EARTHQUAKE RUPTURE TO BREAK THROUGH STABLE, CREEPING FAULT REGIONS, WITH SIGNIFICANT  IMPLICATIONS FOR SEISMIC HAZARD.  (III) WE WILL NUMERICALLY SIMULATE THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS USING FRICTION FORMULATIONS THAT  COMBINE STANDARD RATE-AND-STATE FRICTION AT LOW SLIP RATES WITH FLASH HEATING AT HIGH SLIP RATES. IN  THE PROCESS, WE WILL DETERMINE THE CORRESPONDING FRICTION PARAMETERS OF THE ROCK GOUGE AND HOW  THEY EVOLVE DURING THE SEQUENCE OF DYNAMIC RUPTURES. THE MODELING MAY REVEAL THAT ADDITIONAL  PHYSICAL PROCESSES ARE NEEDED TO CAPTURE THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. (IV) ADDITIONAL FRICTION EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED ON HOMALITE AND ROCK GOUGE SAMPLES IN THE  DIRECT-DOUBLE-SHEAR (DDS) SETUP AT USGS MENLO PARK; SUCH EXPERIMENTS ON ROCKS HAVE BEEN  PREVIOUSLY ANALYZED AND COMPARED WITH NATURAL EARTHQUAKES.
