THE DEMAND FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING FOR FISH SPECIES IS INCREASING AND CAHFS IS CURRENTLY BUILDING CAPACITY TO ENHANCE THE FISH AND AQUACULTURE TESTING THAT CAN BE OFFERED. AMONG THE MAJOR AREAS OF INTEREST ARE CORRECT IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIAL ORGANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH FISH DISEASE, AS WELL AS ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING (AST), OR DETECTION OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE GENES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO IN VITRO AST, GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WITH GROWTH OF MOST FISH PATHOGENS UNDER ROUTINE CULTURE CONDITIONS AND THE GENERAL LACK OF CLINICAL BREAKPOINTS AND LABORATORY STANDARDS FOR PERFORMING AST IN FISH. CAHFS HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED CAPACITY BUILDING FUNDING AND IS APPLYING FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GROW OUR FISH DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM, INCLUDING BACTERIAL WGS SEQUENCING CAPABILITY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CUSTOM FISH PATHOGEN MALDI-TOF LIBRARY TO ENHANCE RAPID AND ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF FISH BACTERIAL ORGANISMS FROM CLINICAL SAMPLES, AND GENOMIC AMR SURVEILLANCE. FURTHERMORE, WITH THE CAPACITY TO PERFORM WGS ON MICROBIAL PATHOGENS, CAHFS WOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANIMAL AND FOOD PATHOGEN SEQUENCING EFFORTS AND PARTICIPATE IN VET-LIRN PROGRAMS.

VARIANTS OF CONCERN (VOC) HAVE EMERGED THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC (CDC, 2021A). AMONG THE RECENT OF THESE ARE DELTA, WHICH HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PATHOGENICITY, AND OMICRON AND ITS CURRENTLY CIRCULATING SUBTYPES, WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED TRANSMISSIBILITY (CDC, 2021A). ALTHOUGH HUMANS HAVE SERVED AS THE PRIMARY SARS-COV-2 RESERVOIR, NATURAL INFECTIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN ANIMALS (SINGLA ET AL., 2020), MOSTLY EITHER COMPANION ANIMALS, INCLUDING CATS AND DOGS, OR OTHER ANIMALS UNDER HUMAN CARE, INCLUDING TIGERS, LIONS, GORILLAS, SNOW LEOPARDS, OTTERS AND SPOTTED HYENAS (USDA-APHIS). FROM AUGUST 2021 TO PRESENT, ALL CONFIRMED CASES OF SARS-COV-2 IN COMPANION AND EXOTICS SPECIES IN THE U.S HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER DELTA OR OMICRON, WHICH ALSO CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A MAJORITY OF OVERALL INFECTIONS IN THESE ANIMAL POPULATIONS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC (USDA-APHIS). ACCURATE DETECTION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF MAJOR VOCS IS IMPORTANT FOR SURVEILLANCE OF SARS-COV-2 IN THESE ANIMAL POPULATIONS, AND CAN SERVE AS A USEFUL TOOL FOR RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES THAT MAY HELP DETERMINE THE ROLES THESE SPECIES PLAYED DURING THE PANDEMIC.

DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS ADVANCES IN NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS) TECHNOLOGIES HAVE ENHANCED THE CAPABILITIES OF VIRAL SEQUENCING. HOWEVER, NGS IS EXPENSIVE AND REQUIRES ADVANCED EQUIPMENT AND BIOINFORMATICS EXPERTISE. FOR THOSE REASONS, ITS ADOPTION AS A ROUTINE DIAGNOSTIC SERVICE AT VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORIES (VDLS) HAS BEEN SLOW. AN ADDITIONAL COMPLICATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NGS IN VDLS IS THE VARIETY OF PLATFORMS AVAILABLE, AND THE LACK OF PRACTICAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO A LABORATORY TO SELECT THE RIGHT PLATFORM. SOME PLATFORMS CAN BE LESS EXPENSIVE UPFRONT BUT REQUIRE A LARGER EXPENSE IN SUPPLIES PER SAMPLE. OTHER PLATFORMS MAY BE AN INEXPENSIVE OPTION, BUT ARE NOT WELL SUITED TO RUN MULTIPLE SAMPLES AT A TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME PLATFORMS MAY REQUIRE MORE LABOR THAN OTHERS. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS PROBABLY NOT A SINGLE PLATFORM OR A SINGLE PROTOCOL THAT SUITS EACH VDL. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF STUDIES BEING PUBLISHED EVERY WEEK ON NGS. HOWEVER, THEY ARE MAINLY RESEARCH PAPERS, WITH RESULTS THAT CANNOT BE READILY APPLIED TO ROUTINE DIAGNOSTICS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR STUDIES THAT PROVIDE PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF NGS TECHNOLOGIES IN ROUTINE VETERINARY DIAGNOSTICS. THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA VDL IS WELL POSITIONED TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. OUR CURRENT NGS SECTION HAS ACCESS TO MULTIPLE SEQUENCING PLATFORMS, AS WELL AS EXPERTISE IN MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS AND BIOINFORMATICS.

A FEW MAJOR SARS-COV-2 VARIANTS OF CONCERN (VOC) HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED TRANSMISSIBILITY IN HUMANS, INCLUDING THE UK VARIANT B.1.1.7/ALPHA, SOUTH AFRICA VARIANT B.1.351/BETA, JAPAN/BRAZIL VARIANT P.1/GAMMA, CALIFORNIA VARIANTS B.1.427/B.1.429/EPSILON, AND INDIA VARIANTS B.1.6.7.1/B.1.6.7.2/DELTA (CDC, 2021A). SARS-COV-2 HAS ALSO BEEN FOUND IN DIFFERENT ANIMAL SPECIES, INCLUDING DOGS, CATS, TIGERS, LIONS, MINKS, FERRETS ETC. TRANSMISSION AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITHIN AN ANIMAL SPECIES HAS BEEN REPORTED (HALFMANN ET AL, 2020; OIE, 2021), AS WELL AS LIMITED REPORTS OF ANIMAL TO HUMAN TRANSMISSION (HEDMAN ET AL., 2021), YET MORE EXTENSIVE STUDIES MAY BE NEEDED TO DRAW A CONCLUSION. BOTH FLU A AND FLU B ARE MAJOR HUMAN AND ANIMAL RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS, AND CAUSE SYMPTOMS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM COVID-19.

IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT PEOPLE WITH COVID-19 FREQUENTLY PASS SARS-COV-2 ON TO THEIR PETS. CATS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SARS-COV-2 THAN DOGS, AND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT BOTH SPECIES CAN DEVELOP COVID-19 AFTER A NATURAL OR EXPERIMENTAL EXPOSURE. THE CLINICAL SIGNS OF COVID-19 IN CATS AND DOGS INCLUDE RESPIRATORY SIGNS AND DIARRHEA, WHICH MUST BE DIFFERENTIATED FROM FELINE RESPIRATORY DISEASE COMPLEX (FRDC), CANINE INFECTIOUS RESPIRATORY DISEASE COMPLEX (CIRDC OR COMMONLY KNOWN AS \u201cKENNEL COUGH\u201d), AND DIARRHEA CAUSED BY OTHER VIRUSES, BACTERIAL AND PARASITES. THUS, RAPID DETECTION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF SARS-COV-2 FROM OTHER COMMON VIRAL AND BACTERIAL AGENTS IN A SINGLE SPECIMEN IS CRITICAL IN CONTROLLING COVID-19 AND IMPLEMENTING APPROPRIATE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES.

FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS, THE MU VMDL\u2019S DIAGNOSTIC TOXICOLOGY AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY SECTION (DTACS) HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL ANALYTICAL SUPPORT TO DETECT A VARIETY OF POTENTIAL TOXICANTS, ESPECIALLY AFLATOXINS AND ERGOPEPTINE ALKALOIDS THAT CONTAMINATE LIVESTOCK FEEDS AND PET FOODS. BECAUSE THESE AND OTHER FOOD CONTAMINANTS CAN NOT ONLY HARM ANIMALS BUT CAN ALSO RESULT IN THE PRESENCE OF CONTAMINANT RESIDUES IN FOODSTUFFS INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, THE FOOD CONTAMINANT SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES OF VET-LIRN MUST BE SENSITIVE, ACCURATE, RAPID, AND COST-EFFECTIVE.

MANY INFECTIONS IN CATS ARE ASYMPTOMATIC, AND THERE ARE ONLY A FEW ONGOING SURVEILLANCE STUDIES IN COMPANION ANIMALS, SO THE NUMBER OF CASES IN CATS IS LIKELY HIGHER. CATS ARE INFECTED BY SARS-COV-2 FROM THEIR HUMAN OWNERS BUT HAVE BEEN SHOWN EXPERIMENTALLY TO TRANSMIT THE VIRUS CAT-TO-CAT. ONCE INFECTED, AT LEAST EXPERIMENTALLY, THE VIRUS QUICKLY ADAPTS IN CATS THROUGH GENETIC DRIFT AND POSITIVE SELECTION AT IMPORTANT RESIDUES WITHIN THE SPIKE PROTEIN, A PROTEIN USED FOR CELLULAR ATTACHMENT. THESE ADAPTED VIRUSES ARE THEN SPREAD TO ADDITIONAL CATS AND MAINTAINED WITHIN THE GROUP. THIS CAN LEAD TO ACCELERATED FIXATION OF POTENTIALLY CONCERNING VARIANTS FOR THE HUMAN POPULATION IF THE VIRUS IS THEN ABLE TO RE-INFECT HUMANS. ADDITIONALLY, CATS MAY SERVE AS A MEANS FOR INTRODUCING VARIANT VIRUSES INTO WILDLIFE POPULATIONS BASED ON THEIR HUNTING BEHAVIOR. THEREFORE, SURVEILLANCE OF CATS FOR SARS-COV-2 IS WARRANTED BASED ON THESE CONSIDERATIONS. TARGETED SURVEILLANCE SHOULD INVOLVE THE INTERFACE OF HUMANS AND ANIMALS, AS THIS IS MOST LIKELY WHERE THESE EVENTS WILL OCCUR (INFECTION OF ANIMALS FROM HUMANS WITH A POTENTIAL OF SPILLBACK TO HUMANS FROM ANIMALS). PET CATS IN POSITIVE SARS-COV-2 HOUSEHOLDS ARE ALREADY KNOWN TO BE AT RISK FOR INFECTION AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN A TARGETED ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM INVOLVING DOMESTIC CATS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME CATS SHOW RESPIRATORY SIGNS WHEN INFECTED WITH SARS-COV-2, SO THE INCLUSION OF SARS-COV-2 TESTING, ALONG WITH TESTING FOR THE MORE LIKELY PATHOGENS THAT PRODUCE RESPIRATORY DISEASE IN CATS, ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL PASSIVE SURVEILLANCE. CATS SUBMITTED TO DIAGNOSTIC LABS FOR NECROPSIES CAN ALSO EASILY BE INCLUDED IN A SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. TO ADDRESS SURVEILLANCE NEEDS, THE PURDUE ANIMAL DISEASE DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY PROPOSES TO ADD SARS-COV-2 PRIMER SETS TO THE TARGETED NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING PANEL FOR DETECTION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF DOGS AND CATS. THE AMENDED PANEL WILL BE VALIDATED FOR THE DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2 BY USING A SET OF SEQUENCED POSITIVE SAMPLES, WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE CURRENT SARS-COV-2 VARIANTS OF INTEREST AND CONCERN, AS DEFINED BY THE CDC. ADDITIONALLY, NASAL AND OROPHARYNGEAL SWABS WILL BE COLLECTED FROM CATS FOR SURVEILLANCE TESTING BASED ON THE ABOVE CRITERIA. THESE SAMPLES WILL BE TESTED BY BOTH AN APPROVED RT-PCR FOR SARS-COV-2 AND THE TARGETED NGS PANEL TO DETERMINE THE DIAGNOSTIC SENSITIVITY/SPECIFICITY OF THE PANEL FOR DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2. ADDITIONALLY, ANY POSITIVE SAMPLES WE OBTAIN FROM THE CATS WILL BE SEQUENCED TO EVALUATE VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH INFECTION. ADDITION OF THIS VIRUS TO COMMONLY USED PANELS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES WILL ALLOW FOR CONTINUED PASSIVE SURVEILLANCE WITHOUT THE NEED TO SPECIFICALLY REQUEST AND OBTAIN APPROVAL FOR THE TESTING. THIS SHOULD ENHANCE OUR DETECTION OF THIS VIRUS IN CATS, POTENTIALLY PREVENTING THE UNWANTED INTRODUCTION OR SPREAD INTO NEW POPULATIONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IN", "COVID-19 Obligations": 77500.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3d0e924f-2881-5f66-8511-7122b17340d9-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U18FD007495_7524"}, {"internal_id": 140658757, "Award ID": "U18FD007493", "Award Amount": 24602.96, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-20", "CFDA Number": "93.103", "Description": "COVID-19 - VET-LIRN NETWORK CAPACITY BUILDING FOR SARS-COV-2: -80 DEGREE FREEZER ANDNANODROP - PROJECT ABSTRACT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS (UI) VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY (VDL) IS A FULL SERVICE, AAVLD ACCREDITED, ALL SPECIES, REFERENCE LABORATORY.

MILLIONS OF LIVES EVERY YEAR, THE RISE OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT BACTERIAL STRAINS POSES AN INCREASING THREAT TO BOTH HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH. WITH GROWING EVIDENCE THAT RESISTANT BACTERIA IN COMPANION ANIMALS (PETS) IS CORRELATED WITH RESISTANT BACTERIA IN THEIR OWNERS, JUDICIOUS USE OF ANTIMICROBIALS BY HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IS CRITICAL TO LIMIT THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANT PATHOGENS(1) SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SPECIFICALLY CALLED ON THE VETERINARY PROFESSION TO PARTICIPATE IN ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP AND HAVE SUGGESTED STRATEGIES ON HOW TO DO SO(2,3) BECAUSE THE REDUCTION OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE IN BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM COMPANION ANIMALS IS A GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN.  THE EMERGENCE OF CARBAPENEM RESISTANT ENTEROBACTERIACEAE (CRE) IN COMPANION ANIMAL VETERINARY MEDICINE WAS INEVITABLE \u2013 AND YET WE WERE, AND ARE, COMPLETELY UNPREPARED. IN APRIL 2019, PASSIVE SURVEILLANCE CONDUCTED BY VET-LIRN IDENTIFIED THE BLANDM-5 GENE IN A CARBAPENEM-RESISTANT E. COLI FROM A DOG THAT WAS A PATIENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA VETERINARY HOSPITAL. VETLIRN HAS CREATED A VETERINARY ANTIMICROBIAL WORKING GROUP (VAWG) TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISOLATION OF THESE ORGANISMS FROM ANIMALS.  CDC HAS DECLARED THE THAT CRE ARE AN URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT. AGGRESSIVE ACTION IS NEEDED TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF CRE FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS, OR VICE VERSA, AND SURVEILLANCE IS NECESSARY TO DETECT RESISTANCE MECHANISMS IN ANIMAL ISOLATES. CDC\u2019S ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE LABORATORY NETWORK (AR LAB NETWORK) SUPPORTS NATIONWIDE LAB CAPACITY TO RAPIDLY DETECT ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE AND INFORM LOCAL RESPONSES TO PREVENT SPREAD AND PROTECT PEOPLE. IT CLOSES THE GAP BETWEEN LOCAL CAPABILITIES AND THE DATA NEEDED TO COMBAT ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE BY PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE LAB CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT PATHOGENS, CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY, AND DATA COLLECTION TO DRIVE RESPONSE AND PREVENT INFECTIONS.  THE FDA VETLIRN MISSION IS: TO PROMOTE HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH BY COLLABORATING WITH VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORIES TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, BUILD LABORATORY CAPACITY FOR ROUTINE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAIN SCIENTISTS. VETLIRN MUST ALSO BE IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE LAB CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT PATHOGENS IN VETERINARY MEDICINE. THAT SHOULD BE DONE USING THE SAME CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS USED IN THE CDC ARLN. A CRE REFERENCE LABORATORY WITHIN THE VETLIRN INFRASTRUCTURE WILL SUPPORT THE COLLECTION OF VETERINARY SURVEILLANCE DATA TO DRIVE VETERINARY-SPECIFIC RESPONSES AND PREVENT INFECTION IN ANIMALS AND

FOR EXAMPLE, THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE DEPLOYED IN FULLY REMOTE AND HYBRID APPROACHES FOR CLINICAL TRIALS WHICH COULD HELP PROMOTING MORE PARTICIPATION AMONG UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS AS WELL AS BY BRIDGING GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE AND REDUCING PARTICIPANT BURDEN (E.G., LESS TRAVEL TIME, MORE FLEXIBILITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY). REMOTE OR ONLINE APPROACHES CAN ALSO INCREASE ACCESS TO CRITICAL SERVICES (E.G., MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED TESTING [STI] PREVENTION) THAT ARE SCARCE OR GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED. HOWEVER, THESE APPROACHES HAVE YET TO BE OPTIMIZED FOR ALL POSSIBLE BENEFICIARIES OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND HEALTHCARE, ESPECIALLY TARGETING UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPERIENCING SOCIAL AND GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION.  GROUPS LIKE ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER (AAPI \u2013 INCLUDING NATIVE HAWAIIAN), AMERICAN INDIAN (AI) AND HISPANIC/LATINO POPULATIONS ARE OFTEN UNDER-REPRESENTED IN CLINICAL TRIALS, SO MUCH SO THAT THEY OFTEN OCCUPY THE RACIAL/ETHNIC CATEGORY OF \u201cOTHER\u201d IN RESEARCH STUDIES.

GIVEN THE SIZE OF THIS INDUSTRY, IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE RAISE AWARENESS OF THE HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THESE TOXIC PRODUCTS. IT IS HIGHLY UNREGULATED, DIFFUSE, AND THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN VENUES FROM HIGH END RETAIL STORES TO COMMUNITY CORNER STORES. PRODUCTS CONTAIN A RANGE OF HARMFUL CHEMICALS INCLUDING MERCURY, HYDROQUINONE, AND STEROIDS, THAT PROMISE TO LIGHTEN SKIN OR REDUCE DARK SPOTS, BUT THESE PRODUCTS CAN HAVE A RANGE OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS INCLUDING ON A PERSON\u2019S REPRODUCTIVE AND NEUROLOGICAL HEALTH. WE ARE ESPECIALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT IT CAN HAVE FOR WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH, NOT ONLY ON THEIR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH BUT ALSO NEGATIVE KIDNEY EFFECTS, NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS, GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MERCURY\u2019S NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACTS. MANY CONSUMERS ARE UNAWARE OF THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OR MISUSE OF THESE PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD HIGHER MERCURY IN THEIR URINE DUE TO USE OF SKIN-LIGHTENING PRODUCTS. WOMEN IN MINNESOTA FROM THE SOMALI COMMUNITY LOST HER VISION DUE TO MERCURY EXPOSURE FROM SKIN-LIGHTING CREAM. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS HUGE HEALTH DISPARITY THAT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WE NEED TO GET SUPPORT TO EXPAND THE CURRENT OUTREACH AND EDUCATION WE ARE DOING TO COMBAT SKIN-LIGHTENING AND CHEMICAL EXPOSURES. THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS IS ALSO DRIVEN BY COLORISM, WHERE SOCIAL AND RACIAL PRESSURES LEAD TO FEELINGS OF INADEQUACY OR INTERNALIZED RACISM. THUS, EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS FOR COMMUNITIES MUST ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THIS ISSUE, CONSIDER HOW TO UPLIFT AND COMMUNICATE MESSAGES OF DIVERSE BEAUTY STANDARDS AND COMMUNITY STRENGTH, WHILE ALSO COMMUNICATING SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH HARMS FROM CHEMICALS. PROJECT ACTIVITIES: WE HAVE LEARNED THAT CULTURAL SPECIFICITY AND TRUST IS CRITICAL TO THIS WORK. COMMUNITIES RECEIVE INFORMATION IN DIVERSE FORMATS-- FROM TRUSTED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS, CULTURAL BROKERS, LOCAL LANGUAGE MEDIA, AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. MOST COMMUNITIES UTILIZING THESE PRODUCTS DO NOT REFER TO PUBLIC HEALTH WEBSITES OR THE FDA WEBSITES. THUS, WE PROPOSE TO PRODUCE CONTENT IN THREE FORMATS-- AN INFOGRAPHIC, SHORT FORM VIDEOS, AND LOCAL LANGUAGE NEWS MEDIA. ALSO, WE WILL BE DEVELOPING AN ANIMATED VIDEO THAT WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO THREE LANGUAGES: SOMALI, SPANISH AND HMONG. BOTH SHORT AND LONGER VIDEOS WE WILL TRANSLATE MESSAGES INTO SEVERAL LANGUAGES.

SOME ARGUE THAT BLACK INDIVIDUALS\u2019 MISTRUST OF CLINICAL TRIALS STEMS FROM THE FEAR THAT MEDICAL RESEARCH WILL CAUSE STERILIZATION, AND THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THIS MISCONCEPTION AND CLINICAL TRIALS IS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL TRAUMA THAT THE BLACK COMMUNITY EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST.

MAFD HAS MORE COMMONLY BEEN USED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY, AND HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED TO DRYING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AT A LARGE SCALE.

IN CONTRAST TO NATIVE NUCLEIC ACIDS, WHICH ARE PREPARED ENZYMATICALLY, SYNTHETIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDE DRUGS ARE PREPARED CHEMICALLY VIA SOLID-PHASE CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS. SOLID-PHASE CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS PROVIDES AN ADVANTAGEOUS PLATFORM FOR INTRODUCING CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS DURING DRUG DEVELOPMENT TO OVERCOME THE POOR PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF NATIVE NUCLEIC ACIDS. A COMMON CHEMICAL MODIFICATION FOR OLIGONUCLEOTIDE DRUGS INVOLVES THE REPLACEMENT OF ONE OXYGEN IN THE NATURAL PHOSPHODIESTER (PO) LINKAGE WITH A SULFUR CREATING A PHOSPHOROTHIOATE (PS) LINKAGE.

THE PS MODIFICATION IS ROUTINELY USED IN ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE (ASO) THERAPEUTICS THAT ARE A PREVALENT PLATFORM FOR DRUG DISCOVERY WITH SEVERAL ASOS GAINING UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) APPROVAL. THE CONSEQUENCE OF CHEMICALLY REPLACING THE PO LINKAGE WITH A PS LINKAGE IS THE CREATION OF A CHIRAL CENTER AT THE PHOSPHOROUS ATOM.

WHILE DISPROPORTIONATE COVID-19 MORTALITIES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY (URM) COMMUNITIES, ENROLLMENT INTO COVID-19 CLINICAL TRIALS HAS BEEN CHALLENGING. SUCH CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH PATIENT, SYSTEM, PROVIDER, AND COMMUNITY BARRIERS, INCLUDING MISTRUST, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, FAILURE TO MEET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, AND LACK OF AWARENESS OF STUDIES. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY (TAMU) HAS PARTNERED WITH THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES OF PHARMACY (AACP). THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO EMPLOY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML), DEVELOP A NATIONAL NETWORK THAT WOULD ENGAGE INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES, AND TO TRAIN AND EDUCATE RESEARCHERS TO ADVANCE COVID-19 HEALTH EQUITY RESEARCH IN URM COMMUNITIES.

THEREFORE, GENERIC DRUGS PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE US HEALTH SYSTEM. A GENERIC DRUG IS APPROVED ON THE BASIS OF SUFFICIENT DEMONSTRATION OF SAMENESS TO THE CORRESPONDING BRAND-NAME DRUG. CRITICAL EVIDENCE FOR APPROVAL IS BIOEQUIVALENCE (BE). EVEN THOUGH WELL ESTABLISHED, PHARMACOKINETIC-BASED BE STUDIES ARE BOTH COSTLY AND LENGTHY. IN THE CASE OF ORALLY ADMINISTERED DRUG PRODUCTS, CO-ADMINISTRATION WITH FOOD MAY INFLUENCE ORAL ABSORPTION, THUS BE SHOULD BE DEMONSTRATED UNDER BOTH FASTING AND FED CONDITIONS IF THE REFERENCE LISTED DRUG LABELING STATES THE PRODUCT CAN BE TAKEN WITH OR WITHOUT MEALS. THIS REQUIREMENT POSES AN ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDEN ON GENERIC MANUFACTURERS, WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE PASSED ALONG TO PATIENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENT OF TWO IN VIVO BE STUDIES SLOWS DOWN THE GENERIC DRUG PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND MAY INCREASE REVIEW CYCLES AND ATTRITION RATES DUE TO VARIABILITY THAT IS RELATED TO THE DRUG ITSELF RATHER THAN THE FORMULATION. QUANTITATIVE METHODS AND MODELING HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED IN THE REALM OF NEW DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT TO INFORM MORE EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. PHYSIOLOGICALLY-BASED PHARMACOKINETIC (PBPK) MODELING IS ONE OF THE KEY TOOLS UNDER THE OVERARCHING UMBRELLA OF QUANTITATIVE MODELS.

NANOHMICS\u2019 METADOT OPTICAL READER IS DESIGNED TO MEASURE PATHOGEN BINDING ON A CUSTOM OPTICAL METASURFACE TEST CHIP COATED WITH AN ARRAY OF BIORECEPTOR REGIONS (DOTS), EACH FUNCTIONALIZED FOR DIRECT COVALENT RECEPTOR BINDING USING AMINATED ANTIBODIES OR DNA APTAMERS. METADOT WILL PROVIDE EASY AND HIGHLY ACCURATE MULTIPLEX DETECTION, IDENTIFICATION, AND QUANTIFICATION OF FOODBORNE PATHOGENS. EACH SINGLE-USE FUNCTIONALIZED BIOSENSOR CHIP IS MOUNTED IN A CUSTOM CASSETTE FOR PRECISE INSERTION INTO THE METADOT READER. WHEN THE BIOSENSOR CHIP IS EXPOSED TO THE RINSATE OR SOLUTION UNDER TEST, THE READER PROBES THE 36 DOT REGIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY USING POLARIZED MONOCHROMATIC LIGHT REFLECTED BY EACH DOT AS A FUNCTION OF THE DENSITY OF LOCAL PATHOGEN BINDING. PHASE II WILL DEMONSTRATE A SIMULTANEOUS TEST FOR LESS THAN $3 FOR 36 DOTS, ENOUGH TO COVER THE 31 MAJOR IDENTIFIED FOODBORNE PATHOGENS. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL DEVELOP AND TEST THE METADOT PROTOTYPE:  RESEARCH AIM 1 ADDRESSES LOW-COST MULTIPLEX FUNCTIONALIZATION USING A MICROSPOTTING ROBOT.  RESEARCH AIM 2 DEVELOPS THE READER.  RESEARCH AIM 3 CONCENTRATES ON REDUCING THE COST OF METASURFACE MICROFABRICATION. PHASE I HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED A SCALABLE FABRICATION PROCESS THAT CAN REDUCE METASURFACE COST TO DOLLARS PER CHIP. METADOT\u2019S ACTIVE PROBING ARCHITECTURE AND TRANSPARENT SUBSTRATE AVOIDS THE PHOTON-STARVED, LOW-SNR OPERATION OF FLUORESCENCE AND OTHER DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES. INSTEAD, METADOT PROVIDES HIGH SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO (SNR) AND HIGHLY ACCURATE AND REPEATABLE MEASUREMENTS. EXISTING PATHOGEN TEST SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN COSTLY, NON-PORTABLE, OR REQUIRE OPERATION BY A LABORATORY TECHNICIAN. IN CONTRAST TO COMMERCIAL SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE (SPR) DETECTION, THE PROPOSED METASURFACE HAS MANY TIMES MORE MICROSCOPIC SURFACE AREA, INCREASING OVERLAP BETWEEN PATHOGENS AND THE EVANESCENT ELECTRIC-FIELD OF THE REFLECTED LIGHT. COMPARED TO EXISTING SPR SENSORS, THE METADOT SYSTEM REDUCES COST AND SIZE BY TWO TO THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. UNLIKE OPTICAL TECHNIQUES BASED ON EXTERNAL LABELING, RESONANCE SHIFTING IN THE METADOT METASURFACE OPERATES AS A REPORTER OF THE PATHOGEN BINDING PHENOMENA IN A LABEL-FREE FASHION AND ENABLES TRANSDUCTION OF THE CAPTURING EVENT DIRECTLY AS A SHIFT IN THE POLARIZATION OF THE REFLECTED LIGHT. THE METADOT REFLECTION PROBE GEOMETRY SEPARATES THE OPTICAL PATH FROM THE TEST SOLUTION, MINIMIZING SCATTER AND ENABLING EXTREMELY LOW NOISE AND HIGH SENSITIVITY.  THE METADOT READER IS DESIGNED TO USE COMMON COMMERCIAL OFF-THE-SHELF (COTS) OPTICS AND ELECTRONICS AND WILL BE EASY TO USE AND INEXPENSIVE TO MANUFACTURE.

THIS TRANSURETHRAL, CATHETER- DELIVERED VALVE IS INTENDED TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF URINE IN ORDER TO REDUCE URINE LEAKAGE AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS OF UI. IT CONSISTS OF A NITINOL SCAFFOLD EMBEDDED IN A BIOCOMPATIBLE POLYMER WITH A COMPLETELY INTEGRATED POLYMERIC INNER VALVE WHICH IS COMPRISED OF A FLEXIBLE LEAFLET-LIKE MEMBRANE. THE K9-ICT VALVE IS PLACED IN THE MID TO PROXIMAL URETHRA AND IS DESIGNED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE URINE LEAKAGE BY RESTORING THE ABILITY TO RETAIN URINE AND VOID AT SIMILAR URINARY BLADDER PRESSURES THAT ARE SEEN IN CONTINENT DOGS. ADDED DURING PHASE I, THE VALVE WILL ALSO BE RETRIEVABLE TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL ADVERSE REACTIONS AND/OR POOR PLACEMENT. THIS PHASE II OBJECTIVE IS TO DEMONSTRATE PRELIMINARY CLINICAL SAFETY OF THE FINAL K9-ICT. CANINE UI IS A CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY INAPPROPRIATE OR \u201cINVOLUNTARY\u201d PASSAGE OF URINE. CLINICAL SIGNS AND SEQUELAE OF UI INCLUDE URINE LEAKAGE, UNWANTED URINATION IN THE HOUSE, SKIN IRRITATION, AND DISCOMFORT. THE MOST COMMON NON-NEUROGENIC CAUSE OF CANINE UI IS URETHRAL SPHINCTER MECHANISM INCOMPETENCE (USMI), WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BE HORMONE-RELATED AND AFFECTS OVER 20% OF SPAYED FEMALE DOGS, EQUATING TO ROUGHLY 5 MILLION PETS IN THE U.S. NONE OF THE CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR UI\u2014MEDICAL MANAGEMENT, URETHRAL BULKING AGENTS, AND SURGICAL CORRECTION\u2014ARE RELIABLY EFFICACIOUS AND ALL CARRY RISKS. VENARUM INTENDS TO LEVERAGE ITS EXPERTISE IN IMPLANTABLE DEVICE TECHNOLOGIES, VETERINARY MEDICINE AND POLYMER SCIENCE TO BRING THE K9-ICT FROM CONCEPT TO MARKET. WE HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH POLYMER-COATED NITINOL STENT TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF A PROSTHETIC VENOUS VALVE AND ARE WELL POSITIONED TO APPLY OUR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING KNOWLEDGE TO MEET THE UNIQUE CHALLENGE OF CANINE UI. EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF UI REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN INTRA-ABDOMINAL PRESSURE, URINARY BLADDER PRESSURE, URETHRAL PRESSURE, SPHINCTER COMPETENCY, AND THE FEEDBACK AND REFLEXES INVOLVED IN THE VOIDING MECHANISM. THROUGH BENCH AND CADAVER STUDIES IN PHASE I, VENARUM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE VALVE CAN EASILY BE DELIVERED; CAN FEASIBLY PREVENT INDISCRIMINATE FLUID LEAKAGE AND PERMIT FLUID PASSAGE WITHIN A DESIRED RANGE OF PRESSURES APPROXIMATING THOSE IN CONTINENT DOGS; AND CAN BE RETRIEVED. UNDER PHASE II, VENARUM PROPOSES TO (1) OPTIMIZE AND FINALIZE THE SYSTEM COMPONENTS (I.E. VALVE, DELIVERY SYSTEM, AND RETRIEVAL TOOL); (2) PERFORM PHYSICAL AND BIOCOMPATIBILITY VERIFICATION TESTING OF THE FINAL K9-ICT SYSTEM; AND (3) PERFORM IN VIVO CANINE CLINICAL PRELIMINARY SAFETY STUDIES CONSISTENT WITH EVALUATIONS OF DEVICES INTENDED FOR HUMAN USE.

ABSTRACT ETHYLENE OXIDE (ETO) STERILIZATION IS THE MOST COMMON METHOD THAT EFFECTIVELY STERILIZES MANY TYPES OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE HEAT-SENSITIVE, MADE FROM CERTAIN POLYMERS, OR WITH LONG LUMENS. HOWEVER, ETO SYSTEMS SUFFER FROM THE LONG STERILIZATION TIME, HIGH COST, THE HIGH TOXICITY OF ETO, AND NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AS A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE GAS PLASMA (HPGP) STERILIZATION ELIMINATES MOST OF THE ABOVE DISADVANTAGES, BUT THE HPGP CANNOT STERILIZE NARROW OR LONG LUMENS OF MEDICAL SCOPES DUE TO THE SUPPRESSED GAS DIFFUSION DEEP INSIDE THE LUMEN, LIMITING ITS POTENTIAL TO COMPLETELY REPLACE ETO. IN ADDITION, HPGP STERILIZATION MAY FAIL IF A THOROUGH DRYING AND CAREFUL LOADING OF THE EQUIPMENT WERE NOT PERFORMED. TO DEVELOP AN EQUIVALENT OR IMPROVED SOLUTION TO ETO WHILE RETAINING THE ADVANTAGES OF HPGP, ADVANCED COOLING TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

STRENGTHENING INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORIES AS THEIR EFFORTS RELATE  TO THE NATIONAL FOOD SAFETY SYSTEM AND THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FOOD SAFETY  MODERNIZATION ACT (FSMA) THROUGH POTENTIAL ANIMAL FOODBORNE ILLNESS OUTBREAKS;  4. MAINTAINING EXCELLENCE IN QUALITY ASSURANCE THROUGH EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND PROFICIENCY EXERCISES,  AND DEVELOPING INTER-AGENCY DATA SHARING PROCESSES;  5. EXPANDING THE LABORATORY\u2019S ISO/IEC 17025:2017 SCOPE OF ACCREDITATION AS IT RELATES TO ANIMAL  DIAGNOSTICS AND FOOD/FEED TESTING. THE MECHANISM FOR ACHIEVING THE ABOVE IS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE FDA VETERINARY LABORATORY INVESTIGATION AND RESPONSE NETWORK (VET-LIRN). THE VET-LIRN PARTNERSHIP SPANS ACROSS VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR SURGE TESTING IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. THE NETWORK ALSO OFFERS PROFICIENCY TESTING OR INTERLABORATORY COMPARISON EXERCISES FOR A VARIETY OF TOXICOLOGICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL AGENTS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FOOD SUPPLY. IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY, THE TN DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (TDA) MAY RECEIVE SAMPLES COLLECTED BY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR OTHER LOCAL SOURCES AS DEEMED NECESSARY FOR THE RESPONSE EFFORT. TDA IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS AGREEMENT AS THE DEPARTMENT\u2019S VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY, THE C. E.

APPROXIMATELY 2,000 INDIVIDUALS OF ALL AGES ARE DIAGNOSED WITH CD EACH YEAR IN THE US. UNICENTRIC CD (UCD) INVOLVES ONE REGION OF ENLARGED LYMPH NODES AND TYPICALLY MILDER INFLAMMATORY SYMPTOMS; THE THREE CURRENTLY-RECOGNIZED SUBTYPES OF MULTICENTRIC CD (MCD) RESULT FROM DIFFERENT ETIOLOGIES BUT INVOLVE PROGRESSIVE EPISODES OF SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY SYMPTOMS AND LIFE-THREATENING CYTOKINE- DRIVEN MULTI-ORGAN DYSFUNCTION, SUCH AS THE LIVER, KIDNEYS, AND BONE MARROW. THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS AND THERAPEUTIC TARGETS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. WHILE VARIOUS TREATMENTS ARE OFTEN TRIED FOR CD, SYSTEMATIC EVALUATIONS OF THESE TREATMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN PERFORMED, THE OPTIMAL TREATMENTS FOR EACH SUBTYPE ARE NOT KNOWN, AND BIOMARKERS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS LIKELY TO RESPOND TO CERTAIN TREATMENTS ARE NEEDED. NEW TREATMENT APPROACHES ARE ALSO NEEDED, BUT NO VALIDATED, PATIENT-CENTRIC TREATMENT RESPONSE CRITERIA OR BIOMARKERS EXIST TO CONSISTENTLY EVALUATE PROMISING TREATMENT APPROACHES IN CLINICAL TRIALS. FURTHER, CLINICAL DATA HAD NOT BEEN CENTRALIZED AND NO EVIDENCE-BASED DIAGNOSTIC OR TREATMENT GUIDELINES EXISTED UNTIL RECENTLY.  TO ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS, WE ESTABLISHED AN INTERNATIONAL LONGITUDINAL NATURAL HISTORY STUDY OF CD IN 2016 THROUGH A 5-YEAR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE CASTLEMAN DISEASE COLLABORATIVE NETWORK, JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICALS, AND THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA (LEAD INSTITUTION). DEVELOPED BY A TEAM OF PHYSICIANS, RESEARCHERS, AND PATIENTS, ACCELERATE UTILIZES AN INNOVATIVE PATIENT-POWERED STUDY DESIGN WHEREBY CD PATIENTS IN THE US AND GLOBALLY SELF-ENROLL ONLINE AND OUR STUDY TEAM OBTAINS AND SYSTEMATICALLY EXTRACTS COMPLETE MEDICAL RECORD DATA INTO A CENTRAL DATABASE. THE USE OF COMMON DATA STANDARDS, RIGOROUS DATA EXTRACTION PROTOCOLS, AND EXPERT ADJUDICATION OF EACH CASE ENSURE THAT THE DATA IS OF HIGH QUALITY AND INTERPRETABILITY. WE HAVE ENROLLED OVER 500 CD PATIENTS AND COLLECTED EXTENSIVE, LONGITUDINAL DATA ON APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF THAT HAVE BEEN LEVERAGED TO CHARACTERIZE THE SPECTRUM OF CD, SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT GUIDELINES, AND ADVANCE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH.  DESPITE THESE ADVANCES, SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEEDS REMAIN FOR THE MAJORITY OF CD PATIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE FDA-APPROVED THERAPY. UNFORTUNATELY, OUR 5-YEAR FUNDED STUDY HAS ENDED. WE ARE SEEKING FUNDING TO LEVERAGE THE DATA COLLECTED FROM OUR 5-YEAR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP, BUILD UPON INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THIS MULTI- STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION, AND CONTINUE ENROLLMENT AND DATA COLLECTION TO IDENTIFY CLINICALLY-MEANINGFUL PATIENT SUBTYPES, CLINICAL OUTCOME MEASURES, AND NOVEL TREATMENT APPROACHES.

THOUGH VALUABLE, EXISTING ALS REGISTRIES HAVE EITHER LARGE SAMPLES SIZES BUT LIMITED CLINICAL INFORMATION, FOCUS ON RELATIVELY SMALL SUBSETS OF THE ALS POPULATION, OR PROVIDE INFORMATION FROM A RELATIVELY BRIEF PERIOD. HOWEVER, AS A PART OF ROUTINE CLINICAL CARE, ALS MULTIDISCIPLINARY CLINICS (MDCS) DEVELOP A RICH NATURAL HISTORY DATASET FROM ALL ALS PATIENTS, AND MOST PEOPLE LIVING WITH ALS ARE SEEN AT MDCS.

A-T IS COMPLEX AND HIGHLY VARIABLE IN TERMS OF PRESENTATION AND SEVERITY, BUT THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS VARIABILITY ARE NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD.

WE FURTHER OBSERVED THAT COMPARED TO PRC2-WILD-TYPE (WT), TREATMENT WITH A PAN-DNMT INHIBITOR (DECITABINE) OR A SELECTIVE DNMT1 INHIBITOR (GSK862) RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED TOXICITY IN VARIOUS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO MPNST MODELS WITH PRC2 INACTIVATION. IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS STUDIES OF DNMT INHIBITORS IN SOLID TUMORS THAT TYPICALLY DEMONSTRATED MINIMAL ANTITUMOR EFFECTS, DNMT INHIBITORS IMPOSED SIGNIFICANT ANTITUMOR EFFECT IN THE PRC2-LOSS CONTEXT THROUGH PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT PRC2 LOSS CREATES A CRITICAL DEPENDENCE ON THE DNA METHYLATION- MEDIATED ERV REGULATION IN TUMOR CELLS AND DNMT INHIBITION MAY REPRESENT A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY IN PRC2- LOSS MPNSTS. HERE, WE PROPOSE A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT INVESTIGATOR-INITIATED PHASE II TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF ASTX727 (COMBINATION OF DECITABINE AND CEDAZURIDINE) IN PATIENTS WITH PRC2-LOSS MPNSTS. THE PHASE II TRIAL IS RICH IN PRE-TREATMENT, ON-TREATMENT, AND AT DISEASE PROGRESSION RESEARCH BIOPSIES, AS WELL AS EXPLORATORY CORRELATIVE STUDIES USING CUTTING-EDGE GENETIC, EPIGENETIC, AND TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSES AT SINGLE CELL LEVEL WITH THE GOALS TO EVALUATE FOR BIOMARKERS AND MECHANISMS OF THERAPEUTIC SENSITIVITY AND RESISTANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CLINICAL STUDY WILL GENERATE THE PIVOTAL BIOMARKER-DRIVEN CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL INFORMATION FOR A DEFINITIVE TRIAL OF ASTX727 IN PRC2-LOSS MPNST WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DELINEATE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES IN OTHER CANCER TYPES WITH GENETIC OR FUNCTIONAL INACTIVATION OF PRC2.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b514fc3a-d769-87e9-75ea-7a6766afb5ee-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01FD007544_7524"}, {"internal_id": 151589634, "Award ID": "R01FD007540", "Award Amount": 1334374.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-19", "CFDA Number": "93.103", "Description": "PHASE 1 STUDY OF AUTOLOGOUS CD4LVFOXP3 IN PARTICIPANTS WITH IPEX SYNDROME [REVISED IND AND CLINICAL PROTOCOL TO BE SUBMITTED TO FDA BY 10/11/2021] - PROJECT SUMMARY WE PROPOSE A NOVEL REGULATORY T (TREG) CELL THERAPY TO TREAT IPEX SYNDROME, A RARE AUTOIMMUNE MONOGENIC DISEASE. IPEX IS A LIFE-THREATENING DISEASE CAUSED BY LOSS-OF-FUNCTION FOXP3 MUTATIONS LEADING TO DYSFUNCTIONAL TREG CELLS. THE ONLY CURRENT CURATIVE TREATMENT FOR IPEX IS ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (ALLO-HSCT), WHICH IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO A MINORITY OF PATIENTS. THE PROPOSED PRODUCT, CD4LVFOXP3 CONSISTS OF AUTOLOGOUS CD4+ T CELLS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE LENTIVIRAL VECTOR (LV)-MEDIATED GENE TRANSFER OF WILD-TYPE HUMAN FOXP3 LEADING TO PERSISTENT HIGH FOXP3 EXPRESSION AND ACQUISITION OF TREG CELL PHENOTYPE AND FUNCTION. CD4LVFOXP3 WERE GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION IN OCTOBER, 2020. BASED ON THE ETIOLOGY OF IPEX, OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF AUTOLOGOUS CD4+ T CELLS CONVERTED INTO CD4LVFOXP3 TREG-LIKE CELLS BY LV-MEDIATED FOXP3 GENE TRANSFER, WILL REDUCE THE IMMUNE DYSREGULATION AND THE AUTOIMMUNE MANIFESTATIONS. CD4LVFOXP3 IS FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT TO TREG CELLS AND THEREFORE, OFFER A NOVEL CELL THERAPY APPROACH THAT CIRCUMVENTS THE REQUIREMENT FOR GENERALIZED IMMUNE SUPPRESSION (IS) AND COULD IMPROVE THE CLINICAL STATUS OF PARTICIPANTS. THIS FIRST-TIME-IN-HUMAN (FTIH) PHASE 1 CLINICAL TRIAL WILL TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURING AND THE SAFETY OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF CD4LVFOXP3 (AIM 1) IN MINIMUM OF 20 UP TO 36 EVALUABLE HUMAN PARTICIPANTS WITH IPEX, WHO MEET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. THE SECONDARY OBJECTIVE IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THE CD4LVFOXP3 INFUSION ON CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS. THE DOSING RATIONALE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WITH A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH BASED ON INITIAL CELL DOSES USED IN PREVIOUS CLINICAL TRIALS WITH TREG CELLS OF DIFFERENT ORIGINS. CD4LVFOXP3 ALSO EXPRESS MEMBRANE NGFR (CD271) ENCODED WITHIN THE SAME LV CONSTRUCT THAT CONTAINS THE FOXP3 GENE. ALLOWING EX VIVO PURIFICATION AND TRACEABILITY ENABLING FURTHER STUDIES OF CD4LVFOXP3SURVIVAL, PHENOTYPIC STABILITY AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS. THUS, DURING THIS CLINICAL TRIAL, WE WILL PERFORM EXPLORATORY STUDIES TO BUILD KNOWLEDGE ON THE CD4LVFOXP3 PHARMACOKINETICS (PK) (AIM2) AND PHARMACODYNAMICS (PD) (AIM 3) BY MONITORING THE IMMUNE PHENOTYPE AND FUNCTION OF PATIENT IMMUNE CELLS. THE POSSIBILITY TO PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL AUTOLOGOUS TREG-LIKE CELLS IS EXPECTED TO BE OF BENEFIT TO ALL ELIGIBLE IPEX PATIENTS. CD4LVFOXP3 COULD: 1. IMPROVE CONTROL OF CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS RESULTING IN THE REDUCTION OF IS AND RELATED SIDE EFFECTS, AND 2. DIMINISH THE NEED FOR ALLO- HSCT, OR ALLOW PATIENTS TO BE TRANSPLANTED IN A MORE STABLE CLINICAL CONDITION, RESULTING IN IMPROVED ALLO-HSCT OUTCOMES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS CLINICAL TRIAL IN PATIENTS WITH IPEX USING CD4LVFOXP3 TREG-LIKE CELLS AS A FUNCTIONAL REPLACEMENT FOR FOXP3 MUTATED TREG CELLS, ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEED WHILE ALSO PROVIDING PROOF OF SAFETY AND PRELIMINARY INDICATIONS OF BENEFIT IN CONTROLLING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE MANIFESTATIONS.

THERE IS NO CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE MEANS OF TREATMENT FOR DIPG, AND THE MEDIAN SURVIVAL IS 7-11 MONTHS AFTER DIAGNOSIS. THUS, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR A METHOD TO EFFECTIVELY TREAT DIPG. TO ADDRESS THIS UNMET NEED, SONALASENSE IS DEVELOPING SONODYNAMIC THERAPY (SDT), A NON-INVASIVE DRUG-DEVICE COMBINATION, TO TREAT DIPG. SDT USES AN MRI-GUIDED FOCUSED ULTRASOUND (MRGFUS) DEVICE IN COMBINATION WITH A DRUG CALLED 5-AMINOLEVULINIC ACID (ALA; SONALA-001).

THESE DATA WILL PROVIDE ROBUST EVIDENCE TO OPTIMIZE PHASE II/III TRIAL DESIGN, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A NEW INDICATION FOR WSD IN HGA. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS EVALUATED IN THREE AIMS: AIM 1: EVALUATE THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY AND SYSTEMIC PK OF WSD AT MTD. PATIENTS WITH EGFR-AMPLIFIED / EGFRVIII HGA OR NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER WITH CNS METASTASES WILL BE TREATED WITH WSD IN A DOSE ESCALATION COHORT TO DEFINE THE MTD AND EVALUATE THE TOXICITY PROFILE OF WSD. PLASMA PK WILL BE QUANTIFIED BY LC-MS/MS TO EVALUATE SYSTEMIC EXPOSURE. A DOSE EXPANSION COHORT WILL ALSO INCLUDE A FOOD-EFFECT STUDY PRIOR TO STARTING CONTINUOUS DOSING. PLASMA PK WILL BE QUANTIFIED IN BOTH THE FED (WSD DOSED AFTER A HIGH FAT MEAL) AND FASTED STATES (WSD DOSED ONE HOUR BEFORE OR TWO HOURS AFTER EATING) TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF FOOD ON SYSTEMIC PK. AIM 2: EVALUATE INTRATUMORAL PK OF WSD AND ASSESS ITS PHARMACODYNAMIC (PD) IMPACT ON EGFR PATHWAY SIGNALING IN HGA. PATIENTS WITH EGFR-AMPLIFIED / EGFRVIII HGA REQUIRING A THERAPEUTIC SURGICAL TUMOR RESECTION AS PART OF ROUTINE CLINICAL CARE WILL PREOPERATIVELY BE DOSED WITH WSD AT MTD. DURING SURGERY, TUMOR TISSUE WILL BE COLLECTED AND FLASH FROZEN. TUMOR PK WILL BE QUANTIFIED BY LC-MS/MS AND PD IMPACT ON EGFR PATHWAY SIGNALING WILL BE EVALUATED BY FUNCTIONAL PROTEOMICS. AIM 3: CHARACTERIZE THE MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS WHICH INFLUENCE EFFICACY OF WSD IN PATIENTS WITH EGFR ABERRANT HGA. PATIENTS WITH EGFR- AMPLIFIED / EGFRVIII HGA WILL BE TREATED CONTINUOUSLY WITH WSD AT MTD AND MONITORED FOR TREATMENT EFFICACY.

WE FOCUS ON GENETIC ORPHAN DISEASES WITH HIGH UNMET MEDICAL NEED.

PATIENTS PRESENT WITH STRESS-MEDIATED VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGH INCIDENCE OF SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH. THE TYPICAL PATIENT WITH CPVT IS A CHILD OR YOUNG ADULT (MEAN AGE AT DIAGNOSIS 6-10 YEARS OLD) FREE OF STRUCTURAL CARDIAC DISEASE, WITH A NORMAL RESTING ELECTROCARDIOGRAM, WHO PRESENTS WITH EXERCISE OR EMOTIONALLY- INDUCED PALPITATIONS OR SYNCOPE. IF NOT MANAGED, CPVT IS A HIGHLY LETHAL DISEASE WITH AN UNTREATED MORTALITY RATE OF 30-50% BY THE AGE OF 40. THE PRIMARY STANDARD-OF-CARE REGIMEN IS A COMBINATION OF BETA-BLOCKERS AND SODIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS TO PREVENT ELEVATIONS OF HEART RATE, WHICH CAN LEAD TO THE FATAL ARRYTHMIAS. THE CHALLENGE WITH THE CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE IS THAT THESE DRUGS LEAD TO FATIGUE AND GENERALIZED MALAISE WHEN DOSED TO A HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL TO PREVENT ELEVATIONS OF HEART RATE. PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN, IT IS CHALLENGING TO ENSURE THAT DOSES ARE NOT MISSED AND THAT THERE IS NO SELF-REDUCTION OF DOSES, WHICH CAN BE LETHAL. THERE IS A HIGH UNMET NEED FOR A MEDICAL THERAPY WHICH REPAIRS LEAKY RYR CHANNELS SO THAT ELEVATIONS OF HEART RATE WITH EXERCISE ARE WELL TOLERATED AND NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SUDDEN DEATH.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE SAFETY, MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE (MTD), AND IMMUNOGENICITY OF RNA-LPS VACCINES IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED ADULT GBM PATIENTS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT RNA-LPS WILL MEDIATE SYSTEMIC IMMUNE REPROGRAMMING OF GBM UNLOCKING IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1. CONDUCT PHASE I STUDY EVALUATING SAFETY, MTD AND IMMUNOGENICITY OF RNA-LPS AGAINST GBM.  A. CHARACTERIZE SYSTEMIC IMMUNE RESPONSE IN PATIENTS PRIOR TO RECEIVING RNA-LPS AND EFFECT  CHANGE FOLLOWING VACCINATION.  I. IDENTIFY IMMUNOLOGIC PHENOTYPE OF MYELOID AND LYMPHOCYTE SUBSETS (NA\u00cfVE, EFFECTOR, MEMORY,  REGULATORY) AND NK CELLS IN PATIENTS WITH GBM AT DIAGNOSIS AND THROUGHOUT THERAPY.  II. ELUCIDATE CHANGES IN CYTOKINE PROFILE AND PATHOGEN-RECOGNITION RECEPTOR (PRR) ACTIVATION  STATUS IN PATIENTS WITH GBM DURING/AFTER RNA-LP VACCINES.  III. IDENTIFY POTENTIAL TUMOR SPECIFIC ANTIGENS AS VACCINE CANDIDATES THROUGH WHOLE EXOME  SEQUENCING, RNA-SEQ, AND NEOANTIGEN PREDICTION ANALYSIS.  B. ESTABLISH MEMORY RECALL T CELL IMMUNITY IN VACCINATED PATIENTS  C.

IT IS DEFINED BY INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS CRITERIA THAT MAY BE SUMMARIZED AS LOSS OF B CELL FUNCTION DEVELOPING AFTER INFANCY WITH OR WITHOUT A WELL-DESCRIBED CONSTELLATION OF AUTOIMMUNE OR LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE COMPLICATIONS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DISTINCTIVE FORM OF INTERSTITIAL LUNG DIS- EASE, TERMED GRANULOMATOUS-LYMPHOCYTIC INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (GLILD), IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC IN CVID BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY COMMON, ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY, AND HAS AN UNMET NEED FOR ADEQUATE TREATMENTS. WE FOUND THAT THE BIOLOGIC DRUG ABATACEPT SHOWED GOOD EFFICACY FOR REVERSAL OF SEVERE, OFTEN REFRACTORY GLILD IN A SMALL SERIES OF PATIENTS WITH CVID. ABATACEPT IS A RECOMBINANT FUSION PROTEIN INCOR- PORATING CTLA-4 (CYTOTOXIC T LYMPHOCYTE\u2013ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 4) THAT BLOCKS T CELL ACTIVATION BY BINDING TO CD80/CD86, THEREBY PREVENTING CD28 ENGAGEMENT. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ABATACEPT WOULD BE AN EFFEC- TIVE THERAPY FOR GLILD IN CVID. HOWEVER, RIGOROUS CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO PROSPECTIVELY DEFINE THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF ABATACEPT AS A THERAPY FOR GLILD.  TO FILL THIS CRITICAL GAP, WE HAVE DESIGNED THE ABCVILD TRIAL. IN THIS TRIAL, WE PLAN TO TREAT WITH EITHER PLA- CEBO OR ABATACEPT IN A DOUBLE-BLINDED FASHION. FOLLOWING A SIX-MONTH BLINDED TREATMENT PHASE, PATIENTS WILL ENTER A SIX-MONTH OPEN-LABEL PHASE IN WHICH THEY WILL START OR CONTINUE ABATACEPT. ON THE BASIS OF OUR CLINICAL EXPERIENCE TO DATE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT 6 MONTHS OF ABATACEPT THERAPY (COMPARED TO PLACEBO) WILL CLINICALLY IMPROVE GLILD (AS ASSESSED BY OBJECTIVE AND QOL MEASURES) ACROSS CVID GENOTYPES AND IMPROVE SCD25 AND OTHER EXPLORATORY BIOMARKERS OF T CELL ACTIVATION. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY PURSUING THESE AIMS:  AIM 1: DETERMINE THE RESPONSE RATE OF GLILD AFTER SIX MONTHS OF ABATACEPT THERAPY (VERSUS PLACEBO). OUR READOUTS FOR THE ABCVILD TRIAL INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF CHEST CT SCANS, PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS, QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURES, AND RADIATION-FREE MEASURE 129XE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGE (MRI).  AIM 2: DETERMINE WHETHER GENOTYPE AND/OR LUNG HISTOLOGY PREDICT GLILD RESPONSIVENESS TO ABATACEPT THERAPY. AS CD4+ T CELLS ARE OFTEN THE MOST PROMINENT INFILTRATING CELLS IN GLILD AND T FOLLICULAR HELPER (TFH) CELLS HAVE BEEN SHOWN EXPERIMENTALLY TO BE SENSITIVE TO CD28/CTLA4 MANIPULATION, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT GLILD IS LARGELY A DISEASE OF TFH CELLS AND THAT RESPONSIVENESS WILL CORRELATE WITH THESE CELLS IN LESIONS.  AIM 3: DEFINE THE UTILITY OF SCD25, ABATACEPT PHARMACOKINETICS, OR EXPLORATORY BIOMARKERS OF T CELL ACTI- VATION FOR PREDICTING RESPONSE TO THERAPY.

EFFECTIVE EARLY TREATMENT IMPROVES HR-QOL AND MAY PREVENT DISEASE PROGRESSION. AS PER CURRENT NCCN GUIDELINES, MANY SKIN-DIRECTED THERAPIES (SDTS) ARE USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF EARLY STAGE MF/CTCL INCLUDING TOPICALS, ULTRAVIOLET (UV) PHOTOTHERAPY, AND RADIATION THERAPY. NONE HAVE BEEN FDA-APPROVED FOR FIRST-LINE THERAPY AND MOST ARE USED OFF-LABEL. GIVEN THE CHRONIC, RECURRENT NATURE OF MF/CTCL, MOST PATIENTS REQUIRE REPEAT COURSES OF THERAPY AND TRYING OTHER THERAPIES. THE USE OF SEVERAL SDTS ARE LIMITED BY SKIN IRRITATION/DERMATITIS AND LONG-TERM CUMULATIVE TOXICITY. GIVEN THIS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SDTS FOR CTCL WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. TOPICAL HYPERICIN IS NON-MUTAGENIC, NOT SYSTEMICALLY ABSORBED, ACTIVATED BY NONCARCINOGENIC VISIBLE LIGHT, SELECTIVELY TAKEN UP BY TUMOR CELLS IN THE SKIN (UP TO 10-FOLD) AND INDUCES MITOCHONDRIAL APOPTOSIS.

IN CYCLE 2 THE ORR IN PATIENTS RECEIVING SGX301 FOR BOTH CYCLES (12 WEEKS) WAS 40% (P<0.0001 VS PLACEBO OR 6 WEEKS OF TREATMENT). SGX301 TREATMENT IS SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED, WITH POTENTIAL FAVORABLE LONG-TERM SAFETY GIVEN ITS MODE OF ACTION.

THE TREATMENTS INCLUDE A HIGH-CALORIE DIET AND FEEDING THROUGH THE VEIN (I.E., PARENTERAL NUTRITION OR PN), AMONG OTHERS. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT WEAN FROM PN DUE TO REDUCED INTESTINAL LENGTH OR FUNCTION. PATIENTS ON LONG-TERM PN FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCE SERIOUS METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS, SEPSIS, HEPATIC BILIARY DISORDERS INCLUDING CHOLESTASIS, AND FIBROSIS AND CAN PROGRESS TO LIVER FAILURE. FULL INTESTINAL FEEDING (ENTERAL NUTRITION) WITHOUT PN IS THE OPTIMAL WAY TO PREVENT THE ABOVE COMPLICATIONS.  ENTERALLY ADMINISTERED LONG CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDES IN PATIENTS WITH SBS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION, ARE NOT WELL TOLERATED DUE TO BILE ACID MALABSORPTION, WHICH LEADS TO DECREASED MICELLE FORMATION AND FAT DIGESTION. THE DIETARY FAT IS UNABLE TO BE EMULSIFIED BY THE BILE ACIDS AND ACTED ON BY LIPASES BEFORE EXITING THE PATIENT AS STOOL. SWITCHING TO OTHER FORMS OF FAT SUCH AS MEDIUM-CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDES (MCTS) THAT DO NOT REQUIRE MICELLES FOR ABSORPTION MAY BE BETTER TOLERATED IN PATIENTS WITH BILE ACID OR PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY BUT ARE NOT OPTIMAL AS THEY INCREASE THE OSMOTIC LOAD IN THE INTESTINE. THIS MAY INCREASE THE CHANCE OF STOOL DUMPING; MOREOVER, MCTS DO NOT CONTAIN ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS (FAS). THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE ESSENTIAL FAS SUCH AS THOSE PRESENT IN ENTERAL FORMULAS IN A FORM THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE FORMATION OF MICELLES FOR ABSORPTION, WOULD ALLOW PATIENTS WITH SBS AND THOSE WHO ARE NO LONGER PN DEPENDENT TO RECEIVE ADEQUATE NUTRITION AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE SAME GROWTH TRAJECTORY AS WHEN THEY RECEIVED THE MAJORITY OF THEIR NUTRITION PARENTERALLY.  RELIZORB IS AN ENZYME CARTRIDGE CONNECTED IN-LINE WITH ENTERAL FEED TUBING SETS DESIGNED TO MIMIC THE FUNCTION OF PANCREATIC LIPASE. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT BY USING THIS EXTERNAL LIPASE DEVICE, ENTERAL NUTRITION WILL BE BETTER ABSORBED, AND PN DEPENDENCE REDUCED AS ENTERAL AUTONOMY IS INCREASED. THIS PRODUCT ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR INTESTINAL EMULSIFICATION AND ELIMINATES THE RISK OF DRUGS, INCLUDING LIPASES, ALLOWING ABSORPTION AT THE TIME THE DIET ENTERS THE GUT. THE DEVICE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DIGEST >90% OF FAT IN MOST ENTERAL FORMULAS.

NEONATAL SEIZURES AFFECT 1 IN 300 INFANTS. SURVIVORS HAVE HIGH RATES (40-60%) OF PERMANENT DISABILITIES SUCH AS CEREBRAL PALSY, GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY AND EPILEPSY. THERE IS MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT SEIZURES CONTRIBUTE TO BRAIN INJURY AND NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY; BETTER TREATMENT MAY IMPROVE LONG-TERM NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES. DESPITE THE RANDOMIZED NEOLEV2 CLINICAL TRIAL SHOWING GREATER SEIZURE CONTROL WITH PHENOBARBITAL (PHB), PHB PRODUCED INCREASED ACUTE SIDE EFFECTS IN COMPARISON TO STANDARD DOSE LEVETIRACETAM (LEV). THESE SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDED RESPIRATORY SUPPRESSION, HYPOTENSION, AND SEDATION. FURTHERMORE, THERE HAS BEEN CONCERN REGARDING LONG-TERM NEUROCOGNITIVE SIDE EFFECTS OF PHB. THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL REFINE THE STANDARD CLINICAL PARADIGM FOR NEONATAL SEIZURE TREATMENT BY DEMONSTRATING A STRATIFIED APPROACH; USING AN ANTI-SEIZURE TREATMENT WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED EFFECT PROFILE, LEV, TARGETED AT REDUCING MILD TO MODERATE SEIZURE BURDEN, RESERVING PHB WITH ITS ASSOCIATED SIDE EFFECTS FOR NEONATES WITH HIGH SEIZURE BURDEN.  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES ARE TO (1) OPTIMIZE THE USE OF A NEWER, SAFER, NON-TOXIC ANTICONVULSANT MEDICATION FOR NEONATES WITH SEIZURES AND (2) DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ALLOW FOR ACCURATE IMMEDIATE AUTOMATED DIAGNOSIS OF SEIZURES.  A DOSE ESCALATION AND SAFETY STUDY WILL BE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE OF LEV. INFANTS WHO CONTINUE TO HAVE SEIZURES FOLLOWING STANDARD DOSE LEV WILL RECEIVE EITHER HIGHER DOSE LEV OR THE CONTROL DRUG PHB, RANDOMIZED IN A 3:1 ALLOCATION RATIO. DOSE ESCALATION WILL PROCEED IN 3 PHASES TO THE MAXIMAL LOADING DOSE OF 150MG/KG. A MINIMUM OF 10 SUBJECTS WILL BE STUDIED AT EACH DOSING LEVEL AND SAFETY DATA WILL DETERMINE IF DOSE LIMITING TOXICITY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BEFORE FURTHER DOSE ESCALATION. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WILL BE THE MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE. A SECONDARY ENDPOINT WILL BE THE ADDITIONAL EFFICACY OF HIGHER DOSES OF LEV COMPARED WITH STANDARD DOSE LEV. THE PHARMACOKINETICS OF HIGH DOSE LEV IN NEONATES WILL BE STUDIED.

NEUROBLASTOMA IS A PROTOTYPICAL MYC-DRIVEN CANCER, WITH MYCN AMPLIFIED NEUROBLASTOMA REPRESENTING A PARTICULARLY AGGRESSIVE FORM OF THIS DISEASE. NEUROBLASTOMA THEREFORE PROVIDES AN IDEAL SETTING IN WHICH TO TEST NOVEL AGENTS THAT TARGET MYC FAMILY GENES. SF1126 IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL INTEGRIN-TARGETED INHIBITOR OF PI3- KINASE AND BRD4 THAT SHOWS PRECLINICAL ACTIVITY IN MODELS OF MYCN AMPLIFIED NEUROBLASTOMA. SF1126 HAS COMPLETED PHASE 1 TESTING IN ADULTS WITH A RANGE OF CANCERS, WITH A FAVORABLE TOXICITY PROFILE. THE FDA HAS GRANTED AN IND FOR THE CONDUCT OF AN INVESTIGATOR-INITIATED PHASE 1 STUDY OF SF1126 IN CHILDREN WITH RELAPSED OR REFRACTORY NEUROBLASTOMA. THIS PHASE 1 STUDY IS BEING CONDUCTED BY THE NEW APPROACHES TO NEUROBLASTOMA THERAPY (NANT) CONSORTIUM, A GROUP OF LEADING CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA WITH EXPERTISE IN THE CARE OF CHILDREN WITH ADVANCED NEUROBLASTOMA. THE STUDY CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS: A DOSE ESCALATION PART AND A DOSE EXPANSION PART FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH MYC OR MYCN-DRIVEN NEUROBLASTOMA. IN THE DOSE ESCALATION PART, A RANGE OF SF1126 DOSES IS BEING EVALUATED USING A STANDARD 3+3 DESIGN TO DEFINE A RECOMMENDED PHASE 2 PEDIATRIC DOSE. THIS PART OF THE STUDY WILL INCLUDE PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED OR REFRACTORY NEUROBLASTOMA REGARDLESS OF MOLECULAR SUBTYPE. IN THE DOSE EXPANSION PART, PATIENTS WITH MYCN AMPLIFIED NEUROBLASTOMA OR MYC-EXPRESSING NEUROBLASTOMA WILL BE TREATED AT THE RECOMMENDED PHASE 2 PEDIATRIC DOSE TO ASSESS THE ACTIVITY OF SF1126 IN THIS MOLECULARLY DEFINED SUBGROUP. KEY SECONDARY OBJECTIVES WILL INCLUDE EVALUATION OF THE PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE OF SF1126 IN THIS PEDIATRIC POPULATION, ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACODYNAMIC MARKERS OF SF1126 ACTIVITY, AND EVALUATION OF SURROGATE MARKERS OF ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY. THIS AWARD WILL SUPPORT COMPLETION OF THIS TRIAL BY: 1) ENABLING MANUFACTURE AND VIALING OF ADDITIONAL SF1126; 2) FUNDING THE RESEARCH TEAM CONDUCTING THE TRIAL; 3) SUPPORTING EFFORT AT NANT INSTITUTIONS WHO ENROLL PATIENTS; AND 4) FUNDING CENTRAL REVIEW OF RESPONSE. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE TRIAL WILL PROVIDE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT FOR THE ROLE OF SF1126 IN TARGETING MYC-DRIVEN CANCERS.
