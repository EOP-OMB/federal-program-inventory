MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT WILL EMPLOY POLYACRYLAMIDE NANOPARTICLES THAT UNDERGO A VOLUME PHASE TRANSITION BELOW A TEMPERATURE THRESHOLD. LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION WILL INVOLVE HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER THROUGH A HELE-SHAW CELL THAT EXHIBITS CHANNELED-FLOW BEHAVIOR. THE SMALL-SCALE FIELD DEMONSTRATION WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HYDRAULIC CONTROL IN A WELL-CHARACTERIZED FIELD LABORATORY THAT IS KNOWN TO EXHIBIT EXTREME SHORT CIRCUITING. FINALLY, THE COMMERCIAL-SCALE DEMONSTRATION WILL EVALUATE OUR HYDRAULIC CONTROL TREATMENT IN AN ACTIVE GEOTHERMAL RESERVOIR.\nTHE PROPOSED WORK WILL BE PERFORMED OVER THE COURSE OF THREE 12-MONTH BUDGET PERIODS.
