THIS CONTRACTION HAS LARGELY BEEN LINKED TO HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION DUE TO RISING SEA-LEVEL, WOODY ENCROACHMENT, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, BECAUSE BLACK RAILS ARE DIFFICULT TO STUDY USING TRADITIONAL SURVEY METHODOLOGY (I.E. THEY ARE RARE, SMALL (  40 G), VOCALLY ACTIVE AT NIGHT, AND TYPICALLY OCCUPY TIDAL MARSH HABITAT), VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR BASIC ECOLOGY AND POPULATION SIZE. THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS AS TO THE FACTORS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE PRESUMED POPULATION DECLINES THAT LIKELY UNDERLIE THIS RANGE CONTRACTION. THEREFORE, TO DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR ECOLOGY AND ABUNDANCE WE PLAN TO DEVELOP AND EMPLOY AN AUTOMATED PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MONITORING PROTOCOL THAT LEVERAGES CONTINUOUS MONITORING WITH AUTOMATED SONG CLASSIFICATION USING A RECENTLY DEVELOPED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM - BIRDNET. THROUGH THIS WORK, WE AIM TO 1) DEVELOP A VIABLE SECRETIVE MARSH BIRD MONITORING PROTOCOL TAILORED FOR BLACK RAILS (AND AMENABLE TOWARDS OTHER ELUSIVE SPECIES), AND 2) CONTRIBUTE TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR BASIC ECOLOGY (PHENOLOGY, CALLING BEHAVIOR, AND ABUNDANCE) AND 3) AS A CASE STUDY, IMPLEMENT THIS STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL TO MONITOR FOR BLACK RAILS ON PROPOSED RESTORATION PROJECT.
