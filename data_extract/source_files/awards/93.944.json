NHBS IS AN ANONYMOUS BIO-BEHAVIORAL SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITY WHICH FOCUSES ON RECRUITING POPULATIONS THAT ARE OVERBURDENED WITH HIV INFECTION: MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM), PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS (PWID), AND HETEROSEXUALLY ACTIVE PERSONS AT INCREASED RISK (HET). THIS PROJECT WILL CONSIST OF A SERIES OF FIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEYS USING THE SAME INTERVIEW INSTRUMENT, WHICH WILL RECRUIT EACH OF THE ABOVE RISK POPULATIONS (MSM IN YEARS 2 AND 5, PWID IN YEARS 1 AND 3, HET IN YEAR 3). THE PROPOSED SAMPLE SIZE IS AN ANNUAL MINIMUM OF 500 PARTICIPANTS. THE PROPOSED ACTIVITY WILL INCLUDE A DETAILED QUESTIONNAIRE TO GATHER INFORMATION ON DEMOGRAPHICS, SEXUAL AND DRUG USE BEHAVIORS, HIV TESTING, AND UTILIZATION OF LOCAL HIV PREVENTION PROGRAM SERVICES. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WILL BE STANDARDIZED NATIONALLY, WITH THE ADDITION OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO BALTIMORE. THE STUDY WILL ALSO OFFER ANONYMOUS HIV TESTING, UTILIZING FDA APPROVED HIV DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, AND COLLECT SPECIMENS FOR ADDITIONAL FUTURE TESTING. THE SAMPLING AND RECRUITMENT METHODOLOGIES WILL BE SELECTED AS APPROPRIATE FOR EACH OF THE TARGET POPULATIONS AND ARE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CDC. RECRUIT METHODS INCLUDE VENUE-BASED SAMPLING (VBS), RESPONDENT-DRIVEN SAMPLING (RDS), AND OTHER CDC-APPROVED SAMPLING METHODOLOGIES. IN VBS, DAY-TIME RECRUITMENT PERIODS AT PUBLIC VENUES (E.G., BARS, CLUBS, ETC.) IN BALTIMORE CITY WILL BE RANDOMLY SAMPLED AND PARTICIPANT WILL BE SYSTEMATICALLY APPROACHED FOR RECRUITMENT. IN RDS, INITIAL PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RECRUITED THROUGH COMMUNITY KEY INFORMANTS AND THEN BE TRAINED TO RECRUIT ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THEIR RISK GROUP. SUCCESSIVE WAVES OF RECRUITS WILL BE TRAINED TO RECRUIT ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANTS. SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR OPTIONAL POPULATIONS AND ACTIVITIES IS REQUESTED TO DEVELOP METHODS FOR AND THEN TO PERFORM ANONYMOUS GONORRHEA AND CHLAMYDIA TESTING FOR MSM RECRUITS DURING YEARS 2 AND 5 AND HET RECRUITS DURING YEAR 3.

IN 2020, 217 INDIVIDUALS WERE NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH HIV IN THE DISTRICT, MARKING AN 83% DECREASE FROM THE NUMBER OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV CASES DOCUMENTED IN 2007 (N=1,374). UNFORTUNATELY, SUCH DECLINES HAVE NOT BEEN CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL POPULATIONS, CONTRIBUTING TO PERSISTENT DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN THE RISK AND BURDEN OF HIV INFECTION WITHIN THE DISTRICT. WHILE A 46% DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED CASES WAS OBSERVED WITHIN THE BLACK POPULATION OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, ONLY A 37% DECLINE WAS OBSERVED WITHIN THE LATINO POPULATION COMPARED TO A 41.5% DECLINE WITHIN THE WHITE POPULATION OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD. OVERALL, BLACK MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM)/BLACK MSM WHO ALSO ENGAGED IN INJECTION DRUG USE (IDU) AND BLACK HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN ACCOUNTED FOR 34% AND 15.5%, RESPECTIVELY, OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV CASES IN THE DISTRICT FROM 2016 THROUGH 2020 (N=1,586), FOLLOWED BY BLACK HETEROSEXUAL MEN (9%), AND WHITE (9%) AND LATINO (8%) MSM/IDU. WHILE LIKELY UNDERESTIMATED DUE TO THE LIMITATIONS OF SURVEILLANCE DATA, APPROXIMATELY 3% OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV CASES IN THE DISTRICT FROM 2016 THROUGH 2020 OCCURRED WITHIN THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. SLIGHTLY OVER 50% OF ALL INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE DISTRICT DIAGNOSED WITH HIV ARE 50 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER; HOWEVER, NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV CASES TEND TO OCCUR WITHIN YOUNGER AGE COHORTS. FROM 2016 THROUGH 2020, APPROXIMATELY 34% OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV CASES IN THE DISTRICT OCCURRED AMONG THOSE AGED 20 TO 29, WITH INDIVIDUALS AGED 30 TO 39 ACCOUNTING FOR THE SECOND LARGEST PROPORTION (28%) OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV CASES. GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE HIGHEST HIV BURDEN AND RATES OF NEW INFECTION ARE OBSERVED IN THE SOUTHEAST REGION OF THE DISTRICT, COMPRISED OF WARDS 5,6, 7, AND 8. THE HIV/AIDS, HEPATITIS, STD, & TB ADMINISTRATION (HAHSTA) WITHIN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (DC HEALTH) RECENTLY INITIATED THE DC ENDS HIV PLAN OUTLINING HIV PREVENTION AND TREATMENT STRATEGIES TARGETED TOWARDS ENSURING THAT 95% OF HIV POSITIVE DISTRICT RESIDENTS ARE AWARE OF THEIR STATUS; 95% OF DISTRICT RESIDENTS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV ARE IN TREATMENT; 95% OF DISTRICT RESIDENTS LIVING WITH HIV WHO ARE IN TREATMENT ARE VIRALLY SUPPRESSED; AND OVER 13,000 DISTRICT RESIDENTS AT HIGH-RISK FOR HIV INFECTION ARE ENGAGED IN PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) UTILIZATION. BY THE END OF 2030, THE DISTRICT HAS A TARGET OF FEWER THAN 130 NEW HIV DIAGNOSES PER YEAR.
