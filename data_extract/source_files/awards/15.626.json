THE LESSONS ARE TAUGHT BY SCHOOLTEACHERS TO STUDENTS IN GRADES 4 12. THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN WILDLIFE ASSOCIATED RECREATION AND OTHER ARCHERY RELATED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS BOW HUNTING. THE PROGRAM IN KENTUCKY SUCCESSFULLY EXPANDED, AND AS A RESULT, A NATIONAL ARCHERY IN THE SCHOOLS PROGRAM  NASP) WAS CREATED TO GIVE OTHER STATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING A MODEL ARCHERY EDUCATION PROGRAM INTO SCHOOLS  PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES. A TWO PHASE EVALUATION FOR NASP INVOLVING A SAMPLE OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS FROM 10 STATES TEACHING THE PROGRAM INDICATED THAT 30  OF THE STUDENTS REPORTED THAT THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED IN HUNTING AND OTHER SHOOTING SPORTS SINCE TAKING THE ARCHERY PROGRAM IN SCHOOL. IN OCTOBER OF 2005, THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE  CDFW), OFFICE OF COMMUNICATION, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH  OCEO) ADOPTED THE KENTUCKY MODEL AND TRAINED 21 PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND 13 VOLUNTEER INSTRUCTORS TO IMPLEMENT NASP IN CALIFORNIA   HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS CALNASP. SUBSEQUENTLY, IN YEAR 2006, CDFW PILOTED THE CALNASP FOR ONE YEAR WITH 15 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WITH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS RANGING FROM ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, AND HIGH SCHOOLS. DURING THIS TIME, 2,135 STUDENTS WERE INTRODUCED TO ARCHERY EDUCATION  14 OUT OF THE 15 SCHOOLS INDICATED THEY WOULD CONTINUE THE PROGRAM. BY THE END OF 2007, THE CALNASP PROGRAM EXPANDED TO APPROXIMATELY 350 SCHOOLS WITH THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS LEARNING BASIC ARCHERY SKILLS. IN ADDITION TO SCHOOLS ADOPTING TARGET ARCHERY AS A TAUGHT PE CURRICULUM, SOME HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED CALNASP AS AN AFTER SCHOOL OUTDOOR CLUB IN WHICH STUDENTS CAN EXPLORE OTHER OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES WITH ARCHERY AS A COMPONENT. FURTHERMORE, CALNASP CONTINUES TO OPERATE UNDER THE AGENCY VOLUNTEER MODEL AND HAS GROWN FROM 40 VOLUNTEER INSTRUCTORS IN 2018 TO 240 IN 2023.

THE PROGRAM SET OUT TO DEVELOP A CURRICULUM IN WHICH STUDENTS WOULD RECEIVE HANDS-ON LESSONS  COVERING BASIC ARCHERY SKILLS IN SCHOOL, DURING THEIR PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES. THE LESSONS ARE TAUGHT BY  SCHOOLTEACHERS TO STUDENTS IN GRADES 4-12. THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN WILDLIFE ASSOCIATED RECREATION AND OTHER ARCHERY-RELATED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS BOW HUNTING.THE PROGRAM IN KENTUCKY SUCCESSFULLY EXPANDED, AND AS A RESULT, A NATIONAL ARCHERY IN THE SCHOOLS PROGRAM (NASP)  WAS CREATED TO GIVE OTHER STATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING A MODEL ARCHERY-EDUCATION PROGRAM INTO SCHOOLS'  PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES. A TWO-PHASE EVALUATION FOR NASP INVOLVING A SAMPLE OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS FROM 10  STATES TEACHING THE PROGRAM INDICATED THAT 30% OF THE STUDENTS REPORTED THAT THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED IN HUNTING  AND OTHER SHOOTING SPORTS SINCE TAKING THE ARCHERY PROGRAM IN SCHOOL.IN OCTOBER OF 2005, THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (CDFW), OFFICE OF COMMUNICATION, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH  (OCEO) TRAINED 21 PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND 13 VOLUNTEER INSTRUCTORS TO IMPLEMENT NASP IN CALIFORNIA -  HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS CALNASP. SUBSEQUENTLY, IN YEAR 2006, CDFW PILOTED THE CALNASP FOR ONE YEAR WITH 15  NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WITH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS RANGING FROM ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, AND HIGH SCHOOLS. DURING  THIS TIME, 2,135 STUDENTS WERE INTRODUCED TO ARCHERY EDUCATION; 14 OUT OF THE 15 SCHOOLS INDICATED THEY WOULD  CONTINUE THE PROGRAM.BY THE END OF 2007, THE CALNASP PROGRAM EXPANDED TO APPROXIMATELY 350 SCHOOLS WITH THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS LEARNING  BASIC ARCHERY SKILLS. IN ADDITION TO SCHOOLS ADOPTING TARGET ARCHERY AS A TAUGHT PE CURRICULUM, SOME HAVE ALSO  IMPLEMENTED CALNASP AS AN AFTER-SCHOOL-OUTDOOR CLUB IN WHICH STUDENTS CAN EXPLORE OTHER OUTDOOR-RECREATIONAL  ACTIVITIES WITH ARCHERY AS A COMPONENT.FURTHERMORE, CALNASP CONTINUES TO OPERATE UNDER THE AGENCY/VOLUNTEER MODEL AND HAS GROWN FROM 40 VOLUNTEER  INSTRUCTORS IN 2018 TO 240 IN 2022. THESE INSTRUCTORS ARE AVAILABLE TO TRAIN TEACHERS TO DELIVER AND GROW THE  PROGRAM ALL ACROSS THE STATE.IN THE PAST, THE PROGRAM OPERATED WITH SMALL DONATIONS FROM CONSERVATION AND ARCHERY ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER  COMMUNITY GROUPS. HOWEVER, WITH A MORE STABLE FUNDING BASE, THE PROGRAM IS NO LONGER ISOLATED TO A FEW COUNTIES;  WE ARE SEEING EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM INTO MORE COUNTIES STATEWIDE, CURRENTLY REACHING 178 COUNTIES IN  CALIFORNIA.RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT YOUTH IN THE UNITED STATES ARE INCREASINGLY DISCONNECTED FROM OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES. THROUGH  THE SUCCESS AND EXPANSION OF CALNASP WE CAN PROVIDE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN A SKILL THAT EASILY  TRANSLATES INTO AN OUTDOOR RECREATION, SUCH AS BOW HUNTING, IF THE STUDENT WISHES.
