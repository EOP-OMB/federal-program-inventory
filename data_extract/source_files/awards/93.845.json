ADVANCEMENT STRATEGY CONSULTING PROPOSES TO ACHIEVE THIS BY ESTABLISHING A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (TA) CENTER THAT WILL 1) PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE EIGHT COMPONENT 1 GRANTEES; 2) INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE IMPACT OF EVIDENCE-BASED POPULATION-LEVEL PREVENTION STRATEGIES (EBPLS); 3) INCREASE DEMAND FOR PROVISION OF TA ON IDENTIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EBPLS RELATED TO ALCOHOL USE; AND 4) INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL AND STATE ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THESE STRATEGIES. OUR VISION IS TO BRING TOGETHER MANY OF THE NATION?S LEADING ALCOHOL POLICY EXPERTS AND LEVERAGE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT RESOURCES TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE TA THROUGH MULTIPLE ACCESS POINTS TO STAKEHOLDERS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING FIVE STRATEGIES:STRATEGY 1: ASSEMBLE A TEAM WITH SUBSTANTIAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EBPLS, INCLUDING THOSE RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMUNITY PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE.STRATEGY 2: PROVIDE EXPERT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COMPONENT 1 RECIPIENTS (ALCOHOL EPIDEMIOLOGISTS) AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON TRANSLATING EBPLS INTO PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE.STRATEGY 3. CENTRALIZE AND DISSEMINATE EXISTING RESOURCES ON THE PREVENTION OF EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE TO CONNECT RECIPIENTS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH APPROPRIATE PARTNERS AND RESOURCES. STRATEGY 4: DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE NEW RESOURCES AND TOOLS FOR TRANSLATING EBPLS INTO PRACTICE.STRATEGY 5: PROVIDE TRAINING TO COMPONENT 1 RECIPIENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFECTIVE POPULATION-LEVEL STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTING EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE AND RELATED HARMS.COLLABORATION: THE ASC TEAM IS COLLABORATING WITH MANY LEADING ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPERTS ON ALCOHOL POLICY AND PREVENTION AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH MORE BROADLY. OUR APPLICATION HAS 29 LETTERS OF SUPPORT, INCLUDING 23 STATE AND LOCAL GR OUPS FROM 19 STATES.

EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT: OUR EVALUATION PLAN FOCUSES ON THE SHORT-TERM AND INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES IN THE NOTICE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY, AS WELL AS ASSESSING TA AND TRAINING PROGRAM DELIVERY. PROCESS MEASURES INCLUDED IN THE PLAN WILL PROVIDE MONITORING OF PROGRESS AGAINST STATED GOALS AND TIMELINES IN OUR WORK PLAN, ENABLING AN ONGOING REVIEW OF PROGRAM PROGRESS. ANY IDENTIFIED ISSUES WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSED. IN CONSULTATION WITH CDC, ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STAFFING PLAN AND/OR WORK PLAN WILL BE MADE AS NEEDED. PROCESS MEASURE REPORTING WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR MONTHLY AND ANNUAL REQUIRED REPORTING. AT APPROPRIATE TIMEPOINTS, OUTCOME MEASURES WILL BE ASSESSED TO PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF ACHIEVEMENT OF SHORT-TERM AND INTERMEDIATE GOALS.
