IN MANY INSTANCES, OFFICERS ENCOUNTER THE SAME INDIVIDUALS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THESE ENCOUNTERS CAN BECOME VOLATILE AT TIMES, WITH THE THREAT OF HARM TO BOTH THE OFFICER AND THE PERSON IN CRISIS. MANY CONTROVERSIAL INCIDENTS INVOLVING POLICE STARTED AS AN INCIDENT INVOLVING A PERSON WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.\nOFFICERS OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES BEING CRITICIZED FOR HANDLING SUCH INCIDENTS AS A CRIMINAL MATTER WHEN THE CONTACT SHOULD BE HANDLED AS A MENTAL HEALTH CALL. HOWEVER, OFFICERS ARE NOT PROVIDED RESOURCES OR IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO RESOURCES TO HANDLE A MENTAL HEALTH CALL BEYOND INITIATING AN EMERGENCY HOSPITALIZATION FOR A MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION UNDER A BAKER ACT. THIS CAN LEAVE A PERSON SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS DISRUPTING A COMMUNITY OR CREATE PRESSURE FOR AN OFFICER TO \u201cSOLVE THE PROBLEM.\u201d\nOFFICERS UNFORTUNATELY, BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, WILL OFTEN SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY INITIATING A BAKER ACT OF A PERSON WHO ARGUABLY DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR A BAKER ACT OR BY MAKING AN ARREST OF A PERSON WHEN THEY WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BECAUSE OF THE MINOR NATURE OF THE OFFENSE. EVEN WHEN AN OFFICER INITIATES A BAKER ACT, A PERSON SUFFERING CHRONIC MENTAL ILLNESS IS OFTEN RELEASED AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND DIRECTED TO OBTAIN FOLLOW-UP TREATMENT, THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR UP TO ONE TO TWO MONTHS. THE FOLLOW-UP TREATMENT OFTEN DOES NOT OCCUR AS THE PATIENT MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE SURE THEY SCHEDULE THE FOLLOW-UP, OR EVEN BELIEVE THEY NEED TREATMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE DUE TO THEIR STATE OF MIND. THIS DOES NOT PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE TO THE CITIZEN EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS AND ALLOWS THE ISSUE TO PERSIST WITHOUT PROPER ATTENTION.\nCPD HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF PROACTIVE COMMUNITY POLICING AND IS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE MENTALLY ILL IN CLEARWATER. CURRENTLY OVER 75% OF ALL SWORN CPD OFFICERS HAVE UNDERGONE CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING (CIT), THE CLEARWATER POLICE COMMUNICATION CENTER PERSONNEL HAVE RECEIVED CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING FOR COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS, AND THE SWORN PERSONNEL THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED CIT HAVE ALL RECEIVED MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING. THIS TRAINING HAS BEEN HELPFUL, BUT ADDITIONAL APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING CALLS INVOLVING MENTAL ILLNESS IS NECESSARY.\nIN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE A MORE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE, THE CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES THE INTRODUCTION OF A PILOT PROGRAM CO-RESPONDER MODEL THAT WILL PAIR A POLICE OFFICER UP WITH A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TO RESPOND TO CALLS WITH PERSONS IN CRISIS AND CONDUCT FOLLOW-UP WITH PERSONS EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES AROUND MENTAL HEALTH TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO CONNECT THE PERSON TO THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES.\nBACKGROUND\nACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI), ONE IN FIVE AMERICANS IS AFFECTED BY MENTAL ILLNESS IN A GIVEN YEAR. AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS IN THE MIDST OF A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WILL NO DOUBT FIND THE FIRST RESPONDER TO CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE IS A POLICE OFFICER. THESE ENCOUNTERS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES END WITH THE INDIVIDUAL BEING ARRESTED AND JAILED. THE STEPPING UP INITIATIVE, WHOSE MISSION IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES IN JAIL, ESTIMATES THAT TWO MILLION PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS ARE ADMITTED TO JAILS ACROSS THE COUNTRY EACH YEAR. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO STAY IN JAIL LONGER AND HAVE A HIGHER RATE OF BEING INCARCERATED AGAIN IN THE FUTURE THAN THOSE NOT AFFECTED BY MENTAL ILLNESS.\nACCORDING TO MIAMI-DADE COUNTY JUDGE STEVE LEIFMAN, ONE OF THE NATION\u2019S FOREMOST AUTHORITIES ON THE CRIMINALIZATION OF MENTAL ILLNESS, PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES IN THIS COUNTRY WILL BE JAILED FOUR TO EIGHT TIMES LONGER THAN SOMEONE WITHOUT A MENTAL ILLNESS. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, JAILS ARE HARDLY THE IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR ANYONE SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL ILLNESS. THE VERY NATURE OF A JAIL IS CERTAIN TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ANYONE\u2019S MENTAL HEALTH, BUT PARTICULARLY ON ONE WHO IS ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THE MENTALLY ILL IN JAIL INCLUDE OVERCROWDING, VIOLENCE, NOISE, ENFORCED SOLITUDE, LACK OF PRIVACY, LACK OF MEANINGFUL ACTIVITY, ISOLATION FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND INADEQUATE HEALTH SERVICES, ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.\nTO ADDRESS THE CALL CATEGORIES INVOLVING MENTAL ILLNESS MORE EFFICIENTLY, THE CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT PARTNERED WITH DIRECTIONS FOR LIVING IN 2018 TO CONDUCT THE PILOT PROGRAM, \u201cMENTAL HEALTH CHECK TEAM.\u201d THE PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY STRUCTURED TO FOCUS ON A SUB-GROUP OF \u201cHIGH UTILIZERS\u201d OR PERSONS THAT WERE THE SUBJECT OF FREQUENT CALLS ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. THE TEAM WAS TASKED WITH MAKING REGULAR, REOCCURRING CONTACT WITH THIS SUB-GROUP WHEN THE PERSON WAS NOT IN CRISIS TO MAKE SURE TREATMENT WAS ON-GOING, DEVELOP A RAPPORT WITH THE INDIVIDUAL, AND SEEK TO INTERVENE WHEN NECESSARY PRIOR TO A PERSON EXPERIENCING A FULL-BLOWN CRISIS.\nTHE CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT INITIALLY STRUGGLED TO IDENTIFY AND LOCATE HIGH UTILIZERS, THE HISTORICAL TIME FRAME OF THE DATA WAS TOO LONG RESULTING IN DIFFICULTY LOCATING CLIENTS. THE TEAM QUICKLY ADAPTED AND LEARNED THE DATA NEEDED TO BE ANALYZED WITH A SHORTER TIME INTERVAL, AND BE LESS HISTORICAL. DIRECTIONS FOR LIVING WAS A VIABLE PARTNER AND EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS. HOWEVER, DIRECTIONS FOR LIVING WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS CLIENT NEEDS MORE EFFICIENTLY WHEN THE CLIENT WAS A PATIENT OF DIRECTIONS FOR LIVING. THEY WERE ABLE TO ASSIST WITH NAVIGATION WHEN THE CLIENT WAS NOT A PATIENT OF DIRECTIONS FOR LIVING, BUT WITH LESS EFFICIENCY BY NO FAULT OF THE PROVIDER. ONCE THE GRANT FUNDING FOR THE PILOT WAS EXHAUSTED, THE PILOT DID NOT CONTINUE DUE TO ABOVE LISTED ISSUES.\nCURRENT SITUATION\nIN CLEARWATER, THE MENTALLY ILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT A REAL CHALLENGE FOR THE CPD AND ITS OFFICERS. MENTAL ILLNESS DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE \u2013 THE PEOPLE THAT CPD OFFICERS DEAL WITH ARE INDIVIDUALS FROM A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC, EDUCATIONAL, RACIAL, AND SOCIAL BACKGROUNDS. SADLY, CLEARWATER POLICE OFFICERS REGULARLY DEAL WITH A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF CALLS FOR SERVICE INVOLVING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IN FISCAL YEAR 2020, THE CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO \u201cAT LEAST\u201d 1,399 CALLS FOR SERVICE THAT WERE MENTAL HEALTH RELATED. AN ANALYSIS OF THE 2020 CALL DATA REVEALS THE MOST CALLS RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH ARE RECEIVED MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 8AM AND 7PM. HOWEVER, THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE THE DATA IS LIMITED.\nTHE \u201cAT LEAST\u201d REFERENCE TO THE DATA IS NECESSARY BECAUSE MANY CALLS INVOLVING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS PETTY CRIMES OR OTHER TITLES THAT ARE NOT EASILY MINED WITHOUT HAVING AN ANALYST READ EVERY POLICE CALL FOR SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, A CALL MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS A DISTURBANCE, SUSPICIOUS PERSON, TRESPASSING, OR A VARIETY OF OTHER MINOR TITLES. IN MANY OF THESE TITLES, A PERSON INVOLVED MAY NOT BE SUICIDAL OR DANGEROUS, BUT THE PERSON\u2019S BEHAVIOR MAY BE RELATED TO A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. OFFICERS NEED AN AVAILABLE RESOURCE TO CALL TO A SCENE WHEN THERE MAY BE AN UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION.\nPOLICE CONTACTS WITH PERSONS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME VOLATILE, AS THE PERSON MAY BECOME AGITATED AND RESIST ANY ATTEMPTS OF ASSISTANCE. THIS CAN RESULT IN OFFICERS NEEDING TO RESORT TO USE OF FORCE OR IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES, SWAT TEAM CALL-OUT, TO SAFELY SECURE THE INDIVIDUAL TO SUBMIT TO AN INVOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH EXAMINATION (BAKER ACT). NEITHER OF THESE OPTIONS IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF POLICE OR THE INDIVIDUAL IN CRISIS, WITH A TREMENDOUS RISK OF INJURY TO EVERYONE INVOLVED. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN APPROXIMATELY 20% OF POLICE SHOOTINGS INVOLVE A PERSON WHO HAS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. WHILE TRYING TO REDUCE THE IMPACT ON POLICE RESOURCES IS A BENEFIT THIS PROGRAM SEEKS, THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE BETTER OUTCOMES AND TO PROVIDE PROPER TREATMENT TO INDIVIDUALS TO AVOID A TRAGEDY WHEN A PERSON IS IN CRISIS.\nPROPOSAL\nTHE CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT SEEKS TO INITIATE A PILOT PROGRAM THAT PAIRS A POLICE OFFICER WITH A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL THAT IS CONTRACTED THROUGH PINELLAS COUNTY AND WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF\u2019S OFFICE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT. THE CONSTRUCT OF THIS PROGRAM THAT IS UNIQUE IS THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WILL BE A PINELLAS COUNTY EMPLOYEE AND NOT AFFILIATED WITH AN INDIVIDUAL LOCAL PROVIDER. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN AGNOSTIC APPROACH TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, ALLOWING THE PROFESSIONAL TO CONNECT A CLIENT TO A PROVIDER THAT MEETS THE SPECIFIC AND UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE CLIENT. FURTHERMORE,\nTHIS PROGRAM COLLABORATION WITH THE PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF\u2019S OFFICE WILL FUNCTIONALLY CONSOLIDATE THIS SERVICE TO AVOID CREATING ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY TO A PROVIDER SYSTEM THAT IS ALREADY UNDERFUNDED AND STRUGGLES TO MEET COMMUNITY DEMAND.\nADDITIONALLY, DUE TO THE UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITY OF OPERATING A JAIL THAT PROVIDES MEDICAL SERVICES, THE SHERIFF\u2019S OFFICE HAS MULTIPLE PARTNERSHIPS THE CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN LEVERAGE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, SUCH AS THE PINELLAS INTEGRATED CARE (PIC) TEAM WHICH ADDRESSES TREATMENT BARRIERS AND GAPS.\nTHE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES ASSIGNING TWO EXISTING OFFICER POSITIONS AND CONTRACTING THROUGH THE PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF\u2019S OFFICE FOR TWO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. EACH OFFICER WILL BE PAIRED WITH A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. THE CITY OF CLEARWATER WILL BE ASSIGNED TO THESE TWO TEAMS WITH THE AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE TEAM BEING CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT DISTRICTS I & II, AND THE OTHER TEAM BEING ASSIGNED CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT DISTRICT III. THE HOURS OF THE CO-RESPONDER TEAMS WILL BE SET FROM AN ANALYSIS OF CALL DATA BASED ON WHEN IN-PROGRESS CALLS ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE MOST FREQUENT. WHEN NOT RESPONDING TO IN-PROGRESS CALLS, THE CO-RESPONDER TEAMS WILL ASSIST AND COORDINATE FOLLOW-UP WITH PERSONS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS.\nAS PART OF THIS PILOT, THE CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT WOULD ENACT ENHANCEMENTS TO THE RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ACISS) AND TRAIN PERSONNEL TO CAPTURE CALLS INVOLVING MENTAL ILLNESS BY ADDING A NEW DATA FIELD. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR CALLS TO BE REVIEWED AND TRIAGED BY THE CO-RESPONDER TEAM. THIS WILL GUIDE FOLLOW-UP CONTACTS FOR THE TEAM TO CONDUCT WHEN NOT RESPONDING TO IN PROGRESS CALLS OR CALLS FROM OFFICERS TO RESPOND. ADDITIONALLY, OFFICERS WILL BE ABLE TO CALL THE CO-RESPONDER TEAM TO ANY CALL INVOLVING AN UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE OR UTILIZE THE REPORT WRITING SYSTEM TO MAKE REFERRALS TO THE CO-RESPONDER TEAM.\nTHE PILOT IS PROPOSED TO RUN THROUGH THE 2021 CALENDAR YEAR AT WHICH TIME THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE EVALUATED FOR PERMANENT IMPLEMENTATION. THE PROGRAM SEEKS TO PRODUCE BETTER OUTCOMES THAT REDUCE THE NEED FOR REPEAT CALLS FOR SERVICE AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TIMES STANDARD PATROL RESOURCES ARE USED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CALLS. THE PILOT ALSO SEEKS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENTERING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR REASONS RELATED TO MENTAL ILLNESS, BUT STATISTICALLY WILL BE DIFFICULT TO TRACK.\nTHE MISSION OF THIS PROJECT IS AS FOLLOWS:\nPROVIDE AN ENHANCED RESPONSE TO CALLS FOR SERVICE INVOLVING MENTAL ILLNESS AND MORE EFFICIENTLY CONNECT PERSONS NEEDING ASSISTANCE TO AVAILABLE PROGRAMS.\nTHE STRATEGIES OF THIS PROGRAM ARE AS FOLLOWS:\nPROVIDE AN ON-DUTY, CO-RESPONDER TEAM (POLICE OFFICER AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL) DURING PERIODS OF TIME WHEN MENTAL ILLNESS RELATED CALLS ARE MORE PREVALENT.\nASSIST PERSONS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS TO GET THE RIGHT LEVEL OF CARE ON A TIMETABLE THAT MEETS THE INDIVIDUAL SITUATION OF THE CLIENT.\nTHE OBJECTIVES/OUTCOME MEASURES OF THIS PROGRAM ARE AS FOLLOWS:\nOBJECTIVE: WHEN AVAILABLE, THE CO-RESPONDER UNIT WILL RESPOND AT THE REQUEST OF ON-SCENE PERSONNEL OR TO IN-PROGRESS CALLS ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS TO FACILITATE AND COORDINATE CLIENT ACCESS TO SERVICES.\nMEASURE: THE CO-RESPONDER TEAMS WILL SEEK TO HANDLE A MINIMUM OF 33% OF THE CALLS FOR SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.\nMEASURE: REVIEW 100% OF THE RECENT CLEARWATER POLICE CONTACTS WITH PERSONS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS ENTERED IN THE RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ACISS) AND EVALUATE THE NEED TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL FOLLOW-UP CONTACTS.\nMEASURE: THE CO-RESPONDER TEAM WILL SUCCESSFULLY CONNECT CLIENTS TO NEEDED SERVICES AS IDENTIFIED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL 100% OF THE TIME.\nPROGRAM EXPENSE\nTHE DEPARTMENT WOULD USE EXISTING DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL TO STAFF THE TWO OFFICER POSITIONS NECESSARY. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEGOTIATE A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF\u2019S OFFICE TO PAY FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT WOULD SERVE ALONGSIDE THE OFFICERS FOR THE CO-RESPONDER TEAM. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FUNDING TWO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IS $144,000 ($72,000 EACH).

THE 2019/2020 CONTRACT WITH THE PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF\u2019S OFFICE FOR ANCILLARY POLICE SERVICES WAS UNDERBUDGET BY $161,623, AND THE CITY OF CLEARWATER RECENTLY HAD THE UNENCUMBERED FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONTRACT RETURNED TO THE CITY OF CLEARWATER. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT REQUEST COULD BE SATISFIED UTILIZING THESE FUNDS.\nCONCLUSION\nIN TODAY\u2019S WORLD, LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVING REGULAR CONTACTS WITH PERSONS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS IS A GIVEN. IT IS NECESSARY WE PROVIDE OFFICERS WITH THE RESOURCES TO GIVE PROPER ATTENTION TO MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS BEYOND TRAINING. HELPING THOSE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS GET CONNECTED TO THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES WILL PROVIDE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR ALL INVOLVED. INSTITUTIONALIZING A CO-RESPONDER RESPONSE FOR MENTAL HEALTH RELATED CALLS IS AN EMERGING BEST PRACTICE. PARTNERING WITH THE COUNTY FOR THIS INITIATIVE WILL PROVIDE FOR THE BEST INTEGRATION WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE COMMUNITY BY NOT CREATING MULTIPLE, OVERLAPPING INITIATIVES THAT ADD MORE COMPLEXITY FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MANAGE.\nSHOULD THE CITY MANAGER AND COUNCIL APPROVE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS PILOT, THE CLEARWATER POLICE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEGOTIATE THE NECESSARY MOU WITH THE PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF\u2019S OFFICE AND CONDUCT A SELECTION PROCESS TO IDENTIFY AND TRAIN THE PERSONNEL TO FILL THE OFFICER POSITIONS.

THE FORMAL EVALUATION THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE CIRI PROJECT WOULD FILL IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS FOR PROGRAM PLANNING WITH LEARNINGS TO INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY NOT JUST IN BOULDER, BUT ACROSS THE NATION BY ADDING QUALITY RESEARCH TO THIS FIELD.

THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE TRAGIC MAR. 22, 2021 KING SOOPERS SHOOTING HAVE FURTHER INCREASED THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STRESS IN BOULDER. \n\nTHE NEED FOR ROBUST BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORT IN MANY CALLS TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS CLEAR. IN 2020, BOULDER POLICE RESPONDED TO AT LEAST 1300 CALLS FOR SERVICE THAT WERE DIRECTLY RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES.\u00a0 IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN A PRECISE NUMBER OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH-RELATED POLICE INTERACTIONS, BUT OFFICERS REPORT A CONSTANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY CONTACT THAT SUFFER FROM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.\n\nTHE COMMUNITY BENEFITS OF POLICE/BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS (ALSO KNOWN AS CO-RESPONDER PROGRAMS) SUCH AS CIRT ARE DIVERTING COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM ARREST AND HOSPITALIZATION, HELPING PEOPLE CONNECT WITH ONGOING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORTS IN THE COMMUNITY, AND HELPING IMPROVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE, PER A 2020 EVALUATION OF COLORADO\u2019S CO-RESPONDER PROGRAMS BY COLORADO HEALTH INSTITUTE.

SUSAN STEFAN\u2019S RATIONAL SUICIDE, IRRATIONAL LAWS UNDERSCORES THAT \u201cINVOLUNTARY PSYCHIATRIC DETENTION INCREASES RATHER THAN DECREASES THE RISK OF SUICIDE FOR MANY PEOPLE...IT IS NOT ONLY THAT HOSPITALIZATION IS INEFFECTIVE, BUT IN SOME CASES IT IS EXTREMELY DAMAGING...MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS BELIEVE THAT INVOLUNTARY INSTITUTIONALIZATION CAN BE A TRAUMATIZING EXPERIENCE THAT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUICIDE IN THE LONG RUN.\u201d (PP 119-120) LIVE THROUGH THIS, AN ONLINE PROJECT TO GATHER STORIES OF SUICIDE ATTEMPT SURVIVORS, DOCUMENTS THE DAMAGING EXPERIENCES OF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION, INCLUDING HERE IN COLORADO. HAVING A CO-RESPONDER WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON SCENE INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE COMMUNITY MEMBER IN CRISIS WILL BE ABLE GET SUPPORT IN THE MOMENT, ACCESS VOLUNTARY TREATMENT, AND AVOID THE TRAUMA OF AN EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT OR PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION. HAVING A CASE MANAGER CAN ALSO HELP ADDRESS QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES, SUCH AS SUPPORT IN ACCESSING BENEFITS AND HOUSING, OR FINDING WAYS TO INCREASE COMMUNITY CONNECTION. BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AFTER THE CRISIS DECREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE CRISES.\n\nSIMILAR TO NATIONWIDE TRENDS, THE BOULDER COMMUNITY HAS EXPRESSED A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN INCREASED MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING FOR POLICE OFFICERS AS WELL AS ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE CO-RESPONDER MODEL REPRESENTED IN THE CIRI PROJECT.

THE USE OF BODY CAMERAS IS ONE METHOD TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS, ALLOWING COMMUNITY TRUST TO STRENGTHEN AND TO PROVIDE AN UNBIASED REPRESENTATION OF ANY POLICE INTERACTIONS. FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD, THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE CONVENED A COMMISSION TO PROVIDE POLICE REFORM RECOMMENDATIONS: LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY, COMMUNITY & TRANSPARENCY (LEACT). ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS FOR EVERY COMMUNITY TO INSTITUTE A BODY CAMERA PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY, A SMALL TOWN LIKE GREENLAND CANNOT BEAR THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF CREATING SUCH A PROGRAM, AS THE INITIAL SET-UP OF EQUIPMENT (THE CAMERAS THEMSELVES AND A SERVER TO SAVE THE DATA) AS WELL AS COSTLY SOFTWARE THAT ALLOWS FOR REDACTION (DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS, JUVENILES, ETC.).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "498138ce-7ce6-03e1-f01d-79eaf16d2e22-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJA22GG00195BRND_1550"}, {"internal_id": 152543065, "Award ID": "15PBJA22GG00194BRND", "Award Amount": 2000000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-07-26", "CFDA Number": "16.753", "Description": "THE LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY\u2019S OFFICE (LCDAO) SEEKS $2,000,000.00 IN FUNDING THROUGH THE BJA FY 2022 BYRNE DISCRETIONARY COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING/BYRNE DISCRETIONARY GRANTS PROGRAM TO INITIATE THE GANG AND GUN REDUCTION AND INTELLIGENCE PROJECT (GGRIP) TO SERVE THE DIVERSE POPULATION OF LACKAWANNA COUNTY\u2019S 40 CITIES, TOWNSHIPS AND BOROUGHS THROUGH AGGRESSIVE INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION, INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION EFFORTS TARGETED SPECIFICALLY TOWARD GANG, GUN AND DRUG-RELATED CRIMES.\u00a0 GGRIP WILL ATTACK THE SCOURGE OF GANG, GUN, AND DRUG CRIME THROUGH A MULTI-LEVEL, COLLABORATIVE APPROACH BALANCING AGGRESSIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH PUBLIC EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS TO GAIN THE TRUST OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS AT THE HIGHEST RISK FOR VICTIMIZATION BY GANG, GUN, AND DRUG VIOLENCE AND WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE INFORMATION VALUABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.\u00a0 THE PROJECT WILL FUND THE SALARIES OF FOUR PROFESSIONALS WHO WILL DEVOTE THEIR TIME AND EFFORTS TO THE GANG, GUN AND DRUG PROBLEM SET, INCLUDING TWO DETECTIVES, A PROSECUTING ATTORNEY, AND AN ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGER.\u00a0\u00a0 FURTHER, BYRNE JAG FUNDING WILL ALLOW LCDAO TO: KEEP THE MOST CURRENT TECHNOLOGY IN THE HANDS OF DIGITAL FORENSIC EXAMINERS; MAKE CAPITAL PURCHASES TO IMPROVE OUTDATED TRANSPORTATION, SECURE COMMUNICATION, SURVEILLANCE AND EVIDENCE COLLECTION CAPABILITIES; FUND A NEW K9 DETECTIVE TRAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH MOST CURRENT PENNSYLVANIA DRUG LAW; PROVIDE A POLYGRAPHER DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORTING LACKAWANNA COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES; FUND PUBLIC EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS DESIGNED TO PREVENT GANG, GUN, AND DRUG CRIME AND ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO SHARE ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WITH POLICE; TRAIN MUNICIPAL POLICE OFFICERS IN THE DETECTION, INVESTIGATION AND PREVENTION OF GANG, GUN, AND DRUG CRIME; AND EQUIP COUNTY TASK FORCE OFFICERS WITH THE MOST CURRENT PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\nTHE PROJECT AIMS TO BRING TOGETHER DATA FROM MULTIPLE, DISPARATE COLLECTION POINTS (AMONGST THEM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES, SCHOOLS, AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS) AND SYNTHESIZE THOSE DATA INTO ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED TO PROVIDE QUANTIFIABLE, TANGIBLE RESULTS TO THE COMMUNITIES GGRIP SERVES.\u00a0 THE RESIDENTS OF LACKAWANNA COUNTY DEMAND AND DESERVE ASSURANCE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT TAKES THE BLIGHT OF GANG, GUN, AND DRUG VIOLENCE SERIOUSLY AND GGRIP WILL BE A CRUCIAL RESOURCE IN DEMONSTRATING LCDAO\u2019S COMMITMENT TO ATTACKING THIS PROBLEM IN A CONCERTED WAY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "47b3bfe4-9785-03b6-e18d-d1fa619b3e5d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJA22GG00194BRND_1550"}, {"internal_id": 152543326, "Award ID": "15PBJA22GG00193BRND", "Award Amount": 4500000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-07-26", "CFDA Number": "16.753", "Description": "IN 2016, COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF VERMONT (CCV) PARTNERED WITH VERMONT DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS (VD0C) TO EXPLORE SCOPE FOR COLLABORATION.

MANY COMMUNITIES WILL NEVER HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE DEDICATED CO-RESPONDER TEAMS. OTHERS HAVE LIMITATIONS UNDER STATE LAW, YET OTHERS DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT FACILITIES.

THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESPONSE AND INVESTIGATION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH INCIDENTS IS ASSIGNED TO OFFICERS WITHIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S PATROL DIVISION. COORDINATION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES IS ASSIGNED TO A SINGLE SERGEANT WITHIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S COMMUNITY SERVICES SECTION.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTHE POLICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S PATROL SERVICES DIVISION IS COMPRISED OF SIX SQUADS. EACH PATROL SQUAD IS MADE UP OF NO MORE THAN EIGHT OFFICERS AND TWO SUPERVISORS. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING (CIT) TO ITS OFFICERS, AND MORE THAN 70% OF STAFF HAVE RECEIVED THIS TRAINING. ALL OFFICERS RECEIVE TRAINING TO EFFECTIVELY INVESTIGATE REPORTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, BUT SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES IS RARE. A PATROL OFFICER\u2019S WORK ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE COMMUNITY GENERALLY CENTERS ON RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY INCIDENTS, SERVICE OF DETENTION ORDERS, INVESTIGATING PAST INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE, AND APPEARING AS A WITNESS FOR CRIMINAL TRIAL.\n\nTHE COMMUNITY SERVICES SERGEANT IS ASSIGNED SEVERAL OTHER DUTIES IN ADDITION TO COORDINATION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES. THESE ASSIGNMENTS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER SUPERVISION, COMMUNITY SERVICES STAFF SUPERVISION, PUBLIC INFORMATION, AND ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT\u2019S COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES SERGEANT, IN THEIR ROLE AS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES COORDINATOR, IS TASKED WITH ACTING AS A LIAISON WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SERVICES BOARD AND COORDINATING DEPARTMENT CIT TRAINING. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES SERGEANT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING ALL REPORTS OF NON-VIOLENT AND VIOLENT DOMESTIC INCIDENTS. THE REVIEW OF DOMESTIC INCIDENTS IS INTENDED TO IDENTIFY EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF VIOLENCE AND INITIATE FOLLOW UPS WITH VICTIMS TO ENSURE VICTIMS ARE AWARE OF AVAILABLE SERVICES. THESE REVIEWS AND CONTACTS ARE IMPORTANT TO MITIGATE RISK TO VICTIMS, THE COMMUNITY, AND RESPONDING POLICE OFFICERS.\n\nTHE CURRENT RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS COMMUNITY-ORIENTED OBJECTIVES RELATED TO THE RESPONSE TO MENTAL HEALTH AND DOMESTIC INCIDENTS. FIRST, EXPECTING AN EFFECTIVE REVIEW OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S DOMESTIC INCIDENT CASELOAD BY A POLICE SERGEANT THAT IS ALSO TASKED WITH SEVERAL OTHER SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITIES IS UNREASONABLE.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSECOND, A SINGLE MULTI-DISCIPLINARY SUPERVISOR CANNOT EFFECTIVELY COORDINATE THE COMPLEX RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY CONCERNS REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. THIRD, WHILE CIT TRAINING HAS PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING INCIDENTS OF USE OF FORCE WHEN OFFICERS RESPOND TO MENTAL HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED CALLS FOR SERVICE, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS MISSING OPPORTUNITIES TO CONNECT INDIVIDUALS TO SERVICES THAT MAY MITIGATE THE NEED FOR FUTURE POLICE INTERVENTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\u2019S MARCUS ALERT INITIATIVE, ESTABLISHED IN DECEMBER 2020, IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY CONSTRAINED POLICE DEPARTMENT RESOURCE DEMANDS RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH.\n\nGRANT FUNDING WILL BE USED TO CREATE A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH CASE MANAGEMENT TEAM COMPRISED OF A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AND A REASSIGNED VETERAN OFFICER MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE HIRING OF A NEW POLICE OFFICER. THE CASE MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL BE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S COMMUNITY SERVICES SECTION AND WILL REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE SERGEANT ASSIGNED TO COMMUNITY SERVICES. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL RESOLVE THE INEFFICIENCIES IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S EFFORTS TO MITIGATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENTS AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SERVICES BOARD TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. THE CASE MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE FUTURE INITIATIVES OF THE MARCUS ALERT SYSTEM. FUNDING OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL ALSO PERMIT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO FOCUS MORE OF ITS LIMITED RESOURCES ON OTHER IMPORTANT COMMUNITY SERVICES INITIATIVES.\n\nTHE MANASSAS CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS RECOGNIZED WITH ITS SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE ACCREDITATION AWARD IN NOVEMBER 2020 BY THE COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES (CALEA). THE CERTIFICATION INCLUDED AN EXCELLENCE DESIGNATION WHICH IS THE HIGHEST ACCREDITATION LEVEL ISSUED BY CALEA. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING\n\n\u00a0\n\nCOMMUNITY CONCERNS BY DEVELOPING STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COORDINATING ITS EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO COMMUNITY CONCERNS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS. LETTERS OF SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT FROM THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF MANASSAS, PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY, PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY COMMUNITY SERVICES BOARD, AND CITY OF MANASSAS SOCIAL SERVICES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS APPLICATION TO DEMONSTRATE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY COLLABORATION.

THE PHILOSOPHY OF CVM MAINTAINS THAT VIOLENCE IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR THAT CAN BE PREVENTED USING DISEASE CONTROL METHODS. VIOLENCE INTERRUPTION WORKS PRIMARILY WITH HIGH-RISK YOUTH, AGED 14 TO 25, THROUGH REGULAR INDIVIDUAL INTERACTIONS, CONFLICT MEDIATION, AND COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION. USING PROVEN PUBLIC HEALTH TECHNIQUES, THE MODEL FOCUSES TO PREVENT VIOLENCE THROUGH A THREE-PRONG APPROACH:\n\nIDENTIFICATION & DETECTION\n\nVIOLENCE INTERRUPTION IS A DATA-DRIVEN MODEL. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF STATISTICAL INFORMATION AND STREET KNOWLEDGE, STAFF IDENTIFY WHERE TO CONCENTRATE EFFORTS, FOCUS RESOURCES, AND INTERVENE IN VIOLENCE. THIS DATA GUIDES STAFF TO COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY VIOLENCE. IT PROVIDES A PICTURE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AT THE HIGHEST RISK FOR VIOLENCE AND SHOWS STAFF HOW TO INTERVENE.\n\nINTERRUPTION, INTERVENTION, & RISK REDUCTION\n\nVIOLENCE INTERRUPTION STAFF INTERVENE IN CRISES, MEDIATE DISPUTES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, AND INTERCEDE IN GROUP DISPUTES TO PREVENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE. STAFF ARE EXPERIENCED AND WELL-TRAINED PROFESSIONALS FROM THE COMMUNITIES THEY REPRESENT. THESE INDIVIDUALS MUST HAVE CREDIBILITY AND STRONG REPUTATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS IS OFTEN DUE TO HAVING SIMILAR LIVED EXPERIENCE TO THE INDIVIDUALS THEY SEEK TO WORK WITH. STAFF UNDERSTAND WHO HOLDS THE INFLUENCE IN COMMUNITIES AND WHO THEY NEED TO ENGAGE TO DE-ESCALATE SITUATIONS BEFORE AN ACT OF VIOLENCE OCCURS.\n\nMOST PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ARE BEYOND THE REACH OF TRADITIONAL SOCIAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

THESE WILL BE PEOPLE WITH EXISTING, STRONG RELATIONSHIPS IN THE PRIORITY ZIP CODES AND ARE ALREADY TRUSTED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL INSIGHTS INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SURVEY TOOLS AND FOCUS GROUP QUESTIONS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS, WE WILL SEEK TO DETERMINE WHICH FACTORS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTE TO THE RISK OR PROMOTE THE RESILIENCE OF THE COMMUNITY AS IT SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO VIOLENCE.\n\u00a0\n\nA PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH WILL BE THE FOUNDATION OF THE PLANNING PROCESS. THIS APPROACH FOCUSES ON PREVENTING VIOLENCE BEFORE IT OCCURS, WHILE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THE NEED FOR BALANCE OF EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF VIOLENCE AFTER IT HAS OCCURRED (E.G. MENTORING, MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES, CONFLICT RESOLUTION, MEDIATION AND INTERRUPTION AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS) AND REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE VIOLENCE (E.G. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, REENTRY PROGRAMS).\n\nCOMMUNITY INPUT ON THE VISION, PRINCIPLES, AND RISK AND RESILIENCE FACTORS WILL BE SOLICITED THROUGH COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS, INTERVIEWS, FOCUS GROUPS, AND SURVEYS.
