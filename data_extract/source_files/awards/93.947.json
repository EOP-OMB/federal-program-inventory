WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE OUR EXPERIENCE ASSISTING TB PROGRAMS AND CLINICIANS TO IMPLEMENT NEW TECHNOLOGY, IN A PERSONALIZED/INDIVIDUALIZED MANNER THAT BEST FITS THE NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM, CLINICIAN, AND PATIENT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AND EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING REQUIRED BY THE GRANT. WE HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE EDUCATION THAT USES THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACHES AND EXPERT MEDICAL CONSULTATION TO US TB PROGRAMS, AS WE HAVE OVER THE PAST 18 YEARS. WE WILL USE OUR PERSPECTIVE AS AN EXPERIENCED COE TO INNOVATIVELY LINK PUBLIC HEALTH-BASED TB EXPERTS WITH A RANGE OF PROVIDERS SERVING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AT-RISK FOR TB, SUCH AS REFUGEES, PLWHIV, NON-US BORN INDIVIDUALS IN SUPPORT OF CDC EFFORTS TO FOCUS ON LTBI TESTING AND TREATMENT AS A KEY COMPONENT OF TB ELIMINATION IN THE US. TO FULFILL OUR PURPOSE AS A TB CENTER OF EXCELLENCE (TB COE), THESE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES WILL ALLOW US TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING OUR GOALS. THESE OUTCOMES ARE FOCUSED AROUND TWO STRATEGIES, (1) TB KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ABILITIES: COMMUNICATION, EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND (2) TB PATIENT CARE MANAGEMENT: EXPERT MEDICAL CONSULTATION. BY THE END OF THIS PROJECT THE COE WILL ACHIEVE ALL OF THESE OUTCOMES: INCREASED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS RELATED TO TB AND LTBI PREVENTION AND CONTROL AMONG PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS; INCREASED ACCESS TO AND USE OF TB EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES; EXPANDED AVAILABILITY AND USE OF EXPERT CONSULTATIONS FOR PROVIDER NETWORKS SERVING POPULATIONS AT HIGH-RISK FOR LTBI AND TB; INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF REGIONAL AND NATIONAL TRENDS OF TB PATIENT CARE NEEDS; AND TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF TB EXPERT.

TO ASSIST CDC EFFORTS, THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO (UCSF) PROPOSES THAT THE CURRY INTERNATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS CENTER (CITC) BE SUPPORTED AS A TUBERCULOSIS CENTER OF EXCELLENCE (TB COE) TO CONTINUE TRAINING, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND EXPERT MEDICAL CONSULTATION TO THE TB HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. CITC IS CURRENTLY FUNDED BY THE CDC AS A TB COE. DURING ITS 28-YEAR HISTORY OF CREATING, ENHANCING, AND DISSEMINATING STATE-OF-THE-ART RESOURCES AND MODELS OF EXCELLENCE FOR TB CARE AND PREVENTION, CITC HAS BUILT A FOUNDATION OF STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH TB PROGRAMS, COMMUNITY PROVIDER NETWORKS, ACADEMIA, AND CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TRAINING CENTERS TO FULFILL ITS MISSION. AS A TB COE, CITC\u2019S GOAL WILL BE TO SUPPORT RENEWED MOMENTUM TOWARD TB ELIMINATION IN THE US. DURING THE AWARD PERIOD, CITC WILL FOCUS ON TWO MAJOR ACTIVITIES DEFINED IN THE NOTICE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY CDC-FRA-PS23-2301: 1) INCREASING KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND ABILITIES FOR TB AND LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION (LTBI) PREVENTION AND CONTROL THROUGH COMMUNICATION, EDUCATION AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES; AND 2) IMPROVING SUSTAINABLE, EVIDENCE-BASED TB AND LTBI CLINICAL PRACTICES AND PATIENT CARE THROUGH THE PROVISION OF EXPERT MEDICAL CONSULTATION. BY THE END OF THE PROJECT PERIOD, CITC EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES: 1) INCREASED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS RELATED TO TB AND LTBI PREVENTION AND CONTROL AMONG PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS; 2) INCREASED ACCESS TO AND USE OF TB EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES; 3) EXPANDED AVAILABILITY AND USE OF EXPERT CONSULTATIONS FOR COMMUNITY PROVIDER NETWORKS SERVING POPULATIONS AT HIGH-RISK FOR LTBI AND TB; AND 4) INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF NATIONAL TRENDS OF TB PATIENT CARE NEEDS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ACCELERATED A PRE-EXISTING EXODUS OF STAFF FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE, ACUTELY NOTED AMONG THE NURSING CADRE, UNDERSCORING THE CRUCIAL NEED FOR CAPACITY-BUILDING TO SUPPORT TB CARE AND PREVENTION. THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF TB CASES (E.G., CO-MORBIDITIES, DRUG RESISTANCE, ETC.) PRESENTS ADDITIONAL CLINICAL AND PROGRAMMATIC CHALLENGES. THE NEED IS CRITICAL FOR EXPERT CENTERS THAT WILL STRENGTHEN LOCAL CAPACITY THROUGH MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TB TRAINING, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND EXPERT CONSULTATION. THE STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN THIS PROPOSAL SERVE TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BY SUSTAINING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF TB CARE, REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES IN TARGET POPULATIONS, AND ADVANCING THE GOAL OF DOMESTIC TB ELIMINATION. CITC WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER STATE-OF-THE-ART CLINICAL AND PROGRAMMATIC TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL PRODUCTS THAT COMBINE UP-TO-DATE, EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL EXPERTISE, PROVEN METHODS OF CASE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION, AND BEST PRACTICE MODELS OF CULTURALLY-SENSITIVE, PERSON-CENTERED CARE. A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO HEALTH EDUCATION WILL GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL COURSES AND PRODUCTS, APPLYING APPROPRIATE PROCESS AND OUTCOME EVALUATION METHODS, WITH RELIANCE ON ONGOING NEEDS ASSESSMENT, COLLABORATION, AND COMMUNICATION WITH TB PROGRAMS AND PARTNERS TO GUIDE EDUCATIONAL PRIORITIES. CITC WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE EXPERT MEDICAL, NURSING, AND PROGRAMMATIC CONSULTATION SERVICES, UTILIZING A CORPS OF 33 CONSULTANTS WHO REPRESENT THE HIGHEST CALIBER OF ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL TB EXPERTISE. TRAINING PLATFORMS WILL MEET EVOLVING LEARNER STYLES WITH INCREASED RELIANCE ON DISTANCE METHODOLOGIES, USING TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE ACCESSIBILITY. CITC WILL INCREASE ITS FOCUS ON LTBI OUTREACH AND ENGAGING PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITY PROVIDERS TO ADVANCE EQUITABLE ACCESS AND QUALITY OF CARE FOR POPULATIONS AT HIGH-RISK.
