AS THE BACKBONE ORGANIZATION OF HOPE BUFFALO, WE WILL WORK ALONGSIDE A GROUP OF COMMITTED PARTNERS AND YOUTH TO ORGANIZE AND PURSUE COORDINATED ACTION TOWARD A COMMON VISION. TO DO THAT WE WILL IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE, MEDICALLY ACCURATE, AGE-APPROPRIATE, AND CULTURALLY TAILORED EVIDENCE-BASED TEEN PREGNANCY PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS AND STRATEGIES TO REDUCE TEEN PREGNANCY AND OTHER ASSOCIATED BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS. OUR COORDINATED APPROACH WILL REACH 3,000 YOUTH, AGES 10 TO 19, ANNUALLY AS WELL AS THEIR PARENTS, CAREGIVERS, AND OTHER CARING ADULTS IN SCHOOL, IN THE COMMUNITY, AND IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, TO IMPROVE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES, PROMOTE POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AND ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY FOR ADOLESCENTS, THEIR FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. LOCATED IN ERIE COUNTY, BUFFALO IS THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN NEW YORK, WITH A POPULATION OF 276,804 OF WHICH 12.4% ARE AGED 10-19 YEARS OLD (34,387 YOUTH). BUFFALO IS BROADLY DIVERSE, HAVING A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN (36.1%), HISPANIC (11.5%), ASIAN (8.6%), AND PERSONS IDENTIFYING AS ANOTHER RACE (9.6%) THAN ERIE COUNTY AS A WHOLE.

IN THE 2021-2022 SCHOOL YEAR, 78% OF THE 28,508 STUDENTS ATTENDING BUFFALO PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN GRADES K-12, WERE CONSIDERED POOR BY THE NYS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.  THE BUFFALO PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY RESULTS SHOW THAT STUDENTS REPORT INCREASED EXPERIENCE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND A NEED FOR SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED SOCIAL SUPPORT AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FURTHER, RESULTS SHOW THAT SUICIDE ATTEMPTS ARE RISING AT BOTH THE MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL LEVELS (FROM 10% TO 12% AND 8% TO 11%, RESPECTIVELY). THE PROJECT\u2019S GOAL IS TO ADVANCE EQUITY IN ADOLESCENT HEALTH (AGE 10-19) IN FIVE ZIP CODES IN BUFFALO BY LEVERAGING RELATIONSHIPS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT CULTIVATE OPTIMAL SEXUAL AND MENTAL HEALTH FOR ADOLESCENTS THROUGH AN EQUITABLE LENS.

TARGETED STRATEGIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND SERVICES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE CRUCIAL TO ADVANCING HEALTH EQUITY. ADOLESCENTS LIVING IN THE PREDOMINANTLY LATINO COMMUNITIES OF RURAL FRESNO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA FACE CONSIDERABLE HEALTH DISPARITIES DUE TO MULTIPLE SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL FACTORS, INCLUDING HIGH RATES OF POVERTY, GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION, FEW EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, LANGUAGE BARRIERS, AND LIMITED LOCAL SERVICES.

PROPOSED PROJECT: THE READY+ PROJECT BUILDS ON THE SUCCESSES AND LESSONS LEARNED OF A TPP20 TIER 1 GRANT BY CONTINUING CORE PARTNERSHIPS, EXTENDING THE REACH OF PROGRAMS TO NEW COMMUNITIES AND SETTINGS, AND EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE WITH ADDITIONAL EBPS THAT PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH, POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AND FAMILY COMMUNICATION. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL IMPLEMENT EBPS THAT ADDRESS SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIORS TO ADOLESCENTS IN SCHOOLS, JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITIES, AND COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS. WE WILL PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY EBPS TO ADOLESCENTS THAT ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH AND POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND TO PARENTS/CAREGIVERS THAT ADDRESS FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS. WE WILL PROVIDE A SUPPLEMENTARY CURRICULUM TO OLDER ADOLESCENTS THAT REINFORCES CONTENT ON SEXUAL HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH, AND PREPARATION FOR ADULTHOOD. THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT, WE WILL CONVENE A YOUTH ADVISORY COUNCIL AND A COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK, ADVICE, AND SUGGESTIONS ON THE DESIGN AND SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES. THIS MULTIPRONGED APPROACH AIMS TO STIMULATE SUSTAINABLE AND INNOVATIVE CHANGE IN RURAL FRESNO COUNTY AND, IF SUCCESSFUL, PROVIDE A MODEL FOR OTHER RURAL COMMUNITIES.

FIRST, RIDOH WILL IMPLEMENT GRANT ACTIVITIES CENTERED AROUND EQUITY USING A THEORY-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING, EXPLORING, AND ADDRESSING INDIVIDUAL- FAMILY- COMMUNITY- AND SYSTEM-LEVEL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO TEEN PREGNANCY.  SECOND, RIDOH WILL ENHANCE AND EVALUATE SYSTEMS SUPPORTING ADOLESCENT HEALTH, SPECIFICALLY TO REDUCE RISK AND PREVENT TEEN PREGNANCY.

HOME TO APPROXIMATELY 58,054 PEOPLE, KALIHI IS A NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE EASTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN HONOLULU. KALIHI HAS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF IMMIGRANT AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE NHOPI. ALTHOUGH THE STATE OF HAWAII\u2019S TEEN BIRTH RATE IS LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, NHOPI AND LGBTQ+ YOUTH IN KALIHI EXPERIENCE TEEN BIRTH AND HIV/STI INCIDENCE RATES TWO-TO FOUR-TIMES HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THERE ARE MANY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO ADOLESCENT HEALTH DISPARITIES IN KALIHI, INCLUDING A LACK OF ACCESS TO EBPS; NHOPI AND LGBTQ+ DISCRIMINATION IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM; HIGH RATES OF POVERTY AND UNINSURED FAMILIES; AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE NHOPI POPULATION THAT INFLUENCE ATTITUDES TOWARD SEXUALITY.

PPGNHAIK\u2019S EDUCATION STAFF WILL ALSO DIRECTLY IMPLEMENT EBPS FOR YOUTH AND FAMILIES IN AFTERSCHOOL AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS. THIS MULTIFACETED APPROACH OF REPLICATING EBPS IN MULTIPLE SETTINGS WILL ENSURE THE KYSH PROJECT CASTS A WIDE NET AND REACHES AS MANY NHOPI AND LGBTQ+ YOUTH AND FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE. SHORT-TERM PROJECT OUTCOMES WILL BE AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; IMPROVED FAMILY COMMUNICATION ABOUT SEX; LOWER RATES OF SEXUAL RISK TAKING; AND HIGHER RATES OF SEXUAL HEALTH CARE ACQUISITION. THE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE KYSH PROJECT WILL BE LOWER RATES OF TEEN PREGNANCY AND HIV/STI INCIDENCE AMONG KAHILI\u2019S NHOPI AND LGBTQ+ POPULATIONS.
