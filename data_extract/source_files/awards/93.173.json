MEMORY FORMATION INVOLVES PROCESSING, AND CONSTRUCTING INTERPRETATIONS OF THE INCOMING INFORMATION IN OUR DAILY LIVES AND IS ONE OF THE FIRST FUNCTIONS COMPROMISED IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. WITH POPULATION AGING, WE FACE A \u201cCOGNITIVE TSUNAMI\u201d OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITH MEMORY DISORDERS. THUS, UNDERSTANDING NEURAL MECHANISMS OF MEMORY, AND FINDING INTERVENTIONS THAT ENHANCE THESE PROCESSES IS A CRITICAL ENDEAVOR WITH THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF COUNTLESS PEOPLE WORLD-WIDE.  ALTHOUGH IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT MEMORY IS CRITICAL FOR COGNITIVE WELL-BEING, AND SLEEP IS CRITICAL FOR MEMORY CONSOLIDATION, THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS IN THE HUMAN BRAIN ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. RESEARCH ON MEMORY AND SLEEP SO FAR HAS SUFFERED FROM A GAP BETWEEN NON-INVASIVE COGNITIVE RESEARCH IN HUMANS AND DETAILED ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ANIMALS. MOREOVER, MOST HUMAN STUDIES ARE DOMINATED BY STIMULUS RESPONSE METHODOLOGIES WHERE THE PRESENTED STIMULI CONSTITUTE LIMITED, DISCRETIZED, ASPECTS OF MEMORY. THIS APPROACH, ALBEIT WELL-CONTROLLED, IS FAR FROM THE RICH NARRATIVE OF EPISODES WE EXPERIENCE. THUS, TO MECHANISTICALLY PROBE HUMAN MEMORY CONSOLIDATION, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO (A) EMPLOY METHODOLOGIES THAT INCORPORATE THE CONTINUOUS AND MULTIMODAL NATURE OF EXPERIENCE; (B) IDENTIFY RELEVANT NEURAL ACTIVATION PATTERNS AND HOW THEY ARE TRANSFORMED AND REACTIVATED DURING SLEEP; (C) ESTABLISH MEANS TO CAUSALLY MODULATE MEMORY PROCESSES DURING SLEEP.  BUILDING UPON OUR EXPLORATORY U01 PROJECT, THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS A BREAKTHROUGH IN OUR UNDERSTANDING BY GOING BEYOND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART, AND VIA THE APPLICATION OF INTEGRATIVE AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES. IT CAPITALIZES ON A HIGHLY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO RECORD AND MODULATE NEURONAL ACTIVITY OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SINGLE NEURONS AND NEURONAL ASSEMBLIES IN THE HUMAN BRAIN. IN PARALLEL, IT EXPLOITS THE HIGH DIMENSIONALITY OF THE DATA AS AN ASSET THROUGH THE USE OF CUTTING-EDGE DEEP LEARNING (DL) ALGORITHMS, WHICH HAVE EMERGED AS PROMISING ANALYSIS TOOLS. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE PRESENCE, AND DECODING, OF DISTRIBUTED NEURAL PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH MEMORY FOR DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF EXPERIENCE DURING WAKEFULNESS AND IDENTIFY THEIR REACTIVATION DURING SLEEP. THE PROPOSAL AIMS TO SELECTIVELY MODULATE MEMORY VIA APPLICATION OF NOVEL CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION IN SLEEP IN CONCERT WITH THE DL MODEL PREDICTIONS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS PROJECT IS POISED TO SHED LIGHT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP AND MEMORY, AND ITS MODULATION FROM A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE. SUCH AN AMBITIOUS GOAL CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH UNRIVALED COMBINATION OF EXPERIENCE, ACCESS TO A CLINICAL SETTING, AND INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIONS SUCH AS THOSE PROPOSED IN THIS PROJECT.

MYCOBACTERIUM INFECTION - PROJECT SUMMARY ORC-13661 IS A NEW CHEMICAL ENTITY BEING DEVELOPED TO PREVENT HEARING LOSS IN PATIENTS EXPOSED TO AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS (AGS). AGS ARE AN IMPORTANT CLASS OF BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE AGAINST GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA AND MYCOBACTERIA. UNFORTUNATELY, AS MANY AS 20% OF PATIENTS ADMINISTERED PARENTERAL AGS FOR OVER 5 DAYS SUFFER PERMANENT, MEASURABLE HEARING LOSS, AS DO UPWARDS OF 60% OF PATIENTS ON LONG TERM THERAPY. LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE OTOTOXIC SIDE EFFECTS, AGS ARE CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED ONLY FOR LIFE THREATENING SITUATIONS OR WHERE THEY ARE THE ONLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO FDA APPROVED DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PREVENT ANY FORM OF SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS. PREVENTING AG-INDUCED HEARING LOSS WOULD BE OF ENORMOUS BENEFIT PATIENTS CURRENTLY BEING TREATED WITH AGS. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THIS INEXPENSIVE AND EFFECTIVE BUT UNDERUSED CLASS OF ANTIBIOTICS TO BE USED MORE ROUTINELY. ORAL ORC-13661WAS DEVELOPED FROM A SMALL MOLECULE SCREEN AIMED FINDING A WAY TO MITIGATE AG-INDUCED HAIR CELL TOXICITY. IT IS ROBUSTLY EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING HEARING LOSS IN RATS TREATED WITH PROLONGED HIGH DOSE AGS. ORC-13661 HAS COMPLETED NONCLINICAL EVALUATION AND PHASE 1 TESTING IN NORMAL HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. PULMONARY AND DISSEMINATED NON-TUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA (NTM) INFECTIONS ARE CHRONIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT DEVELOP PROGRESSIVELY OVER TIME, AND REQUIRE PROLONGED PARENTERAL AG THERAPY TO ACHIEVE CONTROL OR A CURE. CURRENT GUIDELINES RECOMMEND PARENTERAL AMINOGLYCOSIDE (AG) THERAPY, USUALLY A 90 DAY COURSE OF AMIKACIN, FOR PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DISEASE, PARTICULARLY BRONCHIECTASIS.

HEARING LOSS (ARHL) AFFLICTS GREATER THAN 50% OF THE POPULATION OVER THE AGE OF 70. THE PROGRESSIVE LOSS OF SENSORY HAIR CELLS (HCS) OF THE COCHLEA, PRIMARILY THE OUTER HCS (OHCS), IS EITHER THE CAUSE OR THE FINAL COMMON PATHOLOGY OF MOST FORMS OF ARHL. HOWEVER, THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF ARHL IS UNKNOWN, IMPEDING DEVELOPMENT OF TARGETED INTERVENTIONS. FURTHERMORE, ATTEMPTS TO REPROGRAM PROGENITOR CELLS TOWARDS COCHLEAR HC FATES RESULT PRIMARILY IN IMMATURE HC-LIKE CELLS, SIMILAR TO VESTIBULAR HCS. FOR THESE REASONS, THE STUDY OF THE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS UNDERLYING OHC DIFFERENTIATION AND SURVIVAL IS CRITICAL.  TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS (TFS) ARE KEY REGULATORS OF GENE EXPRESSION. WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE, IDENTIFYING THE UPSTREAM REGULATORS AND DOWNSTREAM TARGETS OF A TF IS AN EFFECTIVE ROUTE TO DETERMINE ADDITIONAL KEY PLAYERS IN THE SAME PROCESS. IN THIS COMPETITIVE RENEWAL WE BUILD UPON OUR PREVIOUS SUCCESS, IDENTIFYING CRITICAL ROLES FOR THE RFX AND IKZF2 TFS IN OHC DIFFERENTIATION, FUNCTION AND SURVIVAL, AND FOLLOW UP WITH TWO SPECIFIC AIMS DESIGNED TO ELUCIDATE THEIR MOLECULAR MECHANISM WITHIN THE HC/OHC GENETIC PROGRAMS:  GROUP 1 RFX TFS (RFX1/2/3), ARE MASTER REGULATORS OF CILIOGENESIS. HOWEVER, WHILE OHCS LACKING RFX1/3 DIE WITHIN 12 HOURS FROM THE ONSET OF HEARING, THEY HAVE NORMAL BUNDLE DEVELOPMENT. RFX2 IS TRANSIENTLY EXPRESSED IN THE DEVELOPING HCS, POSSIBLY PREVENTING A CILIOGENESIS DEFECT WITH LOSS OF RFX1/3. WE THEREFORE HYPOTHESIZE THAT GROUP 1 RFX TFS HAVE A DUAL ROLE IN HC DEVELOPMENT, WITH AN EARLY ROLE IN HAIR BUNDLE FORMATION, AND LATER ROLE IN TERMINAL DIFFERENTIATION AND SURVIVAL. SPECIFIC AIM 1: TO IDENTIFY THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH RFX TFS SUPPORT EMBRYONIC AS WELL AS EARLY POST-NATAL COCHLEAR HAIR CELL DIFFERENTIATION.  IKZF2 IS A KEY REGULATOR OF OHC GENE EXPRESSION, PRECISELY REGULATED TO EXPRESS ONLY IN OHCS STARTING FROM P4. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT: (1) DELETION OF IKZF2 TARGET GENES WILL REVEAL GENES ESSENTIAL FOR OHC FUNCTION AND SURVIVAL; (2) IKZF2 IS REQUIRED FOR MAINTENANCE OF MATURE OHCS; AND (3) IKZF2 EXPRESSION IS REGULATED BY A MASTER-REGULATOR OF OHC MATURATION. SPECIFIC AIM 2: TO IDENTIFY THE MECHANISM BY WHICH IKZF2 LEADS TO OHC DIFFERENTIATION, TO DETERMINE ITS ROLE IN MATURE OHCS, AND TO IDENTIFY ITS UPSTREAM REGULATORY NETWORK.  TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS WE COMBINE NOVEL PROTOCOLS FOR OHC-SPECIFIC MULTI-OMIC ANALYSES WITH STATE- OF-THE-ART BIOINFORMATICS, AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NOVEL MOUSE MODELS TO VALIDATE THE ROLES OF CANDIDATE GENES IN HEARING. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL: (1) IMPACT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OHC DIFFERENTIATION AND SURVIVAL; (2) FUNCTIONALLY CHARACTERIZE THE ROLES OF KEY RFX AND IKZF2 TARGET GENES IN HEARING; (3) RESULT IN TRANSCRIPTOMIC AND EPIGENETIC MAPS OF DIFFERENTIATING AND MATURE OHCS WHICH WILL BE APPLIED TO INFORM STUDIES FOR HC REGENERATION/IDENTIFYING CANDIDATE GENES FOR ARHL; AND (4) GENERATE NUMEROUS MOUSE MODELS FOR RFX AND IKZF2 TARGET GENES, WHICH WILL BE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES TO EDUCATIONAL, HEALTHCARE, AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS; AND (4) LACK OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION IN THE PROFESSION INCLUDING IN RESEARCH PROTOCOLS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICES TO UNDER-SERVED COMMUNITIES. THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS SUPPORT FOR FOUR PREDOCTORAL STUDENTS TO PARTICIPANT IN A TRANSLATIONAL AND INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING PROGRAM THAT DRAWS ON FACULTY FROM THE DEPARTMENTS OF COMMUNICATION SCIENCES AND DISORDERS, PSYCHOLOGY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS, AND MEDICINE AND LEVERAGES THE RESOURCES AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE AT VANDERBILT (E.G., VANDERBILT INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH, THE IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE CORE, THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY). VANDERBILT IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED FOR THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AS IT IS A RECOGNIZED LEADER THE FIELDS OF CSD, TRANSLATIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH, AND HEALTH EQUITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS TRAINING GRANT IS TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR INDEPENDENT SCHOLARSHIP IN TRANSLATIONAL AND INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH. TRAINEES TAKE FORMAL COURSEWORK ACROSS DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES, INCLUDING INSTRUCTION IN QUANTITATIVE METHODS, GAIN HANDS ON EXPERIENCE WITH MULTIPLE METHODOLOGIES, COMPLETE A COLLABORATIVE-INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH ROTATION (SPANNING TWO OR MORE APPROACHES), IN ADDITION TO WORKING IN THE LAB OF THEIR PRIMARY ADVISOR. TRAINEES HAVE ACCESS TO A NUMBER OF RESEARCH PROGRAMS INCLUDING IN AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE, PEDIATRIC AUDIOLOGY, COCHLEAR IMPLANTS, LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT AND DISORDERS, LANGUAGE NEUROSCIENCE AND REHABILITATION, PSYCHOLINGUISTICS, DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS AND DISABILITY, COGNITIVE- COMMUNICATION DISORDERS, COMMUNITY HEALTH, GENETICS, READING AND READING DISORDERS, ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURY, HEARING AND HEARING AIDS, MOTOR SPEECH, VOICE, AND FLUENCY. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE ANIMAL MODELS (E.G., MONKEY, MICE, RABBIT), NEUROIMAGING (E.G., MRI/FMRI, DTI, FNIRS, EEG/ERP), PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT (E.G., HEART RATE, RESPIRATION, SKIN CONDUCTANCE), COMPUTATIONAL MODELING, EYE-TRACKING, NEUROPSYCHOLOGY, LESION METHOD, VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS, ELECTROMAGNETIC ARTICULOGRAPHY, AND ADVANCED STATISTICAL APPROACHES. STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN EXPANDED TRAINING IN RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH, REPLICATION AND REPRODUCIBILITY, SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION AND GRANT WRITING, JOURNAL CLUBS, AND RESEARCH COLLOQUIA. KEY OUTCOMES INCLUDE SUBMISSION OF PEER-REVIEWED MANUSCRIPTS, APPLICATION FOR EXTERNAL RESEARCH FUNDING (E.G., NIH NRSA F31), PARTICIPATION IN NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS, AND EVENTUALLY, EMPLOYMENT AT A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY.

FIRST, CONDUCTING RIGOROUS BRAIN & LANGUAGE RESEARCH REQUIRES A BROAD CONCEPTUAL AND TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE SPANNING SEVERAL DISCIPLINES. SECOND, TO IDENTIFY RESEARCH QUESTIONS THAT WILL MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN CLINICAL CARE, BRAIN & LANGUAGE RESEARCHERS NEED CLINICAL EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND HOW COMMUNICATION DISORDERS ARE DIAGNOSED AND TREATED. THIRD, TO HAVE A CAREER THAT HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON SOCIETY, BRAIN & LANGUAGE RESEARCHERS MUST UNDERSTAND THE REAL-WORLD RELEVANCE OF THEIR RESEARCH, WHICH REQUIRES ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THEIR RESEARCH. FOURTH, A SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH CAREER REQUIRES MANY PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND A STRONG KNOWLEDGE OF ETHICAL PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING THOSE SPECIFIC TO BRAIN & LANGUAGE RESEARCH. FINALLY, BECAUSE BRAIN & LANGUAGE IS FUNDAMENTALLY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD, TRAINEES REQUIRE A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS TO FOSTER COLLABORATIONS AND CONNECTIONS THAT THEY CAN CARRY FORWARD INTO THEIR CAREERS. WE AIM TO PROVIDE THESE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF TRAINING. GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY IS IDEALLY SUITED TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS IN BRAIN & LANGUAGE RESEARCH. GEORGETOWN HAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE BRAIN & LANGUAGE FACULTY WHO STUDY A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS. THESE FACULTY INCLUDE LEADING FIGURES IN THE FIELD OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, ALONG WITH RISING STARS OF THE PRESENT. THE FACULTY HAVE A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF PRODUCTIVITY, COLLABORATION, FUNDING, AND MENTORSHIP. OUR TRAINEES ARE DIVERSE, COMPETITIVE, AND ENGAGED, AND HAVE GONE ON TO PRODUCTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH CAREERS. GEORGETOWN FACULTY ALSO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN THE WASHINGTON, DC REGION, PROVIDING A WEALTH OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR CLINICAL EXPERIENCE, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. WITHIN THIS EXTRAORDINARY ENVIRONMENT, WE AIM TO ESTABLISH A NEW BRAIN & LANGUAGE TRAINING PROGRAM (BLTP) TO PROVIDE A UNIQUE TRAINING EXPERIENCE FOR PREDOCTORAL AND POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS PURSUING CAREERS IN BRAIN & LANGUAGE NEUROSCIENCE. TO ADDRESS THE CAREER NEEDS IDENTIFIED ABOVE, THE BLTP WILL PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED TRAINING PROGRAM, INCLUDING: (1) A CURRICULUM OF COURSEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A STRONG CROSS-DISCIPLINARY CONCEPTUAL AND TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE; (2) CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH COMMUNICATION DISORDERS TO HELP TRAINEES UNDERSTAND THE CLINICAL IMPACT OF THEIR RESEARCH; (3) COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO FOSTER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW RESEARCH IMPACTS THE COMMUNITY; (4) TRAINING IN THE PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND ETHICAL PRACTICES NECESSARY FOR A SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH CAREER; AND (5) AN INTERDISCIPLINARY AND DIVERSE COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS FOCUSED ON BRAIN & LANGUAGE RESEARCH.

USERS ARE TYPICALLY ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONVERSATIONS IN QUIET ENVIRONMENTS. HOWEVER, WHEN MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE TALKING SIMULTANEOUSLY, SUCH AS AT A LARGE FAMILY DINNER OR IN A RESTAURANT, CI USERS HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY PARTICIPATING IN CONVERSATIONS AND FREQUENTLY WITHDRAW OR AVOID THE SITUATION. IDEALLY, CI ALGORITHMS TO REMOVE BACKGROUND TALKERS (\u201cBABBLE\u201d) FROM THE SIGNAL WILL ALLOW FOR IMPROVED COMPREHENSION AND CONVERSATIONAL ENGAGEMENT. ALTHOUGH CIS INCORPORATE NOISE REDUCTION (NR) ALGORITHMS, THESE ALGORITHMS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE WHEN THE BACKGROUND IS BABBLE. SEPARATING BABBLE FROM A FOREGROUND TALKER POSES TWO SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. FIRST, THE SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNAL AND NOISE ARE EXTREMELY SIMILAR AS BOTH ARE SPEECH. SECOND, THE SPECTRAL AND TEMPORAL PROPERTIES OF MULTI-TALKER BABBLE CHANGE WITH TIME AND ARE THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.  DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES, WE DEVELOPED AN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE ALGORITHM CALLED SEDA TO REMOVE BABBLE. SEDA IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF SPEECH IN BABBLE AT ALL SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS (SNRS) TESTED BY AN AVERAGE OF 26 PERCENTAGE POINTS (OR 38 POINTS, WHEN NORMALIZED WITH RESPECT TO HEARING IN QUIET). IN CONTRAST, A COMMERCIAL NR ALGORITHM (CLEARVOICE FROM ADVANCED BIONICS) PROVIDED LITTLE TO NO DETECTABLE BENEFIT.  IN A SUCCESSFUL PHASE 2, WE PRODUCED A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF SEDA. NEVERTHELESS, SIGNIFICANT WORK IS REQUIRED TO BRING SEDA TO COMMERCIAL READINESS. THE AIMS BELOW WERE DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CI MANUFACTURERS TO FACILITATE SEDA TECHNOLOGY FOR LICENSING BY CI MANUFACTURERS.  AIM 1: EVALUATE SEDA IN NON-BABBLE LISTENING SITUATIONS. AT MINIMUM, SEDA MUST BE BENEFICIAL WITH BABBLE AND NOT DETRIMENTAL IN OTHER LISTENING SITUATIONS IF IT IS TO BE COMMERCIALLY IMPLEMENTED INTO A CI. THEREFORE, WE WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF SEDA IN NON-BABBLE AUDITORY SCENES USING SPEECH RECOGNITION, LISTENER PREFERENCE, AND A COMPUTATIONAL METRIC.  AIM 2: INTERROGATE BENEFITS OF SEDA RELATIVE TO COMMERCIAL OFFERINGS FROM CI MANUFACTURERS. WE WILL COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SEDA WITH NR FROM ADVANCED BIONICS, MED-EL, COCHLEAR, AND OTICON MEDICAL ON UNDERSTATING SPEECH IN BABBLE, WHITE, AND SPEECH-SHAPED NOISE.  AIM 3: OBTAIN REAL-WORLD FEEDBACK FROM AT HOME EVALUATIONS OF SEDA. WE WILL SEND PATIENTS HOME FOR A MONTH WITH SEDA TO COLLECT FEEDBACK AND TO ASCERTAIN UNEXPECTED ISSUES OR LISTENING SITUATIONS TO BE ADDRESSED.  AIM 4: QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTATIONAL TRADE-OFFS ON SEDA PERFORMANCE. WE WILL MODIFY THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS USED IN SEDA TO ADJUST THE COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.

A NONSURGICAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE EXISTING PROCEDURE THAT CAN REDUCE PROCEDURE TIME AND MORBIDITIES WOULD BE OF ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO PATIENTS, OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS, AND PAYORS ALIKE.

OME CAN CAUSE CONDUCTIVE HEARING LOSS (CHL), BUT HEARING STATUS VARIES SUBSTANTIALLY FROM NORMAL HEARING TO MODERATE HEARING LOSSES (0-55 DB HL), AND EPISODES OF OME CAN LAST FOR VARIABLE LENGTHS OF TIME. CLINICAL EQUIPOISE EXISTS AS TO WHETHER TO TREAT OME (I.E., SURGICAL TUBE PLACEMENT) OR WAIT FOR IT TO RESOLVE SPONTANEOUSLY. WHILE THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SURGERY IN YOUNG CHILDREN, WAITING FOR OME TO RESOLVE SPONTANEOUSLY MAY ALSO CARRY RISKS. OME HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM DEFICITS IN SPEECH, LANGUAGE, AND AUDITORY PROCESSING. HOWEVER, FINDINGS FROM CLINICAL STUDIES ARE VARIABLE, RESULTING IN A PERSISTENT DEBATE REGARDING THE LONG-TERM SEQUELAE OF OME. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A KEY RISK FACTOR FOR LONG-TERM DEFICITS IS THE CUMULATIVE AUDITORY DEPRIVATION ASSOCIATED WITH OME-RELATED CHL, NOT BY THE PRESENCE OF OME ITSELF. IF THIS IS THE CASE, ONLY A SUBSET OF CHILDREN WITH OME (THOSE WITH NOTABLE HEARING LOSSES) WOULD BE AT RISK OF LONG-TERM DEFICITS. AS SUCH, IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE DETERMINE THE HEARING STATUS OF ALL CHILDREN WITH OME AS WELL AS UNDERSTAND THE VARIABILITY IN THE EFFECTS OF THIS HEARING LOSS ON LONG-TERM OUTCOMES AS A FUNCTION OF THE DEGREE AND SYMMETRY OF THE LOSS. WHILE CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS CAN OFTEN INDICATE THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF OME, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS IN OUR ABILITY TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE, DEGREE, AND SYMMETRY OF THE CHL ASSOCIATED WITH OME DUE TO THE CHALLENGES WITH BEHAVIORAL AUDIOLOGICAL TESTING IN YOUNG CHILDREN, AND NO OBJECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO BEHAVIORAL TESTING CURRENTLY EXISTS. FURTHER, EVEN IN CASES WHERE HEARING STATUS CAN BE DETERMINED BEHAVIORALLY, DETERMINATION OF HEARING AT ONE TIME POINT DOES NOT INDICATE THE STABILITY OF HEARING THRESHOLDS OR THE RISK AND MAGNITUDE OF LONG-TERM DEFICITS. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO ADDRESS THESE KNOWLEDGE GAPS COMPREHENSIVELY TO REFINE CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES BY IDENTIFYING CHILDREN MOST AT RISK FOR LONG-TERM DEFICITS TO IMPROVE TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS.

IN AIM 3, WE WILL DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF OME-RELATED VARIATIONS IN CHL AND MIDDLE- EAR MECHANICS ON INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN BINAURAL PROCESSING. COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL ACHIEVE A FIRST STEP TOWARD OUR LONG-TERM GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF OME AND DEVELOPING TOOLS TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN MOST AT RISK FOR NEGATIVE SEQUELAE BY BOTH IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE PROGNOSIS AND HEARING STATUS OVER TIME AND IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY IN LONG- TERM OUTCOMES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NE", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "52560abd-c1ee-7f8e-703c-3a52a8597b20-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DC021320_7529"}, {"internal_id": 162138272, "Award ID": "R56DC021174", "Award Amount": 661734.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-08-04", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "EMERGE: EARLY MARKERS OF EXPRESSIVE AND RECEPTIVE (LANGUAGE) GROWTH IN ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AUTISTIC TODDLERS - PROJECT ABSTRACT THE MAJORITY OF 18-24-MONTH-OLD AUTISTIC CHILDREN HAVE NO WORDS, DEMONSTRATING SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THEIR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT, A LEADING SOURCE OF CONCERN THAT OFTEN BRINGS THEM TO THE ATTENTION OF PHYSICIANS OR OTHER PROFESSIONALS IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS91,92.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY COCHLEAR STRESS BEFORE IRREVERSIBLE TISSUE DAMAGE AND HEARING LOSS HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED. THUS, THERE IS THUS AN URGENT NEED FOR DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR DETECTING EARLY COCHLEAR STRESS AND DAMAGE. MAMMALIAN HEARING REQUIRES MECHANICAL AMPLIFICATION OF SOUND BY OHCS TO PRODUCE HIGH SENSITIVITY AND SHARP FREQUENCY SELECTIVITY. OHCS ARE ALSO THE MOST VULNERABLE COMPONENTS IN THE COCHLEA, AND ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO AND OFTEN DAMAGED FROM DIFFERENT ASSAULTS THAT CAUSE OVERLOADED CA2+ AND REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS) IN OHCS.

WE WILL ALSO USE AN IN VIVO MOUSE PREPARATION TO RECORD RESPONSE PROPERTIES OF VESTIBULAR NERVE AFFERENTS ALONG WITH OPTICAL STIMULATION OF CHOLINERGIC FIBERS/ GABAERGIC CELLS AND APPLICATION OF AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS OF SPECIFIC RECEPTORS IN THE INNER EAR. FINALLY, WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF THESE DRUGS ON VESTIBULAR FUNCTION IN ALERT MICE BY MEASURING THE VESTIBULO-OCULAR REFLEX. RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO CORRELATE CHANGES AT THE LEVEL OF SINGLE SYNAPSES IN THE END ORGANS, TO VESTIBULAR NERVE ACTIVITY, AND BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THESE STUDIES IS TO PAVE THE WAY FOR FINDING NEW TREATMENT OPTIONS THROUGH LOCAL APPLICATION OF DRUGS INTO THE EAR TO IMPROVE VESTIBULAR COMPENSATION IN PATIENTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f94a8263-c1eb-718b-03c5-bb8a878692fd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DC019380_7529"}, {"internal_id": 138795840, "Award ID": "R56DC019282", "Award Amount": 685236.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-26", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "BRAIN PLASTICITY AND CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES OF ADULT-ONSET ASYMMETRIC HEARING LOSS - PROJECT SUMMARY PERMANENT SENSORINEURAL ASYMMETRIC HEARING LOSS (AHL) DISRUPTS EXTRACTION OF INTERAURAL INFORMATION FOR BINAURAL PROCESSING.

SELECTIVE COCHLEAR SYNAPTOPATHY AMONG DIFFERENT SUBTYPES OF SGNS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A MAIN MECHANISM OF HEARING LOSS, ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF WHICH IS NOISE-INDUCED HEARING LOSS (NIHL). COCHLEAR SYNAPSES FROM SGNS OF THE LOW SPONTANEOUS RATE/HIGH THRESHOLD SUBTYPE ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE AND CAN BE PREFERENTIALLY DAMAGED BY EVEN MODERATE NOISE INSULT, WHICH ARE LIKELY THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE PERCEPTUAL DEFICIT, ESPECIALLY DURING HIDDEN HEARING LOSS.

OUR OVERALL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AN SYNAPSES FROM DIFFERENT SUBTYPES OF SGNS HAVE UNIQUE SYNAPTIC PROPERTIES, TARGET DISTINCT POPULATIONS OF CN NEURONS THAT ARE DEDICATED TO PROCESSING DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF SOUND INFORMATION, AND SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SYNAPTOPATHY DURING NIHL THAT LEAD TO DISTINCTIVE CENTRAL AUDITORY PROCESSING DEFICITS AMONG ASSOCIATED CN NEURONS.

A MORE COMMONLY USED METHOD GLOBALLY IS THE SPATIAL PROTECTIVE EFFECT FROM LOW DOSE PYRETHROID INSECTICIDES EMITTED FROM HEATED DISPENSERS. HOWEVER, THE RAPID SPREAD OF PYRETHROID RESISTANCE IN MOSQUITOES IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN. IN A RECENT BREAKTHROUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP A MACHINE LEARNING CHEMINFORMATIC METHOD TO PREDICT NEW REPELLENT ODORANTS AND NEW PYRETHROID-LIKE MOLECULES FROM IN SILICO SCREENING OF >10 M COMPOUNDS. IN VALIDATING THEM IN BEHAVIOR ASSAYS, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL POWERFUL REPELLENTS FROM NATURAL SOURCES INCLUDING COMPOUNDS FOUND IN FOOD AND FLAVORING. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A COUPLE OF LEADS FOR NEW PYRETHROIDS, WHICH APPEAR TO BE UP AS EFFECTIVE AS ALLETHRIN AT A 100 X LOWER CONCENTRATION. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IN 4 AIMS IS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST-IN-CLASS INSECT REPELLENT COMPOUNDS AND UTILIZE THEM TO CREATE TWO TYPES OF POWERFUL BROAD-SPECTRUM BLENDS: A TOPICAL THAT PROTECTS FOR LONGER AT A LOW CONCENTRATION AND A SPATIAL FORMULATION THAT IS MORE EFFECTIVE AGAINST KNOCKDOWN RESISTANT MOSQUITOES. FOR EACH BLEND WE WILL ALSO EVALUATE A VERSION WHICH HAS A PYRETHROID COMPONENT. FIRST, WE PLAN TO RIGOROUSLY VALIDATE THE COMPUTATIONALLY PREDICTED REPELLENTS IN MOSQUITO BEHAVIORAL ASSAYS. SINCE THE PREDICTIONS HAVE A VARIETY OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES, WE WILL ALSO USE BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS OF EXTANT MUTANTS IN AEDES AEGYPTI TO IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING RECEPTOR PATHWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR AVERSION. SECOND, WE PLAN TO BEHAVIORALLY EVALUATE VOLATILE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE KNOWN TO OVERSTIMULATE AND DISABLE THE CO2-RECPETOR FOR THEIR ABILITY TO MASK ATTRACTION SPATIALLY. THIRD, WE PROPOSE TO VALIDATE THE EFFICACY OF THE TWO NEWLY DISCOVERED PYRETHROIDS USING TOPICAL AND SPATIAL ASSAYS. AND FOURTH, WE WILL TEST THE DUAL AND TRIPLE AVERSIVE PATHWAY COMPOUNDS FOR REPELLENCY IN MOSQUITOES TO FIND THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMBINATION FOR SPATIAL AND TOPICAL REPELLENCY. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE SAFE, AFFORDABLE, AND PLEASANT-SMELLING ODORANTS THAT ARE BETTER THAN EXISTING ACTIVES IN REDUCING CONTACT BETWEEN HUMANS AND MOSQUITOES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "9bf7f829-5f05-a40d-9f7c-fdadacaf3e56-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DC014092_7529"}, {"internal_id": 67313630, "Award ID": "R56DC013048", "Award Amount": 229486.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-07-17", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "MECHANISMS OF HYPERSENSITIVITY TO SOUND-INDUCED COCHLEAR DAMAGE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6ad8c5c3-8085-49bb-9227-fc5bc4a1f938-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DC013048_7529"}, {"internal_id": 67834157, "Award ID": "R56DC012058", "Award Amount": 297208.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-08-10", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "AUDITORY NERVE DEGENERATION AND REPAIR", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "04a78f04-ee86-46df-5fbf-c71e46ed8479-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DC012058_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49825939, "Award ID": "R56DC011813", "Award Amount": 492167.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2017-07-31", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "DYNAMIC INTERACTION AMONG PROTEINS IN HAIR CELLS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "89c1b286-4842-cf79-9563-7ec2e987f771-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DC011813_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49825938, "Award ID": "R56DC011803", "Award Amount": 638123.53, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2017-07-19", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "IDENTIFYING GENES FOR NON-SYNDROMIC RECESSIVE DEAFNESS-A COLLABORATIVE STUDY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "23b1535c-77e8-dafd-4ece-46b518206e5d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DC011803_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49825936, "Award ID": "R56DC010786", "Award Amount": 121896.0, "Award Type": null, "Base Obligation Date": "2016-04-04", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "ACROSS-SITE PATTERNS OF COCHLEAR IMPLANT FUNCTION: IMPORTANCE OF COCHLEAR HEALTH", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1567efcf-bcdb-61b9-72f2-70cbed5fa626-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DC010786_7529"}, {"internal_id": 67832509, "Award ID": "R56DC010783", "Award Amount": 290117.55, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-08-14", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "CONCEPTUAL SYSTEM IN THE HEALTHY AND IMPAIRED BRAIN", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "873ae72b-bace-b481-a973-8304b7346bc0-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DC010783_7529"}, {"internal_id": 161646908, "Award ID": "R56DC009810", "Award Amount": 590424.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-07-28", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "NEURAL CODING AND PERCEPTION OF LEARNED VOCALIZATIONS - PROJECT SUMMARY HEARING AND VOICE ARE THE PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENTS OF HUMAN COMMUNICATION.

THE PRIMARY CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF OM ARE STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE (SPN), NONTYPEABLE HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE (NTHI) AND MORAXELLA CATARRHALIS (MCAT). SPN WAS ONCE THE LEADING CAUSE OF ACUTE OM (AOM); HOWEVER, THE INTRODUCTION OF PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINES (PVCS) HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SPN-ASSOCIATED AOM, THEREBY PAVING THE WAY FOR NTHI AND NON-VACCINE SPN SEROTYPES TO DOMINATE. VACCINATION REMAINS THE MOST IMPACTFUL AND COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO PREVENT OM, YET THE EVER-CHANGING BACTERIOLOGY OF OM REQUIRES NON-TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO RESOLVE, AND IDEALLY PREVENT, THIS GLOBAL PEDIATRIC DISEASE. CLARAMETYX BIOSCIENCES HAS DEVELOPED THE CMTX-301 VACCINE CANDIDATE TO ADDRESS ALL-PATHOGEN OM. IMMUNIZATION WITH CMTX-301 FOCUSES THE HOST IMMUNE RESPONSE ON SPECIFIC PROTECTIVE EPITOPES WITHIN COMPONENTS OF THE BACTERIAL BIOFILM RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS STRUCTURAL STABILITY. WHEN EXPOSED TO THESE ANTIBODIES, BIOFILMS RAPIDLY COLLAPSE WITH RELEASE OF BIOFILM-RESIDENT BACTERIA. GIVEN THAT BIOFILMS ARE THE GREATEST DEFENSE MECHANISM AGAINST DISEASE RESOLUTION, COLLAPSE OF THESE PROTECTIVE FORTRESSES HAS PROVEN TO AUGMENT DISEASE RESOLUTION IN MULTIPLE DIVERSE MODELS OF EXPERIMENTAL DISEASE, INCLUDING MODELS OF OM. BY RAPIDLY COLLAPSING BACTERIAL BIOFILMS, VACCINATION WITH CMTX-301 ALLOWS THE HOST\u2019S NATURAL IMMUNE RESPONSE TO CLEAR INFECTION IN A PATHOGEN-AGNOSTIC MANNER.

PRESENTLY, 14.1% (27.7 MILLION) OF ADULTS AGED 20\u201369 YEARS OF AGE HAVE UNILATERAL OR BILATERAL SPEECH-FREQUENCY HEARING IMPAIRMENT. UNCORRECTED HEARING LOSS GIVES RISE TO A POORER QUALITY OF LIFE AND INCREASED SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. FOR CHILDREN, HEARING LOSS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT SPEECH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT, ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND PSYCHOSOCIAL BEHAVIOR. ON THE OTHER END OF OUR LIFESPAN, RECENT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN HEARING LOSS IS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ACCELERATED COGNITIVE DECLINE AND INCIDENT COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN COMMUNITY DWELLING OLDER ADULTS.  MANY FORMS OF HEARING LOSS ARE TREATABLE OR ADDRESSABLE WITH TECHNOLOGY (E.G., HEARING AIDS). HOWEVER, DUE TO A LACK OF ACCESS TO DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, MANY CASES GO UNTREATED. A MAJOR LIMITER TO DIAGNOSTIC QUALITY HEARING TESTS IS THE NEED FOR EXPENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE, I.E., SOUND-PROOFED BOOTHS, AND AUDIOLOGISTS WITH SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN CONDUCTING EXAMS, WHICH ARE TRADITIONALLY CONDUCTED IN-PERSON AND ONE-ON-ONE. ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN INVESTMENT IN CHANGING THE MODEL OF DELIVERING HEARING ASSESSMENT, PARTICULARLY WITH NEW \u201cBOOTHLESS\u201d SOLUTIONS, THERE REMAINS STRONG NEEDS FOR (1) HARDWARE THAT MAINTAINS THE QUALITY REQUIRED FOR DIAGNOSTIC AUDIOMETRY IN \u201cBOOTHLESS\u201d SETTINGS, (2) AUTOMATED TESTING FOR ROUTINE TESTING THAT WOULD ALLOW AUDIOLOGISTS TO FOCUS ON THE MORE COMPLEX CASES, AND (3) NEW APPROACHES TO CONNECT AUDIOLOGISTS TO PATIENTS THROUGH TELEAUDIOLOGY\u2014ENABLING AUDIOLOGISTS TO PROVIDE THE EXPERTISE NEEDED FOR THE MORE COMPLEX CASES WITHOUT REQUIRING EITHER THE PATIENTS NOR THE AUDIOLOGISTS TO TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES.

IN THE FIELD OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS, A SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST\u2019S (SLP\u2019S) PERCEPTUAL EVALUATION OF THE QUALITY OF SPEECH PRODUCTION IS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR ASSESSMENT AND FOR DOCUMENTING TREATMENT PROGRESS. HOWEVER, DECADES OF RESEARCH HAVE CONFIRMED THAT AUDITORY-PERCEPTUAL JUDGMENTS OF SPEECH ARE INHERENTLY BIASED, WHICH COMPROMISES RELIABILITY. THE REASON IS THAT THE HUMAN PERCEPTUAL SYSTEM IS ADAPTIVE, WITH PERCEPTUAL BIAS ACCRUED BY WORKING WITH AN INDIVIDUAL ACROSS MULTIPLE TREATMENT SESSIONS, OR BY WORKING WITH PATIENT POPULATIONS ACROSS A CAREER. THUS, TO RELIABLY DOCUMENT TREATMENT OUTCOMES SUBJECTIVELY, IT IS NECESSARY TO INVOLVE MULTIPLE, UNFAMILIAR LISTENERS. THIS IS UNTENABLE IN MOST CLINICAL SETTINGS, WHICH MEANS THAT SUBJECTIVE IMPRESSIONS ARE MADE BY THE TREATING CLINICIANS. THE RELIANCE ON SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION DIRECTLY UNDERMINES THE QUALITY OF CLINICAL PRACTICE AND A CLINICIAN\u2019S ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFICACY OF AN INTERVENTION. AURAL ANALYTICS HAS DEVELOPED NEW OBJECTIVE ACOUSTIC SPEECH METRICS THAT RELIABLY MEASURE SPEECH IN POPULATIONS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. ITS TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON A STRONG SCIENTIFIC PREMISE AND HAS BEEN ADOPTED EARLY BY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND NEUROLOGISTS IN CLINICAL RESEARCH. AURAL ANALYTICS HAS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SPEECH SAMPLES USING ITS TECHNOLOGY, AND THE RESULTS ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT ITS MEASURES ARE ROBUST, RELIABLE, AND MORE SENSITIVE TO LONGITUDINAL CHANGES IN SPEECH THAN ARE OTHER EXISTING OUTCOME MEASURES. WE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A PHASE I SBIR PROJECT WITH THE AIM OF TRANSLATING OUR TECHNOLOGY TO SLP CLINICAL PRACTICE. THIS PHASE II PROPOSAL NATURALLY BUILDS ON OUR PREVIOUS WORK BY CONNECTING THE AUTOMATED APP-BASED OUTCOME MEASURES COMPLETED IN PHASE I TO THREE COMPLEMENTARY CLINICAL BENCHMARKS. SPECIFICALLY, SA1 WILL VALIDATE THE AURAL ANALYTICS SPEECH MEASURES AGAINST THE AMERICAN SPEECH-LANGUAGE-HEARING ASSOCIATION\u2019S (ASHA) FUNCTIONAL COMMUNICATION MEASURES (FCM) FOR MOTOR SPEECH; THE SENTENCE INTELLIGIBILITY TEST; AND EXPERT RATINGS OF SPEECH CHARACTERISTICS. IN ADDITION, AGE AND GENDER-BASED NORMS FOR ALL OBJECTIVE MEASURES WILL BE OBTAINED FROM COLLECTION OF DATA FROM 600 NEW HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS. IN SA2, AURAL ANALYTICS WILL CONDUCT A USABILITY STUDY WITH PRACTICING SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS TO ASSESS REAL WORLD UTILITY AND REFINE THE USER EXPERIENCE. THE DELIVERABLE OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE A FULLY-FUNCTIONAL MOBILE APPLICATION, VALIDATED BY PRACTICING SLPS IN A CLINICAL SETTING, WITH REAL TIME SPEECH OUTCOME METRICS VALIDATED WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING COMMUNITY-ACCEPTED MEASURES.

THIS DISABILITY LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED QUALITY OF LIFE AND A LARGE ECONOMIC BURDEN, ESTIMATED TO BE AROUND $750 BILLION WORLDWIDE, COMING FROM HEALTH SECTOR COSTS, EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT, AND LOSS OF WORKPLACE PRODUCTIVITY. FOR THIS POPULATION, AMPLIFICATION WITH EVEN THE MOST SOPHISTICATED HEARING AIDS IS USUALLY INEFFECTIVE, AND RESTORATIVE BIOLOGICAL THERAPIES ARE YEARS AWAY. A COCHLEAR IMPLANT IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY AVAILABLE ROUTE FOR RESTORING \u2018ADEQUATE\u2019 FUNCTIONALITY. ONLY 600,000 IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN DONE WORLDWIDE TILL 2019, AND ABOUT 50,000 DEVICES ARE BEING SOLD ANNUALLY. THIS LARGE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THOSE THAT CAN BENEFIT AND THOSE THAT ACTUALLY GET THE IMPLANT IS DRIVEN PARTLY BY THEIR COST, AVAILABILITY AND THE LACK OF TRAINED SURGEONS AND FACILITIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS IN THE CURRENT DEVICES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO VERY LOW ADOPTION: (A) THE HIGHLY VISIBLE UNIT ATTACHED TO THE SKULL OUTSIDE THE MASTOID BONE, CONNECTED BY A CABLE TO THE SOUND PROCESSOR AND RECHARGEABLE BATTERY PLACED BEHIND THE EARS, MAKES THE DISABILITY VERY OBVIOUS, AND CREATES AN UNACCEPTABLE SOCIAL STIGMA FOR MANY PATIENTS, CAUSING THEM TO REFUSE THIS OPTION; (B) SOUND FILTERING BY THE AURICLE AND AUDITORY CANAL IS BYPASSED BECAUSE OF THE EXTERNAL MICROPHONE, INTRODUCING UNNATURAL CUES; (C) THE DEVICE TYPICALLY MUST BE TAKEN OFF DURING SHOWERING OR SWIMMING (ALTHOUGH A FEW WATER- RESISTANT VERSIONS ARE NOW AVAILABLE), AND DURING SLEEPING, INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF DAMAGE, MISPLACEMENT, OR THE ABILITY TO HEAR IN THESE SITUATIONS; (D) HAVING AN EXTERNAL MAGNET THAT COUPLES AND ALIGNS THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMPONENTS CAN LEAD TO SKIN BREAKDOWN AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION; (E) THE LARGE FOOTPRINT AND PLACEMENT LEAVES OPEN THE RISK FOR DEVICE MIGRATION REQUIRING REVISION SURGERY. A FULLY INTERNAL COCHLEAR IMPLANT (FICI), THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANY BEHIND THE EAR COMPONENTS, WOULD ADDRESS THIS LARGE UNMET MEDICAL NEED. THERE ARE NO FICIS CURRENTLY APPROVED BY THE FDA. THE LACK OF A SELF-CONTAINED POWER SUPPLY IS A KEY ROADBLOCK PREVENTING REALIZATION OF ALL FICIS. THROUGH INNOVATIONS IN CIRCUIT DESIGN AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, COLLABORATING GROUPS AT MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR AND MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY HAVE DEVELOPED, TESTED AND PATENTED A LOW POWER (1 MW) SYSTEM-ON-A- CHIP (SOC) FOR A FICI, A CRITICAL ADVANCE. CURRENT RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES HAVE ORGANIC LIQUID ELECTROLYTES MAKING THEM UNSAFE FOR THIS APPLICATION. WITH SBIR PHASE I FUNDING, AUDIANCE, INC. HAS SHOWN PROOF OF CONCEPT OF AN ALL-SOLID SINGLE-STACK CELL THAT IS THE BUILDING BLOCK FOR A BATTERY THAT MEETS THE ELECTROCHEMICAL, SAFETY AND FOOTPRINT REQUIREMENTS FOR A FICI. THE FOCUS OF THIS SBIR PHASE II PROJECT IS TO BUILD A MULTI-STACK WIRELESSLY RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AND INTEGRATE IT WITH A BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT SENSES THE STATE OF HEALTH OF THE BATTERY AND CONTROLS THE CHARGE PROFILE TO PROVIDE TIMELY CHARGING AND MAXIMUM BATTERY LIFE. THE ALL-SOLID LIB WILL REMOVE A CRITICAL ROADBLOCK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FICI, AND THUS OPEN UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP MILLIONS OF PATIENTS AROUND THE WORLD WITH SEVERE TO PROFOUND SNHL.

WHEN ACOUSTIC AMPLIFICATION OF HEARING AIDS IS NO LONGER AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT, PATIENTS CAN RECEIVE A COCHLEAR IMPLANT (CI). CURRENTLY, THE SURGEON THREADS THE ELECTRODE ARRAY INTO THE SPIRAL COCHLEA, RISKING STRUCTURAL DAMAGE THAT DESTROYS RESIDUAL ACOUSTIC HEARING AND IMPACTS OVERALL HEARING OUTCOMES. CONSEQUENTLY, ADOPTION RATES REMAIN EXTREMELY LOW: 5% OF THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION IN THE US.

TO MEET THIS NEED, OUR TEAM OF EXPERTS IN HUMAN MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY IS PARTNERING WITH LEADING MOTOR SPEECH RESEARCHERS AND SLPS AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY TO DEVELOP A NOVEL HYBRID ACOUSTIC-ACCELEROMETER SENSOR PAIRED TO SOFTWARE FOR AUTOMATED NOISE MITIGATION AND DERIVATION OF VOCAL AND ARTICULATORY MEASURES FOR ASSESSING NATURAL CONVERSATIONAL SPEECH.

COMBINING BOTH SENSOR MODALITIES THEREFORE OFFERS THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN VOCAL AND ARTICULATORY MEASURES DURING NATURAL CONVERSATIONAL INTERACTIONS. OUR PHASE I PLAN WILL CUSTOM DESIGN A MICROCONTROLLER, SOFTWARE, AND FIRMWARE TO INTEGRATE AN ACOUSTIC MICROPHONE AND ACCELEROMETER INTO A SINGLE, NECK-WORN SENSOR, WHICH WILL BE USED TO ACQUIRE A CORPUS OF SPEECH DATA FROM PATIENTS WITH HYPOKINETIC DYSARTHRIA FROM PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE (PD) DURING CONVERSATIONAL ACTIVITIES WITH AND WITHOUT VARIOUS SOURCES OF NOISE.

MTD IS CHARACTERIZED BY ABNORMAL COACTIVATION OF MUSCLES IN AND AROUND THE LARYNX THAT CAUSES VOCAL STRAIN - LEADING TO DISCOMFORT AND PAIN THAT IMPEDE VOCAL COMMUNICATION AND MAY LEAD TO SURGERY. WHILE VOICE THERAPY CAN MITIGATE THESE HEALTH RISKS BY REDUCING LARYNGEAL TENSION AND RESTORING MUSCLE BALANCE, THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR GUIDING THERAPY IS BY MANUAL PALPATIONS AND AUDITORY-PERCEPTUAL IMPRESSIONS \u2013 HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE METHODS WITH POOR INTER-RATER RELIABILITY.

THESE METHODS ARE ALSO INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RECENT NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT FACILITATES REMOTE ASSESSMENT IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19.

FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL APPARATUS FOR VOLTAMMETRY, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, AND NEUROMODULATION (MAVEN) WILL OFFER WIRELESS VOLTAMMETRIC SENSING OF MULTIPLE NEUROTRANSMITTERS (E.G., DOPAMINE, SEROTONIN, AND ADENOSINE) AT CARBON-FIBER MICROELECTRODES. MAVEN CAN BE APPLIED TO A BROAD RANGE OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH SUBJECTS INVOLVING BRAIN NEUROSURGERIES. ALONGSIDE THESE MULTIPLE NEUROCHEMICAL SENSING CAPABILITIES, THE DEVICE WILL BE CAPABLE OF NEAR-SIMULTANEOUS ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL (E.G., ACTION AND LOCAL FIELD POTENTIALS) RECORDINGS. THE MAIN INNOVATION OF THE MAVEN SYSTEM IS TO INCLUDE STATE-OF-THE-ART VOLTAMMETRIC TECHNIQUES TO QUANTITATIVELY MEASURE BOTH PHASIC (STIMULATION-INDUCED) AND TONIC (RESTING) CONCENTRATION LEVELS OF NEUROCHEMICALS IN REAL-TIME AND NEAR-SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH OTHER RECORDING MODALITIES. THIS CAPABILITY IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, MULTIPLE CYCLIC SQUARE WAVE VOLTAMMETRY (MCSWV) WILL ENABLE SECOND-TO-SECOND QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF TONIC EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND SEROTONIN WITH EXCEPTIONAL SPATIAL RESOLUTION, SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AND MINIMAL TISSUE DISTURBANCE. THIS PROPOSAL EMPLOYS OUR UNIQUE COMBINED EXPERTISE IN NEUROSCIENCE, ELECTROCHEMISTRY, ENGINEERING, AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO VALIDATE THIS NOVEL CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTRUMENT IN PREPARATION FOR ITS USE DURING INTRAOPERATIVE CLINICAL NEUROSURGERIES. ALSO, COMBINING ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY AND ELECTROCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGIES WOULD ENABLE INVESTIGATORS TO PROBE UNEXPLORED LINKS BETWEEN THE ABNORMAL ACTIVITY OF NEURAL ELEMENTS AND THE DOPAMINERGIC, SEROTONERGIC, PURINERGIC (ADENOSINE) DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROPSYCHOPATHOLOGIES, SUCH AS PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE, ESSENTIAL TREMOR, OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER, DEPRESSION, AND EPILEPSY. OUR LARGE ANIMAL MODEL (SWINE) STUDIES EMULATING EXISTING HUMAN INTRAOPERATIVE NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION TO GUIDE AND INFORM THE FINALIZATION OF THE MAVEN DESIGN FOR USE BY THE CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE COMMUNITY IN FUTURE IDE-ENABLED MECHANISTIC CLINICAL STUDIES. OUR PROPOSAL SEEKS TO (1) FINALIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAVEN, TOGETHER WITH A SOPHISTICATED USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE INTERFACE THAT (2) MEETS DEVICE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, REGULATORY DESIGN CONTROL, AND MEDICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN AN FDA-APPROVED INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE), AND (3) USE A SWINE MODEL TO DEVELOP MAVEN STIMULATION AND RECORDING PROTOCOLS FOR USE IN EXISTING INTRAOPERATIVE NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES (E.G., DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION NEUROSURGERIES AND CORTICAL LOBECTOMIES).

SMELL DISORDERS ARE ALSO MUCH MORE COMMON THAN MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE, WITH ONE MAJOR PRE-COVID-19 STUDY FINDING THAT OVER 12% AMERICANS AGE 40 AND OLDER HAD HYPOSMIA (A REDUCED ABILITY TO SMELL) OR ANOSMIA (AN INABILITY TO SMELL). HOWEVER, DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL PREVALENCE AND SIGNIFICANT HEALTH IMPACTS, SMELL DISORDERS REMAIN ROUTINELY UNDERDIAGNOSED, IN PART BECAUSE ROUTINE OLFACTORY SCREENING IS NOT A PART OF PRIMARY CARE.

AS AN UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCE, THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT FPE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED, DUE TO ITS TECHNOLOGY HAVING NOT IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, DESPITE MEDICAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACEMASKS BEING USED FOR OVER 100 YEARS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY A PROBLEM WITH HEALTHCARE WORKERS, WHO MUST WEAR FACEMASKS OR RESPIRATORS FOR LONG PERIODS, OFTEN SEVERAL HOURS. THESE PROBLEMS INCLUDE FOGGING OF EYEWEAR, IMPROPER FITTING, DISCOMFORT TO THE WEARER, AND HINDERED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. IN ADDITION, THE MATERIALS MADE IN COMMONLY AVAILABLE FPE CAN OFTEN BE HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THEIR DISPOSAL CAN GENERATE A LARGE AMOUNT OF HAZARDOUS LANDFILL WASTE WHEN USED IN PRESENT DAY QUANTITIES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH SEEKS TO REMEDY THIS BY DEVELOPING NEW FPE DESIGNS. THE FIRST OF THESE WILL BE AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE STRAPLESS FACEMASK DESIGNED BY SEEUS95, INC. (NEW YORK, NY) KNOWN AS THE SEEUS95 RESPIRATOR MASK. THE CURRENT HALF-MASK DESIGN WILL BE TESTED AND TRIALED BY VOLUNTEERS, AS WELL AS MODIFIED TO CREATE A MODIFICATION CHILD-SIZE VERSION. THE SEEUS95 MASKS FEATURES AN ECO-FRIENDLY NEW FILTER DESIGN AND CARTRIDGE USING NATURAL MATERIALS (I.E., AIR-BLOWN PLA) WITH NO POLYPROPYLENE, THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN AIR FILTRATION.

CSOM IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF PERSISTENT HEARING LOSS FOR CHILDREN IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, AND AFFECTS 330 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY A CHRONICALLY INFECTED, DISCHARGING MIDDLE EAR, AND CURRENTLY HAS NO EFFECTIVE MEDICAL THERAPY. THE BACTERIUM PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA (PA) IS A LEADING CAUSE OF CSOM, AND COLONIZES THE MIDDLE EAR VIA A PERFORATED TYMPANIC MEMBRANE, WHERE IT BECOMES ESTABLISHED INTO A BIOFILM COMMUNITY. THE CURRENT PRIMARY TREATMENT MODALITY FOR CSOM, FLUOROQUINOLONE (USUALLY OFLOXACIN) EARDROPS, IS INEFFECTIVE IN COMPLETELY ELIMINATING CSOM INFECTION, APPARENTLY DUE TO AN INABILITY TO TARGET THE SUBPOPULATION OF METABOLICALLY INACTIVE BACTERIA WITHIN THE BIOFILM KNOWN AS \u2018PERSISTER CELLS\u2019. THESE PERSISTER CELLS REPOPULATE THE BIOFILM NICHE AFTER THE FLUOROQUINOLONE THERAPY IS DISCONTINUED, CAUSING CSOM TO RELAPSE. THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT LEVERAGES THE COMBINED EXPERTISE OF THE SANTA MARIA LAB, WHICH HAS CREATED A MOUSE MODEL FOR CSOM WITH PA BIOFILMS AND HAS RECENT MIDDLE EAR TRANSLATIONAL SUCCESS, AND THE BARRON LAB, WHICH DEVELOPS ANTIMICROBIALS. OUR INNOVATIVE APPROACH INVOLVES THE DESIGN, SYNTHESIS, OPTIMIZATION AND IN VIVO TESTING OF UNIQUELY BIOSTABLE ANALOGUESOF NATURAL ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES (AMPS). AMPS ARE NATURAL DEFENSE MECHANISMS TO COMBAT INFECTIOUS AGENTS IN VIVO, AND SOME ARE EFFECTIVE AGAINST BIOFILMS; YET THEIR POOR BIOAVAILABILITY (I.E. RAPID IN VIVO PROTEOLYTIC DEGRADATION) LIMITS THEIR CLINICAL USE. WE WILL UTILIZE AMP MIMICS BASED WHICH ARE SEQUENCE- AND LENGTH-SPECIFIC OLIGO-N-SUBSTITUTED GLYCINE MIMICS OF NATURAL POLYPEPTIDES. ON PEPTOIDS, PEPTOIDS ARE BASED ON A POLYPEPTIDE BACKBONE; YET HAVE SIDE-CHAINS APPENDED TO BACKBONE NITROGENS. BECAUSE OF THIS STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE, PEPTOIDS ARE COMPLETELY STABLE TO PROTEOLYSIS. FURTHERMORE, THEY CAN BE MADE IN HIGH YIELDS AT REASONABLE COST, USING AN AUTOMATED PEPTIDE SYNTHESIZER. SYNTHETIC ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTOIDS (SAMPS) ARE POTENT DRUGS THAT CAN COMPLETELY ELIMINATE PERSISTERS IN BIOFILMS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT SAMPS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OFLOXACIN AT KILLING PLANKTONIC PERSISTER CELLS AND ERADICATING MATURE BIOFILMS. OUR AIMS ARE FOCUSED ON OPTIMIZING OUR LEAD SAMP CANDIDATE AND CONFIRMING EFFICACY IN OUR CSOM MOUSE MODEL. THE AIMS ARE: (1) IN VITRO SCREENING OF TM5 ANALOGS MODIFIED TO IMPROVE EFFICACY AGAINST CLINICAL ISOLATE PERSISTER CELLS AND MATURE BIOFILMS AND (2) SHOWING PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT THE LEAD SAMP CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN A CSOM MOUSE MODEL WHILE ALSO BEING NON-OTOTOXIC.

THIS IS ACHIEVED, PRESUMABLY, BY THIS SMALL COLLECTION OF ONLY ~1,600 NEURONS IN RODENTS SPIKING SYNCHRONOUSLY. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE RECORDINGS OF MANY LC SINGLE UNITS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ANESTHETIZED RATS DEMONSTRATED THAT LC POPULATION ACTIVITY CONSISTS OF A NUANCED PATTERN OF DISTINCT ENSEMBLES THAT ARE INDEPENDENTLY ACTIVE.

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE UTILIZATION OF HEARING HEALTHCARE AMONG RURAL ADULTS THROUGH RHCS WITH THE R21 PHASE OF THE PROGRAM AND THEN DEVELOP A CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE RHC PATIENT NAVIGATION PROGRAM (PNP) TO PROMOTE UTILIZATION OF HEARING HEALTHCARE. TO CONDUCT THIS STUDY, WE WILL PARTNER WITH 10 HIGH-NEED UNDER-RESOURCED RHCS WITHIN RURAL APPALACHIAN COUNTIES IN KENTUCKY AND UTILIZE THE PRECEDE-PROCEED MODEL (PPM) TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THE RURAL ADULT HEARING HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE PRIORITIES, NEEDS, AND RESOURCES TO INFORM INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT. DURING THE R21 PHASE WE WILL 1) CONDUCT A SOCIAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF RURAL ADULT HEARING HEALTHCARE AND 2) ASSESS THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCING HEARING HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION IN RHCS. THE MILESTONES OF THE R21 INCLUDE THE DETERMINATION OF THE PREVALENCE OF HEARING LOSS AND HEARING HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION IN RURAL ADULTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF RURAL ADULT HEARING HEALTHCARE PRIORITIES, AND DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD AND A RURAL PROVIDER TASKFORCE. DURING THE R33 PHASE WE WILL 1) DEVELOP OF A COMMUNITY-BASED HEARING HEALTHCARE PATIENT NAVIGATION PROGRAM FOR RHCS AND 2) PILOT TEST THE RURAL HEARING HEALTHCARE NAVIGATION PROGRAM. THE MILESTONES OF THE R33 PHASE INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PNP PROTOCOL, ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE NAVIGATOR ON RURAL ADULTS OBTAINING DIAGNOSTIC AUDIOGRAM, AND EVALUATION OF THE PNP FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND APPROPRIATENESS. THIS STUDY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT AIMS TO REDUCE ACCESS TO CARE BARRIERS TO TIMELY DIAGNOSTIC HEARING TESTING FOR RURAL ADULTS TO PREVENT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. THIS RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE IN DEVELOPMENT AND PILOT TESTING OF A NOVEL INTERVENTION NOT PREVIOUSLY ASSESSED IN ADULT HEARING HEALTHCARE WITHIN AN RHC SETTING. OUR RESULTS WILL IMPACT THE FIELD BY PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITIES TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY OF INNOVATIVE PATIENT SUPPORTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE RURAL HEARING HEALTHCARE ACCESS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c477975b-68db-c3dc-4a79-b95cb9f6ab3e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R33DC019602_7529"}, {"internal_id": 155737706, "Award ID": "R33DC019073", "Award Amount": 590718.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-12-21", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "IMPROVING ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY OF ADULT HEARING HEALTHCARE: EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS IN WEST CENTRAL AND SOUTH ALABAMA - ABSTRACT  MOUNTING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT HEARING LOSS IS ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIAL ISOLATION, DEPRESSION AND COGNITIVE DECLINE.

FOR THOSE WITH NO AVAILABLE OR AFFORDABLE HEARING HEALTHCARE RESOURCES, THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF HEARING LOSS ARE MOST LIKELY WORSE WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE WITH ACCESS TO HEARING HEALTHCARE. BY IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE FOR ALL, WE CAN HELP TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF HEARING LOSS.

THE LONG TERM GOALS OF THIS LINE OF RESEARCH ARE TO UNDERSTAND HOW LIMITED ACCESS TO HEARING HEALTH CARE AFFECTS THOSE WHO LIVE IN PERSISTENTLY POOR REGIONS OF THE STATE, AND ADDITIONALLY, TO IDENTIFY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN THESE AREAS. THIS INDIVIDUALLY RANDOMIZED GROUP TREATMENT CLINICAL TRIAL WILL USE COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR) TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE WITH HEARING LOSS AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVING IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF WEST CENTRAL AND SOUTH ALABAMA. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO 1) CONDUCT A CBPR NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT WILL REFINE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SPECIFIC HEARING HEALTH CARE NEEDS FOR THOSE WITH NO ACCESS TO HEARING HEALTH CARE IN WEST CENTRAL AND SOUTH ALABAMA; 2) DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH ADVISOR (CHA) AURAL REHABILITATION (AR) TRAINING PROGRAM; 3) IDENTIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PERSONAL SOUND AMPLIFICATION PRODUCTS (PSAPS) FOR DECREASING HEARING HANDICAP AND IMPROVING SPEECH PERCEPTION IN ADULTS WITH NO ACCESS TO HEARING HEALTH CARE, AND 4) IMPLEMENT AN ADULT AURAL REHABILITATION (AR) PROGRAM FOR THOSE WITHOUT ACCESS TO HEARING HEALTH CARE TO IMPROVE PSAP BENEFIT, PROMOTE PSAP USE AND LEAD TO INCREASED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). FOLLOWING THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND TRAINING PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH COORDINATORS AND ADVISORS, AN INTERVENTION PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED CONSISTING OF PERSONAL SOUND AMPLIFICATION PRODUCTS (PSAPS) AND AN AURAL REHABILITATION (AR) PROGRAM FOR ADULTS WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE HEARING LOSS WHO HAVE NO ACCESS TO HEARING HEALTHCARE. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT PSAP USE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE HEARING HANDICAP AND IMPROVE SPEECH PERCEPTION. A SECOND HYPOTHESIS IS THAT COMPARED TO ADULTS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THE AR PROGRAM, PSAP BENEFIT AND USE WILL BE GREATER, COMMUNICATION IN DIFFICULT LISTENING CONDITIONS WILL BE BETTER, AND QOL WILL BE POSITIVELY AFFECTED FOR THOSE WHO DID PARTICIPATE IN THE AR PROGRAM.

UNTREATED AGE-RELATED HEARING LOSS (ARHL) IS THE MOST PREVALENT CAUSE OF REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PERSONS 55 AND OLDER IN THE US. THERE ARE 30+ MILLION HEARING-IMPAIRED ADULTS IN THIS COUNTRY, MANY OF WHOM HAVE NEVER HAD A HEARING TEST. ONE REASON IS THE LACK OF CONVENIENT, INEXPENSIVE AND VALID HEARING TESTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND HEARING PROFESSIONALS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A FAMILY OF TESTS OF AUDITORY SENSITIVITY AND OF RELATED COGNITIVE STATUS THAT TOGETHER MEASURE FUNCTIONAL HEARING LOSS. IF SUCH TESTS WERE WIDELY AVAILABLE LARGE NUMBERS OF THOSE WHO SUSPECT THEY MAY HAVE HEARING LOSS WOULD TAKE THEM. THIS WAS DEMONSTRATED BY OVER 3000 CALLS IN A SINGLE DAY TO THE TELEPHONE-ADMINISTERED NATIONAL HEARING TEST (NHT), WITHOUT COMMERCIAL PROMOTION, ONLY IN RESPONSE TO A FEW NEWSPAPER ARTICLES. THE IDENTIFICATION OF SPOKEN THREE-DIGIT SEQUENCES IN A NOISE BACKGROUND, AS USED IN THE NHT, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO CORRELATE STRONGLY WITH TRADITIONAL PURE-TONE MEASURES OF HEARING LOSS. DIGIT-IN-NOISE (DIN) TESTS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SHOWN TO BE PARTICULARLY EFFICIENT FOR SCREENING, SINCE THEY ARE RELIABLE, CONVENIENT, AND REQUIRE NEITHER SOUND BOOTHS NOR HIGHLY TRAINED PERSONNEL FOR THEIR ADMINISTRATION. A FAMILY OF DIN TESTS WILL BE DESIGNED TO HELP DISTINGUISH POOR SPEECH RECOGNITION DUE TO SENSITIVITY LOSS FROM POOR RECOGNITION THAT REFLECTS REDUCED COGNITIVE PROCESSING. THE TESTS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON SMARTPHONES, TABLETS, DESKTOP AND LAPTOP COMPUTERS WITH ANDROID OR IOS OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE NHT DEVELOPED EARLIER FOR LANDLINE PHONES (WATSON ET AL., 2012; WILLIAMS ET AL., 2014), HAS BEEN TAKEN BY NEARLY 130,000 CALLERS SINCE 2014. THOSE DATA, PLUS AUDIOGRAMS FROM 700+ ADULTS (VETERANS) WHO WERE GIVEN THE DIN TEST TOGETHER WITH OTHER STANDARD AUDIOMETRY, WILL GUIDE TEST DEVELOPMENT. OPTIONAL SPOKEN RATHER THAN KEYPAD RESPONSES WILL MAKE THE TEST ACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN AND TO ELDERLY ADULTS WITH MOTOR-CONTROL PROBLEMS. VALIDATION STUDIES WILL TEST 590 PARTICIPANTS IN THREE UNIVERSITY HEARING CENTERS. DIN SENSITIVITY TESTS WILL BE VALIDATED IN RELATION TO PURE-TONE AUDIOGRAMS, WHILE COGNITIVE-STATUS TESTS WILL BE COMPARED TO ESTABLISHED TESTS OF WORKING MEMORY, EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, AND SELECTIVE ATTENTION. AUDIOGRAM SLOPE WILL BE ESTIMATED BY COMPARING DIN-TEST PERFORMANCE USING LOW-FREQUENCY MASKING NOISE, TO THAT WITH SPEECH-SPECTRUM NOISE. THIS NEW FAMILY OF TESTS ON A VARIETY OF PLATFORMS, WILL BE DESIGNED FOR USE IN THE HOME, IN SCHOOLS, IN PRIMARY-CARE PHYSICIANS\u2019 OFFICES, IN HEARING CLINICS AND IN NOISY BUSINESSES.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DELINEATE THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE MONOCARBOXYLATE TRANSPORTER, MCT6, IN MEDIATING CISPLATIN-INDUCED HEARING LOSS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MCT6 PROMOTES UPTAKE OF AN N-ACETYLCYSTEINE S-CONJUGATE METABOLITE OF CISPLATIN (NAC-1) RESULTING IN SEVERE DAMAGE TO COCHLEAR HAIR CELLS AND LOSS OF HEARING. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROJECT IS THAT A PREDICTED REDUCED FUNCTIONAL GENETIC VARIANT OF MCT6 (RS4788863) WAS PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER RATES OF CISPLATIN-INDUCED OTOTOXICITY. EVALUATING THE MECHANISM BY WHICH MCT6 CONTRIBUTES TO CISPLATIN-MEDIATED HEARING LOSS IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS WHETHER PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITION OF THIS TRANSPORTER WOULD BE PROTECTIVE OF AN ADVERSE EVENT THAT HAS NO CURRENT CURATIVE OR PREVENTATIVE MEASURES.

THIS AIM INCLUDES LAB-BASED AND VIRTUAL TEST PROTOCOLS THAT WILL MEASURE SPEECH UNDERSTANDING, NONSPEECH AUDITORY PROCESSING, AND NONVERBAL COGNITIVE (I.E., EXECUTIVE FUNCTION) PROCESSING SKILLS. THE RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES WILL IMPROVE OUR THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF SPEECH PERCEPTION ABILITIES FOR ALL OLDER ADULTS, WHILE SPECIFICALLY INCREASING THE KNOWLEDGE BASE RELATED TO SPANISH/ENGLISH BILINGUAL OLDER ADULTS. THE INVESTIGATIONS UNDERTAKEN IN AIM 2 WILL FOCUS ON ASSESSING AND DEFINING THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH AGE, HEARING LOSS, AND BILINGUALISM IN EVERY DAY COMMUNICATION. A MIXED METHODS APPROACH WILL BE UNDERTAKEN IN AIM 2. ONE STUDY WILL RELY ON ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA)\u2014BRIEF SURVEYS SENT VIA MOBILE DEVICE PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY\u2014TO QUANTIFY THE DEMAND FOR USE OF BOTH LANGUAGES IN A LATINX COMMUNITY OF OLDER ADULTS WITHIN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF A MAJORITY ENGLISH-SPEAKING ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, INTERVIEWS WITH THE EMA PARTICIPANTS WILL ADD CONTEXT TO THE SURVEY QUESTIONS RELATED TO COMMUNICATION AND EFFORT EXPERIENCED IN DAILY ENCOUNTERS. FINALLY, FOCUS GROUPS WILL EXPLORE ISSUES RELATED TO AGING AND HEARING LOSS, AND THEIR IMPACT ON SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT FOR OLDER BILINGUAL LATINX ADULTS. IMPORTANTLY, WE WILL SEEK TO DETERMINE WHAT THE HEARING AND COMMUNICATION PRIORITIES ARE FOR THIS GROWING AND UNDERSERVED POPULATION OF OLDER ADULTS. THE KNOWLEDGE GENERATED REGARDING SPEECH UNDERSTANDING AND COMMUNICATION NEEDS AND PRIORITIES WILL BE USED IN FUTURE GRANT APPLICATIONS TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY-INTEGRATED SERVICE MODELS THAT WILL BETTER SERVE OLDER ADULTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f879ffdd-a594-a5e7-2f71-72b5613abc69-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC020790_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151947770, "Award ID": "R21DC020788", "Award Amount": 387500.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-16", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF LISTENING EFFORT AND THEIR DEPENDENCE ON AGE - SPEECH UNDERSTANDING IS A KEY FUNCTION OF HUMAN AUDITION WITH IMPORTANT ROLES IN LEARNING, PROFESSIONAL, AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONS. AGEING IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED DIFFICULTIES WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION, PARTICULARLY IN NOISY BACKGROUNDS, ALTHOUGH TRADITIONAL CLINICAL TESTS FREQUENTLY FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR SUBJECTIVE SPEECH PERCEPTION DIFFICULTIES. A GROWING BODY OF WORK HAS IDENTIFIED INCREASED COMPENSATORY USE OF COGNITIVE RESOURCES, COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS LISTENING EFFORT (LE), AS A KEY CHANGE WITHIN THE AGEING AND HEARING-IMPAIRED POPULATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, ACCURATE MEASURES OF LE MAY SERVE AS CRITICAL OBJECTIVE DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS FOR QUANTIFYING SUBJECTIVE SPEECH PERCEPTION DEFICITS. WHILE MULTIPLE METHODS FOR QUANTIFYING LE HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHETHER THESE MEASURES REFLECT USAGE OF THE SAME UNDERLYING COGNITIVE PROCESSES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF CONTINUOUS SPEECH IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER MEANINGFUL SPEECH MASKERS. MOREOVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHETHER CHANGES IN LE AFFECT PROCESSING OF LOWER- AND HIGHER-LEVEL FEATURES (E.G., ACOUSTIC ENVELOPE VS. LEXICAL SURPRISAL) THROUGHOUT THE AUDITORY CORTICAL HIERARCHY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ADDRESS THESE IMPORTANT GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE. IN AIM 1, WE WILL MANIPULATE LE DEMANDS VIA CHANGES IN SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO OR SPATIAL CUES IN A SPEECH RECOGNITION TASK UTILIZING ISOLATED SENTENCES MASKED BY COMPETING SPEECH, WHILE MEASURING THREE COMMONLY USED MEASURES OF LE (SELF-REPORT, PUPIL SIZE, AND NEURAL MEASURE OF ALPHA BAND POWER). WE WILL THEN CORRELATE THESE MEASURES WITH ONE ANOTHER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE SIMILARLY MODULATED BY INTELLIGIBILITY MANIPULATIONS, INDICATING COMMON UNDERLYING COGNITIVE PROCESSES. IN AIM 2, WE WILL ADDRESS TWO KEY QUESTIONS. FIRST, WE WILL TEST WHETHER THE LE MEASURES USED IN AIM 1 EXHIBIT SIMILAR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE CONTEXT OF MORE NATURALISTIC, CONTINUOUS SPEECH, MORE CLOSELY MIMICKING SCENARIOS IN WHICH SPEECH PERCEPTION DIFFICULTIES ARE COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED. SECOND, WE WILL USE ADVANCED MODEL-BASED ANALYSES TO DECOMPOSE SPEECH-EVOKED ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY INTO RESPONSES TO LOWER- AND HIGHER-LEVEL FEATURES OF BOTH ATTENDED AND IGNORED SPEECH AND ASSESS HOW LE MANIPULATIONS MODULATE THESE REPRESENTATIONS. DOING SO, WE WILL GAIN NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HIGHER-ORDER COGNITIVE PROCESSES AND THE LANGUAGE PROCESSING PATHWAYS IN THE CORTEX, POTENTIALLY REVEALING NEW NEURAL SIGNATURES OF LE. FINALLY, TO GAIN DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF AGING EFFECTS ON LE AND SPEECH PROCESSING, WE WILL ASSESS HOW EACH AIM\u2019S KEY MEASURES CHANGE AS A FUNCTION OF AGE.

NON-AUTISTIC COMPREHENSION OF MORE SOCIAL (E.G., NARRATIVE) TEXTS IS BETTER THAN LESS SOCIAL (E.G., EXPOSITORY TEXTS) BECAUSE NON-AUTISTICS CAN BOOTSTRAP THEIR REAL-WORLD SOCIAL UNDERSTANDING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEXT. IN CONTRAST, AUTISTIC COMPREHENSION OF LESS SOCIAL TEXTS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN A SMALL PILOT STUDY TO BE BETTER THAN MORE SOCIAL TEXTS, WHICH IS LIKELY DUE TO THEIR SOCIAL COMMUNICATION IMPAIRMENTS. THE CONSTRUCTION-INTEGRATION THEORY OF COMPREHENSION STIPULATES THAT A SITUATION MODEL (I.E., A MENTAL REPRESENTATION) IS CONSTRUCTED THROUGH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CHILD FACTORS (I.E., INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN A CHILD\u2019S ABILITIES) AND TEXT FACTORS (I.E., INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES ACROSS TEXTS). BOTH LINGUISTIC CHILD FACTORS (E.G., VOCABULARY AND MORPHOSYNTAX) AND SOCIAL CHILD FACTORS (E.G., SOCIAL COMMUNICATION AND THEORY OF MIND) PREDICT READING COMPREHENSION IN AUTISTIC CHILDREN. HOWEVER, THESE FACTORS HAVE NOT BEEN EXAMINED FOR LISTENING COMPREHENSION IN AUTISTIC CHILDREN AND HAVE ONLY BEEN EXAMINED FOR MORE SOCIAL TEXTS.

THESE \u201cLATE TALKERS\u201d (LTS) ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR A LATER DIAGNOSIS OF LANGUAGE DISORDER, AND EVEN THOSE LTS WHO ARE NOT DIAGNOSED STILL HAVE POORER LONG-TERM LANGUAGE OUTCOMES AS COMPARED TO THEIR TYPICALLY DEVELOPING PEERS (TDS). AT PRESENT, WE DO NOT KNOW WHY SOME CHILDREN STRUGGLE TO DEVELOP THEIR VOCABULARIES, AND WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHICH LTS ARE AT GREATEST RISK FOR LANGUAGE DISORDER.  THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON TODDLERS\u2019 VERB VOCABULARIES BECAUSE OF THE ROLE THAT VERBS PLAY IN DEVELOPING GRAMMAR. DIFFICULTY WITH VERBS IS CONSIDERED A WARNING SIGN FOR LATER LANGUAGE DISORDER, AND CHILDREN WITH LANGUAGE DISORDER IN TURN STRUGGLE PARTICULARLY WITH VERBS. TO LEARN NEW VERBS, TODDLERS USE INFORMATION DERIVED FROM THE SURROUNDING LINGUISTIC CONTEXT, SUCH AS SENTENCE STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, THIS ABILITY IS PREDICATED ON PREEXISTING KNOWLEDGE OF VERBS. CONCERNINGLY, OUR PRIOR RESEARCH INDICATES THAT LTS AND TDS DIFFER IN EARLY VERB KNOWLEDGE: LTS HAVE MORE RESULT VERBS (I.E., VERBS THAT DENOTE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT, SUCH AS \u201cBREAK\u201d) THAN MANNER VERBS (I.E., VERBS THAT DENOTE HOW AN EVENT UNFOLDS, SUCH AS \u201cRUN\u201d) IN THEIR VOCABULARIES. THIS PATTERN MIMICS BIASES FOR RESULT OVER MANNER MEANINGS OBSERVED IN OLDER CHILDREN WITH LANGUAGE DISORDER. HOWEVER, TDS HAVE MORE MANNER THAN RESULT VERBS THROUGHOUT DEVELOPMENT. IN CONTEXTS WHERE VERB LEARNING IS DEPENDENT ON KNOWLEDGE OF MANNER VERSUS RESULT MEANINGS, LTS AND TDS ARE LIKELY TO PERFORM DIFFERENTLY.  IN AIM 1/STUDY 1, WE CONSIDER ONE SUCH MANIPULATION: WHETHER THE SEQUENCING OF THE LINGUISTIC INFORMATION (I.E., THE VERB) AND ITS REFERENT ACTION IMPACTS VERB LEARNING. TDS APPEAR TO LEARN MANNER VERBS BEST WHEN THE VERB PRECEDES THE ACTION, BUT THEY LEARN RESULT VERBS BEST WHEN THE VERB FOLLOWS THE ACTION. HOWEVER, OLDER CHILDREN WITH LANGUAGE DISORDER BETTER LEARN VERBS WHEN THEY FOLLOW THE ACTION, IRRESPECTIVE OF VERB MEANING. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT LTS WILL SHOW THE SAME PATTERN AS OLDER CHILDREN WITH LANGUAGE DISORDER BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE A BIAS FOR RESULT OVER MANNER VERBS. IF TRUE, THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST DEMONSTRATED VERB LEARNING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LTS AND TDS.  LEARNING A VERB\u2019S MEANING FROM ITS LINGUISTIC CONTEXT ALSO REQUIRES THAT CHILDREN BE ABLE TO PROCESS THE GIVEN LINGUISTIC INFORMATION. CONVERSELY, CHILDREN WHO DO NOT PROCESS THE LINGUISTIC CONTEXT FAIL TO LEARN NEW VERB MEANINGS. IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE FASTER LINGUISTIC PROCESSORS ARE BETTER VERB LEARNERS, BUT THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN DEMONSTRATED EXPERIMENTALLY. IN AIM 2/STUDY 2, WE CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONCURRENT PROCESSING OF FAMILIAR WORDS AND PERFORMANCE ON A VERB-LEARNING TASK (I.E., STUDY 1).

OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESES ARE THAT SPECIFIC PLASMA METABOLITES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH RISK OF DEVELOPING TINNITUS AND THAT GENETIC VARIANTS INFLUENCE HOW ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TINNITUS.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE ARBORIZATIONS OF SOMATOSENSORY NEURONS DEFINE THE GEOMETRY AND SIZE OF THEIR RECEPTIVE FIELDS. IN CONTRAST, THE NUMEROUS CILIA OR DENDRITIC BRANCHES OF OLFACTORY RECEPTOR NEURONS (ORNS) ARE THOUGHT TO INCREASE SENSORY SURFACE AREA FOR HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY. HOWEVER, THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF DENDRITIC SIZE AND SHAPE ON OLFACTION HAVE YET TO BE EXPERIMENTALLY DEFINED.

ONE LIKELY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE REDUCED ABILITY TO HEAR IN NOISE AS WE AGE IS LOSS OF NEURONAL INHIBITION IN THE CENTRAL AUDITORY PATHWAY, PARTICULARLY AUDITORY CORTEX (AC). WORK IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS HAS SHOWN THAT BOTH HEARING LOSS AND AGE, PER SE, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED LEVELS OF THE INHIBITORY NEURAL TRANSMITTER GABA (GAMMA AMINOBUTYRIC ACID) IN AC AND OTHER NUCLEI OF THE ASCENDING AUDITORY PATHWAY. SUCH LOSS OF NEURONAL INHIBITION LIKELY HAS SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ABILITY TO HEAR IN NOISE VIA HYPEREXCITABILITY OF AC NEURONS.

ANTIVIRAL DRUGS AND STEROIDS ONLY IMPROVE THE OUTCOME FOR A SMALL GROUP OF PATIENTS. IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR ETIOLOGY OF VIRUS-INDUCED SNHL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE PREVENTIONS AND TREATMENTS. THE RESEARCH PROPOSES A SYSTEMIC EVALUATION OF VIRAL EFFECTS ON THE INNER EAR USING MUMPS VIRUS (MUV), A HUMAN VIRUS THAT CAUSES SNHL AFTER BIRTH (ACQUIRED SNHL), AND MURINE CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (MCMV) TO UNDERSTAND HUMAN CMV DISEASE THAT CAUSES SNHL DURING EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT (CONGENITAL SNHL). THERE IS NO SMALL ANIMAL MODEL TO ASSESS SNHL CAUSED BY MUV. IN AIM1, IT IS PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH NOVEL IN VIVO MOUSE MODELS TO ASSESS HOW MCMV AND MUV INFECTIONS AFFECT INNER EAR CELLS. INFECTION WILL BE DONE LOCALLY AND CONTROLLED VIA THE POSTERIOR SEMICIRCULAR CANAL. THE ONSET AND EXTENT OF HEARING LOSS WILL BE MEASURED BY AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSE AND DISTORTION PRODUCT OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS. HISTOCHEMISTRY WILL QUANTIFY APOPTOTIC CELLS, VIRUS-INFECTED CELLS, AND IMMUNE CELLS IN DEFINED ANATOMICAL LOCATIONS OF THE COCHLEA FROM APEX TO BASE. BECAUSE THE MODEL IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGHLY CONTROLLABLE, IT WILL BE OPTIMIZED SO THAT THE DETRIMENTAL MECHANISMS OF DIFFERENT VIRUSES CAN BE COMPARED TO ADVANCE THE MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF VIRUS-INDUCED SNHL. AIM2 FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING THE ETIOLOGY OF THE TISSUE DAMAGE -DIRECT VIRAL INFECTION OR IMMUNE RESPONSE- IN MCMV- AND MUV- ADMINISTRATED COCHLEAE, AND TO ANALYZE THE MECHANISMS AT THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LEVEL. SUSCEPTIBLE CELL SUBTYPES WILL BE QUANTIFIED IN P2 AND P21 MICE INJECTED WITH MCMV AND MUV BEFORE AND AFTER THE ONSET OF HEARING LOSS BY USING KNOWN AND RECENTLY IDENTIFIED MARKERS. THESE INCLUDE NEW PERICOCHLEAR CELL SUBTYPES IN THE NEONATAL COCHLEA THAT WERE RECENTLY REPORTED BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR (PI), AS WELL AS THE NEW SUBTYPES OF TYPE I SPIRAL GANGLION CELLS. THE EXPRESSION OF A GANGLIOSIDE CALLED GM2, A MUV RECEPTOR WHICH THE PI IDENTIFIED IN A PREVIOUS STUDY, AND VARIOUS VIRAL HOST FACTORS WILL BE ALSO QUANTIFIED IN EACH COCHLEAR CELL SUBTYPE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CORRELATION WITH CELLULAR DAMAGE. FURTHER, THE TYPES AND NUMBERS OF INFILTRATING IMMUNE CELLS POST PSC INJECTION OF MCMV AND MUV IN P2 AND P21 MICE WILL BE ASSESSED WITH FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS WITH CELL TYPE-SPECIFIC MARKERS. TOGETHER, COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL DETAILS OF THE MECHANISM OF SNHL CAUSED BY MCMV AND MUV, AND WILL ESTABLISH A PROTOCOL THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER HEARING LOSS-CAUSING VIRUSES SUCH AS LASSA VIRUS, WHICH IS NOT SUITABLE FOR ANIMAL MODEL DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH BIOSAFETY LEVEL.

RECENT WORK IN CHILDREN WITH MILD-TO-SEVERE HEARING LOSS (I.E., CHILDREN WHO ARE HARD-OF-HEARING [CHH]) WHO WEAR HEARING AIDS SUGGESTS THAT THE DEGREE OF LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT CORRELATES WITH AUDITORY DOSAGE, DEFINED BY BOTH THE DEGREE TO WHICH A HEARING AID PROVIDES ACCESS TO SPEECH AND THE AMOUNT OF HEARING AID USE. NONETHELESS, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUDITORY ACCESS (I.E., HEARING LOSS AND AUDITORY DOSAGE) AND LANGUAGE FUNCTION IS STILL UNCLEAR. FURTHER, THE IMPACT OF AUDITORY ACCESS ON LANGUAGE-RELATED NEURAL OSCILLATORY DYNAMICS IS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN. THE PROPOSED EARLY-CAREER R21 PROJECT WILL PROVIDE PIVOTAL NEW DATA ON THE IMPACT OF VARIABILITY IN AUDITORY ACCESS ON MULTIPLE TIERS OF LANGUAGE FUNCTION AND NEURONAL DYNAMICS IN SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN.

HOWEVER, THERE EXIST NO VALID, RELIABLE, CLINICALLY PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR DIRECTLY MEASURING GAINS IN CONVERSATION, THE MOST FREQUENT COMMUNICATIVE ACTIVITY OF DAILY LIFE IN OLDER ADULTS. THE LONG-RANGE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO PROVIDE A THEORETICALLY GROUNDED, PRACTICAL, AUTOMATED TOOL FOR CLINICIANS AND CLINICAL RESEARCHERS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN TRANSACTIONAL SUCCESS IN CONVERSATION WITHOUT TRANSCRIBING AND ANALYZING APHASIC DISCOURSE, A TIME- AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE SKILL THAT HINDERS THE INCLUSION OF CONVERSATIONAL DISCOURSE IN TREATMENT OUTCOMES.

UP TO 75% OF CHILDHOOD HEARING LOSS IN LMICS IS PREVENTABLE DUE TO THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF INFECTION-RELATED HEARING LOSS. SCHOOL HEARING SCREENING IS CRITICAL FOR IDENTIFICATION OF CHILDHOOD HEARING LOSS IN LOW RESOURCE SETTINGS, WHERE NEWBORN SCREENING IS UNAVAILABLE. HOWEVER, MOST SCREENING PROGRAMS ONLY USE PURE-TONE SCREENING THAT DOES NOT IDENTIFY MIDDLE EAR DISEASE WIDESPREAD IN POPULATIONS WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE OF INFECTION-RELATED HEARING LOSS. THIS IS BECAUSE TYMPANOMETRY, USED TO CLINICALLY IDENTIFY MIDDLE EAR DISEASE, IS EXPENSIVE AND DESIGNED FOR TRAINED PROFESSIONALS. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE AN MHEALTH TYMPANOMETER WITH MACHINE LEARNING DIAGNOSTIC SUPPORT TO TRANSFORM THIS TECHNOLOGY INTO A LOW-COST TOOL THAT COULD BE BROADLY DISSEMINATED IN LMICS, WHERE THE BURDEN OF HEARING LOSS IS GREATEST AND IS NOT ADDRESSED BY CURRENT HEARING SCREENING METHODOLOGY.

HEARING LOSS IS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS HIGHER RATE OF DEPRESSION, SOCIAL ISOLATION, AND COGNITIVE DECLINE (E.G., DEMENTIA). MANY DIVERSE AND NOVEL THERAPEUTIC METHODS ARE DEVELOPED TO TREAT HEARING LOSS, BUT ONE COMMON CHALLENGE THAT THEY ALL SHARE IS HOW TO SAFELY DELIVER THERAPEUTICS TO THE INNER EAR. OFTEN, NON-INVASIVE METHODS TO DELIVER DRUGS TO THE INNER EAR CANNOT PENETRATE THE INNER EAR\u2019S BARRIERS, AND CONSEQUENTLY, ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE DRUG REACHES ITS TARGET. ALTERNATIVELY, INVASIVE SURGICAL METHODS SUCH AS DIRECT INJECTION TO THE INNER EAR COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE CELLS THAT POPULATE THE INNER EAR. ALTHOUGH RODENT MODELS VASTLY EXPANDED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HEARING LOSS AND ITS TREATMENT AT A MOLECULAR LEVEL, RODENT MODELS ARE LESS SUITABLE TO ADDRESS THE DRUG DELIVERY PROBLEM. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE SIZE OF THE RODENT\u2019S INNER EAR, AND THE THICKNESS OF ITS PROTECTIVE BARRIERS DO NOT MATCH THE HUMAN\u2019S, THEREFORE, EVALUATION OF THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF NEW DRUG DELIVERY METHODS USING RODENT MODELS IS CHALLENGING.

VOICE PRODUCTION IS A COMPLEX BIOPHYSICAL PROCESS, CONSISTING OF VOCAL FOLD BIOMECHANICS AND SUB-GLOTTAL, INTRA-GLOTTAL, AND SUPRA-GLOTTAL AERODYNAMICS, AS WELL AS THEIR INTERACTIONS. PREDICTIVE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING APPROACHES ARE HIGHLY NEEDED AS THEY PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC TOOLS FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE DETAILED FUNCTION OF SUCH A SOPHISTICATED COUPLED SYSTEM. THEY CAN BE EMPLOYED TO STUDY THE NORMAL FUNCTION OF VOICE PRODUCTION AND INVESTIGATE HOW IT CAN BE IMPACTED DUE TO AN ANOMALY OR MALFUNCTION IN THE VOCAL FOLD STRUCTURE OR BEHAVIOR. EXPERIMENTAL DATA OF HIGH-SPEED VIDEOENDOSCOPY, ELECTROGLOTTOGRAPHY AND ACOUSTIC SIGNALS WILL BE USED TO DESIGN COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF VOICE PRODUCTION, COUPLING LARYNGEAL DYNAMICS AND AERODYNAMICS. IN AIM 1, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP BAYESIAN PREDICTIVE MODELS THAT CAN CAPTURE THE UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN THE DATA AND MODELS. THE BAYESIAN INFERENCE WILL BE PERFORMED USING THE HIGH-SPEED VIDEOENDOSCOPY AND ELECTROGLOTTOGRAPHY DATA. THE MODELS WILL BE VALIDATED WITH ACOUSTIC SIGNALS FOR EACH VOCALLY NORMAL PARTICIPANT. THE MODEL WILL COUPLE THE VOCAL FOLD TISSUE VIBRATION (KINETICS AND KINEMATICS) WITH THE INSTANTANEOUSLY INTERACTING AERODYNAMICS OF GLOTTAL AIRFLOW TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FLOW- STRUCTURE INTERACTION DURING PHONATION. IN AIM 2, THE GOAL IS TO DESIGN PATIENT-SPECIFIC COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF VOICE PRODUCTION FOR PATIENTS WITH STRUCTURAL VOICE PATHOLOGIES INCLUDING VOCAL POLYPS, REINKE'S EDEMA, AND LARYNGITIS.

OUR STUDIES WILL TEST AN IMPORTANT MECHANISTIC QUESTION: THE EXTENT TO WHICH LINKED PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR LEARNING OF SPEECH-LIKE VOCALIZATIONS IN INFANTS WITH DIFFERENT HISTORIES OF SOCIAL-VOCAL EXPERIENCE IS REGULATED BY CONTINGENT PAIRINGS OF BABBLING WITH SOCIAL-VOCAL REINFORCEMENT BY CAREGIVERS. CONTINGENT PAIRINGS OF A SIGNAL WITH A REINFORCER INDUCE LEARNING OF A PREDICTION IN MODELS OF ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING. THUS WHEN SOCIAL-VOCAL REWARD BY CAREGIVERS IS CONTINGENT ON BABBLING, INFANTS LEARN THAT THEIR UTTERANCES PREDICT SOCIAL REINFORCEMENT ACCOMPANIED BY MATURE VOCAL PATTERNS AND BEGIN TO PRODUCE SPEECH-LIKE FORMS THAT EMULATE THE PHONOLOGICAL PATTERN PROVIDED BY CAREGIVERS.

THESE BENEFITS MAY BE DUE TO REPRESENTATION OF LOW-FREQUENCY INFORMATION CLOSER TO THE NORMAL COCHLEAR PLACE. FURTHERMORE, STIMULATION DEEPER THAN ONE COCHLEAR TURN MAY PROVIDE BETTER PERCEPTION OF TEMPORAL INFORMATION AND BETTER SOUND QUALITY. HOWEVER, USING LONGER ELECTRODE ARRAYS TO ACCESS DEEP APICAL REGIONS HAS SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES. FIRST, BECAUSE THE SCALA TYMPANI DIAMETER DECREASES WITH INCREASING COCHLEAR DEPTH, THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN INCOMPLETE INSERTION INCREASES WITH ELECTRODE ARRAY LENGTH. SECOND, IF DEEPER INSERTION IS ACHIEVED, THE PROBABILITY OF DAMAGE TO COCHLEAR STRUCTURES INCREASES AS THE WALLS OF THE COCHLEAR DUCT BECOME CLOSER TO THE ELECTRODE. THIRD, EVEN THE LONGEST ELECTRODES ONLY STIMULATE ~70% OF THE COCHLEAR LENGTH.

CHILDREN WHO SPEAK NONMAINSTREAM DIALECTS MAY BE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGED BY THE COMPLEXITIES CREATED BY DIALECT DIFFERENCES IN LANGUAGE TESTING ENVIRONMENTS. THERE IS A LARGE BODY OF WORK DOCUMENTING THESE CHALLENGES FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN. WHILE MODIFICATIONS OF EXISTING LANGUAGE TESTS HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR QUITE SOME TIME, THESE MODIFICATIONS USUALLY INVOLVE EITHER GIVING CHILDREN CREDIT FOR ITEMS INFLUENCED BY DIALECT OR SKIPPING THESE ITEMS ALTOGETHER.

IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THE MEASUREMENT OF LANGUAGE CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE MEASUREMENT OF DIALECT, WHICH IS A VARIATION ON THAT LANGUAGE. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT ITEMS OF EXISTING LANGUAGE TESTS MEASURE CRUCIAL FEATURES OF LANGUAGE AND THAT SOME ITEMS MEASURE CRUCIAL FEATURES OF DIALECT, BUT THE RELATION BETWEEN THE FACTORS OF LANGUAGE AND DIALECT REMAINS UNCLEAR. LINGUISTICALLY, WE KNOW MANY FEATURES OF LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT OVERLAP WITH AA DIALECT.

ACQUIRED HEARING LOSS CAN ALSO BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS OTHER INSULTS INCLUDING ACOUSTIC TRAUMA, AMINOGLYCOSIDES, AND AGING. DESPITE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON THE MECHANISMS OF HEARING LOSS, CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO FDA APPROVED DRUGS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET TO PROTECT AGAINST CISPLATIN-, NOISE-, AMINOGLYCOSIDE-INDUCED OR AGE-RELATED HEARING LOSS. THUS, IDENTIFYING NOVEL THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS FOR HEARING LOSS IS AN IMMEDIATE UNMET NEED. RECENTLY CONDUCTED UNBIASED HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN A COCHLEAR CELL LINE IDENTIFIED CYCLIN DEPENDENT KINASE-2 (CDK2) AS AN IMPORTANT THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR CISPLATIN-INDUCED CELL DEATH AND HEARING LOSS. CDK2-DEFICIENT MICE ALSO DISPLAYED ENHANCED RESISTANCE TO CISPLATIN TOXICITY IN COCHLEAR EXPLANTS AND TO CISPLATIN- OR NOISE-INDUCED HEARING LOSS IN VIVO.

GLOBAL SPEECH MODIFICATION STRATEGIES (E.G., USING A LOUD VOICE OR SLOW RATE) HAVE SHOWN PROMISE FOR IMPROVING INTELLIGIBILITY IN THIS POPULATION; HOWEVER, CHILDREN WITH CP ARE HETEROGENEOUS IN THEIR COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND MOTOR ABILITIES, AND THEY DO NOT ALL BENEFIT FROM THESE STRATEGIES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SPEECH MODIFICATION STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN WITH CP IS CURRENTLY LIMITED BY A LACK OF RESEARCH COMPARING THE EFFICACY OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE STRATEGIES LEAD TO INTELLIGIBILITY GAINS.

ALTHOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING RECEPTIVE PROSODY IN ASD HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR DECADES, THE LITERATURE REMAINS RELATIVELY SMALL AND FINDINGS OFTEN INCONCLUSIVE. ONE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF RECEPTIVE PROSODY, WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED, IS THE VARIABILITY OF HUMAN SPEECH. DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE, GENDER, AND OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS, TALKERS CAN DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY IN HOW THEY USE PROSODY TO EXPRESS MEANING. RECEPTIVE PROSODY THEREFORE NEEDS TO BE ADAPTIVE, COMPENSATING FOR THESE DIFFERENCES. THIS INSIGHT HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ASD, WHOSE PERCEPTION HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE HIGHLY ACCURATE LOCALLY AND LESS IMPACTED BY TOP-DOWN KNOWLEDGE AND GLOBAL CHANGES IN STATISTICS. IF THEIR RECEPTIVE PROSODY IS NOT APPROPRIATELY MODULATED ACCORDING TO THE ACROSS-TALKER VARIABILITY THAT IS UBIQUITOUS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE, IT WOULD SEVERELY LIMIT THE ACCURACY OF THEIR COMPREHENSION.

EXPERIMENTS PROPOSED HERE CAPITALIZE ON A RECENT INNOVATION MADE BY OUR TEAM, TESTING ADAPTATION OF RECEPTIVE GRAMMATICAL AND PRAGMATIC PROSODY IN LARGE SAMPLES OF NEUROTYPICAL (NT) ADULTS. OUR RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT, WHEN EXPOSED TO A NOVEL TALKER WHOSE PROSODIC PRODUCTIONS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS NORMALLY EXPECTED GIVEN THE GENERAL STATISTICS OF THE INPUT, ADULT LISTENERS ROBUSTLY RECALIBRATE HOW THEY CATEGORIZE THE TALKER\u2019S MEANING (E.G., IS THIS A STATEMENT OR A QUESTION?)

MET TAKES PLACE AT THE LEVEL OF THE HAIR BUNDLE AND IS MEDIATED BY TIP LINKS, EXTRACELLULAR PROTEINS CONNECTING SHORTER STEREOCILIA TO ADJACENT TALLER STEREOCILIA. A POSITIVE DEFLECTION OF THE HAIR BUNDLE (TOWARD THE TALLEST ROW OF STEREOCILIA) INCREASES TIP-LINK TENSION, WHICH INCREASES THE OPEN PROBABILITY OF MET CHANNELS.

OUR VISION IS TO PROVIDE GOOD QUALITY, AFFORDABLE, AND SUSTAINABLE HEARING HEALTH CARE TO UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN LMICS AND AROUND THE WORLD. WE PROPOSE TO VALIDATE AND THEN TRIAL AN INNOVATIVE MHEALTH MODEL FOR END-TO-END HEARING CARE FACILITATED BY COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHWS).

INTERESTINGLY, LINEAGE IMPLICATIONS FROM RNASEQ BASED APPROACHED IN MOUSE AND HUMAN LUNG STUDIES SUGGEST A POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCCS AND OTHER RARE AIRWAY CELL TYPES INCLUDING THE IONOCYTE AND THE NEUROENDOCRINE CELL.  OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT HUMAN SCCS ENCOMPASS A HETEROGENEOUS POPULATION THAT IS MODULATED IN THE ALLERGIC INFLAMMATORY SETTING, AND UNIQUELY EXPRESS CELL-SPECIFIC CHEMOSENSORY RECEPTORS TO DETECT HUMAN DISEASE-ASSOCIATED COMPOUNDS.

EFFECTIVE CODING OF THE DYNAMIC SPEECH SIGNAL DURING DEVELOPMENT PARTIALLY DRIVES CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT, AND AUDITORY NEURAL DEFICITS CONTRIBUTE TO LIFELONG LISTENING DISABILITIES. WHILE THERE ARE METHODS FOR MEASURING RESPONSES FROM THE BRAINSTEM BY THE AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSE (ABR) AND FROM THE CORTEX (CENTRAL AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIALS [CAEP]) IN INFANTS, ONLY VERY SHORT SOUNDS CAN BE USED TO EVOKE THEM WHICH LACK THE COMPLEXITY AND RICHNESS OF NATURAL SPEECH. MEASUREMENT OF AUDITORY RESPONSES TO CONTINUOUS, NATURAL SPEECH MEASURED FROM THE PERIPHERY THROUGH THE BRAINSTEM AND CORTEX OPENS THE DOOR FOR A BROAD SPECTRUM OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRIES INCLUDING SPEECH PERCEPTION, LANGUAGE ACQUISITION, AND AUDITORY PROCESSING DEFICITS UNDERLYING VARIOUS TYPES OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS. DESPITE THE TRADITIONAL STIMULUS LIMITATIONS, THE DECREASE IN ABR AND CAEP WAVE LATENCIES AND THE INCREASE IN WAVE AMPLITUDES WITH INCREASING INFANT AGE IS USED AS A MEASURE OF MATURATION OF BRAINSTEM MYELINATION AND CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT FOR SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL PURPOSES. TYPICALLY, ONLY ONE OR THE OTHER IS MEASURED, BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE DIFFERENT ACQUISITION PROTOCOLS.

IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL VALIDATE THE TECHNIQUE IN NEWBORNS AND YOUNG INFANTS, AND DEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BRAINSTEM AND CORTICAL RESPONSES OVER THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF LIFE.

THIS QUESTION CANNOT BE ANSWERED EFFECTIVELY IN HUMAN SUBJECTS BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY MANIPULATE HEARING LOSS. THEREFORE, IN THE CURRENT STUDY, WE EMPLOY TWO ANIMAL MODELS OF AD (A MODEL OF SPORADIC AND A MODEL OF FAMILIAL AD) AND ASK WHETHER MANIPULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL AUDITORY SYSTEM ALTERS AD PATHOLOGY. TO DO THIS, WE EMPLOY A NOVEL MODEL OF SPORADIC AD THAT IS BASED ON CELL-CYCLE DYSREGULATION \u2013 A PHENOMENON THAT IS COMMONLY OBSERVED IN BRAIN SPECIMENS FROM AD PATIENTS.

AS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD DEVELOPING EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE FOR MANAGING PATIENTS WITH USH, THIS STUDY EVALUATES LOCAL NEURAL HEALTH, AS WELL AS THE NEURAL ENCODING OF TEMPORAL AND SPECTRAL CUES AT THE CN IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USH. AIM 1 WILL DETERMINE LOCAL CN HEALTH IN PATIENTS WITH USH BY ASSESSING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ELECTRICALLY EVOKED COMPOUND ACTION POTENTIAL TO CHANGES IN INTERPHASE GAP AND PULSE POLARITY. AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE GROUP DIFFERENCES IN NEURAL ENCODING OF TEMPORAL AND SPECTRAL CUES AT THE CN BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH USH AND PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC HEARING LOSS.

RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ALSO HAVE HIGH CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE THEY WILL 1) LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE, EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR MANAGING PATIENTS WITH USH, AND 2) YIELD AN OBJECTIVE TOOL FOR ASSESSING THE SITE-SPECIFIC ELECTRODE-NEURON INTERFACE IN ALL CI USERS, WHICH IS FOUNDATIONAL FOR CREATING OPTIMAL PROGRAMMING MAPS FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "18478032-6084-4969-2e94-0f121ba8b8b2-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC019458_7529"}, {"internal_id": 126270889, "Award ID": "R21DC019457", "Award Amount": 434562.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-02-17", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "HIGH-RESOLUTION LOCALIZATION OF THE HAIR CELL MECHANOTRANSDUCTION CHANNEL COMPONENTS BY IMMUNOGOLD-SCANNING ELECTRONIC MICROSCOPY - SUMMARY OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL HOW HAIR CELL MECHANOTRANSDUCTION WORKS AND WHY IT FAILS IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEARING LOSS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO STUDY GENES THAT CAUSE HEARING LOSS IN HUMANS BY MODELING THEM IN MICE. A CRITICAL ASPECT OF THIS RESEARCH RELIES ON LOCALIZING DEAFNESS PROTEINS AT CELLULAR AND SUBCELLULAR LEVELS IN THE INNER EAR. IN THE HAIR CELL MECHANOSENSORY ORGANELLE, KNOWN AS THE HAIR BUNDLE, HIGH- RESOLUTION LOCALIZATION OF PROTEINS PROVIDES CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR DEFINING THEIR FUNCTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MECHANOTRANSDUCTION MACHINERY ITSELF IS ORGANIZED ASYMMETRICALLY ALONG THE TIP LINK ENDS. TIP LINK NANOFILAMENTS TRANSMIT THE DEFLECTION FORCE FROM TALLER STEREOCILIA TO THE TIPS OF PAIRED, SHORTER STEREOCILIA IN ORDER TO GATE THE CHANNEL. THEREFORE, A PROTEIN LOCALIZED AT THE UPPER TIP-LINK INSERTION COMPLEX INDICATES A POTENTIAL ROLE IN TIP-LINK TENSION MAINTENANCE. IN CONTRAST, A PROTEIN LOCALIZED AT THE LOWER TIP-LINK INSERTION SITE SUGGESTS A ROLE WITH THE MECHANO-ELECTRICAL TRANSDUCER (MET) CHANNEL COMPLEX. HIGH-RESOLUTION PROTEIN LOCALIZATION IS ROUTINELY ACHIEVED BY IMMUNOGOLD-LABELING OF SAMPLES, WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY EMBEDDED, SLICED, AND IMAGED USING TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPES. HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH IS MASSIVELY TIME-CONSUMING AND NOT SUITED FOR EXTENSIVE QUANTIFICATION. AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IMAGES THE SURFACE OF IMMUNOGOLD-LABELED SAMPLES USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM), HOWEVER THIS METHOD IS LIMITED TO INVESTIGATING EXTRACELLULAR PROTEINS. AS MANY PROTEINS OF THE HAIR BUNDLE ARE INTERNAL BUT IN THE VICINITY OF THE MEMBRANE, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT IMMUNOGOLD-SEM COULD BE ADAPTED TO LOCALIZE THESE INTERNAL PROTEINS. SUCH A TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENT WOULD ALLOW LOCALIZATION OF PROTEIN DISTRIBUTION AT THE NANOSCALE FROM LARGE NUMBERS OF HAIR CELLS, RESULTING IN INCREASED SAMPLE NUMBERS FOR STRONGER QUANTIFICATION.

THIS ALSO MEANS THAT KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS EXIST IN THE OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN SENSORY ORGANS. IN THE CASE OF THE INNER EAR, IT IS KNOWN THAT PROPER CELL FATE COMMITMENT TO THE OTIC PLACODE IS ESSENTIAL FOR INNER EAR FORMATION. BOTH SENSORY EPITHELIA, WHERE HAIR CELLS ARE LOCATED, AND THE VESTIBULOCOCHLEAR NERVE ARE DERIVED FROM THE OTIC VESICLE, WHICH IS INVAGINATED FROM THE OTIC PLACODE; DEFECTS IN HAIR CELLS AND/OR THE VESTIBULOCOCHLEAR NERVE RESULT IN SNHL.

WITH INCREASING GLOBALIZATION, FOREIGN-ACCENTED SPEECH OCCURS REGULARLY IN REAL-WORLD HUMAN COMMUNICATION AND IS OFTEN A CAUSE OF MISCOMMUNICATION. YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW NON-NATIVE SPEECH ALTERS THE MECHANISMS OF SPEECH RECOGNITION. TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS THAT SUPPORT ACCENTED-SPEECH RECOGNITION AND THEIR LANGUAGE-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY, 60 MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS FROM THREE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE BACKGROUNDS (NATIVE ENGLISH MONOLINGUAL, SPANISH-ENGLISH BILINGUAL, AND MANDARIN-ENGLISH BILINGUAL) ARE TESTED ON ACCENTED-SPEECH RECOGNITION, THE FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSE (FFR), AND A BATTERY OF COGNITIVE AND LINGUISTIC MEASURES. THE ACCENTED-SPEECH RECOGNITION TEST USES SENTENCES OF VARYING LINGUISTIC COMPLEXITY SPOKEN BY NATIVE-ENGLISH MONOLINGUALS, SPANISH-ENGLISH BILINGUALS, AND MANDARIN- ENGLISH BILINGUALS, ALLOWING EVALUATION OF NON-NATIVE SPEECH RECOGNITION IN INDIVIDUALS WHOSE LANGUAGE BACKGROUNDS EITHER MATCH OR DO NOT MATCH THE TALKERS. THE FFR IS A NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO COMPLEX AUDITORY STIMULI THAT PROVIDES FINE-GRAINED DETAIL ABOUT HOW MULTIFACETED, OVERLAPPING COMPONENTS OF SOUND (E.G., FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY AND HARMONICS) ARE TRANSFORMED INTO DISCRETE NEURAL COMPONENTS.

CIS RESTORE HEARING BY ELECTRICALLY STIMULATING RESIDUAL VIABLE AUDITORY NERVE FIBERS IN THE COCHLEA WITH AN IMPLANTED ELECTRODE ARRAY. HOWEVER, COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION IS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY SURGICAL INJURY, WHICH INITIATES AN ACUTE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE TO THE ELECTRODE AND INDUCES ON-SET AND PROGRESSIVE LOSS OF RESIDUAL ACOUSTIC HEARING. THUS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP A REAL-TIME MONITORING METHOD TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE NEURAL CONDITIONS DURING AND AFTER IMPLANTATION AND SUBSEQUENT HEARING LOSS TO ENHANCE POST-OPERATIVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES. INFLAMMATORY PROCESS INDUCES OXIDATIVE STRESS (I.E. AN ELEVATED INTRACELLULAR LEVEL OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)) AND REDUCES CELLULAR ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT OXIDATIVE STRESS PLAYS KEY ROLES FOR CHRONIC NEUROINFLAMMATION. THEREFORE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT OXIDATIVE STRESS IS THE MAJOR FACTOR COMPROMISING CIS\u2019 CLINICAL OUTCOME. IN THIS R21 PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP NOVEL MULTIFUNCTIONAL CI ELECTRODES AND METHODS THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY MONITOR AND SCAVENGE INITIATION OF THE OXIDATIVE STRESS PATHWAY DURING AND AFTER COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION. WE WILL DEVELOP THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL CIS TO ACHIEVE REAL-TIME IN VIVO SENSING AND SCAVENGING OF ROS WITH CLINICALLY REQUIRED SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY. OUR APPROACH TO DEVELOP ADVANCED MULTIFUNCTIONAL CIS IS TO UTILIZE THE UNIQUE PALLADIUM (PD) AND PD BIMETALLIC (I.E. PD/AU) NANOPARTICLES THAT SHOW ENZYME-LIKE ACTIVITIES ALLOWING SENSITIVE AND SELECTIVE SENSING OF ROS AS WELL AS CONVERTING ROS TO NEUTRAL MOLECULES.

THE SIMULTANEOUS NEUTRALIZATION OF ROS WITH THEIR ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSING REACTIONS SHOULD MITIGATE OXIDATIVE STRESS-RELATED CELL DEATH WITHOUT DISRUPTING THE WELL- INTEGRATED INNATE ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE NETWORK, THUS, IMPROVING POST-OPERATIVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CIS.

PEER-MEDIATED INTERVENTIONS (PMIS) ARE A WIDELY-USED AND EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH TO TEACH SOCIAL COMMUNICATION TO YOUNG CHILDREN WITH ASD. RECENT REPORTS HAVE DOCUMENTED THE BENEFITS OF INCORPORATING AUGMENTATIVE AND ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION (E.G., SPEECH-GENERATING DEVICES) INTO PMIS TO INCREASE COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH PEERS IN INCLUSIVE SETTTINGS. CHILDREN'S SOCIAL COMPETENCE WITH PEERS IS CONSIDERED A FUNDAMENTAL DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO LATER LANGUAGE, SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. TO DATE, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF STUDIES IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC CHILD VARIABLES THAT PREDICT CHILD RESPONSE TO PMIS. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL ATTENTION (I.E., VISUAL ATTENTION/SCANNING OF SOCIAL STIMULI) FOR CHILDREN WITH ASD COMPARED TO TYPICALLY-DEVELOPING CHILDREN. IT IS PROBABLE THAT AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH ASD, VARIABILITY IN PERFORMANCE ON MEASURES OF SOCIAL ATTENTION (I.E., VISUAL ATTENTION TO THE FACE) AND INTEREST IN PEERS (I.E., SHOWING JOINT ATTENTION AND IMITATION) MAY BE IMPORTANT PREDICTORS OF RESPONSE TO PMIS. MEASURING PROXIMAL BEHAVIORS SUCH AS SOCIAL ATTENTION AND PEER INTEREST MOVES BEYOND PRIOR EFFORTS FOCUSING ON MORE GLOBAL CHILD VARIABLES (E.G., COGNITIVE SKILLS) AND SHOULD ALLOW FOR IDENTIFYING THOSE CHILDREN WHO REQUIRE TAILORING OF PMIS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS INNOVATIVE STUDY IS TO EXAMINE POTENTIAL CHILD VARIABLES THAT PREDICT RESPONSE TO PMI FOR PRESCHOOLERS WITH ASD (N=40) WITH LIMITED TO NO SPOKEN COMMUNICATION.

THE LABELED TB CELLS WERE MAINLY TYPE III THAT TRANSDUCE A SOUR AND A SALT TASTE, AND HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVEL OF PAN-TASTE CELL MARKER KRT8. FURTHER STUDIES ON THE TISSUE LOCATIONS AND LINEAGE MAPPING OF SOX10+ CELLS HAVE LED TO THE IDEA THAT VON EBNER'S GLAND (VEG) IS THE TISSUE NEST OF SOX10+ PROGENITORS FOR TB CELLS IN THE CVP. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE REPORT THAT TBS-CONTAINING \u201cCIRCULAR STRUCTURES\u201d FORMED WHERE VEG DUCTS LOCATE IN TRANSPLANTED CVP TISSUE.  THE GOAL OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO COLLECT DIRECT AND SOLID EVIDENCE ABOUT WHETHER SOX10+ DUCTAL CELLS OF VEGS MIGRATE AND DIFFERENTIATE TO TB CELLS (AIM 1), AND ESTABLISH THE TRANSCRIPTOMIC PROFILES OF CVP/VEG EPITHELIAL CELLS, INCLUDING SOX10+ PROGENITORS AND THEIR DERIVED TB CELLS (AIM 2). IN AIM 1, WE WILL ADOPT THE PREVIOUSLY PROVEN APPROACHES FOR EXAMINING TASTE CELL DIFFERENTIATION - THE 3D CULTURES OF DISSOCIATED CELLS AND CVP/VEG TRANSPLANTATIONS.

IN AIM 2, WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE POWER OF A MODERN HIGH-THROUGHPUT TECHNIQUE, SINGLE CELL (SC) RNA-SEQ THAT ENABLES A HIGHLY EFFICIENT AND INFORMATIVE ANALYSIS, TO ESTABLISH THE TRANSCRIPTOMIC PROFILES OF ALL TYPES OF CVP/VEG EPITHELIAL CELLS INCLUDING SOX10+ PROGENITORS IN VEGS AND DERIVED TB CELLS. THE YIELDED DATA WILL PROVIDE DEFINITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENTIATION OF SOX10+ VEG CELLS TO TB CELLS AND BRING COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION OF GENE EXPRESSION FOR ALL CVP TB CELLS AND SURROUNDING EPITHELIAL CELLS INCLUDING THOSE TB PROGENITORS SUCH AS SOX10+ VEG DUCTAL CELLS.

HOWEVER, THE PATHWAY IN WHICH HUMANS EXPERIENCE PLASTICITY OF THE SWEET TASTE PERCEPTION HAS YET TO BE ELUCIDATED.

THE OVERALL RESEARCH GOAL OF THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE OF SWEET TASTE RECEPTOR BIOLOGY IN HUMANS, IN TERMS OF DIETARY INTAKE, TASTE PERCEPTION, AND INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT GREATER EXPOSURE TO SWEET FOODS AND BEVERAGES WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER SWEET TASTE FUNCTION AND REDUCED EXPRESSION OF THE SWEET TASTE RECEPTOR GENE.

PROJECT SUMMARY THE CAPACITY OF THE ADULT OLFACTORY EPITHELIUM (OE) FOR RENEWING AND REGENERATING THE POPULATION OF SENSORY NEURONS DEPENDS ON THE PERSISTENCE AND PROPER FUNCTION OF STEM CELLS. PRESBYOSMIA IS ACCOMPANIED BY PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES DUE TO THE DISORDERING AND EVENTUAL DEPLETION OF THE NORMALLY ACTIVE OLFACTORY STEM AND PROGENITOR CELLS, NAMELY GLOBOSE BASAL CELLS (GBCS). IN THIS SETTING, THE RESERVE STEM CELLS, NAMELY THE HORIZONTAL BASAL CELLS (HBCS), REMAIN DORMANT DESPITE THE NEUROGENIC EXHAUSTION AND DISAPPEARANCE OF GBCS. IN CONTRAST, IF THE OE IS DAMAGED BY AN OLFACTOTOXIN, THE HBCS ACTIVATE AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPAIR OF THE EPITHELIUM. THE RESULTS OF HBC ACTIVATION ARE STRONGLY CONTEXT-DEPENDENT AND DO NOT ALWAYS CAPACITATE THE REJUVENATION OF NEUROGENESIS. THAT FAILURE CAN OCCUR IN RODENTS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF EITHER EXPERIMENTAL LESION OR AGING/NEUROGENIC EXHAUSTION. SUBSTANTIAL INDIRECT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE HUMAN OE. A THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY THAT DIRECTS HBCS DOWN THE PATHWAY TOWARD NEURONAL REGENERATION IN THE SETTING OF AN EXHAUSTED OE OFFERS POSSIBLY THE BEST APPROACH FOR TREATING AGE-RELATED OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION.

THE UNDERLYING FRAMEWORK OF THESE PROCEDURES IS TO MODEL THE EAR CANAL AS AN ACOUSTIC WAVEGUIDE. SPATIAL VARIATION IN THE CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF THE EAR CANAL IS DESCRIBED ACOUSTICALLY BY QUANTIFYING FORWARD AND REVERSE SOUND WAVES TRAVELING BETWEEN A PROBE INSERTED INTO THE EAR CANAL AND A LOCATION NEAR THE TM. DESCRIBING THE SOUND FIELD NEAR THE TM IN TERMS OF SOUND PRESSURE AND ITS REFLECTED AND TRANSMITTED COMPONENTS MORE ACCURATELY QUANTIFIES THE ACOUSTICAL HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) INPUT TO THE MIDDLE EAR. SUCH A DESCRIPTION IMPROVES HF CALIBRATION OF THE STIMULUS NEAR THE TM FOR PHYSIOLOGICAL TESTS SUCH AS OTOACOUSTIC EMISSION AND AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSES, AND HF BEHAVIORAL TESTS SUCH AS EXTENDED AUDIOMETRY AND TESTS OF SPATIAL PROCESSING OF SOUND. THE SPECIFICATION ALSO IMPROVES THE ABILITY TO DESCRIBE FORWARD AND REVERSE OTOACOUSTIC EMISSION RESPONSES AT HFS, WHICH NON-INVASIVELY ENCODE INFORMATION ON OUTER-HAIR CELL FUNCTION WITHIN THE COCHLEA. THE PROJECT OUTCOMES WILL BENEFIT ACOUSTIC DIAGNOSTIC TESTS OF MIDDLE-EAR AND COCHLEAR FUNCTION. THE GOALS OF AIM 1 ARE TO: (I) IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE A CAUSAL, TIME-DOMAIN MEASUREMENT AT THE PROBE TIP OF THE ACOUSTIC REFLECTION FUNCTION (RF) OF THE EAR, SUCH THAT REFLECTANCE IS THE FOURIER TRANSFORM OF THE RF, (II) USE THE RF TO CALCULATE AREA-DISTANCE FUNCTIONS OF THE EAR CANAL BETWEEN THE PROBE TIP AND TM, AND (III) USE RF AND AREA DATA TO ESTIMATE THE SOUND FIELD NEAR THE TM (I.E., TO WITHIN 3.6 MM). CURRENT FREQUENCY- DOMAIN TESTS TO MEASURE REFLECTANCE ARE NOT CONSTRAINED TO OBEY CAUSALITY, WHICH LIMITS THEIR ACCURACY IN CLINICAL APPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY AT FREQUENCIES ABOVE 8 KHZ. CAUSALITY REQUIRES THAT SOUND CANNOT BE REFLECTED PRIOR TO ITS INCIDENCE. THE RF OF THE EAR IS A KEY RESPONSE FOR SUBSEQUENT AREA-DISTANCE CALCULATIONS WITHIN THE EAR CANAL. RF DATA WILL BE ACQUIRED IN AIM 1 EXPERIMENTS IN TUBING SYSTEMS WITH VARYING AREAS, MOLDS OF EAR CANALS AND AN ARTIFICIAL EAR SIMULATOR (IEC711 COUPLER).

ESTABLISHING THE RELATION BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND COGNITION IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF DLD AND FOR DEVELOPING APPROACHES TO IMPROVE COGNITION, WHICH IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE HIGHER-ORDER COGNITIVE SKILLS PREDICT LATER ACADEMIC AND CAREER SUCCESS. ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT CHILDREN WITH DLD HAVE COGNITIVE DEFICITS BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS SUCCESSFUL RELATIVE TO PEERS WITH TYPICAL LANGUAGE IN UTILIZING SELF-DIRECTED SPEECH (SDS; I.E., SPEECH TO ONESELF) TO REGULATE THEIR BEHAVIORS AND THOUGHTS. FOR EXAMPLE, CHILDREN WITH DLD MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO ARTICULATE STEPS WHILE PROBLEM SOLVING OR VERBALLY REHEARSE TASK RULES. AS SUCH, LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT MAY PLAY A CAUSAL ROLE IN HIGHER-ORDER COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN DLD VIA IMPAIRED SDS. SOCIOCULTURAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT SDS BEGINS AS EXTERNAL REGULATORY SPEECH FROM CAREGIVERS THAT CHILDREN INTERNALIZE TO DEVELOP SDS. IN THIS MODEL, EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT A CHILD\u2019S ABILITY TO PRODUCE SDS, AND RECEPTIVE LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENTS WOULD REDUCE A CHILD\u2019S ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND CAREGIVERS\u2019 EXTERNAL REGULATORY SPEECH, WHICH IS CENTRAL TO SDS DEVELOPMENT. FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED SDS IN DLD, BUT PREVIOUS RESEARCH INDICATES THAT CHILDREN WITH DLD HAVE IMMATURE SDS RELATIVE TO TYPICALLY DEVELOPING PEERS. HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO PROMISING EVIDENCE THAT SDS CAN BE TRAINED IN CHILDREN WITH DLD. ALTHOUGH CHILDREN WITH DLD SHOW IMMATURE SDS RELATIVE TO TYPICAL PEERS, LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH IN THIS AREA IS LACKING, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY AND DISCERN WHY CHILDREN WITH DLD LAG BEHIND TYPICAL PEERS. THE FIRST GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DOCUMENT THE LONGITUDINAL DEVELOPMENT OF SDS IN PRESCHOOLERS WITH AND WITHOUT DLD IN ORDER TO COMPARE THE GROUPS IN THEIR SDS AND PLANNING ABILITIES AND TO ASSESS THE RELATION BETWEEN THESE VARIABLES OVER TIME. THIS GOAL WILL BE ACHIEVED IN STUDY 1 IN WHICH PRESCHOOLERS WITH AND WITHOUT DLD WILL COMPLETE THE TOWER OF HANOI PLANNING TASK FOUR TIMES OVER ONE YEAR.

IF TASK PERFORMANCE DIFFERS ACROSS THE CONDITIONS, IT SUGGESTS THAT PLANNING IS AFFECTED BY INCREASING OR DECREASING SDS, SUPPORTING A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SDS AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE. THE THIRD GOAL IS TO TEST THE PREDICTIONS OF THE SOCIOCULTURAL MODEL WITH RESPECT TO THE EFFECTS OF EXPRESSIVE VERSUS RECEPTIVE-EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE DEFICITS ON SDS. THIS GOAL WILL BE ADDRESSED WITH DATA FROM CHILDREN WITH DLD FROM STUDIES 1 AND 2 BY COMPARING SDS DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN CHILDREN WITH EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT VERSUS THOSE WITH RECEPTIVE-EXPRESSIVE IMPAIRMENT.

GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR RESIDUAL HEARING DIFFICULTIES IN PATIENTS WITH MODERATE OR GREATER HEARING LOSS WHO ARE AMPLIFIED WITH A HEARING AID ONLY, A SUB-ANALYSIS, WILL BE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF TYPE OF AMPLIFICATION (I.E., HEARING AID VERSUS COCHLEAR IMPLANT) MODIFIES THE ODDS OF A FALL-RELATED INJURY IN THIS SUBGROUP WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THOSE WITH MODERATE OR GREATER HEARING LOSS RECEIVE GREATER AUDITORY BENEFIT FROM COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION AND THEREFORE, HAVE LOWER ODDS OF FALLING. 2) TO CONDUCT AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF OLDER ADULTS WITH HEARING LOSS TO IDENTIFY IF DIFFERENCES IN PATIENT-REPORTED HEARING OUTCOMES (E.G., LISTENING EFFORT, SPATIAL AWARENESS, HEARING HANDICAP), PATIENT-REPORTED AMPLIFICATION OUTCOMES, COGNITIVE AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FALLS RISK. VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE USED TO EXAMINE DIFFERENCES IN THESE DOMAINS BETWEEN FALLERS AND NON-FALLERS STRATIFIED BY AMPLIFICATION STATUS (USER VERSUS NON- USER) AND TYPE (HEARING AID VERSUS COCHLEAR IMPLANT). THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS INNOVATIVE AS THE WORK WILL DETERMINE IF HEARING INTERVENTION INFLUENCES THE RISK OF FALLS-INJURY IN OLDER ADULTS AND SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE DOSE-DEPENDENT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HEARING LOSS SEVERITY AND FALLS. MOREOVER, IT WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATE MECHANISMS THAT WILL FURTHER CLARIFY THE LINK BETWEEN FALLS AND HEARING LOSS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT AS THEY WILL DETERMINE IF HEARING LOSS MAY BE AN APPROPRIATE TARGET FOR INTERVENTION TO REDUCE THE SOCIETAL AND HEALTHCARE BURDEN OF FALLS AND FALLS-RELATED INJURY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6f191f83-6024-f2be-3012-4b740b10ac7a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC018616_7529"}, {"internal_id": 92603467, "Award ID": "R21DC018497", "Award Amount": 453439.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-12-03", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "TOWARDS MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF INVERTEBRATE GUSTATORY RECEPTORS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "cbfadf27-8176-30f2-9f5f-7e229ff247ef-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC018497_7529"}, {"internal_id": 95942591, "Award ID": "R21DC018496", "Award Amount": 415233.72, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-03-17", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "BACTERIAL FACTORS AND HOST RESPONSE IN CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "5d50a1e7-6c45-607b-669d-580246737467-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC018496_7529"}, {"internal_id": 107115572, "Award ID": "R21DC018408", "Award Amount": 416028.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-07-29", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "MODIFYING SPATIAL MAPS TO IMPROVE LOCALIZATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6ad8c5c3-8085-49bb-9227-fc5bc4a1f938-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC018408_7529"}, {"internal_id": 98486437, "Award ID": "R21DC018399", "Award Amount": 473047.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-06-26", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "MULTIFACTORIAL DETERMINANTS OF CHILDHOOD HEARING LOSS IN RURAL ALASKA", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d72b9a8b-635d-44cc-45e8-3f90e8ee45f3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC018399_7529"}, {"internal_id": 107115054, "Award ID": "R21DC018395", "Award Amount": 429000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-01", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "PENETRATING THE CLASSROOM SOCIAL NETWORK FOR CHILDREN WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT VIA PEER-MEDIATED INTERVENTION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "18478032-6084-4969-2e94-0f121ba8b8b2-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC018395_7529"}, {"internal_id": 90621217, "Award ID": "R21DC018390", "Award Amount": 466125.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-11-11", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "TREATMENT OF MAL DE DEBARQUEMENT SYNDROME (MDDS) BY HABITUATION OF VELOCITY STORAGE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bace221f-a1f9-fa20-66e4-55984406cf48-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC018390_7529"}, {"internal_id": 116435402, "Award ID": "R21DC018389", "Award Amount": 427625.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-18", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "PLACE-BASED MAPPING IN ELECTRIC-ACOUSTIC STIMULATION LISTENERS - ABSTRACT COCHLEAR IMPLANT (CI) RECIPIENTS WITH ACOUSTIC HEARING IN THE IMPLANTED EAR ARE FIT WITH A HEARING AID AND CI IN THE SAME EAR, A CONFIGURATION DESCRIBED AS ELECTRIC-ACOUSTIC STIMULATION (EAS). WHILE EAS SUPPORTS BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN A CI ALONE, THE BENEFIT VARIES WIDELY ACROSS INDIVIDUALS. ONE POSSIBLE SOURCE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IS VARIABILITY IN THE CI FREQUENCY-TO-PLACE MISMATCH, WHICH IS A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE ELECTRIC FILTER FREQUENCY ASSIGNED TO A PARTICULAR ELECTRODE AND THE NORMAL COCHLEAR PLACE FREQUENCY AT THE LOCATION OF THAT ELECTRODE. WHILE PRIOR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TONOTOPIC MISMATCH IMPACTS SPEECH PERCEPTION IN CI-ALONE USERS, THE IMPACT OF MISMATCH ON EAS PERFORMANCE IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. MISMATCH IN EAS OCCURS BECAUSE CURRENT DEFAULT MAPPING PROCEDURES USE THE PATIENT\u2019S UNAIDED HEARING THRESHOLDS IN THE IMPLANTED EAR TO DETERMINE THE LOWEST FREQUENCY FILTER ASSIGNED TO ELECTRIC STIMULATION AND DISTRIBUTES HIGHER-FREQUENCY INFORMATION LOGARITHMICALLY ACROSS THE REMAINING ELECTRODES IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR LOCATION WITHIN THE COCHLEA. MISMATCH IS PREVALENT IN EAS USERS DUE TO WIDE VARIABILITY IN ANGULAR INSERTION DEPTH (AID) ACROSS AND WITHIN ELECTRODE ARRAYS, AND VARIABILITY IN RESIDUAL HEARING. MISMATCH OCCURS IN TWO SCENARIOS: 1) APICAL ELECTRODES LIE BASAL TO THE ACOUSTIC CUT-OFF FREQUENCY AND DELIVER FREQUENCY INFORMATION THAT IS LOWER THAN THEIR ASSOCIATED PLACE FREQUENCY, OR 2) APICAL ELECTRODES LIE APICAL TO THE CUT-OFF FREQUENCY AND DELIVER FREQUENCY INFORMATION THAT IS HIGHER THAN THEIR ASSOCIATED PLACE FREQUENCY. IN BOTH SCENARIOS, PERFORMANCE WITH EAS IS LIKELY HINDERED BY THE MISMATCH BETWEEN PLACE OF STIMULATION AND NATURAL TONOTOPICITY OF THE COCHLEA. PERFORMANCE IN THE LATTER SCENARIO COULD BE FURTHER COMPROMISED BY PERIPHERAL ELECTRIC-ON-ACOUSTIC MASKING. HOWEVER, THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE AVOIDED IF A PATIENT\u2019S ACOUSTIC HEARING AND ELECTRODE ARRAY AID ARE INCORPORATED INTO EAS MAPPING USING A NOVEL PLACE-BASED MAPPING PROCEDURE. THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS EVALUATE A PLACE-BASED MAPPING PROCEDURE THAT USES POSTOPERATIVE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) TO CALCULATE THE AID OF INDIVIDUAL ELECTRODES TO DETERMINE THEIR COCHLEAR PLACE FREQUENCY. THE ELECTRIC FILTERS ARE ASSIGNED TO ALIGN WITH THE ASSOCIATED COCHLEAR PLACE FREQUENCY, RESULTING IN A PATIENT-SPECIFIC MAP THAT ELIMINATES FREQUENCY-TO-PLACE MISMATCH AND MINIMIZES PERIPHERAL MASKING. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A PLACE-BASED MAP WILL SUPPORT BETTER MONAURAL HEARING (E.G. SPEECH PERCEPTION) IN EAS USERS BY LIMITING THE NEED TO ACCLIMATE TO SPECTRALLY-SHIFTED ELECTRIC INFORMATION WHILE THE ACOUSTIC INFORMATION IS TRANSDUCED IN THE NATURAL PLACE. FURTHER, WE EXPECT THAT IT WILL SUPPORT BETTER BINAURAL HEARING (E.G. SPATIAL RELEASE FROM MASKING) BY PROVIDING AN INTERAURAL MATCH OF FREQUENCY INFORMATION BETWEEN EARS. BENEFITS OF A PLACE-BASED MAP OVER A DEFAULT MAP WILL LIKELY BE MOST APPARENT DURING THE INITIAL MONTHS OF EAS USE WHEN ACCLIMATIZATION TO MISMATCH IS OCCURRING IN THE DEFAULT CASE, AND MAY PERSIST LONGER-TERM FOR THOSE WITH THE GREATEST DEGREES OF MISMATCH.

ADVERSE DRUG- DRUG INTERACTIONS (DDIS) THAT POTENTIATE OTOTOXICITY COMPLICATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTI-DRUG REGIMENS, PARTICULARLY TO TREAT MULTIPLE CONCURRENT CONDITIONS. IN MOST CASES, DDIS ARE CURRENTLY DETECTED ONLY AFTER THE DRUGS ARE ON THE MARKET, SO EFFECTIVE PRECLINICAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ADVERSE INTERACTIONS WOULD FACILITATE SAFER CO-PRESCRIPTIONS. THE ASTRONOMICAL NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS RENDERS MEASURING ALL POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS INFEASIBLE, SO PREDICTING HOW OTOTOXIC DRUGS INTERACT FROM DATA OF INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS IS NECESSARY. WHILE THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF MECHANISMS UNDERLYING OTOTOXICITY OF SPECIFIC DRUG CLASSES HAS HELPED TO EXPLAIN CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS OF SPECIFIC ADVERSE OTOTOXICITY DDIS, AND AIDED RATIONAL DESIGN OF CANDIDATE OTOPROTECTIVE ADJUVANTS, THIS STRATEGY CANNOT ANTICIPATE ADVERSE OTOTOXICITY DDIS OR DEVELOP OTOPROTECTANTS FOR OTHER LESSER STUDIED DRUG CLASSES AND FIRST-IN-CLASS DRUGS UNDER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT.

WITH RECENT DISCOV- ERIES PERTAINING TO COCHLEAR SYNAPTOPATHY AND OUTER HAIR CELL (OHC) LOSS IN THE EXTENDED HIGH FREQUENCIES, IT IS CLEAR THAT MUCH OF THE EARLY NIHL REMAINS `HIDDEN' UNDER TRADITIONAL AUDIOLOGICAL SCRUTINY. WITHOUT EARLY DE- TECTION AND INTERVENTION, SUCH DAMAGE CAN PROGRESS INTO MORE SEVERE HEARING LOSS. THUS A CRITICAL WINDOW FOR THERAPEUTICS/LIFESTYLE CHANGES MAY GO UNUTILIZED. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO FEASIBLE TOOLS THAT CAN IDENTIFY EARLY HEARING DAMAGE. PRIOR STUDIES THAT TEST THE INTEGRITY OF THE AUDITORY AFFERENT PATHWAY HAVE NOT PRODUCED CONCLUSIVE RESULTS. HOWEVER, SHORT- AND LONG-TERM NOISE EXPOSURE-RELATED PERIPHERAL DAMAGE ARE CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN THE AUDITORY EFFERENT SYSTEM. SPECICALLY, HYPERACTIVITY IN THE MEDIAL OLIVOCOCHLEAR REEX (MOCR) AND THRESHOLD ELEVATION OF THE MIDDLE EAR MUSCLE REEX (MEMR) HAVE BEEN REPORTED. GIVEN THE PROTECTIVE ROLES OF THE MOCR AND THE MEMR THROUGH INHIBITION OF PERIPHERAL INPUTS, AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAL CHANGES WITH DAMAGE, WE ARGUE THAT A COMBINED ASSAY OF MOCR AND MEMR MAY SERVE AS A MARKER FOR EARLY HEARING DAMAGE IN HUMANS.  USING A NOVEL OTOACOUSTIC EMISSION (OAE)-BASED EFFERENT ASSAY, IN THE PROPOSED STUDIES WE AIM TO (1) EVAL- UATE LONG-TERM AGE-SPECIC CHANGES IN EFFERENT AND AFFERENT FUNCTION DUE TO NOISE EXPOSURE AND (2) EVALUATE SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN EFFERENT AND AFFERENT FUNCTION DUE TO NOISE EXPOSURE. WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE CONCURRENT WORKING OF THE TWO REEXES ACROSS A WIDE AGE RANGE (18-50 YEARS) AND NOISE EXPOSURE BY RECRUITING INDIVIDUALS FROM HIGH NOISE EXPOSURE (MUSICIANS, VETERANS, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, FARMER) AND LOW NOISE EXPOSURE OCCUPA- TIONS (STUDENTS, PROFESSORS). TO EVALUATE SHORT-TERM CHANGES DUE TO NOISE EXPOSURE, WE WILL TEST PARTICIPANTS BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR TYPICAL WORK DAY. FOR RELIABLE EXPOSURE STRATICATION, NOISE EXPOSURE WILL BE OBJECTIVELY QUANTIED USING 5-DAY SOUND DOSIMETRY. WE WILL ALSO USE THE MOST SENSITIVE AFFERENT MEASURES TO ALLOW COMPARI- SON WITH EFFERENT MEASURES. MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES WILL BE EMPLOYED TO ASCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE COCHLEAR, AFFERENT, AND EFFERENT FUNCTION FOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM NOISE EXPOSURES.  FINDINGS FROM PROJECT 1 WILL REVEAL IF THE COMBINED MOCR AND MEMR METRICS CAN DELINEATE NOISE EXPOSURE EFFECTS FROM AGING, AND HIGHLIGHT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG COCHLEAR, AFFERENT, AND EFFERENT MEASURES. FINDINGS FROM PROJECT 2 WILL REVEAL IF LONG-TERM NOISE EXPOSURE PREDICTS SHORT-TERM CHANGES FOLLOWING NOISE EXPOSURE AND VICE- VERSA. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CHANGES IN THE AUDITORY SYSTEM FOLLOWING NOISE EXPOSURE WILL AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF (1) AN OBJECTIVE RAPID SCREENING TEST OF THE AUDITORY EFFERENTS CAPABLE OF DETECTING NOISE EXPOSURE-RELATED HEARING DAMAGE AND (2) A STATISTICAL MODEL TO ENABLE PREDICTING IMPENDING DAMAGE BASED ON EFFERENT FUNCTION. TOGETHER, THESE TOOLS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO EARLY DETECTION AND PROMOTE HEARING CONSERVATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f044e52c-101e-349e-69e4-aaa93e72f7ab-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC018108_7529"}, {"internal_id": 97469660, "Award ID": "R21DC018107", "Award Amount": 508500.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-05-13", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "DEVELOPMENT OF A BEHAVIORAL RAT MODEL TO ASSESS PROTEOMIC AND METABOLOMIC ADAPTATIONS OF LARYNGEAL MUSCLES IN RESPONSE TO VOCAL EXERCISE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c07787b9-15d4-d1eb-4f0c-2e0b30320bfb-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21DC018107_7529"}, {"internal_id": 127715961, "Award ID": "R21DC018103", "Award Amount": 450000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-02-19", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "THE INFLUENCE OF CONTEXTUAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL EMOTIONAL PROCESSES ON SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL AND SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD STUTTERING - PROJECT SUMMARY STUTTERING IS A COMMON SPEECH DISORDER THAT AFFECTS OVER 3 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT BEGINS IN THE PRESCHOOL YEARS, DURING A TIME WHEN SPEECH, LANGUAGE AND EMOTIONAL REGULATION PROCESSES ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING. APPROXIMATELY 5% OF PRESCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN STUTTER, AND FOR AT LEAST 20% OF THEM, STUTTERING PERSISTS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIME. ALTHOUGH THE ETIOLOGY OF STUTTERING IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, THE PREVAILING VIEWPOINT IS THAT THE DISORDER RESULTS FROM A COMPLEX INTERACTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL, COGNITIVE-LINGUISTIC, SPEECH MOTOR, AND EMOTIONAL VARIABLES. IMPORTANTLY, DESPITE THE THEORETICAL PROPOSITION THAT EMOTIONAL PROCESSES (BOTH CONTEXTUAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL) CONTRIBUTE TO CHILDHOOD STUTTERING, THE SPECIFIC MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THESE ASSOCIATIONS ARE UNKNOWN. TO DATE, WHILE BOTH EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY AND MOTOR CONTROL DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN FOUND IN CHILDREN WHO STUTTER COMPARED TO TYPICALLY DEVELOPING CHILDREN, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE PROCESSES INTERACT. THE MAJOR MOTIVATION FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAP BY APPLYING WELL-ESTABLISHED METHODS OF STUDYING SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL, EMOTIONAL PROCESSES AND EMOTION-MOTOR INTERACTIONS IN AN INVESTIGATION OF PRESCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN WHO STUTTER AND THEIR FLUENT PEERS. THE PRESENT APPLICATION IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF SITUATIONAL STRESS (CONTEXTUAL FACTOR) ON CHILDREN\u2019S SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL AND SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING; AND (2) DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF THE TEMPERAMENTAL TRAIT OF BEHAVIORAL INHIBITION (CONSTITUTIONAL FACTOR) ON CHILDREN\u2019S SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL AND SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL\u2019S CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT INCREASES IN EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY, DRIVEN BY THE SITUATIONAL CONTEXT, THE CHILD\u2019S INHERENT WAY OF RESPONDING TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT, OR BY THEIR COMBINED INFLUENCE, INTERFERE WITH SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL AND SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING PROCESSES NECESSARY FOR THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF FLUENT SPEECH. THE PROPOSED STUDY IS INNOVATIVE IN THAT IT REPRESENTS THE FIRST PROJECT TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF CONTEXTUAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL EMOTIONAL PROCESSES ON SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL AND SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING IN PRESCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN WHO DO AND DO NOT STUTTER. THE PROPOSED STUDY IS THEORETICALLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE UNDERSTANDING HOW EMOTIONAL PROCESSES CONTRIBUTE TO SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL AND SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING IN PRESCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN WILL LEAD TO AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF STUTTERING ONSET AND DEVELOPMENT. FURTHER, THE ANTICIPATED RESULTS WILL INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF A \u201cREAL-TIME\u201d INFLUENCE OF EMOTIONAL PROCESSES ON SPEECH. THIS RESEARCH IS CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN ITS POTENTIAL TO INFORM ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT OF STUTTERING IN CHILDREN, AS FLUENCY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES INVOLVE LEARNING NOVEL SPEECH MOVEMENT PATTERNS (SUCH AS PROLONGING SPEECH) AND EXECUTING THEM WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF AUTOMATICITY IN AND OUTSIDE OF CLINIC. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE MISSION OF NIDCD BY ADVANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF EMOTIONAL PROCESSES IN STUTTERING DEVELOPMENT AND THUS INFORMING OUR ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT FOR

- COMPELLED BY CURIOSITY AND A DESIRE TO LEARN, CHILDREN NATURALLY EXPLORE. HANDS-ON OBJECT EXPLORATION IS IMPORTANT FOR BUILDING VOCABULARY AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW THE WORLD WORKS, ESPECIALLY DURING SHARED DISCOVERY WITH CAREGIVERS WHO OFTEN PROVIDE GUIDANCE. AMONG CHILDREN WHO ARE BORN DEAF, THE LARGE MAJORITY EXPERIENCE LONG-TERM LEARNING DELAYS BECAUSE OF EARLY LACK OF ACCESS TO AMBIENT LANGUAGE, EVEN WITH AUDIOLOGICAL INTERVENTION. SENSORIMOTOR EXPLORATORY PLAY AND PARENTAL LANGUAGE INPUT DURING PLAY MAY AMELIORATE THIS RISK. MOREOVER, CHILDREN WHO RELY ON VISUAL-MANUAL SIGNED LANGUAGES FOR COMMUNICATION MAY HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF EXPLORING FOR LEARNING, COMPARED TO CHILDREN WHO RELY ON SPEECH FOR COMMUNICATION. THE IMPACT OF DEAFNESS AND SIGNED LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE ON EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORS IS UNKNOWN. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE THE FIRST TO GENERATE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORS IMPACT LEARNING IN DEAF AND SIGNING CHILDREN. BUILDING ON OUR PAST WORK, THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO FILL GAPS IN THE LITERATURE BY USING EXPERIMENTAL AND OBSERVATIONAL METHODS TO UNCOVER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOTOR EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORS AND LEARNING OUTCOMES IN CHILDREN BORN INTO DIFFERENT SENSORY ENVIRONMENTS. WE CONTRAST 4 GROUPS: DEAF VS. HEARING CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS ARE SIGNING OR SPEAKING. EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORS IN 4-TO-8-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN ARE RECORDED DURING A VISIT TO THE STRONG MUSEUM OF PLAY. TO CAPTURE ECOLOGICAL VARIATION, CHILDREN WILL PARTICIPATE IN THREE SETTINGS: FREE EXPLORATION IN A MINIATURE SUPERMARKET PLAY AREA (AIM 1), COOPERATIVE EXHIBIT INTERACTION WITH A PARENT (AIM 2), AND STRUCTURED MANIPULATION OF A HANDS-ON EXHIBIT (AIM 3). IN ALL AIMS, QUALITY, DEPTH AND FREQUENCY OF EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORS ARE CHARACTERIZED AND CODED BY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH ASSISTANTS. IN AIM 2, PARENTAL GUIDANCE BEHAVIORS AND THE WAYS THEY SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN DURING EXPLORATION IN A MUSEUM SETTING WILL BE CODED AND CONTRASTED AS A FUNCTION OF PARENTAL HEARING STATUS AND THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE MODALITY OF PARENT-CHILD INTERACTION. IN AIM 3, WE DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHILD\u2019S EXPLORATION AND PARENT GUIDANCE ON A CHILD\u2019S LEARNING. WE PREDICT THAT DEAF SIGNING PARENTS HAVE UNIQUE INTUITIVE WAYS OF GUIDING THEIR CHILD\u2019S EXPLORATION, DEAF SIGNING CHILDREN HAVE UNIQUE EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORS, AND THEIR EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORS ARE ADAPTIVE, RESULTING IN BETTER LEARNING. THIS WORK WILL BE CONDUCTED BY AN INVESTIGATOR TEAM, FULLY FLUENT IN ASL, WHO OVERSEES FIVE DEAF/HARD-OF-HEARING UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, IN A CITY WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF DEAF INDIVIDUALS IN THE U.S. THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE SHARED METHODOLOGY TO STUDY CHILDREN IN ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT SETTINGS; IDENTIFICATION OF PARENTAL GUIDANCE BEHAVIORS IMPORTANT TO CHILDREN\u2019S LEARNING; AND ELUCIDATION OF ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS TO LEARNING.

HERE WE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH A SONGBIRD MODEL SYSTEM OF AGING AND TEST A PROMISING MECHANISM OF TARGETED EPIGENETIC MANIPULATION IN IMPROVING MEMORIES FOR AUDITORY COMMUNICATION SIGNALS. WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF EPIGENETIC MANIPULATION ON THE AGE-RELATED INCREASED INFLAMMATION AND DECREASED NEUROGENESIS IN THE NEURAL SUBSTRATE UNDERLYING AUDITORY PROCESSING OF VOCALIZATIONS. THE SONGBIRD MODEL HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CENTRAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICS OF NEUROGENESIS AND NEW NEURON INCORPORATION INTO TELENCEPHALIC CIRCUITS CORRESPONDING TO VARIED AND TRACTABLE BEHAVIORS AND COGNITIVE DOMAINS. DEVELOPMENTAL MODELS OF SONGBIRDS HAVE ALSO BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CRITICAL PERIODS IN SENSORY, MOTOR, AND SENSORIMOTOR LEARNING AND MEMORY. SURPRISINGLY, SONGBIRDS HAVE NOT BEEN USED MUCH AT THE END OF THE LIFESPAN TO STUDY BEHAVIORAL AND NEURAL SUBSTRATE CHANGES, AND INTERVENTIONS, DURING AGING AND SENESCENCE. IN THE FEW EXAMPLES OF SUCH USE, FINDINGS HAVE LED TO NEW AVENUES OF INVESTIGATION ADOPTED BY RESEARCHERS FOR STUDIES IN RODENT AGING. THUS, A SONGBIRD MODEL OF AGING PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISCOVERIES RELEVANT TO UNDERSTANDING HUMAN AGING THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN RODENT MODELS. THE USE OF EPIGENETIC TOOLS TO REGULATE GENE EXPRESSION IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF RESEARCH ON BRAIN AGING AND COGNITIVE DECLINE AND IS EMERGING AS A PROMISING TREATMENT IN A WIDE RANGE OF DISEASE MODELS OF NEURODEGENERATION. ONE MEANS OF EPIGENETIC REGULATION TARGETS HISTONE DEACETYLASES (HDACS), ENZYMES THAT SUPPRESS GENE TRANSCRIPTION BY CATALYZING THE REMOVAL OF HISTONE ACETYL GROUPS, RESULTING IN A CLOSED CHROMATIN STRUCTURE. HDAC INHIBITORS (HDIS) BLOCK THIS PROCESS, PROMOTING TRANSCRIPTION. HOWEVER, UNTIL RECENTLY, HDIS WERE LIMITED IN TRANSLATIONAL USE BECAUSE AVAILABLE HDIS TARGETED A BROAD RANGE OF HDACS, RESULTING IN WIDESPREAD SIDE EFFECTS. A NEW GENERATION OF HDAC-SPECIFIC HDIS IS LEADING THE WAY IN ESTABLISHING PROMISING TREATMENTS WITH LIMITED SIDE EFFECTS. HERE WE WILL DESCRIBE THE EFFECTS OF BLOCKING HDAC3 SPECIFICALLY ON GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES, NEURAL INFLAMMATION, NEUROGENESIS, AND PARAMETERS OF AUDITORY MEMORY FOR VOCALIZATIONS IN AGING MALE AND FEMALE ZEBRA FINCHES. THE RESULTS OF THIS WORK WILL ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF EPIGENETICS IN MODULATING INFLAMMATION, NEUROGENESIS, AND MEMORY WITH AN AIM TOWARD ESTABLISHING INTERVENTIONS FOR AGE-RELATED MEMORY LOSS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4d56551b-7301-dd7a-60f9-10e6e03e9f68-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R15DC020847_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160084377, "Award ID": "R15DC020836", "Award Amount": 477241.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-15", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "TRANSACTIONAL SUCCESS IN THE TEXTING EXCHANGES OF PEOPLE WITH APHASIA - ABSTRACT INDIVIDUALS WITH APHASIA EXPERIENCE REDUCED SOCIAL NETWORKS, A CONTRIBUTOR TO POOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE.

INDEED, PRELIMINARY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC APHASIA HAVE FEWER CONTACTS WITH WHOM THEY TEXT AND FEWER TEXT EXCHANGES THAN NEUROLOGICALLY HEALTHY ADULTS. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AN INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT ELECTRONIC MESSAGING IN INDIVIDUALS WITH APHASIA TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO A MODE OF COMMUNICATION THAT IS CRITICAL FOR MAINTAINING AND STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO: 1) VALIDATE A NOVEL MEASURE OF TRANSACTIONAL SUCCESS (INFORMATION EXCHANGE) IN TEXTING AND 2) IDENTIFY TEXTING BEHAVIORS THAT PERSONS WITH APHASIA AND THEIR PARTNERS ENGAGE IN THAT ENABLE AND DETRACT FROM TEXTING SUCCESS. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS TWO-FOLD. FIRST, IT IS CRITICAL TO HAVE A PSYCHOMETRICALLY STRONG MEASURE TO ASSESS TEXTING PERFORMANCE IN PERSONS WITH APHASIA. SECOND, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO IDENTIFY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCCESSFUL TRANSACTION TO DEVELOP AN INTERVENTION THAT FACILITATES TEXTING. TO ATTAIN THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE, THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BE PURSUED VIA A MIXED METHODS APPROACH. AIM 1 USES A SET OF STATISTICAL ANALYSES TO EVALUATE THE VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF A MEASURE OF TEXTING TRANSACTIONAL SUCCESS (TTS). THE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF A TTS RATING SCALE WILL BE EVALUATED USING PERFORMANCE DATA FROM 60 PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC APHASIA ON A THREE-TURN TEXTING SCRIPT COLLECTED UNDER A PREVIOUS CLINICAL TRIAL. AIM 2 APPLIES THE TTS SCALE TO AUTHENTIC TEXTING DATA COLLECTED FROM A PROSPECTIVE SAMPLE OF 24 INDIVIDUALS WITH APHASIA. EXTERNAL VALIDITY OF THE STANDARD TEXTING SCRIPT WILL BE ASSESSED BY EXAMINING THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS\u2019 SCORES ON THIS MEASURE AND SCORES YIELDED FROM PARTICIPANTS\u2019 AUTHENTIC TEXT EXCHANGES. AIM 3 IDENTIFIES TEXTING BEHAVIORS USED BY PEOPLE WITH APHASIA AND THEIR PARTNERS THAT ENABLE AND DISRUPT TRANSACTIONAL SUCCESS. CONVERSATION ANALYSIS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO TEXT EXCHANGES FROM THE SAME SAMPLE OF PARTICIPANTS FROM AIM 2 TO REVEAL REPAIR STRATEGIES AND VARIOUS MULTIMEDIA AND PARALINGUISTIC TOOLS (E.G. EMOJIS, IMAGES, CAPS, PUNCTUATION) THAT MAY ENHANCE TRANSACTIONAL SUCCESS. THESE REPAIR BEHAVIORS AND MULTIMEDIA/PARALINGUISTIC TOOLS ARE STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE TRAINED TO INCREASE TEXTING SUCCESS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES TEXTING, AN INCREASINGLY PERVASIVE MODE OF COMMUNICATION THAT IS UNDERSTUDIED IN APHASIA REHABILITATION. THIS RESEARCH APPLIES CONVERSATION ANALYSIS TO STUDY TEXT MESSAGING IN APHASIA, A NOVEL APPLICATION OF THIS METHODOLOGY. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE CONTRIBUTION OF A VALIDATED MEASURE OF TTS WILL OFFER A MEANS OF ASSESSING TEXTING PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATING TREATMENT OUTCOMES.

HYPERACUSIS IS A HEARING CONDITION CAUSING ONE\u2019S PERCEPTION OF SOUNDS TO BE ABNORMALLY LOUD, ANNOYING, FEARFUL, OR PAINFUL. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF HYPERACUSIS INVOLVES COUNSELING TO REDUCE NEGATIVE REACTIONS TO SOUNDS AND SOUND THERAPY TO IMPROVE LOUDNESS PERCEPTION. DESPITE THESE HELPFUL APPROACHES, MANAGEMENT OF HYPERACUSIS IS RESTRICTED TO HIGHLY SPECIALIZED PROFESSIONALS LOCATED AT LARGE CENTERS THAT ARE INACCESSIBLE BY MOST HYPERACUSIS PATIENTS. FURTHER, RESEARCH EVIDENCE FROM CONTROLLED TRIALS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TREATMENTS FOR HYPERACUSIS IS LACKING, INVOLVES ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS, AND IS LIMITED TO SPECIFIC APPROACHES, SUCH AS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND LOW-LEVEL BACKGROUND NOISE. IN RESPONSE TO THESE NEEDS, THIS RESEARCH TEAM DEVELOPED HYPERACUSIS ACTIVITIES TREATMENT (HAT), WHICH INCLUDES TWO COMPONENTS: COUNSELING AND SOUND THERAPY. ITS EFFECTIVENESS WAS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH DATA OBTAINED FROM CLINICAL FOCUS GROUPS AND SMALL-SCALE RESEARCH STUDIES. THERE IS ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL FOR HAT TO BE REMOTELY ADMINISTERED, THUS ADDRESSING THE ACCESS-TO-CARE ISSUE CURRENTLY FACING MANY RURAL AND LOW-INCOME AMERICANS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM HYPERACUSIS.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO DETERMINE THE HORMONAL AND ACOUSTIC SIGNALS THAT UNDERLIE THE PLASTICITY OF DOPAMINE INNERVATION AND ITS SYNTHESIS IN THE INNER EAR, WHICH, IN TURN, AFFECTS PRIMARY AUDITORY PROCESSING AND ENCODING OF SOCIAL VOCALIZATIONS. THE PLAINFIN MIDSHIPMAN FISH, PERHAPS THE MOST ROBUST MODEL FOR THIS KIND OF WORK HAS THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF UNCOVERING REGULATION AND FUNCTION OF DOPAMINERGIC INNER EAR EFFERENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL COMMUNICATION. IMPORTANTLY, THE NATURAL AND EXTRAORDINARY PLASTICITY OF THE PERIPHERAL AUDITORY SYSTEM (INCLUDING ITS DOPAMINERGIC EFFERENTS) IN FEMALE MIDSHIPMAN, APPEARS TO MIRROR CONDITIONS REFLECTIVE OF HUMAN HEARING LOSS AND ATTENTION. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM OF THE INNER EAR IS REGULATED BY CHANGES IN INTERNAL STATE VIA CIRCULATING HORMONES AND LOCAL SYNTHESIS OF DOPAMINE CAN BE MODULATED BY SOCIAL ACOUSTIC STIMULI. THIS HYPOTHESIS, STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY PRELIMINARY DATA, WILL BE TESTED BY THE FOLLOWING TWO SPECIFC AIMS: 1) MEASURE HORMONE-INDUCED CHANGES IN DOPAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION AND 2) CHARACTERIZE CHANGES IN DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS AND METABOLISM AFTER EXPOSURE TO SOCIAL ACOUSTIC SIGNALS.

THE CONCEPTS INCLUDE: TRAINING MULTIPLE VOICES TO MEET ALL THE CLIENTS\u2019 VOCAL NEEDS, DEFINING VOICE QUALITIES BY THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE VOICE PRODUCTION SYSTEM, GENERALIZING VOICE TARGETS INTO HIERARCHICAL SPEECH TASKS, AND USING \u201cNEW\u201d VS \u201cOTHER/OLD\u201d VOICE TO HELP THE CLIENT BECOME THEIR OWN CLINICIAN.

THIS VARIABILITY DEPENDS ON THE USERS\u2019 ABILITY TO PROCESS FREQUENCY AND TIME INFORMATION CRITICAL FOR SPEECH PERCEPTION. BY IDENTIFYING AND ENHANCING THIS ACOUSTIC INFORMATION, SPEECH PERCEPTION WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE. IN THIS AREA PROJECT, WE AIM TO ESTABLISH AND VERIFY A TAILORED IDENTIFICATION SCHEME FOR THE SPECTRAL AND TEMPORAL CUES RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSONANT RECOGNITION. OUR RECENT BIMODAL STUDY SHOWS THAT SOME FREQUENCY RANGES AND TIME SEGMENTS OF CONSONANTS ARE CRITICAL FOR CONSONANT ENHANCEMENT (CALLED \u201cTARGET FREQUENCY OR TIME RANGES\u201d) WHILE OTHER FREQUENCY AND TIME RANGES CAUSE CONSONANT CONFUSIONS (CALLED \u201cCONFLICTING FREQUENCY OR TIME RANGES\u201d).

THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT (CI) IS THE FIRST NEURAL PROSTHESIS IN WIDESPREAD CLINICAL APPLICATION FOR RESTORING SOUND SENSATION AND SPEECH UNDERSTANDING TO THE SEVERELY HARD-OF-HEARING POPULATION WHO HAVE DIFFICULTIES UNDERSTANDING SPEECH WITH ACOUSTIC HEARING AIDS. OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS, DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENTS' PERFORMANCE WITH THESE DEVICES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED AND HENCE A WIDER POPULATION OF PATIENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM COCHLEAR IMPLANTS. CURRENTLY THE AVERAGE SPEECH UNDERSTANDING SCORE FOR IMPLANTED POSTLINGUALLY DEAFENED ADULTS IS NEARLY 80% CORRECT FOR SENTENCE RECOGNITION IN QUIET AND 50% CORRECT IN LOW LEVELS OF BACKGROUND NOISE. CONGENITALLY DEAF CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE A CI PRIOR TO AGE 2 ARE ACHIEVING NEARLY NORMAL RATES OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT.

THERE IS A PAUCITY OF POPULATION RESEARCH ON THE SOCIAL, HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ON HEARING, AND THE EFFECTS OF HEARING LOSS ON PHYSICAL AS WELL AS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL HEALTH. A FULLER UNDERSTANDING OF THESE ISSUES MAY BE ADVANCED USING NEW METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO ADDRESS HEARING HEALTH IN THE POPULATION (FOR EXAMPLE, PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH USING CO-PRODUCTION RESEARCH METHODS INVOLVING COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS). POPULATION HEARING HEALTH CARE (POPHHC) IS A NETWORK OF RESEARCHERS, CLINICIANS, STUDENTS, AND LEADING ADVOCATES IN NON- GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE WITH HEARING LOSS. POPHHC AIMS TO INCREASE THE IMPACT OF HEARING HEALTH CARE RESEARCH ON GLOBAL HEARING HEALTH CARE IN ORDER TO PREVENT HEARING LOSS AND TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO LIVE WITH HEARING LOSS. SPECIFICALLY, POPHHC PROMOTES INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL POPULATION DATA USING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND DATA-SHARING INFRASTRUCTURES THAT ARE BECOMING MORE COMMON.

THESE THREE-DAY INTENSIVE CONFERENCES WILL BRING TOGETHER BASIC AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENTISTS, CLINICIANS, PATIENTS, AND HEALTH POLICYMAKERS TO PROMOTE THE PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH HEARING AND BALANCE DISORDERS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT CLINICAL OUTCOMES WILL BE IMPROVED IF THEY INCORPORATE A COLLABORATIVE, INTERPROFESSIONAL CLINICAL APPROACH SHAPED BY BOTH THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PATIENT. CONSISTENT WITH THE NIDCD'S 2017-2021 STRATEGIC PLAN, THESE CONFERENCES AIM TO MEET THE CRITICAL NEED FOR MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT AUDITORY AND VESTIBULAR DEFICITS APPROPRIATELY WITHIN A PATIENT-CENTERED CARE MODEL.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THE 2021 CONFERENCE ARE TO ENHANCE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MECHANISMS, DIAGNOSIS, AND CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF VESTIBULAR DYSFUNCTION. SPECIFIC TOPICS INCLUDE CELLULAR REGENERATION, AGING, HEAD TRAUMA, PSYCHOPHYSICAL TESTING, ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE GUIDED DIAGNOSIS, VIRTUAL REALITY-BASED REHABILITATION, AND VESTIBULAR IMPLANTATION. PANEL DISCUSSIONS WITH PATIENTS AND EXPERTS AND CURATED MATCHING OF MENTORS WITH STUDENTS PROVIDE VALUABLE COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES. A NOVEL ASPECT OF THE CONFERENCE SERIES IS THE INCLUSION OF STAKEHOLDERS, SUCH AS PATIENTS AND POLICYMAKERS, WITHIN THE CLINICAL TEACHING SESSIONS. AN INNOVATIVE ASPECT IS TO OPTIMIZE THE RELEVANCE OF THE CASE-STUDY FOCUSED PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING SESSIONS BY POLLING ATTENDEES REGARDING THEIR CHALLENGES IN CLINICAL RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE.

THE CORE OF STEREOCILIA CONSISTS OF A HIGHLY CROSSLINKED PARACRYSTALLINE ARRAY OF ACTIN FILAMENTS. WHILE CROSSLINKER PROTEINS ARE CONSTANTLY RENEWED, THE RENEWAL OF ACTIN IS LIMITED TO THE STEREOCILIA TIPS. WE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT THE STEREOCILIA ACTIN CORE EXHIBITS ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY (VELEZ-ORTEGA, ET AL., ELIFE 2017). WE SHOWED THAT THE BLOCKAGE OF MET CHANNELS OR THE BREAKAGE OF THE TIP LINKS THAT GATE THESE CHANNELS LEAD TO THE SELECTIVE SHORTENING OF TRANSDUCING STEREOCILIA (I.E. THE STEREOCILIA THAT HARBOR MET CHANNELS), WHILE THE NON-TRANSDUCING TALLEST ROW STEREOCILIA REMAIN UNAFFECTED. ONCE THE MET BLOCKAGE IS REMOVED OR THE TIP LINKS REGENERATE, THE STEREOCILIA REGROW. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA ALSO SHOW THAT THIS MET-DEPENDENT STEREOCILIA REMODELING CAN AFFECT THE RESTING TENSION WITHIN THE MET MACHINERY IN SECONDS. THUS, THIS PROCESS MAY DYNAMICALLY REGULATE THE SENSITIVITY OF HAIR CELLS TO SOUND-INDUCED VIBRATIONS AND, HENCE, THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR HEARING. YET, THE EXACT MECHANISMS OF MET-DEPENDENT STEREOCILIA REMODELING ARE STILL OBSCURE. IT IS UNKNOWN EVEN WHETHER THE ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY OF THE STEREOCILIA CYTOSKELETON IS LIMITED TO THE REGIONS OF ACTIVE ACTIN RENEWAL OR CAN EXPAND BEYOND THIS REGION INTO THE \u201cSTABLE\u201d PART OF THE STEREOCILIA SHAFT. HERE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE MET ACTIVITY REGULATES THE EXTENT OF THE STEREOCILIA CYTOSKELETON UNDERGOING ACTIVE ACTIN REMODELING. TO TEST THIS, AIM 1 WILL EVALUATE MET-DEPENDENT CHANGES IN ACTIN DYNAMICS WITHIN THE STEREOCILIA AND THE CUTICULAR PLATE, AN ACTIN-RICH STRUCTURE SUPPORTING THE STEREOCILIA BUNDLE. AIM 2 WILL EVALUATE MET-DRIVEN CHANGES IN THE ULTRASTRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF STEREOCILIA ACTIN WITH TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TOMOGRAPHY.

UNFORTUNATELY, THE LITERATURE ON SUBSTANCE-MISUSE-RELATED HL IS SPORADIC AND PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF CASE REPORTS DESCRIBING VARIOUS DEGREES OF EITHER TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT HL FROM ILLICIT DRUGS OR PRESCRIBED OPIOID MISUSE.

A FEW STUDIES INDICATE ALCOHOL MISUSE IMPAIRS BALANCE, AND OPIOIDS AND ALCOHOL DISRUPT PERIPHERAL AND CENTRAL VESTIBULAR FUNCTION. THE EXISTING STUDIES SUGGEST DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS ON THE INNER EAR BASED ON SUBSTANCE TYPE AND USE PATTERNS. THERE IS A CRITICAL LACK OF RIGOROUS RESEARCH USING OBJECTIVE MEASURES TO IDENTIFY THE PERIPHERAL AND CENTRAL EFFECTS OF SUDS ON HEARING AND VESTIBULAR FUNCTION.

HOWEVER, RESEARCH EVIDENCE TELLS US THAT FACTORS OTHER THAN THE SPEECH/LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO HOW A PERSON ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON THE CPIB. SOME FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE RESPONSES TO THE CPIB INCLUDE PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHRONIC STRESS, DEPRESSION, RESILIENCE, AND SELF-EFFICACY.

AUDITORY CORTICAL TISSUE WILL BE COLLECTED AT FOUR TIME POINTS (1, 3, 5 AND 10 D LATER) TO COVER THE ENTIRE CELL DEATH PROCESS. SECTIONS OF CORTICAL TISSUE WILL BE DOUBLE STAINED FOR PV AND CELL DEATH MARKERS (TUNEL STAINING FOR APOPTOSIS, AND ANTIBODY STAINING OF P-RIP3 FOR NECROPTOSIS). COLOCALIZATION OF TDTOMATO (DRIVEN BY A CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVE PROMOTER TO MARK ALL PV NEURONS EVEN IF THEY STOP EXPRESSING PV), PV AND THE CELL DEATH MARKERS WILL BE ANALYZED TO QUANTIFY PV NEURON DEATH VS. LACK OF PV. SPECIFIC AIM 2. CHARACTERIZE INPUT AND OUTPUT SYNAPSES OF THE SURVIVING CORTICAL PV NEURONS FOLLOWING NOISE TRAUMA. PV-CRE-TDTOMATO AND PV-CRE-CHR2-TDTOMATO MICE WILL UNDERGO THE NOISE TRAUMA PROCEDURE. TEN DAYS LATER, ACUTE AUDITORY CORTICAL SLICES WILL BE PREPARED. PATCH CLAMP RECORDING OF PV NEURONS IN PV-CRE- TDTOMATO SLICES WILL BE MADE, AND EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY SYNAPTIC INPUTS ON PV NEURONS WILL BE EXAMINED. IN ADDITION, OPTOGENETICALLY ACTIVATED PV NEURON OUTPUT ONTO LAYER2/3 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS WILL BE EXAMINED. THE INPUT-OUTPUT FUNCTION, SHORT-TERM PLASTICITY, AND SYNAPTIC DEPLETION/RECOVERY DYNAMICS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED. ALL RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED BETWEEN NOISE TRAUMA AND SHAM TRAUMA GROUPS. SPECIFIC AIM 3. INVESTIGATE THE ROLES OF TNFR1 AND TNFR2 IN NOISE-INDUCED PV NEURON LOSS AND SYNAPTIC DYSFUNCTION. WE WILL KNOCK DOWN TNFR1 OR TNFR2 IN CORTICAL PV NEURONS OF PV-CRE-TDTOMATO AND PV-CRE-CHR2-TDTOMATO MICE USING OUR CUSTOM-MADE VIRAL VECTORS FOR CRE-DEPENDENT EXPRESSION OF TNFR1 OR TNFR2 SHRNA.

OUR PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MOVIE-WATCHING RELATIVE TO TASK-BASED AND RESTING-STATE FMRI CAN PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE LANGUAGE MAPPING IN A GREATER NUMBER OF NEUROSURGICAL PATIENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LANGUAGE DEFICITS. COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL FMRI LANGUAGE MAPPING TASKS, MOVIE-WATCHING IS PREDICTED TO ENGAGE MORE COMPLETELY THE NEURAL NETWORKS SUPPORTING LANGUAGE IN REAL LIFE. MOVIE-WATCHING ALSO IMPROVES SUBJECT COMPLIANCE IN FMRI SCANNING.

THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF NETWORK NODES AND THE SMALL NUMBER OF CORTICAL AREAS WE CAN TARGET WITH PRESENT TMS DEVICES FORMS A CRITICAL BARRIER IN EXPLORING NETWORK-LEVEL CAUSAL INFERENCES IN THE HUMAN BRAIN. TO REMOVE THIS BARRIER, WE NEED TMS TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN PERTURB MULTIPLE CORTICAL LOCATIONS AT SPECIFIC PROCESSING STAGES. REMOVING THIS BARRIER WOULD OPEN ENTIRELY NEW AVENUES FOR GAINING INSIGHT INTO HOW COMPLEX COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS EMERGE FROM CORTICAL NETWORKS. FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEURAL NETWORKS UNDERLYING COGNITIVE OPERATIONS, TWO STEPS ARE NECESSARY. FIRST, NETWORK NODES ARE IDENTIFIED AS LOCATIONS WHERE THE STRENGTH OF THE TMS-INDUCED ELECTRIC FIELD AND RELEVANT BEHAVIORAL OR NEUROIMAGING-BASED VARIABLES MAXIMALLY CORRELATE. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED EFFICIENTLY USING THE UNPRECEDENTED ABILITY OF THE MULTICHANNEL TMS ARRAY TO GENERATE DIFFERENT CUSTOMIZED ELECTRIC FIELD PATTERNS IN RAPID SUCCESSION. NEXT, INFORMATION FLOW BETWEEN THE NETWORK NODES IS EXPLORED BY STIMULATING THE NODES IN RAPID TEMPORAL SUCCESSION.

THESE FINDINGS RAISE THREE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: 1) WHAT IS THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF PHENOTYPIC DIVERSITY BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL XIIMN POOLS? 2) WHAT ARE THE ANATOMIC AND IONIC MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE THIS PHENOTYPIC DIVERSITY? 3) DO STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES AMONG XIIMNS IN EACH POOL MAP TO UNIQUE GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES?

OUR INITIAL TARGETS ARE XIIMNS INNERVATING THE GENIOGLOSSUS, HYOGLOSSUS AND SUPERIOR LONGITUDINALIS MUSCLES, AS EACH MUSCLE HAS DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON TONGUE MOVEMENT.

SUBSTANCES WITH HIGH NUTRITIONAL VALUE ARE INGESTED, WHILE TOXINS AND HARMFUL SUBSTANCES ARE REJECTED. TO MAKE THIS DECISION, THE ANIMAL RELIES ON ITS SENSE OF TASTE TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD. MOST ANIMALS RESPOND TO SWEET AND BITTER TASTANTS WITH DIFFERENT STEREOTYPED BEHAVIORS: SWEET SUBSTANCES, OFTEN CALORIE RICH, ARE APPETITIVE AND ACCEPTED, WHILE BITTER COMPOUNDS, USUALLY HARMFUL, ARE REJECTED AND AVOIDED. ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF THE DECISION WHETHER TO INGEST OR REJECT POTENTIAL FOOD IS THE METABOLIC NEED OF THE ANIMAL THAT IS MANIFESTED BY THE BALANCE BETWEEN HUNGER AND SATIETY. THIS ASPECT OF THE INTERNAL STATE OF THE ANIMALS IS EVALUATED THROUGH AN INTRICATE BALANCE BETWEEN VARIOUS HORMONES AND NEUROMODULATORS, SOME SIGNAL HUNGER WHILE THE OTHERS SIGNAL SATIETY.

AIM 3 EVALUATES THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE TECHNOLOGY TO HEARING-IMPAIRED LISTENERS AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPATIAL SEGREGATION BOUNDARIES. THE PRESENT STUDY DRAWS FROM A LONG LINE OF RESEARCH ON AUDITORY SCENE ANALYSIS AND INTRODUCES A NOVEL APPROACH TO CORTICAL TRACKING OF SPEECH ENVELOPE IN COMPLEX SCENES. THIS PROJECT PUSHES THE FIELD FORWARD IN HOW WE MEASURE MECHANISMS OF STREAM SEGREGATION IN OLDER AND HEARING-IMPAIRED LISTENERS. THE RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL: (1) PRECISELY CHARACTERIZE INDIVIDUAL BINAURAL AND SPATIAL SEGREGATION BOUNDARIES; (2) PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF THE NEURAL CIRCUITRY AND PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY UNDERLYING THE INFLUENCE OF SPATIAL CUES ON STREAM SEGREGATION; (3) DISCOVER EVIDENCE FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BINAURAL SEGREGATION BOUNDARIES, INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, AND THE EFFECTS OF HEARING LOSS AND AGING; AND (4) INVESTIGATE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL SUPRATHRESHOLD HEARING ABILITIES AND SPECIFIC HEARING AID PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY. WHEREAS HEARING DEVICES CURRENTLY HAVE REMARKABLE BENEFITS TO SPECIFIC USERS, THE PRESENT RESEARCH SHOULD INSPIRE A NEW PUSH FOR INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS HEARING CHALLENGES OF AN AGING POPULATION.

TO UNDERSTAND HOW SENSORY CUES INFLUENCE BEHAVIORAL STATES AND HOW THE LINKS BETWEEN SENSORY CUES AND BEHAVIORAL STATES CAN FLEXIBLY CHANGE, IT WILL BE CRITICAL TO EXAMINE HOW NEURONS AT THE SENSORY PERIPHERY FEED INTO KEY NEURAL POPULATIONS THAT CONTROL BEHAVIORAL STATES. PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES LIKE STARVATION MAY INFLUENCE SENSORY CIRCUITS THEMSELVES, AS WELL AS THE INTERACTIONS OF THESE CIRCUITS WITH DOWNSTREAM NEURONS THAT CONTROL BEHAVIORAL STATES. THE C.

THE SECOND GAP IS IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF NEURAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING HOW SENTENCE PRODUCTION PLANNING NORMALLY UNFOLDS OVER TIME AND WHAT CRUCIAL SPATIOTEMPORAL ALTERATIONS GIVE RISE TO PSA-G VERSUS OTHER VARIANTS OF POST-STROKE APHASIA WITH PREDOMINANTLY LEXICO-SEMANTIC DEFICITS (PSA-LS).

FOOD NEOPHOBIA IS ESPECIALLY PREVALENT IN CHILDREN, AND THE REJECTION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF FOODS HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ACUTE HEALTH OF THE CHILD. MOREOVER, FOOD NEOPHOBIA IN CHILDHOOD HAS LONG- LASTING ADVERSE EFFECTS ON DIETARY CHOICES ASSOCIATED WITH EATING DISORDERS, POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND DISEASE.

LOSS OF READING ABILITY DUE TO STROKE, CALLED ALEXIA, LIKELY AFFECTS OVER A MILLION AMERICANS AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND CAUSES DIFFICULTY PERFORMING MANY DAILY LIFE FUNCTIONS. TO IMPROVE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF ALEXIA, WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE NEUROCOGNITIVE BASIS OF READING DEFICITS AFTER STROKE. HOWEVER, PRIOR SMALL-SCALE STUDIES USING BROAD DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES AND OLDER NEUROIMAGING METHODS HAVE YIELDED ONLY GENERAL LESION-BEHAVIOR ASSOCIATIONS IN ALEXIA. HERE, WE PROPOSE THE LARGEST STUDY TO DATE OF BOTH ALEXIA AND TYPICAL READING IN OLDER ADULTS, USING DETAILED MEASURES OF READING ABILITY AND THE MOST ADVANCED MULTIMODAL NEUROIMAGING METHODS AVAILABLE TO TEST A NEW NEUROCOGNITIVE MODEL.  READING RELIES ON BRAIN NETWORKS THAT EVOLVED FOR SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSES, BUT NEUROCOGNITIVE MODELS OF READING HAVE NOT YET INCORPORATED RECENT ADVANCES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE NETWORKS. WE PROPOSE A NEW MODEL OF READING INTEGRATED WITH SPEECH AND SEMANTICS (RISS) THAT PROVIDES A MORE SPECIFIC NEUROCOGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE FOR READING THAN PRIOR MODELS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT LESIONS OF SPECIFIC RISS NETWORK PROCESSORS AND CONNECTIONS ACCOUNT FOR SPECIFIC READING DEFICIT PATTERNS AFTER STROKE, AND THAT RESTORATION OF THE INJURED RISS PATHWAYS OR COMPENSATION IN UNINJURED PATHWAYS UNDERLIE ALEXIA RECOVERY.  ALTHOUGH BRAIN NETWORKS FOR READING HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY MAPPED IN TYPICAL AND ATYPICAL YOUNG POPULATIONS, STROKE TENDS TO OCCUR IN THE AGING BRAIN AND IN PEOPLE OF LOW EDUCATION AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (SES) WHO ARE TOO OFTEN LEFT OUT OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH. PATHOLOGICAL PATTERNS OF READING IN ALEXIA ARE ALSO OBSERVED TO A LESSER DEGREE IN TYPICAL READERS, AND AGE, EDUCATION AND SES ARE ALL KNOWN TO AFFECT READING ABILITIES. THEREFORE, ALEXIA CAN ONLY BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY EXAMINING HOW THESE FACTORS RELATE TO READING BEHAVIOR AND THE BRAIN IN TYPICAL OLDER ADULTS, AND REFERENCING READING DEFICITS TO THIS PERSONAL CONTEXT.  IN THE FIRST STUDY OF THIS PROJECT, WE WILL COLLECT AN EXTENSIVE BATTERY OF READING AND LANGUAGE TESTS ALONG WITH ADVANCED MULTIMODAL MRIS IN 100 OLDER ADULTS DEMOGRAPHICALLY MATCHED TO STROKE SURVIVORS. WE WILL TEST HYPOTHESES BASED ON RISS AND EXAMINE HOW AGE, EDUCATION, AND SES RELATE TO BOTH BEHAVIOR AND THE BRAIN.

COCHLEAR DEAFFERENTATION (I.E., LOSS OF INNER HAIR CELLS, SPIRAL GANGLION CELLS, OR COCHLEAR SYNAPSES), MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THESE PERCEPTUAL PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO METHOD FOR DIAGNOSING DEAFFERENTATION IN LIVING HUMANS. THIS PREVENTS US FROM DETERMINING THE PREVALENCE OF DEAFFERENTATION IN HUMANS, IDENTIFYING DEAFFERENTATION RISK FACTORS AND PERCEPTUAL CONSEQUENCES, OR TESTING POTENTIAL DRUG TREATMENTS. SEVERAL NON-INVASIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES ARE SENSITIVE TO LOSS OF COCHLEAR SYNAPSES (A FORM OF DEAFFERENTATION) IN ANIMAL MODELS, INCLUDING THE AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSE (ABR), THE ENVELOPE FOLLOWING RESPONSE (EFR), AND THE MIDDLE EAR MUSCLE REFLEX (MEMR). HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR HOW COCHLEAR GAIN LOSS (E.G., DUE TO OUTER HAIR CELL DAMAGE) IMPACTS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEAFFERENTATION AND THESE PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES, HINDERING TRANSLATION TO A DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR DEAFFERENTATION. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL THAT CAN ESTIMATE DEAFFERENTATION FROM NON-INVASIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS IN HUMANS WITH VARYING DEGREES OF COCHLEAR GAIN LOSS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT COCHLEAR GAIN LOSS CAN BE PREDICTED FROM DISTORTION PRODUCT OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS (DPOAES) AND DEAFFERENTATION CAN BE PREDICTED FROM A COMBINATION OF ABR, EFR, AND MEMR MEASUREMENTS. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY PURSUING FOUR SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) EXPAND A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF THE AUDITORY PERIPHERY (CMAP) TO PREDICT ABR, EFR, MEMR, AND DPOAE RESPONSES IN MICE AND HUMANS BASED ON BOTH COCHLEAR GAIN AND AFFERENT FUNCTION, 2) VALIDATE AND REFINE THE CMAP BY COLLECTING PHYSIOLOGICAL AND HISTOLOGICAL DATA FROM MOUSE, 3) PREDICT DEAFFERENTATION IN INDIVIDUAL HUMAN SUBJECTS FROM PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS BY FITTING THE CMAP USING BAYESIAN REGRESSION, AND 4) EVALUATE DEAFFERENTATION PREDICTIONS FOR THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH RISK FACTORS AND PREDICTED PERCEPTUAL CONSEQUENCES OF DEAFFERENTATION. THIS APPROACH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT EXTENDS PRIOR WORK TO ANIMAL AND HUMAN MODELS WITH BOTH COCHLEAR GAIN LOSS AND DEAFFERENTATION, USES COMPUTATIONAL MODELING TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN MODEL SYSTEMS, AND COMBINES MULTIPLE PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS TO PREDICT DEAFFERENTATION IN INDIVIDUAL HUMAN SUBJECTS.

GUIDED BY STRONG PRELIMINARY DATA THIS STUDY WILL PURSUE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) ESTABLISH THE CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN CISPLATIN-INDUCED LMO4 NITRATION AND OTOTOXICITY; (2) DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF CISPLATIN-INDUCED LMO4 NITRATION ON JAK/STAT SIGNALING; AND (3) DETERMINE THE OTOPROTECTIVE EFFICACY OF PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITION OF NITRATION. IN AIM 1, CISPLATIN-INDUCED APOPTOSIS WILL BE ANALYZED AFTER BLOCKING NITRATION OF LMO4 BY SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS AND INHIBITING PROTEASOMAL DEGRADATION OF NITRATED-LMO4 BY LACTACYSTIN. THE LINK BETWEEN LMO4 PROTEIN LEVELS AND CISPLATIN-INDUCED OTOTOXICITY WILL BE ASCERTAINED BY TESTING COCHLEAR APOPTOSIS/HEARING LOSS IN LMO4 KNOCKOUT AND OVEREXPRESSING MICE. IN AIM 2, CISPLATIN- INDUCED CHANGES IN PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS OF COCHLEAR LMO4 WILL BE ANALYZED USING A MASS SPECTROMETRY- BASED PROTEOMICS APPROACH WHILE JAK/STAT RELATED APOPTOTIC AND INFLAMMATORY SIGNALING WILL BE ANALYZED USING TARGETED GENE ARRAYS.

AN OPAQUE DIVIDER SEPARATES OBSERVER AND DEMONSTRATOR, SUCH THAT VISUAL CUES ARE ABSENT. OBSERVER GERBILS ARE THEN PERMITTED TO PRACTICE THE AUDITORY TASK, AND THE RATE OF LEARNING ASSESSED.

A PRIMARY CHALLENGE TO ESTABLISHING THE AFOREMENTIONED LINKS IS THAT AUTISM CANNOT ALWAYS BE RELIABLY DIAGNOSED IN THE EARLIEST STAGES OF LIFE (I.E., IN INFANCY AND TODDLERHOOD). A POTENTIAL SOLUTION IS TO PROSPECTIVELY FOLLOW INFANTS AND TODDLERS KNOWN TO BE AT HIGH LIKELIHOOD FOR A FUTURE DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM AND LANGUAGE DISORDER.

ONE KEY CHALLENGE IN SERVING BILINGUAL CHILDREN WITH DLD IS THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE(S) THEY SPEAK AND THE AVAILABILITY OF SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS (SLPS) WHO CAN PROVIDE SERVICES IN THOSE LANGUAGES. WHILE IT SEEMS SELF-EVIDENT THAT A MONOLINGUAL CHILD SHOULD BE TREATED IN THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE, CURRENTLY THERE IS NO GUIDANCE FOR SLPS AS TO THE LANGUAGE OF INTERVENTION FOR BILINGUAL CHILDREN (KOHNERT ET AL., 2005). HENCE, A CRITICAL QUESTION IS WHAT LANGUAGE(S) OF TREATMENT WILL BEST SERVE CHILDREN WITH DLD WITH DIFFERENT PROFICIENCY PROFILES IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH SPANISH AND ENGLISH. WE ASK FIRST WHETHER GAINS IN THE TREATED LANGUAGE(S) ARE INFLUENCED BY THE CHILD\u2019S PROFICIENCY IN EACH LANGUAGE (AIM 1). CROSS-LINGUISTIC TRANSFER HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN PRIMING STUDIES SUGGESTING THAT UNDERLYING SYNTAX REPRESENTATIONS ARE INTERCONNECTED. TRANSFER EFFECTS MAY MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR A CHILD TO IMPROVE IN BOTH LANGUAGES AS A RESULT OF TREATMENT IN ONE LANGUAGE, PROVIDED THAT THE CHILD HAS ADEQUATE LEVELS OF KNOWLEDGE TO CONNECT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN TREATMENT ACROSS BOTH LANGUAGES.

HOWEVER, UNDER THE CURRENT PARADIGM THESE MODELS MUST FIRST BE TRAINED ON SEPARATE NLP TASKS AND ONLY THEN USED TO MODEL THE BRAIN, CREATING A GUESS-AND-CHECK CYCLE THAT IS NOT GUARANTEED TO CONVERGE ON THE ACTUAL COMPUTATIONS THAT HUMANS PERFORM. HERE WE PROPOSE TO BREAK THIS CYCLE BY DIRECTLY TRAINING NEURAL NETWORK MODELS TO ESTIMATE THE FUNCTIONS THAT THE BRAIN USES TO COMBINE WORDS. TO BE ABLE TO OPTIMALLY PREDICT FMRI AND MEG RESPONSES, THESE MODELS WILL NEED TO CAPTURE THE COMPOSITION PRINCIPLES GOVERNING WHICH WORDS THE BRAIN ATTENDS TO, AND HOW INFORMATION IS COMBINED ACROSS WORDS. THESE MODELS WILL HELP UNCOVER SPECIFIC COMPUTATIONS UNDERLYING LANGUAGE PROCESSING IN THE BRAIN, ENABLE COMPUTATIONAL TESTING OF NEUROLINGUISTIC THEORIES, AND INSPIRE OR DIRECTLY IMPROVE MODELS USED IN NLP.  ACCOMPLISHING THESE GOALS, HOWEVER, WILL REQUIRE OVERCOMING ONE MAJOR OBSTACLE. TRAINING NEURAL NET- WORK LANGUAGE MODELS TYPICALLY REQUIRES ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE MORE DATA THAN EXISTING NEUROIMAGING DATASETS. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, ONE CENTRAL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO COLLECT A VERY LARGE FMRI AND MEG DATASET COMPRISING ROUGHLY ONE MILLION WORDS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE STIMULI. WE PLAN TO USE THE UNIQUE DATASET AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELING FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THREE SCIENTIFIC AIMS. AIM 1: CREATE BRAIN ACTIVITY PREDICTION BENCHMARKS TO FOSTER INTERACTION BETWEEN NEUROSCIENCE AND NLP. AIM 2: USE DATA-DRIVEN MODELS TO TEST EXISTING NEUROLINGUISTIC THEORIES & DEVELOP NEW ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPUTATIONS UNDERLYING WORD COMPOSITION IN THE BRAIN. AIM 3: LEVERAGE INFORMATION IN DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS TO HELP SOLVE COMPUTATIONALLY DEFINED LANGUAGE TASKS.

MOST CLINICIANS AND MANY PATIENTS ARE LEFT TO ASSUME THAT GENDER-AFFIRMING HORMONE THERAPY WITH TESTOSTERONE (T) IS THE ONLY PATH TOWARD VOICE CHANGE. THE CURRENT SPECULATION IS THAT T LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE VOCAL FOLDS, LEADING TO LOWER FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY (FO), AND THUS TO VOICE MASCULINIZATION. HOWEVER, THIS THEORY HAS NOT BEEN DIRECTLY ASSESSED, AND T IS LIKELY TO CAUSE ADDITIONAL STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE LARYNX AND VOCAL TRACT THAT MAY IMPACT BOTH SELF- AND LISTENER VOCAL-PERCEPTION OF GENDER (VPOG). IN SUMMARY, DESPITE A CRITICAL HEALTH NEED IN AN AT-RISK POPULATION, THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THIS COMMON VOICE TREATMENT FOR GD-AFAB INDIVIDUALS.

THIS IMPLICATES FURTHER PROCESSING BY HAIR CELLS (HCS) AND PRIMARY AFFERENT CONDUCTANCES, AND BY AFFERENT AND EFFERENT SYNAPSES. PROCESSING IS COMPLICATED BY THE PARALLEL MODES OF TRANSMISSION BETWEEN HCS AND AFFERENTS, AND THE CONVERGENCE OF MULTIPLE HCS ONTO SINGLE AFFERENTS. TYPE I HCS ARE ENVELOPED BY AN AFFERENT CALYX, CREATING A RESTRICTED VOLUME IN THE CLEFT BETWEEN THEM. TYPE II HCS SYNAPSE ONTO THE EXTERNAL FACE OF A CALYX AND/OR ONTO BOUTON ENDINGS VIA RELATIVELY SMALL CONTACT AREAS. THIS RESULTS IN THREE TYPES OF HC-TO-AFFERENT CONVERGENCE. IN THE SIMPLEST FORM, HCS CONVERGE ONTO AN AFFERENT SOLELY AT BOUTON ENDINGS. INCREASED COMPLEXITY IS FOUND AT CALYCES, INCLUDING BOTH SIMPLE CALYCES ENVELOPING ONE HC AND COMPLEX CALYCES ENCOMPASSING TWO OR MORE HCS. THE HIGHEST COMPLEXITY OCCURS AT DIMORPHIC ENDINGS THAT RECEIVE INPUT FROM BOTH HC TYPES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BOUTON AND BOTH INNER- AND OUTER-FACE CALYCEAL SYNAPSES. PRIOR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FOR CALYCEAL ENDINGS, RAPID EXCITATORY QUANTAL TRANSMISSION VIA GLUTAMATERGIC AMPA RECEPTORS MAY BE MODULATED BY K+, H+, AND CA2+ ACCUMULATION. DYNAMIC CHANGES IN CLEFT ION CONCENTRATIONS OCCUR IN RESPONSE TO HC OR AFFERENT DEPOLARIZATION. THESE IN TURN IMPACT RESPONSES IN BOTH THE TYPE I HCS AND THEIR AFFERENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN THE CONDUCTANCES AND EQUILIBRIUM POTENTIALS FACING THE CLEFT. AS A RESULT, PROPERTIES OF INNER-FACE CALYCEAL CONTACTS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE OF HC AND AFFERENT CONDUCTANCES BATHED IN THE BULK PERILYMPH. FOR THAT REASON, PRIOR SINGLE-ELECTRODE BIOPHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS ON HCS OR THEIR AFFERENTS IN SITU, OR ON ISOLATED CELLS, HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF HCS AND AFFERENTS RESULTING FROM RECIPROCAL INTERACTIONS CREATED BY THE UNIQUE VOLUME OF THE SYNAPTIC CLEFT COUPLING THE TWO.

MDDS, A CHRONIC ILLNESS THAT CAN LAST FOR MANY YEARS, IS MANIFESTED BY PERSISTENT FALSE SENSATIONS OF ROCKING/SWAYING OR GRAVITATIONAL PULL. MDDS IS DEBILITATING AS THESE SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS ARE TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIED BY OTHER PRESUMABLY SECONDARY PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE, AND AFFECTIVE PROBLEMS.

TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MDDS ARE LIMITED, AND IT WAS ONLY RECENTLY THAT A BREAKTHROUGH WAS MADE IN OUR CLINICAL LABORATORY WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL READAPTATION OF THE VESTIBULO-OCULAR REFLEX (VOR). THE PREMISE OF THIS TREATMENT IS THAT MDDS IS CAUSED BY MALADAPTATION OF A FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT OF THE VOR CALLED VELOCITY STORAGE, WHICH SHAPES SPATIAL ORIENTATION AND THE PERCEPTION OF SELF-MOTION. THE TREATMENT HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED BY MANEUVERING THE HEAD OF THE PATIENT SEATED INSIDE A CYLINDRICAL CHAMBER DURING A FULL-FIELD OPTOKINETIC STIMULATION (OKS). OUR CURRENT SUCCESS RATES IMMEDIATELY AFTER TREATMENT OF MT AND SO MDDS ARE 75% AND 50%, RESPECTIVELY.

WHILE A NUMBER OF FACTORS ARE THOUGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THESE LIMITATIONS, IT IS GENERALLY AGREED THAT COMPLEX AUDITORY SIGNALS, SUCH AS THOSE ARISING FROM SPEECH IN THE PRESENCE OF BACKGROUND NOISE, OR MUSIC, REQUIRE MORE INDEPENDENT SPECTRAL CHANNELS THAN ARE CREATED BY EXISTING, ELECTRODE-BASED CIS. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CHANNELS HAS PROVEN CHALLENGING HOWEVER, AS THE HIGHLY CONDUCTIVE SOLUTION SURROUNDING IMPLANTS (PERILYMPH) EXPANDS THE SPREAD OF ACTIVATION FROM EACH ELECTRODE SO THAT FIELDS FROM NEIGHBORING ELECTRODES OVERLAP AND CHANNELS ARE NO LONGER INDEPENDENT. THE SPREAD OF FIELDS IS WORSENED BECAUSE THE TARGETS OF STIMULATION (SPIRAL GANGLION NEURONS) ARE WITHIN ONE OF THE BONY CAVITIES OF THE COCHLEA AND THUS HIGHER STIMULUS LEVELS ARE REQUIRED FOR ACTIVATION WHICH LEAD TO INCREASED CURRENT SPREAD. MICROCOILS MAY BE AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO ELECTRODES BECAUSE THE PHYSICS GOVERNING THE SPREAD OF INDUCED FIELDS (MAXWELL\u2019S EQUATIONS) SUGGESTS NARROWER CONFINEMENT OF ACTIVATION. FURTHER, THE HIGH PERMEABILITY OF BIOLOGICAL TISSUES TO MAGNETIC FIELDS ALLOWS STIMULATION TO PASS READILY THROUGH THE BONY WALL, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR INCREASED STIMULATION LEVELS (AND THE RESULTING SPREAD OF ACTIVATION).

WITHOUT THIS KNOWLEDGE, THE PROMISE OF DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE AND OPTIMIZED TREATMENTS FOR SPEECH DISORDERS WILL LIKELY REMAIN LIMITED. THIS PROPOSAL\u2019S OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP BEHAVIORAL PROTOCOLS THAT SELECTIVELY TARGET AND IMPROVE SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING PROCESSES IN HEALTHY ADULTS. HERE, WE PROPOSE A RESEARCH PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AND OPTIMIZE A SET OF VISUALLY AUGMENTED TRAINING PROTOCOLS TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF TWO PROCESSES CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING: AUDITORY ERROR DETECTION AND AUDITORY-TO-MOTOR MAPPING. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT IMPROVING THESE PROCESSES THROUGH AUGMENTED TRAINING CAN IMPROVE SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING. WE FORMULATED THIS HYPOTHESIS BASED ON CURRENT THEORETICAL MODELS OF SPEECH, INCLUDING OUR RECENT COMPUTATIONAL MODEL. AIM 1 WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF ERROR-DETECTION TRAINING ON SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING. USING VISUAL FEEDBACK AND AUDITORY FEEDBACK PERTURBATION, WE WILL TRAIN SUBJECTS TO DETECT AND ESTIMATE AUDITORY ERRORS MORE ACCURATELY. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE WILL EVALUATE SUBJECTS\u2019 EXTENT OF SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING. AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AUDITORY-TO-MOTOR MAPPING TO SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING. USING VISUAL FEEDBACK, WE WILL TRAIN SUBJECTS TO LEARN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VARIOUS ARTICULATORY CONFIGURATIONS AND THEIR AUDITORY CONSEQUENCES. THEN, WE WILL EVALUATE SUBJECTS\u2019 EXTENT OF SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING. THIS PROJECT\u2019S RESULTS WILL HAVE A CRITICAL POSITIVE IMPACT BECAUSE (1) THEY WILL FORM A STRONG SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION THAT CAN INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE AND OPTIMIZED TREATMENTS FOR SPEECH DISORDERS, AND (2) THEY WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS BY ELUCIDATING PROCESSES OF SPEECH MOTOR LEARNING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AZ", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "18ebe923-151d-7095-dfea-7767365ba71d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01DC019905_7529"}, {"internal_id": 147111960, "Award ID": "R01DC019904", "Award Amount": 1021155.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-03-09", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "NEURAL PROCESSING OF SPEECH SIGNALS IN CHILDREN WHO STUTTER - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT DEVELOPMENTAL STUTTERING IS A DYNAMIC, MULTIFACTORIAL NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY UNINTENDED DISRUPTIONS IN FLUENT SPEECH PRODUCTION.

THE SPECTRO-TEMPORAL TUNING OF IC NEURONS ARISES FROM THE INTEGRATION OF A MULTITUDE OF ASCENDING AND DESCENDING INPUTS AND AN ELABORATED NETWORK OF EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY INTRINSIC SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS BETWEEN IC NEURONS. WHILE THE FUNCTION AND ORGANIZATION OF EXTERNAL INPUTS TO THE IC ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNDERSTOOD, CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORGANIZATION, PHYSIOLOGY, AND DEVELOPMENT OF SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS INTRINSIC TO THE IC IS LIMITED, HAMPERING INSIGHT INTO THEIR POTENTIAL ROLES IN IC FUNCTION. TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. IN AIM 1 WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE CENTRAL NUCLEUS OF THE IC (CNIC) CONTAINS TWO SEPARATE, FUNCTIONALLY DISTINCT, LOCAL NETWORKS ARISING FROM DISC-SHAPED AND STELLATE CELLS. WE FURTHER HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THESE NETWORKS OCCURS AFTER HEARING ONSET REQUIRES NORMAL PATTERNS OR LEVELS OF SOUND-EVOKED ACTIVITY. TO ADDRESS THESE HYPOTHESES, WE WILL USE LASER SCANNING PHOTOSTIMULATION WITH CAGED GLUTAMATE TO MAP THE LOCATION OF NEURONS IN THE CNIC THAT MONOSYNAPTICALLY CONNECT TO IDENTIFIED CNIC NEURONS IN SLICES FROM CONTROL MICE AND FROM MICE THAT WERE REARED IN PULSED WHITE NOISE OR HAVE EXPERIENCED TEMPORARY CONDUCTIVE HEARING LOSS. IN AIM 2 WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS ARE DISTINCT BETWEEN THE TWO INTRINSIC CNIC NETWORKS AND THAT THEIR MATURATION DEPENDS ON NORMAL AUDITORY EXPERIENCE. WE WILL ADDRESS THIS USING SIMULTANEOUS WHOLE-CELL RECORDINGS FROM IDENTIFIED NEURONS IN SLICES FROM CONTROL MICE AND MICE WITH A HISTORY OF ABNORMAL AUDITORY EXPERIENCE. IN AIM 3 WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ABNORMAL SOUND-EVOKED SINGLE UNIT RESPONSES IN THE CNIC OF MICE WITH A HISTORY OF ABNORMAL AUDITORY EXPERIENCE REFLECT ABNORMAL INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS. WE WILL ADDRESS THIS BY CHARACTERIZING SPECTRO-TEMPORAL RESPONSES PROPERTIES OF OPTOGENETICALLY IDENTIFIED GLUTAMATERGIC AND GABAERGIC CNIC NEURONS IN AWAKE CONTROL MICE AND MICE WITH A HISTORY OF ABNORMAL AUDITORY EXPERIENCE AND CORRELATE THE CHANGES OBSERVED IN IN-VIVO WITH CHANGES IN INTRINSIC NETWORKS CHARACTERIZED IN-VITRO. RESULTS FROM THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL PROVIDED NOVEL INSIGHT INTO THE ORGANIZATION, SYNAPTIC PHYSIOLOGY, AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTRINSIC CNIC CIRCUITS AND THEIR POSSIBLE ROLE IN IMPAIRED SOUND PROCESSING IN THE CNIC.

WE FURTHER FOUND THAT THE COCHLEAR DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER RATHER THAN HAIR CELL DEGENERATION IS A PRIMARY CAUSE FOR CONGENITAL DEAFNESS, WHEREAS LATE-ONSET HEARING LOSS IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTION OF OUTER HAIR CELL (OHC) ELECTROMOTILITY EVEN HAIR CELLS HAVE NO CONNEXIN EXPRESSION.

INDEED, HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS ARTICULATORY PERFORMANCE PATTERNS HAVE BEEN REPORTED ACROSS AND WITHIN DISEASE TYPES AND MOTIVATED US TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW, TAXONOMIC (DATA-DRIVEN) APPROACH TO DYSARTHRIA CLASSIFICATION BASED ON SPEECH KINEMATIC MEASURES. OUR PILOT WORK ON A COHORT OF 28 TALKERS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD), AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS), AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) REVEALED SIX DYSARTHRIA SUBGROUPS WITH UNIQUE ARTICULATORY IMPAIRMENT PROFILES ADDRESSING TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF VOCAL TRACT ADJUSTMENTS AS WELL AS LABIAL COUPLING. THREE DISEASE-DOMINANT SUBGROUPS AND WELL AS THREE MIXED-DISEASE SUBGROUPS WERE IDENTIFIED. THIS PROPOSED PROJECT SEEKS TO EXPAND UPON THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS. IN SPECIFIC AIM 1, WE WILL CLASSIFY THE ARTICULATORY PERFORMANCE PROFILES OF 160 TALKERS WITH VARYING UNDERLYING DISEASE TYPES [PD, ALS, MS, HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE (HD)]. TO ALLOW FOR A CLINICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE KINEMATIC FINDINGS, ARTICULATORY PERFORMANCE OF TALKERS WITH DYSARTHRIA WILL BE REFERENCED TO AGE- AND SEX-SPECIFIC CONTROL GROUPS. WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE WHICH KINEMATIC MEASURES DIFFERENTIATE TALKERS WITH DYSARTHRIA AND IF DISEASE-TYPE VARIES SYSTEMATICALLY ACROSS ARTICULATION- BASED DYSARTHRIA SUBGROUPS. TO ENSURE A RAPID TRANSLATION OF OUR KINEMATIC-BASED CLASSIFICATION APPROACH INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE WE WILL DETERMINE HOW PERCEPTUAL-BASED CLINICAL RATINGS OF ARTICULATORY PERFORMANCE MAP ONTO FINDINGS OF KINEMATIC MEASURES (SPECIFIC AIM 2).

A PRIMARY AIM OF TREATMENT IS IMPROVING SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY. CURRENT PEDIATRIC DYSARTHRIA INTERVENTIONS FOCUS ON CLEAR AND/OR LOUD SPEECH, PHONATION, SPEECH RATE, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE. WHILE SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INTELLIGIBILITY GAINS, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL VARIABILITY IN OUTCOMES. ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT INTELLIGIBILITY CAN BE MAXIMIZED FOR ALL CHILDREN.

HOWEVER, THESE MEASURES ARE NOT CLINICALLY ACCESSIBLE, NOR DO THEY TRANSLATE TO SPECIFIC TREATMENT TARGETS. GIVEN THE PRIMACY OF THE ARTICULATORY SYSTEM TO INTELLIGIBILITY AND DEVELOPMENTAL MALLEABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SPEECH IN CHILDREN, THERE IS A NEED FOR SENSITIVE METRICS TO QUANTIFY ARTICULATION USING CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL UNITS (I.E., SPEECH SOUNDS).

RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (TDCS) IS A PROMISING ADJUVANT APPROACH TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SLT. TDCS IS A NONINVASIVE, NON-PAINFUL, ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE BRAIN. IT IS BELIEVED THAT TDCS BOOSTS NEURAL PLASTICITY THAT UNDERLIES RECOVERY WITH SLT. A MAJORITY OF THE TDCS STUDIES OF APHASIA HAVE STIMULATED THE LEFT HEMISPHERE REGIONS. HOWEVER, LEFT HEMISPHERE LESIONS COMMON IN POST-STROKE APHASIA AFFECT THE ELECTRICAL FIELD IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS, POTENTIALLY PREVENTING STIMULATION FROM REACHING PERILESIONAL TISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIMAL RECOVERY. OUR WORK ADDRESSED THIS PROBLEM BY STIMULATING A NOVEL REGION, THE RIGHT CEREBELLUM. THE RIGHT CEREBELLUM IS CONNECTED TO THE LEFT HEMISPHERE AND INVOLVED IN A VARIETY OF COGNITIVE AND LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING NAMING, WHICH IS OFTEN IMPAIRED IN PEOPLE WITH APHASIA.

TOWARD THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF DEVELOPING TARGETED THERAPIES FOR THE PREVENTION AND/OR CORRECTION OF NOISE-INDUCED SYNAPTOPATHY, WE NOW SEEK TO DECIPHER THE PATHWAYS AND MECHANISMS LINKING NUCLEAR AMPK ACTIVITY IN INNER HAIR CELLS TO NIHL. BASED UPON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA, OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AMPK BECOMES ACTIVATED AND TRAPPED IN THE NUCLEUS OF INNER BUT NOT OUTER HAIR CELLS BY INTRANUCLEAR PHOSPHORYLATION AFTER NOISE EXPOSURE AND SUBSEQUENTLY REGULATES THE EXPRESSION OF DOWNSTREAM TARGETS THAT IMPACT THE NUMBER AND VOLUME OF PRESYNAPTIC RIBBONS. USING A COMBINATION OF GENETICS, PHYSIOLOGY, CELL BIOLOGY, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY, WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING THREE AIMS: THE IDENTIFICATION OF CELLULAR FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NIHL (AIM 1), THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC SHUTTLING OF AMPK (AIM 2), AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS IN THE AMPK PATHWAY LEADING TO SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NIHL (AIM 3).

BOTH SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND CHANGES IN SATIETY ARE CONNECTED WITH CHANGES IN THE FUNCTION OF THE OLFACTORY SYSTEM. PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES SUCH AS THESE ARE INTEGRATED IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS, WHERE DIFFERENT NEUROPEPTIDES ARE EXPRESSED BY SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF NEURONS. THESE PEPTIDES CAN REGULATE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP, OR PROMOTE FEEDING BEHAVIORS.

ONE PREVALENT HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPES IN ASD ARISE FROM ALTERED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN THE BRAIN. NEUROIMAGING STUDIES AND THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILE IN HUMAN ASD INDICATE THAT ALTERED MYELINATION AND WHITE MATTER INTEGRITY COULD BE A COMMON PATHOPHYSIOLOGY THAT IMPAIRS FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY.

OUR RECENT STUDIES PIONEERED A NEW CONCEPT IN HOW EXCITABILITY IN OLIGODENDROCYTES (OL), THE MYELINATING GLIAL CELL, CONTRIBUTES TO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NEURONS AND OLS.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO LINK THE LOSS OF OLIGODENDROGLIAL SCN2A TO ALTERATIONS IN MYELINATION AND NEURAL CONNECTIVITY IN THE AUDITORY SYSTEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW AUDITORY PROCESSING IS ALTERED IN SCN2A-MEDIATED DISORDERS AND ASD.

FAILURE OF THIS BILATERAL INTEGRATIVE PROCESS CAN ACCOUNT FOR MANY OF THE PERCEPTUAL AND BEHAVIORAL IMPAIRMENTS THAT ACCOMPANY AUDITORY DISORDERS, SUCH AS TINNITUS, PRESBYCUSIS AND CENTRAL AUDITORY PROCESSING DISORDERS, WHICH MOST OF THE POPULATION WILL EXPERIENCE OVER THE LIFESPAN.

OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION IS COMMON, AFFECTING AT LEAST 16 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. ALONE. OUR LAB AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION TO BE A CLINICAL MANIFESTATION OF A CLASS OF HUMAN GENETIC DISORDERS TERMED CILIOPATHIES. BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME (BBS) IS ONE SUCH DISORDER, IN WHICH THE ALTERED CILIA MORPHOLOGY OF OLFACTORY SENSORY NEURONS (OSNS) RENDERS THE CELLS UNRESPONSIVE TO ODORS. DESPITE THE IDENTIFICATION OF NUMEROUS GENES UNDERLYING CILIOPATHIES, CURATIVE THERAPIES (INCLUDING FOR OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTIONS) ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS. WE REPORTED THAT GENE REPLACEMENT TO RESTORE CILIA AND HENCE SENSORY INPUT IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIATED OSNS WAS SUFFICIENT TO RESCUE PERIPHERAL ODOR RESPONSES IN MOUSE MODELS OF A SUBSET OF CILIOPATHIES. HOWEVER, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CILIA BIOLOGY IN THE OLFACTORY SYSTEM AND ADVANCE POTENTIAL THERAPIES, WE MUST DEFINE THE CELLULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING OLFACTORY PENETRANCE OF CILIOPATHIES. WE MUST ALSO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE MECHANISMS ARE CONSERVED ACROSS DIFFERENT CILIOPATHIES AND MIGHT THUS BE AMENABLE TO THE SAME THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES. OSN CILIA COMPARTMENTALIZE ALL OF NECESSARY SIGNALING MACHINERY FOR ODOR DETECTION AND EVEN THOUGH OSN CILIA CAN BE LOST IN BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, THE CELLULAR MECHANISMS THAT MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THIS ESSENTIAL OSN CELL COMPARTMENT REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. CILIA IN OTHER CELLS AND ORGANISMS CONTAIN A MULTIPROTEIN COMPLEX AT ITS BASE, TERMED THE TRANSITION ZONE (TZ), THAT FUNCTIONS AS A REGULATORY GATE TO CONTROL THE UNIQUE PROTEIN AND LIPID COMPOSITION OF CILIA.

THIS PROPOSAL USES AN AVIAN MODEL TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BINAURAL DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE DEVELOPED THIS PREPARATION TO DETERMINE IF/WHEN THERE IS A DEVELOPMENTAL WINDOW IN WHICH INPUTS FROM EACH EAR ARE SYNCHRONIZED, IN ORDER FOR SENSITIVITY TO ITDS TO DEVELOP. SENSITIVITY TO BINAURAL SIGNALS FIRST APPEARS IN THE BRAINSTEM AND RELIES ON SUB-MILLISECOND PRECISION TO DETECT ITDS. HOW SUCH EXTREME PRECISION COMES ABOUT DURING DEVELOPMENT IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, AND THESE BIRDS PROVIDE A WELL UNDERSTOOD MODEL FOR MEASUREMENT OF PRECISELY TIMED BINAURAL SIGNALS. OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ITD CIRCUIT IS DETAILED ENOUGH TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT OF SOUND LOCALIZATION CIRCUITS. IN THE BROADER CONTEXT, UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS OF SOUND LOCALIZATION SHOULD REVEAL COMMON COMPUTATIONAL SOLUTIONS TO GUIDE ADVANCES IN HEARING AID AND COCHLEAR IMPLANT DESIGN. THE THREE OVERLAPPING AREAS TO BE INVESTIGATED IN THIS PROJECT ARE: 1. DETERMINE IF THE REPRESENTATION OF ITDS IS PLASTIC DURING DEVELOPMENT. DETECTION OF ITDS DEPENDS ON PRECISE CODING OF DELAY, WITH CURRENT RESEARCH ON HOW ITDS CHANGE WITH HEAD GROWTH. WE WILL USE A UNILATERAL CONDUCTIVE HEARING LOSS (CHL) MODEL, IN WHICH ONE EAR CANAL IS PLUGGED AROUND THE ONSET OF HEARING, TO INDUCE EXPERIENCE DEPENDENT PLASTICITY DURING THE PERIOD OF HEAD GROWTH. THESE EXPERIMENTS SHOULD ALLOW US TO DETERMINE IF MAPS OF ITD ARE MODIFIED BY EARLY EXPERIENCE. IN AIM 1.2 WE WILL FOCUS ON MYELIN PLASTICITY AS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR MODIFICATION. 2. ADDRESS MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE EMERGENCE OF TEMPORAL PRECISION. IF DELAYS CAN BE MODIFIED BY ALTERED EXPERIENCE, IT IS LIKELY THAT NORMAL ITD CODING ALSO SHOWS DEVELOPMENTAL REFINEMENT.

DEFENSIVE RESPONSES TO PREDATORY THREATS ARE MADE THROUGH A PRE-PROGRAMMED DEFENSIVE BRAIN CIRCUIT, WHICH HAS AN ABILITY TO INSTANTLY MAKE AN APPROPRIATE BEHAVIORAL DECISION UPON SENSING PREDATOR-DERIVED SENSORY STIMULI. IT IS WIDELY APPRECIATED THAT OLFACTION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR SENSORY MODALITIES THROUGH WHICH PREDATOR-DERIVED CHEMICAL CUES TRIGGER BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES IN PREY SPECIES. WHEN PREY ANIMALS DETECT IMMEDIATE DANGER IN PREDATOR CUES, THEY EXHIBIT ACUTE DEFENSE BEHAVIORS SUCH AS FREEZING OR FLIGHT. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN PREY ANIMALS DETECT ONLY POTENTIAL DANGER IN PREDATOR CUES, THEY EXHIBIT VIGILANCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT BEHAVIORS SUCH AS REPETITIVE STRETCHED SNIFFING. AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE IS WHETHER THESE DEFENSIVE DECISIONS FOR PREDATORY THREATS ARE MADE THROUGH DISTINCT NEURAL CIRCUITS OR BY A SHARED NEURAL POPULATION. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSED STUDY TO DISSECT DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORAL CIRCUITRIES ACTIVATED BY PREDATOR CUES THROUGH THE VOMERONASAL CHEMOSENSORY ORGAN (VNO), WHICH TRIGGER EITHER FREEZING OR RISK ASSESSMENT BEHAVIORS IN MICE.

THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BENEFIT FROM ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE MOTOR LEARNING: THE ABILITY TO ALTER MOTOR ACTIONS THROUGH PRACTICE. ONE TYPE OF MOTOR LEARNING, SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION, IS A PARTICULARLY PROMISING PATHWAY FOR ALTERNATIVE REHABILITATION. IN THIS PARADIGM, THE AUDITORY FEEDBACK PEOPLE RECEIVE WHILE SPEAKING IS EXTERNALLY PERTURBED, CAUSING THEM TO QUICKLY CHANGE THEIR SPEECH TO OPPOSE THESE PERTURBATIONS. BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO RAPIDLY INDUCE CHANGES IN SPEECH PRODUCTION WITHOUT CONSCIOUS CONTROL, SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION HOLDS UNIQUE PROMISE FOR REHABILITATION. HOWEVER, ITS POTENTIAL CLINICAL APPLICABILITY IS LIMITED BY POOR UNDERSTANDING OF KEY CLINICALLY-RELEVANT FEATURES.  FIRST, EXISTING SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION PARADIGMS DO NOT AFFECT SPEECH IN A WAY THAT FACILITATES COMMUNICATION. TO IMPROVE REHABILITATION OUTCOMES, SENSORIMOTOR LEARNING MUST TARGET CLINICALLY-RELEVANT SPEECH PARAMETERS SUCH AS INTELLIGIBILITY. WE ADDRESS THIS BARRIER THROUGH A NOVEL AUDITORY PERTURBATION THAT ARTIFICIALLY DECREASES THE PERCEIVED SPACE BETWEEN VOWELS, CAUSING SPEAKERS TO PRODUCE MORE VOWEL CONTRAST. CRITICALLY, REDUCED VOWEL CONTRAST IS A HALLMARK OF MOTOR SPEECH DISORDERS AND SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TO DECREASED INTELLIGIBILITY.

THE SHORT-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO STIMULATE LANGUAGE AND COMPREHENSION SKILLS IN GRADE 1 CHILDREN AT RISK FOR READING COMPREHENSION FAILURE BY TESTING THE EFFICACY OF A MODIFIED, SMALL-GROUP, VERSION OF THE LET'S KNOW! INTERVENTION, WHICH HAS SHOWN TO BE EFFICACIOUS AS A WHOLE- CLASS CURRICULUM. LET'S KNOW! SYSTEMATICALLY TARGETS LOWER- AND HIGHER-LEVEL LANGUAGE SKILLS TO IMPROVE BOTH LANGUAGE SKILLS AND LISTENING COMPREHENSION. DELIVERING SMALL-GROUP INSTRUCTION AFFORDS A TARGETED FOCUS ON THOSE CHILDREN WITH LOW LANGUAGE ABILITIES WHO ARE MOST AT RISK FOR POOR READING COMPREHENSION, MANY OF WHOM HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL LANGUAGE DISORDER (DLD). TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOAL, WE HAVE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: (A) DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF LET'S KNOW! AS A SCHOOL-BASED, SMALL-GROUP, LANGUAGE-FOCUSED COMPREHENSION INTERVENTION FOR PROMOTING THE LOWER-AND HIGHER-LEVEL LANGUAGE SKILLS OF GRADE 1 CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK FOR COMPREHENSION DIFFICULTIES DUE TO LOW LANGUAGE, (B) DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF LET'S KNOW! FOR PROMOTING THE COMPREHENSION SKILLS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK FOR COMPREHENSION DIFFICULTIES DUE TO LOW LANGUAGE, AND (C) DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH INTERVENTION EFFECTS ARE MODERATED BY DOSAGE, INITIAL LANGUAGE SKILL, DLD STATUS, WORD READING SKILL, NONVERBAL IQ, AND FAMILY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT INVOLVES A COLLABORATIVE AND MULTI-DISCIPLINARY PARTNERSHIP AMONG RESEARCHERS WHO STUDY BASIC DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES PERTAINING TO LANGUAGE AND READING ACQUISITION AS WELL AS SCHOOL-BASED PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT LANGUAGE AND READING SKILLS. WE USE A THREE-PHASE APPROACH TO ACCOMPLISH THIS CLINICAL TRIAL. PHASE 1 ENCOMPASSES KEY RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TO READY THE INTERVENTION FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN PHASE 2'S RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT). PHASE 2 COMPRISES A MULTISITE RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF LET'S KNOW! AS A SMALL- GROUP, LANGUAGE-FOCUSED COMPREHENSION INTERVENTION WHEN IMPLEMENTED AT CHILDREN'S RESPECTIVE SCHOOLS. THE RCT WILL MEET GUIDELINES FOR HIGH-QUALITY EFFICACY TRIALS IN EDUCATION AND PREVENTION SCIENCE. PHASE 3 WILL COMPRISE ANALYSES OF IMPACTS ON CHILDREN'S LANGUAGE AND COMPREHENSION SKILLS, IN BOTH THE SHORT- AND LONG- TERM, FROM GRADE 1 THROUGH GRADE 3 AS WELL AS MODERATION OF EFFECTS.

FIRST, THE PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON PREVENTION OF READING COMPREHENSION FAILURE, IN CHILDREN MOST VULNERABLE TO FAILURE, IN A CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT AREA OF READING INSTRUCTION THAT IS WEAK OR MISSING IN MOST US SCHOOLS \u2013 EXPLICIT AND SYSTEMATIC TEACHING OF LANGUAGE AND COMPREHENSION SKILLS. SECOND, THE STUDY BUILDS ON DECADES OF BASIC RESEARCH ON COMPREHENSION PROCESSES AND EVIDENCE-BASED PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICES TO TRANSLATE THESE INTO A PRACTICAL INTERVENTION THAT FITS SQUARELY WITHIN THE US EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. CONSIDERING THAT EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES ARE RARELY IMPLEMENTED DUE TO RESEARCH-TO-PRACTICE GAPS, BUILDING THE INTERVENTION TO FIT IN THE CURRENT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM INCREASES ITS CHANCE OF IMPLEMENTATION, IF FOUND TO BE EFFICACIOUS.

TO PREVENT AND REVERSE CENTRAL AUDITORY DYSFUNCTIONS FOLLOWING PERIPHERAL HEARING DEFICITS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW PLASTICITY IN THE AUDITORY BRAIN CREATES NEW CONNECTIONS BETWEEN RESTORED SOUND INPUT AND CENTRAL AUDITORY PROCESSING CENTERS.

IN PREPARATION OF THE STUDY WE HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) AND HAVE SUBMITTED A Q- SUBMISSION FOR A STUDY RISK ASSESSMENT FOR THE FIRST SET OF THE PROPOSED TESTS.

WE HAVE FOUND THAT MICE LACKING A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR CALLED FOXO3 BECOME SEVERELY AND PERMANENTLY DEAFENED AFTER A NOISE EXPOSURE THAT ONLY BRIEFLY AFFECTS THEIR WILD-TYPE LITTERMATES. FOXO3 HAS MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS IN OTHER CELL TYPES, INCLUDING OXIDATIVE STRESS REDUCTION, AUTOPHAGY, AND DIRECTLY INDUCING APOPTOSIS. A RECENT STUDY LINKED HUMAN GENETIC VARIATIONS IN FOXO3 TO A GREATER SUSCEPTIBILITY TO OCCUPATIONAL NIHL. HOWEVER, THE FOXO3 ALLELES ASSOCIATED WITH NIHL DRIVE INCREASED EXPRESSION OF FOXO3. THUS, THERE IS EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT FOXO3 IS IMPORTANT FOR HEARING PRESERVATION, BUT THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE THAT EXCESS FOXO3 DRIVES NIHL. IN THIS GRANT, WE SEEK TO ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP BY RESEARCHING THE MECHANISMS OF FOXO3 FUNCTION, USING TRANSLATOME SEQUENCING, CELL-SPECIFIC FOXO3 CONDITIONAL KNOCKOUTS (CKO), AND CRISPR MODIFICATIONS TO GENERATE MOUSE LINES THAT CAN BE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE HUMAN NIHL-LINKED FOXO3 ALLELE.  IN FOXO3-KNOCKOUT (KO) MICE, NOISE ELIMINATES HIGH-FREQUENCY OUTER HAIR CELLS (OHCS). WE SHOW THAT THIS OCCURS THROUGH A RAPID CELL DEATH PROGRAM CALLED PARTHANATOS, WHICH IS CASPASE-INDEPENDENT APOPTOSIS. PARTHANATOS INDICATES THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY NOISE DAMAGE, FOXO3-KO OHCS ARE PRIMED FOR DEATH. BULK RNA-SEQ DATA FROM CONTROL FOXO3-KO AND WILD-TYPE LITTERMATES SHOW NO EVIDENCE FOR CHANGES IN OXIDATIVE STRESS REDUCERS KNOWN TO BE REGULATED BY FOXO3. INSTEAD, WE SEE CHANGES IN ACTIN BINDING GENES EXPRESSED IN OHCS. IN AIM 1, WE PROPOSE TO VALIDATE THIS SCREEN AND IDENTIFY MARKERS OF OHC DISTRESS IN THE FOXO3-KO THROUGH TRANSLATOME SEQUENCING.

IN THE AUDITORY SYSTEM A DIRECT APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN ELUSIVE BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO MANIPULATE THE INPUT TO THE BRAIN FROM THE AUDITORY PERIPHERY WITHOUT EITHER COMPLETE ABLATION OF THE INNER EAR OR INDUCTION OF HEARING DYSFUNCTION. THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS WILL ESTABLISH FOR THE FIRST TIME, A MODEL OF REPATTERNED FREQUENCY REPRESENTATION IN THE CHICK INNER EAR BY UTILIZING A NEW GENETIC MANIPULATION IN EMBRYOS. THIS MANIPULATION TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE KNOWN GENETIC FACTORS THAT ESTABLISH THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EAR AT A VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE THAT PRECEDES THE AUDITORY NERVE INNERVATION OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. BY OVEREXPRESSING ONE OF THESE FACTORS, BONE MORPHOGENIC PROTEIN 7 (BMP7), INNER EARS DEVELOP ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY LOW FREQUENCY HAIR CELL PHENOTYPES. IN THE FIRST BRAIN STRUCTURE TO RECEIVE AUDITORY NERVE INPUT, THE COCHLEAR NUCLEUS, NEURONS EXPRESS A NUMBER OF WELL CHARACTERIZED BIOPHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATIONS FOR PROCESSING SOUND IN SPECIFIC FREQUENCIES. FREQUENCY SPECIFIC TUNING IS TOPOGRAPHICALLY MAPPED IN BOTH THE EAR AND AUDITORY BRAIN REGIONS, A FEATURE KNOWN AS 'TONOTOPY.' THUS, NEURAL SPECIALIZATION OCCURS ALONG AN ORDERLY TONOTOPIC MAP IN THE COCHLEAR NUCLEUS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT TONOTOPIC REFINEMENT OF SPECIALIZATIONS IN THE COCHLEAR NUCLEUS IS DEVELOPMENTALLY DETERMINED BY PATTERNED INPUT FROM THE INNER EAR, AND IS NOT INDEPENDENTLY INDUCED BY LOCAL CUES IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN. THIS HYPOTHESIS IS NOW TESTABLE USING ANIMALS WITH TONOTOPICALLY ALTERED INNER EARS.

HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BINAURAL CUES, SOUNDS FROM THE TWO EARS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED (BINAURAL INTEGRATION). BINAURAL INTEGRATION DOES NOT FULLY OCCUR FOR SOME POPULATIONS OF LISTENERS, SUCH AS COCHLEAR IMPLANT (CI) USERS. WHETHER, AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH, BINAURAL INTEGRATION OCCURS DEPENDS ON TWO ASPECTS OF THE ACOUSTIC SIGNAL. ONE ASPECT IS THE STATISTICAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE WAVEFORMS IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT EAR (INTERAURAL CORRELATION). THE SECOND IS THE SYMMETRY IN TERMS OF THE PLACE OF STIMULATION IN THE TWO EARS (PHYSICAL INTERAURAL SYMMETRY). OUR OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT INTERAURAL CORRELATION AND INTERAURAL SYMMETRY BOTH PLAY A ROLE IN BINAURAL INTEGRATION, WITH INTERAURAL CORRELATION ALSO DRIVING ADAPTATION, ALTERING THE FUNCTIONAL INTERAURAL ASYMMETRY TO COUNTER THE EFFECTS OF THE PHYSICAL INTERAURAL SYMMETRY.

ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE (NINDS), APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN THE U.S. SUFFER FROM APHASIA. THIS NUMBER IS ANTICIPATED TO RISE AS LIFE EXPECTANCY INCREASES AND LIFE-SAVING PROCEDURES IN ACUTE STROKE DECREASE MORTALITY RATES. ALTHOUGH SPEECH THERAPY CAN IMPROVE COMMUNICATION IN APHASIA, MOST PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE NEVER FULLY RECOVER AND ARE LEFT WITH LIFE-LONG DISABILITY AND SOME ONLY EXPERIENCE VERY MINIMAL RETURN OF COMMUNICATIVE FUNCTION. THEREFORE, A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH NEED IS TO IDENTIFY BIOMARKERS TO INFORM TARGETED TREATMENT AND IMPROVE ITS LONG-TERM OUTCOMES IN APHASIA. A MAJOR SHORTCOMING OF CURRENTLY EXISTING TREATMENT APPROACHES IS THAT THEY PRIMARILY FOCUS ON ENHANCING THE OUTCOME MEASURES ASSOCIATED VOCAL MOTOR PRODUCTION, WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT TARGETING DEFICITS IN SENSORY FEEDBACK AND/OR SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION MECHANISMS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE TREATMENT EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS.

DIRECT CURRENT (DC) COMPARED TO BIPHASIC CHARGE BALANCED PULSES NORMALLY USED BY NEURAL PROSTHESES TO INTERFACE TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, CAN MORE NATURALLY CONTROL NEURAL ACTIVITY. UNLIKE BIPHASIC CURRENT PULSES USED TO EXCITE NEURONS, DC CAN EXCITE, INHIBIT, AND MODULATE SENSITIVITY OF NEURONS.

KNOWLEDGE OF MODIFIABLE BRAIN TARGETS HAS NOT BEEN HARNESSED TO CATALYZE MEANINGFUL TREATMENT OUTCOMES. TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (TDCS) ALLOWS SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF BRAIN TARGET ENGAGEMENT. TDCS INVESTIGATIONS AIM TO RESTORE A LEFT HEMISPHERE BIAS FOR LANGUAGE PROCESSING. TDCS HAS STRONG CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL, BUT THE DIFFUSE CURRENT FLOW IT DELIVERS TO THE STROKE BRAIN AND UNCONTROLLED CORTICAL DOSAGE LIMITS INFERENTIAL PRECISION. ALTHOUGH TDCS COULD BE USED TO SHAPE HEMISPHERIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO LANGUAGE AND INVESTIGATE TARGET ENGAGEMENT, METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES SO FAR HAVE NOT EMPLOYED IT FOR THAT PURPOSE, PREVENTING VERTICAL PROGRESS IN APHASIA TREATMENT DEVELOPMENT. BOTH APHASIA AND TDCS RESEARCH ARE LACKING DATA ON MEANINGFUL LANGUAGE OUTCOMES AND TREATMENT-INDUCED BRAIN CHANGES. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR RIGOROUS INVESTIGATIONS OF TREATMENTS CAPABLE OF COAXING SPARED BRAIN AREAS INTO ADAPTIVE PARTICIPATION FOR FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS. FAILURE TO MEET THIS NEED MEANS THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITH APHASIA WILL HAVE LITTLE HOPE FOR EASING OF DISABILITY BURDEN. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO OPTIMIZE APHASIA RECOVERY WITH CLINICALLY TRANSLATABLE BRAIN-BASED APPROACHES. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE HOW TO INDUCE FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT AND ADAPTIVE CHANGES TO SPARED ELOQUENT LANGUAGE CORTEX. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGE OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC APHASIA WILL BE ENHANCED WHEN TREATMENT FOCUSES ON NORMALIZING LANGUAGE PROCESSING BIAS TO THE LEFT HEMISPHERE. THE RATIONALE IS THAT IDENTIFYING BEHAVIORAL AND ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENTS THAT ENGAGE BRAIN TARGETS WILL ALLOW OPTIMIZATION OF TREATMENT PARAMETERS AND FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL AND PERSONALIZED APPROACHES TO MOVE BEYOND THE STATUS QUO AND TOWARDS PRECISION NEUROREHABILITATION. GUIDED BY STRONG PRELIMINARY DATA, THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY PURSUING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DEMONSTRATE THE ENHANCING EFFECT OF TARGETED RIGHT HEMISPHERE MODULATION; AND 2) MEASURE NORMALIZATION OF BRAIN ACTIVITY FOLLOWING TREATMENT. UNDER THE FIRST AIM, LANGUAGE TREATMENT WILL BE PAIRED WITH ACTIVE OR SHAM HD-TDCS TO INHIBIT RIGHT INFERIOR FRONTAL RIGHT GYRUS (PARS TRIANGULARIS), AFTER WHICH GAINS IN NARRATIVE AND NAMING WILL BE MEASURED AND THE TWO GROUPS COMPARED. UNDER THE SECOND AIM, CHANGES IN EEG MEASURES OF BRAIN FUNCTION WILL BE CHARACTERIZED AND RELATED TO NARRATIVE AND NAMING OUTCOMES. THIS CONTRIBUTION WILL BE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED TO HAVE BROAD APPLICATION TO CLINICAL POPULATIONS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT-INDUCED ADAPTIVE BRAIN REORGANIZATION. OUR MAJOR INNOVATION FOR THIS PROJECT IS THE PAIRING OF A PROVEN BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT THAT WILL RECRUIT LANGUAGE NETWORKS WITH TARGETED \u201cHIGH-DEFINITION\u201d TDCS (HD-TDCS) TO FOCUS INHIBITION AND CONTROL CORTICAL DOSAGE TO THE FRONTAL RIGHT HEMISPHERE.

INFLAMMATION-TRIGGERED TASTE LOSS AND ITS RECOVERY - PROJECT SUMMARY TASTE LOSS CAN LEAD TO MALNUTRITION, WEIGHT LOSS, AND DEPRESSION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN TASTE ARE A SYMPTOM OF POOR HEALTH. THIS CYCLICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TASTE AND HEALTH HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING TASTE LOSS IN BOTH HEALTH AND DISEASE. RESEARCH ON TASTE LOSS WILL PROVIDE NEW APPROACHES IN THE PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE. IT IS WELL-DOCUMENTED THAT INFECTIONS AND AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY CHANGES IN CHEMOSENSORY PERCEPTION INCLUDING CHANGES IN TASTE. HOWEVER, CURRENTLY WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW TASTE BUD REGENERATION IS REGULATED, AND THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR TASTE LOSS. OUR RECENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT INFLAMMATION, CHARACTERIZED BY INDUCTION OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AND INFILTRATION AND ACTIVATION OF IMMUNE CELLS, CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO TASTE DYSFUNCTION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT INFLAMMATION, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE ACTION OF THE INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE INTERFERON- (IFN-), CONTRIBUTES TO TASTE LOSS BY INDUCING CELL DEATH AND INHIBITING TASTE BUD CELL RENEWAL, AND THAT RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION PROMOTES TASTE BUD REGENERATION. IFN- CAN BE PRODUCED BY VARIOUS TYPES OF IMMUNE AND NONIMMUNE CELLS IN RESPONSE TO INFECTIONS AND AUTOIMMUNITY. ITS LEVELS IN TASTE TISSUES ARE MARKEDLY INCREASED IN AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE MODEL WITH TASTE LOSS. YET, WHETHER IFN- DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTES TO TASTE LOSS HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF INFLAMMATION, ESPECIALLY IFN-, IN TASTE LOSS USING BOTH A TRANSGENIC APPROACH AND A CLINICALLY RELEVANT RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTION MODEL. WE WILL THEN USE THESE TASTE LOSS MODELS TO STUDY THE MECHANISMS OF TASTE BUD REGENERATION. THIS RESEARCH WILL TEST MECHANISTIC HYPOTHESES OF HOW INFLAMMATION AND INFECTION CAUSE TASTE LOSS, AND HOW TASTE RESPONSES RECOVER. TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH INVESTIGATING THE LINK BETWEEN INFLAMMATION, DISEASE, AND TASTE LOSS, A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF COVID-19 PATIENTS EXPERIENCE TASTE DYSFUNCTION. ALTHOUGH MOST CASES OF TASTE LOSS ARE TEMPORARY, INCLUDING TASTE LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH SARS-COV-2 INFECTION, LONG-TERM TASTE LOSS CAN OCCUR IN SOME PATIENTS. THUS, INSIGHTS FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL BE INFORMATIVE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND TASTE LOSS IN GENERAL, AS WELL AS TASTE LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place

AUDITORY CORTEX (ACX). HOW ACX DOES THIS CRITICALLY DEPENDS ON THE COORDINATED ACTIVITY OF POPULATIONS OF NEURONS: BOTH ACROSS THE CORTEX AND THROUGHOUT ITS MULTI-LAYERED STRUCTURE. THE PRIMARY AUDITORY CORTEX (A1) PLAYS A KEY ROLE FOR SOUND PERCEPTION SINCE IT REPRESENTS ONE OF THE FIRST CORTICAL PROCESSING STATIONS. RECENT RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THAT NEURAL ACTIVITY OF A1 NEURONS DEPEND NOT ONLY ON AUDITORY STIMULI THEMSELVES, BUT ARE INFLUENCED BY THE HISTORY OF SOUNDS, INTERNAL STATE, AND BEHAVIORAL CONTEXT OF THE ANIMAL. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SELECTIVITY OF INDIVIDUAL A1 NEURONS CAN RAPIDLY AND ADAPTIVELY BE RESHAPED WHEN AN ANIMAL IS ENGAGED IN A BEHAVIORAL TASK, OR WHEN LISTENING CONDITIONS BECOME MORE CHALLENGING. HOWEVER, BEHAVIORALLY RELEVANT INFORMATION IS ENCODED IN POPULATIONS OF NEURONS BUT TO DATE IT IS NOT UNDERSTOOD HOW BEHAVIORAL INFLUENCES SHAPE THE ACTIVITY ACROSS A1 NEURAL POPULATIONS, AND HOW THE RESULTING POPULATION ACTIVITY RELATES TO TASK PERFORMANCE. HERE WE DETERMINE HOW SOUNDS ARE DYNAMICALLY ENCODED IN DIVERSE CELL POPULATIONS DURING BEHAVIOR AND THE CHANGING NATURE OF THEIR CELLULAR INTERACTIONS WITHIN AND ACROSS A1 LAYERS.  BY USING IN VIVO 2-PHOTON IMAGING IN BEHAVING MICE WE WILL DETERMINE THE FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES TO COMPLEX STIMULI IN IDENTIFIED LARGE POPULATIONS OF A1 NEURONS, HOW THESE NEURONS INTERACT, RECONSTRUCT THE FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS PRESENT WITH A1, AND SHARED EXTERNAL INFLUENCES ON THESE A1 NETWORKS. WE THEN INVESTIGATE HOW A1 NETWORKS CHANGE THEIR RESPONSES AND FUNCTIONAL INTERACTIONS DURING AUDITORY BEHAVIORS OF VARYING TASK DIFFICULTY. THUS, WE DETERMINE HOW NETWORK CHANGES DEPEND ON THE IDENTIFY AND THE DIFFICULTY OF A TASK. TOGETHER, THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL REVEAL HOW A1 NETWORKS ARE DYNAMICALLY RECONFIGURED DEPENDING ON THE BEHAVIORAL NEEDS OF THE ANIMAL. OUR PRIOR WORK IDENTIFIED A REGION OF THE FRONTAL CORTEX, THE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX (OFC), AS A SOURCE OF INPUTS TO A1 THAT CAN CHANGE A1 RECEPTIVE FIELDS. WE THUS INVESTIGATE HOW OFC PROJECTIONS ARE ENGAGED DURING AUDITORY BEHAVIORS AND IF MANIPULATING OFC PROJECTIONS TO A1 WILL ALTER BEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE.  OUR WORK CONTRIBUTES TO THE MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ABILITY OF NORMAL-HEARING LISTENERS TO NAVIGATE COMPLEX OR NOISY ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENTS AND SHIFT THEIR ATTENTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT SOUND SOURCES.

RESTORATION OF COCHLEAR SYNAPSES FROM NOISE-INDUCED SYNAPTOPATHY IN MALE AND FEMALE MICE - MOST SPIRAL GANGLION NEURONS (SGNS) MAKE AFFERENT SYNAPSES ON THE AUDITORY SENSORY CELLS, THE INNER HAIR CELLS (IHCS), AND CONVEY AUDITORY INFORMATION TO THE BRAIN. NOISE DAMAGES COCHLEAR AFFERENT SYNAPSES EVEN AT SOUND LEVELS TOO LOW TO DESTROY HAIR CELLS. NOISE-INDUCED COCHLEAR \u201cSYNAPTOPATHY\u201d (NICS) IS DETECTABLE BY HISTOLOGICAL EXAMINATION AND COUNTING OF SYNAPSES AND IS ALSO EVIDENT, NONINVASIVELY, AS REDUCED AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSE (ABR) WAVE I AMPLITUDE. WHILE SYNAPTOPATHY DOES NOT DETECTABLY AFFECT AUDITORY THRESHOLDS, IT MAY CAUSE HEARING IMPAIRMENTS SUCH AS POORER SPEECH-IN-NOISE PERFORMANCE OR TINNITUS. IN THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATING MEANS TO PREVENT NICS, WE OBSERVED THAT FEMALE MICE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SUSCEPTIBLE THAN ARE MALES TO NICS. REMARKABLY, FEMALE SUSCEPTIBILITY VARIES WITH ESTROUS CYCLE PHASE, WITH LOWEST SUSCEPTIBILITY CORRELATED WITH THE ESTROUS PHASE AT WHICH PROGESTERONE (P4) LEVELS ARE HIGHEST (AND ESTROGEN LOWEST). IN VITRO EXPERIMENTS ADDITIONALLY SHOW THAT A HIGH LEVEL OF P4 PROMOTES RAPID REGENERATION OF SYNAPSES. THESE DATA SHOWING SEX DIFFERENCES IN SYNAPTOPATHY ARE THE FIRST TO SHOW THAT SUSCEPTIBILITY VARIES THROUGH THE ESTROUS CYCLE AND TO SHOW A PROTECTIVE ROLE FOR P4. TO FOLLOW UP, OUR FIRST AIM IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A HIGH LEVEL OF STEROID SEX HORMONE DOES REDUCE NICS. TO THAT END, WE WILL EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATE LEVELS OF P4 AND ESTROGEN IN MALE AND FEMALE MICE. WE HAVE FURTHER SHOWN THAT, NOT ONLY P4 BUT ALSO THE NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR CNTF AND AGENTS THAT ACTIVATE CYCLIC AMP (CAMP) SIGNALING PROMOTE SYNAPTIC REGENERATION. THE LATTER INCLUDE COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS ROLIPRAM, THAT CAN BE ADMINISTERED SYSTEMICALLY. P4, CNTF, AND ROLIPRAM REPRESENT EXCELLENT REAGENTS FOR INVESTIGATING THE ROLE IN VIVO OF CAMP IN SYNAPSE REGENERATION AND MAY ALSO BE CANDIDATE THERAPEUTICS FOR POST-NOISE SYNAPSE REGENERATION THERAPY. HOWEVER, COCHLEAR SYNAPSES MAY LOSE THEIR CAPACITY FOR REGENERATION WITH TIME AFTER DAMAGE AND THE TIMECOURSE MAY DIFFER AMONG THE DIFFERENT AGENTS PROMOTING REGENERATION. OUR SECOND AIM WILL DETERMINE HOW LONG AFTER NOISE THESE AGENTS, P4, CNTF, OR CAMP, MAY BE ADMINISTERED AND STILL PROMOTE REGENERATION. UNLIKE THE CASE FOR PEPTIDE NEUROTROPHIC FACTORS, THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR MECHANISM(S) BY WHICH PROGESTERONE OR CAMP PROMOTE SYNAPSE REGENERATION REMAIN OBSCURE. OUR THIRD AIM ASKS WHETHER THESE FACTORS FUNCTION VIA GENOMIC ACTIONS OR VIA CYTOPLASMIC TARGETS OR PLASMA MEMBRANE RECEPTORS \u2013 A NECESSARY PRELIMINARY STEP FOR FUTURE DETAILED MECHANISTIC STUDIES OF SIGNALING PATHWAYS AND POSSIBLE TRANSCRIPTOME CHANGES INVOLVED. FOR CAMP, THE QUESTION IS WHETHER CAMP- DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE ENTERS THE NUCLEUS OR REMAINS A CYTOPLASMIC SIGNAL, A QUESTION WE SUCCESSFULLY ANSWERED PREVIOUSLY WITH RESPECT TO SURVIVAL SIGNALING. FOR PROGESTERONE, OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT A NUCLEAR RECEPTOR IS NOT INVOLVED SO OUR FOCUS WILL BE ON PLASMA MEMBRANE PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA",

FAILURE TO QUICKLY SHIFT PERCEPTUAL RESOURCES BETWEEN AUDITORY AND OTHER MODALITIES HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO BE A CORE DEFICIT IN BOTH DYSLEXIA AND AUTISM. PRECISELY HOW THE BRAIN SHUTTLES INFORMATION BETWEEN SENSORY SYSTEMS IS NOT KNOWN, BUT RECENT WORK SUGGESTS THAT THE THALAMUS CONTAINS CIRCUITS THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RAPIDLY TRANSITION BETWEEN DIFFERENT SENSORY MODALITIES. SPECIFICALLY, THE THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS (TRN), A THIN SHELL OF GABAERGIC NEURONS SURROUNDING THE THALAMUS, MAY SERVE AS A LINK TO ALLOW COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE SENSORY THALAMUS, A PHENOMENON WE REFER TO AS THALAMIC \u201cCROSS- TALK.\u201d BASED ON RECENT DATA AND OUR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THALAMO-TRN- THALAMIC CIRCUITS PROVIDE CRITICAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THALAMIC NUCLEI AND THEREFORE PERMIT RAPID SWITCHING BETWEEN AUDITORY AND OTHER THALAMOCORTICAL PATHWAYS. WE PROPOSE TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS USING A NOVEL COMBINATION OF ANATOMICAL, CHEMOGENETIC, OPTICAL STIMULATION AND OPTICAL IMAGING APPROACHES IN THE MOUSE, USING BOTH SLICE AND IN VIVO APPROACHES. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL DETERMINE WHICH OF MULTIPLE POTENTIAL CIRCUIT PATHWAYS IS/ARE USED TO PERMIT AUDITORY, VISUAL AND AUDITORY THALAMIC NUCLEI TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. NEXT, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER AND HOW SUCH THALAMIC CROSS-TALK INFLUENCES SYNAPTIC RESPONSES AT THE LEVEL OF THE AUDITORY CORTEX. FINALLY, THE IMPACT OF THE TRN ON CROSS-MODAL PROCESSING WILL BE DIRECTLY EXAMINED BY OPTICALLY MODULATING THE TRN WHILE IMAGING CORTICAL RESPONSES TO COMBINED SENSORY STIMULATION IN AWAKE MICE. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST CIRCUIT-LEVEL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ROLE OF THE TRN IN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE AUDITORY THALAMUS AND OTHER THALAMIC REGIONS.

IN NO SMALL PART, THIS HAS BEEN DUE TO THE TRADITIONALLY LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC OR IMMIGRANT STATUS OF MULTILINGUAL INDIVIDUALS. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS A LACK OF FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND INTERACTION BETWEEN LANGUAGES IN THE BILINGUAL BRAIN. THIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE HAS APPALLING IMPLICATIONS FOR PLANNING BEHAVIORAL AND SURGICAL TREATMENTS FOR BILINGUAL INDIVIDUALS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS: IT IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR WHICH CORTICAL TISSUE NEEDS TO BE SPARED, AND HOW MUCH AND HOW OFTEN EACH LANGUAGE SHOULD BE TARGETED TO MAXIMIZE RECOVERED LANGUAGE FUNCTION AFTER BRAIN DAMAGE IN BILINGUAL INDIVIDUALS. THUS, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO OBTAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MULTILINGUAL INDIVIDUALS\u2019 LANGUAGES ARE ORGANIZED AND HOW THEY INTERACT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIES THAT MAXIMIZE POTENTIAL LANGUAGE RECOVERY AFTER BRAIN DAMAGE IN A DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THAT WILL BE THE MAJORITY OF THE US POPULATION BY 2040. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BY COMBINING THE STUDY OF APHASIC AND HEALTHY SPANISH- ENGLISH BILINGUAL INDIVIDUALS IN BEHAVIORAL AND FMRI TASKS TO CREATE A SYMBIOSIS WHERE THEORY AND PRAXIS MUTUALLY INFORM EACH OTHER.

ONE POWERFUL CONTRIBUTOR MAY BE A CONCOMITANT MOTOR SPEECH DISORDER, CHILDHOOD APRAXIA OF SPEECH (CAS). CAS IS AN IMPAIRMENT IN THE ABILITY TO PLAN AND SEQUENCE FOR SPEECH, WHICH RENDERS SPEECH INCONSISTENT AND IMPRECISE. BUT BECAUSE PRODUCING INTELLIGIBLE SPEECH IS A PREREQUISITE TO ACQUIRING SPOKEN LANGUAGE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW CAS MAY AFFECT SPEECH MOVEMENTS AND INTELLIGIBILITY IN MINIMALLY VERBAL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM, AND TO DEVELOP INTERVENTIONS THAT INCORPORATE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS CAS, WHEN PRESENT. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES THREE STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAS AND SPEECH IN MINIMALLY VERBAL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM AND CAS. FIRST, WE COMPARE A GROUP OF 11 MINIMALLY VERBAL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM WHO MEET CRITERIA FOR CAS TO A GROUP OF 11 WHO DO NOT MEET CRITERIA FOR CAS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT FACIAL MOVEMENT TRACKING, A NON-INVASIVE METHOD TO INVESTIGATE SPEECH MOTOR FUNCTION, WILL REVEAL THAT THE +CAS GROUP SHOW LOWER MOVEMENT CONSISTENCY AND PRECISION THAN THE \u2013CAS GROUP. NEXT, WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF CLINICAL SIGNS OF CAS TO SPEECH MOVEMENT PARAMETERS AND TO INTELLIGIBILITY. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MORE SEVERE CAS PREDICTS LOWER MOVEMENT CONSISTENCY AND PRECISION, AND LOWER INTELLIGIBILITY, IN AN ADDITIONAL GROUP OF 22 MINIMALLY VERBAL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM+CAS. FINALLY, WE USE THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS TO INFORM TREATMENT FOR A GROUP OF 20 MINIMALLY VERBAL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM+CAS. FIRST WE IDENTIFY THE SPEECH MOVEMENTS FOR EACH CHILD THAT ARE BOTH DISORDERED AND DEGRADE INTELLIGIBILITY,. THEN, WE CREATE A SET OF MONO- AND BISYLLABIC STIMULI INVOLVING THESE MOVEMENTS AND TRAIN PARTICIPANTS ON A SUBSET OF THEM IN A SERIES OF SINGLE-SUBJECT EXPERIMENTS. TREATMENT WILL INVOLVE PRINCIPLES OF MOTOR LEARNING (MASSED AND DISTRIBUTED PRACTICE) AND DYNAMIC CUEING, WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING CAS. BOTH PERCEPTUAL (INTELLIGIBILITY-BASED) AND OBJECTIVE (MOVEMENT-BASED) OUTCOME MEASURES WILL DEMONSTRATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS TARGETED TREATMENT IMPROVES SPEECH PRODUCTION IN THESE CHILDREN.

LISTENERS WITH HEARING LOSS, AND  4 ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH COCHLEAR IMPLANTS, SUFFER FROM A STRIKING DEFICIT IN PITCH PERCEPTION ABILITIES, AS  5 CURRENT SOUND PROCESSING STRATEGIES ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ROBUST PITCH CUES. DESPITE ADVANCES IN OUR  6 UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PITCH IS PERCEIVED, CODED, AND REPRESENTED IN OUR AUDITORY SYSTEM, THERE ARE  7 STILL SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN OUR BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PITCH, AND ESPECIALLY HARMONICITY, IS  8 REPRESENTED IN THE AUDITORY CORTEX. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEURAL TRANSFORMATIONS INVOLVED IN  9 PITCH PERCEPTION SHOULD HELP IN DESIGNING MORE EFFECTIVE NEURAL AND ACOUSTIC PROSTHESES. THE OVERALL 10 GOAL OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE NEURAL REPRESENTATION OF PITCH AND HARMONICITY AND 11 ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF TEMPORAL INTEGRATION IN PITCH PERCEPTION USING A COMBINATION OF BEHAVIORAL 12 (PSYCHOACOUSTICS), ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY (EEG), AND NEUROIMAGING TECHNIQUES (FMRI). IN THE MENTORED 13 K99 PHASE OF THIS PROJECT, THE CANDIDATE WILL CONDUCT RESEARCH ON BOTH OF THESE OVERARCHING THEMES. 14 FMRI WILL BE USED TO INVESTIGATE WHAT PROPERTIES OF HARMONIC COMPLEX TONES ARE REPRESENTED IN 15 ANTERIOR-LATERAL REGIONS OF AUDITORY CORTEX (AIM 1). USING CAREFULLY CONTROLLED STIMULI, THIS STUDY SHOULD 16 PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE FOR WHETHER HARMONIC TONES ELICIT A STRONGER RESPONSE THAN INHARMONIC TONES 17 IN AUDITORY CORTEX. THE CANDIDATE WILL ALSO CONDUCT A SERIES OF BEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENTS USING A NOVEL 18 STIMULUS THAT PRODUCES AN ILLUSORY VIRTUAL PITCH PERCEPT, TO PROVIDE EMPIRICAL DATA FOR QUANTIFYING THE 19 PARAMETERS GOVERNING TEMPORAL INTEGRATION IN THE PERCEPTION OF PITCH (AIM 2). THESE BEHAVIORAL 20 EXPERIMENTS WILL ADD CRUCIAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF PITCH PERCEPTION, WHICH ARE NOT 21 TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN CURRENT PITCH PERCEPTION MODELS. IN THE R00 PHASE OF THE PROJECT, THE CANDIDATE 22 WILL UTILIZE THE TECHNIQUES AND FINDINGS OF AIMS 1 AND 2 TO STUDY TWO IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF PITCH 23 PROCESSING AND PERCEPTION. A NOVEL MODIFICATION OF THE STIMULUS INVESTIGATED IN AIM 2 WILL BE UTILIZED IN 24 AN FMRI STUDY TO DIFFERENTIATE THE CORTICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF DIFFERENT PERCEPTUAL MODES OF LISTENING, 25 NAMELY SYNTHETIC AND ANALYTIC.

ALTHOUGH COCHLEAR RESPONSES TO TONES HAVE BEEN WELL STUDIED, RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE DYNAMIC (I.E., TIME-VARYING) ASPECTS OF THIS AMPLIFICATION PROCESS, SUCH AS ITS DELAYS AND ASSOCIATED TIME CONSTANTS. THESE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AMPLIFIER ARE ESPECIALLY RELEVANT FOR UNDERSTANDING DETAILS OF HOW DYNAMIC STIMULI, SUCH AS SPEECH, ARE ENCODED BY THE PERIPHERAL AUDITORY SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH COMBINES THE COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES OF INTRACOCHLEAR VIBROMETRY, OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS (OAES), AND THEORETICAL MODELING TO STUDY THE DYNAMICS OF NONLINEAR COCHLEAR AMPLIFICATION IN ANIMAL MODELS. THE K99 MENTORED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS AND ACTIVE MICROMECHANICS OF THE AMPLIFIER THROUGH IN VIVO VIBRATORY MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED AT TWO LOCATIONS WITHIN THE ORGAN OF CORTI, NEAR THE TOP AND BOTTOM SURFACES OF THE OUTER HAIR CELLS\u2014THE CELLULAR MOTORS OF THE COCHLEAR AMPLIFIER. PARALLEL MEASUREMENTS OF OAES WILL PROBE THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE AS NONINVASIVE ASSAYS OF THE DYNAMICAL FEATURES OF THE AMPLIFICATION PROCESS. MATHEMATICAL MODELS WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS OF THE COCHLEAR AMPLIFICATION DELAY AND ITS ROLE IN SHAPING OAES. THE R00 INDEPENDENT RESEARCH WILL EXTEND THE K99-PHASE FINDINGS BY FURTHER DISSECTING THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE DYNAMICAL FEATURES OF COCHLEAR AMPLIFICATION THROUGH STUDIES IN ANIMALS WITH WELL- DEFINED DAMAGE (ACOUSTIC TRAUMA) OR ABNORMALITY IN COCHLEAR STRUCTURES (TRANSGENIC MICE).  THESE RESULTS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A HIGH IMPACT BECAUSE THEY WILL BE FIRST TO REVEAL THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE DYNAMICS OF COCHLEAR AMPLIFICATION. BY RELATING THE OAE RESULTS TO THE VIBROMETRY DATA IN THE SAME ANIMALS, THE WORK WILL ESTABLISH THE UTILITY OF OAES AS NONINVASIVE ASSAYS OF THE DYNAMICS OF COCHLEAR PROCESSING. IN THE BROADER CONTEXT, THESE DATA WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO CONTRIBUTIONS OF PERIPHERAL PROCESSING TO TEMPORAL PHENOMENA OF HEARING THAT DEGRADE WITH SENSORY HEARING LOSS AND THUS WILL LAY THE NECESSARY GROUNDWORK FOR DEVELOPING INTERVENTION STRATEGIES AIMED AT RESTORING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN THE REALISTIC DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS.  THE K99 PHASE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL AID THE CANDIDATE\u2019S CAREER DEVELOPMENT BY INTRODUCING HER TO IN VIVO COCHLEAR VIBROMETRY AND BY EXPANDING HER LIMITED TRAINING IN MATHEMATICAL MODELING.

UBCS ARE POSITIONED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT TO AMPLIFY AND PROLONG SIGNALS AND LIKELY PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION, SOUND SOURCE LOCALIZATION AND CANCELLATION OF SELF-GENERATED SOUNDS. THE UBC HAS A CHARACTERISTIC LARGE DENDRITIC BRUSH THAT SLOWS THE DIFFUSION OF GLUTAMATE FROM THE SYN- APSE AND PROLONGS EXCITATORY SIGNALS. MULTISENSORY INPUT IS CARRIED TO UBCS BY MOSSY FIBERS. THE TRUSSELL LAB HAS FOUND THAT THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF UBCS- ONE RESPONDS TO GLUTAMATE RELEASED FROM MOSSY FIBERS WITH AN INCREASE IN FIRING (ON UBCS) AND ANOTHER THAT RESPONDS WITH A DECREASE IN FIRING (OFF UBCS). I HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT IN THE VESTIBULAR CEREBELLUM, ON UBCS RECEIVE DIRECT PRIMARY AFFERENT INPUT FROM VESTIBULAR GANGLION CELLS, WHEREAS OFF UBCS RECEIVE INDIRECT SECONDARY INPUT FROM VESTIBULAR NUCLEI. UBCS ARE ALSO PRE- SENT IN THE DORSAL COCHLEAR NUCLEUS (DCN), BUT THEIR MOSSY FIBER INPUTS ARE UNKNOWN.

TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, HE WILL SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON TWO CLASSES OF PROTEINS: (I) PROTEINS IDENTIFIED IN A YEAST TWO-HYBRID SCREEN THAT INTERACT WITH TMHS/LHFPL5, A COMPONENT OF THE MECHANOTRANSDUCTION COMPLEX OF HAIR CELLS; (II) CA2+ BINDING PROTEINS THAT ARE CANDIDATES TO REGULATE TRANSDUCTION. THE RESEARCH PLAN PROPOSES TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT LHFPL5 AND PROTEINS THAT BIND TO IT ARE PART OF A LARGER MECHANOTRANSDUCTION CHANNEL COMPLEX IN HAIR CELLS. SOME OF THE PROTEINS MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHANNEL PORE WHILE OTHERS MIGHT PLAY MODULATORY ROLES. CA2+ BINDINGS PROTEINS ARE PREDICTED TO BE CRITICAL FOR THE WELL-DOCUMENTED REGULATION OF THE TRANSDUCTION MACHINERY TO CA2+. THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL ANALYZE THE ROLE OF THESE PROTEINS IN MECHANOTRANSDUCTION IN BOTH COCHLEAR HAIR CELLS AND VESTIBULAR HAIR CELLS.

(LD) AND VOICE TREMOR (VT) ARE HYPERKINETIC NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR VOICE AND SPEECH PRODUCTION AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PATIENT\u2019S QUALITY OF LIFE, EXTENDING BEYOND SPEECH MOTOR ALTERATIONS AND OFTEN CAUSING OCCUPATIONAL DISABILITY AND LIFE-LONG SOCIAL ISOLATION. THE STANDARDS OF CLINICAL CARE OF LD AND VT ARE NOT ESTABLISHED; THAT IS, THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA REMAIN VAGUE, LEADING TO A HIGH RATE OF MISDIAGNOSIS, WHEREAS TREATMENT IS LARGELY LIMITED TO TEMPORARY SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT WITH BOTULINUM TOXIN INJECTIONS INTO THE AFFECTED LARYNGEAL MUSCLES. ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES OF SUBOPTIMAL CLINICAL CARE OF THESE PATIENTS IS THE LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DISTINCT CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND NEURAL PATHOPHYSIOLOGY. WE PROPOSE A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, CROSS-DISCIPLINARY CENTER RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT WILL FOCUS ON THE DELINEATION OF UNIQUE CLINICAL AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF LD AND VT IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE FUNDAMENTAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE ENHANCED CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF THESE DISORDERS, INCLUDING THEIR ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS AND DISORDER-SPECIFIC THERAPIES. THE CENTER RESEARCH GOALS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH COLLABORATIVE CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDIES AT MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO, AND UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, WHICH WILL INCLUDE THREE CENTER PROJECTS, A SCIENTIFIC CORE THAT INCORPORATES THE CLINICAL RESEARCH AND DATA SCIENCE COMPONENTS, AND AN ADMINISTRATIVE CORE THAT PROVIDES AN OVERALL ORGANIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE CENTER ACTIVITIES. THE OVERALL SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS CENTER WILL BE (1) CHARACTERIZATION OF CLINICAL PHENOTYPES OF LD AND VT; (2) UNDERSTANDING DISORDER-SPECIFIC NEURAL PATHOPHYSIOLOGY IN LD AND VT; (3) DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION IN LD AND VT, AND (4) MACHINE-LEARNING PLATFORMS FOR DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF LD AND VT. WE EXPECT THAT OUR CROSS-DISCIPLINARY AND COLLABORATIVE CENTER, ENCOMPASSING THE EXPERTISE IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY, SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY, NEUROLOGY, NEUROSURGERY, BRAIN AND LARYNX IMAGING, INVASIVE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY, AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE AND APPLYING COMPLEMENTARY MULTIMODAL METHODOLOGIES ACROSS THESE FIELDS, WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON DEVELOPING NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE LINKS BETWEEN SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF LD AND VT, WHICH WILL HELP DEFINE THE NEW STANDARDS OF ENHANCED CLINICAL CARE OF THESE DISORDERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of

ESTIMATED AT $13.5 BILLION ANNUALLY. VOCAL FATIGUE (VF) IS VIEWED AS AN ETIOLOGICAL AND/OR REACTIVE COMPONENT IN MOST COMMON VOICE DISORDERS AND IS ALSO AMONG THE MOST COMMON VOICE-RELATED COMPLAINTS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO RELY ON THEIR VOICES TO MAKE A LIVING (E.G., TEACHERS, SINGERS, ETC.). PREVIOUS DEFINITIONS OF VF HAVE VARIED WITH A RECENT ATTEMPT AT CONSENSUS DESCRIBING VF AS A MULTIFACETED CONCEPT THAT INVOLVES AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S SELF- PERCEIVED SYMPTOMS (E.G., INCREASED EFFORT AND DISCOMFORT) AND/OR A DETERIORATION IN VOCAL FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S ATTEMPT TO MEET HIS/HER VOCAL DEMANDS. PRIOR STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED HIGH SPEAKER-TO- SPEAKER VARIABILITY IN RECOVERY FROM VF, BUT THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH HIGH VARIABILITY ARE NOT DETERMINED. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS A PAUCITY OF OBJECTIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAUSES AND IMPACT ON PHONATORY MECHANISMS OF VF, LIMITING EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND CLINICALLY MANAGE THIS COMMON COMPLAINT. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE (1) TO USE A MULTI-MODAL MEASUREMENT APPROACH TO COMPREHENSIVELY, AND OBJECTIVELY, DESCRIBE THE PROGRESSIVE IMPACT OF VF ON VOCAL FUNCTION, (2) TO QUANTIFY THE UNDERLYING VOICING-RESTING BEHAVIORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROGRESSION OF VF AND ITS RECOVERY, AND (3) TO IDENTIFY THE VOCAL FUNCTION AND VOCAL BEHAVIOR PARAMETERS THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE OBSERVED HIGH VARIABILITY IN VF RECOVERY TRAJECTORIES. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE PURSUED USING A COMBINATION OF AN EXISTING AMBULATORY VOICE MONITORING DATASET AND NEW DATA. THE EXISTING DATASET INCLUDES AMBULATORY VOICE RECORDINGS FROM 87 VOCALLY TYPICAL INDIVIDUALS (FOR A TOTAL OF 889 DAYS) AND 123 PATIENTS WITH VOCAL HYPERFUNCTION (FOR A TOTAL OF 763 DAYS).

A PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE SUBSET OF EBS ARE THOSE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL LANGUAGE DISORDER (DLD), WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY LOW LANGUAGE SKILLS DESPITE OTHERWISE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT AND OCCURS IN ABOUT 7% OF CHILDREN. GIVEN THE SCARCITY OF BILINGUAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, CAREGIVER-DELIVERED LANGUAGE INTERVENTIONS ARE A PRACTICAL AND PROMISING APPROACH TO PREVENTING AND TREATING DLD IN THE HOME LANGUAGE. YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SPECIFIC CAREGIVER BEHAVIORS THAT SUSTAIN HOME LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT IN EBS WITH OR AT-RISK FOR DLD IN PRESCHOOL (AGE 3-5), A PERIOD WHEN OVERALL EXPOSURE TO ENGLISH INCREASES.

OLFACTORY NAVIGATION DRIVES ANIMAL BEHAVIORS RANGING FROM THOSE CRITICAL FOR MANKIND\u2019S SURVIVAL, SUCH AS CROP POLLINATION, TO THOSE THAT ARE FANTASTICALLY DESTRUCTIVE, SUCH AS THE LOCATION OF HUMAN HOSTS BY VECTORS OF DISEASE. OLFACTORY NAVIGATION IS ALSO AN IDEAL PARADIGM FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW NEURAL SYSTEMS CONVERT COMPLEX SENSORY STIMULI INTO SEQUENCES OF ACTIONS COMPRISING A GOAL-DIRECTED TASK. TO NAVIGATE ODOR PLUMES, ANIMALS MUST INTEGRATE POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING INFORMATION STREAMS FROM MULTIPLE SENSORY INPUTS, SUCH AS MECHANOSENSORY INFORMATION FROM WIND MOTION, AS WELL AS THE TIMING AND LOCATION OF ODOR SIGNALS. I WILL FOCUS ON AN INFORMATION STREAM NOT YET INVESTIGATED IN OLFACTION: THE DIRECTION OF MOTION OF TRAVELING ODOR FILAMENTS. THE DIRECTION OF ODOR MOTION MAY CONTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE ODOR SOURCE, WHICH CAN REINFORCE INFORMATION FROM LOCAL WIND CUES. THIS PROJECT WILL COMBINE SOPHISTICATED BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS, GENETIC SILENCING, CALCIUM IMAGING, AND THEORETICAL MODELING IN A MODEL SYSTEM, THE FRUIT FLY DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER, TO CHARACTERIZE HOW ODOR MOTION IS DETECTED AND USED IN NATURAL PLUME NAVIGATION. TARGETED NEURAL MANIPULATIONS ARE ENABLED BY THE WEALTH OF GENETIC TOOLS AVAILABLE IN DROSOPHILA SYSTEM \u2013 IN PARTICULAR THE RECENT IDENTIFICATION OF NEURON TYPES IN (AND DEVELOPMENT OF GENETIC DRIVERS FOR) HIGHER-ORDER OLFACTORY PROCESSING CENTERS. IN THE MENTORED (K99) PORTION OF THIS GRANT, I WILL USE BEHAVIORAL RECORDINGS AND OPTOGENETIC STIMULATION TO CHARACTERIZE ODOR DIRECTION SENSING IN FRUIT FLIES, AND HOW IT INTEGRATES WITH WIND SENSING. IN THE LATTER PORTION OF THE K99, CARRYING OVER INTO THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE R00, I WILL USE TARGETED GENETIC MANIPULATIONS AND CALCIUM IMAGING TO IDENTIFY THE NEURONS AND BRAIN REGIONS INVOLVED IN ODOR DIRECTION SENSING, AND TO CHARACTERIZE HOW ODOR DIRECTION IS ENCODED IN THE ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF 2ND- AND 3RD-ORDER OLFACTORY CIRCUIT NEURONS. THIS PORTION OF THE PROJECT IS UNIQUELY POSSIBLE IN THE DROSOPHILA SYSTEM, WHOSE WELL-MAPPED CONNECTOME ALLOWS CAUSAL PERTURBATIONS OF THE INFORMATION FLOW THROUGH THE OLFACTORY CIRCUIT HIERARCHY. IN THE LATTER PORTION OF THE R00, I WILL COMBINE THEORETICAL MODELS WITH BEHAVIORAL RECORDINGS TO QUANTIFY HOW INFORMATION FROM ODOR DIRECTION SENSING CAN BE OPTIMALLY EXPLOITED IN NAVIGATING NATURALISTIC ODOR PLUMES.

UNDERSTANDING THE NEURAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT GOVERN THE PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OF COMMUNICATION SOUNDS IS PARAMOUNT TO ADVANCE THE FIELDS OF AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. STUDIES INVESTIGATING SPEECH AND SOUND PROCESSING IN HUMANS HAVE MOSTLY IMPLEMENTED NON-INVASIVE METHODS, LEAVING A GAP IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT UNDERLYING NEURAL MECHANISMS. MY PROJECT BRIDGES THIS GAP BY EXPLOITING SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF ECHOLOCATING BATS, MAMMALS THAT PRODUCE AND PROCESS A RICH REPERTOIRE OF ACOUSTIC SIGNALS, TO INVESTIGATE THE CIRCUITS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCRIMINATION OF COMPLEX SOUNDS THAT CARRY DIFFERENT MEANINGS. BATS ARE SOCIAL MAMMALS WITH WELL-DEVELOPED AUDIO-VOCAL SYSTEMS AND PRODUCE ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATIONS FOR NAVIGATION AND SOCIAL COMMUNICATION, PROVIDING A DISTINCT OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE PATHWAYS, MOLECULES AND BRAIN REGIONS, WHICH ENABLE COMPLEX SOUND PROCESSING. AIM 1 COMBINES BEHAVIOR AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGY TO INVESTIGATE THE SPECIFIC ACOUSTIC FEATURES OF COMMUNICATION CALLS THAT ARE KEY TO EVOKE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES AND THE NEURAL SYSTEMS INVOLVED IN SOUND DISCRIMINATION. AIM 2 COMBINES PSYCHOPHYSICAL, NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL, AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INACTIVATION METHODS TO STUDY THE MIDBRAIN-AMYGDALA CIRCUIT'S ROLE IN MEDIATING DISCRIMINATION OF SOUNDS THAT SHOW OVERLAP IN SPECTRO-TEMPORAL FEATURES BUT CARRY DIFFERENT SEMANTIC CONTENT. AIM 3 INVESTIGATES CIRCUIT PHENOMENA IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT BY COMBINING NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS AND TARGETED PHARMACOLOGICAL INACTIVATION IN FREELY INTERACTING BATS. THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS OF THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM IS THAT SOCIAL- EMOTIONAL PROCESSING OF AUDITORY STIMULI THROUGH A MIDBRAIN-AMYGDALA CIRCUIT MEDIATES THE DISCRIMINATION OF SOUNDS THAT CARRY DIFFERENT MEANING. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PROJECT RESIDES IN THE EXTRAORDINARY SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITIES TO BRIDGE STUDIES OF AUDITORY BEHAVIORS, SINGLE NEURON RECORDINGS, CIRCUIT DISSECTION AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELING IN A MAMMALIAN MODEL. THIS WORK WILL CONTRIBUTE KEY NEW KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL SOUND PROCESSING MECHANISMS IN MAMMALS THAT COULD INFORM A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN AUDITORY COMMUNICATION DISORDERS.

ALTHOUGH APHASIA SYMPTOMS ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE AND RECOVERY IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, MUCH RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT LESION SIZE AND LOCATION ARE MAJOR DRIVERS OF APHASIA SYMPTOMS AND RECOVERY. HOWEVER, THIS PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS ONLY CONSIDERED DIRECT ANATOMICAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE LESION. THIS IS A CRITICAL LIMITATION BECAUSE STROKE LESIONS ALSO CAUSE INDIRECT EFFECTS ON THE FUNCTION OF BRAIN STRUCTURES DISTANT FROM THE LESION. THROUGHOUT THIS APPLICATION, I REFER TO THIS AS \u201cREMOTE DYSFUNCTION.\u201d ALTHOUGH INITIALLY THOUGHT TO RESOLVE QUICKLY AFTER THE STROKE, REMOTE DYSFUNCTION IS NOW KNOWN TO PERSIST THROUGHOUT RECOVERY AND INDEPENDENTLY CONTRIBUTE TO OUTCOMES. STUDIES OF APHASIA RECOVERY HAVE FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE IDEA OF RECOVERY THROUGH REORGANIZATION, WHEREBY BEHAVIORAL IMPROVEMENT OCCURS THROUGH PLASTIC REORGANIZATION OF BRAIN NETWORKS. THESE STUDIES HAVE ESCHEWED THE OLDER IDEA THAT RECOVERY OCCURS THROUGH PARTIAL RESOLUTION OF REMOTE DYSFUNCTION (RRD) CAUSED BY LESIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW RRD CONTRIBUTES TO APHASIA RECOVERY. THE APPLICANT HAS DEVELOPED A NEW MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH CALLED FUNCTIONAL ANOMALY MAPPING (FAM) THAT USES RESTING BOLD FUNCTIONAL MRI SIGNAL TO MAP REMOTE DYSFUNCTION THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN IN INDIVIDUAL STROKE SURVIVORS. FAM MAPS HAVE MUCH BETTER TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY THAN CURRENT MEASURES, LIKE TASK- RELATED FMRI ACTIVITY AND RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER FEATURES THAT MAKE IT PROMISING AS A CLINICALLY USEFUL TOOL. THE APPLICANT HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THAT REMOTE DYSFUNCTION MEASURED WITH FAM RELATES TO BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC APHASIA. DURING THE MENTORED PHASE OF THIS AWARD, THE APPLICANT WILL OPTIMIZE THE FAM APPROACH AND TEST COMPETING HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS GENERATING THE REMOTE DYSFUNCTION MEASURED IN CHRONIC APHASIA. DURING THE INDEPENDENT PHASE, THE APPLICANT PROPOSES A LONGITUDINAL STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTRIBUTION OF RRD TO APHASIA RECOVERY. THE APPLICANT PROPOSES A COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PLAN TO EXPAND HIS KNOWLEDGE IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF STROKE RECOVERY AND NEUROPLASTICITY BEYOND APHASIA, MACHINE LEARNING, BIOMARKER DEVELOPMENT, AND ADVANCED NEUROIMAGING ANALYSIS.

VESTIBULAR HAIR CELL DEGENERATION CAUSES BALANCE DYSFUNCTION MANIFESTED AS DIZZINESS AND VERTIGO. IN MICE, A LIMITED DEGREE OF SPONTANEOUS REGENERATION OCCURS IN THE UTRICLE, A VESTIBULAR ORGAN DETECTING LINEAR ACCELERATION. MOREOVER, ADDITION OF THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ATOH1 ROBUST ENHANCES REGENERATION OF HAIR CELLS IN THE MOUSE UTRICLE, BUT REGENERATED HAIR CELLS MATURE ONLY PARTIALLY RELATIVE TO NATIVE HAIR CELLS. IN PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS, WE HAVE CHARACTERIZED A NOVEL AAV-ATOH1 CONSTRUCT LEADING TO REGENERATION OF MORE MATURE HAIR CELLS IN THE MOUSE UTRICLE. WITH THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF REGENERATING HUMAN HAIR CELLS TO RESTORE BALANCE FUNCTION, TWO MAJOR OBSTACLES REMAIN: 1) WE HAVE AN INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR SIGNATURES OF HUMAN HAIR CELLS, SUPPORTING CELLS AND HAIR CELL PRECURSORS, 2) ADULT HUMAN INNER EAR TISSUES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE TO TEST PROMISING THERAPEUTICS DISCOVERED IN ANIMAL MODELS.  TO OVERCOME THESE OBSTACLES, WE HAVE DESIGNED A SURGICAL METHOD TO PROCURE LIVE UTRICLES FROM DECEASED ORGAN DONORS WHO TYPICALLY HAVE NORMAL AUDITORY AND VESTIBULAR FUNCTION. WE HAVE BEGUN ASSEMBLING THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS, SINGLE-CELL TRANSCRIPTOMES, AND HISTOLOGIC SECTIONS OF UTRICLES. IN PARALLEL, WE HAVE PROCURED UTRICLES FROM VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGICAL RESECTION. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO INCREASE THE RECRUITMENT OF ORGAN DONORS AND VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA PATIENTS AND DELINEATE AND VALIDATE THE TRANSCRIPTOMES OF HAIR CELLS, SUPPORTING CELLS, AND HAIR CELL PRECURSORS IN ADULT HUMAN UTRICLES IN THESE TWO COHORTS (AIM 1).

THERE IS NO CURE OR DISEASE-MODIFYING TREATMENT AND THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF THE DISORDER REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN. THE MOST COMMON DYSTONIA AFFECTING THE VOCAL FOLD MUSCLES IS ADDUCTOR LARYNGEAL DYSTONIA (ADLD). PEOPLE WITH ADLD SUFFER FROM A STRANGLED VOICE AND SPEECH INTERRUPTION DUE TO INVOLUNTARY SPASMS OF THE THYROARYTENOID (TA) MUSCLES. THE LONG- TERM GOAL OF THIS AWARD IS TO ELUCIDATE THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF LARYNGEAL DYSTONIA AND TO DEVELOP SENSITIVE TESTING AND NOVEL INTERVENTIONS TO TREAT THE DISEASE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT BUILDS UPON DR. KIMBERLEY'S CUTTING-EDGE WORK OF DEVELOPING A NOVEL AND VALID TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (TMS) METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS THE CORTICAL EXCITABILITY OF THE LARYNGEAL MOTOR CORTICAL AREA. RECENT FINDINGS HAVE SHOWN AN ATYPICAL PATTERN OF BRAIN ACTIVATION AND DECREASED INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION IN PEOPLE WITH ADLD. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT A 5-DAY INHIBITORY RTMS PROTOCOL TARGETED TO THE LEFT LARYNGEAL MOTOR AREA ASSOCIATED WITH THE TA MUSCLES WILL INCREASE INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION AND IMPROVE PHONATORY FUNCTION IN PEOPLE WITH ADLD. INDIVIDUALS WITH ADLD WILL PARTICIPATE IN A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLINDED, SHAM-CONTROLLED, PRELIMINARY TRIAL. THE PRIMARY TESTS WILL INCLUDE ASSESSMENTS OF PHONATORY FUNCTION (AIM 1) AND TMS-MEASURED NEUROPHYSIOLOGY (AIM 2).

THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF LTS ARE LIMITED TO SERIAL DILATION, TRACHEAL RESECTION, OR PERMANENT TRACHEOSTOMY WHICH FURTHER IMPAIRS COMMUNICATION. MEDICAL THERAPIES FOR LTS ARE LIMITED BY OUR POOR UNDERSTANDING OF LTS PATHOGENESIS. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS PROMOTING LTS IS NEEDED TO IMPROVE TREATMENT OF THIS DEBILITATING DISEASE.  PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT AN INTACT IMMUNE RESPONSE IS CRITICAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LTS. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN LTS HAS DEMONSTRATED INCREASED POPULATIONS OF CD4+ T-CELLS AND MACROPHAGES. PRELIMINARY STUDIES IN A MURINE LTS MODEL REVEAL THAT DEPLETION OF THE MACROPHAGE POPULATION ATTENUATES LTS FIBROSIS, IMPLICATING THEIR PATHOLOGIC ROLE. HOWEVER, THE LOCAL IMMUNE MEDIATORS AND CELL SIGNALING PATHWAYS PROMOTING PATHOLOGIC MACROPHAGES IN LTS ARE UNKNOWN.  MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION IS REGULATED THROUGH STIMULATION OF TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS (TLRS). TLRS ARE HIGHLY CONSERVED RECEPTORS RECOGNIZING PATHOGEN OR DAMAGE ASSOCIATED MOLECULAR PATTERNS (PAMPS/DAMPS) AND LEAD TO DOWNSTREAM ACTIVATION OF REGULATORY PROTEINS CONTROLLING PHENOTYPE. USING SINGLE CELL RNA SEQUENCING THE PI HAS DEMONSTRATES INCREASED EXPRESSION OF THE TLR4-MYD88 SIGNALING PATHWAY IN LTS MACROPHAGES. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED INCREASED EXPRESSION OF THE DAMP S100A8/A9 IN LTS TISSUE. S100A8/A9 IS A KNOWN ACTIVATOR OF TLR4-MYD88 SIGNALING, AND WORSENS FIBROSIS IN OUR MURINE LTS MODEL. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT TLR4-MYD88 SIGNALING PATHWAYS IN MACROPHAGES MAY BE CRITICAL TO LTS PATHOGENESIS. HOWEVER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN S100A8/A9, TLR4-MYD88 SIGNALING, AND PATHOLOGIC MACROPHAGES HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED IN LTS OR OTHER FIBROTIC DISEASES, AND MAY REPRESENT A CRITICAL SIGNALING AXIS DRIVING PATHOLOGIC FIBROSIS.

THE SHORTAGE OF PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE AMBULATORY VOICE BEHAVIORS IN HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS LIMITS THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN FACTORS THAT ARE CAUSATIVE VERSUS COMPENSATORY TO PHONOTRAUMA, AND THEREFORE IMPACTS OPTIMAL RISK-ASSESSMENT, MITIGATION, AND THERAPEUTIC DECISION-MAKING. RECENT WORK HAS FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH PHONOTRAUMA HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF PERSONALITY TRAITS RELATED TO SOCIAL DOMINANCE AND IMPULSIVITY AND HIGHER SPEAKING VOCAL DOSES AND INCREASED SPEAKING VOCAL INTENSITY DURING VOICE USE IN DAILY LIFE. INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT CURRENT VOCAL PATHOLOGY HAD STRONG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THOSE SAME PERSONALITY TRAITS AND VOCAL BEHAVIORS, SUGGESTING THAT PERSONALITY TRAITS AND SPEAKING VOICE USE IN DAILY LIFE COULD BE ROBUST FACTORS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHONOTRAUMA AND COULD PLAY A ROLE IN THE PROGNOSIS FOR RECOVERY. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE ENDURING ROLE THAT PERSONALITY TRAITS AND DAILY VOICE USE HAVE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHONOTRAUMA, CHANGES IN VOCAL FOLD KINEMATICS, AND ON THE ABILITY TO CHANGE DAMAGING VOCAL BEHAVIOR USING PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL METHODS. AIM 1 SEEKS TO IDENTIFY PERSONALITY AND VOCAL BEHAVIOR FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHONOTRAUMA.

POST-STROKE DEPRESSION IS ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, STUDIES OF DEPRESSION IN PWAS ONLY ASSESS DEPRESSION USING WEEKLY RETROSPECTIVE MEASURES THUS IGNORING THE DAY-TO-DAY VARIABILITY IN MOOD. AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO ASSESSING THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF DEPRESSION IS ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA).

BRYAN WARD IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, WHERE HE IS DEDICATING HIS CLINICAL PRACTICE TO VESTIBULAR DISORDERS, OTOLOGY AND NEUROTOLOGY. HE IS SEEKING A MENTORED CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD IN ORDER TO FILL KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN IMAGING OF THE INNER EAR USING MRI. HIS LONG-TERM GOAL IS ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT IS DEVOTED TO USING IMAGING TO IMPROVE THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH DIZZINESS AND IMBALANCE. THE CANDIDATE PROPOSES EXPANDING ON HIS PRIOR WORK STUDYING THE PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS ON THE INNER EAR VESTIBULAR SYSTEM TO IMAGING THE FLUID FLOW IN THE LABYRINTH OF HEALTHY CHINCHILLAS AND HUMANS. THE TRAINING PLAN IMMERSES DR. WARD IN THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF RADIOLOGY, NEUROLOGY, BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND OTOLARYNGOLOGY AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. SPECIFIC TRAINING GOALS INCLUDE: (1) RECEIVE TRAINING IN THE PHYSICS OF MRI AND HOW IMAGES ARE ACQUIRED, (2) COMPLETE TRAINING IN MRI SAFETY AND PERFORMING PROSPECTIVE STUDIES USING IMAGING MODALITIES, (3) PURSUE ADDITIONAL TRAINING IN THE ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH, AND (4) INTEGRATE HIS CLINICAL TRAINING IN VESTIBULAR DISORDERS WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE AS HE DEVELOPS INTO AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR. HIGH MAGNETIC FIELD MRIS CAN INCREASE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION OF IMAGES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO; HOWEVER, THESE MRI MACHINES ALSO CAUSE DIZZINESS AND VERTIGO IN HUMANS. WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT ALL HEALTHY HUMANS HAVE NYSTAGMUS IN AN MRI AND HYPOTHESIZED THAT THIS IS DUE TO A LORENTZ FORCE OCCURRING IN THE LABYRINTH. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO: (1) TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A LORENTZ FORCE CAUSES FLUID FLOW THAT CAN BE OBSERVED IN VIVO USING PHASE CONTRAST/FLOW IMAGING IN MRI, (2) TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A COST-EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURE THAT MINIMIZES THE RISK OF VERTIGO IN HIGH-STRENGTH MRI FIELDS, AND (3) TO IMAGE THE HUMAN LABYRINTH IN 7T AND 3T MRI COMBINING ANATOMIC AND FLOW IMAGING SEQUENCES. THE STUDY WILL INVOLVE CHINCHILLAS IN AIM 1 AND THE RECRUITMENT OF HEALTHY HUMAN PARTICIPANTS IN AIMS 2 AND 3. COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PLAN WILL PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THE CAUSE OF DIZZINESS IN STRONG MRI, A LOW-COST METHOD TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF DIZZINESS IN AN MRI REGARDLESS OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH, AND SUPPORT THAT IMPROVED MRI CAN PROVIDE HIGHER RESOLUTION IMAGES OF THE LABYRINTH. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS AWARD, THE CANDIDATE WILL BE WELL-POSITIONED TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY FOR FUNDING, HAVING ACQUIRED RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO BECOME A LEADER IN USING HIGH-STRENGTH MRI TO IDENTIFY NEW VESTIBULAR PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND IMPROVE DIAGNOSIS OF COMMON CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE DIZZINESS AND VERTIGO.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code":

DLD PLACES INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR ACADEMIC FAILURE, SOCIAL ISOLATION, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, POOR EMOTIONAL REGULATION, JUVENILE INCARCERATION (65%), AND REPEAT OFFENDING (70%). DLD PERSISTS INTO ADULTHOOD, WITH CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES INDICATING THAT 12 MILLION ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE DLD, BUT BECAUSE THE BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE CAN OVERLAP WITH THAT OF TYPICAL INDIVIDUALS', THEY MAY NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR SUPPORT SERVICES. NOTABLY, ALTHOUGH THESE YOUNG ADULTS WITH DLD \"APPEAR\" NORMAL, THEIR LANGUAGE ABILITIES ARE LINKED TO BRAIN STRUCTURE AND CORTICAL DYNAMICS THAT DIFFER QUALITATIVE FROM TYPICAL INDIVIDUALS, SUGGESTING THAT NEURAL SIGNATURE OF DLD MAY BE A CRITICAL MARKER OF THE DISORDER. NEW MACHINE LEARNING METHODS HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE NEUROSCIENCE OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS AND ADVANCES IN REGISTERING THE OPTICAL SIGNAL OF FUNCTIONAL NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (FNIRS) TO NEUROANATOMICAL DATA NOW MAKE CAPTURING THE SPATIAL- TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF SPOKEN LANGUAGE PROCESSING FEASIBLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE FOR SPEECH, LANGUAGE, AND HEARING POPULATIONS.

THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR SEVERE-TO-PROFOUND HEARING LOSS IN CHILDREN IS COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION. THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT (CI) IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND WIDELY USED SENSORY PROSTHESIS IN HUMANS AND COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION HAS RESTORED HEARING TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AROUND THE WORLD.

FXS IS CAUSED BY THE ABSENCE OF FRAGILE X MENTAL RETARDATION PROTEIN (FMRP), WHICH IS KNOWN TO BIND SPECIFIC MRNAS AND REPRESS THEIR TRANSLATION. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW FMRP IMPACTS THE CENTRAL AUDITORY PATHWAY. WE WILL STUDY FMRP EFFECTS ON GENE EXPRESSION IN THE AUDITORY BRAINSTEM, USING THE WELL-ESTABLISHED FMR1-KNOCKOUT (KO) MOUSE MODEL, WHICH EXHIBITS AUDITORY HYPERSENSITIVITY AND SEIZURES IN RESPONSE TO LOUD NOISE. ALTHOUGH THE WELL-ESTABLISHED ROLE OF FMRP IS TRANSLATIONAL REPRESSION, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN RECENTLY IN NEURONS THAT FMRP CAN ALSO CHANGE THE LEVEL OF MANY MRNAS. WHETHER THIS OCCURS IN THE AUDITORY BRAINSTEM IS UNKNOWN. WE HAVE NOVEL TRANSCRIPTOME DATA (UNPUBLISHED) SHOWING THAT THE LEVELS OF MANY MRNAS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE BOUND BY FMRP, AND TO FUNCTION IN SYNAPTIC PATHWAYS, ARE DECREASED IN THE FMR1-KO COCHLEAR NUCLEUS. HOW THIS OCCURS IS NOT KNOWN. AIM 1 WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT DIRECT FMRP BINDING STABILIZES THE BOUND MRNA, BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF FMRP, THESE MRNAS HAVE DECREASED STABILITY (AND, THEREFORE, DECREASED LEVEL). WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE IF DECREASED STABILIZATION OF MRNA LEADS TO DECREASED PROTEIN LEVEL OR IF IT IS OFFSET BY THE LOSS OF FMRP-MEDIATED TRANSLATIONAL REPRESSION SO AS TO MANIFEST AS INCREASED PROTEIN LEVEL. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT FMRP ACTS INDIRECTLY THROUGH TRANSLATIONAL REPRESSION OF FACTORS, SUCH NONSENSE-MEDIATED MRNA DECAY (NMD) FACTOR, UPF1. UNPUBLISHED DATA FROM MY RESEARCH MENTOR\u2019S LAB HAS SHOWN THAT INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS DERIVED FROM FXS-PATIENT FIBROBLASTS MANIFEST AN ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVEL OF UPF1 (WHOSE MRNA IS BOUND BY FMRP), RESULTING IN HYPERACTIVATED NMD AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, REDUCED LEVELS OF CELLULAR NMD TARGET MRNAS. BASED ON THESE DATA, AIM 2 WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT NMD IS HYPERACTIVATED IN FMR1-KO COCHLEAR NUCLEUS, LEADING TO GENE DOWNREGULATION. LASTLY, IT IS KNOWN THAT FMRP IS INVOLVED IN ACTIVITY DEPENDENT PROCESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, DENDRITIC LOCALIZATION OF FMRP IS INCREASED WITH GLUTAMATERGIC SIGNALING AND LOSS OF AFFERENT ACTIVITY CAN BLUNT TRANSLATIONAL REPRESSION BY FMRP. AIM 3 WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE FMRP EFFECTS ON GENE EXPRESSION ARE DEPENDENT ON AFFERENT ACTIVITY.

UNILATERAL STROKE OF THE LEFT- HEMISPHERE CAUSES READING AND LANGUAGE DEFICITS IN 21-58% OF STROKE SURVIVORS AND THESE DEFICITS PERSIST CHRONICALLY, DESPITE PARTICIPATION IN THERAPY. THE MAJORITY OF THE AVAILABLE READING TREATMENTS SHOW THE CLEAREST BENEFITS ON TRAINED MATERIALS. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR NEW TREATMENT STRATEGIES THAT CAN GENERALIZE OUTSIDE OF THE TREATMENT CONTEXT. BIOLOGICALLY-BASED INTERVENTIONS CAN MEET THIS CHALLENGE BY DIRECTLY INFLUENCING BENEFICIAL POST-STROKE PLASTICITY. FOR EXAMPLE, REAL-TIME FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING NEUROFEEDBACK (FMRI NFB) IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH ALLOWING PARTICIPANTS TO REGULATE THEIR OWN BRAIN ACTIVITY. IT USES A COMBINATION OF MENTAL STRATEGIES AND CONCURRENT BRAIN ACTIVITY FEEDBACK. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT REPEATED EFFORTS TO SELF-REGULATE BRAIN ACTIVITY LEAD TO LEARNING-INDUCED NEURAL CHANGES. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT REAL-TIME FMRI NFB CAN IMPROVE POST-STROKE MOTOR AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION. THE MAIN GOAL OF THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IS TO BUILD ON THIS SUCCESS AND TO ADVANCE BIOLOGICALLY-INSPIRED INTERVENTIONS FOR READING. STRONG PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT REDUCED RECRUITMENT OF THE INTACT LEFT-HEMISPHERE READING AREAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBOPTIMAL READING OUTCOMES AFTER STROKE. IN ADDITION, PILOT DATA SUGGEST THAT RIGHT HAND FINGER TAP IMAGERY CAN EFFECTIVELY ACTIVATE THE LEFT INFERIOR PARIETAL REGION THOUGHT TO SUPPORT BINDING OF VISUAL ORTHOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WITH SOUND REPRESENTATIONS DURING READING. GIVEN THAT DIFFICULTY WITH ORTHOGRAPHY- PHONOLOGY CONVERSION IS THE MOST COMMON DEFICIT AMONG LEFT-HEMISPHERE STROKE SURVIVORS, THE CURRENT PROJECT PROPOSES TO USE RIGHT HAND FINGER TAP IMAGERY IN COMBINATION WITH FMRI NFB TO HELP RE-INSTATE LEFT INFERIOR PARIETAL ACTIVITY DURING READING. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT EFFORTS TO INCREASE READING-RELATED BRAIN ACTIVATION IN THE LEFT-HEMISPHERE WILL RE-ENGAGE THE IMPAIRED READING MECHANISMS AND MAY ALLEVIATE READING DEFICITS. UNDER THIS K01 AWARD, THE APPLICANT WILL DEVELOP SKILLS NECESSARY TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, NAMELY IN CARRYING OUT CLINICAL TRIALS USING FMRI NFB AND MOTOR IMAGERY. THIS PROJECT HAS 3 SPECIFIC AIMS. UNDER AIM 1, THE APPLICANT WILL BECOME PROFICIENT IN SPECIFIC HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PRE- AND POST-PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS OF FMRI NFB, GAIN NFB RESEARCH EXPERIENCE, AND ACQUIRE CRITICAL SKILLS IN MOTOR IMAGERY AND CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN. IN AIM 2, THE APPLICANT WILL APPLY THIS TRAINING TO CONDUCT A CLINICAL TRIAL FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR A COMBINED FMRI NFB AND MOTOR IMAGERY REHABILITATION OF READING IMPAIRMENTS IN LEFT-HEMISPHERE STROKE. LASTLY, UNDER AIM 3, THE APPLICANT WILL CHARACTERIZE THE NEURAL MECHANISMS OF READING IN SUBACUTE STROKE. AT THE END OF THIS AWARD PERIOD, THE APPLICANT WILL DEVELOP A VALID AND RELIABLE PARADIGM FOR A NEUROSCIENCE-BASED READING INTERVENTION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE HOW READING DEFICITS ARE TREATED.

THIS IS HYPOTHESIZED TO PLAY A CAUSAL ROLE IN THE COMPREHENSION OF SENTENCE STRUCTURE, BUT SUCH A ROLE HAS NEVER BEEN DEMONSTRATED. AIM 1 WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY DIRECTLY ELECTRICALLY STIMULATING AND THUS TRANSIENTLY DISRUPTING THE LEFT IFG AND STS OF NEUROSURGICAL PATIENT VOLUNTEERS AT KEY PHRASAL BOUNDARIES IN A SENTENCE AND OBSERVING HOW THIS AFFECTS SENTENCE COMPREHENSION ACCURACY. AIM 2 WILL INVESTIGATE A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN NEURAL ACTIVITY AND THE RESULTING BEHAVIOR FOR EACH TRIAL USING A SELF-PACED READING TASK WHILE WE RECORD NEURAL ACTIVITY DIRECTLY FROM KEY LANGUAGE NETWORK SITES, SPECIFICALLY THE LEFT IFG AND STS.

PEOPLE WITH NORMAL HEARING THRESHOLDS OFTEN COMPLAIN OF DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING SPEECH-IN-NOISE, AND LISTENERS WITH SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS (SNHL) SHOW SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN SPEECH PERCEPTION, EVEN WHEN AUDIBILITY IS RESTORED. ANIMAL MODELS OF SNHL AND TEMPORAL BONE HISTOLOGY SUGGEST THAT PERIPHERAL PATHOLOGY MISSED BY THE AUDIOGRAM MAY EXPLAIN SOME OF THIS VARIANCE. OUTER HAIR CELL (OHC) DYSFUNCTION ELEVATES HEARING THRESHOLDS, BUT INNER HAIR CELL (IHC) AND AUDITORY NERVE (AN) DYSFUNCTION MAY BE HIDDEN FROM THE AUDIOGRAM DESPITE THEIR IMPACT ON NEURAL ENCODING OF SOUND. THE PRESENCE OF SPECIFIC COCHLEAR PATHOLOGIES AND THEIR RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION TO PERCEPTION, HOWEVER, CANNOT BE DIRECTLY TESTED IN HUMANS. INSTEAD, NON-INVASIVE BIOMARKERS OF PATHOLOGY ARE USED. THOUGH DIAGNOSTICS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR IDENTIFYING HIDDEN PATHOLOGIES IN PEOPLE WITH NORMAL HEARING, AN INDIVIDUAL METRIC IS UNLIKELY TO BE ENOUGH WHEN SNHL RESULTS FROM A COMBINATION OF PERIPHERAL DYSFUNCTIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, WE USE A BATTERY OF NON-INVASIVE DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS TO DETERMINE A BIOMARKER PROFILE FOR INDIVIDUAL SUBJECTS AND ASSESS ITS RELATIONSHIP TO COCHLEAR ANATOMY AND SPEECH-IN-NOISE PERCEPTION WHEN THERE ARE VARYING DEGREES OF OHC AND NON-OHC DYSFUNCTIONS. THIS PROPOSAL TESTS OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT IDENTIFYING SUBTYPES OF SNHL FROM INTEGRATION OF BIOMARKERS SENSITIVE TO BOTH OHC AND NON-OHC PATHOLOGIES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PREDICTION OF SUPRATHRESHOLD HEARING OVER THE AUDIOGRAM ALONE. USING A CROSS-SPECIES APPROACH, THREE SYNERGISTIC SPECIFIC AIMS TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS. FIRST, WE ASSESS THE DIFFERENCES IN BIOMARKER PROFILES OF TWO CHINCHILLA MODELS OF DISTINCT SNHL SUBTYPES, OHC-ONLY HEARING LOSS AND COMPLEX SNHL (E.G., A COMBINATION OF OHC, IHC, AND AN DYSFUNCTION), TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF NON-OHC PATHOLOGIES WHEN THEY CO-OCCUR WITH OHC DYSFUNCTION. SECOND, WE MEASURE PHYSIOLOGICAL BIOMARKER PROFILES IN HUMANS WITH SNHL AND TEST WHETHER THEY BETTER PREDICT SPEECH UNDERSTANDING THAN THE AUDIOGRAM. THIRD, USING OUR COORDINATED PHYSIOLOGICAL TEST BATTERY AS A LINK BETWEEN SPECIES, WE MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING COCHLEAR PATHOLOGY DISTRIBUTIONS IN HUMANS WITH COMPLEX SNHL BASED ON OUR HISTOLOGY FROM CHINCHILLAS WITH KNOWN EXPOSURES.

DYSFUNCTION IN THESE REGIONS HAS BEEN TIED TO A VARIETY OF MOTOR AND LANGUAGE DEFICITS INCLUDING ISSUES WITH MOTOR INITIATION AND SEQUENCING, ARTICULATION, AND SENTENCE PLANNING AS WELL AS SPEECH DISORDERS INCLUDING DEVELOPMENTAL STUTTERING. THE SMA HAS BEEN STUDIED WITH RESPECT TO VOCALIZATION IN NON- HUMAN PRIMATE MODELS, BUT THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF THE PRESMA AND SMA IN LANGUAGE PRODUCTION CAN ONLY BE EXPLORED IN HUMANS. WHILE THERE ARE MULTIPLE MOTOR AND SPEECH-CRITICAL CORTICAL AREAS IN THE MEDIAL FRONTAL WALL, THIS PROPOSAL HYPOTHESIZES THAT THE PRESMA AND SMA HAVE UNIQUE ROLES IN BOTH SPEECH/LANGUAGE AND MOTOR PRODUCTION, WITH THE FORMER INVOLVED IN SELECTION OF ACTION AND THE LATTER IN SEQUENCING OF ACTION. BY HYPOTHESIS, PRESMA IS INVOLVED IN SELECTION OF ELEMENTS AND SEQUENCES IN LANGUAGE AND MOTOR FUNCTIONS, WHILE SMA SEQUENCING OF SPEECH AND MOTOR PROGRAMS (E.G. ARTICULATION). WHILE THESE REGIONS INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT SUBCORTICAL AND CORTICAL REGIONS, SEQUENCE VS. SELECTION IS A CRITICAL VARIABLE THAT DISTINGUISHES ACTIVATION IN THESE REGIONS IN BOTH LANGUAGE AND MOTOR TASKS. CRITICALLY, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE SAME REGIONS PERFORM SELECTION (PRESMA) AND SEQUENCING (SMA) IN MOTOR AND LANGUAGE TASKS.

MANY TG INDIVIDUALS REPORT THAT PRODUCING A VOICE CONGRUENT WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY IS CRUCIAL TO AFFIRMING THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF GENDER AFFIRMING SERVICES AVAILABLE, BUT MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS SURGERY OR HORMONES DO NOT DO NOT ENSURE SATISFACTION WITH VOCAL GENDER.

ONE OF THE PRIMARY GOALS FOR VOICE MODIFICATION IS TO ALTER FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY (FO) TOWARDS SEX-NORMATIVE VALUES, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE UNDERLYING CHANGES TO VOCALIZATION REQUIRED TO HABITUATE A DESIRED FO. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE COMPENSATORY STRATEGIES USED BY TG INDIVIDUALS TO ATTAIN A DESIRED FO ARE CHARACTERIZED BY ATYPICAL PATTERNS OF VOCALIZATION, CONSISTENT WITH VOCAL HYPERFUNCTION (VH).

IN FACT, EVEN BASIC MECHANISMS IN ADAPTATION, SUCH AS WHICH FACTORS DRIVE THE LEARNING (I.E., ADAPTING TO COMPENSATE FOR AUDITORY PERTURBATIONS LIKE FORMANT SHIFTS) AND UNLEARNING (I.E., RETURNING TO THE BASELINE MOVEMENTS UPON THE REMOVAL OF THE PREVIOUSLY APPLIED AUDITORY PERTURBATION) PROCESSES REMAIN LARGELY UNCLEAR. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE HYPOTHESIZED THAT AUDITORY-MOTOR ADAPTATION MAY RESULT FROM MINIMIZING AUDITORY PREDICTION ERRORS\u2013THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN PREDICTED AUDITORY CONSEQUENCES OF MOTOR COMMANDS AND ACTUAL AUDITORY FEEDBACK. TO DATE, HOWEVER, THIS FUNDAMENTAL HYPOTHESIS REMAINS SURPRISINGLY UNDERINVESTIGATED. HENCE, THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH COMBINES COMPUTATIONAL (AIM 1) AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL (AIM 2) APPROACHES TO DIRECTLY EXAMINE WHETHER AUDITORY PREDICTION ERRORS ARE THE PRIMARY FACTOR DRIVING SPEECH AUDITORY-MOTOR ADAPTATION. AS A PART OF THE FIRST SPECIFIC AIM, SEVERAL NEW VERSIONS OF A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL, FEEDBACK AWARENESS CONTROL OF TASKS IN SPEECH (FACTS) WILL BE DEVELOPED TO SIMULATE AUDITORY-MOTOR ADAPTATION. THE NEW VERSIONS OF FACTS WILL BE TESTED AND VALIDATED IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE MECHANISTIC ROLE OF AUDITORY PREDICTION ERRORS IN ADAPTATION. AIM 2 WILL USE MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY IMAGING TO EXAMINE SPEAKING-INDUCED SUPPRESSION (SIS)\u2014SUPPRESSION OF AUDITORY RESPONSES TO SELF-PRODUCED SPEECH COMPARED TO THE RESPONSES TO PASSIVELY HEARD SPEECH\u2014WHICH IS THOUGHT TO REPRESENT AUDITORY PREDICTION ERRORS. HERE, WHOLE-BRAIN DATA DRIVEN ANALYSES OF SIS WILL BE EXAMINED DURING A SERIES OF AUDITORY-MOTOR ADAPTATION TASKS. IN BOTH AIMS, AUDITORY-MOTOR ADAPTATION TO BOTH SPECTRAL PERTURBATIONS (I.E., ADAPTATION TO PERTURBED FORMANT FREQUENCIES) AND TEMPORAL PERTURBATIONS (I.E., ADAPTATION TO LENGTHENED VOICE ONSET TIME) WILL BE EXAMINED. TOGETHER, THIS COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL MODELING AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL APPROACH WILL OFFER KEY MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS INTO THE NEURAL BASIS OF AUDITORY-MOTOR ADAPTATION. THE IMMEDIATE OUTCOME MAY PROVIDE THE FIRST DIRECT EVIDENCE FOR THE CRITICAL ROLE OF AUDITORY PREDICTION ERRORS IN AUDITORY-MOTOR ADAPTATION, WITH PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL. THE BROADER IMPACT OF THE WORK MAY ESTABLISH A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR NOVEL TREATMENT STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE SPEECH MOTOR TREATMENT EFFICACY IN CLINICAL POPULATIONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bb8d1cd4-e0ae-6348-a07c-04df6a112768-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32DC019538_7529"}, {"internal_id": 133585279, "Award ID": "F32DC019535", "Award Amount": 142814.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-14", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "DIFFERENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF DOMAIN-GENERAL CEREBELLAR TIMING MECHANISMS TO TEMPORAL DEFICITS IN ATAXIC DYSARTHRIA - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  SPOKEN LANGUAGE USES PRECISE SUB-SECOND TIMING TO MARK PHONEMIC CONTRASTS, LEXICAL STRESS DIFFERENCES, AND PHRASAL BOUNDARIES, AMONG OTHER DISTINCTIONS. ATAXIC DYSARTHRIA IS A SPEECH MOTOR DISEASE CAUSED BY DAMAGE TO OR DEGENERATION OF THE CEREBELLUM AND IS LINKED TO A VARIETY OF TEMPORAL DEFICITS, INCLUDING REDUCED CONTRAST BETWEEN TEMPORAL CATEGORIES IN SPEECH AND IRREGULAR SPEECH RATE AND RHYTHM. THESE SYMPTOMS RESULT IN DECREASED SPEECH NATURALNESS AND INTELLIGIBILITY, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING QUALITY OF LIFE. WHILE THE TEMPORAL SYMPTOMS OF ATAXIC DYSARTHRIA ARE WELL ESTABLISHED, THEIR UNDERLYING CAUSES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS TO IMPROVE SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY AND NATURALNESS IN THIS POPULATION.  THE EXPERIMENTS IN THIS PROPOSAL TEST HOW IMPAIRMENTS TO TWO DOMAIN-GENERAL FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBELLUM LEAD TO SPECIFIC SUBSETS OF TEMPORAL DEFICITS IN THE SPEECH OF INDIVIDUALS WITH ATAXIC DYSARTHRIA. IN THE FIRST AIM, WE TEST HOW DAMAGE TO THE DOMAIN-GENERAL TIMING FUNCTION CONTRIBUTES TO DEFICITS IN PRODUCING CATEGORICAL TEMPORAL CONTRASTS. THE CEREBELLUM IS INVOLVED IN THE CONTROL OF EVENT TIMING, WHICH DEALS WITH THE DURATION OF SINGLE EVEN OR MULTIPLE IRREGULAR EVENTS, BUT NOT IN RELATIVE TIMING, WHICH DEALS WITH THE TIMING OF MULTIPLE REGULAR EVENTS. THIS LEADS TO DIFFERENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS IN THE PERCEPTION AND PRODUCTION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TIMING TASKS. WE USE A SUITE OF PERCEPTUAL AND PRODUCTION TASKS IN BOTH SPEECH AND NON-SPEECH DOMAINS TO ESTABLISH WHICH ASPECTS OF SPEECH TIMING ARE CONTROLLED BY EVENT TIMING. TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE CONTROL OF EVENT TIMING LARGELY AFFECTS CATEGORIES BUT NOT PROSODIC CHARACTERISTICS, WE ALSO COMPARE PERFORMANCE ON THESE TASKS WITH EVALUATIONS OF RHYTHMIC DEFICITS IN SPEECH.  IN THE SECOND AIM, WE TEST HOW DAMAGE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF FORWARD MODELS AND CONSEQUENT INCREASED RELIANCE ON FEEDBACK LEAD TO ALTERED SPEECH RHYTHM AND OVERLY VARIABLE SEGMENT DURATIONS. SPEAKERS CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR THEIR OWN SPEECH TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ACCURATELY PRODUCING SPEECH TARGETS; INDIVIDUALS WITH CEREBELLAR DAMAGE SHOW INCREASED DEPENDENCE ON TEMPORALLY DELAYED FEEDBACK TO CORRECT ONGOING MOVEMENTS, RATHER THAN RELYING ON ACCURATE FORWARD MODELS OF PRODUCTION. WE USE TWO ALTERED AUDITORY FEEDBACK STUDIES TO TEST THE TEMPORAL EFFECTS OF PERCEIVED ERRORS IN VOWEL TARGET ATTAINMENT. WE DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH RELIANCE ON FEEDBACK FOR SPATIAL ACCURACY DISTURBS TEMPORAL ACCURACY. WE ALSO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MAGNITUDE OF TEMPORAL DISTURBANCES IN THESE EXPERIMENTS AND OVERALL SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL INACCURACY IN SPEECH.

SOUND LOCALIZATION IN HORIZONTAL SPACE IS ACHIEVED BY DETECTING THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME BY WHICH SOUND ARRIVES AT EACH EAR, THE INTERAURAL TIME DIFFERENCE (ITD). HUMANS PERCEIVE THESE ITDS WITH ANGULAR SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF 1\u00b0 AND TIME RESOLUTION OF TEN MICROSECONDS, THE LATTER BEING ~3 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE FASTER THAN THE SCALE AT WHICH NEURONS NORMALLY OPERATE. HOW THIS IS ACHIEVED ON A SUBCELLULAR LEVEL IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD. THE SUBSTRATE FOR ITD PROCESSING BEGINS WITH A DENDRITIC COMPUTATION DEEP WITHIN THE AUDITORY BRAINSTEM IN AN AREA KNOWN AS THE MEDIAL SUPERIOR OLIVE (MSO). WITHIN THE NEURAL CIRCUITRY, EXCITATORY INPUT FROM EACH EAR ONTO MSO NEURONS IS EXQUISITELY SEGREGATED VIA THE DENDRITIC ANATOMY: THE LATERAL DENDRITE AND MEDIAL DENDRITE RECEIVE INPUT EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE IPSILATERAL EAR OR CONTRALATERAL EAR, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTING POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS TRAVEL DOWN EACH DENDRITE TO CONJOIN AT THE SOMA, WHERE THEIR RELATIVE TEMPORAL SYNCHRONY IS COMPARED, A PROCESS TERMED BINAURAL COINCIDENCE DETECTION. FOR OPTIMAL COINCIDENCE, THE EXTERNAL ACOUSTIC DELAY IS PRECISELY COMPENSATED FOR BY AN INTERNAL DELAY, ALLOWING FOR NEAR SIMULTANEOUS ARRIVAL OF BINAURAL INPUTS AT THE SOMA. THIS INTERNAL DELAY WAS TRADITIONALLY ASSUMED TO DERIVE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE PHYSICAL PATH LENGTHS OF INCOMING AXONS (THE CLASSIC \u2018JEFFRESS MODEL\u2019), BUT ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF INTERNAL DELAY HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, MOST NOTABLY ONE INVOLVING GLYCINERGIC INHIBITION. DESPITE THEIR CRITICAL ROLE AS THE LOCI OF BINAURAL COINCIDENCE DETECTION, LARGELY OVERLOOKED IS THE IDEA OF THE DENDRITES THEMSELVES AS SOURCES OF INTERNAL DELAY. ALL MODELS OF MSO PROCESSING HAVE EITHER OMITTED DENDRITES COMPLETELY OR TREATED THEM AS IDENTICAL IN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES. BECAUSE POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS TAKE TIME TO PROPAGATE DOWN EACH DENDRITE TO THE SOMA, THAT TRAVEL TIME IS LIKELY AFFECTED BY DENDRITIC STRUCTURE (E.G., PATH LENGTH OF TRAVEL) AS WELL AS THE DISTAL DENDRITIC LOCATION AND SPATIAL SPREAD OF EACH AXON\u2019S MULTIPLE SYNAPSES. ASYMMETRIES PRESENT IN EITHER MEASURE COULD GREATLY INFLUENCE THE ARRIVAL TIME OF POSTSYNAPTIC INPUT FROM EACH EAR AT THE SOMA.

ACCORDING TO THE NIDCD, ROUGHLY 1 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE SOME FORM OF APHASIA, OR LOSS OF LINGUISTIC ABILITY. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE DEVASTATING FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. THE POWER OF LANGUAGE DERIVES FROM A UNIQUE EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT: SYNTAX, THE ABSTRACT RULES THAT ALLOW US TO COMBINE FINITE WORDS INTO INFINITELY MANY POSSIBLE STRINGS. WITHOUT SYNTAX, COMMUNICATION IS PAINSTAKING AND ERROR-PRONE. DESPITE ITS CENTRALITY, LITTLE REMAINS KNOWN ABOUT ITS NEURAL INSTANTIATION. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS ATTEMPTED TO EXPERIMENTALLY ISOLATE SYNTAX SO AS TO LOCALIZE IT IN THE BRAIN, BUT THIS APPROACH HAS PRODUCED MIXED AND INCONSISTENT RESULTS. WE TAKE A NOVEL APPROACH, USING ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY (ECOG) TO INVESTIGATE A WELL- DEFINED COMPONENT OF SYNTAX: SEQUENCING, OR SELECTING WORDS IN AN ORDER DETERMINED BY SYNTAX. A MAIN IMPEDIMENT TO PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING SYNTAX AT THE NEURAL LEVEL IS A GRANULARITY MISMATCH PROBLEM. NEUROSCIENCE TENDS TO DEAL IN BROADER CONCEPTUAL DISTINCTIONS, AS EVIDENCED BY EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS THAT ATTEMPT TO ISOLATE ALL OF SYNTAX. HOWEVER, PSYCHOLINGUISTIC MODELS TEND TO BE MUCH FINER GRAINED, PORTRAYING SYNTACTIC ABILITIES AS A CONGLOMERATE OF PROCESSES AND REPRESENTATIONS RATHER THAN A MONOLITHIC ENTITY THAT CAN BE TURNED ON OR OFF. HERE, WE LEVERAGE COMPUTATIONALLY EXPLICIT MODELS TO MAKE LINKING HYPOTHESES BETWEEN COGNITIVE PROCESSES AND COMMENSURATE NEURAL MECHANISMS. FOR INSTANCE, SEQUENCING CRITICALLY RELIES ON A BINDING MECHANISM FOR LINKING PARTICULAR WORDS TO POSITIONS IN A SYNTACTIC TREE. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT BINDING BETWEEN SYNTAX AND WORDS IS INSTANTIATED AS NEURAL SYNCHRONY BETWEEN REGIONS ENCODING SYNTAX AND THOSE ENCODING WORDS. OUR APPROACH HAS A NUMBER OF STRENGTHS. (1) AS ECOG IS LARGELY INSENSITIVE TO PRODUCTION ARTIFACTS, WE WILL EMPLOY A PRODUCTION PARADIGM, ALLOWING US TO MORE CLEARLY ISOLATE PARTICULAR SYNTACTIC PROCESSES THAN TRADITIONAL COMPREHENSION STUDIES.

THIS PROPOSAL CONCERNS NCRNA IN THE DROSOPHILA ANTENNA, WITH A FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULARLY INTRIGUING NCRNA. IN PRELIMINARY WORK, I CHARACTERIZED THE ANTENNAL NCRNA LANDSCAPE OF D.

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MUST DISSOCIATE VOCAL FEEDBACK FROM OTHER SOUNDS. TO MAKE THIS DISTINCTION, VOCAL MOTOR-RELATED SIGNALS ARE HARNESSED TO SELECTIVELY SUPPRESS RESPONSES OF AUDITORY NEURONS TO PREDICTABLE ACOUSTIC FEATURES OF VOCAL FEEDBACK. THIS PREDICTIVE SUPPRESSION ENHANCES THE DETECTION OF SOUNDS THAT OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH VOCAL FEEDBACK AND ALSO FACILITATES THE DETECTION OF VOCAL ERRORS, A PROCESS IMPORTANT TO VOCAL LEARNING. IN CONTRAST, DYSFUNCTIONAL SUPPRESSION IS THOUGHT TO GIVE RISE TO AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS IN DISORDERS LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE PROMINENCE OF PREDICTIVE VOCAL SUPPRESSION IN THE AUDITORY CORTEX HAS BEEN MOST THOROUGHLY DEMONSTRATED WITH NONINVASIVE RECORDINGS IN SPEAKING HUMANS AND EXTRACELLULAR RECORDINGS FROM PYRAMIDAL NEURONS IN VOCALIZING MONKEYS. HOWEVER, THE CELLULAR DETERMINANTS OF PREDICTIVE VOCAL SUPPRESSION ARE UNKNOWN BECAUSE THE AUDITORY CORTEX OF MONKEYS AND HUMANS IS NOT READILY AMENABLE TO ADVANCED GENETIC METHODS USEFUL FOR CIRCUIT INTERROGATION. WHILE OUR GROUP PREVIOUSLY FOUND THAT MOUSE AUDITORY CORTEX WAS SUPPRESSED DURING VOCALIZATION, THESE RECORDINGS WERE CONDUCTED DURING COURTSHIP, A STATE THAT ALSO FEATURES LOCOMOTION, AROUSAL, AND OLFACTORY STIMULATION, ALL OF WHICH BROADLY SUPPRESS PYRAMIDAL NEURON ACTIVITY. I HAVE DEVELOPED A NOVEL SOCIAL INTERACTION PARADIGM IN WHICH I CAN MONITOR VOCALIZATIONS, LOCOMOTION, AND AROUSAL WHILE CONDUCTING MULTIPHOTON IMAGING THE ACTIVITY OF PYRAMIDAL NEURONS AND INTERNEURONS IN THE MOUSE AUDITORY CORTEX. I HAVE COMBINED THIS PARADIGM WITH SOUND PRESENTATIONS TO TEST THE EXCITABILITY OF AUDITORY CORTICAL NEURONS DURING VOCAL AND NON-VOCAL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. IN AIM 1, I WILL USE THIS APPROACH TO MEASURE SUPPRESSION RELATED TO VOCALIZATION, LOCOMOTION, AND AROUSAL DURING SOCIAL INTERACTIONS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT VOCALIZATION CORRESPONDS WITH SPECIFIC SUPPRESSION OF PYRAMIDAL NEURONS THAT RESPOND TO VOCAL FEEDBACK AND ACTIVATION OF CERTAIN INTERNEURONS, WHILE NON-VOCAL FACETS OF COURTSHIP SUPPRESS A BROADER POPULATION OF NEURONS. IN AIM 2.1, I WILL IMAGE FROM THE AUDITORY CORTEX WHILE SYSTEMATICALLY DISTORTING VOCAL FEEDBACK WITH AIR ENRICHED WITH GRADATIONS OF HELIUM TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT VOCAL SUPPRESSION IS PREDICTIVE OF VOCAL FEEDBACK. IN AIM 2.2, I WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT VOCAL SUPPRESSION RELIES ON STRONG ACTIVATION OF INTERNEURONS BY VOCAL MOTOR-RELATED SIGNALS BY IMAGING FROM THE AUDITORY CORTEX OF VOCALIZING, CONGENITALLY DEAF MICE. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL TEST THE SPECIFICITY AND PREDICTIVE POWER OF VOCAL SUPPRESSION IN THE MOUSE AUDITORY CORTEX WHILE PROVIDING CELLULAR RESOLUTION OF ITS UNDERLYING MECHANISMS.

MANY NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. REPLACING THESE LOST OR DAMAGED NEURONS TO RESTORE NORMAL BRAIN FUNCTION THROUGH STEM CELL-BASED THERAPIES HAS LONG BEEN A MAJOR GOAL IN THE FIGHT AGAINST NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. HOWEVER, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT EITHER WHY CERTAIN POPULATIONS OF NEURONS ARE SELECTIVELY VULNERABLE TO CELL DEATH, OR HOW FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION OF STEM CELL-DERIVED NEURONS CAN BE PROMOTED. FEW AREAS OF THE MAMMALIAN BRAIN RETAIN THE CAPACITY TO GENERATE NEW NEURONS IN ADULTHOOD. UNDERSTANDING HOW ENDOGENOUSLY GENERATED STEM CELL-DERIVED NEURONS CAN SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE WITHOUT DISRUPTING EXISTING CIRCUITS MAY PROVIDE IMPORTANT MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS INTO THE SUCCESSFUL THERAPEUTIC USE OF STEM CELL-DERIVED NEURONS. DOPAMINERGIC (DA) NEURONS IN THE MOUSE OLFACTORY BULB (OB) ARE A HIGHLY ACTIVITY DEPENDENT POPULATION, WITH A SUBSET UNDERGOING CELL DEATH WHEN SENSORY INPUT IS BLOCKED. DA NEURONS ARE ALSO GENERATED CONTINUOUSLY THROUGHOUT LIFE FROM PROGENITOR CELLS IN THE SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE. THESE TWO PROPERTIES MAKE OB DA NEURONS AN IDEAL MODEL SYSTEM IN WHICH TO INVESTIGATE THE DETERMINANTS OF BOTH SELECTIVE VULNERABILITY AND NEWBORN NEURON INTEGRATION. TO DO SO, I WILL EMPLOY AN EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM THAT ENABLES SENSORY INPUT TO BE ELIMINATED AND THEN GRADUALLY RESTORED. I HAVE TWO AIMS IN THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST, I WILL DETERMINE THE SIZE OF OB DA NEURONS THAT ARE VULNERABLE OR RESILIENT TO CELL DEATH DURING LOSS OF SENSORY INPUT AND THE LOCATION OF NEWBORN NEURONS THAT INTEGRATE ONCE SENSORY INPUT IS RESTORED. SECOND, I WILL DETERMINE THE ODOR RESPONSE PROPERTIES OF VULNERABLE, RESILIENT AND NEWBORN OB DA NEURONS WHEN ODOR INPUT IS REMOVED AND THEN RESTORED. BASED ON PREVIOUS STUDIES, I PREDICT THAT A SUBTYPE OF SMALL, POSTNATALLY-GENERATED DA NEURONS WILL BE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO CELL DEATH BUT CAN BE FUNCTIONALLY REPLACED BY ONGOING NEUROGENESIS WHEN SENSORY INPUT IS RESTORED. I WILL USE CHRONIC IN VIVO 2-PHOTON STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING TO TRACK THE SURVIVAL AND INTEGRATION OF INDIVIDUAL NEURONS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME (10 WEEKS). BY TRACKING THE SIZE AND ODOR RESPONSE PROPERTIES OF DA NEURONS, I WILL BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHETHER THESE IMPORTANT PROPERTIES DIFFER BETWEEN VULNERABLE AND RESILIENT NEURONS, AND ALSO TO DETERMINE WHETHER NEWBORN NEURONS CAN FUNCTIONALLY REPLACE LOST NEURONS IN OB CIRCUITS.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CODE-SWITCHING (ALTERNATION BETWEEN LANGUAGE IN A SINGLE UTTERANCE) IS A COMMON PHENOMENON OBSERVED AMONG BILINGUAL CHILDREN WITH TYPICAL AND ATYPICAL LANGUAGE, INCLUDING CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL LANGUAGE DISORDER (DLD). CODE-SWITCHING REQUIRES THE SPEAKER TO INTEGRATE MORPHOSYNTACTIC FEATURES IN BOTH LANGUAGES; THEREFORE, LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY AND SOCIAL FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN ANALYZING CODE- SWITCHING PATTERNS. CURRENT RESEARCH ON CODE-SWITCHING IN CHILDREN WITH DLD IS LIMITED BY METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES, INCLUDING PROBLEMS WITH CODING APPROACHES, ELICITATION TASKS, AND ACCOUNTING FOR CHILDREN'S LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, THIS PROPOSED STUDY WILL USE A COMPREHENSIVE CODING METHOD AND A CONVERSATIONAL ELICITATION TASK TO EXAMINE CODE-SWITCHING PATTERNS IN BILINGUAL CHILDREN WITH AND WITHOUT DLD. THE STUDY WILL CONSIDER TWO PERSPECTIVES, LINGUISTIC AND SOCIOLINGUISTIC, TO UNDERSTAND HOW LANGUAGE ABILITY INTERACTS WITH THIS PHENOMENON.

T-STELLATE NEURONS PROVIDE THE ONLY DIRECT PROJECTION FROM THE ANTEROVENTRAL COCHLEAR NUCLEUS (AVCN) TO THE IC AND HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE PROCESSING OF VOCALIZATION CUES SINCE THEY ENCODE INFORMATION ABOUT SOUND FREQUENCY AND AMPLITUDE MODULATIONS (AM). HOWEVER, HOW T- STELLATE CELLS INFLUENCE SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF IC NEURONS AND HOW THEY SHAPE SPEECH AND VOCALIZATION CODING IN THE IC IS UNKNOWN. ONE BARRIER TO STUDYING T-STELLATE INPUT TO THE IC HAS BEEN A LACK OF MOLECULAR MARKERS FOR IC NEURON CLASSES. RECENTLY, WE OVERCAME THIS BARRIER BY IDENTIFYING TWO NOVEL CLASSES OF IC NEURONS: GLUTAMATERGIC VIP NEURONS AND GABAERGIC NPY NEURONS. TOGETHER, VIP AND NPY NEURONS REPRESENT ~55-75% OF STELLATE CELLS WITHIN THE CENTRAL NUCLEUS OF THE IC. USING CHANNELRHODOPSIN ASSISTED CIRCUIT MAPPING AND FLUORESCENCE-TARGETED WHOLE CELL RECORDINGS IN BRAIN SLICES, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT BOTH VIP AND NPY NEURONS RECEIVE FUNCTIONAL SYNAPTIC INPUT FROM T-STELLATE CELLS. INTERESTINGLY, THE EXCITATORY POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS (EPSPS) EVOKED BY T-STELLATE INPUT TO NPY NEURONS ARE LARGER IN AMPLITUDE THAN THOSE EVOKED IN VIP NEURONS. IN ADDITION, OPTOGENETIC ACTIVATION OF T-STELLATE TERMINALS CAN ELICIT FEEDFORWARD INHIBITION IN BOTH NPY AND VIP NEURONS, SUGGESTING THAT T-STELLATE AFFERENTS CAN RECRUIT LOCAL INHIBITORY CIRCUITS IN THE IC. TO INVESTIGATE HOW T-STELLATE CELLS INFLUENCE FREQUENCY TUNING AND AM SELECTIVITY IN THE IC, WE WILL MAKE IN-VIVO SINGLE-UNIT RECORDINGS FROM IC NEURONS BEFORE AND AFTER SILENCING T-STELLATE INPUTS USING CHEMOGENETICS WITH THE INHIBITORY RECEPTOR HM4DI.

THE OVERALL OB- JECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE HOW NMDA RECEPTORS (NMDARS) CONTRIBUTE TO THE TRANSITION FROM TEM- PORAL TO RATE CODES IN THE IC. NMDARS ARE GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS THAT ARE PROMINENTLY EXPRESSED IN THE IC AND THAT PROLONG THE TIME WINDOW FOR SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION DUE TO THEIR SLOW KINETICS COMPARED TO AMPA RECEPTORS.

OUR PRELIMINARY DATA PROVIDE THE FIRST MOLECULAR MECHANISM FOR THIS PHENOMENON, SHOWING THAT MANY IC NEURONS EXPRESS NR2C OR NR2D SUBUNITS, NMDAR SUBUNITS WHICH CONFER DECREASED SENSITIVITY TO MG2+ BLOCK AND ENABLE NMDARS TO ACTIVATE AT RESTING MEMBRANE POTENTIAL.

ARTICULATION AND PROSODY ARE CRUCIAL FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, YET COMMONLY IMPAIRED IN COMMUNICATION DISORDERS. THEY ALSO DIFFER IN IMPORTANT WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, ALTERING A SINGLE ARTICULATORY FEATURE LIKE THE FIRST VOWEL FORMANT (F1) ELICITS A RESPONSE IN ONLY THAT FEATURE, BUT ALTERING A SINGLE PROSODIC FEATURE LIKE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY (FO) CAN ELICIT A RESPONSE IN OTHER PROSODIC CUES. PROSODIC CUES LIKE FO, SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL, AND RATE CAN BE TRADED TO REACH THE PROSODIC TARGET, BUT SUCH FLEXIBILITY IS LESS AVAILABLE FOR PRODUCING ARTICULATORY FEATURES.

THE PROPOSED AIMS TEST SPECIFIC HYPOTHESES REGARDING GENETIC CONSTRAINTS ON AUDITORY CODING IN SONGBIRDS, AN ANIMAL MODEL OF SPEECH PROCESSING. LIKE HUMANS AND UNLIKE OTHER ANIMALS, SONGBIRDS LEARN TO SING BY LEARNING REGULARITIES IN THE VOCAL SOUNDS OF ADULTS THEY INTERACT WITH SOCIALLY, AND AUDITORY CORTICAL CODING IS PERMANENTLY ALTERED BY EXPERIENCE. THE SONGBIRD SECONDARY AUDITORY CORTEX, CAUDOMEDIAL NIDOPALLIUM (NCM) IS REQUIRED FOR VOCAL LEARNING, AND CONTAINS NEURONS THAT ARE SELECTIVELY TUNED FOR ACOUSTICS OF SONGS HEARD IN EARLY LIFE.

IN CONTRAST, HYBRID BIRDS BORN OF MIXED-SPECIES PARENTS COPY BOTH THE MORPHOLOGY AND TEMPORAL STRUCTURE OF THEIR FATHER\u2019S SONG, DESPITE HAVING ONLY HALF THE GENETIC MAKEUP.

TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES FOR EARLY INTERVENTION, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO FIRST UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING WORD LEARNING IN THIS HIGHLY HETEROGENOUS POPULATION. BASED ON PREVIOUS WORK, ONE MECHANISM AVAILABLE TO OLDER AUTISTIC CHILDREN IS CROSS-SITUATIONAL LEARNING (CSL). HOWEVER, THE HIGHER PREVALENCE OF WORD-LEARNING DIFFICULTIES IN ASD SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY OF REMAINING UNKNOWN FACTORS LIMITING CHILDREN\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE EFFICIENT USE OF CSL IN REAL-WORLD LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENTS. ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT AUTISTIC CHILDREN DEMONSTRATE DELAYS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF CSL WITH CASCADING CONSEQUENCES FOR WORD LEARNING.

EMPLOYING A LOOKING-WHILE-LISTENING EYE-TRACKING PARADIGM, SPECIFIC AIM 1 (STUDY 1) OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE CSL IN A YOUNGER GROUP OF CHILDREN (2- TO 4-YEARS OLD). A SECOND POSSIBILITY IS THAT PRIOR CSL STUDIES HAVE NOT REFLECTED THE CHALLENGES OF CHILDREN\u2019S NATURAL LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENTS. PREVIOUS STUDIES REQUIRED CHILDREN TO ASSOCIATE ONLY ONE EXEMPLAR IMAGE WITH EACH LABEL, WHEREAS IN REAL-WORLD LEARNING SITUATIONS CHILDREN ENCOUNTER MANY DIFFERENT OBJECTS THAT ARE ALL GIVEN THE SAME LABEL. TO SUPPORT WORD LEARNING IN THESE CONTEXTS, NEUROTYPICAL (NT) CHILDREN TEND TO CATEGORIZE OBJECTS BASED ON SHAPE (KNOWN AS THE SHAPE BIAS). PRESCHOOL- AND SCHOOL-AGE AUTISTIC CHILDREN DO NOT SHARE THIS TENDENCY WITH NT PEERS.

A FEW PRELIMINARY STUDIES INDICATE THAT THERE ARE MOTOR-BASED BRAIN DIFFERENCES RELATED TO SPEECH PRODUCTION AND LANGUAGE IN AUTISM. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE MOTOR ACT OF SPEECH PRODUCTION MAY PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES OBSERVED IN AUTISM, HOWEVER THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIORAL BASES OF SPEECH MOTOR PROFILES ARE CURRENTLY POORLY CHARACTERIZED. WE CAN ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING SPEECH PRODUCTION MOTOR DIFFERENCES, AND RELATED FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES, IN AUTISTIC INDIVIDUALS THROUGH AN IMPROVED CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPEECH MOTOR SYSTEM AND SPEECH AND LANGUAGE BEHAVIORS. HERE, I PROPOSE TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SPEECH-MOTOR BRAIN REGIONS ARE LESS ENGAGED DURING SPEECH PRODUCTION TASKS IN AUTISTIC COMPARED TO NEUROTYPICAL (NT) ADULTS, AND THAT THIS DISENGAGEMENT IS RELATED TO OVERALL MOTOR, SPEECH, AND LANGUAGE SKILLS. I WILL RECRUIT 30 NT ADULTS AND 45 AUTISTIC ADULTS WITH DIVERSE LANGUAGE PROFILES FOR AN FMRI STUDY PAIRED WITH DEEP SPEECH BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPING. IN AIM 1, I WILL USE A NOVEL FUNCTIONAL LOCALIZER TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE THE SPEECH PRODUCTION NETWORK IN EACH INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT AND COMPARE THE NETWORKS ACROSS GROUPS. IN AIM 2, I WILL USE THESE INDIVIDUAL NETWORKS AS REGIONS OF INTEREST IN WHICH TO EXAMINE BRAIN ACTIVATION DURING A LANGUAGE- RELEVANT SPEECH PRODUCTION TASK, NONWORD REPETITION. AS PART OF AIM 2, I WILL CONDUCT DEEP SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PHENOTYPING OF THE AUTISTIC ADULTS, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN COMPREHENSIVE PROFILES OF THEIR COMMUNICATION SKILLS. I WILL THEN EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SPEECH PRODUCTION ACTIVATION DURING NONWORD REPETITION AND EACH PARTICIPANT\u2019S SPEECH, LANGUAGE, AND MOTOR PROFILES. THESE AIMS WILL PRODUCE A NOVEL LOCALIZER TO CHARACTERIZE THE SPEECH PRODUCTION REGIONS, ELUCIDATE SPEECH-MOTOR BRAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NT AND AUTISTIC ADULTS, AND PROVIDE KEY INSIGHTS INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPEECH PRODUCTION RELATED MOTOR REGIONS AND COMMUNICATION IN AUTISM.

HOWEVER, ULTRASOUND IMAGING CAN BE DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET FOR CLINICIANS AND INDIVIDUALS, LIMITING THE UNDERSTANDING OF ARTICULATORY DATA AND ULTRASOUND BIOFEEDBACK THERAPY SPEECH OUTCOMES. A LIKELY SOURCE OF DIFFICULTY IS THE ARTICULATORY INFORMATION MISSING FROM ULTRASOUND IMAGES, SUCH AS THE TONGUE TIP AND REFERENCE VOCAL TRACT STRUCTURES (E.G., PALATE) THAT CANNOT BE CONSISTENTLY IMAGED WITH ULTRASOUND DUE TO AIR.  MUCH OF THIS MISSING INFORMATION FROM ULTRASOUND CAN BE ASCERTAINED IN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) BECAUSE MRI IMAGES THE ENTIRE VOCAL TRACT. COMPARING ULTRASOUND IMAGES AND MRI WILL IMPROVE INTERPRETATION OF ULTRASOUND IMAGES BY CONFIRMING THAT CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF ULTRASOUND IMAGES (E.G., OBSCURED TONGUE TIP, DOUBLE EDGE ARTIFACTS) OCCUR FROM CHARACTERISTICS OF TONGUE SHAPES; AS WELL, MODELS CAN BE TRAINED TO PREDICT FROM ULTRASOUND IMAGES THE ARTICULATORY INFORMATION SHOWN IN MRI. HOWEVER, ARTICULATORY VARIABILITY PREVENTS DIRECT COMPARISON BETWEEN THESE IMAGES. A NOVEL APPROACH TO AVOID VARIABILITY IS TO SIMULATE ULTRASOUND WAVE PROPAGATION IN TISSUE SEGMENTED FROM MRI.

IMPORTANTLY, THE ONLY OFF-TARGET RTK INHIBITED BY ALL THREE DRUGS IS C-KIT, WHICH WE FIND IN OUR SCRNASEQ DATA TO BE MOST HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN SWEET-SENSING TYPE II TRCS. THESE DATA STRONGLY IMPLICATE C-KIT IN SWEET CELL HOMEOSTASIS. FURTHER ANALYSIS OF OUR SCRNASEQ DATA REVEALS THAT C-KIT'S LIGAND - STEM CELL FACTOR (SCF), IS EXPRESSED BY TYPE I AND TYPE III TRCS, RAISING THE POSSIBILITY OF C-KIT MEDIATED CROSSTALK WITHIN TASTE BUDS. THESE DATA IN SUM LEAD ME TO MY HYPOTHESIS THAT C-KIT SIGNALING, STIMULATED BY CROSSTALK WITH OTHER TRC TYPES, IS NECESSARY FOR THE DIFFERENTIATION AND/OR SURVIVAL OF SWEET-SENSING TYPE II TRCS. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, MY FIRST AIM IS TO DETERMINE IF C-KIT INHIBITION BY TKI TREATMENT LEADS TO DEFICITS IN SWEET TASTE IN VIVO BY TREATING MICE WITH AXITINIB AND PERFORMING BEHAVIORAL, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND CELLULAR ASSAYS. MY SECOND AIM IS TO DETERMINE IF C-KIT IS NECESSARY FOR SWEET CELL DIFFERENTIATION OR SURVIVAL. I WILL USE TWO GENETIC C-KIT KNOCKOUT MODELS UNDER DIFFERENT CRE DRIVERS TO KNOCK OUT C-KIT EXPRESSION AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TRC DIFFERENTIATION. LASTLY, I WILL INVESTIGATE C-KIT MEDIATED CROSSTALK BY GENETICALLY KNOCKING OUT SCF FROM WITHIN TASTE BUDS.

ONE POTENTIAL STRATEGY TO REGENERATE HAIR CELLS AND RESTORE HEARING IS TO INDUCE THE TRANSDIFFERENTIATION OF SURROUNDING SUPPORTING CELLS INTO NEW FUNCTIONAL HAIR CELLS. THIS IS BASED ON THE OBSERVATION THAT NON-MAMMALIAN VERTEBRATES SUCH AS ZEBRAFISH CAN REPLENISH SENSORY HAIR CELLS THROUGHOUT LIFE FROM THESE NEIGHBORING SUPPORTING CELLS. HOWEVER, THE FACT THAT MATURE MAMMALIAN SUPPORTING CELLS LOSE THE ABILITY TO TRANSDIFFERENTIATE INTO HAIR CELLS POSES A GREAT CHALLENGE TO IMPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY IN THE CLINICS TO RESTORE HEARING IN PATIENTS. OUR LAB RECENTLY IDENTIFIED AN EPIGENETIC MECHANISM THAT RESTRICTS MOUSE SUPPORTING CELL PLASTICITY BY PERMANENT CLOSING OF CHROMATIN AROUND ENHANCERS DRIVING EXPRESSION OF HAIR CELL GENES, INCLUDING CRITICAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS SUCH AS ATOH1 AND POU4F3. ATOH1 IS A MASTER REGULATOR THAT DRIVES THE DIFFERENTIATION OF HAIR CELLS ACROSS VERTEBRATES, WITH THE INABILITY TO UPREGULATE ATOH1 EXPRESSION IN POSTNATAL MOUSE SUPPORTING CELLS BEING A KEY BARRIER TO HAIR CELL REGENERATION FOLLOWING INJURY. IN THIS PROPOSAL, I INVESTIGATE HOW THE HIGHLY REGENERATIVE ZEBRAFISH MAY ESCAPE SUCH EPIGENETIC REPRESSION BY EXAMINING CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY NEAR ZEBRAFISH HAIR CELL GENES. MY PRELIMINARY SINGLE-NUCLEI ATAC SEQUENCING DATA REVEAL THAT SEVERAL POTENTIAL REGULATORY ELEMENTS OF ZEBRAFISH ATOH1A REMAIN ACCESSIBLE IN SUPPORTING CELLS. THIS IS IN CONTRAST WITH WHAT WE OBSERVE AT THE MOUSE ATOH1 LOCUS. INTERESTINGLY, THIS MAINTENANCE OF CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY IS SPECIFIC TO THE ATOH1A LOCUS, AS POU4F3 AND OTHER HAIR CELL GENES DO NOT RETAIN CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY IN ZEBRAFISH SUPPORTING CELLS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE ATOH1A LOCUS, RATHER THAN GENERAL CHROMATIN MODIFYING ENZYMES, MAY ACCOUNT FOR THIS MAINTENANCE OF ACCESSIBILITY IN ZEBRAFISH SUPPORTING CELLS. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF THE ZEBRAFISH ATOH1A LOCUS MAINTAIN ACCESSIBILITY OF ITS CIS-REGULATORY ELEMENTS, WHICH FACILITATE ITS UPREGULATION DURING HAIR CELL REGENERATION. IN AIM 1, I TEST WHETHER SEQUENCE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ZEBRAFISH AND MOUSE ATOH1A/ATOH1 LOCI ACCOUNT FOR THE FISH-SPECIFIC ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OPEN CHROMATIN. IN AIM 2, I TEST A CLASS OF ATOH1A ENHANCERS THAT REMAIN ACCESSIBLE IN SUPPORTING CELLS FOR THEIR REQUIREMENT FOR CONTINUED HAIR CELL GENERATION. I ALSO TEST THE ROLE OF A SECOND CLASS OF SUPPORTING CELL-SPECIFIC ATOH1A ELEMENTS IN PREVENTING ECTOPIC HAIR CELL FORMATION FROM SUPPORTING CELLS IN THE ABSENCE OF INJURY.

TASTE PERCEPTION GUIDES APPROPRIATE FOOD CHOICES. WHILE ANIMALS DISPLAY INNATE PREFERENCES FOR SWEET TASTES ASSOCIATED WITH CALORICALLY DENSE FOODS, NEW LEARNED ASSOCIATIONS CAN REVERSE THESE PREFERENCES TO PROTECT AGAINST CONSUMPTION OF POTENTIALLY TOXIC OR HARMFUL FOODS. FOR EXAMPLE, CTA OCCURS WHEN VISCERAL ILLNESS (UNCONDITIONED STIMULUS, US) FOLLOWS CONSUMPTION OF A NOVEL TASTE (CONDITIONED STIMULUS, CS), WHICH LEADS TO A ROBUST AND LONG-LASTING AVOIDANCE OF THE CS, EVEN AFTER ONLY A SINGLE TASTE-ILLNESS (CS-US) PAIRING. HOWEVER, THE NEURAL CIRCUIT MECHANISMS UNDERLYING CTA REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. PRIOR WORK HAS IMPLICATED THE INSULAR CORTEX (INSCTX), WHICH ENCOMPASSES PRIMARY GUSTATORY AND VISCERAL CORTEX, AND THE BRAINSTEM LATERAL PARABRACHIAL NUCLEUS (LPBN), WHICH INTEGRATES MULTIMODAL SENSORY INPUT FROM THE BODY, AS KEY BRAIN REGIONS FOR THE LEARNING AND RETRIEVAL OF CTA IN RODENTS. IT WAS LONG KNOWN THAT LPBN NEURONS RESPOND TO AND ARE NECESSARY FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF VISCERAL MALAISE SIGNALS DURING ACQUISITION OF CTA. IN ADDITION, RECENT WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT A SPECIFIC POPULATION OF LPBN NEURONS, THOSE EXPRESSING CALCITONIN GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE (CGRP), DEVELOP LEARNED RESPONSES TO THE CS AFTER CTA AND ARE NECESSARY FOR CTA RETRIEVAL. LIKEWISE, INSCTX CONTAINS REPRESENTATIONS OF BOTH TASTE AND MALAISE, AND ITS CS-EVOKED POPULATION ACTIVITY SHIFTS AFTER CTA, LEADING TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A FUNCTIONAL INTERACTION BETWEEN INSCTX AND LPBN MAY DRIVE THE NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE TO CTA. INDEED, INSCTX SENDS A DENSE EXCITATORY PROJECTION TO LPBN (INSCTXLPBN), THE FUNCTION OF WHICH IS ENTIRELY UNKNOWN. I WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT UPON RE-EXPOSURE TO THE CS DURING CTA EXPRESSION, INSCTXLPBN NEURONS DRIVE ACTIVITY PATTERNS IN LPBN THAT SIMULATE AND REINSTATE FEELINGS OF MALAISE, LEADING TO AVOIDANCE OF THE CS.

MY PROPOSAL WILL FILL A GAP IN NEURAL STUDIES OF TIMBRE BY TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CAPTURE AND OFF-CF INHIBITORY MECHANISMS LEAD TO ROBUST REPRESENTATIONS OF SUPRATHRESHOLD SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL-INSTRUMENT TIMBRE IN THE MIDBRAIN. TO TEST MY HYPOTHESIS, I WILL RECORD SINGLE-UNIT INFERIOR COLLICULUS (IC) RESPONSES FROM AWAKE DUTCH-BELTED RABBITS. I WILL ALSO DEVELOP A NEW COMPUTATIONAL IC MODEL BASED ON THESE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES.  SPECTRAL ENVELOPES OF HARMONIC SOUNDS ARE CORRELATED WITH THE TIMBRAL PERCEPTION OF \u201cBRIGHTNESS\u201d.

THE FIRST MECHANISM, CAPTURE, REFERS TO THE DOMINANCE OF HARMONICS NEAR SPECTRAL PEAKS OVER AUDITORY-NERVE FIBERS TUNED NEAR THE PEAKS. CAPTURE IS DUE TO SATURATION OF INNER HAIR CELLS. CAPTURE BY A SINGLE HARMONIC REDUCES THE AMPLITUDE OF LOW-FREQUENCY NEURAL FLUCTUATIONS IN AUDITORY-NERVE FIBERS. RATES OF IC NEURONS ARE SENSITIVE TO LOW-FREQUENCY NEURAL FLUCTUATIONS AS CHARACTERIZED BY MODULATION TRANSFER FUNCTIONS. ULTIMATELY, CAPTURE OF AUDITORY-NERVE RESPONSES FOR FIBERS TUNED NEAR SPECTRAL PEAKS RESULTS IN IC RATE PROFILES THAT ENCODE SPECTRAL PEAKS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS ARE PARTIALLY CONSISTENT WITH SPECTRAL PEAKS OF SYNTHETIC TIMBRE STIMULI CAPTURING PERIPHERAL RESPONSES, LEADING TO A RATE REPRESENTATION OF SALIENT SPECTRAL FEATURES IN THE MIDBRAIN.

A SUBCORTICAL COMPUTATIONAL MODEL THAT FEATURES CAPTURE, BUT NOT OFF-CF INHIBITION, WAS ABLE TO PREDICT PRELIMINARY RESPONSES TO SYNTHETIC TIMBRE AND NARROWBAND TONE-IN-NOISE, BUT COULD NOT PREDICT RESPONSES TO WIDEBAND TONE-IN-NOISE OR NATURAL TIMBRE, INDICATING THE NEED TO UPDATE THE MODEL.

DLD IS A PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WITH CHILDHOOD ONSET THAT CAN PERSIST INTO ADULTHOOD AND AFFECT PSYCHOSOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND SOCIOECONOMIC OUTCOMES, YET LITTLE IS UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE BRAIN CORRELATES OF DLD.

THEREFORE, THE RESEARCH PROPOSED HERE ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL NEED TO BETTER CHARACTERIZE THE UNDERLYING NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT IN CHILDREN WITH DLD. IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE NIDCD\u2019S MISSION, THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO IDENTIFY BIOMARKERS OF DLD THAT CAN INFORM DEVELOPMENT OF TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH DLD.

CRUCIALLY, STUDIES OF LIMB SENSORIMOTOR CONTROL ALSO SUGGEST THAT WORSE SENSORY ACUITY REDUCES ADAPTATION. THUS, WE PROPOSE THAT PERILARYNGEAL CO-CONTRACTION MAY OCCUR IN RESPONSE TO AUDITORY FEEDBACK PERTURBATIONS IN ORDER TO STABILIZE THE LARYNX, AND WILL DECREASE WITH ADAPTIVE VOCAL LEARNING. FURTHERMORE, IMPAIRED AUDITORY ACUITY IN SOME SPEAKERS WITH HVDS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH ATYPICAL ADAPTIVE VOCAL LEARNING AND PERSISTENT PERILARYNGEAL CO- CONTRACTION COMPARED TO SPEAKERS WITHOUT HVDS. THEREFORE, AIM 1 WILL COMPARE ADAPTIVE VOCAL LEARNING AND PERILARYNGEAL CO-CONTRACTION IN RESPONSE TO PERTURBATIONS OF FO AND INTENSITY OF AUDITORY FEEDBACK IN INDIVIDUALS WITH (N = 26) AND WITHOUT (N = 26) HVDS. AIM 2 WILL EVALUATE THE PREVALENCE OF ATYPICAL AUDITORY ACUITY FOR VOCAL FO AND INTENSITY IN THE SAME GROUPS OF SPEAKERS.

THEREFORE, LEARNING TO PRODUCE NEW SOUND SEQUENCES (SUCH AS THOSE IN A DIFFICULT WORD) IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF SPEECH REHABILITATION. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING SPEECH MOTOR SEQUENCE LEARNING ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD DESPITE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROCESS TO SPEECH THERAPY. ACCURATE SPEECH PRODUCTION INVOLVES BOTH A PHONOLOGICAL ENCODING STAGE TO PLAN AND SEQUENCE UPCOMING SOUND UNITS (I.E., PHONEMES) AND A MOTOR PROGRAMMING STAGE TO TRANSFORM THE PLANNED PHONEMES INTO PRECISE MOTOR MOVEMENTS. IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW THESE TWO STAGES INTERACT TO SUPPORT THE LEARNING OF NEW SPEECH SEQUENCES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DIFFERENTIATE THE ROLES OF PHONOLOGICAL PLANNING AND SPEECH MOTOR PROGRAMMING PROCESSES DURING SPEECH MOTOR SEQUENCE LEARNING IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE APHASIA (PPA). PPA IS A CATEGORY OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE IN WHICH THE LOCATION AND DEGREE OF BRAIN ATROPHY IS CLOSELY TIED TO SPECIFIC SPEECH-LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENTS IN EACH INDIVIDUAL, AND THUS ALLOWS FOR RELATIVELY PRECISE LOCALIZATION OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE FUNCTION. PATIENTS WITH PPA MAY HAVE ISOLATED PHONOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT (E.G., LOGOPENIC-VARIANT PPA) OR MOTOR PROGRAMMING IMPAIRMENT (E.G., PROGRESSIVE APRAXIA OF SPEECH), OR MAY HAVE RELATIVELY INTACT SPEECH. IN THIS PROJECT, PARTICIPANTS WILL COMPLETE A TWO-DAY LEARNING PARADIGM WHERE THEY WILL PRACTICE NOVEL SYLLABLES CONTAINING NON-NATIVE CONSONANT CLUSTERS THAT DO NOT OCCUR IN ENGLISH. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCURACY AND SPEED OF PRACTICED CONSONANT CLUSTERS WILL BE COMPARED TO THEIR PERFORMANCE ON SYLLABLES CONTAINING UNTRAINED NON-NATIVE CONSONANT CLUSTERS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS, BASED ON THE GODIVA MODEL OF SPEECH SEQUENCING, IS THAT PHONOLOGICAL LEARNING SHOULD RESULT IN REDUCED UTTERANCE DURATION WHILE MOTOR PROGRAM LEARNING SHOULD RESULT IN IMPROVED ACCURACY. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS THROUGH TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DETERMINE THE BEHAVIORAL PREDICTORS OF SPEECH MOTOR SEQUENCE LEARNING ABILITIES, AND 2) ESTABLISH THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF THESE ABILITIES.

VARIANTS OF OVER 100 HUMAN GENES HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DEAFNESS, MANY OF WHICH ALTER THE STRUCTURE OF THE SENSORY ORGANELLE IN HAIR CELLS, CALLED THE HAIR BUNDLE. THE HAIR BUNDLE CONSISTS OF ORGANIZED ROWS OF GRADED-HEIGHT MEMBRANE PROTRUSIONS, OR STEREOCILIA, ON THE SURFACE OF HAIR CELLS. HAIR BUNDLE FORMATION DURING DEVELOPMENT AND ITS PRECISE ARCHITECTURE DURING LIFE ARE VULNERABLE TO A VARIETY OF GENETIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND AGE-RELATED INSULTS, ALL OF WHICH RESULT IN THE DECLINE OR COMPLETE LOSS OF HEARING ABILITY. MY OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO CHARACTERIZE PROTEIN INTERACTIONS THAT ARE VITAL TO THE HAIR BUNDLE\u2019S DEVELOPMENT AND LIFELONG MAINTENANCE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, I IDENTIFY A NEW ROLE FOR A CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN ENRICHED IN THE MOUSE HAIR BUNDLE, SPECIFICALLY, AT THE TIP OF THE TALLEST STEREOCILIA. A GROUP OF FIVE PROTEINS, REFERRED TO AS THE ELONGATION COMPLEX, WAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AT THIS SAME COMPARTMENT. LOSS OF ANY MEMBER OF THIS COMPLEX PREVENTS PROPER STEREOCILIA ELONGATION, BLURS THE DISTINCT IDENTITY OF STEREOCILIA ACROSS ROWS, AND RESULTS IN PROFOUND DEAFNESS IN BOTH HUMANS AND MICE. INTERESTINGLY, SIMILAR DEFECTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN MOUSE MUTANTS LACKING KEY COMPONENTS OF THE MECHANOELECTRICAL TRANSDUCTION CHANNEL. THIS SUGGESTS THAT, VIA TRANSDUCTION, ACTIVE HAIR BUNDLES SOMEHOW INFLUENCE ELONGATION FACTORS, AND THUS STEREOCILIA DIMENSIONS.

I PROPOSE TO TAKE A NOVEL, REDUCTIONIST APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM BY LEVERAGING THE EXPERIMENTAL ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LARVAL DROSOPHILA BRAIN TO DISSECT THE CIRCUIT BASIS FOR IHI IN THE CONTEXT OF OLFACTORY SENSORY PROCESSING. THE DROSOPHILA LARVA IS THE IDEAL SYSTEM IN WHICH TO APPROACH THIS PROBLEM OWING TO THE SMALL SIZE OF ITS BRAIN (JUST ~10,000 NEURONS), THE OPTICAL TRANSPARENCY OF ITS BODY, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NUMEROUS GENETIC TOOLS FOR MANIPULATING INDIVIDUAL CELLS AND CELL TYPES.

ONE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE PERSISTENCE OF SOCIAL ANXIETY THAT HAS YET TO BE EXAMINED AMONG ADULTS WHO STUTTER IS POST-EVENT PROCESSING, A COGNITIVE PROCESS DEFINED BY EXCESSIVE AND INTRUSIVE SELF-CRITICISM FOLLOWING A STRESSFUL COMMUNICATION EVENT. DISTINCT FROM REPETITIVE NEGATIVE THINKING, WHICH IS ONE\u2019S GENERAL TENDENCY TO RUMINATE AND COULD APPLY TO A VARIETY OF ISSUES UNRELATED TO COMMUNICATION, POST-EVENT PROCESSING SPECIFICALLY OCCURS FOLLOWING A COMMUNICATION EXCHANGE AND IS LINKED TO ANTICIPATORY ANXIETY AND AVOIDANCE OF SUBSEQUENT COMMUNICATION SITUATIONS.

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IDENTIFY HOW THE BODY COORDINATES DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO MAINTAIN STABILITY WHILE WALKING AND HOW THAT COORDINATION OF STRATEGIES IS AFFECTED BY VESTIBULAR DISORDERS.  EXISTING LITERATURE HAS IDENTIFIED FOUR MAJOR STABILIZATION STRATEGIES USED IN HUMAN WALKING: 1) REGULATING FOOT PLACEMENT, 2) GENERATING ANKLE INVERSION/EVERSION TORQUE TO ALTER THE LATERAL TRAJECTORY OF THE BODY, 3) ADJUSTING PUSH-OFF FORCE AT THE ANKLE, AND 4) MODIFYING TRUNK POSTURE. WHILE THESE STRATEGIES ARE ACTIVELY COORDINATED TO RETAIN OVERALL STABILITY, THEY HAVE NOT YET ALL BEEN CONSIDERED SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL INVESTIGATE THE INTERACTION AMONG ALL FOUR MAJOR STABILIZATION STRATEGIES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES.  A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF HUMAN LOCOMOTION STABILITY WILL BE DEVELOPED AND A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WILL BE PERFORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF EACH STABILIZATION STRATEGY AND THE IMPACT OF VESTIBULAR INPUTS ON OVERALL STABILITY (AIM 1).

(AIM 1A) WE WILL THEN UTILIZE THE AUXIN-INDUCIBLE DEGRADATION (AID) SYSTEM TO DEGRADE ENDOGENOUS OSM-9 AND ASK IN WHAT NEURONS AND AT WHAT STAGES OSM-9 EXPRESSION IS FUNCTIONAL FOR ADAPTATION. (AIM 1B AND 1C) TO FURTHER STUDY IF OSM-9 PRODUCES AN ACTIVATING OR ATTENUATING RESPONSE IN THE OLFACTORY CIRCUIT AFTER LEARNING AND MEMORY, WE WILL FIRST ASK HOW PATTERNS OF CA2+ ACTIVITY EVOLVE IN THE KNOWN OLFACTORY CIRCUIT IN RESPONSE TO ODOR AFTER LEARNING AND 16-HR RECOVERY.

ISOCALORIC FEEDING IN WHICH A FAT-FED MOUSE CONSUMED THE SAME NUMBER OF CALORIES AS A CONTROL-FED MOUSE, BUT OF FATTY CHOW, PREVENTED OBESITY BUT DID NOT PREVENT THE NEURONAL LOSS. IT APPEARS THAT THE CONSUMPTION OF FAT IN THE DIET INDUCES THE OBSERVED OLFACTORY CHANGES, NOT EXCESS ADIPOSITY OR OVERCONSUMPTION. THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN FAT CONSUMPTION AND OLFACTORY ANATOMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLORED. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UNCOVER THE MECHANISTIC LINK BETWEEN FATTY DIET CONSUMPTION AND OLFACTORY CHANGES. A FATTY DIET IS KNOWN TO MODIFY GUT MICROBIOME COMPOSITION, OFTEN INCREASING FIRMICUTES AND PROTEOBACTERIA, AND DECREASING BACTEROIDETES. THE GUT MICROBIOME INFLUENCES INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL STRUCTURE, AND A HIGH-FAT DIET COMPROMISES INTESTINAL BARRIER FUNCTION BY REDUCING TIGHT JUNCTION INTEGRITY. THIS ALLOWS FOR MOLECULES TO LEAK OUT OF THE GUT AND CAN RESULT IN AN ELEVATION OF CIRCULATING LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDES (LPS). THIS CONDITION IS CALLED METABOLIC ENDOTOXEMIA AND IS OBSERVED IN FAT-FED MICE. LPS IS A COMPONENT OF THE OUTER MEMBRANE OF GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA. LPS IS A LIGAND FOR THE TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 4, AND ACTIVATES IMMUNE CELLS, INDUCES INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE RELEASE, AND IS USED EXPERIMENTALLY TO INDUCE SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION. LPS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INDUCE NEURODEGENERATION, NEUROINFLAMMATORY NF-B SIGNALING, AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO PROBE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN A FATTY DIET, GUT MICROBIOME CHANGES, CIRCULATING LPS, NEUROINFLAMMATION, AND OLFACTORY CHANGES THROUGH A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE FATTY DIET INDUCES CHANGES IN THE GUT MICROBIOME THAT COMPROMISE INTESTINAL INTEGRITY, LEADING TO ELEVATED LEVELS OF CIRCULATING LPS, WHICH CAUSES CHRONIC NEUROINFLAMMATION AND THE SUBSEQUENT ANATOMICAL AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES OF THE OLFACTORY SYSTEM. FIRST, CIRCULATING LEVELS OF LPS WILL BE MEASURED IN AD LIBITUM FAT- AND ISOCALORICALLY FAT-FED MICE TO DETERMINE IF THEY EXHIBIT METABOLIC ENDOTOXEMIA.

CHILDREN WITH DLD MAY EXPERIENCE LIFELONG DIFFICULTIES WITH LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION AND USE ACROSS CONTEXTS, SUCH AS SOCIAL COMMUNICATION OR ACADEMICS (BISHOP ET AL., 2017). EARLY LANGUAGE WEAKNESSES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES LATER IN LIFE (CONTI-RAMSDEN ET AL., 2018; ST CLAIR ET AL., 2011), AS WELL AS INCREASED RISK OF CONDUCT PROBLEMS (YEW & O'KEARNEY, 2013).

FOR BILINGUALS IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF ACQUIRING ENGLISH, ASSESSING IN CHILDREN\u2019S FIRST LANGUAGE (L1) IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF THEIR TRUE ABILITY. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT IN CHILDREN\u2019S L1 IS VITAL FOR ACCURATE AND EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF DLD, WHICH WILL LEAD TO TIMELY INTERVENTION WHEN NEEDED AND BETTER LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. A LARGE CHALLENGE TO ASSESSING IN CHILDREN\u2019S L1 IS THE SHORTAGE OF BILINGUAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. LESS THAN 6% OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS (SLPS) ARE BILINGUAL, AND VERY FEW SPEAK VIETNAMESE. FURTHERMORE, BILINGUAL SLPS ARE OFTEN NOT LOCATED IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREA AS THE CHILDREN IN NEED OF ASSESSMENT.

INNER EAR SENSORY ORGANS CONTAIN MECHANOSENSITIVE HAIR CELLS REQUIRED FOR HEARING AND BALANCE. HAIR CELLS ARE KILLED BY DAMAGE FROM LOUD NOISES AND CERTAIN OTOTOXIC DRUGS. THE MAMMALIAN INNER EAR HAS MINIMAL REGENERATIVE CAPACITY FOR FORMING NEW HAIR CELLS, SO WHEN DAMAGE OCCURS IT CAN CAUSE PERMANENT HEARING LOSS. BEYOND DAMAGE, THERE ARE A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE MECHANISMS RESULTING IN REDUCED HEARING, BALANCE ISSUES, OR DEAFNESS OCCURRING IN THE GLOBAL POPULATION. UNDERSTANDING HOW THE INNER EAR DEVELOPS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE FAILURE OF HAIR CELL REGENERATION IN MAMMALS AND MAY REVEAL STRATEGIES TO RESTORE HEARING IN HUMANS. THE NOTCH SIGNALING PATHWAY AND SPECIFICALLY THE PLURIPOTENCY FACTOR SOX2 PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN INNER EAR DEVELOPMENT. SOX2, AS A NOTCH DOWNSTREAM TARGET, IS EXPRESSED BROADLY DURING EARLY INNER EAR DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, AS THE EAR CONTINUES TO DEVELOP, SOX2 EXPRESSION BECOMES RESTRICTED TO PROSENSORY DOMAINS, REGIONS OF THE INNER EAR THAT WILL LATER DEVELOP INTO AUDITORY OR VESTIBULAR SENSORY ORGANS. THE REST OF THE EMBRYONIC INNER EAR WILL FORM NONSENSORY STRUCTURES SUCH AS THE SEMICIRCULAR CANALS. DATA FROM OUR LAB SUGGESTS THAT SOX2 EXPRESSION IS PRESENT IN BOTH PROSENSORY AND NONSENSORY PROGENITORS DURING EARLY INNER EAR DEVELOPMENT BUT BECOME RESTRICTED TO PROSENSORY REGIONS OVER TIME. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF SOX2 DURING EARLY INNER EAR DEVELOPMENT. TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT THE DEVELOPMENTAL POTENTIAL OF SOX2-EXPRESSING PROGENITOR CELLS CHANGES OVER TIME, WE WILL USE A CELL LINEAGE TRACING METHOD TO TEST WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL SOX2- EXPRESSING CELL IS CAPABLE OF GENERATING PROSENSORY OR NONSENSORY CELLS, OR BOTH. IN PARALLEL, WE WILL TEST WHETHER TRANSCRIPTIONAL TARGETS OF SOX2 CHANGE OVER TIME DURING EAR DEVELOPMENT.

UNDERSTANDING SPEECH IN NOISY ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRES PERCEPTUAL ANALYSIS OF SUPRATHRESHOLD SOUND FEATURES, IN CONTRAST TO AUDIOMETRIC THRESHOLD, WHICH IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE SOFTEST SOUND A LISTENER CAN DETECT. THESE SUPRATHRESHOLD PROCESSING DEFICITS THAT NORMAL HEARING PATIENTS EXHIBIT CANNOT BE TREATED CURRENTLY BECAUSE THEIR BASIS IN THE AUDITORY PATHWAY IS NOT WELL ESTABLISHED. A PROMISING EXPLANATION IS COCHLEAR SYNAPTOPATHY, WHICH REFERS TO INNER HAIR CELL SYNAPSE LOSS. SYNAPTOPATHY LEAVES THRESHOLDS UNAFFECTED, BUT DEGRADES THE ENCODING OF SUPRATHRESHOLD SOUNDS AS MEASURED BY THE AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSE (ABR), AND ALTERS EXCITATORY-INHIBITORY BALANCE IN THE AUDITORY PATHWAY, WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR ENCODING SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SOUND FEATURES. CORROBORATING EVIDENCE FROM THE HUMAN LITERATURE COMES IN THE FORM OF STUDIES SHOWING THAT NORMAL HEARING SUBJECTS DISPLAY SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL MEASURES OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PROCESSING. IN PARTICULAR, THE BINAURAL INTERACTION COMPONENT (BIC) OF THE ABR IS COMPROMISED IN PATIENTS WITH THIS PROFILE.

DESPITE THESE COMPELLING LINKS BETWEEN SUPRATHRESHOLD PROCESSING DEFICITS AND THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SYNAPTOPATHY, THERE IS NO DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT SYNAPTOPATHY CAUSES PERCEPTUAL DEFICITS. THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE SYNAPTOPATHY CAN ONLY BE VERIFIED VIA POST-MORTEM COCHLEAR HISTOLOGY, AND PERCEPTUAL MEASURES HAVE RARELY BEEN USED IN ANIMAL STUDIES OF SYNAPTOPATHY.

THIS IS TRUE FOR LISTENERS WITH NORMAL HEARING, LISTENERS WITH HEARING LOSS, AND, IN PARTICULAR, FOR LISTENERS WITH COCHLEAR IMPLANTS, FOR WHOM AM CUES ARE THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF AUDITORY INFORMATION IN SOME SETTINGS. THE BROAD GOAL OF THE WORK PROPOSED HERE IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW LISTENER UNCERTAINTY AND EXPECTATION AFFECT AM PROCESSING AND PERCEPTION IN DYNAMIC, MULTISOURCE LISTENING ENVIRONMENTS. THE WORK IS STRUCTURED UNDER TWO SPECIFIC AIMS. IN AIM 1, A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS USING NOVEL AND INNOVATIVE PSYCHOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUES, WHICH BUILD UPON AND EXTEND THOSE USED PREVIOUSLY TO CHARACTERIZE THE EFFECTS OF LISTENER UNCERTAINTY AND EXPECTATION IN THE CONTEXT OF AUDITORY INFORMATIONAL MASKING, ARE PROPOSED IN ORDER TO CHARACTERIZE HOW LISTENER UNCERTAINTY AND EXPECTATION AFFECT THE PROCESSING OF AM. IN AIM 2, FURTHER EXPERIMENTS USING SIMILAR TECHNIQUES ARE PROPOSED TO CHARACTERIZE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN THIS AREA. WHILE THE FOCUS IN BOTH CASES IS ON LISTENERS WITH NORMAL HEARING, THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS NEVERTHELESS MAY YIELD CLINICALLY RELEVANT RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DYNAMIC RANGE COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS COMMON TO MANY CURRENT-GENERATION DIGITAL HEARING AIDS CAN INTRODUCE RAPID, UNPREDICTABLE CHANGES TO THE AM CONTENT OF A SCENE, THEREBY INDUCING UNCERTAINTY IN THE LISTENER.

RECENT WORK IN RABBIT INFERIOR COLLICULUS (IC) HAS REVEALED A NOVEL FEATURE SENSITIVITY TO FAST SPECTROTEMPORAL CHIRPS. INDIVIDUAL IC NEURONS HAD DRAMATIC DIFFERENCES IN RESPONSE RATE TO DIFFERING CHIRP DIRECTIONS AND VELOCITIES. THE STIMULUS USED IN THAT WORK WAS THE SCHROEDER-PHASE HARMONIC COMPLEX (SCHR), WHICH CONTAINS A CHIRP WITHIN EACH PITCH PERIOD BECAUSE OF THE PHASE PROPERTIES OF HARMONIC COMPONENTS. SPEECH NECESSARILY CONTAINS SIMILAR CHIRPS DUE TO PHASE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HARMONIC COMPONENTS RESULTING FROM VOCAL TRACT FILTERING. GIVEN THAT IC NEURONS MAY BE AS SENSITIVE TO CHIRPS IN VOWELS AS THEY ARE TO SCHR CHIRPS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT NOVEL CHIRP SENSITIVITY IN THE IC SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TO SPEECH CODING AT THE LEVEL OF THE AUDITORY MIDBRAIN. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MORE PRECISELY DEFINE THIS SENSITIVITY IN THE MAMMALIAN CENTRAL AUDITORY SYSTEM TO FAST CHIRPS USING PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS, DESIGN AN IC COMPUTATIONAL MODEL THAT ACCURATELY REFLECTS CHIRP SENSITIVITY, AND TO ASSESS WHETHER CHIRP SENSITIVITY PLAYS A ROLE IN SPEECH CODING.

WE COMBINE WELL-ESTABLISHED WORD LEARNING PROTOCOLS WITH THE NOVEL USE OF ACTIGRAPHY AS AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF SLEEP. INDIVIDUALS IN THE CHRONIC PHASE OF MODERATE- SEVERE TBI AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY-MATCHED NON-INJURED HEALTHY COMPARISON (NC) PEERS WILL TRAIN ON A GROUP OF NOVEL WORDS, THEN BE ASSESSED IMMEDIATELY ON THEIR ENCODING OF THOSE WORDS. NEXT, THEY WILL PARTICIPATE IN ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF THEIR CONSOLIDATION OF THE NOVEL WORDS OVER REGULAR TIME INTERVALS THAT DO OR DO NOT INVOLVE SLEEP. IN AIM 1, WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WORD LEARNING IS IMPAIRED FOLLOWING TBI BY CONTRASTING GROUP WORD LEARNING PERFORMANCE AT AN IMMEDIATE POST-TEST. IN AIM 2, WE WILL DETERMINE IF INDIVIDUALS WITH TBI GET A SIMILAR SLEEP-LEARNING BENEFIT TO NC PEERS BY COMPARING PERFORMANCE AT POST-TESTS WITH AND WITHOUT AN INTERIM PERIOD OF SLEEP. IN EXPLORATORY AIM 3, WE WILL EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP, AS MEASURED OVER TIME VIA ACTIGRAPHY, AND WORD LEARNING IN THE SHORT (24 HOUR POST-TEST) AND LONG (1 WEEK POST-TEST) TERM. EXPLORING SLEEP\u2019S ROLE AS A MEDIATOR OF LEARNING AFTER TBI WILL IMPROVE BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TBI, SLEEP, AND WORD LEARNING. THESE FINDINGS WILL ADVANCE THEORETICAL AND CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SLEEP, MEMORY, AND LEARNING IN TBI AND WILL DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR LONG-TERM GOAL OF REFINING CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF LEARNING DEFICITS FOR IMPROVED FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AFTER INJURY. BECAUSE MEMORY AND LEARNING ARE CRITICAL TO AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM INTERVENTION, UNDERSTANDING SLEEP\u2019S ROLE IN SUPPORTING LEARNING COULD UNDERLIE FUTURE TRIALS OF BOTH DIRECT SLEEP INTERVENTIONS AND TARGETED THERAPY SCHEDULES FOR IMPROVED LEARNING ACROSS DOMAINS.

STUDIES MONITORING BRAIN-WIDE NEURONAL ACTIVITY UPON STIMULATION WITH SWEET AND BITTER TASTANTS IN DROSOPHILA SUGGEST THAT A LABELED LINE MODEL IS ALSO OPERATIVE IN THE FLY. HOWEVER, A SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF THE GUSTATORY CIRCUITS ON A LAYER BY LAYER BASIS IS REQUIRED TO FULLY EVALUATE THE CODING MECHANISM OF SWEET AND BITTER TASTE QUALITIES IN DROSOPHILA.

WE WILL EVALUATE CORRELATIONS AND REGRESSIONS BETWEEN MEASURES OF MOTOR COORDINATION AND SCORES ON ASSESSMENTS OF EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE. WE BELIEVE THAT MOTOR TASKS AND FEATURES WHICH SHOW HIGH CORRELATIONS WITH EVALUATIONS OF LANGUAGE ABILITY WILL PROVIDE FURTHER INSIGHT INTO HOW MOTOR MODALITIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES IN ASD. IN SUMMARY, THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO QUANTIFY AND UNDERSTAND SPEECH- AND FINE-MOTOR COORDINATION CHALLENGES IN ASD USING OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF MOTOR COORDINATION, AND AIMS TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPEECH- AND FINE- MOTOR SUBSYSTEMS AND EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE IN ASD.

ONE METHOD IS FOR THE BRAIN TO LEARN WHICH CUES ARE RELIABLE ACROSS CONTEXTS AND RELY ON THESE CUES IN THE FUTURE. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT SENSORY SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO ACTIVELY LEARN RECENT STATISTICS UNDERLYING CUE RELIABILITY AND ADAPT TO SHORT TERM CHANGES. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW SENSORY SYSTEMS ADAPT TO NATURAL STATISTICS OF SENSORY CUES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENT. WHILE HUMANS DISPLAY BIASES BASED ON LONG TERM PATTERNS OF SENSORY CUE STATISTICS, THE NEURAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THIS ARE UNKNOWN. TO ADDRESS THESE KNOWLEDGE GAPS, THIS PROPOSAL WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER AND HOW ANTICIPATED RELIABILITY OF BINAURAL SPATIAL CUES DETERMINES SOUND LOCALIZATION OF BARN OWLS. BARN OWLS COMPUTE THE INTERAURAL TIME DIFFERENCE (ITD) TO DETERMINE AZIMUTHAL LOCATION. PREVIOUS WORK SHOWED THAT THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO OF ITD VARIES ACROSS FREQUENCIES IN A LOCATION DEPENDENT MANNER, BASED ON THE ACOUSTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE HEAD. THUS, CERTAIN FREQUENCIES CONVEY MORE RELIABLE ITD CUES FOR SOUNDS FROM A GIVEN LOCATION, AND THE NEURAL TUNING IN THE MIDBRAIN IS OPTIMIZED TO REFLECT THIS PATTERN. THIS PROVIDES A SYSTEM WHERE THE RELIABILITY OF NATURAL ACOUSTIC CUES IS REPRESENTED, ALLOWING FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF ANTICIPATING SENSORY STATISTICS ON PERCEPTUAL DISCRIMINABILITY AND HOW IT IS LEARNED. RECENT WORK BY OUR GROUP HAS SHOWN EVIDENCE THAT HUMAN AUDITORY PERCEPTION IS ALSO SHAPED BY ITD STATISTICS, POTENTIALLY ALLOWING THE PROPERTIES OF NEURAL CODING INVESTIGATED IN THIS PROJECT TO EXPLAIN THE BASES OF THESE FINDINGS. THE OVERALL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT BARN OWLS LEARN TO ANTICIPATE CUE RELIABILITY DURING JUVENILE CRITICAL PERIODS, LEADING TO BIASES IN NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PROCESSING. BEHAVIORAL AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL APPROACHES ALONG WITH COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY WILL BE USED TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS. EXPERIMENTS OUTLINED IN AIM 1 WILL DETERMINE WHETHER BARN OWLS SHOW BETTER SOUND DISCRIMINATION FOR FREQUENCIES ANTICIPATED TO BE RELIABLE. AIM 2 WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER AND HOW THE NEURAL POPULATION DISPLAYING THE PATTERN OF ITD-FREQUENCY TUNING DESCRIBED IN THE MIDBRAIN EXPLAINS SPATIAL DISCRIMINABILITY. NOVEL MULTI-UNIT RECORDINGS IN THE MIDBRAIN IN VIVO ALONG WITH COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO ADDRESS THIS. AIM 3 WILL ELUCIDATE THE CAPACITY OF THE BARN OWL TO LEARN ALTERED FORMS OF CUE RELIABILITY, BY CHANGING THE ACOUSTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE OWL\u2019S HEAD AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. ALTOGETHER, THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE UNDERSTANDING ON THE MECHANISMS USED TO DEAL WITH LONG TERM PATTERNS OF CUE RELIABILITY.

CHEMOSENSATION TO EVALUATE THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND INSTRUCT A WIDE RANGE OF BEHAVIORS. CHEMOSENSATION IS USED TO LOCATE FOOD AND MATES AND TO AVOID THREATS. SUCH CHEMOSENSORY STIMULI ARE OFTEN COMPLEX BLENDS OF MOLECULES. HOW INFORMATION ENCODED BY THE MULTIPLE CHEMOSENSORY NEURONS THAT SENSE THESE CUES IS INTEGRATED TO FORM A REPRESENTATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND INFORM BEHAVIOR IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE MICROSCOPIC ROUNDWORM C. ELEGANS IS AN EXCELLENT MODEL TO STUDY IN ORDER TO DETERMINE HOW ANIMALS DECODE COMPLEX CHEMOSENSORY STIMULI TO INSTRUCT BEHAVIOR. ITS SIMPLE AND STEREOTYPED BEHAVIORS ARE ROBUSTLY REGULATED BY CHEMOSENSORY CUES FROM ITS ENVIRONMENT. IMPORTANTLY, POWERFUL GENETIC TOOLS AND OPTICAL METHODS ARE AVAILABLE TO STUDY THE CIRCUITS THAT PROCESS CHEMOSENSORY STIMULI. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON HOW C. ELEGANS USES ITS CHEMOSENSORY SYSTEM TO DISTINGUISH NUTRITIVE FROM PATHOGENIC BACTERIA. C. ELEGANS EATS MICROBES, BUT IT IS ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTION BY PATHOGENS. IT IS, THEREFORE, CRITICAL THAT C. ELEGANS RAPIDLY DETECT AND AVOID PATHOGENS, AND RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CHEMOSENSATION. PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS USED AN OPTICAL METHOD TO IDENTIFY NEURONS THAT ARE DIFFERENTIALLY ACTIVATED BY NUTRITIVE AND PATHOGENIC BACTERIA, AND THESE STUDIES WILL BE EXTENDED BY DETERMINING (1) HOW THE SENSATION OF THESE MICROBES GENERATES DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF NEURAL ACTIVITY AND (2) HOW THESE PATTERNS OF NEURAL ACTIVITY GENERATE DISTINCT FORAGING BEHAVIORS.

SUMMARY  CHEMOSENSATION IS AN EVOLUTIONARILY CONSERVED SENSORY MODALITY THROUGHOUT THE LIVING ORGANISMS. OLFACTION, ONE MODE OF CHEMOSENSATION, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO GUIDE NAVIGATION AND DECISION-MAKING IN ANIMALS OF DIFFERENT PHYLA WITHIN THE KINGDOM. HOWEVER, USING OLFACTION AS A SENSORY CUE TO GUIDE NAVIGATION IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM. THIS IS BECAUSE THE SPREAD OF ODOR MOLECULES OVER LARGE DISTANCES IS GOVERNED BY THE CHAOTIC AND TURBULENT FLOW OF FLUIDS FROM THE SOURCE TO THE SEARCHER. HENCE, THE OLFACTORY INFORMATION THAT AN ANIMAL RECEIVES DYNAMICALLY VARIES ALONG THE DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES. IN SPITE OF THIS COMPLEX SENSORY SIGNAL, RODENTS ARE REMARKABLE AT LOCATING SOURCES OF AIRBORNE ODORS FROM LARGE DISTANCES. THE STOCHASTIC OLFACTORY INFORMATION DURING THE NATURALISTIC BEHAVIOR OF PLUME TRACKING THEN PROMOTES ADAPTIVE MOTOR BEHAVIORS TO ACTIVELY SENSE ODOR INFORMATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFICIENT BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES TO LOCATE ODOR SOURCES. THE RODENT OLFACTORY SYSTEM THEN SERVES AS AN EXCELLENT MODEL TO STUDY HOW SENSATION GUIDES MOTION AND VICE-VERSA IN THE MAMMALIAN BRAIN.  CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE FOR CHEMICAL QUANTIFICATION ARE NOT FEASIBLE TO CORRELATE REAL-TIME ODOR INPUTS WITH BEHAVIOR IN FREELY MOVING ANIMALS. HENCE, WE FIRST DEVELOPED A METHOD TO RECORD REAL-TIME OLFACTORY INFORMATION USING LOW-COST SENSORS THAT CAN BE MOUNTED ON A MOUSE\u2019S HEAD. THIS METHOD THEN ALLOWS UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF ANALYSIS IN STUDYING HOW ODOR CONTACTS GUIDE BEHAVIOR IN PLUME-TRACKING MICE. HERE I PROPOSE EXPERIMENTS TO COMBINE THIS METHOD WITH BEHAVIORAL TRACKING TO UNDERSTAND ACTIVE SENSING OF ODOR INFORMATION, AND BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES EMPLOYED DURING PLUME-TRACKING IN MICE ENGAGED IN ODOR-SOURCE LOCALIZATION TASK. THESE BEHAVIORAL STUDIES WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE STUDY OF THE NEURAL BASES OF SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION DURING THE NATURALISTIC BEHAVIOR OF PLUME-TRACKING. DEFINING THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL BASES OF ODOR-GUIDED NAVIGATION WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW HUMAN BRAINS INTEGRATE SENSATION AND MOTION, AND TREATMENT OF DISORDERS THAT ALTER THIS INTEGRATION IN DISORDERS, SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA AND POST- TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations":

PREVALENT SENSORY PATHOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT AFFECTS OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF DEAFNESS IS ATTRIBUTED TO SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS, WHICH OFTEN INVOLVES THE DAMAGE OF AFFERENT NERVE FIBERS WHICH RELAY AUDITORY INFORMATION FROM THE MECHANOSENSITIVE HAIR CELLS OF THE INNER EAR TO THE BRAIN. THE RESTORATION OF PHYSIOLOGIC HEARING WOULD REQUIRE THE REGENERATION OF AFFERENT FIBERS INTO THE SENSORY EPITHELIUM OF THE COCHLEA, FOLLOWED BY THE REINNERVATION OF APPROPRIATE HAIR CELL TARGETS. NERVE REGENERATION STUDIES IN HUMANS AND OTHER MAMMALIAN MODELS ARE LACKING DUE TO THE LIMITED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE INNER EAR. THE ZEBRAFISH LATERAL LINE SYSTEM, COMPOSED OF SUPERFICIAL FLUID-FLOW DETECTING HAIR CELLS AND AFFERENT NERVE FIBERS, OFFERS A SIMPLE AND ACCESSIBLE MODEL OF NERVE REGENERATION. IN THIS MODEL, THERE ARE LIKELY VARIOUS PARACRINE, JUXTACRINE, AND NEURON-AUTONOMOUS SIGNALING MECHANISMS WORKING IN COORDINATION TO GUIDE AXON PATHFINDING AND TARGET SELECTION. AIM 1 OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL DETERMINE THE MOLECULAR CUES EXPRESSED BY TARGET SENSORY HAIR CELLS TO GUIDE REINNERVATION BY REGENERATING AFFERENT AXONS OF THE LATERAL LINE. FOLLOWING TRANSECTION OF THE LATERAL LINE NERVE, HAIR CELLS FROM THE ZEBRAFISH WILL BE ISOLATED AT MULTIPLE TIMEPOINTS. IN THESE HAIR CELLS, THE EXPRESSION CHANGES OF CANONICAL AND NON-CANONICAL MOLECULAR CUES THAT MAY BE USED TO ATTRACT AXONAL GROWTH CONES WILL BE QUANTIFIED THROUGH TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING. AIM 2 WILL INVESTIGATE THE NEURONAL BIAS FOR REINNERVATION OF DEVELOPMENTALLY RELATED HAIR CELL POPULATIONS. ALTHOUGH STUDIES SUGGEST THAT NEURONS RETAIN A MEMORY FOR THEIR ORIGINAL HAIR CELL TARGETS, HOW THIS MEMORY IS ESTABLISHED OR MAINTAINED IS UNKNOWN. A TRANSGENIC IMAGING TECHNIQUE WILL BE USED TO LABEL AND TRACE CLONAL POPULATIONS OF REGENERATING AXONS FOLLOWING TRANSECTION OF THE LATERAL LINE NERVE. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT NEURONS PREFER REINNERVATING HAIR CELLS THAT AROSE FROM A SHARED SENSORY PLACODE DURING DEVELOPMENT. AIM 3 WILL REVEAL CHANGES IN THE LOCAL PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE REGENERATING NERVE TO ALLOW ENTRY OF INDIVIDUAL AFFERENT FIBERS INTO THEIR TARGET ORGAN. BY IMAGING TRANSGENIC FISH WITH FLUORESCENTLY LABELED SCHWANN CELLS AND COLLAGEN, CHANGES WILL BE SHOWN IN SCHWANN CELL TRACTS AND THE EPITHELIAL BASEMENT MEMBRANE TO PERMIT ENTRY OF INDIVIDUAL AXONS INTO THE ZEBRAFISH NEUROMAST, WHICH CONTAINS TARGET HAIR CELLS. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT PHYSICAL GAPS FORM IN SCHWANN CELL AND BASEMENT MEMBRANE LAYERS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO DENERVATED HAIR CELLS TO ALLOW PASSAGE OF REGENERATING AXONS BRANCHING OFF THE MAIN NERVE BUNDLE. TOGETHER, THESE STUDIES WILL ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISMS GOVERNING AFFERENT NERVE REGENERATION AND THE REINNERVATION OF HAIR CELLS, WHICH MAY PROVIDE INSIGHT TOWARDS RESTORING HEARING IN THE DEAFENED HUMAN COCHLEA.

THIS IS DUE TO NECESSITY FOR BULK SURGICAL RESECTION, REGARDLESS OF TUMOR GRADE. AS SUCH, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL MEDICAL TREATMENT STRATEGIES IS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE OLFACTION IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION. THE OLFACTORY EPITHELIUM IS A NEUROGENIC NICHE THAT PRODUCES NEURONS AND SUPPORTING EPITHELIAL CELLS THROUGHOUT LIFE, AND VARIOUS UNDIFFERENTIATED STAGES OF NORMAL EPITHELIAL PROLIFERATION AND DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN ENB. THE EPIGENETIC REGULATOR POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2) HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN DRIVING PROLIFERATIVE CELL STATES IN STEM CELL NICHES THROUGHOUT THE BODY. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT PRC2 IS CRUCIAL FOR BASAL CELL PROLIFERATION IN THE OLFACTORY EPITHELIUM, AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT IT IS EXPRESSED IN PROLIFERATING CELLS IN ENB. BECAUSE ENB IS A RARE TUMOR, MECHANISTIC BIOLOGICAL STUDIES ARE SPARSE, AND NO CELL LINES OR MOUSE MODELS EXIST.

NOT ALL TYPES OF SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS ARE IDENTICAL IN PHYSIOLOGY AND A MAJOR PRIORITY OF CURRENT AUDITORY RESEARCH IS TO INNOVATE IN THE SPACE OF PRECISION AUDITORY DIAGNOSTICS AND TREATMENTS. UNDERSTANDING HOW SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF DAMAGE TO THE COCHLEA OR AUDITORY NERVE VARIABLY IMPAIR THE PERCEPTION OF DIFFERENT SOUND FEATURES IS CRITICAL TO IMPROVE TREATMENTS FOR HEARING-IMPAIRED INDIVIDUALS. THE HISTORY OF AUDITORY RESEARCH HAS LED TO CONSIDERABLE INSIGHT AS TO HOW ANATOMIC COMPONENTS OF THE AUDITORY PERIPHERY, NAMELY INNER HAIR CELLS (IHCS), OUTER HAIR CELLS (OHCS), AND THE COCHLEAR SYNAPSE FUNCTION TOGETHER TO TRANSDUCE, AMPLIFY, AND CODE SIMPLE SOUNDS. HOWEVER, THERE EXISTS CONSIDERABLE GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THESE PERIPHERAL COMPONENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE FIDELITY OF MORE COMPLEX AUDITORY PHENOMENA AND PERCEPTION. PITCH, THE PERCEIVED \u201cHIGHNESS\u201d OR \u201cLOWNESS\u201d OF A GIVEN SOUND, IS AN EXAMPLE OF A COMPLEX PSYCHOACOUSTIC PHENOMENON. PITCH CUES ARE USED TO LISTEN TO AND COMPOSE MUSIC AND TO PROCESS VOWELS, IDENTIFY TALKERS, AND CONVEY EMOTION.

THREE CATEGORIES OF PITCH THEORIES ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN PITCH CODING IN TERMS OF THE TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION OF OUR AUDITORY SYSTEM (PLACE), THE TEMPORAL INFORMATION PRESENT IN NEURAL FIRING PATTERNS (TIME), OR A COMBINATION OF THESE (PLACE-TIME). WE PLAN TO ASSESS THESE THEORIES IN THE CONTEXT OF COCHLEAR PATHOLOGIES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO DIFFERENTIALLY ALTER PLACE AND TIMING CUES, HENCE DEVELOPING A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF PITCH. BASED ON THE LITERATURE, OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT DEFICITS IN TIME AND PLACE CODING BOTH AFFECT THE NEURAL CODING AND PERCEPTION OF PITCH, BUT WITH DISTORTED PLACE CODING PLAYING A STRONGER ROLE. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY USING ANIMAL MODELS OF OHC, IHC, COCHLEAR SYNAPSE DAMAGE, AND DISTORTED TONOTOPY TO INVESTIGATE SNHL EFFECTS ON PITCH-RELATED ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY (AIM 1). OHC DAMAGE PRIMARILY DISRUPTS PLACE CUES, WHILE IHC AND COCHLEAR SYNAPSE DAMAGE ALTER TIMING CUES.

HOWEVER, RESEARCH FROM OUR LAB HAS REVEALED THAT OR EXPRESSION DEPENDS ON DIFFERENTIATION-DEPENDENT ALTERATIONS TO NUCLEAR ARCHITECTURE. IN OLFACTORY STEM CELLS, HETEROCHROMATIN DETACHES FROM THE NUCLEAR PERIPHERY LEADING TO INVERSION OF THE NUCLEUS. OR GENES SUBSEQUENTLY ORGANIZE INTO MULTICHROMOSOMAL COMPARTMENTS NEAR THE NEWLY FORMED HETEROCHROMATIC CORE.

THIS PROPOSAL AIMS FIRST TO CLARIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WM CONNECTIVITY AND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION IN TYPICALLY DEVELOPING INFANTS BY EXAMINING THE TIMING OF WM CHANGES WITH EMERGING LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT RAPID MATURATION OF WM TRACTS ENABLES INFANTS TO LEARN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE THROUGH ITERATIVE FEEDBACK BETWEEN FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LANGUAGE CENTERS.

BRAIN OSCILLATIONS EVOKED BY SENSORY STIMULI ARE FLUCTUATIONS IN FIELD POTENTIALS REFLECTING THE COMBINED ACTIVITY OF NEURAL POPULATIONS DRIVEN BY A GIVEN STIMULUS. OSCILLATIONS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN MANY SPECIES FROM INVERTEBRATES TO PRIMATES, AND HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN VARIOUS PROCESSES LIKE ATTENTION AND PERCEPTUAL GATING. BARN OWLS ARE SPECIALISTS IN SOUND LOCALIZATION STUDIED FOR SEVERAL DECADES. THEIR WELL- DESCRIBED MIDBRAIN STIMULUS SELECTION NETWORK, A CIRCUIT DEDICATED TO LOCALIZING SALIENT SOUNDS, PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF BRAIN OSCILLATIONS IN CODING. PREVIOUS IN VIVO RECORDINGS IN THE OWL\u2019S OPTIC TECTUM (OT), HOMOLOG OF THE MAMMALIAN SUPERIOR COLLICULUS, HAVE SHOWN THAT GAMMA OSCILLATIONS (25-140 HZ) ARE TUNED TO BOTH VISUAL AND AUDITORY SPACE. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS RECORDINGS IN DEEP MIDBRAIN STRUCTURES, LIKE OT, HAVE RELIED ON SINGLE ELECTRODES AND LIGHT TRANQUILIZATION. THESE TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS IMPEDE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OSCILLATIONS MAY SPREAD ACROSS THE SPACE MAP AT A GIVEN TIME, AND UNDERSCORES THE QUESTION OF GENERALIZABILITY TO AWAKE PROCESSES LIKE ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION. OUR LAB HAS PIONEERED POPULATION RECORDINGS ACROSS THE SPACE MAP USING MULTIELECTRODE ARRAYS, AND HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED CHRONIC MICRODRIVE IMPLANTS FOR RECORDINGS IN AWAKE OWLS. WITH THESE TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS, WE WILL ADDRESS SEVERAL OPEN QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ROLE OF OSCILLATIONS IN PERCEPTION OF SALIENT STIMULI AND STIMULUS SELECTION. AIM 1 WILL EVALUATE THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF GAMMA OSCILLATIONS, AND DETERMINE WHETHER OSCILLATIONS ORGANIZE SPIKE PATTERNING TO PREFERRED PHASES. INITIAL ANALYSES SHOW THAT SOUND STIMULATION WITH THE PREFERRED DIRECTION INCREASES POWER WITHIN THE GAMMA RANGE IN A FOCAL MANNER, SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SPIKE PATTERNING DRIVEN BY BRAIN OSCILLATIONS HAS A ROLE IN CODING SOUND LOCATION. AIM 2 WILL COMPARE OSCILLATION PROPERTIES ACROSS AWAKE AND ANESTHETIZED STATES. PRELIMINARY DATA AND ANALYSIS SUGGEST THAT WHILE GAMMA POWER IS HIGHER IN THE AWAKE STATE, PHASE LOCKING OF SPIKES TO GAMMA OSCILLATIONS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS STATES, SUGGESTING SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONAL EFFECTS OF GAMMA OSCILLATIONS IN ORGANIZING SPIKE PATTERNING ARE PRESERVED DURING ANESTHESIA.

THE IDENTITY OF THE GATING SPRING, THE ELEMENT THAT CONTROLS THE OPENING OF THESE CHANNELS, AND THUS THE PRECISION AND SENSITIVITY WITH WHICH WE HEAR, IS UNKNOWN. CONNECTING ADJACENT STEREOCILIA IS THE FILAMENTOUS TIP LINK COMPLEX, WHICH COMPRISES A DIMER OF PROTOCADHERIN 15 (PCDH15) AND A DIMER OF CADHERIN 23.

USING A HIGH-SPEED OPTICAL TRAP, I HAVE OBTAINED PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT THE DIMER OF PCDH15 IS STIFFER THAN THE MONOMER. IN AIM 1, I WILL EXAMINE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PCDH15 DIMER IN RESPONSE TO FORCE AT DIFFERENT CRITICAL CA2+ CONCENTRATIONS. I WILL PERFORM FORCE-RAMP EXPERIMENTS ON THE PCDH15 DIMER, IN WHICH FORCE IS INCREASED AT A CONSTANT RATE, IN ORDER TO DELINEATE ITS RESPONSE TO PHYSIOLOGICAL LEVELS OF FORCE.

FURTHERMORE, BY RELATING DST SYMPTOMS TO UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGY, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF DST CAN BE SEPARATED BASED ON THEIR PHYSIOLOGIC CORRELATES. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY ARE EXPECTED TO ELUCIDATE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF DST IN ASD, IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DISABLING SYMPTOM AND GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF TARGETED INTERVENTIONS FOR THE ASD POPULATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4a536007-27e4-2194-a125-f4b8c55294db-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F30DC019510_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110024619, "Award ID": "F30DC019276", "Award Amount": 179590.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-03", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING TYMPANIC MEMBRANE HOMEOSTASIS AND REPAIR AFTER INJURY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bb8d1cd4-e0ae-6348-a07c-04df6a112768-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F30DC019276_7529"}, {"internal_id": 133585035, "Award ID": "F30DC019274", "Award Amount": 128099.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-10", "CFDA Number": "93.173", "Description": "REDUCING INFECTION AND PLUGGING OF TYMPANOSTOMY TUBES THROUGH ZWITTERIONIC THIN FILMS - PROJECT SUMMARY ALTHOUGH TYMPANOSTOMY TUBE (TT OR EAR TUBE) PLACEMENT IS A SIMPLE AND COMMON SURGERY (754,000/YEAR IN THE US), COMPLICATIONS ARISE IN A SUBSET OF PATIENTS, PARTICULARLY POST-TT OTORRHEA (PTTO, 26%) DUE TO BACTERIAL BIOFILMS AND MUCUS PLUGGING (7-34%). THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO REDUCE THESE COMPLICATIONS AND ENHANCE THE FUNCTIONAL LONGEVITY OF TTS. MODIFICATION OF TT SURFACES TO PREVENT BACTERIAL ADHESION AND TO REDUCE MUCUS ADHESION COULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THESE COMPLICATIONS. WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A NOVEL PHOTOCHEMICALLY DRIVEN PROCESS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY FORMS AND GRAFTS ZWITTERIONIC THIN FILMS ONTO POLYMERIC MATERIALS USED TO FABRICATE TTS (E.G. PDMS). THESE THIN FILMS ARE POLYMERIZED FROM EITHER SULFOBETAINE METHACRYLATE (SBMA) OR CARBOXYBETAINE METHACRYLATE (CBMA) MONOMERS. THE CBMA/SBMA POLYMER CHAINS ARE CROSSLINKED TO EACH OTHER DURING POLYMERIZATION BY POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL DIMETHACRYLATE (PEGDMA). WE FIND THAT BOTH CBMA AND SBMA THIN FILMS PREVENT ADHESION BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE FROM FIBRINOGEN, PLATELETS, MACROPHAGES, FIBROBLASTS, AND IMPORTANTLY, STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS. WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND THESE PROMISING FINDINGS INTO TTS, WHILE DETERMINING HOW CHANGES IN CROSSLINKING DENSITY AFFECT END PROPERTIES. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF ZWITTERIONIC THIN FILMS GRAFTED ONTO THE SURFACE OF TTS TO PREVENT THE COMPLEX PHENOMENA OF BACTERIAL COLONIZATION AND MUCUS PLUGGING. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT CBMA AND SBMA ZWITTERIONIC THIN FILMS WILL PREVENT BACTERIAL ADHESION AND REDUCE MUCUS PLUGGING ON TTS. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY UNDERTAKING THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS. 1) DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF CBMA AND SBMA THIN FILMS ON BACTERIA ADHESION FROM STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA ON TTS. WE WILL TEST THIS EFFECT BY QUANTIFYING BACTERIAL ADHESION ON PDMS SURFACES USING VALIDATED IN VITRO MODELS. WE WILL ALSO EXPOSE RATS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLANTED WITH ZWITTERIONIC COATED OR BARE TTS WITH EITHER S. AUREUS OR P AERUGINOSA TO INDUCE BIOFILM FORMATION. 2) INVESTIGATE THE ABILITY OF CBMA AND SBMA THIN FILMS TO REDUCE MUCUS ADHESION, MUCUS DRYING, AND MUCUS PLUG FORMATION ON TT SURFACES. TO TEST THIS, WE WILL FIRST EXAMINE THE ADHESION AND DRYING OF PORCINE INTESTINAL MUCUS ON PDMS THAT HAVE BEEN COATED WITH THIN FILMS OR REMAIN UNCOATED. FINALLY, WE WILL TEST THE MUCUS PLUGGING ON COATED AND UNCOATED TTS INSERTED INTO RAT TYMPANIC MEMBRANES. WHEN SUCCESSFUL, THESE AIMS WILL IMPLICATE A NOVEL AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHOD TO PREVENT COMMON COMPLICATIONS OF TTS BY PREVENTING BIOFILM AND MUCUS PLUG FORMATION. BEYOND TTS, THE RESULTS WILL BE BROADLY APPLICABLE TO DEVICES WHICH SUFFER FROM BIOFOULING.

THE APPROACH COMBINES CLINICAL EVALUATION OF INFORMATIVE FAMILIES, GENOME SEQUENCING TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATE GENES, IN VITRO ANALYSIS OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF CANDIDATE MUTANT ALLELES ON GENE AND PROTEIN FUNCTION, AND IN VIVO RECREATION AND FULL EVALUATION OF THE PHENOTYPE OBSERVED IN CRISPR-CAS9 MICE BEARING THE HUMAN CANDIDATE GENOTYPE. THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEW GENES FOR HEARING LOSS WILL EXPAND DIAGNOSTIC GENETIC TESTING, YIELD INSIGHT INTO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF HEARING, AND ALLOW FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THERAPIES TARGETING THESE MECHANISMS. MY PROPOSAL DESCRIBES THE APPLICATION OF THIS APPROACH TO A CONSANGUINEOUS FAMILY WITH TWO CHILDREN WITH CONGENITAL, BILATERAL, PROFOUND, NON-SYNDROMIC HEARING LOSS. THE CHILDREN ARE HOMOZYGOUS FOR THE MISSENSE MUTATION ALDOC P.R149C. ALDOC ENCODES ALDOLASE C, ONE OF THREE ALDOLASE ISOZYMES (A, B, AND C) THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR GLYCOLYSIS AND FRUCTOSE METABOLISM. ALDOC IS HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN BRAIN AND IN THE SENSORY EPITHELIUM OF THE INNER EAR AND PLAYS A ROLE IN NEURODEVELOPMENT. MUTATIONS IN ITS PARALOG, ALDOB, LEAD TO HEREDITARY FRUCTOSE INTOLERANCE WHERE ACCUMULATION OF THE SUBSTRATE FRUCTOSE-1-PHOSPHATE CAUSES HEPATOCYTE INJURY AND CELL DEATH. HERE, WE PROPOSE A SIMILAR MECHANISM WITHIN THE INNER EAR FOR ALDOC-RELATED HEARING LOSS AND OUTLINE EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS. AIM 1. TO EVALUATE THE BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF MUTANT ALDOC P.R149C, I FIRST PURIFIED WILD-TYPE AND MUTATED ALDOLASE C FROM E. COLI AND DEMONSTRATED NEAR COMPLETE LOSS OF CATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF THE MUTANT PROTEIN. TO FURTHER QUANTIFY THIS MUTATION\u2019S EFFECTS, I WILL COMPLETE THERMOSTABILITY TESTING, MICHAEL-MENTEN ENZYME KINETICS CALCULATIONS, AND ALSO EVALUATE ITS EFFECT ON ALDOLASE HETEROMERS BY CREATING AND ASSAYING AN ALDOLASE A/C HYBRID SET. AIM 2. TO EVALUATE THE PHENOTYPIC EFFECTS OF ALDOC P.R149C, I DESIGNED A CRISPR-CAS9 MOUSE CARRYING THE HUMAN MUTATION. PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM HOMOZYGOUS MICE SHOW A MILD HEARING LOSS. NEXT, I WILL THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THE HEARING OF THE HOMOZYGOTES, WITH AND WITHOUT FRUCTOSE SUPPLEMENTATION, BY AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSE (ABR) TESTING AND ANALYZE COCHLEAR EXPLANTS BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. AIM 3. TO DETERMINE THE CELL TYPE(S) INVOLVED IN ALDOC P.R149C HEARING LOSS, I WILL UTILIZE SINGLE-CELL RNA SEQUENCING TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN INNER EAR CELL POPULATIONS BETWEEN WILD TYPE AND ALDOC P.R149C HOMOZYGOUS MICE. MY PROJECT WILL PROVIDE TRAINING ACROSS AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND GENOMICS.

VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS (ACHIEVE) - PROJECT ABSTRACT SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN GLOBAL HEALTH HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN RECENT DECADES. YET, SERIOUS DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES PERSIST, ESPECIALLY AMONG CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND THEIR ADULT CAREGIVERS. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) IS ONE OF THE REGIONS DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY MULTIPLE HEALTH THREATS, INCLUDING ENDEMIC CDS; EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES; INCREASING INCIDENCE OF NCDS, AND A SET OF EXACERBATING FACTORS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO POOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND INCREASED OVERALL DISEASE BURDEN AFFECTING CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND THEIR ADULT CAREGIVERS. SIMILAR TRENDS ARE DOCUMENTED IN SEVERAL OTHER LMICS, INCLUDING COUNTRIES IN ASIA AND EASTERN EUROPE. IN LIGHT OF WIDESPREAD HEALTH INEQUITIES AND GAPS IN THE TRANSLATION AND UPTAKE OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN REAL-WORLD SETTINGS IN LMICS, DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION (D&I) SCIENCE CAN ADVANCE TIMELY AND CONTEXT- SPECIFIC PUBLIC HEALTH SOLUTIONS. MOREOVER, SIGNIFICANT METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN DATA SCIENCE CAN CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO MORE ACCURATELY IDENTIFY AT-RISK POPULATIONS, BETTER UNDERSTAND PATTERNS AND MECHANISMS OF HEALTH BURDENS, AND ALLOW FOR MORE IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF IMPLEMENTATION GAPS AND DISPARITIES IN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND ACROSS POPULATIONS IN LMICS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM, ENTITLED \u201cADDRESSING THE RESEARCH CAPACITY GAP IN GLOBAL CHILD, ADOLESCENT & FAMILY HEALTH DISPARITIES UTILIZING IMPLEMENTATION AND DATA SCIENCES AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS (ACHIEVE)\u201d, FOCUSES ON INCREASING D&I AND DATA SCIENCE CAPACITY TO ADDRESS GLOBAL HEALTH DISPARITIES AFFECTING CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND THEIR ADULT CAREGIVERS. THE PROGRAM ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1: TO PROVIDE A RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM TO FIVE COHORTS (~50 TRAINEES) OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND POST-DOCTORAL TRAINEES FROM THE U.S., AND POST-PROFESSIONAL DEGREE GRADUATES FROM SSA THAT EQUIPS TRAINEES WITH D&I AND DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THROUGH EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING, MENTORING, \u201cHANDS-ON\u201d IMMERSION IN GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION AND DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODOLOGIES, INDIVIDUALIZED CONSULTATION, GOAL SETTING AND MONITORING AND WEB- BASED SUPPORT ACROSS TIME; AIM 2: BRING TOGETHER AN INTERPROFESSIONAL NETWORK OF COMMITTED MENTORS FROM THE GLOBAL NORTH AND THE GLOBAL SOUTH TO PROMOTE EQUITABLE BI-DIRECTIONAL LEARNING AND COLLABORATION AND ENSURE QUALITY TRAINING FOR PROMISING NEW INVESTIGATORS COMMITTED TO APPLYING D&I AND DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH METHODS TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES IMPACTING CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, AND THEIR FAMILIES IN LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS; AIM 3: TO EXAMINE THE SHORT-TERM AND LONGITUDINAL OUTCOMES OF THE ACHIEVE TRAINING PROGRAM; AND AIM 4. DELINEATE KEY FACTORS THAT UNDERLIE SUCCESSFUL MENTORSHIP AND TRAINING OF NEW INVESTIGATORS\u2013 WITH POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR NEW INVESTIGATORS WHO ARE FOCUSED ON D&I AND DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH THAT SEEK TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES IMPACTING CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, AND THEIR ADULT CAREGIVERS.
