(MHSI), A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC), PROPOSES A NEW THC FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM ON MILWAUKEE\u2019S NORTH SIDE STARTING IN JULY 2023. THE PURPOSE IS TO TRAIN A REPRESENTATIVE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE THAT SERVE A PREDOMINANTLY HEALTH, ECONOMIC, AND EDUCATIONALLY DISENFRANCHISED (HEED) POPULATION. MHSI WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND TAKE THE LEAD ROLE IN THE ACADEMIC, FINANCIAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, AND CLINICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDING CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, SCHEDULING OF CLINICAL ROTATIONS, AND SELECTION OF STAFF AND RESIDENTS. MHSI IS A MEMBER OF A GME CONSORTIUM, THE MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN AFFILIATED HOSPITALS (MCWAH), WHICH WILL PROVIDE MHSI RESIDENTS AND FACULTY EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT AND LINKAGES TO RESOURCES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING HEALTH INEQUITIES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MHSI AND MCWAH IS LEGALLY BINDING, WITH CLEAR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF EACH ENTITY. THCGME PAYMENTS WILL BE USED BY MHSI TO SUPPORT RESIDENT TRAINING AND THE CLINICAL ACTIVITIES AT THE AMBULATORY TRAINING SITE. ADDITIONAL PARTNERS FOR THIS NEW RESIDENCY INCLUDE THE MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN AS AN ACADEMIC PARTNER AND THE PROGRAM\u2019S HOSPITAL TRAINING SITES (FROEDTERT MEMORIAL LUTHERAN HOSPITAL AND CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITAL OF WISCONSIN), BOTH IN MILWAUKEE. MHSI HAS BEEN SERVING THE NORTH SIDE OF MILWAUKEE SINCE 1969, AND AS AN F QHC SINCE 1998, PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY CARE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, DENTAL, AND PHARMACY SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED RESIDENTS OF MILWAUKEE COUNTY, WISCONSIN. THE COMMUNITY AMBULATORY TRAINING LOCATION WILL BE AT MHSI\u2019S ISAAC COGGS HERITAGE HEALTH CENTER AT 8200 W. SILVER SPRING DR., WITH POTENTIAL EXPANSION TO MHSI\u2019S MLK HERITAGE HEALTH CENTER AT 2555 N. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. DRIVE. BOTH SITES ARE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS. MILWAUKEE IS A DIVERSE CITY 38.3% AFRICAN AMERICAN AND 18.3% HISPANIC (VS. 6.3% AND 6% STATEWIDE) AND IS ALSO HOME TO THE NATION\u2019S SECOND LARGEST HMONG POPULATION. IT IS ALSO A CITY WITH SIGNIFICANT POVERTY; OVERALL 29% OF PEOPLE LIVE IN POVERTY, MAKING IT THE FIFTH POOREST LARGE CITY IN THE US, AND 43% OF CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY, RANKING IT 4TH FOR CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY. MILWAUKEE HAS SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES, MADE MORE EVIDENT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. MILWAUKEE RANKED WORSE THAN ALL BUT ONE OF THE STATE\u2019S 72 COUNTIES IN TERMS OF HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HEALTH DETERMINANTS, ACCORDING TO THE 2020 WISCONSIN COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS. THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE MAKE-UP OF THE POPULATION; EACH OF THESE GROUPS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. IN RESPONSE TO THESE NEEDS, MHSI\u2019S THC HAS BEEN CREATED TO INCREASE PATIENT ACCESS AND TO DEVELOP MORE FAMILY PHYSICIANS FROM DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EQUIPPED TO SERVE HEED POPULATIONS. THE VISION IS THAT THE PROGRAM WILL ASSIST NOT ONLY MHSI\u2019S EFFORTS, BUT PRODUCE GRADUATES FOR ALL OF MILWAUKEE\u2019S FQHCS, WHO WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN PHYSICIAN\u2019S REPRESENTATIVE OF THE POPULATIONS THEY SERVE WITH CULTURALLY COMPASSIONATE AND APPROPRIATE CARE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": 2240000.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2eee49e6-f353-66d2-2e34-361f7a41d638-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_T9C49306_7526"}, {"internal_id": 159765567, "Award ID": "T9C49305", "Award Amount": 160000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-01", "CFDA Number": "93.530", "Description": "TEACHING HEALTH CENTER GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM - PROJECT TITLE: TEACHING HEALTH CENTER GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM EXPANSION FQHC: LAWNDALE CHRISTIAN HEALTH CENTER 3860 W.

A TOTAL OF 24 RESIDENTS TRAINED THROUGH LCHC\u2019S FMR WILL BE ABLE TO MORE COMPETENTLY PROVIDE CARE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS IN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS IN CHICAGO. LCHC OFFERS A FULL SPECTRUM OF AFFORDABLE, HIGH-QUALITY PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS IN LAWNDALE, GARFIELD PARK, AND NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. FOUNDED IN 1984 BY A SMALL GROUP OF LAWNDALE RESIDENTS, LCHC HAS WORKED TO IMPROVE AND GROW ITS MODEL OF CARE TO ENSURE COMMUNITY ACCESS FOR 35 YEARS. AREA PRIMARY CARE SERVICES ARE SCARCE OR AVAILABLE IN A LIMITED CAPACITY, RESULTING IN AN INADEQUATE PROVIDER-TO-PATIENT RATIO. OVER 130 LCHC PROVIDERS WORK ACROSS A SPECTRUM OF SPECIALTIES INCLUDING FAMILY MEDICINE, PEDIATRICS, OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY, INTERNAL MEDICINE, AND OTHERS, AS WELL AS LABORATORY, RADIOLOGY, PHARMACY, DENTISTRY, OPTOMETRY, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, SUBSTANCE USE, AND HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES FOR TARGETED POPULATIONS INCLUDING HEALTHCARE FOR THE HOMELESS.

THESE COMMUNITIES ACCOUNT FOR OVER 280,000 PEOPLE, OF WHOM 71% ARE HISPANIC OR LATINO AND 21% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY IN 2019, OVER 52% OF RESIDENTS ARE LOW INCOME, 16% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE NO INSURANCE, AND AN ADDITIONAL 33% OF PATIENTS UTILIZE MEDICAID OR OTHER PUBLIC INSURANCE. THE CHICAGO HEALTH ATLAS DOCUMENTS MANY OF THE HEALTH DISPARITIES FACED BY RESIDENTS IN LCHC\u2019S SERVICE COMMUNITIES. IN WEST GARFIELD PARK FOR EXAMPLE, 53.9% OF ADULTS ARE CONSIDERED OBESE, 1 IN 6 HAVE DIABETES, AND 1 IN 6 BIRTHS ARE LOW BIRTHWEIGHT. AS A LEADER IN CHICAGO\u2019S SAFETY NET HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY, LCHC WILL CONTINUE TO DIRECTLY PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF PRIMARY CARE SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE TARGET POPULATION. RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN ACROSS THESE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES DIRECTLY WITHIN ITS HEALTH CENTER AS WELL AS WITH ITS TWO PARTNER HOSPITALS LOCATED LESS THAN 2 MILES FROM ITS MAIN CAMPUS.

THE SITE VISIT WAS HELD IN SEPTEMBER 2022, WITH ANTICIPATED APPROVAL IN EARLY 2023 IN PREPARATION FOR THE FIRST RESIDENTS TO BEGIN JULY 2023. ONCE APPROVED, THIS RESIDENCY PROGRAM WOULD BE THE FIRST DEDICATED RESIDENCY OF THE METROHEALTH SYSTEM\u2019S FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER LOOK-ALIKE (MHS FQHCLA), AND IF SELECTED BY HRSA FOR FUNDING, LAUNCH OUR TEACHING HEALTH CENTER. THE MAIN TRAINING LOCATION IS THE BROADWAY DENTAL CLINIC (8 OPERATORIES), THE HOME OF THE MHS FQHCLA DENTAL PROGRAM. THE BROADWAY DENTAL CLINIC PROVIDES DENTAL CARE TO ALL MHS FQHCLA PATIENTS, THE PRIMARY DENTAL REFERRAL SITE FOR THE GLENVILLE HEALTH CENTER, SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAM, AND THE COMMUNITY MOBILE CLINIC. AS REPORTED IN THE 2021 UDS REPORT, THE MHS FQHCLA SERVED A TOTAL OF 8,187 PATIENTS THROUGH 18,333 VISITS, WITH NEARLY 50% OF PATIENTS RECEIVING DENTAL CARE. OVER 70% OF PATIENTS ARE BELOW 200% OF POVERTY, WITH ALMOST 20% BELOW 100% OF POVERTY. OVER 85% REPRESENT A RACIAL AND/OR ETHNIC MINORITY, AND OVER 75% ARE UNINSURED OR COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. ALL PATIENTS SERVED THROUGH THE MHS FQHCLA ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESIDENT EDUCATION. THE CORE VALUES OF THE PROPOSED AEGD RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND CORRELATED TEACHING PHILOSOPHY ARE TO TRAIN DENTISTS TO STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE IN (1) CLINICAL COMPETENCE, (2) PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE CARE, AND (3) CULTIVATING CURIOSITY ABOUT THE \u201cWHOLE PATIENT,\u201d EXHIBITED BY COMMUNICATING WELL WITH PATIENTS AND UNDERSTANDING THE MULTIFACTORIAL INFLUENCES THAT BRING ABOUT ORAL DISEASE IN INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES.  THCGME FUNDING SUPPORT IS REQUESTED FOR TWO NEW AEGD FQHCLA RESIDENTS PER GRANT YEAR, FOR A TOTAL OF 8 RESIDENTS. THE NEED FOR THIS RESIDENCY PROGRAM REFLECTS NOT ONLY OUR COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING CARE TO OUR VULNERABLE PATIENTS BUT ALSO OUR PLANNED GROWTH OF THE MHS FQHCLA DENTAL DEPARTMENT (5 TOTAL OPERATORIES), WITH THE ADDITION OF DENTAL ON-SITE AT THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED LOCATION OF THE GLENVILLE HEALTH CENTER AS WELL AS TWO SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAM LOCATIONS (ONE K-8 AND ONE HIGH SCHOOL).

IN A DEMOGRAPHIC-ONLY FORECAST, STATE-WIDE DEMAND FOR SERVICES OUTPACED THE SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS BY 2% OR 425 PHYSICIANS.  HOWEVER, IN A TREND SCENARIO ANALYSIS, DEMAND GROWTH OUTPACED SUPPLY BY 15% OR 4,444 PHYSICIANS BY 2020. IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT BY CIT IZENS RESEARCH COUNCIL OF MICHIGAN, PHYSICIAN DISTRIBUTION EXACERBATED PROJECTED PHYSICIAN SHORTAGES FOR SOME POPULATIONS BECAUSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF PHYSICIANS DID NOT MEET GROWING NEEDS IN COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE DETROIT METRO REGION, ESPECIALLY IN POCKETS OF OAKLAND COUNTY, HCH'S SERVICE AREA. HCH PROVIDES SERVICES IN A DESIGNATED MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY (INDEX SCORE: 55.0) AND IS A DESIGNATED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SHORTAGE AREA TRAINING SITE (HPSA SCORE: 19).  BY BECOMING A SPONSORING INSTITUTION AND DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER-BASED 6-6-6 FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM, HCH WILL ENHANCE THE PHYSICIAN PIPELINE IN ITS SERVICE AREA, INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY THESE ACUTE HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND OUTCOME DISPARITIES.  AS A NEW TEACHING HEALTH CENTER AS DEFINED IN THE PHS ACT, THIS RESIDENCY PROGRAM WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE A NEW SOURCE OF PROVIDERS TO THE PHYSICIAN PIPELINE THAT ARE EXCEPTIONALLY SKILLED IN MEETING THE UNIQUE PRIMARY CARE NEEDS OF HCH'S COMMUNITY.  TO ENSURE THAT HCH'S FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM (HCH FMRP) DEVELOPS PROVIDERS ATTUNED TO THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITY, HCH WILL LEVERAGE ITS STRONG COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS.  IN 2021, HCH WAS AWARDED A TEACHING HEALTH CENTER PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT GRANT (HRSA-22-107). HCH IS THE ACGME-ACCREDITED SPONSORING INSTITUTION FOR THE FMRP, OBTAINING ACGME INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITATION IN JULY 2018 WITH A FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL SITE VISIT IN AUGUST 2021. HCH HAS CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITATION WITH A WARNING DUE TO THE FACT THAT A RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS NOT CURRENT ESTABLISHED, WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THE ORGANIZATION IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING CREATION OF ITS FMRP.

ABSTRACT  THE TEACHING HEALTH CENTER (THC) GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (GME) PROGRAM AT OZARK CENTER IS A 4 YEAR PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAM ACCREDITED BY THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (ACGME). KCU-GME CONSORTIUM IS THE PROGRAMS ACCREDITED SPONSORING INSTITUTION. ESTABLISHED AS A COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTER (CMHC) IN 1965, OZARK CENTER PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN, ADULTS, AND FAMILIES IN A FOUR COUNTY AREA SURROUNDING JOPLIN, MISSOURI AND IS NOW A CERTIFIED COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTER (CCBHC). JASPER, NEWTON, BARTON, AND MCDONALD COUNTIES ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF MISSOURI, ALONG THE FOUR STATE AREA BORDER (MISSOURI, KANSAS, ARKANSAS, AND OKLAHOMA). THE AREA DESCRIBED ABOVE IS CLASSIFIED AS RURAL. THIS GEOGRAPHIC AREA QUALIFIES AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSA) AND INCLUDES AREAS CLASSIFIED AS MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED. 75% OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED AT OZARK CENTER ARE UNDERINSURED OR UNINSURED. AN INTEGRAL PART OF FREEMAN HEALTH SYSTEM IN JOPLIN, OZARK CENTER PROVIDED CARE TO 14,739 INDIVIDUALS IN 2021. FREEMAN IS A 407-BED, THREE-HOSPITAL COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER, WHICH INCLUDES ONE CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL (CAH). IT IS ALIGNED WITH OTHER RURAL MEDICAL FACILITIES INCLUDING ACCESS FAMILY CARE (AN FQHC) AND THE COMMUNITY CLINIC (A SECTION 303 LOOK-ALIKE). OVER THE PAST 48 YEARS, OZARK CENTER HAS CULTI VATED ITS PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH TO CARE IN CONCERT WITH THESE MEDICAL FACILITIES. RESIDENTS AT OZARK CENTER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN IN MULTIPLE SETTINGS. PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER, INCLUDING OPIOID DEPENDENCY, ARE OFFERED COUNSELING SERVICES AND MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT TO ASSIST WITH THEIR SYMPTOMS UTILIZING A WELL-BALANCED APPROACH. THE CRISIS OUTREACH PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE 24 HOURS PER DAY, 7 DAYS PER WEEK AND IS ACCESSIBLE BY MOBILE TEXTING TO ADDRESS PATIENT\u2019S NEED TO HAVE SERVICES IN URGENT AND EMERGENT SITUATIONS. THE CHILD PSYCHIATRY EXPERIENCE IS ENRICHED BY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RESIDENTS TO WORK AT THE BILL & VIRGINIA LEFFEN CENTER FOR AUTISM WHERE STAFF USE APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS IN THE TREATMENT OF AUTISM. THE RESIDENTS RECEIVE EXPERIENCE IN TRAUMA-INFORMED THERAPY DURING THEIR OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRY ROTATIONS. THIS VARIETY OF CLINICAL EXPERIENCES ALSO STIMULATES AREAS OF RESEARCH. TO PROMOTE RESIDENCY WELLNESS, AN INNOVATIVE WELLNESS PROGRAM HAS BEEN INTEGRATED FOCUSING ON MENTAL WELLBEING. THE IDEA FOR THIS PROJECT STEMMED FROM RESEARCH CONDUCTED WITHIN THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM. OZARK CENTER\u2019S PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAM STARTED IN 2012 AND WAS ORIGINALLY ACCREDITED BY THE AMERICAN OSTEOPATHIC ASSOCIATION (AOA) BUT IS NOW ACCREDITED BY THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (ACGME).

SPONSORED BY CLINICA SIERRA VISTA, A HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION OF 20 FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS, RBFMRP HAS AN ACADEMIC AFFILIATION WITH THE DAVID GEFFEN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT UCLA. FOUNDED IN 2014, THE HEART OF THE PROGRAM IS THE EAST NILES COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER IN BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA WHERE THE RESIDENTS SEE THEIR CONTINUITY PATIENTS. IN THE LAST ACADEMIC YEAR, THE RIO BRAVO RESIDENTS PROVIDED OVER 15,000 VISITS TO THEIR VERY UNDERSERVED PATIENT POPULATION AT THIS SITE. OVER 65% OF THEIR PATIENTS QUALIFY FOR MEDICAL, WITH ANOTHER 10-12% BEING UNINSURED. THE PATIENTS ARE PREDOMINATELY LATINO, INCLUDING MIGRANT FARM WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES, HOMELESS AND OTHER LOW-INCOME PATIENTS FROM OUR SURROUNDING HPSA/MUA.   THE RESIDENCY CONTINUES TO PROVE ITS WORTH TO THE COMMUNITY.  IN ADDITION TO THE PATIENTS THE RESIDENTS SEE WHILE TRAINING, THE GRADUATES ARE ADDING VALUABLE CAPACITY TO THE REGION\u2019S PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2021, THE PROGRAM HAS HAD 31 GRADUATES, WITH TWENTY-ONE CONTINUING TO WORK AND PRACTICE IN KERN AND FRESNO COUNTIES, INCLUDING THIRTEEN NOW EMPLOYED BY CLINICA SIERRA VISTA.  ADDITIONALLY, TWO OF THE GRADUA TES ARE US MILITARY VETERANS AND TWENTY-ONE ARE MEMBERS OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES, AS ARE 12 OF THE CURRENT 24 RESIDENTS. ALL OF THE GRADUATES HAVE PASSED THEIR AMERICAN BOARD OF FAMILY MEDICINE CERTIFICATION EXAMINATION ON THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT.  AS THE ONLY FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY IN KERN COUNTY AND FACED WITH A POPULATION GROWING FASTER THAN ITS PHYSICIAN SUPPLY, THE PROGRAM APPLIED TO THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (ACGME) TO EXPAND FROM 6-6-6 TO 8-8-8 IN 2018. THE RESIDENCY BEGAN GROWING IN JULY 2019 TO EIGHT RESIDENTS PER CLASS.  IN ORDER TO MEET THE HIGHER EXPENSES NOT COVERED UNDER OUR HRSA FUNDING, THE RBFMRP REACHED OUT TO THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT TO ASSIST IN BRIDGING THIS SHORTFALL. UNFORTUNATELY, THE STATE HAS UNDERGONE A SERIES OF TRANSITIONS, INCLUDING A CHANGE IN THE LEVEL OF FUNDING AND A RESTRUCTURING OF ITS DEPARTMENTS.  THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION (HCAI) IS CONTINUING ITS SUPPORT OF TEACHING HEALTH CENTERS, BUT AT A MORE LIMITED LEVEL.

A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES THE NAME OF THE  ACCREDITED SPONSORING INSTITUTION (AS DESIGNATED BY ACGME OR CODA) AND  DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN PRIMARY CARE TRAINING LOCATION INCLUDING POPULATIONS  SERVED. THE PRIME MISSION OF THE FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS TO TRAIN THE FUTURE LEADERS IN FAMILY PHYSICIANS AT BORINQUEN HEALTH CARE CENTER, INC. (BHCC), A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) AND TEACHING HEALTH CENTER. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS TO: EXPAND THE FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM AT BHCC\u2019S COMMUNITY-BASED AMBULATORY PATIENT CARE CENTERS; PREPARE RESIDENTS TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CARE, PARTICULARLY IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES; AND PREPARE RESIDENTS TO DEVELOP COMPETENCIES TO SERVE DIVERSE POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES. BHCC IS LOCATED IN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA AND HAS SERVED THE CULTURALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF WYNWOOD, ALLAPATAH, LITTLE RIVER, LITTLE HAVANA, OVERTOWN, NORTH MIAMI, NORTH MIAMI BEACH, KENDALL, WEST DADE, SWEETWATER, FLAGAMI AND LITTLE HAITI SINCE 1972. AS OF JULY 2022, BHCC WILL OFFER AN ACGME ACCREDITED RESIDENCY PROGRAM FOR FOUR FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENTS WITH ACCREDITATION FOR 12 FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENTS. WE ARE REQUESTING TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM RESOURCES, SUPPORT AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT FTE RESIDENTS, AND IMPROVE THE TRAINING PROGRAM TO MEET THE NEEDS OF AN EVOLVING HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT. THE POPULATION SERVED IS UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME, AND HAS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS, MINORITIES, AND PERSONS WHO SPEAK ENGLISH LESS THAN VERY WELL. THESE GROUPS FACE GREATER BARRIERS TO CARE AND HEALTH DISPARITIES THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION OF THE US. THE PER CAPITA INCOME IN THE COUNTY IS BELOW THAT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE STATE WHILE THE RATES OF POVERTY ARE HIGHER. THE PERCENTAGE OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY ALSO RANKS ABOVE BOTH THE STATE AND NATION. FURTHERMORE, ONE-FIFTH OF CHILDREN IN THE COUNTY LIVE IN POVERTY, A RATE THAT IS HIGHER THAN BOTH THE US AND FLORIDA. COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS, CHILDREN IN POVERTY ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE LOW BIRTH WEIGHT; CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS ASTHMA, OBESITY AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE; INCREASED ACCIDENTAL INJURIES; TOXIC STRESS; AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES.

IN THESE 46 YEARS, THE PROGRAM HAS GROWN TREMENDOUSLY TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND STATE. FMRI IS A SAFETY NET PROVIDER FOR ADA AND CANYON COUNTIES. IN CALENDAR YEAR 2021, FMRI SERVED 28,256 UNIQUE PATIENTS, 12.7% OF WHOM WERE UNINSURED AND 38.7% OF WHOM WERE RECIPIENTS OF MEDICAID, AT THEIR TIME OF SERVICE AND 47.3% OF FMRI PATIENTS IDENTIFIED LIVE ON AN INCOME AT OR BELOW 200% OF FPG, THEREBY SUBSTANTIATING THE ORGANIZATION\u2019S ROLE AS A SAFETY NET PROVIDER TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, FMRI IS AN MHC (MIGRANT HEALTH CENTER) GRANTEE, HAVING SERVED 385 MIGRANT AND SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS (MSAW) IN 2021. FMRI IS ALSO A MEDICAL POINT OF ENTRY FOR REFUGEES RESETTLED IN BOISE, IDAHO AND PROVIDES COMPR EHENSIVE PRIMARY AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO REFUGEE PATIENTS AND HELP REFUGEES ASSIMILATE AND RECUPERATE FOLLOWING THEIR TRAUMATIC LOSS. THE STATE OF IDAHO FACES SOME MAJOR CHALLENGES WITH ITS HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND ITS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IDAHO RANKS 49 ON THE LIST OF STATES FOR PHYSICIANS PER CAPITA IN THE 2019 STATE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE DATA REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES. IDAHO ALSO RANKS 45TH OUT OF 50 IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER CAPITA AND RANKS 47TH OUT OF 50 IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION RESIDENT POSITIONS PER CAPITA IN THE AAMC 2019 STATE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE DATA REPORT. ALL BUT THREE COUNTIES IN IDAHO ARE DESIGNATED AS A PRIMARY CARE HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO THE IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE WEBSITE. THIS MEANS THAT COUNTIES IN IDAHO HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS IN RELATION TO POPULATION DEMANDS OR GEOGRAPHICAL RESTRAINTS. NOTABLY, IDAHO\u2019S PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE IS AGING, WITH MANY PHYSICIANS RETIRING WITHIN THE NEXT 5-10 YEARS.

THE SITES FOR EXPANSION ARE HEALTHPOINT CHC IN AUBURN, WA AND WAIANAE COAST COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CENTER (WCCHC) IN HAWAII. SPECIAL POPULATIONS: HEALTHPOINT SERVES A LARGE PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATION AND ANTICIPATED MORE THAN 6000 AFGHAN REFUGEES FROM THE CURRENT POLITICAL CRISIS OF THE US WITHDRAWAL, AND WCCHC SERVES A LARGE NATIVE HAWAIIAN POPULATION. NEED - HEALTHPOINT: WASHINGTON\u2019S POPULATION HAS CONSISTENTLY GROWN SINCE THE 1900S AND HAS SURPASSED THE PROJECTED 2020 ESTIMATE OF 7.5 MILLION. THE MEAN AGE OF WASHINGTON\u2019S PRACTICING PHYSICIANS IS 51 YEARS, SLIGHTLY YOUNGER THAN REPORTED IN 2014. STILL, A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF WASHINGTON\u2019S PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE IS NEARING RETIREMENT AGE. COUPLED WITH THE STATE\u2019S AGING POPULATION, THESE CONDITIONS SUGGEST AN INCREASING IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND. TWCGME\u2019S NFMR HEALTHPOINT RESIDENCY PROGRAM SITE WAS ABLE TO KEEP 30% OF ITS GRADUATES TO CONTINUE WORKING FOR HEALTHPOINT. NEED - WCCHC: THE STATE OF HA WAII CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE ANY THC GME PROGRAMMING. AS AN FQHC IN HAWAII, WCCHC HAS A UNIQUE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE THAT IS AS OF YET UNSERVED BY ANY THC GME PROGRAM. WCCHC WAS FORMED, BY THE COMMUNITY, NEARLY 50 YEARS AGO DUE TO THE NEED FOR INCREASED PRIMARY AND EMERGENT CARE ACCESS AND DELIVERY FOR THE POPULATION OF THE WAIANAE COAST. HAWAII IS FACING A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO WORSEN. THOUGH A KNOWN PROBLEM FOR YEARS, HAWAII HAS HAD AN ACUTE SHORTAGE THAT IS BEING MADE WORSE DUE TO AN AGING POPULATION OF RETIRING PHYSICIANS, THE COST OF LIVING BEING VERY HIGH AND THE SALARIES BEING LOWER IN HAWAII, AND DUE TO THE IMPACT OF COVID.  THE PROBLEM IS WORSE FOR THE NEIGHBOR ISLANDS IN NOT BEING ABLE TO ATTRACT PROVIDERS.  A LOCAL PIPELINE OF NEW DOCTORS WHO CAN GO THROUGH THEIR RESIDENCY IN THE ISLANDS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE HAWAIIAN NATIVES (MEANING HOMETOWN SCHOLARS), IS THE MOST IMMEDIATE AND VIABLE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS.
