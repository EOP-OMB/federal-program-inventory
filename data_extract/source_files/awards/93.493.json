ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII, JOHN A. BURNS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE [1], SUBSTANCE USE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITY AMONG INDIGENOUS AND MINORITY POPULATIONS IN THE U.S., INCLUDING IN HAWAI`I. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE HEALTH PROMOTION AND PREVENTION RESOURCES ARE LIMITED. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF HAWAIIANS RESIDE IN RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE OF HAWAI`I. FURTHERMORE, NATIVE HAWAIIAN YOUTH TEND TO HAVE EARLY SUBSTANCE USE ONSET AND HIGHER USE RATES RELATIVE TO THEIR NON-HAWAIIAN PEERS.  THE RURAL ISLAND OF MOLOKA`I IS PREDOMINANTLY POPULATED BY NATIVE HAWAIIANS AND HAWAI`I\u2019S RATES OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE ARE HIGHEST AMONG YOUTH IN THIS CATEGORY. NATIVE HAWAIIANS ARE REPORTED AS HAVING THE HIGHEST LIFETIME AND 30-DAY RATES OF USING ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND OTHER DRUGS COMPARED WITH OTHER YOUTH ETHNIC GROUPS.[2] STUDIES SHOW THAT YOUTH WHO CONSUME ALCOHOL ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF UNSAFE BEHAVIORS, FOR EXAMPLE, PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ASSAULT, ALCOHOL INDUCED ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES, AND SUICIDE. ____________________________________________________________________________  [1] NATIVE HAWAIIAN HEALTH AND DRUG PREVENTION IN RURAL HAWAI`I | DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY \u2013 PORTAL [2] HTTP://BLOG.HAWAII.EDU/DOP/RESEARCH/INTRODUCTION/NATIVE-HAWAIIAN-HEALTH-AND-DRUG-PREVENTION-IN-RURAL-HAWAII/", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "HI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "dca792d3-3867-ace0-fe7f-420460e75ab9-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79FG000839_7522"}, {"internal_id": 152374105, "Award ID": "H79FG000838", "Award Amount": 3500000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-28", "CFDA Number": "93.493", "Description": "MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE - PROJECT ABSTRACT SUMMARY  SUMMARY: THE JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES OF DELAWARE (JFS) MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE IS AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO DELAWARE\u2019S GROWING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, RISING DEMAND FOR COUNSELING, AND LACK OF LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS.

CARES IS AN ON-GOING PROJECT. FUNDS ARE NEEDED TO EXPAND STAFF TO INCREASE NO-BARRIER, LOW THRESHOLD ACCESS TO EVIDENCE -BASED TREATMENT REDUCING THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT CAN PREVENT ENTRY INTO AND RETENTION IN OUD TREATMENT AND EXPANDING COMMUNITY CAPACITY TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS AND WHO MAY NOT BE READY FOR TREATMENT. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE PROVIDE DRUG USER HEALTH SERVICES AND ACCESS TO OVERDOSE EDUCATION AND NALOXONE, FOOD, TRANSPORTATION, AND LINKAGE TO MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THE GOALS OF THE CARES PROJECT ARE TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF DRUGS IN OUR COMMUNITY BY ENHANCING CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO SUSTAINED SUPPORT FOR A CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH OPIOID AND/OR POLYSUBSTANCE USE. CARES HAS FIVE PRIMARY COMPONENTS: INCREASING ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN SYSTEMS OF CARE AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH OUD; IMPROVING RETENTION IN TREATMENT BY ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH; PROACTIVELY RESPONDING TO EMERGING LOCAL CONDITIONS; INCREASING COMMUNITY CAPACITY TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIVING WITH OUD; AND IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC BARRIERS. THIS PROJECT DEPLOYS CARES NAVIGATORS AND CLINICIANS TO COMMUNITY SETTINGS WHERE THEY ARE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR OVERDOSE. ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE IN LESS DENSELY POPULATED PARTS OF OUR SERVICE AREA, THE CARES NAVIGATORS CAN BE REACHED THROUGH A CENTRALIZED PHONE NUMBER THAT INCLUDES TEXTING CAPABILITIES, THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELEMEDICINE. ONCE THE NAVIGATOR HAS CONNECTED WITH A PARTICIPANT, THEY USE MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THE PERSON NEEDS. THE NAVIGATOR CAN PROVIDE EDUCATION ON WOUND CARE, SAFE USE SUPPLIES, NALOXONE AND SUPPORT AS PEOPLE MAY BE FOCUSED ON THEIR DRUG USE AND WE CAN OFFER HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES SO THEY CAN STAY ALIVE. THE NAVIGATOR CAN PROVIDE LINKAGES TO ANY SERVICE INCLUDING ON-DEMAND MEDICATION FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER AND ONGOING SUPPORT.  THE PROJECT WILL SERVE RESIDENTS OF NEW LONDON COUNTY, CONNECTICUT. LOCATED IN THE SOUTHEASTERN CORNER THE REGION HAS BEEN HIT HARD BY THE OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC DRIVEN BY AN ADULTERATED DRUG SUPPLY. ACCORDING TO THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS, FROM 2015-2017 WINDHAM AND NEW LONDON COUNTIES HAD THE HIGHEST DRUG OVERDOSE RATE IN THE STATE (34 AND 33 PER 100,000 RESPECTIVELY). AN ANALYSIS BY THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH DEMONSTRATED FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, NEW LONDON COUNTY HAD THE HIGHEST RATE IN STATE OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OF VISITS FOR SUSPECTED OPIOID OVERDOSE (41.6) PER 10,000 VISITS) AND THE THIRD HIGHEST RATE OF VISITS FOR SUSPECTED HEROIN OVERDOSE (39 PER 10,000). THE EPIDEMIC CONTINUES TO GROW.  THE CURRENT PROJECT HAS SERVED MORE THAN 600 INDIVIDUALS WITH TWO FULL-TIME NAVIGATORS. WE SEEK TO EXPAND STAFFING AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE CAN SERVE.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO SUSTAINABLY SERVE PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE DISTRICT BY MAKING THIS APPROACH A PERMANENT FEATURE OF THE AREA\u2019S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SUCH A PRESENCE WOULD ALSO SERVE TO SHOWCASE THE MODEL TO DECISION-MAKERS IN THE NATION\u2019S CAPITAL, CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEBATE ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.   CAPITAL CLUBHOUSE IS A COMMUNITY-BASED 501(C)(3) NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH THE MISSION TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED BY SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. MENTAL ILLNESS IS A GRAVE PROBLEM IN THE DC AREA, AFFECTING SOME 21% OF ADULT RESIDENTS - THE 7TH HIGHEST IN THE NATION. THOSE AFFECTED ARE PRIMARILY FROM LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY UNDIAGNOSED, UNDER-DIAGNOSED OR MISDIAGNOSED FOR CULTURAL AND HISTORIC REASONS. PEOPLE OF COLOR CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY 60% OF CLUBHOUSE MEMBERSHIP. CAPITAL CLUBHOUSE SERVES INDIVIDUALS WITH A VARIETY OF DIAGNOSES, WITH THE TWO LARGEST GROUPS BEING THOSE DIAGNOSED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER (21%) AND WITH SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER (16%).  THE \u201cCLUBHOUSE\u201d MODEL\u201d PROVIDES A PROVEN APPROACH THAT HELPS INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR RECOVERY BY FULFILLING THEIR ASPIRATIONS IN WORK, EDUCATION, AND CONNECTION TO COMMUNITY.

IN 2019, THE FHN COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED BEHAVIORAL HEALTHCARE AS A TOP PRIORITY ISSUE FACING THE COMMUNITY.

UNFORTUNATELY, THE SUICIDE RATE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN STEPHENSON COUNTY THAN THE STATE, REFLECTING THE NEED FOR MORE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, HRSA HAS IDENTIFIED STEPHENSON COUNTY IN NEED OF AT LEAST 3.41 FTE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET POPULATION TO PRACTITIONER RATIO, WITHOUT EVEN CONSIDERING THE SHORTAGE OF SUD TREATMENT PROVIDERS IN THE COUNTY.

FROM A MULTITUDE OF SOCIAL, CLINICAL, FINANCIAL AND POPULATION HEALTH PERSPECTIVES, EVIDENCE INCREASINGLY DEMONSTRATES A CONNECTION BETWEEN POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND SERVICES FOCUSED ON SDOH \u2013 DEFINED BY THE CDC AS THE INTERACTIVE CONDITIONS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, LEARN, WORK AND PLAY. RELIANCE ON CRISIS SYSTEMS IN HEALTHCARE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND SUFFER FROM SUBSTANCE USE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS IS A CHALLENGE THAT IS RIPE FOR THE INNOVATIVE INTERVENTION THAT H2H PROVIDES. WITHOUT STABLE HOUSING AND COMPREHENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT, INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LACK ROUTINE HEALTHCARE, RESULTING IN FREQUENT VISITS TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, OFTEN WITH HOSPITALIZATION, RESULTING IN SPORADIC, POORLY COORDINATED CARE THAT CAN PRODUCE POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AT A HIGH PUBLIC COST. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT PROGRAMS SUCH AS H2H CAN DECREASE HOMELESSNESS, INCREASE HOUSING STABILITY, IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AND INCREASE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.  THE HOSPITAL-TO-HOUSING PROGRAM WILL AIM TO SERVE UP TO 50 PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS EACH YEAR. THIS $797,885.00 REQUEST WILL FUND DIRECT SERVICES FOR PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS STAFF FROM THE COMMUNITY AND HOSPITAL, WHO WILL COORDINATE TO IDENTIFY AND SERVE PARTICIPANTS.

THE PROJECT GOAL IS FOR MONROE COUNTY\u2019S BIPOC CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES TO HAVE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE, COMMUNITY BASED, AND COMMUNITY DRIVEN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND REPRESENTATIVE SUPPORTS TO AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS OF GENERATIONS OF STRUCTURAL RACISM, CONCENTRATED POVERTY, AND RACIALIZED TRAUMA AND BUILD PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR A HEALTHIER FUTURE.  THE PROJECT PERIOD IS FOR ONE YEAR AND WILL TRAIN AT LEAST 100, AND UP TO 200 UNDUPLICATED BIPOC ADULTS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE IN MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO BECOME CERTIFIED BIPOC PEER ADVOCATES. THE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION FEES CAN BE A BARRIER TO INDIVIDUALS AND WILL BE PROVIDED AT NO CHARGE TO PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THIS PROJECT.   SUCCESS WILL BE MEASURED BY TRACKING THE NUMBER OF BIPOC INDIVIDUALS RECRUITED FOR TRAINING, RECEIVING CERTIFICATION, AND WITH JOB PLACEMENTS OCCURRING FOLLOWING THE TRAINING SERIES, AS WELL AS THOSE REACHING SIX-MONTH JOB RETENTION. A PRE AND POST PROGRAM SURVEY WILL ASSIST IN MEASURING PARTICIPANTS\u2019 KNOWLEDGE, COMFORT, AND COMPETENCY BEFORE AND AFTER THE TRAINING TO DEMONSTRATE ITS IMPACT ON PREPARING PARTICIPANTS TO DO THIS MEANINGFUL AND CHALLENGING WORK. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROJECT INCREASED RESOURCES FOR CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE TOWARD MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO OUR LOCAL BIPOC COMMUNITY, THROUGH NEWLY TRAINED AND CERTIFIED PEER ADVOCATES. BOTH CERTIFICATION PATHWAYS WILL INCREASE PEER ADVOCATE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF BIPOC PEER ADVOCATES IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE FIELDS, THEREBY ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING THOSE MEMBERS OF LOCAL BIPOC COMMUNITY IN NEED OF THESE SERVICES TO SEEK TREATMENT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "a8a7ab2e-5af6-6884-7f9c-b3b8cc053133-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79FG000813_7522"}, {"internal_id": 152370521, "Award ID": "H79FG000812", "Award Amount": 461000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-28", "CFDA Number": "93.493", "Description": "HEALTHCARE INNOVATION AND SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AT UNITED SERVICES, INC. - UNITED SERVICES, A COMMUNITY-BASED OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTER, SEEKS TO IMPLEMENT AN INNOVATIVE HEALTHCARE MODEL AND ENHANCE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN OUR REGION, ESPECIALLY FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, THROUGH THE DELIVERY OF INTEGRATED PRIMARY CARE AT OUR FACILITIES.

IT IS A NETWORK OF SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH MULTIPLE ENTRY POINTS, A COORDINATED INTAKE, AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE.

THE MOST UNMET NEEDS THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IDENTIFIED WERE MENTAL HEALTHCARE, EMPLOYMENT, BASIC NEEDS (LIKE UTILITY ASSISTANCE), AND FUNDS TO FIX PROPERTY DAMAGE.

LOUIS FROM 2017 WHICH RECOMMENDED THAT INTERVENTIONS FOCUS ON NONFATAL SHOOTINGS TO INTERRUPT THE ESCALATING CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. VICTIMS OF CRIME ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY THAN NONVICTIMS TO DEVELOP POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER INCLUDE DIFFICULTY SLEEPING, DIFFICULTY PERFORMING ACTIONS OF DAILY LIFE, IRRITABILITY AND FLASHBACKS.

THE SECOND IS A CO-RESPONDER MODEL IN WHICH CLINICIANS AND SOCIAL WORKERS WILL RIDE ALONG WITH POLICE OFFICERS TO RESPOND TO INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE.

OUR IMMEDIATE-TERM GOALS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS BY IMPROVING PBIS SUPPORTS AND IMPLEMENTING A TRAUMA-INFORMED APPROACH. WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH SEVERAL THINGS. FIRST, HIRING A FULL-TIME YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH EXPERT WHO WILL DO THE FOLLOWING: 1. PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO CONNECT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH DIAGNOSTIC AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR ADVANCED-TIER PBIS REFERRALS; 2. FACILITATE ENROLLMENT OF ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WITH A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS IN MEDICAID; 3. WORK WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND COUNTY AGENCIES TO FACILITATE MENTAL HEALTH REFERRALS AND SUPPORT PARENTS/GUARDIANS; 4. IMPLEMENT TELEMEDICINE AND SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS BY IDENTIFYING RESOURCES TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL AND FREE/LOW-COST OPTIONS FOR SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE UN- OR UNDERINSURED. 5. IMPLEMENT AND OVERSEE A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CO-PAYS AND OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. 6.

THE PROGRAM, AT NO COST TO THE INDIVIDUAL SEEKING CARE, WILL HELP INDIVIDUALS ACCESS NEEDED CARE, UNDERSTAND AVAILABLE RESOURCES, OVERCOME OBSTACLES TO ENGAGEMENT, AND LINK TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE AND SUPPORT. THE NAVIGATOR IS THE STARTING POINT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNSURE OF WHERE TO START AND WILL ASSIST WITH COMPLETING AN ASSESSMENT AND CREATING A PERSONAL PLAN FOR NAVIGATING THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

OUR ORGANIZATION PROVIDES OVER 5000 CLIENT ENCOUNTERS ANNUALLY FROM BOTH THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL COMMUNITY WHO COME AS FAR AS 100 MILES TO SEEK BOTH MEDICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES. WITH A TEAM OF MORE THAN 100 VOLUNTEERS AND STUDENTS, WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO ANYONE IN NEED, REGARDLESS OF RELIGION, IMMIGRATION, OR ECONOMIC STATUS.  OUR CLIENTS ARE OFTEN FROM UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS, SPAN ALL AGES AND HAVE LITTLE TO NO ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. IF EMPLOYED, THEY ARE WORKING AT LOW-PAID JOBS IN SERVICE OR AS FARM WORKERS. WE SEE ALL OF OUR CLIENTS IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF RESPECT AND COMPASSION. SERVICES OFFERED INCLUDE PRIMARY CARE, ACUPUNCTURE, WORK/SCHOOL PHYSICALS, WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH, TUBERCULOSIS SCREENING, VACCINATIONS, MEDICATIONS, LABORATORY TESTING, SOCIAL SERVICES, REFERRALS, FREE FOOD, CALFRESH ENROLLMENT, AND SOLUTION-FOCUSED THERAPY.   THE JCFC HAS ALWAYS USED PAPER PATIENT RECORDS AND IS ONE OF THE ONLY LOCAL CLINICS WITHOUT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS).  THIS IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING AS WE ARE NOT A PERMANENT MEDICAL HOME AND REFER ALL OUR CLIENTS TO A COMMUNITY CLINIC IN THEIR REGION. PRESENTLY, RECORDS MUST BE FAXED OR COPIED TO CONNECT THE CLIENT WITH THEIR NEXT MEDICAL HOME. THIS CAN HAVE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON CLIENT HANDOFF, CONTINUOUS CARE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.   IT IS CRITICAL FOR THE JCFC TO MAKE THE LEAP TO EHRS. ADOPTING EPIC WILL HAVE LIFE-ALTERING EFFECTS ON THOUSANDS OF VULNERABLE CLI ENTS, AS RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT AN EHR SYSTEM CAPTURES ALL NECESSARY ELEMENTS OF CURRENT AND ONGOING CLIENT CARE. OUR EHR PROPOSAL WILL KEEP US IN LOCKSTEP WITH OUR SISTER CLINICS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY.  MOVING FROM PAPER CHARTS TO EPIC WILL IMPROVE THE CARE WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE OUR CLIENTS, STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY TO MAKE MEANINGFUL REFERRALS TO EVERY CLIENT, ENSURE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION TO OTHER AGENCIES USING EPIC, AND PREVENT THE USE OF COUNTLESS PIECES OF PAPER.   THIS PAST YEAR, NEARLY ALL OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CLINICS, THROUGH THEIR COLLABORATION WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTHCARE CONSORTIUM ALIADOS HEALTH, AGREED TO IMPLEMENT EPIC EHRS THROUGH OCHIN TO ALIGN WITH THE HOSPITALS AND CLINIC NETWORKS NATIONWIDE.  INTEGRATING OUR RECORDS WITH THE OVERALL COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEM IS CRITICAL. A DISCONNECT WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTY SYSTEM WOULD PLACE A NEGATIVE BURDEN ON OUR CLIENTS AND THE HEALTH SYSTEM AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE COHESIVE CARE AND QUALITY OUTCOMES. CLIENT INFORMATION WILL BE EASILY ENTERED INTO EPIC WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR FIRST VISIT AT THE JCFC AND READILY AVAILABLE WHEN THEY ARE REFERRED AND ESTABLISH CARE AT ANOTHER LOCAL CLINIC. ADOPTING EPIC WILL GIVE THE MOST VULNERABLE CLIENTS THE SAME BENEFITS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS THAT OTHERS ENJOY AS PART OF OUR MAJOR HEALTH CENTERS, OR OTHER COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS.

HISTORICALLY, THE JEMEZ DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS BUILT STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE JEMEZ HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES TO PROVIDE SOME HEALTH SERVICES TO THE STUDENTS OF THE WALATOWA LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAM, SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE CHARTER SCHOOL, WALATOWA CHARTER HIGHSCHOOL, AND THE JEMEZ DAY SCHOOL.

IN NEW MEXICO, THERE ARE SEVERAL INDICATORS SHOWING THE AIAN POPULATION IS IN PERIL, MORE SO  THAN OTHER RACES IN NEW MEXICO (NM). IN GENERAL, THE AIAN HAS 32.5% OF CHILDREN AGED 0-17 YEARS THAT LIVE IN POVERTY. THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE FOR AIAN IS 69% COMPARED TO 75% OF NM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS OVERALL. THE HEALTH STATUS OF AIAN IN THE NM IS GENERALLY POOR. IN NM, ONLY 59.9% OF AIAN HAVE ACCESS TO A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THE AIAI ADOLESCENT OBESITY PREVALENCE IS 22.8%, AND  AIAN ADULT OBESITY PREVALENCE IS 42.5%, HIGHER  THAN ANY OTHER RACES IN NM. THE TEEN BIRTH RATE IS ALSO SLIGHTLY HIGHER FOR AIAN TEENS AT 28.3 BIRTHS PER 1,000 GIRLS, COMPARED TO 23.8 (IN NM) AND 16.5 (IN THE US). A SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY WHICH AFFECTS THE AIAN COMMUNITY IS ALCOHOLISM. IN NM, ALCOHOL-RELATED CHRONIC DISEASE DEATHS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT 121.9 PER 100,000 POPULATION, AGE-ADJUSTED, COMPARED TO 37.3 FOR NM. THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT PLAGUE THE AIAN COMMUNITIES  DIRECTLY IMPACT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF AIAN CHILDREN. NEVERTHELESS, THERE ARE SEVERAL PROTECTIVE FACTORS SUCH AS CULTURE, LANGUAGE, A SENSE OF BELONGING, AND FAMILY THAT HELP IMPACT AIAN YOUTH RESILIENCE. THESE FACTORS ENABLE STUDENTS AND YOUTH TO DEVELOP A STRONG SENSE OF IDENTITY AND THE FOUNDATIONAL FORTITUDE TO GROW, LEARN AND THRIVE.  THE JEMEZ COORDINATED SCHOOL HEALTH INITIATIVE IS A PRO-ACTIVE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT CONTINUOUSLY IMPACT  AIAN COMMUNITIES. THIS FRAMEWORK IS DESIGNED AFTER THE CDC COORDINATED SCHOOL HEALTH MODEL, INCLUDING COMMUNITY STRENGTHS AND VALUES UNIQUE TO AIAN STUDENTS IN JEMEZ PUEBLO. THE TEN COMPONENTS OF THE JEMEZ COORDINATED SCHOOL HEALTH INITIATIVE ARE HEALTH EDUCATION, PHYSICAL EDUCATION, HEALTH SERVICES, NUTRITION SERVICES, COUNSELING/ PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES, HEALTHY SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH PROMOTION FOR STAFF, FAMILY/COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT, GOVERNMENTAL INVOLVEMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY/MEDIA. EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS IS INCORPORATED INTO A SOCIOECOLOGICAL MODEL THAT WILL INFORM THE RESEARCH AND EVALUATION OF THE FRAMEWORK.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EPIC WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE ACROSS THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, AND INCREASE PROVIDER SATISFACTION AND RETENTION. ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES IN COORDINATION OF CARE WITH AN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM (EHR) HAS BEEN THE INABILITY TO SHARE INFORMATION ELECTRONICALLY ACROSS HEALTH CARE ENTITIES.  COMMUNICARE HEALTH CENTERS IS UNIQUELY IMPACTED BY THIS DUE TO 42 CFR AS A PROVIDER OF PROTECTED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE EFFORTS DUE TO THE LIMITATIONS WITH OUR CURRENT PLATFORM, ECLINICALWORKS. CCHC CURRENTLY RELIES ON RECEIVING FAXED DOCUMENTS OR LOGGING IN TO MULTIPLE PORTALS TO RETRIEVE PATIENT INFORMATION FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, A PROCESS WHICH LEADS TO DELAYS IN MAKING VITAL TREATMENT DECISIONS. EPIC ALLOWS INTEROPERABILITY TO SHARE PATIENT INFORMATION WITH OUR LOCAL HOSPITALS.  HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS STRUGGLE TO ACCESS MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS IF THE PATIENT WAS SEEN AT A HOSPITAL OR CLINIC THAT USES A DIFFERENT EHR. THE SYSTEM ALLOWS PROVIDERS TO GIVE IMPROVED QUALITY OF CARE AS WELL AS LOWER COST OF CARE PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH CHRONIC AND COMPLEX CONDITIONS.

THE SYSTEM ALLOWS THE STAFF TO ATTACH BILLING CODES TO THESE ENCOUNTERS TO CREATE CLAIMS WHICH CAN BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY.

IT WAS THREE TIMES AS COMMON FOR CHILDREN WITH MEDICAID VERSUS THOSE WITH PRIVATE DENTAL COVERAGE TO FACE AN INABILITY TO GET A DENTIST APPOINTMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC. LENGTHY WAIT TIMES FOR APPOINTMENTS, OFFICE CLOSURE, OR A REDUCTION IN PATIENT VISITS WERE AMONG THE BARRIERS FACING PARENTS ATTEMPTING TO KEEP UP WITH REGULAR DENTAL CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THE POLL FOUND THAT 24% OF PARENTS EXPERIENCED A DELAY IN GETTING AN APPOINTMENT, WHILE 7% COULD NOT GET AN APPOINTMENT AT ALL. THIRTY-TWO PERCENT OF PARENTS FEEL COVID-19 HAS MADE IT HARDER TO GET PREVENTIVE DENTAL CARE FOR THEIR CHILD. FIFTEEN P ERCENT OF PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH MEDICAID COVERAGE REPORTED NOT BEING ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT, COMPARED TO 4% OF THOSE WITH PRIVATE DENTAL INSURANCE AND 5% OF THOSE WHO HAD NO COVERAGE.

FOR ADOLESCENT GIRLS WITH HISTORIES OF SEVERE TRAUMA AND RISK FACTORS FOR UNHEALTHY/UNSAFE BEHAVIOR, A LACK OF ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE GENDER-RESPONSIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES CAN LEAD TO INCREASED MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. SADLY, SCHOOL CLOSURES, ISOLATION AND SEPARATION FROM FAMILY/FRIENDS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT RESOURCES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY INCREASED THIS ALREADY CRITICAL CONCERN. THIS GROWING NUMBER OF ADOLESCENTS WHO LACK ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAS CREATED A NEED TO FIND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO BETTER REACH AND SERVE GIRLS.  PACE CENTER FOR GIRLS HAS TRANSFORMED THE LIVES OF GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS. FOUNDED IN 1985 WITH 10 GIRLS AT ONE CENTER IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA, PACE HAS SUCCESSFULLY GROWN TO ANNUALLY SERVE MORE THAN 3,000 GIRLS IN 24 LOCATIONS IN FLORIDA, GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA. DEDICATED TO CHANGING THE LIVES OF GIRLS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL LIFE, HEALTH AND ACADEMIC SKILLS, PACE HAS CREATED A SUCCESSFUL AND PROVEN EVIDENCE-BASED MODEL, THAT SINCE ITS INCEPTION, HAS CHANGED THE LIFE TRAJECTORY OF MORE THAN 40,000 GIRLS AND IS RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE NATION\u2019S LEADING ADVOCATES FOR GIRLS IN NEED.  TO RESPOND TO THIS CRITICAL NEED AMONG ADOLESCENT GIRLS IN HARD-TO-REACH GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS, PACE CENTER FOR GIRLS WILL DESIGN AND DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED TELETHERAPY PLATFORM SYSTEM TO EXPAND ITS ESTABLISHED REACH THERAPEUTIC COUNSELING SERVICES. EXPERIENCED PACE REACH THERAPISTS WILL PROVIDE GENDER-RESPONSIVE TELETHERAPY SERVICES TO ADOLESCENT GIRLS RESIDING IN HIGH-RISK/HIGH NEED AREAS OF BROWARD C OUNTY THROUGH A CUSTOMIZED, SAFE, USER FRIENDLY, RELATABLE VIRTUAL PLATFORM.    DURING THIS INITIAL TELETHERAPY PROJECT, PACE EXPECTS TO SERVE UP TO 80 HIGH-NEED GIRLS AGES 11-17 IN SOUTH AND WEST BROWARD COUNTY. TO BEST MEET GIRLS\u2019 NEEDS, TELETHERAPY SERVICES WILL BE BUDGETED AT SIX MONTHS PER GIRL\u2014ALL OFFERED AT NO CHARGE FOR GIRLS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS (AS WITH ALL PACE SERVICES).  PACE REACH THERAPISTS WILL PROVIDE TELETHERAPY PARTICIPANTS WITH PROVEN, EVIDENCE-BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TAILORED TO MEET THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL AND SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL NEEDS. GIRLS RECEIVING SERVICES THROUGH THIS PROJECT WILL RECEIVE ALL NECESSARY SERVICES VIA TELETHERAPY, INCLUDING INTAKE, ASSESSMENT, CARE GOAL PLANNING, INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY AND GROUP THERAPY SERVICES, CASE MANAGEMENT, LIFE SKILL COACHING AND REFERRALS TO OTHER NEEDED SERVICES.  THIS TELETHERAPY PLATFORM WILL DECREASE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IN-PERSON COUNSELING SERVICES, SUCH AS TRAVEL TIME AND EXPENSES, AND FACILITY RENTAL. THE PLATFORM\u2019S ONLINE ACCESS WILL OFFER GREATER TIME FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHEDULING DUE TO THE LACK OF TRAVEL TIME. FOR GIRLS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO LACK ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY FOR TELETHERAPY SERVICES, DEVICES AND INTERNET WI-FI ARE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET.

CSBS SERVE AS THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN VIRGINIA COMMUNITIES.  IN THE LONG TERM, THIS PROJECT WILL ALLOW FOR GREATER INTEROPERABILITY AND CLIENT CONTINUITY OF CARE BY SHARING DATA ACROSS THE FIVE REGION 2 CSBS, STATE HOSPITAL, AND VENDOR-OPERATED REGIONAL PROJECTS. THE DATA WAREHOUSE WILL ALSO ALLOW REQUIRED DATA TO BE REPORTED TO THE STATE USING BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE TOOLS IN AN EFFICIENT AND TIMELY MANNER. THE FAIRFAX-FALLS CHURCH CSB REGIONAL PROJECTS OFFICE IS THE FISCAL AGENT FOR PROJECTS SUPPORTING CLIENTS IN THE NORTHERN VIRGINIA AREA (REGION 2). VIRGINIA\u2019S REGION 2 CSBS INCLUDE PRINCE WILLIAM, ALEXANDRIA, ARLINGTON, LOUDOUN, AND FAIRFAX-FALLS CHURCH. STATE-MANDATED REPORTING REQUIRES PULLING DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES THROUGHOUT THE REGION INCLUDING CSBS, PRIVATE AND STATE HOSPITALS, THE NVMHI, AND OTHER RELEVANT PROVIDERS. DATA WAREHOUSE CAPABILITIES ARE NEEDED IN THE REGION TO ENSURE GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO DISSECT DATA IN MULTIPLE WAYS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND BENEFIT OF PROGRAMS BEING ADMINISTERED UNDER THE REGIONAL PROJECTS OFFICE.   CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED FUNDING OF $800K WILL BE USED TO CREATE AN INITIAL DATA WAREHOUSE AT THE CSB. THE PROJECT IS ALIGNED WITH THE FAIRFAX COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ROAD MAP DEVELOPED IN 2016 AS DATA AND THE NEED TO ACCESS DATA FOR ANALYSIS REMAINS A TOP COUNTY AND AGENCY PRIORITY.

THE CREATION OF THIS AGENCY DATA WAREHOUSE WILL ENHANCE CSB\u2019S RESPONSIVENESS TO THE NEEDS OF AN EVER-CHANGING HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, ENSURE PROPER ASSESSMENT OF PROGRAM PERFORMANCE, IDENTIFY LONG TERM TRENDS, AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF CRITICAL CLIENT SERVICES.   THE PROJECT IS SUPPORTED BY OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND NECESSARY FOR TRACKING DATA THAT MUST BE REPORTED TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES (DBHDS). CSB REPORTING IS MANDATED BY THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA. CURRENTLY EACH ENTITY SUBMITS DATA INDIVIDUALLY TO THE STATE. A DATA WAREHOUSE WILL ALLOW THE COUNTY AND STAKEHOLDERS TO SHARE DATA MORE SEAMLESSLY AND WITH GREATER INTEROPERABILITY.   WITH ALL CSBS IN REGION 2 ALSO DEALING WITH OVERWHELMING DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, THE GOAL IS TO MOVE TO A REGIONAL DATA WAREHOUSE AFTER THE CSB LAUNCHES THE INITIAL DATA WAREHOUSE. A REGIONAL DATA WAREHOUSE COULD ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR EACH CSB TO SEPARATELY SEND DATA TO STATE ENTITIES. THIS WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASED ABILITY TO MEET THE REGIONAL GOAL OF ENSURING TIMELY AND ACCURATE REPORTING. THE INCREASED RELIABILITY AND CADENCE IN WHICH DATA IS REPORTED TO THE STATE WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR MORE TIMELY DECISION MAKING.  THE INITIAL PROJECT WILL BE MANAGED BY THE FAIRFAX FALLS-CHURCH CSB.

WHILE THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH A LONG HISTORY, THE EXTRA CHALLENGES POSED BY COVID-19 HAVE INCREASED ITS URGENCY.    THE CHILDREN\u2019S ORAL HEALTH NETWORK (COHN), WITH BACKBONE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE HARRY E DAVIS PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN\u2019S ORAL HEALTH, HAS DEVELOPED A COLLABORATIVE INITIATIVE WITH NONPROFIT DENTAL CLINICS AND LOCAL HEAD START AND EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMSTO LAUNCH A NETWORK OF VIRTUAL DENTAL HOMES. THIS APPROACH IS BASED ON A SUCCESSFUL MODEL DEVELOPED BY DR. PAUL GLASSMAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY AND REPLICATED IN MULTIPLE STATES.  THE VIRTUAL DENTAL HOME (VDH) MODEL HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A PROMISING PRACTICE BY THE ASSOCIATION OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROGRAMS AND THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH POLICY\u2019S RURAL HEALTH INFORMATION HUB.  VDH IS A COMMUNITY-BASED ORAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN WHICH CHILDREN BECOME ESTABLISHED PATIENTS WITH A DENTAL PRACTICE BUT RECEIVE THEIR PREVENTIVE CARE AND EARLY INTERVENTION IN SCHOOL AND PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS WITHOUT HAVING TO TRAVEL TO THE DENTAL OFFICE FOR APPOINTMENTS UNLESS THEY NEED MORE COMPLEX TREATMENT.  THIS APPROACH ELIMINATES MANY OF THE LOGISTICAL BARRIERS THAT PARENTS IN RURAL MAINE COUNTIES FACE IN TRYING TO GET THEIR CHILDREN TO A DENTAL OFFICE FOR ROUTINE CARE.  MAINE\u2019S VDH PILOT WILL BEGIN SERVING CHILDREN FIRST IN HEAD START PROGRAMS AND THEN EXTENDING INTO PRIMARY CARE AND SCHOOL SETTINGS. LICENSED PUBLIC HEALTH AND INDEPENDENT PRACTICE DENTAL HYGIENISTS WILL DELIVER THE COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES USING TEL EHEALTH TECHNOLOGY TO SHARE PHOTOS, IMAGES, AND ASSESSMENT RESULTS WITH DENTISTS AT AN OFFICE LOCATION. THE DENTIST WILL COMPLETE THE EXAM REMOTELY AND CREATE A TREATMENT PLAN FOR FOLLOW-UP CARE AS NEEDED. WHEN MORE COMPLEX DENTAL TREATMENT IS NECESSARY, CHILDREN WILL BE SCHEDULED TO BE SEEN BY THE DENTIST AT THE DENTAL OFFICE. BASED ON EXPERIENCE IN OTHER STATES, WE EXPECT THAT 75% OF THE CARE THAT CHILDREN NEED CAN BE DELIVERED ON-SITE IN THEIR SCHOOL OR CHILDCARE SETTING.

IN THE MARKIN CENTER AT BRADLEY UNIVERSITY, A 700 SQUARE FEET COMPUTER LAB WILL BE REMODELED AND CONVERTED TO A MULTI-PATIENT SIMULATION LAB THAT WILL CONSIST OF HIGH-FIDELITY SIMULATION MANIKINS IN A SIMULATED HOSPITAL SPACE. THESE MANIKINS ARE DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE TRAINING FOR NURSING PROFESSIONALS BY SIMULATING REALISTIC HUMAN TRAITS THROUGH HEALTH CARE LEARNING SCENARIOS. THIS SIMULATION CENTER WILL ALLOW TRAINING FOR NEW NURSES TO CARE FOR PATIENTS IN THE SAFEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER USING THE LATEST SIMULATION TECHNOLOGY. THE ADDITIONAL SPACE AND EQUIPMENT WILL ALLOW NURSING FACULTY TO PROVIDE COMPETENCY-BASED EDUCATION AND SKILL VALIDATION FOR UNDERGRADUATE NURSING STUDENTS. ENTERING THE WORKFORCE WITH SKILL COMPETENCY AND PRACTICE IN CRITICAL-THINKING, COMMUNICATION, AND A PATIENT-CENTERED FOCUS IS ESSENTIAL TO SAFETY AND QUALITY PATIENT CARE.

WITH THE AUTHORITY PROVIDED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, THE HEALTH DISTRICT WOULD BECOME A COUNTY DEPARTMENT SERVING ALL THREE JURISDICTIONS. AS SUCH, IT WOULD ALLOW THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIVE AND AGILE IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY DURING EMERGENCIES, TO INCLUDE PROCURING AND OBTAINING GOODS, MATERIALS AND RESOURCES; PROVIDE PAY EQUITY FOR EMPLOYEES AND CONSISTENT CLASSIFICATIONS, PAY SCALES BENEFITS AND POLICIES FOR LOCAL AND STATE EMPLOYEES ALIKE; PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER MATERIAL; STREAMLINE ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES AND REDUCES DUPLICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORTS; AND INCREASE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO NEW LOCAL HEALTH INITIATIVES AND LOCAL STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS.   PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH THE CITY OF MANASSAS, THE CITY OF MANASSAS PARK, THE PRINCE WILLIAM HEALTH DISTRICT AND THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO BEGIN THE TRANSITION TO A LOCALLY ADMINISTERED HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, A STAKEHOLDER WORKING GROUP WAS CREATED WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL AFFECTED ENTITIES TO RESEARCH AND GATHER THE NECESSARY DATA FOR TRANSITION. THE WORKING GROUP CREATED FIVE S UB-TEAMS BASED ON THE MAJOR AREAS OF TRANSITION \u2013 ADMINISTRATION, HR, TECHNOLOGY, FACILITIES AND FLEET, AND FINANCE. ONE OF THE MAJOR FINDINGS OF THE SUB-TEAMS WAS THE NEED TO DO A FULL REPLACEMENT OF COMPUTERS AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE HEALTH DISTRICT STAFF. A FULL REPLACEMENT STRATEGY ENABLES CONSISTENCY IN IT STANDARD EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES; CONSISTENT AND STANDARD SECURITY POLICIES, CONTROLS AND ENFORCEMENT; AND COST SAVINGS THROUGH ECONOMIES OF SCALE.   IN ORDER TO MEET THE TRANSITION DEADLINE AND TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH DISTRICT EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO SEAMLESSLY CONTINUE THEIR WORK FROM DAY ONE, NEW LAPTOPS, MONITORS, PRINTERS, MOBILE DEVICES (PHONES AND TABLETS), AND OTHER HARDWARE/EQUIPMENT FOR 96 HEALTH DISTRICT EMPLOYEES MUST BE ORDERED AND READY TO BE INSTALLED BEFORE JULY 1, 2023. THE COUNTY MUST ALSO PROVIDE COUNTY EMAIL ACCOUNTS FOR EACH STATE EMPLOYEE AND INCLUDE THOSE EMPLOYEES IN THE COUNTY\u2019S ENTERPRISE MICROSOFT ACCOUNT. FEDERAL FUNDING WILL BE USED TO PURCHASE THE ONE-TIME TECHNOLOGY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION AND IS EXPECTED TO TAKE SIX TO 10 MONTHS TO COMPLETE, DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT DUE TO SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES.  A LOCALLY ADMINISTERED HEALTH DEPARTMENT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO STREAMLINE ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORTS AND REMOVE DUPLICATION AND INEFFICIENCIES. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE COUNTY THE ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY IN A PROACTIVE AND AGILE MANNER. ENSURING THAT HEALTH DISTRICT EMPLOYEES HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WILL ALLOW FOR A SEAMLESS TRANSITION TO OCCUR.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "18898a52-0d6e-d890-e139-a037ff805057-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_GE146323_7526"}, {"internal_id": 150745779, "Award ID": "GE146255", "Award Amount": 473000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-07-27", "CFDA Number": "93.493", "Description": "COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING/CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING - NON-CONSTRUCTION - - ADDRESS : UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER, MSC 09 5220, 1 UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131-0001 - PROJECT DIRECTOR NAME(S) : REBECCA KILBURN / THERESA H CRUZ - CONTACT PHONE NUMBERS : DIRECTOR PHONE: (505) 272-4462, UNM SPO PHONE: (505) 272-9383, FAX: (505) 272-0159 - EMAIL ADDRESS : REBECCA KILBURN - MKILBURN@SALUD.UNM.EDU / THERESA H CRUZ - THCRUZ@SALUD.UNM.EDU  GOAL: TO INFORM DECISIONS REGARDING IN-PERSON AND VIRTUAL EARLY CHILDHOOD HOME VISITING POLICY AND PROGRAMMING AIM 1: TO ESTIMATE THE AVAILABILITY AND USE OF BROADBAND AND CELL SERVICE AMONG FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN IN NEW MEXICO AIM 2: TO PILOT TEST PROMISING APPROACHES TO HYBRID HOME VISITING IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE APPROACH THAT PROVIDES COST-EFFECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN CHILD AND FAMILY OUTCOMES  BACKGROUND:  EARLY CHILDHOOD HOME VISITING (ECHV) IS A VOLUNTARY, HOME-BASED, PREVENTION STRATEGY THAT PAIRS PROFESSIONALS OR PARAPROFESSIONALS WITH PREGNANT WOMEN AND PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN (PRE-KINDERGARTEN) TO HELP MITIGATE THE POOR OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, ECHV PROGRAMS IN NEW MEXICO PIVOTED TO A VIRTUAL MODEL TO CONTINUE SERVICES WHILE HEALTH PRECAUTIONS PRECLUDED IN-PERSON VISITS. CURRENTLY, ECHV PROGRAMS CAN CONDUCT VISITS IN-PERSON OR VIRTUALLY. VIRTUAL VISITS COST CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN IN-PERSON VISITS, SO A HYBRID APPROACH COULD SAVE MONEY AND ENABLE MORE FAMILIES TO RECEIVE SERVICES. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT KNOWN THE EXTENT TO WHICH VIRTUAL SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE BY NM FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN, NOR THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT MODELS OF HYBRID (IN-PERSON AND VIRTUAL) SERVICES PROVIDE COST-EFFECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN MATERNAL HEALTH, CHILD HEALTH, AND OTHER RELATED OUTCOMES.   IN ORDER FOR HOME VISITS TO BE CONDUCTED VIRTUALLY, FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN NEED BROADBAND SERVICE WHICH PROVIDES HIGH-SPEED INTERNET AND/OR RELIABLE CELLULAR PHONE SERVICE.  THE FAMILY ALSO NEEDS A SUBSCRIPTION OR OTHER SERVICE THAT THEY CAN USE FOR ACCESSING THE BROADBAND OR CELLULAR SERVICE ON DEVICES.

MANY BARRIERS EXIST FOR PARENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT PREVENT EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND LIMIT THERAPEUTIC SERVICES. A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER IS THE LONG WAITLISTS FOR AUTISM EVALUATIONS, WHICH IS PRESENTLY LONGER THAN 6 MONTHS IN SOUTHWEST MISSOURI. THERE ARE PRESENTLY FIVE AUTISM CLINICS IN MISSOURI WITH THE CLOSEST IN COLUMBIA, MISSOURI -160 MILES AWAY. MANY FAMILIES ARE UNDERINSURED AND DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE AREA TO OBTAIN SERVICES. WITH A FORMAL DIAGNOSIS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES, A LOCAL AUTISM CLINIC FOR THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OF SOUTHWEST MISSOU RI IS NECESSARY TO INCREASE ACCESS TO DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPY SERVICES.

THE NAVIGATOR SITS DOWN WITH CLIENTS TO ASSESS THEIR NEEDS AND MATCH THEM TO SERVICES - HELPING THEM TO GATHER THE INITIAL PAPERWORK, TALK VIRTUALLY TO STAFF AT PARTNER NONPROFIT AGENCIES, AND SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS.   OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS ARE HEARING FROM RESIDENTS IN NEED THAT NAVIGATING THE SYSTEM OF SERVICES IS A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER. DIFFICULTIES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL INCLUDE UNDERSTANDING SERVICE AGENCY CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES, TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS, MISSING DOCUMENTS NEEDED TO ACCESS SERVICES, AND LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN COMMUNICATION OR TECHNOLOGY TO FOLLOW THROUGH.  THE SERVICE AGENCIES ARE THEN FACED WITH PEOPLE COMING TO THEM WHO ARE ALREADY FRUSTRATED, AND WHO MAY BE ON THE OFFENSIVE DUE TO THEIR LACK OF COMFORT WITH THE PROCESS. THE NAVIGATOR TAKES THE CLIENT OUT OF CRISIS MODE AND PROVIDES IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE WHILE SETTING UP THE OTHER SERVICES.  THE INTAKE BARRIER IS THEN REMOVED FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDER.    WE ARE SEEKING TO CALM THE  \u201cSERVICE CHAOS\u201d BY TAKING THE ONUS OF NAVIGATING THE SYSTEM OFF THE CLIENT AND PROVIDING A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OR \u201cBIRDS-EYE VIEW\u201d OF HOW THE SERVICE AGENCIES FIT INTO THE LARGER PICTURE OF THEIR WELL-BEING.  INFORMATION IS OFTEN DISJOINTED AND SOME SERVICES ARE DUPLICATED WHILE OTHERS DON\u2019T EXIST AT ALL TO THE DISMAY OF CLIENTS WHO ARE TRYING TO FIND WHAT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE DAY-TO-DAY.    THE NAVIGATORS EDUCATE CLIENTS, GIVING THEM A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HOSPITALS, MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES, RECOVERY CENTERS, AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES FIT INTO THE LARGER PICTURE OF THEIR WELL-BEING.  THE NAVIGATOR SITS DOWN WITH CLIENTS TO UNDERSTAND AND ASSESS THEIR NEEDS AND SUPPORT NETWORK AND TO MATCH THEM TO SERVICES - HELPING THEM TO GATHER THE INITIAL PAPERWORK, TALK VIRTUALLY TO STAFF AT PARTNER AGENCIES, AND SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS.

IN JANUARY 2021, OREGON HEALTH AUTHORITY PUBLISHED A REPORT ON OREGON\u2019S HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. THE REPORT FOUND THAT IN RURAL AREAS, SPECIFICALLY IN COMMUNITIES ALONG THE OREGON COAST, THERE ARE AREAS OF HIGH-UNMET HEALTHCARE NEED. EVEN PRIOR TO THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19, THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN TILLAMOOK COUNTY, WHICH IS WITHIN CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 5, WAS EXPERIENCING AN ONGOING ACUTE NEED FOR REGISTERED NURSES. NURSING IS A HIGH SKILL, HIGH-WAGE OCCUPATION THAT REQUIRES SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND SERVES AS A CORNERSTONE TO A QUALITY HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. RURAL AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS OF OREGON FACE CHALLENGES IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING THESE HIGH DEMAND PROFESSIONALS. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE STRENGTHEN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE TO DELIVER HEALTHCARE TO UNDERSERVED AREAS. A STRONG LOCAL NURSING DEGREE PROGRAM CAN HELP SUPPORT THIS EFFORT IN TILLAMOOK COUNTY.  IN 2019, TILLAMOOK BAY COMMUNITY COLLEGE COMMISSIONED A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SURVEY TO UNDERSTAND PROGRAMS THE COLLEGE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING IN ORDER TO MEET THE COMMUNITY\u2019S FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS. HEALTHCARE OCCUPATIONS LED THE LIST OF THE EMERGING JOBS IN TILLAMOOK COUNTY. IN INTERVIEWS, FOCUS GROUPS, AND TOWN HALLS, HEALTHCARE OCCUPATIONS DOMINATED THE DISCUSSION. IN PARTICULAR, PEOPLE WANTED TO SEE THE COMMUNITY \u201cGROW OUR OWN,\u201d FROM NURSES AND CNAS TO EMTS, PARAMEDICS, AND TECHNICIANS.

DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN COVID-19 CASES, 20 PERCENT OF HEALTHCARE VISITS CONTINUE TO BE DONE ONLINE. INTERVIEWS WITH UC DAVIS CLINICIANS, PATIENTS, AND FAMILIES INDICATE THAT TELEHEALTH WILL REMAIN A CENTRAL HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SERVICE LINE AFTER THE PANDEMIC.  DIGITAL HEALTH PLATFORMS ARE MUCH MORE THAN TELEHEALTH. DIGITAL HEALTH MOVES HEALTHCARE FROM THE POINT OF CARE TO THE \u201cPOINT OF NEED,\u201d MAKING HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE WHERE THOSE IN NEED ARE, EVERYWHERE THAT HEALTH HAPPENS.  DIGITAL HEALTH PLATFORMS ARE PART OF AN INTEROPERABLE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SPANS HOMES, PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, AND HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS COMMUNITIES.  DIGITAL HEALTH TOOLS ALLOW PROVIDERS, PATIENTS, AND COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE CONTACT AND SHARE DATA IN NEW MORE TIMELY WAYS, ENABLING LESS EXPENSIVE AND MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT PARADIGMS.  THIS FEATURE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE, WHEREBY SPECIALTY SERVICES ARE REGIONALIZED, AND MANY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES DO NOT HAVE NEARBY ACCESS TO NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES.  TELEHEALTH HAS POTENTIAL TO OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHCARE ACCESS INEQUITIES.  THE UC DAVIS DIGITAL HEALTH EQUITY PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.

IN 1989 THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PLACED THE MILL AND THE TAILINGS SITE ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\u2019S NATIONAL PRIORITY LIST FOR CLEANUP AND REMOVAL OF TOXIC WASTE. THE LOCATIONS WERE ULTIMATELY DESIGNATED AS SUPERFUND SITES BY 2000 AND THE US GOVERNMENT SPENT OVER $280 MILLION ON ADDITIONAL CLEANUP.   PRIOR TO THIS, HOWEVER, THE TOXIC WASTE POLLUTED THE AIR AND WATERWAYS IN THE GREATER-MONTICELLO COMMUNITY. THIS LED TO NOTICEABLY HIGH RATES OF CANCER DIAGNOSES, SOME TRAGICALLY RESULTING IN DEATH, WHICH IS WHY SENATORS HATCH AND BENNETT FOUGHT TO BRING MORE RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITY TO BE USED FOR CANCER SCREENING.   IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, THE THEN-SOUTHEAST UTAH DISTRICT HEALTH DEPARTMENT (SEUDHD)ADMINISTERED THE NEWLY-ESTABLISHED CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM MADE POSSIBLE BY THE COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING REQUEST. INDIVIDUALS WOULD CALL OR VISIT THE LOCAL SEUDHD, COMPLETE AN APPLICATION TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY, AND COULD THEN RECEIVE A COUCHER FOR A DOCTOR\u2019S APPOINTMENT AT LOCAL HOSPITALS OR A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IN THE COMMUNITY. TO QUALIFY, INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO LIVE IN THE GREATER MONTICELLO COMMUNITY, WHICH INCLUDED THE BLANDING, ROUGHLY 20 MILES SOUTH OF MONTICELLO, AND MOAB, ABOUT 70 MILES NORTH, BETWEEN 1941-2000.   IF INDIVIDUALS QUALIFIED, THEY COULD RECEIVE A VOUCHER FROM THE SEUDHD T O USE TO PAY FOR A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND THEN FOR A BATTERY OF CANCER SCREENS, NAMELY SKIN CANCERS, LYMPOMA, BREAST CANCER, OR CANCERS OF THE BRAIN. OVER 900 INDIVIDUALS WERE SCREENED FOR CANCER THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, RESULTING IN ABOUT 10% BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER.   THIS PROGRAM WOULD OPERATE SIMILARLY AND BE LED BY SAN JUAN COUNTY GOVERNMENT. INDIVIDUALS WOULD VISIT THE SAN JUAN COUNTY GOVERNMENT BUILDING OR CALL THE LOCAL OFFICE TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. IF THEY ARE, THEY WOULD SHARE THEIR INSURANCE STATUS FOR SAN JUAN COUNTY TO TAKE TO THE LOCAL HOSPITALS AND DETERMINE HOW MUCH THEY WOULD PAY BASED OFF THEIR INSURANCE. SAN JUAN COUNTY WOULD PAY WHATEVER A PATIENT\u2019S INSURANCE DOESN\u2019T COVER FOR BOTH THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND FOR THE CANCER SCREEN. FOR UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS, SAN JUAN COUNTY WOULD PAY THE FULL AMOUNT FOR BOTH (IF NEEDED).

THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE: 1. LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND PUBLIC HEALTH DATA IN RURAL AREAS, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE HEALTH CHALLENGES AND RESPOND TO THEM IN REAL TIME WITH GEOGRAPHICALLY-TARGETED, POPULATION-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES; AS WELL AS LIMITED STRATIFICATION OF DATA TO UNDERSTAND DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HEALTH FACTORS BY RACE, ETHNICITY, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, INCOME LEVEL, GENDER IDENTITY, AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. 2. SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION OF PERSONS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE IN CO-CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS TO HEALTH OUTCOMES AND FACTORS INFL UENCING THEIR HEALTH. 3. MISMATCHES OF SCOPE, TIMING, FUNDING INCENTIVES, AND OTHER DYNAMICS LIMITING THE ABILITY OF RESEARCHERS, STUDENT LEARNERS, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS, SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS\u2019 TO MEANINGFULLY WORK TOGETHER.   4.

THE EXISTING FACILITY WAS CONSTRUCTED IN 1972 AND WAS PURCHASED BY THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN 2006 TO ENSURE A NURSING FACILITY REMAINED IN THE COMMUNITY TO SERVE THOSE IN NEED OF NURSING FACILITY SERVICES.  NEARLY 75% OF THE RESIDENT DAYS AT THE FACILITY ARE COVERED BY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM.    OTHER THAN SOME COSMETIC UPGRADES OVER THE YEARS, THE FACILITY HAS REMAINED TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL 1970S DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.  CURRENTLY, THE FACILITY IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF SEMI-PRIVATE ROOMS, REQUIRING MOST RESIDENTS TO SHARE A ROOM AND BATHROOM.   GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE CURRENT FACILITY IS LOCATED ON MARSH PROPERTY, NECESSITATING FACILITY RESIDENTS TO BE EVACUATED THREE TIMES SINCE 2016 (FOR HURRICANE MATTHEW IN OCTOBER 2016; HURRICANE IRMA IN SEPTEMBER 2017; AND HURRICANE DORIAN IN SEPTEMBER 2019).  GIVEN THE FRAGILE NATURE OF THE RESIDENTS, EVACUATIONS ARE TRAUMATIC AND CONDITIONS AT EMERGENCY FACILITIES ARE NOT UP TO THE STANDARD DESIRED FOR THE RESIDENTS.  IN LIGHT OF THESE FACTORS, THE HEALTH SYSTEM SOUGHT CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING (CDS) FUNDS TO RELOCATE THE SENIOR CARE CENTER \u2013 SAINT MARYS AND CONSTRUCT A REPLACEMENT FACILITY (THE \u201cPROPOSED PROJECT\u201d).  IN THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2022, THE HEALTH SYSTEM WAS AWARDED $5,000,000 FOR THE PROJECT PROJECT.      THE PROP OSED PROJECT RELOCATES THE SENIOR CARE CENTER \u2013 SAINT MARYS FROM ITS CURRENT LOCATION AT 805 DILWORTH STREET IN SAINT MARYS TO PROPERTY OWNED BY THE HEALTH SYSTEM ADJACENT TO THE CAMPUS OF ITS 40-BED ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL AT 2000 DAN PROCTOR DRIVE IN SAINT MARYS.  THE NEW LOCATION IS SIX MILES FROM THE EXISTING LOCATION AND IS NOT ON MARSH PROPERTY.  AT APPROXIMATELY 75,000 SQUARE FEET, THE NEW MODERNIZED FACILITY WILL CONSIST OF 78 PRIVATE ROOMS, EACH WITH ITS OWN PRIVATE BATHROOM.  THE DESIGN ALSO ALLOWS FOR AMPLE SPACE FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A CHAPEL, SALON, DINING AREA, REHABILITATION GYM AND ACTIVITIES ROOMS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIALIZATION AND INTERACTION WITH OTHERS AND THE OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT.  THE NEW FACILITY WILL PROVIDE A SAFE, COMFORTABLE HOME FOR FACILITY RESIDENTS AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SERVICES TO A MAJORITY-MEDICAID RESIDENT POPULATION.

THE PROPOSED RENOVATION WILL EXPAND PROMESA\u2019S INTEGRATED PRIMARY CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CAPACITY BY: 1) INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE EXAM ROOMS FROM THREE TO SIX AND ADDING AN ADDITIONAL COUNSELING ROOM TO THE FOUR EXISTING ROOMS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AREA; 2) IMPROVING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES BY LOCATING THEM IN A DEDICATED SPACE THAT IS SEPARATE FROM ITS METHADONE SERVICES; AND 3) CO-LOCATING AND STRENGTHENING THE INTEGRATION OF PRIMARY CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH GREATER INFORMAL AND FORMAL CARE TEAM INTERACTIONS AND WARM-HAND OFFS BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE IMPROVED STAFF INTERACTION WILL FURTHER ENHANCE INTEGRATED CARE, WHICH IS ALREADY FACILITATED THROUGH SHARED PATIENT INFORMATION USING PROMESA\u2019S UNIFIED ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EHR) SYSTEM, NEXTGEN.

THIS PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH AN ADDICTION MEDICINE FELLOWSHIP AS WELL AS THE CO-LOCATING OF TREATMENT SERVICES FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WHO STRUGGLE WITH ADDICTIONS.  CENTERING PREGNANCY IS A PRENATAL CARE PROGRAM WHERE EXPECTANT MOTHERS LEARN MORE ABOUT PREGNANCY AND HOW TO CARE FOR THE BABY AFTER BIRTH AND RECEIVE REGULAR HEALTHCARE CHECK-UPS FOR THEMSELVES AND THE BABY. EXPECTANT MOTHERS MEET WITH OTHER PREGNANT WOMEN WITH DUE DATES CLOSE TO THEIRS AND A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER BI-WEEKLY FOR 10 WEEKS, WHICH PROVIDES A NETWORK OF SOCIAL SUPPORT, EDUCATIONAL TOOLS AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES. THIS CENTERING PREGNANCY SITE WOULD FOCUS ON MOTHERS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS, SUCH AS HYPERTENSION, DIABETES AND OPIOID USE DISORDER, TO HELP REDUCE INFANT MORTALITY AND ELIMINATE BIRTH OUTCOME INEQUITIES. THE CO-LOCATED FAMILY AND ADDICTION MEDICINE CLINICS WILL ALLOW THESE WOMEN TO RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE CARE AT THIS LOCATION.  THE SPACE WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADDICTION MEDICINE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN YOUNGSTOWN, OH. THIS FELLOWSHIP IS PART OF A LARGER MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM INTENDED TO BRING HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO THE TRI-COUNTY AREA OF COLUMBIANA, MAHONING AND TRUMBULL COUNTIES, OF WHICH MHY IS THE LARGEST HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AND EMPLOYER.   THIS FELLOWSHIP IS A GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (GME) PROGRAM. GME PROGRAMS ARE CLINICAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR MEDICAL SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS AND WANT TO PURSUE MEDICAL EDUCATION IN A SPECIALIZED FIELD. MHY HAS A SUCCESSFUL HISTORY WITH GME PROGRAMS, CURRENTLY PROVIDING NINE UNIQUE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS.   THIS FELLO WSHIP PROGRAM IS ONE YEAR IN LENGTH AND ACCEPTS TWO PHYSICIANS EACH YEAR FOR TRAINING. DURING THEIR FELLOWSHIP, THE PHYSICIANS WILL HELP TO OPERATE A NEW OUTPATIENT ADDICTION MEDICINE CLINIC TO EVALUATE AND TREAT PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A FACULTY MEMBER WHO IS BOARD CERTIFIED IN ADDICTION MEDICINE. GRADUATES OF THIS PROGRAM WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING ADDICTION AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN THIS COMMUNITY AND BEYOND.   THE TRI-COUNTY AREA HAS SUFFERED DECADES OF JOB AND POPULATION LOSSES, WITH HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES THEN OHIO AND MORE THAN A THIRD OF RESIDENTS LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE (COMPARED WITH 13% IN OHIO). THE LOCATION IDENTIFIED FOR THIS PROJECT IS A FORMER VETERAN\u2019S AFFAIRS (VA) CLINIC IN YOUNGSTOWN, LEFT VACANT BY THEIR RELOCATION TO A LARGER FACILITY AT THE END OF 2020.

DOING BUSINESS AS GARDNER HEALTH SERVICES SEEKS TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS AT FOUR HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA'S 19TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, AND ISLAND ITSELF OFF THE GRID TO REINVENT ITS FACILITIES AS MICROGRIDS. WILDFIRES, DECLINING POWER RELIABILITY, AND PG&E ROLLING BLACKOUTS HAVE CAUSED VULNERABILITY TO ITS MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. CINNAMON ENERGY, A REPUTABLE BAY AREA COMPANY SPECIALIZING IN SOLAR SOLUTIONS FOR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, IS THE PROJECT CONTRACTOR. UPON FULL INSTALLATION GARDNER AIMS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CLEAN, RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ENERGY SOURCES.   OBJECTIVES - 1- TO CREATE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ENERGY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND UNDER-RESOURCED COMMUNITIES 2- IMPROVE ENERGY SECURITY FOR THE ORGANIZATION'S HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING MEDICATION AND VACCINE SECURITY AND PRESERVATION 3- IMPROVE ACCESS TO ENERGY 4- MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE 5- BUILD A STRONGER, MORE RESILIENT OPERATION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS 6- REDUCE OPERATING COSTS 7- ADVANCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  IN HEALTHCARE, POWER MEANS LIVES. DURING POWER OUTAGES, GARDNER CURRENTLY USES DIESEL GENERATORS TO POWER ITS INFRASTRUCTURE, CREATING VULNERABILITIES TO THE SYSTEM. GENERATOR RELIABILITY IS LIMITED TO A FINITE NUMBER OF HOURS (4-6HRS). DIESEL ALSO HAS A HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL CARBON FOOTPRINT. HEALTHCARE FACILITIES UTILIZING RENEWABLES STAND OUT FROM THEIR PEERS FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. CONVERTING TO SOLAR POWER CAN REDUCE EACH SITES CARBON EMISSIONS AND HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON EN VIRONMENTAL HEALTH. ADDITIONALLY, SOCIALLY-DRIVEN BUSINESSES ARE ADOPTING A TRIPLE-BOTTOM-LINE APPROACH TO BUSINESS THAT GOES BEYOND MEASURING FINANCIAL RESULTS TO CONSIDERING A COMPANY'S EFFECTS ON PEOPLE, PLANET, AND PROFITS. THIS INCLUDES BETTER COMMUNITY HEALTH, ASSISTANCE IN ACHIEVING GREEN BUILDING CERTIFICATIONS AND, AN ENHANCED REPUTATION. IMPORTANTLY, THE INSTALLATION OF SOLAR-POWERED MICRO GRID SYSTEMS WILL ENABLE THE SITES TO BECOME FULLY SELF-SUFFICIENT, ZERO CARBON FACILITIES. IT WILL BE THE FIRST COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY TO BE A NETWORK OF MICRO GRID SYSTEMS.  INITIALLY GARDNER SOUGHT SOLAR CONVERSION TO REDUCE OPERATING COSTS ACROSS ITS MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. HOWEVER, AS CLIMATE CHANGE HAS HAD DEVASTATING IMPACTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, INCLUDING LOSS OF LIVES DUE TO FIRES, THERE IS AN URGENCY TO CONVERT AS OPERATIONS HAVE FALLEN SUSCEPTIBLE TO PG&E BLACKOUTS. IN 2019, FIRES AND ROLLING BLACK OUTS CAUSED THE EXECUTIVE TEAM TO DIRECT THE RELOCATION OF REFRIGERATED MEDICATIONS AND VACCINES FOR PRESERVATION OUT OF THE COMPRECARE HEALTH CENTER. MOREOVER, STAFF REMAINED VIGILANT THROUGH THE NIGHT OVER THE STATUS OF THE CLINIC'S POWER AND OPERATIONS. GARDNER'S ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES IMPACTS 750 PATIENTS DAILY AND A WORKFORCE OF 600.

MARY\u2019S UNIVERSITY.  THE FLC SERVES PRIMARILY LOW-INCOME CLIENTS FROM CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 20 (TX-20), USING GRADUATE STUDENT INTERNS UNDER SUPERVISION BY EXPERIENCED, LICENSED FACULTY MEMBERS.  IN ADDITION, GRADUATE STUDENT INTERNS PROVIDE SERVICES IN OVER 30 OTHER COMMUNITY AGENCIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. MODERNIZATION OF CLINICAL AREAS OF THE FLC FACILITY INCLUDE: 1) BUILDING EXTERIOR; 2) HEATING, VENTILATION, AND AIR CONDITIONING (HVAC); 3) IMPROVEMENT OF INTERIOR ARRANGEMENTS OF EXISTING FACILITY; AND 4) PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT.  NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED:  THE POPULATION PROFILE OF TX-20 HAS THE GREATEST DISPARITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN THE US.  TX-20 IS WITHIN A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SHORTAGE AREA, AS DESIGNATED BY THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES.  HISPANICS ARE LESS LIKELY TO USE ANY FORM OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE THAN NON-HISPANIC WHITE POPULATION. AMONG HISPANIC ADULTS WHO RECEIVED ANY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE OR PRIMARY CARE WERE THE MOST FREQUENT SOURCES OF TREATMENT. COLLABORATIVE CARE AND INTERNET-BASED MENTAL HEALTH CARE CAN OVERCOME ACCESS AND UTILIZATION BARRIERS FOR THIS POPULATION.   THE FLC IS HOUSED IN A FORMER RESIDENCE OF A RELIGIOUS ORDER, BUILT IN 1958. MUCH OF THE EXISTING HVAC AND BUILDING ENVELOPE ARE ORIGINAL AND IS NOT ADEQUATE FOR SAN ANTONIO WEATHER. ALTHOUGH THE BUILDING MEETS THE STANDARDS OF THE ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS ACT, INSTALLATION OF A REMOTE ENTRY SYSTEM AND WIDENING OF DOORS TO CLINICAL ROOMS WILL ENHANCE CLINICAL SERVICES.   THE PROPOSED SERVICES:  THE CONS TRUCTION MODERNIZATION WILL SUPPORT TRADITIONAL FACE-TO-FACE AND TELE-HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THE UNDERSERVED POPULATION OF TX-20. MODERNIZATION OF THE BUILDING EXTERIOR WILL INCLUDE INSTALLATION OF A REMOTE ENTRY SYSTEM FOR TWO MAIN ENTRIES, AND WEATHERIZATION/STRATEGIC REPLACEMENT OF WINDOWS FOR GREATER ENERGY EFFICIENCY. MODERNIZATION OF HVAC SYSTEMS INCLUDE REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING BOILER (INSTALLED IN 1958) AND EXISTING AC UNIT (INSTALLED IN 1969). IMPROVEMENT OF INTERIOR ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE WIDENING AND REPLACING DOORS OF FIRST FLOOR ROOMS TO ENHANCE ACCESS AND PRIVACY, MODERNIZING WINDOW TREATMENTS FOR GREATER ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND INSTALLATION OF INTERNET LINES AND WIFI ACCESS POINTS TO SUPPORT TELE-HEALTH SERVICES. THE EQUIPMENT PURCHASES WILL SUPPORT TELE-HEALTH SERVICES AND INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY. .  THE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT WILL SUPPORT OUTREACH PROGRAMMING TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITHIN THE DISTRICT TO PROMOTE COLLABORATIVE MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THIS PROGRAM INITIATIVE WILL UTILIZE TELE-HEALTH SERVICES IN PRIMARY CARE OFFICES, SCHOOLS, SENIOR CENTERS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT CAN PROVIDE PRIVATE SPACE.  HALF OF THE COMPUTERS USED FOR TELE-HEALTH SERVICES WILL BE INSTALLED IN THE FAMILY LIFE CENTER WITH THE REMAINDER INSTALLED IN COLLABORATING AGENCIES AND OFFICES.  POPULATION GROUP(S) TO BE SERVED: THE POPULATION PROFILE OF TX-20 IS 69.4% HISPANIC, WITH 25.5% OF CHILDREN UNDER 18 AND 11.2% AGED 65 AND OLDER. OF THE POPULATION OF DISTRICT 20, 23.7% OF HOUSEHOLDS MAKE 125% OR LESS OF THE POVERTY LEVEL.

THERE IS AN URGENT HOUSING SHORTAGE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN NH THAT IS DEPRIVING THESE INDIVIDUALS OF A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT \u2013 A DECENT PLACE OF THEIR OWN TO CALL HOME. THE PROBLEM IS WORSENING AS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH AGING PARENTS, THOSE WHO REQUIRE 24/7 CARE, AND THOSE WITH INADEQUATE FUNDING AND FINANCIAL MEANS TRY TO MEET THE RAISING LIVING COSTS IN NH. AVAILABLE TREATMENT BEDS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN A PERSON\u2019S RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE EXHAUSTED, RESULTING IN NUMEROUS OUT-OF-STATE RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENTS TO FACILITIES IN FLORIDA, PENNSYLVANIA, AND TEXAS. OUT OF STATE PLACEMENT SEPARATES INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OF SUPPORT FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITY THEY RELY ON, WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE SUPPORT THAT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS DOUBLING THE ASSOCIATED COSTS TO CARE FOR THEM.   IT ALSO MAKES MORE SENSE FOR AN ORGANIZATION SUCH AS OURS TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE AS WE CAN ENSURE THAT THESE CHALLENGES ARE MET WITH KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE. ACCESSIBILITY IS JUST ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS TO DEAL WITH: PHYSICAL FACTORS SUCH AS WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE, WIDER DOORWAYS, RAISED ELECTRICAL OUTLETS AND LOWER KITCHEN SURFACES, AND THEN ENSURING THAT THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE IN PLACE WITH THE NECESSARY STAFF.   ANOTHER IMPORTANT MOTIVATION IN CREATING THIS HOUSING IS TO INTEGRATE THESE INDIVIDUALS BACK INTO THE SEACOAST COMMUNITY AND OUT OF AN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING. A MOVE THAT THAT HAS FAR-REACHING BENEFITS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL\u2019S MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING.

THEY DESERVE TO BE RETURNED TO NH WHERE THEY WERE RAISED, CARED FOR AND TO BE BACK IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS QUITE FAMILIAR AND SAFE TO THEM. THE EXORBITANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH KEEPING THESE INDIVIDUALS LIVING OUT OF STATE CAN BE MITIGATED BY CREATING HOUSING THAT IS SUPPORTIVE, AFFORDABLE GREATLY REDUCING THE YEARLY COSTS NOW PAID BY THE STATE WHERE THOSE SAVINGS CAN HELP TO PAY FOR FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS.  LIVING WITHOUT STABILITY AND SECURITY THAT FAMILY AND COMMUNITY CAN PROVIDE - CAN DRASTICALLY EXACERBATE HEALTH CONDITIONS AND PREVENT THOSE CONDITIONS FROM BEING ADDRESSED. MANY OF OUR CLIENTS ALSO EXPERIENCE BEHAVIORAL CRISES AND ARE OFTEN TAKEN TO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS. MOST WILL NOT BE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL BUT WILL REMAIN IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM UNTIL AVAILABLE HOUSING CAN BE FOUND. THESE SITUATIONS CAN TAKE DAYS TO MONTHS TO RESOLVE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT BEDS APPROPRIATE TO THE INDIVIDUAL\u2019S NEEDS. SADLY, THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND ACQUIRED BRAIN DISORDERS WILL SPEND WEEKS AND MONTHS LANGUISHING IN EMERGENCY ROOM LIMBO.

THE DESIGN FOR THE NEW FACILITY BRINGS TOGETHER THREE CORE PROGRAMMING AREAS WITHIN GHS\u2019 CHILDREN\u2019S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAM - THE NCE, AUTISM SERVICES, AND CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES \u2013 ALONG WITH A NEW FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC). THE PROPOSED 60,000 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING WILL BE DESIGNED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF SERVICES AND SUPPORT TO MEET THE ONGOING AND EXPANDING NEEDS OF GENESEE COUNTY\u2019S CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SPECIFICALLY, THE FACILITY WILL INCLUDE SPACES FOR THE AUTISM PROGRAM TO PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART TREATMENT; MODERN OFFICE FACILITIES FOR THE CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF A HIGHLY MOBILE, COMMUNITY- BASED STAFF; AND SPECIALIZED CLINICAL FACILITIES FOR THE NCE TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWING NEED FOR ASSESSMENTS AS WELL AS TO ATTRACT TOP RESEARCHERS.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL PROVIDE: COMPREHENSIVE NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS FOR AT LEAST 750 CHILDREN PER YEAR, MORE THAN DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVED IN THE NCE'S FIRST YEAR; CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR 342 LEAD-AFFECTED FAMILIES, HELPING THEM NAVIGATE MEDICAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND OTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES AS PART OF THEIR CARE PLAN; COMMUNITY OUTREACH, FAMILY NAVIGATION, AND OTHER COMMUNITY SERVICES TO 3,845 RESIDENTS; AND THE ADDITION OF THE FQHC WILL IMPROVE THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR PATIENTS AS WELL AS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF PRIMARY CARE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, AND DENTAL SERVICES.  ESTABLISHING THE GHS CENTER FOR CHILDREN'S INTEGRATED SERVICES WILL ALLOW FAMILIES TO COME TO ONE SINGLE LOCATION FOR ALL OF THEIR CHILDREN'S TREATMENT AND SUPPORT NEEDS. THIS COMPREHENSIVE BUILDING WILL SAVE FAMILIES TIME, REDUCE TRANSPORTATION CONCERNS, AND ALLOW FOR BETTER CARE COORDINATION. FAMILIES THAT MAY HAVE OTHERWISE NOT BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE DIFFERENT TREATMENT OPTIONS BECAUSE OF TIME AND/OR TRANSPORTATION CONCERNS WILL NOW BE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN SERVICES, ALLOWING MORE CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c88fdb47-ec39-9ce4-97a7-02e633961653-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_CE147250_7526"}, {"internal_id": 152371227, "Award ID": "CE147249", "Award Amount": 0.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-15", "CFDA Number": "93.493", "Description": "COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING/CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING - CONSTRUCTION - THE GATEWAY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER, INC., (GCHC) PROPOSED WEST CLINIC LOCATED AT 1702 LAFAYETTE ST., IS SITUATED ALONG THE U.S. \u2013 MEXICO BORDER AND IS MAINLY COMPRISED OF LOW-INCOME MINORITY POPULATIONS. LAREDO, TEXAS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (HRSA) AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE (HPSA) AND A MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA (MUA) AND MAKES UP ABOUT 14.8%  OF THE ENTIRE WEBB COUNTY POPULATION. ABOUT 82.6% OF THE RESIDENTS LIVING IN THE VICINITY OF THE PROPOSED WEST SIDE CLINIC ARE LIVING BELOW THE 200% POVERTY LEVEL AND ARE UNINSURED. MANY OF THE RESIDENTS LIVING IN THIS AREA FACE VARIOUS HEALTH BARRIERS LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND FINANCIAL ISSUES. THESE INDIVIDUALS ALSO SUFFER FROM MISINFORMATION AND APPREHENSION WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR RESIDENTS TO SEEK AND RECEIVE PROPER HEALTHCARE. IN THE PAST YEAR, ABOUT 28.7% OF THE TARGET POPULATION DELAYED OR REFUSED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COSTS.   GCHC IS ONE OF THE LEADING PRIMARY HEALTHCARE CLINICS SERVING THE TRI-COUNTY REGION OF WEBB, ZAPATA, AND JIM HOGG COUNTY IN SOUTH TEXAS. THROUGH ITS CLINICS AND THE PROPOSED GATEWAY CHC WEST CLINIC, GCHC HOPES TO ALLEVIATE THE HEALTH ISSUES PLAGUING THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES BY OFFERING A WIDE ARRAY OF MEDICAL CARE SERVICES PROVIDED BY PHYSICIANS AND/OR MID-LEVEL PRACTITIONERS. PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDE PRENATAL CARE, IMMUNIZATIONS, DIABETES AWARENESS AND DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT COURSES, EDUCATION PROGRAMS, CANCER SCREENING PROGRAMS, AND FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES. SUPPORT SERVICES INCLUDE PHARMACY, X-RAYS, AND LABORATORY TESTS. IN AN EFFORT TO CONTINUE ITS GOAL OF CREATING A ONE-STOP-SHOP FOR HEALTHCARE IN THE TRI-COUNTY REGION, GCHC HAS ALSO ADDED PREVENTIVE AND RESTORATIVE DENTAL CARE TO ITS LIST OF PREEMPTIVE SERVICES AS WELL AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES.

CURRENTLY, ABOUT 16% OF THE TOTAL GCHC REGISTERED PATIENT POPULATION RESIDES IN THIS AREA. THUS GCHC\u2019S PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS IMPERATIVE FOR THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITY. GCHC PROPOSES TO CONSTRUCT A 5,000 SQUARE FOOT CLINIC, CAPABLE OF MEETING THE COMMUNITY NEEDS. THE LOCATION SELECTED FOR THIS PROJECT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONS AS A PARKING LOT AND MEASURES ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF AN ACRE (34,692 SQ. FT.). THE CLINIC WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE NECESSARY MEDICAL SPACES, EQUIPMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY SUITED FOR ALL SERVICES PROVIDED. IT WILL ALSO BE OUTFITTED WITH THE NECESSARY ANTIMICROBIAL SAFETY FEATURES (WALL PAINTS, TILES, VENTILATION SYSTEMS) THAT PROTECT THE STRUCTURE AGAINST A BROAD SPECTRUM OF BACTERIA, MOLD AND MILDEW. THESE MODIFICATIONS WILL ACCOMMODATE THE HOSPITAL GRADE STANDARDS OF CLEANLINESS AND ARE IN A DIRECT RESPONSE TO REDUCE CONTAGION OF COVID-19 AND OTHER VIRUSES.

HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF OUR GROWTH, WE ARE IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL SPACE IN ORDER TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS. ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES FOR THE PROJECT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONATED.   THE EXPANSION OF THE FREE CLINIC OF MERIDIAN BUILDING IS NECESSARY DUE TO THE GROWING PATIENT POPULATION.  THE CLINIC SERVES ADULTS WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID OR MEDICARE AND WHO EARN 200% OR LESS OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.  THE PATIENT POPULATION HAS GROWN FROM A FEW HUNDRED IN 2014 TO MORE THAN 1200 IN 2022.  MOST OF OUR PATIENTS ARE EMPLOYED IN LOW-PAYING JOBS THAT DO NOT OFFER MEDICAL INSURANCE.  WE PROVIDE PRIMARY HEALTHCARE AND REFERRALS FOR SPECIALIZED CARE.  THE EXISTING CLINIC HAS FOUR EXAM ROOMS AND A SMALL LAB.  THE DAILY VOLUNTEER MEDICAL STAFF GENERALLY CONSISTS OF TWO PHYSICIANS AND SEVERAL NURSES AND/OR MEDICAL ASSISTANTS.  THE ADDITION OF TWO EXAM ROOMS AND THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE EXISTING LAB WOULD ALLOW US TO SEE MORE PATIENTS PER DAY IN A MORE EFFICIENT TIMEFRAME.

THE ADDITIONAL MULTI-USE ROOM WOULD PROVIDE SPACE FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY, MENTAL HEALTH TH ERAPY, AND OTHER SPECIALIZED NEEDS.  THE FREE CLINIC SERVES PATIENTS IN EIGHT RURAL COUNTIES OF EAST MISSISSIPPI AND WEST ALABAMA.  THE PERCENTAGE OF UNINSURED ADULTS IN THOSE COUNTIES RANGES FROM 16.6% TO 22.1%.  THOSE LIVING BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL RANGES FROM 22% TO 22.7%.   THE FREE CLINIC OF MERIDIAN FOCUSES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESSES WHICH REQUIRE CONSISTENT CARE.  IN OUR SERVICE AREA, RESIDENTS DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES RANGES FROM 12.8% TO 15.4%; HYPERTENSION 34.2% TO 46.3%; AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL 34.8% TO 42%, ALL OF WHICH ARE RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE WHICH IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN BOTH MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA.

COUNTY LEADERS SUPPORT A CONTINUUM OF CRISIS SERVICES WITH STRONG JUSTICE-BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS. THE RENOVATION PROJECT SEEKS TO MEET GROWING COMMUNITY NEEDS.  THE DESIGN AND SPACE ARE NOT CONDUCIVE TO THE GROWTH OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES PROVIDED AT THE CENTER. THIS LOCATION OFFERS 24/7 EMERGENCY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH/ASSESSMENT SERVICES AND PROVIDES AN ARRAY OF OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS/HEALTH PROMOTION SERVICES. RENOVATION IS NEEDED TO SUSTAIN AND EXPAND OPERATIONS AS THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMMING CHANGES SINCE THE OPENING OF THE BUILDING IN 2016.   THE REDESIGN WILL EXPAND THE CAPACITY FOR SERVING INDIVIDUALS IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING. THE RENOVATIONS WILL PROVIDE PROPER DESIGN TO ADDRESS A GAP IN OUR CONTINUUM OF CRISIS SERVICES BY IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM TO DE-ESCALATE INDIVIDUALS\u2019 LEVEL OF DISTRESS AND PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT/INPATIENT/RESIDENTIAL LEVEL OF CARE. THIS 23-HOUR PROGRAM IS TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISES ARE SERVED IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING. OFTEN THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE LONG WAIT TIMES IN BUSY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, WHICH IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO MEETING THEIR IMMEDIATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. THIS MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE INCLUDES LAW ENFORCEM ENT, PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS, NURSES, AND CLINICIANS AND REQUIRES AN EFFICIENT SPACE. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS THAT HAVE EMERGED AT THE CENTER AND WILL BE NEEDED FOR THE 23-HOUR PROGRAM THE RENOVATIONS WILL HELP PROVIDE THE PROPER DESIGN TO BEST IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM.  THE CENTER IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE COUNTY\u2019S CRISIS CONTINUUM. A COMMUNITY THE SIZE OF FAIRFAX (1.2 MILLION RESIDENTS) REQUIRES MULTIPLE SERVICES ALONG A CONTINUUM TO ENSURE EQUITABLE CRISIS RESPONSE AND LINKAGE TO SERVICES. THE COUNTY LAUNCHED ITS DIVERSION FIRST INITIATIVE IN 2016. DIVERSION FIRST PROVIDES ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, CO-OCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS, OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, WHO ENCOUNTER THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR LOW-LEVEL OFFENSES. THE GOAL IS TO INTERCEDE AND PROVIDE ASSESSMENT, TREATMENT OR NEEDED SUPPORT TO PREVENT REPEATED ENCOUNTERS WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, PROMOTE A SAFER COMMUNITY, AND ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY.   DIVERSION FIRST PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE COUNTY AS IT IS FAR MORE COST-EFFECTIVE TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY THAN TO INCARCERATE THEM. IT COSTS APPROXIMATELY $181 PER DAY TO HOLD AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE ADULT DETENTION CENTER. BY CONTRAST, IT COSTS $60 PER DAY TO PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AND $21 PER DAY TO PROVIDE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE DAILY SAVINGS FROM AVOIDING A HOSPITALIZATION IS $959 PER INDIVIDUAL.  THE CENTER IS A KEY COMPONENT OF DIVERSION FIRST. THIS PROJECT WILL ENHANCE THE COUNTY\u2019S SIGNIFICANT LOCAL INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITY-BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS SERVICES.

WHEN CHCB COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF CIHC IN 2016, THE APPROXIMATELY 2,000 SQUARE FOOT LOWER LEVEL OF THE FACILITY WAS RESERVED FOR THE FUTURE HOME OF A DENTAL CENTER, TO BE COMPLETED AT A TIME WHEN A FUNDING OPPORTUNITY AROSE. NOW IS THAT TIME! THE FUNDS FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE UTILIZED TO TRANSFORM THE PRE-EXISTING SPACE INTO A DENTAL PRACTICE THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIVE DENTAL OPERATORIES; A LAB AND STERILIZATION ROOM; PATIENT WAITING AREA; STORAGE AREAS; AND STAFF AREAS SUCH AS A COLLABORATIVE OFFICE, A CHANGING AREA, BREAK ROOM, AND RESTROOM.  ESTABLISHED IN 2004, CHCB\u2019S DENTAL PROGRAM IS THE SOLE POINT OF ACCESS TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE DENTAL SERVICES FOR OVER 7,000 VERMONTERS ANNUALLY; HOWEVER, ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE IS EXTREMELY LIMITED IN VERMONT\u2019S CHAMPLAIN ISLANDS. GRAND ISLE COUNTY IS THE ONLY COUNTY IN VERMONT WITH NO REPORTED DENTAL PRACTICE. TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES TO ACCESS DENTAL CARE PRESENTS A BURDEN TO THE RESIDENTS OF SOUTH HERO, NORTH HERO, AND GRAND ISLE, THE TOWNS THAT COMPRISE SOUTHERN GRAND ISLE COUNTY. APPROXIMATELY 30% OF RESIDENTS IN THIS REGION ARE AGED 60 YEARS AND OVER (US CENSUS ACS 2019), SO THERE ARE ISSUES OF TRANSPORTATION AND FINANCIAL MEANS.

IN FACT, APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE POPULATION OF SOUTHERN GRAND ISLE COUNTY IS CONSIDERED LOW-INCOME (BELOW 200% FPL). GRAND ISLE IS ALSO HOME TO A LARGE POPULATION OF MIGRANT WORKERS WHO OFTEN HAVE LITTLE TO NO ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION.

STROKE IS RECOGNIZED AS THE FOURTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG AMERICANS, AS WELL AS A LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY.  BEGINNING IN AUGUST OF 2014, THE HOUSTON FIRE DEPARTMENT EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES COORDINATED AND COLLABORATED IN AN AGGRESSIVE RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THE HOUSTON STROKE CONSORTIUM TO IMPROVE THE CARE OF PERSONS SUFFERING FROM STROKES DURING THE FIRST MOMENTS OF THEIR CONTACT WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.   THE GOAL WAS TO TREAT ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WITH THE CLOT DISSOLVING MEDICATION, TPA, AND HOPEFULLY REVERSE THE STROKE BEFORE IT CAUSES PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE.  THE STUDY ENROLLED 1,047 TPA-ELIGIBLE PATIENTS, 617 IN THE MOBILE STROKE UNIT (MSU) GROUP AND 430 IN STANDARD MANAGEMENT (SM).  AMONG TPA ELIGIBLE PATIENTS, 97% WERE TREATED WITH TPA IN THE MSU GROUP AND 80% IN THE SM GROUP. TIME FROM LAST KNOWN NORMAL (LKN) TO TPA TREATMENT WAS SHORTER IN THE MSU GROUP COMPARED TO SM. IMPORTANTLY, 33% OF MSU AND 3% OF SM PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITHIN 60 MIN OF LKN.  COMPARED TO SM, THE MSU GROUP HAD A MORE FAVORABLE NEUROLOGIC OUTCOME SCORE AND THE PROPORTION NORMAL OR NEAR-NORMAL WAS 10% HIGHER (53% MSU VERSUS 43% SM).  THIS MEANS THAT ON AVERAGE, FOR EVERY 100 PATIENTS TREATED ON A MOBILE STROKE UNIT RATHER THAN STANDARD CARE, 27 WILL HAVE LESS FINAL NEUROLOGIC DISABILITY AND 11 OF THE 27 WILL BE DISABILITY-FREE.  THE CHALLENGE CREATED: ALL PERSONS IN THE CITY OF HOUSTON WHO SUFFER AN ACUTE STROKE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE SUPERIOR CARE AND ACHIEVE THE SUPERIOR OUTCOMES AFFORDED BY THE CARE AVAILABLE WITH  A MOBILE STROKE UNIT. THIS COMMUNITY-BASED MSU PROGRAM PROMOTES EQUITY IN ALL DEMOGRAPHIC AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE CITY OF HOUSTON: 1) COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COVID-19 (LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS, MINORITIES, DISCONNECTED YOUTH, UNEMPLOYED VETERANS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES), 2) NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTED POPULATIONS AND 3) GROUPS HISTORICALLY AND MARGINALIZED BY HEALTH DISPARITIES. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL OF CARE ACROSS THE CITY, MULTIPLE SUCH MSU\u2019S WILL BE NEEDED.  EACH MSU COVERS AN AREA OF ~154 SQUARE MILES.  THE CITY OF HOUSTON ENCOMPASSES AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 620 SQUARE MILES.  THEREFORE, FOUR MSU AMBULANCES ARE REQUIRED TO COVER THE GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORY OF THE CITY OF HOUSTON.  CURRENTLY ONLY ONE MSU IS IN OPERATION WITHIN THE CITY OF HOUSTON / 620 SQUARE MILES.  THUS, THE ASK OF AN ADDITIONAL MSU WOULD ALLOW MORE STROKE PATIENTS TO BE TREATED EACH DAY.  THE SOLUTION OFFERED: HAVE THE CITY OF HOUSTON PROVIDED UP TO FOUR MSU\u2019S AND ONE IN RESERVE, AS WELL AS PARAMEDIC STAFFING WHILE THE MSU CONSORTIUM CONTINUES TO PROVIDE NEURO-CRITICAL CARE NURSE AND CT TECHNICIAN STAFFING AS WELL AS TPA, TELERADIOLOGY AND TELENEUROLOGY.    CONCLUSION: THIS NOVEL MODEL IN THE CITY OF HOUSTON, IS DELIVERING ACUTE STROKE TREATMENT AND ADVANCING CARE ON THE STREETS, WHICH COULD HAVE A POTENTIAL IMPACT ACROSS THE NATION.  WHEN PATIENTS WHO QUALIFY FOR TPA COMPARED TO STANDARD BY EMS ARE EVALUATED, IMAGED AND TREATED IN THE PRE-HOSPITAL SETTING, THE DATA SUGGESTS A SAVING OF A CRITICAL-HOUR AND FEWER LONG-TERM DISABILITIES, IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE AND REDUCTION IN OVERALL HEALTHCARE COSTS.

(NRHA) BEGAN SERVICE IN 1978.  IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE LOCAL UMWA CHAPTER AND CONTINUES TO OPERATE A BLACK LUNG CLINIC TODAY.  BASED ON THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE SERVICE AREA AND LACK OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES, ADDITIONAL SERVICES WERE ADDED.  NRHA HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.  UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO THE DECLINE OF THE COAL INDUSTRY AND LOCAL POPULATIONS, MANY OF NRHA\u2019S CURRENT LOCATIONS ARE NOW LOCATED IN SPARSELY POPULATED AREAS.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  NRHA, A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC), LOCATED IN FAYETTE COUNTY RECENTLY PURCHASED A FORMER KMART BUILDING LOCATED IN OAK HILL, WEST VIRGINIA ON ROUTE 19, A MAJOR NORTH/SOUTH CORRIDOR THROUGH SOUTH CENTRAL WEST VIRGINIA.  THIS BUILDING HAS BEEN EMPTY FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS.  WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ZMM ARCHITECTS, NRHA HAS DESIGNED THE SPACE INTO A LARGE MEDICAL COMPLEX, AS WELL AS A COMMUNITY CONFERENCE CENTER.  A WEST VIRGINIA BASED GENERAL CONTRACTOR HAS BEEN CHOSEN FOR THE PROJECT.  THE MEDICAL COMPLEX WILL ALLOW NRHA TO COMBINE SERVICES IN ONE LOCATION, AND ALSO ALLOW NRHA TO EXPAND ON THE SERVICES, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY OFFERED, TO A MULTITUDE OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY.  SERVICES WILL INCLUDE MEDICAL, WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH, DENTAL, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, PHARMACY, WITH A DRIVE THROUGH WINDOW, MEDICATION ASSISTANCE TREATMENT (MAT) SERVICES, PULMONARY AND CARDIAC REHABILITATION, CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES, VISION, RADIOLOGY, DIABETES EDUCATION, AND URGENT CARE SERVICES.  POTENTIAL TENANT SERVICES INCLUDE A LAB DRAWING FA CILITY, A PHYSICAL THERAPY PROVIDER, A COFFEE SHOP, AND SPACE FOR ROTATING SPECIALISTS FROM REGIONAL TERTIARY HOSPITALS.  THE CONFERENCE CENTER, WHICH WILL INCLUDE A FULL SERVICE KITCHEN, WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR LARGE AND SMALL EVENTS.  THE LOCATION IS MUCH MORE VISIBLE AND CONVENIENT THAN NRHA'S CURRENT LOCATIONS, AND THE MORE THAN 400 PARKING SPACES ALLOWS FOR AMPLE FREE PARKING FOR NRHA PATIENTS.  THE MEDICAL COMPLEX\u2019S LOCATION ON ROUTE 19, IN THE HEART OF FAYETTE COUNTY, WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO AND AWARENESS OF NRHA\u2019S SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY.  THE MEDICAL COMPLEX LOCATION IS ALSO A STOP FOR THE MOUNTAIN TRANSIT AUTHORITY, ALLOWING INCREASED ACCESSIBILITY OF NRHA\u2019S SERVICES TO THE CITIZENS OF FAYETTE COUNTY.  OUR CURRENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT SHOWS THAT ALMOST 10% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS IN FAYETTE COUNTY LACK A MOTOR VEHICLE.  AS AN FQHC, NRHA PROVIDES CARE TO ALL IN NEED, REGARDLESS OF ONE\u2019S INSURANCE COVERAGE OR THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR SERVICES. THE COMMUNITY OF FAYETTE COUNTY, AS WELL AS THE CITIES OF OAK HILL AND FAYETTEVILLE, ARE INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROJECT AND THE OPPORTUNITIES IT WILL BRING TO THE COMMUNITY.  EVERYONE, INCLUDING NEARBY BUSINESSES, AGREE THAT THE CREATION OF THE MEDICAL COMPLEX WILL BE A GREAT ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS TRANSFORM A LONG TIME, LARGE, VACANT, BUILDING, INTO A THRIVING HEALTH CARE FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH NRHA\u2019S LONG STANDING REPUTATION AS A QUALITY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IN FAYETTE COUNTY.  NOT ONLY WILL THE VACANT BUILDING BE TRANSFORMED, BUT THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES THIS OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY.

WE WERE CREATED BY COMMUNITY LEADERS AND THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD WITH THE BELIEF THAT ALL CHILDREN DESERVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND THE CHANCE TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL. SINCE THEN, WE\u2019VE GROWN TO A TOTAL OF EIGHT CLINIC SITES IN LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES ACROSS ADAMS COUNTY. WE ARE PARTICULARLY COMMITTED TO THE RESIDENTS OF COMMERCE CITY AS IT CONTINUES TO BE AMONG THE HIGHEST NEED COMMUNITIES IN METRO DENVER. EIGHTY-FOUR PERCENT OF LOCAL STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE/REDUCED LUNCHES, 91% IDENTIFY AS A RACIAL OR ETHNIC MINORITY AND PER CAPITAL INCOME IS APPROXIMATELY $19,000 (STATEWIDE RATE: $38,226). CLOSE TO 20% OF KIDS FIRST PATIENTS ARE UNINSURED (STATEWIDE RATE: 4.3%), AND APPROXIMATELY 80% ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID OR CHILD HEALTH PLAN PLUS (STATEWIDE RATE: 40%).   UNDER A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, KIDS FIRST LEADERSHIP DETERMINED IT WAS TIME FOR A NEW COMMERCE CITY PEDIATRIC HEALTH CLINIC THAT COULD MORE EFFECTIVELY DELIVER CARE THAT MEETS LOCAL NEEDS. KIDS FIRST\u2019S CURRENT CLINIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES HAVE OCCUPIED THE SAME 2,000 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING FOR 32 YEARS WITH FEW UPGRADES OR RENOVATIONS.

A NEW COMBINATION RADIOLOGY/FLUOROSCOPY (LIVE X-RAY) IMAGING SYSTEM, HELPS TO FULFILL THIS MISSION BY GAINING STANDARDIZATION OF PATIENT CARE. FLUOROSCOPY IS A MEDICAL IMAGING PROCEDURE THAT USES SEVERAL PULSES OF AN X-RAY BEAM TO SHOW INTERNAL ORGANS AND TISSUES MOVING IN REAL TIME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN. STANDARD X-RAYS ARE LIKE PHOTOGRAPHS, WHEREAS FLUOROSCOPY IS LIKE A VIDEO. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS USE FLUOROSCOPY FOR TWO MAIN PURPOSES: FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES AND TO HELP GUIDE CERTAIN TREATMENT PROCEDURES (KNOWN AS INTERVENTIONAL GUIDANCE), SUCH AS SURGERIES AND CATHETER PLACEMENTS. THE NEW EQUIPMENT ALLOWS FOR CONSISTENT HIGH QUALITY OF CARE, FEWER RETAKES, AND FASTER IMAGE INTERPRETATION TIMES.  IT ALLOWS DKH TO SAVE COSTS, TIME, ENHANCE ROOM AVAILABILITY, AND PROMOTE GREATER SATISFACTION FOR PATIENTS, STAFF, PHYSICIANS, AND MANAGERS. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE ARE THE PRIMARY REASONS TO REPLACE DAY KIMBALL\u2019S EXISTING UNIT. CURRENTLY THE IMAGING DEPARTMENT IS NOT ABLE TO PERFORM FLUOROSCOPY PROCEDURES SUCH AS VCUG (VOIDING CYST URETHROGRAM, AN X-RAY EXAMINATION OF A CHILD'S BLADDER AND URINARY TRACT) PROCEDURES. THE CURRENT UNIT DOES NOT HAVE COMPATIBLE STIRRUP ATTACHMENT; REQUIRING A WORK AROUND BY USING SANDBAGS. ANOTHER BENEFIT WOULD BE THE OB-GYN PROVIDERS COULD COME TO THE DEPARTMENT TO PERFORM THE VCUG. SERVICES SUCH AS ARTHROGRAMS (EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS OF JOINTS CONDITION) COULD BE PERFORMED BECAUSE OF THE PHYSICAL LAYOUT OF THE COMBINATION FLUOROSCOPY/RADIOLOGY SYSTEM. NEW FLUOROSCOPY EQUIPMENT HAS INTUITIVE INTERFACE THAT BENEFITS BOTH THE PHYSICIAN AND TECHNICAL STAFF FOR EASE OF USE.  THE RADIATION SAFETY OFFICER (RSO) CONTRACTED BY DKH HAS ISSUED AN ALARA 1- (AS LOW AS REASONABLY ACHIEVABLE) WARNING FOR A STAFF RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGIST WHO HAS EXCEEDED THE RECOMMENDED THRESHOLD OF RADIATION DO SE. IF THE CURRENT FLUOROSCOPY SYSTEM IS NOT REPLACED, THERE MAY BE AN INCREASE IN STAFF MEMBERS RECEIVING ALARA 1 WARNINGS. A STATE OF THE ART FLUOROSCOPY IMAGING SYSTEM MAKES IT EASY TO ADHERE TO THE ALARA1 PRINCIPLE. THERE ARE SPECIAL APPLICATIONS AND SOFTWARE TO ASSIST WITH KEEPING RADIATION DOSES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE, WHILE ALL ANATOMICAL DETAILS REMAIN IN CLEAR IMAGES TO MAKE CONFIDENT DIAGNOSTIC DECISIONS FOR ALL PATIENTS. THE JOINT COMMISSION, ORGANIZATION THAT ACCREDITS MORE THAN 22,000 HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, SETS A STANDARD THAT REQUIRES FLUOROSCOPY EQUIPMENT TO DISPLAY AND RECORD A PATIENT\u2019S DOSE. CURRENTLY, DKH STAFF ARE RECORDING EACH CASE; EACH PATIENT\u2019S DOSE, TIME, AND NUMBER OF IMAGES MANUALLY. THIS MUST THEN BE DOCUMENTED BY THE PHYSICIAN IN THE PATIENT\u2019S SCAN AND/OR MEDICAL RECORD.  THIS DATA MUST ALSO BE EASILY RETRIEVABLE (PER STANDARD). WITH OUR CURRENT SYSTEM, THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR PATIENTS TO RECEIVE INCREASED DOSE. BY ONLY RECORDING THE INFORMATION BY HAND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TRACK AND COMPARE DATA TO HELP MINIMIZE/REDUCE EXPOSURES. THIS IS WHERE DOSE TRACKING AND OPTIMIZATION SOFTWARE COMES INTO PLAY. A NEW FLUOROSCOPY SYSTEM WOULD ALLOW THE RADIOLOGY TO COMPARE THE DAY KIMBALL DOSES AGAINST OTHER COMPARABLE FACILITIES. MANUALLY ENTERED DOSES INTO A PATIENTS RECORD ALSO MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT OR NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK A PATIENT\u2019S LIFETIME DOSE HISTORY. THE JOINT COMMISSION REQUIRES THAT THE RSO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND TRACK IMPROVEMENTS. THE DKH RADIATION SAFETY OFFICER STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THE NEED FOR THE MOVE TO A MORE ADVANCED PIECE OF EQUIPMENT FOR REASONS STATED ABOVE. THIS IS A STANDARD OF CARE THAT OTHER AREA CONNECTICUT HOSPITALS HAVE MET.  A NEW FLUOROSCOPY SYSTEM WOULD HELP REDUCE THE NEED FOR REPEAT EXPOSURES, SAVING TIME AND IMPROVING SAFETY.

CHILDREN LIVING IN MCLEAN COUNTY, ILLINOIS ARE NO DIFFERENT.  17 PERCENT OF KINDERGARTENERS, 16.5 PERCENT OF SECOND GRADERS, AND 10.5 PERCENT OF SIXTH GRADERS HAD UNTREATED DENTAL CARIES NOTED ON THEIR 2013/2014 DENTAL EXAM.  THE COUNTY\u2019S LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE HIGHEST NON-COMPLIANCE RATES FOR ORAL EXAMS AND TRENDS MORE UNFAVORABLY FROM KINDERGARTEN TO SIXTH GRADE.  SADLY, LACK OF DENTAL CARE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE TOP 5 HEALTH ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS SINCE 2014.    50 PERCENT OF MCLEAN COUNTY\u2019S MEDICAID RECIPIENTS HAVE NEVER SEEN A DENTIST.  THE AVERAGE COST OF A MEDICAID ENROLLEE\u2019S INPATIENT HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR DENTAL PROBLEMS IS NEARLY TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN THE COST OF PREVENTIVE CARE DELIVERED IN A DENTIST\u2019S OFFICE. EVIDENCE INDICATES A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POOR ORAL HEALTH AND POOR HEALTH AND HEALTH OUTCOMES.   LOWER INCOME, UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE LESS PREVENTIVE ORAL HEALTH CARE AND ARE FREQUENTLY DIAGNOSED AT MORE ADVANCED STATES OF DISEASE THAN THOSE WITH INSURANCE AND ORAL HEALTH COVERAGE.  ADDITIONALLY, UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE FEWER PREVENTIVE SERVICES, ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE REGULAR CARE, AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TREATED FOR AN ORAL HEALTH PROBLEM THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.  IN MCLEAN COUNTY, 19.3% OF THE POPULATION IS UNINSURED.  IN ADDITION, 14.5% OF COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE LIVING BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AT THE 50TH \u2013 75TH PERCENTILE RANGE, THIS RATE IS THE WORST COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTIES IN ILLINOIS.    IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE IN MCLEAN COUNTY, THERE ARE 65 DENTISTS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS. THIS RATIO IS WORSE THAN THE ILLINOIS RATIO (75 DENTISTS/100,000)    (CONDUENT HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS, 2016).  CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.

WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE MEDICAL AND DENTAL COMMUNITIES, CHESTNUT RENOVATED AND EXPANDED ITS ADJACENT BUILDING LOCATED AT 702 WEST CHESTNUT STREET IN 2019.  THIS 32,000 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING NOW HOUSES CHESTNUT\u2019S STATE-OF-THE-ART FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER.  CHESTNUT DESIRES TO REPURPOSE ITS ORIGINAL SPACE LOCATED AT 720 WEST CHESTNUT STREET TO ADD A DENTAL SERVICE OFFERING FOR THE UNDERSERVED POPULATION OF MCLEAN COUNTY AND SEEKS $430,000 IN CAPITAL SUPPORT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION.

RNA IS THE GENETIC MATERIAL THAT BRIDGES DNA AND PROTEINS IN ALL LIVING CELLS AND CARRIES THE GENETIC INFORMATION FOR MANY VIRUSES, INCLUDING SARS-COV-2. RNA CAN BE MANIPULATED TO CONTROL THE FUNCTION OF A CELL, BUILD NANOSTRUCTURES, DEVELOP TREATMENTS FOR DISEASE, AND SERVE AS BIOMARKERS TO REPORT ON HUMAN HEALTH. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ELEVATED THE IMPORTANCE OF RNA, AS THE GENETIC MATERIAL BEHIND BOTH THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS AND THE COVID-19 VACCINE. THE REQUESTED NEXT GENERATION TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE ARE CRITICAL TOOLS IN THE INSTITUTE\u2019S BATTLE AGAINST SARS-COV-2, THEIR CONTINUING RESEARCH INTO RNA AND ITS ROLE IN IMPROVING HUMAN HEALTH AND COMBATING DISEASES, SUCH AS THE LEADING CAUSE OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AND AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS. THE REQUESTED ITEMS REPRESENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE HELPED REVOLUTIONIZE THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY AND HUMAN HEALTH. FIRST, THE XEVO TQ ABSOLUTE IS A LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY TANDEM QUADRUPOLE MASS SPECTROMETER, WHICH COMBINES THE SEPARATING POWER OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY WITH THE HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SELECTIVE MASS ANALYSIS CAPABILITY OF QUADRUPOLE MASS SPECTROMETRY. THIS VERSATILE, ROBUST, AND SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT IS USED FOR DETECTING NEARLY ALL SMALL MOLECULES AND IS THE ONLY CURRENT TECHNIQUE THAT CAN DIRECTLY AND COMPREHENSIVELY CHARACTERIZE CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS IN RNA. THIS SYSTEM WILL PERMIT THE ANALYSIS OF RNA AND OTHER SMALL MOLECULES INVOLVED IN CELLULAR BIOLOGY AND THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREA TMENTS OF MANY DISEASES.  SECOND, THE LSM980 ADVANCED CONFOCAL IMAGING SYSTEM ENABLES REAL-TIME TRACKING OF RNA AND PROTEINS IN A CELL, ORGANOID, OR WHOLE ORGANISM AT SUPER RESOLUTION IN REAL-TIME. BY LETTING RESEARCHERS VIEW HOW MOLECULES ARE AFFECTED BY MUTATIONS, VIRAL INFECTIONS, AND/OR DRUGS THE SYSTEM WILL AID IN THE DESIGN OF NEW DRUGS AND TREATMENTS FOR MANY CURRENT AND EMERGING DISEASES. THIRD, THE AFFINITY ISOTHERMAL CALORIMETRY (ITC) PROVIDES UNMATCHED QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF BIOMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS WITH UNPARALLELED SAMPLE REPRODUCIBILITY, THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY AND RELIABILITY. THE SYSTEM\u2019S ABILITY TO CHARACTERIZE LIGAND-PROTEIN, LIGAND-RNA AND LIGAND-DNA BINDING AFFINITY AND THERMODYNAMICS IS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN RNA, DNA, PROTEINS, AND SMALL MOLECULES THERAPEUTICS. THE SYSTEM WILL AID IN ADVANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BIOMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS INVOLVED IN CRITICAL CELLULAR FUNCTIONS AS WELL IN THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF DRUGS TO TREAT HUMAN DISEASES. AS A PACKAGE, THESE THREE ADVANCED INSTRUMENT SYSTEMS WILL ALLOW RNA INSTITUTE RESEARCHERS TO TRACK AND EXAMINE RNA AND OTHER BIOMOLECULES AT AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE AND RESOLUTION.

WGS THEREFORE ENABLES THE MOST ADVANCED DIAGNOSIS AND PERSONALIZED CARE FOR NEWBORNS, AS WELL AS CHILDREN OF ALL AGES WITH COMPLEX CONDITIONS INCLUDING AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS.   SEVERAL STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, HAVE APPROVED CRITERIA FOR RAPID WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING (RWGS) FOR PEDIATRIC INPATIENTS IN INTENSIVE CARE SETTINGS.  THIS APPROACH HAS SHORTENED DIAGNOSTIC ODYSSEYS FOR CHILDREN, IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND REDUCED COSTS.  MORE THAN 500 CHILDREN PER YEAR MEET THESE CRITERIA AT CHLA, A QUATERNARY CARE REFERRAL INSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEXT STEP TO IMPLEMENT GENOMIC MEDICINE FOR CHILDREN REQUIRES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SEQUENCING CAPACITY AND COMPUTATIONAL POWER.  IN THIS APPLICATION, WE REQUEST FUNDS TO UPGRADE OUR GENOMIC SEQUENCING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INCREASED CAPACITY AND F ASTER SEQUENCING TIMES OF THE ILLUMINA NOVASEQ 6000 TO MEET THIS NEED.  WE ALSO REQUEST COMPLEMENTARY FUNDS TO ACCORDINGLY UPGRADE OUR COMPUTATIONAL CAPACITY TO ACCOMMODATE THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DATA THAT THIS WILL REQUIRE.    TOGETHER, THE IMPROVED DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITY OF WGS AND COMPUTATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WILL ENABLE US TO PROVIDE THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEDIATRIC DIAGNOSTICS.

TO RENOVATE AND MODERNIZE THE THOMAS HEALTH CANCER INFUSION CENTER IN SOUTH CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA. THE FUNDING WILL BE UTILIZED TO REMODEL THE FACILITY TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS RECEIVE CARE AND RECOVER FROM THEIR CANCER TREATMENTS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY ARE CAREFULLY MONITORED BY PROVIDERS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM ON EACH FLOOR OF THE FACILITY.  THE THOMAS HEALTH CANCER INFUSION CENTER WILL BE A FULL SERVICE, REGIONAL FACILITY ABLE TO PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CANCER TREATMENT. ITS HIGHLY QUALIFIED CLINICIANS WILL BE ABLE TO OBSERVE THE EFFECTS OF TREATMENTS PROVIDED FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY TYPE OF CANCER, INCLUDING BREAST, LUNG, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE, HEAD AND NECK, BRAIN, SKIN, GYNECOLOGIC, AND HEMATOLOGICAL DISORDERS. THE UPGRADED INFUSION CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. INFUSION THERAPY IS UTILIZED WHEN MEDICATION OR FLUIDS MUST BE ADMINISTERED TO CANCER PATIENTS THROUGH A NEEDLE OR CATHETER (INTRAVENOUSLY).  IN SOME CASES, IT IS A WAY TO DELIVER MEDICATION TO CANCER PATIENTS WHO CANNOT TAKE CERTAIN ORAL DRUGS. OFTEN IT ALLOWS CANCER TREATMENTS TO BE DISPENSED AT A CONTROLLED PACE. CERTAIN TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY, FOR EXAMPLE, NEED TO BE DRIPPED SLOWLY INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.  THIS PROJECT\u2019S GOALS ARE TO ENABLE MORE CANCER PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE INFUSION THERAPY IN THE CANCER INFUSION CENTER TO RECEIVE TREATMENT AND RECOVER IN AN AREA WHERE NEW ACCOMMODATIONS AND HIGHLY QUALIFIED PROVIDERS WILL ENSURE THAT PATIENTS RECEIVE COMPETENT CARE IN A PROFESSIONAL AND SUPPORTIVE SETTING.   THIS PROJECT AFFECTS A LARG E SWATH OF PATIENTS SERVED BY THOMAS HEALTH. THE HEALTH SYSTEM\u2019S SERVICE AREA INCLUDES NOT JUST PATIENTS FROM KANAWHA COUNTY WHERE THIS NEWLY RENOVATED CANCER INFUSION CENTER WILL BE LOCATED, BUT RESIDENTS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA. THE HEALTH SYSTEM SERVES ROUGHLY 241,000 RESIDENTS FROM AT LEAST SEVEN COUNTIES IN THE REGION.  MANY ARE OLDER, RURAL RESIDENTS WHO TRAVEL FROM REMOTE AREAS TO RECEIVE INFUSION THERAPY.  ACCORDING TO THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY RESIDE, A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF THE RESIDENTS SERVED BY THOMAS HEALTH LIVE IN POVERTY. THE PERCENTAGES OF THOSE WHO DO SO ARE PROVIDED WITH RESPECT TO EACH COUNTY HERE:  KANAWHA (16.3%), PUTNAM (8.9%), LINCOLN (19.7%), BOONE (18.9%), CLAY (22,.5%), ROANE (19.4%) AND JACKSON (16.7%). THOMAS HEALTH HAS HISTORICALLY SERVED PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY AND SEEKS TO PROVIDE CARE TO MEET THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES IT SERVES. THE NEED TO SERVE THESE OFTEN ELDERLY AND LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS IN A NEWLY RENOVATED CANCER INFUSION CENTER IS NO DIFFERENT.  EARLY DETECTION AND ONGOING TREATMENT OF CANCER IS RECOGNIZED BY THOMAS HEALTH AND ALL MEDICAL AUTHORITIES AS BEING AN EXTREMELY HIGH PRIORITY IN WEST VIRGINIA.  ACCORDING TO DATA COLLECTED IN 2020 BY THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION (ARC), WEST VIRGINIA\u2019S CANCER MORTALITY RATE WAS 17% HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE NATION. THESE FIGURES UNDERSCORE HOW CRITICAL IT IS FOR WEST VIRGINIA TO HAVE A BROAD-BASED HEALTH SYSTEM EQUIPPED WITH THE TYPE OF UPGRADED FACILITIES THAT WILL BE SUPPORTED BY THIS FUNDING. IT CAN PROVIDE ONGOING TREATMENT FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND THEREBY DIMINISH YEARS OF POTENTIAL LIVES LOST IN WEST VIRGINIA - A NUMBER THE ARC FOUND WAS 47% HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE NATION ONLY TWO YEARS AGO.

THE PURPOSE OF THE RENOVATION WILL BE TO MAKE ADDITIONAL MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AVAILABLE TO MORE RESIDENTS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA WHO RESIDE IN COUNTIES SERVED BY THOMAS HEALTH. ADDITIONAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE MODERNIZED FACILITY, SINCE THE PROJECT WILL CONVERT EXISTING OFFICE SPACE INTO NEW EXAM ROOMS AND WORK AREAS.  TWO NEW EXAM ROOMS WILL BE ADDED TO THE  CURRENT EIGHT. OTHER AREAS NOW BEING USED FOR CLERICAL OR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A PROVIDER WORK AREA, WHERE LARGER GROUPS OF PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN MEET PRIVATELY WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER MEDICAL PERSONNEL, INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS.   THE RENOVATION WILL MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT FOR A GREATER NUMBER OF PATIENTS TO ACCESS THE FACILITY. IT WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE GREATER INTERACTION BY PATIENTS WITH CAREGIVERS. THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE AND ENABLE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO COMPLETE THEIR HEALTH CARE APPOINTMENTS AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT WITH AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH PROVIDERS TO ADDRESS THEIR HEALTH CONCERNS.   AN EXPANDED FACILITY LIKE THIS IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE CONDITIONS OF THOSE AT RISK OF, OR SUFFERING FROM, SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AS WELL AS OTHER MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. IT IS WELL-RECOGNIZED THAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC EXACERBATED THE SUD EPIDEMIC AND CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES.  IN MANY LOCATIONS, THIS  LED TO GAPS IN SERVICES AND THE NEED FOR SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THAT INCORPORATES ADDITIONAL HEALTHCARE RESOURCES TO BENEFIT COMMUNITIES IN NEED. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.  ACCORDING TO THE WEST VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN RESOURCES, IN RECENT YEARS THE MOUNTAIN STATE HAS RANKED HIGHEST IN THE NATION FOR THE PREVALENCE OF POOR PHYSICAL HEALTH, POOR MENTAL HEALTH, AND ACTIVITY LIMITATIONS DUE TO POOR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH. IN 2018, 21.4% OF WEST VIRGINIA ADULTS HAD NOT HAD A ROUTINE MEDICAL CHECKUP IN THE PAST YEAR, AND 19.5% DID NOT HAVE A PERSONAL DOCTOR OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.  ENABLING A GREATER NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN NEED TO OBTAIN MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THOMAS HEALTH.

THIS LAB WILL ALLOW BOTH CARDIAC AND NEURO INTERVENTION IN THE CASE OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE TO REMOVE CLOTS AND IMPROVE BLOOD FLOW IN THE HEART OR BRAIN. THE NEED FOR THE BIPLANE EQUIPMENT AND EXPANSION OF THE CARDIAC LAB IS URGENT. STROKE IS THE NUMBER FIVE CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE US, KILLING MORE THAN 140,000 PEOPLE PER YEAR. NEARLY 800,000 PEOPLE ANNUALLY IN THE US ARE AFFLICTED WITH A STROKE. PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT BY 2030, STROKE PREVALENCE WILL INCREASE 20% OVER 2012 FIGURES. IN ADDITION STROKE IS A LEADING CAUSE OF LONG TERM DISABILITY, AND STROKE REDUCES MOBILITY IN MORE THAN HALF OF STROKE SURVIVORS AGE 65 AND OVER. AS THE POPULATION OF STATEN ISLAND AGES, THE NEED FOR INTERVENTIONAL STROKE CARE WILL BECOME MORE NEEDED. IN BIPLANE ANGIOGRAPHY, NON-SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR STROKES AND OTHER TIME-CRITICAL CONDITIONS ARE ACCOMPLISHED QUICKLY AND WITH LESS EXPOSURE TO RADIATION BECAUSE IMAGING AND TREATMENT HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME. THE IMAGE RESOLUTION ALSO IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED, ALLOWING FOR TREATMENT OF SMALLER STROKES THAT PREVIOUSLY COULD NOT BE REACHED.

THE CDC ANNOUNCED THAT MORE PEOPLE DIED FROM DRUG OVERDOSE IN 2021 THAN ANY OTHER YEAR IN U.S. HISTORY - MAKING THE PRESENT THE MOST CRITICAL TIME FOR STRENGTHENING THE SYSTEM OF CARE FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD).  THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THAT IS BY INVESTING IN TREATMENT AND LONG-TERM RECOVERY HOUSING AND SUPPORTS.   GATEWAY FOUNDATION\u2019S KEDZIE RECOVERY HOME (KRH) ON THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO IS A VITAL INSTITUTION AND CRITICAL COMMUNITY RESOURCE PROVIDING RECOVERY HOUSING FOR ADULT MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF RESIDENTIAL SUD TREATMENT AND ARE IN NEED OF A STABLE, SAFE, AND SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENT. NEARLY ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE LIVE AT OR BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND COME FROM HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WHERE STRUCTURAL RACISM HAS PREVENTED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FROM HAVING EQUAL ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND WELLNESS SUPPORT.  DESPITE ITS ROLE AS A CRITICAL, SAFETY-NET PROVIDER, KRH HAS SUFFERED FROM YEARS OF DIVESTMENT IN HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE CAPITAL. AREAS NEEDING RENOVATION INCLUDE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE, RETROFITTING AMENITIES TO MEET UNIVERSAL DESIGN STANDARDS, UPDATING RESIDENTIAL LIVING QUARTERS, AND REVITALIZING OUTDOOR AREAS. WITH THIS FUNDING, WE WILL HAVE ONE OF THE FEW FULLY ADA ACCESSIBLE RECOVERY HOMES IN THE AREA WITH THE CAPACITY TO ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE RECEIVING MEDICATION ASSISTED RECOVERY (MAR).  THE KEDZIE RECOVERY HOME RENOVATION PROJECT WILL DRAMATICALLY IMPRO VE AND REVITALIZE AN EXISTING AND ESTABLISHED SOBRIETY-FOCUSED, RECOVERY HOME THAT HAS BEEN OPERATING IN CHICAGO\u2019S WEST SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY. AS A NON-PROFIT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROVIDER, WE FOCUS ALL OF OUR CAPABILITIES ON THE TREATMENT AND SUCCESS OF OUR CLIENTS. WITH EXTERNAL FUNDING, WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE, UPDATE THE FACILITY TO ACCOMMODATE INDIVIDUALS WITH MOBILITY ISSUES, AND CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT FACILITATES LONG-TERM RECOVERY.   THE INTERIOR RENOVATION WILL INCLUDE INSTALLING AN HVAC SYSTEM, AN ELEVATOR, FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM, RENOVATING EXISTING BATHROOMS TO ADA STANDARDS, AS WELL AS REVITALIZING RESIDENTIAL LIVING QUARTERS. ALL OF THE PROJECTS WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT THE SAFETY AND RECOVERY ENVIRONMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING TOWARDS LONG-TERM SOBRIETY. ENABLING PEOPLE TO REACH LONG-TERM SOBRIETY BY CREATING THE MOST OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENT FOR RECOVERY IS NOT ONLY BENEFICIAL TO THOSE DIRECTLY ENGAGED IN TREATMENT, BUT ALSO BENEFICIAL TO OUR SOCIETY AT LARGE BY RETURNING HEALTHY AND MOTIVATED MEMBERS BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES.   THE EXTERIOR PORTION OF THE RENOVATION PROJECT, SUCH AS ADDRESSING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF HARDSCAPE AND LANDSCAPE AREAS, WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE BEAUTIFICATION OF OUR WEST SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD. ALTHOUGH OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BEAUTIFICATION IS VITAL IN ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED AND STRUGGLING NEIGHBORHOODS AS IT BOOSTS REGENERATION AND FOSTERS PRIDE IN THE PLACES WE CALL HOME.

THE NEED FOR THIS EQUIPMENT IS CRITICAL, AS THERE IS NO OTHER ACCESS TO A CARDIAC MRI IN THE SERVICE AREA. DEBORAH IS LOCATED IN A MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA/MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION AS DEFINED BY HRSA. THIS EQUIPMENT WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO STATE-OF-THE-ART HEALTH CARE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS FROM TYPICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.  WHAT TRULY SETS DEBORAH APART FROM ALL OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE UNITED STATES IS OUR OUTSTANDING REPUTATION AS A TOP CARDIOVASCULAR HOSPITAL. FOR A CENTURY, DEBORAH HAS NEVER RENDERED A BILL TO A PATIENT FOR SERVICES RECEIVED WITHIN THE HOSPITAL, NO CO-PAYS, NO DEDUCTIBLES, AND NO BALANCE BILLING. DEBORAH IS THE ONLY HOSPITAL IN THE UNITED STATES THAT TREATS BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS, YET HAS NEVER ISSUED A BILL TO A PATIENT. DEBORAH\u2019S PURPOSE BY ACQUIRING THE ONLY CARDIAC MRI MACHINE IN THE REGION IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SPECIALIZED CARDIOVASCULAR CARE. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE IN OUR REGION AND TO SAVE LIVES.   HEART DISEASE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES; IT AFFECTS EVERY SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. IT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG ALL AMERICANS, MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE. IT IS ALSO THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG WHITES AND BLACKS AND THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG HISPANICS AND ASIANS. ONE PERSON DIES EVERY 36 SECONDS IN THE U.S. FROM  CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. ABOUT 659,000 AMERICANS DIE FROM HEART DISEASE EACH YEAR \u2013 ACCOUNTING FOR ONE IN EVERY FOUR DEATHS.    A CARDIAC MRI USES A POWERFUL MAGNETIC FIELD, RADIOFREQUENCY WAVES, AND A COMPUTER TO CREATE DETAILED CROSS-SECTIONAL 2-DIMENSIONAL AND 3-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES OF THE INSIDE OF THE HEART WITHOUT USING IONIZING RADIATION. THE TEST SHOWS THE HEART\u2019S STRUCTURE (MUSCLE, VALVES, AND CHAMBERS) AND HOW WELL BLOOD FLOWS THROUGH THE HEART AND MAJOR VESSELS. AN MRI OF THE HEART LETS THE CARDIOLOGIST SEE IF THE HEART IS DAMAGED FROM A HEART ATTACK, OR IF THERE IS LACK OF BLOOD FLOW TO THE HEART MUSCLE BECAUSE OF NARROWED OR BLOCKED ARTERIES.  IT IS A PAINLESS AND NONINVASIVE IMAGING TEST THAT CAN SAVE A PATIENT\u2019S LIFE BY HELPING THE CLINICIAN TO DIAGNOSE MANY DIFFERENT HEART CONDITIONS QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY, WITH NO HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS.   SITUATED IN BROWNS MILLS, NEW JERSEY, DEBORAH PRIMARILY SERVES PATIENTS FROM NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, NEW YORK, AND DELAWARE.

THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY WAS APPROXIMATELY 3 DAYS.  TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF OUR PATIENTS ARE OF ETHNIC ORIGIN.  DEBORAH IS ONE MILE FROM THE JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST AND CARES FOR THOUSANDS OF ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY, VETERANS, AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH OUR HEROCARE CONNECT PROGRAM.

THE MAJORITY OF THE SPACE (3,653 SQ FT) WAS FORMALLY USED AS A CARDIOLOGY CLINIC WITH OTHER AREAS (129 SQ FT) FORMALLY USED AS STORAGE AND A CONFERENCE ROOM. RENOVATING THIS AREA WILL ENABLE THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM TO HAVE ADEQUATE SPACE FOR LEARNING WHILE REMAINING CLOSE TO THE HOSPITAL.   THE FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY SPACE WILL INCLUDE OFFICES FOR SUPPORT STAFF (PROGRAM DIRECTOR, PROGRAM COORDINATOR, ETC.)

NEED EARLY IN 2019 OSF ST. JOSEPH LEADERSHIP BEGAN DISCUSSIONS WITH SYSTEM LEADERSHIP AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS COLLEGE OF MEDICINE PEORIA REGARDING DEVELOPING A FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN THE OSF EASTERN REGION (BLOOMINGTON-PONTIAC-URBANA-DANVILLE). BLOOMINGTON-NORMAL WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE CHOSEN LOCATION BECAUSE OF PRIMARY CARE NEED, MARKET DYNAMICS (GROWING), UN-OPPOSED ENVIRONMENT (MEANING RESIDENTS DO NOT HAVE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER GME RESIDENTS FOR CASES) AND AVAILABILITY OF FACULTY.   OSF MEDICAL GROUP HAS A LARGE WELL-DEVELOPED PRIMARY CARE NETWORK IN AND AROUND THE BLOOMINGTON NORMAL MARKET; HOWEVER MANY OF THE PHYSICIANS ARE AT THE AGE OF RETIREMENT OR WILL BE AT THAT AGE WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS. IN TODAY\u2019S WORLD, IT IS VERY HARD TO RECRUIT PHYSICIANS TO DOWNSTATE ILLINOIS UNLESS THEY ARE FROM THE AREA OR TRAINED IN THE AREA. A FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM WILL HELP OSF GROW FAMILY PRACTICE PHYSICIANS AND INSURE LONG TERM ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY. RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED A LINK BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND APP\u2019S IN AN AREA AND THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE POPULATION.   THE 2020 POPULATION OF THE BLOOMINGTON-NORMAL AREA WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 201,268. IN CONTRAST TO THE REST OF ILLINOIS, THE AREA EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN POPULATION FROM 2010, WHEN THE POPULATION WAS 186,444. THE POPULATION AGES 65 YEARS AND OVER INCREASED FROM 20,720 (2010) TO 31,689 (2020), A CHANGE OF 10,969 (52.9%).

THE TRC MEETS PATIENTS WHERE THEY ARE AT, AND OFFERS SERVICES THAT MEET EACH INDIVIDUAL\u2019S, EMOTIONAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SPIRITUAL NEEDS.

ALL CARE ADHERES TO CULTURALLY HUMBLE AND TRAUMA-INFORMED GUIDELINES, AS WELL AS FOLLOWS BEST PRACTICES BY DATA-DRIVEN RESEARCH, INCLUDING UTILIZATION OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS WITH EVIDENCE-BASED EFFICACY FOR TREATMENT OF TRAUMA-AND-STRESSOR RELATED DISORDERS. THE TRC PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY, BOTH UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED. THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER WAS DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ILLINOIS CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION AUTHORITY AND FUNDED IN PART BY THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT.    PROJECT FUNDING RATIONALE  MANY COMMUNITIES IN TRC SERVICE AREAS HAVE LITTLE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES, DUE IN PART TO GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND INEQUITABLE HEALTH RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION. INDIVIDUALS IN THESE AREAS MUST OFTEN TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO RECEIVE SPECIALIZED TRAUMA CARE. RESIDENTS OFTEN HAVE LIMITED MEANS WITH HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATION, HIGHER INCIDENCE OF CHRONIC ILLNESS AND DISABILITY, AND MORE RECENTLY, ARE MOST IMPACTED BY COVID-19.  FOR MANY CLIENTS, AS WELL AS THOSE WITH DISABILITIES, RIDESHARE AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ARE NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE OPTIONS, AS THEY ARE COST PROHIBITIVE  AND NOT DISABILITY FRIENDLY. TRANSPORTATION ACCESS AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ARE CRITICAL SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT THE TRC HOPES TO ADDRESS THROUGH THIS REQUEST. THE LOWERED-FLOOR MINI VANS WILL PROVIDE A SAFE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM CARE, AS WELL AS BE USED FOR WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SUCH AS TRANSPORTING CLOTHING AND FOOD IF NEEDED. CHROMEBOOKS WILL PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH VITAL ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH SERVICES AND EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, OVER 50 PERCENT OF TRC\u2019S SESSIONS NOW OCCUR VIRTUALLY, WHICH HAS UNEXPECTEDLY BOTH INCREASED CLIENT PARTICIPATION AND REDUCED CANCELATIONS. MOVING FORWARD, THE TRC WILL EMPLOY A HYBRID IN-PERSON/VIRTUAL MODEL, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE TRC TO CONTINUE PRESENT THE OPTION OF TELEHEALTH FOR THOSE IN GREATEST NEED.   CONCLUSION  ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER OPENED IN 1961 FOLLOWING A FUNDRAISING EFFORT LED BY SOUTHLAND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THANKS TO THE COMMITMENT OF ALL WHO BELIEVE IN ITS MISSION, ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER HAS EVOLVED INTO ONE OF THE TOP HOSPITALS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE TRC THERE SERVES A CRITICAL PURPOSE IN THE COMMUNITY, AND IN THIS ERA OF DECLINING REIMBURSEMENTS AND INCREASING HEALTH NEEDS, WE BELIEVE THAT SHOULD THIS COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING REQUEST BE APPROVED, IT WOULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ENSURING ACCESS TO THE VERY BEST CARE FOR SURVIVORS OF TRAUMA.

THE NEW FACILITY WILL REPLACE THE EXISTING OUTGROWN SCHOOL OF NURSING CURRENTLY HOUSED IN THE BASEMENT OF A LOCAL HOSPITAL, MORE THAN DOUBLING THE CAPACITY OF THE MVC SCHOOL OF NURSING PROGRAM THE PROJECTED COST OF THE NEW FACILITY IS $5,291,750. MISSOURI VALLEY COLLEGE IS REQUESTING A CONSTRUCTION GRANT FROM HRSA OF $2,000,000. THE REMAINING $3,291,750 IS BEING FUNDED BY MVC FROM DONATIONS OF ALUMNI, FRIENDS OF THE COLLEGE, NON-PROFIT FOUNDATIONS, AND THE CITY OF MARSHALL.

IN MISSOURI, THE NURSING OCCUPATIONS OF A REGISTERED NURSE, CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT, LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSE, AND NURSE PRACTITIONER HOLD EMPLOYEE VACANCY RATES OF OVER 7%, MARKING A HIGHLY INCREASED DEMAND FOR NURSING PROFESSIONALS. NURSING SHORTAGES ARE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED WITHIN RURAL COUNTIES. COMPOUNDING THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE, MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF MISSOURI\u2019S RNS ARE AGE 55 OR OLDER, INCREASING TO NEARLY HALF IN SOME RURAL COUNTIES, WITH RETIREMENT IMMINENT.

NEWTON IS THE ONLY ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL LOCATED IN SUSSEX COUNTY, NJ.  LIKE MOST HOSPITALS AROUND THE COUNTRY, NEWTON MEDICAL CENTER HAS SEEN AN INCREASING NEED IN THE COMMUNITY FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES.  WHILE THE STRESSES OF THE PANDEMIC HAVE CERTAINLY PLAYED A ROLE, THE OVERALL RISE IN THE NEED FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE PREDATES THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW WHEN A DEGREE OF NORMALCY RESUMES IN THE DAILY LIVES OF OUR PATIENTS.    IN PARTICULAR, THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) HAS SEEN A GROWING NUMBER OF CASES PRESENTING FOR TREATMENT, AND THESE CASES REQUIRE SPECIALIZED TREATMENT AREAS THAT ARE REMOVED FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION OF ED PATIENTS. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS BEING SEEN IN THE ED ARE INCREASINGLY ACUTE AND INCLUDE AN INCREASE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE CASES FROM THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND FROM ALCOHOL USE.  THE PATIENTS PRESENTING FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE ALSO INCLUDE ADOLESCENTS, CHILDREN, AND GERIATRIC PATIENTS.   DUE TO THE PAUCITY OF INPATIENT BEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE, PATIENTS NEEDING HOSPITALIZATION TEND TO STAY IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR LONGER PERIODS.  THE WAITING PERIOD REQUIRES THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO DRAW MORE RESOURCES TO TREAT AND SAFELY MAINTAIN THE PATIENTS IN AN ENVIRONMENT NOT INTENDED FOR LONG TERM STAYS.  THE CURRENT CAPACITY IN THE NMC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IS TWO SMALL SECURE HOLDING AREAS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS AS THEY UNDERGO EVALUATION AND AWAIT A TRANSFER TO AN INPATIENT BED IF NEEDED.

FOUR TO FIVE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT STAFF JOBS WILL BE CREATED TO SUPPORT THE CLINIC OPERATIONS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ONE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IN RURAL COMMUNITIES CARRIES A PATIENT LOAD OF 2,500. THIS CLINIC WILL ADD THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE A MEDICAL HOME TO 10,000 RESIDENTS.    TODAY'S RURAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY FRAGILE, AND OPERATING MARGINS ARE THIN, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS REGION IS HOME TO HIGH UTILIZERS OF HEALTHCARE, PRIMARILY MEDICARE OR MEDI-CAL (MEDICAID) PAYORS, WHERE REIMBURSEMENT DOES NOT COVER THE COST OF CARE.

WE ARE CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD) RECOVERY CAMPUS THAT WILL BRING ALL OF OUR SERVICES INTO ONE LOCATION.   THE PROJECT INVOLVES RENOVATING A 45,000 SQUARE FOOT THREE-STORY BUILDING LOCATED IN SWISSVALE, PA, NEXT TO POWER\u2019S HALFWAY HOUSE, AND WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THE BUILDING WAS BUILT IN 1957 AND CONSISTS OF 48,390 SQUARE FEET OVER THREE-LEVELS. RENOVATION BEGINS AUGUST 2022.  THE FIRST PHASE OF WORK INCLUDES: INTERIOR DEMOLITION AND RENOVATION OF THE WEST WING; CONSTRUCTION OF AN ACCESSIBLE ENTRYWAY; REPLACEMENT OF ALL MAJOR MECHANICAL SYSTEMS; NEW FLOORING, LIGHTING, AND ACOUSTICAL CEILINGS; AN EXCAVATED COURTYARD, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND REPLACEMENT OF A PAVED SURFACE WITH GRASS.  PHASE 1 WILL COMPLETE BY MAY 2023 AND THE POWER CAMPUS WILL OPEN JULY 2023. THE SECOND PHASE WILL BE COMPLETED AFTER THE CAMPUS IS OPEN WITH NO DISRUPTION TO SERVICES.  THE CAMPUS WILL HOUSE ALL OF POWER\u2019S PROGRAMS, EXCEPT OUR 26-BED LICENSED, RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITYWHICH IS LOCATED ACROSS THE LAWN.

THE FIRST FLOOR WILL BE OCCUPIED BY COMMUNITY PARTNERS PROVIDING WRAPAROUND SERVICES LIKE HEALTH CARE, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND OTHER SERVICES, FOR OUR CLIENTS, AND FOR THE SWISSVALE COMMUNITY. BY BRINGING THESE SERVICES TOGETHER IN ONE LOCATION, WE WILL ELIMINATE BARRIER S THAT INTERFERE WITH ACCESS TO CARE. WOMEN WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO JUGGLE PROVIDERS SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN ENGAGED IN THEIR RECOVERY PROCESS, ENHANCING THEIR CHANCES FOR LONG-TERM HEALTH.  CREATING THE CAMPUS MEANS JOBS FOR THOSE PLANNING, DESIGNING, AND BUILDING THE CAMPUS. WHEN COMPLETE, THE POWER CAMPUS WILL PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND SERVICES, CREATING MORE JOBS. THERE WILL BE EVENT SPACE AVAILABLE FOR COMMUNITY USE. AND, QUALITY SERVICES WILL BE OFFERED TO ALL, IN WAYS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE.  IN PENNSYLVANIA, 10 PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF SUD. THE CDC ESTIMATES THAT FOR EVERY ONE WOMAN THAT DIES FROM OVERDOSE, MORE THAN 30 VISIT AN EMERGENCY ROOM AS A RESULT OF THE DISEASE. WHEN MOTHERS ARE ADDICTED, BABIES ARE BORN WITH NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME, FAMILIES ARE SEPARATED, AND CHILDREN SUFFER. IN 2019, 2,900 CHILDREN IN PENNSYLVANIA WERE REMOVED FROM THE HOME BECAUSE OF PARENTAL DRUG USE.  RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WOMEN OFTEN USE DRUGS DIFFERENTLY, RESPOND TO DRUGS DIFFERENTLY, AND CAN HAVE UNIQUE OBSTACLES TO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AS SIMPLE AS NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND CHILD CARE OR BEING PRESCRIBED TREATMENT THAT HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY TESTED ON WOMEN. ACCORDING TO NIH, OVER 80% OF WOMEN WITH SUD ARE ALSO VICTIMS OF TRAUMA, MOST OFTEN CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE OR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. WE BELIEVE ALL WOMEN SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE OF A WOMAN-ONLY ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT WHERE THEY CAN FEEL SAFE AND THE TREATMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THEM.   CREATING A CAMPUS FOR WOMEN WORKING TO RECLAIM THEIR LIVES FROM ADDICTION WILL BE GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY. WHEN WOMEN ARE HEALTHY, THEY CAN LEAD LIVES THAT ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE.

A PRIVATE INFUSION ROOM WILL ALLOW FOR THOSE PATIENTS IN CONTACT PRECAUTIONS TO BE PROPERLY SEGREGATED FROM THE REMAINING VULNERABLE PATIENT POPULATION. AN EXAM ROOM THAT DOUBLES AS A CONSULTATION ROOM WILL ALLOW FOR PROPER SPACE FOR PROVIDERS TO HAVE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR PATIENTS WITH THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS PRESENT. A ROOM THAT HOUSES A BED STYLE SET UP WILL ALLOW FOR MORE COMFORTABLE INFUSIONS FOR PATIENTS AND ALSO PROVIDE AN AREA TO PERFORM BEDSIDE PROCEDURES. ADDITIONAL EXAM ROOMS WILL ALLOW SCHEDULERS TO MAXIMIZE AVAILABILITY IN PROVIDERS\u2019 SCHEDULES, BRINGING IN MORE PATIENTS WITHOUT INCREASING WAIT TIMES DUE TO LIMITED EXAM ROOMS.  THE NEW SPACE WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE ROOM NEEDED FOR PEOPLE WORKING IN THE CLINIC. PROVIDERS WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL SPACE THAT WILL GIVE THEM PRIVACY FOR PHONE CALLS AND MEETINGS.

THIS PROJECT ENCOMPASSES THE RENOVATION OF THE FORMER MEDICAL SURGICAL UNIT ON THE CHEBOYGAN CAMPUS SECOND FLOOR TO ACCOMMODATE AN 18-BED ADULT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT.   NORTHERN MICHIGAN IS SEVERELY UNDERSERVED IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE NORTHWEST COMMUNITY HEALTH INNOVATION REGION MENTAL HEALTH BLUEPRINT FOR ACTION FOUND THAT 25,500 INDIVIDUALS ACROSS NORTHWEST MICHIGAN HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGE AND 35% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE UNTREATED. OF MICHIGAN\u2019S 2,287 ADULT INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BEDS, ONLY 32 ARE LOCATED IN THE MCLAREN NORTHERN MICHIGAN (MNM) SERVICE AREA.   ADDITIONALLY, OUR AREA FACES A SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE IN PSYCHIATRISTS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, WHILE APPROXIMATELY 17% OF THE U.S. POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES, ONLY 10% OF PHYSICIANS PRACTICE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND 55% OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS ARE LOCATED IN NON-METROPOLITAN AREAS. A 2019 ALTARUM CONSULTING REPORT FOUND THAT THE ACCESS GAP FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING ANY MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS (AMI) IS APPROXIMATELY 14,500 INDIVIDUALS IN THE MCLAREN NORTHERN MICHIGAN PRIMARY SERVICE AREA.   IN FISCAL YEAR 2021, MCLAREN NORTHERN MICHIGAN SERVED 1,093 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS WITHIN THE TWO EMERGENCY ROOMS (CHEBOYGAN A ND PETOSKEY CAMPUSES). OF THOSE PATIENTS, 89% ARE ADULTS AND 11% ARE CHILDREN (21 AND UNDER); 47% ARE LOW INCOME BASED ON MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY; AND AT LEAST 24% ARE 65 OR OLDER BASED ON MEDICARE ENROLLMENT.   ON AVERAGE, 2.5 PATIENTS WITH EMERGENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE HELD IN A MNM EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) DAILY. PATIENTS OFTEN REQUIRE MULTIPLE OVERNIGHT STAYS WHILE ED STAFF TRY TO FIND PROPER PLACEMENT. PATIENT PLACEMENT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE AND PATIENTS HAVE BEEN SENT AS FAR NORTH AS MARQUETTE, AS FAR SOUTH AS DETROIT AND OCCASIONALLY, OUT OF STATE. THIS ADDS AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN TO THE PATIENT AND THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEM.

THE PANDEMIC INCREASED FOOD INSECURITY AMONG FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHO ALREADY FACED HUNGER AT HIGHER RATES BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE ESPECIALLY HARD HIT BY HUNGER DUE TO THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES OF LIVING IN ISOLATED COMMUNITIES.  THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION, LIMITED FOOD ACCESS AND OPTIONS, LIMITED HIGH-WAGE JOB OPPORTUNITIES, AND HIGHER RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT. POVERTY RATES IN MOST COUNTIES CAPECO SERVES IS ABOVE THE STATE RATE OF 13%.  GILLIAM, MORROW, UMATILLA, AND WHEELER COUNTIES HAVE A 10.7%, 15.5%, 18.1%, AND 20.0% POVERTY RATE RESPECTIVELY.   FOOD INSECURITY RATES WITHIN CAPECO\u2019S SERVICE AREA RANGE FROM 10 TO 14 PERCENT, AVERAGING 12.6%.   FOOD INSECURITY IS HIGHER IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN, WITH 54% TO 69% OF STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR FREE AND REDUCED SCHOOL MEALS.2    AT CAPECO, WE SERVE AS A REGIONAL FOOD BANK OF OREGON FOOD BANK SERVING UMATILLA, MORROW, GILLIAM, AND WHEELER COUNTIES. SINCE 1987 WE HAVE BEEN DEDICATED TO SERVING PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM FOOD INSECURITY BY SUPPORTING SEVENTEEN MEMBER AGENCIES AND PROVIDING SERVICES DIRECTLY TARGETED TO AGING PERSONS AND THE LOCAL TRIBAL COMMUNITY. IT IS WITH THIS IN MIND THAT OUR ATTENTION TURNS TO THE IMPACTS OF RURAL HUNGER AND HIGHEST IMPACTED PERSONS INCLUDING CHILDREN, OLDER ADULTS, AND BLACK, INDIGENOUS, AND PERSONS OF COLOR (BIPOC).  THE NEED FOR A MULTI-SERVICE, MULTI-GENERATIONAL FACILITY TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY IS PARAMOUNT. THE PURPOSE OF THE EASTERN OREGON FOOD CENTER IS TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE NEE DS UNDER ONE ROOF. THE FOUNDATION OF OUR WORK IS THE COLLECTION, STORAGE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF UNITED STATE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) COMMODITIES PAIRED WITH FOODS COLLECTED LOCALLY FROM BUSINESSES AND GROWERS AND FROM OREGON FOOD BANK.   THE CENTER WILL SERVE AS A REGIONAL FOOD BANK WITH ABILITY TO EXPAND LOCAL FOOD COLLECTIONS IN A TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED SPACE WITH THE NECESSARY CLEANING AND DISPOSAL ELEMENTS. ADEQUATE DRY STORAGE, FREEZER, AND COOLER SPACE WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO INCREASING OUR CAPACITY. A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN WILL SERVE AS THE FOCAL POINT IN CREATING MEAL SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING CONGREGATE AND HOME-DELIVERED MEALS FOR OLDER ADULTS. THIS GROUP MEAL SPACE WILL SERVE AS A COMMUNITY-BASED STRENGTHENING SPACE TO ENGAGE OLDER ADULTS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF NUTRITION EDUCATION AND ACTIVITIES.  IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY, CAPECO RECOGNIZES THE POTENTIAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIPS THROUGH SHARED COMMUNITY SPACE. EASTERN OREGON IS AGRICULTURALLY RICH AND CAPECO WILL OPEN THE COMMERCIAL KITCHEN TO PEOPLE AND SMALL BUSINESSES TO TEST PRODUCTS FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION. FOCUS WILL BE GIVEN TO MINORITY-BASED BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE TO HELP CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES.   THE FACILITY WILL ALSO ALLOW CAPECO TO FOCUS ON COMMUNITY-STRENGTHENING WHILE IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY AND INCREASING ACCESS TO FRESH AND LOCAL FOODS.

THE CONTINUUM OF CRISIS SERVICES IN CLERMONT COUNTY IS QUITE ROBUST FOR RURAL OHIO INCLUDING A 24/7 HOTLINE, 24/7 MCT, AND MRSS. THESE SERVICES ARE READILY EXPANDING INTO BROWN COUNTY. A GAP IN THE CONTINUUM EXISTS IN THE AREAS OF CRISIS STABILIZATION AND INPATIENT SERVICES WHICH REQUIRE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN CRISIS TO TRAVEL IN EXCESS OF ONE HOUR TO ACCESS SUCH CARE. THE GEOGRAPHIC BARRIER PREVENTS FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN CARE AND REDUCES SUCCESSFUL RE-INTEGRATION INTO THE COMMUNITY UPON DISCHARGE.

WHILE BOTH PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL, BECAUSE THEY ARE LOCATED ONLY FOUR MILES APART THERE ARE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD BE ATTAINED BY COMBINING LOCATIONS. AT THE HERRIN HOSPITAL LOCATION PARKING AND NAVIGATION BETWEEN THE PARKING LOT AND THE REHAB ENTRANCE IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. DUE TO THE LAYOUT, THERE ARE NO PARKING SPACES LOCATED DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE HOSPITAL ENTRANCE, REQUIRING PATIENTS TO BOTH NAVIGATE THROUGH THE CONGESTION OF HOSPITAL TRAFFIC AS WELL AS TRAVEL LONGER DISTANCES FROM THEIR CAR TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE HOSPITAL. THIS PRESENTS SAFETY CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY FOR ELDERLY PATIENTS AND THOSE RECEIVING THERAPY SERVICES FOR FOOT, ANKLE, LEG, OR BALANCE ISSUES. BECAUSE THE TYPICAL PATIENT RECEIVING OUTPATI ENT THERAPY DOES NOT UTILIZE OTHER HOSPITAL-BASED SERVICES AT THE TIME OF THEIR APPOINTMENT, THIS CREATES DIFFICULTIES AND FRUSTRATIONS FOR MOST PATIENTS.

PRATT CANCER CENTER LOCATED ON MERCY\u2019S MAIN CAMPUS IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI. THIS PROJECT WILL BRING PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE SERVICES AND NEW CANCER TREATMENT MODALITIES TO OUR COMMUNITY, MAKING EASILY ACCESSIBLE PROTON THERAPY A REALITY FOR ST. LOUIS AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS.  PROTON THERAPY IS THE MOST ADVANCED FORM OF RADIOTHERAPY CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND IS NO LONGER LIMITED TO ACADEMIC CENTERS WITH A RESEARCH FOCUS. COMMUNITY CANCER CENTERS THAT PROVIDE CLINICAL CARE ARE ADDING PROTON THERAPY TO THE MIX OF SERVICES OFFERED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THE PRIMARY ADVANTAGE OF THIS TREATMENT METHOD IS ITS PINPOINT ACCURACY. THE PROTONS CAN BE FOCUSED DIRECTLY ON THE CANCER TUMOR, WITH UNNECESSARY RADIATION AND VERY MINIMAL SIDE-EFFECTS ON SURROUNDING HEALTHY TISSUE. TRADITIONAL RADIATION THERAPY CANNOT TARGET SUCH TUMORS BECAUSE IT CAN DAMAGE THE SURROUNDING NERVES. PROTON THERAPY IS PAINLESS AND NON-INVASIVE. IT IS VERY PRECISE, AND THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL RADIATION. PROTON BEAM THERAPY HAS BEEN AVAILABLE SINCE 1990 IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ITS USE HAS NOT SPREAD WIDELY DUE TO HIGH COSTS.  THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF PROTON THERAPY SERVICES IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI. IN FACT, THERE ARE ONLY TWO PROTON CENTERS IN MISSOURI. THE NEAREST CENTERS OUTSIDE THE ST. LOUIS AREA ARE IN CHICAGO AND TENNESSEE, AND SOON KANSAS CITY. THE LIMITED ACCESS IN OUR SERVICE REGION RESULTS IN PROTON THERAPY NOT BEING AVAILABLE TO MANY CANCER PATIENTS. SOME PATIENTS ARE FORCED TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO RECEIVE CARE. THIS ADDS ADDITIONAL STRESS FOR FAMILIES, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED AND STRUGGLE WITH TRANSPORTATION AND  GAS COSTS. ACCESS CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY A PATIENT'S HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. IN SOME INSTANCES, PATIENTS REFERRED BY MERCY PHYSICIANS CANNOT BE TREATED AT THE OTHER PROTON THERAPY CENTERS DUE TO MANAGED CARE AGREEMENTS OR OTHER INSURANCE ISSUES THAT PREVENT THEM FROM RECEIVING CARE. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE SPECIFIC TO MERCY IS OUR REACH THAT GOES DEEP INTO RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. PATIENTS CAN BE EVALUATED FOR TREATMENT AT THEIR NEAREST MERCY ONCOLOGY FACILITY, ELIMINATING UNNECESSARY TRAVEL. MERCY OFFERS CHARITY CARE, WHICH IS A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR LOW-INCOME AND UNINSURED PATIENTS.   THE PROTON THERAPY CENTER IS PART OF A LARGER CAMPAIGN AT MERCY HOSPITAL ST. LOUIS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY CANCER CARE. AS PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO THE REGION, MERCY OPENED THE DAVID C. PRATT CANCER CENTER, CREATED A PERSONALIZED MODEL OF CARE, AND BECAME A TOP ROBOTIC SURGERY PROGRAM. WE'VE SEEN CONSISTENT GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS SEEKING CANCER CARE AT MERCY. SINCE OPENING THE DAVID C. PRATT CANCER, WE ARE SERVING TWICE AS MANY CANCER PATIENTS. FROM 2007 TO 2019, 36,759 PATIENTS HAVE CHOSEN THE DAVID C. PRATT CANCER CENTER FOR THEIR CANCER CARE.  THE ESTIMATED 2020 POPULATION OF THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IS 2,506,549 AND SPANS A FOURTEEN-COUNTY AREA IN AND AROUND ST. LOUIS. MERCY HAS AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF CLINICS AND HOSPITALS ALONG THE I-44 CORRIDOR AND IN SOUTHWEST MISSOURI. ALTHOUGH THIS APPLICATION SPEAKS TO THE NEED FOR MERCY PATIENTS IN THE ST.

BRAINS BANKS OFFER AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLORE THE HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TBIS AND IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE MECHANISMS; NONETHELESS, THEY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND HAVE LOW SUPPLY IN THE US, PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHERN REGION. TULANE UNIVERSITY IS WELL-POSITIONED TO GENERATE MULTIDIMENSIONAL EVIDENCE TO ADVANCE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING TBIS. OUR INSTITUTION CURRENTLY HOUSES MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE DIRECT MEDICAL CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WITHIN POPULATIONS AT RISK, INCLUDING ATHLETES (AT ALL LEVELS OF PLAY), FORMER ATHLETES, VETERANS OF THE ARMED FORCES, FIRST RESPONDERS, AND ELDERLY ADULTS. IN ADDITION, WE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED THE TULANE UNIVERSITY BRAIN BANK, WHICH IS ACTIVELY RECEIVING ORGAN DONATIONS. THE FUNDING REQUESTED VIA THIS APPLICATION WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO FURNISHING THE TULANE UNIVERSITY BRAIN BANK HISTOPATHOLOGY LABORATORY WITH THE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT TO CONDUCT ADVANCED HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ANALYSES AND CREATE A TISSUE REPOSITORY.

EVEN VERY BASIC CARE WAS MARGINALIZED, AVAILABLE PART-TIME, AND SEVERELY LIMITED IN SCOPE; DENTAL, PHARMACEUTICAL AND CHRONIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICES HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SPARSE TO NON-EXISTENT. THE RURAL REGION IS ETHNICALLY DIVERSE INCLUDING 54% OF THE POPULATION HISPANIC, 39% CAUCASIAN, AND 7% OTHER ETHNICITIES, INCLUDING NATIVE AMERICANS AND 2-ETHNICITY (MIXED ETHNIC) FAMILIES. THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS OVER 940 STUDENTS AND REPORTS THAT 87% OF THESE STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH. PROFICIENCY LEVELS ARE 20% FOR MATH AND 27% FOR READING.

JENNINGS HAS A SIGNIFICANT REGIONAL ECONOMIC IMPACT, EMPLOYING OVER 350 INDIVIDUALS AND PROVIDING A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR SENIORS\u2014FROM INDEPENDENT LIVING RESIDENCES TO LONG-TERM CARE.  THE JENNINGS-PROTECTING SENIORS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS PROJECT WILL PURCHASE AND PLACE CRITICAL SAFE MOVEMENT EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING CEILING LIFT SYSTEMS, SIT-TO-STAND LIFTS AND FLOOR LIFTS, AT FIVE JENNINGS LOCATIONS IN NORTHEAST OHIO TO REDUCE LIFTING-RELATED INJURIES AMONG HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND NURSING HOME AND ASSISTED LIVING RESIDENTS. THIS EQUIPMENT DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN HEALTHCARE WORKER INJURIES AND OVER $100,000 IN WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION COST-SAVINGS DURING AN ON-SITE KENT STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH STUDY CONDUCTED IN 2009.  HEALTHCARE IS THE FASTEST-GROWING SECTOR OF THE U.S. ECONOMY, EMPLOYING OVER 18 MILLION WORKERS. WOMEN REPRESENT NEARLY 80% OF THE HEALTHCARE WORK FORCE. HEALTHCARE WORKERS FACE A WIDE RANGE OF HAZARDS ON THE JOB, INCLUDING BACK INJURIES AND STRESS, AMONG OTHERS. THE U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS REPORTS THAT BACK INJURIES ACCOUNT FOR 42% OF ALL HEALTH CARE WORKER INJURIES COMPARED TO 27% IN ALL OTHER OCCUPATIONS INCLUDING TRUCK DRIVERS, LABORERS, AND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS.   PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES AMONG NURSING STAFF OFTEN CAUSES DEDICATED HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO LEAVE THEIR CAREERS PREMATURELY AND DISCOURAGES QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS FROM ENT ERING THE FIELD. MISSED WORKDAYS AND VOLUNTARY TURNOVER DUE TO LIFTING AND TRANSFERRING INJURIES IS OF CRITICAL CONCERN GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CURRENT AND FUTURE DEMAND FOR THESE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT A GROWING AGING POPULATION. IT ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS. ACCORDING TO BETTER JOBS, BETTER CARE, THE AVERAGE NATIONAL COST OF TURNOVER FOR DIRECT CARE WORKERS IS $4.1 BILLION ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY, ACCORDING TO TEAM NEO, HEALTHCARE-RELATED SECTORS IN NORTHEAST OHIO ARE AMONG THE TOP 10 EMPLOYMENT SECTORS TO GROW BY 2023 WITH MORE THAN 8,500 NET NEW JOB OPENINGS. THE PERSONAL CARE SECTOR RANKS THE SECOND HIGHEST, MAINLY DUE TO AN AGING POPULATION.   THE SAFE MOVEMENT EQUIPMENT INCLUDED IN JENNINGS-PROTECTING SENIORS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS PROJECT WILL ALSO PREVENT LIFTING AND TRANSFER-RELATED INJURIES AMONG NURSING HOME AND ASSISTED LIVING RESIDENTS. DUE TO THE FRAGILE CONDITION OF RESIDENTS AND PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO MOVE OR AMBULATE ON THEIR OWN, ACCIDENTAL INJURIES WHILE BEING MANUALLY LIFTED OR TRANSFERRED IS OF CRITICAL CONCERN, BOTH FOR RESIDENTS AND FOR THE CAREGIVER STAFF. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN NURSES ASSOCIATION, ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO PATIENT HANDLING AND MOVEMENT INCLUDE PAIN WHEN LIFTING PATIENTS UNDER THEIR ARMS AND INJURY FROM FALLS, CONTUSIONS, BRUISING AND SKIN TEARS.   THE GAP IN THE PROJECTED SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR LONG-TERM CARE WORKERS RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THERE WILL BE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO CARE FOR OLDER ADULTS INTO THE FUTURE.

JOSEPH HOSPITAL\u2019S (SJH) IS AN ACUTE CARE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL THAT SERVES THE THIRD MOST POPULATED CITY IN MAINE AND GREATER PENOBSCOT COUNTY WHERE 19.1% OF THE POPULATION IS AGED 65 AND OLDER. SJH SERVES MANY OF THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF THE GREATER BANGOR AREA COMMUNITY, INCLUDING OLDER ADULTS, LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES, COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE NEEDS REQUIRING INPATIENT STAYS. IN 2020, THE AVERAGE AGE OF ADMITTED PATIENTS AT SJH WAS 67 YEARS OLD. WITH ALMOST 20% OF THE TAX BASE IN PENOBSCOT COUNTY OVER AGE 65, SJH\u2019S INVESTMENT IN BUILDING AN AGE-FRIENDLY HEALTH SYSTEM WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT OLDER ADULTS AND THEIR FAMILIES NOW AND IN THE FUTURE.   OLDER ADULTS ARE DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECTED BY CHRONIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DIABETES, ARTHRITIS, AND HEART DISEASE. EIGHTY PERCENT HAVE AT LEAST ONE CHRONIC CONDITION, AND NEARLY 70 PERCENT OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES HAVE TWO OR MORE. OLDER ADULTS ARE HOSPITALIZED FOR FALL-RELATED INJURIES FIVE TIMES MORE OFTEN THAN FOR INJURIES FROM OTHER CAUSES, AND FALLS COST OUR NATION $50 BILLION EACH YEAR. NEARLY 6 MILLION OLDER ADULTS ARE LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE; DEMENTIA, DELIRIUM, AND CONFUSION ARE COMMON ON OUR HOSPITAL FLOORS, AND MAKES THESE PATIENTS PRONE TO INJURIES.  ST. JOSEPH HOSPITAL\u2019S LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A STATE-OF-THE-ART AGE-FRIENDLY HEALTH SYSTEM TO BETTER SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. SUCH A SYSTEM INVOLVES EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF ITS WORKFORCE ATTENDING TO WHAT MATTERS TO THE OLDER ADULT, CAUSING NO HARM, AND AND FOLLOWING EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES. IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT, SJH PLANS TO INCREASE THE SIZE AND FUNCTION OF 21 SURGICAL/ORTHOPEDIC INPATIENT ROOMS AT SJH AS PART OF A LONG-TERM PLAN TO RENOVATE ALL 78 INPATIENT ROOMS OF THE 74-YEAR-OLD HOSPITAL. THE CDS FUNDS WILL INITIATE THESE RENOVATIONS ON THE 4TH AND 6TH FLOORS BY PROVIDING START-UP MONIES TO CREATE A SOUND, AGE-FRIENDLY RE NOVATION PLAN. THESE FUNDS WILL ALLOW US TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT THE AGE-FRIENDLY RENOVATIONS STARTING WITH ACOUSTICAL CEILINGS TO REDUCE EXTRANEOUS NOISES, NON-SLIP AND NON-GLARE FLOORING, IMPROVED LIGHTING AND INCREASING THE HEIGHT OF TOILETS TO APPROPRIATE LEVELS TO REDUCE FALLS. SJH WILL PURCHASE AND INSTALL PATIENT LIFTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF OUR PATIENT POPULATION AND DECREASE HEALTHCARE WORKERS\u2019 BURDEN.  THESE CDS FUNDS WILL SUPPORT THE CARE NEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY 1,000 INPATIENTS EACH YEAR THAT UTILIZE THE SERVICES OF OUR INPATIENT ROOMS AT SJH. RENOVATIONS AND UPGRADES WILL INCREASE PATIENT SAFETY, PROVIDE A COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR CARE, IMPROVE PATIENT SATISFACTION, AND REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS (E.G., LOWER RATE OF FALLS AND DIMINISHED LENGTH OF STAY).   LONGER-TERM PLANNING (NOT INCLUDED IN THIS CDS ALLOCATION) INCLUDES INCREASING THE SIZE AND FUNCTION OF THE INPATIENT ROOMS (SURGICAL CARE / ORTHOPEDIC CARE [4TH FLOOR], CRITICAL CARE AND CARDIAC PROGRESSIVE CARE [5TH FLOOR] AND MEDICAL UNITS [6TH FLOOR]), AND IMPROVING SPACE TO ALLOW FOR BETTER WHEELCHAIR MOBILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY.

IN RURAL AREAS, HOSPITALS EXPERIENCE STAFF AND PHYSICIAN SHORTAGES. LOCAL HOSPITALS ARE BEING FORCED TO CLOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE NONCOMPETITIVE. JUST RECENTLY, THE CLOSING OF TWO HOSPITALS IN THE MISSOURI SOUTHERN BOOTHEEL MADE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC FOR RESIDENTS. THE DECISION TO CLOSE THESE HOSPITALS WAS NOT BASED ON COMMUNITY NEEDS, BUT ON CORPORATE BUSINESS AND PROFIT CONSIDERATIONS.  MANY RESIDENTS OF THESE RURAL AREAS MUST TRAVEL EVEN LONGER DISTANCES TO REGIONAL HEALTH CARE CENTERS TO GET BASIC CARE, OFTEN IN EMERGENT SITUATIONS, SUCH AS ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION OR STROKE. MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PAYERS CONTINUE TO DECREASE PHYSICIAN AND HOSPITAL REIMBURSEMENT IN RURAL AREAS. MANY POORER AND UNDERSERVED PATIENTS IN RURAL AREAS RELY ON FEDERAL AID AND FUNDING FOR MEDICAL SERVICES, YET THESE FUNDS NO LONGER COVER THE COSTS INCURRED BY HEALTH SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE THESE BASIC SERVICES.  PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS OFTEN CHOOSE TO GO ELSEWHERE FOR CARE, HURTING THE LOCAL HOSPITAL\u2019S REVENUE BASE AND CONTRIBUTING TO PERCEPTIONS OF LOW QUALITY CARE FROM THE LOCAL HOSPITAL. WITHOUT URGENTLY NEEDED FACILITY UPGRADES AND EXPANSION OF SERVICES THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE, FURTHER WEAKENING THE HOSPITAL\u2019S PAYER MIX IN THE MISSOURI SOUTHERN BOOTHEEL AND REINFORCING LOCAL PERCEPTIONS. WITHOUT FURTHER INVESTMENTS, THE DEXTER HOSPITAL IS LEFT WITH HIGH RATES OF UNINSURED PATIENTS, AT LOWER REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE THAT ARE OFTEN BELOW COSTS. WITH INSUFFICIENT REVENUES TO MAINTAIN THEIR AGING FACILITIES, MISSOURI BOOTHEEL HOSPITALS WILL FURTHER DECLINE, LEADING I N TURN TO CONTINUING DETERIORATION OF THEIR FINANCES AND THE POTENTIAL OF ADDITIONAL CLOSURES.  IN ADDITION TO DECLINING REVENUE FOR THE SOUTHEAST MISSOURI BOOTHEEL HOSPITALS, THE REGION EXPERIENCES POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. HEART DISEASE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AND THE BOOTHEEL IS NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AS COLON AND BREAST CANCER HOT SPOTS (1). TO IMPROVE THIS TRAJECTORY, THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP IMPROVED THERAPEUTIC, DIAGNOSTIC AND REHABILITATION SERVICES.

IN FACT, COMMUNITY FEEDBACK SHOWS THAT AN ADDITIONAL 2,000 \u2013 3,000 WOMEN DESIRE TO HAVE THEIR BABIES AT MERCY ANNUALLY BUT CANNOT DUE TO THE LACK OF PHYSICAL SPACE AVAILABLE.  THE LIMITS OF PHYSICAL SPACE HAVE ALSO IMPACTED PROGRAMS, HOLDING BACK INNOVATION.

GAUDENZIA PROVIDES INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP COUNSELING, GED SUPPORT, EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL PLANNING AND REFERRAL, AA/NA MEETINGS, SPIRITUAL SUPPORT, MEDICAL AND LEGAL REFERRAL, FAMILY SUPPORT AND EDUCATION, HOUSING REFERRAL AND AFTERCARE SERVICES TO THE CLIENTS. SUCCESS BEGINS WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL STOPS ABUSING DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND HEIGHTENS WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL MOVES ON TO A HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIFE. UPON COMPLETION OF GAUDENZIA\u2019S PROGRAMS, CLIENTS HAVE CREATED A SUPPORT SYSTEM WITH PEERS, AA/NA MEETING MEMBERS, AND FAMILY MEMBERS. THEY HAVE A PLAN TO FOLLOW CREATED BY THEM IN CONSULTATION WITH THEIR COUNSELOR THAT INCLUDES PERSONAL, VOCATIONAL, AND HOUSING GOALS WITH PLANS TO ACCOMPLISH THEM OVER VARYING LENGTHS OF TIME.   THESE RENOVATIONS AND UPGRADES TO GAUDENZIA FRESH START\u2019S INTERIOR, EXTERIO R, AND OUTDOOR AREAS WILL PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENT TO FACILITATE THE CLIENTS\u2019 RECOVERY JOURNEY. THIS IS CRUCIAL AS THEY DEAL WITH DIFFICULT ISSUES, LEARN TOOLS FOR RECOVERY, AND BEGIN HEALING. A COMFORTABLE, SAFE, SECURE ENVIRONMENT ASSURES THE CLIENT THAT THE ORGANIZATION CARES FOR THEM. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY OF THEM WERE MARGINALIZED, ABUSED, OR MISTREATED AT SOME POINT IN THEIR JOURNEY PRIOR TO ENTERING TREATMENT. A WELL-KEPT ENVIRONMENT HELPS THEM REGAIN A SENSE OF SELF-WORTH.   ADEQUATELY INSULATED WINDOWS AND PROPERLY FUNCTIONING HVAC ARE ESSENTIAL TO A COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT. APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURES ENABLE CLIENTS TO FOCUS ON THEIR RECOVERY INSTEAD OF THEIR IMMEDIATE DISCOMFORT. THE BASEMENT IS CURRENTLY UNUSABLE SPACE. WITH FLOORING REPLACEMENT AND FRESH PAINT, IT WILL ALLOW FOR OFFICE SPACE AND STORAGE AREA USAGE. THE OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL AREA IS IMPORTANT TO CLIENTS\u2019 WELL-BEING AS WELL. THERE ARE AREAS WITH MISSING FENCING AND SOME FENCING HAS SHORT-TERM AND UNATTRACTIVE REPAIRS. BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM IS THE CLIENT\u2019S RESIDENCE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, AN OUTDOOR AREA THAT IS SAFE AND SECURE IS NEEDED FOR RECREATION AND RELAXATION. THE RETAINING WALL AT THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING IS BREAKING DOWN AND IN NEED OF POINTING AND REPAIRS TO ENSURE LONGEVITY AND SAFETY. THE RAILINGS OF THE STAIRCASE LEADING INTO THE MAIN ENTRANCE ARE IN POOR CONDITION AND NEED REPLACEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS\u2019 SAFETY.  GAUDENZIA\u2019S IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY IS A REDUCTION IN CRIME, HOMELESSNESS, AND BURDEN ON THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. GAUDENZIA FRESH START'S  ALUMNI ARE CHEFS, LAW CLERKS, CONTRACTORS, SALES PEOPLE, SOCIAL WORKERS, AUTO MECHANICS, HOMEOWNERS, BUSINESS OWNERS, SPOUSES, PARENTS, CHILDREN, AND TRUSTWORTHY FRIENDS.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS THAT USE THE CMC ED FOR THEIR CARE ROUTINELY HAVE DELUSIONS, HALLUCINATIONS AND HAVE A HIGH RATE OF CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY. THIS MAKES THEIR NEEDS VERY COMPLEX AND THEIR CAPABILITY TO FOLLOW TREATMENT RECOMM ENDATIONS IS OFTEN VERY POOR. THEY ARE FREQUENTLY UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED AT BEST.

THROUGH AN ONLINE SURVEY AND VIRTUAL LESSONS LEARNED SESSIONS, FEEDBACK WAS COLLECTED FROM CLINICIANS, MANAGERS, FACILITIES STAFF, INFECTION PREVENTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES (EVS/HOUSEKEEPING) STAFF ACROSS BJC'S MULTIPLE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. THIS PROCESS PROVED VALUABLE IN DETERMINING PRIORITIES FOR THE NEW TOWER. WHILE MANY ISSUES WERE RAISED, THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL ICU CAPACITY AND PATIENT ROOM NEGATIVE PRESSURE  CAPABILITIES RESOUNDED.  BJC IS PROPOSING, THROUGH THIS HRSA CDS GRANT REQUEST, SEVERAL ADDITIONS TO THE ORIGINAL PROJECT SCOPE TO ACHIEVE A MORE FLEXIBLE INPATIENT UNIT DESIGN THAT WILL ENABLE THE ORGANIZATION TO EFFECTIVELY USE THIS NEW INPATIENT TOWER TO ACCOMMODATE FUTURE PANDEMICS AND EPIDEMICS. CHANGES TO THE DESIGN OF THE MECHANICAL SYSTEMS WILL PROVIDE NEGATIVE PRESSURE CAPABILITIES AS WELL AS TO MAKE ALL ACUTE CARE ROOMS MEET CODE MINIMUM ICU CAPABILITY. THIS WILL ACHIEVE TWO KEY GOALS IN MAKING THE BUILDING PANDEMIC READY, AS THE NEED WAS DEMONSTRATED WITH COVID-19: 1. ISOLATE POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS PATIENTS  2. ACCOMMODATE A SUDDEN SURGE IN HIGHER ACUITY PATIENTS   WHEREAS THE TOTAL BJC CAMPUS RENEWAL PROJECT INCLUDES 2 ICU FLOORS AND 7 ACUTE CARE FLOORS, THIS HRSA CONSTRUCTION REQUEST ONLY INCLUDES PROJECTS FOR 1 ICU FLOOR AND 5 ACUTE CARE FLOORS.

THE PURPOSE OF PHASE 2 OF THE PROJECT IS TO REPLACE THE EXISTING EMERGENCY GENERATOR AND ITS FUEL STORAGE TANK (WHICH ARE OVER 41 YEARS OLD) THAT PROVIDE EMERGENCY BACKUP POWER TO KUAKINI'S LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN A BUILDING NEXT TO THE ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL.  THE PROJECT INCLUDES THE CONNECTION OF THE MEDICAL CENTER'S NEW EMERGENCY GENERATORS TO THE ADJACENT BUILDING THAT HOUSES KUAKINI'S SKILLED NURSING FACILITY, INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITY, AND RESIDENTIAL HOME, AS WELL AS (1) AN ACUTE CARE NURSING UNIT OPERATED BY ANOTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, THE QUEEN'S MEDICAL CENTER, (2) UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII JOHN A. BURNS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE'S HYPERBARIC TREATMENT CENTER, (3) UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII JOHN A. BURNS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE'S GERIATRIC MEDICINE DEPARTMENT, AND (4) AN OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS CENTER CURRENTLY IN CONSTRUCTION; AND THE REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING EMERGENCY GENERAT OR AND FUEL STORAGE TANK.  PHASE 2 OF THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF 96 HOURS OF EMERGENCY POWER AND PROVIDE FOR THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM FOR THE ENTIRE BUILDING.  THE FUNDING OF THIS PHASE 2 OF THE PROJECT WILL ASSURE THE CONTINUITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AT KUAKINI'S LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS DURING DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "HI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c74b2640-38b3-d7e3-beee-e37737f0f6df-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_CE146421_7526"}, {"internal_id": 151144314, "Award ID": "CE146420", "Award Amount": 0.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-02", "CFDA Number": "93.493", "Description": "COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING/CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING - CONSTRUCTION - ADDRESS:\t\t\t\tKOKUA KALIHI VALLEY COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY SERVICES \t\t\t\t\t2239 N.

THIS FUNDING WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARD THE FRONT ENTRYWAY PROJECT. THE FPC HOUSES FAMILY SERVICES\u2019 HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS OF 22 COMPLEMENTARY NONPROFITS MANY OF WHICH PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE SUN RIVER HEALTH, DUTCHESS COUNTY HEALTHY FAMILIES, DUTCHESS BEHAVIORAL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC, FINISH STRONG WELLNESS CENTER, AND FAMILY SERVICES' TRAUMA THERAPY AND COUNSELING, SNUG SOCIAL WORK AND CASE MANAGEMENT AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES. THE FPC SERVES AN ESTIMATED 70,000 INDIVIDUALS A YEAR WITH WELL OVER 110,000 SERVICE INTERACTIONS. WHILE MANY IN-PERSON REVITALIZATION EFFORTS WERE POSTPONED OR CANCELED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, THE FPC REMAINED OPEN AND THRIVING, THOUGH ADAPTED AND RESPONSIVE TO COVID-19.  BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS AFFECT NEARLY ONE IN FIVE AMERICANS AND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC INCREASED DEMAND FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. A RECENT POLL BY THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION FOUND THAT ALMOST 50 PERCENT OF PEOPLE REPORTED THAT CORONAVIRUS HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. THE IMPACT OF UNTREATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS ON AN INDIVIDUALS\u2019 LIFE AND PHYSICAL HEALTH INCREASES IN CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS, GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF EMERGENCY ROOM TREATMENT OR HOSPITALIZATION, AND DECREASED LIFE EXPECTANCY. IN 2021, FAMILY SERVICES IMPACTED THE LIVES OF 5,931 INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES.   ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTHCARE WHEN THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS LIKE WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC IS KEY. THROUGH A CLIENT SURVEY, FAMILY SERVICES FOUND THAT 89% OF CLIENTS FELT CONNECTED WITH THEIR COUNSELING OR MEDICAL STAFF DURING TELEHEALTH SESSIONS AND 77% FELT AS IF THEY WERE MAKI NG PROGRESS ON TREATMENT GOALS THROUGH TELEHEALTH. HOWEVER, CLIENTS ALSO EXPRESSED EAGERNESS TO RETURN TO AN IN-PERSON MODEL, PARTICULARLY RELEVANT, DUE TO THE FPC\u2019S CO-LOCATION OF COMPLEMENTARY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AS NOTED ABOVE. THE FPC\u2019S MODEL SUPPORTS A \u201cWARM HAND OFF\u201d BETWEEN RELATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, RATHER THAN \u201cCOLD REFERRALS,\u201d A MODEL THAT SUPPORTS BETTER PARTICIPATION RATES.  THE FPC IS ALSO HOST TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) THAT HAVE DIRECT BEARING ON THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THESE SDOH ARE ADDRESSED BY FPC PARTNER TENANTS THROUGH SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT; GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION; MINIMIZING HUNGER AND POVERTY; SERVICES TO MARGINALIZED YOUTH; AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES.  IN 2019, FAMILY SERVICES (OWNER AND MANAGER OF THE FPC) COMPLETED A MASTER CAPITAL PLAN.

GREENWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS COMPLETED IN 1935 AND NAMED FOR JAMES GREENWOOD, A NOTED MISSOURI EDUCATOR IN THE LATE 1800\u2019S. THE ARCHITECTS FOR THE SCHOOL WERE BONSACK AND PEARCE OF ST. LOUIS. THEY DESIGNED MANY EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES IN MISSOURI INCLUDING SEVERAL ON TRUMAN\u2019S CAMPUS. THIS PROJECT PRESERVES A LANDMARK BUILDING WHICH PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN EDUCATING CHILDREN IN KIRKSVILLE.  THE GREENWOOD PROJECT REPURPOSES A FORMER EXISTING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUILDING OF ABOUT 26,700 TOTAL SQUARE FEET. A STATE-FUNDED CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS UNDERWAY TO RENOVATE THE FIRST FLOOR AND ADD A SMALL ENTRY ADDITION WITH AN ELEVATOR. THE PROPOSED WORK FOR THIS FEDERALLY-FUNDED PROJECT WILL CONSIST PRIMARILY OF INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION; ASSOCIATED PLUMBING, MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL; FIXTURES AND FURNITURE FOR THE CLINIC SPACES; AND ROOFING REPLACEMENT. THE INTERIOR SPACES IMPACTED BY THIS PROJECT INCLUDE THE GYMNASIUM, GYMNASIUM STAGE AND SECOND FLOOR AND TOTAL ABOUT 12,300 SQUARE FEET. THE EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE EXISTING ASPHALT SHINGLE ROOF, ANY NEEDED REPAIRS TO THE SHEATHING OR TRIM AND MINIMAL LANDSCAPING.    IN THE EXISTING GYM, THE STAGE AND BLEACHER SEATING WILL BE REMOVED IN THEIR ENTIRETY TO PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM AVAILABLE FLOOR SPACE TO CREATE A MULTI-USE SPACE, INCLUDING AN INDOOR THERAPY PLAYGROUND. THIS SPACE WILL BE FINISHED WITH A MULTI-PURPOSE FLOORING SURFACE, APPROPRIATE FOR ITS VARIOUS INTENDED USES. THE SOUTHWEST VESTIBULE WILL BE RECONFIGURED TO ENSURE ADA ACCESS TO EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR DOORS. THE EXISTING CEILING WILL BE  REMOVED TO ACCOMMODATE NEW ACOUSTICAL CEILING PANELS, LED LIGHTING, AND SUPPORTING STRUCTURES FOR A VARIETY OF SUSPENDED THERAPY EQUIPMENT.   THE RECONFIGURED SECOND FLOOR WILL INCLUDE AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ROOM WITH KITCHEN EQUIPMENT, A MUSIC THERAPY ROOM WITH STORAGE, GRADUATE STUDENT OFFICE SPACE DESIGNED TO HOUSE MULTIPLE PEOPLE, A GRADUATE STUDENT SEMINAR ROOM, AND A PATIENT EXAMINATION POD. TWO STAIRWELL AREAS WILL BE RENOVATED TO PROVIDE ADDED SECURITY BETWEEN THE FLOOR LEVELS.  ONCE COMPLETE, THIS FACILITY, THE GREENWOOD INTERPROFESSIONAL AUTISM CENTER, WILL PROVIDE IN-DEPTH, INTERDISCIPLINARY ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM OR SUSPECTED AUTISM AS WELL AS OTHER NEURO-DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS. THE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH SERVICES CLINIC WILL BE STAFFED WITH LICENSED PROFESSIONALS, IN ADDITION TO SUPERVISED GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN HEALTH RELATED, ACADEMIC PROGRAMS.

THE STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITY WILL BE DEDICATED TO THE PROVISION OF ACCESSIBLE, HIGH-QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR WOMEN. THE CENTER, TO BE LOCATED AT REFUAHHEALTH, A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) THAT PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT ROCKLAND COUNTY AND THE LOWER HUDSON VALLEY IN NEW YORK, WILL FOCUS ON FERTILITY SERVICES, OFFERING WOMEN TREATMENT AND COUNSELING IN A LOCAL, CARING, AND COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENT. CONSISTENT WITH ITS MISSION AS AN FQHC, SERVICES AT THE CENTER WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL WOMEN, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY.   FUNDING WILL CONSTRUCT AN APPROX. 10,000 SQUARE FOOT FACILITY CONSISTING OF EXAM/CONSULT ROOMS, MAMMOGRAPHY, OUTPATIENT SURGICAL SPACE, AND AN EXPANDED MIDWIFERY-LED BIRTHING CENTER. KEEPING IN MIND THE DEEP EMOTIONAL ISSUES THAT CAN RESULT FROM INFERTILITY AND PREGNANCY LOSS, THE CENTER WILL BE DESIGNED WITH HOLISTIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES THAT WILL PROVIDE A SOOTHING AND PATIENT-FOCUSED EXPERIENCE.   NEED: ACCORDING TO AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA, APPROXIMATELY 15% OF ROCKLAND COUNTY WOMEN WILL FACE INFERTILITY. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO LOCAL OPTIONS FOR FERTILITY SERVICES IN ROCKLAND COUNTY. EVEN THOUGH NEW YORK IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPANSIVE STATES FOR FERTILITY HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE - AND THE ONLY STATE WHICH OFFERS COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID - THE LACK OF A  LOCAL OPTION MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ACCESS TREATMENT. FERTILITY TREATMENT IS OFTEN A TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS, WITH CAREFULLY TIMED TREATMENTS BEING REQUIRED DAILY FOR SUSTAINED PERIODS OF TIMES. THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE NEED TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK AND ARRANGE FAMILY CARE CAN MAKE TRAVEL TO OUT-OF-COUNTY PROVIDERS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AND PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. THIS IS ALL IN ADDITION TO THE EMOTIONAL BURDEN FERTILITY PLACES ON WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES.   SERVICES: THE CENTER WILL PROVIDE ACCESSIBLE FERTILITY CARE, HOUSE AN EXPANDED MIDWIFERY LED BIRTHING CENTER, AND OFFER COMPREHENSIVE WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES, MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, MAMMOGRAPHY, AND GYN OUT-PATIENT SURGERY. BRINGING ALL OF THESE SERVICES TOGETHER UNDER ONE ROOF, IN A PATIENT-CENTERED LOCATION, WILL ENHANCE REFUAH'S EXISTING CAPABILITIES AS AN FQHC AND ALLOW THE CENTER TO REACH THE UNDERSERVED WOMEN OF ROCKLAND COUNTY.   POPULATION GROUP(S) TO BE SERVED: REFUAHHEALTH IS A FEDERALLY-QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) SERVING LOW INCOME FAMILIES, LIVING AT OR BELOW 200% OF FPG. AS AN FQHC, IT IS ACCESSIBLE TO PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF OUTPATIENT WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES IN ROCKLAND COUNTY. OVER 80% OF ITS PATIENTS ARE COVERED BY MEDICAID. REFUAH OFFERS UNINSURED PATIENTS CARE ON A SLIDING-FEE SCALE, WITH PATIENTS BELOW 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL PAYING ONLY A NOMINAL FEE. NO PATIENT IS EVER TURNED AWAY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD CARE.  IN PARTICULAR, WOMEN OF COLOR AND WOMEN OF LOWER SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS ARE DISPARATELY IMPACTED BY THE LACK OF LOCAL  FERTILITY AND COMPREHENSIVE WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH OPTIONS. HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS, INCLUDING BIPOC AND LGBTQ COMMUNITIES, IN PARTICULAR, HAVE FACED HEIGHTENED BARRIERS TO ACCESSING FERTILITY TREATMENT.

THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FORCED AHS TO RETHINK ITS HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODEL FROM ONE ENTIRELY RELIANT ON PATIENTS HAVING FACE-TO-FACE VISITS TO ONE THAT NOW INCORPORATES TELEHEALTH VISITS AND TECHNOLOGY AS A CRITICAL WAY TO IMPROVE ACCESS.    AHS IS DEDICATED TO EXPANDING ITS TELEHEALTH ACTIVITIES AND PROMOTING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO DIGITAL TOOLS FOR OUR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.  AHS PATIENTS VALUE AND APPRECIATE TELEHEALTH VIDEO VISITS WHICH PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY AND CONVENIENCE BY ENABLING THEM TO ENGAGE IN CARE MORE OFTEN AND MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN IN-PERSON VISITS (E.G., ELIMINATES TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES).  AS A RESULT, DIGITAL HEALTH MUST INCREASINGLY BE INCORPORATED AS A STANDARD TOOL FOR PATIENT CARE.  AT THE SAME TIME, ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE HEALTH DISPARITIES AND WIDEN INEQUITIES DUE TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. PATIENTS CAN FACE TECHNOLOGY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES THAT PREVENT FULL ENGAGEMENT IN TELEHEALTH VIDEO VISITS SUCH AS LIMITED BROADBAND AND/OR INTERNET ACCESS, THE LACK OF A COMPUTER OR SMARTPHONE, AS WELL AS, INSUFFICIENT DIGITAL LITERACY.    RECOGNIZING THESE CHALLENGES, AHS PROPOSES TO USE THE CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING ALLOCATION OF $316,000 TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT THAT WILL ENHANCE AHS\u2019S TELEHEALTH AND DIGITAL PRESENCE, AND IMPROVE PATIENT ACCESS AND EXPERIENCE.  THE TELEHEALTH EXPANSION PROJECT HAS THREE COMPONENTS:    1.\tEXPAND TELEHEALTH VIDEO VISIT CAPABILITY:  CAPACITY WOULD BE EXPANDED BY CREATING VIRTUAL HUBS FOR DOCTORS/PROVIDERS TO CONDUCT VIDEO VISITS IN PRIVACY.  THE LACK OF SPACE, PRIVACY CONCERNS AND INADEQUATE TECHNOLOGY LIMIT ADOPTION OF VIDEO VISITS.  TEN (10) MOBILE EQUIPMENT WORKSTATIONS WOULD BE PURCHASED TO CREATE USABLE AND AGILE ENVIRONMENTS FOR PHYSICIANS TO CONDUCT VIDEO VISITS WITH PA TIENTS.  THE VIRTUAL HUBS WOULD BE LOCATED ON THE HIGHLAND HOSPITAL CAMPUS AND SUPPORT AMBULATORY OUTPATIENT SERVICES.        2.\tIMPLEMENT PATIENT PORTAL ACCESS FOR HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS:  THROUGH AHS\u2019S ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD, PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO A PATIENT PORTAL WHICH ENABLES THEM TO OBTAIN THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION, REQUEST SERVICES AND MONITOR THEIR HEALTH CONDITION(S).  HOWEVER, AHS DOES NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE PATIENT PORTAL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN THE HOSPITAL.  ONE HUNDRED (100) TABLETS, ASSOCIATED CASE/KEYBOARDS AND MEDICAL MOBILE CARTS WOULD BE PURCHASED AND PLACED IN HOSPITAL ROOMS FOR PATIENT USE.  WITH THESE TOOLS, PATIENTS COULD ACCESS THE PATIENT PORTAL AND OBTAIN SUCH INFORMATION AS THEIR TEST RESULTS, LIST OF HOSPITAL-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES, CURRENT MEDICATIONS.  THE MOBILE TABLET CARTS WOULD BE PLACED IN AHS\u2019S THREE ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS, NAMELY, ALAMEDA HOSPITAL, HIGHLAND HOSPITAL AND SAN LEANDRO HOSPITAL.  BY PROVIDING PATIENTS EASY ACCESS TO BEDSIDE DEVICES AND RESOURCES, THEY ARE NOT RELIANT ON BRINGING THEIR OWN DEVICES WHICH MAY OR MAY WORK DUE TO CONNECTIVITY ISSUES.       3.\tCREATE PATIENT KIOSKS:  PATIENT KIOSKS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE PATIENT EXPERIENCE, EXPEDITE VARIOUS CLINIC ACTIVITIES (SUCH AS PATIENT APPOINTMENT CHECK-IN/REGISTRATION, QUESTIONNAIRES) AND CREATE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES.  PATIENTS HAVE INCREASING EXPECTATION THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED TO REDUCE THEIR WAIT-TIME, PROVIDE THEM VITAL CLINICAL INFORMATION AND/OR FACILITATE A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THEIR CLINICIAN.

TO ELIMINATE THIS GAP, THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT (UVM) IS DEVELOPING AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY DOCTORAL (OTD) PROGRAM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND MOVEMENT SCIENCES IN THE COLLEGE OF NURSING AND HEALTH SCIENCES. THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL ON OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY EDUCATION (ACOTE) IS RECOGNIZED AS THE ACCREDITING AGENCY FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY EDUCATION BY BOTH THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE COUNCIL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION ACCREDITATION. ACOTE REQUIRES THAT OT PROGRAMS HAVE SPECIFIC LEARNING SPACES THAT CURRENTLY DO NOT EXIST AT UVM. THEREFORE, TO OFFER AN ACCREDITED OTD PROGRAM AT UVM, RENOVATIONS ARE NEEDED TO EXISTING BUILDINGS TO CREATE STATE-OF-THE-ART LABS (PEDIATRIC AND SMART APARTMENT), CLASSROOMS, AND OFFICES. THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS FUNDING TO DEVELOP THESE CRITICAL LEARNING SPACES. IN ADDITION TO SERVING THE OTD PROGRAM\u2019S EDUCATIONAL NEEDS, THESE LABS WILL SERVE AN ADDITI ONAL PURPOSE BY ALLOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERPROFESSIONAL TREATMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMMUNITY. THESE TREATMENT OPPORTUNITIES MAY INVOLVE AN INTERPROFESSIONAL TEAM WORKING WITH CHILDREN ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM OR BRINGING ELDERLY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY INTO THE LAB TO UTILIZE ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT AND IDENTIFY TOOLS THAT MAY ASSIST THEM IN THEIR HOME ENVIRONMENT. CREATING THESE INNOVATIVE LEARNING SPACES WILL ENABLE US TO EDUCATE OT STUDENTS, SERVE THE PUBLIC, AND OFFER INTERPROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS DISCIPLINES WITH OT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fb0c0b67-cf3f-8e71-00cf-883ce0aa9a3c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_CE146142_7526"}, {"internal_id": 150291474, "Award ID": "CE146141", "Award Amount": 5000000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-07-07", "CFDA Number": "93.493", "Description": "COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING/CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING - CONSTRUCTION - PROJECT DIRECTOR: DR.

ERIE COUNTY IS HOME TO ABOUT 75,000 PEOPLE, HOWEVER, ECHD/ECCHC ALSO SERVES THE SURROUNDING EIGHT COUNTIES, AND UP TO 10 MILLION ANNUAL VISITORS AND SEASONAL RESIDENTS WHO WORK IN THE RECREATION INDUSTRY. BY DEMOGRAPHICS, 86% OF ERIE COUNTY\u2019S POPULATION IS WHITE/CAUCASIAN, 8.9% ARE BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN, 4.5% ARE HISPANIC, AND 3% IDENTIFY A S TWO OR MORE RACES. ABOUT 60% OF RESIDENTS ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 AND 44, WHEN STATISTICS SHOW MANY ADDICTION ACTIVITIES BEGIN. NEARLY 10% HAVE NOT GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL, 10.5% HAVE DISABILITIES, AND 6.4% DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. THESE FACTORS LEAD TO RESIDENTS FACING HEALTH DISPARITIES (LOW-INCOME, UNDER-EDUCATED, MINORITY, DISABLED, AND MENTAL/BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES). BECAUSE THIS SUB-POPULATION BEARS THE HIGHER BURDEN OF HEALTH DISPARITIES/INEQUITIES THEY WILL DERIVE GREATER BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ERIE COUNTY RESIDENTS RECEIVE EITHER MEDICARE OR MEDICAID BENEFITS, AND ARE LIVING IN POVERTY MAKING THEM MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE BARRIERS TO CARE, HEALTH DISPARITIES, AND HOUSING INEQUALITIES. ERIE COUNTY HAS A POVERTY RATE OF 11.6%, AND SANDUSKY CITY, WHERE THE ECHD/ECCHC MAIN CAMPUS IS LOCATED, HAS A POVERTY RATE OF 22%. THIS ECONOMIC INSTABILITY FEEDS DIRECTLY INTO ADDICTION RATES AS THOSE WHO STRUGGLE TO FIND AND KEEP STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ARE ALSO AT HIGHER RISK OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. APPROXIMATELY 84% OF ERIE COUNTY JAIL INMATES ARE SUFFERING WITH MENTAL OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES; THESE INDIVIDUALS REQUIRE CARE, NOT INCARCERATION.
