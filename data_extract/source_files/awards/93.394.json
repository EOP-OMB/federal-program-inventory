MILLIONS OF MEN IN THE U.S. ALONE ARE CURRENTLY AT ELEVATED RISK FOR PCA, BUT THERE ARE NO EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES FOR SCREENING. ALTHOUGH MRI AS A SECOND-LINE SCREENING AND SCREENING OF HIGH-RISK MEN IS GRADUALLY INCREASING, MRI SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY ARE CURRENTLY INADEQUATE FOR LARGE-SCALE CLINICAL USE. THUS, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR NEW AND MORE ACCURATE NON-INVASIVE APPROACHES TO GUIDE THE BIOPSIES FOR CONFIRMING PCA. QUANTITATIVE MRI SOLUTIONS (QMIS), LLC HAS DEVELOPED MR VIRTUAL PATHOLOGY OF THE PROSTATE (MVP2) \u2013 A NEW QUANTITATIVE MRI ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION SOFTWARE TOOL FOR PCA SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS. MVP2 USES COMPARTMENTAL ANALYSIS OF HYBRID-MULTIDIMENSIONAL MRI (HM-MRI) DATA TO QUANTIFY VOLUME FRACTIONS OF THREE TISSUE SPACES: LUMEN, STROMA, AND EPITHELIUM. THIS PROVIDES NOVEL HM-MRI-BASED MARKERS OF PCA AS HIGH EPITHELIAL AND LOW STROMAL AND LUMINAL FRACTIONS INDICATE PCA. IN OUR PREVIOUSLY FUNDED NCI PHASE I STTR, WE ACCOMPLISHED ALL TECHNICAL AND LOGISTICAL R&D GOALS. SPECIFICALLY, WE SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND OPTIMIZED THE UNDERLYING COMPARTMENT MODEL TO MAXIMIZE AGREEMENT BETWEEN MVP2 AND THE GOLD STANDARD QUANTITATIVE HISTOLOGY AS WELL AS EVALUATION OF TISSUE COMPOSITION BY EXPERT PATHOLOGISTS. WE DEMONSTRATED THE ACCURACY OF MVP2 COMPARED WITH CLINICAL EVALUATION BASED ON PROSTATE IMAGING REPORTING AND DATA SYSTEM (PIRAD). IN ADDITION, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE FOR THE EFFICIENT EXECUTION OF OUR SOFTWARE. OUR SOFTWARE SOLUTION IS CONSISTENT WITH FDA REQUIREMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF PHASE I IS THE PROVEN FEASIBILITY OF MVP2 SOFTWARE FOR CLINICAL SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF PCA. THE GOALS OF THIS PHASE II PROPOSAL INCLUDE A) ENSURE SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIALIZATION AT SCALE BY DEVELOPING AND TESTING A CLOUD-BASED MVP2 THAT WORKS WITH LEADING MRI SCANNER BRANDS, B) DEMONSTRATE THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF MVP2 FOR GUIDING BIOPSY VIA MULTICENTER CLINICAL TRIAL, AND C) DEMONSTRATE THAT MVP2 WORKS WITH SCANNERS FROM THE 3 MAJOR MANUFACTURERS. THE RESULTS FROM PHASE II WILL PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE FOR THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF PCA SCREENING WITH MVP2\u2019. THIS WILL MAKE QMIS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE VAST MARKET FOR PCA SCREENING. MVP2 WILL HELP TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR MILLIONS OF MEN AT RISK OF PCA, LEADING TO REDUCED MISDIAGNOSIS AND OVERTREATMENT, INCREASED SURVIVAL DUE TO EARLY DETECTION, AND EFFECTIVE SCREENING EVEN WITH

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACKGROUND THE NON-INVASIVE DIAGNOSING OF BLADDER CANCER IN PATIENTS WITH HEMATURIA, THE MOST COMMON CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF BLADDER CANCER, OR IN SUBJECTS WITH A HISTORY OF BLADDER CANCER ON TUMOR SURVEILLANCE REMAINS A CHALLENGE, AND AS SUCH, THESE PATIENTS REQUIRE INVASIVE TESTING. CURRENT URINE-BASED ASSAYS ARE NOT ROBUST AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE USED TO \u2018RULE OUT\u2019 PATIENTS WHO DO NOT REQUIRE THESE INVASIVE TESTING. PREVIOUSLY, WE A) IDENTIFIED A BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSTIC PROTEIN \u201cFINGERPRINT\u201d COMPRISED OF 10 BIOMARKERS, B) DEVELOPED A MULTIPLEX IMMUNOASSAY TO QUERY THESE 10 BIOMARKERS IN VOIDED URINE SAMPLES AND C) PERFORMED ANALYTICAL VALIDATION OF THE MULTIPLEX IMMUNOASSAY. USING THE MULTIPLEX IMMUNOASSAY, WE HAVE GENERATED ENCOURAGING PRELIMINARY DATA IN 326 SUBJECTS (46 CANCER) NOTING A SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF 93%. THUS, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE POSSESS AN ACCURATE ASSAY THAT CAN BE USED TO \u2018RULE OUT\u2019 PATIENTS WHO DO NOT REQUIRE INVASIVE TESTING. FURTHERMORE, EARLY DETECTION (I.E., DETECTION PRIOR TO CLINICAL MANIFESTATION) IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL FOR PATIENTS AT RISK FOR BLADDER CANCER. AT PRESENTATION, MORE THAN 70% OF BLADDER CANCER CASES ARE NON- MUSCLE INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (NMIBC), WHILST THE REMAINING 30% ARE MUSCLE INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (MIBC) OR METASTATIC. WHEN DETECTED EARLY (I.E., NMIBC), THE 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE IS APPROXIMATELY 94%, COMPARED TO A 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE OF ~50% WHEN THE DISEASE IS DETECTED AS MUSCLE INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (MIBC), AND <20% WHEN THE DISEASE IS METASTATIC. HOWEVER, TO DATE, NO EARLY DETECTION ASSAY IS AVAILABLE. IN A SMALL COHORT OF 20 BLADDER CANCER PATIENTS AND 20 MATCHED CONTROLS FROM OUR ONGOING R01 STUDIES, WE HAVE NOTED AN ELEVATION IN OUR BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSTIC PROTEIN \u201cFINGERPRINT\u201d AS EARLY AS 18 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF BLADDER CANCER AND AN ACTUAL POSITIVE MULTIPLEX IMMUNOASSAY IN ALL BLADDER CANCER PATIENTS 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF BLADDER CANCER. HYPOTHESIS: A BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSTIC PROTEIN \u201cFINGERPRINT\u201d EXISTS THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF BLADDER CANCER IN NON- INVASIVELY OBTAINED URINE SAMPLES NOT ONLY AT THE TIME OF DIAGNOSIS, BUT PRIOR TO THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS OF BLADDER CANCER. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) TO VALIDATE THE MULTIPLEX IMMUNOASSAY FOR BLADDER CANCER DETECTION IN A LARGE, NESTED CASE-CONTROL STUDY (N=800) AND 2) TO EVALUATE THE MULTIPLEX IMMUNOASSAY FOR EARLY DETECTION IN A LARGE, NESTED CASE-CONTROL STUDY (N=600). SIGNIFICANCE THIS RESEARCH WILL OPEN THE DOOR FOR IMPROVING ON THE NON-INVASIVE METHODS FOR DETECTING BLADDER CANCER AND AS SUCH IT WILL HAVE A MARKED IMPACT ON PATIENT CARE. METHODOLOGY PREVIOUSLY, OUR GROUP HAS DISCOVERED AND PERFORMED EARLY VALIDATION OF BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSTIC PROTEIN\u201d FINGERPRINT\u2019 WITH EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING RESULTS.

SUCH ALGORITHMS CAN BE DEPLOYED IN FUTURE PROSPECTIVE STUDIES. EXPECTED RESULTS THERE EXISTS AN UNMET CLINICAL NEED FOR RELIABLE BIOMARKERS A) TO \u2018RULE OUT\u2019 WHICH PATIENTS WITH HEMATURIA OR ON BLADDER CANCER SURVEILLANCE DO NOT REQUIRE FURTHER EVALUATION AND B) TO EARLY DETECT BLADDER CANCER WHEN ITS MORE TREATABLE WITH IMPROVED SURVIVAL RATES.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO CLINICAL BIOMARKER TESTS AVAILABLE TO ASSESS RISK OF RECURRENCE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER (TNBC) PATIENTS OR HER2+ BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THESE PATIENTS ARE ALL TREATED WITH AGGRESSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY, AND OFTEN SUFFER FROM LONG-TERM ADVERSE SIDE-EFFECTS, BECAUSE ONCOLOGISTS HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHICH PATIENTS INHERENTLY HAVE A GOOD PROGNOSIS. WE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT EXPRESSION OF THE MHC CLASS II ANTIGEN PRESENTATION PATHWAY (MHCII) AND THE PRESENCE OF TUMOR INFILTRATING LEUKOCYTES (TILS) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL (DFS) IN TNBC AND HER2+ BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. WE DEVELOPED A MULTIGENE EXPRESSION ASSAY COMPATIBLE WITH FORMALIN FIXED PARAFFIN EMBEDDED BREAST TUMOR SPECIMENS THAT CAN ACCURATELY QUANTIFY MHCII EXPRESSION AND TILS TO GENERATE AN IMMUNE ACTIVATION SCORE FOR EACH PATIENT. WE CONFIRMED THAT THE IMMUNE ACTIVATION SCORE COULD IDENTIFY PATIENTS WHO HAVE A VERY LOW RISK OF RECURRENCE IN AN INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONAL COHORT. INTERESTINGLY, PATIENTS WITH HIGH MHCII AND TIL EXPRESSION HAVE LONG-TERM DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY RECEIVED CHEMOTHERAPY. ADDITIONALLY, MOUSE STUDIES SHOW THAT MHCII EXPRESSION IN TUMORS INCREASES TILS AND PROTECTS FROM RECURRENCE IN THE ABSENCE OF CHEMOTHERAPY, AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT TNBC PATIENTS WITH HIGH TILS HAVE IMPROVED DFS EVEN WITHOUT RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE MHCII IMMUNE ACTIVATION ASSAY CAN IDENTIFY TNBC AND HER2+ PATIENTS WHO HAVE A VERY LOW RISK OF RECURRENCE. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS UH3 PROPOSAL IS TO VALIDATE THAT THE MHCII IMMUNE ACTIVATION ASSAY CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY TNBC AND HER2+ BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WHO HAVE A VERY LOW RISK OF RECURRENCE BY ANALYZING CLINICAL TRIALS SPECIMENS IN A CLIA-CERTIFIED LABORATORY.

A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE IF THE ASSAY CAN IDENTIFY GOOD PROGNOSIS PATIENTS WHO DO EQUALLY WELL REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEIR CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMENS INCLUDE PACLITAXEL. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES INCLUDE DETERMINING IF HIGH IMMUNE ACTIVATION SCORES ARE PREDICTIVE OF PATHOLOGICAL COMPLETE RESPONSE TO NAC, AND DETERMINING IF MHCII IMMUNE ACTIVATION SCORES CHANGE AFTER NAC AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DFS.

THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT (TME) IS HIGHLY COMPLEX CONSISTING OF MULTIPLE CELL TYPES INCLUDING STROMAL CELLS, IMMUNE CELLS AND VASCULATURE. THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN TUMOR CELLS AND NEIGHBORING CELLS IN THE TME RESULTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES THAT CAN SUPPORT TUMOR GROWTH, VASCULARIZATION AND METASTASIS AND, THUS, PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROGNOSIS AND TREATMENT EFFICACY (E.G. BY MODULATING RESISTANCE). IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CLINICAL PRESCREENING MODELS TO INCLUDE THE TME TO ASSESS HOW TREATMENT EFFICACY CAN BE IMPACTED BY THIS MULTICELLULAR CROSSTALK. FOR MEN WITH ADVANCED CASTRATE RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER (CRPC) THAT HAVE PROGRESSED TO METASTASIS, THE DISEASE IS INVARIABLY LETHAL AS CURRENT THERAPIES ARE NOT CURATIVE. 90% OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE DEVELOPED BONE METASTASES BUT THE BONE MICROENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY DIFFICULT TO MODEL IN ANIMAL MODELS OR TRADITIONAL CO-CULTURE. THEREFORE, IN VITRO MODELS OF THE BONE MARROW TME ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO IMPROVE PRE-SCREENING OF NOVEL THERAPEUTICS, IMPROVE CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN, OUTCOMES AND EXPEDITE MUCH NEEDED TREATMENTS TO THE CLINIC. HERE WE PROPOSE TO CREATE A TISSUE CHIP MODEL OF THE BONE MARROW MICROENVIRONMENT FOR TESTING METASTATIC CRPC THERAPEUTICS. PATIENT-DERIVED PROSTATE TUMOR SPHEROIDS MODEL THE SOLID TUMOR EMBEDDED IN A COLLAGEN HYDROGEL SURROUNDED BY MULTIPLE RESIDENT BONE MARROW STROMAL CELLS DERIVED FROM BONE MARROW ASPIRATES, IMMUNE CELLS AND IPSC ENDOTHELIAL CELL VASCULATURE. CELL-SURFACE TARGETED THERAPIES, SUCH AS IMMU-132 HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR TREATMENT OF METASTATIC CANCERS. IMMU-132 IS AN ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE, WITH AN ANTIBODY AGAINST TROP 2, A RECEPTOR EXPRESSED ON TUMOR CELLS, COUPLED TO THE DRUG SN-38. SN-38 IS A TOPOISOMERASE INHIBITOR THAT INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN RAPIDLY PROLIFERATING CELLS.

THESE CHIPS WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE MECHANISMS OF TME-INDUCED TREATMENT RESISTANCE AND IDENTIFY SIGNATURES OF RESPONSE FOR USE IN STRATIFYING PATIENTS FOR MORE EFFICIENT CLINICAL TRIALS.

THIS HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION DEFICIENCY (HRD) PHENOTYPE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH PATHOGENIC BRCA MUTATIONS IN MULTIPLE CANCERS AND CAN BE EXPLOITED CLINICALLY THROUGH A SYNTHETIC LETHAL INTERACTION WITH AGENTS, SUCH AS INHIBITORS OF POLY ADP- RIBOSE POLYMERASE (PARP) AND CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMENS SUCH AS FOLFIRINOX, THAT INCREASE THE LEVEL OF DNA DAMAGE IN TUMOR GENOMES. STRIKINGLY, SUBSETS OF TUMORS THAT ARE WILD TYPE FOR BRCA1 AND BRCA2 HAVE SHOWN SIMILAR CLINICAL RESPONSES TO THESE AGENTS. PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT RESPONDER TUMORS HAVE ELEVATED NUMBERS OF GENOMIC ABERRATIONS EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF VARIANTS IN THE BRCA GENES OR IN OTHER MEDIATORS OF HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION MEDIATED DNA REPAIR (E.G. PALB2, ATM, AND BRIP1). THUS THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THESE LESIONS IN TUMOR GENOMES, REGARDLESS OF GENOTYPE, PROVIDES A BIOMARKER FOR PATIENTS WHO WILL RESPOND TO DNA DAMAGE AND REPAIR TARGETING THERAPIES.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IN 2019, 56,770 AMERICANS WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA (PDA) AND 45,750 WILL DIE FROM THE DISEASE, MAKING PDA THE THIRD MOST COMMON CAUSE OF CANCER DEATH. RECENT CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE MADE MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL SURVIVAL. STUDIES SUGGEST THAT SIMILAR TO OTHER TUMORS, ELEVATED NUMBERS OF CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATIONS DEFINE A HRD SIGNATURE IN A SUBSET OF PDAS. A FUNDAMENTAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THIS GENOMIC SIGNATURE PREDICTS THOSE PDA PATIENTS LIKELY TO RESPOND TO PARP INHIBITORS AND TO DNA DAMAGING AGENTS. HOWEVER PDA BIOPSIES ARE DIFFICULT TO CHARACTERIZE DUE TO COMPLEX GENOMES AND HETEROGENEOUS CELLULARITY, AS CANCER CELLS REPRESENT ON AVERAGE ONLY 25% OF THE CELLS WITHIN THE TUMOR. FURTHERMORE, BIOPSIES FREQUENTLY CONTAIN MULTIPLE NEOPLASTIC POPULATIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED BY MORPHOLOGY BASED METHODS.

DCE-MRI HAS BEEN UTILIZED TO NONINVASIVELY ASSESS EARLY THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE IN SOLID TUMORS BY DETECTING CHANGES IN TISSUE PERFUSION PRIOR TO ANATOMIC TUMOR SHRINKAGE. HOWEVER, MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY ACROSS DIFFERENT SCANNERS REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN IN MULTI-SITE TRIALS OF DCE-MRI. TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN, WE INVENTED THE P4 THAT IS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE IMAGED CONCURRENTLY IN THE BORE OF A STANDARD MRI SCANNER WITH A PATIENT, THUS CAN SERVE AS AN INTERNAL REFERENCE TO DETECT AND CORRECT THE SCANNER-DEPENDENT VARIATION IN QUANTITATING DCE-MRI PARAMETERS. WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE USE OF THIS DEVICE DECREASED VARIABILITY IN DCE-MRI MEASUREMENT TO ABOUT 4%, ALTHOUGH IT WAS ABOUT 20% BEFORE CORRECTION. WE NOW HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE P4 CAN HELP IDENTIFY EARLY THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE OF PANCREATIC TUMORS IN THE NEOADJUVANT SETTING. PANCREATIC TUMORS ARE TYPICALLY HYPO-PERFUSED, BUT WE HAVE RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TUMOR PERFUSION CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AFTER AN EFFECTIVE CHEMOTHERAPY. CHOOSING THE MORE EFFECTIVE THERAPY EARLY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR PATIENTS WITH BORDERLINE-RESECTABLE PANCREATIC CANCER, AS AN EFFECTIVE THERAPY CAN DOWNSTAGE A TUMOR TO ALLOW CURABLE SURGERY.

THE TREATMENT REGIMEN, HOWEVER, IS DIFFICULT FOR PATIENTS AS THEY EXPERIENCE HIGH RATES OF GRADE 3 OR HIGHER TOXICITIES INCLUDING LEUKOPENIA (42%) AND THE NEED FOR FEEDING TUBE (52%). RECENT STUDIES SHOWED THAT A SUBGROUP OF HNSCC PATIENTS WITH HUMAN-PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV)-POSITIVE OROPHARYNGEAL (OP) SCC HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PROGNOSIS. THESE CLINICAL DATA LEAD TO IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS TO DE-INTENSIFY TREATMENT FOR THIS LOW-RISK, YOUNGER POPULATION IN ORDER TO REDUCE ACUTE AND CHRONIC TOXICITY WITHOUT COMPROMISING DISEASE CONTROL. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE ADAPTIVE DE-ESCALATION OF TREATMENT CAN BE TAILORED FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS BASED ON THE EARLY TUMOR VOLUME CHANGE. HOWEVER, VOLUMETRIC ASSESSMENT IS OFTEN INADEQUATE BECAUSE THE TREATMENT RESPONSE OF A TUMOR CAN BE HETEROGENEOUS IN TERMS OF (I) CELL VIABILITY, (II) CELLULAR METABOLISM, AND (III) PERFUSION THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY CHEMORADIATION THERAPY. THESE COMPLEX CHANGES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED BY TUMOR VOLUME CHANGE AT THE EARLY STAGE. THE PROPOSED STUDY IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF THE QUANTITATIVE DIFFUSION MRI (DMRI) METHODS WITH THEIR OWN TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS THAT CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO OTHER CLINICAL STUDIES. DMRI IS A UNIQUE IN VIVO IMAGING TECHNIQUE SENSITIVE TO CELLULAR MICROSTRUCTURES AT THE SCALE OF WATER DIFFUSION LENGTH ON THE ORDER OF A FEW MICRONS. HOWEVER, QUANTITATIVE DMRI REMAINS CHALLENGING AS DMRI DATA REPRESENT DIFFERENT BIOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF TISSUE DEPENDING ON DIFFUSION WEIGHTING STRENGTH (Q) AND DIFFUSION TIME (T) USED FOR THE MEASUREMENT.

WE DEMONSTRATED THAT BOTH DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT D AND DIFFUSIONAL KURTOSIS COEFFICIENT K ARE PROMISING IMAGING MARKERS FOR CELL VIABILITY. CELLULAR METABOLISM CAN BE EVALUATED IN TERMS OF THE WATER EXCHANGE TEX, MEASURED BY THE DIFFUSION TIME-DEPENDENT K, THAT IS REGULATED BY THE ATP- DEPENDENT TRANS-MEMBRANE ION CHANNELS CO-TRANSPORTING WATER MOLECULES.

TO DATE, ONLY NEGATIVE GENETIC PREDICTORS (MUTANT KRAS/NRAS) OF EGFRI RESPONSE HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED CLINICALLY, CURRENTLY RESTRICTING EGFRI USE TO WILD-TYPE RAS/RAF SUBPOPULATIONS, AND MORE RECENTLY, JUST TO \u201cLEFT-SIDED\u201d LESIONS. WE RECENTLY REPORTED A NEW PROGNOSTIC ROLE FOR APC THAT RELATES TO THE NUMBER OF ALLELES MUTATED AND TO THE ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER MUTANT GENES SUCH AS KRAS AND TP53 (NAT COMMUN, 2016). FURTHER ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT MUTANT APC (A) GENOTYPES, IN COMBINATION WITH MUTANT TP53 (P), ARE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH A GENE EXPRESSION SIGNATURE MEASURING CETUXIMAB SENSITIVITY (CTX-S). THESE DATA LED TO THE PROVOCATIVE HYPOTHESIS THAT MUTANT APC + TP53 (AP) GENOTYPES TOGETHER---MORE SO THAN EITHER MUTANT GENE ALONE (A_ / _P), OR WILD-TYPE AP (_ _)---MAY HAVE A NEW ROLE IN POSITIVELY-PREDICTING EGFRI OUTCOMES (NAT COMMUN, UNDER REVIEW, 2018). THIS HYPOTHESIS IS BASED ON 3 KEY OBSERVATIONS WE HAVE RECENTLY MADE IN OUR COHORT AND IN TCGA DATA: (1) CTX-S SCORES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN: AP > A_ / _P > _ _ TUMORS IN BOTH WT AND MUT KRAS TUMORS; (2) AP MUTATIONS ARE MORE FREQUENT IN LEFT (CETUXIMAB-SENSITIVE) > RIGHT (CETUXIMAB-RESISTANT) CRC; (3) AP MUTATIONS ARE ALMOST NON-EXISTENT IN MSI TUMORS (HIGHLY CETUXIMAB-RESISTANT). THESE FINDINGS HAVE TWO POTENTIALLY HIGH-IMPACT CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: (1) THEY RE-DEFINE THE PATIENT SELECTION STRATEGY BY FURTHER RESTRICTING EGFRI THERAPIES TO WILD-TYPE RAS/RAF PATIENTS HARBORING AP MUTATIONS, THEREBY INCREASING RESPONSE RATES; (2) THEY COULD EXPAND THE THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PREVIOUSLY-EXCLUDED MUTANT KRAS/NRAS PATIENTS WHO HAVE AP MUTATIONS IN BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT CRCS. IF THE TEST FOR THESE MUTATIONS IS DEVELOPED AND CLINICALLY VALIDATED, THE UTILIZATION OF THESE DRUGS COULD BE EXPANDED TO ~25% MORE PATIENTS, INCLUDING MORE FIRST-LINE PATIENTS. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF CRC PATIENTS, AP MUTATIONS ARE NOT ASSESSED IN CURRENT PRACTICE. UNLIKE KRAS/NRAS ONCOGENES, BOTH A AND P ARE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES THAT CAN HAVE A MULTITUDE OF INACTIVATING MUTATIONS THAT MUST BE DETECTED.

THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEFINE ACCURATE PROGNOSTIC MARKERS FOR STAGE II-III MELANOMA PATIENTS BECAUSE ADJUVANT IMMUNOTHERAPY TO PREVENT RECURRENCE IS BOTH TOXIC AND EXPENSIVE. UNFORTUNATELY, CONVENTIONAL STAGING DOES NOT ALLOW FOR ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF RISK AND MANY \u201cLOW RISK\u201d PATIENTS IN FACT PROGRESS. FURTHER, WHILE THE IMMUNE TUMOR MICRO- ENVIRONMENT IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF OUTCOMES, STANDARD PATHOLOGIC ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES (TILS) IS SUBJECTIVE AND NOT APPLICABLE TO GENERAL CLINICAL PRACTICE. IN ORDER TO BETTER STRATIFY PATIENTS FOR ADJUVANT IMMUNOTHERAPY, WE SEEK TO VALIDATE A PREVIOUSLY DEFINED 53-GENE SIGNATURE. THIS SIGNATURE EMPLOYS NANOSTRING, A PROBE BASED TECHNOLOGY WELL SUITED TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE PARTIALLY DEGRADED RNA TYPICALLY RECOVERED FROM CLINICAL GRADE FFPE TISSUE SECTIONS. WE INITIALLY DEFINED THIS SIGNATURE IN A TRAINING SET AND THEN VALIDATED THESE FINDINGS IN AN INDEPENDENT TEST SET [SIVENDRAN, ET AL. (2014) J. INVEST. DERMATOL. 134:2202-11]. AS BOTH TRAINING AND TEST SETS POPULATIONS ARE RETROSPECTIVE, THE NEXT STEP TO DEVELOP A CLINICALLY APPLICABLE ASSAY IS TO TEST THE SIGNATURE ON PROSPECTIVELY GATHERED SAMPLES. GIVEN THE FACT THAT MELANOMAS CAN RECUR YEARS AFTER RESECTION IN THESE EARLY STAGE PATIENTS, PROSPECTIVE VALIDATION WOULD BE LENGTHY, AND THUS WE OPTED TO USE THE PROSPECTIVE RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS [PRA] APPROACH WHEREBY SAMPLES ARE COLLECTED AND ANNOTATED PROSPECTIVELY BUT ANALYZED RETROSPECTIVELY. FOR THIS PURPOSE WE USE SAMPLES FROM THE EASTERN COOPERATIVE GROUP (ECOG) E1697 STUDY OF ADJUVANT INTERFERON RANDOMIZED VS PLACEBO IN STAGE II-III RESECTED MELANOMA.

THE MILESTONE FOR MOVING TO THE UH3 PHASE (AIM 2) WILL BE SUBMISSION TO THE NYS CLINICAL LABORATORY EVALUATION PROGRAM.

THE GENERAL FINDING OF AN ASSOCIATION OF PD-L1 EXPRESSION WITH TUMOR RESPONSE TO ANTI-PD-1 THERAPY HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIATED ACROSS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS WITH NUMEROUS TUMOR TYPES TREATED WITH ANTI- PD-(L)1. HOWEVER, WHILE PD-L1 EXPRESSION ENRICHES FOR RESPONSE TO ANTI-PD-(L)1, IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE PATHOLOGISTS DEMONSTRATE GOOD REPRODUCIBILITY FOR SCORING TUMOR CELL (TC) PD-L1 EXPRESSION BY CHROMOGENIC IHC AND LIGHT MICROSCOPY, THEY HAVE POOR REPRODUCIBILITY FOR SCORING PD-L1 EXPRESSION ON IMMUNE CELLS (IC).  OTHER RELATED FEATURES WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE ON THE PD-L1 BIOMARKER INCLUDE THE PROXIMITY OF PD-1 TO PD-L1, THE DENSITY OF CD8+FOXP3+ CELLS, AND CD68 AND TUMOR MARKER IMMUNOSTAINS, THE LATTER OF WHICH HELP IDENTIFY CO-EXPRESSION OF PD-L1 ON ICS AND TCS, RESPECTIVELY. A QUANTITATIVE MULTIPLEX IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY WHICH CAPTURES ALL OF THESE FEATURES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND INCLUDES PD-L1, PD-1, CD8, FOXP3, CD68, A TUMOR MARKER (CYTOKERATIN AE1/3 FOR NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CARCINOMA, NSCLC), A PAN-MEMBRANE MARKER AND DAPI.

MDS IS A HETEROGENOUS GROUP OF CLONAL BONE MARROW DISORDERS THAT ARE OFTEN FATAL DUE TO MARROW FAILURE OR PROGRESSION TO ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML). ACCURATE PREDICTION PROGRESSION RISK IS THEREFORE CRITICAL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MDS PATIENTS IN ORDER TO PROLONG SURVIVAL AND MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH MORE AGGRESSIVE TREATMENTS. CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF BONE MARROW CELLS FROM MDS PATIENTS VIA METAPHASE KARYOTYPING IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF MDS RISK ASSESSMENT ALGORITHMS, AND IS USED TO DETECT CHROMOSOMAL DELETIONS, DUPLICATIONS, AND ANEUPLOIDIES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENTIAL CLINICAL OUTCOMES. ALTHOUGH KARYOTYPING HAS BEEN USED EFFECTIVELY FOR DECADES, IT HAS SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES. THESE INCLUDE LOW GENOMIC RESOLUTION AND HIGH FAILURE RATES THAT CAN RESULT IN INCOMPLETE GENETIC RISK PROFILES FOR SOME PATIENTS.

THESE FINDINGS INCLUDED NEW RISK-DEFINING CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES IN ALMOST 15% OF PATIENTS, WHICH RESULTED IN BETTER PREDICTION OF CLINICAL OUTCOMES.

TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL CLINICAL NEED, WE HAVE COMBINED OUR EXPERTISE IN THYROID CANCER/SURGERY (DR. JAMES SULIBURK, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, BCM), MASS SPECTROMETRY IMAGING (DR. LIVIA S. EBERLIN, DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN), STATISTICAL ANALYSIS (DR. ROB TIBSHIRANI, DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE, STANFORD UNIVERSITY), CLINICAL CHEMISTRY (DR. RONGRONG HUANG, SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY, BCM), AND CLINICAL PATHOLOGY (DR. THOMAS WHEELER, DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, BCM), AND DEVELOPED AN ASSAY USING MASS SPECTROMETRY IMAGING AND MACHINE LEARNING TO DIAGNOSE FNA BIOPSIES BASED ON THE DETECTION OF A PROFILE OF HUNDREDS OF METABOLIC MARKERS DIRECTLY FROM CLINICAL SPECIMENS. NOW, WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT CRITICAL ANALYTICAL AND CLINICAL VALIDATION STUDIES WITH FNA BIOPSIES PROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED FROM PATIENTS UNDERGOING TREATMENT AT BCM TO RIGOROUSLY VALIDATE THE METHOD FOR CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATION. DURING THE UH2 RESEARCH PHASE, WE WILL ESTABLISH KEY ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE METRICS, QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES, AND METHOD STANDARDIZATION PROCEDURES TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR ASSAY AND METABOLIC MARKERS WITHIN ITS CLINICAL CONTEXT OF USE. DURING THE UH3 RESEARCH PHASE, WE WILL VALIDATE THE CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE FOR FNA DIAGNOSIS IN COMPARISON TO GOLD STANDARD PATHOLOGIC EVALUATION. OUR PREMISE IS THAT THE RIGOROUS STUDIES PROPOSED WILL COMPLETE THE ANALYTICAL AND CLINICAL TASKS NEEDED TO VALIDATE OUR ASSAY AND PREDICTIVE MARKERS FOR THYROID FNA DIAGNOSIS, THUS DEMONSTRATING ITS EFFECTIVENESS AS A DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY. WITH SUPPORT FROM COMMERCIAL PARTNERS, OUR ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP THIS INNOVATIVE METABOLIC TEST INTO A ROBUST TECHNOLOGY FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT AND ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF THYROID FNA MATERIAL.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ddcd398f-5e59-e840-2368-a57b84efdc7d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UH2CA267829_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151588970, "Award ID": "UH2CA267502", "Award Amount": 414790.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-01", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "PURSUING MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS TO GUIDE ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR HPV+ HEAD AND NECK CANCERS AFTER TRANSORAL ROBOTIC SURGERY - PROJECT SUMMARY THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO OPTIMIZE THERAPY FOR HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS-RELATED (HPV+) SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS OF THE HEAD AND NECK (HNSCCS), WHICH ARE RAPIDLY INCREASING IN INCIDENCE. THE RELATIVELY FAVORABLE PROGNOSIS FOR THE HPV+ SUBTYPE OF HNSCC HAS JUSTIFIED ONGOING EFFORTS TO DE-INTENSIFY THEIR TREATMENT WITH HIGH DOSE RADIATION AND CISPLATIN, WHOSE TOXICITIES CAN LEAVE LIFELONG DISABILITIES IN SURVIVORS. A RECENTLY POPULARIZED APPROACH TO THERAPY DE-ESCALATION IS TRANSORAL ROBOTIC SURGERY (TORS), WHICH HAS MARKEDLY ALTERED PRACTICE PATTERNS FOR THIS DISEASE AND ALLOWED FOR REDUCTION IN CISPLATIN USE AND RADIATION DOSING RELATIVE TO NONSURGICAL THERAPY. HOWEVER, POOR ABILITY TO STRATIFY RECURRENCE RISK AFTER TORS IS A KEY BARRIER TO BOTH SAFELY DE-ESCALATING ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR TYPICAL HPV+ HNSCCS AND INTENSIFYING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN CASES THAT ARE PREDISPOSED TO LETHAL OUTCOME. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP BY LEVERAGING A UNIQUE SET OF ARCHIVAL HPV+ HNSCC SPECIMENS FROM PATIENTS TREATED BY TORS TO PURSUE NOVEL MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS. OUR STUDIES OF OLDER COHORTS WITH WIDELY VARIABLE TREATMENT SUGGEST WORSE OUTCOMES FOR HPV+ HNSCCS WITH HIGH OXIDATIVE METABOLIC GENE EXPRESSION, REDUCED E2F TARGET GENE UPREGULATION, AND LOWER VIRAL E6 ONCOGENE EXPRESSION. THUS, OUR OVERALL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT GENETIC VARIANTS AND EXPRESSION PROFILES OF BOTH HOST AND VIRAL GENES WILL ALLOW PROSPECTIVE DISCRIMINATION OF HPV+ HNSCCS AT RISK OF LETHAL OUTCOME AFTER TORS-BASED THERAPY. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, AIM 1 WILL IDENTIFY HOST AND VIRAL EXPRESSION PROFILES DISTINGUISHING HPV+ HNSCCS THAT RECUR AFTER TORS. CASE-CONTROL ANALYSES WILL BE APPLIED TO A COHORT OF 634 TORS-TREATED HPV+ HNSCCS WITH UNIQUELY LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY VIRAL AND HOST GENES DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED IN TUMORS THAT LATER RECURRED. RECURRENT CASES WILL BE MATCHED TO NONRECURRENT CONTROLS BASED ON STAGE, ADJUVANT THERAPY, AND FOLLOW-UP. TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY PROTEIN LEVEL VALIDATION FOR SELECT DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES. AIM 2 WILL DEFINE GENETIC TRAITS OF HPV+ HNSCCS THAT RECUR AFTER TORS AND PURSUE A MULTI-MARKER STRATIFIER OF RECURRENCE RISK. WHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY SOMATIC MUTATIONS AND COPY NUMBER ALTERATIONS THAT DISTINGUISH TUMORS THAT RECURRED FROM NONRECURRENT CONTROLS. IN ADDITION, VIRAL GENOME SEQUENCING WILL BE USED TO ASSESS FOR VIRAL SUBTYPES, SUB-LINEAGES, AND NONSYNONYMOUS SNPS THAT ARE OVER-REPRESENTED IN RECURRENCE-PRONE TUMORS. GENETIC TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT FAILURE WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATA TO DEVELOP A MULTI-MARKER SIGNATURE THAT STRATIFIES HPV+ HNSCCS FOR LETHAL RECURRENCE RISK. THIS ASSESSMENT OF MOLECULAR TRAITS THAT DISTINGUISH TUMORS WITH HIGH RECURRENCE RISK AFTER TORS-BASED THERAPY WILL CREATE A DISCRETE PANEL OF MOLECULAR FEATURES THAT CAN BE TESTED IN LARGE COHORTS, LEADING TO CREATION OF STRONG PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS UNDER A MODERN TREATMENT PARADIGM FOR HPV+ HNSCC.

UNFORTUNATELY, VIRTUALLY ALL PATIENTS EVENTUALLY DEVELOP RESISTANCE TO THESE INHIBITORS, OFTENTIMES THROUGH ACQUISITION OF SECONDARY FGFR MUTATIONS. FGFR INHIBITOR DEVELOPMENT IS HINDERED BY THE LACK OF ACCURATE AND COMPREHENSIVE METHODS TO 1) RAPIDLY DETECT FGFR ALTERATIONS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY PATIENTS FOR CLINICAL TRIALS, 2) MONITOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE, AND 3) CHARACTERIZE EMERGING DRUG RESISTANCE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TESTING STRATEGIES, SUCH AS NON-INVASIVE LIQUID BIOPSIES, CAN FULFILL THESE UNMET NEEDS FOR DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS, AND THERAPY SELECTION. LIQUID BIOPSIES EVALUATE A BLOOD SAMPLE, FROM WHICH CELL-FREE DNA (CFDNA) SHED BY THE TUMOR IS SEQUENCED TO DETECT GENOMIC ALTERATIONS.

SCCHN INCLUDES SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS DERIVED FROM ORAL CAVITY, TONGUE, PHARYNX AND LARYNX. IT IS THE 7TH MOST COMMON CANCER IN US AND WORLDWIDE BY INCIDENCE, AND THE 3RD IN US AND 4TH WORLDWIDE BY 5-YEAR PREVALENCE. SCCHN IS A BIOLOGICALLY AGGRESSIVE CANCER IN WHICH HIGH RATES OF RECURRENCE (LOCAL, LOCOREGIONAL OR DISTANT) CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO POOR PATIENT SURVIVAL. CURRENT CLINICAL PRACTICE METHODS FOR DETECTION OF SCCHN RECURRENCE ARE EITHER SUBJECTIVE, INVASIVE, HARD TO ACCESS, NOT ABLE TO DETECT RECURRENCE IN A TIMELY MANNER OR EXPENSIVE. THERE IS AN UNMET MEDICAL NEED FOR AN OBJECTIVE, NON-INVASIVE, EASY TO ACCESS TEST THAT IS ABLE TO DETECT SCCHN RECURRENCE IN A TIMELY AND A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY. OUR SOLUTION IS \u201cHNKLEAR\u201d, A NON- INVASIVE, SALIVA-BASED CANDIDATE TEST FOR EARLY DETECTION OF SCCHN RECURRENCE. HNKLEAR INCORPORATES A 7- METHYLATED MICRORNA BIOMARKER PANEL. THE REAL-TIME NATURE OF OUR TEST WILL PROVIDE MORE TIMELY AND PRECISE DETECTION OF SCCHN RECURRENCE.

THIS BIOMARKER ASSAY WILL EVALUATE A GENE EXPRESSION SIGNATURE OF TREATMENT RESISTANT, CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER (CRPC). WHILE MANY PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER BENEFIT FROM ANDROGEN RECEPTOR SIGNALING INHIBITORS (ARSIS), A SUBSET OF PATIENTS DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS CLASS OF TREATMENTS WHILE NEARLY ALL OTHERS DEVELOP RESISTANCE WITHIN 1-2 YEARS. IDENTIFIED MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF NEUROENDOCRINE PROSTATE CANCER (NEPC) AND EXPRESSION OF ANDROGEN RECEPTOR SPLICING VARIANTS (AR-VS). EARLY DETECTION OF NEPC OR AR-VS AS DRIVERS OF TREATMENT RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED TO WAIT FOR CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF RESISTANCE, ACCELERATING THE TIME TO ADMINISTRATION OF MORE SUITABLE THERAPY AND INCREASING SURVIVAL. WHILE PRECISION MEDICINE APPROACHES ARE INCREASING IN POPULARITY AND RELIABILITY, THEIR ULTIMATE CAPACITY TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE HINGES ON THEIR DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY. REALIZATION OF A CLINICALLY RELEVANT ASSAY REQUIRES THOROUGH ANALYTICAL AND CLINICAL EVALUATION, AND WHILE MANY BIOMARKER ASSAYS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE, FAILURE TO ADDRESS CLINICAL UTILITY HAS LEFT MANY UNABLE TO IMPROVE ON EXISTING DIAGNOSTICS. BY FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS ON EVALUATION OF BOTH ANALYTICAL AND CLINICAL VALIDITY, WE AIM TO PROVIDE DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY IN ASSESSING AN EXPRESSION OF NEPC AND AR-VS, BUILDING A NECESSARY FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS. TO THAT END, WE HAVE OPTIMIZED A MULTI-PLEXED GENE EXPRESSION ASSAY ON CTCS, THAT IDENTIFIES THESE TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES OF RESISTANCE TO ARSIS. THIS ASSAY HAS SHOWN PROMISING INITIAL RESULTS IN A PRELIMINARY COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH AGGRESSIVE CRPC.

REDUCE TOXICITY FOR PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIATION AND IMMUNOTHERAPY - THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS IN THE FIELD OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY. LUNG CANCER PATIENTS THAT GET TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY ARE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING SERIOUS LUNG SIDE-EFFECTS, AND IN PARTICULAR, PNEUMONITIS. PNEUMONITIS RESULTS IN COUGH, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, AND CAN BE FATAL. PNEUMONITIS, IS A SERIOUS, OVERLAPPING TOXICITY THAT CAN RESULTS AS A FUNCTION OF BOTH RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY. PNEUMONITIS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PATIENT QUALITY OF LIFE AND LIMITS THE AGGRESSIVE COMBINATIONS OF THERAPIES THAT CAN BE EVALUATED IN CLINICAL TRIALS. STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED THAT CAN REDUCE PNEUMONITIS RATES FOR PATIENTS TREATED WITH AGGRESSIVE COMBINATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY IN CLINICAL TRIALS. A NOVEL LUNG FUNCTION IMAGING MODALITY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT USES DATA ACQUIRED AS PART OF ROUTINE CLINICAL CARE FOR LUNG CANCER PATIENTS ALONG WITH SOFTWARE TECHNIQUES TO INNOVATIVELY CALCULATE LUNG FUNCTION MAPS. THE NOVEL LUNG FUNCTION IMAGING MODALITY HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO RADIOTHERAPY THROUGH A PERSONALIZED, FUNCTIONAL AVOIDANCE RADIATION TREATMENT PARADIGM. THE IDEA OF FUNCTIONAL AVOIDANCE IS TO DESIGN RADIATION TREATMENT PLANS THAT REDUCE DOSE TO FUNCTIONAL PORTIONS OF THE LUNG WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT REDUCED DOSE TO FUNCTIONAL LUNG WILL LEAD TO DECREASED SIDE-EFFECTS FROM TREATMENT AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. IMAGING-BASED FUNCTIONAL AVOIDANCE PROVIDES A PROMISING METHOD FOR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING TOXICITY FOR LUNG CANCER PATIENTS WHO GET TREATED WITH COMBINATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE NOVEL LUNG FUNCTION IMAGING METHODS HAVE NOT BEEN DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED WITH IMMUNOTHERAPY ADDED TO THE TREATMENT PARADIGM.  THE PURPOSE OF OUR PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL METHODS THAT ENABLE THE EVALUATION OF IMAGING-BASED FUNCTIONAL AVOIDANCE FOR PATIENTS ENROLLED IN RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY CLINICAL TRIALS. OUR STUDY WILL DEVELOP METHODS THAT PROVIDE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF LUNG FUNCTION (PERFUSION IMAGING IN ADDITION TO VENTILATION), EVALUATE THE MOST STABLE AND CLINICALLY RELEVANT FORM OF LUNG FUNCTION IMAGING, AND PERFORM A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF HOW VARIOUS FUNCTIONAL PARAMETERS EFFECT RADIATION TREATMENT PLANS FOR PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY. OUR STUDY WILL USE DATA FROM 4 CLINICAL TRIALS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE PROPOSED IMAGING FRAMEWORK CAN REDUCE TOXICITY FOR LUNG CANCER PATIENTS IN THE SETTING OF IMMUNOTHERAPY ADDED TO THE TREATMENT PARADIGM.  MORE AGGRESSIVE COMBINATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND BE INVESTIGATED IN CLINICAL TRIALS. PULMONARY TOXICITY WILL BE A SERIOUS CLINICAL LIMITATION FOR THESE STUDIES. OUR PROJECT PROPOSES A CONVENIENT, INEXPENSIVE IMAGING MODALITY TO REDUCE TOXICITY AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE OF LUNG CANCER PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY. THE IMPACT OF OUR IMAGING FRAMEWORK IS THAT IT CAN 1) REDUCE TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE-EFFECTS FOR PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY AND 2) ENABLE THE INVESTIGATION OF MORE-AGGRESSIVE RADIOTHERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR LUNG CANCER PATIENTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8668e79f-a6ac-f586-b519-d1e69f717615-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UG3CA247605_7529"}, {"internal_id": 126271061, "Award ID": "UG3CA239861", "Award Amount": 770584.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-02-18", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "BREAST CANCER INTRAVOXEL-INCOHERENT-MOTION MRI MULTISITE (BRIMM) STUDY - RESUBMISSION - 1 - PROJECT SUMMARY WHILE THE TECHNOLOGICAL ENTERPRISE OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) GENERATES A HOST OF BIOMARKERS OF THE TUMOR ENVIRONMENT, IN PARTICULAR FOR BREAST CANCER, PRECIOUS FEW (AND TYPICALLY ONLY FIRST-ORDER MARKERS) HAVE BEEN TESTED BEYOND SINGLE SITE STUDIES WITH SINGLE WORKFLOW PROCESSING.

THE SCIENTIFIC APPROACH OF OUR CENTER IS BASED ON SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. FIRST, THAT ALTERED CANCER PROTEIN EXPRESSION, STRUCTURE, AND POST- TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS INDUCE HOST AUTOANTIBODIES TO CREATE CIRCULATING BIOMARKERS. SECOND, THAT ALTERATIONS IN MICROBIAL ANTIGEN EXPRESSION (SUCH AS RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS) ALSO INDUCE IMMUNITY, OFTEN DETECTED IN BENIGN RATHER THAN MALIGNANT DISEASE. THIRD, THAT THE PROTEIN MODIFICATIONS, AS WELL AS THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO THESE NEOANTIGENIC STRUCTURES, ARE HETEROGENEOUS BETWEEN PEOPLE, AND THAT SEROLOGIC BIOMARKERS MAY COMPLEMENT CIRCULATING PROTEIN BIOMARKERS. WE WILL TAKE A SYSTEMS IMMUNOLOGY APPROACH TO DISCOVER THREE TYPES OF ANTIBODIES, ANTI-MICROBIAL ANTIBODIES, AUTOANTIBODIES AND ANTI-ABERRANT GLYCOPROTEIN ANTIBODIES. OUR PROPOSAL BUILDS ON OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCES WITH CANCER BIOMARKER DISCOVERY AND IMMUNOPROTEOMICS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. OUR PREVIOUS RESULTS ON AUTOANTIBODY BIOMARKERS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED IN BLINDED PHASE 2 MULTICENTER VALIDATION STUDIES AND LED TO A CLIA-CERTIFIED COMMERCIAL BLOOD TEST. OUR RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THAT MULTIPLEXED PANELS OF AUTOANTIBODIES ARE REQUIRED FOR ADEQUATE PREDICTIVE VALUE. WITH PRIOR EDRN SUPPORT, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SET OF INNOVATIVE IMMUNOPROTEOMICS TECHNOLOGIES, NAMELY HIGH-DENSITY NUCLEIC ACID PROGRAMMABLE PROTEIN ARRAY (HD-NAPPA), CONTRA-CAPTURE PROTEIN ARRAY (CCPA) AND MULTIPLEXED IN SOLUTION PROTEIN ARRAY (MISPA), THAT, TOGETHER WITH THE LARGEST FULL-LENGTH HUMAN AND MICROBIAL GENE COLLECTION AT OUR DNASU PLASMID REPOSITORY, ENABLE US TO STUDY ANTIBODIES AGAINST THE FULL HUMAN PROTEOME, MICROBIAL PROTEOMES AND THE HUMAN O-GLYCOPROTEOME FOR ANTIBODY BIOMARKER SIGNATURES IN CANCER.

SANDA PI), WE DEVELOPED, VALIDATED, AND CLINICALLY IMPLEMENTED MYPROSTATESCORE (MPS), AN EARLY DETECTION TEST INCORPORATING URINE QUANTIFICATION OF TWO PROSTATE CANCER-SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTS\u2014THE TMPRSS2:ERG GENE FUSION AND THE LONG NON-CODING RNA (LNCRNA) PCA3. INTRODUCED IN OUR CLIA LABORATORY, MPS INFORMS SHARED DECISION MAKING AFTER PSA TESTING BASED ON INDIVIDUALIZED RISK PREDICTIONS OF AGGRESSIVE PROSTATE CANCER ON BIOPSY. HERE, PAIRING THE CANCER-SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE MPS TEST WITH RECENT DISCOVERY OF HIGH-GRADE CANCER-SPECIFIC BIOMARKERS, WE OUTLINE THE DEVELOPMENT, OPTIMIZATION, AND CLINICAL VALIDATION OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS \u2013 CAPABLE OF RELIABLY, SELECTIVELY DETECTING POTENTIALLY LETHAL CANCERS THAT STAND TO BENEFIT FROM EARLY CURATIVE TREATMENT. OUR BIOMARKER DEVELOPMENTAL LABORATORY (BDL) WILL EMPLOY THE EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORM, MPS-SEQ, FOR CAPTURE RNA-SEQ ANALYSIS OF URINE SAMPLES TO DETECT AGGRESSIVE PROSTATE CANCER TRANSCRIPTS, LNCRNAS, CIRCULAR RNAS, FUSION TRANSCRIPTS, MUTATIONS, INDELS, AND SPLICE VARIANTS. OUR BIOMARKER REFERENCE LABORATORY (BRL) WILL IN PARALLEL DEVELOP A CLINICAL GRADE URINE ASSAY, MPS-50, FOR THE MULTIPLEX QPCR ANALYSIS OF UP TO 50 AMPLICONS. WHILE THE FIRST 50 AMPLICONS OF MPS-50 HAVE ALREADY BEEN NOMINATED, FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS OF THE ASSAY CONTENT AND PLATFORM WILL BE INFORMED BY WORK CARRIED OUT IN OUR BDL. TO FUEL THESE STUDIES, OUR BCC HAS IDENTIFIED URINE BIOSPECIMEN COHORTS COLLECTED UNDER RIGOROUS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES IN COMPLIANCE WITH PROBE CRITERIA INCLUDING THE MICHIGAN PROSTATE SPORE, EMORY UNIVERSITY, THE CENTER FOR PROSTATE DISEASE RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO HEALTH, EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL, AND VUMC/MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE. THE OVERALL AIMS OF THIS BCC SERVE TO DEVELOP, ASSESS, AND OPTIMIZE MPS-SEQ AND MPS-50 FOR IDENTIFYING HIGH-GRADE PROSTATE CANCER IN DIVERSE AT-RISK POPULATIONS. OUR BRL WILL ALSO FOCUS ON STANDARDIZING CLINICALLY-VALIDATED BIOMARKER ASSAYS FOR CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE USE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CLIA/CAP GUIDELINES AT THE U-M CENTER FOR TRANSLATIONAL PATHOLOGY IN ORDER TO FACILITATE NETWORK CONSORTIUM STUDIES AND AT LYNXDX IN ORDER TO SCALE, COMMERCIALIZE, AND OBTAIN FDA APPROVALS. AS RECOGNIZED BY THE EDRN, NOVEL BIOMARKERS SPECIFIC FOR AGGRESSIVE PROSTATE CANCER ARE URGENTLY NEEDED.

QI EFFORTS HAVE POSITIONED IMAGING AS A KEY ELEMENT IN THE DESIGN OF CLINICAL TRIALS FOR CANCER THERAPY RESPONSE ASSESSMENT. HENCE, THERE IS INCREASED INTEREST BY THE ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY SECTORS TO USE WEB ACCESSIBLE RESEARCH RESOURCES AND DEVELOP CONSENSUS APPROACHES TO VALIDATE QI METHODS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF CLINICAL TRIALS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR ASSESSMENT OF CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY, SINCE IMMUNOTHERAPY DOES NOT LEAD TO A DECREASE IN TUMOR SIZE, AT LEAST NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE POST-TREATMENT PHASE. THEREFORE, WE URGENTLY NEED NEW QI TOOLS THAT CAN MONITOR TUMOR RESPONSE TO NOVEL IMMUNOTHERAPIES. THE OVERALL GOAL OF OUR PROJECT IS TO OPTIMIZE AND VALIDATE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL IMAGING TECHNIQUES FOR IN VIVO QUANTIFICATION OF TUMOR ASSOCIATED MACROPHAGES (TAM) IN OSTEOSARCOMAS. RECENT EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE ABUNDANT TAM RESPONSE IN THE MICROENVIRONMENT OF BONE SARCOMAS CAN BE EMPLOYED TO DIRECTLY ATTACK CANCER CELLS.

TO SOLVE THE UNMET CLINICAL NEED FOR A QI TOOL TO MONITOR RESPONSE TO NEW TAM- MODULATING THERAPIES, OUR TEAM DEVELOPED A QUANTITATIVE TAM IMAGING TEST, WHICH RELIES ON INTRAVENOUS INJECTION OF THE IRON SUPPLEMENT FERUMOXYTOL. FERUMOXYTOL IS COMPOSED OF IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES, WHICH ARE PHAGOCYTOSED BY TAM AND CAN BE QUANTIFIED WITH T2*-WEIGHTED MRI 45.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE AND EXTEND THE POWER OF MBATCH AND INCORPORATE A NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE NEW ALGORITHMS, TOOLS, AND INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATIONS INTO IT (OMICPIONEER-SC, MUTBATCH, CARDEC, AND CORNET). EVALUATING AND CORRECTING BATCH EFFECTS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS, SO WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH OTHER GDACS AND DATA GENERATING CENTERS TO DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF ARTIFACTS ON ANY ANALYSIS RESULTS THEY PRODUCE. THE SECOND AIM IS TO CONTRIBUTE AND ENHANCE ADDITIONAL COMPETENCIES. WE ARE PREPARED TO (I) PROVIDE INTEGRATED CLUSTER SOLUTIONS TO SEGREGATE CASES INTO BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT GROUPS; (II) PROVIDE TOOLS AND EXPERTISE FOR HIGH-LEVEL VISUALIZATION OF OMIC DATA (INCLUDING SINGLE-CELL DATA); AND (III) ANALYZE RPPA PROTEOMIC DATA FROM THE SUBSET OF PROJECTS THAT GENERATE SUCH DATA. OUR FINAL AIM IS TO COMMUNICATE RESULTS AND DISTRIBUTE CORRECTED DATA BACK TO OTHER NETWORK MEMBERS, PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS, AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.  WE BRING A NUMBER OF ASSETS TO THE TABLE, INCLUDING MULTIDISCIPLINARY EXPERTISE IN BIOINFORMATICS, BIOSTATISTICS, SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, CANCER BIOLOGY AND CANCER MEDICINE; PIS WITH A COMBINED 40+ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN MOLECULAR PROFILING OF CANCERS; EXPERTISE GAINED IN 10 YEARS OF DOING THE BATCH EFFECTS SURVEILLANCE FOR TCGA AND OTHER CCG PROJECTS; A HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TEAM WITH A TRACK RECORD OF PRODUCING HIGH-END BIOINFORMATICS TOOLS; EXTENSIVE COMPUTING RESOURCES, INCLUDING ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ACADEMIC CLUSTERS IN THE WORLD; AND CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH FIRST-CLASS BASIC, TRANSLATIONAL, AND CLINICAL RESEARCHERS ACROSS MD ANDERSON, ONE OF THE FOREMOST CANCER CENTERS IN THE U.S. THE BOTTOM-LINE MISSION OF THE GDAC WILL BE TO AID THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY\u2019S EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND CANCER AND TO PREVENT, DETECT, DIAGNOSE, AND TREAT IT MORE EFFECTIVELY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "07c08a07-af34-2853-20eb-9d2594ed7b35-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U24CA264006_7529"}, {"internal_id": 158529167, "Award ID": "U24CA258511", "Award Amount": 769671.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-04-25", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "EXTENSIBLE OPEN SOURCE ZERO-FOOTPRINT WEB VIEWER FOR CANCER IMAGING RESEARCH - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THE OPEN HEALTH IMAGING FOUNDATION (OHIF) VIEWER AND ITS UNDERLYING LIBRARIES SUCH AS CORNERSTONE HAVE BECOME THE STANDARD FRAMEWORK FOR WEB-BASED IMAGING INFORMATICS TECHNOLOGIES IN CANCER RESEARCH AND BEYOND, SUPPORTING HUNDREDS OF OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS WITH THOUSANDS OF USERS. THROUGH OHIF, DEVELOPERS CAN: 1) ADD NEW INNOVATIVE TOOLS AS EXTENSIONS TO THE OHIF VIEWER; 2) USE SPECIFIC OHIF MODULES OR LIBRARIES TO BUILD THEIR OWN CUSTOM TOOLS; AND 3) WEB-ENABLE EXISTING DESKTOP INFORMATICS PLATFORMS. TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION FROM DESKTOP TO WEB-BASED TOOLS, RESEARCHERS NEED WELL-SUPPORTED FRAMEWORKS TO BUILD UPON. CURRENTLY, MANY CANCER RESEARCH IMAGE VIEWERS REQUIRE SOFTWARE TO BE INSTALLED ON EACH USER'S LOCAL WORKSTATION, A DRAWBACK WHICH LIMITS ACCESSIBILITY AND EASE OF COLLABORATION. MOST WEB-VIEWERS AVAILABLE TODAY ARE EITHER PROPRIETARY, CLOSED SYSTEMS, OR OPEN-SOURCE RESEARCH APPLICATIONS THAT USE LEGACY TECHNOLOGIES. FOR CANCER IMAGING RESEARCH THAT REQUIRES MULTI-SITE COLLABORATION, THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR A FRAMEWORK THAT CAN ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO REVIEW IMAGES AND COLLABORATE WITH COLLEAGUES REMOTELY. OHIF\u2019S ZERO-FOOTPRINT WEB- VIEWER TOOLS PROVIDE ENORMOUS USABILITY BENEFITS FOR END USERS, WHO GAIN INSTANT ACCESS TO VIEW DATA ACROSS COMPUTERS WITHOUT ANY SOFTWARE TO INSTALL OR UPDATE.  UNDER A PRIOR NCI ITCR U24 GRANT, WE DEVELOPED THE OHIF FRAMEWORK, WHICH PROVIDES A PROFESSIONAL- GRADE, FREE, OPEN-SOURCE WEB-BASED IMAGING ENVIRONMENT FOR CANCER RESEARCH WITH IMAGE REVIEW, ANNOTATION FUNCTIONALITY, AND A USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE. THE OHIF VIEWER RELIES ON STANDARDS, WHICH HAS ENABLED EASY INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SYSTEMS, AND IT CAN BE EXTENDED TO PROVIDE CUSTOM FUNCTIONALITY WITHOUT MODIFYING THE CORE APPLICATION. ADDITIONALLY, ITS COMPONENTS CAN BE RE-USED TO RAPIDLY DEVELOP NEW APPLICATIONS AND HELP ENABLE THE TRANSITION TO CLOUD COMPUTING FOR CANCER RESEARCH TOOLS.  THE CORE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ENHANCE AND SUSTAIN THE OHIF PLATFORM AND BROADEN THE USER AND CONTRIBUTOR BASE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. THE CURRENT PROJECT HAS THREE AIMS: 1) EXTEND THE WEB-VIEWER\u2019S CANCER IMAGING VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES; 2) REDUCE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION BY CREATING READY-TO-USE INSTALLERS FOR ON-PREMISES AND CLOUD-HOSTED DEPLOYMENT; AND 3) EXPAND OUR SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE CANCER RESEARCH COMMUNITY. FOR COMMUNITY SUPPORT, WE WILL ENHANCE OUR OUTREACH, ENGAGEMENT, AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES TO FOSTER COLLABORATION WITH DEVELOPERS AND END USERS. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE CLINICAL TRANSLATION AND SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE WITH REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, WE WILL IMPLEMENT A QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (QMS) FOR CORE OHIF FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT AND REGULARLY RELEASE DESIGN DOCUMENTATION TO THE COMMUNITY.  ENHANCING THE PLATFORM'S FUNCTIONALITY, EASING INSTALLATION, AND ENRICHING SUPPORT WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO BETTER COLLABORATE TO EVALUATE THE NATURE OF CANCER DISEASE PROGRESSION AND RESPONSE TO TREATMENT.

THE INTEGRATIVE IMAGING INFORMATICS FOR CANCER RESEARCH (I3CR) CENTER HAS PLAYED A LEAD ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING CANCER IMAGING INFORMATICS TECHNOLOGY, WITH A FOCUS ON EXPANDING THE WIDELY USED OPEN SOURCE XNAT INFORMATICS PLATFORM TO BETTER SUPPORT COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOWS IN CANCER IMAGING. I3CR HAS ALSO DEVELOPED KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO BETTER TRACK DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS, INCLUDING TOOLS FOR ORCHESTRATING AND TRACKING CONTAINER-BASED COMPUTING PIPELINES. AS RESULT OF THIS WORK, XNAT HAS EMERGED AS THE MOST WIDELY USED IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM IN CANCER RESEARCH. IT IS DEPLOYED IN OVER 200 ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY AND HAS BEEN ADOPTED ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF RESEARCH CONTEXTS, INCLUDING PRECLINICAL IMAGING, MULTI-SITE CLINICAL TRIALS, AND CLINICAL TRANSLATION. AS THE I3CR INFORMATICS PLATFORM HAS MATURED AND BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED, THE CENTER IS NOW EVOLVING TO THE NEXT PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT TO MORE BROADLY SUSTAIN THE PLATFORM.

THERE IS CURRENTLY A GAP IN REPRESENTATION OF SOMATIC VARIANTS FOR CHILDHOOD TUMORS IN PUBLIC CANCER DATABASES AND KNOWLEDGEBASES. NEW APPROACHES FOR EVIDENCE CURATION ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY IMPORTANT MUTATIONS IN CHILDHOOD CANCERS FOR BOTH DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY RESPONSE. TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS, OUR APPLICATION BUILDS ON TWO PROMINENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD LED BY OUR TEAM. FIRST, AS THE CLINGEN SOMATIC CLINICAL DOMAIN WORKING GROUP (CDWG) WE DEVELOPED THE MINIMAL VARIANT LEVEL DATA (MVLD) STANDARD TO PROMOTE SHARING AND USE OF GENE VARIANTS IN PRECISION ONCOLOGY. SECOND, WE DEVELOPED THE CLINICAL INTERPRETATION OF VARIANTS IN CANCER (CIVIC) EXPERT CROWDSOURCED PLATFORM FOR SOMATIC CURATION AND CLINICAL INTERPRETATION. OUR GOALS ARE TO: (1) SYSTEMATICALLY CATALOG THE CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF COMMON, RARE, AND NOVEL VARIANTS IDENTIFIED THROUGH GENE-SPECIFIC AND GENOME-SCALE TESTING IN CHILDHOOD CANCERS; (2) PARTNER WITH CLINGEN, CLINVAR, GUIDELINE-SETTING PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER RELEVANT GLOBAL EFFORTS TO TRANSLATE AND PRESENT THE KNOWLEDGE DERIVED FROM GENOME RESEARCHERS AND CLINICAL LABORATORIES; AND (3) DEVELOP INFORMATICS SUPPORT FOR VARIANT ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL ACTIONABILITY, INFORMATION DISPLAY, INTERFACING WITH RELEVANT DATABASES, AND DISSEMINATION. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS WE DEVELOPED A COLLABORATION OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS THROUGH THE CLINGEN SOMATIC CDWG AMONG RESEARCHERS AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, AND CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES THAT INCLUDES CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR GENETICISTS, GENETIC COUNSELORS, BIOINFORMATICIANS, AND GENOMIC DATABASE EXPERTS TO ADVANCE THE USE OF GENOMIC DATA IN CHILDHOOD CANCERS. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL ESTABLISH PILOT VARIANT CURATION EXPERT PANELS (VCEPS) TO ASSESS CLINICAL RELEVANCE AND ACTIONABILITY OF SOMATIC VARIANTS IN PEDIATRIC CANCERS.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THE GOAL OF THE EDRN SOUTHWEST CLINICAL VALIDATION CENTER FOR HEAD AND NECK CANCER IS TO IMPROVE OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER SCREENING THROUGH THE RIGOROUS VALIDATION OF SALIVARY BIOMARKERS. THE SCIENTIFIC APPROACH OF OUR CENTER IS BASED ON SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. FIRST, THAT HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRAL (HPV) INFECTION AND PERSISTENCE INDUCES CARCINOGENESIS IN THE OROPHARYNX OVER DECADES, GENERATING WELL-DOCUMENTED CIRCULATING AND SALIVARY VIRAL NUCLEIC ACID AND SEROLOGIC BIOMARKERS. THESE BIOMARKERS HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED IN RIGOROUS, PROSPECTIVE STUDIES WITH CENTRALIZED CLIA/CAP BIOMARKER VALIDATION. SECOND, THE LOW INCIDENCE REQUIRES THAT EFFECTIVE SCREENING PARADIGMS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCERS (OPC) USE NOVEL SYSTEMS FOR LARGE-SCALE PROSPECTIVE STUDIES USING SELF-COLLECTION SAMPLING, DIGITAL ENROLLMENT, AND DISTRIBUTIVE SYSTEMS TO ENABLE ENROLLMENT IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THIRD, THAT THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF POSITIVE BIOMARKERS BE RIGOROUSLY ADDRESSED. OUR PROPOSAL BUILDS ON OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCES WITH CANCER BIOMARKER DEVELOPMENT, VERIFICATION, VALIDATION, INNOVATIVE CLINICAL STUDY MANAGEMENT, AND EXPERTISE IN HPV OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER SCREENING. OUR PREVIOUS RESULTS ON HPV SEROLOGIC BIOMARKERS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED IN BLINDED PHASE 2 MULTICENTER VALIDATION STUDIES. OUR RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THAT MULTIPLEXED PANELS OF IGG ANTIBODIES FOR HPV16 ARE REQUIRED FOR ADEQUATE PREDICTIVE VALUE. OUR MESO SCALE DIAGNOSTICS, LLC. (MSD\u00ae) TEAM HAS FIELDED OVER 3,000 INSTRUMENTS WORLDWIDE, AND OVER 700 COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE BIOMARKER ASSAY KITS. THEIR EXPERTISE AT SEROLOGIC ASSAY DEVELOPMENT LED TO ONE OF THEIR V-PLEX\u00ae SEROLOGY PANELS BEING SELECTED BY OPERATION WARP SPEED AS THE BASIS OF ITS STANDARD BINDING ASSAYS FOR IMMUNOGENICITY ASSESSMENTS IN ALL FUNDED PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS OF COVID VACCINES. WE WILL USE THE MSD MULTI-ARRAY\u00ae PLATFORM TO MIGRATE THE HPV SEROLOGIC MARKERS FOR TARGET CLINICAL APPLICATIONS IN SALIVA. THIS REPRESENTS AN ONGOING COLLABORATION WITH EXPERTS IN LARGE-SCALE SELF-COLLECTION SALIVARY BIOMARKER SCREENING AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, EXPERTS ON HEAD AND NECK CANCER SCREENING AT BAYLOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, AND AT STILL UNIVERSITY (ATSU) SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY AND ORAL HEALTH. WE WILL GENERATE HIGH-QUALITY WELL-CHARACTERIZED SAMPLES TO VALIDATE CIRCULATING AND SALIVARY BIOMARKERS TO ENHANCE OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER SCREENING. ADHERING TO THE PRINCIPLES OF PROBE DESIGN, WE WILL PERFORM PHASE 2 VALIDATION OF HPV SEROLOGY AND NUCLEIC ACID TESTING WITH CANCER PATIENT AND CONTROL SERA AND SALIVA, FOLLOWED BY DEVELOPING AND TESTING THE METHODOLOGY NEEDED TO CONDUCT A PROSPECTIVE PHASE 4 SALIVARY SCREENING STUDY.

RESTRICTED AVAILABILITY OF ENDOSCOPY (EGD), ALONG WITH RARITY AND DELAYS IN HISTOLOGY, IMPAIRS DETECTION OF ESCC IN LMICS, ADVERSELY IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO TREAT THIS DISEASE EFFECTIVELY. THUS, IN LMICS, INEXPENSIVE, SAFE, LOCALLY PERFORMABLE STRATEGIES FOR DETECTING ESCC ARE NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK PATIENTS AND REFER THEM QUICKLY TO SUITABLE DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS. THEREFORE, A DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH FEATURING A RETRIEVABLE SWALLOWED SPONGE-ON-A-STRING TO GATHER ESOPHAGEAL SPECIMENS FOR MOLECULAR TESTING, COMBINED WITH A POINT-OF-CARE (POC) MAGNETOFLUIDIC CHIP FOR SAMPLE PROCESSING AND DNA METHYLATION DETECTION, IS PROPOSED. THE STRING-SPONGE IS LESS EXPENSIVE, MORE NONINVASIVE, MORE CONVENIENT, AND MORE RAPID THAN EGD WITH BIOPSY. THE MAGNETOFLUIDIC CHIP STREAMLINES DNA PURIFICATION, DNA BISULPHITE TREATMENT, AND PCR DETECTION OF METHYLATION MARKERS INTO A SINGLE POC APPARATUS. THIS APPROACH DOES NOT NECESSITATE EGD, CAN BE PERFORMED IN REMOTE AREAS WITH PORTABLE ENERGY SUPPLIES AND DOES NOT REQUIRE EXTENSIVE MEDICAL TRAINING, AND IS THEREBY AMENABLE TO IMPLEMENTATION IN LMICS.

WHILE SMOKING STATUS AND AGING ARE WELL DOCUMENTED KEY LUNG CANCER RISK FACTORS, ALONG WITH SEVERAL ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS INCLUDING CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL CARCINOGENIC EXPOSURES, THERE IS A GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER IMPORTANT CAUSES OF THE DISEASE INCLUDING BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT MAY MODIFY THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURES OR BE INDEPENDENT RISK FACTORS. BECAUSE DNA REPAIR ABILITY IS KEY IN AVOIDING MUTATIONS AND PREVENTING CANCER, AND LIKELY REFLECTS MULTIPLE INHERITED AND OTHER INFLUENCES, WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED A PANEL OF THREE FUNCTIONAL DNA REPAIR BLOOD TESTS, WHICH DIRECTLY MEASURE AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S EFFECTIVENESS AT REPAIRING OXIDATIVE DNA DAMAGE BY THE ENZYMES OGG1, MPG AND APE1. USING THESE TESTS IN A CASE- CONTROL STUDY, WE FOUND THAT A LOW DNA REPAIR SCORE, CALCULATED FROM THE THREE TESTS, WAS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH LUNG CANCER IN ADDITION TO AND INDEPENDENT OF SMOKING. THIS WAS RECENTLY REPLICATED IN A SECOND CASE-CONTROL STUDY, SUGGESTING THAT ADDING THE DNA REPAIR SCORE TO CURRENT LUNG CANCER RISK MODELS IS LIKELY TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE RISK PREDICTION. THE DATA SO FAR IS CONSISTENT WITH A CAUSATIVE ROLE IN LUNG CANCER, BUT BECAUSE THE FINDINGS ARE BASED ON CASE-CONTROL STUDIES, WHERE DISEASE BIAS CANNOT BE RULED OUT, PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A ROLE OF A LOW DNA REPAIR SCORE IN LUNG CANCER ETIOLOGY REQUIRES DEMONSTRATING ITS ABILITY TO PREDICT LUNG CANCER IN PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDIES.  OUR GOAL IS TO EXAMINE THE PREDICTIVE ABILITY OF THE DNA REPAIR SCORE FOR LUNG CANCER IN A NESTED CASE- CONTROL STUDY WITHIN A PROSPECTIVE COHORT, NAMELY THE PLCO SCREENING TRIAL.

THE OVERARCHING THEME OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH FOCUSES ON SENSITIVITY, FEASIBILITY, AND PATIENT ACCEPTABILITY.

IF POSITIVE, THIS WOULD PROMPT APPLICATION OF A FEASIBLE, NON-CONTRAST, AND ROBUST MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) PROTOCOL THAT AUGMENTS MRI AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE CHLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY (MRCP) OF THE PANCREAS WITH QUANTITATIVELY RIGOROUS MR FINGERPRINTING (MRF). MRF CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY QUANTIFY PARAMETERS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FIBROSIS AND INFLAMMATION (T1, T2, AND T1P).

THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO TRANSLATE THIS PROSTATE CANCER PRS INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE BY ADDRESSING FOUR IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: 1) CAN THE PRS BE INTEGRATED WITH OTHER TOOLS INCLUDING MRI AND RARE GENETIC VARIANTS IN DNA DAMAGE REPAIR (DDR) PATHWAYS AS PART OF AN EARLY DETECTION STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY CLINICALLY-RELEVANT, POTENTIALLY LETHAL PROSTATE CANCER? 2) AT WHAT POINT IN A MAN'S LIFE SHOULD AN EARLY DETECTION PROGRAM BEGIN IF HE IS AT INCREASED GENETIC RISK? 3) WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL INTERVAL OF IMAGING TO DETECT CLINICALLY RELEVANT CANCER IN MEN AT HIGH GENETIC RISK?  THIS COLLABORATIVE U01 PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES IN THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1 - WE WILL PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF A PROSTATE CANCER PRS INTEGRATED WITH MRI TO IDENTIFY HIGHER-GRADE, POTENTIALLY LETHAL PROSTATE CANCER. WE WILL RECRUIT 1500 MEN (600 BLACK, 900 WHITE) FROM THE MGB BIOBANK, THE WALTER REED BIOBANK, AND THE PRIMARY CARE NETWORK AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY AND BRIGHAM & WOMEN'S HOSPITAL. ALL MEN WILL BE STRATIFIED INTO LOW, AVERAGE, AND HIGH RISK ON THE BASIS GENOTYPING. PSA, MRI, AND DDR VARIANTS WILL BE OBTAINED FOLLOWED BY BIOPSY FOR ELEVATED PSA OR ABNORMAL MRI. WE EXPECT TO FIND THE PRS IDENTIFIES A POPULATION AT RISK FOR PROSTATE CANCER WHILE THE DDR VARIANTS AND MRI IDENTIFIES A SUBSET WITH CLINICALLY RELEVANT DISEASE. IN AIM 2, WE WILL EVALUATE AT WHAT POINT IN A MAN'S LIFE AN MRI IS CLINICALLY USEFUL. OUR POPULATION WILL BE IMAGED ACROSS 5 YEAR AGE GROUPS FROM 40-69 YEARS. IN ADDITION, MEN AT THE HIGH GENETIC RISK WITHOUT CANCER WILL UNDERGO SERIAL MRI IMAGING AT THE NCI AT 2 YEAR INTERVALS. IN AIM 3 WE WILL DETERMINE IF DEEP LEARNING METHODS APPLIED TO MPMRI AND INFORMED BY GENETIC RISK CAN MORE ACCURATELY PREDICT SIGNIFICANT CANCERS.  THIS WILL BE THE FIRST IN FIELD PROSPECTIVE TRIAL TO INTEGRATE GERMLINE GENETICS WITH MRI TO IDENTIFY MEN AT RISK OF CLINICALLY-RELEVANT PROSTATE CANCER. THE RESULTS WILL HAVE SHORT-TERM IMPACT BY ESTABLISHING AN OPTIMAL EARLY DETECTION ALGORITHM AND SHOW THE UTILITY OF INCORPORATING INFORMATION ON THE GERMLINE INTO AN EARLY DETECTION STRATEGY. IT WILL ESTABLISH THE ROLE OF MRI IN DETECTING CLINICALLY RELEVANT CANCERS AMONG THOSE WITH HIGH GENETIC RISK. THE LONGER-TERM GOAL WILL BE TO USE THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED TO DESIGN TRIALS OF THE AT-RISK POPULATIONS WITH LONGER FOLLOW-UP TO PROVE THAT GENETIC TESTING CAN IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO PREVENT PROSTATE CANCER MORTALITY THROUGH TARGETED SCREENING AND PROPHYLAXIS. IMPORTANTLY, MEN AT LOW RISK FOR CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DISEASE COULD BE SPARED SCREENING, PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE DIRECTLY TRANSLATED INTO PATIENT POPULATIONS.

IN THE US, 11% OF MEN ARE DIAGNOSED WITH PCA OVER THEIR LIFETIME, WITH INCIDENCE GENERALLY RISING WITH  AGE [2]. THE PROSTATE IMAGING REPORTING AND DATA SYSTEM (PI-RADS) HAS BECOME A STANDARD TOOL FOR DIAGNOSING PCA USING  MULTI-PARAMETRIC MR IMAGES (MP-MRI). PI-RADS AIMS TO STANDARDIZE THE WAY TO CLASSIFY THE CANCER GRADES. HOWEVER, PI-RADS DOES NOT USE CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC PATIENT INFORMATION, AND MR IMAGES ARE ASSESSED QUALITATIVELY OR AT MOST  SEMI-QUANTITATIVELY CAUSING UNDER-DETECTION OF DANGEROUS CANCER AND OVER-DETECTION OF INSIGNIFICANT CANCER.  THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) ALGORITHMS TO IMPROVE THE DETECTION ACCURACY BY REDUCING  ASSESSMENT VARIATIONS AND PROVIDING TRUSTABLE PREDICTIONS. OUR ALGORITHMS WILL USE DIVERSE POPULATION DATA AND EVENTUALLY A  FAR BETTER EVALUATION SYSTEM. THIS NEW SYSTEM WILL INPUT MP-MRI, CLINICAL (DIGITAL RECTAL EXAM, PCA FAMILY HISTORY),  DEMOGRAPHIC (AGE, RACE), AND LABORATORY (SERUM PSA) DATA TO PROVIDE RISK SCORES FOR INTRAPROSTATIC LESIONS, AND  IMPROVE PATIENT MANAGEMENT FOR DIVERSE POPULATIONS. THE SMART SYSTEM WE WILL DEVELOP IS CALLED HYBRID INTELLIGENCE AND TRUSTABLE (HIT)-PIRADS AND SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE THREE-FOLD:  FIRST, WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW PRE-PROCESSING FRAMEWORK FOR ENHANCING MP-MRI DATA AND MINIMIZING DATA BIASES. MRI  QUALITY VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY, WHICH MAKES STANDARDIZATION VERY DIFFICULT. TO NORMALIZE MRI, WE WILL CORRECT ARTIFACTS, REMOVE  INHOMOGENEITY AND NOISE AS THE PRE-PROCESSING STEP. NEXT, DATASET BIAS, SUCH AS OVER/UNDER-REPRESENTATION OF RACE WILL BE  DEALT WITH AS BIASES CAUSE SKEWED AND INACCURATE OUTCOMES. WE WILL EXAMINE IMBALANCES AND QUANTIFY UNCERTAINTIES IN DATA  REPRESENTATION TO DEVELOP A VISUAL BIAS-ESTIMATION TOOL (VIBET) TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL BIASES IN THE DATA. SECOND, WE WILL  DEVELOP JOINT SEGMENTATION, DETECTION, AND CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS FOR PCA USING MP-MRI. QUANTIFICATION OF PROSTATE AND  PCA IS ESSENTIAL FOR LESION IDENTIFICATION, RISK STRATIFICATION, BIOPSY GUIDANCE, AND LESION TARGETING FOR SURGERY/FOCAL THERAPIES.  WE WILL USE OUR INNOVATIVE CAPSULE-BASED NEURAL NETWORKS ALGORITHMS AND EXTEND ITS STRENGTH TO ANALYZE MP-MRI AND NONIMAGING DATA. THIS STEP WILL IMPROVE GENERALIZATION OF OUR ALGORITHMS TO ALL RISK GROUPS, RACES, AND AGES. THERE WILL BE ALSO  AN EXPLANATION MODULE IN THE HIT-PIRADAS: WE WILL EMBED BOTH RADIOGRAPHICAL INTERPRETATIONS AND VISUAL EXPLANATIONS  INTO THE BASELINE HIT-PIRADS. THIRD, WE WILL EVALUATE AND VALIDATE THE EFFICACY OF THE HIT-PIRADS BOTH RETROSPECTIVELY  AND PROSPECTIVELY. WE WILL PROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HIT-PIRADS IN OVER 7000 PATIENTS\u2019 DATA (3846 RETROSPECTIVE, 3200  PROSPECTIVE). WE WILL RIGOROUSLY EVALUATE SOURCES OF VARIATIONS AND STANDARDIZE HIT-PIRADS FOR ADOPTION IN THE CLINICS.  THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND AND EASY-TO-USE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR PCA DETECTION AND  PATIENT MANAGEMENT (HIT-PIRADS) TO PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE, UNBIASED, REPRODUCIBLE RESULTS TO REDUCE PCA RELATED  MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY.

ALTHOUGH NO PSA CONCENTRATION CONFERS ZERO RISK OF FINDING CANCER AT PROSTATE BIOPSY, A SINGLE PSA MEASUREMENT AT MIDLIFE IS A REMARKABLY STRONG PREDICTOR OF THE RISK OF DEVELOPING LETHAL PROSTATE CANCER DECADES LATER. PSA IS A PROTEOLYTIC ENZYME THAT IS NON-CATALYTIC IN BLOOD, AND IT OCCURS IN MULTIPLE FORMS. A STATISTICAL MODEL BASED ON FOUR KALLIKREIN (4K) MARKERS (FREE, TOTAL, AND INTACT PSA, PLUS HUMAN KALLIKREIN-RELATED PEPTIDASE-2 [HK2]) IMPROVES SPECIFICITY IN DETECTING HIGH-GRADE PROSTATE CANCER AMONG MEN WITH ELEVATED PSA (REDUCING UNNECESSARY BIOPSIES) AND IS ALSO A STRONG PREDICTOR OF THE RISK OF LETHAL PROSTATE CANCER DECADES LATER. WHILE INTRA-INDIVIDUAL FLUCTUATIONS IN PSA LEVELS ARE COMMON, AN EXCESSIVE DEGREE OF VARIABILITY IS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC, AS TEMPORARY \u201cFALSE POSITIVE\u201d ELEVATIONS REDUCE THE SPECIFICITY OF PSA AS A CANCER MARKER, ATTENUATE THE DIAGNOSTIC VALUE OF PSA KINETICS, AND LEAD TO THE USE OF UNNECESSARY ANTIBIOTICS. LESS STUDIED BUT SIMILARLY ABUNDANT IN PROSTATIC FLUID AS PSA, THE CONCENTRATION OF MICROSEMINOPROTEIN-SS (MSP, MSMB) IN BLOOD IS INVERSELY ASSOCIATED WITH PROSTATE CANCER RISK, AND A SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM (SNP, RS10993994) IN THE PROMOTER REGION OF THE MSMB GENE IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH PROSTATE CANCER RISK, BUT THE ROLE OF THESE MARKERS IN CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING IS UNCLEAR. SIMILARLY, A SNP IN THE SERPINA3 GENE IS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BLOOD LEVELS OF PSA, AND THE ENCODED PROTEIN, ALPHA-1-ANTICHYMOTRYPSIN (ACT), IS THE PREDOMINANT STABLE COMPLEXING LIGAND TO PSA IN THE BLOOD. HOWEVER, THE CLINICAL VALUE OF THESE MAKERS IS UNDETERMINED, AND IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER ACT LEVELS IN BLOOD INFLUENCE THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF A BASELINE PSA VALUE OR AFFECT INTRA-INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN PSA. ADDITIONALLY, THE INTRA-INDIVIDUAL VARIATION OF THE 4K-PANEL IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN BUT COULD BE DETERMINED USING HIGH-QUALITY SERIAL SAMPLES. AS THE ROLE OF THESE DIFFERENT MOLECULAR MARKERS IN COMBINED RISK-PREDICTION MODELS OF AGGRESSIVE PROSTATE CANCER IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD, WE PLAN TO DELINEATE THE INFLUENCE OF INTRA-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY IN SERIAL SCREENING SAMPLES ON CLINICAL DECISION- MAKING FOR RISK STRATIFICATION AND BIOPSY BY A SINGLE PSA VALUE AND ADDITIONAL MARKERS. USING BLOOD SAMPLES FROM THE PLCO, G\u00d6TEBORG-1 & -2 TRIALS, AND MULTIETHNIC COHORT (MEC), WE PLAN TO: 1) QUANTIFY THE PATTERNS OF VARIATION IN THE 4K MARKERS + MSP IN SERIAL MEASUREMENTS; 2) DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A STATISTICAL MODEL BASED ON 4K MARKERS + MSP AND SUBSEQUENT RISK OF LETHAL PROSTATE CANCER, THEN INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATE THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF THE MARKERS IN DECISION-MAKING AND RISK STRATIFICATION BEFORE TREATMENT DECISIONS IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENTS (PROTECT); AND 3) COMPARE HEAD-TO-HEAD THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF PRE-BIOPSY BIOMARKERS VERSUS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING ON CANCER DETECTION RATES.

UNFORTUNATELY, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATE AN ALARMING INCREASE IN INCI- DENCE IN POPULATIONS BELOW THE AGE OF 50, WHO ARE NOT ROUTINELY SCREENED. FURTHERMORE, CRC DETECTION IS DIFFICULT IN HIGH-RISK GROUPS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION (E.G. FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS), DISEASE TRAITS (E.G. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE), OR FROM CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS (E.G. BLACK-AMERICANS). THUS, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF CRC AND THE PREVENTION OF THE TRANSITION FROM ADENOMA TO CRC. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM WILL DEVELOP GENETICALLY ENGINEERED BACTERIA USING SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY EARLY CRC DEVELOPMENT, MONITOR AND REPORT CHANGES IN THE ADENOMA AND CRC MICROENVIRONMENT, AND PREVENT CANCER PROGRESSION. TO ACHIEVE THE ABOVE OBJECTIVES, ENGINEERED BACTERIA HAVE TO ENGRAFT AND COLONIZE THE HOSTILE LUMINAL ENVIRONMENT, SENSE AND DISTINGUISH AN ABNORMAL ENVIRONMENTAL SIGNAL, COMPUTE THIS SIGNAL, AND EXPRESS A REPORTER OR A THERAPEUTIC AGENT. HOWEVER, APPROPRIATE VECTORS WITH THESE FEATURES REMAIN LACKING, CONSTRAINING SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY APPLICA- TIONS FOR CANCER RESEARCH. IMPORTANTLY, CRC IS HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH E.

FOR EXAMPLE, WHOLE-CELL BIOSENSORS SUCH AS BACTERIA HAVE BEEN GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TO PERFORM COMPLEX FUNCTIONS SUCH AS SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION TO DETECT CLINICALLY RELEVANT BIOMARKERS IN HUMAN URINE AND SERUM. IN MAMMALIAN CELLS, SENSE-AND-RESPOND COMPONENTS THAT EMPLOY BOOLEAN LOGIC HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR MULTIPLEXED CONTROL OF ENGINEERED T CELL THERAPIES, THEREBY INCREASING THE SPECIFICITY OF TUMOR SENSING AND REDUCING SYSTEMIC TOXICITY. THESE ADVANCES HIGHLIGHT THE PROMISE OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY WHEN APPLIED TO CANCER, YET THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE STRATEGIES RELY ON GENETIC CIRCUITS AND MAKE USE OF NON-MAMMALIAN PROTEIN COMPONENTS. SUCH CIRCUITS ARE COMPLEX AND RAISE SAFETY AND IMMUNOGENICITY CONCERNS FOR REGULATORY APPROVAL, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF IN VIVO EARLY CANCER DETECTION WHERE REPEATED ADMINISTRATIONS OF BIOSENSORS ARE LIKELY NEEDED TO MONITOR FOR NASCENT DISEASE. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO DEVELOP A NEW CLASS OF DIAGNOSTICS CALLED AND-GATED SYNTHETIC BIOMARKERS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF CANCER METASTASIS. SYNTHETIC BIOMARKERS ARE AN EMERGING CLASS OF ACTIVATABLE BIOLOGICAL SENSORS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BE ADMINISTERED SYSTEMICALLY, QUERY SITES OF EARLY DISEASE, AND HARNESS TUMOR-DEPENDENT ACTIVATION MECHANISMS, SUCH AS DYSREGULATED PROTEASE ACTIVITY, TO DRIVE PRODUCTION OF A REPORTER. THESE REPORTERS CAN THEN BE DETECTED NONINVASIVELY FROM BLOOD, URINE, OR OTHER BODILY FLUID SAMPLES. PROTEASES PLAY KEY BIOLOGICAL ROLES ACROSS THE MAJOR HALLMARKS OF METASTASIS AND ARE PARTICULARLY POTENT MOLECULAR AMPLIFIERS BY CATALYZING THE IRREVERSIBLE HYDROLYSIS OF PEPTIDE BONDS, ALLOWING A SINGLE PROTEASE TO TURNOVER THOUSANDS OF SUBSTRATES.

THERE IS CLEARLY A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL BIOMARKERS THAT COMPLEMENT EXISTING SCREENING PROCEDURES TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS FOR SUBSEQUENT COLONOSCOPY AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGY THAT GIVES RISE TO TUMORS. UNTARGETED METABOLOMICS HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY COMMON APPROACH TO IDENTIFY SOURCES OF SUCH BIOMARKERS FROM FECAL SAMPLES; HOWEVER, THE GENERAL APPROACH RESEARCHERS USE TO ANALYZE THE DATA EXCLUDES THE 95% OF METABOLITES THAT CURRENTLY LACK AN ANNOTATION. ANIMAL MODELS OF CRC AND HUMAN POPULATION STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE GUT MICROBIOTA HAS AN UNDERAPPRECIATED ROLE IN THE DISEASE. THEREFORE, IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE CHARACTERIZE THE METABOLITES GENERATED BY THE GUT MICROBIOTA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP BIOMARKERS THAT IMPROVE THE DETECTION OF CRC AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING CRC.

THIS BEHAVIOR IS REPRESENTED BY A CHANGE-POINT MODEL IN CASES WHILE THE SAME BIOMARKER IN WOMEN WITHOUT OVARIAN CANCER (CONTROLS) WILL HAVE A FLAT PROFILE. ED BIOMARKERS WILL BE THE PROTEINS WHICH HAVE A CHANGE-POINT IN A SUBSTANTIAL FRACTION OF CASES WHILE REMAINING STABLE IN MOST (98%) CONTROLS. WE WILL IDENTIFY THE TOP 20 ED BIOMARKERS WHERE THE CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IS A COMBINATION OF FRACTION OF CASES, COMPLEMENTARITY TO PROTEINS ALREADY SELECTED, AND TIME OF RISE WITH EARLIER RISERS HAVING PRIORITY. AFTER IDENTIFICATION OF THE 20 ED BIOMARKERS, OLINK WILL DEVELOP A CUSTOM PANEL OF 20 ED MARKERS WITH ABSOLUTE QUANTIFICATION. THE CUSTOM PANEL WILL ASSAY THE SAME PLCO PLASMA SAMPLES AS USED IN DISCOVERY. THESE DATA WILL BE ANALYZED WITH A MULTIVARIATE LONGITUDINAL CHANGE-POINT MODEL TO FORM A MULTIPLE MARKER LONGITUDINAL ALGORITHM FOR ED. THIS CLASSIFIER WILL BE LOCKED DOWN. THE CLASSIFIER WILL BE VALIDATED BY ASSAYING THE CUSTOM PANEL OF 20 ED BIOMARKERS ON AN INDEPENDENT PLCO SERIAL PLASMA SAMPLE SET, FROM CASES (N=50) AND 10:1 MATCHED CONTROLS (N=500). FROM THESE DATA THE CLASSIFIER WILL BE ASSESSED FOR TWO DIMENSIONS OF SENSITIVITY FOR EARLY DETECTION: (I) THE NUMBER OF MONTHS PRIOR TO DETECTION IN PLCO, AND (II) PROPORTION OF CASES DETECTED, WHILE (III) MAINTAINING A HIGH SPECIFICITY GOAL OF 98% - OR A FALSE POSITIVE RATE OF 2%.

THOUGH MAMMOGRAPHY MAY DETECT BREAST CANCER EARLY, ITS APPLICATION IS OFTEN LIMITED BY OVERDIAGNOSIS AND INCREASED COST. TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS, RISK PREDICTION AND POPULATION STRATIFICATION ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY WOMEN LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM BREAST CANCER MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING. THUS, IDENTIFYING SENSITIVE YET ROBUST BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT RISK MARKERS FOR RISK PREDICTION AND POPULATION STRATIFICATION IS A PRESSING NEED TO ULTIMATELY REDUCE BREAST CANCER DISEASE BURDEN. AN INTACT DNA REPAIR IS ESSENTIAL IN BREAST TISSUE DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE REMODELING OF THE TISSUE THROUGHOUT A WOMAN'S LIFE. EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE PROVIDES STRONG SUPPORT FOR HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION REPAIR (HRR), A MAJOR DNA REPAIR PATHWAY RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRING DNA DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS, IN GUARDING AGAINST MAMMARY CELL TUMORIGENESIS. A CLASSIC EXAMPLE IS THAT MAJOR HIGH- AND MODERATE-PENETRANCE BREAST CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES (E.G., BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, PALB2, AND RAD51D) ARE KEY PLAYERS IN HRR. THEREFORE, SUBOPTIMAL HRR CAPACITY MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASED ACCUMULATION OF DNA DAMAGE AND AN ELEVATED RISK OF BREAST CANCER. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF TOOLS TO MEASURE HRR CAPACITY NON-INVASIVE, SUCH ASSUMPTION HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN THE NON-FAMILIAL OR UNSELECTED SETTING. RECENTLY, WE DEVELOPED A PHENOTYPIC ASSAY TO MEASURE HRR CAPACITY IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES (PBLS). OUR ASSAY CAN PROVIDE A READOUT OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE MULTIPLE STEPS OF HRR IN SURROGATE TISSUE, WHICH IS CRITICALLY NEEDED FOR POPULATION STUDIES. IN OUR PRELIMINARY BREAST CANCER STUDY, WE FOUND THAT HRR CAPACITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN CASES THAN IN CONTROLS (P<0.001), AND DECREASED HRR CAPACITY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER. OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO FULLY ASSESS THE ROLE OF HRR IN PBLS IN BREAST CANCER DEVELOPMENT BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE RICH RESOURCES FROM THE PROSTATE, LUNG, COLORECTAL, AND OVARIAN CANCER SCREENING TRIAL (PLCO) COHORT. WE WILL FIRST CARRY OUT A NESTED CASE-CONTROL STUDY TO VALIDATE HRR CAPACITY IN PBLS AS A BREAST CANCER RISK FACTOR OVERALL AND BY SUBTYPES. THEN, WE WILL EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF SUBOPTIMAL HRR IN PBLS ON BREAST TUMORIGENESIS BY EVALUATING SUBOPTIMAL HRR CAPACITY IN PBLS AS A PREDICTIVE BIOMARKER FOR THE MUTATIONAL SIGNATURE OF HRR IN BREAST TUMORS. AS SHOWN IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, HRR DEFICIENCY IN TUMORS HAS GENETIC DETERMINANTS. HOWEVER, WHETHER HRR IN PBLS IS CORRELATED WITH HRR PHENOTYPE IN BREAST TUMOR TISSUE IS UNKNOWN. LASTLY, TO DISSECT THE GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF HRR IN PBLS, WE WILL DEVELOP A POLYGENETIC RISK SCORE (PRS) FOR HRR CAPACITY IN PBLS AND FURTHER ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION OF THE PRS WITH BREAST CANCER

OUR TEAM HAS MADE NOVEL FINDINGS THAT HUMAN ORAL BACTERIAL MICROBIOME IS RELATED TO RISK OF PANCREAS CANCER DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE FOCUS ON ORAL FUNGI (THE MYCOBIOME), A \u201cKEYSTONE\u201d COMPONENT OF THE ORAL MICROBIOME WITH THE HIGHEST BIOMASS. CLINICAL CANDIDIASIS AND CARRIAGE OF A RARE CANDIDIASIS-RELATED GENETIC DISORDER INCREASE RISK FOR PANCREAS CANCER.

WE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT FUNGI EXPERIMENTALLY PROMOTE PANCREAS CANCER AND TUMORAL IMMUNE RESPONSE IN ANIMALS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE DATA STRONGLY SUPPORT OUR HYPOTHESIS. OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC ORAL FUNGAL MICROBIOTA IN THE GENERAL POPULATION THAT MAY BE MANAGED TO PREVENT PANCREATIC CANCER. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1) TO TEST WHETHER ORAL FUNGAL MICROBIOME IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSEQUENT RISK OF PANCREATIC CANCER IN A NESTED CASE-CONTROL STUDY AND 2) TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT METABOLICALLY ACTIVE FUNGI IN THE PANCREAS INFLUENCE TUMOR IMMUNITY.

INVESTIGATE PLASMA AND CYST FLUID LEVELS AND TRAJECTORIES OF PROTEOMIC BIOMARKERS AND METABOLOMICS SIGNATURES FOR PREDICTION OF IPMN MALIGNANT PROGRESSION IN A PROSPECTIVE SURVEILLANCE COHORT. 1A: A GLOBAL PROTEOMICS AND METABOLOMICS STUDY OF PANCREATIC CYST FLUID IN 160 IPMN SURGICAL PATIENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY PROTEINS AND METABOLITES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH-GRADE AND INVASIVE IPMN. 1B: TOP PROTEINS IDENTIFIED FROM 1A AND 6 PROTEINS (THBS2, PGE2, LRG1, TIMP1, C1RL, & PTPRJ) DISCOVERED IN OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES WILL BE MEASURED IN SERIAL PLASMA (N=3) AND CYST FLUID (N=~2.5) SAMPLES FROM 500 IPMN PATIENTS UNDER SURVEILLANCE. 1C: TOP METABOLITES IDENTIFIED FROM 1A AND 4 PLASMA METABOLITES CORRELATED WITH IPMN DYSPLASIA GRADE IN OUR R21 STUDY WILL BE QUANTIFIED IN THE 1B POPULATION. THE LEVELS AND TRAJECTORIES OF PROTEINS AND METABOLITES MEASURED IN 1B AND 1C WILL BE EVALUATED IN RELATION TO IPMN MALIGNANT PROGRESSION. 1D: A RISK PREDICTION MODEL FOR IPMN MALIGNANT PROGRESSION WILL BE BUILT FROM PROTEINS AND METABOLITES IDENTIFIED AND VALIDATED IN 1B AND 1C, CA 19-9, AND CLINICAL/IMAGING FEATURES. 2. EVALUATE LEVELS AND TRAJECTORIES OF PLASMA PROTEOMIC BIOMARKERS AND METABOLOMICS SIGNATURES FOR DETECTION OF EARLY- STAGE PDAC IN A PROBE-COMPLIANT CASE-CONTROL STUDY NESTED IN THE PLCO COHORT. 2A: PROTEINS IDENTIFIED IN 1A AND 6 BIOMARKERS LISTED IN 1B WILL BE MEASURED IN SERIAL PREDIAGNOSTIC PLASMA SAMPLES (N=UP TO 3) FROM 242 PDAC CASES (INCL. 80 EARLY-STAGE CASES) AND 242 MATCHED CONTROLS. 2B: IN THE 2A POPULATION, TOP METABOLITES IDENTIFIED FROM 1A, 4 METABOLITES DESCRIBED IN 1C, AND 5 METABOLITES PREDICTING EARLY-STAGE PDAC IN OUR PILOT STUDIES WILL BE DETERMINED. 2C: A RISK PREDICTION MODEL FOR EARLY-STAGE PDAC WILL BE DEVELOPED FROM PROTEINS AND METABOLITES IDENTIFIED IN 2A AND 2B, CA 19-9, AND CLINICAL/IMAGING FEATURES. OUR EXPECTED RESULTS WILL ALLOW CLINICIANS TO TIMELY RESECT IPMNS WITH HIGH MALIGNANT POTENTIAL BEFORE PROGRESSION TO INVASIVE CANCER, WHILE AVOIDING UNNECESSARY SURGERIES. DETECTING EARLY-STAGE PDAC WILL SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE PATIENT SURVIVAL.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null,

SEVERAL DIFFICULTIES, SUCH AS PATIENT INCONVENIENCE, MULTISTEP COMPLICATED PROCEDURE, PARTIAL SAMPLINGS, AND NON-SPECIFIC FINDINGS, MAKE THIS PROCESS SLOW, INVASIVE, EXPENSIVE, UNFIT FOR SCREENING LARGE SAMPLE SIZES, AND ERROR-PRONE. NON-INVASIVE SELECTIONS OF BIOMARKERS IN BODY FLUIDS, KNOWN AS LIQUID BIOPSY, OFFER GREAT PROMISE IN COMPLEMENTING OR EVEN SUBSTITUTING SURGICAL TISSUE BIOPSY IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS OF CANCER PATIENTS.

IN AIM 3, WE WILL IDENTIFY THE ABUNDANT MIRNAS IN TUMOR TISSUES AND SERUM SAMPLES OF TNBC-CARRYING PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFT (PDX) MICE VIA MIRNA SEQUENCING AND APPLY OUR SINGLE-MOLECULE MULTIPLEXED PLATFORM TO DETECT THOSE TNBC MIRNAS IN SERUM SAMPLES FROM THE PDX MICE. OUR PROPOSED APPROACH OFFERS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT INNOVATIONS INCLUDING I) A GENERIC PLATFORM FOR ERROR-FREE DETECTION OF MIRNAS, II) ULTIMATE SENSITIVITY VIA SINGLE-MOLECULE DETECTION, III) SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION OF MULTIPLE BIOMARKERS IN THE SAME SAMPLE - ALLOWING HIGH-CONFIDENCE DETECTION, AND IV) TARGET LABELING AND AMPLIFICATION ARE NOT REQUIRED. THEREFORE, THIS MULTIPLEXED PLATFORM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGY IN THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER.

HE HAS ADAPTED THE METHOD TO HIGH RESOLUTION 3D IMAGING OF SELECTED FIELDS OF VIEW (~103 CELLS USING DECONVOLUTION MICROSCOPY) AS WELL AS RAPID ANALYSIS OF WHOLE SLIDES (~106 CELLS) AT LOWER RESOLUTION. AS DEVELOPED CYCIF CAN COLLECT DATA FROM 20-60 PROTEIN MARKERS FROM A SINGLE SPECIMEN MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY CELL TYPES AND STATES IN A PRESERVED TISSUE ENVIRONMENT. IT CAN ALSO IMAGE STRUCTURES AS SMALL AS IMMUNE SYNAPSES ALLOWING CELL-CELL INTERACTIONS TO BE ANALYZED AT A FUNCTIONAL LEVEL. DR.

THE METHOD FOR DIAGNOSING AND TREATING NMSCS REQUIRES A SKIN BIOPSY THAT IS PROCESSED AND STAINED FOR ANALYSIS ON A STANDARD OPTICAL MICROSCOPE. THIS PROCESS IS PAINFUL FOR PATIENTS, AND THE INVASIVENESS OF BIOPSY INTRODUCES A DELAY INTO NMSC DETECTION, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO PATIENT MORBIDITY AND ADDS SUBSTANTIAL COST TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ENSPECTRA HEALTH\u2019S MISSION IS TO BRING DIGITAL ONCOLOGY DIAGNOSTICS TO THE POINT-OF-CARE FOR EARLIER CANCER DETECTION WHERE THE HEALTHCARE COST AND BURDEN TO PATIENTS IS MINIMAL. CANCER IS AN INHERENTLY CELLULAR DISFUNCTION, AND YET MODERN MEDICINE STILL LACKS THE BASIC ABILITY TO VIEW CELLULAR HISTOLOGY WITHOUT BIOPSY.

BUT DETERMINING WHICH SMOKERS SHOULD GET LDCT SCREENING IS CONTROVERSIAL AND POTENTIALLY HARMFUL. RECENTLY, THE U.S PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE (USPSTF) UPDATED THEIR OPINION ON SCREENING TO RECOMMEND ANNUAL LDCT SCREENING FOR CURRENT OR RECENT SMOKERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 50 AND 80 WHO HAVE SMOKED 20 PACK YEARS (PY) OR MORE. IN ADDITION, THEY SPECIFICALLY CALLED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOMARKER-BASED METHODS TO PREDICT WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM SCREENING.  PRECISION EPIGENETICS MAY ANSWER THIS CALL. IN 2012, WE SHOWED THAT DNA METHYLATION AT CG05575921, A SITE IN THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) GENE, PREDICTS SMOKING STATUS. SINCE THEN, OVER 100 STUDIES HAVE REPLICATED THOSE FINDINGS. IN 2018, WE DEVELOPED SMOKE SIGNATURE\u00a9, A PRECISE, REFERENCE FREE METHYLATION SENSITIVE DIGITAL PCR (MSDPCR) ASSAY FOR THIS LOCUS. IN PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE RECEIVER OPERATOR CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) FOR THIS ASSAY IS 0.984 FOR DAILY SMOKERS, THE AMOUNT OF DEMETHYLATION ACCURATELY PREDICTS DAILY CONSUMPTION AND THAT THE RE-METHYLATION RESPONSE TO SMOKING CESSATION CAN BE USED TO MONITOR SUCCESS OF CESSATION THERAPY.  INTRIGUINGLY, IN 2017, BOJESEN AND COLLEAGUES SHOWED THAT CG05575921 METHYLATION ALSO PREDICTS THOSE SMOKERS LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM LDCT SCREENING. RECENTLY, WE HAVE NOW CONFIRMED AND EXTENDED THESE FINDINGS USING A SUBSET OF DNA SPECIMENS FROM THE NATIONAL LUNG SCREENING TRIAL (NLST). IN PARTICULAR FOR THOSE NLST SUBJECTS WHO REPORTED QUITTING SMOKING, OUR METHOD SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTS LUNG CANCER RISK BETTER THAN PY ALONE IN A RACIAL AND GENDER-FREE MANNER. HOWEVER, OUR METHOD IS BASED ONLY THE DATA FROM 3200 NLST SUBJECTS, ALL OF WHOM SMOKED 30 PY OR MORE.  IN THIS PHASE II PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO FINISH OUR ASSESSMENTS OF THE 4800 NLST SUBJECTS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE > 30 PY OF CONSUMPTION AND LDCT DATA, THEN USE DNA FROM 4800 SUBJECTS IN X-RAY ONLY ARM OF THE NLST AND 4800 SUBJECTS FROM THE PLCO COLLECTION TO EXTEND THE RANGE OF OUR TEST DOWN TO 20 PY OF CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION. WE WILL THEN ANALYZE THE RESULTING DATA AND DEVELOP A RACE AND SES BIAS FREE COX REGRESSION FORMULA TO PREDICT RISK FOR THOSE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 50-80 YEARS AND >20 PY OF SMOKING.

THE CURRENT STANDARD OF THERAPY FOR GBM COMPRISES SURGICAL RESECTION THEN RADIATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE HETEROGENEITY AND INVASIVE NATURE OF GBM TUMOR CELLS THERE IS A HIGH RATE (~80%) OF TUMOR RECURRENCE, LEADING TO DISMAL SURVIVAL RATES THAT HAVE NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN OVER 50 YEARS. ONE OF THE PRIMARY HURDLES TO IMPROVING THESE OUT- COMES IS THE LACK OF RELIABLE AND ACCURATE MEANS TO MONITOR TUMOR PROGRESSION AND TREATMENT RESPONSE. THE CURRENT STANDARD METHODS OF TUMOR MONITORING, DIRECT TISSUE BIOPSY AND EXTERNAL IMAGING, ARE NOT ABLE TO SAFELY PROVIDE ACCURATE, FOCAL, LONGITUDINAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TUMOR PROGRESSION AND TREATMENT RESPONSE THAT WOULD ALLOW CLINICIANS TO MODIFY TREATMENT REGIMEN TO IMPROVE SURVIVAL OUTCOMES.

IN ADDITION, CURRENT PATHOLOGY METHODS ONLY ASSESS ABOUT 1/10 OF 1% OF THE ENTIRE VOLUME OF THE REMOVED SPECIMEN. A CONSEQUENCE OF MARGIN UNDERSAMPLING IS THAT LOCAL RECURRENCE OCCURS IN 5-16% OF PATIENTS WITH PATHOLOGICALLY CLEAN MARGINS, SUGGESTING THAT ONE OR MORE REGIONS OF TUMOR HAD NOT BEEN SAMPLED DURING PATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS RESULTING IN TUMOR REMAINING IN THE PATIENT. NEW METHODS TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF BCS RESECTION INTRAOPERATIVELY ARE BEING DEVELOPED. ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING IS THE USE OF FLUORESCENT MOLECULAR PROBES TO \u201cLIGHT UP\u201d CANCER AND GUIDE RESECTION. ALL CURRENT PROBES, HOWEVER, REQUIRE LARGE DOSES OF IMAGING AGENT TO BE ADMINISTERED HOURS OR DAYS BEFORE SURGERY, AND REQUIRE EXTRA LABWORK, COMPLICATING A RELATIVELY SIMPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURE. MOREOVER, INFILTRATING CANCER CELLS IN TISSUES SURROUNDING THE MAIN MASS MAY NOT HAVE DEVELOPED A VASCULATURE, AND OUR WORK AND THAT OF OTHERS INDICATES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE SUCH TUMORS MAY NOT BE IDENTIFIED USING INJECTED AGENTS, WHICH USE SUCH VASCULATURE TO REACH THE DISEASED TISSUE. EXPLOITING INCREASED PROTEASE EXPRESSION AT THE EDGE OF BREAST CANCERS WE INTRODUCE THE NOVEL CONCEPT OF INTRAOPERATIVE IN VIVO TOPICAL ADMINISTRATION OF AN ACTIVATABLE, MICRODOSE, QUENCHED, FLUORESCENT MOLECULAR IMAGING PROBE TO IDENTIFY CANCER THAT MAY REMAIN IN THE SURGICAL CAVITY AFTER STANDARD- OF-CARE RESECTION.

THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT IHC IS A MAJOR TESTING FORMAT IN SURGICAL PATHOLOGY; A TYPICAL HOSPITAL IHC LAB HAS A TEST MENU OF APPROXIMATELY 200 DIFFERENT TESTS. AS A RESULT, IHC ANALYTIC ERROR RATES RANGE FROM 10 \u2013 30% AS COMPARED TO <1% FOR OTHER TYPES OF CLINICAL LABORATORY TESTING. THESE ERRORS AFFECT BOTH PREDICTIVE MARKERS (HER2, PD-L1) AS WELL AS DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS (E.G., TTF-1, P53).

FURTHERMORE, THE UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF ICIS OFTEN GIVES RISE TO SPECIFIC IMAGING PATTERNS OF TUMOR RESPONSE (E.G, PSEUDOPROGRESSION) THAT CANNOT BE EASILY RESOLVED USING CURRENT METHODS. DISEASE RESPONSE, ORGAN TOXICITY, AND LYMPHOID TISSUE IMMUNE ACTIVATION ARE INTERDEPENDENT; INFORMATION ON ALL THREE FACTORS MUST BE KNOWN TO CAPTURE THE COMPLETE LANDSCAPE OF IMMUNOTHERAPY RESPONSE. THE STATUS QUO IN ASSESSING RESPONSE NOT ONLY FAILS TO FULLY EXTRACT CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION FROM THE IMAGING DATA, BUT ALSO PROVIDES VERY LIMITED INFORMATION TO MEDICAL ONCOLOGISTS TO OPTIMIZE PATIENT MANAGEMENT.  IN THIS PHASE II SBIR PROJECT, AIQ SOLUTIONS WILL BUILD ON THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF OUR PHASE I PROJECT TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN CLINICAL NEED AND EXISTING PRODUCTS. BASED ON OUR PHASE I RESULTS, OUR SOFTWARE WILL MEET THE UNIQUE\u2013AND CURRENTLY UNMET\u2013NEEDS OF IMMUNOTHERAPY PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC CANCER BY PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF IMMUNOTHERAPY RESPONSE INCLUDING: (1) QUANTIFY TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS IN ALL LESIONS, (2) QUANTIFY IMMUNE-RELATED TOXICITIES IN CRITICAL ORGANS, (3) CALCULATE THE PROBABILITY OF ACHIEVING OPTI- MAL OVERALL CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS, AND (4) CALCULATE THE PROBABILITY OF IRAE. TO DO THIS, WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING AIMS AND MILESTONES. (1): COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT, REFINE PERFORMANCE, AND VALIDATE THE TRAQINFORM IMMUNO TECHNOLOGY. (2) PERFORM USABILITY ASSESSMENT OF THE TRAQINFORM IMMUNO TECHNOLOGY. (3) EVALUATE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION OUTPUT FROM THE TRAQINFORM IMMUNO TECHNOLOGY IN A PROSPECTIVE, NON-INTERVENTIONAL CLINICAL STUDY. UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE SBIR PHASE II, WE WILL HAVE COMPLETED DEVELOPMENT AND BASIC VALIDATION OF TRAQINFORM IMMUNO TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL BE POSITIONED TO SUBMIT FOR FDA CLEARANCE AND TO LAUNCH THE PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT WILL LEAD TO COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE TRAQINFORM IMMUNO TECHNOLOGY AS A PLATFORM TO BE USED BY CLINICIANS FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT OF IMMUNOTHERAPY-TREATED PATIENTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f26ac03a-6b62-49ca-4b54-e2610498f9e0-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44CA257253_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140657823, "Award ID": "R44CA257178", "Award Amount": 1887301.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-16", "CFDA Number": "93.395", "Description": "ULTRAFAST AND PRECISE EXTERNAL BEAM MONITOR FOR FLASH AND OTHER ADVANCED RADIATION THERAPY MODALITIES - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT FLASH RADIOTHERAPY (FLASH-RT) IS A NOVEL FORM OF RADIATION THERAPY THAT PROMISES LARGE SPARING OF NORMAL- TISSUES IN CANCER TREATMENT WHILE SHOWING NO TUMOR SPARING. IN FLASH-RT, THE RADIATION DOSE IS DELIVERED TO THE TUMOR AND NORMAL TISSUES IN MILLISECONDS RATHER THAN MINUTES. FLASH-RT IS ONLY EFFECTIVE WHEN GIVEN WITH LARGE DOSES PER FRACTION DELIVERED IN 1-3 TREATMENT SESSIONS. IT WOULD SHORTEN A STANDARD 30-DAY TREATMENT TO 1- 3 DAYS, THUS GREATLY REDUCING SIDE-EFFECTS AND RADIATION THERAPY COSTS TO BOTH THE PATIENT AND SOCIETY. THE FIRST HUMAN PATIENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY TREATED IN 2018. THE FIRST CLINICAL TRIAL WITH TEN (10) PATIENTS STARTED IN THE U.S. IN NOVEMBER 2020. ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS ARE PLANNED FOR 2021 IN THE U.S. AND IN EUROPE WITH AT LEAST 100 PATIENTS. A MAJOR LIMITATION OF FLASH-RT, PREVENTING A FAST TRANSLATION TO CLINICAL USE, IS THE LACK OF DETECTORS CAPABLE OF MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO MONITOR AND TERMINATE THE FLASH-RT TREATMENT IN REAL TIME. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A LARGE AREA, ULTRAFAST AND PRECISE EXTERNAL BEAM MONITOR FOR FLASH-RT, UNIVERSALLY SUITABLE FOR ELECTRONS, PROTONS, PHOTONS, AND IONS, THAT CAN TERMINATE THE BEAM IN =1 MS WHILE THE PATIENT IS BEING TREATED. FOR THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL PRIMARILY FOCUS ON DEVELOPING AND DEMONSTRATING THE SYSTEM FOR ELECTRON FLASH-RT WITH LINACS AND PROTON FLASH-RT WITH EXISTING CYCLOTRONS, BUT WILL ALSO DEMONSTRATE PERFORMANCE USING X-RAYS. UNLIKE STRIP OR WIRE IONIZATION CHAMBERS, THE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS BASED ON OUR PATENTED (JAN 2020 AND NOV 2020) IONIZING-RADIATION BEAM MONITORING SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY, WHICH CAN PROVIDE ULTRAFAST READOUT WITH CONCURRENT ANALYSIS OF THE RADIATION BEAM POSITION, PROFILE, AND FLUENCE/DOSIMETRY IN REAL TIME AT A RATE OF =10 KHZ (I.E., BEAM ANALYSIS =100 \u039cS). THE PROPOSED SYSTEM PROVIDES REAL-TIME DOSIMETRY, BEAM CONTROL, AND VERIFICATION FOR FLASH-RT. IT PROVIDES AN ACCURATE 2D POSITION AND BEAM PROFILE OF RAPIDLY SCANNED BEAMS WITH A SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF A FEW MICRONS OVER AN ACTIVE BEAM MONITORING AREA OF 26 CM X 30 CM. THE BEAM MONITOR RESPONSE IS LINEAR, WITHOUT SATURATION, FOR ALL FLASH-RT BEAM LUMINOSITIES. PROTON BEAM TESTING WILL BE PRIMARILY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ION BEAM LABORATORY, AND ELECTRON BEAM TESTING AT THE NOTRE DAME RADIATION LABORATORY. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM IS FOR 3-YEARS AND WILL EVOLVE FROM FABRICATION AND TESTING OF A QUARTER-SCALE BEAM MONITOR IN YEAR 1 TO A FULL-SIZE SYSTEM WITH SELF-CALIBRATION CAPABILITY IN YEAR 3. OUR PRINCIPAL COLLABORATORS ON THIS PROGRAM INCLUDE THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, PHYSICS DEPARTMENT, AND LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. THE PROPOSED BEAM MONITOR CONSTITUTES A CRITICAL ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL TYPES OF FLASH-RT. IT WILL ENSURE THE SAFETY, QUALITY, AND EFFICIENCY OF FLASH RADIATION THERAPY, ALLOWING CANCER PATIENTS TO BE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH MUCH HIGHER DOSES, FEWER SIDE-EFFECTS, AND EXCELLENT TUMOR CONTROL. IT IS ALSO SUITABLE FOR SPATIALLY FRACTIONATED RADIATION THERAPY TECHNIQUES SUCH AS GRID, LATTICE, MICROBEAM RT (MRT), AND PROTON-MINIBEAM RT (PMBRT).

WE HAVE THE TECHNICAL, MEDICAL AND POLICY TOOLS AND APPROACHES TO ELIMINATE IT. YET, ONE WOMAN DIES OF CERVICAL CANCER EVERY TWO MINUTES. CERVICAL CANCER IS THE THIRD LEADING MALIGNANCY AMONG WOMEN IN THE WORLD, AFTER BREAST AND COLORECTAL CANCER. CERVICAL CANCER IS ALSO ONE OF THE TUMORS IN WHICH THE MOST GLARING DISPARITIES EXIST WORLDWIDE. THE DRAMATIC DISPARITY IN INCIDENCE RATES BETWEEN HIGH- AND LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES IS DUE PRIMARILY TO DIFFERENTIAL ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE SCREENING AND PRE- CANCER, OR PREVENTIVE, TREATMENT; SIMILAR DISPARITIES ALSO EXIST WITHIN COUNTRIES. RECENTLY PUBLISHED HYSTERECTOMY-CORRECTED CERVICAL CANCER MORTALITY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES REVEAL A LARGER RACIAL DISPARITY IN BLACK WOMEN, THAT PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED AND SHOWS THAT THE OLDEST BLACK WOMEN HAVE THE HIGHEST CERVICAL CANCER MORTALITY RATES. NONETHELESS, MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF CASES AND 88 PERCENT OF DEATHS OCCUR IN LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS). THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) HAS DEVELOPED GUIDELINES FOR TREATMENT OF CERVICAL INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA 2-3 AND SCREEN-AND-TREAT STRATEGIES TO PREVENT CERVICAL CANCER. IN COUNTRIES WHERE MULTIPLE BARRIERS EXIST FOR CYTOLOGY BASED CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING, A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHMS ARE BEING USED, WHICH INCLUDE LOW-COST ONCOGENIC HPV TESTING, VISUAL INSPECTION WITH ACETIC ACID, AND SELF-COLLECTED VAGINAL SWABS. HPV TESTING IS AN EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE TO CYTOLOGY FOR CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, HPV TESTS IDENTIFIES WOMEN AT RISK FOR CERVICAL CANCER, BUT NOT THOSE HPV-POSITIVE WOMEN WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE, OR TO DEVELOP IN THE NEAR FUTURE, SIGNIFICANT DISEASE REQUIRING TREATMENT. CURRENT PRACTICE IS TO TRIAGE THESE WOMEN BY FURTHER TESTING WITH CYTOLOGY AND COLPOSCOPY-DRIVEN BIOPSIES IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND EXCISION OR ABLATION THERAPY IN LMICS. THE USE OF DNA BIOMARKERS CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN REFERRED TO COLPOSCOPY WHILE MAINTAINING ADEQUATE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY. IN THIS FAST TRACK SBIR PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY FOR THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF A PRECISION METHYLATION TEST, THE CERVICALMETHDX TEST, TO STRATIFY HPV+ PATIENTS FOR HIGH RISK OF CERVICAL CANCER, AS A REFLEX TEST TO EXISTING STANDARD OF CARE IN LMICS. OUR TEST WILL ENABLE IDENTIFICATION OF HPV+ WOMEN AT CLINICAL RISK FOR ADVANCEMENT FROM LOW-GRADE SQUAMOUS INTRAEPITHELIAL LESIONS (LSIL) TO CERVICAL INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA GRADE 3 (CIN3).

CHARGED PARTICLES ENTER THE PATIENT AT RELATIVISTIC SPEEDS, DEPOSITING INCREASINGLY MORE DOSE AS THEY COME TO REST INSIDE THE PATIENT. X-RAY PHOTON BEAMS DELIVER AN EXPONENTIALLY DECAYING DOSE ALONG THE BEAM PATH, DOSING HEALTHY TISSUE BEFORE AND AFTER THE TUMOR.  PROTON THERAPY CAUSES LESS COLLATERAL DAMAGE, AND WHEN PATIENT ALIGNMENT IS ACCURATE, DELIVERS LESS DOSE TO HEALTHY PROXIMAL TISSUE AND SPARES DISTAL TISSUE ALTOGETHER. TODAY, PATIENTS ARE POSITIONED BY MATCHING BONY STRUCTURES IN DAILY X- RAY IMAGES TO PLANNING CT VOLUMES ACQUIRED DAYS (OR WEEKS) PRIOR. INTER-FRACTION CHANGES TO SOFT TISSUE (WEIGHT LOSS, EDEMA) ARE COMMON AND INTRA-FRACTION CHANGES (DIGESTION, RESPIRATION, ETC.) ARE UNAVOIDABLE. RANGE ERRORS INCORRECTLY DOSE HEALTHY TISSUE AND UNDERTREAT THE TUMOR, LIMITING BENEFITS OF PROTON THERAPY. THEREFORE, THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR THERAPEUTIC RADIATION ONCOLOGY CURRENTLY SUPPORTS PROTON THERAPY FOR TUMORS NEAR THE BASE OF THE NECK, SPINE, EYE AND IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS, AND ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF RESEARCH STUDIES FOR MOST OTHER TUMOR SITES.  THERMOACOUSTIC RANGE VERIFICATION RELIES UPON STRESS CONFINEMENT AND IS SUITABLE FOR COMPACT SYNCHROCYCLOTRONS RECENTLY INTRODUCED BY TWO MANUFACTURERS, IBA AND MEVION. A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM HAS BEEN VALIDATED FOR USE WITH IBA SYSTEMS AND THE SAME RECEIVE CHAIN HAS BEEN VALIDATED FOR MEVION.  SYSTEM DESIGN FOR A THERMOACOUSTIC RANGE VERIFICATION (TARV) DEVICE WILL BE FINALIZED AND VALIDATED DURING PHASE II. THE TARV CONSISTS OF A WIRELESS ULTRASOUND ARRAY AROUND WHICH SIX THERMOACOUSTIC RECEIVERS ARE PACKED. A COMPACT (65MM X 55MM) DATA ACQUISITION (DAQ) BOARD PROVIDES 56-59 DB GAIN OVER THE THERMOACOUSTIC FREQUENCY RANGE OF 10-100 KHZ, SAMPLES AT 500 KSPS TO MINIMIZE ALIASING OF HIGH FREQUENCY NOISE, AND STORES DATA TO A SECURE DATA CARD ONBOARD. A COMPACT GAMMA DETECTOR MONITORS BEAM INTENSITY AND PROVIDES A TRIGGER TO THE DAQ.  END-TO-END VALIDATION REQUIRES SOFTWARE INTEGRATION WITH THE TREATMENT PLANNING SYSTEM (TPS) SOFTWARE USED IN RADIOTHERAPY CLINICS. FURTHERMORE, QA AND CLINICALLY REALISTIC TEST OBJECTS, CALLED PHANTOMS, ARE REQUIRED. THERMOACOUSTICS IS A HYBRID TECHNIQUE THAT COMBINES ASPECTS OF ULTRASOUND IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY. COMMERCIAL PHANTOMS DESIGNED FOR ULTRASOUND IMAGING HAVE NOT YET BEEN VETTED FOR RADIATION THERAPY.

TREATMENT WITH DRUG RELEASED FROM NANOPARTICLES - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: TRANSITIONAL CELL CARCINOMA (TCC) OF THE BLADDER IS THE FIFTH MOST COMMON FORM OF CANCER IN THE U.S., WITH OVER 80,000 NEW CASES EXPECTED IN 2019. FOR EARLY-STAGE CARCINOMAS, PATIENTS RECEIVE INTRAVESICAL BACILLUS CALMETTE-GUERIN (BCG) IMMUNOTHERAPY, OR TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION OF THE BLADDER TUMOR (TURBT) WITH INTRAVESICAL CHEMOTHERAPY. BOTH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGH RATE OF RECURRENCE AND EVENTUAL PROGRESSION. BCG FAILS MANY PATIENTS WHO ARE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED OR WHO EXPERIENCE ADVERSE REACTIONS, WHILE TURBT WITH CHEMOTHERAPY FAILS BECAUSE THE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY RETAINED IN THE BLADDER TO PENETRATE LESIONS THAT AREN\u2019T RESECTED. THUS, THERE IS A NEED FOR AN IMPROVED DRUG FORMULATION FOR EARLY-STAGE (CIS, TA, T1, T2) TCC CAPABLE OF 1) PENETRATING THE TUMOR BEYOND THE SUPERFICIAL CELL LAYERS, AND 2) INCREASING THE DWELL/CONTACT TIME BETWEEN THE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT AND THE CANCER CELLS. TO THAT END, NANOMEDTRIX (NMTX) HAS DEVELOPED A PARTICLE BASED ON MESOPOROUS SILICA NANOPARTICLES (MSN) THAT CARRIES KNOWN CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS AND IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THEIR SPECIFICITY, DWELL TIME, AND TUMOR PENETRATION. OUR PHASE I SBIR PROJECT EXCEEDED OUR GOALS AND DEMONSTRATED THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE MSN PARTICLES IN CARRYING AND RELEASING EPIRUBICIN IN VIVO IN A MURINE TCC ORTHOTOPIC MODEL AND IN VITRO USING CULTURED HUMAN TCC CELLS. THROUGH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE NIH I-CORPS PROGRAM WE SPOKE WITH KEY OPINION LEADERS (UROLOGIC ONCOLOGISTS) IN THE CLINICAL BLADDER CANCER SPACE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE COMPLETING OUR PHASE I WORK USING THE MSN TO DELIVER CLINICALLY RELEVANT DOSES OF GEMCITABINE, DOCETAXEL, AND MITOMYCIN-C IN THE SAME MODEL. FOLLOWING OUR PHASE I SUCCESS, OUR PHASE II SBIR IS DESIGNED TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION OF DATA REQUIRED BY THE FDA FOR INITIATION OF IND APPROVAL OF NMTX MSN IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS. SPECIFIC AIM 1 DESCRIBES THE NECESSARY IN VITRO TASKS: OPTIMIZING PARTICLE CHEMISTRY AND VALIDATING OUR LARGER CANINE MODEL USING CULTURED CELLS AND CANINE TCC ORGANOIDS. SPECIFIC AIM 2 DESCRIBES COMPLETION OF MURINE ORTHOTOPIC STUDIES AND THE START OF PRE-CLINICAL TRIALS IN DOGS WITH SPONTANEOUSLY OCCURRING TCC. SPECIFIC AIM 3 LAYS OUT OUR PLAN FOR CARRYING OUT CGMP SYNTHESIS, PACKAGING, AND ANALYSIS OF OUR IND. BEYOND SETTING THE STAGE FOR FDA IND APPROVAL AND FIRST-IN-HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS, PHASE II COMPLETION WILL STRENGTHEN OUR POSITION WITH INVESTORS/PARTNERS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, WITH WHOM WE WILL PARTNER IN SBIR PHASE IIB, PHASE III AND BEYOND TO EXPAND CLINICAL TRIALS AND ULTIMATELY COMMERCIALIZE THE TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE UROLOGY CONTACTS WE MADE IN I-CORPS WHO ARE EAGER TO PARTICIPATE IN CLINICAL TRIALS, AND WE HAVE RECEIVED INTEREST FROM PHARMA COMPANIES (BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB, UROVANT, AND OTHERS). OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY WILL PROVIDE LICENSEES WITH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE FROM ESTABLISHED CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE OFF-PATENT, THUS MAKING OUR TECHNOLOGY ATTRACTIVE BOTH CLINICALLY AND COMMERCIALLY.

DESPITE THIS, CURRENT CFDNA ASSAYS ARE CHALLENGED BY LIMITED SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN CELL TYPES AND DISEASE STATES. CFDNA IS PRIMARILY FOUND AS CELL-FREE NUCLEOSOMES (CFNUCS), WHICH CONSIST OF HISTONE OCTAMERS WRAPPED IN DNA. NUC FEATURES, SUCH AS THE PRESENCE AND GENOMIC LOCALIZATION OF HISTONE POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS (PTMS), PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN GENE REGULATION AND ARE HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH TISSUE TYPE AND DISEASE STATE. AS SUCH, THE EPIGENOMIC ANALYSIS OF CFNUCS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DELIVER A TRANSFORMATIVE METHOD OF RESEARCH THAT CAN PROVIDE THE SPECIFICITY REQUIRED TO DIAGNOSE AND DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN DISEASES THAT IS LACKING FROM CURRENT ASSAYS.  TO MEET THIS NEED, EPICYPHER IS DEVELOPING CFNUC-SEQ, THE FIRST COMMERCIAL PLATFORM FOR THE EPIGENOMIC ANALYSIS OF HISTONE PTMS ON CFNUCS. PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP APPROACHES FOR ANALYSIS OF HISTONE PTMS ON CFNUCS EXHIBITED LOW SENSITIVITY AND WERE NOT TRULY QUANTITATIVE.

IMPLEMENTATION OF MINIMALLY-INVASIVE ROUTINE SCREENING, SUCH AS PAP SMEARS FOR CERVICAL CANCER, HAS PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR REDUCING CANCER MORTALITY. HOWEVER, SEVERAL CHALLENGES PREVENT SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SCREENING IN MOST CANCERS, ESPECIALLY ONES WHICH ARE NOT READILY ACCESSIBLE FOR IMAGING OR TISSUE BIOPSY. ONE PROMISING AVENUE FOR CANCER DIAGNOSTICS IS THROUGH USE OF CIRCULATING DNA FROM SO-CALLED \u201cLIQUID BIOPSIES\u201d OR OTHER ACCESSIBLE SAMPLE MEDIA CIRCULATING THROUGHOUT THE BODY COLLECTING GENETIC MATERIAL FROM TISSUES, INCLUDING TUMORS. TUMOR-SPECIFIC MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS, SUCH AS DNA MUTATIONS AND METHYLATION, CAN BE FOUND IN MINIMALLY-INVASIVE SAMPLE MEDIA, SUCH AS BLOOD, STOOL, AND URINE, BUT ARE TYPICALLY ONLY PRESENT IN VERY LOW COPY NUMBERS (<10 COPIES/ML) AND LOW FRACTIONS (<0.1%) AMONG A HIGH BACKGROUND OF HEALTHY DNA. TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS AS WELL AS PRACTICAL INACCESSIBILITY OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TOOLS HAVE PRECLUDED RESEARCH EFFORTS TO DISCOVER EARLY-STAGE CANCER- SPECIFIC DNA BIOMARKER PANELS AND SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATION THAT COULD IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. TO ADDRESS THIS, WE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE DIGITAL MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM TO FACILITATE HIGHLY SENSITIVE, LOW-COST DETECTION OF CANCER-SPECIFIC DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS BY HIGHLY PARALLELIZED SINGLE-MOLECULE THERMODYNAMIC SEQUENCING. IN THIS PHASE 1 SBIR PROPOSAL, WE WILL GREATLY EXPAND UPON THE CAPABILITIES OF THIS PLATFORM TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY AND IMPROVE ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE TOWARDS DETECTION OF EARLY-STAGE DISEASE BY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING ITS DIGITIZATION POWER. WE WILL DEVELOP A HIGH-DEGREE MULTIPLEXING PARADIGM FOR DETECTION AND METHYLATION PROFILING OF BIOMARKER PANELS USING A MULTICOLOR BARCODING TECHNIQUE.

THE BROAD, LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO ENABLE REAL-TIME DIAGNOSTICS OF PATHOLOGY SAMPLES AT THE POINT-OF-CARE.  EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LUNG CANCER IS ESSENTIAL; THE SURVIVAL RATE IS LOW AND IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE STAGE OF THE DISEASE. PRIMARY DIAGNOSES THROUGH MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF BIOPSIES (FNAS) HAVE A 20-40% FAILURE RATE DUE TO INADEQUATE SPECIMENS. AS A RESULT, REPEAT BIOPSIES MUST BE PERFORMED CAUSING DELAYS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT UP TO 90 DAYS, WHICH IS ENOUGH TIME FOR CANCER TO UPSTAGE AND CAN REDUCE SURVIVABILITY BY AS MUCH AS 20%. RAPID- ONSITE (ROSE) ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY BY A PATHOLOGIST CAN GUARANTEE THE DIAGNOSTIC QUALITY OF BIOPSIES BUT IS PERFORMED IN <10% OF LUNG BIOPSIES DUE TO FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL BARRIERS.  IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO OVERCOME THE HISTORICAL BARRIERS TO ROSE TO STANDARDIZE THE PROCEDURE FOR LUNG BIOPSIES. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH TWO KEY INNOVATIONS: (I) THE APPLICATION OF A NOVEL MICROSCOPY MODALITY (CODED PTYCHOGRAPHY MICROSCOPY - CPM) FOR DIGITAL PATHOLOGY; AND (II) IMAGING AND AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF UNSTAINED LUNG FNAS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) OBJECT DETECTION ALGORITHMS.

CERVICAL CANCER ACCOUNTED FOR 341,800 DEATHS IN 2020, WITH APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THESE DEATHS OCCURRING IN LMICS. TREATMENTS FOR PRECANCEROUS LESIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE FOR PREVENTING CANCER PROGRESSION, SO THE KEY IS TO IDENTIFY AND TREAT LESIONS EARLY. HOWEVER, MOST LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES THAT OFFER CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING LACK ACCESSIBLE TREATMENT SERVICES. THE LACK OF READILY ACCESSIBLE TREATMENT OPTIONS MEANS REFERRAL OF PATIENTS TO LARGER HOSPITALS, WHICH IS AN OBSTACLE TO PROPER TREATMENT, LEADING TO DISEASE PROGRESSION TO CANCER. WHILE LOOP ELECTROSURGICAL EXCISION PROCEDURE IS THE GOLD STANDARD IN THE TREATMENT OF LESIONS, IT REQUIRES HIGHLY TRAINED CLINICIANS AND AN OPERATING ENVIRONMENT RARELY FOUND IN LMIC CLINICS. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION RECOMMENDS CRYOTHERAPY FOR CERVICAL PRECANCER TREATMENT IN LMICS, BUT THE KEY DRAWBACK FOR CURRENT CRYOTHERAPY SYSTEMS IS THEIR DEPENDENCE ON CONSUMABLE CRYOGEN GAS. ACCESS TO A CRYOGEN GAS SUPPLY IS UNRELIABLE, CONSUMABLE GAS COSTS ARE HIGH, AND HEAVY AND BULKY GAS CYLINDERS LIMIT PORTABILITY TO REMOTE CLINICS. OTHER LMIC-TARGETED OPTIONS HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED, BUT THEY WERE POORLY ADOPTED DUE TO HIGH COST AND DISCONTINUED MANUFACTURER SUPPORT (CRYOPEN) OR INSUFFICIENT DEPTH OF TISSUE NECROSIS FOR FULLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT (HEAT-BASED THERMAL ABLATION). TAKEN TOGETHER, NO SINGLE SYSTEM EXISTS TO PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION THAT IS SUITABLE FOR WIDESPREAD LMIC USE.

WHILE IMAGE GUIDANCE AND CONFORMAL PLANNING REDUCED THE DOSE TO HEALTHY TISSUE, THERE IS STILL A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF TISSUE DAMAGE THAT SETS THE UPPER LIMIT OF DOSE DEPOSITED TO THE TUMOR. A RECENT RADICAL APPROACH TO MINIMIZE HEALTHY TISSUE DAMAGE WAS DEMONSTRATED WITH ULTRA-HIGH DOSE RATE IRRADIATION, AND IS KNOWN AS THE FLASH EFFECT. THIS TREATMENT OPERATES AT DOSE RATES 1000X HIGHER THAN IN CONVENTIONAL MODE, AND BY DELIVERING AN ENTIRE TREATMENT COURSE IN 100 MILLISECOND, IT PROMISES A REDUCTION OF RADIATION-INDUCED TOXICITIES BY 10-50%. SEVERAL CLINICAL CENTERS, INCLUDING DARTMOUTH HITCHCOCK CLINIC, DEMONSTRATED THAT AN EXISTING CLINICAL LINAC CAN BE REVERSIBLY CONVERTED INTO AN ULTRA-HIGH DOSE RATE ELECTRON SOURCE. THIS MODIFICATION SHOWS ENORMOUS TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL TO DELIVER ELECTRON FLASH (EFLASH) IN ANY RADIOTHERAPY CENTER USING EXISTING SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, WHILE MOST RESEARCH IN THE FIELD IS FOCUSED ON ELUCIDATING THE RADIOBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF FLASH, WORK TOWARDS MITIGATING THE RISKS OF FLASH IS LARGELY UNTOUCHED, YET WILL BE PIVOTAL FOR WIDE CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATION. NEW TECHNIQUES FOR DETECTION MONITORING RADIATION NEED TO BE DEVELOPED DUE TO THE MILLISECOND TIMESCALES AT WHICH FLASH OPERATES WHICH MAKE TRADITIONAL METHODS UNSUITABLE.

BEAMSITE IMAGES ARE USED BY RADIATION THERAPISTS TO MONITOR RADIATION DELIVERY REAL-TIME. CLINICAL USE HAS SHOWN THAT ROUTINE MONITORING OF RADIOTHERAPY CAN REVEAL SUB-OPTIMAL DELIVERY WHICH CAN BE ADDRESSED BY THE THERAPISTS AS NEEDED. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT OFFERS AN AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF BEAM AND PATIENT MISALIGNMENTS AND DELIVERY ERRORS, AND THEREFORE IT IS VERY SCALABLE EVEN TO THE ULTRA-FAST FLASH APPLICATION.

MAMMOGRAPHY AND TOMOSYNTHESIS NOT ONLY CAUSE DISCOMFORT TO PATIENTS, BUT THEIR OUTCOME IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE PATIENT\u2019S BREAST DENSITY: BREAST DENSITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED DETECTION SENSITIVITY IN BOTH IMAGING TECHNIQUES. ULTRASOUND HAS A LOW-RESOLUTION, IS HIGHLY USER- DEPENDENT, AND CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING; MRI IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT NEED, THEREFORE, FOR AN IMAGING MODALITY THAT ADDRESSES THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES, PRIORITIZES PATIENT EXPERIENCE, AND REDUCES HEALTH CARE COSTS OF DETECTING CANCER. SOLUTION - MALCOVA HAS DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED A MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT OF A DEDICATED BREAST CT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES 3D IMAGES OF BOTH BREASTS, SIMILAR TO BREAST MRI, IN 30 SECONDS OF SCAN TIME, AT MAMMOGRAPHIC DOSE LEVELS, WITHOUT APPLYING BREAST COMPRESSION.

NOTWITHSTANDING THESE ADVANCES, A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF PATIENTS FAILS TO RESPOND TO IMMUNOTHERAPY AND SUFFERS FROM SERIOUS ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. WHILE PEPTIDE-LOADED MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX (PMHC) TETRAMERIC STRUCTURES ALLOW THE DETECTION OF ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC T CELLS, A FEW ANTIGEN SPECIFICITIES CAN BE DETECTED IN PARALLEL BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE FLUORESCENT OR METAL LABELS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THOUSANDS OF CELLS ARE NEEDED FOR THE WORKFLOW. IMPROVED PROGNOSTIC METHODS TO MONITOR THE SPECIFICITY AND FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR OF TUMOR ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CYTOTOXIC T CELLS IS GREATLY NEEDED TO ENHANCE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF A RANGE OF IMMUNOTHERAPIES, ESPECIALLY ADOPTIVE CELL THERAPY (ACT), AND PROVIDE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR CANCER PATIENTS. THIS PROJECT DEVELOPS A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND BIOSENSOR PLATFORM THAT ENABLES THE RAPID AND PARALLEL DETECTION OF ANTIGEN- SPECIFIC T CELLS. THE PROPOSED LAB-ON-CHIP TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION AT A SINGLE-CELL LEVEL WITHOUT REQUIRING THE USE OF LABELING, COMPLICATED OPERATIONAL CONTROLS, OR EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT. AS A RESULT, THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN POINT-OF-CARE SETTINGS AND RAPIDLY PROVIDE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION, SUCH AS THE IDEAL TIMING OF FUTURE INJECTED DOSES AND ANY OFF-TARGET EFFECTS. THE KEY INNOVATIONS BEHIND THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE ITS HIGH-THROUGHPUT BIOSENSOR ARCHITECTURE, THE ABILITY TO SCALE-UP MANUFACTURING USING EXISTING SILICON FOUNDRIES, LABEL-FREE CELL DETECTION, SIMPLE OPERATION AND PRODUCT DESIGN, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NOVEL ALGORITHMS OF ROBUST, REAL-TIME DATA ANALYSIS. MOREOVER, THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS FACILITATED BY A MATURE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY TO ACHIEVE THIS HIGH LEVEL OF MULTIPLEXING IN A SMALL FORM FACTOR.

DURING IRRADIATION, SENSITIVE REGIONS SUCH AS THE SALIVARY GLANDS CAN SUSTAIN INJURY, RESULTING IN XEROSTOMIA (DRY MOUTH). THIS SIDE EFFECT IS COMMON AND CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE QUALITY OF LIFE DURING AND POST-TREATMENT. THE FOCUS OF THIS APPLICATION IS PREDICTION DURING TREATMENT PLANNING OF WHETHER PATIENTS WILL SUFFER HIGH-GRADE XEROSTOMIA (NCI CTCAE GRADE 2-3) AT THE TIME OF THEIR FIRST POST-TREATMENT FOLLOW-UP VISIT, TYPICALLY 3-6 MONTHS AFTER RT (PREVALENCE IS APPROXIMATELY 40%).

IN THIS PHASE 1 PROJECT, ONCOSPACE INC. WILL DEVELOP A CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION TREE (CART) PREDICTION MODEL USING OVER 1200 COMPLETE HNC PATIENT RECORDS. ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HIGH-GRADE XEROSTOMIA AND A WIDE RANGE OF DOSIMETRIC, CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC FEATURES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY DISCOVERED AND THE FEATURES WITH THE STRONGEST ASSOCIATIONS WILL POPULATE THE NODES OF A DECISION TREE. THE TERMINAL LEAF NODES WILL EACH CONTAIN THE PROBABILITY OF HIGH-GRADE XEROSTOMIA FOR THE SUBSET OF PATIENTS IN THAT NODE. IN ADDITION, LEAF NODES WILL BE ASSIGNED BINARY CLASS LABELS DESIGNATING A HIGH- OR LOW RISK OF HIGH-GRADE XEROSTOMIA.

POPULATE ONCOSPACE INC.\u2019S MICROSOFT AZURE COSMOSDB DATABASE WITH DATA LICENSED FROM JOHNS HOPKINS  UNIVERSITY, INCLUDING STEPS SUCH AS PATIENT DE-IDENTIFICATION, DATA CURATION, AND ADDITIONAL DATASET FEATURE ENGINEERING  2. PERFORM CART MODELING AND TEST MODEL ACCURACY, USING SEPARATE TRAINING AND TEST DATASETS AND A VARIETY  OF PERFORMANCE METRICS, INCLUDING SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AUC, AND F1-SCORE.  3. DESIGN A CLINICALLY ACCEPTABLE RISK CLASSIFICATION STRATEGY AND A USER INTERFACE (UI) TO COMMUNICATE MODEL  RESULTS. EXPERT INPUT FROM A TEAM OF UI CONSULTANTS AND THREE RADIATION ONCOLOGISTS WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART  OF THE DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, AND EVALUATION PROCESSES. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL DEMONSTRATE THE CLINICAL AND COMMERCIAL FEASIBILITY OF A XEROSTOMIA PREDICTION MODEL FOR HNC. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN PHASE 2 WILL INCLUDE DEEPER MODEL PERSONALIZATION VIA INCORPORATION OF ADVANCED IMAGE FEATURES (RADIOMICS), AS WELL AS VALIDATION OF MODEL GENERALIZABILITY AND COMMERCIAL VIABILITY VIA THE CURATION AND USE IN MODEL BUILDING OF DATA FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS.

MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML) IS AN AGGRESSIVE CANCER OF THE BONE MARROW AND PERIPHERAL BLOOD WITH POOR PROGNOSIS MOSTLY DUE TO RELAPSE. DESPITE DECADES OF IMPROVEMENTS IN CHEMO-IMMUNOTHERAPY (CIT) AND, MORE RECENTLY, THE USE OF HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT (HMAS) AND ADDITION OF NOVEL SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS (SMIS) TO BACK-BONE CHEMOTHERAPY, AML TREATMENT SELECTION AND DOSAGE REMAINS MOSTLY EMPIRIC, WITH STANDARD FIRST- AND SECOND-LINE REGIMENS, EACH WITH POTENTIAL TOXIC CONSEQUENCES; DOSING IS BASED ON BODY SURFACE AREA, RENAL AND HEPATIC FUNCTION AND PHARMACOKINETICS/PHARMACODYNAMICS (PK/PD), IGNORING TUMOR-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS (TUMOR BULK, HETEROGENEITY AND CELL CYCLE KINETICS). CONSEQUENTLY, UP TO 60% OF PATIENTS ARE UNDER- OR OVER-DOSED AND A FURTHER 10-40% OF PATIENTS HAVE PRIMARY REFRACTORY DISEASE (NON-RESPONDERS) TO GOLD-STANDARD OF CARE FIRST-LINE CIT RESULTING IN POOR OUTCOMES WITH HIGH HEALTHCARE COSTS. ADVANCES IN GENOMIC TECHNIQUES ARE NOW ABLE TO ASSESS AML CLONAL DYNAMICS AND MEASURABLE RESIDUAL DISEASE IN PATIENTS THROUGHOUT THERAPY WITH REASONABLE TURN-AROUND TIMES. THIS RAPID GROWTH IN DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EVER-INCREASING NUMBER OF AVAILABLE FDA-APPROVED TARGETED TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WITH AML, PRESENT A CONSTANT AND ONGOING GAP BETWEEN PRACTICE AND POTENTIAL RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT LAG-TIME BETWEEN USE AND KNOW-HOW TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES. A FRAMEWORK FOR PERSONALIZED TREATMENT SELECTION AND OPTIMIZATION IS THEREFORE AN UNMET NEED IN PRECISION THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH AML. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, \u201cPCITTM SIMULATOR\u201d, A CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SERVICE, WAS DEVELOPED TO ASSIST ONCOLOGISTS WITH TREATMENT SELECTION BY PROVIDING (BEFORE TREATMENT BEGINS) SIMULATIONS OF DISEASE RESPONSE, PROGRESSION, AML CLONAL EVOLUTION AND NORMAL BLOOD COUNT RECOVERY IN PATIENTS RECEIVING THERAPY WITH DIFFERENT CIT, SMI AND HMA OPTIONS AND COMBINATIONS. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ON THE SELECTED TREATMENT FOR BEST PATIENT OUTCOME AND REDUCED TOXICITY, \u201cPCITTM OPTIMIZER\u201d, A SOFTWARE AS MEDICAL DEVICE, WAS DEVELOPED TO OPTIMIZE DRUG, DOSE AND SCHEDULE. PCITTM SIMULATOR AND OPTIMIZER PROVIDE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WITH CRITICAL DATA, PRIOR TO TREATMENT INITIATION, TO PREVENT OVER- OR UNDER-DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION OF INEFFECTIVE DRUGS FOR PATIENTS WITH RESISTANT DISEASE, THEREBY REDUCING TREATMENT AND HOSPITALIZATION COSTS. IN PHASE 1 OF THIS FAST- TRACK APPLICATION, SANICKA WILL DEVELOP ITS FIRST MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT BY (1) EXPANDING PCITTM TO INCORPORATE NOVEL SMIS/HMAS RESULTING IN THE LAUNCH TO THE MARKET OF PCITTM SIMULATOR AND (2) CREATING A WEB-BASED CLINICIAN PORTAL FOR ONCOLOGISTS TO UPLOAD PATIENT AND TUMOR DATA, AND VISUALIZE RESULTS. DURING PHASE 2, SANICKA WILL (1) EXPAND PCITTM OPTIMIZER TO CAPTURE AML SUB-CLONAL KINETICS AND SENSITIVITY TO CIT/SMIS/HMAS USING RETROSPECTIVELY-COLLECTED MULTI-CENTER PATIENT DATA FOR VALIDATION AND (2) PROSPECTIVELY VALIDATE PCITTM OPTIMIZER WITH AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY IN PATIENTS WITH AML AS THEY UNDERGO TREATMENT.

WE ARE DEVELOPING A NEW CLASS OF IMAGE- GUIDED TEMPORARILY DEPLOYABLE, ENDOVASCULAR CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES THAT SELECTIVELY REMOVE SPECIFIC DRUGS FROM THE BLOOD STREAM TO REDUCE SYSTEMIC TOXICITIES. THE PROPOSED CHEMOFILTERS INCORPORATE SPECIALIZED MATERIALS THAT BIND TARGET DRUGS IN SITU THROUGH A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS. DURING INTRAARTERIAL CHEMOTHERAPY (IAC) INFUSION TO A TARGET ORGAN (E.G., A SOLID ORGAN CONTAINING A TUMOR), EXCESS DRUG NOT TRAPPED IN THE TARGET ORGAN PASSES THROUGH TO THE VEINS DRAINING THE ORGAN AND THEN IS CIRCULATED TO THE REST OF THE BODY, CAUSING TOXICITIES IN DISTANT LOCATIONS. BY TEMPORARILY DEPLOYING A CHEMOFILTER IN THE VEIN(S) DRAINING THE ORGAN UNDERGOING IAC, WE SEEK TO BIND EXCESS DRUG BEFORE IT CAN ESCAPE TO CAUSE SYSTEMIC TOXICITY. THE CHEMOFILTER WOULD THEN BE REMOVED IN THE INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY SUITE SHORTLY AFTER THE IAC PROCEDURE, THUS REMOVING EXCESS DRUG FROM THE PATIENT. ALTHOUGH PAIRED INTRAATERIAL INFUSION AND VENOUS FILTRATION CAN THEORETICALLY BE USED FOR ANY DRUG THAT HAS ITS SITE OF THERAPEUTIC ACTION IN ONE LOCATION AND ITS SITE OF DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITY IN ANOTHER LOCATION, THE MOST COMPELLING APPLICATION FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY IS INCREASING EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF LOCOREGIONAL CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY.  PRIMARY AND METASTATIC LIVER TUMORS ARE AMONG THE TOP THREE CAUSES OF CANCER DEATH WORLDWIDE. IMAGE-GUIDED TRANSARTERIAL CHEMOEMBOLIZATION (TACE), A FORM OF IAC, COST-EFFECTIVELY INCREASES SURVIVAL IN THIS POPULATION. DOXORUBICIN (DOX) IS A LOW-COST, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT FREQUENTLY USED IN IAC. DOX USE IS LIMITED BY SYSTEMIC TOXICITIES, MOST IMPORTANTLY IRREVERSIBLE CARDIAC FAILURE. DOX FOLLOWS A THERAPEUTIC LINEAR DOSE-RESPONSE MODEL, IN WHICH INCREASING DOSE LINEARLY INCREASES TUMOR CELL KILL, PROVIDING MOTIVATION FOR HIGHER-DOSE DOX THERAPY. OUR INITIAL PROJECT HAS YIELDED CHEMOFILTERS THAT CAN REDUCE DOX DEPOSITION IN THE HEART BY 46% IN ANIMAL MODELS. WE SEEK TO BUILD UPON THAT SUCCESS BY DESIGNING, BUILDING, AND TESTING NEW DEVICES THAT CAN BE MORE EASILY NAVIGATED TO THE HEPATIC VEINS IN HUMAN PATIENTS.  PROTOTYPE CHEMOFILTERS WILL BE MODELED, BUILT, VALIDATED IN VITRO FOR EFFICACY, AND TESTED IN VIVO IN A LARGE ANIMAL MODEL FOR NAVIGABILITY IN PHASE I BY EXPERIENCED TEAMS FROM FILTRO, INC AND UCSF. IN PHASE II, THE OPTIMIZED DEVICES FROM PHASE I WILL THEN BE TESTED FOR EFFICACY AND SAFETY IN A LARGE ANIMAL MODEL AND A FIRST-IN-MAN SAFETY AND EFFICACY STUDY IN PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE LIVER CANCER WILL BE PLANNED AND INITIATED. ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE AIMS WILL CREATE NEW MINIMALLY INVASIVE MEDICAL DEVICES THAT SHOULD MARKEDLY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF IMAGE-GUIDED LOCOREGIONAL INTRAARTERIAL CHEMOTHERAPY BY LOWERING SYSTEMIC DRUG CONCENTRATIONS AND REDUCING SYSTEMIC TOXICITIES FOR THE USUAL DOSE OF DOX AS PART OF TACE.

THE GOAL OF THIS FAST-TRACK STTR IS TO DEVELOP A NEW SPECIFIC IMAGING AGENT FOR DIAGNOSIS, STAGING, AND TREATMENT OF THE HEMATOLOGICAL CANCER, MULTIPLE MYELOMA (MM). MM IS THE 2ND MOST COMMON BLOOD CANCER WITH AN ESTIMATED 32,000 NEW CASES AND 13,000 DEATHS PER YEAR. ACCURATE DETECTION IS CRITICAL FOR ENHANCING SURVIVAL IN MM PATIENTS. TRADITIONAL SKELETAL SURVEY AND BONE SCANS HAVE SENSITIVITY LIMITATIONS FOR OSTEOLYTIC LESIONS MANIFESTED IN MM. POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) PERFORMED WITH A PET RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL (IMAGING AGENT) IS A SENSITIVE, QUANTITATIVE AND NON-INVASIVE CLINICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY TO ACCURATELY DETECT, LOCALIZE AND PHENOTYPE MM CELLS THROUGHOUT THE BODY. 18F-FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE (FDG) IS THE ONLY FDA-APPROVED PET IMAGING AGENT FOR MM. UNFORTUNATELY, MM CELLS EXPRESS LOW LEVELS OF GLUT-1 TRANSPORTER AND HEXOKINASE, WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR FDG UPTAKE AND RETENTION. ADDITIONALLY MM BONE MARROW HARBORS FDG-AVID INFLAMMATORY CELLS. THERE IS AN UNMET NEED FOR MOLECULARLY TARGETED, SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC MM IMAGING AGENTS THAT CAN ACCURATELY STAGE AND RESTAGE MM, IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK MM PATIENTS, GUIDE PERSONALIZED MM TREATMENT, AND EVALUATE CLINICAL RESPONSE TO TREATMENT.

THE PHASE I SEGMENT CONSISTS OF TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) PERFORM DOSE ESCALATION AND SINGLE DOSE TOXICITY TESTING IN MICE. (2) COMPILE DATA FOR NEW DOSE AND SUBMIT AMENDMENT OF EIND TO FDA. THREE MILESTONES WILL BE MET IN PHASE I: (1) A NEW MASS WILL BE SELECTED BASED ON NO-OBSERVED-ADVERSE-EFFECT LEVEL (NOAEL), I.E. CLINICAL SIGNS OF ORGAN TOXICITY (VEHICLE VS EXPERIMENTAL). (2) BASED ON THE NEW DETERMINED MASS, AND IN VIVO PRECLINICAL IMAGE QUALITY DATA, A NEW SPECIFIC ACTIVITY (CI/MOL) WILL BE ESTABLISHED. (3) OBTAIN FDA APPROVAL OF SARYA SPONSORED AMENDED EIND APPLICATION. THE PHASE II SEGMENT INVOLVES A CLINICAL TRIAL AND HAS ONE SPECIFIC AIM: QUANTIFY THE EFFICACY OF 64CU-LLP2A-PET IMAGING FOR DETECTING ACTIVE MM IN HUMANS IN A PROSPECTIVE IMAGING TRIAL. PHASE II MILESTONES ARE: (1) DEMONSTRATE HIGH DETECTION RATES (% OF SCANS THAT ARE POSITIVE FOR A FOCAL LESION, P<0.05) FOR 64CU-LLP2A VERSUS FDG IN MM PATIENTS. (2) ACCURACY OF 64CU-LLP2A FOR ACTIVE MM WILL BE ASSESSED USING STANDARD-OF-CARE BONE MARROW (BM) BIOPSIES AND SERUM BIOMARKER M-PROTEIN LEVELS AS THE STANDARDS OF REFERENCE. A CORRELATION COEFFICIENT OF 0.7 WILL BE CONSIDERED REASONABLY STRONG. IN SUMMARY, PHASE I WILL PROVE FEASIBILITY THAT 64CU-LLP2A IS TOLERABLE WITH NOAEL RESULTING IN A NEW EIND.

MORE THAN HALF OF THEM IS UNAWARE OF THEIR DIAGNOSIS, BECAUSE THEIR FAMILY HISTORY IS UNINFORMATIVE OR UNKNOWN. GENETIC TESTING IS IMPORTANT FOR IDENTIFYING PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IN THIS PATHWAY, BUT IN A LARGE NUMBER OF CASES NO PATHOGENIC VARIANT OR A VARIANT OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE IS IDENTIFIED, LEADING TO AMBIGUOUS AND UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS. AS MORE PEOPLE ARE SEEKING TESTING FOR LS, ACCURATE ALTERNATIVES TO SEQUENCING ARE NEEDED TO PREDICT THE MOLECULAR PHENOTYPIC EFFECTS OF PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IN GENES IN THE MMR PATHWAY. RISK CLASSIFICATION SCORES BASED ON FLOW VARIANT ASSAYS (FVAS) ARE A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN ACCURATELY IDENTIFY PEOPLE WITH HETEROZYGOUS GERMLINE PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IN THESE PATHWAYS.

THIS ADDRESSES A CRITICAL NEED IN SURGICAL ONCOLOGY AS THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY RESIDUAL TUMOR LEADS TO IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL SURVIVAL, WHEREAS THE SPARING OF NORMAL TISSUE BENEFITS THE PATIENT\u2019S QUALITY OF LIFE. CURRENTLY, SURGEONS VISUALLY APPRECIATE THE PPIX FLUORESCENCE INTENSITY UNDER LOW-LIGHT CONDITIONS USING MODIFIED MICROSCOPES. THIS APPROACH IS QUALITATIVE AS THE PERCEPTION OF PPIX FLUORESCENCE INTENSITY IS INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS INCLUDING: 1) THE TYPE OF LIGHT SOURCE USED FOR ILLUMINATION, 2) THE MICROSCOPE\u2019S WORKING DISTANCE, 3) THE PRESENCE OF ENDOGENOUS ABSORBERS SUCH AS BLOOD, AND 4) NON-UNIFORM ILLUMINATION OF THE SURGICAL FIELD WHICH IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL AS RESIDUAL TUMOR PRESENT ON THE SIDES OF THE SURGICAL CAVITY MAY BE MISSED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT FLUORESCENCE EXCITATION. ADDITIONALLY, OPERATION UNDER LOW-LIGHT CONDITIONS DISRUPTS THE SURGICAL WORKFLOW.  OUR RESEARCH GROUP AT UC DAVIS HAS DEVELOPED A FLUORESCENCE LIFETIME (FLIM) BASED FGS APPROACH THAT IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE, QUANTITATIVE, AND INSENSITIVE TO ROOM LIGHT, ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF THE EXISTING 5-ALA FGS INSTRUMENTATION.

BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE BREAST CANCER TREATMENT PROCESS, THAT IS USED TO REBUILD A BREAST FORM THAT HAS BEEN REMOVED DUE TO CANCER SURGERY. IT IS INTEGRAL TO IMPROVING THE CANCER PATIENT'S HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. HOWEVER, PLANNING AND EVALUATION OF THE SURGERY ARE DONE SUBJECTIVELY, AND THE RESULT IS NOT ALWAYS AESTHETICALLY SATISFACTORY.  STANDARDS FOR BREAST RECONSTRUCTION HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, AND PATIENTS AND SURGEONS ALIKE EXPECT NATURAL, SYMMETRICAL -LOOKING SURGICAL OUTCOMES. SURGEONS RELY ON THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND ON SUBJECTIVE VISUAL ASSESSMENT SKILLS TO ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS. SIMILARLY, AESTHETIC OUTCOME ASSESSMENT METHODS, FOLLOWING SURGERY, ARE RATHER SUBJECTIVE, AND ARE BASED ON OBSERVER EVALUATION OF PHYSICAL CHANGES IN BREAST MORPHOLOGY AND SYMMETRY. WITH RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) IMAGING, THERE IS NOW AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT PERMIT USE OF BREAST MORPHOMETRY AND COMPUTERIZED SIMULATIONS FOR TREATMENT PLANNING, CLINICAL CONSULTATION, AND OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF POSTOPERATIVE RESULTS. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO STAND-ALONE, IMAGING-DEVICE INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE FOR A SURGEON TO AUTOMATE MEASUREMENTS FOR OBJECTIVELY FORMULATING A SURGICAL PLAN OR GENERATE REALISTIC SIMULATIONS OF BREAST SHAPE.  TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, WE PROPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE FOR QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF BREAST SHAPE. 3D IMAGING HAS BEEN VALIDATED FOR THE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF BREAST AESTHETICS BUT HAS SEEN LIMITED USE FOR SIMULATION AND SURGICAL PLANNING DUE TO THE EXORBITANT COSTS (~$100-300K) OF IMAGING EQUIPMENT AND LACK OF APPROPRIATE IMAGE ANALYSIS TOOLS. LOW-COST (~8K), PORTABLE HAND-HELD 3D SCANNERS ARE NOW AVAILABLE, BUT SOFTWARE FOR ENABLING BREAST MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS FOR SURGICAL PLANNING IS LACKING. IN THIS PHASE I STTR STUDY, SOFT IMAGING, LLC IS COLLABORATING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON (UH) AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER TO DEVELOP 3D IMAGE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE THAT WILL UTILIZE INNOVATIVE AND NOVEL 3D IMAGE ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS FOR ENABLING (1) AUTOMATED APPROACHES FOR BREAST MORPHOMETRY AND SURGICAL PLANNING AND (2) EMPLOY A PARAMETRIC MODELING APPROACH BASED ON 3D SPHERICAL HARMONICS (SPHARM) TO MODEL BREAST SHAPE, TO PROVIDE REALISTIC SIMULATIONS FOR VISUALIZATION DURING CLINICAL CONSULTATIONS.

THE FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE HAS NOT IMPROVED OVER THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AND THE MEDIAN SURVIVAL RATE FOR THOSE DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC CASTRATION RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER (MCRPC) IS ONLY 15-36 MONTHS. PRECISION MEDICINE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE MCRPC OUTCOMES. TRANSCIPTOMIC SEQUENCING OF CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS (CTCS) CAN PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING METASTATIC DISEASE AND IS AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO SERIAL BIOPSIES OF METASTATIC LESIONS AS BIOPSIES ARE DIFFICULT FOR SICK PATIENTS TO ENDURE AND THEY DO NOT ALWAYS YIELD A VIABLE TUMOR SPECIMEN FOR ANALYSIS. METASTATIC LESIONS ARE OFTEN ESTABLISHED FROM CTC PROGENITORS SEEDING A DISTANT SITE THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM OR LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. CURRENT METHODS FOR EXTRACTING AND ANALYZING CTCS FROM THE BLOODSTREAM ARE CLINICALLY LIMITED AS THEY ARE EXPENSIVE, INEFFICIENT, AND DO NOT YIELD ENOUGH CTCS TO CAPTURE ACTIONABLE BIOMARKERS, OFTEN ONLY OBTAINING 10 CTCS PER PROCEDURE. THUS, THERE REMAINS A MAJOR UNMET NEED TO IMPROVE THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN IDENTIFY AND ISOLATE CTCS FROM THE BLOODSTREAM OF PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC DISEASE. ASTRIN BIOSCIENCES WILL IMPROVE UPON CURRENT CTC TECHNOLOGIES BY DEVELOPING A NOVEL INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICINE PLATFORM THAT USES APHERESIS TO ISOLATE CTCS.

THE GAP IS DUE TO THE RADIATION DOSE CONFORMITY LIMITATIONS OF HDR-BT, AND, UNTIL A SOLUTION IS DEVELOPED, PROSTATE CANCER HDR-BT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE DOSE CONFORMITY LIMITATIONS DUE TO GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS, REQUIRING MULTIPLE NEEDLE IMPLANTS AND/OR A HOSPITAL STAY, AND CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVASIVE, CHALLENGING, AND TIME-CON- SUMING, WITH LIMITED PATIENT ACCESS. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO TRANSFER A TECHNOLOGY, CALLED RENEU, FOR GENERATING 169YB SOURCES THAT CAN DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE RADIATION DOSE CONFORMITY, INTO CLINICAL USAGE USING A BUSINESS MODEL BASED ON THE SUBSTANTIAL COST SAVINGS ACHIEVED THROUGH RE-ACTIVATION IN A NUCLEAR REACTOR. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNICAL MERIT, FEASIBILITY, AND COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF RENEU, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE THE ROTATING SHIELD BRACHYTHERAPY (RSBT) APPROACH TO IMPROVING DOSE CONFORMITY. 169YB IS AN IDEAL ISOTOPE FOR RSBT SINCE ITS SPECIFIC ACTIVITY IS HIGH ENOUGH TO MATCH THE DOSE RATE OF CONVENTIONAL 192IR IN A SIMILAR SOURCE VOLUME, AND THE EMITTED GAMMA RAY ENERGY IS LOW ENOUGH FOR PARTIAL SHIELDING. THE PROPOSED APPROACH FOR MAKING 169YB COMMERCIALLY FEASIBLE IS TO SIMPLY INCREASE SOURCE VOLUME FROM 1 MM3 TO 3 MM3, WHILE MAINTAINING THE CONVENTIONAL SOURCE DIAMETER. THE SOURCE COULD BE (RE)ACTIVATED UP TO 11 TIMES, AND, BASED ON PRELIMINARY WORK, THIS PROCESS COULD REDUCE THE OVERALL COST PER CLINIC-YEAR OF 169YB SOURCES BY 75%.

A DEMONSTRATION OF FEASIBILITY FOR THE RENEU APPROACH WILL BE ADDRESSED BY CARRYING OUT TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) DEVELOP A MECHAN- ICAL PROTOTYPE RENEU SOURCE/WIRE THAT ENABLES CLINICAL USAGE AND (2) DEVELOP THE (RE)ACTIVATION MODEL FOR RENEU TO VALIDATE ITS CLINICAL AND COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL. UNDER AIM 1, A 169YB SOURCE WILL BE CONSTRUCTED WITH A 3 MM3 VOLUME THAT, ALONG WITH ITS CONTROLLING GUIDEWIRE, WILL BE CAPABLE OF RE-ACTIVATION. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE SOURCE/WIRE WILL SUCCESSFULLY PASS THE TESTS NEEDED FOR FDA CLEARANCE. UNDER AIM 2, THE 169YB (RE)ACTIVATION MODEL BASED ON PRELIMINARY DATA WILL BE EXPERIMENTALLY CALIBRATED, WHICH WILL APPLY FOR UP TO 11 (RE)ACTIVATIONS. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT EACH (RE)ACTIVATION WILL TAKE 9 DAYS ON AVERAGE, WITH AN AVERAGE CLINICAL SOURCE LIFETIME AFTER EACH (RE)ACTIVATION OF 41 DAYS. THIS CONTRIBUTION IS EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT REMOVES A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO IMPROVING BRACHYTHERAPY THAT COULD BENEFIT PROSTATE AND CERVICAL CANCER PATIENTS.

USING SUCH METHODS, WE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF SERUM GLYCOPROTEINS WITH ALTERED GLYCOSYLATION IN HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, A PRIMARY CANCER OF THE LIVER. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY, WE WERE FORCED TO EITHER EXAMINE EACH PROTEIN ONE AT A TIME OR EXAMINE POOLS OF PROTEINS WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO LINK A PARTICULAR GLYCAN TO A GIVEN PROTEIN. IN SOME SITUATIONS, WE PERFORMED STRUCTURAL GLYCAN ANALYSIS ON PURIFIED PROTEINS WHICH PROVIDED THE BEST \u201cBIOMARKER\u201d INFORMATION, BUT TOOK DAYS TO WEEKS FOR ANALYSIS. ALTERNATIVELY, WE COULD FORGO TRUE STRUCTURAL INFORMATION AND USE LECTINS TO DETERMINE IF ONLY ONE SPECIFIC SUGAR MOIETY WAS PRESENT, AND PERFORM ANALYSIS IN A MORE RAPID MANNER.

TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, THIS TEAM DEVELOPED A NEW SURGICAL PROCEDURE CALLED IMAGE-GUIDED VIDEO THORACOSCOPIC SURGERY (IVATS), IN WHICH THE SURGEON LOCALIZES AND RESECTS SMALL LUNG NODULES BY MARKING THEM PERCUTANEOUSLY USING A FIDUCIAL MARKER, A SMALL PASSIVE METAL TAG CALLED T-BAR, PLACED UNDER C-ARM CT IMAGE-GUIDANCE. A NOVEL NAVIGATION TECHNOLOGY, NAVISCI\u2122, WAS DEVELOPED TO AID IN IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING LUNG TUMORS BY USING AN ACTIVE SENSING NODULE MARKER, CALLED J- BAR, THAT IS PLACED IN THE LUNG JUST NEXT TO THE TUMOR AND CAN TRACK THE TUMOR POSITION IN REAL-TIME AND HELP ASSESS MARGINS. HOWEVER, USE OF THE J-BAR REQUIRES EITHER INTRAOPERATIVE IMAGING OR APPROXIMATE VISUAL POSITIONING OF VERY SMALL TUMORS THAT MAY NOT BE VISIBLE DURING SURGERY FROM THE LUNG SURFACE. NAVIGATION SCIENCES IS NOW DEVELOPING A TUMOR MARKER THAT CAN BE POSITIONED WITH A BRONCHOSCOPE AND DOES NOT REQUIRE CT IMAGING DURING SURGERY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I STTR PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE NAVISCI-ENDOMARKERTM (CALLED ENDOMARKER HEREAFTER) TO ACCURATELY LOCALIZE SMALL LUNG TUMORS. THE ENDOMARKER WILL BE POSITIONED ADJACENT TO THE TUMOR WITH A BRONCHOSCOPE BASED ON NAVIGATION PLANNED USING DIAGNOSTIC CT IMAGES. THIS WILL SIMPLIFY THE CLINICAL WORKFLOW AND MAKE THIS PROCEDURE ACCESSIBLE TO HOSPITALS THAT DO NOT HAVE ADVANCED INTRA-OPERATIVE IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES. AIM 1 IS TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP THE BRONCHOSCOPIC ENDOMARKER. AIM 2 IS TO VALIDATE THE WORKFLOW FOR DEPLOYING THE ENDOMARKER, MECHANICAL STABILITY, AND ELECTRICAL ISOLATION OF THE ENDOMARKER IN A 3D PRINTED LUNG PHANTOM, EX VIVO PORCINE LUNGS AND 2 LIVE PIGS. THIS STTR PROJECT IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN NAVIGATION SCIENCES AND ONGOING COLLABORATORS AT THE BRIGHAM AND WOMEN\u2019S HOSPITAL (BOSTON, MA). THE PROPOSED R&D PROJECT IS SIGNIFICANT SINCE IT ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM OF ACCURATELY LOCALIZING AND RESECTING LUNG NODULES WHILE PRESERVING HEALTHY LUNG FUNCTION, WHICH COULD BENEFIT THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS EACH YEAR. THE NOVELTY LIES IN THE DESIGN OF THE ENDOMARKER, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE J-BAR MARKER TO BE PLACED ACCURATELY VIA A BRONCHOSCOPE SO THAT IT CAN READILY LOCALIZE SMALL TUMORS AND DEFINE THEIR MARGINS DURING SURGERY.

IN THE SETTINGS WHERE IT IS AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE, ESCC DIAGNOSIS IS MADE USING THE HIGHLY INVASIVE AND EXPENSIVE PROCEDURE KNOWN AS ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY (EGD, ALSO REFERRED TO AS UPPER ENDOSCOPY). HOWEVER, CITIZENS OF UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES OFTEN DO NOT HAVE WIDESPREAD ACCESS TO EGD; THUS, THERE IS A PRESSING NEED FOR EASIER, SAFER, CHEAPER, MORE ACCESSIBLE ESCC DIAGNOSTIC STRATEGIES.

SKIN CANCER IS THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCER IN THE US. BIOPSY OF SUSPICIOUS SKIN LESION IS THE KEY STEP OF SKIN CANCER DIAGNOSIS. 15-20 MILLION SKIN BIOPSIES ARE PERFORMED IN THE US ANNUALLY. ONCE BIOPSIED TISSUE IS REMOVED FROM A PATIENT, THE BIOPSY SPECIMEN IS TRANSPORTED TO AN OFF-SITE LABORATORY FOR PROCESSING AND STAINING. FINALLY, A PATHOLOGIST RENDERS A DIAGNOSIS BY ANALYZING THE SPECIMEN UNDER MICROSCOPY. THIS PROCESS IS INVASIVE, SLOW, AND BURDENSOME IN COST FOR THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. A DIAGNOSIS CAN TAKE AS MANY AS 2-4 WEEKS, WHICH DELAYS TREATMENT UPON A SUBSEQUENT VISIT, INCREASING PHYSICIAN UTILIZATION AND PATIENT WAIT TIMES. ADDITIONALLY, THE MAJORITY OF THE BIOPSIES ARE DETERMINED TO BE BENIGN, CAUSING UNNECESSARY COST AND MORBIDITY. REFLECTANCE CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY (RCM) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE SKIN CANCER DIAGNOSIS WITHOUT A BIOPSY, BUT ITS IMPACT HAS BEEN CONFINED TO ~63 TERTIARY AND TEACHING HOSPITALS IN THE US. RCM IS THE ONLY FDA-CLEARED IMAGING METHOD THAT CAN NON-INVASIVELY EXAMINE CELLULAR DETAILS. IN 2017, RCM WAS GRANTED CPT REIMBURSEMENT CODES, WHICH IS INCENTIVIZING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO ADOPT RCM IN THEIR PRACTICES. HOWEVER, WIDESPREAD ADOPTION HAS NOT OCCURRED MAINLY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING WEAKNESSES: HIGH DEVICE COST (~$100,000), NON-PORTABILITY (CART-BASED), AND SLOW IMAGING SPEED (6-9 FRAMES/SEC (FPS), WHICH CAN PROLONG THE RCM IMAGING TO 15 MINUTES AND DISRUPT THE EXISTING CLINICAL WORKFLOW). OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A LOW-COST, PORTABLE RCM (PRCM) DEVICE AND MAKE NON-INVASIVE, RAPID SKIN CANCER DIAGNOSTICS ACCESSIBLE IN MOST CLINICAL SETTINGS. IN A PREVIOUS R21 PROJECT, DR.

IN 2019, ARGOSMD WAS FORMED TO COMMERCIALIZE THE PRCM TECHNOLOGY, AND SIGNED AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. OUR PROJECTED COMMERCIAL PRCM DEVICE WILL PROVIDE THREE UNIQUE STRENGTHS OVER THE CURRENT RCM: LOW DEVICE COST ($2,000), PORTABILITY (PEN-SIZED), AND FAST IMAGING (203 FPS). THESE STRENGTHS WILL ENABLE PRCM PENETRATE A WIDE RANGE OF CLINICAL SETTINGS (E.G., DERMATOLOGY, PRIMARY CARE, RURAL AND RETAIL CLINICS) AND ENABLE NON-INVASIVE, REAL-TIME DIAGNOSIS OF SKIN CANCERS IN THESE SETTINGS.

RADIATION RESPONSE AND RECURRENCE DETECTION - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CERVICAL CANCER IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CANCER DIAGNOSES AMONG WOMEN, AND TREATMENT FAILURE OF STANDARD OF CARE (SOC) CHEMORADIATION THERAPY (CRT) FOR LOCALLY ADVANCED CERVICAL CANCER (LACC) IS AS HIGH AS 30-50%. SINCE RECURRENT AND METASTATIC DISEASES ARE NOT CURABLE OR DETECTED TOO LATE TO BE TREATABLE, THERE IS A PRESSING NEED FOR PRE-TREATMENT BIOMARKERS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS AT RISK OF CRT TREATMENT FAILURE AND POST-TREATMENT BIOMARKERS TO DETECT LACC RECURRENCE AND METASTASIS EARLY. TCGA\u2019S EFFORT TO ESTABLISH PRE-TREATMENT BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER BY MOLECULAR STRATIFICATION USING HUMAN GENES FAILED TO ASSOCIATE TO PATIENT OUTCOMES. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED THAT HPV GENOTYPES AND HPV ALTERNATIVE SPLICING AFFECT LACC RECURRENCE AND SURVIVAL AFTER CRT. IN OUR PRELIMINARY DATA, WE ADDITIONALLY IDENTIFIED A DIVERSITY OF HPV GENOMIC STRUCTURES (HPV-GS), INCLUDING HPV-HUMAN GENE FUSIONS INVOLVING ALTERNATIVE SPLICED HPV EXONS, THAT AFFECT HUMAN ONCOGENE EXPRESSION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE VARIANCE OF HPV GENOMIC STRUCTURAL FEATURES AMONG LACC PATIENTS MAY REPRESENT A VALUABLE CLINICAL SEQUENCING APPLICATION TO DEVELOP LACC SOC CRT BIOMARKERS. FOR POST-TREATMENT MARKERS, WE CURRENTLY USE F-FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE PET/CT (FDG-PET) IMAGES AT 3\u20136 MONTHS TO DEFINE METABOLIC RESPONSE, WHICH WAS SHOWN IN OUR PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS TO PREDICT PATTERNS OF FAILURE AFTER RADIOTHERAPY FOR CERVICAL CANCER. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT HPV GENOMIC FEATURES CAN SERVE AS POST-TREATMENT BIOMARKERS FOR LACC RECURRENCE AND METASTASIS DETECTION THAT ARE BOTH MORE ACCURATE AND DETECTABLE AT EARLIER TIMEPOINTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE WILL FIRST TEST WHETHER VARIANCE IN HPV-GS CAN BE UTILIZED TO DEVELOP A CLINICAL PRE-TREATMENT BIOMARKER BY DEVELOPING A SERIES OF NOVEL HPV-GS ANALYSIS TOOLS BASED ON OUR EXPERTISE IN BOTH HPV GENOMICS AND HUMAN STRUCTURAL VARIANTS. HPV FEATURES WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM MATCHED DNA AND RNA SEQUENCING DATA, AND THEIR PROGNOSTIC VALUES WILL BE TESTED USING SAMPLES FROM OUR CERVICAL TUMOR BANK OF LACC PATIENTS UNIFORMLY TREATED WITH CURATIVE-INTENT CRT. SECOND, WE WILL EXAMINE WHETHER CRT-INDUCED LACC CLONAL EVOLUTION CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY TREATMENT-RESISTANT HPV-GS AS ON-TREATMENT BIOMARKERS. A NOVEL DEEP TARGETED SEQUENCING APPROACH WILL BE USED ON SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE VARIANTS (SNV) AND HPV-GS TO IDENTIFY LACC SUBCLONES AND FIT HPV-GS IN THE CONTEXT OF CLONAL EVOLUTION. WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE MECHANISMS OF HPV- HUMAN GENE FUSIONS USING CLONOGENIC SURVIVAL ASSAYS AND OTHER STANDARD ASSAYS. LAST, WE WILL USE OUR PROVEN HIGHLY-SENSITIVE AND FLEXIBLE CAPP-SEQ TECHNOLOGY TO EVALUATE WHETHER CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA (CTDNA) CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP HPV-GS TESTS FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND POST-CRT RECURRENCE DETECTION. WE EXPECT COMBINING BOTH SNVS AND HPV-GS WILL RESULT IN AN OPTIMIZED APPLICATION SUPERIOR TO USING SINGLE TYPES OF FEATURES ALONE. TAKEN TOGETHER, WE EXPECT OUR GENOMIC AND MECHANISTIC RESEARCH ON HPV-GS BIOMARKERS IN THE CONTEXT OF CRT- INDUCED LACC EVOLUTION WILL CREATE A SERIES OF OPTIMIZED PRE-TREATMENT AND RECURRENCE BIOMARKERS THAT CAN BE APPLIED IN THE CLINIC FOR PERSONALIZED ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT REGIMENS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e0af38c9-92a8-f2cb-a5b8-4b4f14f99689-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R37CA279596_7529"}, {"internal_id": 158296492, "Award ID": "R37CA278671", "Award Amount": 511558.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-04-10", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "CUSTOMIZED NANOFIBERS WITH PREFERENTIAL LUNG-TARGETING PROPERTIES FOR TREATING METASTATIC PULMONARY TUMORS - PROJECT SUMMARY  CURRENTLY, MOST NANOTECHNOLOGY CANCER THERAPIES FOCUS ON THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY TUMORS, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO LEVERAGE THE POTENTIAL OF NANOMEDICINE TO COMBAT CANCER SPREAD AT EACH STAGE OF THE METASTATIC PROCESS. LUNG METASTASIS IS A HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE, COMPLEX, AND HETEROGENEOUS DISEASE. THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR METASTATIC LUNG TUMORS AND CHEMOTHERAPY IS THE ONLY OPTION TO PROLONG PATIENTS\u2019 CLINICAL PROGNOSIS. ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES, INCLUDING TARGETED THERAPY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, BUT THEY FAILED TO SUCCESSFULLY TREAT METASTATIC LESIONS. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARD CURING LUNG METASTASES AND REDUCE PATIENTS\u2019 MORTALITY. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A NEW THERAPEUTIC APPROACH THAT CARRIES MORE DRUGS TO THE METASTATIC LUNG TUMORS AND RETAINS ON-SITE TO RELEASE A BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTITUMOR MEDICATION. IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO USE PEPTIDE-BASED NANOFIBER (PNFP6) WITH PREFERENTIAL LUNG-TARGETING PROPERTIES TO OVERCOME THE BARRIER OF SELECTIVE DRUG DELIVERY TO METASTASES. THE PNFP6 IS INNOVATIVE AS MULTIPLE NANOFIBERS CAN REARRANGE INTO A LARGE INTERFIBRIL NETWORK TO PROLONG THE LOCAL RETENTION AND OFFER A LONG-TERM TREATMENT. THE NANOFIBER TECHNOLOGY WILL BE COMBINED WITH IONIZING RADIATION THERAPY TO ENHANCE THE DRUG POST-DELIVERY ANTITUMOR EFFICACY. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE COMBINATORIAL THERAPY WILL COOPERATIVELY AND SYNERGISTICALLY INHIBIT THE DISEASE PROGRESSION LEADING TO AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF LUNG METASTASES. FOR PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE STUDIES, WE WILL USE PNFP6 TO CARRY AND DELIVER DOXOROBUCIN (DOX), A STANDARD CYTOTOXIC AGENT AND RADIOSENSITIZER. THE NANOFIBERS WILL FAVOR THE DRUG ACCUMULATION AND RETENTION ON-SITE WHILE RADIOTHERAPY WILL PROMOTE THE OVERALL ANTICANCER EFFECT THROUGH DIRECT TUMOR CELL KILLING AND RADIATION-MEDIATED IMMUNOGENICITY. THE SPATIOTEMPORAL-CONTROLLED DRUG RELEASE WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THE THERAPEUTIC SUCCESS. TO ESTABLISH THE POTENTIAL OF THIS ANTIMETASTATIC MULTIPLEXED APPROACH, TWO SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BE PURSUED: (1) EVALUATE THE LOCAL DRUG RELEASE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY; AND (2) DEFINE THE THERAPEUTIC AND SURVIVAL BENEFIT OF DOX-PNFP6 WHEN COMBINED WITH RADIATION THERAPY. TO ACHIEVE AIM 1, WE WILL SYNTHESIZE A PANEL OF DOX-LOADED PNFP6 ANALOGUES USING DIFFERENT CLEAVABLE LINKERS SENSITIVE TO TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT STIMULI TO RELEASE THE DRUG. WE WILL STUDY THE IN VIVO DRUG DELIVERY, RELEASE, AND TUMORAL UPTAKE USING LIGHT SHEET FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY AND MALDI-IMAGING. AND IDENTIFY THE OPTIMAL RELEASE MECHANISMS IN RESPONSE TO METASTATIC LUNG TUMORS. TO COMPLETE AIM 2, WE WILL ASSESS THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY (TUMOR INHIBITION AND SURVIVAL BENEFIT) AND TOXICITY PROFILE OF DOX-PNFP6 COMBINED WITH RADIATION THERAPY IN SEVERAL ANIMAL MODELS BEARING METASTATIC LUNG TUMORS. THE TREATMENT OUTCOMES WILL BE COMPARED TO FREE DOX AND DOXIL, THE FDA-APPROVED LIPOSOMAL FORMULATION OF DOX. WE WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE THE MOLECULAR AND IMMUNE PATHWAYS ACTIVATED BY THIS NEW THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENHANCED ANTICANCER ACTIVITY.

THIS STUDY IS GUIDED BY AN OVERARCHING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK DERIVED FROM MODELS OF THE SOCIAL/ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORIES OF BEHAVIORAL CHANGE, AND PRIOR EMPIRICAL FINDINGS. PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ASSESSED USING REAL-TIME, FIELD-BASED, STATE OF THE ART METHODOLOGIES CONSISTING OF MOTIONSENSE, ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT, AND GPS. MOTIONSENSE TRACK BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSIOLOGIC DATA IN REAL-TIME AND CAN OBJECTIVELY DETECT PA BEHAVIORS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT/STRESS OF PARTICIPANTS. GPS PERMITS REAL-TIME MAPPING OF AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S SPACE-TIME TRAJECTORIES AND RELEVANT ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES/CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., PROXIMITY TO PA FACILITIES; NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY) USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA. PRINCIPAL OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ARE PA ADOPTION AND PA MAINTENANCE. THIS RESEARCH WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SYSTEMATICALLY STUDY PA BEHAVIORS OF PACIFIC ISLANDER ADULTS AND THE FIRST TO COMBINE OBJECTIVE AND DYNAMIC INDICES OF PA, NEGATIVE AFFECT/STRESS, AND KEY ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES IN PA BEHAVIOR STUDIES. THE COMPREHENSIVE, MULTI-METHOD APPROACH IS A MAJOR ADVANCE FOR THE FIELD AS IT ELIMINATES PROBLEMS RELATED TO AN EXCLUSIVE RELIANCE ON SELF-REPORTS AND STATIC RESIDENTIAL LOCATIONS FOR KEY OUTCOMES AND PREDICTORS. IN ADDITION, THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES TO INCLUDE THE FRAMEWORK OF DYNAMIC PREDICTION MODELS, A NOVEL STATISTICAL APPROACH, TO FULLY EXAMINE THE HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA YIELDED BY REAL TIME ASSESSMENT APPROACHES.

AN EXTREME EXAMPLE IS MULTIPLE MYELOMA, A PLASMA CELL MALIGNANCY IN THE BONE MARROW, WHICH RESPONDS TO TREATMENT IN ALMOST ALL PATIENTS, BUT WHICH CANNOT BE CURED. MYELOMA PATIENTS THEREFORE RECEIVE MANY DIFFERENT LINES OF THERAPY DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR DISEASE. REPEATED BONE MARROW BIOPSIES ARE CRUCIAL FOR MONITORING OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND FOR INFORMING THE OPTIMAL CHOICE OF TREATMENT AND ARE THEREFORE CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED WITH ANY CHANGE IN TREATMENT. HOWEVER, THE EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF BIOPSIES OVER TIME CREATES AN ENORMOUS BURDEN FOR PATIENTS, AND THESE TISSUE BIOPSIES ARE OFTEN NOT PERFORMED BEYOND INITIAL DIAGNOSIS. IN ADDITION, BONE MARROW BIOPSIES ONLY CAPTURE MYELOMA CELLS FROM A SINGLE SITE, AND THEREFORE DO NOT PROVIDE A COMPLETE REPRESENTATION OF THE HETEROGENEITY AND ONGOING EVOLUTION OF THIS MULTIFOCAL DISEASE THAT IS CHARACTERIZED BY PATCHY BONE MARROW INVOLVEMENT. IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO DEVELOP NOVEL APPROACHES THAT ALLOW TO FREQUENTLY ASSESS MYELOMA EVOLUTION DURING THERAPY AND CHOOSE THOSE TREATMENTS THAT ARE MOST EFFICACIOUS. WE ARE PROPOSING TO USE NOVEL \u201cLIQUID BIOPSY\u201d APPROACHES TO REPLACE BONE MARROW BIOPSY BY INTERROGATING CIRCULATING MYELOMA CELLS AND CELL-FREE DNA IN MYELOMA PATIENTS, OBTAINED FROM A SIMPLE BLOOD DRAW. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT LIQUID BIOPSY PROVIDES MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND CLINICALLY RELEVANT INSIGHTS INTO THE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS AND GENOMIC EVOLUTION OF MYELOMA THAN CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH SINGLE-SITE BONE MARROW BIOPSIES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, WE HAVE PIONEERED TECHNOLOGIES FOR HIGHLY SENSITIVE ISOLATION AND DEEP MOLECULAR AND GENOMIC CHARACTERIZATION OF CIRCULATING MULTIPLE MYELOMA CELLS (CMMCS) WITH SINGLE CELL RESOLUTION, AS WELL AS WHOLE GENOME AND TARGETED SEQUENCING OF CELL-FREE DNA (CFDNA). WE WILL LEVERAGE THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO INFORM CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING IN A WAY THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF USING BONE MARROW BIOPSIES AS STANDARD-OF-CARE. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT: 1) LIQUID BIOPSY IS A BETTER PREDICTOR OF SURVIVAL THAN PARAMETERS CURRENTLY USED IN CLINICAL ROUTINE, 2) LIQUID BIOPSY HAS GREATER SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY TO DETECT ESTABLISHED PROGNOSTIC AND PREDICTIVE GENETIC DISEASE VARIANTS THAN BONE MARROW BIOPSY, THE CURRENT GOLD-STANDARD, 3) LIQUID BIOPSY PROVIDES A THERAPEUTICALLY MORE RELEVANT REPRESENTATION OF THE CLONAL COMPOSITION AND ACTIONABLE TREATMENT TARGETS OF MYELOMA THAN BONE MARROW BIOPSY, 4) LIQUID BIOPSY OUTPERFORMS BONE MARROW BIOPSY IN DETERMINING MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE (MRD) STATUS. IMPORTANTLY, REPLACING REPEATED INVASIVE BIOPSIES WITH LIQUID BIOPSY FROM A SIMPLE BLOOD DRAW WILL DRAMATICALLY REDUCE RISK AND DISCOMFORT FOR PATIENTS.

THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE LARGEST GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH BLADDER CANCER, THE 79% WITH NON-MUSCLE INVASIVE EARLY-STAGE CANCER. PER CURRENT GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS, THESE PATIENTS UNDERGO TRANSURETHRAL ENDOSCOPIC RESECTION FOLLOWED BY SURVEILLANCE CYSTOSCOPY EVERY 3 TO 6 MONTHS, MAKING CYSTOSCOPY COMMON WITH OVER A MILLION PROCEDURES PER YEAR.

GCTS ARE EMBRYONALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY VERY DISTINCT FROM OTHER SOLID MALIGNANCIES AND RETAIN MOST OF THE EMBRYONAL STEM CELLS CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING EXPRESSION OF A SPECIFIC SUBSET OF MIRNAS.

THE CT SCAN IMAGES DATA COLLECTED AT THE SAME TIME POINT OF MIR371 WILL BE COMPARED TO MIR371 EXPRESSION FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE PPV, NPV, SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY. THE ACCURACY OF THE TESTS INDIVIDUALLY OR COMBINED WILL BE ANALYZED TO DEFINE THE AUC OF THE ROC AND TO CREATE A PREDICTIVE MODEL OF AGCM THAT INTEGRATES CLINICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DATA. INNOVATION. THE INNOVATION OF THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL RESIDES NEITHER IN THE QUITE BASIC AND UNIVERSAL RT-PCR TECHNIQUE USED FOR THE MIR371 EXPRESSION, NOR IN THE SIMPLE STATISTIC AND STUDY DESIGN.

FURTHERMORE, STANDARD CLINICAL EVALUATIONS LACK SENSITIVITY TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE (MRD) THAT ULTIMATELY LEADS TO RECURRENCE. THUS, THERE IS A CRITICAL CHALLENGE AND AN UNMET NEED TO DEVELOP NEW PRECISION BIOMARKERS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WHO WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE A POOR RESPONSE TO THE HIGH-INTENSITY THERAPY AND MAY BENEFIT FROM ALTERNATE APPROACHES.

THE CEST CONTRAST DEPENDS ON THE CHEMICAL EXCHANGE RATE (KEX), WHICH IS PH SENSITIVE, AND THE VOLUME FRACTION OF THE EXCHANGEABLE PROTON POOL (FS) THAT IS SENSITIVE TO PROTEIN AND METABOLITE CONCENTRATIONS. THE SENSITIVITY OF CEST MRI TO PH AND PROTEIN/METABOLITE CONCENTRATIONS HAS PROVEN TO BE A POWERFUL TOOL FOR IMAGING A WIDE RANGE OF DISEASE PATHOLOGIES.

THIS WILL ENABLE ACCESS TO VOLUME RESTRICTED EARLY STAGE CANCER SAMPLES. THIS RESEARCH WILL GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NANOPARTICLE-BASED BIOMARKER PANEL FOR EARLY AND LATE STAGE PANCREATIC CANCER DETECTION AND WILL SUPPORT THE RATIONALE TO BRING NANOPARTICLE-BASED DIAGNOSTICS TO THE CLINICAL SETTING. PANCREATIC CYSTS ARE COINCIDENTLY DISCOVERED WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY AS THE USE OF HIGH RESOLUTION CT AND MRI IMAGING INCREASES, WITH UP TO 9.3% OF PATIENTS HAVING AN ASYMPTOMATIC CYST. AN INVASIVE ENDOSCOPIC ULTRASOUND GUIDED FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY (EUS/FNA) IS TRADITIONALLY USED TO DETERMINE IF THE CYST IS PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA (PDAC). THIS HAS A HIGH FINANCIAL COST AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH RISK WHERE 1/100 PATIENTS WILL DEVELOP ACUTE PANCREATITIS AND 1/10 OF THESE PATIENTS WILL DIE. CURRENTLY 60-76% OF PATIENTS THAT UNDERGO EUS/FNA DO NOT HAVE PANCREATIC CANCER. THIS SIGNIFIES THE UNMET CLINICAL NEED TO DEVELOP A BLOOD TEST TO STRATIFY PATIENTS WITH PANCREATIC CYSTS INTO CATEGORIES OF HIGH-PROBABILITY AND LOW-PROBABILITY FOR HAVING PDAC, WHERE HIGH-PROBABILITY WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE EUS/FNA. CURRENTLY, NO BLOOD BASED PDAC BIOMARKERS EXIST. TUMOR- DERIVED NANOPARTICLES OFFER A NEW SOURCE OF POTENTIAL PDAC RELATED BIOMARKERS. THE CHALLENGE IS THAT TRADITIONAL NANOPARTICLE RECOVERY METHODS FOR EACH NANOPARTICLE TYPE REQUIRE PLASMA VOLUMES THAT ARE TOO LARGE TO BE SUPPORTED WITH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE PDAC PATIENT PLASMA SAMPLES. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA NOW SUGGEST THAT HIGH CONDUCTANCE DIELECTROPHORESIS (DEP) TECHNIQUES CAN RECOVER SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF NANOPARTICLE DERIVED BIOMARKERS TO DETECT PRECANCEROUS LESIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERENTIATE EARLY AND LATE STAGE PDAC FROM CONTROLS AND REQUIRES ONLY 30 \u039cL OF PLASMA.

CURRENTLY, IMAGING-BASED DIAGNOSIS TAKES MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS OF SURVEILLANCE TO ASSESS BENIGNITY/MALIGNANCY WITH A MODERATE DEGREE OF ACCURACY. THE PERIODIC IMAGING EXAMINATIONS ALSO INCREASE THE BURDEN OF HEALTHCARE COSTS, DELAY RELEVANT TREATMENT, AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF METASTASIS.

IN BRIEF, MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS FOR PROMPT, DEFINITIVE DETECTION OF MALIGNANT SPN IS ABSENT BUT HIGHLY DESIRED. LIQUID BIOPSY OFFERS A METHOD OF PRECISION DIAGNOSIS, YET IT HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED IN SPN. EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES (EVS) ARE CELL RELEASED VESICLES OF SUB-MICROMETER DIAMETER. EVS CONTAIN A TISSUE-SPECIFIC SIGNATURE WHEREIN A VARIETY OF PROTEINS AND NUCLEIC ACIDS ARE SELECTIVELY PACKAGED. GROWING EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL ROLES AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF EVS IN CANCERS.

EVEN WITH THE MOST EFFECTIVE CHEMOTHERAPY (I.E., FOLFIRINOX), ONLY 30% OF PDAC PATIENTS RESPOND. THEREFORE, IDENTIFYING NOVEL THERAPIES IS AN URGENT AND UNMET NEED IN THE PDAC FIELD. ONE OF THE EMERGING STRATEGIES FOR TREATING THESE PATIENTS IS TARGETING TUMOR ARCHITECTURE. THE RATIONALE OF THESE THERAPIES IS TO TARGET TISSUE-SPECIFIC PROPERTIES, EITHER IN THE STROMA OR IN THE TUMOR COMPARTMENT, TO DISRUPT TUMOR TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS DURING DISEASE PROGRESSION OR IN RESPONSE TO TREATMENT (CHEMOTHERAPIES). THE MAJORITY OF THE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON TARGETING THE STROMA COMPARTMENT (CELLULAR OR EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PORTION), LEAVING THE TUMOR COMPARTMENT (E.G., TUMOR TISSUE-SPECIFIC PROPERTIES) A RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED TERRITORY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP BY IDENTIFYING TISSUE-SPECIFIC PROPERTIES IN THE TUMOR COMPARTMENT TO IMPAIR DISEASE PROGRESSION AND TO OVERCOME PDAC CHEMORESISTANCE. THE RATIONALE AND FEASIBILITY OF OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH STUDIES ARE SUPPORTED BY OUR RECENT PUBLISHED WORK (LIGORIO ET AL., CELL, 2019), IN WHICH WE SHOWED THE EXISTENCE OF 8 DIFFERENT TYPES OF TUMOR GLANDS, BASED ON THEIR INTERNAL COMPOSITION OF CELLS, WITH DISTINCT PROLIFERATION (PRO) AND METASTATIC (EMT) CAPABILITIES. MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT TUMOR GLANDS CAN BE CONSIDERED DISCRETE FUNCTIONAL \u201cUNITS\u201d WITH DISTINCT LEVELS OF AGGRESSIVENESS AND DIFFERENT CHEMOREFRACTORY BEHAVIORS. THEREFORE, OUR OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT TISSUE-SPECIFIC PROPERTIES EXIST THAT GOVERN TUMOR ARCHITECTURE BY REGULATING THE FORMATION, INTERNAL STRUCTURE, AND EVOLUTION OF TUMOR GLANDS DURING DISEASE PROGRESSION AND UNDER TREATMENT. TO TEST THIS CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS, WE HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED (I) A METHOD THAT ALLOWS US TO CHARACTERIZE THE CELL IDENTITY (I.E., DIFFERENT PRO AND EMT PHENOTYPES) WHILE PRESERVING ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATION WITHIN HUMAN TISSUE, AND (II) AN AD HOC MOUSE MODEL TO STUDY TUMOR GLAND-FORMING ABILITY USING A TIME-COURSE IN VIVO IMAGING TECHNIQUE (I.E., TWO-PHOTON MICROSCOPY). BY INTEGRATING THESE TWO METHODOLOGIES, WE (A) WILL CLARIFY THE FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR OF TUMOR GLANDS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR INTERNAL STRUCTURE (AIM.1), (B) WILL TARGET AN AGGRESSIVE SUBPOPULATION OF CANCER CELLS TO IMPAIR TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS (AIM.2), AND (C) WILL DEFINE THE ROLE OF TUMOR ARCHITECTURE IN PDAC CHEMORESISTANCE AND AS A POTENTIAL NOVEL BIOMARKER TO PREDICT THE RESPONSE TO FOLFIRINOX CHEMOTHERAPY (AIM.3). THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL UNCOVER NEW MECHANISMS (I.E., TUMOR TISSUE-SPECIFIC PROPERTIES) THAT DRIVE TUMOR PROGRESSION AND PDAC CHEMORESISTANCE WITH THE ULTIMATE INTENT (I) TO FIND NOVEL THERAPEUTIC AVENUES FOR PDAC PATIENTS, (II) TO DEFINE THE ROLE OF TUMOR ARCHITECTURE IN PDAC CHEMORESISTANCE, AND (III) DISCOVER NEW FOLFIRINOX-PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS TO IMPROVE THE DISMAL PROGNOSIS OF PDAC

9%. DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING CONTINUE TO RELY ON ENDOSCOPIC BIOPSY AND IMAGING, AND AS SUCH MOST PATIENTS ARE DIAGNOSED AT AN ADVANCED STAGE. SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC SCREENING TESTS FOR EARLY DISEASE REMAIN ELUSIVE. MOREOVER, WHILE CURATIVE-INTENT SURGERY IS AN OPTION FOR PATIENTS WHOSE DISEASE IS CONFINED TO THE PANCREAS, DISTINGUISHING PATIENTS WITH METASTASES WHO ARE UNLIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM SURGERY, REMAINS CHALLENGING DUE TO OCCULT METASTASES NOT DETECTABLE BY IMAGING. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, SEVERAL BLOOD-BASED LIQUID BIOPSY BIOMARKERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BUT SHOW LOW SENSITIVITY FOR DETECTION OF EARLY-STAGE DISEASE. WE HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN THAT CIRCULATING TUMOR DERIVED EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES(EVS) CAN BE ISOLATED FROM BLOOD AND THEIR RNA CARGO USED TO DIAGNOSE EARLY PANCREATIC CANCER AND STAGE DISEASE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF A NON-INVASIVE DIAGNOSTIC FOR PANCREATIC CANCER. HOWEVER, AS HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED, EVS ARE HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS IN THEIR EXPRESSION OF PROTEIN SURFACE MARKERS AND THEIR NUCLEIC ACID AND PROTEIN CARGO, AND ORIGINATE FROM MULTIPLE CELL TYPES IN THE TUMOR MICRO ENVIRONMENT (TME) (E.G. TUMOR CELLS, TUMOR ASSOCIATED MACROPHAGES). THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS A FUNDAMENTAL TECHNOLOGICAL UNMET NEED IN EV DIAGNOSTICS, BY FURTHER DEVELOPING OUR NEW APPROACH TO EV SUBPOPULATION ISOLATION USING MAGNETIC NANOPORES, WHICH COMBINES THE BENEFITS OF NANO-SCALE SORTING WITH SUFFICIENTLY FAST FLOW RATES (106X FASTER THAN TYPICAL NANOFLUIDIC APPROACHES) TO BE PRACTICAL FOR CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS.

CURRENTLY, THIS PROCESS CONSISTS OF BIOPSY, STANDARD HISTOLOGY, PHENOTYPE DETERMINATION VIA IM- MUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, AND INCREASINGLY, MOLECULAR ASSAYS. IN WELL-SERVED AREAS, THE CHALLENGES INVOLVE OBTAIN- ING APPROPRIATE AND REPRESENTATIVE BIOPSIES, WAITING FOR SLIDE PREPARATION, REVIEW BY A PATHOLOGIST, THEN IM- MUNOSTAINING (IHC), AND OPTIONALLY, SUBMISSION FOR NUCLEIC-ACID BASED STUDIES.

IN LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA AND MANY OTHER SOLID TUMOR TYPES, OPTIMAL TREATMENT RELIES ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC GENOMIC ALTERATIONS. THESE INCLUDE SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE VARIANTS AND SMALL INSERTIONS AND DELETIONS, AS WELL AS LARGER COPY NUMBER ALTERATIONS AND CHROMOSOMAL TRANSLOCATIONS. CURRENTLY, CLINICAL TESTING FOR THESE MUTATIONS REQUIRES MULTIPLE ASSAYS AND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TISSUE SO THAT BOTH DNA AND RNA CAN BE OBTAINED FOR ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, MANY SAMPLES FAIL OR SIMPLY CANNOT BE TESTED. AT OUR CANCER CENTER 38% OF LUNG CANCER PATIENT BIOPSIES SENT FOR COMPREHENSIVE MOLECULAR EVALUATION EITHER FAIL OR RESULT IN INCOMPLETE RESULTS. MORE ROBUST AND STREAMLINED DIAGNOSTIC METHODS ARE THEREFORE NEEDED TO PROVIDE TRULY COMPREHENSIVE MUTATIONAL PROFILING FOR ALL CANCER PATIENTS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NOVEL APPROACH FOR WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING (CHROMOSEQ) THAT PROVIDES RAPID, UNBIASED EVALUATION OF ALL MUTATION TYPES IN A SINGLE ASSAY. CHROMOSEQ LEVERAGES RECENT ADVANCES IN HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING METHODS TO DELIVER A COMPLETE GENOMIC PROFILE IN AS LITTLE AS 3 DAYS USING MINIMAL DNA INPUT. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SHOWN THAT CHROMOSEQ CAN PROVIDE RAPID COMPREHENSIVE GENOMIC PROFILES FROM BLOOD OR MARROW OF PATIENTS WITH MYELOID MALIGNANCIES AND THAT CHROMOSEQ HAS INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO DETECT CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT GENOMIC ALTERATIONS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL METHODS. HOWEVER, OBTAINING SIMILAR PERFORMANCE FROM SOLID TUMORS WITH LIMITED AMOUNTS OF DEGRADED DNA TYPICALLY OBTAINED FROM FORMALIN-FIXED PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED (FFPE) TISSUE BIOPSIES IS CHALLENGING. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT WITH SUBSTANTIAL METHODOLOGIC PRE-ANALYTIC IMPROVEMENTS AND RIGOROUS CLINICAL VALIDATION TESTING, CHROMOSEQ CAN ALSO BE USED FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE GENOMIC PROFILING OF SOLID TUMORS.

THE TWO PROMINENT TYPES OF ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY, ADOPTIVE T CELL THERAPY AND APC-BASED VACCINATION, BOTH REQUIRE EXPANSION OF ANTI-TUMOR T CELLS VIA APCS. HOWEVER, FOR THE PURPOSE OF EFFECTIVE ADOPTIVE T CELL THERAPY, THE CRITICAL QUESTION IS HOW TO GENERATE, WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, LARGE NUMBERS OF ANTITUMOR T CELLS. FURTHERMORE, IN VITRO-EXPANDED T CELLS MUST ALSO POSSESS THE CAPACITY TO ENGRAFT, PROLIFERATE, AND PERSIST IN VIVO WITH SUFFICIENT ANTITUMOR FUNCTION TO INDUCE SUSTAINED ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY.

THE NECESSITY TO ACCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF CANCER PATIENTS\u2019 BLOOD TO PREPARE AUTOLOGOUS APC FROM EACH PATIENT IN A TIMELY MANNER IS CUMBERSOME.

PROJECT SUMMARY MOST U.S. CHILDREN FALL SHORT OF THE RECOMMENDED 60 MINUTES OF DAILY MODERATE-TO-VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (MVPA). OUR RESEARCH AND THAT OF OTHERS SHOW THAT THIS GAP DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS CHILDREN WHO ARE FEMALE AND OVERWEIGHT/OBESE. PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO INCREASE CHILDREN'S PHYSICAL LITERACY (PL), DEFINED AS THE COMPETENCE, CONFIDENCE, AND MOTIVATION TO BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE FOR LIFE, HOLD PARTICULAR PROMISE FOR CLOSING THIS GAP AND ACHIEVING EQUITY. FURTHERMORE, POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS PROMOTE SCHOOL- AND HOME-BASED PA INTERVENTIONS, AND EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT INTERVENTIONS INCORPORATING BOTH SETTINGS MAY HAVE SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS. HOWEVER, NO PRIOR STUDIES HAVE TESTED THE EFFICACY OF A MULTILEVEL, PL-FOCUSED INTERVENTION. OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS FILL THIS GAP BY DESIGNING AND TESTING A PROGRAM THAT WILL REACH CHILDREN BOTH AT SCHOOL AND AT HOME TO INCREASE THEIR PL AND, IN TURN, TOTAL DAILY PA AND MVPA. WE WILL MEET THIS OBJECTIVE THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN TUFTS UNIVERSITY AND THE NEW YORK ROAD RUNNERS. THIS PARTNERSHIP IS A UNIQUE AND SIGNIFICANT STRENGTH GIVEN OUR ORGANIZATIONS' COLLECTIVE DISSEMINATION EXPERIENCE AND NETWORKS TO SCALE PA PROGRAMS NATIONWIDE. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES INCLUDE A FEASIBILITY TRIAL OF THE SCHOOL COMPONENT OF THE PHYSICAL LITERACY PROGRAM. THIS INFORMS OUR PROPOSED STUDY IN WHICH WE AIM TO FURTHER DEVELOP A FAMILY ENGAGEMENT COMPONENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY PILOT TEST THE MULTILEVEL PROGRAM: SUPPORTING PHYSICAL LITERACY AT SCHOOL AND HOME (SPLASH). THE SPLASH HOME COMPONENT WILL BE INFORMED BY FOCUS GROUPS WITH N=80 PARENTS IN NYC (N=40) AND GREATER BOSTON, MA (N=40). WE WILL THEN PILOT THE MULTILEVEL SPLASH PROGRAM TO EVALUATE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES AND OUTCOMES. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN N=8 NEW YORK CITY (NYC) SCHOOLS USING A MIXED- METHODS APPROACH. THE LEARNINGS FROM THE R21 PHASE WILL FURTHER INFORM THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPLASH PROGRAM DURING THE R33. IN THE R33 PHASE, WE WILL CONDUCT A GROUP RANDOMIZED TRIAL IN MA TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THE FULL, MULTILEVEL SPLASH PROGRAM ON CHILDREN'S PL AND TOTAL DAILY PA AND MVPA. WE PROPOSE TO ASSESS THESE OUTCOMES IN N=8 RANDOMLY SELECTED SCHOOLS (N=4 INTERVENTION, N=4 CONTROL, DELAYED INTERVENTION) USING A PRE-POST STUDY DESIGN WITH OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENT (ACCELEROMETRY) OF PA AND VALID, RELIABLE TOOLS FOR PL ASSESSMENT. WE WILL FURTHER EXAMINE WHETHER EFFECTS OF THE MULTILEVEL PROGRAM DIFFER BY CHILD SEX OR WEIGHT STATUS AND TEST WHETHER CHANGES IN PL MEDIATE CHANGES IN DAILY TOTAL PA VOLUME OR MVPA. THIS RANDOMIZED AND CONTROLLED STUDY WILL PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF A MULTILEVEL PL-FOCUSED PROGRAM ON CHILDREN'S PL AND PA.

CIRCULATING EXOSOMES IN NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER - SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT: THE EMERGENCE OF IMMUNE CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE (ICB) THERAPY HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE TREATMENT FOR ADVANCED CANCERS INCLUDING LUNG CANCER. PARTICULARLY, ANTI-PD-1/PD-L1 THERAPY SHOWS PROMISING THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES, AND SOME OF THESE THERAPIES ARE EMPLOYED AS THE FIRST LINE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC NSCLC. HOWEVER, NOT ALL PATIENTS BENEFIT FROM ICB AND SOME OF PATIENTS WHO INITIALLY RESPOND TO ICB DEVELOP ACQUIRED RESISTANCE AND SOMETIMES. MULTISYSTEM IMMUNE-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS. THUS, IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY AND PREDICT LUNG CANCER PATIENTS WHO WILL RESPOND TO ICB BEFORE AND DURING A COURSE OF TREATMENT. HERE, WE PROPOSE AN INNOVATIVE SCREENING STRATEGY AIMING AT EARLY PREDICTION AND REAL-TIME MONITORING OF RESPONDERS AND NON-RESPONDERS TO ICB FOR LUNG CANCER PATIENTS. THIS APPROACH IS BASED ON THE ISOLATION, DETECTION, AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CIRCULATING EXOSOMES SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANTICANCER IMMUNE RESPONSE RATHER THAN ANALYZING TOTAL POOL OF EXOSOMES. EXOSOMES ARE SECRETED NANO-SIZED PARTICLES CONTAINING NUCLEIC ACID, PROTEIN, AND LIPID CARGO SPECIFIC TO THE CELL OF ORIGIN, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED AS A MIRROR OF THE PARENTAL CELLS. BESIDES, THEY CAN BE EASILY EXTRACTED FROM BIOFLUIDS AS A SOURCE OF BIOMARKERS OF DISEASE STATUS AND TREATMENT RESPONSE. HEREIN, WE SEEK TO SPECIFICALLY ANALYZE TWO POPULATION OF CIRCULATING EXOSOMES INCLUDING TUMOR-DERIVED EXOSOMES (TEXS) AND PD-L1+ EXOSOMES THAT SERVE AS THE INVALUABLE DETERMINANTS OF THE STATUS OF TUMOR BURDEN AND ANTICANCER-IMMUNE ACTIVITY, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE FORMULATED TWO SPECIFIC AIMS THAT HINGE ON DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS: AIM1 WILL DEVELOP A HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SELECTIVE SENSING PLATFORM FOR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF TEXS AND PD-L1+ EXOSOMES FOLLOWED BY MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF TEXS TO EXPLORE THE MOLECULAR SIGNATURES ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT OUTCOME. FOR THAT, WE WILL GENETICALLY ENGINEER NOVEL BIOLUMINESCENCE-BASED PROBES BY FUSING BIOLUMINESCENCE PROTEINS WITH TUMOR-SPECIFIC AND PD-L1-SPECIFIC TARGETING MOLECULES, RESPECTIVELY. AIM 2 WILL EVALUATE CIRCULATING EXOSOMES FROM SERUM OF NSCLC PATIENTS TREATED WITH ICB THERAPY. THE PLATFORM DEVELOPED IN AIM 1 WILL BE USED FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF TEXS AND PD-L1+ EXOSOMES DURING THE TREATMENT, AND WHETHER THE OBSERVED CHANGES CAN BE UTILIZED AS A PREDICTIVE MARKER FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND MONITORING OF RESPONDERS AND NON-RESPONDERS TO ICB. THE CIRCULATING TEXS WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY ISOLATED; THEIR EXOSOMAL TRANSCRIPTS, AND LONG NON-CODING RNAS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY USING NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING TO EXPLORE THE MOLECULAR SIGNATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THERAPEUTIC OUTCOME. WE WILL APPLY COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES FOR DATA INTEGRATION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TEXS, EXPRESSION LEVEL OF EXOSOMAL PD-L1, MOLECULAR SIGNATURES OF TEXS, AND PATIENT\u2019S CLINICAL FEATURES.

THE CANCER SPREAD FROM THE PRIMARY BREAST TUMOR CAN OCCUR DURING THE EARLY STAGES, AND ALN METASTASIS IS USUALLY THE EARLIEST DETECTABLE CANCER SPREAD. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE (SLN) BIOPSY IS THE STANDARD APPROACH FOR AXILLARY STAGING IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH NO PALPABLE AXILLARY ADENOPATHY OR WHEN ALN METASTASIS IS NOT DETECTED DURING THE PRESURGICAL DIAGNOSIS. CURRENTLY, SLN IS IDENTIFIED BY A PERITUMORAL INJECTION OF A RADIOACTIVE TRACER, TECHNETIUM 99MTC AND/OR BLUE DYE, FOLLOWED BY A SLN BIOPSY FOR PATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION. ALTHOUGH THIS PERITUMORAL INJECTION METHOD CAN IDENTIFY THE LOCATION OF SLN, IT DOES NOT INTRAOPERATIVELY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LN METASTASES AND HEALTHY LN AS IT STAINS SLN REGARDLESS OF THE STATUS OF LN METASTASES. THUS, ONCE SLN IS IDENTIFIED BY 99MTC AND/OR BLUE DYE, SLN IS SURGICALLY REMOVED REGARDLESS OF CANCER METASTASES STATUS IN SLN, AND SENT FOR PATHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT. THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER (~70%) WHO UNDERGO A SLN BIOPSY ARE PATHOLOGICALLY NEGATIVE.

EMERGING CELL-BASED THERAPIES MAY GREATLY IMPROVE THERAPEUTIC SUCCESS OF CANCER TREATMENT. NK CELL IMMUNOTHERAPY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC CANCERS, WHERE INFORMATION ON TUMOR IMMUNOGENS IS LACKING. RECENTLY, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED INTEREST IN THE USE OF ADOPTIVE TRANSFER OF EX-VIVO EXPANDED NK CELLS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SOLID TUMORS DUE TO THEIR INNATE FEATURES, HIGHER SAFETY COMPARED TO T CELLS AND LOWER COST. THIS EMERGING THERAPY IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN OSTEOSARCOMA WHERE 30-35% OF PATIENTS DIE OF PULMONARY METASTASES DUE TO A TREATMENT-FAILURE RATE OF 85% IN THIS PATIENT GROUP. HOWEVER, AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF CELL THERAPIES IN THE CLINIC IS OUR INABILITY TO READILY ASSESS THE PRESENCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THERAPEUTIC CELLS AFTER ADMINISTRATION. VISUALIZATION OF IMMUNE CELL DISTRIBUTION AND MIGRATION WITH NON-INVASIVE IMAGING COULD OFFER SIGNIFICANT NEW INSIGHT INTO THE PROGRESSION OF IMMUNOTHERAPY BETWEEN INFUSION AND INVASIVE BIOPSY OR RESECTION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VIABLE APPROACHES FOR IMAGING OF IMMUNOTHERAPY, ALL CURRENT STRATEGIES HAVE LIMITATIONS AND NO TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVEN AS A SINGLE SOLUTION FOR LONGITUDINAL IMAGING OF CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPIES. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE PUSHING THE LIMITS OF AVAILABLE IMAGING TOOLS IN ORDER TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE PRESSING CLINICAL NEEDS. HYPERPOLARIZED (HP) 129XE MRI HAS RECENTLY EMERGED AS A PROMISING MODALITY FOR DIRECT IMAGING OF RESPIRATORY FUNCTION AND GAS ABSORPTION. SPECTRAL SEPARATION BETWEEN HP 129XE GAS IN THE AIRSPACE, TISSUE/PLASMA, AND RED BLOOD CELLS PERMITS QUANTIFICATION OF GAS ABSORPTION AND EXCHANGE. FURTHER, A FEW EXPLORATORY STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT CHEMICAL EXCHANGE SATURATION TRANSFER (CEST) OF HP 129XE IN PERFLUOROCARBON NANODROPLETS (PFC NDS) CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE SENSITIVITY TO THE PRESENCE OF PFC ND\u2019S DUE TO A STRONG CHEMICAL SHIFT BETWEEN 129XE GAS IN PFC AND WATER.

OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT LABELING OF NK CELLS WITH PFC NDS OPTIMIZED FOR 129XE HYPERCEST MRI WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR FUNCTIONALITY AND WILL ALLOW NON-INVASIVE NK CELL MONITORING WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY IN THE LUNGS.

THERE ARE NO CURATIVE TREATMENTS FOR PCA THAT HAS SPREAD TO DISTANT SITES AND THE 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE FOR METASTATIC DISEASE IS ONLY 30%. AS HIGH-GRADE PCA OFTEN LEADS TO POOR PROGNOSES, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THESE PATHOLOGIES AND IMPROVE PATIENT STRATIFICATION METHODS AS WELL AS THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT OPTIONS TO INCREASE PATIENT SURVIVAL. NONCODING RNAS ARE WIDELY MISEXPRESSED IN PCA PATIENTS AND ACT AS KEY TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES, PRO-ONCOGENIC FACTORS IN THE PROSTATE. NONCODING RNAS HARBOR A LARGE RANGE OF POST- TRANSCRIPTIONAL MODIFICATIONS (M6A, INOSINE, PSEUDOURIDINE, 2'-O-ME, A-TO-I EDITING, 3\u2019 URIDINE TAILING) THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR RNA MATURATION, FOLDING, EXPRESSION, AND NUCLEAR TRANSPORT. DYSREGULATION OF THESE POST- TRANSCRIPTIONAL MODIFICATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TUMOR GROWTH, INVASION, ANGIOGENESIS, IMMUNE RESPONSE AND DISEASE RECURRENCE. NONCODING RNAS WERE SERENDIPITOUSLY DISCOVERED TO CARRY GLYCOSYLATION MODIFICATIONS WHEN CULTURED HUMAN AND MOUSE CELLS WERE METABOLICALLY LABELED USING BIOORTHOGONAL CHEMISTRY METHODS NORMALLY EMPLOYED FOR GLYCOSYLATED PROTEIN AND LIPID ENRICHMENT. GLYCOSYLATION IS AN INTRICATE PROCESS THAT TYPICALLY INVOLVES THE COVALENT ATTACHMENT OF CARBOHYDRATES ONTO PROTEINS AND LIPIDS AS THE BIOMOLECULES MOVE THROUGH THE SECRETORY PATHWAY.

INTRAPERITONEAL CHEMOTHERAPY FOR MCP FACES TWO MAJOR CHALLENGES. FIRST, MCP IS CHARACTERIZED BY ABUNDANT EXTRACELLULAR MUCUS THAT FORMS A PROTECTIVE BARRIER AROUND CANCER CELLS, HINDERING IP CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUG DELIVERY. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED ROBUST MUCOLYSIS, IN PATIENT-DERIVED IN VITRO AND IN VIVO MODELS OF MCP, USING MUCOLYTIC DRUGS (E.G. BROMELAIN [BRO], N-ACETYLCYSTEINE [NAC] AND TRYPSIN [TRYP]). WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE BASELINE NET NEGATIVE CHARGE OF MUCUS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AFTER MUCOLYSIS (-POTENTIAL IN OUR STUDIES: UNDIGESTED MUCUS -1.93 MV; DIGESTED MUCUS -17.2 MV). SECOND, COMMONLY ADMINISTERED IP DRUGS FOR MCP (E.G. DOXORUBICIN [DOX] AND MITOMYCIN C [MITO]) ARE RAPIDLY ABSORBED ACROSS THE PERITONEAL MEMBRANE, RESULTING IN SHORT IP RETENTION TIME, LOW INTRA-TUMORAL (IT) PENETRATION, AND SYSTEMIC TOXICITY. THERAPEUTIC NANOPARTICLE FORMULATIONS HAVE LONGER IP RETENTION AND IT PENETRATION THAN FREE DRUGS BECAUSE OF ENHANCED PERMEABILITY AND RETENTION EFFECT AND PROVIDE PROTECTION FROM EARLY DEGRADATION AND PRE-ABSORPTION. THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO LEVERAGE NANOTECHNOLOGY AND THE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CHARGE OF MUCUS FOLLOWING MUCOLYSIS TO ENHANCE IP RETENTION, IT PENETRATION, AND DELIVERY OF POSITIVELY CHARGED ANTICANCER DRUGS IN MCP. TO THIS END, WE HAVE SYNTHESIZED MUCUS MODULATING MULTIPURPOSE TRYP NANOPARTICLES (MTN) COMPRISED OF THREE COMPONENTS; (A) A CORE OF NEGATIVELY CHARGED TRYP CLUSTERS, CONSISTING OF 4 ARMS OF POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL (PEG) AND TRYP, FOR ENZYMATIC MUCOLYSIS AND DRUG DELIVERY; (B) NANOPARTICLE-CONJUGATED NAC, FOR MUCUS DISRUPTION AND MUCOADHESION; AND (C) NANOPARTICLE-LOADED AND POSITIVELY-CHARGED MITOCHONDRIA-TARGETED ANTICANCER DRUGS (MITOCANS), SPECIFICALLY TRIPHENYL PHOSPHONIUM (TPP)- DOXORUBICIN (TPP-DOX) AND TPP-MITOMYCIN C (TPP-MITO), FOR ANTI-CANCER EFFECT. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT OUR MTN WILL DISRUPT THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF MUCUS, ENHANCE IP/IT RETENTION AND PENETRATION OF LOADED DRUGS, AND DELIVER POSITIVELY CHARGED TPP-DOX OR TPP-MITO ACROSS A PROGRESSIVELY HIGHER NEGATIVE CHARGE-GRADIENT FROM THE NANOPARTICLE SURFACE TO DIGESTED MUCUS TO MITOCHONDRIA (-POTENTIAL: DIGESTED MUCUS -17.2 MV; CELL MEMBRANES -30 TO -60 MV; MITOCHONDRIAL MEMBRANES -160 MV). OUR RESEARCH PROPOSAL PROVIDES A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY TO OVERCOME THE CYTOPROTECTIVE MUCUS BARRIER AND IMPROVE DRUG DELIVERY IN MCP. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE PROPOSED MTN WILL PROVIDE A PHARMACOKINETIC AND PHARMACODYNAMIC ADVANTAGE OVER NON- NANOCARRIER FORMULATIONS OF THE DRUGS.

WHILE ITS SENSITIVITY FOR METASTASES IS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF CT OR PET-CT, SMALL LESIONS (<5- MM) AND LEPTOMENINGEAL SPREAD MAY STILL BE MISSED, WHICH CAN HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON PROGNOSIS AND PLANNING FOR STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY, AS WELL AS ON THE USE OF TARGETED BIOLOGICS THAT CROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER. A METHOD THAT COULD FURTHER IMPROVE THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF MRI FOR BRAIN TUMORS WOULD BE OF GREAT CLINICAL BENEFIT. TOWARDS THIS END, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW CLASS OF PULSE SEQUENCES, CALLED T1 RELAXATION-ENHANCED STEADY-STATE (T1RESS), THAT GREATLY IMPROVES THE VISIBILITY OF TUMORS IN CONTRAST- ENHANCED MRI. COMPARED WITH EXISTING NEUROIMAGING TECHNIQUES, T1RESS AT LEAST DOUBLES THE TUMOR-TO- BACKGROUND CONTRAST WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING THE TUMOR-TO-BACKGROUND CONTRAST-TO-NOISE RATIO.

THE CHALLENGE WITH BC IS ITS HETEROGENEITY IN TERMS OF MOLECULAR ALTERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, STAGE I/II BC PATIENTS ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECTED TO MOLECULAR SUBTYPING USING EXPRESSION ANALYSIS OF A MRNA GENE PANEL, FOR EXAMPLE THE PAM50 PANEL. THE 4 MAJOR MOLECULAR SUBTYPES INCLUDE LUMINAL A, LUMINAL B, HER2- ENRICHED, AND BASAL-LIKE SUBTYPES WITH EACH ONE ASSOCIATED WITH A CERTAIN TREATMENT REGIMEN TO OPTIMIZE CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR THOSE PATIENTS. THESE TESTS ARE PERFORMED FROM A SOLID TISSUE BIOPSY TO SATISFY THE MASS REQUIREMENTS OF THE MOLECULAR SUBTYPING ASSAY (100 NG OF RNA). THE ASSAY TO DETERMINE THE MOLECULAR SUBTYPE OF THE BC PATIENTS USES REPORTER PROBES AND FLUORESCENT DYES TO PROVIDE HIGH MULTIPLEXING CAPABILITIES, BUT REQUIRES SINGLE-MOLECULE FLUORESCENCE READOUT OF MRNA/REPORTER PROBE ASSEMBLIES STRETCHED ON A GLASS SLIDE. LIQUID BIOPSY SAMPLES, FOR EXAMPLE EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES (EVS), ARE AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO SOLID-TISSUE BIOPSIES FOR MANAGING CANCER-RELATED DISEASES. THE ATTRACTIVE NATURE OF LIQUID BIOPSIES IS THE MINIMALLY INVASIVE NATURE OF THEIR ACQUISITION AND THAT THEY CAN REPORT ON THE STATUS OF THE PRIMARY TUMOR AS WELL AS METASTATIC SITES. HOWEVER, A CHALLENGE WITH LIQUID BIOPSY SAMPLES IS THE LIMITED MASS OF NUCLEIC ACID MATERIAL THEY SUPPLY. FOR EXAMPLE, 108 EVS SECURED FROM A STAGE I/II BC PATIENT WOULD PROVIDE ~1.5 NG OF MRNA. IN THIS R21 PROJECT, AN INNOVATIVE MRNA IDENTIFICATION/QUANTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY WILL BE GENERATED THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THE MASS LIMITS ASSOCIATED WITH LIQUID BIOPSY SAMPLES. THE TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS OF A DUAL IN-PLANE NANOPORE SENSOR COMPRISED OF MICROFLUIDIC AND NANOFLUIDIC STRUCTURES FABRICATED IN A PLASTIC, FOR EXAMPLE PMMA, USING REPLICATION-BASED TECHNIQUES SUCH AS INJECTION MOLDING. THE SENSOR CONSISTS OF PROPERLY ENGINEERED INPUT MICROSTRUCTURES TO ALLOW FOR HIGH SAMPLING EFFICIENCY TO PROVIDE AN EXQUISITE LIMIT-OF-DETECTION (<5 NG OF RNA).

OUR APPROACH RELIES ON IN VIVO FLOW CYTOMETRY (IVFC) ASSESSMENTS USING ENDOGENOUS AND EXOGENOUS SOURCES OF OPTICAL CONTRAST AND ITS OPTIMIZATION AND USE TO DETECT CAR-T/B CELL INTERACTIONS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO. THE PROPOSED METHOD RELIES ON THE CONFOCAL DETECTION OF ENDOGENOUS LIGHT SCATTERING AND FLUORESCENCE (LABEL-FREE OR LF) SIGNALS OF FLOWING CAR-T/B CELLS THAT ARE INTERACTING.

GVHD IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DONOR T CELL RECOGNITION OF RECIPIENT ALLOANTIGEN, PRESENTING COMMONLY IN SKIN, LIVER AND GASTROINTESTINAL (GI-GVHD).

EVS ARE IDEAL FOR LIQUID BIOPSY BECAUSE EVS ARE OFTEN MORE HIGHLY SECRETED BY CANCER CELLS THAN BY NORMAL CELLS, CAN BE DETECTED IN BODY FLUIDS OF CANCER PATIENTS, AND PROTECT THEIR CARGO FROM DEGRADATION. BECAUSE EV CARGO OFTEN REFLECTS THE GENETIC AND BIOLOGICAL STATUS OF THE CELL OF ORIGIN, CONSTITUENTS OF EV CARGO ARE PROMISING BIOMARKERS FOR CANCER DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS AND RECURRENCE. OF THESE CONSTITUENTS, MIRNAS HAVE ATTRACTED SUBSTANTIAL ATTENTION AS POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS. HOWEVER, SEVERAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF EVS DO NOT CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT MIRNA COPY NUMBERS. THESE STUDIES HAVE IMPLICATED THE EXISTENCE OF A SUBPOPULATION(S) OF EVS THAT IS ENRICHED IN MIRNAS, BUT THIS SUBPOPULATION HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED.

RAMAN MICROSCOPY IS OFTEN USED IN CANCER BIOLOGY TO IDENTIFY OCCURRING CHEMICAL CHANGES; HOWEVER, THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF DETECTION REMAIN TO BE A CHALLENGE. THIS GAP OF FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE INFORMATION CONTEXT OF SUCH IMAGES WILL BE ADDRESSED BY UTILIZING DEEP UV EXCITATION, WHICH, THROUGH RESONANCE EXCITATION OF SPECIFIC MOLECULES WILL ENHANCE SPECIFICITY OF MOLECULAR DETECTION AND IMPROVE THE SENSITIVITY BY ENHANCING THE SIGNAL AGAINST THE BACKGROUND. TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE IMAGE-BASED ANALYSIS AND SCREENING, A NOVEL HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE ANALYSIS PLATFORM WILL BE DEVELOPED.

FOR THIS REASON, EVERY YEAR, POOR PRE-ANALYTICAL SAMPLE HANDLING AND STORAGE GENERATE UNACCEPTABLY LARGE NUMBERS OF COSTLY FALSE LEADS IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. UNSURPRISINGLY, EXPERTS IN THE FIELD AGREE THAT THIS PROBLEM MUST BE MINIMIZED IMMEDIATELY.

THIS ASSAY WORKS VERY WELL BUT IT REQUIRES AN EXPENSIVE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPH-MASS SPECTROMETER (LC-MS) INSTRUMENT AND USER EXPERTISE TO RUN IT. THE NEED FOR LC-MS LIMITS ITS AVAILABILITY TO MOST BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH LABS WHICH FURTHER DIS-INCENTIVIZES ITS USE BEYOND THE LIMITED INCENTIVES THAT MOST INVESTIGATORS ALREADY HAVE TO CONDUCT QUALITY CONTROL (QC) ANALYSIS ON THEIR P/S SAMPLES.

GRIN LENS IS THE ONLY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE MICRO-OBJECTIVE, BUT IT HAS A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS NARROW WORKING SPECTRUM AND VERY SHORT WORKING DISTANCE. 3D PRINTING PROCESS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED RECENTLY TO PRINT POLYMER MICRO-OBJECTIVE WITH TWO-PHOTON POLYMERIZATION (TPP) PROCESS.

GLASS OPTICS IS PREFERRED FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION BECAUSE OF ITS EXCELLENT OPTICAL, CHEMICAL, AND THERMAL PROPERTIES. TO MEET THE INCREASING NEEDS OF HIGH-PRECISION GLASS MICRO-OPTICS FOR ENDOSCOPE AND ADDRESS THE MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT 3D PRINTING OPTICS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SOLVENT-FREE, PRE-CONDENSED LIQUID SILICA RESIN (LSR) AND TWO-PHOTON 3D PRINTING PROCESS FOR GLASS OPTICS. 3D PRINTING OF GLASS MICRO-OPTICS WITH ISOTROPIC SHRINKAGE, MICROMETER RESOLUTION, LOW DEVIATION PEAK-TO-VALLEY VALUE (<100 NM), AND LOW SURFACE ROUGHNESS (< 6 NM) HAS BEEN ACHIEVED.

IN SPITE OF THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THIS TUMOR TYPE, THE USE OF \u201cOLD\u201d DNA-DAMAGING CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS REMAINS THE FIRST OPTION FOR OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS. THE STANDARD TREATMENT OF HGSOC INVOLVES DE-BULKING SURGERY FOLLOWED BY PLATINUM-BASED CHEMOTHERAPY WITH THE AIM TO ELIMINATE ALL THE REMAINING MICRO-METASTASES. UNFORTUNATELY, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HGSOC PATIENTS DO NOT RESPOND OR ONLY PARTIALLY RESPOND TO THESE TREATMENTS. A PATIENT WHO DOES NOT RESPOND TO PLATINUM CHEMOTHERAPIES HAS TO GO THROUGH THE SAME TREATMENT AND EXPERIENCE THE TOXICITY WITHOUT MEANINGFUL BENEFIT. DESPITE THE RAPID ADVANCES IN CANCER GENOMICS AND PRECISION MEDICINE IN THE LAST DECADE, WHAT REMAINS SURPRISING IS THAT NO ROBUST MOLECULAR BIOMARKER THAT CAN FORETELL PATIENT RESPONSE TO PLATINUM AGENTS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IN OVARIAN CANCER, POINTING TO THE NEED FOR THE INCORPORATION OF FUNCTIONAL METRICS AND EARLY-STAGE MOLECULAR CHANGES INTO THE PREDICTIVE FRAMEWORK.

MUC16 IS OVEREXPRESSED ON OVARIAN CANCER CELLS AND BEARS THE CA125 EPITOPE THAT IS CURRENTLY DETECTED IN CLINICAL ASSAYS. THE VALUE OF CA125 TITERS FOR SURVEILLANCE IS AN ACTIVE AREA OF DEBATE WITHIN THE GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY COMMUNITY.

OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A NEW BIOMARKER FOR HGSOC RECURRENCE BY FUNDAMENTALLY RETHINKING MUC16. INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING MUC16 AS THE CARRIER OF THE CA125 EPITOPE, WE RECOGNIZE THAT MUC16 ITSELF IS PRESENT AS MULTIPLE DIVERSE PROTEOFORMS.

IN THIS R21, WE AIM TO DEVELOP NOVEL STRUCTURED METHODOLOGIES FOR SYSTEMATICALLY INCORPORATING FEATURE GROUPING STRATEGY FROM EXPERT DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE INTO THE TRAINING PROCEDURE OF DEEP-LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR IMPROVING PDAC DIAGNOSIS.

USING GENOME-WIDE ATAC-SEQ TO COMPREHENSIVELY ANALYZE TUMOR CELL-INTRINSIC CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY PATTERNS OF RESECTED PDAC, WE DISCOVERED A SIGNATURE OF 1092 CHROMATIN LOCI DISPLAYING DIFFERENTIAL ACCESSIBILITY BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH DISEASE FREE SURVIVAL (DFS) < 1 YEAR AND PATIENTS WITH DFS > 1 YEAR. BASED ON THIS SIGNATURE, WE DEVELOPED \u201cATAC-ARRAY\u201d \u2013 A NOVEL, CLINICALLY APPLICABLE MICROARRAY PLATFORM THAT READS CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY WITHOUT THE TIME AND COST ASSOCIATED WITH NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING. USING THIS NOVEL PLATFORM, WE DEVELOPED A CHROMATIN-BASED PROGNOSIS SCORE, DERIVED FROM THE ATAC-ARRAY RESULTS FROM OUR TRAINING SET SAMPLES, WHICH WAS FURTHER VALIDATED ON AN INDEPENDENT COHORT OF PDAC PATIENT-DERIVED 3D ORGANOIDS. BY ANALYZING OVER-REPRESENTED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR BINDING SITES AMONG CHROMATIN LOCI FOUND TO BE ACCESSIBLE IN PATIENTS WITH PROLONGED DFS, WE ALSO IDENTIFIED HNF1B AS A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR DISPLAYING DIFFERENTIAL NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH SHORT VS. LONG DFS. COMBINING THESE TWO SIMPLE METHODOLOGIES (I.E., THE ATAC-ARRAY \u201cPROGNOSIS SCORE\u201d AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL DETERMINATION OR HNF1B NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION), WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN ALGORITHM THAT AT THE TIME OF DIAGNOSIS STRATIFIES PDAC PATIENTS INTO PROGNOSTIC GROUPS WITH MORE THAN SEVEN-FOLD DIFFERENCES IN DFS. OUR STRATIFICATION ALGORITHM PROVIDES A SIMPLE AND CLINICALLY ACHIEVABLE PREDICTION OF FAVORABLE VS UNFAVORABLE EPIGENETIC STATES IN PDAC.

IN ADDITION, AFP IS NORMAL IN APPROXIMATELY 30-40% OF PATIENTS WITH HCC. BECAUSE OF THIS, HCC IS USUALLY DETECTED AT AN ADVANCED STAGE, WHEN THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS. THIS PROPOSAL IS BORN OUT OF CONVINCING PRELIMINARY DATA THAT INDICATE THAT DNA FROM TUMOR- DWELLING MICROBES CAN IDENTIFY MALIGNANCIES. APPROXIMATELY 2.5% OF READS IN THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS (TCGA) ARE MICROBIAL. MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS USING THESE MICROBIAL READS ACCURATELY IDENTIFIED SOLID TUMORS FROM EACH OTHER AND FROM ADJACENT CONTROL TISSUE. MOREOVER, MUCH OF THIS ACCURACY IS MAINTAINED WHEN BLOOD SAMPLES ARE USED INSTEAD OF THE TUMORS. THIS PRELIMINARY DATA IS PARTICULARLY ROBUST FOR HCC.  BASED ON THIS PRELIMINARY DATA, THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BIOMARKER FOR EARLY DETECTION OF HCC IN SEVERAL WAYS. FIRST, WE WILL USE THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED FROM TCGA ON A NEW COHORT OF SAMPLES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA LIVER BIOBANK. THIS BIOBANK HAS NEARLY AS MANY HCC SAMPLES AS THE ENTIRE TCGA NETWORK. SECOND, THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL USE MORE RIGOROUS CONTROLS THAN WHAT WAS AVAILABLE IN THE TCGA NETWORK. THIS INCLUDES THE USE OF NON-HCC LIVER MALIGNANCIES AND BENIGN TUMORS. WHEREAS THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS WERE ADEQUATE IN DISTINGUISHING HCC MASSES FROM OTHER PRIMARY TUMORS IN TCGA, IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY CAN DISTINGUISH HCCS FROM OTHER MALIGNANT AND BENIGN MASSES IN THE LIVER (E.G., METASTATIC COLORECTAL CANCER, HEPATOMAS), WHICH ARE MORE COMMON THAN HCC, OR THE BLOOD FROM PATIENTS WITH HCC TO THOSE FROM PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS WITHOUT HCC. FINALLY, THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL HELP DETERMINE WHETHER THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED FROM TCGA CAN DETECT WHETHER HCC HAS BEEN TREATED (E.G., CHEMOEMBOLIZATION) AND THUS POTENTIALLY SERVE AS A TOOL FOR SURVEILLANCE. OVERALL, THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL HELP DETERMINE HOW GENERALIZABLE THE ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED WITH TCGA ARE TO INDEPENDENT COHORTS OF HCC. THESE STUDIES WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFECTIVE SCREENING AND SURVEILLANCE PROTOCOLS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY IMPACT THE SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH HCC.

DESPITE THEIR PROMISE, SEVERAL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES EXIST DURING VACCINE PRODUCTION STEMMING FROM THE LOW AND VARIABLE DC-TUMOR FUSION EFFICIENCY. ONE CHALLENGE INVOLVES OBTAINING ADEQUATE TUMOR TISSUE, WHICH CAN RESTRICT VACCINE APPLICABILITY IN EARLY-STAGE TUMORS AND SOLID CANCERS. MORE SIGNIFICANTLY, LOW FUSION EFFICIENCY MEANS THAT MANY TUMOR CELLS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE VACCINE, WHICH MAY LIMIT THE NEOANTIGEN REPERTOIRE AND THE ULTIMATE EFFICACY OF THE VACCINE.

TO DATE, NONE OF THE CURRENT FDA-APPROVED TESTS HAVE BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED DUE TO LOW SENSITIVITIES (55%\u201370%) AND SPECIFICITIES (71%\u201383%). PERFORMANCE IS POOR FOR LOW-GRADE TUMORS DUE TO THE LOW ABUNDANCE OF ANEUPLOID CELLS AND HIGH LEVELS OF INTEROBSERVER VARIABILITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES IDENTIFIED SEVERAL RECURRENTLY MUTATED GENES OCCURRING IN 70-80% OF BOTH MUSCLE INVASIVE AND NON-MUSCLE INVASIVE BLADDER CANCERS (MIBC AND NMIBC, RESPECTIVELY). DETECTION OF THESE MUTATIONS COULD HELP IN EARLY CANCER DETECTION, INITIAL STRATIFICATION FOR TREATMENT OPTIONS, DETECTION OF MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE, OR IDENTIFICATION OF EMERGING CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE. AS WITH MOST OTHER SOLID CANCERS, ACCESSING TUMOR TISSUE EITHER BY BIOPSY OR SURGICAL RESECTION IS OFTEN LIMITED OR UNOBTAINABLE. FURTHERMORE, THESE CHARACTERISTICALLY SMALL SAMPLES ARE NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENTIRE TUMOR. FOR THIS REASON, TUMOR CELLS AND/OR DNA SHED INTO THE URINE HOLDS THE PROMISE OF YIELDING DETAILED GENETIC INFORMATION ABOUT A TUMOR USING A SIMPLE, NON-INVASIVE, URINE TEST. THE ADVENT OF NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS) HAS OPENED UP THE POSSIBILITY OF CLINICALLY EXPLOITING DNA AS A CANCER MONITORING ANALYTE.

MORE THAN 80% OF MM PATIENTS SUFFER FROM DESTRUCTIVE BONE LESIONS, LEADING TO SEVERE PAIN, PATHOLOGIC FRACTURES, MOBILITY ISSUES, AND NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS. MBD IS NOT ONLY A MAIN CAUSE OF DISABILITY AND MORBIDITY IN MM PATIENTS BUT ALSO DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE COST OF MANAGEMENT.

RAPID IMPROVEMENTS IN IMAGING TECHNOLOGY NOW ALLOW PHYSICIANS TO IDENTIFY EVER SMALLER OSTEOLYTIC LESIONS AND BONE MARROW ABNORMALITIES, HOWEVER THE CLINICAL VALUE OF ANATOMIC FINDINGS IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR.

OVER THE LAST DECADE, MULTI- PARAMETRIC PROSTATE MRI HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PCA.

TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS WE PROPOSE ESTABLISHING A LOW-FIELD, ROBUST, WIDELY ACCESSIBLE, AND THUS LOW- COST HIGH-PERFORMANCE MRI SYSTEM FOR PCA SCREENING.

ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS IS THAT ALTERED MECHANICAL PROPERTIES IS NOT JUST A SYMPTOM OF TUMORS, BUT CAN TRIGGER THE ACTUAL ONSET OF MALIGNANCY, AND PROMOTE TUMOR PROGRESSION. THE CLINICAL IMPACT OF CANCER MECHANICS RESEARCH, HOWEVER, IS CURRENTLY HAMPERED BY A LACK OF METHODS TO IMAGE THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT WITH MICROMETER RESOLUTION IN VIVO. CONSEQUENTLY, RESEARCH STUDIES ON THE ROLE OF EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX (ECM) MECHANICS IN CARCINOGENESIS HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED TO IN VITRO EXPERIMENTS OR EX VIVO MEASUREMENTS OF TISSUE BIOMECHANICS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A NEW IMAGING PLATFORM FOR TIME-LAPSE IN VIVO IMAGING STUDIES OF THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT. ACOUSTIC RADIATION FORCE (ARF) WILL BE UTILIZED FOR HIGHLY LOCALIZED \u2018PALPATION\u2019, AND ULTRA-PRECISE PHASE-SENSITIVE OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY (OCT) WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DETECT THE RESULTING NANOMETER-TO-MICROMETER SCALE DISPLACEMENTS. THE MAIN HYPOTHESIS, BASED ON A RECENT PAPER BY OUR GROUP, IS THAT THE USE OF HIGHLY LOCALIZED MECHANICAL EXCITATION (VIA \u2018PALPATION\u2019 WITH TIGHTLY-FOCUSED ULTRASOUND), COMBINED WITH MECHANICAL EXCITATION AT HIGHER FREQUENCIES IN THE KILOHERTZ REGIME, CAN BE LEVERAGED TO OVERCOME THE RESOLUTION LIMITATIONS OF SHEAR-WAVE-BASED APPROACHES, AND THEREBY ENABLE THE HIGHEST-RESOLUTION OCE IMAGING OF THE COMPLEX SHEAR MODULUS, I.E. BOTH SHEAR STORAGE AND LOSS MODULUS. A FURTHER HYPOTHESIS IS THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR APPROACH FOR AN EPI-ILLUMINATION IMAGING GEOMETRY WILL ENABLE THE DYNAMIC VARIATIONS IN LOCAL MECHANICAL PROPERTIES DURING TUMOR DEVELOPMENT IN VIVO TO BE QUANTIFIED. SPECIFIC AIM 1 WILL DEMONSTRATE OUR APPROACH FOR ULTRAHIGH-RESOLUTION ARF-OCE THAT COMBINES QUANTITATIVE SHEAR WAVE PROPAGATION METHODS WITH ULTRAHIGH-RESOLUTION AXIAL STRAIN IMAGING (THIS UTILIZES AN IMAGING SCHEME WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT DETECTS ARF-INDUCED DISPLACEMENTS AT THE SAME LOCATION OF A TIGHTLY-FOCUSED ULTRASOUND \u2018PALPATION\u2019 SPOT). OUR ULTRAHIGH-RESOLUTION QUANTITATIVE ARF-OCE APPROACH AND A NOVEL EPI-ILLUMINATION IMAGING SETUP SUITABLE FOR IN VIVO ARF-OCE STUDIES WILL BE VALIDATED IN SIDE-BY-SIDE AND TUMOR MIMICKING PHANTOMS BY COMPARISON TO AFM IMAGING OF MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OVER THE SAME EXCITATION FREQUENCY RANGE. SPECIFIC AIM 2 WILL APPLY OUR NOVEL ARF-OCE SYSTEM AND RECONSTRUCTION METHODS VALIDATED IN AIM 1 TO PERFORM IN VIVO IMAGING OF THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT. WE WILL DEMONSTRATE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, LONGITUDINAL OCE IMAGING OF THE SHEAR STORAGE AND LOSS MODULI OF THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT IN VIVO. THESE QUANTITATIVE OCE IMAGES WILL BE CORRELATED TO GOLD-STANDARD HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND SECOND-HARMONIC GENERATION (SHG) IMAGING OF RESECTED TUMOR TISSUES.

CURRENT IMAGING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS ULTRASOUND SONOGRAPHY, COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY AND POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY ARE EXPENSIVE, HAVE LIMITED RELIABILITY AND EXPOSE PATIENTS TO EXCESSIVE RADIATION. WE WILL HELP SATISFY THIS NEED BY CREATING A BENCH-TOP ASSAY FOR A KNOWN BIOMARKER FOR MANY B-CELL CANCERS THAT SHOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A KIT THAT MAY BE USED TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF THIS MARKER IN CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA (CTDNA). THE LEVELS OF THIS BIOMARKER, URACIL, ARE LOW IN THE GENOMES OF NORMAL HUMAN CELLS, BUT ARE GREATLY ELEVATED IN THE DNA OF A MAJORITY OF B-CELL LYMPHOMAS AND LEUKEMIAS. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO APPLY THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE DETECTION OF URACILS IN CTDNA IN BLOOD PLASMA OF B-CELL CANCER PATIENTS AS A TUMOR SURVEILLANCE TOOL.

THIS PROTEIN WILL BE FUSED TO A FLAG TAG AND A FLUORESCENT PROTEIN, AND USED TO DIRECTLY LABEL URACIL-CONTAINING DNA. THE FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL OF THE PROTEIN-DNA COMPLEX MAY BE ENHANCED FURTHER USING ANTI-FLAG ANTIBODIES CONJUGATED TO APPROPRIATE FLUORESCENT TAGS, THROUGH ELISA OR TYRAMIDE CHEMISTRY.

FURTHER, HAP IS A POTENTIAL NOVEL TARGET FOR THERAPY. FROM TUMOR DETECTION PERSPECTIVE, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT TUMOR EXTRACELLULAR HAP CAN BE DETECTED WITH RADIOLIGANDS THAT BIND TO HAP INCLUDING 18F-LABELED SODIUM FLUORIDE (18F-NAF) AND 99MTC-LABELED METHYL DIPHOSPHATE (99MTC-MDP), IMAGED BY POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) AND SINGLE PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTER TOMOGRAPHY (SPECT), RESPECTIVELY.

INDEED, MULTIPLATFORM ANALYSES OF POST-PD1/L1 INHIBITOR UC TUMOR HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED. THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS OF THIS STUDY IS THAT TUMOR, IMMUNE AND STROMAL MICROENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS DETERMINE RESISTANCE TO PD-1/L1 THERAPY MUC, AND THAT INTEGRATED BULK AND SINGLE CELL MOLECULAR DISSECTION OF POST-TREATMENT TUMORS WILL REVEAL THESE FEATURES. WE PROPOSE INNOVATIVE AND POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE MULTIPLATFORM LONGITUDINALLY OBTAINED BULK AND/OR SINGLE CELL (SC) ANALYSIS OF PRE AND POST PD1/L1 INHIBITOR TUMOR TISSUE AND PLASMA FROM MUSCLE INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (MIBC) AND MUC TO SHED DEEP INSIGHTS REGARDING TUMOR BIOLOGY AND RESISTANCE AND INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP NEW THERAPIES. WE WILL PERFORM DETAILED MULTIPLATFORM ANALYSES ON 2 SEPARATE COHORTS TOTALING 170 PATIENTS: 1) TUMOR TISSUE OBTAINED BEFORE AND AFTER PD1/L1 INHIBITOR EXPOSURE OR UNTREATED CONTROLS (N=130) AND 2) PLASMA CELL-FREE (CF)-DNA OBTAINED BEFORE AND AFTER PD1/L1 INHIBITOR EXPOSURE OR UNTREATED CONTROLS (N=40).

PATIENTS INCLUDED ARE FROM TRIALS THAT EVALUATED A PD1/L1 INHIBITOR (N=70) AS NEOADJUVANT THERAPY PRECEDING RC FOR MIBC, OR WHO RECEIVED A PD1/L1 INHIBITOR FOR MUC (N=50) AND CONTROL UNTREATED AND TEMPORALLY SEPARATED SERIAL FFPE TUMORS WITHOUT INTERVENING THERAPY (N=10). SCRNASEQ IS PERFORMED ON A SUBSET OF POST-PD1/L1 MUC TUMORS (N=20) TO ANALYZE TUMOR, STROMAL AND IMMUNE CELLS. WES IS PERFORMED FOR IMMUNOGENOMIC ANALYSES USING QUALITY-CONTROLLED PLASMA CFDNA OBTAINED BEFORE AND AFTER PD1/L1 INHIBITOR THERAPY OR CONTROL UNTREATED PATIENTS (N=40). THE FUNCTIONAL RELEVANCE OF SPECIFIC GENOMIC ALTERATIONS AND RESULTANT PREDICTED NEOANTIGENS IS STUDIED BY EXAMINING FUNCTIONAL IMMUNE AND STROMAL READOUTS, WHICH WILL SHED INSIGHTS REGARDING THE IMMUNOGENICITY OF GENOMIC ALTERATIONS THAT CAN THEN PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES. WE WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL INTEGRATED MODEL USING DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE STATIONARY SNAPSHOT OF THE MOLECULAR TUMOR, STROMAL AND IMMUNE PROFILES, AND THE TIME-BASED TRAJECTORY OF CLINICAL DATA TO COMPUTATIONALLY AGGREGATE HETEROGENEOUS DATA TYPES.

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

PATIENTS IN LMICS WOULD BENEFIT FROM LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY, AS ADVANTAGES INCLUDE: DECREASED PAIN, IMPROVED RECOVERY TIME, FEWER WOUND INFECTIONS, AND SHORTER HOSPITAL STAYS. LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY WOULD REDUCE RECOVERY TIME, ENABLING PATIENTS TO RETURN TO HOME AND WORK MORE QUICKLY, THEREBY MITIGATING IMPOVERISHING HEALTH EXPENDITURE. LAPAROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY CAN BE DEVELOPED THAT IS LOW-COST, DURABLE, AND DOES NOT REQUIRE A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF CONSUMABLE ITEMS OR ELECTRICITY.

GLOBALLY, APPROXIMATELY 570,000 WOMEN ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AND 311,000 WOMEN DIE FROM CERVICAL CANCER EACH YEAR. NEARLY 90 PERCENT OF CERVICAL CANCER DEATHS OCCUR IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS), DUE MAINLY TO CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE SCREENING PROGRAMS. LIKEWISE, CERVICAL CANCER RATES IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS IN THE US REMAIN HIGH. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY OF TEXAS, CERVICAL CANCER INCIDENCE RATES ARE 55% HIGHER THAN THE US AVERAGE, AND APPROXIMATELY 10% OF ELIGIBLE WOMEN ARE SCREENED. THERE IS BROAD CONSENSUS THAT HIGH-RISK HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HRHPV) TESTING IS THE BEST APPROACH TO IMPROVE GLOBAL SCREENING EFFORTS. AN HPV BIOMARKER THAT PROVIDES EXCELLENT SENSITIVITY AND BETTER SPECIFICITY THAN DNA IS HRHPV MRNA. HOWEVER, CURRENTLY AVAILABLE HRHPV MRNA TESTING REMAINS TOO COMPLEX AND COSTLY (E.G. >$45,000 FOR EQUIPMENT AND ROUGHLY $74 PER TEST) FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION INTO LOW-RESOURCE AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED SETTINGS. ADVANCES IN ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION AND LATERAL FLOW DETECTION OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A POINT-OF-CARE (POC) HRHPV MRNA TEST THAT IS ACCURATE, AFFORDABLE, AND CAN BE PERFORMED IN LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO COMBINE ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION AND LATERAL FLOW DETECTION WITHIN AN INTEGRATED POINT-OF- CARE DEVICE TO DRAMATICALLY LOWER THE COST OF HRHPV MRNA TESTING. WE WILL DEVELOP A LOW-COST, POC HRHPV E7 MRNA TEST THAT REQUIRES MINIMAL LABORATORY EQUIPMENT AND PERFORMS AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL RNA TESTS. ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION REDUCES THE INSTRUMENTATION COST AND COMPLEXITY TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION REQUIRING ONLY A SINGLE-TEMPERATURE HEATER.

METASTASIS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF CANCER-RELATED DEATHS, AND IS OFTEN MEDIATED BY DISSEMINATION OF CTCS VIA THE VASCULATURE. CTCS ARE THEREFORE OF GREAT INTEREST CLINICALLY AND IN BASIC CANCER RESEARCH. NEARLY ALL METHODS FOR THE STUDY OF CTCS RELY ON DRAWING AND ANALYZING SMALL (7.5 ML) BLOOD SAMPLES, WHICH IS BROADLY KNOWN AS \u2018LIQUID BIOPSY\u2019. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE RARITY OF CTCS ESTIMATION OF CTC NUMBERS FROM SMALL BLOOD SAMPLES IS EXTREMELY INACCURATE, AND RARE CELLS MAY ESCAPE DETECTION ENTIRELY. LIQUID BIOPSY IS ALSO INSENSITIVE TO NATURAL CHANGES IN CTC NUMBERS THAT OCCUR OVER SHORT TIME PERIODS.  OUR TEAM RECENTLY DEVELOPED NEW TECHNOLOGY, DIFFUSE IN VIVO FLOW CYTOMETRY (DIFC), TO DETECT RARE, FLUORESCENTLY-LABELED CTCS DIRECTLY IN VIVO IN SMALL ANIMALS. DIFC USES DIFFUSE LIGHT TO SAMPLE LARGE CIRCULATING BLOOD VOLUMES IN BULK TISSUE. THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF DIFC IS THEREFORE SENSITIVITY: WE SHOWED THAT DIFC CAN ACCURATELY DETECT FEWER THAN 1 CTC PER ML OF PB. BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REQUIRE BLOOD DRAWS, DIFC ALSO ALLOWS LONGITUDINAL STUDIES IN INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS. DIFC IS ALSO READILY SCALABLE TO LARGER LIMBS, SPECIES, AND POTENTIALLY EVEN TO HUMANS.  HOWEVER, USE OF DIFC IN HUMANS WOULD REQUIRE BRIGHT AND SPECIFIC FLUORESCENT LABELING OF TARGET CTCS IN VIVO. FORTUNATELY, THERE HAS BEEN MAJOR TECHNICAL AND REGULATORY PROGRESS IN INJECTABLE MOLECULAR TRACER TECHNOLOGY FOR FLUORESCENCE GUIDED SURGERY OF CANCER. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST FOR THIS PROPOSAL, OTL38 IS A NEAR-INFRARED (NIR) SMALL-MOLECULE FOLATE-RECEPTOR (FR)-TARGETED PROBE THAT IS IN PHASE-III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR OVARIAN AND LIVER CANCER. OTL38 HAS HIGH SPECIFICITY AND AFFINITY FOR CTCS IN BLOOD, WITH LOW NON-SPECIFIC UPTAKE BY OTHER BLOOD CELLS OR VESSEL WALLS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE NIR LIGHT EXPERIENCES MINIMAL LIGHT ATTENUATION THROUGH BIOLOGICAL TISSUE, OTL38 IS SUITABLE FOR DETECTION FROM DEEPER-SEATED BLOOD VESSELS.  THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR \u2018FLUORESCENCE MOLECULAR IN VIVO LIQUID BIOPSY OF CTCS\u2019. IN AIM 1, WE WILL BUILD AN H-DIFC SYSTEM FOR USE IN THE HUMAN WRIST OR FOREARM, WHERE ARTERIAL FLOW RATES ARE 100S OF ML PER MINUTE. IN AIM 2, WE WILL VALIDATE LABELING OF FR+ CTCS WITH OTL38, AND DETECTABILITY WITH H-DIFC IN AN ARM-MIMICKING FLOW PHANTOM MODEL IN VITRO. WE WILL QUANTIFY SPECIFICITY, BRIGHTNESS, AND EXTERNAL DETECTABILITY UP TO 4 MM DEEP IN TISSUE. IN AIM 3, WE WILL TEST OTL38 AND H-DIFC IN A MOUSE METASTASIS MODEL AND IN HAIRLESS GUINEA PIGS (WHICH HAVE SIMILAR OPTICAL PROPERTIES TO HUMAN SKIN) IN VIVO.  IF SUCCESSFUL, H-DIFC WOULD ALLOW SENSITIVE AND ACCURATE ENUMERATION OF CTCS CONTINUOUSLY WITHOUT DRAWING BLOOD SAMPLES. THIS WOULD REPRESENT A COMPLETELY NEW DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR STAGING, MANAGING, AND STUDYING METASTASIS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF MALIGNANCIES. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OTL38 (AND OTHER FLUORESCENT TRACERS) ARE ALREADY IN ADVANCED CLINICAL TRIALS, THERE WOULD BE A RAPID PATHWAY TO FIRST-IN-HUMAN TESTING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA",

NANOMETER-SIZED LIPID PARTICLES CONTAINING PROTEIN AND NUCLEIC ACID CARGOES (INFORMATION)\u00beARE HIGHLY PROMISING FOR NEW DIAGNOSTICS/PROGNOSTICS AND EVEN HAVE THERAPEUTIC VALUE. THERE IS, HOWEVER, AN UNMET NEED FOR METHODS ABLE TO SOLVE A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM CONFOUNDING THE EXPLOITATION OF EV INFORMATION IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE\u00beEVS ARE NATURALLY HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS PARTICLES. IN THIS PILOT (R21) PROJECT, OUR EXPERIMENTAL GOAL IS TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR ANALYZING EV HETEROGENEITY (SUBPOPULATIONS) BY FOCUSING ON PARTICLES CALLED EXOSOMES. SPECIFICALLY, OUR NEW TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF RESOLVING BULK EXOSOMAL SUBPOPULATIONS BY DIRECTLY CORRELATING SURFACE PROTEIN AND NUCLEIC ACID (MICRORNA OR MIRNA) CARGOES OF SINGLE EXOSOMES BY PERFORMING HIGHLY MULTIPLEXED FLUORESCENCE IMAGING ANALYSIS. OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A UNIQUE IMAGING PLATFORM FOR THE HIGH-THROUGHPUT, HIGH-CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE PROTEIN AND NUCLEIC ACID CARGOES OF SINGLE EXOSOMES (AND OTHER EVS) OBTAINED FROM ANY BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE. THIS NEW PLATFORM COULD ENABLE NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC/PROGNOSTIC \u201cLIQUID BIOPSY\u201d TESTS FOR MANAGING CANCERS AS WELL AS OTHER PATHOLOGIES, SUCH AS NEURODEGENERATIVE AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES.  TO ACHIEVE OUR EXPERIMENTAL GOAL, IN THE WORK FOR AIMS 1 AND 2 WE WILL DEVELOP AND OPTIMIZE OUR IMAGING PLATFORM FOR EXPERIMENTAL MULTIPLEXED ANALYSIS OF HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELL EXOSOMES AND THEIR MIRNA CARGOES. THESE AIMS WILL VALIDATE OUR PLATFORM FOR IN SITU MIRNA ANALYSIS OF SINGLE EXOSOMES FROM CANCER CELLS WITH DOCUMENTED EXOSOMAL MIRNA SIGNATURES. DURING AIM 3, WE WILL USE THE VALIDATED PLATFORM TO CORRELATE THE SURFACE PROTEIN DISPLAY AND MIRNA CARGO OF INDIVIDUAL EXOSOMES RELEASED BY HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELL LINES REPRESENTING EARLY- AND LATE-STAGE CANCERS AND COMPARE THESE WITH A NORMAL CELL LINE CONTROL. AIM 3 WILL TEST THE CAPABILITY OF OUR PLATFORM TO RESOLVE EXOSOMAL SUBPOPULATIONS IN AN ORIGINAL BULK SAMPLE, BASED ON CORRELATED SIGNALS FOR SURFACE PROTEINS AND MIRNA CARGOES OF SINGLE EXOSOMES.  WE PROPOSE THAT OUR NOVEL IMAGING PLATFORM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A NEW DIAGNOSTIC/PROGNOSTIC TOOL FOR THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF BREAST CANCER, OTHER TUMOR TYPES, AND OTHER PATHOLOGIES IN WHICH EV/EXOSOMAL ANALYSIS COULD PROVIDE CLINICALLY USEFUL INFORMATION. RECENT RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT BREAST-CANCER-CELL- DERIVED EXOSOMES CAN TRANSPORT CARGOES THAT PROMOTE ONCOGENIC OR MALIGNANT PHENOTYPES. THUS, EXOSOMES RELEASED FROM BREAST TUMORS COULD CARRY INFORMATION WITH CRITICAL DIAGNOSTIC/PROGNOSTIC VALUE, WHICH COULD BE SAMPLED FROM BLOOD OR OTHER PATIENT FLUIDS (A \u201cLIQUID BIOPSY\u201d).

THESE PREDETERMINED MICROENVIRONMENTS, TERMED \u2018PRE-METASTATIC NICHES\u2019, ENCOURAGE THE OUTGROWTH OF THE INCOMING CANCER CELLS AND MAKE METASTASIS SUCESSFUL. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TUMORS SEND EXOSOMES WITH DISTINCT INTEGRINS TO PREPARE PRE-METASTATIC NICHES IN DISTANT ORGANS, WITH 64 AND 61 ASSOCIATED WITH LUNG METASTASIS, V5 ASSOCIATED WITH LIVER METASTASIS, AND IIB3 WITH BRAIN METASTASIS (HOSHINO ET AL., NATURE 2015, 527, 329). THESE FINDINGS POINT TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE INTEGRIN PROFILES OF PLASMA EXOSOMES FROM CANCER PATIENTS COULD BE USED TO PREDICT METASTASIS AND ORGANOTROPIC DISSEMINATION. TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THIS KNOWLEDGE CAN BE PUT TO PRACTICE USE, FURTHER EVALUATION IS REQUIRED. TO EVALUATE EXOSOMAL BIOMARKERS IN CLINICAL SAMPLES AND USE IT IN THE CLINICAL SETTINGS, FACILE BUT HIGH SENSITIVITY AND HIGH SPECIFICITY TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEEDED BUT CURRENTLY LACKING. THIS IS BECAUSE EXOSOMES ARE SMALL (LOWER THAN 200 NM) AND THE TUMOR-DERIVED EXOSOMES ARE MIXED WITH A VAST BACKGROUND OF NON-TUMOR EXOSOMES FROM VARIOUS TISSUES AND HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS, WHICH MAKES QUANTITATIVE DETECTION OF EXOSOMAL BIOMARKERS IN CLINICAL SAMPLES CHALLENGING.  THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO VALIDATE AND EXTEND THE DEPTH OF EXOSOMAL INTEGRINS FOR METASTASIS PREDICTION BY PROVIDING SINGLE EXOSOME LANDSCAPES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY LUMPED INTO BULK ASSAYS. WE PROPOSE A FACILE DUAL IMAGING SINGLE VESICLE TECHNOLOGY (DISVT) THAT IS CAPABLE OF DETECTING TARGETED SURFACE PROTEIN MARKERS ON INDIVIDUAL EXOSOMES AND QUANTIFYING THE TARGET-SPECIFIC VESICLE SUBTYPES IN PLASMA SAMPLES. THE DISVT CAPTURES EXOSOMES DIRECTLY FROM DILUTED PLASMA ONTO A MULTI-WELL GOLD CHAMBER SLIDE, LOCALIZE THE INDIVIDUAL EXOSOMES WITH MEMBRANE DYE AND LASER EXCITED FLUORESCENCE IMAGING, AND DETECT SURFACE PROTEINS OF INTERESTS USING LIGHT SCATTERING GOLD NANOPARTICLES AND DARK FIELD IMAGING AT SINGLE PARTICLE LEVEL. USING HUMAN EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR 2 (HER2)-POSITIVE BREAST CANCER AS THE DISEASE MODEL, OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS DISVT, BUT NOT TRADITIONAL ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY, CAN DETECT BC AT EARLY-STAGE, OPENING THE POSSIBILITIES TO PROBE AND QUANTIFY EXOSOMAL BIOMARKERS AT SINGLE VESICLE LEVEL FOR CLINICAL USE.  USING DISVT, WE PROPOSE TO QUANTITATIVELY CHARACTERIZE INTEGRIN-CARRYING EXOSOMES IN PLASMA SAMPLES FROM LOCALLY-ADVANCED BC PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED METASTATIC RECURRENCE WITHIN THREE TO FIVE YEARS OF DIAGNOSIS AND COMPARE WITH A GROUP OF PATIENT CONTROLS AND HEALTHY CONTROL. WE WILL CHARACTERIZE EIGHT INTEGRIN MARKERS BASED ON THEIR POTENTIAL FOR ORGANOTROPIC METASTASIS PREDICTION. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS PROJECT WILL 1) LEAD TO A FACILE AND ROBUST SVT THAT CAN BE USED FOR BASIC VESICLE RESEARCH AND CLINICAL USE, AND 2) LARGELY EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CLINICAL VALUE OF EXOSOMAL INTEGRINS FOR THE PREDICTION OF BC METASTASIS AND ORGANOTROPISM BY PROVIDING A MAP OF SINGLE EXOSOME INTEGRIN PROFILES FOR LOCALLY-ADVANCED, ADVANCED, AND EARLY-STAGE PATIENTS.

HOWEVER, EXISTING STUDIES HAVE DESCRIBED THE SHAPE OF TUMORS IN A LIMITED SCOPE.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP TOPOLOGICAL TUMOR SHAPE REPRESENTATIONS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDI- CAL IMAGES AND PROVIDE MODEL-BASED APPROACHES BASED ON THE TOPOLOGICAL IMAGE FEATURES. OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TOPOLOGICAL FEATURES OF MEDICAL IMAGES CAPTURE SHAPES AND PATTERNS OF TUMOR REGIONS AND PREDICT PROG- NOSIS AND SURVIVAL AFTER CONTROLLING KEY CLINICAL PARAMETERS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL FURTHER DEVELOP TOPOLOGY-BASED TUMOR ANALYSIS METHODS FOR PATHOLOGY AND RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGES AND PROVIDE TOOLS TO AID MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING.

IN 2021, THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY ESTIMATED THAT 284,200 NEW CASES OF BREAST CANCER (BC) WERE DIAGNOSED FOR BOTH WOMEN (281,550) AND MEN (2,650), WITH AN ESTIMATED DEATH OF 43,600 WOMEN AND 530 MEN. TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER (TNBC) IS A SUBTYPE OF BC ASSOCIATED WITH YOUNGER AGE, AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC ETHNICITY BACKGROUND, AND BRCA GENE-MUTATED POPULATIONS. TNBC LACKS EXPRESSIONS OF ER/PR/HER2 AND MEANINGFUL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS, PATIENTS WITH TNBC ARE TREATED WITH CONVENTIONAL CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPY. TNBC IS CHARACTERIZED BY INTRA-TUMOR HETEROGENEITIES, HIGH PROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY, POOR PROGNOSIS, HIGH RISK OF RELAPSE, AND METASTASIS TO LUNGS AND BRAIN. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH EARLY-STAGE TNBC EXPERIENCE RECURRENCE, AND 37% DIE WITHIN THE FIRST 5 YEARS AFTER SURGERY. THEREFORE, NOVEL THERAPEUTIC ALTERNATIVES TO OVERCOME RESISTANCE TO CHEMOTHERAPY AND TO PREVENT RECURRENCE AND METASTASIS ARE ESSENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE CLINICAL CARE OF THIS DEADLY DISEASE. THE REMARKABLE FEATURES OF THERAPEUTIC NUCLEIC ACIDS (TNAS) AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY (PDT) SUCH AS LOW SIDE-EFFECTS, TARGETING DIFFERENT CELLULAR DEATH MECHANISMS, AND POTENTIAL IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECTS MAKE THESE TREATMENT MODALITIES A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE FOR THE TREATMENT OF TNBC.

COMPARED TO MAMMOGRAPHY, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) DETECTS MORE BREAST CANCERS BUT STILL SUFFERS FROM HIGH FALSE POSITIVE RATES DUE TO THE CONVENTIONAL CONTRAST AGENTS USED, E.G., GADOLINIUM (GD)-CHELATES. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL, SAFE CONTRAST AGENTS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER THAT REDUCE THE FALSE POSITIVES AND FALSE NEGATIVES OF BREAST MRI. THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF GD-CHELATES RESULTS FROM THEIR LACK OF TARGETING AND CONSTANT MRI SIGNAL. BY REMAINING ACTIVE, GD-CHELATES PRODUCE HIGH BACKGROUND SIGNAL IN NORMAL TISSUES AND HIGHLIGHT BOTH BENIGN AND MALIGNANT TUMORS. TO ADDRESS OUR LONG-TERM GOAL, WE HAVE DEVELOPED NANO-, ENCAPSULATED MANGANESE OXIDE (NEMO) PARTICLES THAT WILL PROVIDE SUPERIOR REPLACEMENTS FOR GD-CHELATES. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS THAT NEMO PARTICLE SPECIFICITY IS ACHIEVED BY ADDING PEPTIDE TARGETING TO UNDERGLYCOSYLATED MUCIN-1, WHICH IS OVEREXPRESSED EXCLUSIVELY ON BREAST CANCER CELLS. NEMO PARTICLES PROVIDE A UNIQUE PH-SWITCHABLE SIGNAL THAT IS ONLY ACTIVATED UPON INTERNALIZATION IN ACIDIC TUMOR CELL ENDOSOMES (PH 5). NO MRI SIGNAL IS PRODUCED AT PH OF THE BLOOD (PH 7.4) OR TUMOR EXTRACELLULAR SPACE (PH 6.5).

OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT NEMO PARTICLES WILL ELICIT LOW TOXICITY, SPECIFICALLY LABEL BREAST CANCER CELLS, AND YIELD HIGHER MRI CONTRAST COMPARED TO GD-CHELATES IN 3D MICROFLUIDIC TUMOR MODELS AND IN MICE WITH BREAST CANCER. OUR HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED WITH TWO AIMS: 1) EVALUATE NEMO PARTICLE VS. GD-CHELATE MRI CONTRAST IN 3D MICROFLUIDIC TUMOR MODELS AND MICE. 2) EVALUATE TOXICITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF NEMO PARTICLES IN 3D MICROFLUIDIC TUMOR MODELS AND MICE. THIS PROJECT IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE NEMO PARTICLES UNIQUELY RESPOND TO ENDOSOMAL PH TO GENERATE CONTRAST ONLY INSIDE BREAST CANCER CELLS TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE BINARY READOUT (BENIGN \u201cOFF\u201d, MALIGNANCY \u201cON\u201d).

FLUORESCENCE FROM INTRAOPERATIVE MOLECULAR PROBES ENABLES SURGEONS TO VISUALIZE TUMOR TISSUES IN REAL TIME AND PERFORM FLUORESCENCE-GUIDED RESECTION (FGR). IT HAS BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED THAT FGR LEADS TO MORE COMPLETE TUMOR RESECTION AND BETTER SURGICAL OUTCOMES THAN CONVENTIONAL SURGERY UNDER WHITE LIGHT. AMINOLEVULINIC ACID (ALA) IS ONE OF A FEW FDA-APPROVED INTRAOPERATIVE FLUORESCENT PROBES AND THE ONLY MOLECULAR PROBE BASED ON THE METABOLIC ALTERATIONS IN TUMOR CELLS.

TO TEST OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS, WE HEREBY PRESENT A THREE-YEAR RESEARCH PROJECT COMPOSED OF TWO SPECIFIC AIMS. IN AIM 1, WE WISH TO ENGINEER AND EVALUATE NIR-ACTIVATABLE AMPLS, AND THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT CONJUGATION OF AMPLS WITH NIR DYES ENABLES PHOTOACTIVATION BY NIR IRRADIATION TOWARDS ELIMINATION OF OVARIAN CSCS. IN AIM 2, WE WILL VALIDATE THE CD36-DEPEDENT DRUG ACCUMULATION AND EFFICACY OF AMPLS, AND OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AMPLS HARNESS CD36 TO FACILITATE THEIR DRUG ACCUMULATION TO ERADICATE OVARIAN TUMORS. AT THE COMPLETION OF THE THESE SPECIFIC AIMS, WE ANTICIPATE TO MAKE TWO SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD OF BIOINORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND OVARIAN CANCER THERAPY: FIRST, WE WILL DELIVER NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ENGAGING PHOTOINDUCED ELECTRON TRANSFER TO ACHIEVE NIR-ACTIVATION OF PT(IV) PRODRUGS TOWARD ELIMINATING OVARIAN CSCS; SECOND, WE WILL CREATE NIR-RESPONSIVE CD36-TARGETABLE PLATINUM-BASED METALLODRUGS WITH HIGH SPECIFICITY AND EFFICACY. THE EDUCATIONAL GOAL OF THIS R15 PROPOSAL IS TO ENHANCE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY (KSU). BASED ON THE DIFFERENT BACKGROUND OF THE TWO PIS, INCLUDING BIOINORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND CANCER BIOLOGY, WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH A MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROGRAM TO TRAIN SIX UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT KSU EVERY YEAR.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id":

CANCER CELLS MODIFY THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD CELLS (I.E., DESMOPLASIA OR STROMA) IN A WAY THAT THESE PROMOTE, INSTEAD OF NORMALLY RESTRICT, TUMOR GROWTH VIA SPECIFIC CANCER ASSOCIATED FIBROBLASTIC CELLS (CAFS). AT THE FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER MARVIN & CONCETTA GREENBERG PANCREATIC CANCER INSTITUTE, EXTENSIVE PRIOR WORK HAS ESTABLISHED THE KEY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PANCREATIC NEIGHBORHOOD, THE NEOADJUVANT-GENERATED LOCAL FIBROSIS, & PATIENT SURVIVAL. WHEN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CELLS (INCLUDING CAFS, IMMUNE & OTHER CELLS) ARE ALTERED BY THE EPITHELIAL CELLS AND/OR BY PREOPERATIVE THERAPY, THIS LOCAL REACTION MAY ENGAGE THERAPY RESISTANCE.

HOWEVER, PLACING AND RETRIEVING IMDS IN TUMORS CURRENTLY REQUIRES HIGHLY INVASIVE SURGERY WITH EXCESSIVELY HIGH PATIENT MORBIDITY AND COMPLICATION RISKS. FOR MOST CANCER PATIENTS, THESE RISKS ARE PROHIBITIVE, AND AS A RESULT ONGOING FIRST-IN-HUMAN IMD TRIALS HAVE HAD LIMITED ENROLLMENT.  WE HAVE DEVELOPED A FULLY INTERVENTIONAL (MINIMALLY INVASIVE) NON-SURGICAL METHOD TO PLACE AND RETRIEVE IMDS. WE USE CUSTOM NEEDLE BIOPSY DEVICES AND IMAGE GUIDANCE TO DELIVER AND PRECISELY REMOVE ONLY THE IMD AND ADJACENT DRUG-EXPOSED TISSUE.

POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) DETECTION OF THE RADIOACTIVE GLUCOSE ANALOG 18F-DEOXYGLUCOSE (FDG) IS WIDELY USED FOR METABOLIC IMAGING OF MANY SOLID CANCERS OUTSIDE OF THE BRAIN. FDG- PET DETECTS HIGH GLUCOSE UPTAKE, WHICH IS OFTEN A SIGN OF ACTIVE AND GROWING TISSUE, SUCH AS IN PROLIFERATING TUMORS. HOWEVER, WHEN USED FOR SCANNING TUMORS IN THE BRAIN FDG-PET HAS SHOWN TO BE OFTEN INCONCLUSIVE. THIS IS NOT DUE TO ANY TECHNICAL LIMITATION, BUT MERELY THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE HIGH GLUCOSE UPTAKE OF NORMAL BRAIN, LEADING TO HIGH BACKGROUND SIGNAL AND THUS LOW METABOLIC IMAGE CONTRAST BETWEEN BRAIN AND TUMOR.  CHOLINE IS AN ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT, AND PROLIFERATING CELLS NEED CHOLINE FOR PHOSPHOLIPID AND MEMBRANE SYNTHESIS. AS A RESULT, MANY TYPES OF CANCER HAVE EVOLVED WITH A HIGH CAPACITY FOR CHOLINE UPTAKE AND METABOLISM. IN CONTRAST, CHOLINE UPTAKE IN NORMAL BRAIN IS IN COMPARISON VERY LOW. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT THE DETECTION OF DEUTERATED CHOLINE UPTAKE AND METABOLISM USING THE NOVEL TECHNIQUE DEUTERIUM METABOLIC IMAGING (DMI) CAN PROVIDE HIGH BRAIN TUMOR-SPECIFIC IMAGE CONTRAST WITH SURROUNDING BRAIN. DMI OF DEUTERIUM (2H)-LABELED CHOLINE ALLOWS DETECTION OF CHOLINE UPTAKE AND/OR CHOLINE METABOLISM, SIMPLY BY VARYING THE TIMING OF THE SCAN IN RELATION TO THE START OF THE CHOLINE ADMINISTRATION.

IMPORTANTLY, INDICATIONS TO RECEIVE ICI THERAPY ARE DEPENDENT ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HIGH TUMOR MUTATION BURDEN (TMB), NEOANTIGEN BURDEN, AND MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY (MSI) STATUS. THESE DIRECT AND INDIRECT MEASURES OF GENOMIC INSTABILITY PREDICT CLINICAL RESPONSE TO ICIS, HOWEVER, ONLY 5% OF PATIENTS ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THESE THERAPIES. PATIENTS WITH MCRC WITH PERITONEAL SPREAD OF DISEASE MAY UNDERGO MAJOR CYTOREDUCTIVE SURGERY (CRS), DURING WHICH ALL GROSS SITES OF DISEASE ARE RESECTED.

WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MAJOR SURGICAL INFLAMMATION FROM CRS AND THE HEAT AND CHEMOTHERAPY OF HIPEC ALTOGETHER INCREASE GENOMIC INSTABILITY.

THUS, OUR WEB-BASED INTERVENTION (PASOS HACIA LA SALUD), IN PARTICULAR, PROVIDES AN IDEAL PLATFORM FOR PROMOTING MUSCLE-STRENGTHENING PA IN THIS AT-RISK POPULATION. TO ADDRESS THE GAP IN LITERATURE ON MUSCLE-STRENGTHENING PA, WE RECENTLY CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH 19 LATINAS TO IDENTIFY THEORY-BASED BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF MUSCLE-STRENGTHENING PA, THEN DEVELOPED MSA INTERVENTION MATERIALS AND ARE FURTHER REFINING FOR CULTURAL APPROPRIATENESS, RELEVANCE, AND APPEAL IN LATINAS. IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, WE WILL INCORPORATE THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MSA PROMOTION MATERIALS INTO OUR EXISTING PASOS HACIA LA SALUD (PASOS) WEB-BASED AEROBIC MVPA INTERVENTION AND CONDUCT A 12-WEEK FULLY ONLINE RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL TESTING THE PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF THE NEWLY ADAPTED WEB-BASED AEROBIC PLUS MSA INTERVENTION FOR LATINAS. FIFTY LATINA ADULTS (I.E., AGED 18-65 YEARS) WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER THE: 1) ORIGINAL PASOS AEROBIC MVPA INTERVENTION ARM, OR 2) A PASOS AEROBIC MVPA PLUS MSA INTERVENTION ARM. OUR STUDY AIMS TO 1) ASSESS THE PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF THE AEROBIC AND MUSCLE-STRENGTHENING INTERVENTION FOR INCREASING MSA, AND 2) EXPLORE POTENTIAL MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS OF MSA. THIS INTERACTIVE AND HIGHLY DISSEMINABLE APPROACH CAN ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS IN AN AT-RISK POPULATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "RI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "378fe7f9-e157-cd75-80cc-97cbe1a426db-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R03CA252500_7529"}, {"internal_id": 83797604, "Award ID": "R03CA250020", "Award Amount": 177954.22, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-02", "CFDA Number": "93.310", "Description": "TOOLS FOR THE UNDERSTUDIED KINASE PNK3", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "be067fa7-a493-7bea-f9cc-e29bd2ccc74a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R03CA250020_7529"}, {"internal_id": 95943491, "Award ID": "R03CA249569", "Award Amount": 250325.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-03-16", "CFDA Number": "93.866", "Description": "BRAIN PENETRANT PARP TARGETED PET IMAGING PROBES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1882697f-2df0-529a-ed60-116702c184a7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R03CA249569_7529"}, {"internal_id": 95484665, "Award ID": "R03CA249554", "Award Amount": 161665.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-02-28", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "DEEP LEARNING FOR RENAL TUMOR CHARACTERIZATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R03CA249554_7529"}, {"internal_id": 130086833, "Award ID": "R03CA245986", "Award Amount": 148500.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-03-24", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "ACCURATE DCE-MRI MEASUREMENT OF GLIOBLASTOMA USING POINT-OF-CARE PORTABLE PERFUSION PHANTOM - PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  THE GOAL OF THIS R03 STUDY IS TO CONDUCT A PILOT STUDY TESTING WHETHER THE VARIABILITY IN QUANTITATIVE DCE- MRI MEASUREMENT OF GLIOBLASTOMA ACROSS DIFFERENT SCANNERS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WHEN THE UAB-INVENTED PERFUSION PHANTOM, P4 (POINT-OF-CARE PORTABLE PERFUSION PHANTOM), IS USED FOR ERROR CORRECTION, LEADING TO BETTER DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN PSEUDO-PROGRESSION AND TRUE-PROGRESSION. THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP BEFORE VALIDATING THE UTILITY OF P4 IN AN EXTENDED MULTI-SITE CLINICAL TRIAL. PSEUDO-PROGRESSION IS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER CLINICAL OUTCOMES, THUS PSEUDO-PROGRESSION MISTAKEN FOR TRUE-PROGRESSION MAY RESULT IN DISCONTINUATION OF AN EFFECTIVE THERAPY. PSEUDO-PROGRESSION IS A LOCAL INFLAMMATORY REACTION CAUSED BY IRRADIATION AND ENHANCED BY CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY, WHICH LEADS TO TRANSIENT INCREASE OF BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) PERMEABILITY. THE BBB, HOWEVER, IS ALSO DISRUPTED BY NEOPLASM, THUS BOTH PSEUDO- AND TRUE-PROGRESSIONS APPEAR WITH INCREASED CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT IN MRI, AND THERE ARE NO ESTABLISHED TECHNIQUES TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THEM. THE CONTRAST- ENHANCING LESIONS OF PSEUDO-PROGRESSION ARE DUE TO INFLAMMATORY BBB DISRUPTION, WHEREAS THOSE OF TRUE- PROGRESSION ARE CAUSED BY NEOPLASTIC BBB DISRUPTION. THUS, TRUE-PROGRESSION TYPICALLY PRESENTS HIGHER PERFUSION THAN PSEUDO-PROGRESSION DOES. DCE-MRI HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PSEUDO- AND TRUE- PROGRESSIONS OF GLIOBLASTOMA, AS IT CAN ASSESS THE BLOOD PERFUSION WITH MINIMAL SUSCEPTIBILITY ARTIFACTS, BUT THE MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN. THE P4 IS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE IMAGED CONCURRENTLY IN THE BORE OF A STANDARD MRI SCANNER WITH A PATIENT, SERVING AS AN INTERNAL REFERENCE TO MEASURE AND COMPENSATE THE SCANNER-DEPENDENT VARIATION IN QUANTITATING PERFUSION PARAMETERS. THE P4 SUCCESSFULLY REDUCES THE VARIABILITY IN DCE-MRI MEASUREMENT OF VARIOUS HUMAN TISSUES IN OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES. WE NOW HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE VARIABILITY IN QUANTITATIVE DCE-MRI MEASUREMENT OF GLIOBLASTOMA ACROSS DIFFERENT SCANNERS WILL ALSO BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WHEN MRI SYSTEM-DRIVEN ERROR IS CORRECTED USING THE P4. IN THIS STUDY, A TOTAL OF 12 PATIENTS WITH A NEWLY (OR ENLARGED) ENHANCING GLIOBLASTOMA AFTER ADJUVANT CHEMORADIATION THERAPY WILL BE RECRUITED. EACH PATIENT WILL BE IMAGED WITH TWO DIFFERENT 3T MRI SCANNERS WITHIN A 3-DAY PERIOD, AND THE TWO DCE-MRI MEASUREMENTS WILL BE COMPARED TO DETERMINE THE DATA REPRODUCIBILITY BEFORE AND AFTER P4-BASED ERROR CORRECTION AND TO VALIDATE THE UTILITY OF THE P4 FOR ACCURATE QUANTITATIVE DCE-MRI MEASUREMENT OF GLIOBLASTOMA.

EARLY CANCER DETECTION AND ACCURATE TUMOR DIAGNOSIS ARE CRUCIAL FOR FAVORABLE CLINICAL OUTCOMES. ULTRASONOGRAPHY (US) IS AN IMPORTANT IMAGING MODALITY ADJUNCT TO MAMMOGRAPHY AS IT IS NONINVASIVE, COST-EFFECTIVE, AND WIDELY AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, THE LOW SPECIFICITY OF US LIMITS ITS DIAGNOSIS ACCURACY, EVEN IN COMBINATION WITH MAMMOGRAPHY. THE RESULTANT UNNECESSARY BENIGN BIOPSIES SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE PATIENTS\u2019 COST AND ANXIETY. TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS CAN BE USED AS A VALUABLE BIOMARKER FOR BETTER BREAST TUMOR US DIFFERENTIATION. HOWEVER, CONVENTIONAL DOPPLER IMAGING HAS INSUFFICIENT VESSEL DETECTION SENSITIVITY. WE HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A NOVEL 2-DIMENSIONAL ULTRA-SENSITIVE ULTRASOUND MICROVESSEL IMAGING (2D-UMI) TECHNOLOGY, WHICH DEMONSTRATES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED VESSEL DETECTION SENSITIVITY OVER CONVENTIONAL DOPPLER METHODS WITHOUT THE NEED OF USING CONTRAST AGENTS. IN OUR PRELIMINARY STUDY, THE DIAGNOSIS ACCURACY OF COMBINING US WITH 2D-UMI WAS IMPROVED BY 15% COMPARED TO USING CONVENTIONAL US ALONE. HOWEVER, 2D TUMOR VASCULARITY EVALUATION MAY BE INCOMPREHENSIVE AS MOST TUMORS ARE HETEROGENEOUS. IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, THE 2D-UMI TECHNIQUE WILL BE ADVANCED TO 3D IMAGING, AND FURTHER ENHANCED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE TUMOR VESSEL INVESTIGATION TO IMPROVE BREAST TUMOR CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY AND REDUCE UNNECESSARY BENIGN BIOPSIES.

WE WILL DEVELOP THE UMI  SEQUENCE IN 3D IMAGING USING A VERASONICS VANTAGE RESEARCH SCANNER. WE WILL APPLY MULTIPLE CODED PLANE  WAVE TRANSMISSIONS TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT INCIDENT ACOUSTIC ENERGY AND ULTRASOUND PENETRATION.

WE WILL THEN USE A CUSTOM FLOW PHANTOM TO TEST AND ENHANCE THE TECHNOLOGY, AND PAVE THE  WAY FOR THE CLINICAL STUDY IN AIM 2.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: CONDUCT A PILOT CLINICAL STUDY OF 3D-UMI ON PATIENTS WITH BREAST MASSES. WE WILL  STUDY 42 PATIENTS WITH BREAST TUMORS TO ASSESS THE 3D-UMI\u2019S EFFICACY IN IMPROVING BREAST TUMOR  CLASSIFICATION. AN EXPERIENCED RADIOLOGIST WILL EVALUATE THE RESULTS. WE WILL THEN COMPARE THE DIAGNOSIS  ACCURACY (USING PATHOLOGY AS THE GOLD STANDARD) BETWEEN THE COMBINED DIAGNOSIS OF CONVENTIONAL US PLUS  3D-UMI VERSUS USE OF CONVENTIONAL US ALONE.

TRANSLATION OF MASSPEC PEN TECHNOLOGY FOR INTRAOPERATIVE EVALUATION OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER - SUMMARY NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER-RELATED DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES FOR WHICH SURGERY REMAINS A CRITICAL TREATMENT OPTION. THE APPROPRIATE EXTENT OF RESECTION FOR NSCLC IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON INTRA-OPERATIVE DECISION-MAKING. SPECIFICALLY, THE DIAGNOSIS OF NSCLC IS OFTEN DETERMINED INTRA-OPERATIVELY BY A LIMITED RESECTION OF A SUSPICIOUS PULMONARY NODULE, AND INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS IS REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING TO A LARGER, CANCER-SPECIFIC RESECTION DURING THE SAME PROCEDURE. FURTHER, INTRAOPERATIVE EVALUATION OF RESECTION MARGINS IS REQUIRED IN NSCLC SURGERIES TO ASSURE COMPLETE CANCER REMOVAL BEFORE LEAVING THE OPERATING ROOM (OR). THUS, THE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY DIAGNOSE NSCLC AND DETERMINE SURGICAL MARGINS IN THE OR IS CRITICAL IN THE CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH NSCLC. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY USED FOR INTRAOPERATIVE EVALUATION OF NSCLC DIAGNOSIS AND MARGINS IS FROZEN SECTION ANALYSIS, A CENTURY-OLD TECHNIQUE THAT IS LABOR-INTENSIVE AND PRONE TO ERROR. FROZEN SECTION ANALYSIS ALSO EXTENDS OPERATIVE TIME, SUBJECTING PATIENTS TO INCREASED RISKS OF SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS. NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY AND ACCURATELY DIAGNOSE NSCLC IN THE OR AND EVALUATE SURGICAL MARGINS WITH HIGH ACCURACY ARE CRITICALLY NEEDED TO IMPROVE SURGICAL CARE AND OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. WE HAVE REPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY, THE MASSPEC PEN (MSPEN), FOR RAPID AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER TISSUES. THE MSPEN DEPLOYS A SINGLE DROPLET OF WATER TO GENTLY EXTRACT MOLECULES FROM TISSUES, WHICH ARE THEN ANALYZED BY MASS SPECTROMETRY (MS) AND STATISTICAL CLASSIFIERS TO PROVIDE DIAGNOSIS IN SECONDS. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MSPEN CAN ACCURATELY DIAGNOSE NSCLC USING BANKED TISSUES WITH 97% ACCURACY. WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT THE MSPEN SYSTEM CAN BE TRANSLATED TO THE OR FOR USE BY SURGEONS FOR RAPID IN VIVO AND EX VIVO TISSUE ANALYSIS. THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS AND SURGEONS AT BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE AND THE R&D TEAM AT MSPEN TECHNOLOGIES INC., WE NOW PROPOSE TO REFINE AND VALIDATE THE MSPEN FOR INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SURGICAL MARGIN EVALUATION IN NSCLC. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO OPTIMIZE AND TRANSLATE NEW MSPEN TECHNOLOGY FOR NSCLC DETECTION, TEST ITS FUNCTIONALITY, AND VALIDATE ITS PERFORMANCE IN THE OR SETTING, THUS DELIVERING A POTENTIALLY IMPROVED PLATFORM FOR INTRAOPERATIVE LUNG TISSUE ANALYSIS TO SURGEONS - THE END USERS. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: AIM 1. OPTIMIZE THE MSPEN TECHNOLOGY FOR INTRAOPERATIVE USE IN NSCLC OPERATIONS. WE WILL DEVELOP A NEXT-GEN MSPEN PLATFORM FOR USE IN OPEN AND ROBOTIC NSCLC SURGERIES; AIM 2. VALIDATE THE MSPEN FOR NSCLC DIAGNOSIS. WE WILL CONDUCT A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY ALLOWING THORACIC SURGEONS TO VALIDATE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR NSCLC DIAGNOSIS IN THE OR; AIM 3. VALIDATE THE MSPEN FOR INTRAOPERATIVE SURGICAL MARGIN EVALUATION IN NSCLC. WE WILL VALIDATE THE MSPEN TECHNOLOGY FOR SURGICAL MARGIN EVALUATION IN VIVO AND EX VIVO, INCLUDING THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE TISSUE MARGINS THAT ARE CURRENTLY DISREGARDED IN CLINICAL CARE.

THE CAUSES OF TREATMENT FAILURE WITH 5-FU-BASED REGIMENS INCLUDE DECREASED METABOLISM TO FDUMP, THE PRIMARY ACTIVE METABOLITE, AND OVEREXPRESSION OF THYMIDYLATE SYNTHASE (TS), THE MOLECULAR TARGET OF FDUMP. TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND OVERCOME RESISTANCE WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NANOSCALE FP POLYMER, CF10, THAT IS COMPRISED OF FDUMP MONOMERS LINKED IN A SINGLE-STRANDED DNA BACKBONE THAT RELEASES FDUMP IN A SINGLE STEP. CF10 DISPLAYS MARKEDLY IMPROVED ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY WITH LOW SYSTEMIC TOXICITY RELATIVE TO 5-FU AND IS A CANDIDATE FOR CLINICAL TRANSLATION.

THERE IS HIGH INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS OF RESPONSE TO ESTABLISHED TREATMENTS SUCH AS TEMOZOLOMIDE, AND TO IDENTIFY RESPONSE AND RESISTANCE BIOMARKERS FOR NEW SINGLE AND COMBINATIONS TREATMENTS FOR GLIOMAS, AS THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT AN EFFECTIVE ADJUVANT TREATMENT STRATEGY CAN IMPROVE SURVIVAL OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. FEW TOOLS EXIST CURRENTLY TO IDENTIFY SUCH BIOMARKERS AND PRIORITIZE WHICH AGENT(S) TO ADMINISTER TO INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF DRUG TREATMENT. WE WILL CONDUCT A CLINICAL STUDY IN WHICH WE MEASURE THE TUMOR RESPONSES TO 20 DISTINCT THERAPIES ACROSS A COHORT OF 32 PATIENTS. USING ONLY INTRASURGICAL PROCEDURES, IMPLANTABLE MICRODEVICES (IMD) ARE PLACED INTO TUMORS PLACED INTO TUMORS DURING ALREADY SCHEDULED TUMOR RESECTIONS, REMAIN IN THE PATIENT FOR THE DURATION OF SURGERY, AND ARE EXTRACTED ALONG WITH THE RESECTED TUMOR SPECIMEN. IMDS ENABLE READOUTS FOR EACH TREATMENT THAT INCLUDE IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL, TRANSCRIPTOMIC, IMMUNE AND TISSUE BIOMARKERS, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY PERFORMING 20 BIOMARKER TRIALS AT MINUTE DRUG EXPOSURE LEVELS IN EACH PATIENT WITH THREE-FOLD REPLICATES. SEVERAL KEY ADVANCES WILL BE ACHIEVED IN THIS PROJECT. FIRST, SAFETY, FEASIBILITY AND CLINICAL INTEGRATION OF THE TECHNICAL WORKFLOW WILL BE DEMONSTRATED IN A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MANNER. THIS IS KEY TOWARDS ESTABLISHING BROADER CLINICAL USE FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTRASURGICAL SETTING. SECONDLY, WE WILL EXAMINE IN A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS WHETHER THE IMD READOUT AT TEMOZOLOMIDE (TMZ) RESERVOIRS CAN SERVE AS A PREDICTIVE MARKER FOR STANDARD SYSTEMIC TMZ TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL AT 6 MONTHS FOR EACH PATIENT. THIS WOULD CONSTITUTE A MAJOR ADVANCE FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS, AS TMZ IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY ADMINISTERED ADJUVANT TREATMENT IN THIS DISEASE, AND THE MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION STATUS IS ONLY A LIMITED PREDICTOR OF TMZ EFFICACY FOR A SUBSET OF GLIOMA PATIENTS. THIRD, WE WILL USE MULTIPLEXED STATE-OF-THE-ART DEEP TISSUE PHENOTYPING TO CHARACTERIZE THE BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE OF EACH PATIENT\u2019S TUMOR EXPOSED TO EACH OF 20 DRUGS ON THE MICRODEVICE.

THESE BONE LESIONS CAUSE PAIN AND SPINAL CORD COMPRESSIONS, LEADING TO PATHOLOGIC FRACTURES AND PARALYSIS, THEREBY DIMINISHING THE PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE. CURRENT THERAPIES RELY ON DIAGNOSING THESE BONE LESIONS BY WHOLE-BODY X-RAY OR BONE SCANS, WHICH ONLY IDENTIFY THEM AT ADVANCED STAGES. WHILE WHOLE-BODY MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (WBMRI) IS RECOMMENDED FOR PRETREATMENT ASSESSMENT (E.G., IN MM), MRI IS OFTEN LIMITED TO SPINE AND PELVIC REGIONS IN PRACTICE TO MINIMIZE PATIENT DISCOMFORT, COMPROMISED IMAGE QUALITY FROM GEOMETRIC DISTORTION, AND HIGH COSTS DUE TO PROLONGED ACQUISITION TIMES. TO ADDRESS THIS UNMET CLINICAL NEED, WE DEVELOPED A NOVEL WBMRI TECHNIQUE: `DUAL-ECHO T2-WEIGHTED ACQUISITION FOR ENHANCED CONSPICUITY OF TUMORS' (DETECT), FOR IMPROVED LESION VISUALIZATION BY SIMULTANEOUSLY SEPARATING THE CONFOUNDING SIGNALS OF FAT AND FLUID. COMPARED TO WBMRI WITH DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED IMAGING (DWI), SINGLE- SHOT DETECT INCREASED LESION DETECTION (>40%) IN CONSIDERABLY SHORTER SCAN TIMES (<10 MIN) AND WITHOUT IMAGE DISTORTIONS. THIS METHOD ALSO IMPROVED ROBUSTNESS TO MOTION IN THE THORACIC AND ABDOMEN REGIONS, HOWEVER, IT SUFFERS FROM IMAGE BLURRING DUE TO T2-DECAY PARTICULARLY IN SPINE AND EXTREMITIES, LIMITING THE DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE. IN THE CURRENT PROPOSAL, WE WILL ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS BY DEVELOPING THE NEXT- GENERATION WBMRI-DETECT USING AN EFFICIENT COMBINATION OF SINGLE-SHOT AND MULTI-SHOT ACQUISITIONS. DETECT ALSO GENERATES FAT SIGNAL FOR QUANTITATIVE FAT FRACTION (FF) MAPS THAT CAN BE USED AS A PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKER IN MM, SINCE TUMOR CELLS REPLACE FAT, A MAJOR CONSTITUENT OF BONE MARROW.

SCIENCE ADVANCES 2017) WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NEW METABOLIC VULNERABILITY IN THE GLYCOLYTIC METABOLISM OF LEUKEMIA (JEONG ET AL. CELL METABOLISM 2021). THIS RELIANCE ON GLYCOLYTIC METABOLISM ALTERS NOT ONLY GLUCOSE FLUX TO LACTATE, BUT ALSO ONE-CARBON FLUX THROUGH THE SERINE PATHWAY, WHICH FACILITATES THE METABOLISM OF GLUTAMINE. MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT GENETICALLY TARGETING OR PHARMACOLOGICALLY INHIBITING THE ENZYME THAT MEDIATES FLUX THROUGH THIS PATHWAY (PHGDH) CAPITALIZES ON A NEW VULNERABILITY IN THESE CELLS. IMPORTANTLY, THIS TARGETING DOES NOT AFFECT NORMAL HEMATOPOIETIC CELL GROWTH. THUS, BUILDING UPON EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN OUR LABS AND AMPLE PRELIMINARY DATA, WE AIM TO EMPLOY INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO STUDY METABOLISM (KESHARI LAB), INCLUDING BY DEVELOPING NON-INVASIVE PROBES TO MEASURE CHANGES IN GLYCOLYSIS AND OXIDATIVE STRESS WITH HYPERPOLARIZED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING.

AS PROTEIN ABUNDANCE CANNOT BE INFERRED PRECISELY FROM TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATA, IT IS IMPORTANT TO MEASURE PROTEIN ABUNDANCE AND THEIR SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION TO BETTER PREDICT PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA, AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY BIOMARKERS AND THERAPEUTIC TARGETS.  PREVIOUS WORK ON SPATIAL PROTEOMICS IS BASED ON ANTIBODY RECOGNITION, MASS SPECTROMETRY IMAGING, OR PHYSICAL DISSECTION OF THE TISSUE FOLLOWED BY LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY (LC-MS/MS). ANTIBODY-BASED AND MASS SPECTROMETRY IMAGING APPROACHES HAVE LOW PROTEOME COVERAGE (<100 PROTEINS). THE ONLY APPROACH WITH DEEP COVERAGE (>3000 PROTEINS) IS TISSUE DISSECTION FOLLOWED BY LC-MS/MS. THIS METHOD LEVERAGES THE POWER OF STATE-OF-THE-ART LC-MS/MS TO ACHIEVE IN-DEPTH QUANTIFICATION OF THOUSANDS OF PROTEINS ALONG WITH THEIR POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH IS LIMITED BY CURRENT DISSECTION METHODS. MANUAL DISSECTION HAS LOW THROUGHPUT AND POOR SPATIAL RESOLUTION. LASER CAPTURE MICRODISSECTION (LCM) HAS HIGH RESOLUTION, BUT THE ISOLATION OF MANY PIXELS, REQUIRED FOR TISSUE MAPPING, IS TEDIOUS AND SUFFERS FROM SAMPLE LOSS.  THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A HIGH THROUGHPUT AND SCALABLE TECHNOLOGY TO PERFORM TISSUE MICRODISSECTION THAT PRESERVES TISSUE SPATIAL INFORMATION AND COUPLES DIRECTLY TO ESTABLISHED LC-MS/MS WORKFLOW FOR DEEP AND UNBIASED SPATIAL MAPPING OF THE PROTEOME.

HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES WERE DONE ON TUMOR TISSUES FROM SURGICALLY REMOVED (ENUCLEATED) EYES WITH ADVANCED RB, AS TUMOR BIOPSY IS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO THE REAL RISK OF TUMOR EXTRAOCULAR DISSEMINATION. AS A RESULT, RB TUMOR DNA WAS NEVER PREVIOUSLY ACCESSIBLE ASIDE FROM THESE ENUCLEATED SPECIMENS, AND THERE IS LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR ALTERATIONS THAT MAY DRIVE TUMOR BEHAVIOR. FURTHERMORE, ANY APPLICATION OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC OR USE OF PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS FOR PERSONALIZED MEDICINE IN VIVO IS LIMITED BY THE LACK OF TUMOR TISSUE AT DIAGNOSIS OR DURING THERAPY. THUS, A LIQUID BIOPSY APPROACH, WHICH OVERCOMES THIS CRITICAL LACK OF TUMOR TISSUE, WAS NEEDED FOR THIS DISEASE. WITH SUPPORT OF AN NCI K08, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE AQUEOUS HUMOR (AH), AN INTRAOCULAR FLUID, IS AN ENRICHED SOURCE OF TUMOR-DERIVED CELL-FREE DNA (CFDNA). WE DEVELOPED A LIQUID BIOPSY ASSAY TO DETECT SOMATIC COPY NUMBER ALTERATIONS (SCNAS) AND PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IN THE RB1 TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE FROM A SINGLE 100 L SAMPLE OF AH. WE IDENTIFIED THAT THE GENOMIC ALTERATIONS FROM THE AH ARE HIGHLY CONCORDANT (>94%) WITH THOSE FOUND IN THE TUMOR OF ENUCLEATED EYES. WE IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL CANDIDATE BIOMARKERS, CHROMOSOME 6P GAIN AND/OR FOCAL MYCNA IN THE AH CFDNA THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A 16.5-FOLD INCREASED RISK OF TREATMENT FAILURE REQUIRING SURGICAL REMOVAL OF THE EYE. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT CHANGES IN AH CFDNA TUMOR FRACTION (TFX) CORRELATE WITH TREATMENT RESPONSE, WITH INCREASES IN TFX INDICATIVE OF RECURRENCE OR MINIMAL RESIDUAL INTRAOCULAR DISEASE. THIS SUGGESTS THAT TFX ALONE MAY SERVE AS A RELIABLE REAL-TIME BIOMARKER FOR TREATMENT RESPONSE.

THE BLOOD TEST ENSURES THAT ONLY HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS ARE SCREENED AND THE IMMUNOPET CONFIRMS AND LOCALIZES THE TUMOR FOR FUTURE TREATMENT. THUS, IN AIM 1, WE PROPOSE TO DEFINE THE ROLE OF SCLC-SPECIFIC AUTOANTIGENS (AAG), ISOLATE HUMAN B CELLS SPECIFIC TO THE AAG, TEST THE AAG AS HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC EARLY DETECTION BIOMARKERS, AND SEQUENCE THE AAB VARIABLE REGIONS AND CLONE THEM INTO EXPRESSION VECTORS TO PRODUCE HUMAN MONOCLONAL RECOMBINANT ANTIBODIES FOR IMAGING PURPOSES.

BREAST CANCER SURVIVORSHIP IS INCREASING, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH WEIGHT GAIN, INCREASED FAT MASS, INSOMNIA, AND DISEASE RISK, MAKING BREAST CANCER SURVIVORSHIP A MAJOR HEALTHCARE PRIORITY. WEIGHT LOSS IS A STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH BREAST CANCER WITH OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY; HOWEVER, ACHIEVING CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINED WEIGHT LOSS IS CHALLENGING IN GENERAL, AND PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE UNDERGONE BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. WHILE SEVERAL TRIALS HAVE TESTED THE EFFECTS OF BEHAVIORAL WEIGHT LOSS (BWL) IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS DO NOT ACHIEVE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT LOSS. INSOMNIA DISORDER IS ALSO HIGHLY PREVALENT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH BREAST CANCER AND, LIKE OBESITY, PREDICTS BREAST CANCER RISK, PROGRESSION AND DEATH. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT INADEQUATE SLEEP MAY DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO OBESITY AND IMPAIR WEIGHT LOSS EFFORTS VIA MANY BEHAVIORAL AND BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS. SEVERAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I) IS EFFICACIOUS IN TREATING BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. ONE APPROACH THAT HAS YET TO BE TESTED IN A LARGE SCALE STUDY, HOWEVER, IS ADDING AN INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY BEFORE A BWL INTERVENTION.

AMONG THE MANY POSSIBLE CAUSES, STROMAL COLLAGEN ORGANIZATION IS NEWLY A FOCUS OF INTENSE INTEREST DUE TO ITS RECENTLY PROVEN ASSOCIATION WITH BREAST CANCER STAGE, PROGNOSIS, TREATMENT RESPONSE, AND OTHER CLINICAL FEATURES. THEREFORE, DELINEATING STROMAL COLLAGEN ORGANIZATION IN VIVO WOULD NOT ONLY IMPROVE BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT MANAGEMENT BUT ALSO HELP TO ELUCIDATE THE COMPLEX AND POORLY UNDERSTOOD PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF BREAST CANCER DEVELOPMENT, PROGRESSION, AND AGGRESSIVENESS.

THE LACK OF A ROBUST ULTRASOUND APPROACH TO INTERROGATING STROMAL COLLAGEN ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS A MAJOR GAP IN EXPLOITING A RAPIDLY EMERGING AND HIGHLY PROMISING BIOMARKER FOR BREAST CANCER. TO FILL THIS GAP, OUR GROUP HAS DEVELOPED VISCOELASTIC RESPONSE (VISR) ULTRASOUND, AN ON-AXIS APPROACH TO INTERROGATING COLLAGEN FIBER ORGANIZATION VIA STIFFNESS ANISOTROPY IN BREAST MASSES AND SURROUNDING STROMA WITHOUT OBSERVING SHEAR WAVE PROPAGATION.

WE SHOWED THAT CDDP AND OTHER GENOTOXIC AGENTS TRIGGER MEASURABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN TUMOR CELL METABOLISM DETECTABLE THROUGH HP-MRI WITH [1-13C]-PYRUVATE IN REAL TIME (CONFIRMED BY CONVENTIONAL BIOCHEMICAL ASSAYS).

HOWEVER, BARRIERS REMAIN IN ACHIEVING DURABLE REMISSIONS (>1 YEAR) FOR ~50% OF PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE CAR T CELL THERAPY. DUE TO THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THESE THERAPIES AND A GREAT NEED FOR PROCESS OPTIMIZATION, WE FOCUS ON IMPROVING THREE TRANSLATIONAL ROADBLOCKS TO EFFECTIVE CAR T CELL THERAPY: (1) SCREENING PATIENTS WHOSE T CELLS ARE UNFIT FOR CAR T CELL MANUFACTURING, (2) OPTIMIZING IN VITRO CAR T CELL PRODUCTION FOR HIGHER POTENCY, AND (3) IDENTIFYING METABOLIC FEATURES OF POTENT CAR T CELLS IN VIVO. CAR T CELL THERAPY COULD BE IMPROVED BY ENRICHING FOR NA\u00cfVE AND STEM CELL MEMORY (SCM) T CELLS IN STARTING MATERIALS AND FINAL PRODUCTS. DEFICIENCIES IN NA\u00cfVE AND SCM T CELLS OCCURS IN ~50% OF UNTREATED CANCER PATIENTS, AND MANUFACTURING AUTOLOGOUS CAR T CELL PRODUCTS FROM THESE SOURCES HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. EVEN IF SCM T CELLS CAN BE ISOLATED, AFTER CAR INCORPORATION, THE EXPANSION PROCESS TYPICALLY DIMINISHES POTENCY THROUGH T CELL EXHAUSTION. AFTER INFUSION, THE PRESENCE OF MEMORY-LIKE PHENOTYPES IN VIVO CORRELATE WITH BETTER RESPONSES. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO ROBUST, NON-DESTRUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO MONITOR CAR T CELL MANUFACTURING TO OPTIMIZE PRODUCTION AND ASSESS POTENCY IN VIVO AT A SINGLE-CELL LEVEL. THESE ISSUES LIMIT THE IMPACT OF CAR T CELL THERAPY. CURRENT APPROACHES TO MEASURE T CELL FUNCTION ARE LABOR-INTENSIVE, DESTRUCTIVE, OR LACK SINGLE-CELL RESOLUTION, WHICH LIMITS THE FREQUENCY OR SPECIFICITY OF THESE MEASUREMENTS. FOR CAR T CELL THERAPY TO REALIZE ITS CLINICAL POTENTIAL, NEW METHODS ARE NEEDED TO MONITOR T CELLS FOR OPTIMAL POTENCY THROUGHOUT MANUFACTURING AND POST- INFUSION. CHANGES IN CELL METABOLISM PROVIDE AN ATTRACTIVE YET UNDER-EXPLORED ASSAY TO TRACK T CELL POTENCY.

A PRIMARY APPLICATION IS THE STUDY OF ENERGY METABOLISM, A FUNDAMENTAL PROCESS FOR VIRTUALLY ALL CELLS IN THE BODY. IN PARTICULAR, GLUCOSE (GLC) METABOLISM PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN CANCER, WITH TWO KEY METRICS OF TUMOR METABOLISM BEING TOTAL GLUCOSE CONSUMPTION AND THE RELATIVE FRACTION OF GLC UNDERGOING GLYCOLYSIS (GLY) VERSUS OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION (OXPHOS). IN CONTRAST TO NORMAL TISSUES, MOST CANCERS EXHIBIT A PREPONDERANCE OF GLY OVER OXPHOS. KNOWN AS THE WARBURG EFFECT OR, MORE GENERALLY METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING, THESE ALTERATIONS ARE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED IN GLIOMA AND OTHER BRAIN TUMORS. ELEVATED GLY IN HIGH-GRADE BRAIN TUMORS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A MARKER OF TUMOR GROWTH AND AGGRESSIVENESS. FROM A THERAPEUTIC PERSPECTIVE, STUDIES STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT THIS WARBURG PHENOTYPE IS NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT FOR THE CANCER PROCESS, WHICH PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK OF A HIGHLY NOVEL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY TARGETED AT AFFECTING THESE METABOLIC PATHWAYS. WE CONTEND THAT CLINICAL TRANSLATION IS PRESENTLY IMPEDED NOT SO MUCH BY A LACK OF AGENTS, BUT BY THE DIFFICULTY IN MEASURING THESE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF TUMOR METABOLISM IN VIVO.  OF THE AVAILABLE IMAGING TECHNIQUES, 18F-FDG-PET IS WELL-ESTABLISHED FOR IMAGING GLUCOSE UPTAKE, WHEREAS ROBUST IN VIVO MEASUREMENTS OF GLY AND OXPHOS ARE CONSIDERABLY MORE CHALLENGING. TRIPLE 15O-PET CAN BE USED TO ASSESS OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (AND HENCE OXPHOS) BUT IS CLINICALLY PROBLEMATIC DUE TO THE 2-MIN HALF- LIFE OF 15O AND THE CHALLENGES OF COORDINATING MULTIPLE INHALED RADIOACTIVE GASES.

THE SUCCESS OF THIS AIM WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC PATTERNS OF RTDNA/APT THROUGHOUT THE TREATMENT COURSE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH GBM. IF OUR RTDNA/APT INVESTIGATION IS SUCCESSFUL, THE RESULTS WOULD DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THE CARE OF PATIENTS TREATED WITH CRT AND SPARE MANY PATIENTS FROM UNDERGOING SURGERY FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01CA276221_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160082835, "Award ID": "R01CA276178", "Award Amount": 676561.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-08", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "INTEGRATED BLOOD AND RADIOMIC SUBTYPING TO GUIDE IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT SELECTION AND EARLY RESPONSE ASSESSMENT IN METASTATIC NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER - ABSTRACT IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS (ICIS) HAVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES IN METASTATIC NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC), AND PROVIDERS MAY NOW CHOOSE BETWEEN MULTIPLE FIRST-LINE ICI-BASED REGIMENS INCLUDING ICI MONOTHERAPY AND ICI WITH CHEMOTHERAPY.

OUR GROUP WAS THE FIRST TO INTRODUCE THE FOCUSED ULTRASOUND (FUS)-ENABLED LIQUID BIOPSY TECHNIQUE FOR NONINVASIVE AND SPATIALLY TARGETED MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BRAIN TUMORS, WHICH WE TERM SONOBIOPSY. THE CURRENT BARRIER TO THE WIDESPREAD USE OF SONOBIOPSY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE IS THE LACK OF HUMAN DATA THAT RIGOROUSLY CHARACTERIZES THE SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE.

THIS CONTRIBUTES BOTH TO SUBOPTIMAL LUNG CANCER OUTCOMES AND UNNECESSARY MORBIDITY, MORTALITY AND HEALTHCARE COSTS. WHILE HISTOLOGIC GRADE OF RESECTED TUMORS CORRELATES WITH PATIENT OUTCOME, IT IS ONLY AVAILABLE AFTER SURGICAL TREATMENT AND CANNOT BE USED TO INFORM PRE-SURGERY MANAGEMENT OR SURGICAL PLANNING. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED CANARY, A RADIOMIC BIOMARKER THAT PREDICTS LUAD AGGRESSIVENESS. WE HAVE FURTHER DEVELOPED TWO GENE EXPRESSION BIOMARKERS FROM RESECTED FFPE STAGE I LUAD FOR PREDICTING INDOLENT OR AGGRESSIVE TUMOR HISTOLOGY. THESE GENE EXPRESSION BIOMARKERS ARE INSENSITIVE TO INTRATUMORAL HETEROGENEITY, SUGGESTING THAT THEY MIGHT RETAIN GOOD PERFORMANCE WHEN MEASURED IN LIMITED TISSUE AVAILABLE FROM SMALL, PRESURGICAL BIOPSIES. THIS IS POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE AS HISTOLOGIC ASSESSMENT OF THESE SMALL BIOPSIES IS FREQUENTLY INSUFFICIENT FOR PREDICTING TUMOR AGGRESSIVENESS.

ICANS THEREFORE REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR THE WIDER ADOPTION OF CAR-T CELL THERAPY, CREATING AN URGENT NEED TO MITIGATE OR PREVENT ICANS, TO UNDERSTAND ITS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND TO PREDICT ITS ADVERSE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES.

THESE DISMAL OUTCOMES UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR NEW AND MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR BCBM. CHIMERIC ANTIGEN RECEPTOR (CAR) T CELL THERAPY HAS LED TO DURABLE RESPONSES IN PATIENTS WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF BLOOD CANCERS. HOWEVER, THE TREATMENT OF BRAIN TUMORS, SUCH AS BCBM, INVOLVES A UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES, INCLUDING LIMITED INFILTRATION OF CAR T CELLS, HETEROGENOUS EXPRESSION OF TARGET CAR ANTIGENS, AND HIGH SYSTEMIC TOXICITY. ALTHOUGH DIRECT INTRACRANIAL ADMINISTRATION OF CAR T CELLS HAS RESULTED IN ANTI-TUMOR RESPONSES IN A FEW PATIENTS WITH RELATIVELY LOW SYSTEMIC TOXICITY, BCBM IS MULTIFOCAL AND REQUIRES REPEAT TREATMENTS, WHICH POSE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO EFFECTIVE DELIVERY. MOREOVER, IN RECENT CLINICAL TRIALS, HETEROGENEOUS ANTIGEN EXPRESSION LED TO RELAPSE FROM THE OUTGROWTH OF ANTIGEN-NEGATIVE TUMOR CELLS. THEREFORE, NEW STRATEGIES THAT CAN CONCURRENTLY INCREASE CAR T CELL INFILTRATION, COMBAT TUMOR HETEROGENEITY, AND LIMIT OFF TARGET TOXICITY ARE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL AND UNMET NEED TO TREAT BCBM.

OUR OPTICAL MOHS APPROACH WILL BE BASED ON MULTIMODAL CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY (MCM) COMBINED WITH MACHINE LEARNING TO PROVIDE A LOW INFRASTRUCTURE, AUTOMATED DIAGNOSTIC TOOL REQUIRING MINIMAL TISSUE PROCESSING. MCM COMBINES REFLECTANCE, FLUORESCENCE, AND RAMAN CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY INTO A SINGLE BENCHTOP PLATFORM. MCM (USING REFLECTANCE AND FLUORESCENCE) HAS RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS IN PRODUCING H&E IMAGES OF UNPROCESSED, FRESHLY EXCISED SKIN THAT PATHOLOGIST CAN READ WITH ACCURACY COMPARABLE TO FROZEN SECTION HISTOPATHOLOGY.

A POORLY MET CLINICAL NEED IN BREAST CANCER THERAPY IS PROVIDING INEXPENSIVE AND ACCURATE WAYS TO IDENTIFY PATIENT RESPONSES TO CHEMOTHERAPY EARLY DURING THE COURSE OF THERAPY. FOR MANY BREAST CANCERS, LACK OF PATIENT RESPONSE TO INITIAL THERAPY IS PREDICTIVE OF POOR OUTCOME, WHEREAS PATHOLOGICAL COMPLETE RESPONSE STRONGLY CORRELATES WITH EXTENDED SURVIVAL. CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL SURROGATES OF RESPONSE BASED ON ANATOMICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS PHYSICAL ASSESSMENTS, MAMMOGRAPHY AND STANDARD CLINICAL ULTRASOUND PROVIDE POOR EARLY ASSESSMENTS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE.

THESE QUSB RESULTS WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY FROM IMPROVED VOLUMETRIC ACCURACY THAT CONVENTIONAL SCANNING PLATFORMS DO NOT SUPPORT, SUCH AS TRANSMISSION AND ATTENUATION LOSSES IN THE SIGNALS.

THESE MODELS, HOWEVER, HAVE UNIQUE CHALLENGES WHEN USED FOR TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES, INCLUDING (1) HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN ORGANOIDS FROM THE SAME PATIENT, (2) ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES THAT REQUIRE SAMPLE FIXATION OR REAGENTS THAT PREVENT TIME-COURSE STUDIES OF CLONAL EVOLUTION, AND (3) LACK OF SINGLE ORGANOID ASSESSMENT AND LOW- THROUGHPUT CULTURE TECHNIQUES THAT LIMIT SCREENS FOR NEW DRUGS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED OPTICAL METABOLIC IMAGING (OMI) USING TWO-PHOTON (2P) MICROSCOPY TO MEASURE TREATMENT RESPONSE WITHOUT A NEED FOR REAGENTS (E.G., DYES, LABELS) OR FIXATION. OUR PRIOR STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT 2P OMI CAN PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. HOWEVER, 2P MICROSCOPY IS HIGH COST, LOW THROUGHPUT, AND COMPLEX TO OPERATE. TO EXPAND THE USE OF OMI ACROSS MULTI-CENTER TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES OF PDCOS, MORE READILY ACCESSIBLE IMAGING AND ANALYSIS METHODS ARE NEEDED FOR HIGH/MODERATE THROUGHPUT DRUG SCREENING AND ASSESSMENTS OF ORGANOID METABOLIC HETEROGENEITY OVER TIME.

LOW-DOSE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) IS THE RECOMMENDED SCREENING TEST FOR LUNG CANCER, HOWEVER, ITS HIGH FALSE-POSITIVE RATE LEADS TO UNNECESSARY BIOPSY AND REPEATED RADIATION EXPOSURE. IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS (ICIS) HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED TREATMENT FOR LUNG CANCER, HOWEVER, THEY ARE ONLY EFFECTIVE FOR A MINORITY OF PATIENTS. PREDICTING AND MONITORING RESPONSES TO ICIS BY TISSUE BIOPSY AND IMAGING ARE LIMITED BY INVASIVE PROCEDURE, THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE TUMOR BIOMARKERS, PSEUDO PROGRESSION, AND DELAYED RESPONSE. THEREFORE, NON-INVASIVE, ACCURATE AND AFFORDABLE METHODS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO DETECT LUNG CANCER EARLY AND TO EFFECTIVELY PREDICT AND MONITOR RESPONSE TO ICIS, AIDING IN IMPROVING PATIENT OUTCOMES.  LIQUID BIOPSY DETECTS TUMOR-DERIVED BIOMARKERS IN BODY FLUIDS SUCH AS BLOOD, COMPLEMENTS IMAGING AND RISK FACTOR DATA, ALLOWS SEQUENTIAL MONITORING OF CANCER DEVELOPMENT, AND THUS REPRESENTS A NEW AND NON-INVASIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THESE UNMET NEEDS. EXOSOMES ARE NANO-SIZED EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES SECRETED BY CELLS. THEY ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN EVERY STEP OF CANCER DEVELOPMENT AND HAVE EMERGED AS PROMISING CANCER BIOMARKERS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT TUMOR-DERIVED EXOSOMES (TEXS) ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC FOR LUNG CANCER EARLY DETECTION AND TREATMENT RESPONSE PREDICTION AND MONITORING, AND THE COMBINATION OF TEX MARKERS PROVIDES SUPERIOR DIAGNOSTIC AND PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCES THAN SINGLE MARKERS ALONE.  A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN DEVELOPING EXOSOMES-BASED CANCER BIOMARKERS IS THE SEPARATION OF TEXS FROM EXOSOMES RELEASED BY NORMAL CELLS, THE LATTER OF WHICH CAN RENDER THE TEST LESS SENSITIVE OR INCAPABLE OF DETECTING TEX BIOMARKERS. TO OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN EXOSOME PROTEIN RNA ONE STOP (EXO-PROS) BIOSENSOR.

THE INCIDENCE RATES FOR LIVER CANCER HAVE MORE THAN TRIPLED SINCE 1980, MAKING IT THE 5TH LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER- RELATED DEATHS IN THE US. APPROXIMATELY THREE-FOURTHS OF LIVER CANCER CASES ARE HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC). AS FOR ALL CANCERS, DETECTION OF HCC AT AN EARLIER STAGE IS CRITICAL TO ELICIT THE BEST CHANCE OF A CURE. EARLY DETECTION OF HCC HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MORTALITY RATES, DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT EFFICACY OF LOCAL TREATMENTS FOR EARLY-STAGE DISEASE VS. SYSTEMIC THERAPY FOR ADVANCED-STAGE CANCERS. ALTHOUGH SURVEILLANCE OF PATIENTS AT HIGH- RISK FOR HCC (E.G., THOSE WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS OR LIVER CIRRHOSIS [LC]) IS WIDELY PERFORMED, THE POPULATION OF PATIENTS WITH HCC WITHOUT VIRAL ETIOLOGIES IS INCREASING BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT SCREENING FOR HCC. AT PRESENT, ALPHA-FETOPROTEIN (AFP) IS THE MOST WIDELY USED BLOOD TUMOR MARKER; AND HEPATIC ULTRASOUND IS A LOW-COST IMAGING METHOD FOR SURVEILLANCE OF HCCS. HOWEVER, BOTH APPROACHES HAVE LIMITED SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FOR DETECTING EARLY-STAGE HCC, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPERATIVE NEED TO DEVELOP ROBUST BIOMARKERS FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF HCC. ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT DYSREGULATION OF MICRORNAS (MIRNAS) OCCURS IN ALL HUMAN CANCERS, INCLUDING HCC. AS BIOMARKERS, MIRNAS ARE MORE RESILIENT THAN MRNAS, AND ARE FREQUENTLY DEREGULATED EVEN IN THE EARLIEST STAGES OF NEOPLASIA.

WHILE EXOSOMES ARE CONSIDERED TO REFLECT THEIR RESPECTIVE CELLS-OF-ORIGIN, THEIR USE IN BIOMARKER RESEARCH HAS BEEN HAMPERED DUE TO LACK OF STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS FOR THEIR ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION, USE OF CELL LINE-DERIVED, BUT NOT PATIENT-DERIVED SPECIMENS FOR BIOMARKER DISCOVERY; AND LACK OF BIOMARKER DISCOVERY IN CANCER-DERIVED EXOSOMES FROM MATCHED TISSUES AND PLASMA SPECIMENS. FURTHERMORE, DESPITE THE PERCEPTION THAT EXOSOMAL-MIRNAS (EXO-MIRNAS) MAY BE SUPERIOR TO CIRCULATING CELL-FREE MIRNAS (CF-MIRNAS), NO STUDIES HAVE UNDERTAKEN AN EFFORT TO DIRECTLY COMPARE THESE TWO TYPES, TO SUPPORT OR NEGATE THEIR SUPERIORITY AS DISEASE BIOMARKERS.

BREAST CANCER SCREENING PROGRAMS SUFFER FROM FALSE POSITIVE MAMMOGRAMS, UNNECESSARY BIOPSIES, OVERDIAGNOSIS, AND OVERTREATMENT. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY IS THE DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC UNCERTAINTY OF MAMMOGRAPHICALLY DETECTED CALCIFICATIONS. BREAST CALCIFICATIONS REPRESENT A BIOLOGICAL CONTINUUM FROM BENIGN DISEASE TO DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) TO AGGRESSIVE CANCER. RADIOLOGISTS STRUGGLE TO CORRELATE THEIR IMAGING APPEARANCE WITH THE UNDERLYING PATHOLOGY AND ROUGHLY TWO-THIRDS OF BIOPSIED CALCIFICATIONS RETURN WITH A BENIGN PATHOLOGY. ALTHOUGH CALCIFICATIONS EVOLVE DYNAMICALLY OVER TIME, THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY RELIES HEAVILY ON THE STATIC APPEARANCE OF CALCIFICATIONS FROM THE MOST RECENT MAMMOGRAM. MOST WOMEN IN SCREENING PROGRAMS HAVE MULTIPLE MAMMOGRAMS, YET THIS TEMPORAL INFORMATION IS CONSISTENTLY UNDERUTILIZED IN CLINICAL DECISION MAKING. THERE IS THUS AN URGENT NEED TO QUANTIFY THE DYNAMICS OF CALCIFICATIONS FROM SERIAL MAMMOGRAMS, AND TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALCIFICATION TRAJECTORIES AND DISEASE BIOLOGY. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH INNOVATION, INCREASINGLY SENSITIVE SCREENING MODALITIES ARE EXPECTED TO FURTHER INCREASE THE BURDEN OF UNNECESSARY DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP AND BREAST CANCER OVERDIAGNOSIS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT DYNAMIC IMAGEABLE AND TISSUE BIOMARKERS CONTAIN ACTIONABLE DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC INFORMATION ABOUT MAMMOGRAPHIC CALCIFICATIONS. THE USE OF ESTABLISHED DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING (MAMMOGRAPHY) IN CONJUNCTION WITH INVESTIGATIONAL IMAGEABLE BIOMARKERS WILL ENABLE TESTING OF THIS HYPOTHESIS. KEY TO THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE THE CREATION OF A LARGE DATABASE OF RETROSPECTIVELY AND PROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED COHORTS OF PATIENTS WITH SERIAL MAMMOGRAMS, TISSUE SAMPLES AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. THIS PROPOSAL WILL CONSIST OF THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) DEVELOP A STATIC MODEL OF BREAST CALCIFICATIONS TO IMPROVE THE CLINICAL PERFORMANCE OF MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING; 2) DEVELOP A DYNAMIC MODEL OF BREAST CALCIFICATIONS TO PREDICT HISTOPATHOLOGY AND DCIS PROGNOSIS; AND 3) COMBINE THE DYNAMIC CALCIFICATION MODEL WITH TISSUE-BASED BIOMARKERS OF THE UNDERLYING EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS TO DELINEATE DCIS PROGNOSIS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS HIGHLY INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT ADDS THE TEMPORAL DIMENSION TO COMPUTER-ASSISTED CLASSIFICATION OF MAMMOGRAPHIC CALCIFICATIONS, YIELDS A JOINT CHARACTERIZATION OF CALCIFICATION GROWTH TRAJECTORIES AND LESION BIOLOGY, AND DEVELOPS DYNAMIC RISK MODELS TO PREDICT INVASIVE PROGRESSION IN WOMEN UNDERGOING ACTIVE MONITORING FOR DCIS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE CO-LED BY DR. GRIMM (BREAST RADIOLOGIST) AND DR. RYSER (MATHEMATICAL MODELER) SUPPORTED BY A HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM WITH EXPERTISE IN CANCER BIOLOGY, COMPUTER VISION, AND SURGICAL ONCOLOGY. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A DYNAMIC IMAGEABLE BIOMARKER THAT DELINEATES LETHAL CANCER FROM NON- LETHAL DISEASE BY LEVERAGING THE TEMPORAL DIMENSION OF SERIAL MAMMOGRAMS. ULTIMATELY, THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF OUR WORK IS TO BETTER IDENTIFY WHICH CALCIFICATIONS TO BIOPSY (REDUCE UNNECESSARY BIOPSIES), AND IF PRE-INVASIVE DCIS IS FOUND, TO PREDICT WHETHER IT WILL REMAIN INDOLENT OR PROGRESS TO LETHAL CANCER (REDUCE OVERTREATMENT).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6f191f83-6024-f2be-3012-4b740b10ac7a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01CA271237_7529"}, {"internal_id": 155957875, "Award ID": "R01CA270783", "Award Amount": 570260.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-01-10", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS ON STRUCTURE, TOPOLOGY AND RADIATION EFFECTS ON RNA NANOMEDICINES - PROJECT ABSTRACT RNA THERAPEUTICS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING NANOMEDICINES ARE POISED TO RAPIDLY CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE OF HEALTHCARE.

POUNDS DEVELOPED THE INNOVATIVE INTEGRATIVE ANALYSIS PROCEDURE, CANONICAL CORRELATION WITH PROJECTION ONTO THE MOST INTERESTING STATISTICAL EVIDENCE (CC-PROMISE), THAT DRAMATICALLY INCREASES STATISTICAL POWER FOR MEANINGFUL BIOLOGICAL DISCOVERY IN A RARE-DISEASE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE SETTING; USING CC-PROMISE, WE DISCOVERED THAT REDUCED METHYLATION AND INCREASED EXPRESSION OF THE DNMT3B ASSOCIATES WITH GREATER GENOME-WIDE METHYLATION BURDEN AND WORSE PROGNOSIS; TRANSLATING THE DNMT3B DISCOVERY INTO EVALUATION OF DEMETHYLATING AGENTS IN THE ONGOING AML16 CLINICAL TRIAL (NCT03164057). THESE GENOMIC, EPIGENOMIC, AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC FEATURES, ALONG WITH MICROENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER FACTORS, MUST IMPACT THE PROTEOME AND METABOLOME OF AML IN CLINICALLY RELEVANT WAYS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THERE HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY NO STUDY FOCUSED ON COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF THE PROTEOME AND METABOLOME OF PEDIATRIC AML IN A REASONABLE COHORT OF UNIFORMLY TREATED PATIENTS. NOTING THE MARKED GENOMIC, TRANSCRIPTOMIC, METHYLOMIC, AND PROGNOSTIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEDIATRIC AND ADULT AML, IT IS NOT PLAUSIBLE TO EXTRAPOLATE FINDING FROM ADULT AML PATIENTS TO PEDIATRIC. THUS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR DISEASE BIOLOGY IS NEEDED TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES AND IMPROVE THE PROGNOSIS OF PEDIATRIC AML.

TUMOR RECURRENCE IS NEARLY UNIVERSAL, AND THE MEDIAN PATIENT SURVIVAL (~15 MONTHS) HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 20 YEARS. RADICAL NEW IDEAS AND APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE.  NEW NEUROSURGICAL APPROACHES TO TREATING GBM ARE EMERGING WITH THE FDA APPROVAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE AND IMAGE-GUIDED TECHNOLOGIES THAT NOW ENABLE ACCESS TO AND TREATMENT OF PREVIOUSLY UNRESECTABLE AND COMPLEX RECURRENT TUMORS. A MAJOR ADVANCE HAS BEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)-GUIDED AND MONITORED, ROBOTICALLY CONTROLLED LASER PROBES FOR INTRA-TUMORAL THERMAL TREATMENTS (E.G., LASER INTERSTITIAL THERMAL THERAPY [LITT]). LITT IS INCREASINGLY USED TO TREAT DEEP-SEATED, UNRESECTABLE TUMORS THROUGH BOTH DIRECT THERMAL ABLATION AND PRIMING TO SENSITIZE THE TUMOR TO RADIATION. SUCH THERMAL PRIMING OF SOLID TUMORS, INCLUDING GBM, HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR DECADES TO INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF RADIATION TREATMENT.

THE PTP\u039c- TARGETED AGENTS WE DEVELOPED BIND TO THIS BIOMARKER AND RECOGNIZE HUMAN BRAIN TUMORS AS WELL AS INVASIVE PRIMARY BREAST CANCER AND BREAST CANCER THAT HAS METASTASIZED TO THE BRAIN. SYSTEMIC DELIVERY OF THE PTP\u039c- TARGETED AGENT RESULTS IN BINDING TO TUMOR CELLS WITHIN MINUTES IN XENOGRAFT MODELS. USING A 3D CRYO-IMAGING SYSTEM WE ANALYZED THE EXTENT OF CELL MIGRATION AND DISPERSAL WITHIN THE BRAIN. WE FOUND THAT THE PTP\u039c-TARGETED AGENT LABELS 99% OF ALL DISPERSING TUMOR CELLS FAR AWAY FROM THE MAIN TUMOR MASS ON NERVES IN MOUSE MODELS. THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS THE CONVERGENCE OF OUR EXPERTISE IN NEUROSCIENCE, CELL ADHESION, IMAGING AND CANCER TO TEST IF THE PTP\u039c BIOMARKER CAN BE USED TO DETECT TUMOR GROWTH ALONG NERVES LEADING TO BRAIN METASTASES.  GOLD NANOPARTICLES (AUNPS) HAVE SHOWN OUTSTANDING VERSATILITY IN BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDING IMAGING DIAGNOSTICS, DRUG DELIVERY, AND RADIATION THERAPY. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THERANOSTIC AUNPS FOR THE DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER METASTASES. WE WILL ACHIEVE MORE SENSITIVE DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF INVASIVE AND METASTATIC LESIONS THROUGH THE USE OF A THREE COMPONENT THERANOSTIC NANOPARTICLE CONTAINING: 1) A HIGHLY SPECIFIC TARGETING AGENT OF THE PTP\u039c BIOMARKER IN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT; 2) A PROTEASE-SENSITIVE QUENCHED NEAR INFRARED FLUOROPHORE FOR FLUORESCENT IMAGING; AND 3) A GOLD NANOPARTICLE (AUNP) FOR SENSITIZATION TO RADIOTHERAPY. WE WILL TEST WHETHER THE PTP\u039c-TARGETED AGENTS DETECTS NERVE ASSOCIATED GROWTH USING 3D SINGLE CELL RESOLUTION CRYO-IMAGING THAT PRECISELY TRACKS MIGRATION OF INDIVIDUAL CANCER CELLS ON NERVES. WE WILL UTILIZE OUR ESTABLISHED HUMAN PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFT MODELS OF METASTATIC BREAST CANCER AND MODELS THAT METASTASIZE FROM THE BREAST TO THE BRAIN. METASTATIC TUMORS ARE RESISTANT TO ALMOST ALL CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS SO \u201cPHYSICAL\u201d KILLING STRATEGIES LIKE RADIATION MUST BE IMPROVED AND EMPLOYED FOR BETTER THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES. BY DELIVERING PTP\u039c-TARGETED CONJUGATED AUNPS DIRECTLY TO PRIMARY AND METASTATIC BREAST CANCER WE WILL EXPLOIT THE RADIOSENSITIZATION OF AUNP TO REDUCE THE REQUIRED DOSE OF RADIATION NEEDED FOR RADIOTHERAPY THEREBY REDUCING COLLATERAL DAMAGE TO NORMAL SURROUNDING TISSUES.

THESE SIGNATURES RECAPITULATE THE DOWNSTREAM ONCOGENIC PATHWAYS UNDERLYING DRIVER GENOMIC EVENTS, AND IMPORTANTLY, CAN CAPTURE PATHWAY DE-REGULATION CAUSED BY OTHER MECHANISMS.

ADDITIONALLY, THESE TECHNIQUES CAN BE PROBLEMATIC DUE TO MODALITY AND CONTRAST AGENT CONTRAINDICATIONS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CECT AND CEMRI, CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASOUND (CEUS) HAS GAINED ACCEPTANCE FOR A VARIETY OF CLINICAL APPLICATIONS. IN SMALL PILOT STUDIES, OUR GROUP HAS DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY OF CEUS TO MONITOR FOR BOTH RESIDUAL AND RECURRENT RCC FOLLOWING PERCUTANEOUS ABLATION WITH 100% SENSITIVITY AND NO ADVERSE EVENTS. WHILE ENCOURAGING, OUR FINDINGS WERE BASED ON A RELATIVELY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND, WITH AN OVERALL SPECIFICITY OF THE TECHNIQUE THAT RANGED FROM 75-96%, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INABILITY TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY THE BOUNDARIES OF THE ABLATION CAVITY FROM THE SURROUNDING RENAL CORTEX.

ICB IS THE MOST WIDESPREAD CLASS OF IMMUNOTHERAPIES BUT IT POSES A NEW CHALLENGE TO ASSESS TUMOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE. ICB INDUCES INFILTRATIONS OF TILS INTO TUMORS TO KILL CANCER, BUT SUCH INCREASED NUMBERS OF TILS MAY LEAD TO TRANSIENT TUMOR ENLARGEMENT, WHICH IS THE CURRENT INDICATOR OF TUMOR PROGRESSION I.E., NON-RESPONDERS. THEREFORE, EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO ICB COULD BE MISDIAGNOSED AS TUMOR PROGRESSION I.E., PSEUDO-PROGRESSION. THERE IS OFTEN A MUCH LONGER WAITING PERIOD THAN CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS TO VERIFY THE PERSISTENCE OF TUMOR VOLUME CHANGES, WHICH PREVENTS TIMELY ADJUSTMENTS OF TREATMENT PLANS PARTICULARLY IN NON-RESPONDER PATIENTS, CAUSING UNWANTED TREATMENT DELAYS, COSTS, AND RISKS OF TOXICITY. CURRENT MAINSTREAM IMAGING METHODS REQUIRE EXOGENOUS AGENTS FOR LABELING TILS, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES COST AND RISKS OF TOXICITY. TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS, THIS APPLICATION PROPOSES A NOVEL, EXOGENOUS-AGENT-FREE APPROACH FOR IMAGING TILS. BECAUSE LYMPHOCYTES (5-10 \u039cM IN DIAMETER WITH AND WITHOUT ACTIVATION) ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN MOST CANCER CELLS (10-20 \u039cM), CELL SIZE COULD BE USED AS AN ENDOGENOUS CONTRAST TO DISTINGUISH \u201cSMALL\u201d TILS FROM \u201cLARGE\u201d CANCER CELLS. THE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED TILS ARE EXPECTED TO CAUSE SOME UNIQUE MICROSTRUCTURAL CHANGES E.G., DECREASED MEAN CELL SIZES AND INCREASED CELL FRACTIONS OF \u201cSMALL\u201d CELLS. TO DETECT THESE CHANGES, WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A CELL-SIZE-BASED MRI METHOD DUBBED MRI-CYTOMETRY FOR IMAGING CELL SIZE DISTRIBUTION AND INTRACELLULAR VOLUME FRACTIONS IN VIVO.

HOWEVER, SURVIVAL OUTCOMES VARY WIDELY, EVEN AMONG PATIENTS WITH DISEASE OF THE SAME STAGE. CERTAIN PATIENTS WITH EARLY-STAGE DISEASE HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY LOW RISK OF RECURRENCE AND MAY NOT BENEFIT FROM, OR COULD EVEN BE HARMED BY, CHEMOTHERAPY GIVEN THE ASSOCIATED TOXICITY AND SIDE EFFECTS.

IN AIM 2, WE WILL DEVELOP A SIMILAR TWO-AGENT MRF METHOD TO SIMULTANEOUSLY DETECT A PH-DEPENDENT T1 CONTRAST AGENT AND A PH-INDEPENDENT T2 CONTRAST AGENT TO MEASURE EXTRACELLULAR PH (PHE) IN TUMOR MODELS. WE WILL APPLY OUR PHE-MRF APPROACH TO MONITOR CHANGES IN TUMOR PHE AFTER ADMINISTERING TREATMENTS THAT RAISE AND LOWER TUMOR ACIDOSIS TO VALIDATE OUR METHODOLOGY.  OUR DELIVERABLE FOR THIS PROJECT IS A NEW ADAPTABLE, DYNAMIC 3D MRF APPROACH TO QUANTITATIVE MEASURE ONE OR TWO MRI CONTRAST AGENTS IN VIVO.

HUNDREDS OF NOVEL REGIMENS ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO OVERCOME PRIMARY AND ACQUIRED RESISTANCE. SOME COMBINATIONS INCREASE THE INFILTRATION OF CYTOTOXIC T CELLS IN THE TUMOR TO KILL CANCER CELLS, WHILE OTHERS MODULATE TUMOR-ASSOCIATED MACROPHAGES (TAMS) TO ENHANCE THE T CELL ACTIVITY IN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT.

NON-INVASIVE IMAGING TECHNIQUES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE RESPONSE TO COMBINATION THERAPY TO SAVE POTENTIAL NON-RESPONDERS FROM UNNECESSARY TOXICITY. CURRENT IMAGING TECHNIQUES DO NOT ASSESS THE DYNAMIC CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF T CELLS AND TAMS AT THE SAME TIME.

IN MANY LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS) BREAST CANCER IS DIAGNOSED AT ADVANCED STAGES. MANY WOMEN PRESENT WITH A PALPABLE BREAST MASS, WHICH IS RARE IN COMMUNITIES WHERE BREAST SCREENING IS AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION TO LIMITED IMAGING FACILITIES, PROLONGED DIAGNOSTIC DELAYS (76-630 DAYS) DUE IN PART TO THE EXTREME SHORTAGE OF PATHOLOGISTS (AS FEW AS 1 PER MILLION/POPULATION) CONTRIBUTE TO A 5-YEAR MORTALITY RATE UP TO 4 TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT IN THE US. AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM COULD BE AN AFFORDABLE, EASILY DEPLOYABLE MOLECULAR TEST TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE WOMEN LIKELY TO HAVE A MALIGNANCY FOR EXPEDITED BIOPSY AND PATHOLOGY REVIEW. IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER IMPROVES SURVIVAL. WITH OUR INDUSTRIAL PARTNER, CEPHEID, WE PROPOSE TO BUILD ON OUR PUBLISHED BREAST CANCER DETECTION PROTOTYPE TO DEVELOP AN AFFORDABLE, <3- HOUR, AUTOMATED BREAST CANCER DETECTION (ABCD) ASSAY THAT ANALYZES A PANEL OF HYPERMETHYLATED GENES IN BREAST FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATES (FNAS).THE PROPOSED INNOVATIONS WILL CUT THE ASSAY TIME IN HALF, AND REDUCE COSTS BY AT LEAST 3-FOLD TO PROVIDE A SINGLE-CARTRIDGE ASSAY FOR QUICK CANCER DETECTION. IN AIM 1A, WE WILL OPTIMIZE THE OFFBOARD BISULFITE-MEDIATED DNA CONVERSION METHOD AND TEST ITS EFFICIENCY IN PATIENT SET 1 FNAS (N= 29 MALIGNANT, 25 BENIGN). IN AIM 1B WE WILL SELECT ONE OPTIMAL 5-MARKER PANEL AND TEST ITS PERFORMANCE USING FIRST, THE GOLD STANDARD, FFPE SAMPLES (N= 30 MALIGNANT, 30 BENIGN), AND THEN, PATIENT SET 2 FNAS (N=35 MALIGNANT, 35 BENIGN). IN AIM 1C, WE WILL PERFORM TECHNICAL VALIDATION OF THE ABCD ASSAY. INTRA-ASSAY REPRODUCIBILITY WILL BE ASSESSED ON MULTIPLE SAMPLE COLLECTIONS OF PATIENT SET 3 FNAS (N=30 MALIGNANT, 30 BENIGN). INTER-OPERATOR REPRODUCIBILITY WILL BE DETERMINED USING REPLICATE FNA SLIDES FROM PATIENT SET 2 (N= 35 MALIGNANT, 35 BENIGN). THE GOAL OF AIM 2A IS TO PERFORM CLINICAL VALIDATION OF THE ABCD ASSAY. WE WILL FIRST SELECT A THRESHOLD IN A TRAINING SET OF FNAS: PATIENT SET 4 (N=100 MALIGNANT, 100 BENIGN) TO OPTIMALLY BALANCE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY, AND VALIDATE PERFORMANCE OF THE SELECTED THRESHOLD IN A TEST SET OF FNAS: PATIENT SET 5 (N= 180 MALIGNANT, 180 BENIGN). WE WILL MEASURE THE ACCURACY (SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AND POSITIVE- AND NEGATIVE-PREDICTIVE VALUE) OF ABCD-BASED DIAGNOSIS TO DISTINGUISH BENIGN VERSUS MALIGNANT LESIONS USING HISTOPATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS OF THE CORE BIOPSY AS THE GOLD STANDARD.

FROM CLINICAL TRIAL DATA IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY EVIDENT THAT A SINGLE BIOMARKER IS UNLIKELY TO CAPTURE THE SCOPE AND BREADTH OF CLINICAL RESPONSES TO ICT. RATHER, INCORPORATION OF MULTIPLE BIOMARKER PANELS, INCLUDING BOTH PHARMACODYNAMIC AND PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS, HAS BECOME A NECESSITY. HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF TESTS THAT CAN BE PERFORMED WITH BASELINE AND ON-TREATMENT BIOPSIES IS LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT OF BIOPSY TISSUE, AND HAS SEVERAL SHORTCOMINGS INCLUDING INTER- AND INTRA-TUMORAL HETEROGENEITY AND SAMPLING ERRORS. THOSE PROBLEMS ARE COMPOUNDED IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC DISEASE AND DIFFICULT-TO-ACCESS LOCATIONS. IMAGING METHODS SUCH AS POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) ENABLE REPETITIVE EVALUATION OF THE WHOLE BODY AND FACILITATE REAL-TIME QUANTIFICATION OF PHARMACODYNAMIC EFFECTS.

SEVERAL LARGE POPULATION STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT CUMULATIVE RADIATION DOSES FROM CT SCANS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE RISK OF CHILDREN DEVELOPING LEUKEMIA, THYROID CANCER, AND BRAIN CANCER LATER IN LIFE. THUS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO REDUCE THE RADIATION EXPOSURE OF CHILDREN CAUSED BY MEDICAL IMAGING PROCEDURES. TO THIS END, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A RADIATION-FREE IMAGING TEST FOR PEDIATRIC TUMOR STAGING, BASED ON ADVANCED WHOLE BODY DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (WB-DW MRI) TECHNOLOGY. OUR TEAM WAS THE FIRST TO INTEGRATE TUMOR PHYSIOLOGY INFORMATION (PROTON DIFFUSION) WITH AN MRI TECHNIQUE FOR ANATOMICAL ORIENTATION (NANOPARTICLE- ENHANCED T1-WEIGHTED MRI), BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF INTEGRATED PET/CT SCANS (LANCET ONCOLOGY). WHILE DW MRI HAS DEMONSTRATED HIGH SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FOR CANCER DETECTION, THE VALUE OF DW MRI FOR CANCER THERAPY MONITORING IN CHILDREN HAS NOT YET BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED.

PREVIOUS COMPARISONS OF WB-DW MRI AND 18F-FDG PET FOR CANCER THERAPY MONITORING HAVE BEEN INCONCLUSIVE, POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE SCANS WERE NOT OBTAINED AT THE SAME TIME. THUS, APPARENT DIFFERENCES MAY BE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF THE SCAN. WE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURING THERAPY-INDUCED CHANGES IN TUMOR METABOLISM AND DIFFUSION IN CHILDREN.

THESE \u039cPTMS PROVIDE A POWERFUL MODEL OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS\u2019 TUMOR AND ARE USED IN DRUG DISCOVERY, CANCER RESEARCH, AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE. HOWEVER, A CRITICAL HURDLE REMAINS THAT, UNLIKE XENOTRANSPLANTED TUMORS, \u039cPTMS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING TOOLS USED IN ONCOLOGY. THERE IS A DEARTH OF QUANTITATIVE IMAGING METHODS THAT CAN BE APPLIED SEAMLESSLY ACROSS PHYSICAL SCALES, RANGING FROM IN VITRO CELL CULTURES TO ANIMAL MODELS AND CANCER PATIENTS.

BUT THIS TRADITIONAL METHOD HAS BEEN QUESTIONED ON WHETHER IT PROVIDES INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WITH THE OPTIMAL TREATMENT. TO BETTER FIND A MATCHING TREATMENT INDIVIDUALLY, A CONCEPT CALLED PRECISION CANCER MEDICINE OR PERSONALIZED CANCER MEDICINE HAS BEEN STUDIED. AMONG OTHER APPROACHES, FUNCTIONAL PRECISION MEDICINE DIRECTLY TESTS CHEMOTHERAPY OPTIONS ON TUMOR CELLS BIOPSIED FROM A PATIENT TO FIND THE BEST MATCHING TREATMENT FOR THE SPECIFIC PATIENT. THIS PROMISING APPROACH, HOWEVER, HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED BY CLINICIANS BECAUSE THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT IN A LAB DIFFERED FROM THE ONE WITHIN THE PATIENT\u2019S BODY, LEADING TO INCONSISTENT DRUG RESPONSES BETWEEN THE SAMPLE AND PATIENT, AND THE QUANTITY OF BIOPSIED CELLS IS GENERALLY INSUFFICIENT FOR A RELIABLE NUMBER OF OPTIONS TO BE TESTED. THE FIRST PROBLEM IS BEING ADDRESSED BY RECENT ADVANCES IN THREE- DIMENSIONAL (3D) CELL CULTURE TECHNIQUES, WHICH BETTER MIMIC THE BODY\u2019S MICROENVIRONMENT IN A LAB. BUT THE SECOND PROBLEM, THE LIMITED NUMBER OF TESTABLE OPTIONS, IS MAINLY DUE TO LIMITATIONS IN THE CURRENT ASSAY TECHNIQUES THAT ASSESS CHEMOSENSITIVITY IN 3D CULTURE. WITH MOST CURRENT ASSAYS, A SAMPLE CAN ONLY BE TESTED ONCE, AND MULTIPLE DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF ACTION CANNOT BE SIMULTANEOUSLY TESTED BY A SINGLE ASSAY. COMBINED, THESE LIMITATIONS EXPONENTIALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TESTABLE OPTIONS WHEN INVOLVING MULTIPLE ASSESSMENT TIME POINTS TO DESIGN A SEQUENTIAL THERAPY OR WHEN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF DRUGS TO TEST A COMBINATION THERAPY. HERE, WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF CHEMOSENSITIVITY IN 3D CULTURE, BY MAXIMIZING THE POTENTIAL OF A LABEL-FREE 3D MICROSCOPY TECHNOLOGY, CALLED OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY (OCT). THE MAJORITY OF PRIOR OCT RESEARCH MEASURED ONLY ONE OR TWO TYPES OF SIGNALS AND SHOWED THE SIGNALS CORRESPONDING TO ONLY A SINGLE TYPE OF CELL VIABILITY DISRUPTION PROCESS IN EACH STUDY. BUT THIS APPROACH HAS LED TO A CONCERN ABOUT SPECIFICITY (I.E., OTHER TYPES OF PROCESSES THAN THE ONE TESTED IN THE STUDY CAN GENERATE SIMILAR OCT SIGNALS). THIS LOW SPECIFICITY, ALONG WITH UNCLEAR MECHANISMS OF VIABILITY ASSESSMENT, HAVE PREVENTED OCT METHODS FROM BEING ADOPTED FOR THE PROMISING CONCEPT OF FUNCTIONAL PRECISION MEDICINE.

ALTHOUGH DCIS SURVIVAL RATES APPROACH 100%, THERE IS CONCERN THAT ITS MANAGEMENT GENERALLY RESULTS IN OVERTREATMENT, EXPOSING MANY OF THE 50,000 U.S. WOMEN DIAGNOSED EACH YEAR TO UNNECESSARY ANXIETY AND MORBIDITY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF DCIS IS DETECTED IN ASYMPTOMATIC WOMEN IN WHOM SUSPICIOUS CALCIFICATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED ON MAMMOGRAPHY AND CHARACTERIZED USING LIMITED TISSUE HISTOPATHOLOGY. UNFORTUNATELY, CONVENTIONAL IMAGING AND PATHOLOGY HAVE NOT PROVEN RELIABLE FOR DISTINGUISHING LOW VS. HIGH-RISK DCIS. SPECIFICALLY, IT IS UNCLEAR AT DIAGNOSIS WHICH FORMS OF DCIS WILL UPSTAGE TO INVASIVE DISEASE OR HAVE AN IPSILATERAL BREAST RECURRENCE (IBR) AFTER TREATMENT. THIS LIMITED RISK-STRATIFICATION IS DUE IN PART TO INADEQUATE SAMPLING OF THE ENTIRE DCIS LESION AND AN INABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR PERITUMORAL MICROENVIRONMENT FEATURES. THIS RESULTS IN UNNECESSARY SURGERY, RADIATION THERAPY, AND MEDICAL THERAPY FOR AS MANY AS HALF OF WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH DCIS. BREAST MRI IS COMMONLY AND EASILY PERFORMED, ABLE TO BEST DEPICT DCIS SPAN, AND CAN ASSESS TUMOR AND PERITUMORAL HETEROGENEITY ROOTED IN BIOLOGICAL FEATURES SUCH AS ANGIOGENESIS, MAKING IT AN APPEALING CHOICE FOR A RADIOMICS ASSAY TO IMPROVE DCIS RISK ASSESSMENTS.

HOWEVER, PROGNOSTICATION VIA GLEASON GRADING SUFFERS FROM SEVERAL SHORTCOMINGS, INCLUDING SUBJECTIVE VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF COMPLEX 3D GLANDULAR MORPHOLOGIES BASED ON 2D IMAGES, AND ANALYSIS OF A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TISSUE (~1% OF THE BIOPSY). THESE SHORTCOMINGS CONTRIBUTE TO POOR INTER-OBSERVER CONCORDANCE AMONGST PATHOLOGISTS AND POOR STRATIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH INDOLENT VS. LETHAL DISEASE. FOR THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF PCA, TWO MAJOR CHALLENGES FACED BY UROLOGISTS AND ONCOLOGISTS, RESPECTIVELY, ARE: (1) CORRECTLY IDENTIFYING MEN WITH LOW-RISK PCA FOR ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE AND (2) IDENTIFYING MEN WHO ARE LIKELY TO HAVE DISEASE RECURRENCE AND METASTASIS AFTER CURATIVE THERAPY (SURGERY OR RADIATION), AND HENCE WOULD BENEFIT FROM ADJUVANT THERAPY.

LEFT UNTREATED, MRD CAN PROLIFERATE AND RESULT IN LETHAL CANCER RECURRENCE. HENCE, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO SENSITIVELY DETECT MRD IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE ADJUVANT THERAPIES OR PRECISION IMMUNOTHERAPY. LIQUID BIOPSY OFFERS THE ABILITY TO NONINVASIVELY MONITOR MRD BY DETECTING CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA (CTDNA) ORIGINATING FROM CANCER CELLS. NONETHELESS, DETECTION OF CTDNA IS CHALLENGING DUE TO EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS OF CTDNA IN LOW-BURDEN DISEASE. THE PREVAILING PARADIGM ARGUES FOR DEEP TARGETED SEQUENCING OF INFORMATIVE LOCI. HOWEVER, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS APPROACH FACES FUNDAMENTAL BARRIERS TO SENSITIVITY DUE TO THE LOW AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE DNA IN TYPICAL PLASMA SAMPLES, WHICH IMPOSES A PHYSICAL CEILING ON DEPTH OF SEQUENCING. TO OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE, OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF GENETICISTS, COMPUTER SCIENTISTS, AND ONCOLOGISTS DEVELOPED MRDETECT, AN ORTHOGONAL APPROACH FOR CTDNA DETECTION BASED ON GENOME-WIDE MUTATION AGGREGATION OF SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE VARIANTS (SNVS) AND COPY NUMBER VARIANTS (CNVS) USING WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING (WGS) OF PLASMA. MRDETECT ENABLES ULTRA-SENSITIVE MRD DETECTION DOWN TO ONE PART IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND, AND WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO DETECT MRD SHORTLY AFTER SURGERY OR TREATMENT IN COLORECTAL CANCER, MELANOMA AND NON SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC).

HUMAN ENDOGENOUS RETROVIRUSES (ERVS) ARE OFTEN ABERRANTLY EXPRESSED IN NUMEROUS DISEASE STATES, INCLUDING MALIGNANCY, AND CAN LEAD TO ACTIVATION OF BOTH INNATE IMMUNITY (THROUGH SENSING BY THE RIG-I/MDA-5 AND CGAS-STING PATHWAYS) AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY (BY PROVIDING ANTIGENIC TARGETS FOR TUMOR-SPECIFIC CD8+ T CELLS). THE EXPRESSION OF ERVE-4 HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONSE TO ICI MONOTHERAPY (I.E. ANTI-PD-1) IN AN ANALYSIS OF A PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IN RCC, AND AN ERV-DERIVED PEPTIDE (FROM ERVE-4) WAS IDENTIFIED AS A TARGET EPITOPE IN A LONG-TERM RCC RESPONDER TO ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT. BEYOND RECOGNITION OF TUMOR ANTIGENS, EFFECTIVE ANTI-TUMOR IMMUNITY REQUIRES A TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT THAT PERMITS INFILTRATING CD8+ T CELLS TO CARRY OUT THEIR EFFECTOR FUNCTION. A HIGH LEVEL OF TUMOR INFILTRATION BY ANTIGEN- EXPERIENCED, NON-EXHAUSTED CD8+ T CELLS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED RESPONSE TO ICI MONOTHERAPY IN CLINICAL TRIALS OF RCC.

A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO UNDERSTANDING AND TARGETING EOC IS THE HETEROGENEOUS NATURE OF THE DISEASE, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP TREATMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY TARGET AND DESTROY ALL CANCER CELLS. THIS HETEROGENEITY RESULTS IN COMPLICATED MOLECULAR LANDSCAPES WITH SUBPOPULATIONS OF HIGHLY INVASIVE AND CHEMORESISTANT TUMOR CELLS. IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HETEROGENEITY IN CANCER CELLS DEVELOPS AND CONTRIBUTES TO EOC DISEASE PROGRESSION. POLYPLOIDAL GIANT CANCER CELLS REPRESENT A SMALL SUBPOPULATION OF DRUG-RESISTANT AND DORMANT CANCER CELLS THAT SURVIVE TREATMENT AND LATER AWAKEN TO FORM NEW TUMOR CELLS THROUGH AMITOTIC BUDDING. SINGLE CELL BIOPHYSICAL ANALYSIS OF TUMOR ORGANOID CULTURES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE HOW POLYPLOIDAL GIANT CANCER CELLS AND OTHER INVASIVE CELLS CONTRIBUTE TO EOC DISEASE PROGRESSION. IN THE EOC TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT, CANCER CELLS FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTER METABOLIC STRESS FROM NUTRIENT DEPRIVATION, HYPOXIA, AND TOXIC THERAPEUTICS, WHICH CAN TRIGGER METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING TO PROMOTE CELL SURVIVAL. CELLS CAN UNDERGO A METABOLIC SHIFT FROM GLYCOLYSIS TO OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION TO MEET ENERGY DEMANDS OF SURVIVAL AND INVASIVENESS; THIS SHIFT IN METABOLISM HAS BEEN CORRELATED WITH HIGHLY ENERGETIC MITOCHONDRIA, LIPID DROPLET DISAPPEARANCE (LIPOLYSIS), AND AUTOPHAGY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN PGCCS, WHICH HAVE INCREASED NUTRIENT DEMANDS IN PART TO THEIR LARGER SIZE AND MORE INVASIVE PHENOTYPE. ADDITIONALLY, EOC METASTASES FORM FROM MULTICELLULAR AGGREGATES THAT ARE SHED FROM THE PRIMARY TUMOR INTO THE ADIPOCYTE-RICH ABDOMINAL CAVITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT PERITONEAL ADIPOCYTES CAN TRANSFER FREE FATTY ACIDS TO EOC CELLS TO PROVIDE CELLULAR ENERGY FOR METASTATIC TUMOR GROWTH. FATTY ACIDS PROVIDE A RICH ENERGY SOURCE FOR ATP-DEPENDENT ACTIN POLYMERIZATION AND ACTIN-BASED PROTRUSIONS ARE CRITICAL FOR CELL MIGRATION AND DURING METASTASIS.

A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF GBM TUMORS IS THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THESE LESIONS AS TUMOR RECURRENCE OR BENIGN TREATMENT-RELATED RADIATION EFFECTS (TRRE). THESE CONDITIONS MIMIC EACH OTHER, CLINICALLY AND RADIOGRAPHICALLY. UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE ABSENCE OF RELIABLE DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, PATIENTS WITH TRRE WILL UNDERGO AN UNNECESSARY AND AVOIDABLE INVASIVE STEREOTACTIC BRAIN BIOPSY (ST-BX) FOR CONFIRMATION OF DISEASE ABSENCE. HOWEVER, EVEN THE INVASIVE ST-BX HAS AN ACCURACY OF 85-90% DUE TO SAMPLING ERRORS ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING A BIOPSY TISSUE WHICH MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNDERLYING DISEASE PATHOLOGY.

OUR GROUP HAS DEVELOPED A NEW IMAGE-BASED RECURRENCE RISK CLASSIFIER (IRRISC) USING ROUTINE MRI SCANS, THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED AN ACCURACY OF 85% IN DISTINGUISHING TUMOR RECURRENCE FROM TRRE, ON N=58 STUDIES. OUR INITIAL SET OF IRRISC FEATURES COMPRISE DISORDER IN GRADIENT ORIENTATIONS ON GADOLINIUM (GD)-T1W MRI WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN TUMOR RECURRENCE COMPARED TO TRRE.

SURGERY IS THE MAIN TREATMENT OPTION FOR THESE PATIENTS AND CAN BE CURATIVE IF TUMORS ARE COMPLETELY REMOVED.

ZWITTERIONIC (I.E., CHARGE-BALANCED) DYES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION AND HAVE OUTPERFORMED IR800 COUNTERPARTS IN COMPARATIVE STUDIES. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF DYE CHARGE ON IN VIVO PERFORMANCE, WE REPLACED IR800 WITH THE CHARGE-BALANCED NEAR-INFRARED FLUORESCENT DYE, FNIR-TAG, TO PRODUCE THE SECOND-GENERATION AGENT, MMC(FNIR-TAG)-TOC. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWED THAT MMC(FNIR-TAG)-TOC HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BACKGROUND SIGNAL THAN THE FIRST-GENERATION AGENT IN NEARLY ALL NORMAL TISSUES ALONG WITH HIGHER TUMOR UPTAKE.

IN THE PAST FEW DECADES, GREAT PROGRESS WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL FUNCTION OF A SMALL NUMBER OF A-TO-I EDITING SITES IN CANCER-RELATED GENES, MOST OF WHICH ALTER PROTEIN-CODING SEQUENCES. OWING TO THE RECENT ADVANCES IN RNA-SEQUENCING (RNA-SEQ) TECHNOLOGIES AND BIOINFORMATIC METHODOLOGIES, AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF A-TO-I EDITING SITES HAVE BEEN CATALOGED FOR VARIOUS ORGANISMS. IMPORTANTLY, WIDESPREAD ABERRANT RNA EDITING HAS BEEN REPORTED IN A NUMBER OF CANCER TYPES.

THE PAP TEST FIXATIVE AND SWABS ARE IDEAL FOR BIOMARKER DISCOVERY SINCE THEY ARE DERIVED FROM A SITE PROXIMAL TO THE OVARIAN CANCER (I.E. PROTEINS MAY BE SECRETED OR SHED FROM THE TUMOR AND FLOW THROUGH THE FALLOPIAN TUBE INTO THE UTERUS AND OUT THE CERVICAL OPENING).

NOTABLY, TARGETED DELIVERY OF THE THERANOSTIC IONPS INTO TUMORS PROMOTED INFILTRATION OF IMMUNE EFFECTOR CELLS AND DECREASED IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE CELLS, CONVERTING AN IMMUNE \u201cCOLD\u201d PANCREATIC TUMOR INTO A \u201cHOT\u201d TUMOR. WE FURTHER DEVELOPED AN ULTRASMALL IONP PD-L1 INHIBITOR (NANO-IPD-L1) USING AN ENGINEERED PD-L1 BLOCKING PEPTIDE. WE SHOWED THAT NANO-IPD-L1 SELECTIVELY ACCUMULATED IN PANCREATIC TUMORS FOLLOWING SYSTEMIC DELIVERY. CO-DELIVERY OF NANO-IPD-L1 WITH ATFMMP14-IONP/DRUG ENHANCED INTRATUMROAL DELIVERY AND SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED TUMOR GROWTH IN A MOUSE PANCREATIC CANCER MODEL. THEREFORE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT IMPROVED DRUG DELIVERY IN PANCREATIC TUMORS BY CO- ADMINISTRATIONS OF STROMA PENETRATING ATFMMP14-IONP/SN38 AND NANO-IPD-L1 LEADS TO A STRONG THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY THROUGH DIRECT TUMOR CELL KILLING, MODULATING IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE STROMA, AND BLOCKING PD-L1 FUNCTION TO GENERATE A STRONG RESPONSE FROM CYTOTOXIC T CELLS.

PDAC IS THE FOURTH LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER- RELATED DEATHS IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES DESPITE ITS LOW INCIDENCE RATE. THE 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE FOR ALL STAGES OF PDAC IS 10% BUT CAN BE AS HIGH AS 50% WITH EARLY-STAGE DIAGNOSIS. THEREFORE, IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH RISK FOR PDAC HAS HIGH CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AS FOLLOW-UP IMAGING EXAMINATIONS OR BIOPSY MAY ASSIST IN EARLY DETECTION AND ALLOW SURGICAL INTERVENTION WHILE THE TUMORS ARE STILL RESECTABLE. HOWEVER, PDAC PREDICTION IS DIFFICULT DUE TO THE LACK OF RELIABLE SCREENING TOOLS, THE ABSENCE OF SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS AND BIOMARKERS, AND LOW PREVALENCE.  ABDOMINAL PAIN IS THE SINGLE MOST COMMON REASON THAT AMERICANS VISIT THE EMERGENCY ROOM (ER), WHERE AN ABDOMINAL COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCAN IS USUALLY PERFORMED. EVEN THOUGH MOST SCANS DON\u2019T SHOW ANY SIGNS OF CANCER VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYES OF RADIOLOGISTS, SOME SUBJECTS EVENTUALLY DEVELOP PDAC IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THESE PRE-DIAGNOSTIC CT IMAGES PROVIDE CRITICAL MORPHOLOGICAL INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH BIOLOGICAL CHANGES AT THE PRE-CANCER OR EARLY CANCER STAGE, WHICH CAN BE EXTRACTED USING AI TO PREDICT PDAC RISK. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO UNCOVER UNIQUE FEATURES IN PRE-DIAGNOSTIC IMAGES USING AI AND DEVELOP PDAC PREDICTION MODEL BASED ON THESE FEATURES. NON-IMAGING FACTORS SUCH AS DEMOGRAPHIC, EPIDEMIOLOGIC, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC FACTORS, CLINICAL COMORBIDITIES, AND LABORATORY TESTS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE MODEL TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTION ACCURACY. THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESES ARE A) AI ALLOWS EXTRACTION OF UNIQUE IMAGE FEATURES IN PRE-DIAGNOSTIC CT IMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PRE-CANCER OR EARLY CANCER BIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT ARE INVISIBLE TO NAKED EYES AND B) THE COMBINATION OF PRE-DIAGNOSTIC IMAGE FEATURES AND NON- IMAGING FACTORS IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF PDAC RISK STRATIFICATION AND PREDICTION OVER THAT USING CONVENTIONAL NON-IMAGING FACTORS ALONE. TO VERIFY THESE HYPOTHESES, WE WILL RETROSPECTIVELY EVALUATE CT PANCREATIC IMAGES OBTAINED UP TO 3 YEARS PRIOR TO PDAC DIAGNOSIS THAT WERE DEEMED NON-CANCEROUS BY RADIOLOGISTS. A GROUP OF SUBJECTS WHO UNDERWENT SIMILAR IMAGING STUDIES FOR NON-GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS AND WERE AGE/GENDER MATCHED WITH PRE-DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING WILL SERVE AS HEALTHY CONTROLS. ACCURATELY STRATIFYING HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS MAY ALLOW FOR EARLY DETECTION OF PDAC IN THE FUTURE. A MAJOR CHALLENGE OF THE PROJECT IS THE SCARCITY OF THE APPROPRIATE IMAGING DATA BECAUSE OF THE LOW PREVALENCE OF PDAC AND STRINGENT ENROLLMENT CRITERIA.

HOWEVER, ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE PATIENTS RESPOND TO TREATMENT, TYPICALLY THOSE WITH PROGRAMMED DEATH LIGAND 1 (PD-L1)-POSITIVE TUMORS, WHILE A MAJORITY EXPERIENCE SERIOUS DRUG RELATED SIDE EFFECTS. THE EFFICIENT SELECTION OF LIKELY RESPONDERS TO IMMUNOTHERAPY IS LIMITED BY THE FACT THAT BIOPSY, THE CURRENT SCREENING STANDARD FOR PD-L1 EXPRESSION, PROVIDES ONLY A SNAPSHOT OF BIOMARKER STATUS AT A SINGLE TIME POINT, WHILE IT IS KNOWN THAT PD-L1 EXPRESSION CAN DYNAMICALLY CHANGE DURING THERAPY. ADDITIONALLY, TUMOR VASCULAR \u201cNORMALIZATION\u201d INDICATORS, SUCH AS PERFUSION, HYPOXIA AND ANGIOGENESIS CAN DYNAMICALLY CHANGE DURING TREATMENT, POTENTIALLY SERVING AS EARLY INDICATORS OF TREATMENT EFFICACY. THERE IS THEREFORE AN URGENT NEED FOR NON-INVASIVE IMAGING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN LONGITUDINALLY QUANTIFY MOLECULAR AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PREDICTIVE TUMOR BIOMARKERS BEFORE AND DURING TREATMENT. SUCH TECHNIQUES CAN POTENTIALLY SAVE NON-RESPONDERS FROM INEFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND LIFE-THREATENING EFFECTS AND CAN ALSO FACILITATE A ROBUST EVALUATION OF NEW COMBINATION THERAPIES THAT IMPROVE SURVIVAL AND PROVE EFFECTIVE IN A LARGER PATIENT POPULATION.

FURTHER CONJUGATION OF BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES, SUCH AS PROTEINS, NUCLEIC ACIDS, AND LIPIDS, CONFERS SPECIFIC TARGETING OF THESE INPS TO DESIRED TISSUES IN VIVO. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF SOME INPS CAN BE HARNESSED FOR THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES. STILL, SPONTANEOUS STIMULATION OF INTRINSIC THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS THROUGH INTERACTIONS OF THE NPS WITH INTRACELLULAR ORGANELLES, PROTEINS, OR MOLECULAR PROCESSES IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL, LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT OFF-TARGET TOXICITY. AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPEUTIC APPROACH IS TO TRANSFORM SOME INPS INTO NANOSCALE ENERGY TRANSDUCERS. QUANTUM DOTS, UPCONVERSION NPS, CARBON NANOMATERIALS, AND PHOTOCATALYTIC NPS ARE SOME NANOSCALE ENERGY TRANSDUCERS THAT HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN THE TREATMENT OF HUMAN DISEASES. THE EXCELLENT REDOX PROPERTIES OF THESE NANOPHOTOSENSITIZERS OFFER HIGH SPATIOTEMPORAL CONTROL AND PRECISION PHOTOTHERAPY UPON ABSORPTION OF LIGHT. TWO MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT PHOTOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS ARE THE LIMITED PENETRATION OF LIGHT USED TO ACTIVATE THE PHOTOSENSITIZERS, WHICH CONFINES THERAPY TO SHALLOW LESIONS, AND THE FREQUENT RELIANCE ON MOLECULAR OXYGEN TO GENERATE CYTOTOXIC REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES, A CONDITION THAT PRECLUDES THE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT UNDER THE HYPOXIC CONDITIONS FOUND IN MANY SOLID AND HEMATOLOGIC TUMORS.

IN THE PRESENT PROPOSAL, WE SEEK TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE CHALLENGES BY DEVELOPING A NEW TYPE OF HGSC SCREENING ASSAY CALLED PAPDREAM THAT IS BASED ON THE SENSITIVE, COST-EFFECTIVE DETECTION OF A NOVEL SET OF EPIGENETIC BIOMARKERS THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN TO BE PREVALENTLY AND SPECIFICALLY HYPERMETHYLATED IN BOTH EARLY, PRECURSOR (STIC) LESIONS AND LATER-STAGE HGSC TUMORS. THE PAPDREAM ASSAY WILL EMPLOY A UNIQUE, DIGITAL METHYLATION ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE CALLED \u039c-DREAMING (MICROFLUIDIC DISCRIMINATION OF RARE EPIALLELES BY MELT) THAT PROVIDES A SIMPLE, BUT HIGHLY-EFFECTIVE MEANS OF DETECTING AND QUANTIFYING RARE, ABERRANTLY- METHYLATED DNA, EVEN IN CHALLENGING SAMPLES SUCH AS STOOL, LIQUID BIOPSIES AND PAP SPECIMENS. A USER- FRIENDLY WORKFLOW BASED ON COMMON LABORATORY INSTRUMENTATION WILL BE DEVELOPED TO ENABLE PAPDREAM TO BE READILY TRANSLATED AND PERFORMED IN VARIOUS RESEARCH AND CLINICAL SETTINGS AT A COST OF ONLY A FEW DOLLARS PER ASSAY. ULTIMATELY, THE PAPDREAM ASSAY CAN BE USED ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER ASSAYS TO PROVIDE AN IDEAL SCREENING METHOD FOR WOMEN AT HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING HGSC. WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM WITH COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE IN GYNECOLOGIC PATHOLOGY, ASSAY DEVELOPMENT AND DNA METHYLATION BIOINFORMATICS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL BY ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING AIMS: (1) EVALUATE AND PRIORITIZE METHYLATION BIOMARKERS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PAPDREAM ASSAY, (2) INCORPORATE \u039c- DREAMING ASSAYS INTO PAPDREAM: A SIMPLE, MULTIPLEXED DIGITAL METHYLATION ASSAY FOR THE DETECTION OF EARLY- STAGE HGSC, AND (3) ASSESS THE CLINICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE PAPDREAM ASSAY IN PAP SPECIMENS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01CA260628_7529"}, {"internal_id": 144559103, "Award ID": "R01CA260449", "Award Amount": 778973.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-12-14", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "EXPLOITING GOLD NANOPARTICLE AS A PROBE TO IDENTIFY THERAPEUTIC TARGETS - NANOPARTICLES (NPS) HAVE MOSTLY BEEN USED AS DELIVERY VEHICLES FOR VARIOUS BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS.

BECAUSE OVARIAN CANCER IS SO DEADLY, RISK-REDUCING SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY (RRSO) IS OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR WOMEN AT HIGH RISK; HOWEVER, RRSO HAS FERTILITY AND HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. IT IS NOW BELIEVED THAT OVARIAN HIGH-GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA (HGSC) MAY BEGIN IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBES (FTS) AS SEROUS TUBAL INTRAEPITHELIAL CARCINOMA (STIC), AND THAT PRECANCEROUS CHANGES ARE DETECTABLE BEFORE METASTASIS TO THE OVARY AND PERITONEAL CAVITY OCCURS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SERUM PROTEIN BIOMARKERS IN HGSC CASES 12-84 MONTHS PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS. FURTHER, WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT CHANGES OCCUR IN MULTISPECTRAL FLUORESCENCE IMAGE MARKERS OF NORMAL AND CANCEROUS OVARIES AND FTS, AND THAT WE CAN BUILD A THIN FALLOPOSCOPE SUITABLE FOR TRAVERSING THE UTERUS AND FT FOR IMAGING AND CELL COLLECTION.  WE WILL ADDRESS THE UNMET CLINICAL NEED FOR A MINIMALLY INVASIVE TEST FOR STIC AND EARLY (STAGE I/II) OVARIAN CANCER. CURRENTLY, NO METHODS ENABLE THE DETECTION OF OVARIAN HGSC WITH A LEAD TIME OF MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. OVERALL, OUR WORK WILL MEET THE NEED TO DETECT AGGRESSIVE CANCERS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE STAGE.

THIS IS A CRITICAL NEED BECAUSE PATIENTS WITH STAGE II AND III MELANOMA HAVE AN APPROXIMATE 30% CHANCE OF DYING OF MELANOMA OVER 10 YEARS. THERAPIES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO LESSEN RECURRENCE RISK, BUT THEY ARE TOXIC AND COSTLY. IDENTIFYING PATIENTS WHO HAVE TRULY BEEN CURED BY THE SURGERY AND ARE CANCER FREE WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY USEFUL TO GUIDE PATIENT CARE. IT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR DECADES THAT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM LIMITS MELANOMA PROGRESSION AND THAT HIGHER LEVELS OF TUMOR INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES (TILS) PORTEND A FAVORABLE OUTCOME. ASSESSMENT OF TILS, HOWEVER, INVOLVES A SUBJECTIVE DETERMINATION BY THE PATHOLOGIST USING QUALITATIVE CRITERIA AND THIS APPROACH IS PRONE TO INTER-OBSERVER VARIABILITY. ONE BARRIER TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS IN EARLY STAGE MELANOMA IS THAT THE TUMORS ARE TINY AND MOST DERMATO-PATHOLOGISTS REQUIRE THAT THE ENTIRE SAMPLE BE FORMALIN FIXED AND PARAFFIN EMBEDDED (FFPE) FOR CAREFUL MORPHOLOGY ANALYSIS. IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THIS BARRIER, OUR TEAM HAS DEVELOPED AND PUBLISHED THREE DIGITAL PATHOLOGY METHODS TO ESTIMATE RECURRENCE RISK. THESE BIOMARKERS ARE BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EVIDENCE OF STRONG IMMUNE SURVEILLANCE WITHIN THE TISSUE INDICATES LOWER RECURRENCE RISK AND INCLUDE QUANTITATION OF TILS USING DIGITAL SOFTWARE, STAINING FOR MACROPHAGES AND T CELLS USING QUANTITATIVE- IMMUNE-FLUORESCENCE (QIF), AND MEASUREMENT OF AN INTERFERON SIGNATURE USING NANOSTRING TECHNOLOGY. EACH OF THESE METHODS PROVIDES UNIQUE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TUMOR IMMUNE MICRO-ENVIRONMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, NANOSTRING PROVIDES GENOMIC INFORMATION BUT DOES NOT PROVIDE SPATIAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE LOCATIONS OF SPECIFIC CELL PHENOTYPES WITHIN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT AS QIF DOES. FOR INSTANCE, QIF REVEALED THE MACROPHAGES CONFER A POOR PROGNOSIS SPECIFICALLY WHEN LOCATED WITHIN THE TUMOR STROMA.

LIQUID BIOPSIES ARE POISED TO REVOLUTIONIZE CANCER THERAPIES, BY ENABLING FREQUENT BLOOD-BASED MONITORING OF TUMOR-DERIVED MATERIALS, AS CANCERS EVOLVE IN RESPONSE TO THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS. THE TECHNOLOGICAL HURDLE IN ISOLATING SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF RARE CTCS FROM ROUTINE BLOOD SPECIMENS HAS BEEN THE SINGLE MAJOR LIMITATION PREVENTING THE CLINICAL DEPLOYMENT OF CTC-BASED DIAGNOSTIC OPPORTUNITIES. ENABLED BY THE TECHNOLOGY PROPOSED HERE, OUR SHIFT FROM PROCESSING ROUTINE 10 ML BLOOD TUBES (0.2% OF WHOLE BLOOD VOLUME) TO MAKING USE OF CLINICAL LEUKAPHERESIS TO SAMPLE NEAR-WHOLE BLOOD VOLUMES (40-100%) ADDRESSES THIS CHALLENGE.

THE W-DIFC OPTICAL PROBE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING DESIGN WILL PERMIT DATA COLLECTION IN FREELY-MOVING MICE IN AMBIENT LIGHTING CONDITIONS. WE WILL FIRST USE W-DIFC TO STUDY CTC DYNAMICS DURING DISEASE DEVELOPMENT IN AN ORTHOTOPIC XENOGRAFT AND TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL OF METASTASIS.  WE WILL USE ALSO W-DIFC TO MEASURE CONTINUOUS CTC DYNAMICS AFTER RADIATION THERAPY IN A MEDULLOBLASTOMA (MB) MOUSE MODEL. MB IS A COMMON FORM OF CHILDHOOD BRAIN CANCER THAT AGGRESSIVELY METASTASIZES TO THE LEPTOMENINGEAL SURFACES OF THE BRAIN AND SPINE VIA THE PB. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE THAT RADIATION MAY EXACERBATE METASTASIS BY TRIGGERING MOBILIZATION OF CTCS INTO THE BLOOD. WE EXPECT THAT THE ABILITY OF W-DIFC TO MEASURE CTCS OVER SHORT-, MEDIUM-, AND LONG-TERM TIMESCALES WILL PROVIDE UNIQUE INSIGHTS INTO THIS PROCESS. WE WILL ALSO USE W-DIFC TO STUDY THE USE OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS TO BLOCK THE PRO-METASTATIC EFFECT. HENCE, THE STUDIES PROPOSED HERE COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF METASTASIS AND IMPROVED TREATMENT PROTOCOLS FOR CHILDHOOD MB.

ADVANCED EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER (EOC) IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN OVERALL SURVIVAL OF 30% BUT CAN BE CURED IN UP TO 90% OF CASES IF DIAGNOSED AT AN EARLY STAGE. THEREFORE, DEVELOPING NONINVASIVE AND HIGHLY SPECIFIC BLOOD-BASED TESTS IS HIGHLY APPEALING AS SCREENING METHODS IN CLINIC SETTINGS. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT HUMAN MICROBIOTA, A COLLECTION OF MICROORGANISMS THAT LIVE IN THE BODY, ARE HARBORED IN EOC TUMOR TISSUE THAT ARE DISTINCTLY UNIQUE BETWEEN WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT DISEASE. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE IF THESE OBSERVED MICROBIOTA DIFFERENCES CAN BE DETECTED OUTSIDE THE OVARIAN TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT AND SERVE AS BIOMARKERS OF EARLY DISEASE.

IN THIS CLASSIFICATION SCHEME, LESIONS RATED AS 4A HAVE AN EXPECTED PROBABILITY OF MALIGNANCY MORE THAN 2% AND UP TO 10% AND THOSE RATED AS 4B HAVE A PROBABILITY OF MALIGNANCY MORE THAN 10% AND UP TO 50%. A RECENT PUBLICATION EVALUATING THE POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE (PPV3) FOR 125,447 DIAGNOSTIC EXAMS COLLECTED IN THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY (ACR) NATIONAL MAMMOGRAPHY DATABASE (NMD) DEMONSTRATED THAT 88% OF BIOPSIES WERE PERFORMED ON BI-RADS 4A AND 4B LESIONS.

WHEN THE DISEASE CAN BE DIAGNOSED AT EARLY STAGE, THERE IS STRIKING SURVIVAL IMPROVEMENT (FIVE YEAR SURVIVAL = 90%), COMPARED TO LATE STAGES (= 40%). HOWEVER, CURRENTLY NO EARLY DETECTION METHOD FOR OVARIAN CANCER HAS ENOUGH ACCURACY, AND MOST TUMORS ALREADY PROGRESSED TO ADVANCED STAGES AT DIAGNOSIS. FURTHERMORE, OVER 70% OF THE ADNEXAL MASSES DETECTED ON PREOPERATIVE IMAGING ARE FOUND TO BE BENIGN AFTER PELVIC SURGERY. CURRENT CLINICAL TESTS RELY ON SERUM CA-125 AND SONOGRAMS TO DIAGNOSE THE OVARIAN ADNEXAL MASSES. HOWEVER, CA-125 IS ELEVATED BY MANY COMMON BENIGN CONDITIONS; AND ULTRASOUND IMAGING OF OVARY FREQUENTLY MISSES SMALL BUT MALIGNANT LESIONS. AS A RESULT, SURGICAL REMOVAL OF THE LESION AND HISTOLOGIC EVALUATION REMAINS THE ONLY GOLD STANDARD FOR DIAGNOSIS. THESE LIMITATIONS DICTATE AN URGENT CLINICAL NEED OF A BETTER PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSTIC METHOD WITH HIGH DETECTION ACCURACY, TO LOWER THE MORTALITY RATE, REDUCE UNNECESSARY SURGERIES AND PRESERVE THE LIFE CHOICES FOR MANY PATIENTS, ESPECIALLY YOUNG WOMEN AT REPRODUCTIVE AGE PLANNING FOR PREGNANCIES. HERE, WE PROPOSE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ROUTE TO DETECT OVARIAN CANCER SIGNALS FROM THE BLOOD T CELL REPERTOIRE. THIS IS FEASIBLE BECAUSE THE T LYMPHOCYTES RECOGNIZE TUMOR ANTIGENS AT INITIAL STAGES, PROLIFERATE AND ALTER THE PERIPHERAL T CELL REPERTOIRE. THEREFORE, DETECTION OF CANCER-ASSOCIATED T CELLS (CAT) IN THE BLOOD PROVIDES AN EXCITING NOVEL OPPORTUNITY FOR NON-INVASIVE CANCER DIAGNOSIS. HOWEVER, NO PRIOR STUDIES HAVE ACHIEVED THIS GOAL BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY CAT IN HIGH-THROUGHPUT, AS MOST OF THE CANCER ANTIGENS REMAIN UNKNOWN. TO PREPARE FOR THIS TASK, WE DEVELOPED THE SOFTWARE TRUST AND ISMART, TO OBTAIN ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC TCRS FROM CANCER DATASETS. THESE TOOLS HAVE ENABLED US TO PRODUCE A LARGE TRAINING SET OF CATS, WHICH ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY DIAGNOSTIC TCRS FOR THE OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS. FOLLOWING THIS RESULT, WE FURTHER DEVELOPED DEEPCAT, FOR PAN-CANCER PREDICTION USING BLOOD TCR SEQUENCING DATA, AND DEMONSTRATED OVER 99% SPECIFICITY AND 86% SENSITIVITY IN A PILOT STUDY TO PREDICT OVARIAN CANCER PATIENTS (N=14) FROM HEALTHY DONORS (N=176).

THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST INCREASED RISKS FOR THESE CANCERS DUE TO INCREASING EXTRINSIC (I.E., ENVIRONMENTAL AND LIFESTYLE) RISK FACTORS, WHICH, IF IDENTIFIED, CAN BE PREVENTED. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE DRAMATIC INCREASES IN THESE EARLY-ONSET CANCERS, THEIR RELATIVE RARITY COUPLED WITH A LONG INDUCTION TIME MAKE TRADITIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC APPROACHES INEFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING CAUSES. FOR EXAMPLE, A POPULATION SAMPLE OF MORE THAN 0.76 MILLION WOULD BE NEEDED TO OBSERVE 500 CASES OF COLORECTAL CANCER IN ADULTS UNDER 50 OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD. WE THUS PROPOSE TO UTILIZE A NOVEL, AND EFFICIENT, MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK TO INVESTIGATE DRIVERS OF THE THREE EARLY- ONSET CANCERS (I.E. COLORECTAL, THYROID, AND KIDNEY). THIS FRAMEWORK WILL USE MECHANISTIC MATHEMATICAL MODELS TO CAPTURE THE UNDERLYING CANCER BIOLOGY OVER THE LIFE COURSE, AND FURTHER COUPLE THESE MODELS WITH ADVANCED DATA ASSIMILATION METHODS TO TEST VARIOUS HYPOTHESIZED RISK MECHANISMS BASED ON CANCER INCIDENCE AND EXPOSURES RECORDED IN NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATASETS. THE PROJECT TEAM HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE USING DATA ASSIMILATION METHODS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS TO UNDERSTAND DISEASE SYSTEMS INCLUDING CANCERS. THE FRAMEWORK WILL ALSO INNOVATIVELY ACCOUNT FOR CHANGING CANCER DETECTION RATES OVER TIME, OBSERVATION ERRORS, INTERACTIONS AMONG MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS, AND CHANGES IN RISK IMPACT OVER THE LIFE COURSE. USING THIS NEW FRAMEWORK, FOR EACH OF THE THREE KEY CANCERS, WE AIM TO 1) SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE AND IDENTIFY KEY RISK FACTORS, IN PARTICULAR, IN YOUNGER ADULTS <50 YEARS, 2) INFER THE RISK MECHANISMS (E.G., CANCER INITIATION VS. PROMOTION), 3) EXAMINE THE DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS AMONG CO-EXPOSURES (E.G., RISK AMPLIFICATION DUE TO SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF CO- EXPOSURES), AND 4) QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS AND CO-EXPOSURES IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF LIFE AND PARTICULARLY TO EXAMINE CRITICAL WINDOWS OF SUSCEPTIBILITY. FURTHER, WE WILL QUANTIFY WHETHER THE IDENTIFIED ETIOLOGICAL FACTORS WHEN COMBINED ARE OF HIGH ENOUGH MAGNITUDE TO BE USED TO DEVELOP A RISK CALCULATOR FOR STARTING EARLIER CANCER SCREENING.

MALIGNANT BREAST TISSUE HAS UNIQUE L/W/P COMPOSITION FRACTIONS WHEN COMPARED TO NORMAL OR BENIGN BREAST TISSUE.

UNFORTUNATELY, THE CURRENT TISSUE BASED BIOMARKER APPROACH TO SELECTING PATIENTS FOR THESE TREATMENTS IS SUB- OPTIMAL DUE TO THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF THE INTERACTION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH THE TUMOR. GIVEN THE PROHIBITIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IO (>$200K/YEAR PER PATIENT), THERE IS A CRITICAL UNMET NEED FOR PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS TO IDENTIFY WHICH PATIENTS WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM IO. ADDITIONALLY, THE CURRENT CLINICAL STANDARD TO EVALUATING TUMOR RESPONSE (I.E. RECIST AND IRRC WHICH EVALUATE CHANGE IN TUMOR SIZE AND NODULE DISAPPEARANCE) IS SUB-OPTIMAL IN EVALUATING EARLY CLINICAL BENEFIT FROM IO DRUGS. THIS IS DUE AT LEAST IN PART TO THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS UNDERGOING IO PRESENT APPARENT DISEASE PROGRESSION (PSEUDO-PROGRESSION) ON POST-TREATMENT CT SCANS.

ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, EACH YEAR THERE ARE ~750,000 NEW HCC CASES RESULTING IN 700,000 DEATHS WORLDWIDE. WHILE HISTORICALLY SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY HAS BEEN THE CORNERSTONE TO CANCER TREATMENT, INABILITY TO ACHIEVE UNIFORM DRUG DELIVERY TO TUMORS, COLLATERAL TOXICITY TO THE NON-CANCEROUS LIVER AND SYSTEMIC SIDE-EFFECTS HAVE LIMITED PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL THERAPIES FOR LIVER CANCER. RECENTLY, NOVEL IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS (IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS (ICI), CAR-T CELLS, ONCOLYTIC VIRUS) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, BUT THERE ARE STILL LIMITATIONS TO THEIR USE DUE TO SYSTEMIC SIDE EFFECTS AND DIFFICULTY TO DELIVER TO SOLID TUMORS. ALTHOUGH TRANSCATHETER ARTERIAL CHEMOEMBOLIZATION (TACE), A PROCEDURE PERFORMED USING AN X-RAY GUIDED CATHETER TO DELIVER CHEMOTHERAPY COUPLED TO EMBOLIZATION BEADS INTO THE BLOOD VESSELS THAT PERFUSE THE LIVER TUMOR HAS SHOWN SUCCESS IN LIVER CANCER MANAGEMENT, THE EMBOLIZATION EFFICIENCY IS RELATIVELY LOW AS THE BEADS CANNOT BE READILY DELIVERED INTO DOWNSTREAM MICROVASCULATURE TO ACHIEVE UNIFORM ISCHEMIA AND CHEMOTHERAPY DELIVERY.

APPROVED CLINICAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDE CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT FOR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) AND MAGNETIC FLUID HYPERTHERMIA (MFH) FOR CANCER TREATMENT. MIONPS ARE T2 NEGATIVE CONTRAST AGENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN CLINICALLY AVAILABLE FOR MRI SINCE THE LATE 1980S WHERE VERY LOW TISSUE CONCENTRATIONS (<100 G FE/G TISSUE) ARE NEEDED FOR IMAGING. MFH IS A POWERFUL NANOTECHNOLOGY-BASED TREATMENT THAT ENHANCES RADIATION THERAPY (RT). IT COMPRISES LOCAL HEATING OF TISSUE BY ACTIVATING MIONPS WITH AN EXTERNAL ALTERNATING MAGNETIC FIELD (AMF), ENABLING TREATMENT ANYWHERE IN THE BODY. HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS DEMONSTRATED BENEFITS OF MFH FOR PROSTATE CANCER; AND, OVERALL SURVIVAL BENEFITS WITH RT IN RECURRENT GLIOBLASTOMA (GBM) RESULTED IN EUROPEAN APPROVAL IN 2010. HOWEVER, CURRENT MFH EFFECTIVENESS IS LIMITED BY THE INABILITY TO VISUALIZE MIONP DISTRIBUTION DURING MFH, RESULTING IN POOR AMF CONTROL OF MIONP HEATING, REDUCED THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY, AND UNWANTED OFF-TARGET TOXICITY. AN INTEGRATED MIONP IMAGING-MFH TECHNOLOGY THAT PROVIDES SPATIAL CONTROL OF THE MFH TREATMENT VOLUME WILL SUBSTANTIALLY ADVANCE THE CLINICAL USE OF THERANOSTIC MIONPS. MAGNETIC PARTICLE IMAGING (MPI) IS AN EMERGING IMAGING TECHNOLOGY THAT DIRECTLY QUANTITATES MIONP CONCENTRATION IN TISSUE WITH SIMILAR OR GREATER SENSITIVITY AS MRI. THE MAIN MAGNET IN AN MPI SCANNER PRODUCES A STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD GRADIENT CONTAINING A REGION WHERE THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS APPROXIMATELY ZERO, I.E. THE FIELD FREE REGION (FFR). MIONPS IN THE FFR ARE MAGNETICALLY UNSATURATED AND CAN PRODUCE A SIGNAL IN A RECEIVER COIL, WHILE MIONPS ELSEWHERE ARE MAGNETICALLY SATURATED AND PRODUCE NO SIGNAL. IMAGES ARE PRODUCED BY RASTERING THE FFR ACROSS THE SAMPLE. THE FFR USED FOR IMAGING CAN BE USED TO LOCALIZE MFH. BY APPLYING A MAGNETIC FIELD GRADIENT AND AMF, ONLY MIONPS INSIDE THE FFR WILL HEAT WHILE MIONPS OUTSIDE THE FFR ARE SATURATED AND DO NOT HEAT. MPI AND MFH ARE COMPATIBLE ENABLING MM-PRECISION SPATIAL CONTROL OF MFH.

GERMLINE ALTERATIONS IN ONE OF FOUR DNA MISMATCH REPAIR (MMR) GENES CAUSES LS, AN AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT CONDITION ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE MALIGNANCIES AND THE MOST COMMON INHERITED CRC SYNDROME. LS AFFECTS NEARLY 1/300 INDIVIDUALS AND ~1 MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN THE US, SIMILAR TO BRCA-RELATED HEREDITARY BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER SYNDROME.

TUMOR INVASION MAKE COMPLETE SURGICAL RESECTION DIFFICULT LEADING TO LOCAL RECURRENCE WITHIN 2 CENTIMETERS OF THE ORIGINAL TUMOR IN 90-95% OF PATIENTS. MOST SYSTEMICALLY DELIVERED CHEMOTHERAPY AGENTS ARE INEFFECTIVE AGAINST GBM BECAUSE THEY CANNOT REACH THE BRAIN AT THERAPEUTIC CONCENTRATIONS DUE TO THE BLOOD- BRAIN BARRIER. THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER IS A HIGHLY SELECTIVE AND SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE THAT SEPARATES THE CIRCULATING BLOOD FROM THE BRAIN TISSUES AS A PROTECTIVE MECHANISM. THE CAPILLARIES THAT LINE THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER HAVE ESPECIALLY RESTRICTIVE TIGHT-JUNCTIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PERMEATION OF SYSTEMICALLY ADMINISTERED CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS TO BRAIN TISSUES. A PROMISING STRATEGY TO AVOID THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER AND REDUCE DOSE- LIMITING TOXICITIES OBSERVED WITH SYSTEMIC DELIVERY IS TO ADMINISTER DRUGS DIRECTLY TO THE BRAIN BY IMPLANTING THEM WITHIN THE CAVITY LEFT AFTER GBM RESECTION.

MULTIPLE STUDIES FROM OUR LABORATORY AND OTHERS HAVE ESTABLISHED THE DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF MUC4 IN PANCREATIC PATHOLOGIES. WHILE IT IS UNDETECTABLE IN THE NORMAL PANCREAS, DE NOVO OVEREXPRESSION OF MUC4 IS RESTRICTED TO HIGH-RISK-PRECURSOR LESIONS AND INVASIVE PC AND ITS EXPRESSION INCREASES PROGRESSIVELY DISEASE ADVANCEMENT. AN IN-HOUSE GENERATED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY (MAB) AGAINST MUC4, 8G7, WHICH RECOGNIZES REPETITIVE EPITOPES IN THE TANDEM REPEAT DOMAIN, HAS EMERGED AS A USEFUL TOOL FOR ULTRASENSITIVE DETECTION AND DEFINING THE ROLE OF MUC4 IN TUMOR PROGRESSION AND METASTASIS. HIGH MUC4 EXPRESSION IN PC IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR SURVIVAL, WHILE IN PRECURSOR LESIONS, MUC4 EXPRESSION IS A PREDICTOR OF MALIGNANT RISK.

THEREFORE, NEOADJUVANT THERAPY (NAT) IS AN EMERGING STANDARD APPROACH, BUT IS ONLY BENEFICIAL IF THE SELECTED SYSTEMIC THERAPY IS EFFECTIVE. INDEED, FOR ALL PATIENTS WITH PDA, METASTATIC OR OTHERWISE, THE DURATION OF EFFECTIVE SYSTEMIC THERAPY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THEIR SURVIVAL. THERE IS A CRITICAL UNMET NEED FOR ACCURATE AND TIMELY ASSESSMENT OF TREATMENT RESPONSE IN ORDER TO 1) GET PATIENTS ON EFFECTIVE SYSTEMIC THERAPY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND KEEP THEM ON IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, 2) EXPEDITIOUSLY DISCONTINUE TOXIC, COSTLY AND INEFFECTIVE THERAPIES, AND 3) FACILITATE EVIDENCE-BASED PERSONALIZED CLINICAL DECISIONS REGARDING CURATIVE- INTENT SURGERY.

THE POOR RESPONSE RATES RESULT IN PART FROM RESISTANCE TO CHEMOTHERAPY, PARTICULARLY PLATINUM- AND TAXANE-BASED AGENTS. OVARIAN CANCER OFTEN METASTASIZES VIA TRANSCOELOMIC ROUTES ALONG CURRENTS OF ASCITIC FLUID IN THE PERITONEAL CAVITY. WE HAVE ENGINEERED A 3D ADHERENT PERFUSION MODEL TO MIMIC OVARIAN NODULES THAT STUD PERITONEAL SURFACES AND RECAPITULATE RESISTANT DISEASE, THEREBY PROVIDING A UNIQUE PLATFORM TO DEVELOP TARGETED THERAPIES. OUR STUDIES SHOWED THAT PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT FLUID SHEAR STRESS (FSS) INDUCES A PRO- METASTATIC PHENOTYPE AND CONFERS RESISTANCE TO PLATINUM AGENTS. PHOTOIMMUNOTHERAPY (PIT) HAS SHOWN PROMISE IN SELECTIVELY IMAGING AND TREATING DISSEMINATED TUMORS, AND IT CAN RESENSITIZE CHEMORESISTANT CANCER CELLS TO PLATINUM AGENTS. HOWEVER, THE HIGH THRESHOLDS OF INTRACELLULAR PHOTOIMMUNOCONJUGATE REQUIRED FOR CELL DEATH HAVE HINDERED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PIT IN PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT MODELS. THEREFORE, THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A MULTI-PURPOSE NANOPLATFORM THAT BREAKS THE SELECTIVITY-UPTAKE TRADE-OFF OF PHOTOIMMUNOCONJUGATES AND ENABLES MULTI-TIER CANCER TARGETING UNDER PERITONEAL FSS. WE HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN THAT SUCCESSFUL CONJUGATION OF PHOTOIMMUNOCONJUGATES ONTO NANOPARTICLES CAN EFFECTIVELY ENHANCE INTRATUMORAL PHOTOIMMUNOCONJUGATE DELIVERY AND IMPROVE PIT OUTCOMES IN MICE. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT NANOSCALE ENGINEERING ENABLES HIGH-PAYLOAD CO-DELIVERY OF PHOTOIMMUNOCONJUGATE AND CHEMOTHERAPY IN A MANNER THAT IS SAFE AND EFFICACIOUS IN OVERCOMING FSS-INDUCED CHEMORESISTANCE.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR MCRPC IS A SIGNIFICANT UNMET CLINICAL NEED. THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITIES IN TREATMENT RESPONSES OF MCRPC, NECESSITATING THE USE OF MORE PERSONALIZED STRATEGIES IN GUIDING TREATMENT BASED ON THE SPECIFIC GENOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE LIMITATIONS IN USING THE TRADITIONAL TISSUE- BASED GENOMIC PROFILING TO GUIDE MCRPC TREATMENT, PARTLY BECAUSE MCRPC IS A BONE-PREDOMINANT METASTATIC DISEASE, THUS TISSUE SAMPLES ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AND YIELDS ARE GENERALLY LOW. MOREOVER, DURING TREATMENTS, THE GENOMIC PROFILES OF TUMORS MAY CHANGE QUICKLY TO EVADE THERAPEUTIC OR IMMUNE ATTACKS, LEADING TO DRUG RESISTANCE. IN ORDER TO PROMPTLY AND ACCURATELY CAPTURE THESE CHANGES AND ADJUST TREATMENT PLANS, REPEATED TUMOR BIOPSIES WOULD BE NEEDED, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO PERFORM IN ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICES GIVEN THE INVASIVE AND BONE-PREDOMINANT NATURE OF MCRPC. THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MCRPC PROGNOSIS, IT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP NOVEL, NON-INVASIVE LIQUID BIOPSY APPROACHES TO REAL-TIME MONITOR TREATMENT RESPONSE AND GUIDE THE USE OF DIFFERENT TREATMENTS. CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS (CTCS) ARE SHED FROM TUMORS INTO BLOOD AND HAVE EXTREMELY HIGH MALIGNANT POTENTIAL, AND ARE ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT SUBSET OF TUMOR CELLS TO MONITOR AND TREAT. CTCS CAN BE NON-INVASIVELY AND REPEATEDLY ENUMERATED IN REAL-TIME, AND HAVE EXHIBITED PROMISING PROGNOSTIC POTENTIALS, AS EVIDENCED BY THE FDA-APPROVAL OF THE CELLSEARCH PLATFORM FOR CTC ENUMERATIONS AS AN INDEPENDENT PROGNOSTIC FACTOR OF SEVERAL METASTATIC CANCERS INCLUDING MCRPC.

IN COMPARISON, THE DEGREE OF CYTOREDUCTION AT SURGERY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR PROGNOSIS AND METHODS TO IMPROVE ITS EFFICACY ARE SORELY NEEDED. DETECTION PRE-SURGICALLY AND AT SURGERY ARE MAJOR CONSTRAINTS. PRESENTLY, PRE- SURGICAL IMAGING IS LIMITED IN DETECTING I.P. DISEASE, AND, SURGERY IS LIMITED BECAUSE IT RELIES ON THE NAKED EYE TO IDENTIFY NODULES FOR RESECTION. MOREOVER, SOME NODULES ARE IN ELOQUENT LOCATIONS THAT PRECLUDE SURGERY. A THERANOSTIC AGENT THAT UPON A SINGLE INJECTION ENABLES IN VIVO IMAGING OF I.P. DISEASE FOR PRE-SURGICAL PLANNING, NEAR-INFRARED (NIR) IMAGING TO VISUALIZE TUMORS AT SURGERY FOR RESECTION, AND PHOTODESTRUCTION OF TUMORS IN ELOQUENT LOCATIONS IS A KEY CLINICAL NEED IN OVARIAN CANCER. FOR MR IMAGING, WE CREATED DUAL-GD LIPOSOMAL NANOPARTICLES, WITH TWO GADOLINIUM (GD) PRESENTATIONS UPON THE LIPOSOME TO INCREASE RELAXIVITY, AND DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY HAVE ~10,000 TIMES GREATER RELAXIVITY/NANOPARTICLE THAN CURRENT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE MR CONTRAST AGENTS. DUAL-GD IS BASED ON FDA APPROVED BUILDING BLOCKS. FOR NIR IMAGING, WE INCORPORATED INDOCYANINE GREEN (ICG), THE ONLY FDA APPROVED NIR FLUOROPHORE.

HOWEVER, THE PROCESS OF LOCATING AND DELINEATING ANATOMIC ORGANS AND PATHOLOGIC REGIONS IN MEDICAL IMAGES, KNOWN AS IMAGE SEGMENTATION, AT A HIGH LEVEL OF AUTOMATION HAS REMAINED A MAJOR HURDLE TO THESE ADVANCES. MOST DEVELOPMENTS ON IMAGE SEGMENTATION HAVE FOCUSED ON A SPECIFIC ORGAN OR A SMALL GROUP OF OBJECTS IN A SPECIFIC BODY REGION. A NEW METHOD OR A MAJOR ADAPTATION OF AN EXISTING METHOD IS ENGINEERED WHEN ANY OF THESE PARAMETERS CHANGED. SUCH AN APPROACH IS NOT SUSTAINABLE AND BECOMES A STUMBLING BLOCK WHEN DEALING WITH WHOLE-BODY SYSTEMIC DISEASES WHERE BODY-WIDE IMAGE ANALYTICS IS REQUIRED. A CRITICAL ADVANCE IS NEEDED IN THIS FIELD TO OVERCOME TWO MAIN CHALLENGES: (1) ALTHOUGH PRIOR INFORMATION ABOUT NORMAL ANATOMY IS DEEMED VITAL FOR IMAGE SEGMENTATION AND ANALYSIS, ITS CREATION AND UTILIZATION BODY-WIDE ON A MASSIVE SCALE HAVE NOT BEEN ATTEMPTED AND ARE SORELY LACKING. (2) TECHNIQUES TO EMPLOY SUCH INFORMATION AND METHODS FOR BODY-WIDE DISEASE QUANTIFICATION AT HIGH LEVELS OF AUTOMATION DO NOT EXIST.

HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC), THE FOURTH MOST COMMON CAUSE OF CANCER-RELATED DEATHS WORLDWIDE, MOST OFTEN DEVELOPS IN PATIENTS WITH UNDERLYING LIVER CIRRHOSIS SECONDARY TO ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE (ALD), NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD), OR HEPATITIS B/C INFECTIONS. CIRRHOSIS FROM ANY CAUSE IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED RISK FACTOR FOR HCC; HOWEVER, CURRENT SURVEILLANCE REGIMENS WITH ABDOMINAL IMAGING AND SERUM BIOMARKERS (E.G., AFP) HAVE POOR SENSITIVITY FOR DIAGNOSING HCC AT AN EARLY STAGE, WHEN IT IS POTENTIALLY CURABLE. THEREFORE, BIOMARKERS THAT SENSITIVELY DISTINGUISH EARLY-STAGE HCC FROM AT-RISK LIVER CIRRHOSIS ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED. EXPLORING THE DIAGNOSTIC POTENTIAL OF HCC EVS AND EV CARGO PROFILING FOR DETECTING EARLY-STAGE HCC HOLDS GREAT PROMISE TO SIGNIFICANTLY AUGMENT THE ABILITY OF CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC MODALITIES.

CONVENTIONAL METHODS FOR ISOLATING EVS, SUCH AS ULTRACENTRIFUGATION, FILTRATION, AND PRECIPITATION, ARE INCAPABLE OF DISCRIMINATING TUMOR-DERIVED EVS FROM NON-TUMOR-DERIVED EVS.

THE DELIVERABLES OF THIS PROPOSED STUDY INCLUDE: (1) SERIAL CTDNA PROFILES IN A LARGE COHORT OF EARLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS; (2) A PREDICTION TOOL THAT WILL CALCULATE THE PROBABILITY OF PCR (OR RESIDUAL CANCER BURDEN, RCB 0) AT AN EARLY TIME POINT DURING TREATMENT, AND (3) A PROGNOSTIC TOOL THAT WILL PROVIDE ACCURATE RISK ASSESSMENT FOR EARLY METASTATIC RECURRENCE IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RESIDUAL DISEASE AFTER NAC (NON-PCR OR RCB 1/2/3).  OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO USE THE PCR PREDICTION TOOL IN THE CLINICAL TRIAL SETTING TO IDENTIFY GOOD RESPONDERS WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY SURGICAL TREATMENT TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO TOXICITIES FROM UNNECESSARY ADDITIONAL THERAPIES; AND POOR RESPONDERS WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM A SWITCH IN THERAPY TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVING A PCR.

ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS (AYAS) WHO UNDERGO HCT ARE AT AN ESPECIALLY HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING SARCOPENIA (LOSS OF SKELETAL MUSCLE MASS) DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HCT-RELATED EXPOSURES ON THE IMMATURE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT SARCOPENIA OCCURS EARLIER IN HCT SURVIVORS THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM ADVANCING AGE ALONE. HCT SURVIVORS WHO ARE SARCOPENIC HAVE A TWO-FOLD RISK OF NON-RELAPSE MORTALITY EXCESS RATES OF PREMATURE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THEREFORE, TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF AYA HCT SURVIVORS, IT IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO DEVELOP INTERVENTIONS TO INCREASE SKELETAL MUSCLE MASS, METABOLISM, STRENGTH, AND FUNCTION. SKELETAL MUSCLE IS HIGHLY RELIANT ON MITOCHONDRIAL ENERGY PRODUCTION, AS MEASURED BY OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION (OXPHOS) CAPACITY. THUS, ONE STRATEGY TO IMPROVE SKELETAL MUSCLE FUNCTION IS TO INCREASE MUSCLE OXPHOS IN THESE SURVIVORS. HOME-BASED EXERCISE (AEROBIC AND RESISTANCE) TRAINING IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED INTERVENTION TO INCREASE SKELETAL MUSCLE MITOCHONDRIAL OXPHOS, AS WELL AS MASS, STRENGTH, AND FUNCTION. ANOTHER APPROACH IS TO USE AN \u201cEXERCISE MIMETIC\u201d, AN INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO RECAPITULATE THE PHYSIOLOGIC BENEFITS OF EXERCISE. PRECURSORS OF NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (NAD+), A COFACTOR REQUIRED FOR ATP PRODUCTION, ARE EXERCISE MIMETICS.

WHILE 5-YEAR SURVIVAL OF METASTATIC PDAC IS <5%, OUTCOMES DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE FOR LOCALIZED PDAC. POOR PROGNOSIS IS DUE TO A LACK OF BIOMARKERS FOR DIAGNOSING PDAC AT AN EARLY, ASYMPTOMATIC STAGE WHEN CURE IS POSSIBLE.

CEST HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED FEASIBILITY IN NEUROONCOLOGY APPLICATIONS. THE MANAGEMENT OF SRMS IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THEM ARE BENIGN OR INDOLENT MALIGNANT TUMORS, LEADING TO PATIENT EXPOSURE TO UNNECESSARY MORBIDITY FROM BIOPSIES AND SURGERY.

CONSEQUENTLY, PERSONS WITH EARLY-ONSET (<50 YEARS) CRC (EOCRC) MORE FREQUENTLY PRESENT WITH SYMPTOMATIC DISEASE AT ADVANCED STAGES (III/IV) RESULTING IN GREATER LOSS OF LIFE IN YOUNG CASES. IN 2020, THE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE RECOMMENDED THE AGE FOR CRC SCREENING BY COLONOSCOPY OR FECAL TESTS BE REDUCED TO 45 YEARS. HOWEVER, THE UPTAKE OF SCREENING BY THESE METHODS IN ALL SCREEN-ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS IS LOW, INCLUDING IN THOSE <50 YEARS WHO ARE GENETICALLY AT HIGH RISK, SO ADHERENCE IN THE ASYMPTOMATIC POPULATION <50 YEARS IS ALSO LIKELY TO BE LOW.

HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY 90% OF PATIENTS AFTER SUBOPTIMAL RESECTION AND 70% OF PATIENTS AFTER OPTIMAL CYTOREDUCTION WILL EXPERIENCE RELAPSE WITHIN 18-24 MONTHS. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE STANDARD-OF-CARE FOR RECURRENT PATIENTS WHO RETURN TO THE CLINIC WITH DRUG-RESISTANT METASTATIC DISEASE. AS A RESULT, THEIR SURVIVAL RATE IS VERY LOW. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS \u201cTO DEVELOP A NON-SURGICAL, TARGETED, AND CLINICALLY TRANSLATABLE STEM CELL-BASED PLATFORM THAT CAN OVERCOME DRUG RESISTANCE IN RECURRENT AND METASTATIC OVARIAN CANCER\u201d. THE SUCCESS OF THE DEVELOPED STEM CELL-BASED PLATFORM WILL BE MEASURED BY NOT ONLY DEMONSTRATING THE ERADICATION OF METASTASIS AND INHIBITION OF RELAPSE, BUT ALSO PROVIDING LONG-TERM SURVIVAL BENEFITS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED AND ISOLATED A UNIQUE ADIPOSE-DERIVED STEM CELL (ASC) CLONE THAT OVEREXPRESSES SECRETORY HUMAN CARBOXYLESTERASE 2 FOR TARGETED ENZYME/PRODRUG THERAPY OF CANCER, AND NANOLUCIFERASE FOR QUANTIFICATION OF RESPONSE TO THERAPY AND EVALUATION OF CANCER RELAPSE. USING BIOLUMINESCENT IMAGING (BLI) COMPLEMENTED WITH MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ENGINEERED ASCS MIGRATE AND LOCALIZE AT BOTH OVARIAN TUMOR STROMA AND NECROTIC REGIONS. OUR PUBLISHED DATA ALSO SHOW THAT THE ENGINEERED ASCS ARE ABLE TO TARGET AND KILL THE DRUG-RESISTANT OC CELLS THAT ARE RICH IN CANCER STEM-LIKE CELLS (CSCS), OVEREXPRESS MDR-1/ABCG2 DRUG EFFLUX PUMPS, AND HAVE HIGH ALDH ENZYME ACTIVITY. STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF TUMOR BURDEN AND SURVIVAL RATES SHOWED THAT ADMINISTRATION OF THE ENGINEERED ASCS IN COMBINATION WITH THE PRODRUG IRINOTECAN PROVIDED COMPLETE TUMOR RESPONSE AND SURVIVAL BENEFITS IN 80% OF TREATED MICE. TO TRANSFORM THIS ASC-BASED TECHNOLOGY INTO A PLATFORM WITH A BROAD APPLICATION IN TARGETED THERAPY OF RECURRENT OC, WE WILL USE EPITHELIAL OC CELLS THAT ARE OBTAINED FROM PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED VARIOUS TREATMENT MODALITIES BUT HAVE RETURNED TO THE CLINIC WITH DRUG-RESISTANT DISEASE. THE BIODISTRIBUTION AND TUMOR TROPISM OF THE ENGINEERED ASCS WILL BE DETERMINED BY BLI, MRI, AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY. THE TUMOR RESPONSE TO THERAPY, INHIBITION OF CANCER RELAPSE, AND LONG-TERM SURVIVAL BENEFITS WILL BE DETERMINED IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED MICE.

IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN INTENSE SCRUTINY OF THE MUTATIONAL LANDSCAPE, USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASES SUCH AS THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS AND OTHER IMPORTANT SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON SOMATIC MUTATIONS.

THESE INCLUDE BOTH BENIGN RENAL TUMORS AND MALIGNANT RENAL CELL CARCINOMAS (RCCS). CURRENT IMAGING OR BIOPSIES CANNOT RELIABLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN BENIGN TUMORS, LOW GRADE RCCS, AND HIGH GRADE RCCS.

WE HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF ACQUIRING DYNAMIC HP 13C PYRUVATE MRI OF RENAL TUMORS IN PATIENTS, WITH EXCELLENT METABOLIC CONTRAST BETWEEN TUMOR AND NORMAL KIDNEY. BUILDING UPON THESE PROMISING PRELIMINARY DATA, WE NOW PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE VALUE OF HP 13C PYRUVATE MRI FOR RISK STRATIFYING LOCALIZED RENAL TUMORS. AIM 1- WE WILL OPTIMIZE THE MRI ACQUISITION STRATEGIES FOR RENAL TUMOR METABOLIC EVALUATION. AIM 2- WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE VALUE OF HP 13C PYRUVATE MRI FOR DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN BENIGN TUMORS, LOW GRADE RCCS, AND HIGH GRADE RCCS. WE WILL ALSO COMPARE HP 13C DATA TO ADVANCED 1H MRI AND RADIOMICS ANALYSES, AND DEVELOP MULTI-PARAMETRIC MODEL TO ASSESS WHETHER IT CAN IMPROVE THE PREDICTION. AIM 3- WE WILL DETERMINE THE REPEATABILITY OF HP 13C PYRUVATE MRI OF RENAL TUMORS, AND EVALUATE NEW ANALYSIS METHODS TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE ROBUSTNESS OF METABOLISM QUANTIFICATION. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST DATA ON THE VALUE OF HP 13C PYRUVATE MRI IN PREDICTING RENAL TUMOR AGGRESSIVENESS, AND WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR FUTURE LARGER CLINICAL STUDIES.

THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE FAST, ACCURATE, ACCESSIBLE NON-CONTRAST-ENHANCED MRI SCREENING METHODS TO SAFELY DETECT BREAST CANCER IN THE HIGH-RISK POPULATION. RELEVANCE: SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY IS SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING BREAST CANCER MORTALITY, BUT MISSES MANY IMPORTANT CANCERS, ESPECIALLY IN WOMEN WITH A HIGH RISK OF BREAST CANCER, AND IN THE 27 MILLION WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS WHO UNDERGO SCREENING. MRI HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE MORE THAN TWICE AS SENSITIVE FOR SCREENING IN MANY SCENARIOS, BUT HIGH COST, DISCOMFORT, AND POOR COMPLIANCE DUE TO THE NEED FOR IV GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST AGENTS WITH SIDE EFFECTS LIMIT ITS IMPACT FOR SCREENING. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CHANGE THIS PARADIGM BY DEVELOPING A RAPID, INEXPENSIVE, COMFORTABLE, NON-CONTRAST-ENHANCED BREAST MRI SCREENING EXAM. APPROACH: BASED ON SUBSTANTIAL PRIOR WORK, OUR GROUP WILL DEVELOP HIGH-RESOLUTION 3D AND 2D DIFFUSION MRI METHODS THAT CAN DEPICT IMPORTANT MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES AND QUANTIFY DIFFUSION HETEROGENEITY IN BREAST LESIONS. TO SUPPORT THESE METHODS, WE WILL RST IMPLEMENT EXIBLE, CLOSELY-TTING SOFT BREAST COIL ARRAYS THAT MAXIMIZE SNR AND PARALLEL IMAGING CAPABILITIES WHILE REDUCING POSITIONING TIME AND INCREASING COMFORT. WE WILL COMBINE THE EFCIENCY AND MOTION-INSENSITIVITY OF NON-CARTESIAN 3D CONES IMAGING WITH THE DOUBLE-ECHO STEADY-STATE DIF- FUSION APPROACH TO OFFER EFCIENT 3D DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED IMAGING (DWI). ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL REDESIGN ECHO-PLANAR IMAGING (EPI) DWI INCLUDING ASYMMETRIC ENCODING WITH BULK MOTION INSENSITIVITY, FULL K-SPACE READOUTS, AND NOVEL LOCALLY LOW-RANK RECONSTRUCTION TO PROVIDE HIGH-RESOLUTION QUANTITATIVE DWI THAT IS ROBUST TO SMALL PATIENT MOTION.

DEVELOPMENT OF A BIOMARKER TO IDENTIFY THE PRESENCE OF THE ACTIVE CDK4 TARGET, AND THEREFORE CDK4I SENSITIVE PATIENTS, WOULD ENABLE RESPONSIVE METASTATIC BREAST CANCER PATIENTS TO BE PINPOINTED AT THE ONSET OF THERAPY. AS CDK4/6 IS DOWNSTREAM OF ALL ONCOGENIC SIGNALING PATHWAYS, IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT THIS CLASS OF DRUGS WILL HAVE EFFICACY IN AT LEAST A SUBSET OF ADDITIONAL TUMOR TYPES, AND A BIOMARKER FOR CDK4I RESPONSIVENESS WOULD ACCELERATE THE EXPANSION OF THIS CLASS OF THERAPY INTO TUMOR TYPES, SUCH AS METASTATIC HER2+, TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST OR OVARIAN CANCER, WHICH HAVE FEW THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS.

CANCERS ACTIVATE STRESS SIGNALS IN THE FORM OF BH3-DOMAIN PROTEINS LIKE BIM AS THEY ESCAPE CELLULAR GROWTH CONSTRAINTS AND INVADE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS. TO REMAIN VIABLE, TUMORS USE SURVIVAL PROTEINS LIKE BCL2, BCLX, BCLW AND MCL1 TO SEQUESTER THESE BH3 PROTEINS THROUGH SPECIFIC PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS (PPIS). THIS BLOCKS THEIR APOPTOTIC SIGNAL BUT ALSO RENDERS SUCH TUMORS CONTINUALLY DEPENDENT ON THIS FUNCTION. DRUGS THAT COMPETITIVELY DISPLACE BH3 PROTEINS FROM THE SURVIVAL PROTEIN SEQUESTERING THEM UNLEASH A POTENT APOPTOTIC SIGNAL. INDEED, VENETOCLAX IS A BCL2 INHIBITOR THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED STRIKING CLINICAL EFFICACY, GARNERING FDA-APPROVAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC AND ADULT MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIAS.THESE TUMOR TYPES DO NOT HAVE BCL2-ACTIVATINGMUTATIONS BUT ARE EMPIRICALLY DEFINED TO BE DEPENDENT ON BCL2 FOR THEIR SURVIVAL.

THIS SEQUESTERS BIM'S APOPTOTIC ACTIVITY, BUT ALSO ENCODES A CONTINUAL DEPENDENCY, AND DEFINES A MECHANISTIC BIOMARKER DEFINING THE SURVIVAL PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR VIABILITY. AN UNANTICIPATED FINDING IS THAT THIS SURVIVAL DEPENDENCY IS HIGHLY CANCER CELL INTRINSIC AND STABLE: CONSISTENT IN PATIENT-MATCHED TUMORS FROM PRIMARY AND METASTATIC SITES, AND AT DIAGNOSIS AND RELAPSE. IN TUMORS WITH BIM BOUND BY BCL2 (BIM:BCL2 PPI), BCL2 INHIBITORS LIKE VENETOCLAX ARE HIGHLY ACTIVE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO. IN TUMORS WITH BIM BOUND BY MCL1 (BIM:MCL1 PPI), BCL2 INHIBITORS HAVE NO ACTIVITY. FURTHER, WE FIND THAT ALL NEUROBLASTOMAS WITH MAPK PATHWAY MUTATIONS ARE IN THE BIM:MCL1 CLASS. SURPRISINGLY, MCL1 INHIBITORS ALSO HAVE NO ACTIVITY FOR THIS SUBSET, DESPITE DISPLACING BIM FROM MCL1. IN THESE TUMORS, BIM IS RE-SEQUESTERED BY BCLX, AND ALL ARE EXQUISITELY SENSITIVE TO COMBINED MCL1/BCLX INHIBITION.

NO SIMILAR DEVICES CURRENTLY EXIST. THIS TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS OF A ROBOTIC ULTRASOUND PROBE MANIPULATOR AND SOFTWARE FOR ULTRASOUND PROCESSING, ROBOT CONTROL, FUSION TB, AND OPTIMIZED SB PLANNING. OUR NOVEL SB PLANNING SOFTWARE OPTIMIZES THE BIOPSY CORE LOCATIONS FOR EACH PATIENT TO MAXIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DETECTING CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PCA AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT MPMRI VISIBLE LESIONS, IF AVAILABLE. THE ROBOTIC DEVICE WAS CLEARED FOR CLINICAL TRIALS BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND OUR INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD APPROVED THE STUDY. A PHASE 0, SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY CLINICAL TRIAL WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. WE PROPOSE A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL TO GAIN EARLY EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PERSONALIZED BIOPSY PLANNING AND PRECISION BIOPSY TO IMPROVE THE DETECTION RATE OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PCA IN A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL VERSUS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FUSION BIOPSY DEVICES ON THE MARKET. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE 5-YEAR PROJECT ARE: A1) PERFORM RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF ROBOT VS. THE FUSION DEVICE. INCLUDE PATIENTS WITH MPMRI EXAMS. ON EACH ARM, PERFORM SB ON PI-RADS=2 AND TB+SB ON PI-RADS=3 PATIENTS; A2) RECORD PATHOLOGY FROM SUBSET OF PATIENTS OF A1 WHO PROCEED TO RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY, AND COMPARE BIOPSY TO PROSTATECTOMY RESULTS ON BOTH ARMS; A3) OFFLINE, SIMULATE SB ALONE PLANS FOR PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO SB+TB AND DETERMINE IF SB CORES COULD OVERLAP TB LOCATIONS;", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01CA247959_7529"}, {"internal_id": 116434732, "Award ID": "R01CA247910", "Award Amount": 1979049.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-09", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "MACHINE LEARNING FOR RISK-ADJUSTED BREAST MRI SCREENING - SUMMARY MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) IS THE MOST SENSITIVE IMAGING MODALITY FOR BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS TO DATE. WOMEN WITH A STRONG FAMILY HISTORY OR RELATED GENETIC MUTATIONS HAVE AN ELEVATED RISK OF BREAST CANCER AND ARE RECOMMENDED TO PARTICIPATE IN YEARLY MRI SCREENINGS. HOWEVER, THE RATE OF DETECTION IN THIS HIGH-RISK COHORT IS SMALL, PROMPTING A DESIRE TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY MRI EXAMS. THE BASIC HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROJECT IS THAT WITHIN THE SCREENING COHORT THE INDIVIDUAL RISK OF A FUTURE CANCER CAN BE ESTIMATED BASED ON THE APPEARANCE OF BREAST MRI AND MAMMOGRAMS TODAY. IN PRELIMINARY WORK WE HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED LOW-RISK WOMEN THAT COULD HAVE OMITTED A SCREENING SESSION WITHOUT MISSING A NEW CANCER. THE DISCOVERY OF THIS LOWER-RISK SUBGROUP WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY MODERN DEEP-LEARNING TOOLS DEVELOPED IN PRELIMINARY WORK. MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING CANCER CENTER (MSK) HAS ACCRUED A DATABASE OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000 BREAST MRI EXAMS OVER 18 YEARS ALONG WITH THE PATIENTS\u2019 CLINICAL OUTCOMES. THIS UNPRECEDENTED RESOURCE ENABLES THE TRAINING OF MODERN MACHINE LEARNING \u201cFROM THE GROUND-UP\u201d TO EXTRACT AND CLASSIFY VOLUMETRIC MRI FEATURES. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE AS FOLLOWS. AIM 1 (DATA CURATION): SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE LARGE DATASET ACCRUED AT MSK REQUIRES CAREFUL CURATION INCLUDING IMAGE CONTENT, IMAGE QUALITY, PATHOLOGY RESULTS, CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP, AS WELL AS DEMOGRAPHIC AND GENOMIC INFORMATION. THE OUTCOME OF THIS AIM IS A CURATED DATASET THAT CAN BROADLY BENEFIT FUTURE TECHNICAL EFFORTS IN BREAST DIAGNOSIS. AIM 2 (DEEP LEARNING): TO MAKE RISK STRATIFICATION QUANTITATIVE WE PROPOSE TO ANALYZE THE MRI SCANS USING MODERN DEEP NETWORKS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO IDENTIFY THE LOCATION AND EXTENT OF A CANCER. WE WILL THEN TRANSFER THE MRI FEATURES OF THESE TRAINED NETWORKS AS WELL AS NETWORKS TRAINED ON MAMMOGRAMS TO THE TASK OF DIAGNOSIS AND RISK ASSESSMENT. THE INTENDED OUTCOME OF THIS AIM ARE PREDICTIVE MODELS WITH HUMAN-LEVEL PERFORMANCE AT DIAGNOSIS AND SEGMENTATION. AIM 3 (RISK ADJUSTED SCREENING): TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF SCREENING WHILE MAINTAINING SENSITIVITY WE WILL ESTIMATE THE RISK OF FINDING A MALIGNANT TUMOR IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON THE PRESENT MRI EXAM AND MOST RECENT MAMMOGRAM AS WELL AS PATIENT INFORMATION. THE MACHINE-ESTIMATED RISK WILL BE USED IN A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY OUTCOME, NAMELY, THE NUMBER OF EXAMS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN OMITTED BY SCHEDULING A LONGER SCREENING INTERVAL WITHOUT COMPROMISING SENSITIVITY. THIS WILL BE REPEATED ON NEWLY ACCRUED DATA AT MSK, DUKE AND JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY (JHU) AS SECONDARY SITES. ONCE VALIDATED, THE RISK-PREDICTION MODEL WILL BE PUBLICLY RELEASED TO ENCOURAGE DATA SHARING AND CLINICAL ADOPTION. THE PRELIMINARY WORK PERFORMED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER A UNIQUE INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM INCLUDING CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS ON BREAST MRI AT MSK, AND MACHINE-LEARNING AND MEDICAL IMAGING EXPERTS AT CCNY, DUKE AND JHU. THE PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED HERE IS APPLICABLE BEYOND BREAST CANCER, AND THE TRANSFER LEARNING APPROACH APPLICABLE IN PARTICULAR TO CANCERS WITH MORE LIMITED DATASETS.", "Place of

WITH PROSTATE CANCER WILL NOT DIE OF THE DISEASE, PROSTATE CANCER IS STILL THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATH AMONG MEN IN THE UNITED STATES. WHILE SCREENING FOR PROSTATE CANCER REDUCES DEATH FROM DISEASE, THIS COMES AT THE PRICE OF BOTH UNNECESSARY BIOPSIES THAT REVEAL NO EVIDENCE OF CANCER AND TREATMENT OF OTHERWISE INDOLENT CANCER RESULTING IN UNNECESSARY ADVERSE EVENTS. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN UNMET NEED FOR IMPROVED SCREENING TOOLS FOR PROSTATE CANCER. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED A FOUR-KALLIKREIN BIOMARKER PANEL THAT IS NOW COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AS A REFLEX TEST FOR USE AFTER AN INITIAL PSA SCREENING; FOUND THAT THE FOUR KALLIKREIN MODEL IMPROVES THE PREDICTION, PRIOR TO ANY DIAGNOSIS OF PROSTATE CANCER, OF WHICH MEN MAY DIE OF PROSTATE CANCER; AND IDENTIFIED SNPS ASSOCIATED WITH SURVIVAL TIME AFTER DIAGNOSIS, INDEPENDENT OF KNOWN PROGNOSTIC FACTORS. COMBINING THESE SNPS AND THE FOUR KALLIKREIN PANEL IMPROVES OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY MEN AT RISK OF DYING FROM PROSTATE CANCER EVEN FURTHER. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE PROPOSE HERE A GERMLINE GENOMIC APPROACH TO IDENTIFY MEN AT RISK OF DYING FROM PROSTATE CANCER. BY LEVERAGING RECENT COMPUTATIONAL ADVANCES IN GENOMIC ANALYSIS, WE WILL TAKE A GENE-CENTERED APPROACH TO IDENTIFY GENES FOR WHICH GENETICALLY CONTROLLED TRANSCRIPTIONAL ALTERATIONS AND/OR FUNCTIONAL CODING MUTATIONS INFLUENCE SURVIVAL TIME IN PROSTATE CANCER. USING THESE GENES, ALONG WITH KNOWN GENETIC RISK FACTORS FOR PROSTATE CANCER AND THE FOUR KALLIKREIN PANEL, WE WILL BUILD AND TEST MODELS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY MEN AT RISK FOR CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PROSTATE CANCER IN ORDER TO BETTER STRATIFY MEN IN THE SCREENING CONTEXT PRIOR TO BIOPSY. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL: 1) IDENTIFY GENES FOR WHICH GENETICALLY CONTROLLED EXPRESSION LEVEL CHANGES AND/OR RARE CODING VARIANTS ALTER THE RISK OF DYING FROM PROSTATE CANCER; 2) DETERMINE AT WHAT STAGE(S) OF DISEASE PROGRESSION THESE GENETIC CHANGES OPERATE; AND 3) IMPROVE OUR 4-KALLIKREIN BIOMARKER PREDICTOR OF LETHAL PROSTATE CANCER THROUGH INCORPORATION OF GENETIC DATA. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY CONDUCTING BOTH A TRANSCRIPTOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDY (TWAS) WITH PROSTATE SPECIFIC MODELS AND A WHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING STUDY IN A SET OF WELL-ANNOTATED COHORTS WITH LONG FOLLOW-UP TIME AFTER PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL ENABLE BETTER RISK STRATIFICATION OF MEN PRIOR TO PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS. WE ENVISION THESE FINDINGS BEING USEFUL IN THE SCREENING CONTEXT, ENABLING MORE PRECISE IDENTIFICATION OF MEN AT HIGH RISK OF DYING FROM PROSTATE CANCER IN THE NEXT TWO DECADES, THEREBY REDUCING DEATH FROM PROSTATE CANCER DUE TO THE BENEFITS OF EARLY DETECTION WHILE AVOIDING UNNECESSARY BIOPSIES AND UNNEEDED TREATMENT OF OTHERWISE INDOLENT CANCERS. FURTHERMORE, THESE FINDINGS WILL BE USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY OF LETHAL PROSTATE CANCER AS WE ANTICIPATE THESE FINDINGS WILL PINPOINT NEW GENES AND PATHWAYS THAT PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN

AND TARGETING OF HER2 POSITIVE EG CANCERS USING LOVASTATIN - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THE INCIDENCE OF ESOPHAGOGASTRIC (EG) CANCER IS INCREASING RAPIDLY, NOTABLY AMONG YOUNG MEN. IN PATIENTS CLINICALLY CLASSIFIED AS HER2-POSITIVE (ERBB2 AMPLIFICATION AND/OR 2+/3+ PROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION), THE COMBINATION OF THE THERAPEUTIC ANTI-HER2 ANTIBODY TRASTUZUMAB AND STANDARD CYTOTOXIC THERAPY PROLONGS PROGRESSION-FREE AND OVERALL SURVIVAL. HOWEVER, INTRINSIC TUMOR RESISTANCE OR MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE DEVELOPED DURING TREATMENT LIMIT THE CLINICAL BENEFIT IN 32% OF PATIENTS, AND OTHER ANTI-HER2 THERAPEUTIC ANTIBODIES FAILED IN CLINICAL TRIALS TO TREAT EG CANCER. COMPLEMENTARY BIOMARKERS AND METHODS ARE THEREFORE NEEDED TO TREAT SUCH PATIENTS. GUIDED BY PRECLINICAL DATA SUGGESTING THAT CAVEOLIN-1 (CAV1) \u2013 THE MAIN PROTEIN OF CHOLESTEROL-RICH INVAGINATIONS OF THE PLASMA MEMBRANE \u2013 REDUCES TRASTUZUMAB BINDING TO HER2-POSITIVE EG TUMORS, WE INITIATED RETROSPECTIVE CLINICAL ANALYSES TO VALIDATE CAV1 AS A COMPLEMENTARY BIOMARKER OF HER2. REMARKABLY, KAPLAN-MEIER SURVIVAL ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT HER2+ EG TUMORS EXPRESSING HIGH CAV1 (IHC 2+/3+) HAD WORSE OVERALL SURVIVAL THAN THOSE EXPRESSING LOW CAV1 (IHC 0/+1) AFTER TRASTUZUMAB THERAPY. THESE PROMISING PRELIMINARY RESULTS PROMPTED US TO PHARMACOLOGICALLY DEPLETE CAV1 (WHICH IS PRESENT IN CHOLESTEROL MEMBRANE DOMAINS) WITH LOVASTATIN, A CHOLESTEROL-DEPLETING DRUG. HERE, WE WILL PERFORM RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES OF PATIENTS WITH HER2-POSITIVE EG TUMORS TO ASSESS HER2 EXPRESSION AND HETEROGENEITY, ERBB2 AMPLIFICATION, CAV1 STAINING AND THE PRESENCE OF GENETIC ALTERATIONS (COPY NUMBER VARIATIONS) ASSOCIATED WITH TRASTUZUMAB RESISTANCE. WE WILL ANALYZE MEDICAL RECORDS TO DETERMINE IF CONCURRENT STATIN USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED RESPONSE TO TRASTUZUMAB. IN ADDITION TO RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES, WE WILL PERFORM RANDOMIZED IMAGING AND THERAPEUTIC PRECLINICAL STUDIES USING PATIENT-DERIVED EG XENOGRAFTS (PDXS) REPRESENTING HER2+/CAV1HIGH AND HER2+/CAV1LOW TUMOR POPULATIONS. WE WILL DETERMINE THE MOLECULAR IMAGING PROFILE (89ZR-TRASTUZUMAB PET) AND THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY IN PDXS TREATED WITH (1) CONTROL SALINE, (2) TRASTUZUMAB ALONE, (3) LOVASTATIN ALONE, OR (4) THE COMBINATION OF TRASTUZUMAB WITH LOVASTATIN, TO IDENTIFY MOLECULAR FEATURES THAT CONFER DRUG SENSITIVITY AND RESISTANCE TO THIS PROMISING INVESTIGATIONAL COMBINATION. AIM 1 WILL VALIDATE CAV1 AS A COMPLEMENTARY BIOMARKER TO HER2, AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL DOSIMETRIC IMPACT OF THE STATINS ON CLINICAL IMAGING AND IDENTIFY EG TUMOR POPULATIONS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE TRASTUZUMAB/LOVASTATIN COMBINATION, AND AIM 3 WILL VALIDATE THE USE OF A STATIN AS A NEW PHARMACOLOGIC APPROACH TO HER2-TARGETED IMAGING AND SYSTEMIC RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY (ENDORADIOTHERAPY) CAPABLE OF REDUCING OFF-TARGET RADIATION DOSES. ALL THREE AIMS WILL GENERATE IMPORTANT NEW PRECLINICAL DATA ON THE USE OF STATINS TO IMPROVE TRASTUZUMAB EFFICACY, WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT FOUNDATION FOR MANY FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING CLINICAL TRANSLATION OF TRASTUZUMAB/STATIN COMBINATION THERAPY AND POTENTIAL BROADER APPLICATION TO OTHER HER2+ CANCERS.

COACHING FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROMOTION AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS:  ADAPTING AN EFFICACIOUS INTERVENTION TO PREPARE FOR IMPLEMENTATION - INTERVENTIONS PROMOTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS IMPROVE THEIR FUNCTIONING, REDUCE FATIGUE AND OFFER OTHER BENEFITS IN CANCER RECOVERY AND RISK REDUCTION FOR FUTURE CANCER. THERE IS A NEED FOR INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ON A WIDER-SCALE THAN IN RESEARCH SETTINGS. OUR 12-WEEK THEORY-BASED EXERCISE INTERVENTION THAT WAS DELIVERED BY RESEARCH STAFF BY TELEPHONE WAS EFFICACIOUS IN IMPROVING FITNESS, AND INCREASING MODERATE-TO-VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (MVPA) AMONG BREAST, COLORECTAL AND ENDOMETRIAL CANCER SURVIVORS. TO WIDEN THE INTERVENTION\u2019S REACH, WE TRAINED PEER COACHES IN THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY\u2019S REACH TO RECOVERY PROGRAM TO DELIVER THE SAME MVPA INTERVENTION CALLED MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER (MFT) TO OTHER BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, MFT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED MVPA AND PROVIDED PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS FOR THESE SURVIVORS (PINTO, STEIN & DUNSIGER, 2015). NOW, OUR GOAL IS TO PREPARE FOR WIDER IMPLEMENTATION OF MFT BY AUTOMATING KEY RESOURCE-INTENSIVE COMPONENTS SUCH AS MATCHING SURVIVORS WITH A COACH BY USING A WEB-BASED PEER MENTORING PLATFORM AND TO COLLECT KEY INDICES TO PREPARE FOR LARGE SCALE IMPLEMENTATION. INQUISTHEALTH\u2019S WEB PLATFORM (MENTOR1TO1\u2122) HAS DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN PEER MENTORING FOR CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT (E.G., DIABETES). WE WILL PARTNER WITH INQUISITHEALTH TO ADAPT THEIR WEB PLATFORM FOR MFT. THE AIM IS TO STREAMLINE INTERVENTION DELIVERY, ASSURE FIDELITY AND IMPROVE SURVIVOR OUTCOMES. THERE WILL BE TWO PHASES IN THIS 4-YEAR R01 APPLICATION: IN PHASE 1, WE WILL WORK WITH 6 PEER COACHES WHO HAVE ALREADY DELIVERED MFT (OUR ORIGINAL EVIDENCE-BASED MVPA INTERVENTION) IN PRIOR WORK. USING ITERATIVE USER-CENTERED DESIGN PRINCIPLES, WE WILL MODIFY THE WEB PLATFORM FOR MFT, CREATING WEBMFT. IN PHASE 2, WE WILL CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IN WHICH 10-12 PEER COACHES WILL DELIVER WEBMFT TO 56 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER WEBMFT OR MVPA TRACKING. WE WILL RECRUIT AND TRAIN COACHES NA\u00cfVE TO MFT FROM THREE CANCER CARE ORGANIZATIONS WITH PEER MENTORING PROGRAMS.

WE WILL EXAMINE SURVIVOR OUTCOMES (OBJECTIVELY MEASURED MVPA AND SELF-REPORTED FATIGUE, QUALITY OF LIFE, PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AND MOOD) BY USING MIXED EFFECTS REGRESSION MODELS TO COMPARE GROUPS AT 12 WEEKS. WE WILL OBTAIN SURVIVORS\u2019 FEEDBACK ON THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH WEBMFT. BASED ON THE RE-AIM FRAMEWORK AND PRISM, WE WILL COLLECT DATA ON IMPLEMENTATION INDICES AT THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL BY CONDUCTING KEY MULTI-LEVEL STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS. USING NEWER TECHNOLOGIES FOR ENHANCED INTERVENTION DELIVERY, PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND AUTOMATED DATA COLLECTION HAS THE EXCITING PROMISE OF FACILITATING EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION BY ORGANIZATIONS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. ADAPTING EVIDENCE-BASED MFT TO A CUSTOMIZED WEB PLATFORM AND COLLECTING DATA AT MULTIPLE-LEVELS (COACHES, SURVIVORS AND ORGANIZATIONS) ALONG WITH COSTS WILL PROVIDE A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR A ROBUST MULTI-SITE IMPLEMENTATION TRIAL TO INCREASE MVPA (AND ITS BENEFITS) AMONG MANY MORE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "873ae72b-bace-b481-a973-8304b7346bc0-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01CA242745_7529"}, {"internal_id": 81728612, "Award ID": "R01CA242520", "Award Amount": 2298446.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-06-25", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "A MULTILEVEL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTION FOR SOUTH ASIAN WOMEN AND GIRLS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "89c1b286-4842-cf79-9563-7ec2e987f771-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01CA242520_7529"}, {"internal_id": 82470291, "Award ID": "R01CA241930", "Award Amount": 2714456.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-01", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "MULTISCALE RESOLUTION AND DEEP NETWORK APPROACHES FOR DECONVOLVING DIFFERENT CELL TYPES IN BULK TUMOR USING SINGLE-CELL SEQUENCING DATA (SCDEC)", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "9adce466-3b6d-ecdb-7412-8082d6529b1f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01CA241930_7529"}, {"internal_id": 137122245, "Award ID": "R01CA241845", "Award Amount": 1782038.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-11", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "VALIDATION OF EPIGENOMIC BIOMARKERS FOR THYROID CANCER DIAGNOSTICS - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT EACH YEAR, UP TO 50,000 PATIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES RECEIVE UNNECESSARY THYROIDECTOMIES. THESE UNNECESSARY THYROIDECTOMIES ARE DUE TO DIFFICULTIES IN PREOPERATIVELY DISTINGUISHING BENIGN THYROID NODULES FROM THYROID CANCERS. IN PRELIMINARY DATA, WE DEVELOPED AN EPIGENETIC TEST THAT SHOWS PROMISE TO DISTINGUISH BENIGN VERSUS MALIGNANT THYROID NODULES. HERE, WE WILL RIGOROUSLY TEST AND VALIDATE THE ABILITY OF OUR EPIGENETIC BIOMARKERS TO EVALUATE THE BIOLOGIC AGGRESSIVENESS OF THYROID NODULES AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE NEW EPIGENETIC TESTING WILL IMPROVE THYROID NODULE MANAGEMENT TOWARDS THE ERADICATION OF UNNECESSARY THYROIDECTOMIES. CURRENT MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS FOR INDETERMINATE THYROID NODULES, WHILE PROVIDING SOME IMPROVEMENT, HAVE NOT ELIMINATED THE UNNECESSARY THYROIDECTOMIES. CURRENT MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS ARE BASED ON MOLECULAR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NORMAL THYROID TISSUE AND THYROID CANCER. HOWEVER, BENIGN THYROID NODULES CAN CONTAIN MANY MOLECULAR ALTERATIONS INCLUDING GENE FUSIONS AND MUTATIONS. AS A RESULT, OVER HALF OF THYROID NODULES WITH A SIGNIFICANT CANCER RISK ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT MOLECULAR CLASSIFIERS ARE FOUND TO BE BENIGN AFTER THYROIDECTOMY. IN OUR PUBLISHED PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PERFORMED A GENOME-WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS OF 109 SURGICALLY EXCISED THYROID NODULES AND ADJACENT BENIGN TISSUE. WE FOUND THAT THE DNA METHYLATION PATTERN IN BENIGN NODULES IS DIFFERENT FROM THYROID CANCER AND NORMAL THYROID. BASED ON THE DNA METHYLATION PATTERN SPECIFIC TO BENIGN NODULES AND THE DNA METHYLATION PATTERN SPECIFIC TO THYROID CANCER, WE DEVELOPED THE DIAGNOSTIC DNA METHYLATION SIGNATURE (DDMS) APPROACH TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN BENIGN VERSUS MALIGNANT NODULES. IN A RETROSPECTIVE PILOT STUDY PERFORMED UNDER 1R21CA223367, WE DEVELOPED DDMS FURTHER (DDMS-2). WE TESTED THE ABILITY OF THE DDMS-2 ASSAY TO DISTINGUISH BENIGN FROM MALIGNANT SURGICALLY EXCISED THYROID NODULES (N=121). IN THIS PILOT STUDY, DDMS- 2 HAD AN ESTIMATED POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE (PPV) OF 96% AND A NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE (NPV) OF 98%. GUIDED BY OUR PRELIMINARY DATA, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DDMS (I) CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY USED FOR MOLECULAR THYROID CANCER DIAGNOSTICS OF PRE-OPERATIVE THYROID NODULE ASPIRATIONS; (II) WILL HAVE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN COMPARISON TO CURRENT THYROID CANCER MOLECULAR TESTING AND (III) CAN AFFECT PHYSICIAN DECISION-MAKING TOWARDS ELIMINATION OF UNNECESSARY THYROIDECTOMIES. WE WILL ACCOMPLISH OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE BY PURSUING THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1: TO PERFORM ANALYTICAL VALIDATION OF THE DDMS-2 ASSAY.

THE CONFIDENCE TO PURSUE MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACHES LIKE ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE ARE LIMITED, AS BIOPSY IS KNOWN TO UNDERESTIMATE THE GRADE AND EXTENT OF DISEASE, BOTH OF WHICH ARE IMPORTANT FOR RISK STRATIFICATION. TARGETED BIOPSIES, BY MEANS OF MRI- GUIDANCE, ARE BECOMING THE PREFERRED WAY TO ENSURE THE MOST AGGRESSIVE APPEARING LESIONS ARE SAMPLED IN THE HOPES OF AVOIDING SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH STANDARD BIOPSY APPROACHES. THESE TARGETED BIOPSIES MAKE USE OF MULTI-PARAMETRIC MRI (MPMRI) WHICH INCLUDES BOTH ANATOMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION THAT ARE COMPLIMENTARY AND TOGETHER INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FOR CANCER DETECTION. HOWEVER, THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY USE MPMRI REQUIRES SPECIALIZED TRAINING WHILE THE STANDARDS FOR PROPERLY USING THE MULTIPLE MRI DATASETS ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD THAT WOULD PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE, USER-INDEPENDENT, SUMMARY OF THE MPMRI DATA (QMRI) TO VISUALLY \u201cMAP\u201d DISEASE AND ASSESS ITS AGGRESSIVENESS. USING QUANTITATIVE MRI, A COMPOSITE BIOMARKER SCORE (CBS) MAP IS GENERATED, WITH A DEMONSTRATED INCREASE IN SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FOR TUMOR DETECTION COMPARED TO ANY SINGLE QMRI PARAMETER. OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO INTEGRATE THIS PREDICTIVE QMRI MODEL INTO A COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSTIC (CAD) SYSTEM (REFERRED TO AS CBS-CAD) TO IMPROVE THE USE OF MPMRI IN PCA MANAGEMENT. EMPLOYING QUANTITATIVE MRI (QMRI) CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF A QUALITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS IF THE MAJOR ROADBLOCKS TO ITS ADOPTION CAN BE OVERCOME. TO ADDRESS THE ROADBLOCKS AND IMPLEMENT THE CBS-CAD SYSTEM WE WILL PURSUE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DEVELOP AN ANALYSIS PIPELINE TO EVALUATE QMRI PERFORMANCE AND TRANSLATE CBS-CAD METHODS, 2) PERFORM A MULTI-VENDOR, MULTI-SITE QUANTITATIVE IMAGING TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND 3) PERFORM A MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL VALIDATION STUDY ASSESSING CBS-CAD PERFORMANCE. OUR EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THIS ACADEMIC-INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP WILL BE THE INTEGRATION OF SEVERAL NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES INTO A COMPREHENSIVE CAD SYSTEM CONSISTING OF A PHANTOM AND AUTOMATED SOFTWARE FOR 1)

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE NEW 3D ADVANCED HYPERPOLARIZED (HP) 13C-PYRUVATE MRI TECHNIQUES TO QUANTITATIVELY MONITOR METABOLIC CHANGES IN PROSTATE CANCER FOLLOWING STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIATION THERAPY (SBRT) AND TO STUDY HP 13C + MULTIPARAMETRIC 1H MRI FOR DETECTING RESIDUAL/PROGRESSIVE CANCER FOLLOWING RT, ADDRESSING CURRENT UNMET CLINICAL NEEDS. THIS RESEARCH TRIAL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE RT TOO OFTEN CAUSES EXCESS MORBIDITY WITHOUT SUFFICIENT EFFICACY AND CURRENT IMAGING APPROACHES ARE INADEQUATE IN IDENTIFYING CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CANCER FOLLOWING RT. FDG-PET IMAGING IS SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED IN PROSTATE CANCER SINCE IN THE LOCALIZED SETTING, SIGNIFICANT EXCRETION IN THE BLADDER PRECLUDES THE ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY DETECT SIGNAL WITHIN THE PROSTATE AND EVEN IN THE METASTATIC SETTING THERE IS SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY OF UPTAKE WITH SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF NON- FDG AVID, YET STILL METABOLICALLY ACTIVE AND GROWING TUMORS, FOR REASONS RELATED TO INTRA-CELLULAR UPTAKE AND TRAPPING OF THE FDG TRACER. WHILE WE USE PSMA-PET, TO IDENTIFY METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER, IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE METABOLIC INFORMATION ON PROSTATE CANCER AGGRESSIVENESS AND RESPONSE TO THERAPY THAT HP 13C HAS DEMONSTRATED IN PRECLINICAL AND INITIAL HUMAN STUDIES AT OUR AND OTHER SITES. RECENT PATIENT STUDIES OF THIS EMERGING IMAGING APPROACH AT MULTIPLE SITES WORLD-WIDE HAVE SHOWN REPEATABLE FINDINGS OF GREATLY UP-REGULATED LDH CATALYZED PYRUVATE-TO-LACTATE CONVERSIONS IN CANCER USING THIS SAFE, RAPID, FAST <5 MIN, NON-RADIOACTIVE MOLECULAR HP 13C MRI. IT HAS DEMONSTRATED NOT ONLY FEASIBILITY, BUT ALSO VALUABLE BIOMEDICAL INFORMATION AT COSTS SIMILAR OR LESS THAN PSMA-PET AND OTHER PET EXAMS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO STUDY TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPARAMETRIC (MP) 1H MRI WITH HP 13C-PYRUVATE MRI (HP 13C MPMRI); 1) BEFORE, 3 MONTHS AFTER, AND 1 YEAR FOLLOWING SBRT; AND 2) PATIENTS EXHIBITING \u201cBIOCHEMICAL FAILURE\u201d INDICATED BY A RISING PSA AFTER RADIATION THERAPY WHO ARE GOING ON TO IMAGE-GUIDED BIOPSIES PRIOR TO SELECTION OF FURTHER SALVAGE TREATMENT. WE STRENGTHENED THIS RESUBMISSION BY ADDRESSING THE PRIOR CRITIQUES AND INCLUDING NEW PRELIMINARY DATA APPLYING NEW IMPROVED HP TECHNOLOGY. OUR MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING EARLY PHASE CLINICAL TRIALS AND COMBINES THE EXPERTISE OF PROSTATE CANCER IMAGING SCIENTISTS WITH PHYSICIAN/SCIENTISTS AND RADIATION ONCOLOGISTS TO ADVANCE OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES TO TRANSLATE AND INVESTIGATE NEW HP 13C-PYRUVATE MPMRI TECHNIQUES FOR MONITORING RT RESPONSE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT UNMET CLINICAL NEEDS

DISPARITIES IN CANCER INCIDENCE AND OUTCOMES, THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES OF DISPARITIES IN CANCER GENOMES, WHICH REQUIRES BOTH GERMLINE, SOMATIC, AND CLINICAL DATA FROM THE SAME PATIENTS. HOWEVER, STUDYING ANCESTRY-SPECIFIC GENOMIC ALTERATIONS IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERPINNING MECHANISMS IN CANCER DISPARITY, AND DEVELOP POTENTIAL PREVENTION AND THERAPEUTICS STRATEGIES. DR. CARROT-ZHANG AND OTHERS EVALUATED GENETIC ANCESTRY EFFECTS ON SOMATIC ALTERATIONS AMONG 10,678 PATIENTS ACROSS 33 CANCER TYPES FROM THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS, AND HIGHLIGHTED NOVEL ANCESTRY-SPECIFIC EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES FROM PAN-CANCER AND TISSUE-SPECIFIC ANALYSES. WE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT ANCESTRY ASSOCIATIONS WERE PROFOUNDLY TISSUE SPECIFIC, AND THEREFORE, MORE SAMPLES FROM DIVERSE ANCESTRIES ARE REQUIRED FOR TISSUE-SPECIFIC ANALYSES. TO THAT EXTENT, THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON LARGE SEQUENCING DATA SETS COMPOSED OF 1,153 LUNG CANCER PATIENTS FROM MEXICO AND COLOMBIA, AND 60,085 LUNG CANCER SAMPLES FROM FOUNDATION MEDICINE. OUR OVERALL GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE WELL-KNOWN, BUT MYSTERIOUS, POPULATION-SPECIFIC GENOMIC DIFFERENCES IN LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA. OUR FIRST AIM IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE THE LANDSCAPE OF ANCESTRY EFFECTS ON GENOMIC FEATURES OF LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA, AS WE ARE WELL POWERED TO DETECT NEW ASSOCIATIONS.

CARROT-ZHANG WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL STATISTICAL METHOD LEVERAGING THE LOCAL ANCESTRY (ANCESTRY OF A GENOMIC REGION) FROM ANCESTRY-ADMIXED POPULATIONS TO INFER THE HERITABILITY OF ANCESTRY-ASSOCIATED SOMATIC FEATURES. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GENOMIC DIFFERENCES RELATED TO ANCESTRY. OUR THIRD AIM IS TO ELUCIDATE THE INFLUENCE OF ANCESTRY ON CLINICAL OUTCOME, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PROGNOSTICS AND PRECISION MEDICINE FOR THE MINORITY POPULATIONS. DR. CARROT-ZHANG\u2019S LONG-TERM CAREER GOAL IS TO IMPROVE CANCER PREVENTION, EARLY DETECTION AND TREATMENT BY INTEGRATING COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, GERMLINE GENETICS, AND SOMATIC GENOMICS APPROACHES TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING CANCER INITIATION AND PROGRESSION.

IN FACT, NANOPARTICLE ACCUMULATION IN TUMORS CONTINUES TO BE DISMALLY LOW, WITH LESS THAN 1% OF THE INJECTED DOSE REACHING ITS TARGET. THIS IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLEXITY AND HETEROGENEITY OF BOTH THE BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT AND NANOPARTICLE CONSTRUCTS, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DECONVOLUTE INDIVIDUAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO NANOPARTICLE TARGETING AND ACCUMULATION IN TUMORS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND DEFINE THE ATTRIBUTES THAT DEFINE SUCCESSFUL NANOCARRIERS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY URGENT IN LETHAL CANCERS THAT STAND TO BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY FROM NEW AND TARGETED THERAPIES, LIKE OVARIAN CANCER, WHICH HAS A 25% 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE AND 70% RECURRENCE RATE FOLLOWING CHEMOTHERAPY, OFTEN LEADING TO TREATMENT RESISTANT DISEASE.

THESE BARRIERS PREVENT SCALABLE ANALYSIS OF EHR DATA FOR EVEN RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD RESEARCH TASKS, SUCH AS IDENTIFICATION OF A COHORT OF PATIENTS POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR CLINICAL TRIALS. IDENTIFYING PATIENTS FOR TRIALS IS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE IN CANCER RESEARCH, SINCE UNDER 5% OF ADULTS WITH CANCER HAVE HISTORICALLY ENROLLED IN THERAPEUTIC TRIALS. TOOLS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT TO BETTER MATCH PATIENTS TO TRIALS, BUT NO SUCH TOOLS ARE BOTH PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND CAPABLE OF INCORPORATING TIME- SPECIFIC PATIENT PHENOTYPES GENERATED USING UNSTRUCTURED EHR DATA.

TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, I WILL USE THE FUNDING TO DEDICATE TIME FOR ATTENDING GRADUATE COURSES, WORKSHOPS, TRAINING SEMINARS, GRAND ROUNDS LECTURES, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY REGULAR MEETINGS WITH MY ENTIRE CAREER AWARD TEAM, AS OUTLINED IN MY CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN. THE RESEARCH PROJECT COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL IS DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT RARE CELL POPULATIONS ARE KNOWN TO PLAY AN OUTSIZED ROLE IN MANY OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PROBLEMS IN CANCER, AND DOWNSTREAM PROFILING (I.E., GENOMICS, PROTEOMICS, AND TRANSCRIPTOMICS) OF THESE INDIVIDUAL CELLS CAN THEREFORE ALLOW FOR MORE-EFFECTIVE THERAPIES TARGETED AGAINST THESE OFTEN-HIDDEN LYNCHPINS OF THE DISEASE. DESPITE THIS, SINGLE-CELL ISOLATION (THE PROCESS BY WHICH INDIVIDUAL CELLS ARE TARGETED AND COLLECTED FOR FURTHER STUDY) IS STILL TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING WITH CURRENT METHODS, PARTICULARLY FOR RARE TUMOR CELLS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC, AS THESE RARE TUMOR CELLS OFTEN DICTATE METASTASIS, TREATMENT RESISTANCE, AND RECURRENCE, ALL OF WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULT IN PATIENT MORTALITY. WHILE THIS CHALLENGE EXISTS FOR NEARLY ALL FORMS OF CANCER, THIS PROPOSAL WILL FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON METASTATIC TUMOR CELLS WHICH HAVE INVADED THE LYMPHO-VASCULAR SPACE IN PROSTATE CANCER, AS THE ISOLATION AND ANALYSIS OF THESE RARE CELLS CAN ENABLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT STRATEGIES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, I PROPOSE TO BUILD UPON MY POST- DOCTORAL RESEARCH, AND WITH THE NECESSARY TRAINING ABOVE, DEVELOP A NOVEL LIGHT-SHEET MICRO-ASPIRATION MICROSCOPE WHICH WILL ENABLE THE ISOLATION OF THESE RARE TUMOR CELLS FROM INTACT CLINICAL SPECIMENS FOR THE FIRST TIME.

FATIGUE, MOOD DISTURBANCES), LEADING TO POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). EXERCISE MAY PREVENT PHYSICAL FUNCTION DECLINE AND IMPROVE SYMPTOMS IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH MN. OLDER PATIENTS WITH MN CAN EXERCISE SAFELY, BUT ADHERENCE MAY BE A CHALLENGE. MOBILE HEALTH (MHEALTH) APPLICATION (APP) MAY IMPROVE ADHERENCE BY ENHANCING EXERCISE SELF-EFFICACY AND BY HELPING TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO EXERCISE. INFLAMMATORY DYSREGULATION [SPECIFICALLY TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR (TNF)A AND RELATED CYTOKINES] IS ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICAL FUNCTION DECLINE, FATIGUE, AND MOOD DISTURBANCES. IN THIS K99/R00, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP, ADAPT, AND EVALUATE A NOVEL MHEALTH EXERCISE INTERVENTION FOR PREVENTING PHYSICAL FUNCTION DECLINE, IMPROVING SYMPTOMS, AND PREVENTING WORSENING QOL IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH MN RECEIVING OUTPATIENT HMA, AND TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION ON TNFA AND RELATED CYTOKINE GENE PROMOTER METHYLATION AND THEIR GENE AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: DR. LOH IS AN EMERGING GERIATRIC ONCOLOGIST AND HAS BEGUN TO STUDY MHEALTH AND CANCER CONTROL. TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT CLINICIAN SCIENTIST CONDUCTING MHEALTH BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION RESEARCH FOR OLDER PATIENTS WITH MN, DR. LOH NEEDS TRAINING TO (1) DEVELOP AND ADAPT MHEALTH BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS FOR OLDER PATIENTS WITH CANCER, (2) ACQUIRE SKILLS TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR WHO CAN DESIGN, CONDUCT, AND ANALYZE CLINICAL TRIALS, (3) DEVELOP EXPERTISE IN BIOMARKERS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION. DR. LOH'S MENTORING TEAM HAS EXPERTISE IN GERIATRIC AND EXERCISE ONCOLOGY, BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION RESEARCH, MHEALTH, AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE. THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER IS WORLD-CLASS FOR GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY AND CANCER CONTROL. RESEARCH PLAN: THE PROPOSED MHEALTH EXERCISE INTERVENTION (GO-EXCAP MOBILE APP) INTEGRATES THE CONTENT OF AN ESTABLISHED EXERCISE PROGRAM (EXCAP) WITH A MOBILE APP DELIVERY PLATFORM (TOUCHSTREAM). EXCAP IS A HOME-BASED PROGRESSIVE WALKING AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE PROGRAM. THE TOUCHSTREAM MOBILE APP TRACKS EXERCISE DATA, SYMPTOMS, AND BARRIERS TO EXERCISE ADHERENCE, AND THE EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGIST CAN ADJUST EXERCISE PRESCRIPTIONS AND ADDRESS BARRIERS TO EXERCISE. IN K99, WE WILL FIRST DEVELOP AND ADAPT THE GO-EXCAP MOBILE APP BY OBTAINING FEEDBACK FROM 10 PATIENTS WITH MN RECEIVING HMA. SECOND, WE WILL CONDUCT A SINGLE- ARM PHASE 1 TRIAL TO OPTIMIZE THE GO-EXCAP MOBILE APP IN 25 PATIENTS. IN R00 (PHASE 2 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL), WE WILL ASSESS THE PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF THE GO-EXCAP MOBILE APP VERSUS A CHEMOTHERAPY EDUCATION CONTROL (BEHAVIORAL PLACEBO) ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES (FATIGUE, MOOD, AND QOL) IN 100 PATIENTS. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION ON TNFA AND RELATED CYTOKINE PATHWAYS. IMPACT: THE COMBINED TRAINING AND RESEARCH PLAN WILL POSITION DR.

MOLECULAR IMAGING OF LUNG CANCER - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) IS A DEVASTATING DISEASE WITH A POOR OUTCOME. WHEN A PATIENT IS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH NSCLC, THE PERSON WOULD TYPICALLY UNDERGO DIAGNOSTIC BRONCHOSCOPY AND/OR THERAPEUTIC SURGERY. THESE TWO PROCEDURES HAVE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES THAT LIMIT THEIR SUCCESS SUCH AS INACCURATE BIOPSIES, FAILURE TO LOCATE NODULES AND LYMPH NODES, MISSED OCCULT TUMORS, AND POSITIVE MARGINS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THERE IS A 40% FAILURE RATE FOR THESE PROCEDURES. THIS PROJECT WILL USE OPTICAL IMAGING IN THE NEAR-INFRARED (NIR) RANGE TO GENERATE PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS AND MAKE THESE TWO COMMON PROCEDURES SAFER, MORE EFFICIENT, AND HAVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INTRAOPERATIVE IMAGING IN THE NIR SPECTRUM WITH TARGETED MOLECULAR TRACERS CAN IDENTIFY TUMOR CELLS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PROCEDURES THAT ARE UTILIZED FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH NSCLC. THE INNOVATION OF THIS PROGRAM PROJECT WILL BE IN THE MATRIX OF COCKTAIL DYE DEVELOPMENT, NEW NIR CAMERA DEVICES, AND CLINICAL TRANSLATION. THERE ARE THREE SPECIFIC GOALS OF THIS PROJECT. FIRST, TO DEVELOP A SET OF TARGETED NEAR-INFRARED MOLECULAR IMAGING CONTRAST AGENTS THAT ARE SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC TO A RANGE OF DISTINCT TARGETS ON NSCLC. SECOND, TO DEVELOP AND INTEGRATE HIGHLY NIR SPECTRAL SENSITIVE IMAGING PLATFORMS INTO COMMONLY USED WHITE LIGHT IMAGING DEVICES SO THEY CAN BE UTILIZED DURING CLINICAL PROCEDURES. AND THIRD, TO APPLY THESE INNOVATIONS TO SOLVE COMMON CLINICAL PROBLEMS IN ORDER TO IMPACT PATIENT CARE.

"TRANSLATING THE TUMOR REGULOME FROM CELL-FREE DNA FOR PRECISION ONCOLOGY - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT AN ACCURATE TUMOR CLASSIFICATION IS PIVOTAL TO CLINICAL CANCER CARE AND PRECISION ONCOLOGY. TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE OFTEN INFORMED BY THE PATHOLOGY OR DIAGNOSTIC FROM THE TUMOR TISSUE. A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC CANCER IS THE LIMITED ACCESS TO TUMOR TISSUE BECAUSE SURGICAL BIOPSIES ARE NOT ROUTINELY NOR REPEATEDLY COLLECTED THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THERAPY. HOWEVER, TUMORS CAN UNDERGO DRASTIC MOLECULAR CHANGES DURING METASTATIC PROGRESSION AND RESISTANCE TO THERAPIES. CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA (CTDNA) RELEASED FROM TUMOR CELLS INTO THE BLOOD IS A NON-INVASIVE SOLUTION FOR ADDRESSING CHALLENGES IN TISSUE ACCESSIBILITY. CURRENT RESEARCH AND CLINICAL EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON DETECTING GENOME ALTERATIONS IN CTDNA, BUT THEY DO NOT ALWAYS EXPLAIN TREATMENT FAILURE. TREATMENT-RESISTANT PHENOTYPES ARE DEFINED BY DISTINCT CHANGES IN THE GENETIC AND EPIGENETIC REGULATORY LANDSCAPE, WHICH COLLECTIVELY FORM THE TUMOR REGULOME. CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO COMPREHENSIVELY PORTRAY THE TUMOR REGULOME IN PATIENTS DURING THE COURSE OF THERAPY. WE PROPOSE TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS BY DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE COMPUTATIONAL METHODS AND EPIGENETIC ASSAYS THAT WILL BE EMPLOYED TO PROFILE THE TUMOR REGULOME AND SURVEY THE REGULATION OF RESISTANT PHENOTYPES DIRECTLY FROM CTDNA. OUR METHODS WILL INTEGRATE THE ANALYSIS OF GENOME ALTERATIONS, CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY, TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION, AND DNA METHYLATION FROM THE SAME CTDNA SAMPLE. THIS COST-EFFECTIVE STRATEGY PROVIDES A TEMPORAL WINDOW INTO THE PATIENT\u2019S DISEASE BY MONITORING THE TUMOR EPIGENETIC REGULATION AND ITS CLINICAL PHENOTYPE. THE INNOVATIVE ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS AND MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO INTEGRATE THE MULTI-OMIC DATA EXTRACTED FROM A SINGLE CTDNA ASSAY. WE WILL EMPLOY UNIQUE SYSTEMS AND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR METHODS AND ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF TUMOR MOLECULAR HETEROGENEITY AND TREATMENT RESPONSE. (1) FROM RAPID AUTOPSY STUDIES, WE WILL ASSESS THE CONTRIBUTION OF DNA FROM MULTIPLE METASTATIC LESIONS TO DETERMINE THE KEY SOURCE OF CTDNA. (2) FROM PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFT (PDX) MOUSE MODELS, WE WILL ESTABLISH A REPOSITORY OF HUMAN CTDNA FROM MOUSE PLASMA TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND STUDIES UNDER PDX TREATMENT CONDITIONS USING NOVEL THERAPIES. THIS FRAMEWORK IS GENERALIZABLE TO ADDRESS RESEARCH QUESTIONS RELATED TO TUMOR BIOLOGY AND TREATMENT RESPONSE, INCLUDING MONITORING CANCER-ASSOCIATED PATHWAYS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TARGETED THERAPIES.

SCOTT CANCER CENTER (SSSCC) AT THE LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER IN NEW ORLEANS (LSUHSC-NO). THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL BUILD ONTO OUR EXISTING COLLABORATION, PREPARE ORCI PERSONNEL TO FILL GAPS IN EXPERTISE WHILE PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE OF HIV ASSOCIATED CANCER DIAGNOSTICS AND RESEARCH IN CANCER GENOMICS AND THERAPY. THE SCIENTIFIC FOCUS OF TAMTRP IS RESEARCH AND TRAINING IN MOLECULAR DETECTION/DIAGNOSIS, AND IN QUANTIFYING THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOLOGY OF THE MOST COMMON HIV ASSOCIATED MALIGNANCIES IN TANZANIA, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH INFECTIOUS ETIOLOGY. THE SHORT-TERM GOALS ARE: 1) TO ENHANCE THE ORCI CANCER RESEARCH AND TRAINING INFRASTRUCTURE. 2) INSTITUTE A TRAINING AND MENTORING PROGRAM FOR TANZANIANS TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON CANCERS THAT ARE COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED AT ORCI AND SSSCC. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) PROVIDE INTENSIVE ACADEMIC INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR TWO PHD AND FOUR MASTER'S DEGREE CANDIDATES IN A RELEVANT HIV ASSOCIATED CANCER RESEARCH FIELD. 2) PROVIDE MEDIUM-TERM (THREE TO SIX MONTHS) TECHNICAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR POST-GRADUATES AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN TOPICS RELATED TO MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY, CANCER BIOLOGY, BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS, BIOSTATISTICS, BIO BANKING, CANCER REGISTRY, AS WELL AS CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH. 3) DELIVER TECHNICAL WORKSHOPS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE BASIC, CLINICAL, IMPLEMENTATION, GENOMICS, BIOINFORMATICS, COMPUTATION GENOMICS, EPIDEMIOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS, AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN PARTNER INSTITUTIONS TO ENHANCE THE RESEARCH CAPABILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN TANZANIA.

HOWEVER, CANCER RESEARCH IN ZAMBIA, PARTICULARLY POPULATION-BASED RESEARCH, IS LIMITED, PRIMARILY DUE TO A LACK OF WELL-TRAINED INVESTIGATORS, SUPPORTIVE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ADEQUATE FUNDING. CURRENTLY, ZAMBIA HAS NO CANCER-SPECIFIC RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE WORKFORCE GAP. VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER (VUMC) AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ZAMBIA (UNZA) ARE EXPANDING THEIR LONGSTANDING RESEARCH TRAINING PARTNERSHIP TO ESTABLISH A NEW CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY TRAINING PROGRAM, THE VANDERBILT-ZAMBIA CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM (VZCARE). THE OVERALL GOAL OF VZCARE IS TO DEVELOP A CADRE OF RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS EQUIPPED WITH MODERN KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE TO LEAD CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY RESEARCH AND TRAINING IN ZAMBIA, TO ENCOURAGE US- BASED RESEARCHERS TO ENGAGE IN CANCER RESEARCH IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, AND TO ENSURE LONG-TERM PROGRAM IMPACTS AND SUSTAINABILITY.

CANCER DEATHS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA OCCUR DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM CANCERS THAT ARE PREVENTABLE AND/OR CURABLE INCLUDING LYMPHOMA, CERVICAL CANCER AND BREAST CANCER. ADDRESSING THE SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN OF CANCER REQUIRES A NEW GENERATION OF CANCER RESEARCHERS WHO CAN TEST HYPOTHESES IN THE AFRICAN CONTEXT. THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA PROJECT- MALAWI (UNCPM) HAS A RICH CANCER RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT THAT INCLUDES PARTICIPATION IN THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) U54 CONSORTIUM FOR HIV ASSOCIATED MALIGNANCIES, THE AIDS MALIGNANCY CONSORTIUM, THE INTERNATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC DATABASES TO EVALUATE AIDS (IEDEA), NCI AFRICAN ESOPHAGEAL CANCER CONSORTIUM, AND A USAID-FUNDED CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING STUDY. TO DATE, UNCPM HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS IN CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS, AND IN ESTABLISHING A HANDFUL OF EARLY- CAREER INVESTIGATORS, BUT MOMENTUM IS NEEDED TO BUILD ON THIS FOUNDATION. FIRST, LARGE IMPROVEMENTS IN CANCER CONTROL IN MALAWI REQUIRE APPROACHES THAT EXTEND BEYOND CLINICAL TRIALS TO CANCER OUTCOMES RESEARCH, A BROADER APPROACH THAT REQUIRES UNIQUE SKILLS. AT THIS TIME, THERE ARE FEW CANCER RESEARCHERS WITH BOTH THE NECESSARY CANCER RESEARCH SKILLS AND THE LOCAL EXPERIENCE TO DEVELOP CANCER OUTCOMES SOLUTIONS ADAPTED TO THE MALAWIAN CONTEXT. SECOND, THERE IS NO DEFINED PIPELINE FOR EARLY-CAREER CANCER RESEARCH CAPACITY. FINALLY, THERE ARE FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESSFUL MALAWIAN INVESTIGATORS TO OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE NECESSARY TO BE COMPETITIVE FOR INDEPENDENT RESEARCH FUNDING. TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS, WE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH THE MALAWI CANCER OUTCOMES RESEARCH PROGRAM (M-CORP). THIS APPLICATION IS LED BY UNC IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MALAWI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE (COM) AND IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. M-CORP AIMS TO INCREASE THE CADRE OF TRAINED INVESTIGATORS WHO CAN PURSUE INDEPENDENT RESEARCH CAREERS BY: 1) ESTABLISHING A ROBUST CURRICULUM AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CANCER OUTCOMES RESEARCH SPECIFIC TO THE MALAWIAN ENVIRONMENT AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES; 2) SUPPORTING ADVANCED DEGREES; AND 3) OVERCOMING OBSTACLES TO RESEARCH INDEPENDENCE BY PROVIDING POST- DOCTORAL OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING MENTORED PILOT GRANTS. WE WILL USE A MULTI-PD LEADERSHIP STRATEGY BASED AT BOTH UNC AND UNCPM THAT WILL OPTIMIZE OUR STRENGTHS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF CANCER OUTCOMES RESEARCH. AN EXCEPTIONAL POOL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY MENTORS, A DETAILED PLAN FOR PROGRAM EVALUATION, AND ROBUST, BROAD-BASED PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN UNC AND MALAWIAN INSTITUTIONS ENSURE THAT M-CORP OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET AND WILL ESTABLISH MALAWI AS AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR CANCER OUTCOMES RESEARCH.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f371179b-9f27-8013-f81c-4fd314b1f981-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_D43CA260641_7529"}, {"internal_id": 133585001, "Award ID": "D43CA260640", "Award Amount": 813669.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-05", "CFDA Number": "93.394", "Description": "BIDIRECTIONAL TRAINING TO ENHANCE CANCER RESEARCH CAPACITY IN AFRICA - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANCER MORTALITY RATES ARE PROJECTED TO MORE THAN DOUBLE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) IN THE NEXT TWO DECADES. THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS REQUIRES THAT A KNOWLEDGE BASE BE DEVELOPED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ACT ON THE GROWING CANCER BURDEN IN SSA. WE PROPOSE A TRAINING PROGRAM THAT WILL MAXIMIZE THE RIGOR OF CANCER RESEARCH IN SSA BY TRAINING RESEARCHERS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL CAPACITY THAT WILL GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DETERMINANTS OF CANCER RISK AND OUTCOMES AND IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS OF STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING RISK AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES. THE OVERARCHING GOALS OF THIS TRAINING PROGRAM ARE TO 1) DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES TO ENABLE THE HIGHEST QUALITY CANCER RESEARCH IN AFRICA; 2) TEACH FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS TO THOSE WHO CONDUCT RESEARCH IN AFRICA; AND 3) CREATE A CADRE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN LEAD AND SUPPORT CANCER RESEARCH IN SSA. OUR TRAINING PROGRAM PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN EDUCATIONAL AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THAT WILL MAXIMIZE THE RIGOR OF RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED IN SSA; 2) RECRUIT AND TRAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN BUILD SUSTAINABLE CAREERS IN CANCER RESEARCH; 3) ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THIS TRAINING PROGRAM ON THE CAREER OUTCOMES OF TRAINEES AND PARTICIPANTS. TRAINEES WILL FALL INTO TWO GROUPS. FIRST, WE PROPOSE A PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR (PI) TRACK FOR DOCTORAL LEVEL INVESTIGATORS WHO WILL BE TRAINED TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP IN INDEPENDENT AND COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH. PARTICIPANTS IN THE PI TRACK WILL BECOME PROFICIENT IN RESEARCH OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNANCE AND BUILD THE SKILLS AND A SCIENTIFIC PROJECT FOCUS TOWARD INDEPENDENT EXTRAMURAL GRANT FUNDING. SECOND, A PROJECT MANAGEMENT (PM) TRACK WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT THE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH. PARTICIPANTS IN THE PM TRACK WILL BE QUALIFIED TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF RESEARCH PROJECTS WITHIN SSA HEALTH AND REGULATORY SETTINGS. TRAINING WILL INVOLVE BILATERAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MENTORS AND TRAINEES IN BOTH SSA AND THE US WHO WILL PARTNER TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT BEST RESEARCH PRACTICES. THE TRAINING PROGRAM WILL BUILD ON HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL EXISTING RESEARCH NETWORKS IN SSA: THE AFRICAN BREAST CANCER STUDY (ABCS), THE AFRICAN ESOPHAGEAL CANCER CONSORTUM (AFRECC), THE AFRICAN RESEARCH GROUP IN ONCOLOGY (ARGO), AND THE MEN OF AFRICAN DESCENT AND CARCINOMA OF THE PROSTATE (MADCAP) NETWORK. BUILDING ON MENTORS AND RESEARCH CAPACITY OF THESE NETWORKS, THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE A CORE RESEARCH CURRICULUM KNOWN AS THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT TRAINING AND EDUCATION IN AFRICA (PROMOTE-AFRICA) FRAMEWORK AS WELL AS PROJECT-BASED (FOR THE PI TRACK) OR PRACTICUM-BASED (FOR THE PM TRACK) ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS OTHER EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES TO INDIVIDUALS SEEKING CAREERS AS INDEPENDENT CANCER RESEARCHERS OR PROJECT MANAGERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "be067fa7-a493-7bea-f9cc-e29bd2ccc74a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_D43CA260640_7529"}]
