ELIAS NATIONAL PARK AND PRESERVE (WRST). ECOLOGICALLY, THEY REPRESENT A VITAL SOURCE OF ENERGY AND MARINE-DERIVED NUTRIENTS TO PARK ECOSYSTEMS. CULTURALLY, THEY ARE CENTRAL TO THE TRADITIONS AND SUBSISTENCE PRACTICES OF INDIGENOUS AHTNA AND OTHER RURAL RESIDENTS AFFILIATED WITH THE CR DRAINAGE (FEDERAL SUBSISTENCE USERS) AND ARE VALUED BY MANY ALASKA RESIDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN SEVERAL STATE-MANAGED (ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME, ADF&G) FISHERIES THAT HARVEST CR SOCKEYE. SOCKEYE SALMON OF THE CR ALSO REPRESENT A CRUCIAL ECONOMIC RESOURCE TO THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN CR FISHERIES AND TO THE REGION, WITH SOCKEYE SALMON HARVESTED IN THE COMMERCIAL GILLNET DRIFT FISHERY (WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 84% OF THE ANNUAL CR SOCKEYE SALMON HARVEST) VALUED UP TO $40M ANNUALLY. BY FAR, SOCKEYE SALMON IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT SUBSISTENCE RESOURCE FOR MANY OF THE RURAL ALASKA COMMUNITIES AFFILIATED WITH WRST, AS MEASURED BY MEAN ANNUAL HARVEST WEIGHT PER HOUSEHOLD.FISHERIES THAT HARVEST CR SOCKEYE SALMON ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE SPECIFIED GOALS FOR DRAINAGE-WIDE ESCAPEMENT (DEFINED AS THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF SPAWNING SOCKEYE SALMON), WITH ESCAPEMENT GOALS SPECIFIED WITHIN RANGES NECESSARY FOR CONSERVING AND SUSTAINING LONG-TERM SALMON PRODUCTION AND MAINTAINING NORMAL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING. IN ADDITION TO ESCAPEMENT AMOUNT, ESCAPEMENT IS TO BE MANAGED IN A MANNER THAT MAINTAINS GENETIC AND PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CR SOCKEYE SALMON STOCKS BY ASSURING APPROPRIATE GEOGRAPHIC AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF SPAWNERS THROUGHOUT THE CR DRAINAGE, INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF SOCKEYE SALMON DESTINED FOR SPAWNING GROUNDS IN WRST. THESE STOCK CHARACTERISTICS, AS WELL AS SIZE RANGE, SEX RATIO, AND OTHER POPULATION ATTRIBUTES ARE ENCOMPASSED BY THE CONCEPT OF ESCAPEMENT QUALITY.IN 2018 AND AGAIN IN 2020, UNEXPECTEDLY LOW NUMBERS OF SOCKEYE SALMON RETURNED TO THE CR DRAINAGE SYSTEM FROM THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT, WITH DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES FOR CR FISHERIES AND STAKEHOLDERS. THESE INCLUDED THE UNPRECEDENTED CLOSURE OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY FOR 41 CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN 2018 AND ONLY FISHING SEVEN PERIODS IN 2020; THE FIRST-EVER CLOSURE OF THE STATE SUBSISTENCE FISHERY IN 2018; AND EXPANDED CLOSURES OF THE PERSONAL USE FISHERY IN 2018 AND 2020. IN 2018, CONCERN AMONG FEDERAL SUBSISTENCE USERS ABOUT THE LOW SOCKEYE SALMON RETURN AND IMPACTS OF STATE-MANAGED FISHERIES ON SOCKEYE SALMON STOCKS RESULTED IN UNPRECEDENTED WRITTEN REQUESTS THAT THE WRST SUPERINTENDENT ISSUE EMERGENCY SPECIAL ACTIONS CLOSING ONE OR MORE STATE FISHERIES PURSUANT TO HIS DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM THE FEDERAL SUBSISTENCE BOARD.IN ADDITION TO RECENT RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS OF RETURNING CR SOCKEYE SALMON, THERE HAS BEEN A LONG-TERM DECLINE IN BODY SIZE OF RETURNING CR SOCKEYE SALMON, WHICH MAY BE AN IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO RECENT LOW ESCAPEMENT. SMALLER FISH MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER EN-ROUTE (PRE-SPAWNING) MORTALITY, POTENTIALLY DRIVEN BY IMPACTS OF CHANGING MARINE CONDITIONS (WARMING AND COMPETITION) ON HEALTH PARAMETERS AND THE CAPACITY OF SOCKEYE SALMON TO RESPOND TO CHANGING RIVERINE CONDITIONS (FLOW AND TEMPERATURE REGIMES).IN THIS CONTEXT, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN THE GULF OF ALASKA AND THE CR WATERSHED MAY IMPACT SPAWNING MIGRATION SUCCESS BY SOCKEYE SALMON UNDER FUTURE ECOLOGICAL SCENARIOS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO INTEGRATE PRIOR AND ONGOING RADIO-TELEMETRY DATA ON CR SOCKEYE SPAWNING MIGRATION WITH SEVERAL LONG-TERM ADF&G DATA SETS TO DEVELOP FORECASTING MODELS FOR SOCKEYE THAT WOULD INCORPORATE NEW INFORMATION FROM A RECENTLY AVAILABLE HYDROLOGICAL MODEL DEVELOPED BY USGS.

IF NO BAT ACTIVITY IS FOUND, CERTAIN MINES MAY BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC FOR RECREATION IF OTHERWISE DEEMED SAFE. SUMMARY OF PROJECT SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES:THE RECIPIENTS \"SUBTERRANEAN TEAM\" WILL VISIT EACH MINE AND CONDUCT INTERNAL BIOLOGICAL SURVEYS (PROVIDED ALL SAFETY CONCERNS CAN BE MITIGATED). A LIST OF 16 ABANDONED MINES HAS BEEN DESIGNATED FOR THIS PROJECT. INTERNAL SURVEYS PROVIDE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND COMPREHENSIVE MEANS OF ASSESSING WILDLIFE USE OF SUBTERRANEAN FEATURES. THE SUBTERRANEAN TEAMS ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO DETERMINE TYPE AND SEASONALITY OF BAT USE FROM A SINGLE INTERNAL VISIT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BATS ARE PRESENT DURING THE SURVEY, AN INVESTIGATION OF BAT SIGN AND OTHER PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SITE (E.G., EXTENSIVENESS, COMPLEXITY OF WORKINGS, MICROCLIMATE DIVERSITY, HYDROLOGY) ALLOW THE SURVEYORS TO ASSESS THE AVAILABLE HABITAT QUALITY OF THE FEATURE. THIS IN TURN INFORMS A CLOSURE RECOMMENDATION, WITH CONSIDERATION FOR METHODS AND TIMING OF CLOSURE TO BEST ACCOMMODATE WILDLIFE AND MINIMIZE DISTURBANCE.PERFORMANCE GOALS INCLUDING MILESTONES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES:AN INVESTIGATION OF BAT SIGN WILL OCCUR TO DETERMINE BAT ACTIVITY IN EACH MINE (DROPPINGS, SKELETAL REMAINS, FORAGING REMAINS, ETC.).
