INVASIVE BIGHEADED CARP HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS IN RIVERS BY OUTCOMPETING NATIVE SPECIES, ALTERING HABITATS, AND DECREASING WATER QUALITY, LEADING TO DECREASED FISHERIES TARGETING NATIVE SPECIES AND REDUCTION OF WATERFOWL PRODUCTION. IN ADDITION, THEY CAN BE SAFETY HAZARD TO BOATERS BY JUMPING OUT OF THE WATER WHEN STARTLED. A MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT IF THE BIGHEADED CARPS ENTER THE NORTH AMERICAN GREAT LAKES, THEY WILL CAUSE SIMILAR LARGE EFFECTS THERE. AGE-STRUCTURED STOCK ASSESSMENT MODELING IS AN APPROACH THAT CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE FISH ABUNDANCE AND MORTALITY RATES. THESE MODELS REQUIRE DATA EACH YEAR FOR MANY YEARS OF TOTAL HARVEST AND THE AGE OR SIZE COMPOSITION OF THE HARVEST. IN THE ILLINOIS RIVER, WHICH CONNECTS THE GREAT LAKES TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VIA THE ILLINOIS WATERWAY, THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO ESTIMATE POPULATION ABUNDANCE AND FISHING MORTALITY RATES OF BIGHEADED CARPS TO DETERMINE WHETHER CURRENT CONTROL MEASURES ARE EFFECTIVE IN LIMITING POPULATION EXPANSION IN THE RIVER.
