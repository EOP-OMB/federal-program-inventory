GOAL 3: INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED AND UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES THROUGH MOBILE BEHAVIORAL CARE COORDINATION AND SERVICES BY USING THE MOBILE HEALTH UNIT 3 DAYS PER WEEK (Y1-4) IN TARGETED CATCHMENT AREAS TO CREATE A CONTINUUM OF CARE. GOAL 4: IDENTIFY AND IMPROVE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) FOR TARGET POPULATION THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSESSMENT OF SDOH (Y1-4), RISK STRATIFICATION (Y2-4) AND CARE PATHWAYS (CPW) (Y2-4).

THIS AREA HAS NO EXISTING CCBHC.  THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE 8-COUNTY AREA, AS DOCUMENTED BY THE U.S. CENSUS 2018 AMERICAN COMMUNITY 5-YEAR SURVEY, IS 123,149.  OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT SHOWS INDIVIDUALS IN OUR AREA CONTINUE TO FACE MANY UNMET NEEDS DUE TO THE LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED SERVICES SYSTEM, INCONSISTENT USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES, A LACK OF INSURANCE, POVERTY (WITH 10.46% OF THE POPULATION LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL), AND A LACK OF AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION.  THESE CHALLENGES ARE EXACERBATED BY A PERSISTENT SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS IN THE AREA, INCLUDING PHYSICIANS AND PSYCHIATRISTS.  THE LACK OF PSYCHIATRISTS IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE AND INTENSIFIED BY A STATEWIDE DECLINE IN PSYCHIATRIC BEDS FOR EMERGENT AND CRISIS SERVICES.  ALL COUNTIES WITHIN OUR CATCHMENT AREA ARE PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTHCARE SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSAS) FOR MEDICAID POPULATIONS.  A CHNA BY A LOCAL HEALTH SYSTEM ALSO IDENTIFIES A LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS/SUPPORT SERVICES AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IN NORTH CENTRAL IOWA.  THE LACK OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IS LINKED TO A CRITICALLY HIGH SUICIDE RATE WHICH IS THE NINTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN IOWA AND THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR IOWANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 10 AND 34. FURTHER, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF  SUICIDE DEATHS SINCE 2000, GROWING FROM 288 TO 521 IN 2019, AND GROWING STILL FURTHER DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  FROM MARCH TO AUGUST 2020 ALONE, 267 SUICIDE DEATHS WERE REPORTED IN IOWA.  CONCURRENTLY, ALCOHOL-AND DRUG-RELATED HOSPITALIZATION RATES CONTINUE TO GROW.  ISSUES ARE PARTICULARLY ACUTE AMONG OUR VETERANS, WHO MAKE UP NEARLY 7.6% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION.  PRAIRIE RIDGE HAS DESIGNATED FOUR GOALS WITH MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR CATCHMENT AREA AND OUR FOCUS POPULATIONS.

THE POPULATION OF MHCGM\u2019S SERVICE AREA MAKES UP ABOUT 15% OF THE POPULATION OF THE STATE AND IS VERY UNIQUE DEMOGRAPHICALLY AND SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY.  THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 45,000 INDIVIDUALS IN THE SERVICE AREA WHO LIVE AT OR BELOW 200% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL. THIS POPULATION IS LARGER THAN ALL TOWNS OR CITIES IN NH BUT NASHUA AND AN EVEN LARGER POPULATION THAN TWO COUNTIES IN THE STATE.  THE MAJORITY OF THE 207K PEOPLE WITHIN OUR SERVICE AREA LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY ATLAS NUMBERS PROJECT GENERATIONAL POVERTY AND A LOWERED LIFE EXPECTANCY.

ACTIVITIES FOR THE FUNDING INCLUDE MOVING FROM THREE EHRS TO ONE FOR THE ENTIRE AGENCY, DEVELOPING A SINGLE INTAKE PROCESS, PROVIDING OPEN RATHER THAN SCHEDULED ACCESS TO CARE, AND ADDRESSING WORKFORCE ISSUES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO STAFF AND CONSUMER TURNOVER. TARGET POPULATIONS INCLUDE CONSUMERS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS, A SEVERE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER, AND YOUTH WITH SEVERE EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE.  OTHER POPULATIONS WHO WILL BENEFIT ARE THOSE EXPERIENCING DISENFRANCHISEMENT, SUCH AS MINORITIES, HOMELESS, AND FORMER MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR OR OTHERWISE DISENCHANTED WITH VA SERVICES. BECAUSE THESE POPULATIONS CAN BE HIGH-NEEDS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, IMPACTS ON QUALITY OF CARE WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT OTHER COMMUNITY SYSTEMS, SUCH AS HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, JAIL, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.  OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDE: 1) IMPLEMENTATION OF A SINGLE EHR TO REPLACE THREE EHRS CURRENTLY IN USE. THIS WILL ALLOW THE COORDINATION OF CARE BETWEEN PROVIDERS OF THE MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES CURRENTLY OFFERED IN THE AGENCY. 2) REACHING CONSUMERS WHEN AND WHERE THEY ARE READY FOR SERVICES BY DECREASING THE TIME BETWEEN INITIAL CONTACT AND SERVICE DELIVERY FROM DAYS TO HOURS. CURRENT TIME BETWEEN FIRST CONTACT AND ASSESSMENT IS ABOUT 2 WEEKS FOR STANDARD BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. TESTS OF OPEN ACCESS HAVE INDICATED THAT THIS TIME CAN BE REDUCED TO THE SAME DAY BY ADJUSTING THE PROCESS FOR INTAKE AND A 5% INCREASE IN STAFFING. IMPLEMENTING THIS ACROSS ALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WOULD PROVIDE AN INCREASE IN ACCESS TO SERVICES. 3) SERVING AN ADDITIONAL 490 CONSUMERS EACH YEAR OF THE GRANT, A 20% INCREASE OVER THE 2,450 ALREADY SERVED. 4) REDUCING STAFF TURNOVER BY 30%.

SEABHS REMAINED THE MAJOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER FOR THESE COUNTIES FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS, PROVIDING THE FULL RANGE OF OUTPATIENT AND SPECIALTY SERVICES WITH GROSS ANNUAL REVENUE IN EXCESS OF $35 MILLION. ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO, THE PRIMARY FUNDER FOR THIS REGION CHANGED FROM AN ARIZONA-BASED NONPROFIT TO A NATIONAL FOR-PROFIT ENTITY WHICH INTRODUCED A DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY THAT INVOLVED BRINGING IN NEW SERVICE PROVIDERS AND SEVERELY LIMITING LOCAL ACCESS TO SPECIALTY SERVICES.  AS A RESULT, PROVIDERS HAVE STRUGGLED FINANCIALLY, AND MOST SPECIALTY SERVICES WERE SHIFTED TO TUCSON, WHICH IS THE CLOSEST METROPOLITAN AREA, BUT IS IN EXCESS OF 50 MILES AWAY. SEABHS WENT FROM BEING A COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE PROVIDER TO AN INTEGRATED PROVIDER OF PRIMARY CARE AND BASIC OUTPATIENT SERVICES WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF ROUGHLY $7 MILLION.

PRIOR TO THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT, MARK TWAIN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS A 45-YEAR RECORD AS A COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTER SERVICING RURAL NORTHEAST MISSOURI. OUR MAIN PROGRAMMING HAS HISTORICALLY FOCUSED ON SEVERE AND PERSISTENT MENTALLY ILL ADULT AND SED YOUTH CONSUMERS WITH EXPANSION IN CO-OCCURRING SERVICE DELIVERY SINCE 2007. MTBH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI AND SECOND IN THE NATION TO HAVE A CARF APPROVED HEALTHCARE HOME PROGRAM WITH A DEMONSTRATED SUCCESSFUL TRACK RECORD OF MANAGING INTEGRATED MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR CONSUMERS. SINCE MTBH BEGAN ITS JOURNEY OVER TWO YEARS AGO AS A CERTIFIED COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC (CCBHC), THE ORGANIZATION HAS EXPANDED FROM SERVING 3,500 CONSUMERS ANNUALLY TO OVER 9,000 CONSUMERS BY 2019. WE HAVE THREE PHYSICAL SITES LOCATED IN THE NORTHEAST MISSOURI COMMUNITIES OF HANNIBAL, KIRKSVILLE, AND MACON. OUR BROAD SERVICE AREA IS COMPRISED OF THE HRSA DESIGNATED RURAL COUNTIES OF ADAIR, CLARK, KNOX, LEWIS, MACON, MARION, SCHUYLER, SCOTLAND, AND SHELBY - A REGION DESIGNATED BY HRSA AS A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA). MTBH IS DESIGNATED AS THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT BY THE MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH FOR SERVICE AREA 14, WHICH INCLUDES THESE 9 COUNTIES. MTBH TARGETS SERVICES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY\u2019S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION OF SMI ADULTS AND CHILDREN THAT ARE UNDER- INSURED AND UNINSURED. DEMOGRAPHICS OF CLIENTS SERVED BY THE THREE MTBH SITES INCLUDE 95% CAUCASIAN, 3% AFRICAN AMERICAN, AND 2% LATINO, WHICH IS REFLECTIVE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION IN THE REGION. BEGINNING IN 2014, KIRKSVILLE HAS HAD AN INFLUX OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND REFUGEES FROM THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REGION AND REPUBLIC OF CONGO WHICH CHALLENGES EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, BUSINESS, LAW ENFORCEMENT, ETC. OVERALL, POVERTY RATES IN THE AREA RANGE FROM 15-26 %, WHICH EXCEEDS BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL RATES. THE MAJORITY OF CONSUMERS\u2019 ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH MEDICAID, MEDICARE AND A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CLIENTS ARE COVERED THROUGH EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTED INSURANCE PROGRAMS SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP) AND OTHERS ARE SELF-PAY/ SLIDE DUE TO LACK OF INSURANCE. THE PROJECT GOAL IS TO RECRUIT QUALIFIED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE TO MEET THE EXPONENTIAL VOLUME OF ENCOUNTERS/CLIENTS UTILIZING OUR SERVICES IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. THE INITIAL PHASE WILL INVOLVE THE RECRUITMENT AND HIRING OF 4  MASTER\u2019S LEVEL CLINICIANS, CRISIS OUTREACH WORKERS, DUE TO THE RISE IN SUICIDE CLUSTERS IN NORTHEAST MISSOURI.

OUR SECONDARY GOAL IS TO USE THE EXPERIENCE AND DATA FROM THIS PROJECT, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR PAYER DCOS, TO CREATE VALUE-BASED PAYMENT MODELS. CURRENT DATA STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT GRANT-FUNDED GAP CARE HAS BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION FOR A COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH PATTERNS OF FREQUENT USE. BHN PROPOSES TO FULLY REFINE AND CONTINUE TO MEASURE IMPACT FROM OUR EXISTING CCBHC EXPANSION GRANT, FUNDING THAT ENABLED US TO INTEGRATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND CARE MANAGEMENT; FILL GAPS IN UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO CARE COORDINATION AND TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT; AND IMPLEMENT MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. CENTRAL TO THE 2021 CCBHC EXPANSION WILL BE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CREATING A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (BH) URGENT CARE CENTER TO DIVERT PERSONS FROM INAPPROPRIATE ED UTILIZATION FOR BH CRISIS SERVICES AND STABILIZATION. BHN IS THE EMERGENCY SERVICES PROVIDER IN THE SOUTHERN PIONEER VALLEY OF WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS. WE ARE IN THE PLANNING STAGE OF CREATING THE NEW MODEL OF CARE TO SUPPORT HIGH RISK, HIGH NEED FREQUENT UTILIZERS OF BH SERVICES. THIS NEW AMBULATORY URGENT CARE CENTER AND ENHANCED COMMUNITY CRISIS STABILIZATION (CCS) WILL DECREASE ED UTILIZATION FOR CRISIS INTERVENTIONS. BHN WILL APPLY TO RUN A MOBILE INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE (MIH) PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY EMS PROVIDER IN ORDER TO DIVERT SERVICES TO BHN. WE WILL ALSO OFFER MEDICATION STABILIZATION, PSYCHIATRY SERVICES, AND ASSESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS NEEDS AND PROVIDE LINKAGES TO CARE. COMFORT MEDICATIONS FOR DETOXIFICATION WITHDRAWAL WILL BE OFFERED AS CLIENTS WAIT ON BED AVAILABILITY. BHN AND OUR MEDICAL PARTNERS WILL DEVELOP SERVICES IN COLLABORATION WITH THE MA EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (EOHHS). EOHHS LAUNCHED A PLAN IN MAY, 2019 TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT AN AMBULATORY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT SYSTEM. THEY HOSTED 8 LISTENING SESSIONS, SOLICITED WRITTEN FEEDBACK AND IS WORKING WITH PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP A ROADMAP FOR CRITICAL CHANGES NEEDED IN THE COMMONWEALTH.

ARKANSAS HAS THE LARGEST POPULATION OF MARSHALLESE OUTSIDE THE MARSHALL ISLANDS AND A GROWING LATINX POPULATION BOTH ATTRACTED BY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT AND FACTORY WORK. WASHINGTON AND BENTON COUNTIES ARE THE HOME TO SEVERAL LARGE EMPLOYERS (INCLUDING WALMART AND TYSON FOODS) AND HAVE A POPULATION OF OVER 500,000. WHILE THIS IS A MORE DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE AREA OF ARKANSAS IT IS ALSO REFLECTIVE OF THE STATE\u2019S LARGE NUMBER OF SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL INCLUDING THOSE WITH SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS. ARKANSAS RATE OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IS HIGHER THAN THE US AVERAGE. AND, STRIKINGLY, IN 2017 ARKANSAS WROTE 105.4 OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS FOR EVERY 100 PERSONS AT NEARLY DOUBLE THE US AVERAGE.
