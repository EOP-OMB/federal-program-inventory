THE PROJECT INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A MULTI-MOTOR LIFT PUMP STATION EQUIPPED WITH FISH SCREENS, AND 800 FEET OF TRENCHED PIPELINE LEADING FROM THE PUMP STATION TO A NEW WATER DISTRIBUTION BASIN THAT WILL BE BUILT TO PROVIDE REFUGE STAFF THE MEANS FOR EFFICIENT DISPERSAL AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PUMPED WATER FOR EFFECTIVE WETLAND MANAGEMENT. THIS WILL IMPROVE OVERALL HABITAT CONDITIONS FOR WATERFOWL AND ALL THE OTHER MAJOR BIRD GROUPS UTILIZING SUTTER NATIONAL WILDLIFE  REFUGE. BENEFICIARIES INCLUDE MIGRATORY WATERFOWL, SHOREBIRDS, AND WATERBIRDS  STATE AND FEDERALLY-LISTED SPECIES  OTHER WETLAND-DEPENDENT WILDLIFE  AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE PUMP STATION WILL BE BUILT ON LAND OWNED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WITH THE PLANNED PIPELINE TAKING THE PUMPED WATER FROM THE STATE LAND ONTO THE ADJACENT REFUGE. THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE AND U.S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON A LONG-TERM SOLUTION FOR SUPPLYING CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT IMPROVEMENT ACT WATER TO SUTTER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, FOR WHICH A MEANS OF CONVEYANCE DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST. THIS PROJECT WILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDE A RELIABLE MEANS OF DELIVERING WATER TO THE HABITAT UNITS ONCE THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT IMPROVEMENT ACT WATER IS SECURED AND CONVEYED TO THE REFUGE. AN INITIAL AWARD WAS MADE IN 2020 TO DUCKS UNLIMITED, INC.
