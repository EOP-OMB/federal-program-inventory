FOUNDED IN 2006, THE PARTNERSHIP IS RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN BRINGING TOGETHER INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF PERINATAL CARE. THE PARTNERSHIP WORKS THROUGH A VARIETY OF COMMITTEES TO DEVELOP NEW PROGRAMS, IMPROVE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICE STANDARDS OF CARE TO CREATE THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE FOR PREGNANT MOTHERS AND THEIR BABIES. THE WVPP IS GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH IS DIRECTLY ADVISED BY A STATEWIDE CENTRAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  THE WVPP IS PROPOSING TO INCREASE IMPLEMENTATION OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (QI) INITIATIVES IN BIRTHING FACILITIES STATEWIDE, INCLUDING IN FACILITIES SERVING AREAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY ADVERSE PERINATAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. WEST VIRGINIA MOTHERS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY TO HAVE A PRETERM BIRTH WITH A LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABY. WHEN BROKEN DOWN BY RACE, INSTANCES OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND PRETERM BIRTH ARE EVEN HIGHER AMONG BLACK RESIDENTS.

IN 2020, THE NON-HISPANIC BLACK INFANT MORTALITY RATE WAS 13.2 DEATHS, COMPARED TO 6.0 NON-HISPANIC WHITE INFANT DEATHS, AND 5.5 HISPANIC INFANT DEATHS PER 1000 LIVE BIRTHS. ACCORDING TO DATA COMPILED BY HRSA FOR REGION V, IF INDIANA CONTINUES THE CURRENT TREND LINES FOR NON-HISPANIC WHITE AND NON-HISPANIC BLACK INFANT MORTALITY RATES, NON-HISPANIC BLACK INFANTS WILL HAVE TO WAIT 38 YEARS TO ACHIEVE THE 2019 NON-HISPANIC WHITE INFANT MORTALITY RATE. IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN THOUGH THE RATES CONTINUE TO DECLINE, INDIANA MUST DO MORE TO CLOSE THE WIDE GAP BETWEEN POPULATION GROUPS. INDIANA ALSO EXPERIENCES SIGNIFICANT MATERNAL DEATHS. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORT AUTHORED BY THE INDIANA\u2019S MATERNAL MORTALITY COMMITTEE, 60 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DEATHS OCCURRED DURING PREGNANCY OR WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE END OF PREGNANCY. INDIANA SEES 85% OF PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DEATHS OCCURRED DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD, INCLUDING 56% AFTER 6 WEEKS.

IN JUNE OF 2019, GOVERNOR NORTHAM ANNOUNCED A GOAL TO GET RID OF THE RACIAL DISPARITY IN THE MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE IN VIRGINIA BY 2025. THE CURRENT DISPARITY SHOWS THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE RELATED TO PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM RELATED COMPLICATIONS IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA. SEVERAL ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOTED IN THE MOST RECENT VIRGINIA MATERNAL MORTALITY REVIEW TEAM (MMRT) REPORT, PUBLISHED IN 2019, FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE COORDINATION OF CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES IN PREGNANT AND POST-PARTUM WOMEN ALL FOUND TO DIRECTLY IMPACT MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY.  SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE (1) INCREASING PROVIDER AND SPECIALIST TRAINING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC CHRONIC CONDITIONS IN PREGNANT AND POST-PARTUM WOMEN, (2) IMPROVING THE ACCESSIBILITY OF WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH SPECIALISTS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, (3) ALL PROVIDER WHO SEE WOMEN OF CHILD-BEARING AGE ARE TRAINED IN MENTAL HEALTH, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SCREENING, AND (4) DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNICATION PLAN FOR PROVIDERS, COMMUNITIES AND PATIENT RELATED TO AWARENESS OF MATERNAL MORTALITY & MORBIDITY. ADDITIONALLY, IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT FACILITATE THE COORDINATION OF CARE AND PATIENT NAVIGATION, INCLUSIVE OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF BARRIERS TO CARE AND THE PROVISION OF REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED BARRIERS, IS IMPORTANT. THE CDC HAS RECOGNIZED THAT WHILE DATA IS ESSENTIAL, IT MUST BE USED TO DRIVE ACTION AND THE VNPC IS THE ACTION ARM OF THE MMRT.  IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FOURTH TRIMESTER PROJECT, THE VNPC OPERATIONALIZED THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MMRT, FOCUSING ON (1) REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, (2) PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH, (3) MATERNAL HEALTH, (4) HUMAN MILK FEEDING, AND (5) PREVENTION AND EDUCATION ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE OF PREGNANCY THROUGH TRANSITION FROM POST-PARTUM CARE BACK TO WELL WOMEN CARE.

TO IMPROVE PERINATAL HEALTH AND ADDRESS DISPARITIES, POPULATION-LEVEL PERINATAL QI INITIATIVES, WITH A FOCUS ON ENSURING AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS, ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR OHIO\u2019S WOMEN AND INFANTS AFFECTED BY OPIOID USE DISORDER (OUD) BECAUSE THROUGHOUT EACH WAVE OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC, OHIO HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT STATES. THE CDC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THE US OPIOID CRISIS ON MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH AND EMPHASIZED THE KEY ROLE OF PERINATAL QUALITY COLLABORATIVES IN IMPROVING CARE AND OUTCOMES FOR THIS POPULATION.  THE OHIO PERINATAL QUALITY COLLABORATIVE (OPQC) WILL WORK TO MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF PREGNANT WOMEN ENROLLED IN MEDICAID IN THE STATE OF OHIO. IN YEAR 1 OF THE AWARD, WE WILL WORK TO: (1) IMPROVE IDENTIFICATION OF PREGNANT MEDICAID ENROLLEES WITH OUD, 2) LINK THEM TO NEEDED SERVICES (MEDICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND SOCIAL), AND 3) ENSURE RECEIPT OF NARCAN DURING PREGNANCY AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER DELIVERY. THESE OBJECTIVES ALIGN WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE OHIO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (ODH)\u2019S PREGNANCY ASSOCIATED MORTALITY REVIEW REPORT AND THE ALLIANCE FOR INNOVATION IN MATERNAL HEALTH (AIM) OUD BUNDLE.  THERE IS STRONG RATIONALE TO FOCUS ON PREGNANT MEDICAID-ENROLLED WOMEN WITH OUD IN OHIO DUE TO INCREASED RISK OF PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DEATHS AND DEMONSTRATED DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO TREATMENT, ESPECIALLY AMONG BLACK PREGNANT WOMEN.

THE PRAF INCLUDES DATA ON SUBSTANCE USE SCREENING, UTILIZATION OF TREATMENT, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, MEDICAL RISK FACTORS, AND DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING RACE, ETHNICITY, AGE, AND PLACE OF RESIDENCE.  OF THE 27,842 PRAFS SUBMITTED BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2021 AND APRIL 30, 2022, 11,281 (40%) INDICATED A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES OR SUPPORT, AND 1012 (3.6%) INDICATED A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD).  OF THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH OUD, 42% WERE NOT IN TREATMENT. THE DEMOGRAPHICS BY RACE WERE 50.9% WHITE, 40.7% BLACK, AND 6.9% HISPANIC, CONTRASTING WITH OHIO 2020 CENSUS DATA OF 81.7% WHITE, 13.1% BLACK, AND 4.0% HISPANIC.

THE GOAL OF THE INITIATIVE IS TO ENSURE ALL BIRTHING POPULATIONS IN CA MEET THE HEALTH PEOPLE 2030 GOAL OF 23.6%. THE STATEWIDE NTSV RATE FOR 2020 IS 23.3%. HOWEVER, THIS NTSV RATE MASKS SUBSTANTIAL NTSV VARIATIONS RANGING FROM 10% - 41.7% AND THE BLACK NTSV RATE OF 26.8%.

THE PERCENT OF PREGNANT WOMEN WHO RECEIVE PRENATAL CARE BEGINNING IN THE 1ST TRIMESTER ON GUAM REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED SINCE 2015 AT 60.9%, AND THE PERCENT OF WOMEN WHOSE PRENATAL CARE INITIATION WAS LATE OR RECEIVED NO PRENATAL CARE ALSO REMAINED UNCHANGED AT 13.4%. A STUDY WHICH EXAMINED REASONS FOR THE LACK OF PRENATAL CARE AMONG WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE ON GUAM SHOWED THAT LACK OF MEDICAL INSURANCE (24.3%) AND LACK OF TRANSPORTATION (22.6%) WERE THE MAIN REASONS GIVEN BY RESPONDENTS.

THE NYSPQC IS A STATEWIDE LEARNING COLLABORATIVE LED BY NYSDOH WITH A MISSION TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR PREGNANT, BIRTHING, AND POSTPARTUM PEOPLE AND INFANTS IN NYS. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY EMPOWERING BIRTHING FACILITIES TO IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES FOR QUALITY CARE IN CLINICAL PRACTICE WITH A FOCUS ON REDUCING DISPARITIES. NYSPQC\u2019S WORK INCLUDES PRENATAL AND POSTPARTUM PROVIDERS, COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, PATIENT ADVOCATES, AND OTHER INTEGRAL LINKAGES TO PERINATAL CARE. NYSPQC FACILITATES COLLABORATIVE LEARNING AMONG FACILITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DISSEMINATE SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTIONS, POLICIES, AND PRACTICE CHANGES. PROJECTS ARE GUIDED BY MULTIDISCIPLINARY, DIVERSE ADVISORY GROUPS. THE 2019 NYS INFANT MORTALITY (IM) RATE WAS 4.3 DEATHS/1,000 LIVE BIRTHS. WHILE THIS RATE COMPARES FAVORABLY WITH THE 2019 US RATE OF 5.6/1,000, DISPARITIES EXIST.

INFANT MORTALITY WAS HIGHER AMONG THOSE WITH MEDICAID (4.9) AND SELF-PAY (12.7) THAN BIRTHS COVERED BY PRIVATE INSURANCE (3.3). INFANTS WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE IN THE NEONATAL (0-27 DAYS) PERIOD (2.9) THAN POST-NEONATAL (28-364 DAYS) (1.5), AND BLACK NON-HISPANIC INFANTS (5.9) WERE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO DIE IN THE NEONATAL PERIOD THAN WHITE INFANTS (2.2).1 RECEIPT OF COMPONENT A WILL INCREASE NYSPQC\u2019S CAPACITY TO CONDUCT POPULATION-LEVEL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (QI) INITIATIVES WHILE ENSURING AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS.

NEP WILL ENGAGE BIRTHING FACILITIES WITH A NICU, REPRESENTING 86% OF NYS\u2019 ANNUAL BIRTHS. THE STRATEGIES OF THE NEP WILL FOCUS ON: BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING CAPACITY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PERINATAL CARE; ENGAGING FACILITIES STATEWIDE TO IMPROVE PERINATAL OUTCOMES; SUPPORTING FACILITIES TO IMPLEMENT QI INITIATIVES; BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING DATA SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE THE IDENTIFICATION OF DISPARITIES; ENGAGING PATIENTS/FAMILY/COMMUNITY; AND CONDUCTING OUTREACH AND DISSEMINATION OF QI RESULTS. SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO: INCREASE IMPLEMENTATION OF QI INITIATIVES IN FACILITIES STATEWIDE WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THOSE SERVING DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED POPULATIONS; INCREASING IMPLEMENTATION OF QI INITIATIVES TO REDUCE DISPARITIES; AND INCREASING PATIENT/FAMILY/COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING QI INITIATIVES.
