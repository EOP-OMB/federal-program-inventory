OUR PROJECT, WHICH IS INSPIRED BY THAT CHALLENGE, FOCUSES ON EVENTS TRANSPIRING IN THE EARLIEST RADIOGRAPHICALLY-DETECTED MANIFESTATION OF LUNG CANCER: THE COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY (CT)-DETECTED NON- SOLID NODULE, OF WHICH AS MANY AS 40% HARBOR FRANKLY INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA. THUS, DESPITE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT CT-DETECTED NON-SOLID NODULES REPRESENT PRE OR MINIMALLY INVASIVE MALIGNANCY, CLEARLY TRANSITION TO MORE INVASIVE HISTOLOGIES OCCURS IN A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THESE NODULES. UNDERSTANDING THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR CHANGES WITHIN NON-SOLID NODULES THAT DRIVE PROGRESSION WILL PROVIDE UNIQUE AND NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS OF LUNG CARCINOGENESIS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ALTERATIONS IN CELLS OF THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT (TME) HAVE A ROLE IN INITIATING AND SUPPORTING THIS PROGRESSION. IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT PROPOSAL, OUR PRELIMINARY MULTIPLEX IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE (IF) STUDIES SUGGEST THAT PROGRESSION TO A MORE INVASIVE PHENOTYPE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE TME. IN THIS PROJECT WE TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL METHODS TO PROFILE THE TME AND TO DETERMINE THE CROSSTALK BETWEEN CANCER CELLS AND THE TME IN PRE-INVASIVE TO INVASIVE HUMAN LUNG NON-SOLID ADENOCARCINOMAS. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISTINCT HISTOLOGICAL STAGES WILL LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION OF THE CRITICAL EVENTS TRIGGERING PROGRESSION AND THEREBY IDENTIFY TARGETS TO INTERCEPT DISEASE PROGRESSION. WE WILL USE APPROPRIATE MOUSE MODELS IN PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES TO DEVELOP THESE TARGETS AS STRATEGIES TO INTERCEPT PROGRESSION OF PRE-INVASIVE TO INVASIVE CANCER.

WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT: 1) CELLULAR PROCESSING OF CISPLATIN GENERATED METABOLIC STRESS IS A CRITICAL DRIVER OF SENSITIVITY AND/OR RESISTANCE AND 2) COORDINATED GENOMIC (TP53 MUTATION) AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC (NRF-2 ACTIVATION) REPROGRAMMING IS ESSENTIAL TO ORGANIZING THE METABOLIC RESPONSE TO CISPLATIN GENERATED STRESS. H-CARR BRINGS TOGETHER OUR BIOLOGICAL AND METABOLIC MODELS OF CISPLATIN RESISTANCE AND OUR TRANSLATIONAL CAPABILITIES TO IMAGE TUMOR METABOLISM NON-INVASIVELY AND DETECT BIOLOGICAL SHIFTS USING CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS (CTCS), TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE WINDOW INTO ACQUISITION OF CISPLATIN RESISTANCE AS OUTLINED IN THE PROJECTS LISTED BELOW, SUPPORTED BY A ROBUST ADMINISTRATIVE AND ANALYTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ORGANIZED INTO 3 CORES. PROJECT 1 WILL USE STATE OF THE ART METABOLOMIC STUDIES TO IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL METABOLIC DEPENDENCIES OF CISPLATIN RESISTANT HNSCC, IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFECTIVE METABOLIC INHIBITION AND IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CROSS-TALK BETWEEN THE ACQUISITION OF CISPLATIN RESISTANCE AND MODULATION OF THE TUMOR IMMUNE MICROENVIRONMENT. PROJECT 2 WILL EXPLORE THE GENOMIC AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC REPROGRAMMING REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN THE METABOLIC SHIFTS WHICH ACCOMPANY DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE AND INTERROGATE HOW NRF-2 DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT SIGNALING DRIVES RESISTANCE AND ENHANCED DISTANT METASTASIS THROUGH INTRINSIC CELLULAR MECHANISMS AND PARACRINE SIGNALING BETWEEN TUMOR CELLS AND ADRENERGIC NEURONS. PROJECT 3 WILL TEST WHETHER THE METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING OUTLINED IN PROJECT 1 IS DETECTABLE VIA NON-INVASIVE IMAGING (HYPERPOLARIZED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING) AND WHETHER THE BIOLOGICAL SHIFTS OUTLINED IN PROJECT 2 DUE TO CLONAL EXTINCTION AND EXPANSION CAN BE DETECTED USING CTC ANALYSIS IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CISPLATIN-BASED TREATMENT.  H-CARR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REALIZE THE FULL CLINICAL UTILITY OF CISPLATIN BY IDENTIFYING ACQUISITION OF RESISTANCE EARLY DURING TREATMENT AND DEVELOPING THE MEANS TO OVERCOME THIS AND ASSOCIATED PHENOTYPES SUCH AS ENHANCED DISTANT METASTASIS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS WILL GENERATE THE NEW CLINICAL STANDARD FOR PRECISION ONCOLOGY APPROACHES TO CLINICAL UTILIZATION OF CISPLATIN IN HNSCC AND RELATED UPPER- AERODIGESTIVE TRACT CANCERS OF THE LUNG AND ESOPHAGUS AND THEREFORE HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON CANCER SURVIVAL WORLDWIDE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "07c08a07-af34-2853-20eb-9d2594ed7b35-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U54CA274321_7529"}, {"internal_id": 152370172, "Award ID": "U54CA274220", "Award Amount": 1356890.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-20", "CFDA Number": "93.353", "Description": "ACQUIRED RESISTANCE TO THERAPY AND IRON (ARTI) CENTER - OVERALL SUMMARY APPROXIMATELY 50% OF CANCER PATIENTS ARE TREATED WITH RADIATION THERAPY (RT), BUT LOCAL RECURRENCE CAN STILL OCCUR EVEN WITH THE USE OF ADVANCED RT TECHNIQUES. THIS LOCAL RECURRENCE, WHICH COMMONLY DEVELOPS IN 30-50% OF CANCER CASES, IS EXACERBATED BY THE ACQUISITION OF RT RESISTANCE. THIS RT RESISTANCE IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR PATIENTS WITH LOCALLY ADVANCED THORACIC CANCERS, SUCH AS LUNG AND ESOPHAGEAL CANCERS. RT CAN LEAD TO AN IRON- DEPENDENT CELL DEATH MODALITY, CALLED FERROPTOSIS, BUT WHETHER FERROPTOSIS RESISTANCE OCCURS WITHIN TUMORS GIVING RISE TO ACQUIRED RT RESISTANCE IS NOT KNOWN AND IS THE CENTRAL THEME OF THE PROPOSED ACQUIRED RESISTANCE TO THERAPY AND IRON (ARTI) CENTER. THE OVERARCHING GOALS OF THE ARTI CENTER ARE: 1) TO BRIDGE THE BASIC SCIENCE MECHANISMS OF FERROPTOSIS IN ACQUIRED RESISTANCE WITH TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN PRECLINICAL MODELS AND HUMAN PATIENT SAMPLES; 2) TO IDENTIFY COHORTS OF PATIENTS WHO ARE AT GREATEST RISK TO DEVELOP ACQUIRED RT RESISTANCE; AND 3) TO INVESTIGATE THE ABILITY OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC AGENTS TO RE-SENSITIZE LUNG AND ESOPHAGEAL CANCER CELLS TO RADIATION BY INDUCING FERROPTOSIS. THE ARTI CENTER COMPRISES TWO BASIC/MECHANISTIC PROJECTS (PROJECT 1 AND PROJECT 2), ONE PRECLINICAL/TRANSLATIONAL PROJECT (PROJECT 3), AND ONE SHARED RESOURCE CORE (MOLECULAR IMAGING CORE [MIC]). PROJECT 1 WILL FOCUS ON ELUCIDATING WHETHER FERROPTOSIS EVASION IS A KEY DRIVER IN ACQUIRED RT RESISTANCE USING RADIORESISTANT LUNG CANCER AND ESOPHAGEAL CANCER CELL LINES AND XENOGRAFT MODELS THAT WILL BE USED IN PROJECT 2. PROJECT 2 WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT HYPOXIA, A LONG-RECOGNIZED DRIVER OF TUMOR RADIORESISTANCE, SUPPRESSES FERROPTOSIS INDUCTION DURING RT AND CONTRIBUTES TO RT-INDUCED ACQUIRED RESISTANCE TO FERROPTOSIS. FURTHERMORE, EXPRESSION OF HYPOXIA-RELATED GENES AND OTHER TARGETS OF ACQUIRED RT RESISTANCE WILL BE ANALYZED BY SINGLE-CELL SEQUENCING IN PROJECT 3. PROJECT 3 INVESTIGATES CHANGES IN IMMUNE CELLS IN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT OF HUMANIZED TUMOR MODELS DERIVED FROM CHEMORADIATION THERAPY-RESPONSIVE OR -NON- RESPONSIVE ESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA PATIENTS. THESE FERROPTOSIS-MEDIATED IMMUNOLOGIC CHANGES IN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT MAY SERVE AS PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS FOR IDENTIFYING TUMORS THAT MAY ACQUIRE RT RESISTANCE AND PREDICTING CANCER PATIENT OUTCOMES, WHICH COULD, IN THE FUTURE, BE MODULATED BY THE FERROPTOSIS- INDUCING AGENTS TESTED IN PROJECTS 1 AND 2. PROJECTS 1, 2, AND 3 WILL BE SUPPORTED BY THE MIC THAT UTILIZES BIOLUMINESCENCE IMAGING TO MONITOR TUMOR GROWTH, POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) TRACERS TO MONITOR CYSTINE TRANSPORTER ACTIVITY AND TO IDENTIFY HYPOXIC REGIONS WITHIN TUMORS, AS WELL AS NOVEL, REDOX-TUNED PET TRACERS FOR IDENTIFYING ACTIVATED INNATE IMMUNE CELLS.

PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN THEY ARE ADAPTED AND IMPLEMENTED IN REAL-WORLD SETTINGS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY AND PATIENT ADVOCACY STAKEHOLDERS. SETTING. OUR CENTER WILL BE HOUSED IN AN EXCEPTIONAL ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERS TRANSDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION, CATALYZES NEW IDEAS IN PATIENT ENGAGEMENT, AND ENSURES SUPPORT FOR PATIENT ENGAGEMENT AND GENOME SEQUENCING THAT FINDS SOLUTIONS FOR COMPLEX RECRUITMENT AND ENGAGEMENT CHALLENGES IN REAL-WORLD SETTINGS WITH UNDERREPRESENTED PATIENT POPULATIONS. SIGNIFICANT MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY WILL ALLOW US TO QUICKLY AND STRATEGICALLY INVEST IN IDEAS. AIMS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE CENTER ARE TO: (1) ADVANCE THE FIELD OF PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT TO STUDY CANCER DISPARITIES AND RARE CANCERS BY CONDUCTING INNOVATIVE AND IMPACTFUL DIRECT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WITH CONTINUOUS EVALUATION AND RESEARCH; (2) EXPAND AN EXCEPTIONAL, DIVERSE TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS, PATIENTS, AND ADVOCACY STAKEHOLDERS; (3) ADDRESS CANCER DISPARITIES BY UNDERSTANDING BARRIERS TO AND IMPROVING THE ABILITY FOR DISADVANTAGED AND UNDERSTUDIED POPULATIONS TO ENCOUNTER, USE, AND BENEFIT FROM GENOMIC SEQUENCING AND ANALYSIS; (4) ORGANIZE AND INTEGRATE CENTER UNITS TO FACILITATE TRANSDISCIPLINARY, TEAM SCIENCE WITHIN OUR CENTER AND ACROSS THE PE-CGS NETWORK. INNOVATIONS AND IMPACT. THE WU-PE-CGS BUILDS ON A LONG AND OUTSTANDING RECORD OF LEADERSHIP IN BOTH CANCER DISPARITIES AND GENOMIC RESEARCH ACROSS THE CANCER CONTINUUM. WE WILL BE PARTICULARLY INNOVATIVE AND ALLOW FOR A SIGNIFICANT RETURN ON THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTMENT IN SEVERAL WAYS. FIRST, OUR CENTER HAS DISTINCTIVE FEATURES THAT INCLUDE A COMBINED FOCUS ON CANCER DISPARITIES, THE APPLICATION OF STRATEGIES TO INCREASE PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT IN RESEARCH, SUCCESS IN BIOSPECIMEN ACQUISITION, AND EXCEPTIONAL GENOMIC SEQUENCING EXPERTISE. SECOND, WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A DIVERSE, WORLD CLASS TEAM WITH STRONG LINKAGES TO MULTIPLE RARE AND UNDERSTUDIED CANCERS. THIRD, WE ENGAGE INVESTIGATORS FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES AND INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY CAREER SCHOLARS. FOURTH, WE WILL STRATEGICALLY AND CREATIVELY DISSEMINATE PRODUCTS IN WAYS THAT WILL BENEFIT RESEARCHERS, PRACTITIONERS, AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. FIFTH, WE WILL PARTNER WITH EXCEPTIONAL PATIENT-CENTERED AND WIDE-REACHING ADVOCACY GROUPS TO ENGAGE PATIENTS, OPTIMIZE RECRUITMENT, AND SEAMLESSLY RETURN RESULTS. INPUT FROM THESE GROUPS, PATIENTS, AND THEIR FAMILIES IS A KEY STRENGTH THAT WILL LEVERAGE OUR TRACK RECORD OF STAKEHOLDER-ENGAGED RESEARCH. AND FINALLY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A FOCUSED STRATEGY FOR COLLECTIVE INTEGRATION OF OUR UNITS. THESE SYNERGIES WILL ALLOW OUR CENTER TO BECOME A NATIONAL RESOURCE FOR OPTIMAL APPROACHES TO PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT, OUTREACH, AND COMMUNICATION IN GENOMIC CHARACTERIZATION STUDIES AND OTHER STUDIES AS TECHNOLOGIES ADVANCE THAT WILL ACCELERATE PROGRESS FOR BOTH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, PATIENTS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES.  IN SUMMARY, WE ARE UNIQUELY SITUATED TO ADVANCE A NETWORK OF PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT AND SEQUENCING RESEARCHERS, INTEGRATE RESEARCH WITH PATIENTS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e0af38c9-92a8-f2cb-a5b8-4b4f14f99689-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U2CCA252981_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140657352, "Award ID": "U2CCA252979", "Award Amount": 6710888.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-21", "CFDA Number": "93.353", "Description": "OPTIMIZING ENGAGEMENT IN DISCOVERY OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION OF LOW GRADE GLIOMA (OPTIMUM) - PROJECT SUMMARY LOWER GRADE (WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) GRADE II/III) GLIOMA (LGG), A MALIGNANT TUMOR OF THE BRAIN, IS A UNIFORMLY FATAL DISEASE OF YOUNG ADULTS.

HISPANIC/LATINOS ARE THE LARGEST AND FASTING GROWING ETHNIC GROUP IN THE US, AND CANCER IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG H/L IN THE US. THEREFORE, WE NEED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE FULL COMPLEXITY OF THE MOLECULAR ETIOLOGY OF CANCER IN THIS ETHNIC GROUP. FOR INSTANCE, ALTHOUGH INCIDENCE RATES OF CRC ARE LOWER AMONG LATINOS AS COMPARED TO WHITES OR AFRICAN AMERICANS, HISPANICS WITH METASTATIC DISEASE HAVE SHORTER OVERALL SURVIVAL WHEN ADJUSTED FOR HEALTH CARE SETTING, DEMOGRAPHICS, DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS AND TREATMENT FACTORS. H/L ALSO TEND TO BE DIAGNOSED AT A YOUNGER AGE AND WITH HIGHER STAGE, AND WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT MEXICAN H/L IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THE GREATEST PROPORTION OF YOUNG (<50 YEARS OF AGE) DIAGNOSES COMPARED TO OTHER H/L SUBGROUPS. MOREOVER, MEXICAN H/L SHOWED HIGHER PREVALENCE OF RECTAL CANCER CASES COMPARED TO OTHER H/L AND NHW. ALTHOUGH SOCIO-ECONOMICS AND ACCESS TO CARE MIGHT INFLUENCE THESE DIFFERENCES, WE NEED TO TAKE A COMPLETE LOOK AT THE BIOLOGY OF DISEASE IN THIS ETHNIC GROUP TO DETERMINE ONCE AND FOR ALL IF THESE CLINICAL DIFFERENCES ARE RELATED TO DIFFERENCES IN MOLECULAR ETIOLOGY. THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS HAS PROVIDED A DEEP OVERVIEW OF THE MOLECULAR TAXONOMY OF CRC IN 594 CASES, HOWEVER, LESS THAN 1% OF THE CASES (N=5) WERE H/L. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR US TO TAKE MORE DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE MOLECULAR GENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF CRC IN H/L. ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES LIKELY LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM THESE LARGE GENOMIC INITIATIVES IN MINORITY PATIENTS IS THAT PATIENT OR PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT PRACTICES MAY NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES FOR ACCRUING AND CONSENTING PATIENTS INTO CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH STUDIES. THIS CONCEPT OF PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE PATIENTS AND THE TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH COMMUNITY. OPTIMIZING AND IMPROVING OUR APPROACHES FOR DIRECTLY ENGAGING PATIENTS AT INITIAL CONTACT, THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF A TRANSLATIONAL GENOMIC STUDY, AND DURING THE TIME OF RETURN OF RESULTS IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND PATIENTS, BUT COULD ALSO LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS AND FOR THE CANCER CARE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. AS SUCH, WE PROPOSE THE CREATION OF THE USC CENTER FOR OPTIMIZATION OF PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT IN CANCER CHARACTERIZATION (COPECC) WITH A FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING THE ENGAGEMENT OF LATINOS IN CRC GENOMIC CHARACTERIZATION RESEARCH STUDIES. USC COPECC WOULD SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE NCI U2C PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT AND CANCER GENOME SEQUENCING (PE-CGS) NETWORK. OUR INVESTIGATIVE TEAM INCLUDES EXPERTS IN ALL RELEVANT AREAS OF RESEARCH FOR GENOMIC CHARACTERIZATION, PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT, AND ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION. WE HAVE AN ESTABLISHED PLATFORM FOR CONSENTING PATIENTS INTO CANCER GENOMICS STUDIES THAT WILL SERVE AS A STANDARD PROCESS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF USC COPECC IS TO GENERATE RESULTS ON PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION AND CRC GENOMIC RESEARCH THAT WILL BE SHARED WITH THE BROADER COMMUNITY TO DISTRIBUTE BEST PRACTICES FOR

Number": "93.353", "Description": "PERSONALIZED NEUROBLASTOMA VACCINES - PROJECT SUMMARY THIS MULTIPLE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR (MPI) PROJECT PROPOSAL FOR THE PEDIATRIC IMMUNOTHERAPY NETWORK IS FOCUSED ON HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA, A DIVERSE AND ENIGMATIC MALIGNANCY ARISING FROM THE DEVELOPING SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT REMAINS LETHAL IN 50% OF PATIENTS DESPITE INTENSIVE MULTI-MODAL THERAPY. THERE IS AN URGENT UNMET NEED FOR DEVELOPING NOVEL THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS TO DECREASE THE INCIDENCE OF RELAPSE, INCREASE OVERALL SURVIVAL, AND REDUCE DEVASTATING TOXICITIES ASSOCIATED WITH STANDARD THERAPY. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ACHIEVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WITH HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PERSONALIZED VACCINATION STRATEGY TARGETING INDIVIDUALIZED NEOANTIGENS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMAS, DESPITE A LOW TUMOR MUTATION BURDEN (TMB), HARBOR A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF NEOEPITOPES THROUGH CANONICAL AND NON-CANONICAL MUTATIONS TO IDENTIFY, PREDICT, AND VALIDATE OPTIMAL NEOANTIGEN PEPTIDES TO ENGINEER EFFECTIVE MULTIVALENT PERSONALIZED NEUROBLASTOMA VACCINES. THE MOTIVATION FOR THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS THE URGENT NEED TO IMPROVE SURVIVAL AND TO DECREASE TREATMENT-RELATED MORBIDITIES FOR PATIENTS WITH HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA. INDEED, THE MAJORITY OF HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA PATIENTS ACHIEVE A REMISSION WITH STANDARD THERAPY, AND HERE WE SEEK TO ENGAGE THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO ERADICATE RESIDUAL DISEASE AND PREVENT RELAPSE. WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THROUGH THE TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DEFINE THE NEOANTIGEN LANDSCAPE OF HIGH- RISK NEUROBLASTOMA PATIENT AND GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MOUSE MODEL (GEMM) TUMORS; 2) DEVELOP AND TEST A READILY TRANSLATABLE PERSONALIZED VACCINATION STRATEGY. IN AIM 1 WE WILL BOTH PROVIDE THE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT THAT A MULTIVALENT VACCINE CONSISTING OF BOTH CD4+ AND CD8+ EPITOPES IS FEASIBLE FOR EACH HIGH-RISK PATIENT AND ALSO CREDENTIAL OUR GEMM SYSTEM FOR PRECLINICAL VACCINATION TRIALS IN AIM 2. WE WILL USE AN INTEGRATIVE PROTEOGENOMIC APPROACH TO IDENTIFY UP TO EIGHT IMMUNOGENIC PEPTIDES FOR EACH PERSONALIZED VACCINE. IN AIM 2, WE WILL TEST BOTH PREVENTATIVE AND THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF SELF-ASSEMBLING NANOPARTICLE MULTIVALENT PEPTIDE VACCINES USING OUR GEMM SYSTEM ON THE CB57BL/6 BACKGROUND, AND THEN COMPARE THIS VACCINE PLATFORM TO A NEW LIPID-PEPTIDE POLYMER VACCINE SYSTEM OPTIMIZED TO DELIVER PEPTIDES TO DENDRITIC CELLS. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES AN INNOVATIVE EXPERIMENTAL STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY, PRIORITIZE, AND VALIDATE NEOANTIGENS IN HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA, AND A CLINICALLY RELEVANT NEUROBLASTOMA GEMM SYSTEM FOR PRECLINICAL EVALUATION OF NEUROBLASTOMA VACCINES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS THE CREATION AND VALIDATION OF A NOVEL IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC APPROACH THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA STANDARD OF CARE BY PROVIDING DURABLE CURES AND DECREASED THERAPY- RELATED MORBIDITY. THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THIS COLLABORATIVE MPI PROJECT IS TO ESTABLISH THE PRECLINICAL PROOF-OF- CONCEPT FOR A PERSONALIZED NEUROBLASTOMA CLINICAL TRIAL THAT WE WOULD SEEK TO LAUNCH IN THE OUT YEARS OF THIS GRANT GIVEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE IN PLACE. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO ENABLE PERSONALIZED NEOANTIGEN-BASED VACCINE DEVELOPMENT FOR OTHER PEDIATRIC MALIGNANCIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b655b3eb-6e27-dfdd-c16c-ad7f8949f987-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01CA281881_7529"}, {"internal_id": 161262761, "Award ID": "U01CA281848", "Award Amount": 860018.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-07-21", "CFDA Number": "93.353", "Description": "BISPECIFIC ANTIBODY THERAPEUTICS FOR NEUROBLASTOMA AND DIFFUSE MIDLINE GLIOMA - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED BARRIERS HAVE UNDERMINED THE PROMISE OF IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH SOLID OR BRAIN TUMORS. MOST OF THESE TUMORS LACK GENETIC MUTATIONS THAT ENCODE IMMUNOGENIC PROTEINS. BISPECIFIC T CELL ENGAGERS (BTES) HAVE POTENTIAL TO OVERCOME THIS BARRIER BY CONNECTING CANCER CELLS TO ENDOGENOUS HOST T CELLS, BYPASSING T CELL RECEPTOR-MHC I INTERACTIONS TO INDUCE T CELL EXPANSION AND T CELL-MEDIATED CANCER CELL DEATH. ADDITIONAL BARRIERS IN SOLID TUMORS ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS APPLICATION. BARRIER #1 IS THE PAUCITY OF ENDOGENOUS T CELLS IN MANY PEDIATRIC SOLID AND BRAIN TUMORS. AIM 1 SEEKS TO ENHANCE T CELL TRAFFICKING INTO SOLID OR BRAIN TUMORS VIA TWO COMPLEMENTARY STRATEGIES THAT INVOLVE SELF-DISASSEMBLING POLYMERIC CHEMOKINES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AIM 1 IS THAT A SOLUTION FOR PROMOTING T CELL INFILTRATION INTO PEDIATRIC SOLID TUMORS WILL ENABLE BTE OPTIONS FOR NON-RESECTABLE OR METASTATIC SOLID AND BRAIN TUMORS, POTENTIALLY CONVERTING INCURABLE CANCERS TO CURABLE. BARRIER #2, UNIQUE TO BRAIN TUMOR PATIENTS, IS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER, WHICH PRECLUDES MANY IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS FROM ENTERING THE BRAIN. AIM 2 WAS MOTIVATED BY THE UNEXPECTED RESULT IN OUR LAB THAT A NOVEL BTE THAT WE ENGINEERED IS DRIVING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SURVIVAL IN A PATIENT-DERIVED MOUSE MODEL OF DIFFUSE MIDLINE GLIOMA (DMG, AKA DIPG) DESPITE A RELATIVELY INTACT BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER. WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS BTE IS ABLE TO ACCESS THE TUMOR AND EXTEND SURVIVAL. WE ALSO SEEK TO FURTHER OPTIMIZE THE BTE AND TEST IT IN A VARIETY OF DMG MODELS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AIM 2 IS THAT DMG PATIENTS HAVE AN AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF 12 MONTHS, AND THIS MOLECULE REPRESENTS AN IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC OPTION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE CELLULAR ENGINEERING. BARRIER #3 IMMUNOTHERAPY IS THAT THE CD3-BINDING COMPONENTS OF MOST BTES THAT HAVE ADVANCED TO CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT BIND TO CD3 ON T CELLS VIA HIGH-AFFINITY CD3 BINDING DOMAINS THAT 1) TRIGGER EXCESSIVE CYTOKINE RELEASE, WHICH CAUSES LIFE-THREATENING CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS) IN SOME PATIENTS, 2) ACCELERATES T CELL EXHAUSTION, AND 3) DRIVES BTE SEQUESTRATION IN LIVER AND SPLEEN. AIM 3 SEEKS TO DISCOVER NOVEL CD3 BINDING PROTEINS (E.G., FULLY HUMAN ANTIBODIES OR SINGLE CHAIN BINDERS) THAT CAN INDUCE CANCER CELL DEATH WITH FEWER LIABILITIES. SUCH CD3 BINDERS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY OTHERS BUT ARE LOCKED IN INDUSTRY WITH NO ACCESS PROVIDED TO PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCHERS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AIM 3 IS THAT OUR CANDIDATES COULD BE SUBSTITUTED INTO PEDIATRIC IMMUNOTHERAPY NETWORK BTES TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE RESULTING MOLECULES WILL BE SAFER, MORE EFFECTIVE (BECAUSE HIGHER MAXIMALLY TOLERATED DOSES MIGHT BE EXPECTED IF CRS RISK IS REDUCED), AND MORE EFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED.

PDAC TUMOR TISSUES HARBOR AN EXPANSIVE, DESMOPLASTIC STROMA THAT BOTH SUPPRESSES ANGIOGENESIS AND LIMITS PERFUSION AND DIFFUSION. CONSEQUENTLY, DELIVERY OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS THROUGH SYSTEMIC ADMINISTRATION IS IMPEDED, LOWERING DRUG EFFICACY AND INCREASING GENERAL TOXICITY. INDEED, MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF THE PDAC STROMA SUPPORT ITS SURVIVAL AND GROWTH, FOR EXAMPLE BY CONDITIONING A LOCALLY IMMUNOSUPPRESSED MICROENVIRONMENT THAT FACILITATES TUMOR SURVIVAL. CONVERSELY, WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT AT LEAST SOME ELEMENTS OF THE TUMOR STROMAL RESTRAIN PDAC GROWTH AND PROGRESSION, FOR EXAMPLE HEDGEHOG PATHWAY-RESPONSIVE MYOFIBROBLASTS. EARLY ATTEMPTS TO MODULATE THE PDAC STROMA IN ORDER TO FACILITATE DRUG DELIVERY FAILED UPON CLINICAL TRANSLATION. POST-CLINICAL TRIALS ULTIMATELY DEMONSTRATED THAT STROMAL REMODULATION UPON INHIBITION OF INDIVIDUAL PATHWAYS CAN LEAD TO UNPREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES IN MULTIPLE ADDITIONAL CELL TYPES.

PDAC IS CHARACTERIZED BY A DESMOPLASTIC STROMA THAT FACILITATES TUMOR GROWTH/INVASION, CHEMORESISTANCE OF PANCREATIC CANCER CELLS (PCC), AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE TME. HIGHLY PACKED CANCER-ASSOCIATED FIBROBLASTS (CAFS) AND DENSE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX (ECM) ARE HALLMARKS OF THE PDAC STROMA AND CONSTITUTE PHYSICAL DRUG DELIVERY BARRIERS. SEVERAL STROMAL COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN TARGETED TO ENHANCE DRUG DELIVERY, BUT RECENT STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED ANTI-TUMOR ROLES FOR THE STROMA AS COMPLETE ABLATION OF STROMAL COMPONENTS LEADS TO MORE AGGRESSIVE TUMORS. NEW STRATEGIES ARE HIGHLY DESIRED TO REPROGRAM STROMA WITHOUT COMPROMISING ITS ANTI-TUMOR ROLES. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE COAGULATION SYSTEM IN THE PDAC TME CAN BE TARGETED TO REPROGRAM PDAC STROMA TO OVERCOME CHEMORESISTANCE, DRUG DELIVERY BARRIERS, AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE TME. CANCER- ASSOCIATED COAGULATION HAS BEEN REPORTED AS A KEY FUNCTIONAL SIGNALING PATHWAY IN PDAC.

THE OUTCOME OF THIS RESEARCH WILL ESTABLISH A NEW MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF COAGULATION ACTIVITIES IN THE PDAC TME.

WE FOUND THAT THE BASAL SUBTYPE IS CONSISTENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH POOR OUTCOME AND HAVE SHOWN, THROUGH ANALYSIS OF TWO CLINICAL TRIALS, THAT PATIENTS WITH BASAL SUBTYPE TUMORS DO NOT RESPOND TO THE 1ST-LINE THERAPY FOLFIRINOX. THESE RESULTS STRONGLY SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT MOLECULAR SUBTYPES MAY BE USED TO SELECT TREATMENT. GIVEN THE IMPACT OF OUR TUMOR-INTRINSIC SUBTYPES ON THERAPY RESPONSE, WE DEVELOPED A SINGLE SAMPLE CLASSIFIER, PURIST, THAT IS NOW A CLIA CERTIFIED ASSAY AND BEING EVALUATED AS AN INTEGRAL MARKER FOR TREATMENT SELECTION IN A CLINICAL TRIAL.

USING THE DECONVOLUTION APPROACHES THAT LED US TO IDENTIFY TUMOR-INTRINSIC SUBTYPES, WE HAVE FOUND TWO TYPES OF PDAC STROMA: ACTIVATED, AND NORMAL WHERE PATIENTS WITH ACTIVATED STROMA HAVE SHORTER SURVIVAL. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT CAFS ARE THE CONTRIBUTORY CELLS IN ACTIVATED STROMA.

IT IS LIKELY THAT TUMOR-PROMOTING AND TUMOR-SUPPRESSIVE EFFECTS OF CAF AND ECM OCCUR IN PARALLEL AND THAT THEIR BALANCE DETERMINES THE NET EFFECT ON PDAC GROWTH.

TREATMENT FOR HORMONAL RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER - ABSTRACT PROSTATE CANCER, RATHER INDOLENT BY NATURE, HAS SPECIFIC SUBTYPES PRESENT WITH AGGRESSIVE LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE THAT ARE QUICKLY BECOMING HORMONAL RESISTANT. PATIENTS WITH CASTRATE-RESISTANT DISEASE (CRPC) ARE GENERALLY YOUNGER AND NON-CAUCASIAN, AND MANY SUFFER FROM LOCAL PROGRESSION, EDEMA, AND PAIN. RADIOTHERAPY (RT) IS OFFERED BUT LIMITED BY THE EXTENT, FORMER EXPOSURE, AND RESISTANCE OF DISEASE. SEQUENTIAL MULTIPLE CHEMOTHERAPY OR RT TREATMENTS, OFFERED AS STANDARD OF CARE, ARE HARD TO COMPLY TO, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-RESOURCE POPULATIONS. TREATMENT OF THIS SYMPTOMATIC POPULATION IS OFTEN TERMINATED PREMATURELY, OR NEVER STARTED, DUE TO FINANCIAL AND TIME RESTRICTIONS. INNOVATIVE, SHORTER MORE EFFICIENT TREATMENTS ARE NEEDED, ESPECIALLY TO REDUCE DISPARITIES IN COMPLIANCE AND OUTCOMES OF GLOBAL CANCER CARE. IN EXTENSIVE PRECLINICAL WORK, THE COMBINATION OF RT WITH IMMUNOGENIC SMART RADIOTHERAPY MATERIALS (ISRBS), ADDRESSED AS RADIO-IMMUNOTHERAPY DOSE-PAINTING (RAID) TECHNOLOGY, BRINGS INTRA-TUMORAL SLOW-RELEASE ANTICD40 PAYLOAD IN THE TARGET THAT GETS IRRADIATED AND HAS SHOWN TO PRIME THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND CREATE SUSTAINABLE TUMOR CONTROL BY IN SITU-VACCINATION, EVEN AFTER DIFFERENT THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS HAVE FAILED. MOREOVER, THIS COMBINATION TREATMENT CAN IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) FAST BY A SHORT SIMPLE INTERVENTION WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS, HAVING AN ANTICD40 PAYLOAD FAR SMALLER THAN NEEDED IN INTRAVENOUS (IV) IMMUNOTHERAPY. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT - PROPOSED BY NANOCAN THERAPEUTICS CORPORATION IN COLLABORATION WITH JOHN HOPKINS MEDICINE, DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE AND NORTHWELL HEALTH - IS TO BRIDGE PRECLINICAL WORK TO THE FIRST CLINICAL TRIAL WITH THE INNOVATIVE RAID TECHNOLOGY AND CONFIRM ITS POTENTIAL FOR IN SITU-VACCINATION THAT CAN EXTEND THE USE OF RADIOTHERAPY (RT) FROM PALLIATIVE LOCAL TREATMENT TO SYSTEMIC DISEASE CONTROL IN ONE SESSION. THE ISRBS ARE AS SEED-LIKE FIDUCIAL MARKERS ADMINISTERED DIRECTLY IN THE PROSTATE TUMOR BY ULTRASOUND GUIDED NEEDLES. THE ISRBS CREATE CONTRAST ON CT AND KV IMAGING MAKING RT SET-UP FAST; ISRBS SLOWLY RELEASE (20MCG PER UNIT OVER 15 DAYS) ANTI-CD40 PAYLOAD DIRECTLY THE TARGET WHICH GETS IRRADIATED, TRIGGERING IN SITU-VACCINATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TRANSLATE EXTENSIVE SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA FROM SMALL ANIMAL STUDIES OF SINGLE FRACTION RT COMBINED WITH SLOW RELEASED INTRA-TUMORAL ANTICD40 DELIVERY TO A FIRST HUMAN TRIAL FOR CRPC PATIENTS. THE FIRST PART WILL BE USED TO OPTIMIZE ISRBS INTO A CGMP PRODUCT, AND CONFIRMATION OF LARGER VOLUME TESTING IN MONKEYS TO CONFIRM SAFETY, IMMUNOGENICITY, AND PHARMACOKINETICS ALREADY PERFORMED IN EXTENSIVE SMALL ANIMAL WORK. MILESTONES WILL COMPLETE IND FILLING BY NANOCAN THERAPEUTICS. AFTER FDA APPROVAL, SECOND PART OF THE PROJECT WILL ENCOMPASS THE PHASE 1 SINGLE ARM OPEN LABEL CLINICAL TRIAL SEEKING CONFIRMATION OF SAFETY AND NUMBER OF ISRBS AS WELL AS RT DOSE NEEDED IN CRPR PATIENTS.

CURRENT VACCINES ARE ALSO COSTLY AND CHALLENGING TO DISTRIBUTE TO LMIC DUE TO THEIR THERMAL STABILITY AND 3-DOSE REGIMEN. THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT VACCINES AND BURDEN OF HPV ON LMIC UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR NEW CHEAPER HPV VACCINES THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY DEPLOYED IN LMIC. VAXSYNA, INC ADDRESSES THIS NEED WITH AN HPV VACCINE CANDIDATE THAT IS LOW-COST, BROADLY PROTECTIVE, AND EFFICACIOUS WITH A TARGETED TWO-DOSE SCHEDULE. OUR VACCINE CANDIDATE DISPLAYS THE HIGHLY CONSERVED HPV L2 ANTIGEN ON OUR PATENTED PLATFORM THAT USES VIRUS LIKE PARTICLES (VLP) AND RECOMBINANT IMMUNE COMPLEXES (RIC). THE HPV L2 ANTIGEN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PROTECT AGAINST UP TO 22 TYPES OF HPV IN MICE AND RABBITS AND HAS BEEN EVALUATED IN HUMAN PHASE I TRIALS. OUR VACCINE IS PRODUCED USING AN OPTIMIZED PLANT EXPRESSION SYSTEM THAT LOWERS THE MANUFACTURING COST (ESTIMATED AT LESS THAN $0.5/DOSE VS. $160/DOSE FOR GARDASIL-9), THEREBY PRODUCING HIGH LEVELS OF PROTEINS IN 4-5 DAYS WITHOUT HUMAN OR ANIMAL PATHOGEN CONTAMINATION. PRECLINICAL, MOUSE VACCINATION STUDIES WITH OUR CANDIDATE HAVE CONFIRMED ITS EFFICACY IN GENERATING HIGH ANTIBODY TITERS AND VIRAL NEUTRALIZATION IN AS LITTLE AS TWO DOSES. FURTHER TESTS OF OUR VACCINE PLATFORM HAVE SHOWN THAT PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE NEED OF A CHEMICAL ADJUVANT. THE GOAL OF THIS STTR PHASE I PROJECT IS TO CONDUCT PROOF-OF-CONCEPT STUDIES TO CHARACTERIZE THE FORMULATION OF VAXSYNA\u2019S HPV CANCER VACCINE AS A BROAD-SPECTRUM HPV VACCINE THAT TARGETS ALL CLINICALLY RELEVANT HPVS. TEMPERATURE STABILITY IS AN IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC FOR VACCINES THAT ARE TARGETED FOR LMIC. AS SUCH, OUR AIM 1 WILL ASSESS THE THERMAL STABILITY OF BOTH OUR VLP AND RIC VACCINE COMPONENTS. IF ONE PLATFORM IS MORE STABLE THAN THE OTHER, WE WILL ADJUST OUR VACCINE FORMULATION ACCORDINGLY IN AIM 2. AIM 2 WILL COMPARE THE ANTIBODY AND NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY TITERS PRODUCED AFTER MOUSE VACCINATION WITH VARYING RATIOS OF VLP TO RIC AS COMPARED TO GARDASIL-9. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS CRITICAL TO INITIATE OUR PROPOSED PHASE II STUDIES INVOLVING PRE-IND GMP MANUFACTURING STRATEGIES AND TESTING WITHIN THE SAME ANIMAL MODELS USED TO VALIDATE CURRENT VACCINES. UPON SUCCESSFUL APPROVAL OF VAXSYNA\u2019S HPV VACCINE, OUR ADVANTAGES OF LOW COSTS AND BROAD-SPECTRUM PROTECTION WILL POSITION VAXSYNA TO PREVENT HPV-CAUSED CANCERS FOR INDIVIDUALS IN LMIC.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3fb0ac69-8f41-f3c2-f39d-abb102592424-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R41CA271851_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140057864, "Award ID": "R41CA261451", "Award Amount": 355723.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-08", "CFDA Number": "93.353", "Description": "ANALYZING THE EFFICACY OF MMP-13 INHIBITORS IN THE TREATMENT OF CIPN - PROJECT SUMMARY THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE DRUG CANDIDATE TO TREAT CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (CIPN).

A MAJOR BARRIER TO IMPLEMENTATION BY PROVIDERS, AND ACCEPTANCE BY PATIENTS, RELATES TO UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE BIOLOGY OF GRADE GROUP 1 (GG1; GLEASON 6) PROSTATE CANCER.

SPATIOTEMPORAL TUMOR ATLASES INTEGRATE MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND STRUCTURAL INFORMATION, AS WELL AS CLINICAL DATA. INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTING 2D AND 3D MAPS WILL LEAD TO NEW INSIGHTS INTO MOLECULAR PROCESSES THAT DRIVE TUMORIGENESIS AND EVENTUALLY GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CANCER TREATMENT STRATEGIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIALIZED VISUAL EXPLORATION TOOLS TO SUPPORT THIS DISCOVERY PROCESS IS CRITICAL. HOWEVER, THESE TOOLS MUST BE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS SEVERAL CHALLENGES: A LARGE NUMBER OF FEATURES SUCH AS CELLS OR MOLECULES THAT NEED TO BE VISUALIZED, THE NEED TO LINK ACROSS DIVERSE MODALITIES SUCH AS GENOMIC AND IMAGING DATA, THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE TIMEPOINTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL SCALES, AS WELL AS THE VOLUME OF DATA GENERATED BY MANY ASSAYS. FURTHERMORE, THE CANCER RESEARCH COMMUNITY INCLUDES A BROAD SPECTRUM OF USER AUDIENCES WITH VARYING DATA VISUALIZATION NEEDS. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR INTEGRATIVE, WEB-BASED VISUALIZATION OF HUMAN TUMOR ATLASES. OUR WORK WILL BE GUIDED BY USER-CENTERED DESIGN PROCESSES AND WE WILL BE COLLABORATING WITH USERS IN THE CANCER RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO ELICIT USER NEEDS AND TO EVALUATE OUR VISUALIZATION TOOLS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT VISUALIZATION TOOLS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE TARGETED USER AUDIENCES. GIVEN THE DIVERSITY AND SIZE OF THE DATASETS GENERATED BY ASSAYS USED TO BUILD TUMOR ATLASES, WE WILL DESIGN THIS FRAMEWORK TO BE EXTENSIBLE AND SCALABLE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE ARE PROPOSING THREE DISTINCT AIMS FOR THIS PROJECT. ONE AIM IS TO DEVELOP A MODULAR, WEB-BASED TOOLKIT FOR VISUAL ANALYSIS OF MULTIMODAL SPATIAL SINGLE-CELL CANCER DATASETS. THIS TOOLKIT WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE THROUGH R AND PYTHON APIS FOR INTEGRATION INTO COMPUTATIONAL NOTEBOOKS. THIS WILL ENABLE DATA ANALYSTS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO CONNECT ANY VISUALIZATIONS CREATED WITH THE TOOLKIT TO STATE OF THE ART COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES, WHICH COMPLEMENT THE VISUAL EXPLORATION SUPPORTED BY THE VISUALIZATIONS. ANOTHER AIM OF OUR WORK IS THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NOVEL METHODS FOR COMPARATIVE AND LONGITUDINAL VISUALIZATION OF SPATIOTEMPORAL TUMOR ATLAS DATA SETS. FINALLY, WE WILL ALSO BUILD A WEB-BASED PLATFORM THAT WILL ALLOW ANY CANCER RESEARCHER TO CREATE THEIR OWN INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATIONS OF MULTIMODAL SPATIOTEMPORAL TUMOR ATLAS DATASETS THROUGH A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE.

LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES, AND LUNG CANCER SCREENING HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE LUNG CANCER BY 20-26% IN ELIGIBLE PATIENTS. DESPITE 10 YEARS OF RECOMMENDATIONS ENDORSING SCREENING, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT REAL-WORLD IMPLEMENTATION OF SCREENING ALONG THE CARE CONTINUUM HAS BEEN POOR. SPECIFICALLY, PRIOR WORK REVEALS THAT ADHERENCE TO ROUTINE ANNUAL SCREENING AND SPECIALIZED FOLLOW-UP AFTER POSITIVE LUNG CANCER SCREENING EXAMS IS SUBOPTIMAL, WITH A MEDIAN ADHERENCE OF 40-60% ACROSS CLINICAL PROGRAMS. FOLLOW-UP AFTER EITHER NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE LUNG CANCER SCREENING IS A CRITICAL TARGET TO ACHIEVE MORTALITY BENEFITS SEEN IN CLINICAL TRIALS, AS ADHERENCE TO FOLLOW-UP WAS >90% IN THESE STUDIES, AND MORE THAN HALF OF ALL SCREEN-DETECTED LUNG CANCERS WERE DIAGNOSED IN FOLLOW-UP.  PRIOR STUDIES OF ADHERENCE TO FOLLOW-UP BEEN LARGELY OBSERVATIONAL, SINGLE CENTER AND PERFORMED IN ACADEMIC SETTINGS, BUT HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT CLINICAL LUNG CANCER SCREENING PROGRAMS WHICH CONTAIN CENTRALIZED PROGRAM-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS CARE COORDINATION HAVE TWO-TO-THREE TIMES THE RATE OF FOLLOW-UP ADHERENCE COMPARED TO PROGRAMS WHERE LUNG CANCER SCREENING IS LARGELY MANAGED BY PRIMARY PROVIDERS. PRIOR OBSERVATIONAL WORK ALSO SUGGESTS CENTRALIZED PROGRAMMATIC INTERVENTIONS MAY MITIGATE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN LUNG CANCER SCREENING. IT IS THEREFORE CRITICAL TO PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATE FEASIBLE AND EFFECTIVE CENTRALIZED PROGRAM INTERVENTIONS IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS TO TRANSLATE THE BENEFITS TO SCREENING PROGRAMS AND PATIENTS.  TO FILL THIS IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE GAP, THE CENTRAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO GENERATE EVIDENCE OF BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO LUNG CANCER SCREENING FOLLOW-UP IN DECENTRALIZED COMMUNITY PROGRAMS, ADAPT AND INTRODUCE CENTRALIZING INTERVENTIONS IN THESE SETTINGS AND RIGOROUSLY MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INTERVENTIONS. THIS OBJECTIVE WILL BE MET BY ACHIEVEMENT OF THREE SPECIFIC AIMS PERFORMED AT 3 NON- ACADEMIC REGIONAL PARTNERING SITES WITH LARGE RURAL AND HISPANIC POPULATIONS. IN THE FIRST AIM, WE WILL DETERMINE SYSTEM-, PROVIDER- AND PATIENT-LEVEL FACILITATORS TO LCS FOLLOW-UP IN THESE SETTINGS USING AN INNOVATIVE RAPID ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACH SUPPLEMENTED BY SEMI-STRUCTURE INTERVIEWS. IN THE SECOND AIM, WE WILL ADAPT AND EVALUATE CENTRALIZING INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING DEFINED CARE PATHWAYS AND AFTER-SCREENING CARE COORDINATION MEASURING THE IMPACT ON ADHERENCE AND SOCIOECONOMIC, RURAL-URBAN AND RACIAL-ETHNIC DISPARITIES. FINALLY IN THE THIRD AIM, WE WILL EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STRATEGIES WITH A KEY FOCUS ON THE TENSION BETWEEN FIDELITY AND ADAPTATIONS AS THESE INTERVENTIONS MATURE. THE AIMS WILL BE GROUNDED IN AN INTEGRATION OF THE CONSOLIDATIVE FRAMEWORK OF IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH, RE-AIM AND A NIH-DEVELOPED HEALTH DISPARITIES FRAMEWORK. OUR TEAM HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN LUNG CANCER SCREENING IMPLEMENTATION AND DISPARITIES WITH EXPERTISE IN ADAPTING AND EVALUATING PRAGMATIC INTERVENTIONS IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS.

HCC IS THE FOURTH CAUSE OF CANCER-RELATED DEATHS IN THE WORLD AND IS SEEN AT HIGHER RATES AMONG HISPANICS, BLACKS, AND ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS COMPARED WITH NON- HISPANIC WHITES. IN THE U.S, THE RATE OF DEATH FROM LIVER CANCER HAS INCREASED >40%. THE PROTO-ONCOGENE MYC IS DEREGULATED IN ~80% OF HCC. YET, MYC REMAINS TO BE AN UNDRUGGABLE TARGET.

THE CD40 RECEPTOR IS IMPORTANT IN BOTH INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES AND A GREATER THERAPEUTIC EFFECT CAN BE ACHIEVED COMBINING ACD40 WITH RT IN ANIMAL MODELS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SHORT COURSE RT (SCRT) AND CT WHEN COMBINED WITH ACD40 IN HUMAN TUMORS CAN RESULT IN A GREATER ANTITUMOR IM- MUNE RESPONSE, REDUCE RISK OF METASTATIC PROGRESSION, AND EXTEND SURVIVAL IN A POORLY IMMUNOGENIC MALIG- NANCY LIKE RECTAL CANCER. WE DEVELOPED THE INNATE TRIAL, A PHASE II RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF NEOADJUVANT SCRT FOL- LOWED BY CT WITH OR WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF SOTIGALIMAB FOR LOCALLY ADVANCED RECTAL CANCER. THIS TRIAL DESIGN HAS ALLOWED US TO COLLECT FRESH PRE- AND POST-SCRT BIOPSY TISSUE, WHICH WE HAVE OBTAINED FROM 21 OF 30 PATIENTS ENROLLED TO DATE. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE FOCUS ON THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT AN INTEGRATED MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND SPATIAL ASSESSMENT OF TREATMENT RESPONSE DYNAMICS IN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT EARLY AFTER SCRT CAN RE- VEAL INSIGHTS INTO THE IMMUNOBIOLOGICAL RESPONSES, WHICH CAN INFORM MECHANISMS OF EFFICACY AND THERAPEUTIC SELECTION. WE WILL PERFORM 1) MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR SINGLE CELL (SC) RNASEQ WITH PROTEOMIC AND IMMUNE REPER- TOIRE ANALYSIS, 2) MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND SPATIAL MULTIPLEX IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE, AND 3) CELLULAR AND SPATIAL QUANTITATIVE DEEP LEARNING BASED HISTOPATHOLOGIC ANALYSIS TO ACHIEVE OUR AIMS. THESE THREE TECHNOLOGIES WILL ENABLE US TO INVESTIGATE EARLY CHANGES ACROSS RT AND ACD40 TREATED GROUPS. THEN WE WILL AIM TO IDENTIFY THER- APEUTIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMBINATION OF SCRT WITH IMMUNE ACTIVE AGENTS THOUGH AN INTEGRATED RT RE- SPONSE ASSESSMENT. LASTLY, WE WILL ESTABLISH INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNOLOGIC SIGNALING EVENTS TRIGGERED BY SCRT IN COMBINATION WITH ACD40 IMMUNOTHERAPY AND FACTORS THAT ENHANCE OR HINDER EFFICACY. WE WILL USE MODELS TO START VALIDATING KEY FINDINGS AND AIM TO PROPOSE FUTURE THERAPEUTIC DIRECTIONS TO BUILD OFF THESE EFFORTS AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVE OUTCOMES.

TREATMENTS LIKE IMMUNOTHERAPY HAVE RADICALLY CHANGED ALC CARE, YIELDING LESS TOXICITY AND UNPRECEDENTED INCREASES IN 5-YEAR SURVIVAL. HOWEVER, MENTAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE CONCERNS PERSIST, WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED TO FULLY REALIZE THE SURVIVAL BENEFITS OF THESE MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS IN THIS NEW TREATMENT CONTEXT, PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PALLIATIVE CARE FOR ALC MUST SHIFT FROM A PREDOMINANT END-OF-LIFE FRAMEWORK TO ONE OF SURVIVORSHIP. A HOPE-BASED INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT PATIENTS\u2019 GOAL PURSUITS IN THEIR FAMILY, SOCIAL, WORK, AND LEISURE LIVES IS A PROMISING APPROACH TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THIS CURRENT CONTEXT. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO IMPROVE ALC PATIENT MENTAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE DURING CANCER TREATMENT. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE IN THIS APPLICATION IS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A NOVEL PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTION CALLED \u201cPATHWAYS\u201d TO SUPPORT PERSONAL GOAL PURSUIT DURING ALC TREATMENT. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT PATHWAYS WILL REDUCE GOAL DISRUPTION AND THEREBY IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE DURING ALC TREATMENT. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROJECT IS THAT PATHWAYS, A BRIEF, HOPE-BASED INTERVENTION DELIVERED PRIMARILY AT THE POINT OF ALC PATIENT CARE BY A RANGE OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS (E.G., NURSE, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST, SOCIAL WORKER) HAS DEMONSTRATED FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY TO ALC PATIENTS, WITH ENCOURAGING PRELIMINARY EFFECTS ON GOAL DISRUPTION, MENTAL HEALTH, AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED THROUGH TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) TEST THE EFFICACY OF PATHWAYS AGAINST ENHANCED USUAL CARE; AND 2) EVALUATE GOAL INTERFERENCE AND GOAL ADJUSTMENT AS MEDIATORS OF INTERVENTION EFFECTS.

WE SOUGHT TO RE-ESTABLISH AN ANTI-TUMOR IMMUNE RESPONSE BY TARGETING SURFACE RECEPTORS ON TAMS THAT HELP DRIVE PCA PROGRESSION. USING HUMAN PCA TUMOR MICROARRAYS, WE PUBLISHED THAT THE MACROPHAGE MANNOSE RECEPTOR (CD206) INCREASED DURING PCA PROGRESSION TO MCRPC.

LUNG CANCER IS THE LEADING CANCER-RELATED CAUSE OF DEATH AND THE THIRD MOST DIAGNOSED CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES. NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CARCINOMAS (NSCLC), REPRESENT 90% OF LUNG CANCERS, AND SURGICAL RESECTION CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO CURE PATIENTS WITH LOW STAGE PREMETASTATIC DISEASE. SURGEONS TYPICALLY USE VISUAL INSPECTION AND FINGER PALPATION TO DEFINE SOLID TUMOR MARGINS. HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH IS OFTEN INSUFFICIENT TO DETECT RESIDUAL DISEASE, LEADING TO RECURRENCE IN UP TO 40% OF PATIENTS AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED 5-YEAR SURVIVAL. IMPROVING INTRAOPERATIVE DETECTION OF TUMOR MARGINS IS IMPERATIVE, BECAUSE SMALL FOCI OF RESIDUAL DISEASE AT OR CLOSE TO THE RESECTION MARGINS ARE THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF LOCAL RECURRENCE.

CAN EXACERBATE THE \u201cDIGITAL DIVIDE,\u201d INCREASING DISPARITIES IN CARE AND HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO FOCUS ON HEALTH EQUITY. SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND STRUCTURAL FACTORS COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDH) \u2013 ACCOUNT FOR 30-50% OF THE VARIANCE IN HEALTH OUTCOMES, FAR MORE THAN THE 10-20% ASCRIBED TO HEALTH CARE. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HEALTH EQUITY, IT IS CRUCIAL TO TARGET THESE SDH. WE WILL PARTICULARLY FOCUS ON RACE/ETHNICITY, POVERTY AND RURALITY AND HOW THEY AFFECT USE OF TELEHEALTH, WHICH WE REFER TO AS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF TELEHEALTH (SDTH). THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VA) IS THE LARGEST INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE US, PROVIDING CARE TO 9 MILLION PATIENTS ACROSS 171 MEDICAL CENTERS AND 1,112 OUTPATIENT SITES. VA PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE HOW SDTH AFFECT USE OF TELEHEALTH FOR CANCER ACROSS A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WITH EQUAL ACCESS AND WITHOUT FOCUS ON REIMBURSEMENT. THEREFORE, THE ENTIRE VA SYSTEM WILL SERVE AS OUR CLINICAL PRACTICE NETWORK FOR THIS CENTER. ALL THREE THRIVE PI\u2019S ARE EXPERTS IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE AND WILL USE THE NIMHD HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH FRAMEWORK AND THE CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH TO GUIDE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF TELEHEALTH CARE DELIVERY FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND TO EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND DISPARITIES. WE PROPOSE A CENTER CALLED TELEHEALTH RESEARCH AND INNOVATION FOR VETERANS WITH CANCER (THRIVE), WHOSE OVERARCHING AIM IS TWO-FOLD: 1) TO UNDERSTAND HOW SDTH IMPACT THE DELIVERY OF TELEHEALTH FOR CANCER AND 2) TO DEVELOP METHODS TO ADDRESS SDTH AND THEREBY IMPROVE ACCESS AND QUALITY OF CANCER CARE FOR ALL PATIENTS. THRIVE WILL FOCUS ON FOUR HIGHLY IMPORTANT AND PREVALENT CANCERS WITHIN VA: LUNG, COLON, PROSTATE, AND BREAST. OUR FINDINGS WILL BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE IN UNDERSTANDING HOW TELEHEALTH IMPLEMENTATION AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF CANCER CARE FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION AND HOW VA AND OTHER US HEALTH SYSTEMS CAN LEVERAGE TELEHEALTH TO IMPROVE CANCER OUTCOMES AND HEALTH EQUITY.

PRIOR WORK DEMONSTRATES THAT ONCOLOGY-FOCUSED TELEHEALTH CAN ACHIEVE FAVORABLE OUTCOMES, BUT LARGE-SCALE TRIALS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO SPECIFIC CONTEXTS LIKE PALLIATIVE CARE OR SURVIVORSHIP. ADOPTION HAS BEEN CONSTRAINED BY RESTRICTED REIMBURSEMENT. THE MATCHES CENTER WILL HELP REMEDIATE THIS EVIDENCE GAP BY EXECUTING PROSPECTIVE TRIALS, CONDUCTING OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSES, AND TRAINING TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCHERS. OUR RESEARCH THEME FOCUSES ON THE INTEGRATION OF MULTI-LAYERED DATA FROM TELEHEALTH PLATFORMS, PATIENT PORTALS, MOBILE TRACKING DEVICES, AND THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD TO DEVELOP ANALYTIC METHODS THAT SUPPORT PERSONALIZED CARE. WE AIM TO DEVELOP A NEW PARADIGM IN ONCOLOGY\u2014PRECISION DELIVERY\u2014WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF MATCHING INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WITH THE MOST BENEFICIAL COMBINATION OF CLINIC-BASED OR TELEHEALTH-SUPPORTED HOME-SETTING CARE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME\u2014ALL BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF DYNAMICALLY AVAILABLE DATA. WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL BY APPLYING DATA SCIENCE METHODS\u2014INCLUDING NIMBLE TRIAL DESIGNS AND MACHINE LEARNING\u2014THAT HAVE HAD LIMITED APPLICATION TO TELEHEALTH TO DATE. BY ESTABLISHING A RESEARCH HUB THAT NURTURES INVESTIGATORS ACROSS DISCIPLINES AND PROVIDES TRAINING, TOOLS, DATA, ANALYTIC METHODS, AND VENUES FOR SHARING KNOWLEDGE AND BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS, WE EXPECT TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS IN THE SCIENCE OF CARE DELIVERY. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE 1) TO CONDUCT IMPACTFUL PRAGMATIC TRIALS OF TELEHEALTH IN ONCOLOGY, 2) TO ANALYZE A LARGE EXISTING CACHE OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL OBSERVATIONAL DATA CHARACTERIZING TELEHEALTH UTILIZATION AND OUTCOMES, 3) TO TRAIN INVESTIGATORS AND EQUIP THEM WITH THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO INNOVATE WITHIN AN EVIDENCE-BASED FRAMEWORK, AND 4) TO INTEGRATE TELEHEALTH WITH OTHER DATA STREAMS AND CREATE AND APPLY ANALYTIC METHODS TO TRANSFORM THE FIELD OF PRECISION CARE DELIVERY. AN ADMINISTRATIVE CORE WILL COORDINATE ACTIVITIES AND ENGAGE FEEDBACK FROM INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS\u2014INCLUDING PATIENTS AND THE ONCOLOGY WORKFORCE. OUR CLINICAL PRACTICE NETWORK SERVES AS AN INNOVATION LABORATORY AND COMPRISES 7 OUTPATIENT CLINICS IN NY AND NJ WITH A SHARED INFORMATICS ECOSYSTEM INCLUDING TELEHEALTH CAPACITY, DIGITAL MONITORING, AND A HIGHLY TRAFFICKED PATIENT PORTAL. THIS WILL ENABLE US TO LAUNCH AND EXECUTE A LARGE PRAGMATIC TRIAL COMPARING IN-PERSON CARE TO TELEHEALTH, WITH RESOURCES DESIGNED TO SUPPORT HOME-BASED CARE USING A CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED DESIGN.

CANCER RISK BEHAVIORS (E.G., SMOKING, PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, OBESITY1) ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POOR TREATMENT RESPONSE, TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS, HEIGHTENED RECURRENCE RISK, DECREASED LONGEVITY, DIMINISHED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND INCREASED TREATMENT COST FOR MANY CANCERS2-8. THESE RISK BEHAVIORS ARE AT LEAST AS PREVALENT IN CANCER PATIENTS AS THEY ARE IN HEALTHY ADULTS, BUT REFERRAL PATHWAYS TO TREAT THEM ARE NOT ROUTINELY INTEGRATED INTO CANCER CARE. BY INTEGRATING CANCER RISK BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT INTO THE EHR AND AUTOMATING REFERRAL, WE PLAN TO MAKE TELEHEALTH-ENABLED TREATMENT OF HEALTH RISK BEHAVIORS (A CLINICAL SERVICE CALLED HEALTH PROMOTION) ACCESSIBLE TO CANCER PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS THROUGHOUT NORTHWESTERN\u2019S CLINICAL PRACTICE NETWORK IN A MANNER THAT IS AFFORDABLE, IMPROVES CARE QUALITY, AND IS MINIMALLY DISRUPTIVE TO CLINICAL WORKFLOW.

PHYSICAL INACTIVITY9, OBESITY10, SMOKING11 OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT TELEHEALTH, AS COMPARED TO IN-PERSON CANCER CARE, MAY MAKE TREATMENT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO OLDER ADULTS AND MINORITIES. WITH CANCER MOONSHOT AND OTHER FUNDS, WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY DEVELOPED PATIENT-REPORTED ASSESSMENT, SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, AND SHARED DECISION-MAKING TOOLS THAT ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE SINGLE EHR (EPIC) SYSTEM THAT LINKS THE NORTHWESTERN MEMORIAL HEALTHCARE CORPORATION\u2019S (NMHC)11-HOSPITAL HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM.
