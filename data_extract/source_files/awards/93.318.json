INFLUENZA CIRCULATES YEAR-ROUND IN KENYA AND HAS BEEN DETECTED IN HUMANS, POULTRY, AND SWINE. ALTHOUGH HIGHLY PATHOGENIC AVIAN INFLUENZA (HPAI) HAS NOT BEEN DETECTED, KENYA IS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE BECAUSE OF ITS POSITION ALONG MIGRATORY BIRD ROUTES AND PROXIMITY TO OTHER HIGH-RISK COUNTRIES. IN 2007, THE KENYA MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH), WITH TECHNICAL SUPPORT FROM CDC AND THE KENYA MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE (KEMRI), ESTABLISHED A NATIONAL INFLUENZA SENTINEL SURVEILLANCE (ISS) SYSTEM. THE ISS HAS ENABLED KENYA TO DOCUMENT THE BURDEN OF INFLUENZA-ASSOCIATED ILLNESS, CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL BURDEN ESTIMATES, INFLUENCE POLICY, MONITOR CHANGES IN CIRCULATING VIRUSES, AND CONTRIBUTE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND VIROLOGIC DATA TO WHO GISRS AND SPECIMENS TO THE WHO COLLABORATING CENTER AT CDC. EVEN WITH THE ABOVE SUCCESS, DATA AND SPECIMEN SHARING HAVE HAD CHALLENGES DUE TO LAG IN TESTING/SHIPPING, OTHER COMPETING NATIONAL TESTING PRIORITIES, AND TESTING SUPPLY STOCK-OUTS. IN ADDITION, DATA ARE GENERALLY NOT USED AT THE SUBNATIONAL LEVEL TO INFLUENCE PRIORITY SETTING OR BUDGET ALLOCATIONS TO ENSURE THE GREATEST IMPACT IN KENYA.  THE ISS, THE BACKBONE OF MOH SURVEILLANCE, IS ALSO NOT UTILIZED ROUTINELY FOR SURVEILLANCE OF NON-INFLUENZA RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS WITH PANDEMIC POTENTIAL AND/OR WITH CAPACITY TO CAUSE SEVERE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS. THOUGH IT HAS BEEN LEVERAGED AT TIMES TO DETECT AND RESPOND TO DISEASE OUTBREAKS, INCLUDING NON-INFLUENZA VIRUSES AND BACTERIAL PATHOGENS, LACK OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ISS BEYOND ROUTINE INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A SUB-OPTIMIZED PLATFORM TO SERVE AS AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR DISEASE OUTBREAKS. IN ADDITION, RECENT EXPERIENCE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IDENTIFIED OTHER WEAKNESS IN THE GOVERNMENT OF KENYA\u2019S (GOK) ABILITY TO EXECUTE A STRONG OUTBREAK RESPONSE TO INCLUDE LIMITED HUMAN AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND POOR COORDINATION WITHIN/AND AMONG KEY MINISTRIES DUE TO LACK OF A PANDEMIC-PREPAREDNESS FRAMEWORK.  TO RESPOND TO THESE CHALLENGES, HJF MEDICAL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL, INC.

HOWEVER, THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE SHOWS THAT INFLUENZA HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. IN THE REGION, INFLUENZA VIRUSES ARE IMPORTANT RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS, AND ACUTE RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS, SUCH AS PNEUMONIA, ARE A MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH, PARTICULARLY AMONG CHILDREN. IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, MOST OUTBREAKS OF INFLUENZA GO UNREPORTED AND INFORMATION ABOUT CIRCULATING STRAINS IS RELATIVELY LIMITED. ALTHOUGH INFLUENZA HAS BEEN WIDELY STUDIED IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS EPIDEMIOLOGY, SEASONALITY, AND BURDEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN 2006 FUNDING WAS OBTAINED FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES INFLUENZA BRANCH IN ATLANTA, TO ESTABLISH AN INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM AND DIAGNOSTIC CENTER IN UGANDA. INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES WERE STARTED, AND THE UGANDA NATIONAL INFLUENZA CENTER (NIC) WAS REINSTATED AT UGANDA VIRUS RESEARCH INSTITUTE. OVER THE PERIOD OF FIFTEEN YEARS, INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE IN UGANDA HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, SURVEILLANCE CAPACITIES, AND LABORATORY VIROLOGICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CAPACITIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, NOT ONLY FOR INFLUENZA BUT FOR OTHER DISEASES TOO. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THESE CAPACITIES CONTINUE TO BE SUSTAINED AND STRENGTHENED TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE BUT ALSO TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GLOBAL DETECTION AND RESPONSE TO PANDEMIC INFLUENZA. THIS PROGRAM IS BENEFICIAL AS IT GENERATES INFORMATION FOR USE IN REDUCING THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS. THE PROGRAM WILL COMMUNICATE DATA ON A WEEKLY BASIS TO THE WHO GLOBAL INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE SYSTEM (GISRS), FLUNET AND FLUID, AND ALSO PROVIDE ISOLATES OF INFLUENZA VIRUS TO THE ATLANTA WHO CC FOR FURTHER DIAGNOSIS AND USE IN VACCINE PRODUCTION.THE PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST FOR FUNDING IS TO ENABLE UGANDA, THROUGH THE UVRI NATIONAL INFLUENZA CENTER, TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF INFLUENZA EPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS BY MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING THE EXISTING ROUTINE INFLUENZA SENTINEL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM AND DEVELOP CAPACITY TO MONITOR AND QUICKLY RESPOND TO HIGHLY PATHOGENIC VIRUSES AND BACTERIA TRANSMISSIBLE AMONG HUMANS (FROM ANIMALS), AS WELL AS IDENTIFY OUTBREAKS OF SEVERE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS SYNDROMES.

INFLUENZA HAS BEEN KNOWN HISTORICALLY FOR ITS PANDEMIC POTENTIAL AND THEREFORE REQUIRES ACTIVE AND PERSISTENT SURVEILLANCE. SEASONAL, ZOONOTIC AND PANDEMIC INFLUENZA ARE THE TYPES OF INFLUENZA OUTBREAKS THAT OCCUR IN HUMANS AND ANIMALS. THE MOST COMMON AMONG ANIMALS IS THE AVIAN INFLUENZA WHICH AFFECTS BIRDS. THE VARIOUS SUBTYPES OF INFLUENZA TYPE A VIRUS (AVIAN AND PANDEMIC INFLUENZA) HAVE PANDEMIC POTENTIALS BECAUSE OF THEIR ABILITY TO MUTATE BY ANTIGENIC SHIFT, FORMING NEW SUBTYPES OR STRAINS. THE NOVEL VIRUS SUBTYPES USUALLY HAVE CHANCES OF SPREADING GLOBALLY. INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE HAS A MONITORING AND INFORMATION-SHARING MECHANISM WORLDWIDE FOR THE EVOLUTION OF INFLUENZA AROUND THE WORLD UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE GLOBAL INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE SYSTEM (GISRS), COORDINATED BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO) GLOBAL INFLUENZA PROGRAMME (GIP).

EARLY DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THESE RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS IS THE KEY TO MITIGATING THEIR EFFECTS. THE NOGUCHI MEMORIAL INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH (NMIMR) WITH SUPPORT FROM THE GHANA HEALTH SERVICE (GHS) AND THE UNITED STATES NAVAL MEDICAL RESEARCH UNIT (US NAMRU#3), STARTED SURVEILLANCE FOR INFLUENZA VIRUSES IN GHANA IN 2007; WHEN OUTBREAKS OF HIGHLY PATHOGENIC AVIAN INFLUENZA A H5N1 AMONG POULTRY LED TO THE DEATH AND CULLING OF THOUSANDS OF BIRDS. THIS SENTINEL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM PROVIDES EPIDEMIOLOGIC AND VIROLOGIC DATA ON CIRCULATING INFLUENZA VIRUS STRAINS IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS ALSO ABLE TO DETECT AND RESPOND TO INFLUENZA OUTBREAKS. THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, GHANA IS ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WHO GLOBAL INFLUENZA AND SURVEILLANCE RESPONSE SYSTEM (GISRS) BY UPDATING DATA ON THE WHO FLUNET AS WELL AS SUBMITTING SAMPLES TO THE WHO CC IN LONDON. AGAIN, THE NMIMR COLLABORATES WITH THE VETERINARY SERVICES DIRECTORATE (VSD) TO CONDUCT SURVEILLANCE FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA AMONG POULTRY IN SELECTED AREAS IN THE COUNTRY. ALTHOUGH THE ESTABLISHED SENTINEL SYSTEM HAS BEEN EXTREMELY USEFUL, THERE ARE A FEW CHALLENGES. THIS SYSTEM IS HEAVILY BIASED TOWARDS INFLUENZA VIRUSES. THIS CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS DEMONSTRATED THE NEED TO INCLUDE OTHER NON-INFLUENZA RESPIRATORY VIRUSES AS WELL AS BACTERIAL PATHOGENS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A ROBUST SYSTEM THAT CAN DETECT EARLY THREATS. AGAIN, DUE TO REGIONAL RE-ORGANIZATION, SOME N EW REGIONS CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE INFLUENZA SENTINEL SURVEILLANCE SITES. THERE IS THE NEED THEREFORE TO EXPAND TO INCLUDE DETECTION OF OTHER PATHOGENS AS WELL AS INVOLVE NEW REGIONS AND PRIMARY HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR CLOSE COLLABORATIONS WITH THE VSD FOR IMPROVED CONTINUOUS SURVEILLANCE AMONG ANIMAL POPULATIONS AS MOST EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING PATHOGENS ARE ZOONOTIC IN NATURE.

IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE CAPACITY OF THE CURRENT SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM AND IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCE, THE CDC TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE OF CONSIDERABLE HELP.THIS PROJECT AIMS TO IMPROVE THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY DISEASES FOR EARLY DETECTION OF EPIDEMICS AND RAPID RESPONSE UNDER THE ONE-HEALTH APPROACH. EACH COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED WITH EXPECTED SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OUTCOMES.FOR COMPONENT 1 (INFLUENZA CORE ACTIVITIES) EXPECTED SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OUTCOMES INCLUDE: ASSESSING THE INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, ESTABLISHING COORDINATION WITH THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM INTEGRATING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND LABORATORY DATA, AND SHARING CIRCULATING VIRUS STRAINS WITH WHO AND CDC COLLABORATING CENTERS.WITH RESPECT TO COMPONENT 2 (NON-INFLUENZA VIRAL AND BACTERIAL RESPIRATORY AND VACCINE-PREVENTABLE PATHOGEN), EXPECTED SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OUTCOMES INCLUDE ASSESSING THE NON-INFLUENZA RESPIRATORY DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, IMPROVED CAPACITY OF THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM THROUGH INTEGRATED AND EVENT-BASED SURVEILLANCE, STRENGTHENED MECHANISMS FOR TRANSPORT OF NON-INFLUENZA VIRAL BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES, IMPROVED CAPACITY FOR DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES, AND AVAILABILITY OF THE VIRAL RESPIRATORY DISEASE PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PLAN.WITH REGARD TO COMPONENT 3 (RAPID RESPONSE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS OR OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH EME RGENCIES), MAIN EXPECTED SHORT- AND LONG-TERM RESULTS INCLUDE CAPACITY BUILDING FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER, RAPID CONTROL OF EPIDEMICS, AND CAPACITY BUILDING FOR THE COUNTRY IN EARLY WARNING, MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL HEALTH RISKS.IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROJECT, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HYGIENE WILL MAINLY COLLABORATE WITH PASTEUR INSTITUTE OF COTE D'IVOIRE, LA NOUVELLE PHARMACIE DE LA SANTE PUBLIQUE, THE LABORATORY OF THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, THE DIRECTORATE OF HEALTH INFORMATION AND THE ONE HEALTH PLATFORM.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "CIV", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": 250000.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "27f381d4-d12a-51fe-da66-6de6690faddd-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NU51IP000908_7523"}, {"internal_id": 144501668, "Award ID": "NU51IP000907", "Award Amount": 592806.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-08-12", "CFDA Number": "93.318", "Description": "STRENGTHENING SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE TO AVIAN AND PANDEMIC INFLUENZA BY NATIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES OF BURKINA FASO (2021-2026) - HUMAN INFLUENZA WAS NEGLECTED BEFORE 2009 IN BURKINA FASO, DESPITE THE 3 TO 5 MILLION CASES OF RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AND 250,000 TO 500,000 DEATHS WORLDWIDE. INDEED, IN BURKINA FASO, HUMAN INFLUENZA WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF DISEASES UNDER SURVEILLANCE. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE LARGE NUMBER OF LOCAL CHICKENS RAISED PER YEAR (44 MILLIONS) IN BURKINA FASO, AVIAN INFLUENZA AND OTHER POULTRY DISEASES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SYSTEMATIC VETERINARY SURVEILLANCE. TWO OUTBREAKS OF AVIAN INFLUENZA (H5N1) OCCURRED IN 2006-2007 AND 2015, RESULTING IN AN ECONOMIC LOSS OF AT LEAST US$8 MILLION TO POULTRY FARMS EACH OUTBREAK. WITH TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM NAMRU-3 CAIRO, CDC ATLANTA, AND USAID, A NATIONAL INFLUENZA REFERENCE LABORATORY (NIRL) WAS IMPLEMENTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND BEGAN THE HUMAN INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE IN 2009.AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SURVEILLANCE, ONLY INFLUENZA-LIKE ILLNESS (ILI) WAS MONITORED IN TWO SENTINEL SITES (LESS THAN 600 SPECIMENS ANALYZED PER YEAR) AND THE PREVALENCE OF INFLUENZA WAS 6.7%. WHEN SURVEILLANCE WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS (SARI), AT FOUR NEW SITES (OVER 800 SPECIMENS PER YEAR), THROUGH THE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT FUNDED BY CDC ATLANTA, IN 2016, INFLUENZA PREVALENCE INCREASED TO 16.57%.

THE OCCURRENCE OF COVID WITH ITS ECONOMIC AND HEALTH CONSEQUENCES HAS CONTRIBUTED TO REDUCE THE EFFORTS FOR SUSTAINABILITY OF INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH. IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE TO RESUME SURVEILLANCE OF INFLUENZA AND UNUSUAL RESPIRATORY EVENTS IN ORDER TO CONSOLIDATE THE ACHIEVEMENT AND PURSUE THE EFFORT FOR THE SUSTA INABILITY. THE NECESSITY TO STILL REINFORCE THE WEAK LABORATORY CAPACITY, THE LOW SKILL LEVEL OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND THE INSUFFICIENCY OF INTRA- AND INTERSECTIONAL COLLABORATION ARE MAJOR GAPS FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE CURRENT SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE SYSTEM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL WHICH INCLUDE INFLUENZA CORE ACTIVITIES AND NON INFLUENZA ACTIVITIES IS TO REQUEST CDC PARTNERSHIP IN SUPPORTING THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES FOR BURKINA FASO :  I) TO REINFORCE THE CAPACITY OF BURKINA FASO FOR ROUTINE INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, TO MONITOR, DETECT, RESPOND AND MITIGATE TRANSMISSION; II) TO IMPROVE THE COUNTRY CAPACITY FOR NON-INFLUENZA VIRAL AND BACTERIAL RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS SURVEILLANCE AND COORDINATION OF THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS OF THE SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITIES OF THE COUNTRY TO DETECT RESPOND POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS; III) TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE GLOBAL INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE SYSTEM (GISRS) BY PROVIDING SAMPLES TO THE WHO INFLUENZA COLLABORATING CENTERS TO THE ANNUAL VACCINE STRAINS SELECTION.

AND DETECTION OF FUNGAL AND OTHER OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN ARGENTINA. - IMPLEMENTATION OF A PACKAGE OF CARE USING POINT OF CARE TESTING FOR HIV DIAGNOSIS, CD4 COUNT AND DETECTION OF FUNGAL AND OTHER OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN ARGENTINA.  JUSTIFICATION: IN ARGENTINA, MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLHIV) ARE DIAGNOSED IN LATE STAGES OF THE DISEASE (ADVANCED HIV [AH]). IMPROVED ACCESS TO EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF HIV AND WIDESPREAD AVAILABILITY OF POINT OF CARE (POC) TESTS, COULD INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS RAPIDLY STARTING ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART), AND REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS SUCH AS HISTOPLASMOSIS, CRYPTOCOCCOSIS, TUBERCULOSIS (TB), AMONG OTHERS. RAPID HIV TESTS, USUALLY BASED ON LATERAL FLOW TECHNOLOGIES, HAVE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER LABORATORY-BASED DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS INCLUDING SIMPLICITY, PORTABILITY, AND RAPID TURNAROUND FOR RESULTS. WHO AND LOCAL GUIDELINES RECOMMEND THE INITIATION ART AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HIV DIAGNOSIS, INCLUDING SAME-DAY INITIATION WHEN FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE. IN AIDS PATIENTS WITH MENINGEAL CRYPTOCOCCOSIS OR TB WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT, IMMEDIATE ART INITIATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER FREQUENCY OF ADVERSE OUTCOME, AS COMPARED WITH LATER INITIATION. THE USE OF HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC TESTS TO RAPIDLY DIAGNOSE DISSEMINATED TB AND/OR CRYPTOCOCCAL INFECTION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT CANDIDATES FOR IMMEDIATE, SAME-DAY ART INITIATION. DUE TO THE HIGH MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF HIV AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE AVAILABLE TESTS FOR RAPID DIAGNOSIS, OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN IMMEDIATE, SAME-DAY ART INITIATION PROGRAM. A PACKAGE OF SEQUENTIAL POC ASSAYS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED, INCLUDING RAPID DIAGNOSIS OF HIV INFECTION IN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW THEIR STATUS, OR THE DETERMINATION OF THE IMMUNE STATUS ON PEOPLE WITH HIV; FOLLOWED BY THE RAPID SCREENING OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS, HISTOPLASMOSIS, CRYPTOCOCCOSIS AND TB.  STUDY DESIGN: WILL BE A PROSPECTIVE STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTATION OF A HIV PACKAGE OF CARE STRATEGY IN AN INFECTIOUS DISEASES OUTPATIENT FOLLOWING UP UNIT. THE FIRST PHASE WILL CONSIST OF TWO YEARS OF THIS STUDY IMPLEMENTATION AT THE HOSPITAL DR. JUAN A. FERN\u00c1NDEZ, LOCATED IN BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA. ACCORDING TO THE PHASE ONE RESULTS, A SECOND PHASE (YEARS 3 TO 5) WILL BE PROPOSED, AND WILL INCLUDE OTHER MEDICAL CENTERS OF THE AUTONOMOUS CITY OF BUENOS AIRES. OUR LONG TERM GOAL IS TO IMPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY ACROSS THE WHOLE ARGENTINEAN TERRITORY. STUDY PROCEDURES INCLUDE: 1) CLINICAL DATA COLLECTION; 2) RAPID HIV INFECTION CONFIRMATION (HIV-RDT); 3) POC FOR IMMUNOLOGICAL STRATIFICATION; 4) POC FOR SCREENING OF HISTOPLASMOSIS (HAG-LFA), CRYPTOCOCCOSIS (CRAG-LFA) AND TB (LAM-LFA) AMONG SYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS AND ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS WITH A CD4=200 CELLS/\u039cL; 5) STANDARD OF CARE PROCEDURES; 6) MANAGING AND CLINICAL DECISIONS; AND 7) STAFF TRAINING.  ANALYSIS PLAN: THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE WILL BE EVALUATED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INDICATORS: A) FEASIBILITY: AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES AND STAFF TRAINING TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM.

FOCUSING ON FOUR KEY STRATEGIES, THE CHSI TEAM WILL: 1) WORK TO IMPROVE/UPDATE POLICIES AND OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR QUALITY TB SERVICE DELIVERY; 2) INCREASE ACCESS TO TB AND DR TB DIAGNOSTICS, TREATMENT, AND FOLLOW-UP OF TB SYMPTOMATIC AND BACTERIOLOGICALLY CONFIRMED TB CASES; 3) SCALE UP INNOVATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES FOR IMPROVING HEALTH SEEKING BEHAVIORS, PATIENT EDUCATION TO INCREASE TREATMENT ADHERENCE; AND 4) ENHANCE SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY AND PERFORMANCE MONITORING BY BUILDING CAPACITY IN DATA COLLECTION, ANALYTICS AND DATA VISUALIZATION FOR DECISION-MAKING. CHSI WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE TB CASCADE OUTCOMES BY ENSURING THAT VARIOUS PERSONNEL UNDERSTAND THE PATIENT NEEDS, HAVE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE TIMELY QUALITY SERVICES, AND ARE FOLLOWING UP PATIENTS TO IMPROVE TREATMENT OUTCOMES. WE WILL IMPLEMENT CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT TO ENHANCE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE TB PROGRAM. WE WILL ALSO USE DIGITAL PLATFORMS FOR VIRTUAL CONSULTATIONS, PATIENT EDUCATION AND FOLLOW-UP, AS WELL AS IMPROVE PATIENT RECORD KEEPING. THE CHSI TEAM MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED WITH THE TB PROGRAM IN THE PHILIPPINES BUILDING SURVEILLANCE AND SERVICE DELIVERY CAPACITIES AT ALL LEVELS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE BUILDING ON OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIPS AT VARIOUS LEVELS TO IMPROVE AND ENHANCE TB IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES. THE TEAM WILL DRAW UPON SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FROM THE LOCAL UNIVERSITIES TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY.  OUTCOMES: THE CHSI TEAM WILL ENSURE WORK WITH DOH AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS HELPS IMPROVE CAPACITY TO DETECT, DIAGNOSE AND TREAT TB PATIENTS IN VARIOUS REGIONS WITH LARGE OUTBOUND POPULATIONS TO THE U.S. WHILE THE PROGRAM WILL ENHANCE TB SERVICES FOR ALL, IT WILL ALSO HELP ENSURE THAT THE OUTBOUND POPULATIONS TO THE U.S. AND OTHER COUTNRIES HAVE EASY ACCESS TO QUALITY TB PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES.  STAFFING: THE CHSI TEAM WILL BE LED BY MR. NILO YACAT, WHO IS A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH INCLUDING TB IN THE PHILIPPINES. HE WILL BE SUPPORTED BY DR. CHRISTIAN VILLACORTE AS THE TB/DR TB ADVISOR, WHO IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE USAID-FUNDED TB PLATFORMS AS ITS TECHNICAL LEAD FOR CLINICAL PROGRAMS. MR.

OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS, THE URGENT CARE INDUSTRY HAS TREATED A RECORD VOLUME OF PATIENTS FOR COVID-19 INFECTIONS. THE URGENT CARE ASSOCIATION (UCA) AND THE URGENT CARE FOUNDATION (UCF) SERVE OVER 11,000 URGENT CARE CENTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHICH ARE TREATING PATIENTS WHERE THE DECISION TO PRESCRIBE OR NOT WITH ANTIBIOTICS IS MADE SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.

SENTINEL SITE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ON HEALTHCARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS (HAIS) IN GEORGIA  PURPOSE AN EFFECTIVE HAI SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IS INSEPARABLE FROM A SEEMINGLY DIFFERENT SPHERE - INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL, BECAUSE AS THE QUALITY OF HAI DATA IMPROVES, IT ALSO BECOMES EASIER TO IDENTIFY AND TARGET WEAKNESSES AND DRIVERS OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION. A CAPABLE HAI SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM SHOULD INCORPORATE INFECTION PREVENTION STRATEGIES, AND HAVE AN OBJECTIVE OF LOWERING THE SPREAD OF HAI. SENTINEL BASED APPROACH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES FOR ESTIMATING THE BURDEN OF HAIS TO PROVIDE A ROBUST DATA MANAGEMENT PLATFORM, IT IS NECESSARY TO USE A DATA SOFTWARE FOR REGULARLY COLLECTING AND ANALYZING LOCAL DATA AT THE SENTINEL SITE LEVELS, WHICH IS SIMULTANEOUSLY SUBMITTED AND AGGREGATED AT A CENTRAL LEVEL. OUTCOMES SENTINEL SITES, SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION, LABORATORY CAPACITY, HAI CASELOAD, AND WILLINGNESS OF HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION AND STAFF TO PARTICIPATE, HAVE IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF EXISTING ROUTINE-BASED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM ON HAIS. A RELIABLE SYSTEM THAT CONTINUOUSLY COLLECTS HIGH QUALITY HAI DATA IN GEORGIA THAT IS THEN UTILIZED TO APPLY EVIDENCE-BASED IPC EFFORTS TOWARDS THE REDUCTION OF DISEASE RATES IS CREATED. THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY BUILDING A STRONG FOUNDATION THAT COMBINED AND HARMONIZED ACTIONS IN IPCN EDUCATION, HAI SURVEILLANCE, AND FORMATION OF IPC STRATEGY. AFTER BASELINE RATES OF HAI ARE DETERMINED DURING THE PROJECT, EVIDENCE-BASED IPC EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO REDUCE THE DISEASE RATES.

WORLDWIDE ERADICATION EFFORTS HAVE SEEN THE NUMBER OF REPORTED CASES OF WILD POLIOVIRUS (WPV) DECREASE BY MORE THAN 99 PERCENT. TODAY, POLIO REMAINS ENDEMIC IN ONLY TWO COUNTRIES: AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN. THE INSIDIOUS SPREAD OF THIS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING A NETWORK OF HIGHLY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS WITH EXPERTISE IN PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND APPLIED EPIDEMIOLOGY AND THE NEED AMONG MINISTRIES OF HEALTH FOR INCREASED SUPPORT DURING DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND ERADICATION CAMPAIGNS. WITH POLIO OUTBREAKS OCCURRING IN OTHER KEY FOCAL AREAS DUE TO CIRCULATING TYPE 2 VACCINE-DERIVED POLIOVIRUS (CVDPV2) IN COTE D?IVOIRE, LIBERIA, SUDAN, TAJIKISTAN AND NIGER WITH RISK OF FURTHER OUTBREAKS IN THE LAKE CHAD BASIN REMAINING HIGH, PROVISION OF TARGETED IN-COUNTRY SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE THROUGH SURGE SUPPORT HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE FIGHT TO ERADICATE POLIO.THE RESURGENCE OF OTHER VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASES (VPD) SUCH AS MEASLES FURTHER SUPPORTS THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION SYSTEMS IN VPD OUTBREAK COUNTRIES, AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS, GUIDANCE AND ADVISORY GROUPS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GLOBAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS. THE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS ACHIEVED OVER PAST DECADES TO ERADICATE POLIO, ELIMINATE MEASLES AND RUBELLA AND CONTROL OTHER VPDS INCLUDING TYPHOID, HEPATITIS B, CHOLERA, AND NEONATAL TETANUS THROUGH STRENGTHENED IMMUNIZATION SYSTEMS AT THE GLOBAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL HAS BEEN PUT AT RISK DUE TO THE OUTBREAK OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19).IT IS WITHIN THIS CONTEXT THAT THE TASK FORCE FOR GLOBAL HEALTH PROPOSES TO ENGAGE ITS EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF VPDS BY BUILDING COUNTRY, REGIONAL, AND GLOBAL IMMUNIZATION CAPACITY TO PREVENT, DETECT, AND RESPOND TO VPDS. THIS REQUIRES STRENGTHENED AND E XPANDED SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES AND RAPID, TARGETED OUTBREAK RESPONSE.OUR OVERARCHING PURPOSE IS TO UTILIZE THE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES AND EXPERIENCE OF THE TASK FORCE FOR GLOBAL HEALTH TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF VPDS, PARTICULARLY POLIO, WORLDWIDE. WITHIN THE TASK FORCE FOR GLOBAL HEALTH, THE TEPHINET PROGRAM AND THE CENTER FOR VACCINE EQUITY WILL ADVANCE THE KEY STRATEGIES LISTED IN THE CDC NOFO. WE WILL SCALE UP THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT WE IMPLEMENTED DURING THE PREVIOUS COAG AND ESTABLISH NEW PROGRAMS TO FURTHER BUILD REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND GLOBAL CAPACITY TO ELIMINATE VPDS.TEPHINET WILL IMPROVE VACCINATION COVERAGE PERCENTAGES IN HIGH RISK AND SPECIAL POPULATIONS BY CONTINUING TO BUILD CRITICAL SKILLS RELATED TO ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION DELIVERY, IMMUNIZATION CAMPAIGNS, AND SURVEILLANCE AND OUTBREAK RESPONSE IN PAKISTAN AND OTHER HIGH PRIORITY COUNTRIES THROUGH ACTIVITIES INCLUDING NSTOP PAKISTAN, AFGHANISTAN IMMUNIZATIONS SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING, AND THE STRENGTHENING SURVEILLANCE AND IMMUNIZATIONS SYSTEMS PROJECT.
