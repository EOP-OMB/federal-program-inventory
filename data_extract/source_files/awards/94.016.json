THE DARTT PROGRAM PROVIDES A DOOR-TO-DOOR SERVICE CURRENTLY COVERING THE MORE URBAN AREAS OF LC.  WE INTEND TO EXPAND OUR CURRENT RELATIONSHIP WITH TWIN TRANSIT, WITH WHOM WE PARTNERED IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC, TO EXPAND THIS DOOR-TO-DOOR SERVICE THROUGHOUT LC, PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS FOR OUR RURAL SENIORS.  THESE SENIORS MAY BE ACCOMPANIED OR MET AT THESE MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS BY THEIR COMPANION VOLUNTEERS WHO WILL BE TRAINED TO ACT AS COMPANIONS, NOTE-TAKERS AND PROVIDE OTHER NEEDED SUPPORT FOR THESE SENIORS.

ELLA PIPER, A DISTINGUISHED PHYSICIAN AND COMMUNITY LEADER IN FORT MYERS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.  THE CENTER HAS EXPANDED FROM A NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER TO A MAJOR FIVE COUNTYWIDE PROVIDER OF SERVICES WHILE MAINTAINING ITS NEIGHBORHOOD BASE. A BOARD OF DIRECTORS FROM THE COMMUNITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICIES AND OVER-ALL SUPERVISION OF THE CENTER. OUR MISSION IS TO ENHANCE THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF THOSE 55 AND OLDER AND MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE LIVES OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND FRAIL ELDERLY CLIENTS. \n\nTHE DR.

THE PROGRAM PROVIDES GRATIFYING VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES TO LOW INCOME SENIORS AND HELP FRAIL ELDERLY RESIDENTS TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY, MAINTAIN THEIR DIGNITY AND ENHANCE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME STRENGTHENING THE VOLUNTEER'S CAPACITY TO REMAIN ACTIVE AND SELF-SUFFICIENT.

ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND MENTAL HEALTH, DEPRESSION GOES UNTREATED IN 80% OF THE SENIOR POPULATION. STUDIES SHOW THAT AT LEAST 10-25 % OF ALL ELDERLY PEOPLE SHOW CLEAR SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. 1-5 % HAS SO-CALLED SERIOUS DEPRESSIVE EPISODES, AND 2-8 % SUFFERS FROM LONELINESS AND MELANCHOLY. THROUGH THE NATURE OF THE AGING PROCESS, CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND CONDITIONS SUCH AS DEBILITATING ARTHRITIS, OSTEOPOROSIS, DEMENTIA, DIABETES, RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS, BLINDNESS, ETC. SUBSTANTIALLY LIMIT MOBILITY THUS QUALITY OF LIFE IS DETERIORATING, WHICH ACCELERATES THEIR PHYSICAL PROBLEMS AND MOST OF THE TIME MENTAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS DEPRESSION.
