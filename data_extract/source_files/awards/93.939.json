THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKING STRATEGIES, COMMUNITY EVENTS, AND MOBILE OUTREACH, THE PROJECT?S OUTCOMES WILL INCREASE PERSONS WHO ARE AWARE OF THEIR HIV STATUS AND INCREASE RECEIPT OF INTEGRATED SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE SCREENINGS. TREAT: THE PROJECT WILL LINK CLIENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV TO MEDICAL CARE, INCLUDING ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT (ART), PROVIDE MEDICAL CASE MANAGEMENT, AND ENCOURAGE CONNECTIONS WITH RESOURCES THAT ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, SUCH AS SOCIAL SERVICES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. TREATMENT OUTCOMES ARE INCREASED RECEIPT OF HIV MEDICAL CARE AND ART AMONG PERSONS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED HIV OR WITH PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED HIV WHO ARE NOT-IN-CARE, INCREASED ACCESS TO PARTNER SERVICES, AND INCREASED ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL SUPPORT SERVICES AMONG PERSONS WITH HIV. PREVENT: THE PROJECT WILL SUPPORT HIV-NEGATIVE PERSONS FROM ACQUIRING HIV BY ASSIGNING THEM AN HIV NAVIGATOR TO CREATE AN INDIVIDUALIZED RISK REDUCTION PLAN, CONNECTING THEM WITH MEDICAL CARE THAT INCLUDES PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP), CONDUCTING MOBILE OUTREACH TO DISTRIBUTE RISK REDUCTION INFORMATION AND TOOLS (E.G. CONDOMS), PROVIDING THE EVIDENCE-BASED SHIELD INTERVENTION FOR INJECTION DRUG USERS, AND REFERRING CLIENTS TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINATES OF HEALTH. PREVENTION OUTCOMES ARE INCREASED ACCESS TO PREP, INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF CONDOMS, INCREASED ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL SUPPORT SERVICES FOR HIV-NEGATIVE PERSONS, AND INCREASED RECEIPT OF EVIDENCE-BASED RISK-REDUCTION BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS. RESPOND: THE PROJECT WILL CONTINUE CONGRESO?S PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PHILADELPHIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGH DATA SHARING AND ONGOING PARTICIPATION IN THE PHILADELPHIA HIV PLANNING GROUP WHICH WILL RESULT IN INCREASED ENGAGEMENT FOR CLUSTER DETECTION AND RESPONSE. CONGRESO?S HOLISTIC, CULTURALLY APPRECIATIVE HIV SERVICES WILL REDUCE NEW HIV INFECTIONS, REDUCE HIV-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES, AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PERSONS WITH DIAGNOSED HIV IN EASTERN NORTH PHILADELPHIA.

THE MISSION OF APEX COMMUNITY CARE IS TO ADVOCATE FOR AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS, THEIR FAMILIES, AND LOVED ONES, AND TO ACTIVELY PROMOTE EDUCATION AND PREVENTION IN THE COMMUNITY. APEX HAS 33 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE TARGET POPULATION.THE PROJECT PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION IS INTENDED TO COMPLIMENT AND EXTEND THE REACH OF EFFORTS IMPLEMENTED BY STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BY PROVIDING HIGH-IMPACT HIV PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO INCREASE IDENTIFICATION OF HIV DIAGNOSES, REFERRAL FOR PRE-EXPOSURE AND POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP & PEP), EARLIER ENTRY TO HIV CARE, AND INCREASED CONSISTENCY OF CARE. THE TARGET POPULATION WE HAVE CHOSEN TO ADDRESS IS MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM), WITH AN EMPHASIS ON MSM OF COLOR, AND INCLUSIVE OF THOSE WHO ARE MALE TO FEMALE TRANSGENDER. WE WILL DELIVER SERVICES TO THIS POPULATION IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF GREATER DANBURY AND LITCHFIELD COUNTY.THIS TARGET POPULATION IS IN KEEPING WITH THE PRIORITY POPULATION OUTLINED IN TO ?CONNECTICUT?S INTEGRATED HIV PREVENTION AND CARE PLAN 2017-2021?, WHICH STATES: ?REDUCE NEW HIV DIAGNOSES BY 15% BY 2021 IN THE FOLLOWING GROUPS: MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM), AND BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERIC AN/LATINO MEN AND WOMEN.?   IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE TARGET POPULATION, WE PLAN TO HIRE THREE NEW POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE COMPREHENSIVE HIGH-IMPACT HIV PREVENTION PROGRAM. WE WILL HIRE A FULL TIME LATINX COMMUNITY PROGRAM COORDINATOR, A PART TIME (0.6 FTE) BLACK COMMUNITY PROGRAM COORDINATOR, AND A FULL TIME PREVENTION NAVIGATOR. BOTH COORDINATORS WILL BE MSM AND/OR DIAGNOSED WITH HIV. THE LATINX PROGRAM COORDINATOR AND THE PREVENTION NAVIGATOR WILL BE BILINGUAL ENGLISH/SPANISH SPEAKING.THE BLACK AND LATINX COMMUNITY PROGRAM COORDINATORS WILL PROVIDE TRAINING TO ALL APEX STAFF MEMBERS TO INCREASE THEIR CULTURAL COMPETENCY, HUMILITY AND SENSITIVITY, TO ASSIST THEM TO BUILD TRUST AND BETTER ENGAGE WITH THE TARGET POPULATION. THEY WILL EXPAND APEX'S OUTREACH TO THE BLACK AND LATINX MSM COMMUNITIES BY PARTNERING WITH ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND BUSINESSES WHO HAVE CONTACT WITH THESE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THOSE WHO SERVE BLACK, LATINX, IMMIGRANT AND LGBTQ POPULATIONS, AND PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THESE PLACES, WHEN INDICATED, TO DECREASE STIGMA OF HIV AND MSM. THE COMMUNITY PROGRAM COORDINATORS WILL ALSO DEVELOP SUPPORT GROUPS FOR BLACK AND LATINX MSM, AS WELL AS GROUPS FOR THEIR SUPPORT NETWORKS. THESE NEW POSITIONS WILL WORK IN CONCERT WITH APEX?S EXISTING PREVENTION PROGRAM AND HIV CARE PROGRAM STAFF TO CARRY OUT HIGH-IMPACT HIV PREVENTION STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THOSE TO ADDRESS DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND PREVENTION.TO ASSIST WITH THE DATA COLLECTION, MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS OF THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITY, WE WILL PARTNER WITH RDE SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT E2PREVENTION, WHICH IS A COMPLETE, INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR THE COLLECTION, MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS OF DATA FOR HIV PREVENTION, HIV TESTING, AND PREP PROGRAMS.
