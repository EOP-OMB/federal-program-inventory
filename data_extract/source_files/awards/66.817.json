THEY ARE OFTEN THE CHEMICAL COMPONENTS OF OIL THAT POSSESS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TOXICITY RISK TO FISH. BECAUSE OF THEIR WIDESPREAD OCCURRENCE AND MANY SOURCES, BOTH COMBUSTED (I.E., CARS AND TRUCK EXHAUST) AND NON-COMBUSTED (I.E., CREOSOTE OR CRUDE OIL) RELEASES, IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO PINPOINT THE SOURCE OF PAHS FOUND IN WILD FISH POPULATIONS AND WHETHER PAH EXPOSURE IS EVENT-RELATED OR CONSISTENT WITH BACKGROUND LEVELS. \n\nPROPOSED WORK\nA BASELINE ASSESSMENT OF PAH STATUS IN WILD FISH THROUGHOUT THE STILLAGUAMISH WATERSHED AT THREE LOCATIONS: ESTUARY, LOWER-MAINSTEM, AND UPPER-MAINSTEM.
