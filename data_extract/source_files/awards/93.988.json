STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN PREVALENCE OF AND MORTALITY DUE TO DIABETES EXIST FOR THESE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS WHEN COMPARED TO THE NON-HISPANIC WHITE POPULATION (CDC, 2022B; INTER-TRIBAL COUNCIL OF MICHIGAN, 2020; MDHHS, 2022A; UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI EXTENSION, N.D.).  ALIGNING WITH MDHHS\u2019 2022-2024 SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH STRATEGIC PLAN, THE MDHHS-DPCP PRIORITIZES EQUITY AND ENGAGES COMMUNITIES TO BUILD TRUST, OVERCOME BARRIERS, AND EXPAND PROGRAM EFFORTS. THE CDC-2320 WILL ALLOW MDHHS-DPCP TO USE THIS APPROACH TO SUCCESSFULLY SERVE ALL MICHIGANDERS, WITH A FOCUS ON PRIORITY POPULATIONS, THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF 8 OF 13 STRATEGIES IN COMPONENT A (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13). EFFORTS ARE INTEGRATED ACROSS THE STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO AND PARTICIPATION IN DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT SERVICES AND THE CDC-RECOGNIZED DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM, AND TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) AT THE SYSTEM AND POLICY LEVELS.  THROUGH STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, MDHHS-DPCP HAS BUILT STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADDRESS BOTH STATEWIDE HEALTH AND THE NEEDS OF PRIORITY POPULATIONS. CONTRIBUTING PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE MI COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ALLIANCE, MI PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION, MI MEDICAID, AND MI HEALTH INFORMATION NETWORK.

IN THE CITIES OF HAMPTON (137,746) AND NEWPORT NEWS (184,587), ABOUT 18% OF THE POPULATION HAS DIABETES AND ABOUT 15% HAS PREDIABETES, WHILE IN RURAL NORTHAMPTON (12,085) AND ACCOMACK (33,246) COUNTIES, MORE THAN 21% OF THE POPULATION HAS DIABETES AND ABOUT 15% HAS PREDIABETES. IN THESE FOUR LOCALITIES, THE BLACK POPULATION COMPOSES FROM 30% TO 45% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION, COMPARED TO 20% OF THE VIRGINIA POPULATION. THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES IS HIGHER IN VIRGINIA\u2019S BLACK POPULATION (17.5%) THAN IN THE WHITE AND HISPANIC POPULATIONS (BOTH 10%).  PURPOSE: HEALTH QUALITY INNOVATORS (HQI), WITH COMPONENT B FUNDING, WILL REDUCE DIABETES-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR THE BLACK AND HISPANIC PRIORITY POPULATIONS IN HAMPTON AND NEWPORT NEWS, AND FOR THE BLACK, HISPANIC AND RURAL PRIORITY POPULATIONS IN ACCOMACK AND NORTHAMPTON COUNTIES BY IMPLEMENTING CDC STRATEGIES 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 AND 13.  OUTCOMES: TOGETHER WITH OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION SUBGRANTEES, WE WILL BUILD CAPACITY TO DELIVER LOCAL DSMES, NATIONAL DPP AND CHILDHOOD OBESITY PROGRAMS THAT ARE TAILORED TO PRIORITY POPULATIONS, HAVE STRONG REFERRAL NETWORKS AND ARE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES.

WE ALSO WILL INCREASE THE ABILITY OF LOCAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO DELIVER TEAM-BASED CARE THAT ENABLES IMPROVED DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT, AND OF THE ENTIRE DIABETES WORKFORCE TO ADDRESS BARRIERS RELATED TO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IN THE LONG TERM, THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE PEOPLE WITH PREDIABETES WHO REDUCE THEIR RISK OF DIABETES, CHILDREN WITH LOWER BMIS, AND FEWER PEOPLE WITH DIABETES WHO HAVE A1C LEVELS > 9%.  APPROACH: EFFECTIVE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DIABETES REQUIRES A TEAM-BASED APPROACH, WHETHER THAT IS IN THE CLINIC OR THROUGH CDC-FUNDED EFFORTS LIKE THIS.

THE GEOGRAPHIES WE SERVE CAN BENEFIT FROM THE SPREAD OF STRATEGIES THAT VDH IMPLEMENTS, SUCH AS THE HABITNU UMBRELLA HUB. THE RESULT IS EXTENDED REACH AND INCREASED IMPACT THAT MAKES SMART USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS.  IN ADDITION TO ALLOCATING 30.4% OF GRANT FUNDING TO CBOS (IN YEAR 1, BUILDING TO 35.9% IN YEAR 5), WE WILL FURTHER ENGAGE COMMUNITIES BY ESTABLISHING TWO REGIONAL PATIENT AND FAMILY ADVISORY COUNCILS (PFACS) THAT WILL AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF PEOPLE IN THE PRIORITY POPULATIONS WITH PREDIABETES AND DIABETES. WE WILL CONSULT WITH THE PFACS THROUGHOUT THE GRANT TO GATHER INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAKING DIABETES CARE AND EDUCATION MORE ACCESSIBLE, APPROPRIATE AND FEASIBLE.
