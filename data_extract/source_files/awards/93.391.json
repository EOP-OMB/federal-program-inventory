LOCATED ON THE NORTHEAST COAST OF FLORIDA, JACKSONVILLE HAS A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 846,949 RESIDENTS AND HAS BEEN GREATLY IMPACTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. AS OF 4/27/21, THERE HAS BEEN 89,072 CONFIRMED OR PROBABLE CASES OF COVID-19, 2,011 HOSPITALIZATIONS, AND 1,314 DEATHS. BLACK RESIDENTS, THOSE OF OTHER RACES, AND HISPANICS ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR COVID-19 AND HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS PRIORITY POPULATIONS FOR THIS GRANT. APPROXIMATELY 8% OF WHITE RESIDENTS AND 7% OF NON-HISPANIC RESIDENTS IN JACKSONVILLE HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH COVID-19. IN CONTRAST, 12% OF BLACK RESIDENTS, 18% OF RESIDENTS OF OTHER RACES, AND 10% OF HISPANIC RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH COVID-19.

TO DATE, 24% OF JACKSONVILLE RESIDENTS ARE FULLY VACCINATED, HAVING COMPLETED EITHER THE PFIZER OR MODERNA SERIES OR THE SINGLE-DOSE JANSSEN VACCINE. APPROXIMATELY 23% OF WHITE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN FULLY VACCINATED, COMPARED TO 14% OF BLACK RESIDENTS.

WHEN THE FIRST CASE OF COVID-19 WAS CONFIRMED IN THE STATE IN MARCH OF 2020, THE MISSION TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF ALL ARKANSANS WAS THREATENED. UNFORTUNATELY, HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE COVID-19 CRISIS HAVE ONLY HIGHLIGHTED THE LONG-STANDING INEQUITIES WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THE THREAT TO ATTAINING ONE?S FULL POTENTIAL WAS MADE EVEN MORE DIRE FOR RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE STATE. WHILE THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC IS PERVASIVE AMONG ALL POPULATIONS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LATINOS, AND OTHER MINORITY GROUPS HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER RATES OF INFECTION. AFRICAN AMERICANS HAD HIGHER RATES OF UNDERLYING CHRONIC CONDITIONS SUCH HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, OBESITY, ASTHMA, AND KIDNEY FAILURE.

THESE CONDITIONS STEM FROM ISSUES SUCH AS POVERTY, LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE, INADEQUATE HOUSING AND LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ?

NOW, MORE THAN EVER, THERE IS A NEED FOR A ROBUST PLAN TO ADDRESS THE LONG-STANDING STRUCTURAL FAILINGS OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO PREVENT AN EVEN GREATER RACIAL DIVIDE IN HEALTH OUTCOMES.

CVB IS HOME TO APPROXIMATELY 450,000 RESIDENTS, WHERE THE POPULATION IS 20% BLACK, 8.5% HISPANIC, 7.4% ASIAN, AND APPROXIMATELY 13% SPEAK A PRIMARY LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME AND 9% ARE FOREIGN-BORN.  WITH 35,510 CASES OF COVID-19 AS OF MAY 3, 2021, INCLUDING 6,269 CASES AMONGST THE BLACK POPULATION (17.7%), 2,088 CASES ARE AMONGST THE LATINO POPULATION (5.9%), 1,539 ARE AMONGST ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS (4.5%), AND 1,113 AMONGST OTHER RACES OR INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING TWO OR MORE RACES (3.1%), THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 HAS SPARED NO COMMUNITY IN CVB.  VBDPH PLANS TO ADDRESS EXISTING COVID-19 HEALTH DISPARITIES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES.  REPRESENTATIVES OF AT-RISK GROUPS, AS WELL AS MANY OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO SERVE POPULATIONS OF HIGHER RISK OF COVID-19 RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES, WILL SERVE ON AN EXECUTIVE HEALTH EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION (HEDI) BOARD. COMMUNITY ADVISORY GROUPS WILL BE FORMED OUT OF THIS BOARD TO WORK WITH SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE CITY (INCLUDING RURAL AREAS), CULTURAL POPULATIONS, AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THIS GROUP WILL HELP DEVELOP AND ADAPT EVIDENCE-BASED POLICIES, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE SOCIAL AND HEALTH INEQUITIES RELATED TO COVID-19 IN COLLABORATION WITH MAJOR ACADEMIC CENTERS INCLUDING HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.  VBDPH WILL LEAD AN INITIATIVE THAT INCLUDES CARE COORDINATION EFFORTS IN TARGETED COMMUNITIES TO HELP ADDRESS HOLISTIC HEALTH ACCE SS FOR OUR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO INCLUDE EXPANSION OF TESTING AND VACCINATION OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS RESOURCE AND REFERRAL ACCESS THROUGH A MOBILE TEAM OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS.  THE MOBILE TEAM WILL OPERATE DURING NON-TRADITIONAL HOURS INCLUDING EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS. THROUGH VBDPH?S PARTNERSHIP WITH CVB?S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, WE WILL USE DATA AND MODELING CAPABILITIES TO IDENTIFY AREAS AT HIGHEST RISK AND LOWEST OPPORTUNITY.  ADDITIONALLY, VBDPH WILL PARTNER WITH LOCAL EXPERTS TO INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS OF DATA AND REPORTING THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REPRESENTATIVE DATABASE AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICAL TOOL. THIS INTEGRATED DATABASE WILL CREATE A REGULARLY UPDATED DATA INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADDRESS CLINICAL AND POLICY QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO COVID-19 RESPONSE. VBDPH WILL COORDINATE A SCIENTIFICALLY, CULTURALLY, AND LINGUISTICALLY RESPONSIVE COVID-19 COMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE SO THAT THE AGENCY WILL BE ABLE TO REACH AUDIENCES OF VARYING CULTURAL, LINGUISTIC, AND LITERACY LEVELS.  THIS INFORMATION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT ENGLISH SPEAKING AND FOR AUDIENCES WITH AUDITORY AND VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS OR OTHER PHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS.

WHILE THE TOTAL CASE NUMBERS HAVE FALLEN AND THE NUMBERS OF DEATHS AT THE TIME OF THIS APPLICATION (556 DEATHS) SEEMS TO PLATEAUED, THE CURRENT GOAL OF THE DEPARTMENT IS TO CONTINUE VACCINATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT AND REINFORCE COMMUNITY HEALTH WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES.FROM THE DEPARTMENTS OWN VACCINATION DATA, WE ARE AWARE THAT ADDITIONAL EFFORTS ARE NEEDED IN THE LATINX COMMUNITY.

IN DOING THIS, WE CREATED AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR CONTINUED RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS, AND OUR CONTINUING WORK TO ELIMINATE ON-GOING HEALTH DISPARITIES. STRATEGY TWO ? DATA (CDC STRATEGY #2)COVID-19 UNDERSCORED THE NECESSITY OF DATA TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITY NEEDS AND DEPLOYING ASSISTANCE IN AN EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY MANNER. THESE EFFORTS REQUIRE THAT WE ENSURE THE ACCURACY AND EFFICACY OF DATA IN CAPTURING THE REAL EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE LIVING IN PRIORITIZED COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY COVID-19, AND TO USE THIS DATA TO INFORM OUR WORK AND PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED BY ORGANIZATI ONS AND PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES. STRATEGY 3 ? COMMUNITY (CDC STRATEGIES #3 AND #4)HEALTH DISPARITIES CANNOT BE ELIMINATED WITHOUT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY BEING FULL PARTNERS. SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION THAT ARE ROOTED IN WHITE SUPREMACY OBSTRUCT POWER-SHARING BY DESIGN AND WILL NEED TO BE DISMANTLED AND TRUST MUST BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE COMMUNITY.  DDPHE AND DPH RECOGNIZE THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF CONTINUALLY ASSESSING OUR INTERNAL CULTURES THAT PERPETUATE OPPRESSION AND WHITE SUPREMACY IN PRACTICE SO THAT OUR ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE BETTER PARTNERS WITH THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THIS INCLUDES BUILDING IN PROCESS CHANGES TO PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY TO ESTABLISH POWER-SHARING RATHER THAN HIERARCHICAL CONNECTIONS.DDPHE AND DPH ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO ESTABLISH A VIGOROUS EVALUATION REGIME THAT WILL ENSURE THE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN THIS SUMMARY AND OUR DETAILED WORK PLAN MEET THEIR GOALS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE COMMUNITY IS INVOLVED IN IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE METRICS AND CONDUCTING THAT EVALUATION. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES FOR INVOLVING COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND MEMBERS OF THE PRIORITY COMMUNITIES AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED.CDC FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WILL BE CRITICAL IN ACHIEVING THE ASPIRATIONAL AND TACTICAL GOALS DDPHE AND DPH HAVE IDENTIFIED FOR THESE STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES.

OUTCOMES: OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2021, THE PROJECT WILL (1) REDUCE COVID-19 HEALTH DISPARITIES IN PHILADELPHIA THROUGH A COORDINATED APPROACH THAT BUILDS ON CULTURALLY, LINGUISTICALLY, AND LOCALLY TAILORED STRATEGIES AND BEST PRACTICES, AND (2) BUILD PDPH CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO BETTER SERVE ETHNIC AND RACIAL MINORITY COMMUNITIES BY ASSURING AN EQUITY APPROACH IN ONGOING PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS PLANNING AND FUTURE EMERGENCY RESPONSES. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED THE CITY?S RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATION. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF MARCH 2021, BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE 42% OF THE CITY?S POPULATION, BUT ONLY 22% OF PERSONS VACCINATED. OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES REMAIN UNDER-VACCINATED AND AT ONGOING RISK FOR COVID INFECTION, A DISPARITY THAT WILL CONTINUE TO EXACERBATE HEALTH OUTCOMES IF NOT REMEDIED. THROUGHOUT ITS RESPONSE TO THE COVID PANDEMIC, PDPH HAS FOSTERED AN EQUITY-FOCUSED APPROACH BY ENGAGING A BROAD NETWORK OF PARTNERS IN TESTING, VACCINATION, AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON PROVIDING TESTING, VACCINATION, AND ENGAGEMENT SERVICES IN COMMUNITIES WITH THE GREATEST NEED. MOVING FORWARD, PDPH WILL SUSTAIN CONTAINMENT ACTIVITIES WHILE EXPANDING ACCESS TO VACCINE INFORMATION AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT PHILADELPHIA, PARTICULARLY IN ITS RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES.
