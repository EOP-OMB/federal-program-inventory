CURRENTLY, AQUAPONIC SYSTEMS USE SYNTHETIC IRON CHELATE AND NON-BIODEGRADABLE PLANT SUBSTRATES. AQUAPONIC SYSTEMS ARE COMMONLY DEFICIENT IN IRON, AN ESSENTIAL PLANT NUTRIENT REQUIRED TO SYNTHESIZE CHLOROPLASTS AND OTHER ESSENTIAL METABOLIC PROCESSES. WHEN DEFICIENT IN IRON, AQUAPONIC GROWERS LOSE PROFITS BECAUSE PLANT GROWTH IS STUNTED, AND THE WATER IS NOT CLEANED FULLY BY THE PLANTS FOR THE FISH DUE TO INEFFICIENT NUTRIENT UPTAKE. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATES WITH AQUAPONIC SYSTEMS TO ENRICH PLANTS WITH ESSENTIAL IRON, MAY BE USED IN BOTH COMMERCIAL- OR HOME-SCALE SYSTEMS, AND MAY PROVIDE BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS TO IMPROVE AQUAPONIC SYSTEMS. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IRON-CONTAINING HYDROGEL FOR AQUAPONIC AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS.

IN AN ERA WHERE DIGITAL ASSETS, SUCH AS CRYPTOCURRENCIES, HAVE ATTAINED OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS IN MARKET VALUE, THE NEED FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLABORATION IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT, BUT ESSENTIAL. RECOGNIZING THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF THE DIGITAL ASSET MARKET, THE DACH PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE A ROBUST FRAMEWORK THAT CAN ADAPT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND MAINTAIN RELEVANCE. THE DACH PROJECT'S IMPACT EXTENDS BEYOND THE FINANCIAL AND CRYPTOCURRENCY SECTORS, REACHING INTO VITAL AREAS LIKE HEALTHCARE, ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, ENERGY, TRANSPORTATION, DYNAMIC CONTRACTING/AUTONOMY AND WEB3.0 RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, DACH PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR INNOVATORS TO WORK TOGETHER TO MITIGATE AND DEAL WITH A RANGE OF RISKS, FRAUDS, AND SCAMS IN THIS SPACE. BY FOSTERING A PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH EXTENSIVE PARTICIPATION, THE DACH PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE AN INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT CATERS TO THE DIVERSE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF SOCIETY, THEREBY DEMOCRATIZING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND REDUCING INEQUALITIES. TECHNICAL CHALLENGES DACH WILL TACKLE INCLUDE DECENTRALIZED NOTIFICATION ATTACKS, MULTI-CALL TRANSACTION AUDITS, MALEVOLENT SUBMISSION OF MULTIPLE INVALID PROPOSALS, AND THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ON-CHAIN TRANSACTION VERIFICATIONS USING MULTI-SIG WALLETS. THE OPERATIONAL VALUE OF ADDRESSING THESE TECHNICAL RISKS THROUGH A DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATION (DAO) INCLUDES ELIMINATION OF INFORMATION SILOS THROUGH A DECENTRALIZED COMMUNICATIONS MODEL, IMPROVED ACCESS, AVAILABILITY OF ETHICAL HACKER CYBERSECURITY EXPERTS DURING THE FOUR STAGES OF INNOVATION, FRICTIONLESS ACCESS TO PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMER COMMENTS AS AN ITERATIVE USE CASE FEEDBACK MECHANISM, AND REDUCED PARTICIPANT APATHY THROUGH GAME THEORY. MANAGED BY US SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS, THIS ?INNOVATION SANDBOX? WILL OFFER A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT WHERE INNOVATORS CAN COLLABORATE, BUILD VALUE, AND MITIGATE RISK BY NORMALIZING BROADLY DIVERSE INPUTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A DUST NETWORK DAO COULD ENCOURAGE ADOPTING SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE SPACE EXPLORATION (I.E., CREATING A STANDARDIZED DEBRIS REMOVAL PROCESS). THE DAO MIGHT INCLUDE A SPACE TREATY EXPERT, THEREBY AVOIDING UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS. A START-UP IS ESTABLISHING A DAO TO BRING TRANSPARENCY TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. THE FIRST USE CASE IS RELATED TO CAMP LEJEUNE MILITARY VETERANS SUFFERING FROM THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF CONTAMINATED WATER. CAMP LEJEUNE VICTIMS HAVE FALLEN PREY TO PREDATORY LAWYERS SEEKING ACCESS TO OVER $6B IN FUNDS SET ASIDE BY CONGRESS. THE DAO WILL ENABLE COLLABORATION ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING DOCTORS, PATHOLOGIST, LAWYERS, AND MILITARY SERVICES TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF FUNDS INTENDED FOR VETERANS. ANOTHER USE CASE IS THE BATTERY DAO WHICH LINKS THE SALE OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GENERATION (I.E., ROOFTOP SOLAR PANELS) FROM LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND FAIRLY SHARES FINANCIAL GAINS USING DAO-BASED GOVERNANCE. THE ABOVE ARE JUST EARLY EXAMPLES, AS THE DAO WILL ENABLE SUPPORT FOR A WIDE RANGE OF INNOVATIONS AND COLLABORATIONS. LIKE CLOUD COMPUTING, WHICH NOW REPRESENTS THE EPITOME OF IT INFRASTRUCTURE PROVISIONING FOR ANY INDUSTRY, THE DACH WILL ESTABLISH A MODEL FOR INNOVATION WITHIN THE DIGITAL ASSET ECOSYSTEM.

PRESENTATIONS BY OPEN WORK EXPERTS AND STUDENTS AND WORKING GROUP DISCUSSIONS DEMONSTRATE CURRENT TRENDS AND EXPLORE NEW RESEARCH TOPICS. EXPERTS ALSO DISCUSS NEW SCIENCE ON OPEN WORK (ALSO CALLED ?OPEN ORGANIZING?). THIS NEW SCIENCE SHOWS HOW PEOPLE WHO WORK OPENLY CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TRANSPARENT THEY WANT TO BE AND DECIDE WHO WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THEIR GROUPS. THESE DECISIONS INCLUDE DETERMINING HOW PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS WILL BE INCLUDED AND HOW EASY IT SHOULD BE FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO REPRODUCE THEIR WORK. FINALLY, RESEARCHERS SHARE DATASETS WITH EACH OTHER TO SPARK NEW IDEAS AND COLLABORATIONS.

PRIMARY BATTERIES, WITH ENERGY DENSITY 3X HIGHER THAN LITHIUM (LI)-ION, ARE CRITICAL FOR APPLICATIONS WHERE HIGH ENERGY, RELIABILITY, AND PORTABILITY ARE ESSENTIAL, SUCH AS IMPLANTABLE/PORTABLE MEDICAL DEVICES (E.G., PACEMAKERS), UNMANNED VEHICLES, MILITARY AND SPACE DEVICES, AND REMOTE MONITORING SENSORS. THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE STRONG UNMET NEEDS FOR HIGH-ENERGY PRIMARIES BECAUSE THEY ALLOW LONGER-DURATION OPERATING TIME AND CAN FIT INTO SMALLER DEVICES THAN RECHARGEABLE LI-ION. DESPITE THE INCREASING DEMAND, THERE HAVE BEEN FEW FUNDAMENTAL INNOVATIONS IN CELL CHEMISTRIES IN THE PAST 40 YEARS, WHEN ALL CURRENTLY-KNOWN PRIMARY CATHODES WERE EXTENSIVELY INVESTIGATED. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY UTILIZES A RECENTLY DEVELOPED HIGH-ENERGY CATHODE CHEMISTRY THAT MAY BOOST THE ENERGY DENSITY OF THE CURRENT MARKET-LEADING SYSTEM (LI-CFX) BY A PROJECTED 50%, WITH GOOD SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS AND LITTLE/NO INCREASE IN COST. THE HIGH ENERGY DENSITY OF THE PROPOSED BATTERY SYSTEM MAY RESULT IN FEWER BATTERIES BEING NEEDED OVERALL (OWING TO INCREASED BATTERY LIFE), MITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PRIMARY BATTERIES GIVEN THAT THEIR USE IS UNAVOIDABLE IN MANY APPLICATIONS. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW CLASS OF ENERGY-DENSE CATHOLYTE (CATHODE + ELECTROLYTE) UTILIZING LIQUID FLUORINATED REACTANTS (LFRS). THE PROPOSED LFR CELLS EXHIBIT INTRINSICALLY HIGH ENERGY DENSITIES AND ARE ROBUST AND HIGHLY REPRODUCIBLE. MOREOVER, THE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN LFR AND SOLID CFX ENABLED A SIGNIFICANT EVOLUTION IN CELL DESIGN, WHERE LFR CATHOLYTES ARE HYBRIDIZED WITH SOLID-STATE CATHODES TO MINIMIZE THE WEIGHT OF INACTIVE CELL COMPONENTS (E.G., ELECTROLYTE SOLVENTS), AND THE BATTERY MATERIALS ARE MORE EFFICIENTLY USED FOR STORING ENERGY. RESULTS HAVE SHOWN A 20% BOOST IN ENERGY DENSITY OVER THE CURRENT MARKET-LEADING BATTERY, AND FURTHER IMPROVEMENT BY 50% MAY BE POSSIBLE WITH CELL STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION. CRITICALLY, THE CATHOLYTE IS INJECTED INTO THE CELL USING CURRENT PRODUCTION METHODOLOGIES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED CELL FORM FACTORS AND REQUIRES LITTLE MODIFICATION TO CELL ASSEMBLY, MINIMIZING SWITCHING COSTS TO BATTERY MANUFACTURERS.

THE GOAL FOR THIS PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS TO REDUCE FIREFIGHTER MORTALITIES AND MORBIDITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. APPROXIMATELY 92% OF OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARRESTS RESULT IN DEATH SUGGESTING THAT MANY PEOPLE DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE SYMPTOMS, AND DON?T ACT ON EARLY WARNING SIGNS. EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH RISKS (E.G., HYPERTENSION, ARRHYTHMIA, SLEEP APNEA) THAT INCREASE THE POSSIBILITY OF SCE, CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF DISEASE PROGRESSION, AND ADDRESSING RISKS IN A TIMELY MANNER MAY INCREASE THE CHANCES OF PREVENTING OR SURVIVING A SCE.

HOWEVER, CURRENT SHAPE NESTING SOFTWARE OFTEN FALLS SHORT OF OPTIMAL MATERIAL USAGE. CURRENT PRODUCTS NEST SHAPES SEQUENTIALLY, PLACING EACH PIECE ON THE SUBSTRATE ONE AFTER ANOTHER. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE PLACEMENT OF ITEMS ON A 2D SUBSTRATE MORE EFFICIENTLY. THE TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON THE SIMULATED EVOLUTION OF MULTIPLE, INTER-DEPENDENT SPECIES INTO A TIGHTLY KNIT, STABLE AND PRODUCTIVE ECOSYSTEM. THE RESULT IS A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN WASTED MATERIAL. IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY MAY MORE TIGHTLY NEST BODY PARTS TO BE CUT FROM STEEL SHEETS, REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF RAW STEEL NEEDED AS WELL AS THE SCRAP STEEL, WHICH REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL ENERGY TO MELT AND REUSE. THE TECHNOLOGY MAY BE APPLIED TO CLOTH AND LEATHER (TEXTILES), ALUMINUM AND STEEL (SHIPBUILDING), OR TITANIUM AND COMPOSITES (AEROSPACE). THE REDUCTIONS IN SCRAP MAY MAKE THE US ECONOMY MORE EFFICIENT AND WORKERS MORE PRODUCTIVE.

THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALGORITHM FOR SIMULATING EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION USING AN ECOSYSTEM STRATEGY. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM FOR DEEP-SCALE EVOLUTION USES MASSIVELY-PARALLEL SIMULTANEOUS CONSIDERATION OF GLOBAL LAYOUT PATTERNS, A NEW APPROACH DISTINCT FROM THE SEQUENTIAL PIECE PLACEMENT AND LOCAL LAYOUT DECISIONS USED IN AVAILABLE NESTING PRODUCTS. MILLIONS OF SPECIES (EACH A POSSIBLE PLACEMENT OF A SHAPED PIECE ON A FLAT SUBSTRATE IN 2D NESTING) COMPETE TO COVER THE 2D MATERIAL. THE BIGGEST SET OF COOPERATING (I.E., NON-COMPETING) SPECIES EMERGES. THE ECOSYSTEM PERSPECTIVE FAVORS LARGE SETS OF COOPERATIVE SPECIES OVER INDIVIDUAL, LOCALLY SUCCESSFUL SPECIES. CO-EVOLUTIONARY SELECTION PRESSURE PUSHES THE POPULATION TOWARD GLOBALLY OPTIMAL TOTAL SOLUTIONS. THIS EMPHASIS ON COOPERATIVE GROUPS OF SOLUTION COMPONENTS OFTEN WILL FIND TIGHTER, MORE EFFICIENT NESTINGS OF 2D SHAPES (OR PACKINGS OF 3D PIECES) THAN CURRENT SEQUENTIAL TECHNIQUES THAT PLACE ONE SHAPE AT A TIME, OR PACK ONE ITEM BEFORE THE NEXT. RECENT STUDIES COMPARING COMMERCIAL 2D SHAPE NESTING SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON ONE PROBLEM SHOWED THAT THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY NESTED TWELVE PIECES, WHILE THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT OFFERINGS NESTED ONLY TEN OR ELEVEN.

CURRENT ACTIVE RESEARCH USING WASTEWATER ALGAE FACILITATES A CIRCULAR ECONOMY BY ENABLING THE COMBINATION OF TWO BIOWASTE STREAMS, BASE SUBSTRATE ALGAE AND BIO-WASTE REINFORCEMENTS AND FILLERS, RESULTING IN MATERIALS THAT ARE BOTH EASILY RECYCLED AND BIODEGRADABLE. THE GOAL IS TO REACH A COMPLETELY CIRCULAR PROCESS BY USING ALGAE THAT ARE A BYPRODUCT OF MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER PURIFICATION SYSTEMS. END USE APPLICATIONS FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM INCLUDE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, FURNITURE, INSULATION, AND PACKAGING. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOCOMPOSITES MADE FROM ALGAE AND AGRICULTURAL WASTE. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS A MOLDING PROCESS THAT USES POROUS ALUMINUM OXIDE MOLDS TO PRODUCE STIFF BIODEGRADABLE COMPOSITE MATERIALS. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL PETROLEUM-BASED POLYMERIC MATERIALS, THE ALGAE RAW MATERIAL SEQUESTERS CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE DURING GROWTH, WITH 1.6 TO 2 GRAMS OF CO2 CAPTURED FOR EVERY GRAM OF ALGAL BIOMASS PRODUCED. AT END-OF-USE, THE MATERIAL NATURALLY DECOMPOSES WITHOUT SPECIALIZED RECYCLING TREATMENTS, AND MAY BE CRUSHED, REHYDRATED, AND REMOLDED FOR REUSE. IN ADDITION, OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF THE BIOMATERIAL OVER TRADITIONAL POLYMERIC MATERIALS INCLUDE LOWER ENERGY USE IN FABRICATION, ABILITY TO USE THE FULL ALGAE CELL IN PRODUCTION, AND COMPATIBILITY WITH MULTIPLE TYPES OF BIOWASTE FILLERS AND REINFORCEMENTS.

GLOBALLY, FRC REPRESENT ONE OF THE LARGEST AND FASTEST GROWING SECTORS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY. THIS GROWTH STEMS FROM THE NUMEROUS HIGH-PERFORMANCE APPLICATIONS FOR FRC IN A BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIES THAT INCLUDE AEROSPACE, DEFENSE, GREEN ENERGY, AUTOMOTIVE, MARINE, INFRASTRUCTURE AND ELECTRONICS. MANY OF THE COMPOSITE STRUCTURES USED IN THE HIGHEST VALUE APPLICATIONS ARE MULTI-LAYER LAMINATES THAT ARE EXPOSED TO REPEATED STRESSES OVER MULTIPLE YEARS (UP TO 30) OF SERVICE. THE PROPOSED SELF-HEALING COMPOSITE IS SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT PREVENTING PREMATURE FAILURE IN THESE LAMINATED COMPOSITE STRUCTURES AND EXTENDING SERVICE LIFE. IN ADDITION, SELF-HEALING FRC ALSO PROVIDE A MORE SUSTAINABLE PATHWAY THAT PROLONGS SERVICE LIFE AND ENHANCES RESILIENCE AND DURABILITY, MAKING SUCH MATERIALS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE IN COMPOSITE INDUSTRIES WHERE MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT AND ASSOCIATED DOWNTIME ARE COSTLY.

THE PROPOSED APPROACH RELIES ON MENDABLE THERMOPLASTIC (TP) THAT IS 3D-PRINTED DIRECTLY ONTO WOVEN FIBER REINFORCEMENT AND CO-LAMINATED WITH CARBON-BASED RESISTIVE HEATERS. THE PATTERNED TP EXHIBITS HIGH MELT-FLOW AND SELF-PRESSURIZATION FOR CONFINED MICRO-CRACK DELIVERY AT TEMPERATURES BELOW THE GLASS-TRANSITION OF THE COMPOSITE THERMOSET MATRIX. RAPID (MINUTES-SCALE) IN SITU THERMAL RE-MENDING IS ACCOMPLISHED VIA RESISTIVE HEATING. PRINTING TP DIRECTLY ON THE REINFORCEMENT INCREASES INTERFACIAL BONDING, RESULTING IN A COHESIVE FAILURE THROUGH THE THERMOPLASTIC INTERPHASE.

WITH ALMOST 80 TIMES THE WARMING POTENTIAL OF CO2, METHANE IS A SHORT-LIVED CLIMATE FORCE THAT DISPROPORTIONALLY IMPACTS CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM. METHANE EMISSIONS FROM LARGE, CENTRALIZED SOURCES (E.G., REFINERIES) CAN BE PROCESSED WITH ESTABLISHED METHANE-TO-LIQUIDS (MTL) PLANTS. HOWEVER, SCALING DOWN CONVENTIONAL MTL PLANTS FOR DISTRIBUTED METHANE SOURCES IS NOT VIABLE ECONOMICALLY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODULAR SYSTEMS THAT MAY BE DEPLOYED TO MITIGATE EMISSIONS FROM MORE DISTRIBUTED SOURCES (E.G., LANDFILLS OR ABANDONED GAS WELLS) ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT UNMET NEED IN THE EFFORT TO CURTAIL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS AIMED AT CONVERTING WASTE METHANE TO VALUE-ADDED CHEMICALS AT AMBIENT CONDITIONS AND MAY PROVIDE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE FOR CUSTOMERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL/SOCIETAL BENEFIT BY REDUCING EMISSIONS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

IN THIS SYSTEM, A PULSED VOLTAGE OR A PULSED LIGHT SOURCE IS APPLIED TO A CATALYST THAT ACTIVATES AND CONVERTS METHANE TO VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT PULSING A CATALYST WITH VOLTAGE OR LIGHT STIMULUS ENABLES CONTROL OVER SURFACE REACTION PROCESSES. CONTROLLING SURFACE REACTION PROCESSES ENABLES ENHANCEMENT OF METHANE CONVERSION ACTIVITY AND SELECTIVITY OF THE FINAL, VALORIZED PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO TAILOR THE PULSE PROFILE TO MATCH A SPECIFIC INFLOW GAS COMPOSITION AND CONTROL THE COMPOSITION OF THE FINAL VALUE-ADDED PRODUCT. THE PROPOSED ELECTROCHEMICAL CONVERSION AFFORDS THE USAGE OF MODULAR REACTORS THAT MAY OPERATE AT DIFFERENT METHANE IN-FLOW CONDITIONS.

INDUSTRIAL SECTORS SPANNING PHARMACEUTICALS, CHEMICALS, OIL AND GAS, AMONG OTHERS, PRODUCE CONTAMINANT-LADEN WASTE STREAMS THAT REQUIRE COSTLY, ENERGY INTENSIVE TREATMENT PROCESSES. DUE TO INCREASING REGIONAL WATER SCARCITY, NEW REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, AND SHAREHOLDER PRESSURE TO ADOPT SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES, THERE ARE SEVERAL DRIVING FORCES FOR INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE, IN-HOUSE TREATMENT. SEVERAL OPTIONS CURRENTLY EXIST FOR INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT, INCLUDING MEMBRANE FILTRATION AND ACTIVATED CARBON/CHARCOAL ADSORPTION. MANY INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES CURRENTLY USE ONE OR MORE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE CONTAMINANT LEVELS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE INTO THE MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT SYSTEM. HOWEVER, IN-HOUSE TREATMENT TYPICALLY RESULTS IN CONTAMINANT-LADEN WASTE STREAMS OR SOLIDS AND/OR DOES NOT COMPLETELY REMOVE ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: QUANTUM SENSING OF EXTREMELY SMALL CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE, HOST MATERIAL STRAIN, MAGNETIC AND ELECTRIC FIELDS WAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED WITH NV DEFECTS IN DIAMOND, WHERE OPTICALLY DETECTED MAGNETIC RESONANCE (ODMR) METHOD IS A KEY COMPONENT. HOWEVER, CURRENT SENSITIVITIES OF SOLID-STATE DEFECT-BASED QUANTUM SENSORS ARE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LESS THAN THE PREDICTED THEORETICAL LIMITS. A RANGE OF CONTINUOUS WAVE (CW) AND PULSED ODMR PROTOCOLS WERE DEVELOPED FOR IMPROVING DETECTION LIMITS OF QUANTUM SENSING EXPERIMENTS WITH DEFECTS. MACHINE LEARNING (ML) ALGORITHMS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE THE SENSITIVITIES OF THESE QUANTUM SENSORS. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF NV PHYSICS, INCLUDING CHARGE DYNAMICS IN ENSEMBLES, THAT ARE STILL NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD AND THUS REQUIRE FURTHER RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION. FURTHERMORE, CURRENT EXPERIMENTAL SOLID-STATE DEFECT-BASED QUANTUM SENSOR SETUPS ARE BULKY AND SMALL FOOTPRINT VERSIONS ARE YET TO BE DEMONSTRATED.

QUANTUM COMPUTING AND QUANTUM SENSING ARE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF EVOLVING QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES. WHILE MANY QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS QUANTUM COMPUTERS BASED ON SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS, ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO DO ADVANCED CALCULATIONS, THE NEED FOR ULTRA-LOW (< 0.1K) TEMPERATURES MAKES THEM CHALLENGING AND LESS ACCESSIBLE. THE TEAM FOCUSES ON STUDYING AND CONTROLLING THE QUANTUM DECOHERENCE IN HYBRID DIAMOND SPIN QUBIT-MAGNETIC EXCITATION (MAGNON) SYSTEMS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY SERVE AS SCALABLE QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING PLATFORMS OPERATING AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES (? 1 K) THAN SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS. THE PROJECT'S GOALS ARE TO DESIGN, FABRICATE, CHARACTERIZE, AND MODEL HYBRID ARCHITECTURES WHERE DIAMOND SPIN QUBITS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS ARE CONTROLLED BY MAGNONS AND SPIN CURRENT EFFECTS USING HETEROSTRUCTURES OF THIN-FILM OR TWO-DIMENSIONAL MAGNETIC MATERIALS.

TRADITIONAL COMPUTERS UTILIZE A ?BIT? TO COMPUTE AND PROCESS INFORMATION, CREATING A COMPUTER SPEED BOTTLENECK. QUANTUM COMPUTERS OPERATE ON A DIFFERENT KIND OF A BIT, A QUANTUM BIT, THE ?QUBIT,? WHICH CAN BE ENORMOUSLY FASTER IN COMPUTATION TIMES. SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS ARE ONE OF THE LEADING CANDIDATES TO CREATE QUANTUM COMPUTERS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO SURPASS MODERN SUPERCOMPUTERS IN SOLVING SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. A POPULAR WAY TO CREATE A QUBIT IS TO PATTERN A QUBIT CIRCUIT ON A LOW-LOSS INSULATOR/ METAL STRUCTURE MADE OF JOSEPHSON JUNCTIONS, COPLANAR CAPACITORS, INDUCTORS, AND RESONATOR WAVEGUIDES. HOWEVER, CREATING THESE CIRCUITS FOR QUBITS INTRODUCES DISORDER INTO THE INSULATOR/METAL STRUCTURE, CAUSING ERRORS AND LOSS OF QUANTUM INFORMATION.

CURRENTLY, NASAL CANNULA PATIENTS IN MANY HOSPITALS ARE CHECKED INFREQUENTLY DUE TO THEIR RELATIVE NON-SEVERITY COMPARED TO PATIENTS TREATED WITH POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION, AND CURRENT CANNULA DEVICES HAVE NO WAY TO MONITOR PATIENT VENTILATION. TAKEN TOGETHER, THIS LEADS TO DELAYED CARE DUE TO STAFFING SHORTAGES AND WORSENING OUTCOMES DUE TO THE LACK OF AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM OR ANY QUANTIFIABLE PATIENT DATA. A DEVICE THAT IS DESIGNED TO MONITOR THE OXYGEN DEMANDS OF CANNULA PATIENTS AND AUTONOMOUSLY REACT TO INCREASES/DECREASES IN PATIENT OXYGEN DEMANDS MAY IMPROVE OUTCOMES IN HOSPITALS AND ENABLE HOSPITALS TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES IN THE FACE OF RESPIRATORY THERAPIST STAFFING SHORTAGES.

GRAVIMETERS BASED ON FREE-FALL WAVE-LIKE COLD ATOMS AND MATTER-WAVE INTERFEROMETRY DEMONSTRATED COMPETITIVE SHORT-TERM SENSITIVITY AND UNPRECEDENTED LONG-TERM STABILITY. TRANSPORTABLE QUANTUM GRAVIMETERS MEASURING THE ABSOLUTE GRAVITY VALUE OR THE GRAVITY GRADIENT HAVE RECENTLY BEEN USED IN OUT-OF-LABORATORY SURVEYS. HOWEVER, COMPACT AND VERSATILE QUANTUM GRAVIMETERS WITH SIMULTANEOUS SENSITIVITY TO THE GRAVITY FIELD AND ITS HIGHER-ORDER DERIVATIVES HAVE YET TO BE DEMONSTRATED. THE THIRD-ORDER DERIVATIVE OF THE GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL, THE SO-CALLED CURVATURE, REPRESENTS THE CHANGE RATE OF THE GRAVITY GRADIENT AND IS SENSITIVE TO LOCAL MASS DENSITY CHANGES. MEASURING THE GRAVITY CURVATURE WOULD OPEN THE DOOR FOR PROVIDING HORIZONTAL RESOLUTIONS IN MINING EXPLORATION AND DETECTING NEAR SUBSURFACE SHALLOW DENSITY STRUCTURES.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: NOWADAYS, GRAVIMETERS BASED ON ATOM INTERFEROMETRY ARE ONE OF THE LEADING QUANTUM SENSORS TRANSFERRING FROM LABORATORIES TO THE FIELD. THE STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPACT QUANTUM GRAVIMETERS CAN MEASURE THE ABSOLUTE GRAVITY VALUE USING A SINGLE VERTICAL ATOM INTERFEROMETER AND THE GRAVITY GRADIENT USING DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF ADDING EXTRA ATOM INTERFEROMETERS, COMPACT QUANTUM GRAVIMETERS THAT CAN MEASURE THE THIRD-ORDER GRAVITY DERIVATIVE HAVE YET TO BE DEVELOPED. IN THIS PROJECT, THE TEAM AT RUTGERS-NEWARK AND AT UC BERKELEY AIMS TO DEVELOP SCALABLE LARGE-MOMENT-TRANSFER ATOM INTERFEROMETRY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURE ABSOLUTE GRAVITY AND ITS VERTICAL SECOND AND THIRD-ORDER DERIVATIVES. CENTERED AROUND ADVANCING ATOM INTERFEROMETRY WITH COMPACT MAGNETO-OPTICAL TRAPS (MOTS) AND EFFICIENT LARGE MOMENT TRANSFER, THE TEAM AIMS TO ACHIEVE THREE RESEARCH GOALS: (1) DEMONSTRATING THREE VERTICALLY-SEPARATED SINGLE-BEAM MOTS IN DIAMOND-SHAPED MIRRORS; (2) DEMONSTRATING ATOM INTERFEROMETERS USING A SINGLE RAMAN BEAM TO MEASURE GRAVITY AT THREE HEIGHTS; (3) IMPROVING THE SENSITIVITY WITH LARGE MOMENTUM TRANSFER BASED ON SPIN-DEPEND KICKS AND ADIABATIC RAPID PASSAGE.

THE CURRENT APPROACH TO TREATING MEDICATION-RESISTANT PARKINSON'S DISEASE, CALLED DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION, REQUIRES ELECTRODE IMPLANTATION INSIDE THE BRAIN TISSUE THAT CREATES POTENTIAL FOR SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS LIKE INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE OR STROKE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT PROVIDES A MINIMALLY-INVASIVE WAY TO STIMULATE THE BRAIN CONTINUOUSLY. THE STIMULATION DEVICE IS BEST SUITED FOR TREATING PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE DUE TO ITS CONTINUOUSLY OPERABLE AND PORTABLE NATURE. THE TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO EFFECTIVELY TREAT DISORDERS LIKE ESSENTIAL TREMOR, EPILEPSY, AND DEPRESSION, WHICH ARE TRADITIONAL CANDIDATES FOR DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION SURGERY. THIS METHODOLOGY CAN OPEN A NEW CHAPTER IN NEUROMODULATION TECHNOLOGIES BY OFFERING BENEFITS NOT SHARED BY PRIOR METHODOLOGIES OF ELECTRICAL STIMULATION. THIS COULD HAVE A HUGE SOCIAL IMPACT AS, ACCORDING TO THE PARKINSON?S FOUNDATION, THERE ARE 10 MILLION PARKINSON'S DISEASE PATIENTS GLOBALLY. SPECIFICALLY, ONE MILLION PATIENTS IN THE US LIVE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE, AND NEARLY 90,000 PATIENTS ARE DIAGNOSED WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE YEARLY. IN THE US, THE HEALTHCARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $52 BILLION A YEAR. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN STIMULATION IMPLANTS THAT USE THE SUPERPOSITION OF TWO SIMILAR GIGA-HERTZ ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES, TRANSMITTED BY ENDOCRANIALLY IMPLANTED ANTENNA ARRAYS, FOR CREATING A LOW-FREQUENCY ENVELOP SIGNAL TO STIMULATE DEEP BRAIN TARGETS IN A HIGHLY FOCUSED, AND YET MINIMALLY INVASIVE FASHION. THE STIMULATION IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING KEY FACTORS: I) GHZ EM WAVES CAN BE RADIATED VERY EFFECTIVELY USING ANTENNAS, A MATURE AND COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY. SINCE THE SIZE OF AN ANTENNA IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE OPERATING FREQUENCY, ONE CAN USE VERY SMALL ANTENNAS AT GHZ FREQUENCIES. (II) MULTIPLE SINGLE ANTENNAS CAN BE GROUPED TOGETHER TO CREATE AN ANTENNA ARRAY. THE HIGHER THE NUMBER OF ANTENNAS IN AN ARRAY, THE NARROWER THE STIMULATING BEAMS BECOMES, PENETRATING DEEPER INTO THE BRAIN TISSUE. (III) DUE TO THE SMALL WAVELENGTH OF GHZ EM WAVES, THE STIMULATION OFFERS TWICE THE DEGREES-OF-FREEDOM AS PRIOR BRAIN STIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES TO ACHIEVE FOCAL BRAIN STIMULATION. (IV) ADDITIONALLY, ONE CAN STIMULATE MULTIPLE TARGETS INSIDE THE BRAIN TISSUE WITHOUT CHANGING THE LOCATION OF THE ANTENNA ARRAYS. THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FLEXIBLE THAN STATE-OF-THE-ART INVASIVE ELECTRODES FOR BRAIN STIMULATION.

DRAWING UPON NSF-FUNDED RESEARCH IN COMPACT MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEMS THAT INTEGRATE BIOLOGICAL CELLS WITH MICROCHIPS, THIS PROJECT WILL EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A SMALL BUSINESS VENTURE TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL THE PROPOSED POWER SUPPLY AS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. AT PRESENT, MOST OF THE SMALL POWER SUPPLIES USED IN PORTABLE ELECTRONICS CONTAIN EXOTIC MATERIALS THAT ARE NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND CAN POSE A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK WHEN DISPOSED OF INCORRECTLY. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THESE MATERIALS ARE OFTEN IN SHORT SUPPLY WHICH CAN IMPACT THE FUTURE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING OF PORTABLE ELECTRONICS. THE RAW MATERIALS OF THE PROPOSED POWER SUPPLY ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND ABUNDANT IN NATURE. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPACT SYSTEM THAT CONSIST OF THREE MAJOR ELEMENTS: A SINGLE BIOLOGICAL CELL, SMALL MAGNETIC PARTICLES, AND A CUSTOM-DESIGNED MICROCHIP. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF THE SYSTEM COMBINES THESE ELEMENTS IN A UNIQUE SEQUENCE AND MANNER, RESULTING IN A COMPACT POWER GENERATOR THAT CONVERTS THE ROTATIONAL POWER OF THE INTEGRATED CELL INTO AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT IN THE MICROCHIP. INTEGRATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL CELL AND THE MICROCHIP AT HIGH PRECISION IS VERY CHALLENGING. WHILE PAST WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED SUCCESSFUL IMMOBILIZATION OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS ON MICROCHIPS, THE INTEGRATION PROCESS OF THE PROPOSED POWER SUPPLY IS UNIQUE BECAUSE THE INTEGRATED CELL MUST ROTATE CONTINUOUSLY AFTER INTEGRATION IN ORDER TO GENERATE AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT. FURTHER, LIKE ALL BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS, THE INTEGRATED CELL WILL AGE WITHIN THE SYSTEM, AND THIS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THE SHELF LIFE OF THE POWER SUPPLY. A KEY FOCUS OF THE PROJECT IS TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL NEED OF THE PROPOSED POWER SUPPLY BY THE COMMERCIAL MARKET WHILE MAINTAINING A PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN THE COST AND MANUFACTURABILITY OF THE SYSTEM.

THIS IS TYPICALLY DONE BY FIBER OPTICS, RELAYING DIGITAL ONES AND ZEROS AS PULSES WITH LIGHT ON AND OFF, RESPECTIVELY. FOR CLASSICAL TECHNOLOGIES, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO PRECISELY CONTROL HOW MANY PHOTONS ARE EMITTED OR DETECTED, ONLY TO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BRIGHT FROM DARK. QUANTUM INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRE QUANTUM INTERCONNECTS THAT CAN TRANSMIT SINGLE PAIRS OF ENTANGLED PHOTONS, WHICH IS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING. IN THIS REGARD, A COMPACT ELECTRICALLY-ACTIVATED SOURCE OF SINGLE PHOTONS WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT ADVANCE. ONE APPROACH IS TO UTILIZE SINGLE PHOTONS EMITTED FROM INDIVIDUAL ERBIUM (ER) ATOMS AT STANDARD TELECOMMUNICATION WAVELENGTHS. THE ER ATOMS MUST BE EMBEDDED INTO A SEMICONDUCTOR HOST TO ENABLE ELECTRICAL EXCITATION, AND GALLIUM ARSENIDE (GAAS) IS IDEAL DUE TO ITS WELL-ESTABLISHED GROWTH AND NANOFABRICATION. HOWEVER, ATTAINING EMISSION ONLY FROM THE ER ATOMS, RATHER THAN THE GAAS HOST, REMAINS A CHALLENGE. ONE WAY TO IMPROVE THE RATE OF PHOTON EMISSION FROM ER ATOMS IS TO EMBED THE ATOMS INTO NANOCAVITIES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE THE APPLICATION OF ER-DOPED GAAS NANOCAVITY DEVICES FOR QISE, WITH THE ULTIMATE AIM OF DEVELOPING AN ON-CHIP ELECTRICALLY-PUMPED SINGLE-PHOTON DEVICE OPERATING AT TELECOM WAVELENGTHS. THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER AN EXPERT IN RARE EARTH (RE) PHYSICS FOR CLASSICAL OPTOELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS FROM WEST CHESTER UNIVERSITY (WCU) AND EXPERTS IN SCALABLE QUANTUM PHOTONIC TECHNOLOGIES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE (UD). ADDITIONALLY, THIS PARTNERSHIP ADVANCES A NEW 3+2 DUAL DEGREE PROGRAM WHERE STUDENTS EARN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN PHYSICS FROM WCU AND A MASTER'S DEGREE IN QISE FROM UD IN FIVE YEARS. THIS ACCELERATED EDUCATIONAL TRACK IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT LOW-INCOME AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS, PROMOTING DIVERSITY IN THE QISE WORKFORCE WHILE EXPEDITING ITS GROWTH. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: CREATING SCALABLE AND RELIABLE QISE TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRES MATERIAL AND DEVICE PLATFORMS THAT PRESERVE QUANTUM COHERENCE AND PROVIDE SUITABLE INTERACTIONS TO PRODUCE AND CONTROL ENTANGLEMENT. DEFECT-BASED QUANTUM EMITTERS IN WIDE BANDGAP SEMICONDUCTORS HAVE EMERGED AS LEADING CANDIDATES FOR FUTURE QISE APPLICATIONS DUE TO THEIR POTENTIAL FOR SCALABILITY AND INTEGRATION. RARE EARTH-DOPED INSULATORS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED BECAUSE THE EMBEDDED RE IONS HAVE SHARP, STABLE OPTICAL TRANSITIONS AND LONG LIFETIMES THAT FACILITATE HIGH-FIDELITY QUANTUM CONTROL. RE-DOPED SEMICONDUCTORS, HOWEVER, HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED SIMILAR ATTENTION FOR QISE DUE TO THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF SAMPLES AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH COMPETING NATIVE DEFECTS AND BACKGROUND SPINS. IF THESE CHALLENGES CAN BE OVERCOME, THE RE-DOPED SEMICONDUCTOR PLATFORM COULD FILL A SIGNIFICANT GAP FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES BY PROVIDING A SPECTRALLY-STABLE ELECTRICALLY-PUMPED SINGLE-PHOTON SOURCE, QUANTUM MEMORY, OR ELEMENT OF A QUANTUM REPEATER OPERATING IN THE TELECOM C-BAND. IN THIS APPROACH, SINGLE ER IONS ARE COUPLED TO PHOTONIC DEVICE COMPONENTS, ALLOWING THE CHARACTERIZATION OF ER-DOPED GAAS AS A SINGLE-PHOTON SOURCE VIA ANTI-BUNCHING EXPERIMENTS. THESE NEW DEVICES WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTROLLED DILUTE DOPING AND BY ENHANCING THE RADIATIVE RATES OF THE ER IONS USING NANOPHOTONIC STRUCTURES.

CELLULOSE NANOFIBERS ARE CONSIDERED A VERSATILE BIOMATERIAL FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE AND MORE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS ACROSS INDUSTRIES. THE PROPOSED PROCESS EMPLOYS GREEN CHEMISTRY PRINCIPLES AND MAY GENERATE NANOFIBERS THAT ARE 10 TIMES CHEAPER THAN CONVENTIONAL NANOFIBERS FOUND IN THE MARKET TODAY.

LIVING ENVIRONMENTS, TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW DISEASE TRAJECTORIES ARE AFFECTED BY NEW TREATMENTS. BY CAPTURING SUBTLE BUT CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL FUNCTIONAL CHANGES OVER SHORTER TIME PERIODS, THE INNOVATION COULD REDUCE THE COST OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND BRING EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS TO PATIENTS FASTER AND MORE AFFORDABLY. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ABSTRACTION MODELS THAT SYNERGISTICALLY COMBINE CONVENTIONAL SIGNAL PROCESSING METHODS FOR WEARABLE GAIT MONITORING SYSTEMS WITH THE VAST EXPRESSIVE CAPABILITY OF MACHINE LEARNING REGRESSION AND THE SUPERIOR PERSONALIZATION PROPERTIES OF TRANSDUCTIVE INFERENCE. INSTEAD OF REPLACING CONVENTIONAL METHODS, THIS INNOVATION'S MACHINE LEARNING MODELS CORRECT THEIR OUTPUTS USING AN OPTIMIZED SET OF INPUT FEATURES, THEREBY GENERATING ACCURATE STRIDE-BY-STRIDE SPATIOTEMPORAL AND KINETIC DIGITAL MOBILITY OUTCOMES WITHOUT THE COMPUTATIONAL BURDEN THAT PLAGUES END-TO-END MACHINE LEARNING MODELS AND HINDERS THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN EMBEDDED SYSTEMS. BY LEVERAGING THE STRENGTHS OF TRANSDUCTIVE INFERENCE, THE INNOVATION'S MODELS PROVIDE UNPRECEDENTED ACCURACY OVER EXTENDED-TIME MEASUREMENTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SUBJECT-SPECIFIC LABELLED DATA. THIS NOVEL APPROACH PROVIDES ALGORITHMIC SUPPORT FOR NEXT-GENERATION WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY TO FILL THE ACCURACY GAP BETWEEN GOLD-STANDARD LABORATORY EQUIPMENT AND EMERGING WEARABLE GAIT MONITORING DEVICES, WHICH HAMPERS THE WIDESPREAD USE OF THESE SYSTEMS IN CLINICAL RESEARCH. BY WIDENING THE RANGE OF APPLICABILITY OF WEARABLE GAIT MONITORING DEVICES, THE INNOVATION WILL PROMOTE THE UNDERSTANDING OF REAL-LIFE AMBULATORY FUNCTION AND ITS TRAJECTORIES OVER TIME IN HEALTHY AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS.

IN ADDITION, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DELIVER OTHER CROP PRODUCTION MOIETIES IN CONCERT WITH NEMATICIDE, INCLUDING FERTILIZER, BIOLOGICALS, INSECTICIDES OR FUNGICIDES. PPN INFECTION OF CASH CROPS CAUSES AN EXCESS OF $125 BILLION IN WORLDWIDE CROP DAMAGE ANNUALLY, AND PPNS ARE REGARDED AS THE MOST DAMAGING BIOTIC CROP STRESSOR WHERE THERE IS NO VIABLE MANAGEMENT OPTION, STRAINING GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY. PPN IMPACT EVERY CROP PLANT IN EVERY AGRICULTURAL SETTING AND INDUSTRY INCLUDING SMALLHOLDER AND ORGANIC FARMING, FORESTRY, FIELD AND TRUCK CROPS, ORNAMENTALS, AND TURF.

THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO MATCH A READILY AVAILABLE MEDICAL GRADE MATERIAL WITH A REPRODUCIBLE 3D PRINTING PROCESS THAT CAN SERVE AS A VERSATILE PLATFORM FOR MULTIPLE TYPES OF FACIAL IMPLANTS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT SEEKS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT 3D PRINTING METHODS ON THE COST, TIME, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE PERFORMANCE OF 3D PRINTED POLYCAPROLACTONE (PCL) IMPLANTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE VARIABILITY OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND ITS EFFECT ON THE MATERIAL AND MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF THE MANUFACTURED DEVICES. THIS IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY FROM A RESEARCH BASIC POINT OF VIEW, BUT ALSO FROM A CLINICAL AND COMMERCIALIZATION PERSPECTIVE. THE PROJECT WILL INVOLVE A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE MEDICAL-GRADE PCL POWDERS/PELLETS USING VARIOUS 3D PRINTING TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS LASER SINTERING AND MATERIAL EXTRUSION. THE MANUFACTURED DEVICES WILL UNDERGO MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION AND MECHANICAL TESTING TO ASSESS AND COMPARE THEIR PERFORMANCE. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE A FOUNDATION TO ENABLE THE PRODUCTION OF IMPLANTS THAT CAN BE TESTED IN ANIMAL MODELS, A NECESSARY STEP FOR OBTAINING FDA CLEARANCE TO BRING THESE IMPLANTS TO MARKET. THIS WORK WILL NOT ONLY AID IN ENHANCING OUR FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD BUT WILL ALSO HELP IDENTIFY THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE 3D PRINTING TECHNIQUE FOR PRODUCING HIGH-QUALITY PCL-BASED FACIAL IMPLANTS.

THESE TECHNIQUES HAVE ALLOWED SMALLER INCISION SIZES, REDUCED TISSUE DAMAGE, AND FEWER MISPLACED PEDICLE SCREWS. DESPITE THESE TECHNICAL ADVANCES, STUDIES HAVE REPORTED 10-40% OF PATIENTS EXPERIENCE NEW OR RESIDUAL PAIN FOLLOWING SPINAL FUSION. MOREOVER, 15% OF PATIENTS NEED REVISION SURGERY WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF THEIR FIRST SPINAL FUSION.

ONE BROAD IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO MAKE A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE NOISE, VIBRATION, COMFORT OF VEHICLES. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS A META-SURFACE WHICH CAN BE USED TO CONTROL AND ISOLATE SOUND GENERATED BY A MOVING CAR.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IS A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, AND ?ONE OF OUR MOST SERIOUS HEALTH THREATS? ACCORDING TO THE CDC. THE WORLD HAS WITNESSED A SURGE OF SUPERBUGS THAT ELUDE ONE OR MORE ANTIBIOTICS AT AN ALARMING RATE. THIS SITUATION IS EXACERBATED BY THE LACK OF NEW ANTIBIOTICS IN THE PIPELINE AND INCREASING ACCUMULATION OF ARTIFICIAL ANTIBIOTIC WASTES IN NATURAL HABITATS THAT FURTHER ACCELERATES RESISTOME DEVELOPMENT. MEMBRANE-ACTIVE ANTIMICROBIALS (MAAS) HAVE BEEN WIDELY ANTICIPATED TO BE PROMISING CANDIDATES FOR NEW ANTIBIOTICS. HOWEVER, TOXICITY IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO THE TRANSLATION OF MAAS TO THE MARKET, OF WHICH THE INDISCRIMINATE HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTION THAT DISRUPTS BOTH BACTERIAL AND MAMMALIAN MEMBRANES IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY USES HYDROPHILIC NANOANTIBIOTICS THAT KILL BACTERIA, INCLUDING MULTIDRUG RESISTANT (MDR) BACTERIAL STRAINS, HIGHLY EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT DAMAGING MAMMALIAN CELLS. IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO UNDERGO RAPID DEGRADATION AND DEACTIVATION BY ENZYMES THAT EXIST IN NATURAL HABITATS WHEN RELEASED AS WASTES. THIS TECHNOLOGY POTENTIALLY MAY BE USED TO SOLVE THE CRISIS OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOCOMPATIBLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY BENIGN NANOANTIBIOTICS. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ASSEMBLY OF HYDROPHILIC AND ANTIMICROBIAL INACTIVE LINEAR-CHAIN POLYMERS INTO NANOSTRUCTURED POLYMER MOLECULAR BRUSHES (PMBS) TURNS ?ON? THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITIES COLLECTIVELY, WHILE DISASSEMBLY OF THE NANOSTRUCTURED PMBS TURNS THE ACQUIRED ACTIVITIES ?OFF?. IN ADDITION, NANOANTIBIOTICS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO KILL BACTERIA BY SELECTIVELY DISRUPTING THE BACTERIAL MEMBRANES WHILE REMAINING BENIGN TO MAMMALIAN CELLS. BECAUSE THIS MODE OF DAMAGE ACTS ON BACTERIAL MEMBRANES INSTEAD OF TARGETING BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAYS AS CONVENTIONAL ANTIBIOTICS DO, IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR BACTERIA TO PRODUCE RESISTANT STRAINS. NANOANTIBIOTICS LOW TOXICITY TO MAMMALIAN CELLS FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT THEY HAVE A GREAT POTENTIAL FOR CLINICAL USE. IN ADDITION, THE ENVIRONMENTALLY DEGRADABLE NANOANTIBIOTICS HELP SOLVE THE LONG-STANDING PROBLEM OF CONTINUOUS ACCUMULATIONS OF ANTIBIOTIC WASTES IN NATURAL HABITATS, WHICH ALTERS THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY IN SENSITIVE ECOSYSTEMS, THREATENS FOOD AND WATER SECURITY, AND ACCELERATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESISTOME. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENVIRONMENTALLY DEGRADABLE NANOANTIBIOTICS MAY REPRESENT A MILESTONE IN THE SEARCH FOR NEW ANTIBIOTICS AND MAY HAVE COMMERCIALIZATION POTENTIAL TO FIGHT DRUG-RESISTANT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS.

AQUACULTURE INDUSTRIES ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH SEAFOOD WITH OFF-FLAVOR COMPOUNDS (AROMATIC BYPRODUCTS OF MICROBIAL METABOLISM) THAT ARE CONCENTRATED DURING INTENSIVE RECIRCULATING AQUACULTURE AND DURING BIOACCUMULATION IN THE TISSUES OF FISHES. THESE COMPOUNDS CONFER UNDESIRABLE MUDDY TASTES AND SMELLS. OFF-FLAVOR COMPOUNDS IN SEAFOOD DRASTICALLY LOWERS MARKET PRICES, THUS, LARGE COMMERCIAL AQUACULTURE FACILITIES PLACE FISH INTO SECONDARY PROCESSES (DEPURATION) TO LOWER THE CONCENTRATION OF THESE COMPOUNDS BY FASTING THE FISH IN CLEAN WATER THAT IS DISCARDED. THIS PRACTICE RESULTS IN DRAMATICALLY HIGHER WATER USE AND EXPENSE, DELAYS IN GETTING PRODUCT TO MARKET, AND INCREASED OPERATIONAL COSTS. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH INTENSITY PULSED LIGHT LAMP FOR DISINFECTION OF RECIRCULATING AQUACULTURE WATER, MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER, INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER, AND RUNOFF WATER. THE TECHNOLOGY CAN ALSO BE USED FOR PREVENTING OFF-FLAVOR IN FARMED FISH.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO IMPROVE THE BATTERY LIFE AND PRIVACY OF WEARABLE DEVICES, ENABLING LONG-TERM MONITORING FOR BOTH PERSONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL CONDITIONS. THE SYSTEM APPLIES TO A VARIETY OF BIO-PARAMETRIC SIGNALS WHICH COULD BE USED FOR GENERAL CONSUMER HEALTH MONITORING THAT INFORMS USERS OF THEIR OWN HEALTH, MOTIVATING LIFESTYLE CHANGES, AND DETECTING EMERGENCY CONDITIONS. THE SYSTEM ALSO HAS APPLICATIONS IN INTENSIVE CARE TO IMPROVE THE COMFORT OF PATIENTS THAT ARE BEING MONITORED IN THE LONG-TERM BY REMOVING WIRES WHILE MAINTAINING A LONG LIFETIME. MONITORING OF SPECIFIC SIGNALS SUCH AS STRESS, EMOTION, SOUND, AND MOTION CAN PROVIDE UTILITY FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS INCLUDING SOLDIER MONITORING IN THE BATTLEFIELD, SOLDIER TRAINING, AND POST-TRAUMATIC DISEASES. THE SYSTEM COULD ALSO BE CUSTOMIZED FOR SPECIALIZED ATHLETIC SPORT MONITORING OR EVEN FOR SPECIALIZED MEDICAL CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS LIKE STROKE RECURRENCE COULD BENEFIT FROM HEART MONITORING, TEMPERATURE MONITORING CAN PREDICT IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VIRUSES SO PATIENTS CAN GET TREATMENT, AND RESPIRATION TRACKING CAN PREDICT THE RISK OF AN ASTHMA ATTACK. OVERALL, THE SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE HEALTH MONITORING FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND THE ABILITY FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS TO GET TREATMENT IN ADVANCE OF CRITICAL EVENTS. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTELLIGENT WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK PLATFORM FOR EXTENDED HUMAN HEALTH MONITORING THROUGH IN-SENSOR MACHINE LEARNING. THE TECHNOLOGY USES EMERGING BRAIN-INSPIRED HYPERDIMENSIONAL COMPUTING, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY VERY LOW COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY, TO MINIMIZE NET POWER CONSUMPTION IMPROVING NETWORK LIFETIME, SECURITY, AND PRIVACY. THE TECHNOLOGY ENABLES INTEGRATION OF A LARGE NUMBER OF LOW-POWER DISTRIBUTED SENSORS THAT WIRELESSLY COMMUNICATE INTELLIGENTLY DETECTED EVENTS/CLASSES. CURRENT SYSTEMS EITHER TRANSMIT DATA TO ANOTHER DEVICE FOR PROCESSING, WHICH IS VERY COSTLY IN TERMS OF POWER, OR ATTEMPT TO PROCESS LOCALLY WITH ALGORITHMS THAT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE AMOUNT SAVED BY REDUCING TRANSMISSION. TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, THIS PROJECT UTILIZES THE EMERGING BRAIN-INSPIRED HYPERDIMENSIONAL COMPUTING PARADIGM TO MINIMIZE NET POWER CONSUMPTION OF IN-SENSOR COMPUTATION. THIS PARADIGM REPRESENTS INFORMATION WITH FULLY BINARY VECTORS AND THUS THE ENCODING OF DATA PATTERNS INVOLVES ONLY SIMPLE BINARY OPERATORS SUCH AS RIGHT SHIFTS, MAKING IT EXTREMELY COMPUTATIONALLY SIMPLE.

LIGHTER SATELLITES REDUCE LAUNCH COSTS OR PERMIT GREATER PAYLOAD PERFORMANCE FOR A GIVEN MASS. LESS FUEL IS REQUIRED TO LAUNCH LIGHTER SATELLITES, REDUCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF GREENHOUSE GASES GENERATED DURING LAUNCH. INTERNET CONNECTIVITY THROUGH SATELLITE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY PERVASIVE, AND IF COSTS CONTINUE TO DECLINE, IT MIGHT BECOME UBIQUITOUS, SUPPORTING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH IN HITHERTO UNSERVED PLACES. MANY COMPONENTS, SUCH AS POWER SUPPLIES, CAN BE MADE LIGHTER AND SMALLER WHEN SILICON CARBIDE SEMICONDUCTORS ARE UTILIZED IN PLACE OF SILICON HIGH VOLTAGE DEVICES IN APPLICATIONS SUCH AS AEROSPACE AND SATELLITES. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO REPLACE ALL SILICON HIGH-VOLTAGE DEVICES IN SATELLITES AND AEROSPACE WITH SILICON CARBIDE PRODUCTS. IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT CONVENTIONALLY DESIGNED COMMERCIAL HIGH VOLTAGE SILICON CARBIDE MATERIALS CANNOT WITHSTAND THE HIGH RADIATION LEVELS ENCOUNTERED IN OUTER SPACE APPLICATIONS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, TEST, AND DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY OF SILICON CARBIDE HIGH VOLTAGE SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE RESISTANT TO RADIATION LEVELS COMPARABLE TO THOSE ENCOUNTERED IN SPACE. COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SILICON CARBIDE (SIC) POWER DEVICES ARE NOT APPROVED FOR USE IN HEAVY ION RADIATION ENVIRONMENTS DUE TO THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CATASTROPHIC FAILURE AND BURNOUT AT VOLTAGES BELOW 20% OF THE SPECIFIED VOLTAGE WHEN EXPOSED TO RADIATION. CONSEQUENTLY, SIC HIGH VOLTAGE DEVICES ARE NOT CURRENTLY USED IN SPACE APPLICATIONS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY OFFER VERY COMPELLING FEATURES FOR MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.

THE PROPOSED PORTABLE, ONSITE PATHOGEN DETECTOR WILL ALLOW FOR FAST, SPECIFIC, SENSITIVE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE PATHOGEN TESTS THAT CAN BE CONDUCTED WITH MINIMAL PERSONNEL TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT. THE SOLUTION IS INTENDED TO BE USED AT HEALTHCARE CENTERS, TRANSPORT NODES, DEFENSE FACILITIES, AND ANY OTHER SITE WHERE THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES IS A POSSIBILITY. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BENEFIT THE POPULATION?S HEALTH AND WELFARE, BY FACILITATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PATHOGEN DETECTION ROUTINES THAT REDUCE THE RISK OF LARGE-SCALE INFECTIONS. SUCH INFECTIONS DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECT UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS.

THIS PROJECT COULD DEVELOP AN ACCURATE MACHINE LEARNING-BASED PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR STREP THROAT. THE BUSINESS MODEL DELIVERS AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)-BASED CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM AS A SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE SUBSCRIPTION TO URGENT CARE TELEHEALTH SERVICES. THE TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET FOR ALL TELEHEALTH POINT OF CARE TESTS (BEYOND STREP THROAT) IN URGENT CARE AND PRIMARY CARE IS $10.4 BILLION. THIS SOLUTION IMPACTS ANTIBIOTIC OVERPRESCRIBING AND ECONOMICS OF HEALTH SERVICES. CURRENTLY, 34% OF CHILDREN AND 75% OF ADULTS WITH PHARYNGITIS RECEIVE UNNECESSARY ANTIBIOTICS, AND THIS IS 10-21% WORSE WITH TELEHEALTH. A REMOTE POINT OF CARE PREDICTION FOR STREP THROAT CAN POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE $22 MILLION/YEAR COSTS IN UNNECESSARY ANTIBIOTICS AND REDUCE DRIVERS FOR DRUG-RESISTANT BACTERIA.

EVEN THOUGH >80% OF RARE DISEASES ARE GENETIC IN ORIGIN, THERE HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY FEW ACTUAL DRUG DISCOVERIES. THIS IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM AS 30% OF CHILDREN WITH RARE DISEASES WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE THEIR 5TH BIRTHDAYS. TO ADDRESS THIS, DRUG DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACCELERATED BY SCREENING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS AGAINST MICRO-ORGANS (?ORGANOIDS?) THAT RESEMBLE YOUNG ORGANS AND HAVE THE SAME GENE MUTATIONS AS THE PATIENTS. IN A SIMPLE PETRI DISH, ORGANOIDS ENABLE THE DIRECT STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A PATIENT?S GENES AND HIS/HER DISEASE. SUCH ORGANOIDS PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY NEW DISEASE MECHANISMS AND TARGETED THERAPIES. THE TEAM IS SCALING ORGANOID TECHNOLOGY INTO AN AUTOMATED DRUG DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM THAT IS HIGH THROUGHPUT, ROBUST, AND APPLICABLE TO MULTIPLE GENETIC DISEASES IN CHILDREN. THIS PROJECT ADVANCES DRUG DEVELOPMENT FOR PEDIATRIC RARE DISEASES BY ACCOMPLISHING TWO PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: (1) AUTOMATED HEART, LIVER, AND BRAIN ORGANOID DERIVATION FROM HUMAN STEM CELLS, AND (2) AUTOMATED MACHINE LEARNING (ML) DETECTION OF DISEASE IN ORGANOIDS DERIVED FROM PATIENTS WITH GENETIC DISEASES AFFECTING ANY OF THESE THREE ORGANS. TO DO THIS, A COMBINATION OF ROBOTICS AND SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS WILL DIFFERENTIATE TISSUE- AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC ORGANOIDS UNDER STANDARDIZED CONDITIONS. THE ORGANOIDS ARE MONITORED WITH MICROSCOPY AS THEY TRANSITION BETWEEN TISSUE STATE. THE ML MODEL LEARNS WHAT HEALTHY ORGANOIDS LOOK LIKE AND USES THAT INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY WHEN AN ORGANOID EXHIBITS A DISEASE PHENOTYPE. THESE OBJECTIVES ARE IMPORTANT FOR REDUCING BATCH-TO-BATCH ORGANOID VARIABILITY AND HUMAN ERROR THAT CAN CONFOUND DRUG DISCOVERY EFFORTS. IN THESE SAME ORGANOID MODELS, DRUG SCREENING AND DEVELOPMENT WILL BE PERFORMED TO TRY TO REVERSE OR RETARD THE DISEASE PHENOTYPE UNIQUE TO EACH DISEASE.

THE MAJORITY OF ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY IS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND THIS RECENT SHORTAGE HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR DOMESTIC FOUNDRIES BOTH FOR ECONOMIC VITALITY IN THE U.S. AS WELL AS NATIONAL SECURITY AND SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY. IN 2019, AMERICAN SEMICONDUCTOR FOUNDRIES DIRECTLY EMPLOYED 184,600 WORKERS, DOWN FROM 292,100 (-37%) IN 2001. THE MAIN LOSS OF MANUFACTURING JOBS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE UTILIZATION OF OFFSHORE FOUNDRIES. CURRENTLY, U.S. SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING REPRESENTS JUST 1% OF GLOBAL CAPACITY AND 80% OF U.S. SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY IS IN THE 200 MM (8-INCH) FORMAT, WHICH IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE MOST ADVANCED, HIGH-PERFORMANCE PROCESSES, LIMITING PRODUCTION TO >65 NM NODES.

NK CELLS ARE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE ALMOST ANY CANCEROUS CELL IN THE BODY AND CAN TARGET BOTH SOLID TUMORS AND BLOOD CANCERS. THIS GIVES NK CELLS A BROAD APPEAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF MANY TYPES OF CANCER. THE TEAM PROPOSES A BROAD-SPECTRUM CANCER TREATMENT BY MODIFYING NK CELLS TO BE MORE REACTIVE TO CANCEROUS CELLS IN THE BODY. THESE MODIFIED NK CELLS COULD POTENTIALLY BE COMBINED WITH CURRENT THERAPIES TO ENHANCE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, WITHOUT INCREASING SIDE-EFFECTS IN PATIENTS. THIS PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 40% OF INDIVIDUALS WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE. THIS PROJECT WILL USE A PATENTED EPIGENETIC MODIFIER TO ENHANCE THE TUMOR KILLING ABILITIES OF NK CELLS. MANY IMMUNE CELL-BASED THERAPIES RELY ON ALTERING THE GENETIC CODE OF THE CELL THAT WILL BE USED TO TREAT DISEASE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ASSOCIATED RISKS IN ALTERING THE GENETIC CODE AND OFTEN THE CELL THERAPY MAY ONLY WORK ON A VERY SPECIFIC SUBTYPE OF CANCER. EPIGENETIC MODIFIERS DO NOT CHANGE THE UNDERLYING DNA SEQUENCE BUT CAN EFFECTIVELY ALTER GENE EXPRESSION. FURTHERMORE, NK CELLS CAN TARGET A BROAD-SPECTRUM OF CANCERS BUT IN MANY CANCER PATIENTS THEIR TUMOR KILLING ABILITY IS OFTEN SUPPRESSED. THE RESEARCH GOAL IS TO USE THE PATENTED EPIGENETIC MODIFIER TO INCREASE EXPRESSION OF KEY NK CELLS GENES THAT WILL MAKE THEM MORE SENSITIVE TO DETECTING AND KILLING CANCER CELLS.

THE TOTAL COST OF ILLNESSES DUE TO SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION IN THE U.S. ALONE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE GREATER THAN $10.69 BILLION IN 2018. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE MULTIPLE TRANSFORMATIVE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES FOR DETECTING SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION ALONG THE POULTRY SUPPLY CHAIN, LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DATA-DRIVEN DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE FOOD SAFETY, SECURITY, EQUITY, EFFICIENCY, AND RESILIENCE. BY DEVELOPING MULTI-SECTORAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE POULTRY INDUSTRY, RETAIL MARKETS, FOOD BANKS, AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER A MULTIDISCIPLINARY GROUP OF RESEARCHERS ACROSS FIVE INSTITUTIONS TO INVESTIGATE AND IMPLEMENT AN INTEGRATED SENSOR-ENABLED FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND SALMONELLA MITIGATION TO ACHIEVE SYSTEM-WIDE EQUITABLE FOOD SAFETY AND BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE ADAPTED FOR THE DETECTION OF OTHER FOODBORNE PATHOGENS IN BEEF, PORK, DAIRY, AND GREEN LEAF PRODUCTS. IT MAY ALSO BE APPLIED TO DIAGNOSE BACTERIAL AND VIRAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN CLINICAL SETTINGS. THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY WILL ENSURE EQUITABLE FOOD SECURITY FOR LOCAL AND GLOBAL CONSUMERS AND REDUCE THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF FOODBORNE DISEASES, ESPECIALLY FOR VULNERABLE AND UNDERPRIVILEGED POPULATIONS WHO ARE FACING HIGHER FOOD SECURITY RISKS. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL WORK ALONGSIDE MULTISECTORAL PARTNERS TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS IN FOOD NUTRITION, ACCESSIBILITY, AND EQUITY. THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE RESEARCH AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN ABOUT THE CONVERGENCE SCIENCE APPROACHES AT THE INTERSECTION OF FOOD SCIENCE, PUBLIC HEALTH, ANIMAL SCIENCES, DATA SCIENCE, AND SENSING TECHNOLOGY. THE TEAM WILL EXPAND ENGAGEMENT WITH UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS BY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENT RESEARCH EXPERIENCES, ENGAGING RESEARCHERS, PARTNERING WITH THE INDUSTRY WORKFORCE (E.G., INCLUDING IMMIGRANT WORKERS) AND MULTI-SECTORAL STAKEHOLDERS, AND INCORPORATING DATA ABOUT UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS INTO THE PROPOSED SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED SENSING TECHNOLOGIES ARE UNIQUE IN TERMS OF MULTIPLEX/SIMULTANEOUS, QUANTITATIVE, AND SELECTIVE DETECTION, AND SURVEILLANCE OF SALMONELLA SEROVARS AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN 30 MINUTES ASSAY TIME. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY DEVELOPING A SURFACE ENHANCED RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY (SERS) SENSOR ON A SIDE POLISHED MULTIMODE OPTICAL FIBER CORE, WHICH IS INTEGRATED INTO A 3-DIMENSIONAL PRINTED MICROSTRUCTURE AT A 15-DEGREE ANGLE TO MAXIMIZE THE INTERACTION OF THE EXCITATION LASER WITH THE ANALYTES, WHILE THE NANOANTENNA ARRAYS WILL BE CREATED USING LOW-COST MICROSPHERE PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY. SALMONELLA ANTIGENS WILL BE DETECTED AND QUANTIFIED BY MEASURING THEIR VIBRATIONAL FINGERPRINT SERS SPECTRA. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INTEGRATE MULTIPLE INNOVATIVE FEATURES OF AN IMPEDANCE-BASED BIOSENSOR ON THE SAME CHIP TO CONCENTRATE THE VIRAL ANTIGEN SAMPLE TO A DETECTABLE THRESHOLD, CAPTURE, AND DETECT THE PATHOGENS USING ARRAYS OF ELECTRODES COATED WITH SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES TO ENABLE SIMULTANEOUS AND SELECTIVE DETECTION OF SALMONELLA SEROVARS. INSTEAD OF TIMELY AND COSTLY WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING, THE NANOPORE-FACILITATED, MULTI-LOCUS CHECKPOINT SEQUENCING SENSOR DIFFERENTIATES SALMONELLA SEROVARS BY RAPID SCREENING A PANEL OF SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE-VARIATION SEROTYPING MARKERS DISTRIBUTED IN ONE OR MULTI-LOCUS.

AN ESTIMATED 70% OF THE BLIND ARE UNEMPLOYED YET, OF THAT SUBPOPULATION THAT IS BRAILLE LITERATE, ONLY 10% ARE UNEMPLOYED. THERE IS A BRAILLE LITERACY CRISIS - ONLY 8.5% OF THE BLIND POPULATION IN THE US CAN READ BRAILLE TODAY, COMPARED TO 50% IN THE 1960S. THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS THEORIZED TO CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING BRAILLE ILLITERACY INCLUDING: 1) A SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS QUALIFIED TO TEACH BRAILLE, 2) NEGATIVE OUTLOOKS ON THE DIFFICULTY AND COST OF BRAILLE LEARNING, AND 3) AND DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING BLIND STUDENTS INTO MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS THAT DON?T HAVE THE SPECIALIZED RESOURCES FOR THIS POPULATION. THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL ASSIST STUDENTS OF ALL AGES IN LEARNING HOW TO READ BRAILLE, INCLUDING SECONDARY BRAILLE LEARNERS WHO BECOME BLIND LATER IN LIFE. AIMING AT INHIBITING THE BRAILLE LITERACY CRISIS, THE TECHNOLOGY ENABLES THE BLIND TO BE GIVEN THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS THEIR SIGHTED PEERS, INCLUDING BETTER CHANCES AT GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, OBTAINING EMPLOYMENT, AND HAVING HIGH INDEPENDENCE LEVELS. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT IS IN DEVELOPMENT OF A WEARABLE, COMPUTER VISION-BASED, REAL-TIME BRAILLE-TO-SPEECH LEARNING DEVICE.

HOWEVER, CURRENT PRODUCTION OF ORDINARY PORTLAND CEMENT (OPC)-BASED CONCRETE CONTRIBUTES TO THREE MAIN CHALLENGES THAT OUR SOCIETY IS FACING TODAY: CLIMATE CHANGE, RESOURCE DEPLETION, AND SOLID WASTE. THIS CONVERGENCE RESEARCH WILL ESTABLISH A PATHWAY TO ADDRESS ALL THESE CHALLENGES BY LEVERAGING THE SYNERGY OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY PRINCIPLES AND A REVOLUTIONARY MANUFACTURING METHOD OF CONCRETE WHICH CONVERTS CONCRETE INTO ONE OF THE LARGEST SINKS FOR CO2. THROUGH A BIOMOLECULE-REGULATED CARBONATION (BIOCARB) TECHNOLOGY, THIS NEW MANUFACTURING METHOD TRANSFORMS CEMENT SLURRY INTO AN EFFECTIVE CO2 ABSORBENT, WHICH CAN ABSORB AND PERMANENTLY STORE 25 TO 50 TIMES MORE CO2 IN FRESH CONCRETE THAN EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF THE PRODUCED CONCRETE CAN BE DRASTICALLY INCREASED BY IN-SITU PRODUCED NANOPARTICLES. SIMILARLY, CALCIUM-RICH INDUSTRIAL WASTES ? SUCH AS RECYCLED CONCRETE FINES, STEEL SLAG, AND COAL ASHES ? CAN BE CONVERTED INTO CARBON-NEGATIVE SUPPLEMENTARY CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS, WHICH CAN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OPC NEEDED FOR CONCRETE PRODUCTION. IN ADDITION, THE FUNCTIONAL BIOMOLECULES USED IN BIOCARB WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM AGRICULTURAL WASTE, WHICH PROVIDES A NEW SOLUTION TO DECARBONIZE CHEMICAL ADMIXTURES USED IN CONCRETE. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS PROJECT CAN UNLOCK THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF CONCRETE FOR PERMANENT STORAGE OF CO2 AS CARBONATE MINERALS AND DECARBONIZE ALL INGREDIENTS OF CONCRETE. AS A RESULT, THE CO2 FOOTPRINT OF CONCRETE WILL POTENTIALLY BE REDUCED BY MORE THAN 50%. IF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS DEPLOYED AT FULL SCALE, OVER 2 BILLION METRIC TONS OF CO2 CAN BE REDUCED PER YEAR GLOBALLY, AND MORE THAN 3 BILLION METRIC TONS OF SOLID WASTES CAN BE CONVERTED INTO USEFUL CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS AND AGGREGATE EVERY YEAR AND AVOIDING EXTRACTION OF THE SAME AMOUNTS OF NATURAL RESOURCES. CONCRETE CAN SERVE AS A CO2 SINK THROUGH MINERALIZATION PROCESSES, IN WHICH CO2 REACT WITH CALCIUM-RICH MINERALS IN CONCRETE TO PRODUCE CACO3 AND PERMANENTLY STORE CO2. HOWEVER, KEY CHALLENGES INCLUDING DIFFUSION BARRIERS AND MARGINAL STRENGTH IMPROVEMENT IMPEDE EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES TO REACH FULL POTENTIAL OF CONCRETE FOR CO2 SEQUESTRATION. TO FULLY UNLOCK THIS POTENTIAL, WE PROPOSE A BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY, BIOCARB, TO MAXIMIZE CO2 UPTAKE WHILE N-SITU PRODUCE NANOSCALE PERFORMANCE ENHANCERS BEFORE CONCRETE HARDENS. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY USING A BIOMOLECULE AS SMALL-DOSE ADDITIVE, WHICH REGULATES THE CARBONATION PROCESS OF CALCIUM-RICH MINERALS THROUGH: I) CHELATING WITH CALCIUM TO FACILITATE THE CARBONATION OF THE MINERALS, II) CONTROLLING THE CRYSTAL NUCLEATION, ORIENTATION, SIZE, AND POLYMORPH OF CALCIUM CARBONATE, AND III) ENABLING UNIFORM DISPERSION OF THE PRODUCED CACO3 NANO- AND MICRO-PARTICLES. AS A RESULT, MUCH MORE CO2 CAN BE ABSORBED BY CONCRETE DIRECTLY WITHOUT COMPROMISING PERFORMANCE. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE METASTABLE CACO3 PRODUCED THROUGH BIOCARB CAN REACT WITH THE CEMENT TO FORM NEW MINERALS OR DISSOLVE AND RE-PRECIPITATE TO FUNCTION AS A BINDING PHASE IN CONCRETE. AS A RESULT, A NOVEL CALCIUM SILICATE HYDRATE-CACO3 HYBRID BINDER CAN FORM IN THE CONCRETE, LEADING TO IMPROVED MECHANICAL STRENGTH, VOLUMETRIC STABILITY, AND DURABILITY. SIMILARLY, THIS PROCESS CAN BE USED TO PROCESS OTHER CALCIUM-RICH SOLID WASTES AND CONVERT THEM INTO CARBON-NEGATIVE SUPPLEMENTARY CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS AND AGGREGATE FOR MAXIMAL SUBSTITUTION OF CEMENT AND NATURALLY EXTRACTED AGGREGATE, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IMPLIES AN EVEN BIGGER POTENTIAL FOR DECARBONIZATION. A CONVERGENT RESEARCH APPROACH IS EMPLOYED IN THIS PROJECT TO TRANSIT BIOCARB INTO PRACTICAL USE, BY FUSING MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES ?

DISABILITIES PRESENT MAJOR BARRIERS TO ENTERING THE LABOR FORCE; APPROXIMATELY 80% OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES (PWDS) WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE 2021 LABOR FORCE. MEANWHILE, PROGRAMMING JOBS CONTINUE TO GROW EXPLOSIVELY BUT ARE LARGELY INACCESSIBLE TO PWDS. STANDARD PROGRAMMING INTERFACES?-SCREENS, KEYBOARDS, MICE?-ARE DIFFICULT TO OPERATE FOR MANY PWDS WITH PHYSICAL CHALLENGES. THIS PROJECT SUPPORTS INDIVIDUALS WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES THAT RESULT IN BARRIERS TO LEARNING AND ENGAGING IN PROGRAMMING, BLOCKING ACCESS TO THE WIDELY AVAILABLE, LUCRATIVE, AND UPWARDLY MOBILE TECHNOLOGY WORKFORCE. THE WORK WILL DEVELOP A MEANS OF AMELIORATING NEGATIVE LABOR OUTCOMES FACED BY PWDS BY DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING PROTOTYPES OF MULTIMODAL INTERFACES (E.G., SPEECH, EYE TRACKING, PEDALS) THAT ENABLE PWDS TO LEARN, PRACTICE, AND UTILIZE PROGRAMMING SKILLS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO DEVELOP A PATH FOR PWDS TO TRAIN FOR?AND ENTER?THE PROGRAMMING WORKFORCE, THEREBY BRIDGING THE CAREER GAP THAT BLOCKS MOST PWDS FROM SUCH CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. IMPACTS OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE: 1) INCREASED REPRESENTATION OF PWDS IN STEM JOBS, 2) INCREASED ECONOMIC AND PERSONAL WELL-BEING FOR PWDS, 3) IMPROVED ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS OF THE U.S., AND 4) ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. ENABLING PWDS ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING SKILLS AND EMPLOYMENT WILL PRODUCE AN INFLUX OF PWDS IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR, INCREASE DIVERSITY IN STEM, AND LEAD TO SUSTAINED EMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING FOR PWDS. SINCE PROGRAMMING JOBS CAN OFTEN BE DONE REMOTELY, THIS WORK WILL REMOVE TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS FOR PWDS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO USE WHEELCHAIRS. AS JOB STABILITY IS A PRIMARY CONCERN FOR MANY PWDS, THIS WILL LEAD TO SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE. FURTHERMORE, INCREASING THE WORKFORCE OF PEOPLE WHO CAN PROGRAM WILL IMPROVE US ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS WHILE INCREASING THE DIVERSITY OF THE WORKFORCE. FINALLY, DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE, USER-FRIENDLY, AND SUSTAINABLE WAYS OF INTERFACING WITH COMPUTERS WILL ALSO BE USEFUL IN K-12 AND IN RESEARCH NATIONWIDE. IT WILL ALLOW FOR EARLY PROGRAMMING EDUCATION AND COMPUTER USE IN K-12 SETTINGS FOR CHILDREN WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES, AND FOR AGING SENIORS WHO EXPERIENCE LOSS OF DEXTERITY AND FINE MOTOR CONTROL. THIS PROJECT WILL PRODUCE MULTIPLE TECHNICAL ADVANCES AND CONTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING: 1) A LARGE CORPUS OF INSIGHTS ABOUT THE RELEVANT PWD SUBPOPULATION NEEDS FOR ENGAGING IN LEARNING AND PRACTICING WORKFORCE-READY PROGRAMMING; 2) CO-DESIGNED PERSONALIZABLE PROTOTYPE INTERFACES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE AFFORDABLE, ACCESSIBLE, AND WORK ACROSS PLATFORMS; 3) MACHINE LEARNING MODELS THAT WILL ENABLE PERSONALIZATION OF THE DEVELOPED TOOLS TO MEET INDIVIDUAL USER NEEDS; AND 4) AN INCLUSIVE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK INFORMED BY THE ADVISORY BOARD AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS DURING THE CO-DESIGN SESSIONS. THIS WORK COMBINES INPUT DEVICES BEYOND KEYBOARDS AND MICE TO CREATE AN OFF-THE-SHELF, PERSONALIZABLE, MULTIMODAL INPUT INTERFACE FOR TEACHING AND ENABLING WORKFORCE-READY PROGRAMMING FOR AT LEAST ONE IDENTIFIED SUBPOPULATION OF USERS WITH SIMILAR PHYSICAL ABILITIES. THE PROTOTYPES EXPLORE COMBINATIONS OF INPUT MODALITIES PROCESSED BY MULTIMODAL, PERSONALIZED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO TRANSLATE INPUTS TO OUTPUT KEYSTROKES AND CURSOR ACTIVITY. PROTOTYPES WILL LEVERAGE LARGE-SCALE PRETRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS TO GUIDE THE TRANSLATION OF USER INPUT TO CODE OUTPUT AND WILL USE A SINGLE INPUT MODALITY WITH A FOCUSED OUTPUT SPACE (I.E., WRITING PYTHON FUNCTIONS, OPERATORS, AND PROGRAM-SPECIFIC VARIABLES); MULTIPLE PROTOTYPES WILL BE CREATED AND TESTED WITH THE RELEVANT PWD POPULATIONS. THE CORPUS OF DATA FROM EACH MODALITY WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY USER SETS WITH SIMILAR ABILITIES THROUGH CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES, WHILE A CENTRALIZED LEARNING BACKBONE CAN BE FINE-TUNED PER USER POPULATION USING LOW-PARAMETER FINE-TUNING APPROACHES SUCH AS TRANSFORMER-BASED ADAPTERS.

THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED THESE ISSUES. ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL STEPS IN ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY IS TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RESOURCES REQUIRED AND THE CHALLENGES FACED IN PROCUREMENT, DISTRIBUTION, ACCESS, AND UTILIZATION OF FOOD RESOURCES IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ON THE DEMAND SIDE, STAKEHOLDERS MUST IDENTIFY THE NUTRITIONAL NEEDS, CULTURAL PREFERENCES, AND FOOD PREPARATION EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES OF FOOD-INSECURE HOUSEHOLDS. IF AN INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT KNOW WHAT A PARTICULAR FOOD IS NOR HOW TO PREPARE IT, IT WILL GO TO WASTE, AND THE EFFORTS OF THE FOOD CHARITY ECOSYSTEM WILL FAIL. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, STAKEHOLDERS MUST STREAMLINE LOGISTICS AND IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION TO OPTIMIZE THE SUPPLY CHAIN (UPSTREAM PROCUREMENT AND DOWNSTREAM DISTRIBUTION) TO MINIMIZE INEFFICIENCIES AND COORDINATE THE EFFORTS OF VARIOUS FOOD CHARITIES. THROUGH A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN APPROACH, THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER CIVIC COLLABORATORS WITH UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS TO DEVELOP AND BUILD A LOCALLY-ORIENTED FOOD CHARITY ECOSYSTEM BASED ON DATA-DRIVEN SMART TECHNOLOGIES IN THE GREATER HOUSTON REGION. OUR SOCIO-TECHNICAL APPROACH ADDRESSES FOUR OVERALL RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) HOW CAN WE REDEFINE, MODEL, AND PREDICT FOOD DESERTS? (2) HOW CAN WE MINIMIZE FOOD WASTE? (3) HOW CAN WE IMPACT NUTRITION LITERACY? (4) HOW CAN WE MEASURE THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF HAVING ACCESS TO CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE NUTRITIOUS FOOD? THESE QUESTIONS DRIVE THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: (I) ASSESS, MODEL, AND PREDICT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD; (II) ANALYZE COMMUNITIES TO FIND UNTAPPED STRENGTHS IN PREPARING CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE RECIPES AND TRANSFER THIS KNOWLEDGE TO LIKE-MINDED COMMUNITY MEMBERS, (III) BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FOOD PANTRIES TO PROVIDE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FOOD THEY HAVE IN STOCK AND RECIPES/FOOD PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS, (IV) CREATE A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED MARKETPLACE FOR FOOD DONATIONS, (V) DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO DISSEMINATE IT, AND (VI) MEASURE THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF HAVING ACCESS TO CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE NUTRITIOUS FOOD.

THE NEED FOR RESILIENT LOCAL FOOD SUPPLY HAS REFOCUSED EFFORTS ON DOMESTIC SOURCING OF FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES. YET, LOGISTICAL AND MARKET KNOWLEDGE BARRIERS LIMIT THE VIABILITY OF PRODUCTIVE LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS. THE CONVERGENCE OF MULTIPLE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH FIELDS AND MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING CAN IMPROVE SUPPLY AND DEMAND EFFICIENCIES BY EXTENDING SMALL FARMERS? ACCESS TO MARKET INSIGHTS. THIS PROJECT WILL EMPOWER REGIONAL FOOD PRODUCERS TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE SPECIALTY CROP ASSORTMENT AND FOOD ANIMALS ON THEIR FARMS IN COMPARISON TO MARKET DEMAND FOR INSTITUTIONAL SALES (E.G., RETAILERS, FOOD HUBS, DISTRIBUTORS, GROCERS, RESTAURANTS, HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS OR COLLEGES). THE END-PLATFORM?S DATA-DRIVEN MARKET AND FINANCIAL INSIGHTS WILL ENHANCE REGIONAL FOOD PRODUCERS? ABILITIES TO OBTAIN PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS WITH INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS, SUPPORTING LOCAL FARMS TO BRING THEIR PRODUCTS TO STORE SHELVES, RESTAURANT TABLES, AND CAFETERIAS. ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF REGIONAL FOOD SYSTEMS WILL HAVE BROAD SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ECONOMIC LIVELIHOODS OF SMALL FARMERS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES, AND FOR THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS LOCAL FOOD THAT WILL SUPPORT METABOLIC HEALTH, PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FURTHERMORE, ENHANCED KNOWLEDGE OF SALES CHANNELS WILL REDUCE FOOD LOSSES AND ENHANCE CROP DIVERSITY, THUS CREATING INCOME STREAMS FOR FARMERS PRACTICING CLIMATE-FRIENDLY REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURAL TECHNIQUES SUCH AS MIXED FARMING AND CROP DIVERSIFICATION. ULTIMATELY, THIS PROJECT ADVANCES THE HEALTH AND PROSPERITY OF THE UNITED STATES? POPULATION, AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, THROUGH ITS FOCUS ON FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY. THIS PROJECT ASSESSES USER NEEDS TO DESIGN A SCALABLE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT PROVIDES MARKET INSIGHTS TO SMALL FARMERS. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH OBJECTIVES ARE: (A) TO UNDERSTAND THE KNOWLEDGE BARRIERS THAT SMALL FARMERS EXPERIENCE TO SELL TO INSTITUTIONAL MARKETS; AND (B) TO CONVERGE USE-INSPIRED RESEARCH OF MULTIPLE SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES AND NOVEL DATA-DRIVEN TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN FOR A SOFTWARE PLATFORM THAT WOULD SUPPORT SMALL FARMERS TO ACCESS THE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION. THE RESEARCH METHODS INCLUDE: (A) USER DISCOVERY WITH SMALL FARMERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE; (B) MARKET ANALYSIS; (C) DATA COLLECTION THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DATA FEEDS FOR COMPUTATIONAL MODELS IN THE PLATFORM. DATA COLLECTION INCLUDES: (I) INVENTORY ASSESSMENTS AND INTERVIEWS WITH INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS IN THE UNDERSERVED PILOT REGIONS TO IDENTIFY LOCAL DEMAND FOR FOOD PRODUCTS; (II) PRODUCT-LEVEL DATA COLLECTED ON-FARM VIA ROBOTICS, REMOTE SENSING, SATELLITE DATA OR DRONE, INCLUDING BOTH EXISTING DATASETS AND DATA COLLECTED FROM GROWERS; (III) ASSESSMENT OF LOW-COST VALIDATED ON-FARM PREVENTATIVE CONTROLS AND DETECTION OF MICROBIAL RISK FOR ANALYSIS OF FOOD SAFETY ECONOMIC RISK MODELS TO SUPPORT PRODUCTION DECISIONS. CENTRAL TO THE TRANSLATION OF RESEARCH DISCOVERY TO MARKET IMPACT, THIS PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY THE BARRIERS THAT SMALL FARMERS EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND INSTITUTIONAL MARKET DEMAND AND SELL TO INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS. BY IDENTIFYING WHERE GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPLY AND DEMAND INEFFICIENCIES, IT WILL ALSO EXTEND UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA ACROSS SCIENTIFIC FIELDS THAT COULD BE INTEGRATED TO INFORM BUSINESS DECISIONS, LEVERAGING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML) TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS COMPUTER VISION, TO PRICE FARM PRODUCTS AND CREATE PREDICTIVE MODELS TO ANTICIPATE FUTURE FOOD DEMAND AND PRICING.

A MAJOR BARRIER TO COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND EMPLOYMENT FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IS THE LACK OF ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION. OF THE NEARLY 25% OF THE ADULT POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES LIVING WITH A DISABILITY, ROUGHLY 60% ARE OF PRIME WORKING AGE. THUS, THESE BARRIERS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE ECONOMY AND IMPORTANTLY LIMIT UPWARD SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE LACK OF ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION IS THAT PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE DIFFERENT TRAVEL PATTERNS COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION. FOR INSTANCE, THEY TEND TO MAKE FEWER TRIPS, ARE PRONE TO UTILIZING SLOWER MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION, TRAVEL SHORTER DISTANCES AND RELY MORE UPON PUBLIC TRANSIT. DESPITE DECADES OF CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION FOR AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES, ACCESS TO SAFE AND RELIABLE ROUTES TO PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT ARE HAMPERED BY INACCESSIBLE AND POOR-QUALITY SIDEWALKS, PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY, BUS STOPS AND GENERAL CONNECTIVITY. IMPROVING INTEGRATION OF THESE SYSTEMS ACROSS RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES REQUIRES RELIABLE DATA ? BUT THESE DATA ARE EXPENSIVE TO CREATE AND OFTEN UNAVAILABLE. THE LACK OF DATA INEVITABLY HAMPERS THE ABILITY FOR ADVOCACY GROUPS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO UNDERSTAND, TRANSPARENTLY DISCUSS, AND MAKE INFORMED PLANNING DECISIONS THAT IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION, AND THUS, EMPLOYMENT ACCESS. THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE A TECHNIQUE TO RAPIDLY GENERATE DATA ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING A MORE INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES. THIS PROJECT BUILDS ON THE CONVERGENCE OF TWO DISTINCT AND ACTIVE PROJECTS SPONSORED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (#2125087) AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DISABILITY, INDEPENDENT LIVING AND REHABILITATION RESEARCH (#90DPCP0004). THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO: 1) DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE TO AUTOMATE THE DELINEATION AND AFFORDANCE ASSESSMENT OF BUS STOPS TO INTEGRATE WITH EXISTING EFFORTS ON SIDEWALK QUALITY AUTOMATION, AND 2) EXPLORE THE ROLE THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND FIRST/LAST MILE PLAY ON COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION TO AND FROM PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSEHOLDS. THIS WORK IS INTENDED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION AND COMPUTER VISION, PARTICULARLY AT THE INTERSECTION WITH URBAN PLANNING AND DISABILITIES STUDIES. WE ALSO WORK TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES OF MACHINE LEARNING BIAS TOWARD MINORITIES BY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES TO IMPROVE EMPIRICAL COMPUTATIONAL MODELS. TECHNICAL TEAM MEMBERS WILL INTERACT WITH DISABILITY EXPERTS AND DESIGNERS ON THE TEAM TO BRIDGE DISCIPLINARY GAPS THAT HAMPER EFFORTS TO TRANSLATE EXPERIENTIAL QUALITATIVE INFORMATION (ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING) INTO COMPUTATIONAL MODELS THAT MAKE INTERPRETATIONS AND EVALUATIONS ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL RESULT IN OPEN-SOURCE ACCESSIBILITY ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION TOOLS ABOUT FIRST/LAST MILE AND THE QUALITY OF SIDEWALKS, BUS STOPS AND ROADWAYS.

THE SITUATION WILL ONLY WORSEN, LEADING TO MORE SEVERE AND FREQUENT DROUGHTS FOLLOWED BY FLOODING, DECREASING ARABLE LAND, AND INCREASING FOOD INSECURITY. A MORE EFFICIENT IRRIGATION SYSTEM IS NEEDED, ESPECIALLY FOR WATER-INTENSIVE CROPS, SUCH AS SOYBEANS, WHEAT, AND SUGARCANE. HYDROGELS ADDED TO SOIL REDUCE IRRIGATION FREQUENCY BY ABSORBING AND RETAINING WATER AND RELEASING IT WHEN THE SOIL DRIES. THEY IMPROVE THE HYDRO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL, SUCH AS POROSITY, AND THEY CAN REDUCE EROSION AND RUNOFF AND THEREBY MITIGATE THE EFFECT OF FLOODING. HYDROGELS FUNCTION AS SMALL WATER CONTAINERS IN THE GROUND WITH OSMOTIC MEMBRANES THAT INCREASE MICROBIAL ACTIVITY, GROWTH, AND PERFORMANCE RATE. CURRENTLY, MOST OF THE HYDROGELS ON THE MARKET ARE SYNTHETIC POLYACRYLATES AND POLYACRYLAMIDES, WHICH ARE PETROLEUM-BASED MATERIALS AND NOT ECOLOGICALLY FRIENDLY FOR LARGE-SCALE AGRICULTURE. SOME SEMISYNTHETIC STARCH-BASED POLYMERS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, A BETTER ALTERNATIVE IS POSSIBLE. ALGINATE-BASED HYDROGELS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFICIENT IN CONTROLLING SOIL MOISTURE FOR PLANT GROWTH. IN THIS PROJECT, WE INTRODUCE THE ECOLOGICALLY FRIENDLY WATER CONTAINER AQUA SAC, AN ALGINATE-BASED HYDROGEL THAT CAN BE PRODUCED IN VARIOUS PATTERNS SUCH AS SHEETS OR MESHES. OSMOTIC MEMBRANES CAN BE FORMED BY BINDING CALCIUM AT THE SURFACE, MAKING THEM SIMILAR IN FUNCTION TO SYNTHETIC HYDROGELS. MOREOVER, ADDING ALGINATE HYDROGELS TO SOIL CAN STIMULATE MICROBIAL ACTIVITY, WHICH GENERATES MICROBIAL BIOMASS AND DIVERSITY, AND THE BIODEGRADATION OF ALGINATE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SOIL HEALTH AND, IN TURN, LEADS TO INCREASED CROP PRODUCTION. ALGINATE IS EXTRACTED FROM SEAWEEDS, SUCH AS KELP, WHICH CAN BE SUSTAINABLY FARMED WHILE PROVIDING A SUITE OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. SEAWEEDS ARE A ZERO-INPUT CROP THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE USE OF FERTILIZERS, PESTICIDES, OR FRESH WATER. RATHER, SEAWEEDS EXTRACT EXCESS NUTRIENTS FROM THE SURROUNDING WATERS, INCLUDING DISSOLVED NITROGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE, WHICH HELPS TO COMBAT EUTROPHICATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THUS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF AQUA SAC WILL BENEFIT AGRICULTURE AND SOIL HEALTH ON LAND AND THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT BY HELPING TO INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR AQUACULTURED SEAWEEDS. THIS COLLABORATIVE PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND AND DEVELOP THE INDUSTRIALIZATION STEPS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AQUA SAC AT A COMMERCIAL SCALE. THE TECHNIQUE THAT WAS DEVELOPED ALLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF ALGINATE HYDROGEL IN ROLLS THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED TO THE FIELD IN THE FORM OF SHEETS OR MESHES OF VARIOUS PATTERNS THAT CAN BE USED AS AN ADDITIVE MATERIAL FOR APPLICATIONS RANGING FROM SOIL HYDRATION TO FOOD PRESERVATION. THE SCALING FROM A LABORATORY TO AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF SEAWEED FARMING, ALGINATE EXTRACTION, HYDROGEL OPTIMIZATION, AND FIELD PERFORMANCE. INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THESE STEPS WILL GIVE US THE ELEMENTS NECESSARY TO CREATE A BUSINESS MODEL AND SEEK INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS FOR THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF AQUA SAC ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL SEEK TO: 1) IDENTIFY SEAWEED SPECIES AND GROWING REGIONS THAT MAXIMIZE DOMESTIC ALGINATE PRODUCTION AND QUALITY; 2) REFINE METHODS OF ALGINATE EXTRACTION AND HYDROGEL PRODUCTION TO MINIMIZE WASTE PRODUCTION, 3) OPTIMIZE THE HYDROGEL MEMBRANE FOR WATER ABSORPTION AND RETENTION, AND 4) CONDUCT FIELD TESTS TO UNDERSTAND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HYDROGEL UNDER ACTUAL AGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS. ALL STEPS WILL BE DEVELOPED WITHIN A CIRCULAR ECONOMY MODEL TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THE PROJECT WILL BE DOCUMENTED BY PHOTO AND FILMED FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION.

THE FIRST STEP TO ACHIEVE THIS, AND THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS CONVERGENCE ACCELERATOR PHASE 1 WORK IS TO DEVELOP A SHARED UNDERSTANDING ACROSS CITIZENS FROM DIVERSE SECTORS AND DISCIPLINES ABOUT HOW FOOD AND CLIMATE SYSTEMS HAVE CONVERGED IN THE ARCHIPELAGO OF PUERTO RICO (PR), ALLOWING FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND TESTING OF STRATEGIES TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR NUTRITIOUS AND CLIMATE-FRIENDLY FOODS AMONG FOOD INSECURE INDIVIDUALS. THIS WORK BUILDS ON EXISTING COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL DIGITAL MODELS IN PR, A HIGHLY FOOD INSECURE AND CLIMATE-VULNERABLE REGION, TO IDENTIFY HOW TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR NUTRITIOUS AND CLIMATE-FRIENDLY FOODS AMONG FOOD INSECURE INDIVIDUALS AND TO GENERATE REAL-TIME USER-LEVEL DATA THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO DATA SYSTEMS DYNAMIC COMPUTATIONAL MODEL TO INFORM CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT AND POLICY ACTION. THIS IS THE FIRST COLLABORATION OF ITS KIND TO USE DATA GENERATED FROM FOOD INSECURE DIGITAL APP USERS IN REAL TIME TO: 1) MODEL HOW THE FOOD AND CLIMATE SYSTEMS HAVE CONVERGED AND AFFECT NUTRITION SECURITY AND, 2) PROMOTE NUTRITIOUS, CLIMATE-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS IN A HIGHLY FOOD INSECURE REGION OF THE US. THE PROPOSED WORK BROADENS PARTICIPATION FROM UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, WILL CONTRIBUTE TO BETTER ALIGNMENT BETWEEN FOOD PRODUCERS AND LOW-INCOME CONSUMERS, AND BRINGS TOGETHER LOCALLY GENERATED INNOVATIONS ACROSS SECTORS TO STIMULATE NEW SOLUTIONS TO THE CONVERGENCE PROBLEM. THIS WORK WILL SET THE FOUNDATION AND NEEDED DATA TO EVENTUALLY DEVELOP A USER-FRIENDLY DASHBOARD TO TEST (VIA MATHEMATICAL SIMULATION) HOW VARIOUS FOOD SECURITY AND CLIMATE HEALTH INITIATIVES AND POLICIES COULD IMPACT NUTRITION SECURITY IN PR AND ELSEWHERE. PHASE 1 HAS TWO SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1: TO DEVELOP A SHARED UNDERSTANDING ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS ABOUT THE SYSTEM DYNAMICS THAT DRIVE NUTRITION INSECURITY AND CLIMATE HEALTH IN PR, THIS WORK WILL EMPLOY COMMUNITY-BASED SYSTEM DYNAMICS PARTICIPATORY METHODS (E.G., GROUP MODEL BUILDING). THE DELIVERABLE FOR AIM 1 IS A QUALITATIVE CAUSAL LOOP DIAGRAM AND LEVERS THAT CAN INFORM CONTEXT-APPROPRIATE VIABLE SOLUTIONS TO ACHIEVE NUTRITIONAL SECURITY AND CLIMATE HEALTH IN PR. AIM 2: BUILDING ON AN EXISTING AND COMMERCIALLY-VIABLE DIGITAL APPLICATION IN PR AND FROM THE CAUSAL LOOP DIAGRAM (AIM 1), AIM 2 WILL USE HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY HOW THE DIGITAL APPLICATION CAN EXPAND ITS REACH TO ADDRESS NUTRITION AND CLIMATE HEALTH AMONG FOOD INSECURE CITIZENS. THEN A RANDOMIZED DESIGN WILL BE USED TO TEST VARIOUS DIGITAL STRATEGIES TO ?NUDGE? THE SELECTION OF CLIMATE AND NUTRITION-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS AMONG 600 FOOD INSECURE APP USERS THROUGHOUT PR (RECRUITED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS STUDY). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS A SCORE FOR NUTRITION AND CLIMATE-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS IN USERS? SHOPPING CARTS. THE DIGITAL APP CAPTURES REAL-TIME DATA ABOUT CONSUMERS? FOOD SHOPPING DECISIONS AND WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE FOOD SECURITY, FOOD LITERACY (I.E., CLIMATE AND NUTRITION SECURITY PUBLIC AWARENESS), AND AGGREGATED TO LOCAL FOOD PRODUCER DATA (I.E., AGRICULTURAL MEASURES, PRODUCTIVITY, SALES). PHASE 1 DELIVERABLES INCLUDE: 1) A CAUSAL LOOP DIAGRAM WITH FEEDBACK LOOPS AND POTENTIALLY VIABLE SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE DISSEMINATED. IT WILL BE USED TO STRUCTURE A QUANTITATIVE MODEL THAT CAN BE CALIBRATED WITH PHASE1 (AIM 1) DATA, AND WITH NEW DATA TO BE COLLECTED IN PHASE 2; AND 2) RANKING AND REFINEMENT OF CONTEXT-APPROPRIATE USER-INSPIRED STRATEGIES THAT HOLD PROMISE FOR FURTHER TESTING IN A POTENTIALLY COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PROTOTYPE IN PHASE 2.

A HEALTHY CROP CROPPING SYSTEMS (CCS) IS VITAL FOR ACHIEVING FOOD AND NUTRIENT SECURITY OF THE U.S. AND THE WORLD AND ENHANCING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF U.S. AGRICULTURE IN THE WORLD MARKET. YET, CROP PRODUCTION CREATES LARGE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT. THE USDA AGRICULTURAL INNOVATION AGENDA CALLS FOR INCREASING U.S. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION BY 40% WHILE CUTTING ITS ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT IN HALF BY 2050. SOUND CROP MANAGEMENT DECISION-MAKING IS A KEY IN REACHING THIS AMBITIOUS GOAL. TRADITIONALLY, CROP MANAGEMENT DECISIONS ARE MADE BY INDIVIDUALS BASED ON THEIR EMPIRICAL JUDGMENT, WHICH IS OFTEN SUBJECTIVE AND FAR FROM OPTIMAL. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SCIENCE-BASED, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH FOR CROP MANAGEMENT DECISION-MAKING RELIES ON TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION ON CURRENT AND PREDICTED FUTURE CONDITIONS OF CROP, SOIL, WEATHER, AND MARKET TO MAKE OPTIMAL DECISIONS. STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH CAN OVERCOME THE INHERENT DEFICIENCIES IN THE EMPIRICAL APPROACH AND BRING SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS A CHALLENGE FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO UTILIZE THE DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH BECAUSE THEY DON?T HAVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO THE TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION AND LACK FACILITIES OR KNOWLEDGE TO PROCESS THE INFORMATION. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE SUCH TIMELY INFORMATION AND DECISION SUPPORT TO STAKEHOLDERS FOR ENABLING THE DATA-DRIVEN OPTIMAL DECISION-MAKING NATIONWIDE AT FIELD SCALES BY DEVELOPING THE CROPSMART DIGITAL TWIN (CSDT).

THE FASHION INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS AND WATER CONTAMINATION, AND THE INDUSTRY YIELDS MORE THAN 100 MILLION TONS OF TEXTILE WASTE EACH YEAR. THE RECYCLED TEXTILE AND APPAREL MANUFACTURING ECOSYSTEMS (RETAME) PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS FROM ENGINEERING, DESIGN, AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, INDUSTRY PARTNERS, AND THE NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, GOODWILL INDUSTRIES, TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE RECYCLED MATERIALS MODEL FOR THE TEXTILE AND APPAREL INDUSTRY. BY CONVERTING POST-CONSUMER FASHION WASTE INTO NEW PRODUCTS, RETAME KEEPS CLOTHING OUT OF LANDFILLS, GENERATES REVENUE FROM EXISTING WASTE STREAMS, AND REDUCES THE NEED FOR VIRGIN MATERIALS. THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF 1) NOVEL MECHANICAL RECYCLING TECHNOLOGIES, 2) PRODUCT PROTOTYPES MADE FROM RECYCLED FIBERS AND TEXTILE PIECES, AND 3) EDUCATIONAL AND SKILLS TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR JOB SEEKERS AND STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED AND DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. THE PROJECT WILL YIELD A MODEL RECYCLING ECOSYSTEM TO GROW THE DELAWARE VALLEY REGIONAL ECONOMY AND IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR CLOTHING. TEAM MEMBERS WILL DOCUMENT AND EVALUATE THE PROJECT AT EVERY STAGE TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE MODEL IN OTHER REGIONS. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF RETAME IS TO GATHER PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR A SUSTAINABLE RECYCLED MATERIALS MODEL FOR THE TEXTILE AND APPAREL INDUSTRY THAT CAN BE REPLICATED IN REGIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD. RETAME ACCOMPLISHES THIS GOAL BY LEVERAGING REGIONAL EXPERTISE AND LOCALLY AVAILABLE WASTE MATERIALS.

THIS NUMBER EXCEEDS THAT OF OTHER SECTORS OF CONCERN, SUCH AS AVIATION AND SHIPPING, AND IS EXPECTED TO GROW ANOTHER 30% BY 2030. MATERIALS DERIVED FROM CRUDE OIL AND METHANE ACCOUNT FOR AROUND TWO-THIRDS OF ALL TEXTILES. THESE SYNTHETIC TEXTILES HAVE DRIVEN THE GROWTH OF CHEAP, SHORT-LIVED CLOTHING ASSOCIATED WITH THE ?FAST FASHION?, FUELING EVEN HIGHER CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS. THIS FAST FASHION BUSINESS MODEL ACCELERATES A LINEAR TAKE-MAKE-WASTE PLASTICS ECONOMY, WHERE VIRGIN FEEDSTOCK IS PREDOMINANTLY USED, AND CLOTHING ARE ONLY WORN A HANDFUL OF TIMES BEFORE BEING LANDFILLED OR INCINERATED. BECAUSE MOST SYNTHETIC TEXTILES ARE NOT BIODEGRADABLE, INCREASE OF PLASTIC POLLUTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS AN INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE FASHION INDUSTRY TODAY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXPLORE THE FABRICATION OF FOSSIL-FREE BIODEGRADABLE TEXTILES AND FIBERS THAT EXHIBIT PERFORMANCE ATTRIBUTES SUITABLE FOR REPLACING CONVENTIONAL MATERIALS IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY. SUCH CONVENTIONAL MATERIALS INCLUDE SYNTHETIC FIBERS, SUCH AS POLYESTERS, POLYURETHANES, AND NYLONS, AS WELL AS NON-SUSTAINABLE NATURAL MATERIALS, SUCH AS LEATHER. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP MANUFACTURING PROCESSES FOR FABRICATING RENEWABLE FOSSIL-FREE YARNS, DYES, AND LEATHER-LIKE FABRICS THAT COMBINE FUNGI/PLANT-DERIVED BIOMASS WITH ARTIFICIAL SILK PROTEIN FOR ENHANCED PERFORMANCE IN CONSUMER TEXTILE APPLICATIONS.

THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO DEVELOP OUTREACH PROGRAMS FOR K-12 STUDENTS REGARDING SUSTAINABLE FASHION. MOST BIOMATERIALS DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO DATE PRIMARILY FOCUS ON A SINGLE BIOPOLYMER CLASS. NATURE, HOWEVER, EXTENSIVELY LEVERAGES THE SYNERGY OF DIFFERENT BIOMOLECULAR CLASSES TO YIELD MATERIALS THAT EXHIBIT ALMOST PARADOXICAL PROPERTIES (E.G. STIFF YET TOUGH, STRONG YET EXTENSIBLE). THIS PROJECT WILL SYNTHESIZE 100% FOSSIL-FREE BIOMATERIALS THAT FEATURE DIVERSE CLASSES OF BIOMACROMOLECULES. RESEARCH EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCING THE PROPERTIES OF A CELLULOSIC (BAST FIBER) OR CHITINACEOUS (MYCELIUM) BASE MATERIAL, WHICH ARE STRONG AND STIFF BUT LACK SUFFICIENT TOUGHNESS AND DURABILITY, WITH RECOMBINANTLY ENGINEERED SILK FIBROIN, WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO MATERIAL ROBUSTNESS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO MANUFACTURE CHROMOPROTEIN DYES AS A BIOBASED ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL TEXTILE DYES.

ONE DRAMATIC CORRELATE OF VISION LOSS IS UNEMPLOYMENT, WITH RATES AS HIGH AS 81% IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. EMPLOYMENT DISPARITIES STEM, AT LEAST IN LARGE PART, FROM DIFFICULTIES WITH TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM WORK AND WAYFINDING WITHIN THE WORKPLACE ITSELF. THIS PROJECT TAKES A FUNDAMENTAL STEP IN ADDRESSING THE EMPLOYMENT CHALLENGES OF PBLV THROUGH A RECENTLY DEVELOPED, POWERFUL ASSISTIVE-NAVIGATION PLATFORM, THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED SMART SERVICE SYSTEM FOR SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ONBOARD NAVIGATION (VIS4ION). VIS4ION IS A DISCREET, INSTRUMENTED BACKPACK WITH AN ARRAY OF MINIATURIZED SENSORS INTEGRATED INTO BACKSTRAPS THAT CONNECT TO AN EMBEDDED SYSTEM FOR COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS. REAL-TIME FEEDBACK IS PROVIDED THROUGH A BINAURAL BONE CONDUCTION HEADSET AND AN OPTIONAL RECONFIGURED WAIST STRAP TURNED HAPTIC INTERFACE. THE PLATFORM PROVIDES VALUABLE MICRO-SERVICES FOR PBLV, INCLUDING REAL-TIME NAVIGATION, SCENE ANALYSIS, AND OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE, ALL OF WHICH COULD TRANSFORM WORKPLACE EXPERIENCES FOR PBLV. TO REALIZE THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT, A TRANSDISCIPLINARY TEAM BRINGS EXPERTISE ACROSS ENGINEERING (COMPUTER VISION, HAPTICS, SENSORS, AND WIRELESS), MEDICINE (NEUROLOGY AND REHABILITATION), AND MANAGEMENT (ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE AND BEHAVIOR).

THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF ADVANCED, CONNECTED WEARABLES IN WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENTS FACES SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL, BUSINESS, SOCIAL, AND LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES. THIS TRANSLATIONAL PROJECT SEEKS TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES BY COMPLETING FOUR INTER-CONNECTED TASKS: TASK 1 PERFORMS THE FIRST DETAILED, WORKPLACE-ORIENTED STUDY THAT ASSESSES NAVIGATION ACCURACY OF VIS4ION, AS MEASURED USING ADDITIONAL CAMERAS AND INERTIAL MEASUREMENT UNITS; TASK 2 BUILDS ON THE CURRENT VIS4ION INTERFACES TO ESTABLISH SCALABLE, REPRODUCIBLE, AND LOWER-COST TACTILE FEEDBACK, TOGETHER WITH A NEW AUDIO-BASED ?COGNITIVE ASSISTANT? FOR GUIDANCE; TASK 3 AUGMENTS THE WEARABLE WITH HIGH-SPEED 5G CONNECTIVITY TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME, POWERFUL CLOUD-BASED MACHINE VISION PROCESSING; TASK 4 AFFORDS A SERIES OF NOVEL STUDIES TO ASSESS THE WORKPLACE EXPERIENCES OF PBLV VIA OUR PARTNER, LIGHTHOUSE GUILD. THE ASSESSMENT INCLUDES BOTH ?THINK ALOUD? RECORDINGS AND CONTEXTUALIZED REFLECTIONS. THE TOTAL COST OF BLV WAS RECENTLY ESTIMATED TO BE $3 TRILLION DOLLARS GLOBALLY. THE PATHOLOGIC LINK BETWEEN VISION LOSS AND INACTIVITY PRECIPITATES DEBILITY AND UNEMPLOYMENT. MOBILITY LOSSES LEAD TO EMPLOYMENT BARRIERS, AS PBLV STRUGGLE DURING DAILY COMMUTING, WAYFINDING IN THE WORKPLACE, AND VARIABLE WORK ROUTINES THAT HAVE BEEN INTENSIFIED BY THE PANDEMIC. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO INCREASE THE SAFETY PROFILE AND EASE-OF-USE OF A WEARABLE PLATFORM TOWARD ?CONNECTED? DYNAMIC NAVIGATION IN COMPLEX WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENTS. FUTURE GOALS FOR SCALING THE PLATFORM INCLUDE ADDING ADDITIONAL SOCIAL CAPABILITIES SUCH AS FACE AND EMOTION RECOGNITION TO SUBSTANTIVELY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN A SMARTER AND MORE CONNECTED, DISABILITY-FIRST CITY LANDSCAPE. BEYOND THE ENVISIONED IMPACT ON SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, AND IMPROVING THE LIVES OF PBLV, THIS PROGRAM WILL FOSTER FORMAL AND INFORMAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE, UNDERGRADUATE, MEDICAL, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CLINICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL STEM/STEAM RESEARCH.

CE PRINCIPLES ARE BASED ON THE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES AND ELIMINATING WASTE FROM PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES; A TRULY CIRCULAR ECONOMY KEEPS MATERIAL IN CONTINUOUS USE BY DESIGN. BY DEEPLY INTEGRATING DIVERSE DISCIPLINES THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE TEAM?S PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED, PROVEN HOLISTIC SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK, THE CIRCULARITY ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL (CAP), THE PROJECT CAN TACKLE THE COMPLEX CHALLENGES THAT CURRENTLY INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. THIS WORK WILL UTILIZE THE CAP FRAMEWORK TO CONVERGE CIRCULARITY ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES FOR THE FIRST TIME: FROM MOLECULES (E.G., FUNCTION-PROPERTY AND ECOTOXICITY), TO MATERIALS (E.G., POLYMERS, ELECTRONICS, PAPER PRODUCTS), AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT (E.G., DESIGN FOR VALUE AND REVERSIBLE BUILDING DESIGN). WORKING WITH WELL-POSITIONED COLLABORATORS FROM NGOS, GOVERNMENT, AND INDUSTRY, THE PROJECT TEAM WILL CONVERGE AND CONNECT THESE SILOED RESEARCH TOPICS TO CREATE A PATH TO OPTIMIZING CIRCULARITY IN TWO MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS, ATLANTA, GA, AND PITTSBURGH, PA. THE TWO CITIES WILL BE INVOLVED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT AND WILL HAVE ACCESS TO DATA FACILITATING THE USE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO INFORM PUBLIC POLICY AND SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING. THIS PROJECT WILL INCREASE PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IN STEM, AS THESE GROUPS WILL BE PRIORITIZED IN RECRUITING GRADUATE STUDENTS FOR THE PROJECT; INCREASE PUBLIC SCIENTIFIC LITERACY AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THE USE OF OPEN DATA AND FREE MOBILE CITIZEN SCIENCE APPS; IMPROVE THE WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS IN SOCIETY BY REDUCING WASTE AND IMPROVING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT; DEVELOP A DIVERSE, GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE STEM WORKFORCE THROUGH THE CURRENT EDUCATION CENTER AT UPITT AND STUDENTS WORKING ON THIS PROJECT AT EACH UNIVERSITY; AND DEEPEN PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN ACADEMIA AND OTHERS.

THE FIRST WILL COMBINE INFORMATION FROM EXPERTS IN THE FIELDS OF DISASTER SCIENCE, COASTAL ENGINEERING, FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY, NONPROFIT MANAGEMENT, AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE. THE FIRST WILL PROVIDE A TOOL FOR COMMUNITIES PREPARING FOR, RESPONDING TO, AND RECOVERING FROM DISASTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THE FOOD SYSTEM IS A COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEM MADE UP OF A SET OF AUTONOMOUS, INTERDEPENDENT SUB-SYSTEMS. WHEN A DISASTER OCCURS, MULTIPLE SYSTEMS ARE IMPACTED. CURRENTLY, WE RELY ON SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL AND INFREQUENT MEASURES OF FOOD AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY. FURTHER, CURRENT MEASURES DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR DISASTER RISK TO MULTIPLE SUB-SYSTEMS.

GUIDED BY THIS PRINCIPLE AND MOTIVATED BY THE GLOBAL GOAL OF NET-ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050, THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON DEMONSTRATION OF A SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR LARGE-SCALE HYDROGEN DEPLOYMENT AND CRITICAL MATERIALS MINING FROM EARTH?S ABUNDANT HYPERSALINE BRINES (E.G., SEAWATER). HYDROGEN IS A GREEN FUEL THAT CAN HELP ACCELERATE DECARBONIZATION PROCESSES, AND MATERIALS SUCH AS LITHIUM AND RARE EARTH ELEMENTS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN INDEPENDENCE. THIS PROJECT EMPHASIZES TRANSFORMATION FROM A LINEAR TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY; IT ENABLES A CONVERGENT, INNOVATIVE TEAM OF UNIVERSITIES, INDUSTRY PARTNERS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND STUDENTS/TRAINEES TO ENSURE THAT THE KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPED TRANSITIONS EFFECTIVELY INTO MANY ASPECTS OF PRACTICE. THE PROPOSED CIRCULAR USE OF WATER FOR FUEL BY RENEWABLE ENERGY AND EXTRACTION OF CRITICAL MATERIALS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION HAS BROAD SOCIETAL IMPACTS FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.

THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THE SUSTAINABLE MINING OF GREEN HYDROGEN IN PARALLEL WITH VALUE-ADDED CRITICAL ELEMENTS FROM HYPERSALINE BRINES (E.G., SEAWATER) FOR CLEAN ENERGY APPLICATIONS. MOTIVATED BY THE GLOBAL GOAL OF NET-ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050, CIRCULAR ECONOMY PRINCIPLES GUIDE OUR DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE PROCESSES FOR MATERIALS/FUELS PRODUCTION, UTILIZATION, AND RECYCLING. SEAWATER REPRESENTS THE MOST ABUNDANT RESOURCE ON THE EARTH, WITH IMMENSE SURFACE ACCESSIBILITY AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF SOLUBILIZED ELEMENTS IMPERATIVE FOR CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. SEAWATER CAN ALSO BE SPLIT USING RENEWABLE ENERGY (E.G., SOLAR) TO OBTAIN HYDROGEN FUEL, WITH BENIGN OXYGEN GAS AS A BYPRODUCT. HYDROGEN PRESENTS A ZERO-EMISSION FUEL (PRODUCING WATER IN A FUEL CELL), PART OF A CIRCULAR SUSTAINABLE PROCESS. DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION FOR EXTRACTING HYDROGEN AND CRITICAL ELEMENTS FROM SEAWATER REQUIRES A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM FROM UNIVERSITIES, INDUSTRY PARTNERS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND STUDENTS/TRAINEES. WITH OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES AND RESEARCH RESULTS IN CRITICAL AREAS, WE AIM TO INTEGRATE MULTIDISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE, TOOLS, AND MODES OF THINKING UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY PRINCIPLES TO ACCELERATE AND CONVERGE OUR RESEARCH TO TWO INTEGRATED PROTOTYPES: A MINERAL-WATER SEPARATION REACTOR AND DOWNSTREAM ELECTROLYZER (PRODUCING HYDROGEN FROM THE REDUCED-SALINE EFFLUENT).

A DEADLY COMBINATION OF CLIMATE SHOCKS, PRICE INCREASES AND CONFLICT HAVE PUSHED 50+ MILLION PEOPLE TO THE EDGE OF FAMINE, HIGHLIGHTING THE VULNERABILITY OF OUR GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEM. SHOCKS TO THE FOOD SYSTEM ARE NOT ISOLATED AND CAN CASCADE. FOR EXAMPLE, CLIMATE SHOCKS ARE OFTEN CORRELATED, HITTING MULTIPLE PRODUCTION AREAS AROUND THE WORLD AT THE SAME TIME, RESULTING IN FOOD PRICE HIKES THAT CAN LEAD SOME COUNTRIES TO IMPOSE EXPORT BANS, DRIVING GLOBAL PRICES EVEN HIGHER. FORTUNATELY, CORRELATED CLIMATE SHOCKS ARE INCREASINGLY PREDICTABLE. OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST EXTREME HEAT, DROUGHT AND HEAVY RAINS, DRIVEN BY SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES, HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. THIS PROJECT LEVERAGES THAT PREDICTIVE ABILITY TO COLLABORATE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ALONG THE FOOD SYSTEM TO DEVELOP ACTIONABLE MODELS TAILORED TO THEIR NEEDS AND DECISION-POINTS. UNDERSTANDING, AND ANTICIPATING, THE VULNERABILITY OF THE GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEM TO PREDICTABLE CLIMATE SHOCKS IS CRITICAL. IT WILL ALLOW GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AID GROUPS TO MITIGATE FOOD CRISES AND HELP COMMUNITIES BUILD RESILIENCY BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THIS CONVERGENCE RESEARCH HAS TWO PRIMARY OBJECTIVES. FIRST, IT WILL CREATE PREDICTIVE MODELS THAT ACCOUNT FOR INTERLINKAGES ACROSS FOOD SECURITY DRIVERS. WHILE MODELS FOR CROP PRODUCTION, METEOROLOGICAL FORECASTS, PRICE, TRADE, AND HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY EXIST, THEIR CURRENT LACK OF INTEROPERABILITY MEANS THAT THE MODELS DO NOT READILY ALLOW FOR FEEDBACKS, INTERACTIONS OR MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY TO BE PERPETUATED THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED MODEL REQUIRES A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONVERGENCE SCIENCE APPROACH, BRINGING TOGETHER CLIMATOLOGISTS, HYDROLOGISTS, SOCIOLOGISTS, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMISTS, STATISTICIANS AND POLICY EXPERTS TO APPROPRIATELY MODEL CORRELATED SHOCKS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS THROUGH THE FOOD SYSTEM. SECOND, TO PRODUCE ACTIONABLE OUTPUT, THESE MODELS NEED TO BE CO-DEVELOPED WITH STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE BEGINNING. STAKEHOLDERS WILL GUIDE MODEL INPUTS, OBJECTIVES, SCENARIOS AND HELP DESIGN THEIR OUTPUT. THE RESEARCHERS WILL WORK WITH DECISION-MAKERS TO CO-PRODUCE MODELS THAT QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE SHOCKS ON LOCAL AND GLOBAL FOOD PRODUCTION, TRADE AND PRICES, AND ENUMERATE THE VULNERABILITY OF THE HOUSEHOLDS AND REGIONS TO THESE SHOCKS. THIS PROJECT WILL ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DRIVERS WITHIN EACH COMPONENT OF THE INTEGRATED MODEL, SUCH AS BOLSTERING OUR THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE LINKAGES BETWEEN SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND CLIMATE, KEY NODES IN THE GLOBAL FOOD TRADE SYSTEM, AND THE EFFECT OF COMBINATIONS OF SPECIFIC FOOD SECURITY DRIVERS. ALONG WITH IMPROVING EACH SEPARATE MODEL COMPONENT, THIS PROJECT WILL FACILITATE THEIR INTERACTION, IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE CORRELATION OF WEATHER TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PRICES WHILE MORE CAREFULLY ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY. TO SUPPORT THE ADOPTION OF THIS APPROACH TO MODEL DEVELOPMENT IN OTHER FIELDS, THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP PROTOCOLS FOR DECISION-MAKER COPRODUCTION OF MODELS. BY BRINGING TOGETHER ACADEMICS WITH CONSEQUENTIAL REAL-WORLD DECISION-MAKERS WORKING ON BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC FOOD SECURITY, THIS PROJECT WILL HELP IDENTIFY DRIVERS OF HUNGER THAT ARE RELEVANT IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS WITHIN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

THROUGH THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY, THE ASSEMBLED CATHODE ACHIEVES HIGHER CHEMICAL AND ELECTROCHEMICAL STABILITY, ULTRA-LOW INACTIVE MATERIAL CONTENT IN THE CATHODE (LESS THAN 1%), AND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE STORAGE COST TO REPEL WATER IN THE AIR DUE TO THE STABILITY IN AMBIENT AIR. THIS NEW ELECTRODE MANUFACTURING METHOD MAY ENABLE LONGER DRIVING MILEAGE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND A LONGER BATTERY LIFE SPAN. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW BATTERY CATHODE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, LEVERAGING A UNIQUE GAS PHASE CONDUCTING POLYMER COATING TECHNIQUE USING OXIDATIVE CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (OCVD). A MULTI-FUNCTIONAL CONDUCTING POLYMER PREPARED THROUGH OCVD ACHIEVES ULTRA-HIGH ACTIVE MATERIALS CONCENTRATION (UP TO 99%) DUE TO THE HIGH CONDUCTIVITY AND ADHESIVE FUNCTION OF THE OCVD POLYMERS. THE OCVD POLYMERS PROTECT THE CATHODE SURFACE BY LIMITING UNFAVORABLE REACTIONS AND PHASES SUCH AS DETRIMENTAL CATHODE/ELECTROLYTE INTERFACIAL PHASES AND WATER ADSORPTION ON THE CATHODE SURFACE.

ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR OBTAINING EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, AND SOCIAL INTERACTION, YET REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER FOR PWDS, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AMERICA. THIS BARRIER IS FURTHER EXACERBATED FOR SOME UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, SUCH AS AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO EXPERIENCE HIGHER STRAIN TO OBTAIN THE SAME STANDARD OF LIVING AS A SIMILAR HOUSEHOLD MEMBER WITHOUT A DISABILITY. THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN, MAINTAIN, AND HAVE EXPANDED COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT OPTIONS ARE LIMITED FOR PWDS WHO ARE UNABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY DRIVE, RESULTING IN REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE, LIMITED COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND LACK OF MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP ADVANCED DRIVING TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL SERVE TO CULTIVATE THE SKILLSET AND ABILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY DRIVE. A CONSORTIUM OF RESEARCHERS, INDUSTRY LEADERS, EDUCATORS, PWDS, AND VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS WILL PRODUCE A PROOF OF CONCEPT IN THIS CONVERGENCE ACCELERATOR PHASE I PROJECT, TO FURTHER ADVANCE SCIENCE, PROSPERITY, AND WELFARE OF PWDS, WHO REPRESENT THE LARGEST MINORITY GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS PROJECT REMAINS DEEPLY ROOTED IN UNIVERSAL DESIGN, CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE INTERVENTION, AND EMBRACES A DIVERSE COMMUNITY IN DISCIPLINE AND IN REPRESENTATION TO BRING FORWARD AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION FOR ACQUIRING THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT DRIVER.

THE BURGEONING TECHNOLOGY OF ADDITIVE CONSTRUCTION, OR THREE-DIMENSIONAL CONSTRUCTION PRINTING (3DCP), MIGHT EXACERBATE THE SITUATION. BECAUSE CONCRETE (INKS) USED IN 3DCP CONSISTS OF MUCH MORE BINDERS (MOSTLY PORTLAND CEMENT) COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL CONCRETE, THE INCREASING ADOPTION OF 3DCP IS NOW SPEEDING-UP THE CONSUMPTION OF CEMENT IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. THE INNOVATION IN THE 3DCP INKS NEEDS TO BE ACCELERATED TO CHANGE THE SITUATION - GREENER INKS NEED TO BE DESIGNED, PRODUCED, AND SUPPLIED TO THE MARKET MORE QUICKLY. THE CARBON EMBODIMENT AND OTHER ASPECTS, INCLUDING ENERGY CONSUMPTION, THE SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCY, THE BROADER ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, ARE SELDOM CONSIDERED HOLISTICALLY IN THE LIFE CYCLE DESIGN OF MOST GENERAL-PURPOSE CONCRETE, NOT TO MENTION THE 3DCP CONCRETE. THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ASPECTS MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING. SIGNIFICANT GAPS EXIST BETWEEN THE MATERIAL SCIENCE, PRINTER MANUFACTURING, CONCRETE PRODUCING, SUPPLY NETWORKS, GOVERNMENTAL LEGISLATION AND POLICIES, AND THE 3DCP END USERS. THEREFORE, THIS CONVERGENCE ACCELERATOR PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL FRAMEWORK, OPENMATFLO, FOR ACCELERATING THE CONVERGENCE AT THE CONCRETE INDUSTRY AND 3DCP NEXUS. THE RESEARCH CAN HAVE FUNDAMENTAL SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT BY CONTRIBUTING TO THE INNOVATION OF NEW MATERIALS FOR THE 3DCP INDUSTRY.

HOWEVER, THE TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS VARY GREATLY FOR DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS (I.E., INTER-PATIENT VARIABILITY). A HARDENED DETECTION ALGORITHM WILL NOT BE ADEQUATE FOR ALL PATIENTS TO ACCURATELY DETECT THE TARGETING DISEASE (OR EVENTS) WITH SUCH VARIABILITY. THE CURRENT IMPLANTABLE DEVICES, ONCE IMPLANTED, ONLY ALLOW THE PARAMETER VALUES OF THE DETECTION ALGORITHMS TO BE ITERATIVELY TUNED BY DOCTORS.

THIS TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES DISPOSAL OF PLASTIC WASTES IN LANDFILLS. THE NOVEL APPROACH TURNS A WASTE PRODUCT INTO AN ASSET. FURTHER, THE ENERGY REQUIRED FOR THIS NEW PROCESS IS 7-10 TIMES LOWER THAN THE PRODUCTION OF VIRGIN RESINS FROM PETROLEUM BECAUSE THE TEMPERATURES INVOLVED ARE LOWER THAN THOSE IN THE CURRENT PRODUCTION PROCESSES (110-130 OC). THE OPERATION COST IS LOWER THAN THE PETROLEUM-BASED POLYMERS BECAUSE NO CATALYSTS ARE USED AND THE EQUIPMENT COST IS LOWER BECAUSE STANDARD EQUIPMENT FROM CHEMICAL INDUSTRY IS USED. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE COST EFFECTIVE AT SMALL-MEDIUM-LARGE PLANT SIZES. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MAIN BENEFITS OF THIS INNOVATION: (1) PREVENTION OF DISPOSAL IN LANDFILLS; (2) PRODUCTION OF RECYCLABLE PLASTIC PRODUCTS; (3) REDUCTION OF CARBON FOOTPRINT; AND (4) LOWER COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE SOCIETAL BENEFITS ARE THE REDUCTION OF LAND USED FOR LANDFILLS, THE REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS GENERATION, THE REDUCTION IN OCEAN PLASTICS, AND AN INCREASED SUSTAINABILITY OF MATERIALS. THIS PROJECT WILL ENABLE THE SEPARATION OF MOST OF THE RESINS IN PLASTIC WASTES USING A SEQUENCE OF SOLVENTS WITH EACH SOLVENT SPECIFICALLY DISSOLVING A SPECIFIC RESIN.

IN VITRO, THESE CELLS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER EFFICIENCY FOR BLOOD MALIGNANCIES AND SOLID TUMORS. THIS PROJECT MAY ENABLE LARGE-SCALE AND RENEWABLE PRODUCTION OF HOMOGENOUS T CELLS WITH OPTIMAL AND PERSISTENT TUMOR-KILLING PROPERTIES. THIS APPROACH AIMS TO ADDRESS THE UNMET CHALLENGES OF T CELL EXHAUSTION, IMPROVE SCALABILITY, REDUCE REPEATED BLOOD COLLECTION, AND OFFER BROAD PATIENT ACCESS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY FOR GENERATION OF IPSC-DERIVED NAI?VE CD4+ AND CD8+ T CELLS WITH FIDELITY, REPRODUCIBILITY AND SCALABILITY. THE PLATFORM EMPLOYS A PROPRIETARY METHOD TO GENERATE IPSC-DERIVED THYMIC EPITHELIAL CELLS AS A CRITICAL ELEMENT TO ENABLE NA?VE T CELL PRODUCTION. THE RATIONALE RESIDES IN THE NATURAL BIOLOGY OF THE THYMUS, WHERE THE TRANSITION OF IMMATURE CD4+CD8+ DOUBLE POSITIVE T CELLS TO NAI?VE CD4+ OR CD8+ T CELLS REQUIRES INTERACTION WITH THYMIC EPITHELIAL CELLS THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED POSITIVE SELECTION. CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT NOTCH-ACTIVATION BASED IPSC-DERIVED T CELL METHODS BECAUSE T CELLS DEVELOPED THROUGH SOLE NOTCH ACTIVATION ARE PHENOTYPICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DIFFERENT FROM NAI?VE T CELLS. MAJOR TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS IN NOTCH ACTIVATION-BASED EXTRATHYMIC DIFFERENTIATION METHODS ARE ADDRESSED BY PROVIDING BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT THYMIC POSITIVE SELECTION SIGNALS. THE RESULTING PRODUCT ENABLES A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF IPSC-BASED T CELL IMMUNOTHERAPIES WITH CLINICALLY RELEVANT CELL FIDELITY. REPRODUCIBILITY AND SCALABILITY OF THE PROPOSED PLATFORM WILL BE ASSESSED AND OPTIMIZED IN A BIOREACTOR TO DEMONSTRATE VIABILITY FOR COMMERCIALIZATION.

NEARLY 40% OF AMERICANS WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IN THEIR LIFETIME. DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER IN LATER STAGES DRAMATICALLY REDUCES TREATMENT OPTIONS, LEADING TO POOR PROGNOSIS AND LOW SURVIVAL RATES. IN ADDITION, THE AVERAGE COST OF TREATMENT FOR LATE-STAGE PATIENTS CAN BE 3?5 TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT FOR EARLY-STAGE PATIENTS DUE TO THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF EXPENSIVE THERAPIES. THESE MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF TREATMENT CONTRIBUTE TO THE HIGH ECONOMIC BURDEN OF CANCER. THUS, DETECTING CANCER EARLIER WILL NOT ONLY LEAD TO IMPROVED PATIENT OUTCOMES BUT WILL LIKELY REDUCE THE OVERALL COSTS OF CANCER TREATMENT. MOREOVER, A MINIMALLY INVASIVE AND HIGHLY ACCURATE DIAGNOSTIC COULD BE BROADLY ADMINISTERED TO EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY THOSE WITH VARIOUS CANCERS, ENHANCING THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL FURTHER. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE I PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP AN ADVANCED MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM FOR THE ISOLATION AND ASSESSMENT OF CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS (CTCS) AND CTC CLUSTERS (CTCCS) FOR CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING. MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES IN VARIOUS FORMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ISOLATE THE EXTREMELY RARE CTC POPULATION FROM BILLIONS OF BLOOD CELLS, BUT THESE TECHNOLOGIES SUFFER FROM THREE MAJOR PROBLEMS: 1) LOW SAMPLE PURITY, 2) LOW NUMBERS OF ISOLATED CTCS/CTCCS, AND 3) CTC/CTCC HETEROGENEITY. TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE DEVICE FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS ISOLATION AND ASSESSMENT OF SINGLE AND CLUSTERED CTCS AND THEIR MOLECULAR SIGNATURES, ENABLING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW, HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND ACCURATE LIQUID BIOPSIES FOR CANCER.

CULTIVATING ANIMAL CELLS TO CREATE ANIMAL TISSUES, INCLUDING MUSCLE AND FAT, ALLOWS MANUFACTURERS TO CREATE REAL ANIMAL MEAT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ANIMAL-FARMED MEAT. PRODUCING MEAT IN THIS METHOD MAY PROVIDE A HEALTHIER, SAFER, AND MORE ETHICAL SOURCE OF REAL ANIMAL MEAT. THIS MANUFACTURING PROCESS AVOIDS INDUSTRIAL ANIMAL FARMING AND CONSEQUENTLY USES SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LAND AND WATER. IT ALSO AVOIDS THE GREENHOUSE GASES EMITTED BY INDUSTRIAL ANIMAL FARMING AND MAY EMIT FAR FEWER GREENHOUSE GASES. CULTIVATED MEAT COULD RESULT IN A HEALTHIER PUBLIC AS WELL SINCE ITS CONTROLLED PRODUCTION WILL LIKELY RESULT IN FEWER FOODBORNE ILLNESSES AND AVOID THE CRAMPED CONDITIONS OF INDUSTRIAL ANIMAL FARMS THAT CAN BREED NEW ILLNESSES. THE ABILITY TO GROW MEAT IN NEARLY ANY LOCATION INCREASES THE NATION?S FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE AND REDUCES DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN FOOD IMPORTS.

ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS, FOOD WASTE IS VALUED AT $2.4 TRILLION/YEAR WORLDWIDE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPENSE ATTRIBUTED TO TRANSPORT. ELECTRONIC WASTE IS APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION TONS/YEAR WITH LESS THAN 18% BEING RECYCLED GLOBALLY. CURRENTLY, DISPOSABLE SENSORS ARE USED TO PREVENT FOOD WASTE, YET THESE SENSORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELECTRONIC WASTE PROBLEM. THE PROPOSED PRINTED, BIODEGRADABLE SENSORS WILL ENHANCE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING TO MOVE FROM DISPOSABLE TO ON-DEMAND BIODEGRADABLE SENSORS. THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY ADDRESSED BY THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS OVER $300 BILLION IN THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN AND EVEN LARGER IN THE BROADER PERISHABLE MARKETS. THE TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFT TO PRINTED, BIODEGRADABLE SENSORS WILL PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COMPARED TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE USING DISPOSABLE OR SEMI-RECYCLABLE MATERIALS.

STUDENTS THAT COULD BENEFIT THE MOST FROM LEARNING APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE HOME ACCESS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM LOWER-INCOME, RURAL, AND AT-RISK MINORITY POPULATIONS. WHILE NEW BROADBAND FUNDING INITIATIVES MAY MAKE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SITUATION, MILLIONS OF STUDENTS IN LOW-INCOME AND RURAL AREAS CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO USE NEW ADVANCES IN WEB TECHNOLOGIES AND INTELLIGENT AGENTS TO PROVIDE A SOFTWARE SOLUTION THAT WILL ENABLE ANY STUDENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMPLETE DIGITAL HOMEWORK WORKFLOW INCLUDING INTERACTIVE LESSONS, VIDEOS, AND ROBUST TEACHER FEEDBACK EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE UNRELIABLE OR NO ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. UNCONNECTED ADULT LEARNERS WILL ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE PROJECT AS TECHNICAL SKILLS TRAINING INCLUDING COMPUTER PROGRAMMING WILL BE SUPPORTED.

IN 2020, THE TOTAL COST OF CANCER CARE WAS NEARLY $210 BILLION. DUE TO THE NATURE OF CURRENT CANCER DIAGNOSTICS, MOST CANCERS ARE DIAGNOSED AND TREATED DURING LATE-STAGES. THIS RESULTS IN A LARGE ECONOMIC BURDEN TO PATIENTS, FAMILIES, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, AND FACILITIES. TO ADVANCE THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC AND REDUCE THE NATION?S HEALTHCARE BURDEN, THERE IS A NEED FOR CANCER SCREENING, DIAGNOSTIC, AND MONITORING DEVICES THAT ARE NON-INVASIVE, COST-EFFECTIVE, EASY-TO-USE, AND ACCURATE. THE PROPOSED PLATFORM FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF MULTIPLE TYPES OF EPITHELIAL CANCERS 1) ADDRESSES THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE NON-INVASIVE PORTABLE SCREENING DEVICES; 2) PROVIDES FASTER, MORE DISCRIMINATORY ASSESSMENTS IN NEAR REAL-TIME; 3) YIELDS THE MOST PRECISE AND ACCURATE RESULTS TO IDENTIFY CANCERS EARLIER, WHEN INTERVENTIONS ARE MORE IMPACTFUL, LESS EXPENSIVE, LESS INVASIVE, AND MORE LIKELY TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES.

TODAY, THERE IS NO SINGLE TEST THAT CAN DETERMINE IF A PERSON HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. BECAUSE THE DIAGNOSIS IS COMPLEX, INVASIVE, AND EXPENSIVE, THESE TESTS ARE ONLY PERFORMED ONCE SYMPTOMS, SUCH AS MEMORY LOSS, BEGIN TO MANIFEST. THESE SYMPTOMS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ONLY BECOME APPARENT ONCE THE DISEASE HAS ALREADY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN.

ONE OF THE MAJOR UNMET NEEDS WITHIN BIOTECHNOLOGY IS A DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY THAT ENABLES GENE THERAPIES TO REACH THE DESIRED ORGAN WITHIN THE BODY WITHOUT RAISING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE. RECENT ADVANCES HAVE UNLOCKED MANY POTENTIAL TREATMENTS FOR GENETIC DISEASES, BUT THEIR USE IN THE CLINIC IS HAMPERED BY A LACK OF DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES. THIS PROJECT WILL VALIDATE A NEW NON-VIRAL PLATFORM FOR THIS PURPOSE AND APPLY IT TO COMMERCIAL USE IN A RARE DISEASE INDICATION. THE PROJECT PROVIDES A GENE REPLACEMENT THERAPY FOR UREA CYCLE DISORDER PATIENTS, WHO ARE CURRENTLY TREATED USING A COMBINATION OF DRUGS AND DIET THAT SHOWS LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS. THEIR REGIMENS REQUIRE UP TO 40 PILLS PER DAY IN COMBINATION WITH INCREDIBLY STRICT DIETARY CONTROL TO AVOID CONSUMING TOO MUCH PROTEIN. EVEN STILL, ELEVATED BLOOD AMMONIA RESULTS IN NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE AND HIGH NEONATAL MORTALITY. CAREGIVERS FACE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS OF CARE TO MONITOR DIET, SUPPLEMENTS, AND MEDICATIONS.

FACING INCREASING DISEASE PRESSURE AND A CHANGING CLIMATE, GROWERS AROUND THE WORLD SPEND $80 BILLION ON NEARLY SIX BILLION POUNDS OF PESTICIDES EACH YEAR, AND YET STILL EXPERIENCE YIELD LOSSES OF 20-40% DUE TO PESTS AND DISEASE. BROAD-ACTING, CHEMICAL PESTICIDES - CURRENTLY THE INDUSTRY STANDARD - ARE LOSING BOTH EFFICACY AND PUBLIC SUPPORT AS RESISTANCE TO PESTICIDES SPREADS AND THE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BECOME CLEAR. THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY REDESIGN CROP TREATMENTS TO CREATE A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND EFFICIENT FOOD SYSTEM. LEVERAGING SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY, CRISPR, AND DATA SCIENCE, THIS SBIR PHASE I PROJECT ADDRESSES THIS NEED BY DEVELOPING A NEW CLASS OF MICROBIAL BIOPESTICIDES THAT PRECISELY TARGET AND KILL CROP PATHOGENS WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING BENEFICIAL MICROBES, INSECT POLLINATORS, OR HUMANS. WITH AN INITIAL FOCUS ON TREATING TOMATOES (320,000 ACRES IN THE US, $32 MILLION ADDRESSABLE MARKET), THIS PROJECT SETS THE STAGE FOR PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR MAJOR GLOBAL MARKETS LIKE CITRUS ($600 MILLION), OLIVES ($1.8 BILLION), AND RICE ($2.7 BILLION). THE PROJECT PROVIDES TARGETED SOLUTIONS FOR BACTERIAL DISEASES IN AGRICULTURE. HISTORICALLY OVERLOOKED AND UNDERSERVED BY THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY, BACTERIAL DISEASES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY DEVASTATING OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS DUE TO A LACK OF EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS, GROWING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE, AND CLIMATE CHANGE DRIVING HIGHER DISEASE PRESSURES. BUILDING FROM A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM, THIS SBIR PHASE I PROJECT AIMS TO ENGINEER IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL INCREASE THE EFFICACY AND TRACTABILITY OF THE MICROBIAL BIOPESTICIDE IN OUTDOOR AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS. THIS INCLUDES APPLYING MOLECULAR BIOLOGY TECHNIQUES TO INCREASE MICROBIAL COLONIZATION WITHIN COMPLEX MICROFLORA TO INCREASE PRODUCT EFFICACY, EXTEND MICROBIAL PERSISTENCE IN PLANTS TO PROVIDE LONGER PROTECTION, AND REDUCE THE RATE OF RESISTANCE TO EXTEND PRODUCT LIFETIMES. FURTHERMORE, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A BIOINFORMATICS ALGORITHM TO BETTER PROGRAM THE MICROBES TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET ONLY THE DISEASE-CAUSING PATHOGENS. FINALLY, THE TEAM WILL DEMONSTRATE PRODUCT EFFICACY IN LAB-GROWN TOMATO PLANTS WITH THE GOAL OF SURPASSING THE INDUSTRY STANDARD OF 70% EFFICACY AND WILL COMPARE PERFORMANCE TO TWO INDUSTRY STANDARD CHEMICAL PESTICIDES.

THIS IMPROVED COMPLIANCE, ALONG WITH DIETARY AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS, MAY LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN SOCIETAL HEALTH OUTCOMES BY DECREASING HOSPITALIZATION RATES AND THE ASSOCIATED COSTS. OUTSIDE-THE-CLINIC MONITORING MAY OBVIATE THE NEED FOR SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL VISITS, SHORTENING THE DIAGNOSTIC TIMELINE FROM WEEKS TO DAYS AND REDUCING CARDIOLOGISTS? WORKLOAD. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRESCRIPTION-BASED WEARABLE SENSOR PATCH FOR THE CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR PATIENTS FOR PERIODS OF UP TO TWO WEEKS. THIS SENSOR PATCH LEVERAGES MICROPHONES AND INERTIAL MEASUREMENT UNITS (I.E. ACCELEROMETERS AND GYROSCOPES) TO CAPTURE HEARTBEAT-INDUCED SOUNDS AND VIBRATIONS ON THE CHEST WALL, RESPECTIVELY. A SOFTWARE TOOL BASED ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IS DEVELOPED TO INFORM CARDIOLOGISTS OF ABNORMAL EVENTS AND PATTERNS IN THE CARDIAC SIGNALS ALONG WITH THEIR CORRESPONDING TIMESTAMPS. THE TECHNOLOGY ALSO OFFERS HEMODYNAMIC FEATURES SUCH AS SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC TIME INTERVALS AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY PARAMETERS TO ASSIST CARDIOLOGISTS WITH THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.

BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE CANNOT USE COMPUTERS BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS, INSTEAD USING AUDIO-BASED, SCREEN READING SOFTWARE AND REFRESHABLE BRAILLE DISPLAYS TO MEET DIGITAL INFORMATION NEEDS. BRAILLE DISPLAYS, WHICH ARE NEEDED FOR PRECISION READING AND WRITING TASKS (SUCH AS CHECKING SPELLING AND GRAMMAR) CAN ONLY PRESENT A SINGLE LINE OF INFORMATION, USUALLY 40 CHARACTERS AT A TIME. THE DISPLAY LIMITATIONS OF THESE DEVICES ARE EXACERBATED BY THEIR STAGGERING COSTS; RELIABLE DISPLAYS ARE PRICED AT $3,000 OR MORE. CURRENT ACTUATION TECHNOLOGIES CANNOT MEET THE NEED FOR MULTILINE DEVICES DUE TO THEIR HIGH MATERIAL AND INTEGRATION COSTS, AND CORE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FOR DECADES. LOWERING THE COST OF A SINGLE-LINE DISPLAY MAY INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE BLIND, WHILE AN AFFORDABLE MULTILINE DISPLAY MAY RESULT IN EVEN GREATER IMPACT. THE GOAL FOR THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS TO MEET NEEDS TO BOTH EXTEND ACCESS TO BUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT SEEK TO PROVIDE REFRESHABLE BRAILLE TO THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, AND VISITORS. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILINE BRAILLE DISPLAY POWERED BY CHEMICAL FUELS. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON A SOFT MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM THAT DISTRIBUTES GASEOUS CHEMICAL FUELS TO MICROLITER VOLUME CYLINDERS. SPARKS IGNITE THE GAS IN INDIVIDUAL CHAMBERS RESULTING IN THE PULSED ACTUATION OF ELASTOMERIC MEMBRANES THAT COVER THE TOP OF EACH CYLINDER. THE CORE INNOVATION ENABLING THIS FUNCTIONALITY STEMS FROM THE REALIZATION THAT THE FLAMES IN EACH CYLINDER QUENCH THEMSELVES AT THE MICROFLUIDIC INTAKE PORT. THUS, VALVES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONTROL INDIVIDUAL ACTUATIONS, PREVIOUSLY UNREALIZED IN SOFT, PNEUMATIC ACTUATION ARRAYS. REMOVING THE NEED FOR VALVES SIMPLIFIES THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, REDUCES SYSTEM SIZE, AND SUBSTANTIALLY LOWERS THE SYSTEM COST. THE SYSTEM LEVEL INNOVATIONS IN THIS PROJECT MAYU RESOLVE DOWNSTREAM TECHNICAL CHALLENGES PRESENT IN OTHER TACTILE DISPLAY TECHNOLOGIES. AN ALL-RUBBER COMPOSITION ALLOWS FOR THE DESIGN OF A HERMETICALLY SEALED PLATFORM WHICH PREVENTS DUST AND LIQUID INGRESS, AND WHICH MAY ELIMINATE DAMAGE FROM IMPACT. IN ADDITION, WHILE MAINTENANCE IS A LARGE PAIN POINT FOR MANY BRAILLE DISPLAY CUSTOMERS, THE PROPOSED DISPLAY INTERFACE IS INEXPENSIVE AND MAY BE COMPLETELY REPLACED, AS IT CONTAINS SMALL VOLUMES OF MOLDED SILICONE RUBBER AND WIRE.

MICROPLASTICS ARE RAPIDLY BECOMING A GLOBAL CONCERN, AS THEY CAN EASILY BE INGESTED, INTRODUCING POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS AND CARCINOGENIC ADDITIVES INTO THE DIETS OF WILDLIFE AND HUMANS. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO CONSISTENT PROTOCOLS AVAILABLE FOR THE ACCURATE AND SYSTEMATIC RECORDING OF MICROPLASTIC POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS IN WATER. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS ALSO NO EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO SEQUESTER MICROPLASTICS FROM TRIBUTARIES, EFFLUENT STREAMS, RESERVOIRS, AND LAKES. THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED BY AQUATIC EMISSIONS RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS AND MUNICIPAL RIVERKEEPERS, AS IT MAY PROVIDE THEM WITH A UNIVERSAL TOOL FOR MICROPLASTIC MONITORING AND SEQUESTRATION. ADDITIONALLY, THIS DEVICE CAN BE DEPLOYED AS PART OF WASTEWATER AND DRINKING WATER TREATMENT INFRASTRUCTURE, TO POTENTIALLY REMOVE MICROPLASTICS FROM AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS.

UNLIKE FINE MESH NETS THAT CAN EASILY GET CLOGGED WITH ALGAE, SLOW DOWN RIVER FLOW, AND ENTRAP AQUATIC WILDLIFE, THIS DEVICE USES A PATENTED ?ARTIFICIAL ROOT? BIOFILTER TO ENTRAP MICROPLASTICS. THIS BIOFILTER IS A DENSE MESH OF FIBERS THAT PHYSICALLY ENSNARE SEDIMENT IN THE UPPER STRATA OF A RIVER?S WATER COLUMN, WHICH IS WHERE ALMOST ALL MICROPLASTIC IS FOUND. WHEN SUBMERGED IN WATER, THIS NETWORK HOSTS BACTERIA THAT PRODUCE STICKY BIOFILMS THAT CAN FURTHER ADHERE SMALL AQUATIC SEDIMENTS LIKE MICROPLASTICS. THE NETWORK, WHILE DENSE, IS UNEVEN AND HAS OPENINGS THAT ALLOW FOR THE TRANSIT OF SMALL AQUATIC ORGANISMS. EACH BIOFILTER IS ATTACHED TO A REMOVABLE PAD, MAKING IT EASY TO SWAP BIOFILTERS ONCE THEY BECOME SATURATED. EACH PAD IS HOUSED WITHIN A HYDRODYNAMIC FLOTATION FRAME, AIMED TO ALLOW THE DEVICE TO BE DEPLOYED IN BOTH RIVERS, STREAMS, AND RESERVOIRS. DUE TO IT HAVING NO MECHANICAL COMPONENTS, THIS TECHNOLOGY OPERATES PASSIVELY, REQUIRES NO ELECTRICITY, AND DEMANDS MINIMAL MAINTENANCE TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY.

YET, UNLIKE OTHER SENSORY SYSTEMS (E.G., VISION, HEARING), WHOSE ARTIFICIAL ANALOGUES HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED SOCIETY (E.G., IMAGE AND SPEECH RECOGNITION), MIMICKING OLFACTION REMAINS A GRAND CHALLENGE. THIS IS IN PART DUE TO THE FACT THAT, TO RECOGNIZE ODORS, BIOLOGICAL NOSES USE A LARGE NUMBER OF SENSORS ?AN ESTIMATED 400 SENSORS IN HUMANS, EACH SENSOR DETECTING DIFFERENT PROPERTIES OF ODOR MOLECULES. BUILDING AN ODOR-DETECTION INSTRUMENT WITH SUCH HIGH NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF SENSORS HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO DATE. BUT THIS IS CHANGING. NEW SENSING TECHNOLOGIES HAVE EMERGED OVER THE PAST DECADE THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP LARGE AND DIVERSE ARRAYS OF CHEMICAL SENSORS. PROMISING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE THOSE THAT USE THE SAME SENSORS AS BIOLOGICAL NOSES, MINIATURIZATION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS NANO-PHOTONIC AND MICRO-ELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS, AND SENSORS THAT CAN DETECT MULTIPLE PROPERTIES OF AN ODOR MOLECULE. IN PARALLEL, THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN ALGORITHMS TO MIMIC ODOR PROCESSING IN THE BIOLOGICAL OLFACTORY SYSTEM, AND IN NEURO-MORPHIC HARDWARE TO EFFICIENTLY PROCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA. IN CONCERT, THESE ADVANCES OFFER TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN ARTIFICIAL OLFACTION AND CHEMICAL SENSING THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WERE TECHNICALLY IMPLAUSIBLE. HOWEVER, THIS REQUIRES BRINGING TOGETHER A DIVERSE GROUP OF EXPERTS WHO CURRENTLY WORK LARGELY INDEPENDENTLY ACROSS DISCIPLINES (E.G., BIOCHEMISTRY, PERCEPTION, BIOENGINEERING, MACHINE LEARNING, HEALTHCARE, MANUFACTURING). TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, A CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF RESEARCHERS WILL ORGANIZE AN INTERACTIVE WORKSHOP TO (1) DISCUSS OPPORTUNITIES FROM EMERGING SENSING AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE READY TO BE TURNED INTO PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS, AND (2) IDENTIFY APPLICATION AREAS IN WHICH THEY CAN HAVE THE GREATEST SOCIETAL IMPACT, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, HEALTHCARE, QUALITY CONTROL OF FOOD AND BEVERAGES, PRECISION AGRICULTURE, AND HOMELAND SECURITY. THE GOAL OF THIS WORKSHOP IS TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE 3-YEAR ROADMAP FOR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN ARTIFICIAL CHEMO-SENSORY SYSTEMS THAT MAY LEAD TO NEW PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL COLLABORATE WITH A FACILITATOR COMPANY TO DESIGN A 4-DAY WORKSHOP WITH A VARIETY OF CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT ACTIVITIES, TO BE PERFORMED IN SMALL GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALLY.

THROUGHOUT THE WORKSHOP, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE DIVIDED INTO SMALL BREAKOUTS FOR GROUP EXERCISES. THESE GROUPS MAY BE FORMED RANDOMLY OR ENGINEERED BASED ON SOME FACTOR OF IMPORTANCE (E.G., DIVERSITY OF EXPERTISE, CAREER STAGE, SECTOR). DEPENDING ON THE ACTIVITY, IT MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO PLACE PARTICIPANTS IN BREAKOUT BASED ON COMMONALITY VS DIVERSITY. THE RESEARCH TEAM AND THE FACILITATION TEAM WILL WORK TOGETHER TO DETERMINE, FOR EACH ACTIVITY, THE BEST WAY OF ORGANIZING PARTICIPANTS. THE WORKSHOP WILL BE STRUCTURED INTO A SERIES OF STEPS TO ?DEFINE? THE NEED, ?IDENTIFY THE SOLUTION? AND THEN ?TARGET APPLICATIONS.? IN STEP 1, PARTICIPANTS WILL DEVELOP KEY REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE CHEMICAL SENSORS AND SENSOR SYSTEMS OF THE FUTURE. IN STEP 2, PARTICIPANTS WILL IDENTIFY POTENTIAL APPROACHES IN FIVE AREAS: SAMPLE DELIVERY, BIOLOGICAL SENSORS, MICRO-ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTS, MULTIPARAMETER SENSORS, AND COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS. FINALLY, IN STATE 3, PARTICIPANTS WILL IDENTIFY APPLICATION AREAS WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD HAVE SOCIETAL IMPACT IN 2-, 5- AND 10-YEAR TIMEFRAMES, AS WELL AS IDENTIFY THOSE IN THE END-USER COMMUNITIES WHO SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN THE SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG TERM.

HYDROGEN PRODUCTION, STORAGE, AND SEPARATION FOR END-USE ARE CRITICAL CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING A HYDROGEN ECONOMY. THE STANDARD GAS STORAGE METHOD, WHICH IS TO COMPRESS IT UNDER HIGH PRESSURE IN A TANK, CAN LEAD TO PERCEIVED SAFETY ISSUES.

WOUND CARE MANAGEMENT IS A MAJOR HEALTHCARE CHALLENGE WITH OVER 6 MILLION SUFFERERS IN THE US ALONE, LEADING TO HUGE ECONOMIC AND HEALTH COSTS. MEDICARE WOUND COST PROJECTIONS RANGED FROM $28.1 TO $96.8 BILLION, WITH SURGICAL AND DIABETIC WOUNDS BEING THE MOST EXPENSIVE. THE INCREASING WOUND PREVALENCE HAS RESULTED IN ECONOMIC BURDEN, REDUCED MOBILITY, AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PATIENT. BY OFFERING REAL-TIME MONITORING AND THERAPY, THE PROPOSED PLATFORM MAY REDUCE THE OCCURRENCE OF COMPLICATIONS, THUS DECREASING THE RISK OF CHRONIC WOUND DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, TIMELY THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION USING THE PROPOSED PLATFORM MAY ALLOW FOR EFFICIENT WOUND MANAGEMENT, DECREASING THE RISK OF TRAUMATIC AMPUTATIONS AND MORTALITY. COMMERCIALIZATION OF A PERSONALIZED WOUND THERAPY PLATFORM ALSO MAY IMPROVE CHRONIC CARE, WHICH TRADITIONALLY HAS LOW ADHERENCE.

THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY USES A NOVEL FABRICATION METHODOLOGY TO REALIZE A CONFORMABLE PLATFORM FOR IMPERCEPTIBLE DEVICES. THE METHODOLOGY RESULTS IN A HIGHLY FLEXIBLE PLATFORM THAT ENABLES CONTROLLED DEFORMATION TO ACCOMMODATE RIGID CIRCUIT COMPONENTS, WHILE MAINTAINING FLEXIBILITY FOR USER COMFORT. THE PROPOSED PLATFORM COMBINES SPATIAL WOUND MONITORING AND THERAPY WITH A FEEDBACK MECHANISM TO IMPROVE THERAPEUTIC EFFICIENCIES. THE PLATFORM MEASURES SPATIAL CHANGES IN MULTIPLE WOUND BIOMARKERS (URIC ACID, LACTATE, PH, AND TEMPERATURE) TO OBTAIN COMPLETE INFORMATION ON WOUND HEALTH. THE INFORMATION IS SUBSEQUENTLY USED TO TREAT THE WOUND SPATIALLY WITH PHOTOBIOMODULATION.

THE GOAL OF THIS POSE PROJECT IS TO SCOPE AN OPEN-SOURCE ECOSYSTEM (OSE) FOR OPENCILK, A NEW TASK-PARALLEL, FULLY OPEN-SOURCE PLATFORM FOR PROGRAMMING MULTICORE COMPUTERS, THE DOMINANT ARCHITECTURE FOR COMPUTING TODAY. THE RECENT DEMISE OF MOORE'S LAW AND THE IMPENDING END TO THE MINIATURIZATION OF SEMICONDUCTOR CIRCUITRY HAVE ENDED SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY'S VIRTUAL MONOPOLY ON GROWING COMPUTING PERFORMANCE. OPENCILK IS A KEY TECHNOLOGY FOR MULTICORE PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING - DEVELOPING FAST CODE FOR APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON COMMODITY AND CLOUD MULTICORE COMPUTERS - GIVING APPLICATION DEVELOPERS A POWERFUL ALTERNATIVE SOURCE FOR PERFORMANCE. THE PROJECT'S NOVELTIES INCLUDE PURSUING AN ACADEMIC-FIRST STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPING AN OPENCILK OSE BY FOCUSING ON WINNING THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS, EDUCATORS, AND STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT WELL SERVED BY EXISTING TASK-PARALLEL PROGRAMMING PLATFORMS. AMONG THE PROJECT'S IMPACTS ARE THE CREATION OF AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR EXPANDING THE SET OF OPENCILK USERS AND CONTRIBUTORS, FOR BUILDING AN ACADEMIC COMMUNITY FOR PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING, AND FOR PROVIDING TEACHING MATERIALS FOR PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING USING OPENCILK. THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO ENABLE THE NEWLY CREATED PERFORMANCE-ENGINEERING COMMUNITY TO IMPROVE MODERN PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS ~W INCLUDING MACHINE LEARNING, SIMULATION OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA, AND COMPUTER SECURITY - WHICH ARE NATIONAL STRATEGIC PRIORITIES. OPENCILK'S ADOPTION MARKET IS CONSTITUTED LARGELY FROM THE FOLLOWING SEGMENTS: (1) NONACADEMIC SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS WHO ARE MOSTLY FROM INDUSTRY; (2) RESEARCHERS DEVELOPING TASK-PARALLEL PROGRAMMING TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS; (3) EDUCATORS TEACHING PARALLEL COMPUTING AND SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING; AND (4) STUDENTS WHO TAKE THEIR CLASSES. THE MISSION OF OPENCILK IS TO MAKE IT EASY FOR DEVELOPERS TO WRITE FAST AND CORRECT MULTICORE CODE, FOR RESEARCHERS TO PIONEER TECHNOLOGIES THAT EMPOWER DEVELOPERS, AND FOR EDUCATORS TO TEACH AND STUDENTS TO LEARN SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING. TO THAT END, OPENCILK ABIDES BY THE FOLLOWING GUIDING PRINCIPLES: - THE LANGUAGE SHOULD BE SIMPLE AND EASY TO REASON ABOUT. - BUGS SHOULD BE EASY TO RELIABLY DISCOVER AND DIAGNOSE. - PARALLEL PERFORMANCE SHOULD BE SCALABLE, COMPOSABLE, AND BACKED BY SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL GUARANTEES. - THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE OPEN SOURCE AND EASY TO USE, TEACH WITH, MODIFY, AND EXTEND. THIS OSE PROJECT IS EXPERIMENTING WITH STRATEGIES FOR OUTBOUND, INBOUND, AND PEER NETWORKING TO IDENTIFY AND ENGAGE POTENTIAL OPENCILK USERS AND CONTRIBUTORS IN ACADEMIA.

INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT, AND ACADEMIA RELY ON A SUPPLY CHAIN OF OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS. RECENTLY, HACKERS HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT, IN ORDER TO HACK THEIR TARGETS, THEY CAN POISON THE WATER STREAM TO EFFECTIVELY AFFECT ALL CONSUMERS OF SOFTWARE AT ONCE. PROBLEMS WITH THESE SORTS OF ATTACKS HAVE CAUSED SITE- AND INTERNET-WIDE DISRUPTION AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FROM MAJOR ATTACKS LIKE XCODEGHOST TO SOLARWINDS, SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS HAVE SEEN INCREASING TRENDS IN DAMAGE, SOPHISTICATION, AND FREQUENCY. EXISTING APPROACHES TO OPEN-SOURCE DEVELOPMENT FACE CHALLENGES IN ACHIEVING WIDESPREAD ADOPTION, MOSTLY DUE TO THE COMPLICATED NATURE OF SECURING THE OPEN SOURCE SUPPLY CHAIN --- A HIGHLY INTERCONNECTED NETWORK OF ACTORS WITH DIFFERENT SOCIO-TECHNICAL MOTIVATIONS. THIS PROJECT TACKLES THE CHALLENGE OF DEVELOPING AND SUSTAINING A COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE USABLE SECURITY. THE PROJECT'S NOVELTIES ARE IN RECOGNIZING AND BUILDING A BROADER SOLUTION THAT CAN SECURE NOT ONLY CLOUD SYSTEMS, BUT EMERGING APPLICATIONS SUCH AS AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) AS WELL AS MISSION CRITICAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS THE POWERGRID.

NATURAL HAZARDS, SUCH AS FLOODS, LANDSLIDES, EARTHQUAKES, TORNADOES, AND WILDFIRES, THREATEN MORE THAN 57% OF THE US NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. MODELING THESE COMPLEX NATURAL HAZARDS PUSHES THE FRONTIERS OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, MULTI-SCALE MODELING, IN-SITU VISUALIZATION, BIG-DATA ANALYSIS, AND MACHINE LEARNING. SCIENTIFIC SOFTWARE CODES ARE OFTEN DEVELOPED IN AN AD HOC MANNER BY UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WITH VERY LITTLE EXPOSURE TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES. THE ROBUSTNESS AND OPEN-SOURCE NATURE OF THESE SCIENTIFIC CODES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE NATION, ITS PEOPLE, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE PROJECT ESTABLISHES THE TUITUS FOUNDATION (LATIN FOR ?TO PROTECT OR CARE FOR?), A SUSTAINABLE, INCLUSIVE, OPEN ECOSYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC CODES FOR NATURAL HAZARD ENGINEERING (NHE). THE PROJECT?S NOVELTIES ARE CREATING A UNIFIED INTERFACE THAT SUPPORTS INTEGRATION TESTING, RESEARCH REPRODUCIBILITY, AND WORKFLOW PROVENANCE IN DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS. THE PROJECT SUPPORTS BUILDING SCALABLE, AUTOMATED TESTING AND WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING (HPC) ENVIRONMENTS. THE PROJECT TACKLES THE SOCIAL ISSUES AROUND BUILDING AND SUSTAINING A COMMUNITY BY ESTABLISHING A GOVERNING BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITY-DRIVEN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN NHE. THE PROJECT CREATES AN INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY BY OFFERING GUIDELINES AND TRAINING FOR ONBOARDING AND SUPPORTING NEW DEVELOPERS THROUGH HACKATHONS AND GOOGLE SUMMER OF CODE. BY AUTO-DEPLOYING THOROUGHLY TESTED HPC SOFTWARE TO THE NSF-FUNDED DESIGNSAFE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE, THE PROJECT IMPACTS THE BROADER COMMUNITY OF 6,000 NHE RESEARCHERS BY MAKING ROBUST NHE CODES IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE. OPEN-SOURCE CODES IN NHE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND REGIONAL-SCALE RISK ASSESSMENT. THE INTEGRATION OF TUITUS FOUNDATION?S HPC CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION/CONTINUOUS DELIVERY (CI/CD) SERVICE WITH DESIGNSAFE CREATES A PARADIGM SHIFT IN OPEN-SOURCE CODE DELIVERY IN NHE, IMPROVING REAL-WORLD POLICY DECISIONS DURING CRITICAL NATURAL HAZARD EVENTS. THE TUITUS FOUNDATION ADOPTS A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES IN THE OPEN-SOURCE ECOSYSTEM (OSE) BY OFFERING A STANDARD APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API) FOR HPC AND HETEROGENOUS HARDWARE ARCHITECTURES AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS FROM HPC, MACHINE LEARNING, DATABASE SCHEMAS, JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS, AND VISUALIZATIONS. THIS PROJECT IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO INTEGRATE HPC-SCALE CI TESTING WITH NATURAL HAZARD ENGINEERING CODES FOR MULTI-JOB PIPELINES. THE TAPIS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACES THAT ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO AUTOMATE DATA MANAGEMENT AND JOB EXECUTION ON HPC AND CLOUD RESOURCES. TAPIS OAUTH2 PROVIDES A SEPARATE SECURITY LAYER FOR MANAGING USER CREDENTIALS, ALLOWING TAPIS TO ACCESS MANY DIFFERENT STORAGE AND COMPUTING RESOURCES ON BEHALF OF THE USER.

AS A RESULT, THIS APPROACH REQUIRES EXTENSIVE ITERATIVE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO EXPERIMENTS, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE LENGTH AND COST OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THESE CHALLENGES HAVE RESULTED IN AN INEFFICIENT AND UNPREDICTABLE MICROBIOME THERAPEUTIC DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, LIMITING THE NUMBER OF EFFICACIOUS MICROBIOME THERAPEUTICS THAT COULD SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES WORLDWIDE. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THESE CHALLENGES BY RELIABLY AND COST-EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFYING THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATES FOR A WIDE RANGE OF INDICATIONS. THIS PLATFORM COULD REPLACE THE CURRENT ITERATIVE AND UNPREDICTABLE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IN THE DRUG DISCOVERY STAGE. THE UTILITY OF THE PLATFORM WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY DEVELOPING NEW THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATES FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES AND VALIDATING THE EFFICACY OF THESE CANDIDATES IN PRECLINICAL STUDIES.

THE BUILDING RESILIENT AND SECURE 5G SYSTEMS (BRASS) PROJECT TACKLES THE CHALLENGE OF LOW-LEVEL FIRMWARE EXPLOITATION OF 5G DEVICES, AND THEREBY PREVENT MAJOR CLASSES OF ATTACKS. THE MAIN RESEARCH CHALLENGE TO BE TARGETED IN BRASS BY THE PERFORMER RED BALLOON SECURITY (RBS) IS: HOW DOES ONE PROVIDE SECURITY ON A 5G HOST IN A DIVERSE SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENT WITH MULTIPLE VENDORS AND UNKNOWN YET-TO-BE-DISCOVERED VULNERABILITIES ALMOST CERTAINLY PRESENT IN THE FIRMWARE OF THE 5G DEVICES ? PARTICULARLY, GIVEN THE CHALLENGE OF EXTREME DIVERSITY OF FIRMWARE FORMATS, AND FREQUENT LACK OF ACCESS TO SOURCE CODE AND/OR HARDWARE DESIGN INFORMATION? CURRENTLY, ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT PER-DEVICE, PER-PROCESSOR, AND PER-FIRMWARE REVERSE ENGINEERING EFFORT BY AN EXPERT. THE BRASS PROJECT WILL RESEARCH METHODS TO AUTOMATE AND ACCELERATE THE INTEGRATION OF PASSIVE AND ACTIVE FIRMWARE PROTECTIONS TO PLATFORMS IN CRITICAL AND VULNERABLE ENVIRONMENTS. LEVERAGING RED BALLOON SECURITY?S (RBS) EXPERIENCE IN COMMERCIALIZING ITS FIRMWARE SECURITY SOLUTIONS, BRASS WILL NOT ONLY RESULT IN A PROTOTYPE THAT ADDRESSES ANTICIPATED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) MISSION SCENARIOS AND CAN BE TRANSITIONED INTO DOD OPERATIONAL USE, BUT WHICH CAN ALSO CREATE PROTECTIONS THAT 5G ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) WOULD WANT TO INCORPORATE INTO THEIR PRODUCTS. GIVEN ITS FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE PRESENTED BY THE DIVERSITY OF 5G DEVICES, BRASS WOULD SUPPORT RBS'S BROADER GOAL OF PROVIDING WORLD-CLASS PROTECTIONS TO A BROAD CLASS OF CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM (CPS) EMBEDDED FIRMWARE. BRASS IMPROVEMENTS TO RBS?S CORE FIRMWARE ANALYSIS AND MODIFICATION TOOLCHAIN WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, ENABLING A VARIETY OF FIRMWARE ANALYSIS, IMPROVEMENT, AND HARDENING APPLICATIONS. RED BALLOON SECURITY (RBS) HAS PIONEERED AND SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED NOVEL, HOST-BASED EMBEDDED FIRMWARE DEFENSE TECHNOLOGIES CAPABLE OF PREVENTING AND/OR DETECTING LARGE CLASSES OF CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING ONES EXPLOITING ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITIES. THESE CAPABILITIES ARE MERGED INTO THE CANDIDATE FIRMWARE USING RBS'S OPEN FIRMWARE REVERSE ANALYSIS KONSOLE (OFRAK) TOOLKIT, WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE ACCESS TO SOURCE CODE. IN BRASS, RBS WOULD: 1) APPLY FIRMWARE PROTECTIONS TO BASEBAND FIRMWARE ON THE END-USER DEVICES, SECURING THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF ARBITRARY NETWORKS (TRACKS G.1, G.2, G.3); 2) APPLY FIRMWARE PROTECTIONS TO THE PLATFORM AND RADIO FRONT-END FIRMWARE IN THE 5G INFRASTRUCTURE DEVICES, WITHOUT AFFECTING THEIR NETWORK FUNCTIONALITY (TRACKS G.2 AND G.3); AND 3) USE OFRAK'S AUTOTOMY CAPABILITIES TO REMOVE THE CODE IMPLEMENTING NON-ESSENTIAL 5G FEATURES, AND THUS ALL VULNERABILITIES THAT CODE COULD CONTAIN (TRACK G.3 TAILORED NETWORKS NOT REQUIRING A COMPLETE 5G STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION). IN PHASE 1, RBS WILL LEVERAGE A TEAM WITH MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROFICIENCY TO: 1) REFINE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ITS TECHNOLOGY BASED ON THE DOD MISSION SCENARIOS AND NEEDS; 2) CONTINUE ITS ONGOING DIALOGUES WITH 5G OEMS, SUCH AS ERICSSON, NOKIA, AND PARALLEL WIRELESS, AND TO INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE OF THEM IN ITS PHASE 2 TEAM; AND 3) DEMONSTRATE A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROTOTYPE OF 5G FIRMWARE PROTECTIONS. RBS WILL TARGET 5G FIRMWARE TO: 1) PERFORM A SECURITY ASSESSMENT TO HIGHLIGHT SECURITY GAPS, VULNERABILITIES, AND DESIGN FLAWS; 2) DEVELOP A DESIGN DOCUMENT AND PROOF OF CONCEPT DESCRIBING THE NEW FIRMWARE DEFENSE CAPABILITIES; 3) DELIVER A FEATURE-COMPLETE PROTOTYPE INTEGRATED ON TARGET 5G FIRMWARE; AND 4) DEMONSTRATE THE PROTOTYPE?S SECURITY EFFICACY AGAINST AN EXPLOIT IN A 5G TEST ENVIRONMENT.

APPROXIMATELY 350,000 PROXIMAL FEMUR FRACTURES AND 65,000 FEMUR SHAFT FRACTURES OCCUR IN THE UNITED STATES ANNUALLY. DUE TO THE AGING POPULATION, THIS NUMBER OF FRACTURES IS INCREASING AND IS ANTICIPATED TO DOUBLE BY THE YEAR 2050. CURRENT SURGICAL PROCEDURES ARE MANUAL, AND SURGEONS EXPERIENCE A MYRIAD OF COMPLICATIONS TO ALIGN FEMUR FRACTURES, INCLUDING DIFFICULTY IN ACHIEVING ACCURATE REDUCTION, SUBSEQUENT MALALIGNMENT OF BONE FRAGMENTS, HIGH X-RAY RADIATION, NONUNION COMPLICATIONS, AND SOFT TISSUE DAMAGE. MALALIGNMENT IS A SERIOUS COMPLICATION WITH LONG-BONE FRACTURES, WITH A MALALIGNMENT OF 15? OR MORE AFTER FEMUR FRACTURE FIXATION OCCURRING IN 28% OF PATIENTS.

CONNECTING MISSION-CRITICAL DEVICES TO COMMERCIAL 5G NETWORKS WILL TRANSFORM DOD COMMUNICATIONS, BUT IT ALSO INCREASES THE ATTACK SURFACE FOR SENSITIVE AND CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS BY EXPOSING THE TRAFFIC TO THE INTERNET AT LARGE. NATION-STATES HAVE NEARLY INEXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCES TO DISRUPT TRAFFIC OR PASSIVELY RECOGNIZE COMMUNICATIONS PATTERNS VIA NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER THEIR CONTROL, AND THE VERIFIED-TRUST PARADIGM IN A ZERO-TRUST ARCHITECTURE CANNOT PREVENT THESE ATTACKS. ANY SECURE COMMUNICATION SOLUTION IN THE 5G SPACE MUST ACCOUNT FOR ADVERSARIAL INTERNET PATHS THAT TRAVERSE NETWORKS AND ROUTERS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY CONTROLLED BY ADVERSARY NATION-STATES. IN ESSENCE, OPERATING THROUGH 5G NETWORKS REQUIRES NOT JUST FOCUSING ON THE WIRELESS LAST HOP, BUT ALSO THE INTERNET PATHS TO REACH THE LAST HOP. THIS PROJECT COMBINES THREE COMPONENTS TO CREATE AN UNPRECEDENTED ABILITY TO LEVERAGE COMMERCIAL 5G NETWORKS FOR SECURE AND RESILIENT COMMUNICATION. THE FIRST COMPONENT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF PROGRAMMABLE DATA PLANES TO FACILITATE PATH MEASUREMENTS ? AND SHIFT COMMUNICATIONS ONTO TRUSTWORTHY PATHS ? WITHOUT MODIFYING DOD APPLICATIONS, EXISTING NETWORK DEVICES, OR THIRD-PARTY NETWORKS. COMPONENT 2 CREATES AN AUTOMATED MEASUREMENT APPLICATION THAT INTERFACES WITH THE ROUTER FROM COMPONENT 1 TO IDENTIFY ROUTER-LEVEL PATHS THAT AVOID ADVERSARIES, AS WELL AS VERIFY IN REAL-TIME THAT COMMUNICATION PATHS FOR ACTIVE FLOWS BEHAVE AS EXPECTED.

AS SEVERAL MILITARY, GOVERNMENT, AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATIONS RELY ON SUCH END-USER APPLICATIONS, PISMO HARDENS THEM AGAINST THREATS. CONSIDERED THREATS RANGE FROM UNINTENDED EAVESDROPPING TO SABOTAGING CYBER-ATTACKS. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED WHILE USING EXISTING AND AFFORDABLE 5G COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT TRUSTING OR COOPERATING WITH THE 5G OPERATOR. DEPLOYING AND COMMERCIALIZING THE PISMO SYSTEM CONTRIBUTES TO ACHIEVING GREATER NATIONAL SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF COMMUNICATION PRIVACY, WHEREVER SUCH OPERATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT, NONETHELESS ALWAYS OPERATING IN A SECURE AND RESILIENT, YET HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAINTAINABLE MANNER. THE PISMO OVERLAY CONSISTS OF CLIENT SOFTWARE PROVISIONED ON 5G END DEVICES AND SERVER SOFTWARE DEPLOYED IN CLOUDS ON THE INTERNET TO FORM THE BACKBONE OF PISMO; CLIENTS WILL CONNECT VIA THE 5G WIRELESS NETWORK TO THE BACKEND SERVERS.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO LEVERAGE COMMERCIAL INVESTMENTS MADE IN 5G NETWORKS. THE PUSH FOR DOD TO RELY HEAVILY ON 5G COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS IS, HOWEVER, PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE COMMERCIAL NETWORKS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR MANY OF THE ADVERSARIAL SETTINGS AND ELECTRONIC WARFARE (EW) SCENARIOS COMMON IN MILITARY-HARDENED NETWORKS. ACADEMIC RESEARCH MUST PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ADDRESSING FUNDAMENTAL SECURITY CHALLENGES ARISING FROM THE VULNERABILITIES AND DESIGN WEAKNESSES OF 5G NETWORKS. SUCH CHALLENGES MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN MAJOR THREATS THAT THREATEN CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, AND AVAILABILITY OF 5G NETWORKS SUCH AS EAVESDROPPING ON MESSAGES, SPOOFING AND MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS, DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS), AND DOWNGRADING THE SERVICE FROM 5G TO 3G/2G. HISTORICALLY, HOWEVER, MANY OF THE SECURITY-RELATED AND ADVERSARIAL PROBLEMS COMMON TO DOD HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS STRICTLY OUTSIDE OF THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH PURVIEW. THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO CHANGE THIS BY BUILDING UPON THE MOMENTUM TO ACCELERATE ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY RESEARCH INTO SECURE BEYOND-5G WIRELESS NETWORKS. THE TEAM IS JOINING FORCES FROM ACADEMIA, INDUSTRY, AND GOVERNMENT WITH THE FOCUS ON CONSOLIDATING THE ONGOING 5G SECURITY-RELATED RESEARCH EFFORTS OF ITS MEMBERS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BY CREATING RESEARCH EXPERIENCES, INVOLVING BOTH THEORY AND EXPERIMENTS, FOR A DIVERSE TEAM OF BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH HAS THREE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES THAT ENABLE ZERO TRUST SOLUTIONS: (A) PARTICULAR FOCUS ON SIGNAL/WAVEFORM LEVEL AND 5G RADIO ACCESS NETWORK (RAN) SECURITY; (B) FINE-GRANULAR DATA-PLANE AND CONTROL-PLANE THREAT DETECTION, TRACKING, AND DEFENSE MECHANISMS; AND (C) INTEGRATION AND EVALUATION VIA FULL-STACK, OPEN RAN/MOBILE CORE TESTBED. DOD APPLICATIONS ARE THE MAIN MOTIVATION FOR THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. TO BOTH NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE EFFORTS AND MAKE IT MORE GROUNDED, THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE ORGANIZED ACROSS THE FOLLOWING THREE INTERWOVEN ASPECTS: (I) THE MODELING OF THREATS AT THE USER EQUIPMENT (UE), RAN, ENHANCED DATA FOR GLOBAL EVOLUTION (EDGE), BACKHAUL, AND 5G PACKET CORE LEVELS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SUBOPTIMAL 5G NETWORKS ARE; (II) THE DESIGN OF THREAT DETECTION, TRACKING, AND PROTECTION ALGORITHMS/MECHANISMS THAT EFFECTIVELY MODIFY SIGNALING AT THE 5G RAN AND THE SOFTWARE FUNCTIONS/PROTOCOLS AT THE 5G CORE FOR GRANULAR ACCESS CONTROL AND ENCRYPTION; AND (III) FORMAL VERIFICATION OF THE VARIOUS SECURITY REQUIREMENTS OF SERVICE-BASED ARCHITECTURE IN THE CONTEXT OF 5G RAN, CORE, AND INTERNET EDGE THAT USE EXISTING AND NOVEL PROGRAMMABLE HARDWARE. THE LEVEL OF VISIBILITY AND CONTROLLABILITY THAT THIS PROJECT ENABLES WOULD ALLOW THE 5G SERVICE-BASED ARCHITECTURES TO ADAPT THEMSELVES QUICKLY TO MAKE WAY FOR THE MILITARY AND OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES IN A SECURE AND TIMELY MANNER - SIMILAR TO HOW CARS MAKE WAY FOR AMBULANCES AND FIRE TRUCKS ON THE HIGHWAYS, SHARING THE SAME ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE.

THE PROJECT INTRODUCES A CROSS-LAYER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE THAT LEVERAGES THE MODULAR EXTENSIBILITY OF THE NEW 5G SOFTWARE-DEFINED ARCHITECTURE WITH SERVICES, APPLICATIONS, AND PROTOCOL EXTENSIONS TO ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE RUNTIME SECURITY MANAGEMENT OF 5G EDGE-TO-CORE OPERATIONS. IT WILL AUGMENT AND EXTEND, NOT REPLACE, THE EXISTING SD-RAN REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION WITH LOW-LEVEL APPLICATION MONITORING, MACHINE LEARNING, INLINE SECURITY COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT, IDENTITY MANAGEMENT, AND DATA PROVENANCE. THE PROJECT IS INITIATED AT A CRITICAL MOMENT IN THE 5G LIFE CYCLE, PARTICULARLY AS 5G APPLICATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY DEVELOPED FOR HIGHLY SENSITIVE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS, SUCH AS MILITARY, GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PROJECT WILL DISSECT NEW 5G ATTACK SURFACES THAT HAVE EMERGED FROM THE SD-RAN DESIGN AND WILL INTRODUCE SECURITY SOLUTIONS FROM AN EXPERIENCED TEAM OF INFOSEC RESEARCHERS, AND AN INDUSTRY PARTNER WELL-POSITIONED TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION OF THESE SOLUTIONS INTO THE U.S. MARKET. IT DECOMPOSES THE CHALLENGES OF SECURING 5G NETWORKS INTO THREE FOCUS AREAS: THE USER-TO-RAN ATTACK SURFACE, THREATS AGAINST AND WITHIN THE RAN CONTROL PLANE, AND THREATS THAT MANIFEST THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF RAN-TO-CORE (THE GATEWAY BETWEEN 5G AND THE INTERNET) OPERATIONS. THE TOPIC AREAS FOR THIS CONVERGENCE ACCELERATOR PROJECT ARE DECOMPOSED INTO THREE COMPLEMENTARY TECHNICAL THRUSTS. FIRST, THE PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THREATS THAT ARISE FROM HOSTILE USER EQUIPMENT (UE) DESIGNED TO ATTACK RAN OPERATIONS. IT WILL INVESTIGATE 5G-SPECIFIC PRIVACY AND SECURITY ATTACKS THAT SPAN ACROSS THE USER EDGE, FROM 5G PHONES, IOTS, AND SENSOR NETS TO AUTOMOTIVE. UE ATTACKS AGAINST SD-RANS WILL BE ANALYZED, AND NEW SECURITY SERVICE ENHANCEMENTS TO THE RAN WILL BE PROPOSED TO DETECT AND COUNTER THESE ATTACKS. SECOND, THE PROJECT WILL DESIGN SECURITY EXTENSIONS TO THE 5G SD-RAN CONTROL PLANE, BASED ON A FRAMEWORK OF IN-DEPTH 5G-SPECIFIC SECURITY TELEMETRY, AUTOMATED POLICY GENERATION, ML-BASED MODELING, RUNTIME POLICY ENFORCEMENT, AND PROVENANCE-BASED DATA FLOW PROTECTION. FINALLY, THE PROJECT WILL DESIGN 5G-AWARE P4-ENABLED SECURITY SERVICES THAT CAN INTERPLAY WITH THE SD-RAN CONTROL LAYER, OFFERING NOVEL AND SCALABLE METHODS TO INTEGRATE CORE-TO-EDGE DEFENSES. THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROJECT ARE MULTI-FACETED. A PRIMARY GOAL IS TO IMPROVE 5G UE-EDGE SECURITY FOR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS, US DOD, AND THE SOCIETY AT A NATIONAL SCALE. THE SECURITY-ENHANCED SD-RAN WILL DELIVER FEATURES THAT ARE VITAL FOR ADDRESSING COMPLIANCE DIRECTIVES THAT ARE PERVASIVE WITHIN THE DOD, U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS. ANOTHER CRUCIAL PROJECT BENEFIT IS ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE EDUCATION AND DIVERSITY OF THE FUTURE U.S. WORKFORCE. THE TEAM IS COMPOSED OF AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION AND A RESEARCH LABORATORY THAT ARE ACTIVE IN THE PREPARATION OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF COMPUTER SCIENTISTS NEEDED TO PROTECT THE U.S. FROM CYBER ATTACKS. IN PARTICULAR, THE PROPOSAL INCORPORATES A DETAILED EDUCATION AND PARTICIPATION PLAN THAT ENCOURAGES THE INCLUSION OF GRADUATE STUDENTS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN AND MINORITIES, AND WILL BUILD UPON AN ONGOING COLLABORATION WITH A NON-PROFIT FOCUSED ON RETAINING WOMEN IN R&D IN THE WORKFORCE.

HOWEVER, IN MANY AREAS OF THE WORLD, 5G NETWORKS ARE DEPLOYED AND OPERATED BY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE UNTRUSTED AND POTENTIALLY HOSTILE TO THE U.S. IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS, NEW SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEEDED TO SECURE OPERATIONS. THE 5G HIDDEN OPERATIONS THROUGH SECURING TRAFFIC (GHOST) PROJECT PROVIDES FOUR LAYERS OF SECURITY. FIRST, GHOST PROTECTS AGAINST END-USER AND NETWORKING DEVICES FROM BEING COMPROMISED BY A HOSTILE NETWORK. SECOND, GHOST ANONYMIZES INDIVIDUAL IDENTITIES AND OBSCURES USER LOCATIONS. THIRD, GHOST PREVENTS TRAFFIC ANALYSIS THAT COULD REVEAL OPERATIONAL PLANS AND ACTIVITIES BY ANONYMIZING COMMUNICATION CONNECTIONS AND INTRODUCING ?GHOST? TRAFFIC INTO THE NETWORK TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT LEVEL OF ACTIVITY. FINALLY, THE GHOST PROJECT WILL FURTHER OBFUSCATE TRAFFIC ANALYSIS BY INJECTING ?FALSE FLAG? TRAFFIC THAT MODELS REAL OPERATIONS TO CONFUSE AND MISLEAD ANALYSIS. THE GHOST TECHNOLOGY WILL ENABLE ORGANIZATIONS RANGING FROM THE U.S. MILITARY TO PRIVATE ENTITIES TO SECURELY OPERATE OVER INDIGENOUS 5G NETWORKS, REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICS OF THE NETWORK OPERATORS. THE GHOST PROJECT ADDRESSES THE CORE INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGE OF PROVIDING SECURE COMMUNICATIONS RESISTANT TO PENETRATION AND TRAFFIC ANALYSIS OVER UNTRUSTED NETWORKS. THE GHOST PROJECT CONSIDERS THE NETWORK AS A BLACK BOX THAT IS ASSUMED TO BE OPERATED BY A HOSTILE AGENT. ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE WILL YIELD FOUR INTELLECTUAL BENEFITS TO THE RESEARCH AND OPERATIONAL COMMUNITIES. ? FIRST, THE GHOST PROJECT WILL DELIVER TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL PROTECT END-USER DEVICES AND NON-INDIGENOUS NETWORKING EQUIPMENT FROM PENETRATION AND COMPROMISE. THE TECHNOLOGY SECURES DEVICES AT THE HARDWARE LEVEL THROUGH THE USE OF TRUSTED EXECUTION ENVIRONMENTS (TEES). THE IDEA BEHIND A TEE IS THAT ANYTHING COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE CHIP BOUNDARY IS UNTRUSTED. TEES ENFORCE THIS TRUSTED BOUNDARY BY IMPLEMENTING INTEGRITY VERIFICATION OF DATA AND CODE AND ENCRYPTING THEM ONCE THEY CROSS THE TRUSTED BOUNDARY. ? SECOND, THE GHOST PROJECT WILL DELIVER TECHNOLOGY TO ANONYMIZE OR DISGUISE END-USER IDENTITIES, LOCATIONS, AND COMMUNICATIONS ENDPOINTS. END-USER IDENTITIES WILL BE PROTECTED USING SOFTWARE DEFINED CREDENTIALS. LOCATIONS ARE PROTECTED USING GEO-SPATIAL IDENTITY MANAGEMENT. COMMUNICATIONS CONNECTIONS ARE PROTECTED BY PEER-TO-PEER ANONYMIZATION. ? THIRD, THE GHOST PROJECT WILL DELIVER TECHNOLOGY TO OVERLAY NORMAL TRAFFIC WITH ?GHOST? TRAFFIC ? ESSENTIALLY NETWORK WHITE NOISE ? TO OBFUSCATE TRAFFIC ANALYSIS. ? FOURTH, THE GHOST PROJECT WILL DELIVER TECHNOLOGY TO MODEL AND GENERATE ?FALSE FLAG? TRAFFIC. THROUGH MONITORING AND SIMULATION, MODELS OF TRAFFIC PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC OPERATIONS WILL BE GENERATED. ?FALSE FLAG? TRAFFIC INJECTED INTO THE NETWORK WILL REFLECT THE TRAFFIC ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR OPERATION AND BE CONVINCING TO ANY OBSERVERS. GHOST TECHNOLOGY WILL BENEFIT END-USERS OF ANY NETWORK, NOT JUST UNTRUSTED NETWORKS. THE PRIMARY CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS OF THE GHOST PROJECT WILL BE: ? DEVICE PROTECTION FROM NETWORK OPERATOR ATTACKS; ? THE OBFUSCATION OF USER IDENTITIES, LOCATIONS, AND COMMUNICATIONS CONNECTIONS; ? THE OBFUSCATION OF TRAFFIC PATTERNS; ? THE INJECTION OF ?FALSE FLAG? TRAFFIC.

BY DEVELOPING A NEW METHOD TO DETERMINE THE POROSITY OF ROCK MATRICES AND THE IN-SITU ROCK PERMEABILITIES DIRECTLY IN THE FIELD AND AT A SMALLER SCALE (IN THE NANO AND MICRO RANGES), THIS RESEARCH TEAM SEEKS TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF COMPANIES THAT REQUIRE (IN)DIRECT SEISMIC DATA ACQUISITION (E.G., DRILLING ENGINEERS, WIRELINE ENGINEERS, SEISMIC ACQUISITION ENGINEERS, SEISMIC PROCESSING ENGINEERS, PETRO-PHYSICISTS AND GEOPHYSICISTS). THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-FREQUENCY ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY. ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY IS A NON-DESTRUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY THAT GENERATES MECHANICAL WAVES FROM ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCERS. THE TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY UTILIZED IN STUDYING THE LITHOLOGY OF THE EARTH. THE IN-SITU USE OF ULTRASOUND COUPLED WITH A NEW MODELLING CAPABILITIES, MAY PROVIDE A QUICKER, MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, AND INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO FIELD INVESTIGATION. THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED OT DETERMINE THE POROSITY OF ROCK MATRICIES AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE SOFTENING THAT OCCURS DUE TO FRACKING. THE WAVE VELOCITY CAN BE DETERMINED BY TRANSMITTING HIGH-FREQUENCY ULTRASOUND WAVES (>200HZ) THROUGH THE ROCK SPECIMENS AND RELATING THE MEASURED VELOCITY TO MICRO- AND NANO-SCALE VOIDS. ONCE THE WAVE VELOCITY FUNCTION HAS BEEN DETERMINED, THE TEAM WILL TRANSMIT A RANGE OF HIGHER FREQUENCIES WHOSE WAVELENGTHS ARE CLOSER TO THE SIZE OR MICRO- AND NANO-SCALE VOIDS IN THE ROCK MATRIX. THE ATTENUATION, TIME, AND VELOCITY OF THE WAVES AT HIGHER FREQUENCIES WILL BE COMPARED TO DETERMINE THE POROSITY.

THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR SUSTAINABLE COOLING SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO HYDROFLUOROCARBON-BASED REFRIGERANTS THAT RELY ON CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2)-EMITTING SYSTEMS. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A HYDROLOGIC OPEN COOLING SYSTEM (HOCS) THAT CAN MAINTAIN COOLING CHAMBERS AT 1.5-5?C UTILIZING 10% OR LESS OF THE ELECTRICAL POWER OF CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS. THIS PROJECT UNLOCKS ENVIRONMENTAL HEAT AS AN ENERGY RESERVOIR AND OFFSETS SIGNIFICANT ENERGY COSTS OF CONVENTIONAL COOLING SYSTEMS. THE TECHNOLOGY CAN SUPPORT HIGHLY EFFICIENT REFRIGERATION AT A FRACTION OF THE OPERATIONAL COST AND ELECTRICAL DEMAND OF TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS. ADOPTION OF THIS COOLING TECHNOLOGY BY SMALL- TO MID-SIZE SUPERMARKETS WOULD ENABLE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS FOR ELECTRICITY. ON A BROADER SCALE, WIDESPREAD IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS INNOVATION ACROSS A VARIETY OF REFRIGERATION APPLICATIONS WOULD REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION, MEETING THE NEED FOR SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPORT FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY WHILE UPHOLDING CLIMATE GOALS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CONFORMABLE TANK WITH A > 10% STORAGE EFFICIENCY, WHICH EXCEEDS THE POTENTIAL OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY, WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE POTENTIAL FOR HYDROGEN TO REPLACE EXISTING TRANSPORTATION FUELS. WHILE THE AVIATION APPLICATION INTRODUCES UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR HYDROGEN STORAGE, THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT A WIDER VARIETY OF TRANSPORTATION FUEL MARKETS, WHERE DEMAND FOR LIGHTWEIGHT, SAFE, AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE STORAGE SOLUTIONS IS INCREASING. THE STORAGE OF HIGH-PRESSURE GASEOUS HYDROGEN IS A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE FOR ZERO EMISSIONS FUELS, AND MEETING THE STANDARDS FOR MINIMUM BURST PRESSURE, CYCLIC OPERATION, EXTREME TEMPERATURE OPERATION, AND HYDROGEN PERMEATION WITH A CONFORMABLE TANK WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO A WIDE VARIETY OF NEAR-TERM APPLICATIONS, ENABLING THE REDUCTION OF TRANSPORTATION-RELATED EMISSIONS AND REDUCING THE BURDEN OF SENDING CARBON FIBER TANKS TO LANDFILLS AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES.

RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS (RNG) IS ATTRACTIVE AS A CARBON NEUTRAL ENERGY SOURCE AS IT IS DERIVED FROM ORGANIC WASTES SUCH AS FOOD WASTE, AGRICULTURAL WASTE, AND MUNICIPAL BIOSOLIDS. RNG IS PART OF BIOGAS AND REQUIRES COST- AND ENERGY-EFFECTIVE SEPARATION FROM CARBON DIOXIDE.

BY TAILORING THE SURFACE CHEMISTRY OF BISMUTH PARTICLES, THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES CHANGE DRAMATICALLY ON THE MACRO PROPERTY SCALE. IN PHASE I, THE COMPANY DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCING THE FINAL MATERIAL, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLYMERS, SCALE-UP OF MATERIALS, AND COMPOUNDING THAT GENERATED A FABRIC WITH EXCEPTIONAL ELASTICITY, HIGH X-RAY ATTENUATION, AND A VERY THIN PROFILE FOR ITS TARGET WEIGHT. WHILE COMPOSITE MATERIALS WITH GREATER THAN 85 % BY WEIGHT BISMUTH PARTICLE FILLER REQUIRES SPECIALIZED TECHNIQUES AND MOLDING REQUIREMENTS, IT YIELDS A SUPERIOR FINAL MATERIAL THAT OUTPERFORMS ALL RADIATION SHIELDING FABRICS CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES A NUMBER OF THESE PROCESSING CHALLENGES AND FABRICATION TECHNIQUES.

THE TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN CONVERT EXISTING COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINES TO SELF-DRIVING AUTONOMOUS MACHINES. THE ABILITY TO AUTOMATICALLY MEASURE PARTS IS AN IMPORTANT FEEDBACK LINK IN THE PROCESS CHAIN THAT WILL ENABLE FULLY AUTOMATED MANUFACTURING OF THE FUTURE. SPECIFICALLY, THIS AUTOMATION WILL REDUCE THE SPECIALIZED SKILL REQUIRED TO USE A COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINE (CMM). THE INNOVATION WILL ENABLE WORKERS TO OPERATE A CMM AND GET A PRECISE PART MEASUREMENT. THIS DEVICE IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL AS THE SKILLED MANUFACTURING/METROLOGY WORKFORCE IS RETIRING AS IT GIVES NEW EMPLOYEES THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION WITH LITTLE/NO TRAINING. THIS INNOVATION ALSO GIVES THE MANUFACTURING COMPANIES AN OPTION TO BUY A NEW MACHINE OR UPGRADE THEIR EXISTING COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINE. WHILE THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS PART IDENTIFICATION, THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS READY APPLICATIONS IN COMPUTER NUMERICAL CONTROL (CNC) MACHINING, ROBOTICS, AND AUTOMATED ASSEMBLY LINES. THIS CAPABILITY WILL MAKE THE US MANUFACTURING SECTOR STRONGER AND MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED.

APPLYING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)/MACHINE LEARNING (ML) TO THE IMAGE PROCESSING OF PART IMAGES WILL ENSURE CORRECT PART IDENTIFICATION. CORRECT IDENTIFICATION OF PARTS AS SEEN BY THE CAMERA IS THE REMAINING UNSOLVED CHALLENGE TO ACHIEVING SELF-DRIVEN AUTOMATIC MEASUREMENTS OF PARTS. MOST MACHINED PARTS ARE TEXTURELESS AND MOST OF THE INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN THE EDGES. CURRENT IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES WORK WELL WITH TEXTURE-RICH PARTS BUT ARE UNRELIABLE WITH TEXTURELESS MACHINED PARTS.

THE DOWNTIME ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH HIGH PRODUCTIVITY EQUIPMENT CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOST REVENUE, AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE MANUFACTURER DEALS WITH 800 HOURS OF DOWNTIME PER YEAR. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SEEKS TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THIS DOWNTIME, CREATING VALUE FOR MANUFACTURERS. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING APPROACH TO PREDICTING BEARING FAILURE IN ROTATING INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT AND ENABLE MAINTENANCE TEAMS TO CONFIDENTLY PLAN OPTIMAL MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AROUND EQUIPMENT THAT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEGRADING.

THIS SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (STTR) PHASE II PROJECT PROPOSES A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING APPROACH TO MACHINERY PROGNOSTICS. MANY EXISTING DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES FOCUS ON THE MOST LIKELY FAILURE SCENARIOS GIVEN A SET OF TRAINING DATA.

THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT ADDRESSES A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT LIMITS CONVENTIONAL BIO-FERMENTATION, WHICH IS THAT PRODUCING CELLS SUFFER LIMITED HEALTH AND VIABILITY IN EXCHANGE FOR HIGHER YIELDS. IN THIS PROPOSAL, GENETIC TOOLS WILL BE USED TO DIVIDE THE LABOR OF CELL REPRODUCTION AND PRODUCT SYNTHESIS INTO TWO DIFFERENT CELL TYPES, CALLED STEM CELLS AND FACTORY CELLS. AS OLDER FACTORY CELLS BECOME EXHAUSTED, PRODUCTIVITY IS MAINTAINED BY NEW FACTORY CELLS, WHICH ARE BORN FROM THE STEM CELL POPULATION. THE APPROACH MAY BE PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED TO BIOFUELS AND OTHER MOLECULES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE IN LARGE QUANTITIES BY CONVENTIONAL BIO-FERMENTATION BECAUSE THE PRODUCT IS TOXIC TO THE CELLS THAT MAKE IT. IT COULD BE APPLIED TOWARD INCREASING THE PROFITABILITY OF EXISTING BIO-PROCESSES AND ALSO FOR BRINGING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY TOO DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE. IN THIS PROJECT, THE TEAM SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE BENEFITS OF PRODUCING A FUEL (LIMONENE) AND A DAIRY ENZYME (CHYMOSIN), AS PROOF OF ITS APPLICATION IN BIOFUEL AND AGRICULTURAL SECTORS. BROAD INDUSTRIAL IMPLEMENTATION WILL ADVANCE BIO-MANUFACTURING TOWARD THE ?GREEN? REVOLUTION, CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLEANER INDUSTRIES AND DECREASING US AND GLOBAL RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO SOLVE TWO MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF MICROBIAL FERMENTATION PROCESSES: METABOLIC EXHAUSTION AND GENETIC DRIFT. THESE ARE NEARLY UNIVERSAL PROBLEMS IN THE INDUSTRY. HIGHLY PRODUCING CELLS CAN BECOME INACTIVE DUE TO THE LACK OF METABOLIC RESOURCES, CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF PRODUCTS, AND MUTATIONS THAT BREAK THE BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY. IN THIS PROJECT, MICROBIAL STEM CELL TECHNOLOGY (MIST) UNCOUPLES GROWTH AND PRODUCTION BY ESTABLISHING A MULTICELLULAR SYSTEM. ONE CELL TYPE IS DEDICATED TO PRODUCT SYNTHESIS (FACTORY CELLS), WHILE ANOTHER (STEM CELLS) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CELL DIVISION AND THE GENERATION OF NEW FACTORY CELLS. AS OLDER FACTORY CELLS LOSE PRODUCTIVITY, THE BIOREACTOR IS CONTINUOUSLY REPLENISHED WITH NEW FACTORY CELLS, DERIVED FROM THE STEM CELL POPULATION.

HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF WATER IMPURITIES WILL BE EXPLORED TO DETERMINE THE OPERATIONAL ENVELOPE. THE PLANNED EXPERIMENTS INTEND TO HELP QUANTITATE HOW SURFACE FUNCTIONALIZATION WITH IONIC GROUPS INCREASES CHARGE EFFICIENCY AND AFFECTS IMPORTANT ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES SUCH AS CAPACITANCE, RESISTANCE, AND OPERATING LIFETIME. THESE PROPERTIES WILL BE CROSS CHECKED AGAINST DIFFERENT FEED SOLUTION CONCENTRATIONS, THE ABILITY TO PURIFY A GIVEN CONCENTRATION OF FEED SOLUTION, WATER RECOVERY, AND NANOSCALE ELECTRODE PORE CHARACTERISTICS. IONIC MOLECULES OF DIFFERENT CHAIN LENGTHS WILL BE TESTED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO EXTEND CO-ION EXCLUSION BEYOND MESOPORES INTO THE MACROPORE PORTION OF CAPACITIVE ELECTRODES. ADSORPTION STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF IONIC GROUPS ATTACHED TO THE NANOSCALE ELECTRODE PORE SURFACES AND TO DETERMINE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THEIR ATTACHMENT.

THE PLANNED OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY PRODUCTION IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY AND THE INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO BE WORTH MORE THAN $1 TRILLION WITHIN THE NEXT TWO DECADES. ALTHOUGH ONLY 42 MEGAWATTS (MW) OF OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY WERE INSTALLED IN THE U.S. DURING THE LAST 10 YEARS, PLANNED PROJECTS HAVE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY TARGETING 30 GIGAWATTS (GW) BY 2030 AND 110 GW BY 2050, WITH STRONG SUPPORT FROM COASTAL STATES. ACHIEVING THE TARGETS OF OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY REQUIRES COST-EFFECTIVE AND INNOVATIVE COMPONENTS OF THESE ENERGY SYSTEMS. ONE OF THE MAIN COSTS FOR OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS IS THEIR FOUNDATIONS, WITH COSTS TYPICALLY RANGING FROM 14% TO 34% OF THE OVERALL PROJECT COST. OWTS ARE COMMONLY SUPPORTED ON LARGE-DIAMETER FOUNDATIONS, WHICH THE U.S. DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO FABRICATE AND INSTEAD RELIES ON FOUNDATIONS FABRICATED ABROAD. THEREFORE, A U.S.-MANUFACTURED FOUNDATION SYSTEM TO SUPPORT RENEWABLE OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, ENHANCE DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAINS, AND REDUCE DEPENDENCY ON FOREIGN MANUFACTURED FOUNDATIONS IS PROPOSED. THE RESULT OF THIS RESEARCH IS A U.S.-MANUFACTURED ALTERNATIVE WITH SAVINGS OF OVER HALF THE COST PER METER, ENABLING WIDER ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY HARNESSING TECHNOLOGIES.

THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE I PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATING THE PROPOSED MAGNETIC BEARING INTO A CARBON-FIBER FLYWHEEL. THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS TASK COMES FROM HAVING THE THREE MAIN PARTS OF THE FLYWHEEL (COMPOSITE RIM, METAL CORE, AND MAGNETS) CREATED USING DIFFERENT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THE MAGNETIC MATERIALS NEED TO BE PROTECTED AS THEY WILL NOT WITHSTAND THE HIGH SPEEDS OF FESS. DE-RISKING THIS MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS CRUCIAL IN CONTINUING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND IN SCALING UP. ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS THAT THE HIGH SPEEDS OF FESS ARE EXPECTED TO CAUSE HIGH GYROSCOPIC TORQUES DURING SATELLITE MANEUVERS.

HERE, SINGLE-CELL MICROBES ARE ENGINEERED TO PRODUCE VALUABLE METABOLITES USING ENZYMES RATHER THAN SOURCING THESE CHEMICALS FROM PETROLEUM. DEVELOPING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CELL STRAINS WITH HIGH YIELD REMAINS AN ONGOING EFFORT DUE TO THE COMPLEXITIES IN HOW GENETIC CODE LEADS TO PHENOTYPE EXPRESSION. THIS PROBLEM IS ADDRESSED USING A BOTTOM-UP APPROACH TO SCREEN MICROBE POPULATIONS AT THE SINGLE-CELL LEVEL. THE METHOD DEPLOYED TO IDENTIFY METABOLITE CONTENT IN INDIVIDUAL CELLS IS BASED ON INFRARED (IR)-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY WHICH IS LABEL-FREE, QUANTITATIVE, AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE. SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY IS POISED TO DISRUPT THE CHEMICAL VALUE-CHAIN BY PROVIDING AN ALTERNATIVE TO PETROLEUM-BASED CHEMICALS THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND CARBON-NEUTRAL. ONCE A HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE CELL IS IDENTIFIED IT CAN BE SELECTIVELY PROPAGATED TO CREATE ENRICHED CELL LINES. INNOVATIONS IN OPTICAL MICROSCOPY ARE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CELL SCREENING INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WILL ALLOW HIGH-RESOLUTION FOCUSING ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRAL RANGE. THE UPGRADED PLATFORM WILL OPTIMIZE YIELD MORE QUICKLY, PROVIDING VALUE BY REDUCING THE UPFRONT COST TO DEVELOP NEW INDUSTRIAL CELL STRAINS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT EMPHASIZES OPTICAL ENGINEERING TO DEVELOP A MICROSCOPE DESIGNED FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION CHEMICAL IMAGING BASED ON MOLECULAR VIBRATIONAL IR-ABSORPTIONS. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY DEPLOYING FOCUSING ELEMENTS THAT OPERATE OVER A BROAD SPECTRAL RANGE THAT EXTEND STANDARD OPTICAL MICROSCOPES TO INCLUDE MID-INFRARED LIGHT SOURCES. THE OPTICAL INSTRUMENT WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE CHEMICAL CONTENT IN INDUSTRIAL MICROBE STRAINS AND DEVELOP ENRICHED CELL LINES. THESE SINGLE-CELL MICROBE POPULATIONS ARE ENGINEERED TO PRODUCE ENZYMES USED TO CATALYZE THE SYNTHESIS OF VALUABLE METABOLITES.

TRANSIT ZEV FLEETS HAVE STOCHASTIC LOAD CHANGES, HIGH SENSITIVITY TO OPERATOR DRIVING STYLE AND HIGH VARIATION OF BATTERY SIZE, WEIGHT AND DRIVING RANGE, EVEN FOR SIMILAR VEHICLES. THESE CHALLENGES WILL BE ADDRESSED BY DEVELOPING AUTOMATED LEARNING TECHNIQUES BUILT ON ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED IN PHASE I, WHICH USE CONTEXTUALIZED DATA FROM ZEV STOPS AND TRIPS. THE SECOND GOAL IS TO VALIDATE THE PREDICTION ACCURACY VIA PILOTS WITH ZEV FLEETS PROVIDING SCHEDULED BUS SERVICES. THE FINAL GOAL IS DEVELOPMENT OF REAL-TIME, SCALABLE, FLEET OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS WHICH OPTIMIZE DAILY ASSIGNMENT AND CHARGE MANAGEMENT OF ZEV FLEETS. CHANCE-CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION WILL BE MERGED WITH PREDICTIVE CONTROL THEORY TO ADDRESS SCALABILITY AND REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE OF THE RESULTING OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS.

THIS STTR PHASE 1 PROJECT PROPOSES TO ADDRESS A TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IN ENERGY STORAGE. THE REDUCED LEVELIZED ELECTRICITY COST DUE TO THIS STORAGE CAN DIRECTLY BENEFIT THE END-USERS AND BROADER POPULATION IN THE US AND ACROSS THE GLOBE. NOTABLY, EXISTING MECHANICAL STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE MANY ATTRACTIVE FEATURES SUCH AS SHORT TO MID-LOAD RESPONSE, BLACK START, ROBUST, LONG LIFE, SAFETY, AND EFFICIENCY, BUT THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT GOOD AT MEETING SCALABILITY, RELIABILITY, AND COMPACTNESS METRICS. ON THE OTHER HAND, CHEMICAL STORAGE HAS MID-LOAD RESPONSE, LONG-LIFETIME, AND SCALABILITY, BUT IS INADEQUATE WITH REGARD TO SAFETY, SHORT-LOAD RESPONSE, BLACK START, AND EFFICIENCY. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION ALLOWS ENERGY COMPANIES TO EXPLORE LOW-COST TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN OFFER BETTER PERFORMANCE AND CAN BE EASILY INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING FOSSIL POWER PLANTS. THE PRIMARY INNOVATION COMBINES MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES SO THAT THE RESULTANT TECHNOLOGY ADAPTS THE BEST FEATURES TO PROVIDE ENHANCED PERFORMANCE AT A CHEAPER CAPITAL, OPERATIONAL, AND MAINTENANCE COST. THE HYBRID MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL SYSTEM PROPOSED HERE USES SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE (SCO2) AS THE MECHANICAL STORAGE COMPONENT, WHILE CHEMICAL STORAGE IS ACHIEVED USING NATURAL GAS OR HYDROGEN. THIS PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS REFERRED TO AS AN INTEGRATED CHEMICAL AND SCO2 ENERGY STORAGE (ICSCO2ES).

THE CONVERSION OF NUISANCE OR NOXIOUS GASES EMITTED AS WASTE TO VALUABLE LIQUIDS IS NOT PRESENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE. TODAY, MOST OF THE NATURAL GAS PRODUCED DURING THE PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, ALSO KNOWN AS ?ASSOCIATED GAS?, HAS TO BE FLARED. THE FLARING PROCESS DESTROYS THIS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ENERGY RESOURCE, WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND INCREASING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS. GASIFICATION OF BIOMASS WITH THE GOAL OF PRODUCING LIQUID FUELS/CHEMICALS OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF THIS ABUNDANT AND READILY AVAILABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCE.

THE PLATFORM DESCRIBED BY THIS PROPOSAL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DISCOVER MANY TCR BASED THERAPEUTICS, CREATING VALUE FOR PATIENT AND SOCIETY AT LARGE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A PLATFORM FOR IDENTIFYING CLINICALLY VALUABLE TCRS. THIS PLATFORM COULD BE CRITICAL FOR DEVELOPING NEW IMMUNOTHERAPIES AGAINST SOLID TUMORS AND FOR UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY THAT UNDERLIES TCR-ANTIGEN INTERACTION. SCREENING THOUSANDS OF TCRS FOR FUNCTIONAL ACTIVATION AGAINST THOUSANDS OF ANTIGENS IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF TRACKING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNIQUE CELLS. THE PROPOSED PLATFORM AND METHOD LINKS T-CELL ACTIVATION WITH PHAGOCYTOSIS USING ENGINEERED T-MACROPHAGE AND ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELL (APC) LINES. T-MACROPHAGES ENGULF APCS AS DIRECTED BY TCR ACTIVATION, CAPTURING EVIDENCE OF AN INTERACTION WITHIN THE T-MACROPHAGE. THE RESULTING INTERACTIONS CAN BE READ FROM THE T-MACROPHAGES VIA SINGLE-CELL SEQUENCING. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PRODUCE LARGE CELL-BASED LIBRARIES FOR TCR AND ANTIGENS AND TO IDENTIFY INTERACTING TCR-ANTIGEN PAIRS. THE ANTIGEN LIBRARY WILL INCLUDE HUNDREDS OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT CANCER TARGETS, SUCH AS KRAS AND TP53. THESE RESULTS WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF OUR PLATFORM.

WHILE SATELLITES HAVE ENABLED REMOTE DATA COLLECTION, THEY ARE AFFECTED BY WEATHER AND LIMITED IN THE TYPES OF DATA THEY COLLECT. UNCREWED SURFACE VESSELS (USVS) - ROBOTIC BOATS - ARE PROMISING, BUT EVEN TODAY?S SMALLEST OCEANGOING USVS ARE TOO COSTLY FOR MANY APPLICATIONS. THUS, MANY REGIONS OF EARTH?S OCEANS ARE RARELY STUDIED. THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED HERE AIMS TO MEET THIS NEED BY ENABLING LOW-COST DEPLOYMENT OF SENSOR-EQUIPPED ROBOTIC FLEETS. BETTER ACCESS TO OCEAN DATA MAY IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE OCEAN AND ITS RESOURCES, LEADING TO BETTER CLIMATE MODELING, IMPROVED SAFETY, ECONOMIC GAINS, AND MORE EFFECTIVE REGULATIONS. FURTHER, OCEAN MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING OCEAN WATER QUALITY, IDENTIFYING CONTAMINANTS, AND DEVISING STRATEGIES TO PREVENT FUTURE CONTAMINATION AND POLLUTION OF THE OCEAN?S WATERS.

BECAUSE THERE IS INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY IN THE PRECISE LOCATION OF HIGHER CRITICAL FUNCTIONS (E.G., LANGUAGE, MEMORY, LOCOMOTION), EACH PATIENT?S BRAIN MUST BE MAPPED IN A PERSONALIZED WAY. ULTIMATELY, PATIENTS WANT CONFIDENCE THEY WILL BE THE SAME PERSON COMING OUT OF BRAIN SURGERY AS THEY WERE GOING INTO SURGERY, AND CLINICAL TEAMS WANT TOOLS THAT SUPPORT QUANTITATIVE PRE-OPERATIVE SURGICAL PLANNING AND EVIDENCE-BASED PROJECTIONS OF POST-OPERATIVE FUNCTION.

GREENHOUSES CAN BE A FORM OF HIGH PRODUCTIVITY FARMING THAT CONSERVES LAND AND WATER MAKING THEM AN ATTRACTIVE FORM OF SUSTAINABLE AND CLIMATE RESILIENT AGRICULTURE. HOWEVER, GREENHOUSES CONSUME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ENERGY THAN CONVENTIONAL FARMING. FOR GREENHOUSES TO BE A PART OF A SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE FUTURE, THERE IS A NEED TO REDUCE THEIR ENERGY DEMAND. PRIOR RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ORGANIC SOLAR MODULES INTEGRATED INTO GREENHOUSE STRUCTURES MAY REDUCE OR EVEN ELIMINATE EXTERNAL ENERGY DEMAND WHILE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING CROP PRODUCTION. THE GLOBAL COMMERCIAL MARKET OF CONVENTIONAL GREENHOUSES WILL REACH $50.6 BILLION BY 2025. THE GROWING GREENHOUSE MARKET TRANSLATES TO GIGAWATT SOLAR POWER MARKET SIZE. THE ADDED ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF ORGANIC SOLAR MODULE ADOPTION IN GREENHOUSES PROVIDES A PATH FOR WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF ORGANIC SOLAR MODULES AND THE GROWING GREENHOUSE MARKET. THIS STTR PHASE I PROJECT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP FLEXIBLE, SEMITRANSPARENT, ORGANIC SOLAR CELLS THAT ARE TAILORED SPECIFICALLY FOR GREENHOUSE GLAZING INTEGRATION.

IN CONTRAST TO EXISTING WATER TREATMENT APPROACHES, WHICH RELY ON ENERGY INPUTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT, THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS BOTH SUSTAINABLE AND RELIABLE, AND HAS THE FLEXIBILITY, MODULARITY, AND SCALABILITY NEEDED FOR FACILE DEPLOYMENT. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL IMPACT OF THIS DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY IS HIGH, CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY SEEKING WATER TREATMENT SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD BE EASILY MET WITH THE TECHNOLOGY, AND THE SUBSEQUENT JOBS CREATED RELATED TO INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE. THE TECHNICAL INNOVATION OF THIS PROJECT COMES FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOLAR ABSORBER GEL (SAG) MEMBRANE THAT PASSIVELY PURIFIES WATER USING NATURAL SUNLIGHT OR A WASTE HEAT SOURCE. THIS SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO SELECTIVELY CAPTURE CLEAN WATER AT LOW TEMPERATURES AND RELEASE IT UNDER NATURAL SUNLIGHT AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES. COMPARED TO OTHER PASSIVE SOLAR WATER PURIFICATION METHODS, WHICH RELY ON THE ENERGY-INTENSE EVAPORATION AND CONDENSATION PROCESSES, THIS TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT RELY ON A PHASE TRANSFORMATION BUT INSTEAD ABSORBS AND RELEASES LIQUID WATER DUE TO MINOR TEMPERATURE SWINGS AND CAN ACHIEVE THE CRITICAL TEMPERATURE FOR WATER RELEASE WITHIN A MATTER OF MINUTES.

CURRENTLY, ONLY 10-15% OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY RECEIVE CONTINUOUS BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING BECAUSE SUCH MONITORING REQUIRES SPECIALIZED SKILL TO ADMINISTER THE INVASIVE PROCEDURE AND CAN ALSO INTRODUCE POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS. THE REMAINING PATIENTS ARE MONITORED INTERMITTENTLY WITH A NON-INVASIVE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF, RESULTING IN GAPS IN INFORMATION BETWEEN READINGS AND POTENTIALLY DELAYED RESPONSE TIMES.

THE PROJECT WILL STREAMLINE STROKE TRIAGE IN THE PRE-HOSPITAL SETTING TO REDUCE TIME TO INTERVENTION AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES IN STROKE PATIENTS. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE I PROJECT AN EEG-BASED PRODUCT FOR EMS WORKERS TO USE IN THE PRE-HOSPITAL SETTING FOR THE FAST AND OBJECTIVE DIAGNOSIS OF LVO IN SUSPECTED STROKE PATIENTS. IN UNDER FIVE MINUTES, EMS WORKERS WILL BE ABLE TO DEPLOY, COLLECT DATA, AND HAVE THE ANALYZED RESULTS PRESENTED IN AN INTUITIVE DASHBOARD IDENTIFYING THE PROBABILITY OF AN LVO, ENABLING EMS WORKERS TO ROUTE PATIENTS TO STROKE CENTERS WITH EVT CAPABILITIES. WHEN A PATIENT ARRIVES AT THE HOSPITAL, THE DETERMINATION MADE WITHIN THE AMBULANCE WILL BE CONVEYED TO PHYSICIANS WHO CAN THEN IMMEDIATELY START INTERVENTION, REDUCING THE TIME FROM ONSET TO INTERVENTION AND IMPROVING SHORT AND LONG-TERM PATIENT OUTCOMES. COMPREHENSIVE HISTORICAL DATASETS OF EEG-DATA FROM STROKE PATIENTS USING A BROAD ARRAY OF HARDWARE WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL THAT CAN CLASSIFY PATIENTS INTO LVO VS NON-LVO STROKE AND STROKE VS NON-STROKE. AUTOMATION OF DATA CLEANING AND FEATURE EXTRACTION WILL ENABLE A HIGHLY USER-FRIENDLY EXPERIENCE AND THE REQUIRED WORKFLOW INTEGRATION FOR OUR END-USERS, EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS.

TODAY, CUTIS ACCOUNT FOR 400,000 HOSPITALIZATIONS ANNUALLY IN THE UNITED STATES. UNFORTUNATELY, MULTIDRUG RESISTANT PATHOGENS ARE A COMMON CAUSE OF CUTI. MANY ARE RESISTANT TO THE FIRST-LINE ANTIBIOTIC (CEFTRIAXONE), WHICH IS USED AS THE EMPIRIC TREATMENT OF THIS CONDITION. HOWEVER, THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF MULTIDRUG RESISTANT PATHOGENS CAUSING CUTI DELAYS THE TIME UNTIL PATIENTS RECEIVE MORE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. DELAYED TIME TO APPROPRIATE THERAPY IN CUTI HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO EXTENDED HOSPITAL STAYS AND AN INCREASED RISK OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THE CURRENT STANDARD TEST FOR DIAGNOSING A DRUG-RESISTANT CUTI TAKES 2-3 DAYS FROM OBTAINING A PATIENT SAMPLE. THEREFORE, DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THAT CAN RAPIDLY INFORM THE INITIAL TREATMENT OF UTIS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE II PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A RAPID URINARY DIAGNOSTIC TEST THAT WILL ENABLE THE DETECTION OF CEFTRIAXONE-RESISTANT UROPATHOGENS. EARLY DETECTION OF RESISTANCE TO FIRST-LINE THERAPIES WOULD ENABLE ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIBING TO BE INFORMED, REDUCING THE RISK OF DISEASE PROGRESSION IN PATIENTS. IN THE CASE OF UTIS, DISEASE PROGRESSION CAN LEAD TO SEVERELY INVASIVE INFECTIONS, PREDOMINATELY SEPSIS. THEREFORE, DIAGNOSTICS THAT CAN DETECT RESISTANCE TO FIRST-LINE ANTIBIOTICS ENABLE EARLY TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS, REDUCING THE TIME TO APPROPRIATE TREATMENT AND REDUCING THE RISK OF DISEASE PROGRESSION. DECREASED TREATMENT TIME ALSO LOWERS THE HEALTHCARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG-RESISTANT CUTI, AS DISEASE PROGRESSION IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LENGTHS OF HOSPITAL STAYS COMPARED TO SUSCEPTIBLE INFECTIONS. THE COMPLETION OF THE PHASE II PROJECT WILL YIELD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE TEST THAT CAN PROVIDE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION REGARDING CEFTRIAXONE SUSCEPTIBILITY IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.

RICE IS A FOOD STAPLE FOR MORE THAN 3 BILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE. RICE DISEASES AFFECT RICE PRODUCTION WORLDWIDE, AND AS A RESULT, REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY. AMONG RICE DISEASES, BACTERIAL PANICLE BLIGHT, CAUSED BY THE PATHOGEN BURKHOLDERIA GLUMAE, IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC AS THERE ARE NOT EFFECTIVE METHODS TO CONTROL IT. THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY MAY REDUCE YIELD LOSS TO FARMERS DUE TO THIS DISEASE, WHILE ALSO REDUCING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE AND USE OF ANTIBACTERIAL CHEMICALS THAT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. THIS TECHNOLOGY MAY BENEFIT RICE FARMERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC BACTERIAL DISEASE IN RICE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ITS IMPACT CAN BE EXPANDED TO OTHER CROP DISEASES. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY AND EFFECTIVE SEED COATING TREATMENT TO CONTROL BACTERIAL PANICLE BLIGHT (BPB). PLANT DISEASES CAUSED BY MICROORGANISMS SUCH AS FUNGI AND BACTERIA SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY. TRADITIONALLY, FUNGAL PLANT DISEASES HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED BY SYNTHETIC FUNGICIDES THAT WHILE EFFECTIVE, POSE SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT. IN CONTRAST TO FUNGAL DISEASES, EFFECTIVE METHODS TO CONTROL BACTERIAL DISEASES IN CROPS ARE UNAVAILABLE, MOSTLY BECAUSE THE USE OF SYNTHETIC ANTIBIOTICS IN CROPS CAN INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE CAN BE TRANSMITTED TO HUMAN BACTERIAL PATHOGENS. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO FIND ANTIBACTERIALS EFFECTIVE AGAINST PLANT DISEASES WITHOUT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO HUMAN HEALTH OR THE ENVIRONMENT. BACTERIAL PANICLE BLIGHT (BPB) HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED RICE PRODUCTION WORLDWIDE. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON THE SECRETED FRACTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL BACTERIUM PSEUDOMONAS PROTEGENS STRAIN PBL3. BECAUSE THE P.

THE PRIMARY BENEFACTOR OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS THE BIOMANUFACTURERS AND BIOPROCESSING INTEGRATORS. HOWEVER, THE COST OF GOODS (COGS) SAVINGS PROVIDED TO THE COLLABORATING INDUSTRY PARTNERS COULD BE FAR-REACHING. THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD ENABLE EFFICIENT (AND LOWER COST) PRODUCTION OF LIFESAVING DRUGS AND VACCINES. REDUCING OVERALL COST WILL POTENTIALLY MAKE THESE LIFE-SAVING THERAPEUTICS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE TO ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE UNIQUE, SUSTAINABLE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE MEMBRANE FABRICATION APPROACH OFFERED IN THIS PROPOSAL COULD IMPROVE THE MEMBRANE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY BY PRODUCING MEMBRANES CONTAINING NARROW PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION AND HIGH FOULING RESISTANCE. MANY INDUSTRIES BEYOND BIOPROCESSING STAND TO BENEFIT FROM HIGH-PERFORMANCE MEMBRANES, INCLUDING FOOD AND BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS, WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, AND OTHER MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A VIRUS FILTRATION MEMBRANE USING A SYNTHESIS PROCESS THAT IS MORE SUSTAINABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE THAN THE CONVENTIONAL PROCESS. PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS RELY UPON MEMBRANE ULTRAFILTRATION DUE TO ITS ADVANTAGES OF SCALABILITY, REPLICATION, AND USER EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, MEMBRANE ANTIFOULING CAN HINDER A FULL REALIZATION OF CONTINUOUS BIOPROCESSING PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES. MEMBRANE FOULING CAUSES PROTEIN DEFORMATION AND LOSS, LIMITING MEMBRANE APPLICATIONS FOR EFFICIENT VIRUS/PROTEIN SEPARATION. THE PROPOSED MEMBRANES HAVE A NARROWER PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION AND STRONGER FOULING RESISTANCE WITHOUT USING ANY POST-PRODUCTION PROCESSES. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPOSED MEMBRANE FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY SIMPLIFIES THE MEMBRANE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND REDUCES THE MANUFACTURING COSTS BY ELIMINATING THE USE OF SOLVENTS, ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR SOLVENT RECLAMATION AND RECYCLING.

THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE RESEARCH INCLUDES IMPROVED AVAILABILITY OF NUTRITIOUS FOOD FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION AND MITIGATION OF NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF COLD LOGISTICS. ADDITIONALLY, MITIGATING FOOD WASTE WILL CREATE SAVINGS UP AND DOWN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. TWO KEY TECHNICAL CHALLENGES ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS RESEARCH. THE FIRST AREA HAS, AS ITS MAIN OBJECTIVE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VOLUME-ADAPTABLE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR THE EFFICIENT OPERATION OF SEVERAL LEVELS OF CONTROL TO BEST ADAPT TO HIGH LEVELS OF COOLING CAPACITY NEEDS. THE SECOND AREA OF RESEARCH CORRESPONDS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE METHODOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS ALGORITHMS TO EXERCISE A HYBRID CONTROL STRATEGY FOR THE OPTIMAL SCHEDULING OPERATION OF THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM.

UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING MOLECULAR ISOMERS ARE CUMBERSOME, SLOW, AND INVOLVE TRIAL AND ERROR WORK ? PRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT BOTTLENECK TO REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SEEKS TO PROVIDE A RAPID AND ROBUST INSTRUMENT FOR ISOMER ANALYSIS, DRAMATICALLY REDUCING PHARMACEUTICAL AND AGROCHEMICAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND EXTENDING PATENT EXCLUSIVITY SALES ? WHILE ENABLING THE EXPERIMENTAL IDENTIFICATION OF CONFORMERS FOR THE FIRST TIME. ACCESS TO THIS NEW INFORMATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM AGROCHEMICAL ($220 BILLION TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET (TAM) IN 2022) AND DRUG DISCOVERY ($82 BILLION TAM 2022) SECTORS, WHILE GENERATING NEW WELL-PAYING, HIGH-TECH JOBS. THIS SBIR PHASE I PROJECT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A NOVEL MASS SPECTROMETER THAT WORKS ON NEUTRAL MOLECULES RATHER THAN IONS. IT USES HIGH ELECTRIC FIELDS TO MANIPULATE AND DISTINGUISH MOLECULES, SEPARATING THEM BY THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR ELECTRICAL POLARITY WHICH, IN TURN, IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE MOLECULE?S 3D SHAPE. MOLECULES MAY BE PUSHED OR PULLED BY THE FIELDS DEPENDING ON THEIR ORIENTATIONS IN THE FIELD AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR POLARITY (?DIPOLE MOMENT?). SINCE MOLECULAR ISOMERS WEIGH THE SAME, THEIR IDENTIFICATION VIA MASS SPECTROMETRY IS COMPLICATED AND TYPICALLY REQUIRES TIME-CONSUMING ?METHOD DEVELOPMENT? WORK. THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT AIMS TO REDUCE THIS WORK BY USING DIPOLE MOMENTS TO DISTINGUISH ALL ISOMERS AND THEIR CONFORMERS IN A SINGLE SPECTRUM ? WITH AN AXIS LABELED BY MASS-TO-DIPOLE-MOMENT RATIO, RATHER THAN MASS-TO-CHARGE RATIO. THIS TECHNOLOGY USES MICROFABRICATION TECHNIQUES TO MINIATURIZE AND PLANARIZE A PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED QUADRUPOLE DEVICE DESCRIBED IN THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE, CREATING AN ARRAY OF MICROSCOPIC QUADRUPOLE CHANNELS. THE ADDITIONAL PATENT-PENDING DECELERATION FEATURE, COUPLED WITH VELOCITY SELECTIVE DETECTION, SHOULD RESULT IN 2-TO-3 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER ISOMER/CONFORMER DISCRIMINATION CAPABILITIES OVER THE LITERATURE DEVICE. FINALLY, THIS UNIVERSAL DETECTION METHODOLOGY WILL ALLOW FOR CONTINUOUS THROUGHPUT, WHICH IS IDEAL FOR INTERFACING WITH STANDARD ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTATION.

COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTORS WITH A WIDE BANDGAP ARE NEEDED FOR HIGH POWER DEVICES IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS), HIGH FREQUENCY COMPONENTS IN 5G ELECTRONICS, AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT DISPLAYS. THE COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET, VALUED AT $36+ BILLION IN 2022, HAS INCREASED RECENTLY WITH GROWING CONSUMER DEMAND FOR EVS. THE ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF SILICON CARBIDE (SIC) SEMICONDUCTORS, THE MOST PROMINENT DEVICES, IS ESTIMATED AT OVER 20%. DESPITE THE WIDE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF THESE COMPONENTS IN AN INDUSTRY THAT EXPECTS NEAR PERFECTION IN MANUFACTURING, THE CURRENT YIELD OF POWER ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS IS LESS THAN 50%. POOR YIELD RESULTS LARGELY FROM AN INABILITY TO ADEQUATELY INSPECT SUBSTRATES AND EPITAXIAL WAFERS USED FOR POWER ELECTRONICS. INSTEAD, THE INDUSTRY CURRENTLY RELIES ON INSPECTION TOOLS WITH POOR DEFECT SELECTIVITY OR DESTRUCTIVE METHODS THAT CAN ONLY PROVIDE STATISTICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEFECTS IN A WAFER BATCH. TO INCREASE WAFER YIELD, THE TEAM WILL DEVELOP A NEW TYPE OF OPTICAL INSPECTION TOOL FOR SELECTIVELY MEASURING DEFECTS IN EVERY WAFER. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS NOVEL INSPECTION TECHNOLOGY WILL ENABLE THE INDUSTRY TO HELP DRIVE DOWN COSTS AND INCREASE PERFORMANCE OF ENERGY-EFFICIENT POWER ELECTRONICS. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT IS THE NOVEL WAY IN WHICH TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR USE IN FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE IS BEING APPLIED TO RAPID SEMICONDUCTOR INSPECTION. THE PROPOSED METHOD, CALLED ULTRAFAST IMAGING, USES THE NONLINEAR OPTICAL RESPONSE OF A SEMICONDUCTOR INDUCED BY AN ULTRAFAST LASER TO ISOLATE DEFECTS THAT MEASURABLY IMPACT THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR. THOUGH THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY HAS TYPICALLY FOCUSED ON MEASURING MORPHOLOGY TO FIND DEFECTS, MEASUREMENT OF COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTORS REQUIRES A TOOL THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE. THIS PROJECT WILL VALIDATE ULTRAFAST IMAGING THROUGH BENCHMARK TESTING AGAINST INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND DEVELOP AN EASY-TO-USE DEVICE FOR GETTING THIS TECHNOLOGY INTO THE HANDS OF MANUFACTURERS.

AN IMPORTANT FOCUS WILL BE UNDERSTANDING THE LOWER SURVIVAL RATES IN BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY IN THEIR EARLY, VULNERABLE YEARS. THE PROJECT WILL ANALYZE CAUSES OF RACIAL DIFFERENCES, INCLUDING OWNER HUMAN CAPITAL AND FIRM CHARACTERISTICS, WITH THE KEY HYPOTHESIS THAT TOUGHER FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS FACED BY BLACK ENTREPRENEURS REDUCE THE SURVIVAL RATE OF THEIR FIRMS. THE PROJECT WILL ESTIMATE THE CAUSAL EFFECTS ON FIRM SURVIVAL OF CREDIT PROGRAMS THAT MAY INCREASE FINANCIAL ACCESS FOR BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS. IN THESE WAYS, THE PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING THE RACIAL GAP IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND BUSINESS OWNERSHIP, WHICH IS A CRUCIAL, BUT LITTLE STUDIED COMPONENT OF THE BROADER ISSUE OF RACIAL INEQUALITY. THE PROJECT BRINGS NEW DATA AND METHODS TO ANALYZING THE RACIAL GAP. THE USE OF CENSUS BUREAU MICRO-DATA REPRESENTS AN ADVANCE OVER PREVIOUS WORK, AS MUCH BETTER DATA AT THE FIRM-LEVEL HAVE GRADUALLY BECOME AVAILABLE, AND THE PROJECT WILL KNIT THEM TOGETHER INTO A NEW LONGITUDINAL DATABASE WITH A RICH SET OF VARIABLES ON OWNERS AND FIRMS. THE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES IN FIRM DYNAMICS BY RACE USING A PANEL DATASET HAS LITTLE PRECEDENT AND ALLOWS THE RESEARCH TO FOCUS ON THE KEY OUTCOME OF SURVIVAL IN A WAY THAT IS DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE WITH ONLY A CROSS-SECTION. THE RICH DATA ENABLE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ROLES OF CHARACTERISTICS OF ENTREPRENEURS, INCLUDING THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND CHOICES, IMPACTING SURVIVAL OUTCOMES. THE PROJECT ALSO DEVELOPS INNOVATIVE IDENTIFICATION STRATEGIES, BASED ON PANEL REGRESSION, MATCHING, INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE, AND REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY METHODS, FOR ASSESSING THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS IN FIRM SURVIVAL, EXPLOITING PLAUSIBLY EXOGENOUS VARIATION USING DATA FROM TWO PROGRAMS: THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION?S 7(A) LOAN PROGRAM AND THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT.

THE WIRELESS SENSOR MARKET IS WORTH > $13 BILLION AND IS GROWING 10% ANNUALLY. THERE IS AN UNDER-PENETRATION IN THE MARKET DUE TO THE UNMET NEED OF AN EASY-TO-USE SENSING PLATFORM THAT CAN PROVIDE USERS WITH QUANTITATIVE AND CONTINUOUS DATA ABOUT THEIR STUDIES IN REAL-TIME AS COMPARED TO DISCRETE SAMPLING TECHNIQUES USED CURRENTLY. THIS IS BECAUSE THE CURRENT CONTINUOUS SENSORS ARE EITHER WIRED OR BULKY (DISCRETE WIRELESS), ARE DISRUPTIVE TO THE STUDIES, REQUIRE SPECIAL INSERTION PROCEDURES (E.G., COMPLEX SURGERIES FOR ANIMAL RESEARCH), AND DO NOT EASILY INTEGRATE WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL WORKFLOW. GIVEN OUR EXPERIENCE IN WIRELESS SENSOR DEVELOPMENT FOR DIABETES, MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE ASKED US TO DEVELOP A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY FOR BIOCHEMICAL SENSING TO ENABLE RESEARCH IN MATERIALS SCIENCE, PHARMACEUTICAL, IN VITRO DIAGNOSTICS, PROTEIN ENGINEERING, AND DISEASE PATHWAYS.

THIS TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION IS INTENDED TO CONSERVE PRECIOUS DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES AND REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES FOR BOTH WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND FERTILIZER PRODUCTION. RATHER THAN COMBINING ALL DOMESTIC WASTEWATER INTO ONE DILUTE STREAM, THIS PROJECT SEPARATES AND RECYCLES THE LARGEST SOURCE OF NUTRIENT POLLUTION: TOILET WASTE. SOURCE-SEPARATING BATHROOM FIXTURES (INCLUDING WATERLESS URINALS, URINE-DIVERTING TOILETS, AND VACUUM-FLUSH TOILETS) DIRECT THE WASTE THROUGH DEDICATED PLUMBING TO A COMPACT BUILDING-SCALE PROCESSOR, WHICH CONVERTS IT INTO A PURIFIED LIQUID FERTILIZER.

THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A POINT-OF-USE SOLUTION THAT WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PROVIDING ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER. THESE MATERIALS ARE SAFE FOR DRINKING WATER SINCE THEY ARE BASED ON NATURAL MATERIALS AND POLYMERS ALREADY USED IN WATER PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY. THE PROPSOED PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON (1) OPTIMIZATION OF ION EXCHANGE (IX) MATERIALS, AND (2) SCALING-UP THE PRODUCTION OF THESE MATERIALS TO PILOT SCALE OR HIGHER. OPTIMIZATION OF ADSORPTION CAPACITY, AND WATER FLUX WILL BE DONE WHILE MINIMIZING THE COST OF MANUFACTURING. THE TECHNOLOGY IS A VERY THIN LAYER OF IX RESIN ATTACHED TO A NANOSCALE SUPPORT. THE SUPPORT MATERIAL PROVIDES STRUCTURAL RIGIDITY AND ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR CROSS-LINKING, WHICH LEADS TO DEGRADATION OF THE TRADITIONAL IX MATERIALS. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY INCREASES SURFACE AREA, BINDING SITE ACCESSIBILITY, AND IMPROVES ADSORPTION KINETICS TO MAKE THESE MATERIALS CHEAPER AND MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE COMPETING PRODUCTS. THE POLYMERS ARE PERMANENTLY BOUND TO THE SUPPORT MATERIALS USING CLICK CHEMISTRY TO ENSURE THEIR RETENTION IN THE FILTER MODULES OVER TIME AND WITH REPEATED USE.

CELL CULTURE, IN WHICH SCIENTISTS ATTEMPT TO GROW CELLS IN CONDITIONS LIKE THOSE IN THE BODY, IS ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TECHNIQUES IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. HOWEVER, OXYGEN, A CRITICAL FACTOR FOR CELL BEHAVIOR AND PHYSIOLOGY, IS NOT CONTROLLED DURING STANDARD CELL CULTURES. IN FACT, CELLS IN LABORATORY CELL CULTURE EXPERIENCE UP TO 50-FOLD HIGHER OXYGEN CONCENTRATIONS THAN THEY DO IN THE BODY. BY CHANGING THE STATUS QUO OF CELL CULTURE FROM NON-OXYGEN-CONTROLLED TO OXYGEN-CONTROLLED, THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY CAN ADVANCE THE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF OXYGEN?S ROLE IN DISEASE DEVELOPMENT, BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES, AND HUMAN TISSUES.

HOWEVER, THESE TECHNOLOGIES FACE MANY OBSTACLES, SUCH AS LIMITATIONS IN OPTICAL CLARITY AND RESOLUTION. THE DISPLAY INDUSTRY IS IN URGENT NEED OF NEW INNOVATION THAT CAN ACHIEVE MUCH HIGHER RESOLUTIONS THAN WHAT EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES DELIVER. TO THIS END, THE INDUSTRY IS ACTIVELY INVESTING IN MICRO-LED TECHNOLOGY, WHERE THE PIXEL SIZE NEARS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE REDUCTION FROM THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART. BETTER RESOLUTION IS DESIRABLE ACROSS THE ENTIRE DISPLAY INDUSTRY, RANGING FROM SMARTPHONES/WATCHES TO LARGE PANEL DISPLAYS, BUT MICRO-LEDS WILL BENEFIT CONSUMERS MOST BY TRANSFORMING AR/VR.

DIRECT RESISTANCE-HEATED THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE (DRH-ETS) TECHNOLOGY STORES ELECTRICITY FROM THE GRID, WHICH CAN EITHER BE DIRECTLY UTILIZED FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE INDUSTRIAL HEAT OR EFFICIENTLY CONVERTED BACK TO ELECTRICITY. THIS DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE GLOBAL DECARBONIZATION CHALLENGES OF (1) BALANCING SUPPLY AND DEMAND ON AN ELECTRICAL GRID WITH A HIGH PENETRATION OF RENEWABLES, AND (2) REDUCING INDUSTRIAL DEPENDENCE OF FOSSIL FUELS FOR PRODUCING HIGH-TEMPERATURE INDUSTRIAL HEAT. IN 2021, COMBUSTION OF FOSSIL FUELS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HEAT IN HEAVY INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CEMENT AND STEEL-MAKING ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OF ALL GLOBAL EMISSIONS. YET, THE OPTIONS FOR DECARBONIZING INDUSTRIAL HEAT INPUTS REMAIN VERY LIMITED, WITH MOST BEING COST-PROHIBITIVE AT LARGE SCALE. TRADITIONAL THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES UTILIZING INDIRECT METALLIC HEATING ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS AMONG THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE HEATING OPTIONS BUT CANNOT ACHIEVE HIGH ENOUGH TEMPERATURES TO SUIT MOST CARBON-INTENSIVE PROCESSES. DRH-ETS WILL OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING ELECTRICITY TO DIRECTLY HEAT CONDUCTIVE THERMAL STORAGE MATERIALS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL SCREEN AND DEVELOP MATERIALS THAT OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF DRH-ETS SYSTEMS. WHILE REFRACTORY OXIDE MATERIALS HAVE GOOD OXIDATION RESISTANCE AND CAN BE DOPED FOR ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY, MOST SIMPLE BINARY OXIDES ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY THE COMBINATION OF REQUIRED CHEMICAL, THERMAL, AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES.

HERE, MIXED METAL OXIDES ARE PROMISING, BUT THE RELEVANT PROPERTIES OF MOST HIGHER ORDER MIXTURES ARE NOT READILY KNOWN. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, THIS PROJECT WILL PERFORM COMPUTATIONAL SCREENING OF MATERIALS FOR SINGLE-PHASE STABILITY OVER A LARGE TEMPERATURE RANGE, SMALL RESISTIVITY TEMPERATURE DERIVATIVE, AND DOPABILITY. THE SCREENING WILL EMPLOY A COMBINATION OF THERMOCHEMICAL MODELING, ELECTRONIC BAND STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS, AND AB INITIO DEFECT ANALYSIS TO DOWNSELECT FROM LARGE MULTICOMPONENT COMPOSITIONAL SPACES.

ACROSS THE NATION, SCIENCE ILLITERACY IS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH ONLY 30% OF STUDENTS TESTING AS HAVING A BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE. AS A RESULT, THE U.S. DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH TRAINED SCIENTISTS TO COMMERCIAL OR ACADEMIC LABORATORIES. THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN DEEMED A NATIONAL CRISIS AND IS CONSIDERED A RISK TO U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY. A QUALITY SCIENCE EDUCATION HAS LASTING BENEFITS TO STUDENTS INCLUDING MORE PERSUASIVE AND CLEAR COMMUNICATION SKILLS, AND THE ABILITY TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP CRITICAL APPROACHES TO PROBLEM-SOLVING. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO RAISE SCIENCE LITERACY ACROSS THE NATION AND PROVIDE CAREER READINESS TRAINING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS. THE PROGRAM MEETS ALL THREE DIMENSIONS OF NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS. A BOOK VERSION OF THE PROGRAM IS BEING ROLLED-OUT TO INDEPENDENT STUDY CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. THE ONLINE PROGRAM WILL BE TESTED IN SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE ADOPTED THE BOOKS. BOTH BOOK AND ONLINE VERSIONS WILL BE EXPANDED TO CHARTER SCHOOLS, PRIVATE SCHOOLS, AND EVENTUALLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

THE PROPOSED NEW APPROACH NEGATES THE NEED FOR WATER IN THE DRILLING PROCESS, THEREBY MITIGATING THE RISK OF POLLUTION TO PUBLIC AND WILDLIFE DRINKING WATER SOURCES. REDUCING THE TIME REQUIRED FOR A TYPICAL DRILLING PROJECT FROM WEEKS TO DAYS REDUCES THE CARBON EMISSION FROM THE ENERGY-INTENSIVE DRILLING EQUIPMENT REQUIRED. THIS SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRING SUBSURFACE DATA WITH TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES HAS AN ADDRESSABLE MARKET SEGMENT VALUE OF $21 BILLION. THE NEW INSTRUMENT TO BE DEVELOPED WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR OFF-SITE LAB SERVICES, CORE DRILLING, AND SITE GEOLOGISTS, RESULTING IN LOWER INDUSTRY LIFE CYCLE COSTS AND SPURRING CRITICAL EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES FOR NEEDED US STRATEGIC MINERALS. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT IS BASED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL DRILLING MODULE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE SUBSURFACE CHEMISTRY AND GEOTECHNICAL PROPERTIES OF ROCKS AND SOILS, TO ASSESS THE TYPE AND VALUE OF MINERALS PRESENT BOTH QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY. THE CONVENTIONAL WAY OF EVALUATING THESE MATERIALS IS BY CORE DRILLING, WHICH PRESENTS VARIOUS PROBLEMS RELATED TO COST, SAMPLE QUALITY AND LOGISTICS. THIS RESEARCH USES A COMBINATION OF OPTICAL IMAGES, X-RAY FLUORESCENCE, AND GAMMA-RAY DENSITY, AS WELL AS COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH DATA FROM A NEWLY CURATED DATABASE THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED FROM OPEN-SOURCE GEOSPATIAL DATA, COLLECTIONS OF GEOLOGY AND GEOTECHNICAL REPORTS, ROCK CORE DATABASES, IMPLICIT GEOLOGY MODELING PRINCIPLES, AND MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO CHARACTERIZE ROCK AND SOIL SAMPLES.

APPROXIMATELY 3.5 MILLION AMERICAN CHILDREN AND ADULTS HAVE A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM. ASD IS CONSIDERED A LIFELONG PERVASIVE DISORDER AND, WITHOUT PROPER TREATMENT, INDIVIDUALS WITH ASD MAY HAVE CHALLENGES FUNCTIONING IN SOCIETY. THE COST TO TREAT AN INDIVIDUAL WITH AUTISM IS APPROXIMATELY $50,000 PER YEAR, ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, AND IN ALL 50 STATES, BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE MANDATED TO PAY FOR APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS THERAPY DELIVERED BY BOARD-CERTIFIED ANALYSTS. HOWEVER, SINCE THE TYPICAL MODEL FOR DELIVERING THERAPY IS EITHER HOME-BASED OR CLINIC-BASED, MANY SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF U.S. CITIZENS CANNOT ACCESS THERAPY. PATIENTS WHO LIVE IN REMOTE AREAS, DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION, OR NEED TREATMENT OUTSIDE OF NORMAL WORK HOURS ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS TREATMENT.

DESPITE MODERN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND CHEMISTRY IMPROVEMENTS, ALMOST 40% OF ALL CROP PRODUCTION IS LOST DUE TO PESTS AND PATHOGENS EACH YEAR; WITHIN THE U.S. OVER 25% OF SOYBEAN PRODUCTION IS LOST THIS WAY. THESE LOSSES ARE EVEN MORE SEVERE IN REGIONS WHERE PESTICIDE APPLICATION IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FOR FARMERS. THIS PROJECT DEVELOPS A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN SOYBEAN AND OTHER OILSEED CROPS TO PROTECT AGAINST PLANT DISEASE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A BROAD-SPECTRUM PATHOGEN RESISTANCE TRAIT. WHILE THE FIRST GENERATION OF TRANSGENIC TRAIT TECHNOLOGIES CONFERRING HERBICIDE TOLERANCE AND INSECTICIDAL TRAITS HAVE BEEN READILY ESTABLISHED FOR OILSEED PRODUCTION ACROSS NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, FURTHER DEVELOPMENT HAS FALTERED DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE PLANT TRAITS.

THE TECHNOLOGY UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS A ROOF-MOUNTED, PANELIZED ARRAY THAT PROVIDES SOLAR HEAT DURING THE DAY AND RADIATIVELY COOLS AT NIGHT. THE TECHNOLOGY MAY BE ABLE TO SUPPLY BUILDING ENERGY RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, A DISRUPTIVE CAPABILITY FOR A ROOFTOP CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTION. THE LOW COST AND RENEWABLE NATURE OF THIS RESOURCE MAY ALSO INSURE THAT BUILDING OWNERS AND RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO CARBON-FREE ENERGY THAT IS LESS EXPENSIVE, LESS VOLATILE, AND MORE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF INTERRUPTIONS TO ENERGY SUPPLIED FROM CONVENTIONAL GAS AND GRID SOURCES. THIS SBIR PHASE II PROJECT SEEKS TO VALIDATE A PANELIZED ROOFTOP TECHNOLOGY TO RENEWABLY GENERATE HEATING AND COOLING RESOURCES FOR BUILDINGS. DOMINANT SOLUTIONS COMBUST FUEL FOR HEAT AND USE GRID ELECTRICITY TO POWER VAPOR COMPRESSION FOR COOLING. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION DESCRIBES AN ARRAY OF THERMAL PANES THAT CONVERT A ROOF INTO AN ACTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL INTERFACE THAT CONTINUALLY OPTIMIZES THE EXTRACTION AND REJECTION OF HEAT VIA ABSORPTIVE, RADIATIVE, AND CONVECTIVE PROCESSES. THE TECHNOLOGY CONTINUALLY OPERATES IN RESPONSE TO BUILDING ENERGY NEEDS. BY MODULATING PANE THERMO-OPTIC PROPERTIES THE SOLUTION ENABLES FLUID FLOW TO ALTER THE INTERNAL OPTICAL AND HEAT TRANSFER CONFIGURATION. EVALUATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BEGIN WITH MANUFACTURING PROTOTYPES THAT INCORPORATE NOVEL THERMAL BONDING TECHNIQUES FOR INTEGRATING FOAMED POLYISO-, FLUORO-, AND POLY-OLEFIN POLYMERS. A SOLAR SIMULATOR WILL ASSESS EFFICIENCY AND OUTPUT TEMPERATURES, AN ITERATIVE PROCESS TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF INTERNAL FLUID FLOWS, VISBLE AND INFRARED RADIATION PATHS, AND THERMAL LOSS MECHANISMS. AN ARRAY WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY DEPLOYED ON A ROOFTOP AND COUPLED TO THE BUILDING ENERGY SYSTEM. DATA WILL BE COLLECTED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND OVERALL HEATING/COOLING WHILE DEVELOPING CONTROL ALGORITHMS FOR PANE MODULATION.

MELTDOWNS ARE HIGHLY DISTRESSING EVENTS FOR THESE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES AND MAY REQUIRE INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM BY PROACTIVELY DETECTING MELTDOWNS WILL ALLOW CAREGIVERS TIME TO INTERVENE, MITIGATE, AND PREVENT THE ONSET OF DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIORAL EPISODES. THE ABILITY TO PREDICT A MELTDOWN, AND THEN IMPLEMENT STRATEGIC INTERVENTION TO PREVENT THE MELTDOWN, MAY HAVE POSITIVE LIFE-CHANGING EFFECTS FOR THE CHILDREN, THEIR FAMILIES, AND THEIR CARETAKES BY REDUCING SOCIAL STIGMA, ENABLING MORE MAINSTREAMING OF SCHOOL AND FAMILY ACTIVITIES, AND REDUCING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HEALTHCARE BURDENS. THIS TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO BE USED TO MITIGATE PANIC ATTACKS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDERS. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE I PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A WEARABLE DEVICE THAT DETECTS, PREDICTS, AND HELPS PREVENT MELTDOWNS IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. WEARABLE DEVICES THAT MEASURE PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET, BUT NONE OF THEM ARE SPECIFIC TO AUTISM, AND NONE OF THEM PROACTIVELY PREDICT BEHAVIOR EPISODES. A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THIS WEARABLE DEVICE IS THAT IT USES MACHINE LEARNING TO PREDICT MELTDOWNS. INCORPORATING MACHINE LEARNING ALLOWS EACH DEVICE TO LEARN THE UNIQUE BIOMETRIC SIGNATURE OF THE WEARER SO IT CAN PREDICT MELTDOWNS WITH HIGH ACCURACY. WHEN A CHILD IS AT HIGH RISK FOR A MELTDOWN, THE DEVICE WILL DETECT THE RELEVANT PHYSIOLOGY AND ALERT CAREGIVERS AND THERAPISTS IN TIME TO INTERVENE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO CREATE A PROTOTYPE WHICH INCLUDES THE WEARABLE PRODUCT AND THE INDIVIDUALIZATION ENABLED BY MACHINE LEARNING TO CORRELATE A CHILD?S BIOMETRIC MEASURES WITH BEHAVIORAL STATES. THE GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE DECREASED FREQUENCY AND/OR SEVERITY OF MELTDOWNS. BY ENABLING CAREGIVERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM TO TAKE CONTROL OF AND PREVENT MELTDOWNS, THIS PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ELIMINATE THE STIGMA THESE CHILDREN FACE DURING A MELTDOWN IN PUBLIC, AND EMPOWERS THE CHILDREN TO BECOME MORE INDEPENDENT AS THEY AGE.

THE PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENT USES THZ REFLECTIVE IMAGING PHENOMENOLOGY, A TECHNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO EFFICIENTLY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HEALTHY AND DISEASED TISSUES. WITH A RESOLUTION OF MORE THAN 300X300 PIXELS, OPERATION AT BETWEEN 10-30 FRAMES PER SECOND, AND A COMPACT FORM FACTOR, THE SYSTEM IS APPROPRIATE FOR MEDICAL ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS CANCER SURGERIES, INCLUDING GLIOBLASTOMA RESECTION. THE THZ CAMERA WILL BE A NEW ADDITION TO THE MEDICAL IMAGING MARKET THAT HAS MATURED WITH X-RAY, MRI, VISIBLE AND INFRARED TECHNOLOGIES TO REACH $45 BILLION. THIS NEW INSTRUMENT IS ENABLED BY A LARGE FORMAT SENSOR ARRAY THAT USES A LOW-COST MANUFACTURING PROCESS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED IN A HIGH-VOLUME FOUNDRY. IN ADDITION TO THE MEDICAL APPLICATION, SIMILAR IMAGING SYSTEMS CAN BE USED IN SECURITY SCREENING APPLICATIONS ($2 BILLION MARKET/YEAR) SUCH AS PASSENGER SCREENING AT AIRPORTS. MORE BROADLY, THE UNDERLYING SENSOR TECHNOLOGY CAN BE ADAPTED FOR USE ACROSS THE EXTREMELY WIDE THZ SPECTRUM, WHICH HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR MANY INDUSTRIES. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT IS PRIMARILY ITS INTEGRATION OF BOTH HIGH RESOLUTION AND HIGH-SPEED ASPECTS OF THZ IMAGING, AS THESE CAPABILITIES HAVE NOT YET BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FORM. PREVIOUS DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE EITHER INVOLVED SLOW SCANNING SYSTEMS THAT PRECLUDE REAL TIME APPLICATIONS OR CAMERAS THAT TARGET MUCH HIGHER BANDS OF THE THZ SPECTRUM. THE LATTER RESTRICTION STEMS FROM AN INABILITY TO MANUFACTURE ARRAYS OF LARGE PIXELS TO IMAGE AT THE LONGER THZ WAVELENGTHS. GOING BEYOND ONE OF A KIND LABORATORY PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPERIMENTS, THE THZ CAMERA SEEKS TO PROVIDE RESOLUTION AND FRAME UPDATE RATES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO ACTUAL APPLICATIONS. THE COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING VIABILITY OF THE SENSING ELEMENT MAY ENSURE THAT APPLICATIONS BEYOND THE INITIAL MEDICAL MARKET WILL BE PRACTICAL. THE CAMERA WILL FEATURE NOT ONLY THE HIGH-RESOLUTION THZ IMAGING NEAR THE 250-350 GHZ SPECTRUM BUT ALSO INCORPORATE HIGH-RESOLUTION VISIBLE AND NEAR-INFRARED CAMERAS THAT CAN COMPLEMENT THE THZ VIDEO, WITH TRIALS BEING PLANNED FOR HOSPITAL USAGE. IN ADDITION TO CLINICAL USAGE SCENARIOS, THE IMAGING SYSTEM CAN BE ADAPTED FOR USE IN AIRPORT SECURITY AND OTHER SCREENING APPLICATIONS, AS PORTABILITY AND EASE OF USE WILL GUIDE THE DEMONSTRATION SYSTEM DESIGN.

BOILERS, BAKING OVENS, FURNACES, PROOFERS, HVAC SYSTEMS) THAT EMIT WET EXHAUST INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. BREAD BAKING MARKET SEGMENT ALONE MAY SAVE OVER 50 MILLION THERMS OF ENERGY AND OVER 400 MILLION GALLONS OF WATER ANNUALLY WITH THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL CREATE A NEW CLASS OF HIGH-EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR ENERGY RECOVERY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT. THIS SBIR PHASE I PROJECT DEVELOPS A UNIQUE ENERGY TRANSFER CONCEPT FOR HIGH-EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE PHASE-CHANGE ENERGY CONVERSION. STATE-OF-THE-ART HEAT EXCHANGE PROCESSES USE LINEAR HEAT TRANSFER MECHANISMS. IN CONTRAST, THE PROPOSED APPROACH ACCOUNTS FOR THE NON-LINEAR HEAT DISTRIBUTION DURING THE CONDENSATION PROCESS. AS A RESULT, THE MASS OF PARTIALLY CONDENSED MIXTURE CHANGES ALONG THE FLOW CHANNEL, AND THUS CAUSES A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN LOCAL DEW POINT. THIS APPROACH DEFINES A DESIGN CONFIGURATION FOR EFFICIENT CAPTURE AND MAXIMAL RECOVERY OF LATENT ENERGY FROM THE WET GAS FLOW. THE PROPOSED CONCEPT SUCCESSFULLY EXPLOITS THE THERMO-FLUID ADVANTAGES OF SPIRAL CHANNELS AND THERMOSIPHONS. THE PROJECT WILL RESOLVE KEY TECHNOLOGICAL GAPS AND ADDRESS ISSUES INCLUDING CONDENSATION SUSTAINABILITY AT VARIABLE CHANNEL GEOMETRY AND CHANGING FLOW PARAMETERS, AND THE THERMOSIPHON?S OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE AT UNCONVENTIONAL CONDITIONS.

VOLATILE ORGANICS -THE BROADER IMPACT OF THIS PARTNERSHIPS FOR INNOVATION (MID-CAREER ADVANCEMENT) (PFI (MCA)) PROPOSAL IS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE DURABILITY. THE RESEARCH IS MOTIVATED BY RECENT INSIGHTS ON EMISSIONS OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND OZONE PRECURSORS DURING THE LIFETIME OF ASPHALT-SURFACED AREAS (E.G., ROADS, ROOFS BRIDGE DECKS, ETC.). THIS PROJECT WILL ENGINEER FUNCTIONALIZED CARBON FROM BIOWASTE TO REMOVE OZONE PRECURSORS EMITTED FROM PAVEMENTS. THE FUNCTIONALIZED CARBON WILL BE MADE VIA THERMOCHEMICAL CONVERSION OF A COMBINED FEEDSTOCK OF FOOD WASTE AND ALGAL BIOMASS. COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATIONS, MACHINE LEARNING, OPTIMIZATION, AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WILL BE COMBINED TO DETERMINE THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS CONTROLLING ADSORPTION OF KNOWN GASES INTO FUNCTIONALIZED CARBON. THIS FUNCTIONALIZED CARBON WILL BE INTRODUCED TO BITUMINOUS COMPOSITES TO INCREASE THE RETENTION OF COMPOUNDS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE RELEASED TO THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE. THE STUDY PRESENTS A NEW VISION WHERE OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION ELEMENTS CAN POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. THE PROPOSED INTERVENTION IS DESIGNED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ENHANCE THE DURABILITY OF OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION ELEMENTS AND THE QUALITY OF SURROUNDING AIR BY RETAINING COMPOUNDS THAT OTHERWISE LEAVE BITUMEN AND ENTER THE AIR, WITH SOME SERVING AS OZONE PRECURSORS, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING AIR QUALITY AND HUMAN HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE PROJECT INVOLVING MINORITY GRADUATE STUDENTS IN EDUCATION, OUTREACH ACTIVITIES, AND CUTTING-EDGE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE USE OF TWO WASTE STREAMS (ALGAL BIOFUELS AND FOOD WASTE) TO ADDRESS OZONE CONCERNS WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND EXTENDING THE SERVICE LIFE OF OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION UNDERGOING INTENSE ULTRAVIOLET (UV) LIGHT EXPOSURE. THIS PROJECT WILL INTEGRATE COMPUTATIONAL MODELING AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR THE DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF FUNCTIONALIZED CARBON WITH DESIRABLE RETENTION CHARACTERISTICS FOR SELECT BITUMEN COMPOUNDS. IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THAT AGING IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE LOSS OF ALKANE AND AROMATIC COMPOUNDS IN BITUMEN, SO RETENTION OF THE LATTER COMPOUNDS VIA FUNCTIONALIZED CARBON IS EXPECTED TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE AIR QUALITY BUT ALSO DELAY THE AGING OF BITUMINOUS COMPOSITES, ESPECIALLY THOSE USED IN OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION THAT ARE SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS DEGREES OF UV EXPOSURE, DEPENDING ON THEIR LOCATION. THIS PROPOSAL MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE CONSERVATION WHILE PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH WITHIN A BIO-MASS VALUE CHAIN WHERE WASTE FROM ALGAL BIOFUEL AND FOOD IS CONVERTED INTO VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS.

THIS PROJECT INNOVATION PROPOSES BRINGING CARE TO CHILDREN AT THE ONSET OF NEED USING CHATBOT COMPANIONS TAILORED DELIBERATELY AND PRECISELY TO EACH CHILD?S MENTAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS. OPTIONALLY, A CHILD CAN BE PAIRED WITH LIVE CHAT THERAPISTS AND COACHES NO MATTER WHERE THE CHILD IS ? AT HOME, SCHOOL, OR WHEN ON THEIR OWN. THE SYSTEM LEVERAGES PROVEN MOBILE DEVICE-ACCESSED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES IN TANDEM WITH MACHINE LEARNING (ML)-ENABLED TECHNOLOGIES THAT LEARN FROM A VARIETY OF INTERACTIONS WITH THE CHILD TO DETECT AND DIGITALLY TRIAGE THEIR EXPERIENCES OF LONELINESS, ANGER, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION AND TO ALERT ADULTS WHEN INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ARE DEEMED NECESSARY. WITHOUT APPROPRIATE CARE, THESE SYMPTOMS FREQUENTLY INCREASE IN SEVERITY OVER TIME AND BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO TREAT. INTERVENING EARLY CAN HELP SLOW OR HALT MENTAL ILLNESS, REDUCING FOR PARENTS, SCHOOLS, AND SOCIETY THE PRACTICAL AND FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH REACTIVE, GENERALIZED MENTAL HEALTHCARE TREATMENTS WHILE NURTURING CHILDREN INTO HAPPIER, HEALTHIER ADULTS. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE I PROJECT SEEKS TO BUILD A SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND SEVERITY OF A CHILD?S MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THROUGH REAL-TIME, EARLY DETECTION. RESEARCH REVEALS CHILDREN FACE MORE BARRIERS THAN ADULTS WHEN OBTAINING MENTAL HEALTHCARE, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL, MARGINALIZED, AND LOW-SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS COMMUNITIES. DUE TO A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF CHILD BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, CHILDREN FREQUENTLY WAIT UP TO A DECADE BETWEEN THE ONSET OF MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ELIMINATE THE DELAY BETWEEN WHEN CHILDREN FIRST EXPERIENCE MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL NEEDS AND WHEN THEY RECEIVE APPROPRIATE CARE, ENSURING THEY FLOURISH?NOT FLOUNDER?DURING THOSE CRUCIAL DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS. LEVERAGING ML ALGORITHMS AND PROPRIETARY QUESTION WEIGHTING, THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON: 1) ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMBINATION OF CHATBOT AND LIVE CHAT COUNSELOR ENGAGEMENTS TO UNDERSTAND A CHILD?S IMMEDIATE ISSUES AND PROVIDE RESOLUTIONS FOR THE CHILD AND THEIR PARENT(S); 2) IMPROVEMENTS TO ENSURE THE RESPONSES ARE FIT FOR PURPOSE, RECOGNIZING AND FLAGGING APPROPRIATE CONVERSATIONS FOR HUMAN INTERACTION; AND 3) REFINING THE FREQUENCY AND CONTENT OF NOTIFICATIONS; SUCH AS, ADAPTIVE MOTIVATIONAL MESSAGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO COUNSELORS FOR TAILORING INTERACTIONS.

THE INNOVATION ADDRESSES A CRITICAL GLOBAL NEED TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND ANALYTICS OF BIOPSIES. AN AUTOMATED, RAPID ON-SITE EVALUATION (ROSE) SYSTEM WILL POTENTIALLY ELIMINATE THE 20% FAIL-RATE OF FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION (FNA) BIOPSY SAMPLING. THE APPLICATION MAY ALSO BE SCALED TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO FACILITIES THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE RAPID ONSITE EVALUATION SERVICE OF FNA. THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO PROVIDE AN AUTOMATED, RAPID ON-SITE EVALUATION PROCESS BY LEVERAGING A SYSTEM-ENGAGING TECHNOLOGY AND ROBOTICS TO INCREASE FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY SAMPLING EFFICIENCY AND IMPROVE PATIENT EXPERIENCE, WHILE REDUCING COSTS TO ENSURE ACCESSIBILITY TO ALL FACILITIES. THIS DEVICE WILL HAVE THREE PROCESSES TO PRODUCE AN IMAGE-READY GLASS SLIDE THAT A PATHOLOGIST CAN ACCESS REMOTELY AND RENDER AN ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT. THE DEVICE WILL PERFORM SMEARING, STAINING, AND IMAGE CAPTURE OF A FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY SAMPLE. NORMALLY, THESE PROCESSES ARE PERFORMED BY A PATHOLOGIST/CYTOTECHNOLOGIST, MAKING RAPID ON-SITE EVALUATION SERVICE INACCESSIBLE TO FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION PROVIDERS IN MOST RURAL OR SMALL FACILITIES.

THE CURRENT ANTIFOULING METHODS ARE HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT (TOXIC PAINTS ARE EMPLOYED AND THEY CAN POLLUTE WATERWAYS) AND COSTLY IN TERMS OF MAINTENANCE TO MITIGATE BIOFOULING AND THE INCREASED FUEL COSTS DUE TO FRICTIONAL DRAG DURING A VESSEL?S OPERATION. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE, ELECTRONIC APPROACH TO BIOFOULING PREVENTION BY DEVELOPING ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCER ARRAYS THAT ARE OPTIMIZED FOR SUBMERGED OPERATION IN A MARINA. THE NEAR-TERM COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY IS WITH BOTH MARINA OWNERS AND NATIONWIDE MARINA OPERATORS. OVER TIME AND WITH FURTHER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT AND LARGE NAVY VESSELS MAY ALSO BE ADDRESSED. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF ACOUSTIC WAVE GENERATION IN WATER USING PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS AND SENSOR ARRAYS ALONG WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE WAVES PREVENT THE ATTACHMENT OF BIO-SPECIES TO SHIP HULLS. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PHASE II PROJECT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENT OF TRANSDUCER AND SENSOR ARRAYS TO PREVENT BIOFOULING OF SHIPS DOCKED IN MARINAS. THE PROGRAM HAS FOUR SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES: 1) IMPROVE TRANSDUCER AND POWER AMPLIFIER COMPONENTS AND CONSTRUCTION TO MAXIMIZE SOUND PRESSURE LEVELS IN WATER; 2) DEVELOP AND CONSTRUCT COMPLEX COHERENT TRANSDUCER ARRAYS TO PROJECT ADEQUATE SOUND PRESSURE LEVELS AT DISTANCES GREATER THAN 10 FEET TO PREVENT BIOFOULING AGENTS FROM ATTACHING TO SHIPS; 3) INTEGRATE SENSOR ARRAYS INTO AN AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM THAT CAN ADJUST SOUND PRESSURE LEVELS BASED ON FEEDBACK ALGORITHMS; AND 4) DEVELOP A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SYSTEM TO ADOPT AN AUTONOMOUS, ELECTRONICALLY STEERABLE TRANSDUCER ARRAY SYSTEM TO THE INTERIOR OF BOAT HULLS. THIS LATTER ADAPTATION MAY OPEN MARKETS WHERE LARGE SHIPS SUCH AS COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT AND NAVAL VESSELS CAN BE ADDRESSED.

BROADER IMPACT/COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PROJECT IS THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF AN AQUEOUS LITHIUM AND ZINC ION BATTERY THAT IS A REPLACEMENT FOR LEAD-ACID AND LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES IN STATIONARY ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONS. THIS BATTERY HAS A NONFLAMMABLE, ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY, WATER-BASED ELECTROLYTE AND DOES NOT UTILIZE COBALT OR NICKEL, REDUCING RELIANCE ON CRITICAL MATERIALS AND HELPING TO DIVERSIFY BATTERY MATERIAL SUPPLY CHAINS. THE BATTERY CHEMISTRY COMBINES THE HIGH SAFETY AND LOW COST ASSOCIATED WITH ZINC-BASED BATTERIES WITH THE LONG LIFE OF LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES. THIS AQUEOUS BATTERY MAY HELP TO ADVANCE THE ADOPTION OF BENEFICIAL ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS INTERMITTENT RENEWABLES AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE BATTERY UTILIZES ZINC THAT CAN BE SOURCED DOMESTICALLY AND DOES NOT INTRODUCE A DEPENDENCY ON FOREIGN SOURCES, PROMOTING BOTH NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE CREATION OF US-BASED JOBS. THE BATTERY IS ALSO FULLY RECYCLABLE USING EXISTING METHODS. THIS SBIR PHASE II PROJECT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP THE AQUEOUS LITHIUM AND ZINC ION BATTERY TECHNOLOGY BY FOCUSING ON OPTIMIZATION OF INDIVIDUAL BATTERY COMPONENTS TO IMPROVE CYCLE LIFE AND POWER AS WELL AS SCALE UP FROM POUCH CELLS TO LARGER-FORMAT PRISMATIC CELLS. THE RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE REFINING THE INTERCALATION ELECTRODE DESIGN TO INCREASE CAPACITY RETENTION DURING LONG LIFE CYCLING, DEVELOPING THE ZINC ELECTRODE DESIGN TO SUPPRESS ZINC DENDRITE GROWTH, IMPROVING SEPARATOR FUNCTIONALITY TO MAINTAIN HIGH-RATE CAPABILITIES AND INCREASE CYCLE LIFE, AND DEVELOPING AN ELECTROLYTE DESIGNED TO STABILIZE ZINC WHILE ALSO ALLOWING FOR FASTER REACTIVITY WITH THE ZINC AND LITHIUM IONS. LARGER FORMAT CELLS WITH OPTIMIZED COMPONENTS WILL BE BUILT AND TESTED TO EVALUATE SCALED REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE METRICS COMPARED TO LEAD-ACID AND LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES TRADITIONALLY USED IN STATIONARY ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONS.
