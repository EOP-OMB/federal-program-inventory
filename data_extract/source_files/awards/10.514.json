DIETS, FOR THE MOST PART, ARE HIGH IN ENERGY AND FAT\u2014ESPECIALLY SATURATED FAT, REFINED CARBOHYDRATES, AND SALT AND LOW IN DIETARY FIBER AND ANTIOXIDANTS WHICH ARE READILY AVAILABLE IN FRUITS, VEGETABLES, NUTS, AND SEEDS. AS MORE PEOPLE BECOME AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE, WE ARE SLOWLY SEEING MORE HEALTH-CONSCIOUS INDIVIDUALS BECOMING MORE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE. THE PRICE OF CIGARETTES CONTINUES TO INCREASE AND TIME WILL TELL WHETHER THIS WILL AFFECT OVERALL SMOKING RATES. THESE AND OTHER RISK FACTORS, ARE HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED PREVALENCE OF OBESITY, HYPERTENSION, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, TYPE 2 DIABETES, AND CANCER. OUR GOAL WILL BE TO TARGET THE LOW-INCOME POPULATION TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR HEALTHY DIETS AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLES TO HOPEFULLY DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY IN OUR TERRITORY. INCREASE AT LEAST 50% OF THE PROPORTION OF EFNEP OUTREACH TO PARTICIPANTS OF LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WITH RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION. SOME STRATEGIES WE INTEND TO IMPLEMENT IN THE HOMES WILL BE TO DEVELOP RECIPES USING LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCE AND TO TEST THEM IN THE HOMES. RECIPES HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED WITH THE RATIONALE  THAT IF MORE FRESH VEGETABLES ARE READILY AVAILABLE, MORE WILL BE USED IN HOME MEALS. IF MORE FAMILIES BEGIN TO COOK MORE VEGETABLES AT HOME, THIS WILL LEAD TO A HIGHER INTAKE, WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF MORE FAMILIES. EXPAND NUTRITION EDUCATION TO THE LOW-INCOME, FINANCIALLY-RESOURCED SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY. INCREASE BY 50% THE PROPORTION OF LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WHO PROVIDE MEALS WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TO THEIR CHILDREN AT THE MAIN MEAL.

EFNEP STAFF WILL ALSO USE THE INPUT OF ITS CLIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS TO HELP IMPROVE THE PROGRAM. SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES: EFNEP WILL ASSIST PARTICIPANTS TO LEARN, CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIORS, AND TO GROW AND EXPERIENCE A FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND POSITIVE SELF-ESTEEM. INADEQUATE FOOD SAFETY KNOWLEDGE AND POOR SANITATION PRACTICES OF FOOD HANDLERS ARE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY THERE ARE MANY FOODBORNE ILLNESS CASES HERE EACH YEAR. PREGNANT WOMEN, CHILDREN, OLDER ADULTS, AND PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AND CANCER ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. AS THE NUMBER OF SINGLE-PARENT AND DUAL-INCOME FAMILIES INCREASES IN AMERICAN SAMOA, MORE AND MORE CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING CARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN HOMES AND THIS INCREASES THE NEED FOR HELPFUL INFORMATION SO THAT PARENTS AND FAMILIES CAN BETTER CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO DIET QUALITY AND FOOD SAFETY. GOALS INCLUDE INCREASING FOOD SAFETY KNOWLEDGE AND THE ADOPTION OF SAFE FOOD HANDLING PRACTICES, WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY DECREASE THE PROBABILITY OF LOW-INCOME RESOURCED FAMILIES OF BECOMING SICK FROM FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. THE STRATEGY IS TO EDUCATE AND CONDUCT FOOD SAFETY AND NUTRITION OUTREACH PROGRAMS IN THE C OMMUNITY. DUE TO THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, OUR STRATEGY WILL INCLUDE USING SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE IT IS AN INDISPENSABLE OUTREACH TOOL. THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT NUTRITION AND FOOD SAFETY WORKSHOPS FOR YOUTH AND FAMILIES THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOLS, YOUTH GROUPS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AND NON-PROFIT AGENCIES.

IDAHO\u2019S EFNEP PROGRAM TARGETS COUNTIES WITH HIGH POPULATION AND SNAP USAGE TO ASSIST LIMITED- RESOURCE FAMILIES AND YOUTH TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ATTITUDES TO IMPROVE DIET AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF TOTAL FAMILY HEALTH. THE LOCATION OF SNAP RECIPIENTS IN IDAHO CLOSELY CORRESPONDS TO COUNTY POPULATION, WITH OVER 75% OF IDAHO\u2019S SNAP PARTICIPANTS RESIDING IN THE TEN MOST POPULOUS COUNTIES (ADA, CANYON, KOOTENAI, BONNEVILLE, BANNOCK, TWIN FALLS, BINGHAM, BONNER, NEZ PERCE, AND LATAH). THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS RECEIVING SNAP BENEFITS VARIES GREATLY AMONG THESE TEN COUNTIES, RANGING FROM A LOW OF 5.36% IN LATAH COUNTY TO 13.09% IN CANYON COUNTY, WITH A STATE AVERAGE OF 9.04%. EVEN AMONG THESE POPULOUS COUNTIES, THERE ARE RURAL AREAS, RANGING FROM 5% OF ADA COUNTY CLASSIFIED AS RURAL TO 28% OF TWIN FALLS COUNTY. OVERALL IN IDAHO, 29.4% OF THE POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS, WITH 12 COUNTIES IDENTIFIED AS 100% OF THE POPULATION LIVING IN A RURAL AREA.  TWO-THIRDS OF IDAHO ADULTS AND 30% OF YOUTH ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE, INCREASING RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASE. WHILE HEALTHY DIET AND REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DECREASE ODDS OF OBESITY-RELATED DISEASES, ONE IN SIX CHILDREN AND 12.3% OF IDAHOANS OVERALL EXPERIENCE HUNGER OR FOOD INSECURITY DUE TO A LACK OF MONEY OR RESOURCES. STRATIFIED BY INCOME, IDAHOANS IN THE LOWEST INCOME BRACKETS REPORT THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE AND LOW PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. NON-HISPANIC WHITES REPORT CONSUMING LESS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES COMPARED TO HISPANICS AND AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVES. IN 2015, IDAHO YOUTH REPORTED CONSUMING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES LESS OFTEN THAN IN 2013, WITH NON-HISPANIC WHITE ADOLESCENTS REPORTING CONSUMING FRUIT LESS OFTEN THAN HISPANIC WHITES AND HISPANIC ADOLESCENTS REPORTING CONSUMING VEGETABLES LESS OFTEN THAN NON-HISPANIC WHITES. WHILE IDAHO ADULTS REPORT BEING SLIGHTLY MORE ACTIVE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, THOSE IN THE LOWEST INCOME BRACKETS STILL REPORT LOW LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, WITH HISPANICS AND AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVES REPORTING THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF PHYSICAL INACTIVITY. IDAHO YOUTH REPORT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. HOWEVER, THE PERCENT OF ADOLESCENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN DAILY PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN IDAHO WAS 21.4% IN 2013 COMPARED TO 29.8% NATIONWIDE. FURTHERMORE, AS OF 2012, IDAHO WAS NOT AMONG THE STATES THAT PROVIDE STATE GUIDANCE ON POLICY FOR JOINT USE OF SCHOOL FACILITIES, POLICIES FOR SCHOOL RECESS, OR POLICIES FOR WALKING/BIKING TO/FROM SCHOOL.  INTENDED BENEFICIARIES (TARGET AUDIENCE): IDAHO EFNEP WILL CONTINUE REACHING LOW- INCOME FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS WITH AND RECRUITING AT NUMEROUS COMMUNITY AGENCIES AND GROUPS THAT SERVE LIMITED RESOURCE FAMILIES. OUR GOALS CONTINUE FOR INCREASED REFERRALS AT HEALTH AND WELFARE OFFICES, PUBLIC HOUSING FACILITIES, SHELTERS FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND EMERGENCY FEEDING SITES. LOW-INCOME YOUTH WILL BE REACHED THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS, CHILDCARE PROVIDERS, EXTENSION 4-H, AND OTHER AGENCIES WHO SERVE YOUTH IN THE EFNEP COUNTIES.  ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: DELIVERY OF EFNEP IS ANTICIPATED TO BE IN FIFTEEN IDAHO COUNTIES; SPANNING ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE. PLACEMENT OF EFNEP IN THE SELECTED COUNTIES, ALIGNS THE PROGRAM IN THE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY IN IDAHO, THE LARGEST POPULATION BASES WITHIN THE FOUR IDAHO REGIONS, AND AREAS WITH PARTNERSHIP AND PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES. IDAHO EFNEP NETWORKS WITH A VARIETY OF PARTNERS TO DELIVER CLASSES TO ADULTS AND YOUTH USING EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA, INCLUDING GO, GLOW, GROW; CHOOSE HEALTH: FOOD, FUN, AND FITNESS; APPETITE FOR HEALTH; THE LEARNING KITCHEN YOUTH CURRICULUM; AND EFNEP FAMILIES EATING SMART, MOVING MORE.  IDAHO EFNEP HAS A ROBUST RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER WESTERN REGION 1862 INSTITUTIONS, AND IS COLLABORATING WITH THE WESTERN REGION ON A YOUTH PARTICIPATION GOAL. EFNEP PROFESSIONALS  PARTICIPATE IN REGULAR CONFERENCE CALLS, REVIEW NATIONAL CURRICULA, AND ATTEND ANNUAL CONFERENCES. CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SUPPORT EFNEP YOUTH PROGRAMMING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EFNEP IN IDAHO IS ALIGNED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EDUCATION (SNAP-ED). THIS ALIGNMENT INCLUDES PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS STANDARDIZING CURRICULA, ALIGNING TRAINING FOR STAFF AND COLLABORATING ON EVALUATION METHODS TO ALLOW ASSESSMENT OF COLLECTIVE IMPACTS OF NUTRITION EDUCATION FOR LIMITED RESOURCE AUDIENCES. LOCAL HEAD START PROGRAMS OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY AND HAVE BEEN LONG-TIME EFNEP PARTNERS. EFNEP IN IDAHO ALSO RECRUITS AND TEACHES CLIENTS AT MIGRANT HEAD START. THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO PARTNERS WITH THE STATE NUTRITION NETWORK \u2013 HEALTHY EATING ACTIVITY LIVING THROUGH WORK ON GRANTS. IDAHO EFNEP PLANS TO IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE WIC PROGRAM THROUGH ESTABLISHING LINES OF COMMUNICATION. IN ADDITION, IDAHO EFNEP PLANS TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL LIMITED INCOME HEALTH CARE OFFICES AS A RESOURCE FOR INCREASING OUR ADULT PARTICIPATION NUMBERS.  IDAHO EFNEP WILL CONTINUE TO INCORPORATE LOW, MEDIUM, AND HIGH-LEVEL TECHNOLOGY APPROACHES INTO OUR PROGRAMMING. WE WILL BE CONTINUING TO INCORPORATE LOW AND MEDIUM LEVEL TECHNOLOGY APPROACHES INTO OUR PROGRAMMING, INCLUDING: A) DEMONSTRATION OF TECHNOLOGY/SOCIAL MEDIA RESOURCES IN LESSONS B) INTEGRATING EXISTING APPS INTO LESSONS WHERE APPROPRIATE, C) SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT TO REINFORCE LEARNING CONCEPTS (FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM, BLOG), D) SOCIAL MEDIA TO REACH AND RECRUIT NEW AUDIENCES (FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM) E) ONLINE MAKE-UP LESSONS, F) VIDEO CONTENT TO REINFORCE LEARNING CONCEPTS OR SUPPORT ONLINE SUCCESS STORIES.  IDAHO EFNEP WILL COORDINATE WITH SNAP-ED TO INCORPORATE PSE CHANGES WITH DIRECT NUTRITION EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CLASSES THROUGH A SMALL SPACES GARDENING PROJECT. GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO EDUCATE SNAP-ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS ON GARDEN SEEDS BEING ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE USING SNAP DOLLARS, TEACH BASIC GARDENING TECHNIQUES FOR CONTAINER GARDENS OR SMALL SPACE GARDENS, INCREASE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION, INCREASE LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND REDUCE MENTAL STRESS.  MOVING FORWARD IN YEAR 2 OF THE PROJECT, IDAHO EFNEP WILL COLLABORATE EFFORTS WITH SNAP-ED TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND LOCATIONS IN ORDER TO PILOT ONE PARTNERING SITE. IN ORDER TO WORK WITHIN THE CURRENT COMMUNITY SITES AND CREATE SUSTAINABLE GARDENS, THIS PROJECT PROPOSES TO PROVIDE THE START-UP MATERIALS FOR GARDENING IN SMALL SPACES AND CONTAINER GARDENS. THIS TYPE OF LOW-MAINTENANCE GARDEN WILL BE IDEAL AT NUMEROUS LOCATIONS, INCLUDING LOW-INCOME HOUSING, SHELTERS, AND EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE SITES. THESE ARE ALSO LOCATIONS WHERE EFNEP ALREADY PROVIDES DIRECT NUTRITION EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMMING, THUS ADDING TO THE LAYERING OF PROGRAMMING WHICH IS NECESSARY TO PROMOTE GREATER AND SUSTAINED BEHAVIOR CHANGE. YEAR 3 WILL EXPAND TO PILOT A SITE IN EACH DISTRICT ACROSS THE STATE AND TO COLLABORATE WITH MASTER GARDENERS OR VOLUNTEERS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WHO WILL PROVIDE EDUCATION ON GARDENING TECHNIQUES AND GUIDANCE ON MAINTAINING THE GARDENS AFTER THE INITIAL START-UP YEAR.  DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES 1. IMPROVE ADULT DIET QUALITY THE AVERAGE CHANGE IN HEALTHY EATING INDEX (HEI) SCORES OF OUR ADULT PARTICIPANTS BETWEEN ENTRY AND EXIT IS BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND OUR TIER GROUP AVERAGE. OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE CHANGE IN HEI SCORE OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS. IMPROVEMENT WILL BE MEASURED USING THE WEBNEERS ADULT DIET SUMMARY DATA. CHANGE IN THE HEI SCORE WILL BE CALCULATED FROM THE ADULT DIET SUMMARY REPORT ITEM NUMBER 4. HEALTHY EATING INDEX 2015 SUMMARY (MEAN TOTAL EXIT \u2013 MEAN TOTAL ENTRY). IN YEAR 1, THE TARGET GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN HEI AND IMPLEMENT TRAINING FOR STAFF WITH A GOAL OF INCREASING CHANGE IN HEI BY 1 POINT IN EACH OF THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS. SOME SPECIFIC  STRATEGIES WE INTEND TO IMPLEMENT ARE: USE OF THE PARTICIPANT DIET SUMMARY REPORTS DURING ADULT SERIES, ENHANCED IN-PERSON TRAINING FOR NEW HIRES AND WEBINAR-BASED TRAININGS FOR ALL STAFF, INCREASED SUPERVISION RELATED TO 24-HOUR DIET RECALL ADMINISTRATION, AND A FOCUS ON PROGRAM FIDELITY RELATED TO FOOD AND NUTRITION.  2. INCREASE YOUTH MIDDLE SCHOOL REACH YOUTH PARTICIPATION BREAKDOWN IN THE WESTERN REGION IS CURRENTLY 34% (K-2), 44% (3- 5), 15% (6-8) AND 6% (9-12). BY 2024, THE WESTERN REGION WILL SHIFT THESE PERCENTAGES TOWARD THE NATIONAL YOUTH PARTICIPATION BREAKDOWN GOAL OF 20% (K-2), 30% (3-5), 30% (6-8), AND 20% (9-12). TO CONTRIBUTE TO MEETING THIS REGIONAL GOAL IDAHO WILL WORK TO INCREASE 6-8TH GRADE REACH. IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MEASURED USING DATA FROM WEBNEERS YOUTH SUMMARY. YOUTH SUMMARY REPORT 5A) GRADE DISTRIBUTION WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THIS PRIORITY. THE TARGET GOAL FOR YEARS 1 AND 2 WILL BE TO IDENTIFY AND TRAIN ON A MIDDLE-SCHOOL SPECIFIC CURRICULUM AND MAINTAIN PERCENT OF YOUTH PARTICIPANTS GRADES 6-8. IN YEARS 3-5, THE TARGET GOAL WILL BE TO INCREASE 6-8TH GRADE PARTICIPATION ABOVE BASELINE BY 1% PER YEAR.  3. INCREASE ADULT GRADUATION RATE IDAHO'S ADULT GRADUATION RATE HAS BEEN DECREASING OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS (65% IN 2017, 63% IN 2018, AND 57% IN 2019). THE 2019 GRADUATION RATE IS BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND THE WESTERN REGION RATE. INCREASE IN ADULT GRADUATION RATE WILL BE DETERMINED BY CHANGE IN WEBNEERS ADULT SUMMARY DATA. ADULT SUMMARY REPORT ITEM NUMBER 10. STATUS OF PARTICIPANTS (PERCENT COMPLETED PROGRAM) WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THIS PRIORITY. TO FACILITATE AN INCREASE IN ADULT GRADUATION RATES, IDAHO WILL IMPLEMENT MEDIUM AND HIGH-LEVEL TECHNOLOGY APPROACHES IN THE FORM OF ONLINE MAKE- UP LESSONS AND BLENDED LESSONS AS OUTLINED IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA OUTREACH PLAN APPROVED IN FY2020 AND UPDATED IN FY2021. AS NOTED IN THE UPDATED TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA OUTREACH PLAN, THE STANDARD 6-LESSON SERIES WILL BE EXTENDED TO 9 SESSIONS, INCREASING CONTACT WITH PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS ADDING AN ADDITIONAL LESSON TO THE SERIES. A SECOND SERIES OF 6 LESSONS WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE AND INSTRUCTORS ENCOURAGED TO OFFER THIS EXTENDED SERIES AS PARTNERSHIPS ALLOW. TARGET GOALS WILL BE TO MAINTAIN ADULT GRADUATION RATES IN YEARS 1 AND 2 AS INSTRUCTORS ARE TRAINING ON THE ONLINE LESSONS AND GRADUALLY IMPLEMENTING AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY INDIVIDUAL SUPERVISORS. IN YEARS 3-5, THE TARGET GOAL WILL BE TO INCREASE ADULT GRADUATION RATES BY 1% PER YEAR.  4. IMPROVE YOUTH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IDAHO EFNEP HAS REPORTED CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN YOUTH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR CHANGE OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS (31% IN 2016, 34% IN 2017, 39% IN 2018, AND 49% IN 2019). HOWEVER, IN FY2019 THE PERCENT OF YOUTH REPORTING POSITIVE CHANGES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN IDAHO WAS STILL BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE (57%) AND THE WESTERN REGION AVERAGE (59%). IDAHO'S 5-YEAR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE INCREASING THE % OF YOUTH WHO REPORT POSITIVE CHANGES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOLLOWING AN EFNEP CLASS SERIES. IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MEASURED USING DATA FROM WEBNEERS YOUTH QUESTIONNAIRE SUMMARY REPORT ITEM NUMBER 5. (SUMMARY OF IMPROVEMENT FOR ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH) WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE THE PERCENT OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH OF ALL AGES WHO REPORT AN IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTICES OR GAIN KNOWLEDGE. STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE THIS METRIC INCLUDE IN-PERSON AND WEB-BASED INSTRUCTOR TRAINING AND REVIEW OF LESSONS TEACHING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTICES AS WELL AS A REVIEW OF THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS TAUGHT AND IDENTIFICATION OF MOST WELL RECEIVED ACTIVITIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL ACTIVITIES. THE TARGET 5-YEAR GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH OR CHILDREN REPORTING IMPROVED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTICES OR KNOWLEDGE GAIN BY2% PER YEAR FROM BASELINE IN ORDER TO ALIGN WITH THE WESTERN REGION METRIC BY YEAR 5.  5. IMPROVE ADULT PARTICIPANTS' FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IMPROVING ADULT FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WAS A PROGRAM PRIORITY FOR IDAHO\u2019S  LAST 5-YEAR PLAN. WE HAVE REPORTED INCONSISTENT CHANGE IN FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS. IN FY19, THE PERCENT OF ADULT PARTICIPANTS REPORTING IMPROVED FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOLLOWING EFNEP PROGRAMMING IN IDAHO WAS THE LOWEST IT HAS BEEN IN THE LAST 5 YEARS AND WAS BELOW THAT REPORTED NATIONALLY AND IN THE WESTERN REGION. WHILE THE CHANGE IS STILL MEANINGFUL, (5-YEAR AVERAGE OF 71%), THERE IS CLEAR ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. THIS PROGRAM PRIORITY WILL BE ASSESSED USING THE EFNEP ADULT QUESTIONNAIRE ADMINISTERED BEFORE AND AFTER A SERIES OF CLASSES. THE PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS SHOWING IMPROVEMENT IN ONE OR MORE OF THE FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES QUESTIONS WILL BE IDENTIFIED FROM THE ADULT QUESTIONNAIRE SUMMARY REPORT IN WEBNEERS, ITEM NUMBER 1.5 SUMMARY OF THE NUMBER OF PRACTICES IMPROVED WITHIN CLUSTERS OF QUESTIONS: FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE PERCENT CHANGE BY 3% PER YEAR TO REACH A TARGET OF 79% (JUST UNDER THE FY19 NATIONAL AND WESTERN REGION AVERAGE). STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL INCLUDE ONGOING INSTRUCTOR TRAINING AT THE STATE AND DISTRICT LEVEL AND ADDING A GROCERY STORE TOUR (OR VIDEO) TO OUR CORE SERIES. SEVERAL OF THE CORE SERIES OF CLASSES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN THE FAMILIES EATING SMART AND MOVING MORE CURRICULUM, WHICH IS USED FOR OUR ADULT DIRECT EDUCATION CLASSES, FOCUS ON FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. WE WILL ALSO EXTEND OUR CONTACT TIME WITH PARTICIPANTS BY ADMINISTERING ENTRY/EXIT PAPERWORK, PRE/POST SURVEY, AND 24-HOUR RECALL SEPARATE FROM ANY OF THE EATING SMART AND MOVING MORE (ESMM) LESSONS. THE IDEA BEING THAT PARTICIPANTS WILL NOT BE RUSHED (THE NEW EFNEP ADULT QUESTIONNAIRE IS A BIT LONGER THAN PREVIOUS QUESTIONNAIRES). IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE TIME AFTER THE LAST ESMM LESSON TO APPLY THE LESSON CONCEPTS BEFORE COMPLETING THE POST-SURVEY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "ID", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "a9915c54-971b-ccc0-bc11-1f5b9bfdcd66-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23EFNEPXXXG064_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 155356417, "Award ID": "NI23EFNEPXXXG063", "Award Amount": 137510.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-22", "CFDA Number": "10.514", "Description": "EFNEP PROGRAM DESCRIPTION  CHRONIC DISEASE AND FOOD INSECURITY DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT LOW INCOME AND MINORITY AMERICAN POPULATIONS.

EFNEP HELPS LOW-INCOME FAMILIES AND CHILDREN GAIN THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NEEDED TO CHANGE CURRENT ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS WHEN IT COMES TO CHOOSING NUTRITIOUS FOODS AND IMPROVING THEIR HEALTH.  DATA ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH AND POVERTY INDICATE THE NEED FOR NUTRITION EDUCATION.

EAT SMART MOVE MORE NC REPORTS 68% OF ADULTS AND 31% OF YOUTH (10-17) ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. FURTHERMORE, TWO KEY BEHAVIORS, VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE ALARMINGLY POOR IN OUR CHILDREN. 41% OF YOUTH CONSUME VEGETABLES LESS THAN ONE TIME PER DAYAND 78% DO NOT MEET THE RECOMMENDED 60 MINUTES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PER DAY.  FAMILIES AND CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY SUFFER FROM HIGHER RATES OF OBESITY AND POOR NUTRITION LEADING TO OTHER HEALTH CONCERNS. RESEARCH SUGGESTS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN POVERTY, FOOD INSECURITY, AND OBESITY AND A CORRELATION BETWEEN OBESITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE.  NOT ONLY DO THE STATISTICS DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR NUTRITION EDUCATION, BUT 9 LISTENING SESSIONS HELD BY EFNEP ACROSS THE STATE IN 2019 ALSO INDICATE THE VALUE AND INTEREST IN NUTRITION EDUCATION OF STAKEHOLDERS. THESE LISTENING SESSIONS RESULTED IN THREE RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) PARTNER WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS; 2) PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES TO CHANGE THE NUTRITION ENVIRONMENT: AND 3) GROW AND EXPAND THE PROGRAM SO THAT HEALTHY EATING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BECOME THE NORM FOR CHILDREN IN NC.

AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES: AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY  UTAH HAS OVER 18,000 FARMS AND RANCHES SPANNING 11 MILLION ACRES, WHICH GENERATE MORE THAN $21 BILLION IN TOTAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT). WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT UTAH BECOMES MORE URBANIZED EACH YEAR, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO PLAY A VITAL PART IN OUR STATE. AS THE POPULATION OF UTAH AND THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO GROW, FOOD PRODUCTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY (USU) EXTENSION HAS LED THE WAY FOR 105 YEARS IN PROVIDING NON-BIASED, RESEARCH-BASED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PRODUCERS AND THE UTAH AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. USU EXTENSION HAS NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FACULTY WITH EXPERTISE IN ALL AREAS OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION AND SCIENCE.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES  THE WESTERN U.S. CONTAINS STATES WITH VAST TRACTS OF PUBLIC LAND SURROUNDING SMALLER AREAS THAT ARE PRIVATELY OWNED, MOSTLY ADJACENT TO WATER. THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASE OF ANY ECONOMY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMIC AND AESTHETIC ENVIRONMENTS FOR THATAREA. CHANGES IN THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASE BRING VARIATION IN THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE. CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING NATURAL RESOURCE CHARACTERISTICS ARE FOUND IN SOILS, WATER, RANGE, FOREST, ANIMALS, AND AIR RESOURCES. THE PROPER AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS A PRIMARY CONCERN, PARTICULARLY FOR ENVIRONMENTS AS VARIED AND UNIQUE AS IN THE WEST.  THIS CRITICAL ISSUE INVOLVES IMPROVING DECISION-MAKING RELATIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IN AN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND BIOLOGICAL SENSE. USU EXTENSION ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES THROUGH THE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM. THE GOAL OF THIS EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE NON-FORMAL EDUCATION TO RESIDENTS, STAKEHOLDERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE, FACILITATE, AND STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP  AND SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE USE IN UTAH. THIS PROJECT PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON FOREST MANAGEMENT, WATER CONSERVATION, AND STEWARDSHIP OF PUBLICLANDS. THE PROJECT TARGETS ADULTS AND YOUTH, AND THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO (A) EQUIP RESIDENTS WITH THE COMPETENCY TO EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE IN NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION, AND (B) FACILITATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS TO STRENGTHEN NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND ENABLE SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE.  FACULTY INVOLVED IN THE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING WATER MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES, AND TOURISM.

MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, DEMONSTRATIONS, CONFERENCES, AND FIELD VISITS ON TOPICS RELATED TO WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY, CLIMATE SCIENCE, BIOMASS, PERMACULTURE, OUTDOOR RECREATION, AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION.FOOD SAFETY  WITH A LARGE VARIETY OF FOOD PRODUCTS MOVING THROUGH COMPLEX DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, FOOD SAFETY IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR PRODUCERS, PR OCESSORS, DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, AND THE FINAL CONSUMER. FOODBORNE ILLNESS IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH, CLAIMING THE LIVES OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS; THE ELDERLY, YOUNG, PREGNANT WOMEN, PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRED IMMUNE FUNCTION, AND THE CHRONICALLY ILL. IMPROPER FOOD HANDLING AND PREPARATION OF FOOD IN FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE HOME CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD-BORNE ILLNESSES. THE PUBLIC FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION AIMS TO PROVIDE RELEVANT RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATION TO UTAH RESIDENTS ON BEST PRACTICES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FOOD CONTAMINATION AND FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. THE MAJOR FOCUS AREAS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE FOOD PRESERVATION TECHNIQUES AND HOUSEHOLD FOOD STORAGE.  THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE PUBLIC FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION PROGRAM ARE TO (A) REDUCE THE OCCURRENCES OF FOODBORNE ILLNESSES IN UTAH THROUGH RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATION ON FOOD SAFETY PRACTICES IN HOUSEHOLDS, AND (B) TO REDUCE FOOD CONTAMINATION IN THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN BY PROVIDING RELEVANT EDUCATION ON BEST PRACTICES TO PROCESSORS AND PRODUCERS. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN FOOD SAFETY INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, CONSULTATIONS, AND (VIRTUAL AND FACE-TO- FACE) DEMONSTRATIONS TARGETED AT RESIDENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES ON FOOD PRESERVATION, CANNING, PRESSURE TESTING, FOOD PRODUCT TESTING, AND FOODBORNE ILLNESSES.  NUTRITION AND HEALTH  THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE NUTRITION INFORMATION AND EDUCATION TO THE PUBLIC TO ENABLE CONSUMERS TO MAKE WISE DIETARY CHOICES. AS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIET, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, AND DISEASE PREVENTION BECOME CLEARER, THE PROMOTION OF HEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS AND LIFESTYLES FOR BOTH YOUTH AND ADULTS HAS RECEIVED INCREASED ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. WITH HIGH LEVELS OF OBESITY, CHRONIC DISEASE, AND POOR DIETARY HABITS, THERE IS A NEED FOR NON-FORMAL NUTRITION EDUCATION THAT ADDRESSES INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY HEALTH AND WELLNESS. THE PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION SEEKS TO DECREASE THE INCIDENCES OF CHRONIC DISEASES AND OTHER NUTRITION-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES AMONG RESIDENTS THROUGH NON-FORMAL NUTRITION EDUCATION.  THE PRIORITIES FOR THIS PROGRAM ARE TO EXPAND NUTRITIONAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, AND TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETARY HABITS. THEREFORE, THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE THE PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM ARE TO (A) EMPOWER RESIDENTS TO MAKE HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES AND IMPROVE THEIR NUTRITIONAL INTAKE, AND (B) REDUCE THE ECONOMIC COST OF CHRONIC DISEASES IN UTAH THROUGH ONGOING NUTRITION EDUCATION TO YOUTH AND ADULTS.  FACULTY INVOLVED IN PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING N UTRITION, OBESITY, CHRONIC DISEASES, AND FOOD SCIENCE. RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN NUTRITION AND HEALTH INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND CONSULTATIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO CHRONIC DISEASES, NUTRITION EDUCATION, HEALTHY AND AFFORDABLE RECIPES, DIET BEHAVIOR CHANGES, AND YOUTH NUTRITION.  COMMUNITY RESILIENCE  UTAH CONSISTS OF MANY RURAL COUNTIES SPREAD OUT OVER VAST AREAS OF LAND, AND ONLY A FEW URBAN COUNTIES IN CENTRALIZED LOCATIONS. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN INCREASING DISPARITY IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS IN RURAL COUNTIES. THE MAJORITY OF CURRENT AND NEW JOBS ARE LOCATED ALONG THE URBAN COUNTIES IN THE WASATCH FRONT, INCLUDING JOBS IN THE GROWING TECHNOLOGY SECTOR IN UTAH'S \"SILICON SLOPES.\" IN CONTRAST, RURAL RESIDENTS STRUGGLE TO FIND WELL-PAYING AND STABLE WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ARE OFTEN FACED WITH THE DECISION TO RELOCATE TO URBAN CENTERS. THIS EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC DEPRESSION IN RURAL COUNTIES SINCE RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION LEADS TO LOW PRODUCTIVITY IN THESE COUNTIES. THERE IS A NEED TO SUPPORT RURAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH COMMUNITY AND CAPACITY-BUILDING INITIATIVES.  IN ADDITION TO ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS, INDIVIDUALS IN RURAL COUNTIES SUFFER FROM RELATIVELY HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. THE RATES OF OPIOID OVERDOSES IN RURAL UTAH HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. UTAH HAD EIGHT (8) OUT OF 10 ADULT OVERDOSE DEATHS EACH WEEK DUE TO OPIOIDS IN 2019, AND HALF OF THOSE WERE SPECIFICALLY DUE TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS (UTAH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH [UDOH] INDICATOR-BASED SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH [IBIS], 2021). IN 2020, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CREATED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING INCREASES IN OPIOID-RELATED DEATHS DUE TO FENTANYL.  THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION IS TO STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES ACROSS UTAH THROUGH FACILITATED COMMUNITY-FOCUSED COALITIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS, ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION, AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES PROGRAM ARE TO (A) CONNECT RURAL COMMUNITIES TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN URBAN CENTERS THROUGH INNOVATIVE WORKPLACE PRACTICES (E.G., REMOTE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS), AND (B) FACILITATE EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS, AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COALITIONS TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS IN RURAL COUNTIES. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN COMMUNITY RESILIENCE INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND INTERVENTIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, RURAL EMPLOYMENT, REMOTE WORKING, BUILDING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COALITIONS, AND TRIBAL INITIATIVES.  INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  UTAH IS IN THE TOP 5 U.S. STATES WITH BANKRUPTCY, AND THERE IS A NEED FOR OUTREACH EDUCATION TO FACILITATE IMPROVED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. BECAUSE OF UTAH'S TYPICALLY LARGER FAMILY SIZE, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME AVAILABLE FOR BASIC FAMILY NEEDS SLIPS BELOW THE MEAN FOR THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. UTAH FAMILIES ALREADY FACE HIGH DEBT LOADS LEADING TO BANKRUPTCY, LOW SAVINGS, AND A LACK OF LIQUID ASSETS. HENCE, THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PLANNED EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO ENHANCE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (FRM).  FRM, WHICH RELATES TO FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, ALSO TIES TO OTHER ASPECTS OF FAMILY HEALTH, SUCH AS HEALTHY MARITAL AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. AS A BROAD PROGRAM AREA, THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES YOUTH, ADULTS, AND FAMILIES IN UTAH. DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO; (A) STRENGTHEN FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND (B) IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES.  FACULTY INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCT RESEARCH IN FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING, RELATIONSHIPS, AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THE RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE- BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT.

EFNEP IS ALIGNED WITH ONE SPECIFIC STRATEGIC GOAL FROM THE USDA STRATEGIC PLAN FOR FY 2022- 2026. STRATEGIC GOAL 4: MAKE SAFE, NUTRI TIOUS FOOD AVAILABLE TO ALL AMERICANS; OBJECTIVE 4.1: INCREASE FOOD SECURITY THROUGH ASSISTANCE AND ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS AND AFFORDABLE FOOD.  ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: IN THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA-LINCOLN (UNL) INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES (IANR), WE ARE ALL ABOUT PEOPLE AND THE FOOD, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAT SUSTAIN THEM. IANR INNOVATION IN RESEARCH, TEACHING, AND EXTENSION EDUCATION  PLACES NEBRASKA ON THE LEADING EDGE OF FOOD PRODUCTION, ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, HUMAN NUTRITION, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT. COMPOSED OF THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES AND NATURAL RESOURCES (CASNR), THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH DIVISION (ARD), NEBRASKA EXTENSION, AND THE ARD AND EXTENSION COMPONENTS OF THREE DEPARTMENTS IN THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND HUMAN SCIENCES; IANR IS COMMITTED TO GROWING THE FUTURE OF NEBRASKA'S PEOPLE, BUSINESSES, AND COMMUNITIES. STRATEGIC PLANNING IS INTEGRAL TO IANR'S FUNCTION AS A LAND-GRANT INSTITUTION, AND IT PRIDES ITSELF ON WORKING AS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT ACROSS THE THREE MISSION AREAS. IANR STRIVES TO COMBINE RESEARCH, TEACHING AND EXTENSION IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY, COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT ENCOURAGES THE BEST THINKING AND EXPERTISE FROM ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TO ENSURE NEBRASKA\u2019S COMPETITIVENESS IN A WORLD OF CHANGE AND CHALLENGE. SPECIFIC TO EFNEP, NEBRASKA MAIN PRIORITIES FALL IN ALIGNMENT WITH: 1. IMPROVING FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FOR ADULTS - EFNEP NEBRASKA WILL INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF ADULT PARTICIPANTS THAT IMPROVE IN ONE OR MORE FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (I.E., COOK DINNER AT HOME, COMPARE FOOD PRICES, PLAN MEALS BEFORE SHOPPING, LOOK IN REFRIGERATOR OR CUPBOARD BEFORE SHOPPING, OR MAKE A LIST BEFORE SHOPPING) FROM 75% TO 80% BY 2025. 2. IMPROVING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR ADULTS - NEBRASKA EFNEP WILL INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF ADULT PARTICIPANTS WHO IMPROVE IN ONE OR MORE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS (I.E., EXERCISING FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES, DOING WORKOUTS TO BUILD AND STRENGTHEN MUSCLES, OR MAKING SMALL CHANGES TO BE MORE ACTIVE) FROM 73% TO 78% BY 2025. 3. IMPROVING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR YOUTH - NEBRASKA EFNEP WILL INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH PARTICIPANTS WHO IMPROVE IN ONE OR MORE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS FROM 45% TO 53% BY 2025. 4. INCREASE OLDER YOUTH REACH - NEBRASKA EFNEP WILL UTILIZE NEW 6-12TH GRADE-FOCUSED CURRICULA: TEEN CUISINE AND HUSKER PERFORMANCE. 5. TECHNOLOGY - BY 2025 NEBRASKA EFNEP WILL BE USING THE WEB-BASED MEDIA PLATFORM TO TEACH 60 ONLINE LESSONS AND MAKE-UP LESSONS YEARLY TO ADULT EFNEP PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS REINFORCE LESSON CONCEPTS BETWEEN CLASSES AND FOR POST-GRADUATES.  DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES: THE CAPACITY FUNDING IANR RECEIVES IS ALLOCATED WITHIN TWO KEY, CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS THE ABOVE FOCUS AREAS. EFNEP FALLS UNDER THE FOSTERING HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE FOCUS AREA.  FOSTERING HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON USING BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH IN THE LIFE/AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES TO GENERATE KNOWLEDGE CRITICAL TO MAXIMIZING PRODUCTIVITY IN FOOD SCIENCES; BUSINESS/COMMUNITY VITALITY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; HEALTHY LIVING; AND DEVELOPMENT AND SUCCESS OF YOUNG CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES. RESEARCH EFFORTS SPAN THE BASIC/FUNDAMENTAL TO THE APPLIED/TRANSLATIONAL, RELATING TO NUTRITION/HE ALTH, FOOD SAFETY, EARLYCHILDHOOD, YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, FAMILY STRENGTHENING, AND COMMUNITY CAPACITY  BUILDING. EXTENSION PROGRAMS WILL ENGAGE CLIENTELE BY TRANSLATING EXISTING AND NEW RESEARCH TO NEBRASKANS THAT OPTIMIZE PRODUCTIVITY AND LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS. THESE EFFORTS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY UNDERGRADUATE/GRADUATE EDUCATION DESIGNED TO CONTRIBUTE THE STATE\u2019S LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH.  SCIENCE EMPHASIS AREAS: EDUCATION AND MULTICULTURAL ALLIANCES FAMILY <(>&<)> CONSUMER SCIENCES FOOD SAFETY HUMAN NUTRITION YOUTH DEVELOPMENT  EFNEP CLASSES PROVIDE HANDS-ON LEARNING SO ADULT AND YOUTH PARTICIPANTS CAN GAIN SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE IN PLANNING FOR, PURCHASING, PREPARING, AN EATING HEALTHY MEALS AND SNACKS. PARTICIPANTS ENJOY FAMILY-BASED CLASSES SO FAMILIES CAN LEARN, ADAPT AND CHANGE HEALTH BEHAVIORS TOGETHER - A PRACTICE BACKED BY RESEARCH TO MAKE BEHAVIOR CHANGE LONG-LASTING. PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR FOOD RESOURCES AND PROVIDE HEALTHY MEALS FOR THEIR FAMILIES AS A RESULT OF ATTENDING EFNEP CLASSES. ADULT PARTICIPANTS WILL ALSO IMPROVE FOOD SAFETY PRACTICES, INCLUDING HANDWASHING.  FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL OUTCOMES, WE WELCOME THE REVIEW OF IANR\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RESULTS.  INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: AS NEBRASKA\u2019S RESIDENTS ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES AND STAKEHOLDERS, THERE IS AN ONGOING, TWO-WAY DIALOGUE TO ENSURE THAT IANR\u2019S PRIORITIES REFLECT THE NEEDS OF THE STATE.

PRACTICING ALL OF THESE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF WELL-BEING CONTRIBUTES SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE BURDEN OF PREVENTABLE ILLNESS AND PREMATURE DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES AND TO THE NATION'S ECONOMIC BURDEN. HOWEVER, MOST ADULTS AND YOUTH DO NOT PRACTICE HEALTHY EATING HABITS OR GET ENOUGH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN THEIR DAILY LIVES, LEADING TO A DRASTIC INCREASE IN OBESITY. ACCORDING TO THE CDC BETWEEN 2001 AND 2010, CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS DECREASED, BUT STILL ACCOUNTS FOR 10% OF TOTAL CALORIC INTAKE. BETWEEN 2003 AND 2010, TOTAL FRUIT INTAKE AND WHOLE FRUIT INTAKE AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS INCREASED. HOWEVER, MOST YOUTH STILL DO NOT MEET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE RECOMMENDATIONS.

APPROXIMATELY H ALF OF THESE EMPTY CALORIES COME FROM SIX SOURCES: SODA, FRUIT DRINKS, DAIRY DESSERTS, GRAIN DESSERTS, PIZZA, AND WHOLE MILK. MOST YOUTH DO NOT CONSUME THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF TOTAL WATER. ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC), DIETARY FACTORS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH 4 OF THE 10 LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH: CORONARY HEART DISEASE, SOME TYPES OF CANCER, STROKE, AND TYPE 2 DIABETES. CHILDHOOD OBESITY IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES PUTTING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AT RISK FOR POOR HEALTH. OBESITY PREVALENCE AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IS STILL TOO HIGH. FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AGED 2-19 YEARS: THE PREVALENCE OF OBESITY WAS 18.5% AND AFFECTED ABOUT 13.7 MILLION CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. OBESITY PREVALENCE WAS 13.9% AMONG 2- TO 5-YEAR-OLD, 18.4% AMONG 6- TO 11-YEAR-OLD, AND 20.6% AMONG 12- TO 19-YEAR-OLD. CHILDHOOD OBESITY IS ALSO MORE COMMON AMONG CERTAIN POPULATIONS. IN WEST VIRGINIA 16.4 PERCENT OF THE 9TH GRADE STUDENTS ARE OBESE AND 22.3 PERCENT OF 12 GRADE. EACH GRADE YEAR GETS PROGRESSIVELY WORSE WITH A DECLINE TO 16.7 PERCENT GRADE 11 AND THEM SHOOTS BACK UP IN 12 GRADE. THE RAPID SPREAD DURING THE 1990'S OCCURRED ACROSS ALL STATES, REGIONS, AND DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. HIGHEST RATES OF OBESITY FOR 10- TO 17-YEAR-OLD, WEST VIRGINIA (20.3%), WAS RANKED SECOND HIGHEST WITH MISSISSIPPI (26.1%), BEING 1ST. WERE AND KENTUCKY (19.3%). ACCORDING TO THE 2019 KIDS COUNT, 26 PERCENT OF WEST VIRGINIA CHILDREN (94,000) UNDER THE AGE OF 18 LIVED IN POVERTY COMPARED WITH 18 PERCENT OF U.S. CHILDREN. CHILDREN FARE WORSE THAN ADULTS ON POVERTY MEASURES, AND CHILDREN UNDER AGE SIX SUFFER THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES OF ALL.

THIS 9 TO 12-LESSON CURRICULUM, BASED ON SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY, IS RESEARCH-BASED AND FOCUSES ON THE FOUR CORE AREAS INCLUDING FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, FOOD SAFETY, DIET QUALITY/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND FOOD SECURITY. THE THREE SUPPLEMENTAL LESSONS ALLOW FOR MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE RELEVANT TO PREGNANCY AND FEEDING INFANTS AND TODDLERS. COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A REMOTE DELIVERY STRATEGY FOR THE 9 CORE LESSONS OF ESBA THAT WE WILL UTILIZE TO EXPAND OUR REACH WHILE FACE-TO-FACE PROGRAMMING IS SUSPENDED OR LESSENED DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING. EACH LESSON HAS A PRE-RECORDED VIDEO WITH CLOSED CAPTIONING INENGLISH AND SPANISH AS WELL AS A SCRIPTED LIVE DISCUSSION TEMPLATE THAT CAN BE FACILITATED VIA THE PHONE OR WEBINAR. FURTHER USE OF REMOTE LESSONS AS SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES DECREASE IS DISCUSSED IN THE TECHNOLOGY PLAN.

CURRENT RESEARCH REPORTS SHOW THE NEED FOR EFNEP IS GREATER THAN EVER IN THIS STATE. SINCE MID-MARCH OF 2020 THERE HAS BEEN A 60% SPIKE IN DEMAND FOR HUNGER RELIEF SERVICES. OVER 13.2% OF THE POPULATION LIVES BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL AND 18.9% OF CHILDREN ARE FOOD INSECURE. OREGON EFNEP WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET LOW-INCOME FAMILIES AND YOUTH MOST AT RISK WITH INFORMATION ON HEALTHY EATING, BUDGETING, SHOPPING, MEAL PLANNING, AND ACCESSING FOOD RESOURCES. PARAPROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS TEACH CLASSES IN COMMUNITIES WHERE FAMILIES LIVE. HANDS-ON FOOD PREPARATION HELPS FAMILIES GAIN NEW COOKING SKILLS SO THAT LOW-COST, NUTRITIOUS MEALS ARE COOKED AND EATEN AT HOME.

PRIORITIES #1: IMPROVING FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SKILLS IN ADULTS WHILE PARTICIPATING IN OREGON EFNEP CLASSES, ADULTS LEARN NEW SKILLS IN FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, INCLUDING PURCHASING, SELECTING, OR OTHERWISE OBTAINING, PREPARING, AND STORING HEALTHY FOODS. IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS, WE WILL EMPHASIZE INTRODUCING PARTICIPANTS TO NEW LOW-COST, HEALTHY FOODS, PLANNING MEALS IN ADVANCE, PREPARING FOODS AT HOME, STRETCHING FOOD RESOURCES, AND REDUCING FOOD WASTE. OREGON\u2019S EFNEP GOAL IS TO INCREASE BY 1% PER YEAR (FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS) THE PERCENTAGE OF PARTICIPANTS WHO IMPROVE ON ONE OR MORE FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. BASED ON THE FFY2021 FOOD AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE, OUR BASELINE FIGURE IS 83%.  #2: IMPROVING ADULT PARTICIPANT HANDWASHING SKILLS REGULAR HANDWASHING IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO REMOVE GERMS, AVOID GETTING SICK AND PREVENT THE SPREAD OF GERMS TO OTHERS. IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO TO PREVENT FOOD POISONING WHEN PREPARING FOOD. IN 2020, THE CDC LAUNCHED LIFE IS BETTER WITH CLEAN HANDS, A NEW NATIONAL CAMPAIGN DESIGNED TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HANDWASHING AT KEY TIMES IN BOTH HOMES AND PUBLIC SETTINGS, SUCH AS BEFORE COOKING OR AFTER USING THE BATHROOM. BASED ON PARTICIPANT DATA FROM FFY 2018 AND 2019, WE DISCOVERED THAT HAND WASHING IS ONE OF THE SKILLS WITH THE SMALLEST PROGRESS ACROSS EFNEP\u2019S CORE AREAS, WITH ONLY 19% OF ADULTS WASHING THEIR HANDS MORE OFTEN BEFORE PREPARING FOOD. FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS, IMPROVING ADULT PARTICIPANT HAND WASHING SKILLS BY 1% EACH YEAR WILL BE A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR EFNEP.  #3: IMPROVING ADULT PARTICIPANT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IMPROVES STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, HELPS TO CONTROL WEIGHT, AND IMPROVES BLOOD PRESSURE AND CHOLESTEROL LEVELS. OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE PERCENT OF ADULTS WHO INDICATE A POSITIVE CHANGE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BY 1% FOR EACH OF THE NEXT 5 YEARS. BASED ON THE NEW FOOD AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE, OUR BASELINE TARGET IS 84%.  #4: INCREASE REACH OF YOUTH IN 6-8TH GRADES A PROGRAM PRIORITY OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FOR WESTERN REGION EFNEP PROGRAMS, AND THUS OREGON EFNEP, ISTO SHIFT OUR YOUTH REACH TO FOCUS ON OLDER GRADES. TO CONTRIBUTE TO MEETING THIS GOAL, OREGON WILL INCREASE BY 1% EACH YEAR THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH REACHED IN 6-8TH GRADES. ACCORDING TO THE 2019 TIER DATA, OUR BASELINE FROM FFY2019 IS 55%.  OREGON EFNEP FOCUSES ON LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON PARENTS AND OTHER ADULT CAREGIVERS (I.E., GRANDPARENTS) WHO HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FEEDING YOUNG CHILDREN, PREGNANT TEENS, YOUTH AND SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN. EMANCIPATED TEEN PARENTS ARE ANOTHER FOCUS AREA. EFNEP DOES NOT TARGET PRESCHOOL CHILDREN OR ELDERLY ADULTS.

OUT OF NJ\u2019S 21 COUNTIES, NJ\u2019S EXPANDED FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM (EFNEP) SERVES THE 5 OF GREATEST NEED, I.E., CAMDEN, ESSEX, HUDSON, MIDDLESEX, AND PASSAIC COUNTIES, WHICH SERVE AS HOME TO 64.1% OF THE STATE\u2019S IMPOVERISHED POPULATION. THE COUNTIES IN WHICH NJ EFNEP IS LOCATED HAS BEEN CHOSEN BASED ON THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS ENROLLED IN SNAP. DATA FROM MARCH 2020, RELEASED BY THE NJ DIVISION OF FAMILY DEVELOPMENT, SHOWED THEIR HOUSEHOLD SNAP ENROLLMENTS TO BE: 70,364, 59,142, 41,552, 39,218, AND 29,759 IN ESSEX, HUDSON, PASSAIC, CAMDEN AND MIDDLESEX COUNTIES, RESPECTIVELY. THE PASSAIC COUNTY OFFICE IN PATERSON CITY CLOSED IN MAY 2020, DUE TO THE LOSS OF THE PATERSON OFFICE. HOWEVER, IT IS IN THE PROGRAM\u2019S BEST INTEREST TO CONTINUE TO SERVE PASSAIC COUNTY WITH PARAPROFESSIONALS FROM THE ESSEX COUNTY OFFICE LOCATION. GIVEN THESE RATES OF POVERTY, NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM THE NJ HEALTH ASSESSMENT THERE ARE 865,900 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 260,340 CHILDREN, WHO WERE FOOD INSECURE. FURTHER, NJ\u2019S UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS EXPERIENCED HUNGER AT TWO TO THREE TIMES THE RATE OF WHITE HOUSEHOLDS. NJ EFNEP OFFER NUTRITION EDUCATION CLASS SERIES\u2019 TO HELP PEOPLE EAT BETTER AND GET MORE ACTIVE ON A BUDGET. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH CLASS SERIES\u2019 OFFERED IN THE AFOREMENTIONED COMMUNITIES AT LOCATIONS, LIKE CHURCHES, JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS AND SCHOOLS, WHERE LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS CONGREGATE. AS OF JULY 2020, THE LARGEST RACE/ETHNICITIES SERVED WERE HISPANIC (58%) AND NON- HISPANIC BLACK (21%) AND 61% WERE WOMEN AND 39% WERE MEN. GIVEN NEW DATA THAT SUGGESTS UNDER-SERVED MINORITIES HAVE SUFFERED FROM COVID-19 MORE THAN OTHER POPULATIONS, NJ EFNEP WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE HISPANIC AND NON-HISPANIC BLACK COMMUNITIES. SINCE MORE THAN 50% OF THE AUDIENCE REACHED THROUGH NJ EFNEP IS HISPANIC, CLASSES ARE TAUGHT IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. PARTICIPANTS ARE TARGETED THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT OFFER PROGRAMMING TO LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS, IN WHICH SMALL GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS CAN BE REACHED REPEATEDLY FOR A MINIMUM OF EIGHT TIMES, OVER A MINIMUM OF SIX WEEKS, FOR A MINIMUM OF 45 MINUTES. DUE TO OUR ABILITY TO REACH ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANTS USING TECHNOLOGICAL APPROACHES, NJ EFNEP WILL OFFER VIRTUAL PROGRAMMING OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTIES NJ EFNEP SERVES. ADULT GROUPS SERVED BY NJ EFNEP ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THOSE IN WHICH A MINIMUM OF 80% OF THE INDIVIDUALS ATTENDING ARE SELF-IDENTIFIED AS EITHER LOW-INCOME PARENTS/CAREGIVERS, PREGNANT WOMEN, OR YOUTH. HOWEVER, DURING THE 2015-2019 FEDERAL FISCAL YEARS (FFYS), NJ EFNEP REACHED AN EXCESSIVE PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS WHO EITHER DID NOT HAVE CHILDREN OR WHO WERE NOT PREGNANT. TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE WORK UNIT SUPERVISORS HAVE RE-EXAMINED THE SITES WITH WHICH THEY CURRENTLY PARTNER AND THEY HAVE REMOVED OR RENEGOTIATED WITH SITES THAT CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO DELIVER THE APPROPRIATE ADULT TARGET AUDIENCE. THEY HAVE PUT EXTENSIVE EFFORT INTO IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL ADULT SITES THAT MORE EXCLUSIVELY SERVE THE NJ EFNEP TARGET AUDIENCE. IN THE PAST 3 YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED THE PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS WITH CHILDREN OR WHO ARE PREGNANT FROM 67% TO EXCEED THE REQUIRED 80%, (I.E., TO 85%). THIS YEAR WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF THESE ADULTS REACHED TO 86% OF OUR TOTAL ADULT POPULATION. PROGRESS WILL BE MEASURED THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF THE DATA REGARDING THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS WITH CHILDREN OR WHO ARE  PREGNANT, WHICH IS FOUND IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLD CHILDREN SECTION OF THE ADULT SUMMARY REPORT IN WEBNEERS (THE EFNEP REPORTING SYSTEM). ONE OF THE LARGEST NUTRITION ISSUES AMONG OUR AUDIENCE IS LOW VEGETABLE INTAKE. THE CDC HAS STATED THAT ONLY 8.3% OF ADULTS IN NJ MEET THEIR DAILY VEGETABLE INTAKE RECOMMENDATION. THUS, THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES NJ EFNEP IS INTENT ON ADDRESSING. MANY OF OUR PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE VEGETABLES FROM FOOD PANTRIES THAT ARE NOT COMMONLY USED BY THEIR CULTURES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PREPARE THEM, AND THEY ARE NOT CONSUMED. TO INCREASE THIS PERCENTAGE, PARAPROFESSIONALS WILL FOCUS EDUCATION ON THIS AREA AND EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING VEGETABLE INTAKE AND INCORPORATE TASTE-TESTING OF NJ EFNEP RECIPES, WHICH INCLUDE A VARIETY OF VEGETABLES FOUND IN FOOD PANTRIES. PARTICIPANTS WILL ALSO BE INSTRUCTED TO GO TO THE EFNEPHELPS.ORG WEBSITE WHERE THEY CAN FIND QUICK, EASY, AND LOW-COST RECIPES WHICH INCORPORATE A VARIETY OF VEGETABLES FOUND AT FOOD PANTRIES. TEACHING OBSERVATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF WHO EVALUATE THE PARAPROFESSIONALS\u2019 WORK AND PROVIDE THEM WITH FEEDBACK. IF NECESSARY ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR THE EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF THIS TOPIC IS PROVIDED. IN FFY 2019 OUR DATA SHOWED THAT 49% OF THE ADULT PARTICIPANTS SERVED BY NJ EFNEP ATE VEGETABLES MORE OFTEN EACH DAY. LAST YEAR 89% OF NJ EFNEP CLASSES WERE CONDUCTED VIRTUALLY, HENCE PARAPROFESSIONALS WERE NOT ABLE TO INCORPORATE THE TASTE-TESTING COMPONENT IN THEIR CLASSES, AND DATA SHOWED THAT ONLY 38% OF ADULT PARTICIPANTS ATE VEGETABLES MORE OFTEN EACH DAY. THIS YEAR MANY OF THE NJ EFNEP SITES ARE REQUESTING IN PERSON CLASSES, THEREFORE TASTE-TESTING WILL ONCE AGAIN BE INCORPORATED IN THE LESSONS, AND EFFORTS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE PERCENTAGE ADULTS WHO MORE OFTEN EAT VEGETABLES EACH DAY TO 51%. PROGRESS WILL BE MEASURED THROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE DATA WHICH IS FOUND IN THE \u201c3.02 EAT VEGETABLES MORE OFTEN EACH DAY\u201d SECTION OF THE EFNEP ADULT FOOD AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR QUESTIONNAIRE FOUND IN THE ADULT QUESTIONNAIRE SUMMARY REPORT IN WEBNEERS.  ANOTHER ISSUE AMONG NJ RESIDENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY ONE ON WHICH NJ EFNEP WILL WORK, IS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM THE NJ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (2017) INDICATED THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO MET THE RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN THE TOTAL POPULATIONWAS 49.2%, WITH BLACKS AND HISPANICS ONLY BEING ACTIVE 41.3% AND 41.2%, RESPECTIVELY. THERE ARE LIKELY MANY REASONS FOR THIS ISSUE. MANY LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS LIVE IN UNSAFE AREAS AND DO NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO JOIN A GYM. OTHERS LIVE IN SMALL APARTMENTS WITH LITTLE SPACE FOR ACTIVITY AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS WHO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS, PARAPROFESSIONALS USE THE WALK INDOORS! DVD TO INCORPORATE A DIFFERENT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SEGMENT, ALL WALKING INDOORS BUT SOMETIMES USING HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS FOR WEIGHTS OR DOING INTERVALS, ETC., IN EACH OF THE ADULT LESSONS. PARAPROFESSIONALS ALSO DIRECT PARTICIPANTS TO THE EFNEPHELPS.ORG WEBSITE WHERE THEY CAN ACCESS THE VIDEOS AND CONTINUE THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ROUTINE WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE COMFORT OF THEIR HOMES AT NO COST. IN FFY 2019 NJ EFNEP PARTICIPANTS\u2019 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY RATE WAS LOW (74%) COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL DATA AVERAGE (78%). LAST YEAR 67% OF ADULT PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN ONE OR MORE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS. THIS YEAR EFFORTS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THIS PERCENTAGE UNTIL THE NATIONAL DATA AVERAGE OF 78% HAS BEEN MET. PROGRESS WILL BE MEASURED THROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE DATA WHICH  IS FOUND IN THE \u201c1.3 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY\u201d SECTION OF THE EFNEP ADULT FOOD AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR QUESTIONNAIRE IN THE ADULT QUESTIONNAIRE SUMMARY REPORT OF WEBNEERS. OF NOTE, COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM WITHIN THE ADULT PARTICIPANTS IS OFTEN CHALLENGING. MANY TIMES, PARTICIPANTS CANNOT ATTEND CLASSES DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS, LACK OF TRANSPORTATION, AND THE INABILITY TO FIND CHILDCARE, WHICH RESULTS IN LOW NJ EFNEP COURSE SERIES\u2019 COMPLETION RATES. IN FFY 2019 ONLY 55% OF THE ADULTS WHO STARTED AN NJ EFNEP CLASS SERIES COMPLETED IT. WHEREAS, THE NATIONAL DATA AVERAGE FOR EFNEP COMPLETION IN OTHER STATES IS 67%. TO INCREASE THE RATE OF ADULT GRADUATION IN NJ, PROFESSIONAL STAFF HAVE CREATED INTERACTIVE, LIVE, VIRTUAL EDUCATION AND TRAINED THE PARAPROFESSIONALS TO DELIVER EDUCATION VIA ZOOM. LAST YEAR NJ EFNEP ADULT GRADUATION RATE IMPROVED TO 62%. THIS YEAR WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE ADULT GRADUATION RATES BY AN ADDITIONAL 2%. PROGRESS WILL BE MEASURED THROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE DATA REGARDING WHO COMPLETED THE PROGRAM, FOUND IN THE STATUS OF PARTICIPANTS SECTION OF THE ADULT SUMMARY REPORT IN WEBNEERS. WHILE MUCH OF NJ EFNEP\u2019S EFFORTS FOCUSES ON ADULTS, AS THEY ARE CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES\u2019 DIETARY INTAKE, OUR SECONDARY TARGET AUDIENCES WILL BE HIGH SCHOOL-AGED TEENS AND EMERGENT ADULTS (I.E., RECENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES) SINCE THEY MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THEIR OWN DECISIONS. IN FFY 2022 THE TOTAL NUMBER OF YOUTH SERVED BY NJ EFNEP WAS 1,068. OF THIS TOTAL, ONLY 28% WERE HIGH SCHOOLERS. IN THE NEXT YEAR NJ EFNEP PLANS TO INCREASE THIS PERCENTAGE. PROGRESS WILL BE MEASURED ACCORDING TO THE DATA WHICH IS FOUND IN THE GRADE DISTRIBUTION SECTION OF THE YOUTH SUMMARY REPORT IN WEBNEERS. WHEN WORKING WITH ADOLESCENTS IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY NUTRITION ISSUES IS A HIGH INTAKE OF SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES. WHILE IT HAS DECREASED SOMEWHAT, THEIR INTAKE REMAINS HIGH. TO DECREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR ADOLESCENT PARTICIPANTS WHO REGULARLY CONSUME SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES, PARAPROFESSIONALS UNIVERSALLY TEACH INTERACTIVE, HANDS-ON, AND FUN LESSONS FROM THE REV IT UP! TEEN CURRICULUM THAT ARE PERTINENT TO THIS BEHAVIOR CHANGE. IN FFY 2019, THE NJ EFNEP YOUTH SUMMARY REPORTS DATA INDICATED THAT 29% OF PROGRAM HIGH SCHOOL AGED ADOLESCENTS, IMPROVED IN THEIR RESPONSES TO THE QUESTION \u201cYESTERDAY, HOW MANY SUGARY DRINKS DID YOU DRINK?\u201d LAST YEAR DATA REFLECTED THAT 43% OF THE HIGH SCHOOLERS REACHED IMPROVED IN THEIR RESPONSES TO THIS QUESTION. THIS YEAR NJ EFNEP WILL CONTINUE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THESE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO DECREASE THEIR SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGE INTAKE BY 1% PER YEAR. PROGRESS WILL BE MEASURED THROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE DATA WHICH IS FOUND IN QUESTION #4 ON THE 9-12 SURVEY FOUND IN THE YOUTH QUESTIONNAIRE SUMMARY REPORT OF WEBNEERS. IN ADDITION TO THE WORK NJ EFNEP DOES WITH INDIVIDUALS, OUR PROFESSIONAL STAFF ENGAGE IN NATIONAL COLLABORATIONS TO ENHANCE PROGRAMMING. THE EFNEP COORDINATORS IN THE NORTHEAST REGION MEET ON A REGULAR BASIS TO WORK TOGETHER TOWARDS SUCH IMPROVEMENTS. IN TERMS OF COLLABORATIONS WITHIN NJ, PROFESSIONAL LEVEL STAFF WILL ATTEND THE NJ CENTER FOR FOOD AND ACTION'S NJ FOOD FOR THOUGHT CAMPAIGN MEETINGS WHERE THEY WILL PARTICIPATE IN NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET IMPORTANT STATE ENTITIES AND INCREASE VISIBILITY OF OUR PROGRAM.  IN FFY 2022, THE SR. PROJECT ADMINISTRATOR JOINED THE NJ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S HEALTHY 2030: HEALTHY EATING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ACTION TEAM, WHOSE CHARGE IT WAS TO ENSURE ACTIVITIES THAT HELP MEET THE STATE'S 2030 HEALTHY PEOPLE OBJECTIVES. IN THESE MEETINGS COLLABORATIONS WERE EXPANDED, AS THEY HAVE BEEN BY STAFF ATTENDING MORE HEALTH FAIRS. THESE COLLABORATION GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES WILL CONTINUE. ONE EXAMPLE OF THE COLLABORATIONS ESTABLISHED WAS ONE WITH THE MAYOR OF PATERSON. NJ EFNEP IS COLLABORATING AS PART OF THE MAYOR\u2019S WELLNESS CAMPAIGN. CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES TO BE CONDUCTED WERE PUT ON HOLD DUE TO COVID, BUT NEW EFFORTS ARE ON THE WAY, WITH SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES YET TO BE DETERMINED.

WYOMING EFNEP PROMOTES HEALTHY BEHAVIORS FOR ELIGIBLE ADULTS AND YOUTH RESULTING IN BETTER NUTRITION, INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND IMPROVED OVERALL HEALTH. WYOMING EFNEP FOCUSES ON IMPROVING DIET QUALITY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS AND MYPLATE USING A SERIES OF LESSONS. THE LESSONS ALSO INCORPORATE FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, FOOD SAFETY AND FOOD SECURITY. THROUGH THE SERIES OF LESSONS, WYOMING EFNEP EMPOWERS THE LOW-INCOME FAMILY AND INDIVIDUAL TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. WYOMING EFNEP PARTNERS WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO INCREASE REFERRALS ACROSS PROGRAMS, ORGANIZATIONS, AND COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS PARTICIPANT NEEDS WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING COORDINATION, COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION TO ACCOMPLISH STATE AND LOCAL PRIORITIES. EFNEP\u2019S TARGET ADULT AUDIENCE IS DEFINED AS LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON PARENTS AND OTHER ADULT CAREGIVERS WITH PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FEEDING YOUNG CHILDREN; PREGNANT TEENS, YOUTH, AND CHILDREN. PRIMARY RECRUITMENT LOCATIONS IN WYOMING INCLUDE THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY SERVICES OFFICES, WIC OFFICES, COUNSELING AND REHABILITATION CENTERS, FOOD BANKS, LOW-INCOME HOUSING COMMUNITY CENTERS, GROCERY STORES IN LOW-INCOME AREAS, LOW-INCOME SCHOOLS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY AGENCIES SERVING LIMITED RESOURCE AUDIENCES. REFERRALS FROM THESE AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT SERVE THE TARGET AUDIENCE ARE ALSO ENCOURAGED. THE PROGRAM IS OPEN TO LIMITED-INCOME (ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES) INDIVIDUALS WITH CHILDREN, AND PREGNANT WOMEN AND TEENS WHO SHOP FOR AND PREPARE FOOD FOR CHILDREN ON A REGULAR BASIS. A FAMILY ENROLLED IN ANY OTHER FEDERAL NUTRITION PROGRAM IS ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR EFNEP (FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE USING WIC, SNAP, TANF, FREE/REDUCED SCHOOL MEALS, HEADSTART, ETC.). YOUTH AUDIENCES INCLUDELIMITED RESOURCE CHILDREN OF ELIGIBLE ADULT PARTICIPANTS, OR STUDENTS IN TITLE I (LOW INCOME) SCHOOLS THAT HAVE 50% OR GREATER FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH PARTICIPATION. THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS REACHED THROUGH RECRUITMENT AND DEMONSTRATIONS AT AGENCIES SERVING LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. RECRUITING AND DEMONSTRATING LESSONS AT SITES AND LOCATIONS THAT THE TARGET AUDIENCE FREQUENTS IS A MEANS OF BOTH REACHING POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM, AND ALSO ENGAGING THEM IN A WAY THAT HELPS TO BUILD RAPPORT TO INCREASE CHANCES OF FULL PARTICIPATION AND GRADUATION.

THEY WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND COLLABORATIVELY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS IN ALL 95 COUNTIES AND TO SERVE THE STATES 6.9 MILLION PEOPLE. THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE IS BASED IN KNOXVILLE AND SERVES AS THE STATES 1862 INSTITUTION. IT INCLUDES THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT EXTENSION) AND THE TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (UT AGRESEARCH). BASED IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY (TSU) IS THE STATES 1890 INSTITUTION; IT INCLUDES THE TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. THIS PLAN OF WORK REPRESENTS THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF UT EXTENSION, UT AGRESEARCH, TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM, AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH.  AGRICULTURE IS INTEGRAL TO TENNESSEES ECONOMY AND CULTURE. ALMOST ONE OF EVERY EIGHT TO NINE DOLLARS GENERATED IN THE STATE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE OR AN INDUSTRY THAT GENERATES PRODUCTS FROM A NATURAL RESOURCE - MORE THAN $79.3 BILLION ANNUALLY. THE STATES AGRICULTURAL AND RELATED EXPORTS TOTALED $2.2 BILLION IN 2021, UP $325 MILLION OR 17% WHEN COMPARED TO 2020. TENNESSEE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN ALL MAJOR COMMODITY CATEGORIES IN 2021. FARM RECEIPTS TOTALED $3.6 BILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 65.5% OF THIS VALUE COMING FROM CROPS AND 34.5% FROM ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC SUCCESSES OF TENNESSEE AGRICULTURE, 339,400 TENNESSEANS ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED BY AGRICULTURAL OR NATURAL RESOURCE INDUSTRIES, MAKING EFFECTIVE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS CRITICAL. TENNESSEES LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS CONDUCT RESEARCH AND PROVIDE EXTENSION OUTREACH IN FIVE KEY AREAS TO ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THE STATE: SUPPORTING FOOD, FIBER, AND ENERGY SYSTEMS; ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; ENRICHING OUR ECONOMY; DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE; ANDSTRENGTHENING OUR HEALTH. RESEARCH PROJECTS PROVIDE NEW KNOWLEDGE TO HELP STAKEHOLDERS ADDRESS ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEM. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES SHARE THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ULTIMATELY TO RESULT IN A CHANGE IN ACTION OR CONDITION.  EXTENSION WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING NEEDS CITIZENS AND AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS ACROSS THE STATE. HEALTH ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE TOP CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. EXTENSION WILL STRENGTHEN HEALTH PROGRAMMING BY OFFERING THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR IMPROVING DIETARY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR LIMITED-RESOURCE TENNESSEANS. EXTENSION LIVESTOCK AND FORAGE PROGRAMS STRENGTHEN OUR EXTENSION AND RESEARCH FOR THE STATES LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS, RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL WILL JOINTLY IMPLEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH IN HAY SCHOOLS, LATE GESTATION NUTRITION, MARKETING, FORAGE TESTING, AND STOCKPILED FORAGES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION HAS DEVELOPED PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN AND PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED OPPORTUNITIES FORPRODUCERS.THE UT CENTER FOR FARM MANAGEMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS IN 2022. THE CENTER FACILITATES EXTENSION, TEACHING, AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS ON FARM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. THE CENTER WILL FOCUS ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF TENNESSEE PRODUCERS AND ENHANCING LONG-TERM PROFITABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURE ENTERPRISES. THROUGH THE CROPS PRODUCTION SYSTEMS EXTENSIONS PROVIDE DEMONSTRATION AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT BENEFITS PRODUCERS. THE CROP VARIETY TRIALS FOR CORN GRAIN, SILAGE, AND SOYBEANS AS WELL AS PRODUCER EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR CORN, SOYBEANS, COTTON, WHEAT, AND TOBACCO PRODUCTION ARE KEY AREAS. THE CONSUMER ECONOMICS PROGRAM HELPS FAMILIES INCREASE SAVINGS, DECREASE DEBT, AND FINANCIALLY PLAN. THE ON MY OWN  AND 4-H WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED FOR YOUTH AND ADULTS THAT PROVIDE NEEDED SKILLS, TRAININGS, AND EXPERIENCES TO PARTICIPANTS. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OF TOP PRIORITYFOR EXTENSION.  EXTENSION CONTINUES DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE AND PROVIDE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE NEXT CHAPTER PROGRAM IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND TENNESSEE 4-H. IN CREATING THIS PROGRAM, WE WANT TO CREATE AN EARLY DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT SKILLS ARE NECESSARY FOR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BOTH THEIR SECONDARY AND POSTSECONDARY PLANS. 4-H CONTINUES PROGRAMING ON HONING STEM AND CITIZENSHIP/LEADERSHIP SKILLS.  UT AGRESEARCH CONDUCTS RESEARCH WITHIN ITS EIGHT ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND SEVEN PHYSICAL CENTERS, AND AT TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS (REC) LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE UNITS HELP DRIVE PLANNED RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND FACILITATE FACULTY RESEARCH PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO A DECADE OF EXCELLENCE: TEN-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR UTIA, 2018-2028 , AGRESEARCH OPERATES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF ITS 2021-2024 AGRESEARCH STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN WITH THE OBJECTIVES TO BALANCE A PORTFOLIO OF INTEGRATED, INTER-DISCIPLINARY PROGRAMS,CULTISION LIVESTOCK FARMING (PLF). THE PROGRAM INCORPORATES BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT ULTIMATELY WILL CONTRIBUTE INFORMATION TO REFINE STRATEGIES THAT OFFER CARBON REDUCTIONS OVER TODAY\u2019S AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS. AGRESEARCH IS REALIGNING THE CAPABILITIES AT TWO OF ITS TEN REC TO FACILITATE PLF INITIATIVE. THE LITTLE RIVER ANIMAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT PLANS TO HAVE MILKING ROBOTS IN OPERATION BY LATE FALL 2022, AND THE MIDDLE TENNESSEE REC IS RETOOLING TO SUPPORT PRECISION BEEF AND POULTRY PRODUCTION RESEARCH. ALSO, EXPANDED ACTIVITY IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE WILL RESPOND TO CONCERNS OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION.  THE TRANSFORMATIONAL AGRICULTURAL GENOMICS AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY PROGRAM WILL ADVANCE ANIMAL AND PLANT-BASED PRODUCTIVITY. ALTHOUGH EARLY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT, THE INITIATIVE ALREADY ENGAGES FACULTY TO ADVANCE STATE-OF-THE-ART SCIENCE TO DESIGN CROPS THAT ARE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. FINALLY, THE BIOECONOMY ADVANCEMENT INITIATIVE IS AN ESTABLISHED INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABLE FUELS, CHEMICALS, AND MATERIALS. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IS EXPANDING RESEARCH CAPABILITIES IN SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AGGRESSIVE GRAND CHALLENGE GOALS ANNOUNCED BY THE WHITE HOUSE.  MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PROCESSES  TENNESSEE EXTENSION PROGRAMS FUNDED BY SMITH-LEVER OR NARETPA SECTION 1444 AND 1445 REQUIRE A MERIT REVIEW PROCESS. A PANEL OF EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS, PROGRAM LEADERS AND SCHOLARS FROM FOUR STATES REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TENNESSEE EXTENSION MERIT REVIEW CRITERIA. CRITERIA INCLUDES ASSESSING NEEDS, DELIVERY METHODS, IMPLEMENTATION STEPS, EVALUATION, ENSURING DIVERSITY AND DEFINED OUTCOMES. UT AND TSU COORDINATE MERIT REVIEW PROCESSES. STATE EXTENSION SPECIALISTS PROPOSE PLANNED PROGRAMS. ALL PROPOSED PROGRAMS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY A REVIEW TEAM OF UT EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS AND SPECIALISTS.  UT AGRESEARCH WILL UTILIZE THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE IT HAS PROVEN TO BE BOTH EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. HATCH REGULAR AND HATCH/MULTI-STATE RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERGO A REVIEW PROCESS FOR MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS, AND TO ENSURE ALIGNMENT WITH ESTABLISHED RESEARCH PRIORITIES. THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR HATCH REGULAR RESEARCH PROJECTS BEGINS INFORMALLY WITH DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PROJECT DIRECTOR, COLLEAGUES, THE DEPARTMENT HEAD, AND, IF APPLICABLE, AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS (IF FIELD WORK IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT). A REVIEW PANEL OF THREE SCIENTISTS THEN EVALUATES THE PROPOSAL FOR CLARITY, TECHNICAL RELEVANCE, AND SCIENTIFIC MERIT. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR MAKES ANY NECESSARY REVISIONS AND SUBMITS THE PROPOSAL TO THE DEPARTMENT HEAD FOR REVIEW. IF APPROVED, THE DEAN/DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH THEN CONDUCTS A FINAL EVALUATION AND ENDORSES THE PROPOSAL FOR SUBMISSION TO NIFA.  HATCH/MULTI-STATE PROJECTS GO THROUGH A COMPARATIVELY MORE EXTENSIVE REVIEW AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL, SO THE INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS IS ABBREVIATED. THE FACULTY MEMBER OFFICIALLY JOINS A MULTI- STATE PROJECT AFTER CONSULTING WITH COLLEAGUES AND, IF APPLICABLE, THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR THEN SUBMITS A PROPOSAL REFLECTING THE UT COMPONENT DIRECTLY TO THE ASSOCIATE DEAN/ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT. ONCE THE REVIEW IS COMPLETE AND ANY NECESSARY CHANGES ARE MADE, THE RESEARCHER SUBMITS THE PROJECT TO NIFA.  STAKEHOLDER INPUT  UT EXTENSION PURSUED MULTIPLE DATA COLLECTIONS FOR THIS PLAN OF WORK. ALL 95 COUNTIES HAVE LOCAL EXTENSION ADVISORY GROUPS THAT PROVIDE ONGOING STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE UT-TSU EXTENSION STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL REVIEWS AND UPDATES PLANS BI-ANNUALLY. EXTENSIVE STRATEGIC PLAN ACTIVITIES ALSO INFORMED THIS PLAN. EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND STATE AGENCY LEADERS PARTICIPATED IN SURVEYS, LISTENING SESSIONS AND FOCUS GROUPS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW EXTENSION COULD ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. BASED ON THIS INPUT, THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL IDENTIFIED PLAN PRIORITIES. NEW STATE ACTION AGENDAS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS PRIORITIES. PLANS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE PROGRESS AND MAKE CHANGES.  UT AGRESEARCH CONTINUES TO SEEK STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THROUGH SEVERAL MEANS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR TO DISCUSS AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES, UTIA PROGRAM PRIORITIES, AND HOW UTIA, INCLUDING UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION, MAY RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES. SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE TENNESSEE FARM BUREAU, AND SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE  TENNESSEE STATE GOVERNMENT ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF COMMON RESEARCH INTERESTS. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS SERVE THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS AT THE INVITATION OF THE DEPARTMENT HEAD AND CENTER DIRECTOR, RESPECTIVELY, TO PROVIDE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES. FACULTY HELP DRIVE THE UT AGRESEARCH AGENDA BY REMAINING ABREAST OF EMERGING RESEARCH AND ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, PROGRAM LEADERS WITH STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING AGENCIES, THE PUBLIC, AND AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE UT SYSTEM IS COMPLETING A SURVEY THAT WENT STATEWIDE REGARDING PUBLIC INPUT INTO THE GRAND CHALLENGES FACING TENNESSEE. THIS WAS A UT SYSTEM EFFORT, BUT UT EXTENSION AND UT AGRESEARCH ASSISTED IN SHARING THE SURVEY ACROSS TENNESSEE AND THE RESULTS WILL CERTAINLY ADD TO THE INFORMATION WE USE TO DETERMINE DIRECTIONS FOR OUR WORK.  UT AND TSU EXTENSION WILL EMPLOY THEIR EXTENSIVE, STATEWIDE NETWORK OF ADVISORY GROUPS FOR STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL PROVIDES INPUT AND DIRECTION FOR STATEWIDE INITIATIVES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION AGENTS WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON INVOLVING YOUTH AND OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES. ALL OF TENNESSEE'S 95 COUNTIES HAVE A COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE OF SEVEN LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, NOMINATED BY THE COUNTY MAYOR AND APPROVED BY MAJORITY VOTE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSION. EVERY COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEETS FOUR TIMES ANNUALLY, AND THEIR DUTIES INCLUDE INPUT INTO HIRING DECISIONS, LOCAL FUNDING, AND LOCAL PROGRAMMING.  UT AGRESEARCH IMPLEMENTS SEVERAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS FOR INPUT. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE STATE GOVERNMENT, AND THE COMMUNITY. IT HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP ON RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION ISSUES. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS ARE COMPRISED OF THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE AND DEANS, REPRESENTATIVES FROM TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY GROUPS, AND CLIENTELE SERVED BY UTIA PROGRAMS. UTIA PERSONNEL NOMINATE THE COMMODITY GROUP AND CLIENTELE MEMBERS. EACH OF THE THREE REGIONAL ADVISORY GROUPS ELECTS A CHAIR TO GUIDE MEETINGS. IN ADDITION, UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. AS NEW PRIORITIES ARISE, THESE GROUPS SEEK OUT ONE ANOTHER TO DISCUSS COMMON RESEARCH NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS FOR THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS\u2019 AND GROUPS\u2019 RELEVANT BACKGROUND, EXPERTISE, AND COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. UT AGRESEARCH FACULTY REGULARLY INTERACT WITH THEIR PEERS AT PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND THROUGH JOINT PROJECT VENTURES. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS ENCOURAGE FACULTY TO MEET WITH PROGRAM LEADERS AT STATE AND NATIONAL FUNDING AGENCIES TO DISCUSS RESEARCH PRIORITIES. ADDITIONALLY, FACULTY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET WITH THE PUBLIC DURING AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER FIELD DAY EVENTS.  TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT/TSU) AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS ARE TRAINED IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES AND HOW TO SELECT INDIVIDUALS FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES. COMMUNITY LEADERS SELECTED FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSITIES (I.E., GENDER, AGE, RACIAL/ETHNIC, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, EDUCATIONAL, ETC.) OF THE COUNTY OR AREA SERVED. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE CONDUCTS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR (SPECIFIC TO UT EXTENSION). EXTENSION  AGENTS RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PAST AND CURRENT EXTENSION PROGRAMS; AND THEY RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT USED EXTENSION TO SERVE ON LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND PARTICIPATE IN OPEN LISTENING SESSIONS. EXTENSION AGENTS ALSO CONDUCT SURVEYS ON PLANNED PROGRAM AREAS.  UT AGRESEARCH COLLECTS INPUT THROUGH REGULAR CONTACT WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE AND THE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR. THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE RESPONDS TO ANY ISSUES RAISED, AND, AS APPROPRIATE, MAY DELEGATE ACTION TO THE DEANS/DIRECTORS OF UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS MEET WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THEY HAVE FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS WITH THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT HEADS AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS WITH THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER DIRECTORS MONTHLY; COLLECTIVELY THEY MEET ONCE PER YEAR. THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS MEET WITH THEIR ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS ANNUALLY AND SHARE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WITH AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY AS APPROPRIATE. FACULTY ATTEND PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND READ SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND POPULAR PRESS ARTICLES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. DEPARTMENTS HOLD MONTHLY FACULTY MEETINGS WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS WITH PEERS AND THEIR DEPARTMENT HEAD.  STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES AT LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND STATEWIDE LEVEL MONITOR AND ADJUST DEPLOYMENT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, THE OPINIONS FROM MANY TENNESSEANS, INCLUDING DECISION-MAKERS, CLIENTELE, PARTNERS, AND VOLUNTEERS WERE CONSIDERED. MORE THAN 120 STAKEHOLDERS AND 490 UT EXTENSION EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATED IN THE REGIONAL AND CAMPUS LISTENING SESSIONS. THE PLANNING EFFORT ALSO INCLUDED AN ONLINE SURVEY COMPONENT. UT EXTENSION WILL ADDRESS THE INCREASING URBANIZATION AND A LOSS OF FARMLAND IN THE STATE ARE CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. OUR NURSERY, FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTION PROGRAMS WILL PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON PLANT, PEST, AND SOIL DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. THE CENTER FOR PROFITABLE AGRICULTURE WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON THE STATE'S AGRITOURISM INDUSTRY AND VALUE-ADDED PROGRAMS.

PROJECT ABSTRACT  THE WELFARE OF ADULTS, YOUTH, AND CHILDREN IN LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED, AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OHIO IS A CRITICAL PRIORITY FOR CENTRAL STATE UNIVERSITY (CSU) EXTENSION. PARENTS, PREGNANT WOMEN, AND YOUTH IN THESE COMMUNITIES ARE OFTEN AT A GREATER RISK OF POOR NUTRITION AND SUBSEQUENT ILLNESSES WITH LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES. FOR ADULTS THESE INCLUDE CHRONIC DISEASES INCLUDING DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL. FOR YOUTH RISK SUCH AS IMPAIRED OR POOR BRAIN AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT, LEARNING DISABILITIES, DECREASED IMMUNITY, INCREASED INFECTIONS AND OBESITY ARE, AMONG OTHERS.  THE UNITED STATES SPENDS $200 BILLION IN HEALTHCARE RELATED TO OBESITY, AND MORE THAN 81 MILLION AMERICANS ARE COMPLETELY INACTIVE AND LACK PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. OHIO HAS THE 11TH HIGHEST ADULT OBESITY RATE IN THE NATION, AND THE SIXTH HIGHEST OBESITY RATE FOR YOUTH AGES 10 TO 17. OBESITY IN CHILDREN IS A GROWING EPIDEMIC IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE MINORITY POPULATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY AT RISK FOR OBESITY. HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS AND OVERALL POPULATIONS ENCOMPASS MANY FACTORS: BEHAVIORAL, ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, CULTURAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND GENETIC. DIET AND NUTRITION ARE IMPORTANT TO OVERALL HEALTH. DISEASES RELATED TO OBESITY, SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES, NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES, AND FOOD INSECURITY, ARE MAJOR DIETARY HEALTH CONCERNS IN THE U.S.  CSU EXTENSION USES RESEARCHED, EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULUMS, AND STRATEGIES TO TEACH PARTICIPANTS IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES HOW TO MI TIGATE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BY LEARNING FOOD SELECTION, BUDGETING, MEAL PREPARATION, FOOD STORAGE, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO HELP THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES BECOME HEALTHIER.

ALMOST 62% OF SNAP PARTICIPANTS ARE FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WHICH IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR NEVADA'S ADULT EFNEP PROGRAM. OUR SECOND TARGET AUDIENCE IN NEVADA IS YOUTH/CHILDREN IN 5TH AND 6TH GRADES.  FOR OUR ADULT PARTICIPANTS, NEVADA USES THE HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING CURRICULUM, EATING SMART, BEING ACTIVE. EATING SMART, BEING ACTIVE IS DESIGNED TO TEACH THE MAIN MESSAGE OF THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS AND THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS WITH THE GOAL OF ASSISTING FAMILIES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES IN ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ATTITUDES AND CHANGED-BEHAVIOR NECESSARY FOR NUTRITIONALLY SOUND DIETS. THIS IN TURN CONTRIBUTES TO PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE TOTAL FAMILY DIET AND NUTRITIONAL WELL-BEING. THE CURRICULUM HAS BEEN UPDATED TO COMPLY WITH THE CURRENT 2020-2025 DIETARY GUIDELINES AND THE 2018 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES.  LESSON CONTENT INCLUDES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, NUTRITION, HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES, FOOD PREPARATION (COOKING SKILL DEVELOPMENT), FOOD SAFETY, AND FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. DEPENDING ON THE AUDIENCE, THE LESSON CONTENT ALSO INCLUDES EATING SMART AND BEING ACTIVE DURING PREGNANCY, FEEDING NEW BABIES AND FEEDING BABIES SOLID FOODS.

IT IS COMPRISED OF 62 COUNTIES WITH POPULATIONS RANGING FROM LESS THAN 5,000 TO OVER 2.5 MILLION (1). NYS HAS A DIVERSE POPULATION: 12.3% ASIAN, 24.6% BLACK, 43.7% WHITE, 28.8% HISPANIC (4). POVERTY BY COUNTY RANGES FROM 4.8% - 29.7% (5); BUT EXTREMELY POOR COMMUNITIES HAVE RATES OF UP TO 48% IN KIRYAS JOEL (BRONX), 43% IN ITHACA (TOMPKINS COUNTY), 33% IN BINGHAMTON (BROOME COUNTY), AND 30% IN BUFFALO (ERIE COUNTY)(4). STATEWIDE, 21% OF CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18 LIVE IN POVERTY - 803,000 CHILDREN (5). IN ADDITION, 47.5% OF CHILDREN RECEIVE FREE OR REDUCED COST LUNCH; (74.9% OF CHILDREN IN NEW YORK CITY AND 31.7% OF CHILDREN IN THE REST OF THE STATE) (6). THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF CHILDREN LIVE IN SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS. OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY RATES FOR ADULTS (60.5%) AND CHILDREN (35.8%) ARE OF GRAVE CONCERN (7), AS THESE CONDITIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS, INCLUDING DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND HEART DISEASE. PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM A VARIETY OF CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS, BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL. WHILE ONLY ONE COMPONENT OF THE OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY ISSUE, AND ONE OF A HOST OF CONCERNS FOR PEOPLE IN POVERTY, NUTRITION EDUCATION CAN MITIGATE BOTH. COVID-19 CONTINUED TO IMPACT PROGRAMMING ACROSS NEW YORK STATE IN FFY2022. MORE RURAL AREAS OF NEW YORK BEGAN TO RETURN TO IN-PERSON EDUCATION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2022, WHILE URBAN PROGRAMS HAVE CONTINUED TO REACH PARTICIPANTS VIRTUALLY. AS 2022 CONTINUES, PROGRAM STAFF ARE WORKING TO STRENGTHEN EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILD NEW, AS MANY OF THE AGENCIES WHERE EDUCATION HAS BEEN OFFERED HAVE EXPERIENCED STAFF TURN-OVER AND/OR CHANGE IN OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE SPEED OF A RETURN TO \u2018NORMAL\u2019 .  HISTORICALLY, IN NEW YORK, WE HAVE MAINTAINED A COMMITMENT TO A STATEWIDE EFNEP PROGRAM. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND CONTINUE TO REFINE A COUNTY FUNDING FORMULA THAT INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEVELS OF POVERTY AND POPULATION DENSITY. HOWEVER, CONTINUATION OF LOCAL PROGRAM FUNDING IS CONTINGENT ON SUCCESSFUL ACHIEVEMENT OF PROGRAM OUTPUTS. ADDITIONALLY, COUNTY PROGRAMMING IS DETERMINED BY LOCAL BOARDS OF DIRECTORS. WE WORK IN CONCERT WITH COUNTIES THAT HAVE DETERMINED THAT NUTRITION EDUCATION FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES IS A PRIORITY PROGRAM AREA. GIVEN THE STATIC FEDERAL EFNEP ALLOCATION AND INCREASING COST OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS, THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT CAN BE FUNDED HAS BEEN REDUCED SINCE THE LAST 5-YEAR PLAN. EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AN EFNEP PRESENCE IN THE COUNTIES WITH THE HIGHEST NEED HAS BEEN A PRIORITY. AS A RESULT, 50% OF OUR PROGRAM FUNDS ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND POPULATION IN METROPOLITAN NYC AND LONG ISLAND.  COMMUNICATION WITH STATE LEVEL ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES HAS REMAINED CONSISTENT AND ONGOING AND WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. THE EFNEP COORDINATOR AND SNAP-ED STATE COORDINATOR SCHEDULE PERIODIC CALLS TO COORDINATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, USE OF NUTRITION EDUCATION MATERIALS AND DISCUSS STRATEGIES FOR POLICY, SYSTEM, AND ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. ACROSS THE STATE, EFNEP REGIONAL COORDINATORS WILL CONTINUE TO NETWORK WITH BOTH PROGRAMS TO ENSURE QUALITY NUTRITION EDUCATION IS PROVIDED TO PROGRAM SPECIFIC AUDIENCES. CAMPUS LEADERSHIP WILL COLLABORATE WITH NYS SNAP LEADERSHIP TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT WITH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, CONSULTATION ON INITIATIVES AND TRAINING AS NEEDED TO ENSURE QUALITY PROGRAMMING THROUGH LGU SNAP-ED PROGRAMS. SOME AGENCIES IMPLEMENTED STRICT COVID GUIDELINES, LIMITING ACCESS AND MAKING DIRECT CONTACT WITH PARTICIPANTS CHALLENGING. INCONSISTENCIES IN POST-COVID PROTOCOLS HAS HAMPERED BOTH RECRUITMENT AND LESSON DELIVERY.  THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR EFNEP IN NYS IS LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN LIVING AT OR BELOW 185% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL; AND LOW INCOME, 4-H AGED YOUTH. COUNTY STRATEGIES ARE TAILORED TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, EDUCATION, AND GRADUATION OF PROGRAM ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS. COOPERATION WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS, AGENCIES PROVIDING SERVICE TO THE TARGET POPULATIONS, AND COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO CAN PROVIDE INSIGHT AND GUIDANCE REGARDING LOCATIONS WHERE THE TARGET AUDIENCE LIVES AND WORKS, IS A PROVEN STRATEGY. STAFF ARE ENCOURAGED TO FORGE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY COMMUNITY LEADERS TO ENSURE THAT OUTREACH IS RELEVANT AND APPROPRIATE. GIVEN THE NATURE OF NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAMMING TO LOW-INCOME AUDIENCES IN NYS, THERE IS LITTLE CONCERN FOR DUPLICATION OF SERVICES. STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING SOCIAL MEDIA AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY NATIONAL EFNEP WORKGROUPS IN WHICH NEW YORK STAFF ARE PARTICIPATING AND WILL BE PILOTED IN A VARIETY OF LOCATIONS DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN EXTEND THE REACH OF THE PROGRAM, BOLSTER ENROLLMENTS AND INCREASE GRADUATION NUMBERS. INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND SUPPORTS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO INSTITUTIONALIZE COLLABORATIONS WITH PARTNER AGENCIES AND COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. THE TRADITIONAL EFNEP ADULT PROGRAM WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE EDUCATION FOR FOSTER CHILDREN WHO ARE AGEING OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND INTO YOUNG ADULTHOOD. THIS AUDIENCE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY FOR EDUCATION TO PREPARE THEM WITH THE SKILLS TAUGHT THROUGH EFNEP TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF ADULTHOOD.

EFNEP IS FUNDED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA)/ NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND A GRICULTURE AND BRINGS TOGETHER FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL RESOURCES TO TEACH LIMITED-INCOME FAMILIES AND YOUTH ABOUT HEALTHY EATING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.  EFNEP HELPS FAMILIES LEARN SKILLS AND STRATEGIES TO FEED THEIR FAMILY NUTRITIOUS MEALS ON A LIMITED BUDGET, MAKE HEALTHIER FOOD CHOICES AT HOME AND AT THE GROCERY STORE, IMPROVE FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVE THEIR OVERALL HEALTH. THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS ACQUIRED ALSO HELP FAMILIES AND YOUTH CHANGE BEHAVIORS THAT PLACE THEM AT LONG-TERM RISK FOR OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY AND CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS DIABETES, HEART DISEASE AND CERTAIN CANCERS THE EXPANDED FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM (EFNEP) IN MARYLAND UTILIZES EVIDENCE- BASED STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS DIET AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS AND REDUCE RISK FOR FOOD INSECURITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE IN FAMILIES. EFNEP FOCUSES ON DIET QUALITY, NUTRITION, BETTER FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, AND FOOD SAFETY. OUR WORKSHOPS ARE TAUGHT IN A SERIES AND PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE 6 LESSONS, OFTEN OVER SEVERAL WEEKS. THE CLASSES ARE TAUGHT IN SMALL GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALLY AND ARE DELIVERED IN A CULTURALLY SENSITIVE MANNER.  OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THE EFNEP PROGRAM IS TO PROMOTE NUTRITIONAL WELL-BEING OF LOW- NCOME FAMILIES. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A SERIES OF HANDS-ON, INTERACTIVE LESSONS WHEREIN PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS LEARN AND ARE ENCOURAGED TO IMPROVE FOOD AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS IN ACCORDANCE WITH USDA/U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS) DIETARYGUIDELINES, HHS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES, USDA\u2019S FOOD GUIDANCE SYSTEM (MYPLATE AND SIMILAR RESOURCES), AND PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO IMPROVING NUTRITIONAL HEALTH AND FOOD SECURITY. BY DOING SO, EFNEP CONTRIBUTES TO THE REDUCTION OF HEALTH DISPARITIES TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES. IT IS ALSO VITAL IN ADDRESSING MAJOR SOCIETAL CHALLENGES, SUCH AS REDUCING CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND HINDERING THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC DISEASE.  EFNEP FURTHER CONTRIBUTES TO THE HEALTH OF THE NATION BY WORKING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND INFORMING KEY DECISION MAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO SUPPORT AN IMPROVED FOOD AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS. IN WORKING WITH OTHERS, EFNEP\u2019S PRIMARY FOCUS REMAINS ON INCREASING PROGRAMMATIC REACH AND FACILITATING PARTICIPANTS\u2019 ABILITY TO MAKE DESIRED CHANGES AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS FAMILIES.  METHODS: EFNEP USES KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM SOCIAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE PROGRAM AND TO ADDRESS EMERGING ISSUES. CONTENT AND METHODOLOGY HELP BRIDGE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF NUTRITION EDUCATION WITH SCIENCE.  EFNEP FOCUSES ON FOOD-RELATED PRACTICES TO HELP PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ACHIEVE PERSONAL AND FAMILY WELLNESS. PARTICIPANTS LEARN TO: \u2022 CHOOSE AND EAT FOODS OF ADEQUATE VARIETY AND APPROPRIATE QUANTITY AND TO BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND REDUCE THE RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE (CORE AREA: DIET QUALITY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY); \u2022 IMPROVE FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SUCH AS PURCHASING, SELECTING, OR OTHERWISE OBTAINING; PREPARING; AND STORING FOODS TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINED AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY FOODS (CORE AREA: FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT) \u2022 PRACTICE SAFE FOOD HANDLING TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS (CORE AREA: FOOD SAFETY) \u2022 IDENTIFY AND USE EMERGENCY AND NON-EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE, AS NEEDED, TO ENSURE HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY (CORE AREA: FOOD SECURITY)  PEER EDUCATORS PROVIDE A SERIES OF LESSONS DIRECTLY OVER TIME IN GROUP OR ONE-ON-ONE SETTINGS. EMPHASIS IS ON PROVIDING SUFFICIENT CONTACT WITH PARTICIPANTS TO TEACH THEM IMPORTANT FOOD- RELATED SKILLS AND TO SHOW MEASURABLE IMPACTS ON THEIR BEHAVIORS. LESSONS ARE LEARNER-CENTERED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE NEEDS AND LEARNING STYLES OF PARTICIPANTS FORM THE BASIS OF PROGRAM CONTENT AND DELIVERY. DRAWING UPON THE STRENGTHS AND PAST EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPANTS LEADS TO A RICHER LEARNING EXPERIENCE. EFNEP USES INTERACTIVE HANDS-ON LEARNING APPROACHES, WHICH MAY BE REINFORCED BY TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATIVE TEACHING TECHNIQUES, AND ENGAGEMENT WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS.

OUR STATE IS RANKED 49TH IN THE COUNTRY IN OBESITY. HOWEVER, WE RANKED 50TH IN 2011. (2012 UNITED HEALTH FOUNDATION'S AMERICA'S HEALTH RANKINGS). SIXTY-FOUR PERCENT OF LOUISIANA ADULTS ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE (2009 CDC BRFSS) AND THE LOUISIANA REPORT CARD ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH, SPONSORED BY THE PENNINGTON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CENTER GRADED OUR STATE A \"D\". MOREOVER, THE 2012 UNITED HEALTH FOUNDATION REPORT, LOUISIANA RANKS 40TH IN THE PREVALENCE OF OBESE YOUTH. SINCE 1990, THE PREVALENCE OF OBESITY INCREASED BY 135% (2009 UNITED HEALTH FOUNDATION). RESEARCH SHOWS THAT OBESITY <(>&<)> OVERWEIGHT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK FOR COSTLY CHRONIC DISEASES, SUCH AS DIABETES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, OSTEOARTHRITIS, AND SOME CANCERS AND OBESE ADULTS HAVE A 36% HIGHER AVERAGE ANNUAL MEDICAL EXPENDITURE THAN ADULTS AT A NORMAL WEIGHT. FURTHERMORE, THE COST OF CHILD OBESITY-ASSOCIATED ILLNESS INCREASED FROM 35 TO 127 MILLION IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. OVERALL, THE POVERTY RATE IN LOUISIANA IS 19.7%, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF LOW- WAGE JOBS IS 33%, EXTREME POVERTY LEVELS ARE AT 12%. SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY\u2019S EFNEP PROGRAM TARGETS YOUTH AND THEIR PARENTS, SO THAT A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO EDUCATING THE FAMILY IS EMPLOYED. WE EMPHASIZE TEACHABLE MOMENTS THAT ALSO INVOLVE THE ENTIRE FAMILY IN MEAL PLANNING AND PREPARATION. TO ASSIST OUR EFNEP PROGRAM, THE SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CENTER HAS AN OUTREACH CENTER, THE SOUTHWEST CENTER FOR RURAL INITIATIVES, WHICH SERVES 10 PARISHES, INCLUSIVE OF THE PARISHES SERVED BY THE EFNEP PROGRAM. THE CENTER FOCUSES ON PROVIDING COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AND YOUTH PROGRAMMING TO THE CITIZENS WITHIN THE 10-PARISH OUTREACH. THE CENTER ASSISTS OUR EFNEP PROGRAM BY REFERRING FAMILIES AND YOUTH TO OUR PROGRAM, PROVIDING A SITE FOR CLASSES AND ACTIVITIES, AND PROVIDING WORKSPACE, INTERNET, AND COPY SERVICES TO OUR NUTRITION EDUCATORS WHEN NEEDED.   PROGRAM APPROACH TODAY'S CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS FREQUENTLY DECIDE WHAT TO EAT WITH LITTLE ADULT SUPERVISION. THE INCREASE IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CONVENIENT FOODS AND FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS HAS MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO TEACH YOUTH ABOUT HEALTHY LIFESTYLES. EFNEP\u2019S PRIMARY TARGET AUDIENCES ARE LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN AND YOUTH. ADDITIONALLY, EFNEP PARTICIPANTS MAY ALSO BE RECIPIENTS OF SNAP BENEFITS OR OTHER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT FOOD ASSISTANCE, INCLUDING WOMEN INFANTS, AND CHILDREN (WIC) PROGRAM RECIPIENTS. THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR OUR PROGRAMMING WILL BE YOUTH FROM LIMITED- RESOURCE FAMILIES AND THEIR PARENTS. THE YOUTH WILL TAKE PART IN THE FAMILY \u201cCOOKING SCHOOL\u201d. THIS  PROGRAM TEACHES FAMILIES HOW TO INCLUDE YOUTH IN HEALTHY MEALTIME SELECTIONS AND PREPARATION, THEREBY MAKING MEALTIME A TEACHABLE MOMENT. ADDITIONAL CLASSES WILL BE TAUGHT ON DIETARY QUALITY, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND FOOD SAFETY. BASED ON PARISH FOCUS MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH PARISH STAFF, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE REMAINS A NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE NUTRITION AND FITNESS EDUCATION PROGRAM IN AVOYELLES, EVANGELINE, ST. LANDRY, AND LAFAYETTE PARISHES. THE SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY AG CENTER\u2019S EFNEP PROGRAM WILL BE DELIVERED IN AFTER-SCHOOL CARE PROGRAMS, HEAD START (PARENTS), COMMUNITY CENTERS, AND NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS INCLUDING FAITH-BASED ENTITIES. PARAPROFESSIONALS WILL EXECUTE THE PROGRAM IN DESIGNATED PARISHES. METHODS OF PROGRAM DELIVERY WILL INCLUDE TEACHING GROUPS, IN-HOME NUTRITION NOTES TO PARENTS, AND INTERACTIVE HANDS-ON GROUP SESSIONS (I.E., COOKING SCHOOL). NUTRITION SPECIALISTS AND PARISH STAFF WILL PROVIDE TRAINING FOR VOLUNTEERS TO ASSIST WITH TEACHING THE PARTICIPANTS.   GEOGRAPHIC AREA COVERED 1. AVOYELLES PARISH, LOUISIANA 2. LAFAYETTE PARISH, LOUISIANA  PROGRAM PRIORITIES 1. INCREASING FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT OUTCOMES FOR ADULTS AND FAMILIES IN LOUISIANA, 21 PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN ARE FOOD INSECURE, AND 15 PERCENT ARE FOOD INSUFFICIENT. OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF IMPROVEMENTS BY 2% EACH YEAR FOR THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO PLAN MEALS IN ADVANCE, COMPARE PRICES, DO NOT RUN OUT OF FOOD, AND USE GROCERY LISTS. IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MEASURED USING WEBNEERS ADULT QUESTIONNAIRE CHECKLIST SUMMARY BY MEASURING ONE OR MORE IMPROVEMENTS IN FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE OUR OBJECTIVES ARE CLOSELY RELATED WHEN IT COMES TO MANAGING FOOD RESOURCES AND DECREASING FOOD INSECURITY, WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR NUTRITION EDUCATION ASSISTANTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE TEACHING THE MOST UP-TO-DATE STRATEGIES. WE WILL DO THIS THROUGH STAFF TRAINING AND WORKSHOPS AND BY COLLABORATING WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS THAT SHARE OUR COMMITMENT. SPECIFIC STRATEGIES WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT ARE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH AS FOOD BANKS AND EMERGENCY FOOD SHELTERS FOR ADDITIONAL REFERRALS FOR ADULT CLIENTELE AND CONTINUING TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO STAFF ON EFFECTIVE TEACHING METHODOLOGIES FOR ADULTS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE INCORPORATED VIA SOCIAL MEDIA RESOURCES IN LESSONS, USE OF VIDEOS, RECRUITMENT VIA SOCIAL MEDIA, EMAIL AND TEXT MESSAGE REMINDERS FOR LESSONS AND THE USE OF EXISTING APPS WHERE APPROPRIATE. THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY WILL SERVE TO BOLSTER RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES, REINFORCE LESSONS BEING TAUGHT DURING TIMES OF SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL LESSONS. PSE WORK WILL BE DONE VIA COMMUNITY COLLABORATIONS/PARTNERSHIPS WITH FOOD BANKS AND OTHER EMERGENCY FOOD SHELTERS.  2. IMPROVING DIET QUALITY IN ADULTS AND FAMILIES  WE SELECTED DIET QUALITY BECAUSE, IN LOUISIANA, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT HAVE REACHED THE POINT OF BEING EPIDEMIC. LOUISIANA IS RANKED AS THE 4TH HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY IN RELATION TO OBESITY. OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE NUTRITION PRACTICES WHICH EFNEP PARTICIPANTS ADOPT BY AT LEAST 2% FOR EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MEASURED USING WEBNEERS ADULT QUESTIONNAIRE CHECKLIST SUMMARY REPORT BY ASSESSING ONE OR MORE DIET QUALITY BEHAVIORS. SPECIFIC STRATEGIES WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT ARE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL AGENCIES FOR ADDITIONAL REFERRALS OF ADULT CLIENTELE AND CONTINUING TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO STAFF ON EFFECTIVE TEACHING METHODOLOGIES FOR ADULTS. OUR TECHNOLOGY PLAN WILL INCLUDE USING SOCIAL MEDIA RESOURCES IN LESSONS, USE OF VIDEOS, RECRUITMENT VIA SOCIAL MEDIA, EMAIL AND TEXT MESSAGE REMINDERS FOR LESSONS, AND THE USE OF EXISTING APPS WHERE APPROPRIATE. THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY WILL SERVE TO BOLSTER RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES, REINFORCE LESSONS BEING TAUGHT DURING TIMES OF SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL LESSONS. SUCCESS WILL BE DETERMINED VIA THE NUMBER OF NEW RECRUITS AND RETENTION RATES. 3. INCREASING FOOD SAFETY OUTCOMES FOR ADULTS AND FAMILIES IT IS ESTIMATED THAT SOME 620,280 PERSONS GET INFECTED BY SALMONELLA IN LOUISIANA EVERY YEAR. FOOD CONTAMINATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY POINT ALONG THE FOOD PRODUCTION CHAIN. WITH THAT SAID, WE WILL FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON HAVING OUR CLIENTELE IMPROVE IN DAILY FOOD SAFETY PRACTICES. OUR OVERALL GOAL IS TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF IMPROVEMENT BY 2% FOR EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IMPROVEMENT WILL BE MEASURED USING THE WEBNEERS ADULT QUESTIONNAIRE CHECKLIST SUMMARY REPORT BY ASSESSING TWO OR MORE FOOD SAFETY BEHAVIORS. SPECIFIC STRATEGIES WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT OUR TRAINING AND CERTIFYING OUR STAFF IN FOOD SAFETY AND CONTINUING TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO STAFF ON EFFECTIVE TEACHING METHODOLOGIES FOR ADULTS. 4. IMPROVING DIET QUALITY IN YOUTH WE SELECTED DIET QUALITY BECAUSE, IN LOUISIANA, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT HAVE REACHED THE POINT OF BEING EPIDEMIC. LOUISIANA IS RANKED THE 4TH HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY IN RELATION TO OBESITY AT 38.1%. MOREOVER, HEART.ORG REPORTS THAT CHILDHOOD OBESITY IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE HEALTH CONCERN AMONG PARENTS IN THE U.S., TOPPING DRUG ABUSE AND SMOKING. OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE NUTRITION PRACTICES WHICH EFNEP YOUTH PARTICIPANTS ADOPT BY AT LEAST 2% FOR EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MEASURED USING THE WEBNEERS YOUTH QUESTIONNAIRE CHECKLIST SUMMARY REPORT BY ASSESSING ONE OR MORE DIET QUALITY BEHAVIORS. SPECIFIC STRATEGIES WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT ARE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL AGENCIES FOR ADDITIONAL REFERRALS OF ADULT CLIENTELE AND CONTINUING TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO STAFF ON EFFECTIVE TEACHING METHODOLOGIES FOR YOUTH.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OVERVIEW K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION (KSRE) IS A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF EDUCATORS SHARING UNBIASED, RESEARCH- BASED INFORMATION AND EXPERTISE ON ISSUES IMPORTANT TO KANSANS. THE KSRE NETWORK INCLUDESOFFICES IN ALL 105 COUNTIES, ALONG WITH FOUR REGIONAL EXTENSION OFFICES, FIVE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENCOMPASS VARIABILITY IN CLIMATE AND SOILS, FOUR SATELLITE UNITS, FOUR AGRONOMY EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND FOUR HORTICULTURE CENTERS AND EXPERIMENT FIELDS. IN ADDITION, KSRE FUNDS RESEARCH PROJECTS IN 20 DEPARTMENTS ACROSS FIVE COLLEGES.  A UNIQUE FEATURE WITHIN THE K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION ORGANIZATION IS THE CLOSE ALIGNMENT OF RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. IN 1996, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION WAS FORMED BY ALIGNING THE KANSAS AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (KAES) AND THE KANSAS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE. THE STRATEGIC INTENT OF THIS ALIGNMENT WAS TO ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCY AND SYNERGY BETWEEN DISCOVERY AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. ONE ANCILLARY BENEFIT OF THIS ALIGNMENT IS THAT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO RAPID EXTENSION PROGRAMMING AND APPLICATION IN THE FIELD. THIS ALIGNMENT ALSO ALLOWS MORE FLUID COMPLIANCE WITH MULTI-STATE ANDINTEGRATED COMPONENTS OF AREERA.  K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSING ITS EFFORTS ON FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES (CRITICAL ISSUES) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT ALL KANSANS: GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES, HEALTH, DEVELOPING TOMORROW'S LEADERS, AND COMMUNITY VITALITY. THESE GRAND CHALLENGES WERE DETERMINED THROUGH A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND DEFINE AREAS OF EMPHASIS FOR AGENTS, SPECIALISTS, AND RESEARCHERS.  EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS AT THE LOCAL, REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL WORK TO DEVELOP REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE SIGNATURE PROGRAMS ALONG WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS MEMBERS THROUGH 11 PROGRAM FOCUS TEAMS \u2013 ADULT DEVELOPMENT AND AGING; COMMUNITY VITALITY; CROP PRODUCTION; FAMILY AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT; FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; FARM MANAGEMENT; HORTICULTURE; LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; NATURAL RESOURCES; NUTRITION, FOOD SAFETY AND HEALTH; AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, TWO TRANSDISCIPLINARY TEAMS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS COMPLEX ISSUES TO KANSANS - LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS AND STRESS AND RESILIENCY. THE WORK OF THESE TEAMS FALLS WITHIN THE OVERALL UMBRELLA OF THE FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES.  K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CANNOT SOLVE THESE CHALLENGES ALONE. KSRE'S STATEWIDE PRESENCE LENDS ITSELF TO COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH ORGANIZATIONS, PRIVATE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY, LOCAL GROUPS, STATE AND FEDERAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES. QUALITY FACULTY DRAW BUSINESSES AND FUNDING TO K- STATE AND TO KANSAS INCLUDING: - K-STATE IS THE ONLY UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD WITH ACCESS TO A FULL CONTINUUM OF BIOSECURITY LABORATORIES LOCATED ON OR ADJACENT TO CAMPUS. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE WILL PROVIDE PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSTICS, RESEARCH, SURVEILLANCE, AND TRAINING IN DISEASE VECTOR BIOLOGY. THE LABORATORIES WILL OFFER EMERGENCY RAPID TESTING AND MANUFACTURING TO PROTECT THE NATION'S ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SUPPLY DURING A CRISIS. - KANSAS PRIDE IS DEDICATED TO SERVING COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO ENCOURAGE AND ASSISTLOCAL GOVERNMENT AND VOLUNTEERS IN MAKING THEIR COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK. THE KANSAS PRIDE PROGRAM IS A PARTNERSHIP OF K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION, THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, KANSAS MASONS AND KANSAS PRIDE, INC. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, LOCAL COMMUNITIES IDENTIFY WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO PRESERVE, CREATE, OR IMPROVE FOR THEIR FUTURE. THEN, WORKING WITH THE RESOURCES OF K-STATE RESEARCH <(>&<)> EXTENSION AND THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS PULL TOGETHER TO CREATE THEIR IDEAL COMMUNITY FUTURE. - EXTENSION\u2019S RESEARCH CENTERS, EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND HIGHLY SKILLED SCIENTISTS AND STAFF, COMBINED WITH THE CLIMATE AND SOIL VARIABILITY ACROSS THE STATE, PROVIDE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH  AND CORPORATE AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. - FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES IS A PARTNER OF THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT FOR AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE EDUCATION TO MEDICARE ELIGIBLE KANSANS. APPROXIMATELY 1/3 OF THE CONTACTS OF THOSE SERVED ARE VULNERABLE BENEFICIARIES WITH INCOMES BELOW 150% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL. - KANSAS 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WAS AWARDED A CONTRACT BY THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR $4.2 MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE SUMMERS TO PROVIDE HANDS-ON, PROJECT-BASED 4-H SUMMER PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS COVID-19 -RELATED LEARNING LOSS IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUILDING UPON THE LONG RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LEVERAGING THE STATE'S LARGEST YOUTH DEVELOPMENT NETWORK REACHING ALL 105 COUNTIES, KANSAS 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WILL USE SUMMER ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF YOUTH AS A PART OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN \u2014 ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF PLAN. - K-STATE - IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FOUR OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND SEVERAL INDUSTRY PARTNERS HAVE JOINED EFFORTS TO CREATE THE IRRIGATION I NNOVATION CONSORTIUM, A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH EFFORT TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENTAND ADOPTION OF EFFICIENT IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES. - K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION WILL ADDRESS THE HEALTH OF KANSANS THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL COOPERATIVE EXTENSION\u2019S FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH EQUITY AND WELL-BEING WHICH INCLUDES A FOCUS ON HEALTH EQUITY, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND COALITIONS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSETS.  THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF KANSAS CONTINUE TO CHANGE. KSRE IS REACHING OUT TO BOTH UNDERSERVED AND TRADITIONAL AUDIENCES THROUGH NEW VENUES.

THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO BRING SYSTEMIC CHANGE AND DIVERSITY TO THE KSRE TEAM AND PROVIDE CULTURAL COMPETENCY AWARENESS AND SKILLS THAT THEY CAN PRACTICALLY APPLY IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY WORK. OTHER EFFORTS INCLUDE: - THE MULTICULTURAL UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM TARGETS UNDER- REPRESENTED POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS WITH THE GOAL TO ESTABLISH NETWORKING RELATIONSHIPS BACK TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOME INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS K-STATE FACULTY. THIS PROGRAM HAS A SPECIFIC GOAL OF GROWING THE MINORITY POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS WITHIN GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND ACROSS OTHER PARTNER COLLEGES REPRESENTED WITHIN K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. - LOCAL UNIT EXTENSION COUNCIL MEMBERS REVIEW PARITY STATISTICS ANNUALLY AND SPEND TIME DETERMINING STRATEGIC EFFORTS NECESSARY TO REACH UNDERSERVED AND AT-RISK AUDIENCES. - K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN AND SECURING SERVICES THROUGH LANGUAGE LINE SERVICES TO BRING GREATER ACCESS TO LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT AUDIENCES. - THIS FALL, A NEW COMMUNITY LIAISON WILL BE ON STAFF TO HELP LINK KSRE\u2019S RESOURCES TO THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN NORTHEAST KANSAS.  GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS AS THE STATE'S LARGEST EMPLOYER,AGRICULTURE DRIVES THE KANSAS ECONOMY. IN 2020, THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTED $70.3 BILLION TO THE KANSAS ECONOMY. AGRICULTURE IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE, WITH 250,058 PEOPLE ACCOUNTING FOR 13 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE. WE ARE IMPROVING FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS TO FEED THE WORLD'S GROWING POPULATION, WHICH WILL ECONOMICALLY BENEFIT KANSAS.  TO FEED AND SUSTAIN A GROWING POPULATION, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRACTICES TO HELP FARMERS, RANCHERS, AND AGRIBUSINESSES IMPROVE PROFITABILITY, EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY FOR KANSAS, OUR NATION, AND THE WORLD THROUGH CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH IN AREAS SUCH AS GENETICS, DISEASE PREVENTION, FOOD SECURITY AND FARM BILL EDUCATION.  PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS WOULD INCLUDE:  \u2022 DEVELOPING AND TESTING NEW CROP, VEGETABLE, AND TREE VARIETIES SUITED TO THE KANSAS CLIMATE. \u2022 IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF FEED AND WATER USE, REPRODUCTION AND ANIMAL HEALTH. \u2022 REDUCING FOOD WASTE CAUSED BY INSECTS, POOR STORAGE, AND PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. \u2022 CREATING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS THAT INTENSIFY PRODUCTIVITY. \u2022 IDENTIFYING WAYS TO MAINTAIN CATTLE RANGELAND THREATENED BY VARIATIONS IN CLIMATE. \u2022 LEADING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TEAMS TO SOLVE GLOBAL FOOD ISSUES. \u2022 HELPING FAMILIES STRETCH THEIR FOOD DOLLARS.  WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES WATER QUALITY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN KANSAS AND WATER QUANTITY IN WESTERN KANSAS ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES. CURRENT IRRIGATION TRENDS COULD DEPLETE 69 PERCENT OF THE GROUNDWATER IN THE OGALLALA AQUIFER WITHIN 50 YEARS, DRASTICALLY AFFECTING THE KANSAS ECONOMY. SEDIMENT AND SILT ARE WASHING INTO LARGE RESERVOIRS THAT SUPPLY DRINKING WATER AND RECREATION TO MANY KANSANS.  TO ENSURE FUTURE GENERATIONS HAVE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF CLEAN WATER, OUR FOCUS WILL BE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO HELP KANSANS MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY. THESE INCLUDE PIONEERING NEW PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES; RESEARCHING HIGH-PRIORITY WATER ISSUES; FACILITATING MEETINGS AMONG LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATING RESEARCH RESULTS.  PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS WOULD INCLUDE: \u2022 BREEDING NEW DROUGHT-TOLERANT CROP VARIETIES THAT CAN BE USED FOR HUMAN AND PET FOOD, LIVESTOCK FEED, AND FUEL. \u2022 IDENTIFYING BEST-ADAPTED TURF SPECIES AND CULTIVARS FOR KANSAS. \u2022 DEVELOPING MORE EFFICIENT IRRIGATION AND WATER MONITORING SYSTEMS FOR HOME AND FARM USE. \u2022 REDUCING RUNOFF AND SEDIMENTATION INTO RESERVOIRS. \u2022 IMPROVING LIVESTOCK GENETICS TO INCREASE FEEDING EFFICIENCY, WHICH REDUCES FEED AND WATER NEEDS. \u2022 WORKING WITH THE STATE OF KANSAS AND PARTNERING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES IDENTIFIED IN THE 50- YEAR VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF WATER PLAN. \u2022 BALANCING THE USE AND PROTECTION OF THE STATE\u2019S NATURAL AND RECREATIONAL RESOURCES THAT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL, MEDICAL, E CONOMIC AND CULTURAL BENEFITS.

TO SERVE THE MOST FAMILIES AND YOUTH POSSIBLE, IOWA EFNEP FOCUSES PROGRAMMING IN AREAS WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF ELIGIBLE FAMILIES. THIS INCLUDES THE URBAN COUNTIES OF BLACK HAWK, LINN, POLK, SCOTT, AND WOODBURY. PROGRAMMING FOR YOUTH IS PROVIDED IN POLK, BLACK HAWK AND CERRO GORDO COUNTIES. NUTRITION EDUCATION AND HEALTHY FOOD ACCESS PROGRAMMING ARE PROVIDED TO ADDITIONAL ELIGIBLE FAMILIES IN IOWA THROUGH THE SNAP-ED PROGRAM.  AUDIENCE AND OUTREACH  IOWANS EXPERIENCING POVERTY OFTEN EAT FEWER FRUITS, VEGETABLES, AND LOW-FAT DAIRY THAN IS RECOMMENDED. IN ADDITION, MANY COULD IMPROVE HEALTH THROUGH INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. FAMILIES WHO ARE FOOD INSECURE FACE MORE BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING THESE GOALS. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (BRFSS) DATA FROM 2017 INDICATE THAT 44% OF IOWANS IN THE LOWEST INCOME CATEGORY EAT LESS THAN ONE FRUIT PER DAY AND 27% EAT LESS THAN ONE VEGETABLE PER DAY. IOWANS IN HIGHER INCOME CATEGORIES REPORTED GREATER FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION. THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS RECOMMEND 150 MINUTES PER WEEK OF MODERATE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OR 75 MINUTES PER WEEK OF VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. BRFSS DATA FROM 2017 SHOWS THAT JUST 12% OF IOWANS WHO EARN LESS THAN $15,000 PER YEAR MEET THIS RECOMMENDATION. OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY ARE SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS IN IOWA. ACCORDING TO 2018 BRFSS DATA, 69% OF IOWANS ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE AND 63% OF IOWANS EARNING LESS THAN $15,000 PER YEAR ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE.  ACS 2018 DATA ESTIMATE THAT 8.8% OF IOWANS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME, AND FOR HALF OF THOSE SPANISH WAS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE. IOWA EFNEP AIMS TO PROVIDE A BILINGUAL EDUCATOR WHO SPEAKS SPANISH IN COUNTIES WITH SIGNIFICANT DEMAND FOR THAT SERVICE. A RECENT IOWA SNAP-ED NEEDS ASSESSMENT SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS AFRICAN AMERICAN HAVE THE HIGHEST NEED FOR NUTRITION RELATED INTERVENTIONS. THEREFORE, EFNEP AND OTHER NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN IOWA ARE COMMITTED TO IDENTIFYING METHODS OF INCREASING SERVICE TO THIS AUDIENCE.  WITH THE PANDEMIC, SOCIAL DISTANCING HAS BECOME THE NEW NORMAL IN THE STATE OF IOWA. EFNEP NUTRITION EDUCATORS PROVED QUICK AND ADAPTABLE IN THIS SITUATION. ALL ADULT STAFF ARE TEACHING VIRTUAL EFNEP LESSONS INCLUDING KEY NUTRITION INFORMATION, ENGAGING DISCUSSIONS, AND SKILL BUILDING IN THE AREAS OF RECIPE PREPARATION AND MEAL PLANNING. THUS, IOWA EFNEP AIMS TO IMPROVE AND CONTINUE VIRTUAL EDUCATION IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF IOWANS. IOWA EFNEP IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY NUTRITION EDUCATION WHILE CONTINUING TO GROW AND ADAPT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF IOWA.  THE ADULT PRIORITY AUDIENCE IS CAREGIVERS WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE A HOUSEHOLD INCOME LESS THAN 185% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. OTHER PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE ELEMENTARY AGE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS WITH ANTICIPATED CAREGIVING/PARENTING NEEDS. STAFF USE A WIDE VARIETY OF RECRUITMENT TECHNIQUES INCLUDING REFERRALS FROM ENROLLED FAMILIES AND AGENCIES, PRE-FORMED GROUPS,  DEMONSTRATIONS, AND THE LIST OF FAMILIES PARTICIPATING IN SNAP. REFERRALS ARE A COMMON AND EFFECTIVE METHOD OF RECRUITING NEW PARTIC IPANTS. REFERRALS MAY BE MADE FROM OTHER EXTENSION PROGRAMS OR BY OTHER AGENCIES SERVING A SIMILAR AUDIENCE. CURRENT AND GRADUATED EFNEP PARTICIPANTS PROVIDE THE BEST REFERRALS, SO EDUCATORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO REGULARLY ASK PARTICIPANTS TO REFER FRIENDS AND FAMILY. PRE-FORMED GROUPS ARE THOSE THAT ALREADY MEET FOR A PURPOSE OTHER THAN EFNEP BUT SERVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF EFNEP-ELIGIBLE CLIENTS. THESE GROUPS MAY INCLUDE HEAD START, PARENT PREPARATION CLASSES, COMMUNITY OR NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS, TEENAGE PARENT PROGRAMS, AND OTHERS. DEMONSTRATIONS BASED ON THE EFNEP CURRICULUM CAN CAPTURE THE ATTENTION OF POTENTIAL AUDIENCES. POTENTIAL SITES FOR DEMONSTRATIONS INCLUDE WIC, HEAD START, MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH CLINICS, COMMUNITY OR NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS, COMMODITY FOOD SITES, SCHOOL EVENTS AND FOOD PANTRIES. IOWA'S YOUTH EFNEP PROGRAM HAS STRONG DEMAND IN COMMUNITIES WHERE IT OPERATES. IT HINGES ON PARTNER SUPPORT AS IT IS DELIVERED AT LOCATIONS PROVIDING AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER CARE TO YOUTH FROM LOW-INCOME FAMILIES. MOST PARTNER AGENCIES ARE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY CENTERS (I.E., YMCA, SALVATION ARMY).  PROGRAM ACTIVITIES  EFNEP PROGRAMMING FOR ADULTS USES THE EATING SMART - BEING ACTIVE CURRICULUM FROM COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY. THE SERIES IS DELIVERED BY EDUCATORS WHO ARE TYPICALLY PARAPROFESSIONALS HIRED FROM THE COMMUNITIES WHICH THEY AIM TO SERVE. THE SERIES INCLUDES EIGHT LESSONS WHICH FOCUS ON NUTRITION PRACTICES, FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, FOOD SAFETY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. EATING SMART - BEING ACTIVE LESSON PLANS ARE DETAILED AND APPROPRIATE FOR USE BY PARAPROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS. EACH LESSON IS DESIGNED TO BE TAUGHT IN 60 TO 90 MINUTES. THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IS BASED ON THE LATEST RESEARCH IN HEALTH AND NUT RITION FROM THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS 2020 AND MYPLATE (WILL BE UPDATED WITH NEW GUIDELINES). EACH LESSON ALSO INCLUDES A REFERENCE SECTION CALLED \u201cFOR YOUR INFORMATION\u201d TO ASSIST WITH STAFF BACKGROUND UNDERSTANDING AND TRAINING. ALL PARTICIPANT MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. ACTIVITIES INCLUDE FACILITATED DISCUSSION (DIALOGUE-BASED LEARNING) AND HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES SUCH AS MENU PLANNING, WHILE INFORMATION SHARING SECTIONS ARE SHORT. THE CORE LESSONS INCLUDE THE LATEST, RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION FROM THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS AND COVER TOPICS ABOUT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, NUTRITION AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES, FOOD PREPARATION (COOKING), AND FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (SAVING MONEY AT THE GROCERY STORE), EATING A VARIETY OF HEALTHY FOODS FROM ALL OF THE FOOD GROUPS, FOOD SAFETY, REDUCING FAT, SUGAR AND SALT, AND FEEDING CHILDREN. SEVERAL EVALUATION STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EATING SMART - BEING ACTIVE. SPECIFICALLY, CURRICULUM DEVELOPERS UTILIZED EXPERTS IN ADULT EDUCATION, NUTRITION AND THE EXPANDED FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM (EFNEP) AND SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EDUCATION (SNAP-ED) FROM MULTIPLE STATES TO REVIEW THE CURRICULUM DURING ITS DEVELOPMENT. REVIEWERS ASSESSED THE CURRICULUM AND CONFIRMED IT ADHERED TO AND EFFECTIVELY APPLIED THE TENETS AND PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY AND ADULT LEARNING AND THE CONTENT WAS BASED ON THE 2005 DIETARY GUIDELINES (EATING SMART \u2022 BEING ACTIVE HAS NOW BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT THE 2015 DIETARY GUIDELINES WITH UPDATES FOR 2020 GUIDELINES COMING SOON). IOWA EFNEP HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN STRONG BEHAVIOR CHANGE, OFTEN EXCEEDING TIER AND NATIONAL AVERAGES USING EATING SMART - BEING ACTIVE.  KIDS IN THE KITCHEN WAS CREATED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AND IS ALIGNED WITH CURRENT DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS. EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS IS CURRENTLY PRACTICE BASED. MISSOURI IS  PRIORITIZING ADDITIONAL EVALUATION TO EARN THE EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGNATION. SEVEN LESSONS ADDRESS THE VALUE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, FOOD SAFETY, MYPLATE AND EACH FOOD GROUP WITH CHILD FRIENDLY ACTIVITIES AND COOKING OPPORTUNITIES. LESSONS ADDRESS THE EFNEP CORE AREAS OF DIET QUALITY, FOOD SAFETY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY USING LANGUAGE AND HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES THAT ARE RELEVANT FOR THE AGE GROUP. KIDS IN THE KITCHEN HAS DEMONSTRATED EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS WHEN EVALUATED USING THE YOUTH EFNEP EVALUATION TOOLS. GIVEN THE AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS, KNOWLEDGE IS MEASURED WITH THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN AND SOME BEHAVIORAL CHOICES WITH THE OLDER CHILDREN. IOWA HAS ADAPTED THE CURRICULUM TO REFLECT RECIPES FROM OUR OWN STATE'S COLLECTION AND THE ADDITION OF PARENT MATERIALS THAT CONNECT FAMILIES TO IOWA'S SPEND SMART. EAT SMART. ONLINE PRESENCE. WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PARENT COMPONENT TO COMPLEMENT THE LESSONS FOR CHILDREN IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO LEARN TOGETHER, PRACTICE NEW SKILLS AND ADOPT NEW HABITS.  KIDS IN THE KITCHEN ADDRESSES DIET QUALITY, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FOOD SAFETY IN A CHILD-FRIENDLY WAY FOR CHILDREN IN GRADES K-5. GIVEN THE YOUNG AGE OF CHILDREN SERVED WITH THIS CURRICULUM, IT DOES NOT ADDRESS FOOD SECURITY OR FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. YOUTH EDUCATORS TEACH IN A WAY THAT IS INFORMED BY THE REALITY THAT MANY OF THE CHILDREN PARTICIPATING COME FROM HOMES WHERE FOOD SECURITY IS A REAL CHALLENGE. THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THIS BY USING INCLUSIVE TERMS WHEN TALKING ABOUT FOOD BEHAVIORS; SUCH AS, MENTIONING THE FOOD PANTRY AS WELL AS THE GROCERY STORE WHEN DISCUSSING SHOPPING FOR FOOD.  DELIVERABLES AND OUTCOMES  GOALS FOR 2023 INCLUDE:  \u2022 66% OF ADULT EFNEP PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETE AT LEAST 6 LESSONS WILL INCREASE THEIR FREQUENCY OF DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TOTALING 30 MINUTES OR MORE PER DAY. \u2022 ADULT EFNEP PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETE AT LEAST 6 LESSONS WILL INCREASE THEIR INTAKE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY A COMBINED 0.8 CUPS. \u2022 54% OF ADULT EFNEP PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETE AT LEAST 6 LESSONS WILL INCREASE THEIR FREQUENCY OF PLANNING MEALS BEFORE SHOPPING. \u2022 36% OF 3-5 GRADE YOUTH EFNEP PARTICIPANTS WILL INCREASE THEIR FREQUENCY OF VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION AFTER 5 OR MORE LESSONS. \u2022 41% OF 3-5 GRADE YOUTH EFNEP PARTICIPANTS WILL INCREASE THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FREQUENCY AFTER 5 OR MORE LESSONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7148b6ec-c422-d557-aa04-0c8488cc6775-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23EFNEPXXXG014_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735981, "Award ID": "NI23EFNEPXXXG013", "Award Amount": 1624777.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-16", "CFDA Number": "10.514", "Description": "THE GOAL OF MISSOURI\u2019S EXPANDED FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM (EFNEP) IS TO ASSIST MISSOURIANS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES IN ACHIEVING LIFELONG HEALTH AND FITNESS.

KENTUCKY CONSISTENTLY RANKS AMONG THE TOP TEN STATES IN THE UNITED STATES FOR POVERTY WHEN UTILIZING THE POVERTY RATE BY HOUSEHOLD INCOME, WITH THE MOST CURRENT STATISTICS REPORTING 18.3%1 (823,443 OF 4,499,690) OF KENTUCKIANS LIVING IN POVERTY. THE GREATEST PERCENTAGES OF KENTUCKYS POPULATION LIVING IN POVERTY ARE LOCATED IN THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST AREAS OF THE STATE, BUT 49% (59) OF KENTUCKY COUNTIES HAVE POVERTY LEVELS HIGHER THAN 18.3%. WHILE PERCENTAGES OF POVERTY ARE LOWER IN URBAN AREAS, THE NUMBERS OF KENTUCKIANS LIVING IN POVERTY ARE GREATER IN THESE AREAS.  THE FOOD RESEARCH AND ACTION CENTER REPORTS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN POVERTY AND OBESITY2, AND KENTUCKY DEMONSTRATES THIS CORRELATION. KENTUCKYS SELFREPORTED PREVALENCE OF OBESITY AMONG ADULTS IS 36.6%3 (1,113,120 OF 3,041,313), AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 2018, 13.1%4 (ABOUT 398,412) OF KENTUCKYS ADULT POPULATION WAS KNOWN TO BE DIABETIC. ACCORDING TO THE 2020 KIDS COUNT DATA CENTER, 23% OF KENTUCKYS CHILDREN (ABOUT 269,602) LIVED AT 100% POVERTY, AND 40% (ABOUT 468,874) LIVED IN AREAS OF CONCENTRATED POVERTY, 2013 20178.

TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ELIGIBLE HISPANIC FAMILIES, KY EFNEP HAS DEVELOPED EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS, PUBLICATIONS, AND TEACHING AIDS WRITTEN IN SPANISH AND USES TRANSLATORS WHEN NEEDED. TO REACH REFUGEE POPULATIONS, THERE ARE PUBLICATIONS AVAILABLE IN FRENCH AND SWAHILI. IN ADDITION TO LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AUDIENCES WHO DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE, EFNEP IN KENTUCKY DESIGNS RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF KENTUCKIANS WHO HAVE LOW LITERACY LEVELS. EFNEP REACHES OUT TO AUDIENCES WHO ARE VISUALLY IMPAIRED USING CURRICULUM TRANSLATED INTO BRAILLE AND MODIFICATIONS TO CURRICULUM TO MEET PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. EFNEP WILL ALSO TARGET THE LARGE NUMBER OF MILITARY FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WHO RESIDE IN KENTUCKY AND ARE MEMBERS OF THE LIMITED RESOURCE COMMUNITY. TO REACH SPECIFIC ADULT POPULATIONS, THE ADULT CURRICULUM IS CURRENTLY BEING MODIFIED TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF AUDIENCES IN SUBSTANCE USE RECOVERY; AS WELL, AN ADDITIONAL MODIFICATION FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. LIMITED RESOURCE YOUTH ARE REACHED THROUGH VARIOUS VENUES, INCLUDING SCHOOL PROGRAMS, SUMMER YOUTH CAMPS, FAMILY RESOURCE YOUTH SERVICE CENTERS AND LOCATIONS OFFERING THE SUMMER FEEDING PROGRAM. UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF COUNTY FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCE AGENTS AND AREA NUTRITION AGENTS, AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF STATE AND COUNTY EXTENSION RESOURCES, PARAPROFESSIONALS BUILD A NETWORK WITH PARTNER AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE REFERRALS, PROGRAM VOLUNTEERS, AND MEETING LOCATIONS.

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

FOR YOUTH PROGRAMMING, ARKANSAS EFNEP USES THE KIDS IN THE KITCHEN (KIK) CURRICULUM DEVELOPED BY MISSOURI COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND BASED ON USDA'S MYPLATE, AND TEEN CUISINE, A CURRICULUM DEVELOPED BY VIRGINIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. THE KIK CURRICULUM IS A SERIES OF SIX LESSONS IN THREE AGE LEVELS. LEVEL A (AGES 6-9); LEVEL B (AGES 10-12); AND LEVEL C (AGES 13-15). FOR THE YOUTH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COMPONENT, ARKANSAS EFNEP USES THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COMPONENT OF KIK. TEEN CUISINE IS AVAILABLE FOR USE WITH YOUTH IN GRADES 6-12. THIS CURRICULUM WAS ADOPTED BASED ON REQUESTS FROM EFNEP EDUCATORS AND SCHOOL PARTNERS WHO ASKED FOR ANOTHER OPTION TO USE WITH THIS AGE/GRADE RANGE. TEEN CUISINE CONSISTS OF 6 LESSONS WITH EACH LESSON OFFERING A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES COVERING NUTRITION, FOOD SAFETY, FOOD PREPARATION, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE GOALS OF THE CURRICULUM ARE TO APPLY MYPLATE GUIDANCE, LEARN HOW TO IDENTIFY NUTRIENT DENSE FOODS AND BEVERAGES, READAND FOLLOW A RECIPE, PREPARE FOOD SAFELY, USE FOOD LABELS TO CHOOSE HEALTHIER FOODS AND SNACKS, AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND INCLUDE IT IN EVERYDAY LIFE.

ALASKA HAS A TOTAL POPULATION OF 735,554 ACCORDING TO THE 2019 ESTIMATES BY THE CENSUS BUREAU, A 3.7% INCREASE SINCE 2010. MORE THAN HALF OF THE STATE\u2019S POPULATION (53%) RESIDE IN THE SOUTH-CENTRAL REGION THAT IS COMPRISED OF THE ANCHORAGE AND MATANUSKA SUSITNA (MAT-SU) BOROUGH. FOURTEEN PERCENT OF THE POPULATION RESIDES IN THE FAIRBANKS AREA, 8% IN THE KENAI PENINSULA, 4% IN JUNEAU. THE REMAINDER OF THE POPULATION IS SCATTERED IN SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES, WITH 1.2 PERSONS PER SQUARE MILE. ALASKA IS A FRONTIER STATE. THE POPULATION IS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE BUT HAS REPRESENTATION OF ALL RACIAL GROUPS. IN 2017, 81.1% OF ALASKANS WERE AT OR ABOVE THE POVERTY RATE BASED 125% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY THRESHOLD, WHICH IS BELOW THE 90% GOAL FOR HEALTHY ALASKANS 2020. FOR ALASKA NATIVE PEOPLE, 68.2% WERE AT OR ABOVE THE 125% POVERTY RATE. ALASKA NATIVE PEOPLE HAVE LOWER RATES OF EXCEEDING THE 125% POVERTY THRESHOLD THAN DO ALASKANS IN GENERAL OVER TIME, ACCORDING TO THE ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES. THE POVERTY RATE IN 2019 IN ANCHORAGE IS 9.2%, IN MATSU IT IS 9.1%, IN FAIRBANKS IT IS 8.9%, IN JUNEAU IT IS 7.9%, IN KENAI AREA IT IS 12.4%, AND IN THE SOUTHEAST FAIRBANKS REGION IT IS 13.4%. (INDEX MUNDI) IN EACH OF THESE DISTRICTS THE PERCENTAGE OF ALASKA NATIVES LIVING THERE IS HIGH, AND THEY ARE THE HARDEST HIT ECONOMICALLY. WE WILL BE TARGETING THE ALASKA NATIVE POPULATION OVER THE NEXT YEAR. OBESITY IS A PROBLEM IN ALASKA. ACCORDING TO THE ALASKA HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT IN 2019 TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE ADULTS IN ALASKA IS OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. THEY FURTHER STATED THAT 31% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, 53% OF MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AND GRADE SCHOOLERS, AND 36% OF TODDLERS UNDER THE AGE OF THREE ARE OVERWEIGHT. ALASKA NOW HAS THE 15TH HIGHEST ADULT OBESITY RATE IN THE NATION, ( BIENER,ADAM, ET AL, 2019) ALASKA'S ADULT OBESITY RATE IN 2019 IS 29.5% (AMERICA\u2019S HEALTH RANKINGS) WHERE A THE RATE WERE AT 23.5 PERCENT IN 2004 AND FROM 15.7 PERCENT IN 1995. IN 2007, THIRTY PERCENT OF ALASKA NATIVE CLINIC PATIENTS BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWO AND FIVE WERE REPORTED AS OBESE (FENAUGHTY, FINK, PECK, <(>&<)> UTERMOHLE, 2009). WE OFTEN THINK OF CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED SOFT DRINKS IN RELATION TO YOUTH, ADOLESCENTS, AND ADULTS, BUT A 2006 FOOD RECALL STUDY REVEALED A STRIKING STATISTIC OF 29% OF TODDLERS STATEWIDE AND 58% IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHWEST AREAS OF ALASKA CONSUMED AT LEAST SOME IN THE PREVIOUS DAY (FENAUGHTY, FINK, PECK, WELLS , UTERMOHLE, <(>&<)> PETERSON, 2009). 50% OF ALASKA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, AND 23% OF ADULTS DRINK ONE OF MORE SODA OR SUGARY DRINK EACH DAY (2018 ALASKA CHILDHOOD UNDERSTANDING BEHAVIORS SURVEY). OUR PARAPROFESSIONALS WORK WITH MANY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. WE ARE CONSTANTLY NETWORKING AND WORKING TOWARDS EXPANDING OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH NEW ORGANIZATIONS. SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE WILL APPROACH ARE WOMEN'S SHELTERS, SCHOOL DISTRICTS, FOOD BANKS, AND MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. THE OTHER APPROACH THAT WE WILL TAKE IS TO VERIFY WE HAVE CONTACTS IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT WE CAN UTILIZE AS AN \"IN\" TO REACH THE ORGANIZATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE ARE PROVIDING SERVICES FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IN ONE COMMUNITY, WE CAN THEN PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY, LETTING THEM KNOW THAT OUR PROGRAM REALLY WORKS, THAT IT IS RELEVANT AND THAT IT IS IN DEMAND. WE ALSO PLAN ON WORKING CLOSELY WITH FOOD BANKS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PICK HEALTHIER OPTIONS WHEN THEY ARE CHOOSING THE FOODS, THEY TAKE IN THEIR BOXES THEY PICK. ANCHORAGE, MATSU, FAIRBANKS, JUNEAU, KENAI, JUNEAU, AND THE SOUTHEAST FAIRBANKS BOROUGHS HAVE THE HIGHEST POPULATIONS, BUT ALSO THE HIGHEST POVERTY LEVELS IN THE STATE OF ALASKA. ACCORDING TO THE ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES (2019) THE FOLLOWING PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATIONRECEIVED SNAP BENEFITS: 8.4% IN ANCHORAGE, 11.6% IN FAIRBANKS, 13.8% IN KENAI, 7.3% IN JUNEAU, AND 8.8% IN THE SOUTHEAST FAIRBANKS BOROUGH. OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVING SNAP BENEFIT 57% OF THOSE WERE  HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN. WE HAVE SELECTED THESE COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST POPULATIONS WITH THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF NEED. WE ARE TARGETING AUDIENCES THAT ARE BELOW THE POVERTY LINES, INCLUDING YOUTH, AND PARENTS AND GUARDIANS OF CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY ALASKAN NATIVES. ALASKA NATIVES ARE SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY GROUPS IN ALASKA. WE WILL ALSO BE TARGETING OTHER LOW-INCOME MINORITY GROUPS, ESPECIALLY IN ANCHORAGE AND FAIRBANKS. THE POVERTY RATES ARE ESPECIALLY HIGH OUT IN THE RURAL AREAS OF ALASKA. WE ARE TARGETING CLIENTELE THROUGH THE PARTNERSHIPS AND ORGANIZATIONS, AND WE ARE TEACHING AT TITLE I SCHOOLS. WE TEACH 6 \u2013 8 LESSONS TO OUR TARGET AUDIENCE USING EVIDENCED BASED CURRICULUM WITH TEACHES THE BASICS OF NUTRITION, FOOD SAFETY, FOOD PLANNING AND BUDGETING, FOOD SECURITY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. WE ENGAGE THE PARTICIPANTS IN HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES AND CURRENT INFORMATION FOLLOWING THE USDA GUIDELINES AND MYPLATE. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO COOK NUTRITIOUS AND TASTY MEALS WHILE COOKING ON A BUDGET. THE CLIENTELE LEARNS KNIFE SAFETY SKILLS, PROPER HANDLING OF FOOD, AND THE RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES FOR COOKING MEATS AND STORING THEM. CLIENTELE ENGAGE IN FUN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING EACH LESSON WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR OWN ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF CLASS. ALASKA HAS THREE MAIN GOALS: \u2022 INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME PER WEEK THE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS (GRADES 6 \u2013 8) ARE ACTIVE PER WEEK. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH BRINGING MORE \u201cFUN\u201d INTO OUR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LESSONS. THE GOAL IS TO SHOW YOUTH THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS ENJOYABLE AND SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN. \u2022 ENCOURAGE ADULTS TO EAT MORE VEGETABLES. WE WILL DO THIS THROUGH LESSONS REGARDING THE BENEFITS OF EATING MORE VEGETABLES DAILY. WE WILL ALSO INTRODUCE THEM TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEGETABLES THROUGH OUR COOKING DEMONSTRATIONS. \u2022 ENCOURAGE ADULTS TO COMPARE PRICES WHEN SHOPPING FOR FOOD. WITH THE RECENT INCREASE IN FOOD PRICES THIS IS A SKILL THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. OUR EDUCATORS WILL TEACH OUR ADULT CLIENTELE HOW TO COMPARE PRICES THROUGH COMPARING PRICING LABELS, USING COUPONS TO GET BETTER PRICES, AND TO SHOP FOR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN SEASON. ALASKA SUFFERS FROM INCREASING FOOD PRICES AND A DECREASE IN FOOD SUPPLIES AVAILABLE IN GROCERY STORES. IT IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO EDUCATE THOSE MOST IN NEED OF THE VALUE OF NUTRIENT DENSE FOODS, PROVIDING THEM WITH THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR DOLLARS IN THE GROCERY STORES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
