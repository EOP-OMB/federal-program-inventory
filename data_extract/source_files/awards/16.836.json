THE PUBLIC DEFENDER\u2019S JUVENILE OFFICE (PDJV) WITHIN PIMA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENSE SERVICES (PDS), ALONG WITH THEIR SUB-RECIPIENT, TUCSON SECOND CHANCE COMMUNITY BAIL FUND (TSCCBF), WILL DEVELOP A PILOT VICTIM RESTITUTION ASSISTANCE PROJECT FOR CLIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PAY COURT-ORDERED VICTIM RESTITUTION.\u00a0 \n\nTHE INABILITY TO PAY RESTITUTION IS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER THAT INHIBITS DEFENDANTS\u2019 ABILITY TO RESOLVE PERSONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF RECIDIVISM. THERE IS A LACK OF RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF UNPAID VICTIM RESTITUTION (OR RESTITUTION ASSISTANCE) ON JUVENILE VIOLENT CRIME OR RECIDIVISM. ANECDOTALLY, PDJV ATTORNEYS POINT TO THE YEARS-LONG BURDEN OF UNPAID RESTITUTION AS A FACTOR IN RECIDIVISM. UNPAID RESTITUTION CAN LEAD TO EXTENDED PERIODS OF COURT INVOLVEMENT, THE INABILITY TO DESTROY JUVENILE COURT RECORDS, AND OTHER COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES.\u00a0 THESE CONSEQUENCES IMPAIR THE YOUTHS\u2019 ABILITY TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND SOMETIMES HOUSING, THEREBY FUELING ONGOING RISK OF DELINQUENCY AND/OR CRIMINAL INVOLVEMENT.

THEY ARE 1) IDENTIFICATION OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS IN NEED OF VICTIM RESTITUTION ASSISTANCE BY THEIR DEFENSE REPRESENTATION TEAM AND TSCCBF BASED ON AN ELIGIBILITY RUBRIC; 2) REFERRAL OF APPLICANTS TO TSCCBF, THE PAYER; 3) EVALUATION BY THE TSCCBF; 4) PAYMENT OF COURT-ORDERED VICTIM RESTITUTION BY THE TSCCBF; AND 5) DATA COLLECTION, EVALUATION AND REPORTING. THE DESIRED OUTCOMES ARE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RECORDS DESTRUCTION; INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS RECEIVING FULL PAYMENT OF RESTITUTION, FULL RESOLUTION, RESTORATION AND REDUCED RECIDIVISM AMONG RECIPIENTS OF ASSISTANCE. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM WILL BE REEVALUATED EACH YEAR TO DETERMINE PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS AND MEMBERS OF BIPOC COMMUNITIES. THE EVALUATION WILL FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT ARE RESOLVED, THE SPEED WITH WHICH CASES ARE RESOLVED, THE RECIDIVISM RATE OF THE JUVENILES WHO ARE ASSISTED BY THE PROGRAM, AND RELEVANT SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS.
