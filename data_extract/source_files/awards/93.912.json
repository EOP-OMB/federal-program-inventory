THE TEAM, WHICH INCLUDES FACULTY FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS FROM THE COLLEGES OF BUSINESS AND PUBLIC HEALTH, HAS OVER 80 YEARS OF COMBINED EXPERIENCE PROVIDING DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO RURAL HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITIES. WITH THE SUPPORT OF OTHER INDUSTRY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND RURAL HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS, THE TEAM WILL COLLABORATE WITH PARTICIPATING RURAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITIES TO (A) ENGAGE HOSPITAL COMMUNITIES AND FEDERAL AGENCY STAKEHOLDERS IN DESIGNING, MARKETING LAUNCHING, AND IMPLEMENTING OF PROPOSED PROGRAM ACTIVITIES; (B) DELIVER TAILORED AND RESPONSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HOSPITAL COMMUNITIES THAT FACILITATES THE ASSESSMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH AND HOSPITAL NEEDS AND RESOURCES; (C) PROVIDE TAILORED AND RESPONSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HOSPITAL COMMUNITIES ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMUNITY-DRIVEN STRATEGIES TO ASSURE RESIDENTS IN RURAL AREAS CONTINUE TO HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES LOCALLY; (D) DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE EVIDENCE-BASED TRAINING, RECOMMENDATIONS AND RESOURCES ON THE STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING ROBUST RURAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT LOCAL SERVICE DELIVERY AND; (E) MONITOR, AND EVALUATE TECHNICAL  ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES, AND THE BROADER IMPACT OF THE TTARHP. WE PROPOSE A NOVEL LAYERED HOSPITAL SELECTION PROCESS THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BOTH HOSPITAL FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY AND COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY. WE USE A TIERED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE STRUCTURE TO TARGET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BASED ON HOSPITAL NEED, ALLOWING US TO SERVE A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF AT-RISK RURAL HOSPITALS IN THE UNITED STATES WHILE FOCUSING MORE INTENTLY ON THE MOST AT-RISK HOSPITALS. THIS APPROACH ALSO ENABLES HOSPITALS TO OPT-IN TO TA-RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT MATCH THEIR CAPACITY AND INTERESTS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR PROPOSAL IS NOVEL IN THAT IT TAKES A COMMUNITY-BASED AND COMMUNITY-DRIVEN APPROACH TO RURAL HEALTH PLANNING FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE RURAL HOSPITALS, EMPHASIZING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COALITION BUILDING. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DELIVERED AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM WILL HELP RURAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITIES IMPLEMENT A PRIORITIZED STRATEGY FOR KEEPING ESSENTIAL SERVICES LOCAL BY BUILDING HOSPITAL CAPACITY IN EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION-MAKING, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL IMPROVEMENT, STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT, COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP AND COALITION BUILDING, PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION.

TREATING THE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AFFECTED BY LONG-COVID REQUIRES A MULTISPECIALTY APPROACH USING PULMONARY REHABILITATION (PR).[3] DESPITE THE NEED FOR A MULTISPECIALTY PR APPROACH, LIMITED ACCESS TO SPECIALTY HEALTHCARE AND WORKFORCE SHORTAGES, ARE BARRIERS IN RURAL AREAS. MOST (73%) RURAL U.S. COUNTIES LACK AN OUTPATIENT PR PROGRAM.[4] RURAL COMMUNITIES ALSO FACE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES.[5] IN KANSAS, 90 COUNTIES (86%) ARE DESIGNATED AS PRIMARY CARE HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSAS). MULTIDISC IPLINARY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WITH SPECIALTY TRAINING TO SUPPORT LONG-COVID TREATMENT ARE NEEDED TO SERVE RESIDENTS IN RURAL AREAS.

IN ADDITION, OUR COMMUNITIES DO NOT OFFER INTERCOUNTY TRANSPORTATION, AND ALL BY LEWIS COUNTY ARE NOT ON AN INTERSTATE.   THE NETWORK PARTNERS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH RURAL UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ELKINS, WEST VIRGINIA, IS THE LARGEST CITY IN ALL THE COUNTIES WE EXPECT TO SERVE, AND ITS POPULATION WAS 6,990 IN 2019.    THE PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS LIVING IN POVERTY IN 2017. OVERALL, NEARLY ONE IN FIVE (19%) WEST VIRGINIA ADULTS LIVE IN POVERTY COMPARED TO OVER ONE IN TEN (12%) ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES. LOOKING AT THE SERVICE AREA, WEBSTER COUNTY HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS LIVING IN POVERTY (28%), FOLLOWED BY UPSHUR COUNTY (23%), BARBOUR COUNTY (21%), AND RANDOLPH (20%). TUCKER COUNTY EXPERIENCED THE LOWEST POVERTY RATE, WITH ONE IN SIX (16%) ADULTS LIVING IN POVERTY. EDUCATION LEVELS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CORRELATE TO ITS OVER ALL HEALTH AND WELFARE. OVERALL IN 2017, RESIDENTS IN THE SERVICE AREA COUNTIES TEND TO BE LESS EDUCATED THAN RESIDENTS IN WEST VIRGINIA. ONE IN SIX (16%) RESIDENTS IN THE SERVICE AREA HAVE A BACHELOR'S OR GRADUATE DEGREE COMPARED TO 20% STATEWIDE. ADDITIONALLY, NEARLY HALF (47%) OF THE RESIDENTS IN THE SERVICE AREA ARE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES, WHILE ONE IN SIX (17%) DON'T HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.   OUR 2018 DATA SHOWS THAT THE LOCAL POPULATION SUFFERS FROM POOR HEALTH DUE TO OBESITY, INACTIVITY, AND UNHEALTHY FOOD INGREDIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, MORE THAN A THIRD (35%) OF THE RESIDENTS OF TUCKER COUNTY DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY; HOWEVER, 99% OF THE RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES. IN BARBOUR COUNTY, OVER A THIRD (36%) OF RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO EXERCISE OPPORTUNITIES, WHILE ANOTHER THIRD (37%) ARE OBESE.  RANDOLPH COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY HAS LED NETWORKS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS, AS SEEN IN DEVELOPING AND RUNNING WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR AGES 16 AND OLDER.

THE MA ARWTN IS COMPRISED OF THREE AHECS WHICH ARE PART OF THE MASSAHEC NETWORK: THE CAPE & ISLANDS AHEC, BAYSTATE FRANKLIN AHEC, AND BERKSHIRE AHEC. THESE AHECS \u2013 ONE FROM FAR EASTERN, ONE FROM CENTRAL, AND ONE FROM FAR WESTERN PART OF THE STATE \u2013 ARE THE THREE GOVERNANCE PARTNERS FOR THIS PROJECT, AS DOCUMENTED IN A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SIGNED BY THE PARTNERS IN FEBRUARY 2022. THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH PROPOSES TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL HEALTH WORKFORCE DEFICIT ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH BY SHARING RESOURCES AND LEARNING AMONG THE THREE COMMITTED AHECS AND THEIR NETWORK PARTNERS. THE WIDER NETWORK INCLUDES THREE CLINICAL PARTNERS WHICH SERVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RURAL REGIONS, INCLUDING OUTER CAPE HEALTH SERVICES, SERVING THE RURAL OUTER CAPE COD (BARNSTABLE COUNTY) REGION, BAYSTATE FRANKLIN MEDICAL CENTER/UMASS CHAN MEDICAL SCHOOL FAMILY RESIDENCY PROGRAM, SERVING ALL OF FRANKLIN COUNTY, AND COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS, SERVING THE RURAL BERKSHIRE COUNTY COMMUNITIES. THESE CLINICAL PARTNERS WILL PROVIDE INPUT ABOUT WORKFORCE NEEDS AND SERVE AS EMPLOYERS FOR WORKFORCE TRAINED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. TWO EDUCATION NETWORK PARTNERS, CAPE COD COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND BERKSHIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WILL DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND DELIVER TRAINING AND CROSS-TRAINING CURRICULA THAT CAN BE PROVIDED VIA DISTANCE LEARNING MODES ACROSS THE ENTIRE RURAL WORKFORCE NETWORK.  THE MA ARWTN WILL FOCUS ON TRACK 1, COMMUNITY HEALTH SUPPORT, SPECIFICALLY ON TRAINING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHWS). THE NEED FOR ALL CLINICAL WORKFORCE HAS BEEN GROWING DRAMATICALLY, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BEGAN IN EARLY 2020. ALL THE CLINICAL PARTNERS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM REPORT SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE NEED FOR SERVICES IS RISING. CHWS HAVE EVOLVED AS A VITAL TOOL IN ADDRESSING NEEDS DUE TO CHRONIC CONDITIONS, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, AND SERVICE COORDINATION IN COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS. COMPETITION FOR CHWS HAS BECOME A LIMITING FACTOR AS THE AVAILABLE POOL OF POTENTIAL WORKERS HAS DECREASED. IN ADDITION, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS REPORT INCREASING NEED TO TAKE A HEALTH EQUITY-BASED APPROACH TO ENSURE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES. TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF CHWS, THE MA ARWTN PROPOSES TO TARGET UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS SUCH AS IMMIGRANT AND MIGRANT WORKFORCE, MANY OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY WORKING IN LOW-PAYING, UNBENEFITED JOBS IN THE SERVICE, TOURISM, HOSPITALITY, AGRICULTURAL, FISHING, AND OTHER SECTORS IN RURAL AREAS. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A MUCH-NEEDED SOURCE OF WORKFORCE, THESE NEW WORKERS WILL HELP CREATE A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE. AT THE SAME TIME, THESE NEW WORKERS WILL PROVIDE INCREASED CAPACITY TO REACH PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHO MAY BE UNDERSERVED AND ISOLATED BY LANGUAGE, CULTURE, ETHNICITY, AND RACE. THE PROGRAM PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER TRAINING IN LANGUAGES INCLUDING SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE, WHICH ARE SPOKEN AT HOME BY MANY OF THE TARGET POPULATION BEING SERVED. IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF NEW WORKERS, THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE TRAINING FOR INCUMBENT WORKERS WHO ARE OR MAY BECOME CHWS. THIS WILL STRENGTHEN EXISTING WORKFORCE AS WELL AS PROVIDING A CAREER GROWTH PATH. A KEY FOCUS OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE TO PROVIDE CROSS-TRAINING IN AREAS SUCH AS BILLING AND CODING, ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SCRIBE/CHART SUPPORT, SERVICE COORDINATION, PEER RECOVERY SUPPORT, CRISIS INTERVENTION, BENEFITS COUNSELING AND HEALTH PROMOTION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 0.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f9816770-22ec-e62d-5ef6-de9c406d5e7f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_TR145927_7526"}, {"internal_id": 150745801, "Award ID": "TR145926", "Award Amount": 1544093.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-07-25", "CFDA Number": "93.912", "Description": "RURAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE TRAINING NETWORK PROGRAM - PROJECT DIRECTOR: ROBERT DUEHMIG, INTERIM DIRECTOR, DUEHMIGR@OHSU.EDU, 503-494-5540   WORKFORCE TRAINING TRACKS: TRACK 1 AND TRACK 3    SERVICE AREA: CROOK, JEFFERSON, KLAMATH, MALHEUR, WASCO, AND WHEELER COUNTIES AND THE RURAL PORTIONS OF DESCHUTES AND LANE COUNTIES.

HIGH CHRONIC DISEASE PREVALENCE PLAGUES COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN SUNFLOWER COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI. THE RESULT IS THAT SUNFLOWER COUNTY RANKS AS ONE OF THE LEAST HEALTHY COUNTIES IN MISSISSIPPI, AS #71 OF 82 RANKED COUNTIES. WHILE MOST OF THE COUNTY IDENTIFIES AS ONLY BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN (77%), THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME DIFFERS BY $47,300 BETWEEN BLACK RESIDENTS ($26,500) AND WHITE RESIDENTS ($73,800). TO FULLY SERVE THE MOST MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN SUNFLOWER COUNTY, MEANING THE LOW-INCOME BLACK RESIDENTS, SSCH STAFF CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) IN 2022. AN ONLINE COMMUNITY SURVEY (N=59) OFFERING INSIGHTS INTO THE HEALTH OF THE SUNFLOWER COUNTY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE COUNTY\u2019S RESIDENTS. RESPONDENTS IDENTIFIED ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF A HEALTHY COMMUNITY AND NOTED HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, DIABETES, AND OBESITY AS DISEASES OF CONCERN. MEANWHILE, ONE THIRD OF ALL RESPONDENTS NOTED CONCERN REGARDING RACISM WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY. WHILE SERVING RESIDENTS WITHIN THIS COMPLEX CONTEXT, SSCH HAS RECEIVED PRIOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS PART OF THE 2018 COHORT OF HOSPITALS IN THE DELTA REGION COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (DRCHSD). THOSE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RECOMMENDATIONS LED TO IMPROVEMENTS AT SSCH IN THEIR FINANCES AND CLINICAL OPERATIONS AND TO ADDITIONS IN SERVICE LINES NEEDED TO ADDRESS LOCAL COMMUNITY HEALTH CONCERNS. OF THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED AT SSCH, NONE TO DATE ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF HIGH NURSE TURNOVER AND HIGH NURSE VACANCY RATES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE WORKFORCE CONCERNS FACED BROADLY THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.  RESPONSE SSCH REQUIRES SUPPORT IN TRAINING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED NURSING STAFF. NURSE RETENTION CAN IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE AND COMMUNITY TRUST IN THE LOCAL HEALTH SYSTEM. HOWEVER, FINANCING NURSE STUDENT EXTERNSHIPS CAN BE COST PROHIBITIVE FOR A SMALL, RURAL HOSPITAL WITH A TIGHT OPERATING BUDGET. THUS , THE MS EARN PILOT PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE PAID, THREE-SEMESTER LONG EXTERNSHIPS TO ASSOCIATE DEGREE NURSING STUDENTS MATCHED WITH SSCH OVER THE 2024-25 ACADEMIC YEAR. THE PROPOSED PROJECT BUILDS UPON THE CURRENT MS SUMMER STUDENT EXTERNSHIP PROGRAM BY OFFERING A LONGER PERIOD OF TRAINING WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXTERN AND HOSPITAL STAFF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REGARDING HEALTH EQUITY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN CLINICAL SETTINGS.  IMPACT IN THE SHORT TERM, THIS PROJECT WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NURSES PRESENT AT SSCH, EQUIP STAFF, INCLUDING NURSE EXTERNS, TO WORK EFFECTIVELY ACROSS DIVERSITY IN RACE AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND, PROVIDE NURSE EXTERNS WITH VALUABLE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN PREPARATION FOR THEIR NCLEX LICENSING EXAM, AND ENABLE MORE EFFICIENT PATIENT DISCHARGE AND BED TURNOVER. THESE CHANGES WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT THE HOSPITAL IN TERMS OF STAFF TURNOVER AND BURNOUT, WHILE IMPROVING CARE AVAILABLE TO THE UNDERSERVED, BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION OF SUNFLOWER COUNTY. IN THE LONG TERM, THIS PROJECT WILL BE USED AS MODEL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI TO IMPROVE NURSE STUDENT EXTERNSHIP TRAINING IN TERMS OF CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AND EQUITABLE PATIENT ADVOCACY.

ICMC IS PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN THE TOWN OF PILOT KNOB IN IRON COUNTY. ICMC PRIMARILY SERVES PATIENTS FROM IRON COUNTY BUT ALSO SERVES PATIENTS FROM SAINT FRANCOIS, REYNOLDS, MADISON, AND WASHINGTON COUNTIES. ICMC OPERATES A LABORATORY, PHARMACY, AND A RURAL HEALTH CLINIC (RHC). HOSPITAL SERVICES INCLUDE RADIOLOGY, LABORATORY, INPATIENT CARE, NEXT STEPS \u2013 SWING BED, OUTPATIENT THERAPIES FOR PHYSICAL, OCCUPATIONAL AND SPEECH, SURGERY, RESPIRATORY, CARDIAC REHAB, EMERGENCY SERVICES, AND PHARMACY INFUSIONS. THE FAMILY CARE CLINIC PROVIDES CARDIOLOGY, UROLOGY, GASTROENTEROLOGY, EAR, NOSE, AND THROAT (ENT), RHEUMATOLOGY, PODIATRY, AND ENDOCRINOLOGY AND NEPHROLOGY SERVICES VIA TELEMEDICINE. OTHER SERVICES INCLUDE DIETARY CONSULTING, HEALTH TESTING, IMAGING SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING X-RAY, ULTRASOUND, AND CT SCAN AND COUNSELING SERVICES FOR PATIENTS RECOVERING FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA, SURGERY, AND INJURY.  THE POPULATION TO BE SERVED HAS SYSTEMATICALLY EXPERIENCED GREATER OBSTACLES TO HEALTH BECAUSE OF THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION, AND LONGER DISTANCES TO ACCESS THE LIMITED CARE THAT IS AVAILABLE LOCALLY. PRACTITIONER SHORTAGES AND FACILITY CLOSURES IN RURAL AREAS FURTHER IMPEDE ACCESS TO CARE, WHICH THE POPULATION HAS FEARED ITS LOCAL HOSPITAL CLOSING FOR MULTIPLE YEARS. ADDITIONAL HEALTH DISPARITIES INCLUDE LOWER PAYING JOBS, LESS EDUCATION, AND LACK HEALTH LITERACY. INDICATORS FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE NOTABLY GREATER IN IRON COUNTY. OTHER DISPARITIES INCLUDE THE AGING POPULATION, THOSE WITH DISABILITIES, AND THE UNINSURED. A QUARTER OF IRON COUNTY\u2019S POPULATION HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO HAVE A DISABILITY STATUS, AND ALMOST HALF OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE 64 AND OLDER, CREATING A SUBSTANTIAL ELDERLY, DISABLED, VULNERABLE POPULATION. CHRONIC DISEASE INDICATORS SHOW THAT IT IS HIGHLY PREVALENT IN IRON COUNTY. ALMOST 75% OF THE MEDICARE POPULATION IN IRON COUNTY HAS MULTIPLE CHRONIC DISEASES. THE MORTALITY RATES FOR HEART DISEASE AND LUNG DISEASE IN IRON COUNTY ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, DOUBLING FOR LUNG DISEASE.

INNIS COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER DBA ARBOR FAMILY HEALTH (AFH) CONTINUES TO ATTEMPT TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES, PROVIDING ESSENTIAL, ACCESSIBLE, QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES TO ITS COMMUNITY.  AFH WILL COLLABORATE WITH XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA, AMERICA\u2019S ONLY HISTORICALLY BLACK AND CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY; ITS COLLEGE OF PHARMACY IS AMONG THE TOP PRODUCERS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PHARMACISTS.  ACCORDING TO AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION O MARCH 5, 2021, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED IN PRIMARY CARE TO PROACTIVELY PREVENT, IDENTIFY, AND RESOLVE POOR MEDICATION-RELATED OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, MORE THAN 80% OF PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES DO NOT HAVE CLINICAL PHARMACISTS AS MEMBERS OF EXPANDED CARE TEAMS. THE EMERGENCE OF ECONSULT SERVICES IN PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS (PCPS) TO CONSULT WITH CLINICAL PHARMACISTS AS \u201cON-DEMAND\u201d PHARMACOTHERAPY SPECIALISTS.

WITH ITS PROPOSED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MODEL CENTERED ON TEAMSTEPPS, THE ACC WILL ENHANCE TEAM COMMUNICATION AS A FOUNDATION FOR STREAMLINING CARE TRANSITIONS AND COORDINATION, BUILDING SERVICE CAPACITY, ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, AND ADVANCING READINESS TO EXPAND PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT STRATEGIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY. CIP WILL CREATE A MULTIDISCIPLINARY QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT OUR CONSORTIUM THAT IS PRIMED FOR IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES AND CAN CREATE COST SAVINGS THAT CAN SUSTAIN AND GROW THE MODEL IN OUR REGION. WE WILL FOCUS ON REDUCING HOSPITALIZATIONS (ADMISSIONS AND READMISSIONS) FOR SOME OF THE MOST COMMON AND COSTLY CAUSES OF HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS IN OUR EIGHT-COUNTY REGION OF SOUTHEASTERN OHIO AND WESTERN WEST VIRGINIA.  OUR OLDER ADULT PATIENT POPULATION IS PRONE TO HIGH LEVELS OF PNEUMONIA, CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, SEPSIS, AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES THAT ARE AMONG THE LEADING CAUSES OF AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS, READMISSIONS, AND DEATH. WHILE THIS PARTNERSHIP SEES POTENTIAL TO APPLY THIS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY ACROSS MANY MAJOR CONDITIONS OF CONCERN, OUR PROJECT WILL FOCUS OUR COMMUNICATIONS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MODEL ON PNEUMONIA, CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, AND SEPSIS IN YEARS 1 AND 2, THEN APPLY THE MODEL TO COPD AND UTI IN YEARS 3 AND 4. TO DO THIS WORK IN A COORDINATED, CROSS-SYSTEM FASHION, HOLZER HEALTH SYSTEM WILL FORMALLY PARTNER WITH OHIO VALLEY PHYSICIANS (OVP), AND THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING DISTRICT 7 (AAA7) TO COMMISSION AND TRAIN MULTIDISCIPLINARY QUALITY IMPROVEMENT TEAM(S) TO EXTEND A SUITE OF SERVICES TO DEFINED SETS OF OLDER ADULT PATIENTS 60 AND OLDER.  OUR GOAL IS  TO ENABLE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION ACROSS PROVIDER TYPES AND WITHIN MULTIPLE LEVELS OF CARE, TRANSITIONING AND STABILIZING OLDER ADULTS THROUGH CARE SERVICES AND INTO THE COMMUNITY. MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM COMPOSITION SHOULD REPRESENT A CROSS-SECTION OF STAFF ACROSS LEVELS OF CARE, INCLUDING ACUTE, POST-ACUTE, AMBULATORY, PRIMARY CARE, HOME HEALTH, SPECIALISTS, AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES. THE ACC WILL 1) DEDICATE STAFF CAPACITY TO CROSS-SYSTEM MULTIDISCIPLINARY QUALITY IMPROVEMENT TEAMS (INCLUSIVE OF  CARE MANAGERS AND DISCHARGE PLANNERS) TO IMPROVE TRANSITIONS OF CARE AND EXPAND SERVICES FOR INDICATED OLDER ADULT PATIENTS; 2) TRAIN TEAMS IN PROVEN COMMUNICATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MODELS LIKE TEAMSTEPPS, TEACH BACK AND ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT METHODS; 3) TEST AND EXTEND EFFECTIVE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PRACTICE CHANGES, CARE HANDOFFS AND DISCHARGE PLANNING THROUGH SERVICES TO OUR PATIENTS; 4) LINK ELIGIBLE PATIENTS TO THE AAA7\u2019S HOSPITAL2HOME SERVICE AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE REFERRALS; AND 5) EXPAND AND EXPLORE PAYMENT AND SAVINGS STRATEGIES TO SUSTAIN THESE ENHANCED SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS.  WE BELIEVE THESE ACTIONS WILL RESULT IN POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN EACH OF THE THREE REQUIRED IMPACT AREAS: 1) IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES EVIDENCED BY OLDER ADULTS LIVING HEALTHIER LIVES AT HOME, AVOIDING UNNECESSARY HOSPITALIZATIONS AND READMISSIONS FOR PNEUMONIA, CHF, COPD, SEPSIS AND UTI; 2) EXPANDED CAPACITY FOR ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES BY INCREASING CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES WITHIN A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNICATIONS AND QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OLDER ADULT PATIENTS; AND 3) INCREASED FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY DEMONSTRATED THROUGH NEW OR EXPANDED BILLING OR PAYMENT INCENTIVE STRATEGIES AND POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS FROM REDUCED ADMISSIONS AND READMISSIONS.

NHC HAS SEEN THESE NUMBERS GROW OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN MONTHS AND EXPECT THIS NUMBER TO CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE COMING MONTHS, PARTLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT RURAL COMMUNITIES MORE SIGNIFICANTLY.  RURAL PATIENTS TEND TO BE HIGH-RISK PATIENTS THAT STRUGGLE WITH THEIR HEALTH AND NEED THE SUPPORT FROM A HEALTHCARE TEAM TO IDENTIFY HEALTHCARE CONCERNS, HOW TO CREATE A PLAN TO OVERCOME THESE CONCERNS AND HOW TO REMAIN COMMITTED TO THIS PLAN WHILE ACCESSING CARE AT THE ORGANIZATION AND ADDITIONAL  COMMUNITY PARTNERS. NHC HAS HAD A CARE COORDINATION PROGRAM FOR THIS AT-RISK PATIENT POPULATION SINCE THE ORGANIZATION OPENED ITS DOORS IN 2018. NHC PATIENTS WHO SEE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE PATIENTS WHO DEAL WITH CHRONIC DISEASES DAILY AND ARE SEEN FREQUENTLY BY NHC PROVIDERS TO MANAGE THEIR HEALTH. NHC IS LOOKING FOR ASSISTANCE FROM HRSA TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM, INCLUDE MORE COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND NHC STAFF, INCLUDING CHWS, TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM DUE TO ITS CURRENT SUCCESS IN IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES.    COVID-19 HAS ADDED AN ADDITIONAL, POTENTIALLY DEADLY RISK TO NHC\u2019S HIGHEST RISK PATIENT POPULATION. SOON AFTER THE PANDEMIC STARTED, NHC IMPLEMENTED TELEMEDICINE OPTIONS FOR THESE PATIENTS TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO CONNECT WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE TEAM WHILE ELIMINATING THE NEED TO TRAVEL OR ENTER OUR CLINIC AND THUS INCREASING THEIR RISK EXPOSURE. TH ESE VIDEO/AUDIO VISITS PROVIDED AN OPTION FOR PATIENTS TO SEEK CARE BUT UNFORTUNATELY PATIENTS HAD CHALLENGES WITH UTILIZING THIS TECHNOLOGY DUE TO LACK OF INTERNET AND/OR LACK OF SMART PHONE ACCESS. TO BRIDGE THIS GAP, NHC IS PROPOSING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING KITS THAT THE PATIENTS CAN USE AT HOME TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS IN SEEKING CARE AND PATIENT COMMITMENT TO ADHERING TO SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS AND CARE PLANS AT HOME. IMPLEMENTING REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING IN PATIENT HOMES ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE, PULSE OXIMETER, WEIGHT, TEMPERATURE AND GLUCOSE MONITORING. THIS DATA IS VITAL TO MANAGE THE PATIENT\u2019S CARE, KEEP THEM HEALTHY AT HOME AND PREVENT HOSPITALIZATIONS.   NHC IS EAGER TO SUPPORT IMPROVED HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES, EXPANDED CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO SUPPORT HEALTHCARE IMPROVEMENTS AND CARE COORDINATION. ADDITIONALLY, NHC HAS DEVELOPED A REPLICABLE MODEL THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED ACROSS VARIOUS POPULATIONS AND SERVICE LINES TO ENSURE HEALTH CENTERS CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER AND FOCUS ON IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CARE DELIVERY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null,

OUTCOMES INCLUDE IMPROVED ACCESS (THE SUPPLY OF AND ACCESS TO LOCAL CAREGIVERS AND SERVICES TO REMAIN SAFETY AT HOME, CARE COORDINATION); EXPANDED CAPACITY AND SERVICES (REDUCED TURNOVER IN THE CAREGIVING WORKFORCE AND INCREASED CAREGIVER QUALITY OF LIFE AND SATISFACTION; INCREASED COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION ACROSS AGENCIES), ENHANCED OUTCOMES (REDUCTION IN UNNECESSARY HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS; REDUCTION IN TOTAL COST OF  CARE; INCREASED CONFIDENCE ABOUT BEING ABLE TO STAY IN THE VALLEY, CLOSE TO FAMILY, FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY; INCREASED INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY QUALITY OF LIFE AND SATISFACTION), AND SUSTAINABILITY(DEMONSTRATED COST SAVINGS,INCREASED READINESS FOR VALUE-BASED CARE).    THE NETWORK MEMBERS HAVE A STRONG HISTORY OF COLLABORATION. IN 2021, IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT AGING AND SUPPORTS, NETWORK MEMBERS AND COLLABORATING ORGANIZATIONS CONVENED A VALLEY WIDE SENIOR SERVICES STRATEGIC PLANNING STUDY. THE STUDY CONFIRMED THAT THE HIGH COST OF LIVING, INCLUDING HOUSING, COUPLED WITH INADEQUATE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN EXTREMELY LIMITED WORKFORCE POOL; AND STAFFING, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE ESCALATED TO CRISIS LEVELS DURING COVID. IN 2021 THE MEMBERS SECURED A ONE-YEAR NETWORK PLANNING GRANT AND HAVE UNDERTAKEN THE WORK TO FORMALIZE THE NETWORK.

THE PROJECT SERVICE AREA SPANS ACROSS THE JURISDICTIONS OF FOUR MULTICOUNTY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHICH INCLUDES 21 COUNTIES THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS RURAL AND HAVE A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS. THE TARGET PATIENT POPULATION CONSISTS OF IDENTIFIED PATIENTS THAT PRESENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS, AS WELL AS SOCIAL NEEDS, LIVING WITHIN THE PROJECT SERVICE AREA. THESE PATIENTS CAN BE OF ANY AGE, RACE, OR ETHNICITY, BUT THE DATA ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT RESIDENTS LIVING IN THIS SERVICE AREA ARE TRADITIONALLY OLDER, SICKER, AND POORER.   THE CATCH NETWORK WAS FORMED IN 1994. IT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATION BETWEEN LHDS AND PRIMARY CARE CLINICS AND STRIVES TO PROMOTE COMMUNITY HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT BY CONNECTING PEOPLE, IDEAS, AND RESOURCES. THERE ARE CURRENTLY 26 MEMBERS: SIX LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (LHDS), TEN HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, EIGHT CLINICS, ONE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE CLINIC, AND ONE COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY. FOR THIS PROJECT, FOUR LHDS AND FOUR RURAL HEALTH CLINICS WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES.    ACTIVITIES WILL BE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE CAPACITY TO DELIVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ADDRESSING SOCIAL NEEDS. ONE ACTIVITY IS TO IDENTIFY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS AN D DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR INTEGRATING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH PRIMARY CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. IT ALSO INCLUDES USING A SCREENING TOOL TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH PHYSICAL, MENTAL, LIFESTYLE RISK BEHAVIORS, AND SOCIAL NEEDS. ONCE THESE NEEDS ARE IDENTIFIED, A TREATMENT AND PREVENTION PLAN WILL BE DEVELOPED BY THE LOCAL COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE TEAM, INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN ADDRESSING THE DIMENSIONS OF LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS AND SOCIAL NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS. THESE PATIENTS WILL BE REFERRED TO LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES WHO WILL EDUCATE THEM ON HOW TO PREVENT AND CONTROL CHRONIC DISEASES AND/OR CONNECT THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS THEIR SOCIAL DETERMINANT NEEDS.   THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO IMPROVE INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION HEALTH OUTCOMES (III), REDUCE THE BARRIERS THAT LIMIT ACCESS TO CARE (I), DECREASE HEALTH CARE COSTS THROUGH A REDUCTION IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS AND AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS (III), INTEGRATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH PRIMARY CARE CLINICS AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (II), AND STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY PROGRAMS BY REFERRING HIGH-RISK PATIENTS TO PREVENTIVE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES PROVIDED BY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS (IV). THROUGH ENHANCED CARE COORDINATION OF PATIENTS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL NEEDS, THERE WILL BE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THE NETWORK WILL BECOME MORE SUSTAINABLE.
