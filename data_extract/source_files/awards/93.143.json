RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF CR(VI) CAN BE CARCINOGENIC AND DANGEROUS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. AS A RESULT, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DEMAND AMONG WATER PROVIDERS AND SUPERFUND SITES FOR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE CR(VI) CONCENTRATIONS IN WATER RESOURCES IN A COST-EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE MANNER. CURRENT TECHNICAL CHALLENGES POSED BY EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES FOR CR(VI) REMEDIATION INCLUDE HIGH COSTS, LIMITED CAPABILITIES TO ACHIEVE LOW PARTS-PER-BILLION (PPB) CONCENTRATIONS, AND THE OUTSIZED EFFECTS OF INFLUENT WATER GEOCHEMISTRY ON SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS A NEED FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO RELIABLY REDUCE CR(VI) TO LOW PARTS-PER-BILLION (PPB) LEVELS WITH LOWER COSTS AND BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES. THIS PROPOSED PHASE II PROJECT BUILDS ON SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES FROM PHASE I IN WHICH A NEW BIOLOGICAL PROCESS TECHNOLOGY WAS DEVELOPED. THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON ENHANCED BIOLOGICAL REDUCTIVE IMMOBILIZATION IN WHICH MICROORGANISMS REDUCE SOLUBLE, MOBILE, AND HIGHLY TOXIC FORMS OF SPECIFIC METALS TO OXIDATION STATES AT WHICH THE METALS ARE VERY POORLY SOLUBLE AND EASILY REMOVED FROM WATER. IN THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY, SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN NATURAL MICROORGANISMS ARE INCORPORATED INSIDE PROPRIETARY POLYMER COMPOSITES CALLED BIOCATALYSTS. THE BIOCATALYSTS ARE DESIGNED TO RETAIN, CONTROL, AND MAINTAIN A HIGHLY ACTIVE POPULATION OF THE CHOSEN MICROORGANISMS INSIDE A BIOREACTOR AS PART OF A COMPACT, HIGH-PERFORMANCE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM. IN PHASE I SUPPORT, THE CR(VI)-REMOVAL BIOCATALYSTS WERE DEVELOPED, AND A PROTOTYPE BIOREACTOR WAS DESIGNED, BUILT, AND OPERATED. UNDER CONTINUOUS FLOW CONDITIONS, THE REMOVAL OF VARIOUS INFLUENT CONCENTRATIONS OF CR(VI) WAS CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED, INCLUDING MORE THAN 99% REMOVAL TO LEVELS BELOW 1 \u039cG/L, WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE TARGET CONCENTRATION OF FIVE (5) \u039cG/L.

IN MANY CASES, THE INTENTIONAL REMEDIATION PROCESSES THAT ARE OFTEN COST- AND/OR ENERGY INTENSIVE, LEAD TO GENERATION OF UN-DESIRED DEGRADATION PRODUCTS AND/OR SECONDARY CONTAMINATION. TO AVOID THESE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS, STABILIZATION THAT SEEKS TO RETAIN PFAS IN ITS ORIGINAL ENVIRONMENT FOR LONG-TERM HAS GAINED MOMENTUM IN RECENT YEARS. TO PROMOTE THE FORMATION OF BOUND RESIDUES (BR) BETWEEN PFAS AND SOIL, DIFFERENT SORBENTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES.

MOST NOTABLY, THE USE OF GRANULAR ACTIVATED CARBON (GAC) AND ION EXCHANGE RESINS SORBENTS. AMONG THESE, GAC IS THE MOST WIDELY ACCEPTED AND COMMONLY USED TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY FOR PFAS CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER AND DRINKING WATER.

THE INCINERATOR IS ONE OF ONLY EIGHT RECEIVING PER- AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFAS) FOR INCINERATION AND RECEIVED THE MOST SHIPMENTS IN THE PAST YEAR. PFAS, REFERRED TO AS \u201cFOREVER CHEMICALS\u201d, REPRESENT A LARGE GROUP OF SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS, INCLUDING PFOA, PFOS, GENX, AND ENCOMPASS APPROXIMATELY 5000 DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS.

PFAS HAVE LONG BEEN USED AS ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN SPECIALIZED FIREFIGHTING FOAMS. IN LATE JULY 2021, PFAS-CONTAINING FIREFIGHTING FOAM WAS INADVERTENTLY INTRODUCED INTO THE DRINKING WATER SYSTEM OF THE LOWER 10TH WARD OF MCKEESPORT, PA, AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 500 RESIDENTS IN THIS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY. CURRENTLY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THIS SUBSTANCE BEHAVES WITHIN PREMISE PLUMBING. OUR PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION IN DECEMBER 2021 OF RESIDENTIAL TAP WATER FOUND TWO OUT OF 15 HOMES WITH PFAS LEVELS WELL ABOVE STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES FOR HEALTH, INDICATING THAT THE CONTAMINATION HAS PERSISTED IN THE PREMISE PLUMBING DESPITE ACTIONS BY THE WATER UTILITY TO FLUSH THE DISTRIBUTION LINES. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH PFAS IS PRESENT IN THE TAP WATER OF THE COMMUNITY AND SURROUNDING SURFACE SOILS (DUE TO HYDRANT FLUSHING) AND TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE PFAS EXPOSURE. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT PFAS-CONTAINING FIREFIGHTING FOAMS CAN FORM OR INCORPORATE INTO DEPOSITS IN RESIDENTIAL PIPES, LEADING TO LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTS. MOREOVER, WE EXPECT THAT FLUSHING HYDRANTS TO CLEAR CONTAMINATION FROM THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WILL HAVE LED TO SURFACE CONTAMINATION OF SURROUNDING SOILS, PROVIDING ANOTHER ROUTE OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR HUMANS AND WILDLIFE. WE WILL USE A COMBINATION OF WATER AND SOIL TESTING TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, AS WELL AS ESTIMATE PFAS LOADS FROM RESIDENTIAL TAPS BY ANALYZING WATER FILTERS PUT IN PLACE FOLLOWING THE CONTAMINATION EVENT AND BY DEPLOYING NEW FILTERS WITH FLOW METERS.

ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE MEETING IS FOCUS ON TRAINING OF NEW RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD, WHICH IS ACHIEVED BY INTERACTION-DRIVEN CONFERENCE DESIGN BETWEEN THE RENOWN SCHOLARS AND STUDENTS AND TRAINEES PARTICIPATING IN THE MEETING.  COMBUSTION AND THERMAL PROCESSES REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMEDIATION OF SUPERFUND SITES, ENERGY PRODUCTION, MATERIALS AND ENERGY RECOVERY AND ARE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE SUPERFUND RESEARCH PROGRAM. MAY DIFFERENT THERMAL PROCESSES ARE STILL USED TO MITIGATE AND REMEDIATE SUPERFUND SITES, WHICH INCLUDE LOW TEMPERATURE THERMAL DESORPTION/TREATMENT, CATALYTIC OXIDATION, THERMAL OXIDATION AND OFF-SITE INCINERATION. ACCIDENTAL FIRES ARE STILL COMMON AT SOME SITES. ALL OF THESE PROCESSES LEAD TO EMISSION OF TOXIC AIR POLLUTANTS, AND OFTEN THIS IS WORSE WITH THE LOW TEMPERATURE DESORPTION/TREATMENT THAN FOR ON-SITE INCINERATION. THERMAL PROCESSES ARE ALSO USED AS A WAY TO REDUCE ENERGY AND MATERIAL COSTS. MANY OF THE ENERGY RECYCLING PROCESSES COME AT A PRICE OF INCREASED EMISSION AND POLLUTION. THERE IS A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE USES OF RENEWABLE FUELS TO DECREASE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND INCREASED EMISSION OF OTHER POLLUTANTS ASSOCIATED WITH MATERIALS AND ENERGY RECOVERY. INCREASING REGULATION ON BOTH THOSE ASPECTS ARE QUITE OFTEN CONTRADICTING.

KEY MICROORGANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGH AFFINITY TO 1,4-DIOXANE IN THE MIXED CULTURE WILL BE ISOLATED AND INVESTIGATED FOR THEIR DEGRADATION INTERMEDIATES, PATHWAYS, AND KINETICS. 3) ELUCIDATION OF INTERACTIONS AMONG CONTAMINANTS, MICROBIAL CULTURES, AND THE NOVEL SORBENTS. TO ACHIEVE THIS, COMPLETELY MIXED FLOW EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED, AND THEY WILL BE COUPLED WITH MATHEMATICAL MODELING THAT INCORPORATES PHENOMENA OF BOTH SORPTION AND BIODEGRADATION IN BIOFILMS. 4) PROOF-OF-CONCEPT COLUMN STUDIES FOR BIOREMEDIATION OF CVOCS AND 1,4-DIOXANE MIXTURES. TWO LONG-TERM COLUMN STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED: EX SITU TREATMENT OF 1,4-DIOXANE AND IN SITU BIOREMEDIATION OF CVOCS AND 1,4-DIOXANE MIXTURE IN SERIES. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES WILL BE MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LEVELS FOR CVOCS AND THE HEALTH ADVISORY LEVEL FOR 1,4-DIOXANE (0.35 \u039cG/L).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "52a3bc33-b23b-0c54-7fff-2e17fbd7bfb0-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01ES032692_7529"}, {"internal_id": 130088438, "Award ID": "R01ES032686", "Award Amount": 776955.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-03-09", "CFDA Number": "93.143", "Description": "A NOVEL STRATEGY FOR ARSENIC PHYTOREMEDIATION - PROJECT SUMMARY: THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL PROJECT IS TO CHARACTERIZE ARSENATE REDUCTASE, ACR2, AS A MULTIFUNCTIONAL ENZYME FOR ITS ROLE IN ARSENIC TOLERANCE, TRANSLOCATION, AND LIMITING ACCUMULATION IN FOOD CROPS. UNDER AEROBIC CONDITIONS, PLANTS ABSORB ARSENATE (ASV) FROM SOIL THROUGH PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTERS, AND THEN ASV IN ROOTS IS ELECTROCHEMICALLY REDUCED TO ARSENITE (ASIII) BY THE ACTIVITY OF ENDOGENOUS ARSENATE REDUCTASE, ACR2, OR ITS HOMOLOGS HAC1. ASIII IS EITHER EXTRUDED OUT OF THE ROOTS OR STRONGLY BINDS TO GLUTATHIONE (GSH) AND PHYTOCHELATINS (PCS), WHICH CAUSES TRAPPING MOST AS BELOWGROUND IN THE ROOTS. PREVIOUSLY, TO ENHANCE THE TRANSLOCATION OF AS TO SHOOT TISSUES FOR PHYTOREMEDIATION PURPOSE, WE KNOCKED DOWN THE ATACR2 EXPRESSION USING RNA INTERFERENCE (RNAI) IN ARABIDOPSIS. RNAI LINES TRANSLOCATED 10- TO 16-FOLD MORE AS IN SHOOTS AND RETAINED LESS AS IN ROOTS COMPARED TO WILD-TYPE PLANTS. THEREFORE, ARSENATE REDUCTASES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE TRANSLOCATION AND ACCUMULATION OF AS IN PLANTS. CONTRARY TO THE RESULTS OF RNAI KNOCKDOWN OF ATACR2, THE OVEREXPRESSION OF ATACR2 IN ARABIDOPSIS PROVIDED STRONG TOLERANCE TO ASV AND CAUSED A 50-75% REDUCTION OF AS ACCUMULATION IN ABOVEGROUND SHOOT TISSUES. HOWEVER, THIS MULTIFUNCTIONAL ATACR2 GENE IS NOT FULLY CHARACTERIZED AND THE MODE OF ACTION IN MODULATING THE AS TOLERANCE/SENSITIVITY AND ACCUMULATION IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. ARABIDOPSIS ATACR2 CONTAINS A CANONICAL ARSENATE REDUCTASE DOMAIN \u201cHCX5R\u201d AND A HIGHLY CYSTEINE- RICH C-TERMINAL DOMAIN. THE CANONICAL \u201cHXC5R\u201d AND C-TERMINAL CYS-RICH DOMAINS ARE MISSING IN THE RECENTLY CHARACTERIZED ALTERNATE ARSENATE REDUCTASE HAC1. WE SPECULATE THAT \u201cHCX5R\u201d DOMAIN REDUCES ASV TO ASIII, WHICH BINDS TO THE CYS-RICH C-TERMINAL DOMAIN AND HENCE PROVIDES ASIII TOLERANCE. N THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL TRAINING PROJECT, THE PHD STUDENT TRAINEE WILL CHARACTERIZE THIS ATACR2 GENE TO UNDERSTAND ITS ROLE AND MECHANISM OF AS TOLERANCE AND ACCUMULATION USING A MUTATIONAL APPROACH BY REPLACING THE CONSERVED CYS-RESIDUES IN THE C- TERMINUS. RICE (ORYZA SATIVA) IS WELL KNOWN TO ACCUMULATE HIGH LEVELS OF AS IN EDIBLE GRAINS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL PROJECT IS TO TRANSLATE THE KNOWLEDGE INTO RICE VIA OVEREXPRESSING ATACR2 CONSTITUTIVELY FOR INCREASE TOLERANCE AND LIMITING AS ACCUMULATION IN THE GRAINS. THE RESULTING TRANSGENIC RICE LINES OVEREXPRESSING ATACR2 WILL BE GROWN IN AS CONTAMINATED SOILS AND WILL BE ANALYZED FOR AS TOLERANCE AND ACCUMULATION UNDER GREENHOUSE CONDITIONS.

A COMMON BIOREMEDIATION STRATEGY FOR HALOGENATED POLLUTANTS IN GROUNDWATER AND SEDIMENTS IS ANAEROBIC REDUCTIVE DEHALOGENATION BY ORGANOHALIDE-RESPIRING BACTERIA (OHRB). ALTHOUGH EFFECTIVE, OHRB-DRIVEN BIOREMEDIATION STRATEGIES ARE OFTEN INCOMPLETE IN FIELD APPLICATIONS. AN EMERGING REME- DIATION STRATEGY INVOLVING AMENDMENT OF PYROGENIC CARBONACEOUS MATTER (PCM; E.G., ACTIVATED CARBON (AC)) TO THE SUBSURFACE OFFERS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS WITH OHRB-DRIVEN BIOREMEDIATION. RECENT RESEARCH HIGH- LIGHTS THE POTENTIAL FOR PCM TO PROMOTE SYNERGISTIC INTERACTIONS AMONG OHRB AND THE AUXILIARY MICROBIAL COM- MUNITY AND SUBSEQUENTLY IMPROVE OHRB-DRIVEN BIOREMEDIATION EFFICACY. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF HOW PCM PROPERTIES BEST SUPPORT MICROBIAL NETWORK INTERACTIONS, AND THEREBY ENHANCE OHRB PERFORMANCE AND CONTAMINANT BIODEGRADATION REMAIN UNKNOWN. THESE UNKNOWNS LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OPTIMIZE OHRB PERFOR- MANCE IN BIOREMEDIATION STRATEGIES WHERE PCM IS USED. THIS PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT CLOSING THE KNOWLEDGE GAP CONCERNING SPECIFIC SURFACE EFFECTS OF PCM ON THE PERFORMANCE OF POLLUTANT-DEGRADING MICROORGANISMS, ESPE- CIALLY OHRB. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT KEY PCM PROPERTIES WILL SHAPE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND DRIVE THE EXPRESSION OF METABOLIC FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIVE DEHALOGENATION PROCESSES. ELUCIDAT- ING POSITIVE IMPACTS BETWEEN PCM AND OHRB WILL ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TAILORED PCM THAT FOSTER SYNER- GISTIC MICROBIAL NETWORK INTERACTIONS AND FACILITATE MORE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE BIOREMEDIATION. THE HYPOTHE- SIS IS BASED ON PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWING THAT OHRB-DRIVEN CE BIOTRANSFORMATION PERFORMANCE WAS IMPROVED IN THE PRESENCE OF BIOCHAR, OHRB WERE ATTACHED TO CARBON SURFACES, AND THAT PCM-LIKE TUNABLE POLYMER NET- WORKS CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY SYNTHESIZED. GUIDED BY THESE PRELIMINARY DATA, WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS BY 1) PROVIDING A TUNABLE PLATFORM FOR SYNTHESIS OF PCM-LIKE POLYMER MEMBRANES WHERE SURFACE CHARGE AND REDOX- ACTIVE PROPERTIES ARE VARIED INDIVIDUALLY, 2) QUANTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF PCM SURFACE PROPERTIES ON MICROBIAL NET- WORK INTERACTIONS AND SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE OF AN ORGANOHALIDE-RESPIRING MIXED CULTURE AND, 3) DEVELOPING TAILORED PCM FOR ENHANCED ANAEROBIC BIOREMEDIATION AND CONTAMINANT MIXTURE RETENTION AND VALIDATING MATERIAL PERFORMANCE IN MICROCOSMS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE WE WILL USE A TUNABLE PLATFORM TO CHANGE MATERIAL SURFACE PROPERTIES AND EMPLOY ADVANCED MOLECULAR MICROBIAL ECOLOGY TOOLS TO ASSESS THE IM- PACTS OF THESE PROPERTIES ON MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, FUNCTION, AND ACTIVITY INCLUDING OHRB.

THE YSRTP HAS CHOSEN TO STUDY 1,4-DIOXANE (1,4-DX) BECAUSE OF ITS COMMON OCCURRENCE IN SUPERFUND SITES AND DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES, AND ITS USEPA AND IARC CLASSIFICATION AS A POSSIBLE HUMAN CARCINOGEN. THE CARCINOGENIC MECHANISM IN THE LIVER IS UNKNOWN AND ITS INTERACTION WITH CO-OCCURRING AND CARCINOGENIC WATER CONTAMINANTS (1,1,1-TRICHLOROETHANE, 1,1,1-TRICHLOROETHYLENE, AND 1,1-DICHLOROETHANE) HAS NEVER BEEN EVALUATED IN EITHER ANIMALS OR HUMANS. GIVEN THAT LIVER CANCER INCIDENCE RATES HAVE MORE THAN TRIPLED SINCE 1980, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EVALUATE WHETHER EMERGING WATER CONTAMINANTS, SUCH AS 1,4-DX, MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS INCREASE. IMPORTANTLY, A LACK OF BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE TO OR THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF 1,4 -DX HAVE HAMPERED EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES, RISK ASSESSMENT AND SETTING STANDARDS FOR THE CONTAMINANT. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH POLARITY AND LOW BIODEGRADABILITY OF 1,4-DX RESTRICT THE ABILITY TO REMOVE IT FROM AQUIFER SYSTEMS OR DRINKING WATER. INDEED, AVAILABLE TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY IS BOTH EXPENSIVE AND NOT READILY APPLIED TO WATER SUPPLIES. THE YSRTP WILL FOSTER PROBLEM-BASED, SOLUTION-ORIENTED RESEARCH RELATED TO 1,4-DX AND ITS CO-OCCURRING CONTAMINANTS THROUGH INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO EVALUATE ENVIRONMENTAL OCCURRENCE AND HUMAN EXPOSURE, UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING BASIS OF ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS, PROVIDE COST-EFFECTIVE REMEDIAL MITIGATION SOLUTIONS AND ULTIMATELY SET THE STAGE FOR IMPROVED REGULATION OF THIS EMERGING CONTAMINANT. THE YSRTP WILL CARRY OUT HIGHLY INTERACTIVE PROJECTS TO: (A) EXAMINE THE HEALTH EFFECTS AND BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE/EFFECT TO 1,4-DX (ALONE AND AS A MIXTURE WITH ITS CO-OCCURRING CONTAMINANTS) IN ANIMAL MODELS AND HUMANS, AND (B) DEVELOP SYSTEMS TO MONITOR AND MITIGATE HUMAN EXPOSURE TO 1,4-DX IN WATER.

VOCS EMANATE FROM LANDFILLS, BROWNFIELDS, AND SUPERFUND SITES, CONTAMINATING SHALLOW SOILS AND GROUNDWATER BELOW RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES, LEADING TO EXPOSURES VIA VAPOR INTRUSION. THE CENTER FOR LEADERSHIP IN ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS AND RESEARCH (CLEAR) IS DEDICATED TO UNDERSTANDING AND MITIGATING THIS SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM WITH A FOCUS ON POST-INDUSTRIAL URBAN CENTERS. HEADQUARTERED IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN, CLEAR WILL USE DETROIT AS A STUDY SITE, WHICH HAS THE HIGHEST PTB RATE IN THE COUNTRY (15.2%) AND IS LOCATED IN A STATE WHERE 37 OF THE 67 SUPERFUND SITES MUST MANAGE VOC CONTAMINATION. CLEAR HYPOTHESIZES THAT VOC EXPOSURE THROUGH VAPOR INTRUSION DURING EARLY LIFE INCITES INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES IN MATERNAL TISSUES AND/OR THE DEVELOPING OFFSPRING THAT RE-PROGRAM THE DEVELOPING IMMUNE AND OTHER CRITICAL SYSTEMS, SETTING THE STAGE FOR PTB AND/OR ASSOCIATED ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. FIVE INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PROJECTS (E1, E2, B1, B2, B3), SUPPORTED BY FIVE CORES, WILL INVESTIGATE TOXIC MECHANISMS, EXPOSURE PATHWAYS, BIOMARKERS,

INTERNET OF THINGS AND EDGE COMPUTING FOR REAL-TIME CONTAMINANT DETECTION AND RAPID-RESPONSE, MITIGATION, AND REMEDIATION (E2); AND A CONTROLLED TOXICITY BIOASSAY USING WSU-DESIGNED SEALED CHAMBERS FOR EVALUATING REPRODUCTIVE, NEUROLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, IMMUNOLOGICAL AND MULTIGENERATIONAL RESPONSES IN ZEBRAFISH (B1); (2) STUDYING MECHANISTIC EFFECTS OF VOC EXPOSURE IN A PREGNANT MOUSE MODEL (B2); (3) APPLYING EPIDEMIOLOGIC METHODS FOR ESTIMATING EXPOSURE EFFECTS VIA HUMAN BIOLOGICAL SPECIMEN ANALYSIS (B3); APPLYING ADVANCED CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, STATISTICAL APPROACHES AND VISUALIZATION TOOLS TO OBTAIN AND INTEGRATE PROJECT DATA (CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, AND DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS CORES), THEREBY ESTABLISHING THE IMPACT OF VOC EXPOSURES ON PTB AND ASSOCIATED ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES; (4) CREATING AN INNOVATIVE MODEL FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DIVERSITY BY ENGAGING NEW TRAINEES TO SOLVE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS (RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING
