FOR EACH OF THESE ABOVE MATERIALS AND PROPERTIES THRUSTS, CDAC WILL ADDRESS NEW QUESTIONS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING:\n\u2022 HOW CAN WE UNDERSTAND, PREDICT, AND CONTROL MATTER AND MATERIALS TO VERY HIGH COMPRESSIONS?\n\u2022 WHAT NEW PHYSICS MAY EMERGE IN \u2018COLD\u2019 TO \u2018WARM\u2019 DENSE MATTER?\n\u2022 HOW CAN WE ACCURATELY DETERMINE FUNDAMENTAL THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES TO VERY HIGH P AND T?\n\u2022 HOW DO DEFECTS, GRAIN BOUNDARIES, AND INTERFACES RESPOND TO HIGH P-T CONDITIONS AND STRAIN RATES?\n\u2022 HOW CAN WE BETTER MEASURE TIME-DEPENDENT TRANSFORMATIONS, AND BRIDGE STRAIN-RATE GAPS BETWEEN STATIC, QUASI-STATIC, AND DYNAMIC COMPRESSION?\n\u2022 CAN WE BETTER DETERMINE STRENGTH, PLASTICITY, AND RHEOLOGY AT VERY HIGH P-T CONDITIONS?\n\u2022 CAN WE EXPAND THE HIGH P-T SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIER TO PRODUCE NEW, OPTIMIZED MATERIALS?\n\nCDAC WILL ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS WITH BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC COMPRESSION EXPERIMENTS TOGETHER WITH THEORY, MODELING, AND SIMULATION IN CDAC UNIVERSITY LABORATORIES AS WELL AS DOE/SC AND DOE/NNSA FACILITIES. THE WORK WILL BE ENABLED BY CONTINUED ACCESS TO CDAC\u2019S PARTNER SYNCHROTRON RADIATION FACILITIES, HIGH PRESSURE COLLABORATIVE ACCESS TEAM (HPCAT) AT THE ADVANCED PHOTON SOURCE, ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY (ANL) AND THE FRONTIER INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (FIS) BEAMLINE AT THE NATIONAL SYNCHROTRON LIGHT SOURCE II, BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY (BNL), AS WELL AS OTHER FACILITIES. THE OVERARCHING SCIENTIFIC OUTCOME IS ADVANCING FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF MATERIALS BEHAVIOR IN EXTREME CONDITIONS, WHICH IN TURN WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF MATERIALS AGING, PERFORMANCE OF NEWLY MANUFACTURED MATERIALS, MATERIALS IN MULTIPLE EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS, AND THE CREATION OF NEW MATERIALS.\n\nCDAC ENGAGEMENT WITH NNSA PROGRAMS AT ANL AND WITH ITS PARTNER GROUPS IN ILLINOIS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED BY ITS MOVE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS (UIC). CDAC WILL CONTINUE ITS ACTIVE PROGRAM IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF NEXT-GENERATION RESEARCHERS FOR STEWARDSHIP SCIENCE. IN SO DOING, CDAC WILL HOST STUDENT WORKSHOPS AND SPONSOR MEETINGS AND SYMPOSIA FOR THE BROADER COMMUNITY. THE CENTER WILL FACILITATE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT WITH NNSA LABORATORIES AND BE A VEHICLE FOR INTRODUCING EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS TO NNSA LABORATORY PROGRAMS. THE CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSELY COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ACADEMIC GROUPS, OTHER SSAA AWARDEES, AND NATIONAL LABORATORY SCIENTISTS. CDAC WILL CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE THE SSAA COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH ADDITIONAL GRANTS, WHICH SO FAR HAVE MULTIPLIED BY SEVERAL TIMES THE IMPACT AND INVESTMENT OF NNSA IN THE CENTER. FINALLY, CDAC WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT USE OF NNSA FACILITIES, INCLUDING NIF, Z, AND LANSCE, AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR NEXT-GENERATION NNSA FACILITIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA",
