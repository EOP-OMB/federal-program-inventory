THESE LANDOWNERS (HAVING LANDHOLDING OF ~20 ACRES AND BELOW) GENERALLY DO NOT REALIZE THE FULL BENEFIT OF THEIR LANDS AND THEREFORE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH LARGE-SCALE FARMS AND WOOD LANDOWNERS. USING OUR CURRENT FIVE-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN BY AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCE UNIT AT NCAT (I.E. MISSION POSSIBLE), OUR PROGRAM IS GEARED AT PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO GUIDE AND MOTIVATE THESE SMALL-SCALE, LIMITED RESOURCES AND SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND WOODLAND OWNERS TO MAKE MORE SUSTAINABLE DECISIONS. IT WILL NOT ONLY IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS BUT ALSO IMPROVE OVERALL LIFESTYLE WHILE GENERATING LONG-TERM STEWARDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES TOWARDS MANAGING SOIL, WATER, AGRICULTURAL, AND FOREST LAND WILL REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINTS. OUR PROGRAM WILL IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: I) BUILD A VERY STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO IDENTIFY CLUSTERS OF LANDOWNERS (YOUTH, ADULT, NEW, BEGINNING, AND VETERANS) INTERESTED IN REALIZING THE FULL BENEFIT OF THEIR LANDS; II) CONDUCT IN- SERVICE TRAINING (~TRAIN THE TRAINER TYPE) WITH OUR COUNTY AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES EXTENSION AGENTS AND OTHER PARAPROFESSIONALS INTERESTED IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES-RELATED OPERATIONS (I.E. SOI, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY) AND ALSO, LAND-LOSS ISSUES; AND III) ASSIST SMALL-SCALE GROWERS AND LANDOWNERS TO APPLY AND COMPLETE COST-SHARE APPLICATIONS FROM THE USDA AND ALSO, APPLY FOR EXISTING GOVERNMENT LOANS AND GRANTS RELATEDTO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. USING THE EXISTING EDUCATIONAL TRAINING MATERIALS THROUGH THE TRAIN-THE-TRAINER MODEL, THIS PROJECT INTENDS TO TRAIN COUNTY EXTENSION AGENTS, SMALL-SCALE FARMERS, WOODLAND, AND OTHER LANDOWNERS WITH AGRICULTURE, NATURAL RESOURCES, AND AGROFORESTRY SKILLS AND THEIR PROPERTY BASICS TO STEM THE LAND LOSS.

THE VSU RREA 2023 PROGRAM WILL BUILD ON THIS APPROACH BY CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMS, WORKSHOPS, AND DEMONSTRATIONS ABOUT PRODUCTION OF NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS, AS IN THE PAST, AND ALSO INCLUDING DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ABOUT MANAGEMENT FOR TIMBER ON SMALL WOODLOTS AND ABOUT AGROFORESTRY AND NON-TIMBER SYSTEMS. SMALL WOODLOT MANAGEMENT AND MARKETING PROGRAMS WILL LARGELY FOCUS ON FORESTRY BASICS, INCLUDING PLANNING, SELLING TIMBER, AND BASIC SILVICULTURE. WITH REGARDS TO ALTERNATIVE FOREST PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON GETTING LANDOWNERS THE MOST RELEVANT INFORMATION, AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO INNOVATE AND EXPLORE. GOALS / OBJECTIVES THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO ENHANCE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND ENHANCE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT THAT WILL ADDRESS THE CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, FOREST FOOD SAFETY AND SECURITY AND URBANIZATION. THE RREA-SUPPORTED PROGRAM WILL ALSO BUILD ON INTEREST IN LONGLEAF AND SHORTLEAF PINE BY HELPING LANDOWNERS EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF GOOD TIMBER QUALITY AND NTFPS. IN ADDITION, THERE WILL BE COLLABORATION WITH OTHER AREAS OF EXTENSION, SUCH AS HELPING LANDOWNERS DEVELOP MARKETING PLANS, FINANCIAL LITERACY TRAINING FOR FOREST LANDOWNERS, AND ESTATE PLANNING. THESE AREAS IMPACT THE ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY OF FORESTLANDS. COMPONENTS 1 - MARKETING AND ALTERNATIVE FOREST PRODUCTION SYSTEMS: A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE IS STANDING IN SMALL AREAS ON THE PROPERTIES OF PRIVATE LANDHOLDERS IN VIRGINIA (ROSE 2009). ALSO, 58% OF LIMITED-RESOURCE FARMERS OWN WOODLOTS, WITH AN AVERAGE SIZE OF 55 ACRES (USDA 2007). IF THESE FORESTLANDS CANNOT PROVIDE ECONOMIC BENEFITS, LANDOWNERS WILL BE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED, AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE MAY LOSE AN IMPORTANT RENEWABLE RESOURCE IF FORESTS ARE CONVERTED TO OTHER LAND USES. PRODUCTION AND SALE OF TIMBER IS AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR LANDOWNERS; HOWEVER, SMALL AND LIMITED-RESOURCE LANDOWNERS ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE: (1) TIMBER DOES NOT HELP SMALL AND LIMITED-RESOURCE LANDOWNERS MEET YEARLY CASH NEEDS; (2) THERE IS A LARGE INFORMATION GAP BETWEEN MOST LANDOWNERS AND FOREST INDUSTRY WORKERS; AND (3) ECONOMIES OF SCALE CAN MAKE LOGGING FOR SOME TIMBER PRODUCTS ON SMALL TRACTS UNECONOMICAL. COMPONENT 2 - URBAN FORESTRY: A MAJOR NEW EMPHASIS IN VSU\u2019S RREA PROGRAM WILL BE URBAN FORESTRY. URBAN FOREST MANAGEMENT CAN HELP MEET URGENT NEEDS IN THE US, AND THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA. FOR INSTANCE, WELL-SELECTED AND WELL-PLACED TREES AND OTHER PERENNIAL VEGETATION CAN: REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND COSTS FROM HEATING AND COOLING BUILDINGS, THEREBY PROMOTING ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND A REDUCED CARBON FOOTPRINT; ENCOURAGE HEALTHY OUTDOOR LIVING HABITS; IMPROVE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT THEREBY REDUCING COSTS OF STORMWATER ENGINEERING AND POTENTIALLY IMPROVING WATER QUALITY IN THE IMPAIRED CHESAPEAKE BAY; PROVIDE BIOREMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SOILS/GROUNDWATER IN URBAN BROWNFIELD SITES; AND CAPTURE CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE (BOLUND AND HUNHAMMAR 1999). THE VSU RREA PROGRAM WILL COMPLEMENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH AND TEACHING PROGRAMS IN URBAN FORESTRY AT VSU. THE PURPOSE OF THE EXTENSION COMPONENT WILL BE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF TREES. VSU OUTCOMES: COMPONENT 1. ALTERNATIVE FOREST PRODUCTION SYSTEMS: DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC RETURNS FROM NON-TRADITIONAL FOREST-BASED SYSTEMS, SUCH AS AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS (INCLUDING SI LVOPASTURE AND FOREST FARMING OF NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS). SUPPORT NIPF LANDOWNERS TO INNOVATE NON-TRADITIONAL FOREST-BASED SYSTEMS. OUTCOME TARGET 2.1: DEMONSTRATION PRODUCTS AT RESEARCH STATION AND PRIVATE LANDHOLDINGS ARE SHOWN TO BE FINANCIALLY VIABLE, THROUGH MEASUREMENT OF REAL-WORLD COSTS AND REVENUES. OUTCOME TARGET 2.2: AT LEAST 100 LANDOWNERS IN VIRGINIA ESTABLISH AT LEAST ONE NEW ALTERNATIVE FOREST PRODUCTION ENTERPRISE. OUTCOME TARGET 2.3: AT LEAST 20 LANDOWNERS EXPERIMENT WITH INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AS A RESULT OF CONCEPTS LEARNED AND CONTACTS MADE. COMPONENT 2. URBAN FOREST MANAGEMENT: INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY TREES. AID COMMUNITIES IN DEVELOPMENT OF URBAN/COMMUNITY FOREST MANAGEMENT PLANS. OUTCOME TARGET 3.1: PARTICIPANTS IN RREA-SUPPORTED EVENTS INCREASE AWARENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES RELATIVE TO THEIR BASELINE KN OWLEDGE. OUTCOME TARGET 3.2: AT LEAST TWO COMMUNITIES ADOPT OR IMPROVE URBAN/COMMUNITY FOREST MANAGEMENT PLANS. PROJECT DELIVERY METHOD VIRGINIA STATE UNIVERSITY IS ACTIVELY BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING ITS PROGRAM FOR FORESTRY EXTENSION. THIS PROGRAM BUILDS ON TRADITIONAL (E.G., NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS; SERVING SMALL AND LIMITED-RESOURCE LANDOWNERS) AND EMERGING (E.G., URBAN HORTICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE) AREAS OF FOCUS FOR VSU. VSU\u2019S AND RREA-SUPPORTED PROGRAMS WILL PRIMARILY BE MARKETED TO UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS - SMALL AND LIMITED-RESOURCE LANDOWNERS, AS WELL AS MINORITY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. VSU TRADITIONALLY HAS HAD THE LARGEST IMPACT BY DIRECTLY TARGETING THOSE COMMUNITIES. VSU FORESTRY EXTENSION WILL WORK IN COORDINATION WITH THE VSU SMALL FARM OUTREACH PROGRAM TO REACH OUT TO THESE STAKEHOLDERS. FURTHERMORE, AN ONGOING SURVEY FUNDED BY MCINTIRE-STENNIS FUNDS WILL HELP IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE NEVER HAD CONTACT WITH VCE IN THE PAST. WHILE VSU CAN HELP THE EXISTING FORESTRY EXTENSION PROGRAMS TO REACH NEW AUDIENCES, IT IS NOT THE INTENT OF VCE/VSU TO EXCLUDE OTHER INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS. VIRGINIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION IS A SINGLE INSTITUTION, AND VSU AND VIRGINIA TECH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO COMPLEMENT EFFORTS TO CREATE SYNERGIES. FURTHERMORE, VSU WILL WORK WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO IDENTIFY COMMON FOCUS AREAS AND NEEDS IN VIRGINIA. AREAS THAT ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING ATTENTION FROM NUMEROUS VIRGINIA ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDE RESTORATION OF SHORTLEAF AND LONGLEAF PINE, AND WATER QUALITY IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY. EMERGING THEMES OF INTEREST IN VIRGINIA INCLUDE BIOENERGY AND MARKETS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR VSU TO STAY ABREAST OF THESE THEMES AND INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE THREE COMPONENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE BECAUSE THEY CAN HELP VSU COOPERATE WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS, AND CAPTURE GREATER PUBLIC INTEREST. MONITORING AND EVALUATION: MONITORING AND EVALUATION ARE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT AND IMPROVE PROGRAMS AND TO ENSURE LONG-TERM SUCCESS. WE INTEND TO MEASURE AND MONITOR THE OUTPUT AND OUTCOME TARGETS DESCRIBED ABOVE. OUTPUTS ARE MOST EASILY MEASURED: THEY CAN BE QUANTIFIED IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS, NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS, ETC. OUTCOMES, HOWEVER, IMPLY A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR BY THE AUDIENCE, AND CAN BE SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE. EACH DELIVERY METHOD NECESSITATES DIFFERENT OUTCOME MONITORING AND EVALUATIONTOOLS, SOME OF WHICH REQUIRE SPECIFIC FUNDING. (A) DEM ONSTRATION SITES WILL HAVE LOGBOOKS FOR VISITOR INFORMATION AND SUGGESTIONS (COUNTS OF VISITORS MEASURE OUTPUT). (B) COSTS AND REVENUES OF DEMONSTRATION SITES WILL BE LOGGED TO ESTIMATE FINANCIAL RETURNS. (C) IN-EVENT QUESTIONNAIRES AND OCCASIONAL POST-EVENT SURVEYS.

SUSTAINABILITY NEEDS OF THE OWNER AND SOCIETY. TOPICAL ISSUES INCLUDE: LANDOWNER ENGAGEMENT; PUBLIC AWARENESS AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT; INVASIVE SPECIES; WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT; RURAL COMMUNITIES; WATER AND WETLANDS; GENERATIONAL SUCCESSION AND OTHER LAND-OWNERSHIP CHANGES; FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT; AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. WSUS RREA PROGRAM IS ALIGNED WITH THE USDA STRATEGIC GOAL #1, TO \u201cCOMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE TO SUPPORT AMERICA\u2019S WORKING LANDS, NATURAL RESOURCES AND COMMUNITIES.\u201d OF THE TOPICS WE ADDRESS, WE FOCUS ON THE RREA GOAL ENHANCING RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON WORKING FORESTS AND RANGELANDS. OUR ISSUES AREAS ARE 1) FOREST STEWARDSHIP AND HEALTH, AND 2) RANGELAND STEWARDSHIP AND HEALTH. OUR FOCUS IS WATERSHED PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF FOREST AND RANGE FIRES, AND THE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY OF FOREST AND RANGE RESOURCES. ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED THE WSU EXTENSION FORESTRY <(>&<)> RANGE TEAM WILL PROVIDE THE UNBIASED, RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF LANDOWNERS AND SOCIETY. THROUGH FACE-TO-FACE AND ONLINE DELIVERIES OF CLASSES, FIELD DAYS, WORKSHOPS, SEMINARS, CONFERENCES, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SHORT COURSES, RECRUITMENT, TRAININGS, CONSULTATIONS, MEDIA WORK, AND EDUCATIONAL COUNSELING AND FACILITATION, LANDOWNERS WILL IMPROVE LEARNING AND APPLICATION OF NEW IDEAS THAT WILL LEAD TO DESIRABLE FUTURE CONDITIONS. THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE PROVIDED BOTH LIVE AND PRE-RECORDED, TO SUIT PREFERENCE AND CONVENIENCE FOR LANDOWNERS TO ACCESS NEEDED INFORMATION. WHEN NECESSARY, INFORMATION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE IN SPANISH FOR THOSE WITH ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE. PHYSICAL ACCESS AND DISABILITIES WILL BE INQUIRED ABOUT FOLLOWED BY ADA STANDARDS. DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES WSU EXPECTS TO DELIVER 100 ACTIVITIES (DESCRIBED ABOVE) REACHING 10,000 OWNERS AND MANAGERS AND POSITIVELY IMPACTING THE CONDITION OF \u00bd-MILLION ACRES OF FOREST AND RANGELAND. COMPREHENSIVE ACHIEVEMENTS WILL 1) TO ENHANCE FOREST AND RANGE SUSTAINABILITY BY DEVELOPING OWNER/ MANAGER CAPACITIES TO IMPROVE VIGOR AND PRODUCTIVITY; 2) PROMOTE FOREST AND RANGE LAND RESILIENCE BY PREPARING OWNER/ MANAGER CAPACITIES TO RESPOND TO THE ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC IMPACTS CAUSED BY WILDFIRE, DROUGHT, WILDLIFE DAMAGE, INVASIVE SPECIES, HARMFUL INSECTS AND DISEASE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS PERPETUATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE; AND 3) DIVERSITY FOREST AND RANGE LANDOWNERS/ MANAGERS STEWARDSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THAT LEAD TO MULTIPLE-USE BENEFITS. WE BASE THESE EXPECTATIONS ON ACCOMPLISHMENTS DERIVED BY THE PAST 15 YEARS OF PROGRAM EVALUATION DATA. THESE DATA REVEALED THAT LANDOWNERS AND MANAGERS ENGAGED IN IN LEARNING-- CREATING AWARENESS AND CHANGES IN ATTITUDE, IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS, AND MOTIVATED THE APPLICATION AND/OR THE TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY TO PRACTICES  ON THE GROUND. WE EXPECT BEST PRACTICE DECISIONS AND BEHAVIORS EXECUTED WILL LEAD TO COMPREHENSIVE ACHIEVEMENTS AND IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND ADD VALUE TO NATURAL RESOURCE CONDITIONS AND PRODUCTS. NOTEWORTHY IMPACTS WE EXPECT WILL: 1) IMPROVED FOREST <(>&<)> RANGELAND HEALTH; 2) DECREASE RISK FROM WILDFIRE; 3) IMPROVE HABITAT; 4) DECREASE RISKS FROM INSECT OR DISEASE; 5) IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY FOR GROWING TREES AND FORAGE; 6) DECREASE RISK OF EROSION; 7) INCREASE FORAGE AND TREE COVER; 8) IMPROVE WOOD QUALITY; 9) IMPROVE INCOME OPPORTUNITY; 10) IMPROVE IDENTIFICATION AND PROTECTION OF CULTURAL RESOURCES AND SPECIAL SITES; 11) IMPROVE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES; AND 12) DECREASE NOXIOUS WEEDS/ INVASIVE SPECIES. INDICATORS OF LEARNING (SHORT-TERM CHANGES) WILL BE ASSESSMENTS OF AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE, AND SKILLS. WE WILL NOT SEEK INFORMATION REGARDING MANAGEMENT OPINIONS, ASPIRATIONS,OR MOTIVATIONS, THOUGH WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE SOMETIMES USED FOR EVALUATION METRICS. INSTEAD, WE SEEK TO MEASURE CHANGES IN OWNER/MANAGER BEHAVIORS, PRACTICES, AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, DECISIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, ASKING FOR A FORESTER VISIT, OR, APPLYING FOR COST-SHARE ASSISTANCE TO IMPLEMENT A PLANNING CONTRACT). WSU WILL DISSEMINATE INFORMATION VIA PERSONAL CONNECTIONS AND AFFILIATIONS, PARTNER NETWORKS, AND THROUGH STAFF EMAIL LISTS. WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN AGROFORESTRY ROUNDTABLE AND OTHER FORUMS THAT ENGAGE WSU WITH TRIBAL CONNECTIONS THROUGH THE EXTENSION SERVICE AND THROUGH TRIBAL NATURAL RESOURCE PROGRAMS. WE WILL CREATE ONLINE VIDEO CONTENT, CREATE POPULAR NEWSLETTERS AND RELEVANT MEDIA, AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY PRESS. MANY VIDEOS WILL BE HOSTED ON YOUTUBE AND INDEXED ON OUR WEBSITE. OTHER VECTORS OF DISSEMINATION WILL INCLUDE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (TWITTER, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM). PROGRAMS AND PUBLICATIONS WILL BE IDENTIFIABLE FOR BOTH ACCESSIBILITIES, AND FOR BILINGUAL AVAILABILITY WHERE WE SEE MOST FIT (SPANISH VERSION WHERE USER IS EXPECTED TO SPEAK SPANISH AS A FIRST LANGUAGE). WE WILL LEVERAGE OUR OUTREACH BY UTILIZING PARTNERSHIPS SUCH AS THE WA ASSOCIATION OF CONSERVATION ASSOCIATIONS, WA FARM FORESTRY ASSOCIATION, WA SOCIETY OF AMERICAN FORESTERS, INLAND EMPIRE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN FORESTERS, FORESTRY COLLABORATIVES, AND COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS. WE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO NGO PURPOSES THAT HOLD COMMON CONSERVATION GOALS FOR INFORMING THEIR MEMBERSHIP AND THE PUBLIC, SUCH AS THE NATURE CONSERVANCY, AMERICAN TREE FARM SYSTEM, AMERICAN FOREST FOUNDATIONS, ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK FOUNDATION, AND VARIOUS LAND TRUSTS. WE WILL CAPTURE BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT CONTACTS FOR EVALUATION AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OUR RREA PROGRAM TARGETS NON-INDUSTRIAL PRIVATE LANDOWNERS (NIPF) AND PROFESSIONAL NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGERS (PRACTICING FORESTERS, LOGGERS, RANCHERS, SILVICULTURAL CONTRACTORS, AND TRIBAL NATURAL RESOURCE EMPLOYEES). WASHINGTON HAS 215,000 NIPF OWNERS THAT CONTROL 5.8 MILLION ACRES OF FORESTLAND, MAKING THIS THE LARGEST RURAL LAND USE GROUP IN THE STATE. ANOTHER 4.0 MILLION ACRES OF PRIVATE LAND IS GRAZED AS EITHER OPEN AND FORESTED OR TRANSITORY GRASS/ CROPLAND. MOST LANDOWNERS MANAGE FOR MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS PRODUCTIVE TIMBER AND RANGE LAND, WILDLIFE HABITAT, AND RECREATION. HOWEVER, MOST NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS AGREE THAT MOST LANDOWNERS LACK THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR PERSONAL OBJECTIVES. THIS JEOPARDIZES THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE LAND, THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF THE LANDOWNER, AND THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES SUCH AS WATER, AIR, AND WILDLIFE. MOST LANDOWNERS LACK A WRITTEN MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH PROVIDES THE BIOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, AND POLITICAL INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE SOUND DECISIONS TO EXECUTE BEST PRACTICES IN A LOGICAL AND FEASIBLE MANNER. FOREST AND RANGE OWNERS NEED A SURROUND-SOUND APPROACH OF EDUCATIONAL DELIVERIES OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATIONTO PROTECT THEIR VALUES WITHOUT COMPROMISING THOSE AMENITY AND COMMODITY FOREST AND RANGE VALUES FOR THEMSELVES, SOCIETY, AND FUTURE FOR GENERATIONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "947e1206-493b-234a-ae92-ccd4d15bae0b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23RREAFXXXG063_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736067, "Award ID": "NI23RREAFXXXG062", "Award Amount": 13500.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.515", "Description": "THE WV STATE UNIVERSITY RENEWABLE RESOURCES EXTENSION ACT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE BASIC INFORMATION TO THE CITIZENS OF WEST VIRGINIA THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO BE STEWARDS OF OUR STATE\u2019S NATURAL RESOURCES.

AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES: AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY UTAH HAS OVER 18,000 FARMS AND RANCHES SPANNING 11 MILLION ACRES, WHICH GENERATE MORE THAN $21 BILLION IN TOTAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT). WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT UTAH BECOMES MORE URBANIZED EACH YEAR, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO PLAY A VITAL PART IN OUR STATE. AS THE POPULATION OF UTAH AND THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO GROW, FOOD PRODUCTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY (USU) EXTENSION HAS LED THE WAY FOR 105 YEARS IN PROVIDING NON-BIASED, RESEARCH-BASED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PRODUCERS AND THE UTAH AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. USU EXTENSION HAS NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FACULTY WITH EXPERTISE IN ALL AREAS OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION AND SCIENCE. OUR ON-CAMPUS AND COUNTY FACULTY CONDUCT CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH THAT IS DISSEMINATED TO PRODUCERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH METHODS SUCH AS FIELD DAYS, WORKSHOPS, PRINTED AND ONLINE PUBLICATIONS, CLASSES, ONLINE COURSES, AND SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS. EXTENSION CONTINUES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE WHILE EVOLVING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DEVELOPING AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES. AS WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON PERSISTENT AND EMERGING NEEDS, WE RECOGNIZE UTAH IS THE SECOND DRIEST STATE IN THE NATION, SO IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY, WATER CONSERVATION, AND IMPROVED WATER-EFFICIENT CROP VARIETIES CONTINUE TO BE FOCUS AREAS FOR OUR FACULTY AND RESEARCHERS. WITH URBAN AND SMALL FARMS BECOMING MORE POPULAR, EXTENSION FACULTY ARE WORKING WITH PRODUCERS TO FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO PRODUCE FOOD ON MINIMAL ACREAGE. THE LONG-TERM GOALS OF THE AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCE (AG/NR) PROGRAM ARE TO (A) INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY OF UTAH AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS, AND (B) PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE USE THROUGH RELEVANT EDUCATION ON CONSERVATION PRACTICES. FACULTY INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING CROP AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION, RANGELAND MANAGEMENT, FORESTRY, AND AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS. ALL RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES THE WESTERN U.S. CONTAINS STATES WITH VAST TRACTS OF PUBLIC LAND SURROUNDING SMALLER AREAS THAT ARE PRIVATELY OWNED, MOSTLY ADJACENT TO WATER. THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASE OF ANY ECONOMY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMIC AND AESTHETIC ENVIRONMENTS FOR THAT AREA. CHANGES IN THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASE BRING VARIATION IN THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE. CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING NATURAL RESOURCE CHARACTERISTICS ARE FOUND IN SOILS, WATER, RANGE, FOREST, ANIMALS, AND AIR RESOURCES. THE PROPER AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS A PRIMARY CONCERN, PARTICULARLY FOR ENVIRONMENTS AS VARIED AND UNIQUE AS IN THE WEST. THIS CRITICAL ISSUE INVOLVES IMPROVING DECISION-MAKING RELATIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IN AN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND BIOLOGICAL SENSE. USU EXTENSION ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES THROUGH THE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM. THE GOAL OF THIS EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE NON-FORMAL EDUCATION TO RESIDENTS, STAKEHOLDERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE, FACILITATE, AND STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIPAND SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE USE IN UTAH. THIS PROJECT PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON FOREST MANAGEMENT, WATER CONSERVATION, AND STEWARDSHIP OF PUBLIC LANDS. THE PROJECT TARGETS ADULTS AND YOUTH, AND THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO (A) EQUIP RESIDENTS WITH THE COMPETENCY TO EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE IN NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION, AND (B) FACILITATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS TO STRENGTHEN NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND ENABLE SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE. FACULTY INVOLVED IN THE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING WATER MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES, AND TOURISM. ALL RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, DEMONSTRATIONS, CONFERENCES, AND FIELD VISITS ON TOPICS RELATED TO WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY, CLIMATE SCIENCE, BIOMASS, PERMACULTURE, OUTDOOR RECREATION, AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION. FOOD SAFETY WITH A LARGE VARIETY OF FOOD PRODUCTS MOVING THROUGH COMPLEX DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, FOOD SAFETY IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR PRODUCERS, PR OCESSORS, DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, AND THE FINAL CONSUMER. FOODBORNE ILLNESS IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH, CLAIMING THE LIVES OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS; THE ELDERLY, YOUNG, PREGNANT WOMEN, PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRED IMMUNE FUNCTION, AND THE CHRONICALLY ILL. IMPROPER FOOD HANDLING AND PREPARATION OF FOOD IN FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE HOME CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD-BORNE ILLNESSES. THE PUBLIC FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION AIMS TO PROVIDE RELEVANT RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATION TO UTAH RESIDENTS ON BEST PRACTICES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FOOD CONTAMINATION AND FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. THE MAJOR FOCUS AREAS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE FOOD PRESERVATION TECHNIQUES AND HOUSEHOLD FOOD STORAGE. THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE PUBLIC FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION PROGRAM ARE TO (A) REDUCE THE OCCURRENCES OF FOODBORNE ILLNESSES IN UTAH THROUGH RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATION ON FOOD SAFETY PRACTICES IN HOUSEHOLDS, AND (B) TO REDUCE FOOD CONTAMINATION IN THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN BY PROVIDING RELEVANT EDUCATION ON BEST PRACTICES TO PROCESSORS AND PRODUCERS. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN FOOD SAFETY INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, CONSULTATIONS, AND (VIRTUAL AND FACE-TO-FACE) DEMONSTRATIONS TARGETED AT RESIDENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES ON FOOD PRESERVATION, CANNING, PRESSURE TESTING, FOOD PRODUCT TESTING, AND FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. NUTRITION AND HEALTH THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE NUTRITION INFORMATION AND EDUCATION TO THE PUBLIC TO ENABLE CONSUMERS TO MAKE WISE DIETARY CHOICES. AS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIET, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, AND DISEASE PREVENTION BECOME CLEARER, THE PROMOTION OF HEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS AND LIFESTYLES FOR BOTH YOUTH AND ADULTS HAS RECEIVED INCREASED ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. WITH HIGH LEVELS OF OBESITY, CHRONIC DISEASE, AND POOR DIETARY HABITS, THERE IS A NEED FOR NON-FORMAL NUTRITION EDUCATION THAT ADDRESSES INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY HEALTH AND WELLNESS. THE PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION SEEKS TO DECREASE THE INCIDENCES OF CHRONIC DISEASES AND OTHER NUTRITION-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES AMONG RESIDENTS THROUGH NON-FORMAL NUTRITION EDUCATION. THE PRIORITIES FOR THIS PROGRAM ARE TO EXPAND NUTRITIONAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, AND TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETARY HABITS. THEREFORE, THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE THE PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM ARE TO (A) EMPOWER RESIDENTS TO MAKE HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES AND IMPROVE THEIR NUTRITIONAL INTAKE, AND (B) REDUCE THE ECONOMIC COST OF CHRONIC DISEASES IN UTAH THROUGH ONGOING NUTRITION EDUCATION TO YOUTH AND ADULTS. FACULTY INVOLVED IN PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING N UTRITION, OBESITY, CHRONIC DISEASES, AND FOOD SCIENCE. RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN NUTRITION AND HEALTH INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND CONSULTATIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO CHRONIC DISEASES, NUTRITION EDUCATION, HEALTHY AND AFFORDABLE RECIPES, DIET BEHAVIOR CHANGES, AND YOUTH NUTRITION. COMMUNITY RESILIENCE UTAH CONSISTS OF MANY RURAL COUNTIES SPREAD OUT OVER VAST AREAS OF LAND, AND ONLY A FEW URBAN COUNTIES IN CENTRALIZED LOCATIONS. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN INCREASING DISPARITY IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS IN RURAL COUNTIES. THE MAJORITY OF CURRENT AND NEW JOBS ARE LOCATED ALONG THE URBAN COUNTIES IN THE WASATCH FRONT, INCLUDING JOBS IN THE GROWING TECHNOLOGY SECTOR IN UTAH'S \"SILICON SLOPES.\" IN CONTRAST, RURAL RESIDENTS STRUGGLE TO FIND WELL-PAYING AND STABLE WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ARE OFTEN FACED WITH THE DECISION TO RELOCATE TO URBAN CENTERS. THIS EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC DEPRESSION IN RURAL COUNTIES SINCE RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION LEADS TO LOW PRODUCTIVITY IN THESE COUNTIES. THERE IS A NEED TO SUPPORT RURAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH COMMUNITY AND CAPACITY-BUILDING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION TO ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS, INDIVIDUALS IN RURAL COUNTIES SUFFER FROM RELATIVELY HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. THE RATES OF OPIOID OVERDOSES IN RURAL UTAH HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. UTAH HAD EIGHT (8) OUT OF 10 ADULT OVERDOSE DEATHS EACH WEEK DUE TO OPIOIDS IN 2019, AND HALF OF THOSE WERE SPECIFICALLY DUE TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS (UTAH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH [UDOH] INDICATOR-BASED SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH [IBIS], 2021). IN 2020, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CREATED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING INCREASES IN OPIOID-RELATED DEATHS DUE TO FENTANYL. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION IS TO STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES ACROSS UTAH THROUGH FACILITATED COMMUNITY-FOCUSED COALITIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS, ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION, AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES PROGRAM ARE TO (A) CONNECT RURAL COMMUNITIES TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN URBAN CENTERS THROUGH INNOVATIVE WORKPLACE PRACTICES (E.G., REMOTE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS), AND (B) FACILITATE EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS, AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COALITIONS TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS IN RURAL COUNTIES. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN COMMUNITY RESILIENCE INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND INTERVENTIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, RURAL EMPLOYMENT, REMOTE WORKING, BUILDING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COALITIONS, AND TRIBAL INITIATIVES. INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT UTAH IS IN THE TOP 5 U.S. STATES WITH BANKRUPTCY, AND THERE IS A NEED FOR OUTREACH EDUCATION TO FACILITATE IMPROVED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. BECAUSE OF UTAH'S TYPICALLY LARGER FAMILY SIZE, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME AVAILABLE FOR BASIC FAMILY NEEDS SLIPS BELOW THE MEAN FOR THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. UTAH FAMILIES ALREADY FACE HIGH DEBT LOADS LEADING TO BANKRUPTCY, LOW SAVINGS, AND A LACK OF LIQUID ASSETS. HENCE, THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PLANNED EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO ENHANCE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (FRM). FRM, WHICH RELATES TO FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, ALSO TIES TO OTHER ASPECTS OF FAMILY HEALTH, SUCH AS HEALTHY MARITAL AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. AS A BROAD PROGRAM AREA, THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES YOUTH, ADULTS, AND FAMILIES IN UTAH. DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO; (A) STRENGTHEN FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND (B) IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. FACULTY INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCT RESEARCH IN FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING, RELATIONSHIPS, AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THE RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN COMMUNITY RESILIENCE INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, CONFERENCES, AND CONSULTATIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, HOMEOWNER AND HOMEBUYER EDUCATION, FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, COUPLES, AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND MENTAL WELLNESS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d345a8ea-b0ac-7e5d-b949-6507917f2140-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23RREAFXXXG060_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735911, "Award ID": "NI23RREAFXXXG059", "Award Amount": 13500.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.515", "Description": "RENEWABLE RESOURCES EXTENSION ACT PROGRAM TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY HOLDS A HISTORIC CONNECTION TO LANDOWNERS IN THE BLACK BELT OF ALABAMA, AS WELL AS ACROSS THE STATE FOR PROVIDING SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR LAND MANAGEMENT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY.

WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH MANY PRIVATE AND PUBLIC AGENCIES AND LEVERAGE RREA DOLLARS AGAINST OTHER FUNDING TO MAXIMIZE PROGRAM IMPACT AND REACH. FORESTS PROVIDE A MULTITUDE OF ENVIRONMENTAL (E.G., CARBON SEQUESTRATION, ENHANCED WATER QUALITY, WILDLIFE HABITAT), ECONOMIC (E.G., TIMBER, WOOD PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING, TOURISM), AND SOCIAL (E.G., RECREATION, AESTHETICS) BENEFITS TO SOCIETY. IN INDIANA, 86 PERCENT OF THE 4.65 MILLION ACRES OF FORESTLAND IS PRIVATELY OWNED BY AN ESTIMATED 180,000 PRIVATE LANDOWNERS. MAINTAINING THE MANY BENEFITS THAT WORKING FORESTS PROVIDE ALL CITIZENS OF INDIANA IS DEPENDENT UPON THE LAND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS MADEBY FOREST LANDOWNERS AND THE PROFESSIONALS WHO ADVISE THEM. THE RREA PROGRAM IN INDIANA WILL UTILIZE DEMONSTRATION FORESTS AND ONLINE RESOURCES TO TRAIN PRIVATE WOODLAND OWNERS AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS, FOCUSING ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STEWARDSHIP PRACTICES AND PLANS THAT RESULT IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS. THESE BENEFITS ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN THREE MAJOR PROGRAMS.

ON SEPTEMBER OF 2022, THE ISLAND WAS IMPACTED AGAIN BY HURRICANE FIONA, WITH 85 MILES PER HOUR WINDS AND 30-60 INCHES OF RAIN. AGAIN, THE FORESTS AND URBAN FORESTS TREES WERE DAMAGED BY THE WINDS OR BY THE LANDSLIDES. THESE EVENTS ALSO CREATE ANOTHER PROBLEM, WHICH IS THE DAMAGE FALLING TREES CAN CAUSE TO INFRASTRUCTURE, LIKE ELECTRICITY AND COMMUNICATIONS LINES, TO BUILDINGS AND TO HOUSES AND CARS. AND, AS CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS THE PLANET, FOR PUERTO RICO THE EFFECTS INCLUDE AN INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF EXTREME EVENTS AND, THOSE WILL HAVE AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF RAIN (WATER ENVIRONMENT FEDERATION, 2021). FOR THIS, IT IS NECESSARY TO EDUCATE THE PUERTO RICO AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SERVICE (PRAES) AGRICULTURAL AGENTS IN TOPICS RELATED TO GREEN SPACES EMERGENCY PLAN PREPARATION, DAMAGE EVALUATION, TREES PRUNING AND PROTECTION, AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR TREE SELECTION IN URBAN AREAS. THIS CAN BE DELIVERED AS A SHORT COURSE, THAT THEY CAN THEN OFFER TO THE COMMUNITY LEADERS.

SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF THIS RESOURCE IS PUBLICLY OWNED, WITH STATE AGENCIES MANAGING OVER 600,000 ACRES. THE REMAINING HALF (APPROXIMATE) OF THE RESOURCE CAN BE GENERALIZED AS BEING IN PRIVATE MANAGEMENT ABOUT 348,000 ACRES ARE CONSIDERED FAMILY FORESTED LAND, WITH 83% OF THOSE FAMILIES OWNING 10-49 ACRES. WITHIN THAT AREA, OVER 52,500 ACRES ARE CERTIFIED UNDER THE AMERICAN TREE FARM SYSTEM, AND APPROXIMATELY 15,500 ACRES ARE CERTIFIED UNDER THE FOREST STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THESE FOREST OWNERS IS ESTIMATED TO BE 60 YEARS, WITH 44% OVER 65. CONCURRENTLY, THE AGE OF FOREST STANDS IS INCREASING, SUGGESTING PROFOUND TRANSITIONS IN OWNERSHIP, MANAGEMENT, AND REGENERATION CHALLENGES OF FOREST SPECIES, ESPECIALLY IN AN AGE OF RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES FROM CLIMATE AND NOVEL DISEASE-PEST PRESSURES.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO INFORM, INCREASE AND SUPPORT ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE STATE\u2019S TREE CANOPY AND FORESTED RESOURCES ON PRIVATE NON-INDUSTRIAL FOREST LANDS, MUNICIPALLY MANAGED LANDS, URBAN/SUBURBAN CANOPY AND STATE FORESTED LANDS TO INCREASE RETURNS AND BENEFITS TO THE LANDOWNER. IN SO DOING, THE GOAL IS TO ENHANCE THE RESOURCE, AND ULTIMATELY RETAIN NEW JERSEY'S FOREST RESOURCE AND COMMUNITY TREE CANOPY IN A HEALTHY, PRODUCTIVE STATE. METHODS FOR ATTAINING THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE EVENING SEMINARS, PRESENCE AT FIELD DAYS, AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO PROFESSIONAL AND VOLUNTEER TRAINING CONFERENCES. WE WILL DEVELOP PROGRAMMING WITH AN EYE TO DIGITAL PLATFORMS TO AUGMENT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF FOREST MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PRODUCTS. THE PROGRAM SPECIFICS WILL LINK TO THE 2020 NJ DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOREST ACTION PLAN AND THE PLANNED REVISIONS TO THE NJ STATE FORESTRY BMP MANUAL.

THEY WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND COLLABORATIVELY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS IN ALL 95 COUNTIES AND TO SERVE THE STATES 6.9 MILLION PEOPLE. THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE IS BASED IN KNOXVILLE AND SERVES AS THE STATES 1862 INSTITUTION. IT INCLUDES THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT EXTENSION) AND THE TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (UT AGRESEARCH). BASED IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY (TSU) IS THE STATES 1890 INSTITUTION; IT INCLUDES THE TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. THIS PLAN OF WORK REPRESENTS THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF UT EXTENSION, UT AGRESEARCH, TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM, AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. AGRICULTURE IS INTEGRAL TO TENNESSEES ECONOMY AND CULTURE. ALMOST ONE OF EVERY EIGHT TO NINE DOLLARS GENERATED IN THE STATE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE OR AN INDUSTRY THAT GENERATES PRODUCTS FROM A NATURAL RESOURCE  MORE THAN $79.3 BILLION ANNUALLY. THE STATES AGRICULTURAL AND RELATED EXPORTS TOTALED $2.2 BILLION IN 2021, UP $325 MILLION OR 17% WHEN COMPARED TO 2020. TENNESSEE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN ALL MAJOR COMMODITY CATEGORIES IN 2021. FARM RECEIPTS TOTALED $3.6 BILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 65.5% OF THIS VALUE COMING FROM CROPS AND 34.5% FROM ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC SUCCESSES OF TENNESSEE AGRICULTURE, 339,400 TENNESSEANS ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED BY AGRICULTURAL OR NATURAL RESOURCE INDUSTRIES, MAKING EFFECTIVE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS CRITICAL. TENNESSEES LANDGRANT INSTITUTIONS CONDUCT RESEARCH AND PROVIDE EXTENSION OUTREACH IN FIVE KEY AREAS TO ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THE STATE: SUPPORTING FOOD, FIBER, AND ENERGY SYSTEMS; ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; ENRICHING OUR ECONOMY; DEVELOPING OURWORKFORCE; AND STRENGTHENING OUR HEALTH. RESEARCH PROJECTS PROVIDE NEW KNOWLEDGE TO HELP STAKEHOLDERS ADDRESS ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEM. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES SHARE THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ULTIMATELY TO RESULT IN A CHANGE IN ACTION OR CONDITION. EXTENSION WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING NEEDS CITIZENS AND AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS ACROSS THE STATE. HEALTH ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE TOP CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. EXTENSION WILL STRENGTHEN HEALTH PROGRAMMING BY OFFERING THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR IMPROVING DIETARY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR LIMITED RESOURCE TENNESSEANS. EXTENSION LIVESTOCK AND FORAGE PROGRAMS STRENGTHEN OUR EXTENSION AND RESEARCH FOR THE STATES LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS, RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL WILL JOINTLY IMPLEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH IN HAY SCHOOLS, LATE GESTATION NUTRITION, MARKETING, FORAGE TESTING, AND STOCKPILED FORAGES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION HAS DEVELOPED PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN AND PROVIDE VALUEADDED OPPORTUNITIES FORPRODUCERS. THE UT CENTER FOR FARM MANAGEMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS IN 2022. THE CENTER FACILITATES EXTENSION, TEACHING, AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS ON FARM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. THE CENTER WILL FOCUS ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF TENNESSEE PRODUCERS AND ENHANCING LONG TERM PROFITABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURE ENTERPRISES. THROUGH THE CROPS PRODUCTION SYSTEMS EXTENSIONS PROVIDE DEMONSTRATION AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT BENEFITS PRODUCERS. THE CROP VARIETY TRIALS FOR CORN GRAIN, SILAGE, AND SOYBEANS AS WELL AS PRODUCER EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR CORN, SOYBEANS, COTTON, WHEAT, AND TOBACCO PRODUCTION ARE KEY AREAS. THE CONSUMER ECONOMICS PROGRAM HELPS FAMILIES INCREASE SAVINGS, DECREASE DEBT, AND FINANCIALLY PLAN. THE ON MY OWN AND 4 H WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED FOR YOUTH AND ADULTS THAT PROVIDE NEEDED SKILLS, TRAININGS, AND EXPERIENCES TO PARTICIPANTS. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OFTOP PRIORITY FOR EXTENSION. EXTENSION CONTINUES DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE AND PROVIDE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE NEXT CHAPTER PROGRAM IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND TENNESSEE 4 H. IN CREATING THIS PROGRAM, WE WANT TO CREATE AN EARLY DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT SKILLS ARE NECESSARY FOR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BOTH THEIR SECONDARY AND POSTSECONDARY PLANS. 4 H CONTINUES PROGRAMING ON HONING STEM AND CITIZENSHIP/LEADERSHIP SKILLS. UT AGRESEARCH CONDUCTS RESEARCH WITHIN ITS EIGHT ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND SEVEN PHYSICAL CENTERS, AND AT TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS (REC) LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE UNITS HELP DRIVE PLANNED RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND FACILITATE FACULTY RESEARCH PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO A DECADE OF EXCELLENCE: TEN YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR UTIA, 2018 2028, AGRESEARCH OPERATES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF ITS 2021 2024 AGRESEARCH STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN WITH THE OBJECTIVES TO BALANCE A PORTFOLIO OF INTEGRATED, INTER DISCIPLINARYPROY IN PRECISION LIVESTOCK FARMING (PLF). THE PROGRAM INCORPORATES BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL MANAGEMENT PROJEC TS THAT ULTIMATELY WILL CONTRIBUTE INFORMATION TO REFINE STRATEGIES THAT OFFER CARBON REDUCTIONS OVER TODAY\u2019S AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS. AGRESEARCH IS REALIGNING THE CAPABILITIES AT TWO OF ITS TEN REC TO FACILITATE PLF INITIATIVE. THE LITTLE RIVER ANIMAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT PLANS TO HAVE MILKING ROBOTS IN OPERATION BY LATE FALL 2022, AND THE MIDDLE TENNESSEE REC IS RETOOLING TO SUPPORT PRECISION BEEF AND POULTRY PRODUCTION RESEARCH. ALSO, EXPANDED ACTIVITY IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE WILL RESPOND TO CONCERNS OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION. THE TRANSFORMATIONAL AGRICULTURAL GENOMICS AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY PROGRAM WILL ADVANCE ANIMAL AND PLANT-BASED PRODUCTIVITY. ALTHOUGH EARLY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT, THE INITIATIVE ALREADY ENGAGES FACULTY TO ADVANCE STATE-OF-THE-ART SCIENCE TO DESIGN CROPS THAT ARE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. FINALLY, THE BIOECONOMY ADVANCEMENT INITIATIVE IS AN ESTABLISHED INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABLE FUELS, CHEMICALS, AND MATERIALS. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IS EXPANDING RESEARCH CAPABILITIES IN SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AGGRESSIVE GRAND CHALLENGE GOALS ANNOUNCED BY THE WHITE HOUSE. MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PROCESSES TENNESSEE EXTENSION PROGRAMS FUNDED BY SMITH-LEVER OR NARETPA SECTION 1444 AND 1445 REQUIRE A MERIT REVIEW PROCESS. A PANEL OF EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS, PROGRAM LEADERS AND SCHOLARS FROM FOUR STATES REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TENNESSEE EXTENSION MERIT REVIEW CRITERIA. CRITERIA INCLUDES ASSESSING NEEDS, DELIVERY METHODS, IMPLEMENTATION STEPS, EVALUATION, ENSURING DIVERSITY AND DEFINED OUTCOMES. UT AND TSU COORDINATE MERIT REVIEW PROCESSES. STATE EXTENSION SPECIALISTS PROPOSE PLANNED PROGRAMS. ALL PROPOSED PROGRAMS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY A REVIEW TEAM OF UT EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS AND SPECIALISTS. UT AGRESEARCH WILL UTILIZE THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE IT HAS PROVEN TOBE BOTH EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. HATCH REGULAR AND HATCH/MULTI-STATE RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERGO A REVIEW PROCESS FOR MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS, AND TO ENSURE ALIGNMENT WITH ESTABLISHED RESEARCH PRIORITIES. THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR HATCH REGULAR RESEARCH PROJECTS BEGINS INFORMALLY WITH DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PROJECT DIRECTOR, COLLEAGUES, THE DEPARTMENT HEAD, AND, IF APPLICABLE, AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS (IF FIELD WORK IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT). A REVIEW PANEL OF THREE SCIENTISTS THEN EVALUATES THE PROPOSAL FOR CLARITY, TECHNICAL RELEVANCE, AND SCIENTIFIC MERIT. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR MAKES ANY NECESSARY REVISIONS AND SUBMITS THE PROPOSAL TO THE DEPARTMENT HEAD FOR REVIEW. IF APPROVED, THE DEAN/DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH THEN CONDUCTS A FINAL EVALUATION AND ENDORSES THE PROPOSAL FOR SUBMISSION TO NIFA. HATCH/MULTI-STATE PROJECTS GO THROUGH A COMPARATIVELY MORE EXTENSIVE REVIEW AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL, SO THE INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS IS ABBREVIATED. THE FACULTY MEMBER OFFICIALLY JOINS A MULTI-STATE PROJECT AFTER CONSULTING WITH COLLEAGUES AND, IF APPLICABLE, THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR THEN SUBMITS A PROPOSAL REFLECTING THE UT COMPONENT DIRECTLY TO THE ASSOCIATE DEAN/ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT. ONCE THE REVIEW IS COMPLETE AND ANY NECESSARY CHANGES ARE MADE, THE RESEARCHER SUBMITS THE PROJECT TO NIFA. STAKEHOLDER INPUT UT EXTENSION PURSUED MULTIPLE DATA COLLECTIONS FOR THIS PLAN OF WORK. ALL 95 COUNTIES HAVE LOCAL EXTENSION ADVISORY GROUPS THAT PROVIDE ONGOING STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE UT-TSU EXTENSION STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL REVIEWS AND UPDATES PLANS BI-ANNUALLY. EXTENSIVE STRATEGIC PLAN ACTIVITIES ALSO INFORMED THIS PLAN. EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND STATE AGENCY LEADERS PARTICIPATED IN SURVEYS, LISTENING SESSIONS AND FOCUS GROUPS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW EXTENSION COULD ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. BASED ON THIS INPUT, THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL IDENTIFIED PLAN PRIORITIES. NEW STATE ACTION AGENDAS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS PRIORITIES. PLANS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE PROGRESS AND MAKE CHANGES. UT AGRESEARCH CONTINUES TO SEEK STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THROUGH SEVERAL MEANS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR TO DISCUSS AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES, UTIA PROGRAM PRIOR ITIES, AND HOW UTIA, INCLUDING UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION, MAY RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES. SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE TENNESSEE FARM BUREAU, AND SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE TENNESSEE STATE GOVERNMENT ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF COMMON RESEARCH INTERESTS. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS SERVE THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS AT THE INVITATION OF THE DEPARTMENT HEAD AND CENTER DIRECTOR, RESPECTIVELY, TO PROVIDE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES. FACULTY HELP DRIVE THE UT AGRESEARCH AGENDA BY REMAINING ABREAST OF EMERGING RESEARCH AND ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, PROGRAM LEADERS WITH STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING AGENCIES, THE PUBLIC, AND AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. ADDITIONALLY, THE UT SYSTEM IS COMPLETING A SURVEY THAT WENT STATEWIDE REGARDING PUBLIC INPUT INTO THE GRAND CHALLENGES FACING TENNESSEE. THIS WAS A UT SYSTEM EFFORT, BUT UT EXTENSION AND UT AGRESEARCH ASSISTED IN SHARING THE SURVEY ACROSS TENNESSEE AND THE RESULTS WILL CERTAINLY ADD TO THE INFORMATION WE USE TO DETERMINE DIRECTIONS FOR OUR WORK. UT AND TSU EXTENSION WILL EMPLOY THEIR EXTENSIVE, STATEWIDE NETWORK OF ADVISORY GROUPS FOR STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL PROVIDES INPUT AND DIRECTION FOR STATEWIDE INITIATIVES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION AGENTS WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON INVOLVING YOUTH AND OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES. ALL OF TENNESSEE'S 95 COUNTIES HAVE A COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE OF SEVEN LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, NOMINATED BY THE COUNTY MAYOR AND APPROVED BY MAJORITY VOTE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSION. EVERY COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEETS FOUR TIMES ANNUALLY, AND THEIR DUTIES INCLUDE INPUT INTO HIRING DECISIONS, LOCAL FUNDING, AND LOCAL PROGRAMMING. UT AGRESEARCH IMPLEMENTS SEVERAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS FOR INPUT. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE STATE GOVERNMENT, AND THE COMMUNITY. IT HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP ON RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION ISSUES. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS ARE COMPRISED OF THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE AND DEANS, REPRESENTATIVES FROM TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY GROUPS, AND CLIENTELE SERVED BY UTIA PROGRAMS. UTIA PERSONNEL NOMINATE THE COMMODITY GROUP AND CLIENTELEMEMBERS. EACH OF THE THREE REGIONAL ADVISORY GROUPS ELECTS A CHAIR TO GUIDE MEETINGS. IN ADDITION, UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. AS NEW PRIORITIES ARISE, THESE GROUPS SEEK OUT ONE ANOTHER TO DISCUSS COMMON RESEARCH NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS FOR THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS\u2019 AND GROUPS\u2019 RELEVANT BACKGROUND, EXPERTISE, AND COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. UT AGRESEARCH FACULTY REGULARLY INTERACT WITH THEIR PEERS AT PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND THROUGH JOINT PROJECT VENTURES. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS ENCOURAGE FACULTY TO MEET WITH PROGRAM LEADERS AT STATE AND NATIONAL FUNDING AGENCIES TO DISCUSS RESEARCH PRIORITIES. ADDITIONALLY, FACULTY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET WITH THE PUBLIC DURING AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER FIELD DAY EVENTS. TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT/TSU) AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS ARE TRAINED IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES AND HOW TO SELECT INDIVIDUALS FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES. COMMUNITY LEADERS SELECTED FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSITIES (I.E., GENDER, AGE, RACIAL/ETHNIC, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, EDUCATIONAL, ETC.) OF THE COUNTY OR AREA SERVED. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE CONDUCTS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR (SPECIFIC TO UT EXTENSION). EXTENSION RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PAST AND CURRENT EXTENSION PROGRAMS; AND THEY RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT USED EXTENSION TO SERVE ON LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND PARTICIPATE IN OPEN LISTENING SESSIONS. EXTENSION AGENTS ALSO CONDUCT SURVEYS ON PLANNED PROGRAM AREAS. UT AGRESEARCH COLLECTS INPUT THROUGH REGULAR CONTACT WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE AND THE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR. THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE RESPONDS TO ANY ISSUES RAISED, AND, AS APPROPRIATE, MAY DELEGATE ACTION TO THE DEANS/DIRECTORS OF UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS MEET WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THEY HAVE FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS WITH THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT HEADS AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS WITH THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER DIRECTORS MONTHLY; COLLECTIVELY THEY MEET ONCE PER YEAR. THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS MEET WITH THEIR ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS ANNUALLY AND SHARE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WITH AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY AS APPROPRIATE. FACULTY ATTEND PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND READ SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND POPULAR PRESS ARTICLES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. DEPARTMENTS HOLD MONTHLY FACULTY MEETINGS WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS WITH PEERS AND THEIR DEPARTMENT HEAD. STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES AT LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND STATEWIDE LEVEL MONITOR AND ADJUST DEPLOYMENT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, THE OPINIONS FROM MANY TENNESSEANS, INCLUDING DECISION-MAKERS, CLIENTELE, PARTNERS, AND VOLUNTEERS WERE CONSIDERED. MORE THAN 120 STAKEHOLDERS AND 490 UT EXTENSION EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATED IN THE REGIONAL AND CAMPUS LISTENING SESSIONS. THE PLANNING EFFORT ALSO INCLUDED AN ONLINE SURVEY COMPONENT. UT EXTENSION WILL ADDRESS THE INCREASING URBANIZATION AND A LOSS OF FARMLAND IN THE STATE ARE CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. OUR NURSERY, FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTION PROGRAMS WILL PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON PLANT, PEST, AND SOIL DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. THE CENTER FOR PROFITABLE AGRICULTURE WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON THE STATE'S AGRITOURISM INDUSTRY AND VALUE-ADDED PROGRAMS. HEALTH ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE TOP CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. EXTENSION STRENGTHENED HEALTH PROGRAMMING BY OFFERING THE CDC DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM. TO STRENGTHEN OUR EXTENSION AND RESEARCH FOR THE STATE'S BEEF CATTLE PRODUCERS, RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL WILL JOINTLY IMPLEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH IN HAY SCHOOLS, LATE GESTATION NUTRITION, MARKETING, FORAGE TESTING, AND STOCKPILED FORAGES.

MUCH OF THE STATE (54%) IS FORESTED, WITH THE MOST PREVALENT FOREST TYPES BEING OAK-HICKORY (40%) AND LOBLOLLY AND SHORTLEAF PINE (32%). THESE DIVERSE FORESTS PROVIDE HABITAT TO DIVERSE WILDLIFE SPECIES. THESE RANGE FROM GAME SPECIES, SUCH AS DEER, TURKEY, AND DUCKS, TO SONGBIRDS FOR WILDLIFE VIEWING, AND MANY REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS. ARKANSAS FORESTS ALSO PROVIDE CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO METROPOLITAN AREAS AND PROTECT OTHER IMPORTANT WATERSHEDS. RAW MATERIALS FROM ARKANSAS FORESTS SUPPORT A VIBRANT FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY THAT CONTRIBUTED $6 BILLION TO THE STATE\u2019S ECONOMY IN 2021. NON-INDUSTRIAL PRIVATE FOREST LANDOWNERS OWN 69% OF ARKANSAS\u2019S FORESTLANDS. THIS LANDOWNER GROUP IS EXTREMELY DIVERSE AND INCLUDES FARMERS, RANCHERS, HOMEOWNERS, TEACHERS, FACTORY WORKERS, PROFESSIONALS, AND RETIREES. THE DEMAND FOR BENEFITS FROM THE STATE'S FORESTS, INCLUDING WILDLIFE HABITAT AND FOREST PRODUCTS, MUST INCREASINGLY BE MET BY THESE PRIVATE FOREST LANDOWNERS. HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE LANDOWNERS ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, TIMBER MARKETING, HABITAT RESTORATION, REFORESTATION INCENTIVES, AND OTHER VITAL INFORMATION CRITICAL TO SUSTAINING FORESTLANDS. MOST OF THEM ALSO HOLD THEIR FORESTLANDS FOR REASONS OTHER THAN TIMBER MANAGEMENT. AS SUCH, THE SECURITY OF FUTURE TIMBER SUPPLIES AND FOREST HEALTH IS COMPROMISED BY LACK OF LANDOWNER KNOWLEDGE OF THESE ISSUES. SEVERAL ISSUES ARE THREATENING ARKANSAS FORESTS, HOWEVER. INVASIVE PESTS INCLUDING FERAL HOGS, EMERALD ASH BORER, AND LAUREL WILT DISEASE ARE BUT A FEW OF THE DIRECT FACTORS AFFECTING FOREST HEALTH IN RURAL AND URBAN FORESTS. FORESTERS ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT A POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PINE BARK BEETLES INCLUDING SOUTHERN PINE BEETLE RESULTING FROM STRESS FROM OVER-CROWDING AND DROUGHT. OTHER LESS DIRECT FACTORS ARE FOREST FRAGMENTATION, FOREST DENSIFICATION, CLIMATE VARIABILITY, AND A WEAK FOREST PRODUCTS MARKET. WEAK MARKETS CREATE CONSTRAINTS TO SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT FOR PRIVATE LANDOWNERS. NEW FOREST-BASED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BIO-ENERGY, WOOD PELLETS, ARE STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE BUT WILL HOPEFULLY AUGMENT AND INCREASE DEMAND FOR WOOD PRODUCTS. OUR GOAL THEN, IS TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF LANDOWNERS, MANAGERS, AND PROFESSIONALS TO MANAGE AND SUSTAIN HEALTHY FOREST ECOSYSTEMS THAT MEET HUMAN AND ECOL OGICAL NEEDS. ASSOCIATED WITH THIS GOAL, OUR OBJECTIVES ARE TO IMPROVE FORESTRY STAKEHOLDER AWARENESS OF FOREST AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BY: (1) HOSTING IN-PERSON EVENTS (WORKSHOPS, FIELD TOURS), (2) HOSTING VIRTUAL EVENTS (WEBINARS), (3) CONDUCTING DEMON STRATION PROJECTS, (4) DEVELOPING WEB-BASED MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND (5) PUBLISHING RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION THROUGH DIVERSE MEDIA (BULLETINS, POPULAR PRESS, MEDIA RELEASES, INTERNET ARTICLES).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bc2ca285-0b30-8c83-d330-1d7722983022-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23RREAFXXXG043_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 155356407, "Award ID": "NI23RREAFXXXG042", "Award Amount": 13500.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-22", "CFDA Number": "10.515", "Description": "RREA PROJECT ABSTRACT UAPB THE RREA PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT PINE BLUFF (UAPB) IS DESIGNED TO EDUCATE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED PRODUCERS (HUPS) ABOUT FORESTRY MANAGEMENT AND NAVIGATING THROUGH THE FORESTRY NETWORK.

ROBERT BARBER, JR. UNIVERSITY OF GUAM, COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: TWO ISSUES AND WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT: A. A LARGE AMOUNT OF FOREST LAND ON GUAM IS UNMANAGED, DESPITE A PAST WHERE THE FORESTS WERE A PRIMARY SOURCE OF FOOD, FUEL AND BUILDING MATERIALS, AS WELL AS OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES LIKE NUTRIENT BANKING AND EROSION CONTROL. CURRENTLY THERE IS A LIMITED NUMBER OF FOOD/MULTIPURPOSE TREES IN PUBLIC LANDS AND IDLE PRIVATE LAND FOR FOOD INSECURE FORAGERS TO TURN TO. CURRENTLY, ABSENT PROMOTION OF MULTIPURPOSE SPECIES (PARTICULARLY FOOD PRODUCING) THERE ARE LIMITED ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE LAND-OWNERS TO MANAGE THEIR FOREST AREAS. BOTH UOG CE<(>&<)>O\u2019S AG. <(>&<)> NATURAL RESOURCES (ANR) PROGRAM FACULTY AND FARMER COOPERATORS IN THE TWO GUAM SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICTS ARE INTERESTED IN PROMOTING AGROFORESTRY AND ASSOCIATED SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION PRACTICES AMONG GUAM LAND-OWNERS. B. GUAM IS AN ISOLATED ISLAND, THAT DEPENDS ON IMPORTS FOR AS MUCH AS 85-90 OF ITS PRODUCE NEEDS, THIS PUTS THE ISLAND AT RISK OF ISLAND-WIDE FOOD INSECURITY SHOULD SOMETHING HAPPEN TO THE PORT OR SHIPS BRINGING FOOD IN. FURTHER, PRE-COVID CHILD OBESITY STUDIES SUGGESTED ALARMING NUMBERS OF FAMILIES THAT WERE FOOD INSECURE, COVID INCREASE THESE NUMBERS AND THE DESIRE AMONG MANY FAMILIES TO ENGAGE IN SUBSISTENCE FOOD PRODUCTION. MULTI-YEAR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: GOAL 1: INCREASE GUAM'S FOOD SECURITY BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FOOD PRODUCING TREES ESTABLISHED ON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDS. GOAL 2: BUILD PARTNERSHIPS ON GUAM TO PROMOTE AGROFORESTRY SPECIES AND PRACTICES IN LOCAL AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY PROGRAMS. OBJECTIVES: 1) HOLD MEETINGS TO BUILD A NETWORK OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY PROFESSIONALS TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT WORKSHOPS AND OTHER COMMUNITY OU TREACH PROGRAMS PROMOTING OF MULTI-PURPOSE AGROFORESTRY SPECIES AND SUPPORTING SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION PRACTICES. 2) MAINTAIN ON UOG CAMPUS DEMONSTRATIONS OF MICO-PLOT AGROFORESTRY ESTABLISHMENT DEMONSTRATIONS FOR USE IN WORKSHOPS. 3) IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ABOVE NETWORK MEMBERS PILOT OUTREACH WORKSHOPS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON MULTI-PURPOSE AGROFORESTRY SPECIES AND SUPPORTING SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION PRACTICES. THESE WORKSHOPS WILL BE A MIX OF CLASSROOM LECTURE AND HANDS ON IN ON CAMPUS DEMONSTRATION PLOTS, PROVIDING PARTICIPANTS WITH PLANTING MATERIALS TO ESTABLISH IN THEIR OWN PLOTS. PILOT THESE WORKSHOPS WITH INDIVIDUAL/ORGANIZATIONS THAT WANT TO UTILIZE AGROFORESTRY PRACTICES IN SUBSISTENCE PRODUCTION. TARGET AUDIENCES AND HOW THEY WILL BENEFIT: THE PROJECT HAS TWO TARGET AUDIENCES: 1) AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN SHAPE PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE OUTREACH TO INDIVIDUALS/FAMILIES WHO CONTROL GUAM'S WORKING, FOREST, PUBLIC AND HIGHLY DEGRADED LANDS. THESE PROFESSIONALS CAN BENEFIT FROM A COALITION OF NATURAL RESOURCES PROFESSIONALS WHO SHARE/LEVERAGE PROGRAM RESOURCES, DEMONSTRATIONS, CURRICULUM AND PLANNING OF PROGRAMS PROMOTING ADDITION OF FOOD PRODUCING AND OTHER MULTI-PURPOSE SPECIES TO GUAM'S FORESTS. 2) INDIVIDUALS/FAMILIES AND PROGRAMS THAT CONTROL GUAM'S WORKING, FOREST, PUBLIC AND HIGHLY DEGRADED LANDS. IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS GUAM PROJECT WILL PILOT WORKING WITH A SPECIFIC SUBSET OF THIS GROUP; INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LEASE HOLDERS OR APPLICANTS OF THE CHAMORRO LAND TRUST COMMISSIONS' AGRICULTURE LEASE PROGRAM. A MINIMUM CLTC AGRICULTURE LEASE REQUIREMENT (WHICH PAST STUDIES INDICATE THAT MANY DO NOT MEET) IS THE PLANTING OF 50 TREES ON THEIR LEASE. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM'S WORKSHOPS THEY WILL BE PROVIDED WITH MANY, EASY TO PROPAGATE, FOOD PRODUCING TREES TO PLANT AND THEY WILL BE TAUGHT HOW TO PROPAGATE MORE. HOW ACTIVITIES RESULT IN MEETING THE GOAL STATEMENTS OR OBJECTIVES: AT A MINIMUM THE WORKSHOPS WILL PROVIDE FOOD PRODUCING TREES AND OTHER PERENNIALS TO LANDHOLDERS TO PLANT IF PLANTED THESE WILL MEET GOAL 1 AT A MINIMUM IF KNOWLEDGE OF TREE PROPAGATION IS UTILIZED BY PARTICIPANTS THIS NUMBER WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LEVERAGED. IF THE EFFORT OF MEETING WITH AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY PROFESSIONALS ON ISLAND IN ORDER TO BUILD A NETWORK WORKING TOGETHER IT IS HOPED THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT NURSERIES WILL PROPAGATE AND DISTRIBUTE MORE FOOD PRODUCING AND OTHER MULTI-PURPOSE TREES THROUGH THEIR PROGRAMS. THIS WILL IMPACT BOTH GOAL 2 AND GOAL 1. METHODOLOGY AGRICULTURE SUPPORT AGENCIES ON GUAM ARE SMALL AND LACK THE BREADTH OF EXPERTISE THAT WOULD BE FOUND IN ANALOGOUS AGENCIES ON THE MAINLAND. ISLAND-WIDE THE EXPERTISE POOL IS PROBABLY ADEQUATE TO MEET THE ISLAND\u2019S NEEDS BUT IS FRAGMENTED AMONG SEVERAL AGENCIES. CONSEQUENTLY, FARMERS HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE INFORMATION THEY NEED OR FINDING THE EXPERTISE TO EXPLAIN KEY CONCEPTS TO THEM WHEN THEY SEEK ADVICE. A KEY ASPECT OF THIS PROGRAM\u2019S IMPLEMENTATION IS THE COORDINATION AND LEVERAGE OF EXPERTISE AND PROGRAMS ACROSS AGENCIES, NONPROFITS AND ADVISORY BOARDS TO PROMOTE LANDOWNER ADOPTION OF THIS PROGRAMS RECOMMENDED PRACTICES. THE GUAM RREA PROGRAM WILL COORDINATE COLLABORATION AMONG AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT AGENCIES/NGOS, IN THE DELIVERY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS LANDOWNERS/MANAGERS, THROUGH NEED ASSESSMENT, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, DEMONSTRATIONS, AND WORKSHOP DELIVERY. THE PROGRAM WILL FACILITATE MULTI-AGENCY PROJECT PLANNING AMONG OUTREACH AGRICULTURE/FORESTRY PROFESSIONALS, AND COMMUNITY LEADERS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ENGAGE LANDOWNERS AND PUBLIC LAND USERS IN ADOPTION OF SUSTAINABLE AGROFORESTRY AND SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION PRACTICES. A KEY FOCUS IS TO INCREASE PUBLIC (URBAN) AND PRIVATE FORESTS, ECO/SOCIAL SYSTEM SERVICES; PRIMARILY FOOD PRODUCTS AND SOIL BUILDING/CONSERVATION. THE PRIMARY OUTREACH METHODS USED WILL BE: RECOMMENDED PRACTICE DEMONSTRATIONS, PEER/INNOVATOR LANDOWNER TOURS, AND MULTIAGENCY WORK SHOPS (WILL HAVE BOTH LECTURE AND HANDS ON COMPONENTS), PROMOTION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE AGROFORESTRY AND SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION.

EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON STATE IDENTIFIED NEEDS IN THE AREAS OF AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES; 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT; FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES; AND COMMUNITY, LEADERSHIP, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. NDSU EXTENSION CONTRIBUTES TO THESE AREAS BY PROVIDING TRANSFORMATIONAL EDUCATION AND CREATING/MAINTAINING PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE, REGION, AND NATION. NDSU EXTENSION IS COMMITTED TO THE CREATION OF AN INCLUSIVE AND MULTICULTURAL ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES APPROPRIATELY ALL THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. EXTENSION INCORPORATES A RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION OF THE VALUES AND BENEFITS THAT DIVERSITY CONTRIBUTES TO OUR ORGANIZATION'S LIFE AND MISSION. NDSU EXTENSION PROVIDES EQUAL ACCESS AND SERVICE TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES, A CORE VALUES OF OUR WORK. OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREMIER LIFETIME EDUCATION NETWORK THAT HELPS NORTH DAKOTANS IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. AS THE ISSUES FACING THEM BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, NDSU EXTENSION WILL CONTINUE TO MEET PEOPLE\u2019S NEEDS AS THEY ADAPT TO THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF NDSU EXTENSION PROGRAM - THE HARSH CLIMATE AND SHORT GROWING SEASON OF THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS ARE STRESSFUL TO TREES, LIMIT FORAGE PRODUCTION AND RANGE HEALTH, AND CAN LIMIT WILDLIFE POPULATIONS. THE FORESTS OF THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS REGION PROVIDE POCKETS OF DIVERSITY IN A BROADER AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, CREATING SHELTER IN A HARSH ENVIRONMENT WHILE ADDING BEAUTY TO THE LANDSCAPE.RANGE AND PASTURELAND COMPRISE OVER 30% OF NORTH DAKOTA AND ALMOST 50% OF THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS, PROVIDING THE FUNDAMENTAL FORAGE BASE TO THE COW/CALF INDUSTRY AND PRIMARY HABITAT FOR MOST WILDLIFE SPECIES IN THE REGION. SPECIES DIVERSITY IN THIS REGION IS OFTEN LIMITED, ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF INVASIVE SPECIES. THE EXTENSION FORESTRY AND RANGE PROGRAM AT NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY WILL RESPOND TO THESE PROBLEMS BY FOCUSING ON TWO PRIMARY AREAS \u2013 FOREST HEALTH (IN A BROAD SENSE) AND INVASIVE SPECIES OF RANGELANDS. TWO SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WILL BE EMPHASIZED: (1) FOREST SPECIES DIVERSITY, AND (2) RANGE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION. THE GOALS OF EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS ALL RELATE TO THE BROADER FIELD OF FOREST AND RANGE HEALTH AND FALL WITHIN THE RREA 2018-2022 STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS. FORESTRY PROGRAMS WILL FOCUS FIRST ON SOIL CONSERVATION DISTRICT (SCD) PERSONNEL, WHO DESIGN AND PLANT MOST OF THE CONSERVATION (WINDBREAK) PLANTINGS IN NORTH DAKOTA. WE WILL DETERMINE HOW THE DIVERSITY OF THOSE PLANTING PLANS CHANGES OVER THE COURSE OF THIS RREA PROJECT. A SECOND AUDIENCE IS THE MANAGERS OF THE VARIOUS ARBORETA AROUND THE STATE. MOST OF THESE ARBORETA ARE SMALL AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE PASSIVE, NOT ACTIVE. WE WILL WORK WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THEIR ACTIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AT THE ARBORETA. FOR THE RANGE PROGRAM, WE WILL IMPROVE ECOSYSTEM HEALTH BY INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF INDIVIDUALS, AGENCIES, AND COMMUNITIES TO RESPOND TO THREATS TO THESE RESOURCES, OR SIMPLY THE CHALLENGE OF PROVIDING RANGELANDS THAT ARE RICH IN DIVERSITY. ACTIVITIES INCREASING TREE SPECIES DIVERSITY IN NORTH DAKOTA IS CHALLENGING. WHILE THE REGIONAL CLIMATE AND SOIL TYPES LIMIT THE NUMBER OF SPECIES AND CULTIVARS THAT CAN GROW AND THRIVE HERE, CONSUMERS OFTEN HESITATE TO TRY NEW SPECIES. ONE APPROACH TO INCREASING SPECIES DIVERSITY IS TO PROVIDE IN-THE-FIELD EDUCATION AT THE VARIOUS ARBORETA FOUND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A PROJECT WAS BEGUN IN 2020 TO LOCATE AND INVENTORY THOSE ARBORETA. SECONDARILY, WE HAVE BEGUN TO WORK WITH THOSE ARBORETUM MANAGERS TO INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY FOR ACTIVE EDUCATION WITH THEIR CLIENTELE. THAT IS, WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL UTILIZE THEIR ARBORETA TO HOST WORKSHOPS OR EVEN JUST TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED TOURS TO INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS. THE WORK WITH ARBORETUM MANAGERS WILL PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR THE FORESTRY PORTION OF OUR RREA PROJECT. THIS WILL INVOLVE A COMBINATION OF ONE-ON-ONE TRAINING AND REGIONAL WORKSHOPS. ALSO, WE ARE WORKING WITH COUNTY-LEVEL PERSONNEL (EXTENSION AGENTS AND SCD PERSONNEL) TO INCREASE THEIR AWARENESS AND USE OF THEIR LOCAL/REGIONAL ARBORETUM RESOURCES. THESE EFFORTS WILL BE EVALUATED AT THE END OF THE PROJECT WITH A SIMPLE SURVEY. ADDITIONAL WORK WITH SCD PERSONNEL WILL OCCUR THROUGH A SERIES OF TRAINING COURSES THAT WILL FOCUS ON SPECIES DIVERSITY IN THEIR PLANTING PLANS. THOUGH THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON ALLOWABLE TREE SPECIES IN CONSERVATION PLANS, DEPENDING ON SOIL TYPES, THERE ARE CERTAIN SPECIES THAT ARE FAVORED OR PREFERRED FOR PLANTING. THIS COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT WILL FIRST INVOLVE A REVIEW OF SPECIES DIVERSITY IN PREVIOUS YEARS (APPROXIMATELY 5 YEARS AGO), FOLLOWED BY A REVIEW OF SPECIES IN THE MOST-RECENT YEAR\u2019S PLANTINGS. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WILL BE OFFERED IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE RREA PROGRAM, AND THEN FOLLOWED WITH A REVIEW OF PLANTING PLANS TO DETERMINE IF THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN SPECIES DIVERSITY IN WINDBREAKS AND OTHER CONSERVATION PLANTINGS. METHODS TO EVALUATE THE EDUCATIONAL TRAINING IMPACTS OF RANGELAND TECHNICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL INCLUDE TWO TO THREE WORKSHOPS PER YEAR ON NOXIOUS AND INVASIVE PLANTS WITH PRE- AND POST-SURVEYS. FOLLOW-UP SURVEYS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE DIRECT IMPACT ON ACRES WITH ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL PARAMETERS CALCULATED. DEMONSTRATION AND RESEARCH PROJECTS (DEVELOPED WITH NON-RREA FUNDING) WILL BE DEVELOPED ON PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LANDS TO EVALUATE DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION TO CREATE NEW EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND POTENTIAL OUTCOMES FOR LAND MANAGERS.

CHEYENNE, THE CAPITAL AND LARGEST CITY, HAS A POPULATION OF 65,132 AND IS LOCATED IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF WYOMING. THE STATE IS DIVIDED INTO 23 COUNTIES AND THE WIND RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION. MOST OF THE STATE\u2019S ECONOMY IS CONCENTRATED IN THREE SECTORS: AGRICULTURE, MINERALS, AND TOURISM. WYOMING\u2019S LAND USE IS ALMOST HALF AGRICULTURAL, AT 48.6% WITH 30,169,526 ACRES. ACCORDING TO THE 2017 CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE, WYOMING PRODUCERS OPERATED THE LARGEST FARMS AND RANCHES IN THE U.S. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 2 ,430 ACRES PER FARM, OVER FIVE TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE SIZE. NINETY PERCENT (90%) OF WYOMING\u2019S AGRICULTURAL LAND IS CLASSIFIED AS RANGELANDS. THE WYOMING STATE AND PRIVATE FORESTRY FACT SHEET IN 2021 INDICATED THERE ARE 10,556,536 ACRES OF FOREST LAND IN WYOMING. LESS THAN 20% OF WYOMING FORESTS ARE OWNED BY NONINDUSTRIAL PRIVATE ENTITIES. WYOMING\u2019S RANGELANDS PROVIDE A WIDE VARIETY OF GOODS AND SERVICES TO LOCAL ECONOMIES, INCLUDING CLEAN WATER, WILDLIFE HABITAT, DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK GRAZING, ENERGY EXTRACTION, TOURISM, AND RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES. MOST LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION OCCURS ON WYOMING\u2019S RANGELANDS AND ACCOUNTS FOR 74% OF ALL CASH RECEIPTS FROM AGRICULTURE IN WYOMING. RANGELAND USE DRAWS THE ATTENTION OF DIVERSE AUDIENCES: RANCHERS, SMALL ACREAGE LANDOWNERS, RECREATIONIST, CONSERVATION GROUPS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND BUSINESSES. AS SUCH, SUSTAINABLE RANGELAND MANAGEMENT EQUATES TO ECONOMIC STABILITY IN WYOMING. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF UW EXTENSION PROGRAMMING FOR RANGELAND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IS TO SUSTAIN OR IMPROVE RANGELAND HEALTH AND RANCHES PROFITABILITY. A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FACING RANCHERS AND RANCH MANAGERS IS INCREASED CLIMATE VARIABILITY. CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION EFFECT MANY ASPECTS OF RANGE MANAGEMENT. RANCHERS AND RANCH MANAGERS MUST UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE DROUGHT MANAGEMENT PLANS, MANAGEMENT OF INTENSIVE GRAZING STRATEGIES, AND TECHNIQUES TO CONTROL INVASIVE AND NOXIOUS WEEDS. AS A RESULT OF EXTENSION\u2019S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND OTHER RESOURCES WHICH SUPPORT EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS PRODUCERS AND MANAGERS WILL ADOPT PRACTICES THAT IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY ON RANGELANDS. EXAMPLES OF EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS ARE HIGHLIGHTED BELOW: \u2022 INVASIVE WEEDS CAN CHANGE THE ECOLOGY OF A LANDSCAPE BY REPLACING NATIVE VEGETATION WHICH WILL HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON SOIL HEALTH, WILDLIFE BOTH INVERTEBRATES AND VERTEBRATES, AND LIVESTOCK. LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT INVASIVE WEEDS CAUSE A REDUCTION IN FORAGE AND SEEK EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND TRIALS TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF INVASIVE WEEDS. LANDOWNERS AND LAND MANAGERS PARTICIPATING IN UWE PROGRAMS WILL SEE REDUCED AREAS INFESTED WITH INVASIVE AND NOXIOUS WEEDS. \u2022 REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE PRACTICES IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND FUNCTION OF SOIL. THESE BENEFITS LEAD TO BETTER NUTRIENT CYCLING, IMPROVED WATER INFILTRATION AND MORE CONSISTENT YIELDS OVER TIME. ADDITIONALLY, COVER CROPS SUPPRESS WEEDS, PREVENT EROSION, CONTROL DISEASES AND PESTS AS WELL AS HELP POLLINATORS. REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE PRACTICES ARE ALSO USED TO PROVIDE FORAGE FOR LIVESTOCK. WHEN COVER CROPS ARE GRAZED, ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THE SPECIES THAT WILL BENEFIT SOIL HEALTH, BE PALATABLE AND SAFE AS FORAGE FOR LIVESTOCK, AND THE ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE WITH STOCKING RATES DUE TO THE VARIABILITY IN COVER CROP PRODUCTIVITY. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ASSIST PRODUCERS IN GATHERING RESOURCES ON COVER CROP OPTIONS, HOW TO PLANT AND STRATEGIES FOR USE. INTEREST IN REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE PRACTICES HAS GROWN AS PRODUCERS HAVE SEEN INCREASED FORAGE SUPPLY, GROWING FORAGES IN PLACES THAT HAD BEEN UNPRODUCTIVE, AND IN WEED CONTROL EFFORTS ON RANGELANDS. \u2022 GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANNUAL OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS FOR GRAZING PERMITS ON FEDERAL LANDS. THIS WILL LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PRODUCERS AND/OR RANCH MANAGERS WHO STAY IN COMPLIANCE WITH GRAZING PERMITS ON FEDERAL LANDS. \u2022 WHEN PUBLIC SPACE IS CONCERNED, THE DECISION MAKER CAN BE ANYONE. UNDERSTANDING HOW THE SHARED RESOURCE IS USED AND MANAGED CAN HELP NAVIGATE CONFLICT RESULTING FROM DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS OF USER GROUPS. EXAMPLES OF UNDERSTANDING BASIC CAUSE AND EFFECT WITH THE ECOSYSTEM INCLUDE WHY IT\u2019S IMPORTANT TO \u2018SHUT THE GATE\u2019, OR A RECREATIONAL FISHERMAN UNDERSTANDING THE SENSITIVITIES OF A RIPARIAN ZONE. \u2022 MULTIPLE USER GROUPS REQUIRE AND/OR VALUE ACCESS TO UNMODIFIED RANGELANDS IN THE WESTERN US. MANY RANCHERS RELY ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO GRAZE LARGE ACREAGES OF PUBLIC LAND TO MAINTAIN THE VIABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS. INCREASINGLY, RECREATIONISTS (TO INCLUDE HUNTERS, HIKERS, WILDLIFE VIEWERS, ETC.) ARE VALUING THE WIDE-OPEN SPACES THAT RANGELANDS PROVIDE. WHILE USE AND PUBLIC INTEREST IN RANGELANDS IS INCREASING, PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DIFFERENCES IN HOW DIFFERENT LANDS ARE MANAGED HAS NOT KEPT PACE. \u2022 KNOWLEDGE OF DISASTER RESOURCES, DEVELOPMENT OF DISASTER PLANS, AND EFFECTIVE DECISION-MAKING STRATEGIES WILL ALSO PREPARE INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL DISASTERS AND ENGAGE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES TO REDUCE THEIR VULNERABILITY TO DISASTERS. ANOTHER ISSUE AFFECTING WYOMING IS THE INCREASING NUMBER OF SMALL ACREAGE OWNERS. THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF FORMER RANCH, FARM OR WILDLANDS ARE BEING SUBDIVIDED INTO SMALL ACREAGE PARCELS WITH LANDOWNERS WHO HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE MANAGING RANGELANDS. THIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE LEADS TO SOIL EROSION, DECREASED AND FRAGMENTED WILDLIFE HABITAT, INVASIVE NOXIOUS WEED INFESTATIONS, AND GRASSLAND DEGRADATION. THE SMALL ACREAGE OUTREACH PROJECT PROVIDES SMALL ACREAGE LANDOWNERS WITH INFORMATION NEEDED TO SUSTAINABLY MANAGE THEIR LAND. ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES FOR SMALL ACREAGE LANDOWNERS INCLUDE: \u2022 INCREASE IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NUMBER OF LIVESTOCK DIFFERENT SIZES OF PROPERTIES CAN SUPPORT WITHOUT DECREASING PASTURE HEALTH AND INCREASING WEEDS. THIS WILL ALLOW SMALL ACREAGE OWNERS TO BETTER MANAGE THEIR PASTURES. \u2022 LEARN TACTICS TO PROPERLY ID AND CONTROL INVASIVE WEEDS AND IMPLEMENT THESE TACTICS. MORE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF INVASIVE WEEDS WILL CREATE HEALTHIER RANGELANDS AND PASTURES. \u2022 GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW FENCING CHOICES IMPACT WILDLIFE MOVEMENT. SMALL ACREAGE LANDOWNERS WILL CONSIDER WILDLIFE MOVEMENT WHEN INSTALLING OR REPLACING FENCING. \u2022 LEARN ABOUT THE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THROUGH OUR MATERIALS TO HELP THEM BE BETTER LAND STEWARDS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "961d0f85-7803-bf5a-32c5-a4ea8ffa3dbb-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23RREAFXXXG023_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736258, "Award ID": "NI23RREAFXXXG022", "Award Amount": 13500.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-22", "CFDA Number": "10.515", "Description": "SUSTAINING FOREST RESOURCES IN THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS THE ECONOMY OF THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS IS PREDOMINANTLY DEPENDENT UPON THE TOURISM INDUSTRY. OUR NATURAL RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE ECONOMY AND ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. THE NEED EXISTS, THEREFORE, TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEM THAT CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR RESIDENTS AND VISITORS. THERE ARE MANY COMPETING DEMANDS FOR OUR LIMITED LAND RESOURCES. POLICYMAKERS ARE FACED WITH TOUGH DECISIONS AS THEY TRY TO FIND A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE INCREASED NEEDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS RELATED TO LAND FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING. THIS USUALLY RESULTS IN FURTHER FOREST FRAGMENTATION AND THE ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS ARE FORCED TO MAKE FINANCIAL DECISIONS REGARDING THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THEIR PROPERTIES. MANY OF THESE LANDOWNERS ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH PROPER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR TREES AND FORESTS. THEY MUST BECOME AWARE OF THE BENEFITS OF PROPER LAND STEWARDSHIP AND HOW IT SUPPORTS OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. THEY ALSO NEED TO BE MADE AWARE OF THE VALUE OF TREES/FORESTS AND WHAT THEY PROVIDE TO LOCAL ECONOMIES - INCLUDING THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO THE TOURISM INDUSTRY AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF RESIDENTS. TREES/FORESTS MUST BE APPRECIATED FOR ENCOURAGING BIODIVERSITY, PROVIDING OPEN SPACES AND RECREATIONAL OPPO RTUNITIES. PROPER TREE ESTABLISHMENT, CARE AND MAINTENANCE ARE SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT WILL BE EMPHASIZED. PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WILL ASSIST IN GETTING INFORMATION TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS. THIS WILL HELP TO IMPROVE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS. THE INFORMATION WILL BE PRIMARILY PROVIDED THROUGH WORKSHOPS, SITE VISITS, DEMONSTRATIONS, WEBPAGES AND SEMINARS. STAKEHOLDERS WILL ALSO BE MADE AWARE OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON WEATHER, ESPECIALLY DROUGHTS, FLOODING, THE SEVERITY OF TROPICAL STORMS/HURRICANES AND HOW BEST TO MITIGATE THESE EFFECTS. THE HURRICANE SEASON LASTS FOR SIX MONTHS EACH YEAR. DURING THIS TIME OUR TREES/URBAN FORESTS ARE VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE PASSAGE OF STORMS OF VARYING INTENSITIES. WE WILL FOCUS ON STRATEGIES THAT PREPARE OUR URBAN FORESTS TO WITHSTAND DIVERSE/EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND HOW TO RECOVER FROM SUCH EVENTS. THE RECYCLING OF FALLEN TREES AND PARTS OF TREES INTO VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS WILL ALSO BE INCLUDED. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED A PROGRAM TO RECYCLE GREEN WASTE INTO COMPOST AND MULCH, WE WILL PARTNER WITH THIS PROGRAM IN THE EDUCATIONAL ASPECT. THE PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON THE CRITICAL ISSUES OF PUBLIC AWARENESS AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT, ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, ENHANCING RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON FORESTS AND PROVIDING INCREASED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. THE CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES WILL BE CLIMATE VARIABILITY, URBANIZATION AND INVASIVE SPECIES. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES ARE TO: 1) COMMUNICATE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM TREE POPULATIONS AND ASSOCIATED NATURAL RESOURCES; 2) DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH COOPERATING STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, ORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESSES, AND LANDOWNERS TO REACH AND ENGAGE S TAKEHOLDERS MORE EFFECTIVELY; 3) EDUCATE LANDOWNERS, NATURAL RESOURCE EXTENSION AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS, AND YOUTH ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF APPLYING PRACTICES THAT S USTAIN TREE POPULATIONS; 4) DELIVER RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THAT WILL HELP GUIDE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES THAT ENHANCE WORKING LANDSCAPES. THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF LANDOWNERS, NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS, OTHER EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS, URBAN FORESTERS, FORESTRY PROFESSIONALS, POLICYMAKERS, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY PERSONNEL, NGOS, YOUTH AND YOUTH GROUPS, FORESTRY COUNCIL MEMBERS, AGRICULTURE ADVISORY GROUPS, LANDSCAPERS, WOODWORKERS/WOOD ARTISANS AND RESIDENTS. THE PROJECT WILL UTILIZE THE FOLLOWING OUTPUTS AS EDUCATIONAL STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: WORKSHOPS; SITE VISITS; CONSULTATIONS; TRAINING SESSIONS; SEMINARS AND COUNSELING. THESE WILL BE TARGETED TO: LANDOWNERS; NATURAL RESOURCES AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS; URBAN AND OTHER FORESTERS. THEY WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ALONG WITH NONGOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND OTHER GROUPS, ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE AN INCREASE IN: PARTICIPATION OF LANDOWNERS IN EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES; THE NUMBER OF LANDOWNERS AND PROPERTY MANAGERS WITH IMPROVED DECISIONS MAKING SKILLS; KNOWLEDGE OF LANDOWNERS AND RESIDENTS ABOUT PROPERLY MANAGING TREE POPULATIONS; KNOWLEDGE OF LANDOWNERS AND RESIDENTS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF TREE POPULATIONS; KNOWLEDGE OF LANDOWNERS AND RESIDENTS ABOUT NATIVE, NATURALIZED AND INVASIVE TREE SPECIES AND INCOME OF WOODWORKERS RECYCLING TREE PARTS INTO VALUE-ADDED ITEMS. FOR EACH OBJECTIVE, THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING, PROMOTING AND DELIVERING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN VARIOUS FORMATS INCLUDING: WORKSHOPS; HANDS-ON DEMONSTRATIONS; SHORT COURSES; INFORMAL CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION; EDUCATIONAL DISPLAYS; INTERNET WEBPAGES; TOURS; AND SEMINARS ALONG WITH WEBINARS, ONLINE TRAINING AND VIDEOS. EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND DISSEMINATED TO THE TARGET AUDIENCE. PARTNERSHIPS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED WITH STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL DEPARTMENTS/AGENCIES AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. COMMUNITY DECISION-MAKING WILL BE PROMOTED THROUGH INCREASING THE PUBLIC'S UNDERSTANDING AND INVOLVEMENT. THIS WILL ALLOW STAKEHOLDERS TO RECOGNIZE PROBLEMS AND BECOME INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS TO RESOLVE THEM. THE MEDIA WILL BE UTILIZED TO PROMOTE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PROGRAM.

ALREADY POSING SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO FORESTED ECOSYSTEMS, THE IMPACTS OF INVASIVE SPECIES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE WITH CLIMATE VARIATION AND MORE FREQUENT EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. POSITIONING LANDOWNERS AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGERS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF INVASIVE SPECIES IS CRUCIAL. MANAGED FORESTS, NATURAL AREAS, URBAN GREEN SPACES, PASTURES, WATERWAYS, ROADSIDES AND RIGHT OF WAYS ARE ALL IMPACTED BY INVASIVE SPECIES. SPECIFICALLY, INVASIVE PLANTS DISPLACE NATIVE PLANT SPECIES AND THE WILDLIFE AND INSECTS THAT DEPEND ON THEM. FIRE REGIMES, WATER CYCLES, NUTRIENT CYCLES, AND FOREST REGENERATION ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INVASIVE SPECIES. THREATS ARE COMPOUNDED WITH DISTURBANCES CREATED BY EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. CONSEQUENTLY, INVASIVE SPECIES POSE AN INCREASING THREAT TO FOREST PRODUCTIVITY, FOREST MANAGEMENT OPTIONS, WILDLIFE HABITAT, OUTDOOR RECREATION, AND OVERALL ECOSYSTEM HEALTH. IN ADDITION TO THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND REDUCED PRODUCTIVITY, INVASIVE PLANT CONTROL IS EXPENSIVE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY COSTS MOUNT TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR. PREVENTING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INVASIVE PLANTS AND FINDING AND TREATING INFESTATIONS WHEN STILL SMALL ARE THE MOST COSTEFFECTIVE WAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD AND REDUCE THE IMPACT OF INVASIVE PLANTS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. PREVENTION, EARLY DETECTION AND ADVANCE TREATMENT ARE ALSO IMPORTANT TOOLS FOR MINIMIZING IMPACTS OF INVASIVE SPECIES FOLLOWING EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND OTHER LANDSCAPE DISTURBANCES. STAKEHOLDERS CONSISTENTLY IDENTIFY INVASIVE SPECIES AS A TOP NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUE OF CONCERN. OBJECTIVES: LANDOWNER EDUCATION AND CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS ARE KEY TO REDUCING THE IMPACTS OF INVASIVE PLANTS AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF ALABAMA FORESTS. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO EXPAND AWARENESS OF INVASIVE SPECIES, INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF INVASIVE PLANT IDENTIFICATION, IMPACTS, AND CONTROL OPTIONS. A SECONDARY, BUT CLOSELY ALIGNED OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN STATE AND REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH RELEVANT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS ADDRESSING ISSUES RELATED TO ASSESSMENT, MAPPING, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL, RESEARCH, AND EDUCATION. INVASIVE PLANTS WILL BE OUR MAIN FOCUS, BUT EMERGING INVASIVE INSECT AND ANIMAL PESTS MAY ALSO BE ADDRESSED. TARGET AUDIENCE: THE PRIMARY TARGET AUDIENCES ARE FOREST LANDOWNERS AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS (E.G., FORESTERS, LOGGERS, WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS) AND STUDENTS OF NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE NONNATIVE PLANTS USED IN LANDSCAPING ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF THE INVASIVE PLANTS THAT INVADE FORESTS, A SECONDARY AUDIENCE IS HOMEOWNERS, MASTER GARDENERS, THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND K12 EDUCATORS. DELIVERABLES COMMUNICATION PRODUCTS: PRIMARY COMMUNICATION PRODUCTS WILL INCLUDE EXTENSION PUBLICATIONS ADDRESSING INVASIVE PLANT IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL; FREQUENT POSTS TO THE ALABAMA EXTENSION INVASIVE PLANT FACEBOOK PAGE THAT WE ADMINISTER; BLOGS AND SHORT ARTICLES FOR POPULAR PRESS AND THE TEAM NEWSLETTER; CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ALABAMA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SYSTEM (ACES) FORESTRY AND WILDLIFE WEBPAGE; AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF HIGH DEFINITION PHOTOGRAPHS OF INVASIVE PLANTS FOR USE IN EDUCATIONAL PRODUCTS AND OTHER OUTREACH NEEDS. EVENTS: OUTREACH EVENTS WILL INCLUDE COCHAIRING THE STATEWIDE ANNUAL ALABAMA INVASIVE PLANT COUNCIL CONFERENCE; ORGANIZING AND PARTICIPATING IN ACES WORKSHOPS AND FIELD DAYS; PROVIDING SEMINARS AND WEBINARS FOR FOREST INDUSTRY, FOREST AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AGENCIES, MASTER GARDENERS, CIVIC GROUPS AND OTHERS AS REQUESTED (TYPICALLY ABOUT 20 EVENTS A YEAR.) MANY OF THESE EVENTS PROVIDE CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDITS FOR NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS. SERVICES AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES: QUESTIONS FROM LANDOWNERS, NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGERS, EXTENSION AGENTS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC ARE FIELDED EACH YEAR. MOSTINVOLVEPLANT IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR INVASIVE PLANTS. WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED QUESTIONS ARE ADDRESSED EACH YEAR VIA PHONE, EMAIL, TEXT AND SOCIAL MEDIA. WE ALSO TEACH A SECTION ON INVASIVE PLANTS TO AUBURN UNIVERSITY FORESTRY AND WILDLIFE STUDENTS, LEAD THE EFFORT TO UPDATE THE ALABAMA INVASIVE PLANT COUNCIL (ALIPC) INVASIVE PLANT LIST (A NONREGULATORY STATE LIST), AND PROVIDE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE TO LOCAL INVASIVE PLANT CONTROL EFFORTS. BUILDING CAPACITY: COLLABORATING WITH STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDER PARTNERS STRENGTHENS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. SERVING ON STATEWIDE INVASIVE PLANT TASK FORCES AND COMMITTEES AND MAINTAINING A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITHIN THE ALABAMA INVASIVE PLANT COUNCIL ARE IMPORTANT AVENUES FOR EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION. REGIONAL PUBLICATIONS AND EVENTS ARE PERIODICALLY ORGANIZED THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH SOUTHERN REGION EXTENSION FORESTRY AND OTHER COLLEAGUES IN THE REGION. INVOLVEMENT IN ONE REGIONAL EFFORT IS LEADING TODEATE BENEFIT IS IMPROVED FOREST HEALTH THROUGH REDUCED SPREAD AND IMPACTS OF INVASIVE PLANTS. A CHANGE IN KNOWLEDGE WILL BE REFLECTED THROUGH AN INCREASED NUMBER OF LANDOWNERS AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS WHO KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY INVASIVE PLANTS AND KNOW WHERE TO ACCESS SCIENCE-BASED INFORMATION AND RESOURCES; INCREASED NUMBER OF LANDOWNERS AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF EFFECTIVE OPTIONS FOR INVASIVE PLANT PREVENTION AND CONTROL; AND INCREASED AWARENESS OF EDDMAPS. A CHANGE IN ACTION WILL BE REFLECTED THROUGH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LANDOWNERS AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS WHO MONITOR FOR, AND INITIATE OR CONTINUE INVASIVE PLANT MONITORING AND CONTROL EFFORTS, LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ACRES TREATED; A REDUCTION IN BEHAVIORS THAT SPREAD INVASIVE PLANTS; FEWER HOMEOWNERS AND LAND MANAGERS USING RISKY NON-NATIVE PLANTS IN LANDSCAPING AND WILDLIFE PLANTINGS; AND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO USE EDDMAPS TO REPORT INVASIVE PLANTS. ULTIMATELY, THE EXPECTED OUTCOME IS IMPROVED FOREST HEALTH AND RESILIENCY THROUGH REDUCED USE OF NON-NATIVE PLANTS IN LANDSCAPING AND WILDLIFE PLANTINGS; REDUCTIONS IN BEHAVIORS THAT SPREAD INVASIVE PLANTS; AND EARLIER AND MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF INVASIVE PLANTS.

EVEN WITH THE RICH MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST RESOURCES, MUSHROOM PRODUCTION AMONG THE UNDERSERVED FARMERS AND FOREST LANDOWNERS (UFFLOS) IS SCARCELY CONSIDERED AS A SOURCE OF FRESH FOODS AND/OR AN ECONOMIC ENDEAVOR TO BOOST ADDITIONAL INCOME WHILE WAITING FOR TIMBER TO MATURE. THE CULTIVATION OF SPECIALTY CROPS SUCH AS SHIITAKE (LENTINULA EDODES) AND OYSTER (PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS) MUSHROOMS COULD BE A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF FRESH FOOD THAT CAN MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF FOOD INSECURITY IN MISSISSIPPI. EDIBLE MUSHROOMS ARE GLOBALLY CONSIDERED AS HEALTHY FOOD, LOW IN CALORIES WITH EXCELLENT NUTRITIVE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES, AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL IN FOOD SECURITY MUSHROOMS ARE DESIRABLE IN AREAS WITH FOOD INSECURITY BECAUSE THEY CONVERT INFERIOR LIGNOCELLULOSIC WASTE LEFT IN FORESTS AFTER TIMBER HARVESTING INTO HIGHLY NUTRITIOUS AND HEALTHY FOOD. THE TECHNOLOGY OF MUSHROOM CULTIVATION IS ONE OF THE FEW MICROBIAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR BIOCONVERSION OF INFERIOR WASTE WOOD AND AGRICULTURAL RESIDUES TO FUNCTIONAL FOODS THUS, THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR THE PROJECT IS TO EDUCATE OUR TARGET AUDIENCE ON THE ECONOMIES AND TECHNOLOGY REGARDING THE CULTIVATION OF VARIOUS OUTDOOR EDIBLE MUSHROOMS USING WASTE WOOD AND AGRICULTURAL RESIDUES.

LOSS OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF FORESTS AND GRASSLANDS ARE UNDESIRABLE, BUT THEY MAY BE PARTICULARLY SO ON ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED SMALL FARMS. THE GOAL OF OUR PROJECT IS TO INCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF DISADVANTAGED AND MINORITY FARMERS WHO OWN SMALL FARMS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI BY OFFERING INFORMATION AND TRAINING NEEDED FOR ENHANCING RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON FORESTS AND RANGELANDS. WE WILL PROMOTE CONSERVATION OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND INCREASE ECONOMIC RESILIENCE OF SMALL FARMS BY PROVIDING INFORMATION AND SUPPORT FOR CONTROL AND PREVENTION OF EMERGING NON-NATIVE INVASIVE PLANTS. BECAUSE MOST CENTRAL AND SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI FARMS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL AND CONSIST OF A MIX OF GRASSLAND, FOREST, AND SOMETIMES CROPLAND, WE PROPOSE AN INTEGRATED APPROACH. WE PROPOSE TO PRODUCE FACT SHEETS, BROCHURES, AND TRAINING WORKSHOPS ON SUBJECTS SUCH AS PRESCRIBED FIRE, TIMBER STAND IMPROVEMENTS, AND ENHANCEMENT OF NATIVE PLANTS FOR GRASSLANDS AND FORESTS, AND CONTROL AND PREVENTION OF INVASIVE PLANTS. WE AIM TO REACH AS MANY FARM OWNERS AS POSSIBLE, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, THROUGH TRAINING WORKSHOPS AND PUBLICATIONS, RESPECTIVELY. FOR FY 2023, OUR OBJECTIVES ARE TO: 1. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FARMERS WHO UNDERSTAND AND USE MODERN METHODS FOR PREVENTING OR REDUCING DAMAGE TO FORESTS AND GRASSLANDS CAUSED BY NON-NATIVE INVASIVE PLANTS AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ACRES WHERE SUCH METHODS ARE USED; 2. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FARMERS WHO USE PRESCRIBED FIRE IN GRASSLANDS AND FORESTS TO PROMOTE BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY AND DIVERSITY AND THE NUMBER OF ACRES IMPROVED BY THIS METHOD; 3. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FARMERS WHO USE NATIVE PLANTS TO ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY AND DIVERSITY OF THEIR FORESTS AND GRASSLANDS AND THE NUMBER OF ACRES WHERE SUCH PLANTS ARE SEEDED OR PLANTED; AND 4. EVALUATE THE OUTCOMES AND IMPACT OF OUR PROJECT. PRODUCTS EVENTS: WE PROPOSE TO OFFER TRAINING ON INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF GRASSLANDS AND FOREST, THROUGH USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE, BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL, PLANTING NATIVE PLANTS, ROTATIONAL GRAZING, AND CONTROL OF NON-NATIVE INVASIVE PLANTS. WE WILL ALSO PRODUCE BROCHURES AND FACT SHEETS TO INFORM ABOUT DAMAGING INVASIVE PLANTS. TRAINING WILL BE OFFERED IN COLLABORATION WITH STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCY SPECIALISTS FROM MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION, USDA SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION SERVICE, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, ETC. EXPECTED OUTCOMES THE GOALS OF OUR PROJECT ARE TO ENHANCE BIOLOGICALDIVERSITY ON SMALL FARMS AND TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND HEALTH OF FORESTS AND GRASSLANDS BY INCREASING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DAMAGING INVASIVE SPECIES. OUR OUTCOMES WILL BE: 1. INCREASED NUMBER OF FARMS AND ACRES WHERE ROTATIONAL GRAZING, PRESCRIBED FIRE, TIMBER STAND IMPROVEMENTS, NATIVE PLANTS, AND CONTROL OF INVASIVE SPECIES ARE USED; 2.

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE HEALTHY FOREST ECOSYSTEMS FOR KENTUCKY'S SMALL WOODLAND OWNERS ARE CRITICAL TO THE CONTINUED PROTECTION AND UTILIZATION OF KENTUCKY'S FORESTS. COMPLEX ECOSYSTEMS WITH BIOTIC INTERACTIONS AMONG PLANTS, ANIMALS, AND MICROORGANISMS AS WELL AS ABIOTIC, PHYSICAL, AND CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE HEALTH OF FORESTS, WATERSHEDS, AND AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEMS. FOREST HEALTH, IN TERMS OF FUNCTION OF RIPARIAN/WETLAND VEGETATION, CAN BE ENHANCED THROUGH SILVICULTURE AND AGROFORESTRY APPROACHES THAT SUPPORT NATIVE PLANT POPULATIONS, REDUCE INVASIVE SPECIES, PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF RIPARIAN ZONES, AND INCREASE WATER QUALITY. ALMOST HALF (48%) OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY\u2019S LAND IS COVERED IN FOREST. THERE ARE 467,000 SMALL PRIVATE WOODLAND OWNERS. MUCH OF THE STATE\u2019S REMAINING LAND IS OCCUPIED BY 12.9 MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND, WITH NEARLY 75,000 FARMS, MOST BEING SMALL-SCALE, FAMILY OPERATIONS. WITH SUCH FRAGMENTED OWNERSHIP, ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND ADEQUATE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. THEREFORE, PROGRAMS THAT HELP LANDOWNERS AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT HEALTHY FOREST AND RANGELAND ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT AND PROTECTION OF KENTUCKY\u2019S LANDS, WATERS, WILDLIFE, AND ECONOMIC RESOURCES.

RREA GOAL 3: BUILDING CAPACITY THROUGH ENHANCED CONNECTIONS 1. COMMUNICATION, EDUCATION, AND INFORMATION DELIVERY (KA 903 COMMUNICATION, EDUCATION, AND INFORMATION DELIVERY). THIS EXTENSION PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A NUMBER OF RREA GOALS USING PROGRAMING THAT PROMOTES HEALTHY FOREST ECOSYSTEMS THROUGH INVASIVE SPECIES MANAGEMENT, WETLAND MANAGEMENT, FOREST STEWARDSHIP, WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT, AND ENHANCING CONNECTIONS TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES AND LANDOWNER COMMUNITIES. THE STAFF OF THE CENTER WILL EMPLOY THEIR EXPERTISE AS WELL AS THAT OF OTHER EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS TO PROVIDE IMPACTFUL EXPERIENCES FOR VISITORS SEEKING CONSERVATION INFORMATION AND TRAINING. THESE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO K-16 STUDENTS, EDUCATORS, NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS, LANDOWNERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO UNDERSTAND AND ADOPT CONSERVATION PRACTICES AND TO ENGAGE IN CONSERVATION. THE FIELD-BASED, HANDS-ON NATURE OF THE PROGRAMMING PROVIDED BY THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF THE COMMONWEALTH THAT IS CURRENTLY FORESTED. THE OVERALL EXPECTATION IS THAT KSU AFFECTS THE CONSERVATION AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE, AND FUTURE BEHAVIORS OF AT LEAST 80% OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. ADDITIONALLY, AT LEAST 55 ACRES OF LAND PER YEAR WILL BE POSITIVELY IMPACTED THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRESENTATIONS RELATED TO THIS INITIATIVE. PROJECT INFORMATION METHODOLOGY THE KSU ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH CENTER (EERC) IS ON 307 ACRES OF LAND, APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES NORTH OF THE KSU CAMPUS IN HENRY COUNTY, KENTUCKY. THE EERC IS LOCATED AT THE WESTERN END OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAIN REGION, LARGELY DOMINATED BY HARDWOOD FOREST TREES WELL ADAPTED TO HILLY TERRAIN. MANY STREAMS AND CREEKS THAT DRAIN MULTIPLE RURAL AREAS CAN BE FOUND IN THESE FORESTED ACRES AND ARE PART OF THE KENTUCKY RIVER WATERSHED. THE EERC HAS A 1.25-ACRE POND, 6.5 MILES OF WALKING TRAILS, AND SITES THAT ARE USED FOR TEACHING PURPOSES AND FOR CONDUCTING RESEARCH PROJECTS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES INCLUDING AQUATIC SCIENCES, FORESTRY, BIOLOGY, AND SCIENCE EDUCATION. MANY KSU UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS CONDUCT A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLIED RESEARCH AND PARTICIPATE IN CLASSES HOSTED BY THE EERC, MAKING THIS CENTER A HIGH PRIORITY FOR FACILITY IMPROVEMENT AND LONG-TERM COMMITMENT. THE EERC IS MANAGED WITH DEMONSTRABLE ENVIRONMENTALLY-SOUND STEWARDSHIP PRACTICES AND PROVIDES A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON LAND USE AND IMPACTS ON WATER QUALITY. KSU WILL ACCOMPLISH THE PROJECT GOALS USING THE EERC AS THE PLATFORM FOR THIS PROJECT. THE EERC WILL FACILITATE K-16 AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT LEARNING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND PRESENTATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION THAT PROVIDES HANDS-ON LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT PROVIDES STUDENTS OF ALL AGES THE TOOLS TO DEVELOP BONDS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY LIVE WHILE REINFORCING THE BONDS AMONG COMMUNITIES WHICH THEY CALL HOME. IT IS A PLACE FOR LEARNERS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN IT. THESE EVENTS WILL PREDOMINANTLY INCORPORATE EXPERIENTIAL, FIELD-BASED TRAINING AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION TOPICS DESIGNED FOR LANDOWNERS, NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS, EDUCATORS, STUDENTS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC WITH INTEREST IN THESE TOPICS. PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE NOT LANDOWNERS WILL BE INTRODUCED TO COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN COMMUNITY CLEANUPS, PLANTINGS, AND INVASIVE SPECIES MANAGEMENT. KSU WILL HOST MONTHLY NATURE HIKES AT THE EERC (MAR-NOV, WEATHER PERMITTING) FOCUSING ON NATIVE FLORA. SEASONAL PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL EVENTS WILL BE HOSTED FOCUSING ON OTHER ASPECTS OF NATIVE ECOLOGY. KSU WILL IMPLEMENT UP TO FOUR PROGRAMS OR FIELD DAYS PER YEAR AT THE EERC THAT INCLUDE EDUCATION ON CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR STUDENTS AND LANDOWNERS. KSU WILL ALSO CONDUCT ONE TRAINING SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS ON HOW TO TEACH ABOUT CLIMATE VARIABILITY, PROJECTED IMPACTS, AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES. KSU WILL PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR FOREST LANDOWNERS THROUGH PROFESSIONAL TRAINING WORKSHOPS, AND PRESENTATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, UP TO SIX TRAINING WORKSHOPS OR FIELD DAYS WILL FOCUS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF HABITAT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. KSU INTENDS TO REACH A MINIMUM OF 100 STUDENTS, CITIZENS, NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS, AND FOREST LANDOWNERS. KSU WILL ALSO HOST A COMMUNITY DELIBERATION AND DIALOGUE SESSION FOCUSING ON WATER STEWARDSHIP IN THE COMMONWEALTH. THE CONFERENCE CENTER AT THE KSU HAROLD R.

THE KSRE NETWORK INCLUDES OFFICES IN ALL 105 COUNTIES, ALONG WITH FOUR REGIONAL EXTENSION OFFICES, FIVE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENCOMPASS VARIABILITY IN CLIMATE AND SOILS, FOUR SATELLITE UNITS, FOUR AGRONOMY EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND FOUR HORTICULTURE CENTERS AND EXPERIMENT FIELDS. IN ADDITION, KSRE FUNDS RESEARCH PROJECTS IN 20 DEPARTMENTS ACROSS FIVE COLLEGES. A UNIQUE FEATURE WITHIN THE K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION ORGANIZATION IS THE CLOSE ALIGNMENT OF RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. IN 1996, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION WAS FORMED BY ALIGNING THE KANSAS AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (KAES) AND THE KANSAS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE. THE STRATEGIC INTENT OF THIS ALIGNMENT WAS TO ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCY AND SYNERGY BETWEEN DISCOVERY AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. ONE ANCILLARY BENEFIT OF THIS ALIGNMENT IS THAT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO RAPID EXTENSION PROGRAMMING AND APPLICATION IN THE FIELD. THIS ALIGNMENT ALSO ALLOWS MORE FLUID COMPLIANCE WITH MULTI-STATE AND INTEGRATED COMPONENTS OF AREERA. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSING ITS EFFORTS ON FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES (CRITICAL ISSUES) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT ALL KANSANS: GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES, HEALTH, DEVELOPING TOMORROW'S LEADERS, AND COMMUNITY VITALITY. THESE GRAND CHALLENGES WERE DETERMINED THROUGH A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND DEFINE AREAS OF EMPHASIS FOR AGENTS, SPECIALISTS, AND RESEARCHERS. EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS AT THE LOCAL, REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL WORK TO DEVELOP REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE SIGNATURE PROGRAMS ALONG WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS MEMBERS THROUGH 11 PROGRAM FOCUS TEAMS \u2013 ADULT DEVELOPMENT AND AGING; COMMUNITY VITALITY; CROP PRODUCTION; FAMILY AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT; FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; FARM MANAGEMENT; HORTICULTURE; LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; NATURAL RESOURCES; NUTRITION, FOOD SAFETY AND HEALTH; AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, TWO TRANSDISCIPLINARY TEAMS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS COMPLEX ISSUES TO KANSANS - LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS AND STRESS AND RESILIENCY. THE WORK OF THESE TEAMS FALLS WITHIN THE OVERALL UMBRELLA OF THE FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CANNOT SOLVE THESE CHALLENGES ALONE. KSRE'S STATEWIDE PRESENCE LENDS ITSELF TO COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH ORGANIZATIONS, PRIVATE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY, LOCAL GROUPS, STATE AND FEDERAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES. QUALITY FACULTY DRAW BUSINESSES AND FUNDING TO K-STATE AND TO KANSAS INCLUDING: - K-STATE IS THE ONLY UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD WITH ACCESS TO A FULL CONTINUUM OF BIOSECURITY LABORATORIES LOCATED ON OR ADJACENT TO CAMPUS. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE WILL PROVIDE PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSTICS, RESEARCH, SURVEILLANCE, AND TRAINING IN DISEASE VECTOR BIOLOGY. THE LABORATORIES WILL OFFER EMERGENCY RAPID TESTING AND MANUFACTURING TO PROTECT THE NATION'S ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SUPPLY DURING A CRISIS. - KANSAS PRIDE IS DEDICATED TO SERVING COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND VOLUNTEERS IN MAKING THEIR COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK. THE KANSAS PRIDE PROGRAM IS A PARTNERSHIP OF K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION, THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, KANSAS MASONS AND KANSAS PRIDE, INC. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, LOCAL COMMUNITIES IDENTIFY WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO PRESERVE, CREATE, OR IMPROVE FOR THEIR FUTURE.

NEW YORK IS APPROXIMATELY 63 PERCENT FORESTED AND HALF OF THE STATE IS IN PRIVATE WOODLAND OWNERSHIP. THE AVERAGE PARCEL SIZE IS LESS THAN 30 ACRES, AND THE MAJORITY OF ACREAGE IS LESS THAN 50 ACRES. THE CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES DEPENDS ON MANY WOODLAND OWNERS MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS THAT SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE OUTCOMES. THE DECISIONS ARE MADE ON SMALL PARCELS BUT AGGREGATE FOR AN ACCUMULATED IMPACT. PRIVATE OWNERS LACK AWARENESS AND KNOWLEDGE TO INTEGRATE BEST PRACTICES. SPECIALISTS AND PRACTITIONERS IDENTIFY KNOWLEDGE GAPS OR SEEK TECHNICAL SUPPORT. EXTENSION EDUCATORS SEEK SUPPORT WITH COMPLEXPROBLEMS AT COUNTY AND MULTI-COUNTY SCALES. PRIVATE WOODLANDS ARE CENTRAL TO MULTIPLE DESIRED OUTCOMES THAT SUPPORT THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY, PRIVATE OWNER TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE OUTPUTS, RESILIENCE AGAINST STRESSORS OF THE FOREST, LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD, AND MOST RECENTLY AN EXPECTATION FOR INCREASED AND SUSTAINED SEQUESTRATION AND STORAGE OF CARBON AS AN OFFSET TO THE STATE\u2019S GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION TARGETS. WHILE MANY OF THESE OUTPUTS ARE COMPLEMENTARY, THEIR MUTUAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON CONSIDERATION OF MULTIPLE CRITERIA AND REFINED MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THE GOAL FOR THE FOREST ISSUE IS TO ENSURE THAT FORESTS ARE SUSTAINABLY MANAGED FOR OPTIMAL OUTPUTS OF DESIRED GOODS AND SERVICES. THE OBJECTIVES TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL ARE TO INCREASE OWNER AWARENESS OF INFORMATION, GAIN ACCESS TO TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS THAT SUPPORT THEIR INFORMED DECISION MAKING, AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS AND PRACTITIONERS BASED ON APPLIED RESEARCH. THE GOAL FOR WILDLIFE RESOURCES IS TO SUSTAIN AND ENHANCE THE BIODIVERSITY AND HEALTH OF NATIVE WILDLIFE POPULATIONS IN BALANCE WITH THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THEIR ECOSYSTEMS. THE OBJECTIVE FOR THIS GOAL IS TO USE APPLIED RESEARCH TO INFORM THE DECISION MAKING OF WOODLAND OWNERS, WILDLIFE SPECIALISTS AND PRACTITIONERS. THE GOAL FOR FOOD SAFETY AND SECURITY IS TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF LOCALLY PRODUCED FOREST-BASED FOODS, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCERS ARE FINANCIALLY AND ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE. THE OBJECTIVE FOR THIS GOAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE BEST PRACTICES, ACCESS APPLIED RESEARCH ON PRIMARY FOODS (E.G., MAPLE SYRUP) AND RELATED FOOD DERIVATIVES, AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THAT SUPPORT NEW AND ESTABLISHED FOREST-FOOD BASED ENTERPRISES. THE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN THE METHODS SECTION REFLECT A STRATEGY THAT RECOGNIZES STAKEHOLDERS ARRIVE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AWARENESS, HAVE PREFERRED AND SOMETIMES ESSENTIAL MODES OF LEARNING, AND BENEFIT FROM MULTIPLE EXPOSURES TO SIMILAR INFORMATION,OPTIMALLY DEMONSTRATED TO ALLOW THEM TO VISUALIZE THE OUTCOME. IN RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AWARENESS, OUR PROGRAM MATERIALS RANGE FROM INTRODUCTORY TO MODERATELY COMPLEX. HIGHLY COMPLEX MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS OR TECHNICAL REPORTS AND LARGELY OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF RREA. WE ADDRESS PREFERRED LEARNING MODES BY CREATING MULTIPLE OUTLETS AND FORMATS THAT RANGE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA TO FACT SHEETS TO YOUTUBE TO FIELD TOURS AND DEMONSTRATION SITES.

STRATEGIC GOAL 5 \u2013 EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN RURAL AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: IN THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA-LINCOLN (UNL) INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES (IANR), WE ARE ALL ABOUT PEOPLE AND THE FOOD, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAT SUSTAIN THEM. IANR INNOVATION IN RESEARCH, TEACHING, AND EXTENSION EDUCATION PLACES NEBRASKA ON THE LEADING EDGE OF FOOD PRODUCTION, ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, HUMAN NUTRITION, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT. COMPOSED OF THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES AND NATURAL RESOURCES (CASNR), THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH DIVISION (ARD), NEBRASKA EXTENSION, AND THE ARD AND EXTENSION COMPONENTS OF THREE DEPARTMENTS IN THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND HUMAN SCIENCES; IANR IS COMMITTED TO GROWING THE FUTURE OF NEBRASKA'S PEOPLE, BUSINESSES, AND COMMUNITIES. STRATEGIC PLANNING IS INTEGRAL TO IANR'S FUNCTION AS A LAND-GRANT INSTITUTION, AND IT PRIDES ITSELF ON WORKING AS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT ACROSS THE THREE MISSION AREAS. IANR STRIVES TO COMBINE RESEARCH, TEACHING AND EXTENSION IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY, COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT ENCOURAGES THE BEST THINKING AND EXPERTISE FROM ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TO ENSURE NEBRASKA\u2019S COMPETITIVENESS IN A WORLD OF CHANGE AND CHALLENGE. IANR UTILIZES RREA FUNDING TO SUPPORT BOTH FORESTRY AND RANGELAND RESOURCES. FORESTRY: NEBRASKA\u2019S FOREST RESOURCE EXPERIENCES AN ARRAY OF CHALLENGES POSED BY SEVERE WEATHER, LAND-USE CONVERSION, INVASIVE SPECIES ENCROACHMENT, PEST AND DISEASE SPREAD, AND THE INCREASING THREAT OF LARGE WILDFIRES. INDIVIDUALLY, ANY ONE OF THESE FORCES CAN PLACE ENORMOUS PRESSURE ON FORESTS AND THE SPECIES THAT UTILIZE TREES FOR SURVIVAL. IF ASSESSED AS AN AGGREGATE, GIVEN PREDICTED SHIFTS IN CLIMATE BY NEBRASKA RESEARCHERS, THE STATE\u2019S TREES AND FORESTS FACE PRESSURES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN OBSERVED IN MODERN HISTORY. COMMUNITY FOREST ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR CITIZENS AS NEARLY 66% OF NEBRASKANS LIVE IN URBAN, SUBURBAN OR COMMUNITY AREAS. TREES HAVE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO THEHEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IN NE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY, 470,000 ACRES OF COMMUNITY FORESTS. NE'S COMMUNITY FORESTS IMPROVE AIR AND WATER QUALITY; REDUCE NOISE POLLUTION; IMPROVE HUMAN COMFORT, HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, INCREASE PROPERTY VALUES AND IMPROVE A COMMUNITY'S \"SENSE OF PLACE.\" NE'S RURAL FORESTS INCLUDE NATIVE FORESTLAND, AS WELL AS CONSERVATION PLANTINGS, SUCH AS WINDBREAKS AND RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS. THE YIELDS OF CROPS AND LIVESTOCK INCREASE IN AREAS SURROUNDED BY TREES. TREES, PROTECT OUR WATER RESOURCES BY FILTERING SEDIMENT AND RUNOFF AND TREES PROTECT OUR RIPARIAN SYSTEMS BY REDUCING EROSION AND BY FILTERING WATER. RANGELAND: RANGELANDS OCCUPY ABOUT 46% OF NEBRASKA HAS 49.5 MILLION ACRES, THE SINGLE LARGEST CATEGORY OF LAND AREA IN THE STATE. WITHIN THE STATE, RANGELAND ECOSYSTEM TYPES ARE DIVERSE, RANGING FROM SUB-HUMID TALLGRASS PRAIRIE IN THE EAST TO SEMI-ARID SHORTGRASS PRAIRIE IN THE EXTREME WEST. OVER 95 PERCENT OF THE RANGELAND IN THE STATE IS PRIVATELY OWNED AND IS THE PRIMARY FORAGE SOURCE FOR THE STATES 6.4 MILLION BEEF CATTLE. A PRIMARY ISSUE IS THE ADAPTATION OF GRAZING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT ENHANCE OR SUSTAIN THE RANGELAND RESOURCES. NUMEROUS FACTORS, SUCH AS DROUGHT, ENCROACHMENT OF INVASIVE SPECIES (EASTERN REDCEDAR), OR LACK OF RANGELAND MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE WILL RESULT IN REDUCED RANGELAND HEALTH AND PRESENT CHALLENGES FOR LAND MANAGERS. ALTHOUGH RURAL (LANDOWNER) CLIENTELE ARE THE PRIMARY GROUP SERVED, ALL CITIZENS OF THE STATE MAY BE INDIRECTLY AFFECTED THROUGH SUCH THINGS AS WATERSHED QUALITY, RECREATION, AESTHETICS, AND THE RURAL ECONOMY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE RANGELAND MANAGERS WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS, INFORMATION, AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES NEEDED TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THEIR LANDS IN WAYS THAT SUSTAIN THE RESOURCE AND PROVIDE OPTIMUM ECONOMIC VALUE. DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES: FORESTRY: \u2022 INCREASE TREE PLANTING TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND AIR AND WATER QUALITY; ADDRESS CHALLENGES POSED BY EMERALD ASH BORER \u2022 MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATIC CHANGE THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS. \u2022 PROMOTE WOOD PRODUCTS DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER WOOD UTILIZATION OPTIONS. \u2022 IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH TO IMPROVE FOREST RESILIENCY. \u2022 ENCOURAGE LONG-TERM CONSERVATION EFFORTS TO KEEP FORESTS IN RURAL AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS \u2022 ENGAGE RURAL AND COMMUNITY LANDOWNERS ABOUT CURRENT ISSUES IN FOREST MANAGEMENT AND FOREST HEALTH. \u2022 IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF BOTH RURAL AND URBAN TREES AND FORESTS VIA OUTREACH, EDUCATION AND DIAGNOSIS OF TREE PESTS AND PROBLEMS.

CONSEQUENTLY, INTEREST IN THE PRESERVATION OF THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT IS ON THE RISE. URBAN RESIDENTS ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT ISSUES RELATED TO URBAN SPRAWL AT THE URBAN - WILD LAND INTERFACE AND THEIR EFFECTS ON RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES. HOWEVER, IN MANY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THERE IS LITTLE OR NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SUSTAINABLE URBAN FOREST STEWARDSHIP AND HEALTH. LOCATED IN THE GULF COAST REGION, LOUISIANA IS EXTREMELY VENERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS, SUCH AS SEA LEVEL RISE, SALTWATER INTRUSION, INCREASE HURRICANE FREQUENCY, AND FLOODING. THE IMPACTS ARE DISPROPORTIONALLY HIGHER TO THE LOW-INCOME UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ALONG THE COAST. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO HELP THESE COMMUNITIES IN CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP EDUCATION AND OUTREACH MATERIALS, AND DISSEMINATE TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE ON FORESTRY, ENVIRONMENT, AND RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES. THE MAJOR OBJECTIVES ARE: 1. OUTREACH AND EDUCATE THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY YOUNG GENERATIONS ON HEALTHY URBAN FORESTS AND URBAN-WILDLAND ECOSYSTEMS, 2. OUTREACH AND EDUCATE THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ON CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES, AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICES, 3: DISSEMINATE TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO ENHANCE ENVIRONMENT AND RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, AND 4: BUILDING OUTREACH AND EXTENSION CAPACITY THROUGH ENHANCED CONNECTIONS. WE WILL UTILIZE VIRTUAL/ONLINE PLATFORMS TO CONDUCT OUTREACH AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS DISTRIBUTING ELECTRONIC FLYERS, HOSTING VIRTUAL INFORMATIONAL SESSIONS, WEBINARS, DISCUSSION FORUMS, ETC. WE WILL ALSO UTILIZE FACE-TO-FACE METHODS, SUCH AS CLASSROOM VISITS, COMMUNITY VISITS, TRAINING SESSIONS, MEETINGS, WORKSHOPS, ETC., TO ACCOMPLISH THE PROJECT GOAL AND OBJECTIVES. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS THROUGH DIRECT PROJECT INVOLVEMENT. THE TARGET AUDIENCES COMPRISE OF THE LOUISIANA COMMUNITIES SUCH AS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, COLLEGE STUDENTS, FACULTY, RESIDENTS, FARMERS, COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS , GREEN ORGANIZATIONS , MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NONPROFITS WORKING ON URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY ISSUES, ARBORISTS, URBAN FORESTERS, ETC. ELECTRONIC EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR URBAN FORESTRY, ENVIRONMENT, AND RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES, AND PRINTED MATERIALS TO ENHANCE STAKEHOLDERS\u2019 KNOWLEDGE, CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS, PAPER PUBLICATIONS, ETC. WE HOPE THAT OUR PROJECT WILL INCREASE THE COMMUNITIES\u2019 AWARENESS ON URBAN FORESTRY SUSTAINABILITY, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, AND NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION; ENHANCE THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY\u2019S ABILITY IN CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION; AND INCREASE YOUNG GENERATION\u2019S INTERESTS AND THEIR DESIRE IN PLAYING AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE STEWARDSHIP.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "LA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "99064b3e-b993-8788-feb9-770afe9b9a56-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23RREAFXXXG002_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736138, "Award ID": "NI23RREAFXXXG001", "Award Amount": 76866.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-17", "CFDA Number": "10.515", "Description": "PROJECT ABSTRACT WISCONSIN IS A LARGELY FORESTED LANDSCAPE COVERING 16 MILLION ACRES, ABOUT 46% OF THE STATE'S LAND AREA. OVERALL, 57% OF THE FORESTLAND IS OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES, TOTALING 360,000 OWNERS. FOREST INDUSTRY IS VITAL TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY; THE STATE CONTINUES TO BE THE NUMBER ONE PAPER PRODUCING STATE IN THE COUNTRY, AND FOREST PRODUCT INDUSTRIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS INDUSTRY RELIES HEAVILY ON FAMILY OWNED FORESTLAND. THE WDNR ESTIMATES THAT 10% OF THE 9.1 MILLION FORESTED ACRES, HELD BY FAMILY FOREST OWNERS, WILL BE SOLD, SUBDIVIDED OR CONVERTED TO NON\u2010FOREST USE IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS. IN A SIMILAR STUDY, THE SUSTAINING FAMILY FORESTS INITIATIVE (SFFI) FOUND THE HIGHEST CONCERN REPORTED BY 56% OF ALL LANDOWNERS WAS \"KEEPING LAND INTACT FOR CHILDREN/HEIRS\". INCIDENTALLY, THE SECOND HIGHEST CONCERN WAS \"HIGH PROPERTY TAXES\". A THIRD STUDY, BY GOBSTER AND RICKENBACH (2004) LOOKED AT PERCEPTIONS OF PARCELIZATION. THE PRIMARY DRIVERS INCLUDED ECONOMIC, DEMOGRAPHIC, VALUES <(>&<)> MOTIVATIONS, GLOBALIZATION <(>&<)> TECHNOLOGY, NATURAL CAPITAL, AND POLICIES. THUS EDUCATING LANDOWNERS ON RECOGNIZING THE BEST ECONOMIC RETURN ON TIMBER HARVESTS, UNDERSTANDING HOW DIVIDING PROPERTY AFFECTS THE ECOSYSTEM, AND WHAT POLICIES EXISTS TO ASSIST WITH MANAGEMENT WILL ASSIST WITH THESE ISSUES. OUR COMPREHENSIVE FORESTRY OUTREACH PROGRAM ZEROS IN ON THESE CONCERNS. DURING FFY2023, WISCONSIN RREA PROGRAMMING WILL ADDRESS RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS STRATEGIC AND CROSS\u2010CUTTING NATIONAL ISSUES RELATING TO GOALS IDENTIFIED IN THE NIFA RREA STRATEGIC PLAN. GOAL 1\u2010 ENSURING HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS AND GOAL 3 \u2010 ENHANCING RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON WORKING FORESTS AND RANGELANDS. THE PRIMARY CROSS\u2010CUTTING ISSUES WE WILL FOCUS ON INCLUDE FISH AND WILDLIFE R ESOURCES, CLIMATE VARIABILITY, AND INTERGENERATIONAL LAND AND OTHER LAND OWNERSHIP CHANGES. THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO HELP LANDOWNERS DEVELOP FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AROUND WOODLAND ECOLOGY, HEALTHY FORESTS, TIMBER HARVEST PRACTICES AND SALES, HABITAT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT BENEFIT WILDLIFE, STRATEGIES FOR THREATS SUCH AS INVASIVE SPECIES AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY, LAND OWNERSHIP AND INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFERS, AND TO IMPLEMENT PRACTICES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE FOREST RESOURCES AND TO MEET PERSONAL MANAGEMENT GOALS. THROUGH IN\u2010PERSON CLASSES, DISTANCE CLASSES, FIELD DAYS, AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WE ARE EXPECTING TO INCREASE LANDOWNERS' AND RESOURCES PROFESSIONALS' SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO AFFECT LONG\u2010TERM CHANGES IN ACTIVE MANAGEMENT BY WOODLAND OWNERS THAT WILL SUPPORT SUCCESSION TO FAMILY MEMBERS, REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF PARCELIZATION THROUGH STABLE LAND OWNERSHIP, AND RETAIN FOREST

RANGELANDS ACROSS THE WESTERN UNITED STATES SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND ARE A KEY RENEWABLE RESOURCE SUPPORTING LIVELIHOODS OF RANCHERS AND THE ASSOCIATED LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY. RANGELAND-BASED LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION MAINTAINS NATURALLY-OCCURRING PLANT COMMUNITIES, PROVIDING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ALONGSIDE FOOD AND FIBER PRODUCTION. GRAZING MANAGEMENT DECISIONS THAT DETERMINE WHEN, WHERE, AND HOW MUCH OF THE RANGELAND VEGETATION&#39;S ANNUAL ABOVEGROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY (ANPP) IS CONSUMED BY LIVESTOCK ARE KEY DETERMINANTS OF RANGELAND HEALTH AND THE FUTURE SUSTAINABILITY OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY IN WESTERN U.S. RANGELANDS, ANPP IS HIGHLY VARIABLE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE, FROM YEAR TO YEAR, AND WITHIN A GROWING SEASON. LANDOWNERS MUST THEREFORE UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THIS VARIABILITY AND MAKE GRAZING MANAGEMENT DECISIONS THAT ACCOUNT FOR THESE DYNAMICS. IN ADDITION, CLIMATE CHANGE IS INCREASING VARIABILITY IN ANPP, MAKING IT IMPERATIVE TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS AND TRENDS IN FORAGE AVAILABILITY WHEN MAKING GRAZING MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.MANY IN THE RANGE MANAGEMENT PROFESSION CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAND AREA AND NUMBER OF GRAZING ANIMALS--THE STOCKING RATE--TO BE A PRIMARY FACTOR THAT CAN BE CONTROLLED TO ACHIEVE BOTH RANGELAND HEALTH AND RANCH ECONOMIC GOALS.
