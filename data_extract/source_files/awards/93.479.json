HEART DISEASE, DIABETES, AND STROKE ARE AMONG THE TOP 10 LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AMONG AI/AN PEOPLE. AI/AN PEOPLE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HEART DISEASE AND STROKE MORTALITY RATES THAN U.S. WHITES AND THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG AI/AN PEOPLE HAS INCREASED 158% SINCE 1990. THE ALASKA NATIVE TRIBAL HEALTH CONSORTIUM (ANTHC) IS A STATEWIDE, TRIBALLY-DESIGNATED HEALTH SERVICES ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES THE NEARLY 170,000 AI/AN PEOPLE AND ALL 229 FEDERALLY-RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE (IHS) ALASKA AREA.  PURPOSE: THE ALASKA NATIVE TRIBAL HEALTH CONSORTIUM (ANTHC) ALASKA NATIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY CENTER (ANEC) IS APPLYING FOR THE CDC-RFA-DP19-1903, GOOD HEALTH AND WELLNESS IN INDIAN COUNTRY (GHWIC) COMPONENT 3 FUNDING OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS THE TRIBAL COORDINATING CENTER (TCC) TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING RATES OF MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY FROM COMMERCIAL TOBACCO USE, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE AND STROKE; REDUCE THE PREVALENCE OF OBESITY; AND PREVENTION OF OTHER CHRONIC DISEASE RISK FACTORS AND CONDITIONS (E.G., ORAL HEALTH, DEMENTIA, COPD) IN AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVE (AI/AN) POPULATIONS. ANEC WILL ESTABLISH THE TCC TO 1) PROMOTE ACHIEVEMENTS, VALUE, AND IMPACT OF THE NATIONAL GHWIC PROGRAM THROUGH THE USE OF A  COMMUNICATION PLAN; 2) COLLABORATE WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION?S (CDC) EVALUATORS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A GHWIC NATIONAL EVALUATION PLAN (NEP); AND 3) FACILITATE THE EFFICIENT PEER-TO-PEER EXCHANGE OF CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION KNOWLEDGE?SUCH AS BEST- OR PROMISING-PRACTICES, LESSONS LEARNED, AND SUCCESS STORIES?INCLUDING NURTURING AND STEWARDING A VIRTUAL GHWIC COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE. IN THIS ROLE, ANEC PROPOSES TO PROVIDE EVALUATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT TO ALL COMPONENT 1 AND COMPONENT 2 RECIPIENTS (C1C2RS).  OUTCOMES: BY THE END OF THE 5-YEAR PROJECT PERIOD, ANEC WILL ACHIEVE THE SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPONENT 3 STRATEGY OF ESTABLISHING A TCC FOR CONDUCTING NATIONAL GHWIC PROGRAM COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES ACROSS ALL THREE C3 STRATEGIES. SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES INCLUDE: 1) INCREASED NUMBER OF PROMISING PRACTICES AND SUCCESS STORIES IDENTIFIED DEMONSTRATING A MEASURABLE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM; 2) INCREASED NUMBER OF C1C2RS USING THEIR DATA AND EVALUATION FINDINGS TO MONITOR PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING THE NOFO OUTCOMES AND TO INFORM PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS; AND 3) INCREASED PARTICIPATION AMONG C1C2RS IN A COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE. BY THE END OF THE PROJECT PERIOD THE INTERMEDIATE-TERM OUTCOMES ACHIEVED WILL INCLUDE: 1) INCREASED NUMBER OF GHWIC PROMISING PRACTICES AND SUCCESS STORIES DISSEMINATED AMONG AI/AN COMMUNITIES; 2) INCREASED NUMBER OF C1C2RS SUBMITTING DATA TO CDC TO EVALUATE THE NATIONAL PROGRAM IN AGGREGATE; AND 3) INCREASED NUMBER OF PROMISING PRACTICES, LESSONS LEARNED, AND SUCCESS STORIES IDENTIFIED, SHARED, AND IMPLEMENTED OVER TIME.
