THE PLTF PROGRAM BEGAN IN 2012 AND WAS MODELED AFTER THE VERY SUCCESSFUL TRANSPORTATION SCHOLARS PROGRAM MANAGED BY THE NATIONAL PARK FOUNDATION (NPF) THAT SERVES THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE (NPS). THE PLTF PROGRAM GIVES RECENT GRADUATES (SOMETIMES CURRENT STUDENTS) IN A TRANSPORTATION RELATED ENGINEERING, PLANNING, OR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC SERVICE. SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS ARE PLACED AT A FEDERAL LAND UNIT FACING A TRANSPORTATION ISSUE TO FACILITATE A TRANSPORTATION PLANNING OR IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT. A FELLOW IS ASSIGNED TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH STAFF AT A UNIT OR HEADQUARTERS/REGION/FIELD OFFICE. THE ASSIGNED PROJECTS HELP THE LAND UNITS DEVELOP TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS THAT PRESERVE VALUABLE RESOURCES AND ENHANCE THE VISITOR EXPERIENCE. THE PROGRAM HAS THREE GOALS, WHICH ARE TO: \"ENCOURAGE EMERGING TRANSPORTATION PROFESSIONALS TO PURSUE THEIR CAREER SERVING FEDERAL LANDS. \"PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED TRANSPORTATION EXPERTISE TO FLMA UNITS AND REGIONS TO HELP THEM ADDRESS CRITICAL TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. \"SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION FOR VISITORS TO FLMAS. THE USFWS HAS A LIMITED TRANSPORTATION STAFF (13 PEOPLE FOR 850 MILLION ACRES OF MANAGED LANDS AND WATERS) AND ONLY $30 MILLION PER YEAR TO MANAGE THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. THEREFORE, THE FELLOWS DEEP-DIVE INTO THE COMPLEX TRANSPORTATION ISSUES THAT WOULD HAVE COST THE USFWS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS, PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND TRAVEL COSTS TO COMPLETE.
