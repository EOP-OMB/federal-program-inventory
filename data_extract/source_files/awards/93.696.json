THE PROJECT IS AIMED TO TRANSFORM HOW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN THE STATE OF MONTANA IS DELIVERED, ACCESSED, AND MEASURED BY IMPLEMENTING HIGH-QUALITY PROGRAMS, PRACTICES, AND POLICIES THAT ARE RECOVERY-ORIENTED, TRAUMA-INFORMED, AND EQUITY-BASED.  THE PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS COMPLEX CHALLENGES, FROM RISING LEVELS OF DRUG OVERDOSES AND SUICIDE TO LONGSTANDING ISSUES WITH THE FRAGMENTATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE FROM PRIMARY CARE SYSTEMS.

THIS PROJECT WILL BENEFIT WORK CURRENTLY UNDERWAY BY 23 SAMHSA CCBHC GRANTEES THAT SERVED 35,000 OHIOANS IN THE PAST YEAR IN 41 OF OHIO'S 88 COUNTIES, AND BY THE FACT THAT ODM HAS EXISTING STATE PLAN AUTHORITY TO ACCOMMODATE ALL SIX CCBHC PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND COVER ALL NINE REQUIRED SERVICES. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON A) BUILDING A CCBHC-CERTIFICATION SYSTEM WHICH FULLY ENCOMPASSES SAMHSA'S CCBHC CRITERIA AND INCORPORATES EXISTING STATE PLAN REQUIREMENTS ALIGNED WITH THE MODEL; B) DEFINING AND REFINING A PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM BASED ON SOUND ACTUARIAL PRINCIPLES AND VALID EMPIRICAL DATA; AND C) SELECTING CCBHCS IN RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEMONSTRATION. OHIO LOOKS FORWARD TO ACHIEVING THESE OBJECTIVES AND WORKING WITH SAMHSA AND THE NATIONAL CCBHC EVALUATION TEAM, WITH THE GOAL OF TAKING PART IN THE NATIONAL CCBHC DEMONSTRATION PROJECT, FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL OHIOANS WHO DESERVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE (IHC).  OHIO HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF SUPPORTING SAMHSA AND CMS INTEGRATED CARE MODELS (CCBHC, PBHCI, PIPBHC, MEDICAID HEALTH HOMES) AND ENGAGING OHIO'S COLLEGES OF MEDICINE AND PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO IMPROVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER CAPACITY AND WORKFORCE TO DELIVER BEST PRACTICES. OHIO HAS SEVERAL RECENT POLICY INITIATIVES THAT STRENGTHENED THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INTEGRATED CARE. FOR EXAMPLE, A BH BENEFIT PACKAGE ESTABLISHED IN 2018 EXPANDED COVERAGE FOR EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT MODELS (E.G., ACT, IHBT), ENHANCED CARE COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT, DEVELOPED A SYSTEM FOR PEER-LED SERVICES AND PRIMARY HEALTHCARE (E&M SERVICES). OHIO'S SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER 1115 WAIVER LED TO SYSTEM CHANGES THAT IMPROVE ACCESS AND COORDINATION OF ALL AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ADDICTION MEDICINE (ASAM) LEVELS OF CARE. OHIO'S NEXT GENERATION OF MEDICAID MANAGED CARE WILL ENHANCE COLLABORATION ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS OF CARE TO ACHIEVE A SEAMLESS SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR INDIVIDUALS, PROVIDERS, AND SYSTEM PARTNERS.  THIS PROJECT WILL HAVE BROAD REACH ACROSS OHIO. PAST YEAR PREVALENCE ESTIMATES FOR OHIO BASED ON THE NATIONAL SURVEY ON DRUG USE AND HEALTH (NSDUH) WERE 24.32% FOR ANY MENTAL ILLNESS (AMI), 6.85% FOR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS (SMI) IN 2019 AND 2020 - HIGHER THAN MIDWEST REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ESTIMATES. PAST MONTH ESTIMATES WERE 24.62% FOR BINGE DRINKING, 11.72% FOR MARIJUANA, AND 3.32% FOR ILLICIT DRUG USE, SIMILAR TO REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ESTIMATES. WITHIN OHIO'S MEDICAID POPULATION AGES 19-64, 29% HAD A PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS OF AMI; NEARLY 16% HAD A DIAGNOSIS INDICATING A SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS (SMI); ABOUT 10% HAD A PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD). AMONG YOUTH WITH MEDICAID COVERAGE, AGES 5 TO 18, ABOUT 25% HAD A PRIMARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS; ABOUT 12% HAD A DIAGNOSIS AND UTILIZATION PATTERN CONSISTENT WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE. THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT, FINANCIAL SECURITY, AND LONELINESS IS THE MOST OBSERVABLE IN THE STATE'S APPALACHIAN REGION, YET OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE AND ADDRESS WORKFORCE SHORTAGES ARE NEARLY A STATEWIDE CONCERN.

ALL OF THE LISTED HPSA DESIGNATIONS ARE SPECIFIC TO MENTAL HEALTH. THE COUNTIES ARE DESIGNATED WITH ADDITIONAL HPSA DESIGNATION TYPES FOR DENTAL AND PRIMARY CARE. APPROXIMATELY 43% OF THE POPULATION WITHIN THE CATCHMENT AREA IS CATEGORIZED AS LOW-INCOME WHICH MEANS THIS PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION LIVES AT OR BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL). OF THE NEARLY 146,000 RESIDENTS LIVING WITHIN THE ENTIRE CATCHMENT AREA, APPROXIMATELY 62,000 OF THESE RESIDENTS ARE LOW-INCOME. ADDITIONALLY, 20% OF THE POPULATION LIVES IN POVERTY, 12% ARE UNINSURED, 22% CLASSIFY AS HAVING A DISABILITY, AND OVER 19% OF ADULTS HAVE NO USUAL SOURCE OF CARE.4 THE NORTH CAROLINA INJURY & VIOLENCE PREVENTION BRANCH PROVIDED THE NUMBER OF OPIOID POISONING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS WITHIN THE CATCHMENT AREA.

KENT COUNTY HAS A POPULATION OF OVER 658,000 AND IS 82% WHITE, 11% BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN, 11% HISPANIC, 3% MULTIPLE RACES, 1% AMERICAN INDIAN, AND <1% OTHER. VETERANS ARE ABOUT 4.5% OF THE POPULATION. ADULTS WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND CHILDREN WITH A SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE MAKE UP 4% OF THE POPULATION, AND 5% HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER.   BLACK ADULTS IN THE GRAND RAPIDS COMMUNITY ARE 13% MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE ADULTS TO HAVE DEPRESSION AND 25% MORE LIKELY TO REPORT POOR OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 76% OF BLACK MICHIGANDERS WITH A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER GO WITHOUT TREATMENT.   BY IMPROVING AND EXPANDING COMMUNITY-BASED MH AND SUD SERVICES LIKE MOBILE CRISIS, OUTREACH TEAMS, OUTPATIENT THERAPY, AND OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRY, THIS CCBHC-IA GRANT WILL SEEK TO REDUCE DISPARITIES THAT RESULT IN BLACK ADULTS AND MINORS GOING UNTREATED AT THE OUTPATIENT LEVEL AND MORE OFTEN BEING PLACED IN RESTRICTIVE INPATIENT SETTINGS.

TO ADDRESS THE GAP BETWEEN DEMAND AND AVAILABILITY, THE GUIDANCE CENTER HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE INCLUDING TRANSITIONING TO A SAME-DAY ACCESS MODEL FOR EVALUATIONS, STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS AND INNOVATING PROCESSES FOR IMPROVING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF QUALIFIED STAFF, AND ADDING MORE GROUP TREATMENT OPTIONS. WE ALSO AIM TO ELEVATE OUR DELIVERY OF CRISIS SERVICES BY HIRING ADDITIONAL STAFF, INTENSIFYING TRAINING, INCORPORATING ADDITIONAL MEANS FOR CONSUMERS TO ACCESS CRISIS SERVICES, AND ENHANCING COLLABORATION WITH FIRST RESPONDERS AND OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS.

THE WORK ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THOSE EFFORTS WAS SIGNIFICANT; HOWEVER, IT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. NEARLY 53% OF OUR CRISIS ASSESSMENTS ARE COMPLETED ON CLIENTS SEEN BEFORE IN CRISIS.

OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT SHOWS INDIVIDUALS IN OUR AREA CONTINUE TO FACE MANY UNMET NEEDS DUE TO THE LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED SERVICES SYSTEM, INCONSISTENT USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES, A LACK OF INSURANCE, POVERTY (WITH 10.46% OF THE POPULATION LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL), AND A LACK OF AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION.  THESE CHALLENGES ARE EXACERBATED BY A PERSISTENT SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS IN THE AREA, INCLUDING PHYSICIANS AND PSYCHIATRISTS.  THE LACK OF PSYCHIATRISTS IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE AND INTENSIFIED BY A STATEWIDE DECLINE IN PSYCHIATRIC BEDS FOR EMERGENT AND CRISIS SERVICES.

A CHNA BY A LOCAL HEALTH SYSTEM ALSO IDENTIFIES A LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS/SUPPORT SERVICES AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IN NORTH CENTRAL IOWA.  THE LACK OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IS LINKED TO A CRITICALLY HIGH SUICIDE RATE WHICH IS THE NINTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN IOWA AND THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR IOWANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 10 AND 34. FURTHER, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF  SUICIDE DEATHS SINCE 2000, GROWING FROM 288 TO 521 IN 2019, AND GROWING STILL FURTHER DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  FROM MARCH TO AUGUST 2020 ALONE, 267 SUICIDE DEATHS WERE REPORTED IN IOWA.  CONCURRENTLY, ALCOHOL-AND DRUG-RELATED HOSPITALIZATION RATES CONTINUE TO GROW.  ISSUES ARE PARTICULARLY ACUTE AMONG OUR VETERANS, WHO MAKE UP NEARLY 7.6% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION.
