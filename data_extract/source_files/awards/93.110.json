CCC IS A PRIMARY CARE CLINIC IN AUSTIN DEDICATED TO THE CARE OF CMC, A POPULATION THAT NEEDS SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND SOCIAL SERVICES. MOST OF ITS 800+ PATIENTS ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID, AND MANY HAVE LOW INCOMES AND/OR DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. SINCE 2018, CCC HAS IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES WITH SUPPORT FROM A HRSA COLLABORATIVE IMPROVEMENT AND INNOVATION NETWORK (COIIN). THROUGH THE COIIN, CCC BUILT TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH DEDICATED PARTNERS, INCLUDING TITLE V AND MEDICAID AT TEXAS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS), BLUE CROSS AND BLUE SHIELD OF TEXAS (BCBS), TEXAS PARENT TO PARENT, FAMILIES, DMS, AND OTHER PROVIDERS. CCC HAS REDESIGNED CARE FOR CMC BY ASSIGNING PRIMARY NURSES FOR LONGITUDINAL, RELATIONSHIP-BASED CARE; USING A SHARED DATA PLATFORM TO DEVELOP CARE PLANS; DELEGATING SERVICE COORDINATION FROM BCBS TO THE HEALTH HOME; AND ENGAGING PARENT LEADERS IN CQI.  HOWEVER, THERE CONTINUE TO BE MANY BARRIERS TO OPTIMAL CARE FOR CMC. THE SYSTEM IS STILL TOO FRAGMENTED AND ONEROUS TO NAVIGATE FOR FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS, WITH ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES TAKING AWAY FROM VALUABLE TIME WITH CHILDREN. PAYMENT MECHANISMS DO NOT INCENTIVIZE INTEGRATED C ARE. TECHNOLOGY IS NOT OPTIMIZED TO EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT CARE NEEDS. ALL FAMILIES OF CMC EXPERIENCE THESE BARRIERS, BUT ADDITIONAL HEALTH INEQUITIES EXIST BASED ON INCOME, RACE/ETHNICITY, AND LANGUAGE. TO OPTIMIZE SERVICE DELIVERY FOR CMC, ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENTS AT CCC, THERE MUST BE CHANGES IN PROCESS AND OUTCOME MEASURES, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, AND PAYMENT STRUCTURE.  SINCE 2016, CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES IN TEXAS MEDICAID HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN A MANAGED CARE MODEL CALLED STAR KIDS, WHICH INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS FOR FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS. IN 2021, HHS SOLICITED ALTERNATIVE CARE MODEL IDEAS TO IMPROVE CARE FOR CMC. WITH PARTNERS, CCC PROPOSED A NETWORK OF PROVIDER-LED, INTEGRATED HEALTH HOMES FOR CMC WITH TEAMS OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AS DESCRIBED IN THE ACE KIDS ACT.

TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF MONTANA\u2019S CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL COMPLEXITY AND THEIR FAMILIES, THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA AND MONTANA PEDIATRICS DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE CARE MODEL ALONG THREE DISTINCT, SYNERGISTIC LINES OF EFFORT. FIRST, THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK ENSURES THAT FAMILY VOICE AS WELL AS EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION PERMEATE AND INFORM EVERY ASPECT OF THE PROJECT\u2019S DESIGN, EVALUATION AND IMPLEMENTATION.

PROGRAM - APPROXIMATELY 3,500 INFANTS DIE ANNUALLY IN THE UNITED STATES (US) FROM SLEEP-RELATED DEATHS, OR SUDDEN UNEXPECTED INFANT DEATH (SUID). IN THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE, SUID IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH OVERALL. ALTHOUGH SUID IMPACTS ALL COMMUNITIES, SLEEP-RELATED DEATHS HAVE NOTABLE AND PERSISTENT RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES, WITH NON-HISPANIC BLACK AND AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE INFANTS EXPERIENCING A RATE TWICE THAT OF NON-HISPANIC WHITE INFANTS. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO ADDRESS SUID AND SUID-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS AND FREQUENT CONTACT WITH FAMILIES OF INFANTS, PEDIATRIC HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO MITIGATE SUID-RELATED RISK. THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS (AAP) HAS BEEN A TRUSTED AND VALUED LEADER IN SUID PREVENTION SINCE THE BACK TO SLEEP CAMPAIGN IN THE 1990S. THE AAP TASK FORCE ON SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME HAS PUBLISHED THE LEADING RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND SAFE SLEEP FOR SEVERAL DECADES, AND THE AAP DIRECTS NUMEROUS SAFE INFANT SLEEP, INJURY PREVENTION, AND FATALITY REVIEW INITIATIVES AIMED AT EQUIPPING PEDIATRIC HEALTH PROVIDERS WITH TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO IMPACT THEIR PRACTICE AND COMMUNITIES. THIS EXPERTISE PLACES THE AAP IN A PRIME POSITION TO ADDRESS SUID, PARTICULARLY AMONG POPULATIONS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MARGINALIZED AND EXCLUDED. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO REDUCE OVERALL RATES OF SUID AND SUID-RELATED RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE WILL LEVERAGE THE AAPS VAST INFRASTRUCTURE AND NETWORKS TO:1) IDENTIFY AND PROMOTE SAFE INFANT SLEEP STATE AND COMMUNITY BEST PRACTICES THROUGH A DIVERSE NATIONAL COALITION, 2) INCREASE PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS\u2019 AWARENESS, UNDERSTANDING, AND USE OF FATALITY REVIEW DATA, FINDINGS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS, AND 3) ENGAGE PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS IN ASSISTING CAREGIVERS/FAMILIES TO CREATE SAFE SLEEP ENVIRONMENTS BOTH THROUGH IMPRO VEMENTS IN DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND PARTICIPATION ON FATALITY REVIEW AND COMMUNITY ACTION TEAMS (CATS) TO ADDRESS SOCIAL SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS AND COMMUNITY-LEVEL POLICY OPPORTUNITIES. AN INITIAL ACTIVITY WILL BE TO WORK WITH NATIONAL COALITION REPRESENTATIVES TO BUILD STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT. ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE 3-YEARS WILL INCLUDE CREATING A UNIFIED, CROSS-DISCIPLINE NATIONAL COALITION; GENERATING MECHANISMS TO BRIDGE PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS WITH LOCAL FATALITY REVIEW TEAMS; FOSTERING MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH GRAND ROUND SERIES AND LEARNING COMMUNITIES; AND CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE AND ROBUST EVALUATION THAT CONTRIBUTES TO BOTH PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT AND IMPROVED OUTCOMES. REDUCING RATES OF SUID AND SUID-RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES IS A COMPLEX CHALLENGE, YET ONE THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY MET BY THE CAPACITY AND EXPERTISE OF THE AAP AND ITS EXTRAORDINARY PARTNERS, EACH OF WHOM BRINGS CRITICAL AND UNPARALLELED EXPERTISE IN SUID PREVENTION, FATALITY REVIEW, COMMUNITY IMPLEMENTATION, AND FAMILY REPRESENTATION. THE AAP IS HONORED TO SUBMIT THE CURRENT APPLICATION, REQUESTING $500,000 ANNUALLY ACROSS THE 3-YEAR PROJECT PERIOD.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code":

MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH BUREAU HAS FUNDED A REGIONALIZED SYSTEM OF CARE TO PROVIDE MULTIDISCIPLINARY SERVICES TO PERSONS WITH BLEEDING DISORDERS TO ENSURE COORDINATED SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE INDIVIDUAL\u2019S LIFESPAN AND TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO CARE TO A DIVERSE POPULATION OVER BROAD GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. IN 2012, HRSA PROVIDED FUNDING TO ATHN TO HOUSE THE FIRST NATIONAL HEMOPHILIA PROGRAM COORDINATING CENTER (NHPCC) TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL PRIORITIES, STANDARDIZE CARE ACROSS THE NETWORK AND TRACK QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME. THE NHPCC HAS SINCE BUILT A ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAINTAINED THE COLLABORATION NECESSARY FOR THE CREATION OF A COORDINATING CENTER WITH THE CAPACITY TO TRANSFORM THE SEGMENTED NETWORK OF 8 REGIONAL PROGRAMS INTO AN INTEGRATED AND COOPERATIVE SYSTEM TO IMPROVE ACCESS, QUALITY AND COST OF CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH HEMOPHILIA AND RELATED BLEEDING DISORDERS OR CLOTTING DISORDERS.

FOR DECADES, MASSACHUSETTS (MA) HAS BEEN ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF INTEGRATING EARLY CHILDHOOD EXPERTS INTO PEDIATRIC CARE TO ADDRESS THE HOLISTIC NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. WE WILL SCALE IMPLEMENTATION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS TO ASSIST WITH THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE REFORMS IN THE STATE\u2019S PROPOSED MEDICAID 1115 DEMONSTRATION WAIVER.   NEEDS ADDRESSED: THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES TWO MAIN BARRIERS TO FULL STATEWIDE ECD INTEGRATION INTO PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE: 1) INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO ECD SERVICES AND 2) FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THE MODEL. APPROXIMATELY, 15% OF MA CHILDREN THREE TO FIVE YEARS OLD HAVE AN EMOTIONAL, DEVELOPMENTAL, OR BEHAVIORAL PROBLEM, WHICH IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 13%.  WHILE OVER 60% OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN MA ARE ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE COORDINATED, COMPREHENSIVE CARE WITHIN A MEDICAL HOME, ONLY 43% LOW-INCOME INFANTS AND TODDLERS RECEIVED THE SAME CARE. IN ADDITION, LATINX PARENTS REPORT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULTY ACCESSING A REFERRAL TO DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAN WHITE PARENTS (23% VS. 9%). A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO WIDESPREAD IMPLEMENTATION OF INTEGRATED CARE IS FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN PRACTICES THAT SERVE PREDOMINATELY PATIENTS INSURED BY MASSHEALTH (MEDICAID). RECOGNIZING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND PEDIATRIC PRACTICES, MASSHEALTH HAS PROPOSED TO CREATE TIERS OF PAYMENTS IN ITS PENDING 1115 WAVIER THAT WOULD PROVIDE SUB-CAPITATED RATES ROBUST ENOUGH TO INCLUDE PROMOTION, PREVENTION, AND EARLY INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.  PROPOSED SERVICES: THE OVERALL GOALS OF TMPEC ARE TO: 1) INCREASE EQUITABLE ACCESS OF YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES TO HIGH QUALITY, CULTURALLY COMPETENT, HOLISTIC EARLY CHILDHOOD SERVICES BY BUILDING CAPACITY IN INTEGRATED PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE IN MASSACHUSETTS AND 2) DEMONSTRATE A PATHWAY TO SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH MASSHEALTH\u2019S GROUND-BREAKING 1115 DEMONSTRATION WAIVER. WE PROPOSE TO SUPPORT INTEGRATED CARE TEAMS AT 16 PEDIATRIC PRACTICE PARTNERS THAT PREDOMINATELY SERVE LOW-INCOME YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES INSURED BY MASSHEALTH. INTEGRATED CARE TEAMS WILL BE COMPRISED OF ECD EXPERTS AND FAMILY PARTNERS (CAREGIVER PEERS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE WHO PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND SUPPORT AND REFLECT THE CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE). PEDIATRIC PRACTICE PARTNERS WILL USE AN EVIDENCE-BASED MODEL (HEALTHYSTEPS, TEAM UP, OR MA LAUNCH/MYCHILD) THAT BEST MEETS THE NEEDS AND STRENGTHS OF THEIR PRACTICE AND PATIENT POPULATION. TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE TEAMS, WE WILL PROVIDE TEAM COACHING, A LEARNING COMMUNITY, SPECIALIZED FAMILY PARTNER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND TRAINING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EXPERTS FROM THE BOSTON PUBLIC HEALTH COMMISSION, THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH, THE MASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION FOR INFANT MENTAL HEALTH- BIRTH TO 6, TEAM UP FOR CHILDREN, AND ZERO TO THREE/HEALTHY STEPS.

THE OREGON PEDIATRIC IMPROVEMENT PARTNERSHIP (OPIP) HAS BEEN A CENTRAL AND KEY PARTNER SINCE 2010 IN SUPPORTING GROUND-LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION ALIGNED WITH THESE STATE POLICIES AND PRIORITIES. FOR THIS PROJECT, OPIP WILL BUILD OFF EXISTING SYSTEMS, TO LEVERAGE AND INFORM GENERAL POLICY AND PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR PRENATAL CARE AND CHILDREN BIRTH-TO-FIVE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID/CHIP, IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON HOW PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES CAN IMPROVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO A CONTINUUM OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT (ECD) SERVICES. A COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACH WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE THE CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF ECD SUPPORTS AVAILABLE IN PATIENT-CENTERED PRIMARY CARE HOMES (PCPCH), WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING THE WORKFORCE STRENGTHENING AND CARE COORDINATION NEEDS TO ENSURE HIGH-QUALITY ECD SERVICES.  THERE ARE 4 COMPONENTS TO OREGON'S APPROACH: 1. A LEARNING COLLABORATIVE WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH FOUR DIVERSE PCPCH PRACTICES IN THE PORTLAND METRO TRI-COUNTY REGION, WHERE OVER HALF OF THE CHILDREN COVERED BY OREGON'S MEDICAID/CHIP RESIDE. THIS REGION IS ALSO SERVED BY OREGON'S LARGEST COORDINATED CARE ORGANIZATION, HEALTHSHARE OF OREGON, WHICH HAS ACCEPTED RISK AND RECEIVES A GLOBAL BUDGET TO ENSURE QUALITY OF CARE FOR NEARLY 90% OF THE TRI-COUNTY PRENATAL-BIRTH TO FIVE POPULATION. THESE SITES SERVE A LARGE NUMBER OF MEDICAID/CHIP-ENROLLED CHILDREN RESIDING IN THE REGION, AND ALSO HAVE A LARGE PROPORTION OF CHILDREN IDENTIFIED AS HEALTH COMPLEX (I.E. HAVING BOTH MEDICAL AND SOCIAL COMPLE XITY). THE LEARNING COLLABORATIVE WILL PROVIDE TRAINING, IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORTS, AND DATA FOR EACH SITE, WITH GOALS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ECD EXPERTS PLACED AND TRAINED TO SERVE CHILDREN BIRTH-TO-FIVE, TO INCREASE THE QUALITY AND CONTINUUM OF ECD SERVICES OVERALL AND SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN WITH HEALTH COMPLEXITY, AND TO SHARE WITH OTHER SITES THE SUCCESSES AND BARRIERS ENCOUNTERED. THESE EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE A FOCUS ON PROMOTION OF EARLY SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL HEALTH, DEVELOPMENTAL AND SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL SCREENING, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SCREENING, AND CARE COORDINATION AND SERVICE LINKAGE. SEMI-ANNUAL IN-PERSON LEARNING SESSIONS WILL BE PROVIDED ON THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF ECD SERVICES. AT EACH SESSION, REGIONAL AND PRACTICE-LEVEL NEEDS ASSESSMENT DATA WILL BE SHARED TO GUIDE IMPROVEMENTS, FAMILIES WILL PRESENT ON THEIR PRIORITY NEEDS AND WAYS TO ENSURE A FAMILY-CENTERED FOCUS, AND LOCAL ADVOCACY AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL SHARE THE UNIQUE NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES OF HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS. EACH SITE WILL THEN RECEIVE TAILORED \"AT THE ELBOW\" SUPPORT TO GUIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED ACTION PLAN. THIS INCLUDES MONTHLY CALLS/SITE VISITS WITH THE CORE TEAM TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON PROCESS IMPLEMENTATION, THE ECD EXPERT(S) TO SUPPORT PROVISION OF ECD SERVICES WITHIN THE SITE, AND THE STAFF PERFORMING CARE COORDINATION, REFERRAL TRACKING AND LINKAGE FUNCTIONS TO SUPPORT CONNECTION TO COMMUNITY SERVICES.  2.

A SHORTAGE OF PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PREVENTS ACCESS IN RURAL AREAS. PEDIATRIC AND FAMILY PHYSICIAN PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS (PCPS), WHO CARE FOR CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE ARE BEST SITUATED TO IDENTIFY AND CONNECT FAMILIES TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. TO SUPPORT PCPS WITH A NEW STATEWIDE PROGRAM FOR TRAINING, EDUCATION, SCREENING, TELEHEALTH CONSULTATION, AND REFERRALS TO MENTAL HEALTH, WE PROPOSE THE CHILDREN OF ARKANSAS MENTAL HEALTH IN PRIMARY CARE (CHAMP) PROGRAM.  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: TO SUPPORT PCPS TO SCREEN, DIAGNOSE, TREAT, AND REFER CHILDREN OF ARKANSAS WITH A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION, CHAMP IS EXPECTED TO: 1. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PCPS TRAINED TO IDENTIFY AND TREAT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. 2. INCREASE THE CONFIDENCE OF PCPS IN STARTING MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED MEDICATIONS.   3. INCREASE THE SCREENING AND REFERRAL OF PATIENTS TO A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER. 4. IMPROVE ACCESS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN RURAL AREAS. 5. INCREASE THE USE OF TELEHEALTH FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND CONSULTATION IN PRIMARY CARE.  METHODOLOGY: CHAMP IS A PROGRAM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES (UAMS) ADMINISTERED BY ARKANSAS CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITAL ACH). CO-DIRECTORS FROM THE PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE LINES AND THE CHAMP PROGRAM MANAGER COORDINATE THE ACTIVITIES OF CHAMP WHICH ALSO INCLUDES THE PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH CARE TEAM (CHAMP TEAM) COMPRISED OF A CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIST, A PEDIATRIC PSYCHOLOGIST, AND A MENTAL HEALTH CARE MANAGER. CHAMP ENROLLS PCPS AND WILL HELP IMPLEMENT VALIDATED SCREENING OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND FACILITATE THE CONSULTATION AND REFERRAL PROCESS. GUIDED BY A NEEDS SURVEY AND FOCUS GROUPS IDENTIFYING BARRIERS TO MENTAL HEALTH IDENTIFICATION AND CONSULTATION, AN IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR PCPS WILL BE PRODUCED BY THE END OF YEAR 2 TO GUIDE FUTURE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION. THE CHAMP TEAM WILL ALSO DEVELOP A CURRICULUM FOR COMMON MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS DELIVERED THROUGH A REGULARLY SCHEDULED CONFERENCE (CHAMP SESSIONS) UTILIZING A MIXTURE OF DIDACTIC AND CASE-BASED DISCUSSIONS USING THE PROJECT ECHO PLATFORM. CHAMP CONSULTS, OFFERED THROUGH TELEHEALTH, WILL CONNECT PCPS WITH THE CHAMP TEAM TO ASSIST IN MANAGING PATIENTS' MENTAL HEALTH, INCLUDING REFERRALS. THE CHAMP CARE MANAGER WILL ACCESS AND UPDATE EXISTING STATEWIDE DATABASES TO AID IN PATIENT REFERRALS. THE CHAMP PROGRAM WILL BE EXPANDED OVER THE FOUR YEARS TO ASSURE A STATEWIDE REACH AND MAXIMUM IMPACT.     COORDINATION: THE CHAMP PROGRAM IS SUPPORTED BY THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (THE STATE TITLE V MCH SERVICES BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM) AND THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  THE APPLICATION IS SUBMITTED BY THE UAMS DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS WITH AN AGREEMENT FOR ARKANSAS CHILDREN\u2019S, A PRIVATE, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM.

ACCORDING TO THE COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES COMMUNITY PERFORMANCE CENTER, IN 2021, ACROSS COLORADO, 12,128 CHILDREN EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIATED ABUSE OR NEGLECT, WITH 26% BEING UNDER AGE 3. OF THE SUBSTANTIATED REPORTS INVOLVING THIS POPULATION, 4.9% WERE BASED ON PHYSICAL ABUSE, WHILE 92.5% WERE BASED ON NEGLECT. DURING THE SAME PERIOD, 31.8% OF ALL CHILDREN PLACED OUT-OF-HOME IN COLORADO WERE UNDER THE AGE OF THREE. NOTABLY, CHILDREN OF COLOR COMPRISED ROUGHLY 58% OF ALL CHILDREN IN OUT-OF-HOME PLACEMENT, WHILE THEY MAKE UP ONLY 45% OF THE CHILD POPULATION IN COLORADO GENERALLY. WHILE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE, JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE NOTE COMMON THEMES OF NEED AMONG INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THESE THEMES INCLUDE ISSUES OF RACIAL DISPROPORTIONALITY IN CARE, PERVASIVE NEGLECT UNDERLYING REMOVALS, AND UNDER-USE OF KIN PLACEMENTS.  KEY BARRIERS TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS INCLUDE: (1) LACK OF SUFFICIENT INFANT-MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT/SCREENING AND DELAYED REFERRALS FOR SERVICES; (2) LACK OF SPECIALTY-TRAINED INFANT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDERS, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES; (3) LACK OF TWO-GENERATION TREATMENT OPTIONS; (4) HIGH-RATES OF TURNOVER AMONG CHILD WELFARE PROFESSIONALS; (5) CHALLENGES WITH THE INITIAL PLACEMENT PROCESS, LEADING TO A GREATER NUMBER OF PLACEMENT CHANGES; (6) VISITATION SCHEDULES THAT ARE NOT ATTUNED TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS; (7) DELAYS BETWEEN SERVICE REFERRAL AND SERVICE DELIVERY; (8) LACK OF PEER SUPPORT SERVICES AVA ILABLE TO PARENTS; (9) LACK OF OVERALL KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF COURT TEAMS REGARDING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS, LEADING TO CASE DECISIONS THAT ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY INSENSITIVE; (10) THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM\u2019S PREDOMINANT, NARROW FOCUS ON CHILD SAFETY, AS OPPOSED TO WELL-BEING; AND (11) A GENERAL SETTLING INTO THE STATUS QUO OF SYSTEMS WITH PROFESSIONALS BELIEVING THAT THE WORK ALREADY BEING DONE IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEED.  RECOGNIZING THAT THE CURRENT CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IS NOT EQUIPPED TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS, RMCLC SEEKS TO UTILIZE THE SAFE BABIES COURT TEAM (SBCT) APPROACH IN ESTABLISHING A STATE-LEVEL ITC LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND EXPAND TO THREE NEW ITC SITES, IN ADDITION TO THE TWO SITES RMCLC CURRENTLY COORDINATES. IN THIS WORK, RMCLC WILL PROMOTE KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCE SHARING ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND ACROSS SECTORS THROUGH A STRONG NETWORK OF COMMUNITY COORDINATORS. THESE COORDINATORS WILL CONVENE AND FACILITATE MEETINGS WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS WHO RECOGNIZE IT IS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY\u2019S RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE, NOT ONLY THE COUNTY AGENCIES; IMPLEMENT CONSISTENT DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS TO PROMOTE CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; AND PROMOTE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IN ALL ASPECTS OF LOCAL COMMUNITY ITC SITES AND STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS BY ENHANCING THE TREATMENT PROVIDER WORKFORCE ACROSS THE STATE, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. TO THIS END, RMCLC PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH AN INFANT MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ROSTERED CHILD-PARENT PSYCHOTHERAPY PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE OF COLORADO.

IN ADDITION, A ROBUST EVALUATION EFFORT, LED BY EXPERTS FROM CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, WILL ADDRESS FIVE MAIN EVALUATIVE QUESTIONS: (1) DO CHILDREN INVOLVED WITH SAFE BABIES SPEND LESS TIME IN CARE THAN OTHER CHILDREN THEIR AGE? (2) DO CHILDREN INVOLVED WITH SAFE BABIES HAVE FEWER PLACEMENTS WHILE IN CARE? (3) DO CHILDREN INVOLVED WITH SAFE BABIES HAVE MORE INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR SIBLINGS AND PARENTS THAN OTHER CHILDREN? (4) DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS ENGAGE IN CHILD PARENT PSYCHOTHERAPY OR OTHER EVIDENCE-INFORMED BIRTH-3 INFANT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN A TIMELY WAY AND DO THEY COMPLETE THE SERVICES? AND (5) ARE PARENTS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THEIR CASE THROUGH FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS AND HEARINGS?

THE PROJECT BUDGET IS $625,000 ANNUALLY AND WILL ASSIST IN ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING PROJECT GOALS: GOAL 1: BY SEPTEMBER 2027, PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND CREATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MULTI-LEVEL CROSS-SYSTEM COLLABORATION THAT PROMOTES EQUITY AND ADVANCES THE USE OF THE INFANT-TODDLER COURT (ITC) APPROACH BY INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY TEAMS. GOAL 2: BY SEPTEMBER 2027, ESTABLISH A STATE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SYSTEM THAT PROMOTES TIMELY ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALIZED TRAUMA-INFORMED SERVICES THAT STRENGTHEN AND STABILIZE FAMILIES, RESPOND TO AND PREVENT THE MALTREATMENT OF VERY YOUNG CHILDREN, AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. GOAL 3: BY 9/29/27 INTEGRATE THE U-ITCP INTO THE EARLY CHILDHOOD UTAH (ECU) ADVISORY COUNCIL ACTIVITIES AND ALIGN THE U-ITCP GOALS AND OBJECTIVES TO THE STATE VISION FOR CHILDREN.  THE PROJECT IS ROOTED IN EQUITY AND WILL UTILIZE THE CORE COMPONENTS OF THE SAFE BABIES COURT TEAM FRAMEWORK AND EVIDENCE-BASED MODELS OF SERVICE DELIVERY FOR INFANTS, TODDLERS, AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE LEADERSHIP OF THE U-ITCP ACTIVITIES WILL BE SOLIDIFIED AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND LOCAL LEADERSHIP TEAMS. THE PROJECT WILL BE OVERSEEN BY TCCU STAFF WHICH WILL INCLUDE A PROJECT DIRECTOR AND STATE COORDINATOR. LOCALLY, THE PROJECT WILL BE FACILITATED BY COMMUNITY COORDINATORS. TO RESOLVE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS, THE PROJECT DIRECTOR AND STATE COORDINATOR WILL ENGAGE THE LEADERSHIP TEAMS IN A NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES THAT HELP THEM BUILD THE CAP ACITY TO SERVE IN THEIR ROLE AS CHAMPIONS THAT ARE VISIBLE AND UNIFIED.   THE PROJECT STRATEGIES INCLUDE EXPANDING PARENT LEADERSHIP AND INTEGRATING THE VOICE OF LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM INTO THE PROJECT AND INTO POLICY DECISIONS THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A UTAH PARTNERSHIP FOR THRIVING FAMILIES. THE PARTNERSHIP FOR THRIVING FAMILIES WILL BE COMPRISED OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE ENGAGED WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM OR THE U-ITCP. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO EXPAND UTAH\u2019S CURRENT INFANT TODDLER COURT SITES FROM ONE TO FOUR. THE LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE PAIRED WITH TRAINING, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, RESOURCES, AND SUPPORT FROM TCCU THAT EXPANDS THE USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED TRAUMA-INFORMED PRACTICES AND APPROACHES.

PIVOTAL ROLE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH LANGUAGE HAS FOR EARLY LANGUAGE AND VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT, LATER READING, AND SCHOOL PROFICIENCY, ENSURING THAT INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN LANGUAGE IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE. LANGUAGE-LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES CAN HAVE LONG-TERM ADVANTAGES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN\u2019S LANGUAGE, EARLY LITERACY, SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL OUTCOMES WHICH CAN IMPACT LATER SCHOOL AND LATER ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. ONGOING SYSTEMIC INEQUITY COMPOUNDED BY THE PANDEMIC MAY DECREASE THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME,  PARTICULARLY CHILDREN FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WHILE EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES TO ENRICH LANGUAGE-LEARNING EXPERIENCES IN HOMES AND SCHOOLS ARE AVAILABLE, MOST HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED RIGOROUSLY TO DOCUMENT THEIR IMPACT ON OUTCOMES FOR DIVERSE POPULATIONS OF INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN WHO MAY EXPERIENCE DISCREPANCIES IN ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. WITH OVER 12 MILLION CHILDREN RECEIVING CHILD CARE SERVICES, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES AND SCHOOL READINESS OF LARGE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: THIS PROJECT DOCUMENTS THE EFFICACY OF IMPLEMENTING THE PROMOTING COMMUNICATION: TOOLS FOR ADVANCING LANGUAGE IN KIDS (PC TALK), AN APPLIED, TRANSLATIONAL INTERVENTION WITH INFANTS/YOUNG CHILDREN FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ATTENDING PROGRAMS UNDER MCH TITLE V. THROUGH THIS PROJECT, WE ADDRESS MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH BUREAU (MCHB) STRATEGIC RESEARCH ISSUES: PRINCIPLE 1- INCORPORATING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH EQUITY FRAMEWORKS; ACCELERATING THE COORDINATION, TRANSLATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH AND PROMOTE THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING OF INFANTS AND CHILDREN AND BUILD THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR MCH PRACTICE AND MEASUREMENT CAPACITY. TARGET POPULATION: THIS RESEARCH WILL TAKE PLACE IN 30 CLASSROOMS ACROSS 8 MCH TITLE V AFFILIATED URBAN LICENSED CHILD CARE AWARE AND EARLY HEAD START PROGRAMS. WE  WILL RECRUIT 60 EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHERS SERVING APPROXIMATELY 200 INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES TO PARTICIPATE. PARTICIPATING TEACHERS, CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WILL REFLECT THE DIVERSE RACE, ETHNICITY,  AND LINGUISTIC BACKGROUNDS OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE PROGRAMS ARE LOCATED. PRODUCTS: THE PC TALK INTERVENTION IS A FULLY DEVELOPED NATURALISTIC INTERVENTION THAT INCLUDES A SET OF LANGUAGE-PROMOTING STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTION SUPPORT TOOLS TO GUIDE EARLY INTERVENTIONISTS, EDUCATORS, AND CAREGIVERS IN PROMOTING CHILDREN\u2019S COMMUNICATION SKILLS THROUGH INTERACTIONS ACROSS DAILY ACTIVITIES. PRODUCTS INCLUDE TESTING THE PC TALK INTERVENTION TO STRENGTHEN LANGUAGE INTERACTIONS AND BUILD THE CAPACITY OF ADULTS TO PROMOTE CHILDREN\u2019S LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. THE PC TALK INTERVENTION IS UNIQUELY SITUATED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES FOR MCH TITLE V PROGRAM AFFILIATES TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN WITH AND AT RISK FOR DISABILITIES AND CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTIC DIVERSE, DUAL-LANGUAGE LEARNERS THROUGH ACTIONABLE AND TIMELY RESULTS. EVALUATION: A CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A MIXED MODEL FRAMEWORK TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF THE PC TALK INTERVENTION. KEY MEASURES RELATED TO INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION, CHILD LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL OUTCOMES WILL BE USED TO DOCUMENT IMPACT ALONG WITH TEACHER AND PARENT SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS. MULTILEVEL INDIVIDUAL GROWTH CURVE MODELING WILL BE USED TO EXAMINE CHANGE OVER TIME OF THE REPEATED MEASURES NESTED WITHIN PROGRAMS. COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSES WILL BE USED TO MEASURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERVENTION.

BIRTH BUT REQUIRE IMMEDIATE MEDICAL TREATMENT. THE ADDITION OF NEW DISORDERS TO THE RECOMMENDED UNIFORM SCREENING PANEL (RUSP) REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE LABORATORY ASSAY(S). IT ALSO REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORRESPONDING SUPPORTING WORKFLOWS, DISORDER LOGIC AND CASE MANAGEMENT WORKFLOWS IN THE LABORATORY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LIMS).   POPULATION WIDE SCREENING AND HIGH COMPLIANCE THEREOF RELIES ON CHAIN OF CUSTODY (COC) SOLUTIONS THAT NOT ONLY ENSURES THAT ALL BABIES ARE SCREENED BUT ALSO PROVIDES EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL INVENTION MECHANISMS WHEN A SCREEN IS NOT COLLECTED OR RECEIVED TIMELY. ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATIONS OF BIRTHING EVENTS THROUGH ADMIT, DISCHARGE, AND TRANSFER (ADT) MESSAGES TOGETHER WITH THE CORRESPONDING ELECTRONIC LABORATORY ORDERS (ELO) AND ELECTRONIC LABORATORY RESULTS (ELR) NOT ONLY LAY THE FOUNDATIONS FOR EFFECTIVE COC SOLUTIONS BUT ARE ALSO THE CENTRAL ELEMENTS LAY FOR LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP (LTFU) MECHANISMS.  THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO IMPLEMENT SCREENING FOR NEW DISORDERS (FOCUS AREA 1) AND COMPLETE WORK IN PROGRESS TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTEROPERABILITY FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT ELECTRONIC ORDERING AND RESULTS REPORTING WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR COC AND LTFU MECHANISMS (FOCUS AREA 2). SPECIFICALLY, THE ACTIVITIES WE PROPOSE THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE UTAH NBS PANEL (FOCUS AREA 1) FOCUS ON ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND EXPANDING OUR SCALABLE, MULTIPLEX SCREENING PLATFORM BY MULTIPLE DISORDERS AT ONCE. THE FOCUS AREA INCLUDES THE CREATION OF AN EVALUATION SUBCOMMITTEE TO DEFINE DISORDER PRIORITIES TO DEVELOP A VETTED RECOMMENDED LIST OF DISORDERS TO POTENTIALLY ADD TO THE UTAH NBS PANEL, PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ASSAY DEVELOPMENT FOR THESE PRIORITIZED DISORDERS, VALIDATION OF THESE NEW METHODS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUPPORTING LIMS REPORTING STRUCTURES, AND ULTIMAT ELY EXPANDED SCREENING IMPLEMENTATION.  THE WORK WE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH AN INTEROPERABILITY FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT COC AND LTFU (FOCUS AREA 2) INCLUDES THE COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT ON ELO/ELR FRAMEWORK WITH THREE LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN UTAH (IHC, STEWARD, U OF U), IMPLEMENTATION OF ELO/ELR, THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A NBS WEB PORTAL, AND EXPLORATION OF ADT MESSAGE INTEGRATION. THE WEB PORTAL WOULD SERVE SMALLER BIRTHING CENTERS, CLINICS, AND MIDWIVES WHO EITHER LACK ACCESS TO AN EHR OR ARE NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT ELO/ELR IMPLEMENTATION. THE PORTAL WOULD SUPPORT NBS KIT REGISTRATION, RESULTS REPORTING AND SERVE AS A LOOK-UP TOOL FOR LTFU PURPOSES. IN ADDITION TO THE WEB PORTAL, THE ADT MESSAGE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF LTFU AND COC. OUR PROGRAM WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE WAYS TO ACCESS THIS MESSAGE AND IMPLEMENT FILTERS THAT WOULD ALERT WHEN A PATIENT PRESENTS WITH SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH A NBS DISORDER AND TRIGGER LTFU WORKFLOW.   THE PROPOSED WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS GRANT WILL BENEFIT ALL NEWBORNS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN UTAH AS WELL AS BABIES BORN IN UTAH FROM SURROUNDING STATES. THE AWARDED FUNDS WILL PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY OF THE UTAH NBS PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL  DISORDERS THAT CAN BE INCLUDED OR MULTIPLEXED IN OUR DEVELOPED MULTIPLEX SCREENING PLATFORM AND IMPLEMENT THE EXPANDED SCREENING ASSAY AND LIMS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT SUCH EXPANDED SCREENING.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THIS DUTY EFFECTIVELY, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF DISEASES WE ARE CAPABLE OF SCREENING AND THE TIMELINESS OF OUR REPORTED RESULTS.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE THREE DISORDERS ON THE RUSP FOR WHICH OUR LABORATORY HAS NOT DEVELOPED SPECIFIC SCREENING METHODS.  THESE DISORDERS ARE MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPES I AND II (MPS I AND MPS II) AND GUANIDINOACETATE METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY (GAMT). WE AIM TO DEVELOP TESTS IN PREPARATION FOR THE TIME THAT THESE DISORDERS ARE ADDED TO THE WISCONSIN NEWBORN SCREENING PANEL. THE SCREENING METHODS WILL BE COMPOSED OF ALTERATIONS OF CURRENTLY USED METHODS, AS WELL AS NEW LABORATORY DEVELOPED TESTS. BY DEVELOPING THESE ASSAYS, WE WILL FACILITATE THE ADDITION OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DISORDERS TO THE WISCONSIN NEWBORN SCREENING PANEL AND IMPROVE LABORATORY READINESS AHEAD OF THEIR ADDITION. ALSO, INCLUDING THE PROPOSED METHODS IN OUR PROTOCOLS WILL ALSO LEAVE US BETTER PREPARED FOR SCREENING OF OTHER RELATED DISORDERS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE ADDED TO THE RUSP IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION TO THE ABILITY TO SCREEN FOR A DISORDER, THE ABILITY TO REPORT RESULTS TO CLINICIANS EARLY IN THE LIFE OF AN INFANT IS CRITICAL TO OUR ROLE IN PUBLIC HEALTH. TRANSIT TIME, THE DAYS BETWEEN SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND RECEIPT AT THE TESTING LABORATORY, IS A KEY PHASE OF THE PRE-ANALYTICAL NBS PROCESS THAT IMPACTS THE OVERALL TIMELINESS OF IDENTIFYING AT-RISK NEWBORNS. WE PLAN TO DEVELOP WORKFLOWS AND ENHANCE EXISTING TRANSIT TIME REPORTS TO PROVIDE DETAILED CATEGORIZATION OF THE CAUSE(S) OF EACH TRANSIT TIME DELAY. WE WILL USE THIS DATA TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF STAKEHOLDERS AT EACH STAGE IN THE TRANSIT PROCESS, AND TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC TARGETS FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. WE AIM TO IMPROVE THE TIMELINESS OF SPECIMEN TRANSIT BY FOCUSING SUBMITTER ENGAGEMENT ON WAYS TO SHORTEN THE TIME BETWEEN COLLECTION AND SHIPMENT OF NBS SPECIMENS. IF SUCCESSFUL, WE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE THE WISCONSIN TRANSIT TIME QUALITY INDICATOR BENCHMARK FROM SPECIMENS RECEIVED WITHIN 3 DAYS OF COLLECTION TO SPECIMEN RECEIVED WITHIN 2 DAYS OF COLLECTION. BY EXPANDING THE TESTING PANEL AND REDUCING TRANSIT TIME, WE WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR NEWBORN INFANTS WITH INHERITED DISORDERS.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT, ADVANCING NORTH CAROLINA NEWBORN SCREENING SYSTEM PRIORITIES, IS IN RESPONSE TO HRSA-23-065, STATE NEWBORN SCREENING SYSTEM PRIORITIES PROGRAM (NBS PROPEL). THE GOALS OF THE NC NBS PROPEL PROJECT ARE TO IMPROVE IT DATA SYSTEMS AND DATA COLLECTION THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS TO THE NC INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, STRENGTHENING LINKAGES BETWEEN LABORATORY AND FOLLOW-UP DATA SYSTEMS, AND CREATING AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF TIMELINESS INDICTORS AND LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP DATA; ENHANCING LABORATORY AND FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES BY REFINING A COOP, REVIEWING AND UPDATING SCREENING ALGORITHMS AND CUT-OFFS, CONDUCTING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (QI) PROJECTS, AND IMPLEMENTING SCREENING FOR NEW DISORDERS; AND EXPAND FOLLOW-UP AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES WITH PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CLINICIANS AND BIRTHING FACILITIES, AND FAMILIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH EQUITY. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE NC NBS TEAM WILL WORK WITH PARTNERS AT RTI INTERNATIONAL. THE NC NBS PROGRAM AND RTI HAVE A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF COLLABORATION IN NBS RESEARCH, PILOT STUDIES, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, WHICH HAS STREN GTHENED THE NC NBS SYSTEM.

SCID IS A GROUP OF IMMUNE DEFICIENCY DISORDERS PREVENTING CHILDREN FROM DEVELOPING A FUNCTIONING T CELL LYMPHOCYTE IMMUNE SYSTEM. WITHOUT EFFECTIVE TREATMENT, CHILDREN SUCCUMB TO SEVERE OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. RECOGNITION OF SCID IN THE NEWBORN PERIOD IS DIFFICULT, AS THERE ARE OFTEN NO SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS EXCEPT THE EVENTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF A SEVERE INFECTION. THE GEORGIA PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY PERFORMS NEWBORN SCREENING (NBS) FOR SCID ON ALL INFANTS IN GEORGIA, HOWEVER, THE TIME BETWEEN IDENTIFYING A POSITIVE SCREEN, CONFIRMATORY TESTING, AND TREATMENT CAN VARY GREATLY AND IMPACT THE HEALTH OF THE INFANT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE POINTS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN TIME TO IDENTIFYING AND TREATING AFFECTED INFANTS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ADDRESS BOTH LABORATORY IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL AS CLINICAL REFERRAL, DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING.  TURNAROUND TIME FROM RECEIPT OF THE NBS ORDER UNTIL REPORTING THE RESULTS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IS IMPACTED BY THE TESTING USED AND THE DATA HANDLING PROCESSES FROM ORDER RECEIPT TO REPORTING.  LABORATORY EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF A NEW FDA APPROVED SCID SCREENING METHOD TO DECREASE FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS, WITH FEWER REPEATED SPECIMENS AND GREATER ACCURACY IN IDENTIFICATION OF AT RISK BABIES. THE LABORATORY WILL ALSO IMPLEMENT ELECTRONIC ORDERING AND REPORTING TO IMPROVE DEMOGRAPHIC ACCURACY AND RAPID DELIVERY OF REPORT DATA BACK TO PROVIDERS. MANY ABNORMAL SCID RESULTS CAN BE RESOLVED WITH A REPEAT NBS SAMPLE, BUT HIGHER RISK RESULTS SHOWING NO T CELLS REQUIRE CLINICAL CONFIRMATORY TESTING INCLUDING LYMPHOCYTE ENUMERATION BY FLOW CYTOMETRY.  OFTEN THESE CHILDREN DO NOT RECEIVE THE CORRECT TYPE OF FLOW CYTOMETRY FOR SCID FOLLOW UP.  THIS REQUIRE S HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO RECONTACT FAMILIES, WRITE NEW ORDERS, AND CHILDREN MUST RETURN FOR A NEW BLOOD DRAW.  THESE ERRORS RESULT IN DELAYS IN OBTAINING A FINAL DISPOSITION FOR THE CHILD AND FINANCIAL BURDENS ACROSS THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY FOR FAMILIES. IMPORTANTLY, THESE DELAYS CREATE AN EMOTIONAL BURDEN FOR FAMILIES AS THEY WAIT TO KNOW IF THEIR CHILD IS CRITICALLY ILL. DATA ON CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC TEST COLLECTION TYPES AND ASSOCIATED TIME POINTS WILL HELP THE GEORGIA FOLLOW UP PROGRAM TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM, IDENTIFY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT MAY EXPERIENCE MORE DELAYS OR PROBLEMS THAN OTHERS, AND PROVIDE DATA TO SUPPORT INTERVENTIONS.

IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, INDIANA\u2019S NEWBORN SCREENING PROGRAM HAS SEEN AN EMERGING NEED TO ADDRESS TIMELINESS OF SPECIMEN COLLECTION, SCREENING, AND RESULT REPORTING. IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE, INDIANA BELIEVES INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM, THE NEWBORN SCREENING LAB, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WILL REDUCE TIME DELAYS. INDIANA HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ACHIEVE INTEROPERABILITY BY PARTICIPATING IN THE HRSA FUNDED INNOVATIONS IN NEWBORN SCREENING INTEROPERABILITY PROJECT AND ECHO CALLS. INDIANA PLANS TO IMPLEMENT THE DEVELOPED INTEROPERABILITY ROADMAP TO ACHIEVE MORE TIMELY SPECIMEN COLLECTION, SCREENING, AND RESULT REPORTING.  ACHIEVING INTEROPERABILITY WILL ALSO IMPROVE SHORT-TERM FOLLOW-UP AND ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP IN INDIANA. CURRENTLY, ALL HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO MANUALLY ENTER EXCEPTIONS TO SCREENING MONTHLY INTO A DATA SYSTEM AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WHICH ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO FOLLOW-UP AND ENSURE ALL NEWBORNS RECEIVE MANDATED SCREENING. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT PROCESS INCLUDES UP TO A 45-DAY DELAY IN REPORTING AN EXCEPTION, SEVERELY IMPACTING THE TIMELINESS OF FOLLOWING-UP WITH INFANTS WHO WERE NOT SCREENED. ADDITIONALLY, ACHIEVING INTEROPERABILITY WILL PROVIDE NEWBORN SCREENING RESULTS DIRECTLY TO PROVIDERS THROUGH INDIANA HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE INTERFACES ALREADY IN USE BY PROVIDERS ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR PROVIDERS TO CHECK MULTIPLE DATA SYSTEMS FOR RESULTS.

FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF OPTIMIZING THEIR WELL-BEING AND LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES DURING THEIR ADULT YEARS. THE 10-LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN ALABAMA (AL) RESPECTIVELY ARE HEART DISEASE, CANCER, COVID-19, CHRONIC LOWER RESPIRATORY DISEASES, STROKE, ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE, ACCIDENTS, DIABETES, INFLUENZA/PNEUMONIA, AND KIDNEY DISEASE (CDC, 2022). EXCEPT FOR THE RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES, ALL THE DISEASES ARE IMPACTED BY LIFESTYLE CHOICES SUCH AS NUTRITION AND EXERCISE. POOR HEALTH DURING THE CHILD AND ADOLESCENT YEARS CONTRIBUTES TO POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AS AN ADULT, POOR QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PREMATURE DEATH.   WHEN COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE U.S, ALABAMA\u2019S CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS HAVE MORE OBESITY, AND THE PROBLEM IS BECOMING WORSE YEAR OVER YEAR. HEALTHY MEALS AND EXERCISE ARE KNOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHY WEIGHT, DECREASED CHRONIC DISEASE AND POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. YET WE KNOW THAT NUTRITION AND EXERCISE ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. CHILDREN FROM UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES STRUGGLE WITH ADEQUATE AND HEALTHY NUTRITION AND A BUILT ENVIRONMENT THAT IS OFTEN NOT CONDUCIVE FOR OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE EXERCISE. WE INTEND TO USE THE LIFE COURSE MODEL WITH A COLLECTIVE IMPACT FOCUS TO DEVELOP AN UPSTREAM PREVENTION PROGRAM TO HELP CHILDREN ESTABLISH POSITIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND INCREASE THEIR ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE.  OUR PLAN IS TO ESTABLISH A WELLNESS INITIATIVE IN TITUSVILLE THAT WILL HELP CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES LEARN HOW TO INCORPORATE HEALTHY EATING AND EXERCISE INTO THEIR DAILY ROUTINE. WE DO THIS BY ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY AND INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS WITH A MOBILE MARKET, PROVIDING NUTRITION EDUCATION WITH EVIDENCE-BASED WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED FOR MINORITY COMMUNITIES FROM THE SNAP-ED TOOL KIT, AND INCREASING ACCESS TO SAF E, AGE APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THROUGH AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT TAKES PLACE AT SIXTH AVENUE BAPTIST CHURCH, THE LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY RECREATION CENTER.
