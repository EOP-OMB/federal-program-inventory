THERE WERE TWO PREVIOUS QL2 COLLECTIONS IN 2017 AND 2018 BUT NEVER THE ENTIRE COUNTY AT ONE TIME AT QL1 DATA DENSITY. THE COUNTY HAS SEVERAL HAZARDS THAT CAN BE MONITORED VIA LIDAR GIVEN THE RECURRING INCIDENTS OF FIRE AND THE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZED DUE TO INTENSE DROUGHT CONDITIONS. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT IN THE COUNTY IN THE LAST DECADE WITH A NOTABLE INCREASE IN THE POPLUATION. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DATA TO POTENTIAL LAND SLIDE DETECTION, WATER-WAY MANAGEMENT, PERMITTING, MITIGATION PLANNING, EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL DECISIONS IS CRITICAL. SOLANO COUNTY HAS BEEN PROACTIVE ABOUT SHARING GIS DATA TO THE PUBLIC AND REGIONAL INTERESTS FOR YEARS WHICH HAS BENEFITTED THE REGION WITH AUTHORITATIVE DATA AND A COST SHARING MECHANISM BY WAY OF A REGIONAL GIS CONSORTIUM (REGIS). REGIS SUPPORTS THE AGGREGATION OF MANY SMALLER FUNDING POCKETS INTO A FUND MANAGED BY SOLANO COUNTY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT TO PURCHASE AERIAL IMAGERY AND LIDAR PRODUCTS UNDER A MASTER DATA SHARING AGREEMENT WITH THE 14 MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE REGIS SIGNATORIES.SOLANO COUNTY REGIS WILL BE FLYING A COMPLETE COUNTYWIDE QL1 LIDAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. THE COMPREHENSIVE DATA CAPTURING FOUR TIMES AS MUCH DATA AS QL2 WILL PROVIDE THE RICH CONTEXT NEEDED TO ASSESS SOLANO COUNTY WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE HIGH RISK OF FIRES AND THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS IMPACTING THE WATER SOURCES IN THE COUNTY. LIDAR DATA WILL PROVIDE RESIDENTS, PLANNERS, ENGINEERS, PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL AND OTHERS WITH A VALUABLE TOOL FOR RECOGNIZING AND COMMUNICATING RISKS AND MITIGATION ACTIONS.SOLANO COUNTY HAS SELECTED SANBORN AS THE VENDOR FOR ACQUIRING AND PERFORMING QUALITY ASSURANCE OF LIDAR DATA.

IMPORTANTLY, THE 2023 AOI INCLUDES ALL COUNTIES THAT WERE IMPACTED BY THE HISTORIC FLOODING IN EASTERN KENTUCKY THIS PAST SUMMER. ALL PARTNERS UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ACQUIRING NEW LIDAR DATA TO CAPTURE THE POSTFLOOD LANDSCAPE. THE 2023 KYFROMABOVE AREAS OF INTEREST (AOI) CONSISTS OF TWO SEPARATE FOOTPRINTS COVERING 52 COUNTIES. THE FIRST COVERS 49 CONTIGUOUS COUNTIES LISTED ON PAGE THREE OF THIS APPLICATION. ALL COUNTIES HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED HIGH-PRIORITY BY FEMA, THE KENTUCKY DIVISION OF WATER (DOW), AND NRCS AND OTHER PROGRAM PARTNERS. THIS AREA IS CONTIGUOUS TO PREVIOUS KYFROMABOVE LIDAR AOIS AND INCLUDES COUNTIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED IN THE 2010-2017 TIMEFRAME. THE AOI IS SITUATED IN EAST-CENTRAL KENTUCKY AND INCLUDES THE AREAS IMPACTED BY THE 2022 FLOODS. THE SECOND AOI CONTAINS JEFFERSON, OLDHAM, AND BULLITT COUNTIES WHICH ARE SITUATED IN CENTRAL KENTUCKY ALONG THE OHIO RIVER. ACQUISITION OF THESE COUNTIES WILL ENSURE THAT THEY MEET OR EXCEED THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. PREVIOUSLY, LIDAR DATA FOR THIS AOI WAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE KYFROMABOVE EFFORT BY LOJIC, THE GIS CONSORTIUM THAT COVERS THE LOUISVILLE METROPOLITAN AREA. NRCS INDICATES THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING  400,000 THROUGH AN IA FOR THE ACQUISITION OF LIDAR DATA. THEIR FOCUS IN THIS REGION IS REPLACING THE 2010, 2011, AND 2012 VINTAGE DATA. INTERAGENCY COOPERATION, ALONG WITH USGS BAA FUNDING FOR THE COUNTIES CONTIGUOUS TO THE NRCS AOI, WILL ALLOW FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF A LARGE FOOTPRINT IN EAST-CENTRAL KENTUCKY.
