WORK WITHIN THE AHRQ-FUNDED EVIDENCENOW PROGRAM SUGGESTS THAT SOME EVIDENCE-BASED QI STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE CVD CARE CAN BE ADAPTED AND IMPLEMENTED IN SMALL PC PRACTICES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. THE HEALTHY HEARTS FOR MICHIGAN (HH4M) PROJECT WILL BUILD ON EVIDENCENOW BY ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE COOPERATIVE AND NETWORK OF PRACTICE FACILITATORS IN MI WHO WILL SUPPORT SMALL RURAL PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE HTN AND TOBACCO CESSATION AND PROVIDE EDUCATION ON ABCS EVIDENCE. THESE EFFORTS WILL BE COUPLED WITH OPTIMIZATION OF HEALTH IT AND REMOTE MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT THROUGH TELEHEALTH TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO ACCESS AND HEALTHCARE SHORTAGES IN RURAL MI. WE HAVE CONVENED A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIVE THAT INCLUDES ALTARUM INSTITUTE, MICHIGAN CENTER FOR RURAL HEALTH, UPPER PENINSULA HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS, THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AND PHYSICIAN ADVISORS. OUR COLLABORATIVE BUILDS ON THE PRIOR WORK OF ALTARUM AND OUR MI-BASED PARTNERS, DELIVERING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SUPPORT TO SMALL PRIMARY PRACTICES, WITH THE LEARNINGS FROM A SUCCESSFUL EVIDENCENOW PROGRAM TO SPREAD EVIDENCED-BASED BEST PRACTICES AND BUILD A SUSTAINABLE PRIMARY CARE EXTENSION SERVICE IN MICHIGAN. SPECIFIC AIMS OF HH4M ARE TO: (1) CONVENE AND EVALUATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATEWIDE COOPERATIVE TO SUPPORT THE IN-CLINIC IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HH4M MODEL FOR PATIENTS WITH HTN AND PATIENTS WHO USE TOBACCO; AND (2) EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF RURAL PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT THE ELEMENTS OF THE HH4M MODEL BY IDENTIFYING FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO SUSTAINABLE IMPLEMENTATION, AND TEST WHETHER THE MODEL IMPROVES (A) BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL AND (B) TOBACCO USE SCREENING AND CESSATION IN A STEPPED-WEDGE TRIAL WITH A PILOT AND THREE WAVES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "47494177-5b18-4343-11dc-ada590414b67-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U18HS027954_7528"}, {"internal_id": 127715544, "Award ID": "U18HS027952", "Award Amount": 4407774.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-03-01", "CFDA Number": "93.226", "Description": "TENNESSEE HEART HEALTH NETWORK: IMPLEMENTING PATIENT-CENTERED PRACTICES IN PRIMARY CARE TO IMPROVE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH - ABSTRACT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) IS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF PREMATURE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN THE UNITED STATES. TENNESSEE RANKS 3RD IN THE U.S. IN CVD EVENT RATES, 6TH IN CVD MORTALITY, AND 5TH IN STROKE MORTALITY. THE STATE\u2019S HIGH PREVALENCE OF CVD IS PRIMARILY LINKED TO ITS DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF CVD RISK FACTORS INCLUDING OBESITY, DIABETES, AND HYPERTENSION, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED MODIFIABLE HEALTH BEHAVIORS, INCLUDING POOR NUTRITION, SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, AND TOBACCO USE. PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICAL HOME INITIATIVES HOLD SOME PROMISE FOR REDUCING THE BURDEN OF CVD IN TENNESSEE. BUT THESE VALUE-BASED PURCHASING ENDEAVORS HAVE BEEN INSUFFICIENT BY THEMSELVES TO SUPPORT BUSY PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES IN IMPLEMENTING PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH (PCOR) APPROACHES THAT REACH BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL DOCTOR-PATIENT VISIT. AN INSUFFICIENT PIPELINE OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS HAS MADE IT EVEN MORE CRITICAL TO IMPLEMENT TEAM-BASED CARE APPROACHES THAT EMPLOY TELEHEALTH AND LAY COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO ENGAGE PATIENTS IN BETTER SELF-CARE. YET PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR TEAM MEMBERS HAVE LITTLE TIME, KNOWLEDGE, OR RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT THESE PROVEN AND FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE PCOR EVIDENCE-BASED POPULATION HEALTH APPROACHES. THE GOAL OF THE TENNESSEE HEART HEALTH NETWORK IS TO LEVERAGE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE BY IDENTIFYING AND IMPLEMENTING APPROPRIATE EVIDENCE- BASED INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND OUTCOMES OF CVD CARE ACROSS TENNESSEE. WE WILL PARTICULARLY TARGET HYPERTENSION CONTROL AND SMOKING CESSATION AS TWO OF THE MOST POTENT CVD RISK FACTORS TO REDUCE AND/OR ELIMINATE DISPARITIES IN CVD OUTCOMES AND RISKS. WE AIM TO: 1) ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE COOPERATIVE EXTERNAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (QI) SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, 2) BUILD A NETWORK OF PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES AND RELATED STAKEHOLDERS WHO CAN UTILIZE THE COOPERATIVE AS A RESOURCE FOR QI SUPPORT, 3) DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE, MULTICOMPONENT, EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH FOR A HEART HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PROJECT TO IMPROVE DELIVERY OF PCOR AND BUILD INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT CAPACITY, 4) CONDUCT A ROBUST EVALUATION OF ALL PHASES OF THE PROJECT, 5) DISSEMINATE INTERIM FINDINGS, AND 6) INTEGRATE SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING AND DEVELOP A PLAN TO MAINTAIN THE COOPERATIVE AND ITS NETWORK OF PRACTICES AND PROFESSIONALS BEYOND THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROJECT.

INEQUITIES IN CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES REMAIN, AND IN SOME CASES HAVE WIDENED, ACROSS RACIAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, AND GEOGRAPHIC LINES. IN THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S., RATES OF STROKE, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI), DIABETES AND OBESITY ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. ACCORDING TO DATA FROM MILLIONHEARTS.ORG, ALABAMA HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF CVD EVENTS (DEATH, HOSPITALIZATIONS, ED VISITS) AMONG ALL 50 STATES. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES FOR SCREENING AND TREATMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS EXIST, IMPLEMENTATION IS OFTEN SUBOPTIMAL. MANY FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE RESEARCH-TO-PRACTICE GAP, INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL DEFICIENCIES, TIME CONSTRAINTS FOR PROVIDERS, LACK OF FEEDBACK MECHANISMS AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS, AS WELL AS CULTURAL FACTORS AND ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE. THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR REAL IMPACT IN CVD HEALTH IF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH TOOLS TO ADDRESS CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH (I.E., ASSESS AND MANAGE CARDIOVASCULAR RISKS), PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL SOUTH.

INVOLVING A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS, MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE A LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE ED UTILIZATION. YET, THE ED IS OFTEN AN INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE SETTING FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISES. INADEQUATE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS LEADS INDIVIDUALS TO SEEK CARE IN THE ED, EVEN WHEN ALTERNATE CARE SETTINGS MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS CARE (BHCC) IS A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE CHALLENGES OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ED UTILIZATION. MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITIES MAY ADOPT A RANGE OF BHCC SERVICES. THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (SAMHSA) RECOMMENDS COMPREHENSIVE BHCC AS A BEST PRACTICE, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING SIX SERVICES: EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC WALK-INS, CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAMS, ONSITE CRISIS STABILIZATION, MOBILE CRISIS STABILIZATION, SUICIDE PREVENTION, AND PEER SUPPORT SERVICES. DESPITE CALLS TO IMPLEMENT THESE EVIDENCE-BASED SERVICES, MY PREVIOUS WORK HAS FOUND THAT ONLY 6 PERCENT OF MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITIES CURRENTLY OFFER COMPREHENSIVE BHCC. IMPORTANTLY, IT IS UNCLEAR HOW ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS COMMUNITY NEEDS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES MAY INFLUENCE THE DECISION TO ADOPT BHCC SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER ACCESS TO BHCC ACTUALLY REDUCES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ED UTILIZATION. THUS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE DRIVERS OF BHCC ADOPTION AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF BHCC AT REDUCING AVOIDABLE ED UTILIZATION. AIM 1, ASSESS MARKET FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH BHCC ADOPTION, TESTS THE HYPOTHESES THAT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITIES WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO ADOPT COMPREHENSIVE BHCC IN 1) MORE MUNIFICENT (RESOURCE RICH) ENVIRONMENTS; 2) LESS DYNAMIC (UNSTABLE) ENVIRONMENTS; AND 3) LESS COMPLEX (INTRICATE) ENVIRONMENTS. THIS AIM MERGES A NOVEL DATASET ON BHCC SERVICES WITH COUNTY-LEVEL DATA ON ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. AIM 2, ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BHCC SERVICES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ED VISITS, TESTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT BHCC ADOPTION WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ED VISITS, BUT NOT PHYSICAL HEALTH ED VISITS. THIS AIM WILL UTILIZE A PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHED PANEL TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN ED UTILIZATION ASSOCIATED WITH BHCC ADOPTION. THE PROPOSED STUDY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT RIGOROUSLY MEASURES THE IMPACT OF A PROMISING, COST-EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY. THIS STUDY IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT EXTENDS THE EVIDENCE-BASE FOR BHCC SERVICES THROUGH THE USE OF MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES AND ADVANCED METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES. FURTHERMORE, THIS STUDY IS NEEDED TO INFORM POLICY DECISIONS TO EXPEDITE BHCC ADOPTION AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. FINALLY, BY EXAMINING ADOPTION/IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL OF CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE, THIS STUDY EFFECTIVELY TARGETS THE FOLLOWING HIGH PRIORITY RESEARCH AREA AS DEFINED BY AHRQ: 1) INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE BY EXAMINING INNOVATIVE MARKET APPROACHES TO CARE DELIVERY AND FINANCING; AND 2) HARNESS DATA AND TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND PATIENT OUTCOMES AND TO PROVIDE A 360-DEGREE VIEW OF THE PATIENT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "adf5ba97-e9a1-374f-72a1-40502b70df1a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R36HS029654_7528"}, {"internal_id": 160602492, "Award ID": "R36HS029568", "Award Amount": 42806.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-28", "CFDA Number": "93.226", "Description": "UNRAVELING CRISIS TEXT SERVICES: PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCES AMONG LOW-INCOME YOUNG ADULTS WITH SUICIDAL IDEATION - ABSTRACT SUICIDE WAS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG ADULTS AGED 15-24 IN 2021.

HEALTH SYSTEMS HAVE STRUGGLED TO MEET THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF YOUNG ADULTS. CRISIS TEXT SERVICES ARE FREE, ANONYMOUS, AND RAPIDLY ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES THAT CAN PROVIDE CRITICAL MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES FOR LOW-INCOME YOUNG ADULTS. IN 2020, THE LARGEST CRISIS TEXT SERVICE ORGANIZATION ENGAGED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH 844,000 TEXTERS, 30% AGED 18-24. IN JULY 2022, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED THE 988 NATIONAL SUICIDE CRISIS LINE (WHICH CONNECTS USERS TO THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE) AND VOLUME ROSE 45% IN THE FIRST WEEK OF SERVICE, DEMONSTRATING THE HIGH DEMAND FOR CRISIS TEXT SERVICE. CRISIS TEXT SERVICES CAN BE ACCESSED BY YOUNG PEOPLE WITH LOW FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHO MAY NOT ACCESS CARE BECAUSE OF RURALITY, COST, OR LACK OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR MENTAL HEALTHCARE. CRISIS TEXT SERVICES CAN LINK TO PRIMARY CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES AND CONSTITUTE A FREE RESOURCE THAT CLINICIANS CAN RECOMMEND TO PATIENTS. DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD USE OF CRISIS TEXT SERVICES, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCES USING CRISIS TEXT SERVICES AMONG YOUNG ADULTS. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOUNG ADULTS USE OR CHOOSE NOT TO USE CRISIS TEXT SERVICES DURING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS COULD IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CRISIS TEXT SERVICES.

ONE OF THE LARGEST ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS THAT WAS CREATED BY THE ACA IS THE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION (ACO), LAUNCHED THROUGH THE MEDICARE SHARED SAVINGS PROGRAM (MSSP) IN 2012. A MEDICARE ACO IS A GROUP OF DOCTORS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WHO AGREE TO WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND COST OF CARE BY PROVIDING BETTER-COORDINATED CARE TO MEDICARE FFS PATIENTS ACROSS THE CARE CONTINUUM. AN MSSP ACO\u2019S FINAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM MEDICARE IS DETERMINED BY BOTH THE ACO\u2019S COST EFFICIENCY RELATIVE TO ITS PRE-DETERMINED BENCHMARK EXPENDITURES AND THE ACO\u2019S PERFORMANCE ON MORE THAN 23 QUALITY MEASURES. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2022, THERE WERE 483 MSSP ACOS COVERING ALMOST 30% OF THE ENTIRE FFS MEDICARE POPULATION. EXISTING EVALUATIONS OF THE MSSP PROGRAM PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE PROGRAM MAY BE EFFECTIVE AT IMPROVING PROCESSES OF CARE AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND REDUCING UTILIZATION AND SPENDING. HOWEVER, NO RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF MSSP ACOS ON REDUCING THE RISK OF FALLS AND FALL-RELATED INJURIES AMONG OLDER ADULTS. ANNUALLY, APPROXIMATELY 30% TO 40% OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS AGED 65 YEARS AND OLDER EXPERIENCE A FALL, WHICH LEADS TO AN ESTIMATED $51 BILLION IN SPENDING.

HOWEVER, THERE IS A GAP IN EVIDENCE REGARDING HOW PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES CAN SUPPORT NPS TO MEET THE COMPLEX CARE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH MCCS. POOR NP CARE ENVIRONMENTS, MARKED BY LACK OF SUPPORT FOR NP PRACTICE, COLLEGIALITY BETWEEN CLINICIANS, AND AN ORGANIZATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE NP ROLE, DEPLETE ORGANIZATIONS OF FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES THROUGH BURNOUT AND TURNOVER, CHALLENGING NPS\u2019 ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH MCCS.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT STUDIES THIS QUESTION IN THE CONTEXT OF BREAST CANCER, A DIAGNOSIS WHICH 254,744 INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED IN 2018 ALONE, AND FOR WHICH MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE RECENTLY BECOME AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS. ONE OF THE EARLIEST PRECISION MEDICINE TOOLS TO REACH THE MARKET WAS A GENOMIC TEST THAT PERSONALIZED THE DECISION TO ADMINISTER CHEMOTHERAPY TO A PATIENT (ONCOTYPEDX).

HISTORICALLY, A HOSPITAL-INSURER NEGOTIATED PRICE WAS NOT EASILY OBSERVED BY ACTORS OUTSIDE OF THE NEGOTIATION. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY CREATED A BARRIER TO FULLY-INFORMED PATIENT CHOICE, POLICY RESPONSES, AND ACADEMIC STUDY. IN 2021, THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) PRICE TRANSPARENCY RULE REQUIRED HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TO PUBLICLY POST THEIR NEGOTIATED PRICES WITH ALL INSURERS. THE EFFECTS OF THIS RULE ON PRICES, MECHANISMS OF THESE EFFECTS, AND THE ENSUING CONSEQUENCES HAVE NOT YET BEEN RIGOROUSLY STUDIED. THE GOAL OF THIS POLICY WAS TO INCREASE INFORMATION AND DRIVE DOWN SPENDING. HOWEVER, PRIOR EVIDENCE AND ECONOMIC THEORY SUGGEST THAT THE EFFECTS ARE NOT CLEAR. IN CONCENTRATED MARKETS WITH PRICES SET BY NEGOTIATION, INCREASED PRICE TRANSPARENCY MAY FACILITATE COLLUSION OR LEAD TO PRICE INCREASES IN OTHER WAYS.

DESPITE A SIGNIFICANT LITERATURE ON THE EPIDEMIC, THERE IS STILL MUCH WE DO NOT KNOW. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS TWO OPEN QUESTIONS. THE FIRST IS TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF ENFORCEMENT INTERVENTIONS IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG MARKETS. UNDER THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT (CSA), PHYSICIANS, PHARMACIES, AND PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTORS WHO HANDLE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO PREVENT DIVERSION (I.E., ILLICIT USES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES). IN THE CASE OF OPIOIDS, A NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS, PHARMACIES, AND PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTORS WERE SHUT DOWN OR FACED CRIMINAL CHARGES DUE TO VIOLATING THEIR CSA OBLIGATIONS. THE EFFECTS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS ON OPIOID SUPPLY AND HEALTH ARE UNKNOWN. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL ASSEMBLE NEW DATA ON ALL FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT INTERVENTIONS RELATED TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS SINCE THE MID-2000S. THESE DATA WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH INDIVIDUAL PRACTITIONER AND FIRM-LEVEL DATA ON OPIOID SUPPLY AND USED TO CONSTRUCT A MEASURE OF EXPOSURE TO ENFORCEMENT INTERVENTIONS FOR ALL U.S. COUNTIES OVER TIME.

TO STUDY HEALTH, THE PROJECT WILL USE RESTRICTED-USE VITAL STATISTICS DATA FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS (NCHS) TO MEASURE COUNTY OVERDOSE DEATH RATES. AIM 2 WILL USE THIS DATA, ALONG WITH THE ENFORCEMENT DATA AND SAME METHODOLOGY AS AIM 1, TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF ENFORCEMENT INTERVENTIONS ON DEATHS FROM PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS, ILLICIT OPIOIDS, AND ALL DRUGS.  THE SECOND QUESTION THIS PROJECT WILL EXAMINE IS WHAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FACTORS CAN EXPLAIN CONTINUOUSLY RISING DEATHS FROM ILLICIT OPIOIDS (I.E., HEROIN AND ILLICITLY MANUFACTURED FENTANYL). ILLICIT OPIOID DEATHS HAVE RISEN ESSENTIALLY CONTINUOUSLY FOR TEN YEARS AFTER POLICY BEGAN REDUCING PRESCRIPTION OPIOID SUPPLY. AIM 3 WILL EXAMINE TWO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL THEORIES ABOUT WHY. THE FIRST THEORY IS DOWNWARD SLOPING ILLICIT DRUG SUPPLY. THIS THEORY IS THAT GREATER OPIOID USE GENERATED ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THAT THIS HAS REDUCED ILLICIT OPIOID PRICES AND INCREASED USE. THE SECOND THEORY IS ABOUT THICK MARKETS. THIS THEORY IS THAT GREATER ILLICIT OPIOID USE HAS INCREASED PEOPLE\u2019S SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH ILLICIT OPIOID USERS AND SELLERS, AND THAT THESE INTERACTIONS HAVE FURTHER INCREASED ILLEGAL OPIOID USE. THE PROJECT WILL DRAW FROM THE NCHS VITAL STATISTICS DATA, ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER DATASETS, TO TEST HOW MUCH EACH THEORY CAN EXPLAIN RISING ILLEGAL OPIOID DEATHS.

THE STANDARD MEASURE FOR PATIENT OUTCOMES AFTER STROKE IS THE MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE (MRS) WHICH HEAVILY FOCUSES ON PATIENT MOBILITY AND IS LESS DISCRIMINATING FOR OTHER DOMAINS OF HRQOL (E.G., COGNITIVE FUNCTION, DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, ANXIETY). HOWEVER, PATIENTS OFTEN HAVE COMPLEX PATIENT OUTCOMES WITH VARYING DEGREES OF ABNORMAL HRQOL ACROSS MULTIPLE DOMAINS, AND NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE HRQOL SCORES CLUSTER TOGETHER. REDUCTIONS IN HRQOL OTHER THAN MOBILITY REMAIN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, LIMITING PATIENT OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT.

THIS GROWTH WILL NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE PROJECTED GROWTH OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND FRAIL ELDERS. THE TURNOVER RATE AMONG DCWS IS ALREADY HIGH DUE TO POOR WORK CONDITIONS AND INADEQUATE COMPENSATION, WITH MORE PEOPLE LEAVING THE WORKFORCE THAN ENTERING IT. IT IS CRITICAL TO EXPLORE WAYS TO IMPROVE DCW WORKING CONDITIONS AND COMPENSATION TO PREVENT FURTHER SHORTAGES IN THE WORKFORCE. ALTHOUGH DCWS CONTRIBUTE ENORMOUSLY TO PUBLIC HEALTH, THEIR HEALTH IS PUT AT RISK DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK, LOW WAGES, AND LACK OF WORKER PROTECTIONS AND TRADITIONAL WORK BENEFITS.

TO ADDRESS THIS BARRIER, SOME STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS HAVE STARTED TO REIMBURSE FOR IPP LARC INSERTION, FOR THE DEVICE, OR BOTH OUTSIDE OF THE REIMBURSEMENT OF LABOR AND DELIVERY COSTS.

HEALTH CARE SYSTEM: EVIDENCE FROM MEDICAID CLAIMS DATA - PROJECT ABSTRACT FREQUENT USERS OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS), OR EMS \u201cSUPER-USERS\u201d, PRESENT A BURDEN TO LOCAL EMS SYSTEMS AND THE BROADER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BY CONTRIBUTING TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) OVERCROWDING AND INEFFICIENT HOSPITAL USE. DUE TO LIMITATIONS IN EXISTING NATIONAL-LEVEL DATA SOURCES AND THE HIGH LEVEL OF HETEROGENEITY IN LOCAL- AND STATE-LEVEL EMS SYSTEMS, EMS USE IS AN UNDER-RESEARCHED AREA OF THE HEALTH SERVICES LITERATURE. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED AND UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF ED AND INPATIENT UTILIZATION. APPLYING A BEHAVIORAL-ECOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK, THIS INNOVATIVE MULTI-METHODS STUDY SEEKS TO PROVIDE AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FREQUENT EMS USE AND THE BROADER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IN DOING SO, THE STUDY TEAM HOPES TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE CONTEXT-SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN FREQUENT EMS USE, MORE APPROPRIATE USE OF HEALTH CARE RESOURCES, AND LOWER COSTS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION IN HEALTH CARE RESOURCE USE, COSTS, AND OUTPATIENT NETWORK CONNECTIVITY RELATING TO SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EMS SUPER-USER POPULATION AND LONGITUDINAL PATTERNS OF FREQUENT EMS USE. THE STUDY WILL USE MEDICAID CLAIMS DATA OVER A 6-YEAR PERIOD (FY2014-19) FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (DC), WHICH IS CHOSEN FOR ITS HIGH PER-CAPITA EMS CALL VOLUME AND LOW UNINSURED RATE. INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS, HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION, AND MEDICAID COSTS FOR ADULT EMS USERS WILL BE ASSESSED USING REGRESSION ANALYSES OF DE-IDENTIFIED CLAIMS DATA (AIMS 1 AND 2). OUTPATIENT PROVIDER NETWORK CONNECTIVITY WILL BE EXPLORED USING A NETWORK ANALYSIS APPROACH APPLIED TO CLAIMS-DERIVED SHARED-PATIENT PROVIDER NETWORKS (AIM 3). THIS RESEARCH IS ESPECIALLY TIMELY, SINCE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS ENCOURAGED THE TESTING OF INNOVATIVE PAYMENT AND SERVICE-DELIVERY MODELS, SUCH AS MOBILE INTEGRATED HEALTH-COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE, ALTERNATIVE DESTINATION PROGRAMS, AND COLLABORATIONS AT VARIOUS EMS AGENCIES NATIONWIDE. STUDY FINDINGS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ACTIONABLE, CONTEXT- SPECIFIC INSIGHTS THAT CAN GUIDE MEDICAID-DRIVEN EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CARE EFFICIENCY FOR EMS SUPER-USERS IN URBAN SETTINGS.

MMC PLANS COMPETE FOR ENROLLEES BY OFFERING HIGH QUALITY COVERAGE WITH ACCESS TO DESIRABLE PROVIDERS. STATES USE COMPETITIVE BIDDING TO SELECT HIGH QUALITY, LOW-COST MMC PLANS FOR ENROLLEES TO CHOOSE FROM. PLAN CHOICE AND COMPETITIVE BIDDING CAN PROMOTE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY IN MMC IF ENROLLEES SORT INTO HIGH QUALITY PLANS AND/OR STATES ARE WILLING TO EXCLUDE LOW QUALITY PLANS FROM THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMS. BOTH THESE MECHANISMS MAY REQUIRE ENROLLEES TO SWITCH PLANS, WHICH COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT QUALITY IF PATIENTS LOSE ACCESS TO PROVIDERS OR EXPERIENCE DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR CARE DUE TO THESE TRANSITIONS. DESPITE THE LARGE AND GROWING ROLE OF MMC IN COVERING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW SWITCHING BETWEEN MMC PLANS AFFECTS HEALTH CARE QUALITY OR UTILIZATION. DATA LIMITATIONS, UNSTABLE ENROLLMENT, AND STATE- LEVEL POLICY DIFFERENCES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE EVIDENCE ON HOW MEDICAID PATIENTS\u2019 HEALTH CARE USE CHANGES AFTER ENROLLING IN A NEW MMC PLAN.

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT WHEN FACED WITH TREATING A CHILD WITH JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS (JIA), A HETEROGENEOUS CHRONIC CONDITION WITH NO KNOWN ETIOLOGY OR CURE, THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION. CLINICIANS RELY ON THEIR PAST EXPERIENCES AND LEARNINGS FROM PEERS AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION FOR JIA PATIENTS. YET DESPITE MULTIPLE FDA APPROVED TREATMENTS, ONLY 40 PERCENT OF PATIENTS WITH A POLYARTICULAR FORM OF JIA ACHIEVE A STATE OF CONTROLLED DISEASE, IT IS HARD TO TREAT. WHILE CLINICAL EXPERTISE IS INVALUABLE, RELYING ON CLINICIAN EXPERIENCE ALONE AT POINT OF CARE (POC) WHEN TREATING AN UNCOMMON (1 IN 1000 CHILDREN) AND DISABLING DISEASE WITH HETEROGENEOUS PRESENTATION AND VARIABLE TREATMENT RESPONSE MAY RESULT IN MISSING A CRITICAL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EARLY REMISSION AND SUBOPTIMAL OUTCOME. IMAGINE THE POWER OF A DIGITAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY (DHT) THAT USES REAL WORLD DATA TO INFORM EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR EVERY CHILD. BY LEARNING COLLECTIVELY FROM PAST EXPERIENCES OF A NETWORK OF PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS THAT LEVERAGE A SHARED CLINICAL DATA REGISTRY, THE DHT SYNTHESIZES, AND UPDATES KNOWLEDGE CENTERED FOR THE PATIENT AT THE POC, WHILE CONSIDERING THE VALUES AND PREFERENCES OF PATIENTS FOR SHARED DECISION-MAKING (SDM). CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO SUCH DHT AVAILABLE TO DELIVER THE PATIENT-CENTERED COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS EVIDENCE AT THE POC.  THIS STUDY AIMS TO CLOSE SUCH A GAP WITH NOVEL USER-CENTERED DESIGN TO ADAPT FOR USE AT POC AN EXISTING RESEARCHER FACING APPLICATION PACKAGE BASED ON ADVANCED BAYESIAN CAUSAL LEARNING METHODS APPLIED TO REAL WORLD ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) DATA. THIS DHT, CALLED PCATS.JIA (PATIENT CENTERED ADAPTIVE TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR JIA CARE) WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE SETTING OF A 23-CENTER LEARNING HEALTH NETWORK. IN R21 PHASE, THE STUDY AIMS TO: 1) BRING THE PCATS PLATFORM TO THE POC BY DEVELOPING A PCATS.JIA DHT THAT IS EHR SYSTEM AGNOSTIC; 2) CO-DESIGN A GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE FOR PCATS.JIA AS A PATIENT-CENTERED SDM TOOL TOGETHER WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS (PATIENTS, PARENTS, AND CLINICIANS); AND 3) PILOT TEST PCATS.JIA AS A SDM TOOL AT POC IN A SINGLE RHEUMATOLOGY PRACTICE. IN R33 PHASE, WE WILL REFINE, TEST, AND EVALUATE THE PCATS.JIA IN THREE PEDIATRIC RHEUMATOLOGY CLINICS BY 1) USING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SCIENCE AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE PRINCIPLES TO IMPLEMENT PCATS.JIA INTO THE CLINIC WORKFLOW WITH HIGH RELIABILITY; AND 2) DEMONSTRATING THAT USE OF PCATS WILL RESULT IN IMPROVED HEALTH CARE SERVICE AS REFLECTED IN MORE PATIENT-CENTERED CARE, IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND HEALTH EQUITY.  THE STUDY PROMISES TO DELIVER A NOVEL PATIENT CENTERED DHT THAT IS ROBUST, FLEXIBLE AND IMPROVES QUALITY AND EQUITY OF CARE AND TREATMENT OUTCOMES AS TESTED WITHIN THE PRACTICE OF PEDIATRIC RHEUMATOLOGY.

WHILE EFFECTIVE, QCPR COACHING IS RESOURCE AND PERSONNEL INTENSIVE, LIMITING ITS USE IN PREHOSPITAL OR COMMUNITY SETTINGS WHERE MOST CHILDREN IN CARDIAC ARREST PRESENT FOR CARE.  A NOVEL STRATEGY TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME CPR FEEDBACK WITHOUT ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL IS THE USE OF VISUAL FEEDBACK IN A MEDICAL PROVIDER'S FIELD OF VIEW THROUGH AUGMENTED REALITY (AR). AN AR FEEDBACK SYSTEM CALLED AR- CPR HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE CHEST COMPRESSION QUALITY IN REAL TIME, WITH PROMISING USABILITY AND FEASIBILITY.

MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY DECREASES BREAST CANCER-RELATED MORTALITY, BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SCREENING HAS INEFFICIENCIES AND LIMITATIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO POTENTIAL HARMS. FALSE- POSITIVE RESULTS AND WAIT TIMES FOR FURTHER EVALUATION ARE WELL-DOCUMENTED MAMMOGRAPHIC HARMS. APPROXIMATELY 10% OF ALL SCREENING EXAMS ARE RECALLED FOR DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP, OF WHICH 95% ARE FOUND TO BE FALSE POSITIVES, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN BENIGN BIOPSIES AND OVERDIAGNOSIS. THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN RECALLED FOR FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP VARIES BETWEEN 8-14%, DEPENDING ON THE RADIOLOGIST. MOREOVER, THE ANXIETY EXPERIENCED BY A WOMAN WITH A RECENT ABNORMAL MAMMOGRAM IS SIGNIFICANT. MANY WOMEN SLEEP POORLY AND STRUGGLE TO FOCUS AS THEY AWAIT A MORE DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP. GIVEN THESE LIMITATIONS OF SCREENING, OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO MINIMIZE PRACTICE VARIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH RECALLS, REDUCE PATIENT ANXIETY, AND INCREASE PATIENT SATISFACTION. WE PROPOSE TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF INTRODUCING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) SOLUTION AT THE POINT OF CARE TO (1) REDUCE THE OVERALL CALLBACK RATE, (2) INCREASE PATIENT SATISFACTION BY PROVIDING IMMEDIATE SCREENING RESULTS, AND FOR WOMEN WHO REQUIRE FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP, (3) ELIMINATE THE DELAY BETWEEN SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP. THE AI SOLUTION ENABLES IMMEDIATE \u201cONLINE\u201d INTERPRETATION OF SCREENING EXAMS IN A HIGH- VOLUME BREAST SCREENING PROGRAM.

TO IMPROVE INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY, THE AMERICAN FAMILY CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITAL WAS THE FIRST PEDIATRIC CENTER TO IMPLEMENT AN INPATIENT PORTAL (MYCHART BEDSIDE, EPIC) \u2013 A BEDSIDE TABLET APP THAT GIVES PARENTS\u2019 REAL-TIME ACCESS TO CLINICAL INFORMATION FROM THEIR CHILD\u2019S INPATIENT HEALTH RECORD. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PARENTS WANT THE PORTAL EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ACCESS TO THEIR CHILD\u2019S INPATIENT DOCTORS\u2019 DAILY NOTES, DETAILING THEIR CHILD\u2019S DIAGNOSES, TREATMENT, AND DISCHARGE PLANS. STUDIES SUGGEST ADULT OUTPATIENTS READING THEIR DOCTORS\u2019 OFFICE VISIT NOTES HAD IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF CARE AND IDENTIFIED SAFETY CONCERNS THAT RESULTED IN CHANGES IN CARE. WHETHER SHARING NOTES WOULD PROVIDE SIMILAR BENEFITS FOR PARENTS DURING THEIR CHILD\u2019S HOSPITALIZATION IS UNKNOWN. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO LEVERAGE AN INPATIENT PORTAL TO ENGAGE PARENTS AS A WAY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF CARE OF HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSED STUDY IS TO PILOT TEST BEDSIDENOTES \u2013 A NEW CAPABILITY WITHIN THE INPATIENT PORTAL TO SHARE DOCTORS\u2019 ADMISSION AND DAILY NOTES WITH PARENTS DURING THEIR CHILD\u2019S HOSPITALIZATION. TO GUIDE THE EVALUATION OF THIS INNOVATIVE HEALTH IT CAPABILITY, INVESTIGATORS WILL USE A RECOGNIZED SOCIOTECHNICAL SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK, THE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING INITIATIVE FOR PATIENT SAFETY 2.0. THIS OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THESE AIMS: 1) MEASURE THE USE, USEFULNESS, AND ACCEPTANCE OF BEDSIDENOTES, AND 2) IDENTIFY PARENT AND CLINICIAN (PHYSICIAN, NURSE) EXPERIENCES WITH BEDSIDENOTES. IN THIS SELF-CONTAINED PILOT STUDY, THE APPROACH WILL BE TO SHARE DOCTORS\u2019 NOTES WITH 40 PARENTS OF CHILDREN <12-YEARS OLD ADMITTED TO A HOSPITALIST SERVICE AT THE AMERICAN FAMILY CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITAL. MIXED METHODS (EHR AUDIT REPORTS, SURVEYS, INTERVIEWS) WILL ASSESS USE AND EXPERIENCES WITH SHARING NOTES.

THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF OUR WORK IS TO IMPROVE VALUE-DRIVEN CARE BY HELPING PATIENTS ENGAGE IN THE DECISION OF WHICH ACUTE-LEVEL CARE OPTION BEST MEETS THEIR NEEDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE WHETHER A HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT)-ENABLED SDM SOLUTION INCORPORATING EXPECTED PATIENT OUTCOMES AND PREFERENCES AND DEPLOYED AT THE POINT-OF-CARE IMPROVES PATIENT AND PROVIDER PARTICIPATION IN HAH AS A CARE MODEL. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE WILL: 1) CHARACTERIZE PATIENT, CAREGIVER, AND PROVIDER PERCEPTIONS OF THE RISK TRADEOFFS, NEEDS, AND CARE PREFERENCES FOR HAH; 2) PARTNER WITH PATIENTS, CAREGIVERS, AND PROVIDERS TO ITERATIVELY DESIGN HOSPITAL-LEVEL OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT EVALUATION AND DECISION SUPPORT (HOME-DS), A HEALTH IT- ENABLED SDM SOLUTION THAT INCORPORATES RISK-MODEL PROBABILITIES AND PATIENT AND CAREGIVER PREFERENCES; AND 3) EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING HOME-DS IN ACUTE CARE AND ESTABLISH THE ACCEPTANCE RATE OF HAH. WE WILL FOCUS HOME-DS ON ADULTS AGED 18 AND OLDER HOSPITALIZED WITH SUSPECTED PNEUMONIA, A PREVELANT CONDITION THAT HAS BEEN COMMONLY INCLUDED IN HAH MODELS. WE WILL APPLY THE PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED AND BROADLY ACCEPTED PNEUMONIA SEVERITY INDEX (PSI) AS THE QUANTITATIVE RISK SCORE INPUT FOR HOME-DS.

AND 30-50% DO NOT SURVIVE DEPENDING ON THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF SHOCK. MOST RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON RECOGNIZING SHOCK BUT HAS STOPPED SHORT OF IDENTIFYING THE CAUSE OF SHOCK. DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN CAUSES OF SHOCK SUCH AS INFECTION, HEART FAILURE, BLEEDING, DEHYDRATION, OR LACK OF STRESS HORMONE, IS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. THE COMPLEX PRESENTATION OF A PATIENT IN SHOCK AND THE MANY DIFFERENT POTENTIAL CAUSES OF SHOCK REQUIRES MANY EXPERT INTERPROFESSIONAL CLINICIANS, SUCH AS NURSES, PHARMACISTS, EMERGENCY MEDICINE, CRITICAL CARE, INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND CARDIOLOGY DOCTORS, TO WEIGH IN. YET, THERE IS NO WAY FOR THESE CLINICIANS TO ACTIVELY SHARE THEIR ASSESSMENTS, BUILD A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSE OF SHOCK, AND REACH A CONSENSUS ON TREATMENT. POOR COMMUNICATION AMONG CLINICIANS IS A LEADING SOURCE OF HARM IN ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS, YET REMAINS EXTREMELY UNDERSTUDIED. THIS APPLICATION\u2019S LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE BY ADDRESSING POOR INTERPROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS APPLICATION WILL BE TO: 1) UNDERSTAND WHY INTERPROFESSIONAL CLINICIANS DISAGREE ON THE CAUSE OF SHOCK; 2) DESIGN A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS FOR INTERPROFESSIONAL CLINICIANS TO SHARE INFORMATION, THEIR ASSESSMENTS AND BUILD A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSE OF SHOCK; AND 3) PUT INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE AND MEASURE HOW THIS SYSTEMATIC PROCESS IMPROVES AGREEMENT AMONG CLINICIANS AS WELL AS TIMELINESS AND ACCURACY OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSE OF SHOCK. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT CREATING A PROCESS, INFORMED BY THE INTERPROFESSIONAL CLINICIANS WHO WOULD USE IT, TO BRING TOGETHER ALL EXPERTS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF SHOCK QUICKLY AFTER A PATIENT SHOWS SIGNS OF SHOCK, CAN IMPROVE AGREEMENT AMONG CLINICIANS, TIMELINESS AND ACCURACY IN IDENTIFYING THE CAUSE OF SHOCK. WE WILL APPLY A VARIETY OF METHODS TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS INCLUDING MACHINE LEARNING, CRITICAL INCIDENT TECHNIQUE, USER-CENTERED DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE AND INTERRUPTED TIME SERIES ANALYSIS.

WE WILL USE A SYSTEMS ENGINEERING APPROACH (PROBLEM ANALYSIS, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENT, AND EVALUATE) TO PROACTIVELY ASSESS THE INTERPROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION WORK SYSTEM, PROCESSES, AND OUTCOMES, TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT BEFORE SAFETY EVENTS OCCUR. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO (1) CONDUCT A PROBLEM ANALYSIS OF THE INTERPROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION WORK SYSTEM AND WORK PROCESSES USED IN THE CARE OF HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN; (2) DESIGN AND DEVELOP INTERVENTIONS TO ENGINEER A SAFER, MORE EFFECTIVE, AND MORE RESILIENT INTERPROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION WORK SYSTEM; (3) IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE THE INTERVENTIONS IN THE CLINICAL ENVIRONMENT TO GAUGE REAL-WORLD IMPACT. OUR LEARNING LAB WILL BE GUIDED BY TWO FRAMEWORKS, THE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING INITIATIVE FOR PATIENT SAFETY MODEL AND THE INTEGRATED RESILIENCE ATTRIBUTES FRAMEWORK. THE PRODUCT OF THIS LEARNING LAB WILL BE A RESILIENT SYSTEM FOR INTERPROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION, ONE THAT CAN POSITIVELY ADAPT IN THE FACE OF ANTICIPATED AND UNANTICIPATED CHANGES AND MAINTAIN THE SAFETY OF CARE PROVIDED DURING THE ESTIMATED 2.5 MILLION PEDIATRIC HOSPITALIZATIONS EACH YEAR.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "75401b4c-967a-1918-9977-217d3ef9ce68-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R18HS029473_7528"}, {"internal_id": 157817272, "Award ID": "R18HS029432", "Award Amount": 499999.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-03-22", "CFDA Number": "93.226", "Description": "DISSEMINATING PCOR FINDINGS TO REDUCE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN SURGICAL STERILIZATION - ABSTRACT: THIS PROPOSAL, SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO RFA-HS-22-001, IN THE PRIORITY AREA OF \u201cIMPROVING MATERNAL HEALTH,\u201d IS PROMPTED BY LONG-STANDING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN USE OF PERMANENT CONTRACEPTION (HISTORICALLY CALLED \u201cSURGICAL STERILIZATION\u201d).

EVERY YEAR, APPROXIMATELY 6,800 AND 37,000 BLACK WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES DIE FROM LUNG CANCER AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, RESPECTIVELY. MOST BLACK WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG CANCER AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES ARE DIAGNOSED AT ADVANCED STAGES, WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MORTALITY AND GREATER HEALTHCARE-RELATED COSTS. AS SUCH, STRATEGIES TO INCREASE THE EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AMONG BLACK WOMEN ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. LUNG CANCER SCREENING WITH LOW-DOSE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (LDCT) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO RESULT IN EARLIER DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER AND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN LUNG CANCER MORTALITY IN TWO LARGE RANDOMIZED TRIALS. ADDITIONALLY, RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT LDCT SCANS CAN BE USED TO PREDICT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK. THUS, LDCT LUNG CANCER SCREENING OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AMONG BLACK WOMEN. HOWEVER, WHILE LDCT SCREENING IS RECOMMENDED BY THE UNITED STATES PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE (USPSTF) FOR INDIVIDUALS CLASSIFIED AS HIGH-RISK, CURRENT USPSTF SCREENING ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA EXCLUDE MANY BLACK WOMEN WHO ARE ACTUALLY HIGH-RISK BUT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA. IN OUR PREVIOUS STUDY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE BLACK WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH STUDY (BWHS), WE FOUND THAT OVER 66% OF BLACK WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG CANCER WOULD HAVE BEEN INELIGIBLE FOR LUNG CANCER SCREENING UNDER THE 2021 USPSTF GUIDELINES. LUNG CANCER RISK-PREDICTION MODELS CAN ACCOUNT FOR LUNG CANCER RISK FACTORS OTHER THAN AGE AND SMOKING (E.G., COPD) AND ARE A PROMISING STRATEGY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HIGH-RISK BLACK WOMEN ELIGIBLE FOR SCREENING. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH MODELS IN SELECTING HIGH-RISK BLACK WOMEN FOR SCREENING HAS NEVER BEEN STUDIED PROSPECTIVELY. GIVEN THE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR LDCT SCREENING TO INCREASE THE EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, STUDIES INVESTIGATING MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES FOR LUNG CANCER SCREENING AMONG BLACK WOMEN ARE NEEDED TO ENHANCE THE BENEFITS OF SCREENING AMONG THIS POPULATION. OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO CONDUCT A SINGLE-ARM (N=400) PILOT STUDY OF U.S. BLACK WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN THE BWHS\u2014A COHORT OF 58,973 SELF-IDENTIFIED BLACK WOMEN FROM ACROSS THE U.S.\u2014TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF LDCT SCREENING AMONG THIS POPULATION. WE WILL RECRUIT BLACK WOMEN AGED > 50 YEARS WITH ANY HISTORY OF SMOKING. WE AIM TO 1) EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF LDCT SCREENING AMONG U.S. BLACK WOMEN; 2) EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF LDCT FOR LUNG CANCER DETECTION AMONG OUR COHORT AND COMPARE IT TO U.S. BLACK WOMEN IN THE NATIONAL LUNG SCREENING TRIAL (HISTORICAL CONTROL), AND 3) VALIDATE A DEEP LEARNING IMAGE ANALYSIS PIPELINE FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE DETECTION AMONG OUR COHORT. THE FINDINGS OF THIS PILOT STUDY WILL PROVIDE A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR A LARGE-SCALE STUDY THAT FURTHER EVALUATES THE OPTIMAL RISK-BASED SCREENING STRATEGIES TO SELECT HIGH-RISK BLACK WOMEN FOR LUNG CANCER SCREENING.

OUTPATIENT AND INPATIENT SETTINGS HAVE SIMILAR RATES OF DIAGNOSTIC HARM. INTERACTIONS WITHIN AND BETWEEN CLINICAL TEAMS AND SETTINGS MAY EITHER CREATE RESILIENCE OR INCREASE RISKS FOR FAILURE. RESILIENCE ENGINEERING, OR SAFETY II, IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT THAT SAFETY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF ADAPTATIONS TO THE CHANGING CONDITIONS OF A SYSTEM\u2019S FUNCTION. ROBUST COMMUNICATION SUPPORTS A SHARED MENTAL MODEL THAT MAY CREATE DIAGNOSTIC RESILIENCE. CURRENTLY, CLINICIAN-PATIENT/FAMILY COMMUNICATION ALONG THE DIAGNOSTIC JOURNEY IS HAPHAZARD. FOR EXAMPLE, PEDIATRICIANS CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO TELL PARENTS ABOUT \u201cRED FLAGS\u201d WHICH ARE SIGNS OF A SERIOUS COMPLICATION REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. AMONG CHILDREN WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS AT HOME, WE FOUND THAT 14% HAD SERIOUS DIAGNOSTIC DELAYS CAUSED BY PARENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF INSTRUCTIONS. PEDIATRIC DIAGNOSTIC SAFETY IS UNDERSTUDIED, AND OVERALL RATES AND TYPES OF OUTPATIENT PEDIATRIC DIAGNOSTIC ERRORS IS UNKNOWN. TO SUPPORT ROBUST COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILIES OF HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN, WE DEVELOPED A STRUCTURED COMMUNICATION INTERVENTION (PFC I-PASS) WHICH REDUCES MEDICAL ERRORS BY 38%. I-PASS HAS BEEN PILOT TESTED FOR USE DURING HOSPITAL DISCHARGE WITH SIMILAR SUCCESS. SECONDARY ANALYSES SUGGESTS THAT I-PASS MAY BE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING DIAGNOSTIC ERRORS. PFC I-PASS HAS NOT BEEN USED IN THE OUTPATIENT SETTING AND ITS IMPACT ON DIAGNOSTIC SAFETY HAS NOT BEEN TESTED. AMONG CHILDREN WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS, WE AIM TO: 1. CHARACTERIZE THE DIAGNOSTIC JOURNEY, FOCUSING ON SUCCESSES, ERRORS, AND PATIENT/FAMILY AND CLINICIAN COMMUNICATION; 2.

THUS, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR WELL-DESIGNED CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS) TOOLS TO ASSIST CLINICIANS WITH ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS AND APPROPRIATE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH PNEUMONIA. INTERMOUNTAIN HEALTHCARE DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED REAL-TIME ELECTRONIC CDS (CALLED EPNA) EMBEDDED IN THE CERNER ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) ACROSS 20 ADULT HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. EPNA GATHERS REAL- TIME AND HISTORICAL DATA FROM THE EHR COMBINED WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCESSING OF CHEST IMAGES (CHEXED) TO GUIDE PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS, RISK STRATIFICATION, SITE OF CARE, RISK OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE, AND TREATMENT. EPNA SMOOTHS TRANSITIONS OF CARE BETWEEN CLINICIANS. OUR WORK INCORPORATES THE FIVE RIGHTS OF CDS TO OPTIMIZE THE TECHNOLOGY\u2019S STRENGTHS IN THE CLINICAL ENVIRONMENT. TWO CONTROLLED STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT EPNA INCREASES GUIDELINE-RECOMMENDED, BEST PRACTICE CARE AND DECREASES 30-DAY ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY IN ADULTS WITH PNEUMONIA. EPNA IS READY TO BE DEPLOYED TO ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS WITH DISTINCT PATIENT POPULATIONS AND EHRS. HOWEVER, SILOED EHRS LIMIT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED WITHIN ONE VENDOR FROM BEING SHARED WITH OTHERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ENABLE BROAD DISSEMINATION OF EPNA BY OPTIMIZING ITS INTEROPERABILITY, SCALABILITY, AND USABILITY. ACCORDINGLY, WE AIM TO (1) DEVELOP A SMART ON FHIR EPNA APPLICATION CAPABLE OF INTERFACING WITH BOTH THE CERNER AND EPIC EMRS AND CONDUCT A FORMATIVE EVALUATION THROUGH AN ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS. WE WILL RAPIDLY REFINE AND VALIDATE THE NEW EPNA APPLICATION. (2) ENGAGE PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS TO INFORM THE PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS OF EPNA\u2019S CLINICAL INTERFACE. THE PROJECT WILL INCORPORATE FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDER CLINICIANS, ADMINISTRATORS, AND PATIENTS TO UNDERSTAND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS IN A NOVEL GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC ENVIRONMENT. (3) EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF EPNA THROUGH A PILOT IMPLEMENTATION TRIAL GUIDED BY THE RE-AIM QUEST FRAMEWORK.

DUE IN PART TO THE COMPLEXITY OF CALCULATING AND CONSIDERING SUCH PATIENT-SPECIFIC RISK PROFILES IN BUSY CLINICAL SETTINGS, LESS THAN 5% OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS RECEIVE THE SCREENING EVERY YEAR. TO ADDRESS THIS URGENT NEED, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A TOOL KNOWN AS DECISION PRECISION+ THAT ANALYZES PATIENTS\u2019 ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS), PROMPTS DOCTORS TO CONSIDER LUNG CANCER SCREENING FOR ELIGIBLE PATIENTS, AND PROVIDES DOCTORS WITH INDIVIDUALLY- TAILORED INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND HARMS OF LUNG CANCER SCREENING.

THIS RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE COSTS TO OUR ALREADY STRAINED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, SINCE HOSPITALIZATIONS RESULT IN 70% OF YEARLY HF MANAGEMENT COSTS. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF HF READMISSION IS LACK OF CHRONIC MEDICATION OPTIMIZATION.

THESE UNSAFE E-PRESCRIPTION TRANSACTIONS ARE RESULTING IN DANGEROUS MEDICATION ERRORS THAT MAY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT PATIENT HARM. TO SYSTEMATICALLY IDENTIFY UNSAFE E-PRESCRIPTION TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SYSTEM, CALLED SAVE-RX, THAT USES E-PRESCRIPTION TRANSACTION DATA TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY CASES WHERE THE NDC PRESCRIBED DOES NOT MATCH EITHER THE FREE-TEXT DRUG DESCRIPTION (I.E., AN E-PRESCRIBING ERROR) OR THE NDC OF THE MEDICATION DISPENSED BY THE PHARMACY.

A CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS) TOOL IS NEEDED TO QUICKLY SYNTHESIZE PATIENT-SPECIFIC DATA FROM THE EHR TO PROMOTE THE USE OF PATIENT-CENTERED OPIOID DISCHARGE CPGS. TOWARD THIS GOAL, THREE RECENT STUDIES PROVIDE A STRONG CLINICAL RATIONALE THAT INPATIENT OPIOID USE THE DAY BEFORE DISCHARGE AFFORDS A SOUND PROXY FOR INDIVIDUAL PAIN EXPERIENCE AND PAIN TOLERANCE AT DISCHARGE TO GUIDE PATIENT- CENTERED POST-DISCHARGE OPIOID PRESCRIBING. SURGEONS IN THE GENERAL SURGERY DEPARTMENT AT PRISMA HEALTH IN SOUTH CAROLINA USED THIS RATIONALE TO DEVELOP A PATIENT-CENTERED OPIOID DISCHARGE CPG THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THEIR DEPARTMENT IN MARCH 2018. THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WITH CPG-COMPLIANT OPIOID DISCHARGE PRESCRIPTIONS INCREASED FROM 10% TO 25.8% AFTER IMPLEMENTATION,59 THE DEPARTMENT-WIDE AVERAGE OPIOID DISCHARGE LEVEL FELL, AND THE GENERAL SURGEONS ANECDOTALLY FOUND LITTLE NEGATIVE PATIENT RESPONSE FROM THESE REDUCTIONS. DESPITE THESE POSITIVE RESULTS, GENERAL SURGEONS REPORTED THAT THE EXTRA TIME REQUIRED TO APPLY THE CPG WITHIN A BUSY PRACTICE LIMITED ITS BROADER USE WHICH REFLECTS FINDINGS IN THE LITERATURE. CURRENTLY, THE PATIENT-CENTERED CPG REQUIRES PROVIDERS TO PERFORM A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF PATIENT CHARTS BY HAND THAT CAN ADD 5-10 MINUTES PER PATIENT TO THE DISCHARGE PROCESS. IN ADDITION, WITH ONLY ANECDOTE AVAILABLE, THE EVIDENCE ON PATIENT OUTCOMES FROM USE OF THE PATIENT-CENTERED CPG IS NOT DEFINITIVE. WE BELIEVE THAT A PATIENT-CENTERED OPIOID PRESCRIBING TOOL (PCOPT) THAT IMMEDIATELY INCORPORATES PATIENT- SPECIFIC INFORMATION FROM EHR INTO THE DISCHARGE PROCESS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PATIENT- CENTERED OPIOID DISCHARGE CPG. IN ADDITION, WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE PCOPT USING AN EFFECTIVENESS-IMPLEMENTATION HYBRID TYPE II STUDY DESIGN TO YIELD DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF THE PATIENT-CENTERED CPG ON PATIENT OUTCOMES ON OUTCOMES USING ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA PATIENTS WITH A LOWER- EXTREMITY FRACTURE.

DESPITE THIS, ANTIBIOTICS ARE MISUSED IN NEONATES AT ALARMING RATES AND REMAIN THE MOST-PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS IN THE NURSERY. ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMS (ASPS) CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ANTIBIOTIC EXPOSURE BUT REQUIRE SPECIALIST SUPPORT TO BE EFFECTIVE.

MOST WELL-BABY NURSERIES \u2013 PARTICULARLY THOSE IN RURAL OR MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS \u2013 DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ASP SUPPORT, WHICH IS A MAJOR HEALTH DISPARITY. SCALABLE APPROACHES TO INCREASE IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES, SUCH AS ASPS, ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS SUCH DISPARITIES. TELEHEALTH HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY TO DELIVER OTHER ASPECTS OF NEWBORN CARE, SUCH AS COMPLEX CARE COORDINATION AND HEALTH SCREENING. TELEHEALTH STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN USED IN ADULT AND PEDIATRIC ASP EFFORTS, AND TELEHEALTH FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES SUPPORT HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDY, ASSIST-1, WAS THE FIRST TO UTILIZE TELEHEALTH TO DELIVER ASP SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY FOR NEWBORN NURSERIES. THE ASSIST-1 STUDY OF 8 RURAL NURSERIES SHOWED THAT TELEHEALTH ASP WAS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE, REDUCING UNNECESSARY ANTIBIOTIC USE BY 32%.

DESPITE THEIR PREVALENCE, THESE DISORDERS ARE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL SYMPTOMS REACH A SEVERITY LEVEL REQUIRING INTENSIVE, INVASIVE, AND COSTLY TREATMENT. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS (PCPS) ARE TYPICALLY THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT FOR FAMILIES WITH AN ADOLESCENT SUFFERING FROM AN ED, YET THEY ARE FREQUENTLY UNDER-TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE EARLY SIGNS/SYMPTOMS OR DEVELOP AN APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT PLAN. INDEED, THERE CURRENTLY ARE NO VALIDATED SCREENING TOOLS FOR ADOLESCENT EDS IN PRIMARY CARE, MOST PCPS LACK CONFIDENCE AND COMPETENCE TO ADEQUATELY ASSESS AND DIAGNOSE THESE CONDITIONS, AND ACCESS TO TRAINED SPECIALTY PROVIDERS WITH WHOM TO CONSULT AND/OR REFER IS LIMITED BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, COST, AND LACK OF FAMILIARITY.

THIS APPROACH BUILDS UPON THE FOUNDATION OF PRECISION MEDICINE, IN WHICH CLINICAL DECISIONS ARE TAILORED TO INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF GENOMIC, BIOLOGICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND PUBLIC HEALTH DATA. IN THIS MODEL, EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS CAN LEVERAGE MANY EMERGING SOURCES OF PATIENT DATA DERIVED FROM TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS WEARABLE AND IMPLANTABLE DEVICES, -OMICS, RAPID POINT-OF-CARE TESTING, AND COMMUNITY-BASED AND PUBLIC HEALTH DATABASES. MACHINE LEARNING AND OTHER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN STRENGTHEN ANALYSES OF THESE DATA AND IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING. THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY, MULTI-SOURCE DATA, AND ANALYSES CONTEXTUALIZED TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN PAINT A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE WHOLE PERSON AND INDIVIDUALLY TAILOR EMERGENCY CARE TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE ADOPTION OF PRECISION MEDICINE PRINCIPLES WOULD REPRESENT A PARADIGM SHIFT IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE TOWARDS TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED, DATA-DRIVEN, HIGHER QUALITY, INDIVIDUALIZED CARE. HOWEVER, MOST EMERGENCY PROVIDERS ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THESE NEW DATA SOURCES, HOW TO INTERPRET THEM, AND HOW TO MODIFY THEIR CLINICAL PRACTICES ACCORDINGLY. RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST IMPLEMENT PRECISION EMERGENCY MEDICINE IN AN EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE MANNER. IN THE 2023 SOCIETY FOR ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE (SAEM) CONSENSUS CONFERENCE, PRECISION EMERGENCY MEDICINE: SETTING A RESEARCH AGENDA, WE WILL CONVENE EXPERTS AND THOUGHT LEADERS FROM ACADEMIA AND THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR TO EXAMINE THE KEY CATALYSTS OF PRECISION EMERGENCY MEDICINE, IDENTIFY IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES, AND DEVELOP AN ACTIONABLE 10-YEAR RESEARCH AGENDA WITH RELEVANT PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES.

THE HIGH YIELD MEETING CONTRIBUTED TO NEW RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS AND PROJECTS THAT CONTINUE TO ADVANCE WORK IN THIS AREA. INTEREST IN EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL INTERVENTIONS RESEARCH HAS ONLY GROWN SINCE FEBRUARY 2019, AS FEDERAL AND STATE INCENTIVES ARE ENCOURAGING PROVIDERS AND PAYERS TO INVEST IN SOCIAL CARE INTERVENTIONS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ALSO HAS BROUGHT A UNIQUE URGENCY TO ARTICULATING AND BOLSTERING THE HEALTH SECTOR'S ROLE IN ADDRESSING SOCIAL RISKS. MORE THAN EVER, STAKEHOLDERS INVESTING IN THIS AREA CAN BENEFIT FROM REVIEWING THE STATE OF THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING SCIENCE AND TOGETHER DEFINING A COMMON AGENDA TO ADVANCE THIS NEW FIELD OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH AND PRACTICE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT TO BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION CREATED BY THE 2019 MEETING TO CONVENE A SECOND NATIONAL RESEARCH MEETING (250-300 ATTENDEES) OVER TWO FULL DAYS TO SHOWCASE THE LATEST RESEARCH AND STIMULATE DISCUSSION AND INCREASED COLLABORATION ACROSS DISCIPLINES AND SECTORS. WE INTEND TO INCLUDE DIVERSE VOICES AND PERSPECTIVES IN MEETING ACTIVITIES. AS WE DID IN 2019, WE WILL PROVIDE TRAVEL GRANTS TO SUPPORT PARTICIPATION FROM BOTH PATIENT EXPERTS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH SOCIAL ADVERSITY AND EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS FROM DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS THAT ARE UNDER-REPRESENTED IN HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH. WE ALSO WILL ENGAGE IN MULTIPLE DISSEMINATION ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE MEETING CONTENT IS WIDELY DISSEMINATED BEYOND THE CONFERENCE ATTENDEES. IF THE GLOBAL CONTEXT PROHIBITS IN-PERSON CONVENING, WE WILL HOLD A HYBRID IN-PERSON/VIRTUAL OR FULLY VIRTUAL MEETING.

THE APPALACHIAN REGION, A MOUNTAINOUS REGION INCLUDING ALL OF WEST VIRGINIA (WV), IS DISPROPORTIONATELY RURAL AND MEDICALLY-UNDERSERVED, RESULTING IN DELAYED STAGE OF DIAGNOSIS AND GREATER POTENTIAL FOR PROLONGED MORBIDITY AND EARLIER MORTALITY. ADDITIONALLY, GENETIC SERVICES HAVE BEEN LIMITED IN RURAL, APPALACHIA, AND PARTICULARLY IN WEST VIRGINIA. INNOVATIVE MODELS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE ACCESSIBLE GENETIC SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS IN RURAL, APPALACHIA. TELEGENETICS (TELEMEDICINE GENETIC COUNSELING) HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN INNOVATIVE WAY TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE ACCESSIBILITY, WITH VIDEO TELEGENETICS BEING THE PREFERRED METHOD. YET, LACK OF BROADBAND ACCESS AND CHALLENGES WITH PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT HAS POSED SOME LIMITATIONS TO WIDE- SCALE ADOPTION OF TELEGENETICS IN RURAL, APPALACHIA. FURTHER, NON-TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN EXPLORED AS A MEANS OF MEETING THE NEED FOR GENETIC SERVICES. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS CONFERENCE SERIES ARE (1) TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF CURRENT MODELS OF GENETICS SERVICES IN THE RURAL, APPALACHIAN REGION; (2) TO PROVIDE POTENTIAL RESOURCES FOR GENETICS SERVICE DELIVERY IN THE RURAL, APPALACHIAN REGION; AND (3) TO ESTABLISH A LIST OF PRIORITIES FOR FUTURE GENETICS RESEARCH. OUR TEAM HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN CLINICAL GENETIC SERVICES BOTH IN TERMS OF CARE PROVISION AND OF RESEARCH, AND OUR APPLICATION IS UNIQUELY POISED TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL OF GENETICS IN A RURAL, APPALACHIAN POPULATION.

MACHINE LEARNING AND SYSTEMS SCIENCE METHODS. CONCUSSION, ONE OF THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, AFFLICTS UPWARDS OF 3.6 MILLION PEOPLE ANNUALLY AND IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE CONCUSSION MANAGEMENT IS CONSIDERED A MAJOR FACTOR IN MITIGATING BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THE INJURY.

THERE IS A VITAL ELEMENT OF HEALTHCARE QUALITY WITH A PAUCITY OF DATA ON DISPARITIES: COMPASSION FROM TREATING CLINICIANS. COMPASSION IS HIGHLY VALUED BY PATIENTS AND ESSENTIAL FOR HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE. FOR EXAMPLE, A LACK OF CLINICIAN COMPASSION COULD CONTRIBUTE TO PATIENT DISTRUST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH PATIENT NON-ADHERENCE TO HEALTH MAINTENANCE AND TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS. UNDERSTANDING COMPASSION DISPARITIES IS VITAL FOR IMPROVING HEALTHCARE EQUITY. HEALTH DISPARITY POPULATIONS MAY RECEIVE LESS COMPASSION FROM CLINICIANS DUE TO IMPLICIT BIAS AND/OR RACISM. HOWEVER, OUR PRIOR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CONVENTIONAL AFTER-CARE PATIENT EXPERIENCE (SATISFACTION) SURVEYS ARE PRONE TO NONRESPONSE BIAS AND THUS ARE INADEQUATE TO TEST FOR COMPASSION DISPARITIES. ANONYMOUS, REAL- TIME, POINT-OF-CARE ASSESSMENTS ARE NEEDED. THIS IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE GAP FOR HEALTHCARE EQUITY. COMPARED TO NONDISPARITY POPULATIONS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT (1) PATIENTS IN HEALTH DISPARITY POPULATIONS EXPERIENCE LESS COMPASSION FROM CLINICIANS, (2) LESS COMPASSION FOR HEALTH DISPARITY POPULATIONS MEDIATES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM DISTRUST, AND (3) SALIENT CLINICIAN BEHAVIORS THAT COMMUNICATE COMPASSION (OR LACK OF) FROM THE PATIENT PERSPECTIVE DIFFER FOR HEALTH DISPARITY POPULATIONS. OBJECTIVES: IN A DIVERSE POPULATION OF PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS, (1) WE WILL TEST FOR DIFFERENCES IN PATIENT EXPERIENCE OF CLINICIAN COMPASSION BETWEEN WHITE PATIENTS WITHOUT LOW SES AND (A) BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN, (B) HISPANIC OR LATINX, OR (C) LOW SES PATIENTS.

THESE CLINICAL CHALLENGES ARE MIRRORED IN THE COST OF TREATING SEPSIS, WHICH RANKS HIGHEST AMONG ALL CONDITIONS IN U.S. HOSPITALS AND REPRESENTS 13% OF ALL HOSPITAL COSTS WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR ONLY 3.6% OF ALL HOSPITAL STAYS. A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE TO DIAGNOSING AND TREATING SEPSIS, AND THUS REDUCING ITS COST AND QUALITY BURDEN, IS THAT THERE IS NO CONFIRMATORY DIAGNOSTIC TEST.

THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE QUANTIFYING CHANGES IN ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE \u2013 PARTICULARLY FOR PATIENT POPULATIONS HISTORICALLY FACING ACCESS CHALLENGES \u2013 AFTER GROUP PRACTICES EMPLOY AN NP. TO DO SO, WE PROPOSE USING A DATABASE OF ALL-PAYER CLAIMS AND ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD DATA WITH A NATIONWIDE SAMPLE OF PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS. THIS DATASET ALLOWS US TO OVERCOME THREE DATA CHALLENGES THAT HAVE HINDERED RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC. FIRST, WE ACCURATELY OBSERVE WHO PROVIDED HEALTH CARE SERVICES \u2013 WHICH IS FREQUENTLY DISTINCT FROM WHO BILLED FOR THE CARE. SECOND, WE OBSERVE SCHEDULING DATA, ALLOWING US TO CONSTRUCT OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF ACCESS SUCH AS VISIT WAIT TIME AND SHARE OF VISITS PROVIDED TO NEW PATIENTS. THIRD AND FINALLY, WE OBSERVE ALL CARE PROVIDED BY CLINICIANS WITHIN OUR SAMPLE, REGARDLESS OF PAYER STATUS \u2013 ALLOWING US TO COMPARE MEASURES OF ACCESS ACROSS PATIENT POPULATIONS (I.E., ACCESS FOR MEDICAID PATIENTS COMPARED TO COMMERCIALLY-INSURED PATIENTS). DR. NEPRASH (PI) HAS ACCESS TO AND HAS PUBLISHED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE PROPOSED DATA SOURCE, INCLUDING WORK FOCUSED ON PRIMARY CARE NPS.  IN AIM 1, WE WILL QUANTIFY CHANGES IN ACCESS TO CARE FOR NEW PATIENTS, AFTER AN NP JOINS A PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE. OUTCOMES INCLUDE THE SHARE OF VISITS PROVIDED TO NEW PATIENTS (I.E., THOSE NOT PREVIOUSLY TREATED AT THE PRACTICE), WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON NEW MEDICAID OR UNINSURED PATIENTS AND NEW PATIENTS SELF-IDENTIFYING AS BLACK, INDIGENOUS, AND PEOPLE OF COLOR.  IN AIM 2, WE WILL QUANTIFY OVERALL CHANGES IN ACCESS TO AND CONVENIENCE OF CARE, AFTER AN NP JOINS A PRACTICE. OUTCOMES INCLUDE VISIT WAIT TIME (I.E., DAYS ELAPSED BETWEEN VISIT SCHEDULING AND VISIT OCCURRENCE), THE SHARE OF VISITS PROVIDED ON A WALK-IN BASIS, AND THE SHARE OF VISITS PROVIDED ON EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS.  THIS PILOT STUDY WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST EVIDENCE ON HOW ACCESS TO CARE \u2013 PARTICULARLY FOR AHRQ PRIORITY POPULATIONS \u2013 CHANGES WHEN PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES EMPLOY A NURSE PRACTITIONER. AS NPS BECOME INCREASINGLY PREVALENT WITHIN PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES, IT IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THEY PLAY IN POTENTIALLY EXPANDING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES AND PROVIDING HIGH-QUALITY, EFFICIENT CARE.

IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LIMB SALVAGE CENTERS REDUCES AMPUTATION RATES, IMPROVES PROVIDER TO PROVIDER EDUCATION RESULTING IN EARLIER REFERRAL, IMPROVES PREVENTION MEASURES AND INCREASES GLOBAL FUNCTIONING OF PATIENTS.  CURRENTLY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE STATE OF LIMB SALVAGE ADOPTION BY HOSPITALS IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING WHICH SURGICAL MODALITIES ARE MOST COMMONLY USED, THEIR SPREAD ACROSS REGIONS AND OVER TIME, AND THE SCALE OF OPERATIONS RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY-BASED NEED. EVEN LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THIS CARE IS ORGANIZED WITHIN LOCAL HOSPITAL MARKETS AND HOW THE STRUCTURE OF THESE MARKETS AFFECTS WHICH PATIENTS RECEIVE LIMB SALVAGE VERSUS AMPUTATIONS.

STRUCTURED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ASSESSMENTS, KNOWN AS REPRODUCTIVE LIFE PLANS (RLP), HAVE BEEN PROMOTED AS A STRATEGY TO ROUTINELY INTEGRATE PRECONCEPTION CARE INTO CLINICAL CARE, AND ONE SUCH TOOL, ONE KEY QUESTION\u00ae (OKQ), HOLDS PARTICULAR PROMISE FOR PCPS, AS IT ALLOWS FOR A MEANINGFUL, BRIEF, ASSESSMENT WITHOUT THE NEED TO BE A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EXPERT. OBJECTIVES: THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER-REPRODUCTIVE LIFE PLAN (CHC-RLP) PROJECT, LED BY ALLIANCECHICAGO, A HRSA FUNDED HEALTH CENTER-CONTROLLED NETWORK WITH A SHARED DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING OKQ\u00ae AS A STRUCTURED FIELD, WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF OKQ\u00ae IMPLEMENTATION ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH METRICS IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH, PRIMARY CARE, SETTING. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FRIEND HEALTH, A CHC IN THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO, AND A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS, THE CHC-RLP PROJECT WILL ACHIEVE TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) CONDUCT A STRUCTURED TRAINING FOR OKQ\u00ae IMPLEMENTATION, HARNESSING THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) AS A TOOL; AND 2) LEVERAGE EHR DATA AND UTILIZE AN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE WHETHER OKQ\u00ae IMPLEMENTATION INFLUENCES REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (PRECONCEPTION AND CONTRACEPTIVE CARE) METRICS. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WILL BE GUIDED BY THE REACH, EFFECTIVENESS, ADOPTION, IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE, (RE-AIM) FRAMEWORK. RANDOMIZATION WILL OCCUR AT THE LEVEL OF THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER, AND RANDOMIZED PROVIDERS WILL RECEIVE STRUCTURED OKQ\u00ae TRAINING, INCLUDING BOTH CLINICAL GUIDANCE AS WELL AS SUPPORT FOR INCORPORATING OKQ\u00ae INTO CLINIC WORKFLOW AND DOCUMENTATION IN THE EHR. AFTER 12 MONTHS OF IMPLEMENTATION, EHR DATA ON SERVICE PROVISION AND OUTCOMES WILL BE EXPLORED TO DETERMINE SUCCESS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AND DIFFERENCES IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES (CONTRACEPTIVE PROVISION AND FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTATION) BETWEEN THE PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED CARE FROM THE PROVIDERS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP AS COMPARED TO PATIENTS FROM THE PROVIDERS IN THE CONTROL, USUAL-CARE, GROUP. IMPLICATIONS OF EXPECTED FINDINGS: THE RESULTS WILL INFORM A FUTURE LARGE-SCALE EFFICACY TRIAL, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES TO ENDORSE RLP AS A QUALITY METRIC, AND FURTHER VALIDATE THE NOTION OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A TOOL TO MITIGATE HEALTH DISPARITIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b02bffe7-5ec1-e1cd-9971-93540f059c3d-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R03HS027686_7528"}, {"internal_id": 140057744, "Award ID": "R03HS027680", "Award Amount": 52191.55, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-14", "CFDA Number": "93.226", "Description": "A SYSTEMS INVESTIGATION OF MATERNAL CARE - PROJECT SUMMARY DESPITE HAVING THE MOST EXPENSIVE MATERNITY CARE IN THE WORLD, THE MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE (MMR) IN THE US INCREASED TO 16.9 DEATHS PER 100,000 LIVE BIRTHS IN 2017, WITH ESTIMATES AS HIGH AS 26.4 IN 2015. FOR EVERY MATERNAL DEATH THERE ARE 50 - 100 CASES OF SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY (SMM) AND THIS RATE HAS ALSO INCREASED SHARPLY \u2013 RISING 45% BETWEEN 2006 AND 2015. WOMEN OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER MORTALITY AND SMM; BLACK WOMEN ARE 3 TO 4 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM PREGNANCY-RELATED CAUSES THAN WHITE WOMEN. MATERNAL MORTALITY AND SMM COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR. HOWEVER, 45 \u2013 60% OF ALL MATERNAL DEATHS AND SMM ARE PREVENTABLE WITH TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE CARE. THUS, DISPARITIES IN MORTALITY AND SMM ARE NOT ONLY RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL VARIABLES BUT ALSO TO MULTILEVEL CONTRIBUTORS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH SERVICE QUALITY. EXAMINATION OF THE STRUCTURES AND PROCESSES OF CARE WOULD HELP UNCOVER CHALLENGES IN THE CLINICAL SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO POOR MATERNAL CARE AND DISPARITIES AND IDENTIFY ALSO FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM OF CARE THAT ARE AMENABLE TO INTERVENTIONS. DESPITE 20 YEARS OF SYSTEMS RESEARCH IN HEALTHCARE, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE CONTRIBUTION OF CLINICAL SYSTEMS TO ADVERSE OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL CARE. INITIAL OBSERVATIONS IN THE MATERNAL CARE UNITS - ANTEPARTUM, LABOR AND DELIVERY (L&D), AND POSTPARTUM - AND REVIEW OF PATIENT SAFETY INCIDENCES IDENTIFIED A RANGE OF SYSTEMS ISSUES SUCH AS UNDERSTAFFING, EXTENSIVE USE OF INEXPERIENCED CONTRACT NURSES, MISSING EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES, AND MALFUNCTIONING EQUIPMENT, THAT IMPACTED PATIENT CARE. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF 19 MONTHS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DATA FOUND THAT THE HOSPITAL\u2019S L&D UNIT DELIVERED 4,057 PATIENTS, AN AVERAGE OF 225.39 PATIENTS EACH MONTH, AND THE CESAREAN DELIVERY RATE WAS 38%. THERE WERE 45 READMISSIONS DURING THIS PERIOD, 15 RECORDED CASES OF SMM (HEMORRHAGE, HYSTERECTOMY, AND ABSCESS) AND ONE MATERNAL DEATH. THIS DATA WAS NOT DISAGGREGATED BY RACE. THIS RESEARCH PROPOSES A MIXED METHODS APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE SYSTEMS SAFETY AND EQUITY BY CONDUCTING A PROGNOSTIC RISK ASSESSMENT AND EXAMINING DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCIDENTS AS A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF DISPARATE CARE. THIS RESEARCH WILL DESCRIBE, IN MORE DETAIL THAN HAS EVER BEEN AVAILABLE BEFORE, HOW THE CLINICIANS DELIVERING MATERNAL CARE ARE PREDISPOSED TO SUCCESS OR FAILURE BY THE DESIGN OF THE WORK SYSTEM AND OFFER A REASONABLE APPROXIMATIONS OF DISPARATE QUALITY OF CARE IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY, THE FOLLOWING THREE AIMS WILL BE CONDUCTED: AIM 1: DEVELOP A SOCIOTECHNICAL SYSTEMS MODEL OF MATERNAL CARE USING A WORK SYSTEMS ANALYSIS; AIM 2: EXAMINE RISKS IN MATERNAL CARE UNITS USING PATIENT SAFETY INCIDENT REPORTS; AND AIM 3: IDENTIFY SOCIOTECHNICAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO DISPARITIES IN ADVERSE EVENTS IN MATERNAL CARE.

THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EVALUATE THE BENEFITS AND SAFETY OF DMA DISCONTINUATION IN OLDER ADULTS. ALTHOUGH SOME STUDIES WITH LIMITED SAMPLES FOUND PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR DMA DISCONTINUATION, NO LARGE-SCALE PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY EVALUATED BOTH THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DMA DEPRESCRIBING IN OLDER ADULTS.

UNNECESSARY ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT INCREASES THE RISK OF DEVELOPING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE, ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO PATIENTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH. WE PREVIOUSLY FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF 1,265 URINE CULTURES COLLECTED FROM WOMEN AND MEN IN TWO PRIMARY CARE CLINICS WERE CONTAMINATED. PRIOR TRIALS THAT ATTEMPTED TO REDUCE URINE CONTAMINATION USING PATIENT EDUCATION HAD MIXED RESULTS. HOWEVER, THESE PRIOR STUDIES DID NOT INCLUDE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND WERE NOT PRECEDED BY PILOT STUDIES, A CRITICAL STEP IN THE PROCESS OF INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT. UNTIL WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION, CONTAMINATED SAMPLES WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE MEANINGLESS RESULTS, TRIGGER UNDUE ANTIBIOTIC USE, AND INFLATE COSTS.

ANTIBIOTIC OVERUSE AT HOSPITAL DISCHARGE IS COMMON, COSTLY, AND HARMFUL. WHILE EVIDENCE-BASED ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP STRATEGIES EXIST TO IMPROVE PRESCRIBING, THEY ARE NOT REACHING PATIENTS AS THEY TRANSITION ACROSS CARE SETTINGS.

UNFORTUNATELY, THE BENEFITS OF ASPS HAVE LARGELY FAILED TO TRANSLATE TO THE UNIQUE AND FAST-PACED ED ENVIRONMENT. THIS REPRESENTS A KEY MISSED OPPORTUNITY SINCE MANY MORE CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR IN THE ED AS COMPARED TO INPATIENT SETTINGS, AND BECAUSE ED CARE OFTEN CRITICALLY INFLUENCES SUBSEQUENT HOSPITAL CARE. OUR PRIOR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT HIGH QUALITY ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD-BASED CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS) IS A STRATEGY THAT COULD BRIDGE THE ED ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP GAP AND REDUCE INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING IN THE ED AND HOSPITAL. OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH BUILDS UPON THIS FOUNDATIONAL WORK AND LEVERAGES AN ACCOMPLISHED AND DIVERSE STUDY TEAM WITH EXPERTISE ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CLINICAL CARE AND IN BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS, CLINICAL AND HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH, IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, AND BIOSTATISTICS, ALL HOUSED WITHIN SUPPORTIVE AND WELL- RESOURCED RESEARCH ENVIRONMENTS.

DECREASING THE UTILIZATION IS CHALLENGING, YET SIGNIFICANT, AS MANY GUIDELINES SUPPORT THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS AS FIRST-LINE DESPITE A LACK OF RESEARCH SHOWING BENEFIT. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS SUCH VARIATION IN TREATMENT NOT ONLY REGARDING ANTIBIOTIC USE BUT ALSO AROUND USE OF OTHER MEDICATIONS, INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS DRAINAGE, AND TIMING OF EACH OF THESE.

CHEST PAIN IS THE SECOND MOST COMMON CAUSE OF ED VISITS AND MOST COMMON REASON FOR SHORT-STAY HOSPITALIZATIONS. DURING THESE HOSPITALIZATIONS PATIENTS UNDERGO IN-DEPTH EVALUATIONS (STRESS TESTING, COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY, OR INVASIVE ANGIOGRAPHY), BUT ULTIMATELY <10% ARE DIAGNOSED WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS). THESE EVALUATIONS COST $3 BILLION ANNUALLY AND STRAIN HEALTH SYSTEM RESOURCES WITHOUT CLEAR EVIDENCE OF IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES OR PATIENT EXPERIENCE. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT MODERATE RISK PATIENTS (35% OF PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN) CAN BE SAFELY MANAGED AS OUTPATIENTS USING A CARDIOVASCULAR AMBULATORY RAPID EVALUATION (CARE) STRATEGY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO HOSPITALIZATION. IN THE CARE STRATEGY, PATIENTS ARE DISCHARGED FROM THE ED AND RECEIVE OUTPATIENT CLINIC FOLLOW-UP WITHIN 72 HOURS FOCUSED ON MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOR CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS (E.G., HYPERTENSION, DIABETES) AND DETERMINING WHETHER FURTHER CARDIAC TESTING IS NEEDED. THIS STRATEGY AIMS TO ENHANCE PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES WHILE SAFELY AND EQUITABLY DECREASING HOSPITAL RESOURCE UTILIZATION. HOWEVER, EQUIPOISE EXISTS BETWEEN OUTPATIENT AND HOSPITALIZATION STRATEGIES FOR MODERATE RISK PATIENTS.

ONE POPULAR SUCH METHOD IS DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES (DIFF-IN-DIFF), WHICH COMPARES CHANGES IN OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE EXPOSED TO A NEW MODEL VERSUS CHANGES OVER THE SAME TIME IN A COMPARISON GROUP OF PEOPLE NOT EXPOSED TO THE MODEL. WHILE USEFUL FOR OVERALL PROGRAM IMPACTS, STANDARD DIFF-IN-DIFF METHODS ARE NOT SUITED TO EQUITY EVALUATIONS. THE TARGET ESTIMANDS ARE NOT FORMULATED FOR EQUITY QUESTIONS, THEY DO NOT ACCOMMODATE VARYING RESPONSES ACROSS SUBGROUPS, AND THEY DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR VARIATION IN TREATMENT EFFECTS. IN ADDITION, THE METHODS ARE NOT GROUNDED IN FRAMEWORKS FOR HEALTH EQUITY AND THUS FAIL TO USE CAUSAL ASSUMPTIONS TAILORED FOR GROUPS WHO EXPERIENCE DISPROPORTIONATE DISADVANTAGE. PARTLY BECAUSE OF THESE METHODOLOGICAL SHORTCOMINGS, EXISTING EVIDENCE ON EQUITY IMPACTS OF MEDICARE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS IS SPARSE AND MIXED. PRIMARY CARE TRANSFORMATION MODELS HAVE RECEIVED EVEN LESS ATTENTION.

TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE PANDEMIC IS OCCURRING IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OF OPIOID USE DISORDER AND OVERDOSE DURING PREGNANCY. BETWEEN 2010 AND 2017, THE INCIDENCE OF MATERNAL OPIOID-RELATED DIAGNOSES INCREASED FROM 3.5 TO 8.2 PER 1000 HOSPITAL LIVE BIRTHS PER YEAR. MATERNAL OPIOID USE DURING PREGNANCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISKS OF PROLONGED HOSPITAL STAY, PLACENTAL ABRUPTION, POOR FETAL GROWTH, PRETERM LABOR, PREMATURE DELIVERY, STILLBIRTH, NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME, AND MATERNAL DEATH. STATE RESPONSES REGARDING MATERNAL OPIOID USE DURING PREGNANCY PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAVE VARIED WIDELY AND INCLUDED: 1) CREATION OF FUNDED DRUG-TREATMENT PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN, 2) PRIORITY ACCESS TO STATE-FUNDED TREATMENT PROGRAMS, 3) MANDATED REPORTING AND DRUG SCREENING BY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, AND 4) CRIMINALIZATION OF OPIOID USE DURING PREGNANCY OR GROUNDS FOR COMMITMENT. HOWEVER, THESE POLICIES ARE UNLIKELY TO REMAIN STATIC, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE NEED FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING HAS LED TO POLICY CHANGES RELATED TO TREATMENT OF OPIOID USE DISORDER MORE GENERALLY, SUCH AS EASING METHADONE DISPENSING RULES AND MAKING IT EASIER FOR PATIENTS TO INITIATE BUPRENORPHINE TREATMENT FROM AN OPIOID TREATMENT CENTER. THESE CHANGES ARE NOT MANDATORY, HOWEVER, AND SYSTEM-LEVEL GAINS IN ACCESS TO MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT (MAT) MAY BE ELIMINATED AS THE PANDEMIC SUBSIDES. IN ADDITION, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH POLICIES RELATED TO MATERNAL OPIOID USE DURING PREGNANCY ARE CHANGING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH CHANGES AFFECT MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTHCARE TREATMENT, OUTCOMES AND COSTS.

THE PRACTICE OF SDM IS WIDELY PROMOTED THROUGH CLINICAL GUIDELINES, ORGANIZATIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES AND INITIATIVES, AND IS A FEATURE OF PATIENT-CENTERED CARE. A GOAL OF SDM IS TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES THROUGH ENHANCING PATIENTS\u2019 PARTICIPATION IN DECISION MAKING, HOWEVER IT HAS PROVEN HARD TO ESTABLISH THIS IMPACT, IN PART DUE TO LIMITATIONS IN MEASURING SDM. RESEARCHERS CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE THE MEASURES THEY NEED TO DETERMINE IF, IN ANY PATIENT-CLINICIAN ENCOUNTER, A SDM PROCESS WAS USED TO COLLABORATIVELY DELIBERATE AND FORM A PLAN OF CARE. THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE THE OCCURRENCE OF SDM IS HIGHLY LIMITED BY A LACK OF CONCEPTUAL AND OPERATIONAL CLARITY AROUND SDM, NARROW MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORKS, AND LIMITATIONS TO EXISTING OBSERVER AND SELF-REPORTED MEASURES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF CHRONIC MULTIMORBIDITY.

THE PROLONGATION OF EMPIRIC TREATMENT HAMPERS ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP EFFORTS AND ENCOURAGES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE. OUR OVERALL GOAL IS TO IMPROVE ANTIMICROBIAL PRESCRIBING FOR PATIENTS WITH CAP BY EMPHASIZING PATHOGEN-DIRECTED THERAPY. AN ACCURATE PATHOGENIC DIAGNOSIS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP IN 2 WAYS: 1) BY ALLOWING FOR INITIAL NARROW-SPECTRUM THERAPY AND 2) BY PROVIDING CONFIDENCE WHEN DE-ESCALATING THERAPY FOLLOWING NEGATIVE CULTURES. RAPID DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE ACCURATE RESULTS WITHIN HOURS AND THEREBY REDUCE THE DURATION OF EXPOSURE TO EXTENDED SPECTRUM EMPIRIC THERAPY. MULTIPLE OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT USE OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FAVORABLE OUTCOMES INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN THE TOTAL DURATION OF ANTIMICROBIAL USE AND LENGTH OF STAY IN THE HOSPITAL. THE MOST RECENT ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES RECOMMEND THE USE OF RAPID VIRAL TESTING FOR RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS AS A MEANS TO REDUCE THE USE OF INAPPROPRIATE ANTIBIOTICS. HOWEVER, THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED ON LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE AND IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER MORE WIDESPREAD EARLY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING COULD REDUCE THE USE OF BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS AND/OR PROMPT INITIATION OF ANTIVIRAL THERAPY. DE-ESCALATION FOLLOWING NEGATIVE BACTERIAL CULTURES IS ANOTHER ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP TARGET. WHILE MOST DE-ESCALATION FOLLOWS IDENTIFICATION OF A SUSCEPTIBLE PATHOGEN, THE ATS/IDSA GUIDELINES ALSO RECOMMEND DE-ESCALATION AT 48 HOURS IF CULTURES ARE NEGATIVE. HOWEVER, THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALSO BASED ON OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES. WE PROPOSE A LARGE, MULTICENTER 2 X 2 FACTORIAL CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO TEST BOTH APPROACHES TO REDUCING THE USE OF BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS IN PATIENTS WITH CAP: A) ROUTINE USE OF RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION AND B) PHARMACIST-LED DE-ESCALATION AFTER 48 HOURS FOR CLINICALLY STABLE PATIENTS WITH NEGATIVE CULTURES. OUR STUDY WILL BE THE LARGEST RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTING ON ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP AND PATIENT OUTCOMES. OUR RANDOMIZED TRIAL DESIGN WILL ALLOW US TO ESTABLISH CAUSALITY AND DETERMINE WHETHER BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS CAN BE SAFELY DE-ESCALATED IN STABLE PATIENTS. FINDINGS FROM OUR PROPOSED TRIALS WILL GENERATE IMPORTANT NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PATHOGEN TARGETED THERAPY AND ANTIMICROBIAL DE-ESCALATION IN PATIENTS WITH CAP.

THIS MAY REFLECT A DUAL SHORTCOMING IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL PREPARATION. FIRST THE AVERAGE MEDICAL SCHOOL SPENDS 0 TO 6 HOURS ON CHRONIC PAIN, WHEN PAIN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF PAIN (IASP) SUGGEST 74 HOURS. SECOND, MEDICAL TRAINING IS PRIMARILY ORIENTED TOWARDS A BIOPHARMACOLOGIC FRAMEWORK. WHILE DRUGS MAY HELP THE NOCICEPTIVE COMPONENT OF PAIN, AND ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION, THEY OFFER LITTLE TO ADDRESS THE CORE EMOTIONAL, COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL ROOTS OF CHRONIC PAIN. THIS BIOPHARMACOLOGIC MINDSET, THAT A DRUG MIGHT \u201cDO IT ALL\u201d, MAY HAVE SET A STAGE FOR TODAY'S OPIOID CRISIS.  MANAGING THESE DEEPER CHRONIC PAIN ISSUES REQUIRES A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FRAMEWORK, THAT VIEWS A CHRONIC PAIN SYNDROME AS A BRAIN DISORDER, REINFORCED BY YEARS OF NEGATIVE COGNITIVE, EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL HABITS, REQUIRING RETRAINING THROUGH PHYSICAL & BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION, AND COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS FRAMEWORK AND SKILLSET ARE FOREIGN TO MOST PCPS, THEY REMAIN ILL-PREPARED TO MANAGE THE TOTALITY OF A CHRONIC PAIN SYNDROME. IN THE 4PCP (PRIMARY PRACTICE PHYSICIAN PROGRAM FOR CHRONIC PAIN) PILOT, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT PCPS EAGERLY LEARNED AND IMPLEMENTED THIS NEW FRAMEWORK INTO THEIR PRACTICE, INCREASING CONFIDENCE WITH CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT, REDUCING VISIT TIMES, AND IMPROVING PATIENT PAIN.

IN PRIMARY CARE, GREATER CONTINUITY OF PATIENT CARE IS ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS, LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS, AND HIGHER PATIENT SATISFACTION. CONTINUITY-BASED ACUTE CARE STAFFING MODELS ALSO EXIST, BUT ARE RARELY ADOPTED AND SUSTAINED IN PRACTICE, PARTICULARLY IN ICUS WHERE CONTINUITY-BASED ASSIGNMENTS CAN BE CHALLENGING TO OPERATIONALIZE. IMPORTANTLY, ALTHOUGH CRITICAL CARE IS DELIVERED BY INTERPROFESSIONAL TEAMS OF PHYSICIANS, NURSES, AND RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS, CONTINUITY OF INTERPROFESSIONAL ICU TEAMS HAS NEVER BEEN CONCEPTUALIZED OR MEASURED BEFORE.

FOR INSTANCE, IT IS CHALLENGING TO ENACT PERMANENT TELEMEDICINE POLICIES THAT FACILITATE THE EQUITABLE USE OF TELEMEDICINE WITHOUT AN UNDERSTANDING OF PATIENT, PROVIDER AND MARKET BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE ITS USE. FURTHERMORE, WHILE WIDESPREAD TELEMEDICINE USE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES SUCH AS PREVENTABLE HOSPITAL ADMISSION RATES, THERE IS A LACK OF EMPIRICAL DATA ON THIS TOPIC. FINALLY, WHILE ESSENTIAL FOR POLICYMAKING, THE BROAD SCALE IMPACT OF TELEMEDICINE USE ON MEDICARE SPENDING AND UTILIZATION HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED. THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN TELEMEDICINE USE AS A RESULT OF HEALTHCARE POLICIES ENACTED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PROVIDES AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE LONG-STANDING KNOWLEDGE GAPS. OVERALL STRATEGY: IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE USING A CONTEMPORARY, NATIONAL COHORT OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES SUPPLEMENTED WITH DETAILED PROVIDER AND MARKET-LEVEL DATA TO INVESTIGATE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH TELEMEDICINE USE, AND THE IMPACT OF TELEMEDICINE ON AMBULATORY CARE OUTCOMES AND HEALTHCARE SPENDING. RESEARCH AIMS: 1) TO IDENTIFY PATIENT, PROVIDER AND MARKET-LEVEL DETERMINANTS OF TELEMEDICINE USE. WE WILL EXPLORE HETEROGENEITY IN TELEMEDICINE USE ACROSS SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING BENEFICIARIES THAT ARE RURALLY LOCATED, ELDERLY, RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES, OR SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. 2) TO EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PRACTICE-LEVEL TELEMEDICINE USE AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR AMBULATORY CARE SENSITIVE CONDITIONS. 3) TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF CLINICIAN-LEVEL TELEMEDICINE USE ON 30-DAY TOTAL PER CAPITA COSTS.

SYSTEM RESPONSIVENESS AND CLINICIAN PREPAREDNESS ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT SAFETY THREATS FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND STAFF. RAPIDLY EVOLVING CARE GUIDELINES FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS RESULT IN CONTINUOUS CHANGES TO IMPLEMENTATION AT THE BEDSIDE, PRESENTING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THE INTRODUCTION OF LATENT SAFETY THREATS. CLINICIAN EXPOSURE TO ACUTE OCCUPATIONAL STRESS EVENTS CAN LEAD TO AN ACTIVATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, RESULTING IN KEY PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES INCLUDING A DECREASE IN HEART RATE VARIABILITY. REPEATED OR CONTINUOUS STRESS EXPOSURE, LEADING TO LOWER HEART RATE VARIABILITY, IS LINKED TO INCREASED MEDICAL ERRORS AND DECREASED PATIENT SATISFACTION.

PACE PARTICIPANTS ARE GENERALLY DEPENDENT IN AT LEAST 2 ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADLS) OR NEED CONSTANT SUPERVISION DUE TO COGNITIVE DISABILITY. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR PACE ENROLLMENT, PARTICIPANTS MUST BE ABLE TO LIVE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY WITH PACE SERVICES. THE HEART OF THE PACE MODEL LIES IN ITS COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE ARRAY, STARTING WITH A PARTICIPANT-CENTERED CARE PLAN CONSTRUCTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM AND ANCHORED IN A PACE DAY CENTER THAT REGULARLY OFFERS MEDICAL CARE, PERSONAL CARE, THERAPIES, MEALS, SOCIALIZATION, TRANSPORTATION, AND ACTIVITIES. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, PACE PROGRAMS HAVE USED THEIR FLEXIBILITY AS A COMMUNITY-BASED PROVIDER OF MEDICAL AND LONG-TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS (LTSS) TO REDESIGN SERVICE DELIVERY AND KEEP FRAIL ELDERS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE IN THE COMMUNITY. PRELIMINARY REPORTS TO THE NATIONAL PACE ASSOCIATION (NPA) INDICATE THAT MOST PROGRAMS QUICKLY EXPANDED TELEHEALTH AND MOVED MANY SERVICES TO THE HOME. ANECDOTAL ACCOUNTS INDICATE THAT SOME PROGRAMS HAVE IMPLEMENTED REMARKABLE ADAPTATIONS: E.G., PROVIDING OVERNIGHT CARE (NOT TYPICALLY ALLOWED IN PACE), RENTING HOTEL ROOMS FOR INFECTED PARTICIPANTS, MAKING PART OF THE PACE CENTER AN ISOLATION AREA, REDEFINING STAFF ROLES AND PROVIDING TRAINING IN THOSE NEW ROLES, AND PROVIDING POST-HOSPITAL THERAPIES IN THE PACE CENTER TO AVOID SENDING FRAIL ELDERS TO POST-ACUTE STAYS IN NURSING HOMES, WHICH HAVE HAD HIGH RATES OF COVID-19 INFECTION.

MOST PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY FAILURE UNDERGO HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENT IN AN OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS FACILITY THREE TIMES A WEEK ALONGSIDE OTHER PATIENTS. THIS CAN RESULT IN UNAVOIDABLE PATIENT CLUSTERING AND AN INCREASED RISK OF VIRAL TRANSMISSION. FURTHER, PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY FAILURE OFTEN HAVE MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES, HIGH BASELINE RATES OF MORTALITY, AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE BLACK OR HISPANIC, RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. HIGH HOSPITALIZATION RATES FOR ESKD PATIENTS ALSO DEMANDS A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS SEAMLESS CARE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS. IN ORDER TO MITIGATE PATIENTS' RISK OF CONTRACTING COVID-19, FACILITIES COULD IMPLEMENT SEVERAL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES, INCLUDING REDUCING THE DURATION OF EACH HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENT SESSION, ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO SEPARATE FACILITIES OR SHIFTS THAT SPECIFICALLY ACCOMMODATE COVID-19 PATIENTS, ESTABLISHING ADDITIONAL \u201cISOLATION\u201d STATIONS WITHIN A FACILITY, OFFERING TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS RECEIVING HOME DIALYSIS, AND PROVIDING CARE TO NURSING HOME RESIDENTS IN THE NURSING HOME AS OPPOSED TO AN OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS FACILITY. SOME DIALYSIS FACILITIES HAVE REPORTED IMPLEMENTING THESE STRATEGIES, BUT SYSTEMATIC NATIONAL DATA ABOUT THEIR ADOPTION AND ASSOCIATION WITH MEANINGFUL PATIENT OUTCOMES ARE NOT KNOWN. USING DATA FROM THE UNIVERSE OF ALL OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS FACILITIES AND A CENSUS OF PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY FAILURE UNDERGOING DIALYSIS FOR THE PERIOD 2018-2022, THIS PROJECT HAS THREE AIMS. FIRST, WE ESTIMATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH COVID-19 SPURRED THE FACILITY-LEVEL ADOPTION OF INFECTION-CONTROL PRACTICES, AND TO EXAMINE THE HETEROGENEITY IN ADOPTION ACROSS FACILITIES.

SECOND, WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FACILITY-LEVEL INFECTION-CONTROL RESPONSES ON COVID-19 RELATED- AND ALL-CAUSE HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY. OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF INFECTION- RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND MORTALITY, BUT NON-COVID-19 AND OVERALL HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY RATES INCREASED. THIRD, WE ESTIMATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH HEMODIALYSIS SESSIONS WERE IMPACTED FOR DIALYSIS PATIENTS ADMITTED TO HOSPITALS IN HIGH-COVID-19 COUNTIES. OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT DIALYSIS PATIENTS ADMITTED TO HOSPITALS IN COUNTIES WITH HIGH COVID-19 INFECTION RATES OR COVID-19 \u201cHOTSPOTS\u201d EXPERIENCE GREATER REDUCTIONS IN DIALYSIS SESSIONS.

THE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA (MUSC) HAD A WELL-DEVELOPED AND TESTED DISASTER PLAN NORMALLY IMPLEMENTED TO RESPOND TO DISRUPTIONS DUE TO HURRICANES. AN IMPORTANT FACET OF THE PLAN IS FREE VIRTUAL URGENT CARE (VUC) VISITS HOSTED BY THE MUSC CENTER FOR TELEHEALTH. THROUGH COLLABORATION ACROSS MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAMS AND STRATEGIC PLANNING, FOUR TELEHEALTH PROGRAMS WITH CORRESPONDING INFORMATICS SYSTEMS WERE DEPLOYED IN THE INITIAL WEEKS OF THE PANDEMIC: VUC SCREENING, REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING FOR COVID-19 POSITIVE PATIENTS, CONTINUOUS VIRTUAL MONITORING TO REDUCE WORKFORCE RISK AND UTILIZATION OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, AND THE TRANSITION OF OUTPATIENT CARE TO TELEHEALTH. HOWEVER, THE SPEED, DIVERSE NEEDS, AND HIGH VOLUME OF SERVICES WERE UNPRECEDENTED AND THUS THESE CHANGES REQUIRE EXTENSIVE EVALUATION TO BETTER PREPARE FOR FUTURE CHALLENGES.

PURPOSE: ON MARCH 13, 2020, AS THE US DECLARED COVID-19 A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, OUR TEAM CREATED A NATIONAL RESEARCH COLLABORATORY AND LAUNCHED THE \u201cQUICK COVID-19 PRIMARY CARE SURVEY\u201d (C19 SURVEY) TO FILL THAT GAP. THE PILOT C19 SURVEY BEGAN AS A CLINICIAN-BASED WEEKLY NATIONAL SURVEY TO MONITOR THE RESPONSE, CHALLENGES, AND CAPACITY OF US PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

THIS EVENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR HOSPITALS TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAMS TO DEAL WITH THE CURRENT CRISIS AND FUTURE DISASTER EVENTS. FEDERAL AGENCIES AND OTHERS HAVE PUBLISHED GUIDELINES ON HOSPITAL EM, BUT THESE GUIDELINES FREQUENTLY CHANGE, ARE SOMETIMES INCONSISTENT, AND DO NOT DESCRIBE THE PROCESS FOR EFFECTIVELY MANAGING EMERGENCIES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES. CONSEQUENTLY, HOSPITALS HAVE INVOKED A VARIETY OF EM PRACTICES IN DEALING WITH COVID-19, WITH VARYING IMPACT. THE VARIATION IN EM IS ESPECIALLY SALIENT WHEN COMPARING RURAL AND URBAN HOSPITALS, WHICH NOT ONLY DIFFER IN TERMS OF RESOURCES AND THE SURGE IN COVID-19 CASES, BUT RURAL HOSPITALS ARE TYPICALLY LOCATED IN AREAS WITH A LARGER HIGH-RISK POPULATION OF PATIENTS WITH UNDERLYING CONDITIONS WHO CAN HAVE GREATER COMPLICATIONS IF COVID- 19 IS CONTRACTED. THEREFORE, IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND HOSPITAL EM IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 ACROSS BOTH URBAN AND RURAL SETTINGS.

MANY PATIENTS ARE RESILIENT AND RECOVER WELL EMOTIONALLY, BUT OVER 20% (~600,000 PEOPLE PER YEAR) DEVELOP MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS SUCH AS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND DEPRESSION, BOTH MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR SOCIAL AND OCCUPATIONAL IMPAIRMENT; POOR PHYSICAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE; AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY, WORK, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. MOST TRAUMA CENTERS DO NOT ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH RECOVERY OF PATIENTS AFTER A TRAUMATIC INJURY. THIS GAP IN THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE, COMBINED WITH UNIQUE BARRIERS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT TRAUMATIC INJURY PATIENTS FACE, NECESSITATES A COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AT EACH STAGE OF THE RECOVERY PROCESS. WE WILL TEST THE TRAUMA RESILIENCE AND RECOVERY PROGRAM (TRRP), A SCALABLE, SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH RECOVERY OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED A TRAUMATIC INJURY.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ON THE FREQUENCY OF DRUG SHORTAGES CAUSING TREATMENT DISRUPTION AND SUBSEQUENT IMPACT ON ADVERSE CLINICAL OUTCOMES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN LONG-TERM CARE AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF DRUG SHORTAGES OCCUR. THE US AND CANADA ARE BOTH AT RISK FOR SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION LEADING TO DRUG SHORTAGES IN A GLOBAL EMERGENCY. DUR- ING THE PANDEMIC, BOTH COUNTRIES IMPLEMENTED POLICIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF DRUG SHORTAGES. HOWEVER, CANADIAN POLICY WAS GENERALLY MORE STRINGENT AND IMPLEMENTED EARLIER. THESE POLICIES MAY IMPACT THE DRUG SUPPLY CHAIN DIFFERENTLY ALLOWING FOR COMPARISON OF POLICY EFFECTIVENESS. ALTHOUGH THE PROBLEM OF DRUG SHORTAGES IS WELL KNOWN, THERE IS A GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPACT OF DRUG SHORTAGES DURING A GLOBAL EMERGENCY. THIS GAP IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE DRUG SHORTAGES ARE OCCURRING WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY AND POP- ULATION-BASED RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO INFORM FUTURE DRUG SHORTAGE STRATEGY (E.G, DOMESTIC DRUG PRODUCTION).

THIS AIM WILL UTILIZE A PRAGMATIC RANDOMIZED CLUSTER MULTIPLE CROSSOVER CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN IN ABOUT 39,000 PATIENTS IN FOUR HOSPITALS. SPECIFIC AIM 2 WILL TEST A PATIENT-FACING HEALTH INFORMATICS APP THAT ENCOURAGES NON- OPIOID PAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THIS AIM EMPLOYS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN IN 600 SURGICAL PATIENTS. TWO SEPARATE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE PROPOSED BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT OUTCOMES (AMOUNT OF OPIOIDS PRESCRIBED VS. OPIOIDS USED) AND SCOPES OF IMPLEMENTATION (MULTISITE VS. SINGLE SITE). THE PROVIDER-FACING TOOL WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE TRIAL OF THE PATIENT-FACING APP USING A 2X2 DESIGN THAT FACILITATES A DETAILED EVALUATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS, AS WELL AS ANY INTERACTIONS WHEN USING THE INTERVENTIONS TOGETHER. FINALLY, SPECIFIC AIM 3 WILL INCLUDE A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS AND COMPARE THE INDIVIDUAL AND COMBINED COST- EFFECTIVENESS OF A PROVIDER-FACING AND A PATIENT-FACING INTERVENTION. COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THE AMOUNTS OF OPIOIDS PRESCRIBED AND OPIOIDS TAKEN AFTER DISCHARGE FOLLOWING SURGERY CAN BE REDUCED WHILE ENSURING EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF PAIN. INCREASING ACCESS TO SAFE, AFFORDABLE, AND HIGH-QUALITY PAIN THERAPY FOR SURGICAL PATIENTS WILL DRIVE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THIS APPLICATION, WHICH DIRECTLY ADDRESSES SPECIAL EMPHASIS NOTICE: AHRQ ANNOUNCES INTEREST IN HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH TO ADDRESS THE OPIOIDS CRISIS (NOT-HS-18-015).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NE", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ce6cc294-968c-0136-a2e3-f34319ce4753-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01HS027795_7528"}, {"internal_id": 110233234, "Award ID": "R01HS027793", "Award Amount": 1573206.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-10", "CFDA Number": "93.226", "Description": "TRANSFORMING KIDNEY CARE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DRIVEN CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01HS027793_7528"}, {"internal_id": 110025122, "Award ID": "R01HS027791", "Award Amount": 1325678.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-31", "CFDA Number": "93.226", "Description": "METHODS FOR PROFILING HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE BASED ON HEALTHCARE-ASSOCIATEDINFECTIONS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c0103b26-3b3f-708e-e041-01c60221a8b9-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01HS027791_7528"}, {"internal_id": 147873824, "Award ID": "R01HS027790", "Award Amount": 799999.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-19", "CFDA Number": "93.226", "Description": "PATIENT PERSPECTIVES ON PRESCRIPTION OPIOID DISCONTINUATION: UNDERSTANDING AND PROMOTING SAFE TRANSITIONS - PROJECT SUMMARY  HIGH RATES OF OPIOID-RELATED MORTALITY HAVE LED TO CLINICAL AND GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, INCLUDING GUIDELINES FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, RECOMMENDING DECREASED USE OF OPIOIDS.

IN THE U.S., ACUTE APPENDICITIS AFFECTS > 280,000 INDIVIDUALS AND CONTRIBUTES TO 1 MILLION PATIENT DAYS OF ADMISSION EACH YEAR. SURGICAL SITE INFECTION (SSI) RATES FOLLOWING APPENDECTOMY FOR UNCOMPLICATED, NON-PERFORATED APPENDICITIS REMAIN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH. A RECENT REVIEW REPORTED PELVIC ABSCESS RATES OF 9.4% FOLLOWING APPENDECTOMY. THE HIGHEST RISKS FOR MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION OF THE PERITONEUM OCCUR WHEN THE APPENDIX IS TRANSECTED. REGARDLESS OF SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, THE RETAINED APPENDICEAL STUMP ALWAYS EXPOSES APPENDICEAL MUCOSA AND LUMINAL BACTERIA TO THE NORMALLY STERILE PERITONEAL CAVITY. IT IS THUS CRITICAL THAT OPTIMAL ANTIBIOTIC TISSUE EXPOSURE OCCURS DURING THIS OPERATIVE RISK WINDOW. ANTIBIOTIC INTERVENTION FOR ACUTE APPENDICITIS IS COMPLEX. THERAPEUTIC ANTIBIOTICS ARE INITIATED EMPIRICALLY IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, OFTEN HOURS BEFORE THE APPENDECTOMY (USUALLY A 4-18 HOUR WAIT). THUS, AT THE TIME OF SURGERY, THERE ARE ALREADY THERAPEUTIC ANTIBIOTICS ON BOARD, AND THE ROLE OF PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS IS UNCLEAR. TO DATE, THERE HAS BEEN NO CONSENSUS ON THE BLENDED USE OF THERAPEUTIC AND PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS FOR ACUTE SURGERIES, AND IN MANY CASES, PROPHYLAXIS IS NOT ADMINISTERED BECAUSE THERAPEUTIC ANTIBIOTICS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADMINISTERED. UNFORTUNATELY, IN THESE INSTANCES ANTIBIOTIC TISSUE LEVELS ARE LIKELY BELOW THE MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION AT THE TIME OF APPENDICEAL TRANSECTION DUE TO THE SHORT HALF-LIFE AND LACK OF PROTOCOLED DOSE TIMING RELATIVE TO SURGICAL INCISION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE APPENDIX, A KNOWN MICROBIOME RESERVOIR FOR THE COLON, HAS ITS LUMEN OPEN TO THE PERITONEUM DURING APPENDECTOMY, GUARANTEEING SOME LEVEL OF TISSUE AND PERITONEAL MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION DURING THE SURGERY, INCREASING RISK FOR SSI AND ABSCESS FORMATION.

NATIONAL GUIDELINES STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT CHILDREN WITH SICKLE CELL ANEMIA RECEIVE ROUTINE SCREENINGS AND BE OFFERED PREVENTIVE MEDICATIONS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING INFECTIONS, STROKES, AND PAIN CRISES. ALTHOUGH THESE COMPLICATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION AND COST, AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE, ONLY 40% OF CHILDREN RECEIVE ROUTINE SCREENINGS AND LESS THAN 20% RECEIVE PREVENTIVE MEDICATIONS.

THE SEGIP PLAN COVERS 130,000 STATE EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS ACROSS THE STATE, WHICH INCLUDES DENSE URBAN CENTERS AND REMOTE RURAL AREAS. EACH YEAR SEGIP EMPLOYEES SELECT A PRIMARY CARE \u201cGATEKEEPER\u201d CLINIC THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING THE ENTIRETY OF THEIR CARE, INCLUDING REFERRALS TO SPECIALISTS AND HOSPITALS, AND PHARMACEUTICALS. CLINICS ARE ASSESSED ON THEIR RISK-ADJUSTED TOTAL COST OF CARE AND PLACED INTO ONE OF FOUR COST-SHARING TIERS. THE COST-SHARING DIFFERENTIALS ARE SUBSTANTIAL, GIVING CONSUMERS A STRONG INCENTIVE TO CHOOSE LOWER-COST CLINICS.  WE HAVE ADDRESSED SOME OF THE INITIAL QUESTIONS REGARDING CONSUMER RESPONSES TO TIERING IN RESEARCH FUNDED BY THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON AND DONAGHUE FOUNDATIONS. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE MOVE TO THE NEXT STEP TO INVESTIGATE RESPONSES OF CLINIC LEADERS TO INCLUSION IN A TIERED COST-SHARING SYSTEM. WE WILL USE BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS AS PART OF A TRIANGULATION MIXED METHODS DESIGN. OUR RESEARCH WILL ASSESS WHAT ACTIONS CLINIC LEADERS HAVE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO INCLUSION IN A TIERED COST-SHARING SYSTEM, HOW THEY THINK STRATEGICALLY ABOUT TIERED COST-SHARING, AND WHAT BARRIERS THEY FACE AS THEY TRY TO PRACTICE MORE EFFICIENTLY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null,

COORDINATION - MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES =65 YEARS OLD WHO ARE AT RISK FOR INCIDENT OR RECURRENT CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS OFTEN HAVE PHYSIOLOGIC PROBLEMS AFFECTING MULTIPLE ORGAN SYSTEMS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO RECEIVING AMBULATORY CARE FROM PROVIDERS IN DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES. ALTHOUGH RECEIVING CARE FROM MULTIPLE PROVIDERS MAY BE CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE, GAPS IN COMMUNICATION AMONG PROVIDERS ARE COMMON, WHICH CAN BE HAZARDOUS FOR PATIENTS. ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS (ACOS) OFTEN EMPLOY \u201cCARE COORDINATORS\u201d (TYPICALLY WITH BACKGROUNDS IN NURSING OR SOCIAL WORK) WHO FACILITATE COMMUNICATION AMONG THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN A PATIENT\u2019S CARE. HOWEVER, ACOS TYPICALLY HAVE THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS AND ONLY A FEW CARE COORDINATORS. HOW TO OPTIMALLY ALLOCATE CARE COORDINATORS IS NOT KNOWN. THE USUAL APPROACH HAS BEEN TO ASSIGN CARE COORDINATORS TO PATIENTS AFTER A HOSPITAL DISCHARGE. WHILE THIS IS REASONABLE, IT ASSUMES THAT ALL DISCHARGED PATIENTS NEED CARE COORDINATION (WHICH THEY MAY NOT), AND IT HAS THE DISADVANTAGE OF WAITING UNTIL AFTER A HOSPITALIZATION HAS OCCURRED. MEANWHILE, PATIENTS ARE OFTEN AWARE OF WHEN THEIR CARE IS NOT BEING WELL COORDINATED, YET NO EXISTING INTERVENTION LEVERAGES THESE OBSERVATIONS. A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WILL DETERMINE THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO APPROACHES FOR ASSIGNING CARE COORDINATORS TO PATIENTS: (A) A NOVEL PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH THAT ASSIGNS CARE COORDINATORS TO THOSE WHO PERCEIVE A PROBLEM WITH CARE COORDINATION VS. (B) USUAL CARE (I.E., AFTER HOSPITAL DISCHARGE). THE RESEARCH AIMS ARE TO: (1) DETERMINE THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TWO APPROACHES ON THE COMBINED OUTCOME OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT OR HOSPITALIZATION OVER 12 MONTHS OF FOLLOW-UP, AND (2) MEASURE IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES (ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, FIDELITY, AND EFFICIENCY) TO INFORM A FUTURE MULTI-CENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE PILOT TRIAL WILL INCLUDE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES =65 YEARS OLD (N = 400 TOTAL, OR 200 PER TRIAL ARM) WHO ARE ATTRIBUTED TO AN ACO, HAVE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE OR =1 CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS, AND HAD HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AMBULATORY CARE IN THE PAST YEAR (AS A RISK FACTOR FOR GAPS IN COMMUNICATION). LISA KERN, MD, MPH (PI) IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCHER WHO IS EXPERT IN AMBULATORY CARE QUALITY AND WHO HAS SPENT HER CAREER TO DATE CONDUCTING INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF OTHERS\u2019 INTERVENTIONS AND OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES OF HER OWN. THIS K18 AHRQ MENTORED CAREER ENHANCEMENT AWARD FOR ESTABLISHED INVESTIGATORS IN PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH WOULD ALLOW DR. KERN TO TRANSITION TO A CAREER OF DESIGNING, IMPLEMENTING, AND EVALUATING HER OWN INTERVENTIONS, THROUGH LEARNING PRAGMATIC CLINICAL TRIALS (TRAINING AIM 1) AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE (TRAINING AIM 2). DR. KERN\u2019S MENTORING TEAM HAS EXPERTISE IN PRAGMATIC CLINICAL TRIALS, IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, CARE COORDINATION, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND BIOSTATISTICS.

"DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF AN INTERVENTION TO FACILITATE SHARED DECISION-MAKING IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN PRESENTING TO THE COMMUNITY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SETTING - PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT: CANDIDATE: DR. COURTNEY MANGUS IS A PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE (EM) PHYSICIAN AND HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN (U-M) MEDICAL SCHOOL. SHE IS INTERESTED IN IDENTIFYING AND TESTING WAYS TO IMPROVE DIAGNOSTIC SAFETY AND PATIENT ENGAGEMENT VIA SHARED DECISION-MAKING (SDM) IN THE COMMUNITY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) SETTING, WHICH IS UNDER-RESOURCED COMPARED TO TERTIARY CARE EDS. HER GOAL IS TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR AND LEADER IN THE FIELD, IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR CHILDREN EVALUATED FOR COMMON PEDIATRIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS ABDOMINAL PAIN, IN COMMUNITY EDS. RESEARCH CONTEXT: THE MOST COMMON PEDIATRIC SURGICAL EMERGENCY, APPENDICITIS, IS IDEALLY DIAGNOSED WITH ULTRASONOGRAPHY. HOWEVER, 85% OF CHILDREN SEEK CARE IN COMMUNITY EDS, WHICH OFTEN HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES. AS SUCH, CHILDREN PRESENTING WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN IN THIS SETTING ARE MORE LIKELY TO UNDERGO COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT). CT IMAGING IS THE MOST SENSITIVE DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR APPENDICITIS, BUT IT EXPOSES CHILDREN TO IONIZING RADIATION AND ULTIMATELY INCREASES THEIR RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER. RISK STRATIFICATION TOOLS EXIST TO HELP CLINICIANS DETERMINE WHICH CHILDREN WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN REQUIRE IMAGING, BUT FOR THE ~50% CHILDREN IN COMMUNITY EDS WHO FALL INTO THE GROUP OF INTERMEDIATE RISK FOR APPENDICITIS, CLINICIANS OFTEN FACE A DILEMMA REGARDING NEXT DIAGNOSTIC STEPS. DATA SUGGEST MOST CLINICIANS CHOOSE EITHER 1) CT IMAGING OR 2) WATCHFUL WAITING (OBSERVATION OR DISCHARGE WITH SCHEDULED FOLLOW-UP). BECAUSE THIS DILEMMA IS SO COMMON, A SYSTEMATIC, FAMILY-CENTERED APPROACH IS NEEDED TO COMMUNICATE DIAGNOSTIC OPTIONS, INCLUDING RISKS/BENEFITS, AND ENGAGE FAMILIES IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INTERVENTION TO FACILITATE SDM IN THIS SCENARIO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY CT SCANS AND INCREASE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IN THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS. RESEARCH AIMS: IN THIS PROJECT, DR. MANGUS WILL UTILIZE AN ITERATIVE, USER-CENTERED DESIGN APPROACH TO DEVELOP AND REFINE A RISK- TAILORED INTERVENTION TO FACILITATE SDM IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF PEDIATRIC ABDOMINAL PAIN IN THE COMMUNITY ED SETTING (AIMS 1A/1B) AND PILOT THE INTERVENTION VIA A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF 100 ED PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF APPENDICITIS TO A COMMUNITY ED (AIM 2). THE RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED AT HURLEY MEDICAL CENTER (HMC), A COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IN FLINT, MICHIGAN, WHICH SERVES A LARGE POPULATION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY AND LOW-INCOME CHILDREN (AHRQ PRIORITY POPULATIONS). CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: DR. MANGUS WILL UNDERTAKE THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PLAN UNDER THE EXPERT MENTORSHIP OF DRS. MAHAJAN, MANOJLOVICH, SCHOENFELD AND SINGH. HER CAREER DEVELOPMENT CURRICULUM IS FOCUSED ON MIXED METHODS RESEARCH, TRAINING IN SDM INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT, AND CLINICAL TRIAL METHODOLOGY. THE PROPOSAL UTILIZES THE RESOURCES OF THE U-M DEPARTMENT OF EM, U-M\u2019S CENTER FOR BIOETHICS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES IN MEDICINE, THE U-M INSTITUTE FOR HEALTHCARE POLICY AND INNOVATION, AND HMC.

AS A RESULT, CURRENT GUIDELINES EMPHASIZE IMMEDIATE ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIBIOTICS FOR ALL PATIENTS WITH SUSPECTED SEPSIS, EVEN THOUGH ANTIBIOTICS WILL NOT BENEFIT PATIENTS WITH PURE VIRAL SEPSIS AND MAY CAUSE HARM AT BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION LEVELS. HOWEVER, THE CONTRIBUTION OF VIRUSES TO THE OVERALL BURDEN OF SEPSIS IS POORLY CHARACTERIZED, AND IMPORTANT QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT ANTIBIOTIC UTILIZATION PATTERNS AND POTENTIAL ANTIBIOTICS-ASSOCIATED HARMS IN THIS POPULATION. THE PROPOSED PROJECT SEEKS TO PROVIDE RIGOROUS ESTIMATES OF THE PROPORTION OF COMMUNITY-ONSET SEPSIS CAUSED BY RESPIRATORY VIRUSES, DESCRIBE CURRENT ANTIBIOTIC UTILIZATION IN VIRAL SEPSIS, QUANTIFY POTENTIAL ANTIBIOTIC-ASSOCIATED HARMS, AND IDENTIFY PATIENT SUBGROUPS IN WHOM ANTIBIOTICS CAN SAFELY BE LIMITED. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE PROPOSAL IS TO PROMOTE SAFER, MORE NUANCED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH SEPSIS, IN LINE WITH AHRQ\u2019S STATED PRIORITIES OF IMPROVING PATIENT SAFETY AND AVOIDING HARM. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL BY USING LARGE DATASETS WITH RICH CLINICAL DATA FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) AT OVER 200 DIVERSE HOSPITALS, A VALIDATED EHR-BASED APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING SEPSIS, AND SOPHISTICATED CAUSAL INFERENCE STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS CONFOUNDING IN ORDER TO PURSUE THREE AIMS: (1) DETERMINE THE FRACTION OF COMMUNITY- ONSET SEPSIS ATTRIBUTABLE TO RESPIRATORY VIRUSES AND CHARACTERIZE ANTIBIOTIC USE AND PREDICTORS OF PROLONGED ANTIBIOTICS IN THIS POPULATION; (2) ASSESS HOSPITAL-LEVEL VARIATION IN ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIBING FOR PATIENTS WITH VIRAL SEPSIS AND EVALUATE RISK-ADJUSTED OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS AT HIGH- VERSUS LOW- UTILIZATION HOSPITALS; AND (3) ASSESS THE POTENTIAL UTILITY OF THE COMBINATION OF POSITIVE VIRAL ASSAY AND LOW PROCALCITONIN LEVEL AS AN INDICATOR THAT ANTIBIOTICS CAN SAFELY BE WITHHELD OR RAPIDLY DISCONTINUED.

THE CANDIDATE, DR. SANJAT KANJILAL, HAS IDENTIFIED TWO IMPORTANT CLINICAL PROBLEMS WHERE IMPROVED RISK PREDICTION FOR AMR COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON QUALITY OF CARE. THE FIRST IS THE OVERUSE OF BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS IN PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH COMMUNITY-ONSET SEPSIS. TO ADDRESS THIS, THE CANDIDATE WILL DEVELOP A SET OF MACHINE LEARNING PREDICTION MODELS TRAINED ON ROUTINELY COLLECTED DATA IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD TO HELP CLINICIANS IDENTIFY WHICH ANTIBIOTIC(S) WILL EFFECTIVELY TREAT THE PATIENT'S PATHOGEN WHILE BEING OF THE NARROWEST POSSIBLE SPECTRUM. THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THE INABILITY TO ASSESS THE RISK OF A PATIENT DEVELOPING AN ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT INFECTION AFTER BEING TREATED WITH AN ANTIBIOTIC. THE CANDIDATE PROPOSES TO BUILD A ROBUST CAUSAL INFERENCE MODEL USING TARGETED MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION COMBINED WITH MACHINE LEARNING TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF TAKING VARIOUS COMMONLY USED OUTPATIENT ANTIBIOTICS ON THE RISK OF DEVELOPING A DRUG RESISTANT INFECTION IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD AFTER TREATMENT.

BRADY POST\u2019S LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO EXPLAIN HOW SYSTEM-LEVEL INTEGRATION AFFECTS QUALITY AND EQUITY, SPECIFICALLY FOR RURAL RESIDENTS. THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS MOVED QUICKLY TOWARD GREATER INTEGRATION BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS. AS A WAY TO ORGANIZE HEALTHCARE SERVICES, HOSPITAL-PHYSICIAN INTEGRATION HAS GENERATED MUCH CONTROVERSY WITHIN THE HEALTH POLICY COMMUNITY. ADVOCATES HOPE FOR MORE EFFICIENCY AND CARE COORDINATION WHILE SKEPTICS RAISE CONCERNS OVER COSTS AND QUALITY. THIS PRESSING POLICY ISSUE, POISED TO BE A DEFINING ISSUE IN HEALTH CARE FOR DECADES TO COME, REQUIRES DEDICATED SCHOLARS. DR. BRADY POST HAS FOCUSED HIS SCHOLARSHIP ON THIS TOPIC SINCE HIS DOCTORAL STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND HE CONTINUES TO BUILD THE EVIDENCE BASE AS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY. A NATURAL NEXT STEP IN HIS CAREER IS TO ADVANCE THE SCIENCE ON HOSPITAL-PHYSICIAN INTEGRATION USING A MORE SOPHISTICATED SET OF METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES THAT WILL ROUND OUT HIS SKILLSET AND, SIMULTANEOUSLY, HELP TO FILL PERSISTENT GAPS IN THE LITERATURE. THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PLAN THAT INCLUDES FORMAL COURSEWORK AND MENTORED, PROJECT-BASED LEARNING, THIS PROJECT WILL EQUIP DR.

THIS UNIQUE COMBINATION WILL POSITION DR. POST TO DIRECT INNOVATIVE STUDIES OF HOW HOSPITAL-PHYSICIAN INTEGRATION RESHAPES HEALTH CARE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THIS TRAINING WILL BUILD HIS SKILLS AS AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER AND PREPARE HIM TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE FOR R01-LEVEL GRANTS. THIS PROJECT WILL EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF HOSPITAL-PHYSICIAN INTEGRATION ON CARE COORDINATION, PATIENT ACCESS TO CARE, AND DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES ACROSS RURAL AND URBAN AREAS. IT WILL LEVERAGE RICH SURVEY DATA TO HIGHLIGHT PATIENTS\u2019 PERSPECTIVES AND USE IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS TO HIGHLIGHT PHYSICIANS\u2019 AND MANGERS\u2019 PERSPECTIVES. WITH THIS AWARD, DR.

BREAST CANCER IS THE MOST COMMON CANCER IN WOMEN, WITH APPROXIMATELY 280,000 NEW CASES DIAGNOSED EACH YEAR. BREAST CANCER TREATMENT DECISIONS ARE COMPLEX AS THERE ARE OFTEN SEVERAL CLINICALLY VIABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE, EACH WITH DIFFERING RISKS, BENEFITS, AND IMPLICATIONS ON THE PATIENT\u2019S LIFE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO INVOLVE PATIENTS IN THIS PREFERENCE-SENSITIVE DECISION, YET, APPROXIMATELY 50% OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS DO NOT MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS REGARDING TREATMENT, AND PATIENTS REPORT ONLY KNOWING HALF OF THE INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE DECISION. POOR UNDERSTANDING OR INSUFFICIENT PARTICIPATION IN THE TREATMENT DECISION MAKING PROCESS CAN LEAD TO POOR PATIENT OUTCOMES, REDUCED PATIENT SATISFACTION, AND HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS. WE PROPOSE THAT A COMPUTERIZED PATIENT-CENTERED COLLABORATIVE TECHNOLOGY (COMPACT), DESIGNED WITH HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING (HFE) APPROACHES, CAN IMPROVE PERSONALIZED BREAST CANCER DECISION MAKING AND PATIENT OUTCOMES. DURING THIS 4- YEAR PROJECT, WE WILL DESIGN AND TEST THE COMPACT SYSTEM USING HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN (HCD).

FORMATIVE USABILITY TESTING AND A HEURISTIC EVALUATION WILL IDENTIFY DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROTOTYPES. THE PI WILL DEVELOP SKILLS IN PATIENT-FACING HIT AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE.  RESEARCH AIM 3 IS THE EVALUATION OF COMPACT IN A SCENARIO-BASED SIMULATION. SCENARIO-BASED SIMULATIONS WITH POTENTIAL BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS (INDIVIDUALLY AND IN GROUPS) USING COMPACT UNDER REALISTIC CONDITIONS WILL EVALUATE COMPACT\u2019S POTENTIAL USEFULNESS, USABILITY, AND ACCEPTANCE.

YET TAILORING IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND BURDENSOME TO BE USED IN PRACTICE AND IS EVEN LESS FEASIBLE WITH THE RAPID TELEHEALTH EXPANSION. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO TAILORING TO ENABLE PRIMARY CARE CLINICS TO RAPIDLY ADAPT HOW THEY IMPLEMENT CVD GUIDELINES AFTER TELEHEALTH EXPANSION TO AVOID WORSENING DISPARITIES. IN ENGINEERING, CONFIGURABLE SOLUTIONS MAKE MENUS OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO AVOID EXPENSIVE INDIVIDUAL TAILORING. THIS APPROACH COULD ENABLE CLINICS TO USE KNOWN STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS LOCAL BARRIERS WITHOUT ENGAGING IN AN EXPERT-LED INDIVIDUAL TAILORING PROCESS. PRELIMINARY QUALITATIVE WORK FOUND MANY BARRIERS TO OPTIMAL CARE WITH TELEHEALTH THAT ARE MODIFIABLE WITH KNOWN STRATEGIES.

THE PROTECTED TIME SUPPORTED BY THIS FOUR-YEAR AWARD WILL ALLOW ME TO ACQUIRE NEW SKILLS AND DEVELOP EXPERTISE IN HEALTHCARE DELIVERY INTERVENTIONS AND HAS THE FOLLOWING MAIN GOALS: 1) OBTAIN TRAINING IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY INTERVENTIONS, INTERVENTIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS, AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, AND 2) PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, I HAVE ESTABLISHED A MENTORING TEAM COMPRISED OF A SENIOR INVESTIGATOR IN CANCER CLINICAL RESEARCH (DR. BERENBERG, PRIMARY MENTOR), A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT IN INTERVENTIONAL TRIALS (DR. HERSHMAN), A NATIONAL LEADER IN CANCER HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH (DR. HOLCOMBE), AND FACULTY WITH EXPERTISE IN BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION (DR. CASSEL) AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE (DR. OKAMOTO). THESE MENTORS AND TWO CONSULTING MEMBERS WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE PROPOSED TRAINING AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO FACILITATE MY TRANSITION FROM A JUNIOR RESEARCHER TO AN INDEPENDENT HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCHER. ALTHOUGH ADVANCES IN TREATMENT HAVE IMPROVED OVERALL SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER, DEATH RATES FROM ALL CANCERS AMONG RURAL RESIDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE 10% HIGHER THAN THOSE LIVING IN URBAN AREAS. HIGHER CANCER MORTALITY RATES IN RURAL AREAS ARE THOUGHT TO, IN PART, REFLECT LIMITED ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CANCER CARE. A POTENTIAL STRATEGY TO REDUCE THESE DISPARITIES IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY CANCER CLINICAL TRIAL CARE IN RURAL AREAS; HOWEVER, THERE ARE NUMEROUS BARRIERS TO CLINICAL TRIAL ENROLLMENT IN RURAL AREAS. TO ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS, IN COLLABORATION WITH MY MENTORING TEAM, I WILL DEVELOP AND PILOT TEST CTNOW, A MULTI- COMPONENT, MULTILEVEL INTERACTIVE ELECTRONIC TOOL THAT COMBINES PATIENT AND PROVIDER CANCER CLINICAL TRIAL EDUCATION AND A REAL-TIME VIDEOCONFERENCE SYSTEM THAT ENABLES RURAL PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS TO ACCESS A CLINICAL TRIAL TEAM FOR CONSULTATION, REFERRAL, AND CLINICAL TRIAL ENROLLMENT. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH HAS THE FOLLOWING AIMS: 1) CONDUCT A FORMATIVE MIXED-METHODS EVALUATION WITH RURAL ONCOLOGY PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS TO ASSESS CAPABILITIES AND THE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS OF THE RURAL INTERVENTION SETTINGS, 2) DEVELOP AND PILOT TEST CTNOW FOR RURAL PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS, AND 3) IDENTIFY REMAINING BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO RURAL CLINICAL TRIAL PARTICIPATION AND STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION OF CTNOW. MY TRAINING AND RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED AT ONE OF THE 71 NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE-DESIGNATED CANCER CENTERS WITH A WELL-ESTABLISHED PROGRAM IN CANCER CARE DELIVERY RESEARCH. DURING YEARS 3 AND 4, I WILL DEVELOP AND SUBMIT AN R01 APPLICATION TO PROPOSE A MULTI-SITE, HYBRID EFFECTIVENESS- IMPLEMENTATION STUDY CONDUCTED THROUGH RURAL NCORP SITES. MY CURRENT AND FUTURE RESEARCH AIMS ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH AHRQ\u2019S MISSION TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY IN A HIGH PRIORITY POPULATION RESIDING IN RURAL AREAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "HI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7997b0e4-1373-a617-5e8b-0e0e80c459d7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K01HS028730_7528"}, {"internal_id": 147541148, "Award ID": "K01HS028529", "Award Amount": 295925.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-03-28", "CFDA Number": "93.226", "Description": "EVALUATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HIGH INTENSITY HOME-BASED REHABILITATION FOLLOWING STROKE - PROJECT SUMMARY STROKE IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT CONDITION THAT CONTRIBUTES TO SIGNIFICANT DEFICITS IN FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY, PARTICULARLY IN OLDER ADULTS. TO ADDRESS THESE DEFICITS, POST-ACUTE REHABILITATION IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED COMPONENT OF CARE. HOWEVER, FACILITY-BASED REHABILITATION (I.E., IN A SKILLED NURSING OR INPATIENT REHABILITATION FACILITY) IS COSTLY. IF STROKE PATIENTS CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME OUTCOMES IN A HIGH-INTENSITY HOME-BASED REHABILITATION (HIHR) APPROACH AS IN THESE FACILITIES, THE RELATIVE VALUE (OUTCOMES/COSTS) WOULD BE GREATER. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH AN APPROACH HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. FURTHER, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A HIHR CARE MODEL HAS NOT BEEN EXAMINED IN THE US HEALTH SYSTEM. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO INITIAL HIHR EFFORTS IMPLEMENTATION IN ONE HEALTH SYSTEM AND TO UNDERSTAND ITS CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS TO INFORM SUBSEQUENT IMPROVEMENT OF THE CARE MODEL. A HYBRID TYPE 2 STUDY DESIGN WITH A TRIANGULATED MIXED METHODS APPROACH WILL BE USED OVER TWO CYCLES OF A LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEM RESEARCH FRAMEWORK. SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO (1) EXPLORE BARRIERS AFFECTING THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF HIHR FOR STROKE PATIENTS, (2) COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HIHR TO FACILITY-BASED REHABILITATION ON IMPROVING PATIENTS' FUNCTION, AND (3) IMPLEMENT A REFINED HIHR MODEL AND RE- EXAMINE ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT CLINICAL WORKFLOW CHALLENGES AND PATIENT/CAREGIVER PREFERENCES WILL AFFECT THE OUTCOMES WITH INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT PATIENTS' FUNCTION AT HIHR DISCHARGE WILL BE AT LEAST EQUIVALENT TO PATIENTS' FUNCTION AT FACILITY DISCHARGE. WE ALSO HYPOTHESIZE THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OUTCOMES WILL BE ACHIEVED BY REFINING THE HIHR MODEL AFTER LEARNING FROM THE EVALUATION OF THE INITIAL MODEL. THESE AIMS ALIGN WELL WITH THE CANDIDATE'S GOAL TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEM RESEARCHER, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON STUDYING REHABILITATION PRACTICE IN HEALTH SYSTEMS. TRAINING AIMS ARE TO (1) DEVELOP EXPERTISE IN MIXED METHODS RESEARCH AND ITS APPLICATION TO CARE DELIVERY, (2) GAIN EXPERTISE IN ASSESSING IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS OF A HEALTH SYSTEM INNOVATION, (3) DEVELOP EXPERTISE IN COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH USING OBSERVATIONAL DATA, AND (4) DEVELOP SKILLS TO ENGAGE WITH HEALTH SYSTEM LEADERS AND LEAD A LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEM RESEARCH LAB. THESE TRAINING AIMS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA ONE-ON-ONE MENTORSHIP WITH CONTENT EXPERTS AND COMBINATION OF LOCAL AND NATIONAL COURSEWORK. ALL SCIENTIFIC AND TRAINING AIMS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT INCLUDES A LARGE INTEGRATED ACADEMIC HEALTH SYSTEM AND A PARTNER INSTITUTION FOR DIDACTIC INSTRUCTION.

IN HOSPITALS, ASYMPTOMATIC COLONIZATION IS EMERGING AS A CRITICAL TARGET FOR CRE INFECTION PREVENTION: EPIDEMIOLOGICALLY, EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF COLONIZED PATIENTS CAN REDUCE INTRA-HOSPITAL SPREAD. AND CLINICALLY, COLONIZED INPATIENTS FACE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER \u2014 BUT POTENTIALLY MODIFIABLE \u2014 RISKS OF CRE INFECTION. DUE TO DIAGNOSTIC LIMITATIONS, HOWEVER, WIDESCALE CRE COLONIZATION SCREENING REMAINS IMPRACTICAL FOR MOST U.S. HOSPITALS. PREDICTION MODELS OFFER ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR IDENTIFYING PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK OF COLONIZATION AND OF SUBSEQUENT INFECTION. HOWEVER, MODELS FACE TWO METHODOLOGICAL OBSTACLES, LIMITING THEIR WIDER UTILITY: (1) STRONG COLONIZATION RISK FACTORS ARE \u201cLOCKED\u201d IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) FREE-TEXT THAT IS UNAVAILABLE FOR MODEL-BUILDING UNLESS RECORDS ARE REVIEWED MANUALLY; AND (2) DUE TO LOW CRE PREVALENCE, MOST STATISTICAL MODELS CAN ONLY EVALUATE LIMITED NUMBERS OF CANDIDATE VARIABLES.

WE WILL APPLY THESE METHODS TO EHRS FROM >21,000 PATIENTS SCREENED FOR CRE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AND THE JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITALS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL BUILD AND VALIDATE NLP ALGORITHMS ON ADMISSION HISTORIES TO DETECT PRE-ADMISSION EXPOSURES THAT ARE STRONG COLONIZATION RISK FACTORS BUT POORLY CAPTURED IN STRUCTURED EHR DATA FIELDS. NLP IS A CUTTING-EDGE COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUE FOR \u201cUNLOCKING\u201d THESE TYPES OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA. WE WILL ALSO USE TEXT-MINING APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL NEW OR LOCAL CRE RISK FACTORS. IN AIMS 2 AND 3, WE WILL BUILD AND VALIDATE MODELS FROM NLP-DERIVED VARIABLES AND OTHER EHR DATA TO PREDICT COLONIZATION AT ADMISSION (AIM 2) AND PROGRESSION TO INFECTION (AIM 3) USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT EXCEL ON HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA. TAKEN TOGETHER, THIS WORK WILL HELP HOSPITALS IDENTIFY PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK OF CRE COLONIZATION AND INFECTION EARLY, WHEN DELETERIOUS PATIENT OUTCOMES ARE STILL PREVENTABLE. BECAUSE NLP IS AUTOMATED, SUCCESSFUL MODELS COULD BE EXPORTED TO OTHER HOSPITALS AND INTEGRATED INTO EHRS; ALL ALGORITHMS RESULTING FROM THIS WORK WILL BE MADE FREELY AVAILABLE.

DESPITE THE DEMONSTRATED EFFECTIVENESS OF CI-BPC, THERE REMAIN CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAPS REGARDING PROGRAM DESIGN AND COSTS. THUS, THE SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS K01 APPLICATION IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EFFECTIVE CI-BPC PROGRAM AND DETERMINE THE ESSENTIAL PROGRAM ACTIVITIES, IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT PATIENT-LEVEL AND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS RELEVANT TO IMPLEMENTATION, AND DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CI-BPC FOR PATIENTS, HEALTH SYSTEMS, AND SOCIETY.

THOMPSON, PHD, IS AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST, HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCHER, AND FACULTY MEMBER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CARDIAC SURGERY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. HIS LONG-TERM CAREER GOAL IS TO CONDUCT IMPACTFUL, SIGNIFICANT, AND INNOVATIVE RESEARCH THAT IMPROVES THE VALUE OF CARDIAC SURGERY. THE PROPOSED K01 AWARD APPLICATION INCLUDES A 5-YEAR PLAN FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THIS CAREER GOAL AND BECOME A SUCCESSFUL INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR. BACKGROUND: CARDIAC REHABILITATION (CR) IS A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTION THAT IMPROVES OUTCOMES, BUT HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED. AMONG CARDIAC SURGICAL PATIENTS, CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT CR EXTENDS LIFE, IMPROVES CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PREVENTS DOWNSTREAM HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION. DESPITE THIS EVIDENCE, HALF OF CARDIAC SURGICAL PATIENTS NEVER ATTEND A SINGLE SESSION OF CR, AND ONLY ONE-THIRD OF CR ENROLLEES FINISH THE ENTIRE 36 RECOMMENDED SESSIONS. DISPARITIES IN CR ENROLLMENT ACROSS HAVE ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATED ACROSS PATIENTS, PROVIDERS, AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. IMPROVING CR ENROLLMENT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING ITS FULL POTENTIAL FOR CARDIAC SURGICAL PATIENTS. RESEARCH AIMS: MY LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE VALUE OF CARDIAC SURGICAL CARE. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE: (1) TO IDENTIFY DETERMINANTS OF CR ENROLLMENT AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY, (2) TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF CR ENROLLMENT AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY ON CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES, AND (3) TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ON CR ENROLLMENT AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PROPOSE A SERIES OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES ON A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF CLAIMS DATA AND CLINICAL DATA FROM THE IMPROVE NETWORK, WHICH SHARES DATA AND BEST PRACTICES ACROSS FIVE MULTICENTER CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY COLLABORATIVES COVERING OVER 90 HOSPITALS IN 9 STATES (~10% OF ALL US CARDIAC SURGICAL PROGRAMS).

(2) TO GAIN CAUSAL INFERENCE SKILLS WITH IN-DEPTH COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS AND POLICY EVALUATION COMPONENTS. (3) TO DEVELOP SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE METHODS. IMPACT: FINDINGS FROM THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE EVIDENCE NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NECESSARY EVIDENCE TO APPROPRIATELY EXPAND AND INCENTIVIZE CR ENROLLMENT AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY, WHICH WILL INCREASE THE VALUE OF CARDIAC SURGICAL CARE. THE PROPOSAL IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIVE TO AHRQ\u2019S INTEREST IN (I) GENERATING EVIDENCE THAT WILL INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY, EFFICIENCY, AND QUALITY OF HEALTH AND (II) HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH TO ACHIEVE A HIGH- VALUE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.
