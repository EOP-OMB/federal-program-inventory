THE TWO OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES WE HAVE SELECTED ARE THE DIAGNOSIS OPERATIONAL STRATEGY AND PREVENTION OPERATIONAL STRATEGY. WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES. (1) BY THE END OF THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE, SIHB WILL INCREASE PARTNERSHIPS TO ENGAGE WITH FOUR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO ADVANCE ACCESS TO HIV/HCV/STI TESTING, PREVENTION, CARE AND TREATMENT. (2) TO WORK TOWARD THE NATIONAL PLAN TARGET OF 95% OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV OR HCV KNOWING THEIR STATUS, BY THE END OF THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE SIHB WILL INCREASE HIV TESTING TO 20% OF RELATIVES (BASED ON RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIED THROUGH RISK SCREENING) FROM A BASELINE OF 6.8%. (3) BY THE END OF THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE, INCREASE PREP COVERAGE TO 25% FOR SIHB RELATIVES FOR WHOM PREP IS INDICATED FROM A BASELINE OF 1.5%. TO ADDRESS THE DIAGNOSIS OPERATIONAL STRATEGY, THIS PROJECT WILL OPERATIONALIZE CONSISTENT PATHWAYS TO HIV/HCV/STI TESTING FOR ALL RELATIVES THROUGHOUT OUR CLINICS.

THE CLINIC IS OVERSEEN BY A CONSORTIUM OF SEVEN FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND TWO TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. SINCE 2015, 640 UNDUPLICATED PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH OPIOID USE DISORDER (OUD) HAVE ACCESSED SERVICES AT TIHP. MORE THAN 75% OF TOTAL DEATHS FROM OVERDOSE WITHIN INYO COUNTY IN 2018 WERE ETHNICALLY-IDENTIFIED AS AMERICAN INDIAN. AS RECOVERY SERVICES AND DATA COLLECTION RELATED TO THE PREVALENCE OF OUD REMAIN LIMITED WITHIN TIHP?S SERVICE AREA, THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A COMMUNITY OPIOID INTERVENTION PILOT PROJECT (COIPP) IS ESSENTIAL TO RAISING AWARENESS, PROVIDING EDUCATION TO THE COMMUNITY ON EVIDENCED-BASED TREATMENT AND RECOVERY OPTIONS, AND SUPPORTING THE WORK TO FURTHER DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT (MAT) PROGRAM.WITH COIPP FUNDING, TIHP CAN IMPLEMENT THE TSAWUIDU PROJECT. FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED TO RETAIN CURRENTLY EMPLOYED MAT CHAMPIONS. THE QUALIFIED CONTENT EXPERTS WILL COMPLETE THE ACTIVITIES AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN FACILITATING A SENSITIVE SUBJECT MATTER TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. TO DELIVER CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE HARM REDUCTION EFFORTS, A HARM REDUCTION/OUTREACH SPECIALIST WILL BE ADDED TO THE CURRENT TEAM. THE TSAWUIDU TEAM WILL CONSIST OF A CLINICAL DIRECTOR, PROJECT DIRECTOR, GRANTS COORDINATOR, HARM REDUCTION/OUTREACH SPECIALIST, AND A MEDIA COORDINATOR. THE TEAM WILL DEVELOP SCHEDULED EDUCATIONAL EVENTS AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE FUNDING WILL ALLOW TIHP TO PROVIDE OUTREACH/HARM REDUCTION ACCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS IN ISOLATED AREAS. AS PART OF OUR MISSION TO DELIVER COMMUNITY AC CESS TO OUD EDUCATION AND TIHP RESOURCES, WE WILL CONTINUE TO INTEGRATE INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE RESOURCES THROUGH OUR INNOVATIVE MASS COMMUNICATION EFFORT.

THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION BASED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL?S TREATMENT AND RECOVERY NEEDS, BUT RATHER A STRATEGY THAT EMBRACES A COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED APPROACH TO ADDRESS AND MITIGATE THE IMPACTS ON THE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY AS A RESULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL?S CHOICES.  BUIHWC?S OVERALL GOAL IS TO CREATE A REPLICABLE MODEL THAT WILL MITIGATE KEY VULNERABILITIES OF THE AI/AN POPULATION AND ADDRESS THE GAPS IN CULTURALLY-APPROPRIATE PATIENT CARE. USING A SYSTEMS OF CARE APPROACH, WE INTEND TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY ACROSS THE MICRO (INDIVIDUAL), MESO (FAMILY/PEERS) AND MACRO (HEALTHCARE NETWORK/COMMUNITY PARTNERS) SYSTEM. OUR RELATIONSHIP-BASED CONTINUUM OF CARE MODEL FOCUSES ON HEALTH PROMOTION, PREVENTION EDUCATION, INTERVENTION, TREATMENT, AND RECOVERY; EACH OF WHICH IS VITAL TO THE INTEGRATION AND PROGRESSION OF CARE RECEIVED BY PARTICIPANTS. CURRENT TREATMENT MODELS OFTEN RETAIN PATIENTS WITHIN AN ACTIVE MAINTENANCE STAGE, (TRADING ONE DRUG FOR ANOTHER), FAILING TO MOVE TO AFTERCARE & COMPLETE RECOVERY. FOR THESE REASONS, BUIHWC SEEKS FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT AN INNOVATIVE AND TRANSFORMATIVE TREATMENT MODEL DESIGNED TO A) INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS, HEALTH EDUCATION/DISEASE PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND RECOVERY USING A CULTURAL AND FAMILY CENTERED FRAMEWORK; B) ENGAGE AND EMPOWER SUPPORT MECHANISMS FOR AI/AN INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES TO EFFECTIVELY MITIGATE OPIOID ABUSE; AND C) EFFICIENTLY RESPOND TO THE TREATMENT, AFTERCARE, AND RECOVERY NEEDS OF AI/AN INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES TO REDUCE OPIOID CONSEQUENCES AND OVERDOSE RISKS.ADDRESSING SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION, TREATMENT AND AFTERCARE FROM A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH WILL ENSURE WRAPAROUND CARE TO PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CARE/TREATMENT AND INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF THE COMMUNITY TO PREVENT, AND TREAT OPIOID ADDITION.  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMUNITY-DRIVEN FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES THE AI/AN PATIENT, THEIR FAMILY, AND COMMUNITY NETWORK SUPPORTS AND INTEGRATES TRADITIONAL, HOLISTIC AND WESTERN MEDICINE WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE OPIOID CRISIS BEING EXPERIENCED IN FAR TOO MANY AI/AN COMMUNITIES.
