MANY STATES, INCLUDING TENNESSEE, RECOGNIZE THE GROWING BURDEN OF ADRD AND THE NEED TO PROMOTE CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS TO PROMOTE COGNITIVE HEALTH AND ADDRESS COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. BY 2030, THE NUMBER OF TENNESSEANS 60 YEARS AND OLDER WILL GROW BY 37 PERCENT TO 2.16 MILLION INDIVIDUALS, 28 PERCENT OF THE STATE\u2019S POPULATION.1 WHILE AGING IS AN INEVITABLE PROCESS, RESEARCH SHOWS EVIDENCE THAT IMPLEMENTING HEALTHY BEHAVIORS THROUGHOUT AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S LIFETIME MAY REDUCE THE RISK OF COGNITIVE DECLINE AND DEMENTIA.2 THIS EVIDENCE REQUIRES PUBLIC HEALTH TO TAKE A LIFE-COURSE APPROACH THAT FOCUSES ON REDUCING MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS EARLIER TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH ADRD. THE HEALTHY BRAIN INITIATIVE, DEVELOPED BY THE ALZHEIMER\u2019S ASSOCIATION AND CDC, ENCOURAGES STATES TO FOCUS INTERVENTIONS AND RESOURCES TOWARD REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG POPULATIONS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY ADRD, SUCH AS AFRICAN AMERICANS, HISPANICS, AND WOMEN. IN 2017, RACIAL DISPARITIES IN PREVALENCE OF ADRD IN TENNESSEE AMONG THOSE AGED 65 AND OLDER WERE 12.2 PERCENT FOR NON-HISPANIC WHITES, 14.6 PERCENT FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS, AND 9.2 PERCENT FOR HISPANICS (REFERENCE). IN 2018, ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE WAS THE 6TH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG OUR STATE\u2019S AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AND WAS THE 8TH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR ALL AFRICAN AMERICANS (REFERENCE).

THE 2020 TENNESSEE ALZHEIMER\u2019S AND RELATED DEMENTIA STATE PLAN INCORPORATES MANY OF THE RM SERIES ACTIONS. THE PLAN ESTABLISHES THE ACCOUNTABILITY NECESSARY TO BUILD DEMENTIA-CAPABLE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO ADDRESS ADRD IN TENNESSEE. AS OUTLINED IN THE APPLICATION NARRATIVE, TDH WILL FURTHER UTILIZE DATA, INCLUDING BRFSS, TO INFORM THE UPDATE TO THE 2021 ALZHEIMER\u2019S AND RELATED DEMENTIA STATE PLAN. TDH IDENTIFIED PRIORITY NEEDS FROM THE 2019 EDITION OF THE STATE HEALTH PLAN AND THE 2020 TENNESSEE ALZHEIMER\u2019S AND RELATED DEMENTIA STATE PLAN FOR THIS PROPOSAL WHICH INCLUDE: 1) EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ABOUT BRAIN HEALTH, COGNITIVE AGING AND RISK REDUCTION AWARENESS; 2) BENEFITS OF EARLY AND ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS WITH MANAGEMENT OF COMORBIDITIES; 3) ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT FROM FAITH COMMUNITIES TO INCREASE ATTENTION TO CAREGIVERS HEALTH AND ASSISTANCE NAVIGATING RESOURCES;4) COMPETENT DEMENTIA CARE COMMUNITIES; AND 5) INCREASE SOURCES OF DATA AND SURVEILLANCE. TDH WILL FOCUS ON FIVE CROSS CUTTING, PROJECTS TO CARRY OUT THE RM SUGGESTED ACTIONS AND TO ADDRESS THE PRIORITIES OUTLINED IN THE 2019 EDITION OF THE TENNESSEE STATE HEALTH PLAN AND 2020 TENNESSEE ALZHEIMER\u2019S AND RELATED DEMENTIA STATE PLAN.
