A KEY TENSION ARISES WHEN UNCERTAINTY OR UNPLANNED EVENTS NECESSITATE A SCHEDULE CHANGE. ON ONE HAND  FULL-FEATURED REPLANNING/RESCHEDULING SYSTEMS REQUIRE TIME  MEMORY  AND COMMUNICATIONS NOT AVAILABLE IN MANY SYSTEMS. WHEN FULL REPLANNING IS IMPOSSIBLE OR UNDESIRABLE  A SCHEDULING EXECUTIVE DEPENDS CRUCIALLY ON ITS INTEGRATION WITH A RESCHEDULING SYSTEM. THE SPECIFICS OF INDIVIDUAL MISSIONS DEMAND EXPERTISE ACROSS THIS TRADEOFF SPACE  PROMPTING RECENT ATTENTION TO THE CONTINUUM BETWEEN SCHEDULE EXECUTION AND (RE)COGNITION (FRANK 2017). NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER S PLANNING AND SCHEDULING GROUP (PSG) HAS IDENTIFIED A WORKFLOW THROUGH WHICH STUDENTS AND FACULTY AT HMC WILL COLLABORATE TO DEEPEN UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DESIGN SPACE: + SCENARIO-DEVELOPMENT SHOWING CONTEXTS FOR THESE (RE)SCHEDULING/EXECUTION TRADEOFFS FOR SPECIFIC SPACE MISSIONS. + INTEGRATION AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ON EXISTING SYSTEMS  E.G.  COMPARING PLEXIL WITH ROS'S SMACH AS THE EXECUTIVE  EXPLORATION OF DIFFERENT RESCHEDULING ALGORITHMS  ETC. + INTEGRATION/PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT SCHEDULERS AND EXECUTIVES  E.G.

IN ADDITION  THIS RESEARCH APPROACHES SOME OF GENELAB S GUIDING QUESTIONS AS TO HOW IMPLEMENTATION OF LARGE SCALE DATASET ANALYSES CAN HELP PRODUCE NEW INSIGHTS AND HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. AIM (1): WE PROPOSE TO USE INFORMATICS TO ASK HOW SPACEFLIGHT ALTERS THE PLANT TRANSCRIPTOME AND PROTEOME USING GENELAB DATA. WE WILL THEN COMPARE THESE CHANGES TO RESPONSES TO OTHER STRESSES AND ENVIRONMENTS  (E.G.  PATHOGEN ATTACK OR LIGHT STRESS) WHERE LARGESCALE  PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEPOSITED OUTSIDE OF GENELAB. THESE DATASETS INCLUDE RESPONSES TO PARTIAL GRAVITY AND GRAVITROPISM-RELATED TRANSCRIPTOMES. INTEGRATING SUCH ANALYSES WITH ALLIED DATA  SUCH AS QTL MAPS  WILL ALLOW US TO SPECIFICALLY ASK HOW MANY OF THE SPACEFLIGHT-LINKED CHANGES MAY BE MEDIATED THROUGH ALTERED GRAVITY SENSING AND RESPONSE.

THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSED ANALYSIS WILL GREATLY STRENGTHEN THESE INITIAL FINDINGS AND EXPAND THE RANGE OF MOLECULAR MECHANISMS WE CAN DETECT. AIM (2): THE SECOND ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSED WORK WILL TAKE THE GENES DEFINED FROM THE INFORMATICS IN AIM 1 AND TEST THEIR FUNCTION BY PASSING THEIR MUTANTS THROUGH A SUITE OF PHENOTYPIC ASSAYS. ANALYSES WILL INCLUDE MORPHOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS OF GRAVTIROPIC  THIGMOTROPIC AND CLINOSTAT GROWTH IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPMENT IN SHORT AND LONG-TERM HYPOXIA. THESE STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED USING AUTOMATED IMAGE ANALYSIS TOOLS SUCH AS ROOTNAV  ROOTTRACE AND CUSTOM R-SHINY APPS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPATIBLE WITH RAPID SHARING OF DATA AND ANALYSES VIA THE CLOUD. INFERENCES FROM THESE GROWTH ANALYSES WILL BE COMPARED TO THOSE REVEALED BY QUANTITATIVE PCR RESULTS OF MARKER GENES IDENTIFIED FROM THE CORE SPACEFLIGHT  OXIDATIVE STRESS  HYPOXIA AND GRAVITROPISM TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSES.

THE GILROY LAB HAS A LONG-STANDING COLLABORATION WITH IPLANT/CYVERSE AND COLD SPRING HARBOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RNASEQ ANALYSIS TEACHING TOOLS SUCH AS THE DNASUBWAY GREEN LINE AND THE COLD SPRING HARBOR DNA LEARNING CENTER. EXTENDING THESE APPROACHES TO THE SPECTRUM OF GENELAB S PLANT DATA WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS PROMOTING ACCESS AND UNDERSTANDING. ONE FURTHER APPROACH TO INCREASING ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE NON-SPECIALIST THAT WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP WILL BE THROUGH AN ONLINE TABLEAU OR QLIK-BASED APP.

ASTRONAUTS  FLIGHT CONTROLLERS  MILITARY)  STRESS AND ANXIETY-RELATED PROBLEMS BEFORE  DURING  OR AFTER MISSIONS CAN SERIOUSLY COMPROMISE EFFICIENCY  SAFETY  AND PERFORMANCE.  TO ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES LIKE STRESS  IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAXIMIZE THE PRIVACY  VALIDITY  AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE COUNTERMEASURES USED. TECHNOLOGY-BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS (E.G.  COMPUTER OR WEBBASED PROGRAMS) ARE EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.  THESE PROGRAMS INCREASE AVAILABILITY OF EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT ABLE OR WILLING TO RECEIVE SUCH IN-PERSON TREATMENTS.  OUR PRIOR RESEARCH VALIDATED THE AUTONOMOUS MULTIMEDIA RESILIENCE TRAINING PROGRAM WE CREATED (I.E.  SMART-OP).  RESULTS FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH A STRESSED BUT OTHERWISE HEALTHY SAMPLE (N=66) INDICATED THAT SMART-OP DECREASED PERCEIVED STRESS  IMPROVED PERCEIVED CONTROL OVER STRESS  AND WAS RATED AS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE USEFUL THAN AN ATTENTION CONTROL GROUP THAT RECEIVED MARKETED VIDEOS AND PUBLISHED MATERIAL ON STRESS MANAGEMENT.  SMART-OP WAS ALSO RATED AS EXCELLENT IN TERMS OF USER-FRIENDLINESS  HAD LOW DROPOUT  AND HIGH HOMEWORK ADHERENCE.  WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS  USEFULNESS  AND USABILITY OF SMART-OP WITH A SAMPLE OF FLIGHT CONTROLLERS AT JOHNSON SPACE CENTER BY COMPARING IT TO AN ATTENTION CONTROL GROUP THAT WILL READ INFORMATION AND WATCH VIDEOS ON STRESS MANAGEMENT.  BASED ON SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH THE SFRM WORKING GROUP  WE LEARNED THAT STRESS IS AN AREA OF CONCERN AND MAY IMPACT FLIGHT CONTROLLER PERFORMANCE AND WELL-BEING.  SINCE SMART-OP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PERCEIVED STRESS  INCREASED PERCEIVED CONTROL OVER STRESSORS  AND WAS RATED AS HIGHLY USEFUL  SMART-OP COULD PROVIDE HELPFUL STRESS TRAINING FOR FLIGHT CONTROLLERS.

IT IS UNKNOWN HOW A COMPLEX  MULTIPLE-ION GCR SPECTRUM - AS WILL BE ENCOUNTERED DURING A MARS MISSION - INFLUENCES RODENT COGNITION. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY COUNTERMEASURES THAT CAN REDUCE RISK TO CREW HEALTH OR PERFORMANCE. PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES SUGGEST THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUND CDDO-EA MEDIATES ITS THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS IN COMBATING LUNG DISEASE BY UPREGULATING THE KEY ANTIOXIDANT TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NRF2.

SIGNIFICANCE: IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW A MISSION RELEVANT GCR MIXTURE INFLUENCES COGNITION  AND DETERMINATION OF GCRINDUCED CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR CHANGES ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATE COUNTERMEASURES.

THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK ALSO CONTROLS MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY  PERTURBATION OF WHICH WILL AFFECT LONGER-TERM HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE TIMING OF THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK IS MEASURED ROUTINELY  AS A STANDARD MEASURE OF HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR  DURING LONG-DURATION SPACE MISSIONS TO ENSURE THAT THESE MULTIPLE BRAIN AND BODY SYSTEMS ARE NOT DISRUPTED AND MISALIGNED FROM EITHER EACH OTHER (INTERNAL DESYNCHRONIZATION) OR WITH THE WORK SCHEDULE (EXTERNAL DESYNCHRONIZATION). ONCE MEASURED  AND IF OUT OF PHASE  CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS CAN BE RESYNCHRONIZED TO THE DESIRED TIME USING A NUMBER OF COUNTERMEASURES  INCLUDING BRIGHT LIGHT  MELATONIN  AND POTENTIALLY EXERCISE AND MEAL TIMING. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE COUNTERMEASURES DEPENDS CRITICALLY  HOWEVER  ON THE CIRCADIAN PHASE AT WHICH THEY ARE ADMINISTERED MISTIMED COUNTERMEASURES CAN EXACERBATE CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION  LEADING TO WORSENING OF HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES RATHER THAN IMPROVEMENT. CIRCADIAN PHASE IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED  HOWEVER  VARYING BY UP TO 5 HOURS IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS UNDER STABLE CONDITIONS  AND IS EVEN MORE VARIABLE IN SPACE. TO DATE  NO FEASIBLE METHOD EXISTS TO MEASURE CIRCADIAN PHASE ACCURATELY AND RELIABLY IN REAL-TIME DURING SPACEFLIGHT.

OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM  GEOPHYSICAL EXPLORATION OF THE DYNAMICS AND EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM (GEODES) WILL EXPLORE A SUITE OF NATURAL RESOURCES ON THESE BODIES THROUGH MULTIDISCIPLINARY GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS. GEOPHYSICAL METHODS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING RESOURCES ON EARTH AS THEY PROVIDE A MEANS OF CHARACTERIZING AND MAPPING THE SUB-SURFACE USING DATA GATHERED ON AND ABOVE THE SURFACE. WE FOCUS OUR GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON FOUR ESSENTIAL RESOURCES THAT WILL ENABLE FUTURE HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION: ..1. LAVA TUBES AND VOID SPACES  CAPABLE OF HOSTING PEOPLE AND INFRASTRUCTURE .2. ICY DEPOSITS  THAT CAN BE USED FOR VOLATILE EXTRACTION .3. REGOLITH  WHICH MAY BE A BUILDING MATERIAL BUT ALSO PRESENTS A HAZARD TO HUMAN AND ROBOTIC HEALTH .4. GEOLOGICALLY RECENT VOLCANISM  TECTONISM  AND IMPACTS  WHICH MOBILIZE  CONCENTRATE  AND TRAP VOLATILES AND UNIQUE ROCK CHEMISTRIES. ..THE UNIFYING GOAL OF GEODES IS TO ENABLE IN-SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION (ISRU) OF THESE SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES FOR THESE NATURAL RESOURCES. THE REASON GEOPHYSICAL METHODS HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING RESOURCES ON EARTH IS THAT THESE METHODS PROVIDE A MEANS OF CHARACTERIZING AND MAPPING THE SUB-SURFACE USING DATA GATHERED ON AND ABOVE THE SURFACE. OUR BROAD TEAM HAS EXPERTISE IN ORBITAL GEOPHYSICS AND FIELD GEOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUES THAT WILL BE REQUIRED FOR FUTURE SPACE EXPLORATION. ..CURRENTLY THERE ARE GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MOST EFFECTIVELY TO USE THESE GEOPHYSICAL METHODS FOR SITE EVALUATION ON SSERVI TARGET BODIES  INCLUDING THE MOON  NEAR EARTH ASTEROIDS (NEAS)  AND THE MOONS OF MARS. WHICH GEOPHYSICAL METHODS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR CHARACTERIZATION OF SPECIFIC RESOURCE TARGETS AND WHAT ARE THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE METHODS? HOW CAN WE EFFICIENTLY REDUCE UNCERTAINTIES IN RESOURCE EXPLORATION AND ISRU THROUGH APPLICATION OF DIVERSE GEOPHYSICAL METHODS IN INTEGRATED EXPLORATION SURVEYS? FOR EACH RESOURCE THEME  WHICH SURVEYS SHOULD BE DONE AS PART OF SITE EVALUATION AND CHARACTERIZATION  AND IN WHAT ORDER? WHAT MODELING APPROACHES WILL MAKE THE BEST USE OF THESE EXTREMELY VALUABLE  AND COSTLY  GEOPHYSICAL DATA TO MAXIMIZE INFORMATION GAIN?

ANALOG SITES ON EARTH WILL BE USED BY THE GEODES TEAM TO DEVELOP FOR EACH THEME (A) EXPLORATION STRATEGIES  (B) METHODS OF INTEGRATING MULTIPLE GEOPHYSICAL METHODS  AND (C) MODELING CAPABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY CHARACTERIZE RESOURCES. THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR THE GEODES PROJECT BECAUSE WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RAPID IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTOMATED GEOPHYSICAL DATA COLLECTION  LEADING TO VASTLY IMPROVED RESOLUTION OF GEOPHYSICAL ANOMALIES  AND MUCH MORE EFFICIENT GEOPHYSICAL MODELING CAPABILITY THAN PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. ..GEODES WILL BE DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING AND EXPANDING THE GOALS AND RESOURCES OF SSERVI AS A VIRTUAL INSTITUTE.

NATURAL KILLER (NK)-CELLS ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN ANTI-TUMOR SURVEILLANCE AND VIRAL CONTROL. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY OF NK-CELLS IS IMPAIRED IN ISS CREWMEMBERS DURING THE FLIGHT PHASE OF THE MISSION AND IS ALSO COMPROMISED WHEN NORMAL HUMAN NK-CELLS ARE EXPOSED TO SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY IN VITRO. AS SUCH  IT IS CRITICAL TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF MICROGRAVITY ON THE ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITIES OF NKCELLS IN VIVO TO DETERMINE IF THIS POSES A SERIOUS RISK TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EXPLORATION CLASS MISSION CREW. MOREOVER  IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO START VALIDATING POTENTIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM COUNTERMEASURES IN PREPARATION FOR LONG DURATION MISSIONS. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY ON THE ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY OF HUMAN NK-CELLS AND GD-T CELLS IN VIVO USING A HUMANIZED EXPERIMENTAL MOUSE MODEL. WE WILL ALSO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A POTENTIAL COUNTERMEASURE THAT IS CURRENTLY USED IN ALLOGENEIC AND AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL TRANSPLANT SETTINGS TO BOOST NK-CELL AND GD-T CELL FUNCTION IN VIVO AFTER TRANSPLANT.

THESE TRUST MEASUREMENTS WILL GUIDE SYSTEM DESIGN  PARTICULARLY THE MULTIMODAL INTERACTIONS AND MODE SWITCHING  AS WELL AS HOW TO MITIGATE OVER TRUST AND TRUST RECOVERY. WE WILL USE CONVERSATION ANALYSIS TO MEASURE TRUST AT MULTIPLE TIME-SCALES FROM REAL-TIME INTERACTIONS TO LONGITUDINAL MONITORING OF TRUST OVER A LONG DURATION EXPLORATION MISSION. CONVERSATION ANALYSIS PROVIDES A PROMISING  BUT RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED APPROACH TO MEASURING TRUST. WE PROPOSE A CONVERSATION ANALYSIS AT THE MICRO  MESO  AND MACRO LEVELS WHICH INCLUDES  NOT JUST THE WORDS  BUT ALSO PAUSES AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. SPECIFICALLY  AT THE MICRO-LEVEL  CONVERSATION ELEMENTS INCLUDE  VOICE INFLECTIONS  PAUSES BETWEEN WORKS AND KEYSTROKES  GAZE SHIFTS  AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. THE MESO-LEVEL ANALYSIS INCLUDES WORDS EXCHANGED DURING INTERACTIONS WITH THE VIRTUAL ASSISTANT ALONG WITH OTHER TEAM INTERACTIONS AS THEY RELATE TO THE AUTOMATION. AT THE MACRO LEVEL  CONVERSATIONAL ANALYSIS CONSIDERS INTERACTION TIME  INTERACTION EFFORT  FREQUENCY OF INTERACTION  TURN-TAKING  BARGING IN TENDENCY  AND WHETHER IT IS THE PERSON OR THE VIRTUAL ASSISTANT WHO INITIATES THE INTERACTION. ADDITIONALLY  PRIOR RESEARCH INTO CONVERSATIONAL ANALYSIS INDICATES THERE ARE NOVEL WAYS OF MANAGING OR CALIBRATING TRUST THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION E.G.  MANIPULATING THE TONE AND CADENCE OF THE SYSTEM WHEN USING SPEECH AND THROUGH FACIAL EXPRESSIONS (NASS&BRAVE  2005; DESTENO ET. AL. 2012). DUE TO TIME DELAYS IN COMMUNICATION  LONG DURATION EXPLORATION MISSIONS WILL REQUIRE GREATER CREW AUTONOMY AND GREATER RELIANCE ON AUTOMATION. FOR THIS APPROACH TO WORK TRUST CALIBRATION NEEDS TO BE ENGINEERED INTO THE SYSTEM. TRUST IS A CRITICAL CONSTRUCT THAT MEDIATES HOW WELL HUMAN OPERATORS USE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS  SUCH AS VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS  THAT PROVIDE DECISION SUPPORT. TRUST AFFECTS PEOPLE.S WILLINGNESS TO RELY ON AUTOMATED SYSTEMS IN SITUATIONS THAT HAVE A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY AND RISK. TRUST STRONGLY AFFECTS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN-AGENT COLLABORATION  PARTICULARLY IN THE WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS FROM A VIRTUAL ASSISTANT. KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT TO TRUST AUTOMATION CAN BE FURTHER COMPLICATED BY LACK OF SLEEP  WORKLOAD  TASK RISK  AND TASK COMPLEXITY.

OPERATOR TRUST IS AT A LEVEL WHICH MATCHES THE AUTOMATION'S CAPABILITIES) BECOMES ESSENTIAL TO MISSION EXECUTION. APPROPRIATE CALIBRATION OF TRUST REQUIRES MATCHING THE OPERATORS TRUST TO THE VIRTUAL ASSISTANT.S CURRENT CAPABILITIES. CALIBRATION OF TRUST IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN ONCE  BUT MUST OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE LIFECYCLE OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN OPERATOR AND AUTOMATED SYSTEM (HOFFMAN ET AL.  2009). TRUST IS A DYNAMIC CONSTRUCT THAT CONTINUOUSLY INCREASES AND DECREASES DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS  PRIMARY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM  I.E. HIGHER PERFORMANCE LEADS TO HIGHER TRUST AND VICE VERSA. ALTHOUGH MUCH EFFORT FOCUSSES ON CREATING MORE CAPABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY AUTOMATION  LESS EFFORT HAS CONSIDERED THE EQUALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION OF CREATING TRUSTABLE AUTOMATION. TRUSTABLE AUTOMATION IS AUTOMATION THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE AND THAT NATURALLY PROMOTES CALIBRATED TRUST. THEREFORE  WE AIM TO CREATE TRUSTABLE AUTOMATION BY CONTINUOUSLY MEASURING OPERATORS.

SPACE TRAVEL INCREASES SOLAR PARTICLE RADIATION EXPOSURE WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED ONCE TRAVEL MOVES BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT. THIS INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF HIGH ENERGY PROTONS AND HEAVY IONS SUCH AS 56FE  28SI  AND 16O. THE ADVERSE RISK OF RADIATION-INDUCED HEART FAILURE IS ALSO EVIDENT AS A LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCE OF ACCIDENTAL RADIATION EXPOSURE OR CANCER TREATMENT. SURVIVORS OF CANCER ARE ALSO AT RISK FOR OTHER ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING ABNORMAL PULMONARY FUNCTION  ENDOCRINE DISORDERS  NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT  AND OSTEOPOROSIS. ALL OF THESE ORGAN SYSTEMS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A LOW TURNOVER OF CELLS AND IT IS LIKELY THAT AN ACCELERATED CELL DEATH AND/OR THE FAILURE OF REGENERATION BY THE PLURIPOTENT CELLS MAY BE THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ORGAN FAILURE. ALTHOUGH THIS APPLICATION WILL FOCUS ON HEART FAILURE  OUR FINDINGS WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR MANY ORGAN SYSTEMS. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES OBSERVED DEGRADATION OF CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION IN A MODEL OF COSMIC RADIATION (HIGH-LET) EXPOSURE. MICE WERE EXPOSED TO 50 CGY (FE56) AT 3 MONTHS OF AGE AND THEN STUDIED AT 24 MONTHS OF AGE. DEGRADATION OF CARDIAC FUNCTION WAS EVIDENT BY SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN MYOCARDIAL CONTRACTILITY AND RELAXATION. CONCOMITANT WITH THIS WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN MITOCHONDRIAL AND STEM/PROGENITOR CELL FUNCTION. IN THE PRESENT GROUND BASED APPLICATION  WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF HIGH-LET; TO IDENTIFY THE PATHWAY TO HEART FAILURE  AND EVALUATE THREE DISTINCT PROTOCOLS AS POTENTIAL COUNTERMEASURES. HYPOTHESIS: RADIATION-INDUCED CARDIOMYOPATHY IS THE RESULT OF A CELL SPECIFIC FAILURE. CELL SPECIFIC FAILURE IS THE RESULT OF AN INABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE OF REPAIR/REPLACEMENT THAT ULTIMATELY LEADS TO ACTIVATION OF DEGRADATION PATHWAYS AND ACCELERATED CELL LOSS. THIS STUDY WILL UTILIZE BOTH CULTURED CELLS AS WELL AS SWISS WEBSTER MICE TO BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO CONTROL OR SINGLE HEAVY ION HIGH- LET EXPOSURE GROUPS. PHASE 1 WILL USE SINGLE EXPOSURES TO HIGH-LET EXPOSURE OF 1) 56FE (50 CGY) OR 2) PROTON (200 CGY). PHASE 2 WILL UTILIZE A MIXED FIELD EXPOSURE FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES OF THE HERO ANNOUNCEMENT (80JSC017N0001-BPBA; APPENDIX C). ALL EXPOSURES WILL BE PERFORMED AT THE NASA SPACE RADIATION LABORATORY AT BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY. WE PLAN TO STUDY THREE DISTINCT COUNTERMEASURES INCLUDING 1) MITOTEMPO  2) METFORMIN  3) LISINOPRIL. MITOTEMPO IS AN ANTIOXIDANT THAT PARTITIONS TO THE MITOCHONDRIA. METFORMIN  AN ANTIDIABETIC MAINSTAY  HAS MORE RECENTLY BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT ANTICANCER PROPERTIES. LISINOPRIL  AN INHIBITOR OF THE ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM  HAS BEEN SHOWN TO MITIGATE RADIATION INJURIES FROM LOW-LET EXPOSURE. EVALUATIONS WILL BE MADE ON SEVERAL LEVELS  TO INCLUDE 1) DETERMINATION OF CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION  2) IDENTIFICATION OF CELL SPECIFIC FAILURE  3) INTRACELLULAR DETERMINATION OF DAMAGE FOCUSING ON GENOMIC AND MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DAMAGE. CELL FAILURE IN TERMS OF METABOLIC FAILURE  ACCELERATED SENESCENCE  AS WELL AS DNA DAMAGE WILL BE DETERMINED. A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS IN SPACE BIOLOGY ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING AT NYMC AND COLLABORATIONS AND SHARING OF RESOURCES WILL ENHANCE THE RESEARCH PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM FUNDING THIS APPLICATION. RADIATION INDUCED CARDIOMYOPATHIES ARE OBSERVED MONTHS OR YEARS AFTER EXPOSURE. THE PRESENT APPLICATION WILL SEPARATE THE INSULT FROM THE CONSEQUENCES. OUR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT DEGRADATION OF CARDIAC FUNCTION SIMILAR TO THE ACCELERATED AGING PHENOTYPE OBSERVED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY. IT MAY NOT BE RELEVANT THAT ANY SINGLE CELL DIES BUT THAT THE BALANCE OF CELL DEATH AND CELL REPLACEMENT IS UPSET.

THIS DISPARITY MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE RELATIVE DIFFICULTY OF CONDUCTING ELONGATIONAL EXPERIMENTS RATHER THAN TO THE LACK OF RELEVANCE IN THE POLYMER COMMUNITY. IN FACT  ELONGATIONAL FLOWS HAVE MANY APPLICATIONS IN INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES  AS WELL AS IN THEORETICAL AND NUMERICAL RESEARCH  AS THEY PROVIDE A DISCRIMINATING TEST FOR MODELS AND THEORIES. IN THIS REGARD  THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE SHERE  SHERE II AND SHERE-R EXPERIMENTS OFFER A UNIQUE ADVANTAGE BY ELIMINATING TWO OF THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN EARTHBOUND ELONGATIONAL FLOW EXPERIMENTS: GRAVITY AND THE INABILITY TO OBSERVE THE EVOLUTION OF THE FLOW AT LONG TIME SCALES. THE CAPILLARY THINNING EXPERIMENTS  PERFORMED IN THE ISS  CONSIST OF STRETCHING A PIECE OF FLUID PLACED BETWEEN TWO DISKS AND LETTING SURFACE TENSION DRIVE THE FLUID MOTION. THE SHERE FLIGHT EXPERIMENTS FURTHER INVESTIGATE AND QUANTIFY  FOR THE FIRST TIME  THE TRANSIENT EXTENSIONAL STRESS GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS OF A DILUTE POLYMER SOLUTION AFTER A DEFINED PRESHEAR HISTORY. THE SHERE DATA REVEALED THAT THE EXTENSIONAL VISCOSITY TENDS TO DECREASE WITH AN INCREASING DEGREE OF PRE-SHEAR FOR FIXED EXTENSION RATE. SIMILARLY  A GENERAL TREND THAT WAS OBSERVABLE WAS A SYSTEMATIC REDUCTION IN EXTENSIONAL VISCOSITY WITH INCREASING EXTENSION RATE FOR FIXED PRESHEAR CONDITIONS.

ONE OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES IN THE MODELING OF VISCOELASTIC MATERIALS IS THE SELECTION OF AN APPROPRIATE CONSTITUTIVE MODEL. UNLIKE THE CASE WITH SIMPLE NEWTONIAN FLUIDS; THERE IS NOT AUNIVERSAL CONSTITUTIVE EQUATION CAPABLE OF DESCRIBING THE FLOW OF ALL VISCOELASTIC MATERIAL. IN CONTRAST  WE ARE FACED WITH THE TASK OF DETERMINING WHICH EQUATION(S) DESCRIBES BEST A GIVEN MATERIAL AND/OR PROCESS.

IF WE ARE TO USE PLANTS IN ADVANCED LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS DURING LONG SPACE MISSIONS  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW PLANTS RESPOND TO THESE VARYING CONDITIONS TO ENSURE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY. PLANT GROWTH ON EARTH IS SHAPED IN GREAT PART BY THE FORCE OF GRAVITY  WHILE CONDITIONS OF MICROGRAVITY EXPERIENCED IN SPACE RESULT IN DRAMATIC CHANGES IN ORGAN ORIENTATION AND GROWTH. THE PLANT RESPONSE TO GRAVITY  OR GRAVITROPISM  IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THE GROWTH ANGLE OF ROOT AND SHOOT BRANCHES  AND THEREFORE  IT ALSO IMPINGES IN CROP ARCHITECTURE AND PRODUCTIVITY ON EARTH. THE EFFECTS OF MICROGRAVITY ON PLANT GROWTH AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL IS NOT YET FULLY CHARACTERIZED  AND THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS BY WHICH PLANTS PERCEIVE GRAVITY ARE STILL UNKNOWN. A WEALTH OF STATE-OF-THE-ART GENETIC  IMAGING AND OMICS TOOLS IN THE MODEL PLANT ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA ARE RIPE TO PROVIDE THE CLUES FOR THIS ELUSIVE SYSTEM IN PLANT BIOLOGY  AND NOVEL PLAYERS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN IDENTIFIED.

WHILE STUDIES ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT FOR HALF A CENTURY IN SPACE OR USING SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY ON THE GROUND  THE REPORTED RESULTS ARE CONFLICTING. ALTHOUGH THE REASON FOR THE VARIATION IN RESULTS IS NOT KNOWN  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY BE DUE TO THE DIVERSITY OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS USED BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS AND HARDWARE USED IN THESE STUDIES. FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN HEALTH RISKS IN FUTURE MOON AND MARS MISSIONS  IT IS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN MORE BASIC DATA ON THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR RESPONSES TO COMBINED EFFECTS OF RADIATION AND MICROGRAVITY. TO ESTABLISH A FIRM BASELINE DATABASE  WE PROPOSE TO UNDERTAKE A SYSTEMATIC STUDY ON CULTURED MAMMALIAN CELLS' RESPONSES TO THE SIMULTANEOUS INSULT OF RADIATION AND MICROGRAVITY (BOTH IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM) TO ELUCIDATE THE MOLECULAR SIGNALING PATHWAYS THAT LEAD TO THESE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.

TO STUDY THESE RISKS  NASA IS DEVELOPING THE GCR SIMULATOR THAT WILL BE ABLE TO IRRADIATE CELL OR ANIMAL SAMPLES WITH COMBINATIONS OF IONS KNOWN TO BE PRESENT IN GCR. THIS DEVISE WILL  BY NECESSITY  IRRADIATE THESE SAMPLES AT DOSES AND DOSE RATES CONSIDERABLY HIGH THAN THAT FOUND IN SPACE IN ORDER TO PRODUCE STATISTICALLY MEANINGFUL RESULTS. TO PRODUCE THE BEST SIMULATIONS  DOSE RATES AND EXPOSURE SEQUENCES WILL NEED TO BE OPTIMIZED. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ENDEAVOR TO OPTIMIZE THESE PARAMETERS BY MEASURING THE INDUCTION OF CHROMOSOME ABERRATIONS. MOST OF THESE ABERRATIONS ARE EXCHANGES OF CHROMOSOMAL SEGMENTS THAT COME ABOUT WHEN RADIATION DAMAGE SEVERS CHROMOSOMES. NORMALLY  CELLS CAN REPAIR THESE BREAKS  BUT ON OCCASION  IF TWO OR MORE BREAKS ARE CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER  A MISTAKE CAN BE MADE WHEREBY THE CELL JOINS BREAK ENDS TO INAPPROPRIATE PARTNERS CAUSING AN EXCHANGE OF CHROMOSOMAL SEGMENTS. THE DAMAGE FORMING THESE BREAKS IS CAUSED BY IONIZATIONS ALONG THE PATHS (TRACKS) THAT IONS TAKE AS THEY PASS THROUGH A MEDIUM. WHILE IN SOME CASES  ALL THE BREAKS NECESSARY FOR AN EXCHANGE TO FORM OCCUR ALONG A SINGLE PARTICLE TRACK  IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES  BREAKS ARE FORMED ALONG SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT TRACKS IN A PROCESS REFERRED TO AS TRACK INTERACTION. TRACK INTERACTION EVENTS BECOME IMPORTANT AT HIGHER DOSES WHEN THE NUMBER OF TRACKS PRODUCE DAMAGE THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO INTERACT INCREASES. TRACK INTERACTIONS ARE NOT LIKELY TO OCCUR AT THE DOSES THOUGHT TO BE FOUND IN SPACE BUT WILL CERTAINLY HAPPEN AT THE HIGHER DOSES REQUIRED FOR GCR SIMULATIONS AND POTENTIALLY SKEW THE RESULTS. ONE STRATEGY TO AVOID TRACK INTERACTIONS IS TO LOWER THE DOSE RATE. BY SPACING OUT THE TIME OVER WHICH IONS PASS THROUGH A CELL  BREAKS FORMING EARLY IN THE TIME FRAME HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE REPAIRED BEFORE OTHER BREAKS FORMING SPATIALLY CLOSE ENOUGH TO INTERACT WITH THEM ARRIVE ON THE SCENE. THIS PRODUCES A REDUCTION IN THE FREQUENCY OF CHROMOSOME EXCHANGES. AS THE DOSE RATE DECREASES FURTHER A POINT IS REACHED WHERE VIRTUALLY ALL THE EXCHANGES RESULT FROM SINGLE TRACK ACTION. AT THIS  LIMITING LOW DOSE RATE  NO ADDITIONAL REDUCTION IN CHROMOSOME EXCHANGE FREQUENCY IS POSSIBLE BY FURTHER REDUCTION IN THE DOSE RATE. THESE RESULTS WILL BE DIRECTLY SCALABLE TO THE LOW DOSES AND DOSE RATES PRESENT IN SPACE. SPECIFIC AIM 1 OF OUR PROPOSAL WILL ENDEAVOR TO DETERMINE THE LIMITING LOW DOSE RATE FOR PROTONS AT THE ENERGY STATED IN THE NRA. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY IRRADIATING CELLS WITH A SERIES OF DOSES AT DOSE RATES WE ESTIMATE WILL BE CLOSE TO THE LIMITING LOW DOSE RATE AND LOOKING FOR CHROMOSOME EXCHANGES. WHEN ADDITIONAL REDUCTION IN DOSES RATE FAILS TO PRODUCE ANY FURTHER DECREASE IN EXCHANGES AS A FUNCTION OF DOSE WE WILL BE AT THE LIMITING LOW DOSE RATE. THE GCR SIMULATOR WILL BE IRRADIATING SAMPLES WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ION BEAMS IN ORDER TO BETTER SIMULATE THE NATURE OF THE MIXED ION FIELD FOUND IN SPACE. THE HEAVIER IONS IN THE GCR SPECTRUM WILL BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY FROM THE LIGHTER IONS. THE HEAVY IONS PRODUCE MORE DAMAGE ALONG THEIR TRACKS; SO MUCH SO THAT VIRTUALLY ALL CHROMOSOME EXCHANGES ARE FORMED VIA SINGLE TRACK ACTION. IN THIS CASE WE WILL NEED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL TIME NEEDED FOR REPAIR TO OCCUR BETWEEN IRRADIATIONS WITH THE SUBSEQUENT IONS BEAMS TO AVOID TRACK INTERACTION. SPECIFIC AIM 2 WILL ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BY VARYING THE TIME BETWEEN ION BEAMS. MUCH LIKE THE DOSE RATE EXPERIMENTS  AS WE EXTEND THE TIME BETWEEN IRRADIATIONS  THE PROBABILITY FOR TRACK INTERACTION SHOULD BE REDUCED. ONCE WE REACH A LEVEL WHERE NO FURTHER CHROMOSOME EXCHANGE FREQUENCY REDUCTIONS ARE OBSERVED  WE WILL HAVE REACHED THE OPTIMAL POINT FOR IRRADIATION DELAY.

EVIDENCE HAS ACCUMULATED FROM ANIMAL STUDIES THAT THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM UNDERGOES DELETERIOUS CHANGES AFTER EXPOSURE TO CHARGED PARTICLE RADIATION SUCH AS PROTONS AND HIGH ATOMIC NUMBER ATOMIC NUCLEI THAT ARE FOUND IN SPACE AS GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS AND SOLAR PARTICLE EVENTS. OBSERVED CHANGES INCLUDE INFLAMMATION  OXIDATIVE STRESS  LOSS OF NEURON (DENDRITE) BRANCHES AND CONNECTIONS (SYNAPSES)  ALTERED SIGNALING MOLECULES  ALTERED ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES  LOSS OF BLOOD VESSELS  AND IMPAIRED BEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE. IF HUMANS RESPOND TO CHARGED PARTICLES IN THE SAME WAY AS ANIMALS  THEN IT IS POSSIBLE THAT DELETERIOUS CHANGES MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE COGNITIVE AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL IMPAIRMENTS THAT COULD COMPROMISE SPACEFLIGHT MISSIONS AND ASTRONAUT HEALTH. THE CURRENT EVIDENCE IS BASED PRIMARILY ON SHORT EXPOSURES TO SINGLE RADIATION TYPES. HOWEVER  SPACE RADIATION IS A COMPLEX MIXTURE OF THESE PARTICLES AND EXPOSURES ACCUMULATE GRADUALLY OVER THE COURSE OF MISSIONS. IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED IN RADIATION BIOLOGY THAT REDUCTION OF THE DOSE RATE CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME. THEREFORE  TO BETTER SIMULATE THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT  WE PROPOSE TO EXPOSE ADULT MICE TO EITHER 0.5 GY PROTONS OR 0.25 AND 0.5 GY MIXTURES OF HELIUM  OXYGEN AND SILICON PARTICLES IN 2:1:1 RATIOS AS THEY ARE FOUND IN SPACE. THEN WE WILL DELIVER THE EXPOSURES OVER LONG TIME PERIODS (UP TO 6 WEEKS) IN MULTIPLE SHORT EXPOSURES (FRACTIONS) COMPATIBLE WITH PARTICLE ACCELERATOR OPERATIONS. THESE RESULTS WOULD BE COMPARED TO RESULTS FROM ACUTE EXPOSURES TO ESTABLISH THE DOSE RATE EFFECTIVENESS FACTORS (DREFS) WHICH ARE NEEDED FOR RISK ESTIMATION FOR ASTRONAUT HEALTH. WE PREDICT THAT THE HIGH NUMBERS (FLUENCE) OF PROTONS WILL RESULT IN MULTIPLE TRAVERSALS OF CELLS WITHIN SHORT TIMES THAT MAY ELICIT INTERACTING BIOLOGICAL RESPONSES  WHEREAS THE LOWER FLUENCE OF HIGHER CHARGED IONS WILL RESULT IN RARE INDEPENDENT EVENTS. DREFS>1 ARE PREDICTED FOR PROTONS AND DREFS ~1 ARE PREDICTED FOR HIGH Z PARTICLES. WE WILL ALSO COMPARE THE \"PROTRACTED\" EXPOSURES OF CHARGED PARTICLE MIXTURES TO GAMMA RAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE EQUIVALENT DOSE EFFECTS OR ARE MORE EFFECTIVE. THE RELATIVE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS FACTOR (RBES) WILL BE DERIVED. THESE RBES ARE UTILIZED IN PREDICTING DENSELY IONIZING RADIATION EFFECTS IN HUMANS FOR WHOM ONLY GAMMA RAY AND X-RAY DATA ARE AVAILABLE WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE RATIOS OBTAINED IN ANIMAL MODELS ARE REALISTIC SURROGATES FOR HUMANS.

MOVING BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT AND THE RELATIVE SAFETY OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TOWARD NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS AND MARS PRESENT PREVIOUSLY UNIMAGINABLE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES. ONE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WITHIN WHICH ASTRONAUTS WILL WORK. THIS COMPLEXITY WILL PLACE ENORMOUS DEMANDS ON ASTRONAUTS  AND RESEARCH IS NEEDED THAT DEVELOPS CONCRETE COUNTERMEASURES TO MITIGATE THE RISKS STEMMING FROM PERFORMANCE DECREMENTS DUE TO INADEQUATE COOPERATION  COORDINATION  COMMUNICATION  AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ADAPTATION WITHIN A TEAM.

RESEARCH PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN IS CRITICAL TO MAXIMIZE CREW EFFICIENCY  COMFORT  AND EQUIPMENT STORAGE. DESIGNERS UTILIZE MOCK-UPS EARLY IN THE DESIGN PHASE TO EXPERIMENT WITH IDEAS  BUT HIGH FIDELITY MOCK UPS CAN BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING TO PRODUCE. THEREFORE  MANY DESIGN DECISIONS HAVE BEEN SET IN PLACE BY THE TIME A HIGH FIDELITY MOCK-UP IS CREATED. ENGINEERING DRAWINGS ALLOW EARLY ASSESSMENT OF VEHICLE DESIGN  BUT DO NOT ALLOW EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH THE SYSTEM. FURTHER  WHEN TESTING MOCK-UPS IN 1G  OUR PERSPECTIVE IS LIMITED BY OUR ORIENTATION AND BY INTERACTING WITH THE VEHICLE IN 1G. THIS LIMITATION IS REMOVED IN MICROGRAVITY  WHERE ASTRONAUTS INTERACT WITH THE VEHICLE OR HABITAT IN WAYS NOT POSSIBLE ON EARTH. IT CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR DESIGNERS TO OPTIMIZE SPACES WHEN THINKING AND WORKING IN 1G. TO ENABLE EFFICIENT AND RAPID MOCK-UP OF VEHICLE CONCEPTS  VIRTUAL REALITY CAN BE USED EARLIER IN THE DESIGN PROCESS TO ACHIEVE IMPROVED SYSTEM DESIGN. SPECIFIC AIM 1: CREATE A VIRTUAL REALITY DESIGN TOOL FOR SPACE VEHICLES AND HABITATS. THE VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) TOOL WILL REPRESENT A PHYSICS BASED SIMULATION OF THE MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. THE VISUAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE USER CAN BE RAPIDLY SWITCHED TO SIMULATE THAT OF A PERSON IN MICROGRAVITY. A MAJOR COMPONENT OF VEHICLE DESIGN IS OPTIMIZING STORAGE AND USABLE SPACE. BY SIMULATING HOW THE OBJECTS THE USER WILL INTERACT WITH IN MICROGRAVITY  DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED EARLIER IN THE DESIGN PROCESS. SPECIFIC AIM 2: EVALUATE TOOL EFFECTIVENESS IN A VEHICLE MOCK-UP EXPERIMENT. THE INTERACTIVE VR DESIGN TOOL DEVELOPED IN SPECIFIC AIM 1 WILL BE EVALUATED IN COMPARISON TO A MID-FIDELITY PHYSICAL SPACE VEHICLE MOCK-UP. SUBJECTS WILL PERFORM SEQUENTIAL TASKS SIMULATING A SCIENCE PROTOCOL TO BE PERFORMED IN A MICROGRAVITY VEHICLE. ENVIRONMENT ORDER (VR OR PHYSICAL) WILL BE COUNTERBALANCED AND ALL SUBJECTS WILL BE TRAINED ON THE SIMULATED SCIENCE TASKS IN BOTH ENVIRONMENTS PRIOR TO THE START OF THE EXPERIMENT TO REDUCE THE EFFECT OF LEARNING. SUBJECTS WILL BE GIVEN A CHECKLIST TO FOLLOW TO ENSURE HE OR SHE ADHERES TO THE PROTOCOL. AFTER THE SUBJECT HAS COMPLETED 50% OF THE TASKS  HE OR SHE WILL BE GIVEN THE OPTION TO RECONFIGURE THE WORKSPACE. NO CONSTRAINTS ON THE NATURE OF THE RECONFIGURATION WILL BE GIVEN TO THE PARTICIPANTS  AND TASKS WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY DIVERSE SUCH THAT THERE IS NO A PRIORI OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION FOR ALL TASKS.

THE ORIGINAL WORK FOUND THAT SELFASSEMBLY WAS GREATLY ACCELERATED BY UTILIZING A SIMPLE OPEN-LOOP CONTROL SCHEME OF THE MAGNETIC INTERACTIONS. THIS METHODOLOGY OFFERS ONE SOLUTION TO THE DIFFICULT ENGINEERING CHALLENGE OF DEVELOPING SCALABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE FABRICATION METHODS FOR STRUCTURED NANOMATERIALS WITH PROVEN APPLICATIONS IN OPTOELECTRONICS  ENERGY STORAGE AND HARVESTING  BIOLOGICAL SENSING  3D PRINTING  AND HIGHPERFORMANCE COATINGS. HOWEVER  BECAUSE OF LIMITED SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IN THE EXPERIMENTS  DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE SELFASSEMBLED STRUCTURES WAS IMPOSSIBLE. A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF OUT-OF-EQUILIBRIUM SELF-ASSEMBLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE INSPACE SUITE IS NEEDED BEFORE IT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO DESIGN PROCESSES THAT RAPIDLY PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY NANOMATERIALS. THE PROPOSED WORK HAS TWO MAIN OBJECTIVES. FIRST  WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INSIGHTS DEVELOPED SINCE THE INSPACE EXPERIMENTS FOR OTHER OUT-OF-EQUILIBRIUM ASSEMBLIES TO RE-EVALUATE THE INSPACE DATA IN THE PSI SYSTEM. THIS WILL REVEAL NEW RESULTS THAT THE ORIGINAL INSPACE TEAM WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN. SECOND  WE WILL USE THE INSPACE DATA IN THE PSI SYSTEM TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF NANOPARTICLE SELF-ASSEMBLY IN TIME-VARYING FIELDS AND USE THAT MODEL TO EXTEND THE INVESTIGATION OF TOGGLED MAGNETIC FIELD ASSEMBLY BEYOND THE PARAMETER SPACE EXPLORED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SUITE. THIS WILL AID IN DEVELOPING A PREDICTIVE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR DYNAMIC SELF-ASSEMBLY THAT CAN FACILITATE DESIGN OF RAPID NANOMATERIAL SYNTHESES. THE WORK WILL UTILIZE GPU-ACCELERATED DISCRETE ELEMENT SIMULATIONS OF PARTICLE SELF-ASSEMBLY DRIVEN BY MAGNETIC FIELDS WITH DETAILED MODELS OF THE MAGNETIC AND HYDRODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS AMONG THE PARTICLES. THE PI S  LABORATORY HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED NEW ALGORITHMS FOR MODELING THESE INTERACTIONS THAT HAVE ACCELERATED SIMULATIONS BY ROUGHLY A FACTOR OF 100 TIMES. CONSEQUENTLY  DISCRETE ELEMENT SIMULATIONS OF THE HIERARCHICAL SELF-ASSEMBLIES OBSERVED IN THE INSPACE EXPERIMENTS ARE POSSIBLE. THE VIDEO MICROGRAPHS FROM INSPACE ARE OF LIMITED SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION  THEREFORE  SIMULATIONS CAPABLE OF RESOLVING THE PARTICLE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS ON A LOCAL SCALE WHILE REPLICATING STRUCTURE AND GROWTH KINETICS ON LARGER LENGTH SCALES AND LONGER TIME SCALES PROVIDE ADDITION INSIGHT INTO THE INSPACE DATA. THE ABILITY TO TRANSLATE INSPACE MICROGRAVITY DATA FOR THE MANY-BODIED  DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS AMONG SELF-ASSEMBLING PARTICLES INTO WELL-VALIDATED MODELS FOR THE SAME EXPERIMENTS WILL ENABLE SIMULATIONS TO PREDICT AND THEN DESIGN DYNAMIC SELF-ASSEMBLY PROCESSES TERRESTRIALLY AS WELL AS DURING CONTINUED SPACE OPERATIONS. THE PI S LABORATORY HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED A PREDICTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR OTHER TYPES OF TOGGLED SELF-ASSEMBLY AND IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THEORIES FOR THE INSPACE ASSEMBLY THAT CAN BE USED TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME AND QUANTIFY THE ROBUSTNESS OF DYNAMICAL SELF-ASSEMBLY PROCESSES. INCORPORATION OF MICROGRAVITY DATA INTO THIS THEORY IS ESSENTIAL FOR TESTING ITS PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY. THE PI WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL INSPACE 2 TEAM AS A POST-DOCTORAL SCHOLAR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE BEFORE STARTING AS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT MIT. HE IS FIRST AUTHOR OF THE TWO PUBLISHED PAPERS ON INSPACE EXPERIMENTS AND IS INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROJECT. HE HAS ALSO PUBLISHED SEVERAL PAPERS EXTENDING TOGGLED SELF-ASSEMBLY TO GROUND EXPERIMENTS AND TO SIMULATIONS OF NEW SYSTEMS. ONE MIT GRADUATE STUDENT  ZACHARY SHERMAN  CURRENTLY COMPLETING A PH. D.

NNH16ZDA009C  NASA SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION RESEARCH VIRTUAL INSTITUTE SSERVI  CYCLE THREE 3.  THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR IS DR. THOMAS M. ORLANDO WITH THE GEORGIA TECH RESEARCH CORPORATION GIT.  PROJECT SUMMARY:  RECENT SPACE EXPLORATION MISSIONS HAVE REVEALED VOLATILE DEPOSITS ON SEVERAL SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS  INCLUDING THE MOON  MARS  MERCURY  AND NEAR EARTH ASTEROIDS (NEAS).  MOST OF THESE AIRLESS I.E.  ZERO-ATMOSPHERE OBJECTS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY NASA AS DESTINATIONS FOR FUTURE HUMAN EXPLORATION.  THESE OBJECTS ARE BOMBARDED BY RADIATION (I.E. SOLAR WIND  GALACTIC AND SOLAR COSMIC RAYS) AND THE INTERACTION OF RADIATION WITH THEIR SURFACES CAN ALTER AND EVEN PRODUCE VOLATILES.  MORE IMPORTANTLY  THE CONSTANT RADIATION ASSAULT POSES OBVIOUS  LIFE-THREATENING  AND PROGRAM-LIMITING HEALTH RISKS.  AS A MEMBER OF THE SSERVI  THE REVEALS TEAM WILL EXPLORE THE FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED ASPECTS CORRELATED WITH RADIATION PROCESSING OF NATURAL REGOLITH AND MAN-MADE COMPOSITE MATERIALS.  THE REVEALS TEAM WILL FOCUS ON TWO INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH THEMES  EACH COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE TASKS THAT WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN AN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS APPROACH.THEME 1 INTERACTION OF RADIATION AND MICROMETEORITES WITH SURFACE OF AIRLESS BODIES  THE SOLAR WIND INTERACTION WITH REGOLITH HAS BEEN IMPLICATED AS A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF VOLATILES (I.E. WATER) THAT CAN BE TRAPPED AND SEQUESTERED IN THE NEAR SURFACE REGION OF THE MOON AND POSSIBLY DEMOS  PHOBOS  AND NEAS.  THE RELEVANT PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND DRIVING INTERACTIONS ARE UNCLEAR.  THEREFORE  THEME 1 WILL FOCUS ON THREE TASKS: 1) EXAMINE SOLAR WIND  MICROMETEORITE PROCESSING OF AIRLESS BODY SURFACES AND DUST IRRADIATION SOURCES  2 DEVELOP MOLECULAR MODELS DESCRIBING RADIATION INDUCED TRANSFORMATION OF REGOLITH  3 EXAMINE THE ROLE OF CHARGING AND ELECTRIC FIELDS ON VOLATILE FORMATION/RELEASE AND 4) TEST SOLAR COLLECTION PANELS AS AN IN SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION STRATEGY OF PRODUCING WATER FROM REGOLITHTHEME 2 DEVELOPING AND TESTING NEW MATERIALS FOR IMPROVED SAFETY AND HEALTH DURING HUMAN EXPLORATION HUMAN EXPLORATION MISSIONS BEYOND NEAR EARTH ORBIT CANNOT OCCUR WITHOUT A VALIDATED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ASTRONAUT HEALTH RISKS DUE TO RADIATION.  THIS REQUIRES CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT  EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF RADIATION PROTECTION METHODOLOGIES  AND THE ABILITY TO PREDICT AND MONITOR THE RADIATION ABSORBED BY ASTRONAUTS ON A REAL-TIME AND MISSION-INTEGRATED BASIS. AS OF 2016  THE DEEP-SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT IS REASONABLY CHARACTERIZED  BUT RADIATION PROTECTION MATERIALS FOR HUMAN HABITATS AND SPACE-SUITS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED AND CHARACTERIZED  AND REAL-TIME RADIATION MONITORS ARE IN THEIR INFANCY.  FOR EXAMPLE  REAL-TIME AREA RADIATION MONITORS ARE CURRENTLY UTILIZED ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WITH INCONSISTENT RESULTS  AND THEY ARE NOT INTEGRATED WITH SPACE-SUITS.  DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG  FLEXIBLE AND RADIATION PROTECTIVE MATERIAL IS ALSO LAGGING.  THEREFORE  THEME 2 WILL FOCUS ON ASSESSING AND MITIGATING HUMAN RADIATION RISKS BY 1 TESTING REGOLITH AS A POTENTIAL SHIELDING MATERIAL  2) DEVELOPING  CHARACTERIZING AND TESTING NOVEL COMPOSITE MATERIALS FOR SUPERIOR MECHANICAL  THERMAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES  3 INTEGRATING THE BEST POLYMER COMPOSITES AS MODIFICATION TO EXISTING SPACE-SUITS  AND 4 DEVELOPING REAL-TIME LOW WEIGHT AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION RADIATION MONITORING DEVICES USING GRAPHENE AND OTHER 2D MATERIALS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f7c481d7-071a-ead9-3bda-e4e7d1e903a7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80ARC017M0007_8000"}, {"internal_id": 46416779, "Award ID": "80ARC017M0006", "Award Amount": 5071537.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2017-08-16", "CFDA Number": "43.009", "Description": "MULTIPLE YEAR AWARD WITH INCREMENTAL FUNDING FOR YEARS ONE TO FIVE.

PROJECT SUMMARY:  NESS WILL IMPLEMENT CROSS-DISCIPLINARY PARTNERSHIPS TO ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY AND HUMAN EXPLORATION OF TARGET DESTINATIONS  AND WILL CONDUCT RESEARCH IN ASTROPHYSICS AND HELIOPHYSICS THAT IS UNIQUELY ENABLED BY HUMAN AND ROBOTIC EXPLORATION OF TARGET BODIES.   OUR RESEARCH IS DERIVED FROM THREE DECADAL SURVEYS AND FROM THE NASA ASTROPHYSICS AND GLOBAL EXPLORATION ROADMAPS.  NESS RESEARCH INCLUDES: TELEROBOTIC OPERATION OF SURFACE SCIENCE  EXPLORATION ASSETS AT THE MOON AND MARS  THE NATURE OF THE MOON'S CORE  AN IMPROVED SELENODETIC COORDINATE SYSTEM PRECISION TESTS OF GRAVITATION  ENERGETIC SOLAR PARTICLE EVENTS IN INTERPLANETARY SPACE AND EXTRASOLAR SYSTEMS  DUST ENVIRONMENTS OF SPACE AND TARGET BODIES  DETECTION OF THE UNIVERSE'S FIRST GALAXIES  AND HABITABLE EXOPLANETS.  FOUR KEY PROJECTS WILL BE PROPOSED.    EXPLORATION SCIENCE  NESS WILL MATURE A CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY OF SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION MISSIONS FROM THE ORBITS OF TARGET BODIES:  SURFACE TELEROBOTICS.  WE WILL DEVELOP HUMAN-ROBOTIC SCIENCE ASSOCIATED WITH ORION/HABITAT MISSIONS IN CIS-LUNAR ORBITS.  OUR TEAM WILL BUILD TOOLS FOR THE CREW TO TELEOPERATE ROVERS ON THE LUNAR FARSIDE THAT WILL FEED-FORWARD TO THE FIRST CREWED MARS MISSIONS.  WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE SYSTEMS NEEDED ON ORION/HABITAT TO SUPPORT TELEROBOTICS  ANALYZE LUNAR LOW FREQUENCY RADIO TELESCOPE DEPLOYMENT ALONG WITH A LUNAR SAMPLE RETURN  AND DEVELOP CREW TRAINING STRATEGIES.  LLR  CURRENT ALTERNATE THEORIES OF GRAVITY PREDICT DEVIATIONS FROM GENERAL RELATIVITY  GR  AT A LEVEL THAT IS WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF LUNAR LASER RANGING  LLR  INSTRUMENTS.  NESS WILL IMPROVE BY FACTORS GREATER THAN 100 THE SIGNAL PHOTOELECTRON ACCURACY OF LLR TO SET NEW CONSTRAINTS ON GR AND THE LUNAR CORE.  WE WILL ALSO MEASURE/MODEL DUST ON LLR OPTICAL SURFACES AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SELENODETIC COORDINATE SYSTEM FOR EXPLORATION AND SCIENCE MISSIONS.  HELIOPHYSICS AND SPACE PHYSICS_NESS HELIOPHYSICS RESEARCH DIRECTLY IMPACTS HUMAN EXPLORATION VIA OUR STUDIES OF SOLAR PARTICLE RADIATION AND INTERPLANETARY DUST.  WE WILL ADVANCE THE DESIGN FOR A LUNAR-BASED LOW FREQUENCY  LESS THAN 10 MHZ  RADIO IMAGER  UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF IMAGING THE TRAJECTORY OF PARTICLE ACCELERATION IN SOLAR ERUPTIONS  AND MEASURING INTERPLANETARY NANODUST.  FROM COSMIC DAWN TO HABITABLE PLANETS  NESS ADDRESSES KEY QUESTIONS FROM THE ASTROPHYSICS DECADAL SURVEY: \"WHEN AND HOW DID THE FIRST GALAXIES FORM?\" AND \"CAN WE FIND ANOTHER PLANET LIKE EARTH ORBITING A NEARBY STAR?\" OUR TEAM WILL USE NEW MODELING TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO INVESTIGATE THE FORMATION OF THE FIRST GALAXIES USING THE NEUTRAL HYDROGEN 21-CM SIGNAL  RED-SHIFTED TO 2-3 M.  THE MOON'S FARSIDE IS UNIQUELY SHIELDED FROM RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE AND FREE FROM IONOSPHERIC EFFECTS TO ENABLE SUCH OBSERVATIONS.  A FARSIDE OBSERVATORY IS IMPORTANT FOR EXPLORATION TO INVESTIGATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES TO DEPLOYING/OPERATING A LARGE-AREA SCIENTIFIC STATION ON THE MOON.  WE WILL ADVANCE 21-CM COSMOLOGY THEORY  THE DESIGN OF A LOW RADIO FREQUENCY ARRAY  WIDE-BAND RECEIVERS  AND NEW CALIBRATION TECHNIQUES.  NESS ALSO WILL ADVANCE THE STUDY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HABITABLE EXOPLANETS BY EMPLOYING POLARIMETRY ON LARGE UV_OPTICAL TELESCOPES CONSTRUCTED IN CIS-LUNAR SPACE  AND BY USING A FARSIDE RADIO ARRAY TO DETECT MAGNETOSPHERES FOR EARTH-LIKE PLANETS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7d586cfa-95f6-0e31-3589-fbd59b788eda-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80ARC017M0006_8000"}, {"internal_id": 46416778, "Award ID": "80ARC017M0005", "Award Amount": 5485341.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2017-08-17", "CFDA Number": "43.001", "Description": "MULTIPLE YEAR AWARD WITH INCREMENTAL FUNDING FOR YEARS ONE TO FIVE.

PROJECT SUMMARY:  THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE TREX TEAM IS DEVELOP TOOLS AND RESEARCH METHODS FOR EXPLORATION OF AIRLESS SURFACES THAT ARE COATED IN FINE-GRAINED DUST TO PREPARE FOR HUMAN MISSIONS.  OUR TEAM WILL USING LABORATORY SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS AND EXPERIMENTS  ACCOMPANIED BY STUDIES OF EXISTING DATA FROM THE MOON AND SMALL BODIES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS AND TO INVESTIGATE IN SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION (ISRU) POTENTIAL ON SMALL-BODY TARGETS.  ADDITIONALLY  OUR TEAM WILL DEVELOP INSTRUMENTATION (ESPECIALLY ULTRA-VIOLET_UV_VISIBLE CAPABILITIES) AND SOFTWARE FOR FUTURE USE AT THOSE BODIES (EITHER REMOTELY AND/OR WITH HUMANS).  THESE TOOLS WILL IMPROVE MISSION SUCCESS BY DECREASING RISK AND ASSURING THE SAFETY OF ASTRONAUTS AND SPACECRAFT.  THE TREX TASKS COMPLEMENT THOSE OF CURRENT SSERVI TEAMS BY EMPHASIZING ANALYSES OF THE FINEST FRACTION OF GRAINS AND UV WAVELENGTHS.  TREX HAS 4 THEMES THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE LIFE TIME OF THE AWARD.  THEY ARE: 1) DEVELOPMENT OF NON-AMBIENT (VACUUM  MULTI-TEMPERATURE) BROAD WAVELENGTH SPECTRAL DATABASE OF PLANETARY MATERIALS.  WE WILL UTILIZE A RANGE OF FACILITIES TO MAKE THE SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS  WITH UNIQUE AND OVERLAPPING CAPABILITIES IN ORDER TO DERIVE A ROBUST SET OF CROSS-CALIBRATED LAB DATA.  2) INVESTIGATIONS OF FINE-GRAINED MATERIALS ON THE LUNAR SURFACE.  LAB DATA FROM THEME ONE WILL BE USED ALONG WITH SPACECRAFT DATA OF THE MOON AND MODELING TECHNIQUES  TO CHARACTERIZE LUNAR GRAIN SIZE  MINERALOGY AND CORRELATIONS WITH GEOLOGIC FEATURES  WITH AN OVERALL GOAL OF INVESTIGATION ISRU POTENTIAL AND FUTURE INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT NEEDS.  3) INVESTIGATIONS OF FINE GRAINED MATERIALS ON THE SURFACES OF SMALL BODIES.  NEAR EARTH OBJECTS (NEO)  AND THE MARTIAN MOONS ARE POTENTIAL FUTURE HUMAN DESTINATIONS AND EVOKE A NUMBER OF CRITICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR COMPOSITIONS AND DYNAMICAL HISTORIES.  AND 4) DECISION-MAKING IN A FINE-GRAINED ANALOG ENVIRONMENT.  WE WILL DEVELOP BOTH SOFTWARE AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR SUE IN THE FIELD AS A TESTING GROUND FOR FUTURE ROBOTIC PLANETARY USES.   THE TASKS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE TREX TEAM WILL ENABLE NASA' EXPLORATION OF THE MOON  NEO  AND THE MOONS OF THE MARS BY ACQUIRING THE INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL SERVE AS TOOLS FOR FUTURE HUMAN AND ROBOTIC EXPLORATION.
