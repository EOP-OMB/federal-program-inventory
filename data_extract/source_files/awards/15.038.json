THE DESIGNATED TRIBAL LEAD FOR THE PROJECT IS ANDREA GUSTY, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE KUSKOKWIM CORPORATION. UPPER KALSKAG IS LOCATED ON THE NORTH BANK OF THE KUSKOKWIM RIVER, 2 MILES UPRIVER FROM LOWER KALSKAG. UPPER KALSKAG AND LOWER KALSKAG ARE SERVICED BY A SINGLE POWER PLANT THAT IS OWNED BY THE ALASKA VILLAGE ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC. (AVEC).

AVEC GENERATES APPROXIMATELY 843,000 KWH PER YEAR FOR UPPER KALSKAG AND 661,000 KWH PER YEAR FOR LOWER KALSKAG FOR A TOTAL OF NEARLY 1.6 MILLION KWH PER YEAR.

MINERAL PROPERTIES CONTROLLED BY CIRI INCLUDE THE RED MOUNTAIN CHROME DEPOSIT NEAR SELDOVIA, THE JOHNSON RIVER GOLD-ZINC PROSPECT ON THE WEST SIDE OF COOK INLET, AND THE FAREWELL BASE METAL DISTRICT SOUTHEAST OF MCGRATH. ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING OF THESE PROPERTIES IS FAREWELL, A PROPERTY ABOUT 160 MILES NORTHWEST OF ANCHORAGE WHERE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. FAREWELL IS A VERY LARGE AREA ENCOMPASSING MANY PROSPECTS. BASED ON PHASE 1, IT WAS VERIFIED THAT ABUNDANT ZINC-COPPER-SILVER SKARN AND MANTO MINERALIZATION IN THE FAREWELL TRACT INDICATES A LARGE VOLUME OF MINERALIZED, HYDROTHERMAL FLUID HAS MOVED THROUGH THE UNDERLYING ROCKS.  THE SOURCE OR SOURCES FOR MINERALIZING FLUIDS HAVE YET TO BE DISCOVERED. THE SKARNS AND MANTOS ARE RECOGNIZED AS POSSIBLE INDICATORS OF A BURIED PORPHYRY DEPOSIT. PHASE 2 WILL FOCUS ON THE 6120 AND MIDWAY TARGETS, AS THESE WERE SHOWN TO BE THE MOST PROSPECTIVE FOR COPPER PORPHYRIES.

THE TRIBES DESIRE TO REDUCE THIS RISK BEFORE INVESTING IN THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. INDUSTRY EXPERTS ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUREST PLACE TO LOOK FOR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES IS WHERE THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCOVERED.

BY INTEGRATING STATE OF THE ART GEOPHYSICAL RE-PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS JOINED WITH GEOLOGIC, PETROPHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING ANALYSIS, THE TRIBES CAN OBTAIN A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF PETROLEUM RESERVOIR STRUCTURE, BEHAVIOR AND DRAINAGE. THIS WILL ENABLE THE TRIBES TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC HIGH CONFIDENCE INFILL OR STRUCTURAL OPPORTUNITIES REMAINING IN A GIVEN FIELD. THE TRIBES INITIATED THIS PROCESS IN 2019 BY COMMISSIONING A STUDY USING A DEMD GRANT IN THE LUSTRE AND BENRUD FIELDS. THE STUDY IDENTIFIED MULTIPLE LOW RISK DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE LUSTRE FIELD WITH A NET PRESENT VALUE IN EXCESS OF 168 MILLION DOLLARS AT CURRENT PRICES.
