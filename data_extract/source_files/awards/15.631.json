THE CONVERSION OCCURRED AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF 500,000 ACRES OF GRASS PER YEAR, 2015 TO 2020 (USDA, NASS, WWF PLOWPRINT 2022 REPORT). WITHIN THE ECOREGION, CONVERSION CONTINUES TO OCCUR DUE TO HIGH CROP PRICES, GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES AND A GROWING GLOBAL HUMAN POPULATION. THIS LEADS TO LOSS OF HABITAT AND THREATENS THE ABILITY OF THE LAND TO PROVIDE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, SUCH AS CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND STORAGE, BIODIVERSITY, WATER FILTRATION AND REDUCED EROSION. GRASS-BASED ECONOMIES ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF COMBATING GRASSLANDS CONVERSION BY MAINTAINING INTACT GRASSLANDS AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE. MUCH OF THE INTACT GRASSLANDS IN THE NGP, AND THE ASSOCIATED LIVELIHOODS OF ITS OWNERS AND OPERATORS, ARE SUPPORTED THROUGH RANCHING. SUSTAINABLE GRAZING MANAGEMENT FACILITATES THE COEXISTENCE OF LIVESTOCK WITH NATIVE WILDLIFE, PROMOTES VEGETATION PRODUCTIVITY, ENSURES HEALTHY ROOT AND MICROBIAL SYSTEMS, AND PROTECTS SOIL FROM EROSION. RANCHERS USE GRAZING MANAGEMENT PLANS TO MANAGE GRASSLANDS WHILE ALSO MANAGING EMISSIONS, PROMOTING CARBON SEQUESTRATION, AND IMPROVING SOIL HEALTH AND WATER INFILTRATION.

THE ENTIRE AREA IS NOW BURNED AND DEVOID OF GROUND VEGETATION, DECIMATING THE PREVIOUSLY HEALTHY AND INTACT ECOSYSTEM. BECAUSE THIS CREEK FLOWS INTO THE NORTH FORK SPRAGUE, IT IS A PRIORITY TO REDUCE POTENTIAL NUTRIENT LOADING BY CAPTURING OR PREVENTING SEDIMENT RUNOFF FROM THE FIRE. THE PROPOSED PROJECTS ARE A CONTINUATION OF RESTORATION WORK STARTED IN 2022, WHICH INCLUDED HAZARD TREE REMOVAL, REMOVAL OF BURNED FENCING, AND INSTALLATION OF NEW PERIMETER FENCE TO KEEP CATTLE OFF THE NORTHERN SITE AND PROTECT THE SENSITIVE RIPARIAN SPRING HABITATS. CURRENTLY THERE IS LIMITED INSTREAM COMPLEXITY COVERAGE, AND THE STREAM HAS FAIRLY UNIFORM DEPTH AND FLOW, WHICH LIMITS THE CAPACITY FOR FISH ABUNDANCE. INSTREAM STRUCTURES WILL PROVIDE FISH HABITAT COVER AND REDUCE WATER TEMPERATURES. RIPARIAN AND UPLAND PLANTINGS WILL STABILIZE THE SOILS TO CAPTURE OR PREVENT FURTHER EROSION, AND PROVIDE OVERBANK COVER (SHADE). THE PROPOSED INSTREAM STRUCTURES WOULD SUPPORT REARING, RESTING, AND FEEDING (ESSENTIALLY ALL LIVE STAGES OF REDBAND TROUT). ADDING WOODY STRUCTURES WITHIN THE STREAM WILL ALSO DECREASE THE VOLUME OF DISCHARGE NEEDED TO FORCE OVERBANK FLOW, WHICH WILL THEREFORE INCREASE THE FREQUENCY THAT HIGH-FLOW CHANNELS WILL BE CONNECTED AND SEASONAL WETLANDS WILL BE INUNDATED. BEAVER ACTIVITY POST-FIRE IS ALREADY PRESENT WITHIN THE SITES AND PROPOSED RIPARIAN PLANTINGS WOULD ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT BEAVER ESTABLISHMENT. A LOW-TECH PROCESS BASED RESTORATION DESIGN MODEL WAS COMPLETED BY ANABRANCH SOLUTIONS AND WILL BE USED AS A GUIDE FOR OBJECTIVES OF INSTREAM HABITAT WORK. THE PLAN IS A PHASED APPROACH WITH MONITORING AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF STRUCTURES OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD. MID AND LOWER REACHES OF FIVEMILE CREEK OUTSIDE THE BURNED AREA (ON FOREST SERVICE LAND NEAR FOSTER FIELD) WILL BE ALSO USED AS A REFERENCE SITE TO DRIVE RESTORATION GOALS. HAZARD TREES NEAR THE STREAM WILL BE FELLED BEFORE LOW-TECH RESTORATION BEGINS. SITE SELECTION, DESIGN, AND ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF INSTALLATION OR AUGMENTATION OF BEAVER DAM ANALOGS AND POST-ASSISTED LOG STRUCTURES WILL BE DEVELOPED USING THE BEAVER RESTORATION GUIDEBOOK 2.01 (POLLOCK ET AL. 2018) AND LOW-TECH PROCESS-BASED RESTORATION OF RIVERSCAPES  DESIGN MANUAL VERSION 1.0 (WHEATON ET AL. 2019). TO JUMPSTART REGROWTH IN THE RIPARIAN WETLAND AREAS WE WILL BE PLANTING NATIVE TREES AND SHRUBS SUCH AS WILLOW, ALDER, COTTONWOOD, SNOWBERRY, CURRANT, DOGWOOD, ETC. THE GRASSES, SAGES, AND RUSHES APPEAR TO BE REESTABLISHING. A PORTION OF THE PLANTS WILL BE PROTECTED WITH CAGES TO DETER BEAVER UNTIL THERE IS ENOUGH REGROWTH. ALL PLANTINGS (INCLUDING FUTURE UPLAND FOREST) WILL BE PHASED OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD. IN SUMMARY, THE FISCAL YEAR 2023 FUNDING WILL BE USED FOR THE REMOVAL UTILIZATION OF BURNED TREES WITHIN THE RIPARIAN, PHASED LOW-TECH PROCESS-BASED RESTORATION INSTREAM HABITAT WORK, AND RIPARIAN PLANTINGS.

SOUTHWEST FLANK OF MAUNA LOA VOLCANO ON THE ISLAND OF HAWAII. THE PRESERVE FORMS A CORE PIECE OF CRITICALLY IMPORTANT CONSERVATION AREAS THAT INCLUDE PRIVATE LANDS, STATE NATURAL AREA RESERVES, AND HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY HAS MANAGED THE AREA SINCE 2000 WITH EMPHASIS ON FENCING, REMOVING FERAL HOOFED ANIMALS, CONTROLLING INVASIVE PLANT POPULATIONS, AND MANAGING THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE. TODAY, THE PRESERVE IS THE LARGEST CONTIGUOUS AREA OF PRIORITY WATERSHED NATIVE FOREST IN THE SOUTH KONA REGION THAT IS FREE OF THE THREAT OF FERAL HOOFED ANIMALS. THIS PROJECT WILL ENSURE THE CONTINUED PROTECTION OF 8,073 ACRES OF NATIVE UPLAND FOREST BY REPLACING 17.5 MILES OF PERIMETER FENCING AT KONA HEMA PRESERVE. THIS WORK INVOLVES BRUSH REMOVAL ALONG THE EXISTING FENCE LINE FOLLOWED BY REMOVAL, DISPOSAL AND REPLACEMENT OF WOVEN WIRE FENCE BY STAFF, CONTRACTORS, INTERNS AND VOLUNTEERS. EACH 330-FOOT SECTION OF WOVEN WIRE WILL BE REMOVED FROM EXISTING FENCE POSTS AND NEW WIRE WILL BE INSTALLED ON THE SAME DAY TO ENSURE THAT NONNATIVE ANIMALS INCLUDING PIGS, GOATS AND SHEEP DO NOT ENTER THE PRESERVE. PROJECT FUNDING WILL SUPPORT LOCAL FENCE CONTRACTORS, A NEW FULL-TIME FIELD TECHNICIAN POSITION AT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND ADDITIONAL INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. IT IS EXPECTED THAT REPLACEMENT OF THE FULL 17.5 MILES OF PERIMETER FENCE WILL TAKE BETWEEN TWO-TO-FIVE YEARS TO COMPLETE AT A TOTAL COST OF  924,000.

PROJECTS MAY INCLUDE: REBUILDING AND CONSTRUCTING LEVEES AND WATER CONTROL STRUCTURES TO RESTORE WET MEADOW HYDROLOGY, RETAINING FLOOD IRRIGATION TRADITION TO MAINTAIN WATERBIRD HABITAT AND RECHARGE GROUNDWATER, FIELD LEVELING TO INCREASE IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY, INSTALLATION OF WATER CONTROL STRUCTURES, IMPROVEMENT OF DRAINS, INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL OF FENCING IN ASSOCIATION WITH LEVEE IMPROVEMENTS, ALTERING AGRICULTURE PRACTICES TO LEAVE UNHARVESTED GRAIN FOR WILDLIFE FOOD; AND SO FORTH. THESE PROJECTS WILL BENEFIT NUMEROUS SPECIES OF WILDLIFE INCLUDING DEER, ELK, TROUT, WATERFOWL, AND OTHER FEDERAL TRUST SPECIES. IN PARTICULAR, WITH BOTH TULE LAKE AND LOWER KLAMATH NWRS BEING COMPLETELY DRY DUE TO DROUGHT, THESE 2 PROJECT LOCATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE WATERFOWL HABITAT.1) LOWLAND FARMS WET MEADOW:THIS PROJECT WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND ON THE WATERFOWL HABITAT AT THIS LOCATION. FLOOD IRRIGATION IS STRONGLY LINKED TO WATERFOWL POPULATIONS IN THE BASIN, THIS 107 ACRE WET MEADOW IS AN IMPORTANT AREA THAT IS RETAINING ITS' FLOOD IRRIGATION TRADITION. HOWEVER, DILAPIDATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND AN INCOMPLETE LEVEE REDUCES THE AVAILABILITY OF WATERFOWL HABITAT AND IMPAIRS WET MEADOW HAY PRODUCTION. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP TO REBUILD SEVERAL DILAPIDATED LEVEES AND WATER CONTROL STRUCTURES AND WILL PROVIDE FLOODED WET MEADOW HABITAT DURING SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER, A TIME WHERE FORAGING RESOURCES FOR WATERBIRDS ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED. OLD FENCING WILL BE REMOVED AND NEW FENCING INSTALLED TO PREVENT ACCESS BY COWS.1) IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY PROJECT ON KLAMATH DRAINAGE DISTRICT:IN RESPONSE TO THE DROUGHT MANY AGENCIES HAVE PROMOTED THE IDEA OF IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY, WHICH GENERALLY TRANSLATES TO WHEEL LINES AND CENTER PIVOT SPRINKLER SYSTEMS. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY OFTEN AMPLIFIES THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT BY REDUCING GROUND WATER RECHARGE, RESULTING IN GROUND WATER DECLINES. LASER LEVELING IS AN ALTERNATIVE WATER EFFICIENCY TECHNIQUE WHICH REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF WATER NEEDED FOR FLOOD IRRIGATION WHILE MAINTAINING WATERBIRD AND GROUNDWATER RECHARGE BENEFITS. LASER LEVELING USES PRECISE SURVEY TECHNOLOGY TO MOVE SOIL FROM HIGH AREAS OF A FIELD TO LOW AREAS, CREATING A GENTLE EVEN SLOPE ACROSS A FIELD. THIS PROCESS WAS USED ON AREA K IN LOWER KLAMATH NWR, AN AREA CO-MANAGED BY THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION AND THE FWS. LASER LEVELING ON LOWER KLAMATH OFTEN REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF WATER NEEDED TO FLOOD A FIELD BY 33% OR MORE. WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE LASER LEVELING TECHNIQUES ON A 196 ACRE FIELD IN KDD FOR THE PURPOSES OF WATER EFFICIENCY. FOR OUR PROPOSAL, THE LANDOWNER WOULD LEAVE A 1/4 OF HIS GRAIN FIELD UN-HARVESTED FOR 4 YEARS AS AN IN-KIND MATCH, AND MAY ASSIST WITH EARTHWORK ACTIVITIES AS NEEDED. INCORPORATING UN-HARVESTED GRAIN LEAVE WOULD INCREASE THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF THIS FIELD BY NEARLY 10 FOLD. THIS PROPOSAL SUPPORTS MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES: 1) REDUCING THE WATER BUDGET, 2) INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF WATERFOWL SUPPORTED ON THE LANDSCAPE FOR A 4-YEAR PERIOD, 3) INCREASED GROUND WATER RECHARGE, AND
