A SIMILAR STRATEGY TO PHASE I WILL BE IMPLEMENTED, CENTERED AROUND EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTING PROTOCOL P29, THROUGH THE FOLLOWING FIVE INTERMEDIATE OBJECTIVES (IOS):\n1) IO1: INCREASED KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ILO PROTOCOL AND RECOMMENDATION;\n2) IO2: IMPROVED AND RESPONSIVE NATIONAL POLICIES, ACTION PLANS AND LEGISLATION ON FORCED LABOR WITH STRONG ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS;\n3) IO3: INCREASED EFFORTS TO COLLECT RELIABLE NATIONAL STATISTICS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE ACROSS INSTITUTIONS AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND GLOBAL LEVELS;\n4) IO4: WORKERS' AND EMPLOYERS' ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR; AND\n5) IO5: STRENGTHENED AWARENESS AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS OF FORCED LABOR.\nPHASE II OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL ALSO AIM TO MAINSTREAM THE 'ACCELERATION FACTORS' WHICH ARE THE CORE PILLARS OF THE ILO 8.7 ACCELERATOR LAB INITIATIVE5. THIS INITIATIVE WAS CREATED TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE ERADICATION OF FORCED LABOR AND THE ELIMINATION OF CHILD LABOR BY OPTIMIZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION INTERVENTIONS BY EMBRACING SIX ACCELERATION FACTORS. THESE ACCELERATION FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT CAN EFFECT CHANGE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN A SHIFTING ENVIRONMENT, HELPING ADDRESS GAPS IN PROGRAMMING, WHILST COMBINING BOTH FORWARD-LOOKING INNOVATION AND SCALING OF EFFECTIVE PRACTICES.\n\nDELIVERABLES\nSINCE 2015, THE ILO HAS SUPPORTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STRATEGY THROUGH THE USDOL-FUNDED PROJECT \"FROM PROTOCOL TO PRACTICE: A BRIDGE TO GLOBAL ACTION ON FORCED LABOR (THE BRIDGE PROJECT)\". THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASING GLOBAL EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE FORCED LABOR BY IMPROVING COUNTRIES' CAPACITY TO TACKLE THE ISSUE. THE PROJECT WORKED GLOBALLY AND IN SIX PILOT COUNTRIES - MALAYSIA, MAURITANIA, NEPAL, NIGER, PERU AND UZBEKISTAN - TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNMENTS, EMPLOYERS' AND WORKERS' ORGANIZATIONS, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS. THE PROJECT'S FOCUS WAS TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS AND RATIFICATIONS OF THE ILO PROTOCOL; IMPROVE AND DEVELOP RESPONSIVE NATIONAL POLICIES, ACTIONS AND LEGISLATION ON FORCED LABOR; UNDERTAKE RESEARCH AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE ON FORCED LABOR; STRENGTHEN WORKERS' AND EMPLOYERS' ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR, AND INCREASE THE AWARENESS OF AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS OF FORCED LABOR.\n\nINTENDED BENEFICIARY\nTHE SECOND PHASE OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL ENABLE THE ILO TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE FIRST PHASE6, WHILE ALSO TARGETING NEW SECTORS, COUNTRIES, AND VULNERABLE GROUPS. PHASE II WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AT GLOBAL LEVEL, REGIONAL LEVEL AND IN 5 PRIORITY COUNTRIES.\n\nTHE REGIONAL COMPONENT WILL COVER SELECTED PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES (MARSHALL ISLANDS, PALAU, TONGA, TUVALU AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA), WITH A FOCUS ON PROMOTING THE RATIFICATION OF PROTOCOL 29 AND CONVENTION 29, AS 4 OUT OF THE 7 COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT RATIFIED CONVENTION 29 ARE IN THE PACIFIC. THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, PALAU, TONGA, AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA ALSO APPEAR ON THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS TIER 2 WATCH LIST, FOR THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE IDENTIFICATION OF VICTIMS, AND INSUFFICIENT PROSECUTION AND CONVICTIONS OF TRAFFICKING CASES, INCLUDING THE CASE OF MIGRANT WORKERS TRAFFICKED FOR LABOR EXPLOITATION.\n\nTHE PROJECT'S FIVE PRIORITY COUNTRIES WILL INCLUDE THREE FROM PHASE I - NEPAL, PERU AND UZBEKISTAN - WHERE THE PROJECT WILL SCALE UP KEY INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL POTENTIALLY HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THESE COUNTRIES' CAPACITY TO SUSTAINABLY ADDRESS FORCED LABOR. THESE INCLUDE THE RATIFICATION OF THE PROTOCOL AND THE ADOPTION OF A NEW FORCED LABOR LAW THAT WILL PROTECT ALL BONDED LABORERS IN NEPAL; AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL POLICY ON FORCED LABOR AND THE PROVISION OF LIVELIHOOD SERVICES TO VICTIMS IN PERU. UZBEKISTAN WAS ADDED AS A BRIDGE PHASE I COUNTRY IN 2021, WITH ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON ADVOCACY, AWARENESS RAISING AND CAPACITY BUILDING OF LABOR INSPECTORS (IO1 AND IO2). FOLLOWING THE CLOSURE OF THE THIRD PARTY MONITORING PROJECT IN 2022, THERE IS NOW THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT ON SAFEGUARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE IN THE COTTON SECTOR, BY ENSURING A MAINTAINABLE TRANSITION TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE APPROACH, THAT GOES BEYOND THE MONITORING/MEASUREMENT, BASED ON THE REINFORCEMENT OF LABOR INSPECTION (I.E. THE LABOR ADMINISTRATION INSTITUTION THAT, ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS, HAS THE MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT LABOR RIGHTS ARE A REALITY AT THE WORKPLACES) AND, THEREFORE, MORE LIKELY TO ENSURE AND ADVANCE THE PROMOTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL PROVISIONS ON FORCED LABOR IN THIS AND OTHER SECTORS (SUCH AS SERICULTURE/SILK). TO THIS END, THE PROJECT WILL FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OF LABOR INSPECTION AND THE CAPACITY OF LABOR INSPECTORS, AND WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE ALIGNMENT OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICES ON LABOR INSPECTION WITH THE RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE ILO LABOR INSPECTION CONVENTION, 1947 (NO. 81) AND ILO LABOR INSPECTION (AGRICULTURE) CONVENTION, 1969 (NO. 129).\n\nUNDER PHASE I, PERU AND NEPAL BECAME ALLIANCE 8.7 PATHFINDER COUNTRIES, WHILE UZBEKISTAN BECAME A PARTNER COUNTRY AND IS CONSIDERING BECOMING A PATHFINDER COUNTRY. THE PROJECT'S INTERVENTIONS IN ALL THREE COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR PRIORITIES TO ACHIEVE SDG TARGET 8.7, IN LINE WITH THE PROJECT'S STRATEGY.\nTHE TWO NEW COUNTRIES THE ILO PROPOSES TO INCLUDE UNDER PHASE II ARE PAKISTAN AND MONGOLIA. NEITHER COUNTRY HAS RATIFIED PROTOCOL 29, AND BOTH HAVE REPEATEDLY REQUESTED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE ILO IN THE AREA OF FORCED LABOR. BOTH HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO COMMENTS OR OBSERVATIONS BY THE COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS ON THE APPLICATION OF CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (CEACR) UNDER CONVENTION NO. 29 DURING THE PERIOD 2019-2020.\n\nSUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES\nN/A", "Place of Performance Country Code": "NPL", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "adc29447-cc41-c860-247f-9b0e696a9df1-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_IL394602275K_1605"}, {"internal_id": 155517572, "Award ID": "IL394492275K", "Award Amount": 3000000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-12-15", "CFDA Number": "17.401", "Description": "AWARD PURPOSE\nTHE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS TO INCREASE USE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL MECHANISMS BY FIELD WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE DOMINICAN SUGAR SECTOR TO IMPROVE THEIR WORKING AND LIVING CONDITIONS.

WHILE THERE IS NOT A CATALYZING CATASTROPHIC EVENT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE LABOR CONDITIONS IN TEA, SHRIMP FARMING AND CONSTRUCTION SECTORS AS THERE WAS IN THE RMG SECTOR, THE SLOW ONSET EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT EXACERBATE EXISTING OSH CONCERNS SHOULD RAISE SIMILAR ALARM. THEREFORE, THE PROGRAM WILL ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ON WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE DESIGN ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THOUGH INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND FIRES ARE THE MOST VISIBLE OSH HAZARDS, LESS WIDELY DISCUSSED INDUSTRIAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN HAVE LONG-TERM NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON WORKERS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. COMMON OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES IN THE FOUR TARGET SECTORS INCLUDE MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS, PESTICIDE POISONING, HEAT EXHAUSTION, RESPIRATORY ILLNESS, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUES, AND CANCER. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THESE SAFETY AND HEALTH CONCERNS HOLISTICALLY.  THE SC WILL UTILIZE A WHOLE-OF-COMMUNITY APPROACH (AS EFFECTIVELY PILOTED BY THE SC IN THE RMG, SHRIMP AND FISH PROCESSING, AND LEATHER TANNERIES SECTORS) TO ENGAGE WORKERS, THEIR UNIONS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN JOINT INITIATIVES FOR IMPROVING WORKING AND LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE SELECTED AREAS. THIS WILL INCLUDE COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS, TAILORED TO EACH SECTOR, WHERE PROJECT PARTICIPANTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING, SEEK LEGAL COUNSEL OR HEALTH SERVICES, AND HOLD ORGANIZING AND ADVOCACY MEETINGS TO ADVANCE THEIR SHARED GOALS. THE APPROACH RECOGNIZES THAT WORKERS' LIVES EXTEND BEYOND THE FACTORY OR FARM GATE AND THAT WORKPLACE AND PUBLIC HEALTH OVERLAP IN TANGIBLE WAYS.\n\n\nACTIVITIES PERFORMED\nDURING THE THREE-TO-SIX-MONTH START-UP PERIOD, THE SC AND PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS WILL CONDUCT INITIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN EACH SECTOR (FOUR TOTAL) THAT WILL INCLUDE THE LEADERSHIP OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, WORKER-LEADERS FROM THE TARGET SECTORS, RELEVANT SC STAFF, AND THE PROJECT DIRECTOR. DUE TO THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA SECTORS, THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL REQUIRE 3 DAYS. SINCE THE SCALE OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IS RELATIVELY LESS, THE ASSESSMENT WILL REQUIRE ONLY 2 DAYS. LIKEWISE, AS THE SC HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS IN THE RMG SECTOR FOR DECADES, ONLY 1 DAY IS NEEDED. THE ASSESSMENTS WILL INCLUDE PARTICIPATORY ANALYSIS OF THE SECTOR; KEY LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL ALLIES AND DECISION-MAKERS; UNIQUE NEEDS OF MARGINALIZED WORKER GROUPS IN THE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO OSH AND GBVH; AND RELEVANT CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTING TO AND PERPETUATING THE PROBLEMS. FOR CONSTRUCTION, SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA, WHICH ARE NEW SECTORS OF WORK, THE ASSESSMENT WILL INCLUDE IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND WORKPLACES WHERE THE PROGRAM HAS BOTH ACCESS AND POTENTIAL FOR THE GREATEST IMPACT. IN EACH ASSESSMENT, FACILITATORS WILL LEAD ANALYSIS OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES THAT WORKERS FROM MARGINALIZED GROUPS FACE. FACILITATORS WILL USE POPULAR EDUCATION TECHNIQUES TO ELICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PARTICIPANTS, APPLYING AN INTERSECTIONAL GENDER ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC NEEDS ARISING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN, GENDER DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS, AND ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN THE PROJECT SECTORS. DURING SENSITIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT GENDER EQUALITY AND GBVH, FACILITATORS WILL DIVIDE FOCUS GROUPS BY SEX TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PARTICIPANTS FEEL SAFE AND COMFORTABLE TO SHARE. THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT WILL IDENTIFY ANY THREATS TO SAFETY FOR ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKERS TAKING PART IN THE PROJECT, INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBLE ORIGINS OF THE THREATS, THE DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS ON MEN AND WOMEN, AND THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS. THE ASSESSMENT SESSIONS WILL INCLUDE PARTICIPATORY STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR PROJECT INTERVENTIONS, DEVELOP SUSTAINABILITY PLANS, AND BUILD DETAILED YEAR 1 WORK PLANS.\n\nDELIVERABLES\nTHE PROJECT ENVISIONS AN APPROACH TO STRENGTHEN WORKER ORGANIZATIONS AND IMPROVE WORKER KNOWLEDGE AROUND OSH AND GBVH. CENTRAL TO THIS STRATEGY WILL BE INCLUSION OF WOMEN WORKERS, WHO MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE RMG, SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA WORKFORCE, AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM, THE EXTREME MINORITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. THE STRATEGY IS ARTICULATED IN 6 PARTS, WHICH CORRESPOND TO THE PROJECT SUB-OUTCOMES:\n1. EDUCATE: THE INCREASED CAPACITY OF WORKERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN ON PROMOTING SAFER, HEALTHIER, AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WORKER ORGANIZATIONS IN EDUCATING AND ENGAGING THEIR MEMBERSHIP. THE SC WILL PRIORITIZE OSH AND LABOR RIGHTS TRAINING-OF-TRAINERS (TOT) IN ALL SECTORS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN WORKERS ON THEIR RIGHTS.\n2. REPRESENT: BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF WORKER ORGANIZATIONS TO REPRESENT MEMBERS TO PROMOTE SAFER, HEALTHIER, AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO TAKE UP WORKER PRIORITIES AND COLLECTIVELY DELIVER REAL CHANGE IN LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS. ACROSS THE FOUR SECTORS, THE SC WILL UTILIZE A MENU OF SAFETY COMMITTEE TRAININGS, GENDER EQUALITY AND GBVH TRAININGS, PARALEGAL CAPACITY BUILDING, AND LEGAL SUPPORT TO ADVANCE THIS STRATEGY.\n3. ADVOCATE: THE INCREASED CAPACITY OF WORKERS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO ADVOCATE FOR SAFER, HEALTHIER AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES WILL BE CRITICAL TO STRENGTHENING WORKER ORGANIZATIONS AND ADDRESSING OSH AND GBVH ISSUES IN THE TARGET SECTORS. IN CONSULTATION WITH PARTNERS, THE SC WILL UTILIZE A VARIETY OF MEDIUMS (DIGITAL, PRINT, AUDIO, ETC.) AND VENUES (CULTURAL CELEBRATIONS, COMMUNITY HEALTH CAMPS, ETC.) TO MAKE ADVOCACY CAMPAIGNS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND INCLUSIVE, WHICH IN TURN, INCREASES BUY-IN AND MAKES THEM MORE POWERFUL.\n4. ENGAGE: THE INCREASED ENGAGEMENT OF WORKERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS IN LAW AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION IS KEY TO IMPROVING WORKER ORGANIZATIONS' ABILITY TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE WORKERS' CONCERNS. TO SUPPORT PARTNERS IN THIS AREA, THE SC WILL CONDUCT AN OSH LEGAL AND POLICY GAP ANALYSIS, CONDUCT MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS, AND INITIATE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NATIONAL OSH COUNCIL.\n5. NEGOTIATE: THE STRENGTHENED CAPACITY OF WORKERS TO NEGOTIATE WITH EMPLOYERS ON WORKER RIGHTS ISSUES, INCLUDING OSH AND GBVH, IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE WORKER'S RIGHTS CONCERNS, INCLUDING OSH CONDITIONS AND GBVH. TO THAT END, THE SC WILL CONDUCT JOINT MANAGEMENT AND WORKER TRAININGS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING MENTORING. ALL STEPS WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY BROADER UNION CAPACITY BUILDING, WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO SUSTAINING THEIR ABILITY TO PROTECT AND REPRESENT WORKERS ON LABOR RIGHTS ISSUES, PARTICULARLY OSH AND GBVH.\n\nINTENDED BENEFICIARY\nIN BANGLADESH, THE TARGET WORKER POPULATION WILL INCLUDE MEN AND WOMEN WORKERS FROM THE RMG, SHRIMP FARMING, CONSTRUCTION, AND TEA SECTORS. THE MAJORITY OF RMG WORKERS ARE WOMEN, MANY OF WHOM ARE INTERNAL MIGRANTS. SHRIMP FARMERS IN KHULNA ARE MAJORITY WOMEN DAY LABORERS WORKING AT UNREGISTERED FARMS. THE TEA WORKERS ARE BASED IN THE SYLHET AREA AND ARE ALSO MAJORITY WOMEN WORKERS. THROUGH THIS PROJECT, THE SC WILL TARGET CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE DHAKA DIVISION, THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE MEN IN THE INFORMAL ECONOMY.\n\nSUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES\nTARGET WORKER AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR CAPACITY BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING INCLUDE BANGLADESH CHA SRAMIK UNION (BCSU), IMARAT NIRMAN SRAMIK UNION BANGLADESH (INSUB), AND RURAL AND URBAN POOR'S PARTNER FOR SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT (RUPSA).\nBCSU HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REPRESENTING TEA WORKERS SINCE ITS FOUNDING IN 1948. THE UNION IS THE LARGEST NATIONAL LABOR UNION IN BANGLADESH AND REPRESENTS MORE THAN 100,000 WORKERS OF WHICH TWO-THIRDS ARE WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE CHITTAGONG AND SYLHET REGION. BCSU HAS STRONG ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY, A SECTORAL CBA THAT IS UP FOR RENEWAL, AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF POOR OSH AND LABOR RIGHTS CONDITIONS IN THE TEA SECTOR. INSUB IS AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL TRADE UNION REPRESENTING OVER 60,000 WORKERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IN BANGLADESH. INSUB HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF ADVOCATING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WORKER RIGHTS, INCLUDING LIVING WAGES AND SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. INSUB IS ALSO AN ACTIVE AFFILIATE OF THE BANGLADESH TRADE UNION CENTER, WHICH IS A NATIONAL LEVEL FEDERATION.\nRUPSA IS A GRASSROOTS NGO REGISTERED IN 1994 AND BASED IN KHULNA, WORKING TO DEVELOP SOCIAL, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE LIVELIHOODS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES. RUPSA IS IMPLEMENTING ACTIVITIES IN THE KHULNA DISTRICT OF BANGLADESH IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: WORKERS' RIGHTS, HEALTH AND HYGIENE, MANGROVE REFORESTATION, LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT, AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT. RUPSA IS ALSO IMPLEMENTING AN SC SUBAWARD UNDER USAID'S WORKERS' EMPOWERMENT AND PARTICIPATION ACTIVITY. THROUGH THE SUBAWARD, RUPSA IS MANAGING A WORKER COMMUNITY CENTER AND IMPLEMENTING DOZENS OF ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES INCLUDING TRAINING ON FUNDAMENTAL LABOR RIGHTS AND OSH, MEMBERSHIP BUILDING AMONG THE WORKER COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION, AND STRATEGIC ADVOCACY FOR ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES. RUPSA HAS STRONG CONNECTIONS WITH SHRIMP FARMING WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE PROJECT'S TARGET GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "BGD", "Place of
