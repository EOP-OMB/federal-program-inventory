AN ASSESSMENT OF CORPUS CHRISTI BAY, THE UPPER LAGUNA MADRE, AND BAFFIN BAY WILL BE CONDUCTED. THIS TARGETED, INTENSIVE SEAGRASS SURVEY SUPPORTS THE STATE-WIDE TEXAS SEAGRASS MONITORING PROGRAM, ESTABLISHED BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT (TPWD), TEXAS GENERAL LAND OFFICE (TGLO), AND THE TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (TCEQ) IN THE 1999 SEAGRASS CONSERVATION PLAN. THIS TIER-2 SAMPLING EFFORT FOLLOWS PROTOCOLS ADOPTED BY STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND INTEGRATES PLANT CONDITION INDICATORS WITH LANDSCAPE FEATURE INDICATORS TO DETECT AND INTERPRET SEAGRASS BED DISTURBANCES AND ESTABLISH TRENDS IN SEAGRASS DISTRIBUTION AND HEALTH. INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THIS EFFORT PROVIDES INSIGHT REGARDING THE ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND HELPS DECISION MAKERS DETERMINE IF THE OBSERVED CHANGE NECESSITATES A REVISION OF REGULATORY POLICY OR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

THIS PROJECT WILL INCREASE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING AND STEWARDSHIP OF COASTAL BEND RESOURCES, IMPROVE WATER QUALITY, REDUCE DEBRIS REACHING THE BAY, AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF STORMWATER RUNOFF. THE CLASSROOM EDUCATION PROGRAM USES A SCALED RELIEF MODEL OF THE BAFFIN BAY BASIN, TEXAS ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS (TEKS) ALIGNED SCIENCE CURRICULUM, AND OTHER HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES TO SHOW STUDENTS HOW POLLUTANTS ENTER AND CONTAMINATE RIVERS, BAYS, AND AQUIFERS AND HOW EVERYONE CAN HELP PROTECT AND CONSERVE WATER RESOURCES. THE CURRICULUM REINFORCES 5TH-GRADE TEKS AND CULTIVATES STUDENTS UNDERSTANDING OF OUR WATER RESOURCES, INCLUDING WATERSHEDS AND RIVER BASINS. THESE HANDS-ON LESSONS HELP STUDENTS SEE WHERE THEIR WATER COMES FROM AND WHERE IT GOES.

THE SALINITY SENSOR WILL BE USED TO TRACE FRESHWATER INFLOWS FROM FRESHWATER PUMPING EVENTS VIA THE RINCON BAYOU PIPELINE FROM THE NUECES RIVER AND WILL REPORT WATER TEMPERATURE, CONDUCTIVITY, AND SALINITY EVERY 30 MINUTES. DATA FROM THIS SALINITY STATION IS BEING USED TO AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR THE RINCON BAYOU PIPELINE. THE CENTER FOR COASTAL STUDIES, THE HARTE RESEARCH INSTITUTE (HRI) AT TEXAS AANDM UNIVERSITY CORPUS CHRISTI (TAMUCC) USE THE SALINITY DATA PROVIDED FROM THE SALINITY STATIONS TO SUPPORT VARIOUS PROJECTS INVOLVING SAMPLING IN THE NUECES DELTA. DATA FROM THESE SALINITY STATIONS ARE ALSO UTILIZED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS (UT) AT AUSTIN AND THE UT MARINE SCIENCE INSTITUTE IN PORT ARANSAS TO SUPPORT VARIOUS MODELING PROJECTS WHICH ARE INVESTIGATING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN WATER IN SEDIMENT AND TIDAL CREEKS IN THE NUECES DELTA. THE NUECES DELTA HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL BEING CONDUCTED BY UT ALSO UTILIZED THE TIDE GAUGE DATA IN THE WESTERN NUECES BAY. SEVERAL TWDB FUNDED PROJECTS HAVE AND CURRENTLY ARE UTILIZING THE AVAILABLE DATA. THE NUECES DELTA ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROJECT SUPPORTS THE PROGRAM ELEMENTS 11 A., 11 B., 11 G., 11 H., AND 11 I. OF THE MARCH 31, 1994 106/604(B) GUIDANCE MEMO ISSUED BY EPA HEADQUARTERS. THIS ESTABLISHED MONITORING EFFORT SUPPORTS THE 1995 TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (THEN TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION COMMISSION) AGREED ORDER WHICH ESTABLISHED THE PROTOCOLS FOR THE REQUIRED FRESHWATER RELEASES TO THE NUECES ESTUARY. BY SUPPORTING ONGOING OPERATION OF FIXED SALINITY GAUGE AND METEOROLOGICAL MONITORING STATIONS IN THE NUECES DELTA AS WELL AS A SEA LEVEL MONITORING STATION IN NUECES BAY, THIS PROJECT MONITORS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FRESHWATER INFLOWS TO THE NUECES ESTUARY AND PROVIDES DATA NECESSARY FOR ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE NUECES ESTUARY ADVISORY COUNCIL (NEAC). THE WATER LEVEL MONITORING STATION ALSO SUPPORTS NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION'S (NOAA) CORPUS CHRISTI PORTSREG; MONITORING NETWORK, A DECISION SUPPORT TOOL THAT IMPROVES THE SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY OF MARITIME COMMERCE AND COASTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF REAL-TIME ENVIRONMENTAL OBSERVATIONS.
