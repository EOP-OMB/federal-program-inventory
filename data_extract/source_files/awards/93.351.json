CENTER - PROJECT SUMMARY THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A NONHUMAN PRIMATE DEVELOPMENTAL GENOTYPE-TISSUE EXPRESSION (NHP DGTEX) RESEARCH CENTER, DEVELOPED BY SCIENTISTS AT THE OREGON NATIONAL PRIMATE RESEARCH CENTER (ONPRC), MIT, THE BROAD INSTITUTE, AND YALE UNIVERSITY. THIS CENTER WILL PROVIDE A VITAL RESOURCE TO THE NIH DGTEX PROGRAM BY GENERATING A TWO-SPECIES NONHUMAN PRIMATE (NHP) RESOURCE WITH NUMEROUS BENEFITS, INCLUDING ACCESS TO PRENATAL DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES AND A BASIS FOR EVOLUTIONARY ANALYSIS OF DEVELOPMENTAL EXPRESSION PROGRAMS. FOR THIS PROPOSAL WE HAVE ELECTED TO GENERATE DATA FROM TWO SPECIES: MACACA MULATA (RHESUS MACAQUE), AN OLD- WORLD MONKEY, AND CALLITHIRIX JACCHUS (COMMON MARMOSET), A NEW-WORLD MONKEY. WE WILL CREATE A TISSUE RESOURCE OF 30 DIFFERENT TISSUES TYPES SAMPLED ACROSS 6 DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES IN BOTH SPECIES, PROFILING A TOTAL OF 198 ANIMALS IN THE PROCESS. USING THE REFERENCE TISSUE RESOURCE, WE WILL PERFORM TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING AND OTHER GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF SINGLE-CELL AND BULK TISSUES. TO FORM A ROBUST BASIS FOR ANALYSIS OF RNA-SEQ, WE BEGIN BY GENERATING FULL-TRANSCRIPT SEQUENCING FROM A PANEL OF TISSUES OF EACH SPECIES, WHICH WILL BE USED FOR ANNOTATING GENE MODELS. FOR EACH SPECIES WE WILL THEN GENERATE BULK RNA-SEQUENCING OF 30 TISSUES EACH FROM 12 INDIVIDUALS, SAMPLED FROM 6 TIMEPOINTS. WE PROPOSE TO USE MULTIOME SNRNA+ATAC SEQUENCING TO GENERATE A FIRST GENERATION SINGLE-CELL ATLAS FOR EACH SPECIES, COVERING 20 TOTAL TISSUES, WITH A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE BRAIN. THESE RNA-SEQ RESOURCES WILL BE COMPLEMENTED WITH STRATEGIC EPIGENETIC PROFILING BY CHIP-SEQ AND HI- C FOR ANNOTATION OF FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS. FINALLY, SPECIALIZED TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED TO GENERATE DATA FROM THE SMALLEST PRENATAL STAGES. WE WILL ADAPT THE BROAD INSTITUTE\u2019S GTEX RNA-SEQ ANALYSIS PIPELINE TO ACCOMMODATE SPECIES-SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND BIOLOGY, AND USE THE RESULTING PIPELINES TO ANALYZE THE BULK RNA-SEQ AND PERFORM EQTL MAPPING. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC, INTERACTIVE PLATFORM FOR THE SINGLE-CELL ATLASES THAT ENABLES EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS, HYPOTHESIS TESTING, AND COMPARISON ACROSS SPECIES. WE WILL USE OUR EXPERTISE IN COMPARATIVE GENOMICS TO IDENTIFY EVOLUTIONARILY CONSTRAINED EXPRESSION PATTERNS AND FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS, AS WELL AS HUMAN-SPECIFIC FEATURES, AND INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE FEATURES TO HUMAN DISEASE. WE WILL CREATE A SEARCHABLE INVENTORY OF ALL NHP TISSUES SAMPLED IN THE PROJECT, AND STANDARDIZE NHP DATA TYPES TO MATCH THE HUMAN DGTEX SPECIFICATIONS. TO FACILITATE COMMUNICATIONABOUT RESOURCE AVAILABILITYAND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, THE CENTER WILL INTEGRATE THE NHP DATA AND TISSUE INVENTORY DATABASE INTO THE PRIMARY DGTEX PORTAL TO BE GENERATED AND MAINTAINED BY THE BROAD INSTITUTE. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETIONOF THE PROJECT WILL CREATE A UNIQUE RESOURCE COMPRISING A COMPREHENSIVE NHP BIOSPECIMEN REPOSITORY SPANNING EARLY PRENATAL TO ADULT LIFE, AND A CORRESPONDING GENOMIC DATABASE TO BE MADE WIDELY ACCESSIBLE WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE GROUNDWORK AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MULTIPLE FUTURE RESEARCH STUDIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "27f21ab2-7b66-cad9-be60-5f435f28b02f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U24HG012483_7529"}, {"internal_id": 50096092, "Award ID": "U01TR001395", "Award Amount": 2266042.31, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2015-09-20", "CFDA Number": "93.310", "Description": "UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK METABOLOMICS CORE SUPPLEMENT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "74457bb7-b18d-9762-896e-e575e7a4ed82-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01TR001395_7529"}, {"internal_id": 86316196, "Award ID": "U01HL152405", "Award Amount": 5137038.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-21", "CFDA Number": "93.279", "Description": "COLORADO AMC REACH HUB", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": 1166125.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7f8eb9f7-3ee7-fb7d-c649-ee912e019c18-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01HL152405_7529"}, {"internal_id": 50095151, "Award ID": "U01HL127479", "Award Amount": 2991666.38, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2015-03-20", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "MIN-REACH RESEARCH EVALUATION AND COMMERCIALIZATION HUB", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "75c0ae0f-6a5f-aead-72df-d28c71c0d348-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01HL127479_7529"}, {"internal_id": 150290980, "Award ID": "T35OD033655", "Award Amount": 165987.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-07-15", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "CROSS-DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TRAINING FOR VETERINARY STUDENTS - PROGRAM SUMMARY THE PURPOSE OF THIS NEW T35 SHORT-TERM TRAINING PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE VETERINARY STUDENTS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM MENTORED RESEARCH OVER THE SUMMER MONTHS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A STRUCTURED EDUCATIONAL FRAMEWORK, THEREBY INTRODUCING THEM TO CAREER OPTIONS BASED IN BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE HAVE CREATED AN INTEGRATED PROGRAM ACROSS TUFTS UNIVERSITY CUMMINGS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE (TUCSVM) AND THE DIVISION OF COMPARATIVE MEDICINE AT MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (DCM-MIT) THAT PERMITS BROAD EXPOSURE TO RESEARCH INVOLVING INFECTIOUS DISEASE, MICROBIOME, COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, TOXICOLOGY, DRUG AND DEVICE DEVELOPMENT, AMONG OTHERS. THIS NEW PROGRAM BUILDS ON THE COMBINED EXPERIENCES OF THE MPIS (DRS. CHERYL LONDON AND KELLY METCALF PATE) AND LEVERAGES A LENGTHY HISTORY OF ACTIVELY ENGAGING DVM STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A VARIETY OF RESEARCH ENDEAVORS AT BOTH INSTITUTIONS. FIRST- AND SECOND-YEAR VETERINARY STUDENTS WILL BE RECRUITED FROM TUCSVM AS WELL AS FROM THE LARGER LANDSCAPE OF VETERINARY SCHOOLS ACROSS THE US AND CANADA TO WORK WITH 30 MENTORS REPRESENTING A WIDE ARRAY OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. IN ADDITION TO STANDARD ACTIVITIES COVERING RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH, FORMULATING A HYPOTHESIS/EXPERIMENTAL PLAN, ENSURING RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF DATA, AND CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, STUDENTS WILL HAVE ORGANIZED FIELD TRIPS TO VISIT UNIQUE FACILITIES AT THE HOST INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING THE NEW ENGLAND REGIONAL BIOCONTAINMENT LABORATORY, THE TUFTS CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE INSTITUTE, LOCAL INDUSTRY PARTNERS (PFIZER, SANOFI, TAKEDA), AND CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION (CHARLES RIVER, JACKSON LABORATORIES, CBSET). THEY WILL ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE WEEKLY SUMMER RESEARCH SEMINAR SERIES FEATURING VETERINARIANS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH ACROSS ACADEMIC CENTERS AND THE BIOTECHNOLOGY SECTOR. ALL STUDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE ANNUAL NATIONAL VETERINARY SCHOLARS SYMPOSIUM TO ENSURE WIDE SCIENTIFIC EXPOSURE AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NETWORKING. TRAINEES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO COMPLETE A FINAL WRITTEN REPORT SUMMARIZING THEIR FINDINGS AND CONTRIBUTE TO ASSOCIATED MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION AND EDITING WITH THEIR MENTORS. PROGRAMMATIC IMPACT WILL BE ASSESSED THROUGH A DETAILED QUESTIONNAIRE ADMINISTERED BEFORE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM, WITH THE GOAL OF ENGAGING IN YEARLY PROCESS IMPROVEMENT TO ENHANCE STUDENT EXPERIENCE. LONGITUDINAL TRACKING OF STUDENTS THROUGH COMPLETION OF THE DVM PROGRAM AND FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS THEREAFTER WILL PROVIDE A FORMAL MECHANISM TO DETERMINE RETENTION WITHIN THE BIOMEDICAL WORK FORCE. YEARLY FORMAL ASSESSMENTS BY THE EXTERNAL ADVISORY COUNCIL WILL FACILITATE OBJECTIVE EVALUATION OF MILESTONES AND INPUT REGARDING PROGRAMMATIC STRUCTURE. GIVEN THAT THIS IS A NEW COLLABORATIVE ENDEAVOR, 8 STUDENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR THE FIRST 3 YEARS, WITH EXPANSION TO 10 STUDENTS IN THE REMAINING TWO YEARS AS THE PROGRAM IS OPTIMIZED. IMPORTANTLY, THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WILL INSPIRE DVM STUDENTS TO CONSIDER A CAREER IN SCIENCE THROUGH PRODUCTIVE, POSITIVE IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES LED BY SUCCESSFUL AND ENGAGING MENTORS.", "Place of

X-RAY FELS PRODUCE EXTREMELY SHORT PULSES OF X-RAYS WHICH CAN BE EXPLOITED TO OBTAIN UNIQUE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND THE DYNAMICS OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. THESE SHORT BURSTS OF X-RAYS ALLOW DATA TO BE COLLECTED PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF RADIATION DAMAGE, RESULTING IN HIGHER RESOLUTION STRUCTURAL INFORMATION COMPARED TO MORE TRADITIONAL MEASUREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE ULTRASHORT PULSES ARE IDEAL TO STUDY FAST DYNAMICS. COMBINED WITH DATA COLLECTION UNDER AMBIENT CONDITIONS, RECENTLY DEVELOPED X-RAY FEL METHODS OF FEMTOSECOND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY PROVIDE UNIQUE CAPABILITIES TO STUDY BIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS UNDER PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT CONDITIONS WITH HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS THE TECHNIQUE OF FEMTOSECOND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY HAS EVOLVED FROM ITS FIRST DEMONSTRATION IN 2011 TO A VERY USEFUL TOOL FOR STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY. EVEN THOUGH THE FIELD OF FEMTOSECOND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY USING FEL SOURCES IS STILL YOUNG, THE DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY HAS RAPIDLY EVOLVED SINCE THE START OF OPERATIONS OF THE LINAC COHERENT LIGHT SOURCE (LCLS). THE DETECTOR SYSTEM CURRENTLY USED AT THE MACROMOLECULAR FEMTOSECOND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY (MFX) INSTRUMENT \u2013 THE FLAGSHIP INSTRUMENT FOR BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH AT LCLS \u2013 IS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTDATED AND IN GREAT NEED OF MODERNIZATION. A LARGE WORLDWIDE EFFORT TO DEVELOP NEW DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY HAS PRODUCED PARADIGM-CHANGING CAPABILITIES THAT ARE NOW AVAILABLE FOR SCIENTIFIC USE. HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE, FAST (>2 KHZ) DETECTORS WITH SINGLE PHOTON SENSITIVITY AND VERY LOW NOISE ARE NOW AVAILABLE. SUCH DETECTORS ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR ULTRASHORT PULSES FROM X-RAY FELS AND CAN MAXIMIZE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THE SINGLE SHOTS NECESSARY FOR DATA COLLECTION PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF RADIATION DAMAGE. THIS PROPOSAL IS TO PURCHASE A RECENTLY AVAILABLE JUNGFRAU 15M DETECTOR WHICH WILL SURPASS BY MORE THAN A FACTOR OF FIVE THE REPETITION RATE AND THE DYNAMIC RANGE OF THE DETECTOR CURRENTLY USED FOR SERIAL FEMTOSECOND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AT THE MFX INSTRUMENT AT LCLS, WHILE REDUCING THE NOISE LEVEL. THIS WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF LCLS FEMTOSECOND CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, ALLOWING MORE ACCESS TO THE FACILITY BY PROVIDING HIGHER QUALITY DATA FASTER. IT WILL ALSO ENABLE FUNDAMENTALLY NEW CAPABILITIES BY ALLOWING EVER MORE CHALLENGING BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED AT LCLS. THIS DETECTOR WILL KEEP MFX INSTRUMENT AT LCLS AT THE FOREFRONT OF X-RAY FEL BIOLOGY BY CONTINUING TO PROVIDE A WORLD-LEADING TOOL FOR SOLVING UNIQUELY CHALLENGING BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS THAT CONVENTIONAL METHODS CANNOT SOLVE.

ON THE ONE HAND, THE SYSTEM WOULD BE USED TO LOCALIZE VARIOUS PROTEINS AND CELLS USING FLUORESCENT LABELING APPROACHES, WHILE ON THE OTHER IT WOULD BE USED TO EXAMINE THE ACTIVITY OF LIVING CELLS AND TISSUES. THESE TWO IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES ARE REQUIRED AS THE NIH FUNDED MAJOR AND MINOR USER GROUP HAS DIVERSE NEEDS. THEIR RESEARCH ENCOMPASSES CARDIOVASCULAR PHYSIOLOGY, PREGNANCY, DEVELOPMENT, NEUROBIOLOGY, NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY, CANCER BIOLOGY, RADIATION MEDICINE, REGENERATIVE MEDICINE, AND HEALTH DISPARITIES, BUT ALL HAVE COMMON INTERESTS IN MEASURING THE SPATIAL APPOSITION BETWEEN CELLS, CHANGES IN PROTEIN EXPRESSION, LOCALIZATION OF PROTEINS WITHIN CELLS, AND SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SEQUENCES INVOLVED WITH CELL SIGNALING. THE RESEARCH RECORD OF THE USER GROUP IS EXCELLENT, REPRESENTING SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INVESTIGATORS AT THE INSTITUTION. THE ZEISS LSM 900 CONFOCAL WOULD SUPPORT NUMEROUS NIH RESEARCH GRANTS AND INVESTIGATIVE PROGRAMS ACROSS CAMPUS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. THE CORE FACILITY HAS TWO SHARED-USE CONFOCAL MICROSCOPES THAT ARE NEAR OR AT THEIR END OF FUNCTIONAL USE. ACQUISITION OF A ZEISS LSM 900 WITH A AIRYSCAN 2 WILL SOLVE THIS PRESSING ISSUE AND WILL ENABLE FUNDED RESEARCHERS TO CONTINUE THEIR STUDIES INCLUDING CELL SIGNALING, IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION, PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND LOCALIZATION, CELL AND TISSUE MORPHOLOGY, INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MOLECULES AND PROTEINS, SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION, SPATIAL-TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND SUBCELLULAR TRANSPORT. THESE QUESTIONS REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO IMAGE SINGLE OR MULTIPLE FLUORESCENT PROBES IN EITHER FIXED OR LIVE PREPARATIONS. BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE FUNDED PROJECTS, A ZEISS LSM 900 CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE IS AN IDEAL REPLACEMENT INSTRUMENT. THE INSTRUMENT HAS 2 HIGH-SENSITIVITY CONFOCAL CHANNELS FOR RECORDING FLUORESCENCE; ONE FOR TRANSMITTED LIGHT (DIC) AND HAS AN AIRYSCAN 2 UNIT FOR SUPER-RESOLUTION IMAGING ALONG WITH ADAPTIVE FOCUSING CAPABILITIES AND CAN PERFORM MOSAIC TILING FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION.

THIS SYSTEM WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO AND MANAGED BY THE PRE-CLINICAL CARDIOVASCULAR (PCC) CORE FACILITY WITHIN THE DIVISION OF CARDIOLOGY/DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS (AMC). DUE TO THE HIGHLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY OF THE VEVO F2, THIS SYSTEM WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF THE PCC CORE AND WOULD ENHANCE ON-GOING, SYSTEM-WIDE COLLABORATIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE ADVANCED ULTRASOUND CAPABILITIES THAT LEAD TO A MORE DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AND HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE TRANSLATED INTO INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS FOR HUMAN DISEASES. OUR GOAL IS TO DO THE BEST SCIENCE POSSIBLE AND BE GUIDED BY THE DATA. HAVING A VEVO F2 INSTRUMENT IN OUR PCC CORE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HELP US ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE PCC CORE TO FACILITATE STUDIES EMPLOYING MOUSE AND RAT MODELS OF CARDIOVASCULAR, PULMONARY, RENAL, METABOLIC AND ONOCOLOGIC DISEASES. OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO TRANSLATE FINDINGS MADE IN THESE PRE-CLINICAL MODELS INTO NOVEL THERAPEUTICS FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEVASTATING DISEASES IN HUMANS. WE COLLABORATE CLOSELY WITH RESEARCH GROUPS ACROSS THE CAMPUS, AND THE ENTIRE DENVER METROPOLITAN AREA, TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLES OF HEART:KIDNEY AND HEART:LUNG CROSS-TALK IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF CARDIORENAL DISEASE AND PULMONARY VASCULAR/RIGHT VENTRICULAR REMODELING. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE COLLABORATIONS FOCUSED ON VASCULAR STIFFENING, IMPAIRED BLOOD FLOW, METABOLIC DISEASE, TUMOR METASTASIS, BIOMARKER DISCOVERY AND CONTRAST IMAGING IN RODENT MODELS (SEE FIGURE). ALL OF THESE EFFORTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE ACQUISITION OF A VEVO F2 INSTRUMENT, WHICH WOULD ENABLE STATE-OF-THE-ART, NON-INVASIVE, LONGITUDINAL MEASUREMENTS OF CARDIAC STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, RENAL, CARDIAC AND PANCREATIC BLOOD FLOW, AND TUMOR FORMATION IN MOUSE AND RAT MODELS. IN ADDITION, THIS HIGH-DEFINITION ULTRASOUND SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE AN INVALUABLE TOOL FOR MONITORING LOCALIZED DELIVERY OF CELLS AND THERAPEUTIC AGENTS VIA INTRA-CARDIAC OR PORTAL VEIN INJECTION. THE VEVO F2, WHICH HAS MANY FEATURES IN COMMON WITH CLINICAL INSTRUMENTS, WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON NIH-FUNDED RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FACILITATE TRANSLATION OF BASIC SCIENCE DISCOVERIES INTO INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS FOR HUMAN DISEASE.

HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION, HIGH SENSITIVITY AND OUTSTANDING TIME-OF-FLIGHT CAPABILITY, AS WELL AS IN-LINE INTEGRATION WITH X-RAY CT MEAN THE NEW SCANNER WILL GREATLY IMPROVE UPON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY. THIS ENHANCED TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE WILL TRANSLATE TO HIGHER IMAGE QUALITY AND QUANTITATIVE PARAMETERS WITH GREATER ACCURACY AND IMPROVED STATISTICAL RELIABILITY. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL AIMS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENT AT JOHNS HOPKINS. THE PET CENTER HAS WELL-EQUIPPED RADIOCHEMISTRY FACILITIES AND MUCH EXPERIENCE IN RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT, PET IMAGING METHODOLOGY AND QUANTITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS. THERE IS ALSO A LARGE POOL OF NIH FUNDED INVESTIGATORS WHO HAVE STRUGGLED FOR SOME TIME WITH OLD, UNRELIABLE PET SYSTEMS AND LIMITED ACCESS TO PET/CT. GREATER ACCESS AND IMPROVED IMAGING CAPABILITY WILL ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF DATA COLLECTION AND ACCELERATE ACCRUAL OF LARGE DATA SETS. FURTHERMORE, THE NEW CAPABILITIES AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED SCANNER WILL BROADEN THE RANGE OF STUDIES THAT ARE POSSIBLE, ENCOURAGING NEW RESEARCH APPLICATIONS AND WIDER ADOPTION OF PET ACROSS THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPORT AND ENHANCE NIH-FUNDED RESEARCH IN NEUROSCIENCES, ONCOLOGY, CARDIOLOGY AND OTHER AREAS INCLUDING INFECTION. THE EXQUISITE SENSITIVITY OF PET AND ITS UNIQUE CAPABILITY TO TARGET MOLECULAR PROCESSES IN-VIVO WILL DRIVE ADVANCES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE. IN ADDITION, THE QUANTITATIVE CAPABILITY OF PET CAN HELP DEVELOP AND ASSESS NEW TREATMENT OPTIONS, PROVIDING OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE FOR TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS AT AN EARLY TIME POINT.

IN 2020 ALONE, THEY PUBLISHED OVER 30 PEER-REVIEWED MEG-CENTRIC PUBLICATIONS, HAD NUMEROUS MAJOR NIH AWARDS, AND MADE HIGH IMPACT DISCOVERIES SPANNING MULTIPLE AREAS OF HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE. MEG IS AN ADVANCED METHOD FOR NONINVASIVELY IMAGING POPULATION-LEVEL NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY WITH HIGH TEMPORAL (< 1 MS) AND SPATIAL PRECISION (2-3 MM). APPLICATION OF THE METHOD HAS EXPANDED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PAST DECADE DUE TO TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENTS AND THE GROWING INTEREST IN NEURAL OSCILLATIONS, DYNAMIC CONNECTIVITY, AND OTHER METRICS WHERE SPATIOTEMPORAL PRECISION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THE OMAHA MEG GROUP HAS HAD A MAJOR ROLE IN THIS GROWTH AND CONTINUES TO LEAD THE WAY IN MANY AREAS OF MEG RESEARCH, OFTEN EXCEEDING ALL OTHER MEG SITES ON MAJOR MEASURES OF SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPACT. HOWEVER, THIS GROUP IS NOW AT A CROSSROADS WHERE THEIR FUTURE GROWTH, AND EVEN EXISTENCE, IS THREATENED BY A REVOLUTIONARY PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE FIELD OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL IMAGING, AND A WORLDWIDE HELIUM SHORTAGE. BRIEFLY, CONVENTIONAL MEG SYSTEMS ARE LARGE AND STATIONARY, REQUIRING RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS TO SIT AS STILL AS POSSIBLE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME WHILE UNDERGOING RECORDINGS. THIS CREATES MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR ACQUIRING DATA IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. FURTHER, THE DIMENSIONS OF THE SENSOR ARRAY ARE FIXED WITHIN THE MEG HELMET, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE 98% OF ADULTS. THIS TRANSLATES INTO LARGE GAPS BETWEEN THE SCALP SURFACE AND THE SENSOR ARRAY IN YOUNG CHILDREN AND HUGE GAPS IN INFANTS. SINCE THE STRENGTH OF MAGNETIC FIELDS FALL OFF EXPONENTIALLY WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE CURRENT SOURCE (I.E., ACTIVE NEURAL POPULATIONS), THE NET IMPACT OF THIS IS STRONGLY ATTENUATED NEURAL RESPONSES IN CHILDREN AND INFANTS AND THUS POOR PRECISION. ADDITIONALLY, CONVENTIONAL MEG REQUIRES LIQUID HELIUM TO SUPPORT SUPERCONDUCTING TEMPERATURES, WHICH IS NOT ONLY VERY EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IN THE CURRENT ERA OF HELIUM SHORTAGES. GIVEN THESE CONCERNS, WE ARE PROPOSING TO PURCHASE A STATE-OF-THE-ART OPTICALLY- PUMPED MAGNETOMETRY (OPM) SYSTEM. THE IDEA OF OPM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES, BUT MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS THROUGH PRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019S BRAIN INITIATIVE HAVE MOVED THE TECHNOLOGY FROM A PHYSICS EXPERIMENT TO CUTTING EDGE APPLICATIONS IN NEUROSCIENCE. OPM IS THE FUTURE OF MEG, AS IT OVERCOMES THE KEY LIMITATIONS OF CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS AND IN MOST CASES OFFERS SUPERIOR PRECISION. SPECIFICALLY, OPM: (1) DOES NOT REQUIRE LIQUID HELIUM AND THUS SENSORS CAN BE PLACED DIRECTLY ON THE SCALP FOR OPTIMAL SENSITIVITY, (2) CAN BE FITTED TO ANY HEAD SIZE, INCLUDING PEDIATRIC AND INFANT POPULATIONS, AND (3) ALLOWS PARTICIPANTS TO MOVE RELATIVELY FREELY DURING RECORDINGS, MAKING THE SYSTEM IDEAL FOR DEVELOPMENTAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS, AS WELL AS NATURALISTIC EXPERIMENTS (E.G., WALKING). THUS, OPM IS A SIGNIFICANT, MAJOR STEP FORWARD AND WILL GIVE RISE TO A WHOLE NEW ERA OF FUNCTIONAL IMAGING.

THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT AUTOMATED DATA ACQUISITION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING INFRASTRUCTURE AT SCRIPPS HAS ENABLED MUCH OF OUR FACULTY TO INTEGRATE CRYO-EM STRUCTURE DETERMINATION METHODOLOGIES INTO THEIR RESEARCH PROGRAMS, AND AS A RESULT, THE DEMAND ON THE CRYO-EM FACILITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE EVERY YEAR. THE EM FACILITY AT SCRIPPS RESEARCH CURRENTLY MAINTAINS TWO ELECTRON MICROSCOPES CAPABLE OF GENERATING HIGH-RESOLUTION SINGLE PARTICLE CRYO-EM STRUCTURES - A TITAN KRIOS AND AN TALOS ARCTICA, BOTH OF WHICH ACQUIRE IMAGES WITH ~10-YEAR-OLD GATAN K2 SUMMIT DIRECT DETECTORS. HOWEVER, DESPITE NEARLY 24/7 OPERATION OF THESE TWO INSTRUMENTS, MICROSCOPE ACCESS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LIMITED DUE TO HIGH USER DEMAND. CURRENTLY, USERS MUST WAIT TEN TO TWELVE WEEKS BETWEEN CRYO-EM DATA COLLECTION SESSIONS, WHICH IS CONSEQUENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE PROGRESS OF DOZENS OF ONGOING NIH-FUNDED PROJECTS WITHIN THE INSTITUTE. THE REQUESTED K3 DETECTOR HAS IMPROVED DETECTIVE QUANTUM EFFICIENCY, INLINE GPU-BASED MOTION CORRECTION, FASTER READ-OUT RATES, AND A LARGER FIELD OF VIEW THAN THE EXISTING K2 CAMERA. TOGETHER, WE ESTIMATE THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL RESULT IN A ~5.6-FOLD INCREASE IN THE RATE OF DATA COLLECTION ON THE TITAN KRIOS, ENABLING ACQUISITION OF THOUSANDS MORE DATASETS PER YEAR THAN CURRENTLY POSSIBLE. ACQUISITION OF THIS K3 CAMERA WOULD ALSO ENABLE US TO MOUNT THE EXISTING K2 ON OUR TALOS 200C MICROSCOPE, FURTHER INCREASING THE EFFICACY OF OUR EM FACILITY AND BENEFITING OUR RESEARCHERS.

WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT VISUALIZATION OF MOLECULES OF INTEREST, USING DYES OR FLUOROPHORES, IN THE CONTEXT OF BOTH THEIR SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL LOCATION WITHIN CELLS OR TISSUES IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING PHYSIOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES OF NORMAL VERSUS DISEASED STATES. SUPER-RESOLUTION MICROSCOPY HAS BECOME A KEY TECHNOLOGY IN PROVIDING THIS CONTEXT. HOWEVER, AN INCREASE IN SPATIAL RESOLVING POWER OFTEN REQUIRES A SACRIFICE IN TEMPORAL RESOLUTION I.E. THE SPEED AT WHICH MOLECULAR KINETICS OF FLUOROPHORES CAN BE OBSERVED, WHICH NECESSITATES CAREFUL SELECTION OF THE SUPER-RESOLUTION MODE REQUIRED TO FULFILL EXPERIMENTAL NEEDS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, SBP REQUESTS SUPPORT FOR A ZEISS LSM980 WITH AIRYSCAN 2. THE LSM980 IS CAPABLE OF SIMULTANEOUSLY IMAGING UP TO 4 DIFFERENT FLUOROPHORES WITH WELL-SEPARATED, NON-OVERLAPPING EMISSION SPECTRA WITH A TWO-FOLD INCREASE IN SPATIAL RESOLUTION. THE MULTIPLEX MODES, ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE LSM980, CAN SPEED UP IMAGE ACQUISITION UP TO TWENTY FIVE-FOLD BEYOND ACQUISITION RATES ON TYPICAL POINT-SCANNING CONFOCAL MICROSCOPES, AND STILL PROVIDE A NEAR TWO-FOLD INCREASE IN SPATIAL RESOLUTION. THIS SPEED IS ESSENTIAL IN STUDYING HIGHLY DYNAMIC MECHANISMS THAT REQUIRE HIGHER SPATIAL RESOLUTION, SUCH AS VESICULAR TRAFFICKING, TRANSIENT MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS OR EPIGENETIC CHANGES. THE ABILITY TO GAUGE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN THESE HIGHLY DYNAMIC EVENTS WILL GIVE OUR USERS A BETTER GRASP OF MOLECULAR CHANGES THAT OCCUR FROM HEALTHY TO DISEASED SYSTEMS. THIS SPEED OF THE MULTIPLEX MODES IS ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR FIXED THICK TISSUE IMAGING (>200\u039cM) WHERE LARGE FIELDS OF VIEW OR THICK SLICES CAN BE IMAGED IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME, AT SUPER-RESOLUTION. THE LSM980 BRINGS ADDITIONAL IMAGING BENEFITS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AT SBP. THE QUASAR DETECTOR PERMITS SIMULTANEOUS IMAGING OF THE FULL EMISSION SPECTRUM I.E. ALL FLUOROPHORES. THE LSM980 IS MORE SENSITIVE TO WEAK SAMPLES AND LESS SENSITIVE TO BACKGROUND NOISE, AND THE NEWLY ADDED AIRYSCAN JOINT DECONVOLUTION PROCESSING PROVIDES 90NM SPATIAL RESOLUTION. THESE FEATURES MAKE IT ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECTS REQUIRING SUPER-RESOLUTION IMAGING OF THICK SAMPLES, FOR E.G. ORGANOIDS, CELL CLUSTERS OR DROSOPHILA EMBRYOS.

TO TRULY MAKE BNIER A WORLD CLASS ELEMENTAL IMAGING FACILITY WE PROPOSED TO UPGRADE THE CURRENT TEAC LA-ICP-MS INSTRUMENTATION TO A FASTER LASER ABLATION SYSTEM WITH AN ULTRAFAST WASHOUT CELL (IMAGEBIO266, ELEMENTAL SCIENTIFIC LASERS, BOZEMAN, MT) AND A TIME-OF-FLIGHT ICP-MS (ICPTOF).

THE IMAGING CORE FACILITY HAS TWO AGING LASER SCANNING CONFOCAL SYSTEMS USING PINHOLES, ZEISS LSM 700 (10+ YEAR OLD) AND LSM 780 (6+ YEAR OLD). THEY ARE BEING HEAVILY USED BY A DIVERSE GROUP OF BIOMEDICAL INVESTIGATORS FOR IMAGING CELL AND TISSUE SAMPLES SPAN MULTIPLE MAJOR DEPARTMENTS/INSTITUTES AT GSU AND NEARBY INSTITUTIONS. THE ANNUAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS FOR BOTH SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO BE DISCONTINUED BY ZEISS IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE GUARANTEED. ANY UNEXPECTED BREAKDOWN OF THE SYSTEMS WILL CAUSE TREMENDOUS DISRUPTIONS TO THE ONGOING NIH-FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECTS IN TERMS OF TIME AND RESEARCH FUNDS. BESIDES, THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH A HIGH-END CONFOCAL SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE A UNIQUE TOOL TO EXTEND THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM HIGH-SPEED IMAGING WITH GREATLY REDUCED PHOTOTOXICITY AND IMPROVED RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY FOR IMAGING CELL AND TISSUE SECTION SAMPLES. IT WILL BE A GREAT ADDITION TO THE FACILITY TO GUARANTEE THE CONTINUED SUPPORT TO VARIED NIH-FUNDED PROJECTS. IT WILL ALSO HELP THE INVESTIGATORS TO ADVANCE AND ACCELERATE THEIR RESEARCH PROJECTS BEYOND THEIR CURRENT LIMITATIONS. THE FACILITY HAS DEDICATED SPACE AND CRITICAL PERSONNEL IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THE ACQUISITION AND DAILY OPERATION OF THE PROPOSED CONFOCAL SYSTEM AS WELL AS A VIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL PLAN WITH STRONG INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT TO ENSURE THE LONG-TERM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPOSED CONFOCAL SYSTEM TO MAXIMIZE THE SUPPORT AND IMPACT TO CURRENT AND FUTURE NIH-FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECTS WITH CUTTING-EDGE IMAGING CAPABILITIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fafdc950-0302-1107-c64c-74fb82b7ab42-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD032336_7529"}, {"internal_id": 149791959, "Award ID": "S10OD032333", "Award Amount": 249082.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-06-17", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "SARTORIOUS OCTET R8 SYSTEM - PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT THE PROPOSED S10 PROJECT ENTITLED \u201cOCTET R8 SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR INTERACTION STUDIES IN INFECTIOUS AND NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASES\u201d IS TO RESPOND TO PAR-21-125 BASIC INSTRUMENTATION GRANT (BIG) PROGRAM. THE MISSION OF THE ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTATION CORE (AIC) AT BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER (BMC) AND BOSTON UNIVERSITY (BU) IS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND TRAINING TO INVESTIGATORS THROUGH CUTTING-EDGE ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTS AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION.

THE AIC MEETS THIS GOAL BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MODERN, SOPHISTICATED HIGH-PRICED INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ADVANCING THE RESEARCH OF MULTIPLE BIOMEDICAL INVESTIGATORS. THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE TYPICALLY COST-PROHIBITIVE FOR INDIVIDUAL SCIENTISTS TO PURCHASE, OPERATE, AND MAINTAIN.

THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CAM\u2019S SUPER RESOLUTION IMAGING HAS BEEN PERFORMED IN FIXED SAMPLES. THIS IS BECAUSE STORM IS NOT READILY COMPATIBLE FOR LIVE IMAGING, AND OUR SIM SYSTEM USES TRADITIONAL DIFFRACTION GRATING TO GENERATE THE ILLUMINATION PATTERN, WHICH IS TOO SLOW FOR MANY DYNAMIC CELLULAR PROCESSES. ADDITIONALLY, SIM IMAGING DEPENDS ON GENERATING ILLUMINATION PATTERS ON THE SAMPLE, WHICH DEGRADE AS ONE IMAGES DEEPER INTO TISSUE. THE NIKON SORA CAN PRODUCE SUPER RESOLUTION IMAGES, SIMILAR IN RESOLUTION TO THOSE GENERATED BY THE SIM SYSTEM AT A MUCH FASTER CAPTURE RATE OF UP TO 30 FRAMES PER SECOND.

WE SEEK FUNDS TO REPLACE A WORKHORSE INSTRUMENT\u2014A HIGH-FREQUENCY ULTRASOUND AND PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGING SYSTEM THAT IS VITAL TO SUSTAINING EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCTIVITY OF A LARGE AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AT UC SAN DIEGO. PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGING IS AN OPTICAL TECHNIQUE THAT CONVERTS INCIDENT EXCITATION LIGHT INTO ACOUSTIC WAVES; IT MELDS THE CONTRAST AND SPECTRAL BEHAVIOR OF OPTICS WITH THE SPATIAL/TEMPORAL RESOLUTION AND PENETRATION DEPTH OF ULTRASOUND. THE ONLY PHOTOACOUSTIC SCANNER IN SAN DIEGO IS AT UCSD AND WAS PURCHASED IN 2016 UNDER AN S10 GRANT. THIS EXISTING SCANNER HAS YIELDED EXTRAORDINARY VALUE: THREE-FOLD MORE PUBLICATIONS PER YEAR THAN ANY OTHER S10-SUPPORTED PHOTOACOUSTIC INSTRUMENTATION OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. HOWEVER, THE SCANNER IS NOW AT THE END OF ITS FIVE-YEAR LIFESPAN AND HAS DEVELOPED DEVASTATING RELIABILITY ISSUES AND WILL SOON NO LONGER BE SUPPORTED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THEREFORE, WE HAVE AN URGENT NEED TO REPLACE THIS SCANNER AND THUS MAINTAIN AND EXPAND THE RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR USER GROUP. WE PROPOSE TO REPLACE OUR NEARLY DEFUNCT VISUALSONICS 2100 + LAZR WITH A VISUALSONICS 3100 + LAZR-X IMAGING SYSTEM FOR DEDICATED SMALL ANIMAL IMAGING. VISUALSONICS IS THE ONLY OPTION FOR HIGH FREQUENCY (>40 MHZ) IMAGING, WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR OUR USERS WHO STUDY CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, CANCER, AND OTHER DISEASES IN RODENT MODELS (SMALL ANIMALS = SMALL ORGANS = SMALL FEATURE SIZES = NEED FOR BETTER SPATIAL RESOLUTION = NEED FOR HIGH FREQUENCY). THIS SAME SCANNER WILL PROVIDE A SUITE OF CARDIAC AND VASCULAR IMAGING TOOLS (E.G., STRAIN, EJECTION FRACTION, MYOCARDIAL VELOCITY) IN ADDITION TO PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGING. THUS, THIS IS TWO SCANNERS IN ONE, WHICH ALLOWS US TO DOUBLE OUR USER BASE AT NO ADDITIONAL COST. OUR USER GROUP INCLUDES RESEARCHERS STUDYING CARDIOVASCULAR, PULMONARY, AND VASCULAR DISEASE (CHRISTMAN, CONTIJOCH, DILLMANN, MAKINO, PILZ, SHYY, VILLARREAL, WEBSTER, YUAN); CANCER BIOLOGY, DETECTION, AND TREATMENT (ENGLER, JOKERST, STEINMETZ, WANG, WEBSTER); AND RESEARCHERS DEVELOPING NEW MATERIALS FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS (CHRISTMAN, ENGLER, JOKERST, KWON, STEINMETZ, ZHANG). THIS SCANNER IS A GOOD INVESTMENT FOR NIH FOR SEVERAL REASONS: 1) OUR WELL-DOCUMENTED RECORD OF PRODUCTIVITY WITH PRIOR S10 FUNDS AND OTHER FEDERAL GRANTS; 2) THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE OF THE PI AND MAIN USERS WHO COLLECTIVELY PUBLISHED 80+ PAPERS IN PHOTOACOUSTICS AND CARDIOVASCULAR ULTRASOUND; 3) OUR LARGE AND ROBUST USER GROUP (15 PIS; 33 GRANTS; 18 R01S); AND 4) UC SAN DIEGO\u2019S STRONG COMMITMENT TO COMMISSIONING AND OPERATING THE SCANNER THROUGHOUT ITS LIFETIME AS EXEMPLIFIED BY $110,000 IN MATCHING FUNDS AND DEDICATED SPACE WITH TECHNICIAN.

UNIQUE AS AN INSTRUMENT, THE BIGFOOT SORTER COMBINES THE STRENGTHS OF HIGH-PARAMETER, HIGH-CONTENT IMAGING (MULTI-LASER, HIGH-DETECTOR) WITH MODERN FULL-SPECTRUM TECHNOLOGIES (ALGORITHMIC SPECTRAL UNMIXING). OUR ONGOING NIH-FUNDED RESEARCH IS HAMPERED BY THE INABILITY TO DIRECTLY TRANSITION COMPLEX, VALIDATED PANELS FROM PITT'S THREE SPECTRAL ANALYZERS TO AN EQUIVALENT SPECTRAL CELL SORTER. IN SPECTRAL APPROACHES, THE FULL SPECTRUM OF LIGHT EMITTED FROM EACH CELL IS COLLECTED BY MULTIPLE DETECTORS FOLLOWED BY UNMIXING TO SEPARATE THE SIGNAL INTO INDIVIDUAL MARKERS. SPECTRAL CYTOMETRY EXPANDS PARAMETER SPACE BY PERMITTING THE USE OF NEW FLUORS AND ALSO NEW COMBINATIONS OF EXISTING FLUORS THAT COULD NOT PREVIOUSLY BE PAIRED TOGETHER IN CONVENTIONALLY CONFIGURED CYTOMETERS (I.E., ONE DETECTOR, ONE COLOR SYSTEMS). ALL OF THE SORTERS AT PITT ARE THE CONVENTIONAL CONFIGURATION TYPE. THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT MOST OR ALL OF OUR HIGHLY COMPLEX IMMUNOPHENOTYPIC SPECTRAL PANELS HAVE TO BE SCALED DOWN, ADAPTED TO FEWER DETECTORS, AND RE-VALIDATED FOR COMPATIBILITY WITH EXISTING CONVENTIONAL SORTERS, ALL OF WHICH FAILS TO CAPTURE THE ORIGINAL COMPLEXITY AND NOVEL INFORMATION TANTALIZINGLY REVEALED BY THE SPECTRAL ANALYZERS.

ALTHOUGH ROBOTIC EXOSKELETONS HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL, CURRENT DEVICES FALL SHORT OF SAFELY RESTORING MOBILITY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS.

THE GROWING DEMAND FOR ROBOTIC EXOSKELETONS HAS EXPOSED TWO CRITICAL BARRIERS TO SAFE AND SUSTAINED USE: 1) THE BOUNDS OF HUMAN-ROBOT PERFORMANCE DURING EAL ARE NOT WELL-UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE EMPIRICAL DATA UNDER CONTROLLED LABORATORY SETTINGS DO NOT EXIST OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY; AND 2) IT IS DIFFICULT AND PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TO CONDUCT THE NECESSARY EXPERIMENTS TO CHARACTERIZE SYSTEMATICALLY HUMAN-ROBOT PERFORMANCE DURING EAL.

THE BERKELEY CENTER FOR STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY (BCSB) OPERATES SIX MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY BEAMLINES AT THE ALS. ITS LATEST UNDULATOR-BASED MICROFOCUS BEAMLINE, GEMINI, IS JUST STARTING OPERATION AND AVAILABLE TO NIH USERS. BCSB HAS RECEIVED FUNDS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SECOND MICROFOCUS BEAMLINE FROM THE SAME SOURCE. BUILDING A SECOND BRANCH THAT PROVIDES A HIGH BRIGHTNESS USER-FOCUSABLE BEAM DOWN TO 15 MICRONS IS REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE NATIONAL DEMAND FOR HIGH BRIGHTNESS SMALL-BEAM CRYSTALLOGRAPHY IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE EXISTING MICROFOCUS BEAMLINES ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED AND DEMAND FAR EXCEEDS CAPACITY. ADDRESSING THIS LACK OF NATIONAL CAPACITY NOW IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL, AS WE PREPARE FOR HALF OF THE TOTAL U.S. SYNCHROTRON MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY RESOURCES GOING DARK IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THE UPCOMING MAJOR UPGRADE OF THE ADVANCED PHOTON SOURCE AND THE ENORMOUS IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE ON NIH-FUNDED INVESTIGATORS. GUIDED BY THE EXPERTISE OF THE BCSB DEVELOPMENT TEAM, OUR BEAMLINES PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART CAPABILITIES IN AUTOMATION, SOFTWARE PROCESSING, AND HARDWARE CONTROL; THE ADDITION OF A LARGE SURFACE AREA, FAST-READOUT, HIGH-END DETECTOR SYSTEM AT GEMINI WILL COMPLEMENT THE QUALITIES OF THE NEW GEMINI BEAMLINE AND ALLOW FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNIQUES IN MULTI- TEMPERATURE CRYSTALLOGRAPHY AND SYNCHROTRON SERIAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. PHOTON COUNTING PIXEL ARRAY DETECTORS ARE THE GOLD STANDARD IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY DUE TO THEIR ZERO NOISE, HIGH FRAME RATE, EXCELLENT POINT-SPREAD FUNCTION, AND HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE; THEY HAVE BECOME STANDARD AT MANY NATIONAL SYNCHROTRON FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THESE DETECTORS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL IN THE SUCCESS OF MANY STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY PROJECTS AND THE LATEST DESIGN BY DECTRIS, THE EIGER2, HAVE MARKED IMPROVEMENTS ON THE SPEED AND QUANTUM EFFICIENCY OF DETECTORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT THE ALS. THE EIGER2 S 16M HAS ZERO DEADTIME DUE TO ITS TWO COUNTERS PER PIXEL THAT ENABLES FINE SLICING DATA COLLECTION THAT CAN REDUCE RADIATION DAMAGE\u2014ESPECIALLY IN MULTI-TEMPERATURE EXPERIMENTS. THE HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE MEANS BOTH STRONG AND WEAK REFLECTIONS CAN BE COLLECTED SIMULTANEOUSLY, AND THE LARGE SURFACE AREA COMBINED WITH A SINGLE PIXEL POINT-SPREAD-FUNCTION ALLOWS COLLECTION ON SAMPLES WITH LARGE UNIT CELLS AND/OR HIGH RESOLUTION.

THE UPGRADED INSTRUMENT WILL BE HOUSED WITHIN THE PROGRAM IN MEMBRANE BIOLOGY (PMB) MICROSCOPY CORE AT THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL (MGH) IN THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY SIMCHES RESEARCH CENTER BUILDING. THE MANDATE OF THIS MGH-APPROVED CORE FACILITY IS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO A FULL RANGE OF MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES TO 2 NIH FUNDED P30 CENTERS AND INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH GROUPS WITHIN THE MGH COMMUNITY AND BEYOND. THE CORE HAS CONSIDERABLE EXPERTISE IN STATIC AND LIVE CELL IMAGING TECHNIQUES USED BY OUR EXTENSIVE USER-BASE OVER THE YEARS. OUR IMAGING CAPABILITES WERE ENHANCED 4 YEARS AGO BY THE ACQUISITION OF A ZEISS LSM800 AIRYSCAN CONFOCAL PLATFORM TO FUNCTION ALONGSIDE THE OLDER NIKON A1R. TOGETHER THESE INSTRUMENTS HAVE PROVIDED SUFFICIENT HIGH LEVEL IMAGING BANDWIDTH TO SERVE OUR USERS. THE NIKON A1R IS EXTENSIVELY USED FOR LONGER TERM, LIVE CELL IMAGING AND HAS AN INVERTED MICROSCOPE AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL CHAMBER TO FACILIATE THIS NEED. THE LSM800, ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPRIGHT MICROSCOPE AND NO ENVIRONMENTAL CHAMBER, PROVIDES CONSISTENT AND TIMELY ACCESS TO A HIGH RESOLUTION CONFOCAL THAT IS MOSTLY USED TO PERFORM STATIC IMAGING OF FIXED SPECIMENS.

THE CORE HAS BEEN SUPPORTING HIGH- IMPACT RESEARCH COVERING DIVERSE HEALTH- AND LIFE-SCIENCE FOCUSED AREAS INCLUDING IMMUNOLOGY, MICROBIOLOGY & HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTION, CELLULAR & CANCER BIOLOGY, GENETIC & ASSOCIATED DISEASES, NEUROBIOLOGY & NEUROLOGIC DISEASES, MICROBIOME, DEVELOPMENTAL & RESTORATIVE BIOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL & POPULATIONAL BIOLOGY, NUTRITIONAL BIOLOGY, AND AGING. THE GENOMICS CORE HAS ITERATED THROUGH SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF SEQUENCERS OVER THE YEARS. CURRENTLY, IT OFFERS ITS NGS SERVICES WITH SEVERAL ILLUMINA INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING A HISEQ2500, A NEXTSEQ 550, AND TWO MISEQS. ILLUMINA HAS ISSUED AN END-OF-LIFE BULLETIN AND WILL CEASE ITS SUPPORT OF THE HISEQ INSTRUMENT IN EARLY 2023. THE END-OF-LIFE WILL RENDER IT OBSOLETE AND RESULT IN A SEVERE SERVICE GAP FOR PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE THE HIGH DATA YIELD THAT THE HISEQ PROVIDES. THUS, THERE IS A DIRE NEED FOR A REPLACEMENT SEQUENCER TO PREVENT AN INTERRUPTION TO THE ONGOING RESEARCH OF OUR NIH-FUNDED INVESTIGATORS. DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL CHOICE OF A HISEQ REPLACEMENT REQUIRES CONSIDERING THE SEQUENCING NEEDS OF ONGOING AND FUTURE RESEARCH PROJECTS, THE CURRENT ARRAY OF INSTRUMENTATION, TUGC EXPERTISE, THE FUTURE GROWTH OF THE FACILITY, AND NEW APPLICATIONS. FOR THESE REASONS, THE ILLUMINA NOVASEQ 6000 IS THE MOST LOGICAL CHOICE. IT IS THE LATEST MODEL SUCCEEDING THE HISEQ 1000/2000/3000/4000 SERIES AND HAS BECOME THE LEADING CHOICE FOR HIGH OUTPUT INSTRUMENTATION. IT SUPPORTS VARIOUS READ LENGTHS OF UP TO 250 BASES AND OFFERS FOUR CHOICES OF FLOW CELLS THAT CATER TO A RANGE OF DATA YIELD REQUIREMENTS. WITH A 24- TO 48-HOUR OUTPUT CAPACITY RANGING FROM 65 BILLION TO 6 TRILLION BASES AND 650 MILLION READS TO 40 BILLION READS, IT PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY, SCALABILITY, SPEED, AND COST EFFECTIVENESS REQUIRED IN A MULTI- USER ENVIRONMENT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1365968e-88a8-9046-4733-6ec9e7f54826-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD032203_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151590515, "Award ID": "S10OD032202", "Award Amount": 600000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-26", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "BRUKER AV-NEO CONSOLE FOR 7T MRI - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THIS APPLICATION REQUESTS PARTIAL FUNDING FOR A NEW MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MR) IMAGING/SPECTROMETER CONSOLE (BRUKER AV NEO), TO REPLACE AND UPGRADE OUR CURRENT CONSOLE ON THE 7T/30 CM BORE MR SYSTEM (PURCHASED 20 YEARS AGO WITH A SHARED INSTRUMENTATION GRANT).

PURCHASING A NEW CONSOLE WILL RESULT IN: BETTER QUALITY, HIGHER SPATIAL RESOLUTION, FASTER IMAGING (LESS RISK TO VALUABLE ANESTHETIZED MICE), THE CAPABILITY OF DOING MANY NEW EXPERIMENTS (I.E., NEW MR SEQUENCES, THAT ARE NOT FEASIBLE ON THE OLD SPECTROMETER), AND INCREASED CONFIDENCE BY THE USER GROUP THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO PLAN AND PERFORM LONGITUDINAL EXPERIMENTS SINCE SERVICE AND PARTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM THE VENDOR FOR THE NEW CONSOLE. CURRENTLY, MOST OF OUR USERS PREFER TO USE THE 9.4T MR SYSTEM WITH A STATE-OF-THE ART CONSOLE, WHICH IS OUR GOAL FOR THE 7T SYSTEM. THE 7T SYSTEM HOWEVER, IS CRITICAL FOR MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING (MSK) SCIENTISTS BECAUSE IT IS A COMBINED MR-PET INSTRUMENT, PROVIDING MSK\u2019S ONLY PRECLINICAL SIMULTANEOUS DUAL MODAL MR AND PET IMAGING CAPABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE DONE ON THE 9.4T SYSTEM BECAUSE OF A SMALLER BORE SIZE. THE LARGE BORE SIZE OF THE 7T ALSO ALLOWS US TO IMAGE MULTIPLE MICE (4) SIMULTANEOUSLY WHILE ALSO DOING PET STUDIES. THIS UNIQUE CAPABILITY IS RELIED UPON BY 8 MAJOR USERS AND 2 MINOR USERS FOR MR-PET STUDIES (10 GRANTS), AND 3 MAJOR USERS (SUPPORTED BY 7 GRANTS) FOR SIMULTANEOUS MULTIPLE MOUSE IMAGING. THE METABOLISM GROUP (2 USERS, 3 GRANTS) AND TWO NEURO IMAGING GROUPS (2 USERS, 3 GRANTS) ALSO RELY ON THE 7T BECAUSE OF THE PLETHORA OF DATA ACCUMULATED UPON WHICH FUTURE STUDIES ARE PREDICATED, SO SWITCHING TO THE 9.4T IS NOT FEASIBLE. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO SOMEWHAT UNIQUE IN THAT WE ALLOW INVESTIGATORS FROM OUTSIDE MSK TO USE OUR SYSTEM, USING APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID SPREADING INFECTIONS TO DIFFERENT ANIMAL COLONIES. INVESTIGATORS FROM AT LEAST 5 INSTITUTIONS IN MANHATTAN HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND USED THE 7T/30 CM SYSTEM. AT MSK, ALMOST ALL RESEARCH FOCUSES ON CANCER BIOLOGY \u2013 HOW TO PREVENT, DETECT, UNDERSTAND, AND TREAT CANCER, AND ALL THE STUDIES (EXCEPT 1) SUPPORTING THIS APPLICATION, ARE CANCER FOCUSED. OUR LONG TERM OBJECTIVES ARE TO SUPPORT THESE NUMEROUS INVESTIGATORS (26 GRANTS, 16 INVESTIGATORS), AND PROVIDE THEM STATE OF THE ART SPATIAL AND METABOLIC IMAGING TO SUPPORT THEIR INVESTIGATIONS OF NOVEL DRUGS AND TREATMENTS TO TREAT HIGHLY MALIGNANT CANCERS AND ENHANCE OUTCOME AND CANCER CARE. SPECIFICALLY, WE SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF EXPERIMENTS WITH NOVEL ANTI- CANCER THERAPEUTICS FOCUSING ON ENHANCING THEIR CURRENT CAPABILITIES AND TESTING NOVEL APPROACHES TO CANCER CARE.

FIRST, THERE ARE TWO ZEISS 7-SERIES CONFOCAL MICROSCOPES (LSM 710 AND 700) IN THE CELLULAR IMAGING CORE THAT ARE OVER 10 YEARS OLD, TECHNICALLY OUTDATED, AND NEAR THE END OF THEIR SERVICEABLE LIFE; ZEISS WILL CEASE TO OFFER SERVICE CONTRACTS FOR THEM WITHIN 2 YEARS. SECOND, THE LSM 700 ONLY HAS 2 CHANNELS, UTILIZES OUTMODED DETECTION TECHNOLOGY, AND IS MECHANICALLY VERY SLOW. THIRD, THE LSM 710 HAS BECOME UNRELIABLE AND NONFUNCTIONAL TIME HAS INCREASED CONSIDERABLY. AFTER A SERIES OF TOTAL BREAK DOWNS OF THE LSM 710, WHICH THREATENED ONGOING RESEARCH PROJECTS, WE WERE ABLE TO GARNER INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT TO ACQUIRE A LEICA STELLARIS 5 CONFOCAL; INSTALLED IN DECEMBER 2020.

THERE IS AN URGENCY TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINS AND CONSEQUENCES OF METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION, WHICH IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF MANY DISEASES, INCLUDING DIABETES, OBESITY, CARDIOVASCULAR, IMMUNOLOGICAL, AND NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES. ALTERATIONS IN BODY COMPOSITION, SYSTEMIC THERMOGENESIS, METABOLIC RATE, MACRONUTRIENT UTILIZATION, FOOD INTAKE, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY UNDERPINS HOMEOSTATIC AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL METABOLIC STATES. CURRENT BWH METABOLIC CORE RESEARCHERS WHO UTILIZE THE CLAMS AND OTHER CORE SERVICES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED MECHANISMS OF METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION IN A VARIETY OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED MOUSE MODELS, IN RESPONSE TO DIETARY INTERVENTIONS AND IN A BROAD SPECTRUM OF RESEARCH FIELDS, INCLUDING IMMUNOLOGY, CARDIOLOGY, GASTROENTEROLOGY, AND ENDOCRINOLOGY. THE USE OF THE ECHOMRI IS JUST AS EQUALLY NEEDED FOR THE NUMEROUS INVESTIGATORS THAT REQUIRE BODY COMPOSITION ANALYSIS TO INTERPRET DATA RELATED TO ADIPOSITY AND LEAN MASS.  THE CLAMS IS THE GOLD STANDARD IN METABOLIC RESEARCH FOR ASSESSING SYSTEMIC METABOLISM; HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT ANALYTICAL CHALLENGE TO THE INTERPRETATION OF CLAMS DATA IS AN APPROPRIATE NORMALIZATION FOR BODY WEIGHT. THE CONTRIBUTION OF FAT MASS VERSUS LEAN MASS TO THERMOGENESIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT; THEREFORE, INCLUDING A HIGHLY VARIABLE FAT MASS WHEN NORMALIZING A MASS-DEPENDENT METABOLIC PARAMETER TO WHOLE BODY WEIGHT CAN CONFOUND ESTIMATES OF THERMOGENESIS. THIS APPROACH HAS LED TO THE MISIDENTIFICATION OF ABERRANT METABOLIC PHENOTYPES. THE METABOLIC FIELD IS MAKING A SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE NECESSITY OF NORMALIZING METABOLIC PARAMETERS TO LEAN MASS AND ACCOUNT FOR FAT MASS. THE ECHOMRI MEASURES PRECISE BODY COMPOSITION OF FAT, LEAN, FREE WATER, AND TOTAL WATER MASSES IN A RAPID, NON- INVASIVE MANNER AND CAN MEASURE ORGANS AND TISSUE SAMPLES OF UP TO 7 GRAMS AND BIOPSY SAMPLES OF UP TO 0.3 GRAMS.

THE CHOICE OF SURROGATE BIOMARKERS IS OFTEN LIMITED BY THE LIMITED SAMPLE VOLUME OBTAINABLE FROM SUBJECTS AND BY THE INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MEASURING MANY DIFFERENT BIOMARKERS ONE AT A TIME. THE LONG-STANDING GOAL OF THE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH CLINICAL RESEARCH CORE LABORATORY (ICTR CRCL) HAS BEEN TO SUPPORT RESEARCH PROTOCOLS THROUGH MEASURING LEVELS OF SURROGATE MARKERS IN STUDY PARTICIPANT SAMPLES (BLOOD, SERUM, PLASMA, URINE, SALIVA, CEREBROSPINAL FLUID). THE ICTR CRCL HAS PERFORMED ANALYSES FOR CLINICAL RESEARCH OCCURRING AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE, NURSING, AND PUBLIC HEALTH, AS WELL AS AT OTHER REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AND THE CLINICAL CENTER AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. BIOMARKERS HAVE EVOLVED FROM SINGLE MEASURE IN A SAMPLE ALIQUOT TO MANY MEASURES IN A SINGLE SAMPLE ALIQUOT. THESE MULTIPLEXED ASSAYS ARE COMPRISED OF PANELS OF BIOMARKERS THAT CAN REPORT ON THE STATUS OF NUMEROUS COMPONENTS IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND PATHWAYS SUCH AS IMMUNE RESPONSES (THE BALANCE OF PRO- VERSUS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUNDS) AND VASCULAR/CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEMS (HEALTH VERSUS ACUTE OR CHRONIC DYSREGULATION).

THIS INNOVATIVE GRADIENT COIL, THE \"IMPULSE\", WAS DESIGNED EXCLUSIVELY FOR 7T BY SIEMENS WITH INPUT FROM MARTINOS INVESTIGATORS, AND HAS OVERCOME THE PERFORMANCE LIMITS OF PREVIOUS-GENERATION GRADIENT COILS. IT IS CURRENTLY IN USE ONLY AT ONE 7T SITE (UC BERKELEY).  THE KEY ADVANTAGE PROVIDED BY THIS GRADIENT COIL\u2019S ADDED PERFORMANCE IS FASTER IMAGE ENCODING FOR BRAIN IMAGING. THIS CAN BE UTILIZED TO IMPROVE IMAGE QUALITY IN MANY TECHNIQUES, IN PARTICULAR ECHO PLANAR IMAGING (EPI), WHICH IS THE WORKHORSE METHOD FOR FUNCTIONAL IMAGING STUDIES AS WELL AS DIFFUSION, AND PERFUSION MR IMAGING. THE HIGHER PERFORMANCE WILL HELP REDUCE ARTIFACTS SUCH AS DISTORTION AND BLURRING, WHICH ARE PRESENT IN EPI AT THESE HIGHER MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTHS, AND THEREBY ENHANCE DATA QUALITY FOR A BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS. THE FASTER IMAGING SPEEDS CAN ALSO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY ENCODING FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION FUNCTIONAL MRI (FMRI) WITHIN THE LIMITED TIME-WINDOW AFFORDED BY T2* SIGNAL DECAY. ALTHOUGH 7T PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL BOOST IN FMRI SENSITIVITY, AND MOUNTING EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE INTRINSIC BIOLOGICAL RESOLUTION OF FMRI IS WELL BELOW THE MILLIMETER SCALE, EXISTING HARDWARE PLATFORMS CANNOT ACHIEVE THE IMAGING RESOLUTION DESIRED FOR MANY EXPERIMENTS\u2014THUS TODAY, 7T FMRI IS KNOWN TO BE \u201cENCODING LIMITED\u201d. THIS GRADIENT COIL WILL HELP SURPASS THESE ENCODING LIMITS TO HELP REAP THE FULL POTENTIAL OF 7T FMRI.

THE PRIMARY NEED FOR THIS REPLACEMENT NMR CONSOLE IS TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEED FOR NMR DATA COLLECTION AT 800 MHZ AMONG A BROAD AND GROWING USER GROUP AT RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE (RPI), AND AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN THE UPSTATE NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY REGION. THIS NMR SPECTROMETER SYSTEM WILL REPLACE A 15-YR OLD BRUKER AVANCE II (AVII) 600 MHZ NMR CONSOLE, CRYOPROBE, AND MAGNET PUMP CONTROLLER SYSTEM THAT ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY THE MANUFACTURER, AND WHICH HAVE LIMITED CAPABILITIES TO CARRY OUT MODERN NMR EXPERIMENTS REQUIRED BY OUR GROWING NIH-FUNDED NMR USER COMMUNITY. THE REPLACEMENT RF CONSOLE AND PROBE, TOGETHER WITH AN EXISTING WELL-MAINTAINED ACTIVELY-SHIELDED 18.8 TESLA SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET WITH US2 CRYOSTAT, WILL FORM AN INTEGRATED BIOMOLECULAR NMR SYSTEM. THIS PROPOSAL WAS PREPARED ON BEHALF OF SOME 21 RESEARCH GROUPS, INCLUDING 14 NIH-FUNDED GROUPS, THAT WILL UTILIZE THE PROPOSED NMR INSTRUMENT FOR MEASUREMENTS. THIS EXISTING AV II CONSOLE CANNOT BE SUSTAINABLY MAINTAINED DUE TO LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF REPLACEMENT PARTS, AND ITS INABILITY TO RUN MODERN NMR DATA COLLECTION SOFTWARE.

PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT CRYOGENIC-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (CRYO-EM) COMBINED WITH SINGLE PARTICLE ANALYSIS (SPA) HAVE FOREVER CHANGED LIFE-SCIENCE RESEARCH. UNDOUBTEDLY, WE HAVE ENTERED THE POST-CRYSTALLOGRAPHY ERA OF STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY. HOWEVER, A DRAWBACK OF CRYO-EM THAT LIMITS ITS APPLICABILITY IS THE COST OF THE INSTRUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR HIGH- RESOLUTION DATA COLLECTION. A STATE-OF-THE-ART KRIOS 300 KV ELECTRON MICROSCOPE IS AROUND 5-7 MILLION USD THAT QUICKLY REACHES AND OFTEN EXCEEDS 10 MILLION USD WITH ADDED COSTS FOR RENOVATION, SERVICE CONTRACT, AND SUPPORTIVE STAFF. THIS IS NOT ONLY UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY UNIVERSITIES BUT ALSO INSUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH CRYO-EM AS A ROUTINE METHODOLOGY TO STUDY BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES. A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE CRYO-EM SPA PIPELINE IS SPENT SCREENING SPECIMENS, WHICH INCLUDES IDENTIFYING VITRIFICATION CONDITIONS AND IMAGING GRIDS. SUCH AN ESSENTIAL YET TIME-CONSUMING PREP-WORK CAN BE ACHIEVED EFFECTIVELY AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE EFFICIENTLY ON LESS- POWERFUL 200 KV MICROSCOPES THAT ARE EASIER TO MAINTAIN AND CAN BE OPERATED BY NON-EXPERIENCED USERS.  THEREFORE, AS PART OF A COST-SHARING PLAN TO ESTABLISH A STATE-OF-THE-ART CENTER FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AT THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY (TJU), WE REQUEST FUNDS TO PURCHASE A THERMO SCIENTIFIC\u2122 GLACIOS\u2122 CRYO- TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (CRYO-TEM) EQUIPPED WITH FALCON 4 DIRECT ELECTRON DETECTOR. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A GROUP OF 11 MAJOR CORE USERS FROM BOTH INSIDE TJU AND IN NEARBY INSTITUTIONS WHO EAGERLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. AS PROOF OF COMMITMENT TO ESTABLISH CRYO-EM AT TJU, THE PROVOST, DR. MARK TYKOCINSKI HAS AGREED TO LEASE THE GLACIOS AT ZERO MONEY DOWN FOR 12 MONTHS WITH NO OBLIGATION TO BUY THE INSTRUMENT. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE 12 MONTHS, THE UNIVERSITY CAN TERMINATE THE LEASE AND RETURN THE MICROSCOPE OR EXTEND THE LEASE BY MAKING THREE ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS OR PURCHASE THE EQUIPMENT FOR CASH AT THE FAIR MARKET VALUE. THE UNIVERSITY HAS ALSO COMMITTED TO INFUSING ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT A YEARLY SERVICE CONTRACT, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE FEES, AND SUPPORT A RECENTLY RECRUITED CRYO-EM MANAGER.

CURRENTLY, THE LMC OPERATES TWO CONFOCAL MICROSCOPES, ZEISS LSM510 NLO AND ZEISS LSM710 (PURCHASED IN 2004 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY), BOTH OF WHICH HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASING MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND DOWNTIME, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL INCONVENIENCES AND DELAYS IN NUMEROUS RESEARCH PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY, THESE OLDER INSTRUMENTS HAVE TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS IN SPEED, SENSITIVITY, RESOLUTION, AND VERSATILITY. THE NIH-FUNDED INVESTIGATORS AT UC HAVE A STRONG NEED FOR ADVANCED LIVE IMAGING CAPABILITIES, AND REQUIRE INSTRUMENTATION TO: 1) PERFORM LONG TIME LAPSE FLUORESCENCE IMAGING EXPERIMENTS IN LIVE CELLS, TISSUES, AND 3D ORGANOID CULTURES, 2) COLLECT 3D FLUORESCENCE IMAGES WITH SUFFICIENT RESOLUTION TO LOCALIZE PROTEINS AND STRUCTURES OF INTEREST IN STAINED CELLS, TISSUES, AND ORGANOIDS, AND 3) SIMULTANEOUSLY DETECT NUMEROUS FLUORESCENT MARKERS WITH EFFICIENT SPECTRAL SEPARATION.  TO MITIGATE THIS CRITICAL NEED, THIS APPLICATION REQUESTS FUNDS TO ACQUIRE AN ADVANCED CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE SYSTEM, THE LEICA STELLARIS 8, TO SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING MICROSCOPES IN THE LMC. THIS NEW INSTRUMENT WILL SERVE TWO MAJOR PURPOSES: ADD CAPACITY TO OUR CURRENTLY OVER-UTILIZED CONFOCAL SYSTEMS, AND ENABLE NEW IMAGING EXPERIMENTS THAT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITH THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY. SPECIFICALLY, THIS NEW MICROSCOPE WILL GREATLY IMPROVE THE VIABILITY OF SAMPLES FOR LONG TIME LAPSE IMAGING, ENHANCE RESOLUTION AND SENSITIVITY TO DETECT SMALL SUBCELLULAR DETAILS, AND IMPROVE IMAGING SPEED FOR EFFICIENT COLLECTION OF LARGE 3D DATA SETS AND CAPTURING FAST DYNAMIC PROCESSES IN LIVE SAMPLES. THE LEICA STELLARIS 8 SYSTEM WILL BE INSTALLED WITHIN THE CURRENT CENTRAL IMAGING FACILITY AND WILL BE OPERATED BY THE FACILITY TECHNICIAN WITH 15 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN ALL ASPECTS OF CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY EXPERIMENTATION AND ANALYSIS. THIS APPLICATION IS SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST, NEED, AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT AT THE UNIVERSITY, AND WILL SERVE A LARGE NIH-FUNDED SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. WE HAVE SECURED FUNDING GUARANTEES FROM THE COM AND UC OFFICE OF RESEARCH TO ENSURE THE INSTRUMENT IS COVERED UNDER SERVICE CONTRACT AT ALL TIMES, AND A FINANCIAL PLAN WITH BACKUP DEPARTMENTAL FUNDS FOR ONGOING OPERATIONAL AND PERSONNEL COSTS TO OPERATE THE MICROSCOPE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.

TO STUDY MECHANOBIOLOGY AT THE MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND TISSUE LEVELS, RESEARCHERS NEED A TOOL THAT CAN MEASURE AND CONTROL THE MECHANICS OF SAMPLES WHILE MONITORING BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE SAMPLES. THE INSTRUMENT REQUESTED IN THIS PROPOSAL IS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT POSITIONS AN ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE (AFM) ON TOP OF A FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPE, PROVIDING UNIQUE CAPABILITIES TO PRECISELY MEASURE AND APPLY FORCES AND SIMULTANEOUSLY VISUALIZE BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA. THE AFM PLATFORM OFFERS FORCE MEASUREMENTS, HIGH-RESOLUTION MECHANICAL PROPERTY MAPPING, VIDEO- RATE IMAGING, AND A NANO-FLUIDICS INTEGRATED PROBE SYSTEM. THE FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPE INCLUDES A SPINNING DISK CONFOCAL, TOTAL INTERNAL -REFLECTION FLUORESCENCE (TIRF), AND DIFFERENTIAL INTERFERENCE CONTRAST (DIC).

THE PROTEOMICS SLR IS EQUIPPED WITH TWO LC-MS/MS SYSTEMS INCLUDING AN EIGHT YEAR OLD THERMOSCIENTIFIC ORBITRAP ELITE AND A THREE YEAR OLD THERMOSCIENTIFIC FUSION LUMOS SYSTEM. THE PROTEOMICS SLR IS CURRENTLY RUNNING AT CAPACITY, WITH OVER 45% OF THE CURRENT EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMIC PROJECTS. THE CURRENT WORKLOAD OF THE PROTEOMICS SLR HAS RESULTED IN LONG WAIT TIMES FOR PROTEOMIC EXPERIMENTS THAT INVOLVE THE ANALYSIS OF MORE THAN 20 SAMPLES. THE LARGE WORKLOAD AND SUBSEQUENT WAIT TIMES ARE EXASPERATED BY THE LOW THROUGHPUT WORKFLOW OF THE ELITE AND LUMOS INSTRUMENTS, EACH INSTRUMENT ANALYZING APPROXIMATELY 8 SAMPLES PER DAY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TWOFOLD AND INCLUDES INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF THE PROTEOMICS SLR AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE SLR TO INCLUDE HIGH THROUGHPUT PROTEOMIC EXPERIMENTS. THE TIMSTOF PRO INSTRUMENT IS A FAST SCANNING QUADRUPOLE TIME OF FLIGHT INSTRUMENT AND WAS SELECTED FOR THIS PROPOSAL BASED ON DATA THAT INDICATES THAT THIS INSTRUMENT CAN ANALYZE BETWEEN 40-100 SAMPLES PER DAY WITHOUT SACRIFICING PROTEOME DEPTH, SENSITIVITY, ACCURACY AND ROBUSTNESS. A COMPARISON OF A DIA BASED PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS OF A TRYPTIC DIGEST GENERATED FROM A CELL LYSATE ON THE LUMOS HOUSED IN THE PROTEOMICS SLR AND THE TIMSTOF PRO INSTRUMENT SHOWED THAT THE TIMSTOF PRO QUANTIFIED MORE PROTEINS IN A 30 MINUTE GRADIENT (OVER 4800) COMPARED TO A 90 MINUTE GRADIENT ON THE LUMOS INSTRUMENT (3000). THIS INCREASED PROTEOME DEPTH IS DUE TO THE HIGHER SCAN RATES, 100 HZ, OF THE TIMSTOF PRO, ALONG WITH AN ADDITIONAL DIMENSION OF SEPARATION (ION MOBILITY), AND THE CAPABILITY OF THIS INSTRUMENT TO PERFORM PARALLEL ACCUMULATION SERIAL FRAGMENTATION (PASEF) WHICH ALLOWS SYNCHRONIZATION OF THE QUADRUPOLE MASS FILTER WITH THE TIMS ION MOBILITY CELL.

IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE AN EMERGING FIELD OF RESEARCH AND OVERCOME SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT TOOLS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THEREFORE, THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN HAVE A BROAD IMPACT ON BOTH BASIC RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE. BEYOND DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING INFECTIONS, THESE TECHNOLOGIES WILL ALSO PROVIDE A UNIFORM CROSS-SPECIES PLATFORM FOR ANIMAL STUDIES, ALLOW UNIQUE INSIGHTS INTO UNDERSTANDING DISEASE PATHOGENESIS AND EXPEDITE BENCH-TO-BEDSIDE TRANSLATION OF NEW THERAPEUTICS.

THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS IN X-RAY DIFFRACTOMETER TECHNOLOGY SINCE THE PRIOR ACQUISITION (2012) OF THE CURRENT DIFFRACTOMETER HOUSED IN CHEMISTRY AT JHU, AND THESE ADVANCES ALLOW FOR A MAJOR LEAP FORWARD IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CHALLENGING CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS. SUCH MATERIALS ARE: (I) COMPOUNDS THAT DO NOT CRYSTALLIZE WELL AND/OR GROW WITH ONLY VERY SMALL CRYSTAL DIMENSIONS (E.G. 10-40 \u039cM), (II) HIGH VALUE CHEMICAL TARGET MOLECULES (E.G., INTERMEDIATE SPECIES, NOVEL METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS, SUPRAMOLECULAR ASSEMBLIES) THAT HAVE LIMITING DIFFRACTION POWER DUE TO POOR LONG-RANGE ORDER, AND/OR CONTAIN LARGE AMOUNTS OF SOLVENT INCLUSION, AND (III) PROTEINS WITH RELATIVELY LONG UNIT CELL DIMENSIONS (> 150 \u00c5). THESE MATERIALS WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, OR IMPOSSIBLE, TO CHARACTERIZE WITH THE CURRENT INSTRUMENTATION AT JHU.

SPECIFICALLY, THE REQUEST IS FOR THE ONEMP MODEL OF MASS PHOTOMETER MANUFACTURED BY REFEYN LTD. MASS PHOTOMETRY (MP) IS A RELATIVELY NEW METHOD THAT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO OUR USER BASE. IT USES THE SCATTERING OF LIGHT AS MACROMOLECULES ADHERE TO AT A WATER/GLASS INTERFACE (I.E. ON A STANDARD COVER SLIP) TO MEASURE THEIR RESPECTIVE MOLECULAR MASSES. IT DOES THIS BY RECOMBINING THE SCATTERED LIGHT WITH LIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE INTERFACE. THE RESULTING IMAGES ARE PROCESSED TO REVEAL THE CONTRAST IN THEM AS A FUNCTION OF TIME; THE CONTRAST CAN IN TURN BE RELATED DIRECTLY TO THE MOLECULAR MASS OF THE ADHERENCE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE TO IT. MP YIELDS REMARKABLY ACCURATE MOLECULAR MASS DISTRIBUTIONS, AND IT DOES SO WITHOUT LABELING, IMMOBILIZATION, OR INTERACTION WITH A MATRIX. MP USES VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL, CONSUMING ONLY TENS OF PICOGRAMS PER EXPERIMENT. IT IS ALSO VERY FAST, AS AN OPTIMIZED EXPERIMENT CAN BE PERFORMED IN 15 MIN OR LESS. UTSW HAS A VIGOROUS PROGRAM OF MOLECULAR RESEARCH, AND THE MP FILLS A NEED FOR MANY OF OUR SCIENTISTS. SOME WILL INCORPORATE THE MP INTO A WORKFLOW THAT WILL GREATLY AMPLIFY SPEED AND EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH THEY CAN PRODUCE STRUCTURAL DATA. FOR SOME OF THESE RESEARCHERS, THE LOW SAMPLE CONSUMPTION AND ACCURATE MASS-DISTRIBUTION QUANTIFICATION OF THE METHOD WILL OPEN AVENUES OF CHARACTERIZATION HERETOFORE UNAVAILABLE TO THEM.

THE GROUP HAS A STRONG SYNERGISTIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF NEW ANALYTICAL TOOL DEVELOPMENT THAT IS IMMEDIATELY USED TO ANSWER CRITICAL QUESTIONS ON CANCER DISPARITIES, PROGNOSIS OR DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER, IMMUNE RESPONSE, OXIDATIVE STRESS IMBALANCE, METABOLIC DEREGULATION, PROTEIN MISFOLDING, SPHINGOSINE TRAFFICKING, REACTIVE STROMA, AND MARKERS OF TRANSPLANT FAILURE. IMPORTANTLY, THIS WORK IS PRIMARILY DONE ON HUMAN TISSUES, SO THAT IT IS IMMEDIATELY APPLICABLE TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING HUMAN DISEASE RESEARCH AND CAN BE APPLIED TO CLINICAL TRIALS. THE CURRENT FT-ICR INSTRUMENT WAS INSTALLED IN 2012 AND RUNS AT CAPACITY 24/7. THIS INSTRUMENT IS AGING AND HAS SIGNIFICANT DOWNTIME FOR REPAIRS. THE NEW INSTRUMENT WILL ALLOW OUR INVESTIGATORS TO JUMP FORWARD TO STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY WITH 1) INCREASED ACQUISITION SPEEDS, 2) INCREASED SENSITIVITY, 3) INCREASED MASS RESOLVING POWER, AND 4) MULTIPLE FRAGMENTATION CAPABILITIES THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY COUPLED TO IDENTIFICATION STRATEGIES FOR IMAGING WORKFLOWS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE SCIMAX MAGNETIC RESONANCE MASS SPECTROMETER AS THE FT-ICR IMAGING MASS SPECTROMETER THAT WILL BEST SUIT THE NEEDS OF OUR RESEARCH GROUP. OUR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT IS STRONG AND OUR GROUP HAS COMBINED DECADES OF EXPERTISE IN BIOMEDICAL STUDIES BY FT-ICR.

RECENT ADVANCES IN CULTURING ORGANOIDS OR 3D TISSUE DERIVED FROM PATIENT OR PROGENITOR CELLS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEETING THIS CHALLENGE. IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT DRUG DISCOVERY USING SUCH IN VITRO MODELS REPRESENTS AN ACCELERATED ROUTE TO PRE-CLINICAL TESTING OF DRUG CANDIDATES BECAUSE ORGANOIDS AND 3D STRUCTURES MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE THE COMPLEX PHYSIOPATHOLOGY OF DISEASED TISSUE THAN CULTURED CELL LINES OR BIOCHEMICAL ASSAYS. AN ONGOING CHALLENGE IN THE FIELD IS THE UPGRADING OF INSTRUMENTATION, TECHNOLOGY, AND METHODS TO VISUALIZE AND MEASURE COMPONENTS AND FEATURES (PHENOTYPES) IN RESPONSES TO MOLECULAR TREATMENT WITHIN THESE 3D MODELS.

THE CURRENT SYSTEM WAS PURCHASED IN 2008 THROUGH FUNDING FROM THE NIH'S MOLECULAR LIBRARY SCREENING CENTER NETWORK (MLSCN) AND HAS SINCE PROVIDED COMPOUND MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO VANDERBILT INVESTIGATORS PERFORMING CHEMICAL BIOLOGY RESEARCH. THE UNISTORE IS A CORNERSTONE OF THE VANDERBILT HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING (VHTS) CORE PROVIDING A LONG-TERM STORAGE ENVIRONMENT, RAPID RETRIEVAL, AND TRACKING MECHANISM FOR EACH COMPOUND SAMPLE, WHETHER IN A TUBE OR MULTI-WELL PLATE. THIS HAS ENABLED OUR INSTITUTION TO OPERATE ON PAR WITH BIOTECH AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES IN TERMS OF QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS. THE VHTS UNISTORE HOLDS APPROXIMATELY 200,000 0.7ML TUBES, 2,500 4-ML VIALS, AND 7,000 384-WELL PLATES - TOTALING OVER 2.5 MILLION SAMPLES. THESE SAMPLES ARE CATEGORIZED AS LARGE, CHEMICALLY DIVERSE SCREENING COLLECTIONS, LIBRARIES OF KNOWN BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS, AND PROJECT-SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS. THE FORMER TWO REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF THE SAMPLES AND ARE AVAILABLE TO ANY VANDERBILT RESEARCHER AS A FEE-FOR-SERVICE DISTRIBUTION. THIS SERVICE DOVETAILS TO THE HTS SCREENING SERVICES THAT SPAN EARLY DISCOVERY (E.G. TOOL COMPOUND DISCOVERY) AND TRANSLATIONAL (E.G. DISCOVERY OF NEW CLINICALLY-RELEVANT ACTIVITY OF KNOWN DRUGS) PROJECTS. THE THIRD CATEGORY (PROJECT-SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS) ARE COMPOUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC, INVESTIGATOR-DRIVEN HITS-TO-LEADS AND LEAD OPTIMIZATION PRECLINICAL DRUG DISCOVERY PROJECTS.

THE FACT THAT THE ELECTRIC FIELD IS INDUCED BY A TIME-VARYING MAGNETIC FIELD ENABLES THE STIMULATION TO PENETRATE THE SKULL EFFICIENTLY, SAFELY, AND PAINLESSLY. THEREFORE, TMS HAS BECOME HIGHLY POPULAR FOR BOTH BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS SUCH AS TREATMENT OF DRUG-RESISTANT DEPRESSION. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE TMS-INDUCED BRAIN ACTIVATIONS PROPAGATE FROM THE PRIMARY TARGET AREA TO THE SECONDARY AREAS THAT ARE ANATOMICALLY CONNECTED TO IT, GENERATING A NETWORK-LEVEL RESPONSE. THIS OBSERVATION HAS IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES FOR UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF THE STIMULATION. FIRST, THE PRIMARY TARGET LOCATION MUST BE DEFINED WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL ANATOMY AND THE STIMULATION LOCATION MAINTAINED CONSISTENTLY. SECOND, NEUROIMAGING METHODS ARE NEEDED TO RECORD HOW THE BRAIN NETWORKS RESPOND TO THE STIMULATION.  TMS NEURONAVIGATION SYSTEMS HAVE RAPIDLY GAINED POPULARITY IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACCURATE FRAMELESS STEREOTACTIC SYSTEMS UTILIZING SUBJECT-SPECIFIC MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) DATA TO DEFINE STIMULATION TARGETS. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN ACCURATE MANUAL COIL POSITIONING UNDER MRI GUIDED NEURONAVIGATION, FOR MORE COMPLEX EXPERIMENTS THIS MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT OPERATOR FATIGUE DUE TO HOLDING THE BULKY TMS COIL IN A FIXED POSITION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME RESULTING IN UNWANTED VARIABILITY IN THE SPATIAL TARGETING OF THE STIMULATION. MECHANICAL COIL HOLDERS CAN BE EMPLOYED TO MITIGATE THE OPERATOR FATIGUE, BUT ANY MOVEMENT OF THE SUBJECT\u2019S HEAD WILL REQUIRE A TIME-CONSUMING REPOSITIONING OF THE HOLDER DEVICE. ROBOTIC POSITIONING OF THE TMS COIL IS ARGUABLY THE MOST ACCURATE AND EFFICIENT METHOD FOR RESOLVING THESE ISSUES, BUT THE INSTRUMENTATION IS RATHER COSTLY, AND THE SYSTEM HAS LIMITED MOBILITY/PORTABILITY DUE TO ITS LARGE SIZE. RECENTLY, COLLABORATIVE ROBOT (COBOT) TECHNOLOGY WAS INTRODUCED TO LOWER THE COST AND INCREASE THE MOBILITY OF AUTOMATIC TMS COIL POSITIONING. THE SYSTEM CAN BE PILOTED ALSO MANUALLY AND AFTER INITIAL GUIDANCE OF THE TMS COIL TO THE DESIRED TARGET BY A HUMAN OPERATOR, THE TMS COBOT WILL MAINTAIN CONSISTENT POSITIONING OF THE COIL WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY AND AUTOMATIC DETECTION/CORRECTION FOR HEAD MOTION. IN THIS PROPOSAL, THE GOAL IS TO ACQUIRE AN INSTRUMENT SYSTEM FOR NEURONAVIGATED TMS CONTROLLED WITH A COLLABORATIVE ROBOT. DUE TO ITS TRANSPORTABLE NATURE, THE SYSTEM CAN BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH NEUROIMAGING METHODS SUCH AS FUNCTIONAL MRI (FMRI), ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG), MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY (MEG), AND POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET). THE CAPABILITY OF AND COMBINING TMS WITH NEUROIMAGING TO OBSERVE AND QUANTIFY THE NEUROMODULATION EFFECTS ENABLE PARALLEL TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES ON POTENTIAL NEW THERAPEUTIC TMS APPLICATIONS AND MORE DETAILED INVESTIGATIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ACTIVATION MECHANISMS.

TO IMPROVE THE CURE RATE WITH RADIATION THERAPY AND TO DECREASE THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM SIDE EFFECTS OF RADIATION, WE HAVE RECEIVED MULTIPLE NIH GRANTS TO STUDY RADIATION BIOLOGY IN SMALL ANIMALS. DUKE UNIVERSITY WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CENTERS TO OBTAIN A FIRST GENERATION MICROCT/MICRO-IRRADIATOR FOR USE IN SMALL ANIMALS (X-RAD 225CX), WHICH HAS SUPPORTED ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY IN RADIATION THERAPY, RADIATION INJURY, AND IMAGING. MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN TARGET LOCALIZATION, TREATMENT PLANNING, AND RADIATION DELIVERY IN COMBINATION WITH FUNCTIONAL IMAGING HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THAT TIME, AND THESE CAPABILITIES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR OUR RADIATION RESEARCH TO BETTER MIMIC HUMAN RADIATION THERAPY AND THEREFORE HAVE THE MOST RELEVANCE AND IMPACT. TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL RESEARCH IN RADIATION BIOLOGY, WE REQUEST A SHARED INSTRUMENT THAT COMBINES ON-BOARD IMAGING CAPABILITIES (MICRO-CT), WITH CONFORMAL SMALL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY AND ADVANCED TREATMENT PLANNING SOFTWARE THAT IS CAPABLE OF THE SAME TREATMENT PLANNING APPROACHES AND METRICS MOST COMMONLY USED TODAY IN THE CLINIC. THIS IS INCORPORATED INTO THE XSTRAHL SMALL ANIMAL RADIATION RESEARCH PLATFORM (SARRP). THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT USES STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY FOR SMALL ANIMALS THAT RIGOROUSLY SIMULATES THE RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING AND TREATMENT CONDITIONS OF OUR PATIENTS. WE PROPOSE TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO INVESTIGATE (1) MECHANISMS OF TUMOR CONTROL AND (2) NORMAL TISSUE INJURY BY RADIATION THERAPY. WE WILL UTILIZE THE ON-BOARD IMAGING AND THE CUSTOM COLLIMATORS TO SAFELY DELIVER LARGE DOSES OF RADIATION WITH HIGH PRECISION AND ACCURACY TO DISSECT MECHANISMS OF TUMOR CONTROL. THIS APPROACH WILL ALLOW US TO STUDY THE CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL ENDPOINT OF TUMOR CURE. MOREOVER, THE ABILITY TO IMAGE SMALL ANIMALS AND LOCALIZE THE TUMOR TARGET BEFORE EACH TREATMENT WILL FACILITATE FRACTIONATED RADIATION THERAPY SCHEDULES FOR SMALL ANIMALS, WHICH ARE ROUTINELY USED TO TREAT PATIENTS IN THE CLINIC. THE INSTRUMENT WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO HAVE THE UNPRECEDENTED ABILITY TO FOCUS RADIATION THERAPY ON PART OF AN ORGAN, TO CREATE DOSE VOLUME HISTOGRAMS (DVHS) TO STUDY MECHANISMS OF NORMAL TISSUE INJURY, AND TO MODEL ADVANCED APPROACHES FOR CANCER THERAPY (E.G. SPARING LYMPH NODES FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY STUDIES). THIS APPROACH WILL AVOID MULTI-ORGAN INJURY BY THE RADIATION TREATMENT AND WILL THEREBY FACILITATE STUDIES OF RADIATION-INDUCED NORMAL TISSUE INJURY IN SMALL ANIMALS. IN SUMMARY, THIS TECHNOLOGY OFFERS A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN OUR ABILITY TO STUDY FUNDAMENTAL RADIATION BIOLOGY QUESTIONS USING THE SAME TECHNOLOGY WITH WHICH WE TREAT PATIENTS.

PMF IS A MASS SPECTROMETRY (MS)-BASED SHARED RESOURCE THAT PROVIDES THE ENTIRE UCONN RESEARCH COMMUNITY WITH INNOVATIVE AND CUSTOMIZED METHODS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF PEPTIDES, PROTEINS, AND SMALL MOLECULE METABOLITES IN ORDER TO ELUCIDATE THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE HUMAN DISEASE. SINCE OPENING 2.5 YEARS AGO, PMF HAS ALREADY PROVIDED SOPHISTICATED ANALYTICAL SERVICES TO MORE THAN 80 LABORATORIES AND MANY OF THESE HAVE MULTIPLE PROJECTS ONGOING SIMULTANEOUSLY. CURRENTLY, ALL PROTEOMICS EXPERIMENTS AT UCONN ARE ANALYZED IN PMF USING A SINGLE, REFURBISHED THERMO SCIENTIFIC Q EXACTIVE HF MASS SPECTROMETER PURCHASED IN 2015; THIS IS THE ONLY HIGH RESOLUTION ADVANCED PROTEOMICS-CAPABLE MASS SPECTROMETER AVAILABLE TO UCONN INVESTIGATORS. AS A RESULT, IT CONSISTENTLY RUNS AT FULL CAPACITY AND LACKS CRUCIAL ANALYTICAL OPTIONS REQUIRED FOR NIH-FUNDED RESEARCH. THE REQUESTED INSTRUMENTATION WILL EXCLUSIVELY PROVIDE THE SUBSTANTIAL TECHNOLOGICAL UPGRADES REQUIRED FOR HEALTH- RELATED PROJECTS FOCUSED ON ELUCIDATING THE PROTEIN CONTRIBUTIONS TO VARIOUS HUMAN DISEASES. THESE VITAL UPGRADES INCLUDE MAXIMUM SENSITIVITY FOR LOW ABUNDANCE ION DETECTION, SUPERIOR DEPTH OF PROTEOME COVERAGE FOR EVERY EXPERIMENT, NEW PEPTIDE/PROTEIN DISSOCIATION TECHNIQUES UNAVAILABLE AT UCONN, AND NOVEL METHODS TO PROVIDE THE UTMOST ACCURACY OF QUANTIFICATION FOR LABEL-BASED, MULTIPLEXED PROTEOMICS VIA REAL-TIME SEARCH SYNCHRONOUS PRECURSOR SELECTION. THESE FEATURES ARE UNIQUELY EXHIBITED ON THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENTATION AND ARE REQUIRED FOR 15 (13 NIH-FUNDED) INVESTIGATORS AT THE UCONN STORRS AND UCONN HEALTH MEDICAL RESEARCH CAMPUSES. CONVERSELY, OUR SINGLE EXISTING INSTRUMENT SUFFERS FROM POORER SENSITIVITY, LIMITED DEPTH OF COVERAGE PARTICULARLY FOR PROTEIN-LIMITED SAMPLES, TANDEM MS BY ONLY ONE PEPTIDE DISSOCIATION TECHNIQUE, AND INACCURATE QUANTIFICATION FOR LABEL-BASED, MULTIPLEXED ANALYSES. THEREFORE, ACQUISITION OF THE ORBITRAP ECLIPSE IS NECESSARY TO TRANSFORM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH FOR NIH-FUNDED PROJECTS THAT WE CANNOT CURRENTLY COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY. BY IMPLEMENTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES FEATURED ON THE ORBITRAP ECLIPSE, PMF WILL PERMIT BREAKTHROUGH RESEARCH THAT REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF SEVERELY LIMITED PROTEIN SAMPLES, FULL CHARACTERIZATION OF IMPORTANT REGULATORY POST- TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS, AND IDENTIFICATION OF NEW PROTEIN TARGETS IMPLICATED IN DISEASE USING EXTREMELY ACCURATE QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMICS. OVERALL, THESE ADVANCEMENTS WILL ALLOW NIH-FUNDED UCONN INVESTIGATORS TO DETERMINE THE UNDERLYING PROTEIN CONTRIBUTIONS TO HUMAN DISEASE AND HELP DESIGN FUTURE THERAPEUTICS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f7d4a874-2ab3-85f8-4c06-002c8728886d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD028445_7529"}, {"internal_id": 82470902, "Award ID": "S10OD027045", "Award Amount": 600000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-07-29", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH BY 3T MOLECULAR IMAGING", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fafdc950-0302-1107-c64c-74fb82b7ab42-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD027045_7529"}, {"internal_id": 86316074, "Award ID": "S10OD027043", "Award Amount": 538359.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-20", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "REQUEST OF A NIKON A1RSI CONFOCAL MICROSCOPE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3d0e924f-2881-5f66-8511-7122b17340d9-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD027043_7529"}, {"internal_id": 81395390, "Award ID": "S10OD027042", "Award Amount": 599320.36, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-06-07", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "IVIS SPECTRUM CT PRECLINICAL IN VIVO IMAGING SYSTEM", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e0af38c9-92a8-f2cb-a5b8-4b4f14f99689-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD027042_7529"}, {"internal_id": 130086658, "Award ID": "S10OD027039", "Award Amount": 2000000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-03-22", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "7T MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING SYSTEM FOR BASIC, TRANSLATIONAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH - PROJECT SUMMARY WEILL MEDICAL COLLEGE OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY (WEILL CORNELL MEDICINE, WCM) REQUESTS HIGH-END INSTRUMENTATION GRANT PROGRAM SUPPORT TO PURCHASE A STATE-OF-THE-ART HUMAN WHOLE-BODY SEVEN TESLA (7T) MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) SYSTEM AS A SPECIAL USE INSTRUMENT (SUI; PAR-19-177).

FIELD NMR SPECTROMETERS AT BOSTON COLLEGE (BC). THE MRC PRIMARILY SERVES THE FACULTY MEMBERS OF THE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT, 67% OF WHOM WORK ON PROJECTS FUNDED BY THE NIH. LIQUID STATE NMR IS BY FAR THE MOST SUITABLE EXPERIMENTAL METHOD FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, BECAUSE THE SAMPLES UNDER INVESTIGATION MOST CLOSELY MIMIC THE MOLECULES IN THEIR NATURAL STATE WITHIN OUR BODIES. HERE, FUNDS ARE REQUESTED TO PURCHASE A CRYOPROBE ENABLED AVANCE NEO 500 MHZ SPECTROMETER FROM BRUKER BIOSPIN CORPORATION. THIS SYSTEM CAN DETECT SAMPLES OF VERY LOW (NM) CONCENTRATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST SENSITIVITY, WHILE REDUCING THE ACQUISITION TIME FOR DATA COLLECTION. THE NMR SYSTEMS THAT CURRENTLY OCCUPY THE MRC WERE MANUFACTURED BY AGILENT, WHICH HAS CEASED ALL OPERATIONS IN MAGNETIC RESONANCE; THEREFORE, SUPPORT FOR THE EXISTING INSTRUMENTS WILL END IN 2021. THE 500 MHZ NEO, WITH HIGHER SENSITIVITY AND RESOLUTION, WILL REPLACE A 400 MHZ SYSTEM WITH A MAGNET THAT IS OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD. IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING THIS CRITICAL NEED, THE CRYOPROBE WILL ENHANCE SENSITIVITY OF THE NMR DATA WHILE INCREASING CAPACITY IN THE MRC DUE TO REDUCED ACQUISITION TIMES. THIS IS AN ACCESSORY THAT HAS NEVER BEEN A PART OF BC\u2019S INSTRUMENTATION REPERTOIRE. THE NEW SYSTEM WILL ALSO ENABLE THE MRC TO MAINTAIN ITS VITAL FUNCTION AT BC BY PROVIDING OUR RESEARCHERS WITH NEW CAPABILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. THE NUMEROUS NIH-FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECTS AT BC EMPHASIZE ON THE BETTERMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, FOCUSING ON BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OR NOVEL CATALYSIS METHODS THAT AID IN DRUG DESIGN. AN NMR SPECTROMETER THAT IS SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO ACQUIRE HIGH QUALITY DATA WITH LESS MATERIAL IS CRUCIAL FOR PROMOTING THE OUTCOMES OF THESE PROJECTS. THE ENHANCED CAPACITY AND SENSITIVITY OF THE NEW INSTRUMENT WILL BENEFIT ALL OF THESE NIH PROJECTS AT BC, WHICH INCLUDE STUDIES OF BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS, AND DEVELOPMENTS OF NEW BIOLOGIC THERAPEUTICS. THE NEW SYSTEM IS ALSO VERY ADEPT AT DEUTERIUM DETECTION, ENABLES FACILE ACQUISITION OF SPECTRA AT LOW TEMPERATURES, AND HAS WATER SUPPRESSION TECHNIQUES THAT ARE SUPERIOR AND MORE USER-FRIENDLY THAN EXISTING AGILENT COUNTERPARTS. ALL OF THESE ASPECTS ARE CRUCIAL TO SUPPORT ONGOING PROJECTS AT BC THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LIMITED BY THE LEGACY AGILENT SYSTEMS. THEREFORE, THIS NEW INSTRUMENT WILL PROVE TO BE AN INVALUABLE ASSET TO OUR RESEARCHERS FOR YEARS TO COME.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ca18aabd-5785-795d-5681-14919d3f26ad-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD026910_7529"}, {"internal_id": 108463583, "Award ID": "S10OD026909", "Award Amount": 1938041.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-11", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "HIGH-THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPIC SCREENING (HPS) PLATFORM FOR LARGE-SCALE DRUG DISCOVERY IN WHOLE-ORGANISM AND HUMAN ORGANOID-BASED DISEASE MODELS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD026909_7529"}, {"internal_id": 83103858, "Award ID": "S10OD026899", "Award Amount": 540801.98, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-02", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "IMAGEXPRESS MICRO (IXM) CONFOCAL HIGH-CONTENT IMAGING SYSTEM", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0c13d643-4334-38ed-1952-0db7e2ac5e56-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD026899_7529"}, {"internal_id": 98487406, "Award ID": "S10OD026896", "Award Amount": 580000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-06-25", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "MACROMOLECULAR X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DE", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "88f4772d-e0bd-42e6-ed20-c3144d3bace8-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD026896_7529"}, {"internal_id": 108463644, "Award ID": "S10OD026890", "Award Amount": 379300.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-05", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "ACQUISITION OF THE ECHO 650 LIQUID HANDLER: A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY, MULTI-LABORATORY TOOL FOR RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND EDUCATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NJ", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0c9d7554-cb59-0dff-6547-d9102319b537-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD026890_7529"}, {"internal_id": 81728697, "Award ID": "S10OD026884", "Award Amount": 681453.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-06-21", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "OPTICAL TWEEZERS WITH SCANNING CONFOCAL FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fb0c0b67-cf3f-8e71-00cf-883ce0aa9a3c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD026884_7529"}, {"internal_id": 83103506, "Award ID": "S10OD026882", "Award Amount": 1028747.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-12", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "ORBITRAP FUSION LUMOS TRIBRID MASS SPECTROMETER", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "59649428-1ebf-ef93-ea43-2491b55b3188-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_S10OD026882_7529"}, {"internal_id": 83103518, "Award ID": "S10OD026881", "Award Amount": 1845637.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-06", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "GLACIOS?

THE AIF OF THE ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE SUPPORTS NIH-FUNDED INVESTIGATORS BY GIVING THEM ACCESS TO STATE-OF-THE-ART MICROSCOPY TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENHANCE COLLABORATIVE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH. ACQUISITION OF THIS INSTRUMENT WILL HAVE A HIGH IMPACT ON THE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AT EINSTEIN AND WILL EXPAND THE SCOPE OF NIH-FUNDED PROJECTS AT EINSTEIN. SEVERAL PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT WILL HEAVILY UTILIZE THE SCANNER. THESE INCLUDE: THE STUDY OF THE FORMATION OF INVASION PROMOTING STRUCTURES USED TO SYSTEMICALLY DISSEMINATE METASTATIC CANCER CELLS IN CARCINOMA (CONDEELIS), CORRELATIVE INTRAVITAL-HISTOPATHOLOGIC IMAGING TO DISSECT THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT (ENTENBERG), ESTABLISHMENT AND VALIDATION OF AN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED RADIATION PROCTITIS MOUSE MODEL (GUHA), STUDYING THE PROMETASTATIC EFFECTS OF NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN BREAST CANCER (KARAGIANNIS), INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF TUMOR ENVIRONMENT ON METASTASIS (OKTAY), THE ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR MARKERS OF RISK OF SUBSEQUENT INVASIVE BREAST CANCER IN WOMEN WITH DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (ROHAN), AND THE STUDY OF HEPATOCYTE HETEROGENEITY WITH RESPECT TO GENE TRANSCRIPTION SIGNATURES AND THEIR ZONAL DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE INTACT LIVER IN HEALTHY TISSUE AS WELL AS DISEASED PATIENT TISSUE (SINGER).THERE ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL PROJECTS OF MINOR USERS AND MANY USERS IN THE EINSTEIN COMMUNITY ARE ANTICIPATED. ALL OF THE PROJECTS IN THIS APPLICATION ARE IN NEED OF HIGH-CAPACITY AND HIGH- REPRODUCIBILITY SCANNING SO THAT ANALYSES MAY BE APPLIED TO LARGER TISSUES, COVERING HUNDREDS OF FIELDS OF VIEW, RATHER

ALTHOUGH ADVANCED ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUMENTATION HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT TARGET GLYCANS, THERE IS STILL A GREAT NEED FOR REAGENTS WITH WELL-DEFINED CARBOHYDRATE SPECIFICITY AND HIGH AFFINITY THAT CAN BE USED TO INDEPENDENTLY INTERROGATE OR ENRICH CARBOHYDRATE SAMPLES PRIOR TO TRADITIONAL ANALYSES. LECTENZ BIO HAS BEEN ENGINEERING GLYCAN-PROCESSING ENZYMES AND GLYCAN-BINDING PROTEINS INTO HIGH-AFFINITY GLYCAN-SPECIFIC REAGENTS WITH TUNABLE PROPERTIES.

AS VIRUSES TEND TO MUTATE QUICKER THAN OTHER PATHOGENIC AGENTS (AND THUS NEWER STRAINS EMERGE TIME AND AGAIN), CONTINUOUS RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO COMBAT INFECTIOUS AGENTS. FOR PRECLINICAL RESEARCH, THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED ANIMAL MODELS ARE MICE AND RATS. THEY OFFER AN OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF GENETIC PROXIMITY TO HUMANS, COST FOR BREEDING AND COLONY MAINTENANCE POSSIBILITIES DUE TO THEIR SMALL SIZE. MICE OFFER THE BROADEST SPECTRUM OF AVAILABLE MODELS. RATS ARE THE SECOND MOST FREQUENTLY USED MAMMAL ANIMAL MODEL. IN FACT, SEVERAL SARS-COV- 2 RESEARCHERS ARE TURNING TO RATS. THEY ARE NO MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19 THAN MICE, BUT THEIR LARGER SIZE IS AN ADVANTAGE, AS, FOR EXAMPLE, RESEARCHERS OFTEN WANT TO DO REPETITIVE BLEEDING IN AN EXPERIMENT BUT CANNOT DO THAT WITH MICE. FURTHERMORE, AS VACCINE STUDIES OFTEN ASSESS HOW DIFFERENT DOSES AFFECT ANTIBODY RESPONSES OVER SEVERAL DAYS, MOST TOXICOLOGY STUDIES OF DRUGS ALSO START IN RAT. TO ACHIEVE INTERMITTENT INFUSIONS IN MOST NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCH, THE CURRENT PREVAILING ADMINISTRATION MODES FOR SMALL ANIMAL RESEARCH ARE MANUAL (ORAL, INTRAVENOUS, INTRAPERITONEAL, SUBCUTANEOUS) REQUIRING REPEATED HANDLING BY TRAINED TECHNICIANS. HOWEVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCHERS DESIRE THE LEAST NUMBER OF TOUCHPOINTS POSSIBLE WITH THEIR INFECTED ANIMALS, ESPECIALLY WHEN SHARP NEEDLES ARE INVOLVED THE PROPOSED FLUIDSYNC BSL3 SYSTEM MAY AID THE DISCOVERY OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR COVID-19 BY ENABLING CANDIDATE DRUGS TO BE ADMINISTERED TO MODEL ANIMALS INFECTED WITH SARS-COV-2 WHILE MINIMIZING INVESTIGATOR CONTACT. IT MAY ALSO BE USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES AND ANTIBODIES. THE SYSTEM BUILDS ON THE FIRST AND ONLY WIRELESS AND TETHER-FREE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM THAT CAN BE USED IN ANIMALS AS SMALL AS MICE. THE NEW SYSTEM WILL HAVE NEW CAPABILITIES INCLUDING I) A MEDICAL-GRADE PRIMARY BATTERY AND II) A PROGRAMMABLE SYSTEM-ON-CHIP INCLUDING BLUETOOTH TELEMETRY TRANSCEIVER, PROCESSOR AND MEMORY. ULTIMATELY, THE FLUIDSYNC BSL3 MICROINFUSION SYSTEM WOULD ENABLE AN INTELLIGENT INSTRUMENTED VIVARIUM SYSTEM THAT ADDRESSES MANY BSL3 USER REQUIREMENTS WITH BENEFITS INCLUDING INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY, REDUCED RESEARCHER EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY TOXIC DRUGS AND DISEASE VECTORS, EASE OF MANAGEMENT OF LARGE-SCALE ANIMAL STUDIES, AND MINIMIZED ANIMAL HANDLING TO REDUCE WHITE COAT EFFECTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ee45d070-d922-1d46-1140-5dc954037ff3-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44OD031437_7529"}, {"internal_id": 137716070, "Award ID": "R44OD030205", "Award Amount": 1972317.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-23", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "APTAMER THERAPEUTIC FOR SAFE AND LOW-COST TREATMENT OF SNAKE BITE ENVENOMATION - SNAKE BITE ENVENOMATION IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN THE US AND WORLDWIDE THAT CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MORBIDITY AND EVEN DEATH.

DUE TO THEIR FULLY SEQUENCED GENOME, GENETIC HOMOLOGY WITH HUMANS, EXTREMELY WELL CHARACTERIZED ANATOMY, AND EASE OF LAB CULTIVATION, C. ELEGANS ARE AN IDEAL MODEL ORGANISM FOR STUDYING FUNDAMENTAL BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND HAVE PROVIDED KEY INSIGHTS INTO THE PATHOLOGIES OF VARIOUS HUMAN DISEASES. MANY RESEARCH EFFORTS INVOLVING C. ELEGANS REQUIRE IMAGE-BASED ANALYSIS AND SUBSEQUENT SORTING BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE AGE OF THE WORMS OR PHENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL PLATFORMS FOR IMAGING-BASED ANALYSIS EXIST, THEY EITHER LACK HIGH-RESOLUTION 3D IMAGING CAPABILITIES, ARE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE, HAVE LOW BIOCOMPATIBILITY, AND/OR ARE FAR TOO TIME AND LABOR INTENSIVE TO BE SUITABLE FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT STUDIES. THESE DRAWBACKS DETRACT FROM THE OVERALL QUALITY OF C. ELEGANS RESEARCH, PARTICULARLY IN DRUG DISCOVERY, WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WORMS MUST BE RAPIDLY SORTED BASED ON MINUTE DIFFERENCES THAT CAN ONLY BE DETECTED WITH HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING.

IN PHASE II, OUR COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES WILL FOCUS ON SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ACOUSTOFLUIDIC-BASED 3D IMAGING AND SORTING CHIPS, DEVELOPING SELF-CONTAINED, BETA-TESTING-READY PROTOTYPES, AND VALIDATING AND OPTIMIZING THE BETA PROTOTYPES WITH END USERS. BY OPTIMIZING THE DESIGN OF OUR ACOUSTOFLUIDIC CHIPS, WE WILL IMPROVE THE THROUGHPUT (>1,000 WORMS/MIN), ROTATIONAL RESOLUTION (<1\u00b0), AND SORTING ACCURACY (>99%), WHILE RETAINING THE HIGH BIOCOMPATIBILITY (>99%) OF OUR ACOUSTOFLUIDIC TECHNOLOGY.

ANIMAL MODEL RESEARCH - PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  OVER HALF A BILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE CURRENTLY SUFFER FROM A CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASE AND IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATHS AND DISABILITY, AND THUS, RESPONSIBLE FOR 4 MILLION DEATHS A YEAR. THE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY MONITOR AND MEASURE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN ANIMAL MODELS, ESPECIALLY IN RODENTS, IS CRITICAL TO ADVANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NORMAL LUNG FUNCTIONS AND, IMPORTANTLY, THE MECHANISMS DRIVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES. BY IMPROVING THE TRANSLATION OF ANIMAL DATA, NEW RESPIRATORY THERAPIES CAN BE DEVELOPED, THUS ALLOWING CLINICIANS AND VETERINARIANS TO BETTER CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS. HOWEVER, PERFORMING PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS IN ANIMALS, ESPECIALLY IN SMALL ANIMALS, SUCH AS RATS AND MICE, IS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. CURRENT METHODS REQUIRE ANESTHESIA, RESTRAINT, OR IS INVASIVE, THUS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THEIR BREATHING PATTERNS. THIS RESULTS IN THE INTRODUCTION OF ERRORS INTO THE DATA, RESULTING IN IRREPRODUCIBILITY OF EXPERIMENTS AND REDUCING THEIR TRANSLATIONAL IMPACT ON IMPROVING HUMAN HEALTH. ADDITIONALLY, CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE EXPENSIVE AND INEFFECTIVE DUE TO LIMITED CAPACITY.  TO OVERCOME THE CURRENT LIMITATIONS IN PERFORMING PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS IN SMALL ANIMALS, AQUILLIUS CORPORATION IS PROPOSING PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PILOT STUDIES TO DEVELOP A NON-INVASIVE SENSOR CAPABLE OF REAL-TIME MONITORING AND MEASURING OF PULMONARY FUNCTION. EASILY APPLIED TO UNRESTRAINED AND AWAKE ANIMALS, THE RESPIRATORY SENSOR WILL REDUCE STRESS TO BOTH THE ANIMALS AND RESEARCHERS, THUS ENHANCING THE USABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF DATA. USING GRAPHENE NANOMATERIALS, THE SENSOR WILL BE COST-EFFECTIVE, ROBUST, AND CAN BE ADAPTED FOR FUTURE USE IN LARGER ANIMALS AND IN HUMANS. THUS, THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF A RESPIRATORY SENSOR THAT CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS PULMONARY FUNCTIONS WILL BE AN INVALUABLE TOOL THAT CAN ADVANCE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVE PATIENT CARE.

THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE FOR RAPID AND INEXPENSIVE PATHOGEN DETECTION DIRECTLY FROM AN ANIMAL OR FROM SOILED BEDDING. THE DEVICE WILL BE USED CAGE-SIDE AND WILL COMPLEMENT CURRENT RODENT HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAMS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO MONITOR ROOMS OR CAGE RACKS QUARTERLY.

THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PLATFORM WILL BE SPECIFICITY, SIMPLICITY, SPEED, AND SENSITIVITY IN A \u201c3RS\u201d CONSISTENT APPROACH. THE SPECIFICITY OF THE DETECTION SYSTEM RELIES ON DNA HYBRIDIZATION OF A SYNTHETIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDE DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PATHOGEN OF INTEREST WITH DNA CAPTURED FROM INFECTIOUS AGENTS DIRECTLY FROM THE RODENT OR FROM BEDDING SAMPLES. THE DETECTION STEP WILL BE RAPID SINCE THE DNA HYBRIDIZATION WILL NOT RELY ON CYCLIC AMPLIFICATION OF THE DNA BUT INSTEAD WILL SHIFT THE SENSITIVITY REQUIREMENTS TO RELEASE OF DYE FROM MESOPOROUS SILICA NANOPARTICLES USING PH-DEPENDENT DYE RELEASE.

MOREOVER, CURRENT IMAGING TECHNIQUES TYPICALLY ONLY VISUALIZE MORPHOLOGY AND STRUCTURE. THEREFORE, IMAGING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN CHARACTERIZE METABOLIC CHANGES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DETECT DISEASE PROCESSES LONG BEFORE DISEASE SYMPTOMS ARE PRONOUNCED. METABOLIC AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING THUS ALLOWS MUCH EARLIER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. IN VIVO METABOLIC IMAGING, WHICH DISTINGUISHES CHANGES IN THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS THAT MAKE UP CELLULAR PROCESSES, CAN BE USED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DISEASE ONSET AND PROGRESSION. CURRENT METABOLIC IMAGING TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS PET AND SPECT, ARE EXPENSIVE, DIFFICULT, AND NOT CONDUCIVE FOR LONGITUDINAL STUDIES DUE TO THE USE OF RADIOACTIVE CONTRAST AGENTS. THEREFORE, THE BROAD CLINICAL UTILIZATION OF THESE TECHNIQUES IS LIMITED IN SCOPE. IN PRECLINICAL MODELS, OTHER TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS TISSUE SLICING OF SACRIFICED ANIMALS FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY ANALYSIS, NEED TO BE EMPLOYED TO STUDY CELLULAR METABOLISM, RESULTING IN A VERY LARGE TRANSLATIONAL GAP BETWEEN PRECLINICAL ANIMAL MODELS AND CLINICAL STUDIES.

EACH TANK WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH A CUSTOM ILLUMINATION SYSTEM AND A CAMERA THAT WILL USE AN ORIGINAL \"REMANENT IMAGING\" PARADIGM TO CAPTURE AND PROCESS ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LESS DATA THAN STANDARD VIDEO WHILE PRESERVING TRANSIENT, MILLISECOND-SCALE MOTION SIGNATURES. THREATS TO FISH HEALTH\u2014NONE OF WHICH ARE TRACKED BY CURRENT COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS\u2014WILL BE DETECTED THROUGH THE REAL TIME ANALYSIS OF MOTION SIGNATURES IN THE IMAGE STREAMS CAPTURED BY THE CANARYTANKS AND WILL BE REMOTELY ACCESSIBLE VIA BROWSER THROUGH OUR CLOUD-BASED SOFTWARE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FIRST AIM IS TO SHOW THAT SUCH A SYSTEM CAN GENERATE TIMELY AND ACCURATE DAILY REPORTS OF FISH ACTIVITY AND SLEEP (ACTIMETRY), FEEDING TIMES, AND CHANGES IN ROOM ILLUMINATION BASED SOLELY ON PROCESSING THE BEHAVIORAL DATA IN THE IMAGES CAPTURED CONTINUOUSLY BY THE CANARYTANKS. THE SECOND AIM IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE SYSTEM\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE REAL-TIME ALERT NOTIFICATIONS USING CUSTOM ALGORITHMS THAT AUTOMATICALLY DETECT A RANGE OF ZEBRAFISH BEHAVIORAL SIGNATURES. A BATTERY OF TESTS, INCLUDING DISRUPTION OF THE LIGHT CYCLE, EXPOSURE TO NOISE/VIBRATION AND GRADUAL INCREASE TO OUT-OF-RANGE TEMPERATURES, WILL VALIDATE THIS PROOF-OF-CONCEPT. THE FUTURE VISION IS THAT THE CANARYTANK TECHNOLOGY SETS NEW STANDARDS IN FISH HUSBANDRY AND PROVIDES REVOLUTIONARY, UBIQUITOUS IN-TANK RECORDING CAPABILITIES THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED BEYOND HUSBANDRY FOR COLLECTION OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0807e20f-a6ad-7201-580f-ae518e0fa2e1-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43OD030199_7529"}, {"internal_id": 137716432, "Award ID": "R43OD030028", "Award Amount": 144560.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-29", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "SAME DAY EMBRYO VIABILITY SENSOR FOR HIGH THROUGHPUT EMBRYO TRANSFER SELECTION - ABSTRACT  THE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH COMMUNITY EXTENSIVELY RELIES ON THE AVAILABILITY AND CONTINUED UTILIZATION OF THE RODENT RESEARCH MODEL. WITH THE DISCOVERY OF CRISPR, AND THE UNPRECEDENTED DEGREE WITH WHICH IT ALLOWED SCIENTISTS TO MANIPULATE THE GENOME, AN EXPLOSION OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT MODELS HAS MADE THEIR WAY INTO EXISTENCE. THIS LEADING EDGE OF PRECISION MEDICINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PHENOTYPING OF HARMFUL SNP MUTATIONS, MODELING OF DISEASE VARIANTS IN ETHNICALLY DISTINCT POPULATIONS, AND UNDERSTANDING OF ORPHAN DISEASES. PRODUCTION OF THESE MODELS HEAVILY RELIES UPON IN-VITRO ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNIQUES INCLUDING CRYO- PRESERVATION, GENE EDITING, AND IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION HOWEVER THESE TECHNIQUES ALSO REDUCE THE REPRODUCTIVE VIABILITY OF EMBRYOS AND THE PERCENTAGE OF LIVE-BORN. AS THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE MODELS CONTINUES TO INCREASE FACILITIES REQUIRE AUTOMATED AND STANDARDIZED IN-VITRO ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TOOLS TO FLEXIBLY SCALE WITH DEMAND AND MAINTAIN LARGER LITTERS. TO DATE EMBRYO HANDLING HAS BEEN DONE VIA MOUTH PIPETTING, AND EMBRYO VIABILITY HAS BEEN ASSESSED THROUGH ATTRITION BY EITHER TRANSFERRING ALL THE AVAILABLE EMBRYOS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OR WAITING SEVERAL DAYS FOR THE DAMAGED CELLS TO EVENTUALLY ARREST LEAVING SOME COMPETENT BLASTOCYSTS. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAVE MEASURED OOCYTE/EMBRYO MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AS A NON-INVASIVE BIO- MARKER OF VIABILITY BY OPTICALLY MEASURING EMBRYO DEFORMATION WHEN ASPIRATING THROUGH A MICRO-PIPETTE; HOWEVER, THIS TECHNIQUE IS STILL MANUALLY DEMANDING AND MEASUREMENT COLLECTION SYSTEMS ARE IMPERFECT. WE PROPOSE BUILDING A HIGH-THROUGHPUT MICROFLUIDIC LAB ON CHIP THAT CAN IDENTIFY THE VIABILITY OF EMBRYOS IMMEDIATELY AFTER EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES BROUGHT ON FROM CRYO-PRESERVATION, GENE EDITING, AND IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION. BUILDING ON THE KNOWN PREDICTIVE POWER OF ZYGOTE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND RAVATA\u2019S MICRO-ELECTRODE PLATFORM, WE WOULD VALIDATE AN ELECTRICAL SENSOR ARRAY TO ELECTRICALLY QUANTIFY EMBRYO

ASSESSMENT - PROJECT SUMMARY  WE PROPOSE DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING A NOVEL PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT COMBINES THE COLLECTION AND CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF ULTRAFINE PARTICLES USING AN IN-SITU MULTISPECTRAL TECHNIQUE. THE SAMPLE, COLLECTED DIRECTLY ONTO THE ANALYSIS SUBSTRATE, IS ANALYZED VIA EXCITATION-EMISSION MATRIX (EEM) SPECTROSCOPY. THIS APPROACH WILL BE VALIDATED AGAINST LABORATORY COMBUSTION-GENERATED AEROSOLS, SUCH AS DIESEL EXHAUST, WOOD SMOKE, TOBACCO SMOKE, AND AGAINST A MIXTURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS. WITHIN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT, PARTICLE SIZE DETERMINES THE REGION OF DEPOSITION AND TISSUE UPTAKE; THE CHEMISTRY OF THE PARTICLE ALSO AFFECTS SOLUBILITY AND DETERMINES THE POTENTIAL FOR BIOCHEMICAL REACTION WITH TISSUES AND CELLS. THERE IS A GROWING AWARENESS THAT EXPOSURE SCENARIOS ARE VERY COMPLEX, CONSISTING OF TIME-VARYING CONCENTRATIONS AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OVER A BROAD RANGE OF PARTICLE SIZES. LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION HAS ALSO BEEN LINKED TO INCREASED MORTALITY RATES FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING COVID-19. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR IMPROVED PERSONAL EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ULTRAFINE PARTICLES IN THE ENVIRONMENT. LOW-COST, MINIATURIZED EXPOSURE MONITORING DEVICES CAN SHED INSIGHT INTO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO POLLUTANTS AND HEALTH IMPACT. SOURCE APPORTIONED MEASUREMENTS OF PM CONCENTRATION WITH HIGH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION CAN FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTIMAL AIR POLLUTION MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE ANTICIPATED OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MINIATURIZED SPECTROSCOPIC SENSOR THAT PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF COMBUSTION-GENERATED ULTRAFINE PARTICLES, WHICH BOTH REFLECTS THE PARTICLE SOURCES AND DETERMINES THEIR TOXIC POTENTIAL.

THE GENOME EDITING SYSTEM CRISPR/CAS9 IS A RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN GENE THERAPY. BOTH VIRAL AND NON-VIRAL VECTORS HAVE BEEN USED IN ATTEMPTS TO DIRECT DELIVERY OF CAS9 TO SPECIFIC LOCATIONS WITH ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE KNOWN FOR OTHER NUCLEIC ACID-BASED THERAPEUTICS. THESE CHALLENGES HAVE LIMITED THE CURRENT CLINICAL PROGRESS OF THIS GENOME-EDITING TOOL. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE TARGETED DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR CAS9-MEDIATED GENOME EDITING. THE INVESTIGATORS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A NOVEL TECHNOLOGY FOR DELIVERY OF PLASMID DNA (PDNA) BASED ON BOVINE MILK/COLOSTRUM EXOSOMES DEVELOPED IN THE PI'S LABORATORY. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL APPLY OUR KNOWLEDGE AND EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN EXOSOMES FOR EFFICIENT TARGETED DELIVERY OF THE CAS9-MEDIATED GENOME- EDITING TOOL. TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY, WE HAVE USED PDNA TO DELIVER THE CODING SEQUENCES FOR CAS9-MEDIATED KNOCKOUT OF NFB AS A MODEL GENE. THIS SINGLE PLASMID, PKO-NFB, CONTAINS THE MAMMALIAN-OPTIMIZED CAS9 CODING SEQUENCE, THE SINGLE-GUIDE RNA (SGRNA) SPECIFIC TO NFB, AS WELL AS SEQUENCES TO DERIVE A GUIDE RNA (GRNA) SCAFFOLD TO ASSIST IN THE BINDING OF CAS9 TO THE TARGET DNA. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT PKO-NFB, IONICALLY ENTRAPPED IN A NOVEL EXOSOME MATRIX, FORMULATED BY COMPLEXING EXOSOMES AND POLYCATIONIC POLYETHYLENEIMINE (PEI), WILL SERVE AS AN EFFECTIVE GENOME-EDITING TOOL OF NFB.

"DROSOPHILA MODELS OF HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASES - PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT DEFECTS IN MITOCHONDRIA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECTRUM OF CONDITIONS, RANGING FROM METABOLIC AND DEGENERATIVE DISEASES TO PREMATURE AGING. MITOCHONDRIAL DEFECTS ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE ORGAN DEFECTS, INCLUDING MUSCULAR WEAKNESS, CARDIAC FAILURE, DIABETES, RENAL DYSFUNCTION, AND HEPATIC DISEASE. ONE APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSIOPATHOLOGY OF MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASES IS TO CREATE ANIMAL MODELS THAT ENABLE DETAILED MECHANISTIC STUDIES OF THE UNDERLYING PERTURBATIONS. DROSOPHILA IS AN ESTABLISHED COST-EFFECTIVE MODEL SYSTEM FOR STUDYING HUMAN DISEASES, INCLUDING MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASES. VALIDATION OF FLY MODELS RELIES ON TWO CRITICAL SETS OF TOOLS: REAGENTS THAT PERTURB GENE FUNCTION AND REAGENTS THAT RECOGNIZE PROTEINS. WHILE PERTURBATION REAGENTS ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR NEARLY ALL 14,000 DROSOPHILA GENES, THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW REAGENTS FOR DETECTION OF FLY PROTEINS. OUR PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON GENERATING REAGENTS THAT WILL SERVE AS A RESOURCE TO ENABLE THE CHARACTERIZATION AND VALIDATION OF DROSOPHILA MODELS OF HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASES. WE WILL GENERATE TWO SETS OF REAGENTS, BASED ON THE TARGET GENE STRUCTURE, FOR THE DETECTION OF PROTEINS ENCODED BY 394 HIGH CONFIDENCE DROSOPHILA ORTHOLOGS OF HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE GENES. FOR GROUP 1 GENES (AIM 1), WHERE ALL ISOFORMS SHARE THE SAME C-TERMINUS EXON, WE WILL INSERT A NANOTAG EPITOPE AT THE C-TERMINUS OF THE ENDOGENOUS GENE USING CRISPR-BASED GENOME ENGINEERING. WE SELECTED THE 3\u2019 END TO INSERT THE TAG AS INSERTING IT AT THE N TERMINUS COULD INTERFERE WITH THE MITOCHONDRIAL LOCALIZATION SIGNAL. THE RESULTING PROTEIN FUSIONS CAN THEN BE RECOGNIZED BY AN EXISTING HIGH-AFFINITY NANOBODY AGAINST THE NANOTAG. FOR GROUP 2 GENES (AIM 2), WHICH ENCODE MULTIPLE ISOFORMS, INCLUDING SOME WITH DIFFERENT C-TERMINUS EXONS, WE WILL USE A PROTEIN DOMAIN COMMON TO ALL ISOFORMS TO SCREEN FOR NANOBODIES. THESE REAGENTS WILL BE USED TOGETHER WITH EXISTING RNAI TRANSGENIC LINES TO VALIDATE FLY MODELS OF HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASES (AIM 3). THE RESOURCE OF NANOBODIES AND FLY STOCKS WITH NANOTAGS \u2018KNOCKED-IN\u2019 TO ENDOGENOUS GENES WILL DRAMATICALLY EXPAND THE SCOPE OF AVAILABLE REAGENTS FOR DETECTION AND BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF FLY MITOCHONDRIAL PROTEINS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "81e3f12d-5809-de22-dbd3-10b61910a90c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R24OD035556_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160602034, "Award ID": "R24OD035499", "Award Amount": 345000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-26", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description": "MODERNIZING A SHARED-USE LARGE ANIMAL FACILITY SUPPORTING TRANSLATIONAL HIBERNATION RESEARCH AT UAF - SUMMARY THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS (UAF), AN ALASKAN-NATIVE SERVING INSTITUTION, IS A LEADER IN HIBERNATION RESEARCH AND HOUSES THE CENTER FOR TRANSFORMATIVE RESEARCH IN METABOLISM (TRIM), THE FIRST NIH COBRE SUPPORTED BIOMEDICAL CENTER IN THE U.S. UTILIZING HIBERNATION AS A MODEL OF NATURAL ADAPTATION TO METABOLIC DISEASE, MUSCLE ATROPHY AND ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION. BESIDES THE SMALLER HIBERNATORS ALSO STUDIED IN THE FACILITIES OF THE ANIMAL RESOURCE CENTER, AMERICAN BLACK BEARS (URSUS AMERICANUS) ARE HIBERNATORS WITH SIZE, PHYSIOLOGY AND ANATOMY FAR CLOSER TO HUMANS THAN RODENTS, MAKING THEM AN IDEAL TRANSLATIONAL MODEL FOR HIBERNATION RESEARCH. UAF HAS A STATE-OF-THE-ART BEAR HIBERNATION FACILITY TO STUDY METABOLIC SUPPRESSION AND RESILIENCE TO DISEASE WITH EXTENSIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING, AND WITH ACCESS TO AN MRI SCANNER DEDICATED TO RESEARCH IN THE MOLECULAR IMAGING FACILITY, BUT CURRENTLY LACKS CAGING OPTIONS FOR LONG-TERM HOLDING OF BEARS IN SUMMER. THE CURRENT CAGING AT THE LARGE ANIMAL ISOLATION FACILITY IS OUTDATED AND ONLY APPROVED FOR HOLDING BEARS FOR UP TO TWO WEEKS. THIS PREVENTS USE OF \"PROBLEM BEARS\" THAT ONLY BECOME AVAILABLE IN MID-SUMMER WHEN THE ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME (ADF&G) OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE EUTHANIZED THEM, AND MAKING LONG-TERM SUMMER CONTROL EXPERIMENTS AND STUDY OF TRANSITIONS INTO HIBERNATION IMPOSSIBLE. THE PROPOSED MODERNIZATION OF THE LARGE ANIMAL ISOLATION FACILITY WILL IMPROVE WELFARE FOR BLACK BEARS AND ALLOW LONG TERM SUMMER EXPERIMENTS, BETTER QUALITY OF RESEARCH AND THEREBY SUPPORT UAF FACULTY, UAA COLLABORATORS AS WELL AS POST- DOCTORAL, GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS. THE MODERNIZATION WILL PROVIDE BOTH INDIVIDUAL INDOOR AND NATURAL OUTDOOR AREA CAGING TO ALLOW GREATER ENRICHMENT AND EXERCISE OPPORTUNITIES AND FLEXIBILITY THAT CAN REDUCE INTER-INDIVIDUAL AGGRESSION IN A SPECIES- SPECIFIC FASHION. THIS MODERNIZATION IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE EACH ENRICHMENT ELEMENT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE STRESS AND STEREOTYPICAL BEHAVIOR IN CAPTIVE BEARS AND THUS IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF SCIENTIFIC DATA FROM THESE MODELS. TOGETHER THESE MODERNIZATIONS WILL ALLOW UAF RESEARCHERS GREATER ACCESS TO SUMMER CONTROLS ANIMALS FOR HIBERNATION STUDIES AND OPENS UAF UP TO THE POSSIBILITY OF RECEIVING MORE PROBLEM BEARS FROM ADF&G DURING THE TIME OF YEAR HUMAN-BEAR CONFLICTS OFTEN OCCUR IN ALASKA.

THIS 5,644 SF STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITY ACCOMMODATES A TOTAL OF NEARLY 9,000 TANKS IN FOUR ANIMAL HOLDING ROOMS WITH INDEPENDENT RECIRCULATING WATER SYSTEMS. THE FACILITY PROVIDES OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR THE REARING AND MAINTENANCE OF UP TO 200,000 FISH. STARTING WITH FOUR ZEBRAFISH LABORATORIES IN 2011, THE FACILITY CURRENTLY SUPPORTS RESEARCH OF 33 INDEPENDENT LABORATORIES. PRESENTLY, OVER 100 GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS AND SCIENTISTS CARRY OUT RESEARCH IN THE FACILITY THAT IS SUPPORTED BY R00, R01, R54, AND P01 GRANTS FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. THE FACILITY ALSO SUPPORTS OTHER EDUCATIONAL AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS. THE FACILITY ENABLES THESE PROGRAMS BY ENSURING SUPERIOR HUSBANDRY WITH AUTOMATIC FEEDING THAT HALVES THE TIME ZEBRAFISH GROW TO ADULTHOOD; SUPPLYING WILD-TYPE LINES AND EMBRYOS FOR EXPERIMENTATION, CRYOPRESERVING SPERM TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF LINES MAINTAINED AS LIFE STOCKS, CONDUCTING PATHOLOGICAL TESTING; MAINTAINING QUARANTINE SYSTEM FOR IMPORTED LINES, PROVIDING RESEARCH SERVICES SUCH AS GENOME ENGINEERING, AND WASHING AND DISINFECTING HOLDING AND BREEDING TANKS AND THEIR COMPONENTS TO ENSURE SAFE AND EFFICIENT RESEARCH OPERATIONS. THE CONTINUED INCREASE OF THE ZEBRAFISH USERS AND EXPANSION TO 9,000 TANKS REQUIRES MODERN, TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED EQUIPMENT TO CLEAN AND DISINFECT, ON A DAILY BASIS, HUNDREDS OF HOLDING AND BREEDING TANKS, AND TANK COMPONENTS AS WELL AS FISH NETS TO ENSURE SAFE AND EFFICIENT ZEBRAFISH RESEARCH. HERE WE PROPOSE REPLACING THE EXISTING 900 GP WALK IN WASHER (TECNIPLAST) WITH THE NEXT GENERATION ALPHA WALK IN WASHER MODEL (TECNIPLAST). THE EXISTING 900 GP WASHER IS A PROTOTYPE AQUATICS WASHER WITH SEVERAL LIMITATIONS: IT USES STEAM LINES TO HEAT WATER, IS ENERGETICALLY INEFFICIENT, REQUIRES LONG WASH CYCLES, USES AN EXTERNAL CHEMICAL DOSING SYSTEM, AND BREAKS DOWN FREQUENTLY. THESE INEFFICIENCIES AND FREQUENT DOWNTIMES INCREASE MANUAL LABOR, LIMITING AND SLOWING DOWN THE FACILITY OPERATIONS AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES IT SUPPORTS. THE ALPHA MODEL DEPLOYS ADAPTIVE CLEANING TECHNOLOGY THAT COMBINES INDEPENDENT VERTICAL AND OSCILLATING MOVEMENTS ALLOWING FOR SUPERIOR WATER COVERAGE. THE ALPHA WASHER USES ELECTRICITY TO HEAT WATER, SHORTER WASH CYCLES AND THUS HIGHER THROUGHPUT THAT WOULD MEET THE CONTINUALLY GROWING WASHING NEEDS OF THE ZEBRAFISH RESEARCHERS. THE RESERVOIR FOR THE CHEMICALS USED DURING WASH CYCLES FIT INTO THE MACHINE FOOTPRINT. OPERATIONS WITH THE ALPHA WASHER WOULD REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WITH A SHORTER WASH CYCLE AND CONSUMING SMALLER AMOUNTS OF CHEMICALS PER CYCLE.

HOWEVER, A PERVASIVE LACK OF REPRODUCIBILITY IN CRYOPRESERVATION CREATES A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER, POSING A GREAT RISK OF LOSING VALUABLE LINES DEVELOPED FROM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RESEARCH INVESTMENT. THERE ARE TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS: FIRST, ALTHOUGH PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THROUGH BASIC RESEARCH, LABORATORIES OFTEN PRODUCE LOW-QUALITY SAMPLES BECAUSE OF A LACK OF AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE HARDWARE FOR A STANDARDIZED PRODUCTION PATHWAY. SECOND, THERE ARE NO EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TO PROVIDE QUALITY MANAGEMENT AT A SYSTEM LEVEL, INCLUDING QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR PREVENTION OF DEFECTS, AND QUALITY CONTROL FOR ELIMINATION OF INFERIOR PRODUCTS.

THE PROPOSED REQUEST WILL FOSTER OUR ROBUST AND PRODUCTIVE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM INVOLVING LABORATORY ANIMALS. THE UTEP BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM IS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABORATORY ANIMAL RESOURCES CENTER (LARC) IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC). THE LARC MANAGES AND MONITORS THE HOUSING AND USE OF RESEARCH ANIMALS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAWS AND GUIDELINES AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL POLICY. THE LARC SUPPORTS THE MAIN ANIMAL FACILITY IN THE BIOSCIENCES BUILDING, AND THE 3 ADDITIONAL ANIMAL SATELLITE FACILITIES IN PSYCHOLOGY, BIOLOGY AND THE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH BUILDING (IDRB). THEIR OVERSIGHT ALSO INCLUDES OUR ZEBRA FISH AQUARIUM AS WELL AS 2 FIELD RESEARCH STATIONS LOCATED OFF OF OUR MAIN CAMPUS. THE ANIMAL FACILITIES ARE DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE EXQUISITELY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND CARE AND USE OF LABORATORY ANIMALS. IN A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS AND PROJECTED GROWTH, WE IDENTIFIED A CRITICAL NEED FOR A CAGE/RACK WASHER IN THE BIOSCIENCES MAIN ANIMAL FACILITY. THE CURRENT WASHER HAS BEEN IN USE FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS, AND HAS EXCEEDED ITS 10-YEAR LIFE EXPECTANCY. THIS WASHER IS CRITICAL TO OUR OPERATIONS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES SANITIZING SERVICES FOR EQUIPMENT USED IN THE MAIN ANIMAL FACILITY AS WELL AS FOR RESEARCH INVOLVING ANIMALS HOUSED IN THE BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY ANIMAL FACILITIES. THE SANITIZING SERVICES IN THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED IDRB FACILITY IS BEING SUPPORTED BY ITS OWN WASHER THAT PROVIDES SERVICES FOR 3 INVESTIGATORS AND THEIR 3 PROJECTS AS WELL AS BEING USED AS A BACK-UP WASHER FOR THE ONE IN THE MAIN ANIMAL FACILITY DUE TO FREQUENT MALFUNCTIONING.

HIGH PROFILE RESEARCH USING BABOONS IS PART OF UMB'S RESEARCH PORTFOLIO. RECENTLY, CARDIAC XENOTRANSPLANTATION RESEARCH AT UMB RESULTED IN A MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH WHERE THE HEART OF A GENETICALLY MODIFIED PIG WAS TRANSPLANTED INTO A HUMAN. THIS ACHIEVEMENT WAS SUPPORTED BY WORK DONE WITH BABOONS WITHIN UMB'S PROGRAM FOR COMPARATIVE MEDICINE AND VETERINARY RESOURCES (VR) ANIMAL FACILITIES. XENOTRANSPLANTATION MAY SOON BE AN OPTION FOR THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES WAITING FOR TRANSPLANTS, MANY OF WHOM WILL DIE BEFORE THEY RECEIVE AN ORGAN.

AS A LARGER, MORE SENTIENT SPECIES WITH OPPOSABLE THUMBS, BABOON CAGING, ENRICHMENT, WELFARE, AND SAFETY CAN BE QUITE COMPLEX. THE GROUNDBREAKING XENOTRANSPLANTATION RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT UMB IS GROWING, AND THE NEED FOR MORE ANIMALS AND NEW CAGING HAS INCREASED. VR'S CURRENT CAGE INVENTORY IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THIS GROWTH. IN THE MATERNAL-FETAL RESEARCH PROGRAM, BREEDING ANIMALS MUST BE CO-HOUSED, WHICH REQUIRES FLEXIBLE CAGE CONFIGURATIONS, LARGER CAGES, AND ADDITIONAL CAGES FOR WEANED AND JUVENILE BABOONS.

IN THIS CAPACITY, A SAFE AND RELIABLE METHOD FOR CRYOPRESERVATION OF ZEBRAFISH LINES WOULD PROVIDE A MEANS TO BANK PRECIOUS RESOURCES FOR THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A ZEBRAFISH EMBRYO AND LARVAE CRYOPRESERVATION PROTOCOL THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH DIFFERENT STORAGE TEMPERATURES AND TO TRAIN EXTERNAL LABS WITH AN EASY TO IMPLEMENT PROTOCOL THROUGH EXTENSIVE DISSEMINATION EFFORTS. WHILE THE FIELD HAS BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL IN ESTABLISHING SPERM BANKS FOR A RANGE OF FISH, EGG/EMBRYO CRYOPRESERVATION HAS BEEN MET WITH SEVERE CHALLENGES, DESPITE THE CLEAR ADVANTAGES. CRYOPRESERVATION OF SPERM REQUIRES AT LEAST 6 MONTHS TO GENERATE AN ADULT STRAIN, IN CONTRAST TO CRYOPRESERVATION OF EMBRYOS THAT WOULD ENABLE MORE RAPID AND DIRECT USE UPON THAWING. HOWEVER, THE TWO MAIN CRYOPRESERVATION APPROACHES \u2013 SLOW COOLING AND VITRIFICATION \u2013 EACH HAVE SEVERE LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE REMAINED INSURMOUNTABLE. SLOW COOLING USES LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF CRYOPROTECTANT AGENTS (CPAS) YET MUST COMPETE WITH EXTENSIVE ICE FORMATION THAT CAN DAMAGE CELLS. ALTERNATIVELY, ICE-FREE METHODS, SUCH AS VITRIFICATION, REQUIRE HIGH CONCENTRATION OF TOXIC CPAS AND HIGH COOLING RATES THAT LIMIT SCALABILITY.

INTERRUPTED COOLING USES LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF CPAS AS SAMPLES ARE SLOWLY COOLED TO HIGH SUBZERO TEMPERATURES (~-20\u00b0C) WITH LIMITED ICE FORMATION, BEFORE A RAPID COOLING PROTOCOL TO DEEP CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES THAT CONVERTS THE REMAINING UNFROZEN FRACTION INTO A VITREOUS-LIKE STATE.

BECAUSE HUMIDITY LEVELS ARE SO HIGH AT SALK, CAGES OFTEN MUST BE CHANGED TWICE A WEEK. SWITCHING TO VENTILATED CAGING WILL EXTEND THE TIME BETWEEN CAGE CHANGES TO 10\u201314 DAYS. FURTHER, THE PROPOSED FLOOR PLAN MINIMIZES THE NEED TO ROLL RACKS TO ACCESS MICE, THEREBY REDUCING MOUSE EXPOSURE TO NOISE AND VIBRATION. THUS, A CRITICAL FEATURE OF THE MODERNIZED CRAF ABSL2 SUITE IS A REDUCTION IN NON-EXPERIMENTAL HUSBANDRY VARIABLES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT RESEARCH RESULTS. FINALLY, IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS FACILITY ARE AN INSTITUTE PRIORITY, AS MOUSE ABSL2 WORK IS AT THE CENTER OF THE INSTITUTE\u2019S FUTURE RESEARCH ENDEAVORS, WHICH INCLUDE CANCER BIOLOGY, NEUROSCIENCE, AND AGING. RESEARCHERS WITHIN EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS USE, AND OFTEN DEVELOP, CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES THAT REQUIRE ABSL2 FACILITIES TO TARGET AND MANIPULATE SPECIFIC CELL TYPES WITHIN MOUSE MODELS. SALK\u2019S LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO THESE RESEARCH EFFORTS AND ASSOCIATED MOUSE ABSL2 WORK IS REFLECTED IN FUNDRAISING INITIATIVES DEDICATED TO CONQUERING CANCER, NEUROSCIENCE, AND HEALTHY AGING. IN SUPPORT OF THESE RESEARCH PRIORITIES, THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO: 1) REPLACE STATIC CAGES WITHIN THE CRAF ABSL2 SUITE WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART IVC RACKS, 2) INCREASE CAGE CAPACITY WITHIN THE ABSL2 SUITE TO MEET RESEARCH DEMANDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, AND 3) ENHANCE THE RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF MOUSE ABSL2 RESEARCH BY MINIMIZING ANIMAL STRESS.

THE GNAC IS A COMPLETE RESEARCH SUPPORT FACILITY: WE CREATE AND CARE FOR GNOTOBIOTIC AND GERM-FREE MICE HOUSED IN THE CORE AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR DIVERSE GNOTOBIOTIC RESEARCH NEEDS. A PARTICULAR STRENGTH OF THE CORE IS THAT NEW INVESTIGATORS CAN CONDUCT SMALL PILOT PROJECTS BY USING THE READY-TO-GO EXPERTISE OF GNAC STAFF EVEN IF THEY DO NOT HAVE THE EXTENSIVE TRAINING NEEDED FOR SUCH STUDIES. THE GNAC HAS BEEN OPERATIONAL FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS, AND DURING THIS PERIOD, MORE THAN FORTY INVESTIGATORS FROM FIFTEEN DIFFERENT RESEARCH GROUPS HAVE USED THE GNAC.

INFLAMMATION IS A COMMON PROCESS INVOLVED IN AGING, OBESITY, AND PATHOLOGIES SUCH AS INFECTIOUS DISEASES, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, AND AGE-RELATED NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BEING MODELED IN THESE SPECIES.

DESPITE THESE SUCCESSES, THE TREATMENT ALSO HAS SEVERE TOXICITIES DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES. CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS), MANIFESTING AS SERUM CYTOKINE OVER-PRODUCTION, FEVER, HYPOTENSION, AND MULTIPLE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION/FAILURE, IS ONE OF THE MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS THAT CAN CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE TO PATIENTS IF LEFT WITHOUT PROPER CLINICAL INTERVENTION. WHILE CLINICAL PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO MITIGATE THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CRS IN CLINIC, THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXCESSIVE CYTOKINE SECRETION REMAINS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD. ONE OF THE MAJOR HURDLES IS THE LACK OF PRECLINICAL MODELS THAT CAN FULLY RECAPITULATE THE CAR-T CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNE INTERACTIONS. HEMATOPOIETIC HUMANIZED (HU) MOUSE MODELS ARE A POWERFUL PLATFORM TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL CRS, AND HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN DEVELOPING NOVEL THERAPIES TO MITIGATE CRS- MEDICATED TOXICITIES.

THE PI MAINTAINS BY FAR THE LARGEST BREEDING AND RESEARCH COLONY OF THIS SPECIES IN THE WORLD. THE MOST CRITICAL BARRIER TO FULFILLING THE RESEARCH POTENTIAL OF THE LABORATORY OPOSSUM IS THE LACK OF SUCCESS OF ANYONE IN THE US IN ESTABLISHING GENE-EDITING PROCEDURES FOR THIS SPECIES. A JAPANESE GROUP RECENTLY OVERCAME THE TECHNOLOGICAL IMPEDIMENTS TO GENE EDITING OF THIS SPECIES, AND SUCCEEDED IN KNOCKING OUT THE TYROSINASE (TYR) GENE IN RANDOM-BRED OPOSSUMS. THE IMPLEMENTATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF THEIR METHODS AT THE PI\u2019S LABORATORY WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR ACHIEVING THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE, WHICH IS TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL RESEARCH RESOURCE THAT WILL EFFICIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY CREATE GENE- EDITED OPOSSUMS REQUIRED BY US INVESTIGATORS TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT BIOMEDICAL QUESTIONS THAT THIS LABORATORY ANIMAL IS UNIQUELY SUITED TO ADDRESS. WHILE THE VOLUME OF RESEARCH WITH THIS SPECIES AT ANY SINGLE INSTITUTION CANNOT JUSTIFY THE COST OF ESTABLISHING A LARGE COLONY AND GENE EDITING TECHNOLOGIES, A CENTRALIZED RESOURCE WILL BE CAPABLE OF SERVING ALL OF THE NATIONAL NEEDS AT MINIMAL COST. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE 1) TO ESTABLISH EXPERTISE AND PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE IN OUR LABORATORY BY TARGETED DISRUPTION OF TYR IN A FULLY INBRED STRAIN OF LABORATORY OPOSSUMS, AND 2) TO CONDUCT TARGETED DISRUPTION OF THE PHOSPHATASE AND TENSIN HOMOLOG GENE (PTEN) IN OPOSSUMS OF THE SAME INBRED STRAIN.

HOWEVER, SOME KEY TECHNICAL AND CONCEPTUAL ISSUES REMAIN PROBLEMATIC IN VERTEBRATES, PARTICULARLY IN AQUATIC MODEL ORGANISMS SUCH ZEBRAFISH. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MATERNALLY PROVIDED MRNA CAN RESCUE THE PHENOTYPE OF HOMOZYGOUS MUTANTS; GENOTYPING STEPS ARE TEDIOUS; AND LONG NON- CODING RNA, LETHAL OR TISSUE/TEMPORAL GENES ARE DIFFICULT TO STUDY USING DNA MANIPULATION AS WELL AS COMPLEX GENOMIC LOCI. COMPLEMENTARY \u2018KNOCK-DOWN\u2019 APPROACHES ARE INVALUABLE TOOLS TO CIRCUMVENT SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SYSTEMATIC TOOL TO KNOCKDOWN MRNAS IN ZEBRAFISH OR OTHER TELEOST FISH. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO UNRAVEL THE FUNCTION OF GENES RELATED TO REGULATORY MECHANISMS, DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN DISEASES. OUR RECENT PUBLICATION DEMONSTRATES THAT INJECTION OF THE CRISPR-RFXCAS13D SYSTEM INTO VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS PROVIDES A ROBUST AND COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO SYSTEMATICALLY DISRUPT GENE FUNCTION. HOWEVER, THE INJECTION OF THIS SYSTEM ONLY PROVIDES TRANSIENT KNOCKDOWN FOR ~3 DAYS. THEREFORE, THE CENTRAL GOAL OF THE PROPOSAL IS TO TRANSFER THE CRISPR-RFXCAS13D TECHNOLOGY FROM BEING INJECTED INTO VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS, TO BEING ENDOGENOUSLY EXPRESSED THROUGH TRANSGENESIS. WE PROPOSE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REPERTOIRE TRANSGENIC ZEBRAFISH EXPRESSING THE RFXCAS13D ENZYME (UBIQUITOUS AND TISSUES-SPECIFIC) AND GUIDERNA WOULD FACILITATE RAPID AND VIGOROUS INVESTIGATION INTO GENE FUNCTIONS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT TRANSGENIC EXPRESSION OF RFXCAS13D IN ZEBRAFISH IS FUNCTIONAL AND NOT TOXIC. THE OBJECTIVES ARE: 1) DEFINE THE OPTIMAL SYSTEM TO KNOCKDOWN MRNA EXPRESSION IN CRISPR-RFXCAS13D TRANSGENIC ZEBRAFISH. 2) KNOCKDOWN MRNA EXPRESSION IN A TISSUE-SPECIFIC MANNER USING SPECIFIC TRANSGENIC LINES. THIS PROPOSAL IS CONCEPTUALLY INNOVATIVE AS IT IS BASED ON THE EXPLORATION OF A NOVEL TECHNIQUE, CRISPR-RFXCAS13D, TO KNOCKDOWN MRNA IN A TISSUE-SPECIFIC MANNER IN ZEBRAFISH. THIS APPROACH HAS NEVER BEEN DONE IN VERTEBRATE MODEL SYSTEMS WHERE RNAI DOES NOT WORK. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE THE FIRST TRANSGENIC SYSTEM TO DISSECT AND STUDY GENE FUNCTION BY KNOCKING DOWN MRNA EXPRESSION IN ZEBRAFISH.

HOWEVER, EDITING THE ENDOGENOUS ZEBRAFISH GENES TO MODEL MISSENSE MUTATIONS OR OTHER DISCRETE HUMAN VARIANTS REMAINS CHALLENGING. PRIME EDITING (PE) IS A BREAKTHROUGH CAS9-BASED APPLICATION FOR THE CREATION OF ANIMAL AND CELL-BASED MODELS OF DISEASE AND FOR DEVELOPING TREATMENTS OF HUMAN GENETIC DISEASES BECAUSE IT ENABLES PRECISE GENOME EDITING SUCH AS BASE SUBSTITUTIONS, SMALL INSERTIONS, AND DELETIONS.

STUDYING MECHANISMS OF REGENERATION IN AXOLOTL PROVIDES A ROADMAP FOR ENGINEERING SIMILAR REGENERATION MECHANISMS IN MAMMALS AND ULTIMATELY HUMANS. TWO KEY QUESTIONS IN REGENERATION BIOLOGY THAT REMAIN INCOMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD ARE: (1). WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF REPLACEMENT CELLS DURING INJURY REPAIR? AND (2). HOW DO CELLS INTERACT DURING REGENERATION TO CREATE COMPLEX TISSUES THAT FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE ORIGINAL ORGANS? OUR WORK ON GENERATING TRANSGENIC AXOLOTL HAS BROUGHT THIS CLASSICAL SYSTEM INTO THE MODERN GENOMIC ERA WHERE WE CAN NOW LINEAGE TRACE CELLS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO REGENERATION AND START TO TEASE APART SPECIFIC REGENERATION MECHANISMS IN DIFFERENT ORGANS. HOWEVER, TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CONTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AND LINEAGES TO REGENERATION, CELL ABLATION APPROACHES ARE REQUIRED. CELL ABLATION ALLOWS US TO ASK QUESTIONS SUCH AS: WHAT IS THE ROLE OF A SPECIFIC CELL TYPE IN A COMPLEX MIXTURE OF CELLS DURING REGENERATION? IS A CERTAIN CELL TYPE NECESSARY FOR ORGAN/APPENDAGE REGENERATION? CAN OTHER CELLS ACT AS A RESERVE POOL WHEN THE CELL TYPE THAT NORMALLY PARTICIPATES IN THE REGENERATIVE PROCESS IS MISSING?

TO ANSWER THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS, WE PROPOSE GENERATING BROADLY APPLICABLE TRANSGENIC AXOLOTL TOOLS FOR LINEAGE SPECIFIC CELL ABLATION STUDIES.

TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE WILL USE A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH. FIRST, WE WILL USE DIETARY ADDITIVES TO INCREASE CRYOPROTECTANTS IN FLY EMBRYOS. SECOND, WE WILL OPTIMIZE METHODS FOR USING SONOPORATION TO FURTHER AUGMENT CRYOPROTECTIVE MOLECULES AND LOAD EMBRYOS WITH LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN(S) (LEAPS), A CLASS OF PROTEINS THAT PROTECT AGAINST OSMOTIC STRESS AND PROMOTE FREEZE TOLERANCE.

XIPHOPHORUS FISH EXHIBIT SEVERAL FEATURES THAT NO OTHER ANIMAL MODELS SHARE, INCLUDING A HIGH LEVEL OF INTER-SPECIES GENETIC DIVERGENCE, THE CAPABILITY OF PRODUCING INTER-SPECIES AND BACKCROSS HYBRIDS, AND ADAPTIVE PHENOTYPES REPRESENTING SEVERAL HUMAN DISEASES. XIPHOPHORUS IS AN EVOLUTIONARY MUTANT MODEL THAT IS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO SEARCH FOR DISEASE-MODIFYING FACTORS.

THESE DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS ARE HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH RISK OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY; HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH THEY OCCUR REMAIN UNCLEAR. PREVIOUS WORK SUGGESTED THAT INFLAMMATORY NEUTROPHILS ACCUMULATE, ARE HYPERACTIVATED, AND HAVE PROLONGED SURVIVAL CAPABILITIES IN THE GI TRACT DURING SIV/HIV INFECTION. ADDITIONALLY, PRIOR STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT ALTERATIONS IN NEUTROPHIL FUNCTION ASSOCIATES WITH MALARIA PATHOGENESIS. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF NEUTROPHILS IN MUCOSAL DYSFUNCTION AND RISK FOR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF HIV/MALARIA CO-INFECTION HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. OUR GLOBAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MALARIA CO-INFECTION OF SIV-INFECTED RHESUS MACAQUES WILL RESULT IN INCREASED NEUTROPHIL ACCUMULATION AND HYPERACTIVITY IN THE GI TRACT, WHICH WILL LEAD TO ELEVATED IMMUNE ACTIVATION, EPITHELIAL BARRIER DYSFUNCTION AND MICROBIAL TRANSLOCATION. IN THE PROPOSED PROJECT, WE AIM TO LONGITUDINALLY ASSESS NEUTROPHIL KINETICS AND FUNCTION THROUGHOUT MALARIA INFECTION OF SIV-INFECTED RHESUS MACAQUES. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL CHARACTERIZE THE ROLE OF NEUTROPHILS IN EXACERBATED MUCOSAL IMMUNE ACTIVATION, BARRIER INTEGRITY, AND MICROBIAL TRANSLOCATION IN SIV/MALARIA CO-INFECTED MACAQUES. FINALLY, WE WILL UTILIZE IN VITRO CO-CULTURE SYSTEMS TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF NEUTROPHIL TARGETING STRATEGIES TO LIMIT INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES AND RESTORE BARRIER INTEGRITY. IN SUM, THESE STUDIES WILL GENERATE CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPACT OF MALARIA CO-INFECTION ON SIV-ASSOCIATED IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION. MOREOVER, THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR FUTURE PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES TARGETING NEUTROPHILS TO REDUCE INTESTINAL INFLAMMATION AND RESTORE MUCOSAL HOMEOSTASIS.

NATURAL HOSTS OF SIV CIRCUMVENT DISEASE PROGRESSION IN SPITE OF ONGOING VIREMIA AND HAVE EVOLVED TO NATURALLY REGULATE HIV-1/SIV ENTRY RECEPTORS.

HOWEVER, THE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING FIELD OF GENOME ENGINEERING HAS PROMISED PERMANENT, CURATIVE OPTIONS FOR A MULTITUDE OF GENETIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS METABOLIC LIVER DISEASES, EPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA, AND SICKLE CELL DISEASE. THE ABILITY TO MANIPULATE THE GENOME HAS ALSO LED TO BETTER DISEASE MODELS, MORE ROBUST CONTROL OVER CELLULAR FATE, AND HIGH-RESOLUTION MAPS OF CELLULAR DYNAMICS DURING EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT. INDEED, NEARLY ALL BIOSCIENTIFIC AND BIOMEDICAL FIELDS HAVE BENEFITED GREATLY FROM ADVANCES IN GENOME ENGINEERING. HOWEVER, THE TOOLS USED TO MODIFY THE GENOME ARE IMPERFECT AND STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS ROOM TO INCREASE EDITING EFFICIENCY, DECREASE OFF-TARGET EFFECTS, AND IMPROVE ON-TARGET FIDELITY. THE COMBINATION OF CAS9 AND ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS-6 (AAV6) HAS PROVEN TO BE HIGHLY EFFICIENT FOR SITE-SPECIFIC GENOME EDITING. CAS9 INDUCES A DOUBLE-STRANDED BREAK AT A TARGET GENOMIC SITE, WHILE AAV6 DELIVERS SINGLE- STRANDED DNA REPAIR TEMPLATES INTO THE NUCLEUS. SINCE AAV IS A VIRUS, IT HAS EVOLVED TO DELIVER DNA INTO CELL NUCLEI IN A MANNER MORE EFFICIENT THAN MOST OTHER TRANSFECTION PROTOCOLS. THE CELL THEN EMPLOYS ITS ENDOGENOUS HOMOLOGY-DIRECTED REPAIR MACHINERY TO FIX THE CAS9-INDUCED BREAK, USING THE AAV6-DELIVERED DNA AS A REPAIR TEMPLATE. THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN USED TO MAKE BOTH SMALL CHANGES AND LARGE INSERTIONS IN THE GENOME OF CELLS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO. FOR THESE REASONS, AAV IS THE VECTOR-OF-CHOICE IN OVER 100 CLINICAL TRIALS WORLDWIDE. WE RECENTLY GENERATED DATA THAT QUESTIONS THE FIDELITY OF TARGET-SITE GENOME MODIFICATIONS WHEN USING AAV6 TO DELIVER THE REPAIR TEMPLATE. USING A COMPREHENSIVE AND SENSITIVE ASSAY FOR DETECTING REGIONS OF DNA, WE FOUND THAT NEARLY HALF OF THE EDITED CELLS HAD ADDITIONAL, UNEXPECTED GENOMIC INSERTS OF THE TEMPLATE.

MRI HAS BEEN USED NOT ONLY TO ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, BUT ALSO AGING, CANCER, ADDICTION, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY\u2019S DESIRE FOR EMULATING CLINICAL TRIALS AND PERFORMING HIGH-THROUGHPUT STUDIES, AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF MRI IN ANIMAL MODELS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LAGGED STATE-OF-THE-ART TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE ANALYSIS OF HUMAN IMAGING.

BRIGGSAE RESEARCH - GENETIC AND GENOMIC TOOLS FOR C. BRIGGSAE RESEARCH: PROJECT SUMMARY RESEARCH USING THE MICROSCOPIC NEMATODE CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS HAS PRODUCED MANY FOUNDATIONAL DISCOVERIES IN THE GENETIC BASIS OF CELL DEATH, ORGANISMAL AGING, THE BIOLOGICAL ROLES FOR MICRORNAS, AS WELL AS OTHER FUNDAMENTAL TOPICS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO HUMAN HEALTH. AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENT TO STUDIES ON C. ELEGANS IS THOSE ON THE RELATED NEMATODE CAENORHABDITIS BRIGGSAE, WHICH SHARES MANY OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STRENGTHS OF C. ELEGANS, BUT FROM WHICH IT DIVERGED APPROXIMATELY 30 MILLION YEARS AGO. C. BRIGGSAE PROVIDES A PLATFORM FOR COMPARATIVE GENETIC STUDIES, LEADING TO EFFICIENT ANALYSIS OF CONSERVED PROCESSES, AS WELL AS DISCOVERIES ON THE EVOLUTION OF GENES, PATHWAYS AND NETWORKS. THESE COMPARATIVE STUDIES ARE IMPORTANT IN ESTABLISHING RESEARCH RIGOR AND VALIDATING FINDINGS. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN C. ELEGANS AND C. BRIGGSAE IN TERMS OF LIFE HISTORY TRAITS AND GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATIONS MEANS THAT MANY STUDIES ADDRESSING POPULATION BIOLOGY QUESTIONS, POLYGENIC TRAITS, OR HOST-PATHOGEN, COMMENSAL, AND OPPORTUNISTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH VIRUSES, BACTERIA, AND INSECTS ARE BETTER DONE WITH C. BRIGGSAE THAN WITH C. ELEGANS. DESPITE THESE IMPORTANT FEATURES, MANY GENETIC RESOURCES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR STANDARD C. ELEGANS RESEARCH ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR STUDIES USING C. BRIGGSAE. WITH THE INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF GENETIC EDITING AND ENGINEERING USING CRISPR-MEDIATED METHODS, THE AVAILABILITY OF IMPORTANT GENOMIC AND GENETIC TOOLS IS A KEY LIMITATION FOR THESE IMPORTANT COMPARATIVE STUDIES. THIS PROJECT WILL PRODUCE THESE RESEARCH RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS GAP. AS A FIRST AIM, TWO TELOMERE-TO- TELOMERE C. BRIGGSAE REFERENCE GENOMES WITH VALIDATED GENE MODELS WILL BE PRODUCED, USING SETS OF COMPLEMENTARY LONG AND SHORT SEQUENCE READ METHODS AND VALIDATION TECHNIQUES. THESE DATA WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO NCBI AND WORMBASE, THE ONLINE DATABASE USED BY RESEARCHERS WHO USE C. ELEGANS AND RELATED NEMATODES. A SECOND AIM WILL PRODUCE AND VALIDATE A SET OF GENETIC BALANCERS, OR REARRANGED CHROMOSOMES THAT PREVENT MEIOTIC CROSSING OVER. THESE GENETIC TOOLS ARE CRITICAL FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND EVALUATION OF MUTATIONS THAT ARE HOMOZYGOUS LETHAL OR STERILE AND THAT ARE CURRENTLY MAINTAINED THROUGH LABORIOUS PROCESSES. GENETIC BALANCERS WILL ALSO PERMIT MORE COMPLEX GENETIC EXPERIMENTS NOT CURRENTLY FEASIBLE IN C. BRIGGSAE. FINALLY, STRAINS WITH \"SAFE HARBOR\" LANDING SITES FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF DNA INTO DEFINED LOCATIONS IN THE C. BRIGGSAE GENOME WILL BE PRODUCED AND VALIDATED. THESE STRAINS WILL PERMIT CONTROLLED, REPRODUCIBLE INTRODUCTION OF SINGLE COPY INSERTION CLONES INTO C. BRIGGSAE, AND PERMIT A RANGE OF EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION INCLUDING GENE \"NODE SWAPS\" BETWEEN THE TWO SPECIES, AND THE TESTING OF REAGENTS DEVELOPED FOR C. ELEGANS DIRECTLY IN C. BRIGGSAE.

MULTIPLE SIGNALING PATHWAYS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED TO BE REGULATED THROUGH THE CILIA, INCLUDING HEDGEHOG, WNT, NOTCHED, AND PDGF. MUTATIONS THAT AFFECT CILIARY COMPONENTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A MULTITUDE OF HUMAN DISEASES, TOGETHER CALLED CILIOPATHIES. THE MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT RESULT FROM CILIARY DYSFUNCTION INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, RETINAL DEGENERATION, ANOSMIA, NEURAL TUBE CLOSURE, POLYDACTYLY, CARDIAC MALFORMATIONS, OBESITY, POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND CANCER. CILIOPATHIES INCLUDE RARE HUMAN DISORDERS SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, MECKEL SYNDROME (MKS), JOUBERT SYNDROME (JBTS), NEPHRONOPHTHISIS (NPHP), AND BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME (BBS). WITH HOPES OF TREATING THESE DISEASES AND DISORDERS IT IS IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND HOW CILIARY DYSFUNCTION CONTRIBUTES TO THE PATHOLOGY OF DISEASE. WHILE MANY OF THE STRUCTURAL ASPECTS OF CILIA CAN BE STUDIES IN CELL CULTURE, TO UNDERSTAND THE PATHOLOGY ANIMAL MODELS ARE REQUIRED. ZEBRAFISH IS A POWERFUL MODEL FOR STUDYING HUMAN DISEASE AND CILIOPATHIES; HOWEVER, THEY HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LIMITED TO MORPHOLINO KNOCKDOWN. WE HAVE RECENTLY GENERATED A NUMBER ZYGOTIC KNOCKOUT IN CILIA ASSOCIATED GENES, AND DISCOVERED A NUMBER OF DISEASE PHENOTYPES. HOWEVER MANY OF THESE KNOCKOUTS ARE EMBRYONIC LETHAL PREVENTING ANALYSES OF ADULT DISEASE PHENOTYPES. FOR THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS, THERE IS A NEED FOR ZEBRAFISH CONDITIONAL KNOCKOUTS. FURTHER, A CONDITIONAL KNOCKOUT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE A TOOL FOR EMBRYONIC ANALYSIS AS FAR AS CELL OF ORIGIN OF A PHENOTYPES OR ISOLATION OF ONE PHENOTYPE OUTSIDE THE CONTEXT OF MULTIPLE PHENOTYPES. HOWEVER, THE GENERATION OF ZEBRAFISH CONDITIONAL ALLELES ARE TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING AND CUMBERSOME TO MAKE.

IT IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF AUTOIMMUNE BLISTERING DISEASE AND IS OVERREPRESENTED IN THE ELDERLY. TREATMENT FOR BULLOUS PEMPHIGOID RELIES ON THE USE OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSION, WHICH GIVEN THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF MEDICAL COMORBIDITIES IN THIS GROUP, RESULTS IN ONE-YEAR MORTALITY RATES RANGING FROM 13% TO 27%. BULLOUS PEMPHIGOID IS CAUSED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST COLLAGEN XVII LEADING TO BLISTER FORMATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFLAMMATION. LOSS OF SELF-TOLERANCE TO COLLAGEN XVII, ESPECIALLY IN THE AGING IMMUNE SYSTEM, IS THOUGHT TO LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT OF BP. PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND PRE-EXISTING PRURITUS BOTH INDEPENDENTLY IMPOSE STRONG PREDISPOSITION TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF BULLOUS PEMPHIGOID, LIKELY THROUGH AUTOINOCULATION WITH COLLAGEN XVII. UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISM OF COLLAGEN XVII AUTOINOCULATION NOT ONLY PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE PATHOGENESIS OF BULLOUS PEMPHIGOID, BUT OFFERS SIGNIFICANT INSIGHT INTO THE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE. WE PROPOSE TWO DISCRETE HYPOTHESES, 1) THAT SCRATCHING INDUCED SKIN BARRIER DAMAGE OR 2) NEUROINFLAMMATION SEEN IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE ARE SUFFICIENT TO AUTOINOCULATE COLLAGEN XVII IN A TOLERANT WITH MINIMAL T-CELL TOLERANCE. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE PROPOSE UTILIZING A NOVEL ANIMAL MODEL. WE HAVE USED CRISPR-CAS9 TO DEVELOP A MOUSE EXPRESSING A LOXP-POLYA-LOXP SEQUENCE UPSTREAM OF EXON 18, THE CODING REGION OF THE NC15A DOMAIN OF COLLAGEN XVII. THIS DOMAIN CORRESPONDS WITH THE HUMAN NC16A DOMAIN, WHICH SERVES AS THE PRINCIPLE AUTOANTIGEN IN BP. WHEN CROSSED TO A TAMOXIFEN INDUCIBLE CRE-LOX MOUSE MODEL, RESTORATION OF COLLAGEN XVII EXPRESSION OCCURS IN EARLY ADULTHOOD, BYPASSING T-CELL TOLERANCE ONCE UNMASKED. WITH INFLAMMATION AND ANTIGEN UNMASKING THROUGH SCRATCHING OR EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED PARKINSON'S DISEASE, WE ANTICIPATE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CD4+ T-CELLS AND AUTOANTIBODIES AGAINST COLLAGEN XVII. TWO SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED: 1) DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF SCRATCHING BEHAVIORS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTI- COLLAGEN XVII AUTOANTIBODIES, ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CD4+ T-CELLS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF BP. 2) DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF NEUROINFLAMMATION IN EXPERIMENTAL PARKINSONISM IN INDUCING CUTANEOUS AUTOIMMUNITY AGAINST COLLAGEN XVII. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INSIGHT INTO BOTH THE ROLE OF SCRATCHING AND NEUROINFLAMMATION IN ANTIGEN UNMASKING. THIS PROPOSAL IS LIKELY TO HAVE STRONG TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL ACROSS SEVERAL DISEASE PROCESSES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS.

GENETIC ANALYSIS AND DISEASE MODELING - PROJECT SUMMARY RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTAL USE OF PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS HAS EXPANDED RAPIDLY, AND THESE CELLS NOW PROVIDE IMPORTANT RESEARCH MODELS OF HUMAN DISEASE AND PERSONALIZED REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF RESEARCH TO DATE THAT HAS UTILIZED STEM CELLS HAS EMPLOYED GENETICALLY-LIMITED MURINE CELLS OR CLONAL HUMAN CELL LINES WITH LITTLE ATTENTION PAID TO THE IMPACT OF CELLULAR GENETIC DIVERSITY ON THE PHENOTYPIC AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AND ITS RELEVANCE TO HUMAN DIVERSITY. IMPORTANTLY, RECENT DATA FROM MURINE AND HUMAN STUDIES OF PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS INDICATE THAT GENETIC VARIABILITY IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR DIFFERENCES IN PHENOTYPE, INCLUDING THE EASE OF ESTABLISHMENT OF PLURIPOTENT CELL LINES, THE RATE OF SPONTANEOUS DIFFERENTIATION, REPROGRAMMING DIFFERENTIATED CELLS TO A PLURIPOTENT STATE, AND THE FUTURE USE OF STEM CELLS AS PERSONALIZED THERAPEUTICS. THUS, THERE IS NOW AN UNMET NEED, NOT RIGOROUSLY ADDRESSED AT CURRENT CONFERENCES, TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF GENETIC VARIATION ON STEM CELL BIOLOGY AND THEIR IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT. TO FILL THIS GAP, WE PROPOSE THE UNIQUE AND TIMELY CONFERENCE \u201cDIVERSITY IN A DISH: PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS IN GENETIC ANALYSIS AND DISEASE MODELING\u201d TO FACILITATE INTERDISCIPLINARY INTERACTIONS AND COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN EXPERTS IN MOUSE AND HUMAN GENETICS, CELL BIOLOGY, AND PLURIPOTENCY, AND TO ENGAGE DIVERSE LEARNERS WHO ARE THE NEXT GENERATION OF STEM CELL RESEARCHERS. WE PROPOSE AN ANNUAL, INTENSIVE 3-DAY CONFERENCE BEGINNING IN 2023 AT THE JACKSON LABORATORY IN BAR HARBOR, ME. WE WILL BRING TOGETHER 50 SCIENTISTS, SPANNING CAREER STAGES, FROM THE FIELDS OF GENETICS, CELL BIOLOGY, AND PLURIPOTENCY, AS WELL AS PROVIDE A VIRTUAL ATTENDANCE OPTION FOR THOSE THAT CANNOT OR CHOOSE NOT TO ATTEND IN PERSON. FOR AIM 1, WE WILL CONVENE AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SYMPOSIUM ORGANIZED AROUND CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH SEMINARS, WORKSHOPS THAT FOCUS ON TECHNICAL SKILL ACQUISITION, AND RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY AS APPLIED TO STEM CELL RESEARCH AND GENOMIC ANALYSES. IN AIM 2, WE WILL PROMOTE INTERACTIVE AND INCLUSIVE ACTIVITIES, TO PROMOTE NETWORKING, MENTORSHIP, LEARNER INVOLVEMENT, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH, AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE TRAINEE PRESENTATIONS AND SHORT TALKS, AND EVENING DISCUSSIONS FOCUSED ON RESEARCH PROJECTS, RIGOR AND ETHICS, AND GRANTSMANSHIP. THESE OBJECTIVES ARE FACILITATED BY THE RESIDENTIAL NATURE OF THE JAX HIGHSEAS CONFERENCE CENTER. IN AIM 3, WE WILL PROMOTE DIVERSITY IN BOTH THE RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS AND IN THE TOOLS BEING GENERATED TO STUDY MODELS OF HUMAN DISEASE. DIVERSE ATTENDEES WILL BE ACTIVELY RECRUITED, SCHOLARSHIPS WILL BE PROVIDED TO ENABLE IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE, AND AN INCLUSIVE VIRTUAL OPTION WILL ENABLE PARTICIPATION BY THOSE THAT ARE UNABLE TO TRAVEL. DIVERSITY WILL ALSO BE EMPHASIZED IN THE CONTEXT OF BEST PRACTICES FOR RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE NEED FOR STUDIES OF GENETICALLY DIVERSE PANELS OF STEM CELLS, AND FAIR ACQUISITION, REPRESENTATION, AND DISTRIBUTION OF CELL LINES FROM WIDER REPRESENTATION OF BACKGROUNDS TO ENSURE THE BENEFITS DISCOVERED FROM THESE BIOMEDICAL RESOURCES ARE SHARED EQUITABLY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "ME", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "023bc6ff-e791-fc8c-47cb-ebca0c5a7fa7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R13OD034182_7529"}, {"internal_id": 150745952, "Award ID": "R13OD034052", "Award Amount": 149998.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-04", "CFDA Number": "93.351", "Description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

PRIMARY MYELOFIBROSIS (PMF) BELONGS TO THE GROUP OF MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASMS (MPNS), THE FOURTH MOST PREVALENT HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCY. IN THE UNITED STATES, ~100,000 PEOPLE ARE LIVING WITH OR IN REMISSION FROM MPNS. THE MOST FREQUENT DRIVER MUTATION IS JAK2V617F. JAK2 INHIBITOR RUXOLITINIB REMARKABLY ALLEVIATES CONSTITUTIVE SYMPTOMS, BUT DOES NOT PROLONG SURVIVAL OR REVERSE DISEASE, WHICH PROGRESSES TO MYELOFIBROSIS OR TRANSFORMS TO ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA. MOUSE MODELS AND PATIENT DATA SUGGEST THAT THIS SHORTCOMING IS DUE TO ITS INABILITY TO TARGET THE JAK2V617F+ STEM CELL. THIS APPLICATION ADDRESSES THE URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP TREATMENTS THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGET JAK2V617F+ STEM CELLS TO IMPROVE THE LONG-TERM OUTCOME OF CURRENT THERAPIES. PREVIOUS WORK ON THE SERCA K01 AWARD REVEALED DE-REGULATED EXPRESSION OF INTEGRINS, ADHESION MOLECULES THAT INTEGRATE THE EXTRACELLULAR ENVIRONMENT WITH THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON, IN MEGAKARYOCYTES OF JAK2V617F TRANSGENIC MICE AND PMF PATIENTS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT 1 INTEGRIN IS A KEY MEDIATOR OF JAK2V617F+ STEM CELL MAINTENANCE IN PMF. IN OUR MOST RECENT PRELIMINARY STUDIES, WE FOUND HIGHER ACTIVATION OF 1 INTEGRIN IN STEM CELLS OF JAK2V617F TRANSGENIC MICE COMPARED TO WILD-TYPE (WT) CONTROLS. TREATMENT WITH AN ANTI-1 INTEGRIN INHIBITORY ANTIBODY HM1-1 IN VIVO WAS ABLE TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF JAK2V617F+ STEM CELLS, WITH NEGLIGIBLE EFFECT ON WT ANIMALS. HOWEVER, IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES THE JAK2V617F+ STEM CELLS PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO 1 INTEGRIN INHIBITION, AND WHETHER THE STEM CELL REDUCTION PERSISTS LONG-TERM. AIM 1 OF THIS PROPOSAL, OF MECHANISTIC SIGNIFICANCE, WILL DEFINE HOW THE ANTI-1 INTEGRIN ANTIBODY HM1-1 REDUCES JAK2V617F+ STEM CELLS IN VIVO, BY ADDRESSING TWO HYPOTHESES: 1) THAT INDUCTION OF CELL CYCLE LEADS JAK2V617F+ STEM CELLS TO EXIT QUIESCENCE AND DIFFERENTIATE, AND 2) THAT HM1-1 INDUCES APOPTOSIS AND CELL DEATH IN JAK2V617F+ STEM CELLS. AIM 2, OF TRANSLATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE, WILL ADDRESS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT JAK2V617F+ STEM CELL REDUCTION UPON HM1-1 TREATMENT PERSISTS LONG-TERM, AND WILL LEAD TO REDUCTION OF ALL PROGENY DERIVED FROM JAK2V617F+ STEM CELLS. STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED ON JAK2V617F TRANSGENIC MICE, CARRYING THE HUMAN MUTATION, USING STATE-OF-ART FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS. IMPORTANTLY, DESPITE ITS ESSENTIAL ROLE IN ORGANISM DEVELOPMENT, CONDITIONAL DELETION OF 1 INTEGRIN IN HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS OF ADULT MICE DID NOT AFFECT BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION OR MAINTENANCE OF STEM CELLS. IN CONTRAST, AS OUR DATA SUGGEST, JAK2V617F+ STEM CELLS SEEM TO BE PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT ON INTEGRIN SIGNALING AND HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO ITS INHIBITION, OFFERING A POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITY WINDOW. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE UNMET NEED OF IDENTIFYING A MOLECULAR TARGET SPECIFIC TO JAK2V617F+ STEM CELLS WITH POTENTIAL FOR THERAPEUTIC DEVELOPMENT.

UP TO 30% OF THOSE DIAGNOSED WILL NOT SURVIVE 5 YEARS WITH CURRENT, MULTIMODAL THERAPY WHICH INCLUDES SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY AND, IN SOME CASES, RADIATION THERAPY. NO MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS IN SURVIVAL TIMES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST 40 YEARS, ILLUSTRATING THE DESPERATE NEED FOR NOVEL FORMS OF THERAPY.  THE CORE BINDING FACTOR BETA (CBFSS) PROTEIN IS ONE SUBUNIT OF A HETERODIMERIC TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR COMPLEX THAT BINDS TO RUNT-RELATED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2 (RUNX2) TO COORDINATE ORGANIZED SKELETAL DEVELOPMENT. BOTH COMPONENTS ARE OVEREXPRESSED IN OS AND THEIR NORMAL ACTIVITY IS DYSREGULATED. WITH NO INHERENT DNA BINDING NOR TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY OF ITS OWN, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ACTIVITY OF CYTOPLASMIC CBFSS. YET, THIS PROTEIN IS UPREGULATED IN OS, DEMONSTRATES INCREASED EXPRESSION IN METASTATIC LESIONS, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED DISEASE FREE AND OVERALL SURVIVAL. CBFSS APPEARS TO CONTROL RUNX2 EXPRESSION THROUGH POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL MECHANISMS INDEPENDENT OF RUNX2 PROTEIN STABILITY OR PROTEASOMAL DEGREDATION. RECENTLY, CBFSS HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN REGULATING THE INITIATION OF PROTEIN TRANSLATION IN BREAST CANCER CELLS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE A NONCANONICAL, REGULATORY ROLE OF CBFSS IN INITIATING CAP-DEPENDENT PROTEIN TRANSLATION IN OS, A PROCESS TO WHICH MALIGNANT CELLS ARE THOUGHT TO BE ADDICTED. THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF A CBFSS KNOCKOUT CELLS TRANSFECTED WITH EITHER WILD-TYPE CBFSS OR ASITE-DIRECTED MUTANT OF CBFSS THAT TARGETS THE BINDING SITE WITH RUNX2. AN INHIBITORY PEPTIDE WILL BE USED IN ADDITIONAL OS CELL LINES AND NORMAL OSTEOBLAST CELLS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROJECT WILL 1) DETERMINE THE MECHANISM OF POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL OF RUNX2 PROTEIN EXPRESSION BY CBFSS AND 2) IDENTIFY THE CONTRIBUTION OF CBFSS TO CAP-DEPENDENT PROTEIN TRANSLATION IN OSTEOSARCOMA.  DE NOVO PROTEIN SYNTHESIS ASSAYS, INVESTIGATION OF CBFSS INTERACTIONS WITH TRANSLATIONAL MACHINERY PROTEINS, AND THE ABILITY CBFSS TO INFLUENCE RNA-BINDING AND CAP-BINDING PROTEIN INTERACTIONS WITH RUNX2 MRNA WILL BE USED TO UNCOVER POTENTIAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH CBFSS EXERTS POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL OF RUNX2. RIBOSOME FOOTPRINTING, OR RIBO-SEQ, COMBINED WITH RNA-SEQ WILL IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF CBFSS ON TRANSLATIONAL EFFICIENCY OF RUNX2 AND RUNX2-TARGET GENE PRODUCTS. RIBO-SEQ DATA WILL ALSO PROVIDE A GLOBAL VIEW OF THE INFLUENCE OF CBFSS ON PROTEIN TRANSLATION, AND SUBSEQUENT PATHWAY ANALYSIS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL NOVEL TARGETS IN OS.

THESE PATIENTS INCLUDE THOSE WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ORGAN TRANSPLANTS, AND PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES. PROPHYLACTIC PV VACCINES DEVELOPED TO TARGET MUCOSAL PVS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AGAINST CUTANEOUS PVS, AND TREATMENTS ARE LIMITED AND OFTEN INEFFECTIVE. THUS, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO IDENTIFY TARGETED THERAPEUTICS FOR TREATMENT OF CUTANEOUS PV INFECTIONS AND PV-ASSOCIATED SKIN CANCERS. EPIDERMODYSPLASIA VERRUCIFORMIS (EV), A GENODERMATOSIS, OFFERS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY MECHANISMS OF CELL INTRINSIC HOST DEFENSE AGAINST PV IN THE SKIN, AS THESE PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO CUTANEOUS PV INFECTIONS BUT HAVE NO INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO OTHER INFECTIONS. A RECENT STUDY IDENTIFIED A COHORT OF EV PATIENTS WITH NULL MUTATIONS WITHIN CALCIUM- AND INTEGRIN-BINDING PROTEIN-1 (CIB1), AS WELL AS DECREASED CIB1 EXPRESSION IN EV-PATIENTS WITH OTHER, MORE COMMON, MUTATIONS THAT AFFECT ~50% OF EV PATIENTS. COLLECTIVELY, THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CIB1 IS A KEY PLAYER IN IMMUNITY TO CUTANEOUS PV INFECTIONS AND MAY ACT AS A RESTRICTION FACTOR AGAINST CUTANEOUS PVS. EV, THOUGH, IS A RARE DISEASE AND THUS OBTAINING CLINICAL SPECIMENS FOR EVALUATION AND FUTURE THERAPEUTIC TESTING IS PROBLEMATIC. WE HAVE, HOWEVER, DISCOVERED A NATURALLY OCCURRING EV-LIKE DISEASE IN DOGS WHICH APPEARS TO MIMIC THE HUMAN DISEASE IN SEVERAL CRITICAL ASPECTS: A) LIKE HUMANS WITH EV, AFFECTED DOGS ACQUIRE DISSEMINATED CUTANEOUS PV INFECTIONS THAT ARE REFRACTORY TO TREATMENT AND CAN PROGRESS TO CANCER; B) LIKE HUMANS, THESE DOGS HAVE RESTRICTED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CUTANEOUS PV INFECTION; AND C) LIKE HUMANS, THE DISEASE OCCURS SPONTANEOUSLY. WE PROPOSE THE DOG AS A MODEL FOR STUDYING PV INFECTIONS IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS. THIS COULD BE THE MOST VALUABLE ANIMAL MODEL TO DATE TO STUDY NOT ONLY THE UNDERLYING PATHOGENESIS OF EV, BUT ALSO IDENTIFY CONSERVED MECHANISMS OF INTRINSIC KERATINOCYTE DEFENSE AGAINST PV INFECTIONS. IMPORTANTLY, PRELIMINARY STUDIES FROM OUR LABORATORY HAVE DEMONSTRATED DECREASED EXPRESSION OF CIB1 IN KERATINOCYTES FROM EV-LIKE DOGS, HIGHLIGHTING A CONSERVED MECHANISM UNDERLYING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PV INFECTIONS BETWEEN HUMANS AND DOGS, LINKED TO CIB1. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT IMPAIRED CIB1 EXPRESSION ENHANCES PV REPLICATION AND TRANSCRIPTION IN KERATINOCYTES IN BOTH HUMANS AND DOGS WITH EV. IN AIM 1, WE WILL DETERMINE IF CIB1 EXPRESSION IN IMPAIRED IN DOGS WITH EV-LIKE DISEASE, AND IN HUMANS AND DOGS WITH ANOTHER FORM OF EV CAUSED BY IL2RG MUTATIONS.

MODELS FOR HUMAN DISEASE AND FOR GAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ANIMAL BIOLOGY. TARGETED MODIFICATION OF THE ANIMAL GENOME ALLOWS THE ANIMALS TO PRESENT HUMAN DISEASE PHENOTYPES, AND THEREFORE, ARE CRITICAL TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP NOVEL TREATMENTS. THE USE OF GE LARGE ANIMAL MODELS SUCH AS PIGS OFTEN RESULTS IN CLINICALLY RELEVANT OUTCOMES AS THEIR PHYSIOLOGY AND ANATOMY RESEMBLE HUMANS. FOR EXAMPLE, INTRODUCING GENETIC ELEMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND IMMUNODEFICIENCY TO THE PIG GENOME INDUCES GE PIGS TO CLOSELY RECAPITULATE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASES. HOWEVER, GE PIGS ARE NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE IN BIOMEDICINE DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH SUCH MODELS. AS A LARGE ANIMAL SPECIES, A SINGLE ROUND OF BREEDING IN PIGS TAKES AT LEAST ONE YEAR AND OFTEN MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF BREEDING IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH GE PIG MODELS. APPLICATION OF GENOME EDITING TOOLS, SUCH AS THE CRISPR/CAS SYSTEM, HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED EFFICACY TO INTRODUCE TARGETED MODIFICATIONS TO THE PIG GENOME. HOWEVER, CONCERNS OVER UNINTENDED GENOME ALTERATIONS FROM GENOME EDITING PROCEDURE AND DAYS REQUIRED TO INTRODUCE TARGETED MODIFICATIONS IN PIGS AS A LARGE ANIMAL MODEL IMPEDES WIDE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. OUR OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF GENOME EDITING TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN NOVEL APPROACHES THAT WILL ASSIST IN RAPID PHENOTYPING OF ANIMAL MODELS AFTER A TARGETED GENOME EDITING EVENT. THREE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED TO REACH OUR GOAL. FIRST, WE WILL GENERATE METHODS FOR GLOBAL DETECTION OF OFF-TARGETING EVENTS IN GE PIGS. SECONDLY, WE WILL DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO SECURE GENOME INTEGRITY DURING THE GENOME EDITING PROCESS. FINALLY, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO RAPIDLY PHENOTYPE GE FETUSES AND TO MODIFY THE GENOME OF WILD-TYPE PIGS. TARGETS OF THIS THIRD AIM ARE GENES ASSOCIATED WITH TRAITS THAT ARE RELEVANT IN BOTH AGRICULTURE AND BIOMEDICINE. THE KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED FROM THIS PROJECT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TO EXPAND THE USE OF GE PIGS IN BIOMEDICINE WHILE ALSO HAVING AN IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION. THE IMPORTANCE OF USING THE GENOME TO PREDICT THE PHENOTYPE FOR RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF IMPROVED ALLELES AND TRAITS WILL BE GROWN HERE. OUR EXPERTISE IN USING GENOME EDITING TECHNOLOGY AND GE PIG MODELS WILL BE EMPLOYED TO COMPLETE THE PROPOSED AIMS. OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT SHOULD INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF GE PIG MODELS IN BIOMEDICINE AND AGRICULTURE BY EFFECTIVELY CAPTURING SUBSEQUENT PHENOTYPES AFTER GENOME EDITING EVENTS. WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE PIGS AS A MODEL TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF THE PROPOSED STRATEGIES; HOWEVER, OUR FINDINGS SHOULD BE EASILY TRANSFERRED TO PRODUCING OTHER ANIMAL MODELS IN BIOMEDICINE AND AGRICULTURALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES, AS WELL.

POPULATION VARIATION IN THESE TRAITS HAS A SIZEABLE GENETIC COMPONENT, AND DISSECTING THIS VARIATION CAN YIELD IMPROVED DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPEUTICS, AND ENABLE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR PROCESSES UNDERLYING DISEASE AND TRAIT VARIATION.  GENOMEWIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWAS) ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DRAMATIC PROGRESS IN THE ANALYSIS OF HUMAN COMPLEX TRAITS IN RECENT YEARS. GWAS HAVE LINKED MANY GENES TO VARIATION IN HUMAN HEALTH, AND IMPLY A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF TRAIT VARIATION IS CONTROLLED BY THOUSANDS OF TINY-EFFECT, PRIMARILY REGULATORY SITES SPREAD ALONG THE GENOME. DESPITE THIS CRITICAL INSIGHT, THERE REMAIN MANY GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF CAUSATIVE LOCI. ONE NOTABLE CAVEAT OF THE GWAS APPROACH IS ITS INHERENT BIAS TOWARDS INTERMEDIATE- FREQUENCY ALLELES; GWAS ARE ILL-SUITED TO UNCOVERING RARE ALLELES OF LARGE EFFECT AND GENES HARBORING SEVERAL INDIVIDUALLY-RARE MUTATIONS, EVENTS THAT MUTATION-SELECTION BALANCE MODELS PREDICT CONTRIBUTE TO TRAIT VARIATION.  THE DISSECTION OF COMPLEX TRAITS IN MODEL ORGANISMS OFFERS GREAT EXPERIMENTAL FLEXIBILITY, AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEPLOY METHODS SYNERGISTIC WITH THE DOMINANT GWAS PARADIGM, YIELDING A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE GENETIC BASIS OF TRAIT VARIATION. WITH THIS IN MIND WE ESTABLISHED THE DSPR (DROSOPHILA SYNTHETIC POPULATION RESOURCE) AS A SHAREABLE TOOLKIT FOR COMPLEX TRAIT ANALYSIS IN FLIES. THE SET OF 1600 DSPR STRAINS WERE DERIVED FROM 15 HIGHLY-CHARACTERIZED FOUNDER GENOTYPES, AND REPRESENT THE MOST EXTENSIVE MULTIPARENTAL POPULATION (MPP) AVAILABLE IN ANIMALS. THE DSPR IS USED BY MANY RESEARCH GROUPS, HAS ENABLED THE IDENTIFICATION OF THOUSANDS OF QTL, AND HAS ASSOCIATED RARE ALLELES WITH TRAIT VARIATION. THE DSPR COMPLEMENTS GWAS APPROACHES FOR UNCOVERING THE FULL SPECTRUM OF ALLELIC VARIATION CONTRIBUTING TO COMPLEX TRAITS.  IN AIM 1 WE WILL VALIDATE AND REFINE THE GENOTYPES OF ALL DSPR STRAINS, STRENGTHENING THE LIVING RESOURCE WE WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE WITH THE DROSOPHILA COMMUNITY, AND ENHANCE THE USABILITY OF THE COLLECTION BY INTEGRATING ANALYTICAL ROUTINES INTO THE POWERFUL R/QTL2 SOFTWARE PLATFORM. IN AIM 2 WE WILL EXTEND THE DSPR, AND ENABLE EXTREME QTL (OR X-QTL) MAPPING. FOR MANY TRAITS, AN EFFICIENT AND USER-FRIENDLY STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY QTL IS TO COMPARE ALLELE FREQUENCIES IN PHENOTYPICALLY-EXTREME RECOMBINANT POPULATIONS TO THOSE IN CONTROL COHORTS. WE WILL DERIVE SUCH MIXED DSPR POPULATIONS, EXPERIMENTALLY REFINE OUR APPROACH, AND DISTRIBUTE POPULATIONS AND SOFTWARE TO FACILITATE NOVEL, INVESTIGATOR-DRIVEN RESEARCH.

USING A HOST-PATHOGEN MODEL, WE WILL EXPLOIT THE RAPID REGULATORY CHANGE THAT OCCURS DURING THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO DEVELOP DYNAMIC EQTL MAPPING METHODS, FINDING LOCI THAT CONTRIBUTE TO VARIATION IN THE TRAJECTORY OF THE REGULATORY REACTION.

INCREASING EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT CHRONIC SYSTEMIC IMMUNE ACTIVATION CONTRIBUTES TO NEUROINFLAMMATION, AND NEUROINFLAMMATION PROMOTES THE SEVERITY OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. INTRIGUINGLY, VIRAL-INDUCED NEUROINFLAMMATION HAS STRIKING SIMILARITIES TO NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE, AND CHRONIC INFECTION MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE. ONE FACTOR LINKED TO NEUROINFLAMMATION, NEURODEGENERATION, AND HOST IMMUNITY AGAINST MICROBIAL PATHOGENS IS THE IMMUNE KINASE LEUCINE RICH REPEAT KINASE 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2 HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN MODULATING ANTIVIRAL CYTOKINE ACTIVITY, CONFERRING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTION, AND MUTATED LRRK2 IS THE MOST COMMON MONOGENETIC CAUSE OF THE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDER PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO EXTEND THE OBSERVATION THAT LRRK2 MODULATES ANTIVIRAL IMMUNITY DURING BACTERIAL INFECTION TO DETERMINE THE FUNCTION OF LRRK2 IN VIRAL PATHOGENESIS AND NEUROINFLAMMATION AND ASSESS ITS THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL. USING A MACAQUE SIV INFECTION MODEL FOR HIV, THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS OF WHETHER SIV INFECTION PROMOTES LRRK2 EXPRESSION, AND HOW LOSS OF LRRK2 IMPACTS SIV PATHOGENESIS AND THE HOST IMMUNE RESPONSE. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT LRRK2 CONTRIBUTES TO HIV PATHOGENESIS THROUGH REGULATION OF ANTIVIRAL IMMUNITY. TO TEST THIS, WE WILL USE A NON-HUMAN PRIMATE (NHP) MODEL TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF SIV INFECTION ON LRRK2 GENE EXPRESSION AND PROTEIN LEVELS LONGITUDINALLY IN CIRCULATING IMMUNE POPULATIONS AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, AND AT A SINGLE TIME POINT IN THE BRAIN AS LRRK2 IS DYNAMICALLY EXPRESSED IN THESE TISSUES. NEXT, WE WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF LRRK2 INHIBITION ON HOST RESPONSE TO SIV USING BOTH IN VIVO AND EX VIVO APPROACHES.

IN PARTICULAR, IT REMAINS TO BE ELUCIDATED HOW FIBROTIC REMODELING OF THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX (ECM), WHICH IS A HALLMARK FEATURE OF A PROTUMORIGENIC MICROENVIRONMENT, IMPACT BC RISK AND DRUG RESISTANCE. GIVEN THESE CONNECTIONS, THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL BE TO IDENTIFY MECHANISMS OF MATRIX-MEDIATED BC THERAPEUTIC RESISTANCE. AIM 1 WILL DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF FIBROTIC ECM ON BC DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE (DDR). AIM 2 WILL TEST HOW FIBROTIC ECM REGULATES THE DDR AND METABOLISM OF TUMOR CELLS AND THEIR RECIPROCAL INTERACTIONS.

EXHAUSTED HIV-SPECIFIC CD8 T CELLS, CHARACTERIZED BY ELEVATED EXPRESSION OF INHIBITORY RECEPTORS (E.G.

IN HIV AND OTHER CHRONIC VIRAL INFECTIONS, EXHAUSTED ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CD8 T CELLS EXPRESSING PD-1 CAN CREATE A SUPPRESSIVE ENVIRONMENT SUGGESTING THAT SUCH CELLS NOT ONLY HAVE A DIRECT ROLE IN DISEASE PROGRESSION BUT CAN CROSS-TALK WITH OTHER IMMUNE CELLS TO IMPAIR THEIR FUNCTION. CHRONIC HIV INFECTION DYSREGULATES T CELL ENERGY METABOLISM. HIV-SPECIFIC CD8 T CELLS ISOLATED FROM INFECTED INDIVIDUALS EXHIBIT ELEVATED MITOCHONDRIAL STRESS WHICH IS STILL APPARENT YEARS AFTER ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART).

INTERESTINGLY, BURGEONING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS NK CELLS MAY ALSO POSSESS PEPTIDE-SPECIFIC MEMORY RESPONSES (PREVIOUSLY ONLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY), ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF SEVERAL VIRAL INFECTIONS INCLUDING HIV/SIV AND CMV. HOW NK CELLS CAN FORM THESE ADAPTIVE RESPONSES IS THE SUBJECT OF AN EMERGING AREA IN IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES STUDYING TRAINED IMMUNITY OF TRADITIONALLY INNATE EFFECTORS LIKE NK CELLS. WHETHER ADAPTIVE NK CELL RESPONSES ARE THE RESULT OF EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS AS OBSERVED IN TRAINED IMMUNITY, OR THE PRODUCT OF PRE- FORMED POLYMORPHIC RECEPTORS LIKE KIRS OR MEMBERS OF THE NKG2 FAMILY WHICH INTERACT WITH MHC MOLECULES, OR YET TO BE DISCOVERED RECEPTORS IS TO BE DETERMINED.

HIV CO-INFECTION PREDISPOSES THE HOST TO REACTIVATION OF LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION (LTBI) RESULTING IN WORSENING OF DISEASE CONDITIONS AND MORTALITY. THE MOST WELL CHARACTERIZED IMPACT OF HIV IS THE CD4+ T CELL DEPLETION IN LYMPHOID TISSUES AND PERIPHERAL BLOOD. HOWEVER, STUDIES USING THE NONHUMAN PRIMATE (NHP) MODEL OF M. TUBERCULOSIS (MTB)/SIV CO-INFECTION HAVE REVEALED PROTECTIVE CD4+ T CELL-INDEPENDENT IMMUNE RESPONSES THAT SUPPRESS LTBI REACTIVATION. RECENT WORK SHOWS THAT THE MERE DEPLETION OF CD4+ T CELLS IS INSUFFICIENT TO CAUSE LTBI REACTIVATION IN SIV CO-INFECTED MACAQUES.

WILL ALLOW MAPPING OF THE MICROBIAL SIGNATURE AND EPITHELIAL INTEGRITY IN RESPONSE TO THE HOST-MICROBIOME INTERCELLULAR CROSSTALK BY UTILIZING SINGLE-CELL LEVEL MULTI-OMICS (ESPECIALLY GENOMICS AND TRANSCRIPTOMICS) AND RNA IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION. CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIP\u2019S MISSION STATEMENTS PROMOTING VETERINARY SCIENTISTS TO EMPLOY THEIR EXPERTISE IN COMPARATIVE MEDICINE TO INVESTIGATE HUMAN DISEASES, MY RESEARCH WILL ALLOW ME TO USE MY EXPERTISE IN COMPARATIVE GASTROENTEROLOGY AS WELL AS IN PRIMARY STEM CELL CULTURE TO INVESTIGATE ALTERATIONS IN INTESTINAL HOMEOSTASIS RELEVANT TO INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE. ALSO, AS ORIP SUPPORTS ANIMAL MODELING OF HUMAN DISEASES, I WILL BE USING THE DOG AS A SPONTANEOUS ANIMAL MODEL TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF GUT MICROBIOTA IN THE INTESTINAL EPITHELIUM GIVEN THEIR GENETIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SIMILARITY TO HUMANS. THE RESULTS GENERATED IN THIS PROPOSAL HAVE DIRECT IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN DISEASES, SINCE THEY WILL PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO GENETIC AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC ALTERATIONS INITIATING OR MAINTAINING THE CHRONIC INFLAMMATION IN THE GUT. SUCH FINDINGS CAN BE APPLIED TO VARIOUS CHRONIC CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EPIDEMIOLOGICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH MICROBIOME DYSBIOSIS AND DISTURBANCES OF INTESTINAL HEALTH (I.E., COLORECTAL CANCER, DIABETES MELLITUS, AND ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE, TO NAME A FEW). THIS KNOWLEDGE MAY BE APPLIED TO UNDERSTAND DISEASE DEVELOPMENT AND NOVEL THERAPIES AIMED AT MODIFYING INTESTINAL HOMEOSTASIS VIA PERTURBATION OF EPITHELIUM-MICROBIOME-IMMUNE AXIS IN THE INTESTINE.

AN ESTIMATED 300 MILLION OR NEARLY 4% OF THE HUMAN POPULATION SUFFERS FROM DEPRESSION GLOBALLY. DEPRESSION IS A COMPLEX MULTIFACTORIAL DISEASE AND RECENT EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT PREDISPOSES HUMANS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, INCLUDING DEPRESSION. ONE PROPOSED MECHANISM IS THAT ANTIBIOTIC ADMINISTRATION ALTERS GUT MICROBIOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AS WELL AS HINDERS GUT-BRAIN COMMUNICATION THROUGH DECREASED SYNTHESIS OF NEUROACTIVE COMPOUNDS. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH ANTIBIOTICS INDUCE DEPRESSION REMAIN UNCLEAR. IN THIS K01 AWARD PROPOSAL, I PROPOSE TO USE A NOVEL NONHUMAN PRIMATE MODEL, THE COMMON MARMOSET (CALLITHRIX JACCHUS), TO INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH ANTIBIOTICS INDUCE DEPRESSION. MARMOSETS SERVE AS A POWERFUL MODEL DUE TO THEIR HUMAN-LIKE SIMILARITY IN PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SEQUELAE. MY SPECIFIC AIMS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1. CHARACTERIZE CHANGES IN GUT MICROBIOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AS WELL AS BEHAVIOR IN MARMOSETS FOLLOWING ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT, 2. EVALUATE THE ADDITIVE EFFECT OF ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT AND SOCIAL SEPARATION ON INDUCTION OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY IN MARMOSETS, AND 3. EVALUATE THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECT OF FECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION ON TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION IN ANTIBIOTIC-INDUCED DYSBIOTIC MARMOSETS.

THE RESULTS FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL GENERATE NOVEL HYPOTHESES, SERVE AS CRITICAL PRELIMINARY DATA NECESSARY TO COMPETE FOR COMPETITIVE EXTRAMURAL FUNDING, AND REPRESENT THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS ESTABLISHING THE COMMON MARMOSET AS A TRANSLATIONAL MODEL FOR STUDYING EFFECTS OF ANTIBIOTIC USE ON MICROBIOME MODULATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEPRESSION. I HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED A TRAINING PLAN AND MENTORSHIP TEAM TO GAIN CRITICAL SKILLS IN NEUROBIOLOGY, METABOLOMICS AND MULTI-OMICS DATA ANALYSIS.

THE PARTICULAR INTEREST OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE HOW TUMOR CELLS DEVELOP TACTICS TO MANIPULATE IMMUNE CELLS TO FACILITATE CANCER PROGRESSION, AND HOW CHRONIC INFLAMMATION INDUCED IMMUNOSUPPRESSION ACCELERATES CARCINOGENESIS. DR. WETTERSTEN RECENTLY PUBLISHED THAT TUMOR CELL EXPRESSION OF A CELL ADHESION RECEPTOR, INTEGRIN AVSS3, IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENRICHMENT OF TUMOR-ASSOCIATED MACROPHAGES (TAMS), WHICH ARE KNOWN TO PROMOTE IMMUNE SUPPRESSION AND PREVENT THE INFLUX OF CYTOTOXIC T CELLS. HER NEW PRELIMINARY STUDIES REVEAL THAT AVSS3 EXPRESSION ON LUNG CANCER CELLS IS SUFFICIENT TO RECRUIT TAMS AND THAT INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS CAN INDUCE AVSS3 EXPRESSION BOTH ON NORMAL LUNG EPITHELIUM AS WELL AS LUNG CANCER CELLS. TOGETHER, THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST INFLAMMATION CAN INDUCE TUMOR CELL EXPRESSION OF AVSS3, WHICH IN TURN LEADS TO TAM ACCUMULATION, IMMUNE SUPPRESSION, AND TUMOR PROGRESSION. FURTHERMORE, INFLAMMATION INDUCED AVSS3 EXPRESSION ON LUNG EPITHELIUM MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELL-KNOWN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFLAMMATION AND CANCER.  THE OVERALL GOALS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO UNDERSTAND HOW AVSS3+ CANCER CELLS PROMOTE A PRO- TUMOR/IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MICROENVIRONMENT DURING CANCER PROGRESSION AND HOW AVSS3 EXPRESSION ON NORMAL LUNG EPITHELIUM INDUCES INFLAMMATION-MEDIATED CARCINOGENESIS. AIM 1 WILL DETERMINE IF TAM ENRICHMENT FACTORS FROM AVSS3+ CANCER CELLS PROMOTE AN IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MICROENVIRONMENT. THE GOAL OF AIM 2 IS TO TARGET INTEGRIN AVSS3+ CANCER CELLS TO SHIFT THE TUMOR IMMUNE PROFILE FROM PRO-TUMOR TO ANTI-TUMOR. AIM 3 WILL ASSESS IF INFLAMMATION-INDUCED EXPRESSION OF INTEGRIN AVSS3 ON LUNG EPITHELIAL CELLS ACCELERATES CARCINOGENESIS. TO ACHIEVE THESE AIMS, THE EXPRESSION OF AVSS3 WILL BE GENETICALLY MODIFIED IN IMMUNOCOMPETENT MOUSE MODELS OF LUNG CANCER AND INFLAMMATION TO REVEAL HOW AVSS3+ CELLS EXPLOIT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO ENABLE CANCER DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION. UNDERSTANDING THIS PROCESS WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN THE ANTI-TUMOR IMMUNE RESPONSE.  DR. WETTERSTEN\u2019S CAREER GOAL IS TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR IN AN ACADEMIC SETTING.

HOST RESTRICTION FACTORS EVOLVE TO PROTECT GENOMES FROM THREATS FROM VIRUSES AND TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS. THE CELLULAR ENDOSOMAL SORTING COMPLEXES REQUIRED FOR TRANSPORT (ESCRT) PATHWAY IS TARGETED BY MANY VIRUSES FOR BUDDING AND IS IMPLICATED IN RETROTRANSPOSITION, YET IS ESSENTIAL FOR HOST MEMBRANE REMODELING, INCLUDING DURING CYTOKINESIS. HOST EVOLUTION TO RESTRICT VIRUSES OR RETROTRANSPOSONS MUST THEREFORE PRESERVE KEY CELLULAR FUNCTIONS, WITH LITTLE ROOM FOR ERROR. RETROCHMP3 IS A RETROTRANSPOSED, TRUNCATED AND MUTATED COPY OF THE ESSENTIAL ESCRT GENE CHMP3 THAT DOMINANTLY INHIBITS VIRUS BUDDING AND LINE-1 RETROTRANSPOSITION IN CELLS. REMARKABLY, RETROCHMP3 HAS BEEN DETOXIFIED SO THAT IT DOES NOT BLOCK CYTOKINESIS. RETROCHMP3 AROSE AND EVOLVED INDEPENDENTLY IN MICE AND NEW WORLD MONKEYS, SUGGESTING THAT IT CONFERS SELECTIVE ADVANTAGES.

THE APPLICANT WILL EARN A PHD IN BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY EARNING A DVM. GIVEN THAT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND METABOLIC DISORDERS ARE AN INCREASINGLY PREVALENT GLOBAL EPIDEMIC AND THESE DISORDERS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO BOTH INCREASED MORTALITY AND INCREASED YEARS LIVED WITH DISABILITY, IT IS VITAL TO UNDERSTAND THE PATHOGENESIS OF THESE DISORDERS. EPIDEMIOLOGICALLY, CHRONIC STRESS HAS A PROMINENT ROLE IN CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK. NEURAL PROCESSES ARE KNOWN TO INFLUENCE PHYSIOLOGIC RESPONSES TO STRESS. HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE SEX-DEPENDENT CHANGES IN ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PHYSIOLOGY AFTER CHRONIC STRESS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THEREFORE, THE RESEARCH OUTLINED IN THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO DETERMINE HOW SPECIFIC NEURAL CIRCUITRY INFLUENCES STRESS REACTIVITY AND, CONSEQUENTLY, METABOLIC HEALTH IN MALE AND FEMALE RATS. SPECIFICALLY, TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SIGNALING FROM THE INFRALIMBIC CORTEX (IL) TO THE ROSTRAL VENTROLATERAL MEDULLA (RVLM) MITIGATES ENDOCRINE STRESS REACTIVITY AFTER CHRONIC STRESS IN A SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER. THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BE ADDRESSED: 1) DETERMINES IF ACTIVATION OF THE IL-RVLM CIRCUIT MITIGATES ENDOCRINE RESPONSES TO GLYCEMIC CHALLENGE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS IN MALE AND FEMALE RATS. 2) DETERMINES IF ACTIVATION OF THE IL-RVLM CIRCUIT FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO CHRONIC STRESS REDUCES FEMALE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ENDOCRINE HYPER- REACTIVITY. ACTIVATION OF THE IL-RVLM CIRCUIT WILL BE ACHIEVED USING OPTOGENETIC STIMULATION. ACUTE RESTRAINT WILL BE USED AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESSOR TO MEASURE ACTIVATION OF STRESS HORMONES, NAMELY GLUCOCORTICOIDS, GLUCOSE, GLUCAGON, ANGIOTENSIN II, AND INSULIN. GLYCEMIC CHALLENGE IN THE FORM OF A GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST WILL BE USED A METABOLIC STRESSOR. IN AIM 2, CHRONIC VARIABLE STRESS (CVS) EXPOSURE WILL CONSIST OF 14 DAYS OF TWICE- DAILY RANDOMIZED STRESSORS. FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO CVS, ANIMALS WILL UNDERGO ACUTE RESTRAINT AND GLYCEMIC CHALLENGE. IN ADDITION TO STRESS HORMONES, GLUCOSE, GLUCAGON, ANGIOTENSIN II AND INSULIN, NON-INVASIVE MEASURES OF METABOLISM AND AUTONOMIC ACTIVATION SUCH AS HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, AND BODY TEMPERATURE WILL BE TAKEN DURING ACUTE STRESS IN BOTH AIMS. CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING HORMONE MRNA WILL BE QUANTIFIED IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS. ADDITIONALLY, BASAL METABOLIC MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN IN THE FORM OF BODYWEIGHT AND FOOD INTAKE.

T CELL EXHAUSTION IS THE HIERARCHICAL LOSS OF PROLIFERATION, CYTOKINE PRODUCTION, AND EFFECTOR FUNCTION OF CD8+ T CELLS AFTER CHRONIC ANTIGEN STIMULATION. NOT EVERY T CELL BECOMES EXHAUSTED TO THE SAME DEGREE OR AT THE SAME RATE, BUT THE FACTORS GOVERNING HETEROGENEITY IN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO EXHAUSTION ARE UNDEFINED.

WE BELIEVE THAT DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGIN IS ALSO CONSEQUENTIAL IN CHRONIC INFECTION, FOR OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS THAT NEONATAL CD8+ T CELLS (DERIVED FROM THE FETAL LIVER) ARE RESISTANT TO PHENOTYPIC AND FUNCTIONAL EXHAUSTION, WHEREAS ADULT CELLS (DERIVED FROM ADULT BONE MARROW) ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE. WE ALSO SHOWED THAT OVEREXPRESSING LIN28B, AN ONCOFETAL RNA-BINDING PROTEIN THAT NEGATIVELY REGULATES LET-7 MICRORNAS AND IS ONLY EXPRESSED IN FETAL LIVER HSCS, IS SUFFICIENT TO CONVERT THE ADULT PHENOTYPE TO THE NEONATAL ONE. OUR OBJECTIVE IS THEREFORE TO DISSECT THE DEVELOPMENTALLY-REGULATED PROGRAMS UNDERLYING DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES TO CHRONIC STIMULATION. WE WILL USE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT ADULT CD8+ T CELLS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO EXHAUSTION THAN NEONATAL CELLS DUE TO AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN LET-7/LIN28B EXPRESSION THAT PROGRAM METABOLISM AWAY FROM AEROBIC GLYCOLYSIS.

MIRNAS ARE SHORT, NON-CODING RNA MOLECULES THAT RESPOND TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXTS AND MODULATE GENE EXPRESSION AT THE POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL LEVEL. AS SUCH, MIRNAS ARE CRITICAL REGULATORS OF A MYRIAD OF BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS, INCLUDING INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION.

CHALLENGES OF CAR-T CELL THERAPY INCLUDE TUMOR IMMUNE EVASION THROUGH LOSS OF TARGET ANTIGEN EXPRESSION BY TUMOR CELLS AND INHIBITION OF CAR-T CELL FUNCTION BY TUMOR EXPRESSED INHIBITORY MOLECULES. NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELLS PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE TO T CELLS THAT COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM BOTH ANTIGEN DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT KILLING.
