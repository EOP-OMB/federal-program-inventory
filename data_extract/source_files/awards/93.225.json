PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS (VTE) REMAIN A LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN POSTOPERATIVE PATIENTS. NATIONAL GUIDELINES RECOMMEND INITIATION OF PROPHYLAXIS BASED ON INDIVIDUALIZED RISK STRATIFICATION. DESPITE THIS STANDARD, MULTIPLE STUDIES, INCLUDING AN EMORY UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL STUDY CONDUCTED BY OUR GROUP, HAVE SHOWN THAT MOST HIGH-RISK PATIENTS DO NOT RECEIVE RECOMMENDED PROPHYLAXIS. STANDARDIZED USE OF VTE RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS (RAMS) IN SURGICAL PATIENTS HAS BEEN LIMITED TO DATE DUE TO A MYRIAD OF FACTORS INCLUDING CONFUSION AROUND THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS, A PERCEIVED INCREASED RISK OF BLEEDING FROM ADMINISTRATION OF PROPHYLACTIC ANTICOAGULANT MEDICATIONS, AND THE CUMBERSOME ADDITIONAL WORKFLOW FOR RAM CALCULATION. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE STUDY FOUND THAT THE DETAILED HISTORY AND THE CAPTURE OF NON-ROUTINE LAB TESTS AS REQUIRED BY THE CAPRINI SCORE ADDS 6 MINUTES PER PATIENT TO A PHYSICIAN\u2019S CLINIC WORKFLOW. THE POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION OF THIS PROCESS IS AN EXCITING STEP TOWARD PATIENT CARE THAT IS BOTH MORE STANDARDIZED AND MORE PATIENT-CENTERED, BUT IT REQUIRES DEVELOPMENT OF MODELS BUILT ON DATA THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE IN THE PRE- OPERATIVE PHASE OF CARE SUCH THAT A CARE PLAN CAN BE ENACTED PROSPECTIVELY. OUR GROUP\u2019S PREVIOUS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATED THAT READILY AVAILABLE DATA SUCH AS A PATIENT\u2019S AGE, BMI, RACE, AND COMORBIDITY BURDEN \u2013 IN LIEU OF A MORE COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING RAM \u2013 COULD BE UTILIZED TO EFFECTIVELY RISK-STRATIFY PATIENTS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF A STANDARDIZED, BRIEF, AND AUTOMATED VTE RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL IN THE PRE-OPERATIVE WORKFLOW WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SURGICAL CARE BY INCREASING DELIVERY OF INDICATED PROPHYLAXIS, THEREBY DECREASING VTE RATES AND IMPROVING PERIOPERATIVE EFFICIENCY. WITH THAT LONG-TERM GOAL, OUR PROPOSED SPECIFIC AIMS INCLUDE (1) THE APPLICATION OF MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND DECISION TREE MACHINE LEARNING TO THE NATIONAL SURGICAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT DATABASE TO DEVELOP A NOVEL PRE-OPERATIVE VTE RAM AND (2) A SCOPING REVIEW OF VTE PROPHYLAXIS GUIDELINES WITH THE SUBSEQUENT PROPOSAL OF A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL THAT WOULD FACILITATE ACTIONABLE RISK STRATIFICATION. FUTURE RESEARCH WILL AIM TO BUILD THE RAM INTO THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD AND SUBSEQUENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED PROTOCOL, INCLUDING AUTOMATION OF THE DEVELOPED MODEL AND TRACKING OF IMPACT ON PERTINENT PROCESS MEASURES AND VTE OUTCOMES. PROSPECTIVE PATIENT-LEVEL RISK ASSESSMENT DRIVING PRE-OPERATIVE WORKFLOWS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE SURGICAL CARE MORE STANDARDIZED, MORE PATIENT-CENTERED, AND MORE EQUITABLE.

IN THE CONTEXT OF WIDENING DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH BY SOCIAL CLASS ALONGSIDE RISING INCOME EQUALITY, THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO EXAMINE HOW CHANGES IN A POLICY INTENDED TO CHANGE THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME \u2013 THE MINIMUM WAGE \u2013 AFFECTS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, FOOD INSECURITY, AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG PEOPLE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION. WHILE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE REMAINED UNCHANGED SINCE 2009, THIRTY STATES HAVE INCREASED THEIR MINIMUM WAGE SINCE THEN. THERE IS A ROBUST ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LITERATURE LOOKING AT HOW THE MINIMUM WAGE AFFECTS EARNINGS AND EMPLOYMENT; THESE STUDIES GENERALLY SHOW NULL TO VERY MODEST EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT AND POSITIVE EFFECTS ON EARNINGS, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN THE RACIAL EARNINGS GAP. YET THE IMPACT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE ON ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN AS MUCH DETAIL. THIS PROPOSAL WILL EXAMINE THREE SPECIFIC OUTCOMES THAT COULD BE AFFECTED MOST DIRECTLY BY INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM WAGE: BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE, FOOD INSECURITY, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. HEALTH CARE COULD MITIGATE SOME OF THE DOWNSTREAM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF LOW INCOME, BUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ITSELF VARIES BY INCOME: IN 2017, 29% OF NON-ELDERLY ADULTS IN THE LOWEST INCOME GROUP WERE UNABLE TO SEE A PHYSICIAN BECAUSE OF COST, VERSUS 9% IN THE HIGHEST INCOME GROUP. EVEN FOR THOSE ABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE, THE ABILITY TO FOLLOW A TREATMENT PLAN AND MANAGE CHRONIC ILLNESS CAN BE HINDERED BY FOOD INSECURITY AND POOR MENTAL HEALTH, WHICH ARE ALSO CONCENTRATED AMONG LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL USE NATIONAL HEALTH SURVEY DATA AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL METHODS TO ACCOMPLISH TWO KEY AIMS. FIRST, I WILL ASSESS THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGE LAWS ON ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, FOOD INSECURITY, AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG ADULTS MOST LIKELY TO WORK IN LOW-WAGE OCCUPATIONS. SECOND, I WILL EXAMINE THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF MINIMUM WAGE LAWS ON HEALTH AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BY RACE, ETHNICITY, CHRONIC DISEASE STATUS, AND GEOGRAPHY.

THE TREATMENT OF PERIOPERATIVE ANXIETY HAS TRADITIONALLY REVOLVED AROUND THE ADMINISTRATION OF ANXIOLYTICS AND ANALGESICS, MOST COMMONLY IN THE FORM OF SHORT-ACTING OPIOIDS AND BENZODIAZEPINES. HOWEVER, THESE MEDICATIONS NOT ONLY HAVE SHORT TERM SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND POSSIBLE APNEA BUT CAN ALSO IN SOME CASES RESULT IN ADDICTION AND LONG-TERM DEPENDENCE.  WE PROPOSE A NOVEL INTERVENTION: A PERIOPERATIVE, SURGERY-SPECIFIC GUIDED MEDITATION PROGRAM TO DECREASE PATIENT ANXIETY. WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH A MEDITATION PROGRAM IS AN OPTIMAL MEANS OF DECREASING ANXIETY IN VASCULAR SURGERY PATIENTS AS IT IS A NON-PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTION THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN DECREASING PERIOPERATIVE PAIN AND ANXIETY FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING GENERAL ANESTHESIA IN THE SPECIALTIES OF CARDIAC AND SPINE SURGERY. ADDITIONALLY, GUIDED MEDITATION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS THE BODY-SCAN TECHNIQUE AND BREATH-FOCUSED MEDITATION ARE SYNERGISTIC WITH WHAT PATIENTS ARE REQUESTED TO DO INTRAOPERATIVELY, NAMELY KEEPING THEIR LEGS IMMOBILE AND INTERMITTENTLY HOLDING THEIR BREATH.

THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SEEKING GENDER-AFFIRMING PROCEDURES HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS, WITH OVER 8,000 GENDER-AFFIRMING PROCEDURES PERFORMED IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2017 ALONE. DESPITE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, GENDER-AFFIRMING PROCEDURES ARE COSTLY, AND OFTEN PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FOR MOST PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE.

THEREFORE, AS WITH THE INITIAL ICD IMPLANTATION, ICD GENERATOR EXCHANGES ARE PREFERENCE SENSITIVE, BUT STUDIES SHOW THAT PATIENTS ARE NOT AWARE OF THE CHOICE TO NOT UNDERGO AN ICD GENERATOR EXCHANGE. GIVEN GENERATOR EXCHANGES ARE CURRENTLY PERFORMED WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THESE IMPORTANT FACTORS, SHARED DECISION-MAKING MAY PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THE DECISION IS CONSISTENT WITH PATIENTS\u2019 EXPECTATIONS AND VALUES. TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE SHARED DECISION-MAKING CAN IMPROVE DECISIONS FOR ICD GENERATOR EXCHANGES, THIS PROPOSAL WILL DELIVER A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF PATIENTS\u2019 EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS REGARDING GENERATOR EXCHANGE DECISIONS. IN ADDITION, CLINICAL TOOLS TO PREDICT THE INDIVIDUALIZED RISK OF NEEDING CONTINUED ICD THERAPY AT THE TIME OF A GENERATOR EXCHANGE ARE BEING DEVELOPED. THIS INFORMATION IS HELPFUL TO CLINICIANS, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER PRESENTING PATIENTS WITH INDIVIDUALIZED RISK WOULD IMPACT THEIR GENERATOR EXCHANGE DECISIONS. GIVEN PATIENTS ALREADY HAVE ALREADY BEEN LIVING WITH AN IMPLANTED ICD AT THE TIME OF BATTERY DEPLETION, THEY MAY HAVE STRONG PREFERENCES REGARDING THE GE AND ADDITIONAL DATA MAY NOT IMPACT THEIR DECISION. TO DETERMINE IF PROVIDING PATIENTS\u2019 INDIVIDUALIZED RISK ASSESSMENTS IMPACT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO UNDERGO AN ICD GENERATOR EXCHANGE, WE WILL CONDUCT A SERIES OF ITERATIVE DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENTS. THIS PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH AHRQ GOALS AND WILL PRODUCE HIGH-IMPACT DATA TO DRIVE INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT FOR A PREVALENT BUT LARGELY IGNORED DECISION WITH SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE IMPLICATIONS AND IMPACT ON PATIENTS\u2019 LIVES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4d4ce585-e95e-2593-758c-86dc120820ad-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32HS028558_7528"}, {"internal_id": 140657906, "Award ID": "F32HS028555", "Award Amount": 153436.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-17", "CFDA Number": "93.225", "Description": "IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT NUTRITION BENEFIT PROGRAM PARTICIPATION ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  FOOD INSECURITY (FI) AFFECTS ALMOST 18 MILLION CHILDREN ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, PLACING THEM AT INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING POOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS, AND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY. CHILDREN EXPERIENCING FI ARE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO ACCESS PREVENTIVE CARE AND EXPERIENCE INCREASED RATES OF DELAYED MEDICAL CARE DUE TO COST AND INCREASED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) UTILIZATION. FI DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS BLACK AND HISPANIC CHILDREN AND CHILDREN FROM IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND CAN THEREFORE EXACERBATE EXISTING DISPARITIES IN THESE CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION. CHILDHOOD FI THEREFORE REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS, PAYERS, AND POLICYMAKERS SEEKING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE, IMPROVE OUTCOMES, AND REDUCE AVOIDABLE HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AND COSTS. GOVERNMENT NUTRITION BENEFIT PROGRAMS, SUCH AS WIC AND SNAP, ARE KEY SOURCES OF NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES WITH FI. PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS HAS PROVEN HEALTH BENEFITS, INCLUDING DECREASED RATES OF PRETERM BIRTH AND LOW BIRTHWEIGHT AMONG INFANTS, AND IMPROVED DIET QUALITY AND REDUCED FI AMONG CHILDREN. HOWEVER, ONLY 50% OF ELIGIBLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN CURRENTLY RECEIVE WIC, AND ONLY 75-85% OF ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVE SNAP. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS COULD THEREFORE MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CHILDHOOD FI BY IDENTIFYING FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR, BUT NOT ENROLLED IN, WIC OR SNAP AND PROVIDING THEM WITH ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE. ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE INTERVENTIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BOTH ENHANCE HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE INTEGRATION AND GENERATE CROSS-SECTOR COST SAVINGS FOR PAYERS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS. IN ORDER TO INFORM THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NOVEL, EFFECTIVE ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE INTERVENTIONS, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO (1) CHARACTERIZE THE IMPACT OF WIC AND SNAP PARTICIPATION ON CHILDREN'S OVERALL HEALTH AND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, (2) CHARACTERIZE HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION PATTERNS AND HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR, BUT NOT RECEIVING, WIC AND SNAP BENEFITS, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHERE ENROLLMENT INTERVENTIONS SHOULD FOCUS AND ESTIMATE POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING ENROLLMENT, AND (3) DEVELOP FAMILY- CENTERED STRATEGIES FOR PROVIDING WIC AND SNAP ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE IN HEALTHCARE SETTINGS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS APPLICATION ARE: (1A) TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN WIC AND SNAP PARTICIPATION AND CAREGIVER- REPORTED CHILD HEALTH AND ACCESS TO CARE, (1B) TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN WIC AND SNAP PARTICIPATION AND HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AND EXPENDITURES, AND (2) TO EXPLORE FOOD INSECURE FAMILIES' PERCEIVED DETERMINANTS OF GOVERNMENT BENEFITS ENROLLMENT AND THEIR REVEALED PREFERENCES FOR HEALTH-SYSTEM BASED BENEFITS ENROLLMENT SUPPORT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b655b3eb-6e27-dfdd-c16c-ad7f8949f987-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32HS028555_7528"}, {"internal_id": 98142945, "Award ID": "F32HS027724", "Award Amount": 136839.91, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-06-16", "CFDA Number": "93.225", "Description": "AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING THE DRIVERS OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE END-OF-LIFE CARE DELIVERY IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "89c1b286-4842-cf79-9563-7ec2e987f771-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32HS027724_7528"}, {"internal_id": 100874817, "Award ID": "F32HS027286", "Award Amount": 127623.57, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-07-09", "CFDA Number": "93.225", "Description": "IMPROVING RURAL CANCER CARE DELIVERY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "HI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7997b0e4-1373-a617-5e8b-0e0e80c459d7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32HS027286_7528"}, {"internal_id": 100874815, "Award ID": "F32HS027285", "Award Amount": 153904.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-07-08", "CFDA Number": "93.225", "Description": "DISPARITIES IN DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM DISEASE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2a11a6dc-948e-2337-13cf-40ff24b2768a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32HS027285_7528"}, {"internal_id": 97470605, "Award ID": "F32HS027075", "Award Amount": 21165.01, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-05-15", "CFDA Number": "93.225", "Description": "VALIDATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT FOR MANAGING CHILDREN WITH MILD HEAD INJURIES AND INTRACRANIAL INJURY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e0af38c9-92a8-f2cb-a5b8-4b4f14f99689-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32HS027075_7528"}, {"internal_id": 82469172, "Award ID": "F32HS027071", "Award Amount": 131164.86, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-07-01", "CFDA Number": "93.225", "Description": "ENGAGEMENT IN WEIGHT MANAGEMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS FROM LOW-SES BACKGROUNDS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "RI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8c42360e-cd0f-f49d-f961-6ea333c13ac6-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32HS027071_7528"}, {"internal_id": 48621620, "Award ID": "F32HS025079", "Award Amount": 202510.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2016-09-01", "CFDA Number": "93.226", "Description": "VARIATION IN SURGEON-LEVEL INTRAOPERATIVE COSTS: AN INTERVENTION STUDY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3231cda5-201a-6da0-de9e-e9810a848983-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32HS025079_7528"}]
