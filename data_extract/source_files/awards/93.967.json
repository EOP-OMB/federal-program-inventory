ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND LABORATORY SERVICES ARE MANAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES (DBHDS) AND THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES - DIVISION OF CONSOLIDATED LABORATORY SERVICES (DCLS), RESPECTIVELY.  THE EXISTING WORKFORCE IS THE FIRST AREA OF FOCUS FOR VDH AND ITS SISTER AGENCIES. THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITY WILL ALLOW PUBLIC HEALTH TO MAINTAIN STAFF IN AREAS OF DEMONSTRATED NEED; INCREASE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES; ENSURE VIRGINIA MAINTAINS A CULTURE OF INCLUSION AND BELONGING; AND INITIATE RETENTION BONUSES TO ENSURE RETENTION OF VALUED EMPLOYEES.

THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE TIMELY INFORMATION INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, HAS PROVEN CRITICAL DURING RECENT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND ENGAGEMENT WILL ALSO SERVE OUR SOCIALLY MARGINALIZED AND DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS MORE EQUITABLY.  DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS OUTSIDE THE AGENCY WILL LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT OF SUCH FOUNDATIONAL CAPABILITIES, REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES AND FURTHER CLOSE HEALTH EQUITY GAPS ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH.  VDH WILL CONTINUE ITS FOCUS ON CREATING A MORE MODERN AND EFFICIENT DATA INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCREASING DATA INTEROPERABILITY THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF A DATA MODERNIZATION PLAN THAT INCREASES THE USABILITY OF AGENCY DATA.

AS RESULT, THE TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (TDH), LIKE OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES, HAVE DEVELOPED THE NEED FOR INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMMING AIMED AT IMPROVING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE, REBUILDING THEIR WORKFORCE, AND EXPANDING THEIR DIGITAL CAPABILITIES THROUGH DATA MODERNIZATION METHODS. TO ADDRESS TDH\u2019S NEEDS, THE AGENCY AND ITS LEADERSHIP HAVE DEVELOPED A PLETHORA OF TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES, INITIATIVES, AND PROGRAMMING THAT HAVE A FOCUS ON EQUITY, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND DATA EXPANSION.

TDH INTENDS TO PERFORM THE DESCRIBED ACTIVITIES THROUGH COLLABORATING WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, TENNESSEE SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, LOCAL NONPROFITS, AND PROFESSIONAL CERTIFYING BODIES. IT IS THE GOAL OF TDH TO IMPROVE STATE EFFORTS IN ADVANCING THE HEALTH OF ALL TENNESSEANS AND TDH BELIEVES THAT THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS IS TO START WITH STRENGTHENING ITS CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE, WORKFORCE, AND DATA SYSTEMS.
