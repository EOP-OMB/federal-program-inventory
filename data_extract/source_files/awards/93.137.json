LANGUAGE CONCORDANCE IS THE GOLD STANDARD IN HEALTHCARE AND OCCURS WHEN PATIENTS CAN DIRECTLY CONVERSE WITH THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OR WITH CERTIFIED MEDICAL INTERPRETERS IN THEIR PREFERRED LANGUAGE. IN THIS GRANT, WE SEEK TO REMOVE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH LEP WHO ACCESS EMERGENCY AND PRIMARY CARE SERVICES AT AN INNER-CITY SAFETY NET HOSPITAL BY USING A MULTI-FACTORIAL IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCES APPROACH TO ADDRESS THREE CONSTITUENCIES: PEOPLE WITH LEP, THE CLINICAL WORKFORCE WHO CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH LEP, AND HOSPITAL-BASED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH LEP.   FOR PEOPLE WITH LEP, OUR APPROACH IS AWARENESS OF LANGUAGE ACCESS RIGHTS AND ACCESS TO INTERPRETER TRAINING. WE WILL WORK WITH EIGHT MULTI-ETHNIC COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR CLIENTS TO DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY RESPONSIVE LANGUAGE ACCESS RIGHTS AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS.

FO R THE CLINICAL WORKFORCE WHO CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH LEP, OUR APPROACH IS EDUCATION/AWARENESS, ENVIRONMENTAL CUES, AND CHANGES IN INFORMATICS SYSTEMS (EHR). WE WILL CREATE A BEST PRACTICES EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM IN FOUR AREAS: LANGUAGE ACCESS RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WITH LEP INCLUDING CHANGES IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) DOCUMENTATION, FLUENCY EXAM/CERTIFIED INTERPRETER PROGRAMS, HEALTH LITERATE SKILLS (I.E., TEACH-BACK) WHEN WORKING WITH INTERPRETERS, AND NOT USING AD-HOC INTERPRETERS WHEN TREATING PATIENTS WITH LEP.   A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF THIS PROGRAM IS BEHAVIOR CHANGE THROUGH MODIFICATION OF EHR DOCUMENTATION ALONG WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CUES FOR THE CLINICAL WORKFORCE.

THERE ARE RACIAL AND NEIGHBORHOOD DISPARITIES IN LIFE-SAVING NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION. IN 2019, GREATER THAN 75% OF FATAL OPIOID-INVOLVED OVERDOSES IN 37 STATES HAD NO EVIDENCE OF NALOXONE ADMINISTRATION AND STRUCTURAL RACISM IS PRESERVED IN OPIOID OVERDOSE EDUCATION AND RESPONSE. DISCRETIONARY NATURE OF DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT COUPLED WITH FEARS OF LEGAL CONSEQUENCES AMONG MANY BLACK OPIOID USERS, MISINFORMATION ABOUT OVERDOSE AND NALOXONE, AND STIGMATIZING BELIEFS ARE MAJOR FACTORS THAT PERPETUATE RACIAL DISPARITIES, CONTRIBUTING TO A DISPARATE BURDEN OF OVERDOSES AMONG BLACKS.

THIS PROJECT WILL BE A COMMUNITY PROCESS TO IDENTIFY POLICIES, IMPLEMENT POLICY CHANGES IN UP TO THREE SETTINGS, AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THOSE POLICY CHANGES. OUR MISSION IS TO SUPPORT EQUITY IN THE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MN CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND TOXIC STRESS NEGATIVELY IMPACT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. POLICIES AND SYSTEMS BUILT ON SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION, WITHOUT THE VOICE OR CONSIDERATION OF THE IMPACT ON BLACK COMMUNITIES ARE THE ROOTS OF INEQUITIES IN HEALTH, INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE IMPACT OF INCREASED COMMUNITY CAPACITY AND POLICY CHANGES DIRECTLY TO POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE ALLIANCE FOR YOUTH IS A JOINT POWERS ORGANIZATION BETWEEN THE CITIES OF BROOKLYN PARK AND BROOKLYN CENTER: COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION, PARKS AND RECREATION, POLICE; ANOKA-HENNEPIN SCHOOLS, BROOKLYN CENTER COMMUNITY SCHOOLS, HENNEPIN COUNTY, HENNEPIN TECHNICAL COLLEGE, NORTH HENNEPIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE, OSSEO AREA SCHOOLS, AND ROBBINSDALE AREA SCHOOLS. GIVEN THEIR STRATEGIC POSITION, YOUTH-CENTERED PRACTICES AND IMPLEMENTATION TRACK RECORD, WE BELIEVE THE BBAY WILL BE AN EXCEPTIONAL PARTNER WITH MDH TO IMPLEMENT POLICY CHANGE TO IMPROVE BLACK YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH IN BROOKLYN CENTER AND BROOKLYN PARK, MN. THE REIMAGINE BLACK YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVE WILL CHANGE SYSTEMS AND BLACK YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES BY IMPLEMENTING A YOUTH-CENTERED AND COMMUNITY-DRIVEN PROCESS TO IDENTIFY, ANALYZE, IMPLEMENT, AND EVALUATE SPECIFIC POLICY CHANGES IN A RANGE OF SETTINGS. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, BLACK YOUTH WILL HAVE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD OR ENHANCE SELF-AGENCY, CRITICAL MINDEDNESS, AND CONNECTEDNESS, THROUGH THEIR ROLE AS COUNCIL MEMBERS, EVALUATORS, SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECT PARTICIPANTS. THEIR ENGAGEMENT, COUPLED WITH A COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES A STATE RESOURCE TEAM AND LOCAL ADVISORY COUNCIL, WILL LEVERAGE RESOURCES ACROSS STATE AND LOCAL SECTORS AND ACCELERATE EFFECTIVE POLICY IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, DEMONSTRATION, EVALUATION AND DISSEMINATION. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO HELP MDH FURTHER REFINE AND AMPLIFY A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO MENTAL HEALTH IN MINNESOTA FOR BLACK YOUTH. IT WILL PROVIDE SPECIFIC POLICIES THAT IMPACT MENTAL WELL-BEING, FURTHER DEFINE AND AMPLIFY THE LINK BETWEEN EQUITY AND MENTAL HEALTH, AND HIGHLIGHT A COMMUNITY PRIORITIZATION PROCESS. THIS SUPPORTS THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY HEALTH DIVISION AND OUR TITLE V GOALS, AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS TO ADDRESS MENTAL WELL-BEING IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT/COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. IT WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATEWIDE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND SUICIDE PREVENTION WORK TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING THROUGH LOCAL POLICY AND SYSTEMS CHANGE. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK CLOSELY WITH A COMMUNITY TO CO-CREATE A COMMUNITY DIALOGUE AND PRIORITIZATION PROCESS FOCUSED ON MENTAL WELL-BEING. IT PROVIDES A WAY TO CLOSELY EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF POLICY CHANGES AND A COMMUNITY PROCESS ON MENTAL WELL-BEING.

THE MITIGATION OF TRAUMA RELATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS EXPERIENCED BY BLACK YOUTH THROUGH POLICY REFORM IS STRUCTURED ACCORDING TO THE BLACK YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH POLICY FRAMEWORK PHASES. FOR THIS INITIATIVE, \u201cBLACK YOUTH\u201d IS DEFINED AS \u201cCHILDREN AGES 10-17 YEARS OLD, WHO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN, OR FROM THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN, AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WITH AFRICAN ANCESTRY WHO ARE LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES.\u201d BLACK AND AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST HEALTH DISPARITIES THROUGHOUT THE GEOGRAPHIC CATCHMENT AREA AT DISPROPORTIONATE RATES, AS IDENTIFIED BY THE PREVENTION INSTITUTE\u2019S 2021 COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EQUITY STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN.  THE DISPARITIES OF FOCUS ARE FOOD INEQUITY, INCOME INEQUALITY, HOUSING INSECURITY, VIOLENCE, SUBSTANCE MISUSE, AND TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES. THESE SIX HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES (ACES).  CHILDHOOD MENTAL ILLNESS IS A CHRONIC CONDITION THAT CAN CONTINUE THROUGH THE LIFESPAN AND IMPACT OVERALL HEALTH. CHILDREN WHO SUFFER FROM ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND MOOD DISORDERS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY FUNCTIONING AT HOME AND IN SCHOOL, OR FORMING POSITIVE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS. TRAUMA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN CHILDREN AND CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE TRAUMATIC EVENTS OR ACES, ARE AT A HIGHER RISK OF DEVELOPING PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND HAVE A HIGHER RATES OF DISEASE AND DISABILITY. REPORTED IN THE 2019 MONTGOMERY COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT, 22% OF BLACK YOUT H GRADES 7 THROUGH 12 REPORTED HAVING 3 OR MORE ACES. CULTURALLY SPECIFIC ACES, SUCH AS RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, ARE PARTICULARLY HARMFUL TO THE MENTAL HEALTH OF BLACK YOUTH, AS FOUND THROUGH EMERGING EVIDENCE. CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THREE OR MORE ACES ARE 4.5 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ADHD, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OR CONDUCT/BEHAVIOR DISORDER THAN CHILDREN WITH 0 ACES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF ADDRESSING ACES IS PREVENTING THE ROOT CAUSES OF CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY.  THE NEED TO ADDRESS ACES IN OHIO IS URGENT. EARLY DETECTION AND INTERVENTION AMONG CHILDREN IS AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF ACES ON A CHILD'S OVERALL HEALTH. WHILE APPROACHES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO SCREEN SELECTED POPULATIONS OF CHILDREN MOST AT-RISK FOR CHILDHOOD TRAUMA, SUCH AS THOSE INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM, MANY CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA WITH NO INVOLVEMENT IN EITHER SYSTEM. ADDRESSING ACES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE MENTAL WELL-BEING OF BLACK YOUTH WILL REQUIRE A MULTITIERED APPROACH ENCOMPASSING PRIMARY, SECONDARY, AND TERTIARY PREVENTION MEASURES. THIS PROJECT WILL SERVE MONTGOMERY COUNTY THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACES AWARE POLICY IN THREE IDENTIFIED SETTINGS THROUGH CROSS-SECTOR COLLABORATION THROUGH THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA ADVISORY COUNCIL.

THE COVID-19 POSITIVITY RATE IS 18.6% IN WAYNE COUNTY (WC), THE STATE?S MOST POPULOUS COUNTY. IN WC, 27% OF PEOPLE HAVE RECEIVED ONE VACCINATION DOSE; THIS RATE IS 5% AMONG BLACK PERSONS. THE PANDEMIC HAS REVEALED DISPARITIES IN RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS, WHICH COMPRISE 50% OF THE PROJECT?S TOTAL TARGET POPULATION OF 160,567 PEOPLE ACROSS NINE CITIES. BLACK RESIDENTS MAKE UP 14% OF MICHIGAN?S POPULATION BUT 43% OF COVID-19 DEATHS, A RATE FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN OF WHITE POPULATIONS. AMONG HISPANICS, RATES OF INFECTION ARE TWICE AS HIGH AS FOR WHITE RESIDENTS. ARAB AND OTHER IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS COMPRISE 15.3% OF WAYNE COUNTY?S POPULATION. ARABS COMPRISE 1.5% OF MICHIGAN?S POPULATION AND 3% OF CORONAVIRUS DEATHS. BECAUSE THE U.S. CENSUS CLASSIFIES MIDDLE EASTERN AND OTHER ETHNICITIES AS ?WHITE?, INFECTION RATES ARE UNREPORTED AMONG THESE COMMUNITIES. COVID-19 INFECTION RATES ARE FIVE TIMES HIGHER AMONG THE MAJORITY BLACK POPULATION (72%) OF WAYNE COUNTY?S JAIL POPULATION THAN IN OTHER GROUPS.

INCARCERATION ALSO PREVENTS SOCIAL DISTANCING. IN THE FOCUS AREA, 20% OF RESIDENTS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. BLACK, HISPANIC AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES OFTEN DISTRUST GOVERNMENT AND MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS DUE TO A HISTORY OF HEALTHCARE MA LPRACTICE, NOT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY DOCTORS, AND FEAR OF SHARING PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE MISUSED.

WEST FRESNO FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER (WFFRC) AND CENTRO LA FAMILIA ADVOCACY SERVICES (CLFA) WILL ACT AS LEAD ORGANIZATIONS, PROVIDING SUPPORT AND OVERSITE TO THE PROJECT. WFFRC IS WELL-KNOWN AND TRUSTED IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND CLFA IS WELL-KNOWN AND TRUSTED IN THE LATINX COMMUNITY. BOTH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EXISTING COLLABORATIONS AND HAVE PROVIDED CULTURALLY BASED COMMUNITY  SERVICES OVER THE LAST DECADE. OTHER PARTNERS INCLUDE JAKARA MOVEMENT, FRESNO INTERDENOMINATIONAL REFUGEE MINISTRIES, AND READING AND BEYOND. EACH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN EMBEDDED IN VARIOUS MINORITY COMMUNITIES RANGING FROM PUNJABI SIKH COMMUNITIES, HMONG COMMUNITIES, TO LATINX AND ARABIC COMMUNITIES. THE CITY OF FRESNO WILL ENHANCE THE EXISTING IMPACT OF THE CBOS BY EXPA NDING THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WHO ARE PROVIDING LINKAGES AND SUPPORT TO FAMILIES IN THE URBAN REGIONS OF FRESNO. ACCORDING TO DATA COLLECTED BY THE FRESNO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SPECIFIC ZIP CODES HAVE LAGGED BEHIND OTHERS IN PARTICIPATING IN VACCINATION FOR COVID-19. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ARE TRUSTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND THEY WILL UTILIZE EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULUM TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WHILE INCREASING OVERALL HEALTH LITERACY REGARDING EXISTING HEALTH CONCERNS ALONG WITH A FOCUS ON COIVD-19 FACTS TO INCREASE UTILIZATION OF VACCINES, CONTACT TRACING, AND TESTING.

(NWA) METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA (MSA) OF BENTON AND WASHINGTON COUNTY AS DEFINED BY THE CENSUS BUREAU?S URBANIZED AREAS CLASSIFICATION. THE TARGET POPULATION IS LATINX AND MARSHALLESE PACIFIC ISLANDERS WITHIN THE MSA BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE TOP 4TH ACCORDING TO THE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX (SVI). SPECIFICALLY, LATINX AND MARSHALLESE HAVE VERY DENSE AND UNSTABLE HOUSING WITH MORE PEOPLE THAN ROOMS, SPEAK ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE WITH LOW ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, HAVE LOW HEALTH LITERACY, AND ARE NOT BEING REACHED THROUGH EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES. THE COVID-19 RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE NWA MSA WERE SO STARK THAT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) CAME TO NWA TO INVESTIGATE. THE CDC?S REPORT DOCUMENTED THAT 45% OF ALL ADULT COVID-19 CASES IN NWA WERE LATINX, AND 19% WERE MARSHALLESE. LATINX AND MARSHALLESE ONLY ACCOUNT FOR 17% AND 1.6% OF THE REGION?S POPULATION, RESPECTIVELY. COVID-19 DEATHS IN NWA WERE ALSO DISPARATE ACROSS RACE AND ETHNICITY. MARSHALLESE DEATHS PER 100,000 IN NWA WERE ESTIMATED TO BE 372.4 ? MUCH HIGHER THAN THE OVERALL DEATH RATIO OF 5.10 PER 100,000 AND THE DEATH RATIO FOR CAUCASIANS OF 4.03 PER 100,000.  THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF REACH IS TO LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING NETWORK OF STRONG COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO IMPROVE HEALTH LITERACY AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG LATINX AND MARSHALLESE COMMUNITIES, POPULATIONS AT HIGHEST RISK FOR HEALTH DISPARITIES. BENTON COUNTY (LEAD APPLICANT) WILL WORK WITH WASHINGTON COUNTY, THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS FOR HEALTH SCIENCES (UAMS), THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT PINE BLUFF (UAPB, MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTION) AND THE NORTHWEST ARKANSAS COUNCIL (NWAC) TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: (1) ENGAGE REACH PARTNERS; (2) DEVELOP AND UTILIZE A DISPARITIES IMPACT STATEMENT; (3) DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A COVID-19 HEALTH LITERACY PLAN; (4) IMPLEMENT A CULT URALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE HEALTH INFORMATION AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGN THAT INCREASES APPROPRIATE HEALTH LITERACY PRACTICES AND INTERVENTION RESOURCES FOR THE MARSHALLESE AND LATINX COMMUNITIES.THE DISPARITIES IMPACT STATEMENT WILL SERVE AS THE FRAMEWORK FOR TARGETED IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, EVALUATION, IMPACT, AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE REACH PROGRAM. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN EVALUATION PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH UAPB (MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTION) AND UAMS. ALL OUTCOME MEASURES ARE LINKED TO THE DISPARITIES IMPACT STATEMENT. WE WILL REVIEW PROGRESS ON PROCESS MEASURES MONTHLY AND REVIEW PROGRESS ON OUTCOME MEASURES QUARTERLY. UAPB AND UAMS WILL LEAD THE EVALUATION USING THE CDC?S FRAMEWORK FOR PROGRAM EVALUATION IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS FRAMEWORK USES A COMMUNITY-ENGAGED APPROACH AND INCLUDES THE FULL INVOLVEMENT OF PROGRAM PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE EVALUATION PROCESS. THE PROJECT EVALUATION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE REACH INTERVENTION WAS IMPLEMENTED AS PLANNED, WHETHER IT REACHED THE TARGET POPULATION DESCRIBED IN THE DISPARITY IMPACT STATEMENT, AND WHETHER THERE WERE ANY CHANGES IN THE ACCESS, USE, AND OUTCOMES OF COVID-19 VACCINATION, TESTING, CONTACT TRACING, PREVENTIVE BEHAVIORS AND IF THOSE CHANGES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE REACH INTERVENTION. THE EVALUATION WILL PROVIDE DATA STRATIFIED BY DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND TIE THE VALUATION TO HP 2030.UAMS LEAD DR. PEARL MCELFISH IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING.
