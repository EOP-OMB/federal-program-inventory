BOTH SUTTER COAST HOSPITAL AND SUTTER SANTA ROSA REGIONAL HOSPITAL ARE AFFILIATES OF THE SUTTER HEALTH ORGANIZATION. THE MISSION OF THE ORGANIZATION IS TO \u201cENHANCE THE WELL-BEING OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE THROUGH A NOT-FOR-PROFIT COMMITMENT TO COMPASSION AND EXCELLENCE IN HEALTHCARE SERVICE.\u201d BOTH DEL NORTE COUNTY, CA, AND CURRY COUNTY, OR WHICH COMPRISES MOST OF THE HOSPITAL\u2019S SERVICE AREA, ARE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS, AND HEALTH PROFESSIONS SHORTAGE AREAS FOR PRIMARY CARE, DENTAL HEALTH, AND MENTAL HEALTH. THE POPULATION OF DEL NORTE COUNTY SUFFERS DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM HEALTH DISPARITIES, INCLUDING A LACK OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS (RATIO 2,985 RESIDENTS: 1 PROVIDER). THE SERVICE AREA\u2019S PREMATURE AGE-ADJUSTED MORTALITY IS TWICE AS HIGH AS THE OVERALL RATE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE FAMILY MEDICINE RTT PROGRAM IS TO ADDRESS THE PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE IN DEL NORTE COUNTY AND TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF THE COUNTY\u2019S POPULATION, FOR WHOM ACCE SS TO PRIMARY HEALTH CARE IS LIMITED. SSRRH WILL SERVE AS THE URBAN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF TRAINING, AND SCH AS THE RURAL SETTING WHERE THE FINAL TWO YEARS OF TRAINING WILL OCCUR. RESIDENTS WILL RETURN TO SSRRH DURING THEIR SECOND AND THIRD YEARS ONLY IF THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET VOLUME REQUIREMENTS IN SPECIALTIES NOT AVAILABLE IN THE RURAL SETTING. THE FM RTT RESIDENTS WILL SPEND MORE THAN 51% OF THEIR TIME AT RURAL SCH, PROVIDING THEM WITH THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO MEET PATIENTS\u2019 COMPLEX HEALTH CARE NEEDS IN RURAL UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN SCH AND SSRRH WILL HELP ADDRESS THE GROWING NEED FOR FAMILY MEDICINE SERVICES IN RURAL DEL NORTE COUNTY BY IMMEDIATELY CREATING MORE RESIDENT PROVIDERS WHO CAN OFFER A CONTINUITY IN OUTPATIENT PRACTICE STARTING IN YEAR 2 OF TRAINING, AND BE RETAINING GRADUATES OF THE PROGRAM IN THE SERVICE AREA FOLLOWING THEIR TRAINING, AS STUDIES SHOW THAT PHYSICIANS TRAINED IN RTT PROGRAMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PRACTICE IN THE RURAL SETTING. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND GOALS INCLUDE DESIGNING THE PROGRAM CURRICULUM TO MEET THE COMPLEX HEALTH NEEDS OF RURAL DEL NORTE COUNTY; HIRING QUALIFIED STAFF; SUBMITTING A NEW PROGRAM APPLICATION TO THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (ACGME) TO ACHIEVE ACCREDITATION BY JULY 1, 2023; RECRUITING 6 FM RESIDENTS AND RETAINING AT LEAST 50% OF THEM POST-GRADUATION IN RURAL DEL NORTE COUNTY; SUSTAINING THE FM RTT PROGRAM THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FUNDING STREAMS; PUBLICLY REPORTING ON RESIDENT CAREER OUTCOMES FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS AFTER THE FIRST GRADUATING CLASS. THE RTT WILL SUPPORT 2 RESIDENTS IN THE FIRST YEAR, 2 IN THE SECOND YEAR AND 2 IN THE THIRD YEAR, SUPPORTING A TOTAL OF 6 RESIDENTS PER YEAR AT FULL COMPLEMENT.

THE PURPOSE OF THE WILLMARRTT IS TO PLAN AND DEVELOP A FAMILY MEDICINE RURAL TRAINING TRACK (RTT) IN WILLMAR, MN, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WHO TRAIN IN A RURAL AREA THEREBY EXPANDING THE PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE TO IMPROVE HEALTHCARE IN UNDERSERVED RURAL AREAS.   PROJECT GOALS ARE TO 1) PLAN AND DEVELOP A NEW FAMILY MEDICINE RTT AT CARRIS HEALTH (CH) IN WILLMAR, MN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ST. CLOUD FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM (SCFMR) THAT CAN HOST AT LEAST TWO RESIDENTS PER YEAR, AND 2) ENSURE FINANCIAL, CURRICULAR AND STRUCTURAL VIABILITY FOR THE RTT TO MAINTAIN AN ONGOING SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM LONG AFTER THE GRANT PERIOD ENDS.   MAJOR OBJECTIVES ARE TO 1) BUILD ON THE EXISTING PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN DFMCH AND CENTRACARE TO ENSURE A ROBUST ORGANIZATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL BASE FOR AN ACGME ACCREDITED RTT AT CH, DEVELOP A CURRICULUM FOR COMMUNITY ORIENTED FAMILY MEDICINE RTT THAT E NHANCES PRIMARY HEALTHCARE DELIVERY IN RURAL AREAS DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE FROM THE NATIONAL RTT COLLABORATIVE, AND THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES OF DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH (DFMCH) AND THE ST. CLOUD FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM, AND RECRUIT RESIDENTS FOR THE WILLMARRTT, 2) ENSURE APPROPRIATE ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE RTT FOR CONTINUED FUNCTIONING OF THE RTT, 3) DEVELOP A GRADUATE TRACKING PLAN FOR THE WILLMARRTT, AND 4) LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF SETTING UP AN RTT IN MINNESOTA IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE AND DEVELOP OTHER RTT PROGRAMS IN MINNESOTA.    THE PROJECT WILL BE BASED IN WILLMAR, IN RURAL KANDIYOHI COUNTY, MN, AND SERVE POPULATIONS IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTIES OF POPE, SWIFT, CHIPPEWA, RENVILLE, REDWOOD, AND MEEKER. THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ACADEMIA (DFMCH) AND A RURAL ORIENTED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, CENTRACARE, THAT HOUSES BOTH SCFMR AND CH, WILL BUILD ON EXISTING ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS IN CREATING A NEW FAMILY MEDICINE RTT. THE CLINICAL SITES FOR THE RTT INCLUDE TWO HOSPITALS IN WILLMAR (RICE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL) AND REDWOOD FALLS (REDWOOD HOSPITAL) AND THE 13 OUTPATIENT FACILITIES UNDER CH. WE WILL EMPLOY RIGOROUS AND TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATIONAL METHODS TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, DRAWING ON THE RESOURCES OF UMN, EMPLOYING TELEHEALTH AND OTHER INNOVATIVE TOOLS IN TEACHING AND CARE DELIVERY. THE RTT WILL RECRUIT MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE US INTERESTED IN RURAL CARE. WE WILL ALSO BUILD ON THE CURRENT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE RURAL PHYSICIAN ASSOCIATES PROGRAM (RPAP), AT WILLMAR, MN.  OUR PRIMARY MEASURE OF SUCCESS WILL BE GRADUATES OF THE RTT FUNCTIONING AS RURAL PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IN MINNESOTA AND ACROSS THE US.
