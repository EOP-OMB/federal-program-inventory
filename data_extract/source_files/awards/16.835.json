APD IS THE ONLY REMAINING LAW ENFORCEMENT BRANCH OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE BWCS. THE AGENCY HAS JURISDICTION OVER LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (LAX) AS WELL AS SURROUNDING COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS.

FIRST, A PROPORTION OF CAPTURED VIDEO WILL BE REVIEWED IN ORDER TO PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY POTENTIAL TRAINING ISSUES BEFORE THEY RESULT IN NEGATIVE OUTCOMES IN THE FIELD. SECONDLY, THE CURRENT PROCESS OF RESPONDING TO CITIZEN COMPLAINTS IS INEFFICIENT DUE TO THE LACK OF ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY REVIEW PRIOR OFFICER BEHAVIOR. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BWCS WILL STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS BY PROVIDING VIDEO THAT CAN BE USED IN INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS AS REQUIRED.

HOWEVER, THIS AD HOC APPROACH TO THE BWC PROGRAM LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED IN TERMS OF RELIABILITY, VIDEO AND AUDIO QUALITY, DATA STORAGE, AND USABLE DIGITAL MEDIA EVIDENCE. THEREFORE, AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE RENOVATION OF THE BWC PROGRAM, LSCO ENTERED A CONTRACT WITH LENSLOCK TO PROVIDE NEWER BWC FOR DEPUTIES IN THE PATROL DIVISION.

A MAJOR OBSTACLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF BODY-WORN CAMERAS IS THE ABILITY TO USE VIDEO REDACTIONS WHEN USED IN OPEN RECORDS. PRIOR TO THIS, BWC FOOTAGE HAD TO BE MANUALLY OFFLOADED AND STORED ON SERVERS AND BACK-UP DISKS. THERE WAS NO OPTION TO REDACT FOOTAGE MEANING THAT SOME VIDEO HAD TO BE WITHHELD DUE TO PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS. THE LENSLOCK CAMERAS ARE NOT SHARED AS THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO ONE DEPUTY.
