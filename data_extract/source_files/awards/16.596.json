THE SERVICE AREA IS NATIONWIDE, AND THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES ARE SELECTED TRIBAL JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS THE FIELD AT LARGE.\n\nTHE CENTER SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED THE TRIBAL-SPECIFIC RNR TOOL DURING THE ORIGINAL AWARD PERIOD. IN DEVELOPING THIS TOOL, THE CENTER DREW UPON PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS,\u00a0EXISTING RESEARCH AND EXPERTISE ON RNR ASSESSMENT (INCLUDING EXTENSIVE INPUT FROM ITS ADVISORY COUNCIL),\u00a0AND EMERGING RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS ON ASSESSING RISK AND NEED IN THE AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE (AI/AN) POPULATIONS.\n\nTHE CENTER NOW SEEKS TO PILOT THE TOOL, GENERATE DATA ON ITS EFFICACY, IMPROVE THE TOOL AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS BASED ON PILOT RESULTS, AND FINALIZE THE TOOL FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION. THE PROJECT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN TWO PHASES: (1) A PILOT PHASE TO TEST THE TOOL IN 2-3\u00a0TRIBAL JURISDICTIONS; AND (2) A SECOND PHASE TO ANALYZE RECIDIVISM DATA, IDENTIFY PREDICTIVE RISK-NEED FACTORS, AND FINALIZE THE TOOL.\n\nWITH THIS PROPOSAL, 2-3 TRIBAL JURISDICTIONS WITH A RELATIVELY HIGH VOLUME OF COURT CASES AND APPROPRIATE DATA COLLECTION CAPACITY WILL SERVE AS THE PILOT SITES. THE CENTER WILL FIRST ENGAGE PILOT SITES IN PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH BEFORE PILOTING OFFICIALLY COMMENCES, REVIEWING THE TOOL AND DISCUSSING IMPLEMENTATION. THE PILOTING PROCESS INVOLVES 6-9 MONTHS OF ADMINISTERING THE TOOL TO CONSENTING DEFENDANTS BY EITHER THE RESEARCH ASSISTANTS OR TRAINED STAFF, WITH PARTICIPANT DATA COLLECTED AND SECURELY STORED.\n\nDURING PHASE TWO, RECIDIVISM DATA WILL BE TRACKED FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS ON DEFENDANTS WHO WERE ADMINISTERED THE TRIBAL RNR TOOL. ALL DATA FROM THE SITES WILL BE ANALYZED BY CENTER STAFF TO PRODUCE AN ACCURATE RISK-NEED PROFILE OF THE AI/AN POPULATION AT THE PILOT SITES. FINALLY, PREDICTIVE VALIDITY OF THE RNR TOOL WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE ANALYSIS OF THE SIX-MONTH RECIDIVISM DATA.\n\nTHE ADVISORY COUNCIL AND TRIBAL SITES WILL PROVIDE FEEDBACK BASED ON PILOT RESULTS IN ORDER TO FINALIZE THE TOOL.

WE DO NOT CONFRONT THE DRUG DEALERS AND THE ALCOHOL IMPORTERS. WE TRIED IN THE PAST AND THE POLICE OFFICERS WOULD QUIT BECAUSE OF THE THREATS MADE IN OUR SMALL VILLAGE.
