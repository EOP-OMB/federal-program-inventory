THE RECOGNITION OF COPPER, MOLYBDENITE, LEAD, AND SILVER MINERALIZATION IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE DIAMOND JOE STOCK INDICATES SUCCESSIVE ORE-FORMING EVENTS THAT ARE NOT ALL RELATED TO A TYPICAL PORPHYRY COPPER-MOLYBDENUM SYSTEM. HERE, THE RECIPIENT PROPOSE A DETAILED 1:24,000-SCALE MAP OF THE VARIOUS INTRUSIVE PHASES COMBINED WITH A MAP OF HYDROTHERMAL FEATURES AIMING TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVE TIMING AND GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MAGMATIC AND HYDROTHERMAL EVENTS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS OF NORTHWESTERN ARIZONA AND CONTRIBUTE TO ONGOING MAPPING EFFORTS IN THE BIG SANDY VALLEY. THE METHODS WILL CONSIST OF (1) A DETAILED FIELD MAPPING OF INTRUSIVE ROCKS, HYDROTHERMAL VEINS, AND RELATED ALTERATIONS, AND (2) DETAILED PETROGRAPHY OF POLISHED THIN SECTIONS TO CHARACTERIZE IGNEOUS ROCKS AND HYDROTHERMAL OVERPRINT.

ENERGY, AND HYDROCARBONS  NBMG CURRENTLY FOCUS  PRIMARILY ON 1 24,000 SCALE, DETAILED GEOLOGIC MAPS, BECAUSE OUR CONSTITUENTS FROM LOCAL, FEDERAL, AND STATE AGENCIES, THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE COMMUNICATED THEIR PREFERENCE FOR MAPS AT THAT SCALE  A LONG TERM GOAL OF THE NBMG MAPPING PROGRAM IS TO SYNTHESIZE THE 1 24,000 SCALE MAPPING INTO DETAILED 1 100,000 SCALE MAPS THAT WILL CAPTURE THE BROADER REGIONAL CONTEXT OF OUR PRIORITY FOCUS AREAS THE GEOLOGY OF NEVADA HAS LONG BEEN OF INTEREST TO RESEARCHERS AT ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND AT THE USGS WHO HAVE PRODUCED NUMEROUS NEARLY COMPLETE, UNPUBLISHED GEOLOGICAL MAPS  FY2022 FUNDING WILL ALSO BE USED TO SUPPORT THE PUBLICATION OF THESE LEGACY GEOLOGIC MAPS  NEVADA CONTINUES TO GROW RAPIDLY, MOSTLY IN THE LAS VEGAS AND

SURFICIAL MAPPING WILL IDENTIFY LANDSLIDES IN AN AREA THAT IS KNOWN TO HAVE HAD ABUNDANT AND DAMAGING LANDSLIDES IN THE PAST.DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMESTHE APPROXIMATELY 70 KM2 MAPPING AREA WILL BE COMPILED INTO A 1:12,000 SCALE GEOLOGIC MAP. THE DIGITAL COMPILATION WILL BE DONE USING ARCMAP 10.8, AND THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL BE DELIVERED AS AN ARCMAP GIS AND A GEOPDF, FOLLOWING THE FGDC CARTOGRAPHIC STANDARD AND THE GEMS DATABASE SCHEMA.INTENDED BENEFICIARIESTHIS WORK IS BEING DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE NORTH CAROLINA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND WILL BENEFIT THEIR ONGOING EFFORTS IN GEOLOGIC MAPPING. THE MAPS WILL ALSO BENEFIT THE RESIDENTS OF THE PROPOSED MAPPING AREA BY PROVIDING AN UP-TO-DATE GEOLOGIC MAP OF THE REGION INCLUDING LANDSLIDE HAZARDS.ABSTRACT SUMMARYTHE GOAL OF OUR PROJECT IS TO DOCUMENT THE EXTENT, DEFORMATION CONDITIONS, TIMING, AND DISPLACEMENT OF THE FIRST REGIONAL-SCALE NORMAL FAULT TO BE DISCOVERED IN THE EASTERN BLUE RIDGE (EBR) PROVINCE OF WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA. DEFORMATION IN THE EBR IS DOMINATED BY CONTRACTIONAL STRUCTURES CREATED DURING THREE PALEOZOIC OROGENIES. EACH OF THESE OROGENIC EVENTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER TERRANE ACCRETION OR SUPERCONTINENT ASSEMBLY AND THERE ARE NO DOCUMENTED PALEOZOIC RIFTING EVENTS IN THE EBR. OUR RECENT WORK, HOWEVER, HAS REVEALED THE EXISTENCE OF A MAJOR DUCTILE FAULT WITH EXTENSIONAL (NORMAL) MOTION. KINEMATIC INDICATORS SHOW THIS FAULT, WHICH HAVE BEEN NAMED THE GRASSY CREEK FAULT, IS A TOP-TO- THE-SOUTHEAST NORMAL FAULT THAT WAS INITIALLY ACTIVE UNDER AMPHIBOLITE-FACIES CONDITIONS WITH A LATER GREENSCHIST FACIES OVERPRINT. IN SOME OROGENIC BELTS, EXTENSION DURING ACCRETION AND COLLISION CAN ACCOMMODATE OVER-THICKENING OF THE OROGENIC WEDGE. IN OTHERS, EXTENSION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO OCCUR PRIOR TO TERRANE ACCRETION. IN BOTH CASES, EXTENSION HAS PLAYED A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THE EXHUMATION OF HIGH- PRESSURE METAMORPHIC ROCKS, SUCH AS ECLOGITE. THE EBR CONTAINS THE LARGEST BODIES OF ECLOGITE IN THE APPALACHIANS YET THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THESE BODIES WERE EXHUMED REMAINS UNKNOWN. OUR MAPPING IN THE TODD, DEEP GAP, GLENDALE SPRINGS, AND MINERAL SPRINGS, NC QUADRANGLES IS AIMED AT DETERMINING THE EXTENT AND MAGNITUDE OF DUCTILE EXTENSION IN THE EBR ASSOCIATED WITH THE GRASSY CREEK FAULT. THE MAPPING WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH GEOCHRONOLOGY AND THERMOBAROMETRY TO CLARIFY THE TIMING, MAGNITUDE AND TECTONIC SETTING OF THE EXTENSIONAL DEFORMATION. IN OTHER CONVERGENT OROGENS, LARGE-DISPLACEMENT NORMAL FAULTS WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN THE EXHUMATION OF ECLOGITE. THE GRASSY CREEK FAULT MAY HAVE PLAYED A SIMILAR ROLE IN THE EXHUMATION OF THE EBR ECLOGITE.

AS A RESULT OF THIS AND THE NEED TO ENHANCE DEVELOPMENT OF U.S. SOURCES FOR IMPORTANT NATURAL RESOURCES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR RELEASED A LIST OF 35 CRITICAL MINERALS WHICH INCLUDES CHEMICAL ELEMENTS, MINERALS, AND ROCKS. SEVERAL OF THESE CRITICAL MINERALS ARE FOUND IN ALABAMA. THIS INCLUDES GRAPHITE, RARE EARTH ELEMENTS (REE), AND VANADIUM WHICH ARE WIDESPREAD IN METASEDIMENTARY AND IGNEOUS ROCKS OF THE ALABAMA PIEDMONT. THE METAMORPHIC ROCKS IN ALABAMA ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD WITH VERY FEW ESTIMATES FOR THE CONDITIONS AND AGES OF METAMORPHISM AND MINERALIZATION. THIS LACK OF INFORMATION HINDERS EVALUATION OF IMPORTANT MINERALIZATION SOME OF WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH REGIONAL METAMORPHISM.

PHILIPSBURG IS THE 2ND MOST PRODUCTIVE POLYMETALLIC MINERAL DISTRICT IN MONTANA (AFTER BUTTE), WITH OVER 24 MILLION OUNCES OF SILVER, 36 MILLION KG OF ZINC, 408 MILLION KG OF BATTERY-GRADE MANGANESE-OXIDE, AND SIGNIFICANT LEAD, COPPER, AND GOLD PRODUCED FROM OVER 40 INDIVIDUAL MINES. THE DEPOSITS CONSIST OF VEINS AND REPLACEMENTS CUTTING GRANITE AND METASEDIMENTARY ROCK, AND ARE SPATIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH AN ALTERED INTRUSION THAT HOSTS PORPHYRY-STYLE MOLYBDENUM MINERALIZATION. THE MINES ARE SHUT DOWN, AND THE DISTRICT IS AT RISK OF BECOMING SUBDIVIDED AS A SUBURB OF THE SCENIC TOWN OF PHILIPSBURG. BEFORE THIS HAPPENS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DOCUMENT THE GEOLOGY OF THE MINING DISTRICT, AS WELL AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF HISTORIC MINE FEATURES, INCLUDING ADITS, SHAFTS, OPEN PITS, TRENCHES, MINE DUMPS, TAILINGS PILES, AND MILL SITES. A SET OF SAMPLES FROM EACH MINE AND/OR MINE DUMP WILL BE COLLECTED FOR PROCESSING AND GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE DISTRICT-SCALE ZONATION OF METALLIC ELEMENTS, AS WELL AS ORE AND ALTERATION MINERALS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW HIGHLY ELEVATED CONCENTRATIONS OF SEVERAL CRITICAL METALS IN ROCK THAT WAS DISCARDED, INCLUDING GALLIUM (GA), GERMANIUM (GE), INDIUM (IN), AND TUNGSTEN (W).ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 1) DIGITIZATION OF EXISTING INFORMATION ON THE GEOLOGY OF THE DISTRICT, INCLUDING DETAILED MAPS OF UNDERGROUND MINE WORKINGS; 2) NEW GEOLOGIC MAPPING, FOCUSING ON THE PRECISE LOCATIONS OF GEOLOGIC CONTACTS, STRUCTURES (FAULTS, JOINTS, FRACTURES), AND HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION; 3) COLLECTION OF REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES FROM OUTCROPS, MINES, MINE DUMPS, AND TAILINGS DEPOSITS; AND 4) MINERALOGICAL AND GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ROCK SAMPLES.THE MAIN DELIVERABLE OF THE EDMAP PROJECT WILL BE A DIGITIZED GEOLOGIC MAP OF THE PHILIPSBURG DISTRICT, WITH OVERLAYS SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION OF MINE FEATURES AS WELL AS GEOCHEMICAL AND/OR ALTERATION TRENDS.
