THE CORONAVIRUS PREFERENTIALLY INFECTS THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT (URT) OF ITS VICTIMS AND ESTABLISHES DISEASE IN THE LUNGS AND RESPIRATORY TRACT.  HUMAN TO HUMAN TRANSMISSION IS REPORTEDLY BY AEROSOLIZED DROPLETS CONTAINING VIRUS, AND BY CONTACT WITH CONTAMINATED SURFACES AND TRANSMISSION TO THE URT THROUGH HAND TO FACE CONTACT. EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND RESEARCHERS HAVE POINTED TO SOCIAL ISOLATION AND QUARANTINING AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO STOP TRANSMISSION UNTIL A NEUTRALIZING VACCINE IS AVAILABLE IN 12-18 MONTHS.  PUEBLO OF ACOMA TRIBAL COUNCIL ISSUED A #STAYATHOME ORDER IN EARLY MARCH 2020 TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE AND FUNCTIONALITY OF SOCIAL DISTANCING.  THAT ACTION EFFECTIVELY CLOSED ALL NONESSENTIAL WORK IN THE TRIBE. THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO ISSUED A STATEWIDE #STAYATHOME SHORTLY AFTER.

THIS ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE THROUGH POLICE RECORDS, HOSPITAL MENTAL HEALTH DIVISION CLINICAL RECORDS OF ENGAGEMENT WITH PERSONS, COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVITY RECORDS ETC.  THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS STILL HAMPERED BY: A) LONG GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES LEADING TO LACK OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND SERVICES; B) IMPAIRMENTS TO COMMUNICATION DUE TO LIMITED TECHNOLOGY; C) LIMITED ACCESS TO OUTREACH SERVICES AND RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE WITH MH AND SUD SUCH AS PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION AND REFERRAL; AND D) LIMITED LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

THERE NEEDS TO BE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND INORMATION DEVELOPED FOR THIS POPULATION GROUP BASED ON THEIR SPECIAL NEEDS. THERE NEEDS TO BE LOCKDOWN FACILITIES FOR THE PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES WHO CONTINUE TO ROAM THE STREETS NOT REALIZING WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND THEM.

WE WOULD RE-ALLOCATE SALARIES FOR CURRENT STAFF FUNDED USING TRIBAL MONIES DUE TO THE RECENT SAFER AT HOME THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED BY WISCONSIN GOVERNOR TONY EVERS, AND DEVELOP A PLAN FOR LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND GROWTH.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": 1740510.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "107b7569-4740-48df-31e2-7254911b2e1d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79FG000194_7522"}, {"internal_id": 107114161, "Award ID": "H79FG000193", "Award Amount": 498958.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-04-16", "CFDA Number": "93.665", "Description": "MARIMN HEALTH ER COVID-19", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "ID", "COVID-19 Obligations": 498958.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "94f569c0-094a-0db5-7627-19475e26340e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79FG000193_7522"}, {"internal_id": 107114618, "Award ID": "H79FG000192", "Award Amount": 500000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-04-16", "CFDA Number": "93.665", "Description": "ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 TO AMERICAN INDIANS IN CENTRAL OKLAHOMA.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OK", "COVID-19 Obligations": 500000.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "25a8542f-23db-7169-4abc-acf80e23df46-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79FG000192_7522"}, {"internal_id": 107114580, "Award ID": "H79FG000191", "Award Amount": 340102.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-04-16", "CFDA Number": "93.665", "Description": "ROUND VALLEY COVID-19 MENTAL HEALTH AND SUD RESPONSE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 340102.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6b193489-33d8-5e44-3fce-90756640f9fe-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79FG000191_7522"}, {"internal_id": 107114452, "Award ID": "H79FG000190", "Award Amount": 2000000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-04-16", "CFDA Number": "93.665", "Description": "NC EMERGENCY COVID-19", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": 2000000.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "44c05f0e-2559-a608-5a78-7cedb80b5c53-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79FG000190_7522"}, {"internal_id": 107114367, "Award ID": "H79FG000189", "Award Amount": 2000000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-04-16", "CFDA Number": "93.665", "Description": "EMERGENCY GRANTS TO ADDRESS MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS DURING COVID-19", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 2000000.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "409b3cbb-d2f5-f7b3-00db-2cdc91d0f1c9-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79FG000189_7522"}, {"internal_id": 123183120, "Award ID": "H79FG000188", "Award Amount": 751462.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-01-15", "CFDA Number": "93.665", "Description": "EASTERN SHAWNEE TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA SAMHSA: EMERGENCY MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS DURING COVID-19 - THE EASTERN SHAWNEE TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA (ESTO) IS LOCATED IN THE FAR NORTHEASTERN CORNER OF OKLAHOMA IN OTTAWA COUNTY NEAR THE RURAL TOWN OF WYANDOTTE. MAJOR TOWNS OR CITIES NEAR OUR TRIBAL HEADQUARTERS INCLUDE JOPLIN, MISSOURI (30 MILES) AND TULSA, OKLAHOMA (90 MILES). THE POPULATION FOCUS AND GEOGRAPHIC CATCHMENT AREA IMPACTED FOR THIS PROJECT IS NATIVE AMERICANS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITHIN A 50-MILE RADIUS OF OUR TRIBAL HEADQUARTERS NEAR WYANDOTTE, OK.  BASED UPON LOCAL DATA AND FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE FROM DEL CAMP, CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER WITH OZARK CENTER, THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRANCH OF FREEMAN HEALTH SYSTEM IN JOPLIN , THERE IS A LOCALLY IDENTIFIED NEED TOWARDS PREVENTING AND REDUCING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE, REDUCING THE IMPACT OF TRAUMA, AND PROMOTING GOOD MENTAL HEALTH.  THE NEED FOR OUR PROPOSED PROJECT STEMS FROM EVIDENCE FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH IS ON THE RISE. THIS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY PROBLEM IN OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITY AND FAR REACHING SERVICE AREA WITHIN A 50-MILE RADIUS THROUGH VARIOUS COMMUNITY MEETINGS, INTERVIEWS, AND STATISTICS. WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND A POOR RURAL COMMUNITY THAT WE LIVE IN, SELF ISOLATION HAS CAUSED THE INCREASE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND POOR MENTAL HEALTH.  AS THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK CONTINUES, AMERICANS EVERYWHERE ARE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. ACCORDING TO A NATIONAL POLL RELEASED IN MARCH 2020 BY THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, NEARLY HALF OF AMERICANS ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTRACTING THE CORONAVIRUS. NEARLY 4 IN 10 ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT BECOMING SERIOUSLY ILL OR DYING OF COVID-19, THE DISEASE CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS, AND ROUGHLY 62% ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FAMILY AND LOVED ONES GETTING THE CORONAVIRUS.  IN MARCH 2020 MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF AMERICANS SAY THE CORONAVIRUS IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH.  IN APRIL THAT STATISTIC INCREASED TO MORE THAN ONE HALF OF AMERICANS EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND IT IS ESCALATING DAILY. \u201cDURING THIS TIME, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAINTAIN SELF-CARE AND MANAGE THE STRESS,\" THE ASSOCIATION'S PRESIDENT, BRUCE SCHWARTZ, SAID IN A STATEMENT.  MAINTAINING MENTAL HEALTH IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC IS A STRUGGLE.  FUNDING OF THIS GRAND WOULD PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS TO DEVELOP POSITIVE COPING SKILLS.  ESTO ROUTINELY DEALS WITH A HIGH AMOUNT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE. TAMMY GIBSON OF OUR INDIAN CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT STATES THAT ALL BUT ONE OF HER MANY CASES INVOLVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE.  WE FEAR THAT WITH THE HIGH AMOUNT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE THE INCREASE OF SUICIDE WILL HAPPEN. WITH THIS FUNDING ESTO WILL BE ABLE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS DURING THIS COVID-19 PANDEMIC, TO HAVE A POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH AND TO FIGHT SUBSTANCE ABUSE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OK", "COVID-19 Obligations": 751462.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1ff4cd3e-989e-18c9-64cf-0cc49e77f93a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79FG000188_7522"}]
