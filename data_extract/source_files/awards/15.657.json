THIS INFORMATION MAY BE USEFUL TO UNDERSTAND POPULATION CONTRACTION RECENTLY FOUND IN MCINTOSH RUN, INFORM NON POINT SOURCE POLLUTION MANAGEMENT IN THREE BRIDGES BRANCH, AND EVALUATE LANDSCAPE RESTORATION PRACTICES IN THE BROWNS BRANCH WATERSHED. FIELD AND ANALYTICAL WORK WILL OCCUR FROM JANUARY 2023 DECEMBER 2024.RECOVERY OBJECTIVES UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT FOR DWARF WEDGEMUSSEL INCLUDE DOCUMENTING VIABLE POPULATIONS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME TO DEMONSTRATE STABILITY IN ABUNDANCE AND RECRUITMENT. THIS SPECIES EXISTS IN FIVE SMALL STREAMS IN MARYLAND  THE NANJEMOY CREEK POPULATION IS THE LARGEST AND EXISTS IN A MINIMALLY DISTURBED WATERSHED. THE POPULATION IN THE BROWNS BRANCH WATERSHED APPEARS TO BE IN DECLINE, BUT COULD BE RECOVERED BY PROPOSED LANDSCAPE RESTORATION AND POPULATION AUGMENTATION. AN UNDERSTANDING OF DWARF WEDGEMUSSEL DEMOGRAPHICS IS NEEDED TO MANAGE OR RESTORE THEIR POPULATIONS. THIS REQUIRES REPEATED SAMPLING (CAPTURE MARK RECAPTURE) FROM WITHIN HABITAT OR POPULATION OF INTEREST. WE PREVIOUSLY USED A ROBUST SAMPLING DESIGN AT FOUR SITES IN EACH STREAM TO ESTIMATE DETECTION PROBABILITY AND APPARENT SURVIVAL OF PIT TAGGED DWARF WEDGEMUSSEL BY MONITORING WITH A SUBMERSIBLE PIT TAG READER DURING FOUR SECONDARY MONITORING EVENTS IN TWO PRIMARY SAMPLING PERIODS (FALL AND SPRING) AFTER MARKING. A VISUAL SURVEY WAS DONE IN THE SUMMER PRIOR TO STARTING MONITORING AND AFTER THE SPRING PERIOD TO MEASURE MUSSEL GROWTH AND TAG ANY UNMARKED MUSSELS.WE RECOVERED A MAJORITY OF THE PIT TAGGED MUSSELS IN THE FALL, BUT RECOVERED LESS MUSSELS THE FOLLOWING SPRING, POSSIBLY DUE TO A COMBINATION OF TAG LOSS, IMMIGRATION, AND MORTALITY. WE RECAPTURED A LOW PERCENTAGE OF TAGGED MUSSELS IN VISUAL SURVEYS AT ALL SITES. THIS SAMPLING PRODUCED A DATASET WITH ENOUGH OBSERVATIONS TO ESTIMATE INTRA ANNUAL SURVIVAL AND DETECTION PROBABILITY BECAUSE REPEATED PIT TAG BASED MONITORING RECOVERED A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF MARKED MUSSELS. HOWEVER, THIS CAME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE EFFORT NEEDED TO RECAPTURE MUSSELS. A CHANGE IN THE SAMPLING DESIGN IS WARRANTED TO COLLECT THIS DATA. IN 2023, WE PROPOSE USING REPEATED VISUAL AT TWO OF FOUR MONITORING SITES IN EACH STREAM TO IMPROVE RECAPTURE RATES TO BETTER QUANTIFY GROWTH RATES AND ESTIMATE POPULATION SIZE. AFTER THE VISUAL SURVEY, WE WILL USE THE PIT TAG READER TO ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE UNDETECTED MUSSELS. A SINGLE VISUAL SURVEY IN THE SUMMER WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE OTHER TWO SITES IN EACH STREAM. BY CONTINUING THIS STUDY, WE WILL OBTAIN 1) A THIRD YEAR OF DATA ON POPULATION SIZE AND GROWTH IN NANJEMOY CREEK 2) A SECOND YEAR OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FOR BROWNS BRANCH PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING LANDSCAPE RESTORATION PRACTICES.

THERE ARE ONLY THREE TINY POPULATIONS REMAINING, WHICH ARE GENETICALLY AND GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED BY URBANIZATION. THE MAIN RECOVERY ACTIONS FOR THE SPECIES CALL FOR PRESERVING EXISTING POPULATIONS AND THEIR HABITAT, AND FOR CREATING NEW POPULATIONS IN UNOCCUPIED HABITAT. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO SITES WITHIN THE SPECIES HISTORIC RANGE THAT CONTAIN ENOUGH SUITABLE HABITAT (E.G., YOUNG COASTAL SAGE SCRUB OR DUNES WITH LOW NON-NATIVE GRASS COVER) TO SUPPORT A NEW POPULATION. IN ADDITION, THE THREE EXTANT POPULATIONS ARE TOO SMALL TO BE USED AS A SOURCE OF INDIVIDUALS FOR CREATING NEW POPULATIONS. THEREFORE IN 2012 A CONSERVATION BREEDING PROGRAM WAS INITIATED BASED ON THE FEEDBACK AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN COUNTY, STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER PARTNERS, RESEARCHERS, AND COMMUNITIES THATPARTICIPATE IN PPM RECOVERY. DESPITE PROGRAM SUCCESSES IN PRODUCING PPM IN CAPTIVITY AND FOUNDING A NEW POPULATION IN THE LAGUNA COAST WILDERNESS PARK, MAJOR HURDLES REMAIN FOR THE SPECIES. WE DO NOT YET KNOW THE OPTIMAL WAY TO RESTORE AND MANAGE RELEASE SITES TO ENCOURAGE PPM POPULATION ESTABLISHMENT. ALSO, GENETIC DIVERSITY IN THE REMAINING WILD POPULATIONS IS DECLINING, AND REINTRODUCTION METHODS NEED TO BE OPTIMIZED BEFORE NEW POPULATIONS WILL BE SELF-SUFFICIENT. WITH THIS PROPOSAL, WE AIM TO SUPPORT THE BREEDING AND REINTRODUCTION PROCESS FOR PPM, SAFEGUARD REMAINING GENETIC DIVERSITY, AND OUTLINE A PATH FOR THE BREAKTHROUGHS IN HABITAT RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT IN A HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPE WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL FOR PPM POPULATION CREATION, LONG-TERM SURVIVAL, AND RESILIENCY. SPECIFICALLY, WE (SAN DIEGO ZOO WILDLIFE ALLIANCE) HAVE THREE MAIN AIMS WHICH WE WILL PURSUE IN CLOSE COLLABORATION AND CONSULTATION WITH MANY PARTNERS, INCLUDING UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE, ORANGE COUNTY PARKS AND THE SAN DIEGO NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM. FIRST, USING RESEARCH TO FILL INFORMATION GAPS ON THE SPECIES NATURAL HISTORY, WE WILL CREATE A ROADMAP FOR PRODUCING LARGE NUMBERS OF BEHAVIORALLY FIT AND GENETICALLY REPRESENTATIVE PPM FOR REINTRODUCTIONS. WE WILL OPTIMIZE CONSERVATION BREEDING TO ENCOMPASS GREATER GENETIC DIVERSITY, ADDING 10 WILD PPM TO THE BREEDING PROGRAM, AND USING CUTTING EDGE HUSBANDRY, ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY, GENETIC MONITORING AND ENDOCRINE TECHNIQUES. SECOND, WE WILL IMPROVE OUR METHODS FOR PREPARING PPM FOR REINTRODUCTION, AND FOR RESTORING AND MANAGING SELECTED RELEASE SITES SO THAT THE TWO NEW RELEASED POPULATIONS WE PLAN TO INITIATE (EACH WITH UP TO 50 FOUNDER MICE) WILL HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF ESTABLISHING AND PERSISTING. SHORT-TERM, SUMMER SURVIVAL FOLLOWING PREVIOUS REINTRODUCTIONS HAS BEEN HIGH DUE TO POST-RELEASE SUPPORT, SUCH AS SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING AND PROTECTION FROM PREDATORS. BY OPTIMIZING HOW WE BEHAVIORALLY TRAIN PPM FOR THE CHALLENGES OF THE WILD, WHICH WILL HELP THEM SURVIVE WINTER, WE HOPE TO SEE THE RELEASED POPULATION BOOM. FINALLY, WE NEED TO IMPROVE LONGER TERMMANAGEMENT OF RELEASE SITES, WHICH WE WILL ONLY UNDERSTAND VIA MONITORING BOTH PPM AND THE SURROUNDING HABITAT. FOR INSTANCE, WE ARE HEAVILY RELIANT ON HUMAN MANAGEMENT OF RELEASE SITES, TO REDUCE PREDATION, AND OFFER SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD. WE WILL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO STEP BACK FROM THESE SUPPORTS TO HELP PPM BECOME INDEPENDENT AND CREATE RESILIENT NEW POPULATIONS. TOGETHER THESE THREE AIMS WILL HELP ACHIEVE THE CONSERVATION AND BREEDING PROGRAM GOAL OF CREATING THREE NEW POPULATIONS FROM ANIMALS PRODUCED IN CAPTIVITY.

THIS SUBSPECIES IS CURRENTLY FEDERALLY ENDANGERED, STATE FULLY PROTECTED AND HAS ONE OF THE SMALLEST RANGES OF ANY ENDANGERED SPECIES. THE SINGLE LARGEST FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE ENDANGERED STATUS IS THE DESTRUCTION OF HABITAT, RESULTING IN HIGHLY FRAGMENTED POPULATIONS WITHIN THE SPECIES RANGE. OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, SEVERAL RECOVERY ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, STABILIZING AND BOLSTERING THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, OVER THE SAME TIMEFRAME, POPULATIONS IN MONTEREY COUNTY HAVE STEADILY DECREASED AND POPULATION EXTINCTIONS CONTINUE TO OCCUR. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE ONLY FIVE KNOWN FUNCTIONAL BREEDING SITES LEFT WITHIN MONTEREY COUNTY. AS MONTEREY COUNTY POPULATIONS CONTINUE TO DECLINE, LOW GENETIC DIVERSITY AND INBREEDING HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS MAJOR THREATS TO SCLTS POPULATIONS. POPULATIONS WITH LOW GENETIC DIVERSITY, MEANING THEY POSSESS FEWER UNIQUE ALLELES FOR EACH GENE, CANNOT RESPOND TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS. THEY CANNOT ENDURE STOCHASTIC EVENTS, LIKE DROUGHTS AND WILDFIRES, AND THEY ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO LOCAL EXTINCTIONS.

POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM PET OWNERS ABOUT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THROUGH INTERACTIONS IN THE FIELD, HOWEVER THERE IS A NEED TO REVIVE OUTREACH AND MARKETING MATERIALS TO SUSTAIN PUBLIC SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH MAINE AUDUBON HAS A BUDGET FOR PIPING PLOVER CONSERVATION, THE GROWING POPULATION OF PIPING PLOVERS IN THE STATE HAS REQUIRED THAT THE LIMITED EXISTING FUNDING BE PRIMARILY ALLOTTED TO FIELD MONITORING AT THE EXPENSE OF OUTREACH AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH PIPING PLOVER NUMBERS IN MAINE ARE THE HIGHEST THEY VE BEEN SINCE MONITORING BEGAN IN 1981, THEIR POPULATION STATUS REMAINS PRECARIOUS, AND THEY CONTINUE TO NEED INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT. ONE OF THE MAJOR THREATS TO PIPING PLOVERS IN MAINE COMES FROM UNLEASHED DOGS AND OUTDOOR CATS, WHICH BOTH CAN CAUSE PLOVER MORTALITY AND NESTING DISRUPTIONS. SEVERAL IMPORTANT NESTING BEACHES ALLOW UNLEASHED DOGS, WHILE OTHERS HAVE LEASH RULES THAT THEY STRUGGLE TO ENFORCE. MAINE AUDUBON STAFF HAVE FOUND THAT THE BEST WAY TO CHANGE THESE BEHAVIORS IS THROUGH THE COMMUNITY ITSELF, AND THAT GIVING A STRONGER VOICE TO PET OWNERS THAT ARE COMMITTED TO CONSERVATION HELPS FOSTER A CULTURE OF PLOVER FRIENDLY BEHAVIORS.

IN OREGON, SAGE-GROUSE POPULATIONS IN THE BAKER AND COW LAKES PRIORITY AREAS OF CONSERVATION (PACS) HAVE DRAMATICALLY DECLINED OVER THE PAST DECADE RESULTING IN CROSSING ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT THRESHOLDS FOR THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (BLM). OREGON DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (ODFW), OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU), AND A RECENT REGIONAL STUDY HAVE QUANTIFIED HIGH DENSITIES OF RAVENS IN THESE PACS. THIS PROPOSAL IS TO PARTIALLY FUND THE TREATMENT PORTION OF A LONG-TERM STUDY (2017-2024) ASSESSING THE BENEFITS OF LETHAL AND NON-LETHAL RAVEN MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO BENEFIT SAGE-GROUSE NEAR AND WITHIN THE BAKER AND COW LAKES SAGE-GROUSE PACS, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DIRECTLY EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF LETHAL AND NON-LETHAL RAVEN MANAGEMENT ACTIONS BY QUANTIFYING LOCAL RAVEN ABUNDANCE AND OCCUPANCY DIRECTLY BEFORE AND AFTER MANAGEMENT ACTIONS. THIS PROJECT HAS AND CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH DENSITIES OF RAVENS, RAVEN HABITAT USE (MOVEMENT, FORAGING HABITAT, AND NEST-SITES), AND RAVEN NEST SUCCESS.

HOWEVER, SUCCESSFULLY REINTRODUCING VOLES APPEARS TO REQUIRE AN ELABORATE PROCESS OF PAIRING A CAPTIVE VOLE WITH A WILD VOLE FOR A RELATIVELY PROLONGED PERIOD IN CAPTIVITY, AND THEN PERFORMING A VERY GRADUAL SOFT RELEASE OF THE PAIR AT THE INTENDED SITE. THE COST-BENEFIT BALANCE TO THIS ACTIVITY DEPENDS ON HOW MANY RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR MANAGING THE COLONY, AVAILABILITY OF WILD ANIMALS PERIODICALLY TO SUPPORT COLONY GENETIC VARIABILITY, AND HOW STABLE WILD POPULATIONS ARE. AS OF EARLY 2022, WILD POPULATIONS APPEAR VERY SMALL BUT STABLE IN THE SHORT TERM. DUE TO THE VERY SMALL POPULATION SIZE, BLM (THE MAJOR LANDOWNER) HAS DECLINED TO ALLOW WILD VOLES TO BE REMOVED TO THE COLONY. IMPORTANTLY, GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT MAINTAINING THIS SPECIES IN CAPTIVITY, A NEW COLONY COULD BE QUICKLY RECONSTITUTED IN THE FUTURE IF NEEDED. AS SUCH, THE PRESENT PLAN IS TO STEP DOWN THE COLONY THROUGH RELEASES INTO THE WILD, SIMULTANEOUSLY OBTAINING DATA ON IMPACTS OF A RAPID FLUX OF VOLES ON NONNATIVE HOUSE MICE, WHICH ARE EXPANDING IN NUMBERS AND RANGE AMONG TECOPA MARSHES.

DECLINES IN RPBB ACROSS THIS SPECIES HISTORIC RANGE  HAVE RESULTED IN A NATIONAL EFFORT TO RECOVER THE SPECIES TO A HEALTHY AND STABLE REPRESENTATION OF  HISTORIC POPULATION LEVELS (USFWS 2021). A PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE RPBB RECOVERY PLAN INCLUDES IDENTIFYING  EXTANT POPULATIONS OF RPBB THROUGHOUT THE SPECIES' HISTORIC RANGE TO PREVENT FURTHER SPECIES LOSS AND TO  BUFFER AGAINST EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES, SUCH AS PESTICIDES AND PATHOGENS. THIS  PROJECT AIMS TO IDENTIFY EXTANT POPULATIONS OF RPBB IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION (CONSERVATION UNIT 3),  WHICH IS A NECESSARY FIRST STEP TO EVENTUAL DELISTING OF THE SPECIES (RECOVERY ACTION 4: ASSESS POPULATION  AND HABITAT STATUS AND TRENDS THROUGH MONITORING AND SURVEYS). THIS PROJECT PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK NECESSARY TO CONTINUE MONITORING AT-RISK BUMBLE BEE SPECIES IN MICHIGAN, OHIO, AND INDIANA AND ALLOWS  FOR THE EVALUATION OF UNDER-SURVEYED LOCATIONS HISTORICALLY OCCUPIED BY RPBB.

THE PROPOSED QUARANTINED REARING FACILITY WILL ALLOW SIHEK EGGS AND CHICKS TO BE  REARED UNDER PATHOGEN AND VECTOR FREE CONDITIONS, AND ALLOW BIRDS INTENDED FOR RELEASE TO BE PLACED REMOTELY FROM  OTHER ANIMAL COLLECTIONS AT BREEDING FACILITIES. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT TRANSLOCATIONS OF SIHEK DO NOT INTRODUCE  NOVEL PATHOGENS TO THE RELEASE SITE. THE QUARANTINE FACILITY IS ALSO DESIGNED SO THAT IT CAN BE MOVED BETWEEN AZA  INSTITUTIONS, OR BE HELD IN A CENTRAL LOCATION TO RECEIVE EGGS FROM BREEDING PAIRS SPREAD ACROSS THE US, TO  ENSURE RELEASED BIRDS ARE UNRELATED TO EACH OTHER AND MAXIMIZE GENETIC DIVERSITY WITHIN THE RELEASE COHORT.  THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO CONSTRUCT THREE RELEASE AVIARIES ON PALMYRA ATOLL, TO HOLD UP TO 9 BIRDS AT A GIVEN TIME.  RELEASE AVIARIES ARE REQUIRED TO HOLD BIRDS FOR A SHORT PERIOD AFTER TRANSPORTATION (APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH), SO  THAT BIRDS CAN RECEIVE SUPPORTIVE MANAGEMENT WHILE THEY BECOME ACCLIMATIZED TO THE NOVEL WILD ENVIRONMENT (I.E.,  A 'SOFT' RELEASE).  THIS PROJECT WILL REDUCE THE EXTINCTION RISK TO GUAM KINGFISHERS BY INCREASING THE TOTAL POPULATION SIZE THROUGH  INCREASING CAPACITY TO REAR SIHEK IN CAPTIVITY, AND BY SUPPORTING ESTABLISHMENT OF A WILD POPULATION THAT WILL  SUBSTANTIALLY EXPAND TOTAL CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE SIHEK POPULATION. ONCE THE ACTIONS IN THIS PROPOSAL ARE FULLY  IMPLEMENTED AND RELEASES TO PALMYRA ATOLL TAKE PLACE, THE CARRYING CAPACITY FOR THIS SPECIES WILL INCREASE BY UP  TO 20 BREEDING PAIRS, WHICH WOULD REPRESENT A 42% INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BREEDING PAIRS OF SIHEK, AND  MEAN THAT THE TARGET POPULATION SIZE OF 200 BIRDS CAN BE ACHIEVED (JOHNSON ET AL. 2015, NEWLAND ET AL. 2020).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "HI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b69d8f1b-143c-df84-9a9e-5088c0e975da-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F22AC01065_1448"}, {"internal_id": 147432458, "Award ID": "F22AC01038", "Award Amount": 116889.89, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-03-28", "CFDA Number": "15.657", "Description": "PROJECTS IN THIS NEW AGREEMENT IMPLEMENT THE TYNDALL INTEGRATED NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PLANS THROUGH  NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED ON TYNDALL AFB FOR MANY YEARS.

THE LOWER DESPLAINES RIVER VALLEY (LDRV) IN NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS SUPPORTS THE MOST THREATENED POPULATION KNOWN. DUE TO HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION, THE LDRV HINES EMERALD DRAGONFLY POPULATION IS ESTIMATED TO PRODUCE ONLY 80-320 ADULTS/YEAR. SMALL POPULATIONS IN FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO LOSS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND IMMINENT EXTIRPATION. THE REMNANT LDRV HINE'S EMERALD DRAGONFLY POPULATION IS QUITE UNUSUAL IN THAT IT RETAINS A HIGH LEVEL OF GENETIC DIVERSITY, SOMETHING THAT IS LACKING IN MANY OF THE LARGER POPULATIONS. THIS MAY MAKE THE LDRV POPULATION ESPECIALLY CRITICAL FOR THE LONG-TERM SURVIVAL OF THE HINES EMERALD DRAGONFLY WHICH FACES HABITAT ALTERATION DRIVEN BY DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THE LDRV POPULATION IS AT A POINT WHERE IT ALMOST CERTAINLY REQUIRES HUMAN INTERVENTION IF IT IS TO AVOID EXTIRPATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. INCREASING THE SIZE AND CONNECTIVITY OF ENDANGERED SPECIES POPULATIONS IS OFTEN ACCOMPLISHED BY ACQUIRING AND RESTORING DEGRADED HABITATS, OR BY CREATING NEW HABITATS. SUCH ACTIONS ARE DIFFICULT FOR THE LDRV HINE'S EMERALD DRAGONFLY POPULATION BECAUSE IT SURVIVES IN THE URBAN AND INDUSTRIAL CHICAGO REGION. AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH FOR CONSERVING SMALL POPULATIONS IS AUGMENTATION THROUGH THE RELEASE OF INDIVIDUALS RAISED IN CAPTIVITY. THE LIFE CYCLE OF DRAGONFLIES INCLUDES EGG, LARVAL, AND ADULT STAGES. DRAGONFLIES GENERALLY EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF MORTALITY IN THE EARLY LARVAL STAGES, ESPECIALLY SHORTLY AFTER HATCHING WHEN SURVIVORSHIP RATES CAN BE BELOW 0.1%. THIS MEANS THAT CAPTIVE-REARING LARVAE UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO GENERATE LARGE NUMBERS FOR AUGMENTING NATURAL POPULATIONS SIMPLY BY USING INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD HAVE DIED ANYWAY. PROTOCOLS FOR CAPTIVE-REARING OF HINES EMERALD DRAGONFLY LARVAE HAVE BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT FOR OVER 10 YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA IN COOPERATION WITH THE GENOA NATIONAL FISH HATCHERY, THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, AND THE FOREST PRESERVE DISTRICT OF DUPAGE COUNTY'S, URBAN STREAM RESEARCH CENTER. MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE, WITH OVER 120 ADULT HINES EMERALD DRAGONFLIES BEING RELEASED INTO THE LDRV POPULATION OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THESE EFFORTS BE MAINTAINED, BOTH TO BENEFIT FOR THE LDRV POPULATION AND TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE APPLICABLE TO THE HINE'S EMERALD DRAGONFLY OVER ITS ENTIRE RANGE. DESPITE THE INITIAL SUCCESS OF THE CAPTIVE REARING PROGRAM THERE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND THIS PROJECT USES A COMBINATION OF FIELD AND LABORATORY STUDIES TO ADDRESS THEM. THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE: 1) TO REFINE THE HED CAPTIVE-REARING PROTOCOLS TO INCREASE SURVIVORSHIP OF EARLY LARVAL STAGES TO GENERATE MORE ADULTS FOR RELEASE INTO WILD, 2) TO DEVELOP APPROACHES FOR MAINTAINING THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF LDRV BY DIVERSIFYING EGG COLLECTION SITES, AND THROUGH MONITORING FOR ARTIFICIAL SELECTION IN CAPTIVE REARED LARVAE, AND 3) TO ATTEMPT TO ENHANCE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF EXISTING HABITAT BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CRAYFISH BURROWS WHICH PROVIDE ESSENTIAL DROUGHT AND OVERWINTERING REFUGIA FOR HINE'S EMERALD DRAGONFLY LARVAE. CAPTIVE REARING WAS THE TOP PRIORITY IN THE 5-YEAR REVIEW OF THE STATUS OF THE HINE'S EMERALD DRAGONFLY AND THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES VARIOUS HIGH PRIORITY ACTIONS IN THE RECOVERY PLAN. COLLECTIVELY THIS PROJECT IS DIRECTED AT INCREASING THE VIABILITY AND PRESERVING THE HIGH GENETIC DIVERSITY OF THE LDRV HINES EMERALD DRAGONFLY POPULATION WHILE DEVELOPING CONSERVATION APPROACHES THAT ARE FULLY APPLICABLE TO THE HINES EMERALD DRAGONFLY ACROSS ITS RANGE WHERE POPULATIONS ARE OF UNKNOWN SIZE AND STATUS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4158b581-4997-96f0-c233-8a235aa0dfd5-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F22AC00780_1448"}, {"internal_id": 146647657, "Award ID": "F22AC00755", "Award Amount": 483526.5, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-02-22", "CFDA Number": "15.657", "Description": "CONTINUE WORK INVOLVING EROSION CONTROL AND WETLAND MANAGEMENT, INVASIVE SPECIES CONTROL AND HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fb9b9520-f5c8-3051-44a0-5fc75fdc84ec-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F22AC00755_1448"}, {"internal_id": 146954346, "Award ID": "F22AC00709", "Award Amount": 1554404.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-03-02", "CFDA Number": "15.657", "Description": "THE PROPOSED WORK WILL OPTIMIZE CONSERVATION BREEDING AND REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS FOR CAPTIVE-BRED  MOUNTAIN YELLOW-LEGGED FROGS (MYLF) IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
