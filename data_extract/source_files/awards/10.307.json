HOWEVER, MOST EXISTING CURRICULA DO NOT INCLUDE ORGANIC ANIMAL PRODUCTION, WHICH ALONG WITH EDUCATING THE NEXT GENERATION IS ESSENTIAL TO SUSTAINING ORGANIC AGRICULTURE. OVERARCHING GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO: 1) SUSTAIN AND SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF ORGANIC AGRICULTURE BY BUILDING COMPETENT PROFESSIONALS AND WORKFORCE, 2) ENHANCE ORGANIC EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AT LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITIES, 3) PROMOTE LEADERSHIP AND CAREER SUCCESS AMONG UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE. OUR GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY 1) DEVELOPING A SERIES OF COURSES AND MODULES TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE AND HANDS-ON EXPOSURE TO ORGANIC ANIMAL PRODUCTION, 2) DEVELOPING INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE EXTENDED EXPERIENCES AND TO HONE STUDENTS&#39; PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS, 3) DEVELOPING DIRECTED STUDY PROGRAMS TO DEEPEN STUDENTS&#39; KNOWLEDGE OF ORGANIC PRODUCTION, AND 4) PROVIDING LEADERSHIP AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE AND RELATED AREAS. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL DEVELOP TWO CORE COURSES AND SEVERAL MODULES INORGANIC ANIMAL PRODUCTION. ALL COURSES AND MODULES WILL CONSIST OF BOTH LECTURES AND LAB (HANDS-ON) ACTIVITIES. THE LECTURE SESSION WILL AIM TO INCREASE STUDENTS&#39; UNDERSTANDING OF FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRINCIPLES IN ORGANIC ANIMAL PRODUCTION; AND THE HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES WILL HELP STUDENTS APPLY WHAT IS LEARNED IN THE CLASSROOM TO FIELD SETTINGS. ADDITIONALLY,WE WILL DESIGN AN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AND A DIRECTED STUDY PROGRAM TO PROVIDE STUDENTS REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE IN ORGANIC ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND HONE STUDENTS&#39; PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS. FURTHERMORE, WE WILL FOCUS ON UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AND HELP THEM TO ACHIEVE THEIR CAREER GOALS THROUGH CONNECTING THEMWITH TRIBAL PARTNERS WORKING IN THE AREA OF FOOD SOVEREIGNTY.COURSES,MODULES, AND PROGRAMS WILL BE OFFERED ACROSS TWO CAMPUSES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. ORGANIC CERTIFIED FACILITIES (DAIRY, SWINE, POULTRY, AND STUDENT GARDEN) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA WILL BE USED FOR STUDENTS&#39; HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES.

PIGS RELY ON HIGH ENERGY AND HIGH PROTEIN DIETS TO ACHIEVE THEIR GENETIC POTENTIAL. TRADITIONAL FEED INGREDIENTS THAT CONTAIN HIGH ENERGY AND PROTEIN FOR PIGS ARE CORN AND SOYBEAN MEAL. THE PRICE OF ORGANIC CORN AND SOYBEAN MEAL HAS FLUCTUATED 2 TO 3 TIMES THAT OF CONVENTIONAL CORN AND SOYBEAN MEAL OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. SINCE FEED COST CAN CONTRIBUTE 65 TO75% OF THE TOTAL COST OF PRODUCING AN ORGANIC PIG, FEED COST HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PROFITABILITY OF ORGANIC PIG FARMING. IN ADDITION,ORGANIC BEDDING, WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR ORGANIC PIG PRODUCTION, IS RATHER COSTLY DUE TO THE LIMITED SUPPLY OF ORGANIC STRAW IN THE U.S. ONE STRATEGY TO REDUCE FEED AND BEDDING COST IS TO INTEGRATE SMALL GRAIN CROPS INTO ORGANIC PIG PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.

THIS WEED IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL EVEN BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS (USUALLY MEANING HERBICIDES) BUT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL USING METHODS APPROVED FOR USE BY ORGANICALLY CERTIFIED PRODUCERS. THE TENACIOUS NATURE OF THIS WEED IS LINKED TO THE EXTENSIVE ROOT SYSTEM, WHICH IS CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES USED BY ORGANIC PRODUCERS FOR WEED CONTROL. IN FACT ONE METHOD, TILLING, WHICH CAN STRESS AND DECREASE DENSITIES IN OTHER WEED SPECIES BY BREAKING UP ROOTS, MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE WITH CANADA THISTLE BY CUTTING UP ROOTS, ALLOWING THE INDIVIDUAL FRAGMENTS TO PROPAGATE NEW PLANTS. IN 2018 THE WESTERN GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION LISTED CANADA THISTLE AS THE THIRD WORST TERRESTRIAL INVASIVE SPECIES IN THE WESTERN US, AND SURVEYS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT ORGANICALLY CERTIFIED PRODUCERS CONSIDER WEEDCONTROL TO BE ONE OF THE TOP CHALLENGES FOR THEIR OPERATIONS. THESE FACTORS CAUSED US TO PRIORITIZE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL FOR CANADA THISTLE IN ORDER TO ASSIST ORGANIC PRODUCERS. WE HAD PREVIOUSLY WORKED WITH THE USDA TO DEVELOP A PROMISING CONTROL AGENT, A RUST FUNGUS KNOWN AS PUCCINIA PUNCTIFORMIS WHICH IS ALREADY FOUND IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. THE FUNGUS ACTS BY ENTERING THE ROOT SYSTEM AND EVENTUALLY KILLING THE PLANT, INCLUDING THE ROOTS, MAKING IT A VERY APPROPRIATELY TARGETED CONTROL METHOD. WE NEEDED TO IMPROVE TECHNIQUES FOR THE INOCULATION OF CANADA THISTLE PATCHES WITH THE FUNGUS, AND FOR THE INTEGRATION OF THE FUNGUS INTO ORGANIC FARMING PRACTICES. ANOTHER NEED IS TO INFORM AND EDUCATE ORGANIC PRODUCERS CONCERNING THE AVAILABILITY AND USE OF THE BIOCONTROL AGENT ON THEIR FARMS.THE PROJECT BEGINS WITH SURVEYS OF ORGANIC OPERATIONS IN COLORADO AND SITE VISITS TO FARMS AND RANCHES WHERE OWNERS ARE SEEKING HELP WITH CANADA THISTLE CONTROL. WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOUR OPERATIONS ON WHICH WE WILL INITIATE THE PROJECT. THISTLE PATCHES WILL BE INOCULATED ONE OR MORE TIMES WITH RUST SPORES IN THE FALL AND THE INFECTIONS WILL BE MONITORED AT REGULAR INTERVALS STARTING THE FOLLOWING SPRING. ONCE THE FUNGUS IS ESTABLISHED WITHIN A CANADA THISTLE PATCH DIFFERENT TREATMENT METHODS, INCLUDING MOWING AND TILLING, WILL BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RUST. THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF SUCCESSFUL CANADA THISTLE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL WILL BE A DECREASE WITHIN FIELD PLOTS IN STEM DENSITIES OF THE WEED. WE WILL ALSO MEASURE FLOWERING AND PLANT HEIGHT IN THOSE FIELD PLOTS. THE BEST METHODS FOR INOCULATION AND POST INFECTION TREATMENT OF CANADA THISTLE PATCHES WILL BE DETERMINED FOLLOWING CLOSE MONITORING OF TREATED THISTLE PATCHES LOCATED ON ORGANICALLY CERTIFIED FARMS AND RANCHES. BEST PRACTICES AND PROTOCOLS WILL BE SUMMARIZED AND DISTRIBUTED IN THE FORM OF PAMPHLETS, BROCHURES, AND VIDEOS. THESE WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE&#39;S WEBSITE AND THROUGH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND WEED MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS.

ORGANIC FARMERS CITE CULTIVATION, CROP ROTATION AND COVER CROPPING AS THEIR FOUNDATIONAL WEED MANAGEMENT TOOLS, BUT MANY CONTINUE TO RELY ON OUTDATED EQUIPMENT AND DO NOT DEPLOY DISTURBANCE AND CROP DIVERSITY IN WAYS THAT RELIABLY STRESS AND REDUCE WEED POPULATIONS OVER TIME. LOW AND VARIABLE CULTIVATION EFFICACY ARE COMBINED WITH ABUNDANT WEED SEED RAIN, RESULTING IN STABLE, OR MORE COMMONLY, INCREASING WEED DENSITIES OVER TIME. SIMULATION MODELS AND FARMERS&#39; EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT INDIVIDUAL ADVANCEMENTS IN CULTIVATION OR CROP DIVERSITY STRATEGIES ALONE CANNOT CHANGE THIS TRAJECTORY. HOWEVER, WE CONTEND THAT CULTURAL WEED MANAGEMENT FOCUSED ON WEED SEEDBANK-DEPLETING PRACTICES, COMBINED WITH ADVANCED, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND RELIABLE CULTIVATION TOOLS, CAN RESULT IN DECLINING WEED POPULATIONS OVER TIME. INTEGRATION OF SEED- AND SEEDLING-FOCUSED MANAGEMENT WILL EXPLOIT A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP: REDUCED GERMINABLE SEEDS -- REDUCED WEED SEEDLINGS -- HIGH LEVELS OF SEEDLING MORTALITY -- LOWER DENSITY OF MATURE WEEDS - REDUCED WEED SEED RAIN, AND THUS, CONTINUED REDUCTION IN THE GERMINABLE SEEDBANK. THERE ARE PROVEN WEED SEEDBANK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES APPLICABLE ACROSS ALL FARM SCALES, AND OTHERS THAT ARE MORE SCALE-DEPENDENT. TIMELY DISTURBANCE AND COVER CROPPING CAN ENCOURAGE GERMINATION AND SEEDLING RECRUITMENT TO DEPLETE THE GERMINABLE SEEDBANK. TIMELY TERMINATION OF CASH AND COVER CROPS CAN PREEMPT WEED SEED RAIN. SOLARIZATION OR TARPING HAS BEEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY ADOPTED BY SMALL-SCALE FARMERS AS A STRATEGY TO SMOTHER WINTER ANNUAL AND PERENNIAL WEEDS, AS WELL AS TO DEPLETE THE SURFACE GERMINABLE SEEDBANK, CREATING A STALE SEEDBED. HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WEED SEEDLING CONTROL, SUPPORTED BY SUPPLEMENTAL HAND WEEDING BOTH MAXIMIZE \"DEBITS\" TO THE SEEDBANK, WHILE MINIMIZING \"CREDITS.\" LIKEWISE, THERE IS A LARGE CULTIVATION TOOLBOX TO DRAW UPON, BOTH BETWEEN- AND IN-ROW TOOLS, AND EVIDENCE THAT \"STACKING\" TOOLS CAN IMPROVE MEAN EFFICACY WHILE REDUCING VARIABILITY, BUT FARMER ADOPTION REMAINS LOW. MANY OF THE TOOLS ARE MANUFACTURED IN EUROPE, AND THUS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DIFFICULT TO SOURCE. FARMERS ARE SOMETIMES SKEPTICAL REGARDING TOOL PERFORMANCE ON THEIR FARMS, WITH VARYING SLOPES, SOIL TEXTURES, STONES, AND RESIDUE. LOW ADOPTION IS DUE IN PART TO FARMERS, RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL ALIKE WHO TOO OFTEN PERPETUATE THE BELIEF THAT CULTIVATION IS AN \"ART,\" MASTERED ONLY BY SELECTED FARMERS FEATURED IN VIDEOS, BULLETINS OR SPEAKING AT WINTER MEETINGS. LASTLY, A LACK OF RELIABLE, EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH ON OPTIMAL USE OF THESE TOOLS UNDER DIVERSE SOIL, CROP AND WEED CONDITIONS INHIBITS ADOPTION BY RISK AVERSE GROWERS OF HIGH VALUE CROPS. OUR AIM IS TO WORK WITH INNOVATIVE FARMERS, EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND RESEARCHERS TO ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION. INTEGRATION OF WEED SEEDBANK MANAGEMENT (GALLANDT, 2014) WITH ROBUST, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ADVANCED CULTIVATION TOOLS (BROWN AND GALLANDT, IN PRESS; GALLANDT ET AL., 2018) WILL ESTABLISH A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP OF IMPROVING WEED CONTROL. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT REDUCED SEEDBANK AND SEEDLING DENSITIES WILL LOWER WEED SURVIVAL AND REDUCE WEED SEED RAIN THEREBY IMPROVING WEED MANAGEMENT OUTCOMES OVER TIME.

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO DEVELOP, THROUGH FOUR RESEARCH OBJECTIVES, AND PROMOTE, VIA EXTENSION PROGRAMMING, EFFECTIVE CCBNTS INVOLVING FROST-KILLED, SPRING-TERMINATED, AND LIVING MULCH SYSTEMS THAT COULD BE EASILY IMPLEMENTED BY SMALL PRODUCERS. THE PROPOSED SYSTEMS WILL FACILITATE BOTH TRANSPLANT-BASED PRODUCTION AND DIRECT-SEEDED CROPS. AN INNOVATIVE COMPONENT OF THE RESEARCH PROPOSED IS THE USE OF WINTER-KILLED TILLAGE RADISH TO MANAGE THE TRANSPLANTING ZONE IN BOTH LIVING MULCH AND SPRING TERMINATED SYSTEMS. FOR ALL FOUR RESEARCH OBJECTIVES, WE WILL QUANTIFY TREATMENT EFFECTS ON SOIL HEALTH, ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES, WEED SUPPRESSION/WEED SEED PREDATION, INCIDENCE OF SOIL-BORNE AND FOLIAR DISEASES, AND YIELD OF SUMMER SQUASH AND BEET CROPS. ANALYSES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF EACH SYSTEM.
