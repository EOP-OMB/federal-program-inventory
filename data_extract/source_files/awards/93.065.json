MODERNIZATION ALSO ALLOWS THE INTEGRATION TO BEST PRACTICE SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE SCREENING PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO OPTIMIZE PROCESSES AND WORKFLOWS FOR MOLECULAR NBS ANALYSES. SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE (1) UPGRADES TO OUR QPCR PLATFORM TO ALLOW THE INTRODUCTION OF IMPROVED DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHMS (DETECTION OR CALLING ALGORITHMS), THE INTEGRATION INTO THE LABORATORY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LIMS) AND INTRODUCING A SCALABLE QPCR FOR EXPANDED MULTIPLEXING, (2) THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CLOUD COMPUTING RESOURCES FOR GENOMIC ANALYSES AND DATA STORAGE, AND (3) INTEGRATION OF GENOMIC VARIANT RESULTS AND REPORTING INTO THE LABORATORY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LIMS).  SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE IMPROVEMENTS TARGETING MOLECULAR SCREENING APPLICATIONS AND SECOND AND THIRD TIER WORKFLOWS BY IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF EXISTING TESTS FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS (SCID AND SMA) WITH THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF EXPANDING THE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY OF OUR SCREENING LABORATORY WITH THE INCLUSION OF ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS OR MARKERS IN THIS PLATFORM. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SECOND TIER TESTING APPLICATIONS FOR SCID AS WELL AS THE DISORDER AGNOSTIC EXOME BASED NGS TESTING WORKFLOW WILL INTRODUCE EFFICIENCIES AND RESULT IN TURN-AROUND-TIME (TAT) IMPROVEMENTS.

ALL PRIMARY OUTCOMES WILL RESULT IN SCREENING PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING DECREASED TAT AND A REDUCTION IN REPEAT SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.  ACCURATE INTERPRETATION OF COMPLEX BIOMARKER PROFILES REQUIRES BOTH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANALYTIC AND INTERPRETIVE TOOLS AND TOTAL MANAGEMENT OF COMPLEX DATA SYSTEMS.

NEVADA IS A 2-SCREEN STATE RESULTING IN APPROXIMATELY 66,000 NEWBORN SCREENING SAMPLES SUBMITTED ANNUALLY.  ON JANUARY 1, 2020, A STATE LAW WAS ENACTED REQUIRING NEVADA'S NEWBORN SCREENING PANEL TO COMPLY WITH THE RECOMMENDED UNIFORM SCREENING PANEL (RUSP) AS DEFINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS) IN A TIMELY MANNER (PERTINENT EXCERPT BELOW): NRS 442.008  EXAMINATION OF INFANTS: REGULATIONS; PERFORMANCE OF TESTS BY STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY; DUTIES OF PHYSICIAN, MIDWIFE, NURSE, OBSTETRIC CENTER OR HOSPITAL; EXEMPTION.  THE EXAMINATIONS AND TESTS REQUIRED PURSUANT TO SUBSECTION 1 MUST INCLUDE TESTS AND EXAMINATIONS FOR EACH DISORDER RECOMMENDED TO BE SCREENED BY THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BY NOT LATER THAN 4 YEARS AFTER THE RECOMMENDATION IS PUBLISHED THE NSPHL IS APPLYING FOR FUNDING THROUGH THE ENHANCING DISEASE DETECTION IN NEWBORNS: BUILDING CAPACITY IN PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT.

NSPHL NEW TEST IMPLEMENTATION HISTORY/SUCCESS THE NEVADA NEWBORN SCREENING PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED (FROM SCRATCH) A COMPREHENSIVE NEWBORN SCREENING SYSTEM IN NEVADA ON JULY 1, 2014, WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTIES.  IT WAS CONSIDERED AN UNPRECEDENTED AND EXTRAORDINARY UNDERTAKING TO IMPLEMENT TESTING FOR 53 NEWBORN SCREENING DISORDERS, INCLUDING COMPLETE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP PROGRAMS, ALL AT ONCE.  ACCORDING TO VETERAN NEWBORN SCREENING EXPERTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, THIS MAGNITUDE OF NEW TEST IMPLEMENTATION HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.  IN 2018, THE NSPHL ADDED SCID TO THE NEWBORN SCREENING PANEL WITHOUT ISSUE.  AS A RESULT, THE PROGRAM IS CONFIDENT THAT THE ADDITION OF SMA AND X-ALD TO THE NEVADA NEWBORN SCREENING PANEL AND THE CONFIRMATORY TESTING FOR IRT WILL ENHANCE THE PROGRAMMATIC CAPABILITIES AND DECREASE THE TAT OF RESULTS TO BENEFIT BABIES IN NEVADA.  FURTHERMORE, THE ADDITION OF SMA AND X-ALD WILL RESULT IN NEVADA BABIES BEING AFFORDED THE ULTIMATE GIFT OF LIFE THROUGH THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OF POTENTIALLY FATAL OR PROGRESSIVE DEBILITATING DISEASE.

ON MARCH 4, 2022, THE SECRETARY\u2019S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON NEWBORN SCREENING (SACNBS) REVIEWED THE NOMINATION, AND VOTED UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOR OF ADDING X-ALD TO THE WI NBS PANEL. THE NEXT STEPS ARE THE SECRETARY\u2019S ACCEPTANCE OF THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE SACNBS COMMITTEE, AND THEN THE GOVERNOR\u2019S APPROVAL. AFTER THE FINAL APPROVAL, A RULEMAKING PROCESS WILL OCCUR, MAY TAKE UP TO 2 YEARS.  WE REQUEST FUNDS TO INCREASE OUR PUBLIC NBS LAB\u2019S CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO ADD X-ALD. THESE FUNDS WILL ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT NBS FOR X-ALD IN WI THROUGH A PILOT PROCESS BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATIVE RULE BECOMES EFFECTIVE. WE AIM TO IMPLEMENT NBS FOR X-ALD, AND TO RE-STRUCTURE THE TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY (MS/MS) NBS TESTING PROCESS NOT ONLY TO ENSURE SMOOTHLY INTEGRATING NBS FOR X-ALD INTO THE CURRENT ONGOING ROUTINE NBS WORKFLOW, BUT ALSO TO ENHANCE OVERALL MS/MS NBS TESTING.  SPECIFIC AIM 1: IDENTIFY NEWBORNS WITH X-ALD USING A FULLY VALIDATED NOVEL FLOW INJECTION ANALYSIS WITH NEGATIVE ION MODE TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY IN A TWO-TIER TESTING SETTING. C26:0-LYSOPHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE (C26:0-LPC) IS THE PRIMARY BIOMARKER USED IN NBS FOR X-ALD. WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED AN X-ALD SCREENING ASSAY TO MEASURE C26:0-LPC LEVELS IN DRIED BLOOD SPOT NBS SPECIMENS USING A FLOW INJECTION ANALYSIS (FIA), COUPLED WITH ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION (ESI) MS/MS PERFORMED IN NEGATIVE ION MODE. THE PRESENTED FIA METHOD SHORTENS ANALYSIS RUN-TIME TO 1.7 MINUTES, WHILE MAINTAINING THE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED ADVANTAGE OF UTILIZING NEGATIVE MODE MS/MS TO ELIMINATE ISOBARIC INTERFERENCES THAT COULD LEAD TO SCREENING FALSE POSITIVES. SPECIMENS WITH A C26:0-LPC VALUE GREATER THAN THE CUTOFF SET FOR THE FIRST TIER TESTING, A MULTIPLEXING MS/MS ASSAY IN POSITIVE MODE, WILL UNDERGO THIS SECOND TIER X-ALD SCREENING TEST. THIS METHOD WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED. IF WE IMPLEMENTED NBS FOR X-ALD AS A STANDALONE TESTING PROCESS, WE WOULD NEED SEPARATE AND ADDITIONAL INSTRUMENTS AND PERSONNEL. HERE WE PROPOSE A TWO-TIER APPROACH. USING FDA-APPROVED AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE MULTIPLEXING AS A FIRST-TIER TEST TO MEASURE C26:0-LPC (NEOBASE\u2122 2 NON-DERIVATIZED MSMS KIT). ONLY SPECIMENS ABOVE THE CUTOFF IN THE FIRST-TIER TEST WOULD UNDERGO THE SECOND-TIER ASSAY THAT UTILIZES NEGATIVE MODE MS/MS TO ELIMINATE ISOBARIC INTERFERENCES THAT COULD LEAD TO SCREENING FALSE POSITIVES. THIS TWO-TIER TESTING APPROACH WILL LEAD TO A HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC OUTCOME FOR X-ALD TESTING.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: IMPROVE MS/MS NBS TESTING EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE THROUGH MULTIPLEXING AND TWO-TIER TESTING ALGORITHM. THE TWO-TIER TESTING STRATEGY ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO MULTIPLEX ADDITIONAL SUCCINYLACETONE (SUAC) WITH NEOBASE\u2122 2 NON-DERIVATIZED MSMS KIT. IN WI, A STANDALONE PROCESS TO MEASURE SUAC IS CURRENTLY DONE IN NBS FOR TYROSINEMIA TYPE I. SIMILAR TO NBS FOR X-ALD, ONLY SPECIMENS WITH A SUAC VALUE ABOVE THE CUTOFF WILL UNDERGO SUAC MEASUREMENT USING A CALIBRATION CURVE BASED QUANTITATION. MULTIPLEXING STRATEGY WILL CERTAINLY PROVIDE THE EFFICACY NEEDED IN A HIGH THROUGHPUT PUBLIC HEALTH NBS LABORATORY, BUT ONLY IF COUPLED WITH THE SECOND TIER TESTING WILL IT NOT COMPROMISE THE SCREENING PERFORMANCE WITH LOW FALSE POSITIVE RATES.  BY THE END OF THIS TWO-YEAR FUNDING CYCLE, WE WILL ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING: 1. ESTABLISH A HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND HIGHLY SPECIFIC TWO-TIER NBS FOR X-ALD TEST ALGORITHM WITH 90,000 NEWBORNS SCREENED FOR X-ALD. 2.
