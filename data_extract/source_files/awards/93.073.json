DEVELOPMENT. PEDIATRIC CLINICIANS ARE IN AN OPTIMAL POSITION TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES FACING CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES DUE TO THE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS AND EARLY AND FREQUENT POINTS OF CONTACT THEY HAVE WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO STRENGTHEN THE PEDIATRIC HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE TO FOSTER A MORE COMPETENT, CURRENT, AND CONNECTED PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM, AND IMPROVE DELIVERY OF ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS (AAP) WILL PROVIDE CAPACITY-BUILDING ASSISTANCE (CBA) TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES AIMED AT IMPROVING: 1) PEDIATRICIANS\u2019 CAPACITY TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES LIVING WITH ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE USE, 2) PATIENT- AND FAMILY-CENTERED APPROACHES THAT ADVANCE ACCESS TO CARE, AND 3) IDENTIFICATION AND HEALTH OF CHILDREN LIVING WITH PRENATAL ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE EXPOSURE AND FASD.

THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL BE CALLED THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT PARTNERSHIP FOR HEALTHY PREGNANCIES AND FAMILIES (MAP). BOTH ENTITIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED TRACK RECORDS AND THE BANDWIDTH TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT MAP. SPECIFICALLY, CASAT HAS PROVIDED CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE, STATE-OF-THE-ART, EVIDENCE-BASED/INFORMED TRAINING AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ACTIVITIES, AND MANAGED LARGE MULTI-STATE, MULTI-ORGANIZATIONAL PROJECTS SINCE 1993 WITH A CURRENT BUDGET OF $10 MILLION IN STATE/FEDERAL GRANTS/CONTRACTS. THE AAMA (ESTABLISHED IN 1955) IS THE PREMIER ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO SERVING THE INTERESTS OF MEDICAL ASSISTANTS (MAS) AND IS THE ONLY ASSOCIATION IN THE WORK DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE MEDICAL ASSISTING PROFESSION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ASSIST THE AAMA MEMBERSHIP TO PARTICIPATE IN A COLLABORATIVE OF NATIONAL PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO: 1) REDUCING PRENATAL ALCOHOL/OTHER SUBSTANCE USE; 2) IMPROVING SUPPORT SERVICES AND ACCESS TO CARE; AND 3) INCREASING IDENTIFICATION AND HEALTH OF CHILDREN/FAMILIES WITH FASDS. SPECIFICALLY, AAMA/CASAT WILL USE THE REACH OF AAMA'S MEMBERSHIP TO EXPAND ITS CHAMPIONS NETWORK TO INCREASE ITS MEMBERS' USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED/INFORMED PRACTICES WITH A FOCUS ON AAMA SOCIETIES/CHAPTERS AND MA EDUCATORS TO: CREATE, DISSEMINATE MESSAGES AND RESOURCES; INCREASE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PRENATAL ALCOHOL/OTHER SUBSTANCE USE; INCREASE COLLABORATION OF PUBLIC/CLINICAL HEALTH PARTNERS; AND INCREASE LINKAGES WITH RESOURCES FOR CHILDREN/FAMILIES WITH FASDS.

SINCE 2014, AAMA AND CASAT HAVE WORKED IN PARTNERSHIP TO ENHANCE THE ROLE OF MAS AND PROMOTE PRACTICE/SYSTEM LEVEL CHANGE. THE AAMA/CASAT PARTNERSHIP HAS ACHIEVED IMPORTANT OUTCOMES DURING ITS TWO GRANT CYCLES (E.G., OVER 7,000 MAS COMPLETED A CONTINUING EDUCATION UNITS (CEUS) COURSE ON ALCOHOL AND MAS REPRESENT THE LARGEST GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS TAKING THE CDC-SPONSORED ONLINE COURSES). HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL TRAINING, SKILL DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTS, AND EXPANDED DEVELOPMENT OF CHAMPIONS NETWORK ARE NEEDED. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE NEW FOCUS ON LEARNING/PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES ON ALCOHOL/OTHER SUBSTANCE USE, ACCESS AND REFERRAL TO CARE, AND HELPING CHILDREN/FAMILIES LIVING WITH FASDS WILL ASSIST MAS IN THEIR ROLES AS ADVOCATES AND ESSENTIAL LINKS. BY THE END OF THE PROJECT PERIOD, ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED BY MAP ARE EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES: 1) DEMONSTRATED COLLABORATION BETWEEN CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS DEDICATED TO PRENATAL ALCOHOL/OTHER SUBSTANCE USE AND FASD-RELATED SERVICES; 2) IMPROVED CAPACITY OF STATE AND LOCAL NETWORKS TO REACH AFFECTED POPULATIONS WITH RELEVANT, EVIDENCE-BASED MESSAGING AND SERVICES; 3) INCREASED IDENTIFICATION OF AAMA'S MEMBERS' KNOWLEDGE, CURRENT PRACTICES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL NEEDS; 4) INCREASED USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED INFORMATION AND RESOURCES ABOUT PRENATAL ALCOHOL/OTHER SUBSTANCE USE BY MAS; 5) INCREASED USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED INFORMATION AND RESOURCES ABOUT PRENATAL ALCOHOL/OTHER SUBSTANCE USE BY MA EDUCATORS IN COURSES; AND 6) INCREASED KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO THE RISKS OF PRENATAL ALCOHOL/OTHER SUBSTANCE USE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NV", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "73a4ecd1-65ed-80de-ae3d-fa537fa2df50-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NU84DD000011_7523"}, {"internal_id": 68169742, "Award ID": "NU84DD000010", "Award Amount": 946784.16, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-08-28", "CFDA Number": "93.073", "Description": "FAMILY PHYSICIANS ADDRESSING RISKY ALCOHOL USE TO PREVENT FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KS", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "95365823-e9af-7090-1eee-c468f62d00fd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NU84DD000010_7523"}, {"internal_id": 68169338, "Award ID": "NU84DD000009", "Award Amount": 4306995.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-08-28", "CFDA Number": "93.073", "Description": "REACHING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO PREVENT FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS (FASD)", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": 3306995.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "395e4a2c-bac8-c9f0-4271-75643a4de192-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NU84DD000009_7523"}, {"internal_id": 68169542, "Award ID": "NU84DD000008", "Award Amount": 1000000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-08-28", "CFDA Number": "93.073", "Description": "FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS (FASD) MEDICAL ASSISTANT PRACTICE IMPROVEMENT COLLABORATIVE (MA-PIC)", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NV", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "73a4ecd1-65ed-80de-ae3d-fa537fa2df50-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NU84DD000008_7523"}, {"internal_id": 68171640, "Award ID": "NU84DD000007", "Award Amount": 1000000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-08-28", "CFDA Number": "93.073", "Description": "FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS (FASDS) PREVENTION PROGRAM", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "713017e9-58a5-3ea8-ee01-408ac82fc746-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NU84DD000007_7523"}, {"internal_id": 68167708, "Award ID": "NU84DD000006", "Award Amount": 1000000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-08-28", "CFDA Number": "93.073", "Description": "PREVENTION OF FASDS THROUGH NATIONAL NURSING ORGANIZATIONS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AK", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "60295d89-b22d-012f-5bda-efd5622a7a03-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NU84DD000006_7523"}, {"internal_id": 67580693, "Award ID": "NU84DD000005", "Award Amount": 1600000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-07-27", "CFDA Number": "93.073", "Description": "FASD -
