IT IS  ALSO ESSENTIAL TO THE RANCHING ECONOMY AND WAY OF LIFE OF MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON PUBLIC AND  PRIVATE GRAZING LAND. YET THE SAGEBRUSH ECOSYSTEM IS RAPIDLY CHANGING AND DECLINING IN AREAS DUE TO NONNATIVE SPECIES INVASIONS, CHANGES IN FIRE REGIMES, AND SURFACE DISTURBANCES.  THE WYOMING PORTION OF THE SAGEBRUSH SEA IS THE MOST INTACT OF THE REMAINING SAGEBRUSH HABITAT BOTH IN  EXTENT AND HABITAT QUALITY. HOWEVER, THIS REGION FACES THE LOOMING THREAT OF INVASIVE ANNUAL GRASS  EXPANSION AND INCREASED DEVELOPMENT FOOTPRINTS. SUCCESSFUL MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION OF NATIVE PLANT  COMMUNITIES, SUCH AS SAGEBRUSH AND NATIVE FORBS AND PERENNIAL GRASSES, IS KEY TO SAFEGUARDING THE  RESILIENCE AND ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE SAGEBRUSH ECOSYSTEM: PROVIDING HABITAT FOR BIODIVERSITY,  SUPPLYING FORAGE FOR LIVESTOCK, STORING SOIL CARBON AS PART OF NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS, AND PROTECTING  HUMAN COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRES. SUCCESSFUL RESTORATION OF DISTURBED, BURNED, AND ANNUAL-INVADED LAND  IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN THESE FUNCTIONS AND REDUCE THE RISK OF FUTURE ANNUAL GRASS INVASION AND WILDFIRE.  TO ENSURE THAT RESTORATION IS DONE WITH THE RIGHT SEED MATERIALS, IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS, WE PROPOSE  THREE INTER-RELATED AREAS OF WORK TO: (1) INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF NATIVE PLANT SPECIES FOR USE IN  RESTORATION IN WYOMING, (2) IMPROVE RESTORATION SUCCESS OF NATIVE PLANTS USING SEED-ENHANCEMENT  TECHNOLOGY, AND (3) CONVENE PARTNERS TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION RELATING TO NATIVE PLANT  RESTORATION IN WYOMING.  THERE IS CURRENTLY A SHORTAGE OF NATIVE SEEDS AVAILABLE IN WYOMING FOR RESTORATION, AND THIS IS AN  IMPEDIMENT TO SCALING UP RESTORATION TO MEET THE ANTICIPATED LARGER DEMAND IN THE FUTURE. TO INCREASE  NATIVE SEED AVAILABILITY, WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GERMINATE AND GROW SEEDS COMMERCIALLY SO THEY ARE  AVAILABLE IN THE LARGE QUANTITIES NEEDED FOR RESTORATION AND AT A PRICE THAT DOESN'T PROHIBIT THEIR USE.  HOWEVER, MOST HIGH-PRIORITY RESTORATION SPECIES HAVE UNKNOWN SEED DORMANCY. WE WILL STUDY SEED  DORMANCY FOR DESIRED SPECIES, WITH THE GOAL OF INFORMING SEED-BASED RESTORATION, SEED INCREASE OPERATIONS,  AND NURSERY PRODUCTION TO ENABLE WIDER AVAILABILITY AND INCLUSION OF THESE SPECIES IN RESTORATION EFFORTS  THROUGHOUT THEIR RANGE. RESTORATION SUCCESS FOR SAGEBRUSH - A FOUNDATIONAL AND CRUCIAL FORAGE SPECIES - IS OFTEN VERY LOW, WITH THE  GREATEST FAILURE AT THE SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT PHASE. WHILE SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT WILL ALWAYS BE A  CHALLENGE IN ARID LANDS, THE \"SEED TECHNOLOGY\" APPROACH HOLDS SOME PROMISE TO IMPROVE ESTABLISHMENT  SUCCESS. SEED TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVE MODIFYING SEEDS TO OVERCOME ECOLOGICAL ESTABLISHMENT BARRIERS. WE  ARE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A COMMERCIAL SEED TECHNOLOGY COMPANY TO DEVELOP AND TEST PROTOTYPES  FOR SAGEBRUSH SEED TECHNOLOGY. IN THE LONG-TERM, WE WILL NEED SEED TECHNOLOGIES TO BE EFFECTIVE, SCALABLE,  AND COMMERCIALLY-PRODUCED IF THEY ARE GOING TO INCREASE LARGE-SCALE RESTORATION EFFECTIVENESS AT THE LEVEL  NEEDED BY THE BLM AND OTHER LAND MANAGERS.  OUR THIRD AREA OF WORK INVOLVES PROMOTING THE SHARING AND SPREAD OF KNOWLEDGE ON RESTORATION SUCCESSES,  FAILURES, BEST PRACTICES, AND FUTURE INFORMATION NEEDS. TO THIS END, WE WILL CONVENE AND HOST A WYOMING  SAGEBRUSH RESTORATION SUMMIT, BRINGING TOGETHER A BROAD SET OF PRESENTERS, DISCUSSION LEADERS, AND  ATTENDEES FROM MANAGEMENT, RESEARCH, CONSULTING, AND OTHER RELEVANT ARENAS.
