POVERTY RATES FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN HEADED BY SINGLE-MOTHERS (38 PERCENT) ARE TWICE AS HIGH AS THEY ARE FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN HEADED BY SINGLE-FATHERS (19 PERCENT). POVERTY ELEVATES A CHILD?S RISK OF EXPERIENCING BEHAVIORAL, SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL AND HEALTH CHALLENGES. CHILD POVERTY ALSO REDUCES SKILL-BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES, UNDERCUTTING A YOUNG STUDENT?S CAPACITY TO LEARN, GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND MORE. ACCORDING TO KIDS COUNT DATA CENTER AS OF 2017, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 46,785 CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN THE TEXOMA AREA WITH APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THOSE CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY AS OF 2018. BETWEEN 2017-2018 THERE WERE 3760 STUDENTS ENROLLED  IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND ITS ASSOCIATED OUTCOMES ARE ALSO TIED TO MANY OF THE SAME STRESSORS AS OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN ARTICLE POVERTY DISTURBS CHILDREN?S BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCES STATED THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED DON?T PERFORM AS WELL IN SCHOOL BOTH LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CHILDREN BE GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND SUPPORT TO SURPASS THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. MENTORING PROVIDES THAT PROSPECT FOR SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES.

BECAUSE OF THIS HIGHLY DEVELOPED KINSHIP SYSTEM, MID NINETEENTH CENTURY LAKOTA PEOPLE WERE FELT BY SOME TO BE THE HEALTHIEST PEOPLE ON EARTH, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HAVING HORSES TO HUNT AMPLE HERDS OF BUFFALO.  AN OGLALA LAKOTA PERSON WAS CONFIDENT THAT DESPITE REVERSES IN HER FORTUNES, SHE WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF BY LOVING, CONCERNED RELATIVES. \n     THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC HIT PINE RIDGE RESERVATION ESPECIALLY HARD, AS THE OGLALA SIOUX TRIBE AND OUR SCHOOLS AND HEAD STARTS WENT TO EXTRAORDINARY MEASRUES TO PROTECT OUR ELDERS, MANY OF THEM LIVING IN MULITGENERATION HOMES, MANY WITH A DOZEN OR MORE INHABITANTS. OUR SCHOOLS AND HEAD STARTS HAVE BEEN CLOSED TO FACE TO FACE LEARNING, AND ONLY RECENTLY, WITH THE COMMENCING OF A MASS VACCINATION PROGRAM ON THE RESERVATION, HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE A CAUTIOUS RESUMPTION OF FACE TO FACE LEARNING.

YEARS OF RESEARCH ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND EARLY LEARNING SHOW THAT SEVERAL INTERRELATED AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT INCLUDE: APPROACHES TO LEARNING; HEALTH AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING; LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION DEVELOPMENT, AND COGNITIVE AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. THESE AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY BUILD ON ONE ANOTHER AND FORM THE FOUNDATION FOR LEARNING AND SOCIAL INTERACTION.
