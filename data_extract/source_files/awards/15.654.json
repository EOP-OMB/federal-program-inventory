EDNA DETECTION EXPLOITS DNA BARCODES, OR GENE REGIONS THAT VARY BETWEEN TAXA, AND CAN TARGET SINGLE SPECIES OR MULTIPLE SPECIES.

INTENSE WILDFIRE RESULTING IN CANOPY MORTALITY COULD SET BACK DECADES OF HABITAT RESTORATION WORK ON THE REFUGE. IN ADDITION, TRAVEL OF FIRE OFF-REFUGE COULD LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF PROPERTY VALUE ON SURROUNDING, PRIVATELY-OWNED PARCELS OF LAND.

"15.654", "Description": "COASTAL WETLANDS ARE HIGHLY ALTERED AND VULNERABLE ECOSYSTEMS DUE TO WIDESPREAD AND FREQUENT LAND-USE CHANGE COUPLED WITH SEA-LEVEL RISE (SLR), LEADING TO DISRUPTED HYDROLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, EXTENSIVE WETLAND MIGRATION AND LOSS, AND, ULTIMATELY, REDUCED COASTAL LANDSCAPE RESILIENCY. KNOWING WHERE AND WHEN CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED AND THE DRIVERS OF THOSE CHANGES, IS CRITICAL FOR PREDICTING AND MANAGING THE FUTURE OF COASTAL WETLANDS. YET, NATIONAL-SCALE ANALYSES OF CHANGE IN COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO UNDERTAKE DUE TO THE INHERENTLY DYNAMIC NATURE OF COASTAL SYSTEMS AND THE LOGISTICAL CONSTRAINTS OF IN-SITU DATA COLLECTION. THEREFORE, IN THIS PROPOSAL WE INTEGRATE NOVEL REMOTE SENSING TIME SERIES MODELING TO CHARACTERIZE THE CHANGES AND IDENTIFY DRIVERS OF COASTAL WETLAND CHANGE FOR THE CONTERMINOUS UNITED STATES (CONUS).THE CONUS COASTAL LANDSCAPE HAS A DIVERSE MIXTURE OF LAND USES, RANGING FROM MAJOR CITIES AND SUBURBIA TO BOTH INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL AND RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED NATURAL LANDSCAPES, AS WELL AS VARIED TYPES OF COASTLINES (E.G., COASTAL PLAINS, MAJOR ESTUARIES, BARRIER BEACHES, AND ROCKY SHORELINES). COLLECTIVELY, THESE INTERACTING CLIMATE, HUMAN, AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY INFLUENCE COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS. COASTAL WETLANDS IN PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE WIDESPREAD LAND COVER TYPE TRANSITIONS (WETLAND MIGRATION TO UPLAND AREAS AND LOSS, OR CONVERSION, TO NON-WETLAND LAND COVERS LIKE OPEN WATER AND TIDAL FLATS) AS WELL AS LAND COVER CONDITION CHANGE (CHANGE IN WETLAND ECOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGIC FUNCTION THAT MAY OR MAY NOT LEAD TO A COVER TYPE TRANSITION). WETLAND CONDITION CHANGES MAY SERVE AS IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF TIPPING POINTS THAT LEAD TO IRREVERSIBLE LAND COVER TYPE TRANSITIONS. GIVEN THE NATURE AND CONSEQUENCES OF WETLAND CHANGE FOR COASTAL HEALTH, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO MAP AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DRIVERS OF CHANGE, BOTH BETWEEN AND WITHIN COVER TYPES. OUR GOAL IS TO ANALYZE THESE CHANGES AND ASSOCIATED DRIVERS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO MANAGERS IN CONUS AND ENHANCE COASTAL WETLAND PROTECTION.TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS, WE WILL IMPROVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED APPROACHES THAT USE TIME SERIES ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE COASTAL WETLAND CHANGE FROM LANDSAT OBSERVATIONS FROM THE LAST 40 YEARS. LINKING THESE METHODS AND DATA WILL ALLOW US TO DISENTANGLE HOW MAJOR HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES ALTER COASTAL WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS THE CONUS. ALL AVAILABLE LANDSAT OBSERVATIONS FROM 1982 TO 2022 WILL BE USED TO BUILD A HARMONIC TIME SERIES MODEL TO TRACK THE 40-YEAR TEMPORAL TRAJECTORY OF EACH PIXEL AT A SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF 30 M  30 M. THE TIME SERIES-BASED MODEL WILL OUTPUT CHANGES (I.E., COVER CHANGE OR CONDITION CHANGE), COVERS (I.E., MANGROVE, TIDAL MARSH AND TIDAL FLATS) AND A SET OF POTENTIAL DRIVERS (E.G., HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, ALTERED HYDROLOGY, ACCELERATED SLR, AND EXTREME STORM SURGE) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS THAT CAUSE CHANGE.

METHODS THAT SUCCESSFULLY CONTROL THESE SPECIES EXIST BUT ARE DIFFICULT TO USE IN PRAIRIE SYSTEMS WITHOUT SEVERELY IMPACTING NATIVE FORB SPECIES. HERBICIDES ARE A CONTROL OPTION, BUT THEY INJURE/REMOVE NATIVE FORB SPECIES, THEREFORE THEY ARE RARELY USED. A NEW HERBICIDE, FLORPYRAUXIFEN, SHOWS PROMISE AS AN ALTERNATIVE OPTION FOR CONTROL. IT IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT CONTROLLING WILD PARSNIP AND WILD CARROT AND MANY FORBS HAVE TOLERANCE TO THIS PRODUCT.
