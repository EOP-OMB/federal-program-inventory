WITH THESE TOOLS IN PLACE, PIG MODELS ARE MAKING UNPRECEDENTED CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD UNRAVELING THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF HUMAN DISEASE AND DEVELOPING NEW THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES.

THE IMPORTANCE OF ANIMAL-BASED BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH HAS NEVER BEEN MORE APPARENT THAN DURING THE CURRENT COVID19 PANDEMIC. WORK WITH ANIMAL MODELS HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING DISEASE PROGRESSION, IMPROVING PATIENT CARE, DESIGNING AND TESTING VACCINES AND UNCOVERING THE ORIGINS OF THIS DEADLY DISEASE. THE CURRENT PANDEMIC HAS ALSO UNMASKED THE GRAVE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR NATION. THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF COVID19 ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANIC AND NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATIONS HAS HIGHLIGHTED A FUNDAMENTAL GAP IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW MINORITY POPULATIONS DIFFER FROM MAJORITY POPULATIONS IN SUSCEPTIBILITY, SYMPTOMOLOGY, AND RESPONSE TO TREATMENTS FOR DISEASES. THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP EXTENDS BEYOND COVID 19 TO ENCOMPASS VIRTUALLY ALL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. ONE IMPORTANT SOLUTION FOR ADDRESSING THIS GAP IS TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF RESEARCH, AND RESEARCH TRAINING, IN COMMUNITIES WITH LARGER MINORITY POPULATIONS. NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY (NMSU) IS A HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTION OF EMERGING EXCELLENCE LOCATED ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES, AN AREA OF HIGH RACIAL, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC DIVERSITY.

THE SUCCESS OF THIS INITIATIVE DEPENDS, IN LARGE PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN RELEVANT DATA FROM PREDICTIVE PRE-CLINICAL ANIMAL MODELS AND EFFECTIVE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH. ADVANCES IN MOLECULARLY TARGETED DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC AGENTS, THE CORNERSTONES OF PRECISION MEDICINE, REQUIRE RELIABLE TESTING IN INFORMATIVE ANIMAL MODELS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY. SMALL LABORATORY ANIMALS (RODENTS) COMMONLY USED IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH ARE OFTEN NOT SUITABLE FOR STUDYING PATHOLOGIES WHERE PHYSIOLOGY, HUMAN MARKERS, PHYSICAL SIZE, GESTATION LENGTH, LIFESPAN, AND OTHER HUMAN-LIKE FEATURES ARE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO DISEASE. USE OF LARGER ANIMAL SPECIES FOR RESEARCH, INCLUDING DOGS, PIGS AND SHEEP, CAN OVERCOME MANY OF THESE HURDLES.  IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT IN VIVO IMAGING PLAYS A PIVOTAL ROLE IN NEARLY ALL AREAS OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS ROLE WILL ONLY INCREASE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AGENTS AND THERAPIES. HOWEVER, IMAGING DATA OBTAINED IN SMALL ANIMAL IMAGING SYSTEMS CANNOT ALWAYS BE DIRECTLY TRANSLATED TO STUDIES IN HUMANS. CLEARLY, STUDYING LARGE ANIMAL MODELS USING CLINICAL SCANNERS WOULD PRODUCE DATA THAT ARE CLOSEST TO WHAT WE EXPECT IN HUMANS, AND WOULD BETTER INFORM TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES. FURTHER, THE ABILITY TO STUDY COMPARATIVE DISEASES THAT OCCUR SPONTANEOUSLY IN DOMESTICATED SPECIES, AS PART OF CLINICAL STUDIES OF CLIENT- OWNED ANIMALS, WILL ADD FURTHER TO TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE AND DATA OUTCOMES.
