THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PROMOTING AND IMPLEMENTING BMP THAT\nARE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING IN-STREAM CONCENTRATIONS OF TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLID (TSS) AND E.\nCOLI BACTERIA. THE BMPS HAVE VARIED IN SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE WITH MOST RELATING TO\nCONVERTING CROPLAND TO PERENNIAL GRASS COVER, WATER DEVELOPMENTS, GRAZING\nINFRASTRUCTURE, AND ROTATIONAL GRAZING SYSTEMS. A SECONDARY GOAL IS TO ALSO REDUCE MEAN\nANNUAL NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATIONS AT STORET SITE 385078\n2)KNIFE RIVER - NINE TOWNSHIPS WATERSHED: THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO RESTORE AND\nMAINTAIN THE RECREATIONAL USES OF THE KNIFE RIVER TRIBUTARIES WITHIN THE PROJECT AREA (HUC\n1013020106 AND 1013020107). AS A SECONDARY GOAL, THE PROJECT WILL ALSO BENEFIT RECREATIONAL USES\nIN THE MAINSTREAM OF THE KNIFE RIVER DOWNSTREAM FROM THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT GOAL WILL BE\nACCOMPLISHED BY REDUCING E. COLI BACTERIA CONCENTRATIONS TO STATE STANDARD LEVELS IN THE KNIFE\nRIVER TRIBUTARIES AND INDIRECTLY, THE KNIFE RIVER. LIVESTOCK GRAZING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT\nUTILIZE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TIMELY ROTATIONS SHOULD BE PROMOTED AND INSTALLED TO IMPROVE AND\nMAINTAIN A ROBUST AND DIVERSE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY ALONG THE RIPARIAN CORRIDORS AND IN THE\nUPLAND PASTURES. ADDITIONALLY, CONCENTRATED WINTER-FEEDING AREAS ALONG THE CREEKS SHOULD BE\nIDENTIFIED AND ADDRESSED BY IMPLEMENTING ON-SITE MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OR WINTERFEEDING\nROTATIONS THAT PREVENT MANURE ACCUMULATIONS AND ACCESS TO RIPARIAN CORRIDORS.\n3) IMPROVING WATER QUALITY WITH RANCHER MENTORING AND OUTREACH - PHASE III*: THE PRIMARY GOAL\nOF THIS PROJECT IS TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY, SOIL HEALTH AND CONSERVING NATURAL RESOURCES BY\nENHANCING LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THROUGH PEER-TO-PEER MENTORING AND COMPLEMENTARY\nPROGRAMMING. DRAWING FROM AN EXISTING MULTI-GENERATIONAL POOL OF RANCHERS, INCLUDING MANY\nYOUNG COUPLES AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MENTORING PROGRAM, THE\nNDGLC MENTORING NETWORK HAS THE CAPACITY TO REACH EXISTING RANCHERS, NEW AND START-UP\nRANCHERS, AND WOMEN/MINORITY RANCHERS DESIRING TO CONSERVE AND PROTECT NORTH DAKOTA'S NATURAL\nRESOURCES, INCLUDING WATER QUALITY. SUBSEQUENTLY BMPS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE TO SUPPORT\nNONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION MANAGEMENT EFFORTS.\n4) LIVESTOCK POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM - PHASE X: THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO DELIVER A\nSTATEWIDE PROGRAM THAT WILL REDUCE WATER QUALITY IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH\nCONCENTRATED LIVESTOCK FEEDING AREAS. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ASSISTING LIVESTOCK\nPRODUCERS TO DESIGN AND INSTALL MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. SOME OF THE PRACTICES TO\nBE INSTALLED INCLUDE DIVERSIONS, DIKES, FENCING, HOLDING PONDS, VEGETATIVE BUFFERS, AND\nSETTLING BASINS.\n5) STOCKMEN'S ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES PROGRAM - PHASE VIII: THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO DELIVER A STATEWIDE PROGRAM THAT WILL REDUCE WATER QUALITY IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CONCENTRATED LIVESTOCK FEEDING AREAS.
