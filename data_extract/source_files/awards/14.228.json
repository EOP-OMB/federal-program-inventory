THE RECOVERY HOUSING PROGRAM (RHP) ALLOWS STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO PROVIDE STABLE, TEMPORARY HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS IN RECOVERY FROM A SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDER. THE FUNDING COVERS A PERIOD OF NOT MORE THAN TWO YEARS OR UNTIL THE INDIVIDUAL SECURES PERMANENT HOUSING, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER. THE STATUTE PROVIDES THAT THE GRANT FUNDS SHALL BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT (CDBG) FUNDS UNDER TITLE I OF THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301 ET SEQ.). THE SUPPORT ACT AUTHORIZED HUD TO ESTABLISH A FUNDING FORMULA BASED ON SPECIFIC FACTORS LISTED IN SECTION 8071 OF THE SUPPORT ACT AND TO ALLOCATE FUNDS APPROPRIATED OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE FOR RHP ACCORDING TO THE ESTABLISHED FUNDING FORMULA. HUD PUBLISHED THE FUNDING FORMULA IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER ON APRIL 17, 2019 (84 FR 16027).; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THE USE OF RHP FUNDS IS LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES: \n\u2022 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND IMPROVEMENTS.

ENTITLEMENT COMMUNITIES DEVELOP THEIR OWN PROGRAMS AND FUNDING PRIORITIES.\n\nIN THE CDBG NON-ENTITLED COUNTIES IN HAWAII PROGRAM, THREE COUNTIES QUALIFY: HAWAII, KAUAI, AND MAUI. THE FY 2004 APPROPRIATIONS ACT REQUIRED THE GOVERNOR OF HAWAII TO DECIDE IF THE STATE WISHED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE CDBG PROGRAM BY JULY 31, 2004.

DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT MITIGATION (CDBG-MIT) GRANT FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS AND ALLOCATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (HUD) AS AUTHORIZED UNDER TITLE I OF THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF CDBG-DR FUNDS IS TO REBUILD DISASTER-IMPACTED AREAS AND PROVIDE CRUCIAL SEED MONEY TO START THE LONG-TERM RECOVERY PROCESS. THESE FLEXIBLE GRANTS HELP CITIES, COUNTIES, INDIAN TRIBES, AND STATES RECOVER FROM PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTERS, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-INCOME AREAS, SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS. SINCE CDBG-DR ASSISTANCE MAY FUND A BROAD RANGE OF RECOVERY ACTIVITIES, HUD CAN HELP COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT RECOVER DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE CDBG-DR AND CDBG-MIT FUNDS FROM HUD TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES RECOVERING FROM A PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTER. HUD ALLOCATES FUNDS BASED ON THE UNMET RECOVERY NEEDS OF EACH COMMUNITY. HUD ISSUES AN ALLOCATION ANNOUNCEMENT NOTICE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE LIST OF GRANTEES, ALLOCATIONS, AND ANY WAIVERS AND ALTERNATIVE REQUIREMENTS. GRANTEES MAY USE THE FUNDS FOR DISASTER RELATED LONG-TERM RECOVERY, RESTORATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE, HOUSING, ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION, AND MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. ALL CDBG-DR AND CDBG-MIT ACTIVITIES MUST CLEARLY ADDRESS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPACT OF THE DISASTER IN A PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED AREA FOR THE COVERED DISASTER. EACH GRANTEE MUST DEVELOP AN ACTION PLAN THAT OUTLINES HOW THE GRANTEE PLANS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING TO A COMBINATION OF RECOVERY PROGRAMS. EACH GRANTEE MUST MAKE THE DRAFT ACTION PLAN AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND FEEDBACK PRIOR TO SUBMITTING THE PLAN TO HUD FOR REVIEW. ONCE APPROVED, THE ACTION PLAN SERVES AS THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE GRANTEE\u2019S CDBG-DR PROGRAM. THE ACTION PLAN PROCESS IS OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE ALLOCATION ANNOUNCEMENT NOTICE.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: CDBG-DR FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN LONG-TERM DISASTER RECOVERY FOR COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTERS.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: CDBG-DR FUNDS ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PER STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. CDBG-DR IS THE ONLY FEDERAL DISASTER RESOURCE THAT PRIORITIZES LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME MEANS A FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD WITH AN ANNUAL INCOME LESS THAN THE SECTION 8 LOW INCOME LIMIT, WHICH IS GENERALLY 80 PERCENT OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. MOST ALLOCATIONS OF CDBG-DR AND CDBG-MIT FUNDS REQUIRE GRANTEES USE 70 PERCENT OF THE GRANT FUNDS TO BENEFIT LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME PERSONS, HOWEVER GRANTEES MUST REVIEW THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE GOVERNING THE FUNDS TO CONFIRM THE REQUIREMENTS OF EACH GRANT. OVERALL, CDBG-DR FUNDS SHOULD BE USED TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES, AND/OR BUSINESSES SITUATED IN THE MOST IMPACTED AND DISTRESSED AREAS AFFECTED BY A PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTER.;

RECOVERY (CDBG-DR) AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT MITIGATION (CDBG-MIT) GRANT FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS AND ALLOCATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (HUD) AS AUTHORIZED UNDER TITLE I OF THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF CDBG-DR FUNDS IS TO REBUILD DISASTER-IMPACTED AREAS AND PROVIDE CRUCIAL SEED MONEY TO START THE LONG-TERM RECOVERY PROCESS. THESE FLEXIBLE GRANTS HELP CITIES, COUNTIES, INDIAN TRIBES, AND STATES RECOVER FROM PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTERS, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-INCOME AREAS, SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS. SINCE CDBG-DR ASSISTANCE MAY FUND A BROAD RANGE OF RECOVERY ACTIVITIES, HUD CAN HELP COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT RECOVER DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES.; ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE CDBG-DR AND CDBG-MIT FUNDS FROM HUD TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES RECOVERING FROM A PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTER. HUD ALLOCATES FUNDS BASED ON THE UNMET RECOVERY NEEDS OF EACH COMMUNITY. HUD ISSUES AN ALLOCATION ANNOUNCEMENT NOTICE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE LIST OF GRANTEES, ALLOCATIONS, AND ANY WAIVERS AND ALTERNATIVE REQUIREMENTS. GRANTEES MAY USE THE FUNDS FOR DISASTER RELATED LONG-TERM RECOVERY, RESTORATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE, HOUSING, ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION, AND MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. ALL CDBG-DR AND CDBG-MIT ACTIVITIES MUST CLEARLY ADDRESS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPACT OF THE DISASTER IN A PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED AREA FOR THE COVERED DISASTER. EACH GRANTEE MUST DEVELOP AN ACTION PLAN THAT OUTLINES HOW THE GRANTEE PLANS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING TO A COMBINATION OF RECOVERY PROGRAMS. EACH GRANTEE MUST MAKE THE DRAFT ACTION PLAN AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND FEEDBACK PRIOR TO SUBMITTING THE PLAN TO HUD FOR REVIEW. ONCE APPROVED, THE ACTION PLAN SERVES AS THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE GRANTEE\u2019S CDBG-DR PROGRAM. THE ACTION PLAN PROCESS IS OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE ALLOCATION ANNOUNCEMENT NOTICE.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: CDBG-DR FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN LONG-TERM DISASTER RECOVERY FOR COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTERS.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: CDBG-DR FUNDS ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PER STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. CDBG-DR IS THE ONLY FEDERAL DISASTER RESOURCE THAT PRIORITIZES LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME MEANS A FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD WITH AN ANNUAL INCOME LESS THAN THE SECTION 8 LOW INCOME LIMIT, WHICH IS GENERALLY 80 PERCENT OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. MOST ALLOCATIONS OF CDBG-DR AND CDBG-MIT FUNDS REQUIRE GRANTEES USE 70 PERCENT OF THE GRANT FUNDS TO BENEFIT LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME PERSONS, HOWEVER GRANTEES MUST REVIEW THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE GOVERNING THE FUNDS TO CONFIRM THE REQUIREMENTS OF EACH GRANT. OVERALL, CDBG-DR FUNDS SHOULD BE USED TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES, AND/OR BUSINESSES SITUATED IN THE MOST IMPACTED AND DISTRESSED AREAS AFFECTED BY A PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTER.;
