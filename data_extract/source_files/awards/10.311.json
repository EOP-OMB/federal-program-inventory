BUT WE&#39;VE SEEN HUNDREDS BEGIN FARMING JUST TO QUIT AFTER A FEW YEARS. WHY? BEGINNING FARMERS REACH A POINT IN WHICH THEY NEED POINTED INVESTMENT TO SCALE THEIR BUSINESS. THEY EACH NEED PERSONALIZED, FOCUSED SERVICES TO TRANSFORM THEIR OPERATION FROM WEEKTO-WEEK SURVIVAL TO GENUINE SUSTAINABILITY AND SECURITY. THEY NEED INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE, PERSONALIZED EDUCATION TO DEVELOP A BUSINESS OR MARKETING PLAN, AND TRAINING TO ACCESS NEW MARKETS--NOT THE ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH THAT IS THE CURRENT NORM IN BEGINNING FARMER EDUCATION AND SUPPORT. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS CRITICAL SERVICE DOESN&#39;T EXIST. CURRENTLY, GEORGIA HAS PROGRAMS SUCH AS UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA EXTENSION JOURNEYMAN FARMER PROGRAM IN LAWRENCEVILLE AND CARROLLTON GEORGIA, TRULY LIVING WELL&#39;S URBAN GROWER TRAINING PROGRAM IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA, AND GLOBAL GROWER&#39;S TRAINING PROGRAM IN DECATUR, GEORGIA. THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED FOR ASPIRING GROWERS WITH LITTLE OR NO FARMING EXPERIENCE, OR IN THE CASE OF GLOBAL GROWERS, HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN THE UNITED STATES. ONCE GROWERS GRADUATE FROM THESE PROGRAMS AND BEGIN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES, SUPPORT SERVICES FALL OFF. WHEN A FARMER HAS A FEW YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND NEEDS ASSISTANCE TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL, THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO TURN. OUR FARMER ACCELERATOR PROGRAM FILLS THIS GAP. WE&#39;VE DESIGNED THIS PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT BEGINNING FARMERS RECEIVE EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO THRIVE. WE&#39;VE CREATED OUR ACCELERATOR PROGRAM BASED ON THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH SMALL TO MID-SCALE BEGINNING GROWERS AND LIMITED RESOURCE GROWERS--THROUGH OUR ANNUAL CONFERENCE ATTENDED BY HUNDREDS OF FARMERS, OUR EXPERIENCES WITH TWO BEGINNING FARMER RANCHER GRANTS, AN OAO GRANT, AND A 2018 LFPP GRANT THAT SERVES AS A PILOT FOR OUR ACCELERATOR MODEL. OUR ACCELERATOR WAS DEVELOPED WITH YEARS OF INTENSIVE INPUT FROM THE FARMERS ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE, WHO REPRESENT DIVERSE FARMERS IN TERMS OF RACE, GENDER, AND URBAN AND RURAL FARMERS.

THIS REGION CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST BIODIVERSE AND PRODUCTIVE FORESTLAND IN THE WORLD AND IS HOME TO A DIVERSITY OF CULTIVABLE FIELD AND FOREST CROPS (LOUCKS ET AL, 2016). YET IN SPITE OF THIS NATURAL RESOURCE ABUNDANCE, THE COUNTIES OF SOUTHEASTERN OHIO AND NORTHERN WEST VIRGINIA ARE AMONG THE POOREST IN THE REGION, MANY OF WHICH ARE USDA STRIKEFORCE COUNTIES. THE STRIKEFORCE COUNTIES IN OHIO (GUERNSEY, MORGAN, ATHENS, MEIGS, VINTON, PIKE, JACKSON, SCIOTO, ADAMS) AND WEST VIRGINIA (WIRT, RITCHIE, PLEASANTS, DODDRIDGE, TYLER, MASON) WILL BE THE GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL. HILLY TERRAIN, A LEGACY OF EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES, GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED POPULATIONS, AND A LACK OF FINANCIAL CAPITAL HELP TO TELL PART OF THIS REGION&#39;S PAST AND CHALLENGING FUTURE (APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION, 2010), AND CAN BE FURTHER UNDERSCORED BY NATIONAL TRENDS WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IN THE UNITED STATES BOTH FARM SIZE AND THE SCALE OF CROP PRODUCTION HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE SINCE THE 1980S, RESULTING IN FARMS THAT ARE INCREASINGLY CONSOLIDATED AND SPECIALIZED (MCDONALD ET AL., 2018). CONTRARY TO THESE NATIONAL TRENDS, THE NUMBER OF SMALL FARMS IN THE APPALACHIAN REGION HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THEIR SIZE AND DISBURSEMENT. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS SHIFT CAN BE SEEN IN MORGAN COUNTY WHERE THE NUMBER OF FARMS UNDER 10 ACRES HAS TRIPLED IN THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS (TO 22) WHILE THOSE WITH 10 - 50 ACRES HAVE DOUBLED (TO 134) IN THAT SAME PERIOD (USDA CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE, 2017). WITH RELATIVELY AFFORDABLE LAND, ACCESS TO BOTH METROPOLITAN AND MICROPOLITAN MARKETS, AND ACCESS TO DIRECT AND WHOLESALE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, THIS REGION PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BEGINNING FARMERS TO PROSPER.THE KEY TO SUCCESSFUL FARM BUSINESSES IN APPALACHIA IS INCOME DIVERSIFICATION THROUGH WHOLE FARM PLANNING. WHOLE FARM PLANNING IS A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO FARM MANAGEMENT THAT HELPS BEGINNING FARMERS INVENTORY THE NATURAL ASSETS AVAILABLE ON THEIR FARM, DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT GOALS BASED ON IDENTIFIED ASSETS, AND THEN IMPLEMENT PRODUCTION AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES (KLOETZLI ET AL., 2014). PROFITABLE BEGINNING FARMS IN THE REGION UTILIZE THEIR ON-FARM ASSETS TO DEVELOP MULTIPLE YEAR-ROUND INCOME STREAMS TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY, FARM RESILIENCY, AND REDUCE RISKS TO EXTERNAL FACTORS (CLIMATIC, MARKET-BASED, PANDEMIC, AND OTHERWISE). ASSET-BASED WHOLE FARM PLANNING ENABLES BEGINNING FARMERS TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE MULTIPLE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND INCOME STREAMS, THEN IMPLEMENT THOSE THAT ARE BEST SUITED TO THEIR FARM. REGIONALLY-SUITED AND DIVERSIFIED FARM BUSINESSES MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, SUCH AS SPECIALTY CROPS USING LEAN FARMING METHODOLOGY, GRASS-BASED LIVESTOCK, HIGH-VALUE NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS (NTFPS), CUSTOM MILLING AND FURNITURE, VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS, SPECIALTY MARKETING (E.G. CSAS), AND AGRITOURISM. WITHIN THESE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS THERE ARE MANY VALUABLE CROPS THAT ARE WELL SUITED TO THE FORESTS AND FARMS OF APPALACHIA, INCLUDING NATIVE BERRIES, FRUIT AND NUT TREES (PAWPAW, WALNUTS), MICROGREENS AND VEGETABLE CROPS, AND NUMEROUS SPECIALTY NTFPS, SUCH AS MAPLE SYRUP, GOURMET MUSHROOMS, AND MORE THAN 15 SPECIES OF HIGH-VALUE MEDICINAL HERBS. MANY OF THESE NTFPS REPRESENT NEW AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF INCOME FOR LOCAL FARMERS: WILD AND WILD-SIMULATED AMERICAN GINSENG SELLS FOR $600-$800/LB (PERSONS, 2018), RAMPS (A NATIVE PERENNIAL CULINARY HERB RELATED TO GARLIC) RETAILS FOR $10-$28/LB DEPENDING ON THE MARKET OUTLET, AND GOURMET LOG-GROWN SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS RETAIL FOR $10-$12/LB. (PRICES BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS, AND CURRENT BUYER AND SELLER COMMUNICATIONS). WHILE TIMBER IS OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS THE ONLY MEANS OF INCOME FROM APPALACHIAN FORESTS, NTFPS THAT GROW IN THE FOREST UNDERSTORY CAN PROVIDE FARMERS WITH A DIVERSIFIED INCOME STREAM TO SUPPLEMENT EARNINGS FROM FIELD-BASED CROPS AND LIVESTOCK, WHILE ALSO INCENTIVIZING FOREST RETENTION. AS THE MARKET DEMAND FOR NTFPS HAS GROWN, SO HAS FARMER INTEREST IN HOW TO INTEGRATE SPECIALTY FOREST CROPS INTO THEIR FARMING OPERATIONS. OUR REGION IS PARTICULARLY SUITED FOR THE INTEGRATION OF NTFPS IN WHOLE FARM PRODUCTION AS 40 - 60% OF ALL LAND IS FORESTED (APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION, 2014). SIMILARLY, SPECIALTY PRODUCTS LIKE GRASS-BASED LIVESTOCK, CUSTOM FURNITURE, AND OTHER ON-FARM INCOME STREAMS PRESENT PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES YEAR-ROUND FOR APPALACHIAN FARMERS. RETAIL PRICING FOR GRASS-FED MEAT ALONE IS TELLING: GRASS-FED BEEF RETAILS FOR TWICE THE AMOUNT ($7.26/LB, CARCASS WEIGHT) AS COMMODITY BEEF, PASTURED CHICKEN AVERAGES $5.87/LB, AND PASTURED PORK AVERAGES $4.77/LB (USDA AMS, 2019). CUSTOM FURNITURE HAS OPENED CHANNELS FOR MULTI-GENERATIONAL FARMING CRAFTSPERSONS TO REACH HIGH END URBAN MARKETS THROUGH MILLING AND FABRICATION OF PIECES FROM UN-MARKETABLE \"CHARACTER\" WOOD. OTHER OPPORTUNITIES LIKE AGRITOURISM PROVIDE OFF-SEASON INCOME STREAMS FOR FARMS. CURRENTLY LACKING IN APPALACHIAN OHIO AND WEST VIRGINIA IS A COORDINATED SUPPORT NETWORK TO HELP BEGINNING FARMERS START THEIR BUSINESS AND PURSUE DIVERSIFIED WHOLE FARM PRODUCTION.RURAL ACTION&#39;S PROPOSAL WHOLE FARM PLANNING, PEER LEARNING &AMP; INCOME DIVERSIFICATION FOR APPALACHIAN BEGINNING FARMERS IS TO ADDRESS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GAPS AMONG BEGINNING FARMERS IN SOUTHEAST OHIO AND NORTHERN WEST VIRGINIA. WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS BY RECRUITING BEGINNING FARMERS INTO A COORDINATED WHOLE FARMPLANNING NETWORK TO DEVELOP ACTIONABLE BUSINESS PLANS BASED ON THEIR GOALS AND ON-FARM ASSETS.PARTICIPANTS WILL BE BROUGHT INTO A SUPPORT NETWORK OF PEER BEGINNING FARMERS, AS WELL ASESTABLISHED FARMERS IN ORDER TO SET INDIVIDUAL GOALS AND DEVELOP THEIR WHOLE FARM PLANS. OVER ATHREE YEAR PERIOD THESE BEGINNING FARMERS WILL RECEIVE ONGOING AND RESPONSIVE TECHNICALASSISTANCE FROM THIS NETWORK OF PEER MENTORS, RURAL ACTION STAFF, AND REGIONAL EXPERTS FOCUSED ON FINANCIAL AND LEGAL GUIDANCE. THIS PROJECT STRUCTURE IS GUIDED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE SELF-IDENTIFIED NEEDS OF BEGINNING FARMERS. THESE STAKEHOLDERS ARE AT THE CORE OF RURAL ACTION&#39;S ASSET-BASED APPROACH TO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN THE AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY SECTORS. FARMERS ARE THE CATALYST FOR NEW RESOURCE DELIVERY IN OUR WORK, ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN PLANNING, AND ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF EDUCATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DELIVERY.

OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HISPANIC, VETERAN, AND LIMITED RESOURCE FARMERS AND RANCHERS THAT CAN SUCCESSFULLY ENTER AND SUSTAIN AGRIBUSINESS OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT AN IMPROVED REGIONAL FOOD PRODUCTION SYSTEM IN WESTERN COLORADO. SPECIFIC GOALS ARE TO: INCREASE # OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS SUCCESSFULLY ENGAGED IN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AND HOLISTIC AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN THE WESTERN COLORADO; ASSURE THAT SPECIAL-EMPHASIS AUDIENCES (VETERANS, HISPANICS, LIMITED RESOURCE AND SPECIALTY-CROP-FOCUSED PARTICIPANTS) ARE FAIRLY REPRESENTED IN AGRICULTURE PROFESSIONS IN OUR REGION; AND ASSURE THAT BEGINNING FARMERS/RANCHERS HAVE LONG-TERM ACCESS TO LAND, TRAINING, EDUCATION, MARKETS, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. CFRT MEETS THESE OBJECTIVES BY DELIVERING AN ACCESSIBLE, FARMER/RANCHER-DRIVEN, COHESIVE PROGRESSION OF BI-LINGUAL CORE COURSES, CONTINUING EDUCATION, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, AND ON-SITE EXPERIENCES THAT ADDRESS PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT TOPICS. COUPLED WITH IN-DEPTH MENTORSHIP AND LAND ACCESS SUPPORT, THE PROJECT IS GEARED SPECIFICALLY TO THE REGIONALLY-DRIVEN NEEDS OF OUR TARGET AUDIENCES.

ADDITIONAL COLLABORATORS INCLUDE MEMBERS OF OUR FARMER RANCHER ADVISORY TEAM AND VARIOUS OTHER STATE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.THE TARGET AUDIENCES OF THIS PROJECT ARE THE GROWING POOLS OF LATINOS, VETERANS, AND LIMITED RESOURCE AG-ENTREPRENEURS, EAGER TO ESTABLISH OR SUSTAIN SMALL, DIVERSIFIED FARMING/RANCHING OPERATIONS IN WESTERN COLORADO. WESTERN COLORADO REPRESENTS THE THIRD ZONE OF COLORADO&#39;S VAST AGRICULTURAL REGIONS, WITH MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS COMPRISING THE OTHER TWO. WITH WARM DAYS AND COOL NIGHTS (CREATED BY HIGH ALTITUDE), WE ARE RENOWNED FOR OLATHE SWEET CORN AND PALISADE PEACHES DUE TO THE CONCENTRATION OF SUGARS THAT OCCUR IN MANY CROPS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. WESTERN COLORADO COMPRISES NEARLY 40% OF COLORADO&#39;S AGRICULTURAL LAND, IN A STATE WHOSE CROP VALUES REACH $7.78 BILLION ANNUALLY.1 VETERANS AVERAGE 9.4% OF THE POPULATION, WITH SOME COUNTIES REPORTING 15.1%. NEARLY 6% OF VETERANS ARE UNEMPLOYED AND 21.6% HAVE A SERVICE-RELATED DISABILITY. OF VETERANS, 21.5% ARE HISPANIC,2 WHICH ALIGNS WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF HISPANICS IN COLORADO&#39;S OVERALL POPULATION.3 DESPITE THEIR PREVALENCE, HOWEVER, OUT OF COLORADO&#39;S 61,444 FARM OPERATIONS, ONLY 5% ARE OPERATED BYHISPANICS.4 WITH 28% OF COLORADO&#39;S HISPANICS AND 6.4% OF VETERANS LIVING IN POVERTY5, ALONG WITH A POPULATION OF LIMITED RESOURCE FARMERS WHO STATEWIDE AVERAGE LESS THAN $37,271 IN ANNUAL INCOME6, THE ECONOMIC, EMPLOYMENT, AND HEALTH DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY THESE GROUPS POINT TO THE NECESSITY FOR A PROGRAM TARGETED TOWARD THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS.WESTERN COLORADO&#39;S HIGH ALTITUDE, INTENSE SUNLIGHT, ALKALINE SOILS, DEPENDENCE ON SNOWFALL, COMPLEX WATER LAWS, DISTANCE FROM LARGE MARKETS, LACK OF DISTRIBUTION AND PROCESSING OPTIONS, SHORT SEASON, AND HIGH LAND PRICES CREATE DISTINCT ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FOR AGRICULTURE.

PRE AND POST-TEST SCORES FROM THE FMEP ONLINE FARM FUNDAMENTALS SHORT COURSE SHOW THAT PRODUCTION WAS NOT A PROBLEM FOR PARTICIPANTS. THE OVERALL SCORE FOR ALL TESTS WAS 73% WITH A 13% LEARNING LAG AND A 14% KNOWLEDGE GAIN (MSFAC-FMEP, 2020). HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO PLANNING FOR THE PRODUCTION SEASON, THEY GENERALLY DO NOT PLAN, BUT PURCHASE FARM INPUTS AS NEEDED, INCURRING HIGHER PRODUCTION COST THROUGHOUT THE SEASON. THE IMPACT OF PLANNING MITIGATES PRODUCTION ISSUES THAT CHALLENGE PRODUCERS IN CROP AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION AND FOREST MANAGEMENT. A SECOND CRITICAL BARRIER IS FINANCIAL PLANNING. APPROXIMATELY 90% OF FMEP PARTICIPANTSIN THE CURRENT GRANT ARE FARMING WITHOUT RECORDS OR FARM BUSINESS PLAN. WITHOUT VIABLE FINANCIAL RECORDS OR FARM BUSINESS PLAN, PRODUCERS MISS OUT ON TRACKING THEIR SPENDING, USING RECORDS TO MITIGATE FINANCIAL RISKS, MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL CREDIT, BUDGET FORECASTING, AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS. THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL PLANNING LEVERAGES ACCESS TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL THROUGH MSFAC SMALL FARM LOAN PROGRAM, GOVERNMENT LOANS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES. A THIRD CRITICAL BARRIER IS ACCESS TO MARKETS. IN THE CURRENT GRANT, THERE ARE PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE STARTED FARMING WITHOUT MARKET IDENTIFICATION. KNOWING HOW MUCH TO PRODUCE, WHAT TO PRODUCE AND WHAT FORM TO PRODUCE IS ESSENTIAL TO GAINING ACCESS TO MARKETS. DATA FROM THE FMEP SESSIONS ON THE MARKETING PLAN SHOW THAT 93% OF THE PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED KNOWLEDGE GAINS; 87% PLAN TO ADOPT AND/OR USE THE INFORMATION RECEIVED, AND 87% STATED THE INFORMATION MET THEIR NEEDS. THE IMPACT OF THE MARKETING PLAN HELPS PARTICIPANTS TO ATTRACT AND ENTER NEW MARKETS.THE FOURTH CRITICAL BARRIER IS INSTITUTING FOOD SAFETY PROTOCOLS. SMALL FARMERS MUST FOLLOW FOOD SAFETY GUIDELINES TO REDUCE FOODBORNE ILLNESS, WITH WELL DOCUMENTED RECORDS OF INSPECTIONS AND AUDITS. MOST NBFRV HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A FOOD SAFETY AUDIT, PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE OR NOT REQUIRED AT CERTAIN PRODUCTION LEVELS. THE U.S. CONGRESS ENACTED THE FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT (FSMA) WHICH ESTABLISHES STANDARDS FOR SAFE GROWING, HARVESTING, PACKING, AND HOLDING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES GROWN FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. THE GOAL IS TO PREVENT MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION AND REDUCE FOODBORNE ILLNESSES ASSOCIATED WITH FRESH PRODUCE. SINCE 2018 MSFAC HAS COLLABORATED WITH THE SOUTHERN CENTER AND THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE TO HOST FOUR PRODUCE SAFETY ALLIANCE GROWER TRAININGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE PRODUCE SAFETY ALLIANCE&#39;S (PSA) MISSION IS TO DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED NATIONAL PRODUCE SAFETY TRAINING PROGRAM TO PREPARE FRESH PRODUCE GROWERS TO MEET THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION&#39;S (FDA), FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT (FSMA) AND THE PRODUCE SAFETY RULE. ALTHOUGH MOST NBFRV WILL BE EXEMPT FROM FSMA, THE GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES (GAP) CERTIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF AFOOD SAFETY PLAN ARE GREAT MARKETING TOOLS.THE FINAL CRITICAL BARRIER IS KNOWLEDGE OF AVAILABLE USDA PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. MANY NBFRV ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE USDA PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR GET DISCOURAGED WHEN SEEKING ASSISTANCE. THE NBFRV WILL LINK PARTICIPANTS TO THEIR LOCAL USDA OFFICES. REPRESENTATIVES FROM VARIOUS USDA OFFICES WILL PRESENT THEIR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES DURING SCHEDULED ZOOM OR FACE-TO-FACE SESSIONS.

THIS PROJECT WILL RECRUIT, GROW AND SUPPORT THE NEXT GENERATION OF MINORITY FARMERS AND ASSIST THEM TO OVERCOME THE MANY CHALLENGES THEY FACE TO SUCCEED IN FARMING. MINORITY FARMERSHAVE MANY NEEDS THAT, IF FULFILLED, COULD HELP REDUCE SOME OF THEIR CHALLENGES. BECAUSE OF THE INTERRELATEDNESS OF THE CHALLENGES, THE KEY TO A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION LIES IN MENTORING AND A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO FARMER EDUCATION. SUCCESSFUL FARMING REQUIRES DIVERSE AND COMPLEX SKILLSETS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEST LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCED FARM MENTORS. FARMERS MUST CONSIDER BUSINESS PLANNING, FINDING LAND, SECURING FINANCING, MARKETING, PRODUCTION KNOWLEDGE, SECURING EQUIPMENT, DEVELOPING OR SECURING INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THEIR VISION FOR THEIRFARM, A PRODUCT OF THEIR VALUES, KNOWLEDGE, AND EXPERIENCE. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS OFFER THIS EXPERIENCE OF INTENSIVE MENTORSHIP TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF FARMERS. PASSING ON THIS KNOWLEDGE THROUGH FARM-BASED TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER, AS FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE ENTERING FARMING TODAY HAVE A RECENT FAMILY HISTORY OF WORKING IN AGRICULTURE. FURTHER, ACCESS TO INFORMATION IS KEY TO SUCCESSFUL FARMING AND TO COPING WITH DIFFICULT TIMES. MOST MINORITY PRODUCERS, UNFORTUNATELY, STRUGGLE TO FIND AND/OR USE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION. THEY EXPERIENCE THE FRUSTRATION OF NOT BEING ABLE TO LOCATE ANSWERS TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, AND NOT UNDERSTANDING THE INFORMATION. THE LACK OF BROADBAND IN RURAL ALABAMA HAS ISOLATEDMANY PRODUCERS AND EXCLUDED THEM FROM ESSENTIAL SERVICES, WITH MANY KEY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFORMATION.

THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE REQUESTED FUNDING IS ALLOCATED TO PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, 13% TO ASSISTING VETERANS, AND 86% TO SUPPORTING SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED BEGINNING FARMERS. A UNIQUE AND KEY FEATURE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ENHANCE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND VETERANS, FOCUS ON CHALLENGES THESE POPULATIONS FACE, AND HOW THESE CHALLENGES CAN BE AMELIORATED THROUGH THE RESOURCES AND TRAINING MADE AVAILABLE BY THE REQUESTED FUNDING.

THE END RESULT WAS A CURRICULUM THAT NOW INCLUDES, PER MODULE, A POWER POINT, A TRAIN THE TRAINER GUIDE, A LIST OF HMONG WORDS AND PHRASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TOPIC, A SERIES OF WORKSHEETS TO APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE AND SHORT QUIZ TO EVALUATE THE LEARNING;HAFA IS MEMBERSHIP-BASED, THUS WE HAVE A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH YEAR ROUND, ACTIVE, POST-TRAINING SUPPORT WITH IN-FIELD DEMONSTRATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS;LASTLY, OUR TRAINING CURRICULUM HAS A STRONG FOCUS ON FORMING COOPERATIVES TO GIVE SMALL FARMERS MORE TOOLS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL THROUGH COLLABORATIVE ACTION.IN HAFA&#39;S TRAINING APPROACH, WE BEGIN WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT IMMIGRANT FARMERS ALREADY KNOW, AND BUILD ON THAT KNOWLEDGE. THE LEARNING IS INTERACTIVE, CULTURALLY PRESENTED AND USES RELEVANT CASE STUDIES. FOCUSING ON INTERACTIONS AND ONE-TO-ONE TUTORIALS WE BELIEVE YIELDS A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF PARTICIPATION FROM MINORITY FARMERS, A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF COMPLETION FROM THOSE WHO DO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRAININGS, AS WELL AS A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF OVERALL SUCCESS AS MEASURED BY THE INCREASE IN FARM INCOME AND FAMILY WEALTH FOR TRAINING GRADUATES OVER THE LONG TERM.THE LONG TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO HELP YOUNGER AND BEGINNING HMONG FARMERS TO START FARMING AND STAY FARMING IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY INCREASING IMMIGRANT AND SECOND GENERATION FARMERS&#39; ABILITY TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL LIVING FROM FARMING WHILE RESPECTING TRADITIONAL METHODS OF LEARNING AND CULTURAL PRACTICES. BY WORKING SIMULTANEOUSLY ON BUILDING FINANCIALLY VIABLE FARMING OPERATIONS WHILE ALSO CONNECTING TO MULTI-CULTURAL HMONG IMMIGRANT FARMING COMMUNITIES, THE LONG TERM GOAL OF HMONG FARMERS STARTING AND STAYING IN FARMING CAN BE ACHIEVED.

THIS EQUATES TO THE PRESERVATION OF ABOUT 31.8% OF AVAILABLE AGRICULTURAL LANDS (THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION.)EASEMENT-BASED FARMLAND PRESERVATION PROGRAMS SEEK TO HELP MAKE FARMLAND MORE AFFORDABLE TO FARMERS BY REMOVING THE DEVELOPMENT VALUE FROM THE LAND; HOWEVER, EVEN DEED-RESTRICTED FARMLAND MAY BE EXPENSIVE FOR FARMERS IN MARKETS WHERE THERE IS COMPETITION FROM NON-FARMERS INTERESTED IN THE LAND FOR LIFESTYLE REASONS.FARMERS UNABLE TO PURCHASE LAND OFTEN TURN TO LEASING. SHORT-TERM LEASING (USUALLY 1 YEAR) IS THE NORM IN NEW JERSEY ON DEED-RESTRICTED FARMLAND, WHICH WORKS EXTREMELY WELL FOR COMMODITY CROPS. SHORT-TERM LEASES ARE PROBLEMATIC FOR FARMERS WHO WANT TO GROW HEALTHY FOOD TO FEED THEIR COMMUNITIES, SINCE IT INHIBITS INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENT IN SOIL HEALTH (CRITICAL ESPECIALLY FOR BEGINNING FARMERS/RANCHERS USING SUSTAINABLE/ORGANIC/REGENERATIVE METHODS TO PRODUCE FOOD).THE LONG-TERM GOAL THIS PROJECT, \"LAUNCHING BEGINNING FARMERS: LONG-TERM PRESERVED FARM LEASES AND FARM SUCCESS TRAINING\" IS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE BEGINNING FARMERS/RANCHERS&#39; ACCESS TO LONG-TERM LEASE AGREEMENTS ON PRESERVED FARMLAND.

THE REGION ALSO FREQUENTLY LANDS HIGH ON LISTS SUCH AS MARKET WATCH&#39;S \"BEST PLACES TO LIVE IN AMERICA.\" HOWEVER, THIS RAPID GROWTH HAS GENERATED TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES FOR AGRICULTURAL LAND ACCESS IN THE REGION.

THE PRICE OF IRRIGATION WATER HAS GROWN EVEN MORE QUICKLY, WITH A PROJECT PARTNER INDICATING THAT THEIR WATER SHARES HAVE DOUBLED IN PRICE SINCE 2018. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL ROOM FOR GROWTH IN THE LOCAL FOOD ECONOMY, WITH THE 2017 USDA NASS CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE INDICATING THAT ONLY 1.0% OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN LARIMER COUNTY WAS MARKETED LOCALLY. MANY COMPARABLE COUNTIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE LOCAL MARKETS THAT RANGE FROM 5% TO &GT;20% OF LOCAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.A KEY CHALLENGE TO GROWING THE LOCAL FOOD ECONOMY IN NORTHERN COLORADO IS RECRUITING AND RETAINING SKILLED FARMERS.

HOWEVER, AT THEIR NEXT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, WHEN THEY HAVE THE IDEAS, SKILLS, AND INITIATIVE TO CREATE THEIR OWN BUSINESS, THESE \"STARTUP FARMERS\" (BENSON ET AL. 2014) OFTEN LEAVE IN SEARCH OF MORE AFFORDABLE LAND AND WATER TO ESTABLISH THEIR BUSINESSES.

WHILE THIS CLEARLY BENEFITS INDIVIDUAL FARMERS, IT AFFECTS THE WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITIES IN OUR REGION AS WELL BY DEVELOPING A ROBUST LOCAL FOOD SYSTEM. THIS WILL IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC STABILITY OF OUR REGION WITH INCREASED JOBS, SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES, RETENTION OF LOCAL MONEY, AND INCREASED DIRECT MARKETS. IT WILL IMPROVE OUR ENVIRONMENT BY REDUCING TRANSPORT OF FOOD FROM OUTSIDE THE REGION, PRESERVING AGRICULTURAL LAND VULNERABLE TO DEVELOPMENT, AND MITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION WITH SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. IT WILL IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF RESIDENTS BY PROMOTING AND PROVIDING LOCAL, NUTRIENT DENSE, SEASONAL FRESH FOOD, AND IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A VIBRANT LIFESTYLE ROOTED IN LOCAL COMMUNITY WHICH IS COMPLIMENTARY TO THE ARTISTIC, CULTURAL, AND RECREATIONAL QUALITIES FOR WHICH THIS AREA IS WELL-KNOWN.

THESE TWO REGIONS IN SOME WAYS GREATLY DIFFER IN TERMS OF THEIR POPULATION OF NATIVE FARMERS.NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE SUSTAINABLY MANAGED AND CULTIVATED LAND UTILIZING TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. STRONG LINKS TO CULTURE, INDIGENOUS FARMING PRACTICES, AND STEWARDSHIP TRADITIONS, COUPLED WITH COMPLEX OWNERSHIP AND TRUST STATUS OF TRIBAL LANDS, MEAN THAT SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR NATIVE BFRS WILL BEST MEET THEIR NEEDS.TO DESIGN THIS PROJECT, FIRST NATIONS CONDUCTED A MARCH 2021 ONLINE SURVEY OF 31 NATIVE PRODUCERS REPRESENTING 19 TRIBES IN NRCS&#39; NORTH CENTRAL (16 PRODUCERS) AND WESTERN REGIONS (15 PRODUCERS). TWENTY-SEVEN PRODUCERS REPLIED (A RESPONSE RATE OF 87%). THIS PROJECT&#39;S ACTIVITIES RESPOND DIRECTLY TO OUR CONSTITUENTS&#39; RECOMMENDATIONS TO MEET THE FOLLOWING NEEDS FOR PRODUCERS: BUSINESS PLANNING; TRAINING (INCLUDING INDIGENOUS-TO-INDIGENOUS AND IN-PERSON) FOR NEW FARMERS; HELP TO GROW BUSINESS; SUPPORT FOR 1) MARKETING, 2) OUTREACH TO NEW OUTLETS, 3) DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS/NETWORKING, 4), BOOKKEEPING/TAX PREPARATION, AND 5) PLANNING. IN BASIC STRENGTHS (S), WEAKNESSES (W), OPPORTUNITIES (O), AND THREATS (T) ANALYSES (IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC), THE SURVEY IDENTIFIED: (S) PRODUCERS APPROXIMATELY EQUALLY SELL PRODUCTS INSIDE (78%) AND OUTSIDE (80%) THEIR OWN COMMUNITY; (W; DUE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC) FOOD PRODUCTION REDUCED DUE TO STAFFING SHORTAGES/CUTS, OR NOT ENOUGH WORKERS AVAILABLE TO HARVEST, OPERATIONS REDUCED DUE TO UNCERTAINTY OF MARKETS; AND REDUCED HOURS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY PROTOCOLS; (O) NEED TO MAINTAIN FOOD ACCESSIBILITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES, NEED FOR STRONG REGIONAL ECONOMIES AND HOME-GROWN FOODS, NEED FOR BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND FOOD SOVEREIGNTY SUSTAINED GROWN THROUGH FAMILY NETWORKS (NOT GOVERNMENT), REVIVAL OF INTEREST IN COMMUNITY GARDENING DUE TO FOOD SHORTAGES AND INTEREST IN SELF-RELIANCE, AND SMALL BUSINESSES/INDIVIDUAL PRODUCERS BEING OVERLOOKED; AND (T) SCHOOL AND RESTAURANT CLOSURE LIMITEDMARKETS AND PRICES, AND PRICES FOR CATTLE AND PRODUCE DROPPED (IN SOME CASES BY 50%).

IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF TOBACCO FARMS LOST THEIR PRODUCTION, WHICH CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO MULTIPLE FACTORS, SUCH AS A CHANGE IN QUOTA RULES AND FEDERAL PRICE-SUPPORT NO LONGER BEING AVAILABLE. HEMP, AS A NEW CROP FOR TN, OFFERS THE POTENTIAL TO REPLACE FARM PRODUCTION LOST IN TOBACCO SALES, PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO SOYBEAN, CORN MONO-CROPPING, AND PROVIDE SOIL IMPROVEMENTS AS A COVER CROP (TREY MALONE, 2019). HEMP IS ALSO BENEFICIAL TO POLLUTED SOILS AS IT PULLS THE TOXINS AND HEAVY METALS OUT OF THE SOIL (KHAN, 2015). IN RESPONSE TO THE 2014 FARM BILL, THE 108TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF TENNESSEE ENACTED PUBLIC CHARTER 916 (HOUSE BILL NO. 2445) ON 16TH APRIL 2014 REGARDING THE GROWING OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP IN TENNESSEE.

THE TEAM WILL ADOPT SEVERAL MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF BEGINNING SMALL FARMERS, VETERANS, AND SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS AND TO IDENTIFY VIABLE AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR BETTER SERVICE AND EFFECTIVE OUTREACH DELIVERY. AS A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO ASSIST FARMERS BY TRAINING, FOCUS GROUP MEETINGS, DEMONSTRATION OF TSU RESEARCH PLOTS, AND LOCAL SUCCESSFUL FARM VISITS AND CLASSROOM CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WILL BE PRIME TOOLS TO ENHANCE CONNECTIVITY AND EFFICACY OF THE PROJECT. ONE TO ONE CONSULTATION WILL ALSO ENHANCE TRUST AND RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE STAKEHOLDERS.THE PROJECT TEAM ALONG WITH THE ADVISORY PANEL, EXTENSION AGENTS, AND THE EXPERT GROUP WILL WORK ON MANY EDUCATIONAL AND EXTENSION OUTREACH PROGRAMS.

WE PROPOSE TO CREATE AN ADAPTABLE, SKILLS-BASED CURRICULUM THAT CAN BE USED ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO PREPARE AGRICULTURAL EDUCATORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BE LAND TRANSFER TRAINERS (LTTS) SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER SUPPORT BEGINNERS AND AGRICULTURAL LANDOWNERS AS THEY CONFRONT THE COMPLEX FINANCIAL, LEGAL AND INTERPERSONAL ISSUES RELATED TO LAND TRANSFER. FURTHER, WE SEEK TO GROW AN EVER-EXPANDING NETWORK OF SKILLED PROFESSIONALS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MEET GROWING DEMANDS TO FACILITATE FARM SUCCESSION AND ACCESS TO LAND. THIS APPROACH BUILDS ON AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST&#39;S (AFT) SUCCESSFUL 2015 BFRDP ET PROJECT, FARMLAND FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.AFT IS PROPOSING THIS WORK BECAUSE A SEISMIC TRANSITION OF LAND IS ON THE HORIZON. MORE THAN 40% OF AMERICAN FARMLAND--371 MILLION ACRES--IS OWNED BY SENIORS AGED 65 AND OLDER, BOTH SENIOR PRINCIPAL OPERATORS AND NONOPERATOR LANDLORDS. AT THE SAME TIME, ACCESS TO LAND IS A MAJOR BARRIER FOR YOUNG, BEGINNING, AND SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED (NEW GEN) FARMERS AND RANCHERS WHO WANT TO SUCCEED IN AGRICULTURE.THIS PROJECT IS BOTH URGENT AND TIMELY. THE RELEASE OF THE 2017 CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE IS A STARK REMINDER THAT THE STAKES OF TRANSFER ARE HIGH. WHILE ONLY 16% OF PRIMARY PRODUCERS ARE UNDER AGE 45, 38% ARE AGED 65 OR OLDER--WITH A 15% INCREASE OF RETIREMENT AGE PRODUCERS SINCE THE 2012 CENSUS. MORE THAN SIX TIMES AS MANY PRIMARY PRODUCERS ARE AGE 65 AND OLDER AS THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF 35. THIS IMBALANCE IS ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED WHEN COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL EMPLOYED WORKFORCE, WHERE MORE THAN 5 TIMES AS MANY WORKERS ARE UNDER 35 AS OVER 65.IT USED TO BE THAT LAND PASSED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION THROUGH CRADLE, ALTER, OR GRAVE. TODAY MOST FARMLAND IS ACQUIRED FROM A NON-RELATIVE. WHILE RESOURCES EXIST TO SUPPORT TRADITIONAL FARM SUCCESSION SITUATIONS, FEW ARE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS TRANSFER TO A NEW AND MORE DIVERSE GENERATION OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS--ESPECIALLY THOSE WHOSE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, VALUES AND GOALS DIFFER FROM CURRENT AGRICULTURAL LANDOWNERS.FAMILIES SPEND YEARS MANAGING THEIR FARMS AND RANCHES WITH THE HOPE OF KEEPING FUTURE GENERATIONS ON THE LAND. HOWEVER, MANY OPERATIONS ARE NOT PROFITABLE ENOUGH TO TRANSFER. IN OTHER CASES, HEIRS WANT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN--OR A DIFFERENT KIND OF OPERATION, OR DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE IN AGRICULTURE AT ALL. THESE ARE COMPLEX AND CHARGED ISSUES WHICH REQUIRE EMPATHY AND EMOTIONAL SENSITIVITY ALONG WITH TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE TO RESOLVE.NAVIGATING TRANSFER ISSUES WITH NONRELATIVES IS EQUALLY--IF NOT MORE--CHALLENGING. IT TAKES EXTRA SKILL TO BRIDGE CULTURAL, DEMOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCTION SYSTEM DIFFERENCES. AND IT TAKES EXTRA EFFORT TO CONNECT NEW GEN PRODUCERS WITH NONOPERATOR LANDOWNERS - INCLUDING WOMEN NONFARMING LANDLORDS (WNOLS), LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, LAND TRUSTS, CHURCHES, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS WHO HAVE SUITABLE LAND AND ARE WILLING TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO NEW GEN PRODUCERS. HOWEVER, A DEARTH OF RESOURCES IS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE FULL BREADTH AND DEPTH OF THESE ISSUES. IN SEARCHING FARM ANSWERS, WE DID NOT FIND CURRICULUM OR PROGRAMS THAT TAKE THIS KIND OF HOLISTIC, 21ST CENTURY APPROACH TO FARM TRANSFER.IT HAS BEEN WIDELY REPORTED THAT ACCESS TO LAND IS A PERVASIVE CHALLENGE FOR YOUNG AND BEGINNING FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IT IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR BEGINNERS TO ACQUIRE AFFORDABLE LAND WITH APPROPRIATE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE DUE TO FARM CONSOLIDATION, APPRECIATION OF LAND VALUES, CONVERSION OF FARMLAND TO DEVELOPMENT, AND A TIGHT SUPPLY OF LAND TO PURCHASE OR RENT. USDA ESTIMATED THAT ONLY 10% OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS WOULD CHANGE HANDS BETWEEN 2015 AND 2019, AND ONLY 2% TO A NONFAMILY MEMBER. WHETHER OR NOT NEW GEN PRODUCERS WILL INHERIT LAND, THEY NEED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO NEGOTIATE WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AND/OR NONRELATIVES TO ACHIEVE SECURE LAND TENURE.THESE ISSUES ARE AGGRAVATED BY THE FACT THAT NEW GEN PRODUCERS ARE MORE DIVERSE THAN PRIOR GENERATIONS AND MUCH MORE SO THAN AGRICULTURAL LANDOWNERS, 98 % OF WHOM ARE WHITE. FARM LABORERS ALSO ARE INCREASINGLY DIVERSE. AFRICAN AMERICAN, ASIAN AMERICAN, BLACK, NATIVE AMERICAN, HAWAIIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER, AND HISPANIC FARMERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TENANTS AND OWN LESS LAND, ALTHOUGH MANY WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT OPERATORS AND ARE QUALIFIED TO MANAGE THEIR OWN OPERATIONS. HEIRS&#39; PROPERTY AND FRACTIONATED PROPERTY RIGHTS FURTHER IMPEDE INHERITANCE ESPECIALLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN PRODUCERS. YET FEW FARM TRANSFER RESOURCES ADDRESS THESE THORNY ISSUES.AT THE SAME TIME, THE TYPES OF AGRICULTURAL LANDOWNERS ALSO ARE INCREASINGLY VARIED--FROM INDIVIDUALS TO INSTITUTIONS. INSTITUTIONAL LANDOWNERS OFTEN HAVE AVAILABLE FARMLAND BUT DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIND OR NEGOTIATE SUITABLE ARRANGEMENTS WITH QUALIFIED NEW GEN PRODUCERS. IN ADDITION, 544,000 WNOLS PLAY AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN FARM TRANSFER. THEY OWN ABOUT 25% OF THE 354 MILLION ACRES RENTED OUT FOR FARMING AND ARE ESPECIALLY COMMITTED TO FARM FAMILIES AND FARM COMMUNITIES. EVEN FEWER RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO ENGAGE AND SUPPORT NONOPERATING LANDOWNERS TO TRANSITION THEIR LAND TO NEW GEN PRODUCERS. FARMANSWERS.ORG DOES PROVIDE VALUABLE FARM TRANSFER RESOURCES, YET NONE REALLY ADDRESS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE NEW GEN DEMOGRAPHICS AND MULTIPLE TYPES OF AGRICULTURAL LANDOWNERS. PROGRAMS INCLUDE LAND FOR GOOD&#39;S FARM LEGACY PROGRAM, NATIONAL YOUNG FARMERS COALITION&#39;S (NYFC) FINDING FARMLAND COURSE, CALIFORNIA FARM LINK&#39;S FARM SUCCESSION GUIDEBOOK AND RENEWING THE COUNTRYSIDE&#39; S FARMLAND ACCESS HUB. FURTHER, ASIDE FROM AFT&#39;S PRIOR BFRDP WORK AND NYFC&#39;S FINDING FARMLAND, THESE PROGRAMS ARE REGIONALLY BASED IN AREAS WITH ROBUST FARMER SERVICES, LEAVING MUCH OF THE COUNTRY WITHOUT LOCAL EXPERTISE.AFT IS FILLING THIS VOID. THROUGH THIS EDUCATIONALTEAM PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO: 1. EVALUATE EXISTING CURRICULA, PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES RELATED TO LAND TRANSFER; 2. DEVELOP CURRICULUM AND MATERIALS TO FILL GAPS; 3. PREPARE A COHORT OF LAND TRANSFER TRAINERS TO TRAIN NEW GEN PRODUCERS, LANDOWNERS AND OTHER TRAINER; AND 4. EXPAND AND CONTINUE TO SERVE A NETWORK OF LAND TRANSFER PROFESSIONALS, NEW GEN PRODUCERS AND LANDOWNERS THROUGH THE AFT&#39;S FARMLAND INFORMATION CENTER AND BFRDP CURRICULUM AND TRAINING CLEARINGHOUSE.OUR PRIMARY TARGET AUDIENCES ARE AGRICULTURAL EDUCATORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, NEW GEN FARMERS AND RANCHERS, AND AGRICULTURAL LANDOWNERS WHO ARE READY TO TRANSFER LAND, INCLUDING SENIOR PRODUCERS AND NONFARMING LANDOWNERS.

THE CHALLENGES INCLUDE USE OF LOW-QUALITY VARIETIES, REDUCED FRUIT POLLINATION, AND REDUCED ACCESS TO MARKETS. GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES (GAPS) TRAINING AND PEST MANAGEMENT AND PESTICIDESAFETY IS NEEDED BY THESE FARMERS. LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND NEED FOR STRONGER BUSINESS AND MARKETING SKILLS ARE ALSO MAJOR HURDLES. LATINO FARMERS ARE HARDWORKING AND DRIVEN TO SUCCEED. THEY ARE ALSO A RISING COMPONENT OF MICHIGAN&#39;S AGRICULTURE SECTOR. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT BEGINNING LATINO FARMERS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS AND TRAINING TO OVERCOME ADVERSE CONDITIONS TO SUPPORT CROP PRODUCTION, BUSINESS DEALINGS, AND MARKETING, AND THEREBY POSITIVELY IMPACT THE ECONOMY OF MICHIGAN AND THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS PROJECT \"LA COSECHA (THE HARVEST) 2020\" AIMS TO ASSIST AND PROVIDE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TOOLS TO SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED BEGINNING LATINO FARMERS INCLUDING YOUNGER GENERATIONS (30 AND UNDER); FARM WORKERS (\"JORNALEROS\"), AND LATINOS FROM NON-FARMING BACKGROUNDS THAT ARE TRANSITIONING TO BECOME BEGINNING FARMERS. THIS PROJECT WILL BE LED BY MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY (ENTOMOLOGY, MIGRANT STUDENT SERVICES (MSS) AND MSU EXTENSION) IN COLLABORATION WITH TELAMON CORPORATION, A NGO WITH STRONG EXPERTISE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION TRAINING AND OUTREACH FOR NEW FARMERS. OUR TARGET IS TO INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION OF LATINOS IN THIS GROUP (KINSHIPS, LOS PARIENTES) IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE WILL ENHANCE THEIR SUSTAINABILITY AND PROMOTE THE FARMING LIVELIHOOD WHICH CARRIES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. OUR TARGET AUDIENCE ARE LATINOS SMALL FARMERS IN SOUTHWEST MICHIGAN.THE OBJECTIVES OF LA COSECHA (THE HARVEST) 2020 ARE: A) INCREASE FRUIT AND CROP PRODUCTION AND DIVERSIFICATION; B) PROVIDE THE TRAINING IN BUSINESS, MARKETING AND ACCESS TO THE FOOD SYSTEMS (HUBS); D) TRAIN IN SAFETY PRACTICES INCLUDING (GAPS) AND PESTICIDE EDUCATION; E) ACCESS TO THE USDA PROGRAMS; AND F) PROVIDE ESSENTIAL TRAINING IN PACKAGING. OUR PREDICTION IS THAT LATINO FARMERS WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE RIGHT DECISIONS ABOUT CROP PRODUCTION AND IMPROVE BOTH SUSTAINABILITY AND FOOD SAFETY.

THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP NEW FARMERS THROUGH 1) A CERTIFICATE-BASED FARMER TRAINING PROGRAM THAT INTEGRATES FORMAL CLASSROOM AND EXPERIENTIAL LESSONS, 2) 1-ON-1 BUSINESS CONSULTING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT, AND 3) ONGOING PRODUCTION, BUSINESS, AND NETWORKING SUPPORT. INCORPORATING THESE COMPONENTS WILL INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS FOR THE STATE&#39;S NEW AND BEGINNING FARMERS.LOCATED 2,200 MILES FROM THE CONTINENTAL U.S., HAWAII IMPORTS ABOUT 85-90% OF ITS FOOD, MAKING IT PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO DISRUPTIONS IN FOOD SUPPLY. THE STATE STRUGGLES WITH AN AGING FARMER POPULATION (AVG. 60 YEARS OLD), LACK OF FARM LABOR, AND DECLINING NUMBERS OF SUSTAINABLE FARMERS (THE NET INCOME FOR FARMS IS DOWN 25% SINCE THE LAST USDA-NASS CENSUS). TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES, HAWAII&#39;S GOVERNOR ESTABLISHED A GOAL TO DOUBLE LOCAL FOOD PRODUCTION BY 2030.OF THE 7,328 FARMS IN HAWAII, 78% EARN LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR. WITH HIGH COSTS FOR LAND, LABOR, AND INPUTS, FOR THE MAJORITY OF FARMERS, THIS LEVEL OF SALES IS INSUFFICIENT TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOUSEHOLD INCOME. FURTHERMORE, 71% OF THE PRINCIPAL FARM OPERATORS ARE AT LEAST 55 YEARS OLD.IN ORDER TO INCREASE FOOD PRODUCTION AND PREPARE THE NEXT GENERATION OF FARMERS, SUPPORT IS NEEDED TO DEVELOP FINANCIALLY VIABLE FARMING OPERATIONS. NEW FARMERS FOCUSED ON COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION MUST BE DEVELOPED AND EXISTING FARMS MUST INCREASE YIELD AND PROFITABILITY.

THE PROGRAM PREPARES STUDENTS FOR CAREERS IN AGRICULTURE, ALLOWING MANY TO START INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES, IMPROVE BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY WHILE BUILDING CAPITAL AND EXPERIENCE TO START A BUSINESS.SINCE GFH&#39;S PREVIOUS BFRDP GRANT, EXPANDED PHASES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO TWO SITE LOCATIONS. THE CURRICULUM HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED THROUGH THE ADDITION OF WHOLESALE CROP PRODUCTION LESSONS, HANDS-ON BUSINESS EXERCISES AND FIELD TRIPS, AND A MODIFIED BUSINESS PLAN ASSIGNMENT TO FOSTER DEEPER LEARNING. COLLABORATIONS HAVE LED TO MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPANTS. IN 2018, KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS RAN A CONTEST EXCLUSIVELY FOR GFH GRADUATES THAT PROVIDED ACCESS TO FREE LAND FOR 3 YEARS AND PRIZE MONEY OF $10,000 TO SCALE THEIR BUSINESS.

STANDARD RENEWAL FUNDING WILL INCREASE ABFFC&#39;S IMPACT AND INTEGRATE EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL FOREST FARMER PROGRAMS WITHIN THE NAC-SPONSORED AFFC ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE (ABFFC &RARR; INFORMS &RARR; AFFC).FOREST FARMING IS AN AGROFORESTRY PRACTICE THAT CULTIVATES HERBAL, EDIBLE, DECORATIVE, AND HANDICRAFT NTFPS UNDER A FOREST CANOPY THAT IS MODIFIED OR MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE SHADE LEVELS AND HABITAT THAT FAVOR GROWTH AND ENHANCE PRODUCTION (CHAMBERLAIN ET AL. 2009). NTFPS ARE THE PLANTS, PARTS OF PLANTS, FUNGI, AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL THAT ARE HARVESTED FROM NATURAL, MANIPULATED, OR DISTURBED FORESTS AND USED FOR COMMERCIAL OR PERSONAL PURPOSES. INSTEAD OF WILD HARVESTING, FOREST FARMERS INTENTIONALLY CULTIVATE MARKETABLE NTFPS IN THEIR NATIVE WOODED HABITAT USING THREE FORMS OF PRODUCTION - WOODS GROWN, WILD SIMULATED, AND MANAGED WILD POPULATIONS (MUNSELL ET AL. 2013). WOODS GROWN FOREST FARMING RESEMBLES GARDENING AND REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT INPUTS AND TIME. WILD SIMULATED IS LESS-INTENSIVE CULTIVATION IN A LARGELY UNDISTURBED NATURAL GROWING ENVIRONMENT. MANAGED WILD POPULATIONS IS TENDING AND PROPAGATING EXISTING STANDS OF NATURALLY GROWING NTFPS. THESE TECHNIQUES ALLOW FARMERS TO PRODUCE AND SELL RAW MATERIAL THAT IS TRACEABLE, UNADULTERATED, AND SUSTAINABLE. THIS LEADS TO PRICE-PREMIUMS BECAUSE COMPANIES CAN TRACE AND CONFIDENTLY SELL VERIFIED PRODUCTS TO DISCRIMINATING CONSUMERS.MARKETS FOR NTFPS CONTINUE TO GROW. FOR INSTANCE, HERBAL SUPPLEMENT MARKETS THAT DEPEND ON NTFPS CURRENTLY EXCEEDS ONE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND IS RISING (VAUGHAN ET AL. 2013). \"THE TOTAL SALES OF HERBAL DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES INCREASED BY 7.7% IN 2016 - THE SECOND HIGHEST RATE OF PRODUCT GROWTH IN MORE THAN A DECADE. CONSUMERS SPENT AN ESTIMATED $7.45 BILLION ON HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS IN 2016, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $530 MILLION FROM 2013. THIS MARKS THE 13TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF GROWTH FOR HERBAL SUPPLEMENT SALES AND THE FIRST TIME THAT TOTAL U.S. RETAIL SALES SURPASSED $7 BILLION\" (SMITH ET AL. 2017). INTEREST IN EDIBLE FOREST PRODUCTS ALSO IS MOUNTING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE US RAMPS (ALLIUM TRICOCCUM) MARKET NOW EXCEEDS 500,000 POUNDS TRADED ANNUALLY AND PLANTS RETAIL FOR AS HIGH $28 PER FRESH POUND. FOREST FARMED LOG-GROWN MUSHROOM HAVE LONG BEEN POPULAR AND IN RECENT YEARS FOREST FARMERS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE GROWTH IN DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER MARKETS AND LOCAL AGGREGATOR DEMAND BY SELLING DIVERSIFIED PRODUCTS FOR UPWARDS OF $15 PER POUND.

NORTH CAROLINA CERTAINLY NEEDS TO ADD NEW FARM ENTREPRENEURS TO REPLACE THOSE RETIRING TO KEEP UP WITH THE GROWING FOOD DEMANDS OF A RISING POPULATION GLOBALLY. ANOTHER MAJOR PLAYER IN NC&#39;S ECONOMY IS THE MILITARY WITH A, \"SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE STATE&#39;S ECONOMY.\" (LEVY, 2015) AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY ESTIMATES THAT MORE THAN 666,000 MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS CALL NORTH CAROLINA HOME (TIPPETT, 2018). ONE AVENUE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF AGRICULTURE IS TO ASSIST, EDUCATE, MENTOR, AND TRAIN EXITING MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS WHERE IT IS MOST EFFECTIVE TO DOSO. FORT BRAGG, NC IS THE LARGEST POPULATED US ARMY BASE, SERVING 238,646 ACTIVE DUTY AND RESERVE SOLDIERS AND VETERANS, CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES, AND FAMILY MEMBERS WITHIN THE LOCAL AREA (MILITARYBASES.US, 2019).THE U.S. IS FACING CHALLENGES IN THE AREAS OF FOOD SECURITY AND FOOD DIVERSITY, AND MILITARY VETERANS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY INTERESTED IN AGRICULTURAL OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO THE NATURE OF AGRICULTURAL WORK. THE USDA IS SEEKING VETERANS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF RETIRING FARMERS. THE VETERAN COMMUNITY IS WELL SUITED TO BECOME FARMERS BECAUSE THEYNOT ONLY HAVE A STRONG WORK ETHIC AND TENACITY NEEDED TO FARM, BUTMANY OF THEM HAVE THE INCOME WITH RETIREMENTS AND DISABILITY PAYMENTS THAT WILL GIVE THEM AN EDGE IN BUILDING A FARM WITHOUT AN OFF-FARM JOB.THE CORRELATION BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE MILITARY IS REGARDED AS A \"DEEP HISTORICAL HERITAGE\" (BESTERMAN-DHAH, CHAVEZ, BENDIXSEN, &AMP; ASPILLAGA, 2015) AND MOST OF OUR MILITARY FIGHTING FORCES FROM WORLD WAR II AND BEFORE WERECOMPRISED OF MEN THAT CAME FROM FARMS (ELLIOTT, 2017). IN A RECENT STUDY, (KYLE 2018) FOUND THAT AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS NEED TO BE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED WITH MILITARY SYMBOLISM TO EASE VETERANS AND PARTICIPATION IS HIGHER WHEN A VETERAN RUNS THE PROGRAM. IN REGARD TO VETERAN TRANSITION ISSUES, MOORE (1998) CLAIMS SITUATED PARTICIPATION OR HANDS-ON TRAINING (SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE MILITARY) REDUCES NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF TRANSITION OUT OF THE MILITARY AND INTO A NEW CAREER.THUS, THE VETERANS AGRICULTURAL TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM (VATEP) PROGRAM WILL SERVE AS A CONDUIT FOR VETERANS ENTERING THE AGRICULTURAL WORLD. THIS PROGRAM IS EXCLUSIVELY DESIGNED FOR VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND RUN BY VETERANS WHO HAVE HAD PRIOR, SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE INSTITUTING PROGRAMS AND FARMS.FROM PROGRAMS CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE, DATA WERE GATHERED FROM THE INTERESTED MILITARY COMMUNITY. 250 NC VETERANS WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE INPUT, AND 103 PROVIDED ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION OF, \"WHAT TOPICS ARE YOU WISHING TO LEARN ABOUT SHOULD A TRAINING PROGRAM EXIST AROUND THE MULTIPLE FACETS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION?\" 10 TOPICS WERE PRESENTED AS A POLL FORMAT AND 82% OF ALL RESPONSES CHOSE THE FOLLOWING TOPICS LISTED IN ORDER OF HIGHEST CHOICES FIRST: 1.

HONEY PRODUCTION IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO BEEKEEPING FARMERS FROM LARGE TO SMALL SCALE AND HOBBYISTS OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, BEEKEEPING FARMERS HAVE REPORTED CONSISTENT LOSSES (30-70%) OF HONEY BEE COLONIES OVER THE LAST DECADE. THESE HIGH LOSSES RESULT IN IMMENSE ECONOMIC BURDENS THAT HAVE PUT MANY BEEKEEPING FARMERS OUT OF BUSINESS AND HAVE PREVENTED NEW BEEKEEPING FARMERS FROM SUCCESSFULLY GROWING THEIR OPERATIONS. THUS, THE DECLINE IN BEE HEALTH AND THE BEEKEEPING INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SERIOUS GLOBAL THREAT TO FOOD SECURITY, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, AND TRADE. COMMON FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO HONEY BEE COLONY LOSS, INCLUDE PESTICIDE EXPOSURE, PESTS, PATHOGENS, AND POOR NUTRITION. HOWEVER, AN UNDERLINING ISSUE LESS ADDRESSED HAS BEEN IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF BEES AND BEE PESTS. ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN GROWING ENTHUSIASM FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO BEGIN BEEKEEPING, WITHOUT TRAINING AND GUIDANCE MANY WHO START A HIVE QUICKLY LOSE INTEREST AND MOTIVATION WHEN THEIR COLONIES FAIL. IN FACT, FROM 2008-2017 THE AVERAGE WINTER LOSSES REPORTED BY BEGINNING SMALL SCALE OR \"BACKYARD\" BEEKEEPING FARMERS (MANAGING FEWER THAN 50 COLONIES) WAS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER (40%) THAN SIDELINER (MANAGING 51-500 COLONIES), AND COMMERCIAL (MANAGING 500+ COLONIES) OPERATIONS ACROSS THE U.S. (34 AND 28%, RESPECTIVELY). THIS TREND HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT MANY BEGINNING BEEKEEPING FARMERS WHO DO NOT HAVE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FIND ADVICE THROUGH INTERNET SOURCES, BLOGS, AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS. TYPICALLY THESE SOURCES ARE FROM OTHER BEEKEEPERS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAD FORMAL TRAINING. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE OFTEN NOT SCIENCE-BASED AND CAN HAVE MORE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON THE COLONIES IF FOLLOWED. THE LONG TERM GOAL OF THIS REGIONAL BEEKEEPING TRAINING PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE SCIENCE-BASED TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO BEEKEEPING FARMERS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OF HONEY BEES AND THUS SUSTAIN AND PROMOTE NEW BEEKEEPING FARMER BUSINESSES. THE PROGRAM WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL THROUGH 3 OBJECTIVES: 1) PROVIDE TRAINING FOR BEGINNING BEEKEEPING FARMERS WITH 0-10 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT BEE BIOLOGY, ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS, CONSERVATION PRACTICES TO PROMOTE MORE POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY LANDSCAPES, AND PROVIDE TOOLS THAT SUPPORT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT; 2) DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL MODULES AND MATERIALS TO MAKE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES MORE ACCESSIBLE. EDUCATIONAL AIDS WILL BE AMENDED AND UPDATED THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WHERE FEEDBACK IS OBTAINED BY A COMMITTEE OF REPRESENTATIVE BEEKEEPING FARMERS AND BEEKEEPING INSTRUCTORS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS (INCLUDING KNOWLEDGE GAPS, EMERGING PEST ISSUES, AND MISINFORMATION) THEN EXISTING BUT OUTDATED EDUCATIONAL MODULES AND MATERIALS WILL BE AMENDED TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS WHICHWILL THEN BE DISTRIBUTED BACK TO BEEKEEPING INSTRUCTORS; AND 3) PROVIDE TARGETED TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS, SUCH AS LATINOS, TRANSITIONING MILITARY AND VETERANS, WOMEN AND TRIBAL GROUPS. BY OFFERING CULTURALLY-SENSITIVE EXPLORATORY BEEKEEPING CLASSES AND FOLLOWING UP AFTER WITH SUPPORT IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WILL RECEIVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO BECOME BEEKEEPING FARMERS.ALTHOUGH OTHER TRAINING PROGRAMS EXIST, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OFFERED AT A MULTI-STATE REGIONAL SCALE. ADDITIONALLY, ANOTHER ASPECT THAT IS UNIQUE FROM OTHER PROGRAMS IS THAT WE INCLUDE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND BASIC BIOLOGY KNOWLEDGE.
