EFFORTS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ACTORS TO ADDRESS THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THESE FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT YET BEEN MET WITH A COMPLEMENTARY EFFORT BY THE NW CLIMATE ADAPTATION SCIENCE AND ASSESSMENT COMMUNITY, LEADING TO RESEARCH THAT REINFORCES POWER DYNAMICS AND STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES AND FAILS TO ADDRESS CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAPS AROUND COMMUNITY-SCALE CLIMATE IMPACTS.\n\nWE PROPOSE A PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES ON\nTHE FRONTLINES OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN PURSUING THEIR OWN RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES WHILE ENSURING THAT\nLOCAL AND PLACE-BASED INNOVATIONS AND NEEDS ARE SCALED OUT AND UP TO ADVANCE RESILIENCE MORE\nBROADLY. OUR CENTRAL RESEARCH QUESTION   HOW CAN SCIENCE-BASED EVIDENCE ASSIST FRONTLINE\nCOMMUNITIES IN IMPROVING THEIR RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, WHILE ADDRESSING THE LEGACY OF\nSYSTEMIC INEQUITY THAT CONTINUES TO INFLUENCE THEIR LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS?

FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES ARE CENTERED IN THIS EFFORT: THEY PARTICIPATE ON THE\nLEADERSHIP TEAM, HELP SHAPE AND IMPLEMENT THE RESEARCH AGENDA AND CONNECT OUR WORK WITH\nCOMMUNITY-BASED RESILIENCE EFFORTS ACROSS THE NATION.\n\nWE PROPOSE THREE PORTFOLIOS OF WORK. THE TRIBAL COASTAL RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO AND THE RURAL RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO FOCUS ON KEY TYPES OF COMMUNITIES FACING DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE NORTHWEST. THE WORK WILL INVOLVE INTEGRATED NATURAL AND SOCIAL RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND COMMUNITY NEEDS, PRIORITIES, VALUES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCELERATING ADAPTATION, AND DEEP COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO ENHANCE LOCAL ADAPTIVE CAPACITY THROUGH APPLICATION OF THIS KNOWLEDGE. THE SCALING RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO ACCELERATE CLIMATE ADAPTATION IN THE NORTHWEST, ACROSS THE RISA NETWORK AND IN STATE AND FEDERAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. ONGOING EVALUATION OF RELATIONSHIPS, PROCESSES AND OUTCOMES WILL ENABLE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PROJECTS AND ADVANCE THE SCIENCE OF EVALUATION AND PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH ON RESILIENCE. \n\nTHE PROPOSED WORK DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THREE NOAA NEXT-GENERATION STRATEGIC GOALS: INCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF COASTAL TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMIES, CONTRIBUTE TO WEATHER-READY ECONOMIES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND ADVANCE ADAPTIVE CAPACITY IN FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES.
