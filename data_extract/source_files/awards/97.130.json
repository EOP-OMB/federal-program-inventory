THE RESEARCH WILL COMBINE TARGETED DISSOLUTION OF RADIONUCLIDES FROM DEBRIS WITH RAPID MICROFLUIDIC SEPARATIONS TO PRODUCE SAMPLES WITH QUALITY SIGNATURES WITHIN 24 HOURS OF A POST-DETONATION EVENT. EXPERIENCED FACULTY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS RADIOCHEMISTRY PROGRAM HAVE PARTNERED WITH EXPERTS FROM THE NUCLEAR AND RADIOCHEMISTRY GROUP AT LLNL TO JOINTLY MENTOR STUDENTS IN RADIOCHEMISTRY WHO WILL PERFORM INNOVATIVE RESEARCH RELEVANT TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF NUCLEAR FORENSICS CAPABILITIES. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO EDUCATE AMBITIOUS AND DIVERSE STUDENT-SCIENTISTS IN THE AREA OF NUCLEAR FORENSICS WHILE SOLVING TECHNICAL CHALLENGES FACED BY DHS IN THE COUNTERING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (CWMD) OFFICE ARENA. WITHIN CWMD, THE NATIONAL TECHNICAL NUCLEAR FORENSICS CENTER (NTNF) HAS A MISSION TO GUARANTEE A BROAD AND ACTIVE NUCLEAR FORENSICS CAPABILITY. THIS MISSION INCLUDES DEVELOPMENT OF THE APPROPRIATE NUCLEAR FORENSIC EXPERTISE FOR THE UNITED STATES. THIS PROJECT ADDRESS BOTH THIS OBJECTIVES BY DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF NUCLEAR FORENSIC SCIENTISTS AND ADVANCING RAPID SIGNATURE ANALYSIS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NV", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "030ff4e1-5b82-35d0-a78c-551a23bb4ba1-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_23CWDNFE00005_7062"}, {"internal_id": 158863411, "Award ID": "23CWDNFE00004", "Award Amount": 1395000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-05-01", "CFDA Number": "97.130", "Description": "THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A SUITE OF ATOMISTIC AND MESOSCALE COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS AUGMENTED WITH EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION TO PREDICT FORWARD AND INVERSE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PHYSICAL CHEMICAL MATERIAL PRODUCTION PROCESSES AND MEASURABLE MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS. SPECIFICALLY, CHARACTERIZATION AND MODELING METHODS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO STUDY THE PHASE CHANGES (INCLUDING CHEMICAL CHANGES) IN ACTINIDE ALLOYS DUE TO OXIDATION AND HYDRIDING AS WELL AS RADIATION DAMAGE. THESE WILL THEN BE APPLIED TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT AND PROCESSING ON ACTINIDE ALLOYS THAT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO THE NUCLEAR FORENSICS PROGRAM. A KEY FOCUS WILL BE ON PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS IN ACTINIDE ALLOYS DURING CORROSION (OXIDATION, HYDRIDING) AND IRRADIATION (SEGREGATION AND PRECIPITATION). SUCH TRANSFORMATIONS MAY PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE FORENSICS ANALYST ON NATURE OF STORAGE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS AGE OF INTERDICTED SAMPLE. THUS THIS PROJECT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES TWO TECHNICAL MISSION AREAS: TMA 1: PRE-DETONATION MATERIAL AND DEVICE SIGNATURES AS WELL AS TMA 2: PRE-DETONATION ANALYSIS METHODS AND TOOLS. TWO GRADUATE STUDENT FELLOWS AND TWO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BE TRAINED IN CHARACTERIZATION AND SIMULATION METHODS AND WILL SPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME INTERACTING WITH NATIONAL LABORATORY SCIENTISTS ON THESE TOPICS. THE PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE A LONG-STANDING- PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PIS AT GEORGIA TECH AND SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES THAT HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH OUTPUT IN THE FORM OF METHOD DEVELOPMENT, RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS AND GRADUATE STUDENT THESES IN THE FIELDS OF CORROSION AND RADIATION DAMAGE IN NUCLEAR MATERIALS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f7c481d7-071a-ead9-3bda-e4e7d1e903a7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_23CWDNFE00004_7062"}, {"internal_id": 137360593, "Award ID": "2017DN130NFRA02", "Award Amount": 264000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-17", "CFDA Number": "97.130", "Description": "TACKLING UNCERTAINTIES IN SHORT-LIVED RADIONUCLIDE ANALYSIS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "395e4a2c-bac8-c9f0-4271-75643a4de192-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_2017DN130NFRA02_7062"}, {"internal_id": 88268607, "Award ID": "2017DN130NFRA02", "Award Amount": 382736.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-02", "CFDA Number": "97.130", "Description": "TACKLING UNCERTAINTIES IN SHORT-LIVED RADIONUCLIDE ANALYSIS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "395e4a2c-bac8-c9f0-4271-75643a4de192-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_2017DN130NFRA02_7000"}, {"internal_id": 137360594, "Award ID": "2017DN130NFRA01", "Award Amount": 250000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-17", "CFDA Number": "97.130", "Description": "NUCLEAR FORENSICS RESEARCH AWARD (NFRA): NANOSCALE MASS SPECTROMETRY OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "94d3fccc-8494-b483-af28-4af0be6ed7f8-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_2017DN130NFRA01_7062"}, {"internal_id": 89685685, "Award ID": "2017DN130NFRA01", "Award Amount": 250000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-08-02", "CFDA Number": "97.130", "Description": "NUCLEAR FORENSICS RESEARCH AWARD (NFRA): NANOSCALE MASS SPECTROMETRY OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "94d3fccc-8494-b483-af28-4af0be6ed7f8-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_2017DN130NFRA01_7000"}, {"internal_id": 94045095, "Award ID": "2012DN130NF0001", "Award Amount": 47031.99, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-12-20", "CFDA Number": "97.130", "Description": "NATIONAL NUCLEAR FORENSICS EXPERTISE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2b8556c7-2187-5b5e-d7e5-eb233ef55cb0-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_2012DN130NF0001_7062"}, {"internal_id": 67673401, "Award ID": "2012DN130NF0001", "Award Amount": 10503.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-07-19", "CFDA Number": "97.130", "Description": "NATIONAL NUCLEAR FORENSICS EXPERTISE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2b8556c7-2187-5b5e-d7e5-eb233ef55cb0-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_2012DN130NF0001_7000"}]
