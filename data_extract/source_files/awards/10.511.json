AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES: AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY  UTAH HAS OVER 18,000 FARMS AND RANCHES SPANNING 11 MILLION ACRES, WHICH GENERATE MORE THAN $21 BILLION IN TOTAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT). WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT UTAH BECOMES MORE URBANIZED EACH YEAR, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO PLAY A VITAL PART IN OUR STATE. AS THE POPULATION OF UTAH AND THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO GROW, FOOD PRODUCTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY (USU) EXTENSION HAS LED THE WAY FOR 105 YEARS IN PROVIDING NON-BIASED, RESEARCH-BASED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PRODUCERS AND THE UTAH AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. USU EXTENSION HAS NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FACULTY WITH EXPERTISE IN ALL AREAS OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION AND SCIENCE. OUR ON-CAMPUS AND COUNTY FACULTY CONDUCT CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH THAT IS DISSEMINATED TO PRODUCERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH METHODS SUCH AS FIELD DAYS, WORKSHOPS, PRINTED AND ONLINE PUBLICATIONS, CLASSES, ONLINE COURSES, AND SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS.  EXTENSION CONTINUES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE WHILE EVOLVING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DEVELOPING AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES. AS WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON PERSISTENT AND EMERGING NEEDS, WE RECOGNIZE UTAH IS THE SECOND DRIEST STATE IN THE NATION, SO IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY, WATER CONSERVATION, AND IMPROVED WATER-EFFICIENT CROP VARIETIES CONTINUE TO BE FOCUS AREAS FOR OUR FACULTY AND RESEARCHERS. WITH URBAN AND SMALL FARMS BECOMING MORE POPULAR, EXTENSION FACULTY ARE WORKING WITH PRODUCERS TO FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO PRODUCE FOOD ON MINIMAL ACREAGE. THE LONG-TERM GOALS OF THE AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCE (AG/NR) PROGRAM ARE TO (A) INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY OF UTAH AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS, AND (B) PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE USE THROUGH RELEVANT EDUCATION ON CONSERVATION PRACTICES.  FACULTY INVOLVEDIN AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING CROP AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION, RANGELAND MANAGEMENT, FORESTRY, AND AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS. ALL RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, DEMONSTRATIONS, CONFERENCES, FIELD VISITS, AND CONSULTATIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) AGRONOMY, LIVESTOCK SCIENCE, DROUGHT, FORESTRY, RANGELAND, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, MENTAL HEALTH IN AGRICULTURE, PEST MANAGEMENT, AND WETLANDS.  CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES  THE WESTERN U.S. CONTAINS STATES WITH VAST TRACTS OF PUBLIC LAND SURROUNDING SMALLER AREAS THAT ARE PRIVATELY OWNED, MOSTLY ADJACENT TO WATER. THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASE OF ANY ECONOMY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMIC AND AESTHETIC ENVIRONMENTS FOR THAT AREA. CHANGES IN THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASE BRING VARIATION IN THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE. CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING NATURAL RESOURCE CHARACTERISTICS ARE FOUND IN SOILS, WATER, RANGE, FOREST, ANIMALS, AND AIR RESOURCES. THE PROPER AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS A PRIMARY CONCERN, PARTICULARLY FOR ENVIRONMENTS AS VARIED AND UNIQUE AS IN THE WEST.  THIS CRITICAL ISSUE INVOLVES IMPROVING DECISION-MAKING RELATIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IN AN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND BIOLOGICAL SENSE. USU EXTENSION ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES THROUGH THE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM. THE GOAL OF THIS EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE NON-FORMAL EDUCATION TO RESIDENTS, STAKEHOLDERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE, FACILITATE, AND STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE USE IN UTAH. THIS PROJECT PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON FOREST MANAGEMENT, WATER CONSERVATION, AND STEWARDSHIP OF PUBLICLANDS. THE PROJECT TARGETS ADULTS AND YOUTH, AND THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO (A) EQUIP RESIDENTS WITH THE COMPETENCY TO EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE IN NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION, AND (B) FACILITATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS TO STRENGTHEN NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND ENABLE SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE.  FACULTY INVOLVED IN THE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING WATER MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES, AND TOURISM. ALL RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, DEMONSTRATIONS, CONFERENCES, AND FIELD VISITS ON TOPICS RELATED TO WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY, CLIMATE SCIENCE, BIOMASS, PERMACULTURE, OUTDOOR RECREATION, AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION.FOODSAFETY  WITH A LARGE VARIETY OF FOOD PRODUCTS MOVING THROUGH COMPLEX DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, FOOD SAFETY IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR PRODUCERS, PR OCESSORS, DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, AND THE FINAL CONSUMER. FOODBORNE ILLNESS IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH, CLAIMING THE LIVES OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS; THE ELDERLY, YOUNG, PREGNANT WOMEN, PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRED IMMUNE FUNCTION, AND THE CHRONICALLY ILL. IMPROPER FOOD HANDLING AND PREPARATION OF FOOD IN FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE HOME CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD-BORNE ILLNESSES. THE PUBLIC FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION AIMS TO PROVIDE RELEVANT RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATION TO UTAH RESIDENTS ON BEST PRACTICES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FOOD CONTAMINATION AND FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. THE MAJOR FOCUS AREAS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE FOOD PRESERVATION TECHNIQUES AND HOUSEHOLD FOOD STORAGE.  THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE PUBLIC FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION PROGRAM ARE TO (A) REDUCE THE OCCURRENCES OF FOODBORNE ILLNESSES IN UTAH THROUGH RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATION ON FOOD SAFETY PRACTICES IN HOUSEHOLDS, AND (B) TO REDUCE FOOD CONTAMINATION IN THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN BY PROVIDING RELEVANT EDUCATION ON BEST PRACTICES TO PROCESSORS AND PRODUCERS. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN FOOD SAFETY INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, CONSULTATIONS, AND (VIRTUAL AND FACE-TO-FACE) DEMONSTRATIONS TARGETED AT RESIDENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES ON FOOD PRESERVATION, CANNING, PRESSURE TESTING, FOOD PRODUCT TESTING, AND FOODBORNE ILLNESSES.  NUTRITION AND HEALTH  THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE NUTRITION INFORMATION AND EDUCATION TO THE PUBLIC TO ENABLE CONSUMERS TO MAKE WISE DIETARY CHOICES. AS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIET, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, AND DISEASE PREVENTION BECOME CLEARER, THE PROMOTION OF HEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS AND LIFESTYLES FOR BOTH YOUTH AND ADULTS HAS RECEIVED INCREASED ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. WITH HIGH LEVELS OF OBESITY, CHRONIC DISEASE, AND POOR DIETARY HABITS, THERE IS A NEED FOR NON-FORMAL NUTRITION EDUCATION THAT ADDRESSES INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY HEALTH AND WELLNESS. THE PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION SEEKS TO DECREASE THE INCIDENCES OF CHRONIC DISEASES AND OTHER NUTRITION-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES AMONG RESIDENTS THROUGH NON-FORMAL NUTRITION EDUCATION.  THE PRIORITIES FOR THIS PROGRAM ARE TO EXPAND NUTRITIONAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, AND TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETARY HABITS. THEREFORE, THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE THE PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM ARE TO (A) EMPOWER RESIDENTS TO MAKE HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES AND IMPROVE THEIR NUTRITIONAL INTAKE, AND (B) REDUCE THE ECONOMIC COST OF CHRONIC DISEASES IN UTAH THROUGH ONGOING NUTRITION EDUCATION TO YOUTH AND ADULTS.  FACULTY INVOLVED IN PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING N UTRITION, OBESITY, CHRONIC DISEASES, AND FOOD SCIENCE. RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN NUTRITION AND HEALTH INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND CONSULTATIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO CHRONIC DISEASES, NUTRITION EDUCATION, HEALTHY AND AFFORDABLE RECIPES, DIET BEHAVIOR CHANGES, AND YOUTH NUTRITION.  COMMUNITY RESILIENCE  UTAH CONSISTS OF MANY RURAL COUNTIES SPREAD OUT OVER VAST AREAS OF LAND, AND ONLY A FEW URBAN COUNTIES IN CENTRALIZED LOCATIONS. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN INCREASING DISPARITY IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS IN RURAL COUNTIES. THE MAJORITY OF CURRENT AND NEW JOBS ARE LOCATED ALONG THE URBAN COUNTIES IN THE WASATCH FRONT, INCLUDING JOBS IN THE GROWING TECHNOLOGY SECTOR IN UTAH'S \"SILICON SLOPES.\" IN CONTRAST, RURAL RESIDENTS STRUGGLE TO FIND WELL-PAYING AND STABLE WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ARE OFTEN FACED WITH THE DECISION TO RELOCATE TO URBAN CENTERS. THIS EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC DEPRESSION IN RURAL COUNTIES SINCE RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION LEADS TO LOW PRODUCTIVITY IN THESE COUNTIES. THERE IS A NEED TO SUPPORT RURAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH COMMUNITY AND CAPACITY-BUILDING INITIATIVES.  IN ADDITION TO ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS, INDIVIDUALS IN RURAL COUNTIES SUFFER FROM RELATIVELY HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. THE RATES OF OPIOID OVERDOSES IN RURAL UTAH HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. UTAH HAD EIGHT (8) OUT OF 10 ADULT OVERDOSE DEATHS EACH WEEK DUE TO OPIOIDS IN 2019, AND HALF OF THOSE WERE SPECIFICALLY DUE TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS (UTAH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH [UDOH] INDICATOR-BASED SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH [IBIS], 2021). IN 2020, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CREATED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING INCREASES IN OPIOID-RELATED DEATHS DUE TO FENTANYL.  THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION IS TO STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES ACROSS UTAH THROUGH FACILITATED COMMUNITY-FOCUSED COALITIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS, ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION, AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMESOF THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES PROGRAM ARE TO (A) CONNECT RURAL COMMUNITIES TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN URBAN CENTERS THROUGH INNOVATIVE WORKPLACE PRACTICES (E.G., REMOTE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS), AND (B) FACILITATE EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS, AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COALITIONS TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS IN RURAL COUNTIES. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN COMMUNITY RESILIENCE INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND INTERVENTIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, RURAL EMPLOYMENT, REMOTE WORKING, BUILDING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COALITIONS, AND TRIBAL INITIATIVES.  INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  UTAH IS IN THE TOP 5 U.S. STATES WITH BANKRUPTCY, AND THERE IS A NEED FOR OUTREACH EDUCATION TO FACILITATE IMPROVED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. BECAUSE OF UTAH'S TYPICALLY LARGER FAMILY SIZE, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME AVAILABLE FOR BASIC FAMILY NEEDS SLIPS BELOW THE MEAN FOR THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. UTAH FAMILIES ALREADY FACE HIGH DEBT LOADS LEADING TO BANKRUPTCY, LOW SAVINGS, AND A LACK OF LIQUID ASSETS. HENCE, THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PLANNED EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO ENHANCE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (FRM).  FRM, WHICH RELATES TO FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, ALSO TIES TO OTHER ASPECTS OF FAMILY HEALTH, SUCH AS HEALTHY MARITAL AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. AS A BROAD PROGRAM AREA, THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES YOUTH, ADULTS, AND FAMILIES IN UTAH. DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO; (A) STRENGTHEN FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND (B) IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES.  FACULTY INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCT RESEARCH IN FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING, RELATIONSHIPS, AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THE RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN COMMUNITY RESILIENCE INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, CONFERENCES, AND CONSULTATIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, HOMEOWNER AND HOMEBUYER EDUCATION, FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, COUPLES, AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND MENTAL WELLNESS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d345a8ea-b0ac-7e5d-b949-6507917f2140-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLSNXXXXG016_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736098, "Award ID": "NI23SLSNXXXXG015", "Award Amount": 43951.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "PROJECT ABSTRACT FOR SMITH LEVER SPECIAL NEEDS CAPACITY GRANT UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING EXTENSION WYOMING IS THE LEAST POPULATED STATE IN THE NATION WITH 576,851 PEOPLE SPREAD OUT ACROSS 97,089 SQUARE MILES, 99.8 PERCENT OF WHICH IS RURAL. CHEYENNE, THE CAPITAL AND LARGEST CITY, HAS A POPULATION OF 65,132 AND IS LOCATED IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF WYOMING. THE STATE IS DIVIDED INTO 23 COUNTIES AND THE WIND RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION. MOST OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY IS CONCENTRATED IN THREE SECTORS: AGRICULTURE, MINERALS, AND TOURISM. THE STATE IS A MAJOR PRODUCER OF BEEF, SHEEP, WOOL, WIND ENERGY, COAL, AND NATURAL GAS. ACCORDING TO THE 2017 CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE, WYOMING PRODUCERS OPERATED THE LARGEST FARMS AND RANCHES IN THE U.S. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 2,430 ACRES PER FARM, OVER FIVE TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE SIZE. THOUGH, THERE ARE 231 FARMS ON THE WIND RIVER RESERVATION WITH 90% BEING UNDER 1,000 ACRES. ONE FIFTH OF WYOMING FARMS DO NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS. WYOMING FARMERS AND RANCHERS FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES BEING ISOLATED FROM MANY SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND SERVICES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF AGRICULTURE ENTERPRISES. ADDITIONALLY, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS ARE DEALING WITH INCREASED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH WEATHER VARIABILITY AND CHANGING CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. BASED UPON COUNTY AVERAGES, WYOMING AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS' NET INCOMES WERE 47% LESS THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE; THEIR INCOME LOSSES WERE 25% GREATER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE; AND THEIR INCOME GAINS WERE 23% LESS THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING EXTENSION (UWE) WILL ENHANCE CAPACITY FOR SUCCESS AND THE RESILIENCY OF WYOMING FARMERS, RANCHERS, AND SMALL ACREAGE OWNERS WHO ARE TOO SMALL AND/OR WHO HAVE LOW PRODUCTIVITY TO INCREASE DIVERSIFICATION OF THEIR ENTERPRISE(S); ENCOURAGE NEW MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT ENHANCE SUSTAINABILITY; AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND TOOLS TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER MANAGEMENT OF AG OPERATIONS TO A DIFFERENT GENERATION. EXAMPLES OF EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS ARE OUTLINED BELOW: O EFFECTIVE GENERATIONAL TRANSITION OF MANAGEMENT IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF WYOMING AGRICULTURE. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS CAN ENSURE THAT THE NEXT GENERATION HAS ACCESS TO THE TOOLS, KNOWLEDGE, AND RESOURCES NEEDED FOR VIABLE AND PROGRESSIVE WYOMING FARMS AND RANCHES. O WYOMING LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS AND OWNERS MUST CONSTANTLY MANAGE HERD/FLOCK HEALTH AND DISEASE ISSUES. FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE HEALTH AND DISEASE CONCERNS COULD BE DEVASTATING TO THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND WELL-BEING OF ALL WYOMING LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS. UWE WILL PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO DECREASE LIVESTOCK DEATH AND ECONOMIC LOSSES AS WELL AS SUPPORT PRODUCERS TO RECEIVE \"BEST PRACTICE\" CERTIFICATIONS FOR THEIR OPERATION. AN EXAMPLE OF A BEST PRACTICE CERTIFICATION IS THE BEEF QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. O KNOWLEDGE OF DISASTER RESOURCES, DEVELOPMENT OF DISASTER PLANS, AND EFFECTIVE DECISION-MAKING STRATEGIES WILL ALSO PREPARE INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL DISASTERS AND ENGAGE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES TO REDUCE THEIR VULNERABILITY TO DISASTERS. O DIVERSIFICATION OF CROPS AND OUTPUTS WILL BRING ECONOMIC VALUE AND SUSTAINABILITY TO WYOMING FARMERS. LONGER, MORE DIVERSE CROP ROTATIONS INCREASE SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND NITROGEN, AND SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS. HEALTHY SOILS CAN INCREASE INCOME THROUGH INCREASING YIELDS AND REDUCING PRODUCTION COSTS BY PROVIDING BETTER NUTRIENT AND WATER USE EFFICIENCIES, IMPROVING RESISTANCE TO DISEASE AND INSECT DAMAGE, AND BY REDUCING TILLAGE PASSES. TO INCREASE SOIL HEALTH, UWE WILL WORK WITH PRODUCERS TO IDENTIFY DIVERSE CROP ROTATIONS AND FACILITATE ADOPTION OF REDUCED-TILLAGE PRACTICES IN INTENSIVE IRRIGATED CROPPING SYSTEMS. O INVASIVE WEEDS CAN CHANGE THE ECOLOGY OF A LANDSCAPE BY REPLACING NATIVE VEGETATION WHICH WILL HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON SOIL HEALTH, WILDLIFE BOTH INVERTEBRATES AND VERTEBRATES, AND LIVESTOCK. LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT INVASIVE WEEDS CAUSE A REDUCTION IN FORAGE AND SEEK EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND TRIALS TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF INVASIVE WEEDS. LANDOWNERS AND LAND MANAGERS PARTICIPATING IN UWE PROGRAMS WILL SEE REDUCED AREAS INFESTED WITH INVASIVE AND NOXIOUS WEEDS. O REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE PRACTICES IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND FUNCTION OF SOIL. THESE BENEFITS LEAD TO BETTER NUTRIENT CYCLING, IMPROVED WATER INFILTRATION AND MORE CONSISTENT YIELDS OVER TIME. ADDITIONALLY, COVER CROPS SUPPRESS WEEDS, PREVENT EROSION, CONTROL DISEASES AND PESTS AS WELL AS HELP POLLINATORS. REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE PRACTICES ARE ALSO USED TO PROVIDE FORAGE FOR LIVESTOCK. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ASSIST PRODUCERS IN GATHERING RESOURCES ON COVER CROP OPTIONS, HOW TO PLANT AND STRATEGIES FOR USE. INTEREST IN REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE PRACTICES HAS GROWN AS PRODUCERS HAVE SEEN INCREASED FORAGE SUPPLY, GROWING FORAGES IN PLACES THAT HAD BEEN UNPRODUCTIVE, AND IN WEED CONTROL EFFORTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "961d0f85-7803-bf5a-32c5-a4ea8ffa3dbb-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLSNXXXXG015_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735893, "Award ID": "NI23SLSNXXXXG014", "Award Amount": 111504.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "ARIZONA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION IS A DIVERSE ORGANIZATION WITH A BROAD MISSION DIRECTED AT SERVING THE NEEDS OF ARIZONA.

THE KSRE NETWORK INCLUDES OFFICES IN ALL 105 COUNTIES, ALONG WITH FOUR REGIONAL EXTENSION OFFICES, FIVE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENCOMPASS VARIABILITY IN CLIMATE AND SOILS, FOUR SATELLITE UNITS, FOUR AGRONOMY EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND FOUR HORTICULTURE CENTERS AND EXPERIMENT FIELDS. IN ADDITION, KSRE FUNDS RESEARCH PROJECTS IN 20 DEPARTMENTS ACROSS FIVE COLLEGES. A UNIQUE FEATURE WITHIN THE K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION ORGANIZATION IS THE CLOSE ALIGNMENT OF RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. IN 1996, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION WAS FORMED BY ALIGNING THE KANSAS AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (KAES) AND THE KANSAS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE. THE STRATEGIC INTENT OF THIS ALIGNMENT WAS TO ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCY AND SYNERGY BETWEEN DISCOVERY AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. ONE ANCILLARY BENEFIT OF THIS ALIGNMENT IS THAT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO RAPID EXTENSION PROGRAMMING AND APPLICATION IN THE FIELD. THIS ALIGNMENT ALSO ALLOWS MORE FLUID COMPLIANCE WITH MULTI-STATE AND INTEGRATED COMPONENTS OF AREERA. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSING ITS EFFORTS ON FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES (CRITICAL ISSUES) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT ALL KANSANS: GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES, HEALTH, DEVELOPING TOMORROWS LEADERS, AND COMMUNITY VITALITY. THESE GRAND CHALLENGES WERE DETERMINED THROUGH A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND DEFINE AREAS OF EMPHASIS FOR AGENTS, SPECIALISTS, AND RESEARCHERS. EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS AT THE LOCAL, REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL WORK TO DEVELOP REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE SIGNATURE PROGRAMS ALONG WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS MEMBERS THROUGH 11 PROGRAM FOCUS TEAMS ADULT DEVELOPMENT AND AGING; COMMUNITY VITALITY; CROP PRODUCTION; FAMILY AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT; FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; FARM MANAGEMENT; HORTICULTURE; LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; NATURAL RESOURCES; NUTRITION, FOOD SAFETY AND HEALTH; AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, TWO TRANSDISCIPLINARY TEAMS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS COMPLEX ISSUES TO KANSANS - LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS AND STRESS AND RESILIENCY. THE WORK OF THESE TEAMS FALLS WITHIN THE OVERALL UMBRELLA OF THE FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CANNOT SOLVE THESE CHALLENGES ALONE. KSRES STATEWIDE PRESENCE LENDS ITSELF TO COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH ORGANIZATIONS, PRIVATE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY, LOCAL GROUPS, STATE AND FEDERAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES.

CHANGES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THIS AGING DEMOGRAPHIC ARE EXPECTED IN HEALTH AND WELLNESS; HOME AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS; AGRICULTURE; COMMUNITY LIFE AND THE ECONOMY. TOO MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL CRISIS BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE SAVINGS AND TOO MUCH DEBT. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION STRATEGIES CAN ENHANCE FAMILY LIFE ISSUES SUCH AS BUILDING FINANCIAL SECURITY, COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP, YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AND CONNECT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT RESOURCES. HEART DISEASE, CANCER, STROKE, AND DIABETES ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOP LEADING SEVEN CAUSES OF DEATH IN SOUTH DAKOTA AND STRESS-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE ON THE RISE. LIVING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE GREATLY REDUCES A PERSON'S RISK FOR DEVELOPING CHRONIC DISEASE. LOCAL GARDENS, HIGH-TUNNELS, AND GREENHOUSE FACILITIES HELP INCREASE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION IN THE STATE. AQUAPONICS, A SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION METHOD THAT COMBINES ADVANCED AQUACULTURE WITH HYDROPONICS, IS ON THE RISE IN SD TO MEET THE NEED FOR MORE FRESH PRODUCE. NATURAL FERMENTATION PROCESSES REPLACE CHEMICAL ADDITIVES FOR EXTENDING SHELF-LIFE OF FOODS AND BEVERAGES. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE DIETARY AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES CAN REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF CHRONIC DISEASE ACROSS THE STATE'S POPULATION. REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE BUILDS THE SOIL THROUGH PROPER MANAGEMENT WHICH INCLUDES MINIMIZING OR ELIMINATING TILLAGE, DIVERSIFIED ROTATIONS, AND INTEGRATING LIVESTOCK INTO CROPPING SYSTEMS, WHICH RESULTS IN INCREASED TOPSOIL, SOIL CARBON, AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY. USING REGENERATIVE METHODS CAN ALLOW SOUTH DAKOTA FARMERS TO PRIORITIZE CARING FOR THE SOIL TO PUT HIGH-QUALITY, NUTRITIOUS FOOD DIRECTLY INTO THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO LACK ACCESS. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION STRATEGIES LEAD TO INCREASED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF PLANT DISEASES, PESTS, AND NEW PLANT VARIETIES. FARMERS RELY ON THE DISSEMINATION OF SCIENCE-BASED KNOWLEDGE ON SOIL FERTILITY, PRECISION AGRICULTURE, GENETICS, GENOMICS, HORTICULTURE, ENVIRONMENTAL PRESERVATION, WEED SCIENCE, AND PRESERVING WATER QUALITY. DUE TO SHIFTING POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS, AND CHANGING CULTURAL AND SOCIETAL STANDARDS, THE PERCEPTIONS OF LIVESTOCK UTILIZATION AND HUSBANDRY CONTINUE TO BE UNDER SCRUTINY. IN ADDITION, THE DEMAND TO PRODUCE MORE FOOD WITH FEWER RESOURCES CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE TO LIVESTOCK HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY. ACCORDING TO THE USDA CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE, THE AVERAGE AGE OF U.S. PRODUCERS IS 58.3. PRODUCERS WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT CROP AND LIVESTOCK REINTEGRATION, PRECISION LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION IN CONFINED AND RANGE SETTINGS, AS WELL AS FACTORS THAT IMPACT EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR FEEDING PROGRAMS. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION STRATEGIES CAN INCREASE PROFITABILITY, OPTIMIZE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, ENHANCE LEARNING COMMUNITIES, AND INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE CONSUMER AND FOOD SERVICE SIDE OF THE BEEF INDUSTRY. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 19 MILLION ACRES OF CROPLAND AND 23 MILLION ACRES OF PERMANENT PASTURE AND RANGELAND IN SOUTH DAKOTA. RANGELAND IS THE LIFELINE OF STREAMS, PONDS, AND LAKES, AND IT IS A SOURCE OF WILDLIFE HABITAT, RECREATION, AND SCENIC BEAUTY. AS AN AGRICULTURAL RESOURCE, CROPLAND HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC, AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL WELL-BEING OF THE STATE.

EXTENSION ALSO INCLUDES CAMPUS-BASED SPECIALISTS AND ASSOCIATE SPECIALISTS WHO BRIDGE INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, AND STATE EXPERTISE TO COMMUNITIES, STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. MOST PROJECTS ARE BORN DIRECTLY FROM THE CHALLENGES AND DESIRES OF THE STATE'S PEOPLE. OFTEN, PROJECTS HAVE TREMENDOUS LOCAL IMPACT. MANY ARE TIGHTLY LINKED WITH LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL PRIORITIES FROM A DIVERSITY OF SUPPORTING AGENCIES. FOR MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP PURPOSES, THE STATE IS DIVIDED INTO THREE REGIONS-EAST, CENTRAL AND WEST-WITH EXTENSION DEPARTMENT HEADS LEADING EACH REGION. EXTENSION LEVERAGES SMITH LEVER DOLLARS WITH COUNTY CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUPPORT SALARIES AND OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR MONTANA'S 94 COUNTY AND RESERVATION EXTENSION AGENTS. EXTENSION'S MAIN PROGRAM AREAS ARE AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES, 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. MANY MSU FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE APPOINTMENTS THAT SPAN TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND OUTREACH, WITH THEIR FTE SPLIT BETWEEN COA, MAES, AND EXTENSION. EXTENSION ALSO HAS FACULTY IN THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND THE COLLEGE OF LETTERS AND SCIENCE. COLLECTIVELY, HATCH, SMITH-LEVER, STATE OF MONTANA, AND COUNTY AND LOCAL FUNDING CONTINUE TO ALLOW MSU'S FACULTY TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF MONTANA, EXPLORE UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO PRESSING QUESTIONS, AND SOLVE GLOBAL PROBLEMS. THESE FUNDS PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR COA/MAES AND EXTENSION TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE FOR COMPLEMENTARY GRANT FUNDING. MSU CONTINUES ITS ROLE AS THE HOSTING INSTITUTION FOR THE WESTERN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION (SARE) PROGRAM. SARE IS A USDA PROGRAM THAT OPERATESWITH COMPETITIVE GRANTS CONDUCTED COOPERATIVELY BY FARMERS, RANCHERS, RESEARCHERS, AND AG PROFESSIONALS TO ADVANCE FARM AND RANCH SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROFITABLE, ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND, AND GOOD FOR COMMUNITIES. ALL SARE-FUNDED PROJECTS ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH COMPONENTS IN THEIR DESIGN. MONTANA IS HOME TO THE MOST LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION. IN ADDITION TO MSU, WHICH IS PART OF THE ORIGINAL MORRILL ACT OF 1862, THERE ARE SEVEN TRIBAL COLLEGES THAT RECEIVED THE DESIGNATION THROUGH THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1994. THESE INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR TRIBAL AFFILIATIONS ARE: AANIJIH NAKODA COLLEGE (GROS VENTRE AND ASSINIBOINE), BLACKFEET COMMUNITY COLLEGE (BLACKFEET), CHIEF DULL KNIFE COLLEGE (NORTHERN CHEYENNE), FORT PECK COMMUNITY COLLEGE (SIOUX AND ASSINIBOINE), LITTLE BIG HORN COLLEGE (CROW), SALISH KOOTENAI COLLEGE (BITTERROOT SALISH, KOOTENAI, AND PEND D'OREILLE KOOTENAI OF THE FLATHEAD NATION) AND STONE CHILD COLLEGE (CHIPPEWA-CREE). IN ADDITION, FOUR OF THE RESERVATIONS PARTNER WITH MSU EXTENSION THROUGH THE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBAL EXTENSION PROGRAM (FRTEP). THE BLACKFEET, FLATHEAD, FORT BELKNAP, AND FORT PECK RESERVATIONS ALL HAVE EXTENSION AGENTS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AND PERFORM DUTIES MUCH LIKE COUNTY AGENTS. MSU RECENTLY ADOPTED A NEW 2019-2024 STRATEGIC PLAN: CHOOSING PROMISE HTTP://WWW.MONTANA.EDU/STRATEGICPLAN/INDEX.HTML. THE PLAN INCLUDES THREE CENTRAL PRIORITIES: TRANSFORMATIONAL LEARNING, SCHOLARSHIP THAT IMPROVES LIVES, AND EXPANDING ENGAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN IDENTIFIES FOUR GRAND CHALLENGES OF PARTICULAR FOCUS FOR MSU. THESE ARE: CARING FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE, DESIGN, ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE; PROMOTING WELLNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES: ACCESS AND EQUALITY IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH OUTCOMES, COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH, BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP; FOOD AND FUEL SECURITY: SUSTAINED FOODSYSTEMS, PRECISION AGRICULTURE, ENERGY PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE; AND SECURING THE FUTURE OF MONTANA: CYBERSECURITY, PHOTONICS AND OPTICS, DEFENSE, GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC POLICY. IN FEBRUARY 2020, THE COA/MAES ADOPTED ITS COLLEGE AND EXPERIMENT STATION-SPECIFIC STRATEGIC PLAN, HTTP://AG.MONTANA.EDU/STRATEGICPL AN.HTML. THE FIVE-YEAR PLAN WAS DEVELOPED OVER A 9-MONTH PERIOD WITH INPUT FROM FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS, ALUMNI, AND MONTANA COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO LOOK TO COA/MAES TO PROVIDE IMPACTFUL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. THE PLAN IS INTENDED TO GUIDE THE COLLEGE AND EXPERIMENT STATION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND SETS OUT GOALS THAT WILL ENSURE THE GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION, TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH, AND ENGAGING OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT MONTANA AND BEYOND. THE PLAN HAS SEVEN FOCUS AREAS, WITH 2-3 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES FOR EACH FOCUS AREA. THE FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE: A PEOPLE-DRIVEN ENVIRONMENT; IMPACTFUL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; TRANSFORMATIONAL TEACHING ANDLEARNING; EFFECTIVE AND INCLUSIVE ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH; STRENGTHENING AND GROWING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS; STRATEGIC STEWARDSHIP OF RESOURCES; AND TRANSPARENT AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION. THE COA/MAES STRATEGIC PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE DIRECTION FOR THE COLLEGE AND EXPERIMENT STATION TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES TOWARD MEETING ITS MISSIONS, AND TO ALIGN WITH THE MSU CHOOSING PROMISE STRATEGIC PLAN. THE CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY MSU ALIGN WITH THE BASIC PROGRAM AREAS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN PART OF COA/MAES AND EXTENSION. THE SPECIFICS WILL CONTINUE TO BE REFINED WITH THE NEW PLAN OF WORK PROCESS. THE CRITICAL ISSUES ARE AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM AREAS PROVIDE SPECIFIC SUPPORT FOR THE CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY COA/MAES AND MSUE. ANIMAL SCIENCES ENCOMPASSES RESEARCH, TEACHING, AND ENGAGEMENT PRIORITIES IN ANIMAL HEALTH IN DIRECT CORRELATION WITH HUMANS, LIVEST OCK, OR FOOD PRODUCTS. PRIMARY RESEARCH VEINS REFLECTIVE OF THESE AREAS ARE: VACCINATIONS, NUTRIENT UTILIZATION, REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE, ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY, ZOONOTIC DISEASES, EXTERNAL PARASITES, ANIMAL DISEASES, GENETIC IMPROVEMENT OF ANIMALS, AND MANAGEMENT OF RANGE RESOURCES. MSU RESEARCH, EXTENSION AND COA ARE PARTNERS WITH PRODUCERS TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND MEET THE NEEDS OF MONTANA'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. PLANT SCIENCES: THE BROADER IMPACT OF THE PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCES FIELD IS A LARGER AND HIGHER QUALITY FOOD SUPPLY FOR THE WORLD, AS WELL AS THE IMPROVED ABILITY OF MONTANA FARMERS TO COMPETE IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND STRENGTHEN EXPORT MARKETS FOR U.S. WHEAT AND OTHER PRODUCTS. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES IN PLANT SCIENCES ADDRESS BASIC PLANT SCIENCE, GENOMICS AND PATHOLOGY THAT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON INCREASING YIELD POTENTIAL, IMPROVING WINTER HARDINESS, ENHANCING DISEASE RESISTANCE, AND IMPROVING DUAL-PURPOSE END-USE QUALITY GRAINS. ADDITIONALLY, THE SCIENCE OF GROWINGAND MAINTAINING PLANTS FOR FOOD, ENJOYMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO BE OF PRIMARY SIGNIFICANCE TO COA, MAES, AND EXTENSION EFFORTS. MSU EXTENSION'S HORTICULTURE PROGRAMS, PUBLICATIONS AND LINKS PROVIDE EXPERT YARD, GARDEN AND URBAN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT MONTANA. FARM, RANCH, AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT: COA, MAES AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL SUPPORT MONTANANS IN MANAGING THEIR FARMS, RANCHES, AND SIMILAR ENTERPRISES AS BUSINESSES. BEST PRACTICES, CONTRACTS, ESTATE PLANNING, MARKETING, TAXATION, ACCOUNTING, OPERATIONAL PLANNING, BUDGETING, AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND COMMODITY SUPPORT PROGRAMS, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE FOR AGRICULTURE ARE ALL COVERED THROUGH EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT MONTANA'S NUMBER ONE INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT: AN INCREASE IN PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT FOOD SAFETY, QUALITY, COST, BIODIVERSITY, AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES SUCH AS SOIL, AIR, AND WATER QUALITY IS PUSHING SCIENTISTS IMPROVE INTEGRATED PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DISTRIBUTION OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS AS LOW-IMPACT PEST CONTROL OPTIONS PROMOTES SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES. PRODUCERS AND RESEARCHERS CONTINUE TO EVALUATE NEW INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) METHODOLOGIES SO THEY CAN MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE POSITION IN U.S. AND WORLD MARKETS WHILE HELPING ALLEVIATE GLOBAL HUNGER. THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT REMAINS A CONSISTENTLY CRITICAL FIELD AS INVASIVE SPECIES CONTINUE TO THREATEN MONTANA'S WILD AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS AS WELL AS THE GLOBAL SAFETY OF THE STATE'S FOOD EXPORTS. ENERGY <(>&<)> NATURAL RESOURCES: ENERGY PRODUCTION AND NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN MONTANA'S HISTORY AND CONTINUES TO BE A PRIORITY FOR EXTENSION AND MAES. IN ADDITION, FORESTS COVER LARGE AREAS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMIC BASE OF THE STATE WHILE ALSO SERVING AS A CRITICAL NATURALRESOURCE FOR WILDLIFE, RECREATION, TOURISM, AND CULTURAL PURPOSES. MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHIP IS REQUIRED TO MAXIMIZE POTENTIAL OUTPUTS, AS WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY, AND A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. WATER QUALITY AFFECTS ALL ENTITIES AND REQUIRES INTENTIONAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. RANGELAND ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF INVASIVE SPECIES IS ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT. EXTENSION AND MAES PROVIDE UNBIASED, SCIENCE-BASED RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH RELATED TO PRESERVING AND SUPPORTING THE BEST USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES. YOUTH AND FAMILY DEVELOPMENT: POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OCCURS THROUGH PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES, CHOICES, RELATIONSHIPS, AND THE SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR YOUTH TO FULLY PARTICIPATE. YOUTH DEVELOPMENT TAKES PLACE IN FAMILIES, PEER GROUPS, SCHOOLS, NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES. ACROSS THE STATE, FAMILIES ARE CONCERNED WITH HELPING YOUTH BUILD SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE TO BECOME COMPETENT, CONTRIBUTING, AND CARING CITIZENS. MSU EXTENSION PROVIDES THE SUPPORT AND FRAMEWORK FOR MONTANA'S LARGEST YOUTH DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION, MONTANA 4-H. MSU EXTENSION AND MAES RECOGNIZE THAT FAMILIES NOT ALL THE SAME AND OFFER RESOURCES AND TRAINING TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE DIVERSE SITUATIONS. MONTANANS DESIRE RESOURCES THAT HELP THEM BECOME BETTER CAREGIVERS FOR ELDERLY OR DISABLED FRIENDS AND FAMILY; AND TO SUPPORT FAMILY MEMBERS, OFTEN GRANDCHILDREN, WHO ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES. THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR OWN AGING PROCESS AND VALUE RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE, HELP MANAGE THEIR PERSONAL FINANCES, CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH OF THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND PREPARE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR ESTATES. THEY OFTEN LOOK TO MSU EXTENSION FOR SOLUTIONS AND RESOURCES. HEALTHY LIVING, NUTRITION<(>&<)> FOOD SAFETY: IN MONTANA, HEART DISEASE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH WHILE DIABETES, STROKE, OSTEOPOROSIS, AND HYPERTENSION, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND EARLY DETECTION OF SYMPTOMS CAN PREVENT OR DELAY THESE DISEASES SAVING MILLIONS IN HEALTH CARE COSTS WHILE IMPROVING LIFE QUALITY AND ABILITY TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT. UTILIZING ITS NETWORK ACROSS THE STATE AND THE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS WITH AGENTS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES, MSU EXTENSION WORKS WITH THE MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND OTHER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING IN EVERY COUNTY AND RESERVATION. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: MONTANA'S LARGE SIZE AND SMALL POPULATION SPREAD OVER A WIDE RANGE OF LANDSCAPES CREATES UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES. MSU EXTENSION AGENTS LIVE AND WORK IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AND PROVIDE A HISTORICAL, TRUSTED LINK CONNECTING LEADERS AND INTEREST GROUPS WITH A FOCUS ON EFFORTS TOWARD COMMUNITY VITALITY.

IT COSTS NEW MEXICO MORE THAN $31.00/ACRE ANNUALLY. COVER CROPPING ENHANCES SOIL HEALTH BY REDUCING EROSION, WEED DENSITY, SOIL COMPACTION, AND INCREASING SOIL ORGANIC MATTER, WATER RETENTION, AND NITROGEN. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF COVER CROPPING, GROWERS ARE RELUCTANT TO ADOPT THE TECHNOLOGY. AN NMSU STUDY SHOWS THAT A $50.00/ACRE SUBSIDY THROUGH THE 'HEALTHY SOIL PROGRAM' WOULD MAKE COVER CROPPING PROFITABLE AND ENHANCE SUSTAINABILITY. MORE WORK IS NEEDED IN THIS AREA TO OFFER A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO DEAL WITH NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S WORKING LANDS. MUCH OF RURAL NEW MEXICO STRUGGLES WITH FOOD INSECURITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES. IN RESPONSE, CES ALONG WITH A SPECIAL L EGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION HAS LAUNCHED AN AGRIBUSINESS ACCELERATOR PILOT PROJECT IN NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO, ANCHORED BY A THREE-ACRE DEMONSTRATION AND TRAINING FARM. PROJECT GOALS INCLUDE INCREASING THE SUPPLY, ACCESSIBILITY, AND CONSUMPTION OF LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD, INCREASING VALUE-ADDED AGRIBUSINESS ACTIVITY AND FOSTERING ENTREPRENEURSHIP, BUSINESS GROWTH, AND JOB CREATION IN THE REGION. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PROJECT WILL INFORM FUTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE STATE'S RURAL COMMUNITIES. FIELD DEMONSTRATIONS FOUND THAT BIOENERGY CROPS COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY GROWN WITH SALINE WASTEWATER. RESEARCHERS ALSO FOUND THAT EDIBLE PRODUCE GROWN IN THE ANIMAS RIVER WATERSHED IS GENERALLY SAFE TO CONSUME, HELPING TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR AGRICULTURAL MARKETS. A GREENHOUSE STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT HEMP, SUNFLOWER, AND CANOLA (ALL BIOENERGY CROPS), ARE CAPABLE OF EXTRACTING URANIUM AND RADIUM FROM CONTAMINATED MINE SOILS AND MAY BE EFFECTIVELY USED IN PHYTOREMEDIATION EFFORTS AND A FAR REDUCED COST COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL CLEANUP METHODS. ANOTHER STUDY SHOWED THAT ADDING DUCKWEED (LIMNA MINOR L.) TO IRON-CONTAMINATED WATER HELPED LOWER THE CONCENTRATION OF THE METAL, PROBABLY BY SURFACE ABSORPTION AND PHYSICAL REMOVAL. COVID RESTRICTIONS IN 2020 LIMITED FIELD AND LAB ACCESS, SLOWING DOWN COLLECTION AND ANALYSES OF SAMPLES AND RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO MEET VARIOUS MILESTONES. THEREFORE ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED IN THIS AREA TO RESPOND TO NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. NEW MEXICO GENERATES $6 BILLION IN REVENUE THROUGH AGRICULTURE WHEN FOOD PROCESSING IS INCLUDED, $11 BILLION. SMALL GROWERS ARE LOOKING TO GET A SHARE OF THE MARKET. NMSU CES PROPOSED PROGRAMMING AND ACTIVITIES TO FACILITATE INTELLIGENT SUPPLY CHAINS FOR FRESH PRODUCE THAT WOULD ALLOW DEMAND AGGREGATION (AT THE ORIGIN) AND DISAGGREGATION (AT THE DESTINATION) TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR SMALL GROWERS TO DIRECTLY SERVE DISTANT MARKETS. THESE SUPPLY CHAINS WOULD BE HIGHLY FLEXIBLE, MARKET-RESPONSIVE, AND DRIVEN BY AN ANALYTICAL ENGINE BUILT IN AN INTEGRATED INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. THE PROPOSED ENVIRONMENT ENCOMPASSES SUPPLY CHAIN PLANNING, INFORMATION, AND TECHNOLOGY-BASED TOOLS ANTICIPATED TO HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR SMALL AND MICRO-GROWERS AS THEY COMPETE WITH LARGE, VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISES WHO HAVE ACCESS TO EFFICIENT INFORMATION AND SUPPLY CHAIN PLANNING SYSTEMS. THIS WORK CLEARLY ADDRESSES THE NEED TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN NEW MEXICO'S RURAL COMMUNITIES. CORN PLANTING DATE AND PLANT DENSITY EVALUATION IS VERY IMPORTANT UNDER CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS. IT PROVIDES LOCAL GROWERS, EXTENSION WORKERS, AND SEED INDUSTRY PERSONNEL WITH ACCURATE, UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON PLANTING WINDOW AND OPTIMUM PLANT POPULATION UNDER LOCAL CONDITIONS FOR AVOIDING CROP FAILURE AND IMPROVING RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY. GIVEN THAT CORN AND CORN PRODUCTS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMMODITY IN NORTHERN NEW MEXICO, INFO RMATION REGARDING THE CORN PLANTING WINDOW AND OPTIMUM PLANT POPULATION ARE HELPFUL FOR GROWERS TO INCREASE CORN YIELDS, IMPROVE WATER PRODUCTIVITY, AND OBTAIN THE MAXIMUM ECONOMIC RETURNS FROM THEIR CORN PRODUCTION. AN NMSU STUDY SHOWS THAT CORN COULD BE PLANTED AS EARLY AS APRIL 20 UNTIL MAY 25 UNDER THE OPTIMUM PLANT POPULATION OF 36,000 PLANTS PER ACRE (88,900 PLANTS PER HECTARE). PLANTING AFTER MAY 25 PUTS THE PLANT AT RISK OF EARLY FALL FROST THAT REDUCES YIELD AND THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT. CONTINUED DISSEMINATION OF THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION AS NEW MEXICANS ADAPT TO THE NEED FOR MORE EFFICIENT FARMING PRACTICES TO DEAL WITH NEGATIVE GROWING EFFECTS CREATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, DROUGHT, CHANGES IN WEATHER PATTERNS, ETC. NEW MEXICO IS UNDER CONTINUED DROUGHT AND SURFACE WATER AVAILABILITY FOR IRRIGATION IS GETTING LIMITED. THIS IS FORCING GROWERS TO INCREASE THE USE OF GROUNDWATER TO SUPPLEMENT THE IRRIGATION SHORTFALLS. IN NEW MEXICO, GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS ARE NOT CONTIGUOUS AND ARE OF VARIABLE SALINITY. WATER EVEN IF SALINE MUST BE USED FOR IRRIGATION TO SUSTAIN AGRICULTURE IN THE VALLEY. BRACKISH WATER CAN BE TREATED USING REVERSE OSMOSIS (RO), HOWEVER, THE PROCESS GENERATES A HIGHLY SALINE CONCENTRATE. THE REUSE OF RO CONCENTRATE FOR IRRIGATION CAN INCREASE THE IRRIGATION WATER PORTFOLIO. THEREFORE, SALINITY TOLERANCE OF DIFFERENT CROPS OF SOUTHERN NM NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED AND AVAILABLE IRRIGATION WATER ACROSS SALINITY GRADIENT SHOULD BE APPLIED ACROSS A CROPPING PATTERN THAT INCLUDES FOOD AND FORAGE CROPS INCLUDING HALOPHYTES. NMSU HAS STARTED RESEARCH IN GREENHOUSES AND TESTED A SUITE OF CROPS GROWN IN NM. THESE CROPS INCLUDE CHILE PEPPERS, TOMATO, PECAN, AND ALFALFA. HALOPHYTES OR SALT-TOLERANT CROPS TESTED ARE SWITCHGRASS, TRITICALE, BARLEY, MESA PEPPERWORT, FOURWING SALTBUSH, AND INLAND SALTGRASS. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATED THAT PECAN AND TOMATOES ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO SALINITY AND CONTINUOUS IRRIGATION WOULD SEVERELY AFFECT YIELDS. SALINE WATER IRRIGATION INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS IN CHILE PEPPERS BUT OV ERTIME YIELDS DECREASED WITH INCREASING SALINITY. SALINE IRRIGATION INCREASED TOTAL SOLUBLE SUGAR CONTENT IN TOMATOES BUT WITH INCREASING SALINITY YIELD DECREASED. THE RESEARCH ESTABLISHED TRITICALE AS A HALOPHYTE, NOT A MARGINAL AS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE, AND SHOWED THAT UNDER HIGHLY SALINE CONDITIONS IT CAN BE GROWN IN PLACE OF ALFALFA. OVERALL, A NOVEL IRRIGATION SCHEDULING IS NEEDED THAT IS BASED ON MANAGING TWIN ABIOTIC STRESSES OF WATER AND SALINITY. ADDITIONAL WORK IN THIS AREA IS NEEDED ALONG WITH THE NEED TO INTENSIFY THE DISSEMINATION OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO NEW MEXICO'S AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES. NM'S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR CONTRIBUTES ABOUT $2.5 BILLION ANNUALLY TO THE STATE ECONOMY WITH LIVESTOCK ACCOUNTING FOR 81% OF THE PRODUCTION VALUE. DROUGHTS HAVE CAUSED MAJOR ECONOMIC SETBACKS TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY WITH A COST OF ABOUT $100-250 MILLION PER EACH OF THE 12DROUGHT EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN NM SINCE 2000 THAT MOSTLY AFFECTED THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. THIS RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHED AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF DROUGHT CLIMATOLOGY BY PROVIDING DECISION-MAKERS WITH A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF DROUGHT IMPACTS MIGHT OCCUR WITH THE DIFFERENT DROUGHT SEVERITY LEVELS. THIS INFORMATION CAN HELP IN DEVELOPING DROUGHT RESPONSE AND RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. ADDITIONAL EFFORT IS NEEDED TO DISSEMINATE THIS INFORMATION TO THE APPROPRIATE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES. SOIL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY PROMINENT IN NEW MEXICO, WITH MANY DEGRADED FARMLANDS. AN INTEGRATED RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED TO  ADDRESS SOIL HEALTH ISSUES IN CROPPING SYSTEMS OF NEW MEXICO. TWO MAJOR WORKSHOPS (OVER 2000 PARTICIPANTS, 15 COUNTIES) WERE CONDUCTED IN THE PAST YEAR WITH PARTICIPANTS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE STATE. OVER 80% OF PARTICIPANTS INDICATED INCREASED KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO USE VARIOUS SOIL HEALTH PRACTICES AFTER THE TRAINING EVENTS. ABOUT 50% OF LAND MANAGERS HAVE INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT SOIL HEALTH MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR IMPROVING THEIR LAND. SOIL HEALTH AWARENESS CREATED BY THIS EXTENSION PROGRAM AND OTHER STATE ENTITIES LED TO THE PASSING OF THE HEALTHY SOIL ACT DURING THE NM LEGISLATIVE SESSION IN 2019. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL EFFORT IS NEEDED TO CONTINUE ADDRESSING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NM", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "de97a5f2-1275-d5ec-1246-554167802175-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLSNXXXXG004_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736021, "Award ID": "NI23SLSNXXXXG003", "Award Amount": 72135.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-22", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "SMITH-LEVER SPECIAL NEEDS ABSTRACT NDSU EXTENSION THE MISSION OF NDSU EXTENSION IS TO CREATE LEARNING PARTNERSHIPS THAT HELP ADULTS AND YOUTH ENHANCE THEIR LIVES AND COMMUNITIES. NDSU EXTENSION ACTIVITIES CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING CROP PRODUCTIVITY, ADAPTING NEW CROPS; ADAPTING CROPPING SYSTEMS, RESPONDING TO EVOLVING PEST ISSUES, IMPROVING SOIL MANAGEMENT; ASSISTING WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOFUELS AS SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SOURCES; AND TRAINING FAMILIES ON NUTRITION AND WELLNESS TO ADDRESS CHILDHOOD OBESITY. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON STATE IDENTIFIED NEEDS IN THE AREAS OF AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES; 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT; FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES; AND COMMUNITY, LEADERSHIP AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. NDSU EXTENSION CONTRIBUTES IN THESE AREAS BY PROVIDING TRANSFORMATIONAL EDUCATION AND CREATING/MAINTAINING PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE, REGION AND NATION. NDSU EXTENSION IS COMMITTED TO THE CREATION OF AN INCLUSIVE AND MULTICULTURAL ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES APPROPRIATELY ALL THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. EXTENSION INCORPORATES A RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION OF THE VALUES AND BENEFITS THAT DIVERSITY CONTRIBUTES TO OUR ORGANIZATION'S LIFE AND MISSION. NDSU EXTENSION PROVIDES EQUAL ACCESS AND SERVICE TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES, A CORE VALUES OF OUR WORK. OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREMIER LIFETIME EDUCATION NETWORK THAT HELPS NORTH DAKOTANS IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. AS THE ISSUES FACING THEM BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, NDSU EXTENSION WILL CONTINUE TO MEET PEOPLE'S NEEDS AS THEY ADAPT TO THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. PURPOSE - OVER 40% OF THE DAKOTA POPULATION IS RURAL AND HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON AGRICULTURE FOR ITS LIVELIHOOD. ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE LIVING IN THE DAKOTAS ARE EMPLOYED IN AGRICULTURE. HOWEVER, ISOLATED NATIVE AMERICAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES FACE GROWING FOOD SECURITY AND SOVEREIGNTY ISSUES RESULTING FROM HISTORIC AND ONGOING EXCLUSION AND FOOD DESERTS. DURING 2018-2020, 7.9% OF NORTH DAKOTA HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITIES. WHILE ISOLATION CAN POSE CHALLENGES FOR FOOD SECURITY, THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A STEADY INCREASE OF SMALL FARM LAND OWNERS WITHIN NORTH DAKOTA. LAND IN NORTH DAKOTA SMALL FARMS (1 TO 49 ACRES) HAS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 14% FROM 2007 TO 2017 (NASS, 2017 CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE). NDSU EXTENSION AGENTS ARE BEING CONTACTED BY BEGINNING AND CURRENT SMALL FARMERS DESIRING RESOURCES THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE AND RELEVANT TO THEIR OPERATIONS. THESE PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED TO SMALL FARM OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO THEIR INTEREST IN THE LANDSCAPE, NATURE AND RURAL LIFESTYLE. MANY HAVE A DESIRE TO TAKE PART IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THROUGH LOCAL FOODS AND VALUE-ADDED OPPORTUNITIES. ACTIVITIES - NDSU EXTENSION IS INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES AND PARTNERSHIPS TO ASSIST UNDERSERVED FARMERS AND RANCHERS. CURRENT MULTI-DISCIPLINARY EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO ASSIST INDIGENOUS FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND WELL AS PRODUCERS WITH LESS THAN 50 ACRES IN PRODUCTION. A TRIBAL LIAISON WAS APPOINTED IN 2020 FOR AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS (TO INCLUDE NDSU EXTENSION), WITH THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH NORTH DAKOTA TRIBAL COLLEGES AND RESERVATION COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE, AND ULTIMATELY WORKING TOGETHER ON AGRICULTURAL MATTERS FACING RURAL FARMERS AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE. TRIBAL COLLEGE PARTNERS AND INDIGENOUS PRODUCERS ARE ENGAGED AND CONNECTED WITH NDSU EXTENSION THROUGH THE TRIBAL LIAISON AS WELL AS LOCAL EXTENSION AGENTS, WORKING TO ADDRESS FOOD SECURITY AND SOVEREIGNTY ISSUES THROUGH INCREASED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. NUETA HIDATSA SAHNISH COLLEGE (NHSC) IS ONE OF FIVE 1994 LAND-GRANT TRIBAL COLLEGES IN NORTH DAKOTA. AS A LAND-GRANT, NHSC PROVIDES AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND EXTENSION SERVICES TO THE MANDAN HIDATSA ARIKARA NATION, LOCAL STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. NHSC PARTNERS WITH NDSU EXTENSION TO EXPAND OUTREACH EFFORTS TO FORT BERTHOLD YOUTH AND AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE EDUCATION AND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE FOOD SECURITY, FOOD SOVEREIGNTY, CULTURAL PRESERVATION OF GARDENING TECHNIQUES, PRODUCTION OF LOCAL FOODS, RESEARCH IN JUNEBERRY PRODUCTION, AND REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE/SOIL HEALTH PRINCIPLES. NDSU EXTENSION PARTNERS WITH NHSC ON THESE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE PLACEMENT OF PERSONNEL WITH AN EMPHASIS ON YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, HORTICULTURE, NUTRITION AND LOCAL FOODS. ON THE TURTLE MOUNTAIN, SPIRIT LAKE, FORT BERTHOLD, AND STANDING ROCK RESERVATIONS IN NORTH DAKOTA, NDSU EXTENSION PERSONNEL PROVIDE RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND ASSISTANCE ON SOIL HEALTH, AND WEED AND PEST MANAGEMENT TO LOCAL FARMERS AND RANCHERS. PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL TRIBAL COLLEGES HELP INTEGRATE TRADITIONAL METHODS TAUGHT BY NDSU EXTENSION, SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICES, AND COUNTY WEED BOARDS, ALONGSIDE REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE AND SOIL HEALTH METHODS TAUGHT AT EACH TRIBAL COLLEGE, COMPLEMENTING SOME OF THE HOLISTIC HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS THAT HONOR THE LAND, ANIMALS, PLANTS AND LIFE CYCLES. A SMALL FARMS TEAM IS WORKING TO EXPAND THEIR WEBSITE PRESENCE TO HELP SMALL FARMERS CONNECT THEIR NEEDS WITH RESOURCES EXTENSION CURRENTLY HAVE THAT DIRECTLY APPLY TO PRODUCTION, CONSERVATION, SAFETY AND VALUE-ADDED PUBLICATIONS AND PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, THE TEAM IS EXPANDING EQUINE PROGRAMS AND POULTRY PRODUCTION PUBLICATIONS AND PRESENTATIONS, HELPING SMALL FARMERS INCREASE THEIR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND DIVERSITY THEIR PRACTICES. ACTIVITIES INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON LOCAL FOODS, HORTICULTURE, WEED MANAGEMENT, SOIL HEALTH, CONSERVATION TILLAGE AND NO-TILL PRACTICES, LIVESTOCK INTEGRATION, EFFICIENT MANURE AND NITROGEN MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, COVER CROPS, AND CROPPING SYSTEMS AND LIVESTOCK PRACTICES THAT ASSIST SMALL FARMERS AND INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY.

THE STATE REPRESENTS A MAJOR REGION OF RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES. ITS 365 MILLION ACRES INCLUDE THE NATION'S LARGEST OIL RESERVES, COAL DEPOSITS AND THE TWO LARGEST NATIONAL FORESTS. THE STATE ALSO CONTAINS AN ARRAY OF MINERAL DEPOSITS, INCLUDING GOLD, ZINC, BORON, MOLYBDENUM AND RARE EARTH MINERALS. ALASKA HAS A DIVERSE GEOGRAPHY THAT OFFERS SOILS FOR PRODUCTION OF FOOD, FIBER AND BIOMASS FUELS AS WELL AS A MULTITUDE OF RECREATIONAL AND TOURISM ACTIVITIES. WATERS SURROUNDING ALASKA'S SHORELINE AND RIPARIAN HABITATS CONTAIN LARGE STOCKS OF SALMON, COD, POLLOCK, HALIBUT, HERRING, CRAB AND SHRIMP THAT SUPPORT THRIVING COMMERCIAL, SPORT AND SUBSISTENCE FISHERIES. ALASKA'S NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY THOUGH RESOURCE INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY EXTRACTIVE IN NATURE. THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS A PREDOMINANT FORCE IN THE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF ANY TEACHING, RESEARCH, EXTENSION AND ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS (UAF) IN GENERAL AND COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE (CES) AND AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY EXPERIMENT STATION (AFES), IN PARTICULAR, MEET THE CHALLENGES OF INCREASING DEMANDS FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT ARE RELEVANT TO SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF ALASKA'S RESOURCES AND BRING COMMUNITY IDEAS TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE'S RESOURCES. ALASKA'S ECONOMY HAS BECOME DEPENDENT UPON REVENUES RELATED TO PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT. TO DIVERSIFY ITS ECONOMY, THE STATE IS MOVING TOWARD NONPETROLEUM NATURAL RESOURCES FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COST-EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE. THE PROGRAMS OF AFES AND CES PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN LINKING THE KNOWLEDGE GENERATED AT THE UNIVERSITY TO MEET THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF ALASKANS. CITIZENS ARE PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH ENGAGEMENT TO INFLUENCE FUTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PRIORITIES. CES DELIVERS THE LATEST RESEARCH FINDINGS, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES TO THE PUBLIC. WHILE ALASKA IMPORTS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FOODS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, GROWERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PRODUCE FRESH MARKET POTATOES, VEGETABLES AND HERBS; FORAGES, GRAINS AND MANUFACTURED LIVESTOCK FEEDS; CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDE BEDDING PLANTS, FLORALS, LANDSCAPE ORNAMENTALS AND SHORT SEASON VEGETABLES; AND A VARIETY OF NICHE MARKET CROPS. LIVESTOCK ENTERPRISES IN ALASKA ARE VARIED IN SIZE AND SPECIES OF ANIMAL IN PRODUCTION. PRODUCERS NEED INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO NORTHERN LATITUDES THAT WILL PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE AN ABUNDANT AND SAFE FOOD SUPPLY. AS THE POPULATION GROWS, MORE LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY PRODUCED FOOD WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE GREATER FOOD SECURITY. MANY ALASKANS LIVE  A SUBSISTENCE LIFESTYLE OR SUPPLEMENT THEIR DIETS WITH FISH AND GAME MEAT. ALASKA ALSO HAS A LARGE MILITARY POPULATION, AND MOST HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PRESERVED GAME MEAT OR FISH. ALASKA HAS ONE OF THE NATION'S HIGHEST RATES OF BOTULISM, SO IT IS IMPERATIVE TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED INFORMATION ON SAFE PRESERVATION OF DIETARY STAPLES. ALASKA ALSO HAS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING SENIOR POPULATIONS, WHO FACES THE CHALLENGE OF REMAINING ACTIVE AND HEALTHY IN A DEMANDING ENVIRONMENT. OTHER CONCERNS THAT DEFINE HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAMMING ARE THE HIGH RATES OF CHILD AND ADULT OBESITY AND DIABETES. INDOOR AIR QUALITY IS ALSO A PARTICULAR ALASKA CONCERN. HIGH ENERGY COSTS REMAIN A CRITICAL ISSUE, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL ALASKA, WHERE FUEL OIL RUNS $8 OR $9 A GALLON. RESEARCH AND OUTREACH WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON NEW AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY, WOOD AND BIOMASS AND ENERGY CONSERVATION. AFES WILL WORK TO PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION TO MANAGE RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY FOR ENHANCING THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE AT HIGH LATITUDES. WHILE FORESTERS, FARMERSAND LAND MANAGERS USE RESEARCH RESULTS, ALL ALASKANS BENEFIT FROM THE WISE USE OF LAND RESOURCES. RESEARCH PROJECTS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM PRODUCERS, INDUSTRIES, AND STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR INFORMATION ON PLANT, ANIMAL AND SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; AND STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND RESILIENCE. EXPERIMENT STATION RESEARCHERS WILL CONTINUE TO PUBLISH RESEARCH IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, BOOKS, AND IN EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETINS, CIRCULARS, NEWSLETTERS, RESEARCH PROGRESS REPORTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PUBLICATIONS. SCIENTISTS WILL ALSO DISSEMINATE THEIR FINDINGS THROUGH CONFERENCES, PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS, WORKSHOPS AND OTHER PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS LIKE WEBSITES AND BLOGS. THE MISSION OF CES IS TO USE RESEARCH-BASED KNOWLEDGE TO EDUCATE, ENGAGE AND SUPPORT THE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES OF ALASKA, CONNECTING THEM WITH THEIR UNIVERSITY. CES PROVIDES FACTUAL AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION WHILE BRINGING ALASKANS' ISSUES AND CHALLENGES TO THE UNIVERSITY. CES IS COMMITTED TO PROMOTING THE SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY OF INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDING PRACTICAL, NONFORMAL EDUCATION, INCLUDING CONFERENCES, WORKSHOPS AND COOPERATIVE WORK WITH COMMUNITY, REGIONAL AND TRIBAL PARTNERS. OUTREACH IS ALSO PROVIDED THROUGH NUMBERED PUBLICATIONS, FACULTY CONSULTATIONS, NEWSLETTERS, BLOGS AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS LIKE FACEBOOK PAGES, YOUTUBE CHANNELS AND TWITTER FEEDS. CES PRIORITIES ADDRESS NATIONAL PRIORITIES BY HELPING FAMILIES, YOUTH AND INDIVIDUALS BE PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY; ENHANCING WORKFORCE PREPARATION AND LIFE SKILLS; STRENGTHENING FOOD SAFETY AND SECURITY; AND FOSTERING GREATER ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. PROGRAMMING RESPECTS CULTURAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY AND IS RESPONSIVE TO EMERGING STAKEHOLDER NEEDS AND INTERESTS. PROGRAMS RESULT FROM CLIENT REQUESTS, VARIOUS REGIONAL AND SUBJECT MATTER ADVISORY GROUPS, SURVEYS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND WITH OTHER UNITS WITHIN UAF, THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA STATEWIDE SYSTEM, FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY ARE PLANNED TO CONTINUE. STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDE K-12 STUDENTS, HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS, RESEARCHERS, INDIVIDUALS, BUSINESSES, INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT, NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT ALASKA, THE CIRCUMPOLAR NORTH AND THE NATION. THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF CES AND AFES BRING THE UNIVERSITY TO ALASKANS WHILE BRINGING COMMUNITY CONCERNS AND ISSUES BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY. STATE-DEFINED CRITICAL ISSUE S LINK SPECIFIC PUBLIC NEEDS WITH OUR BROAD MISSION IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE CONCENTRATION OF RESOURCES (MONEY AND PEOPLE) THAT WILL PROMOTE HIGH-QUALITY WORK. CRITICAL ISSUES WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR FACULTY, STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS TO DIRECT CURRENT AND NEW PROGRAMS AND FIND OR RETAIN FACULTY EXPERTISE. THE NEXT SECTION OF THIS SUMMARY EXPLAINS THE RATIONALE DRIVING A FIVE-YEAR FOCUS ON FOUR CRITICAL ISSUES: AGRICULTURE <(>&<)> FOOD SECURITY; NATURAL RESOURCES, ECOSYSTEMS <(>&<)> SUSTAINABLE ENERGY; HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES <(>&<)> COMMUNITIES; AND 4-H <(>&<)> YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT LISTED SEPARATELY, AS IT AFFECTS ALL THE PROGRAM AREAS. AGRICULTURE <(>&<)> FOOD SECURITY: ALASKA IMPORTS OVER 90 PERCENT OF FOODS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CONSUMED IN THE STATE. GROWERS' PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY FOR IN-STATE CONSUMPTION AND USE, INCLUDING FRESH MARKET POTATOES, FORAGES, GRAINS AND OTHER LIVESTOCK FEEDS, GREENHOUSE FLOWERS AND VEGETABLES AND A VARIETY OF \"NICHE MARKET\" CROPS AND PRODUCTS. COMMERCIAL HORTICULTURE INCLUDES ORNAMENTALS, GREENHOUSE OPERATIONS, TURF MANAGEMENT, LAWN MAINTENANCE AND SOD PRODUCTION. PROPER KNOWLEDGE AND PLANNING OF SOIL-DISTURBING ACTIVITIES CAN PREVENT MAJOR IMPACTS ON OTHER RESOURCES. ANIMAL ENTERPRISES IN ALASKA INCLUDE DAIRY, BEEF, SWINE, REINDEER, POULTRY AND NONTRADITIONAL LIVESTOCK SUCH AS MUSKOX, ELK AND BISON. AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND OUTREACH WILL ADDRESS AR EAS OF ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, HOME ANIMAL PRODUCTION, AGRONOMIC CROPS INCLUDING OIL SEEDS AND COVER CROPS, AND HOME AND COMMERCIAL VEGETABLE PRODUCTION. AGRICULTURAL SOILS, FERTILIZER AND COMPOST RESEARCH AND OUTREACH ARE ALSO PART OF THIS PROGRAM AREA. OUR STATEWIDE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) EDUCATION PROGRAM HAS OPERATED SINCE 1981 ASSISTING INDIVIDUALS TO UNDERSTAND INVASIVE PESTS AND CONTROL OPTIONS. AGRICULTURE OUTREACH INCLUDES THE PRIMARY AREAS OF ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HEALTH, HORTICULTURE, SOIL SCIENCE AND AGROFORESTRY. AS ALASKA EXPANDS ITS IN-STATE CONSUMPTION AND EXPORT MARKETS, PRODUCERS WILL REQUIRE INCREASING ACCESS TO RESEARCH-DERIVED INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO NORTHERN LATITUDE ENVIRONMENTS AND KNOWLEDGE APPLIED FROM RESEARCH IN OTHER STATES. NATURAL RESOURCES, ECOSYSTEMS <(>&<)> SUSTAINABLE ENERGY: COMMUNITIES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON ALASKA'S NATURAL RESOURCES FOR VIABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. POLICIES TO SUSTAIN THISGROWTH THAT MIRROR SOCIOLOGICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WILL BE CRITICAL. MAJOR ALASKA RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE NOW CENTERED IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRIES. HEADQUARTERS FOR THESE INDUSTRIES ARE LOCATED IN THE URBAN CENTERS WHERE THERE IS ACCESS TO VARIOUS TRANSPORTATION AND ADVANCED COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, URBAN COMMUNITIES LACK INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENGAGE IN VALUE-ADDED ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD ENHANCE DEVELOPMENT OF NONPETROLEUM INDUSTRY. ADDITIONALLY, THESE EFFORTS SHOULD PROVIDE UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN RURAL AREAS REAL OPTIONS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. OUTREACH WILL ADDRESS STAKEHOLDER NEEDS FOR UNBIASED, SCIENCE-BASED INFORMATION ABOUT NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN FORESTRY, MINING, WATER, RECREATION AND ALTERNATIVE, SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SOURCES. ALASKA'S FOREST AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCE POTENTIAL FOR BIOENERGY PRODUCTION IS IMMENSE BUT REQUIRES MORE RESEARCH. THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF ALASKA'S FORESTS IS UNDER-REALIZED IN TIMBER AND NONTIMBER PRODUCTS. THE FOREST ECOSYSTEM AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS CAN PLAY A ROLE IN DIVERSIFYING THE ECONOMY OF ALASKA. CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH AND SURVIVAL OF RESOURCE BIODIVERSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CENTRAL ISSUE IN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN ALASKA AND ELSEWHERE. AS ENERGY CONTINUES TO BECOME A GROWING CONCERN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THE BOREAL FOREST HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS NECESSARY FOR FUEL ALTERNATIVES TO PETROLEUM AND COAL. HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES <(>&<)> COMMUNITIES: CONCERNS FOR ALASKANS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF OBESITY AND RECURRING FOOD SAFETY ISSUES SUCH AS BOTULISM. THE STATE RECORDS FREQUENT EARTHQUAKES, WHICH UNDERSCORES A NEED FOR EMERGENCY PREPARATION AS WELL AS PERIODIC RADON TESTING RELATED TO GROUND SHIFTS. FOOD SAFETY PROGRAMMING WILL ENCOMPASS FOOD PRESERVATION, SAFETY, PREPARATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION WILL UTILIZE VARIOUS RESOURCES AND STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT ALL TYPES OF FOODS, INCLUDING INDIGENOUS FOODS, ARE PROPERLY STORED, PREPARED AND PRESERVED SO THAT FOOD IS SAFE FOR CONSUMPTION. HOME AND ENERGY EXTENSION PROGRAMMING ADDRESSES INDOOR AIR QUALITY, HOME MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, ENERGY USE AND CONSERVATION. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IMPACTS SUCH AREAS AS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES RESPONDING TO NATURAL AND MAN-MADE DISASTERS. NUTRITION OUTREACH WILL ADDRESS CHILDHOOD OBESITY WITH NUTRITION EDUCATION IN AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS IN COMMUNITY VENUES AS WELL AS COOKING PROGRAMS THAT EMPHASIZE PREPARING HEALTHY FOODS. TRAINING IS CONDUCTED WITH YOUTH, TEACHERS, 4-H LEADERS, YOUTH GROUP ORGANIZERS, PARENTS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO PROVIDE TECHNIQUES FOR WORKING DIRECTLY WITH YOUTH IN THE AREA OF NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. 4-H <(>&<)> YOUTH DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YOUTH NEED SUSTAINED, HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITH ADULTS IN ORDER TO THRIVE. CES WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT THROUGH EDUCATION WITH A FOCUS ON LEADERSHIP SKILLS, USING THE 4-H MISSIONMAND ATES OF SCIENCE, CITIZENSHIP AND HEALTHY LIVING. ORGANIZED 4-H CLUBS, SCHOOL ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS, AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITIES AND SUMMER CAMPS WILL CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT GOALS. THE FOCUS OF ALASKA'S 4-H PROGRAM IS SUPPORTING THE HEALTHY MATURATION OF YOUTH FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADULTHOOD. TRAINING THROUGHOUT THE STATE, PROMOTING LIFE SKILLS AND USING THE 4-H MODEL OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, WILL BE THE FOUNDATION OF ALL YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING. DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THE STATE'S APPROPRIATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.

AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES: AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY UTAH HAS OVER 18,000 FARMS AND RANCHES SPANNING 11 MILLION ACRES, WHICH GENERATE MORE THAN $21 BILLION IN TOTAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT). WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT UTAH BECOMES MORE URBANIZED EACH YEAR, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO PLAY A VITAL PART IN OUR STATE. AS THE POPULATION OF UTAH AND THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO GROW, FOOD PRODUCTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY (USU) EXTENSION HAS LED THE WAY FOR 105 YEARS IN PROVIDING NON-BIASED, RESEARCH-BASED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PRODUCERS AND THE UTAH AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. USU EXTENSION HAS NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FACULTY WITH EXPERTISE IN ALL AREAS OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION AND SCIENCE. OUR ON-CAMPUS AND COUNTY FACULTY CONDUCT CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH THAT IS DISSEMINATED TO PRODUCERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH METHODS SUCH AS FIELD DAYS, WORKSHOPS, PRINTED AND ONLINE PUBLICATIONS, CLASSES, ONLINE COURSES, AND SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS. EXTENSION CONTINUES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE WHILE EVOLVING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DEVELOPING AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES. AS WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON PERSISTENT AND EMERGING NEEDS, WE RECOGNIZE UTAH IS THE SECOND DRIEST STATE IN THE NATION, SO IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY, WATER CONSERVATION, AND IMPROVED WATER-EFFICIENT CROP VARIETIES CONTINUE TO BE FOCUS AREAS FOR OUR FACULTY AND RESEARCHERS. WITH URBAN AND SMALL FARMS BECOMING MORE POPULAR, EXTENSION FACULTY ARE WORKING WITH PRODUCERS TO FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO PRODUCE FOOD ON MINIMAL ACREAGE. THE LONG-TERM GOALS OF THE AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCE (AG/NR) PROGRAM ARE TO (A) INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY OF UTAH AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS, AND (B) PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE USE THROUGH RELEVANT EDUCATION ON CONSERVATION PRACTICES. FACULTY INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING CROP AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION, RANGELAND MANAGEMENT, FORESTRY, AND AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES THE WESTERN U.S. CONTAINS STATES WITH VAST TRACTS OF PUBLIC LAND SURROUNDING SMALLER AREAS THAT ARE PRIVATELY OWNED, MOSTLY ADJACENT TO WATER. THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASE OF ANY ECONOMY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMIC AND AESTHETIC ENVIRONMENTS FOR THAT AREA. CHANGES IN THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASE BRING VARIATION IN THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE. CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING NATURAL RESOURCE CHARACTERISTICS ARE FOUND IN SOILS, WATER, RANGE, FOREST, ANIMALS, AND AIR RESOURCES. THE PROPER AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS A PRIMARY CONCERN, PARTICULARLY FOR ENVIRONMENTS AS VARIED AND UNIQUE AS IN THE WEST. THIS CRITICAL ISSUE INVOLVES IMPROVING DECISION-MAKING RELATIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IN AN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND BIOLOGICAL SENSE. USU EXTENSION ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES THROUGH THE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM. THE GOAL OF THIS EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE NON-FORMAL EDUCATION TO RESIDENTS, STAKEHOLDERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE, FACILITATE, AND STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE USE IN UTAH. THIS PROJECT PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON FOREST MANAGEMENT, WATER CONSERVATION, AND STEWARDSHIP OF PUBLIC LANDS. THE PROJECT TARGETS ADULTS AND YOUTH, AND THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO (A) EQUIP RESIDENTS WITH THE COMPETENCY TO EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE IN NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION, AND (B) FACILITATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS TO STRENGTHEN NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND ENABLE SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE. FACULTY INVOLVED IN THE SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING WATER MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES, AND TOURISM. ALL RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, DEMONSTRATIONS, CONFERENCES, AND FIELD VISITS ON TOPICS RELATED TO WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY, CLIMATE SCIENCE, BIOMASS, PERMACULTURE, OUTDOOR RECREATION, AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION. FOOD SAFETY WITHA LARGE VARIETY OF FOOD PRODUCTS MOVING THROUGH COMPLEX DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, FOOD SAFETY IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR PRODUCERS, PR OCESSORS, DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, AND THE FINAL CONSUMER. FOODBORNE ILLNESS IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH, CLAIMING THE LIVES OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS; THE ELDERLY, YOUNG, PREGNANT WOMEN, PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRED IMMUNE FUNCTION, AND THE CHRONICALLY ILL. IMPROPER FOOD HANDLING AND PREPARATION OF FOOD IN FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE HOME CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD-BORNE ILLNESSES. THE PUBLIC FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION AIMS TO PROVIDE RELEVANT RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATION TO UTAH RESIDENTS ON BEST PRACTICES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FOOD CONTAMINATION AND FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. THE MAJOR FOCUS AREAS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE FOOD PRESERVATION TECHNIQUES AND HOUSEHOLD FOOD STORAGE. THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE PUBLIC FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION PROGRAM ARE TO (A) REDUCE THE OCCURRENCES OF FOODBORNE ILLNESSES IN UTAH THROUGH RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATION ON FOODSAFETY PRACTICES IN HOUSEHOLDS, AND (B) TO REDUCE FOOD CONTAMINATION IN THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN BY PROVIDING RELEVANT EDUCATION ON BEST PRACTICES TO PROCESSORS AND PRODUCERS. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN FOOD SAFETY INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS, CONSULTATIONS, AND (VIRTUAL AND FACE-TO-FACE) DEMONSTRATIONS TARGETED AT RESIDENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES ON FOOD PRESERVATION, CANNING, PRESSURE TESTING, FOOD PRODUCT TESTING, AND FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. NUTRITION AND HEALTH THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE NUTRITION INFORMATION AND EDUCATION TO THE PUBLIC TO ENABLE CONSUMERS TO MAKE WISE DIETARY CHOICES. AS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIET, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, AND DISEASE PREVENTION BECOME CLEARER, THE PROMOTION OF HEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS AND LIFESTYLES FOR BOTH YOUTH AND ADULTS HAS RECEIVED INCREASED ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. WITH HIGH LEVELS OF OBESITY, CHRONIC DISEASE, AND POOR DIETARY HABITS, THERE IS A NEED FOR NON-FORMAL NUTRITION EDUCATION THAT ADDRESSES INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY HEALTH AND WELLNESS. THE PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION SEEKS TO DECREASE THE INCIDENCES OF CHRONIC DISEASES AND OTHER NUTRITION-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES AMONG RESIDENTS THROUGH NON-FORMAL NUTRITION EDUCATION. THE PRIORITIES FOR THIS PROGRAM ARE TO EXPAND NUTRITIONAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, AND TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETARY HABITS. THEREFORE, THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE THE PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM ARE TO (A) EMPOWER RESIDENTS TO MAKE HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES AND IMPROVE THEIR NUTRITIONAL INTAKE, AND (B) REDUCE THE ECONOMIC COST OF CHRONIC DISEASES IN UTAH THROUGH ONGOING NUTRITION EDUCATION TO YOUTH AND ADULTS. FACULTY INVOLVED IN PUBLIC NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCTS RESEARCH ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING N UTRITION, OBESITY, CHRONIC DISEASES, AND FOOD SCIENCE. RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN NUTRITION AND HEALTH INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND CONSULTATIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO CHRONIC DISEASES, NUTRITION EDUCATION, HEALTHY AND AFFORDABLE RECIPES, DIET BEHAVIOR CHANGES, AND YOUTH NUTRITION. COMMUNITY RESILIENCE UTAH CONSISTS OF MANY RURAL COUNTIES SPREAD OUT OVER VAST AREAS OF LAND, AND ONLY A FEW URBAN COUNTIES IN CENTRALIZED LOCATIONS. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN INCREASING DISPARITY IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS IN RURAL COUNTIES. THE MAJORITY OF CURRENT AND NEW JOBS ARE LOCATED ALONG THE URBAN COUNTIES IN THE WASATCH FRONT, INCLUDING JOBS IN THE GROWING TECHNOLOGY SECTOR IN UTAH'S \"SILICON SLOPES.\" IN CONTRAST, RURAL RESIDENTS STRUGGLE TO FIND WELL-PAYING AND STABLE WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ARE OFTEN FACED WITH THE DECISION TO RELOCATE TO URBAN CENTERS. THIS EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC DEPRESSION IN RURAL COUNTIES SINCE RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION LEADS TO LOW PRODUCTIVITY IN THESE COUNTIES. THERE IS A NEED TO SUPPORT RURAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH COMMUNITY AND CAPACITY-BUILDING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION TO ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS, INDIVIDUALS IN RURAL COUNTIES SUFFER FROM RELATIVELY HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. THE RATES OF OPIOID OVERDOSES IN RURAL UTAH HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. UTAH HAD EIGHT (8) OUT OF 10 ADULT OVERDOSE DEATHS EACH WEEK DUE TO OPIOIDS IN 2019, AND HALF OF THOSE WERE SPECIFICALLY DUE TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS (UTAH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH [UDOH] INDICATOR-BASED SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH [IBIS], 2021). IN 2020, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CREATED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING INCREASES IN OPIOID-RELATED DEATHS DUE TO FENTANYL. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AT USU EXTENSION IS TO STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES ACROSS UTAH THROUGH FACILITATED COMMUNITY-FOCUSED COALITIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS, ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION, AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. THE DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIESPROGRAM ARE TO (A) CONNECT RURAL COMMUNITIES TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN URBAN CENTERS THROUGH INNOVATIVE WORKPLACE PRACTICES (E.G., REMOTE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS), AND (B) FACILITATE EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS, AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COALITIONS TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS IN RURAL COUNTIES. MAJOR ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN COMMUNITY RESILIENCE INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND INTERVENTIONS ON TOPICS RELATED TO RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, RURAL EMPLOYMENT, REMOTE WORKING, BUILDING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COALITIONS, AND TRIBAL INITIATIVES. INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT UTAH IS IN THE TOP 5 U.S. STATES WITH BANKRUPTCY, AND THERE IS A NEED FOR OUTREACH EDUCATION TO FACILITATE IMPROVED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. BECAUSE OF UTAH'S TYPICALLY LARGER FAMILY SIZE, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME AVAILABLE FOR BASIC FAMILY NEEDS SLIPS BELOW THE MEAN FOR THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. UTAH FAMILIES ALREADY FACE HIGH DEBT LOADS LEADING TOBANKRUPTCY, LOW SAVINGS, AND A LACK OF LIQUID ASSETS. HENCE, THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PLANNED EXTENSION PROGRAM IS TO ENHANCE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (FRM). FRM, WHICH RELATES TO FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, ALSO TIES TO OTHER ASPECTS OF FAMILY HEALTH, SUCH AS HEALTHY MARITAL AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. AS A BROAD PROGRAM AREA, THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES YOUTH, ADULTS, AND FAMILIES IN UTAH. DESIRED LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE TO; (A) STRENGTHEN FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, AND (B) IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. FACULTY INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM ACTIVELY CONDUCT RESEARCH IN FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING, RELATIONSHIPS, AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THE RESEARCH IS INCORPORATED INTO EXTENSION ACTIVITIES TO INFORM BEST PRACTICES, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT.

THE KSRE NETWORK INCLUDES OFFICES IN ALL 105 COUNTIES, ALONG WITH FOUR REGIONAL EXTENSION OFFICES, FIVE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENCOMPASS VARIABILITY IN CLIMATE AND SOILS, FOUR SATELLITE UNITS, FOUR AGRONOMY EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND FOUR HORTICULTURE CENTERS AND EXPERIMENT FIELDS. IN ADDITION, KSRE FUNDS RESEARCH PROJECTS IN 20 DEPARTMENTS ACROSS FIVE COLLEGES. A UNIQUE FEATURE WITHIN THE K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION ORGANIZATION IS THE CLOSE ALIGNMENT OF RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. IN 1996, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION WAS FORMED BY ALIGNING THE KANSAS AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (KAES) AND THE KANSAS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE. THE STRATEGIC INTENT OF THIS ALIGNMENT WAS TO ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCY AND SYNERGY BETWEEN DISCOVERY AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. ONE ANCILLARY BENEFIT OF THIS ALIGNMENT IS THAT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO RAPID EXTENSION PROGRAMMING AND APPLICATION IN THE FIELD. THIS ALIGNMENT ALSO ALLOWS MORE FLUID COMPLIANCE WITH MULTI-STATE AND INTEGRATED COMPONENTS OF AREERA. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSING ITS EFFORTS ON FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES (CRITICAL ISSUES) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT ALL KANSANS: GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES, HEALTH, DEVELOPING TOMORROWS LEADERS, AND COMMUNITY VITALITY. THESE GRAND CHALLENGES WERE DETERMINED THROUGH A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND DEFINE AREAS OF EMPHASIS FOR AGENTS, SPECIALISTS, AND RESEARCHERS. EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS AT THE LOCAL, REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL WORK TO DEVELOP REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE SIGNATURE PROGRAMS ALONG WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS MEMBERS THROUGH 11 PROGRAM FOCUS TEAMS ADULT DEVELOPMENT AND AGING; COMMUNITY VITALITY; CROP PRODUCTION; FAMILY AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT; FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; FARM MANAGEMENT; HORTICULTURE; LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; NATURAL RESOURCES; NUTRITION, FOOD SAFETY AND HEALTH; AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, TWO TRANSDISCIPLINARY TEAMS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS COMPLEX ISSUES TO KANSANS - LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS AND STRESS AND RESILIENCY. THE WORK OF THESE TEAMS FALLS WITHIN THE OVERALL UMBRELLA OF THE FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CANNOT SOLVE THESE CHALLENGES ALONE. KSRES STATEWIDE PRESENCE LENDS ITSELF TO COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH ORGANIZATIONS, PRIVATE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY, LOCAL GROUPS, STATE AND FEDERAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES. QUALITY FACULTY DRAW BUSINESSES AND FUNDING TO K-STATE AND TO KANSAS INCLUDING: - K-STATE IS THE ONLY UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD WITH ACCESS TO A FULL CONTINUUM OF BIOSECURITY LABORATORIES LOCATED ON OR ADJACENT TO CAMPUS. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE WILL PROVIDE PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSTICS, RESEARCH, SURVEILLANCE, AND TRAINING IN DISEASE VECTOR BIOLOGY. THE LABORATORIES WILL OFFER EMERGENCY RAPID TESTING AND MANUFACTURING TO PROTECT THE NATIONS ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SUPPLY DURING A CRISIS. - KANSAS PRIDE IS DEDICATED TO SERVING COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND VOLUNTEERS IN MAKING THEIR COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK. THE KANSAS PRIDE PROGRAM IS A PARTNERSHIP OF K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION, THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, KANSAS MASONS AND KANSAS PRIDE, INC. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, LOCAL COMMUNITIES IDENTIFY WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO PRESERVE, CREATE, OR IMPROVE FOR THEIR FUTURE. THEN, WORKING WITH THE RESOURCES OF K-STATE RESEARCH <(>&<)> EXTENSION AND THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS PULL TOGETHER TO CREATE THEIR IDEAL COMMUNITY FUTURE. - EXTENSIONS RESEARCH CENTERS, EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND HIGHLY SKILLED SCIENTISTS AND STAFF, COMBINED WITH THE CLIMATE AND SOIL VARIABILITY ACROSS THE STATE, PROVIDE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND CORPORATE AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. - FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES IS A PARTNER OF THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT FOR AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE EDUCATION TO MEDICARE ELIGIBLE KANSANS. APPROXIMATELY 1/3 OF THE CONTACTS OF THOSE SERVED ARE VULNERABLE BENEFICIARIES WITH INCOMES BELOW 150% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL. - KANSAS 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WAS AWARDED A CONTRACT BY THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR $4.2 MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE SUMMERS TO PROVIDE HANDS-ON, PROJECT-BASED 4-H SUMMER PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS COVID-19-RELATED LEARNING LOSS IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUILDING UPON THE LONG RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LEVERAGING THE STATES LARGEST YOUTH DEVELOPMENT NETWORK REACHING ALL 105 COUNTIES, KANSAS 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WILL USE SUMMER ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF YOUTH AS A PART OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF PLAN. - K-SANGE AND DIVERSITY TO THE KSRE TEAM AND PROVIDE CULTURAL COMPETENCY AWARENESS AND SKILLS THAT THEY CAN PRACTICALLY APPLY IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY WORK. OTHER EFFORTS INCLUDE: - THE MULTICULTURAL UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM TARGETS UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS WITH THE GOAL TO ESTABLISH NETWORKING RELATIONSHIPS BACK TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOME INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS K-STATE FACULTY. THIS PROGRAM HAS A SPECIFIC GOAL OF GROWING THE MINORITY POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS WITHIN GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND ACROSS OTHER PARTNER COLLEGES REPRESENTED WITHIN K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. - LOCAL UNIT EXTENSION COUNCIL MEMBERS REVIEW PARITY STATISTICS ANNUALLY AND SPEND TIME DETERMINING STRATEGIC EFFORTS NECESSARY TO REACH UNDERSERVED AND AT-RISK AUDIENCES. - K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN AND SECURING SERVICES THROUGH LANGUAGE LINE SERVICES TO BRING GREATER ACCESS TO LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT AUDIENCES. - THIS FALL, A NEW COMMUNITY LIAISON WILL BE ON STAFF TO HELP LINK KSRE'S RESOURCES TO THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN NORTHEAST KANSAS. GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS AS THE STATE'S LARGEST EMPLOYER, AGRICULTURE DRIVES THE KANSAS ECONOMY. IN 2020, THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTED $70.3 BILLION TO THE KANSAS ECONOMY. AGRICULTURE IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE, WITH 250,058 PEOPLE ACCOUNTING FOR 13 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE. WE ARE IMPROVING FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS TO FEED THE WORLD'S GROWING POPULATION, WHICH WILL ECONOMICALLY BENEFIT KANSAS. TO FEED AND SUSTAIN A GROWING POPULATION, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRACTICES TO HELP FARMERS, RANCHERS, AND AGRIBUSINESSES IMPROVE PROFITABILITY, EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY FOR KANSAS, OUR NATION, AND THE WORLD THROUGH CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH IN AREAS SUCH AS GENETICS, DISEASE PREVENTION, FOOD SECURITY AND FARM BILL EDUCATION.

CHEYENNE, THE CAPITAL AND LARGEST CITY, HAS A POPULATION OF 65,132. THE STATE IS DIVIDED INTO 23 COUNTIES AND THE WIND RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION. FIFTY-THREE PERCENT OF LAND IN WYOMING IS OWNED BY THE FEDERAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT. MOST OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY IS CONCENTRATED IN THREE SECTORS: AGRICULTURE, MINERALS, AND TOURISM. THE STATE IS ALSO A MAJOR PRODUCER OF BEEF, SHEEP, WOOL, WIND ENERGY, COAL, AND NATURAL GAS. THE UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING IS THE ONLY UNIVERSITY IN THE STATE. THE UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING EXTENSION (UWE) WILL ENHANCE CAPACITY FOR SUCCESS AND THE RESILIENCY OF WYOMING PEOPLE, COMMUNITIES, ORGAN IZATIONS, AND BUSINESSES THROUGH EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FUNDED IN PART THROUGH THE SMITH LEVER 3(B) AND 3(C) CAPACITY GRANT. A TEAM-BASED APPROACH TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM LEADERSHIP REVOLVES AROUND THREE FOCUS AREAS, WHICH ASSESS THE NEEDS OF WYOMING RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITIES AND THEN PRIORITIZE AND DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AROUND THOSE NEEDS. THE THREE FOCUS AREAS ARE: AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES, COMMUNITY VITALITY AND HEALTH, AND 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. UWE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ORGANIZATIONS AS PARTNERS AND COLLABORATORS IN EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS TO BUILD CAPACITY IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT WYOMING. CRITICAL ISSUE: COMMUNITIES, FAMILIES AND YOUTH (FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS) DESCRIPTION: WYOMING NEEDS STRONG, DYNAMIC, SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND VOLUNTARY SECTORS. SUCH COMMUNITIES DEPEND UPON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT LEADERSHIP ROLES IN MUNICIPALITY AND/OR COUNTY GOVERNMENT AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO TACKLE HUMAN AND COMMUNITY ISSUES, AND FAMILIES WHO ARE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND MANAGE THEIR BASIC NEEDS TO THRIVE. FURTHERMORE, WYOMING, THE NATION, AND THE WORLD NEED YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SKILLS TO BE RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS AND CHANGE AGENTS FOR THE FUTURE. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AROUND KEY COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INTERESTS LIKE LEADERSHIP, MANAGEMENT AND POLICY CHALLENGES, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, CIVIC ENGAGEMENT/VOLUNTEERISM, ECONOMIC VALUATION, AND INTEGRATED DECISION-MAKING INFLUENCE THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY AT ALL LEVELS. THE FINANCIAL VITALITY OF FAMILIES IS OFTEN TIED TO THE BOOM-AND-BUST CYCLE OF ENERGY SECTORS ACROSS WYOMING. PERSONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SKILLS ARE ESSENTIAL TO SURVIVING AND THRIVING THE ECONOMIC SWINGS ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY PRODUCTION. WYOMING IS ALSO A RURAL AGRICULTURAL STATE AND EFFECTIVE GENERATIONAL TRANSITION OF MANAGEMENT IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF WYOMING AGRICULTURE. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS CAN ENSURE THAT THE NEXT GENERATION HAS ACCESS TO THE TOOLS, KNOWLEDGE, AND RESOURCES NEEDED FOR VIABLE AND PROGRESSIVE WYOMING FARMS AND RANCHES. YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS CREATE WAYS TO ENGAGEYOUTH WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES, SCHOOLS, ORGANIZATIONS, PEER GROUPS, AND FAMILIES THROUGH OPPORTUNITIES THAT BUILD LEADERSHIP STRENGTHS AND DEVELOP RESILIENCY. IN 4-H, ADULT VOLUNTEERS PARTNER WITH UWE TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR YOUTH AND TRAINED VOLUNTEERS ARE ESSENTIAL IN SUPPORTING POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES. UWE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES, FAMILIES AND YOUTH: CIVIC HEALTH - COMMUNITY MEMBERS OFTEN DESIRE TO PURSUE A GOAL OR VISION YET STRUGGLE TO EFFECTIVELY WORK TOGETHER TO ACCOMPLISH THE OUTCOME, OR DO NOT HAVE THE SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE, OR SELF-AWARENESS TO MOVE FORWARD. COLLABORATION TO MOTIVATE ACTION, DEVELOP SKILLS AND FACILITATE THE PROCESSES THAT ADDRESS LOCAL AND REGIONAL NEEDS AND TO BUILD REGIONAL ECONOMIES WILL INCREASE THE CIVIC PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT IN AMERICAN LIFE. COMMUNITY ECONOMIC VITALITY - THE OVERALL GOAL OF UW EXTENSION ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAMING IS TO IMPROVE THE VIBRANCY OF WYOMING'S E CONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL COMMUNITY-BASED EFFORTS WILL BE FACILITATED TO IMPROVE THE ECOSYSTEM FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURES TO DEVELOP, INCLUDING THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS AND THE ROLE OF INDIVIDUALS, HOUSEHOLDS, BUSINESSES, COMMUNITIES, AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE IN BUILDING AND MAINTAINING A STRONG ECONOMY; DEVELOP AND SUPPORT PROGRAMMING IN YO UTH ENTREPRENEURSHIP; AND BUILD SKILLS IN VENTURE MANAGEMENT. INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT - THE OVERALL GOAL OF FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IS TO INCREASE WYOMING RESIDENTS' CAPACITY TO ADDRESS CONSUMER AND HOUSEHOLD ECONOMIC ISSUES BY OFFERING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON LIFELONG FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DECISION-MAKING SKILLS. VOLUNTEER SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT - PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR 4-H VOLUNTEERS THAT SUPPORT THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY TO SERVE IN THE VARIOUS ROLES AVAILABLE TO THEM IN OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING. TEEN PROGRAMMING AND ENGAGEMENT - INTENTIONALLY FRAME ALL 4-H LEARNING EXPERIENCES FROM A POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE TO SUPPORT PYD OUTCOMES. THIS INCLUDES INVOLVING TEENS IN PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, AND EVALUATING 4-H LEARNING EXPERIENCES. THE CREATION OF \"SEATS\" FOR YOUTH ON 4-H COMMITTEES HISTORICALLY MADE UP ONLY OF ADULTS IS ONE ASPECT OF THIS GOAL. YOUTH WILL BE INCLUDED MORE IN MANY ASPECTS OF EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES PROVIDED BUT ALSO THROUGH MORE LIFE AND LEADERSHIP SKILL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEENS. CRITICAL ISSUE: COMMUNITY SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROSPERITY (FOCUS ON BUSINESSES) DESCRIPTION: WYOMING'S ECONOMY IS VULNERABLE BECAUSE OF ITS HISTORICAL ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON AGRICULTURE AND EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES, COUPLED WITH ITS SPARSE POPULATION. SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROSPERITY CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, COMMUNITIES, AND RANCH/FARM OPERATIONS. IMPACT ANALYSIS OF NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDS AND ALTERNATIVE LAND USES; CROP DIVERSIFICATION, INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTWITH FEASIBLE PRODUCTION OPTIONS FOR WYOMING, NICHE MARKETING AND AGRICULTURAL TRADE IN THE NEW GLOBAL MARKET ENVIRONMENT; RANCH AND FARM MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, INNOVATIVE PLANNING TOOLS FOR LIVESTOCK AND CROP ENTERPRISES, AND EVALUATION OF VARIOUS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE EXAMPLES OF RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM PRIORITIES THAT WILL BRING ECONOMIC VALUE AND SUSTAINABILITY TO WYOMING. KNOWLEDGE OF DISASTER RESOURCES, DEVELOPMENT OF DISASTER PLANS, AND EFFECTIVE DECISION-MAKING STRATEGIES WILL ALSO PREPARE INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL DISASTERS AND ENGAGE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES TO REDUCE THEIR VULNERABILITY TO DISASTERS. UWE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROSPERITY: LIVESTOCK HEALTH AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE - WYOMING LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS AND OWNERS MUST CONSTANTLY MANAGE HERD/FLOCK HEALTH AND DISEASE ISSUES. FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE HEALTH AND DISEASE CONCERNS COULD BE DEVASTATING TO THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND WELL-BEING OF ALL WYOMING LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS. UWE WILL PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO DECREASE LIVESTOCK DEATH AND ECONOMIC LOSSES AS WELL AS SUPPORT PRODUCERS TO RECEIVE \"BEST PRACTICE\" CERTIFICATIONS FOR THEIR OPERATION. AN EXAMPLE OF A BEST PRACTICE CERTIFICATION IS THE BEEF QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. MAINTAINING VIABLE AND PROGRESSIVE AG-OPERATIONS - EFFECTIVE GENERATIONAL TRANSITION OF MANAGEMENT IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF WYOMI NG AGRICULTURE. NOT ONLY MUST WE ENSURE THAT THIS TRANSITION HAPPENS, BUT WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT THE NEXT GENERATION HAS ACCESS TO THE TOOLS, KNOWLEDGE, AND RESOURCES NEEDED FOR SUCCESS. UWE WILL WORK WITH PRODUCERS TO INCREASE DIVERSIFICATION OF THEIR ENTERPRISE(S); ENCOURAGE NEW MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT ENHANCE SUSTAINABILITY; AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND TOOLS TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER MANAGEMENT OF AG OPERATIONS TO A DIFFERENT GENERATION. CROP DIVERSITY - DIVERSIFICATION OF CROPS AND OUTPUTS WILL BRING ECONOMIC VALUE AND SUSTAINABILITY TO WYOMING FARMERS. LONGER, MORE DIVERSE CROP ROTATIONS INCREASE SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND NITROGEN, AND SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS. HEALTHY SOILS CAN INCREASE INCOME THROUGH INCREASING YIELDS AND REDUCING PRODUCTION COSTS BY PROVIDING BETTER NUTRIENT AND WATER USE EFFICIENCIES, IMPROVING RESISTANCE TO DISEASE AND INSECT DAMAGE, AND BY REDUCING TILLAGE PASSES. TO INCREASE SOIL HEALTH, UWE WILL WORK WITH PRODUCERS TO IDENTIFY DIVERSE CROP ROTATIONS AND FACILITATE ADOPTION OF REDUCED-TILLAGE PRACTICES IN INTENSIVE IRRIGATED CROPPING SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, CONSUMERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC ARE INTERESTED IN FARMING SYSTEMS THAT CONSERVE NATURAL RESOURCES AND BIODIVERSITY. COMMUNITY ECONOMIC VITALITY - THE OVERALL GOAL OF UW EXTENSION ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAMING IS TO IMPROVE THE VIBRANCY OF WYOMING'S E CONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL COMMUNITY-BASED EFFORTS WILL BE FACILITATED TO IMPROVE THE ECOSYSTEM FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURES TO DEVELOP, INCLUDING THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT COMMUNITY ECONOMICDEVELOPMENT IS AND THE ROLE OF INDIVIDUALS, HOUSEHOLDS, BUSINESSES, COMMUNITIES, AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE IN BUILDING AND MAINTAINING A STRONG ECONOMY; DEVELOP AND SUPPORT PROGRAMMING IN YO UTH ENTREPRENEURSHIP; AND BUILD SKILLS IN VENTURE MANAGEMENT. CRITICAL ISSUE: HUMAN HEALTH, WELLNESS AND NUTRITION DESCRIPTION: THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION ESTIMATES THAT \"EACH YEAR 48 MILLION PEOPLE GET SICK, 128,000 ARE H OSPITALIZED, AND 3,000 DIE OF FOODBORNE DISEASES\" IN THE UNITED STATES. RISK FACTORS RANGE FROM CONTAMINATED FOOD PRODUCTS TO FOODBORNE ILLNESSES RESULTING FROM IMPROPER FOOD HANDLING AND FOOD PRODUCTION PRACTICES. OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY RATES CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND PLACE WYOMING RESIDENTS AT INCREASED RISK OF CHRONIC OBESITY-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS EASY ACCESS TO UNHEALTHY FAST FOODS, LIMITED ACCESS TO RECREATIONAL FACILITIES OR PARKS, AND FEW SAFE OR EASY WAYS TO WALK IN A NEIGHBORHOOD INCREASE THE RISK OF BEINGOVERWEIGHT AND OBESE. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOCUSING ON FOOD SAFETY WILL STRIVE TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCES OF FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. USDA/FDA FOOD SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE DELIVERED THROUGH PROGRAMS FOR FOOD SERVICE EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES PRESERVING AND PREPARING FOOD IN PRIVATE HOMES. MANY HEALTH, WELLNESS AND NUTRITION DECISIONS DEPEND NOT ONLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL BUT ALSO ON SOCIAL, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENT (PSE) STRATEGIES WILL BE USED TO INCREASE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHANGES AND DECREASE RISK OF OBESITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE. THE GOAL WILL BE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS WHO MEET THE NATIONAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES AND THE NATIONAL DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS. PARTICIPATION IN HORTICULTURE PROGRAMS WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS TO BE MORE SELF-SUFFICIENT IN FOOD PRODUCTION AND LIVE A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE. UWE PROGRAMMING AREAS TO SUPPORT HUMAN HEALTH, WELLNESS AND NUTRITION: HEATH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION - IMPROVED NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS DECREASE RISK OF OBESITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE (E.G., DIABETES), WHICH ARE MAJOR ISSUES IN WYOMING. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WILL BE OFFERED TO INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND STRENGTH TRAINING; INCREASE INTAKE OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES, AND WHOLE GRAINS; AND DECREASE FOODS TO LIMIT ADDED SALT, SUGAR, AND FAT. USDA/FDA FOOD SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE TAUGHT IN PROGRAMS FOR FOOD SERVICE EMPLOYEES AND FAMILIES PRESERVING AND PREPARING FOOD AT HOME. HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS - GOING BEYOND EDUCATION IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AND DECREASE RATES OF CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY. INDIVIDUALS MUST ALSO LIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT FACILITATES MAKING THE HEALTHY CHOICE THE EASY CHOICE. EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENT (PSE) STRATEGIES CAN IMPROVE NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS AND DECREASE RISK OF OBESITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE (E.G., DIABETES). EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE WORKING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADOPT RECOMMENDED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND NUTRITION PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES AND WILL BE MEASURED BY THE NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES MADE TO SUPPORT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUCH AS WALKING PATHS, STAIRWAY POSTERS, ETC. CONSUMER HORTICULTURE - CONSUMER HORTICULTURE IS ANYTHING RELATED TO PLANTS, GARDENS, OR LANDSCAPES THAT COULD BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. PARTICIPATION IN HORTICULTURAL PROGRAMS ALSO ENCOURAGES WYOMING RESIDENTS TO BE MORE SELF-SUFFICIENT AND LIVE A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE BY INCREASING THEIR ACCESS TO FRESH PRODUCE. CRITICAL ISSUE: NATURAL SYSTEMS, FOOD AND FIBER PRODUCTION DESCRIPTION: INCREASING CLIMATE VARIABILITY, GLOBAL POPULATION GROWTH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION HAS PLACED UNPRECEDENTED BURDENS ON OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS. WYOMING'S ECONOMY IS BASED HEAVILY ON NATURAL RESOURCE USE (MINERAL EXTRACTION, TOURISM <(>&<)> RECREATION, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION), WITH NEARLY HALF ITS LAND AREA PUBLICLY OWNED AND MANAGED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. A MULTIDISCIPLINARY, SYSTEMS-BASED RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL APPROACH THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THOUGHTFUL MANAGEMENT OF WYOMING'S ABUNDANT NATURAL RESOURCES IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD. SCIENCE-BASED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL TO IMPROVING PUBLIC POLICY, REDUCING CONFLICT, AND CONTRIBUTING TO ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY. WYOMING'S PROGRAMS SEEK TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS OF SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE INCLUDING PRODUCTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS, HEALTHY FORESTS AND RANGELANDS, WATER AND SOIL QUALITY, AND SUSTAINABLE LAND USE. WITH STAKEHOLDER INPUT, PROGRAMS WILL ADVANCE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION TO IMPROVE FOOD SECURITY, REDUCE HUNGER, INCREASE ECONOMIC RETURNS, AND SUPPORT THRIVING RURAL ECONOMIES. IN ADDITION, THESE PROGRAMS WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF URBAN AND SMALL ACREAGE LANDOWNERS, PROVIDING EDUCATION IN SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND HORTICULTURAL PRACTICES. PURSUITOF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, AND DI STRIBUTION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF FOOD, FIBER, AND BIOENERGY. THESE PROGRAMS WILL AID IN THE MAINTENANCE OF WYOMING'S NATURAL SYSTEMS WHILE CONTINUING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE NEEDS OF A GROWING GLOBAL POPULATION. UWE PROGRAMMING AREAS TO SUPPORT NATURAL SYSTEMS, FOOD AND FIBER PRODUCTION: INVASIVE AND NOXIOUS WEEDS - INVASIVE WEEDS CAN CHANGE THE ECOLOGY OF A LANDSCAPE BY REPLACING NATIVE VEGETATION WHICH WILL HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON SOIL HEALTH, WILDLIFE BOTH INVERTEBRATES AND VERTEBRATES, AND LIVESTOCK. LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT INVASIVE WEEDS CAUSE A REDUCTION IN FORAGE AND SEEK EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND TRIALS TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF INVASIVE WEEDS. LANDOWNERS AND LAND MANAGERS PARTICIPATING IN UWE PROGRAMS WILL SEE REDUCED AREAS INFESTED WITH INVASIVE AND NOXIOUS WEEDS. OTHERS THAT BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THE SPREAD OF INVASIVE WEEDS ARE OUTDOOR RECREATIONISTS FROM HIKERS TO HUNTERS. CONTROLLING INVASIVE WEEDS MAINTAINS THE NATIVE VEGETATION WHICH IN TURN MAINTAINS THE ECOSYSTEM FOR THEM TO ENJOY OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL ENDEAVORS. COVER CROPS - COVER CROPS IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND FUNCTION OF SOIL. THESE BENEFITS LEAD TO BETTER NUTRIENT CYCLING, IMPROVED WATER INFILTRATION AND MORE CONSISTENT YIELDS OVER TIME. ADDITIONALLY, COVER CROPS SUPPRESS WEEDS, PREVENT EROSION, CONTROL DISEASES AND PESTS AS WELL AS HELP POLLINATORS. COVER CROPS ARE ALSO USED TO PROVIDE FORAGE FOR LIVESTOCK. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ASSIST PRODUCERS IN GATHERING RESOURCES ON COVER CROP OPTIONS, HOW TO PLANT AND STRATEGIES FOR USE. INTEREST IN COVER CROPS HAS GROWN AS PRODUCERS HAVE SEEN INCREASED FORAGE SUPPLY, GROWING FORAGES IN PLACES THAT HAD BEEN UNPRODUCTIVE, AND IN WEED CONTROL EFFORTS. GENERAL PUBLIC RANGE EDUCATION - WHEN PUBLIC SPACE IS CONCERNED, THE DECISION MAKER CAN BE ANYONE. UNDERSTANDING HOW THE SHARED RESOURCE IS USED AND MANAGED CAN HELP NAVIGATE CONFLICT RESULTING FROM DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS OF USER GROUPS. EXAMPLES OF UNDERSTANDING BASIC CAUSE AND EFFECT WITH THE ECOSYSTEM INCLUDE WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO 'SHUT THE GATE', OR A RECREATIONAL FISHERMAN UNDERSTANDING THE SENSITIVITIES OF A RIPARIAN ZONE. ACCESS TO AND DEMAND ON RANGELANDS - MULTIPLE USER GROUPS REQUIRE AND/OR VALUE ACCESS TO UNMODIFIED RANGELANDS IN THE WESTERN US. MANY RANCHERS RELY ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO GRAZE LARGE ACREAGES OF PUBLIC LAND TO MAINTAIN THE VIABILITY OF THEIR BUSINESS. INCREASINGLY, RECREATIONISTS (TO INCLUDE HUNTERS, HIKERS, WILDLIFE VIEWERS, ETC.) ARE VALUING THE WIDE-OPEN SPACES THAT RANGELANDS PROVIDE.

A FIFTH REGIONAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CENTER IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE REMAINS COMMITTED TO THIS STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH A PRESENCE IN ALL 75 ARKANSAS COUNTIES, ENSURING THAT RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION EDUCATORS ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE SCIENCE AND BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE AND THE BROADER NEEDS OF FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. CONSISTENT WITH THE LAND GRANT MISSION, DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION FACULTY HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING LEADERSHIP IN THE DEVELOPMENT, DISSEMINATION AND DELIVERY OF INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. DIVISION RESEARCHERS CONDUCT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH FOR ARKANSAS PRODUCERS, BUSINESSES, COMMUNITIES, AND FAMILIES. COUNTY AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS STRIVE TO PROVIDE THE BEST SCIENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH STAKEHOLDERS ARE EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE SOURCES AND COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION AND DATA, THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE REMAINS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF IMPARTIAL AND SCIENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS, INDEPENDENT OF FINANCIAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL INTERESTS. ALTHOUGH MOST IN-PERSON EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES HAVE RESUMED, THE DIVISION WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER TIMELY AND RESPONSIVE DISTANCE ED UCATION WEBINARS AND RESOURCES IN 2023 TO ENSURE WIDE-SPREAD ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BY ARKANSANS. THIS INCLUDES MONTHLY WEBINARS THROUGH THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL LAW CENTER ON CURRENT AND EMERGING IMPORTANT AGRICULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOOD LAW TOPICS. ONLINE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE 24/7/365 THROUGH THE DIVISION'S WEBSITE (HTTP://COURSES.UADA.EDU). DIVISION FACULTY ALSO ADDRESS TIMELY TOPICS OF INTEREST TO ARKANSANS THROUGH VIRTUAL EVENTS AND OTHER WEB-BASED PROGRAMMING. THE FOCUS OF WORK CONDUCTED BY THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO BE GUIDED ANNUALLY BY GRASS-ROOTS, COMMUNITY-BASED INPUT FROM A DIVERSE RANGE OF ARKANSAS CITIZENS; MAINLY THROUGH THE USE OF COUNTY EXTENSION COUNCILS AND OTHER LOCAL AND PROGRAM ADVISORY GROUPS. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE FORMALLY ENGAGED A LARGE POOL OF STAKEHOLDERS (INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL CLIENTELE, PRODUCERS, SCHOOLS, PARTNER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY LEADERS, UNDERSERVED GROUPS, AND LEGISLATORS) IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE 2017-2023 STRATEGIC PLAN. BASED ON BROAD STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK, THE DIVISION IDENTIFIED FIVE AREAS TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS: AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING, ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD, STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES, BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES, AND NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT. THESE FIVE EMPHASIS AREAS HELP TO PROVIDE STRATEGIC LOCAL GUIDANCE FOR DIVISION RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AND HELP TO SUPPORT INTEGRATED RESEARCH/EXTENSION EFFORTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE NIFA SCIENCE EMPHASIS AREAS. AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING A CRITICAL NEED IN ARKANSAS, AND NATIONWIDE, IS TO ENSURE FARM AND FOREST ENTERPRISES ARE PROFITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE TO MEET THE DEMANDS FOR SAFE FOOD, FIBER, AND FUEL. THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY MUST CONTEND WITH MORE REGULATIONS, HIGHER INPUT COSTS, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, CLIMATE EXTREMES, AND GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IN A HUMANE AND SUSTAINABLE MANNER WHILE DECREASING COSTS THROUGH EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. PLANT SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE ECONOMICS, ENVIRONMENT, GENETICS AND BREEDING, WEEDS, DISEASE, PEST MANAGEMENT, SAFE HANDLING AND STORAGE, FOOD PROCESSING, CULTURAL PRACTICES, AND SOIL FERTILITY. ANIMAL SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE GENETICS, REPRODUCTION, ECONOMICS, NUTRITION, WASTE MANAGEMENT, PHYSIOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS, HEALTH, AND ANIMAL WELLBEING. COMMON TO BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL SYSTEMS IS THE APPROPRIATE USE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY. ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOODS THE AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD IS VITAL TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN ALL COMMUNITIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE WORKS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETS THROUGH RESEARCH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS THAT TARGET OBESITY AND ENCOURAGE BETTER CONSUMER HABITS THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE EXPANDED FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM (EFNEP) AND SNAP-ED. EFNEP EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, WITH LIMITED INCOME, TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ATTITUDE, AND BEHAVIOR CHANGES NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN NUTRITIONALLY SOUND DIETS AND ENHANCE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. SNAP-ED PROVIDES NUTRITION EDUCATION TO FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE NUTRITION ASSISTANCE TO HELP CONSUMERS MAKE BETTER CHOICES ABOUT WHAT TO EAT TO STAY ACTIVE AND LIVE BETTER. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN FOOD SYSTEMS THROUGH RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY IN ARKANSAS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE INDUSTRY'S ABILITY TO INNOVATE, TO RESPOND TO CONSUMERS' TASTE AND EXPECTATIONS, TO EMPLOY A QUALITY WORKFORCE AND TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE MAINTAINING ECONOMIC VIABILITY. PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS AND AGENCIES ARE PURSUED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS FOODS. EXTENSION PROGRAMS HELP PEOPLE FROM MANY BACKGROUNDS UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE WISE NUTRITIONAL CHOICES AND STRETCH FOOD DOLLARS BY COOKING FOR THEMSELVES AND UTILIZE A WIDER VARIETY OF FOODS. THE DIVISION ALSO STRIVES TO ENHANCE FOOD SAFETY THROUGH RESEARCH AND TEACHING BEST PRACTICES TO ALL WHO HANDLE FOOD, FROM FIELD TO TABLE. THIS INCLUDES EDUCATION RELATED TO FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, SUCH AS HOW TO ADHERE TO THE FDA'S PRODUCE SAFETY RULE AND MEETING CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THROUGH SERVSAFE, A FOOD SAFETY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN FOOD HANDLING OR FOOD SERVICE AND RELATED INDUSTRIES. EXTENSION EDUCATORS PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT ARKANSANS ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE BEST FOOD SAFETY INFORMATION TO KEEP THEIR FAMILIES SAFE FROM FOODBORNE ILLNESSES AND OTHER FOOD-RELATED SAFETY ISSUES. STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES IT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES THAT AFFECT FAMILIES, CONSUMERS, AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE. THE MENTAL, PHYSICAL, AND FINANCIAL WELL-BEING OF FAMILIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING PROSPERITY FOR ARKANSANS. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE IS RESPONDING TO THESE NEEDS BY DELIVERING RESEARCH-BASED PROGRAMS TO REDUCE STRESS, IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH, STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS, INCREASE FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND IMPROVE WELL-BEING FOR ARKANSANS. 4-H CLUBS, ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS ACROSS ARKANSAS INVOLVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN HANDS-ON EDUCATION AND SERVICE-LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT ENHANCED THEIR LIFE SKILLS, INCLUDING DECISION MAKING, PROBLEM SOLVING, CRITICAL THINKING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES. 4-H CONVEYS TO THE PUBLIC THAT ALL YOUTH HAVE VALUE. STRIVING TO REACH A DIVERSE POPULATION IS KEY TO DEVELOPING CURRICULUM, OFFERING RECOGNITION, AND TEACHING STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS TO REPRESENT OUR STATE'S CURRENT DEMOGRAPHICS. BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY, TECHNOLOGY AND POPULATION ARE TRANSFORMING HOW ARKANSANS LIVE AND WORK. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND EFFECTIVELY EMPLOY TOOLS AND RESOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LABOR FORCE REQUIRES ENHANCED SKILLS AND TRAINING TO SUCCEED IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY. AT A TIME WHEN MANY RURAL AREAS ARE LOSING POPULATION, COMMUNITIES MUST TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO CREATE A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE. EFFECTIVE AND INCLUSIVE LEADERS WORKING WITH ENGAGED CITIZENS ARE KEY TO THIS EFFORT. TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL NEEDS, PROGRAMS FOCUS ON FOUR AREAS: ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EVOLVING ECONOMIES; LEADERSHIP AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT; AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE. NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ARKANSAS FACES CRITICAL NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUES INCLUDING GROUNDWATER DECLINE IN EASTERN ARKANSAS FROM IRRIGATION, WATER QUALITY CONCERNS FROM ANIMAL MANURES, SEDIMENT LOSS FROM CROPLAND AND URBAN STORMWATER. WE ALL SHARE CONCERNS FOR SOIL HEALTH, AIR QUALITY, PROTECTION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OF FORESTS AND WILDLIFE HABITAT, BUT AGRICULTURE IS UNDER SCRUTINY TO REDUCE IMPACT ON NATURAL RESOURCES. WE FOCUS ON UNBIASED RESEARCH AND SCIENCE-BASED EXTENSION EFFORTS TO BALANCE CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. PROGRAMS, SUCH AS ARKANSAS DISCOVERY FARMS AND THE CENTER FOR AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SUSTAINABILITY, WILL COLLABORATE WITH FARMERS, LANDOWNERS, AND INDUSTRY TO DELIVER INNOVATIVE, SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE PROPER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO INFORM RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS, THE DIVISION WILL LAUNCH A FORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT IN 2023 TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIES FOR THE ORGANIZATION'S NEW STRATEGIC PLAN WITH INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bc2ca285-0b30-8c83-d330-1d7722983022-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLBCXXXXG041_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736085, "Award ID": "NI23SLBCXXXXG040", "Award Amount": 1226219.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "THE URI COLLEGE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND LIFE SCIENCES (CELS) IS THE HOME OF RHODE ISLAND'S AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (AES) AND COOPERATIVE EXTENSION (EXTENSION).

ENHANCING AND CONSERVING FLORIDA'S NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. FLORIDA MUST ACTIVELY MANAGE FINITE NATURAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. PRESSURES INCLUDE THE LOSS OF NATURAL AREAS, AN INCREASE IN URBAN DEVELOPMENT, THE USE OF ENERGY AND WATER RESOURCES, AND GROWING IMPACTS ON MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOCUS ON RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT, AND BMP IMPLEMENTATION AND PROVIDE IN?DEPTH TRAINING FOR VOLUNTEERS TO ASSIST IN OUR EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS. FLORIDIANS ACQUIRE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE ROLE IN THE STATE'S EFFORT TO ENHANCE AND PROTECT NATURAL RESOURCES, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST PROVIDE LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUES THAT BALANCE THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS. OUTCOMES MEASURED INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF ACRES ON WHICH RECOMMENDED ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED TO MANAGE OR SUSTAINABLY USE FISH AND WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT, INCLUDING CONTROL OF INVASIVE SPECIES AND PESTS, IN NATURAL AREAS AND WORKING LANDSCAPES INCLUDING FRESHWATER, MARINE, AND WETLAND ENVIRONMENTS, RANGELANDS, FORESTS, PARKS AND OTHER GREEN SPACE IN RURAL OR URBAN AREAS; ADULTS AND YOUTH WHO COMPLETED ADULT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY AND SUSTAINABILITY, INCLUDING WATER AWARENESS PROGRAMS; PARTICIPANTS WHO USED INFORMATION FROM ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY AND SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMS IN A PROFESSIONAL OR WORK?RELATED CONTEXT AS VOLUNTEERS OR EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING DOCENTS, TEACHERS, PARK RANGERS, ECOTOUR GUIDES, ETC.); ADULTS AND YOUTH WHO USED INFORMATION FROM ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMS TO ADOPT PERSONAL STEWARDSHIP BEHAVIORS (E.G., CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN ONE'S HOME OR RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY). EMPOWERING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO BUILD HEALTHY LIVES THROUGH NUTRITION, WELLNESS, AND FOOD SAFETY. FLORIDA EXTENSION PROGRAMS FOCUS ON CREATING LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR CHANGES RELATED TO NUTRITION AND HEALTH, FOOD SAFETY, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. FOOD SAFETY EXTENSION PROGRAMS EDUCATE FARM WORKERS, AS WELL AS RESTAURANT MANAGERS AND WORKERS, FOOD ENTREPRENEURS, AND CONSUMERS. OUR AUDIENCES MANY DIVERSE FAMILY STRUCTURES AND UNDERSERVED GROUPS, SUCH AS TEENAGE PARENTS, SINGLE PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS RAISING GRANDCHILDREN, COHABITING COUPLES, DUAL?EARNER FAMILIES, MILITARY FAMILIES, AGING ADULTS, AND CAREGIVING FAMILIES. POVERTY, SOCIAL ISOLATION, PARENTAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION, STRESS, CHILD ABUSE, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND MARITAL INSTABILITY, HOUSING ISSUES, CAREGIVING DECISIONS, AND STRESS CAUSED BY CARING FOR AGING PARENTS ARE MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR OUR CLIENTS. PANDEMICS, HURRICANES, AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS PRESENT ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FOR FLORIDIANS. EXTENSION PROGRAMS HELP THE FAMILIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HEALTHY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN AND HELP THEM IMPROVE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY FUNCTION AND WELL?BEING.

EMPOWERING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO ACHIEVE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SUCCESS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING, FORECLOSURE, HOME MAINTENANCE, AND ENERGY COSTS ARE ALSO ALWAYS PRESSING CHALLENGES FOR FLORIDIANS. FLORIDA EXTENSION CAN IMPROVE ECONOMIC VIABILITY FOR LOW? AND MIDDLE?INCOME FAMILIES, SENIOR CITIZENS, IMMIGRANT FAMILIES, SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND TEACHERS THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS. FLORIDA EXTENSION'S COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (CRD) PROGRAM ENGAGES AND EMPOWERS COMMUNITIES TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE THROUGH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, CAPACITY BUILDING, PUBLIC POLICY EDUCATION, AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. CRD PROGRAMS HELP COUNTIES, CITIES, AND INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTAND THEIR LOCAL ECONOMIES AND ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL ECONOMIC LOSS OR DEVELOPMENT, AND AIDS INDIVIDUALS, ENTREPRENEURS, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, EXISTING BUSINESSES, AND OTHERS WITH TRAINING FOR BUSINESS START?UPS, RETENTION, AND/OR EXPANSION. GIVEN FLORIDA'S POPULATION GROWTH, ISSUES SUCH AS LAND USE AND GROWTH AND THE INTERFACE BETWEEN RURAL/URBAN AND INCORPORATED/UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE CITIZENS, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND COMMUNITIES. FLORIDA EXTENSION PROGRAMS WILL FOCUS ON TEACHING ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND TO BUILD LEADERSHIP IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO DIRECT DEVELOPMENTS. THIS PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO EDUCATE NOT JUST LOCAL ELECTED DECISION MAKERS ABOUT THEIR DUTIES, ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND HOW TO MAKE PUBLIC POLICY CHOICES, BUT ALL WHO WISH TO ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS OF COMMUNITY BUILDING. EXPANDING PARTNERSHIPS WITH STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT ELECTED OFFICIALS ON POLICY ALTERNATIVES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM. OUTCOMES MEASURED INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF: ADULT AND YOUTH PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING IMPROVEMENT IN MONEY MANAGEMENT SKILLS OR FINANCIAL CAPABILITY (I.E., EARNINGS/INCOME, SPENDING, SAVING, INVESTING, BORROWING, PROTECTING); PARTICIPANTS THAT LEARNED ABOUT FINANCIAL CAPABILITY SUCH AS EARNINGS/INCOME, SPENDING, SAVING AND INVESTING, BORROWING, PROTECTING ASSETS; PARTICIPANTS THAT ADOPTED AN EFFECTIVE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT/CONSUMER ECONOMICS PRACTICE OR BEHAVIOR; PARTICIPANTS THAT COMPLETED AN IMPORTANT FINANCIAL MILESTONE SUCH AS AN IMPROVED CREDIT SCORE, A HOME PURCHASE, TAXES FILED, LOAN PAID OFF, OR ESTATE PLANNING COMPLETED; PARTICIPANTS WHO INCREASED POSITIVE INTERACTION OR DECREASED NEGATIVE INTERACTION OR WHO INCREASED POSITIVE BONDS OR WHO INCREASED SATISFACTION/WELLBEING; DOLLAR VALUE OF GRANTS GENERATED BY ORGANIZATIONS OR COMMUNITIES YOU ASSISTED; DOLLAR VALUE OF OTHER IN?KIND RESOURCES CONTRIBUTED BY ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES; HOURS THAT VOLUNTEERS IN YOUR COUNTY WORK WITH CLIENTELE; NEW OR REVISED PLANS ADOPTED THAT HAVE BEGUN TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN A COMMUNITY, AGENCY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, BUSINESS, OR DISASTER; NEW ALLIANCES FORMED THROUGH SOME TYPE OF FORMAL AGREEMENT OR MOU, OR INFORMALLY. PREPARING YOUTH TO BE RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS AND PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF THE WORKFORCE. PARTICIPATION IN 4?H CLUBS PROVIDES THE POSITIVE, SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT YOUTH NEED TO SUCCEED. SCHOOL ENRICHMENT, DAY AND RESIDENTIAL CAMPS, AND OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS OFFERED BY FLORIDA EXTENSION INTRODUCE YOUTH TO LONGER?TERM LEARNING EXPERIENCES. 4?H PROGRAMMING FOCUSES ON MEETING THE HIGHEST?PRIORITY EDUCATIONAL NEEDS: HELPING YOUTH DEVELOP SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATH (STEM) LITERACY; HELPING YOUTH DEVELOP AN INTEREST IN LEARNING THAT WILL EQUIP THEM TO SUCCEED IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING SOCIETY AND GLOBAL ECONOMY; TEACHING YOUTH RESPONSIBILITY, DEVELOPING THEIR ABILITY TO BECOME LEADERS, AND ENGAGING THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITIES; HELPING YOUTH DEVELOP HEALTHY LIFESTYLES; AND ENCOURAGING YOUTH TO GET OUTDOORS TO APPRECIATE NATURE, AGRICULTURE, AND NATURAL RESOURCES. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE CONTINUOUS PRESENCE OF CARING ADULTS IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. WITH LIMITED STAFF, VOLUNTEERS CAN ASSIST IN REACHING MORE YOUTH. FLORIDA 4?H IS DEVELOPING YOUTH AND ADULT VOLUNTEERS THROUGH TRAINING AND PROVIDING THE SUPPORT NEEDED FOR VOLUNTEER?LED ORGANIZATIONS TO BE EFFECTIVE IN HELPING THE 4?H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM MEET ITS MISSION AND GOALS.

WE DEVELOP AND DELIVER HIGH PRIORITY RESEARCH PROJECTS AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY OUR STAKEHOLDERS. WE REACH NEARLY A MILLION MISSOURIANS EVERY YEAR THROUGH CAMPUS FACULTY AND COUNTY EXTENSION OFFICES WORKING THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S 114 COUNTIES AND THE CITY OF ST. LOUIS. WE INCORPORATE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY INTO INNOVATIVE SERVICE AND PRODUCT DELIVERY SYSTEMS, ONLINE RESOURCES FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS, AND DATA MAPPING, VISUALIZATION, AND REPORTING TOOLS. FUNDING FROM COMPETITIVE GRANTS, GIFTS, AND FEE GENERATION EXCEED THE RESOURCES APPROPRIATED FROM OUR STATE, FEDERAL, AND COUNTY PARTNERS. OUR GOAL IS TO BE RELIABLE, RESPONSIVE AND RELEVANT. WE ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL BY PROVIDING RESEARCH-BASED KNOWLEDGE TO MISSOURIANS ALIGNED WITH THEIR PRIORITIES OF IMPROVING COMMUNITY ECONOMIES, HEALTH, AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY WE SEEK TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS FOR ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL GROW OPPORTUNITIES FOR MISSOURIANS, ENGAGE MISSOURIANS IN ATTAINING SKILLS AND CREDENTIALS, EXPAND THE UNIVERSITY'S ECONOMIC IMPACT, AND WILL DOUBLE THE AGRICULTURE ECONOMY BY 2030 WHILE SUSTAINING NATURAL RESOURCES. OUTSIDE OF MISSOURI'S MAJOR URBAN CENTERS IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN AN ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEM CONDUCIVE TO THE GROWTH OF LOCALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. MU EXTENSION'S CREATING ENTREPRENEURIAL COMMUNITIES CONFERENCE CREATES A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF COMMUNITIES FOCUSED ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEMS. BY BRINGING TOGETHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS, BUSINESS LEADERS AND POLICYMAKERS TO SHARE EVIDENCE-BASED BEST PRACTICES AND IDEAS, THIS CONFERENCE PROMOTES RESILIENCY, SUSTAINABILITY, JOB GROWTH, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF MISSOURI. CONFERENCE SESSIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE HOST COMMUNITY SO PARTICIPANTS CAN SEE, IN REAL TIME, THE IMPACT OF GOOD POLICYMAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION ON A COMMUNITY'S ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEM. THE MISSOURI BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER FOR AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND FORESTRY, ESTABLISHED THROUGH FUNDING FROM THE CARES ACT, IS A CO LLABORATIVE PROGRAM THAT BRINGS NEW ENTREPRENEURS INTO THE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SPACE. THE CENTER BRINGS TOGETHER THE BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCES OF THE MISSOURI SBDC AND THE RESEARCH-BASED, AGRICULTURE-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF MU EXTENSION. IN 2021, THE MISSOURI BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER FOR AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND FORESTRY PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EXPERTISE TO OVER 300 MISSOURI PRODUCERS AND AGRIBUSINESSES. THOSE AGRI-ENTREPRENEURS ATTRACTED MORE THAN $40M IN PRIVATE LOANS AND GRANTS AND CREATED AT LEAST 500 NEW JOBS. MU EXTENSION'S AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT PROGRAM INTENDS TO DOUBLE THE VALUE OF AGRICULTURE IN MISSOURI BY 2030 WHILE SUSTAINING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES ARE A MAJOR THREAT TO THAT GOAL. TWO SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES (SOLUTION-BASED) THAT ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ARE 1) HARNESS DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE LABOR AND NUMBER OF ENTITIES BETWEEN FOOD PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS 2) TRAIN FARMERS, FARM WORKERS, AND OTHERS IN THE FOOD SYSTEM ABOUT HOW TO USE THOSE TECHNOLOGIES. WE RETOOLED OUR MEAT TEAM TO FOCUS ON WORKER TRAINING FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED PROCESSORS. TWO NEW, CUSTOMIZED MOBILE TRAINING UNITS WILL ARRIVE IN MISSOURI IN MARCH 2022. THOSE STATE-OF-THE-ART UNITS DEMONSTRATE THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGIES. WE HAVE A WAITING LIST OF PROCESSORS WHO WANT US TO TRAIN LOCAL WORKERS. WE EXPANDED OUR WORK IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE TO HELP FARMERS AND PROCESSORS EMPLOY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. THE TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRE LESS MUNDANE LABOR AND GIVE GREATER MANAGERIAL FLEXIBILITY. THINK ROBOTS, DRONES, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND A CONNECTED FOOD SYSTEM. OUR TRAINING IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE COVERS INNOVATIONS IN PLANT AND ANIMAL SCIENCES AS WELL AS FOOD PROCESSING. OUR AG BUSINESS AND POLICY TEAM HELPS FARMERS COPE WITH SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES AND FIND POSSIBLE PATHS TO DIRECT MARKETING. THAT SHORTENS THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND ADDS RESILIENCY TO THE FOOD SYSTEM. MU EXTENSION'S COMMUNITY HEALTH ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH AND LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY WORKING AT THE INTERSECTION OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. MU EXTENSION IS CREATING CAPACITY AND DEVELOPING THE FRAMEWORK AND GUIDELINES FOR TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESSES AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TO BE DESIGNATED AS RECOVERY-FRIENDLY WORKPLACES. EMPLOYERS AND BUSINESSES - BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS WILL INCREASE THEIR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT SUBSTANCE MISUSE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND THEIR CONNECTION TO WORKFORCE CHALLENGES THROUGH TRAININGS, A SERIES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, AND THE CREATION AND SHARING OF RESOURCES; CREATE A NETWORK OF BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN CREATING HEALTHY AND SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENTS WHERE EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES, AND COMMUNITIES CAN COLLABORATE TO CREATE POSITIVE CHANGE, ELIMINATE STIGMA AND SUPPORT RECOVERY; AND, RETAIN A HEALTHIER, MORE PRODUCTIVE, AND MORE MOTIVATED WORKFORCE THROUGH THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH AND SAFETY PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES. HEALTH AND HEALTHY FUTURES WE SEEK TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF MISSOURI COMMUNITIES AND INCREASE POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES THROUGH EDUCATION RELATED TO NUTRITION AND OTHER HEALTH BEHAVIORS. OUR FALL RISK REDUCTION PROGRAMS ARE NEEDED FOR MISSOURI'S LARGE AND GROWING OLDER ADULT POPULATION. SUPPORTING AND OFFERING FALL PREVENTION PROGRAMS THROUGH MU EXTENSION AND OUR PARTNER NETWORK ALLOWS US TO ENGAGE MORE OLDER ADULTS IN EVIDENCE-BASED FALL PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS WHICH DECREASE FALLING, THE FEAR OF FALLING, INCREASE ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND IMPROVE OUTLOOK ON LIFE. THESE SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES OFTEN LEAD TO LONG-TERM BENEFITS, SUCH AS INCREASED INDEPENDENCE, LONGEVITY, AND REDUCED ECONOMIC BURDEN. THROUGH THIS PROJECT WE HAVE REDUCED THE PERCENTAGE OF OLDER ADULTS WHO REPORT FALLING IN MISSOURI, REDUCED THE NUMBER OF INJURIES RELATED TO FALLS, DECREASED THE NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS WHO FEAR FALLING, REDUCED MEDICAL CARE COSTS, AND INCREASED THE NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS MEETING THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES. RURAL MISSOURI IS FACING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, FUELED BY GROWING ECONOMIC AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT ARE SEVERELY AFFECTING THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. THESE STRESSORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AMONG RURAL MISSOURIANS, ESPECIALLY FARMERS AND RANCHERS. DESPITE THE CLEAR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF RURAL MISSOURIANS, TOOLS AND SUPPORT ARE OFTEN LIMITED. OUR FARM AND RANCH STRESS PROGRAMS USE FIELD TESTED WORKSHOPS, RURAL PARTICIPANTS WERE EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH, WERE CONNECTED TO USEFUL MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AND WERE GIVEN FREE ACCESS TO ONE-ON-ONE TELEPSYCHOLOGY (ONLINE THERAPY) SESSIONS. OUR STAY STRONG, STAY HEALTHY RESISTANCE TRAINING PROGRAM, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE MUSCLE STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE IN OLDER ADULTS OF ALL AGES AND FITNESS LEVELS. THIS IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED RESISTANCE TRAINING PROGRAM THAT IS AFFORDABLE, A CCESSIBLE, AND HIGHLY BENEFICIAL TO A LARGE PROPORTION OF OLDER ADULTS. SOCIAL JUSTICE MU EXTENSION WORKS TOWARD SOCIAL JUSTICE BY PROVIDING RESEARCHED-BASED AND EVIDENCED-BASED EDUCATION, SERVICES, AND SUPPORT IN LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT, NUTRITION, HOME <(>&<)> FAMILIES, HEALTH AND SAFETY, YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AND WORKFORCE READINESS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE EMPOWERING RESIDENTS OF ALL AGES TO ADVOCATE FOR CHANGES TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES THAT PLAGUE THEIR LIVES AND COMMUNITIES. ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES MU EXTENSION FORESTRY AND WILDLIFE INITIATIVES SUCH AS MISSOURI MASTER NATURALIST, MISSOURI MASTER POLLINATOR STEWARD, MISSOURI NATIVE GRASS EXTENSION PROJECT, CONTROLLING NUISANCE WILDLIFE PROGRAM, AND MISSOURI FERAL HOG EXTENSION PROJECT, PROVIDE MISSOURI CITIZENS WITH RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION THAT ENABLES INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS RELATED TO NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ON THEIR PROPERTIES. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE THOSE THAT ENABLE VOLUNTEERS TO CONDUCT NATURAL RESOURCE EDUCATION AND STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES, EXPANDING THE CAPABILITY OF THE MU EXTENSION TO REACH GREATER NUMBERS OF CLIENTELE AND IMPACT AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ACRES FOR NATURAL RESOURCE BENEFITS. SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS NEW PROGRAMS, LIKE OUR AGRICULTURAL INNOVATION CENTER, INTEND TO BRING RESILIENCY TO THE FOOD SYSTEM WITH ENTREPRENEURSHIP. AND OUR LONG-SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS LIKE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT, GRAZING SCHOOLS, SHOW-ME-SELECT REPLACEMENT HEIFERS, AGRICULTURAL LENDERS SCHOOL, AND SO MANY OTHERS WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE BEST-IN-CLASS EXTENSION EDUCATION. ALL OUR PROGRAMS SEEK SUSTAINABILITY. ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS STRIVE FOR RESILIENCY THROUGH INNOVATION. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES (SOLUTION-BASED) THAT ADDRESS FOOD SYSTEM RESILIENCY ISSUES ARE DEVELOPING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE LABOR AND NUMBER OF ENTITIES BETWEEN FOOD PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS; AND TRAINING FOR FARMERS, FARM WORKERS, AND OTHERS IN THE FOOD SYSTEM ABOUT HOW TO USE THOSE TECHNOLOGIES. EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS MISSOURI 4-H SERVES MORE THAN 50,000 YOUTH, OFFERING MORE THAN 100 PROJECTS RELATED TO DIFFERENT FIELDS TO HELP THEM DISCOVER THEIR SPARK AND PASSION IN LIFE. MISSOURI 4-H IS TAKING A TWOFOLD APPROACH TO COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. FIRST, COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS PIECES ARE WOVEN INTO OUR REGULAR PROGRAMMING EVEN AT THE YOUNGEST AGES. THIS CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS DISCUSSING POSSIBLE CAREERS IN ENJOYED PROJECT AREAS AND BY WORKING ON SOFT SKILLS, SUCH AS INTERACTING WITH OTHERS AND LEARNING TO EXPRESS IDEAS. SECONDLY, THE YOUTH FUTURES PROGRAM OFFERS YOUTH WHO FACE OBSTACLES THAT MIGHT MAKE SUCCESS SEEM OUT OF REACH THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE COLLEGE AS AN ATTAINABLE GOAL. MISSOURI 4-H YOUTH FUTURES IS AN EXTENSIVE COLLEGE ORIENTATION PROGRAM THAT PROMOTES COLLEGE AS AN ATTAINABLE GOAL FOR HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH WHO MAY NOT NECESSARILY CONSIDER COLLEGE AS AN OPTION, SUCH AS FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO HELP YOUTH PREPARE FOR, ENROLL IN AND GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. YOUTH WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE 4-H STATE AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS LEARN ABOUT COLLEGE AND CAREER PATHWAYS RELATING TO AGRICULTURE AND GAIN THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THESE AREAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f261384c-3ac1-b344-de46-81708f87aa6a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLBCXXXXG036_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736187, "Award ID": "NI23SLBCXXXXG035", "Award Amount": 6255782.71, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "OKLAHOMA HAS DIVERSE NATURAL RESOURCES, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION REGIONS AND COMMODITIES, COMMUNITIES, FAMILIES, BUSINESSES, AND INDUSTRIES.

RESEARCH AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVES CONDUCTED IN CONNECTICUT OFTEN OVERLAP INTO ONE OR MORE OF THESE AREAS AND OUR TEAMS WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO ADDRESS ISSUES. OUR PLAN OF WORK DESCRIBES FOUR CRITICAL ISSUES FOR CONNECTICUT THAT CONNECTICUT AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (CAES) AND THE UCONN STORRS AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION AND COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SYSTEM (UCONN) WILL JOINTLY ADDRESS BASED ON OUR STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THESE INCLUDE: 1. SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SUPPLY; 2. ENHANCING HEALTH AND WELLBEING; 3. SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPES ACROSS URBANRURAL INTERFACES; AND 4. ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE TO A CHANGING CLIMATE.  EXTENSION IS ACTIVELY INCREASING DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND JUSTICE INITIATIVES ACROSS ALL OUR PROGRAM AREAS. IT IS ONE OF THE FIVE CAHNR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND ALL OUR PROGRAMS ALIGN WITH IT. WE ARE WORKING WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS, STAKEHOLDERS, AND ADVISORS TO PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS AND ACCESSIBILITY. SMITH LEVER FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED TO STAFF AND EXTENSION INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS REPORTED IN THE NIFA REPORTING SYSTEM. UCONN EXTENSION HAS OVER 100 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE STRENGTHENING COMMUNITIES IN CONNECTICUT AND BEYOND. PROGRAMS DELIVERED BY EXTENSION REACH INDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES, AND BUSINESSES IN EACH OF THE 169 MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS THE STATE, WITH NO FEWER THAN SEVEN PROGRAMS IN EACH MUNICIPALITY AND SOME HAVING 33 PROGRAMS OR SERVICES. EXTENSION OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT COVERS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF TOPICS ALIGNED TO THE CAHNR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. EXTENSION IS UNIQUE BECAUSE THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE ARE PLACEBASED. THIS PLACEBASED PERSPECTIVE ALLOWS US TO CUSTOMIZE SOLUTIONS FOR CONNECTICUT RESIDENTS. THE BROADER IMPACTS PROVIDE OUR COMMUNITIES WITH SCIENCEBASED, RESULTS DRIVEN SOLUTIONS. OUR EDUCATORS UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT CONNECTICUT FACES AND COCREATE SOLUTIONS FOR CRITICAL ISSUES WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES. CAHNR EXTENSION PROGRAMS REACHED 157,653 RESIDENTS IN 2021 THROUGH 8,859 HOURS OF INSTRUCTION BY EXTENSION SPECIALISTS ACROSS ALL PROGRAM AREAS. THATS THE EQUIVALENT OF 369 DAYS OF INSTRUCTION. THESE HOURS OF INSTRUCTION WERE PART OF 462 PROGRAMS AND 733 LEARNING EVENTS STATEWIDE. EDUCATORS ALSO HAD 220 PUBLICATIONS THAT SUPPLEMENTED AND SUPPORTED THE INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING PROVIDED. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE BUILDING UPON THESE EFFORTS AND SERVING OUR VARIOUS, DIVERSE AUDIENCES, INCLUDING FARMERS, FAMILIES, STUDENTS, COMMUNITIES, AND BUSINESSES. AGRICULTURE AND FOOD EXTENSION PROGRAMS ADVANCE INNOVATIVE AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL METHODS TO HELP EXPAND PRODUCTION OF A SAFE AND ABUNDANT LOCAL FOOD SUPPLY. WE WORK WITH FARMERS FROM URBAN AND RURAL AREAS, ON LAND AND SEA. OUR EXTENSION PROGRAMS ADDRESS BOTH THE NEED FOR A VIBRANT AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY AND FOOD INSECURITY ISSUES BY CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO ISSUES. WE HAVE OVER 42 EXTENSION PROGRAMS WORKING ON THIS STRATEGIC ISSUE. OBJECTIVES ALIGNED WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING FOOD INSECURITY ARE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SMALL FARMS WITH BUSINESS PLANS, INCREASING THE PRODUCTION OF LOCALLY GROWN FOOD, INCREASING THE PURCHASE OF CONNECTICUT GROWN PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS AND INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS, INCREASING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE METHODS ON FARMS, AND INCREASING CONSUMER KNOWLEDGE OF PREPARATION OF LOCALLY GROWN FOODS. WORK COMPLETED BY EXTENSION IN THESE AREAS WILL DECREASE FOOD INSECURITY IN CONNECTICUT AND THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. OUR GOALS FOR A VIBRANT AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY ARE TO EDUCATE AND TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION, CREATE A PLATFORM FOR COLLABORATION AMONG THE COLLEGE STAKEHOLDERS, AND LEAD RESEARCH AND OUTREACH EFFORTS ON NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATIONS TO IMPROVE NUTRITIONALAND ECONOMIC SECURITY.

PLAN OVERVIEW  1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE GEORGIA PLAN OF WORK (POW) ENCOMPASSES A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2022. THE PLAN ADDRESSES MAJOR AGRICULTURAL ISSUES AS WELL AS MANY OTHER PROBLEMS FACING RURAL AND URBAN AREAS, THE ENVIRONMENT, FAMILIES AND YOUTH. THE PLAN REPRESENTS A COORDINATED EFFORT BETWEEN THE STATE'S 1890 AND 1862 LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS, FORT VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY (FVSU) AND THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA (UGA), AND INCLUDES JOINT PLANNING BETWEEN EXPERIMENT STATIONS AND COOPERATIVE EXTENSION UNITS AT BOTH UNIVERSITIES. GEORGIA, ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 13 COLONIES, HAS A LAND AREA OF 57,701 SQUARE MILES AND A WATER AREA OF 1,706 SQUARE MILES, WHICH MAKES IT THE LARGEST STATE EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER (21TH OVERALL). GEORGIA FALLS WITHIN FIVE MAJOR PHYSIOGRAPHIC REGIONS: THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHEAST; THE RIDGE AND VALLEY PROVINCE AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU IN THE NORTHWEST; THE PIEDMONT ACROSS CENTRAL GEORGIA; AND THE COASTAL PLAIN IN THE SOUTH. ELEVATIONS RANGE FROM SEA LEVEL TO 4,784 FEET AT BRASSTOWN BALD IN THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS. THE 2020 CENSUS ESTIMATED GEORGIA'S POPULATION WAS 10,711,908 AND REPORTED 23.8% OF GEORGIANS ARE UNDER AGE 18 AND 13.9% ARE 65 OR OLDER. ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS,51.9% OF GEORGIANS IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS WHITE/CAUCASIAN, 31% AS BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN, 4.5% AS ASIAN,.5% AS AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE, .1% AS NATIVE HAWAIIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER, AND 6.9% AS MORE THAN ONE RACE. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT 10.5% OF GEORGIANS IDENTIFY AS HISPANIC OR LATINO. GEORGIA'S COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM HAS 167 OFFICES, WITH PROGRAMMING IN ALL OF GEORGIA'S 159 COUNTIES. FVSU AND UGA PERSONNEL ARE HOUSED JOINTLY IN COUNTY OFFICES. EXTENSION DELIVERS PROGRAMMING IN AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES, AND 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AS BOTH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY EFFORTS AND AS MULTICOUNTY PROGRAMS. STATE FACULTY MEMBERS DELIVER TRAINING TO COUNTY AGENTS AND PROGRAMMING DIRECTLY TO CLIENTELE, WHEN APPROPRIATE. FVSU AND UGA RESEARCH PROGRAMS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION SYSTEM. GEORGIA HAS SEVERAL CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE; ITS FOUR LARGEST ARE LOCATED IN ATHENS, FORT VALLEY, TIFTON AND GRIFFIN. GEORGIA HAS ELEVEN RESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS STRATEGICALLY LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS JOINT PLAN OF WORK WAS DEVELOPED AROUND CORE PROGRAMS AND TARGETED ISSUES. USING A STRUCTURED PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM, GEORGIA DEVELOPS CORE PROGRAM DIRECTIONS AND IDENTIFIES TARGETED ISSUES. THE GEORGIA PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS A MULTISTEP PROCESS THAT IS OPERATIONAL EVERY YEAR. THE MODEL INCLUDES A METHOD FOR ASSESSING NEEDS AND IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS. IT ALSO INCLUDES PROGRAM EVALUATION TO DETERMINE IMPACT. THE GEORGIA PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MODEL WORKS IN UNISON WITH MULTIPLE ADVISORY SYSTEMS AT BOTH COUNTY AND STATE LEVELS. INPUT SOLICITED DIRECTLY FROM ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AT FVSU'S COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE, FAMILY SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS UGA'S COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES (CAES) AND COLLEGE OF FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES AS PART OF THE ANNUAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF DEVELOPING THIS PLAN OF WORK. FACULTY MEMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PLAN ARE WORKING ON CUTTING-EDGE PROGRAMS. THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION AND INPUT FROM BOTH THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE AND PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE. THIS INPUT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AS IS A STRONG ADVISORY SYSTEM. THE GEORGIA FEDERAL PLAN OF WORK DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE ALL OF THE WORK OF THE COLLEGES' FACULTY MEMBERS. IT IS INTENDED TO DOCUMENT THE PLANS AND ACTIONS OF THE FACULTY MEMBERS RECEIVING SPECIFIC FORMULA FUNDS. THE MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS ARE USED TO SUPPORT STATE-LEVEL CORE PROGRAMS. THESE CORE PROGRAMS COVER A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL ANIMAL AND PLANT PRODUCTION, POSITIVE YOUTH AND FAMILY DEVELOPMENT, URBAN AGRICULTURE, PERSONAL HEALTH AND WELL- BEING, AND EMERGING ISSUES, SUCH AS BIOFUELS. THE GOALS OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE TO DEMONSTRATE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPACT. HOWEVER, THE GREATEST IMPACTS OF THESE CORE PROGRAMS ARE THE FOUNDATIONS CREATED TO SUPPORT AND LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BEYOND STATE-MATCHING FUNDS. THE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING, COUNTY FUNDING, GRANTS AND GIFTS LEVERAGED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE WORK IN THIS PLAN MAY CREATE THE GREATEST FINAL IMPACT. MOST OF GEORGIA'S PLANNED PROGRAMS INCLUDE OUTCOME MEASURES THAT TRACK THE OUTPUT LEVELS OF LEVERAGED PROGRAMMING. THE OUTPUTS OF THESE LEVERAGED PROGRAMS ARE CONSIDERED A DIRECT, SHORT-TERM OUTCOME OF THE CORE PLANNED PROGRAMS WITHIN THE GEORGIA FEDERAL PLAN OF WORK. THE GEORGIA FEDERAL PLAN OF WORK IS CENTERED ON EIGHT PLANNED PROGRAMS. THESE WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT ISSUES ON COUNTY, STATE, REGIONAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVELS.

MAJOR COMPONENTS IN THE PLANNED PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TARGET YOUTH AND FAMILIES AT RISK. OTHER COMPONENTS TARGET SMALL PRODUCERS, LIMITED RESOURCES FARMERS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. II. MERIT / PEER REVIEW PROCESS UGA CAES AND FVSU INDEPENDENTLY AND COLLABORATIVELY CONDUCT PERIODIC, EXTENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS OF THEIR RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS. THESE REVIEWS COLLECT BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INPUT, INCLUDING INPUT FROM FACULTY AND STAFF, CLIENTELE, ALUMNI AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. THE RESULTS OF THESE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN USED TO FORMULATE THIS PLAN OF WORK. ADDITIONALLY, THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE SOUGHT GUIDANCE FROM THE UGA CAES ADVISORY SYSTEM AND THE FVSU CAFST ADVISORY BOARD THROUGH THEIR CRITICAL REVIEW OF PROGRAMS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS. THIS PLAN OF WORK IS UNDER CONTINUOUS REVIEW BY THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TEAM, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT SPECIALISTS AND COORDINATORS FROM AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES AND 4- H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS FACULTY FROM BOTH FVSU AND UGA. THIS REVIEW IS AN ONGOING PROCESS, AND FUTURE ANNUAL REVIEWS AND CHANGES TO THE PLAN OF WORK WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS TEAM. THE RESEARCH PORTION OF THE PLAN OF WORK UNDERGOES SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PRIOR TO EACH PROJECT BEING SUBMITTED. ALL SCIENTISTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ACTIVE PROJECTS FOR EXPENDITURES TO BE MADE. EACH PROJECT IS PEER-REVIEWED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL REVIEWERS AND MUST BE APPROVED BY THE APPROPRIATE DEAN AND DIRECTOR PRIOR TO SUBMISSION TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. III. STAKEHOLDER INPUT 1. ACTIONS TO SEEK SURVEYS ARE USED AT THE PLANNED PROGRAM LEVEL. INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND SHARED AS PART OF THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE ADVISORY SYSTEM REQUIRES THAT FACULTY SEEK PARTICIPATION BY NONTRADITIONAL STAKEHOLDER INDIVIDUALS. GEORGIA'S ADVISORY SYSTEM ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF THE COMMUNITY. 2. METHODS TO IDENTIFY FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION IDENTIFY ORGANIZATIONS MADE UP OF DIRECT STAKEHOLDERS OR POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS IN ADDRESSING COMMUNITY ISSUES. INPUT IS SOUGHT FROM STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR DEDICATION TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COLLEGE. COUNTY PROGRAMS IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WITH THE ABILITY TO REPRESENT DIVERSE CURRENT OR POTENTIAL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY. RACE, ETHNICITY, INCOME OR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST MAY BE USED TO IDENTIFY THESE GROUPS. 3. METHODS TO COLLECT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, ADVISORY COMMITTEES MEET BY PROGRAM AREA TO CUMULATIVELY IDENTIFY ISSUES; PLAN, EXECUTE AND EVALUATE PROGRAMS; AND COMMUNICATE RESULTS TO THE COMMUNITY. WHEN MAKING HIRING DECISIONS, COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF ACTIVE STAKEHOLDERS ARE SOLICITED VIA EMAIL SURVEY. 4. HOW CONSIDERED STAKEHOLDER INPUT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF GEORGIA'S PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MODEL. STAKEHOLDER INPUT IS CURRENTLY USED FOR PROGRAM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES, AND TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE RESOURCE LEVELS DIRECTED TOWARD SPECIFIC PLANNED PROGRAMS. STAKEHOLDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AS A TOOL TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE AND SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM. STAKEHOLDERS ARE ALSO PART OF FUND DEVELOPMENT AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. IV.

ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: IN THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA-LINCOLN (UNL) INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES (IANR), WE ARE ALL ABOUT PEOPLE AND THE FOOD, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAT SUSTAIN THEM. IANR INNOVATION IN RESEARCH, TEACHING, AND EXTENSION EDUCATION PLACES NEBRASKA ON THE LEADING EDGE OF FOOD PRODUCTION, ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, HUMAN NUTRITION, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT. COMPOSED OF THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES AND NATURAL RESOURCES (CASNR), THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH DIVISION (ARD), NEBRASKA EXTENSION, AND THE ARD AND EXTENSION COMPONENTS OF THREE DEPARTMENTS IN THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND HUMAN SCIENCES; IANR IS COMMITTED TO GROWING THE FUTURE OF NEBRASKA'S PEOPLE, BUSINESSES, AND COMMUNITIES. STRATEGIC PLANNING IS INTEGRAL TO IANR'S FUNCTION AS A LAND-GRANT INSTITUTION, AND IT PRIDES ITSELF ON WORKING AS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT ACROSS THE THREE MISSION AREAS. IANR STRIVES TO COMBINE RESEARCH, TEACHING AND EXTENSION IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY, COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT ENCOURAGES THE BEST THINKING AND EXPERTISE FROM ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TO ENSURE NEBRASKA'S COMPETITIVENESS IN A WORLD OF CHANGE AND CHALLENGE. SIX COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE WERE FORMED IN 2011. FACULTY FROM ALL IANR DEPARTMENTS CAME TOGETHER AND RATHER THAN FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT NEEDS, THEY AGREED TO FOCUS ON AREAS OF STRENGTH THAT THEY FELT THE INSTITUTION AS A WHOLE COULD BUILD UPON. IN 2020 FURTHER INTEGRATION OF MISSION AREAS AND DISCIPLINES LAUNCHED IN THE FORM OF IANR HUBS. HUBS FACILITATED AN INFORMAL CONNECTION AMONG PEOPLE AND UNITS WITHIN IANR THAT FURTHER LEVERAGE INSTITUTE CAPACITY TO DELIVER ON OUR MISSION. THAT TYPE OF BOLD COLLABORATION AND THINKING IS WHAT WAS NEEDED TO PROPEL NEBRASKA FORWARD. WE ARE STRIVING TO EXCEL IN THESE AREAS AND INVITE COLLABORATORS AND LEARNERS TO BECOME A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. WE WELCOME FEEDBACK, IDEAS, ENGAGEMENT, AND SUPPORT IN OUR ONGOING ENDEAVOR TO MAKE IANR A GLOBAL LEADER IN THESE KEY AREAS. IANR COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE: COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES DRIVERS OF ECONOMIC VITALITY FOR NEBRASKA HEALTH HUMANS HEALTHY SYSTEMS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND NATURAL RESOURCES SCIENCE LITERACY STRESS BIOLOGY IANR HUBS: NEBRASKA INTEGRATED BEEF SYSTEMS RURAL PROSPERITY NEBRASKA WATER AND INTEGRATED CROPPING SYSTEMS IN 2018 STRATEGIC TWO-WAY DIALOGUE MOVED TO A NEW, HIGHER PLANE AS VISION FOR 2025 WAS IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE NEBRASKA'S COMPETITIVENESS IN A WORLD OF CHANGE AND CHALLENGE. THIS VISIONING PROCESS WAS CREATED TO DETERMINE HOW IANR WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CRITICAL NEED OF DOUBLING THE WORLD'S FOOD SUPPLY IN ORDER TO FEED OVER 9 BILLION PEOPLE; ADDRESS THE SHIFTING CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS; RESPOND TO THE INCREASING NEED FOR ENERGY SOURCES; AND CONSIDER HOW TO HELP INCREASE ECONOMIC INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES AND THUS THE LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR NEBRASKA. IN NEBRASKA, ONE IN FOUR JOBS IS DIRECTLY TIED TO AGRICULTURE OR AGRIBUSINESS, AND THE STATE STRIVES TO INCREASE JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS FIELD OF EXPERTISE. IANR INFORMS AND ENGAGES PARTNERS AND CLIENTELE IN OUR FOCUS AREAS OF FOOD, FUEL, WATER, LANDSCAPES, AND PEOPLE. THESE FIVE FOCUS AREAS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOCIETAL CHALLENGE AREAS OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE (NIFA). FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE NEBRASKA PLANNING PROCESS \"FOOD\" REPRESENTS THE CONTINUUM OF FOOD TO FORK, WHICH INCLUDES PRODUCTION, FOOD SECURITY AND HUNGER, CHILDHOOD OBESITY, NUTRITION AND FOOD SAFETY, AND SCIENCE/FOOD LITERACY. RESILIENT FOOD PRODUCTION AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS REPRESENTS THE PRODUCTIVITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF ALL OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. WATER IS HIGHLIGHTED BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER TO OUR AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE SYSTEMS IN NEBRASKA. FOSTERING HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE REPRESENTS THE WELL-BEING OF CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES AS THEY INTERACT WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT. DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES: THE CAPACITY FUNDING IANR RECEIVES IS ALLOCATED WITHIN TWO KEY, CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS THE ABOVE FOCUS AREAS. 1. RESILIENT FOOD PRODUCTION AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS  THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON USING BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH IN THE LIFE/AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES TO GENERATE KNOWLEDGE CRITICAL TO MAXIMIZING PRODUCTIVITY IN ANIMAL/PLANT AGRICULTURE, ENGINEERING, NATURAL RESOURCES, CLIMATE, AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. RESEARCH EFFORTS SPAN THE BASIC/FUNDAMENTAL TO THE APPLIED, RELATING TO CROP/ANIMAL SYSTEMS, BIOENERGY FEEDSTOCKS, AND THE NATURAL LANDSCAPES IN WHICH THOSE SYSTEMS EXIST. EXTENSION PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO TRANSFER NEW KNOWLEDGE TO PRODUCERS, HELPING THEM OPTIMIZE PRODUCTIVITY WHILE ENSURING FINANCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY OF NEBRASKA'S FARMS/RANCHES. UNDERGRADUATE/GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAMS SUPPORT RESEARCH AND EXTENSION EFFORTS, ENSURING A HIGHLY EDUCATED WORKFORCE ESSENTIAL TO MODERN AGRICULTURE. SCIENCE EMPHASIS AREAS: AGROCLIMATE SCIENCE BIOECONOMY, BIOENERGY AND BIOPRODUCTS ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS 2. FOSTERING HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE  THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON USING BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH IN THE LIFE/AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES TO GENERATE KNOWLEDGE CRITICAL TO MAXIMIZING PRODUCTIVITY IN FOOD SCIENCES; BUSINESS/COMMUNITY VITALITY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; HEALTHY LIVING; AND DEVELOPMENT AND SUCCESS OF YOUNG CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES. RESEARCH EFFORTS SPAN THE BASIC/FUNDAMENTAL TO THE APPLIED/TRANSLATIONAL, RELATING TO NUTRITION/HE ALTH, FOOD SAFETY, EARLY CHILDHOOD, YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, FAMILY STRENGTHENING, AND COMMUNITY CAPACITY BUILDING. EXTENSION PROGRAMS WILL ENGAGE CLIENTELE BY TRANSLATING EXISTING AND NEW RESEARCH TO NEBRASKANS THAT OPTIMIZE PRODUCTIVITY AND LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS. THESE EFFORTS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY UNDERGRADUATE/GRADUATE EDUCATION DESIGNED TO CONTRIBUTE THE STATE'S LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH. SCIENCE EMPHASIS AREAS: EDUCATION AND MULTICULTURAL ALLIANCES FAMILY <(>&<)> CONSUMER SCIENCES FOOD SAFETY HUMAN NUTRITION YOUTH DEVELOPMENT FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL OUTCOMES, WE WELCOME THE REVIEW OF IANR'S ANNUAL REPORT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RESULTS. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: AS NEBRASKA'S RESIDENTS ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES AND STAKEHOLDERS, THERE IS AN ONGOING, TWO-WAY DIALOGUE TO ENSURE THAT IANR'S PRIORITIES REFLECT THE NEEDS OF THE STATE.

THE STATE REPRESENTS A MAJOR REGION OF RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES. ITS 365 MILLION ACRES INCLUDE THE NATION'S LARGEST OIL RESERVES, COAL DEPOSITS AND THE TWO LARGEST NATIONAL FORESTS. THE STATE ALSO CONTAINS AN ARRAY OF MINERAL DEPOSITS, INCLUDING GOLD, ZINC, BORON, MOLYBDENUM AND RARE EARTH MINERALS. ALASKA HAS A DIVERSE GEOGRAPHY THAT OFFERS SOILS FOR PRODUCTION OF FOOD, FIBER AND BIOMASS FUELS AS WELL AS A MULTITUDE OF RECREATIONAL AND TOURISM ACTIVITIES. WATERS SURROUNDING ALASKA'S SHORELINE AND RIPARIAN HABITATS CONTAIN LARGE STOCKS OF SALMON, COD, POLLOCK, HALIBUT, HERRING, CRAB AND SHRIMP THAT SUPPORT THRIVING COMMERCIAL, SPORT AND SUBSISTENCE FISHERIES. ALASKA'S NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY THOUGH RESOURCE INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY EXTRACTIVE IN NATURE. THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS A PREDOMINANT FORCE IN THE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF ANY TEACHING, RESEARCH, EXTENSION AND ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS (UAF) IN GENERAL AND COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE (CES) AND AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY EXPERIMENT STATION (AFES), IN PARTICULAR, MEET THE CHALLENGES OF INCREASING DEMANDS FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, OUTREACH AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT ARE RELEVANT TO SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF ALASKA'S RESOURCES AND BRING COMMUNITY IDEAS TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE'S RESOURCES. ALASKA'S ECONOMY HAS BECOME DEPENDENT UPON REVENUES RELATED TO PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT. TO DIVERSIFY ITS ECONOMY, THE STATE IS MOVING TOWARD NONPETROLEUM NATURAL RESOURCES FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COST-EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE. THE PROGRAMS OF AFES AND CES PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN LINKING THE KNOWLEDGE GENERATED AT THE UNIVERSITY TO MEET THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF ALASKANS. CITIZENS ARE PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH ENGAGEMENT TO INFLUENCE FUTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PRIORITIES. CES DELIVERS THE LATEST RESEARCH FINDINGS, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES TO THE PUBLIC. WHILE ALASKA IMPORTS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FOODS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, GROWERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PRODUCE FRESH MARKET POTATOES, VEGETABLES AND HERBS; FORAGES, GRAINS AND MANUFACTURED LIVESTOCK FEEDS; CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDE BEDDING PLANTS, FLORALS, LANDSCAPE ORNAMENTALS AND SHORT SEASON VEGETABLES; AND A VARIETY OF NICHE MARKET CROPS. LIVESTOCK ENTERPRISES IN ALASKA ARE VARIED IN SIZE AND SPECIES OF ANIMAL IN PRODUCTION. PRODUCERS NEED INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO NORTHERN LATITUDES THAT WILL PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE AN ABUNDANT AND SAFE FOOD SUPPLY. AS THE POPULATION GROWS, MORE LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY PRODUCED FOOD WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE GREATER FOOD SECURITY. MANY ALASKANS LIVE  A SUBSISTENCE LIFESTYLE OR SUPPLEMENT THEIR DIETS WITH FISH AND GAME MEAT. ALASKA ALSO HAS A LARGE MILITARY POPULATION, AND MOST HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PRESERVED GAME MEAT OR FISH. ALASKA HAS ONE OF THE NATION'S HIGHEST RATES OF BOTULISM, SO IT IS IMPERATIVE TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED INFORMATION ON SAFE PRESERVATION OF DIETARY STAPLES. ALASKA ALSO HAS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING SENIOR POPULATIONS, WHO FACES THE CHALLENGE OF REMAINING ACTIVE AND HEALTHY IN A DEMANDING ENVIRONMENT. OTHER CONCERNS THAT DEFINE HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAMMING ARE THE HIGH RATES OF CHILD AND ADULT OBESITY AND DIABETES. INDOOR AIR QUALITY IS ALSO A PARTICULAR ALASKA CONCERN. HIGH ENERGY COSTS REMAIN A CRITICAL ISSUE, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL ALASKA, WHERE FUEL OIL RUNS $8 OR $9 A GALLON. RESEARCH AND OUTREACH WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON NEW AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY, WOOD AND BIOMASS AND ENERGY CONSERVATION. AFES WILL WORK TO PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION TO MANAGE RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY FOR ENHANCING THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE AT HIGH LATITUDES. WHILE FORESTERS, FARMERSAND LAND MANAGERS USE RESEARCH RESULTS, ALL ALASKANS BENEFIT FROM THE WISE USE OF LAND RESOURCES. RESEARCH PROJECTS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM PRODUCERS, INDUSTRIES, AND STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR INFORMATION ON PLANT, ANIMAL AND SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; AND STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND RESILIENCE. EXPERIMENT STATION RESEARCHERS WILL CONTINUE TO PUBLISH RESEARCH IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, BOOKS, AND IN EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETINS, CIRCULARS, NEWSLETTERS, RESEARCH PROGRESS REPORTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PUBLICATIONS. SCIENTISTS WILL ALSO DISSEMINATE THEIR FINDINGS THROUGH CONFERENCES, PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS, WORKSHOPS AND OTHER PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS LIKE WEBSITES AND BLOGS. THE MISSION OF CES IS TO USE RESEARCH-BASED KNOWLEDGE TO EDUCATE, ENGAGE AND SUPPORT THE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES OF ALASKA, CONNECTING THEM WITH THEIR UNIVERSITY. CES PROVIDES FACTUAL AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION WHILE BRINGING ALASKANS' ISSUES AND CHALLENGES TO THE UNIVERSITY. CES IS COMMITTED TO PROMOTING THE SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY OF INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDING PRACTICAL, NONFORMAL EDUCATION, INCLUDING CONFERENCES, WORKSHOPS AND COOPERATIVE WORK WITH COMMUNITY, REGIONAL AND TRIBAL PARTNERS. OUTREACH IS ALSO PROVIDED THROUGH NUMBERED PUBLICATIONS, FACULTY CONSULTATIONS, NEWSLETTERS, BLOGS AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS LIKE FACEBOOK PAGES, YOUTUBE CHANNELS AND TWITTER FEEDS. CES PRIORITIES ADDRESS NATIONAL PRIORITIES BY HELPING FAMILIES, YOUTH AND INDIVIDUALS BE PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY; ENHANCING WORKFORCE PREPARATION AND LIFE SKILLS; STRENGTHENING FOOD SAFETY AND SECURITY; AND FOSTERING GREATER ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. PROGRAMMING RESPECTS CULTURAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY AND IS RESPONSIVE TO EMERGING STAKEHOLDER NEEDS AND INTERESTS. PROGRAMS RESULT FROM CLIENT REQUESTS, VARIOUS REGIONAL AND SUBJECT MATTER ADVISORY GROUPS, SURVEYS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND WITH OTHER UNITS WITHIN UAF, THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA STATEWIDE SYSTEM, FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY ARE PLANNED TO CONTINUE. STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDE K-12 STUDENTS, HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS, RESEARCHERS, INDIVIDUALS, BUSINESSES, INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT, NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT ALASKA, THE CIRCUMPOLAR NORTH AND THE NATION. THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF CES AND AFES BRING THE UNIVERSITY TO ALASKANS WHILE BRINGING COMMUNITY CONCERNS AND ISSUES BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY. STATE-DEFINED CRITICAL ISSUE S LINK SPECIFIC PUBLIC NEEDS WITH OUR BROAD MISSION IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE CONCENTRATION OF RESOURCES (MONEY AND PEOPLE) THAT WILL PROMOTE HIGH-QUALITY WORK. CRITICAL ISSUES WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR FACULTY, STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS TO DIRECT CURRENT AND NEW PROGRAMS AND FIND OR RETAIN FACULTY EXPERTISE. THE NEXT SECTION OF THIS SUMMARY EXPLAINS THE RATIONALE DRIVING A FIVE-YEAR FOCUS ON FOUR CRITICAL ISSUES: AGRICULTURE <(>&<)> FOOD SECURITY; NATURAL RESOURCES, ECOSYSTEMS <(>&<)> SUSTAINABLE ENERGY; HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES <(>&<)> COMMUNITIES; AND 4-H <(>&<)> YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT LISTED SEPARATELY, AS IT AFFECTS ALL THE PROGRAM AREAS. AGRICULTURE <(>&<)> FOOD SECURITY: ALASKA IMPORTS OVER 90 PERCENT OF FOODS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CONSUMED IN THE STATE. GROWERS' PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY FOR IN-STATE CONSUMPTION AND USE, INCLUDING FRESH MARKET POTATOES, FORAGES, GRAINS AND OTHER LIVESTOCK FEEDS, GREENHOUSE FLOWERS AND VEGETABLES AND A VARIETY OF \"NICHE MARKET\" CROPS AND PRODUCTS. COMMERCIAL HORTICULTURE INCLUDES ORNAMENTALS, GREENHOUSE OPERATIONS, TURF MANAGEMENT, LAWN MAINTENANCE AND SOD PRODUCTION. PROPER KNOWLEDGE AND PLANNING OF SOIL-DISTURBING ACTIVITIES CAN PREVENT MAJOR IMPACTS ON OTHER RESOURCES. ANIMAL ENTERPRISES IN ALASKA INCLUDE DAIRY, BEEF, SWINE, REINDEER, POULTRY AND NONTRADITIONAL LIVESTOCK SUCH AS MUSKOX, ELK AND BISON. AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND OUTREACH WILL ADDRESS AR EAS OF ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, HOME ANIMAL PRODUCTION, AGRONOMIC CROPS INCLUDING OIL SEEDS AND COVER CROPS, AND HOME AND COMMERCIAL VEGETABLE PRODUCTION. AGRICULTURAL SOILS, FERTILIZER AND COMPOST RESEARCH AND OUTREACH ARE ALSO PART OF THIS PROGRAM AREA. OUR STATEWIDE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) EDUCATION PROGRAM HAS OPERATED SINCE 1981 ASSISTING INDIVIDUALS TO UNDERSTAND INVASIVE PESTS AND CONTROL OPTIONS. AGRICULTURE OUTREACH INCLUDES THE PRIMARY AREAS OF ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HEALTH, HORTICULTURE, SOIL SCIENCE AND AGROFORESTRY. AS ALASKA EXPANDS ITS IN-STATE CONSUMPTION AND EXPORT MARKETS, PRODUCERS WILL REQUIRE INCREASING ACCESS TO RESEARCH-DERIVED INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO NORTHERN LATITUDE ENVIRONMENTS AND KNOWLEDGE APPLIED FROM RESEARCH IN OTHER STATES. NATURAL RESOURCES, ECOSYSTEMS <(>&<)> SUSTAINABLE ENERGY: COMMUNITIES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON ALASKA'S NATURAL RESOURCES FOR VIABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. POLICIES TO SUSTAIN THISGROWTH THAT MIRROR SOCIOLOGICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WILL BE CRITICAL. MAJOR ALASKA RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE NOW CENTERED IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRIES. HEADQUARTERS FOR THESE INDUSTRIES ARE LOCATED IN THE URBAN CENTERS WHERE THERE IS ACCESS TO VARIOUS TRANSPORTATION AND ADVANCED COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, URBAN COMMUNITIES LACK INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENGAGE IN VALUE-ADDED ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD ENHANCE DEVELOPMENT OF NONPETROLEUM INDUSTRY. ADDITIONALLY, THESE EFFORTS SHOULD PROVIDE UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN RURAL AREAS REAL OPTIONS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. OUTREACH WILL ADDRESS STAKEHOLDER NEEDS FOR UNBIASED, SCIENCE-BASED INFORMATION ABOUT NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN FORESTRY, MINING, WATER, RECREATION AND ALTERNATIVE, SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SOURCES. ALASKA'S FOREST AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCE POTENTIAL FOR BIOENERGY PRODUCTION IS IMMENSE BUT REQUIRES MORE RESEARCH. THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF ALASKA'S FORESTS IS UNDER-REALIZED IN TIMBER AND NONTIMBER PRODUCTS. THE FOREST ECOSYSTEM AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS CAN PLAY A ROLE IN DIVERSIFYING THE ECONOMY OF ALASKA. CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH AND SURVIVAL OF RESOURCE BIODIVERSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CENTRAL ISSUE IN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN ALASKA AND ELSEWHERE. AS ENERGY CONTINUES TO BECOME A GROWING CONCERN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THE BOREAL FOREST HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS NECESSARY FOR FUEL ALTERNATIVES TO PETROLEUM AND COAL. HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES <(>&<)> COMMUNITIES: CONCERNS FOR ALASKANS INCLUDE HIGH RATES OF OBESITY AND RECURRING FOOD SAFETY ISSUES SUCH AS BOTULISM. THE STATE RECORDS FREQUENT EARTHQUAKES, WHICH UNDERSCORES A NEED FOR EMERGENCY PREPARATION AS WELL AS PERIODIC RADON TESTING RELATED TO GROUND SHIFTS. FOOD SAFETY PROGRAMMING WILL ENCOMPASS FOOD PRESERVATION, SAFETY, PREPARATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION WILL UTILIZE VARIOUS RESOURCES AND STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT ALL TYPES OF FOODS, INCLUDING INDIGENOUS FOODS, ARE PROPERLY STORED, PREPARED AND PRESERVED SO THAT FOOD IS SAFE FOR CONSUMPTION. HOME AND ENERGY EXTENSION PROGRAMMING ADDRESSES INDOOR AIR QUALITY, HOME MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, ENERGY USE AND CONSERVATION. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IMPACTS SUCH AREAS AS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES RESPONDING TO NATURAL AND MAN-MADE DISASTERS. NUTRITION OUTREACH WILL ADDRESS CHILDHOOD OBESITY WITH NUTRITION EDUCATION IN AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS IN COMMUNITY VENUES AS WELL AS COOKING PROGRAMS THAT EMPHASIZE PREPARING HEALTHY FOODS. TRAINING IS CONDUCTED WITH YOUTH, TEACHERS, 4-H LEADERS, YOUTH GROUP ORGANIZERS, PARENTS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO PROVIDE TECHNIQUES FOR WORKING DIRECTLY WITH YOUTH IN THE AREA OF NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. 4-H <(>&<)> YOUTH DEVELOPMENT: RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YOUTH NEED SUSTAINED, HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITH ADULTS IN ORDER TO THRIVE. CES WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT THROUGH EDUCATION WITH A FOCUS ON LEADERSHIP SKILLS, USING THE 4-H MISSIONMAND ATES OF SCIENCE, CITIZENSHIP AND HEALTHY LIVING. ORGANIZED 4-H CLUBS, SCHOOL ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS, AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITIES AND SUMMER CAMPS WILL CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT GOALS. THE FOCUS OF ALASKA'S 4-H PROGRAM IS SUPPORTING THE HEALHTY MATURATION OF YOUTH FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADULTHOOD. TRAINING THROUGHOUT THE STATE, PROMOTING LIFE SKILLS AND USING THE 4-H MODEL OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, WILL BE THE FOUNDATION OF ALL YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING. DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THE STATE'S APPROPRIATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. DURING THE FY19 LEGISLATIVE SESSION, ALASKA'S GOVERNOR PROPOSED A 41 PERCENT CUT TO THE STATE APPROPRIATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA. IN GENERAL, THERE IS A GREAT CONCERN WITH THE AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE UNIVERSITY THIS YEAR AND THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WITH THIS IN MIND, CES AND AFES HAVE HAD TO ADJUST THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF HOW MANY FACULTY AND STAFF THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SALARY FUNDING FOR UNTIL THERE IS AN INCREASE IN STATE FUNDING. THUS, THE FTE PROJECTIONS IN THE NEXT SECTION SHOW A GRADUAL REDUCTION DURING THE POW CYCLE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AK", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "569c2448-3ce6-f2a2-0e2b-5d95a748f551-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLBCXXXXG021_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736018, "Award ID": "NI23SLBCXXXXG020", "Award Amount": 3645467.13, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "SMITH-LEVER B <(>&<)> C ABSTRACT NDSU EXTENSION THE MISSION OF NDSU EXTENSION IS TO CREATE LEARNING PARTNERSHIPS THAT HELP ADULTS AND YOUTH ENHANCE THEIR LIVES AND COMMUNITIES. NDSU EXTENSION ACTIVITIES CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING CROP PRODUCTIVITY, ADAPTING NEW CROPS; ADAPTING CROPPING SYSTEMS, RESPONDING TO EVOLVING PEST ISSUES, IMPROVING SOIL MANAGEMENT; ASSISTING WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOFUELS AS SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SOURCES; AND TRAINING FAMILIES ON NUTRITION AND WELLNESS TO ADDRESS CHILDHOOD OBESITY. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON STATE IDENTIFIED NEEDS IN THE AREAS OF AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES; 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT; FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES; AND COMMUNITY, LEADERSHIP AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. NDSU EXTENSION CONTRIBUTES IN THESE AREAS BY PROVIDING TRANSFORMATIONAL EDUCATION AND CREATING/MAINTAINING PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE, REGION AND NATION. OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREMIER LIFETIME EDUCATION NETWORK THAT HELPS NORTH DAKOTANS IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. AS THE ISSUES FACING THEM BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX, NDSU EXTENSION WILL CONTINUE TO MEET PEOPLE'S NEEDS AS THEY ADAPT TO THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. 1. COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE TO SUPPORT AMERICA'S WORKING LANDS, NATURAL RESOURCES, AND COMMUNITIES DESCRIPTION - SUPPLYING FOOD TO THE WORLD'S POPULATION ACCOUNTS FOR GREENHOUSE GASES RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE, MUCH OF IT FROM THE LOSS OF CARBON CONTENT FROM SOILS CONVERTED TO AGRICULTURE. IN ADDITION, POOR GRAZING MANAGEMENT AND CROP PRODUCTION PRACTICES CAN MULTIPLY COSTS TO LANDS USED FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, RECREATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN THE ENVIRONMENT IS IMPAIRED, LANDOWNERS INCUR LOSSES TO FORAGE PRODUCTION, CROP YIELDS AND WATER QUALITY, QUALITY OF LIFE OF FACTORS (LIKE WILDLIFE AND AESTHETICS) ARE REDUCED, FOOD PRODUCTION AND SECURITY IS JEOPARDIZED, AND CLIMATE CHANGE MAY BE EXACERBATED. FURTHER, ONCE THE ENVIRONMENT IS COMPROMISED OR LOST, RECLAIMING THE ORIGINAL ENVIRONMENT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY. PREVENTATIVE PRACTICES THAT PROACTIVELY REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT (AND STIGMA) OF AGRICULTURE AND ENERGY ON CLIMATE CHANGE ARE CRITICAL. OPTIMIZED AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES CAN BE PRODUCTIVE, SUSTAINABLE, AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE IMPACT OF FOOD PRODUCTION AND ENERGY USE ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

INTENDED BENEFICIARIES - FARMERS, RANCHERS, AGRICULTURAL PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. 3. FOSTER AN EQUITABLE AND COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE FOR ALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS DESCRIPTION - ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS IMPACTING CROP AND LIVESTOCK PRICES CHANGE DAILY. UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG KEY SUPPLY AND DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS, GEO-POLITICAL FACTORS, AND PRICE MOVEMENTS IS CRUCIAL FOR MAKING SOUND MARKETING DECISIONS. A LARGE VOLUME OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FROM AGRICULTURAL PRESS, NATIONAL MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH IMPACT AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY PRICES. IN RECENT YEARS, PRICE VOLATILITY HAS INCREASED RISK, BUT HAS ALSO CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR FLEXIBLE MARKETING PLANS WITH PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN PLACE. INFORMED MARKETING DECISIONS ENSURE A MORE EQUITABLE AND COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE FOR ALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS. THIS HAS POSITIVE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRIBUSINESSES, COMMUNITIES AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SUPPORT THEM, BUT ALSO FOR CONSUMERS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY FOOD AND FIBER PRICES. ACTIVITIES - FACE-TO-FACE AND VIRTUAL PRESENTATIONS DISCUSSING CURRENT MARKET SITUATION/OUTLOOK AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. MULTI-DAY WORKSHOPS DEMONSTRATING ALTERNATIVE MARKETING TOOLS AND THE IMPACTS OF SELECTED MARKETING STRATEGIES. DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES SHORT TERM -CROP AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS, AGRIBUSINESSES, PUBLIC AGENCIES, EXTENSION AGENTS, POPULAR PRESS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS AND GEO-POLITICAL FORCES AFFECTING CROP AND LIVESTOCK PRICES. STAKEHOLDERS HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF ALTERNATIVE MARKETING TOOLS, AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS, AND WHICH TOOLS CAN BE USED TO BALANCE RISK EXPOSURE AND PRICING OPPORTUNITIES. INDICATORS - REPORTED INCREASES IN LEARNING AMONG STAKEHOLDERS. INCREASED REQUESTS AND UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES AS REPORTED BY STAKEHOLDERS, AGRICULTURAL MEDIA AND OTHERS. AN INCREASE AND MORE STABILITY IN PRODUCER PROFITS WILL RESULT DUE TO EFFECTIVE MARKETING AND UTILIZATION OF PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS.  MEDIUM TERM -STAKEHOLDERS (FARMERS, RANCHERS, LENDERS, ETC.)

LONG TERM -CROP AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS EXPERIENCE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT, POSITIVELY IMPACTING COMMUNITIES AND CITIZENS IN AND BEYOND NORTH DAKOTA.  INDICATORS - PRODUCERS WILL OPERATE PROFITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE FARMING AND RANCHING OPERATIONS WITH REDUCED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO YEARLY FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICES AND RISK. A MORE DIVERSE AND EXPANDING RURAL ECONOMIC BASE CONTINUES TO EVOLVE IN NORTH DAKOTA. MORE INFORMED CONSUMERS ARE PURCHASING A WIDE VARIETY OF EFFICIENTLY AND LOCALLY (ND AND USA) PRODUCED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.   INTENDED BENEFICIARIES - FARMERS, RANCHERS, AGRICULTURAL PROFESSIONALS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. 4. PROVIDE ALL AMERICANS SAFE, NUTRITIOUS FOOD DESCRIPTION - OBESITY, POOR NUTRITION, AND LIMITED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CONCERNS. ACCORDING TO THEU.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC), NORTH DAKOTA'S ADULT OBESITY RATE IS 33.1 PERCENT, UP FROM 21 PERCENT IN 2000. ADDITIONALLY, 10.5 PERCENT OF NORTH DAKOTA YOUTH, 10-17, ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. POOR HEALTH DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS MINORITY AND LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS. CERTAIN POPULATIONS, INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF LOW-INCOME STATUS, HAVE HIGHER RATES OF OBESITY (NHANES). OBESE CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME OBESE ADULTS WITH AN INCREASED RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE AND HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS. PARENTS/CAREGIVERS CAN INFLUENCE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND PREFERENCE FOR HEALTHY BEHAVIORS IN THEIR CHILDREN. ACTIVITIES - EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS (FACE-TO-FACE, VIRTUAL, AND HYBRID), PRESS RELEASES, PUBLICATIONS, FACILITATION, POLICY SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT (PSE) CHANGE INITIATIVES DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES   SHORT TERM - LEARNERS WILL KNOW: STRATEGIES TO SAVE MONEY AND TIME (I.E.

THEY WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND COLLABORATIVELY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS IN ALL 95 COUNTIES AND TO SERVE THE STATES 6.9 MILLION PEOPLE. THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE IS BASED IN KNOXVILLE AND SERVES AS THE STATES 1862 INSTITUTION. IT INCLUDES THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT EXTENSION) AND THE TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (UT AGRESEARCH). BASED IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY (TSU) IS THE STATES 1890 INSTITUTION; IT INCLUDES THE TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. THIS PLAN OF WORK REPRESENTS THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF UT EXTENSION, UT AGRESEARCH, TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM, AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. AGRICULTURE IS INTEGRAL TO TENNESSEES ECONOMY AND CULTURE. ALMOST ONE OF EVERY EIGHT TO NINE DOLLARS GENERATED IN THE STATE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE OR AN INDUSTRY THAT GENERATES PRODUCTS FROM A NATURAL RESOURCE - MORE THAN $79.3 BILLION ANNUALLY. THE STATES AGRICULTURAL AND RELATED EXPORTS TOTALED $2.2 BILLION IN 2021, UP $325 MILLION OR 17% WHEN COMPARED TO 2020. TENNESSEE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN ALL MAJOR COMMODITY CATEGORIES IN 2021. FARM RECEIPTS TOTALED $3.6 BILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 65.5% OF THIS VALUE COMING FROM CROPS AND 34.5% FROM ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC SUCCESSES OF TENNESSEE AGRICULTURE, 339,400 TENNESSEANS ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED BY AGRICULTURAL OR NATURAL RESOURCE INDUSTRIES, MAKING EFFECTIVE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS CRITICAL. TENNESSEES LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS CONDUCT RESEARCH AND PROVIDE EXTENSION OUTREACH IN FIVE KEY AREAS TO ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THE STATE: SUPPORTING FOOD, FIBER, AND ENERGY SYSTEMS; ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; ENRICHING OUR ECONOMY; DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE; AND STRENGTHENING OUR HEALTH. RESEARCH PROJECTS PROVIDE NEW KNOWLEDGE TO HELP STAKEHOLDERS ADDRESS ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEM. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES SHARE THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ULTIMATELY TO RESULT IN A CHANGE IN ACTION OR CONDITION. EXTENSION WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING NEEDS CITIZENS AND AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS ACROSS THE STATE. HEALTH ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE TOP CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. EXTENSION WILL STRENGTHEN HEALTH PROGRAMMING BY OFFERING THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR IMPROVING DIETARY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR LIMITED-RESOURCE TENNESSEANS. EXTENSION LIVESTOCK AND FORAGE PROGRAMS STRENGTHEN OUR EXTENSION AND RESEARCH FOR THE STATES LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS, RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL WILL JOINTLY IMPLEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH IN HAY SCHOOLS, LATE GESTATION NUTRITION, MARKETING, FORAGE TESTING, AND STOCKPILED FORAGES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION HAS DEVELOPED PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN AND PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRODUCERS. THE UT CENTER FOR FARM MANAGEMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS IN 2022. THE CENTER FACILITATES EXTENSION, TEACHING, AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS ON FARM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. THE CENTER WILL FOCUS ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF TENNESSEE PRODUCERS AND ENHANCING LONG-TERM PROFITABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURE ENTERPRISES. THROUGH THE CROPS PRODUCTION SYSTEMS EXTENSIONS PROVIDE DEMONSTRATION AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT BENEFITS PRODUCERS. THE CROP VARIETY TRIALS FOR CORN GRAIN, SILAGE, AND SOYBEANS AS WELL AS PRODUCER EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR CORN, SOYBEANS, COTTON, WHEAT, AND TOBACCO PRODUCTION ARE KEY AREAS. THE CONSUMER ECONOMICS PROGRAM HELPS FAMILIES INCREASE SAVINGS, DECREASE DEBT, AND FINANCIALLY PLAN. THE ON MY OWN AND 4-H WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED FOR YOUTH AND ADULTS THAT PROVIDE NEEDED SKILLS, TRAININGS, AND EXPERIENCES TO PARTICIPANTS. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OF TOP PRIORITY FOREXTENSION. EXTENSION CONTINUES DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE AND PROVIDE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE NEXT CHAPTER PROGRAM IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND TENNESSEE 4-H. IN CREATING THIS PROGRAM, WE WANT TO CREATE AN EARLY DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT SKILLS ARE NECESSARY FOR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BOTH THEIR SECONDARY AND POSTSECONDARY PLANS. 4-H CONTINUES PROGRAMING ON HONING STEM AND CITIZENSHIP/LEADERSHIP SKILLS. UT AGRESEARCH CONDUCTS RESEARCH WITHIN ITS EIGHT ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND SEVEN PHYSICAL CENTERS, AND AT TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS (REC) LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE UNITS HELP DRIVE PLANNED RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND FACILITATE FACULTY RESEARCH PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO A DECADE OF EXCELLENCE: TEN-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR UTIA, 2018-2028, AGRESEARCH OPERATES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF ITS 2021-2024 AGRESEARCH STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN WITH THE OBJECTIVES TO BALANCE A PORTFOLIO OF INTEGRATED, INTER-DISCIPLINARY PROGRAMS, CULTIVATVESTOCK FARMING (PLF). THE PROGRAM INCORPORATES BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL MANAGEMENT PROJEC TS THAT ULTIMATELY WILL CONTRIBUTE INFORMATION TO REFINE STRATEGIES THAT OFFER CARBON REDUCTIONS OVER TODAY'S AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS. AGRESEARCH IS REALIGNING THE CAPABILITIES AT TWO OF ITS TEN REC TO FACILITATE PLF INITIATIVE. THE LITTLE RIVER ANIMAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT PLANS TO HAVE MILKING ROBOTS IN OPERATION BY LATE FALL 2022, AND THE MIDDLE TENNESSEE REC IS RETOOLING TO SUPPORT PRECISION BEEF AND POULTRY PRODUCTION RESEARCH. ALSO, EXPANDED ACTIVITY IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE WILL RESPOND TO CONCERNS OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION. THE TRANSFORMATIONAL AGRICULTURAL GENOMICS AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY PROGRAM WILL ADVANCE ANIMAL AND PLANT-BASED PRODUCTIVITY. ALTHOUGH EARLY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT, THE INITIATIVE ALREADY ENGAGES FACULTY TO ADVANCE STATE-OF-THE-ART SCIENCE TO DESIGN CROPS THAT ARE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. FINALLY, THE BIOECONOMY ADVANCEMENT INITIATIVE IS AN ESTABLISHED INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABLE FUELS, CHEMICALS, AND MATERIALS. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IS EXPANDING RESEARCH CAPABILITIES IN SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AGGRESSIVE GRAND CHALLENGE GOALS ANNOUNCED BY THE WHITE HOUSE. MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PROCESSES TENNESSEE EXTENSION PROGRAMS FUNDED BY SMITH-LEVER OR NARETPA SECTION 1444 AND 1445 REQUIRE A MERIT REVIEW PROCESS. A PANEL OF EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS, PROGRAM LEADERS AND SCHOLARS FROM FOUR STATES REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TENNESSEE EXTENSION MERIT REVIEW CRITERIA. CRITERIA INCLUDES ASSESSING NEEDS, DELIVERY METHODS, IMPLEMENTATION STEPS, EVALUATION, ENSURING DIVERSITY AND DEFINED OUTCOMES. UT AND TSU COORDINATE MERIT REVIEW PROCESSES. STATE EXTENSION SPECIALISTS PROPOSE PLANNED PROGRAMS. ALL PROPOSED PROGRAMS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY A REVIEW TEAM OF UT EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS AND SPECIALISTS. UT AGRESEARCH WILL UTILIZE THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE IT HAS PROVEN TO BE BOTH EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. HATCH REGULAR AND HATCH/MULTI-STATE RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERGO A REVIEW PROCESS FOR MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS, AND TO ENSURE ALIGNMENT WITH ESTABLISHED RESEARCH PRIORITIES. THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR HATCH REGULAR RESEARCH PROJECTS BEGINS INFORMALLY WITH DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PROJECT DIRECTOR, COLLEAGUES, THE DEPARTMENT HEAD, AND, IF APPLICABLE, AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS (IF FIELD WORK IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT). A REVIEW PANEL OF THREE SCIENTISTS THEN EVALUATES THE PROPOSAL FOR CLARITY, TECHNICAL RELEVANCE, AND SCIENTIFIC MERIT. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR MAKES ANY NECESSARY REVISIONS AND SUBMITS THE PROPOSAL TO THE DEPARTMENT HEAD FOR REVIEW. IF APPROVED, THE DEAN/DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH THEN CONDUCTS A FINAL EVALUATION AND ENDORSES THE PROPOSAL FOR SUBMISSION TO NIFA. HATCH/MULTI-STATE PROJECTS GO THROUGH A COMPARATIVELY MORE EXTENSIVE REVIEW AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL, SO THE INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS IS ABBREVIATED. THE FACULTY MEMBER OFFICIALLY JOINS AMULTI-STATE PROJECT AFTER CONSULTING WITH COLLEAGUES AND, IF APPLICABLE, THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR THEN SUBMITS A PROPOSAL REFLECTING THE UT COMPONENT DIRECTLY TO THE ASSOCIATE DEAN/ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT. ONCE THE REVIEW IS COMPLETE AND ANY NECESSARY CHANGES ARE MADE, THE RESEARCHER SUBMITS THE PROJECT TO NIFA. STAKEHOLDER INPUT UT EXTENSION PURSUED MULTIPLE DATA COLLECTIONS FOR THIS PLAN OF WORK. ALL 95 COUNTIES HAVE LOCAL EXTENSION ADVISORY GROUPS THAT PROVIDE ONGOING STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE UT-TSU EXTENSION STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL REVIEWS AND UPDATES PLANS BI-ANNUALLY. EXTENSIVE STRATEGIC PLAN ACTIVITIES ALSO INFORMED THIS PLAN. EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND STATE AGENCY LEADERS PARTICIPATED IN SURVEYS, LISTENING SESSIONS AND FOCUS GROUPS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW EXTENSION COULD ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. BASED ON THIS INPUT, THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL IDENTIFIED PLAN PRIORITIES. NEW STATE ACTION AGENDAS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS PRIORITIES. PLANS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE PROGRESS AND MAKE CHANGES. UT AGRESEARCH CONTINUES TO SEEK STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THROUGH SEVERAL MEANS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR TO DISCUSS AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES, UTIA PROGRAM PRIOR ITIES, AND HOW UTIA, INCLUDING UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION, MAY RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES. SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE TENNESSEE FARM BUREAU, AND SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE TENNESSEE STATE GOVERNMENT ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF COMMON RESEARCH INTERESTS. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS SERVE THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS AT THE INVITATION OF THE DEPARTMENT HEAD AND CENTER DIRECTOR, RESPECTIVELY, TO PROVIDE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK ANDTO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES. FACULTY HELP DRIVE THE UT AGRESEARCH AGENDA BY REMAINING ABREAST OF EMERGING RESEARCH AND ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, PROGRAM LEADERS WITH STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING AGENCIES, THE PUBLIC, AND AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. ADDITIONALLY, THE UT SYSTEM IS COMPLETING A SURVEY THAT WENT STATEWIDE REGARDING PUBLIC INPUT INTO THE GRAND CHALLENGES FACING TENNESSEE. THIS WAS A UT SYSTEM EFFORT, BUT UT EXTENSION AND UT AGRESEARCH ASSISTED IN SHARING THE SURVEY ACROSS TENNESSEE AND THE RESULTS WILL CERTAINLY ADD TO THE INFORMATION WE USE TO DETERMINE DIRECTIONS FOR OUR WORK. UT AND TSU EXTENSION WILL EMPLOY THEIR EXTENSIVE, STATEWIDE NETWORK OF ADVISORY GROUPS FOR STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL PROVIDES INPUT AND DIRECTION FOR STATEWIDE INITIATIVES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION AGENTS WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON INVOLVING YOUTH AND OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES. ALL OF TENNESSEE'S 95 COUNTIES HAVE A COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE OF SEVEN LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, NOMINATED BY THE COUNTY MAYOR AND APPROVED BY MAJORITY VOTE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSION. EVERY COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEETS FOUR TIMES ANNUALLY, AND THEIR DUTIES INCLUDE INPUT INTO HIRING DECISIONS, LOCAL FUNDING, AND LOCAL PROGRAMMING. UT AGRESEARCH IMPLEMENTS SEVERAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS FOR INPUT. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE STATE GOVERNMENT, AND THE COMMUNITY. IT HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP ON RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION ISSUES. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS ARE COMPRISED OF THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE AND DEANS, REPRESENTATIVES FROM TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY GROUPS, AND CLIENTELE SERVED BY UTIA PROGRAMS. UTIA PERSONNEL NOMINATE THE COMMODITY GROUP AND CLIENTELE MEMBERS. EACH OFTHE THREE REGIONAL ADVISORY GROUPS ELECTS A CHAIR TO GUIDE MEETINGS. IN ADDITION, UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. AS NEW PRIORITIES ARISE, THESE GROUPS SEEK OUT ONE ANOTHER TO DISCUSS COMMON RESEARCH NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS FOR THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS' AND GROUPS' RELEVANT BACKGROUND, EXPERTISE, AND COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. UT AGRESEARCH FACULTY REGULARLY INTERACT WITH THEIR PEERS AT PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND THROUGH JOINT PROJECT VENTURES. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS ENCOURAGE FACULTY TO MEET WITH PROGRAM LEADERS AT STATE AND NATIONAL FUNDING AGENCIES TO DISCUSS RESEARCH PRIORITIES. ADDITIONALLY, FACULTY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET WITH THE PUBLIC DURING AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER FIELD DAY EVENTS. TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT/TSU) AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS ARE TRAINED IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES AND HOW TO SELECT INDIVIDUALS FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES. COMMUNITY LEADERS SELECTED FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSITIES (I.E., GENDER, AGE, RACIAL/ETHNIC, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, EDUCATIONAL, ETC.) OF THE COUNTY OR AREA SERVED. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE CONDUCTS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR (SPECIFIC TO UT EXTENSION). EXTENSION AGENTS RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PAST AND CURRENT EXTENSION PROGRAMS; AND THEY RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT USED EXTENSION TO SERVE ON LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND PARTICIPATE IN OPEN LISTENING SESSIONS. EXTENSION AGENTS ALSO CONDUCT SURVEYS ON PLANNED PROGRAM AREAS. UT AGRESEARCH COLLECTS INPUT THROUGH REGULAR CONTACT WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE AND THE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR. THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE RESPONDS TO ANY ISSUES RAISED, AND, AS APPROPRIATE, MAY DELEGATEACTION TO THE DEANS/DIRECTORS OF UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS MEET WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THEY HAVE FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS WITH THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT HEADS AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS WITH THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER DIRECTORS MONTHLY; COLLECTIVELY THEY MEET ONCE PER YEAR. THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS MEET WITH THEIR ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS ANNUALLY AND SHARE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WITH AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY AS APPROPRIATE. FACULTY ATTEND PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND READ SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND POPULAR PRESS ARTICLES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. DEPARTMENTS HOLD MONTHLY FACULTY MEETINGS WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS WITH PEERS AND THEIR DEPARTMENT HEAD. STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES AT LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND STATEWIDE LEVEL MONITOR AND ADJUST DEPLOYMENT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, THE OPINIONS FROM MANY TENNESSEANS, INCLUDING DECISION-MAKERS, CLIENTELE, PARTNERS,AND VOLUNTEERS WERE CONSIDERED. MORE THAN 120 STAKEHOLDERS AND 490 UT EXTENSION EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATED IN THE REGIONAL AND CAMPUS LISTENING SESSIONS. THE PLANNING EFFORT ALSO INCLUDED AN ONLINE SURVEY COMPONENT. UT EXTENSION WILL ADDRESS THE INCREASING URBANIZATION AND A LOSS OF FARMLAND IN THE STATE ARE CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. OUR NURSERY, FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTION PROGRAMS WILL PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON PLANT, PEST, AND SOIL DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES.

UNHCE SUPPORTS FIVE PROGRAM TEAMS, INCLUDING FOOD AND AGRICULTURE; NATURAL RESOURCES; HEALTH AND WELL-BEING; EDUCATION AND 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT; AND COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. UNHCE 'S LEADERSHIP CONSISTS OF THE DEAN AND DIRECTOR; ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS; ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS; FIVE PROGRAM TEAM LEADERS; MARKETING DIRECTOR; PUBLIC AFFAIRS MANAGER; AND PROJECT MANAGER OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. PROGRAM STAFF, KNOWN AS EXTENSION EDUCATORS, ARE LOCATED ON UNH CAMPUSES AND IN TEN COUNTY EXTENSION OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EACH COUNTY OFFICE IS SUPPORTED BY AN ADVISORY COUNCIL CONSISTING OF 12 CITIZEN VOLUNTEERS, A COUNTY COMMISSIONER, AND COUNTY DELEGATION MEMBER. ONE EXTENSION EDUCATOR IN EACH COUNTY IS APPOINTED COUNTY OFFICE ADMINISTRATOR FOR A PERIOD OF 2 TO 4 YEARS. THEY WORK WITH THE COUNTY ADVISORY COUNCIL TO DETERMINE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF COUNTY RESIDENTS AND USHER AN ANNUAL BUDGET FOR THE COUNTY EXTENSION OFFICE THROUGH PASSAGE. FIFTEEN VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS (WITH 4,543 VOLUNTEERS IN 2021) HELP EXTENSION EDUCATORS EXTEND THEIR WORK IN COMMUNITIES. UNHCE'S NEWEST VOLUNTEER PROGRAM, MASTER WELLNESS VOLUNTEERS, PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ADULTS TO ENGAGE IN LEARNING SESSIONS FOCUSED ON CREATING COMMUNITY CHANGE FOR HEALTH. UNHCE UNDERWENT SEVERAL INTERNAL CHANGES IN THE PAST YEAR. STAFF ADAPTED TO THE UNH'S RESTRUCTURING OF BUSINESS SERVICES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENTS AND A NEW REPORTING SYSTEM (PEARS). MANY STAFF STRUGGLED WHILE RETURNING TO WORK AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR WORKING AT HOME DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. AFFORDABLE, HIGH-QUALITY CHILDCARE AND HOUSING ARE CITED AS GRAND CHALLENGES FOR STAFF, AS WELL AS MANY CONSTITUENTS SERVED BY UNHCE. RETIREMENTS AND RESIGNATIONS RESULTED IN 24 SEARCHES FOR NEW STAFF IN 2021 AND 26 SEARCHES IN 2022. LEADERSHIP MADE A STRATEGIC DECISION TO SUNSET THE YOUTH AND FAMILY PROGRAM AND REPLACE IT WITH TWO SMALLER PROGRAM TEAMS - EDUCATION AND 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THIS CHANGE IS TO MAKE TEAM SIZE MORE MANAGEABLE, ALLOWING PROGRAM TEAM LEADERS TO IMPROVE STAFF ONBOARDING, COACHING, AND TRAINING IN PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION. AT THE TIME OF WRITING, THE ORGANIZATION IS UNDERGOING A STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS. SIXTEEN STAFF ARE WORKING WITH AN EXTERNAL FACILITATOR AND INTERNAL PROJECT MANAGER OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO PLAN SIX PUBLIC INPUT FORUMS TO BE HELD STATEWIDE. THE PURPOSE OF THE FORUMS IS TO HEAR FROM CONSTITUENTS, STAKEHOLDERS, PARTNERS, VOLUNTEERS, AND STAFF ABOUT THE ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES THEY THINK UNHCE SHOULD ADDRESS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. ONCE THE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND SYNTHESIZED, THE LEADERSHIP TEAM WILL CRAFT A STRATEGIC VISION AND PRIORITIES FOR THE ORGANIZATION TO WORK TOWARD IN 2023 TO 2028. UNHCE'S CURRENT PROGRAMS ADDRESS SIX CRITICAL ISSUES: AGRICULTURE; FOOD SAFETY; NUTRITION, HEALTH AND WELLNESS; CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINING NATURAL RESOURCES; RURAL COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND EDUCATION AND 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. CRITICAL ISSUES AND PLANNED EXTENSION ACTIVITIES 1. AGRICULTURE  UNHCE'S FOOD AND AGRICULTURE SPECIALISTS DELIVER EDUCATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ALL RESIDENTS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE STATE'S AGRICULTURAL AND HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRIES, AND THE FOOD SYSTEM. SPECIALISTS PROVIDE CURRENT, RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING TO FARMERS, GARDENERS, AND BUSINESSES. CURRENTLY, UNHCE IMPLEMENTS TEN PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS FOR THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND INTENDS TO HELP INDIVIDUALS MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IN THE PURSUIT OF SUSTAINABLE AND PRODUCTIVE LOCAL AGRICULTURE. THE FOLLOWING ARE CURRENT MAJOR PROJECTS, THEIR TARGET POPULATION AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES. O EDUCATION IN DAIRY AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION: THIS PROGRAM SERVES ALL DAIRIES, REGARDLESS OF SIZE OR MARKET. LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS ARE MOSTLY SMALL FARMS, ALTHOUGH SOME LARGE FARMS ARE ALSO IN OPERATION. BEEF, SWINE, SHEEP, AND CHICKENS MAKE UP THE BULK OF THE LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS IN THE STATE. THE PROGRAM AIMS TO DEVELOP SKILLS IN FARMERS SO THAT THEY MAY USE PROPER BREEDING PRACTICES TO IMPROVE REPRODUCTIVE RATES AND GENE TRANSFER. O IMPLEMENTATION OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES: THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES EDUCATION AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR NH'S SPECIALTY CROPS, AGRONOMIC CROPS, ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, COMMUNITIES, PESTICIDE APPLICATORS, AND PEST DIAGNOSTIC FACILITIES. THE INTENDED OUTCOME IS TO HELP PRODUCERS REDUCE COSTS, INCREASE YIELDS, AND MINIMIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PEST MANAGEMENT. O UTILIZATION OF COVER CROPS AND SOIL HEALTH PRACTICES: THE PROGRAM TARGETS FORAGE CROP PRODUCERS AND VEGETABLE PRODUCERS AND AIMS TO INCREASE THE ACREAGE OF AGRICULTURAL SOILS SOWN TO COVER CROPS AND MANAGED BY CONSERVATION TILLAGE. O NEW CROPS, VARIETIES, AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES IN HORTICULTURAL CROP PRODUCTION: THE PROGRAM AUDIENCE IS HORTICULTURAL CROP PRODUCERS OF VEGETABLE AND BERRY CROPS, TREE FRUIT, BEDDING PLANTS, POTTED PLANTS, AND NURSERY CROPS. THE INTENDED OUTCOME IS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY, PRODUCTIVITY, AND PROFITABILITY, AND MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. O MITIGATION OF LEGAL RISK THROUGH EDUCATION AND AWARENESS: THE PROGRAM AIMS TO HELP AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS OWNERS AND MANAGERS UNDERSTAND HOW TO PROTECT THEIR OPERATIONS THROUGH INSURANCE, SELECT APPROPRIATE BUSINESS STRUCTURES, AND UNDERSTAND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ZONING, SIGNAGE, AND A HOST OF OTHER RULES AND REGULATIONS. O DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH SKILLS AND EXPERIENCES IN AGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE: PROGRAMS TARGET YOUTH FROM ELEMENTARY THROUGH COLLEGE. YOUTH PARTICIPANTS DEVELOP SKILLS AND CAREER PATHS THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO BECOME PRACTITIONERS AND LEADERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. O EDUCATION IN LANDSCAPE BUSINESS AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES: THIS PROGRAM TARGETS LANDSCAPERS AND GARDENERS. PARTICIPANTS OF THIS PROGRAM WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED FOR CAREERS IN LANDSCAPING AND RELATED FIELDS AND WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED CAREER CHOICES HAVING A WIDER VISION OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE. O DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS THROUGH UTILIZATION OF FINANCIAL TOOLS AND ANALYTICS: THE TARGET AUDIENCE INCLUDES THE WHOLE OF NH AGRICULTURE, THUS ALL COMMODITIES, ALL ECONOMIC SCALES, AND ALL AGES OF FARMERS. BUSINESS OWNERS WILL GAIN SKILLS AND MOTIVATION TO UTILIZE FINANCIAL TOOLS AND ANALYTICS TO MAKE DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS. O MITIGATION OF HUMAN RESOURCE RISK THROUGH GOAL SETTING AND STRATEGIC PLANNING: THIS SUITE OF TOPICS IS SUITABLE TO ALL LEVELS AND SCALES OF AGRICULTURAL BUSINESSES FROM START-UPS TO MATURE OPERATIONS, SMALL TO LARGE. PRODUCERS LEARN SKILLS THAT ENABLE THEM TO DEFINE VALUES AND SET GOALS TO GUIDE THEIR BUSINESS PLAN, AND TO ADDRESS ISSUES AFFECTING QUALITY OF LIFE AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS. O IMPLEMENTATION OF BEST MARKETING PRACTICES: THE PROGRAM IS TARGETED TOWARD NON-COMMODITY PRODUCERS WHO SELL DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. PRODUCERS WHO ATTEND BUSINESS PLANNING WORKSHOPS LEARN HOW TO DEVELOP WELL-DESIGNED BUSINESS AND MARKETING PLANS FOR THEIR FARM OPERATIONS.  FOOD SAFETY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL COST OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS IS $681 MILLION WITH A PER-CASE COST ESTIMATE OF $1,892. RESTAURANTS ARE PROJECTED TO RECORD $2.3 BILLION IN SALES BETWEEN 2012 AND 2022. HOWEVER, MORE THAN 63,800 PEOPLE, AND MANY EMPLOYEES HAVE NO OR LIMITED TRAINING IN FOOD SAFETY. THE UNHCE FOOD SAFETY PROGRAM ADDRESSES THESE NEEDS WITH FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION TARGETING EACH SECTOR OF THE FOOD SYSTEM, INCLUDING PRODUCTION, FOODSERVICE, AND CONSUMERS, WITH RESEARCH-BASED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, RESOURCES, AND INFORMATION. FOOD SAFETY PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: O COMMUNITY FOOD SAFETY: UNH EXTENSION'S COMMUNITY FOOD SAFETY PROGRAMS ARE TARGETED TO FOOD HANDLERS WHO PROVIDE FOOD TO THE STATE'S VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THE PROGRAM AIMS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS IN THE AREAS OF PERSONAL HEALTH AND HYGIENE, CLEANING, AND SANITIZING, AND PREVENTING TIME AND TEMPERATURE ABUSE OF FOODS. O FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION FOR FARMS AND PROCESSORS: TARGET AUDIENCES INCLUDE DIRECT TO RETAIL PRODUCERS, PRODUCERS WHO NEED TO COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS, PROCESSORS CREATING A VALUE-ADDED PRODUCT, AND SMALLER OPERATORS WHO FALL UNDER THE NH HOMESTEAD ACT, SELLING LESS THAN $20,000 WORTH OF GOODS. THE PROGRAM INTENDS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF SAFE LOCAL FOOD, CREATE A CULTURE OF FOOD SAFETY, AND BUILD STRONG BUSINESSES.  2. NUTRITION, HEALTH AND WELLNESS  THE HEALTH OF NEW HAMPSHIRE'S POPULATION HAS PROFOUND LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND THE POPULATION'S WELL-BEING. POOR UNDERSTANDING OF NUTRITION, INACTIVE LIFESTYLES, AND SYSTEMS-LEVEL FOOD ACCESS ISSUES HAVE LED TO CHRONIC PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS SUCH AS OBESITY AND DIABETES. ADDITIONALLY, COVID HAS EXACERBATED PRE-EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN NH INCLUDING OPIOID MISUSE, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH, SOCIAL ISOLATION FOR SENIORS AND DIS-PROPORTIONATE SUICIDE RATES FOR THE WHOLE STATE. THESE ISSUES, WHEN NOT PREVENTED AND/OR UNTREATED, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS, LOSS OF WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY, AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE. DATA FROM THE CDC, THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND UNH CARSEY INSTITUTE SUGGESTS THAT IMPORTANT BEHAVIORS SUCH AS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION ARE BELOW RECOMMENDED LEVELS, PARTICULARLY FOR LOWER-INCOME YOUTH AND FAMILIES. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE NEW HAMPSHIRE IS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND FASTEST AGING STATES IN THE COUNTRY, THE NATURAL VULNERABILITY AND DECLINING HEALTH OF AN OLDER POPULATION WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. UNHCE'S HEALTHY AND WELL-BEING PROGRAM AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS, PARTICULARLY WITH POPULATIONS WHO MAY BE SUFFERING INEQUITABLY, SUCH AS LIMITED RESOURCE ADULTS OR YOUTH THATATTEND SCHOOLS WITH 50% OR GREATER FREE AND REDUCED MEAL RATES. OUR STAFF IMPLEMENT PROGRAMMING THAT AIMS TO IMPROVE MODIFIABLE CHRONIC DISEASE RISK FACTORS SUCH AS DIET, PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, AND FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION. EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS ALSO TARGET THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF NH YOUTH AND FAMILIES. DIRECT EDUCATION EFFORTS FOCUS ON (A) IMPROVING DIET AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY-RELATED BEHAVIOR CHANGES BY ENCOURAGING ADHERENCE TO THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS AND (B) PROVIDING RESOURCES TO HELP YOUTH AND ADULTS BETTER MANAGE THEIR OWN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. EFFORTS FOCUSED ON INTERVENTIONS AND COALITION-WORK AT POLICY SYSTEM AND ENVIRONMENTAL (PSE) LEVELS ARE AIMED AT MAKING IT EASIER TO MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES WHERE PARTICIPANTS LIVE, WORK, AND PLAY. THIS MULTILEVEL APPROACH (I.E., PSE + DIRECT EDUCATION) IS MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT SUSTAINED BEHAVIOR CHANGES AND SYSTEMS CHANGES THAT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OUTCOMES. 3. CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINING NATURAL RESOURCES  HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE LAND, WATER, AND WILDLIFE ARE CRITICAL TO NH'S NATURAL RESOURCE-BASED INDUSTRY, TOURISM, RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE EXPERIENCED BY RESIDENTS. CLIMATE CHANGE NOT ONLY THREATENS SEACOAST COMMUNITIES BUT WILL CHALLENGE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND IMPACT FORESTRY PRACTICES AND WILDLIFE STEWARDSHIP EFFORTS. WORKING THROUGH AREAS OF EXPERTISE THAT INCLUDE FOREST AND WILDLIFE STEWARDSHIP, COMMUNITY NATURAL RESOURCE, CITIZEN SCIENCE, AND FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE, STAFF PROVIDE RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE TO PRIVATE LANDOWNERS, NATURAL RESOURCES PROFESSIONALS, LOGGING AND FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY, AGENCIES, MUNICIPALITIES, LOCAL DECISION-MAKERS, RESEARCHERS, SCHOOLS, VOLUNTEERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS. UNHCE'S NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM ENDEAVORS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PERMANENTLY PROTECTED LAND TO PROVIDE HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE; PROTECT WATER QUALITY; MAINTAIN A FOREST-BASED ECONOMY TO DEFINE THE CHARACTER OF NH COMMUNITIES; AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF LAND MANAGED USING GOOD FOREST STEWARDSHIP PRACTICES. 4. RURAL COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  THE COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM SEEKS TO CULTIVATE CIVIC LEADERS, FOSTER PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY DECISION-MAKING, AND BUILD THE CAPACITY OF COMMUNITIES TO GROW THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMY. TO ACHIEVE THE MISSION, COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STAFF PROVIDE COMMUNITY LEADERS WITH TRAINING, EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND LEADERSHIP. UNHCE'S PRINCIPAL PROGRAM FOR THIS CRITICAL ISSUE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING: O TOURISM AND OUTDOOR RECREATION: THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LEADERS; COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS; LOCAL BUSINESSES; AND RECREATION AND OUTDOOR MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROGRAM SEEKS TO INCREASE TOURISM REVENUE, MINIMIZE VISITOR IMPACT, ENHANCE OUTDOOR RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES, AND INCREASE DOWNTOWN VITALITY. O MAIN STREET RESILIENCY AND REVITALIZATION: THE AUDIENCE FOR THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDES MUNICIPALITIES; LOCAL PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DE VELOPMENT COMMITTEES; VOLUNTEERS; LOCAL BUSINESSES HOUSED IN THE DOWNTOWN; AND COMMUNITY LEADERS AND VOLUNTEERS INTERESTED IN ENHANCING THEIR DOWNTOWN. RESIDENTS WILL UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS AND VISION AND PARTICIPATE IN EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE DOWNTOWN. O BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: THE AUDIENCE FOR THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDES COMMUNITIES (MUNICIPALITIES, LOCAL PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEES, AND VOLUNTEERS); BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GROUPS; ENT REPRENEUR-SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS MAKER/COWORKING SPACES, INCUBATORS, INNOVATION-FOCUSED SPACES; AND ENTREPRENEURS/BUSINESSES THAT NEED SUPPORT TO GROW/SUSTAIN. COMMUNITIES WILL UNDERSTAND THEIR EXISTING BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP ASSETS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND MOBILIZE LOCAL LEADERS AND VOLUNTEERS TO DEVELOP ACTION PLANS TO STRENGTHEN LOCAL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. O COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP AND CAPACITY: A SERIES OF TRAININGS AND WORKSHOPS ARE OFFERED TO MUNICIPAL AND CIVIC LEADERS, ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERS, AND AGENCY PARTNERS ON TOPICS LIKE MEETING MANAGEMENT, GROUP FACILITATION, COLLABORATION BUILDING, AND VIRTUAL COLLABORATION. FOR COMMUNITIES TO EFFECTIVELY ASSESS AND PRIORITIZE NEEDS AND TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES, IT IS CRITICAL THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM ALL SECTORS AND DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS MAINTAIN BASIC LEADERSHIP SKILLS THAT PROMOTE COLLABORATION, EFFECTIVE PLANNING, AND THE ABILITY TO HELP MOVE PROJECTS FROM INCEPTION TO COMPLETION.  5. EDUCATION AND 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT  NEW HAMPSHIRE YOUTH ARE IN CRITICAL NEED OF POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCES WHERE THEY FEEL A SENSE OF BELONGING AND ARE ENGAGED IN EXTENDED AND MEANINGFUL WAYS. FEEDBACK FROM RECENT FOCUS GROUPS AND KEY STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS, DATA FROM NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH, AND THE YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY, AND RESEARCH BY THE UNH INSTITUTE ON DISABILITY AND THE CARSEY INSTITUTE ALL SUGGEST THAT MULTIPLE PROBLEMS MAKE UP THIS CRITICAL ISSUES OF YOUTH TODAY INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AN INCREASED NEEDS FOR A WORKFORCE THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY AND EQUITABLY PREPARED WITH BOTH LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND STEM CONTENT KNOWLEDGE, YOUTH WHO DO NOT FEEL VALUED BY THEIR COMMUNITIES, RISING SUICIDE RATES ACROSS THE STATE, ELEVATED DRUG MISUSE AND OVERDOSES BY YOUNG ADULTS, AND INCREASED LEVELS OF MENTAL ILLNESSES IN TEENS SUCH AS ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. MAJOR PROGRAMMATIC ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: K-12 EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS: K-12 EDUCATORS (FORMAL AND NON-FORMAL) IN THE STEM AND HEALTHY LIVING DISCIPLINES ARE SUPPORTED THROUGH CAPACITY BUILDING EXPERIENCES SUCH AS ENGAGING YOUTH IN CRITICAL THINKING PRACTICES AS WELL AS INCREASING CONFIDENCE IN STEM AND HEALTH AND NUTRITION LESSON DELIVERY. THE EDUCATION PATHWAY TEAM FOCUSES EFFORTS ON KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF STEM AND HEALTHY LIVING CONTENT, EMPHASIZING REFORM-MINDED INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS INCREASED SHARING OF RESOURCES FOR YOUTH AND FAMILIES. 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: TO ADDRESS CURRENT SOCIETAL CHALLENGES AND CONTINUE TO HOLISTICALLY SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY'S YOUTH, THE NEW HAMPSHIRE 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT TEAM FOCUSES ON 3 OVERARCHING AREAS OF IMMEDIATE, AS WELL AS LONG TERM NEED: SCIENCE, HEALTHY LIVING, AND TEEN LEADERSHIP. THROUGH HANDS-ON, YOUTH-CENTERED PROGRAMMING THE 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT TEAM SEEKS TO FOSTER YOUTH'S PATH TO BECOMING ENGAGED 21ST CENTURY WORKFORCE MEMBERS AND CIVIC-MINDED CITIZENS. 4-H DELIVERY MODES SUCH AS CLUBS TO SHORT-TERM EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS (SPINS) TO SCHOOL ENRICHMENT INSTILL A SENSE OF BELONGING, DESIGNED TO BUILD RESILIENT YOU TH. THE TARGET AUDIENCE REMAINS ALL YOUTH OF NEW HAMPSHIRE WHILE THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AND SHARE RESOURCES FOR ALL COMMUNITY YOUTH AND FAMILIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "95461d50-d116-e3a5-b390-021971a75d58-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLBCXXXXG015_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735991, "Award ID": "NI23SLBCXXXXG014", "Award Amount": 4263781.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION SERVICE (OSUES) FEDERAL AWARD WILL ENCOMPASS THE FOLLOWING NEEDS-BASED PROJECTS TO BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE OF OREGON. THE FORESTS OF OREGON ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, SOCIAL WELLBEING, AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY TO ALL OREGONIANS. THESE FORESTS PROVIDE A HOST OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, A SENSE OF PLACE, AND A VALUABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE THROUGH JOBS AND WOOD PRODUCTS. OSUE WILL WORK TO ENSURE SUSTAINED BENEFITS FROM FORESTS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS BY PROMOTING FOREST STEWARDSHIP AND ENSURING SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT. THIS EFFORT AIMS TO TARGET A MULTITUDE OF AUDIENCES THAT INTERFACE WITH FORESTS. OBJECTIVES INCLUDE (1) EXPANDING THE REACH OF PEER-TO-PEER LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AMONG PRIVATE FOREST LANDOWNERS; (2) DEVELOPING AND DELIVERING CURRICULUM ON SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY TO FOREST WORKERS; AND (3) PROVIDING EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AT DEMONSTRATION FORESTS. COLLECTIVELY, THESE EFFORTS WILL INSPIRE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO THE WISE MANAGEMENT OF ALL FOREST RESOURCES TO ENSURE FOREST HEALTH AND RESILIENCE OVER THE LONG TERM. IN THE AREA OF RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS, AND INFORMED BY OUR RESEARCH FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS ON THE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF FARMS AND FARMERS, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR DISTINCT STAGES IN WHICH FARMERS SEEK AND ARE READY FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFORMATION, TRAINING, AND MENTORING. USING THIS FRAMEWORK, WE WILL: 1) DEVELOP NEW ADVANCED-LEVEL ONLINE MODULES FOR INSTRUCTIONAL LEARNING, ONLINE AND CLASSROOM, AND REFINE AN EXISTING BASIC MODULE BASED ON FARM DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES. 2) CONTINUE CURRENT AND ADD NEW ADVANCED-LEVEL EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AT OUR THREE ESTABLISHED TEACHING FARMS LOCATED IN REGIONS WITH HIGH DEMAND FOR BFR PROGRAMMING. 3) CONTINUE SUCCESSFUL FACILITATION OF FARMER NETWORKS ORGANIZED BY GENDER, GEOGRAPHY AND CROPPING SYSTEM. 4) SUPPORT AND ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE STATEWIDE BEGINNING FARMER AND RANCHER WORKING GROUP OF THE OREGON COMMUNITY FOOD SYSTEMS NETWORK. THE HEALTH AND VITALITY OF OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IS INEXTRICABLE TIED TO THE WELLBEING OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. THE WARM SPRINGS RESERVATION HAS BEEN PLAGUED FOR YEARS WITH CHRONIC UNEMPLOYMENT, HEALTH ISSUES DUE TO POOR NUTRITION, LOW HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES AND A STRUGGLING LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION INDUSTRY. USDA CLASSIFIES WARM SPRINGS AS A \"FOOD DESERT\" AND 95% OF CHILDREN ATTENDING THE WARM SPRINGS K-8 SCHOOL QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED SCHOOL LUNCHES. THEREFORE, IT MAKES SENSE TO PURSUE AN EXTENSION \"FOOD FOCUS\" PROGRAM TO INCREASE FOOD PRODUCTION ON THE RESERVATION AND HELP ALLEVIATE POVERTY. WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH WARM SPRINGS, OSU EXTENSION CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THE TRIBES' GOALS OF REDUCING OBESITY, INCREASING EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCING THEIR OWN LOCALLY GROWN FOOD. TEACHING CLASSES IN FOOD PRODUCTION, HOSTING EDUCATIONAL LIVESTOCK CLINICS, BUILDING COMMUNITY/YOUTH GARDENS THAT BECOME A SOURCE OF COMMUNITY PRIDE, ARE EXCELLENT WAYSOF ALLEVIATING POVERTY AND POTENTIALLY SPARKING INTEREST IN DEVELOPING AG BUSINESSES. IN THESE EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS, SURVEYS WILL BE ADMINISTERED TO GATHER DATA THAT CAN HELP DETERMINE WHETHER OSU IS MEETING THESE TRIBAL GOALS. BY INCREASING TRIBAL MEMBERS' KNOWLEDGE IN GARDENING, ENCOURAGING NEW TRIBAL BUSINESSES IN AGRICULTURE AND PROVIDING THE TOOLS TO BUILD FARMS AND GARDENS THAT GROW HEALTHY FOOD, THE SOCIETAL BENEFITS OF DECREASING UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCREASING THE HEALTH OF TRIBAL MEMBERS CAN BE OBTAINED. THROUGH FEDERAL FUNDING, THESE EFFORTS WILL HELP IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF OREGON AND BEYOND.

THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY INTERDISCIPLINARY, APPLYING THE BIOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, AND SOCIAL SCIENCES TO CHALLENGES IN AGRICULTURAL, FOOD, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS. OUR WORK ENCOMPASSES FARMS AND FORESTS, FOOD AND FIBER, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND ENVIRONMENT HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION AS THE HOME OF THE KENTUCKY AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION AND THE KENTUCKY COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE. THE TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS ARE PART OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM THAT MAINTAINS A STATEWIDE PRESENCE AND LINKS LOCAL, STATE, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ISSUES. KENTUCKY STATE UNIVERSITY LAND GRANT PROGRAM AND COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE, COMMUNITIES, AND THE ENVIRONMENT (ACE) FOCUSES ON TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND EXTENSION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE SMALL SCALE AND LIMITED RESOURCE FARMERS; MINORITY AND UNDERSERVED/DISPARITY COMMUNITIES, AS WELL AS DIVERSE AND AT RISK YOUTHS. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY NEW AND NICHE PRODUCTS AND MARKETS FOR SMALL SCALE, LIMITED RESOURCE, AND MINORITY FARMERS, TO ENHANCE AVAILABILITY AND SAFETY OF LOCALLY PRODUCED, NUTRITIOUS FOODS, AND REDUCE FERTILIZER AND PESTICIDE RUNOFF TO IMPROVE SOIL AND WATER QUALITY WHILE REDUCING FARMER AND FORESTER EXPENSES. OUR VISION IS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR EXCELLENCE IN FOSTERING LEARNING THAT CHANGES LIVES, DISCOVERIES THAT CHANGE THE WORLD AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT SHAPE THE FUTURE. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION, AS FULL PARTNERS WITH EXPANDING LINKAGES THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY AND KENTUCKY STATE UNIVERSITY AND WITH SUPPORT FROM EVERY KENTUCKY COUNTY, SEEK TO 1) FACILITATE LIFELONG LEARNING INFORMED BY SCHOLARSHIP AND RESEARCH,2) EXPAND KNOWLEDGE THROUGH CREATIVE RESEARCH AND DISCOVERY, AND 3) SERVE KENTUCKIANS BY SHARING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION SEEK TO SUSTAIN THE LAND GRANT HERITAGE OF ACHIEVEMENT IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES, BUT THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE UNIVERSITIES ARE UNDERGOING MANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. AS KENTUCKY CONTINUES TO MOVE FROM A TOBACCO BASED AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY AND EXPLORES NEW OPTIONS AND COMMODITIES, LAND GRANT PROGRAMS FACE INCREASED DEMANDS AND EXPECTATIONS. TECHNOLOGY IS REDEFINING THE WAY PEOPLE ACQUIRE AND DISTRIBUTE INFORMATION AND HOW THEY SOLVE PROBLEMS. WHILE URBANIZATION IS CLAIMING FARMLAND, IT IS ALSO CREATING NEW MARKETS FOR TRADITIONAL AND NON TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. CHANGING LIFESTYLES AND DEMOGRAPHICS ARE CHALLENGING US WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER INVOLVEMENT IN YOUTH, FAMILY, AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. WITH NEARLY 80,000 FARMS IN THE STATE AND AN AVERAGE 171 ACRES PER OPERATION, KENTUCKY IS DOMINATED BY SMALL FAMILY FARMS. HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE FARMS ARE MAJOR PRODUCERS OF TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES, SUCH AS LIVESTOCK, TOBACCO, AND GRAIN. SOME SEEK NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN SPECIALTY CROPS AND INDUSTRIAL HEMP. OTHERS ARE OPERATED ON A PARTTIME BASIS OR INVOLVE LIMITED RESOURCES. THE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AT BOTH LAND GRANT INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE THE BREADTH NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE STATES DIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AND AGROECOSYSTEMS. MORE THAN HALF OF THE STATES CASH RECEIPTS FROM FARM MARKETS RESULT FROM ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS. SIGNATURE INDUSTRIES INCLUDE BEEF AND EQUINE, WHICH RELY ON CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH TO MITIGATE FESCUE TOXICOSIS, CONTROL INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMPROVE REPRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCIES. NEARLY ALL ANIMAL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING POULTRY, SWINE, SMALL RUMINANTS, AND AQUACULTURE, ARE FACED WITH INCREASING PUBLIC PRESSURE TO ENSURE HIGH LEVELS OF ANIMAL WELFARE AND OPERATE IN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE WAYS. THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST AMONG PRODUCERS FOR PRECISION ANIMAL MANAGEMENT TOOLS THAT CAN HELP INCREASE MARGINS AND A CONTINUED NEED FOR ASSISTANCE DEVELOPING AND MARKETING VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE STATES DECLINING DAIRY INDUSTRY AND FOR SMALL AND LIMITED RESOURCE FARMERS. SOYBEANS AND GRAIN CROPS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO KENTUCKY AS THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO DECLINE. PRODUCERS RELY ON THE LAND GRANTS FOR RESEARCH BASED GUIDANCE ON MANAGING INTENSIVE PRODUCTION WITH MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS ADDRESS MANAGEMENT OF NUTRIENTS, PESTS AND DISEASES, VARIETY SELECTION IN A CHANGING CLIMATE AND WATER MANAGEMENT. THEY HELP PRODUCERS EFFECTIVELY USE PROVEN PRECISION FARMING AND LAND MANAGEMENT TOOLS. ADDITIONALLY, FORAGE SYSTEMS UNDERPIN THE STATES SIGNATURE EQUINE AND BEEF INDUSTRIES; THEIR MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BE A FOCUS FOR RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. HISTORICALLY, MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD MAJOR DEPENDENCE ON FARM INCOMES FOR THEIR ECONOMIC VIABILI COMMITMENTS TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF AN \"AGRITECH\" ECOSYSTEM, AS WELL AS VALUE?ADDED INNOVATIONS THAT UTILIZE LOCAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF LIVESTOCK, HORTICULTURE, SECONDARY WOOD PRODUCTS, AND AGRITOURISM. THE CURRENT PUBLIC INTEREST IN COMMUNITY? AND REGION?BASED LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS PROVIDES KENTUCKY'S RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO SHOWCASE RELEVANCE TO ALL CITIZENS ACROSS THE STATE AND ADDRESS ISSUES OF FOOD SECURITY, NUTRITION, PROSPERITY, AND SUSTAINABILITY IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. THE MISSION OF AN EFFECTIVE FOOD SAFETY SYSTEM IS TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH BY ENSURING THAT FOODS MEET SCIENCE?BASED SAFETY STANDARDS. OVER 50% OF ALL FOOD?BORNE ILLNESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO MISTAKES MADE IN FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS AND RESTAURANTS, WHILE 20% ARE TRACEABLE TO CONSUMERS IN THEIR HOMES. CHANGES IN THE RISK OF FOOD?BORNE DISEASE ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO CHANGES IN DIET, INCREASED USE OF COMMERCIAL FOOD SERVICE AND FOOD PREPARED AND EATEN AWAY FROM HOME, NEW METHODS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING FOOD, AND THE GROWING NUMBER OF AT?RISK INDIVIDUALS, SUCH AS THE ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH ELEVATED RISKS TO THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE ALSO NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE GROWING USE OF DIETARY AND HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT HAVE NO REQUIRED SAFETY STANDARDS, NEW FOOD COMPONENTS THAT MIMIC TRADITIONAL FOOD COMPONENTS, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW FOOD TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESSES. EDUCATIONAL TRAINING ON THE SAFE PRODUCTION, PREPARATION, HANDLING, AND STORAGE OF FOOD FOR PRODUCERS, PROCESSORS, CONSUMERS, AND AT?RISK GROUPS IS THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO DECREASE THE RISKS OF FOOD?BORNE ILLNESS. ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED ON RESEARCH, DISCOVERY, AND EDUCATION IN THE AREAS OF PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING PRACTICES. THESE PROGRAMS WILL FOCUS ON ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES AS WELL AS THE GROWING HOME AND MICRO PROCESSING FOOD INDUSTRY. THREE LEADING CAUSES OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN KENTUCKY ARECARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, CANCER, AND DIABETES. THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THEIR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF THESE CHRONIC DISEASES INCLUDE STRONG NUTRITIONAL AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COMPONENTS. OBESITY IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE DISEASES. IN KENTUCKY, THE PREVALENCE OF OVERWEIGHT ADULTS HAS ESCALATED OVER THE LAST DECADES. EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER, DIABETES, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE AND LONGEVITY. PREVENTION, DETECTION, AND TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE IN KENTUCKY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN TODAY'S CHANGING HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT. PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISEASES REQUIRE SKILLS FOR SELF?CARE. WITHOUT SUCH SKILLS, PEOPLE WITH DIABETES OR HEART DISEASE OFTEN REQUIRE COSTLY ACUTE CARE. THE PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES THROUGH BETTER SELF?CARE ALSO REQUIRES SKILLS. DIET, NUTRITION, AND EXERCISE ARE SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR SELF?CARE AND PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES. DIETS RICH IN FAT AND LOW IN FIBER CONTRIBUTE TO OBESITY, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND CANCER. NUTRITION PROGRAMS LIKE THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE'S 5?A DAY AND USDA'S MYPLATE CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON KENTUCKY CITIZENS AND COMM UNITIES. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE KENTUCKY ADULTS EATS AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. IN RURAL AREAS OF KENTUCKY, INCLUDING APPALACHIAN AND WESTERN REGIONS AS WELL AS IN URBAN AREAS, CONSUMERS MAY NOT HAVE READY ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT REASONABLE PRICES. YOUNGER GENERATIONS ARE LESS FAMILIAR WITH MANAGING AND PREPARING FOOD AT HOME. OVER 50% OF KENTUCKIANS WITH INCOMES JUST BELOW POVERTY LEVEL ARE OVERWEIGHT, AND CHILDREN AND YOUTH ARE ESPECIALLY AT RISK. THE NEED TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CITIZENS OF THE COMMONWEALTH IS EVIDENT. LIKE MOST STATES ACROSS THE NATION, KENTUCKY IS ALSO BATTLING ADDICTION, PRIMARILY THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. THIS IS NOT ONLY AFFECTING THE HEALTH AND WELL?BEING OF RESIDENTS, BUT IT IS ALSO CAUSING MAJOR ECONOMIC EFFECTS. WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS, THEY ARE UNABLE TO FIND MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. IN TURN, THIS COULD CAUSE BUSINESSES TO RECONSIDER LOCATING OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY COMMUNITIES DUE TO THE LACK OF A QUALIFIED AND SOBER WORKFORCE. KENTUCKY COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SYSTEM IS WORKING TO COMBAT THESE ISSUES THROUGH UNIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. KENTUCKY'S NATURAL BIOLOGICAL WEALTH AND BEAUTY HAS DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF PEOPLE FOR CENT URIES. THE AGRICULTURAL, FOREST, AND COAL INDUSTRIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ECONOMIC BASE FOR KENTUCKY'S ECONOMY, BUT KENTUCKY'S BIOLOGICAL WEALTH IS THREATENED. PROTECTING SOIL, AIR AND WATER RESOURCES THROUGH BETTER LAND MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES IS A PRIME GOAL OF PROGRAMS THAT SERVE THE SPECTRUM OF KENTUCKY'S AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISES, RURAL LANDSCAPES, AND COMMUNITIES. OUR PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NO?TILL PRODUCTION AND THAT LEGACY WILL CONTINUE THROUGH NEW INNOVATIONS IN SOIL AND WATER MANAGEMENT. CONCERN OVER ECOSYSTEM ISSUES BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS WELL AS NATIONAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT HAS GENERATED RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. KENTUCKY'S BIOLOGICAL WEALTH MAY CONTINUE TO BE THREATENED UNLESS COMPREHENSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES ARE RESEARCHED AND UTILIZED FOR ENJOYING, STUDYING, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, HARVESTING THE FRUITS OF THE LAND THROUGH LOGGING, MINING, AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. ECOSYSTEM SERVICES MUST BE PRESERVED, ANTI?MICROBIAL RESISTANCE MUST BE MITIGATED, AND POLLINATOR POPULATIONS MUST BE PROTECTED. APPROACHES MUST ALSO CONSIDER HOW THESE SYSTEMS ADAPT TO AND MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. PROGRAMS MUST STRIVE TO ELUCIDATE HOW CLIMATE CHANGE WILL IMPACT AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE SYSTEMS WHILE DEVELOPING PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL HELP FARMERS, FORESTERS, AND OTHERS ADAPT. THE LAND GRANT SYSTEM'S MISSION OF ENHANCINGECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR AMERICANS GOES WELL BEYOND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. IT INCLUDES THE EMPOWERMENT OF PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES THROUGH RESEARCH?BASED INFORMATION AND EDUCATION TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES FA CING OUR YOUTH, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ARE: FAMILIES FACE INCREASING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. MANY KENTUCKY FAMILIES ARE IN DEBT AND ARE NOT SAVING ENOUGH TO SECURE THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURE; MANY ARE ON THE EDGE OF FINANCIAL DISASTER. FAMILIES NEED ASSISTANCE IN LEARNING TO LIVE WITHIN THEIR INCOME AND EARNING CAPACITY AND IN PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE. BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE CONTINUE TO BE PLAGUED BY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT. NEARLY 30% OF KENTUCKY'S YOUTH FAIL TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. WITH MANY INDUSTRIES RELOCATING TO OTHER COUNTRIES, JOB CLOSINGS HAVE AFFECTED MANY AREAS OF THE STATE. MANY KENTUCKIANS LACK THE EDUCATIONAL PREPARATION AND SKILLS NEEDED TO SECURE AND MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT OR QUALIFY FOR NEW?ERA JOBS. THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES, BOTH YOUTH AND ADULT KENTUCKIANS NEED TO DEVELOP SKILLS ESSENTIAL TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND WORKFORCE. BEING A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY AS AN ADULT REQUIRES YOUNG PEOPLE TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AS ACTIVE CITIZENS AT AN EARLY AGE. 4?H COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES PROVIDE LEARNING EXPERIENCES THAT HELP YOUTH DEVELOP LIFE SKILLS NEEDED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN VARIOUS ADULT ROLES IN SOCIETY. OUR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE CAPACITY OF COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES, AND OTHERS THAT AFFECT THE LIVES OF CITIZENS. WE CAN BEST DO THIS BY FOSTERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONAL AND INTERPERSONAL SKILLS, STIMULATING VOLUNTEER LEADERSHIP, AND PROMOTING ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY PROBLEM?SOLVING. WITHOUT THE ACQUISITION OF LIFE SKILLS NEEDED BY YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS, IT IS DOUBTFUL THE CITIZENS OF KENTUCKY WILL REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AS BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND AS MEMBERS OF FAMILIES. WE APPROACH KENTUCKY'S CHALLENGES THROUGH AN INTEGRATED MODEL THAT INCLUDES A NEEDS ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL THROUGH THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE, ADVISORY GROUPS, COUNCILS, AND COMMITTEES. ONCE IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITIES, SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND NEEDS ARE ADDRESSED BY OUR RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION SPECIALISTS. THE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENTS, FINDINGS, AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE TRANSFERRED THROUGH TRADITIONAL AND INNOVATIVE MECHANISMS, INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING PROGRAMS, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, RESEARCH REPORTS, AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES, AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WHETHER IT IS PRESERVING OUR RICH AGRICULTURAL TRADITION BY HELPING FARMERS, FOOD PROCESSORS, AND AGRIBUSINESS COPE WITH TECHNICAL ISSUES, REACHING GOALS, OR ENHANCING THE LIFE SKILLS OF FAMILIES, OUR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS ARE HELPING SHAPE THE FUTURE OF KENTUCKY'S AGRICULTURE, FOOD SYSTEMS, AND COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF ITS CITIZENS.ENS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "87653fcf-f47e-7d0c-d45f-ba5925ed7f78-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLBCXXXXG012_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735951, "Award ID": "NI23SLBCXXXXG011", "Award Amount": 2056756.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND LIFE SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED, DYNAMIC COMMUNITY OF ACCOMPLISHED SCIENTISTS AND INTELLECTUALLY DRIVEN SCHOLARS.

IN PAST YEARS THESE TWO INSTITUTIONS SUBMITTED A COMBINED PLAN OF WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR 1890 LAND GRANT PARTNER WEST VIRGINIA STATE UNIVERSITY (INCLUDING BOTH THEIR EXPERIMENT STATION AND EXTENSION). WE HAVE WORKED TO DEVELOP SIX STATEWIDE CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS IN A SPAN OF FIVE YEARS (2020-2024). RECENT STAKEHOLDER INPUTS ALIGNED WITH OUR EXISTING CRITICAL ISSUES. THEREFORE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE SIX CRITICAL ISSUES AS A GUIDE FOR ALL PROGRAM/PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. OUR SIX CRITICAL ISSUES ARE: FOOD ACCESS, SECURITY AND SAFETY/SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, HEALTH DISPARITIES, COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION, STRENGTHENING YOUTH AND FAMILIES, AND NUTRITION AND OBESITY PREVENTION. THE WVAFES SUPPORTS APPROXIMATELY 46 FTE RESEARCH FACULTY POSITIONS DISTRIBUTED ACR OSS THE 110 INDIVIDUAL SCIENTIST POSITIONS. THE STATION ALSO SUPPORTS APPROXIMATELY 20 CLERICAL AND FARM/FOREST WORKER POSITIONS AND 81 PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT POSITIONS (MOSTLY GRADUATE STUDENTS). THE EXPERIMENT STATION OPERATES SEVEN FARMS AND TWO FORESTS WHICH SUPPORT FACULTY RESEARCH. FOUR OF THE FARMS (STEWARTSTOWN ROAD FARM, HORTICULTURE/ORGANIC FARM, AGRONOMY FARM IN MORGANTOWN AND JW RUBY FARM IN REEDSVILLE) AND THE UNIVERSITY FOREST ARE SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS TO BE USED EXTENSIVELY TO SUPPORT ACADEMIC PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO RESEARCH. OUTLYING FARMS INCLUDE THE REYMANN MEMORIAL FARM (BEEF, SHEEP, AGRONOMIC CROPS, AND BULL TESTING STATION) AND KEARNEYSVILLE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH FARM (PRIMARILY APPLES AND PEACHES) IN NORTHEASTERN WEST VIRGINIA; THE WILLOW BEND FARM IN THE SOUTHEAST (PASTURE RAISED AND FINISHED BEEF); AND THE TYGART VALLEY FOREST (MOSTLY OAK REGENERATION AND DISEASE CONTROL RESEARCH). THREE CENTERS AND ONE ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT EXIST ALL OR IN PART WITHIN THE COLLEGE TO HELP FOCUS AND DIRECT OUR EFFORTS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE HATCH AND MCINTIRE-STENNIS CAPACITY FUNDING BY ATTRACTING EXTERNAL COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND OTHER EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDING. THE THREE CENTERS ARE THE NATURAL RESOURCE ANALYSIS CENTER (NRAC), THE APPALACHIAN HARDWOODS CENTER (AHC) AND THE INSTITUTE FOR WATER SECURITY AND SCIENCE (IWSS). ALL WVUES SPECIALISTS AND COUNTY AGENTS ARE APPOINTED AS FACULTY AT WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY. AS SUCH THEY UNDERGO THE SAME FACULTY REVIEWS AS OTHER UNIVERSITY FACULTY AND ARE RECOGNIZED, REWARDED, AND PROMOTED UNDER THE SAME PROTOCOL. EACH YEAR, EVERY EXTENSION FACULTY MEMBER SUBMITS AN INDIVIDUAL POW TO PROGRAM UNIT DIRECTORS FOR APPROVAL. THE PLANS ARE THEN EVALUATED BASED ON HOW THEY ADDRESS WVU EXTENSION CRITICAL ISSUES, MEET THE NEEDS OF WEST VIRGINIA CITIZENS AND PRODUCE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES. IN DECEMBER OF EACH YEAR, EVERY EXTENSION FACULTY MEMBER SUBMITS A FACULTY FILE WHICH CONTAINS PRODUCTIVITY CHARTS, ACCOMPLISHMENT NARRATIVES, AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND SERVICE. DEPENDING ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND WHETHER THE FACULTY MEMBER IS APPLYING FOR PROMOTION, THE FILES ARE EVALUATED BY PROGRAM UNIT PEERS, PROGRAM UNIT DIRECTOR, AN EXTENSION-WIDE COMMITTEE, EXTENSION DEAN AND DIRECTOR, AND THE WVU PROVOST (FOR DECISION YEARS ONLY). THE SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PROCESS AT WVUES INCLUDES BLIND, EXTERNAL REVIEWS OF NEW EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS SUCH AS CURRICULA, WHITE PAPERS, FACT SHEETS AND BULLETINS. THE PROCESS BEGINS WHEN AN EXTENSION FACULTY MEMBER CREATES A NEW EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENT THAT IS INTENDED TO BE USED ACROSS THE STATE. THE FACULTY MEMBER SUBMITS THE DOCUMENT TO THE PROGRAM UNIT DIRECTOR OR DESIGNEE WHO RECRUITS EXTERNAL REVIEWERS WITH SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERTISE WHO ARE WILLING TO REVIEW THE DOCUMENT(S) AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK. THE FEEDBACK GOES TO PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND THE FACULTY MEMBER. TOGETHER THEY DECIDE WHAT AND IF ANY REVISIONS ARE NECESSARY BEFORE THE DOCUMENT IS DISSEMINATED. WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THIS PROCESS FOR THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS PLAN OF WORK. JOURNAL ARTICLES AND GRANT APPLICATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE REVIEWED USING METHODS ESTABLISHED BY THE PUBLISHER OR THE GRANTING AGENCY. THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS FOR THE WVAFES INCLUDES REVIEW OF STATION HATCH PROJECTS BY AT LEAST THREE FACULTY WITH KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD, REVIEW BY THE UNIT DIRECTOR AND REVIEW BY THE EXPERIMENT STATION DIRECTOR, PRIOR TO SUBMISSION TO NIFA. MULTI-STATE HATCH PROJECTS ARE REVIEWED BY THE RELEVANT REGIONAL ASSOCIATION WITH INPUT FROM AT LEAST THREE EXTERNAL REVIEWERS, A REVIEW BY THE MULTI-STATE ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE AND ULTIMATELY BY THE FULL BOARD OF THE RELEVANT REGIONAL ASSOCIATION. STAKEHOLDER INPUT IS VALUED BY WVUES AND WVAFES; EACH ORGANIZATION INCLUDES COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSIONALS THAT COORDINATE A VARIETY OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES AND SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS TO INCREASE NON-TRADITIONAL STAKEHOLDER AWARENESS AND MAKE UNIVERSITY RESOURCES MORE  AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. THESE ACTIVITIES WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE 2020-2024 PLAN OF WORK. PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE WVU DAY AT THE LEGISLATURE, ACTIVITIES AND THE WVU BUILDING AT THE STATE FAIR OF WEST VIRGINIA, AND KIDDIE DAYS AT THE FARM. ADMINISTRATORS, PROGRAM DIRECTORS, AND DIVISION DIRECTORS WILL CONTINUE TO MEET WITH TRADITIONAL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS SUCH AS FARM BUREAU, 4-H VOLUNTEERS, 4-H TEEN COUNCIL, MASTER GARDENERS, COMMUNITY EDUCATION OUTREACH SERVICE (CEOS) MEMBERS, THE WEST VIRGINIA AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY HALL OF FAME, AND OTHER STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS TO LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS AND THEIR INPUT INTO PRIORITY PROGRAMMING. WVU EXTENSION AND WVU AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY EXPERIMENT STATION WILL CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH THE PURPOSIVE SAMPLING OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN OUR PROGRAMS, THOSE WHO HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN OUR PROGRAMS, COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, KEY DECISION MAKERS, EXTENSION VOLUNTEERS, SERVICE COMMITTEES, AND EXTENSION EMPLOYEES. THIS METHOD OF IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS, AND ORGANIZATIONS IS REPLICATED IN EACH WV COUNTY TO ENSURE WE HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF STATEWIDE STAKEHOLDERS' INPUT. COUNTY AND STATE FACULTY WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THEIR ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES BY BECOMING ACTIVE MEMBERS IN INDUSTRY AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AS WELL AS SERVING ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACTION TEAMS. WE BELIEVE THAT ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY BASED ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES HELPS US TO STRENGTHEN OUR CONNECTIONS TO STAKEHOLDERS AND THROUGH THIS, WE BECOME AWARE OF LOCAL AND STATEWIDE ISSUES THAT COULD INFORM OUR PROGRAMMING. WVU EXTENSION AND WVU AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY EXPERIMENT STATION WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE NEEDS OF WEST VIRGINIANS BY PARTNERING WITH STATE AGENCIES, LOCAL AGENCIES, AND OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS INTHE STATE, AND NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN WV GRASSROOTS. FACULTY WILL CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE ACROSS DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES TO DESIGN PROGRAMS/PROJECTS THAT WILL TAKE AN HOLISTIC APPROACH TOWARDS IMPROVING THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF WEST VIRGINIANS. METHOD FOR COLLECTING STAKEHOLDER INPUTS WILL CONTINUE TO INCLUDE COUNTY-SPECIFIC FOCUS GROUP SESSIONS, STATEWIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENT SURVEY, AND ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS/CONSULTATIONS WITH PAST PROGRAM/PROJECT BENEFICIARIES. THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT WVUE AND WVUAFES CONTINUE TO EMPLOY A STAKEHOLDER-CENTERED PROGRAM/PROJECT DESIGN. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO DRAW ON SECONDARY STAKEHOLDER INPUTS BY MONITORING DATA TRENDS PUBLISHED BY AGENCIES SUCH AS THE WV DEPARTMENT OF AGRIC ULTURE, WV DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, CENTER FOR DISEASE AND PREVENTION CONTROL, WV DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN RESOURCES AMONG OTHERS. IN MARCH 2022, WE COMPLETED A NEEDS ASSESSMENT SURVEY OF KEY DECISIONMAKERS (SENATORS, DELEGATES, COUNTY OFFICIALS, ETC) ACROSS THE STATE ANDTHE RESULTS REAFFIRMED OUR CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES. STAKEHOLDER CENTERED APPROACH TO PROGRAM AND PROJECT DESIGN IS AT THE CORE OF WVU EXTENSION AND WVUAFES CORE OPERATIONS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE STAKEHOLDER INPUT DATA TO TEASE OUT PROGRAM/PROJECT GAPS AND IMPROVEMENTS. INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM STAKEHOLDERS WILL ALSO BE USED TO EVALUATE WHERE WE ARE IN ADDRESSING OUR CRITICAL ISSUES AND WHERE WE WANT TO BE BY THE END OF THIS CURRENT POW IMPLEMENTATION. WE WILL REMAIN FLEXIBLE BECAUSE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EMERGING ISSUES IN A SPECIFIC ISSUE AREA MAY LEAD TO REDIRECTION OF PROGRAM RESOURCES OR ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR A SPECIFIC PROJECT WITHIN THE PROGRAM. INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND DATA TRENDS ON HEALTH AND WELL BEING, EDUCATION, AND PROSPERITY, AS THEY AFFECT WEST VIRGINIANS, WILL BE USED TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO AREAS OF GREATEST NEED AND IMPACT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WV", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "00b062d0-a179-1efa-2618-43bea86b43fd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLBCXXXXG010_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736079, "Award ID": "NI23SLBCXXXXG009", "Award Amount": 2104386.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "PROJECT ABSTRACT THE UNIVERSITY OF GUAM (UOG) IS THE ONLY 4-YEAR PUBLIC INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN GUAM.

COMMUNITY, ECONOMY, AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; 5. FAMILY AND WELL -BEING AND 6. POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. CRITICAL ISSUE # 1 WILL DIRECT EFFORTS TOWARDS FOOD SECURITY INCLUDE THE USE OF HIGH TUNNELS TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE LOCAL FOOD PRODUCTION BY FARMERS AND URBAN AREAS. INTEGRATED EFFORTS AMONG EXTENSION AGENTS AND FAMILY EDUCATORS TO IMPROVE AGRI-BUSINESS ECONOMIC AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO INCREASE FOOD SECURITY IN FARMS, HOMES, SCHOOLS, AND COMMUNITIES WILL CONTINUE. EFFORTS IN ANIMAL PRODUCTION FOCUS ON ANIMAL WELLBEING, ESTABLISHMENT OF IMPROVED FORAGES, PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE EXTREME WEATHER RESILIENCE AND TO INCREASE TO INCREASE ADDED VALUE OF SMALL RUMINANTS. THE USE OF DRONES FOR ESTIMATION OF VEGETATION BIOMASS AND DEVELOPMENT OF WASTE MANAGEMENT PLANS ARE RECENT ADAPTED TOOLS BEING USE TO HELP FARMERS. TROUGH THE PLANT DISEASE CLINIC, EARLY DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF PESTS AND DISEASES CONTINUES TO BE CRITICAL FOR PLANT SYSTEMS. NEW DISEASES AND PESTS ARE MAINLY DISSEMINATED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND PRAES ONLINE WEB PAGES. CRITICAL ISSUE # 2 WILL BE ADDRESSED BY ENCOURAGING FARMERS TO INCREASE THE USE OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE PRACTICES THAT HELP IN PROTECTING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES SUCH AS COVER CROPS, NO-TILL AND ROTATIONAL GRAZING AND AID FARMERS, FAMILIES AND 4H MEMBERS TO PROMOTE THE USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. ADDITIONAL EFFORTS WILL IDENTIFY SUCCESSFUL ADAPTATIONS TO EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS BASED ON RISK EXPOSURE ASSESSMENTS, AGRICULTURAL BIODIVERSITY PRACTICES, BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES RELATED TO SOIL QUALITY AND, MITIGATION OF THREATS TO WATER QUALITY.

CODY STONE. DR.STONE REPORTS DIRECTLY TO PRESIDENT WADED CRUZADO AND BOTH HE AND DR. BAJWA ARE PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE COUNCIL. EXTENSION HAS ALWAYS HAD A GRASSROOTS STRUCTURE, WITH AGENTS LIVING AND WORKING ACROSS THE STATE TO ENSURE DEEP ENGAGEMENT WITH PRODUCERS, FAMILIES, BUSINESSES, AND COMMUNITIES. EXTENSION ALSO INCLUDES CAMPUS-BASED SPECIALISTS AND ASSOCIATE SPECIALISTS WHO BRIDGE INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, AND STATE EXPERTISE TO COMMUNITIES, STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. MOST PROJECTS ARE BORN DIRECTLY FROM THE CHALLENGES AND DESIRES OF THE STATE'S PEOPLE. OFTEN, PROJECTS HAVE TREMENDOUS LOCAL IMPACT. MANY ARE TIGHTLY LINKED WITH LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL PRIORITIES FROM A DIVERSITY OF SUPPORTING AGENCIES. FOR MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP PURPOSES, THE STATE IS DIVIDED INTO THREE REGIONS-EAST, CENTRAL AND WEST-WITH EXTENSION DEPARTMENT HEADS LEADING EACH REGION. EXTENSION LEVERAGES SMITH LEVER DOLLARS WITH COUNTY CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUPPORT SALARIES AND OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR MONTANA'S 94 COUNTY AND RESERVATION EXTENSION AGENTS. EXTENSION'S MAIN PROGRAM AREAS ARE AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES, 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. MANY MSU FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE APPOINTMENTS THAT SPAN TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND OUTREACH, WITH THEIR FTE SPLIT BETWEEN COA, MAES, AND EXTENSION. EXTENSION ALSO HAS FACULTY IN THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND THE COLLEGE OF LETTERS AND SCIENCE. COLLECTIVELY, HATCH, SMITH-LEVER, STATE OF MONTANA, AND COUNTY AND LOCAL FUNDING CONTINUE TO ALLOW MSU'S FACULTY TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF MONTANA, EXPLORE UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO PRESSING QUESTIONS, AND SOLVE GLOBAL PROBLEMS. THESE FUNDS PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR COA/MAES AND EXTENSION TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE FOR COMPLEMENTARY GRANT FUNDING. MSU CONTINUES ITS ROLE AS THE HOSTING INSTITUTION FOR THE WESTERN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION (SARE) PROGRAM. SARE IS A USDA PROGRAM THAT OPERATESWITH COMPETITIVE GRANTS CONDUCTED COOPERATIVELY BY FARMERS, RANCHERS, RESEARCHERS, AND AG PROFESSIONALS TO ADVANCE FARM AND RANCH SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROFITABLE, ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND, AND GOOD FOR COMMUNITIES. ALL SARE-FUNDED PROJECTS ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH COMPONENTS IN THEIR DESIGN. MONTANA IS HOME TO THE MOST LAND-GRANT INSTITUTIONS OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION. IN ADDITION TO MSU, WHICH IS PART OF THE ORIGINAL MORRILL ACT OF 1862, THERE ARE SEVEN TRIBAL COLLEGES THAT RECEIVED THE DESIGNATION THROUGH THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1994. THESE INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR TRIBAL AFFILIATIONS ARE: AANIJIH NAKODA COLLEGE (GROS VENTRE AND ASSINIBOINE), BLACKFEET COMMUNITY COLLEGE (BLACKFEET), CHIEF DULL KNIFE COLLEGE (NORTHERN CHEYENNE), FORT PECK COMMUNITY COLLEGE (SIOUX AND ASSINIBOINE), LITTLE BIG HORN COLLEGE (CROW), SALISH KOOTENAI COLLEGE (BITTERROOT SALISH, KOOTENAI, AND PEND D'OREILLE KOOTENAI OF THE FLATHEAD NATION) AND STONE CHILD COLLEGE (CHIPPEWA-CREE). IN ADDITION, FOUR OF THE RESERVATIONS PARTNER WITH MSU EXTENSION THROUGH THE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBAL EXTENSION PROGRAM (FRTEP). THE BLACKFEET, FLATHEAD, FORT BELKNAP, AND FORT PECK RESERVATIONS ALL HAVE EXTENSION AGENTS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AND PERFORM DUTIES MUCH LIKE COUNTY AGENTS. MSU RECENTLY ADOPTED A NEW 2019-2024 STRATEGIC PLAN: CHOOSING PROMISE HTTP://WWW.MONTANA.EDU/STRATEGICPLAN/INDEX.HTML. THE PLAN INCLUDES THREE CENTRAL PRIORITIES: TRANSFORMATIONAL LEARNING, SCHOLARSHIP THAT IMPROVES LIVES, AND EXPANDING ENGAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN IDENTIFIES FOUR GRAND CHALLENGES OF PARTICULAR FOCUS FOR MSU. THESE ARE: CARING FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE, DESIGN, ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE; PROMOTING WELLNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES: ACCESS AND EQUALITY IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH OUTCOMES, COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH, BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP; FOOD AND FUEL SECURITY: SUSTAINED FOODSYSTEMS, PRECISION AGRICULTURE, ENERGY PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE; AND SECURING THE FUTURE OF MONTANA: CYBERSECURITY, PHOTONICS AND OPTICS, DEFENSE, GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC POLICY. IN FEBRUARY 2020, THE COA/MAES ADOPTED ITS COLLEGE AND EXPERIMENT STATION-SPECIFIC STRATEGIC PLAN, HTTP://AG.MONTANA.EDU/STRATEGICPL AN.HTML. THE FIVE-YEAR PLAN WAS DEVELOPED OVER A 9-MONTH PERIOD WITH INPUT FROM FACULTY, STAFF, STUDENTS, ALUMNI, AND MONTANA COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO LOOK TO COA/MAES TO PROVIDE IMPACTFUL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. THE PLAN IS INTENDED TO GUIDE THE COLLEGE AND EXPERIMENT STATION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND SETS OUT GOALS THAT WILL ENSURE THE GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION, TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH, AND ENGAGING OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT MONTANA AND BEYOND. THE PLAN HAS SEVEN FOCUS AREAS, WITH 2-3 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES FOR EACH FOCUS AREA. THE FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE: A PEOPLE-DRIVEN ENVIRONMENT; IMPACTFUL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; TRANSFORMATIONAL TEACHING ANDLEARNING; EFFECTIVE AND INCLUSIVE ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH; STRENGTHENING AND GROWING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS; STRATEGIC STEWARDSHIP OF RESOURCES; AND TRANSPARENT AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION. THE COA/MAES STRATEGIC PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE DIRECTION FOR THE COLLEGE AND EXPERIMENT STATION TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES TOWARD MEETING ITS MISSIONS, AND TO ALIGN WITH THE MSU CHOOSING PROMISE STRATEGIC PLAN. THE CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY MSU ALIGN WITH THE BASIC PROGRAM AREAS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN PART OF COA/MAES AND EXTENSION. THE SPECIFICS WILL CONTINUE TO BE REFINED WITH THE NEW PLAN OF WORK PROCESS. THE CRITICAL ISSUES ARE AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM AREAS PROVIDE SPECIFIC SUPPORT FOR THE CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY COA/MAES AND MSUE. ANIMAL SCIENCES ENCOMPASSES RESEARCH, TEACHING, AND ENGAGEMENT PRIORITIES IN ANIMAL HEALTH IN DIRECT CORRELATION WITH HUMANS, LIVEST OCK, OR FOOD PRODUCTS. PRIMARY RESEARCH VEINS REFLECTIVE OF THESE AREAS ARE: VACCINATIONS, NUTRIENT UTILIZATION, REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE, ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY, ZOONOTIC DISEASES, EXTERNAL PARASITES, ANIMAL DISEASES, GENETIC IMPROVEMENT OF ANIMALS, AND MANAGEMENT OF RANGE RESOURCES. MSU RESEARCH, EXTENSION AND COA ARE PARTNERS WITH PRODUCERS TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND MEET THE NEEDS OF MONTANA'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. PLANT SCIENCES: THE BROADER IMPACT OF THE PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCES FIELD IS A LARGER AND HIGHER QUALITY FOOD SUPPLY FOR THE WORLD, AS WELL AS THE IMPROVED ABILITY OF MONTANA FARMERS TO COMPETE IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND STRENGTHEN EXPORT MARKETS FOR U.S. WHEAT AND OTHER PRODUCTS. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES IN PLANT SCIENCES ADDRESS BASIC PLANT SCIENCE, GENOMICS AND PATHOLOGY THAT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON INCREASING YIELD POTENTIAL, IMPROVING WINTER HARDINESS, ENHANCING DISEASE RESISTANCE, AND IMPROVING DUAL-PURPOSE END-USE QUALITY GRAINS. ADDITIONALLY, THE SCIENCE OF GROWINGAND MAINTAINING PLANTS FOR FOOD, ENJOYMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO BE OF PRIMARY SIGNIFICANCE TO COA, MAES, AND EXTENSION EFFORTS. MSU EXTENSION'S HORTICULTURE PROGRAMS, PUBLICATIONS AND LINKS PROVIDE EXPERT YARD, GARDEN AND URBAN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT MONTANA. FARM, RANCH, AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT: COA, MAES AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL SUPPORT MONTANANS IN MANAGING THEIR FARMS, RANCHES, AND SIMILAR ENTERPRISES AS BUSINESSES. BEST PRACTICES, CONTRACTS, ESTATE PLANNING, MARKETING, TAXATION, ACCOUNTING, OPERATIONAL PLANNING, BUDGETING, AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND COMMODITY SUPPORT PROGRAMS, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE FOR AGRICULTURE ARE ALL COVERED THROUGH EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT MONTANA'S NUMBER ONE INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT: AN INCREASE IN PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT FOOD SAFETY, QUALITY, COST, BIODIVERSITY, AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES SUCH AS SOIL, AIR, AND WATER QUALITY IS PUSHING SCIENTISTS IMPROVE INTEGRATED PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DISTRIBUTION OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS AS LOW-IMPACT PEST CONTROL OPTIONS PROMOTES SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES. PRODUCERS AND RESEARCHERS CONTINUE TO EVALUATE NEW INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) METHODOLOGIES SO THEY CAN MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE POSITION IN U.S. AND WORLD MARKETS WHILE HELPING ALLEVIATE GLOBAL HUNGER. THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT REMAINS A CONSISTENTLY CRITICAL FIELD AS INVASIVE SPECIES CONTINUE TO THREATEN MONTANA'S WILD AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS AS WELL AS THE GLOBAL SAFETY OF THE STATE'S FOOD EXPORTS. ENERGY <(>&<)> NATURAL RESOURCES: ENERGY PRODUCTION AND NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN MONTANA'S HISTORY AND CONTINUES TO BE A PRIORITY FOR EXTENSION AND MAES. IN ADDITION, FORESTS COVER LARGE AREAS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMIC BASE OF THE STATE WHILE ALSO SERVING AS A CRITICAL NATURALRESOURCE FOR WILDLIFE, RECREATION, TOURISM, AND CULTURAL PURPOSES. MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHIP IS REQUIRED TO MAXIMIZE POTENTIAL OUTPUTS, AS WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY, AND A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. WATER QUALITY AFFECTS ALL ENTITIES AND REQUIRES INTENTIONAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. RANGELAND ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF INVASIVE SPECIES IS ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT. EXTENSION AND MAES PROVIDE UNBIASED, SCIENCE-BASED RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH RELATED TO PRESERVING AND SUPPORTING THE BEST USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES. YOUTH AND FAMILY DEVELOPMENT: POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OCCURS THROUGH PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES, CHOICES, RELATIONSHIPS, AND THE SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR YOUTH TO FULLY PARTICIPATE. YOUTH DEVELOPMENT TAKES PLACE IN FAMILIES, PEER GROUPS, SCHOOLS, NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES. ACROSS THE STATE, FAMILIES ARE CONCERNED WITH HELPING YOUTH BUILD SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE TO BECOME COMPETENT, CONTRIBUTING, AND CARING CITIZENS. MSU EXTENSION PROVIDES THE SUPPORT AND FRAMEWORK FOR MONTANA'S LARGEST YOUTH DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION, MONTANA 4-H. MSU EXTENSION AND MAES RECOGNIZE THAT FAMILIES NOT ALL THE SAME AND OFFER RESOURCES AND TRAINING TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE DIVERSE SITUATIONS. MONTANANS DESIRE RESOURCES THAT HELP THEM BECOME BETTER CAREGIVERS FOR ELDERLY OR DISABLED FRIENDS AND FAMILY; AND TO SUPPORT FAMILY MEMBERS, OFTEN GRANDCHILDREN, WHO ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES. THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR OWN AGING PROCESS AND VALUE RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE, HELP MANAGE THEIR PERSONAL FINANCES, CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH OF THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND PREPARE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR ESTATES. THEY OFTEN LOOK TO MSU EXTENSION FOR SOLUTIONS AND RESOURCES. HEALTHY LIVING, NUTRITION<(>&<)> FOOD SAFETY: IN MONTANA, HEART DISEASE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH WHILE DIABETES, STROKE, OSTEOPOROSIS, AND HYPERTENSION, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND EARLY DETECTION OF SYMPTOMS CAN PREVENT OR DELAY THESE DISEASES SAVING MILLIONS IN HEALTH CARE COSTS WHILE IMPROVING LIFE QUALITY AND ABILITY TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT. UTILIZING ITS NETWORK ACROSS THE STATE AND THE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS WITH AGENTS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES, MSU EXTENSION WORKS WITH THE MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND OTHER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING IN EVERY COUNTY AND RESERVATION. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: MONTANA'S LARGE SIZE AND SMALL POPULATION SPREAD OVER A WIDE RANGE OF LANDSCAPES CREATES UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES. MSU EXTENSION AGENTS LIVE AND WORK IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AND PROVIDE A HISTORICAL, TRUSTED LINK CONNECTING LEADERS AND INTEREST GROUPS WITH A FOCUS ON EFFORTS TOWARD COMMUNITY VITALITY.

STAFF COULD EXPLORE POTENTIAL NEW VOLUNTEER AUDIENCES, TO INCLUDE ADULT RESIDENTS OF PUBLIC HOUSING COMMUNITIES NEEDING TO FULFIL THE COMMUNITY SERVICE REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO REMAIN A TENANT IN GOOD STANDING, AMERICORPS/VISTA, UVI STUDENTS, TEENS AND PARTNER AGENCIES. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER CES, AES AND ACADEMIC PROGRAMS, 4-H WILL CREATE SPECIAL INTEREST PROGRAMMING FOCUSED ON SMALL LIVESTOCK, DISTANCE LEARNING AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE. A HEALTHY, WELL-NOURISHED POPULATION A HEALTHY, WELL-NOURISHED POPULATION PROGRAM PROVIDES COMMUNITY-BASED NUTRITION AND LIFESTYLE EDUCATION TO ALL U.S. VIRGIN ISLAND RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY RESIDENTS AT HIGH RISK, INCLUDING LOW-INCOME AUDIENCES. THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED THROUGH WORKSHOPS, CLASSES, AND DEMONSTRATIONS. THE PROGRAM WILL ADDRESS AND DEVELOP CULTURALLY SENSITIVE NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATIONAL PRODUCTS AND RESOURCES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO NUTRITION PROFESSIONALS, STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC. THE FOCUS WILL BE TO EDUCATE LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ABOUT HEALTHY LIFESTYLES IN ORDER TO HELP PREVENT NUTRITION RELATED DISEASES (DIABETES, HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, HYPERTENSION, AND OBESITY) IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN. COMPUTER TRAINING AND TECHNOLOGY THE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY TRAINING WILL INCREASE PARTICIPANTS' KNOWLEDGE AND USAGE OF RELEVANT TO INCLUDE INTRODUCTORY COMPUTER CLASSES ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS, MICROSOFT WORD, AND E-MAIL/INTERNET USAGE. DUE TO COVID-19, WORKSHOPS AND COURSES WILL BE CONDUCTED VIRTUALLY, WHEN POSSIBLE. TRAINING VIDEOS WILL BE CREATED TO ALLOW DISTANCE LEARNING.

FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION THE FOOD SAFETY EDUCATION AND EFNEP PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFE FOOD HANDLING AND PREPARATION IN HOME KITCHENS; AS WELL AS EDUCATING LOW INCOME FAMILIES ABOUT BASIC NUTRITION AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE PRACTICES. EXTENSION EDUCATORS WILL WORK TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE CAUSES OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS AND MICROORGANISMS THAT MAY MAKE FOOD UNSAFE WHEN BASIC FOOD SAFETY TECHNIQUES ARE NOT FOLLOWED. THE PROGRAM WILL BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH WORKSHOPS, CLASSES, AND DEMONSTRATIONS. THE LOCATION WHERE THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED INCLUDES SCHOOLS, DAY-CARE CENTERS, CHURCHES, SENIOR CENTERS, COMMUNITY CENTERS, AND HEALTH CLINICS. MARKETABLE SKILLS FOR LIMITED RESOURCE RESIDENTS THE FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES STAFF WILL OFFER WORKSHOPS, SHORT COURSES AND ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE CAREER OPTIONS, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND WORKFORCE PREPARATION. PROGRAMMING WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON SHORT COURSES THAT TEACH MARKETABLE SKILLS. USING VOLUNTEERS WOULD ALLOW A VERY SMALL STAFF TO MAXIMIZE AND MULTIPLY RESOURCES WHILE REACHING A GREATER NUMBER OF INTERESTED CLIENTELE. PROVIDING INNOVATIVE, INTERACTIVE, NON-FORMAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE RESIDENTS IS EVEN MORE CRITICAL DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE TWO RECENT HURRICANES AND COVID-19, WHICH EXACERBATED THE EXISTING, LONG-TERM CIRCUMSTANCES. PROTECTING THE VI NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT CRITICALLY LINKED VI TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS NEED PROTECTION. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES ENCOURAGE THE ADOPTION OF SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE AND WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO PRESERVE ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES BASE, ASSIST POST-HURRICANE RECOVERY, RESTORE POST-HURRICANE LANDSCAPES, CONSERVE CULTURAL AND NATURAL HISTORY RESOURCES IN RECREATIONAL AREAS, AND STIMULATE/GROW A VITAL TOURISM/ECOTOURISM INDUSTRY. EXTENSION EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES PROMOTE LEARNING AND INFORM DECISION-MAKING BY CITIZENS, PUBLIC OFFICIALS, RESOURCE MANAGERS, FARMERS, DEVELOPERS, EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS TO FOSTER AND PROMOTE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF TERRESTRIAL PLANT RESOURCES, ETHNOBOTANY, WATERSHED PROCESSES IMPACTED BY HUMANS, HOW TO MINIMIZE NONPOINT SOURCE (NPS) POLLUTION OF GROUND OR SURFACE WATERS, LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES, HEALTHY HOME STRATEGIES AND CLIMATE-RELATED RESEARCH FINDINGS TO ENABLE ADAPTATION TO PREDICTED CLIMATE CHANGE CONDITIONS. SMALL LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION MANY PRODUCERS OPERATE THEIR ENTERPRISES ON A PART-TIME BASIS. THIS APPROACH OFTEN LEADS TO IMPROPER OR INADEQUATE: HOUSING FACILITIES; PASTURE USAGE; ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION; AND RECORDKEEPING; WHICH RESULTS IN INFERTILITY, POOR GROWTH, PARASITISM AND A GENERALLY UNPRODUCTIVE AND UNPROFITABLE ENTERPRISE. MOST OF THE MEATS AND EGGS SOLD AND CONSUMED IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS ARE IMPORTED AT A LOW COST MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL PRODUCERS TO COMPETE BUT THE PUBLIC IS INTERESTED IN BUYING MORE LOCAL PRODUCTS FOR BETTER TASTE AND FRESHNESS. MARKETING EDUCATION PROGRAMS WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH A FOCUS ON QUALITY STANDARDS, AS WELL EDUCATING CONSUMERS ON THE AVAILABILITY AND BENEFITS OF PURCHASING AND CONSUMING LOCALLY PRODUCED ANIMALS AND DERIVED PRODUCTS. SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE THE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE PROGRAM WILL EDUCATE AND ENCOURAGE FARMERS TO ADOPT SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE, ECONOMICALLY VIABLE, AND ENHANCE THE OVERALL WELLBEING OF THE TERRITORY. THE LONG TERM SUCCESS OF LOCAL FARMS DEPENDS UPON EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT WILL DISSEMINATE TO PRODUCERS RECOMMENDED RESEARCH-BASED INFORMATION ON (A) MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES, (B) FARM FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL PLANNING, ORGANIZING, MANAGING, AND RECORDKEEPING PRACTICES, (C) ENHANCING WATER RESOURCES, (D) ALTERNATIVE ENTERPRISES AND COMMODITIES, AND (E) VALUE-ADDED TECHNOLOGIES. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF WORKSHOPS, SHORTCOURSES, LECTURES, DEMONSTRATIONS, ETC., FARMERS WILL BE TRAINED AND ENCOURAGED TO ADOPT BEST MANAGEMENT, PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, AND MARKETING PRACTICES. TROPICAL HORTICULTURE TROPICAL HORTICULTURE - CES URBAN GARDENING PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION, EDUCATION, AND TECHNICAL ADVICE TO COMMERCIAL GROWERS, HOME GARDENERS, NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGENCIES, AND RESIDENTS ABOUT CARING FOR AND CULTIVATING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. URBAN FORESTRY BECAUSE OF LIMITED LAND SPACE ON EACH ISLAND, MANAGEMENT DECISIONS CONCERNING THE TERRITORY'S TREE POPULATIONS HAVE BECOME MORE DIFFICULT. LAWMAKERS CONTINUE TO SEEK A BALANCE BETWEEN CHANGING ECONOMIC FORCES, ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND DEMOGRAPHICS. MANY OF THE MATERIALS ENTERING THE WASTE STREAM CAN BE REUSED/RECYCLED TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENTREPRENEURS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. RECENT CATEGORY 5 HURRICANES HAVE DEVASTATED THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, DESTROYING AND DAMAGING MANY TREES THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY. OUR COMMUNITY'S ABILITY TO PREPARE AND RESPOND TO THESE DISASTERS WAS HAMPERED BY A LACK OF UTILIZING UP TO DATE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. A TREE LAW WAS RECENTLY PASSED AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD IMPROVE THE URBAN FOREST, AID IN OUR RECOVERY EFFORTS AND HELP TO RESTORE A MORE RESILIENT URBAN FOREST. THE URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM WILL ASSIST PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGENCIES, POLICY MAKERS, COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE PRESERVATION, CONSERVATION, AND MANAGEMENT OF THE URBAN AND SUBURBAN TREE POPULATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bff03c04-091e-21a8-0bee-6e0f5c254706-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23SLBCXXXXG004_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735941, "Award ID": "NI23SLBCXXXXG003", "Award Amount": 3835022.18, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.511", "Description": "SOUTH DAKOTA COMMUNITIES NEED ASSISTANCE TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, HUMAN, AND ECONOMIC L ANDSCAPE.

CHANGES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THIS AGING DEMOGRAPHIC ARE EXPECTED IN HEALTH AND WELLNESS; HOME AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS; AGRICULTURE; COMMUNITY LIFE AND THE ECONOMY. TOO MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL CRISIS BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE SAVINGS AND TOO MUCH DEBT. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION STRATEGIES CAN ENHANCE FAMILY LIFE ISSUES SUCH AS BUILDING FINANCIAL SECURITY, COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP, YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AND CONNECT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT RESOURCES.  HEART DISEASE, CANCER, STROKE, AND DIABETES ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOP LEADING SEVEN CAUSES OF DEATH IN SOUTH DAKOTA AND STRESS-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE ON THE RISE. LIVING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE GREATLY REDUCES A PERSON'S RISK FOR DEVELOPING CHRONIC DISEASE. LOCAL GARDENS, HIGH-TUNNELS, AND GREENHOUSE FACILITIES HELP INCREASE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION IN THE STATE. AQUAPONICS, A SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION METHOD THAT COMBINES ADVANCED AQUACULTURE WITH HYDROPONICS, IS ON THE RISE IN SD TO MEET THE NEED FOR MORE FRESH PRODUCE. NATURAL FERMENTATION PROCESSES REPLACE CHEMICAL ADDITIVES FOR EXTENDING SHELF-LIFE OF FOODS AND BEVERAGES. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE DIETARY AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES CAN REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF CHRONIC DISEASE ACROSS THE STATE'S POPULATION.  REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE BUILDS THE SOIL THROUGH PROPER MANAGEMENT WHICH INCLUDES MINIMIZING OR ELIMINATING TILLAGE, DIVERSIFIED ROTATIONS, AND INTEGRATING LIVESTOCK INTO CROPPING SYSTEMS, WHICH RESULTS IN INCREASED TOPSOIL, SOIL CARBON, AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY. USING REGENERATIVE METHODS CAN ALLOW SOUTH DAKOTA FARMERS TO PRIORITIZE CARING FOR THE SOIL TO PUT HIGH-QUALITY, NUTRITIOUS FOOD DIRECTLY INTO THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO LACK ACCESS. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION STRATEGIES LEAD TO INCREASED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF PLANT DISEASES, PESTS, AND NEW PLANT VARIETIES. FARMERS RELY ON THE DISSEMINATION OF SCIENCE-BASED KNOWLEDGE ON SOIL FERTILITY, PRECISION AGRICULTURE, GENETICS, GENOMICS, HORTICULTURE, ENVIRONMENTAL PRESERVATION, WEED SCIENCE, AND PRESERVING WATER QUALITY.  DUE TO SHIFTING POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS, AND CHANGING CULTURAL AND SOCIETAL STANDARDS, THE PERCEPTIONS OF LIVESTOCK UTILIZATION AND HUSBANDRY CONTINUE TO BE UNDER SCRUTINY. IN ADDITION, THE DEMAND TO PRODUCE MORE FOOD WITH FEWER RESOURCES CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE TO LIVESTOCK HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY. ACCORDING TO THE USDA CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE, THE AVERAGE AGE OF U.S. PRODUCERS IS 58.3. PRODUCERS WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT CROP AND LIVESTOCK REINTEGRATION, PRECISION LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION IN CONFINED AND RANGE SETTINGS, AS WELL AS FACTORS THAT IMPACT EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR FEEDING PROGRAMS. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION STRATEGIES CAN INCREASE PROFITABILITY, OPTIMIZE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, ENHANCE LEARNING COMMUNITIES, AND INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE CONSUMER AND FOOD SERVICE SIDE OF THE BEEF INDUSTRY.  THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 19 MILLION ACRES OF CROPLAND AND 23 MILLION ACRES OF PERMANENT PASTURE AND RANGELAND IN SOUTH DAKOTA. RANGELAND IS THE LIFELINE OF STREAMS, PONDS, AND LAKES, AND IT IS A SOURCE OF WILDLIFE HABITAT, RECREATION, AND SCENIC BEAUTY. AS AN AGRICULTURAL RESOURCE, CROPLAND HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC, AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL WELL-BEING OF THE STATE.

THERE ARE EXTENSION OFFICES LOCATED IN EACH OF OHIO'S 88 COUNTIES DELIVERING PROGRAMMING IN 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, AND FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES. ADDITIONALLY, EXTENSION PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSED AROUND FIVE CRITICAL ISSUES: 1. HEALTH AND WELLNESS - OHIOANS SHOULD HAVE A POSITIVE STATE OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, WHICH INCLUDES THE PREVENTION OF DISEASE, BY CREATING AND SUPPORTING HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS IN HOMES, SCHOOLS, WORKPLACES, AND COMMUNITIES. WE ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THROUGH A FOCUS ON TOPICS THAT INCLUDE DISEASE PREVENTION, SAFETY RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH, AND STRESS REDUCTION. EXTENSION EFFORTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO LEAD TO POSITIVE BEHAVIOR CHANGE, ENABLING PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE AND MANAGE POSITIVE PERSONAL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH AND WELLNESS OUTCOMES. THIS PLAN OF WORK WILL EXPLORE HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AND LITERACY, HEALTH INEQUITY, CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY PREVENTION, COMMUNITY NUTRITION EDUCATION, AND FARM SAFETY. 2. ECONOMIC VITALITY - IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL OHIOANS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PURSUE AND SUSTAIN ECONOMIC WELL-BEING. OHIOANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENJOY FINANCIAL SECURITY TODAY, SAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE, AND SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE FISCAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE. THROUGH MONEY MANAGEMENT EDUCATION, INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, BUSINESS MANAGERS, AND COMMUNITY LEADERS WILL IMPROVE THEIR FINANCIAL LITERACY, DECISION MAKING, AND ABILITY TO MANAGE RESOURCES. PROGRAMMING RELATED TO ECONOMIC VITALITY INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: BUSINESS RETENTION AND EXPANSION, ENHANCING RURAL ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, INCREASING BROADBAND ACCESS IN RURAL AREAS, AND FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCY. 3. FOOD SECURITY AND PRODUCTION - A SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM NOT ONLY BENEFITS PRODUCERS AND PROTECTS CONSUMERS, BUT ALSO ENSURES A SAFE FOOD SUPPLY WHILE FEEDING A GROWING POPULATION. OSU EXTENSION CONDUCTS RESEARCH AND EDUCATES PRODUCERS ABOUT BEST PRACTICES THAT INCREASE YIELD AND PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES CONTINUALLY INFLUENCE PRODUCTION PRACTICES AND THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT PRODUCERS ARE EXPECTED TO BRING TO MARKET. USING SCIENCE-BASED INFORMATION, OHIO STATE HELPS CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND POLICY MAKERS BECOME MORE INFORMED ABOUT DECISIONS RELATED TO FOOD AND THE WAY IT IS PRODUCED, PROCESSED, DISTRIBUTED, STORED, PREPARED, AND CONSUMED. ENGAGING CITIZENS IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THEIR FOOD CREATES A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SOLVING FOOD SECURITY ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, TEACHING CITIZENS TO GROW SOME OF THEIR OWN FOOD CAN HELP IMPROVE FOOD QUALITY, ELIMINATE FOOD DESERTS, AND INCREASE COMMUNITY FOOD SECURITY. WE WILL EXPLORE ISSUES RELATED TO MITIGATING FOOD INSECURITY THROUGH COMMUNITY SERVICE AND FOOD PRODUCTION EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND FOOD SYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY. WE ALSO LOOK AT ISSUES OF FOOD PRODUCTION INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIGITAL AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS, CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE, IMPROVED FOOD ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION, CROP IMPROVEMENT AND RESILIENCY, WEED AND PEST CONTROL, AND PLANT BREEDING AND DISEASE RESISTANCE STUDIES. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS CRITICAL ISSUE ARE PROGRAMS RELATED TO INCREASING FOOD SAFETY AND FOODBORNE ILLNESS REDUCTION. 4. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY - OHIO STATE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERTS EDUCATE OHIOANS ABOUT THEIR INDIVIDUAL IMPACT IN A GLOBAL COMMUNITY, WHILE TEACHING THEM TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE PLANET. OHIO STATE PROGRAMS HELP PEOPLE MAKE MORE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT HOW THEY CAN PROMOTE AND SUSTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY.
