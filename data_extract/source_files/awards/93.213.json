AMERICAN YOUTH LIVING WELL (A YO LI) - ABSTRACT/SUMMARY THE ONGOING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AMONG NATIVE AMERICANS MANIFESTS IN EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH RATES MENTAL, EMOTIONAL, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS SUCH AS ANXIETY, STRESS, DEPRESSION, SUBSTANCE USE, AND SUICIDE IN NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH AS YOUNG AS 10. THE VIRULENCE OF COVID-19 FOR OLDER PEOPLE HAS HIT NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY HARD, AND THE LOSS OF TRIBAL ELDERS AND NATIVE SPEAKERS HAS TAKEN AN INCALCULABLE TOLL ON THE CULTURAL TIES OF LANGUAGE AND TRADITION THAT FLOW FROM ELDER NATIVE AMERICAN GENERATIONS TO THE YOUNG. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED THE SUFFERING OF NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF ALL AGES, WHO REPORTED SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS THAT INCLUDE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, LIFE STRESSORS, SUBSTANCE USE (ALCOHOL, DRUGS, COMMERCIAL TOBACCO USE), AND SUICIDE LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THE DEVASTATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES FROM COVID-19, COUPLED WITH BOTH A RECENT AND LONG HISTORY OF RACISM AND CRIMES AGAINST NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HAS HAD AN ALARMING EFFECT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, SUICIDE FATALITIES FOR NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH BETWEEN THE AGES OF 15\u201319 WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT OF NON-HISPANIC WHITES. FOR SOME NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES, SUICIDE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUTH AGES 10-14. MOREOVER, NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH BEGIN TO USE ALCOHOL, OTHER SUBSTANCES AND COMMERCIAL TOBACCO AT YOUNGER AGES (AROUND THE AGE OF 11), AND AT HIGHER RATES, THAN ALL OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS. FOR A POPULATION ALREADY STRUGGLING, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS CALAMITOUS, INCREASING THE ALREADY HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS OF NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH. THUS, INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH MENTAL, EMOTIONAL, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. TO MEET THIS URGENT NEED, OUR OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE IS TO LEVERAGE THE EMPIRICALLY PROVEN, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, SCHOOL BASED, TALKING CIRCLE INTERVENTION TO PROMOTE THE MENTAL, EMOTIONAL, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE (RURAL VS. URBAN) NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH. THIS STUDY, \u201cTALKING CIRCLE FOR NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH LIVING WELL (A YO LI)\u201d USES A COMMUNITY BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR) APPROACH TO EVALUATE TALKING CIRCLE EFFECTIVENESS, PARTNERING WITH THE UNITED KEETOOWAH BAND (UKB) OF CHEROKEE TRIBE IN OKLAHOMA, WITH MEMBERS LIVING IN TWO GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE AREAS, RURAL AND URBAN. \u201cA YO LI\u201d IN THE UKB TRIBAL LANGUAGE MEANS \u201cYOUTH\u201d. THE TALKING CIRCLE INTERVENTION WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AS AN AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM IN EACH OF THE PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS. AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE AN IDEAL SETTING FOR THE TALKING CIRCLE INTERVENTION. AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE PREFERRED BY PARENTS, STUDENTS, AND TEACHERS IN MANY NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES, AS THEY PROVIDE STRUCTURED, EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTIVITIES FOR YOUTH AFTER REGULAR SCHOOL HOURS, WHILE PARENTS/GUARDIANS ARE STILL BUSY WITH WORK OR OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES.

TOXICITIES ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG THERAPIES FOR KNEE OA PAIN HAVE CAUSED THE NUMBER OF RECOMMENDED TREATMENTS TO DECREASE OVER TIME. THERE IS NOW A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH KNEE OA, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE COMORBIDITIES THAT COMPLICATE TREATMENT SELECTION ARE HIGHLY PREVALENT IN THIS OLDER ADULT POPULATION. TAI CHI, A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL PRACTICE THAT INTEGRATES PHYSICAL, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND BEHAVIORAL COMPONENTS, HAS EXHIBITED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN CHRONIC KNEE OA PAIN CONDITIONS. THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES STRONGLY RECOMMEND TAI CHI AS AN INTERVENTION FOR KNEE OA. RECENT STUDIES CONDUCTED DURING THE PANDEMIC SUGGEST THAT REMOTELY DELIVERED TAI CHI IS A PROMISING AND SCALABLE STRATEGY FOR KNEE OA PAIN. HOWEVER, CRITICAL GAPS REMAIN AS TO THE REAL-WORLD EFFECTIVENESS OF REMOTE TAI CHI FOR KNEE OA AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS MULTIPLE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. WE PROPOSE AN EMBEDDED, PRAGMATIC, RANDOMIZED TRIAL THAT WILL COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF A 3-MONTH TWICE WEEKLY REMOTELY DELIVERED WEB-BASED TAI CHI INTERVENTION VERSUS ROUTINE CARE IN 20-25 CLINICS ACROSS FOUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS (TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES HEALTH, AND CLEVELAND CLINIC OHIO AND CLEVELAND CLINIC FLORIDA) IN FOUR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS (EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, NORTHEAST OHIO, SOUTHERN FLORIDA).

EARLY INTERVENTION, CONNECTING VETERANS TO MULTIMODAL PAIN TREATMENT, IS IMPORTANT FOR VETERANS TRANSITIONING FROM MILITARY TO CIVILIAN HEALTHCARE TO ARREST WORSENING PAIN AND THE INITIATION OR EXACERBATION OF RISKY SUBSTANCE USE. SCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT (SBIRT-PM) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL FOR THIS PURPOSE; AND CASE MANAGERS IN THE POST-9/11 MILITARY2VA (M2VA) PROGRAM ARE PERFECTLY POSITIONED TO DELIVER IT. M2VA PROGRAMS ARE AT EACH VA MEDICAL CENTER AND ARE CHARGED WITH COORDINATING VA HEALTH CARE FOR ALL SERVICE MEMBERS SEPARATING FROM THE MILITARY. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SBIRT-PM BY M2VA LIKELY REQUIRES FACILITATION BECAUSE THE SOCIAL WORKERS AND NURSES WHO PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT ARE NOT OTHERWISE DIRECTED TO SPECIFIC TRAINING IN MULTIMODAL PAIN CARE OR ADDICTION SERVICES, AND THEY ARE NOT ROUTINELY PROVIDED FACILITY SUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT THAT REQUIRES COORDINATION ACROSS PAIN TREATMENT MODALITIES AND SYSTEMS. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OF THE M2VA PROGRAM, WE PROPOSE A 2-COHORT, CLUSTER RANDOMIZED, TYPE 2 HYBRID TRIAL TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS, COST EFFECTIVENESS AND PATIENT-LEVEL EFFECTS OF AN IMPLEMENTATION FACILITATION STRATEGY FOR SBIRT-PM. INFORMED BY A 1-YEAR PLANNING PHASE, WE WILL RANDOMLY ASSIGN 28 VA MEDICAL CENTERS TO ONE OF TWO CONDITIONS. M2VA CASE MANAGERS IN SITES WITHIN THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION WILL RECEIVE TRAINING IN SBIRT-PM FOLLOWED BY IMPLEMENTATION FACILITATION (CASE FINDING REPORT, CONSULTATION GROUPS, AUDIT AND FEEDBACK, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROBLEM-SOLVING SUPPORT) DELIVERED BY AN EXTERNAL FACILITATION TEAM (WITH PAIN, ADDICTION, CASE MANAGEMENT, AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE EXPERTISE) AND INTERNAL FACILITATORS AT EACH MEDICAL CENTER.

LBP IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF AMBULATORY CARE VISITS TO US PHYSICIANS; UNFORTUNATELY, THESE VISITS OFTEN RESULT IN TREATMENTS SUCH AS OPIOIDS THAT CAN LEAD TO MORE HARM THAN BENEFIT. IN 2017 THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS (ACP) GUIDELINE FOR LBP RECOMMENDED PATIENTS RECEIVE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS AS A FIRST-LINE TREATMENT BUT STOPPED SHORT OF OFFERING SOLUTIONS REGARDING HOW SUCH TREATMENTS SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO ROUTINE PATIENT CARE. ROADMAPS EXIST FOR MULTI-DISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIVE CARE THAT INCLUDES DOCTORS OF CHIROPRACTIC AND PHYSICAL THERAPISTS, WELL-TRAINED PRIMARY CONTACT CLINICIANS WITH SPECIFIC EXPERTISE IN THE TREATMENT OF MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS, AS FIRST LINE PROVIDERS FOR LBP. THESE CLINICIANS ROUTINELY EMPLOY MANY OF THE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES RECOMMENDED BY THE ACP GUIDELINE, INCLUDING SPINAL MANIPULATION AND EXERCISE. IMPORTANT FOUNDATIONAL WORK CONDUCTED BY MEMBERS OF THE STUDY TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SUCH CARE IS FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND RESULTS IN IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTION, LESS PAIN, FEWER OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS, AND REDUCED UTILIZATION OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES. HOWEVER, THIS TREATMENT APPROACH FOR LBP HAS YET TO BE WIDELY IMPLEMENTED OR VALIDATED USING RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC METHODS. OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO REFINE AND IMPLEMENT A MULTIDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIVE CARE MODEL FOR LBP (MC2LBP) IN 3 ACADEMIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS (HCS) AND THEN EVALUATE ITS EFFECTIVENESS BY COMPARING IT TO USUAL MEDICAL CARE IN PATIENTS AGE 18 AND OLDER SUFFERING FROM LBP. COMPLETION OF PROJECT STUDY AIMS WILL BEGIN WITH A ONE-YEAR UG3 PLANNING PHASE INVOLVING COMPLETION OF 22 MILESTONES IN 2 CATEGORIES OF PHASED ACTIVITIES - MODEL IMPLEMENTATION AND CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN. UH3 STUDY AIMS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED USING A PRAGMATIC, CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED, CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN. THE STUDY WILL BE MANAGED THROUGH A CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER AND DATA COORDINATING CENTER, BOTH HOUSED AT THE DUKE CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, IN COLLABORATION WITH DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK MEDICAL CENTER AND THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA. DURING THE PLANNING PHASE, WE WILL BUILD IMPLEMENTATION INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THREE HCS, FINALIZE THE CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL, AND COMPLETE THE TASKS NECESSARY TO TRANSITION FROM THE UG3 TO UH3 PHASE. THE UH3 PHASE WILL BE USED TO: 1) OPERATIONALIZE THE INTEGRATION OF NEW ORGANIZATIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REQUIRED TO FACILITATE IMPLEMENTATION OF MC2LBP AT INTERVENTION CLINICS; 2) DETERMINE THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF MC2LBP VS USUAL CARE; 3) ESTIMATE AND COMPARE MEDICAL RESOURCE USE AND COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING MC2LBP; AND 4) EVALUATE PATIENT, PROVIDER, SYSTEM AND POLICY LEVEL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO IMPLEMENTING MC2LBP, USING A MIXED METHOD, PROCESS EVALUATION APPROACH.

WE CAPITALIZE ON MPIS' INTERDISCIPLINARY EXPERTISE IN MBIS, EWB, MEASUREMENT, NEUROIMAGING, AND INTER-GENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION AND TAP OUR BROAD NETWORK OF COLLEAGUES ACROSS DISCIPLINES. TO PROMOTE RESEARCH LINKING MBIS AND EWB, NEW AVENUES AND RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. FIRST, WE NEED TO MORE FULLY CHARACTERIZE THE DIMENSIONS COMPRISING THE UMBRELLA CONSTRUCT OF EWB. SECOND, WE NEED TO IDENTIFY AND/OR CREATE PSYCHOMETRICALLY SOUND INSTRUMENTS THAT FULLY CAPTURE THESE DIMENSIONS OF WELLBEING. THIRD, WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THE BIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH MBIS PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN EWB. INCLUSIVITY IS ESSENTIAL; IN ADDITION TO THE MORE TYPICAL LIFESPAN APPROACH, WE WILL FOCUS ON POPULATIONS OFTEN EXCLUDED FROM THIS AREA OF WORK BY APPLYING A DEVELOPMENTAL AND INTER-GENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION LENS THAT INCLUDES BOTH CHILD AND CAREGIVER POPULATIONS AS CRITICAL TO WORK THAT MOVES THE FIELD VERTICALLY. CAPITALIZING ON THIS CRITICAL MOMENT IN INTERVENTION SCIENCE, WE WILL ESTABLISH A NETWORK THAT BRINGS TOGETHER A CORPS OF RESEARCHERS WHO CAN LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER'S WORK TO COLLECTIVELY ESTABLISH INNOVATIVE AND RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC BASES FOR A NEW GENERATION OF EWB RESEARCH. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE NETWORK IS TO PROVIDE RESEARCHERS WITH THE CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL RESOURCES TO APPROPRIATELY ASSESS EWB AND TO PROMOTE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH THAT ILLUMINATES THE ROLE OF EWB IN MBIS AS BOTH AN OUTCOME ITSELF AND AS A MECHANISM IN IMPROVING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL CREATE A TAXONOMY OF COMPONENTS AND COLLECTION OF MEASURES FOR EWB THAT SPANS THE LIFE COURSE, ESTABLISH A TOOLKIT BY REFINING MEASUREMENT TOOLS AND APPROACHES APPROPRIATE FOR POPULATIONS ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE, AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH MBIS PROMOTE EWB. WE WILL ACHIEVE THESE AIMS THROUGH A SERIES OF ACTIVITIES THAT INCLUDE TARGETED STRATEGIES TO ENGAGE A BROAD NETWORK OF SCHOLARS INCLUDING EARLY CAREER, FOCUSED MEETINGS FOR CO-LEARNING AND SHARING FINDINGS, AND ROBUST MULTI-MEDIA DISSEMINATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f7d4a874-2ab3-85f8-4c06-002c8728886d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U24AT011281_7529"}, {"internal_id": 137900757, "Award ID": "U24AT011189", "Award Amount": 2023147.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-08", "CFDA Number": "93.213", "Description": "2/2: IMPACT-LBP DCC - LOW BACK PAIN (LBP) IS A KEY SOURCE OF MEDICAL COSTS AND DISABILITY, IMPACTING OVER 31 MILLION AMERICANS AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND RESULTING IN $100-$200 BILLION PER YEAR IN TOTAL HEALTHCARE COSTS. LBP IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF AMBULATORY CARE VISITS TO US PHYSICIANS; UNFORTUNATELY, THESE VISITS OFTEN RESULT IN TREATMENTS SUCH AS OPIOIDS THAT CAN LEAD TO MORE HARM THAN BENEFIT. IN 2017 THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS (ACP) GUIDELINE FOR LBP RECOMMENDED PATIENTS RECEIVE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS AS A FIRST-LINE TREATMENT BUT STOPPED SHORT OF OFFERING SOLUTIONS REGARDING HOW SUCH TREATMENTS SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO ROUTINE PATIENT CARE. ROADMAPS EXIST FOR MULTI-DISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIVE CARE THAT INCLUDES DOCTORS OF CHIROPRACTIC AND PHYSICAL THERAPISTS, WELL-TRAINED PRIMARY CONTACT CLINICIANS WITH SPECIFIC EXPERTISE IN THE TREATMENT OF MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS, AS FIRST LINE PROVIDERS FOR LBP. THESE CLINICIANS ROUTINELY EMPLOY MANY OF THE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES RECOMMENDED BY THE ACP GUIDELINE, INCLUDING SPINAL MANIPULATION AND EXERCISE. IMPORTANT FOUNDATIONAL WORK CONDUCTED BY MEMBERS OF THE STUDY TEAM HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SUCH CARE IS FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND RESULTS IN IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTION, LESS PAIN, FEWER OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS, AND REDUCED UTILIZATION OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES. HOWEVER, THIS TREATMENT APPROACH FOR LBP HAS YET TO BE WIDELY IMPLEMENTED OR VALIDATED USING RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC METHODS. OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO REFINE AND IMPLEMENT A MULTIDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIVE CARE MODEL FOR LBP (MC2LBP) IN 3 ACADEMIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS (HCS) AND THEN EVALUATE ITS EFFECTIVENESS BY COMPARING IT TO USUAL MEDICAL CARE IN PATIENTS AGE 18 AND OLDER SUFFERING FROM LBP. COMPLETION OF PROJECT STUDY AIMS WILL BEGIN WITH A ONE-YEAR UG3 PLANNING PHASE INVOLVING COMPLETION OF 22 MILESTONES IN 2 CATEGORIES OF PHASED ACTIVITIES - MODEL IMPLEMENTATION AND CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN. UH3 STUDY AIMS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED USING A PRAGMATIC, CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED, CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN. THE STUDY WILL BE MANAGED THROUGH A CLINICAL COORDINATING CENTER AND DATA COORDINATING CENTER, BOTH HOUSED AT THE DUKE CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, IN COLLABORATION WITH DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK MEDICAL CENTER AND THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA. DURING THE PLANNING PHASE, WE WILL BUILD IMPLEMENTATION INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THREE HCS, FINALIZE THE CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL, AND COMPLETE THE TASKS NECESSARY TO TRANSITION FROM THE UG3 TO UH3 PHASE. THE UH3 PHASE WILL BE USED TO: 1) OPERATIONALIZE THE INTEGRATION OF NEW ORGANIZATIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REQUIRED TO FACILITATE IMPLEMENTATION OF MC2LBP AT INTERVENTION CLINICS; 2) DETERMINE THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF MC2LBP VS USUAL CARE; 3) ESTIMATE AND COMPARE MEDICAL RESOURCE USE AND COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING MC2LBP; AND 4) EVALUATE PATIENT, PROVIDER, SYSTEM AND POLICY LEVEL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO IMPLEMENTING MC2LBP, USING A MIXED METHOD, PROCESS EVALUATION APPROACH.

OA RANKS AS THE THIRD MOST COMMON DIAGNOSIS FOR HOSPITAL INPATIENT STAYS WITH 1.25 M PER YEAR, WITH THE KNEE THE MOST COMMONLY AFFECTED WEIGHT-BEARING JOINT. WE ADDRESS KNEE OA DISEASE PREVENTION IN ADULT FEMALES BECAUSE PREVENTION OF OA IS PREFERABLE TO TREATMENT, FEMALES ARE AFFECTED AT NEARLY TWICE THE RATE AS MALES, AND TO DATE INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO SLOW OR STOP KNEE OA PROGRESSION HAVE FAILED. DIETARY WEIGHT LOSS, WITH AND WITHOUT EXERCISE, HAS LEVEL 1 EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR ADULTS WITH KNEE OA AND OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY. REDUCED DEGENERATIVE CARTILAGE CHANGES ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH WEIGHT LOSS, MAKING IT A POSSIBLE PREVENTIVE THERAPY FOR PEOPLE AT RISK FOR KNEE OA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE III, MULTI-SITE (BOSTON, MA, CHAPEL HILL, NC, BROWARD COUNTY, FL, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, AND WINSTON-SALEM, NC) RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL IS TO ESTABLISH THE EFFICACY OF AN INTERVENTION OF DIETARY WEIGHT LOSS, EXERCISE, AND WEIGHT-LOSS MAINTENANCE FOR KNEE OA PREVENTION. WE WILL ESTABLISH EFFICACY IN STRUCTURAL, SYMPTOMATIC, AND MECHANISTIC OUTCOMES COMPARED TO ATTENTION CONTROL, AND DETERMINE THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS NON- PHARMACOLOGIC, NON-SURGICAL INTERVENTION IN PREVENTING INCIDENT KNEE OA IN ADULT FEMALES AGED = 50 YEARS WITH OBESITY AND NO OR INFREQUENT KNEE PAIN, A COHORT AT HIGH RISK FOR KNEE OA.  PARTICIPANTS WILL BE 1,230 AMBULATORY, COMMUNITY DWELLING FEMALES WITH OBESITY (BMI = 30 KG/M2), AND AGED = 50 YEARS. STRUCTURAL AND SYMPTOMATIC ELIGIBILITY WILL BE DETERMINED AT THE INDIVIDUAL KNEE LEVEL. THE ELIGIBLE KNEE WILL HAVE NO RADIOGRAPHIC (KELLGREN LAWRENCE (KL) SCORE = 1) AND NO MRI KNEE OA WITH NO OR INFREQUENT KNEE PAIN (< 15 DAYS/MONTH) IN THE SAME KNEE. THE PRIMARY AIM IS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF A 48-MONTH INTERVENTION OF DIETARY WEIGHT LOSS, EXERCISE, AND WEIGHT-LOSS MAINTENANCE TO AN ATTENTION CONTROL GROUP IN PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRUCTURAL (MRI) KNEE OA USING THE MRI OA KNEE SCORE (MOAKS). SECONDARY AIMS WILL DETERMINE THE INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON THE KNEE INJURY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCORE (KOOS TOTAL), KOOS PAIN, MOBILITY (6 MINUTE WALK DISTANCE), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36). MECHANISTIC SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDE KNEE JOINT COMPRESSIVE FORCES AS A MEASURE OF JOINT LOADING, IL-6 AS AN INFLAMMATORY MEASURE, AND WEIGHT LOSS AND EXERCISE SELF-EFFICACY. WE WILL ALSO ESTABLISH THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS INTERVENTION.  THIS STUDY IS SIGNIFICANT IN THAT IT WILL TEST A CRITICALLY NEEDED PRIMARY PREVENTION INTERVENTION OF DIETARY WEIGHT LOSS, EXERCISE, AND WEIGHT-LOSS MAINTENANCE FOR FEMALES AT RISK FOR KNEE OA.",

STUDIES DATING BACK A CENTURY HAVE SHOWN THAT INSECTS COMBINE MECHANOSENSORY AND OLFACTORY CUES TO NAVIGATE, SURGING UPWIND WHEN DETECTING ODOR BUT GO CROSSWIND OR DOWNWIND WHEN LOSING THE SIGNAL. THEY ALSO USE BILATERAL INFORMATION FROM THEIR TWO ANTENNAE TO TURN TOWARD HIGHER ODOR CONCENTRATIONS. WE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT IN ADDITION TO WIND DIRECTION AND ODOR GRADIENT, FRUIT FLIES DETECT THE DIRECTION OF MOTION OF ODORS, INDEPENDENT OF THE WIND. USING OPTOGENETICS TO DECOUPLE ODOR SIGNAL FROM WIND, WE FOUND THAT FLIES DETECT ODOR MOTION USING THE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS OF THE ODOR SIGNAL BETWEEN THEIR TWO ANTENNAE, SUGGESTING SIMILARITIES WITH MOTION DETECTION IN VISION. MANIPULATING SPATIO-TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS IN VIRTUAL ODOR SIGNALS DEMONSTRATED THAT FLIES INDEED EXPLOIT ODOR MOTION WHEN NAVIGATING ODOR PLUMES. THE FINDING THAT DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER CAN \u2018SMELL\u2019 ODOR MOTION SUGGESTS A NOVEL ROLE FOR BILATERAL SENSING IN OLFACTION AND RAISES THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS FOR THE FIELD: 1) HOW IS ODOR MOTION \u2014 A PREVIOUSLY UNAPPRECIATED OLFACTORY DIRECTIONAL CUE \u2014 INTEGRATED WITH OTHER DIRECTIONAL CUES TO DRIVE OLFACTORY NAVIGATION? 2) WHAT ARE THE INPUTS TO THE ODOR MOTION DETECTOR AND HOW DOES ODOR VALENCE MODULATE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE TO ODOR MOTION? 3) WHAT NEURAL CIRCUITS AND COMPUTATIONS MEDIATE ODOR MOTION DETECTION AND HOW DO THEY COMPARE TO THOSE THAT MEDIATE VISUAL MOTION DETECTION? WE WILL ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS BY COMBINING OPTOGENETIC STIMULATION, NEURON ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS, AND NEUROGENETIC SILENCING WITH THE BEHAVIORAL AND COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK WE USED TO DISCOVER ODOR MOTION SENSING. WITH THIS PLATFORM WE CAN CONTROL, MEASURE, AND PERTURB REAL ODOR AND VIRTUAL ODOR SIGNALS IN CLOSED- AND OPEN-LOOP, DURING OLFACTORY NAVIGATION OF FREELY WALKING FLIES. DROSOPHILA IS PERFECTLY SUITED TO PURSUE THESE GOALS BECAUSE OF 1) THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEURAL CIRCUIT OF THE OLFACTORY PERIPHERY AND INCREASINGLY OF DOWNSTREAM OLFACTORY CENTERS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF A CONNECTOME; AND (2) THE ABILITY TO SELECTIVELY MEASURE AND MANIPULATE THE ACTIVITY OF NEURAL CIRCUITS INVOLVED IN SENSORY PROCESSING AND INTEGRATION. THE FINDING THAT FLIES USE ODOR MOTION DETECTION TO ENHANCE ODOR-GUIDED NAVIGATION REVEALS IMPORTANT GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OLFACTORY NAVIGATION.

CONVENTIONAL OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY MOSTLY RELY ON CALCIUM SIGNALS. HOWEVER, CALCIUM IMAGING CONVEYS ONLY LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT NATURAL SIGNAL PROCESSING IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND IT PROVIDES LITTLE OR NO DATA ON THE INHIBITORY AND EXCITATORY SIGNALS THAT OCCUR CONTINUOUSLY IN MOST NEURONS. IN CONTRAST, VOLTAGE IMAGING ALLOWS A DIRECT MEASURE OF NEURONAL ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY, AND IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS INHERENT TO CALCIUM IMAGING. PARTICULARLY, THE RECENT ADVANCES OF GENETICALLY ENCODED VOLTAGE INDICATORS (GEVIS) HAVE GREATLY EXPANDED THE USE OF VOLTAGE IMAGING IN BRAIN RESEARCH, AND THEIR SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION HAS, IN TURN, MOTIVATED DEVELOPING NEW OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION OPTIMIZED FOR VOLTAGE IMAGING. OPTICAL IMAGING OF NEURONAL ACTION POTENTIALS IS CHALLENGING AS IT REQUIRES A MILLISECOND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. THIS REQUIREMENT BECOMES MORE DEMANDING IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) IMAGING, WHERE MOST OPTICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES RELY ON SCANNING TO ACQUIRE VOLUMETRIC DATA, EITHER POINTWISE LIKE CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY OR PLANES LIKE LIGHT-SHEET MICROSCOPY. THESE SYSTEMS SUFFER FROM A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE IMAGING SPEED AND THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO. IN CONTRAST, LIGHT FIELD IMAGING CAPTURES THE VOLUMETRIC DATA SIMULTANEOUSLY, MAKING IT AN IDEAL STRATEGY FOR 3D IMAGING OF NEURONAL NETWORKS. NONETHELESS, BECAUSE LIGHT FIELD IMAGING RECORDS BOTH THE SPATIAL AND ANGULAR INFORMATION OF LIGHT RAYS, IT TYPICALLY REQUIRES A LARGE-FORMAT IMAGE SENSOR, WHICH HAS A LOW FRAME RATE DUE TO LIMITED ELECTRONIC BANDWIDTH. THE TEMPORAL RESOLUTION ENABLED SO FAR (~TENS OF MILLISECONDS) IS FAR FROM ENOUGH TO RESOLVE THE INDIVIDUAL NEURON FIRING EVENT (~ONE MILLISECOND). THEREFORE, THERE IS AN UNMET NEED TO DEVELOP NEW IMAGING TECHNIQUES TO ENABLE HIGH-SPEED MEASUREMENT OF LARGE-SCALE LIGHT-FIELD DATA. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A LIGHT-FIELD TOMOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPY (LIFT MICROSCOPY) METHOD FOR KILOHERTZ VOLUMETRIC IMAGING OF NEURONAL ACTION POTENTIALS IN AWAKE BEHAVING MICE. THE PROPOSED METHOD HAS BEEN ONLY RECENTLY MADE POSSIBLE BY AN EMERGING TECHNIQUE, LIGHT FIELD TOMOGRAPHY (LIFT), WHICH IS HIGHLY EFFICIENT IN ACQUIRING LIGHT FIELD DATA FOR 3D IMAGING. RATHER THAN MEASURING THE ENTIRE LIGHT FIELD DATACUBE, LIFT CAPTURES ONLY AN EN-FACE PROJECTION OF THE OBJECT IN EACH PERSPECTIVE IMAGE, THEREBY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE DATA LOAD. FURTHERMORE, LIFT RECORDS DATA USING ONE-DIMENSIONAL (1D) SENSORS, EXPLOITING THE FACT THAT MOST FAST CAMERAS ARE IN 1D FORMAT. IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, WE WILL ADAPT LIFT FOR 3D FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE USE OF GEVI, THE RESULTANT SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE A COMPLETE SOLUTION TO HIGH-SPEED VOLTAGE IMAGING OF 3D NEURONAL NETWORKS.

AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE WHICH DOSE (300 OR 900 MG/D) OF CBD PRODUCES A GREATER EFFECT ON ANANDAMIDE AND ANXIETY REACTIVITY. IF CBD IS FOUND TO BE SUPERIOR TO PLACEBO IN ELEVATING PLASMA ANANDAMIDE LEVELS AND REDUCING ANXIETY REACTIVITY, THE R33 PHASE PROJECT WILL ATTEMPT TO REPLICATE THE R61 PROJECT FINDINGS (AIM 1; SUB-ACUTE DOSING STUDY) AND EXAMINE WHETHER CHANGES IN ANANDAMIDE AND ANXIETY RESPONSES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT (I.E., REDUCTION IN ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND IMPAIRMENT; AIM 2) FOLLOWING AN 8-WEEK DOUBLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL OF CBD (DOSE INFORMED BY THE R61 PROJECT) IN SUBJECTS DIAGNOSED WITH SAD. SECONDARY CLINICAL OUTCOMES WILL BE CHANGE IN FUNCTIONAL INTERFERENCE, AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND GENERAL ANXIETY. POSITIVE FINDINGS WILL SUPPORT A LARGER CONFIRMATORY EFFICACY TRIAL TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF CBD FOR ANXIETY DISORDERS. REGARDLESS OF STUDY OUTCOMES, IMPORTANT INFORMATION WILL BE GAINED ABOUT THE ROLE OF CBD IN MODULATING ENDOCANNABINOID-MEDIATED ANXIETY OUTCOMES, WHICH WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON CANNABINOIDS AND ANXIETY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ce42d274-7283-659b-de1c-e11666794c48-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R61AT011735_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151589311, "Award ID": "R61AT011519", "Award Amount": 983932.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-01", "CFDA Number": "93.213", "Description": "EFFECTS OF MUSIC TRAINING ON NEURODEVELOPMENT AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH OUTCOMES - PROJECT SUMMARY  WHILE THERE IS A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT MUSIC TRAINING BENEFITS BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, THE EVIDENCE IS NOT CONCLUSIVE AND RIGOROUSLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT) NEUROIMAGING STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER TO WHETHER AND WHICH BRAIN CIRCUITS ARE ENHANCED BY MUSIC TRAINING AND HOW.

WELL-KNOWN FOR SHAPING THE PERCEPTION OF SOCIAL STIMULI AND RECOGNIZED FOR ITS ACTIONS AT THE OXYTOCIN RECEPTOR (OXTR) WITHIN THE BRAIN, WHERE IT ORCHESTRATES EMOTIONAL AND HOMEOSTATIC RESPONSES TO SOCIAL STIMULI. AS A RESULT, OXYTOCIN IS CONSIDERED A MEDIATOR OF EXTEROCEPTION AND IS IN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES RANGING FROM AUTISM TO OBESITY. WHILE LESS-STUDIED, OXTR(S) ARE ALSO EXPRESSED IN THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND WE PROPOSE THAT INVESTIGATION OF THESE OXTR(S) IS CRITICAL TO UNRAVELING THE INTRICACIES OF INTEROCEPTION. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES IN MICE REVEALED THAT WITHIN THE NODOSE GANGLIA (NDG), OXTR(S) DEMARCATE SPECIFIC NEURONS INNERVATING THE AORTIC ARCH, STOMACH AND DUODENUM. FASCINATINGLY, EXCITATION OF OXTR-EXPRESSING NEURONS IN THE NDG (REFERRED TO AS NDGOXTR) ELICITS A ROBUST CARDIOMETABOLIC RESPONSE TYPIFIED BY LOWERED BLOOD PRESSURE AND FOOD INTAKE. OUR INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS IS THAT NDGOXTR CAN BE STUDIED TO UNDERSTAND HOW SIGNALS FROM THE VASCULATURE OR GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) TRACT ARE RELAYED TO THE BRAIN AND COULD LEAD TO NOVEL INSIGHTS FOR DEVELOPING MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS TO ALLEVIATE DISEASES THAT IMPACT MULTIPLE ORGANS IN THE CARDIOMETABOLIC AXIS. IN HUMAN FMRI STUDIES, PERTURBATIONS IN BLOOD PRESSURE OR GI DISTENSION CHANGE THE ACTIVITY OF THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC), AND INTRIGUINGLY, WE FOUND THAT EXCITATION OF NDGOXTR ALSO ALTERS THE ACTIVITY OF A SUBSET OF PFC NEURONS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NDGOXTR INFLUENCE CORTICAL NEURONS ENCODING INTEROCEPTION OF THE VASCULATURE OR GI TRACT TO ORIENT BEHAVIOR TOWARD RESTORING HOMEOSTASIS. FINALLY, THE PRESENCE OF THE OXTR WITHIN THE NDG, IN CONJUNCTION WITH REPORTS THAT OXYTOCIN DEPOLARIZES NDG NEURONS, SUGGESTS THAT OXTR(S) PROMOTE EXCITATION OF VAGAL AFFERENTS TO INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY BY WHICH THE VASCULATURE OR GI TRACT ARE PERCEIVED. THESE OBSERVATIONS HAVE LED TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT DISTINCT NDGOXTR SHAPE INTEROCEPTION THROUGH SEPARATE NEURAL CIRCUITS THAT RELAY SIGNALS FROM THE VASCULATURE OR GI TRACT TO THE PFC. WE FURTHER HYPOTHESIZE THAT OXYTOCIN ENHANCES THIS INTEROCEPTION BY INCREASING THE SENSITIVITY OF VAGAL AFFERENTS TO CARDIOMETABOLIC ALTERATIONS. WE WILL PURSUE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1 USES NEUROANATOMICAL TRACING, INTRAVITAL IMAGING OF NDG AND IN VIVO OPTOGENETICS WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL RECORDINGS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SEPARATE POPULATIONS OF NDGOXTR RESPOND TO STIMULATION OF THE VASCULATURE OR GI TRACT TO ELICIT DISTINCT COMPENSATORY RESPONSES. AIM 2 USES INTRAVITAL IMAGING OF THE PFC AND IN VIVO OPTOGENETICS WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL RECORDINGS TO EVALUATE WHETHER NDGOXTR INNERVATING THE VASCULATURE OR GI TRACT AFFECT THE EXCITATION-INHIBITION BALANCE OF PFC NEURONS TO ORIENT BEHAVIOR TOWARD RECTIFICATION OF HOMEOSTATIC NEED. AIM 3 USES TISSUE SPECIFIC GENE DELETION, INTRAVITAL IMAGING AND PHARMACOLOGY TO INVESTIGATE HOW OXTR(S) EXPRESSED BY THE NDG AFFECT INDICES OF CARDIOMETABOLIC INTEROCEPTION.

MOREOVER, CBGA ITSELF IS BIOACTIVE AND SHOWS PROMISE FOR TREATMENT OF GLAUCOMA, INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, AND HUNTINGTON\u2019S DISEASE AMONG OTHER INDICATIONS. A KEY BARRIER TO CELL-BASED AND CELL-FREE PRODUCTION OF CNS HAS BEEN TWOFOLD. FIRST, RELIANCE ON THE NATIVE MEMBRANE PROTEIN TO MAKE CBGA, GERANYL:OLIVETOLATE TRANSFERASE (GOT). SECOND, BIOSYNTHESIS OF CBGA REQUIRES SYNTHESIS OF TWO COMPLEX AND ESSENTIAL INTERMEDIATES, OLIVETOLIC ACID (OA) AND GERANYL PYROPHOSPHATE (GPP). IN A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT, WE WERE ABLE TO DESIGN A HIGHLY ACTIVE, SPECIFIC AND WATER SOLUBLE GOT ENZYME. WITH THIS SOLUBLE GOT ENZYME, WE DESIGNED A 7 ENZYME SYSTEM FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CBGA FROM LOW COST INPUTS, THAT WE CALL SIMPLEPATH. INITIAL PHASE I RESULTS YIELDED CBGA TITERS WELL OVER 12 G/L, EXCEEDING CELL-BASED METHODS BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE AND SUGGESTING SIMPLEPATH IS SUITABLE FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. OUR GOAL IN THIS PHASE II APPLICATION IS TO EXPAND OUR SIMPLEPATH APPROACH AND MAKE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS TO LOWER COSTS, IMPROVE TITERS, AND BROADEN THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED. AT THE END OF PHASE II WE WILL PERFORM TECHNO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS ON THE OPTIMIZED SIMPLEPATH SYSTEM TO GUIDE COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS (AND IDENTIFY OTHER WEAK POINTS) THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IN A PHASE III OR PILOT SCALE PROJECT. PHASE II WORK IS NECESSARY FOR ESTABLISHING A CONSISTENT, HIGHLY PURE SUPPLY OF A RANGE OF CNS TO BE USED AS THERAPEUTICS OR NUTRACEUTICALS AT COSTS THAT CAN COMPETE WITH OR SURPASS BOTH MICROBIAL AND PLANT DERIVED CN PRODUCTION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ce5ab78d-d500-20a6-cb20-0862d7e9ebe2-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44AT011482_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110463972, "Award ID": "R44AT011380", "Award Amount": 1499683.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-18", "CFDA Number": "93.213", "Description": "WEARABLE TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL ACUSTIMULATION FOR GASTROPARESIS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OK", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2612b8c2-d1d3-a415-eaa8-e456a4d10504-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44AT011380_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151589951, "Award ID": "R44AT010840", "Award Amount": 1772804.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-19", "CFDA Number": "93.213", "Description": "OPTICAL REDOX PROBE FOR CONTINUOUS METABOLIC MONITORING DURING NATURAL PRODUCTS BIOPROCESSING - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  ALMOST HALF OF THE MEDICINES ON THE MARKET ARE NATURAL PRODUCTS INCLUDING POLYKETIDES, FATTY ACIDS, AMINO ACIDS, TERPENOIDS AND STEROIDS. THOUGH MANY OF THE NATURAL PRODUCTS ARE DISCOVERED IN PLANTS, MASS PRODUCTION OF THESE MOLECULES RELIES ON CULTURING MICROORGANISMS IN BIOREACTORS. HOWEVER, IT IS OFTEN A CHALLENGE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN HIGH BIOMANUFACTURING PRODUCTIVITY AND YIELD TO ENABLE LOW-COST AND HIGH- QUALITY PRODUCTION AT LARGE SCALES. ONE UNMET NEED IS AN ABILITY TO RAPIDLY AND ACCURATELY MEASURE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS OF MICROBES AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL WITHIN BIOREACTORS. MEASURING THE CELLULAR METABOLIC STATE, ESPECIALLY ENERGETIC AND REDOX PARAMETERS, IS KEY TO DEVELOPING IMPROVED BIOSYNTHESIS PROCESSES AND TO GUIDING FEEDING STRATEGIES AND OTHER OPERATIONAL ACTIONS. DUE TO THE COMPLEX NATURE OF BIOREACTOR CELL CULTURE SYSTEMS, CURRENTLY THE CAPABILITY OF MEASURING CELLULAR METABOLIC PARAMETERS IN REAL TIME IS UNAVAILABLE, AND METABOLIC ASSESSMENT RELIES ON TIME-CONSUMING, PERIODIC REMOVAL OF CULTURE SAMPLES FOR OFF-LINE ANALYSIS.  DURING THIS R&D PROGRAM, PHYSICAL SCIENCES INC. (PSI), IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL (UML) AND NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY (NEU), WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL TWO-PHOTON EXCITATION (TPE) FLUORESCENCE REDOX SENSOR FOR ON-LINE, REAL-TIME MEASUREMENT OF CELL METABOLISM IN BIOREACTORS FOR NATURAL PRODUCTS FERMENTATION. A MINIATURIZED OPTICAL PROBE WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT CAN BE STERILIZED AND INSERTED INTO BIOREACTOR CULTURES FOR CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENT OF DYNAMIC CHANGES OF IMPORTANT INTRACELLULAR METABOLITES. THE TECHNOLOGY IS EQUIVALENT TO AN ONLINE CYTOMETER WITHIN THE BIOREACTOR, PROVIDING CRITICAL CELLULAR-LEVEL PHYSIOLOGY DATA THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ONLY AVAILABLE FROM OFF-LINE MEASUREMENTS. THE INTRACELLULAR REDOX RATIO WILL BE MONITORED USING THE AUTOFLUORESCENCE OF ENDOGENOUS FLUOROPHORES, WITHOUT THE NEED (BUT NOT EXCLUDING THE OPTION) FOR EXOGENOUS FLUORESCENCE LABELING.  DURING THE PHASE I PROGRAM, THE PSI LED TEAM SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY. A GEN-I PROTOTYPE REDOX SENSOR WAS FABRICATED AND TESTED DURING CONTINUOUS METABOLISM MEASUREMENTS IN OPERATIONAL BIOREACTORS, MITIGATING THE CRITICAL TECHNICAL RISKS OF THE PROPOSED PHASE II RESEARCH. DURING THE PHASE II PROGRAM, THE RESEARCH EFFORT WILL BE FOCUSED ON OPTIMIZING THE TECHNOLOGY, DEMONSTRATING ITS VALUE IN ADVANCING BIOMANUFACTURING PROCESS DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONS, AND PREPARING FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. IN PARTICULAR, A GEN-II PROTOTYPE WITH SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO AND SYSTEM ROBUSTNESS WILL BE FABRICATED. THE GEN-II INSTRUMENT WILL THEN BE TESTED IN A LARGE-NUMBER OF BIOREACTOR OPERATIONS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE NEW REAL-TIME CELLULAR METABOLISM DATA WILL BE UTILIZED TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF NOVEL AND MORE EFFECTIVE BIOREACTOR PROCESSES FOR IMPROVED PRODUCT YIELD.

HOWEVER, LIMITED ACCESS TO IN-CLINIC TREATMENT, DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF SPECIALIZED PAIN TREATMENT CENTERS AND DISRUPTION TO SCHOOL/FAMILY LIFE, PREVENTS THE MAJORITY OF THESE CHILDREN FROM ACHIEVING EFFICIENT REINTEGRATION INTO NORMAL FAMILY/SCHOOL ACTIVITIES. THERE IS A NEED FOR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS OFFERING REMOTE ACCESS TO MBIS, SUCH AS YOGA THERAPY, THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY ENGAGING FOR CHILDREN TO OVERCOME THEIR TYPICAL POOR ADHERENCE TO HOME PROGRAMS.

GAD IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ANXIETY DISORDERS AND IS COSTLY TO TREAT, WITH MEDICAL COSTS THAT ARE 33% HIGHER THAN OTHER ANXIETY DISORDERS. RECENT WEEKLY GAD-2 SURVEYS BY THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU HAVE INDICATED THAT THE PREVALENCE OF GAD MAY BE SHARPLY INCREASING AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. AS OF JULY 2020, 36% OF AMERICAN ADULTS HAVE SYMPTOMS OF GAD VS. 8% BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. TAKEN TOGETHER, THERE IS A NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE THERAPY TO EFFECTIVELY TREAT GAD. FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS FOR GAD INCLUDE MEDICATION (E.G. SSRIS, SNRIS), COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY, OR BOTH IN COMBINATION. UNFORTUNATELY, THESE ALL HAVE SHOWN MODEST LONG-TERM REMISSION RATES OF ONLY 20-50%. MEDICATIONS ALSO HAVE COMMON, UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECTS THAT LIMIT ACCEPTABILITY TO PATIENTS. BENZODIAZEPINES (BZS) ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICATION FOR TREATING GAD. HOWEVER, GUIDELINES RECOMMEND ONLY PRESCRIBING BZS FOR SHORT-TERM USE DUE TO THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP TOLERANCE AND DEPENDENCE. NEUROMODULATION INVESTIGATIONS VIA REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (RTMS) HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN GREAT PROMISE FOR TREATING GAD, WITH RESPONDER RATES OF 64- 100% IN SHORT-TERM STUDIES. HOWEVER, RTMS IS EXPENSIVE ($6,000-$12,000 FOR A 20-30 TREATMENT COURSE) AND REQUIRES DAILY VISITS TO THE CLINIC, LIMITING THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD ADOPTION. RECENT PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT ACUPUNCTURE-BASED NERVE STIMULATION CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING ANXIETY, BUT IT HAS THE KEY LIMITATION THAT TREATMENT MUST BE ADMINISTERED BY AN ACUPUNCTURIST IN THE CLINIC OR AT HOME. TO BUILD ON THIS WORK AND ADDRESS THE NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE THERAPY FOR GAD, THERANOVA HAS DEVELOPED THE EMPOWER NEUROMODULATION SYSTEM, A PORTABLE, NON-INVASIVE TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION (TENS), OR TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTROACUPUNCTURE, DEVICE FOR NON-INVASIVE STIMULATION OF PERIPHERAL NERVES.

INTERNATIONAL LLC, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MAYO CLINIC, PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A HIGHLY INNOVATIVE NEXT-GENERATION CLINICAL INSTRUMENT TOGETHER WITH CUSTOM USER-FRIENDLY DISPLAY AND ANALYSIS SOFTWARE. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL APPARATUS FOR VOLTAMMETRY, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, AND NEUROMODULATION (MAVEN) WILL OFFER WIRELESS VOLTAMMETRIC SENSING OF MULTIPLE NEUROTRANSMITTERS (E.G., DOPAMINE, SEROTONIN, AND ADENOSINE) AT CARBON-FIBER MICROELECTRODES. MAVEN CAN BE APPLIED TO A BROAD RANGE OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH SUBJECTS INVOLVING BRAIN NEUROSURGERIES. ALONGSIDE THESE MULTIPLE NEUROCHEMICAL SENSING CAPABILITIES, THE DEVICE WILL BE CAPABLE OF NEAR-SIMULTANEOUS ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL (E.G., ACTION AND LOCAL FIELD POTENTIALS) RECORDINGS. THE MAIN INNOVATION OF THE MAVEN SYSTEM IS TO INCLUDE STATE-OF-THE-ART VOLTAMMETRIC TECHNIQUES TO QUANTITATIVELY MEASURE BOTH PHASIC (STIMULATION-INDUCED) AND TONIC (RESTING) CONCENTRATION LEVELS OF NEUROCHEMICALS IN REAL-TIME AND NEAR-SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH OTHER RECORDING MODALITIES. THIS CAPABILITY IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, MULTIPLE CYCLIC SQUARE WAVE VOLTAMMETRY (MCSWV) WILL ENABLE SECOND-TO-SECOND QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF TONIC EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND SEROTONIN WITH EXCEPTIONAL SPATIAL RESOLUTION, SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AND MINIMAL TISSUE DISTURBANCE. THIS PROPOSAL EMPLOYS OUR UNIQUE COMBINED EXPERTISE IN NEUROSCIENCE, ELECTROCHEMISTRY, ENGINEERING, AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO VALIDATE THIS NOVEL CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTRUMENT IN PREPARATION FOR ITS USE DURING INTRAOPERATIVE CLINICAL NEUROSURGERIES. ALSO, COMBINING ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY AND ELECTROCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGIES WOULD ENABLE INVESTIGATORS TO PROBE UNEXPLORED LINKS BETWEEN THE ABNORMAL ACTIVITY OF NEURAL ELEMENTS AND THE DOPAMINERGIC, SEROTONERGIC, PURINERGIC (ADENOSINE) DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROPSYCHOPATHOLOGIES, SUCH AS PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE, ESSENTIAL TREMOR, OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER, DEPRESSION, AND EPILEPSY. OUR LARGE ANIMAL MODEL (SWINE) STUDIES EMULATING EXISTING HUMAN INTRAOPERATIVE NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION TO GUIDE AND INFORM THE FINALIZATION OF THE MAVEN DESIGN FOR USE BY THE CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE COMMUNITY IN FUTURE IDE-ENABLED MECHANISTIC CLINICAL STUDIES. OUR PROPOSAL SEEKS TO (1) FINALIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAVEN, TOGETHER WITH A SOPHISTICATED USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE INTERFACE THAT (2) MEETS DEVICE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, REGULATORY DESIGN CONTROL, AND MEDICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN AN FDA-APPROVED INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE), AND (3) USE A SWINE MODEL TO DEVELOP MAVEN STIMULATION AND RECORDING PROTOCOLS FOR USE IN EXISTING INTRAOPERATIVE NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES (E.G., DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION NEUROSURGERIES AND CORTICAL LOBECTOMIES).

TO MAXIMIZE EFFICACY, HYPNOSCIENTIFIC\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE INFORMED BY THE FINDINGS FROM A WELL- ESTABLISHED AND ONGOING RESEARCH PROGRAM STUDYING THE MECHANISMS OF HYPNOTIC ANALGESIA, INCLUDING PILOT RESEARCH THAT HAS TESTED A HYPNOSIS DIGITAL THERAPEUTIC PROTOTYPE. THE FIRST AIM OF THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED PHASE I PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP THE HYPNOSIS DIGITAL THERAPEUTIC PROTOTYPE FURTHER BY: (1) UPDATING AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HYPNOSIS MEDIA TRACKS OFFERED, (2) DESIGNING A RULESET FOR CONTENT DELIVERY, (3) DEVELOPING UI/UX STANDARDS TO OPTIMIZE EASE OF USE AND EFFICACY, AND (4) DEVELOPING A CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONSISTENT WITH THIS RULESET, THAT WOULD ALLOW CONTENT TO BE PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC PAIN VIA AN EXISTING TELEHEALTH COMPANY\u2019S PLATFORM. THE PROJECT\u2019S SECOND AIM IS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY DELIVERY SYSTEM DEVELOPED IN AIM 1 IN A SAMPLE OF 50 INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC PAIN. THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO HAVING MORE ACCESS (I.E., 8 FULL WEEKS) OR LESS ACCESS (I.E., 4 WEEKS OF NO ACCESS FOLLOWED BY 4 WEEKS OF ACCESS) TO THE THERAPEUTIC, AND FEASIBILITY VARIABLES WILL BE COLLECTED DURING AND AFTER THE TRIAL. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS TRIAL WILL ALLOW US TO DETERMINE IF THE PROPOSED APPROACH FOR MAKING HYPNOSIS TREATMENT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM IT IS VIABLE.

HOWEVER, DUE TO TECHNICAL CONSTRAINS THE CURRENTLY USED HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING TECHNIQUES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH COMPLEX NATURAL SAMPLES. ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEW DRUG LEADS FROM NATURAL PRODUCTS IS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE EXTRACTS, THAT REQUIRES ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO DISCOVER BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE SECONDARY METABOLITES. TRADITIONAL SCREENING METHODS OFTEN REQUIRE ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS FROM MIXTURES THROUGH CHEMICAL SEPARATION, FOLLOWED BY DEREPLICTION AND ASSAY ANALYSIS, WHICH ARE TIME CONSUMING, LABOR INTENSIVE, AND COSTLY. HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING TECHNIQUES MAINLY FOCUS ON SYNTHETIC LIBRARIES OF INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS AND ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MIXTURES. IN CONTRAST, PROTEIN TARGET IMMOBILIZATION TECHNIQUES CAN DIRECTLY FISH OUT BINDING COMPOUNDS ELIMINATING THE NEED TO ISOLATE INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THE PROTEIN IMMOBILIZATION METHODOLOGIES SUFFER FROM SIGNIFICANT NON-SPECIFIC BINDING OF COMPOUNDS TO SUPPORT SURFACES, WHICH MAKES THEM NOT SUITABLE FOR SCREENING COMPLEX MIXTURES. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF THE IMMOBILIZED TARGET PROTEINS ON SOLID SURFACES ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED TO CYTOSOLIC PROTEINS, SUCH AS ENZYMES OR ANTIBODIES. THIS IS A GREAT LIMITATION, BECAUSE OVER 50% OF ALL MODERN PHARMACEUTICALS USE MEMBRANE PROTEINS AS PRIME TARGETS. CELLULAR MEMBRANE AFFINITY CHROMATOGRAPHY (CMAC) IS AN APPROACH THAT ALLOWS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF COMPOUNDS, PRESENT IN COMPLEX MATRICES AND SPECIFICALLY INTERACTING WITH THE IMMOBILIZED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN. CMAC COLUMNS HAVE PROVEN TO BE USEFUL IN SCREENING PLANT EXTRACTS AND SMOKE CONDENSATES FOR NEW LIGANDS TARGETING DIFFERENT CLASSES OF TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEINS. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT PREVENTS CMAC FROM WIDER USE IS THE RELATIVELY COMPLEX PREPARATION PROTOCOL OF CMAC COLUMNS AND THE LACK OF EASY-TO- USE CATCH AND RELEASE CHROMATOGRAPHIC KITS. WE PROPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL AND PATENTABLE CMAC KIT WITH AN OPTIMIZED PREPARATION PROTOCOL OF CMAC COLUMNS. USING THIS NOVEL APPROACH HOMOGENIZED CELL MEMBRANE FRAGMENTS WITH THE TARGETED PROTEINS WILL BE IMMOBILIZED ON IAM.PC.DD2 COLUMNS, PRODUCED SOLELY BY REGIS TECHNOLOGIES. THE IMMOBILIZATION STEP USING PRE-PACKED COLUMNS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR SOLUBILIZATION AND DIALYSIS STEPS USED IN THE CURRENT PROTOCOL. THE NEWLY DEVELOPED CMAC KIT WILL SPEED UP THE IDENTIFICATION OF PHYTOCHEMICALS TARGETING TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEINS. THIS NOVEL ASSAY WILL BE IDEALLY SUITED TO BUILD LIBRARIES OF PHARMACOLOGICALLY ACTIVE NATURAL COMPOUNDS THAT FURTHER MIGHT BE TESTED USING MODERN SCREENING PLATFORMS. CMAC IS ALSO A TOOL THAT CAN REPLACE FUNCTIONAL CELL-BASED ASSAYS IN DETERMINING CERTAIN PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF DRUG CANDIDATES, FOR EXAMPLE: KD (THE CONCENTRATION OF DRUG THAT BINDS 50% OF THE RECEPTORS). THE CMAC KIT CAN EASILY BE APPLIED IN DRUG DISCOVERY LABORATORIES TO IDENTIFY NOVEL DRUG TEMPLATES THAT CAN BE FURTHER USED TO TREAT CERTAIN FORMS OF CANCER, NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, CHRONIC PAIN, DIABETES AND MANY OTHER ILLNESSES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1e11f4d1-a3f8-5ea8-9a5a-fb1ecf4a0c92-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R41AT011716_7529"}, {"internal_id": 130087881, "Award ID": "R41AT011494", "Award Amount": 256129.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-04-01", "CFDA Number": "93.213", "Description": "DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE MEDICAL DEVICE TECHNOLOGY FOR QUANTIFYING FORCES DURING SOFT TISSUE MANIPULATION ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION - PROJECT SUMMARY THE LACK OF A MEANS TO QUANTIFY SOFT TISSUE MANIPULATION (STM) MOTION AND DOSE AS DELIVERED IN THE CLINIC IS A CRITICAL PROBLEM IN THE REPRODUCIBILITY AND THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF THIS NON-INVASIVE AND NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MODALITY. STM IS A FORM OF MANUAL THERAPY USED TO EVALUATE AND TREAT MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, INFLAMMATION, AND DYSFUNCTION. DIFFERENT SOFT TISSUE FORCES HAVE DIFFERING BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS AND OUTCOMES. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS STM MAY SERVE AS A SURROGATE OR AUGMENT TO EXERCISE, WHICH HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS IN REHABILITATION. LIKE EXERCISE, OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS ARE NEEDED FOR OPTIMAL STM DOSING. HOWEVER, INITIAL RESEARCH INDICATES A HIGH LEVEL OF INCONSISTENCY IN STM FORCE APPLICATION, BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN THERAPISTS, WHILE QUANTITATIVE FEEDBACK SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES ITS ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY. UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT STM PRACTICE RELIES MOSTLY ON SUBJECTIVE TREATMENT VARIABLES AND VAGUE DESCRIPTORS OF SOFT TISSUE QUALITY AND PAIN. UNWARRANTED VARIATION IN ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT CAN COMPROMISE OUTCOMES AND DIMINISH THE VALUE OF THE PRACTICE. THERE IS A STRONG NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN GENERATE STM METRICS TO IMPROVE PRACTICE BY PROVIDING A COMMON LANGUAGE TO OPTIMIZE STM EXAMINATION AND INTERVENTION, ENABLE DOSE PRESCRIPTIONS, FACILITATE TRAINING, STUDY ITS EFFECTS, AND EVALUATE OUTCOMES.  OUR TEAM HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL MEDICAL DEVICE SYSTEM, QUANTIFIABLE SOFT TISSUE MANIPULATION (QSTM\u2122) AS A SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THIS VOID IN MANUAL THERAPY. QSTM\u2122 INCLUDES A DEVICE (Q1) FOR THE APPLICATION AND SENSING OF LOCALIZED FORCES IN SMALLER REGIONS (E.G., FINGER OR ELBOW) AND ANOTHER DEVICE (Q2) FOR DISPERSIVE FORCES IN LARGER REGIONS (E.G., BACK OR THIGH), ALONG WITH CUSTOM SOFTWARE FOR RECORDING AND ANALYSIS OF TREATMENT DATA, INCLUDING STM FORCE MAGNITUDE, ANGLE, RATE, AND DIRECTION. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF QSTM\u2122 FOR CLINICAL USE. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT QSTM\u2122 WILL IMPROVE THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF STM EXAMINATION AND INTERVENTION. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AIM TO OPTIMIZE THE DESIGN OF THE DEVICE SYSTEM; QUANTITATIVELY CHARACTERIZE BASIC STM STROKE MOTION PATTERNS; TEST THE RELIABILITY OF STM FORCE APPLICATION USING QSTM\u2122 DATA OUTPUT; AND DETERMINE ITS USABILITY FOR PAIN ASSESSMENT. A LARGE MARKET EXISTS FOR USE OF QSTM\u2122 IN MULTIPLE HEALTH DISCIPLINES, SPORTS, EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND VETERINARY MEDICINE. PEOPLE AND PAYERS SEEKING PRECISE, PATIENT-CENTRIC CARE WILL EVENTUALLY DRIVE THE MARKET. QSTM\u2122 REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER ITS COMPETITION OF TRADITIONAL MANUAL METHODS, WITH OR WITHOUT RIGID INSTRUMENTS, OR MIMETIC DEVICES. QSTM\u2122 OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE OR COMPLEMENT TO OTHER APPROACHES. WE HAVE CONSULTED WITH EXPERTS ON OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND MARKETING AND SALES STRATEGIES. THIS PROJECT ALIGNS WITH THE NATIONAL CENTER OF COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRIORITIES. NIH SUPPORT WILL ACCELERATE COMMERCIALIZATION. QSTM\u2122 IS TO MANUAL THERAPY WHAT THE FITBIT IS TO EXERCISE. QSTM\u2122 BETTER ENABLES INDIVIDUALIZED REHABILITATION THROUGH OBJECTIVE MEASURES AND GOAL SETTING, RECORDING, MONITORING, AND REPRODUCIBILITY.

A PROMISING VERTEBRATE MODEL SYSTEM IN THIS REGARD IS THE ZEBRAFISH LARVA, WHICH PERFORMS COMPLEX VISUALLY-DRIVEN BEHAVIORS SUCH AS HUNTING FROM AN EARLY AGE, AND DUE TO ITS TRANSPARENCY ALLOWS LARGE-SCALE NEURAL IMAGING AT SINGLE- NEURON RESOLUTION.

ACCESSIBLE TREATMENTS THAT ADDRESS PTSD AND CHRONIC PAIN ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. TAI CHI IS AN ANCIENT CHINESE EXERCISE THAT USES AN INTEGRATED MIND-BODY APPROACH TO ENHANCE QUALITY OF LIFE. TAI CHI DELIVERED IN GROUPS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN PATIENTS WITH A VARIETY OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES TO DATE HAVE EXAMINED TAI CHI FOR PTSD AND PAIN IN VETERANS. SINCE THE ONSET OF COVID-19, INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE DELIVERED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR FACE-TO-FACE CONTACT ARE GREATLY NEEDED. REMOTE MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED VIA VIDEOCONFERENCING PLATFORMS CAN REDUCE BARRIERS TO TREATMENT FOR VETERANS ISOLATED BY PTSD-RELATED AVOIDANCE, TRAVEL RELATED CHALLENGES, OR PUBLIC HEALTH SOCIAL DISTANCING RESTRICTIONS. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF REMOTELY DELIVERED TAI CHI FOR PTSD AND PAIN IN VETERANS. THIS TRIAL REPRESENTS FIRST STEPS TOWARD A LONG-TERM GOAL OF ESTABLISHING THIS MIND-BODY TREATMENT TO ADDRESS THESE MALADIES FOR VETERANS VIA A REMOTE VIDEOCONFERENCING PLATFORM.

CHRONIC PAIN AFTER SCI CONTRIBUTES TO ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND DIMINISHES THE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). PHARMACOLOGICAL AGENTS SUCH AS OPIOIDS ARE THE PRIMARY THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS TO MANAGE CHRONIC PAIN AFTER SCI, BUT ARE INEFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING PAIN AND ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS. MINDFULNESS MEDITATION TRAINING (MM) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING PAIN-RELATED INTERFERENCE, IN MANY STUDIES OF PEOPLE WITHOUT SCI WHO HAVE CHRONIC PAIN. HOWEVER, THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE TYPICALLY LENGTHY, EXPENSIVE, AND REQUIRE IN-PERSON VISITS WITH A THERAPIST, MAKING THEM INACCESSIBLE TO MANY PEOPLE WITH SCI. MOUNTING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MOBILE APPS MAY PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE AND LOW-COST WAY TO PROVIDE MM. INDEED, ONE RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT INTERNET-BASED MM TRAINING LED TO REDUCED PAIN INTERFERENCE AND IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH IN PEOPLE WITH SCI AND CHRONIC PAIN, SUGGESTING APP-BASED MM INTERVENTIONS MAY HAVE PROMISE IN THIS POPULATION. HOWEVER, THIS STUDY USED AN INTERVENTION CREATED BY THE RESEARCHERS WHICH IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC FOR FREE, LIMITING LARGE-SCALE DISSEMINATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE FEASIBILITY FOUND IN THAT STUDY MAY NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE TO THAT OF AN EXISTING, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE APP-BASED MM INTERVENTION AMONG PERSONS WITH SCI. SIMILARLY, THE FEASIBILITY OF OTHER APP-BASED MM INTERVENTIONS FOR NON-SCI POPULATIONS MAY NOT TRANSLATE TO PERSONS WITH SCI DUE TO THE SPECIFIC PHYSIOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS EXPERIENCED BY PERSON WITH SCI.

THOUGH ONE OF THE TOP FIVE CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS IN TERMS OF PREVALENCE AND YEARS LOST TO DISABILITY, TO DATE, NECK PAIN HAS RECEIVED ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE RESEARCH FUNDING GIVEN TO LOW BACK PAIN. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS A LIMITED EVIDENCE BASE TO GUIDE MANAGEMENT. BOTH PHARMACOLOGICAL AND NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS ARE WIDELY USED TO MANAGE CNNP, BUT EFFECT SIZES ARE, AT BEST, LOW TO MODERATE, AND NO ONE THERAPY STANDS OUT AS SUPERIOR.  CNNP IS BEST UNDERSTOOD FROM A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FRAMEWORK THAT RECOGNIZES ETIOLOGY, SEVERITY, AND OUTCOMES AS A COMPLEX AND INTERRELATED ARRAY OF BIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS AND POINTS TO THE PROMISE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH APPROACHES FOR SUCCESSFUL DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT.

SPECIAL EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON PROVIDING COMPETENCY-BASED TRAINING TO PTS AND DCS IN THE SBSM INTERVENTION FOCUSED ON WHOLE PERSON CARE DELIVERY, INTEGRATING PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICALLY ORIENTED STRATEGIES SPECIFICALLY FOR CHRONIC BRLP.  AIM 2: TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITMENT AND ENROLLMENT (RECRUITMENT/ENROLLMENT RATES, PARTICIPANT VIEWS ON PARTICIPATION), DELIVERING EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPARISON INTERVENTIONS (ACCEPTABILITY AND ADHERENCE, PROVIDER FIDELITY, PARTICIPANT AND PROVIDER VIEWS), AND DATA COLLECTION (FOLLOW-UP RATES).  THIS RESEARCH ADDRESSES NCCIH HIGH PRIORITIES AREAS OF INTEGRATED MIND BODY APPROACHES FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC BRLP, A COSTLY, DISABLING, AND UNDERSTUDIED CONDITION. THE PILOT STUDY WILL ESTABLISH THE ESSENTIAL FOUNDATION FOR THE SUPPORT TRIAL, THE FIRST RCT COMPARING AN INNOVATIVE SBSM INTERVENTION TO MEDICAL CARE FOR BRLP.

THE INVOLVED TREATMENT REGI-MEN, INCLUDING DAILY INSULIN ADMINISTRATION/PUMP MANAGEMENT, FREQUENT BLOOD GLUCOSE CHECKS, AND CAREFUL TRACK-ING OF FOOD INTAKE, PLACES A HIGH-STRESS BURDEN ON PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ADOLESCENCE IS A PARTICULARLY RISKY TIME FOR T1D MANAGEMENT GIVEN A MARKED DECLINE IN TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL. OVER 80% OF ADOLESCENTS WITH T1D HAVE POOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL (A1C ?7.5%), AND ONE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR IS THE INCREASE IN NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY, INCLUDING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, THAT DISTINGUISH ADOLESCENTS WITH T1D. ELEVATED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AFFECT 40% OF TEENS WITH T1D. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY CONTRIBUTES TO DIMINISHED TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND WORSENING OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL, PARTIALLY THROUGH THE EFFECTS OF NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY ON STRESS-RELATED BEHAVIOR SUCH AS MALADAPTIVE EATING BEHAVIOR (E.G., DIETARY RESTRICTION, UNCONTROLLED EATING PATTERNS, AND INSULIN OMISSION FOR WEIGHT CONTROL). UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NO GOLD-STANDARD APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE POOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL SEEN IN ADOLESCENTS WITH T1D. THE CREATION OF NOV-EL, TARGETED INTERVENTIONS, TAILORED FOR THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF ADOLESCENTS WITH T1D AND THE PARTICULAR BUR-DENS OF COPING WITH THEIR CHRONIC ILLNESS, ARE NEEDED. MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED TO ADOLESCENTS WITHOUT T1D, INCLUDING OUR OWN PRELIMINARY WORK IN TEENS WITH DEPRESSION AND WEIGHT-RELATED DISORDERS, HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN TREATING NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY, MALADAPTIVE EATING BEHAVIOR, AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. A MINDFULNESS-BASED APPROACH MAY BE WELL-SUITED FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH T1D, BUT GIVEN THAT THE MECHANISMS OF ASSOCIATION AMONG NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY, STRESS-RELATED BEHAVIOR, AND SELF-CARE ARE UNIQUE TO INDIVIDUALS WITH T1D, INTERVEN-TIONS MUST BE SPECIFICALLY TAILORED FOR THIS POPULATION. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO, THEREFORE, ADAPT AN EXISTING 6-WEEK MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION, LEARNING TO BREATHE, FOR USE WITH ADOLESCENTS WITH T1D (BREATHE-T1D). THE FIRST SPECIFIC AIM OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO ADAPT BREATHE FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH T1D AND TO ADAPT A RELEVANT AND CREDIBLE 6-WEEK HEALTH EDUCATION COMPARISON CURRICULUM (HEALTHED-T1D). THE SECOND AIM IS TO CAR-RY OUT A 3-WAY PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF BREATHE-T1D, BREATHE-T1D DELIVERED VIA TELEHEALTH, AND HEALTHED-T1D DELIVERED VIA TELEHEALTH. GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHIC DIVER-SITY OF PATIENTS SEEN IN SPECIALTY CLINICS, FEASIBILITY/ACCEPTABILITY OF A TELEHEALTH DELIVERY MODALITY SHOULD BE TESTED. FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INTERVENTION AND AT 3 MONTHS POST INTERVENTION COMPLETION.

HERE WE WILL MODIFY AND EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH PARKINSON DISEASE (PD) AND FREEZING OF GAIT (FOG). FOG IS A SEVERE MOTOR DISTURBANCE THAT PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM STEPPING NORMALLY AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY, FRUSTRATION, SEDENTARY BEHAVIORS, POORER QUALITY OF LIFE, AND FALLS. MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE THAT CREATES A CULTURE TO REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY BY INCREASING CONSCIOUS AWARENESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE DEVELOPING A MINDFULNESS-BASED WALKING INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND MOBILITY CHALLENGES THAT CONSTITUTE FOG. THIS R34 INCLUDES THREE AIMS TO PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MIND AND BODY APPROACH FOR FOG AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH PD. IN AIM 1 WE WILL FORM AN ADVISORY GROUP OF STUDY TEAM MEMBERS, PHYSICAL THERAPISTS, MINDFULNESS INSTRUCTORS, AND PATIENT STAKEHOLDERS. THE ADVISORY GROUP WILL ADAPT THE CURRENT MBSR PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER A MINDFULNESS-BASED TREATMENT THAT EMPHASIZES WALKING MEDITATIONS AND IS SAFE AND APPLICABLE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH PD AND FOG.

WE WILL EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE STUDY DESIGN AND ASK PARTICIPANTS IF THE FOUND THE TREATMENT TO BE ACCEPTABLE. WE EXPECT THIS SMALLER STUDY WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR A LARGER TRIAL.  SUICIDE IS THE 10TH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. CHRONIC PAIN IS A LEADING CAUSE OF FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT IN THE UNITED STATES AND IS A RISK FACTOR OF SUICIDE EVEN AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. VETERANS ARE A VULNERABLE POPULATION FOR BOTH SUICIDE AND CHRONIC PAIN; HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE RESEARCH EXAMINING WAYS TO REDUCE FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT AND SUICIDE RISK IN A COMBINED TREATMENT. THEREFORE, THIS PROPOSAL EXAMINES THE USE OF MBCT AS A NOVEL WAY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT AND SUICIDE RISK. RESEARCH ON PATIENTS AT RISK OF SUICIDE AND ON PATIENTS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC PAIN SUPPORTS THE UTILITY OF MBCT SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE INVESTIGATING A COMBINED TREATMENT THAT ADDRESSES BOTH FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT AND SUICIDE RISK. APPLICATION OF MBCT ON VETERANS AT RISK FOR SUICIDE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FUNCTIONALLY-IMPAIRING CHRONIC PAIN PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS THESE INTERACTIVE FACTORS.

CURRENT GUIDELINES RECOMMEND USING NON-PHARMACOLOGIC APPROACHES FOR CLBP, WHICH INCLUDE YOGA, TAI CHI, MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR), AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT). WHILE THESE APPROACHES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL, ALL CURRENT APPROACHES HAVE IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS IN EFFICACY. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THESE INTERVENTIONS CAN BE STRENGTHENED TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR CLBP. IN RESPONSE TO THE FOA PAR-18-417 FOR HIGH-PRIORITY TOPICS, THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON MODIFYING MBSR TO DEVELOP AN OPTIMIZED PROGRAM FOR CLBP, MINDFULNESS-BASED PAIN REDUCTION (MBPR). BASED ON RECENT ADVANCES IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CENTRAL PROCESSING OF PAIN, WE PLAN MODIFICATIONS IN THREE CLOSELY RELATED AND POTENTIALLY SYNERGISTIC AREAS: (1) STRENGTHENING THE SKILL DEVELOPMENT OF INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC PAIN THROUGH FOCUSED ATTENTION IN THE SPECIFIC REGION OF PAIN; (2) EMPHASIZING MINDFUL MOVEMENT THAT IS OPTIMIZED BY USING CLBP-SPECIFIC YOGA MOVEMENTS; (3) SHIFTING SOME OF THE EMPHASIS IN DIDACTIC CONTENT TOWARD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CHRONIC PAIN AND ITS NEUROPHYSIOLOGY, INCORPORATING ELEMENTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR PAIN AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL PAIN EDUCATION. THE FORMAT WILL BE THE SAME AS MBSR: 8 WEEKS OF WEEKLY 2\u00bd- HOUR GROUP SESSIONS AND A DAYLONG RETREAT, BUT WITH A SMALLER GROUP SIZE: 10 PARTICIPANTS PER CLASS TO ALLOW FOR MORE INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT. KEY GOALS ARE TO REDUCE AVOIDANCE, RUMINATION, PAIN CATASTROPHIZING, AND FEAR OF MOVEMENT.  WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN INITIAL OUTLINE OF THE INTERVENTION. TO REFINE IT, WE WILL CONVENE AN INTERNATIONAL PANEL OF BEHAVIORAL AND YOGA THERAPISTS WITH EXPERTISE IN CHRONIC PAIN EDUCATION AND MANAGEMENT TO OBTAIN EXPERT ADVICE ON INTERVENTION OPTIMIZATION AND PRODUCE A FIRST DRAFT OF A MBPR MANUAL. WE WILL ENROLL 4 X 10 = 40 PATIENTS WITH CLBP INTO 4 CONSECUTIVE MBPR CLASSES TO ITERATIVELY REFINE THE MANUALIZED MBPR PROTOCOL THROUGH MIXED-METHODS EVALUATIONS AFTER EACH 8-WEEK ROUND OF MBPR. WE WILL ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE MBPR PROTOCOL BY QUESTIONNAIRES, MOBILE TECHNOLOGY TO ASSESS HOME USE OF MBPR PRACTICES, AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS. WE WILL ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF RANDOMIZATION BY RECRUITING 20 PARTICIPANTS AND RANDOMIZING THEM TO STANDARD MBSR (N \u02dc10) OR TO THE FOURTH MBPR CLASS (TOTAL N \u02dc10).

ONE MAJOR MECHANISM CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASED CV RISK IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION IS CHRONIC OVER-ACTIVATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (SNS). SNS OVERACTIVITY IN CKD LEADS TO DIFFICULT-TO-CONTROL BLOOD PRESSURE (BP), AND AN ABNORMAL CIRCADIAN RHYTHM OF BP CHARACTERIZED BY FAILURE TO DECREASE BP AT NIGHT (I.E. NONDIPPING), THAT IS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED CV RISK. CURRENT STRATEGIES TO COMBAT SNS OVERACTIVATION, HOWEVER, ARE LIMITED TO SYMPATHOLYTIC MEDICATIONS THAT ARE OFTEN POORLY TOLERATED WITH ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO DEVELOP NOVEL, SAFE, AND WELL-TOLERATED STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING SNS ACTIVITY TO IMPROVE CLINICAL CV OUTCOMES IN THIS HIGHLY PREVALENT AND GROWING POPULATION OF CKD PATIENTS. ONE SUCH NOVEL APPROACH AT IMPROVING HEMODYNAMICS AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTION IN CKD IS MINDFULNESS MEDITATION (MM). MULTIPLE PRIOR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MM, AND SPECIFICALLY MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR), SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES BP IN A VARIETY OF PATIENT POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE BP-LOWERING EFFECT OF MM ARE UNCLEAR. SMALL STUDIES USING INDIRECT MEASURES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT MM MAY MODULATE THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM; HOWEVER, NO PRIOR STUDIES HAVE USED DIRECT, GOLD-STANDARD METHODS TO INTERROGATE THE SUSTAINED EFFECTS OF MM-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON SNS. WE PERFORMED THE FIRST STUDIES USING DIRECT, INTRANEURAL MEASUREMENTS OF MUSCLE SYMPATHETIC NERVE ACTIVITY (MSNA) THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT MM ACUTELY REDUCES BP AND MSNA IN CKD. IN AIM1 (R61), WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT 8 WEEKS OF MBSR LEADS TO SUSTAINED REDUCTIONS IN MSNA THAT ARE LINKED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN DAYTIME BP, AND IMPROVED NOCTURNAL DIPPING OF BP IN CKD.

BOTH EXPERIMENTAL AND HUMAN STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT TVNS REDUCES SNS ACTIVITY, IMPROVES BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY (BRS), AND LOWERS INFLAMMATION, AND OUR PRELIMINARY DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT TVNS REDUCES MSNA AND IMPROVES BRS IN CKD. IN AIM 2 (R33), WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT TVNS AUGMENTS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF MBSR ON MSNA AND AMBULATORY BP PROFILES, AND AMELIORATES SNS OVERACTIVATION BY IMPROVING ARTERIAL BRS AND REDUCING INFLAMMATION IN CKD. THESE STUDIES WILL ELUCIDATE AUTONOMIC MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF MM IN CKD, WHILE ADDRESSING A CRITICAL NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAFE, WELL-TOLERATED AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT APPROACHES TO AMELIORATING SNS OVERACTIVITY, REDUCING BP AND IMPROVING CV RISK PROFILES IN PATIENT WITH CKD.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4d4ce585-e95e-2593-758c-86dc120820ad-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R33AT010457_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151948205, "Award ID": "R33AT010408", "Award Amount": 1083914.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-13", "CFDA Number": "93.213", "Description": "MICRORNA REGULATION OF NMNAT-MEDIATED NEUROPROTECTION AGAINST PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY AND CHRONIC PAIN - MICRORNA REGULATION OF NMNAT-MEDIATED NEUROPROTECTION AGAINST PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY AND  CHRONIC PAIN  PROJECT SUMMARY  PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY AND NEUROPATHY PAIN CAN BE CAUSED BY A MYRIAD OF GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENT FACTORS AS WELL AS THERAPEUTIC OR RECREATIONAL DRUG USE. IN PARTICULAR, CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (CIPN) IS THE MAJOR DOSE-LIMITING NEUROTOXIC SIDE EFFECT OF STANDARD CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMENTS.

CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AVAILABLE, LARGELY DUE TO A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE IN VIVO MECHANISMS OF CIPN AND RELATED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY. RECENTLY, WE HAVE OPTIMIZED A MODEL OF PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY USING DROSOPHILA LARVAE THAT RECAPITULATES SALIENT BEHAVIOR AND NEURONAL MORPHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY- INDUCED SENSORY DYSFUNCTION. OUR PRELIMINARY WORK USING THIS MODEL HAS UNCOVERED A NEW MECHANISM UNDERLYING PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, AND IDENTIFIED A NEUROPROTECTIVE PROTEIN NMNAT WITH PROMISING POTENTIAL FOR MITIGATING NEUROPATHIC PAIN.

EXCITINGLY, FROM A COMPOUND SCREEN, SEVERAL NATURAL COMPOUNDS WERE IDENTIFIED TO UPREGULATE NMNAT TRANSCRIPTION, AND WE HAVE COLLECTED INTRIGUING PRELIMINARY RESULTS SUGGESTING THAT THE EXPRESSION OF NMNAT IS REGULATED BY MICRORNAS.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND HOST RESPONSE LEADING TO IMBALANCE IN THE RATIO OF OXIDANTS TO ANTIOXIDANTS, AND PROTEASES TO ANTIPROTEASES LEADING TO CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND TISSUE DESTRUCTION IS THOUGHT TO PLAY CRUCIAL ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION OF COPD. QUERCETIN IS A PLANT FLAVONOID AND HAS POTENT ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES. QUERCETIN SUPPLEMENTATION DECREASED MARKERS OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND INFLAMMATION IN THE PLASMA OF PATIENTS WITH ANOTHER CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE, PULMONARY SARCOIDOSIS. QUERCETIN ALSO DECREASED BOTH OXIDATIVE STRESS AND LUNG INFLAMMATION IN A PRECLINICAL MODEL OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD).

UNFORTUNATELY, PHARMACOLOGICAL AND NON- PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS HAVE LIMITED BENEFITS FOR THESE IMPAIRMENTS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS REMAIN A CRITICAL UNMET THERAPEUTIC NEED, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL APPROACHES FOR THEIR TREATMENT REMAINS A CENTRAL THERAPEUTIC CHALLENGE. OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED TO SUGGEST THAT THE GUT MICROBIOTA HAS SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIOR, IN PART, THROUGH THE REGULATION OF IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION. THE GUT MICROBIOTA AFFECTS IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OF SHORT CHAIN FATTY ACIDS (SCFAS) AND OTHER MECHANISMS. THERE ARE THREE MAJOR SCFAS: BUTYRATE, PROPIONATE, AND ACETATE, OF WHICH, BUTYRATE APPEARS TO HAVE THE MOST PRONOUNCED EFFECTS ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. PREBIOTICS ARE DIETARY FIBERS THAT PROMOTE THE GROWTH OR ACTIVITY OF GUT MICROORGANISMS, WHICH LEADS TO ENHANCED WELL-BEING OF THE HOST; THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF MULTIPLE DIFFERENT BACTERIA SPECIES, INCLUDING BUTYRATE-PRODUCING BACTERIA. IN LIGHT OF THE EMERGING EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS SCHIZOPHRENIA IS CHARACTERIZED BY MULTIPLE ABNORMALITIES OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, WHICH LEAD TO A PRO-INFLAMMATORY STATE, THE PROPOSED R61 AND R33 PROJECTS ARE DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PREBIOTIC ADMINISTRATION WILL LEAD TO INCREASED PRODUCTION OF BUTYRATE, THROUGH INCREASED ACTIVITY OF BUTYRATE- PRODUCING BACTERIA IN THE GUT MICROBIOTA; THE INCREASE IN SERUM BUTYRATE LEVELS WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION, SYMPTOMS, AND METABOLIC MEASURES.

HOWEVER, THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL GAP IN UNDERSTANDING THE NEURAL REORGANIZATION THAT TAKES PLACE AS A RESULT OF MEDITATION TRAINING. CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF THIS GAP REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM BECAUSE, UNTIL IT IS FILLED, DESIGN OF MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. THE LONG- TERM GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH SAFE AND EFFECTIVE METHODS OF PROMOTING EMOTIONAL HEALTH IN ADOLESCENTS. THE OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO STUDY ADOLESCENTS UNDERGOING MEDITATION TRAINING BY USING MRI CONNECTOMICS TO MAP CHANGES IN NODE STRENGTH (INTEGRATED CONNECTIVITY) OF THE PUTAMEN. THE PUTAMEN IS A REGION PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH MEDITATION PRACTICE AND ATTENUATED SHRINKAGE WITH AGE IN ZEN MEDITATORS ON THE ONE HAND, AND WITH LOVE, COMPASSION, ANTICIPATION OF PLEASURE, AND RESPONSES TO INCREASING INTENSITY OF HAPPINESS ON THE OTHER HAND. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY OF THE PUTAMEN WITH OTHER BRAIN REGIONS WILL INCREASE IN ADOLESCENTS WITH MEDIATION TRAINING AND, IN TURN, POSITIVELY AFFECT THEIR EMOTIONAL HEALTH. THIS INNOVATIVE MODEL IS ROOTED IN PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND PREVIOUS LITERATURE. THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED MRI CONNECTOMICS APPROACH IS THAT REGULAR ENGAGEMENT OF THE PUTAMEN IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE MYELINATION OF THE WHITE MATTER TRACKS CONNECTING IT TO OTHER REGIONS, WHICH CAN BE PROBED BY USING DIFFUSION MRI. GUIDED BY STRONG PRELIMINARY DATA, THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY PURSUING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS, WHICH ENTAIL STUDYING CHANGES IN THE PUTAMEN NODE STRENGTH AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH MEASURED AS INTERNALIZING PROBLEMS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN 1) A COHORT OF HEALTHY ADOLESCENTS WITH A 12-WEEK MEDITATION TRAINING COMPARED TO WAITLIST CONTROLS (R61 PHASE) AND 2) A COHORT OF ADOLESCENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION WITH A 12-WEEK MEDITATION TRAINING COMPARED TO WAITLIST CONTROLS (R33 PHASE). THE \u201cGO/NO-GO CRITERION\u201d IS A MEDIUM-LARGE INCREASE OF THE PUTAMEN NODE STRENGTH OBSERVED WITH MEDITATION TRAINING IN HEALTHY ADOLESCENTS IN THE R61 PHASE (COHEN'S D>0.6). THE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY FOR THE R33 PHASE IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT ANHEDONIA (DIMINISHED ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE) IS A KEY CHARACTERISTIC OF DEPRESSION AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT PUTAMEN STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY IS LOWER IN ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION. IT IS THEREFORE EXPECTED THAT THE MECHANISTIC EFFECT IN THE PUTAMEN WILL BE AMPLIFIED IN THE POPULATION OF DEPRESSED ADOLESCENTS, REFLECTING NORMALIZATION OF THE PUTAMEN FUNCTION. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE, BECAUSE IT USES ADVANCED MRI CONNECTOMICS METHODS TO MAP CHANGES IN BRAIN NETWORKS OF YOUTH WITH MEDITATION TRAINING AND TESTS A NOVEL MECHANISTIC MODEL. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT, BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED TO GREATLY ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEURAL MECHANISM BY WHICH MEDITATION IMPROVES EMOTIONAL HEALTH OF ADOLESCENTS.

THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, PRACTICE, AND LEGISLATION SURROUNDING THE MEDICAL USE OF CANNABIS HAS BEEN STEADILY ON THE RISE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, WITH PAIN REDUCTION AND ALLEVIATION OF ANXIETY AS ITS TOP INDICATIONS. IN ADDITION, KRATOM, A COFFEE-LIKE PLANT CONTAINING COMPOUNDS THAT CAUSE OPIOID AND STIMULANT EFFECTS, HAS ALSO GAINED POPULARITY FOR SELF-TREATMENT OF SEVERAL SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING CHRONIC PAIN, PRESCRIPTION OPIOID DEPENDENCE, AND ANXIETY. A RECENT SURVEY OF KRATOM USERS REPORTED THAT THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF KRATOM USE WAS CANNABIS USE, SPECIFICALLY CANNABIDIOL (CBD). INDEED, THE MARKETING AND SALE OF KRATOM AND CBD SIDE BY SIDE IS ON THE RISE, REPRESENTED BY SHOPS SUCH AS CBD KRATOM\u00a9. TO DATE THERE ARE NO STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AND HOW KRATOM AND CANNABIS CONSTITUENTS MAY INTERACT. THEREFORE, IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND 1) THE UNIQUE AND SHARED PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF CANNABIS AND KRATOM CONSTITUENTS, AND 2) WHETHER AND HOW THESE CONSTITUENTS MAY ACT WHEN USED TOGETHER TO IMPACT POTENTIAL EFFICACY AND ADVERSE EFFECTS. THE WARD LABORATORY WAS THE FIRST TO REPORT THAT THE NON- PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABIS CONSTITUENT CBD SIGNIFICANTLY ATTENUATED CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NEUROPATHIC PAIN IN MICE, AND THIS EFFECT INVOLVED INTERACTIONS WITH THE SEROTONIN 5-HT1A RECEPTOR. MOST RECENTLY, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT ANOTHER CANNABIS CONSTITUENT CANNABIGEROL (CBG) ALSO ATTENUATES MECHANICAL SENSITIVITY IN A MOUSE MODEL OF OXALIPLATIN ASSOCIATED NEUROPATHIC PAIN, THIS TIME THROUGH CANNABINOID AND ADRENERGIC MECHANISMS. THE RAWLS LABORATORY FIRST REPORTED IN 2020 THAT THE BIOACTIVE ALKALOID OF KRATOM, MITRAGYNINE, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OXALIPLATIN-INDUCED MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA IN RATS, AND THIS EFFECT INVOLVED INTERACTIONS WITH \u039c-OPIOID RECEPTORS AND ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS.

THUS, COMBATTING THIS DISEASE WILL REQUIRE A MULTIPRONG APPROACH THAT INCLUDES PREVENTATIVE MEASURES SUCH AS VACCINES AND STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE TRANSMISSION AS WELL AS EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS. ALTHOUGH RECENT ADVANCES IN A MALARIA VACCINE AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS ARE POISED FOR SUCCESS, THE EFFICACY OF AVAILABLE SMALL MOLECULE DRUGS IS THREATENED BY THE EXPONENTIAL RISE IN DRUG-RESISTANCE IN PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM (P.

AREA PROJECT IS TO UNCOVER THE GENETIC BASIS REGULATING SOYASAPONIN ACCUMULATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VALUE-INCREASED CROPS TO BOOST THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM AND FOR ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE. THIS PROJECT IS URGENT AND SIGNIFICANT TO MEET CURRENT AND FUTURE UNPREDICTED PANDEMICS.  SOYASAPONINS ARE A GROUP OF NATURALLY OCCURRING PHYTOCHEMICALS IN LEGUME SPECIES AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BOOST THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM. THEY ALSO EXHIBIT ANTI-VIRAL, ANTI-CANCER, AND ANTI-DIABETIC ACTIVITIES. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS BEEN PREDOMINANTLY LIMITED TO EXAMINATIONS OF SOYASAPONIN'S MEDICINAL PROPERTIES, BUT ITS BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY IS NOT COMPLETE AND LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS MOLECULAR DETERMINATION IN REGULATING SOYASAPONIN ACCUMULATION. THE LACK OF FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THESE IMPORTANT BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS LIMITS THE SUCCESS OF PLANT METABOLIC ENGINEERING TO DEVELOP SOYASAPONIN-RICH CROPS. THE VALUE-IMPROVED STAPLE CROPS, SUCH AS SOYBEAN, CAN BE CONSUMED VIA A DAILY DIET TO BOOST IMMUNITY AND CAN BE MADE GLOBALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS. THIS PROJECT IS THE FIRST TO BRIDGE THIS CRITICAL GAP AND EXAMINE THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS REGULATING SOYASAPONIN VARIATION IN NATURAL PLANTS APPLYING INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES, SUCH AS GENOMICS, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND CRISPR-CAS9 GENE EDITING.  THE RESEARCH GOAL WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY COMPLETION OF THE FOLLOWING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATE GENES REGULATING SOYASAPONIN PRODUCTION IN WILD SOYBEANS, THE WILD PROGENITOR OF CULTIVATED SOYBEAN WITH A LARGE GENE POOL; AND 2) TO VALIDATE GENE FUNCTION OF IDENTIFIED CANDIDATE GENES IN CONTRIBUTING TO SOYASAPONIN PRODUCTION USING STATE-OF-THE-ART CRISPR-CAS9 GENE EDITING SYSTEM.  OUR SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION HERE IS SIGNIFICANT AS IT WILL ADDRESS A CRUCIAL FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF MOLECULAR BASIS REGULATING VITAL PHYTOCHEMICAL PRODUCTION IN NATURAL PLANTS. SPECIFICALLY, OUR STUDY WILL IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR COMPONENTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS IN SOYASAPONIN PRODUCTION. PROJECT RESULTS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD EFFICIENT PLANT METABOLIC ENGINEERING AND/OR MOLECULAR BREEDING TO DEVELOP VALUE-INCREASED SOYBEAN CULTIVARS TO BOOST THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM THROUGH DIET AND ULTIMATELY LEAD TO ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF CANCER AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES.

HOWEVER, COMBINING BDS WITH ANTICANCER DRUGS CAN INADVERTENTLY LEAD TO LIFE-THREATENING ADVERSE EVENTS (AES). A\u00c7AI (EUTERPE OLERACEA MART.) IS AMONG THE TOP 40 BOTANICALS USED IN THE U.S., AND CANCER PATIENTS INCREASINGLY USE A\u00c7AI BDS TO COMPLEMENT THEIR CONVENTIONAL CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS. WE FOUND THAT CONCOMITANT USE OF A\u00c7AI AND ANTICANCER DRUGS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK FOR VASCULAR AES AND THAT 57% OF AES INVOLVING CONCOMITANT USE OF A\u00c7AI INCLUDED SYMPTOMS OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS AND SERIOUS OUTCOMES. THIS EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THE INTERACTION OCCURS. OUR LONG-TERM GOALS ARE TO DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE PRECLINICAL APPROACH FOR IDENTIFYING CLINICALLY-RELEVANT INTERACTIONS INDUCED BY BDS AND, ULTIMATELY, TO IMPROVE TREATMENT OUTCOMES. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT, (1) WHEN CO-ADMINISTERED IN HUMANS, A\u00c7AI BDS INTERACT WITH ORAL ANTICANCER DRUGS VIA PHARMACOKINETIC NON- CYP3A4 ENZYMES (OTHER CYP ISOFORMS) AND/OR DRUG TRANSPORTERS SUCH AS P-GLYCOPROTEIN AND ORGANIC- ANION-TRANSPORTING POLYPEPTIDES, OR PHARMACODYNAMIC MECHANISMS, AND THAT, (2) THIS INTERACTION CREATES THE POTENTIAL FOR CLINICALLY RELEVANT DRUG INTERACTIONS THAT RESULT IN AES. AIM 1: DETERMINE THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR AES CAUSED BY CONCOMITANT USE OF A\u00c7AI BDS AND ORAL ANTICANCER DRUGS. WE SELECTED 2 FDA-APPROVED BREAST CANCER DRUGS (METHOTREXATE AND TAMOXIFEN) WITH DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF ACTION AND METABOLISM TO ESTABLISH PROOF OF CONCEPT. WE WILL DO SO USING A\u00c7AI BERRY RAW MATERIAL AND BDS EXTRACTS (AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PASSIVELY AND NON-PASSIVELY-DIFFUSED CONSTITUENTS). AIM 1A: INVESTIGATE THE NON-CYP3A4 PHARMACOKINETIC OR DRUG-TRANSPORTER INTERACTION MECHANISMS. AIM 1B: EVALUATE THE PHARMACODYNAMIC MECHANISM OF INTERACTION. AIM 2: APPLY METABOLOMICS-BASED CHEMOMETRICS TO IDENTIFY A\u00c7AI BDS CONSTITUENTS THAT PRODUCE AES. WE WILL USE CHEMOMETRICS TO IDENTIFY A\u00c7AI COMPOUNDS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE A\u00c7AI BDS-ANTICANCER DRUG INTERACTION. AIM 2A. CHEMOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF A\u00c7AI PLANT AND BDS EXTRACTS AND OTHER SELECTED A\u00c7AI SAMPLES. AIM 2B. IDENTIFY THE COMPOUNDS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE A\u00c7AI BDS-ANTICANCER DRUG INTERACTIONS.  OUR TEAM HAS COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE IN NATURAL PRODUCTS RESEARCH, METABOLISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, CHEMOTHERAPY, VASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY, AND CHEMOMETRICS, AS WELL AS A RECORD OF STUDENT MENTORSHIP.

WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BRAIN WASTE CLEARANCE CAN BE ACCELERATED BY A MECHANOCEUTICS TREATMENT KNOWN AS CRANIAL OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATION (COM). COM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED IN THE OUTPATIENT SETTING FOR VARIOUS NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND HAS BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE BY CROSS DISCIPLINARY STUDIES. ALTHOUGH IN CLINICAL PRACTICE SINCE 1930\u2019S, LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF COM MOLECULAR MECHANISMS LIMIT PUBLIC AWARENESS AND INTEREST ON THIS NON-INVASIVE TREATMENT WHICH HAS POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE. THEREFORE, IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECT OF COM TREATMENT USING EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL MODELS OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO STUDY THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF COM INDUCED IMPROVEMENT IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION, CNS FLUID CIRCULATION AND RELEVANT CHANGES IN PROTEIN EXPRESSION USING AGED AND TRANSGENIC RAT MODEL OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE. IN THIS RESEARCH WORK, WE WILL CARRY OUT THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS OF COM: AIM 1. TO DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF COM ON SPATIAL LEARNING AND MEMORY IN TRANSGENIC AND NATURALLY AGED RAT MODEL OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE. OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS WITH EXPERTISE IN COM WILL, BY WEARING CUSTOM MADE TACTILE PRESSURE MONITORING NANO-SENSOR GLOVES, APPLY QUANTIFIABLE MECHANICAL PRESSURE AROUND THE FOURTH VENTRICLE WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING FLUID CIRCULATION IN THE RAT BRAIN. THIS TREATMENT INDUCED IMPROVEMENT IN LEARNING AND MEMORY WILL BE STUDIED BY TWO INDEPENDENT BEHAVIORAL ASSAYS. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL REVEAL THE CHANGES IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION PRODUCED BY TRANSFERRING COM TO AN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL MODEL OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE. AIM 2. TO DEMONSTRATE COM INDUCED IMPROVEMENT IN BRAIN FLUID CIRCULATION IN LIVE RATS. WE WILL STUDY THE CHANGES IN THE KINETICS OF RADIOACTIVE TRACER FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE MOVEMENT THROUGH CISTERNA MAGNA, DEEP CERVICAL LYMPH NODES AND HEART USING DYNAMIC POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING. FURTHER A DYNAMIC CONTRAST-ENHANCED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING WILL BE PERFORMED TO STUDY SPATIOTEMPORAL CHANGES IN GADOLINIUM SIGNAL INTENSITY TO DETERMINE SOLUTE MOVEMENT VELOCITY. THESE LIVE ANIMAL IMAGING STUDIES WILL REPORT COM MEDIATED EFFECTS IN CNS FLUID CIRCULATION. AIM.3 TO IDENTIFY MOLECULAR LEVEL CHANGES IN SUBSTRATES OF LEARNING AND MEMORY AND BRAIN FLUID CIRCULATION IN COM TREATED ANIMALS. QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOASSAYS WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO STUDY THE EXPRESSION OF MACROMOLECULES INCLUDING AMYLOID AND MARKERS OF LYMPHANGIOGENESIS, WATER HOMEOSTASIS AND SYNAPTIC SUBSTRATES OF LEARNING AND MEMORY. COLLECTIVELY, THESE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS ON THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF COM EFFECTS OBSERVED IN AIM 1 AND 2. OVERALL, THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO STUDY THE BIOLOGY OF A MEDICAL PRACTICE THAT IS NOT GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS PART OF CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE.

A KEY GOAL OF THIS CONFERENCE IS TO ACTIVELY DISSEMINATE IMPORTANT RESEARCH FINDINGS TO THE ACUPUNCTURE AND TRADITIONAL EAST ASIAN MEDICINE (TEAM) RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND MULTIPLE RELATED FIELDS OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. THE PRIMARY CO-SPONSORS OF THIS CONFERENCE WILL BE THE DEPARTMENT OF ANESTHESIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND THE OSHER CENTER FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL. OUR PROGRAM WILL FOCUS CONTENT ON THREE MAJOR ISSUES: 1) THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) PANDEMIC, 2) THE CHRONIC PAIN/OPIOID AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN THE U.S., AND 3) THE ROLE OF DISPARITIES IN INTEGRATIVE HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING THEIR UNDERLYING IMPACT ON PUBLIC POLICY. PANEL DISCUSSIONS WITH KEY INTERNATIONAL FIGURES WILL EXPLORE THESE TOPICS WITH EMPHASIS ON STRENGTHENING THE RESEARCH BASE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. SAR MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR PLENARY SYMPOSIA ON RELEVANT TOPICS OF THEIR CHOICE. OUR MEETING WILL ALSO INCLUDE LECTURES FROM THOUGHT LEADERS SPANNING DIFFERENT AREAS OF BASIC AND CLINICAL TEAM RESEARCH, AS WELL AS A KEYNOTE PRESENTATION BY THE DIRECTOR OF NCCIH. THIS CONFERENCE STRUCTURE WILL BE UNLIKE ANY PAST SAR GATHERING. DUE TO THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, OUR 2021 EVENT WILL EITHER BE A HYBRID MEETING, WITH BOTH IN-PERSON AND VIRTUAL CONTENT, OR IT WILL BE AN ENTIRELY VIRTUAL MEETING. THIS IS NECESSARY AS SOME ATTENDEES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TRAVEL AND ATTEND OUR EVENT SAFELY. A COLLATERAL BENEFIT OF HAVING SOME CONTENT BE VIRTUAL IS THAT ATTENDEES UNABLE TO TRAVEL WILL STILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS, THE CONFERENCE PLAN WAS SET AFTER AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HYBRID AND VIRTUAL OPTIONS. BY THE DATE OF OUR 2021 CONFERENCE, SAR WILL ALSO HAVE HAD ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH VIRTUAL CONFERENCE FORMATS FROM TWO INTERNATIONAL ONLINE MEETINGS CURRENTLY PLANNED. WE WILL LEVERAGE THE EXPERIENCE FROM THESE VIRTUAL GATHERINGS TO PLAN FOR THIS 2021 CONFERENCE. OUR AIMS ARE: 1) TO PROVIDE AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM FOR RESEARCHERS TO DISSEMINATE AND ASSESS ACUPUNCTURE AND TEAM FINDINGS IN ORDER TO CLARIFY AND STRENGTHEN THE EVIDENCE BASE, AND 2) TO FOSTER INTERDISCIPLINARY DIALOGUE AND COLLABORATION TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES THAT ADDRESS CURRENT CHALLENGES IN ACUPUNCTURE AND TEAM RESEARCH, SHAPING THE FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA. THE SAR 2021 CONFERENCE WILL PRESENT A PLATFORM WHEREIN RESEARCHERS FROM VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS CAN SHARE, EXPLORE, AND DEVELOP NOVEL RESEARCH STRATEGIES.

VENOM RESEARCH IS GROWING EXPONENTIALLY, AS EVIDENCED BY THE INCREASE IN VENOM PUBLICATIONS, SYMPOSIA, BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS AND BIOTECH STARTUP COMPANIES, LEADING TO IMPORTANT SOCIO- ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON SOCIETY. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM RECENTLY DESIGNATED VENOMICS AS ONE OF THE FOUR MOST PROMISING FRONTIERS OF SCIENCE, AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CLASSIFIED SNAKEBITE AS A \u201cCATEGORY A NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASE\u201d AND LAUNCHED A GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF SNAKEBITE ENVENOMING.

CONDITION AFFECTING OVER 20% OF POSTPARTUM WOMEN AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS BLACKS AND LATINAS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS LEADING TO A SEVERE INCREASE IN THE RATE OF DEPRESSION WHILE THE US IS ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH DEEP-SEATED INEQUITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR BLACK AND LATINA POPULATIONS. THE US PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE RECENTLY RECOMMENDED THAT WOMEN AT INCREASED RISK OF PPD SHOULD BE REFERRED FOR COUNSELING TO REDUCE THE RISK OF PPD. HOWEVER, NUMEROUS PATIENT- LEVEL (E.G. LACK OF TIME OR MONEY) AND SYSTEM-LEVEL BARRIERS (E.G. SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS), NOW COMPOUNDED WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, POSE CHALLENGES TO THE RECEIPT OF COUNSELING, PARTICULARLY AMONG BLACK AND LATINA POPULATIONS THAT ALREADY EXPERIENCED A LOWER RATE OF TREATMENT INITIATION. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR EVIDENCE- BASED ACCESSIBLE AND SCALABLE MENTAL HEALTH CARE OPTIONS FOR THESE HIGH-RISK AND VULNERABLE WOMEN. MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS (MBIS) ARE EFFECTIVE AND THEORY-DRIVEN INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, STANDARD MBIS REQUIRE 30+ HOURS OF IN-PERSON OR ONLINE SESSIONS FOR 8 WEEKS AND ARE OFTEN TOO INTENSE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WITH HIGH DEPRESSION SYMPTOM BURDEN. OUR PILOT STUDY OF A SELF-PACED, SMALL DOSAGE (10-20 MINUTES/DAY FOR 6 WEEKS), MOBILE-BASED (MHEALTH) MBI FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WITH HIGH DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS DEMONSTRATED PROMISING FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY RESULTS IN REDUCING DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR A FULLY-POWERED TRIAL. WE WILL CONDUCT A HYBRID EFFECTIVENESS- IMPLEMENTATION STUDY TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MHEALTH MBI TO REDUCE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS IN BLACK AND LATINA PREGNANT WOMEN AT INCREASED RISK OF PPD, AND EXAMINE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF IMPLEMENTATION WITHIN A LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THE STUDY WILL TAKE PLACE AT KAISER PERMANENTE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA (KPNC), AN INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH A DIVERSE POPULATION AND COMPREHENSIVE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. KPNC\u2019S UNIVERSAL PERINATAL DEPRESSION SCREENING PROGRAM WILL BE LEVERAGED TO EFFICIENTLY IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE WOMEN.

WE WILL PARTNER WITH HEADSPACETM AND TAILOR THE DIGITAL PLATFORM TO DELIVER THE MINDFULNESS PROGRAM AND OBTAIN ADHERENCE DATA. PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES OF DEPRESSION (PRIMARY OUTCOME), ANXIETY, STRESS AND SLEEP (SECONDARY OUTCOMES), AND ATTENTION MONITORING AND ACCEPTANCE (TARGET ENGAGEMENTS) WILL BE COLLECTED 3 TIMES DURING THE STUDY (BASELINE, POST INTERVENTION, AND 4 WEEKS POSTPARTUM).

HOWEVER, SEVERAL IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS REMAIN WHICH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE UNDERTAKING A LARGE- SCALE STUDY. WE NEED TO: 1) RECRUIT AND TRAIN TEAMS OF CHIROPRACTORS FROM ESTABLISHED CHIROPRACTIC CARE CLINICS, REFINE OUR INTERVENTIONS, AND ASSESS FIDELITY OF INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS; 2) ESTABLISH INFRASTRUCTURE IN PREPARATION FOR A MULTI-SITE TRIAL INCLUDING COORDINATED INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OVERSIGHT, DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS HARMONIZED DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING PROCEDURES ACROSS SITES; AND 3) REFINE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PROCEDURES ACROSS MULTIPLE SETTINGS, AND TO OTHER GROUPS, PARTICULARLY MEN, WHO WERE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR PILOT STUDY.  TO HELP INFORM THE DESIGN OF A LARGE-SCALE TRIAL WITH BOTH PRAGMATIC AND EXPLANATORY FEATURES, WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT A TWO-ARM PILOT RANDOMIZED ATTENTION-CONTROLLED TRIAL AT TWO SITES WHICH ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF SITES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE FUTURE LARGE-SCALE TRIAL. WE WILL RECRUIT AND RANDOMIZE 60 INDIVIDUALS (30 PER SITE) TO EITHER 1) 14 VISITS OF CC (6 VISITS OF CC OVER 3 WEEKS FOLLOWED BY 8 VISITS OF CC OVER 12 WEEKS); OR 2) 14 SESSIONS OF HEADACHE HEALTH EDUCATION (15-MINUTE 1:1 VIRTUAL SESSIONS FOCUSED ON PRE-DEFINED MIGRAINE- SPECIFIC TOPICS) \u2013 BOTH ADDED TO USUAL MEDICAL CARE.

BADUANJIN (BDJ) IS A UNIQUE MIND-BODY EXERCISE CONSISTING OF EIGHT MOVEMENTS THAT CAN BE PRACTICED AT HOME WITH VIDEO GUIDANCE, THEREBY MAKING IT A SUITABLE OPTION FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH KOA. OUR RECENT STUDY SHOWED THAT BDJ CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PAIN IN PATIENTS WITH KOA. HOWEVER, RESPONSES TO BDJ INTERVENTION ARE HETEROGENEOUS, AND SOME INDIVIDUALS DEMONSTRATE ONLY A MODERATE RESPONSE. THUS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR MECHANISTIC RESEARCH TO ENHANCE THE MODULATION EFFECT OF THIS PROMISING MIND-BODY THERAPY. ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF BDJ IS THE PRACTICE OF CONTROLLED FINE BODY/LIMB MOVEMENTS AND MUSCLE AND TENDON STRENGTHENING. THIS PROPERTY SUGGESTS MOTOR LEARNING AND CONTROL MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BDJ. IMPROVING MOTOR PERFORMANCE SHOULD ENHANCE THE MODULATION EFFECT OF THIS PROMISING MIND-BODY INTERVENTION. THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX (M1) IS THE PRINCIPAL BRAIN REGION OF THE MOTOR SYSTEM AND INTEGRATES INPUT FROM OTHER CORTICAL BRAIN AREAS TO GENERATE NEURAL IMPULSES THAT PASS DOWN THE SPINAL CORD AND CONTROL THE EXECUTION OF MOVEMENT. THUS, M1 MAY PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BDJ PRACTICE. TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (TDCS) IS A SAFE AND CLINICALLY APPLICABLE NEUROMODULATION TOOL THAT CAN ALTER CORTICAL EXCITABILITY AND HAS BEEN USED TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TDCS AT M1 CAN FACILITATE MOTOR PERFORMANCE. THUS, INCREASING THE EXCITABILITY OF M1 USING TDCS SHOULD BE ABLE TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE OF BDJ, INCREASING ITS MODULATION EFFECTS. FURTHERMORE, M1 IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED NEUROMODULATION TARGET FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT.

NAS EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF CHRONIC PAIN THAN THE GENERAL U.S. POPULATION AND WE HAVE SHOWN THAT PAIN-FREE NAS ARE ~3X MORE LIKELY THAN NON-HISPANIC WHITES (NHWS) TO PROSPECTIVELY DEVELOP CHRONIC PAIN. OUR WORK OVER THE PAST DECADE HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL FACTORS (DISCRIMINATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS, SOMATIC THREAT SENSITIVITY, CARDIOMETABOLIC ALLOSTATIC LOAD) THAT WORK COLLECTIVELY TO PROMOTE A UNIQUE NA PAIN RISK PHENOTYPE WE CALL \u201cSILENT\u201d SPINAL SENSITIZATION (SENSITIZATION OF SPINAL PAIN NEURONS WITHOUT SENSITIZATION OF PAIN EXPERIENCE). THIS DISCOVERY REPRESENTS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN HOW NA PAIN RISK IS CONCEPTUALIZED BECAUSE IT IS NOT DETECTIBLE BY PAIN SELF-REPORT. NAS HAVE SUFFERED GENERATIONS OF SRD DUE TO COLONIZATION (EG, GENOCIDE, CULTURAL OPPRESSION), INCLUDING FORCED REMOVAL FROM SACRED LANDS AND POLICIES THAT LEAD TO DESECRATION OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THE TRADITIONAL NA WORLDVIEW INVOLVES AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH ALL OF NATURE IS INTERCONNECTED. WITHIN THIS WORLDVIEW, ENVIRONMENTAL DESECRATION IS AKIN TO DESECRATION OF THE BODY/SOUL. THIS PROPOSAL WILL DEMONSTRATE THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SRD (RACIALIZED DISTRIBUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTIONS/HAZARDS) ON MECHANISMS OF THE NA PAIN DISPARITY (AIM 1). THE EPA'S 11 ENVIRONMENTAL (IN)JUSTICE VARIABLES WILL BE LEVERAGED TO FORM A SOCIETAL-LEVEL LATENT VARIABLE REPRESENTING RACIALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL DESECRATION THAT WILL BE LINKED TO PARTICIPANTS VIA GEOCODING. OUR PRELIMINARY WORK SHOWS THIS VARIABLE: A) EXPLAINS 87% OF THE VARIANCE IN THE ORIGINAL 11 VARIABLES, B) CORRELATES WITH THE PROPORTION OF NAS WITHIN A CENSUS REGION SUGGESTING IT ASSESSES RACIALIZED NA EXPOSURE TO POLLUTION, AND C) PROMOTES SILENT SPINAL SENSITIZATION IN NAS, BUT NOT NHWS.

THE PROGRAMMING (SELECTIVE DELIVERY OF PULSE WIDTH, FREQUENCY, AND AMPLITUDE) OF THE STIMULATION IS OFTEN PERFORMED BY TRIAL-AND-ERROR, AND IS KEPT CONSTANT (I.E., IS OPEN LOOP) BETWEEN PROGRAMMING SESSIONS. CLOSED-LOOP (CL) STIMULATION, IN CONTRAST, ADAPTS OVER TIME TO THE SYSTEM NEEDS BY AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTING THE PARAMETERS IN RESPONSE TO A MEASURED PAIN SIGNAL IN THE BODY. CL APPROACHES IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN DESIGNED BASED ON MODELS THAT MATHEMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE HOW A SYSTEM RESPONDS TO AN ACTUATION SIGNAL. CURRENT CL APPROACHES FOR PAIN, HOWEVER, ARE MODEL-FREE AND SIMPLY WAIT FOR MEASURED PAIN ACTIVITY IN THE SPINAL CORD TO CROSS A THRESHOLD BEFORE ACTIVATING SUPPRESSIVE STIMULATION. THIS ACTS AS A LOCAL ANESTHETIC, SUPPRESSING PATHOLOGICAL PAIN, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT ALSO SUPPRESSES ACUTE PAIN THAT ALERTS THE BODY TO DAMAGING STIMULI. IN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM, WE WILL ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS BY BUILDING A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR A NOVEL ADAPTIVE, MODEL-BASED CLOSED-LOOP PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATION (PNS) APPROACH FOR THE CORRECTION OF THE DYSFUNCTIONAL PAIN SYSTEM BACK TO A NORMAL PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY DESIGNING \u201cMODEL-MATCHING\u201d FEEDBACK PNS STRATEGIES, WHICH MATCH THE RESPONSE TO EXOGENOUS STIMULI (E.G. PAW RUB) OF THE CL PAIN SYSTEM IN A NERVEINJURED ANIMAL TO THAT OF A NA\u00cfVE, HEALTHY ANIMAL. IN ORDER TO MATCH RESPONSES, WE PROPOSE TO BUILD PSEUDOLINEAR TIME INVARIANT (PLTI) MODELS OF THE RESPONSE TO STIMULATION IN HEALTHY AND NERVE INJURED CONDITIONS BY COLLECTING DATA AND PERFORMING SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION. WE WILL THEN OPTIMIZE CONTROLLERS TO MINIMIZE THE ERROR BETWEEN THE RESPONSES. THESE CONTROLLERS WILL BE DESIGNED AND OPTIMIZED IN SILICO THEN TESTED IN VIVO BY CONTINUOUSLY RECORDING THE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE AND RESPONDING BY CHANGING THE AMPLITUDE AND POLARITY OF PNS PULSES HELD AT A CONSTANT FREQUENCY. THIS FRAMEWORK WILL BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED USING NOVEL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS FROM WIDE DYNAMIC RANGE (WDR) NEURONS IN THE DORSAL HORN OF THE SPINAL CORD IN NA\u00cfVE AND NERVE-INJURED RATS IN RESPONSE TO PNS AND STIMULI (E.G. STROKE OF A PAW). WDR NEURONS ARE A CELL TYPE SELECTED FOR ITS WELL DOCUMENTED DEVIATION FROM ITS BASELINE IN PAIN SYNDROMES AND ROLE AS A RELAY STATION BETWEEN PAIN RECEPTORS IN THE PERIPHERY AND THE THALAMUS IN THE BRAIN. THE THALAMUS IS THE GATEWAY FOR PAIN INFORMATION TO ENTER THE BRAIN FOR PERCEPTION AND CAN BE ACCESSED AND RECORDED FROM USING DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION (DBS) ELECTRODES IN HUMANS, MAKING IT AN IDEAL LOCATION FOR PAIN THERAPIES DESIGNED FOR TRANSLATION IN THE FUTURE.

PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS THAT ACUTE AND CHRONIC PAIN, AND ONE NIGHT OF LIGHT ALL SUPPRESSED GLYMPHATIC FUNCTION. THIS APPLICATION WILL USE THE MURINE SPARSE NERVE INJURY (SNI) MODEL TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN RESPONDS TO CHRONIC NEUROPATHIC PAIN. SLEEP COMPLAINTS ARE PREVALENT IN CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS, AND CHRONIC SLEEP RESTRICTION INCREASES PAIN SENSITIVITY IN MICE. NOREPINEPHRINE (NE), WHICH DISRUPTS SLEEP AND IS RELEASED IN STRESSFUL CONDITIONS, SUPPRESSES GLYMPHATIC FUNCTION.

THESE CONFLICTING OUTCOMES RESULT FROM THE LACK OF A MECHANISTIC APPROACH TO USING ELECTROACUPUNCTURE (EA), A FORM OF NEUROSTIMULATION. THE REASONS FOR INADEQUATE TREATMENT AND BP CONTROL ARE COMPLEX, BUT ONE REASON FOR THIS THERAPEUTIC MISALIGNMENT MAY BE AN INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION OF HTN INCLUDING AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.

ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY A DISEASE LIMITED TO ADULTHOOD, OF SERIOUS CONCERN ARE STUDIES SHOWING THAT RATES OF ADOLESCENT-ONSET T2D ARE ON THE RISE. ADOLESCENT-ONSET T2D IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER HEALTH COMORBIDITIES AND SHORTER LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN ADULT-ONSET T2D. T2D IS PREVENTABLE BY DECREASING INSULIN RESISTANCE, THE MAJOR PHYSIOLOGICAL PRECURSOR TO T2D. UNFORTUNATELY, STANDARD-OF-CARE BEHAVIORAL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS TO DECREASE INSULIN RESISTANCE THROUGH WEIGHT LOSS DEMONSTRATE INSUFFICIENT EFFECTIVENESS IN ADOLESCENTS, NECESSITATING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TARGETING NOVEL RISK FACTORS. ONE NOVEL MODIFIABLE RISK FACTOR IS DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, A PROSPECTIVE RISK FACTOR FOR WORSENING INSULIN RESISTANCE AND THE ONSET OF T2D OVER TIME, EVEN AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR OBESITY. DEPRESSION LIKELY PROMOTES INSULIN RESISTANCE THROUGH STRESS-RELATED BEHAVIOR (E.G., HEDONIC EATING, PHYSICAL INACTIVITY) AND STRESS PHYSIOLOGY (E.G., CORTISOL DYSREGULATION, STRESS REACTIVITY). IN THEORY, MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION (MBI) MAY BE DISTINCTIVELY SUITED FOR ADOLESCENTS AT-RISK FOR T2D THROUGH ITS POTENTIAL TO DECREASE DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, IMPROVE STRESS-RELATED BEHAVIOR AND PHYSIOLOGY, AND THEREBY, IMPROVE INSULIN RESISTANCE AND LESSEN T2D RISK. TO BEGIN TO TEST THIS APPROACH, WE COMPLETED A SINGLE-SITE, PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (R00 HD069516) THAT ESTABLISHED INITIAL FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITMENT, RANDOMIZATION, RETENTION, PROTOCOL ADHERENCE, AND ACCEPTABILITY/CREDIBILITY OF A 6-WEEK GROUP MBI PROGRAM, LEARNING TO BREATHE, AMONG THE TARGET POPULATION. COMPARED TO 6-WEEK GROUP COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT; A STANDARD-OF-CARE DEPRESSION INTERVENTION), MBI PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DECREASES IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND INSULIN RESISTANCE AT 6-WEEK/POST-TREATMENT FOLLOW-UP AND AT 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP IN ADOLESCENTS AT- RISK FOR T2D. DIRECTLY BUILDING UPON OUR PRIOR WORK, THE PROPOSED U01 STUDY IS A MULTISITE, PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IMPLEMENTED AT FOUR SITES IN PREPARATION FOR A FUTURE MULTISITE EFFICACY TRIAL ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF 6-WEEK GROUP MBI, RELATIVE TO ANOTHER ACTIVE TREATMENT (CBT) AND A DIDACTIC, HEALTH EDUCATION CONTROL GROUP (HEALTHED), ON DEPRESSION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE, AS WELL AS STRESS-RELATED BEHAVIOR AND STRESS PHYSIOLOGY. SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL ARE TO: (1) TEST MULTISITE FIDELITY OF TRAINING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF 6-WEEK GROUP MBI, CBT, AND HEALTHED, TO ADOLESCENTS AT-RISK FOR T2D WITH DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS; (2) EVALUATE MULTISITE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, AND ADHERENCE FOR A PROTOCOL INVOLVING RANDOMIZATION TO 6- WEEK GROUP MBI, CBT, OR HEALTHED WITH 6-WEEK/POST-TREATMENT FOLLOW-UP AND 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; AND (3) MODIFY INTERVENTION TRAINING/IMPLEMENTATION AND PROTOCOL PROCEDURES IN PREPARATION FOR A FUTURE FULLY-POWERED MULTISITE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED EFFICACY TRIAL.

DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT EMOTIONAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN OF THIS COMORBIDITY, NO EXISTING TREATMENT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES BOTH MIGRAINE DISABILITY AND ELEVATED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. DEVELOPMENT OF SCALABLE AND INTEGRATIVE TREATMENTS THAT ADDRESS BOTH MIGRAINE DISABILITY AND COMORBID DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR GAP IN MIGRAINE TREATMENT. MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (MBCT) IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED AND STANDARDIZED TREATMENT THAT IS AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE FOR REDUCING DISABILITY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH MIGRAINE. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT MBCT REDUCED MIGRAINE-RELATED DISABILITY; HOWEVER, DURING EXIT INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS NOTED THE BURDEN OF ATTENDING 8 WEEKLY IN-PERSON SESSIONS WAS A SUBSTANTIAL BARRIER TO ACCESSING CARE.

HEADSPACE \u2013 AMONG THE MOST POPULAR OF THESE PLATFORMS \u2013 HAS OVER 42 MILLION USERS. RECENT SURVEYS INDICATE THAT 11% OF U.S. ADOLESCENTS HAVE USED MINDFULNESS APPS AS A MEANS OF COPING WITH ANXIETY OR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, WHICH INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY DURING THE ADOLESCENT YEARS. A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH IMPLICATES RUMINATION AS BEING A TRANSDIAGNOSTIC RISK FACTOR INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN YOUTH. CRITICALLY, MINDFULNESS MEDITATION HAS SHOWN SIGNIFICANT PROMISE IN TARGETING RUMINATION, AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVING DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. MINDFULNESS APPS OFFER A CONVENIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR ACCESSING MINDFULNESS TRAINING, WHILE BEING INTERACTIVE AND ENGAGING FOR YOUTH. DESPITE THEIR GROWING POPULARITY AMONG TEENS, STRIKINGLY LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THESE APPS. TWO CRITICAL QUESTIONS HAVE YET TO BE ADDRESSED, WHICH ARE STRONGLY ALIGNED WITH THE NCCIH STRATEGIC PLAN: (1) WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING NEURAL AND COGNITIVE MECHANISMS THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF THESE APPS AND (2) FOR WHOM IS APP-BASED MINDFULNESS WELL-SUITED.

HATHA YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL ADJUNCTIVE APPROACH FOR DECREASING PAIN- RELATED DISABILITY AND PAIN SEVERITY, AND PREVENTING OPIOID MISUSE DURING OAT. THERE IS EVIDENCE SUPPORTING ITS EFFICACY IN OTHER CHRONIC PAIN POPULATIONS, AND YOGA MAY TARGET CRAVINGS AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR OPIOID RELAPSE.

WE WILL EVALUATE FOUR INTERVENTION COMPONENTS, ALL OF WHICH WILL BE ADDED TO OUR STANDARD GROUP YOGA CLASSES, TO DETERMINE THEIR IMPACT ON TOTAL YOGA DOSAGE RECEIVED. THESE COMPONENTS ARE: A) TWO ADDED 1:1 MEETINGS WITH THE YOGA TEACHERS; B) PROVISION OF STUDY TEACHER-LED HOME PRACTICE VIDEOS; C) MONETARY INCENTIVES FOR CLASS ATTENDANCE; AND D) TEXT MESSAGES DESIGNED TO INCREASE INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR YOGA PRACTICE. AS A SECONDARY GOAL, IN KEEPING WITH THE U01 PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT, WE WILL ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN CONDUCT THIS RESEARCH IN TWO SITES DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER AND FROM OUR PREVIOUS SITE. IN THIS STUDY, AFTER CONDUCTING PILOT WORK (PHASE 1), WE PLAN TO CONDUCT A FULLY-POWERED FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF EACH OF THE 4 INTERVENTION COMPONENTS ON YOGA DOSAGE RECEIVED.

OPIOIDS). THE JOINT COMMISSION (TJC) HAS URGED CAUTION REGARDING USE OF OPIOIDS IN HOSPITALS AND, EFFECTIVE JAN. 1 2018, TJC REQUIRED THEIR ACCREDITED HOSPITALS/FACILITIES TO PROVIDE NON-PHARMACOLOGIC OPTIONS FOR PAIN, WITH ACUPUNCTURE AS ONE OPTION. LOW-RISK AND EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE PAIN MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS ACUPUNCTURE, ARE NEEDED IN THE ED. IN OUR RECENT PRELIMINARY, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT), ED PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH PAIN >4 ON THE 0-10 NUMERIC RATING SCALE (NRS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER ACUPUNCTURE (N=23) OR USUAL CARE (N=23). PATIENTS REPORTED PAIN INTENSITY CHANGE SCORES (BASELINE TO 60 MIN) OF -3.0 UNITS FOR ACUPUNCTURE AND -1.56 UNITS FOR USUAL CARE. DECREASES IN THE RANGE OF -1.3 TO -2.0 UNITS ON THE NRS ARE CONSIDERED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS FROM THIS PILOT RCT ARE PROMISING. HOWEVER, TO STANDARDIZE AN INTERVENTION IN PREPARATION FOR A FUTURE, MULTI-SITE PRAGMATIC, DEFINITIVE RCT, FURTHER STEPS ARE NEEDED. IN THIS U01 PRAGMATIC TRIAL PROPOSAL, WE PROPOSE TO: 1) DEVELOP A \u2018RESPONSIVE MANUALIZATION\u2019 OF AN ACUPUNCTURE INTERVENTION; AND 2) CONDUCT AN IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION, EVALUATING (A) FEASIBILITY OF PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT AND DATA COLLECTION IN AN RCT; B) THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACUPUNCTURE INTERVENTION, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES, PROCESSES, BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS. SEVERAL SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE FOR PAIN RELIEF FROM ACUPUNCTURE IN THE ED IS PROMISING, BUT NEXT STEPS REQUIRE FUTURE, MULTI-SITE RCTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE PROPOSE TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF OUR REFINED STUDY PROCEDURES IN THE BRAVENET PRACTICE BASED RESEARCH NETWORK, WHICH IS A GROUP OF 15 ACTIVE US INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CLINICS. OUR U01 INCLUDES THE BRAVENET COORDINATING CENTER AT EINSTEIN AND BRAVENET CLINIC-AFFILIATED ED SITES: UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS/CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY; VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER; AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-SAN DIEGO. A TOTAL OF 150 SUBJECTS (50 PER SITE) WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER ACUPUNCTURE OR USUAL CARE (1:1 ALLOCATION). IN ADDITION, RCT PARTICIPATING PATIENTS AND ED PROVIDERS AT EACH SITE WILL PARTICIPATE IN STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF A FUTURE, MULTI-SITE, DEFINITIVE RCT. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: AIM 1. DEVELOP A MANUALIZED ACUPUNCTURE INTERVENTION; AND AIM 2. CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY RCT TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF DATA COLLECTION AND ACUPUNCTURE INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION. SUCCESSFUL CONDUCT OF THE PROPOSED MULTI-SITE U01 WILL INFORM IMPLEMENTATION OF A FUTURE, PRAGMATIC, MULTI-SITE, NON-INFERIORITY RCT OF ACUPUNCTURE COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE IN ADDITIONAL BRAVENET CLINIC-AFFILIATED EDS. COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED U01 AND THE SUBSEQUENT, PRAGMATIC RCT (UG3/UH3) COULD PROVIDE CRITICAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT INCLUSION OF ACUPUNCTURE IN EDS ACROSS THE US.

ALTHOUGH EMPIRICALLY-SUPPORTED APPROACHES ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE, ENGAGEMENT RATES ARE LOW AND PARTIAL/NON RESPONSE IS COMMON. THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE ROLE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR PTSD, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH IS AVAILABLE TO GUIDE DECISIONS ABOUT CARE. COMPASSION MEDITATION (CM), A CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICE THAT IS INTENDED TO FOSTER CONNECTEDNESS WITH OTHERS, SHOWS PROMISE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PTSD IN VETERANS. IN HEALTHY POPULATIONS, CM FOSTERS POSITIVE EMOTION AND SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, BOTH OF WHICH ARE KNOWN TO ENHANCE COPING AND RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF EXTREME STRESS. BASED ON THIS THEORETICAL RATIONALE, WE RECENTLY COMPLETED A TWO-PHASE PROOF OF CONCEPT TRIAL OF CM FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD. THE FIRST PHASE EMPLOYED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PROCEDURES TO ITERATIVELY REFINE AN EXISTING CM PROTOCOL, CBCT\u00ae (COGNITIVELY-BASED COMPASSION TRAINING), FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD. THE SECOND PHASE UTILIZED A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF CM FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD AND TO EXAMINE POTENTIAL CLINICAL IMPACT. ON THE BASIS OF PROMISING RESULTS, THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A FUTURE MULTI-SITE EFFICACY TRIAL OF CM FOR PTSD.  ALTHOUGH OUR PRIOR WORK IS AN ENCOURAGING FIRST STEP, KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN. FIRST, OUR DATA COME FROM A SINGLE SITE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE ACCEPTABILITY OF CM, SO WE PLAN TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING AND RETAINING VETERANS RESIDING IN ANOTHER AREA AS WELL AS CONFIRMING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE APPROACH TO A MORE DIVERSE SAMPLE. SECOND, OUR PREVIOUS TRIAL RELIED ON A SINGLE THERAPIST, WHO WAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OTHERS CAN BE TRAINED TO DELIVER THE APPROACH WITH FIDELITY AND TO HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE THAT OUR RESULTS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PROTOCOL RATHER THAN TO AN INDIVIDUAL. FINALLY, IN THE INTEREST OF ULTIMATELY UNDERSTANDING THE WAY IN WHICH THESE INTERVENTIONS LEAD TO SYMPTOM CHANGE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR ASSESSMENT STRATEGY, INCLUDING ADDING BEHAVIORAL METHODOLOGIES TO AUGMENT WHAT CAN BE GLEANED FROM SELF-REPORT MEASURES.

ONE PREVALENT CAUSE OF CHRONIC PAIN IS MIGRAINE. WORLDWIDE, IT IS THE 2ND MOST DISABLING NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE. WHEN YOUTH LEARN AND PRACTICE MIND AND BODY SKILLS, THE NUMBER OF HEADACHE DAYS AND ASSOCIATED DISABILITY ARE REDUCED. TYPICALLY, TRIALS HAVE TESTED NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION PACKAGES TAUGHT BY PSYCHOLOGISTS, IN FACE-TO-FACE SESSIONS, OCCURRING OVER 4 TO 8 WEEKLY MEETINGS. WHILE EFFICACIOUS, THIS MODEL IS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO MOST FAMILIES BECAUSE OF LACK OF TRAINED PROVIDERS, DISTANCE AND TRAVEL BARRIERS, AND TIME COMMITMENT TO SESSIONS. OUR RECENT PILOT STUDIES (BOTH STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDER SKILLS TRAINING PROJECTS) SHOW THAT YOUTH WHO RECEIVE OUTPATIENT PSYCHOLOGICAL CARE REPORT THAT LEARNING BREATHING, MUSCLE RELAXATION, GUIDED IMAGERY, AND BIOFEEDBACK ARE THE MOST USEFUL AND IMPACTFUL COMPONENTS OF THE LARGER TREATMENT PACKAGE. ALSO, NURSES IN HEADACHE CENTERS REPORT THAT THEY WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH AND ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING HOW TO INTRODUCE THESE SKILLS TO PATIENTS; AND PEDIATRIC HEADACHE SPECIALISTS AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ARE SEARCHING FOR EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAYS TO INTRODUCE MIND AND BODY SKILLS TO THEIR PATIENTS. THUS, WE NEED TO CONDUCT PRAGMATIC TRIALS TO TEST THE DELIVERY OF THESE INTEGRATED APPROACHES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF TYPICAL MEDICAL CARE TO CONFIRM IF THEY CAN PROVIDE BENEFIT OR NOT. BUT, DESPITE EVIDENCE OF SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND SUCCESSFUL PRIOR TRIAL EXECUTION, IT IS NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE A TREATMENT PACKAGE BY EVALUATING WHICH COMPONENTS AND DOSES OF A COMPLEX INTERVENTION ARE CRITICAL FOR CHANGES IN OUTCOMES PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING A MULTI-SITE EFFECTIVENESS TRIAL. IN THIS NCCIH U01, WE WILL OPTIMIZE A MIGRAINE PREVENTION TREATMENT PACKAGE FOCUSED ON 4 MIND AND BODY SKILLS THAT WILL BE DELIVERED BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS (FOR THIS PROJECT, NURSES) IN TWO OUTPATIENT HEADACHE CENTERS (CINCINNATI & DENVER). AN INNOVATIVE INTERVENTION REFINEMENT APPROACH, THE MULTIPHASE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY (MOST) (HTTPS://METHODOLOGY.PSU.EDU/RA/MOST) WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE NECESSARY COMPONENTS AND DOSES OF AN EFFICIENT, EFFECTIVE TREATMENT THAT CAN THEN BE TESTED AGAINST STANDARD CARE (PATIENT EDUCATION WITHOUT ANY SKILLS  = TRAINING) VIA A PRAGMATIC TRIAL. FOR THIS FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT, WE WILL ENROLL 200 YOUTH AGES 10 TO 17 YEARS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF MIGRAINE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING 4 HEADACHE DAYS PER MONTH (N = 25 PER EACH OF 8 CONDITIONS).

HOWEVER, FEW TARGETED INTERVENTIONS EXIST THAT ARE RELEVANT TO PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES AND THAT ACCOMMODATE THEIR MANY PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, AND FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO PERSONALIZED CARE. TO FILL THIS GAP, WE DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE APP-BASED MOBILE MINDFULNESS TRAINING PROGRAM THAT PROMOTES AUTOMATED CARE DELIVERY AND SELF-MANAGEMENT OF SYMPTOM-RELATED DISTRESS.  SUBSEQUENTLY, WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL (RCT) CALLED THE LIFT STUDY (R34 AT00819) THAT COMPARED MOBILE MINDFULNESS TO BOTH A STANDARD TELEPHONE MINDFULNESS PROGRAM AND AN ICU EDUCATION CONTROL AMONG SURVIVORS OF CARDIORESPIRATORY FAILURE. WE FOUND THAT MOBILE MINDFULNESS WAS FEASIBLY DELIVERED, ACCEPTABLE, USABLE, AND HAD A GREATER CLINICAL IMPACT ON PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS THAN EITHER COMPARATOR. THIS TRIAL ALSO HIGHLIGHTED OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE INTERVENTION'S IMPACT RELATED TO ITS TARGETED POPULATION, CONTENT DELIVERY, AND SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY.  TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS, WE PROPOSE A 5-YEAR PROJECT THAT IS CONCEPTUALIZED AS THE OPTIMIZATION PHASE OF A MULTIPHASE OPTIMIZATION STUDY (MOST) FRAMEWORK. WE WILL OPTIMIZE MOBILE MINDFULNESS WITH FOUR SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) OPTIMIZE THE USABILITY OF KEY TECHNOLOGICAL ELEMENTS OF MOBILE MINDFULNESS; (2) USING A FACTORIAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, IDENTIFY WHICH INTERVENTION COMPONENTS CONTRIBUTE MOST MEANINGFULLY TO FEASIBILITY, USABILITY, AND IMPACT ON PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; (3) EXPLORE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION; AND (4) USING A MIXED METHODS APPROACH AND DATA FROM AIMS 2 & 3, REFINE, UPDATE, AND OPERATIONALIZE THE FINAL MMT INTERVENTION SYSTEM. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS U01 INVOLVING 320 CARDIORESPIRATORY FAILURE SURVIVORS, WE WILL DELIVER A MOBILE MINDFULNESS SYSTEM FULLY OPTIMIZED FOR USABILITY, EFFICIENCY, SCALABILITY, AND CLINICAL IMPACT THAT WILL BE OFF-THE-SHELF READY FOR A NEXT-STEP DEFINITIVE RCT\u2014AND CAN SERVE AS A MODEL FOR DISTANCE-BASED MIND AND BODY INTERVENTIONS.  INNOVATIVE ELEMENTS OF OUR U01 PROPOSAL INCLUDE ITS PARADIGM-SHIFTING AUTOMATED STEPPED THERAPY APPROACH AND ITS EASILY DISSEMINATABLE MOBILE APP DELIVERY SYSTEM\u2014ATTRIBUTES THAT COULD ALLOW SEAMLESS, INEXPENSIVE POPULATION-LEVEL SCALING OF MMT AND OTHER MIND-BODY THERAPIES. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES RESEARCH PRIORITIES ON DISTRESS SYMPTOMS, PERSONALIZED PRECISION MEDICINE, AND SELF- MANAGEMENT OUTLINED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND NUMEROUS PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES.

SUCH DYSFUNCTIONAL STRESS REACTIVITY CAN LEAD TO DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR COMMUNITY, INCLUDING UNJUSTIFIED SHOOTINGS, SEVERE BEATINGS, AND FATAL CHOKINGS. IT CAN ALSO LEAD TO SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LEOS, INCLUDING ELEVATED INCIDENCE OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, BURNOUT, ALCOHOL MISUSE, DEPRESSION, AND SUICIDE. A RECENT META-ANALYSIS OF LEO STRESS REDUCTION PROGRAMS FOUND LITTLE EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SUCH APPROACHES ARE EFFECTIVE, HIGHLIGHTING THE URGENT NEED FOR PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS TARGETING THE STRESS INHERENT TO POLICING. MINDFULNESS TRAINING IS A PROMISING APPROACH WITH HIGH- STRESS POPULATIONS THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING STRESS AND INCREASING RESILIENCE. OUR RECENT PILOT FEASIBILITY STUDY (R21AT008854) ESTABLISHED INITIAL FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND ADHERENCE TO PROCEDURES IN A SINGLE-SITE RCT ASSESSING MINDFULNESS-BASED RESILIENCE TRAINING (MBRT), A PREVENTIVE INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO IMPROVE LEO MENTAL HEALTH AND RESILIENCE, AND REDUCE AGGRESSION AND EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE. THE R21 DATA SUGGEST PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AND POTENTIAL CLINICAL BENEFIT IN A SAMPLE OF LEOS. RELATIVE TO WAITLIST CONTROL, MBRT PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS REACTIVITY, AGGRESSION, BURNOUT, OCCUPATIONAL STRESS, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY. IMPLEMENTED AT TWO SITES, THE PROPOSED STUDY IS DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH OPTIMAL PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES FOR A FUTURE FULL-SCALE, MULTI-SITE TRIAL ASSESSING EFFECTS OF MBRT VERSUS AN ATTENTION CONTROL (STRESS MANAGEMENT EDUCATION) AND A NO-INTERVENTION CONTROL, ON PHYSIOLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES.

THESE FINDING HAVE IGNITED EFFORTS TO PRECISELY MODULATE GUT MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION AND FUNCTION TO PROMOTE HEALTH-ASSOCIATED FEATURES. THE NUTRIENT LANDSCAPE WITHIN THE GUT SHAPES, AND IS INFLUENCED BY, THE GUT MICROBIOTA. BACTERIA RESPOND TO AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS AND UTILIZE THEM TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN METABOLISM, SHARING THE METABOLIC BY-PRODUCTS WITH OTHER BACTERIA AND THE HOST. CARBOHYDRATES WITHIN THE GUT, BOTH CONSUMED IN THE DIET AND PRODUCED BY THE HOST, IMPACT GUT BACTERIA COMPOSITION AND FUNCTION VIA THEIR UTILIZATION AS A CARBON SOURCE. THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF THE POLYSACCHARIDES THAT COVER GUT BACTERIA HOWEVER, REMAINS UNCLEAR. BACTERIAL CELL SURFACE POLYSACCHARIDES ACT AS A BARRIER BETWEEN THE MICROBE AND ITS ENVIRONMENT, ENHANCING BACTERIAL GROWTH AND SURVIVAL THROUGH MECHANISMS THAT INCLUDE RESISTANCE TO TOXIC SMALL MOLECULES, NUTRIENT ADAPTATION, AND IMMUNE EVASION.

THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT MOST PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGIN THAT IS THE RESULT OF EARLY DISTURBANCES IN THIS COMPLEX PROCESS. ADOLESCENCE IS A PERIOD IN WHICH EXPOSURE TO ALTERED ENVIRONMENTAL LIGHTING IS DECIDEDLY COMMON, AS 50% OF ADOLESCENTS IN THE USA REPORTED USING COMPUTERS, SMARTPHONES, AND TABLETS BEFORE BEDTIME. THIS INTENSITY OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND THE DURATION OF EXPOSURE PAST SUNSET IS UNPRECEDENTED IN HUMAN HISTORY. DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD EXPOSURE TO NIGHT-TIME LIGHT IN ADOLESCENTS, OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH OUR BRAIN ADAPTS TO IRREGULAR ENVIRONMENTAL LIGHTING IS STILL INCOMPLETE. THE MEDIAL AMYGDALA (MEA) PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN PROCESSING EMOTIONS AND IS ALSO ONE OF THE REGIONS, AMONG OTHERS, THAT RECEIVES AND PROCESSES LIGHT INFORMATION. THUS, ARTIFICIAL CHANGES IN LIGHT EXPOSURE LEVELS, TIMING, AND REGULARITY MIGHT GENERATE CONFUSING SIGNALS IN THIS REGION, AFFECTING NEUROPLASTICITY AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES. TO STUDY WHETHER LIGHT AFFECTS NEUROPLASTICITY IN THE MEA, THEREBY INCREASING VULNERABILITY TO ANXIETY AND RISK-DECISION MAKING IN ADOLESCENT MICE, I DEVELOPED A NEW ABERRANT LIGHT PROTOCOL DESIGNED TO MIMIC HUMAN ADOLESCENT LIGHT EXPOSURE.

TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL (TRP) CHANNELS DETECT A WIDE RANGE OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL STIMULI, AND THROUGH THEIR INTEGRATION OF AND RESPONSE TO THESE STIMULI HAVE AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF MANY CHRONIC PAIN DISORDERS. NOTABLY, MANY NATURAL PRODUCTS FROM PLANTS AND VENOMOUS ANIMALS TARGET TRP CHANNELS, AND CAN THEREFORE BE USED TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE THESE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO PAIN SENSATION. FOR INSTANCE, TRP MELASTATIN 8 (TRPM8), THE SOMATOSENSORY RECEPTOR GATED BY COLD TEMPERATURES, IS ALSO ACTIVATED BY NATURAL COOLING AGENTS, SUCH AS MENTHOL AND EUCALYPTOL, COMMONLY USED TOPICAL ANALGESIC AGENTS. FURTHERMORE, TRPM8 IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLD ALLODYNIA, A DEBILITATING HYPERSENSITIVITY TO COLD RESULTING FROM CHEMOTHERAPY OR OTHER NEUROPATHIC INSULTS. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF TRPM8 AND OTHER TRP CHANNELS TO THE TRANSITION FROM ACUTE TO CHRONIC PAIN STATES, THE MOLECULAR BASIS FOR LIGAND BINDING, CHANNEL GATING, AND ION PERMEATION REMAIN INCOMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISMS WHEREBY TRPM8 CONDUCTS IONS ACROSS CELLULAR MEMBRANES IN RESPONSE TO DIVERSE SIGNALS, INCLUDING THOSE FROM PLANT-DERIVED COMPOUNDS THAT PRODUCE A COLD SENSATION. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO: 1) DETERMINE ATOMIC STRUCTURES OF TRPM8 IN DIFFERENT CONFORMATIONAL STATES (K99 PHASE), 2) STUDY THE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF TRPM8 (K99 PHASE), AND 3) PROBE MECHANISMS OF TRPM8 MODULATION BY PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL LIPIDS (R00 PHASE).

THE PRACTICES OF YOGIC BREATHWORK HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDING SLEEP AND NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. WHILE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS ARE STILL NOT FULLY KNOWN, ONE PREVIOUSLY STUDIED MECHANISM FOR THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGIC BREATHWORK IS THROUGH PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AS EVIDENCED BY DECREASED RESPIRATION RATE, HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE, AND INCREASED HEART RATE VARIABILITY. ANOTHER MECHANISM FOR EXPLAINING THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGIC BREATHWORK CAN BE ITS DIRECT INFLUENCE ON CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) CIRCULATION, WHICH TO DATE HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED DUE TO LACK OF NON-INVASIVE METHODOLOGY. CSF CIRCULATES BY BULK FLOW (MACROCIRCULATION) AROUND THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) WHILE ENSURING THE HEALTH OF THE CNS. CSF UNDERGOES PERIODIC PULSATIONS DUE TO ARTERIAL PULSATION AND RESPIRATION. WHILE CARDIAC-DRIVEN CSF HAS BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY, RESPIRATORY-DRIVEN CSF IS NOT VERY WELL-UNDERSTOOD DUE TO LACK OF REAL-TIME NON-INVASIVE APPROACHES. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, WE HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A REAL-TIME PHASE-CONTRAST MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (RT-PCMRI) TECHNIQUE, AND DEMONSTRATED THAT DEEP SLOW ABDOMINAL BREATHING - COMPARED TO NATURAL BREATHING - INCREASES THE AMPLITUDE OF THE CSF FLOW VELOCITIES WHILE LOWERING THE FREQUENCY OF RESPIRATORY-DRIVEN CSF FLOW, SUGGESTING THAT BREATHING PATTERNS HAVE QUASI-IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE ON THE MODULATION OF CSF CIRCULATION. ADDITIONALLY, CSF CIRCULATION PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING GLYMPHATIC FUNCTION (MICROCIRCULATION), WHICH IS A RECENTLY IDENTIFIED BRAIN-WIDE CLEANING MECHANISM THAT SUPPORTS THE RAPID INTERCHANGE OF CSF AND INTERSTITIAL FLUID (ISF), AND FACILITATES THE CLEARANCE OF SOLUTES AND METABOLIC WASTES FROM THE BRAIN INTERSTITIUM, PREFERENTIALLY DURING SLEEP COMPARED TO WAKEFULNESS. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE GLYMPHATIC FUNCTION IN HUMAN BRAIN, WE HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A NOVEL NON-INVASIVE IMAGING APPROACH INCORPORATING SIMULTANEOUS POLYSOMNOGRAPHY AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY MEASUREMENTS ACROSS SLEEP-WAKES CYCLES, WHICH INDICATED ENHANCED GLYMPHATIC ACTIVITY DURING SLEEP, PARTICULARLY IN SLOW WAVE SLEEP.

OPIOIDS ARE THE MAINSTAY OF PAIN THERAPY FOR SCD, BUT ARE OFTEN INEFFECTIVE AND ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS. POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF USING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY (E.G. ACUPUNCTURE, HYPNOSIS, TAI CHI, YOGA) HAVE BEEN REPORTED, BUT NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY APPLIED DUE TO LACK OF COMPELLING EVIDENCE. IN A HUMANIZED TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL OF SCD, ELECTROACUPUNCTURE (EA) WAS ADMINISTERED WITHOUT USING ANESTHESIA OR RESTRAINTS. WE OBSERVED INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN ANALGESIA PRODUCED BY EA, AND THE INTENSITY OF PAIN REDUCTION POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE EXPRESSION OF PERIPHERAL/CENTRAL INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS. THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF VARYING ANALGESIA NEED TO BE EXPLORED IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO POTENTIATE THE INSUFFICIENT PAIN RELIEF OF THE POOR RESPONDERS TO EA. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO 1) DETERMINE WHETHER THE LEVELS OF SPECIFIC INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS (E.G. SUBSTANCE P, TNF-A, IL-1SS, IL-6) CONTRIBUTE TO THE VARIED ANALGESIC EFFECT OF EA IN SICKLE MICE, 2) DEMONSTRATE THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING HYPERALGESIA THAT TARGET INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS HAMPER THE ANALGESIC EFFECT OF EA IN POOR RESPONDERS, AND 3) DETERMINE THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE LEVELS OF SELECTED CIRCULATING BIOMARKERS AND THE DEGREE OF ACUPUNCTURE ANALGESIA IN SICKLE PATIENTS, AND HOW THEY CORRELATE WITH THE CHANGES OF RESTING STATE FMRI AND SPECIFIC BRAIN NEUROMETABOLITES WITH THE INTERVENTION OF ACUPUNCTURE.

THE CANDIDATE'S ULTIMATE CAREER GOAL IS TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT, EXTRAMURALLY-FUNDED SCIENTIST WITH EXPERTISE IN AFFECTIVE SOMATOSENSATION AND ITS ROLE IN COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH MODALITIES. THE NEUROSCIENCE OF AFFECTIVE SOMATOSENSATION IS VERY YOUNG AND HOLDS LARGE GAPS. WHILE AN AFFECTIVE-SENSORY AFFERENT TYPE FOR LIGHT STROKING TOUCH IS KNOWN (THE C LOW THRESHOLD MECHANORECEPTOR; C-LTMR), WE DO NOT YET UNDERSTAND WHY DEEP PRESSURE TOUCH IS PLEASANT, AND WE UNDERSTAND VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE ROLE OF OPIOIDS IN AFFECTIVE TOUCH PERCEPTION. AFFECTIVE SOMATOSENSATION IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF NUMEROUS COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES INCLUDING MASSAGE THERAPY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE SENSORY AFFECTIVE PATHWAYS OF LIGHT STROKING AND DEEP PRESSURE TOUCH AND DETERMINE HOW AND WHY THESE PATHWAYS DIFFER IN INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC PAIN. EACH AIM OF THE PROPOSAL IS SUPPORTED BY COURSEWORK, RESEARCH TRAINING EXPERIENCES, SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS AND SEMINARS, AND A DETAILED RESEARCH PLAN.  THE K99 PERIOD OF THE PROPOSAL AIMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PLEASANTNESS OF DEEP PRESSURE TOUCH IS DEPENDENT ON PRESSURE-SENSITIVE C-LTMR AFFERENTS IN MUSCLE TISSUE AND TO DETERMINE WHAT ROLE OPIOIDS PLAY IN THE PLEASANTNESS OF LIGHT STROKING AND DEEP PRESSURE TOUCH IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. THE R00 PERIOD WILL DETERMINE WHY INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC PAIN SHOW REDUCED AFFECTIVE SENSORY PROCESSING AND ALTERED OPIOID INTERACTIONS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS K99/R00 RESEARCH PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE THE CANDIDATE WITH EXPERTISE IN SENSORY AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF PSYCHOPHYSICAL TESTING AND BRAIN IMAGING UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF AN EXPERIENCED TEAM OF SCIENTISTS. THE CANDIDATE IS CURRENTLY A POSTDOCTORAL IRTA FELLOW IN THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH WHERE SHE IS MENTORED BY DR. M. CATHERINE BUSHNELL, A LEADING EXPERT IN PAIN AND AFFECTIVE SOMATOSENSATION, WITH ACCESS TO EXCELLENT FACILITIES FOR CONDUCTING NERVE BLOCKS, SENSORY TESTING, AND BRAIN IMAGING.

THESE FINDING HAVE IGNITED EFFORTS TO PRECISELY MODULATE GUT MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION AND FUNCTION TO PROMOTE HEALTH-ASSOCIATED FEATURES. THE NUTRIENT LANDSCAPE WITHIN THE GUT SHAPES, AND IS INFLUENCED BY, THE GUT MICROBIOTA. BACTERIA RESPOND TO AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS AND UTILIZE THEM TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN METABOLISM, SHARING THE METABOLIC BY-PRODUCTS WITH OTHER BACTERIA AND THE HOST. CARBOHYDRATES WITHIN THE GUT, BOTH CONSUMED IN THE DIET AND PRODUCED BY THE HOST, IMPACT GUT BACTERIA COMPOSITION AND FUNCTION VIA THEIR UTILIZATION AS A CARBON SOURCE. THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF THE POLYSACCHARIDES THAT COVER GUT BACTERIA HOWEVER, REMAINS UNCLEAR. BACTERIAL CELL SURFACE POLYSACCHARIDES ACT AS A BARRIER BETWEEN THE MICROBE AND ITS ENVIRONMENT, ENHANCING BACTERIAL GROWTH AND SURVIVAL THROUGH MECHANISMS THAT INCLUDE RESISTANCE TO TOXIC SMALL MOLECULES, NUTRIENT ADAPTATION, AND IMMUNE EVASION. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS I WILL TEST IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT MICROBIOTA BACTERIAL POLYSACCHARIDES MODULATE GUT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION VIA UTILIZATION AS A NUTRIENT BY OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND THROUGH INTERACTION WITH SOLUBLE IMMUNOREGULATORY PROTEINS. AIM 1 WILL EMPLOY ISOLATED BACTERIAL POLYSACCHARIDES AND IN VITRO GROWTH ASSAYS TO IDENTIFY GENETIC FEATURES THAT ENABLE UTILIZATION OF BACTERIAL POLYSACCHARIDES.

THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN IS CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH DEGREE OF NEURAL PLASTICITY IN WHICH CIRCUIT-LEVEL FORMATION IS VERY RESPONSIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT MOST PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGIN THAT IS THE RESULT OF EARLY DISTURBANCES IN THIS COMPLEX PROCESS. ADOLESCENCE IS A PERIOD IN WHICH EXPOSURE TO ALTERED ENVIRONMENTAL LIGHTING IS DECIDEDLY COMMON, AS 50% OF ADOLESCENTS IN THE USA REPORTED USING COMPUTERS, SMARTPHONES, AND TABLETS BEFORE BEDTIME. THIS INTENSITY OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND THE DURATION OF EXPOSURE PAST SUNSET IS UNPRECEDENTED IN HUMAN HISTORY. DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD EXPOSURE TO NIGHT-TIME LIGHT IN ADOLESCENTS, OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH OUR BRAIN ADAPTS TO IRREGULAR ENVIRONMENTAL LIGHTING IS STILL INCOMPLETE. THE MEDIAL AMYGDALA (MEA) PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN PROCESSING EMOTIONS AND IS ALSO ONE OF THE REGIONS, AMONG OTHERS, THAT RECEIVES AND PROCESSES LIGHT INFORMATION. THUS, ARTIFICIAL CHANGES IN LIGHT EXPOSURE LEVELS, TIMING, AND REGULARITY MIGHT GENERATE CONFUSING SIGNALS IN THIS REGION, AFFECTING NEUROPLASTICITY AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES. TO STUDY WHETHER LIGHT AFFECTS NEUROPLASTICITY IN THE MEA, THEREBY INCREASING VULNERABILITY TO ANXIETY AND RISK-DECISION MAKING IN ADOLESCENT MICE, I DEVELOPED A NEW ABERRANT LIGHT PROTOCOL DESIGNED TO MIMIC HUMAN ADOLESCENT LIGHT EXPOSURE. THIS PATHWAY TO INDEPENDENCE AWARD WILL PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON MY EXPERTISE IN NEUROBIOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE WHILE DEVELOPING MY ABILITIES IN FIBER PHOTOMETRY AND RNA-SEQUENCING. AIM 1 IS BUILT UPON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWING THAT ABERRANT LIGHT EXPOSURE ALTERS NEUROTRANSMITTER PLASTICITY IN THE MEA OF ADOLESCENT MICE, AND THAT SUCH NEUROPLASTICITY CONTRIBUTES TO THEIR VULNERABILITY TO ANXIETY AND RISKY BEHAVIORS. UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF DR. BARNES AND DR. YOUNG, I WILL USE THE IOWA GAMBLING TASK TO TEST WHETHER ABERRANT LIGHT EXPOSURE ALTERS RISK-TAKING BEHAVIORS DIFFERENTLY IN ADOLESCENT AND ADULT MICE. WITH ADDITIONAL MENTORSHIP FROM DR. RAMANATHAN IN THE K99 PHASE, I WILL EXPLORE WHETHER ABERRANT LIGHT AFFECTS NEURAL ACTIVITY IN SELECTED MEA NEURONS USING FIBER PHOTOMETRY-BASED CALCIUM RECORDING IN BEHAVING MICE. IN AIM 2, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF DR. PREISSL, I WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER ABERRANT LIGHT EXPOSURE AFFECTS GENE EXPRESSION IN MEA NEURONS AND ITS TARGET REGIONS PARTICIPATING IN ANXIETY AND RISKY CHOICE BEHAVIORS, SUCH AS THE CENTRAL AMYGDALA AND THE BED NUCLEUS OF THE STRIA TERMINALIS. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL PREPARE ME FOR THE R00 PHASE IN WHICH I WILL STUDY THE ROLE OF AMYGDALA CIRCUITRY IN LIGHT-MEDIATED ANXIETY AND RISKY BEHAVIOR BY COMBINING PHARMACOLOGICAL MANIPULATION OF AMYGDALAR NEURONS, FIBER PHOTOMETRY, AND TRANSLATIONAL MOUSE MODELS (AIM 3).

ABSTRACT PROJECT SUMMARY IN THIS K23 PROPOSAL I DETAIL A 5-YEAR TRAINING PLAN THAT WILL LAUNCH MY CAREER AS AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS FOR CARDIAC ARREST (CA) SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILIES. BACKGROUND: EXPERIENCING A CA IS CONTINUOUSLY TRAUMATIC RESULTING IN EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IN SURVIVORS (UP TO 61%) AND THEIR INFORMAL CAREGIVERS (UP TO 40%). UNLIKE OTHER CRITICALLY ILL POPULATIONS WITH ESTABLISHED SURVIVORSHIP PROGRAMS, CA SURVIVOR-CAREGIVER DYADS (PAIRS) ARE UNDER-RESOURCED AND UNPREPARED TO MANAGE SURVIVORSHIP, WHICH EXACERBATES EMOTIONAL DISTRESS. UNTREATED EMOTIONAL DISTRESS POST-CA BECOMES CHRONIC AND UNDERMINES CLINICAL AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES. ADDRESSING EMOTIONAL DISTRESS EARLY AFTER CA BY TEACHING MIND-BODY SKILLS AND PROVIDING RESOURCES MAY PREVENT CHRONIC EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. SPECIFIC AIMS: I PLAN TO DEVELOP, REFINE, AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A DYADIC MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR CA SURVIVORS WITH GOOD NEUROLOGIC RECOVERY AND THEIR INFORMAL CAREGIVERS (\u201cRECOVERING TOGETHER AFTER CARDIAC ARREST;\u201d RT-CA). MY AIMS ARE THREE-FOLD: 1) DEVELOP RT-CA THROUGH EVIDENCE-BASED FRAMEWORKS (DYADIC INTERDEPENDENCE, RESPONSE SHIFT FRAMEWORK, FAMILY STRENGTH VULNERABILITY MODEL, RESILIENCE AS A PROCESS) AND EVIDENCE-BASED SKILLS (FROM COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY, DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY, ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION), INPUT FROM INTERVIEWS WITH CA SURVIVOR-CAREGIVER DYADS (N=~12), AND FOCUS GROUPS WITH CA MEDICAL STAKEHOLDERS (N=4 GROUPS); 2) REFINE RT-CA THROUGH AN OPEN PILOT (N=5 DYADS) WITH EXIT INTERVIEWS (FOR FEEDBACK) AND PRE-POST ASSESSMENTS (FOR INITIAL FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY); 3) TEST RT-CA FOR FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY (N=42 DYADS) THROUGH A PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL (RCT) OF RT-CA COMPARED TO A MINIMALLY ENHANCED USUAL CONTROL. TRAINING: MY RESEARCH AIMS ARE SUPPORTED BY THREE TRAINING GOALS: 1) ADVANCED QUALITATIVE METHODS FOR DYADIC INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT; 2) MIXED METHODS FOR DYADIC INTERVENTION REFINEMENT (INTEGRATING EXIT INTERVIEW QUALITATIVE DATA WITH PRE-POST ASSESSMENT QUANTITATIVE DATA); 3) DYADIC MIND-BODY RCT METHODOLOGY. MY MULTI-DISCIPLINARY MENTORSHIP TEAM IS LED BY DR. ANA-MARIA VRANCEANU, A CLINICAL HEALTH PSYCHOLOGIST AND EXPERT IN DEVELOPING AND REFINING DYADIC-MIND BODY INTERVENTIONS, AND DRS. MICHAEL DONNINO AND SARAH PERMAN, EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS AND EXPERTS IN CA CLINICAL TRIALS AND CA OUTCOMES RESEARCH RESPECTIVELY. MY TRAINING GOALS ARE SUPPORTED BY 1) COMMITTED, MULTI-DISCIPLINARY MENTORS, 2) A RICH INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AT MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL AND HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, AND 3) TARGETED COURSEWORK, HEALTH EQUITY AND DIVERSITY TRAININGS, SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS, SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS, AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING.

IN THIS APPLICATION, THE CANDIDATE PROPOSES A SIGNIFICANT AND INNOVATIVE PROPOSAL THAT IS DIRECTLY TIED WITH HIS PROPOSED TRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT GOALS. BACKGROUND: PAINFUL NONTRAUMATIC DEGENERATIVE UPPER EXTREMITY CONDITIONS ARE COMMON AND RISKY SUBSTANCE USE COMMONLY OCCURS IN THESE CONDITIONS. WHEN THESE CO-OCCUR, THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK FOR HIGHER PAIN AND DISABILITY, WHICH ARE CHALLENGING TO TREAT. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON ADAPTING TO THESE PAINFUL CONDITIONS. THE TOOLKIT FOR OPTIMAL RECOVERY (TOR) IS A BRIEF, LIVE VIDEO MIND-BODY PROGRAM AIMED AT PREVENTING CHRONIC PAIN IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE INJURIES, WHICH IS AMENABLE FOR ADAPTATIONS FOR THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS WITH PAINFUL NONTRAUMATIC DEGENERATIVE UPPER EXTREMITY CONDITIONS AND RISKY SUBSTANCE USE. SPECIFIC AIMS AND RESEARCH DESIGN: THE PROPOSED STUDY AIMS TO I) IDENTIFY TREATMENT NEEDS AND PREFERENCES OF ADULT (18+) NEW PATIENTS WITH NON-TRAUMATIC PAINFUL, UPPER EXTREMITY CONDITIONS WITH RISKY SUBSTANCE USE WHO SEEK CARE IN THE OUTPATIENT ORTHOPEDIC DEPARTMENT, VIA LIVE VIDEO FOCUS GROUPS (N=3 GROUPS; UP TO N=20 PATIENTS) TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASYNCHRONOUS WEB-BASED TIRELESS AND STUDY PROCEDURES; 2) CONDUCT AN OPEN PILOT TO EXPLORE INITIAL FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND CREDIBILITY OF WEB-TIRELESS AND STUDY METHODS (N=12 PATIENTS) USING PRE/POST- TESTS AND EXIT INTERVIEWS; 3) CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY RCT OF WEB-TIRELESS VS. WEB-MEUC (N=50) TO DETERMINE 1) FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITMENT, SCREENING, ELIGIBILITY, ENROLLMENT, RANDOMIZATION, AND ASSESSMENT PROCESSES, AND 2) FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE WEB-TIRELESS AND WEB-MEUC. FINDINGS WILL INFORM AN EFFICACY TRIAL THROUGH THE ROI MECHANISMS. TRAINING AND MENTORING: STUDY AIMS ARE SUPPORTED BY 3 MAIN TRAINING GOALS AIMED AT DEVELOPING EXPERTISE IN 1) QUALITATIVE AND MIXED METHODS RESEARCH SKILLS (VRANCEANU); 2) CONDUCT OF MIND-BODY CLINICAL TRIALS IN 01THOPEDICS (VRANCEANU, RING, CHEN, DITRE); AND 3) DEVELOPMENT OF ASYNCHRONOUS WEB-BASED PLATFORMS AND MHEALTH APPROACHES (SYLVIA, VRANCEANU).

THE CANDIDATE (DR. TONY V PHAM), A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT, UNDERREPRESENTED IN MEDICINE PSYCHIATRIST, WILL FOCUS HIS CAREER ON DEVELOPING AND RIGOROUSLY TESTING MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS WITH BETTER ACCESS AND RELEVANCE TO UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES. IN THIS APPLICATION, THE CANDIDATE PROPOSES TO ADDRESS THE CHRONIC PAIN-DEPRESSION CO-MORBIDITY IN THE OLDER BLACK COMMUNITY BY CULTURALLY ADAPTING MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (MBCT). AMONG OLDER BLACKS, CHRONIC PAIN CO-OCCURS WITH DEPRESSION, AND THIS CO-MORBIDITY WORSENS PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION; HOWEVER, BLACKS FACE MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO EVIDENCE-BASED NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL PAIN AND DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT INCLUDING SYSTEMIC RACISM, STIGMA, AND THE LACK OF CULTURALLY TAILORED CARE. A CULTURALLY TAILORED MBCT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SOLUTION TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL OUTCOMES AMONG THIS UNDERSERVED POPULATION. THIS K23 WILL DEVELOP QUIET FOCUS, A CULTURAL ADAPTATION OF MBCT FOR OLDER BLACKS WITH CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND CO-OCCURRING DEPRESSION. MY PRELIMINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY REVEALED STRONG INTEREST IN QUIET FOCUS, SUPPORT FOR MBCT\u2019S RELEVANCE TO THE COMMUNITY, AND INTEREST IN PARTICIPATION ONLY IF THE INTERVENTION IS ABBREVIATED AND IS DELIVERED BY A LAY INSTRUCTOR FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY. IN AIM 1, I WILL DEVELOP QUIET FOCUS USING GUIDANCE FROM THE OLDER BLACK COMMUNITY WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND CO-OCCURRING DEPRESSION. THE STARTING POINT FOR QUIET FOCUS WILL BE AN ABBREVIATED, EVIDENCE-BASED MBCT PROTOCOL (8 60-MINUTE SESSIONS) DEVELOPED BY CO-MENTOR SHALLCROSS. I WILL TRAIN LAY INSTRUCTORS UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF CO-MENTOR JOO AND DEVELOP A FIDELITY PROTOCOL UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF PRIMARY MENTOR VRANCEANU AND CO-MENTOR SHALLCROSS. IN AIM 2, I WILL TRAIN A BLACK LAY INDIVIDUAL TO DELIVER QUIET FOCUS AND ASSESS PRELIMINARY FEASIBILITY AND FIDELITY. IN AIM 3, I WILL TRAIN A NEW BLACK LAY INDIVIDUAL TO DELIVER QUIET FOCUS AND ANOTHER TO DELIVER A TIME- AND DOSE-MATCHED CONTROL. I WILL THEN CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY RCT OF QUIET FOCUS AND CONTROL AND ASSESS DEFINITIVE FEASIBILITY BENCHMARKS INCLUDING FIDELITY. THESE PROPOSED EFFORTS WILL INFORM AN EFFICACY TRIAL THROUGH THE R01 MECHANISM (PRIMARY OUTCOME IS PHYSICAL FUNCTION) AS WELL AS FUTURE STUDIES AIMED AT GENERALIZING THIS WORK TO OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS.

CURRENT TREATMENTS FOR BED, SUCH AS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) PRODUCE SUBOPTIMAL RESULTS BECAUSE THEY ONLY TARGET OVER-RESTRICTION. MINDFULNESS MEDITATION (MM) TARGETS EMOTION DYSREGULATION AND COULD THUS BE AN IMPORTANT ADDITION TO CBT FOR EATING DISORDERS. FURTHERMORE, DIGITAL DELIVERY OF AN MMT FOR BED WOULD OFFER UNPRECEDENTED SCALABILITY, BUT THERE ARE NO CURRENT DIGITAL MMTS FOR BED. THE CURRENT K23 PROPOSAL INVOLVES DEVELOPING A DIGITAL MINDFULNESS MEDITATION-ENHANCED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT-MM) FOR BED VIA TWO PHASES. CBT-MM WILL TARGET THE TWO DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF BED (DIETARY OVER-RESTRICTION AND EMOTION DYSREGULATION). IN PHASE 1, I WILL FINALIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL CBT-MM VIA INTERVIEW-BASED USER TESTING. IN PHASE 2, I WILL CONDUCT A PILOT FEASIBILITY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT).

ADHD IS A CENTRAL ELEMENT IN AN EARLY CAUSAL PATHWAY TO FUTURE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY DISORDERS, SUBSTANCE MISUSE, JOB AND RELATIONSHIP FAILURES, CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS, SUICIDE, AND PREMATURE DEATH. IT IS, THEREFORE, A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY. PERHAPS THE MOST IMPAIRING SINGLE FEATURE OF ADHD, WHICH CUTS ACROSS DISORDERS AND REMAINS DIFFICULT TO TREAT, IS EXTREME EMOTIONAL DYSREGULATION (ANGER, MOODINESS, AND IRRITABILITY).

THESE INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE (IV) SEQUELAE CAN BE ALLEVIATED BY REDUCING DISTRESS, YET CULTURALLY SENSITIVE TRANSDIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES TO REDUCE SURVIVOR DISTRESS ACROSS ETHNO- RACIAL POPULATIONS ARE RARE. WE PROPOSE TO USE COMMUNITY-ENGAGED RESEARCH TO DEVELOP A COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE PROGRAM THAT INTEGRATES ADAPTED MINDFUL SELF-COMPASSION (MSC) TRAINING WITH TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (TIY) TO IMPROVE STIGMA SEQUELAE AND REDUCE DISTRESS IN ETHNO-RACIALLY DIVERSE SURVIVORS: INTEGRATED TIY AND MSC (I-YMSC). MSC TARGETS STIGMA-RELATED PROBLEMS (AFFECT DYSREGULATION, SHAME) AND IMPROVES DISTRESS IN THE LONG-TERM, YET CAN TEMPORARILY INCREASE SHORT-TERM DISTRESS. TIY REDUCES SHORT-TERM DISTRESS AND PROMOTES PHYSIOLOGICAL-AUTONOMIC REGULATION. DR.

THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL UNMET NEED FOR NON-PHARMACOLOGIC STRATEGIES TO AUGMENT MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF RA, IMPROVE LONG-TERM CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AND REDUCE DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS.  PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS IS POSTULATED TO EXACERBATE DISEASE SEVERITY IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE PROSPECTIVELY EXAMINED ITS IMPACT ON DISEASE ACTIVITY IN RA PATIENTS OR THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF INTERVENTIONS THAT IMPROVE STRESS RESILIENCE IN THIS PATIENT GROUP. FURTHERMORE, WHILE MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS (MBIS), INCLUDING THE MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION PROGRAM (MBSR), HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND PAIN IN SEVERAL CHRONIC DISEASES, IT REMAINS UNKNOWN WHETHER THEY REPRESENT AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE APPROACH FOR IMPROVING DISEASE OUTCOMES IN RA. TO ADDRESS THESE SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS, I PROPOSE TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF STRESS, STRESS-BUFFERING FACTORS, AND MBIS ON RISK OF DISEASE FLARES AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY IN RA AND RELATED AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS.

SALUTOGENESIS MAY INVOLVE THE USE OF SINGLE OR MULTIPLE INTERVENTIONS. THESE MAY AFFECT MULTIPLE TARGETS TO RESTORE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS AFFECT WHOLE PERSON HEALTH. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP METHODS TO STUDY MULTISYSTEM SIGNATURES OF HEALTH RESTORATION OBTAINED THROUGH MULTIPLE INTERVENTIONS BOTH AT THE LEVEL OF THE ORGAN AND THE WHOLE ORGANISM. CURRENTLY, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING NON-PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE RESILIENCE TO COGNITIVE DECLINE DURING AGING. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL USE A MOUSE MODEL OF AGE-RELATED COGNITIVE DECLINE TO STUDY MOLECULAR SIGNATURES AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH RESTORATION OF HEALTHY COGNITIVE FUNCTION. WE WILL EVALUATE TWO INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO IMPROVE COGNITION IN AGED MICE I.E. EXERCISE AND A WATER EXTRACT (CAW) OF THE BOTANICAL CENTELLA ASIATICA. EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD C57BL/6 MALE AND FEMALE MICE WILL BE RANDOMIZED INTO AN EXERCISE GROUP (VOLUNTARY ACCESS TO A RUNNING WHEEL), A CAW GROUP (1000 MG/KG/DAY, ADMINISTERED IN THE DRINKING WATER), A GROUP THAT RECEIVES BOTH CAW AND EXERCISE, AND A CONTROL GROUP THAT RECEIVES NEITHER INTERVENTION EACH FOR A PERIOD OF 35 DAYS. UNTREATED MALE AND FEMALE YOUNG (4 MONTH OLD) MICE WILL SERVE AS YOUNG CONTROLS. WE WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THESE TWO INTERVENTIONS, SEPARATELY AND COMBINED, ON FOUR HEALTH MEASURES: COGNITION, GLOBAL INFLAMMATORY STATUS, GLOBAL OXIDATIVE STRESS AND MOBILITY USING MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, BLOOD C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, BLOOD 8-HYDROXYDEOXYGUANOSINE AND DIGIGAIT RESPECTIVELY. AT THE CONCLUSION OF TREATMENT, HIPPOCAMPAL TISSUE FROM THE ANIMALS WILL BE COLLECTED AND TRANSCRIPTOMICS AND METABOLOMICS ANALYSIS WILL BE PERFORMED. WE WILL INITIALLY IDENTIFY GENES OR METABOLITES (SINGLY OR IN CLUSTERS) THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED BY THE TREATMENTS. THIS -OMICS DATA WILL THEN BE INTEGRATED WITH THE BEHAVIORAL AND BLOOD DATA TO CREATE COMPUTATIONAL MODELS THAT WILL BE USED TO DERIVE THE UNIQUE MOLECULAR SIGNATURES AND HEALTH DATA ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED COGNITION. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE WHETHER THE MOLECULAR SIGNATURE CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIVE IMPROVEMENT ARE A REVERSAL OF THOSE SEEN IN COGNITIVE DECLINE (YOUNG VS OLD UNTREATED ANIMALS), OR REPRESENT A NEW SALUTOGENIC PATHWAY. A HETEROGENOUS MULTI-LEVEL NETWORK (HMLN) MODEL WILL BE USED TO DESCRIBE AND EVALUATE THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN ALL HEALTH OUTCOMES DESCRIBED HERE AND THE MOLECULAR DATA. ULTIMATELY, SIMILAR HMLN MODELS CAN BE USED AS A BASIS TO IDENTIFY THE TIMING AND TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE OPTIMAL FOR RESTORING COGNITIVE HEALTH. THE METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS CAN THEN BE EXPANDED BEYOND COGNITION TO ENCOMPASS OTHER ASPECTS OF WHOLE ORGANISM HEALTH.

PROMS ARE STANDARDIZED, VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY PATIENTS TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR HEALTH STATUS. IN ADDITION TO SERVING AS A MARKER OF HIGH-QUALITY LBP CARE, PROM USE MAY IMPACT PAIN-RELATED CLINICAL PRACTICE BY FACILITATING SHARED DECISION MAKING AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, ENABLING PROGRESS ASSESSMENT TO EVALUATE TREATMENT PLAN APPROPRIATENESS, AND POSSIBLY POSITIVELY INFLUENCING HEALTH STATUS (INCLUDING PAIN LEVEL AND PAIN-RELATED ABILITY). HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EXTENT OF TRANSLATION OF THE RECOMMENDED USE OF PROMS IN USUAL PRACTICE BY CHIROPRACTORS. THE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH IN THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DESCRIBE THE USE OF VALIDATED PROMS IN LBP MANAGEMENT IN VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA) CHIROPRACTIC CLINICS AND PERFORM FEASIBILITY PILOT TESTING OF A POINT-OF-CARE CDS ALERT TO FACILITATE USE IN THE DOCUMENTATION WORKFLOW. AN ADAPTATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL WILL BE USED AS THE THEORETICAL BASIS FOR INCREASING USE OF PROMS BY CHIROPRACTORS THROUGH A TECHNOLOGY-BASED INTERVENTION. IN AIM 1, WE WILL QUANTIFY THE CURRENT NATIONAL DOCUMENTATION OF VALIDATED PROMS DURING LBP CARE BY VHA CHIROPRACTORS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ON ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD DATA. IN AIM 2, WE WILL SURVEY VHA CHIROPRACTORS TO UNDERSTAND PRIORITIES AND CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DOCUMENTATION AND CLINICAL WORKFLOW FOR PROM USE AND CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT. THIS \u201cCOMMUNITY-BASED\u201d APPROACH TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WILL ASSESS THE ACCEPTANCE, USABILITY, AND APPROPRIATENESS OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD BASED CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT ALERT AS AN INTERVENTION TO PROMOTE PROM USE. IN AIM 3, WE WILL CONDUCT A SINGLE-ARM FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY PILOT OF THE DEVELOPED CDS ALERT IN FOUR VHA CHIROPRACTIC CLINICS, MEASURING PRELIMINARY INTERVENTION ADOPTION, FEASIBILITY, AND ACCEPTABILITY AS OUTCOMES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND REFINE METHODS IN SUPPORT OF A FULL-SCALE PRAGMATIC TRIAL TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A CDS ALERT INTERVENTION ON HIGH-QUALITY LBP CARE DELIVERY, INCLUDING CLINICIAN USE OF PROMS AS A QUALITY MARKER, AND ON PATIENT OUTCOMES IN CHIROPRACTIC CLINICS AND OTHER CARE SETTINGS COMMONLY MANAGING LBP.

PRATSCHER MENTORED TRAINING EXPERIENCES THAT WILL ACCELERATE HIS TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE AS A PRODUCTIVE RESEARCHER INVESTIGATING COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES FOR CHRONIC PAIN, WHOLE PERSON HEALTH, AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. CHRONIC PAIN IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF HUMAN SUFFERING, AND CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON, COSTLY, AND BURDENSOME PAIN CONDITIONS. PAIN IS A SENSORY AND AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS, SUCH AS EMOTIONAL DISTRESS (E.G., DEPRESSION), STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS (E.G., TRAUMA), AND UNEXPRESSED EMOTIONS (E.G., ANGER), CONTRIBUTE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE PERSISTENCE OF PAIN. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR INTEGRATIVE TREATMENTS THAT ADDRESS THIS COMPLEXITY OF CHRONIC PAIN AND PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT AND LASTING PAIN RELIEF. BREATHWORK INTERVENTIONS (I.E., THERAPEUTIC BREATHING PRACTICES) ARE PROMISING TREATMENTS BECAUSE THEY INCORPORATE ONE OF OUR MOST INTEGRATED PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES, RESPIRATION, TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS BOTH PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF CHRONIC PAIN. THEREFORE, THE AIMS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO 1) DEVELOP AND REFINE A MULTICOMPONENT BREATHWORK INTERVENTION (DERIVED FROM BIODYNAMIC BREATHWORK TRAUMA RELEASE SYSTEM) AND TO 2) ITERATIVELY EVALUATE ITS FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY IN PEOPLE WITH CLBP. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL CREATE A TREATMENT MANUAL TO GUIDE INTERVENTION SESSIONS AND ADAPT TREATMENT FIDELITY EVALUATIONS TO ASSESS THERAPIST COMPETENCE AND ADHERENCE TO THE MANUAL. THEN, WE WILL CONDUCT THREE SINGLE-ARM ITERATIONS OF THE 8-WEEK, INDIVIDUALLY DELIVERED INTERVENTION, FOLLOWED BY A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE MOST REFINED VERSION OF THE INTERVENTION TO USUAL CARE. UPON COMPLETION OF EACH ITERATION, WE WILL GATHER QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA AND MEET WITH A PANEL OF EXPERTS TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS TO THE INTERVENTION OR PROTOCOL BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THE NEXT ITERATION. THIS WORK WILL RESULT IN A REFINED AND REPRODUCIBLE MULTICOMPONENT BREATHWORK INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE TESTED FOR EFFICACY IN FUTURE RESEARCH, WHICH THE CANDIDATE PLANS TO PURSUE WITH AN R-LEVEL APPLICATION WRITTEN DURING THIS AWARD PERIOD. THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA HAS A THRIVING CLINICAL PAIN RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT THAT WILL SUPPORT THE CANDIDATE IN COMPLETING THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN. GUIDANCE FROM AN EXCELLENT MENTORING TEAM IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL TRAINING ACTIVITIES (E.G., SEMINARS, CONFERENCES, INDEPENDENT STUDY) WILL ALLOW DR. PRATSCHER TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: (1) BUILD A FOUNDATION OF KNOWLEDGE IN CHRONIC PAIN RESEARCH WITH EMPHASES ON BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL TREATMENT FACTORS; (2) OBTAIN EXPERTISE IN THE PROCESSES OF INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT, REFINEMENT, AND TESTING; AND (3) ENHANCE PROFICIENCY IN THE DESIGN AND CONDUCT OF CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEVELOP INTO A SUCCESSFUL INDEPENDENT PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR.

AFTER DECADES OF RELIANCE ON PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS FOR CHRONIC PAIN, THE RECENT AND WIDESPREAD REDUCTION IN OPIOID PRESCRIBING IS A WELCOME CHANGE. HOWEVER, IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS LIKE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE, EFFECTIVE, AND AFFORDABLE PAIN CARE. ACUPUNCTURE IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH CLBP, BUT ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE IS INCONSISTENT, MAKING ACUPUNCTURE COST PROHIBITIVE RELATIVE TO OTHER FORMS OF PAIN CARE. OUR FIRST AIM WILL MEASURE TRENDS IN ACUPUNCTURE USE AMONG A COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH CLBP USING A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF CLAIMS DATA, THEN EXAMINE CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS WHO USE ACUPUNCTURE AND IDENTIFY OTHER FORMS OF PAIN CARE THAT THEY USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH ACUPUNCTURE. WE FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH CLBP BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINTS CITED BY PATIENTS WHO ENGAGE IN ACUPUNCTURE; IT IS ALSO THE MOST COMMON INDICATION COVERED BY INSURERS, INCLUDING MEDICARE. IN OUR SECOND AIM, WE WILL EVALUATE THE ROLE OF INSURANCE DESIGN ON ACUPUNCTURE USE, SPECIFICALLY THE IMPACT OF COST SHARING LIKE COPAYS, COINSURANCE, AND DEDUCTIBLES, WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO AFFECT HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AT LARGE AND PAIN CARE IN PARTICULAR. A THIRD AIM WILL CONTEXTUALIZE THE CLAIMS-BASED FINDINGS WITH QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH INSURERS AND PAIN CARE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING ACUPUNCTURISTS, WHO WILL HELP US DEVELOP AND REFINE AN INSURER-DRIVEN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS TO ENGAGE IN EVIDENCE-BASED PAIN CARE, LIKE ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY.

SUMMARY STRESS AND CHRONIC PAIN DISORDERS ARE COMORBID CONDITIONS WHEREIN STRESS EXACERBATES PAIN. MINDFULNESS MEDITATION, A NON-OPIOIDERGIC AND SELF-REGULATORY TECHNIQUE THAT TRAINS NON-REACTIVE AWARENESS TO ARISING SENSORY AND AFFECTIVE EVENTS, REDUCES CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED PAIN AND STRESS. OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED PSYCHOPHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI) STUDY FOUND THAT FOUR, 20-MINUTE SESSIONS OF MINDFULNESS TRAINING IN HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS REDUCED STRESS ( 39%, P = .023) AND PAIN INTENSITY ( 32%, P < .001) IN RESPONSE TO NOXIOUS HEAT (49\u00b0C). STRESS REDUCTIONS ALSO PREDICTED LOWER PAIN INTENSITY (P = .013). THE PERIGENUAL ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX (PGACC), A COGNITIVE-AFFECTIVE BRAIN AREA INVOLVED IN REAPPRAISAL, AND THE AMYGDALA, A KEY BRAIN AREA INVOLVED IN SENSORY AND EMOTIONAL PROCESSING, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MODULATING PAIN AND STRESS AND SHARE EXTENSIVE ANATOMICAL CONNECTIONS. OUR LABORATORY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT INCREASED PGACC ACTIVITY UNDERLIES MINDFULNESS-INDUCED REDUCTIONS IN PAIN AND ANXIETY IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, WHILE MINDFULNESS-INDUCED DEACTIVATION OF THE AMYGDALA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO CORRELATE WITH PAIN AND STRESS RELIEF ACROSS SEPARATE STUDIES. DESPITE THESE FINDINGS, NO STUDY HAS DETERMINED WHETHER MINDFULNESS MEDITATION PROMOTES STRESS RELIEF AND ANALGESIA BY MODULATING THE PGACC AND CORRESPONDING NEURAL ACTIVITY IN AND CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN NOCICEPTIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT-SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS. TO THIS END, WE WILL ANALYZE THE BLOOD-OXYGEN-LEVEL-DEPENDENT FMRI DATA CORRESPONDING TO OUR BEHAVIORAL FINDINGS TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESES. WE WILL FIRST DETERMINE IF HIGHER PGACC (HYP1A) AND LOWER AMYGDALA (HYP1B) ACTIVITY DURING MINDFULNESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PAIN/STRESS RELIEF. WE WILL NEXT DETERMINE IF INCREASED PGACC-AMYGDALAR FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY CORRELATES WITH MINDFULNESS-INDUCED PAIN (HYP1C) AND STRESS RELIEF (HYP1D). OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSES FOUND THAT MINDFULNESS-INDUCED ANALGESIA CORRELATES WITH REDUCTIONS IN MACHINE-LEARNED, MULTIVARIATE FMRI SIGNATURES SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC TO NOCICEPTION (NEUROLOGIC PAIN SIGNATURE; NPS, P = .03) AND STIMULUS-INDUCED NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .01). WE WILL SIMILARLY DETERMINE IF REDUCTIONS IN NEGATIVE AFFECT BRAIN RESPONSES CORRESPOND TO STRESS RELIEF (HYP2A). FINALLY, WE WILL CONFIRM IF INCREASED NPS- (HYP2B) AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SIGNATURE- (HYP2C) PGACC CONNECTIVITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN AND/OR STRESS RELIEF.

FIRST, AN INNOVATIVE PHARMACOPHORE-BASED GENOME MINING PIPELINE WILL BE DEVELOPED (AIM 1). IN THIS AIM, PHARMACOPHORES DEDUCED FROM VIRTUAL DOCKING EXPERIMENTS AND KNOWN CATHEPSIN INHIBITORS WILL BE USED TO PREDICT ENZYMATIC DOMAINS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CREATION OF THE DESIRED PHARMACOPHORE. THIS RETROBIOSYNTHETIC PREDICTION WILL BE USED TO MAKE BIOINFORMATIC MODELS TO INTERROGATE SEQUENCED CYANOBACTERIAL GENOMES TO FIND CANDIDATE BGCS. THE BGCS OF HIGHEST INTEREST WILL BE IDENTIFIED, DELINEATED, AND THE COMPOUNDS PRODUCED THROUGH EITHER CULTIVATION OR HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION (AIM 2). USING A FULL RETROBIOSYNTHETIC PREDICTION FOR GALLINAMIDE A, A COMPOUND THAT DEMONSTRATES NANOMOLAR CATHEPSIN L INHIBITION, WE WILL SEARCH FOR THE BGC WITHIN THE GENOMIC LIBRARY AT SCRIPPS OR IN NEW CYANOBACTERIAL COLLECTIONS. ADDITIONAL BGCS FROM AIM 1 WILL BE DEVELOPED IN THIS AIM AS WELL. IF THE BGC IS NOT CONSTITUTIVELY EXPRESSED OR IF THE BGC IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A CULTIVATABLE ORGANISM, HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION WILL BE PURSUED (AIM 3). COMPOUND ISOLATION AND MOLECULAR NETWORKING TO ANALYZE AND ANNOTATE THE CHEMICAL SPACE OF THE NATURAL PRODUCTS PRODUCED WILL FOLLOW. COMPOUNDS WILL BE TESTED IN BIOASSAYS TO EVALUATE CATHEPSIN B AND L ACTIVITY ON PURIFIED ENZYMES AS WELL AS IN NEURONAL AND GLIAL CELLULAR STUDIES. THE GAP BETWEEN THE IDENTIFIED PHARMACEUTICAL NEED AND THE DISCOVERY OF NOVEL BIOACTIVE MOLECULES CAN BE BRIDGED BY THE INNOVATIVE MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH PRESENTED IN THIS APPLICATION.

AS SUCH, IT MITIGATES HYPERGLYCEMIA AFTER MEALS AND CONTRIBUTES TO IMPROVED GLYCEMIC CONTROL. HOWEVER, ACARBOSE SHOWS PROMISE FOR AMELIORATING SYMPTOMS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER DISEASES BECAUSE OF ITS IMMUNOMODULATORY AND PRO- CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS. DESPITE THE PROSPECT OF RE-PURPOSING ACARBOSE TO TREAT A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW IT ELICITS THESE HOST EFFECTS. ONE EXPLANATION LIES IN THE OBSERVATION THAT ACARBOSE ALTERS THE GUT MICROBIAL COMMUNITY IN MICE AND HUMANS. STILL, THERE ARE NO PUBLISHED REPORTS OFFERING MECHANISTIC INSIGHT INTO THESE CHANGES. BECAUSE LESS STARCH IS DIGESTED IN THE UPPER GI TRACT UPON ACARBOSE TREATMENT, IT TRANSITS TO THE LARGE INTESTINE WHERE IT IS PROCESSED AND FERMENTED INTO SHORT-CHAIN FATTY ACIDS (SCFA) BY COMMENSAL BACTERIA. SINCE ACARBOSE IS MINIMALLY ABSORBED BY THE HOST, IT LIKELY TRANSITS WITH THE STARCH TO THE LARGE INTESTINE WHERE IT MIGHT IMPACT BACTERIAL GLUCOAMYLASES UTILIZED TO PROCESS THIS POLYSACCHARIDE. RECENT DATA SUGGEST THAT COMMON HUMAN GUT COLONIZERS EXHIBIT REMARKABLY DIFFERENT GROWTH SENSITIVITIES TO ACARBOSE IN VITRO WHEN UTILIZING STARCH AS A CARBON SOURCE. A DOMINANT AND WELL-STUDIED GUT PHYLUM, THE BACTEROIDETES, DEPLOYS A STARCH UTILIZATION SYSTEM, OR SUS, TO RECOGNIZE, PROCESS, AND IMPORT STARCH, WITH THE PROTOTYPICAL SYSTEM FROM BACTEROIDES THETAIOTAOMICRON SERVING AS A MODEL. INITIAL WORK FOR THIS PROPOSAL INVOKES DISPARATE PHENOTYPES BETWEEN TWO PROMINENT SPECIES OF BACTEROIDETES: B. THETAIOTAOMICRON IS SENSITIVE TO ACARBOSE WHILE BACTEROIDES OVATUS IS RESISTANT. THIS PROPOSAL WILL DETERMINE THE MOLECULAR BASIS FOR THESE DISTINCT RESPONSES AND TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT DISCRETE MOLECULAR FEATURES OF SUS CONTRIBUTE TO DIFFERENTIAL BACTEROIDETES GROWTH INHIBITION AND OVERALL FITNESS IN THE PRESENCE OF ACA. AIM 1 WILL SYSTEMATICALLY TEST THE POSSIBILITIES THAT ACARBOSE DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECTS SUS ENZYME INHIBITION AND OLIGOSACCHARIDE RECOGNITION AND/OR TRANSPORT. AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE HOW WIDESPREAD ACARBOSE SENSITIVITY IS AMONGST THE BACTEROIDETES. IN VITRO ACARBOSE PHENOTYPES WILL BE COMPARED TO IN VIVO FITNESS AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCES BY MINING METAGENOMIC DATA-SETS FROM HUMANS. THE COMBINATION OF APPROACHES WILL TEST THE NOTION THAT IN VITRO SENSITIVITY TO ACARBOSE TRANSLATES TO REDUCED BACTERIAL FITNESS IN THE GUT. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TIMELY IN LIGHT OF RECENT WORK SUGGESTING THAT ACARBOSE MAY INFLUENCE WHOLE BODY SIGNALING IN MICE DUE TO MICROBIOTA MEDIATED ALTERATIONS IN BILE ACID POOLS. RECENT DATA ALSO SUGGESTS THAT ACARBOSE MAY BE A USEFUL TOOL TO CONTROL BACTEROIDETES ABUNDANCE IN THE GUT, A PHYLUM IMPLICATED IN THE ETIOLOGY OF NUMEROUS DISEASES. BECAUSE ACARBOSE POSITIVELY IMPACTS HOST HEALTH, A MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ACARBOSE INFLUENCES BACTERIAL GROWTH IN THE GI TRACT IS WARRANTED AND WILL LAY A FOUNDATION FOR THE DESIGN OF OTHER

MT IS THE CLINICAL USE OF TAILORED MUSIC INTERVENTIONS (E.G., ACTIVE MUSIC MAKING AND MUSIC-ASSISTED RELAXATION) TO ACCOMPLISH INDIVIDUALIZED GOALS WITHIN A THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP BY A CREDENTIALED PROFESSIONAL (I.E., BOARD-CERTIFIED MUSIC THERAPIST). DESPITE EVIDENCE FOR MT\u2019S EFFICACY FROM RCTS AND THE INCREASED DELIVERY OF MT IN CLINICAL SETTINGS, FEW CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE REAL-WORLD IMPACT OF MT WITHIN HEALTH SYSTEMS. EVALUATING INTEGRATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT APPROACHES SUCH AS MT IS A VITAL NEED, ESPECIALLY AS HEALTH SYSTEMS SEEK EFFECTIVE NONPHARMACOLOGIC PAIN MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE RISKS STEMMING FROM OPIOID USE. SUBSTANTIAL GAPS REMAIN IN UNDERSTANDING MT\u2019S CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS. THESE INCLUDE: 1) IDENTIFYING SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, AND MT INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES (PROMS); 2) COMPARING OUTCOMES (E.G., MEDICATION USE AND LENGTH OF STAY) BETWEEN PATIENTS RECEIVING MT AND SIMILAR PATIENTS RECEIVING USUAL CARE; AND 3) EXAMINING LONGITUDINAL EFFECTS ON PROMS BEYOND THE INITIAL MT SESSION.

SUCH INTERVENTIONS SEEK TO MAXIMIZE PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, AND OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING BY CHANGING HOW ONE MANAGES PAIN VIA ADDRESSING PAIN-RELATED THOUGHTS, BELIEFS, AND BEHAVIORS. THE CURRENT CP LITERATURE IS LIMITED BY THE USE OF BETWEEN-SUBJECT DESIGNS AND SELF-REPORT MEASURES THAT LACK ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO BIAS. ONE COMPONENT OF FUNCTION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, IS ABLE TO BE OBJECTIVELY MEASURED IN AN ECOLOGICALLY VALID WAY USING ACCELEROMETRY. IN FACT, PRIOR RESEARCH HAS COMBINED ACCELEROMETRY AND PAIN RATINGS COLLECTED USING ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA) TO BETTER REFLECT THE REAL-TIME, REAL-WORLD RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAIN AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.

CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IS INCREASINGLY COMMON AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH.

STILL, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW YOGA IMPROVES PAIN OUTCOMES FOR CLBP OR HOW IT COMPARES TO AND WHETHER IT OPERATES DISTINCTLY FROM OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS COMMONLY USED TO TREAT CLBP.

FOR THIS PROJECT, WE EXAMINE 1) HOW EFFECTIVE PRANAYAM IS AT REDUCING HYPERAROUSAL IN RESPONSE TO TRAUMA REMINDERS, BOTH IN SPONTANEOUS DAILY USE AND IN A DIRECTED LAB TASK, 2) WHETHER HIGHER LEVELS OF INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS INCREASE THE EFFECT THAT PRANAYAM HAS ON LOWERING HYPERAROUSAL REACTIONS, 3) IF EMOTION REGULATION SKILLS MEDIATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRANAYAM USE AND CARDIOVASCULAR REACTIVITY. WE ARE CONDUCTING THIS STUDY WITHIN A SAMPLE OF 130 FEMALE SEXUAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS. WE WILL COMPARE PRANAYAM TO A COGNITIVE-BASED COPING STRATEGY, COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL, TO DETERMINE IF PRANAYAM IS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF CALMING TRAUMA CUE-INDUCED HYPERAROUSAL. HYPERAROUSAL WILL BE DETERMINED BY CARDIOVASCULAR MEASURES OF AROUSAL, INCLUDING HEART RATE, HEART RATE VARIABILITY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE. BY ISOLATING AND EXPLICITLY TESTING DEEP BREATHING PRANAYAM, WE CAN DETERMINE IF PRANAYAM IS THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH MIND-BODY HEALTH INTERVENTIONS MAY EXERT THEIR EFFECTS. THIS SIMPLE, PARSIMONIOUS STRATEGY CAN BE EMPHASIZED AS A PRIMARY COPING STRATEGY FOR SURVIVORS WHO MAY HAVE LIMITED TIME OR FEW AVAILABLE RESOURCES. THIS PROJECT SERVES AS A TRAINING VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH THE APPLICANT CAN WORK TOWARDS HER LONG-TERM RESEARCH GOALS OF EXAMINING HOW INTEGRATIVE MIND-BODY HEALTH INTERVENTIONS MAY IMPACT THE STRESS RESPONSE IN TRAUMA-EXPOSED POPULATIONS. THIS PROJECT IS THE NEXT PHASE OF THE APPLICANT\u2019S BROADER CAREER RESEARCH GOAL OF IDENTIFYING AND UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS CAN REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, PARTICULARLY FOR TRAUMA SURVIVORS WHO ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f7d4a874-2ab3-85f8-4c06-002c8728886d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F31AT011469_7529"}, {"internal_id": 116078634, "Award ID": "F31AT011282", "Award Amount": 76814.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-01", "CFDA Number": "93.213", "Description": "THE ROLE OF CARBOHYDRATE BINDING MODULE COOPERATION IN BAAMY7 HYDROLYSIS OF RESISTANT STARCH - THE GUT MICROBIOTA PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN COLONIC HEALTH AND HOMEOSTASIS.

RESISTANT STARCH IS A PREBIOTIC THAT PREFERENTIALLY PROMOTES THE GROWTH OF SPECIALIZED BACTERIA, INCLUDING BIFIDOBACTERIUM ADOLESCENTIS. TYPE 2 RESISTANT STARCHES ARE RAW, GRANULAR STARCHES THAT ARE INACCESSIBLE TO MOST ENZYMES DUE TO THEIR TIGHTLY PACKED SEMI-CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. TO BREAK DOWN AND UTILIZE RESISTANT STARCH AS A NUTRIENT SOURCE, A BACTERIUM MUST ENCODE PROTEINS THAT BIND TO THE STARCH GRANULE COMPONENTS AND HYDROLYZE GLYCOSIDIC LINKAGES. STARCH- SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE BINDING MODULES (CBMS) ARE COMMONLY APPENDED TO GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASE FAMILY 13 (GH13) DOMAINS, WHICH HYDROLYZE THE GLUCOSE LINKAGES IN STARCH. B.

CURRENT PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES TO COMBAT GIO ARE EFFECTIVE, HOWEVER THEY CARRY SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECT PROFILES AND ARE COSTLY, LEADING TO HISTORICALLY POOR ADHERENCE RATES. THUS, DISCOVERY OF NOVEL THERAPEUTICS THAT ARE COST EFFECTIVE AND CARRY FEW SIDE EFFECTS ARE BOTH DESIRABLE AND NECESSARY. THE GUT MICROBIOTA IS KNOWN TO PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN BOTH THE PATHOGENESIS AND PREVENTION OF GIO AND OUR LAB AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE GUT MICROBIOTA IS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR PROMOTING BONE HEALTH. PRUNES ARE THE DRIED FORM OF A NATURAL FRUIT, PLUMS, AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BENEFIT BONE HEALTH IN BOTH PRE-CLINICAL AND HUMAN MODELS OF PRIMARY OSTEOPOROSIS, ALTHOUGH THEIR MECHANISM IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. IN PRELIMINARY STUDIES, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT PRUNES PREVENT GIO IN MICE. PRUNES SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE COMPOSITION OF GUT MICROBIOTA AND ARE ALSO EXTENSIVELY METABOLIZED BY THE GUT MICROBIOTA. ADDITIONALLY, PRUNES ARE RICH IN TRYPTOPHAN WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN BONE HEALTH. IN ADDITIONAL STUDIES, WE FOUND THAT MICROBIALLY DERIVED TRYPTOPHAN METABOLITES IN THE SERUM POSITIVELY CORRELATE WITH BONE VOLUME. TO DATE, PRUNES AND THEIR MICROBIALLY DERIVED METABOLITES HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED IN THE CONTEXT OF GIO PREVENTION. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ESTABLISH THE MECHANISTIC BASIS BY WHICH PRUNE INDUCED CHANGES IN THE GUT MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION AND CORRESPONDINGLY ITS TRYPTOPHAN METABOLITES PREVENT GIO.

TO ESTABLISH TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE, SUB AIM 1B WILL INVESTIGATE IF PRUNES EFFECT ON THE HUMAN MICROBIOTA ARE TRANSFERABLE TO MICE (HUMAN A MOUSE FECAL TRANSPLANT) AND IMPROVE BONE HEALTH. AIM 2 WILL DEMONSTRATE IF MICROBIALLY DERIVED TRYPTOPHAN METABOLITES FROM PRUNES CAN INDEPENDENTLY IMPROVE BONE DENSITY AND PREVENT GIO. SUB AIM 2A WILL INVESTIGATE TRYPTOPHAN METABOLITES EFFECT ON PREVENTING OSTEOBLAST APOPTOSIS AND GIO USING AN IN VIVO MODEL WHILE SUB AIM 2B WILL FURTHER INVESTIGATE THEIR MECHANISMS IN VITRO.

IN THE FACE OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC, THE NEED FOR BETTER SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEURO- AND PSYCHO-BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF CHRONIC PAIN TO GUIDE IMPROVED TREATMENT APPROACHES IS CLEAR. NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS, INCLUDING CONTEMPLATIVE AND INTEGRATIVE PRACTICES, HAVE SHOWN EFFICACY IN IMPROVING PAIN AND BOLSTER EFFORTS TO REDUCE OPIOID-ERGIC MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. THESE INTERVENTIONS OFTEN TARGET THE PROCESSING OF INTERNAL PAINFUL AND NON-PAINFUL SENSORY SIGNALS, REFERRED TO AS INTEROCEPTION. NEURAL PROCESSING OF INTEROCEPTIVE STIMULI OVERLAPS WITH MANY OF THE REGIONS ALTERED IN CHRONIC PAIN, AND SELF-REPORT INTEROCEPTIVE QUESTIONNAIRES AND TASKS SHOW DIMINISHED INTEROCEPTIVE PERFORMANCE IN PAIN PATIENTS. HOWEVER, THE TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE OF INTEROCEPTIVE FUNCTIONING IN PAIN TREATMENT TRAJECTORIES HAS BEEN HINDERED BY THE LACK OF CLEAR TASKS AND QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURES OF INTEROCEPTION. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH WHETHER NEURAL PROCESSING OF NON-PAINFUL INTEROCEPTIVE STIMULI, NAMELY THE HEARTBEAT, IS ALTERED IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS AT VARIOUS STAGES OF TREATMENT AND PREDICTIVE OF NON-RESPONSE TO INVASIVE PERIPHERALLY-TARGETED TREATMENTS COMPARED TO HEALTHY ADULTS. THIS NRSA PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY HOW ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS (EEG/ECG) ARE RELATED TO INTEROCEPTIVE PROCESSES AND PAIN TREATMENT RESPONSE USING TWO NEWLY DEVELOPED, VALIDATED, AND RIGOROUSLY CONTROLLED INTEROCEPTION TASKS THAT ASSESS NEURAL RESPONSES TO THE HEART (HEARTBEAT-EVOKED POTENTIAL, HEP). I WILL SYSTEMATICALLY TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS WILL DISPLAY DIMINISHED MODULATION OF THE HEP DURING ATTENTION TO THEIR HEARTBEAT COMPARED TO HEALTHY CONTROLS (AIM 1) AND IMPAIRED INTEROCEPTIVE-EXTEROCEPTIVE INTEGRATION WHEN AN EXTEROCEPTIVE TONE PREVIOUSLY SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE HEARTBEAT IS UNEXPECTEDLY OMITTED (AIM 2). I WILL ALSO TEST THAT THESE MEASURES AT BASELINE CAN PREDICT NON-RESPONSE TO PAIN INTERVENTION. TOGETHER, THESE DATA WILL ESTABLISH WHETHER NEURAL MARKERS OF NON-PAINFUL INTEROCEPTIVE PROCESSING COULD BE CLINICALLY RELEVANT BIOMARKERS FOR GUIDING TREATMENT SELECTION IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, AND WOULD HAVE BROAD IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INCORPORATION OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS TARGETING INTEROCEPTIVE PROCESSING.

ABSTRACT THE INFORMATION FLOW BETWEEN THE PERIPHERAL ORGANS AND THE BRAIN IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS BIDIRECTIONAL, WITH ACTIVITY IN PERIPHERAL CIRCUITS INFLUENCING HIGH-LEVEL BEHAVIORS INCLUDING MOOD, MOTIVATION, AND STRESS. TO ESTABLISH MECHANISTIC LINKS BETWEEN ACTIVITY OF PERIPHERAL NEURONS AND BRAIN CIRCUITS, WE WILL DEVELOP A SPECIES- AGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK FOR TARGETING AND REMOTE MODULATION OF SPECIFIC CELLS WITHIN THE PERIPHERAL ORGANS AND THE BRAIN DURING BEHAVIOR. OUR FRAMEWORK WILL COMBINE THE HOMING, MODULATION, AND CONTRAST PROPERTIES OF SYNTHETIC MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS WITH THE TARGETING SPECIFICITY OF VIRAL VECTORS. MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS HAVE RECENTLY EMERGED AS VERSATILE TRANSDUCERS OF REMOTELY APPLIED WEAK MAGNETIC FIELDS INTO THERMAL, CHEMICAL, OR MECHANICAL STIMULI PERCEIVED BY ION CHANNELS. WE WILL DRAMATICALLY EXPAND THE PALETTE OF MAGNETIC NANOTRANSDUCERS TO ENABLE RECEPTOR-SPECIFIC REMOTE MAGNETIC MODULATION OF NEURONS (OR OTHER ELECTROGENIC CELLS) ANYWHERE IN THE BODY DURING FREE BEHAVIOR. MOREOVER, WE WILL LEVERAGE RECENT ADVANCES IN ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRAL VECTORS FOR TARGETING SPECIFIC CELLS AND TISSUES BY CREATING AN ARRAY OF FUSIONS OF NANOTRANSDUCERS AND VIRAL CAPSIDS. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR MAGNETIC GUIDANCE AND LOCALIZATION OF THE HYBRID MAGNETIC- VIRAL FUSIONS TO THE LOCATIONS OF INTEREST FOLLOWING SYSTEMIC DELIVERY REGARDLESS OF THE MODEL ORGANISM. WE WILL APPLY OUR FRAMEWORK TO ELUCIDATE CIRCUITS CONNECTING THE ENTERIC (GUT) NERVOUS SYSTEM TO THE MIDBRAIN STRUCTURES. RECENT WORK HAS DRAWN LINKS BETWEEN GASTROINTESTINAL DYSFUNCTION AND SOCIAL AND MOOD DISORDERS AS WELL AS DEMONSTRATED VAGAL TRANSMISSION OF THE ENTERIC SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN. BY APPLYING RECEPTOR-SPECIFIC MODULATION TO THE ENTERIC NEURONS WE INTEND TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THEIR ACTIVITY INFLUENCES MIDBRAIN PATHWAYS GOVERNING REWARD AND MOTIVATION, AND POSSIBLY MOTOR BEHAVIORS.

EVEN A SIMPLE MOVEMENT, LIKE EXTENDING THE ARM, REQUIRES THE ACTIVATION OF MANY NEURONAL POPULATIONS ACROSS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. OUR LAB HAS USED A COMBINATION OF ANATOMICAL, GENETIC, OPTICAL AND BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES TO UNRAVEL HOW ANIMALS MOVE, AND LEARN TO CONTROL MOVEMENT. HOWEVER, ADAPTIVE RESPONSES ARE NOT EFFECTED ONLY THROUGH MUSCLES, BUT ALSO THROUGH OTHER ORGANS. FOR EXAMPLE, PLANNING TO PICK AN APPLE WILL TRIGGER NOT ONLY MUSCLE ACTIVITY BUT ALSO THE EXPECTATION OF FOOD, AND THE CONDITIONED RELEASE OF INSULIN. HENCE ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR REQUIRES THE COORDINATION OF AN ORGANISM'S ACTIONS WITH ITS PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERNAL STATES. WE PROPOSE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXPERTISE TO DISSECT THE NEURAL CIRCUITS AND PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE LEARNING AND ADAPTIVE \u201cMOTOR\u201d CONTROL OF INTERNAL ORGAN FUNCTION. WE WILL SPEARHEAD THIS NEW RESEARCH DIRECTION BY INVESTIGATING CONDITIONED INSULIN RELEASE AND CONDITIONED IMMUNOSUPPRESSION, MEDIATED BY THE INNERVATION OF THE PANCREAS AND SPLEEN, RESPECTIVELY. WE WILL LEVERAGE STATE OF THE ART VIRAL AND RNA-SEQ APPROACHES TO MAP WITH HIGH-RESOLUTION THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD-ORDER INNERVATION OF SPLEEN AND PANCREAS. OUR PRELIMINARY ANATOMICAL MAPPING OF THE INNERVATION OF THESE ORGANS REVEALED THAT DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF CELIAC-MESENTERIC GANGLIA SYMPATHETIC NEURONS INNERVATE PANCREAS VERSUS SPLEEN. REMARKABLY, MOST INNERVATION OF THE THORACIC PREGANGLIONIC SPINAL CORD TARGETING THESE ORGANS EMERGES FROM THE CORTEX: MOTOR CORTEX, BUT ALSO SENSORY AND PREFRONTAL. WE THEREFORE HYPOTHESIZE THAT LEARNING TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES IN INTERNAL ORGANS AFTER CONDITIONING IS MEDIATED BY HIGHER-ORDER BRAIN CIRCUITS, AND FOLLOWS PRINCIPLES SIMILAR TO THOSE USED FOR MOTOR RESPONSES. WE PROPOSE TO USE BOTH TARGETED AND UNBIASED APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY AND MANIPULATE THE ACTIVITY OF DESCENDING NEURAL POPULATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LEARNED CONTROL OF SPLEEN AND PANCREATIC FUNCTION. THIS NEW LINE OF RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE BUT TRACKABLE WITH OUR EXPERTISE, AND THE PIONEER AWARD SUPPORT WILL HELP US ATTACK THIS NOVEL RESEARCH AREA.
