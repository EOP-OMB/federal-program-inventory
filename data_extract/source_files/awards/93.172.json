THIS DIVERSITY OF VARIANTS, REGULATORY ELEMENTS, AND CELL TYPES INDICATES THAT MULTIPLE MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTE TO DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS. ONE KEY CHALLENGE TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE MECHANISMS IS THAT THE MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND FUNCTIONAL PHENOTYPES OF EACH VARIANT REMAIN LARGELY UNCHARACTERIZED. UNTIL THESE CRITICAL GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE ARE ADDRESSED, THE UNDERLYING MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR DETERMINANTS OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY WILL REMAIN INCOMPLETE.

TO BUILD A GENERALIZABLE FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF HUMAN GENETIC VARIATION ON FUNCTION, WE PROPOSE A HIGH THROUGHPUT PERTURBATION PLATFORM WITH THREE PRIMARY GOALS: (1) CONTRIBUTE TO A VARIANT/ELEMENT/PHENOTYPE CATALOG WITH RELEVANCE TO DISEASES OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, FOCUSING ON ELEMENTS GENETICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE (CARDIOMYOCYTES), AUTISM (NEURONS), AND PLACENTAL DEFECTS (TROPHOBLASTS); (2) CONTRIBUTE TO A VARIANT/ELEMENT/PHENOTYPE CATALOG FOR NON-CANONICAL HUMAN GENETICS, FOCUSING ON TWO UNDERSTUDIED TOPICS IN HUMAN GENETICS: PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS AND NON-CELL AUTONOMOUS EFFECTS; AND (3) CONTRIBUTE TO A VARIANT/ELEMENT/PHENOTYPE CATALOG WITH RELEVANCE TO MECHANISMS OF GENE REGULATION, FOCUSING ON ENHANCER RNAS.

THE RESOURCE WILL FACILITATE INTERPRETATION OF NONCODING GENETIC VARIATION ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN TRAITS AND DISEASES, ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE MECHANISMS AND HASTEN PROGRESS TOWARDS GENOMIC MEDICINE.  A LARGE MAJORITY OF GENETIC VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN DISEASES ARE NON-CODING, WHICH HAS HINDERED THEIR INTERPRETATION AND UTILITY FOR UNDERSTANDING DISEASE. NON-CODING DISEASE VARIANTS ARE ENRICHED WITHIN PROMOTERS, ENHANCERS AND TF BINDING SITES. HENCE, A COMPELLING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THEY MODULATE THE ACTIVITY OF FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS, TF INTERACTIONS AND GENE TARGETS IN SPECIFIC CELLULAR CONTEXTS. TO INTERPRET THE FUNCTION OF A VARIANT, INVESTIGATORS MUST DETERMINE THE ELEMENT AND/OR TF THAT THEY IMPACT, WHICH GENE IS AFFECTED, AND THE CELL STATE IN WHICH THE EFFECT IS MANIFESTED.

A MAJORITY OF CAUSAL VARIANTS LIE IN THE NONCODING GENOME AND APPEAR TO AFFECT DNA CIS-REGULATORY ELEMENTS, WHICH CONTROL THE LOGIC OF GENE EXPRESSION AND COULD POINT US TO NEW CELL TYPES, GENES, AND PATHWAYS FOR DISEASE. HOWEVER, WE HAVE LACKED THE TOOLS NEEDED TO SYSTEMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE HOW THESE CIS-REGULATORY VARIANTS AND ELEMENTS IMPACT GENOME FUNCTION AND PHENOTYPE.

VARIANTS OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE CANNOT BE USED TO GUIDE PATIENT CARE AND REFLECT OUR INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF VARIANT EFFECTS. TO OVERCOME THIS CHALLENGE, WE DEVELOPED SATURATION GENOME EDITING (SGE) AND VARIANT ABUNDANCE BY MASSIVELY PARALLEL SEQUENCING (VAMP-SEQ), MULTIPLEXED ASSAYS OF VARIANT EFFECT THAT CAN MAKE AND MEASURE THE FUNCTIONAL EFFECT OF MASSIVE NUMBERS OF VARIANTS.

VAMP-SEQ MEASURES THE EFFECTS OF MISSENSE VARIANTS ON PROTEIN ABUNDANCE INSIDE CELLS, AND CAN IDENTIFY UP TO 80% OF PATHOGENIC VARIANTS.

A STRONG FEATURE OF AACC-NY IS OUR CAPACITY TO TARGET OFTEN-MARGINALIZED, LOW- INCOME, NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES IN THE NY AREA, WHO MOST OFTEN EXPERIENCE SOCIAL AND HEALTH DISPARITIES AND WHO ARE OFTEN UNDER-REPRESENTED IN EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH. THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA IS HOME TO THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE ASA POPULATION OF ANY URBAN REGION IN THE US, COMPRISING 3.2 MILLION RESIDENTS, OF WHICH ~40% ARE KOREAN OR CHINESE AMERICAN. IN THE LONGER TERM, CVD AND OTHER METABOLIC DISEASES SUCH AS TYPE II DIABETES WILL BE OUR PRIORITY; HOWEVER, THE COHORT ALSO SUPPORTS AIMS RELATED TO BROAD HEALTH OUTCOMES, PARTICULARLY THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITHIN THE OVERALL NATIONAL COHORT FRAMEWORK. IN THIS FUNDING PERIOD, LEVERAGING OUR EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG COMMUNITY OUTREACH, ENGAGEMENT, AND COMMUNITY BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH PROGRAMS WITH ASA COMMUNITIES, IN AIM 1 WE WILL ENROLL A COHORT OF 3200 ASA (AGE 25\u201364 YEARS, INCLUDING 1600 KOREAN AND 1600 CHINESE) AND CONDUCT PARTICIPANT FOLLOW UP AND SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ASCERTAINMENT OF EVENTS OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. IN AIM 2 WE WILL COMPLETE BASELINE EXAM, INCLUDING QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY, PHYSICAL EXAM, SUBCLINICAL MEASURE OF CVD, AND BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION. IN AIM 3, WE WILL COMPLETE DATA HARMONIZATION AND SHARING WITH OTHER CLINICAL/COMMUNITY FIELD AND COORDINATING CENTERS. AIM 4 WILL FOCUS ON SHORT-TERM RESEARCH STUDIES TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOCIOCULTURAL, DIET/EXERCISE, ENVIRONMENT, AND BIOLOGICAL (GENETICS, MICROBIOME) FACTORS IN RELATION TO SUBCLINICAL MARKERS FOR CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASE IN OVERALL AND KOREAN AND CHINESE ETHNIC SUBGROUPS. THE AACC IS A UNIQUE URBAN PLATFORM WITH INTEGRATED COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION TO ADDRESS PRIORITY KNOWLEDGE GAPS REGARDING CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND ITS DISPARITIES IN SPECIFIC ASA SUBPOPULATIONS. THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES IN ASA COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING THE OFTEN MARGINALIZED AND UNDERSERVED.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c07787b9-15d4-d1eb-4f0c-2e0b30320bfb-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UG3HL169656_7529"}, {"internal_id": 162139835, "Award ID": "UG3HL169648", "Award Amount": 576471.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-08-04", "CFDA Number": "93.837", "Description": "ASIAN AMERICAN PREVENTION RESEARCH: A POPULOMICS EPIDEMIOLOGY COHORT (ARISE) - PROJECT SUMMARY WE PROPOSE TO CONTRIBUTE A BAY AREA, POPULATION-BASED PROSPECTIVE COHORT TO A NATIONWIDE COHORT STUDY OF ASIAN AMERICAN (ASA) MEN AND WOMEN TO ADDRESS MAJOR GAPS IN EVIDENCE ON THE CORRELATES AND DETERMINANTS OF DISEASE RISK AND HEALTH. WE WILL RECRUIT, CHARACTERIZE, AND FOLLOW CHINESE, FILIPINO, AND VIETNAMESE AMERICANS, THREE UNDERSTUDIED ASA ETHNIC GROUPS WHOSE POPULATIONS ARE RAPIDLY EXPANDING IN THE UNITED STATES. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL RECRUIT 2,100 CHINESE, FILIPINO, AND VIETNAMESE AMERICANS (700 OF EACH ETHNIC GROUP) IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA TO CHARACTERIZE CARDIOMETABOLIC PROFILES AND PSYCHOSOCIAL AND OTHER HEALTH FACTORS THROUGH EXTENSIVE SURVEYS, CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS AND ASSAYS, IMAGING STUDIES, MULTI-OMICS, AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH DISEASE PATTERNS AND RISK FACTORS APPEAR TO VARY AMONG DIFFERENT ASA GROUPS, PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT ASAS ARE HIGHLY AFFECTED BY CARDIOMETABOLIC DISORDERS SUCH AS DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, DYSLIPIDEMIA, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, STROKE, NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE, AND OBESITY, AS WELL AS UNDERDIAGNOSED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES RELATED TO IMMIGRATION TRAUMA, DISCRIMINATION, AND MARGINALIZATION. HOWEVER, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA ON INDIVIDUAL ASA GROUPS ARE SPARSE, AND MOST CLINICAL GUIDELINES AND TREATMENTS ARE BASED ON DATA DERIVED FROM CAUCASIANS. OUR UG3/UH3 STUDY SITE WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE COORDINATING CENTER (U24), OTHER STUDY SITES, AND NHLBI TO DEVELOP A LARGE COHORT OF 10,000 MEMBERS TO CHARACTERIZE RISK FACTORS AND DISEASE PATTERNS IN INDIVIDUAL ASA ETHNIC GROUPS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE PROPOSED STUDY ARE TO 1) CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMON PROTOCOL FOR THE STUDY IN COLLABORATION WITH NHLBI, U24, AND OTHER UG3/UH3 INVESTIGATORS AND ESTABLISH A STATE-OF-THE-ART POPULOMICS COHORT; 2) MEASURE THE PREVALENCE OR DISTRIBUTION OF BASELINE SELF-REPORTED HEALTH AND RISK FACTORS AND CLINICAL MARKERS IN EACH ETHNIC GROUP AND COMPARE ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS; AND 3) DETERMINE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG BASELINE RISK FACTORS IN EACH ASA ETHNIC GROUP, INCLUDING SELF-REPORTED STRESS AND SLEEP AS WELL AS HEART RATE VARIABILITY-DERIVED SLEEP QUALITY AND STRESS FROM WEARABLE BIOSENSING DATA, WITH SUBSEQUENT (INCIDENT) HEALTH OUTCOMES DURING FOLLOW-UP. THIS PROPOSED STUDY IS INNOVATIVE IN ITS IN-DEPTH EXPOSOME PHENOTYPING THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE SURVEYS THAT WILL INCLUDE ASSESSMENTS OF WELL-BEING AND ANXIETY IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL RISK FACTORS, BASELINE CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS, ADVANCED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY, AND INTEGRATIVE OMICS TO UNDERSTAND THE INTERSECTIONS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, BIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, AND TECHNOLOGY IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. WE WILL LEVERAGE THESE INNOVATIONS ALONGSIDE STANFORD\u2019S WORLD-CLASS RESOURCES IN POPULATION HEALTH SCIENCES TO UNCOVER CRITICAL CARDIOMETABOLIC AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS UNDERLYING HEALTH AND DISEASE IN ASAS.

THUS, IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, COMPREHENSIVE ATLASES OF REGULATORY ELEMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL. MANY PREVIOUS EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN EPIGENOME CONSORTIUM (IHEC), THE FANTOM CONSORTIUM, THE ROADMAP EPIGENOMICS PROJECT, AND THE ENCODE PROJECT, HAVE AIMED TO BUILD COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTIONS OF REGULATORY ELEMENTS, AS WELL AS COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO BETTER PREDICT REGULATORY ACTIVITY AND UNDERSTAND THE SEQUENCE FEATURES UNDERLYING REGULATORY FUNCTION. ENCODE (2003-2022) IS A LARGE- SCALE CONSORTIUM EFFORT WHICH AIMS TO ANNOTATE EVERY FUNCTIONAL NON-CODING ELEMENT OF THE HUMAN GENOME; DURING OUR WORK ON THE PROJECT, WE BUILT A REGISTRY OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION HUMAN CANDIDATE CIS-REGULATORY ELEMENTS (CCRES).

DOCKSTORE, PREVIOUSLY FUNDED BY AN R01 FROM NHGRI GRANT, HAS GROWN TREMENDOUSLY OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. IT NOW HAS THOUSANDS OF USERS, HOSTS HUNDREDS OF TOOLS AND WORKFLOWS, AND IS USED AS THE METHODS FOR MULTIPLE MAJOR PLATFORMS AND PROJECTS. THOUGH NOT TECHNICALLY A RENEWAL, THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE THE CORE FUNDING TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF DOCKSTORE, WHICH IS A FULLY OPEN SOURCE PLATFORM ENTIRELY RELIANT ON GRANT FUNDING.  THIS PROPOSAL WOULD GROW DOCKSTORE AS A RESOURCE TO MAKE IT A HUB FOR BROADLY SHARING COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE. THE AIMS OF THE PROPOSAL COVER FOUNDATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT (AIM 1), SUPPORT FOR SHARING NEW, POPULAR CONTENT TYPES (AIM 2), THE EXPANSION OF PUBLISHING FEATURES TO MAKE DOCKSTORE MORE BROADLY USEFUL (AIM 3), AND A STRONG FOCUS ON TRAINING AND OUTREACH (AIM 4). THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT OF AIM 1 WILL INCREASE THE SCALING AND ROBUSTNESS OF DOCKSTORE AND SUPPORT DOCKSTORE AS A SECURE, COMPLIANT RESOURCE, ENABLING IT TO SAFELY HOST PRE-PUBLICATION TOOLS AND WORKFLOWS WORKING WITH MANAGED ACCESS DATASETS. IT WILL INTEGRATE DOCKSTORE MORE DEEPLY WITH SECURE CLOUD PLATFORMS, SUCH AS THE NHGRI ANVIL. THE EXPANSION OF CONTENT TYPES BY AIM 2 WILL, FOR EXAMPLE, MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PUBLISH PROGRAMMING NOTEBOOKS ON DOCKSTORE. SUCH ARTIFACTS ARE WIDELY USED BUT NOT YET ROBUSTLY SEARCHABLE BY ANY SCIENTIFIC RESOURCE. AIM 3 WILL BRING ORCID INTEGRATION, ALLOWING USERS TO AUTHENTICATE THEMSELVES AND THEN SIGN AND ENDORSE THEIR WORK, AND TO PROVIDE OPEN PEER REVIEW OF PUBLISHED TOOLS. AIM 4 WILL FOCUS ON GROWING AND EDUCATING THE USER BASE VIA AN EXPANSION OF ONLINE TRAINING MATERIAL, WEBINARS, IN PERSON WORKSHOPS AND COLLABORATIONS WITH TRAINING FOR PARTNER PROJECTS USING DOCKSTORE.

WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING AIMS TO MEET THESE GOALS: 1) FACILITATE COLLABORATIONS ACROSS THE GENOME TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM AND PROMOTE STANDARDS THAT AID IN ACHIEVING PROGRAM GOALS. WE WILL HOST AND SUPPORT ANNUAL MEETINGS FOR THE GENOME TECHNOLOGY AND CEGS PROGRAMS. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP WORKING GROUPS AMONG GRANTEES TO PROMOTE COLLABORATION-BUILDING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF METRICS AND STANDARDS FOR GENOMIC TECHNOLOGIES.

WE ARGUE THAT TWO GAPS EXIST IN THE CURRENT RESOURCES THAT AGGREGATE THESE DATA: FIRST, NO CURRENT RESOURCE AIMS TO COMPREHENSIVELY CURATE AND CATALOG ALL THAT IS KNOWN, AND ALL DATA OR METHODS THAT COULD HELP PREDICT, THE FUNCTIONAL EFFECTS OF GWAS ASSOCIATIONS; SECOND, EXISTING RESOURCES ARE DEVELOPED WITH (AT BEST) LIMITED INVOLVEMENT FROM EXPERTS WHO EITHER ORIGINALLY GENERATED THE GENOMIC DATA AND/OR UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST USE THEM.

ALTHOUGH AT LEAST ONE RELIABLE FULL-LENGTH TRANSCRIPT MODEL HAS BEEN ASSIGNED FOR EVERY PROTEIN-CODING GENE, THE MAJORITY OF ALTERNATIVE ISOFORMS REMAINS UNCHARACTERIZED DUE TO I) VAST DIFFERENCES OF EXPRESSION LEVELS BETWEEN ISOFORMS EXPRESSED FROM COMMON GENES, AND II) THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING FULL-LENGTH (FL) TRANSCRIPT SEQUENCES. FURTHERMORE, THERE REMAINS A LARGE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TRANSCRIPTS IN ANNOTATION DATABASES AND THE NUMBER FOR WHICH THERE IS AN ANNOTATED FL TRANSCRIPT WITH EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE. THE SPECTRUM OF ENCODED TRANSCRIPTS COMPRISES A VAST BUT FINITE \u201cISOFORM-SPACE\u201d WITH MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS: I) GENES, II) TISSUES AND CELL TYPES, III) DEVELOPMENT AND TIME IV) DISEASE, AND V) RESPONSE TO STIMULI. JUST AS EXPRESSION LEVELS VARY ACROSS CELLS AND TISSUES, SO CAN THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF ALTERNATIVELY SPLICED TRANSCRIPTS. FULL, FUNCTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN GENOME WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE AND COMPLETE ANNOTATION OF THE ENTIRE COMPLEMENT OF ENCODED FUNCTIONAL PROTEINS. HISTORICALLY, GENE ANNOTATION WAS SUPPORTED PREDOMINANTLY BY ESTS AND MRNAS FROM INSDC DATABASES WHILE AUTOMATED APPROACHES TO ANNOTATION ARE BEING APPLIED TO WHOLE GENOMES AND TRANSCRIPTOMES. HOWEVER, CURRENT AUTOMATED ANNOTATION DOES NOT PROVIDE THE SAME QUALITY DATA AS DOES MANUAL ANNOTATION. SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY ARE REDUCED, LESS FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION IS CAPTURED, AND ALL AUTOMATED METHODS LACK THE CAPACITY OF A MANUAL ANNOTATOR TO INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL ORTHOGONAL DATA TYPES AND INTERPRETATION OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, BUT MANUAL ANNOTATION IS HIGHLY LABOR-INTENSIVE. GENCODE RELEASE V36 REPRESENTS THE INTERPRETATION OF NEARLY 10 MILLION EST, CDNA AND PROTEIN HOMOLOGIES. GIVEN THE ANTICIPATED VOLUMES OF DATA, WITH SINGLE EXPERIMENTS PRODUCING MORE DATA THAN THE ENTIRE INSDC CATALOGUE, CURRENT METHODS OF MANUAL ANNOTATION DO NOT SCALE. THE EMERGENCE OF LONG TRANSCRIPTOMIC SEQUENCING METHODS PROVIDES FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF HISTORICAL DATA TYPES TO THE BENEFIT OF GENE AND TRANSCRIPT ANNOTATION. HOWEVER, THE MASSIVELY GREATER DATA VOLUMES ALREADY BEING DEPOSITED IN PUBLIC DATA ARCHIVES EXCEED MANUAL CURATION CAPABILITY, DEMANDING IMPLEMENTATION OF AUTOMATED SOLUTIONS WITHOUT COMPROMISING ANNOTATION QUALITY. FURTHERMORE, AS UNTARGETED SEQUENCING APPROACHES ARE VERY INEFFICIENT IN THEIR DISCOVERY OF LESS ABUNDANT TRANSCRIPTS, THE MAJORITY OF SEQUENCE DATA GENERATED GIVES US VERY LITTLE INSIGHT INTO DISCOVERABLE TRANSCRIPT DIVERSITY.

GENCODE WILL MAINTAIN A MAJOR FOCUS ON PROTEIN-CODING AND NON-CODING LOCI, INCLUDING THEIR ALTERNATIVELY SPLICED ISOFORMS AND PSEUDOGENES AND WILL EXTEND EXPERT MANUAL REVIEW TO SMALL NON-CODING RNAS (NCRNA) AND THE ANNOTATION OF NON-POLYADENYLATED TRANSCRIPTS. GENCODE WILL ALSO EXPAND REGULATORY ANNOTATION TO A DEFINED SET OF GENE-ASSOCIATED FEATURES TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN REGULATORY REGIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH TRANSCRIBED SEQUENCES SUCH AS NCRNA, AND OVERALL TRANSCRIPTIONAL OUTPUT. GENCODE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INCREASING MATURITY OF GENOMICS TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING LONG-READ TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING, FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS ASSAYS, AND GRAPH- BASED GENOME REPRESENTATIONS TO IDENTIFY FEATURES SUCH AS GENES, PSEUDOGENES, EXONS AND SPLICE SITES THAT ARE INCORRECT, INCOMPLETE OR IN GENOME REGIONS SIMPLY NOT PRESENT IN THE CURRENT REFERENCE ASSEMBLY. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS GENCODE PLANS TO 1) EXTEND ITS HUMAN AND MOUSE GENE SETS TO AS NEAR COMPLETION AS POSSIBLE GIVEN AVAILABLE DATA AND CURRENT EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGY; 2) LEVERAGE NEW, HIGH-QUALITY HUMAN GENOME ASSEMBLIES AND TARGETED TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATA TO EXPAND REPRESENTATION SO THAT MORE HUMAN HAPLOTYPES WILL HAVE HIGH-QUALITY ANNOTATION 3) ANNOTATE GENE-ASSOCIATED REGULATORY REGIONS INCLUDING ENHANCER- PROMOTER CONNECTIONS 4) COLLABORATE WITH OTHER RESOURCES TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT REPRESENTATION OF GENIC AND REGULATORY FEATURES AND REFERENCE TRANSCRIPTS FOR REPORTING CLINICAL VARIATION; AND 5) DISTRIBUTE GENCODE ANNOTATIONS AND ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITY ANNOTATION EFFORTS TO ENSURE ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY.

WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES SUBMITTING LINKED U24 GRANT PROPOSALS (BAYLOR/STANFORD; UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA/KAISER), AS OUR WORK IS HIGHLY INTEGRATED AND SYNERGISTIC FOR ACHIEVING OUR SHARED GOALS, WHICH ARE EMBODIED BY OUR SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT STANDARDS TO SUPPORT CLINICAL ANNOTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF GENES AND VARIANTS; 2) SHARE GENOMIC AND PHENOTYPIC DATA BETWEEN CLINICIANS, RESEARCHERS, AND PATIENTS THROUGH ENHANCED KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR CLINICAL AND RESEARCH USE; 3) ENHANCE AND ACCELERATE EXPERT REVIEW OF THE CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF GENES AND VARIANTS; AND 4) DISSEMINATE AND INTEGRATE CLINGEN KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCES TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY. CLINGEN\u2019S APPROACH TO PROVIDING CURATED CLINICAL GENOMIC RESOURCES TO AID THE INTERPRETATION OF INDIVIDUAL GENOMES INVOLVES CURATING GENES TO UNDERSTAND WHICH HAVE BEEN VALIDLY IMPLICATED IN DISEASE (AND THROUGH WHAT MUTATIONAL MECHANISMS), AND CURATING VARIANTS (AND THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING CLAIMS OF PATHOGENICITY) TO IDENTIFY WHICH ARE CAUSAL FOR EXISTING DISEASE OR PREDICTIVE OF RISK FOR FUTURE DISEASE. TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS, WE HAVE ORGANIZED GENE AND VARIANT CURATION EXPERT PANELS BY CLINICAL DOMAINS TO CURATE CLAIMS OF GENE-DISEASE ASSOCIATION AND VARIANT PATHOGENICITY. IN ADDITION, WE CURATE THE DOSAGE SENSITIVITY FOR EACH GENE TO AID IN THE INTERPRETATION OF STRUCTURAL VARIANTS, AS WELL AS THE ACTIONABILITY OF GENE-DISEASE PAIRS TO GUIDE THE USE OF THIS INFORMATION FOR DETERMINING DISEASE RISK. TO SUPPORT VARIANT INTERPRETATION, WE DEVELOP STANDARDS TO ENABLE THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY TO CLASSIFY VARIANTS WITH THE SAME RIGOROUS STANDARDS AS CLINGEN. WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE GLOBAL DATA SHARING OF GENOMIC KNOWLEDGE THROUGH OUR SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP WITH CLINVAR, THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATION\u2019S REPOSITORY FOR GENOMIC VARIANTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO HUMAN HEALTH, AS WELL AS THROUGH DIRECT DATA SHARING FROM PATIENTS VIA GENOME CONNECT, CLINGEN\u2019S PATIENT REGISTRY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SOLICIT AND SUPPORT CLINVAR SUBMISSIONS, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON GLOBAL AND DIVERSE DATA SOURCES, ALLOWING TRANSPARENCY, COMPARISON OF RESULTS, AND CROWDSOURCING VARIANT CLASSIFICATION.

FIRST, THE POLYGENIC INHERITANCE INFLUENCING MOST CONDITIONS REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A VAST NUMBER OF GENES AND REGULATORY ELEMENTS. THIS TASK IS CHALLENGED BY THE COMPLEXITY OF GENE REGULATION, WHERE 3D REGULATORY INTERACTIONS CAN LINK ENHANCERS AND GENES OVER LARGE GENOMIC DISTANCES. SECOND, MULTIPLE INTERACTING CELL TYPES ARE OFTEN DYSREGULATED IN DISEASE PATHOLOGY. THIS NECESSITATES AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE COLLECTIVE VARIANTS ASSOCIATING WITH A DISEASE AFFECT EACH CELL TYPE INVOLVED IN THE DISEASE PROCESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY HOW THESE DYSREGULATED CELLULAR PHENOTYPES CROSSREGULATE AND DRIVE SUBSEQUENT CELLULAR STATES.

THE REMARKABLE ABILITY OF OSKM TO REPROGRAM DIVERSE SOMATIC CELL TYPES INTO IPSCS THAT ARE FUNCTIONALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS INDICATES THAT OSKM LEVERAGES A FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISM FOR NETWORK REMODELING THAT MAY BE GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL CELL FATE TRANSITIONS.

HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC GENOMIC PROGRAMS THAT DRIVE SIGNAL- INDUCED STATE CHANGES IN BETA CELLS REMAIN POORLY CHARACTERIZED. RECENT ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL (HPSC)-DERIVED MULTI-CELLULAR ISLET ORGANOID MODELS BY US AND OTHERS PROVIDE A GENETICALLY TRACTABLE BETA CELL MODEL FOR LINKING GENOMIC ACTIVITY TO CELLULAR PHENOTYPES. OUR GROUP HAS FURTHER PIONEERED THE DEVELOPMENT OF NUMEROUS SINGLE CELL ASSAYS, INCLUDING CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY, ULTRA-HIGH-THROUGHPUT PAIRED CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY AND GENE EXPRESSION, AND PAIRED 3D CHROMATIN INTERACTIONS AND DNA METHYLATION; METHODS THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO BOTH PRIMARY HUMAN ISLETS AND HPSC-ISLET ORGANOIDS. WE HAVE FURTHER DEVELOPED MACHINE LEARNING AND NETWORK-BASED APPROACHES FOR VARIANT INTERPRETATION INCLUDING FROM SINGLE CELL RNA AND EPIGENETIC DATA. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL DEVELOP NOVEL GENE REGULATORY NETWORK (GRN) MODELS TO PREDICT NETWORK-LEVEL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG GENOMIC ELEMENTS, GENES, AND PHENOTYPES DERIVED FROM SINGLE CELL MULTIOMIC MAPS CHARTING SIGNAL- AND TIME-DEPENDENT CHANGES IN HPSC-ISLET ORGANOIDS. IN SECTIONS B AND C WE WILL MEASURE GENOMIC ELEMENT ACTIVITY, GENE EXPRESSION, AND INSULIN SECRETION IN HPSC-ISLET ORGANOIDS EXPOSED TO TEN DIFFERENT SECRETORY SIGNALS EACH ACROSS FOUR TIME POINTS USING PAIRED SINGLE NUCLEUS ACCESSIBLE CHROMATIN AND GENE EXPRESSION AND PAIRED SINGLE CELL DNA METHYLATION AND 3D CHROMATIN ARCHITECTURE ASSAYS. IN SECTION D WE WILL GENERATE A GRN FROM THESE DATA, USE MACHINE LEARNING TO INFER ELEMENT-GENE AND ELEMENT-PHENOTYPE RELATIONSHIPS AND USE THE TRAINED MODELS TO REFINE THE GRN. FROM THE RESULTING GRN WE WILL PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN SPECIFIC GENOMIC ELEMENTS ON TARGET GENE EXPRESSION, GENE NETWORK ACTIVITY, AND CELLULAR PHENOTYPE. IN SECTION E WE WILL VALIDATE AND REFINE MODELS BY USING MEDIUM-SCALE CRISPR INTERFERENCE OF GENOMIC ELEMENTS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN COMBINATION AS WELL AS ALLELE-SPECIFIC GENE EDITING OF SELECTED GLUCOSE-ASSOCIATED VARIANTS IN HPSC-ISLET ORGANOIDS AND MEASURING GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES IN CIS AND TRANS.

WE FOCUS ON THE GRNS THAT CONTROL EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AS A PARADIGM. ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT LINEAGE DECISION DURING MAMMALIAN DEVELOPMENT IS THE DECISION OF EPIBLAST CELLS TO EXIT THE PLURIPOTENT STATE (A STATE WHEN THE CELLS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GIVE RISE TO ALL SOMATIC CELLS AND GERM CELLS), AND DIFFERENTIATE INTO ONE OF THE THREE PRIMARY GERM LAYERS, THE ENDODERM, MESODERM, AND ECTODERM. THIS PLURIPOTENT STATE AND THE TRILINEAGE DIFFERENTIATION CAN BE CAPTURED USING CULTURED HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS (HESCS). MUCH ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED ON THE GRNS UNDERLYING THE MAINTENANCE OF THE SELF-RENEWING PLURIPOTENT STATE, BUT THE GRNS GOVERNING HESC TRILINEAGE DIFFERENTIATION REMAIN LARGELY UNEXPLORED.

THESE VARIANTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SHED LIGHT ON HUMAN DISEASE MECHANISMS. BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT CHALLENGES. MORE THAN 90% OF COMPLEX DISEASE ASSOCIATED VARIANTS LIE WITHIN NON-CODING REGIONS, POSING A CHALLENGE OF IDENTIFYING RELEVANT CELL TYPES AND CELL STATES, TARGET GENES, AND REGULATORY MECHANISMS.

MOST PRS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED WITHIN EUROPEAN ANCESTRY STUDY SAMPLES AND HAVE SHOWN TO PERFORM POORLY IN OTHER RACE/ETHNIC GROUPS, FURTHER EXAGGERATING HEALTH DISPARITIES ACROSS ANCESTRIES. AS GENETIC APPROACHES FOR PRECISION MEDICINE BECOME MORE POPULAR, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO RESPONSIVELY AND PRO-ACTIVELY EXPAND ACCESS TO ACCURATE PRS. SPECIFICALLY, DIABETES, AND ITS ASSOCIATED COMPLICATIONS ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST GLOBAL HEALTH PROBLEMS OF THE 21ST CENTURY. IN FACT, TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES (T1D AND T2D), GESTATIONAL DIABETES (GDM) AND RELATED COMPLICATIONS ARE EXCELLENT DISEASE MODELS TO STUDY THE UTILITY OF PRS FOR PREDICTING HETEROGENOUS AND COMPLEX HEALTH OUTCOMES IN A SETTING WHERE DRAMATIC RACIAL/ETHNIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITIES EXIST.

HOWEVER, SUCH PRSS MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR DIVERSE ANCESTRY GROUPS TO ENSURE EQUITABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF GENOMIC MEDICINE AND REDUCE THE POTENTIAL EXACERBATION OF HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF GENOMIC MEDICINE. OUR APPLICATION AIMS TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEED TO DEVELOP PRSS FOR DIVERSE ANCESTRY GROUPS AND WILL FOCUS ON CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD) AND ITS RISK FACTORS: HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, OBESITY AND HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, COLLECTIVELY AN ENORMOUS HEALTH BURDEN WORLD-WIDE. CHD IS THE PROTOTYPICAL COMPLEX DISEASE FOR THE USE OF PRSS GIVEN AVAILABLE VALIDATED RISK PREDICTION EQUATIONS THAT BIN INDIVIDUALS INTO RISK CATEGORIES AND SUBSTANTIAL RECLASSIFICATION ACROSS THESE CATEGORIES BY A PRS WITH CONSEQUENT THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS.

ABSTRACT THE UCSC GRADUATE TRAINING PROGRAM IN GENOME SCIENCE COMBINES CUTTING-EDGE COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY TRAINING IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENT. AMONG OTHER STRENGTHS, UC SANTA CRUZ IS A WORLD LEADER IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMIC TECHNOLOGIES AND RNA BIOLOGY. THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM ARE TO PREPARE TRAINEES FOR ADVANCED ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY CAREERS IN BIOMEDICAL GENOMICS. OUR TRAINING PROGRAM DEVELOPS CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS, PROVIDES RIGOROUS HANDS-ON TRAINING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, STATISTICS, AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, AND DEVELOPS SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION SKILLS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR SIX TRAINEES, EACH WITH A TWO-YEAR APPOINTMENT. OUR TRAINEE APPLICANT POOL CONSISTS OF PHD STUDENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY JOINED UCSC\u2019S INTERDISCIPLINARY GENOMICS AND BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES COMMUNITY AND COMPLETED THREE HANDS-ON LABORATORY ROTATIONS DURING THEIR FIRST YEAR OF STUDY, AT LEAST ONE OF WHICH MUST BE CONDUCTED IN THE LABORATORY OF A GS PROGRAM FACULTY MEMBER. GENOME SCIENCE TRAINEES PARTICIPATE IN SEVERAL INNOVATIVE TRAINING ACTIVITIES. EACH YEAR, OUR TRAINEES WILL ORGANIZE AND RUN A BOOTCAMP FOR EACH YEAR\u2019S INCOMING PHD COHORT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE ACCEPTED BY THE DEPT. OF BIOMOLECULAR ENGINEERING. THIS 10-DAY ACTIVITY IS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE T32 TRAINEES WITH FEEDBACK AND GUIDANCE FROM FACULTY. THE CENTERPIECE OF THE BOOTCAMP IS AN AMBITIOUS HANDS-ON ACTIVITY FOR THE INCOMING GRAD COHORT TO TACKLE. PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES HAVE INCLUDED BUILDING A FUNCTIONAL DROPSEQ SINGLE-CELL RNA SEQUENCING MACHINE (2017), AS WELL AS GENOME SEQUENCING AND ASSEMBLY OF THE BANANA SLUG \u2013 UCSC\u2019S MASCOT (2019). TRAINEES RECEIVE TRAINING IN LABS OF 26 FACULTY, INCLUDING A WINNER OF THE MACARTHUR AWARD, MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, AND A NOBEL LAUREATE. FORMAL COURSEWORK FOR TRAINEES INCLUDES GRADUATE- LEVEL INSTRUCTION IN BIOETHICS, PROGRAMMING, PRACTICAL GENOMICS, STATISTICS, AND SCIENTIFIC WRITING. THESE COURSES COVER ESSENTIAL TOPICS IN RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY AND RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH. WORKING WITH THE GRADUATE ADVISING COMMITTEE AND THEIR FACULTY MENTORS, TRAINEES DEVELOP INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH MAY INVOLVE FURTHER COURSEWORK TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC DEFICIENCIES OR SPECIAL INTERESTS. IN COORDINATION WITH THE NHGRI DAP PROGRAM, TRAINEES WILL ALSO SERVE AS MENTORS TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. PROGRAM SUCCESS WILL BE ASSESSED VIA SEVERAL QUANTITATIVE METRICS OF TRAINEE PRODUCTIVITY, SUCH AS THE TIMING AND NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS AND SUCCESS IN APPLYING FOR EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH FUNDS, AS WELL AS CAREER OUTCOMES THAT ARE TRACKED FOLLOWING THE AWARD OF PHDS. THESE METRICS WILL BE ASSESSED BY THE GENOME SCIENCES EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. THE PROGRAM IS INTERDISCIPLINARY, INCLUDING 26 PROGRAM FACULTY FROM 8 DEPARTMENTS. MOST TRAINEES AND APPROXIMATELY HALF OF PROGRAM FACULTY ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE BIOMOLECULAR ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, AS NEARLY ALL BME FACULTY HAVE GENOMICS-FOCUSED RESEARCH PROGRAMS.", "Place of

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, CHEROKEE NATION, THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA (OU) SYSTEM AND THE OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION (OMRF) HAVE PARTNERED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY BUILDING TRIBAL RESEARCH CAPACITY THROUGH THE NATIVE AMERICAN RESEARCH CENTERS FOR HEALTH (NARCH) MECHANISM. IN THIS CYCLE OF NARCH FUNDING, THE PARTNERSHIP AMONG CHEROKEE NATION, OU AND OMRF CONTINUES AND, IMPORTANTLY FOR STUDENT CAREER ENHANCEMENT, EXPANDS TO INCLUDE THE OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU) SYSTEM AS A KEY PARTNER FOR STUDENT CAREER ENHANCEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE OVERALL MISSION OF CHEROKEE NATION NARCH IS TO DEVELOP DURABLE RESEARCH CAPACITY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL NATION TO ADDRESS HEALTH INEQUITIES AFFECTING THE AI POPULATION OF NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE FIVE SPECIFIC AIMS OF CHEROKEE NATION NARCH ARE: 1. TO STRENGTHEN ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING A LEADERSHIP TEAM (LT) AND A TRIBAL-CAMPUS  ADVISORY COMMITTEE (TCAC), THAT ENSURES INTEGRATION OF CAREER ENHANCEMENT, CAPACITY BUILDING AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES; 2. TO EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF RESEARCHERS TO ENGAGE MEANINGFULLY WITH CHEROKEE NATION IN THE CONTEXT  OF TRIBAL RESEARCH, FOCUSING ON UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE AND HEALTH PROFESSIONS STUDENTS; 3. TO BUILD TRIBAL CAPACITY BY DEVELOPING A SET OF RESEARCH CODES TO GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF GENOMIC AND OTHER  BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PREDICATED ON THE CONCEPT OF TRIBAL DATA SOVEREIGNTY; 4. TO CONDUCT INNOVATIVE RESEARCH CAPABLE OF SEEDING FUTURE RESEARCH PROJECTS PERFORMED BY RESEARCHERS  SEEKING TO WORK WITHIN THE CHEROKEE NATION SETTING; AND 5. TO EVALUATE ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP, INCLUDING MONITORING PROGRESS OF STUDENT CAREER ENHANCEMENT,  CAPACITY BUILDING, AND RESEARCH PROJECTS, AND EVALUATION OF THE OVERALL CHEROKEE NATION NARCH PROGRAM. CHEROKEE NATION NARCH PROVIDES A CRUCIAL OPPORTUNITY TO SOLIDIFY THE FOUNDATION FOR TRIBAL CAPACITY IN HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH. THE ADDITION OF OSU STRENGTHENS THIS PROJECT, AS OSU HAS DEMONSTRATED REMARKABLE SUCCESS IN THE EDUCATION OF AI STUDENTS IN SCIENTIFIC AND HEALTH PROFESSIONS FIELDS, INCLUDING THE ADVENT OF THE FIRST TRIBALLY AFFILIATED MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE US.

WE PROPOSE THIS CEGS PROGRAM IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR PARTNERS AT EMORY UNIVERSITY, GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, CHILDREN\u2019S HEALTH CARE OF ATLANTA, AND THE OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORIES. WE FOCUS THE RESEARCH ON THE APPLICATION OF GENOMIC TECHNOLOGIES TO POINT OF CARE UTILITY, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE IMPACT OF RACE, SEX, AND AGE ON TESTING ACCURACY. THE PROGRAM WILL SPUR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR URM STUDENTS WITHING THE ATLANTA UNIVERSITY CENTER, (4 HBCUS IN ATLANTA) AND THEREFORE ENHANCE THE TRAINING AND RETRAINING OF GENOMIC RESEARCHERS FROM URMS.  THE CENTRAL PREMISE OF THE RESEARCH COMPONENT OF THIS CENTER IS THAT BLOOD TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS MAY OFFER AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO DIAGNOSE DISEASE OR INJURY FOR MANY CLINICAL CONDITIONS. THE GAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO PUSH THIS TECHNOLOGY APPROACH CLOSER TO CLINICAL PRACTICE BY UNDERSTANDING KEY ELEMENTS OF THE APPROACH AND TO LEARN GENERALIZABLE RULES FOR IMPLEMENTATION. TO DO THIS WE USE THREE INTERLINKED STUDIES ON HEALTHY, ACUTE BRAIN INJURY AND LONG-TERM CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, TO TEST REPRODUCIBILITY, AND PREDICTION ACCURACY. WE UTILIZE ESTABLISHED RESEARCH PROGRAMS TO ENABLE A RAPID TESTING OF THE APPROACHES, AND THE COMPUTATIONAL EXPERTISE OF THE OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORIES TO HARNESS AI MATHEMATIC MODELING TO ENHANCE PREDICTION ACCURACY. AT THE END OF THE RESEARCH PROGRAM, WE WILL HAVE ESTABLISHED A SERIES OF BEST PRACTICES FOR DISSEMINATION AND FUTURE USE OF THE APPROACH. THE SPECIFIC RESEARCH AIMS ARE 1). WHAT IS THE VARIANCE OF GENE EXPRESSION IN BLOOD? 2). DETERMINE THE ACCURACY OF BLOOD RNA EXPRESSION PROFILE TO PREDICT THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF AN ACUTE MEDICAL EVENT? 3). CAN A BLOOD RNA EXPRESSION SIGNATURE IDENTIFY A PATIENT\u2019S OUTCOME OR DISEASE TRAJECTORY (PROGNOSIS)?

A MAJOR MEDIATOR OF POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL GENE REGULATION IS THE TRANSLATING RIBOSOME, WHICH COMPRISES THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RNAS: RRNA, TRNA AND MRNA. THESE RNAS, ALONG WITH RIBOSOMAL AND MRNA-BINDING PROTEINS, FORM A MULTI-RNA/MULTI-PROTEIN COMPLEX THAT CAN MARKEDLY INFLUENCE MRNA STABILITY AND TRANSLATION. IMPORTANTLY, THIS COMPLEX IS NOT CONSTITUTIVE. INSTEAD, RRNA-TRNA, RRNA-MRNA, AND TRNA-MRNA INTERACTIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISMS OF ITS REGULATION ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. A POTENTIAL MECHANISM MAY INVOLVE CHEMICAL MODIFICATION OF THEIR NUCLEOTIDES. INDEED, RRNA, TRNA AND MRNA ARE SUBJECTED TO DIVERSE CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS WHOSE STOICHIOMETRY IS HIGHLY REGULATED IN DIFFERENT TISSUES OR DISEASE STATES. OUR UNDERLYING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE REGULATED NUCLEOTIDE MODIFICATIONS IN RRNA, TRNA, AND MRNA ACT AS A \u201cCODE\u201d THAT CONTROLS THESE RNAS AND THEIR MUTUAL INTERACTIONS, THUS ENCODING UNIQUE PATTERNS OF GENE EXPRESSION. ALTHOUGH RRNA, TRNA, AND MRNA NUCLEOTIDE MODIFICATIONS ARE POISED TO BE CRITICAL REGULATORS OF GENE EXPRESSION, STUDYING HOW THESE MODIFICATIONS INFLUENCE EACH OTHER TO CONTROL GENE EXPRESSION HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO EXPLORE. IN PART THIS REFLECTS THE LACK OF SCALABLE METHODS TO QUANTIFY AND PROFILE NUCLEOTIDE MODIFICATIONS IN RRNA, TRNA, AND MRNA. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT UNDERSTANDING THE INTERACTIONS OF RRNA, TRNA, AND MRNA REQUIRES SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE IN EACH OF THESE THREE MAJOR AREAS OF RNA BIOLOGY. IT IS THEREFORE CRITICAL FOR EXPERTS IN RRNA, TRNA, AND MRNA TO WORK TOGETHER TO DECIPHER THE MUTUAL INTERACTIONS OF THESE RNAS. THE CENTER WILL BRING TOGETHER A TEAM OF EXPERTS IN THESE DIVERSE TYPES OF RNAS WHO WILL WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP NOVEL TECHNIQUES TO PROBE NUCLEOTIDE MODIFICATIONS AND HOW THEY INTERACT TO ORCHESTRATE UNIQUE PATTERNS OF GENE EXPRESSION. THE CENTER WILL DEVELOP NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES FOR MAPPING AND QUANTIFYING RRNA, TRNA, AND MRNA MODIFICATIONS, IDENTIFY THE DYNAMIC MODIFICATION SITES IN TISSUES AND DISEASE, AND DETERMINE THE FUNCTION OF THESE DYNAMIC MODIFICATIONS. THE METHODS AND DATASETS THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED IN THE CENTER WILL PROVIDE THE FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO ACCELERATE NEW AREAS OF EPITRANSCRIPTOMICS RESEARCH IN RRNA, TRNA, AND MRNA BIOLOGY. THE CENTER HAS A MAJOR OUTREACH AND EDUCATIONAL MISSION. THE OUTREACH/EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WILL INCLUDE SPONSORED UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH, BREAKOUT PROJECT FUNDING, PROJECT FUNDING FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY TRAINEES, FUNDING FOR TRAINING VISITING OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS, AND FUNDING FOR AN ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP A WEBSITE THAT CURATES THE EPITRANSCRIPTOMIC MAPPING DATA GENERATED BY THE CENTER TO ENSURE RAPID AND EASY ACCESS TO THE NEW DATA WE GENERATE.

COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GENETICS AND SOCIAL FACTORS INFLUENCE HEALTH OUTCOMES. APPROXIMATELY 33% OF PEOPLE IN THE US BELONG TO AN ETHNIC MINORITY GROUP AND ~12.5% LIVE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. HISTORICAL AND RECENT MIXING OF EUROPEANS, NATIVE AMERICANS, AFRICANS AND ASIANS RESULTED IN THE US POPULATION HAVING A RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF ADMIXED INDIVIDUALS WHO CARRY ANCESTRY FROM OUTSIDE THEIR SELF-IDENTIFIED RACE. THE ALL OF US (AOU) PROGRAM AND THE MILLION VETERANS PROGRAM (MVP) INCLUDE GENETIC, HEALTH AND SOCIOECONOMIC INFORMATION ON ALL PARTICIPANTS, AND THEREFORE PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH DISPARITIES. HOWEVER, THE AOU PROGRAM AND MVP REQUIRE THEIR DATA TO STAY WITHIN LOCAL HOSTING SITES, THEREFORE CONDUCTING JOINT ANALYSES ON THESE COHORTS REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALGORITHMS THAT ENABLE PRIVACY-PROTECTING DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING (I.E., WITHOUT REVEALING INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DATA). THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: 1) MOST STUDIES HAVE BEEN DOMINATED BY EUROPEAN INDIVIDUALS, AND WHILE THEY CONTROL FOR GLOBAL ANCESTRY, THERE IS NO ATTEMPT TO MODEL THE PATCHWORK OF LOCAL ANCESTRY CHARACTERISTIC OF ADMIXED INDIVIDUALS; 2) GWAS ARE PRIMARILY CONDUCTED USING SNPS, WHILE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF ANCESTRY-SPECIFIC GENETIC VARIATION (TANDEM REPEATS (TRS) AND THE MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX (MHC) INTERVAL) ARE NOT ASSAYED; AND 3) MOST GWAS DO NOT ADJUST FOR SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS. THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL GENETICS AND GENOMICS (ACMG) HAS PUBLISHED A LIST OF MEDICALLY ACTIONABLE CANCER AND CARDIOVASCULAR GENES RECOMMENDED FOR RETURN OF INCIDENTAL FINDINGS OF PATHOGENIC VARIANTS TO REDUCE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, BUT HAVING MINORITIES EXCLUDED FROM HEALTHCARE FOLLOW UP DUE TO COMMON BARRIERS (E.G., LANGUAGE AND ACCESS) MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE GENETIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO DISPARATE HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE GOAL OF THE CAST (CENTER FOR ADMIXTURE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY) PROGRAM IS TO IMPROVE THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF GENETIC INFORMATION FOR ALL POPULATIONS LIVING IN THE US.

WE WILL PUSH THIS TECHNOLOGY AND USE ITS BEST-IN-CLASS CAPABILITIES TO MAKE PROGRESS IN NEURODEVELOPMENT AND PEDIATRIC CANCER, ADDRESSING BIG QUESTIONS.

"SINGLE-CELL MULTIOMIC METHODS FOR STUDYING GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION - PROJECT SUMMARY THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) GENOME ORGANIZATION IN THE NUCLEUS IS PIVOTAL TO VARIOUS GENOME FUNCTIONS SUCH TRANSCRIPTION AND DNA REPLICATION. RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN BOTH GENOMIC AND IMAGING-BASED TECHNOLOGIES HAS DRASTICALLY ADVANCED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MULTISCALE 3D GENOME STRUCTURES AND THEIR VARIABILITY IN SINGLE CELLS. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH METHODS CAN SEPARATELY MAP TRANSCRIPTOME (E.G., SINGLE-CELL RNA-SEQ) OR 3D GENOME (E.G., SINGLE-CELL HI-C), NO TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TO MAP BOTH 3D GENOME AND TRANSCRIPTOME IN THE SAME CELLS, SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITING THE INVESTIGATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AT THE SINGLE-CELL LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE, WITHOUT SUCH A CO-ASSAYED METHOD, IT REMAINS INFEASIBLE TO STUDY HOW 3D GENOME ARCHITECTURE FUNCTIONALLY INFORMS SPATIOTEMPORAL TRANSCRIPTIONAL REWIRING IN SINGLE CELLS IN DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES. TO FILL THIS MAJOR GAP IN THE FIELD OF SINGLE-CELL EPIGENOMICS, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR QUANTITATIVELY COMPARING 3D GENOME AND GENE EXPRESSION IN THE SAME SINGLE CELLS. WE WILL DEVELOP CARE- SEQ, A NOVEL SINGLE-CELL MULTIOMIC SOLUTION, COUPLED BY OUR STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS, TO UNVEIL THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN 3D GENOME ORGANIZATION AND GENE EXPRESSION AS WELL AS THEIR SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS. (1) WE WILL DEVELOP THE FIRST CO-ASSAYED METHOD TO JOINTLY MEASURE WHOLE-GENOME CHROMATIN INTERACTIONS AND GENE EXPRESSION IN THE SAME SINGLE CELLS FROM COMPLEX TISSUES IN A MASSIVELY PARALLEL MANNER. (2) WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW METHOD TO CONCURRENTLY PROFILE SINGLE-CELL TRANSCRIPTOME AND SPECIFIC PROMOTER- ENHANCER LOOPS IN THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL CELLS. (3) WE WILL FURTHER COMBINE SPATIAL BIOLOGY WITH OUR SINGLE-CELL METHOD TO DEVELOP A SPATIALLY RESOLVED APPROACH FOR DECIPHERING IN SITU DYNAMICS OF BOTH 3D GENOME AND GENE EXPRESSION IN SINGLE-CELL RESOLUTION FOR TISSUES.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE SEEK TO ADVANCE THE FIELD TOWARDS A PREDICTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF CELL STATE BY ADDRESSING THE FUNDAMENTAL GAP IN KNOWLEDGE: WHAT ARE THE GENES AND REGULATORY NETWORKS THAT DRIVE A CELL\u2019S TRANSCRIPTIONAL STATE? THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF CELL STATE AND TO MANIPULATE CELL STATE FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS. TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS (TFS) COOPERATIVELY DRIVE GENE REGULATORY NETWORKS (GRNS) TO ESTABLISH TRANSCRIPTIONAL STATES. NOTABLY, FORCED INDUCTION OF TFS CAN REPROGRAM GENE EXPRESSION STATES BY SUP- PLANTING EXISTING GRNS. THUS, TFS AND GRNS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO A PREDICTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF A CELL\u2019S TRANSCRIPTIONAL STATE. ONE KEY CHALLENGE IS THAT, IN GENERAL, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TFS AND GRNS IS NOT KNOWN AND IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY PREDICT. THIS CHALLENGE ARISES FROM SEVERAL CURRENT PROBLEMS: A LACK OF GROUND TRUTH GRNS DERIVED FROM EXPERIMENTAL TF PERTURBATION, A RELIANCE ON STATIC TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATABASES TO INFER GRNS FOR TF COCKTAIL PREDICTION, AND THE DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING NON-LINEAR TF BEHAVIORS. UNTIL WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW TFS COOPERATIVELY INFLUENCE GRNS, OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT THE TF DRIVERS OF CELL STATE WILL REMAIN LIMITED. OUR LONG- TERM GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF TRANSCRIPTIONAL STATE FOR APPLICATIONS IN CELLULAR ENGINEERING. TOWARDS THIS GOAL, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO GENERATE A UNIQUE RESOURCE TO DIRECTLY MEASURE GRNS FOR SIMPLE COMBINATIONS OF TFS, AND TO USE THIS FUNCTIONAL KNOWLEDGEBASE TO PREDICT AND BENCHMARK COMPLEX TF COCKTAILS FOR TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPROGRAMMING. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT EXPERIMENTALLY-DERIVED GRNS WILL IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF PREDICTED TF COCKTAILS FOR TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPROGRAMMING. OUR RATIONALE IS THAT THESE STUDIES WILL 1) PROVIDE A NOVEL AND URGENTLY NEEDED RESOURCE OF TF FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AND EXPERIMENTALLY-DERIVED GRNS FOR THE COMMUNITY, 2) PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE MOLECULAR DRIVERS OF TRANSCRIPTIONAL STATE, AND 3) IDENTIFY TFS WITH POTENTIAL TO ENGINEER GENE EXPRESSION STATES FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: (AIM 1) MEASURE THE COMBINATORIAL ACTIVITIES OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; (AIM 2) IMPROVE COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORKS TO PREDICT TF COCKTAILS FOR TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPROGRAMMING; (AIM 3) GENERALIZE TF-DRIVEN GRNS ACROSS INITIAL CELL CONTEXTS AND BENCHMARK PREDICTIONS. THIS PROPOSAL IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT WILL USE OUR SINGLE-CELL PLATFORM RE- PROGRAM-SEQ 2.0 FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPROGRAMMING TO GENERATE A UNIQUE RESOURCE OF FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR TFS AND GRNS.

FIRST, WE WILL DEVELOP HAPLOTYPE-INFORMED COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THAT IMPROVE DETECTION SENSITIVITY AND GENOTYPING ACCURACY FOR SEVERAL CLASSES OF STRUCTURAL VARIATION USING SHORT- READ SEQUENCING DATA.

THE LEVEL AT WHICH WE UNDERSTAND THE INHERENT COMPLEXITY OF GENE REGULATION ULTIMATELY DICTATES OUR ABILITY TO LINK AND/OR MANIPULATE BIOMOLECULAR CHANGES AND PATHOLOGY. BEYOND THEIR FUNCTION AS A STRUCTURAL SUBSTRATE, HISTONE PROTEINS PLAY KEY ROLES IN GENE EXPRESSION BY SELECTIVELY GATING ACCESS TO DNA AND THEREBY GUIDING WHEN AND HOW TRANSCRIPTIONAL MACHINERY ENGAGES THE HUMAN GENOME. HISTONE-BASED GENE REGULATORY CONTROL LARGELY STEMS FROM POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS (PTMS) TO HISTONE PROTEINS THEMSELVES. ONE TYPE OF PTM, HISTONE LYSINE ACETYLATION, IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL FOR GENE REGULATION AND HUMAN HEALTH, BECAUSE OVERALL ACETYLATION LEVELS TIGHTLY CORRELATE WITH GENOMIC ACTIVITY AND GENE EXPRESSION, AND INAPPROPRIATE HISTONE ACETYLATION PATTERNS ARE LINKED TO DIVERSE HUMAN DISEASES. IN FACT, SMALL MOLECULES THAT GLOBALLY CHANGE HISTONE ACETYLATION ACROSS THE HUMAN GENOME HAVE EMERGED AS IMPORTANT THERAPEUTICS. HOWEVER, IN MANY PATIENTS THESE DRUGS CAN BE INEFFECTIVE AND/OR CAN RESULT IN TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS. FURTHERMORE, SMALL MOLECULES THAT GLOBALLY ALTER HISTONE ACETYLATION PATTERNS CANNOT BE USED TO DISSECT HOW CHANGES AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IN THE HUMAN GENOME DRIVE DISEASE PATHOLOGY. ROBUST TOOLS THAT ENABLE PRECISE AND TARGETED CONTROL OVER ENDOGENOUS HISTONE ACETYLATION ARE URGENTLY NEEDED, BECAUSE THESE TECHNOLOGIES COULD ILLUMINATE THE FUNCTION(S) THAT THIS COMPLEX EPIGENOMIC SIGNATURE PLAYS WITHIN THE HUMAN GENOME AND OPEN THE DOOR TO NEW SOPHISTICATED EPIGENETIC THERAPIES. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL FULFILL THIS URGENT NEED BY BUILDING SYNTHETIC AND PRECISELY TARGETABLE BIOMOLECULES THAT MIMIC THE SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITIES DISPLAYED BY NATURAL HUMAN HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASES (HATS) AND HISTONE DEACETYLASES (HDACS) (AIM 1). SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL COMBINE THE PROGRAMMABILITY OF THE NUCLEASE NULL CRISPR/CAS9 (DCAS9) SCAFFOLD WITH DIFFERENT CLASSES OF HUMAN HATS/HDACS AND WE WILL USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO PROBE THE SELECTIVITY OF DIFFERENT HATS/HDACS IN VITRO AND WITHIN NATIVE HUMAN CHROMATIN. WE WILL INTEGRATE OUR RESULTS WITH EPIGENOMIC PROFILING DATA TO DEFINE HOW EPIGENETIC MARKS, NUCLEOSOME OCCUPANCY, AND CIS REGULATORY ELEMENT PROXIMITY INFLUENCE THE EFFECTS OF HISTONE ACETYLATION AT HUMAN ENHANCERS AND PROMOTERS. WE WILL ALSO USE MASS SPECTROMETRY, DCAS9-BASED TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATORS AND HATS, AND GENOME-SCALE KNOCKOUT SCREENING TO DEFINE THE PROTEINS/PROTEIN COMPLEXES THAT SUPPORT HISTONE ACETYLATION-BASED GENE ACTIVATION (AIM 2).

SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT, THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED METHOD TO DETECT EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION OF ENHANCERS AND PROMOTERS, ACCURATELY IDENTIFIES GENES AND PROMOTERS, BUT OFTEN FAILS TO DETECT MANY FUNCTIONALLY CONSERVED DISTAL ENHANCERS, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ORTHOLOGOUS TFS GENERALLY HAVE CONSERVED BINDING ACTIVITY.

WHILE CAS13 HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE SPECIFIC RNA CLEAVAGE ACTIVITY IN SOME CELL TYPES, OTHER CELL TYPES HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL CLEAVAGE OF CELLULAR RNAS, LEADING TO TOXICITY IN CELL MODELS. AN IDEAL RNA TARGETING TOOL FOR MAMMALIAN APPLICATIONS WOULD LACK COLLATERAL ACTIVITY AND ONLY CLEAVE THE TARGETED SUBSTRATE. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BY COMBINING COMPUTATIONAL DISCOVERY, BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION, AND ENZYME ENGINEERING TO FIND NEW RNA TARGETING CRISPR NUCLEASES, ADAPT THESE ENZYMES FOR MAMMALIAN USE, AND DEVELOP SPECIFIC RNA TARGETING TOOLS FOR TRANSCRIPTOME ENGINEERING AND TRANSCRIPTOME-WIDE SCREENING.

THIS PHASE-1 PRODUCT INCORPORATES INNOVATIONS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EARLY ADOPTER CUSTOMERS, ACHIEVING EFFICIENT MULTI-OMIC MAPPING OF TBP AND CHROMATIN INTERACTIONS IN HIGHER INPUT FROZEN CELLS AND TISSUES, AND A DEFINED SUBSET OF TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROTEINS. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED OUR PHASE-1 PRODUCT FOR WORKFLOW INTEGRATION, LEVERAGING INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS TO REDUCE BARRIERS IN CHIP AND BIOINFORMATICS COMPONENTS OF THE WORKFLOW, RESPECTIVELY. OUR TEAM HAS DEEP EXPERTISE IN THE SCIENCE OF CHROMATIN INTERACTION CAPTURE, GENE REGULATION, AND ITS COMMERCIALIZATION. IN 2018, WE COMMERCIALIZED ARIMA- HIC KITS FOR STUDYING GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CHROMATIN INTERACTIONS AND WITHIN 2 YEARS HAVE ACCUMULATED 500+ CUSTOMERS, PROVIDING TOOLS TO ENABLE PUBLISHED DISCOVERIES ACROSS A HOST OF BASIC SCIENCE AND DISEASE RESEARCH. BASED ON VOC ANALYTICS, WE SHIFTED OUR FOCUS TO DEVELOP THE A-HICHIP KIT - A MORE RELATABLE PRODUCT TO THE GENE REGULATION MARKET THAT CUSTOMERS WANTED AND THAT REPRESENTED A LARGER MARKET OPPORTUNITY. INDEED, AFTER OUR SELF-FUNDED PHASE-1 R&D AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS, WE LAUNCHED OUR MVP A-HICHIP SOLUTION INTO THE MARKET AND HAVE SEEN REMARKABLE SUCCESS \u2013 MEASURED BY AN INCREASE IN OUR REVENUE CONTRIBUTIONS, INCREASED QUALITY OF REVENUE, AND TRACTION WITH KEY OPINION LEADERS (KOLS), LARGE CONSORTIA, AND COVID RESEARCH. HOWEVER, OUR PHASE-1 A-HICHIP HAS KNOWN LIMITATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE PRODUCT FALLS SHORT OF MEETING THE NEEDS OF RESEARCHERS UTILIZING COMMON CLINICAL SAMPLES TYPES OR QUANTITIES IN THEIR RESEARCH, OR SEEKING SINGLE-CELL RESOLUTION IN THEIR ANALYSES OF HETEROGENEOUS TISSUES.

ABSTRACT ARMONICA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. IS PROPOSING TO DEVELOP A NOVEL, HIGH-THROUGHPUT, LABEL-FREE, HIGHLY ACCURATE, LONG-READ DNA SEQUENCING PLATFORM BASED ON INEXPENSIVE NANOSCALE PATTERNING AND SELF- ASSEMBLY. THE PLATFORM CONSISTS OF NANOCHANNELS (CROSS SECTION DIMENSIONS OF ~ 100NM); TORTUOUS (CONVOLUTED 3D) NANOPORES FORMED BY SELF-ASSEMBLY OF COLLOIDAL NANOPARTICLES; NANOPARTICLE BARRIERS PLACED ACROSS THE NANOCHANNELS; AND A METAL-INSULATOR-METAL (MIM) FIELD ENHANCEMENT STRUCTURE ATOP THE NANOCHANNEL ROOF. IN OPERATION, SINGLE- STRANDED- OR DOUBLE-STRANDED-DNA IS PARTIALLY STRETCHED INTO A LINEAR CONFIGURATION IN THE NANOCHANNELS, IS BLOCKED AT BARRIERS INCORPORATED INTO THE CHANNELS AND FORCED (BY ELECTRIC FIELD) TO TRANSLOCATE THROUGH THE TORTUOUS NANOPORES IN THE ROOF.

OPTICAL DETECTION ALLOWS MASSIVELY PARALLEL OPERATION SINCE THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS SEPARATION OF THE PORES BY MORE THAN AN OPTICAL WAVELENGTH, EASILY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE FABRICATION. AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE PLATFORM IS THAT THE POROUS ROOFS ALLOW INTRODUCTION OF OLIGONUCLEOTIDES, SMALL PROTEINS, AND DNA- BINDING/DNA-PROCESSING ENZYMES, PERMITTING OPTIONAL MANIPULATION AND MODIFICATION OF THE DNA IN THE NANOCHANNELS.

IT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE DIAGNOSTIC RATES AND ACCURACY IN THE CLINIC, ESPECIALLY IN RARE DISEASE, WHERE A LACK OF GENETIC EVIDENCE OFTEN RESULTS IN SEVERELY DELAYED AND INACCURATE DIAGNOSES. ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL ALLOW THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP MORE SUCCESSFUL TARGETED THERAPIES AND TO DESIGN MORE INCLUSIVE CLINICAL TRIALS AS WELL AS TO MORE RELIABLY IDENTIFY PATIENTS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION.

PROVEN TO BE AMONG THE MOST ELUSIVE. A REMARKABLE 30% OF LUNG ADENOCARCINOMAS, 45% OF COLON, AND 98% OF PANCREATIC CANCERS ARE DRIVEN BY KRAS MUTATIONS. THESE CANCERS ACCOUNT FOR THE TOP 3 CAUSES OF CANCER-RELATED DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES. MOST CANCER ASSOCIATED KRAS MUTATIONS RESULT IN A CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVE PROTEIN, WHICH DRIVES ABERRANTLY HIGH DOWNSTREAM SIGNALING OF PRO-PROLIFERATIVE AND PRO-SURVIVAL EFFECTORS INCLUDING THE MAPK AND PI3K PATHWAYS. KINASE INHIBITORS HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED TREATMENT OF MANY CANCERS DRIVEN BY OTHER MOLECULAR ABERRATIONS, YET, UNFORTUNATELY A LACK OF SUCH SUCCESS IN KRAS-DRIVEN CANCERS HAS LED TO KRAS ITSELF TO BE WIDELY REGARDED AS \u201cUNDRUGGABLE\u201d. ENFUEGO THERAPEUTICS, INC. (EFTX) WAS FOUNDED TO ADDRESS THE GROWING NUMBER OF \u201cUNDRUGGABLE\u201d TARGETS IN CANCER USING RNA INTERFERENCE (RNAI)-BASED THERAPEUTICS. RNAI IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE FOR KRAS TARGETING BECAUSE IT CAN BE OPTIMIZED TO ENABLE SELECTIVE SILENCING OF MUTANT TRANSCRIPTS WHILE SPARING WILD TYPE TRANSCRIPTS, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR MAINTAINING NORMAL FUNCTION IN NONMALIGNANT TISSUE. MUTATION-SPECIFIC THERAPEUTICS AGAINST KRAS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY SEVERAL COMPANIES SUCH AS AMGEN AND MIRATI, AND RELY ON SMALL MOLECULES (SPECIFIC ONLY TO G12C MUTATIONS). UNLIKE PRIOR RNAI STRATEGIES IN CANCER, THE EFTX APPROACH EMPLOYS NUCLEOTIDE MODIFICATION AND LIGAND CONJUGATION CHEMISTRIES TO PROMOTE IN VIVO STABILITY AND AFFINITY-BASED TARGETING IN CANCER CELLS. IN PARTICULAR, LIGAND CONJUGATION REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER LEGACY DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS LIPID NANOPARTICLES. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT ENFUEGO SIRNAS TARGETING MUTANT KRAS TRANSCRIPTS RESULT IN: 1) REDUCED ONCOGENIC MAPK SIGNALING, 2) REDUCED CANCER CELL PROLIFERATION, AND 3) REDUCED TUMOR BURDEN IN MURINE CANCER MODELS. BASED ON THESE PRELIMINARY DATA, THIS FAST TRACK PROGRAM WILL FURTHER DEVELOP EFTX SIRNA TECHNOLOGIES FOR TARGETING MUTANT KRAS IN HUMANS. DURING PHASE I, WE WILL FOCUS ON OPTIMIZATION OF FULLY CHEMICALLY MODIFIED (FM) SIRNA COMPOUNDS THAT POTENTLY AND SPECIFICALLY SILENCE MUTANT G12V TRANSCRIPTS, EXHIBIT SERUM STABILITY AND IMMUNE STEALTH, AND INHIBIT DOWNSTREAM CANCER CELL SIGNALING. TWO TO THREE FM SIRNAS WILL BE SELECTED AS LEAD COMPOUND CANDIDATES FOR PROGRESSION TO PHASE II STUDIES.

BLADDER CANCER (BC) IS THE 6TH MOST COMMON CANCER IN THE US. APPROXIMATELY 90% OF BC CASES ARE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA AND 75% ARE NMIBC AT DIAGNOSIS. THE TREATMENTS AND PROGNOSES ARE VERY DIFFERENT BETWEEN NMIBC AND MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER (MIBC). WITH LIMITED DISTINGUISHING MOLECULAR FEATURES, NMIBC AND MIBC ARE CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND DEPTH OF INVASION, WHICH IS INSUFFICIENT FOR RELIABLE OUTCOME PREDICTION OR TREATMENT GUIDANCE. NMIBC IS A HETEROGENEOUS SUBCLASSIFICATION (STAGES 0 AND 1) OF UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH RATES OF RECURRENCE AND DISEASE PROGRESSION (AS HIGH AS 40% WITHIN 2 YEARS OF INITIAL TREATMENT, WITH ROUGHLY 10% OF ALL CASES PROGRESSING TO MIBC).

SUBTLE CHANGES IN EXPRESSION OF VARIOUS PROTEIN FORMS ARE CRITICAL FOR PROPER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, BUT IRREGULARITIES CAN CAUSE DELETERIOUS CELLULAR EFFECTS OR LARGE-SCALE BIOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION. PROTEINS CONSIST OF CHAINS OF AMINO ACIDS, WHICH ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PROTEIN. AS SUCH, THE ABILITY TO GATHER THE ENTIRE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF LOW ABUNDANCE PROTEINS CAN GREATLY ACCELERATE RESEARCH INTO PROTEIN FUNCTION AND BIOL- OGY. HOWEVER, IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE RELATIVE SUCCESS OF DNA SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO SEQUENCE SINGLE PROTEIN MOLECULES AT SINGLE-AMINO-ACID RESOLUTION. TWO METHODS ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOR PROTEIN SEQUENCING. THE FIRST METHOD, \u201cEDMAN DEGRADATION\u201d, RE- QUIRES PURIFICATION OF THE TARGET PROTEIN. BULK QUANTITIES OF WHOLE PROTEIN OR PURIFIED FRAGMENTS ARE SEQUENCED BY CLEAVING OFF THE FIRST (N-TERMINAL) AMINO ACID AND CHEMICALLY IDENTIFYING IT. THE SECOND METHOD, BASED ON MASS SPECTROMETRY, REQUIRES ENZYMATICALLY DEGRADING A SINGLE PROTEIN OR MIXTURE OF PROTEINS INTO SMALL FRAGMENTS, THEN ANALYZING THE MOLECULAR MASS AND CHARGE OF EACH FRAGMENT. THIS INFORMATION IS COMPARED TO THAT OF KNOWN PROTEIN SEQUENCES TO INFER THE IDENTITY OF THE INPUT PROTEINS. BOTH OF THESE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE METHODS SUFFER FROM LOW SENSITIVITY, REQUIRING ~1 MILLION MOLECULES OF EACH PROTEIN FOR DETECTION. EDMAN DEGRADATION CANNOT CURRENTLY BE USED IN HETEROGENOUS PROTEIN MIXTURES, FURTHER LIMITING ITS UTILITY. CRITICAL HURDLES IN SINGLE MOLECULE PROTEIN SEQUENCING ARE THE NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF AMINO ACIDS, AS WELL AS THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AMINO ACIDS THAT INTERFERE WITH REAGENTS THAT CAN IDENTIFY AMINO ACIDS BY THEIR CHEMICAL SIDE CHAINS. CURRENT APPROACHES BEING DEVELOPED FOR SINGLE-MOLECULE PROTEIN SEQUENCING COULD AVOID SOME OF THESE ISSUES BY EMPLOYING HARSH DENATURATION AGENTS, BUT THESE CAN COMPROMISE THE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. IN ADDITION, DENATURATION AGENTS ONLY REMOVE SOME OF THE INTRAMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS OF PROTEINS.

THE BASIC CONCEPT BEHIND NANOPORES INVOLVES USING AN APPLIED VOLTAGE TO DRIVE SINGLE-STRANDED DNA MOLECULES THROUGH A NARROW NANOPORE, WHICH SEPARATES CHAMBERS OF ELECTROLYTE SOLUTION. THIS VOLTAGE ALSO DRIVES A FLOW OF ELECTROLYTE IONS THROUGH THE PORE, MEASURED AS AN ELECTRIC CURRENT. WHEN MOLECULES PASS THROUGH THE NANOPORE THEY MODIFY THE FLOW OF IONS, AND STRUCTURAL INFORMATION CAN BE EXTRACTED BY ANALYSIS OF THE DURATION AND MAGNITUDE OF THE RESULTING CURRENT REDUCTIONS. NANOPORE IN ATOMICALLY-THIN 2D MEMBRANES IMPROVE THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO FOR MOLECULAR DETECTION AND ANALYSIS BECAUSE THE RESISTANCE TO THE IONIC FLOW THROUGH A PORE INCREASES LINEARLY WITH THE PORE THICKNESS, SO BOTH THE MAGNITUDES OF THE IONIC CURRENT AND THE BLOCKED CURRENT WITH A TRANSLOCATING MOLECULE INCREASE WITH DECREASING NANOPORE HEIGHT.

WE WILL COUPLE 1) RATIONAL DESIGN OF AMINO ACID MUTATIONS USING THE PROTEIN DESIGN SOFTWARE, ROSETTA, AND 2) IN SILICO BIOPROSPECTING TO PRODUCE SCREENING LIBRARIES COMPRISING PHYLOGENETICALLY DIVERSE TDT BACKGROUNDS. THIS COMBINED ENZYME ENGINEERING APPROACH HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO IDENTIFY ENZYME MUTANTS WITH DISTINCT PHENOTYPES. WE WILL EXPRESS AND SCREEN THE RESULTING TARGETED LIBRARIES USING OUR ESTABLISHED HIGH-THROUGHPUT NUCLEOTIDE INCORPORATION ASSAYS TO IDENTIFY THE MOST ACTIVE TDT VARIANTS. WE WILL THEN OPTIMIZE THE ENZYMATIC CLEAN-UP AND DEBLOCKING STEPS WITH THE GOAL OF PERFORMING A SHORT PROOF OF CONCEPT DNA SYNTHESIS USING THE LEAD TDT VARIANT(S) AND 3'-O- PHOSPHATE-NUCLEOTIDES. KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM PHASE I PROTEIN ENGINEERING AND SHORT SYNTHESIS TESTS WILL GUIDE FURTHER TDT IMPROVEMENTS IN PHASE II TOWARDS SYNTHESIS OF DNA WITH LONGER LENGTHS AND WITH LOWER ERROR RATES. THE FULLY ENZYMATIC SYNTHESIS CYCLE PROPOSED TO BE DEVELOPED REPRESENTS A COMPLETE WORKFLOW FOR DNA SYNTHESIS, WITH COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL FOR IMPLEMENTATION AS A REPLACEMENT FOR CHEMICAL DNA MANUFACTURING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0b9be448-e063-06bb-60ad-ba2a720c1fbe-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43HG011679_7529"}, {"internal_id": 128681160, "Award ID": "R43HG011608", "Award Amount": 349200.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-03-16", "CFDA Number": "93.172", "Description": "SINGLE MOLECULE DNA/RNA TRANSPORT AND RAMAN SCATTERING READOUT IN A COUPLED NANOCHANNEL/NANOPORE SEQUENCING SYSTEM. - SINGLE MOLECULE DNA/RNA TRANSPORT AND RAMAN SCATTERING READOUT IN A COUPLED  NANOCHANNEL/NANOPORE SEQUENCING SYSTEM ARMONICA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. IS PROPOSING TO DEVELOP A NOVEL, HIGH-THROUGHPUT, LABEL-FREE, HIGHLY ACCURATE, LONG-READ DNA SEQUENCING PLATFORM BASED ON INEXPENSIVE NANOSCALE PATTERNING AND SELF- ASSEMBLY. THE PLATFORM CONSISTS OF NANOCHANNELS (CROSS SECTION DIMENSIONS OF ~ 100 NM); TORTUOUS (CONVOLUTED, 3D) NANOPORES FORMED BY SELF-ASSEMBLY OF COLLOIDAL NANOPARTICLES; NANOPARTICLE BARRIERS PLACED ACROSS THE NANOCHANNELS; AND A METAL-INSULATOR-METAL (MIM) FIELD ENHANCEMENT STRUCTURE ATOP THE NANOCHANNEL ROOF. IN OPERATION, SINGLE- STRANDED- OR DOUBLE-STRANDED-DNA IS PARTIALLY STRETCHED INTO A LINEAR CONFIGURATION IN THE NANOCHANNELS, IS BLOCKED AT BARRIERS INCORPORATED INTO THE CHANNELS AND FORCED (BY ELECTRIC FIELD) TO TRANSLOCATE THROUGH THE TORTUOUS NANOPORES IN THE ROOF. THE MIM STRUCTURE ON THE ROOF LOCALLY ENHANCES THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS OF APPLIED LASER SOURCES ALLOWING SURFACE ENHANCED COHERENT ANTI-STOKES RAMAN SCATTERING (SECARS) DETECTION OF INDIVIDUAL BASES AS THEY PASS THROUGH THE ELECTROMAGNETIC HOT SPOTS, THUS PROVIDING SINGLE BASE SENSITIVITY AND SPATIAL LOCALIZATION. THE DISTINCT RAMAN SPECTRA OF THE INDIVIDUAL BASES ALLOW LABEL-FREE SEQUENCING. OPTICAL DETECTION ALLOWS MASSIVELY PARALLEL OPERATION SINCE THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS SEPARATION OF THE PORES BY MORE THAN AN OPTICAL WAVELENGTH, WHICH IS EASILY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE FABRICATION. AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE PLATFORM IS THAT THE POROUS ROOFS ALLOW INTRODUCTION OF OLIGONUCLEOTIDES, SMALL PROTEINS, AND DNA-BINDING/DNA PROCESSING ENZYMES, PERMITTING OPTIONAL MANIPULATION AND MODIFICATION OF THE DNA IN THE NANOCHANNELS.

"PRIVACY-PRESERVING CONNECTIVITY FOR RARE-DISEASE PATIENTS - ABSTRACT / SUMMARY SAFEGUARDING PRIVACY OF DATA ASSETS \u2013 WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY FACILITATING DATA SHARING AND EXCHANGE \u2013 IS PARAMOUNT TO SUSTAINING THE VALUE CREATION OF GENOMICS FOR PRECISION MEDICINE AND POPULATION HEALTH. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR XIA-GIBBS SYNDROME (XGS) RESEARCH AND RARE DISEASE STUDIES IN GENERAL IS THE LACK OF INTEGRATED, PRIVACY-PRESERVING PLATFORMS TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT PATIENT RECRUITMENT AND DATA SHARING. RARE DISEASE DATASETS ARE FRAGMENTED, INCOMPLETE, AND SPARSE. THESE BARRIERS TO DATA ACCESSIBILITY PREVENT EFFICIENT DATA AGGREGATION, TRANSLATION TO CLINICAL BENEFITS, AND DISEASE PROMOTION TO THE GLOBAL PATIENT AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT DATA SHARING MECHANISMS THAT ALIGN INCENTIVES WHILE PRESERVING SECURITY AND PRIVACY, FRAGMENTED AND SILOED DATA WILL SEVERELY LIMIT THE VALUE OF GENOMIC MEDICINE IN THE FUTURE. WE AIM TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING COMPONENTS ENABLING A COMPUTATIONALLY FEASIBLE PRIVACY-PRESERVING RARE DISEASE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PLATFORM, EMPHASIZING FAIR (FINDABLE, ACCESSIBLE, INTEROPERABLE, REUSABLE) DATA PRINCIPLES. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL DEPLOY INNOVATIVE CRYPTOGRAPHY TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CONTEXT OF A WEB APPLICATION STREAMLINING INTERACTION, DATA EXCHANGE, AND ANALYSIS BETWEEN PATIENTS, ADVOCACY GROUPS, RESEARCHERS, AND THERAPEUTIC DEVELOPERS. BUILDING ON OUR CURRENT SECURE, HIPAA-COMPLIANT INFRASTRUCTURE, IN PHASE I OF THIS FAST-TRACK PROPOSAL WE WILL ONBOARD OUR EXISTING XGS REGISTRY TO ESTABLISH PROOF-OF-CONCEPT WHILE ENSURING THE PLATFORM IS READILY GENERALIZABLE TO OTHER RARE DISEASES. IN PHASE II, AS WE ONBOARD TWO ADDITIONAL RARE DISEASE COMMUNITIES, WE WILL IMPLEMENT SOFTWARE OPTIMIZATIONS AND GPU-ACCELERATION TO ENSURE THE PLATFORM CAN SCALE TO A DATA PRIVACY- AND OWNERSHIP-PRESERVING ENGAGEMENT PLATFORM AND REGISTRY APPLICABLE TO ALL RARE DISEASE COMMUNITIES AND DATASETS. ULTIMATELY, THE APPROACHES DEVELOPED HERE WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS AND THERAPEUTIC DEVELOPERS EXPANDED ABILITY TO SEARCH FOR AND RETRIEVE ESSENTIAL PATIENT DATA FOR RARE DISEASE RESEARCH.

HOWEVER, ANALYSIS OF THE DATA REQUIRES COMPUTATIONAL EXPERTISE THAT MANY BIOLOGISTS DO NOT POSSESS. HENCE, WHEN DEALING WITH GENOMICS DATA, MAJORITY OF BIOLOGISTS REQUIRE THE HELP OF BIOINFORMATICIANS EVEN FOR SIMPLE TASKS. THIS PLACES THESE EXCITING METHODS BEYOND THE REACH OF THE MAJORITY OF LIFE SCIENTISTS.  THIS PHASE II PROPOSAL FROM DATIRIUM, LLC, A START-UP FROM CINCINNATI, OH FOLLOWS PHASE I PROJECT THAT RESULTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROTOTYPE (MVP) OF SCIDAP (SCIENTIFIC DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM), A NOVEL MULTI- OMICS USER-FRIENDLY DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS BIOLOGISTS TO ANALYZE THE DATA AND ENABLES COLLABORATION WITH BIOINFORMATICIANS. THE CURRENT PHASE II PROPOSAL DESCRIBES A PLAN TO CONTINUE SCIDAP DEVELOPMENT.  THE KEY PROBLEM FOR CREATING USER-FRIENDLY DATA ANALYSIS PACKAGES IS THE DIFFICULTY IN ADDING NEW OR MODIFYING EXISTING PIPELINES: DUE TO THE TIGHT COUPLING BETWEEN PIPELINE AND USER INTERFACE THIS REQUIRED CHANGES AT ALL LEVELS OF SOFTWARE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SAME LIMITATION EXISTS FOR ALL USER-FRIENDLY BIOINFORMATICS TOOLS. GIVEN THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 150 NGS-BASED METHODS AND MANY WAYS TO PROCESS THE DATA, THIS EXPLAINS WHY A UNIVERSAL AND USER-FRIENDLY DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM DOES NOT YET EXIST.  WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT WE CAN CREATE A DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM THAT IS BOTH UNIVERSAL AND USER-FRIENDLY BY INCLUDING INTERFACE INSTRUCTIONS INTO COMPUTATIONAL PIPELINES. PLATFORM WILL USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE A GRAPHICAL INTERFACE. SPECIFICALLY, WE ARE USING CONTAINERIZED PIPELINES DEVELOPED USING COMMON WORKFLOW LANGUAGE (CWL) MAKING OUR PIPELINES BOTH PORTABLE AND REPRODUCIBLE. ON TOP OF CWL, DATIRIUM DEVELOPED A SYSTEM OF CWL EXTENSIONS THAT ALLOWS TO DESCRIBE THE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS VISUALIZATIONS WITHIN THE CWL WORKFLOWS. IMPORTANTLY, OUR PLATFORM WILL INCREASE THE RIGOR OF COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS BY (I) MAKING THE ANALYSIS REPRODUCIBLE AND AUDITABLE BY BIOINFORMATICIANS DUE TO CWL PIPELINE PORTABILITY AND RECORDING EACH STEP OF THE ANALYSIS AS RESEARCH OBJECTS; (II) ENABLING COLLABORATION BETWEEN EXPERIMENTALISTS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGISTS BY PROVIDING BIOINFORMATICIANS WITH A WAY TO DIRECT ANALYSIS FLOW AND BIOLOGISTS WITH THE CONVENIENCE OF GUI; (III) INCLUDING OUT OF THE BOX PIPELINES WITH OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS AND ACTIONABLE QC METRICS THAT FLAG POSSIBLE ISSUES.  IN THE FIRST AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL DEVELOP A VERSION OF SCIDAP FOR USE ON ACADEMIC CLUSTERS AND COMMERCIAL CLOUDS. IN THE SECOND AIM, IN COLLABORATION WITH DR. SALOMONIS AT CCHMC, WE WILL ADOPT PIPELINES MIRNA, WGS/WXS AND SCMULTIOME DATA ANALYSIS. IN THE THIRD, WE WILL DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO SCIDAP INTERFACE THAT WILL INCREASE SCIDAP FLEXIBILITY AND USABILITY FOR BIOINFORMATICIANS AND EXPERIMENTALISTS.

DESPITE THE INCREASING RELEVANCE OF GENOMICS TO PEOPLE'S EVERYDAY LIVES, GENOMICS LITERACY IN THE UNITED STATES REMAINS LOW. IN ADDITION, THE GENOMICS WORKFORCE IN THE UNITED STATES IS STILL FAR FROM ACHIEVING THE NHGRL'S STRATEGIC VISION WITH RESPECT TO DIVERSITY. TO ADDRESS THESE SOCIETAL NEEDS, IT IS CRITICAL TO EXPOSE PEOPLE TO GENOMICS CAREERS AND EDUCATE THEM ON RELATED TOPICS WHILE THEY CONTEMPLATE FUTURE CAREER PATHWAYS. TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF SUCH AN EFFORT, STUDENTS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL NEED ACCESS TO A HIGHER-QUALITY GENOMICS EDUCATION TO SEED THEIR INTEREST IN PURSUING GENOMICS CAREERS AND IMPROVE THE DIVERSITY OF THE GENOMICS WORKFORCE.

OF THIS PHASE I STTR PROJECT IS TO ACCOMPLISH KEY MILESTONES IN COMMERCIALIZING A NOVEL SACAS9 NICKASE-BASED SYSTEM (CRD-002) TO TREAT DYSTROPHINOPATHIES IN ORDER TO RESTORE THE PRODUCTION OF HEALTHY, ENDOGENOUS FULL-LENGTH DYSTROPHIN PROTEIN OTHERWISE COMPROMISED BY DUPLICATION MUTATIONS. DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD) IS CHARACTERIZED BY PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE LOSS AND CARDIOMYOPATHY ULTIMATELY LEADING TO DEATH IN THE THIRD DECADE OF LIFE. THERE IS THUS A STRONG RATIONALE FOR MUTATION-SPECIFIC THERAPIES THAT CAN RESTORE ENDOGENOUS FULL-LENGTH DYSTROPHIN IN ORDER TO RESTORE THE ENTIRE FUNCTION OF THE DYSTROPHIN PROTEIN THAT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY CURRENT MICRODYSTROPHIN GENE REPLACEMENT THERAPY. DUPLICATION MUTATIONS ARE IDEAL CANDIDATES FOR MUTATION-SPECIFIC CORRECTION AS THEY ARE AMENABLE TO FULL-LENGTH GENE RESTORATION BY REMOVAL OF DUPLICATED EXONS TO RESTORE THE NORMAL READING FRAME. PATHOGENIC DUPLICATIONS UNDERLIE 10% TO 15% OF DMD MUTATIONS, BUT THERE IS NO SPECIFIC THERAPY FOR DUPLICATION MUTATIONS DOWNSTREAM OF EXON 5. THE LEK LAB DEVELOPED A NOVEL SINGLE NICKASE APPROACH THAT EFFICIENTLY REMOVES DMD DUPLICATIONS AT IN VITRO EFFICIENCIES COMPARABLE TO NUCLEASE APPROACHES. IMPORTANTLY, NICKASE PRODUCES A SCARLESS EDIT AT THE TARGET SITE, WHEREAS NUCLEASES PRODUCE A CHARACTERISTIC INSERTION/DELETION MUTATION. THE NOVEL EXON 18-30 TANDEM DUPLICATION MOUSE MODEL FOR DMD (DUP18-30), PROVIDES A VALUABLE TOOL TO TEST DMD HUMAN THERAPIES. SEQUENCES IN DMD EXONS 18-30 THAT ARE SHARED BETWEEN THE HUMAN AND MOUSE GENES WILL BE TARGETED WITH THIS NOVEL NICKASE STRATEGY TO INDUCE A SCARLESS EDIT THAT RESTORES THE GENE SEQUENCE WITHOUT INTRODUCING FRAMESHIFTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PHASE I STTR PROJECT IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE EFFICACY AND PHARMACOLOGY OF THE NOVEL SINGLE- GUIDE NICKASE STRATEGY TO REMOVE DUPLICATIONS USING HUMAN-MOUSE COMPATIBLE TARGETS FOR DIRECT CLINICAL TRANSLATION. MYOS, INC., DEVELOPS AND COMMERCIALIZES NOVEL BIOMEDICAL THERAPEUTICS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. THIS STTR PROJECT IS A COLLABORATION WITH MONKOL LEK, PH.D. OF YALE UNIVERSITY TO OPTIMIZE THE CRD- 002 CRISPR NICKASE APPROACH. AIM 1 IS TO CHARACTERIZE HUMAN-MOUSE COMPATIBLE EDITING TARGETS TO IDENTIFY LEAD CANDIDATE FOR IN VIVO VALIDATION. THIS WORK WILL ASSESS THE IN VITRO EDITING EFFICIENCY OF THREE CANDIDATE CRISPR GUIDES IN HUMAN AND MOUSE CELL LINES, AND WILL VALIDATE THE PREDICTED TARGET SITES AND CHARACTERIZE OFF- TARGET EFFECTS. AIM 2 IS TO PERFORM A FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CRD-002 IN THE DUP18-30 MOUSE MODEL. CRD- 002 PACKAGED IN RAAV9 WILL BE INJECTED SYSTEMICALLY INTO DUP18-30 MICE FOLLOWED BY MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF THE SPLICE SITE, ANALYSIS OF DMD PROTEIN SEQUENCE, AND FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF MUSCLE STRUCTURE. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING CRD-002 TO RESTORE FULL-LENGTH DYSTROPHIN PROTEIN.

GWAS HAS ARGUABLY BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TOOL IN THIS SO CALLED \u201cPOST-GENOMIC\u201d ERA, YIELDING ALMOST 200,000 ROBUST ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN COMMON SNPS AND MORE THAN 5,000 HUMAN TRAITS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM, GWAS ONLY REPORT GENOMIC \u201cSIGNALS\u201d OR \u201cLOCI\u201d TAGGED BY INDEX SNPS AND NOT THE UNDERLYING TRUE CAUSAL VARIANTS. EVEN MORE CRUCIALLY, GWAS CANNOT INDICATE THE EFFECTOR GENES AT THESE LOCI, WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO TRANSLATE THESE FINDINGS INTO DEVELOPMENT OF NEW THERAPIES FOR DISEASE. THE MAIN CHALLENGES TO IDENTIFYING CAUSAL VARIANTS AND EFFECTOR GENES ARE THAT 1) THE MAJORITY OF VARIANTS IDENTIFIED BY GWAS RESIDE IN NON-CODING REGIONS OF THE GENOME AND ARE THOUGHT TO REGULATE GENE EXPRESSION, OFTEN HUNDREDS OF KB AWAY IN LINEAR DISTANCE AND 2) GENE EXPRESSION REGULATION IS EXQUISITELY TISSUE AND CELL TYPE SPECIFIC. WHILE CONSORTIA SUCH AS ENCODE AND GTEX HAVE ALREADY BUILT HIGH QUALITY, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE GENOME-WIDE DATASETS FOR MANY EPIGENETIC MARKERS AND GENE EXPRESSION IN DIFFERENT TISSUES AND CELL TYPES, SOME LIMITATIONS EXIST SUCH AS THE NUMBER AND HETEROGENEITY OF CELL AND TISSUE TYPES AVAILABLE, THE USE OF POST-MORTEM SAMPLES, AND THE LIMITED POWER DUE TO THE LARGE SAMPLE NUMBER NEEDED FOR QTL STUDIES.

INTEGRAL TO THE PRACTICE OF GENOME INTERPRETATION IS THE COLLECTION OF MULTIPLE LINES OF EVIDENCE FROM KNOWLEDGEBASES TO SUPPORT OR REFUTE THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF EVALUATED VARIANTS. MODERN CLINICAL VARIANT KNOWLEDGEBASES MAINTAIN LITERATURE AND VARIANT COVERAGE THAT IS MOSTLY NON-OVERLAPPING. THIS DIVERSITY OF CONTENT CAUSES A KNOWN PROBLEM IN GENOME INTERPRETATION: ANALYSTS TASKED WITH ASSEMBLING A CLINICAL VARIANT REPORT CHOOSE TO SPEND CONSIDERABLE TIME NAVIGATING MULTIPLE RESOURCES AND COLLATING EVIDENCE, OR RISK MISSING CRITICAL INFORMATION BY SELECTIVELY EVALUATING FEWER RESOURCES. THE RESULTING EFFORT NEEDED FOR AN ANALYST TO CLINICALLY INTERPRET A VARIANT LIST IS KNOWN AS THE INTERPRETATION BOTTLENECK, FOR ITS RATE-LIMITING ROLE IN THE CLINICAL EVALUATION OF PATIENT GENOMES. DATA INTEGRATORS FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE GENOMIC MEDICINE ORGANIZATIONS WORK TO ALLEVIATE THIS BOTTLENECK BY DEVELOPING INTEGRATIVE CLINICAL INTERPRETATION APPLICATIONS FOR USE BY GENOME ANALYSTS.

INDIVIDUAL RBP BINDING SITES CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE, AS EMPHASIZED BY THE RECENT EXAMPLE OF THE DRUG SPINRAZA, WHICH IS AN ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE THAT BLOCKS A SINGLE RBP:RNA INTERACTION IN ORDER TO CURE SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY. RECENT ADVANCES IN GENOMICS TECHNIQUES HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE INTERACTION SITES FOR THESE REGULATORY RBPS AND RNAS, AND WE NOW HAVE CATALOGS OF OVER A MILLION SUCH INTERACTION SITES THAT ARE CANDIDATE RNA REGULATORY ELEMENTS.

GERMLINE GENOMIC DATA ARE PRESUMED TO BE STABLE OVER A PATIENT\u2019S LIFE, BUT THE INTERPRETATION OF THOSE DATA AND ITS CLINICAL UTILITY WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS NEW DISCOVERIES ARE MADE AND TRANSLATED TO CLINICAL PRACTICE. FURTHERMORE, MODERN INTERPRETATIONS OF GENOMIC DATA OFTEN INCLUDE MULTI-STEP PROCESSES IN WHICH ONE INTERPRETATION IS USED TO INFORM ANOTHER. THE TEMPORALLY DYNAMIC NATURE OF GENOMIC INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE (GIK) AND THE INTER-DEPENDENCIES AMONG INTERPRETATIONS MAKE A FORMAL KNOWLEDGE MODEL FOR THOSE DATA ESSENTIAL. EXISTING APPROACHES TO REPRESENT AND MANAGE GIK ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FULLY SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF GENOMIC MEDICINE AND THUS A NEW APPROACH MUST BE DEVELOPED. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE THE GENOMIC INTERPRETATION AND KNOWLEDGE (GENIK) FRAMEWORK FOR CAPTURING INTERPRETATIONS RELATED TO CLINICAL GENOMIC RESULTS AS STANDARDIZED, STRUCTURED DATA. THE GENIK FRAMEWORK WILL: 1) FACILITATE MORE ROBUST INTEGRATION OF GENOMIC DATA INTO EHRS; 2) ENABLE SCALABLE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; 3) ENABLE UTILIZATION OF GIK BY OTHER SYSTEMS; 4) ENABLE CLINICAL, TRANSLATIONAL, AND DISCOVERY RESEARCH; AND 5) ENABLE MEANINGFUL DATA SHARING OF GIK.

DETERMINES THE PROPER EXECUTION OF CELL TYPE-SPECIFIC GENE EXPRESSION AND IS CLOSELY RELATED WITH CELLULAR FUNCTION AND HUMAN DISEASE. A VARIETY OF SEQUENCING-BASED APPROACHES SUCH AS HI-C AND IMAGING-BASED APPROACHES SUCH AS MULTIPLEXED DNA FISH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO CHARACTERIZE 3D GENOME ORGANIZATION AND HOW PERTURBATIONS IN ITS ORGANIZATION AFFECT DEVELOPMENT AND CAUSE DISEASES. HOWEVER, THESE APPROACHES CAN ONLY CAPTURE THE CONFORMATION OF CHROMATIN AT A FIXED TIME POINT AND DYNAMIC INFORMATION IS LOST. IN ADDITION, MANY PREVIOUS DNA LOCUS LABELLING METHODS REQUIRE TEDIOUS EFFORT TO CREATE CELL LINES, CANNOT BE APPLIED TO PRIMARY CELLS, AND CANNOT BE SCALED UP TO TRACK GENOMIC REGIONS OF ANY GENOMIC LENGTH SCALES. AS A RESULT, MANY SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHROMATIN ORGANIZATION, DYNAMICS, AND GENE TRANSCRIPTION STILL REMAINS ELUSIVE. OUR LAB HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED A CRISPR (CLUSTERED REGULARLY INTERSPACED SHORT PALINDROMIC REPEATS)-BASED IMAGING TECHNOLOGY, LIVEFISH, WHICH DELIVERS IN VITRO ASSEMBLED FLUORESCENT RIBONUCLEOPROTEINS (FRNPS) CONTAINING FLUOROPHORE-LABELLED GUIDE RNAS AND DCAS9 TO TILE A GENOMIC REGION IN LIVE CELLS. WHILE LIVEFISH IS POWERFUL IN IMAGING DNA DYNAMICS IN PRIMARY CELLS, IT IS LIMITED TO TRACKING REPETITIVE GENOMIC REGIONS, WHICH GREATLY LIMITS ITS USE. THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP VERSATILE IMAGING-BASED PLATFORMS, TERMED 3D SL-LIVEFISH AND LIVEFISH PAINT, TO TRACK THE DYNAMICS OF ANY GENOMIC LOCUS (REPETITIVE OR NON-REPETITIVE) AND ON ANY GENOMIC LENGTH SCALE. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL EXPAND THE PREVIOUS LIVEFISH APPROACH TO TARGET ANY GENOMIC REGION (INCLUDING REPETITIVE AND NON-REPETITIVE REGIONS) IN A VARIETY OF CELL TYPES INCLUDING PRIMARY CELL WITH HIGH LOCALIZATION PRECISION IN 3D (AIM 1). FURTHERMORE, WE WILL DEVELOP LIVEFISH PAINT TO TRACK GENOMIC REGIONS AT DIFFERENT GENOMIC LENGTH SCALES AND TO TRACK THE DYNAMICS OF THE WHOLE OF CHR21 (AIM 2). SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED PLATFORM USING SINGLE LIVE CELL IMAGING TO STUDY THE CAUSALITY BETWEEN THE 3D GENOME AND GENE REGULATION IN DIVERSE CELL TYPES. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE FIRST DYNAMIC PICTURE OF WHOLE CHROMOSOME DYNAMICS IN LIVE CELLS AT DIFFERENT GENOMIC LENGTH SCALES. OUR WORK IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT WILL ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE GENOME\u2019S STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIP ACROSS SHORT AND LONG TIME SCALES AND WILL BE BROADLY USEFUL FOR MANY LABS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0c13d643-4334-38ed-1952-0db7e2ac5e56-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21HG013133_7529"}, {"internal_id": 158296016, "Award ID": "R21HG012991", "Award Amount": 222375.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-04-17", "CFDA Number": "93.172", "Description": "POST-TRANSLATIONAL PHENOTYPIC PROFILING THROUGH NUCLEOTIDE BARCODE SEQUENCING - ABSTRACT ADVANCES IN DNA SYNTHESIS AND SEQUENCING NOW ENABLE LARGE-SCALE EXPERIMENTS THAT SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLORE HOW SEQUENCE VARIATION AFFECTS MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR FUNCTION.

UNDERSTAND HOW GENETIC VARIATION LEADS TO TRAIT VARIATION AND INTER-TRAIT CORRELATIONS, AND HOW TRAITS MAY BE CAUSALLY RELATED TO EACH OTHER), AND CAN HAVE TRANSLATIONAL IMPACT IN THE LONG RUN (E.G. GUIDE IDENTIFICATION OF MOLECULAR TARGETS OR HELP PREDICT SIDE-EFFECTS IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT). WHILE THE SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDYING PLEIOTROPY OR GENETIC OVERLAP IS WELL-UNDERSTOOD, STATISTICAL METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING COMMON GENETIC BASIS BETWEEN TRAITS ARE STILL LACKING. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR TRAITS SAMPLED UNDER A FAMILY-BASED DESIGN. TO ADDRESS METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES IN INVESTIGATING PLEIOTROPY, IN AIM 1, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL, INNOVATIVE STATISTICAL METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING COMMON GENETIC VARIANTS INFLUENCING TWO POSSIBLY CORRELATED TRAITS. IN AIM 2, WE NON-TRIVIALLY EXTEND OUR METHOD IN AIM 1 TO IDENTIFY RARE GENETIC VARIANTS INFLUENCING TWO INDEPENDENT TRAITS. WE USE ONLY AGGREGATE-LEVEL GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE ASSOCIATION RESULTS (OR GWAS SUMMARY STATISTICS), THUS HELPING PROTECT HUMAN SUBJECTS DATA AND FACILITATING GLOBAL COLLABORATIONS. THE PROPOSED METHODS, WHILE HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO SUBSTANTIALLY OUTPERFORM CURRENT APPROACHES IN THE AREA, WILL BE MORE GENERAL AND DISTINCT FROM EXISTING RESEARCH EFFORTS IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS: APPLICABILITY TO CORRELATED TRAITS (AIM 1; E.G. A DISEASE-RELATED ENDOPHENOTYPE AND A MOLECULAR TRAIT, OR TWO DIFFERENT -OMICS TRAITS), TO TRAITS MEASURED ON INDEPENDENT SETS OF INDIVIDUALS (AIMS 1, 2; E.G. SEPARATE CASE-CONTROL STUDIES ON TWO DISEASES), TO TRAITS SHARING SOME SAMPLES (AIM 1; E.G. CASE-CONTROL STUDIES WITH SHARED CONTROLS), TO STUDY DESIGNS WHERE INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT BE RANDOMLY SAMPLED OR UNRELATED (AIMS 1, 2; E.G. CASE-PARENT TRIO DESIGN), TO RARE VARIANTS (AIM 2), AND OUR OPEN-ACCESS TOOLS WILL ALLOW GENOMICS RESEARCHERS ACROSS THE WORLD TO READILY ADOPT AND APPLY OUR METHODS EVEN IN RESOURCE- POOR ENVIRONMENTS (AIMS 1, 2). SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE AIMS WILL PROVIDE THE BROADER SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WITH NOVEL, POWERFUL AND SCALABLE METHODS, ALONG WITH WELL-DOCUMENTED FREE SOFTWARE, TO STATISTICALLY INVESTIGATE QUESTIONS OF PLEIOTROPY BETWEEN COMPLEX HUMAN DISEASES/ TRAITS ACROSS THE ENTIRE ALLELE FREQUENCY SPECTRUM USING GWAS SUMMARY STATISTICS ONLY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e895f676-c226-223f-b5ed-dda80c2ec73a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21HG012978_7529"}, {"internal_id": 159764059, "Award ID": "R21HG012938", "Award Amount": 438625.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-05-24", "CFDA Number": "93.172", "Description": "PHOTO-FRAGMENTATION METHODS FOR SINGLE-MOLECULE PROTEIN SEQUENCING BY NANOPORE MASS SPECTROMETRY - PROJECT SUMMARY A SINGLE MOLECULE PROTEIN SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY WOULD REVOLUTIONIZE OUR ABILITY TO STUDY BIOLOGY AND TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT DISEASE.

ON THE OTHER HAND, NANOPORE SENSORS OPERATE ON SINGLE MOLECULES AND NATURALLY PRESERVE THE SEQUENTIAL ORDERING OF A BIOPOLYMER, BUT THEY CANNOT DISCRIMINATE THE DIFFERENT AMINO ACIDS.

RNA TO PROTEIN MACHINERY) IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND IS CONTROLLED NOT ONLY BY THE RIBOSOME BUT A HOST OF OTHER ASSOCIATED PROTEINS. ASSIGNING AMINO ACIDS BASED ON THE COGNATE GENETIC CODE IS THOUGHT TO BE EVEN MORE COMPLEX AND POSSIBLY MORE ERROR PRONE THAN THE TRANSCRIPTION PROCESS WITHIN THE CELL. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AMINOACYL-TRNA SYNTHETASES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR ASSIGNING AMINO ACIDS TO AN ANTI- CODON AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EASILY MODIFIED USING FLEXIZYMES BY OHUCHI ET AL. IN 2007. IN BRIEF, WHETHER PROTEIN SEQUENCES CAN BE MODULATED BY THE CELL INTENTIONALLY OR BY UNINTENTIONAL ERRORS, THE TRANSLATION MACHINERY IS LIKELY PRODUCING SUB-POPULATIONS OF PROTEINS PER A SINGLE RNA TRANSCRIPT AND THESE PROTEINS HAVE UNKNOWN EFFECTS ON HEALTH.

THE BASIC CONCEPT BEHIND NANOPORES INVOLVES USING AN APPLIED VOLTAGE TO DRIVE SINGLE-STRANDED DNA MOLECULES THROUGH A NARROW NANOPORE, WHICH SEPARATES CHAMBERS OF ELECTROLYTE SOLUTION. THIS VOLTAGE ALSO DRIVES A FLOW OF ELECTROLYTE IONS THROUGH THE PORE, MEASURED AS AN ELECTRIC CURRENT.

ABSTRACT:  SOLID PHASE SYNTHESIS OF RNA IS AN IMPORTANT GENOMIC TOOL, WHICH OFFERS PRECISE CONTROL OVER THE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE AND OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SITE-SPECIFIC INCORPORATION OF RNA MODIFICATIONS, FLUORESCENT LABELS AND BIOCHEMICAL TAGS. DISCOVERIES OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY CREATED A STRONG NEED FOR A ROBUST SYNTHESIS OF RNA STRANDS, THAT ARE 100-200 NUCLEOTIDES (-NT) IN LENGTH. A MAJOR LIMITATION OF OTHERWISE HIGHLY OPTIMIZED PROCESS IS PURIFICATION, WHICH IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT, LABOR INTENSIVE AND REQUIRES EXPENSIVE HPLC INSTRUMENTATION. AS THE RESULT, SOLID PHASE SYNTHESIS OF LONG OLIGONUCLEOTIDES CONTAINING RNA MODIFICATIONS IS RARELY ATTEMPTED. THIS TECHNOLOGY-DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS LIMITATION BY DEVELOPING A NON- CHROMATOGRAPHIC RNA PURIFICATION METHOD WHICH WILL BE 10-TIMES FASTER AND 2-ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE CHEAPER AND WILL ALLOW ISOLATION OF STRANDS THAT ARE 100-200-NT LONG IN GOOD YIELD AND 98% PURITY.  THE PROPOSED PURIFICATION STRATEGY IS BASED ON BIO-ORTHOGONAL INVERSE ELECTRON DEMAND DIELS-ALDER (IEDDA) CHEMISTRY BETWEEN TRANS-CYCLOOCTENE (TCO) AND TETRAZINE (TZ) THAT ALLOWS TO SELECTIVELY TAG AND PURIFY STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX AND INCREASING LONG RNA STRANDS FROM THE FAILURE STRANDS THAT ACCRUE DURING SOLID PHASE SYNTHESIS. TCO AND TZ ARE HIGHLY SELECTIVE FOR EACH OTHER AND HAVE MINIMAL CROSS-REACTIVITY WITH OTHER FUNCTIONAL GROUPS FOUND IN RNA. THE BIO-ORTHOGONAL CLICK CHEMISTRY IS HIGHLY EFFICIENT, EVEN AT VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF TCO AND TZ. DURING PRELIMINARY STUDIES WE HAVE SHOWN THAT OUR STRATEGY ALLOWS EFFICIENT SYNTHESIS AND PURIFICATION OF 76-NT LONG TRNA AND 101-NT LONG SGRNA WITH YIELDS THAT WERE 10-TIMES HIGHER THAN CONVENTIONAL PURIFICATION METHODS.  DURING THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROGRAM, WE AIM TO IMPROVE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF OUR DESIGN TO BRING THE OVERALL PROCESS TO UNDER 7 HRS, FURTHER IMPROVE THE OVERALL YIELD AND PURITY OF THE ISOLATED RNA. IN AIM 1, WE PROPOSE TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS BY DEVELOPING A NEW PHOTOLABILE LINKER THAT WILL ALLOW FAST PHOTOCLEAVAGE USING VISIBLE LIGHT.

A MAJOR OBSTACLE IN USING THESE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HEALTH AND DISEASE IS THE VAST SCALE OF THE HUMAN GENOME: FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE ~22,000 PROTEIN CODING GENES, MILLIONS OF CANDIDATE REGULATORY ELEMENTS, AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF COMMON VARIANTS. THIS CHALLENGE HAS MOTIVATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF INCREASINGLY REFINED FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS TOOLS THAT ENABLE MANY DISTINCT HYPOTHESES TO BE TESTED IN PARALLEL. FOR EXAMPLE, CRISPR SCREENING LIBRARIES ENABLE EVERY GENE IN THE GENOME TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY KNOCKED OUT, ACTIVATED, OR KNOCKED DOWN, PROVIDING A MEANS OF TESTING HOW CONNECT GENES TO PHENOTYPE. THOUGH HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, THESE APPROACHES ARE IN ONE SENSE RATHER WASTEFUL: QUANTIFICATION USUALLY AMOUNTS TO COUNTING THE REPRESENTATION OF THE SGRNAS MEDIATING THE PERTURBATIONS BY SEQUENCING, MEANING THOUSANDS OF CELLS PER GENE ARE OFTEN USED IN PRACTICE TO ENSURE STATISTICAL POWER. THIS SIMPLE CONSTRAINT MEANS THAT SCREENS ARE OFTEN CONDUCTED IN ONLY A HANDFUL OF CONDITIONS, LIMITS APPLICATIONS TO PRECIOUS CELL TYPES SUCH AS PATIENT SAMPLES, AND MAKES SCALING TO LARGER PROBLEMS DIFFICULT. HERE WE LEVERAGE THE EXPLOSION OF RECENT INNOVATION THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED THE POPULARIZATION OF SINGLE-CELL RNA SEQUENCING TO REVISIT THE TASK OF CONDUCTING CRISPR SCREENS. WE PROPOSE QUANTITATIVE REPORTER SEQUENCING (QRS), A HIGHLY SCALABLE AND HIGHLY QUANTITATIVE APPROACH FOR CONNECTING CRISPR-MEDIATED GENETIC PERTURBATIONS TO THEIR EFFECTS ON AN ENGINEERED PHENOTYPIC REPORTER IN POOLED FORMAT. USING A SIMPLE LIBRARY PREP PROTOCOL THAT REQUIRES NO SPECIAL INSTRUMENTS, QRS ENABLES CRISPR SCREENS WITH SINGLE-CELL RESOLUTION AND ABSOLUTE QUANTIFICATION OF PHENOTYPE. EACH CELL THEREFORE SERVES AS AN INDEPENDENT REPLICATE MEASUREMENT, REDUCING CELL INPUT REQUIREMENTS AND ENABLING THE MEASUREMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS OF PHENOTYPE FOR EACH PERTURBATION RATHER THAN AVERAGE EFFECTS. THROUGH APPLICATIONS WE DEMONSTRATE HOW THIS APPROACH CAN BE USED TO CONDUCT HIGHLY SENSITIVE SCREENS FOR WEAK EFFECTS IN PRECIOUS CELL TYPES, TO EFFICIENTLY QUANTIFY GENETIC INTERACTIONS (I.E.

GENOME SEQUENCING PROJECTS ARE RAPIDLY UNCOVERING NEW GENETIC VARIATION, BUT A LACK OF FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION FOR NEWLY DISCOVERED VARIANTS MEANS THAT MOST ARE CLASSIFIED AS VARIANTS OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE (VUS), EVEN IN WELL-STUDIED PROTEIN CODING GENES. BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM, THE NHGRI 2020 STRATEGIC VISION EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR NEW HIGHLY PARALLEL TECHNOLOGIES THAT ASSESS THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACT OF GENETIC VARIANTS. ONE PROMISING APPROACH IS DEEP MUTATIONAL SCANNING (DMS), IN WHICH LARGE NUMBERS OF GENETIC VARIANTS ARE SYNTHESIZED AND ASSAYED IN PARALLEL. THE LARGE SCALE OF DMS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO KEEP PACE WITH EFFORTS IN VARIANT DISCOVERY.  THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES TWO PROBLEMS THAT LIMIT THE RELIABLE USE OF DMS. FIRST, MOST PUBLISHED DMS ARE INAPPROPRIATE FOR CLINICAL USE BECAUSE THEY SUFFER FROM LOW BIOLOGICAL REPRODUCIBILITY. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THIS PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND EXCLUDE OUTLIER MEASUREMENTS CAUSED BY GENETIC ANOMALIES THAT OCCUR DURING THE TRANSFECTION AND INTEGRATION OF VARIANT LIBRARIES INTO CELLS. WE WILL TEST WHETHER A BARCODING STRATEGY DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO DETECT THESE TYPES OF OUTLIERS IMPROVES THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF DMS. THE BARCODING STRATEGY WILL BE COUPLED WITH AN IMPROVED LANDING PAD SYSTEM FOR GENOMIC INTEGRATION OF DMS LIBRARIES.  ANOTHER ISSUE WITH DMS IS THE CHOICE OF CELL TYPE FOR FUNCTIONAL ASSAYS. FOR MOST DISEASES, THE RELEVANT IN VIVO CELL TYPES ARE INACCESSIBLE. INVESTIGATORS MUST COMPROMISE BETWEEN DIFFICULT PRIMARY CELL MODELS AND MORE TRACTABLE CELL CULTURE SYSTEMS THAT LESS FAITHFULLY REFLECT IN VIVO BIOLOGY. WE WILL ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM FIRST FOCUSING ON DMS OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS (TFS), AN IMPORTANT CLASS OF DISEASE GENES. BECAUSE CELL-TYPE SPECIFIC TFS WORK IN CONCERT WITH OTHER TFS, WE WILL TEST WHETHER EXPRESSING GROUPS OF CELL TYPE-SPECIFIC TFS IN A TRACTABLE CELL LINE ALLOWS US TO PERFORM A DMS THAT FAITHFULLY REPRESENTS THE IN VIVO CELL TYPE. WE PROPOSE TO TEST THIS PREMISE USING THE CONE-ROD HOMEOBOX (CRX) AS A MODEL TF.

TO TEST THE VALIDITY OF THIS SYSTEM FOR A DMS WE WILL DIRECTLY COMPARE RESULTS FROM ENGINEERED HEK293 LINES TO THOSE FROM LIVE INTACT RETINAS.

THIS PROPOSAL IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT SOLVES A LONG-STANDING BOTTLENECK IN THE GENERATION OF CELL LINES WITH PRECISE GENETIC INSERTIONS, OPENING THE DOOR TO THE COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTERIZATION OF PROTEIN FUNCTION. THIS WORK IS SIGNIFICANT AS IT REPRESENTS A TWO ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IMPROVEMENT IN SCALABILITY OVER THE STATE OF THE ART, AND HAS IMMEDIATE APPLICATIONS IN THE GENERATION OF DESIGNER CELL LINES.

EACH WITH A DIFFERENT ENDOGENOUS PROTEIN TAGGED), AT A RATE OF HUNDREDS AT ONCE. THIS WORK WILL EXERT A POSITIVE IMPACT IMMEDIATELY BY DELIVERING A READILY ADAPTABLE METHOD FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY TAGGING HUNDREDS OF PROTEINS WITHIN THEIR NATIVE CONTEXT, AND IN THE LONG-TERM BY ACHIEVING THE ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP TOWARDS ENABLING THE PARALLEL INTERROGATION OF PROTEIN FUNCTION EN MASSE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "5f6a3877-304a-f4ec-9bd4-082c57aa1297-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21HG011855_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140059139, "Award ID": "R21HG011850", "Award Amount": 626327.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-17", "CFDA Number": "93.172", "Description": "TAGMENTATION-BASED INDEXING FOR METHYLATION SEQUENCING AS A NOVEL METHOD OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT METHYLATION CLOCK MEASUREMENT - PROJECT SUMMARY DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EPIGENETIC CLOCK IN EPIGENOMICS RESEARCH AND TO HUMAN HEALTH, METHODS TO MEASURE METHYLATION AGE REMAIN FOR THE MOST PART EXPENSIVE AND NOT AMENABLE TO HIGH THROUGHPUT ASSAYS.

TWO GOALS OF GENOMIC DATA ANALYSIS IN MEDICINE ARE TO IDENTIFY GENOMIC BIOMARKERS OF CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND TO BUILD GENOMIC BIOMARKER-BASED PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR DISEASE PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS. BOTH OF THESE TASKS FACE THE CHALLENGE OF INSUFFICIENT STATISTICAL POWER. FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS STUDIES HAVE PRODUCED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DATA ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE GENOMIC ELEMENTS. INTEGRATING SUCH AUXILIARY DATA IN THE ANALYSIS OF GENOMIC DATA COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE POWER AND INTERPRETABILITY OF THE ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, METHODS FOR INTEGRATION OF AUXILIARY DATA IN GENOMIC DATA ANALYSIS REMAIN UNDER-DEVELOPED. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO DEVELOP NOVEL STATISTICAL METHODS FOR AUXILIARY DATA INTEGRATION FOR THREE FUNDAMENTAL STATISTICAL PROBLEMS. AIM 1 FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING A COVARIATE-ADAPTIVE FAMILY-WISE ERROR RATE CONTROL PROCEDURE INTEGRATING AUXILIARY DATA. THE PROCEDURE IMPROVES OVER EXISTING PROCEDURES BY ACCOUNTING FOR THE AUXILIARY INFORMATION AND THE P-VALUE DISTRIBUTIONAL INFORMATION SIMULTANEOUSLY WHILE THE EXISTING PROCEDURES DO NOT USE THE P-VALUE DISTRIBUTIONAL INFORMATION. AIM 2 FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING A STRUCTURE-ADAPTIVE HIGH-DIMENSIONAL REGRESSION MODEL FOR FLEXIBLE INTEGRATION OF AUXILIARY DATA INTO PREDICTION. THE METHOD TRANSLATES THE AUXILIARY INFORMATION INTO DIFFERENT PENALIZATION STRENGTHS FOR THE REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS. SINCE IT IMPOSES A \u201cSOFT\u201d CONSTRAINT ON THE REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS, IT IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE ROBUST TO MIS-SPECIFIED OR LESS INFORMATIVE AUXILIARY INFORMATION. AIM 3 PROPOSES A TWO-STAGE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE CONTROL (FDR) PROCEDURE FOR MORE POWERFUL CONFOUNDER ADJUSTMENT IN GENOMIC ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS. GENOMIC DATA ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONFOUNDING EFFECTS DUE TO DEMOGRAPHIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, BIOLOGICAL AND TECHNICAL FACTORS. CONFOUNDER ADJUSTMENT SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES STATISTICAL POWER. THE TWO-STAGE APPROACH IMPROVES THE POWER OF TRADITIONAL ADJUSTED ANALYSES BY USING THE UNADJUSTED TEST STATISTICS AS AUXILIARY INFORMATION TO FILTER OUT LESS PROMISING FEATURES AND PERFORMING THE FDR CONTROL IN THE REMAINING.

THESE ELEMENTS ARE HARD TO DISCOVER BECAUSE THEIR LOCATIONS AND ORIENTATIONS ARE NOT CONSTRAINED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR TARGET GENES. SEVERAL DISEASES AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CERTAIN DISEASES ARE LINKED TO MUTATIONS AND VARIANTS IN ENHANCERS. MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR LOCATING ENHANCERS. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS ARE MORE SUITABLE TO HANDLE THE LARGE NUMBER OF GENOMES BEING SEQUENCED NOW BECAUSE THEY ARE FASTER, CHEAPER, AND LESS LABOR INTENSIVE THAN EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. DESPITE MANY AVAILABLE COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS, WE LACK A SOPHISTICATED TOOL THAT CAN MEASURE SIMILARITY IN THE ENHANCER ACTIVITY OF A PAIR OF SEQUENCES. WE PROPOSE HERE UTILIZING DEEP ARTICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (DANNS) TO DEVELOP SUCH A TOOL. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DECIPHER THE CODE GOVERNING GENE REGULATION WITH THE FOLLOWING SPECIC AIMS: (I) DESIGN A COMPUTATIONAL TOOL FOR MEASURING ENHANCER-ENHANCER SIMILARITY, (II) VALIDATE UP TO 96 PUTATIVE ENHANCERS EXPERIMENTALLY, (III) UNDERSTAND ENHANCER GRAMMAR, AND (IV) ANNOTATE ENHANCERS IN MORE THAN 50 INSECT GENOMES. TO ACHIEVE THESE AIMS, A NOVEL APPLICATION OF DANNS IS PROPOSED. CURRENT TOOLS UTILIZE DANNS TO ANSWER A YES-NO QUESTION: DOES A SEQUENCE HAVE SIMILAR ACTIVITY TO THE TISSUE-SPECIC ENHANCERS COMPRISING A PARTICULAR TRAINING SET OF KNOWN ENHANCERS? THESE APPROACHES REQUIRE TRAINING A SEPARATE NETWORK ON EACH TISSUE, LEADING TO INCONSISTENT PERFORMANCES ON DIFFERENT TISSUES. INSTEAD, HERE WE USE A DANN TO ANSWER A RELATED BUT DIFFERENT QUESTION: DOES THIS SEQUENCE HAVE SIMILAR ENHANCER ACTIVITY TO A SINGLE KNOWN TISSUE-SPECIC ENHANCER? THIS DEEP NETWORK SHOULD PERFORM CONSISTENTLY ON DIFFERENT CELL TYPES BECAUSE IT IS TRAINED ON PAIRS OF SEQUENCES \u2014 NOT INDIVIDUAL SEQUENCES AS IS THE CASE IN THE AVAILABLE TOOLS \u2014 REPRESENTING ALL TISSUES FOR WHICH THERE ARE KNOWN ENHANCERS. THE DANN IS TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE SEQUENCE PAIRS WITH SIMILAR ENHANCER ACTIVITIES AND THOSE WITH DISSIMILAR ACTIVITIES INCLUDING (I) TWO ENHANCERS ACTIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT TISSUES, (II) ONE ENHANCER AND A RANDOM GENOMIC SEQUENCE, AND (III) TWO RANDOM GENOMIC SEQUENCES. THE TOOL OUTPUTS A SCORE BETWEEN 0 AND 1, INDICATING HOW SIMILAR THE ENHANCER ACTIVITIES OF THE TWO SEQUENCES ARE. USING A MUCH SIMPLER MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM THAN DANNS, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT PAIRS WITH SIMILAR ENHANCER ACTIVITIES CAN BE SEPARATED FROM PAIRS OF RANDOM GENOMIC SEQUENCES OR PAIRS OF ONE ENHANCER AND A RANDOM GENOMIC SEQUENCE WITH A VERY HIGH ACCURACY. THE NEW TOOL HAS MANY IMPORTANT POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDING CONSISTENT ANNOTATION OF ENHANCERS ACROSS CELL TYPES AND RELATED SPECIES. OUR TOOL CAN ANNOTATE ENHANCERS ACTIVE IN A CELL TYPE THAT HAS A SMALL NUMBER OF KNOWN ENHANCERS, AND IT CAN ANNOTATE ENHANCERS IN RELATED GENOMES WHEN THERE IS A SET OF KNOWN ENHANCERS DEMARCATED IN ONE OF THEM.

BECAUSE OF THEIR REPETITIVE NATURE, THEY HAVE BEEN HARD TO MEASURE WITH SHORT READ SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES AND ANY WHOLE- GENOME, LONG-READ SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN TOO COSTLY TO APPLY. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE BUILD ON THE TECHNOLOGY OF OUR PARENT GRANT TO CAPTURE A SET OF ACTIVELY MOVING TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS: L1HS, ALUYA5/8, ALUYB8/9, AND SVAS. THESE REPRESENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF ACTIVE TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS AND THUS WILL ALLOW US TO MEASURE THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF POLYMORPHIC INSERTIONS OF THESE ELEMENTS. AFTER CAPTURE, WE WILL USE NANOPORE LONG-READ SEQUENCING TO CAPTURE BOTH THE ENTIRE INSERTION AS WELL AS THOUSANDS OF BASES OF SURROUNDING SEQUENCE WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR ACCURATE MAPPING OF THESE ELEMENTS TO THE GENOME. WE WILL APPLY THIS TECHNOLOGY TO MULTIPLE REGIONS FROM 30 AD BRAINS TO ALLOW FOR FOLLOW-UP ANALYSIS OF THE ENRICHMENT AND EFFECT OF TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS IN AD.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1567efcf-bcdb-61b9-72f2-70cbed5fa626-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21HG011493_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110024961, "Award ID": "R21HG011424", "Award Amount": 458306.25, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-28", "CFDA Number": "93.172", "Description": "OPTICAL GENOME MAPPING (OGM) FOR CONCURRENT GENETIC AND EPIGENETIC DIAGNOSIS OF INBORN DISORDERS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "cf018231-59a5-d301-ae96-b0817a8ee227-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21HG011424_7529"}, {"internal_id": 108463215, "Award ID": "R21HG011371", "Award Amount": 400465.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-06", "CFDA Number": "93.172", "Description": "FUNCTIONALLY RELEVANT MAPPING OF HUMAN GWAS SNPS ON MODEL ORGANISMS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f044e52c-101e-349e-69e4-aaa93e72f7ab-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21HG011371_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140660136, "Award ID": "R21HG011337", "Award Amount": 455085.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-22", "CFDA Number": "93.172", "Description": "IMPLEMENTING PHARMACOGENOMICS IN DIVERSE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS - PROJECT SUMMARY THERE IS A GROWING EVIDENCE BASE TO SUPPORT USE OF GENETIC INFORMATION TO OPTIMIZE PRESCRIBING DECISIONS; HOW- EVER, IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN SLOW RELATIVE TO DISCOVERY. HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS NEED PRAGMATIC TOOLS TO FACILITATE USE OF GENETIC INFORMATION FOR PRESCRIBING BOTH WITHIN AND ACROSS CLINICAL SETTINGS WITH ANTICIPATED GROWTH OF THIS INNOVATION. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO SUPPORT PRECISION MEDICINE TO IMPROVE HEALTH SERVICES AND OUTCOMES AT A POPULATION LEVEL. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS TO USE OR INTEGRATE (I.E., TO IMPLEMENT) GENOMIC INFORMATION WITHIN REAL-WORLD CLINICAL CARE SETTINGS. THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY DETERMINANTS, STRATEGIES, AND CAUSAL PATHWAYS IN COMPLEX, REAL-WORLD SETTINGS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THIS R21 INCLUDES TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) IDEN- TIFY DETERMINANTS AND STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF GENOTYPE-GUIDED PRESCRIBING AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL AND 2) DETERMINE CAUSAL PATHWAYS, I.E., HOW IMPLEMENTATION DETERMINANTS AND STRATEGIES WORK TOGETHER TO AFFECT ADOPTION OF GENOTYPE-GUIDED PRESCRIBING BY PROVIDERS. OUR SAMPLE WILL INCLUDE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE IMPLE- MENTED GENOTYPE-GUIDED PRESCRIBING TO VARYING DEGREES (E.G., BEGINNING PHASE, PREEMPTIVE POLICY) OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH FUNDING. FOR THE FIRST AIM, DATA FROM SEMI-STRUCTURED, IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS (ADMINISTRATORS, PROVIDERS, PATIENTS) WILL BE ELICITED AND INTEGRATED TO OBTAIN THEIR PERSPECTIVES ABOUT FACTORS THAT AFFECT IMPLEMENTATION. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS WILL PRIMARILY DERIVE FROM TWO IMPLEMENTATION DE- TERMINANT FRAMEWORKS, THE THEORETICAL DOMAINS FRAMEWORK (TDF) AND THE CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLE- MENTATION RESEARCH (CFIR). IN THE ANALYSIS PHASE, IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES DESCRIBED BY RESPONDENTS WILL BE IDENTIFIED USING THE EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING CHANGE (ERIC) COMPILATION. FOR THE SECOND AIM, A NOVEL METHOD, CONFIGURATIONAL ANALYSIS (CNA), WILL BE APPLIED TO DATA FROM AIM 1 TO REVEAL WHAT COMBI- NATIONS OF FACTORS MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR PROVIDER ADOPTION OF PHARMACOGENE TEST ORDERS. CNA USES A MATHE- MATICAL APPROACH TO IDENTIFY MINIMALLY NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES, SUCH AS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES, AND DESIRED ENDPOINTS, SUCH AS PHARMACOGENE TEST ORDERS, AND HAS NOT YET BEEN APPLIED TO EVALUATE IMPLEMENTATION OF GENOTYPE-GUIDED PRESCRIBING. QUALITATIVE DATA FROM AIM 1 WILL ADDITIONALLY BE USED TO INTERPRET FINDINGS. THESE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE SELECTION OF IMPLE- MENTATION STRATEGIES AND TAILORING TO DIFFERENT SETTINGS. IN THE SHORT-TERM, THIS RESEARCH WILL ENHANCE TOOLS FOR IMPLEMENTING GENOTYPE-GUIDED PRESCRIBING THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE NIH CONSORTIUM IMPLEMENTING GENOMICS INTO PRACTICE (IGNITE). IN THE LONGER-TERM IT WILL PROVIDE FOUNDATIONAL INFORMATION FOR AN IMPLEMENTA- TION TRIAL, IN WHICH WE COULD ASSESS RELATIVE COSTS AND EFFECTS OF PROTOCOLS FOR IMPLEMENTING GENOTYPE-GUIDED PRESCRIBING UNDER VARYING CONDITIONS.

THE PLATFORM\u2019S FLEXIBILITY AND LOW BARRIER TO ENTRY MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE FOR REMOTE LOCATIONS, FOR RAPID ANALYSIS DURING DISEASE OUTBREAKS, AND FOR ROUTINE SEQUENCING IN LABORATORIES THAT DO NOT HAVE EASY ACCESS TO, OR THE NEED FOR, LARGE-SCALE CENTRALIZED SEQUENCING RESOURCES. HOWEVER, NANOPORE SEQUENCING IS BIASED TOWARDS SHORT DNA OWING TO TRANSPORT LIMITATIONS IN THE DEVICE. THE POLYDISPERSITY OF THE INITIAL MOLECULAR WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION OF THE DOUBLE-STRANDED DNA (DSDNA) BECOMES CRUCIAL AND TYPICALLY DETERMINES THE READ LENGTHS. ACHIEVING LONG READ LENGTHS REQUIRES CONTROLLED BREAKAGE OF MEGABASE GENOMIC DSDNA INTO SMALLER FRAGMENTS WITH NARROW SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS WITH A HIGH AVERAGE MOLECULAR WEIGHT. THE PREFERRED APPROACH IS FLOW-BASED SCISSION, WHICH YIELDS SEQUENCE-INDEPENDENT BREAK POINTS WITH LOW DNA DAMAGE. THE STATE-OF-THE-ART, DEVELOPED 20 YEARS AGO, PUMPS THE DSDNA MANY TIMES THROUGH A CONTRACTION, WITH COMMERCIAL DEVICES PRODUCING 90% OF THE MOLECULES WITHIN A FACTOR OF 2X OF THE TARGET WEIGHT. OTHER COMMONLY USED APPROACHES INCLUDE MULTIPLE PASSES THROUGH A SYRINGE NEEDLE, WHICH RESULTS IN POORLY CONTROLLED IN MOLECULAR WEIGHT DISTRIBUTIONS, OR CENTRIFUGATION IN A G-TUBE, WHICH ONLY ACCESSES LOWER MOLECULAR WEIGHTS. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON THE STATE-OF-THE-ART FOR DSDNA SCISSION FOR NANOPORE SEQUENCING SAMPLE PREPARATION, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE TARGET MOLECULAR WEIGHTS AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE DISTRIBUTION ABOUT THAT TARGET WEIGHT. THIS EXPLORATORY R21 PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE UNMET NEED IN NANOPORE SEQUENCING FOR DNA SAMPLES WITH A NARROW DISTRIBUTION ABOUT A TUNABLE TARGET MOLECULAR WEIGHT. MEETING THIS NEED WOULD ALLOW USERS TO BALANCE THEIR RELATIVE DESIRE FOR THROUGHPUT VERSUS READ LENGTH, WHILE ACHIEVING READ-LENGTH REPRODUCIBILITY BETWEEN SEQUENCING RUNS. THE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE A PROTOTYPE DEVICE AND PROTOCOLS THAT TARGET MOLECULAR WEIGHTS OF 30 KILOBASES (FOR STANDARD NANOPORE SEQUENCING), 70 KILOBASES (FOR LONG-READ SEQUENCING), AND 100 KILOBASES (FOR ULTRA-LONG READ SEQUENCING), WITH AT LEAST 95% OF THE MOLECULES WITHIN 1.5X OF THE TARGET WEIGHT AND < 10% VARIATION BETWEEN RUNS. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF USING FLOW TO PROVIDE A RELATIVELY SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE DEVICE WITH UNPRECEDENTED TUNABILITY OF THE TARGET DNA MOLECULAR WEIGHT AND AN EXCEPTIONALLY NARROW SIZE DISTRIBUTION COMPARED TO THE STATE-OF-THE-ART. THIS PROJECT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE A NEW TOOL IN THE NANOPORE SEQUENCING PIPELINE, COMPLEMENTING ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SEQUENCING TECHNIQUE ITSELF BY ADDRESSING A CRITICAL NEED IN SAMPLE PREPARATION.

MOST OF THE GENETIC VARIANTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE LIE WITHIN NON-CODING DNA AND ARE THOUGHT TO AFFECT GENE REGULATION. THIS HAS INSPIRED EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY VARIANTS THAT AFFECT GENE EXPRESSION LEVELS (EQTLS) IN A WIDE RANGE OF ADULT TISSUES. HOWEVER, MOST DISEASE-ASSOCIATED SNPS \u2013 THOUGH THEY ARE LOCATED IN PUTATIVELY REGULATORY REGIONS \u2013 HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND TO BE EQTLS. ONE REASON FOR THIS COULD BE THAT DESPITE LARGE-SCALE EFFORTS TO MAP EQTLS IN DIVERSE SETS OF TISSUES (E.G, GTEX), WE STILL HAVE NOT YET EXAMINED GENE REGULATION IN THE CELL TYPES OR STATES MOST RELEVANT FOR DISEASE. MANY HUMAN TISSUES AND CELL TYPES, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE PRESENT IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT, ARE INACCESSIBLE DUE TO PRACTICAL OR ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS. THUS, THE PACE OF GENETIC DISCOVERY IS FUNDAMENTALLY LIMITED BY ACCESS TO RELEVANT HUMAN TISSUES. THE DISCOVERY THAT MATURE HUMAN CELLS CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO STEM CELLS WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS (IPSCS) PROVIDE A RENEWABLE SOURCE OF HUMAN TISSUE THAT CAN, IN THEORY, DEVELOP INTO ANY CELL TYPE. IN PRACTICE, HOWEVER, IT CAN TAKE YEARS TO DISCOVER HOW TO PRODUCE ANY SINGLE TISSUE FROM IPSCS USING DIRECTED DIFFERENTIATION. AT THE NEXUS OF STEM CELL BIOLOGY AND EMERGING SINGLE-CELL TECHNOLOGIES, THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE AND STUDY MANY, OR EVEN MOST, HUMAN CELL TYPES SIMULTANEOUSLY, ALL WITHIN A SINGLE DISH. WHEN GROWN IN THE PROPER CONDITIONS, STEM CELLS FORM SPONTANEOUSLY DIFFERENTIATING ORGANOIDS KNOWN AS EMBRYOID BODIES (EBS). CELLS WITHIN EBS DIFFERENTIATE ASYNCHRONOUSLY INTO CELL TYPES ORIGINATING FROM ALL THREE GERM LAYERS, INCLUDING PLURIPOTENT, INTERMEDIATE, AND MATURE CELL TYPES. BY APPLYING SINGLE-CELL RNA-SEQUENCING (SCRNA-SEQ) TO CELLS WITHIN EBS, WE CAN JOINTLY IDENTIFY EQTLS ACROSS A MULTITUDE OF CELL TYPES, ALL WITHIN A CONTROLLED GENETIC ENVIRONMENT.

OF THE PROJECT CONCERNS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS AND COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR MODELING GENOMIC DATA MOTIVATED BY IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL QUESTIONS AND EXPERIMENTS. THE ANALYSIS OF SINGLE-CELL RNASEQ (SCRNASEQ) DATA PRESENTS SUBSTANTIAL COMPUTATIONAL AND BIOINFORMATICS CHALLENGES. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THE PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL MODEL-BASED DEEP LEARNING METHODS WITH PRIOR BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION CONSIDERED FOR MODELLING SCRNASEQ DATA. THESE PROBLEMS ARE ALL MOTIVATED BY THE PI\u2019S CLOSE COLLABORATIONS WITH BIOMEDICAL INVESTIGATORS. THE PROPOSED APPROACHES ARE DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION FOR IMPROVING BOTH ANALYTICAL PERFORMANCE AND BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETABILITY. THE METHODS HINGE ON NOVEL INTEGRATION OF BIOLOGICAL INSIGHTS AND DEEP LEARNING METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF THE NOISY, SPARSE, AND OVER-DISPERSED SCRNASEQ DATA, INCLUDING ZERO- INFLATED NEGATIVE BINOMINAL MODEL, AUTOENCODER, DEEP EMBEDDING, HYPERBOLIC EMBEDDING, AND REVERSED GRAPH EMBEDDING. THE NEW METHODS CAN BE APPLIED TO TWO IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS USING THE SCRNASEQ TECHNOLOGIES: CELL TYPE IDENTIFICATION AND DISCOVERY VIA CLUSTERING ANALYSIS AND CELL DEVELOPMENTS VIA TRAJECTORY INFERENCE. THEY WILL FACILITATE EFFECTIVE ANALYSES OF THE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT SCRNASEQ DATA SETS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPORTANT ON-GOING STUDIES THAT THE PI IS CURRENTLY COLLABORATING ON, PANETH CELL REGULATION AND REGENERATION OF HUMAN HAIR FOLLICLES. THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP PRACTICAL AND FEASIBLE COMPUTER PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED METHODS, AND TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE METHODS THROUGH REAL APPLICATIONS. THE WORK PROPOSED HERE WILL CONTRIBUTE DEEP LEARNING METHODS TO MODELING SCRNASEQ DATA AND TO STUDYING COMPLEX PHENOTYPES AND BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AND OFFER INSIGHTS INTO EACH OF THE BIOLOGICAL AREAS REPRESENTED BY THE VARIOUS DATA SETS.

INVOLVING MANY TRAITS WITH BIOBANK-SIZED DATA - PLEIOTROPY (I.E., VARIANTS THAT CONFER RISK TO MULTIPLE CHARACTERS) LEADS TO THE GENETIC CORRELATION BETWEEN TRAITS AND UNDERLIES THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANY SYNDROMES. THE IDENTIFICATION OF VARIANTS WITH PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS ON HEALTH- RELATED TRAITS CAN IMPROVE THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF GENE ACTION AND DISEASE ETIOLOGY, AND CAN HELP TO ADVANCE DISEASE-RISK PREDICTION. HOWEVER, MAPPING PLEIOTROPIC RISK LOCI IS STATISTICALLY AND COMPUTATIONALLY CHALLENGING. SCHAID ET AL. (GENETICS, 2016) PROPOSED AN INTERSECTION-UNION SEQUENTIAL TEST THAT ADDRESSES THE STATISTICAL CHALLENGES EMERGING IN MULTI-TRAIT GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION ANALYSES. SCHAID\u2019S SEQUENTIAL LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST (SLRT) IS POWERFUL, PROVIDES ADEQUATE ERROR CONTROL, AND LEADS TO EASY-TO-INTERPRET RESULTS. HOWEVER, THE ADOPTION OF THE METHODOLOGY REMAINS LIMITED BECAUSE THE PROPOSED TEST AND THE EXISTING SOFTWARE DO NOT SCALE TO BIG DATA (HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS, MILLIONS OF SNPS, MANY TRAITS). THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE SLRT THAT ACHIEVES THE SAME POWER BUT INVOLVES COMPUTATIONS THAT SCALE TO BIG DATA. OUR APPROACH ADOPTS THE INTERSECTION-UNION SEQUENTIAL TESTING FRAMEWORK BUT USES A WALD TEST AND AN APPROXIMATION THAT SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THE COMPUTATIONAL BURDEN. PRELIMINARY RESULTS PRESENTED IN THIS GRANT SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED TEST, AND THE BETA C++ IMPLEMENTATION WE DEVELOPED, HAS THE POWER AND ERROR-CONTROL PERFORMANCE OF THE SLRT, IT IS CONSIDERABLY FASTER (BY A FACTOR OF ABOUT 300), AND SCALES TO BIG DATA. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL (AIM 1) CONDUCT EXTENSIVE SIMULATIONS TO ASSESS THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE PROPOSED TEST. (AIM 2) WE WILL INTEGRATE MEMORY MAPPING WITH OPTIMIZED IN-MEMORY COMPUTATIONS TO DEVELOP OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT WILL IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED TEST WITHIN THE R ENVIRONMENT, IN A SOFTWARE PACKAGE THAT WILL SCALE TO BIG-DATA ANALYSIS. (AIM 3) FINALLY, WE WILL USE THE METHODS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPED IN AIM 3, TOGETHER WITH DATA FROM THE UK-BIOBANK, TO STUDY THE GENETIC UNDERPINNINGS OF METABOLIC SYNDROME. THE ADVENT OF BIOBANK DATA HAS OPENED UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITIES FOR MAPPING GENETIC LOCI AFFECTING COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS. HOWEVER, MORE EFFICIENT DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS ARE NEEDED TO UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL OF MODERN BIOBANKS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL: (I) DEVELOP NOVEL METHODS FOR MAPPING RISK LOCI AFFECTING SYSTEMS OF TRAITS. (II) DEVELOP AND SHARE WITH THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE USED TO ANALYZE MULTIDIMENSIONAL PHENOTYPES WITH BIG DATA.

UNLIKE SEVERAL OTHER LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH, PROGRESS IN REDUCING SUICIDE RATES HAS BEEN LIMITED, IN PART BECAUSE OF AN EXTREMELY LIMITED ABILITY TO PREDICT WHICH INDIVIDUALS WILL ATTEMPT OR DIE BY SUICIDE. INDEED, A RECENT META-ANALYSIS OF STUDIES THAT ATTEMPTED TO PREDICT SUICIDALITY BASED ON PUTATIVE RISK FACTORS FOUND THAT PREDICTIVE ACCURACY WAS BARELY BETTER THAN CHANCE AND HAD SHOWN NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER FIVE DECADES. IN THIS CONTEXT, RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN INCREASING ENTHUSIASM REGARDING THE PROSPECT OF USING GENETIC INFORMATION TO PREDICT SUICIDE RISK. IN PARTICULAR, RESEARCHERS HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED POLYGENIC RISK SCORES (PRS), WHICH USE DATA FROM GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWAS) TO ESTIMATE A PERSON'S RELATIVE GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO A PARTICULAR HEALTH OUTCOME (IN THIS CASE, SUICIDE) BY AGGREGATING ALL RISK VARIANTS PRESENT IN THE PERSON'S GENOME, WEIGHTED BY THE STRENGTH OF EACH VARIANT'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE OUTCOME IN QUESTION. EARLY RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT PRS FOR SUICIDE HAVE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTIVE POWER, AND THE PROSPECT OF USING PRS TO PREDICT INDIVIDUALS' RISK OF SUICIDE HAS GENERATED SIGNIFICANT EXCITEMENT AS A POSSIBLE PRECISION MEDICINE TOOL FOR IDENTIFYING PEOPLE IN NEED OF INTERVENTION AND ULTIMATELY PREVENTING SUICIDE DEATHS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT REASONS FOR CONCERN. FOR INSTANCE, IF HIGH PRS FOR SUICIDE ARE MISINTERPRETED IN A FATALISTIC MANNER, THIS COULD LEAD TO HOPELESSNESS AMONG PATIENTS OR PREMATURE RELIANCE ON INTRUSIVE OR COERCIVE APPROACHES TO RISK-REDUCTION AMONG FAMILY MEMBERS AND CLINICIANS. LOW PRS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO FALSE REASSURANCE. PRS COULD ALSO AFFECT TREATMENT-RELATED BELIEFS, PATIENT-PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS, AND STIGMATIZATION OF AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS ABOUT THE PROSPECT AND IMPLICATIONS OF USING PRS TO PREDICT SUICIDE RISK IN CLINICAL CARE, USING SURVEYS AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS OF PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION (AIM 1) AND OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND PSYCHIATRISTS (AIM 2). AMONG THE PARAMETERS EXAMINED FOR PATIENTS WILL BE WILLINGNESS TO RECEIVE GENETIC PREDICTIONS OF SUICIDE RISK AND EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO THE RECEIPT OF SUCH PREDICTIONS; ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF SUICIDE PRS ON SELF-PERCEPTIONS, REPRODUCTIVE DECISION-MAKING, LIFE PLANNING, FAMILIAL AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, TREATMENT-SEEKING, PATIENT-PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS, AND ACTUAL SUICIDE RISK; AND OTHER PERCEIVED RISKS AND BENEFITS. PHYSICIANS WILL BE ASKED ABOUT PERCEIVED CLINICAL UTILITY AND LIKELY IMPACT ON CLINICAL DECISIONS, ALONG WITH OTHER PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND RISKS. WE WILL ALSO CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHYSICIANS, EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF PRS-BASED SUICIDE RISK INFORMATION (I.E., MOCK ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SUMMARIES) ON PUTATIVE DECISIONS ABOUT CLINICAL CARE (AIM 3).

THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO GENERATE POLYGENIC RISK SCORES (PRS) TO STRATIFY INDIVIDUALS BY RISK FOR DIFFERENT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. AS A PREDICTION TOOL, PSYCHIATRIC PRS WOULD LIKELY BE MOST VALUABLE WHEN APPLIED TO INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THE ONSET OF ILLNESS. IN ABOUT 75% OF CASES, THE ONSET OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS OR PRODROMAL FEATURES OCCURS BY EARLY ADULTHOOD MAKING PSYCHIATRIC PRS LIKELY MOST USEFUL FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. PRS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE EARLY IDENTIFICATION, AND LEAD TO ENHANCED MONITORING AND INTERVENTIONS TO POTENTIALLY PREVENT OR DELAY ONSET, AND MINIMIZE MORBIDITY AND RISK FOR SUICIDE, THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE U.S. IN AGES 10\u201324. DESPITE THEIR PROMISE, PRS COULD BE ESPECIALLY PERILOUS IN THE CONTEXT OF PSYCHIATRY, AND OUR PRELIMINARY WORK HAS FOUND THAT PRS ARE ALREADY BEING USED IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY.

THE PREVALENCE OF STROKE IS HIGHER AMONG AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE (AIAN) POPULATIONS THAN IN ANY OTHER U.S. RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP. CHRONIC PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS INCREASES THE RISK FOR HYPERTENSION, AND IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED STROKE RISK FACTOR IN AIAN POPULATIONS. THE PREVALENCE OF STROKE HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS, AND IS LIKELY BROUGHT ON BY CHRONIC STRESSORS INCLUDING HISTORICAL TRAUMA, CULTURAL CHANGE AND ADVERSE SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH, IN TURN, INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF UNHEALTHY BEHAVIORAL COPING RESPONSES (E.G., SMOKING, REDUCED EXERCISE, POOR SLEEP AND OVEREATING). HOWEVER, OUR PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT BOTH STRONG ADHERENCE TO YUP'IK CULTURAL TRADITIONS (ENCULTURATION) AND DUAL ADHERENCE TO YUP'IK AND WHITE CULTURE (BICULTURALISM) ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHIER BLOOD PRESSURE WHEN COMPARED TO YUP'IK INDIVIDUALS ADHERING TO A MORE WESTERN LIFESTYLE (ACCULTURATION).

SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE BENEFITS THAT ADOPTING POPULATION MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS FOLLOWING GENOMIC TESTING CAN PROVIDE HEALTH SYSTEMS, USING HEREDITARY CANCER AS A CASE EXAMPLE. WE WILL REVISE AND RIGOROUSLY EVALUATE TWO POPULATION MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS (WEB RESOURCES AND PERSONALIZED OUTREACH) THAT IMPROVE TIMELY PATIENT OUTREACH AND END-TO-END TRACKING WITHOUT BURDENING PROVIDERS. WEB RESOURCES IS A LOW-TOUCH INTERVENTION THAT LINKS PATIENTS WITH EXISTING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES (E.G., THE FACING OUR RISK OF CANCER EMPOWERED WEBSITE). PERSONALIZED OUTREACH IS A HIGH-TOUCH INTERVENTION THAT CONNECTS PATIENTS WITH A DEDICATED CARE MANAGER TO DISCUSS RISK MANAGEMENT AND PROVIDE CARE REMINDERS. BOTH INTERVENTIONS ARE HIGHLY SCALABLE AND MIRROR POPULATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THAT HEALTH SYSTEMS HAVE USED TO SUPPORT CANCER SCREENING, DIABETES MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER EVIDENCE-BASED CARE FOR DECADES. WE WILL COMPARE WEB RESOURCES AND PERSONALIZED OUTREACH TO USUAL CARE IN A PRAGMATIC HYBRID TYPE-1 RANDOMIZED TRIAL THAT ENGAGES PATIENTS CAPTURED IN HEREDITARY CANCER REGISTRIES WITHIN TWO HEALTH SYSTEMS, KAISER PERMANENTE NORTHWEST (KPNW) AND DENVER HEALTH (DH). KPNW IS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEM AND DH IS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER, PROVIDING TWO HIGHLY UNIQUE EVALUATION SETTINGS. OUR PRIMARY EFFECTIVENESS OUTCOME IS THE PROPORTION OF REGISTRY PATIENTS UP TO DATE WITH RECOMMENDED CANCER SCREENING OVER TWO YEARS. WE WILL COLLECT SECONDARY IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES, INCLUDING THE ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, FEASIBILITY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND COSTS OF HIGH- AND LOW-TOUCH INTERVENTION APPROACHES.

MUCH OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT GENETIC DISEASE IS BASED ON STUDIES OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE A POWERFUL METHOD FOR DISCERNING THE CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GENETIC DISEASE, GENERATING ONE OF THE MOST ENDURING AND USEFUL RESOURCES IN MEDICAL GENETICS: THE ONLINE MENDELIAN INHERITANCE IN MAN (OMIM).

IT IS A VITAL STEP FOR ANALYZING RAW GENOMIC DATA FOR QUALITY CONTROL, PREDICTING MISSING GENOTYPES, VARIANT PHASING, AND FINE MAPPING OF ASSOCIATIONS TO IDENTIFY CAUSAL VARIANTS. WHEN COMBINED WITH SPARSE ARRAYS, IMPUTATION CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE COST OF POPULATION-SCALE AND FAMILY-BASED GENOTYPING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ALL OF US PROJECT WILL RELY ON A CUSTOM GENOTYPING ARRAY, INFINIUM GLOBAL DIVERSITY PANEL, TO DECREASE THE COST OF GENOTYPING MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS.

TO INCREASE POWER, EXISTING WHOLE-EXOME SEQUENCING STUDIES OFTEN AGGREGATE THE RARE VARIANTS (RVS) ACROSS AN ENTIRE GENE TO STUDY THEIR COLLECTIVE EFFECT. PRESUMABLY, WHEN A GENE HARBORS MANY PATHOGENIC RVS, THE AGGREGATION WILL INCREASE THE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO AND THUS THE POWER. HOWEVER, A GENE OFTEN CARRIES MANY MUTATIONS, WHILE ONLY A SUBSET WILL LEAD TO NOVEL OR ALTERED ACTIVITIES. THESE MUTATIONS USUALLY DO NOT DISTRIBUTE UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE ENTIRE GENE OR DOMAIN. FOR GENES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL MUTATIONS ARE LOCALIZED OR CONCENTRATED TO THE SPECIFIC SUBREGIONS, AGGREGATING ALL THE RVS ACROSS THE ENTIRE GENE OR DOMAIN WILL DILUTE THE SIGNAL, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF POWER.

IONIC CURRENTS THROUGH PROTEIN PORES HAVE BEEN UTILIZED TO RECOGNIZE TINY DIFFERENCES IN MOLECULES IN SOLUTION. MOST NOTABLY, ARRAYS OF THOUSANDS OF NANOPORES INTEGRATED IN LOW-COST AND PORTABLE DEVICES ARE NOW CAPABLE OF SEQUENCING DNA AT THE SINGLE-MOLECULE LEVEL. THE MAIN CHALLENGE OF NANOPORE SENSING IS THE INABILITY TO CONTROL THE TRANSPORT OF MOLECULES ACROSS THE NANOPORE AND TO FABRICATE PROTEIN PORES WITH A BESPOKE DIAMETER AND GEOMETRY THAT CAN RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUAL AMINO ACIDS. THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DESIGN A NEW GENERATION OF PROTEIN NANOPORES WITH ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITIES THAT WILL TAKE ON THE NEXT GRAND CHALLENGE OF SEQUENCING SINGLE PROTEINS. IN ORDER TO SEQUENCE PROTEINS, THE DESIGNED NANOPORES MUST UNFOLD A TARGET PROTEIN, CONTROL THE SPEED OF ITS TRANSIT ACROSS THE NANOPORE AND RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUAL AMINO ACIDS. OUR APPROACH IS TO BIOENGINEER COMPLEX NANOPORE-DEVICE THAT WILL UNFOLD TARGET PROTEINS AND FEED THE LINEARIZED POLYPEPTIDE THROUGH THE NANOPORE WHERE SINGLE AMINO ACIDS WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY MODULATIONS OF THE NANOPORE CURRENT.

THROUGH THIS MULTI-PI PROPOSAL, WE WILL DEVELOP PROTOTYPE TOOLS THAT EMPLOY INNOVATIVE PROTEIN-BASED NANOPORES FOR PROBING THE SEQUENCE OF INDIVIDUAL PROTEIN MOLECULES. THE PROTEIN SEQUENCING TOOL IS BASED ON ENGINEERED MSPA, A PORIN FROM MYCOBACTERIUM SMEGMATIS THAT HAS BEEN UTILIZED IN NANOPORE- BASED DNA SEQUENCING. HOWEVER, OUR PROTEIN DETECTION/SEQUENCING TOOL WILL BE ENGINEERED IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS: 1) EACH OF THE PROTEIN MONOMERS THAT COMPRISE THE OCTAMERIC ASSEMBLY ARE COVALENTLY CONNECTED, ENABLING MUTAGENESIS ALONG THIS SINGLE-CHAIN MSPA (SCMSPA) PROTEIN TO CREATE A SERIES OF MUTANTS WITH ASYMMETRIC CONSTRICTIONS AS HIGH-RESOLUTION NANOPORES FOR READING AMINO ACID SEQUENCES (RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED BY NIEDERWEIS AND WANUNU GROUPS), 2) A DNA-PROCESSING ENZYME WILL BE USED TO MOVE SHORT PEPTIDES AND FULL-LENGTH PROTEINS THROUGH THE PORE BY CONJUGATION OF THESE PEPTIDES TO DNA AND ATP-MEDIATED DNA TRANSLOCATION, 3) THE FULL COMPATIBILITY OF OUR SYSTEM WITH DENATURING ELECTROLYTE CONDITIONS DURING PORE EXPERIMENTS WILL FACILITATE THREE CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH ACCURACY PEPTIDE/PROTEIN READOUT IN A SEQUENCE- INDEPENDENT MANNER - PROTEIN UNFOLDING, PROTEIN THREADING, AND A DRIVING FORCE TO STRETCH THE PROTEIN SO IT IS PULLED TAUT AT THE PORE (ALL OF THESE RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED BY WANUNU, AKSIMENTIEV, AND CHEN GROUPS).

NANOPORE SEQUENCING OF INTACT PROTEIN STRANDS OVERCOMES THESE LIMITATIONS BECAUSE THE ~1 NANOMETER-LONG SENSOR DIRECTLY INTERACTS WITH THE PROTEIN STRAND AS IT IS LINEARLY-DRIVEN THROUGH THE PORE BY THE UNFOLDASE MOTOR PROTEIN, MANIFESTING SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC IONIC CURRENT SIGNALS.

THIS IS AMONG THE MOST DIFFICULT GENETIC AREAS DUE TO DIFFICULTIES TO DISCOVER AND THE NEED OF LARGE SAMPLES TO DETECT MANY SMALL EFFECTS. THE U.S. HOLSTEIN CATTLE HAVE THE LARGEST GENOMIC EVALUATION PROGRAM IN THE WORLD WITH 3,852,580 GENOTYPED CATTLE BY MARCH 2021, AND THE NUMBER OF GENOTYPED CATTLE INCREASED AT A PACE OF ~600,000 PER YEAR. AMONG THE GENOTYPED COWS, PHENOTYPIC RECORDS WERE AVAILABLE FOR 43 TRAITS COVERING PRODUCTION, REPRODUCTION, HEALTH, LONGEVITY, AND BODY SHAPE AND STRUCTURE.

WITH METHODS AND COMPUTING TOOLS TO STUDY COMPLEX GENETICS DEVELOPED BY PI\u2019S GROUP AS WELL AS ENCOURAGING PRELIMINARY RESULTS, THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH IS AN UNPRECEDENTED LARGE-SCALE STUDY ON GENOMIC DISCOVERY AND PREDICTION FOR 43 TRAITS MOSTLY WITH ONE MILLION COWS USING COMPLEX MULTIGENIC MODELS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN ATTEMPTED BEFORE, ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE MANY NEW DISCOVERIES, AND HAVE POTENTIAL TO ADVANCE MULTIGENIC KNOWLEDGE TO A NEW LEVEL. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IDENTIFY MULTIGENETIC FACTORS UNDERLYING QUANTITATIVE TRAITS, TO UNDERSTAND HOW MULTIGENETIC FACTORS AFFECT PHENOTYPES, AND TO APPLY MULTIGENETIC MECHANISMS AND FACTORS TO PREDICT PHENOTYPES. SPECIFIC AIMS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  AIM 1: LARGE-SCALE DISCOVERY OF GLOBAL PAIRWISE EPISTASIS EFFECTS FOR 43 TRAITS COVERING PRODUCTION, REPRODUCTION, HEALTH, AND BODY SHAPE AND STRUCTURE BY TESTING FOUR TYPES OF EPISTASIS EFFECTS PER SNP PAIR, ADDITIVE \u00d7 ADDITIVE, ADDITIVE \u00d7 DOMINANCE, DOMINANCE \u00d7 ADDITIVE, AND DOMINANCE \u00d7 DOMINANCE USING MILLION COW GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDY (GWAS) FOR MOST OF THE 43 TRAITS. THESE TESTS WILL IDENTIFY THE MOST IMPORTANT EPISTASIS TYPE UNDERLYING EACH TRAIT, AND CHROMOSOME REGIONS AND GENES WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EPISTASIS EFFECTS FOR EPISTASIS NETWORK WITH UNPRECEDENTED STATISTICAL CONFIDENCE. ALL FOUR TYPES OF EPISTASIS EFFECTS WILL BE FURTHER ANALYZED AS INTRA- AND INTER-CHROMOSOME EPISTASIS EFFECTS TO INVESTIGATE THEIR POTENTIAL ASSOCIATION WITH THE TRAIT HERITABILITY AND RESPONSE TO GENETIC SELECTION. SELECTED CHROMOSOME REGIONS WITH IMPORTANT EPISTASIS EFFECTS WILL BE SUBJECTED TO FINE MAPPING USING INCREASED SAMPLE SIZE AND HIGH SNP DENSITY BY IMPUTING.  AIM 2: EVALUATION OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF COMPLEX GENETICS EFFECTS TO THE PHENOTYPIC VARIANCE AND THE ACCURACY OF GENOMIC PREDICTION. GENOMIC HERITABILITY OF EACH TYPE OF GENETIC EFFECTS WILL BE ESTIMATED AS A MEASURE OF THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE PHENOTYPIC VARIANCE.

NO TECHNOLOGIES HAVE YET MET THIS CHALLENGE, BUT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO DATE HAVE BEEN BASED ON METHODS WHICH TRACK THE REAL-TIME OPERATION OF SINGLE ENZYME MOLECULES OPERATING ON A STRAND OF DNA. OPTICAL APPROACHES TO SINGLE-POLYMERASE IMAGING SUFFER FROM LOW SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS DERIVING FROM THE WEAK PHOTON EMISSION FROM SINGLE FLUOROPHORES (< 2500 PHOTONS/SEC), AND THUS DEMAND BOTH COMPLEX OPTICS AND PURPOSELY-REDUCED BASE INCORPORATION RATES (~1 HZ). NANOPORE-BASED DETECTION APPROACHES OFFER FASTER DETECTION AND HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO TRACK POLYMERASE ACTIVITY AT HIGHER INCORPORATION RATES (~10-100 HZ), BUT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH RELIABILITY ISSUES AND HIGH ERROR RATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STILL-WEAK SIGNAL LEVELS PRODUCED BY POPULAR PROTEIN NANOPORES.  THESE STRUGGLES SUGGEST THAT NANOPORE-BASED SINGLE-MOLECULE SEQUENCING TECHNIQUES WHICH DO NOT DE- PEND ON REAL-TIME IMAGING OF ACTIVE ENZYMES WOULD HAVE SEVERAL IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES.

YET BEYOND PREDICTION OF HEALTH OR MEDICAL OUTCOMES, THE REALM OF `SOCIOGENOMICS' IS DEVELOPING POLYGENIC SCORES (PGS) MEASURING GENETIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIAL TRAITS AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS, SUCH AS INCOME, EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, SEXUALITY, AND OPTIMISM.

MAMMALS EVOLVED FROM A COMMON DIETARY ANCESTOR TO HAVE AN EXTREMELY BROAD RANGE OF DIETS. AMONGST THESE, FRUGIVOROUS ADAPTATION IS OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE, AS FRUIT-EATING AROSE IN MULTIPLE LINEAGES WITHIN PRIMATE AND BAT ORDERS. FRUGIVOROUS ADAPTATION IS ALSO OF GENERAL INTEREST AS DIETS RICH IN SUGAR INCREASE RISK FOR DIABETES AND METABOLIC DISEASE IN MANY MAMMALS, INCLUDING HUMANS. CONVERSELY, FRUGIVOROUS PRIMATES AND BATS CAN EAT LARGE QUANTITIES OF FRUIT/SUGAR WITHOUT APPARENT DISEASE CONSEQUENCES. SUPPORTED BY RECENT ADVANCES IN GENOME AVAILABILITY AND GENOMIC TECHNOLOGIES, WE PLAN TO TAKE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO UNCOVER FRUGIVOROUS MOLECULAR FACTORS BY: 1) CARRYING OUT COMPARATIVE GENOMIC ANALYSES OF PRIMATES AND BATS TO IDENTIFY SEQUENCES THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY ACCELERATED IN FRUGIVOROUS SPECIES COMBINED WITH A WIDE-RANGE OF GENOMIC TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING RNA-SEQ, ATAC-SEQ, CHIP-SEQ AND COMBINED SINGLE-CELL RNA-SEQ AND ATAC-SEQ ON METABOLICALLY PERTINENT INSECT AND FRUIT BAT TISSUES; AND 2) FUNCTIONALLY VALIDATE FRUGIVORY-ASSOCIATED SEQUENCES USING CELL-BASED GENE ASSAYS, MASSIVELY PARALLEL REPORTER ASSAYS (MPRAS) AND SWAPPING THESE SEQUENCES INTO MICE.

WE WILL COMPARE KEY IMPLEMENTATION METRICS AND WILL ALSO CONDUCT SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS IN BOTH PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO ASSESS PGX PERCEPTIONS OF FEASIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY FROM STAKEHOLDERS.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT SHOULD CONTRIBUTE VALUABLE PRELIMINARY DATA TOWARD BOTH THE REAL-WORLD EFFECTIVENESS OF PREEMPTIVE PGX TESTING AS WELL AS THE FEASIBILITY OF STUDYING AND IMPLEMENTING THIS TECHNOLOGY IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED PATIENTS \u2013 AN AREA OF PGX RESEARCH WHERE FEW DATA ARE AVAILABLE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE THIS PROJECT WILL UTILIZE ADDITIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC DATA THAT, WITH ALONG WITH CLINICAL DATA, SHOULD BETTER IDENTIFY PATIENT POPULATIONS MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM PGX TESTING AND ALLOW FOCUSED OF IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS TO THOSE POPULATIONS. ULTIMATELY, WE EXPECT TO HAVE DEVELOPED VALUABLE DATA IDENTIFYING PATIENTS MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM PREEMPTIVE PGX TESTING, PARTICULARLY IN PATIENTS WHO ARE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AND/OR MEMBERS OF RACIAL MINORITIES. THESE RESULTS SHOULD HAVE AN IMPORTANT POSITIVE IMPACT BECAUSE THEY CAN INFORM FURTHER CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS OF PGX AS WELL AS FUTURE LARGE CLINICAL TRIALS OF PREEMPTIVE TESTING, IDEALLY REDUCING HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES IN THE FIELD OF PRECISION MEDICINE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "369ac1e4-8d93-3063-b933-3586dffba549-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01HG011800_7529"}, {"internal_id": 139197561, "Award ID": "R01HG011799", "Award Amount": 2814564.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-08-10", "CFDA Number": "93.172", "Description": "REAL-TIME GENETIC DIAGNOSIS AT THE POINT OF CARE - SUMMARY THE BURDEN ON PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS WHEN COMPLEX DISEASES ARISE CREATES A TAXING TOLL FOR BOTH FAMILIES AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS.

HOSPITAL VISITS DISRUPT PATIENT SCHEDULES, AND ALSO PLACE UNNECESSARY BURDENS ON A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO MAXIMIZE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF THE PATIENTS. THESE COMPLEX DISEASES UTILIZE EXTRA VISITS AND UNNECESSARY TESTING. WE WANT TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM THAT WOULD IDENTIFY PATIENTS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM ACCESSING THEIR EXISTING GENETIC INFORMATION. PHYSICIANS MAY STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND THE CORRECT TIME TO ORDER GENETIC TESTING, AND WITH THE RAPID PACE OF CHANGE WITHIN THE GENETICS FIELD, MANY PHYSICIANS ARE NOT UTILIZING THE GENETIC TESTING THAT IS AVAILABLE AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME. GENETIC TESTING ALSO REQUIRES HOSPITAL RESOURCES FROM A LIMITED POOL OF WORKERS, THUS EVERY PATIENT THAT PRESENTS AS A COMPLEX CASE MAY NOT BE A SUITABLE CANDIDATE FOR GENETIC TESTING. IDENTIFYING WHICH PATIENTS SHOULD BE ACCESSING THEIR GENETIC INFORMATION REQUIRES AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH. AT GEISINGER, WE HAVE A COHORT OF 150,000 PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SEQUENCED AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE THEIR GENETIC DATA. WE PROPOSE STARTING WITH THE PATIENTS CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY CHARTED INTO AN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD TO IDENTIFY PHENOTYPE TERMS THAT WOULD TRIGGER GENETIC RESOURCES TO BE AVAILABLE.

HERE WE PROPOSE A UNIFIED CONCEPTUAL AND COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR QUANTITATIVELY MODELING G-P MAPS FROM MAVE DATA.

THIS JOINT INFERENCE STRATEGY IS MORE COMPUTATIONALLY DEMANDING THAN MOST MAVE ANALYSIS METHODS, BUT IT IS FEASIBLE USING MODERN DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORKS.

THE SV INTERPRETATION GAP IS ESPECIALLY STARK WHEN COMPARED TO THE RECENT PROGRESS MADE WITH SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE VARIANTS (SNVS), WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY THE RELEASE OF LARGE-SCALE POPULATION ALLELE FREQUENCY ESTIMATES FROM GNOMAD. GIVEN THAT VARIANTS THAT LEAD TO CANCER AND RARE DISEASE SHOULD BE RARE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, THE SNV ALLELE FREQUENCY FROM 125 THOUSAND SAMPLES IS AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL METRIC. ALLELE FREQUENCY ALONE CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY PATHOGENIC VARIANTS BY TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NO EQUIVALENT RESOURCE FOR SV.  THERE ARE HIGH-QUALITY SV CALL SETS (SV VCFS) FROM LARGE COHORTS, BUT THESE STATIC LISTS DO NOT MAKE GOOD ALLELE FREQUENCY REFERENCES. SV DETECTION INVOLVES EXTENSIVE FILTERING TO REDUCE FALSE POSITIVES, AND BECAUSE FILTERING IS NEVER PERFECT, REAL SVS ARE INEVITABLY REMOVED MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO DRAW A CONCLUSION ABOUT SVS THAT ARE IN PATIENTS BUT NOT IN VCF. THE SV COULD BE RARE AND ABSENT FROM THE POPULATION OR COULD HAVE BEEN FILTERED.

IN FACT, STIX IS AS EFFECTIVE AS USING CALLS FROM A MATCHED-NORMAL SAMPLE AT REMOVING GERMLINE SVS FROM TUMOR TISSUE CALLS.

WIDELY-USED IN VITRO DNA ASSEMBLY METHODS, SUCH AS GIBSON ASSEMBLY AND POLYMERASE CHAIN ASSEMBLY, REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE HANDS-ON TIME, ARE DIFFICULT TO MULTIPLEX AND SCALE, AND HAVE SIZE CONSTRAINTS ON THE LENGTH OF THE ASSEMBLED PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, ACCURATE LONG ASSEMBLIES FROM DE NOVO SYNTHESIZED DNA ARE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE WITHOUT A HIGH-THROUGHPUT ERROR CORRECTION STEP.

OUR PRELIMINARY DATA DEMONSTRATES THAT SEX AND GENDER-RELATED EXPOSURES INCLUDING SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION AND SEXUAL ASSUALT TRAUMA CAN BE MINED FROM THE MEDICAL RECORD. MOREOVER, WE SHOW THAT THESE FACTORS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ~30% OF THE MEDICAL PHENOME. FINALLY, WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT SEX AND GENDER-RELATED EXPOSURES ALSO MODERATE GENETIC RISK FOR COMPLEX DISEASE. THESE FINDINGS LEAD TO OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT SEX AND GENDER-ASSOCIATED EXPOSURES INTERACT TO MODIFY RISK FOR HERITABLE COMPLEX DISEASES. BUILDING ON THIS PRELIMINARY DATA, OUR FIRST AIM IS TO IDENTIFY AND VALIDATE THE EFFECTS OF SEX AND GENDER-RELATED EXPOSURES ACROSS THE CLINICAL PHENOME. IN AIM 2 WE EMPLOY A GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY APPROACH TO IDENTIFY SEX-DIFFERENCES IN THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF 1,051 CLINICALLY UTILIZED LABORATORY TESTS. FINALLY, IN AIM 3 WE BRING THESE TWO LINES OF INQUIRY TOGETHER TO TEST WHETHER THE CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF POLYGENIC RISK SCORES (PRS) ARE MODIFIED BY SEX AND GENDER-RELATED EXPOSURES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH INCLUDES BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES AIMED AT INVESTIGATING THE GENETIC, CLINICAL, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL RISK FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEX DISEASE IN EXTREMELY LARGE SAMPLES WITH PHENOME-WIDE DATA AND LINKED GENOTYPES.

OUR PREVIOUS WORK IN NORMAL AND DISEASE TISSUES FROM MALES AND FEMALES HAS SHOWN THAT WHILE THERE ARE RARELY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS OR GENE EXPRESSION THAT CAN EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED SEX-BASED DIFFERENCES, MODELING GENE REGULATORY PROCESSES CAN LEAD TO KEY INSIGHTS INTO THE LIKELY DRIVERS OF SEX DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. THIS SUGGESTS THAT BOTH SEX-BASED FACTORS AND EPIGENETIC VARIABILITY LIKELY WORK TOGETHER TO HELP DEFINE RISK AND RESPONSE. THIS OBSERVATION IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT SEX-BASED DIFFERENCES ARE NOT STATIC BUT RATHER EVOLVE OVER THE COURSE OF AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S LIFESPAN, DURING WHICH EPIGENETIC STATE AND HORMONAL REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION LIKELY CHANGE IN RELATED TO GENDER-ASSOCIATED FACTORS. IN THIS APPLICATION, WE PROPOSE TO MERGE THE THREADS OF DNA METHYLATION VARIATION, GENE REGULATORY MODELING, AND SEX-BASED REGULATORY NETWORK ASSESSMENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT DRIVE THE OBSERVED SEX AND GENDER-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN HUMAN DISEASES. WE ENVISION THREE SPECIFIC AIMS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR RESEARCH PLAN, INCLUDING: DEVELOPING TOOLS FOR THE INCLUSION OF SEX CHROMOSOMES IN NETWORK MODELS AND METHODS FOR COMPARING MALE AND FEMALE NETWORKS; REFINEMENT OF NETWORK TOOLS FOR SETTING EPIGENETIC PRIORS AND INCLUSION OF DNA METHYLATION DATA AS A PRIMARY DATA FOR STUDYING SEX DIFFERENCES INFORMED BY GENDER; AND APPLICATION TO DISEASES WITH SEX DIFFERENCES, INCLUDING COPD AND LUNG CANCER AS PRIMARY EXAMPLES. WE EXPAND NETWORK METHODS TO DEVELOP TOOLS TO BETTER INCORPORATE THE EFFECTS OF THE ALLOSOMES IN THE PROCESS OF GENE REGULATION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS WE HAVE DISCOVERED CURRENT METHODS FOR NORMALIZATION OF SEX CHROMOSOME GENE EXPRESSION CAN INFLUENCE OBSERVED GENE REGULATORY INTERACTIONS. WE WILL REFINE TOOLS TO INCORPORATE EPIGENETIC REGULATION INTO OUR SEX-SPECIFIC MODELS, EXPLORING HOW DNA METHYLATION MAY CAPTURE GENDER TO INFLUENCE GENE REGULATORY NETWORK STRUCTURE AND DISEASE RISK.

THESE INCLUDE NEUROSCIENCE AND BRAIN FUNCTION, BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH, AND DRUG DEPENDENCY AND ADDICTION. SIMILARLY, ASPECTS OF CARDIOVASCULAR AND RENAL FUNCTION ARE MORE READILY INVESTIGATED IN THE RAT WHERE THE VOLUMES OF FLUID WITHIN THESE SYSTEMS ARE ON A MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE SCALE THAN IN SMALLER RODENTS. THE UTILITY OF RAT MODELS FOR INVESTIGATION HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INBRED RAT STRAINS THAT HARBOR MEDICALLY RELEVANT PHENOTYPES. SUCH MODELS HAVE DRAWN ON PRE-EXISTING, NATURAL GENETIC VARIATION TO FIX GENOMIC DIVERSITY THAT CREATES TRAITS SUCH AS DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY. THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH MODELS HAS SPURRED GENETIC INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE SOUGHT TO UNCOVER GENETIC VARIATION RESPONSIBLE FOR DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY TRAITS AND TO UTILIZE SUCH KNOWLEDGE TO REVEAL MECHANISTIC ASPECTS OF DISEASE PATHOGENESIS. HOWEVER, RAT STUDIES CAN BE IMPEDED BY THE POOR QUALITY OF EXISTING RAT GENOMIC RESOURCES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RAT GENOME REFERENCE SEQUENCE IS VERY UNDERDEVELOPED COMPARED TO THAT OF HUMAN AND MOUSE. CONTIGUITY OF THE GENOME ASSEMBLY IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER AND GENE ANNOTATION IS MUCH REDUCED. FURTHER, THE REFERENCE GENOME WAS GENERATED FROM THE BROWN NORWAY INBRED RAT STRAIN. THIS STRAIN IS BIOLOGICALLY REMOTE FROM MANY RAT STRAINS USED IN RESEARCH. THE RAT IS RECOGNIZED AS A HIGHLY ADAPTABLE SPECIES. EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGISTS HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF ADAPTATION ARISES FROM STRUCTURAL VARIATION EVENTS IN THE GENOME. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ADAPTATION OF HUMANS TO HIGH STARCH DIETS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF GRAIN-BASED AGRICULTURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH STRUCTURAL VARIATION IN THE AMYLASE GENE. THIS STRUCTURAL VARIATION RESULTS FROM GENE DUPLICATION EVENTS THAT ARE ADAPTIVE IN PERMITTING INCREASED CARBOHYDRATE DIGESTION. THESE DUPLICATION AND OTHER LARGE-SCALE EVENTS CANNOT BE OBSERVED AND UNDERSTOOD SIMPLY BY ALIGNMENT OF SHORT READ GENOME SEQUENCE TO THE REFERENCE GENOME. LONG READS ARE REQUIRED TO CAPTURE STRUCTURAL VARIATION EVENTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROJECT IS TO ADVANCE RAT GENOMICS RESOURCES TO INCREASE THEIR UTILITY TO ONGOING STUDIES OF THIS ANIMAL MODEL. TO DO SO, WE WILL USE PACBIO LONG READ SEQUENCING TO CAPTURE ALL GENOMIC VARIATION (SNP AND STRUCTURAL). WE WILL ASSEMBLE DE NOVO THE GENOMES OF 9 WIDELY USED RAT STRAINS. WE WILL ALSO INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL ANNOTATION OF THE RAT GENOME TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF TRANSCRIPTS AND PROTEINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RAT REFERENCE GENOME USING LONG READ RNA SEQUENCING.

IT HAS BEEN SHOWN RECENTLY THAT SVS CAN DISRUPT THE 3D GENOME STRUCTURE AND DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO PATHOGENESIS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN T-CELL ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA, DELETION OF A TAD BOUNDARY DISRUPTED THE INSULATED CHROMATIN DOMAINS AND ACTIVATES PROTO-ONCOGENES.

HOWEVER, STUDIES HAVE SHOWED THAT CURRENT TRANSCRIPTOME IS INCOMPLETE, WHICH LIMITS THE ACCURACY OF EXPRESSION QUANTIFICATION. AS LARGE-SCALE RNA-SEQ DATA ARE NOW AVAILABLE, AN EFFICIENT AND ROBUST WAY OF CONSTRUCTING TRANSCRIPTOME IS THE ASSEMBLY OF THE FULL-LENGTH EXPRESSED TRANSCRIPTS FROM A SET OF RNA-SEQ SAMPLES, A COMPUTATIONAL PROBLEM KNOWN AS META-ASSEMBLY. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM AND AIMS TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT META-ASSEMBLERS FOR SHORT-READS AND LONG-READS RNA-SEQ DATA. AS PREVIOUS STUDIES, WE HAVE DEVELOPED SO FAR THE MOST ACCURATE SINGLE-SAMPLE ASSEMBLERS SCALLOP (NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY, 2017; FOR SHORT-READS RNA-SEQ) AND SCALLOP-LR (FOR LONG-READS RNA-SEQ). THE CORE OF SCALLOP AND SCALLOP-LR IS THE USE OF SPLICE GRAPH TOGETHER WITH PHASING PATHS, WHICH ENCODE READS SPANNING MORE THAN TWO VERTICES, TO REPRESENT READS ALIGNMENT, AND A NOVEL ALGORITHM THAT DECOMPOSES THE SPLICE GRAPH WHILE PRESERVES ALL PHASING PATHS. THIS DATA STRUCTURE AND IDEA OF \u201cPHASE-PRESERVING\u201d PROVIDES ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS FOR OUR PROPOSED META-ASSEMBLY ALGORITHMS. THE KEY OF META-ASSEMBLY IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SHARED AND COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION IN THE GIVEN SAMPLES. WE PROPOSE TO COMBINE MULTIPLE SAMPLES AT THE SPLICE GRAPH LEVEL.

TO KEEP THE INFORMATION IN INDIVIDUAL SPLICE GRAPHS, THEIR TYPOLOGIES WILL BE ENCODED AS ADDITIONAL PHASING PATHS. THE ENTIRE DATA STRUCTURE IS THEREFORE SPACE-EFFICIENT AND LOSS-FREE, AND CAN BE PIPED INTO FOLLOWING PHASING-PRESERVING ALGORITHMS FOR DECOMPOSITION. WE WILL SPECIALIZE OUR EXISTING PHASING-PRESERVING ALGORITHMS TO HANDLE PAIRED-END PHASING PATHS AND LONG PHASING PATHS. EVENTUALLY, STATISTICAL METHODS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO INFER THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL ASSEMBLED TRANSCRIPT, AND MULTIPLE HYPOTHESIS TESTING WILL BE PERFORMED TO CONTROL OVERALL FALSELY DISCOVERED TRANSCRIPTS. WE ALSO PROPOSE A NEW CONSENSUS-APPROACH THAT LEARNS A DISCRIMINATOR TO AUTOMATICALLY SELECT THE OPTIMAL ALGORITHM FOR DIFFERENT META-ASSEMBLY INSTANCES.

IN THE PAST DECADE, GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS GENETIC VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS COMPLEX TRAITS. THESE DISCOVERIES HAVE INFORMED NEW BIOLOGY AND LED TO NOVEL THERAPEUTICS. YET, MOST STUDIES FOCUSED ON EUROPEAN SAMPLES AND MOST OF THE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED BY POOLING BOTH SEXES TOGETHER. SEX-SPECIFIC GENETIC ARCHITECTURE IN DIVERSE POPULATIONS REMAINS LARGELY ELUSIVE. AS THE NEXT STEP, CONSORTIA EFFORTS HAVE BEGUN TO AGGREGATE DATASETS FROM DIVERSE NON-EUROPEAN POPULATIONS. META-ANALYSIS IS OFTEN EMPLOYED IN LARGE CONSORTIUM STUDIES THERE IS A COMPELLING NEED TO DEVELOP METHODS THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY CONDUCT TRANS-ANCESTRY META- ANALYSIS. TO THIS END, WE WILL DEVELOP A SERIES OF INNOVATIVE METHODS TO IMPROVE THE POWER FOR ASSOCIATION MAPPING, THE PRECISION OF FINE MAPPING AND THE ACCURACY OF POLYGENIC PREDICTIONS IN TRANS -ANCESTRY ANALYSIS. RESULTING METHODS WILL BE APPLIED TO A SERIES OF HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD RELATED TRAITS, IN COLLABORATION WITH A NUMBER OF CONSORTIA STUDIES. THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF OUR STRONG TRACK RECORD OF METHOD DEVELOPMENT IN STATISTICAL GENETICS. WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE METHODS INTO A FEW WIDELY USED TOOLS, INCLUDING RVTESTS, SEQMINER, AND RAREMETAL, WHICH WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT OUR OWN STUDY BUT ALSO OTHER RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD.", "Place of

YET EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS FOR INCLUSION AND ENGAGEMENT IN PMR HAVE BEEN LACKING. DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT MOST ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY DEMONSTRATE CONSENT CAPACITY, PRECISION MEDICINE (PM) RESEARCHERS MAY EXCLUDE THEM, FAIL TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS IN DECISION-MAKING, OR USE PROXY CONSENT WITH LITTLE MEANINGFUL ASSENT. CONSENT OF ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY TO PMR FURTHER RAISES NOVEL CONCERNS, INCLUDING BEST MODELS FOR CONSENT AND HOW TO MANAGE THE RETURN OF GENETIC RESULTS WHILE ALSO ASSURING GENOMIC PRIVACY AND PROMOTING INCLUSION AND EMPOWERMENT\u2014BELIEVED TO BE CRITICAL FOR SUCCESSFUL PMR. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY PM RESEARCHERS FEEL ILL-EQUIPPED TO RESPOND; THEY EXPRESS DESIRE FOR EDUCATIONAL AND PRACTICAL RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THESE GAPS CONTRIBUTE TO ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY BEING UNDERSTUDIED AND CREATE BARRIERS TO GENERATING KNOWLEDGE TO ADDRESS THEIR HEALTH NEEDS. THEY ALSO IMPEDE EMPOWERMENT AND ARE INCREASINGLY ETHICALLY QUESTIONABLE: ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN PMR. THE PROPOSED STUDY EMPLOYS AN ACADEMIC-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO CLOSE THESE GAPS BY: (1) CONDUCTING A NATIONAL, DISABILITY-TAILORED SURVEY WITH ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY TO IDENTIFY PREFERENCES REGARDING DECISION-MAKING ROLE, COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS, GENOMIC PRIVACY, AND NEEDS FOR ENGAGEMENT IN PMR; (2) CREATING A PMR STUDY-ADAPTABLE CONSENT TOOLKIT TO SUPPORT PM RESEARCHERS IN INCLUDING ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY IN PMR AND EMPIRICALLY TEST IT VIA A TEXT COMPLEXITY STUDY AND COGNITIVE INTERVIEWS WITH ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY TO ENSURE UNDERSTANDABILITY TO THIS POPULATION; AND (3) CONDUCTING A SOCIAL VALIDITY STUDY WITH PM RESEARCHERS TO ASSESS THE TOOLKIT\u2019S USABILITY, RELEVANCE, ACCEPTABILITY, AND COMPREHENSIVENESS.

THE ETIOLOGY OF RPL IS NOT WELL CHARACTERIZED: AFTER EXCLUDING THE KNOWN ETIOLOGIES, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF WOMEN WITH RPL STILL HAVE NO IDENTIFIABLE CAUSE. THE FACT THAT RPL IS, IN FACT, RECURRENT SUGGESTS A STRONG GENETIC COMPONENT, HOWEVER THERE IS CURRENTLY A VERY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO RPL. PREVIOUS STUDIES ARE TYPICALLY DEFICIENT IN THEIR DESIGN, LIMITED BY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, INCOMPLETE CLINICAL PHENOTYPING AND/OR THE RECRUITMENT OF SINGLETONS ONLY. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE PUT FORWARD OUR PLAN TO RECRUIT 1000 RIGOROUSLY-PHENOTYPED RPL TRIOS INCLUDING FROM DIVERSE AND UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS ACROSS THE US AND TO APPLY WGS AND SOPHISTICATED VARIANT DETECTION AND INTERPRETATION METHODS DEVELOPED BY OUR LABS TO IDENTIFY PATHOGENIC AND LIKELY PATHOGENIC VARIANTS FOR RPL. WE WILL THEN PERFORM COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATIVE DATA ANALYSES TO DEFINE THE GENETIC BASIS OF UNEXPLAINED RPL AND MAP THE GENES AND REGIONS OF THE CHROMOSOME THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND A SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY. OUR VARIANT INTERPRETATION PIPELINE INCLUDES CUTTING EDGE APPROACHES TO MAP LIKELY PATHOGENIC NONCODING AND STRUCTURAL VARIANTS RARELY ASSESSED IN ANY PREGNANCY LOSS STUDY. WE WILL ALSO PERFORM A PILOT RNA-SEQ STUDY TO ASSESS THE UTILITY OF THIS APPROACH FOR GENE DISCOVERY IN THE PREGNANCY LOSS SETTING. WE WILL FIRST LOOK FOR RECESSIVE PATHOGENIC VARIATION, INCLUDING COMPOUND HETEROZYGOSITY AND THEN TEST FOR MODELS FOR DE NOVO MOSAICISM, MITOCHONDRIAL MUTATIONS, REGULATORY NONCODING VARIATION AND OVERALL MUTATIONAL BURDEN. FROM THESE COMBINED ANALYSES, WE EXPECT TO UNCOVER MANY VARIANTS IN GENES AND REGIONS OF THE CHROMOSOME THAT ARE INTOLERABLE TO FUNCTIONAL VARIATION, WHICH WE DEFINE AS THE HUMAN INTOLEROME. WE WILL BUILD ON OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES TO MAP THE INTOLEROME BY COMBINING I) AVAILABLE DATA FROM ALL CLINICAL STUDIES TO DEFINE THE GENETIC ETIOLOGY OF UNEXPLAINED PREGNANCY LOSS, INCLUDING DATA GENERATED IN THIS PROPOSAL AND IN OUR PRIOR WORK, II) NETWORK-BASED APPROACHES TO PRIORITIZE VARIANTS GENES IMPORTANT FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND PREGNANCY, III) MOUSE (KOMP, DMDD/MGI) AND CELL LINE KNOCKOUT STUDIES IV) RARE AND COMMON DISEASE SEQUENCING STUDIES INCLUDING CENTERS FOR MENDELIAN GENOMICS (CMG), CENTER FOR COMMON DISEASE GENOMICS (CCDG) AND PEDIATRIC CARDIAC GENOMICS CONSORTIUM (PCGC), IV) EMERGING HUMAN PANGENOME STUDIES HPP, AND V) POPULATION-SCALE BIOBANK PROJECTS SUCH AS UK BIOBANK AND ALL OF US.

GLAZER RECEIVED A B.S. FROM MIT IN BIOLOGY AND A PH.D. FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY IN EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS. AS A POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW IN DAN RODEN'S LAB AT VANDERBILT, HE HAS DEVELOPED HIGH-THROUGHPUT METHODS FOR STUDYING CARDIAC ION CHANNELS. HE HAS ALSO BEGUN IN VITRO STUDIES OF CANDIDATE DISEASE VARIANTS DISCOVERED THROUGH BIOBANK GENETICS. RESEARCH STRATEGY: THOUSANDS OF RARE VARIANTS OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE (VUS) EXIST IN MENDELIAN DISEASE GENES. TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY AND IMPACT OF GENOMIC MEDICINE, THE FIELD MUST DEVELOP EFFICIENT, SCALABLE METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING VARIANT ASSOCIATIONS WITH DISEASE AND TESTING THESE VARIANTS IN VITRO. THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON CELL SURFACE TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEINS, WHICH COMPRISE ~20% OF THE PROTEOME AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MANY MENDELIAN DISEASES. AIM 1 WILL USE GENETIC DISCOVERY IN A LARGE BIOBANK TO IDENTIFY NEW DISEASE-VARIANT ASSOCIATIONS, USING A METHOD TO AGGREGATE MULTI-ORGAN PHENOTYPES CALLED THE PHENOTYPE RISK SCORE (PHERS). PHERS SCORES WILL BE REFINED AND VALIDATED FOR ~50 CANDIDATE TRANSMEMBRANE GENE-DISEASE PAIRS. THESE SCORES WILL BE DEPLOYED IN BIOVU, VANDERBILT'S BIOBANK (RECENTLY EXPANDED TO >100,000 GENOTYPED INDIVIDUALS), AND OTHER COHORTS. VARIANTS WILL BE TESTED FOR ASSOCIATION WITH PHERS SCORES TO DISCOVER HIGH-PRIORITY VARIANTS STATISTICALLY LINKED WITH DISEASE. AIM 2 WILL TEST THE IN VITRO FUNCTION OF HIGH-PRIORITY TRANSMEMBRANE VARIANTS USING A MIXTURE OF GENE-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL ASSAYS. THESE STUDIES WILL BEGIN WITH 4 VARIANTS STATISTICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH MENDELIAN DISEASES BY PHERS SCORES, BUT STILL CLASSIFIED AS A VUS. THIS APPROACH WILL BE EXPANDED TO TEST IN VITRO FUNCTION OF ADDITIONAL VARIANTS DISCOVERED IN AIM 1. AIM 3 WILL DEVELOP AND VALIDATE SURFACE-SEQ, A GENERAL METHOD FOR COMPREHENSIVELY MEASURING THE CELL SURFACE TRAFFICKING OF NEARLY EVERY VARIANT IN A TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN. THIS METHOD WILL FIRST BE OPTIMIZED ON A SMALL GENE, KCNE1, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH ARRHYTHMIAS AND DEAFNESS. IT WILL THEN BE EXTENDED TO LARGER TRANSMEMBRANE GENES, INCLUDING BMPR2, A GENE LINKED TO PULMONARY HYPERTENSION. OVERALL, THIS WORK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IDENTIFY MANY NEW PATHOGENIC/LIKELY PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IN TRANSMEMBRANE GENES. VARIANTS WILL BE RECLASSIFIED WITH DATA FROM AIMS 1-3, AND THE CLASSIFICATIONS WILL BE PUBLISHED AND DEPOSITED INTO THE CLINVAR DATABASE. CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING: THIS PROPOSAL TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE APPLICANT'S EXPERTISE IN GENETICS, GENOMICS, AND HIGH-THROUGHPUT ASSAYS. IT INCLUDES MANY NEW TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE RODEN AND DENNY GROUPS AND OTHER COLLABORATORS, ESPECIALLY INVOLVING BIOBANK GENETICS AND NEW METHODS FOR STUDYING TRANSMEMBRANE GENES.

WHILE THE NUMBER OF GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS TO HUMAN TRAITS AND DISEASE IS SOARING, TOOLS TO CHARACTERIZE AND INTERPRET THESE VARIANTS ARE LACKING.

A REPERTOIRE OF WELL-CHARACTERIZED CAUSAL VARIANTS IS NEEDED TO BUILD GENERALIZABLE MODELS WITH WHICH TO UNLOCK INSIGHTS INTO THE GENETIC BASIS OF HUMAN HEALTH AND HISTORY.  NATURAL SELECTION IS A POWERFUL DRIVER OF HUMAN GENETIC VARIATION.

PARTICLES-BASED SPATIOTEMPORAL AND DYNAMIC SINGLE-CELL MULTIOMICS - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CELLS ARE THE BASIC UNIT OF LIFE. CELLS ARE VERY DYNAMIC: THEY CHANGE OVER TIME AND LOCATIONS, RESPOND TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS, AND INTERACT WITH OTHER CELLS. OVER THE PAST DECADE, SINGLE-CELL BIOLOGY HAS WITNESSED ENORMOUS GROWTH OWING TO MASSIVE TECHNICAL ADVANCES, SUCH AS SINGLE-CELL SEQUENCING, MULTI-OMICS, AND SPATIAL OMICS. HOWEVER, OBTAINING DYNAMIC DIMENSIONS OF LIVE CELLS ALONG WITH THEIR MULTI-OMIC INFORMATION AT THE SINGLE-CELL RESOLUTION IS CURRENTLY DIFFICULT AND CERTAINLY NOT POSSIBLE ON LARGE SCALES. HERE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL CELL BARCODING TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENABLE US TO COLLECT LIVE INFORMATION OF CELLS AND CONNECT THE DATA TO THEIR DETAILED OMICS INFORMATION. THIS TECHNOLOGY MAKES USE OF LASER PARTICLES (LPS) WITH UNIQUE OPTICAL BARCODES FOR >100,000 CHANNELS, EACH CONTAINING A UNIQUE DNA BARCODE. THE \u201cDUAL-BARCODING\u201d WILL ALLOW US TO OPTICALLY TRACK LIVE CELLS UNDER A MICROSCOPE WHILE THEY ARE IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT OR IN CULTURE, ACQUIRE THEIR LIVE INFORMATION, HARVEST THE CELLS, ACQUIRE THE OMICS INFORMATION OF THE SAME CELLS BY DROPLET-BASED NEXT-GENERATION SINGLE-CELL SEQUENCING, AND THEN COMBINE THE LIVE IMAGING AND OMICS DATA AT THE SINGLE CELL RESOLUTION. FURTHERMORE, OUR TECHNIQUE CAN BE UPGRADED TO MULTI-OMICS MODALITIES, COMBINING MULTIPLE LAYERS OF INFORMATION FROM THE GENOME, EPIGENOME, TRANSCRIPTOME, AND PROTEOME, TOGETHER WITH MORPHOLOGICAL, LOCATIONAL, FUNCTIONAL, AND BEHAVIORAL DATA.

MISSING OBSERVATIONS ACROSS TECHNOLOGIES AND BIOLOGICAL STATES IS A FREQUENTLY OBSERVED PROBLEM IN THE FIELD OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY. THIS MISSINGNESS CAN BE A RESULT OF LIMITATIONS IN THE TECHNOLOGY, THE RARITY OF A BIOLOGICAL STATE, OR BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED. WHILE ONE TECHNOLOGY MAY HAVE HIGH SPARSITY IN BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS, THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE EXISTING, COMPLEMENTARY DATA FROM AN ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY TO IMPUTE THE MISSING BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. WE ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY UTILIZING NEW METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN MACHINE LEARNING, PRIMARILY FOCUSING ON DOMAIN ADAPTATION TECHNIQUES. THESE TECHNIQUES LEARN PATTERNS IN ONE DATASET THAT CAN BE ADAPTED TO ANOTHER DATASET, ENABLING CROSS-TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SHARING. OUR PROPOSAL INTRODUCES A GENERAL FRAMEWORK IN WHICH DOMAIN ADAPTATION TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO UNITE AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY WITH A DIFFERENT, BUT TECHNOLOGY. TO HIGHLIGHT THE BROAD UTILITY OF THIS APPROACH, WE APPLY THIS MODEL TO THREE BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS: 1) PREDICT CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC PERTURBATION RESPONSE IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS; 2) PREDICT TISSUE-OF-ORIGIN FROM CELL-FREE DNA (CFDNA); 3) PREDICT PROGENITOR-SPECIFIC GENE SIGNATURES FROM CELL-FREE DNA IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML).

FURTHER, THE CANDIDATE WILL UTILIZE WORLD-CLASS RESOURCES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE STANFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, OFFICE OF POSTDOCTORAL AFFAIRS, AND NHGRI-FUNDED CENTERS AT STANFORD TO ACQUIRE CAREER DEVELOPMENT SKILLS WHILE INTERFACING WITH LEADERS IN GENOMICS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN HIS MENTORS\u2019 LABS WILL ENABLE HIM TO EFFICIENTLY PERFORM THE SCIENTIFIC AIMS, RECEIVE TRAINING IN AREAS ENCOMPASSED BY THIS PROPOSAL, AND TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE.  THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP SINGLE-CELL GENOMICS METHODS TO CHART SOMATIC EVOLUTION THROUGHOUT THE HUMAN BODY. EVIDENCE FROM RECENT BULK SEQUENCING STUDIES HAS INDICATED THAT SOMATIC EVOLUTION OCCURS IN ALMOST ALL TISSUES, BUT CURRENT APPROACHES LACK SENSITIVITY TO RESOLVE CLONAL EXPANSIONS, ASSOCIATED CELL STATES, OR THEIR PREVALENCE THROUGHOUT THE BODY. A KEY BOTTLENECK IN STUDYING SOMATIC EVOLUTION HAS BEEN LIMITATIONS OF GENOMICS TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH IF ADDRESSED, MAY LEAD TO INSIGHTS INTO THE PATHOGENESIS OF DISEASES LIKE CANCER.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE MAJORITY (>90%) OF DISEASE RELATED GENOME WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWAS) FOUND ASSOCIATIONS WITH VARIANTS IN NON- CODING AND LIKELY REGULATORY REGIONS IN THE GENOME. DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANCE, THE CODE AND GRAMMAR OF THESE REGULATORY ELEMENTS REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN MAKING THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUTATIONS IN THESE SEQUENCES CAN LEAD TO DISEASE EVEN MORE COMPLEX. REGULATORY ELEMENTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN A GENOME-WIDE MANNER USING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS CHIP-SEQ OR ATAC-SEQ. HOWEVER, THESE METHODS ARE DESCRIPTIVE AND DO NOT PROVIDE A FUNCTIONAL READOUT THAT TESTS WHETHER THESE ELEMENTS ARE INDEED FUNCTIONAL. MASSIVELY PARALLEL REPORTER ASSAYS (MPRAS) AND CRISPR-BASED SCREENS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DEVELOPED TO FUNCTIONALLY CHARACTERIZED THESE ELEMENTS IN A HIGH-THROUGHPUT MANNER. HOWEVER, MOST OF THESE TECHNIQUES USE CULTURED CELLS TO MEASURE ACTIVITY. AS SUCH, THE ACTIVITY AND FUNCTION OF THESE ELEMENTS AND THEIR VARIANTS IN AN ORGANISM HAS NOT BEEN TESTED. DUE TO THIS, COMPLEX PHENOTYPES, SUCH AS SPATIAL-TEMPORAL, AND TISSUE/CELL TYPE SPECIFICITY AND INTERACTIONS CANNOT BE ASSESSED FOR THESE ELEMENTS. IN THIS K99/R00 APPLICATION, I WILL DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ALLOW TO FUNCTIONALLY CHARACTERIZE REGULATORY ELEMENTS AND VARIANTS IN A HIGH THROUGHPUT MANNER IN MICE. ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS THAT PREVENT HIGH-THROUGHPUT ASSAYS IN MICE IS THE ZONA PELLUCIDA THAT SURROUNDS ONE-CELL STAGE EMBRYOS AND PREVENTS DOUBLE-STRANDED DNA TO BE INSERTED. RECENT REPORTS AND MY OWN PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT BY UTILIZING ADENO ASSOCIATED VIRUS SEROTYPE 6 (AAV6) AS A DELIVERY TOOL, DNA CAN INTEGRATE INTO ONE-CELL STAGE EMBRYOS. I PLAN TO USE AAV6 ALONG WITH THE PIGGYBAC TRANSPOSASE SYSTEM, THAT ALLOWS FOR GENOMIC INTEGRATION IN ALL THREE-GERM LAYERS, TO DEVELOP MPRA IN MICE (AIM K1). TO VALIDATE THE EFFECT OF SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE VARIANTS, I WILL DEVELOP LARGE-SCALE CRISPR SATURATION MUTAGENESIS ASSAYS IN MICE. THIS WILL BE DONE BY UTILIZING IN VITRO ELECTROPORATION INTO EMBRYOS AND BASE-EDITOR OR PRIME-EDITOR TRANSGENIC MICE (AIM K2). FINALLY, I WILL APPLY THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO GENERATE A CATALOG OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATORY ELEMENTS, INCLUDING TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS, INVOLVED IN DIFFERENTIATION OF THE THREE PRIMARY GERM LAYERS (AIM R1).

RECENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS IN SINGLE-CELL GENOMICS PROVIDED EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDY THE MOLECULAR PROFILES DURING DEVELOPMENT AND IN DISEASE AT UNPRECEDENTED RESOLUTION. HOWEVER, MONITORING INDIVIDUAL MODALITIES FROM SINGLE CELLS AT A TIME RUNS THE RISK OF OBTAINING ONLY PARTIAL PICTURES FROM THE COMPLEX REGULATORY NETWORK. MULTI-MODAL SINGLE-CELL GENOMICS TOOLS WOULD BE DESIRED TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION. I RECENTLY INVENTED A METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH-THROUGHPUT JOINT ANALYSIS OF OPEN CHROMATIN AND TRANSCRIPTOME FROM THE SAME SINGLE CELLS (PAIRED-SEQ) AND DEMONSTRATED ITS POTENTIAL FOR COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CELL- TYPE-SPECIFIC REGULATORY PROGRAMS FROM HETEROGENOUS BRAIN TISSUES. IN THIS K99/R00 APPLICATION, I PROPOSE TO FURTHER DEVELOP A SET OF NEW SINGLE-CELL MULTI-OMICS TOOLS TO STUDY THE DYNAMIC AND CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC REGULATORY CIRCUITS DURING MAMMALIAN DEVELOPMENT. I WILL IMPROVE THE SENSITIVITIES AND COVERAGES OF PAIRED-SEQ AND DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL METHOD FOR SINGLE-CELL MULTI-OMICS ANALYSIS FROM THE PHENOTYPIC LEVEL (AIM1).

INTERFERENCE WITH CIRCRNA TRANSLATION CAN LEAD TO TUMORIGENESIS AND METASTASIS OF CANCERS. IT IS UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, HOW DISRUPTING CIRCRNA TRANSLATION CAN CAUSE THE DISEASES. IDENTIFYING THE REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF CIRCRNA TRANSLATION CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE CLINICAL INSIGHTS. HOWEVER, CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES CANNOT DISTINGUISH CIRCRNAS FROM LINEAR RNAS EFFICIENTLY, SUCH THAT THE MECHANISM AND MOLECULAR COMPONENTS REGULATING CIRCRNA TRANSLATION REMAIN UNCLEAR. THUS, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO DEVELOP A TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN IDENTIFY THE COMPONENTS REGULATING CIRCRNA TRANSLATION WITH HIGHER SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY.  I HAVE DEVELOPED A HIGH-THROUGHPUT REPORTER SCREENING ASSAY THAT CAN SYSTEMATICALLY SCREEN AND IDENTIFY THE RNA SEQUENCES THAT INITIATE CIRCRNA TRANSLATION SPECIFICALLY. UTILIZING THE TECHNOLOGY, I DISCOVERED TWO GROUPS OF THE RNA SEQUENCES THAT SPECIFICALLY DRIVE TRANSLATION ON EITHER CIRCRNA OR LINEAR RNA, RESPECTIVELY, INDICATING THAT THE REGULATORY COMPONENTS BETWEEN LINEAR RNA AND CIRCRNA TRANSLATION ARE DIFFERENT (CHEN ET AL., RESUBMITTED TO SCIENCE). IN THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH, I WILL FURTHER ADAPT AND APPLY THIS NOVEL TECHNOLOGY TO (I) IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE THE SEQUENCE AND PROTEIN COMPONENTS THAT REGULATE CIRCRNA TRANSLATION SPECIFICALLY, (II) IDENTIFY THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GENETIC VARIATION, CIRCRNA TRANSLATION, AND DISEASE, (III) CHARACTERIZE CIRCRNA TRANSLATION IN A TISSUE-DEPENDENT MANNER SYSTEMATICALLY, AND (IV) BUILD A NON-INTEGRATIVE AND STABLE GENE EXPRESSION PLATFORM WITH TUNABLE EXPRESSION LEVEL AND TISSUE SPECIFICITY.

THE VAST GENETIC DIVERSITY IN THE REGION IS IRREFUTABLE.

THESE POPULATIONS, THE KHOESAN, RESIDE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PARTS OF SOUTH AFRICA AND THROUGHOUT NAMIBIA AND BOTSWANA. IN PREVIOUS WORK (PMID 27474727), I AND TWO OF MY MENTORS SHOWED THAT FINE-SCALE GENETIC POPULATION STRUCTURE BETWEEN THESE KHOESAN POPULATIONS REFLECTS ECOGEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES. IN ADDITION TO THIS UNIQUE KHOESAN ANCESTRY, POPULATIONS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA HAVE BEEN SHAPED BY NUMEROUS MIGRATIONS FROM WITHIN AFRICA (E.G. BANTU-SPEAKING PEOPLES) AND OUTSIDE AFRICA (NOTABLY EUROPEAN AND ASIAN POPULATIONS). THUS, THE PATTERNS OF DIVERSITY OBSERVED IN THIS AREA IS UNIQUE WITH NO COMPARABLE REGIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD. THESE SOUTHERN AFRICAN POPULATIONS WENT ON TO FURTHER ADAPT TO THEIR NEW ENVIRONMENT WHICH WAS PLAGUED BY DISEASE, RESOURCE LIMITATIONS AND HARSH CLIMATES. THE ROLE OF POSITIVE SELECTION IN THIS ADAPTION, REMAINS UNKNOWN.  USING ONE OF THE LARGEST WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING DATASET COLLECTIONS ENCOMPASSING NUMEROUS SOUTHERN AFRICAN POPULATIONS, WE AIM TO: 1) SCAN THESE DATASETS FOR SIGNALS OF POSITIVE SELECTION AND 2) EVALUATE THE FUNCTIONAL, BIOLOGICAL AND POTENTIALLY TRANSLATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE SIGNALS. THIS PROJECT WILL BE THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPREHENSIVE SINGLE STUDY OF NATURAL SELECTION ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. THE METHODS DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY WILL INFORM FUTURE SCANS FOR NATURAL SELECTION IN HETEROGENOUS, ADMIXED AFRICAN POPULATIONS.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, WHICH BUILDS UPON MY PRIOR RESEARCH AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE, REQUIRES MASTERY OF NEW SKILLS RELATED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR MONOGENIC DISORDERS IN UNSELECTED POPULATIONS. I HAVE ASSEMBLED AN INTERNATIONALLY-RENOWNED TEAM OF MENTORS, WHOSE AREAS OF EXPERTISE SPAN SEVERAL DOMAINS OF GENOMICS RESEARCH AND MEDICINE. MY MENTORS INCLUDE DR. ROBERT GREEN, AN EXPERT IN THE MEDICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GENOMIC MEDICINE; DR. HEIDI REHM, AN EXPERT IN VARIANT CURATION AND GENE-DISEASE RELATIONSHIPS; AND DR. PRADEEP NATARAJAN, AN EXPERT IN COMPUTATIONAL AND INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS. THROUGH THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND TRAINING, I WILL DEVELOP INTERDISCIPLINARY SKILLS THAT WILL ENABLE ME TO TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE AS A PHYSICIAN-SCIENTIST. ALTHOUGH MONOGENIC GENETIC DISORDERS ARE INDIVIDUALLY RARE, THEY ARE ESTIMATED TO COLLECTIVELY AFFECT 1.5\u20136.2% OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION. MOST INDIVIDUALS WITH GENETIC CONDITIONS PRESENT TO MEDICAL CARE AFTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SYMPTOMS AND RECEIVE DIAGNOSES FOLLOWING LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC ODYSSEYS. AS THE NUMBER OF TREATABLE GENETIC CONDITIONS GROWS, THE NEED TO IDENTIFY AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS EARLY HAS BECOME MORE URGENT. POPULATION-BASED GENOMIC SEQUENCING, ALSO KNOWN AS A \u201cGENOME-FIRST APPROACH,\u201d PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES BY SCREENING INDIVIDUALS FOR GENETIC DISORDERS PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS. AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PENETRANCE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH GENETIC RISK VARIANTS FROM UNSELECTED POPULATIONS. IN THIS PROJECT, I PROPOSE TO: 1) IDENTIFY THE PREVALENCE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH RISK VARIANTS FOR A RANGE OF TREATABLE MONOGENIC CONDITIONS IN BOTH THE HOSPITAL-BASED MASS GENERAL BRIGHAM BIOBANK (MGBB) AND U.K. BIOBANK (UKB), 2) RECONTACT INDIVIDUALS IN THE MGBB WHO HAVE GENOTYPES ASSOCIATED WITH TREATABLE INHERITED METABOLIC DISORDERS (IMDS) TO IDENTIFY VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE EXPRESSION, AND 3) DETERMINE IF METABOLIC PROFILING IN THE UKB CAN BE USED TO PREDICT OUTCOMES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH RISK VARIANTS FOR A SUBSET OF IMDS.

ALTHOUGH PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES SUCH AS THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS AND THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL GENETICS ADVOCATE FOR GENETIC CARRIER SCREENING TO BE DONE PRIOR TO PREGNANCY (PRECONCEPTION), ACCESS TO PRECONCEPTION GENETIC CARRIER SCREENING REMAINS LOW AND INEQUITABLE. THIS IS BECAUSE IMPLEMENTATION OF CARRIER SCREENING IN A DIVERSE NATIONAL POPULATION IS COMPLICATED AND REQUIRES 1) UNDERSTANDING THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF SCREENING AT ALL LEVELS OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY, 2) RECOGNIZING PATIENT PREFERENCES FOR TEST DELIVERY, AND 3) CLARIFYING POTENTIAL PERSONAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF CARRIER SCREENING. THIS AWARD WILL BE USED TO ADDRESS THESE THREE GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PRECONCEPTION GENETIC CARRIER SCREENING. FIRST, I WILL INTERVIEW KEY INFORMANTS WITH EXPERIENCE AT ALL LEVELS OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ABOUT THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO IMPLEMENTING PRECONCEPTION CARRIER SCREENING PROGRAMS. SECOND, I WILL SYSTEMATICALLY ELICIT PATIENT PREFERENCES ABOUT HOW GENETIC CARRIER SCREENING SHOULD BE DELIVERED USING A DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENT. THE DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENT WILL CONSIST OF A WEB-BASED SURVEY IN WHICH DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES OF HOW PRECONCEPTION CARRIER SCREENING IS OFFERED ARE VARIED AND PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS MUST CHOOSE THEIR PREFERRED SCREENING METHOD.

CALLAHAN AND HER MENTORSHIP TEAM HAVE DEVISED A CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT INTEGRATES: (1) INTENSIVE MENTORSHIP FROM A TEAM OF MENTORS AND ADVISORS WITH WHOM DR. CALLAHAN HAS A TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATION, (2) ADVANCED TRAINING IN GENETIC SCIENCE AND TESTING, QUALITATIVE METHODS, AND MEDICAL SIMULATION, AND (3) AN INNOVATIVE RESEARCH PLAN DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE HOW NEONATOLOGISTS AND PARENTS OF NEONATES MANAGE THE UNCERTAINTY OF GENETIC INFORMATION. RESEARCH: GENETIC TESTING IS INCREASINGLY USED IN ILL NEONATES AND HOLDS PROMISE TO IMPROVE CARE. HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE, MANY GENETIC RESULTS CONTAIN SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY, WHICH CAN LEAD BOTH CLINICIANS AND PARENTS TO MISUNDERSTAND OR MISAPPLY RESULTS, RESULTING IN BIASED TREATMENT PLANS. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW UNCERTAINTY AFFECTS NEONATOLOGISTS\u2019 USE AND COMMUNICATION OF GENETIC INFORMATION OR PARENTS\u2019 UNDERSTANDING OF THIS INFORMATION IN PRACTICE. DR. CALLAHAN\u2019S MENTORED, MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH WILL FILL THE CRITICAL NEED TO IDENTIFY AND MEDIATE POTENTIAL RISKS THAT EMERGE AS NEONATOLOGISTS AND PARENTS INCREASINGLY USE UNCERTAIN GENETIC RESULTS IN PRACTICE. AIM 1 WILL IDENTIFY THE TYPES OF UNCERTAINTY THAT NEONATOLOGISTS AND PARENTS PERCEIVE WHEN THEY RECEIVE GENETIC RESULTS AND EXAMINE HOW THIS UNCERTAINTY AFFECTS UNDERSTANDING AND USE OF RESULTS. AIM 2 WILL ASSESS THE EFFECT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT PROGNOSIS ON NEONATOLOGISTS\u2019 COUNSELING ABOUT GENETIC INFORMATION AND POTENTIAL DISABILITY. AIM 3 WILL DEVELOP AND PRELIMINARY TEST AN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT AIMS TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING AND STANDARDIZE COMMUNICATION OF GENETIC INFORMATION AND ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTY BETWEEN GENETICISTS, NEONATOLOGISTS, AND PARENTS. SIGNIFICANCE: COMPLETING THESE AIMS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A STRUCTURED CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN WILL PREPARE DR. CALLAHAN TO BE AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR POISED TO EXECUTE THE NHGRI VISION OF INTEGRATING COMPLEX GENETIC INFORMATION INTO THE CLINICAL WORKFLOW IN NEWBORN MEDICINE.

GENOMIC SEQUENCE EDITING BY CRISPR/CAS HAS GARNERED HEIGHTENED INTEREST AS POTENTIAL THERAPEUTICS, BUT STILL CARRIES RISKS OF OFF-TARGET MUTAGENICITY, AND IS LESS EFFECTIVE AT TARGETING CIS-REGULATORY ELEMENTS, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF DISEASE-ASSOCIATED VARIANTS RESIDE. A CONCEPTUAL ALTERNATIVE TO DNA SEQUENCE EDITING IS TO DELIVER A BRIEF PULSE OF A SYNTHETIC THERAPEUTIC THAT CAN TRIGGER MEMORIZED SILENCING OF TARGET PROMOTERS AND ENHANCERS IN A \"HIT-AND-RUN\" STRATEGY, BYPASSING CONCERNS OF MUTAGENICITY ASSOCIATED WITH DNA SEQUENCE EDITING, AND IMMUNOGENICITY ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSION OF CRISPR/CAS COMPONENTS. IN PRACTICE, ENGINEERING SUSTAINED EPIGENETIC TRANSCRIPTIONAL SILENCING HAS HAD MIXED SUCCESS, BUT RECENT EFFORTS DEMONSTRATE THAT CONSTRUCTING SPECIFIC COMBINATIONS OF CHROMATIN SIGNALS -- BROADLY ENCOMPASSING CIS- REGULATORY ELEMENTS, REGULATORY PROTEIN COMPLEXES, AND COVALENT CHROMATIN MODIFICATIONS -- CAN BE CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS. HOWEVER, EXISTING TOOLS FOR MANIPULATING CHROMATIN SIGNALS AT HIGH THROUGHPUT ARE LIMITED IN COMBINATORIAL CAPACITY. THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS THE KNOWLEDGE BASE AND GENERALIZABLE CRISPR/CAS TOOLS TO OVERCOME SUCH LIMITATIONS TO ENABLE SYSTEMATIC ENGINEERING OF EPIGENETIC SILENCING MEMORY ACROSS GENOMIC LOCI IN HUMAN CELLS.

ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT, THOUGH, HAVE BEEN CRUCIALLY IMPAIRED BY PATIENTS FEELING OF A LACK OF CLINICAL OR SOCIAL VALIDATION, LEAVING THEM FEELING DISBELIEVED. THESE FEELINGS OF INVALIDATION DELAY DIAGNOSIS, CAUSING AN EXTENDED \u201cDIAGNOSTIC ODYSSEY,\u201d BY DRIVING PATIENTS TO AVOID HEALTHCARE AND LEADING TO ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME (EDS), ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT RARE GENETIC DISEASES, IS A PRIME SITE OF SUCH FAILURE. CLINICIANS MAY DOWNPLAY OR EVEN DISMISS PATIENTS OFTEN-DISABLING MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, LEADING PATIENTS TO REPORT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES AND DISTRUST IN CLINICAL ENCOUNTERS. LITTLE WORK HAS FOCUSED ON THE EXPERIENCES AND VIEWS OF SUCH PATIENTS OR THEIR CLINICIANS, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND ADDRESS FEELINGS OF INVALIDATION THAT DRIVE THESE PROBLEMS. THEREFORE, RESEARCH IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE WAYS TO IMPROVE HOW PATIENTS WITH EDS \u2013 AS WELL AS OTHER, SIMILAR RARE DISEASES \u2013 COME TO FEEL VALIDATED AND INVALIDATED, AND HOW INVALIDATION CAN BE COUNTERED, TO SUPPLEMENT AND SUPPORT THE BREAKTHROUGHS IN GENETICS THAT ARE REVOLUTIONIZING CARE IN THESE AREAS. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED STUDY IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE VIEWS AND OPINIONS OF PATIENTS WITH EDS AND THEIR CLINICIANS REGARDING THE ROLE OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS IN VALIDATING THE EXPERIENCES OF PATIENTS WITH RARE DISEASES. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT FEELINGS OF INVALIDATION DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO AN INCREASINGLY TROUBLED PATIENT\u2013 PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT A MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS MAY ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE TROUBLES WHILE EXACERBATING OTHERS.

CONCRETE, TAILORED STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED TO ETHICALLY ENGAGE VARIOUS UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS TO PROMOTE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO GENOMIC DISCOVERY AND TRANSLATION. ONE REGION OF THE U.S. IN WHICH SUCH STRATEGIES ARE LIKELY TO BE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE RURAL SOUTH. U.S. RESIDENTS IN THE RURAL SOUTH EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT HEALTH DISPARITIES; HAVE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GENETICS AND GENOMIC SCIENCE; ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN GENOMICS RESEARCH; AND WOULD LIKELY BENEFIT SUBSTANTIALLY FROM SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN GENOMICS. IMPORTANTLY, THE STRUCTURALLY EMBEDDED FACTORS THAT HINDER MEMBERS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES FROM ACCESSING ADVANCES IN HEALTH CARE\u2014AND ULTIMATELY PERPETUATE HEALTH INEQUITIES\u2014MIGHT SIMILARLY IMPAIR WIDESPREAD, INFORMED, PARTICIPATION IN GENOMICS.

STUDIES SUGGEST THAT GS (INCLUDING EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING) MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A DIAGNOSIS TO UP TO 50 PERCENT OF PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY UNDIAGNOSED AFTER EXTENSIVE CLINICAL AND GENETIC TESTING. HOWEVER, THE DOWNSTREAM BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THESE TESTS FOR PATIENTS, FAMILIES, AND THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM REMAIN POORLY DEFINED AND METHODOLOGICALLY CHALLENGING TO ASSESS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE CHALLENGES, LEADERS IN HEALTH ECONOMICS AND POLICY HAVE CALLED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, INTERDISCIPLINARY METHODS FOR DEFINING AND MEASURING THE VALUE OF GS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THESE METHODS ARE NOT ONLY ACCURATE, BUT ALSO ETHICAL, IT IS CRITICAL TO BRING TO THE SURFACE A CONSIDERATION OF THE VALUES AND PREFERENCES OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS (I.E., PATIENTS, FAMILIES, CLINICIANS, PAYERS) INVOLVED IN THE USE OF GS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF RARE DISEASES, AND WHOSE VALUES ARE SERVED BY DIFFERENT METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO DEFINING AND MEASURING THE VALUE OF GS.  THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO EXAMINE BOTH HOW WE CAN, AND HOW WE SHOULD, DEFINE AND MEASURE THE VALUE OF GS FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH RARE DISEASES.

AIM 1: TO IDENTIFY THE RANGE OF POTENTIAL DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS OF GS FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS UNDERGOING GS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF RARE DISEASES AND THEIR FAMILIES, USING IN-DEPTH ETHNOGRAPHIC METHODS TO CAPTURE PERSPECTIVES OF DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS. AIM TWO: TO BUILD ON AIM 1 TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK MAPPING THE RANGE OF COSTS AND BENEFITS OF GS AS THEY RELATE TO A) DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES ON THE VALUE OF GS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF RARE DISEASES; AND B) RELEVANT DOMAINS OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL) FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH RARE DISEASES. AIM THREE: TO BUILD ON AIM 2 TO DEVELOP A PREFERENCE-BASED MEASURE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF GS ON HRQL SPECIFICALLY FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH RARE GENETIC DISEASES FOR USE IN FUTURE ECONOMIC EVALUATIONS OF GS.

LARGE PUBLIC POPULATION CONSORTIA ARE NOW ACCUMULATING DATASETS OF SUFFICIENT SIZE TO DETECT REGIONS SUBJECT TO EVOLUTIONARY SELECTIVE PRESSURES AT AN INCREASINGLY GRANULAR LEVEL. HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS A SHORTAGE OF APPROPRIATE ANALYTICAL TOOLS THAT ARE BUILT TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS IMPORTANT ISSUES OF DISEASE HETEROGENEITY ACROSS DIVERSE POPULATIONS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT CLINICAL EXOME SEQUENCING IS INCREASINGLY USED FOR IMPROVED DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION, MANY GENETIC DISORDERS REMAIN UNCHARACTERIZED AND DIAGNOSIS RATES ARE STILL RELATIVELY LOW. IN AIM 1, I WILL DEVELOP METHODOLOGY THAT LOCALIZES REGIONS INTOLERANT TO VARIATION AND DIFFERENTIAL ISOFORM EXPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE. MANY GENES DISPLAY TISSUE DEPENDENT TRANSCRIPT ISOFORMS INDICATING POTENTIAL FUNCTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENT ISOFORMS. I WILL CHARACTERIZE SELECTIVE PRESSURE ACROSS ALL ISOFORMS USING BAYESIAN TECHNIQUES BY LOOKING AT PATTERNS OF GENETIC CONSTRAINT ACROSS LARGE STANDING POPULATIONS, PREDOMINANTLY LEVERAGING PUBLIC DATA SETS ON THE ORDER OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SAMPLES.

THEN BY ACCOUNTING FOR REGIONAL INTOLERANCE TO VARIATION, A JOINT TRANSCRIPTOMIC VARIATION\u2013INTOLERANCE APPROACH CAN BE EMPLOYED TO IMPROVE DISEASE ASSOCIATION TESTING. IN AIM 2, I WILL ANALYZE ANCESTRY AND CROSS SPECIES PATTERNS OF GENETIC INTOLERANCE TO VARIATION. THE MAJORITY OF GENETIC STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON EUROPEAN POPULATIONS, WHICH IGNORES GENETIC AND PHENOTYPIC DIVERSITY THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO IMPROVE BOTH TARGETED AND OVERALL DIAGNOSTIC AND CLINICAL CAPABILITIES. I WILL TEST FOR ANCESTRY AND CROSS SPECIES PATTERNS OF GENETIC INTOLERANCE TO VARIATION AND ASSOCIATION WITH DISEASE. EXPANDING TO MORE POPULATIONS WILL SCALE UP THE ALREADY LARGE SET OF PARAMETERS BEING ESTIMATED; SO, I WILL DEVELOP NEW STATISTICAL METHODS AND SOFTWARE TO IMPROVE OPTIMIZATION OF PARAMETER ESTIMATION FOR THE BAYESIAN HIERARCHICAL MODELS. I WILL ISOLATE KEY ANCESTRAL POPULATIONS WITH KNOWN DIFFERENCES IN SELECTIVE PRESSURE TO VALIDATE FINDINGS WHILE THEN LEVERAGING THESE NEW METHODS AND POPULATION DISEASE PATTERNS FURTHER TO ISOLATE NOVEL SIGNALS OF ANCESTRY-SPECIFIC SELECTIVE PRESSURES.

MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TRAINED ON LARGE SEQUENCE DATABASES HAVE CLAIMED TO PREDICT DELETERIOUS EFFECTS FROM CODING VARIANTS IN SEVERAL MODEL PROTEINS, BUT TO DATE THEIR PRACTICAL USAGE HAS BEEN LIMITED BECAUSE OF TWO MAJOR CHALLENGES. THE FIRST IS THE LACK OF DESCRIPTIVE, \u201cGROUND TRUTH\u201d BIOPHYSICAL DATASETS RELATING SEQUENCE VARIATION TO NATIVE PROTEIN PROPERTIES, DUE TO THE LOW THROUGHPUT OF TRADITIONAL BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS. THE SECOND IS THAT THERE IS NOT A WELL- ESTABLISHED METHOD FOR INTEGRATING THESE DATA IN STATE-OF-THE-ART PREDICTIVE MODELS.

MOST DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION METHODS SEEK TO IDENTIFY A SMALL NUMBER OF GENES AND GENE-SETS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY A GENETIC PERTURBATION. HOWEVER, SOME GENES, SUCH AS CHROMATIN REGULATORS, MAY IMPACT THOUSANDS OF GENES ACROSS THE TRANSCRIPTOME. THESE DISPERSED EFFECTS ARE NOT CAPTURED BY EXISTING METHODS. WE WILL ADDRESS THIS METHODOLOGICAL GAP IN THE DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION FIELD BY DEVELOPING A NOVEL STATISTICAL TOOL, AND WILL APPLY THIS TOOL TO BOTH NORMATIVE AND DISEASE CONTEXTS. IN AIM 1, WE PROPOSE THE TRANSCRIPTOME-WIDE IMPACT MODEL (TIM), A PARAMETRIC LIKELIHOOD-BASED ESTIMATOR OF THE OVERALL EFFECT THAT A PERTURBATION HAS ON THE TRANSCRIPTOME. TIM BUILDS ON EXISTING DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION METHODS, BUT ESTIMATES PARAMETERS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION EFFECTS, RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL PER-GENE EFFECT SIZES. THIS MODEL IS ALSO EXTENDED TO ESTIMATE GENE-SET ENRICHMENTS AND CORRELATION BETWEEN DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION SIGNATURES.

I PROPOSE TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING AIMS: (1) TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE FROM EXISTING PUBLIC SINGLE- CELL DATA TO NEW EXPERIMENTAL DATA USING A DEEP NEURAL-ATTENTION NETWORK, AND (2) DEVELOP THE FIRST SPATIALLY- INFORMED MODEL FOR GENERATING REALISTIC SCRNASEQ DATA. IN AIM 1, I WILL USE THE \"ATTENTION\" MECHANISMS (WHICH HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED MANY FIELDS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE) TO LEARN COMPLEX GENE DEPENDENCIES INTELLIGENTLY AND LEARN IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL FEATURES (E.G., MARKER GENES) IN A FULLY SELF-SUPERVISED MANNER, PROVIDING BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETABILITY THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. SUCH A MODEL CAN BE USED IN MANY TASKS AND FOR DATASETS WITH RELATIVELY FEW SAMPLES. THE LEARNED KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED FROM AIM 1 WILL BE USED DIRECTLY IN AIM 2. IN AIM 2, I WILL BUILD UPON OUR STATE-OF-THE-ART GENERATIVE MODEL TO GENERATE SYNTHETIC DATA THAT CONTAINS SPATIAL INFORMATION (COORDINATES) OF SEQUENCED CELLS, EVEN WHEN NO ATLAS IS AVAILABLE. THIS MODEL WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO PRODUCE SYNTHETIC DATA WITH SPATIAL INFORMATION AND AUGMENT SPARSE AND NOISY DATASETS FOR MORE ROBUST AND ACCURATE ANALYSES, ALL POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL COSTLY EXPERIMENTS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL SUPPORT MY DISSERTATION RESEARCH, WHICH WILL BE THE FOUNDATIONAL BODY OF WORK FOR MY CAREER AS A RESEARCHER IN COMPUTATIONAL GENOMICS. DURING THE TENURE OF THIS AWARD, I WILL RECEIVE SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN THE UNDERLYING MATHEMATICS AND BIOLOGY NEEDED FOR DEVELOPING FRAMEWORKS FOR SCRNASEQ ANALYSIS. I WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE BY DEVELOPING NOVEL METHODOLOGY AND CREATING OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE, MAKING OUR TOOLS AND MODELS EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE BROADER SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. ACHIEVING THE PROPOSED AIMS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE SCRNASEQ PIPELINES AND ANALYSIS, MAKING THEM MORE ROBUST AND ACCURATE.

THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-READ SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES HAS BEGUN TO REVEAL THE PREVALENCE AND PHENOTYPIC IMPACTS OF LARGER INSERTIONS, DELETIONS, AND REARRANGEMENTS, COLLECTIVELY TERMED STRUCTURAL VARIANTS (SVS). HOWEVER, LONG-READ SEQUENCING METHODS REMAIN IMPRACTICAL FOR LARGE-SCALE APPLICATION DUE TO THEIR HIGH COST AND LOW THROUGHPUT. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ROLE OF SVS IN HUMAN EVOLUTION IS STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD.  THESE CHALLENGES MOTIVATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES THAT COMBINE THE ACCURACY OF SV DISCOVERY USING LONG READS WITH THE SCALE AND GLOBAL DIVERSITY OF SHORT-READ SEQUENCING DATASETS. TO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW SVS IMPACT FITNESS AND GENOME FUNCTION IN HUMANS, THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT WILL:  1. IDENTIFY LOCALLY ADAPTIVE SVS BY LEVERAGING GRAPH-BASED METHODS FOR SV GENOTYPING. THIS APPROACH  ENABLES ACCURATE GENOTYPING OF SVS DISCOVERED WITH LONG READS IN SHORT-READ DATASETS FROM DIVERSE  HUMAN POPULATIONS.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR LINEAGE TRACING CAN TRACK THE PROGENY OF SINGLE CELLS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR INITIAL GENE EXPRESSION. THE MORRIS LAB HAS DEVELOPED A SINGLE-CELL LINEAGE TRACING (SCLT) METHOD, CALLED CELLTAGGING. CELLTAGGING DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY OF SCLT APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY SIMILARITIES IN CELLS BASED ON LINEAGE AND OFFER MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS TO CELL REPROGRAMMING. CELLTAGGING AND OTHER VIRUS-BASED SCLT TECHNOLOGIES STILL PRESENT LIMITATIONS, THOUGH, IN THAT THEY REQUIRE MULTIPLE TRANSDUCTIONS TO INCREASE LINEAGE RESOLUTION, AND MAY FAIL TO CAPTURE BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT BIFURCATION EVENTS DUE TO CELL LABELING AT DISCRETE TIME POINTS. THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO TRANSGENE SILENCING IN CERTAIN CELL MODELS, SUCH AS IPSC-DERIVED ORGANOIDS, RENDERING THEM INEFFECTIVE FOR USE IN MANY MODELS OF DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASE.

IN AIM 3, I WILL ESTIMATE THE GENOME-WIDE IMPACT OF ADDITIVE COMBINATIONS OF REGULATORY VARIANTS \u2014 COMMONLY OBSERVED IN REGIONS OF GENETIC ASSOCIATION \u2014 ON THE EXPRESSION OF A GENE; AND TEST WHETHER THOSE EFFECTS CAN EXPLAIN DOWNSTREAM PHENOTYPES. TO DO SO, I WILL USE THE EMPIRICALLY MEASURED EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL REGULATORY VARIANTS TO ESTIMATE THEIR COMBINED EFFECT IN HAPLOTYPES WITH MULTIPLE VARIANTS AND THEN VALIDATE THEIR FUNCTIONAL IMPACT ON GENE EXPRESSION IN VITRO USING CRISPR GENOME EDITING. THE EXPECTED OUTCOME WILL BE THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE DATASET DETAILING THE LOCATION AND FUNCTIONAL EFFECTS OF REGULATORY VARIANTS FROM DIVERSE HUMAN POPULATIONS. BY DISTRIBUTING THOSE DATA VIA AN ONLINE PUBLIC DATABASE, RESEARCHERS WILL BE ABLE TO QUERY WHICH REGULATORY VARIANTS MAY EXPLAIN RESULTS FROM THEIR OWN ASSOCIATION STUDIES. THUS, THESE RESULTS WILL ENABLE EASIER IDENTIFICATION OF CAUSAL GENETIC VARIANTS AND ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO SHIFT THEIR FOCUS TOWARD DEVELOPING PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS.
