IMPLEMENTATION GRANT OF $400,000 TO RE-ENVISION A 30-YEAR-OLD EXHIBITION, THE ?IMAGINATION GALLERY,? AS \"IMAGINED WESTS.\" OUR GOALS ARE TO EXPLAIN THE HISTORICAL AND CURRENT SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ?IMAGINED WEST,? AND STIMULATE CRITICAL REFLECTION AND PARTICIPATION IN RESHAPING CULTURAL NARRATIVES. THE EXHIBITION SEEKS TO WIDEN ITS VIEW FROM A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE WESTERN GENRE TO REFLECT NEW UNDERSTANDINGS OF POPULAR CULTURE, GENRE ART, GENDER AND ETHNICITY. THE NEW, PERMANENT EXHIBITION WILL EXPLORE MANY MYTHS OF THE WEST. THE PRIMARY LEARNING OBJECTIVE WILL EXPLORE THE POWER OF THESE MYTHS, BUT ALSO THEIR MALLEABILITY. THERE WILL BE FOUR THEMES: OVERLAPPING IMAGINED GEOGRAPHIES OF THE IMAGINED WEST; THE POWER OF MYTHS TO SHAPE THE WEST AND THE WORLD; THE POWER OF CREATIVE ACTORS TO CHANGE PERCEPTIONS; AND THE CROSS-CULTURAL HYBRIDITY OF POPULAR CULTURE IN THE WEST.
