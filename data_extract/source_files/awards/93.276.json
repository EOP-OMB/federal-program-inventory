WITH OVER 2.6 MILLION RESIDENTS, IT IS A PART OF THE DALLAS/FORT WORTH METROPLEX, MADE UP OF SOME OF THE FASTEST-GROWING CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF TEXAS WITH A COMBINED POPULATION OF ALMOST 7 MILLION PEOPLE. DALLAS COUNTY IS HOME TO OVER 20 FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES WITH MANY MORE NOTABLE COMPANIES EITHER HOME-BASED OR WITH A REGIONAL PRESENCE. MOST DAYS, THERE IS NEWS OF ANOTHER LARGE CORPORATION MOVING INTO THE AREA \u2013 ATTRACTED TO THE STRONG EMPLOYMENT BASE, GROWING SUBURBS WITH GOOD HOUSING AND TOP-RATED SCHOOLS, TAX INCENTIVES, PROXIMITY TO AN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, AND OF COURSE, A VIBRANT ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS, AND SOCIAL SCENE.  DESPITE THIS VIGOROUS AND SPIRITED ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS NEIGHBORHOODS OF GREAT WEALTH, THERE ARE AREAS IN DALLAS COUNTY WHERE INCOME DISPARITIES, HEALTH INEQUITIES, AND CRIME ARE THE NORM RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION. MANY HAVE HIGHER INCARCERATION RATES, LOWER AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME, AND HIGHER NUMBER OF DRUG-RELATED OFFENSES COMPARED TO MORE AFFLUENT AREAS. CURRENTLY, DATA ON YOUTH DRUG USE HAS ONLY BEEN AVAILABLE ON A COUNTY-WIDE/REGIONAL BASIS BUT WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS IN THESE \u201cCOMMUNITIES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY\u201d.  ACCORDINGLY, DATA COLLECTION AND SUBSEQUENT PREVENTION STRATEGIES REQUIRE A UNIQUE AND INNOVATIVE APPROACH, CUSTOMIZED TO THE SPECIFIC TRENDS IN THAT AREA. WE, AS A COMMUNITY, CANNOT CONTINUE TO SHOWCASE ALL THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF DALLAS, WHILE DISMISSING THE WEAKNESSES THAT EXIST IN SOME PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY \u2013 WEAKNESSES THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE LIVES OF ITS CITIZENS. WE BELIEVE IT IS ABOUT RESPECTING AND WANTING THE BEST FOR THOSE THAT LIVE AND WORK IN THESE MARGINALIZED AREAS.  OUR COALITION, DALLAS AREA DRUG PREVENTION PARTNERSHIP-SOUTH (DADPP-SOUTH) HAS IDENTIFIED SIX ZIP CODES IN DALLAS COUNTY EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST CHALLENGES OF THE AREA:  CRIME, DRUG USE, POVERTY, POOR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, LACK OF HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS, AGING SCHOOLS AND INFRASTRUCTURE.  EVEN SO, THIS COMMUNITY HAS MANY CITIZENS AND GROUPS THAT STRONGLY DESIRE A REVITALIZATION BUT KNOW IT WILL TAKE A COHESIVE AND UNIFIED EFFORT TO CREATE REAL CHANGE. DADPP-SOUTH HAS DEVELOPED CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY TO INCREASE COLLABORATION AND CREATE BEST-PRACTICE DRUG PREVENTION STRATEGIES. THE GOAL OF DADPP-SOUTH IS TO IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE-BASED ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES AIMED AT POPULATION-LEVEL CHANGE IN OUR TARGET ZIP CODES BY 1) LIMITING YOUTH ACCESS TO SUBSTANCES; 2) CHANGING THE CULTURE AND CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT SUBSTANCES; 3) SHIFTING THE CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE; AND 4) ADDRESSING ISSUES RELATED TO HEALTH DISPARITIES AND PROMOTING HEALTH EQUITY.  DRUG AND ALCOHOL MISUSE, AND THE PROBLEMS IT CREATES, WILL IMPEDE THE BEST EFFORTS OF ALMOST EVERY OTHER COMMUNITY INITIATIVE DUE TO ITS PERVASIVE NEGATIVE EFFECT, AND ACCORDINGLY, PREVENTION IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT. BY WORKING TOGETHER AS A COALITION, THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IS BASED ON THE SIMPLE PREMISE THAT LOCAL PEOPLE ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO SOLVE LOCAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THE PREVENTION OF PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY OCCUR. COALITIONS RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT WHAT THEY HELP CREATE, AND CHANGE IS MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR WHEN THE PROCESS ENGAGES MULTIPLE SECTORS OF A COMMUNITY IN A COOPERATIVE APPROACH. DADPP-SOUTH IS MADE UP OF CONCERNED CITIZENS REPRESENTING THE VARIOUS COMMUNITY SECTORS, EACH WITH THEIR OWN UNIQUE EXPERTISE, NETWORKS, INFLUENCE, AND PERSPECTIVE.

FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PROPOSAL, THE SCHCC WILL USE THE SOUTHWEST COUNCIL INC. AS A FISCAL AGENT.  SALEM COUNTY, NJ IS A SPARSELY POPULATED COUNTY ON THE BORDER WITH DELAWARE. THE COUNTY HAS RICH AGRICULTURAL ROOTS BUT IS ECONOMICALLY DEPRIVED WITH LIMITED POCKETS OF PROSPERITY.  THE 2020 CENSUS DOCUMENTED 64,837 PEOPLE LIVING IN SALEM\u2019S 15 MUNICIPALITIES AND SURROUNDING LAND. THIRTY PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS SPEND MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT.   TWENTY-THREE PERCENT OF SALEM COUNTY CHILDREN UNDER 18 LIVE BELOW POVERTY, COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF 12%. IT IS LESS ETHNICALLY DIVERSE THAN THE REST OF THE STATE WITH 72% OF RESIDENTS IDENTIFYING AS WHITE ALONE. AFRICAN AMERICANS MAKE UP 15% OF RESIDENTS AND 10% OF THE COUNTY POPULATION IS LATINO OF ANY RACE.  THE 2021 COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS PUT SALEM COUNTY AT 20 OUT OF 21 COUNTIES IN TERMS OF POOREST HEALTH OUTCOMES AND LOWER PRESENCE OF HEALTH FACTORS. THE PRIMARY DRUGS OF CONCERN ARE TOBACCO, ALCOHOL, AND MARIJUANA, FOLLOWED BY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. BASED ON THIS INITIAL ASSESSMENT THE PRIMARY ROOT CAUSES FOR YOUTH  SUBSTANCE USE IN SALEM COUNTY INCLUDE 1. INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, MARIJUANA AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 2. MINIMAL PERCEPTION OF HARM OF YOUTH TOBACCO AND MARIJUANA USE AMONG YOUTH AND ADULTS. 3.INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT SUPPORT YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING.  TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, THE SCHCC PLANS TO ENGAGE YOUTH AND ADULTS ACROSS THE COUNTY TO :  1. BUILD RESILIENCY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES, ESPECIALLY IN THE COMMUNITIES OF SALEM CITY AND PENNS GROVE/CARNEYS POINT BY ESTABLISHING SCHOOL RESILIENCY TEAMS PREPARED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH ACE DRIVEN ACADEMIC CHALLENGES.  THIS WILL BUILD PROTECTIVE FACTORS INCLUDING IMPROVED ACADEMIC ATTAINMENT/SUCCESS, INCREASED ATTACHMENT TO SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY AND INCREASED PRESENCE OF CARING AND SUPPORTIVE ADULTS. 2. CREATE A CULTURE OF CARE AND CONCERN ABOUT YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE THAT INCREASES THE PERCEIVED RISK OF HARM AND PARENT AND PEER DISAPPROVAL FOR MARIJUANA, TOBACCO, ALCOHOL AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE BY BUILDING AWARENESS OF HOW YOUTH USE THESE SUBSTANCES AMONG PARENTS, EDUCATORS AND PHYSICIANS AND BY CHANGING POLICY TO INCREASE CONSEQUENCE FOR ADULTS THAT PROVIDE ALCOHOL TO YOUTH AS WELL AS DISCOURAGING POLICY THAT INCREASES ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED MARIJUANA.  3. BUILD SKILLS TO PREPARE YOUTH TO ADVOCATE FOR PREVENTION POLICY AND TO FOSTER PREVENTION LEADERSHIP THROUGH ONGOING PREVENTION TRAINING AND YOUTH-LED PREVENTION ACTIVITIES.  4. LEVERAGE PARTNERSHIPS TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH INCLUDING POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING THAT WILL ENABLE YOUTH TO BETTER NEGOTIATE THE SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY CONTEXT THAT SURROUNDS THEM. ADDITIONALLY, SCHCC WILL PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS TO INCREASE PRESCRIPTION DRUG DISPOSAL OPTIONS IN SALEM COUNTY AND PROMOTE PARTNERS MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PREVENTION ACROSS THE COUNTY.  THE STRATEGIES OUTLINED ABOVE ALONG WITH OTHERS IDENTIFIED THROUGH ONGOING ASSESSMENT AND COURSE CORRECTION MEASURES WILL HELP SCHCC ACHIEVE THE CHANGES IN SCHOOLS AND BROADER COMMUNITIES THAT CAN SUSTAIN LONG TERM DECLINES IN YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE IN SALEM COUNTY.

THE COUNTY HAS TWO CITIES, HAZLEHURST (THE COUNTY SEAT) AND DENTON. A MAJOR PART OF ITS ECONOMIC BASE IS AGRICULTURE, ESPECIALLY TIMBER. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY BROUGHT THOUSANDS OF WORKERS TO THE AREA, AND MANY STAYED. JEFF DAVIS IS HOME TO 14,779 PEOPLE AND 5,689 HOUSEHOLDS. THE COUNTY\u2019S DEMOGRAPHICS ARE: 82% CAUCASIAN; 15% AFRICAN AMERICAN/BLACK; 1% ASIAN/PI; 2% MULTI-RACIAL/OTHER. 13% ARE LATINO/HISPANIC. ALMOST 40% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE CHILDREN UNDER 18, AND 20% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION ARE SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN. WITH A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $32,900, 59% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN HAVE INCOMES BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL COMPARED TO 28% FOR GEORGIA. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM INCLUDES JEFF DAVIS PRIMARY SCHOOL, GRADES PK-2, 881 STUDENTS; JEFF DAVIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, GRADES 3-5, 704 STUDENTS; JEFF DAVIS MIDDLE SCHOOL, GRADES 6-8, 688 STUDENTS; AND JEFF DAVIS HIGH SCHOOL, GRADES 9-12, 860 STUDENTS. JEFF DAVIS STUDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE ON TIME THAN THEIR STATEWIDE COUNTERPARTS. FROM 2013 THROUGH 2017, LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS REALIZED THAT OPIOID USE, ADDICTION AND OVERDOSES AMONG ADULTS WERE INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY COMPARED TO THE REST OF GEORGIA. THE COUNTY\u2019S AGE-ADJUSTED DEATH RATE DUE TO DRUG OVERDOSES WAS 27 PER 100,000, DOUBLE THAT OF THE SOUTHEAST HEALTH DISTRICT, THE 16-COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DISTRICT IN WHICH JEFF DAVIS IS LOCATED, WHICH WAS 13.8 PER 100,000. THE EMERGENCY ROOM RATE FOR DRUG USE DISORDERS DURING THIS TIME WAS THE HIGHEST IN THE STATE WITH 237 PER 100,000 COMPARED TO 163 PER 100,000 FOR GEORGIA. OTHER THAN 12-STEP PROGRAMS, THERE WERE NO TREATMENT OR RECOVERY RESOURCES IN THE COUNTY. THESE CONCERNS LED TO THE FORMATION OF THE JEFF DAVIS SUBSTANCE ABUSE COALITION (JDSAC) IN 2018 WITH THE PURPOSE OF PROMOTING INTERAGENCY, COMMUNITY-WIDE, COLLABORATION TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO REDUCE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RELATED TO SUBSTANCE USE IN THE COUNTY. ITS PRIMARY FOCUS WAS MEETING THE COUNTY\u2019S NEED FOR TREATMENT AND RECOVERY SERVICES. THE COALITION WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE. THEY KNEW YOUTH WERE BEING EXPOSED TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES IN THEIR FAMILIES. SOME WERE IN FOSTER CARE AS A RESULT OF NEGLECT BY DRUG-INVOLVED PARENTS. THESE YOUTH WERE AT HIGH RISK FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES WHICH OFTEN LEAD TO MANY PROBLEM BEHAVIORS INCLUDING SUBSTANCE USE. THE STRESS OF DEALING WITH PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS AND ISOLATION FOR TWO YEARS ADDED TO THE LOCAL ACCESSIBILITY OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, OPIOIDS AND METH INCREASED THE RISK OF YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE. THE COALITION DECIDED TO EXPAND ITS FOCUS TO INCLUDE YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION. THE COUNTY HAD NO SCHOOL, AFTERSCHOOL OR OTHER PROGRAMMING THAT ADDRESSED SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION.

AS NOTED BY FERGUS COUNTY SHERIFF AND CORONER, RICHARD VAUGHN, IN HIS LETTER OF SUPPORT \u201cFROM MY NEARLY 29 YEARS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE I CAN TESTIFY THAT NEARLY ALL PERSONS BOOKED INTO THE FACILITY WERE RELATED TO SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE. THE NARCOTICS ARRESTS ARE NEARLY ALL FELONY CHARGES FOR METHAMPHETAMINE POSSESSION OR DISTRIBUTION WITH HEROIN CHARGES BECOMING MORE REGULAR. THEFT, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, ASSAULT, AND MOST OTHER ARRESTS ARE A RESULT OF SUBSTANCE USE OR ABUSE. ALCOHOL HAS ALWAYS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN ARRESTS. METHAMPHETAMINE HAS AND IS OUTPACING ALCOHOL FOR ARRESTS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. I AM CONFIDENT IN STATING THAT THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN OUR COUNTRY, STATE AND COUNTY IS AN EPIDEMIC. WE OWE IT TO OUR YOUTH TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THIS TREND WITH PROGRAMS THAT WILL EDUCATE AND EMPOWER THEM TO BREAK THE CYCLE.\u201d  THE CYMC IS CONFIDENT IN OUR WORK PLAN.

DUBOIS COUNTY HAS SPECIFICALLY SEEN A SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FILED JUVENILE COURT CASES WHERE MARIJUANA IS THE PRESENTING SUBSTANCE. IN 2017, THE NUMBER OF FILED CASES FOR MARIJUANA POSSESSION WAS 4. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN 2020, THAT NUMBER INCREASED TO 9, AND IN 2021 THAT NEARLY DOUBLED AT 16 FILED CASES.

WE KNOW THAT THE EARLIER YOUTH BEGIN USING ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS, THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO EXPERIENCE ADDICTION IN ADULTHOOD. IT IS OUR MISSION TO EMPOWER YOUTH IN DUBOIS COUNTY TO BE ALCOHOL AND DRUG-FREE. THROUGH ASSESSMENT, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE ROOT CAUSES OF YOUTH ALCOHOL USE IN DUBOIS COUNTY ARE ALCOHOL AVAILABILITY AND FAVORABLE PARENTAL ATTITUDES TOWARD USE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, YOUTH IN DUBOIS COUNTY ARE ACCESSING ALCOHOL AT PARTIES, PEOPLE OVER 21 ARE PROVIDING ALCOHOL TO MINORS, PARENTS ARE ALLOWING YOUTH PARTIES WHERE ALCOHOL IS PRESENT, AND THAT ALCOHOL IS AT THE CENTER OF MANY FAMILY-ORIENTED EVENTS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. THE ROOT CAUSES OF MARIJUANA USE IN DUBOIS COUNTY ARE FAVORABLE YOUTH AND PARENT ATTITUDES, LOW PERCEPTION OF RISK, AND EASE OF ACCESS. WHILE VAPING IS A METHOD OF DRUG DELIVERY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE ITSELF, CARES SPECIFICALLY TARGETS THIS METHOD OF DELIVERY FOR MARIJUANA AND NICOTINE. WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH ASSESSMENT THAT IT IS THE PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH MARIJUANA IS USED BY YOUTH IN DUBOIS COUNTY AND THAT ONE ROOT CAUSE IS A LACK OF PARENTAL AWARENESS REGARDING VAPING DEVICES. DUBOIS COUNTY CARES UTILIZES THE STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS THE COMMUNITY AND DEVELOP A 12-MONTH ACTION PLAN THAT INCLUDES THE SEVEN STRATEGIES OF COMMUNITY-LEVEL CHANGE. WE IMPLEMENT PREVENTION ACTIVITIES TO NOT ONLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF YOUTH WHO ARE CURRENTLY USING ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA BUT TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM DRUG USE INITIATION.

CLINTON COUNTY HAS INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY FOR RURAL INDIANA.  ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS, 16.5% OF ALL RESIDENTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE LATINO.  TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE KNOWN LARGE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED LATINO RESIDENTS AND THE FACT THAT THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS OF FRANKFORT HAS AN ENROLLMENT OF 53.2% LATINO STUDENTS, THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES IT TO BE CLOSER TO 35% OF ALL RESIDENTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE LATINO. \tHCCCC IS A GRASSROOTS COALITION FORMED IN 2006.  OUR MISSION IS REDUCING THE RISK FACTORS THAT LEAD TO CHRONIC DISEASE BY MAKING PERMANENT CHANGES THROUGH POLICY, SYSTEMS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES.

ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN, ACCORDING TO THE 2020 INYS, IS THE DRASTIC INCREASE IN MARIJUANA USE IN THE LAST MONTH FROM 9TH GRADE (7.1%) TO 11TH GRADE (14.3%). THERE IS A LOW SENSE OF PERCEPTION OF HARM AND RISK REGARDING SUBSTANCE MISUSE (2020 INYS). 34.9% OF 10TH GRADERS IN OUR AREA HAVE FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TOWARD DRUG USE (2020 INYS).  IT IS IMPACTING SCHOOL DISCIPLINE INCLUDING EXPULSIONS, CITATIONS FOR THOSE 18 TO 21 YEARS OF AGE, AND INCREASED PROBATION CASES FOR THOSE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE.

A WIDE RANGE OF MEMBERS AND ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATED ON THE COALITION AND TOGETHER, APPLIED FOR AND RECEIVED A 2016 PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION (P&I) GRANT FROM THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES (DHS), BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UNIT. THE P&I GRANT IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL PREVENTION STRATEGIES FOR COMBATING UNDERAGE CONSUMPTION, INCLUDING USING POSITIVE COMMUNITY NORMS (PCN) MESSAGING. THIS MESSAGING FOCUSES ON THE FACT THAT MOST STUDENTS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO USE SUBSTANCES AND CHOOSING HEALTHY ACTIVITIES IN ITS PLACE. DHS HAS BEEN USING THE PCN STRATEGY FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS WITH PROVEN RESULTS IN REDUCING YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE/ABUSE. IN THE 10 YEARS SINCE FARICARES STARTED, THE COALITION HAS STRENGTHENED MANY PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE AND EDUCATE ABOUT REDUCING YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE. THE P&I GRANT WAS EFFECTIVE IN HELPING REDUCE YOUTH ALCOHOL USE, AND HAD A PROMISING START TO REDUCING YOUTH TOBACCO USE VIA E-CIGARETTES BEFORE MOMENTUM WAS LOST IN 2020 DUE TO THE PANDEMIC.

THIS PURPOSE ULTIMATELY EMPOWERS COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO ASSIST YOUTH IN BUILDING RESILIENCY AND REDUCING RISK FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA USE.  UTILIZING THE STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK AND CADCA\u2019S SEVEN STRATEGIES FOR COMMUNITY-LEVEL CHANGE, GCFC WILL ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THEIR 12-MONTH ACTION PLAN. SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES: COALITION MEMBERS WILL BE FULLY INFORMED ABOUT YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE. RETAILERS WILL BECOME MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE DANGERS AND PREVALENCE OF UNDERAGE DRINKING. MORE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WILL BECOME AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF YOUTH MARIJUANA USE. INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES: COALITION MEMBERS WILL HAVE THE SKILLSETS NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL PREVENTION STRATEGIES IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE COALITION\u2019S 12-MONTH ACTION PLAN. SCHOOLS WILL DEVELOP CODES OF CONDUCT REGARDING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION BY YOUTH. ACCESS TO ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA WILL DECREASE FOR YOUTH. YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN PROSOCIAL ACTIVITIES WILL INCREASE. YOUTH LEADERS WILL BECOME MORE SKILLED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE IN ENCOURAGING PEERS NOT TO USE MARIJUANA. LONG-TERM OUTCOMES: THE OVERALL NUMBER AND RETENTION OF COALITION MEMBERS WILL INCREASE.

THE COALITION HAS BEEN STAFF-LED SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 2013, REACHING A TOTAL OF 8,152 CHILDREN WITH DIRECT PREVENTION PROGRAMS DELIVERED PRIMARILY IN SCHOOLS OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS. KDFC IS THE ONLY PRIMARY PREVENTION PROVIDER IN THE COUNTY, THE RESULT OF A STATE-FUNDED GRANT TO THE ORGANIZATION KOSCIUSKO CARES THROUGH ITS FISCAL AGENT, THE OTIS R.

ONLY THEN CAN KDFC ACHIEVE ITS TWIN GOALS TO, FIRST, REACH MORE FAMILIES WITH TIMELY AND CULTURALLY-APPROPRIATE EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND SERVICE PROVISION TARGETING POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND, SECOND, SUSTAIN A MIX OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMS BEYOND A SINGLE FUNDING STREAM.

DOUGLAS COUNTY IS LOCATED IN NORTHWEST WISCONSIN. AT 1,300 SQUARE MILES IN SIZE, IT\u2019S THE FOURTH-LARGEST COUNTY IN WISCONSIN (OUT OF 72 COUNTIES). IT HAS A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 44,295, WHICH RANKS 34TH. THE COUNTY SEAT IS SUPERIOR, WHICH HAS A POPULATION OF 26,223 AND IS PART OF THE DULUTH(MN)/SUPERIOR METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA. THERE ARE MANY SMALLER TOWNS IN DOUGLAS COUNTY, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTY IS HIGHLY RURAL AND SPARSELY POPULATED.      DOUGLAS COUNTY IS BORDERED BY LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE NORTH AND INCLUDES 280,000 ACRES OF FORESTLAND, MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE STATE. THE COUNTY ALSO INCLUDES LAKE NEBAGAMON, A MAJOR RECREATIONAL RESOURCE IN THE REGION, AS WELL AS MANY SMALLER LAKES. THE HIGH QUALITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN DOUGLAS COUNTY MAKE IT A POPULAR DESTINATION FOR SECOND HOMEOWNERS AND TOURISTS.      THE DOUGLAS COUNTY DRUG PREVENTION COALITION WILL FOCUS ON PREVENTING AND REDUCING YOUTH USE OF ALCOHOL, NICOTINE, AND CANNABIS IN THE TWO PRIMARY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN DOUGLAS COUNTY. SUPERIOR SCHOOL DISTRICT IS LOCATED IN SUPERIOR AND SERVES 4,073 K-12 STUDENTS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL DIRECTLY FOCUS ON STUDENTS ATTENDING SUPERIOR MIDDLE SCHOOL AND SUPERIOR HIGH SCHOOL. COMBINED, THESE TWO SCHOOLS HAVE A STUDENT POPULATION OF 2,242. THE SECOND PRIMARY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN DOUGLAS COUNTY IS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF MAPLE, WHICH SERVES 1,282 K-12 STUDENTS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL DIRECTLY FOCUS ON MAPLE STUDENTS ATTENDING NORTHWESTERN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND NORTHWESTERN HIGH SCHOOL. THESE TWO SCHOOLS HAVE A STUDENT POPULATION OF 679.      IN REGARD TO LOCAL CONDITIONS, DOUGLAS COUNTY EXHIBITS HIGHER THAN AVERAGE RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND MULTIPLE OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES. WITHIN A CONTEXT IN WHICH MANY PEOPLE COME AND GO BECAUSE OF THE FORESTS, LAKES, AND TOURISM ECONOMY OF DOUGLAS COUNTY, THESE CONDITIONS COMBINE TO CREATE A CULTURE IN WHICH ADULT SUBSTANCE USE AND MISUSE IS HIGHLY INGRAINED. THIS EXACERBATES CONDITIONS OF POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT AND TAKES A TOLL ON LOCAL YOUTH, BOTH IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND EARLY EXPOSURE TO SUBSTANCE USE.      THE DOUGLAS COUNTY DRUG PREVENTION COALITION FORMED IN 2011 (UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME) IN RESPONSE TO A COMMUNITY SURVEY THAT REVEALED MULTI-LAYERED CONDITIONS AND RISK FACTORS IN REGARD TO SUBSTANCE USE AND MISUSE IN THE COUNTY. THE ORIGINAL GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS CONSISTED OF 18 PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM ARE STILL INVOLVED. THE COALITION HAS NEVER EMPLOYED A COORDINATOR AND CONTINUES TO EXIST BECAUSE OF VOLUNTEERS AND A FEW SMALL GRANTS. THE COALITION IS SEEKING NEW FUNDING TO BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION IT HAS BUILT AND INCREASE IMPACT ON YOUTH USE OF ALCOHOL, NICOTINE, AND CANNABIS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COALITION WILL UTILIZE DFC GRANT FUNDS TO STRENGTHEN AND IMPLEMENT A COLLECTIVE-IMPACT MODEL IN DOUGLAS COUNTY.

THERE IS A LACK OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR THE RESIDENTS OF SOMERS, INCLUDING NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION RESULTING IN INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE THEIR OWN TRANSPORTATION. ALMOST A QUARTER OF SOMERS FAMILIES ARE FACING ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES THAT LEADS TO INCREASED STRESS AND RISK FACTORS IN THE HOME. A PRIMARY POPULATION OF FOCUS IN THE COMMUNITY IS THE \u201cSOMERSVILLE\u201d SECTION OF TOWN, WHERE THERE IS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF POVERTY. THIS SECTION OF TOWN IS WHERE THE OLD MILLS ARE LOCATED THAT WAS ONCE TEMPORARY HOUSING FOR WORKERS PICKING TOBACCO IN THE FIELDS. THE COMMUNITY HAS VERY LIMITED RESOURCES TO SUPPORT POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND HAS RELIED ON VERY LITTLE FUNDING AND NO DEDICATED STAFFING TO OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONCERTED, EVIDENCE-BASED PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. DUE TO THESE LIMITED RESOURCES AND MINIMAL SERVICES FOR YOUTH OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL, THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF STUDENTS USING SUBSTANCES WITH PEERS DURING THEIR UNOCCUPIED TIME. YOUTH MARIJUANA AND ALCOHOL USE ARE THE PRIMARY SUBSTANCES OF CONCERN IN SOMERS. STUDENT SUBSTANCE USE DATA FROM THE 2017 ERASE STUDENT SURVEY, SHOWS THAT PAST 30-DAY ALCOHOL USE WAS HIGHER (17.9%) IN SOMERS THAN THE REGIONAL RATE (15.6%). THIS REMAINS TRUE FOR PAST-MONTH BINGE DRINKING RATES (10.2%, 8.2% RESPECTIVELY).

DURING THE CASE INVESTIGATIONS OF YOUTH CAUGHT WITH MARIJUANA, THE JUVENILE REVIEW BOARD DISCOVERED THAT THE MARIJUANA IS FREQUENTLY OBTAINED FROM A DISPENSARY EITHER FROM A DEALER OR THE YOUTH\u2019S PARENTS. EASE OF ACCESS TO MARIJUANA IS ALREADY A RISK FACTOR THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN SOMERS, WHICH WILL ONLY BE HEIGHTENED FURTHER AS CONNECTICUT ROLLS OUT ITS OWN RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR. MENTAL HEALTH TRANSPORTS HAVE MOSTLY INCREASED EACH YEAR ACROSS THE AGE GROUPS. OVERDOSE TRANSPORTS INCREASED AMONGST TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS IN 2020, POSSIBLY DUE TO ISOLATION AND STRESS BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC. THE MISSION OF SCT IS TO REDUCE AND PREVENT SUBSTANCE USE AMONG YOUTH AND ADULTS BY COLLABORATING WITH THE SOMERS COMMUNITY TO INCREASE AWARENESS, PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT YOUTH AND ADULTS TO ENGAGE IN HEALTHY ACTIVITIES. WITH THE DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES FUNDING, SCT WILL USE THE STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK TO COLLABORATE WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO IMPLEMENT PREVENTION STRATEGIES. SCT WILL FOCUS ITS OBJECTIVES ON REDUCING THE PAST 30-DAY USE OF ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA AS EVIDENCED ON ITS BI-ANNUAL STUDENT USE SURVEY. THE COALITION WILL ACHIEVE ITS GOALS BY IMPLEMENTING THESE STRATEGIES: 1) BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THE SOMERS COMES TOGETHER COALITION TO BE INCLUSIVE OF ALL SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY, 2) DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS TARGETING YOUTH AND THEIR PARENTS TO ADDRESS SOCIAL NORMS ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE, 3) ENHANCE THE SKILLS OF PARENTS IN SOMERS TO SUPPORT SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION AND IMPROVE PROTECTIVE FACTORS, 4) PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE ACTIVITIES FOR YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES TO ENGAGE IN HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES, 5) IMPLEMENT ALCOHOL COMPLIANCE CHECKS AT RETAILS IN SOMERS TO REDUCE YOUTH ACCESS TO ALCOHOL, AND 6) WORK WITH TOWN OFFICIALS TO MODIFY POLICIES TO ENHANCE PROTECTION AGAINST YOUTH MARIJUANA USE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4524b196-d720-dd37-91c3-7cd27621749b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE003422_7523"}, {"internal_id": 151590190, "Award ID": "NH28CE003418", "Award Amount": 250000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-18", "CFDA Number": "93.276", "Description": "HEADSUP DFC - THE HEADSUP DFC WAS AWARDED A FY 2022 DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF $625,000 BY THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY, IN COOPERATION WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION.

OVER TIME, A POSITIVE CULTURE WILL DEVELOP IN ORDER TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY RESILIENT.  NSPD IS SEEKING $125,000 OF YEARLY DFC FUNDING TO PARTIALLY FUND A RWP PROJECT COORDINATOR, FUND SUPPLIES, AND EVALUATE CURRENT EFFORTS TO BETTER REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE WITHIN MUSKEGON COUNTY. WE KNOW THAT EVERY BEHAVIOR HAS A MESSAGE OR NEED BEHIND IT. OUR STUDENTS NEED TO BE GUIDED TOWARD POSITIVE BEHAVIORS AND SAFE CHOICES. THE RWP COALITION COMBINES LAW ENFORCEMENT, EDUCATORS, BUSINESS LEADERS, AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL SECTORS OF SOCIETY FOR ONE THING, OUR YOUTH.  THIS COMMON GOAL, THIS UNIFIED APPROACH, THIS LIFELONG IMPACT, IS DESIGNED TO CONNECT WITH STUDENTS K-12.

THIS COMBINATION PROJECT WITH THE HOUSTON RECOVERY INITIATION AND THE CDC \u201cDRUG FREE COMMUNITIES\u201d GRANT WILL FOCUS ON THE SPRING BRANCH AREA OF HOUSTON, TEXAS IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE AMONG YOUTH.  THE AREA COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS \u201cSPRING BRANCH\u201d RESIDES WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF HOUSTON, TEXAS WITHIN HARRIS COUNTY.  ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES VITAL STATISTICS, HARRIS COUNTY ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY 30% OF ALL THE OVERDOSES FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF TEXAS.  SPRING BRANCH INCLUDES 2 MAJOR ZIP CODES -- 77080 AND 77055 \u2013 AND IS CENTRALLY LOCATED IN THE WEST SIDE OF HOUSTON.  SPRING BRANCH IS BORDERED ON EVERY SIDE BY A MAJOR HIGHWAY \u2013 I-10, BELTWAY 8, HWY 290, AND THE 610 LOOP.  SPRING BRANCH IS A LARGELY IMMIGRANT POPULATION WITH MAJORITY HISPANIC AND ASIAN IMMIGRANTS LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT LINGUISTIC ISOLATION.  THE PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY CURRENT USE AND PERCEPTION ISSUES IN SPRING BRANCH. THIS QUESTIONNAIRE WILL FOCUS ON ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, MARIJUANA (AS REQUIRED BY DFC), PRESCRIPTION PILLS (DUE TO ACCESSIBILITY), \"NON-PRESCRIPTION OPIOID CONTAINING MEDICATIONS\" AND METHAMPHETAMINE (DUE TO THEIR PREVALENCE IN THE HOUSTON AREA).  ACCORDING VITAL STATISTICS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES, HARRIS COUNTY -- WHICH HOUSES THE CITY OF HOUSTON AND THE SPRING BRANCH AREA \u2013 CONTRIBUTES MORE THAN 30% OF THE OVERDOSES FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF TEXAS.  DEMONSTRATING HOW GREAT THE NEED FOR YOUTH SERVICES, HOUSTON IS THE ONLY CITY IN THE US THAT HAS TWO SOBER HIGH SCHOOLS \u2013 FORTIS ACADEMY IN NORTHEAST HOUSTON, AND ARCHWAY ACADEMY IN CENTRAL HOUSTON WHICH IS THE LARGEST SOBER HIGH SCHOOL IN THE NATION.  HOWEVER, WHILE FORTIS ACADEMY IS PAID FOR BY THE CITY OF HOUSTON, THE FACILITY IS 30 MINUTES AWAY VIA A TOLL ROAD AND WOULD LIKELY NOT BE AN OPTION FOR A COMMUNITY THAT RELIES ON WALKING OR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO WORK. ARCHWAY ACADEMY ALSO REQUIRES A 30 MINUTE DRIVE WHICH IS A BARRIER FOR THOSE WITH TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE THE COST OF TUITION IS OFFSET BY DONATIONS, TUITION IS $1000/MONTH WHICH IS PAID FOR BY THE FAMILY. THIS IS DEFINITELY A BARRIER FOR A COMMUNITY WITH A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $45,182 COMPARED TO HARRIS COUNTY $57,791.  WHEN COMPARED TO RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF HOUSTON, HARRIS COUNTY, OR THE UNITED STATES, INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE SPRING BRANCH AREA ARE MORE LIKELY TO LACK HEALTH INSURANCE, GET ROUTINE CHECKUPS (INCLUDING CERVICAL AND COLON CANCER SCREENINGS AND DENTAL CARE), HAVE DIABETES, COPD, OR BE 65+ WITH TOTAL TOOTH LOSS.  THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE LIVING IN POVERTY, ON SNAP (FOOD STAMPS), SPEND MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT, AND HAVE A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $45,182 WHICH DRASTICALLY DIFFERS FROM HARRIS COUNTY ($57,791). SPRING BRANCH FAMILIES ARE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY AS HOUSTON FAMILIES TO BE LIVING IN LINGUISTIC ISOLATION OWING IN A LARGE PART TO THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION. THEY ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN AN APARTMENT VERSUS THEIR OWN HOME, LESS LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED IF THEY ARE FEMALE, AND HAVE HIGHER REPORTS OF POOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CAME FROM THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER AND QUICKLY TOOK TO SOCIAL MEDIA WITH PARENT AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS OUTRAGED. THE STURGIS POLICE CHIEF WAS PUBLIC IN HIS VOICE AGAINST THE EVENT HOWEVER CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS PASSED THE OPEN CONTAINER EVENT WITH A VOTE OF 6-2.      MEADE COUNTY, SOUTH DAKOTA (3,483 SQ. MILES) IS THE THIRD LARGEST COUNTY IN LAND SIZE IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS A COMBINATION OF LOW POPULATION DENSITY, HIGH AGRIBUSINESS EMPLOYMENT, AND LOW PAYING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT, PERSISTENT CHALLENGES IN THE IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY. STURGIS IS HOME TO THE FAMOUS STURGIS MOTORCYCLE RALLY. THIS ANNUAL GATHERING OF ROUGHLY 500,000 BIKERS, BRINGS A UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES. HIGH ON THIS LIST IS UNDERAGE DRINKING. WHILE THE STURGIS MOTORCYCLE RALLY OFFICIALLY RUNS ONLY TEN DAYS EACH YEAR, IT BRINGS MANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS AN INCREASE IN SUBSTANCE AVAILABILITY AND DRUG USE; EXPOSURE TO PUBLIC INTOXICATION; EXPOSURE TO NUDITY AND OTHER BEHAVIORS THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUTH. MANY OF THESE EFFECTS STAY LONG AFTER THE RALLY HAS ENDED.     THERE WERE 329 ARRESTS FOR JUVENILES IN 2019 WHICH IS UP FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR OF 255. ALCOHOL IS INVOLVED IN NEARLY HALF OF ALL REPORTED CRIMES IN SD. ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT DATA PUBLISHED BY THE FBI, OVER 1 IN 10 JUVENILE ARRESTS ARE RELATED TO DRUGS. SOUTH DAKOTA LEADS THE NATION IN JUVENILE DRUG ARRESTS AT 45.75 PER 10,000 PEOPLE. THE NEIGHBORING STATES WERE IN THE LOW TO MID-20?S. MUCH OF THE CRIME IN THE IDENTIFIED AREA OF NEED IS RELATED TO ALCOHOL OR ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE USE. IN 2018 MEADE COUNTY SHERIFF?S OFFICE RECEIVED 6,049 CALLS FOR SERVICE AND THE STURGIS POLICE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED 9,810 CALLS, WHICH RESULTED IN 2,486 ARRESTS.       IN THE SUMMER OF 200 9, A WOMAN WAS ARRESTED FOR A .708 BAC IN STURGIS LIMITS. THE INFORMATION MADE NATIONAL NEWS AND NOW STURGIS HOLDS THE RECORD FOR THE HIGHEST BAC ARREST. WITH THE HELP OF THE DFC FUNDING STURGIS PAL HOPES TO EMPOWER THE COMMUNITY TO CHANGE SOCIAL NORMS BY REMOVING THE STIGMA OF THE STURGIS MOTORCYCLE RALLY AND ITS RESIDUAL EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THE YOUTH?S PERCEPTION OF HARM IN REGARDS TO THE USE OF ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA.     THE GOALS OF THE COALITION ARE: (1) TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF THE STURGIS PAL COALITION AND ITS MEMBERS; AND (2) TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE AMONG YOUTH BY ADDRESSING COMMUNITY RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING STRATEGIES.THE COALITION WILL ACHIEVE ITS GOALS BY IMPLEMENTING THESE STRATEGIES:STRENGTHEN INTERNAL CAPACITY BY ENHANCING SKILLS, LEADERSHIP AND KNOWLEDGE IN BEST PRACTICES OF COALITION BUILDING.MODIFY/CHANGE POLICIES TO STRENGTHEN COALITION?S INTERNAL CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES.INCREASE FUNDING SOURCES AND STAFF EXPERTISE IN GRANT WRITING AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION.EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY ON THE RETAIL ACCESS TO ALCOHOL BY MINORS.INCREASE YOUTH'S KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO MAKE HEALTHIER DECISIONS RELATED TO SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE.INCREASE THE YOUTH?S MOTIVATION AND SKILLS TO SET AND MONITOR MULTIPLE HEALTH BEHAVIOR GOALS BY PROVIDING BRIEF INTEGRATED INTERVENTIONS TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY.REDUCE ACCESS AND ENHANCE BARRIERS TO THE SOCIAL ACCESS OF ALCOHOL TO MINORS.ENFORCE LAWS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ILLEGAL USE OF MARIJUANA AND DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MARIJUANA.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "be056010-baea-da8b-6e33-77c9186bcede-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE003115_7523"}, {"internal_id": 116434947, "Award ID": "NH28CE003114", "Award Amount": 500000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-10", "CFDA Number": "93.276", "Description": "DRUG FREE COMMUNITY COALITION PROJECT FOR SALINA, OK", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OK", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3c1a41d1-2742-77e9-86e9-c9e367d018ba-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE003114_7523"}, {"internal_id": 120383075, "Award ID": "NH28CE003113", "Award Amount": 500000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-21", "CFDA Number": "93.276", "Description": "LAKE OF THE WOODS PREVENTION COALITION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d2f01d4b-9ff3-ab8e-1e3c-d159edf40b0a-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE003113_7523"}, {"internal_id": 116434854, "Award ID": "NH28CE003112", "Award Amount": 375000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-10", "CFDA Number": "93.276", "Description": "ESTABLISHING A DRUG-FREE COMMUNITY BY REDUCING MARIJUANA AND ALCOHOL USE AMONG RURAL YOUTH IN SUMMIT COUNTY, UTAH", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "57c9eeed-8825-e2bc-e4b2-f3fb6648128d-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE003112_7523"}, {"internal_id": 116435250, "Award ID": "NH28CE003111", "Award Amount": 29518.62, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-10", "CFDA Number": "93.276", "Description": "DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES (DFC) SUPPORT PROGRAM", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e6e763fa-9c20-905c-d0fe-9e1ac6e2ef0f-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE003111_7523"}, {"internal_id": 116434877, "Award ID": "NH28CE003110", "Award Amount": 500000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-10", "CFDA Number": "93.276", "Description": "JEFFERSON COUNTY UPP PROJECT TO PREVENT AND REDUCE MARIJUANA AND ALCOHOL USE AMONG COUNTY YOUTH", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "a6e1805a-8389-8ffb-4ae9-42cdce48dd8f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE003110_7523"}, {"internal_id": 116434731, "Award ID": "NH28CE003109", "Award Amount": 375000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-10", "CFDA Number": "93.276", "Description": "ROY COMMUNITIES THAT CARE: DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2763b891-9343-a450-1de7-be33288f3ab8-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE003109_7523"}, {"internal_id": 116435750, "Award ID": "NH28CE003108", "Award Amount": 500000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-10", "CFDA Number": "93.276", "Description": "DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM.

IT IS CONSIDERED THE COUNTY SEAT, MEASURING JUST OVER NINE SQUARE MILES. THE TOWN SITS ALONG THE INTERSTATE 74 CORRIDOR, WHICH CONNECTS INDIANAPOLIS TO CINCINNATI, AND IS ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THESE TWO METROPOLISES, OR ABOUT A 60-MINUTE DRIVE FROM EACH.  GREENSBURG HAS A POPULATION OF 11,916, WITH A POPULATION DENSITY THAT IS 628% HIGHER THAN THE REST OF INDIANA. THE MEDIAN AGE IS 37 WITH NEARLY 30% OF THE POPULATION BELOW THE AGE OF 18. THERE IS AN ALMOST EVEN SPLIT BETWEEN MALES (48.9%) AND FEMALES (51.1%). CULTURALLY AND RACIALLY, THE POPULATION IN GREENSBURG IS MOSTLY WHITE/NON-HISPANIC (93.2%), WITH OTHER POPULATIONS INCLUDING ASIAN (3%), HISPANIC OR LATINO (2.2%), AND AFRICAN AMERICAN (1%).  THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 4,900 HOUSEHOLDS IN GREENSBURG WITH JUST OVER 2,900 OF THEM LIVING IN THE CITY. SOCIOECONOMICALLY, THEIR RESIDENTS HAVE A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $53,436, WITH ALMOST 13% OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY. IN FACT, MORE THAN 50% OF GREENSBURG CHILDREN RECEIVE FREE OR REDUCED SCHOOL LUNCHES.  FURTHER, 91.4% OF ADULTS HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA, BUT ONLY 19.5% OF THEM GO ON TO OBTAIN A SECONDARY DEGREE. THIS RATE IS ALMOST 6.5% LESS THAN FOR THE STATE OF INDIANA. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES THAT HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE: GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES TEND TO STAY IN THE GREENSBURG AREA. WHILE THERE ISN?T MUCH NIGHT LIFE OR ENTERTAINMENT IN THE LOCAL AREA, EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY. FREE OUTDOOR SUMMER MOVIES TAKE PLACE MONTHLY ON THE COURTHOUSE LAWN, A WEEKLY FARMER?S MARKET SPARKS REGULAR TRAFFIC TO THE DOWNTOWN AREA, AND A 3.1 MILE NEWLY PAVED BIKING/WALKING TRAIL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, A LACK OF YOUTH RECREATION AND ENTERTAINMENT CAN LEAD TO A SENSE OF LOW COMMUNITY ATTACHMENT AND YOUTH BECOMING BORED, WHICH CAN THEN LEAD  TO IMPULSIVENESS AND SENSATION SEEKING, ALL KNOWN AS RISK FACTORS THAT CAN LEAD TO YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE.THE COMPANIES THAT OFFER THE MOST JOBS IN GREENSBURG ARE IN MANUFACTURING. THESE JOBS ARE MOSTLY FILLED BY TEMP AGENCIES AND DO NOT PROVIDE BENEFITS, WHICH CAN PERPETUATE THE CYCLE OF POVERTY. POVERTY OFTEN CORRELATES WITH SUBSTANCE USE, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POVERTY BEGIN AT AN EARLY AGE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA.

BEAVER CITY IS THE COUNTY SEAT OF BEAVER COUNTY, AND WAS SETTLED IN 1856 BY MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS (LDS/MORMON) FAITH.BEAVER IS APPROXIMATELY 200 MILES FROM SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH AND 225 MILES FROM LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. BEAVER IS A GATEWAY TO LOCAL CANYONS AND MOUNTAIN RANGES. BEAVER IS AN ACCESS POINT TO FISHLAKE NATIONAL FOREST WHICH OFFERS A VARIETY OF OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES SUCH AS CAMPING, FISHING, HUNTING, AND WINTER SPORTS. RESIDENTS OF BEAVER HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND ARE VERY PROUD OF THE BEAUTIFUL GEOLOGY THEIR HOME HAS TO OFFER.THE COMMUNITY OF BEAVER IS INTERCONNECTED WITH MULTIPLE NEARBY COMMUNITIES. THE MAJOR NEIGHBORING CITY IN THE COUNTY, MILFORD, IS ABOUT 30 MILES WEST, BUT IS DIFFERENT FROM BEAVER IN OVERALL COMMUNITY DEMOGRAPHICS AND CULTURE. THE YOUTH OF BEAVER AND MILFORD SERVE AS THE MAJOR SOURCE OF CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE TWO OTHERWISE SEPARATED COMMUNITIES. ALTHOUGH BEAVER HAS ITS OWN HOSPITAL, LOCAL GROCERY STORE, AND VARIOUS OTHER BASIC SERVICES, RESOURCES FOR THE COMMUNITY ARE STILL LIMITED. MANY BEAVER CITY RESIDENTS TRAVEL TO NEIGHBORING COUNTIES FOR OTHER BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS LARGER-SCALE GROCERY SHOPPING, SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES, AND FAMILY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.BEAVER CITY IS HOME TO MOST OF THE POPULATION OF BEAVER COUNTY. THE 2010 CENSUS REPORTS THAT OF THE APPROXIMATE 6,600 PEOPLE LIVING IN BEAVER COUNTY, AN ESTIMATED 3,100 OF THOSE PEOPLE LIVE IN BEAVER CITY. 93% OF RESIDENTS ARE WHITE (NON-HISPANIC), WITH 5% HISPANIC, 1% NATIVE AMERICAN, AND 1% OTHER. THE MEDIAN AGE IS 35, WITH APPROXIMATELY 2,050 ADULTS. 25% OF THOSE ADULTS ARE CONSIDERED SENIORS. HOME OWNERSHIP IS HIGH IN BEAVER, WITH APPROXIMATELY 74% OF ALL RESIDENTS OWNING AS OPPOSED TO RENTING THEIR HOMES. 89% OF RESIDENTS HAVE ATTAINED AT LEAST A HIGH  SCHOOL DIPLOMA, WITH 16% ALSO ATTAINING A BACHELORS DEGREE. BEAVER HAS SOME INCOME AND POVERTY DISPARITIES. AVERAGE INCOME FOR MALES IS $46,563 WHILE FEMALES AVERAGE $24,792, AND POVERTY AMONG WHITES AT 5% WHILE HISPANIC RESIDENTS EXPERIENCE POVERTY AT ABOUT 17%.THE DOMINANT FAITH OF BEAVER IS THE LATTER DAY SAINTS (MORMON), WITH OVER 50% OF RESIDENTS IDENTIFYING AS LDS. THE LDS RELIGION HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE CULTURE AND NORMS RELATED TO SUBSTANCE USE, AS LDS FAITHFUL ARE REQUIRED TO ABSTAIN FROM ATODS. FOR THIS REASON, BEAVER'S ILLICIT DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE RATES ARE SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE NATION; HOWEVER, THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO DISCUSS OR ADDRESS SUBSTANCE USE AMONG ADOLESCENTS. THE RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE OF THE LDS FAITH HAS PROVIDED BOTH RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.BEAVER CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH TWO EXITS ON I-15. I-15 IS A MAJOR DRUG TRAFFICKING CORRIDOR, WHICH INFLUENCES THE AVAILABILITY OF PROBLEM SUBSTANCES AND PLACES AN ADDED STRAIN ON OUR LOCAL SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND HIGHWAY PATROL. THE SIZE OF THE COUNTY AND THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WILDERNESS AREA ALSO CREATE STRAIN, AS LOCAL SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES CAN BE AS MUCH AS TWO HOURS AWAY FROM THEIR NEAREST BACKUP, AND ENFORCEMENT OF SOME DRUG PROBLEMS LIKE UNDERAGE DRINKING CAN BE PROBLEMATIC.YOUTH IN BEAVER ARE USING TOBACCO PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY E-CIGARETTES, AND DRINKING ALCOHOL UNDERAGE AT ALARMING RATES. ALCOHOL USE IS CONSIDERED A SOCIAL NORM, AS YOUTH OFTEN OBTAIN ALCOHOL WITH PARENTAL PERMISSION. BEAVER WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE SUPPORTIVE LOCAL LEGISLATORS PASS A CITY ORDINANCE THAT BANNED SPECIALTY VAPE SHOPS FROM COMING TO THE CITY, BUT YOUTH ARE STILL BOMBARDED BY E-CIGARETTE ADVERTISEMENTS AND A RISING ADULT USE RATE.

ITS LACK OF INDUSTRY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO ITS STATUS AS A TIER 1 (MOST ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED), WITH A 16.2% POVERTY LEVEL.?ONSLOW COUNTY, POPULATION 197,938, IS HOME TO CAMP LEJEUNE AND NEW RIVER AIR STATION GIVING ONSLOW THE YOUNGEST AVERAGE AGED POPULATION (22) IN THE NATION. ONSLOW HAS SIX MUNICIPALITIES AND HAS HAD ONE OF THE STATE?S HIGHEST STATISTICS FOR ALCOHOL-RELATED CRASHES AND FATALITIES. IN SPITE OF THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF CAMP LEJEUNE, ONSLOW HAS A 15.1% POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THE YOUTH WHO SERVE IN THIS COUNTY ARE MILITARY DEPENDEN TS AND OFTEN FACE TIME AWAY FROM THEIR PARENT(S) DUE TO DEPLOYMENTS, BOTH STATESIDE AS WELL AS OVERSEAS. THIS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TOWARDS SUBSTANCE USE.?PAMLICO COUNTY, POPULATION 12,726, IS ONE OF THE LESSER POPULATED COUNTIES, HAS ITS ROOTS IN FISHING AND FARMING. PAMLICO IS A TIER 2 COMMUNITY, AND ALSO LACKS MAJOR INDUSTRY.AN OVERALL DEMOGRAPHIC PICTURE SHOWS THE ETHNICITY OF OUR COUNTIES RANGING FROM 62-89% CAUCASIAN, 6-32% AFRICAN AMERICAN, 3-8% HISPANIC, AND 1% NATIVE AMERICAN OR ASIAN BACKGROUND. FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TOWARDS ALCOHOL HAVE FUELED UNDERAGE DRINKING IN OUR AREA, WITH JACKSONVILLE, NC DESIGNATED THE DRUNKEST CITY IN NORTH CAROLINA FIVE YEARS IN A ROW, AND THE DESIGNATION OF ONSLOW COUNTY AS NUMBER TWELVE IN THE NATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG MISUSE, HIGHLIGHTS THE LOW PERCEPTION OF HARM FROM SUCH USE. PARENTAL PERMISSIVENESS TOWARDS UNDERAGE DRINKING FURTHER COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEMS FACED RELATED TO UNDERAGE DRINKING.HURRICANE FLORENCE DEVASTATED OUR COUNTIES IN 2018. MANY AREAS OF THE COUNTIES ARE STILL REBUILDING, SCHOOLS ARE STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION, AND THERE ARE FAMILIES STILL DISPLACED, WITH MANY LIVING WITH RELATIVES, OR IN LOCAL HOTELS.

COUNTY SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION PARTNERSHIPLINCOLN COUNTY, MAINE IS MADE UP 19 TOWNS, INCLUDING ONE OFF-SHORE ISLAND COMMUNITY, SPREAD ACROSS OVER 450 SQUARE MILES OF LAND, WITH 450 MILES OF ROCKY COASTLINE IN THE MID-COAST REGION. OUR POPULATION IS ABOUT 34,000. WE HAVE NO CITIES IN OUR COUNTY, AND THE NEAREST ?BOX STORE? IS AT LEAST A 30-40-MINUTE DRIVE EITHER EAST, WEST, OR NORTH. THE COASTAL GEOGRAPHY, WITH ITS MANY PENINSULAS JUTTING MILES INTO HARBORS, CONTRIBUTES TO STRONG LOCAL VILLAGE CULTURE, AS WELL AS ISOLATION. WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC DIVIDE WHICH OUR YOUTH COALITION MEMBER DESCRIBED AS ?LOBSTER BOATS AND SAIL BOATS?. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOMES OF SOMERVILLE (AN INLAND VILLAGE) AND BOOTHBAY HARBOR ARE $39,063 AND $81,250, RESPECTIVELY. THE BEAUTY OF THE AREA BRINGS TOURISTS, AND WEALTHY RETIREES, MAKING OUR COUNTY THE OLDEST IN MAINE (ALMOST 28% OF OUR POPULATION IS 65 OR OLDER). YET 18.5% OF OUR CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN POVERTY (PRE-COVID), AND THERE EXISTS A ?BRAIN DRAIN? OF YOUNG PEOPLE LEAVING FOR COLLEGE AND RARELY COMING BACK DUE TO A SCARCITY OF JOBS. ALMOST 97% OF RESIDENTS DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS WHITE/NON-HISPANIC. LINCOLN COUNTY HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF YOUTH WHO IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ IN MAINE, AND MANY LGBTQ ADULTS AND FAMILIES ARE INTEGRATED INTO COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF ACCEPTANCE. WHILE SMALL TOWN LIFE CREATES SUPPORT AND A SENSE OF DUTY TO CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER, OUR COMMUNITIES ARE CHALLENGED BY LONG-STANDING RELIANCE ON SUBSTANCES TO MANAGE STRESS IN THE FACE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PRESSURES. ACCORDING TO THE 2018 LINCOLN COUNTY HEALTH PROFILE, OUR CHRONIC HEAVY DRINKING RATE FOR ADULTS IS ABOUT 9%, COMPARED TO 7.6% (MAINE) AND 5.9% (US), AND IS COMMON AMONG MULTI-GENERATIONAL FAMILIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE SEAFARING COMMUNITIES. WITH THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF MARIJUANA IN MAINE, WE EXPECT OUR FIRST RETAIL MARIJUANA SHOPS TO OPEN IN SUMMER OF 2020. YOUNG  CHILDREN GROWING UP IN FAMILIES WHO WORK IN THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY ARE CONFUSED WHEN PROVIDED PREVENTION EDUCATION, WITH ONE SIXTH GRADER NOTING, ?MY PARENTS FINALLY HAVE A STEADY PAYCHECK? FROM THEIR MARIJUANA BUSINESS. THESE FACTORS ARE JUST SOME OF THE CONTEXT WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING TO OUR YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE.THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO CONTINUE ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITY IN PREVENTING AND REDUCING YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE, BUILDING ON OUR SUCCESSES OF THE PAST AND TAKING A DEEPER LOOK INTO SPECIFIC DISPARITIES, SOLIDIFYING OUR SYSTEMS FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS, AND EQUIPPING THE ADULTS IN OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO MORE EFFECTIVELY HELP OUR YOUTH MAKE HEALTHY, LOW RISK CHOICES. WE SEEK TO REDUCE THE PERCENT OF OUR YOUTH WHO REPORT DRINKING ALCOHOL AND USING MARIJUANA IN THE PAST 30 DAYS, AND TO INCREASE THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES. WE WILL CREATE A ROBUST SYSTEM TO SUPPORT OUR RETAILERS SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO THE RIGHT THING, AND WE WILL MORE FULLY INCORPORATE RESTORATIVE PRACTICES INTO OUR SCHOOLS, ORGANIZATIONS, AND COMMUNITY.

THE COALITION'S GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH AND STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY COLLABORATION IN SUPPORT OF LOCAL EFFORTS TO PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE. - THE COUNCIL ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND YOUTH (CSAY) HAS APPLIED FOR A FISCAL YEAR 2020 DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF $125,000, FOR THE MOUNT PLEASANT AREA.  THE COALITION SERVES MOUNT PLEASANT, PENNSYLVANIA, A COMMUNITY OF 17,374.  THE MOUNT PLEASANT AREA SCHOOL DISTRICT ENCOMPASSES APPROXIMATELY 106 SQUARE MILES AND INCLUDES MOUNT PLEASANT BOROUGH, MOUNT PLEASANT TOWNSHIP, DONEGAL BOROUGH AND DONEGAL TOWNSHIP.  AS A WHOLE, THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS CONSIDERED LARGELY SUBURBAN, WITH A RESIDENTIAL POPULATION OF 17,374.  FURTHERMORE, THE DISTRICT HAS AN ENROLLMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 2,066 STUDENTS.  THE MEDIAN AGE IN THIS COMMUNITY IS 46.1 YEARS AND 9.9% OF THE RESIDENTS LIVE IN POVERTY, A RATE COMPARABLE TO THE COUNTY RATE OF 10.3%. HOWEVER, WITHIN MOUNT PLEASANT BOROUGH, THE POVERTY RATE RISES TO 12.9%, WHICH IS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE NATIONAL POVERTY RATE OF 12.3%.  THE RACIAL MAKEUP OF THE COMMUNITY IS 97.9% WHITE OR CAUCASIAN, 1.0% FROM TWO OR MORE RACES, 0.6% ASIAN, AND 0.4% BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN.  UNDERAGE DRINKING HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT, ONGOING PROBLEM FOR THE MOUNT PLEASANT AREA, DUE TO THE RURAL LOCATIONS THAT ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE.  THE DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES YEARS 1-5 GRANT FOCUSED ON UNDERAGE DRINKING AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE. CSAY WORKED DILIGENTLY TO ADDRESS THESE TWO SUBSTANCES AND IS NOW SEEING A SHIFT TO A SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEM OF MARIJUANA USE BY THE YOUTH OF THE MT. PLEASANT COMMUNITY. A COUNTY-WIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED AND THROUGH FOCUS GROUPS AND SURVEY DATA, IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THAT THE LEGALIZATION OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA, AS WELL AS TALK OF LEGALIZING RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, HAVE INCREASED USE AMONG YOUTH.  PARENTAL APPROVAL OF MARIJUANA USE AMONG YOUTH HAS ALSO INCREASED.  CSAY HAS ACTIVELY BEEN WORKING ON BUILDING CAPACITY BY SHARING ITS NEEDS ASSESSMENT INFORMATION WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND WORKING ON A NINE-MONTH ACTION PLAN.THE FIRST FIVE YEARS ENABLED CSAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TECH NICAL ASSISTANCE AND RAMP UP COALITION ACTIVITIES, WITH STRONG YOUTH PARTICIPATION.  CSAY HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES AND ESTABLISHED PARTNERSHIPS IN THE COMMUNITY. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS FACTORS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE AND CHANGE THE CULTURE AND CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH DECISIONS ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE ARE MADE, THE CONTINUATION OF DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES YEARS 6-10 IS ESSENTIAL. IT WOULD ALLOW CSAY TO ENHANCE COALITION MEMBERSHIP, AS WELL AS INCREASE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD ADDRESS UNDERAGE DRINKING AND MARIJUANA USE AMONG YOUTH AGE 18 AND YOUNGER.

THE CURRENT POPULATION OF HOMEWOOD IS 25,678 WHICH CONSISTS OF 10,092 HOUSEHOLDS; 3,039 WITH CHILDREN UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE.   HOMEWOOD IS A SOUGHT AFTER PLACE TO LIVE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. IT IS PROXIMATE TO THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM WHICH IS THE OPERATION CENTER FOR SEVERAL LARGE EMPLOYERS. INTERSTATE 65 TRANSECTS THE CITY, MAKING COMMUTE TIME MINIMAL. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NATION OFTEN RECEIVING RECOGNITION IN NATIONAL SCHOOL RANKINGS. HOMEWOOD CITY SCHOOLS HAS THREE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, ONE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND ONE HIGH SCHOOL; THE DISTRICT SERVES APPROXIMATELY 4,200 STUDENTS. THE CITY ALSO BOASTS AN EXCELLENT PARKS & RECREATION PROGRAM AND PUBLIC LIBRARY.  DIVERSITY IS ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF HOMEWOOD THAT IS CELEBRATED. MUCH OF THE CULTURAL DIVERSITY IS DRIVEN BY THE CITY?S PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD RENOWNED UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM MEDICAL FACILITY AND TEACHING HOSPITAL. INDIVIDUALS COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO WORK AND STUDY HERE. IN 2010, THE RACIAL MAKEUP OF HOMEWOOD WAS 78% CAUCASIAN, 14% AFRICAN-AMERICAN, 2% ASIAN, 4% FROM OTHER RACES, AND 2% FROM TWO OR MORE RACES. 4% OF THE POPULATION IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS HISPANIC OR LATINO.

ONE SIGNIFICANT AREA OF DIVERSITY IS THE SOCIOECONOMIC RANGE AMONG FAMILIES IN HOMEWOOD. ACCORDING TO THE 2018 DATA, THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IS $71,494; HOWEVER, 28% OF STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL LUNCH ASSISTANCE.  ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT AREA OF DIVERSITY IS IN THE HOUSING COMPOSITION OF HOMEWOOD. HOUSING TYPES RANGE FROM GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED APARTMENTS TO AFFLUENT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS. ACCORDING TO CURRENT POPULATION DATA, HOMEWOOD HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST POPU LATION DENSITIES IN ALABAMA. IT IS A LAND-LOCKED, URBAN CITY THAT IS ONLY 8.3 SQUARE MILES, BORDERED ON ALL SIDES BY OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.   HOMEWOOD ALSO BOASTS A DIVERSE FAITH COMMUNITY. THE FAITH COMMUNITY INCLUDES SEVERAL CATHOLIC CHURCHES, NUMEROUS PROTESTANT CHURCHES, AND THE BIRMINGHAM ISLAMIC SOCIETY. NO JEWISH SYNAGOGUES ARE LOCATED IN HOMEWOOD PROPER, BUT SEVERAL IN THE NEIGHBORING CITY OF BIRMINGHAM.  HOMEWOOD IS ALSO DIVERSE IN THE RESIDENTS? POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS. BECAUSE ALABAMA IS A ?RED? STATE, MANY HOMEWOOD RESIDENTS PUT BLUE DOT STICKERS ON THEIR CARS. THE BLUE DOT SYMBOLIZES THEIR ?BLUE? PARTY AFFILIATION IN A SEA OF RED.  THE HOMEWOOD COMMUNITY FACES A SERIOUS THREAT DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ILLEGAL DRUGS. THE BIRMINGHAM METRO AREA (INCLUDING HOMEWOOD) IS ONE OF ONDCPS FIVE HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS (GULF COAST). THIS COMMUNITY LEVEL THREAT TRANSLATES TO ELEVATED SUBSTANCE USE BY HOMEWOOD YOUTH WHICH IN 2015 WAS HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ACCORDING TO THE PRIDE NATIONAL SUMMARY.

AS OF THE 2010 US CENSUS, 11,097 HARDWORKING, FAMILY FOCUSED, CARING RESIDENTS LIVE WITHIN OUR 3.2 SQUARE MILE BORDERS. IT WAS ONCE HEADQUARTERS TO GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON AND OUR MOST NOTABLE RESIDENT WAS THE FAMOUS DIRECTOR CECIL B. DEMILLE. AS WIKIPEDIA DESCRIBES, PL IS AN OUTER-RING SUBURB OF NEW YORK CITY, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES NORTHWEST OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN. WITH SUCH A CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE OF THE WORLD?S LARGEST CITIES, SOME MAY ASSUME PL IS A BUSTLING URBAN SUBURB, BUT IT IS NOT. PL IS A SMALL SUBURBAN COMMUNITY, WITH A QUAINT DOWN TOWN AND EASY ACCESS TO THREE RUSHING RIVERS, THE RAMAPO, PEQUANNOCK AND WANAQUE, AS WELL AS A LARGE LAKE AND NUMEROUS HIKING TRAILS THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS LOCATED IN OUR BACKYARD. FORMED ON FEBRUARY 26, 1895, PL WAS THE FIRST BOROUGH TO BE FORMED IN PASSAIC COUNTY.  LIKE MOST SMALL COMMUNITIES, PL IS LARGELY BASED AROUND ORGANIZED LONGSTANDING EVENTS, INCLUDING HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS, SENIOR CITIZEN GATHERINGS, AND VARIOUS GROUP ACTIVITIES ORGANIZED BY THE PL RECREATION COMMITTEE. THERE IS A PUBLIC LIBRARY, WITH REGULARLY SCHEDULED READING GROUPS AND ONE OF THE AREA?S LARGEST CATHOLIC CHURCHES, ST. MARY'S, IS LOCATED DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM BOROUGH HALL. THERE IS A LARGE WELL-USED YOUTH/TEEN CENTER, WHICH HAS MANY DANCES AND EVENTS FOR OUR YOUTH. POMPTON DAY, THE TOWN'S MAJOR END-OF-SUMMER EVENT, TAKES PLACE EVERY LABOR DAY WEEKEND, WITH THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS ATTENDING. OTHER POPULAR TOWN EVENTS ARE THE HOLIDAY STROLL, MEMORIAL DAY PARADE, AND TRICK-OR-TREATING DOWNTOWN. PL HAS LONG ESTABLISHED TRADITIONS THAT ARE ORGANIZED AND ATTENDED BY MULTIPLE GENERATIONS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. UNFORTUNATELY, ALONG WITH MANY OF OUR GREAT COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS, PL IS HOME TO A HISTORY OF FEW ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE LONG SINCE DISBANDED IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT NJ. THESE GROUPS CONSIDER THEMSELVES  AS LOCAL FRATERNITY BASED SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. ESTABLISHED ALMOST 50 YEARS AGO, THESE STARTED AS CLUBS THAT WERE CONNECTED TO OUR HIGH SCHOOL AND WERE COMPRISED OF STUDENT MEMBERS FROM PL AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. UNLIKE MOST HIGH SCHOOL CLUBS, MEMBERS STAYED ACTIVE WITH MANY ADULT MEMBERS WELL INTO THEIR 60S. SIMILAR TO OTHER ADULT ORGANIZATIONS, THESE FRATERNITIES HAVE NUMEROUS ALCOHOL RELATED CELEBRATIONS. YOUTH FRATERNITY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE CELEBRATIONS, PERMITTED, AND EVEN ENCOURAGED TO DRINK. THE LONG HISTORY AND PAST POPULARITY OF THESE FRATERNITIES IS DEEPLY ENGRAINED IN THE CULTURE OF OUR COMMUNITY, AND DUE TO THE FRATERNITIES MAKING THE UNHEALTHY CHOICE EASIER IT FURTHER BECOMES THE COMMUNITY NORM.ANOTHER EQUALLY AS DANGEROUS NORM IS BEGINNING TO TAKE HOLD, THE USE OF MARIJUANA AND ITS DERIVATIVES AMONG OUR YOUTH. MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY IS AWARE OF THE LINGERING POSSIBILITY OF THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA, RESIDENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPENING OF A LOCAL CBD STORE AND VAPE STORE IN OUR SMALL DOWNTOWN. MOST OF THE RESIDENTS DO NOT REALIZE THE LARGE SHIFT IN OUR COMMUNITY RELATED TO MARIJUANA. DRIVEN BY CONFUSING MESSAGES REGARDING MARIJUANA AND A NATIONAL PUSH TO LEGALIZE, THE PERCEPTION OF RISK AMONG OUR YOUTH IS DECREASING AT ALARMING RATES. SIMILAR TO THE FREQUENT UNDERAGE DRINKING CONDONED BY OUR ENTRENCHED COMMUNITY-BASED FRATERNITY TRADITIONS, A CULTURE SUPPORTIVE TO MARIJUANA USE HAS OPENED SHOP RIGHT IN OUR DOWNTOWN. THE POMPTON LAKES PREVENTION COALITION (PLPC) HAS DEDICATED ITS WORK TO FOSTER A DRUG-FREE COMMUNITY AND ESTABLISH A NEW CULTURE AND TRADITION THAT MAKES THE HEALTHY CHOICE FOR OUR YOUTH THE MORE POPULAR CHOICE. THE PLPC EDUCATES COMMUNITY MEMBERS, INCREASING HEALTH AND WELLNESS, REDUCING STIGMA, AND PROVIDING YOUTH AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN HEALTHY, POSITIVE WAYS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NJ", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8f8653d7-334d-1b37-a221-730882292a4f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NH28CE002998_7523"}, {"internal_id": 116434757, "Award ID": "NH28CE002997", "Award Amount": 500000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-12-10", "CFDA Number": "93.276", "Description": "BARNEGAT COMMUNITIES THAT CARE -

TODAY THE DISTRICT COVERS AN AREA OF 70 SQUARE MILES REACHING FIVE TOWNSHIPS.   THE COMMUNITY FINDS ITS IDENTITY IN THE SCHOOLS.  THERE IS NO DOWNTOWN SHOPPING AREA OR CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT.  YOU CANNOT FIND ?REETHS-PUFFER? ON A MAP.  SINCE OUR MASCOT IS THE ROCKETS, OUR COMMUNITY HAS TAKEN ON THE INFORMAL IDENTITY OF ?ROCKET CITY.?  THIS MONIKER BECOMES OUR RALLYING CRY AS WE SUPPORT OUR STATE CHAMPION MARCHING BAND, LITTLE LEAGUE SOCCER TEAMS, ROBOTICS COMPETITORS, AND SO MANY VARSITY ATHLETIC TEAMS.  REETHS-PUFFER SCHOOLS BOASTS A 91% GRADUATION RATE AND A 4% DROP OUT RATE.  HOWEVER REFERRALS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND EXPULSION RATES ARE HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE WITH SUBSTANCE USE, VAPING AND OTHER DRUG USE OFTEN A FACTOR.  REETHS-PUFFER ADMINISTRATORS AND STAFF HAVE INDICATED AN ALARMING RATE OF VAPING ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND REGULARLY CONFISCATE VAPING DEVICES.  THE POPULATION OF THE REETHS-PUFFER DISTRICT IS 21,660 WITH 3,683 STUDENTS ENROLLED.  STUDENTS ENROLLED ARE 87% WHITE, 4.8% AFRICAN AMERICAN, 4% HISPANIC, AND 3.5% IDENTIFY AS TWO OR MORE RACES.  HALF (50%) OF FAMILIES IN THE DISTRICT QUALIFY AS ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED, AND OVER 11% OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY.  INCOME DATA SPECIFIC TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS NOT AVAILABLE, THOUGH WE ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH COUNTY AVERAGES.  MUSKEGON COUNTY?S MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS $48,885, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN STATE-WIDE AT $54,840.  PERVASIVE DRINKING, SMOKING AND OUTDOOR PARTIES AND FESTIVALS HAVE BEEN A COMMUNITY NORM.  IN THE EARLY 2000S, MUSKEGON COUNTY WAS KNOWN AS THE \"BEER TENT CAPITAL OF THE WORLD\"  WITH HEAVY RATES OF BOTH ADULT  AND YOUTH RATES OF ALCOHOL USE.   IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, THE ADULT RATES OF SMOKING AND DRINKING HAVE DECLINED, HOWEVER HEROIN, PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE AND MARIJUANA USE REMAIN STEADY.   MUSKEGON COUNTY HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT DROPS IN YOUTH SMOKING AND ALCOHOL USE; HOWEVER YOUTH HAVE SHIFTED TO SMOKING MARIJUANA AND VAPING TOBACCO PRODUCTS. MUSKEGON COUNTY IS RECOGNIZED AS A HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREA (HIDTA), WITH EXCELLENT COORDINATION AMONG ITS LAW ENFORCEMENT, COURT, AND JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS, WITH MULTIPLE SPECIALTY COURTS.   IN THE 2019/20 SCHOOL YEAR, THE MOST-USED DRUGS AMONG TEENS IN REETHS-PUFFER WERE ALCOHOL, MARIJUANA, AND VAPING NICOTINE. AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, 17.3% REPORTED ALCOHOL USE IN THE PAST 30 DAYS, 15.7% MARIJUANA, AND 20.4% USE OF AN ELECTRONIC VAPING DEVICE.

TCDOP AND PURE PERFORMANCE, THE YOUTH COALITION, WILL DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES THAT WILL EXPAND ON THE SUCCESSFUL APPROACHES CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND IMPLEMENT NEW STRATEGIES TO IMMERSE THE COMMUNITY WITH PURE PERFORMANCE PRINCIPLES. OUTCOMES TARGET DEVELOPING NEW, WHILE MAINTAINING CURRENT COMMUNITY COLLABORATIONS. YOUTH ALCOHOL USE OUTCOMES WILL TARGET DECREASING CURRENT USE AND BINGE DRINKING, INCREASING PERCEPTION OF RISK/HARM AND DELAYING ONSET OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. TOBACCO OUTCOMES WILL FOCUS ON DECREASING CURRENT USE OF TOBACCO WHILE INCREASING YOUTH PERCEPTION OF RISK/HARM. THE PROJECT WILL CONCENTRATE ACTIVITIES ON EDUCATION, REDUCING ACCESS, CHANGING CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES.

RURAL TAYLOR COUNTY, IN NORTH-CENTRAL WISCONSIN, IS A 1,000 SQUARE MILE RECTANGLE WITH A POPULATION OF 20, 653 (2018 U.S. CENSUS). SEVENTY THREE PERCENT OF THE AREA IS FOREST AND WET LAND; 21 PERCENT IS DAIRY AND CROP FARMLAND, AND SIX PERCENT IS DEVELOPED LAND. ONE-THIRD OF THE COUNTY IS IN THE CHEQUAMEGON NATIONAL FOREST WITH REMOTE PAVED AND GRAVEL ROAD ACCESS TO LAKES, RIVERS AND WILDLIFE. THE RURAL NATURE OF THE COUNTY, WITH RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE FORESTED AREA IS A DRAW FOR OUTDOOR SPORT ENTHUSIASTS AND SUPPORTS A CULTURE OF ALCOHOL ACCEPTANCE. HUNTING SEASON IS A HIGH-RISK PERIOD FOR YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE.  GRAVEL PITS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY ARE PRIME AREAS FOR SECLUDED YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE PARTIES. MEDFORD IS THE LARGEST CITY, AND THE COUNTY SEAT, WITH A POPULATION OF 4,364 LOCATED  IN THE SOUTH EAST CORNER. TWO OTHER CENTRAL COMMUNITIES ARE GILMAN, ON THE WESTERN BOARDER OF THE COUNTY WITH A POPULATION OF 434 AND RIB LAKE, POPULATION 910, LOCATED IN THE NORTH EAST CORNER OF THE COUNTY. THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM CONSISTS OF TWO-LANE PAVED AND RUSTIC ROADS. WISCONSIN HIGHWAY 29, FIFTEEN MILES SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERN COUNTY BORDER, CONNECTS DIRECTLY WITH MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, APPROXIMATELY THREE HOURS WEST. CHICAGO ILLINOIS IS FIVE HOURS SOUTH ON INTERSTATE 39.NINETY SIX PERCENT OF TAYLOR COUNTY?S POPULATION IS CAUCASIAN. THREE PERCENT ARE BLACK, ASIAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN. TWO PERCENT OF THE COUNTY?S POPULATION IS OF HISPANIC DESCENT.  OF THE TOTAL POPULATION, 51% ARE MALE, 49% FEMALE. APPROXIMATELY 24% OF THE POPULATION IS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG EUROPEAN DESCENT, CHRISTIANITY IS THE PROMINENT RELIGION IN TAYLOR COUNTY. THERE ARE NO CLEAR STATISTICS ON GENDER IDENTITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUTH. POVERTY IS AT 10% FOR THE COUNTY, BUT FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18, THE POVERTY RATE IS 16%. TWENTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN IN TAYLOR COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH PROGRAM. SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN ATTEND ONE OF THE THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY. MEDFORD IS THE LARGEST WITH A STUDENT POPULATION OF 2,142, RIB LAKE AND GILMAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MUCH SMALLER WITH STUDENT POPULATIONS OF 468 AND 306 (2019-2020). ALL THREE DISTRICTS USE EXTENSIVE BUSSING SERVICES TO TRANSPORT STUDENTS FROM THE REMOTE RURAL AREAS. THE COUNTY UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 3.4%. THE COMMUNITY DEPENDS HEAVILY ON AGRICULTURE, LOGGING MANUFACTURING/TRADE, UTILITIES, EDUCATION AND HEALTH OCCUPATIONS.

KENNEWICK, THE LARGEST OF THE \"TRI-CITIES\", SPANS APPROXIMATELY 29 SQUARE MILES AND HAS A POPULATION OF NEARLY 83,000, A 10% INCREASE SINCE 2010. THE CITY'S DIVERSE POPULATION IS 75% WHITE AND 28% HISPANIC OR LATINO ETHNICITY OF ANY RACE. THE CITY'S HISPANIC POPULATION INCREASED 125% FROM 2010 TO 2017. IN 2017, THE HOUSEHOLDS IN KENNEWICK HAD A MEDIAN ANNUAL INCOME OF $54,420, WELL BELOW THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $70979 ACROSS WASHINGTON STATE AND $61937 ACROSS THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. KENNEWICK HAS SEVERAL UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE NORMALIZATION OF SUBSTANCE USE IN THE COMMUNITY BOTH BY YOUTH AND ADULTS. FIRST, RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA WAS LEGALIZED IN WASHINGTON STATE IN 2012. SECOND, THE PRIVATIZATION OF LIQUOR SALES WAS ENACTED IN 2011, LEGALIZING THE SALE OF LIQUOR IN GROCERY STORES AND \"BIG-BOX\" STORES. FINALLY, THE AREA IS PART OF WASHINGTON'S \"WINE COUNTRY\", IS HOME TO NUMEROUS WINERIES AND BREWERIES, AND IS LOCATED ON SEVERAL WINE TOUR ROUTES. ALL OF THESE THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO A CULTURE THAT IS NOT ONLY TOLERANT TOWARDS BUT PROMOTES THE USE OF MARIJUANA AND ALCOHOL. THIS IS EVIDENT IN THE DATA WHICH SHOWS THAT A QUARTER OF KENNEWICK'S 12TH GRADERS AND NEARLY 20% OF THE 10TH GRADERS USED ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA IN 2018. EQUALLY CONCERNING IS THE 40% INCREASE IN THE USE OF E-CIGARETTES AND VAPING PRODUCTS BY KENNEWICK'S YOUTH FROM 2016 TO 2018, MIRRORING A NATIONAL INCREASE IN THE POPULARITY OF VAPING PRODUCTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. KENNEWICK YOU HAVE FOUR TIMES AS MANY DRUG-RELATED ARRESTS THAN ALL OF WASHINGTON STATE AND THREE TIMES AS MANY ALCOHOL-RELATED ARRESTS. THEY ALSO HAVE LOWER GRADUATION RATES (77%) THAN ALL OF WASHINGTON STATE (79%), BOTH OF WHICH ARE WELL BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 85%.THE KEY CONNECTION COALITION WAS FO RMED IN LATE 2018 WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF PREVENTING AND REDUCING THE USE OF ALCOHOL, MARIJUANA, TOBACCO/E-CIGARETTES, AND NON-PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS BY KENNEWICK'S YOUTH. IN ITS FIRST YEAR, KEY CONNECTION DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE LONG-RANGE PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. THIS STRATEGIC PLAN IS ROOTED IN SAMHSA'S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK PLANNING MODEL AND THE SEVEN STRATEGIES FOR COMMUNITY LEVEL CHANGE. THE COALITION RECEIVED FUNDING FROM WASHINGTON STATE'S COMMUNITY PREVENTION AND WELLNESS INITIATIVE AND IS USING THOSE FUNDS TO ADDRESS YOUTH ALCOHOL USE AND NON-PRESCRIPTION OPIOID MISUSE. IF FUNDED BY DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM, KEY CONNECTION INTENDS TO UTILIZE THE FUNDS TO REDUCE THE USE OF MARIJUANA, E-CIGARETTES/VAPE PRODUCTS, AND ALCOHOL, BY THE COMMUNITY'S YOUTH. THE SPECIFIC OUTCOMES THE COALITION HOPES TO ACHIEVE ARE TO REDUCE THE KENNEWICK'S 10TH GRADERS' USE OF MARIJUANA, E-CIGARETTES/VAPE PRODUCTS, AND ALCOHOL BY 10%, 5%, AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY. KEY CONNECTION PLANS TO IMPLEMENT MULTIPLE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, INCLUDING REDUCING YOUTH ACCESS TO THESE SUBSTANCES AND UTILIZING MEDIA, AWARENESS ACTIVITIES, AND PUBLIC EVENTS TO REDUCE THE FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TOWARDS SUBSTANCE USE AND INCREASE THE PERCEPTION OF HARM FROM SUBSTANCE USE AMONG KENNEWICK'S YOUTH.

DRUG FREE COMMUNITY COALITION - COLUMBIA COUNTY IS A GROWING, PROSPEROUS AREA THAT IS PART OF METRO-AUGUSTA, THE SECOND LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREA IN GEORGIA. IT IS LOCATED IN THE EAST CENTRAL PORTION OF GEORGIA ALONG THE SOUTH CAROLINA BORDER. IT IS CONSIDERED THE GATEWAY TO THE FORT GORDON ARMY POST, HOME OF THE U.S. ARMY CYBER CENTER OF EXCELLENCE. THE COUNTY IS MADE UP OF FIVE COMMUNITIES:  APPLING, EVANS, GROVETOWN, HARLEM AND MARTINEZ. IT HAS 290 SQUARE MILES SPLIT BY INTERSTATE 20.  OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS, THE COUNTY HAS BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY, CONCENTRATED IN THE MARTINEZ-EVANS AREA AND IN HARLEM AND GROVETOWN. AS THE COUNTY?S POPULATION HAS GROWN TO 154,291 - A 25% INCREASE IN THE PAST 10 YEARS - IT HAS EVOLVED FROM PRIMARILY RURAL TO AN INCREASINGLY URBAN BEDROOM COMMUNITY.  ABOUT 73.5% OF THE POPULATION IS WHITE, 18.4% AFRICAN AMERICAN, 6.9% HISPANIC, 4.2% ASIAN AND 3% MULTI-RACIAL AND OTHER.  APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE POPULATION SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH WITH SPANISH BY FAR THE MOST COMMON OTHER LANGUAGE. CHILDREN 18 AND YOUNGER COMPRISE 25% OF THE POPULATION WHILE 11% ARE ACTIVE AND RETIRED MILITARY FAMILIES.  COLUMBIA COUNTY IS MORE URBANIZED THAN ITS RURAL NEIGHBORS, WITH MANY SHOPPING, CULTURAL AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, MOSTLY NEAR EVANS, VOTED ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO LIVE BY MONEY MAGAZINE IN 2013. SOUTH OF I-20, THE COUNTY IS MORE RURAL AND ITS RESIDENTS ARE MUCH POORER. COLUMBIA COUNTY HAS A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY THAN ITS NEIGHBORS (16% VS 23.5% FOR THE METRO-AUGUSTA REGION); HOWEVER, IT HAS SEEN A RECENT RISE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY. THE FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH RATE HAS GROWN FROM 11% TO 33% IN THE PAST DECADE. POCKETS OF POVERTY ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY, WITH SOME SCHOOLS HAVING 60% TO 70% FRL RATES. EVEN SO, THE MEDIAN INCOME IS $20,000 HIGHER THAN GEORGIA?S. WHILE THERE ARE NO STATISTICS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE AUGUSTA REGION (INCLUDING COLUMBIA COUNTY) HAS THE SEC OND LARGEST LGBTQ POPULATION IN GEORGIA WITH ABOUT 27% HAVING CHILDREN SCHOOL-AGED OR YOUNGER. APPROXIMATELY 41% OF THE RESIDENTS CONSIDER THEMSELVES RELIGIOUS. A MAJORITY IDENTIFY WITH VARIOUS CHRISTIAN DENOMINATIONS AND 3% IDENTIFY WITH JUDAISM, ISLAM AND OTHER EASTERN RELIGIONS. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS 23,340 STUDENTS ATTENDING 18 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, EIGHT MIDDLE SCHOOLS, FIVE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ONE ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL. STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS MIRROR THOSE OF THE COUNTY. THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE IS 92%, HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE. MANY ADULTS WORK LONG HOURS OUTSIDE THE HOME AND HAVE AN AVERAGE COMMUTE TIME OF 30 MINUTES LEAVING YOUTH WITH UNSUPERVISED OUT-OF-SCHOOL TIME. THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF SUPERVISED AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAMS. MOST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE THEIR OWN CARS, MONEY AND FREE TIME TO INDULGE IN A VARIETY OF RISKY BEHAVIORS. LAKE THURMOND PROVIDES THE SITE FOR MANY TEEN PARTIES WHERE ALCOHOL IS COMMONLY USED. THERE IS EASY ACCESS TO ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS, MOSTLY FROM HOMES. JUVENILE COURT IS PACKED WITH MINOR IN POSSESSION CHARGES. FIVE YEARS AGO, RESIDENTS WERE STEEPED IN DENIAL THAT ALCOHOL, MARIJUANA AND OTHER DRUGS PRESENTED PROBLEMS IN COLUMBIA COUNTY.  THANKS TO THE FAMILY CONNECTION?S DRUG FREE COMMUNITY COALITION AND THE DFC SUPPORT PROGRAM GRANT THEY RECEIVED FROM 2015 THROUGH 2020, IMPRESSIVE INROADS IN CHANGING THOSE PERCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE.  THE FAMILY CONNECTION HAS LONG HISTORY OF BRINGING THE RIGHT FOLKS TO THE TABLE TO IDENTIFY AND TACKLE ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS, AND THEIR DFCC HAS CONTINUED THIS TRADITION IN TACKLING YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE.  NOT ONLY IS THE COMMUNITY MORE AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE, BUT THERE IS STRONG PUBLIC WILL TO SUPPORT THE DFCC?S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THEM.

WEST HAVEN SITS IMMEDIATELY ON THE I-95 INTERSTATE DRUG CORRIDOR.  WEST HAVEN IS A MID-SIZED CITY WITH AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF 55,044 (CT ECONOMIC RESOURCE CENTER [CERC], 2017).  THE CITY IS RELATIVELY LOW MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME ($55,299) SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE STATE ($73,781) AND COUNTY ($64,872). (CERC 2009)  CORRESPONDINGLY, ITS POVERTY RATE IS HIGHER: 13.2% COMPARED TO 10.1% FOR THE STATE AND 12.1% FOR THE COUNTY.  THE CITY IS RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE WITH A BREAKDOWN OF 51.8% WHITE; 22.4% BLACK; 21.0% HISPANIC; AND 3.9% ASIAN (LOCAL DATA IS DRAWN FROM UDSMAPPER.ORG).  WEST HAVEN HAS A LARGE FOREIGN BORN POPULATION OF 15.9%, COMPARED TO 13.7% FOR THE COUNTRY.  WITH REGARD TO LANGUAGE 72% OF THE POPULATION SPEAK ONLY ENGLISH, AND 28% SPEAK SOME OTHER LANGUAGE.  THE MOST PROMINENT NON ENGLISH SPEAKING LANGUAGE IS SPANISH AT 18%.  THE WEST HAVEN PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS APPROXIMATELY 6,091 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ONE HIGH SCHOOL (WITH AN ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION SCHOOL), ONE SCHOOL HOUSING 5TH AND 6TH GRADERS, ONE SCHOOL HOUSING 7TH AND 8TH GRADERS, AND SIX ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.  THE CITY ALSO HAS TWO PRIVATE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND ONE PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL.  THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS ARE THE VA MEDICAL CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAVEN AND YALE UNIVERSITY.  WHILE THERE IS NO BREAKDOWN OF RELIGIOUS DATA THAT COULD BE FOUND FOR THE CITY, THE COUNTY DATA REFLECTS THAT 51.2% REPORT NO RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION, 35.3% CATHOLIC, 11% PROTESTANT, AND 2.3% OTHER.  THE WEST HAVEN DRUG & ALCOHOL TASK FORCE WAS INCORPORATED IN 1985 THROUGH THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT'S OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE STATE.  THE COMMITTEE WAS FORMED AS A RESULT OF CONCERNS VOICED AT FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM'S PTA AROUND ISSUES OF YOUTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE.  OVER THE YEARS, THERE WAS NEVER SUFFICIENT FUNDING  TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO THE REDUCTION OF YOUTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE, NOR DID THE COALITION MAINTAIN BROAD REPRESENTATION OR RECOGNITION.  THE RECENT APPROACH HAS BEEN TO PROVIDE STRATEGIES AND EVENTS TO INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS, AND AGAIN THE LACK OF ANY PAID, DEDICATED STAFF AND FUNDING PREVENTED THE COALITION FROM CREATING A STRONG SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE ON THE VARIETY OF PLATFORMS THAT YOUTH ACCESS.  DESPITE THE LONGSTANDING PRESENCE OF THE COALITION, THE LACK OF RESOURCES DID NOT AFFORD THE OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITY LEVEL CHANGE.THE WEST HAVEN PREVENTION COUNCIL (WHPC) WILL EMPLOY ITS COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP, AND THE KEY GRANT PERSONNEL TO EFFECT COMMUNITY LEVEL CHANGE. THE MECHANISM TO ACHIEVE THIS IS THE UTILIZATION OF SAMHSA'S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK (SPF) AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEVEN STRATEGIES FOR COMMUNITY LEVEL CHANGE TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE-BASED PREVENTION STRATEGIES IN WEST HAVEN.  THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO INCREASE COMMUNITY COLLABORATION AND TO REDUCE YOUTH USE OF ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA.  THE COALITION WILL INCREASE ITS MEMBERSHIP BY 25% AND ITS LEADERSHIP BY 100%.  THE USE OF ALCOHOL WILL BE REDUCED BY ADDRESSING LOCAL ROOT CAUSES OF AVAILABILITY AND FAVORABLE ATTITUDES; THE USE OF MARIJUANA WILL BE REDUCED BY ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF LOW PERCEPTION OF HARM
