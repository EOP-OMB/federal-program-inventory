NCHC WILL IMPLEMENT ITS EXISTING ACTION PLAN AS PART OF ITS DEDICATION TO OPTIMIZING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE. THESE ARE MAJOR PRIORITIES FOR NCHC AS THEY HELP THE AGENCY ACHIEVE ITS MISSION OF ASSURING THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE HEALTH, SAFETY, AND WELL-BEING OF ALL GROUPS, INCLUDING MOTHERS (HIGH RISK OBESE WOMEN) AND THEIR CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. THE COUNTY\u2019S INFANT MORTALITY RATE FOR THE THREE YEARS 2017-2019 WAS 5.6/1,000 LIVE BIRTHS. ITS BLACK INFANT MORTALITY RATE (8.8) WAS EIGHT TIMES HIGHER THAN THE RATE NOTED FOR ITS WHITE NON-HISPANIC INFANTS (0.0, OR 18 DEATHS). BLACKS CONTRIBUTED 71% OF THE INFANT DEATHS. FURTHER, STATE DATA CONTINUES TO SHOW DISPARITIES IN IMR FOR BLACK WOMEN (8.9), WHICH IS 3.4 TIMES THE RATE REPORTED FOR THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS (2.6). (NJ STATE HEALTH ASSESSMENT DATA OR NJSHAD, 2019). OF INTEREST IS THE FACT THAT NCHC\u2019S HEALTHY START (HS) SERVED 1,364 BLACK PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE 2020-2021 GRANT PERIOD; NEARLY HALF OBESE. A TOTAL OF 157 BABIES WERE BORN. ONLY NINE INFANTS WERE LOW BIRTH WEIGHT, AND THERE WERE NO INFANT DEATHS.  NEW JERSEY IS THE 4TH WEALTHIEST STATE IN THE NATION (WORLDPOPULATIONREVIEW.COM, 2021). YET ESSEX COUNTY, IT SECOND MOST POPULOUS COUNTY, RANKS 19TH IN MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME AMONG THE STATE\u2019S 21 COUNTIES. SOME ATTRIBUTABLE FACTORS TO THE COUNTY\u2019S LOW ECONOMIC RANKING INCLUDE THE FACT THAT FOUR OF ITS MOST POPULOUS COMMUNITIES, NAMELY NEWARK, EAST ORANGE, IRVINGTON, AND ORANGE HAVE LARGE MINORITY GROUPS, AND ARE PLAGUED BY SOCIAL ILLS SUCH AS POVERTY, LOW LITERACY RATE, AND SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WITH IMPLICATIO NS FOR POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES.

STATE DATA SHOW 7.9% AND 17% FOR UNINSURED AND MEDICAID-INSURED, RESPECTIVELY (US CENSUS, 2019; MEDICAID IN NJ, 2019). THE COUNTY\u2019S URBAN AREAS ALSO REPORT A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS, STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT ENTERING COLLEGE BY OCTOBER AFTER THEY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL (49%), AND LOW FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE GRADUATION RATE; ONE IN FOUR GRADUATES WITHIN SIX YEARS (WALL, 2018).

BIRTH PLAN HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND QUALITY ACTION AREAS FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING SYSTEMS OF CARE (BY INCREASING CONNECTION TO AND COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY-BASED CARE; STRENGTHENING SOURCES OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT IN BLACK COMMUNITIES; ESTABLISHING STRONGER CARE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION; AND EXPANDING HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE) AND STRENGTHENING THE MCH WORKFORCE (BY RETAINING AND RECRUITING MORE BLACK MCH WORKERS; SUPPORTING NON-PHYSICIAN MCH WORKERS, DOULAS IN PARTICULAR; AND ESTABLISHING STANDARDS, PRACTICES, AND TRAINING THAT ENABLE MCH WORKERS TO PROVIDE MORE COMPASSIONATE AND EQUITABLE CARE).     SUSTAINING THESE STRATEGIES WIL L REQUIRE STRONG STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS. WE WILL FOCUS BOTH ON BUILDING A ROBUST PARTNERSHIP INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENGAGING IN SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES TO COORDINATE AND STREAMLINE LOCAL MCH INITIATIVES. OUR PARTNERSHIP INFRASTRUCTURE WILL INCLUDE THE MULTISECTOR BIRTH TEAM (IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING THE WORK PLAN) AND INFANT HEALTH EQUITY COALITION (THE PROJECT\u2019S GUIDING ADVISORY GROUP, WHICH WILL INCLUDE HSI-P\u2019S COMMUNITY ACTION NETWORK). WE WILL FOCUS ON BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF PARTNERS IN THREE KEY AREAS: EQUITY, POLICY ADVOCACY, AND DATA. OUR SPECIFIC COORDINATION AND STREAMLINING ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE REDUCING OVERLAP AND DUPLICATION OF MCH INITIATIVES; INCREASING EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF MCH INITIATIVES; ASSESSING AND STRENGTHENING MCH ORGANIZATIONS\u2019 AND COLLABORATIVES\u2019 EQUITY CAPACITY; AND INCREASING EQUITABLE FUNDING FOR MCH INITIATIVES IN THE REGION.   IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND ASSESS WHETHER DESIRED IMPACT IS ACHIEVED, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BIRTH PLAN WILL BE MONITORED AND ASSESSED BY AN EXTERNAL EVALUATOR. THIS COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENTAL EVALUATION WILL EMPLOY PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES TO EXPLORE WHETHER THE BIRTH PLAN IS IMPLEMENTED AS INTENDED, WHETHER THE DESIRED OUTCOMES AND IMPACT ARE ACHIEVED, AND IF AND HOW COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS CONTRIBUTED TO ACHIEVING PROGRAM OUTCOMES AND IMPACT.

FOR SEVERAL YEARS BLACK NON-HISPANIC BABIES HAVE DIED MORE THAN TWO TIMES THE RATE WHEN COMPARED TO WHITE NON-HISPANICS.  THE DIFFERENCE IN THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE GAP COULD BE EXPLAINED NOT ONLY BY VARIATIONS IN MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS, BEHAVIORS, AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, BUT ALSO BY OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING SOCIAL ISSUES AND INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES. IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMMUNITY HAS EXPERIENCED POPULATION CHANGES AND GROWTH, AS WELL AS SEVERAL ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL CHANGES THAT HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE HEALTH OF MOMS AND BABIES, INCLUDING RACIAL DISPARITIES. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE CONDITIONS NEEDED FOR HEALTH ARE PEACE, SHELTER, EDUCATION, FOOD, INCOME, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. IN SHORT, HEALTH IS CREATED WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, WORK, AND PLAY. ORANGE COUNTY, FL PLANS TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES AS PART OF A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PUBLIC INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION, EDUCATION, ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. TO ADDRESS THIS COMPLEX ISSUE THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN ORANGE COUNTY (FDOH-ORANGE) USES A DIVERSE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT APPROACH TO BRING TOGETHER THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT IMPACT INFANT MORTALITY, THROUGH ACTION AND COLLABORATION.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA ADDS TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNITY CONTEXT AND UNDERLYING SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS WHICH MAY IMPACT HIGH RATES OF INFANT MORTALITY. THE PURPOSE OF BROWARD BLACK BABIES MATTER IS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF INFANT MORTALITY, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE HIGH RATES OF BLACK TO WHITE INFANT MORTALITY IN BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA USING A COMPREHENSIVE, COORDINATED, AND INTEGRATED STRATEGIC APPROACH THAT ADDRESSES THE UPSTREAM FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DISPARITIES. AS BROWARD COUNTY HAS EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF EXCESS BLACK INFANT DEATHS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTIES WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF BIRTHS, THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE USED TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE BROWARD HEALTHY START COALITION\u2019S (BHSC) SERVICE DELIVERY PLAN 2021-2026.  THE SERVICE DELIVERY PLAN IS FOCUSED ON SEVERAL OF THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2030 OBJECTIVES RELATED TO MATERNAL, INFANT, AND CHILD HEALTH (MICH) AND FAMILY PLANNING (FP). THESE INCLUDED: 1) REDUCING CESAREAN BIRTHS AMONG LOW-RISK WOMEN WITH NO PRIOR BIRTHS; 2) DECREASING THE PROPORTION OF FETAL DEATH; 3) REDUCING PRETERM BIRTHS; 4) INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF INFANTS WHO ARE PUT TO SLEEP ON THEIR BACKS; 5) REDUCING THE RATE OF INFANT DEATH; AND 6) REDUCING PROPOR TION OF PREGNANCIES CONCEIVED WITHIN 18 MONTHS OF A PREVIOUS BIRTH. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS SPECIFIC SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING: 1) IMPROVING HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND QUALITY BY INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN WHO RECEIVE EARLY AND ADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE; 2) INCREASING SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT TO THE PRIORITY POPULATION; 3) INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF ADULTS WHO TALK TO FRIENDS OR FAMILY ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AND PARTICULARLY REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; 4) INCREASING THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH LITERACY OF THE PRIORITY POPULATION; AND 5) IMPROVING PATIENT-PROVIDER COMMUNICATION WITH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND STAFF. A COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT USING A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH WILL INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS AS WELL AS RESULTS OF FOCUS GROUPS AND KEY STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY ASSET MAPPING THAT WILL GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACTIVITIES PRIORITIZED BY COMMUNITY-INVESTED STAKEHOLDERS. FOCUS GROUPS WILL BE FACILITATED BY INDIVIDUALS WITH RECENT LIVED PREGNANCY AND BIRTHING EXPERIENCE. THE PRIORITY POPULATION FOR THIS PROJECT ARE BLACK PREGNANT AND PARENTING WOMEN LIVING IN CENSUS TRACTS WITHIN ZIP CODES 33311 AND 33313 THAT HAVE BEEN GREATLY IMPACTED BY BLACK INFANT MORTALITY. THESE CENSUS TRACTS ALSO HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES AND VOLUMES OF PRETERM BIRTHS AND LOW BIRTHWEIGHT BABIES, TWO LEADING CONTRIBUTORS TO INFANT MORTALITY. A PARTICULAR PRIORITY POPULATION WILL BE HAITIAN WOMEN LIVING IN THESE CENSUS TRACTS AS THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED HIGH RATES AND VOLUME OF BLACK INFANT MORTALITY.

THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING SDOH DOMAINS: DOMAIN 1: ECONOMIC STABILITY  DOMAIN 4: NEIGHBORHOOD AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT  DOMAIN 5: SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY CONTEXT THE PRIORITY POPULATION OF FOCUS FOR THIS ACTION PLAN IS NON-HISPANIC BLACK PREGNANT WOMEN AND INFANTS. THE JURISDICTION THAT THE ACTION PLAN FOCUSES ON IS BALTIMORE, MD, A COUNTY-LEVEL JURISDICTION SEPARATE AND APART FROM OTHER MARYLAND COUNTIES. EXISTING EVIDENCE ON HOUSING AND HEALTH CAN BE GROUPED IN FOUR PATHWAY CATEGORIES: FIRST, THERE IS RESEARCH THAT DESCRIBES THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF NOT HAVING A STABLE HOME (THE STABILITY PATHWAY). SECOND, THERE IS RESEARCH THAT DESCRIBES THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CONDITIONS INSIDE THE HOME (THE SAFETY AND QUALITY PATHWAY). A THIRD, SMALLER SET OF RESEARCH DESCRIBES THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF THE FINANCIAL BURDENS RESULTING FROM HIGH-COST HOUSING (THE AFFORDABILITY PATHWAY). FINALLY, A FOURTH RAPIDLY GROWING SET OF LITERATURE DESCRIBES THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS, I.E., THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WHERE PEOPLE LIVE (THE NEIGHBORHOOD PATHWAY). THIS PROJECT OPERATES ALO NG ALL FOUR PATHWAYS, EACH OF WHICH IS A CONDUIT FOR CUMULATIVE CHRONIC STRESS, A KNOWN MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO HEALTH DISPARITIES.  THE PROPOSED POLICY AND SYSTEMS CHANGE STRATEGIES FOCUS ON FOUR BROAD AREAS TO PROMOTE SAFE AND HEALTHY HOUSING AND COMMUNITIES: 1) EQUIPPING PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM TENANTS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND RESOURCES TO GIVE THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES IMPROVED ACCESS TO SAFE AND HEALTHY HOUSING THROUGH WORKSHOPS, INDIVIDUALIZED COUNSELING, AND EVICTION PREVENTION GRANTS; 2) ADVOCATING WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO MAKE THESE TENANT ASSISTANCE RESOURCES MORE AVAILABLE, AS WELL AS ADVOCATING FOR CHANGES IN ZONING THAT WILL FOSTER THE CREATION OF MORE QUALITY LOW-INCOME HOUSING; 3) WORKING WITH LANDLORDS AND DEVELOPERS TO PARTICIPATE IN EXISTING TENANT-ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND TO COLLABORATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE LOW-INCOME HOUSING; AND 4) WORKING WITH CITY AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY-BASED NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP MORE GREEN SPACES, INCLUDING URBAN GARDENS AND PLAYGROUNDS, IN LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS LACKING SUCH SPACES. ALL OF THESE BROAD STRATEGY AREAS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY A MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO RAISE AWARENESS OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND RECENTLY ENACTED LAWS TO PROTECT TENANT RIGHTS, AS WELL AS RAISE AWARENESS OF THE
