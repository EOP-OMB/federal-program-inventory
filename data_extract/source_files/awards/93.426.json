ACCORDING TO TN STATEWIDE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH DATA (2020; ALL RACES), HEART DISEASE REMAINS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOLLOWED BY CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE (6TH) AND HTN AND RENAL DISEASE (13TH) FOR TENNESSEANS.  AS SHOWN ON THE CDC INTERACTIVE ATLAS OF HEART DISEASE AND STROKE (2018-2020), 22 OF TN\u2019S 95 COUNTIES, HAVE THE HIGHEST TOTAL CARDIOVASCULAR BURDEN AND RELATED RISK FACTORS.
