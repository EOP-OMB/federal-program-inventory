IN ADDITION, IT IS UNKNOWN IF CURRENT EXPORT LOG MARKETS WOULD ACCEPT THIS NEW TREATMENT METHOD. THE RESEARCH TEAM PROPOSES CONDUCTING A STUDY TO IDENTIFY THE MOST FEASIBLE LOCATION FOR A VACUUM AND STEAM TREATMENT FACILITY IN VA. THIS LOCATION WILL ALSO SERVE WV, PA, MD, NC AND SC. THE TEAM WILL VISIT LOG IMPORTERS AND PHYTOSANITARY AUTHORITIES IN CHINA AND JAPAN TO CAPTURE BARRIERS AND DRIVERS OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. THESE COUNTRIES REPRESENT 86% OF THE US EXPORT LOG MARKET. THE OUTPUTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE HIGHLY BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY TO THE EXPORT LOG INDUSTRY BUT TO OTHER AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES THAT CAN BE TREATED USING STEAM AND VACUUM SUCH AS FRUITS, VEGETABLES, COTTON, RICE, STRAW, AND SEEDS.

OBJECTIVES TO ADDRESS THIS OVERALL PROJECT GOAL ARE: 1) DEVELOP MARKET PROFILES OF PTP CORE CUSTOMERS BASED ON DEMOGRAPHICS, PERCEPTIONS, AND MOTIVATIONS; 2) ESTIMATE WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY (WTP) FOR PTP IN KEY PRODUCT CATEGORIES USING EXAMPLE PRODUCTS; 3) PROVIDE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS MARKETING CHANNELS IN REACHING THE CORE CUSTOMERS, BUILDING BRAND AWARENESS, AND GENERATING VALUE FOR TENNESSEE PRODUCERS; AND 4) DISSEMINATE RESULTS BY PROVIDING OUTREACH AND EDUCATION MATERIALS TO TENNESSEE PRODUCERS ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO PARTICIPATION IN THE PTP PROGRAM AND VALUE IT COULD ADD TO THEIR PRODUCTS BASED ON CONSUMER RESEARCH. AN ONLINE CONSUMER CHOICE SURVEY WILL ASSESS TENNESSEE CONSUMERS' AWARENESS OF PTP AND WTP FOR PTP IN SEVERAL KEY PRODUCT CATEGORIES. IN ADDITION, AN EYE-TRACKING STUDY WILL EVALUATE HOW DIFFERENT PROMOTION CONTENT IMPACTS CONSUMER PREFERENCES FOR PRODUCTS IN THE PTP PROGRAM.

SUCH AN INCREASE IN SUPPLY CALLS FOR ADDITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE MARKET PLACE AND THE NEED TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIFFERENTIATED SOLAR-GRAZED LAMB PRODUCTS. THE GOAL OF THE NEW DAWN PROJECT IS THAT COOPERATIVE OR MULTI-PRODUCER OWNED ORGANIZATIONS ARE FORMED TO PROVIDE GRAZING COORDINATION, LOGISTICS, AND MARKETING SERVICES ON BEHALF OF SHEEP FARMERS. OUTCOMES TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL INCLUDE DOCUMENTATION OF NEED THROUGH ONLINE SURVEYS, FOCUS GROUPS, AND INTERVIEWS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY TEMPLATES AND A USERS' GUIDE FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS SCENARIOS. FURTHER, THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MARKET EXPANSION FOR LAMB AND SHEEP FROM SOLAR-GRAZED AND CONVENTIONAL PASTURES INCLUDING VALUE-ADDED, PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION OF SOLAR-GRAZED LAMB. A RESOURCE REPORT WILL BE CREATED AND SHARED WITH SHEEP FARMERS, INDUSTRY TRADE GROUPS, AND LAND GRANT EXTENSION EDUCATORS THROUGH REGIONAL AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS AND POSTED ONLINE. THE FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS TEMPLATES AND GUIDE WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AS A TOOL FOR FARMERS OR EDUCATORS TO PURSUE THE FORMATION OF A COOPERATIVE BUSINESS.
