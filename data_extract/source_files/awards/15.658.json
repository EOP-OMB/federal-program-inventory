THESE APPLICATIONS REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE ON HOW EDNA BEHAVES AND MOVES IN A PARTICULAR SYSTEM. HOWEVER, STUDIES COMPARING DYE TRACERS AND RELEASED DNA IN EXPERIMENTAL STREAMS INDICATE THAT THE STANDARD MODELS USED TO PREDICT CONSERVATIVE TRACERS DO NOT WORK WELL TO DESCRIBE EDNA MOVEMENT IN FLOWING SYSTEMS. UNDERSTANDING HOW EDNA CHANGES IN RIVERS WILL REQUIRE MODELS THAT INCORPORATE BIOLOGICAL, HYDROLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS. WE PROPOSE TO BUILD FROM THESE CURRENT MODELING AND MECHANISTIC STUDIES, INCORPORATING MORE COMPLEX HYDROLOGICAL FACTORS TO CREATE AND EVALUATE A MODEL OF FRESHWATER MUSSEL EDNA TRANSPORT AND DETECTION IN THE FIELD.MUSSELS ARE EXCELLENT CANDIDATES FOR STUDY BOTH BECAUSE OF THEIR CONSERVATION SIGNIFICANCE AND BECAUSE ASPECTS OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND LIFE HISTORY WILL FACILITATE MODELING AND EXPERIMENTATION. CONSERVATION INTEREST IN FRESHWATER MUSSELS IS HIGH BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF LISTED SPECIES (88 OUT OF 298 FRESHWATER MUSSEL TAXA). POPULATION MONITORING, PROPAGATION, AND REINTRODUCTION EFFORTS ARE ONGOING IN MOST MIDWESTERN AND EASTERN STATES.
