THERE IS A GROWING NEED TO ADDRESS THE INCREASING RATES OF MENTAL HEALTH (MH) CONCERNS. EXISTING EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A HIGHER REPORT OF MENTAL ILLNESS WITH AN INCREASING GAP IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS. IN 2019, THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 18-25 DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WAS 29.4%, COMPARED TO 14% IN OLDER ADULTS AGED 50 AND ABOVE. THUS, YOUNG PEOPLE MAY EXPERIENCE AGGRAVATED MH CONCERNS AND FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCESS NEEDED HEALTH SERVICES DUE TO STRUCTURAL RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION (SRD). NOTABLY, THE PREVALENCE OF MH CONCERNS HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) PANDEMIC. REDUCING THE EMOTIONAL AND MONETARY COSTS OF MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG DIVERSE RACIAL/ETHNIC YOUTHS REQUIRES COORDINATED PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES THAT EXTEND BEYOND CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS AND SHOULD INCLUDE COMMUNITY-WIDE ACTIVITIES. FURTHERMORE, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC MAY BE UNDERSTOOD AS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR, PARTICULARLY IF IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY ACTUAL OR THREATENED DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY TO THE SELF OR A LOVED ONE. WHILE THE LEVEL OF STRESS AND RESPONSE MAY DIFFER BY INDIVIDUALS, THE PATHOLOGIC PERSISTENCE OF MH SYMPTOMS CAN BE CHRONIC. THE ONSET AND EXTENT OF MH DEPEND ON COMPLEX FACTORS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF EXPOSURE, THE NATURE OF THE TRAUMA, PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND THE SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND SUPPORT NETWORKS AT THE INDIVIDUAL\u2019S DISPOSAL. CHANGES IN SPATIAL SOCIAL NETWORKS AND EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT (BLUE AND GREEN SPACES) CAN IMPACT THE MH OF INDIVIDUALS, PARTICULARLY RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY YOUTHS WHO ARE ALREADY EXPOSED TO SRD. THIS PROPOSAL SHARES THE NATIONAL VISION OF REDUCING THE BURDEN AND TREND OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ITS HEALTH DISPARITIES. PRAIRIE VIEW A&M, A PUBLIC LAND GRANT INSTITUTION ALSO DESIGNATED AS A HISTORI CAL BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY (HBCU), IS COLLABORATING WITH TWO OTHER LAND GRANT UNIVERSITIES, TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY (A HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTION) AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS, TO CARRY OUT THIS LARGE-SCALE STUDY. USING A MULTILAYER RESEARCH APPROACH (SURVEY METHODOLOGY, GIS/REMOTE SENSING, AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE EXPERIMENT), THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE INDIVIDUAL, COMMUNITY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT IMPACT RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS BY INVESTIGATING THE COMBINED IMPACT OF SPATIAL SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL ADOPT THE LIFE COURSE FRAMEWORK, WHICH EMPHASIZES HUMAN TRAJECTORIES TO UNDERSTAND PAST AND PRESENT RISKS AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS OF MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG YOUTHS AGED 18-29 IN THE US.

INDEPENDENT, SCIENCE-BASED PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATION. USP'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUBLIC HEALTH ARE ENRICHED BY THE PARTICIPATION AND OVERSIGHT OF EXPERT VOLUNTEERS REPRESENTING PHARMACY, MEDICINE, AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS AS WELL AS ACADEMIA, GOVERNMENT, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, HEALTH PLANS, AND CONSUMER ORGANIZATIONS. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (MMA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. UNDER MMA, PART D PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WITHIN EACH THERAPEUTIC CATEGORY AND CLASS OF COVERED PART D DRUGS. PER THE MMA, USP IS TASKED TO DEVELOP, IN CONSULTATION WITH PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT MANAGERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES, A LIST OF CATEGORIES AND CLASSES THAT MAY BE USED BY PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS AND TO REVISE SUCH CLASSIFICATION FROM TIME TO TIME TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THERAPEUTIC USES OF COVERED PART D DRUGS AND THE ADDITIONS OF NEW COVERED PART D DRUGS. THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE USP MEDICARE MODEL GUIDELINES REMAINS FOCUSED ON TWO OBJECTIVES: 1.\tCONDUCTING A CLINICALLY BASED REVIEW AND INCORPORATION OF PART D DRUGS (AS DEFINED IN 42 CFR 423.1001) 2.\tUPDATING THE USP CATEGORIES AND CLASSES AS NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE CHANGES IN THERAPEUTIC USES AND THE ADDITIONS OF NEW PART D DRUGS, AS SPECIFIED IN 1860D-4(B)(3)(C)(II) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT THE USP CATEGORIES AND CLASSES ARE DEVELOPED UTILIZING CONTEMPORARY SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND EXPERT EVALUATION AND AIM TO STRIKE A BALANCE OF ASSURING PART D BENEFICIARY ACCESS TO SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUGS THAT THEY NEED WITH THE FLEXIBILITY THAT PLANS NEED TO OFFER AN AFFORDABLE AND EFFECTIVE BENEFIT. THIS BALANCE CREATES THE TAXONOMY OF THE USP MEDICARE MODEL GUIDELINES, WHICH ARE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT IN PHILOSOPHY AND STRUCTURE THAN OTHER TAXONOMY SYSTEMS CLASSIFYING DRUGS SOLELY BASED UPON EITHER PHARMACOLOGY OR THERAPEUTICS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4dbf3e39-3479-f9ce-4d3e-78698dc28a7b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_1C0CMS331883_7530"}, {"internal_id": 89522367, "Award ID": "1C0CMS331728", "Award Amount": 70993.17, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-07-19", "CFDA Number": "93.779", "Description": "MEDICARE MODEL GUIDELINES VERSION 8", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4dbf3e39-3479-f9ce-4d3e-78698dc28a7b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_1C0CMS331728_7530"}, {"internal_id": 45171284, "Award ID": "1C0CMS331494", "Award Amount": 100000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2016-04-20", "CFDA Number": "93.779", "Description": "COMPLETE THE USP MEDICARE MODEL GUIDELINES V7.0 AS STIPULATED IN SECTION 1860 D-4 (B)(3)(C)(II) OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND M", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4dbf3e39-3479-f9ce-4d3e-78698dc28a7b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_1C0CMS331494_7530"}, {"internal_id": 62911187, "Award ID": "1C0CMS030269", "Award Amount": 90126.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2008-06-23", "CFDA Number": "93.779", "Description": "SUSTAINING CULTURE CHANGE IN LONG TERM CARE THROUGH TRAINING AND COLLABORATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "89a4c61c-f220-d172-ee83-880bf7786ece-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_1C0CMS030269_7530"}]
