THE US CENSUS BUREAU (2019) REPORTS THAT 15.5% OF GEORGIANS HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE. OTHER GEORGIANS HAVE INADEQUATE HEALTH COVERAGE WITH SEVERE LIMITATIONS REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT.

THE TARGET GEOGRAPHICAL AREA IS GEORGIA'S CLAYTON, DEKALB, FULTON, AND ROCKDALE COUNTIES WHOSE UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED POPULATIONS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK AND HISPANIC. ELIGIBLE ADULTS WILL LIKELY INCLUDE VETERANS, CUSTODIAL MOTHERS, DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING INDIVIDUALS (DHH), RETURNING CITIZENS, INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS, AND LGBTQIA PERSONS.

GOALS OF THE CMHC PROJECT ARE TO: 1) IMPROVE OVERALL HEALTH, WELLNESS AND RECOVERY FOR ADULTS AND YOUTH WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS BY PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL CARE SCREENING, ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT PLANNING AT PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS; 2) PROVIDE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CMHC STAFF; AND 3) TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROJECT IN ACHIEVING THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VA", "COVID-19 Obligations": 4000000.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4aec9489-1a2a-84d2-2354-11e9e974ccfc-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H79SM085634_7522"}, {"internal_id": 140657773, "Award ID": "H79SM085633", "Award Amount": 2829820.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-22", "CFDA Number": "93.958", "Description": "ALTERNATIVES TO RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT (ART) - THE CHILD CENTER RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS FUNDING FOR THE ALTERNATIVES TO RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT (ART) PROGRAM.  THE CHILD CENTER IS SEEKING A TWO-YEAR GRANT TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM WHICH WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF QUEENS YOUTH WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE (SED) AND YOUTH WITH SED AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS (CO-OCCURRING DISORDER OR COD). WE EXPECT THAT THE YOUTH WILL BE AGES 10-18 AND WILL BE REFERRED BY THE NEW YORK STATE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH (OMH) OR PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS. WE WILL SERVE 364 YOUTH PER YEAR (728 TOTAL) THROUGH THIS PROGRAM.   FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, NEW YORK CITY (AND QUEENS IN PARTICULAR, POPULATION 2,253,858) WAS THE UNDISPUTED EPI-CENTER OF THE CRISIS, IN TERMS OF CASES, DEATHS AND ECONOMIC IMPACT. COMMUNITIES THAT WERE THE HARDEST HIT WERE LOW-INCOME, PREDOMINANTLY BLACK OR LATINX, WITH CROWDED RENTAL HOUSING CONDITIONS AND WHERE NO ONE FAMILY MEMBER OVER FIVE SPEAKS ENGLISH \u201cVERY WELL.\u201d THIS POPULATION IS THE VERY ONE THE CHILD CENTER SERVES DAILY. AS OF APRIL 2021, 214,699 QUEENS RESIDENTS CONTRACTED COVID-19 - ALMOST 10% OF THE BOROUGH\u2019S POPULATION; 30,418 HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED AND 8,166 HAVE DIED. IN ADDITION, THOUSANDS OF QUEENS PARENTS HAVE LOST EMPLOYMENT DUE TO THE EPIDEMIC. ALL OF THESE FACTORS HAVE SERIOUSLY STRESSED FAMILIES AND EXACERBATED THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES OF FAMILY MEMBERS.  THE ART PROGRAM WILL HAVE THREE COMPONENTS: AN INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM (IOP), A MULTI-SYSTEMIC FAMILY THERAPY (MST) PROGRAM, AND A FUNCTIONAL FAMILY THERAPY (FFT) PROGRAM. THE GOALS ARE TO: 1) INCREASE THE RESOURCES IN NEW YORK CITY TO KEEP YOUTHS AT RISK OF RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION AT HOME; 2) ENABLE 76% (310 OF 400) OF YOUTHS WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AND CO-OCCURRING SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES AND THEIR FAMILIES TO GET A SUFFICIENT DOSE OF TREATMENT (I.E., COMPLETE THE PROGRAM.); AND 3) THE PROGRAMS WILL DEMONSTRATE FIDELITY TO THEIR MODELS AND, AS PREDICTED, PRODUCE MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN YOUTH FUNCTIONING AND ABILITY TO STAY AT HOME.  FOR THIS PROJECT, THE CHILD CENTER WILL PARTNER WITH THE NYS OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH (OMH). OMH WILL PROVIDE REFERRALS OF YOUTH WITH SED AND/OR COD, ESPECIALLY FROM AMONG FAMILIES THAT ARE SEEKING RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FOR THEIR CHILDREN. OMH WILL ALSO PROVIDE $200,000 A YEAR IN FUNDING TO PAY FOR TRAINING PROGRAM STAFF IN EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A FUNDING SOURCE WHEN THE SAMHSA GRANT PERIOD IS OVER.

WITH THE TRAUMA OF POVERTY AND CRIME, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE SUBSTANTIAL, BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO SEEK TREATMENT BECAUSE THERE IS A SEVERELY LIMITED NUMBER OF SERVICE PROVIDERS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT PRIVATE-PAY OR WHO DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT WOULD MAKE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AFFORDABLE.

THE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN A STAFF LARGE ENOUGH TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTY WITHOUT MAINTAINING WAITING LISTS IS BECOMING MORE AMPLIFIED AS COVID LOCKDOWN RESTRICTIONS LIFT.

AS PANDEMIC-RELATED RESTRICTIONS HAVE EASED IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, MHCD HAS SEEN ESCALATING DEMAND FOR ALL TYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE. FOR EXAMPLE, A PERSON CONTACTING OUR ACCESS CENTER NOW FACES AN AVERAGE TWO-AND-A-HALF MONTHS' WAIT FOR A TRADITIONAL OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL RELUCTANT TO ACCESS IN-PERSON CARE EVEN WHEN THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY URGENT.

THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS SERVICE THROUGH THEIR OWN PHONES, TABLETS OR COMPUTERS, OR THROUGH SECURE, HIPAA-COMPLIANT KIOSKS LOCATED IN DENVER SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES, SENIOR CENTERS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY SITES.  EXTENSIVE, EQUITY-BASED MARKETING AND ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WILL RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE SAME DAY SERVICE AND HOW TO USE IT.

THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE 8-COUNTY AREA, AS DOCUMENTED BY THE U.S. CENSUS 2018 AMERICAN COMMUNITY 5 YEAR SURVEY, IS 123, 149.  OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT SHOWS INDIVIDUALS IN OUR AREA CONTINUE TO FACE MANY UNMET NEEDS DUE TO THE LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED SERVICES SYSTEMS, INCONSISTENT USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES, A LACK OF INSURANCE, POVERTY (WITH 10.46% OF THE POPULATION LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY  LEVEL), AND A LACK OF AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION.  THESE CHALLENGES ARE EXACERBATED BY A PERSISTENT SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS IN THE AREA, INCLUDING PHYSICIANS AND PSYCHIATRISTS.  THE LACK OF PSYCHIATRISTS IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE AND INTENSIFIED BY A STATEWIDE DECLINE IN PSYCHIATRIC BEDS FOR EMERGENT AND CRISIS SERVICES.

A CHNA BY A LOCAL HEALTH SYSTEM ALSO IDENTIFIES A LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS/SUPPORT SERVICES AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IN NORTH CENTRAL IOWA.  THE LACK OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IS LINKED TO A CRITICALLY HIGH SUICIDE RATE WHICH, EVEN BEFORE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WAS THE NINTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN IOWA AND THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR IOWANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 10 AND 34.  SINCE 2000, SUICIDES HAVE GROWN FROM 288 TO 521 IN 2019, AND ARE GROWING STILL FURTHER DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  FROM MARCH TO AUGUST 2020 ALONE, 267 SUICIDE DEATHS WERE REPORTED IN IOWA.  CONCURRENTLY, ALCOHOL AND DRUG-RELATED HOSPITALIZATION RATES CONTINUE TO GROW.  WHILE DATA ON THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC IS STILL BEING GATHERED, THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU ESTIMATES THAT ROUGHLY 100,000 MORE IOWANS IN DECEMBER 2020 REPORTED FEELING DEPRESSED NEARLY EVERY DAY COMPARED TO WHAT WAS SURVEYED IN MAY OR OCTOBER.

CURRENTLY, THE ANCHORAGE MSA HAS A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE (FOR AN/AI PEOPLE) PROGRAMMING THAT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES ITS INCREASINGLY SEVERE SUICIDE, SUBSTANCE USE, AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES.

PROVIDE PSYCHOSOCIAL SCREENINGS, INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AND REFERRALS FOR MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER (INCLUDING SUD AND COD) TREATMENT TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE ANCHORAGE MSA. \tGOAL 3. PROVIDE TRAUMA-INFORMED AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT TRAININGS ON SUICIDE AND SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION TO YOUTH-SERVING STAFF IN THE ANCHORAGE MSA. \tGOAL 4. CONDUCT TRAUMA-INFORMED, PREVENTION-FOCUSED, AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE WELLNESS ACTIVITIES THAT STRENGTHEN POSITIVE TRIBAL CULTURAL IDENTITY AND PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION FOR AN/AI YOUTHS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE ANCHORAGE MSA. \tGOAL 5. CREATE AND IMPLEMENT AN ENDURING SOCIAL NORMS CAMPAIGN THAT PROMOTES POSITIVE BEHAVIORS AND ENCOURAGES BUILDING STRENGTHS AND DEVELOPING RESILIENCE FOR AN/AI YOUTH AUDIENCES IN THE ANCHORAGE MSA.      CITC EXPECTS THAT ITS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL HAVE NUMEROUS POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR ITS PARTICIPANTS AND FOR THE ANCHORAGE MSA\u2019S AN/AI TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN GENERAL.
