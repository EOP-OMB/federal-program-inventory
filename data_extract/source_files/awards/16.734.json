BJS AND THE FBI ARE IMPLEMENTING NCS-X WITH THE SUPPORT OF OTHER DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE OFFICE FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME. THE GOAL OF NCS-X IS TO ENROLL A SAMPLE OF 400 SCIENTIFICALLY SELECTED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO SUBMIT DATA TO NIBRS; WHEN THESE 400 NEW NIBRS-REPORTING AGENCIES ARE COMBINED WITH THE MORE THAN 6,900 AGENCIES THAT CURRENTLY REPORT TO NIBRS, THE NATION WILL HAVE A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM OF INCIDENT-BASED CRIME STATISTICS DRAWN FROM THE OPERATIONAL DATA SYSTEMS OF LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS. THESE INCIDENT-BASED DATA WILL DRAW UPON THE ATTRIBUTES AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF CRIMINAL INCIDENTS AND ALLOW FOR MORE DETAILED AND TRANSPARENT DESCRIPTIONS OF CRIME IN COMMUNITIES. THE CURRENT MECHANISM BY WHICH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT (LE) AGENCIES REPORT DATA TO THE FBI\u0092S NIBRS, IN GENERAL, IS FOR LOCAL LE AGENCIES TO SUBMIT DATA TO THEIR STATE UCR REPORTING PROGRAM, AND THEN FOR THE STATE UCR PROGRAM TO REPORT THOSE DATA TO THE FBI. WHILE THE FBI DOES ACCEPT NIBRS DATA DIRECTLY FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, THE HIGHLY PREFERRED ROUTE OF REPORTING IS THROUGH THE STATE UCR PROGRAM. THE FY2019 SOLICITATION FURTHERS THE GOALS OF THE NCS-X INITIATIVE BY PROVIDING FUNDING TO THE REMAINING STATES AND LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE NCS-X SAMPLE IN ORDER TO ASSIST THEM TRANSITION TO NIBRS REPORTING. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT INCLUDES RMS TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT.

RTI IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING COGNITIVE INTERVIEWS TO REFINE BOTH SETS OF QUESTIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PROPOSED LEMAS SUPPLEMENT, WHICH WILL BE FIELDED IN FALL 2023.\n\nTO ACHIEVE THE BJS\u2019S GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, RTI PROPOSES TO ORGANIZE THE 2023 LEMAS SUPPLEMENT WORK ACROSS FIVE TASKS: (1) PROJECT MANAGEMENT, (2) FRAME DEVELOPMENT AND SAMPLE SELECTION, (3) INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT, (4) DATA COLLECTION, AND (5) DATA PROCESSING AND DELIVERY. OUTCOMES FROM THE 2023 LEMAS SUPPLEMENT WILL INCLUDE DATASETS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND AN UPDATED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ROSTER FILE.\u00a0\u00a0THROUGH OUR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2016 AND 2020 LEMAS-CORE SURVEYS, OUR WORK WITH BJS TO DEVELOP THE LEMAS SUPPLEMENT QUESTIONS, AND OUR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE LECS PROGRAM, THE RTI TEAM IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO CONDUCT THIS DATA COLLECTION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8303ed9b-9fb4-3e90-ca81-50bbcf400948-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJS22GK00267MUMU_1550"}, {"internal_id": 156905659, "Award ID": "15PBJS21GK02811RESS", "Award Amount": 499056.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-11-04", "CFDA Number": "16.734", "Description": "STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: RESEARCH AND REPORTING ON THE LOCAL JAIL SYSTEM IS INHIBITED BY SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS RELATED TO DISPERSED RECORD MANAGEMENT SPREAD ACROSS MORE THAN 3,200 FACILITIES. THE MAJORITY OF CURRENT DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS FOCUS ON SUPPORT OF AGGREGATE STATISTICAL REPORTING WHICH SEVERELY NARROWS THE UTILITY OF THE DATA FOR OTHER STATISTICAL PURPOSES. COLLECTING PERSON-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS FROM THE LOCAL JAIL SYSTEM WILL ADVANCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH STATISTICAL REPORTING AND RESEARCH. SUBJECTS: INFORMATION WILL BE COLLECTED FROM JAIL PERSONNEL ABOUT THEIR DATA MANAGEMENTS SYSTEMS AS WELL AS PERSON-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS ON LOCAL JAIL POPULATIONS. DATA COLLECTED FROM JAIL PERSONNEL WILL INCLUDE THE 30 LARGEST JAILS IN THE UNITED STATES. PERSON-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE DATA WILL BE COLLECTED FROM 10 OF THE 30 LARGEST JAILS. PARTNERSHIPS: THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS SYSTEM (CJARS) IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU. DATA COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND HARMONIZATION FOR THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE TAKES PLACE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IS RESPONDING TO THIS SOLICITATION INDEPENDENTLY OF THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: DATA COLLECTED FOR THIS PROJECT WILL INVOLVE BOTH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH JAIL PERSONNEL AND EXTRACTION OF PERSON-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE JAIL RECORDS. THE RAW PERSON-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS WILL BE PROCESSED AND HARMONIZED TO GENERATE ANALYTICAL FILES THAT WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING FILES: ADMISSIONS/RELEASE INFORMATION, CHARGE CATEGORIES, AND THE JAIL POPULATION AT MIDYEAR AND END OF YEAR. DATA PROCESSING AND HARMONIZATION WILL LEVERAGE THE CJARS DATA INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE INNOVATIVE DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES THAT IT HAS DEVELOPED. ANALYSIS: EXTENSIVE DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON ANALYTICAL FILES TO ENSURE DATA QUALITY. DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENTS WILL INCLUDE THE EVALUATION OF MISSING DATA, INVALID DATA ENTRIES, IMPROBABLE/IMPOSSIBLE DATES, ILLOGICAL SEQUENCES OF EVENTS, AND OUTLIERS. OUR DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENTS WILL ALSO BENCHMARK THE ANALYTIC FILES AGAINST THE DATA RECEIVED FROM JAILS TO OTHER PUBLISHED JAIL STATISTICS. WE WILL CONDUCT BENCHMARKING EXERCISES TO COMPARE SEVERAL METRICS INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF INMATES, CHARGES, DISPOSITIONS, DETENTION STATUS, MIDYEAR AND AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION COUNTS, ANNUAL ADMISSIONS COUNTS, INCARCERATION RATES, AND AVERAGE TIME SPENT IN JAIL. PRODUCTS AND REPORTS: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND REPORTS THAT WILL BE PRODUCED AS PART OF THIS PROJECT. THESE WILL INCLUDE A DATA SPECIFICATIONS REPORT, A REPORT SUMMARIZING FINDINGS FROM INTERVIEWS WITH JAIL PERSONNEL, RAW DATA FILES AND DOCUMENTATION, ANALYTICAL DATA FILES, DATA ASSESSMENT REPORTS, AND FINAL DATA DOCUMENTATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1567efcf-bcdb-61b9-72f2-70cbed5fa626-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJS21GK02811RESS_1550"}, {"internal_id": 146120851, "Award ID": "15PBJS21GK02597RESS", "Award Amount": 2099941.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-10-18", "CFDA Number": "16.734", "Description": "FY 2021 NATIONAL CENSUS OF VICTIM SERVICE PROVIDERS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "51ca939d-6784-3f34-4b83-3f5e2e4699ba-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_15PBJS21GK02597RESS_1550"}, {"internal_id": 156905654, "Award ID": "15PBJS21GK00005BJSB", "Award Amount": 745317.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-22", "CFDA Number": "16.734", "Description": "THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS (BJS) COLLECTS INFORMATION REGARDING THE NUMBER, TYPES, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING ACADEMIES (LETAS) THROUGH ITS CENSUS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING ACADEMIES (CLETA) DATA COLLECTION SERIES.

OFFICER TRAINING HAS PLAYED A ROLE IN THESE EFFORTS, AND DISCUSSIONS INCLUDE WHICH TRAINING TOPICS ARE MOST CRITICAL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT REFORM, WHICH TYPES OF OFFICER TRAINING ARE MOST EFFECTIVE, AND HOW MUCH OFFICER TRAINING IS NEEDED.
