ADDITIONALLY, NEW MEXICO WAS RECENTLY LISTED AS THE WORST STATE IN THE COUNTRY FOR CHILD WELLBEING BY THE 2022 KIDS COUNT DATA BOOK [2]. THE PEOPLE OF THE TAOS PUEBLO, LIKE MANY NATIVE AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE US, HAVE BEEN FACING AN EPIDEMIC OF DIABETES-RELATED ILLNESS.  IN 2021, THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES WAS 13.3% AMONG IHS\u2019S PATIENT CRITERIA FOR REPORTING STATISTICS. MOREOVER, WHEN LOOKING AT RISK FACTORS FOR DIABETES IN THE USER POPULATION, 80% HAD A BMI >25, A1C &LT;8.0 WAS 30%, AND THE NUMBER OF DIABETES RELATED CONDITIONS IS 31%. THE NUMBERS IN THE USER POPULATION SHOW THAT THERE IS AN EPIDEMIC OF RISK FACTORS FUELING DIABETES ON THE PUEBLO. THE TAOS PUEBLO DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM WAS FOUNDED IN 1998 UNDER THE 2ND ITERATION OF SDPI FUNDING. THE PROGRAM\u2019S INITIAL FOCUS, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE TAOS PUEBLO TRIBAL GOVERNMENT AND WITH THE CLINICAL SUGGESTION OF THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE/TAOS PICURIS SERVICE UNIT, WAS PRIMARY PREVENTION FOR YOUTH. INCREASING ACCESS TO PHYSICAL FITNESS PROGRAMMING FOR YOUTH WAS A PRIORITY FOR THE COMMUNITY.  TAOS PUEBLO COMPACTED SERVICES THROUGH THE TITLE 1 AND TITLE 5 SELF-GOVERNANCE MODEL IN 2006-2009, WHICH ENCOURAGED PROGRAMS TO WORK MORE COLLABORATIVELY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. THIS INCREASED THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE SDPI AND CHR PROGRAMS, PROVIDING AN EVEN WIDER SCOPE OF SERVICES. CHRS HAD MORE ACCESS TO DIABETES TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND SUPPLIES AND WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE SERVICES IN ONE-ON-ONE AND HOME SETTINGS FOR ELDERS.

OUR REQUIRED KEY MEASURE (RKM) FOR THE FY23 PROGRAM IS DIABETES-RELATED EDUCATION. WE CHOSE THIS BEST PRACTICE BECAUSE THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND RISK FACTORS FOR DIABETES ARE HIGH ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF AGES. DIABETES-RELATED EDUCATION ALLOWS THE PROGRAM THE GREATEST FLEXIBILITY IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF VARYING AGE RANGES. WE CAN CONSISTENTLY SUPPORT THOSE AT THE INFLECTION POINT BETWEEN WELLNESS AND DISEASE BY TARGETING THOSE AT RISK FOR DIABETES WITH MULTIPLE INTERVENTION STYLES, FROM SIGNAGE TO TEXT MESSAGES, TO COOKING DEMOS, TO PHYSICAL FITNESS PROGRAMS.

FOR THIS REASON, THE CPN SDPI TEAM HAS CHOSEN DEPRESSION SCREENING AS THE BEST PRACTICE FOR FY2023. DEPRESSION SCREENING FORMS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO ALL DIABETES PROGRAM APPOINTMENTS. IN ADDITION, INFORMATION RELATING TO DEPRESSION WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ALL CITIZEN POTAWATOMI NATION HEALTH SERVICES (CPNHS) LOCATIONS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPRESSION SCREENINGS AND RESOURCES FOR SUPPORT. PATIENTS WITHOUT A RECENT DEPRESSION SCREENING IN THEIR CHART WILL RECEIVE EDUCATION AND REMINDERS TO COMPLETE ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  IN ADDITION TO OUR SELECTED BEST PRACTICE, DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION AND SUPPORT (DSMES) PROGRAM BUILDING EDUCATION ABOUT DIABETES (BEAD) WILL BE OFFERED TO BOTH NEWLY AND PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. PATIENTS COMMONLY PRESENT WITH COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS RETINOPATHY, NEUROPATHY, ULCERS, OBESITY, AND KIDNEY PROBLEMS IN ADDITION TO DISEASE DENIAL, DEPRESSION, AND MISINFORMATION THAT LEADS TO POOR DISEASE MANAGEMENT. THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE EDUCATION ON ALL AREAS OF DIABETES MANAGEMENT AND EQUIPS PARTICIPANTS WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO BETTER MANAGE THEIR DIABETES, PREVENT LONG TERM COMPLICATIONS, AND SUPPORT PATIENTS IN THEIR JOURNEY WITH THIS CHRONIC ILLNESS. A REGISTERED DIETITIAN WILL CONDUCT A MINIMUM OF TWELVE COOKING DEMONSTRATIONS WITH NUTRITION EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. EDUCATION WILL INCLUDE FOOD PREPARATION, FOOD SAFETY, NUTRITION RECOMMENDATIONS, GUIDELINES, AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION EDUCATION.  DIABETIC FOOT EXAMS WILL BE PERFORMED BY A CERTIFIED FOOD CARE NURSE (CFCN). THE CFCN WILL CHECK FEET FOR CHANGES IN BLOOD FLOW, SIGNS OF NERVE DAMAGE, INGROWN NAILS, SKIN PROBLEMS, AND SORES. ADDITIONAL TESTING WILL BE DONE TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF LOW SENSATION. ALL PATIENTS ON THE CPN IHS DIABETES REGISTRY WITH A DIAGNOSIS WITH TYPE 1 OR TYPE 2 DIABETES MAKE UP THE TARGET GROUP FOR THIS ACTIVITY.

FURTHERMORE, THE TEAM WILL PLACE A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON INCREASING RATES OF FOOT EXAMS IN THE CN COMMUNITY, AS THIS WAS CHOSEN TO BE THE DESIGNATED BEST PRACTICE. THE IHS AUDITS REVEALED, SPECIFICALLY, THAT THERE WERE DECREASED RATES OF COMPLETED DENTAL EXAMS AND ONLY MINOR IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH INFLUENZA VACCINATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE FOOT EXAM RATES IN 2021 AND 2022. THE CN DCC HAS DECIDED THAT THE BEST OPTION TO ADDRESS BOTH EXAM AND VACCINATION RATES WILL BE TO EDUCATE PATIENTS AT EACH VISIT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ANNUAL EXAMS AND VACCINATIONS TO PREVENT COMPLICATIONS, IDENTIFY ISSUES AT THE EARLIEST STAGES BEFORE ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS ARISE AND PROTECT OVERALL HEALTH. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROGRAM WILL BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT A DETAILED INTERNAL SCREENING AND HISTORY FORM AND WILL USE ALL VISITS AS OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS DUE FOR EXAMS, PLACE CONSULTS FOR EXAMS DUE AND DOCUMENT ACCORDINGLY. THE GOAL IS THAT BY IMPLEMENTING MORE THOROUGH MEASURES TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS DUE FOR DENTAL AND FOOT EXAMS, AS WELL AS INFLUENZA VACCINATIONS, THE COMPLETION RATES FOR THESE SERVICES WILL IMPROVE. MOREOVER, IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS BEING LIFTED IN THE CN COMMUNITY, THE RESULTING INCREASED NUMBER OF IN-PERSON PATIENT VISITS WILL CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS DUE FOR A DENTAL EXAM, COMPREHENSIVE FOOT EXAM AND/OR INFLUENZA VACCINATION. CLINICAL CARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE COLLECTED FROM DATA FROM THE GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS ACT (GPRA) MEASURES TO ASSESS PATIENT POPULATION NEEDS. A PATIENT POPULATION OF 2,500 AMERICAN INDIAN (AI) DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) WAS IDENTIFIED AND ASSESSED TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE UP TO DATE ON THEIR INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATIONS AND DENTAL AND FOOT EXAMS. OF PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED A SCREENING AT CNMC, DATA INDICATED THE RATE MET FOR COMPLETED DM FOOT EXAMS AS 54.5 PERCENT, DM INFLUENZA VACCINATION AS 72.1 PERCENT AND DM DENTAL EXAMS AS 32.5 PERCENT. IT WAS DECIDED BY THE CN DCC TEAM TO PLACE THE MOST FOCUS ON FOOT EXAMS AND USE THEM AS THEIR BEST PRACTICE, WITH THE PROGRAM GOAL OF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPREHENSIVE FOOT EXAMS COMPLETED. THIS PROJECT SEEMED MOST PERTINENT GIVEN THAT PEOPLE WITH DIABETES ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR VASCULAR AND NERVE DAMAGE THAT MAY COMPROMISE BLOOD FLOW AND REDUCE SENSATION IN THE FEET. PAIN SENSATION PROVIDES PROTECTION AND EARLY INDICATION OF WOUNDS AND OTHER ISSUES; WITHOUT THAT PROTECTION, FOOT ULCERS, INFECTIONS AND AMPUTATIONS MAY RESULT, WHICH CAN AFFECT MOBILITY AND OVERALL QUALITY OF HEALTH. THE AIM WILL BE TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING PATIENTS DUE FOR COMPREHENSIVE FOOT EXAMS, DOCUMENT CONSULTATIONS FOR EXAMS AND INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES TO EDUCATE PATIENTS.

THE MUSEUM OF THE CHEROKEE INDIANS LINKS CHEROKEE ANCESTRY BACK AS MANY AS 10,000 YEARS.  THE EASTERN BAND OF THE CHEROKEE (EBCI) MEMBERS ARE DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF THE CHEROKEE NATION AND THE OCONALUFTEE CHEROKEE OF 1817 AND 1819.  THE OCONALUFTEE CHEROKEE INCLUDE THOSE WHO AVOIDED THE CHEROKEES' FORCED REMOVAL TO OKLAHOMA IN THE 1830'S \"TRAIL OF TEARS\u201d, AS WELL AS, THOSE THAT RETURNED AFTER THE REMOVAL. EBCI WAS DULY INCORPORATED IN 1889 UNDER A CORPORATE CHARTER AND THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF EBCI\u2019S RECOGNITION AS A SOVEREIGN NATION.  ENROLLMENT TODAY IS APPROXIMATELY 16,000 ENROLLED MEMBERS AND AT THIS TIME EBCI IS THE ONLY FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE IN NORTH CAROLINA.  APPROXIMATELY 12,000 AI/ANS ARE CONSIDERED ACTIVE USERS OF THE TRIBAL HEALTH SYSTEM REFERRED TO AS THE CHEROKEE INDIAN HOSPITAL AUTHORITY.  WITH THE ENCROACHMENT OF WHITE SETTLERS IN 1500, AND MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES NOT OF THE CHEROKEE\u2019S CHOOSING, THE PEOPLE HAD TO CHANGE THEIR WAY OF LIFE.  20,000 MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE WALKED THE TRAIL OF TEARS TO OKLAHOMA.  OF THOSE LEFT BEHIND, SOME WERE PLACED IN BOARDING SCHOOLS AND NO LONGER HAD THEIR TRADITIONAL FOODS AVAILABLE.  THEY WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR IDENTITY AND MADE TO BE MORE LIKE THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS.  OTHERS WERE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES IN AN EVER CHANGING ENVIRONMENT.  OVER TIME AND PRESSURES FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD, THE CHEROKEE ADAPTED INTO A MODERN WAY OF LIFE.  THIS HAS BROUGHT ON A CHANGE IN THE PEOPLE THAT HAS LEFT THE TRADITIONAL WAYS IN THE BACKGROUND.  TODAY, THE CHEROKEE ENJOY ALL THE CONVENIENCES OF THE MODERN WAY OF LIFE.  THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO HUNT FOR THEIR MEAT OR PLANT AND TEND GARDENS FOR THEIR PRODUCE.  THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO PHYSICALLY WORK FOR THEIR FOOD AND WAY OF LIFE.  THIS FACT AND HISTORICAL STRESSORS HAVE BROUGHT CHANGES TO THE GENERAL HEALTH OF THE TRIBE.  CHEROKEE MEN AND WOMEN ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE OBESE AS MEMBERS OF OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS IN NORTH CAROLINA.  THE PREVALENCE RATE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG CHEROKEE MEN AND WOMEN COMBINED IS 20%. THIS RATE IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE COMBINED RATE FOR MEN AND WOMEN FROM ALL OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS IN NORTH CAROLINA.  THE CHEROKEE DIABETES PROGRAM WORKS TO EASE THE BURDEN OF DIABETES ON THE TRIBE AND ITS MEMBERS.

SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE CSU INCLUDE MEDICAL, DENTAL, LABORATORY, NUTRITION, DIABETES CARE AND EDUCATION, PODIATRY, OPTOMETRY, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND PHARMACY. BY BEING HOUSED WITHIN THE CSU, THE CSU SDPI IS ABLE TO PROVIDE A MYRIAD OF CLINICAL ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES GEARED TOWARD DIABETES PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT. THE CSU EMPLOYS ABOUT 30 STAFF, MANY OF WHOM SERVE AS KEY PERSONNEL ON THE CSU SDPI TEAM.  THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF TRIBAL MEMBERS TO THE CSU ALLOWS FOR GREATER ACCESS TO CLINIC SERVICES AND COMMUNITY EVENTS. THERE ARE OVER 3,000 CITIZENS OF THE CATAWBA INDIAN NATION, OF WHICH ABOUT 680 LIVE ON THE RESERVATION. APPROXIMATELY 75 PERCENT OF TRIBAL MEMBERS LIVE WITHIN TWO HOURS OF THE RESERVATION. THE CSU IS LOCATED ON THE RESERVATION AND IS NEAR ALL TRIBAL PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS, MAKING PARTNERSHIPS EASY TO FORM AND SUSTAIN.  ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT DIABETES-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY CSU STAFF, TRIBAL LEADERSHIP, AND THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE/HEART DISEASE. GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS ACT DATA FROM JULY 2022 SHOW THAT ONLY 45.9% OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES AT THE CSU HAVE BLOOD PRESSURES <140/<90 MMHG. ALTHOUGH BLOOD PRESSURE GOALS SHOULD BE INDIVIDUALIZED, HAVING A BLOOD PRESSURE <140/<90 MMHG CAN REDUCE THE RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS, SUCH AS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND, THEREFORE, THE AIM IS TO HAVE A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES WHO HAVE BLOOD PRESSURES <140/<90 MMHG. OTHER ITEMS PINPOINTED IN A RECENT COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY TO BE KEY-DIABETES RELATED HEALTH CONCERNS INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH, OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY, TOBACCO USE, DIABETES PREVALENCE, AND ORAL HEALTH CARE.  THE CSU SDPI HAS SELECTED BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL AS ITS BEST PRACTICE FOR 2023. ALTHOUGH BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL WAS SELECTED AS THE BEST PRACTICE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE CSU SDPI FEELS THAT ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES RELATED TO THIS BEST PRACTICE WILL TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO TRULY MAKE A LARGE IMPACT. AMONGST THOSE WHO HAVE DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE RISK OF HEART DISEASE. HEART DISEASE, IN TURN, IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH FOR AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKA NATIVES. BECAUSE BLOOD PRESSURE MANAGEMENT IS SUCH A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF DIABETES CARE, THE CSU SDPI WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON THIS BEST PRACTICE TO IMPROVE THE RATE OF BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL EVEN FURTHER.  THE TARGET GROUP, WHICH TOTALS 191 INDIVIDUALS, FOR THE SELECTED BEST PRACTICE INCLUDES ACTIVE ADULT PATIENTS WITH TYPE 1 OR TYPE 2 DIABETES WHO ARE SEEN AT THE CSU AT LEAST ONCE YEARLY. THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE NUMBER AND PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE TARGET GROUP WHO HAVE A MEAN BLOOD PRESSURE <140/<90 MMHG.

NSDP, A NAVAJO NATION GOVERNMENT OPERATED AGENCY WITHIN THE NAVAJO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, WAS ESTABLISHED IN JUNE 1999 TO PROMOTE HEALTHY LIFE-STYLES AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO REDUCE AND PREVENT DIABETES AFFECTING THE NAVAJO PEOPLE.  NSDP\u2019S VISION IS TO PROMOTE A LIFE FILLED WITH BEAUTY, HARMONY AND HAPPINESS THROUGH DIABETES PREVENTION, EDUCATION AND WELLNESS.  ACCORDING TO U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF MINORITY HEALTH DIABETES MELLITUS, 23.5% OF AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE (AI/AN) ADULTS AREA DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES.  MOREOVER, AI/AN ADULTS ARE ALMOST THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN NON-HISPANIC WHITE ADULTS TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES, 2.3 TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN NON-HISPANIC WHITES TO DIE FROM DIABETES, AND TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH END STAGE RENAL DISEASE THAN NON-HISPANIC WHITES.  WHEN COMPARED TO THE NAVAJO NATION, THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DIABETES (24,092 INDIVIDUALS) ON THE NAVAJO NATION IN 2021 IS CONSISTENT WITH ESTIMATES ABOVE. PRIOR TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC, PREVALENCE OF DIABETES INCREASED 13% FROM 2016-2020 PER NAVAJO AREA INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE AUDIT; HOWEVER, CURRENT DATA THROUGH THE  PANDEMIC INDICATES A DECREASE IN PREVALENCE FROM PRIOR YEARS.  WHILE THE ONSET OF DIABETES ACROSS THE U.S. HAS INCREASED SINCE THE PANDEMIC, THE NSDP IS CONCERNED THAT DIABETES HAS INCREASED ON THE NAVAJO NATION. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) STATES, AI/AN ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19 DUE TO UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES, OBESITY, AND HEART DISEASE. IN ADDITION, THE NAVAJO EPIDEMIOLOGY CENTER (NEC) ALSO INDICATES HIGH RATES OF COVID-19 TRANSMISSION ON THE NAVAJO NATION.

BAY MILLS HEALTH CENTER, THE HOME BASE FOR THE DIABETES PROGRAM, WAS DEDICATED AS THE ELLEN MARSHALL MEMORIAL CENTER IN 1998.  ELLEN MARSHALL WAS A TRADITIONAL HEALER AND MIDWIFE AT THE TURN OF THE 20TH CENTURY.  SHE SERVED NOT ONLY THE BAY MILLS TRIBE, BUT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AS WELL.  THE HEALTH CENTER HAS CONTINUED TO HONOR THIS SAME TRADITION BY PROVIDING SERVICES TO ANY COUNTY RESIDENT WISHING TO ESTABLISH CARE.  BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY IS IN A RURAL, MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA.  DESPITE THIS, THE TRIBE\u2019S HEALTH CENTER PROVIDES MANY BASIC MEDICAL SERVICES, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT SINCE THE NEAREST LOCATION WITH SIMILAR SERVICES IS AT LEAST 20 MILES EAST IN SAULT SAINTE MARIE, A TOWN OF ABOUT 13,000 RESIDENTS.  TO MEET THE EVER-EXPANDING NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, BAY MILLS HEALTH CENTER MOVED INTO A NEW FACILITY IN APRIL 2022.  THE NEW BUILDING OFFERS PRIMARY CARE SERVICES WITH A FULL-TIME STAFF OF ONE PHYSICIAN AND THREE CERTIFIED FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONERS.  A TRADITIONAL HEALER NOW HOLDS PART-TIME HOURS IN THE MEDICAL CLINIC AS WELL.  DENTAL, PHARMACY, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND SOCIAL SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE.  OPTOMETRY IS A MUCH NEEDED AND NEWLY ADDED SERVICE.  A COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT FULFILLS A VARIETY OF NEEDS, INCLUDING DIABETES EDUCATION AND SUPPORT, COMMUNITY AND EMPLOYEE VACCINATIONS, HEALTHY START AND TRIBAL HOME VISITING, MANAGEMENT OF THE BAY MILLS FARMER\u2019S MARKET, AND PATIENT TRANSPORTATION.  BAY MILLS HAS RECEIVED FUNDING FROM SDPI SINCE 1998.  IT HAS BENEFITED THE COMMUNITY IN MANY WAYS.  IT HAS GIVEN THE HEALTH CENTER THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO HIRE QUALIFIED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS (I.E., REGISTERED NURSE AND REGISTERED DIETITIAN) TO EDUCATE AND SUPPORT TRIBAL MEMBERS IN DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT CARE (SEE BEST PRACTICE OF DIABETES-RELATED EDUCATION IN PART D OF THE PROJECT NARRATIVE).  SDPI DOLLARS HAVE ALSO PAID FOR CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION SO THAT THESE PROFESSIONALS CAN KEEP CURRENT WITH THE LATEST ADVANCES IN THIS FIELD.  FUNDING IN 2023 WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED TO SUPPORT SDPI KEY PERSONNEL POSITIONS AND ALSO FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION.  ANOTHER SERVICE THE BAY MILLS SDPI PROGRAM HAS CONTRIBUTED STAFF TIME TO IS COMMUNITY VACCINATION CLINICS TO PREVENT ILLNESSES SUCH AS INFLUENZA AND COVID-19, WHICH MAY CAUSE MORE SEVERE COMPLICATIONS IN PEOPLE WITH DIABETES.  IN THE PAST, SDPI KEY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ACHIEVING AN 83% FLU VACCINATION RATE ON THE 2021 ANNUAL DIABETES AUDIT REPORT.  THIS WAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE IN THE PREVIOUS 14 YEARS OF AUDIT DATA FOR BAY MILLS.  THIS WORK WILL CONTINUE IN 2023 (SEE ACTIVITY/SERVICE #1 REGARDING FLU IMMUNIZATIONS IN PART E OF THE PROJECT NARRATIVE) WITH THE ADDITION OF THE PNEUMOVAX VACCINE TO COMMUNITY FLU CLINICS TO IMPROVE DATA FOR THE ANNUAL DIABETES AUDIT REPORT (SEE PROJECT NARRATIVE PART B).  SDPI FUNDING HAS ALSO BEEN USED TO PURCHASE A NUMBER OF TYPES OF PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT DIABETES CARE.  ONE TYPE OF PRODUCT IS GLUCOSE TESTING SUPPLIES FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS SINCE THE HEALTH CENTER\u2019S PHARMACY DOES NOT HAVE A DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT LICENSE TO BILL INSURANCE FOR THEM AND THE 20-MILE DISTANCE BETWEEN BAY MILLS AND THE NEAREST PHARMACY ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE PRESENTS A CHALLENGE FOR SOME PEOPLE.  SUPPLIES FOR FOOT CARE RELATED TO BEST PRACTICE ACTIVITY # 3 (SEE PROJECT NARRATIVE PART D) AND FARMER\u2019S MARKET COUPONS FOR BAY MILLS MEMBERS ACTIVE WITH THEIR DIABETES CARE AT THE HEALTH CENTER ARE AMONG OTHER ITEMS SDPI FUNDING HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED FOR IN 2023.

OBESITY IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH TYPE 2 DIABETES AND PREDIABETES. INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT OR DELAY THE DEVELOPMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES HAVE THE POTENTIAL BOTH TO IMPROVE INDIVIDUAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH DISEASE AVOIDANCE (E.G., EYE, KIDNEY, AND NERVE DAMAGE; STROKES; HEART ATTACKS) AND TO SAVE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SUBSTANTIAL MEDICAL COSTS BY REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND ITS ASSOCIATED COMPLICATIONS.

ROUND VALLEY INDIAN HEALTH CENTER IS LOCATED IN AN UNDER-SERVED AREA DESIGNATED AS A RURAL FRONTIER LOCATION IN COVELO, A REMOTE VALLEY COMMUNITY IN NORTHERN MENDOCINO COUNTY, OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS 25 MILES EAST OF HIGHWAY 101 AND AN ADDITIONAL 15 MILES FROM THE NEAREST HOSPITAL AND EMERGENCY SERVICES IN WILLITS, CALIFORNIA. THE ROUND VALLEY INDIAN HEALTH CENTER PROVIDES PRIMARY HEALTH, DENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE TO APPROXIMATELY 3,000 PEOPLE LIVING IN COVELO AND THE ADJACENT ROUND VALLEY INDIAN RESERVATION. THERE ARE NO OTHER MEDICAL OR DENTAL SERVICES WITHIN A ONE HOUR RADIUS OF THE RESERVATION OR THE TOWN OF COVELO. ALL SPECIALTY HEALTH SERVICES ARE AT LEAST A THREE TO EIGHT HOUR ROUND TRIP DISTANCE AWAY. THE RESERVATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1856 AND IS THE ANCESTRAL HOMELAND OF THE YUKI NATION AND HOME TO SIX OTHER INDIAN TRIBES. THE HEALTH CENTER STAFF IS DEDICATED NOT ONLY TO TREATMENT, PREVENTION, AND PATIENT EDUCATION, BUT ALSO RECOGNIZES TRADITIONAL INDIAN MEDICINE AND HOLISTIC HEALING. UNIQUE CHALLENGES IN PREVENTING AND TREATING DIABETES IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE FREQUENTLY DUE TO OUR REMOTE LOCATION AND LACK OF RESOURCES RELATED TO THE LOCATION. IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT 45% OF THE COMMUNITY LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. THIS POVERTY LEVEL AFFECTS THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE QUALITY FOOD AND HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN COVELO AND THE LONG DRIVE TO THE NEAREST TOWN, IT IS DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN APPROPRIATELY TRAINED PROFESSIONAL STAFF, AND FOR PATIENTS TO RECEIVE NEEDED CARE.

IN 2009 PER COMMUNITY REQUEST, THE YNDP OPENED DOORS TO A NEW FACILITY WITH ACCESS TO AN EXERCISE FACILITY AND FOCUSED THE MAJORITY OF SERVICES TOWARD PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF DIABETES IN THE COMMUNITY. DUE TO THE CONTINUING BURDEN OF DIABETES ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, THE YAKAMA INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE SDPI CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK REDUCTION HEALTHY HEART DEMONSTRATION PROJECT AND IMPLEMENTED THE YAKAMA HEALTHY HEART PROGRAM (YHHP) IN 2004. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO DECREASE THE DISEASE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN THE AI/AN DIABETIC POPULATION.  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM UTILIZED PHARMACISTS AS CLINICAL CASE MANAGERS UNDER COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENTS TO REMEDY A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE FAMILY PRACTICE MEDICAL PROVIDERS AVAILABLE TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE, EDUCATION IN DIABETES TREATMENT AND PREVENTION, AND IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES.  THE YHHP RESULTED IN IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN ALL CATEGORIES ON THE DIABETES AUDIT. THE YHHP RECEIVED ACCREDITATION IN 2011 FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN DIABETES EDUCATORS AND BECAME A CDC RECOGNIZED DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM IN 2018.  CURRENTLY, OVER HALF OF THE PATIENTS WITH DIABETES HAVE CONSENTED TO RECEIVE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR DIABETIC CARE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. THE YHHP HAS BEEN A LEADER WITHIN THE SDPI COMMUNITY AND INDIAN COUNTRY THROUGH DISSEMINATION OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND PRESENTATION OF CLINICAL OUTCOMES UTILIZING PHARMACISTS AS CLINICAL PROVIDERS. WITH THE FY 2016 CHANGE IN THE SDPI C-D FUNDING OPPORTUNITY, THE CONFEDERATED TRIBES AND BANDS OF THE YAKAMA NATION RECOGNIZED THAT BOTH PROGRAMS ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE IN THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF DIABETES IN OUR COMMUNITY.  THE TWO PROGRAMS WERE MERGED, WITH THE YNDP AS THE GRANTEE AND YHHP AS A SUB-CONTRACT WITHIN THE GRANT TO CONTINUE CLINICAL SERVICES. THE YNDP PROVIDES THE MAJORITY OF EFFORTS TOWARDS PROVIDING PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, EDUCATIONAL EVENTS AND COMMUNITY DRIVEN REQUESTS TO THE COMMUNITY WHILE THE YHHP PROVIDES INTENSE CLINICAL CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES.  THIS APPROACH HAS ALLOWED THE PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE KEY SERVICES IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DIABETES.  WITH INCREASED PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION AND THE NEGATIVE CONNOTATION ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES, YNDP CHANGED THEIR NAME TO YAKAMA NATION WAK\u2019ISHWI PROGRAM.  WAK\u2019ISHWI MEANS \u201cTO BE HEALTHY\u201d OR \u201cTO BECOME HEALTHY\u201d IN ICHISHK\u2019IIN, THE LANGUAGE OF THE YAKAMA NATION.  THE NAME CHANGE OPENED THE DOORS FOR MORE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO FEEL WELCOME AND UTILIZE THE SERVICES. IT IS THE MISSION OF THE MERGED PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE TO AI/AN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES OR THOSE WITH RISK FACTORS FOR DIABETES TO IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND PROVIDE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES TO TREAT AND PREVENT DIABETES IN OUR COMMUNITY USING CULTURE AND TRADITIONAL VALUES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e14bc777-36e9-f97c-95c3-eefc6a740e77-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_H1D1IHS1168_7527"}, {"internal_id": 155739012, "Award ID": "H1D1IHS1167", "Award Amount": 451764.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-12-21", "CFDA Number": "93.237", "Description": "SPECIAL DIABETES PROGRAM FOR INDIANS - THE TE-MOAK TRIBE DIABETES PROGRAM OFFERS GYM MEMBERSHIP TO THE PERFORMANCE ATHLETIC CLUB.

SCAHC HAS BEEN WORKING ON BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE DIABETES TREATMENT PROGRAM SPECIFIC TO THE SAN CARLOS APACHE TRIBE ALONGSIDE THE COMMUNITY DRIVEN DIABETES PREVENTION EFFORTS.  CONTINUOUS EFFORTS BY SDPI COUPLED WITH SCAHC FUNDS WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN ADDRESSING DIABETES AND ITS COMORBIDITIES ON THE SAN CARLOS APACHE RESERVATION. THE SAN CARLOS APACHE TRIBE HAS IDENTIFIED AN INCREASE IN DISEASE BURDEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT GRANT CYCLE FY2016-FY2022.  IN 2015, 1392 INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES WERE RECEIVING THEIR CARE IN SAN CARLOS.  IN MARCH 2020 PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC, WE IDENTIFIED 1743 INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES.  DURING THE PANDEMIC, AS MORE INDIVIDUALS BEGAN COMING IN TO SCAHC FOR ACUTE ILLNESS INCLUDING COVID INFECTIONS, THE HOSPITAL BEGAN TO IDENTIFY UNDIAGNOSED INDIVIDUALS WITH UNCONTROLLED DIABETES.  AS OF THIS YEAR, WE NOW HAVE OVER 1900 COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH DIABETES THAT ARE ACTIVELY RECEIVING THEIR CARE AT SCAHC AND AN ADDITIONAL 675 INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES THAT ARE NOT ACTIVELY RECEIVING THEIR CARE AT SCAHC. IN OUR EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY PREDIABETES AND DIABETES, SCAHC HAS TAKEN THE INITIATIVE OF COMPLETING GLUCOSE CHECKS WHEN PATIENTS ARRIVE FOR ANY APPOINTMENT.  SCAHC HAS ALSO ADDED A MOBILE HEALTH UNIT TO ASSIST IN PROVIDING HEALTHCARE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY TO INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY NOT HAVE OTHERWISE RECEIVED HEALTHCARE.  WITH THE ADDITION OF THIS MOBILE HEALTH UNIT, OUR HOPE IS THAT WE CAN BUILD TRUST WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDE HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION TO PREVENT THE ONSET OF DIABETES AND MANAGE DIABETES TO DECREASE THE RISK OF DIABETES-RELATED COMORBIDITIES.  WITHIN OUR SDPI CLINIC, WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE DIABETES EDUCATION AND MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE DIABETES CARE BY NURSE PRACTITIONERS, ENDOCRINOLOGISTS, A PODIATRIST, OPTOMETRISTS, DENTISTS, AND OUR PRIMARY CARE TEAM.  THROUGH THIS COMPREHENSIVE CARE APPROACH OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD LONG LASTING TRUST WITH THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND IN RETURN IMPROVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND DECREASE RISK OF DIABETES AND ALL ITS COMORBIDITIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2021, WE HAVE ALSO BUILT A 3-TIER COMPREHENSIVE WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM INCLUDING TIER 1 WITH NUTRITION AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS ONLY, TIER 2 ADDING MEDICATION ASSISTED WEIGHT LOSS AND TIER 3 COMPLETING BARIATRIC SURGERY WHEN TIER 1 AND 2 HAVE FAILED.  SINCE THEN, WE HAVE ~80 INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE UTILIZING OUR MEDICATION ASSISTED WEIGHT LOSS AND 21 INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE BARIATRIC/METABOLIC SURGERY.  MANY INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE OR COMPLETELY STOP THEIR CHRONIC MEDICATIONS. SAN CARLOS HAS ALSO IDENTIFIED ~2225 INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE PREDIABETES WHO WILL HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF IMPROVING THEIR HEALTH THROUGH LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS AND DECREASING THEIR WEIGHT THROUGH COMMUNITY OUTREACH, THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM, AND EARLY INTERVENTION OF DIETITIAN SUPPORT.  THE SDPI GRANT WOULD CONTINUE TO ASSIST IN GROWING OUR CURRENT AND NEW PROGRAMS.

ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\u2019S FOOD ACCESS RESEARCH ATLAS, THERE WERE EIGHT COUNTIES WITHIN THE C&A TRIBAL JURISDICTION WITH POPULATIONS THAT HAD LOW ACCESS TO A GROCERY STORE. LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORES ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF PURCHASING GROCERIES IN MANY ISOLATED C&A TRIBAL COMMUNITIES, AND ACCESSING HEALTHY FOODS IS FREQUENTLY LIMITED. LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FOR A HEALTHY DIET INCREASES THE RISK OF DEVELOPING DIABETES MELLITUS [DM], HINDERS ITS CONTROL AND ITS FUTURE COMPLICATIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE C&A TRIBAL POPULATION HAS STRUGGLED WITH HIGH POVERTY RATES, HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, AND LOW RATES OF INCOME ON A PER CAPITA BASIS AS COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION IN THE REGION. UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR THE C&A TRIBES HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION IN THE REGION. THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS REPORTED A 70% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG THE C&A TRIBES. IN COMPARISON, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA WAS 6.8%, WHILE THE NATIONWIDE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS 9.9%.
