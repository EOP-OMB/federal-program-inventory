THE NON-FEDERAL SHARE OF $5745827 WILL BE FUNDED BY METRA CAPITAL FUNDS. COMBINED THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT IS $28729135. THROUGH ITS PTC TESTING TO DATE METRA HAS DETERMINED THAT RELIABLE OPERATION OF THEIR SYSTEM OVER THE LONG TERM WILL REQUIRE GREATER RADIO SPECTRUM BANDWIDTH THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED AND COMPARED WITH WHAT IS AVAILABLE LONG-TERM THROUGH ITS CURRENT UTILITY LEASING PRACTICES FROM THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS. WHEN METRAS PTC SYSTEM BECOMES OPERABLE OVER ITS 1200-MILE SERVICE AREA ANY FAILURE DUE TO DEPENDENCY ON INSUFFICIENT THIRD-PARTY UTILITIES WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS IN DELAYS FOR COMMUTER AND FREIGHT OPERATIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL FUND THE INSTALLATION OF FIBER OPTIC CABLE ALONG METRAS ROCK ISLAND DISTRICT AND SOUTH WEST SERVICE LINES. THE FIBER OPTIC HARD-WIRED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BACK OFFICE SYSTEM (BOS) WAYSIDE AND SIGNAL SYSTEM THAT WILL CONNECT WIRELESSLY TO THE ONBOARD SYSTEMS OF METRA TRAINS OFFERS THE MOST RELIABLE LONG-TERM PTC SOLUTION.

IN 2018 METRA ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT TO PURCHASE UP TO 21 USED F59PHI AND THREE F59PH LOCOMOTIVES. THIS PROJECT WILL FUND THE PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF ONBOARD PTC EQUIPMENT ON THESE LOCOMOTIVES AS WELL AS SPARE PARTS FOR MAINTENANCE OF ALL ONBOARD PTC EQUIPMENT.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: METRAS PTC DESIGN IS A FIBER OPTIC HARD-WIRED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BACK OFFICE SYSTEM (BOS) WAYSIDE AND SIGNAL SYSTEM AND AND A WIRELESS CONNECTION TO ONBOARD SYSTEMS OF METRA TRAINS. THIS DESIGN OFFERS THE MOST RELIABLE LONG-TERM SOLUTION. THIS PROJECT WILL ENABLE METRA TO INSTALL THIS ESSENTIAL HARDWARE FOR LONG-TERM RELIABILITY OF THE PTC SYSTEM. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PTC IS FEDERALLY MANDATED AND WILL REDUCE SAFETY RISK. ONBOARD PTC EQUIPMENT ON NEWLY PURCHASED LOCOMOTIVES IS NECESSARY FOR METRAS OVERALL PTC READINESS.
