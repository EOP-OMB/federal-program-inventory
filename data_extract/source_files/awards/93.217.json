THE GA TITLE X PROGRAM, BRANDED AS  THE \u201cGEORGIA FAMILY PLANNING SYSTEM\u201d (GFPS), IS THE LARGEST AND MOST AMBITIOUS EFFORT IN THE NATION TO INTEGRATE TITLE X FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES INTO PRIMARY HEALTHCARE CENTERS. TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES INTO THE PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL HOME (PCMH) MODEL, FHCGA HAS BUILT ROBUST TRAINING, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SYSTEMS.

FOUR TELEHEALTH PROVIDER TEAMS WILL BE DEPLOYED IN THE NORTH, WEST CENTRAL, EAST CENTRAL, AND SOUTH SECTIONS OF THE STATE WITH A FOCUS ON ENGAGING POPULATIONS FROM RURAL, OUTLYING COUNTIES WITH LOW ENROLLMENT IN GFPS SERVICES. IN ADDITION TO FHCGA, THREE FQHC MEMBERS OF GFPS WHO ARE LOCATED IN THOSE REGIONS WILL LEAD LOCAL EFFORTS TO EXPAND TELEHEALTH SERVICES. THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR TELEHEALTH (GPT) WILL BE ENGAGED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING, ASSISTING PROJECT PARTNERS IN LEVERAGING TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES FOR UNDERSERVED AND LOW RESOURCE COMMUNITIES. A COMPELLING OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGN TARGETING 100,000 RESIDENTS WILL BE LAUNCHED WITH A SINGLE STATEWIDE PHONE NUMBER LINKING CLIENTS TO RESOURCES, INTAKE, AND APPOINTMENT SETTING FOR SYNCHRONOUS INTERACTIONS WITH THE DEDICATED TELEHEALTH FAMILY PLANNING PROVIDERS. A TELEHEALTH WORKGROUP WILL BE ORGANIZED TO HELP GUIDE AND PLAN THE PROJECT, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OF A TELEHEALTH OPERATIONALIZATION PLAN. STRONG TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENTS, INCLUDING FOR BILLING AND REIMBURSEMENT OF TELEHEALTH VISITS, WILL HELP TO SUSTAIN THE PROJECT BEYOND THE ONE-YEAR PROJECT PERIOD AND SUPPORT THE SPREAD OF SUCCESSFUL TELEHEALTH STRATEGIES TO OTHER GFPS MEMBERS IN FUTURE YEARS.

IMPROVING SERVICE QUALITY AND REACH OF FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES IN THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA (FSM). - PROJECT ABSTRACT: THE FSM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS HAS APPLIED FOR A RENEWAL OF OUR 5-YEAR TITLE X GRANT TO CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES THROUGH THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA.  THE FSM CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A HIGH TOTAL FERTILITY RATE (3.13 CHILDREN PER WOMAN); A HIGH  ADOLESCENT FERTILITY RATE (18.3 PER 1,000 FEMALES AGED 15-17 YEARS); A HIGH PERINATAL MORTALITY RATE (37.2PER 1,000 LIVE BIRTHS); A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHTS (7.2%); AND A LOW PREVALENCE RATE OF MOST OR MODERATELY EFFECTIVE CONTRACEPTIVE USAGE (56.3%), ALL OF WHICH HAVE TARGETED REDUCTIONS IN OUR NEW GRANT CYCLE.  GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATIONS TO A FULL RANGE OF CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICES, THAT ARE PARTICULAR TO FSM, RELATE TO ITS WIDELY DISPERSED ISLANDS WITH POCKETS OF POPULATIONS RESIDING ON THEM WITH INFREQUENT SHIPPING AND POOR COMMUNICATION SERVICES. THIS BARRIER IS A PRIORITY TO BE ADDRESSED DURING THIS GRANT CYCLE BY INCREASING SERVICES TO THE HARD-TO-REACH POPULATIONS THROUGH EXISTING TELEHEALTH STATIONS SETUP DURING THE COVID-19 PREPARATION IN THE FSM. FSM FAMILY PLANNING SERVICE ALSO INTENDS TO APPLY FOR THE OASH FAMILY PLANNING TELEHEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENT AND EXPANSION GRANT TO INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO USE TELEHEALTH TO IMPROVE OUR OUTREACH ACTIVITIES.  THE FAMILY PLANNING TITLE X PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ISSUES RELATING TO THOSE WOMEN AT RISK BY VIRTUE OF THEIR AGE, PARITY, SPACING, MARITAL STATUS AND/OR PHYSICAL HEALTH, E.G. FETAL DEATHS. HOWEVER, THE HIGH PRIORITIES TO BE PARTICULARLY ADDRESSED DURING THIS GRANT PERIOD ARE THE VULNERABLE POPULATION OF TEENAGERS OR ADOLESCENTS AND THE HARD-TO-REACH POPULATIONS ON THE OUTER ISLANDS. STATES WILL ENSURE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL SETTINGS AND ARE WELL  INTEGRATED WITH OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, INCLUDING OBSTETRICS CARE, HIV/STI COUNSELING  AND TESTING, BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING AND WITH LINKAGES FOR TREATMENT OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. IN ADDITION, THE FAMILY PLANNI NG PROGRAM WILL BE STRENGTHENED THROUGH IMPROVING QUALITY THROUGH POLICY AND PROCEDURE UPDATES UNDER OUR NEW QA/QI PLAN,  ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTATION OF PROGRAM SERVICES INCLUDING THE FPAR 2.0, EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES AT NEW LOCATIONS INCLUDING REMOTE AND OUTER ISLAND VILLAGES, AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PLANNING. MUCH ATTENTION WILL BE FOCUSED ON PROMOTING MOST OR MODERATELY EFFECTIVE METHODS THROUGH PATIENT- CENTERED, NON-COERCIVE EDUCATION AND COUNSELING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FM", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "89c9230f-fd3e-4dc6-12b3-240632c0635e-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_FPHPA006546_7521"}, {"internal_id": 147540955, "Award ID": "FPHPA006545", "Award Amount": 6930000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-03-24", "CFDA Number": "93.217", "Description": "THE TITLE X FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO CONSIST OF SEVEN SUBRECIPIENTS AGENCIES PROVIDING FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES THROUGH 12 CLINICS SITES ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH OF PR.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8c1ec519-5f65-cd50-5513-3bebb8a38de4-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_FPHPA006545_7521"}, {"internal_id": 147669835, "Award ID": "FPHPA006544", "Award Amount": 4500000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-01", "CFDA Number": "93.217", "Description": "PLANNED PARENTHOOD ASSOCIATION OF UTAH - TITLE X PROJECT 2022-2027 - PPAU HAS BEEN PROVIDING FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES TO THE INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT UTAH FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS, WITH 40 OF THOSE YEARS AS THE SOLE UTAH GRANTEE OF TITLE X FUNDS.

ADDITIONALLY, PPAU ASSUMES LEGAL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE AWARDED FUNDS AND FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ACTIVITIES APPROVED FOR FUNDING. \tON AUGUST 21, 2019, PPAU MADE THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO SUBMIT ITS \u201cRELINQUISHMENT STATEMENT\u201d TO THE OFFICE OF GRANTS MANAGEMENT TO OFFICIALLY WITHDRAW FROM THE TITLE X PROGRAM AS SOME OF THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AT THAT TIME WERE CONTRARY TO PPAU\u2019S MISSION. AS A RESULT, PPAU RELINQUISHED $1,408,004.43, AND WAS NO LONGER PARTICIPATING IN TITLE X. THIS MARKS THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE TITLE X PROGRAM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO TITLE X PROVIDERS IN UTAH. HOWEVER, DUE TO PPAU\u2019S STRONG COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING ACCURATE AND HIGH-QUALITY FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES, PPAU CONTINUED PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES AT SEVEN (7) PPAU HEALTH CENTERS LOCATED IN FIVE (5) COUNTIES THROUGHOUT UTAH . PPAU\u2019S SEVEN (7) TITLE X FAMILY PLANNING CLINICS ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF UTAH, ONE (1) WITHIN A RURAL COUNTY WITH THE REMAINING SIX (6) LOCATED WITHIN URBAN COUNTIES.

THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS MAPPED THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS WITHIN UTAH . THIS MAP ILLUSTRATES HOW IMPORTANT PPAU\u2019S SERVICES ARE TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AS PPAU\u2019S FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC LOCATIONS ALIGN WITH THE AREAS WITH THE GREATEST NEED. PRIOR TO 2019, THE MONIES RECEIVED FROM TITLE X PROVIDED A SAFEGUARD FOR PPAU TO CONTINUE PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION FOR CLIENTS SERVED THROUGHOUT UTAH.

THE CORE STRATEGIES OF PPAU\u2019S PLAN INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: -\tPROVIDE ALL UTAHNS ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE. -\tUTILIZE A RACE, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND ACCESSIBILITY LENS TO INCREASE EQUITY AMONGST CLIENTS, VOLUNTEERS, AND STAFF. -\tADVOCATE FOR PUBLIC POLICIES THAT ADVANCE A CULTURE OF PROUD AND AUTHENTIC SEXUALITY AND IDENTITY, FREE FROM STIGMA AND JUDGMENT. -\tPROVIDE ALL UTAHNS WITH THE ACCURATE, RELIABLE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE RESPONSIBLE CHOICES AND STAY HEALTHY AND HAPPY. -\tINCREASE AWARENESS OF AND SUPPORT FOR PPAU\u2019S ROLE IN STRENGTHENING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN UTAH. -\tMANAGE A FINANCIALLY SECURE AND HIGHLY RESPECTED NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION.

INSTEAD, THEY ACTIVELY WORKED TO DISMANTLE THE NH FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM BY DRASTICALLY CUTTING THE OVERALL PROGRAM BUDGET AND REJECTING THE PARTICIPATION OF THREE MAJOR FAMILY PLANNING SERVICE PROVIDERS. THE FINAL FY21 BUDGET SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR SUNUNU, REQUIRED NH DHHS TO COMPLETE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AUDITS OF ALL NEW HAMPSHIRE FAMILY PLANNING PROVIDERS TO CONFIRM THAT STATE FAMILY PLANNING FUNDS AREN\u2019T USED FOR ABORTION CARE. STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ALREADY PROHIBITED FROM GOING TOWARD ABORTION CARE.  THESE NEW AUDIT REQUIREMENTS WERE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, OVERREACHING, AND UNNECESSARY.

AFTER COMPLETING THE AUDIT, THE NH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STATED UNEQUIVOCALLY, MULTIPLE TIMES THAT THE FINANCIAL REVIEW, CLEARLY SHOWED THAT NO FAMILY PLANNING FUNDS HAD BEEN USED FOR ABORTION CARE. REGARDLESS OF FINANCIAL ASSURANCES, ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2021, NEW HAMPSHIRE\u2019S EXECUTIVE COUNCIL VOTED 4-1 TO REJECT CONTRACTS FOR PPNNE AND TWO OTHER FAMILY PLANNING PROVIDERS WHO PROVIDE ABORTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH TITLE X STATUTES AND REGULATIONS.
