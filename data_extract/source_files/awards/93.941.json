TRANSITIONING FROM STATE PRISON TO THE COMMUNITY - ABSTRACTTHE PROPOSED FREE WORLD BOUND TEXAS (FWBTX) PROJECT RESPONDING TO CDC-RFA-PS20-2011 FOCUSES ON CREATING A SUSTAINABLE, STATEWIDE NETWORK TO SUCCESSFULLY FACILITATE RE-ENTRY AND CONTINUITY OF CARE AND SUSTAINED HIV VIRAL SUPPRESSION FOR PERSONS WITH HIV (PWH) RELEASED FROM THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE PROJECT WILL BRIDGE PRISON-TO-COMMUNITY TRANSITION THROUGH DEVELOPING CAPACITY THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF TEXAS, HIGHLY MOBILE INTERVENTION TEAMS AND VIRTUAL, SYNCHRONOUS AUDIOVISUAL INTERACTIONS THROUGH TELEHEALTH. PARTNER SITES WILL FURTHER BE SUPPORTED BY EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO SERVE THE POPULATION OF FOCUS AND THROUGH PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE MODEL OF CARE. FWBTX EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON CREATING AND STRENGTHENING INFRASTRUCTURES IN AREAS THAT EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF RE-ENTRY AMONG PWH TRANSITIONING FROM PRISON TO THE COMMUNITY. THESE AREAS INCLUDE NORTH TEXAS PARTICULARLY DALLAS COUNTY, DALLAS TX AND TARRANT COUNTY, FORT WORTH TX; TRAVIS COUNTY, HOUSTON TX; BEXAR COUNTY, SAN ANTONIO TX; AND THE COUNTIES OF BROWNSVILLE, HARLINGEN AND MCALLEN, TX IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY. THE PROJECT WILL EXPAND ITS AREAS OF FOCUS DURING THE PLANNING PHASE TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS IN TEXAS WHERE RATES OF RE-ENTRY FOR PWH ARE ALSO NOTABLE.FWBTX WILL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A SYSTEMS-LEVEL APPROACH TO ENSURING CONTINUITY OF HIV MEDICAL CARE FOR PWH RELEASED FROM TEXAS STATE PRISONS INTO THE COMMUNITY. FWBTX WILL IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE, COST-EFFICIENT, CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE, EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON LINKAGE TO AND RETENTION IN COMMUNITY HIV MEDICAL CARE, ADHERENCE TO HIV TREATMENT, SUPPRESSION OF HIV VIRAL LOAD, STRATEGIES FOR IDENTIFYING PWH, AND SEX AND DRUG INJECTION PARTNERS/ASSOCIATES OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AND LINKING THEM TO NECESSARY CARE INCLUDING TESTING FOR HIV AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED IN FECTIONS (STIS), AS WELL AS HIV AND STI TREATMENT, AND PREVENTION SERVICES.THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE AN EVALUATION STUDY TO FURTHER MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECT WITHIN THE LOCAL CARE SETTING INCLUDING PARTNER-SITES. THE STUDY WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING KEY QUESTIONS A) WHAT SUB-POPULATION DISPARITIES EXIST AMONG THE PROJECT POPULATION; AND B) WHAT CHANGES OCCURRED TO SUPPORT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT.

OUR APPROACH LEVERAGES LONG-STANDING COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH NYS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND COMMUNITY SERVICES (DOCCS) AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS (CBO) THAT WORK WITH PWH INCARCERATED OR RECENTLY RELEASED FROM DOCCS FACILITIES. THE AI HAS A LONG-STANDING, 30-YEAR HISTORY OF WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH DOCCS AND CBOS TO SERVE INCARCERATED AND RECENTLY RELEASED PWH AND HIV-NEGATIVE PERSONS ENGAGING IN HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE (CJI). THROUGH OUR CJI PROGRAMMING, CBOS THROUGHOUT THE STATE PROVIDE IN-FACILITY PRE-RELEASE LINKAGE AND NAVIGATION SERVICES, PEER EDUCATION AND TRAINING, HIV/STI/HEPATITIS PREVENTION, TRAUMA INFORMED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, AND ANONYMOUS HIV TESTING. IN ADDITION TO PRE-RELEASE SERVICES, THREE (3) CBOS PROVIDE COMMUNITY REENTRY LINKAGE AND NAVIGATION SERVICES FOR PWH WHO ARE RELEASING TO THE NEW YORK CITY METRO AREA. OUR PROJECT WILL ENSURE THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED TO PWH RETURNING TO COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE OF NYC, SPECIFICALLY UPSTATE NEW YORK (HUDSON VALLEY, CAPITAL REGION AND NORTH COUNTRY, CENTRAL NY, FINGER LAKES REGION AND WESTERN NY).

BARRIERS TO REENTRY/ENGAGEMENT IN CARE IN UNY INCLUDE LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN MORE RURAL AREAS; FEWER MEDICAL PROVIDERS, MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS, SUBSTANCE USE PROVIDERS, HIV SPECIALISTS, AND OTHER COMPLEX HEALTH AND SOCIAL/SERVICE PROVIDERS. EXISTING CJI PROVIDERS SERVING UPSTATE NY ARE WELL-ESTABLISHED CBOS THAT OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR PWH THAT CAN BE ACCESSED BY RECENTLY RELEASED PWH.
