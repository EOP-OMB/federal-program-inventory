THE ACTION FOR THIS GRANT IS TO INVESTIGATE LANDOWNER KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTIONS OF MYCOTOXINS IN WILDLIFE FEEDS AND OPINIONS ON IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICES ON SUPPLEMENTAL FEED FOR WILDLIFE THAT HAS A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR MYCOTOXINS. SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING, BROADLY DEFINED AS INTENTIONAL, ANTHROPOGENIC PROVISIONING OF FOOD FOR WILDLIFE, IS A COMMON PRACTICE AMONG PROFESSIONAL WILDLIFE MANAGERS AND BOTH CONSUMPTIVE AND NON-CONSUMPTIVE WILDLIFE ENTHUSIASTS. IT IS INTENDED FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF PURPOSES SUCH AS WILDLIFE VIEWING AND PHOTOGRAPHY, RECREATION/HUNTING, CONDUCTING RESEARCH, DELIVERING MEDICATIONS, AND RESTORING NATURAL DIET-LIMITED WILDLIFE POPULATIONS, AMONG OTHERS (MURRAY ET AL. 2016). ALTHOUGH IT IS KNOWN TO HAVE SOME BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON WILDLIFE, PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE THAT MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A RELIABLE FOOD SOURCE (MURRAY ET AL. 2016), WILDLIFE FEEDING CAN HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES BOTH FOR TARGET AND NON-TARGET SPECIES ACCESSING THE FOOD RESOURCES. AMONG THESE CONSEQUENCES, GRAINS OFFERED TO WILDLIFE CAN HARBOR CONTAMINANTS THAT CAN LEAD TO SEVERE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON WILDLIFE HEALTH (MURRAY ET AL. 2016). IN PARTICULAR, THESE FOODS MAY BE CONTAMINATED WITH MYCOTOXIN - A TOXIC METABOLIC BYPRODUCT FROM FUNGAL GROWTH.

HUNTING PRESSURE IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS HAVING A SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE ON WATERFOWL HABITAT USE AND DISTRIBUTION (MADSEN AND FOX 1995, DOOLEY ET AL. 2010). SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE IMPORTANCE OF REFUGIA (I.E., AREAS FREE FROM HUNTING PRESSURE) TO WATERFOWL DURING HUNTING SEASON (DINGES, ET AL. 2015, GIROUX AND BEDARD 1988, EVANS AND DAY 2002, MADSEN 1998). REFUGIA HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO INCREASE WATERFOWL ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE REFUGES AND, THUS, HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AS AN EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT TOOL TO IMPROVE CONSERVATION VALUE AND BIODIVERSITY OF WETLANDS (MADSEN 1998). TO DATE, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF REFUGIA HAS ONLY BEEN QUALIFIED VISUALLY AND LIMITED BY HUMAN OBSERVER TIME AND SPHERE OF VISUAL AND AUDITORY DETECTION. ALTHOUGH THESE TECHNIQUES (E.G., AERIAL SURVEYS, GROUND COUNTS) HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE TO DEMONSTRATE THE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF HUNTING-FREE AREAS ON RELATIVELY LOCAL WATERFOWL COMMUNITY DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE, A NEED EXISTS TO APPLY MORE QUANTITATIVE METRICS TO THE DESIGN AND ALLOCATION OF REFUGIA ACROSS LARGER LANDSCAPES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR POPULATIONS THAT ARE LIMITED BY WINTER RESOURCES (FOX AND MADSEN, 1997). WELL-DESIGNED LANDSCAPE-SCALE STUDIES DEMAND STANDARDIZED EQUIPMENT AND PROTOCOLS THAT GENERATE REPEATABLE AND RELIABLE DATA TO DRAW ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT INFERENCES AND CONCLUSIONS (PEREIRA AND COOPER 2006). AUDIO RECORDING UNITS (ARUS) HAVE BEEN USED IN AN ECOLOGICAL CONTEXT SINCE THE 1970S AND HAVE SPECIFICALLY BEEN EMPLOYED IN AVIAN STUDIES WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS (PREZ-GRANADOS, ET AL. 2018, CELIS-MURILLO ET AL. 2009, SHONFIELD AND BAYNE 2017, PREZGRANADOS AND TRABA 2021).

HUTCHINSII SUBSPECIES DOMINATES THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE MIDCONTINENT REGION DURING THE NON-BREEDING PERIOD (MLODINOW ET AL. 2008), AND THE CACKLING GOOSE IS REPORTED TO BE PHILOPATRIC TO WINTERING AREAS AND STOPOVER SITES DURING MIGRATION (MOWBRAY ET AL. 2020). THERE HAS BEEN CHANGES IN THE WINTER DISTRIBUTION OF CACKLING GEESE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. AT A LARGER SCALE, CACKLING GEESE HAVE MOVED THEIR WINTER DISTRIBUTION NORTHWARD. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE PACIFIC FLYWAY WHERE THEY HISTORICALLY WINTERED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA, NOW WINTER PRIMARILY IN THE WILLAMETTE VALLEY OF OREGON (JARVIS AND BROMLEY 1998). SIMILARLY, THEY ARE ALMOST NON-EXISTENT ALONG THE TEXAS COAST WHERE THEY WERE HIGHLY ABUNDANT AS RECENT AS THE LATE 1990S (TPWD, UNPUBLISHED DATA). AT A SMALLER SCALE, THE INCREASED USE OF URBAN LANDSCAPES HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE SPECIES' EXISTING RANGE. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CACKLING GOOSE AS A GAME SPECIES, THESE CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION HAVE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS TO HARVEST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ON WINTERING AREAS. FURTHER, INVESTIGATIONS OF DISTRIBUTION, MIGRATORY CONNECTIVITY AMONG SUBSPECIES, AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BREEDING AND WINTERING BIOLOGY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITIES FOR RESEARCH FOR THE CACKLING GOOSE (MOWBRAY ET AL. 2020). THESE ARE ALL OBJECTIVES THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED WITH A WELL-DESIGNED TRACKING STUDY. THE ADVANCEMENT OF TRACKING DEVICE TECHNOLOGY HAS ALLOWED EFFECTIVE TRACKING OF SMALLER SPECIES OF BIRDS THROUGHOUT THE ANNUAL CYCLE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 22 G NECK COLLAR DEVICE WE PROPOSE TO USE IN THIS STUDY IS SOLAR RECHARGEABLE WITH A THEORETICAL LIFE OF 1 YEAR, IS ABLE TO HANDLE AGGRESSIVE DUTY CYCLES FOR LOCATION ACQUISITION WHEN IN GOOD CELL COVERAGE, AND IS ONLY ABOUT 1% OF THE BIRD'S BODY MASS. THESE FULLY AUTOMATED DEVICES ALLOW CONTINUAL REMOTE TRACKING WHILE THE BIRD IS WITHIN CELL NETWORK COVERAGE. WHEN THE BIRD IS OUTSIDE OF CELL COVERAGE, SUCH AS WHEN IN THEIR ARCTIC BREEDING AREAS, THE DEVICE STORES ALL DATA UNTIL IT RETURNS TO CELL NETWORK COVERAGE WHEN IT UPLOADS DATA TO A SERVER. THUS, THE ABILITY TO MONITOR MOVEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE ANNUAL CYCLE ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND CRITICAL ASPECTS OF THEIR NON-BREEDING ECOLOGY THAT IS OF INTEREST TO RESOURCE MANAGERS.

IN MANY UNGULATE SPECIES, ANNUAL VARIATION IN RECRUITMENT IS THE PRIMARY DETERMINANT OF POPULATION GROWTH GIVENADULT SURVIVAL TENDS TO BE RELATIVELY HIGH AND INVARIABLE. IN MULE DEER, RECRUITMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF THREEVITAL RATES: PREGNANCY, FETAL RATE, AND SURVIVAL OF OFFSPRING TO ONE YEAR. NUTRITIONAL CONDITION OF FEMALE MULEDEER SHOULD HAVE A STRONG EFFECT ON REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE AND SURVIVAL OF OFFSPRING IF NUTRITIONAL RESOURCESARE LIMITED ON THE LANDSCAPE. THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF FORAGE ON SUMMER RANGE WILL AFFECT NUTRITIONALCONDITION OF FEMALES ENTERING WINTER, WHICH IN TURN WILL AFFECT OTHER VITAL RATES INCLUDING: 1) PREGNANCY RATES,2) FETAL RATES, 3) NEONATE BIRTH MASS AND GROWTH RATES, 4) JUVENILE SURVIVAL AND RECRUITMENT, AND 5) FINALLY ADULT SURVIVAL. AS THE SEVERITY OF NUTRITIONAL LIMITATION INCREASES, IT WOULD BE EXPECTED THAT VITAL RATESAFFECTING OFFSPRING WOULD DECLINE FIRST, AS THE MATERNAL FEMALE WILL USE NUTRITIONAL RESOURCES TO ENSURE SURVIVALTO THE NEXT YEAR WHEN CONDITIONS MAY BE BETTER (E.G., A BET-HEDGING STRATEGY OF REPRODUCTION).

THE DISEASE SPREADS VIA ANIMAL-TO-ANIMAL CONTACT, OR UPTAKE FROM INFECTIOUS PRIONS DEPOSITED IN THE ENVIRONMENT. CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE WAS DETECTED IN MULE DEER IN THE HUECO MOUNTAINS OF TRANS-PECOS TEXAS IN JULY 2012 (TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT AND TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION 2012). IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE DISEASE WAS TRANSMITTED VIA NATURAL EXPANSION FROM AN ENDEMIC AREA IN SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO. TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT (TPWD) AND TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION (TAHC) IMMEDIATELY ENACTED A DISEASE-MANAGEMENT PLAN AIMED TO DETERMINE THE GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT AND PREVALENCE OF CWD, AND REDUCE RISKS OF THE DISEASE SPREADING OUT OF THE AFFECTED REGION. THE DISEASE HAS SINCE BEEN DETECTED IN FREE-RANGING MULE DEER, WHITE-TAILED DEER, AND ELK IN DALLAM AND HARTLEY COUNTIES, LOCATED IN THE NORTHWEST PANHANDLE. INFECTED INDIVIDUALS PROBABLY EXPANDED THE RANGE OF THE DISEASE VIA NATURAL MOVEMENTS FROM ENDEMIC AREAS IN NEIGHBORING STATES. TEXAS CERVIDS ARE NOT MIGRATORY, BUT MAY MAKE LARGE SEASONAL MOVEMENTS. IN FREE-RANGING POPULATIONS, NATURAL MOVEMENTS AND DISPERSAL ARE A PRIMARY INFLUENCE ON SPREAD OF CWD.

FIRE IS A NATURAL PART OF THIS ECOSYSTEM, AND FIRE SUPPRESSIONHAS LED TO SHRUB COMMUNITIES BECOMING DECADENT, OAK WOODLANDS BEING INVADED BY CONIFERS, LOSS OF NATURAL OPENINGSAND MEADOWS, REDUCTION OF NATIVE PLANT SPECIES, AND LESS EARLY SERAL STAGE VEGETATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "37a1fb0b-1748-278b-137d-d90e1c816b0e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F22AF01362_1448"}, {"internal_id": 148676570, "Award ID": "F22AF01361", "Award Amount": 277618.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-05-04", "CFDA Number": "15.611", "Description": "THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (CDFW) WILL CONTINUE THE MOUNTAIN LION (PUMA CONCOLOR) CONSERVATION PROGRAM WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN PART WITH WSFR FUNDING IN 2014 TO COORDINATE MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION RESEARCH AND MONITORING AND TO INFORM BIG GAME MANAGEMENT, SPECIES MANAGEMENT PLANS AND HABITAT CONSERVATION AND PROTECTION. GIVEN THAT PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO ESTIMATE 1) STATEWIDE ABUNDANCE, 2) HABITAT USE PATTERNS, 3) GENE FLOW, AND 4) HEALTH STATUS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED, THE MOUNTAIN LION PROGRAM WILL NOW FOCUS ON: 1) CONNECTIVITY AND GENE FLOW; 2) HUMAN-MOUNTAIN LION INTERACTIONS; 3) COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; AND 4) DEVELOPING POPULATION MONITORING TECHNIQUES. THE FOUR PROGRAM PRIORITIES ARE OUTLINED IN DELLINGER ET AL. 2021. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS PROGRAM WAS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WHO HAVE VOICED CONCERN OVER CALIFORNIA'S MOUNTAIN LION POPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DEER (ODOCOILEUS SPP.) HUNTERS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION IS INCREASING AND THUS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING DEER HERDS BY HIGH RATES OF PREDATION. CONVERSELY, CERTAIN NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE COMBINATION OF MORTALITY FACTORS (E.G. HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION, VEHICLE STRIKES, HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, DEPREDATION TAKE, DISEASE AND TOXICANTS ETC.) IS LIKELY CAUSING THE STATE'S MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION TO DECLINE IN NUMBERS AND GENETIC DIVERSITY TO A POINT THAT WOULD THREATEN THE POPULATION'S VIABILITY. CDFW THEN UNDERTOOK A RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO ESTIMATING MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION STATUS (I.E., ABUNDANCE, GENETICS, HABITAT USE, HEALTH, AND DISEASE PREVALENCE) STATEWIDE (DELLINGER ET AL. 2021). IN DOING SO CDFW IDENTIFIED AREAS OF FURTHER RESEARCH NEED WITH RELATION TO MOUNTAIN LIONS. THESE NEW PRIORITIES ARE: 1) CONNECTIVITY AND GENE FLOW; 2) HUMAN-MOUNTAIN LION INTERACTIONS; 3) COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; AND 4) DEVELOPING POPULATION MONITORING TECHNIQUES. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT HAS IMPACTED ABILITY OF SUBADULT MOUNTAIN LIONS TO DISPERSE FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER IN CERTAIN AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. THIS HAS LIMITED GENE FLOW AND INCREASED INBREEDING. MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE MITIGATION MEASURES (E.G., ROAD-CROSSING STRUCTURES) CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TO IMPROVE HABITAT CONNECTIVITY AND GENE FLOW. HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY IS ADDITIVE IN MOUNTAIN LIONS AND THUS NEGATIVELY IMPACTS MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION STABILITY AND THUS IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO MITIGATE HUMAN-CAUSED MORTALITY. MOUNTAIN LIONS ARE THE MAIN PREDATORS FOR MANY ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY IMPORTANT BIG GAME SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA, SOME OF WHICH ARE STATE AND FEDERALLY LISTED AS THREATENED OR ENDANGERED. FURTHER, MOUNTAIN LIONS COMPETE WITH CO-OCCURRING BIG GAME SPECIES (I.E., BLACK BEARS) AND STATE LISTED ENDANGERED SPECIES (I.E., GRAY WOLVES). THUS, UNDERSTANDING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE PREDATION RATES ON UNGULATES AND CO-OCCURRENCE AMONGST LARGE CARNIVORES CAN INFORM MANAGEMENT OF BIG GAME AND THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES.

THE OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW OR HUNT MOOSE IS SOUGHT AFTER BY MANY AND BOTH OF THESE ACTIVITIES GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE'S MOOSE POPULATION HAS DECLINED 50% SINCE 2000, PRIMARILY DUE TO CLIMATE-ENHANCED PARASITISM FROM WINTER TICKS. ACCURATE MOOSE ABUNDANCE DATA IS ESSENTIAL FOR MANAGING THIS POPULATION AND THE CURRENT METHOD, MOOSE SIGHTING RATE BY DEER HUNTERS (DEER HUNTER SURVEY), NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. THIS MONITORING TECHNIQUE WAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED STARTING IN 1998 WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WOULD BE RE-CALIBRATED PERIODICALLY TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN MOOSE DENSITY AND HUNTER BEHAVIOR. GIVEN OVER 20 YEARS HAVE LAPSED SINCE CALIBRATION AND WIDESPREAD PUBLIC CONCERN OVER THE STATUS OF THE DECLINING MOOSE POPULATION, IT IS NOW TIME TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCURACY OF THIS SURVEY AND OTHER MOOSE MONITORING TECHNIQUES. TO INVESTIGATE SURVEY ACCURACY, IT IS BEST TO HAVE A \"TRUTH\" DATA LAYER THAT CLOSELY MEASURES MOOSE DENSITY AT A FINE SCALE. THE BEST APPROACH FOR DOING THIS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS WITH AERIAL INFRARED SURVEYS FROM A PLANE, HOWEVER CONTRACTORS THAT CONDUCT THIS WORK ARE SCARCE AND COST IS HIGH.THIS STUDY WILL DEVELOP AND EVALUATE NOVEL METHODS FOR MONITORING MOOSE ABUNDANCE THAT WILL ALSO SERVE TO RE-CALIBRATE THE DEER HUNTER SURVEY.
