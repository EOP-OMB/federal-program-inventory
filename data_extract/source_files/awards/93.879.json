IN THE AREA OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVENTION, REAL TIME AND NON-BIASED SEQUENCE DATA ARE ESSENTIAL FOR EARLY DETECTION OF THREATS TO MITIGATE OUTBREAKS, EPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT AIMS TO INNOVATE IN THE CREATION AND ACCESSIBILITY OF METAGENOMIC SEQUENCE DATA RELATING TO INFECTIOUS AGENTS BY LEVERAGING THE POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE TOOL OF WASTEWATER-BASED EPIDEMIOLOGY (WBE). THE WBE APPROACH EMPLOYS ANALYSIS OF COMMUNITY WASTEWATER FROM LARGE POPULATIONS TO ENABLE NON-INVASIVE, NEAR REAL-TIME MONITORING OF BOTH SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS. WHEN COMBINED WITH HIGH-THROUGHPUT METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING (HTS), THE RESULTING WBE-HTS APPROACH IS PROMISING FOR DETECTING A BROAD SPECTRUM OF INFECTIOUS AGENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY WITHOUT ANY A PRIORI ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT VIRUS IDENTITY OR PRESENCE. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE PROCESSING OF AGGREGATED METAGENOMIC SEQUENCE DATA ON VIRUSES DETECTABLE IN U.S. WASTEWATER CAN SERVE TO IDENTIFY VULNERABILITIES, OUTBREAKS AND EPIDEMICS EARLY, THEREBY CREATING A NOVEL AND POTENTIALLY LIFE-SAVING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH FOR PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH.  FOR HYPOTHESIS TESTING, THE TEAM WILL LEVERAGE ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY'S HUMAN HEALTH OBSERVATORY (HHO), THE LARGEST SEWAGE MONITORING NETWORK AND LARGEST ARCHIVE OF SEWAGE AND SLUDGE SAMPLES WORLDWIDE, REPRESENTING MORE THAN 200 U.S. CITIES AND OVER 300 CITIES GLOBALLY.  THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP A BROADLY APPLICABLE ONLINE BIOINFORMATICS FRAMEWORK AND TO DEMONSTRATE ITS UTILITY IN A CASE STUDY EMPLOYING WBE AND HTS.  THE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO: (I) INVENTORY VIRUSES EXTANT IN THE U.S. IN A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE, USING EXISTING DATABASE SOURCES AND WBE; (II) GENERATE A KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORY AND ONLINE PORTAL OF METAGENOMIC DATA TO SUPPORT NEAR REAL-TIME SURVEILLANCE OF THE HUMAN\u2013ASSOCIATED VIROME, AND (III) EVALUATE THE UTILITY OF THE WBE BIOINFORMATICS FRAMEWORK FOR TRACKING VIRAL OUTBREAKS AND EPIDEMICS.

HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS DOLLARS TO THE US HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ANNUALLY. POORLY MANAGED ACUTE POP OFTEN LEADS TO INCREASED MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, AND MANY OTHER COMPLICATIONS, SUCH AS CHRONIC POP AND OPIOID OVERUSE. ACCURATE PREDICTION OF POP OUTCOMES AND IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDINGS OF CAUSAL MECHANISMS OF POP IS CRITICAL TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE POP MANAGEMENT. ALSO, MANY POP STUDIES INDICATE HETEROGENEITY OF RESPONSES TO ANESTHESIA METHODS AND POSTOPERATIVE SUBSTANCE USE, SUGGESTING A CRITICAL NEED FOR EFFECTIVE METHODS TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY PATIENT SUBGROUPS FOR MORE EFFECTIVE POP MANAGEMENT TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT'S NEEDS. HOWEVER, ACHIEVING THESE GOALS IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THE COMPLEX POP MECHANISMS AND LIMITED DATA FROM IDEAL LARGE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. ON THE OTHER HAND, ABUNDANT OBSERVATIONAL POP DATA FOUND IN SURGERY PATIENTS' ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) ARE READILY AVAILABLE, AND THEY CAN SERVE AS A COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL CHALLENGES IN POP MANAGEMENT.  HOWEVER, THE ETIOLOGY OF POP IS INTRICATE, I.E. MANY FACTORS MAY INTERWEAVE WITH EACH OTHER AND IMPACT POP OUTCOMES NON-LINEARLY AND NON-ADDITIVELY, INTRODUCING DAUNTING MODELING CHALLENGES. FURTHERMORE, CONFOUNDING, A MAJOR CONCERN ASSOCIATED WITH OBSERVATIONAL DATA, REPRESENTS A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE FOR CONDUCTING CAUSAL ANALYSIS ON POP DATA. ALSO, POP OUTCOMES SUCH AS POP INTENSITY SCORES ARE OFTEN IRREGULARLY AND REPEATEDLY MEASURED, AND DISTRIBUTED NON-NORMALLY WITH TWO DISTINCT DATA PROCESSES, REQUIRING MORE ADVANCED ANALYSIS METHODS. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO OVERCOME THESE ANALYTIC AND MODELING CHALLENGES WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART DEEP LEARNING METHODS TO IMPROVE POP MANAGEMENT. SPECICALLY, WE WILL 1) ESTABLISH ROBUST DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR MORE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC POP TO ACHIEVE TIMELY POP CONTROL AND CARE; 2) DEVELOP VALID DEEP LEARNING BASED SEMI-PARAMETRIC METHODS TO IDENTIFY TRUE CAUSAL FACTORS AND MECHANISMS OF POP TO DESIGN MORE EFFECTIVE POP MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS; AND 3) BUILD POWERFUL MODELS TO CONDUCT ROBUST HIDDEN SUBGROUP ANALYSIS TO DEVELOP THE OPTIMAL POP MANAGEMENT TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT'S NEEDS. METHODS DEVELOPED IN AIMS 1 3 ARE MOTIVATED AND WILL BE TESTED BY TWO UNIQUE DATA: A LARGE EHR DATA FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL'S CAROLINA DATA WAREHOUSE FOR HEALTH (CDW-H), AND A HIGH-QUALITY COHORT DATA FROM NIH- FUNDED TEMPORAL POSTOPERATIVE PAIN SIGNATURES STUDY, WHICH COMPLEMENTS THE CDW-H IN SCALE AND SCOPE.

UP TO 20% OF TRAUMATIC DEATHS MAY BE PREVENTABLE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT MISCOMMUNICATION (THAT LEADS TO ERRORS, TRAUMA TEAM CONFUSION AND SUBOPTIMAL CARE), IS THE LEADING ATTRIBUTABLE CAUSE OF DEATH DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF CARE. IN PART, THIS MISCOMMUNICATION STEMS FROM THE COMPLEX AND CHAOTIC NATURE OF THE TRAUMA RESUSCITATION ENVIRONMENT. WHILE THAT IS INHERENT IN THE CASES THAT TRAUMA TEAMS ADDRESS, THERE ARE FACETS OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD BE CHANGED TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND THE QUALITY OF PATIENT DATA CAPTURED. PRESENTLY, MANY TRAUMA CENTERS IN THE U. S. RELY ON TO RECORD DATA DURING TRAUMA RESUSCITATION. SINCE NURSE SCRIBES ARE CHARGED WITH DATA INPUTS, HUMAN ERROR FURTHER CONTRIBUTES TO DATA INACCURACIES OR OMISSIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE QUALITY OF MANAGING A TRAUMA CASE. DATA CAPTURE WITH PAPER IS ALSO DIFFICULT DUE TO THE SHEER VOLUME OF INFORMATION TRANSMITTED, THE FRAGMENTED NATURE OF THE INFORMATION PRESENTED ON VARIOUS DISPLAYS, AND THE FACT THAT INFORMATION DOES NOT FLOW CONCURRENTLY TO THE TREATMENT TEAM. UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) DO NOT SUPPORT RAPID INPUT OF DATA, AND IN FACT, ARE KNOWN TO SLOW MANY PROCESSES. FURTHERMORE, NONE OF THE CURRENT METHODS USED TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FRONT LINE STAFF WORKFLOW NOR PROVIDE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE ELECTRONIC PLATFORM COUPLED TO A SITUATION AWARENESS MONITOR THAT INTEGRATES SEAMLESSLY INTO CURRENT RESUSCITATION WORKFLOWS. WE HAVE ALREADY CONDUCTED USABILITY TESTING WITH TRAUMA STAFF IN EARLIER WORK, WHERE WE ESTABLISHED WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY OF ALL SYSTEM COMPONENTS, DEMONSTRATED USER ACCEPTANCE OF THE INTERFACE DESIGNS FOR RAPID DATA INPUT BY SCRIBE NURSES AND VALIDATED INTEGRITY OF DATA OUTPUTS FROM THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS MONITOR (SAM). THE GOAL OF THIS PHASE II PROJECT IS TO INTEGRATE THIS STANDALONE PRODUCT INTO A COMMONLY USED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD PLATFORM TO OPTIMIZE SECURITY, DATA SHARING AND EASIER ADOPTION OF THE PLATFORM. WE WILL RIGOROUSLY TEST THE SYSTEM FOR PROPER INTEGRATION, ASSIMILATION INTO NURSING WORKFLOW AND USABILITY. TESTING WILL BE CONDUCTED USING SIMULATED TRAUMA RESUSCITATIONS AND REAL TRAUMAS.

ADDITIONALLY, INCREASING EFFICIENCY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT, AN IMPORTANT IMPLICATION FOR ALL HOSPITALS. THEREFORE, AUTOMATION OF MANUAL DOCUMENTATION AND TASK COORDINATION CAN ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY, SAFETY, AND PROFITABILITY, AS WELL AS JOB SATISFACTION FOR CLINICIANS.  THE WHITEBOARD COORDINATOR (WC) PLATFORM SOLVES THESE MARKET CHALLENGES THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) DRIVEN OR WORKFLOWS AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. THE PLATFORM IS DEPLOYED ON A VIRTUAL SERVER WITHIN A HOSPITAL\u2019S LOCAL NETWORK. IT COMMUNICATES WITH THE EXISTING ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR) TO IMPORT THE DAY\u2019S SURGERY SCHEDULE AND ASSIGNED RESOURCES. ONCE OR WORKFLOW BEGINS, AN INTELLIGENT NETWORK OF SENSORS AND CAMERAS EMPLOYING MACHINE VISION ALGORITHMS RECORD LOCATIONS AND TIMES OF PATIENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES. AS CLINICAL ACTIVITIES BEGIN, THE SOFTWARE AUTOMATICALLY ALERTS ALL STAKEHOLDERS OF IMPORTANT EVENTS VIA TEXT AND PAGING TO COORDINATE CLINICAL PROCESSES. INFORMATION IS ALSO DISSEMINATED ON DIGITAL DISPLAYS THROUGHOUT STAKEHOLDER LOCATIONS, SUCH AS THE OR, PREOPERATIVE HOLDING, POST ANESTHESIA CARE UNIT, STERILE SUPPLY, HIGH-TRAFFIC HALLWAYS, AND BREAK ROOMS.

FIRST, THE PHASE I PROTOTYPE PLATFORM WILL BE ENHANCED WITH NEW FEATURES TO FULLY SUPPORT USER WORKFLOW AND EFFICIENCY ACROSS ALL OR STAKEHOLDERS. TARGETED UPDATES WILL FOCUS ON CONNECTED DATA DOMAINS AND CROSS PLATFORM INTEGRATION, USER INTERFACE WORKFLOWS AND AUTOMATED REPORTS, AND VOICE COMMAND INTEGRATION. SECOND, THE AI SUITE WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY UPDATED WITH NOVEL TOOLS THAT BUILD UPON THE PHASE I FRAMEWORK INCLUDING DETECTION OF NOVEL SURGERY TYPES & EVENTS, DETECTION OF SURGICAL SUPPLIES & INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, AND A SIMULATION TOOLBOX FOR RESOURCE PLANNING.

ONE EXAMPLE APPLICATION DOMAIN IS ASTHMA CONTROL AND PREDICTION. IN USA ALONE, ABOUT 40 MILLION PEOPLE SUFFERED FROM LIFETIME ASTHMA (13% OF THE USA POPULATION) AND 26 MILLION PEOPLE (8%) SUFFERED FROM CURRENT ASTHMA. DEVELOPING BETTER PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR ASTHMA ATTACKS, CAN RESULT IN ENHANCING PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES, IMPROVING PATIENT OUTCOMES, AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING HEALTHCARE COSTS DUE TO REDUCED EMERGENCY CARE NEED. ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS OBSTRUCTING SUCH MODELS FOR HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT IS THE INTEGRATION OF PATIENT DATA THAT ARE SCATTERED ACROSS MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS. THIS FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOR CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS ASTHMA WHERE PATIENTS OFTEN RECEIVE CARE AT MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS WITHIN A REGION. FURTHERMORE, SINGLE SITE STUDIES MAY PROVIDE INACCURATE PICTURE DUE TO DATA INACCURACIES. FOR EXAMPLE, DUE TO CERTAIN SELECTION BIASES, NUMBER OF PATIENTS FROM CERTAIN RACE GROUP MAYBE UNDERREPRESENTED IN ONE LOCATION. IN ADDITION, SEVERITY INFORMATION OF DISEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE IF ALL THE EMERGENCY CARE VISITS ARE NOT RECORDED. WITHOUT PROPER RECORD LINKAGE AND DATA DUPLICATION, MANY OF THE DISEASE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS MAY BE OVER-REPRESENTED. FOR INSTANCE, IT IS REPORTED THAT AFTER CROSS-INSTITUTION DEDUPLICATION, NUMBER OF RECORDS RELATED TO DIABETES REDUCED 24.0%, ASTHMA REDUCED 28.0%, AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION REDUCED 10.9%. THEREFORE, IT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO MERGE RECORDS IN A MANNER THAT MITIGATES DUPLICATION, AS WELL AS FRAGMENTATION, OF AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES TO FACILITATE DATA INTEGRATION AND EXCHANGE, LINKING PATIENT RECORDS ACROSS MULTIPLE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS CREATE SIGNIFICANT SECURITY AND PRIVACY CHALLENGES. AT THE SAME TIME, AS THE USAGE OF HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS AND THE DATA SHARING INCREASES, PATIENT TRUST IN THE OVERALL DATA ANALYTICS PIPELINE MUST BE ENSURED BY ASKING PATIENTS TO MAKE A \u201cCONSENT DECISION\u201d. THIS CONSENT DECISION CONCERNS THE SHARING AND ACCESSING OF THE PATIENT\u2019S HEALTH DATA FOR TREATMENT, PAYMENT, AND HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS PURPOSES. AS A RESULT, OUR HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS RESEARCH NOWADAYS IS AT UTMOST NEED OF A PRODUCT THAT CAN MANAGE PATIENT CONSENT WHILE ALLOWING SECURE AND PRIVACY-PRESERVING LINKAGE OF HEALTH CARE DATA ACROSS MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE WILL DEVELOP A PRIVACY-PRESERVING SOLUTION THAT CAN 1) EFFICIENTLY CAPTURE CONSENT, USE THE CAPTURED CONSENT INFORMATION TO GATHER PATIENT DATA DISTRIBUTED ACROSS RESOURCES WITHIN A CERTAIN HEALTH ORGANIZATION EFFICIENTLY AND 2) LINK THE DATA HOSTED BY DIFFERENT USERS ACROSS DISPARATE HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS WHILE PROTECTING PATIENT PRIVACY AND PROVIDING ACCOUNTABILITY. ALTHOUGH THERE EXIST SOME SOLUTIONS FOR MANAGING HEALTHCARE CONSENT AND PRIVACY-PRESERVING RECORD LINKAGE, THEY ARE NOT INTEGRATED. IN ADDITION, EXISTING TECHNIQUES EITHER DO NOT EASILY SCALE FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA AND/OR LEAK SENSITIVE INFORMATION DURING RECORD LINKAGE PROCESS.

IMPROVEMENTS OF CDS. CDS ENHANCES HEALTH-RELATED DECISIONS AND ACTIONS WITH PERTINENT, ORGANIZED CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE, AND PATIENT INFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE, PHYSICIANS MAY HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING TO ORDER ALL GUIDELINE-RECOMMENDED CARE FOR SEPSIS. CDS DELIVERED VIA AN ORDER SET IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) CAN SIMPLIFY THIS PROCESS AND REDUCE MORTALITY BY BUNDLING THE RECOMMENDED DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC ORDERS TOGETHER. HOWEVER, CDS MAY FAIL TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES BECAUSE: (1) THE CDS TOOL IS UNDERUTILIZED; (2) THE USER MAY NOT FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDED ACTION FROM THE CDS; (3) THE RECOMMENDED ACTION MAY NOT LEAD TO THE APPROPRIATE EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE (EBP); AND/OR (4) THE EBP MAY NOT TRANSLATE TO THE EXPECTED OUTCOME IN A NOVEL POPULATION. HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS NEED AN EFFICIENT, RIGOROUS, AND SCALABLE PROCESS EVALUATION METHOD TO DIAGNOSE WHEN AND WHY CDS IS NOT LEADING TO THE INTENDED IMPROVEMENTS.

MINORITY STUDENTS ADMITTED TO STATISTICS OR BIOSTATISTICS GRADUATE PROGRAMS ARE CONFRONTED WITH LACK OF DIVERSITY AT THE FACULTY LEVEL, AND, FREQUENTLY, LACK OF AWARENESS BY FACULTY OF WAYS TO BEST SUPPORT THEM. EXPLANATIONS FOR THE LACK OF FACULTY DIVERSITY IN SCIENCE ARE MULTIFACTORIAL, BUT TWO KEY DRIVERS ARE THE LACK OF INCLUSION FREQUENTLY FELT BY RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY STUDENTS, AND THE PIPELINE PROBLEM REFLECTED BY THE LOW NUMBER OF DOCTORAL GRADUATES FROM THESE HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS. THE DRIVING OBJECTIVE OF SEATTLESTATSUMMER (SEATTLESTATSUMMER FOR BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH TRAINING) IS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY TACKLE THESE OBSTACLES. TO ADDRESS THE PIPELINE PROBLEM, WE WILL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A NEW SUMMER MENTORED RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR UNDERGRADUATES WHO IDENTIFY AS UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. THE PROGRAM WILL OFFER: (1) AN ENGAGING AND SUPPORTIVE MENTORED RESEARCH EXPERIENCE THAT INCREASES THEIR AWARENESS OF AND INTEREST IN PURSUING CAREERS IN STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH AND (2) CAREER DEVELOPMENT, COMMUNITY BUILDING, AND SOCIAL/EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. OUR GOAL IS THAT STUDENTS WILL NOT ONLY GAIN SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE IN STATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE, BUT THEY WILL FEEL A SENSE OF BELONGING AND RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE STATISTICS AND RESEARCH COMMUNITIES. THE PROGRAM WILL ALSO PROVIDE COACHING TO FACULTY MENTORS TO OPTIMIZE THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS AND CONFIDENCE IN MENTORING STUDENTS AND WILL ENGAGE FACULTY IN ACTIVITIES THAT BUILD COMMUNITY.

THIS UNDERACHIEVEMENT IS A KEY FACTOR IN DISSUADING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM CONSIDERING COLLEGE EDUCATION. HENCE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO PREPARE THE FUTURE RESEARCH WORKFORCE IN BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS. ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOHEALTH INFORMATICS (DBI) AT THE SCHOOL OF INFORMATICS AND COMPUTING (SOIC), INDIANA UNIVERSITY PURDUE UNIVERSITY INDIANAPOLIS (IUPUI) CAMPUS TO BE HOSTING THIS R25 EDUCATION PROGRAM IS THE RECENTLY APPROVED BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS (BMI) BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PROGRAM, WHICH IS THE ONLY SUCH PROGRAM IN INDIANA AND THE THIRD IN THE NATION, TO EDUCATE STUDENTS IN A RAPIDLY GROWING FIELD, TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF INFORMATICS-TRAINED RESEARCH WORKFORCE IN BIOMEDICINE. SINCE WE ALSO HAVE A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ACCELERATED BS+MS PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS STUDENTS TO COMPLETE BOTH A BACCALAUREATE AND MASTER\u2019S DEGREES IN FIVE YEARS, THE STUDENTS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DEGREE PATHWAY THAT WILL PREPARE THEM FOR HIGHER-PAYING JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIELDS OF BIOINFORMATICS AND HEALTH INFORMATICS.

THE LARGE VOLUMES OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION HAVE ALSO MADE IT VERY CHALLENGING FOR MODERN SEARCH ENGINES TO FIND RELEVANT ARTICLES ACCURATELY FOR A GIVEN QUERY. MISSING IMPORTANT PRIOR STUDIES IN LITERATURE SEARCH CAN HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS WASTING RESOURCES/TIME AND/OR MAKING WRONG SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS. ANOTHER UNMET CHALLENGE IN LITERATURE SEARCH IS THAT RESEARCHERS OFTEN PREFER FINDING ARTICLES WHERE THE QUERIES THEY USE ARE PART OF THE NEW DISCOVERIES, INSTEAD OF THE BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE IN THE ARTICLES. THE CURRENT SEARCH ENGINES CANNOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NEW DISCOVERIES AND BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE IN AN ARTICLE. RELATED TO THIS CHALLENGE IS THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY THE LATEST DISCOVERIES IN A PARTICULAR SCIENTIFIC AREA WITHOUT READING ALL THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED ARTICLES. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, ONE CAN CONVERT UNSTRUCTURED TEXT DATA INTO STRUCTURED FORM, WHICH CAN THEN SUPPORT HIGHLY ACCURATE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, INFORMATION INTEGRATION AND AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY. A PLAUSIBLE APPROACH FOR CONVERTING UNSTRUCTURED TEXT INTO STRUCTURED FORM IS TO USE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) AND RELATION EXTRACTION (RE) METHODS TO IDENTIFY THE BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES AND EXTRACT THEIR RELATIONS TO CONSTRUCT KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS (KGS). KGS CAN LINK CONCEPTS WITHIN EXISTING RESEARCH TO ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO FIND CONNECTIONS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER WITHOUT THEM.

FATIGUE-INDUCED ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE NEGATIVE FINANCIAL AND PATIENT/OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY IMPACT IN EDS AND OTHER SETTINGS. COMMONLY USED TIME- AND TASK-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES (E.G., MULTITASKING), ARE MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE IN CLINICIANS WITH FATIGUE. POTENTIAL CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES, AND FATIGUE-INDUCED ADVERSE EVENTS, HAVE BEEN STUDIED, HOWEVER INTERVENTIONS TO MITIGATE RISKS IS LIMITED. CURRENTLY PROPOSED SOLUTIONS TO OBVIATE FATIGUE (E.G., LIMIT WORKING HOURS, DECREASED PATIENT LOAD) CAN BE HELPFUL, BUT FATIGUE IS A COMPLEX CONSTRUCT, MAKING IT LESS FEASIBLE TO DEVELOP UNCOMPLICATED SOLUTIONS. DECADES OF ADAPTIVE AUTOMATION LITERATURE SUGGEST THAT CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS) SYSTEMS THAT CAN ADAPT TO IN-THE-MOMENT VARIATIONS IN CLINICIAN\u2019S FATIGUE, HAVE POTENTIAL TO INTERCEPT FATIGUE-INDUCED HUMAN ERRORS AND PRECLUDE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS. A CRITICISM OF CDS, IS THAT IT ONLY PROVIDES DECONTEXTUALIZED DECISION SUPPORT WHEN IT HAS POTENTIAL TO BE ADAPTED TO ITS USERS (I.E., FRONTLINE CLINICIANS). USERS WITH DIFFERENT FATIGUE LEVEL HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS. WHEN CDS SUPPORT IS DECONTEXTUALIZED, IT BECOMES PART OF THE BACKGROUND THAT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO CLINICIAN FATIGUE. CLINICIANS NOT WELCOMING CDS PROMPTS, DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO AVOID INTERACTING WITH THE CDS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. ADAPTIVE CDS WOULD CONFIGURE ITSELF BASED ON A CLINICIAN\u2019S FATIGUE LEVEL TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF INFORMATION, TO THE RIGHT USER, AT THE RIGHT TIME.

THE ECG IS CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC ARMAMENTARIUM OF IAS, BECAUSE IT IS INEXPENSIVE, PORTABLE, PROVIDES POINT-OF-CARE RESULTS AND DOES NOT REQUIRE HIGHLY SKILLED PERSONNEL TO PERFORM. HOWEVER, FROM THE STANDPOINT OF INTERPRETATION, THE ECG DOES NOT YIELD A SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC RESULT AND THEREFORE IT FAILS TO SERVE AS AN ACCURATE SCREENING OR DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR IAS. PART OF THIS INACCURACY DERIVES FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF TOO FEW INDIVIDUALS TO GENERATE THE NORMAL REFERENCE ECG VALUES, WITH MORE THAN 100 AGE AND GENDER-DEPENDENT VARIABLES AND CUT-OFF VALUES TO MEMORIZE, ALL RESULTING IN FOUNDATIONAL DEFICIENCIES AND A VERY HIGH INTER-OBSERVER INTERPRETATION VARIABILITY. WE HAVE CREATED A NOVEL ECG DATABASE FROM THE LARGEST HISTORICAL COHORT OF NORMAL INDIVIDUALS OF MORE THAN 27,000 SUBJECTS. WE THEN TRANSFORMED THE DATA OF 102 ECG VARIABLES TO EXPRESS THE VALUES AS Z-SCORES. Z- SCORES BY DEFINITION FACILITATE AN IMMEDIATE AND OBJECTIVE DISTINCTION OF NORMALITY AND ABNORMALITY ACROSS ALL MEASURES. EXPRESSING THE ECG VALUES IN Z-SCORES ELIMINATES INTER-OBSERVER VARIABILITY IN THE INTERPRETATION OF ECG VALUES.

CLINICIANS OFTEN OVERESTIMATE HOW FREQUENTLY A TEST SHOULD BE REPEATED, OR FOR CONVENIENCE THEY ORDER TESTS TO BE REPEATED EVERY DAY. THIS WASTES RESOURCES AND INCREASES THE COST OF CARE. SIMILARLY, IT CAN ALSO BE EASY TO UNDERESTIMATE HOW OFTEN A TEST SHOULD BE REPEATED, WHICH CAN LEAD TO SUBOPTIMAL CARE, WITH INCREASED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INTERVENTIONS ATTEMPTED OVER THE YEARS TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF REPEATED TESTS, BUT THEY GENERALLY USE SUBJECTIVE, EXPERT-SPECIED RULES THAT SET MINIMUM TESTING FREQUENCIES FOR CERTAIN CLINICAL SCENARIOS. THESE ATTEMPTS ARE LAUDABLE, BUT THEY ARE RATHER BLUNT INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ADAPT TO THE SPECIC AND VARYING NEEDS OF A PATIENT'S PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC STATE AND TREATMENT REGIMEN, AND THEY DON'T AFFECT TESTS THAT AREN'T BEING RUN FREQUENTLY ENOUGH.  THE KEY TO PROVIDING DATA-DRIVEN TIMING GUIDANCE IS THE ABILITY TO ESTIMATE FROM DATA THE RATE AT WHICH A SPECIC OBSERVED RESULT WILL GO STALE, MEANING THAT IT IS OLD ENOUGH THAT THE ESTIMATED CURRENT VALUE IS TOO UNCERTAIN TO BE USED FOR DECISION MAKING. THE MATHEMATICALLY OPTIMAL TIME TO ORDER A TEST REPEAT IS EXACTLY WHEN THE MOST RECENT VALUE REACHES THAT LEVEL OF UNDESIRABLE UNCERTAINTY. IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS, THE RATE AT WHICH THE LATEST VALUE OF A TEST GOES STALE CHANGES OVER TIME DUE TO MANY FACTORS, AND THEREFORE, SO DOES THE OPTIMAL TIME FOR THE NEXT TEST.

IN DOING SO, WE WILL USE PARTICIPATORY SYSTEM DYNAMICS (PSD) MODELING AS A MULTI-COMPONENT STRATEGY TO EVALUATE AND PLAN IMPLEMENTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS DURING THE EXPLORATION PHASE OF IMPLEMENTATION, WHEN DECISION-MAKING OCCURS, IN A WAY WHERE ML-ENABLED CDS CAN BE SUSTAINED OVER TIME. AS SUCH, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE UPSTREAM IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES OF ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, AND FEASIBILITY OF ML-ENABLED CDS. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROJECT IS THAT A PROCESS THAT ENGAGES DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS IN IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING EARLY ON WILL CLARIFY COMMITMENT TO IMPLEMENTATION AND POTENTIAL FOR ADOPTION BY REVEALING ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY, AND APPROPRIATENESS. FOR THIS PROJECT WE WILL FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR SET OF ML-ENABLED CDS: EARLY WARNING SCORES (EWSS), USED TO IDENTIFY DECOMPENSATING PATIENTS. WE PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE BY PURSUING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. ENGAGE MULTIDISCIPLINARY STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN EWS IMPLEMENTATION (USERS, DEVELOPERS, IMPLEMENTERS, OWNERS) FROM TWO SYSTEMATICALLY VARYING ADOPTION CONTEXTS TO CO-DEFINE COMMON BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO KEY IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES OF CDS ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, AND FEASIBILITY USING GROUP MODEL BUILDING SCRIPTS FROM THE FIELD OF SYSTEM DYNAMICS AND 2. EVALUATE THE PSD PROCESS BY MEASURING CHANGE IN COMMITMENT TO ADOPT CDS (USING MEASURES OF ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, AND FEASIBILITY), ELICITING FEEDBACK, AND ESTIMATING INTERVENTION EFFORT. WE WILL OBTAIN DATA VIA A SERIES OF GROUP MODELING SESSIONS FROM STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE USED CDS IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, WHERE ALERTS VARY BY TARGET USER, TIME, AND FREQUENCY AMONG OTHER FACTORS. WE WILL EMPLOY WELL-DEFINED SCRIPTS FROM THE FIELD OF SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODELING TO FACILITATE GROUP DISCUSSION TOWARD DEVELOPING A SHARED THEORY ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF ML-ENABLED CDS RESPONSE (AIM 1). BECAUSE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY STRATEGY REQUIRES ADAPTATION, WE WILL EVALUATE THE PSD PROCESS (AIM 2) TO REFINE AND PREPARE FOR USE ELSEWHERE. THIS CONTRIBUTION IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE EWSS ARE WIDELY USED ACROSS BOTH ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY HOSPITALS. THIS CONTRIBUTION IS INNOVATIVE BY USING GROUP MODELING TECHNIQUES FOR THE PROBLEM OF ML-ENABLED CDS IMPLEMENTATION, CREATING BOTH METHODOLOGICAL AND SUBSTANTIVE FINDINGS.

WHILE PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH PRODUCES HIGHER-QUALITY EVIDENCE, RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES THAT REUSE CLINICAL DATA CAN BE EXECUTED IN A SHORTER TIME FRAME AND FOR LESS COST, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CRUCIAL FOR RESEARCH IN A PANDEMIC. UNFORTUNATELY, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE USEFULNESS AND VALIDITY OF AVAILABLE COVID-19 DATA ARE CONSTRAINED BY VARIOUS FORMS OF SELECTION BIAS AND INFORMATION BIAS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO NON-VALID FINDINGS IN RESEARCH AND ANALYTICS AND DISPARITIES IN RESULTING HEALTHCARE PRACTICES.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO STUDY THE SELECTION AND INFORMATION BIASES PRESENT IN CLINICALLY DERIVED COVID-19 DATASETS BY INTEGRATING COVID-19 DATASETS FROM OHSU AND THE NATIONAL COVID COHORT COLLABORATIVE WITH NOVEL AND TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF CLINICAL, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND CITIZEN-GENERATED DATA. FROM EACH DATA SOURCE WE WILL EXTRACT DATA INDICATING COVID-19, AS WELL AS A SET OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AND ACCESS. TO TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF SELECTION BIAS, WE WILL CONSTRUCT AND COMPARE CATEGORICAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS FOR EACH SOCIAL DETERMINANT ACROSS COVID-19 CASES IN EACH DATA SOURCE. DIFFERENCES IN THESE DISTRIBUTIONS WILL INDICATE SELECTION BIAS IN ONE OR MORE OF THE DATA SOURCES. NEXT WE WILL DETERMINE INFORMATION BIAS BY EXTENDING AND ADAPTING TESTS FOR MISSINGNESS AND OTHER FORMS OF INFORMATION BIAS IN THE COVID-19 DATASETS TO DETERMINE IF THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THESE DATA VARY WITH RESPECT TO CLINICAL FACTORS AND THOSE RELATED TO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

NONETHELESS, HOW THIS DEBATE CHANGES AND IMPACTS THE UPTAKE RATES FOR CRUCIAL VACCINES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC REMAINS UNKNOWN. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF MISINFORMATION ON DIGITAL PLATFORMS THAT THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF THIS APPLICATION ARE TO DEVELOP A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE VACCINE INFORMATICS SYSTEM TO TRACK VACCINE DEBATE, AND TO TEST THE IMPACT OF VACCINE DEBATE ON COVID-19 (IF DEVELOPED BY 2021), FLU, AND HPV IMMUNIZATION RATES DURING THE ONSET OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT VACCINE DEBATE WILL INCREASE AND BECOME MORE NEGATIVE DURING THE PANDEMIC, LEADING TO LOWER VACCINE UPTAKE RATES. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROJECT IS THAT DISCOVERING HOW VACCINE DEBATE CHANGES AND INFLUENCES VACCINE UPTAKE RATES DURING A PANDEMIC WILL BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR MANAGING AND PREVENTING DISEASE SPREAD. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY PURSUING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DEVELOP A VACCINE INFORMATICS SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY THE FREQUENCY AND VALENCE OF VACCINE DEBATE DURING AND FOLLOWING THE PANDEMIC COMPARED TO THE PRE-PANDEMIC BASELINE; AND 2) APPLY THIS SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL IMPACT OF VACCINE DEBATE ON IMMUNIZATION RATES DURING THE PANDEMIC. UNDER THE FIRST AIM, ~1 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS WILL BE COLLECTED, AND A DEEP-LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR CLASSIFYING MULTIMODAL SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS WILL BE DEVELOPED. THIS ALGORITHM WILL ADDRESS POTENTIAL BIAS AND NOISE IN HUMAN ANNOTATIONS OF VACCINE DEBATE THAT IS INCREASINGLY POLITICIZED. THE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS WILL BE TABULATED IN A WEB PORTAL SO THAT DAILY AND WEEKLY STATISTICS ABOUT PRO- AND ANTI-VACCINE POSTS WILL BE READILY AVAILABLE. UNDER THE SECOND AIM, A MULTIMETHOD APPROACH WILL BE PROPOSED THAT RESOLVES THE CURRENT BARRIERS IN RESEARCH ON VACCINE REFUSAL. THIS APPROACH WILL USE A SURVEY OF 2,000 INDIVIDUALS WHO REPRESENT THE US POPULATION. THE SURVEY RESPONSES WILL BE COMBINED WITH THE RESPONDENTS' PRIOR ENGAGEMENT WITH VACCINE DEBATE RETROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. THESE ENGAGEMENT DATA WILL BE THEN CLASSIFIED BY THE MACHINE- LEARNING ALGORITHM DEVELOPED IN AIM 1. THIS RESEARCH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT PROPOSES A ROBUST CO-TEACHING FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING NOISY HUMAN ANNOTATIONS OF VACCINE DEBATE. IT ALSO PROPOSES A STATISTICAL MODELING TECHNIQUE THAT INVOLVES HETEROGENOUS METRICS OBTAINED FROM A MULTI-METHOD APPROACH FOR HYPOTHESIS TESTING. THESE INNOVATIONS ARE TIMELY AND URGENT AS THE CURRENT TIME PRESENTS A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF VACCINE DEBATE ON PUBLIC HEALTH DURING THE ONSET OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

HOWEVER, THEY HAVE BROUGHT WITH THEM A NUMBER OF BURDENS \u2013 SOME EXPECTED AND OTHERS UNANTICIPATED. THE MEDICAL LITERATURE IS REPLETE WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT INFORMATION IN PATIENT RECORDS IS DIFFICULT TO FIND, PARTLY DUE TO ITS ABSENCE AND PARTLY DUE TO ITS OBFUSCATION BY A PROLIFERATION OF LOW-VALUE DATA IN WHAT IS CALLED \u201cNOTE BLOAT\u201d. OTHER COMPLAINTS FOCUS ON CLINICAL ALERTING APPLICATIONS, WHICH HAVE PROVEN TO ISSUE VASTLY MORE FALSE ALARMS THAN TRUE ONES, LEADING TO ALERT FATIGUE WHICH RESULTS IN CLINICIANS MISSING THE IMPORTANT WARNINGS.

EXTENSIVE EFFORT TO DATA HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN RESOLVING THESE COMPLAINTS ABOUT EHRS. THE PREMISE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS THAT THERE IS INFORMATION ABOUT THE CLINICIANS\u2019 THINKING THAT IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE OR IS MISSING FROM THE EHR AND THAT IF IT CAN BE ADDED IN A STRUCTURED, COMPUTABLE WAY EHR IMPROVEMENTS CAN FOLLOW. WE REFER TO THAT INFORMATION AS THE \u201cWHY\u201d OF HEALTH CARE: WHY DOES THE CLINICIAN THINK THE PATIENT HAS A SIGN OR SYMPTOM, WHY IS A PARTICULAR TEST OR TREATMENT BEING CHOSEN, WHY IS A TREATMENT BEING DISCONTINUED. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL EXPLORE WAY TO REPRESENT PATIENT DATA WITH THIS ADDED KNOWLEDGE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MUST BE ADDED TO THE EHR, HOW THE ADDITION MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED, AND HOW THE RESULTING KNOWLEDGE BASE MIGHT BE USED. AS A FIRST STEP IN USAGE, WE WILL EXPLORE A KNOWLEDGE- BASED METHOD FOR IMPROVING THE NAVIGATION OF PATIENT DATA IN AN EHR. THE PROJECT WILL INVOLVE THREE SEQUENTIAL STEPS. FIRST, WE DEVELOP METHODS TO BREAK DOWN THE INFORMATION IN A PATIENT RECORD, INCLUDING INFORMATION FROM NARRATIVE TEXT (NOTES), INTO INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL ENTITIES (SUCH AS PROBLEMS, TESTS AND MEDICATIONS) TO CREATE PATIENT DATA SETS (PDSS). NEXT, WE WILL BUILD ON OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF THE CONCEPTS OF THE CLINICAL CARE CONTEXT (PATIENT FINDINGS AND CONDITIONS, DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND THEIR RESULTS, AND THERAPEUTIC PLANS) TO ADD RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE ENTITIES THAT CONVEY THE CLINICAL REASONING BEHIND THEM (SUCH AS LINKING A PROBLEM TO SET OF POSSIBLE CAUSES, A TEST INTENDED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE CAUSES, AND A TREATMENT CHOSEN ON THE BASIS OF A TEST RESULT) TO CREATE PATIENT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE BASES (PSKBS). FINALLY, WE WILL EXPLORE THE PRACTICALITY OF CREATING PKSBS AND THEIR USABILITY BY CREATING PDSS AND PKSBS FOR ACTUAL PATIENTS BEING SEEN BY MEDICAL RESIDENTS IN CLINIC AND PROVIDING THE RESIDENTS WITH A NAVIGATIONAL TOOL THAT MAKES USE OF THE KNOWLEDGE BASE TO HELP THEM BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR PATIENTS\u2019 CASES.

DATA: AN AUTOMATED APPROACH FOR IDENTIFYING REPRESENTATIVE HEARTBEATS IN THE CLINICAL SETTING - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT WITH A CONSTANT STREAM OF PATIENT DATA GENERATED AT THE HOSPITAL BEDSIDE, CLINICIANS ARE ASKED TO INTERPRET THIS DATA ALONG WITH PATIENT MEDICAL RECORDS AND LAB RESULTS IN REAL TIME. THE PROPOSED PROJECT OFFERS AN APPROACH TO AUTOMATED CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS) IN PARSING THROUGH SOME OF THIS ABUNDANT DATA, FOCUSING ON THE TIME SERIES SUMMARIZATION (TSS) OF THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) AND APPROXIMATIONS TO THE RELATED VECTORCARDIOGRAM (VCG) USING TECHNIQUES AT THE INTERFACE OF DATA SCIENCE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT BEDSIDE MONITOR SIGNALS CAN BE CORRUPTED BY NOISE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NOISE/ARTIFACT, CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA, AND NORMAL CARDIAC RHYTHMS; WHILE THE LITERATURE APPROACHING SUCH ISSUES IS GROWING, THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM FOR THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION \u2013 ESPECIALLY FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES AS SEEN IN THE CARDIAC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (CICU). THROUGH COLLABORATION BETWEEN INVESTIGATORS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL OKLAHOMA (UCO) AND AT BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE AND TEXAS CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITAL (TCH), THIS PROJECT COMBINES THE APPLICATION OF DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND SUBSET SELECTION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS THE DISCRETE EMPIRICAL INTERPOLATION METHOD (DEIM) TO CLASSIFY AND SUMMARIZE DATA RECORDED FROM THE PEDIATRIC CICU AT TCH. SPECIFICALLY, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TWO-FOLD: (1) APPLY VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODERS (VAES) TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NOISE, ARRHYTHMIAS, AND NORMAL SINUS RHYTHM, AND (2) EVALUATE BOTH EXISTING AND NEWLY DEVELOPED SUBSET SELECTION ALGORITHMS, WITH AN ADDED EMPHASIS ON DEIM-RELATED METHODS IN APPLICATION TO CARDIAC DATA. UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT UCO WILL EVALUATE VAE ARCHITECTURES FOR NOISE DETECTION, PERFORMING MODEL SELECTION AND THEN APPLYING THE CHOSEN MODEL TO PATIENT DATA FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. ADDITIONAL VAE MODELS WILL BE TRAINED AND SELECTED FOR RECOGNIZING ECG AND VCG WAVEFORMS CONTAINING PATHOLOGIES. VAE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED TO THOSE GENERATED USING EXISTING METHODS IN THE LITERATURE AND WILL INFORM THE SUBSEQUENT SUMMARIZATION OF PATIENT DATA. WHILE DEIM HAS DEMONSTRATED VIABILITY IN CLASS- IDENTIFICATION TASKS IN PRIOR WORK, DEIM AND ITS RELATED METHODS WERE ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MATHEMATICAL MODEL REDUCTION, NOT CLASS IDENTIFICATION. FOR THIS REASON, STUDENTS WILL PERFORM A NECESSARY COMPARISON OF DEIM-RELATED METHODS APPLIED TO A VARIETY OF DATA TYPES, GIVING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING ECG WAVEFORMS; WHILE DOING SO, STUDENTS WILL ALSO DEVELOP A NOVEL EXTENSION OF SUCH METHODS TAILORED TO THIS SPECIFIC MEDICAL CONTEXT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPARISON OF THESE TECHNIQUES FOR CLASS IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES WILL OFFER VALUABLE INSIGHT REGARDING DEIM-RELATED METHODS TO BOTH THE LARGER BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DATA SCIENCE COMMUNITIES. ONCE ESTABLISHED, THIS TSS FRAMEWORK WILL PROVIDE A MEANS OF PRESENTING TO CLINICIANS A REPRESENTATION OF A PATIENT\u2019S RECENT CARDIAC HEALTH HISTORY, INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED AS-IS AND AS INPUT TO OTHER PREDICTIVE MODELS.

SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE MADE IT NECESSARY TO RELY ON DECISION-MAKING RULESETS THAT ARE SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD ENOUGH FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO EXECUTE QUICKLY WHILE PROVIDING URGENTLY NEEDED PATIENT CARE. TO DATE, PUBLISHED TRIAGE STUDIES HAVE NOT ACHIEVED THE GOALS FOR TRAUMA TRIAGE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE DESPITE EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE THE TRAUMA TRIAGE PROCESS. CURRENT TRIAGE SYSTEMS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. OUR PRIOR WORK DEMONSTRATED THAT ALLOWING MORE COMPLEX RULES WITH MORE DETAILED DATA CAN ACHIEVE A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD THOSE GOALS. OUR LONG-TERM AIM IS TO BUILD AN INTELLIGENT, LEARNING COMPUTERIZED TRAUMA TRIAGE DECISION SUPPORT (CTDS) SYSTEM, THAT, AIDED BY AN INFORMATION-RICH ENVIRONMENT, COLLECTS AND PROCESSES PREHOSPITAL DATA AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATES ACCURATE AND UNDERSTANDABLE TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. THE PROPOSED STEP TOWARD THIS GOAL WILL VALIDATE AND EXTEND OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND ASSESS THE COMPLEXITY OF AI-GENERATED EXPLANATIONS INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF SUCH A CTDS SYSTEM. WE PROPOSE USING A LARGE DEMOGRAPHICALLY AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE DATA SET TO FIRST BUILD AND QUANTITATIVELY ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF MULTIPLE COMPLEX MODELS. WE PROPOSE TO THEN ASSESS THE GROUP FAIRNESS OF THESE COMPLEX MODELS AND EVALUATE MULTIPLE BIAS MITIGATION STRATEGIES, AND LASTLY, WE PROPOSE WORKING WITH PARAMEDICS TO BOTH DESIGN ALGORITHMICALLY GENERATED, EMS-ORIENTED EXPLANATIONS AND ASSESS THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THOSE EXPLANATIONS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS INNOVATIVE, FIRST, BECAUSE IT EMBRACES THE COMPLEXITY THAT APPEARS TO BE REQUIRED TO APPROACH PUBLISHED ACCURACY GOALS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ASSESSING PRACTICAL TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COMPLEXITY. SECOND, IT WILL HELP DEFINE A PATH FORWARD FOR TRAUMA TRIAGE BY ADDRESSING OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES THAT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES (E.G., LOW-COST, INTERNET-CONNECTED SENSORS) CREATE FOR PREHOSPITAL DECISION MAKING. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF MISTRIAGED PATIENTS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COST-SAVINGS AND MORTALITY REDUCTION, BUT CURRENT TRIAGE SYSTEMS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY GOALS OR EVEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CURRENT MISTRIAGE RATES. IMPROVING ACCURACY THROUGH COMPLEX MODELS, HOWEVER, MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH TO RESULT IN THE IMPACTFUL CHANGE WE ENVISION.

FOR INSTANCE, INFECTIOUS DISEASE TRANSMISSION IN CROWDED AREAS, SUCH AS THE 2016 MEASLES OUTBREAK IN DISNEY WORLD THAT RESULTED IN 125 CASES, IS AFFECTED BY THE EVOLUTION OF THE PEDESTRIAN CONTACT NETWORK. IN SUCH CONTEXTS, MATHEMATICAL MODELS CAN BE USED TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT \u201cWHAT IF\u201d SCENARIOS FOR PLANNING PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, PEDESTRIAN MOBILITY MODELS COULD HELP IN THE DESIGN OF PUBLIC SPACES AND POLICIES THAT REDUCE CONTACTS TO MITIGATE DISEASE SPREAD OR ENCOURAGE WALKING TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, CONVENTIONAL MODELS EITHER IGNORE HUMAN MOVEMENT OR RELY ON COARSE-SCALE FEATURES OF HUMAN MOVEMENT, WHICH LIMITS THE TYPES OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE ATTEMPTED. UNDERSTANDING THE FINE-SCALE MOVEMENT AND INTERACTION PATTERNS OF PEOPLE CAN HELP DESIGN EFFECTIVE POLICIES AND SPATIAL LAYOUTS TO BETTER ENGINEER SUITABLE MOVEMENT AND INTERACTION PATTERNS FOR IMPROVED PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES IN SEVERAL DOMAINS.  PARTICLE DYNAMICS PROVIDES A MODELING METHODOLOGY TO STUDY MOVEMENT AND INTERACTIONS FROM THE CELLULAR TO THE POPULATION LEVEL. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO CREATE A DATA-DRIVEN COMPUTATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PARTICLE DYNAMICS, TARGETING PUBLIC HEALTH APPLICATIONS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE AN APPLICATION-AGNOSTIC PEDESTRIAN DYNAMICS MODEL, WHICH CONSIDERS EACH HUMAN TO BE A PARTICLE. HERE, WE WILL SIMULATE THE FINE-SCALED MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE IN SEVERAL CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH CONTEXTS.

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL APPLY NOVEL DATA SOURCES, SUCH AS LOCATION-BASED SERVICES (FROM CELL PHONE APPS) TO AUGMENT SUCH MODELS.  OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT COMBINING LOCATION-BASED SERVICE (LBS) DATA WITH PEDESTRIAN DYNAMICS MODELING CAN UNCOVER MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF PEOPLE IN COMPLEX SITUATIONS WITH MANY PUBLIC HEALTH APPLICATIONS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL DEVELOP AN APPLICATION-AGNOSTIC PEDESTRIAN DYNAMICS MODELING FRAMEWORK THAT ASSIMILATES LBS DATA.

AND SPECIALIST VISITS CONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF OUTPATIENT VISITS. EVEN THOUGH ALL PHYSICIANS HIGHLY VALUE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS (PCPS) AND SPECIALISTS, BOTH PCPS AND SPECIALISTS CITE THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TRANSFER AS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN THE REFERRAL PROCESS. THEREFORE, IT IS CRITICAL TO INVESTIGATE A NEW METHOD TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION DURING CARE TRANSITIONS. WITH THEIR UBIQUITOUS USE, IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) SHOULD ENSURE A SEAMLESS FLOW OF INFORMATION ACROSS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE THE REFERRAL PROCESS. BUT, A LACK OF ACCESSIBLE AND RELEVANT INFORMATION IN THE REFERRAL PROCESS REMAINS A PRESSING PROBLEM. RECENTLY, EMERGING DEEP LEARNING (DL) AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) METHODS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED IN EXTRACTING PERTINENT INFORMATION FROM EHRS AND GENERATING TEXT SUMMARIZATION TO IMPROVE CARE QUALITY AND PATIENT OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES CANNOT BE APPLIED TO PROCESS HETEROGENEOUS DATA FROM EHRS AND CREATE HIGH-QUALITY CLINICAL SUMMARIES FOR COMMUNICATING A REASON FOR REFERRAL. RESPONDING TO PA-20-185, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A NOVEL INFORMATICS FRAMEWORK TO COLLECT AND SYNTHESIZE LONGITUDINAL, MULTIMODAL EHR DATA FOR AUTOMATIC REFERRAL FORM GENERATION AND SUMMARIZATION. WHILE THE REFERRING PROVIDER AND SPECIALIST CAN BE ANY TYPE OF PROVIDER FOR ANY CONDITION, THE FOCUS IN THIS APPLICATION HAS BEEN ON HEADACHE FOR PRIMARY CARE, BECAUSE IT IS AN EXTREMELY COMMON SYMPTOM AND AFFECTS PEOPLE OF ALL AGES, RACES, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUSES. MORE IMPORTANTLY, RELEVANT INFORMATION NEEDED FOR HEADACHE REFERRALS HAS BEEN DEFINED IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE GUIDELINES. THEREFORE, A HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION TO MAKE THESE DATA ACCESSIBLE WILL EMPOWER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PCPS AND SPECIALISTS, WHICH CAN IMPROVE THE CARE OF MILLIONS OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM DISABLING HEADACHE DISORDERS. BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA AND OUR EXPERIENCE WITH AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF DATA SCIENTISTS AND PHYSICIANS, WE PLAN TO EXECUTE SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) CONVERT TEXT-BASED GUIDELINES INTO A STANDARDS-BASED ALGORITHM FOR ELECTRONIC IMPLEMENTATION; 2) DEVELOP MODELS TO AUTOMATICALLY POPULATE DATA FROM EHR AND CLINICAL NOTES TO FILL THE REFERRAL FORM; 3) CREATE A FRAMEWORK TO SUMMARIZE THE LONGITUDINAL CLINICAL NOTES TO FILL OUT THE REFERRAL FORM; AND 4) DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE HEADACHE REFERRAL SYSTEM WITH A USER-CENTERED DESIGN APPROACH. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED IN THIS PROJECT IS NOVEL AND INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT WILL PRODUCE AND RIGOROUSLY TEST NEW SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HEALTH PROFESSONALS TO ENSURE THAT SAFE, HIGH-QUALITY CARE IS PROVIDED AND CARE CONTINUITY IS MAINTAINED.

ALTHOUGH NLM HAS RECENTLY EMPLOYED AUTOMATIC MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO INDEX ARTICLES ACCORDING TO THE MAJOR TOPICS DISCUSSED, THERE IS STILL NO AUTOMATIC MEANS OF INDEXING EACH ARTICLE ACROSS ALL PUBLICATION TYPES AND STUDY DESIGNS.

ANALOGOUS TO AN ORGAN ALLOCATION SYSTEM, THESE ALGORITHMS CONVERT ETHICAL PRINCIPLES INTO A CONCRETE RANK ORDERING OF CANDIDATES FOR INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU) TREATMENTS WITH LIFE SUPPORT ALLOCATION SCORES. DISASTERS THAT PRODUCE SCARCITY TEND TO FALL HARDEST ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS. WHEN DESIGNING ALGORITHMS TO ALLOCATE SCARCE LIFE SUPPORT, PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS SHOULD TAKE THIS CONTEXT INTO ACCOUNT.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THE CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD OF BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT, MOST US STATES WOULD PRIORITIZE THOSE WITH LOW SEQUENTIAL ORGAN FAILURE ASSESSMENT (SOFA) SCORES. BUT SOFA WAS DESIGNED FOR PATIENTS ALREADY ON LIFE SUPPORT IN THE ICU, USING ROUTINELY MEASURED LABORATORY VALUES, DRUG DOSES, AND VITAL SIGNS TO MONITOR RESPONSE TO TREATMENT. MOST PATIENTS HAVE LOW SOFA SCORES WHEN CRITICAL ILLNESS IS FIRST RECOGNIZED, AND SOFA CANNOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE RISK OF DEATH USING DATA BEFORE LIFE SUPPORT WAS ALLOCATED. WE DEMONSTRATED HOW THE POOR PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE OF SOFA-BASED TRIAGE PROTOCOLS IS PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY UNDERPREDICTING THE SURVIVAL OF BLACK PATIENTS DUE TO A MISCALIBRATED RENAL COMPONENT OF THE SOFA SCORE. THERE IS A CLEAR NEED TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A NOVEL LIFE SUPPORT ALLOCATION PROTOCOL DESIGNED TO DEBIAS EXISTING SCORES AND SAVE MORE LIVES. PLACE-BASED DISADVANTAGE INDICES, SUCH AS THE AREA DEPRIVATION INDEX (ADI) AND THE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX, OFFER A POTENTIAL SOLUTION. USING THESE VALIDATED GEOGRAPHICAL MEASURES OF NEIGHBORHOOD DEPRIVATION TO ALLOCATE SCARCE HEALTHCARE RESOURCES COUNTERACTS THE RISK-INCREASING EFFECTS OF SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE, INCLUDING DISADVANTAGE PRODUCED BY RACIALIZED RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A WELL-DESIGNED LIFE SUPPORT ALLOCATION SCORE USING PLACE-BASED DISADVANTAGE INDICES CAN SAVE MORE LIVES AND MITIGATE HEALTHCARE INEQUITY IN A CRISIS.  THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A LIFE SUPPORT ALLOCATION ALGORITHM THAT ACCURATELY AND EQUITABLY ALLOCATES SCARCE ICU TREATMENTS IN A CRISIS.

CURRENTLY, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH TTS ENGAGE WITH INFORMATION ACROSS THE TRANSLATIONAL SPECTRUM. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT TTS USE A CONSTELLATION OF INFORMATION STRATEGIES, PROCESSES, AND TOOLS SIMULTANEOUSLY AND, OFTEN, HAPHAZARDLY, TO MANAGE THE INFORMATION OF CTR. THIS HAPHAZARD APPROACH TO INFORMATION MANAGEMENT LEADS TO LOST OR MISPLACED INFORMATION, INACCURATE RECORDS, AND DELAYS IN EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HEALTH.

FURTHERMORE, GIVEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND INCREASING VARIABILITY IN DAILY ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS, IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THESE GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS ON ASTHMA FOR BETTER CONTROL OF ASTHMA SYMPTOMS. GENE- ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF RISK FOR ASTHMA, BUT THE EXACT NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS AND THE MOLECULAR SIGNALS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INTERACTIONS REMAIN UNCLEAR. GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION STUDIES HAVE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON EXPOSURE TO PETS, MOLD, SMOKING, OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE, AIR POLLUTION, AND OTHER ALLERGENS. NONE OF THE STUDIES HAVE CONSIDERED CHANGES IN ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS IN THE ANALYSIS, LEAVING A KNOWLEDGE GAP ON THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND GENE AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO PHENOTYPES OF ASTHMA SEVERITY AND ACTIVITY. TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, WE WILL EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS COLLECTED FROM THE NEAREST OBSERVATORY AND GENOME-WIDE CELL TYPE-SPECIFIC GENE EXPRESSION LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA AS WELL AS ITS CONTRIBUTION TO ASTHMA SEVERITY AND ACTIVITY.

MOTIVATED BY THE PI\u2019S BROAD MICROBIOME COLLABORATIONS AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LANGONE HEALTH AND BUILDING UPON OUR EXTENSIVE AND RICH EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING NOVEL METHODS TO ANALYZE EMERGING OMICS DATA, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP TWO SETS OF NOVEL ANALYTIC METHODS TO ADDRESS TWO COMPUTATIONAL AND ANALYTICAL CHALLENGES IN PUSHING MICROBIOME RESEARCH TO REACH ITS FULL CLINICAL POTENTIAL. IN AIM 1, WE WILL TAKE A GRANULAR APPROACH TO DIVE INTO THE RAW METAGENOMICS SEQUENCING DATA AND INVESTIGATE HOW TO ANALYTICALLY DETECT AND DIFFERENTIATE CLOSELY RELATED MICROBIAL STRAINS WITHIN SPECIES.

DEEP LEARNING MODELS IN GENERAL REQUIRE LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING DATA, SPURRING INITIATIVES TO AGGREGATE MEDICAL DATA FROM ACROSS INSTITUTIONAL SILOES.

THE PROJECT ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE IN NEURORADIOLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY: HOW TO ACCURATELY DIAGNOSE CVDS ON COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY (CTA). CVDS INCLUDE INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS, STROKE, INTRACRANIAL VASCULAR STENOSIS, DURAL FISTULA, AND OTHER DISORDERS OF THE BRAIN VASCULATURE, AND THESE DISEASES HAVE SEVERE OUTCOMES AS THEY CAUSE HEMORRHAGE, STROKE, NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE, AND DEATH. IN FACT, EACH YEAR, CVDS CAUSE MORE THAN 100,000 DEATHS IN THE US, AND AN EVEN LARGER POPULATION SUFFERS PERMANENT DAMAGE, INCLUDING STROKE, PARALYSIS, AND LOSS OF SPEECH. IF WE CAN DIAGNOSE CVDS MORE ACCURATELY AND PROMPTLY, MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED.  BRAIN IMAGING IS A FIRST LINE DIAGNOSTIC FOR CVDS WITH THE IMAGE HALLMARKS BEING BRAIN BLOOD VESSEL ABNORMALITIES.

BECAUSE SOMATIC MUTATIONS ARISE IN THE BACKGROUND OF AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S GERMLINE GENOME, PRE-EXISTING GERMLINE VARIANTS MAY INFLUENCE WHICH SYNERGISTIC SOMATIC MUTATIONS ARE NEEDED TO DRIVE TUMORIGENESIS.

HOWEVER, AS CURRENT STUDIES MOSTLY EXAMINE GERMLINE AND SOMATIC VARIANTS INDEPENDENTLY, OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GERMLINE-SOMATIC INTERPLAYS (GXS) IS VERY LIMITED.  TO ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP AND TO FACILITATE PRECISION ONCOLOGY, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK, VARIANTS INTERACTING IN GERMLINE AND SOMA (VIGAS) THAT JOINTLY ASSESS THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACT OF THESE TWO GROUPS OF VARIANTS.

THUS, NEW METHODS ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS CURRENT GAPS. WE PROPOSE DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING AN ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER TO DISTINGUISH NON-WEAR TIME. WE WILL ADAPT AND VALIDATE MULTIPLE IMPUTATION METHODS THAT EXPLOIT THE MULTIVARIATE AND TIME-SERIES NATURE OF THE DATA TO HANDLE NON-WEAR TIME IN ANALYSES THAT MAKE USE OF ENTIRE PROFILES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL EVALUATE METHODS FOR INCORPORATING MULTIPLE IMPUTATION FOR HANDLING MISSING DATA FROM NON-WEAR WHEN APPLYING ADAPTIVE CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY DISTINCT PATTERNS OF SLEEP AND ACTIVITY IN ORDER TO RELATE THEM TO OUTCOMES IN A GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODEL FRAMEWORK. WE WILL CREATE OPEN-SOURCE USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE ADOPTED AND ENHANCED BY THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. OUR APPROACH INTEGRATES THREE NOVEL DATA RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR METHODS \u2013 TWO WITH KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE ACTIVITY AND NON-WEAR, AND A THIRD GENERATED FROM A UNIQUE FOUR-YEAR LONGITUDINAL TIME SERIES FOR BOTH ACCELEROMETRY AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTOR MEASURES IN A REAL- WORLD SETTING. IT OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP AND ILLUSTRATE METHODS USING DATA GENERATED FROM WEARABLE DEVICES IN A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT THAT INCLUDES MISSING DATA. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO INCORPORATE MISSING DATA METHODS INTO LEARNING ALGORITHMS UNDER A GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODEL FRAMEWORK FOR ACCELEROMETER STUDIES. SUCH METHODS WILL BE CRITICAL FOR BOTH OBSERVATIONAL AND CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH IN REAL-WORLD SETTINGS, WHERE WEAR AND NON-WEAR TIME ARE NOT DIRECTLY OBSERVED.

WE CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, DESIGNS THAT INCLUDE EARLY STOPPING DECISIONS BASED ON DATA GENERATED FROM THE TRIAL AND EXTERNAL PATIENT-LEVEL DATA.  EXTERNAL DATASETS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE FINAL ANALYSES AND INTERIM DECISIONS OF FUTURE SINGLE- ARM AND RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. THEY CAN ALSO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS, BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAT NEED TO BE ENROLLED IN CLINICAL STUDIES AND THEREFORE THEIR DURATION. HOWEVER THE USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION TO ANALYZE CLINICAL TRIALS IS CURRENTLY SPORADIC. INDEED, THE INTEGRATION OF EXTERNAL PATIENT-LEVEL INFORMATION TO TEST NEW TREATMENTS CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF BIAS IN THE EVALUATION OF EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS. AN EFFECTIVE USE OF EXTERNAL DATA IN THE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF CLINICAL STUDIES REQUIRES BOTH, ADEQUATE STATISTICAL METHODOLOGIES, AND VALIDATION ANALYSES, TO QUANTIFY RISKS AND POTENTIAL EFFICIENCY GAINS COMPARED TO STANDARD STATISTICAL PLANS OF SINGLE-ARM AND RANDOMIZED TRIAL DESIGNS. WE WILL DEVELOP NOVEL DESIGNS TO USE EXTERNAL DATA IN FUTURE TRIALS. WE WILL USE COLLECTIONS OF DATASETS IN PROSTATE CANCER, GLIOBLASTOMA, AND LUNG CANCER, INCLUDING PATIENT-LEVEL OUTCOMES AND PROGNOSTIC VARIABLES. THESE COLLECTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY USE EXTERNAL DATA IN CLINICAL STUDIES. WE WILL THEN INTRODUCE AND APPLY VALIDATION METHODS TO EVALUATE STATISTICAL DESIGNS USING DISEASE-SPECIFIC DATA COLLECTIONS, INCLUSIVE OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND REAL WORLD DATA.

EHRS ARE APPEALING BECAUSE THEY CAN OFFER LARGE SAMPLE SIZES, TIMELY INFORMATION, AND A WEALTH OF CLINICAL INFORMATION BEYOND THAT OBTAINED FROM EITHER HEALTH SURVEYS OR ADMINISTRATIVE DATA. HOWEVER, WHILE MILLIONS OF PATIENT RECORDS ARE INCLUDED IN LARGE EHR RECORDS, THEY ARE NOT POPULATION-REPRESENTATIVE RANDOM SAMPLES, A CONSTRAINT THAT POTENTIALLY BIASES INFERENCES BASED ON SUCH DATA AND, THEREFORE, HAS LIMITED THEIR UTILITY FOR POPULATION HEALTH RESEARCH. EHR DATA TYPICALLY CONTAIN MULTIPLE TYPES OF BIASES, PARTICULARLY: 1) SAMPLING INCLUSION BIAS: EHR DATA ONLY INCLUDE INFORMATION ON PATIENTS VISITING PARTICIPATING MEDICAL SYSTEMS, AND THEY PRIMARILY CAPTURE DATA WHEN PATIENTS ARE ILL. EVEN AMONG POPULATIONS WITH A PARTICULAR DISEASE, PATIENTS REPRESENTED IN EHRS TEND TO OVER-REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SICKER AND HAVE HIGHER HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION; 2) SAMPLING FREQUENCY BIAS: THE NUMBERS OF PATIENTS\u2019 ENCOUNTERS AND FEATURES IN EHRS ARE AT VARIOUS FREQUENCIES AND THESE FREQUENCIES CORRELATE WITH BOTH PATIENTS\u2019 CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES; AND 3) INSTITUTION BIAS: EHR SAMPLES OF ANY HOSPITAL REFLECT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS POPULATION SERVED BY THAT SPECIFIC HOSPITAL. CONSEQUENTLY, EHR-BASED RISK PREDICTION MODELS WILL HAVE 1) BIASES IN RISK FACTOR SELECTION AND ESTIMATION FOR POPULATION INFERENCES; 2) DISPARATE MISTREATMENT (UNFAIRNESS) IN TERMS OF VARIATION IN A MODEL\u2019S PREDICTION ACCURACY ACROSS PATIENT SUBGROUPS (SUCH AS GENDER, RACE, AND AGE) WITH VARIOUS SAMPLING INCLUSION PROBABILITIES OR FREQUENCIES; 3) BIASED PREDICTION MODEL TO REFLECT CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS SERVED BY THE LOCAL HOSPITALS. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP: 1) EFFECTIVE SAMPLE-WEIGHTING METHOD TO CORRECT BIASES IN RISK FACTOR SELECTION AND ESTIMATION FOR POPULATION INFERENCES (AIM 1), 2) FLEXIBLE DEEP LEARNING METHOD FOR EHR PERSONALIZED RISK PREDICTION WITH FAIRNESS CRITERIA (AIM 2); AND 3) INNOVATIVE CALIBRATION METHOD TO IMPROVE REPRODUCIBILITY OF EHR-BASED RISK MODELS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS (AIM 3).

MULTI-MODAL COPD DATA - INTERPRETABLE GRAPHICAL MODELS FOR LARGE MULTI-MODAL COPD DATA ABSTRACT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TASKS IN TODAY\u2019S ERA OF PRECISION MEDICINE IS TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS AND THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICAL OUTCOMES. ANOTHER IMPORTANT TASK IS TO DEVELOP INTERPRETABLE, PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR OUTCOMES. IN THE LAST YEARS, MANY MACHINE LEARNING METHODS HAVE DOMINATED THE TASK OF PREDICTIVE MODELING, INCLUDING DEEP LEARNING, RANDOM FORESTS AND OTHERS. THEY ARE FUELED BY THE UNPRECEDENT VOLUME OF DATA THAT HAVE BEEN GENERATED IN SOME RESEARCH AREAS. HOWEVER, THE INTERPRETABILITY OF THESE METHODS IS NOT STRAIGHT FORWARD AND THEIR ACCURACY DECREASES WHEN ONLY SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE TRAINING DATASETS ARE AVAILABLE. FURTHERMORE, THEIR PREDICTIVE MODELS DO NOT UNCOVER THE COMPLEX WEB OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN OTHER VARIABLES IN THE DATASET, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR FULLY UNDERSTANDING DISEASE MECHANISMS. ALSO, MOST SUCH METHODS ARE NOT WELL SUITED TO ACCOMMODATE MIXED DATA TYPES (E.G., CONTINUOUS, DISCRETE) IN THE SAME DATASET. PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODELS (PGMS) OFFER A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE TO CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS, BECAUSE THEY ARE FLEXIBLE AND VERSATILE. THEY CAN IDENTIFY BOTH THE DIRECT (CAUSAL) RELATIONS BETWEEN VARIABLES, POINTING TO DISEASE MECHANISMS, AND BUILD PREDICTIVE MODELS OVER DIVERSE DATA, WITH GOOD RESULTS EVEN WITH SMALLER TRAINING DATASETS. THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR CLASSIFICATION, BIOMARKER SELECTION, IDENTIFICATION OF MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS OF AN OUTCOME, OR FOR MECHANISTIC STUDIES OF PERTURBATIONS OF DISEASE NETWORKS. IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS WE EXTENDED THE PGM THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK TO THE ANALYSIS OF MIXED CONTINUOUS AND DISCRETE VARIABLES, WITH OR WITHOUT UNMEASURED CONFOUNDERS; AND WE CAN NOW EVALUATE AND INCORPORATE PRIOR INFORMATION IN MIXED DATA GRAPH LEARNING. WE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED THOSE METHODS TO DIVERSE CLINICALLY IMPORTANT PROBLEMS, INCLUDING MALIGNANCY PREDICTION OF UNDETERMINED LUNG NODULES, IDENTIFICATION OF MICROBIOME AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING PNEUMONIA, SELECTION OF SNP BIOMARKERS FOR COMBINATION TREATMENT OF CANCER PATIENTS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL INTERPRETABLE METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF ANY-TYPE DATA AND USE THEM TO ADDRESS CLINICALLY RELEVANT QUESTIONS IN COPD, AN IMPORTANT CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE. METHOD EVALUATION WILL BE DONE ON SYNTHETIC AND REAL DATA, INCLUDING PARALLEL DATASETS WITH GENOMIC, GENETIC, IMAGING AND CLINICAL COPD DATA. OUR CENTRAL AIM IS TO IDENTIFY FACTORS OF DISEASE MECHANISMS OF PROGRESSION USING DIFFERENT MODALITIES OF PATIENT DATA. THE DELIVERABLES WILL BE (1) NEW PGM APPROACHES FOR INTEGRATIVE ANALYSIS OF ANY-TYPE DATA; (2) A NEW, FULLY DOCUMENTED SOFTWARE PACKAGE (IN R, PYTHON) THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED IN OTHER PIPELINES; (3) A NEW WEB PORTAL TO DISSEMINATE OUR METHODOLOGIES TO NON-COMPUTER-SAVVY COPD RESEARCHERS; (4) RESULTS ON THE PATHOGENESIS AND PREDICTIVE FEATURES OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). THIS CROSS-DISCIPLINARY TEAM PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT BEYOND THE ABOVE DELIVERABLES, SINCE THE GENERALITY OF OUR APPROACHES MAKES THEM SUITABLE FOR STUDYING ANY DISEASE; AND THEY CAN BE EASILY INTEGRATED INTO PERSONALIZED MEDICINE STRATEGIES WHEN HIGH-THROUGHPUT DATA COLLECTION WILL BECOME A ROUTINE DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE IN ALL HOSPITALS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "369ac1e4-8d93-3063-b933-3586dffba549-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01HL159805_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49739654, "Award ID": "R01EY021590", "Award Amount": 1876008.0, "Award Type": null, "Base Obligation Date": "2011-06-24", "CFDA Number": "93.867", "Description": "NON-CONTACT, THZ SENSING OF CORNEAL HYDRATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3231cda5-201a-6da0-de9e-e9810a848983-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01EY021590_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49716673, "Award ID": "R01AR062002", "Award Amount": 2354862.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2012-02-27", "CFDA Number": "93.846", "Description": "ENHANCING BONE STRENGTH USING COMBINATION DRUG THERAPY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "adf5ba97-e9a1-374f-72a1-40502b70df1a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01AR062002_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49708438, "Award ID": "R01AG041823", "Award Amount": 1230581.0, "Award Type": null, "Base Obligation Date": "2012-07-20", "CFDA Number": "93.866", "Description": "AGE DEPENDENT MECHANICAL VENTILATOR-INDUCED INFLAMMATION: MODELING & EXPERIMENTS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "VA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c6121f36-8222-1039-c78e-e1f5ef0bfaf6-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01AG041823_7529"}, {"internal_id": 161258829, "Award ID": "R00LM014097", "Award Amount": 248999.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-07-24", "CFDA Number": "93.879", "Description": "OPTIMIZING CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT ALERTS USING EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (XAI)", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "af8e08af-9f61-5dc4-b13f-32b17f32dc92-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R00LM014097_7529"}, {"internal_id": 155738511, "Award ID": "R00LM013646", "Award Amount": 331044.84, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-12-19", "CFDA Number": "93.879", "Description": "DISCOVERING CLINICAL ENDPOINTS OF TOXICITY VIA GRAPH MACHINE LEARNING AND SEMANTIC DATA ANALYSIS - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THIS PROJECT PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW METHODS AND DATA RESOURCES TO INTEGRATE MODERN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TECHNIQUES INTO PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF THOSE METHODS AND RESOURCES TO GENERATE NEW HYPOTHESES LINKING PUTATIVE TOXICANTS TO SPECIFIC CLINICAL OUTCOMES. THE RECENT EXPLOSION OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE CHEMICAL AND BIOMEDICAL DATA PROVIDES AN IMMENSELY VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR COMPUTATIONAL TOXICOLOGISTS, BUT EXISTING TECHNIQUES FOR LEARNING FROM THESE DATA PERFORM POORLY AND FAIL TO CAPTURE CRUCIAL PATTERNS THAT SPAN MULTIPLE LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE US FDA MAINTAINS A COMPUTATIONAL TOXICOLOGY DATABASE CATALOGUING OVER 875 THOUSAND CHEMICALS OF TOXICOLOGIC CONCERN, YET ONLY A SMALL HANDFUL OF THESE HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED IN TERMS OF THEIR DOWNSTREAM CLINICAL EFFECTS. HOWEVER, INFORMATICS AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML) PROVIDE SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT MAY SOLVE THIS ISSUE. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON 2 OF THOSE IN PARTICULAR: GRAPH MACHINE LEARNING (GRAPH ML) AND SEMANTIC DATA ANALYSIS. SINCE BOTH OF THESE TECHNIQUES ALLOW FOR THE INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE OTHERWISE INCONGRUENT SOURCES, THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OUTPERFORM SIMPLER TRADITIONAL METHODS FOR PATTERN DISCOVERY, WHILE INCREASING BOTH INFERENTIAL CAPACITY AND STATISTICAL POWER.  OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT INDUCTIVE LEARNING ON SEMANTIC GRAPH DATA PROVIDES AN EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR GENERATING AND VALIDATING TRANSLATIONAL AND MECHANISTIC CONCLUSIONS FROM EXISTING PUBLIC TOXICOLOGY DATA. IN AIM 1 (K99), A NEW DATA INFRASTRUCTURE\u2014DRIVEN BY A LARGE, ONTOLOGY-CONTROLLED GRAPH DATABASE AGGREGATING PUBLIC TOXICOLOGY DATA\u2014WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AND EVALUATED ON SEVERAL IMPORTANT TASKS IN COMPUTATIONAL TOXICOLOGY. TOGETHER, THESE RESOURCES WILL BE NAMED `COMPTOXAI'. AIM 2 (K99) WILL DEVELOP AND APPLY A GRAPH MACHINE LEARNING STRATEGY TO PREDICT NEW ADVERSE OUTCOME PATHWAYS (AOPS) IN THE GRAPH DATABASE. IMPORTANTLY, THIS AIM WILL USE AN AUTOMATED MACHINE LEARNING (AUTO ML) APPROACH TO DISCOVER OPTIMIZED NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES FOR THIS PREDICTION TASK IN A DATA-DRIVEN MANNER. THIS AUTO ML STRATEGY WILL USE ESTIMATION OF DISTRIBUTION ALGORITHMS (EDAS) TO SEARCH FOR OPTIMIZED NETWORK ARCHITECTURES IN A PROBABILISTIC MANNER. AN EXPECTED SIDE EFFECT OF THE AUTO ML APPROACH IS INCREASED MODEL INTERPRETABILITY OVER EXISTING APPLICATIONS OF GRAPH ML.

I HAVE A VERY STRONG MENTORING TEAM. MY MENTORS, DRS. MICHAEL BECICH (PRIMARY), GREGORY COOPER, HENG HUANG, AND MICHAEL WAGNER, ALL OF WHOM ARE EXPERIENCED WITH RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH PLAN: THE RESEARCH GOAL OF MY PROPOSED K99/R00 GRANT IS TO INCREASE THE RE-USE OF COMPUTABLE BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE, WHICH IS KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTED IN COMPUTER-INTERPRETABLE FORMALISMS SUCH AS BAYESIAN NETWORKS AND NEURAL NETWORKS. I REFER TO SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AS MODELS. ALTHOUGH MODELS CAN BE RE-USED IN TOTO IN ANOTHER SETTING, THERE MAY BE LOSS OF PERFORMANCE OR, EVEN MORE PROBLEMATICALLY, FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCHES BETWEEN THE DATA REQUIRED BY THE MODEL AND THE DATA AVAILABLE IN THE NEW SETTING MAKING THEIR RE-USE IMPOSSIBLE. THE FIELD OF TRANSFER LEARNING DEVELOPS ALGORITHMS FOR TRANSFERRING KNOWLEDGE FROM ONE SETTING TO ANOTHER. TRANSFER LEARNING, A SUB-AREA OF MACHINE LEARNING, EXPLICITLY DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN A SOURCE SETTING, WHICH HAS THE MODEL THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO RE-USE, AND A TARGET SETTING, WHICH HAS DATA INSUFFICIENT FOR DERIVING A MODEL FROM DATA AND THEREFORE NEEDS TO RE-USE A MODEL FROM A SOURCE SETTING.

SOME OF THESE LINKS INDICATE STABLE DEPENDENCIES DEEMED AS CAUSES. CAUSAL INSIGHT ALLOWS REVERSE- ENGINEERING DISEASE. IF CONFOUNDING IS NOT ADDRESSED, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH CAUSATIVE FROM CORRELATIVE LINKS. OUR APPROACH IS TO IDENTIFY CONFOUNDERS EXPLICITLY. GRAPHICAL CAUSAL MODELING (GCMS) CAN DISCOVER CAUSAL LINKS FROM DATA AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. GCMS SUMMARIZE CAUSAL LINKS BETWEEN VARIABLES. AUTOMATED SELECTION OF VARIABLES WOULD ALLOW GCMS TO SCALE AND YIELD MORE INSIGHT FROM DATA. LITERATURE-BASED DISCOVERY (LBD) METHODS WERE DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY LINKS BETWEEN CONCEPTS IN THE LITERATURE. ADVANCED METHODS PERMIT THE SEARCH FOR CONCEPTS LINKED TO EACH OTHER THROUGH SPECIFIC VERBS, E.G., \u201cCAUSES\u201d, \u201cTREATS\u201d. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT WE CAN EXPLOIT STRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTED FROM THE LITERATURE TO INFORM GCMS. IN PRIOR WORK, WE FOUND THAT LBD + GCM WAS BETTER AT IDENTIFYING SIDE-EFFECTS IN EHR DATA THAN TRADITIONAL METHODS. COMPARED TO METHODS WHICH USE SOLELY DATA, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT OUR METHOD WILL INCREASE THE ABILITY TO DETECT CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS FROM EHR DATA. THE FIRST AIM IS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH LBD-INFORMED GCM IMPROVES THE IDENTIFICATION OF CAUSAL LINKS FOR DRUG SAFETY. WE WILL BUILD LBD-INFORMED GCMS USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE REFERENCE DATASETS FOR DRUG SAFETY. THESE REFERENCE DATASETS CONTAIN DRUG/SIDE-EFFECT PAIRS FOR PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING.

CANCER IS MAINLY CAUSED BY SOMATIC GENOME ALTERATIONS (SGAS) THAT PERTURB CELLULAR SIGNALING PATHWAYS, AND ABERRATIONS IN PATHWAYS EVENTUALLY LEAD TO CANCER DEVELOPMENT. PRECISION ONCOLOGY AIMS TO ACCURATELY DETECT AND TARGET TUMOR-SPECIFIC ABERRATIONS, BUT CHALLENGES REMAIN. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO WELL-ESTABLISHED METHOD TO DETECT THE ACTIVATION STATES OF SIGNALING PATHWAYS, AND THE COMMON PRACTICE OF USING MUTATION STATUS OF A TARGETED GENE AS THE INDICATOR FOR PRESCRIBING A MOLECULARLY TARGETED DRUG HAS LIMITATIONS. TO OVERCOME SUCH LIMITATION, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT, BY CLOSELY SIMULATING THE HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION OF CELLULAR SIGNALING SYSTEMS, DLMS CAN BE USED TO SYSTEMATICALLY IDENTIFY MAJOR CANCER SIGNALING PATHWAYS, TO DETECT TUMOR-SPECIFIC ABERRATIONS IN SIGNALING PATHWAYS, AND TO PREDICT CANCER CELL SENSITIVITY TO ANTI-CANCER DRUGS.  WE WILL DEVELOP MODELS THAT MORE PRECISELY REPRESENT THE STATE OF SIGNALING SYSTEMS IN CANCER CELLS AND USE SUCH INFORMATION TO ENHANCE PRECISION ONCOLOGY.

FURTHERMORE, PATIENT OUTCOMES OFTEN HAVE HETEROGENOUS CAUSES AND RE- QUIRE INFORMATION TO BE SYNTHESIZED FROM SEVERAL CLINICAL LAB MEASURES AND PATIENT VISITS. THE CORE CHALLENGE AT HAND IS OVERCOMING THE MISMATCH BETWEEN DATA REPRESENTATIONS IN THE EHR AND THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLY- ING COMMONLY USED STATISTICAL AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML) METHODS. TO THIS END, THIS PROJECT PROPOSES NOVEL WRAPPER-BASED METHODS FOR LEARNING INFORMATIVE FEATURES FROM EHR DATA. BOTH METHODS PROPOSE SPECIALIZED OPERATORS TO HANDLE SEQUENTIAL DATA, TIME DELAYS, AND VARIABLE INTERACTIONS, AND HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DISCOVER UNDERLYING CLINICAL RULES/DECISIONS THAT AFFECT PATIENT OUTCOMES. IMPORTANTLY, BOTH METHODS ALSO PRODUCE ARCHIVES OF POSSIBLE MODELS THAT REPRESENT THE BEST TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN COMPLEXITY AND ACCURACY, WHICH ASSISTS IN MODEL INTERPRETATION. THESE METHOD ADVANCES ARE MADE POSSIBLE BY ENCODING A RICH SET OF DATA OPERATIONS AS NODES IN A DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH, AND OPTIMIZING THE GRAPH STRUCTURES USING MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS RESEARCH IS THAT MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION CAN LEARN EFFECTIVE DATA REPRESENTATIONS FROM THE EHR TO PRODUCE ACCURATE, EXPLANATORY MODELS OF PATIENT OUTCOMES. PRELIMINARY WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THESE METHODS CAN EFFECTIVELY LEARN LOW-ORDER DATA REPRESENTATIONS THAT IMPROVE THE PREDICTIVE ABILITY OF SEVERAL STATE- OF-THE-ART ML METHODS. THIS TECHNIQUE DEMONSTRATES GOOD SCALING PROPERTIES WITH HIGH-DIMENSIONAL BIOMEDICAL DATA. AIM 1 (K99) IS TO DEVELOP A MULTI-OBJECTIVE FEATURE ENGINEERING METHOD THAT PAIRS WITH EXISTING ML METHODS TO ITERATIVELY IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE BY CONSTRUCTING NEW FEATURES FROM THE RAW DATA AND USING FEEDBACK FROM THE TRAINED MODEL TO GUIDE FEATURE CONSTRUCTION. IN AIM 2 (K99), THIS METHOD IS APPLIED TO FORM PREDICTIVE MODELS OF THE RISK OF HEART DISEASE AND HEART FAILURE USING LONGITUDINAL EHR DATA. THE RESULTANT MODELS WILL BE INTER- PRETED WITH THE HELP OF MENTORS IN ORDER TO TRANSLATE PREDICTIONS INTO CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR AIM 3 (R00), A SECOND METHOD IS PROPOSED THAT USES A SIMILAR FRAMEWORK TO OPTIMIZE EXISTING NEURAL NETWORK APPROACHES IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY THEIR STRUCTURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHILE MAINTAINING ACCURACY. THE GOAL OF AIM 4 (R00) IS TO IDENTIFY HOSPITAL PATIENTS WHO ARE AT RISK OF READMISSION AND PROPOSE POINT-OF-CARE STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THAT RISK. THIS GOAL IS FACILITATED THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED METHODS TO PATIENT DATA COLLECTED FROM THE HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, THE GEISINGER HEALTH SYSTEM, AND PUBLICLY

CLINICAL RESEARCH BUT ARE SUBJECT TO MANY LIMITATIONS INCLUDING HIGH COSTS, LIMITED GENERALIZABILITY, AND SMALL SAMPLE SIZES IN PATIENT SUBGROUPS. BY CONTRAST, ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND CONTAIN INFORMATION ON LARGE AND REPRESENTATIVE PATIENT COHORTS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY CAPTURE THE UNCONTROLLED OBSERVATIONS OF MANY CLINICIANS, THEY ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO BIAS. THE RECENT AVAILABILITY OF THE RAW DATA FROM RCTS HAS CREATED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE THEM WITH THAT FROM EHRS, AND TO INNOVATE METHODS THAT EXPLOIT THE DISTINCT ADVANTAGES OF EACH DATASET.  WE PROPOSE TO IDENTIFY THE ZONE OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THESE DATA AND BUILD BRIDGES IN DATA REPRESENTATIONS. THESE BRIDGES COULD ENABLE US TO BETTER EMULATE RANDOMIZED TRIALS USING EHR DATA AND MEASURE THE SAME EFFECTS SEEN IN THE TRIALS. CONSEQUENTLY, IT WOULD ALLOW US TO STUDY SUBGROUPS THAT WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE PIVOTAL TRIALS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW DRUG APPROVALS BY THE FDA.  WE WILL TEST THESE IDEAS OUT IN THE CONTEXT OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC) AND SCALE TO OTHERS IN FUTURE WORK. WE HAVE OBTAINED ACCESS TO THE RAW DATA FROM 12 RCTS IN UC (N=6,226). THESE DATA CONTAIN TIMED AND STRUCTURED MEASUREMENTS OF DISEASE ACTIVITY INCLUDING THE MAYO SCORE, A COMPOSITE SCORE OF PATIENT SYMPTOMS AND ENDOSCOPIC SEVERITY. WE HAVE ALSO OBTAINED ACCESS TO THE EHR DATA OF 3,270 UC PATIENTS TREATED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. THESE DATA CONTAIN SIMILAR DATA AS RCTS BUT LARGELY IN AN UNSTRUCTURED FORM. IN ADDITION, THESE ASSESSMENTS TEND TO BE INCOMPLETE RELATIVE TO TRIALS DUE TO COSTS AND INVASIVENESS OF SOME TESTS. WE WILL ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM OF UNHARMONIZED AND INCOMPLETE EHR DATA IN THREE AIMS.  IN AIM 1, WE WILL HARMONIZE THE RCT DATA INTO AN ANALYSIS-READY FORMAT. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP TEXT CLASSIFICATION TOOLS TO TRANSFORM FREE-TEXTED EHR DATA INTO MAYO SUBSCORES, AND VALIDATE THESE TOOLS AGAINST DATA FROM A SECOND CENTER. IN AIM 2, WE WILL INTEGRATE THE RCT AND EHR DATA, TRAIN ALGORITHMS TO IMPUTE RCT- BASED REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PATIENT STATE FROM PARTIAL MEASUREMENTS MADE IN EHRS, AND TEST THEM UNDER CONDITIONS TYPIFYING REAL-WORLD DATA CAPTURE. IN AIM 3, WE WILL USE THESE ALGORITHMS TO HARMONIZE EHR DATA, VALIDATE THEM AS A TOOL TO RECOVER THE SAME EFFECTS AS RCTS, AND STUDY NEW PATIENT SUBGROUPS.

HOWEVER, THE ACCEPTANCE RATE FOR CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS) ALERTS, A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF EHRS, IS LESS THAN 10%. THE LARGE NUMBER OF LOW RELEVANCE ALERTS (E.G. A WEIGHT LOSS ALERT DURING A CARDIAC RESUSCITATION) NOT ONLY INCREASES THE BURDEN ON CLINICIANS, BUT CAN LEAD TO THE ONSET OF ALERT FATIGUE, RESULTING IN THE NEGLECT OF IMPORTANT ALERTS AND POSING A SERIOUS THREAT TO PATIENT SAFETY. CURRENTLY, ALERTS ARE IMPROVED PRIMARILY THROUGH MANUAL REVIEW AND BY COLLECTING USER FEEDBACK. HOWEVER, THESE METHODS ARE LABOR- INTENSIVE AND DO NOT ALLOW FOR A TIMELY ANALYSIS OF USER RESPONSES TO ALERTS FROM A COMPREHENSIVE ASPECT. THE AMOUNT OF ALERT LOG DATA IS LARGE, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER GENERATED OVER 3 MILLION ALERT FIRINGS IN 2020. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO UTILIZE THE DATA FROM THE ALERT LOG AND EHR TO DEVELOP A DATA-DRIVEN PROCESS TO GENERATE SUGGESTIONS FOR REFINING ALERT LOGIC OR IMPROVING CLINICAL PROCESSES. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, I PROPOSE TO USE EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (XAI) COMBINED WITH BIAS MITIGATION TECH- NIQUES TO BUILD PREDICTIVE MODELS THAT COMPREHENSIVELY LEARN USER RESPONSES TO ALERTS AND IN TURN AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE RESPONSIBLE SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL LOGIC OF ALERTS.

THE RECENT EXPLOSION OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE CHEMICAL AND BIOMEDICAL DATA PROVIDES AN IMMENSELY VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR COMPUTATIONAL TOXICOLOGISTS, BUT EXISTING TECHNIQUES FOR LEARNING FROM THESE DATA PERFORM POORLY AND FAIL TO CAPTURE CRUCIAL PATTERNS THAT SPAN MULTIPLE LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE US FDA MAINTAINS A COMPUTATIONAL TOXICOLOGY DATABASE CATALOGUING OVER 875 THOUSAND CHEMICALS OF TOXICOLOGIC CONCERN, YET ONLY A SMALL HANDFUL OF THESE HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED IN TERMS OF THEIR DOWNSTREAM CLINICAL EFFECTS. HOWEVER, INFORMATICS AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML) PROVIDE SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT MAY SOLVE THIS ISSUE. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON 2 OF THOSE IN PARTICULAR: GRAPH MACHINE LEARNING (GRAPH ML) AND SEMANTIC DATA ANALYSIS. SINCE BOTH OF THESE TECHNIQUES ALLOW FOR THE INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE OTHERWISE INCONGRUENT SOURCES, THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OUTPERFORM SIMPLER TRADITIONAL METHODS FOR PATTERN DISCOVERY, WHILE INCREASING BOTH INFERENTIAL CAPACITY AND STATISTICAL POWER.  OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT INDUCTIVE LEARNING ON SEMANTIC GRAPH DATA PROVIDES AN EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR GENERATING AND VALIDATING TRANSLATIONAL AND MECHANISTIC CONCLUSIONS FROM EXISTING PUBLIC TOXICOLOGY DATA.

IMPORTANTLY, THIS AIM WILL USE AN AUTOMATED MACHINE LEARNING (AUTO ML) APPROACH TO DISCOVER OPTIMIZED NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES FOR THIS PREDICTION TASK IN A DATA-DRIVEN MANNER. THIS AUTO ML STRATEGY WILL USE ESTIMATION OF DISTRIBUTION ALGORITHMS (EDAS) TO SEARCH FOR OPTIMIZED NETWORK ARCHITECTURES IN A PROBABILISTIC MANNER.

SOME OF THESE LINKS INDICATE STABLE DEPENDENCIES DEEMED AS CAUSES. CAUSAL INSIGHT ALLOWS REVERSE- ENGINEERING DISEASE. IF CONFOUNDING IS NOT ADDRESSED, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH CAUSATIVE FROM CORRELATIVE LINKS. OUR APPROACH IS TO IDENTIFY CONFOUNDERS EXPLICITLY. GRAPHICAL CAUSAL MODELING (GCMS) CAN DISCOVER CAUSAL LINKS FROM DATA AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. GCMS SUMMARIZE CAUSAL LINKS BETWEEN VARIABLES. AUTOMATED SELECTION OF VARIABLES WOULD ALLOW GCMS TO SCALE AND YIELD MORE INSIGHT FROM DATA. LITERATURE-BASED DISCOVERY (LBD) METHODS WERE DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY LINKS BETWEEN CONCEPTS IN THE LITERATURE. ADVANCED METHODS PERMIT THE SEARCH FOR CONCEPTS LINKED TO EACH OTHER THROUGH SPECIFIC VERBS, E.G., \u201cCAUSES\u201d, \u201cTREATS\u201d. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT WE CAN EXPLOIT STRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTED FROM THE LITERATURE TO INFORM GCMS. IN PRIOR WORK, WE FOUND THAT LBD + GCM WAS BETTER AT IDENTIFYING SIDE-EFFECTS IN EHR DATA THAN TRADITIONAL METHODS. COMPARED TO METHODS WHICH USE SOLELY DATA, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT OUR METHOD WILL INCREASE THE ABILITY TO DETECT CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS FROM EHR DATA. THE FIRST AIM IS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH LBD-INFORMED GCM IMPROVES THE IDENTIFICATION OF CAUSAL LINKS FOR DRUG SAFETY. WE WILL BUILD LBD-INFORMED GCMS USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE REFERENCE DATASETS FOR DRUG SAFETY. THESE REFERENCE DATASETS CONTAIN DRUG/SIDE-EFFECT PAIRS FOR PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING.

(B) DEFINE THE ABILITY OF ROBUST LBD-INFORMED GCM TO VALIDATE DRUG REPURPOSING CANDIDATES FOR TREATING AD SYMPTOMS.

DATASETS HAS FUELED CALLS FOR TARGETED RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF INDIVIDUALS FROM POPULATIONS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT PARTICIPATED IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. YET, DEFINITIONS OF WHAT CONSTITUTES DIVERSITY, ACCORDING TO WHOM, AND HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT GOALS OF INCLUSION REMAIN ELUSIVE. PRECISION MEDICINE RESEARCH (PMR) IS A SIGNIFICANT AND CONSEQUENTIAL SPHERE OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY WHERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MEANINGS AND EFFECTS OF DIVERSITY ARE BEING WORKED OUT IN PRACTICE AND INCREASINGLY INSTITUTIONALIZED. APPROACHES TO INCREASING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS IN PRECISION MEDICINE RESEARCH ARE HETEROGENEOUS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR IMPACT. TO FILL THIS GAP, WE HAVE EMBARKED ON THREE STUDIES THAT EMPIRICALLY EXAMINE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES WITH PMR AND ITS VARIED APPROACHES TO ENHANCING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OF UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS AS RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS. THIS PROJECT WILL SYNTHESIZE DATA AND FINDINGS FROM ACROSS THESE STUDIES, TO DEVELOP WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST BOOK-LENGTH ANALYSIS OF DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE IN PMR, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR MEANINGFUL INCLUSION. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS GRANT APPLICATION IS TO COMPLETE A BOOK MANUSCRIPT THAT WILL EXAMINE THE ETHICAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF CONCEPTS OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION, HOW THEY ARE PUT INTO PRACTICE BY STAKEHOLDERS IN PRECISION MEDICINE RESEARCH, AND THEIR IMPACTS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDINGS OF HEALTH AND HUMAN VARIATION. THE DATA TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS BOOK COME FROM THREE NIH-FUNDED STUDIES LED BY THE CO-AUTHORS THAT INCLUDE FOCUS GROUPS WITH RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE PATIENTS TO ASSESS THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE USE AND GOVERNANCE OF CLINICAL DATA AND SAMPLES; A REVIEW OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THREE NIH-FUNDED PMR CONSORTIA AND 5 PMR RESEARCH SITES; OBSERVATIONS OF PMR CONSORTIA AND SITE ACTIVITIES; AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH PMR FUNDERS, RESEARCHERS, PARTICIPANTS, AND INDIVIDUALS FROM DIVERSE POPULATIONS BEING RECRUITED FOR PMR. SUCH A BOOK WILL OFFER AN EMPIRICALLY INFORMED, ETHNOGRAPHICALLY RICH ANALYSIS AND REFLECTION ON HOW PMR DIVERSITY PRACTICES ARE UNFOLDING, AND WITH WHAT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE POPULATIONS IT SEEKS TO SERVE AND FOR THE LARGER SOCIETY IN WHICH IT IS EMBEDDED AND HELPS TO SHAPE.

THIS OFT- MADE OBSERVATION, HOWEVER, OVERLOOKED MEASLES' LONG HISTORY. EXTANT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, MEASLES HAD ALWAYS BEEN SHAPED BY THE TIMES AND PLACES IN WHICH IT MADE ITS APPEARANCE. URBANIZATION, COLONIZATION, TRADE, WAR, SCHOOLING PATTERNS, TREATMENT, AND OTHER SOCIAL, CULTURAL, POLITICAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS SHAPED AND RESHAPED MEASLES OVER AND OVER, CHANGING IT FROM EPIDEMIC TO ENDEMIC TO ELIMINATED AND BACK AGAIN, FROM \u201cSEVERE\u201d TO \u201cMILD\u201d AND VICE VERSA, AND FROM A UNIVERSAL SCOURGE TO A COMMONPLACE FEATURE OF CHILDHOOD.

THIS PROJECT WILL CONSTRUCT A GLOBAL HISTORY OF MEASLES BY FOLLOWING THE DISEASE FROM MEDIEVAL ISLAMIC CLINICAL DESCRIPTIONS TO CONTEMPORARY BATTLES OVER ITS ELIMINATION. THE PROJECT HAS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. FIRST, IT WILL PRODUCE THE FIRST BOOK ON THE GLOBAL HISTORY OF MEASLES, WITH A FOCUS ON HOW CONCEPTIONS AND PERCEPTIONS OF MEASLES ROOTED IN SPACE AND TIME HAVE LONG MADE MEASLES BOTH A STABLE AND DYNAMIC ILLNESS. SECOND, IT WILL ANALYZE MEASLES' HISTORICAL ROLES IN THE EMERGENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT IS NOW CALLED GLOBAL HEALTH. THIRD, IT WILL EXAMINE AND ELUCIDATE MEASLES' PRACTICAL AND SYMBOLIC HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN EFFORTS TO MANAGE OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES OVER TIME, FROM SMALLPOX TO COVID. THE BOOK WILL BE PUBLISHED BY POLITY PRESS AND WRITTEN FOR AN AUDIENCE OF ACADEMICS, POLICYMAKERS, ADVOCATES, AND THE PUBLIC. RESEARCH METHODS FOR THIS HISTORICAL PROJECT INCLUDE BOTH SECONDARY SOURCE SYNTHESIS AND PRIMARY SOURCE LOCATION AND ANALYSIS. THE PROJECT DRAWS ON A BROAD SECONDARY LITERATURE ON THE HISTORIES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE, EPIDEMICS, MEDICINE, AND GLOBAL HEALTH. ITS PRIMARY SOURCE BASE CONSISTS OF EVIDENCE FROM DATABASES OF PERIODICALS, GOVERNMENT REPORTS, AND SCIENTIFIC PAPERS; DIGITALLY ACCESSIBLE DOCUMENTS, ARCHIVES, AND MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS; AND BRICK-AND-MORTAR ARCHIVAL COLLECTIONS.

ONE OUT OF EVERY 13 US CHILDREN HAS A FOOD ALLERGY, AND NEARLY HALF OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE ALLERGIC TO MULTIPLE FOODS. BECAUSE FOOD ALLERGIES CAN BE LIFE-THREATENING, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN INVESTED IN FINDING EFFECTIVE THERAPIES. THESE NOVEL THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS\u2014INCLUDING ONE RECENT FDA-APPROVED DRUG, AN ARRAY OF CLINICAL TRIALS, AND EVEN UN- REGULATED FOOD-BASED TREATMENTS\u2014HAVE ATTRACTED CONSIDERABLE PARENTAL INTEREST DESPITE POTENTIALLY SIG- NIFICANT RISKS. INDEED, PRELIMINARY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT PARENTS OFTEN HAVE A HIGHER TOLERANCE FOR THE RISKS OF THESE MEDICAL TREATMENTS COMPARED TO THE RISKS FROM FOOD. I AM CURRENTLY COMPLETING AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF PEANUT ALLERGY CLINICAL TRIALS, AND THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL EXPAND AND CONTINUE THIS LINE OF RESEARCH FOR THE SCHOLARLY BOOK THROUGH THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) EX- PLORE THE EXPERIENCES AND PERCEPTIONS OF PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH PEANUT OR OTHER FOOD ALLERGIES WHO HAVE NOT PURSUED CLINICAL TRIALS, (2) DOCUMENT HOW UNREGULATED FOOD ALLERGY TREATMENTS ARE BEING OFFERED THROUGH PRIVATE PRACTICES, AND (3) INTEGRATE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS FROM AIMS 1 & 2 WITH MY CURRENT ETHNO- GRAPHIC WORK ON FOOD ALLERGY CLINICAL TRIAL PARTICIPATION. FOR AIM 1, I WILL CONDUCT 30 INTERVIEWS WITH PAR- ENTS WHO ARE (A) PRACTICING AVOIDANCE OF THEIR CHILDREN'S FOOD ALLERGENS WITH NO ADDITIONAL TREATMENT, (B) TREATING THEIR CHILDREN'S PEANUT ALLERGY WITH THE FDA-APPROVED DRUG, OR (C) TREATING THEIR CHILDREN'S FOOD ALLERGIES WITH UNREGULATED THERAPIES. FOR AIM 2, I WILL CONDUCT 10 INTERVIEWS WITH CLINICIANS WHO OFFER UNREGULATED FOOD-BASED TREATMENTS FOR FOOD ALLERGIES TO ANALYZE HOW THEY DESCRIBE THEIR PRACTICES, INCLUD- ING ANY SAFETY PROTOCOLS THEY HAVE IN PLACE. THE BOOK MANUSCRIPT WILL BE WRITTEN AS PART OF AIM 3, WHEREIN I WILL USE DATA FROM BOTH PROJECTS TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF FOOD ALLERGY THERAPEUTICS.

THIS BOOK WILL EXAMINE THE BIOMEDICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL, COMMERCIAL, AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF DIVERSITY\u2019S EMERGENCE AS A CENTRAL ORGANIZING CONCEPT ANIMATING AN ARRAY OF PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH AGENDAS AIMED AT DRIVING FORWARD GENOMIC INNOVATION. AS DIVERSITY HAS COME TO THE FORE AS A CENTRAL ORGANIZING CONCEPT OF MODERN GENOMIC RESEARCH AND POLICY, DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN SOCIAL AND BIOLOGICAL RATIONALES FOR FOREGROUNDING RACIAL CATEGORIES IN GENOMIC ENTERPRISES HAVE BECOME CONFLATED, CONFUSED, AND CONFOUNDED. SUCH CONCEPTUAL ENTANGLEMENTS HAVE PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS BOTH FOR OUR ON-GOING UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE NATURE OF HUMAN SIMILARLY/DIFFERENCE AND FOR CONCOMITANT ALLOCATION OF GOODS, RESOURCES, AND STATUS RELATING TO RACE AND RACE-RELATIONS IN SOCIETY TODAY. THESE INITIATIVES PRESENT A DOUBLE-PRONGED RE-REIFICATION OF RACE AS GENETIC: FIRST, THROUGH THE CONFLATION OF SOCIALLY DEFINED RACIAL GROUPS WITH DISTINCTIVE AND DISCRETE GENETIC CLUSTERS; AND SECOND, THROUGH THE MOLECULARIZATION OF SOCIAL PHENOMENA THAT DISPARATELY IMPACT RACIAL GROUPS. THE FORMER THREATENS TO REINVIGORATE DANGEROUS, REDUCTIVE, AND RACIST CONSTRUCTIONS OF RACE AS GENETIC; THE LATTER THREATENS TO GENETICIZE HEALTH DISPARITIES THEMSELVES, BOTH BLAMING THE VICTIMS AND DIRECTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE SOCIAL, LEGAL, AND POLITICAL INITIATIVES THAT NEED TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SUCH PROBLEMS. DIVERSITY IS A CONCEPT READY-MADE FOR CONFLATING RACIAL AND GENETIC CATEGORIES BECAUSE DIVERSITY ITSELF HAS ROOTS IN BOTH WORLDS. DIVERSITY IS A USEFUL CONCEPT, BUT LIKE RACE ITSELF, IT CAN BE HARD TO DEFINE AND EVEN HARDER TO USE IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY THAT AVOIDS THE DANGERS OF GENETIC ESSENTIALISM AND RACIAL REIFICATION. HENCE THE NEED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES IN EACH NEW MANIFESTATION AS THEY ARISE. TO DO THIS, IT IS NECESSARY TO TRACE THE STORIES OF THESE DIFFERENT FORMS OF DIVERSITY THROUGH A BOOK-LENGTH TREATMENT THAT WILL ALLOW FOR A FULL EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF MANAGING RACE AND DIVERSITY AT THE INTERSECTIONS OF LAW, POLITICS, AND BIOMEDICINE. HAVING TRACED THE PROGRESSION OF THE ENTANGLEMENTS OF DIVERSITIES FROM THE 1970S TO THE PRESENT-DAY, THE BOOK WILL DRAW PRACTICAL LESSONS AND PROPOSE CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE MORE CAREFUL, DELIBERATE, AND PRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF RACE AND REPRESENTATION IN THE INTERSECTING DOMAINS OF BIOMEDICINE, LAW, AND POLITICS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4787a47d-4e7a-9c8a-99e6-91ba7f4c9b8b-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_G13LM013533_7529"}, {"internal_id": 134228759, "Award ID": "G13LM013272", "Award Amount": 49931.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-02", "CFDA Number": "93.879", "Description": "GENETIC COUNSELORS AND THE TRANSLATION OF GENOMIC MEDICINE IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING TO PRIVATE BIOTECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS, IN THE FIRST TWO DECADES OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY IT IS CLEAR THAT GENOMIC MEDICINE IS NOW VIEWED AS A KEY COMPONENT OF HEALTH RESEARCH, HEALTH INFORMATION, AND HEALTH SERVICES.

POST-RESETTLEMENT UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY, POOR ENGLISH SKILLS, SOCIOECONOMIC PRESSURES, CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH PREVENTIVE SERVICES, AND INABILITY TO NAVIGATE THE MAZE OF THE US HEALTH CARE SYSTEM POSE SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS TO REFUGEE ACCESS TO NEEDED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (RH) CARE LEADING TO DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH OUTCOMES AND TO HIGHER CERVICAL CANCER RATES. AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO ACHIEVE HEALTH EQUITY FOR REFUGEES AND SIVS IS ACCESS TO ACCURATE AND UNDERSTANDABLE INFORMATION ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NEEDS AND SERVICES. IN THIS 3-YEAR STUDY. WITH EXPERT AND OUTREACH SUPPORT FROM THE DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP SERVICES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE (UCI) AND THE SACRAMENTO PUBLIC LIBRARY, THE CALIFORNIA'S REFUGEE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NETWORK (REPRONET) WILL LEVERAGE ITS SOLIDLY ESTABLISHED REGIONAL ACADEMIC \u2013 REFUGEE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS TO ENHANCE AFGHAN AND ARAB REFUGEE WOMEN'S KNOWLEDGE AND ACCESS TO ACCURATE AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE RH INFORMATION. KEY REPRONET PARTNERS IN THIS STUDY WILL BE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS AND MUSLIM AMERICAN SOCIETY SOCIAL SERVICES FOUNDATION (MAS-SSF).

THESE ARE AMPLIFIED DURING DISRUPTIONS SUCH AS COVID, WHEN ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND RESOURCES IS PERTURBED. LOW PROFICIENCY IS STRONGLY LINKED TO ADVERSE SCHOOL, VOCATIONAL AND HEALTH OUTCOMES, WITH ESTIMATED COSTS >$350 BILLION/YEAR. AS PARENTS ARE A CHILD\u2019S \u201cFIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT TEACHERS,\u201d HOME READING ROUTINES HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THESE OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE WIDE DISPARITIES IN THESE BETWEEN HIGH- AND LOW-RESOURCE FAMILIES, FUELED BY HOUSEHOLD STRESSORS, CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, LITERACY CHALLENGES AND OTHER FACTORS. MARGINALIZED FAMILIES ALSO OFTEN FACE BARRIERS TO ACCESS OF RELIABLE LITERACY-PROMOTING INFORMATION, PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES, WORSENING DISPARITIES. GIVEN TRUSTED ACCESS TO FAMILIES WHEN PARENTING ROUTINES ARE SHAPED, HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE POISED TO HELP MITIGATE THESE BARRIERS, YET GUIDANCE TENDS TO BE GENERAL, INCONSISTENT AND CAN FADE-OUT AT HOME. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO ENHANCE, \u201cLOCALIZE\u201d AND TEST A NEW, FREE MOBILE APP DESIGNED TO PROVIDE RELIABLE SHARED READING GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES FOR PARENTS (READING BEES; RB) IN AN EFFICIENT, ENGAGING WAY. THE RATIONALE IS THAT NO SIMILAR APPROACH EXISTS, RB IS FREE AND DESIGNED TO ENHANCE EXISTING PROGRAMS, AND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT ITS FEATURES WILL BE USEFUL AND EFFECTIVE. CONTENT IS EVIDENCE-BASED AND HAS BEEN CO-DEVELOPED WITH INPUT FROM COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND FAMILIES FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. CORE PRINCIPLES ARE CLARITY, CREDIBILITY, FLEXIBILITY (E.G., PARENTS SET THEIR OWN GOALS), RESPONSIVENESS (CHILD AGE, FAMILY CONCERNS, ZIP), ENGAGING CONTENT (TIPS, VIDEOS, RESOURCES) AND POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT (\u201cLITCOIN\u201d AWARDS). THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO USE RB TO HELP IMPROVE READING AND LITERACY OUTCOMES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, TEAMS IN 3 CULTURALLY DISTINCT AREAS (OH, WV, FL) WILL COLLABORATE IN A 3-YEAR PROJECT. CONTENT WILL FIRST BE ADDED TO ADDRESS NEEDS IN EACH COMMUNITY: LISTS OF LOCAL READING-RELATED RESOURCES CURATED BY AREA STAKEHOLDERS AND A SPANISH LANGUAGE VERSION OF RB. ENHANCED, \u201cLOCALIZED\u201d RB WILL THEN BE TESTED WITH PARENTS IN EACH AREA, FIRST THROUGH FOCUS GROUPS TO GAUGE USEFULNESS AND GUIDE REFINEMENT, AND THEN BY PROVIDING RB TO PARENTS (AGES 0-6) DURING CLINIC VISITS AND MEASURING USE OVER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS. OUTCOME MEASURES INVOLVE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTANCE AND USEFLNESS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS WILL BE ENGAGED BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT RESOURCES IN THEIR AREA; FAMILIES WILL RATE RB CONTENT AS USEFUL AND USE RB OFTEN, ESPECIALLY TO EARN LITCOIN AWARDS; AND IMPROVED ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND RESOURCES WILL FUEL BETTER READING AND LITERACY OUTCOMES.

ASD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS CAN VARY BROADLY IN THEIR PRESENTATION, FROM RELATIVELY MILD IMPAIRMENTS TO SYMPTOMS SEVERE ENOUGH THAT THEY PREVENT INDIVIDUALS WITH ASD FROM LIVING INDEPENDENTLY. SOCIAL SUPPORT AND EARLY INTERVENTION THERAPIES HOWEVER CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AMELIORATE THE SEVERITY OF SEVERAL ASD SYMPTOMS. NOTABLY, THE YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE WHEN THERAPIES AND INTERVENTIONS ARE BEGUN, THE MORE EFFECTIVE THEY WILL ULTIMATELY BE. WHILE CHILDREN CAN BE RELIABLY DIAGNOSED WITH ASD AT AS YOUNG AS 18 MONTHS, THE AVERAGE AGE AT TIME OF DIAGNOSIS IS 4.5 YEARS WHICH MEANS THAT CHILDREN WITH ASD OFTEN MISS THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR LACK OF A DIAGNOSES. DELAYED DIAGNOSES ARE ESPECIALLY COMMON IN CHILDREN FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES. RESEARCH THAT INVESTIGATED POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR DELAYED ASD DIAGNOSES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES FOUND LACK OF PARENTAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ASD, HESITANCY AMONG CLINICIANS TO DIAGNOSE YOUNG CHILDREN WITH ASD, AND A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING STEPS TO TAKE TO HAVE A CHILD TESTED FOR ASD TO BE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS.

DATA PLAY AN INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF EFFECTIVE PREDICTIVE MODELS. THE GREATEST, YET UNDERSTUDIED, CHALLENGE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THESE TOOLS ARISES FROM A DATA-RELATED CONCERN, NAMELY DATASET SHIFT, IN WHICH TRAINING DATA DISTRIBUTION DIFFERS FROM THE POPULATION ON WHICH THE ALGORITHM IS DEPLOYED, LEADING TO MODEL DETERIORATION AND INACCURATE RISK PREDICTIONS. DATASET SHIFT IS A PERVASIVE CAUSE OF ALGORITHMIC UNRELIABILITY IN EHR-BASED MODELS DUE TO INEVITABLE CHANGES IN PHYSICIAN BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH SYSTEM OPERATIONS THAT ALTER (1) THE INPUT DISTRIBUTION (COVARIATE DRIFT); AND (2) CHANGES IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREDICTORS AND OUTCOME (CONCEPT DRIFT). SUDDEN CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC MAY HAVE IMPACTED THE DATA GENERATION PROCESS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF CLINICAL PREDICTIVE MODELS. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDY SHOWED THAT DECREASED COLLECTION OF PATIENT LABS DURING THE COVID-19 QUARANTINE PERIOD LED TO SPARSE DATA GENERATION FOR IMPORTANT PREDICTORS OF A SINGLE-INSTITUTION EHR-BASED MORTALITY RISK PREDICTION ALGORITHM, UNDERPREDICTING RISK FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CANCERS. DESPITE THE INCREASING USE OF PREDICTIVE TOOLS IN HIGH STAKES CLINICAL APPLICATIONS; AND GROWING RECOGNITION OF DATASET SHIFT, WE LACK A FRAMEWORK FOR REASONING SHIFT AND ITS EFFECTS ON CARE DELIVERY; AND FOR PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING SHIFT TO MAINTAIN PERFORMANCE OVER TIME. IN AIM 1, WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND PRIOR WORKS ON SHIFT TO A NATIONALLY DEPLOYED RISK PREDICTION ALGORITHM, THE VA CARE ASSESSMENT NEED (CAN) MODEL, USED ON MILLIONS OF VA BENEFICIARIES EACH YEAR. THE VA CAN MODEL PREDICTS THE LIKELIHOOD OF HOSPITALIZATION WITHIN 90 DAYS OR 1 YEAR AFTER A PRIMARY CARE ENCOUNTER TO IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK PATIENTS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL OUTPATIENT INTERVENTIONS. WE ALSO INVESTIGATE COVARIATE AND CONCEPT DRIFT AS TWO POSSIBLE MECHANISMS FOR COVID-19 ASSOCIATED DATASET SHIFT. IN AIM 2, WE APPLY AN INTERRUPTED TIME SERIES DESIGN TO STUDY THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SUDDEN SHIFT AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC ON CASE-MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.

IN AIM 3, WE CONSIDER REVISION OF THE VA CAN MODEL VIA MACHINE LEARNING AND INCLUSION OF VARIABLES THAT REFLECT POTENTIAL DRIVERS OF SHIFT.

RESEARCHERS CAN GAIN A GLIMPSE INTO THIS FUNCTION THROUGH THE STUDY OF A PROTEIN\u2019S MECHANISM AND DYNAMICS. IDEALLY, A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF A PROTEIN IN BIOPHYSICAL INTERACTIONS WOULD DESCRIBE THE ENTIRE MECHANISTIC PATHWAY ON AN ATOMISTIC AND DYNAMIC LEVEL.

ADVERSE EVENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LONGER HOSPITAL STAY, HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS, AND HIGHER MORTALITY. THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR ADVERSE EVENT SURVEILLANCE, BUT THE STANDARDS OF MANUAL CHART REVIEW AND VOLUNTARY REPORTING ARE TIME-CONSUMING AND UNSUSTAINABLE. VOLUNTARY REPORTING ALSO MISSES MOST ADVERSE EVENT CASES. THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) CAPTURES MEDICAL DATA FOR THE MAJORITY OF US PATIENTS AND PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SUSTAINABLE ADVERSE EVENT SURVEILLANCE VIA AUTOMATED STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE TWO BARRIERS TO AUTOMATING ADVERSE EVENT SURVEILLANCE. FIRST, ADVERSE EVENTS ARE POORLY REPRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASE (ICD) DIAGNOSIS CODES. THIS HAS INHIBITED EFFORTS TO USE SIMPLE RULES-BASED CODE OR FLAG/TRIGGER APPROACHES, WHILE COMPLEX AND HIGH-PERFORMING TEXT-MINING APPROACHES ARE THWARTED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF ADAPTING THEM TO OTHER HEALTHCARE SITES AND LARGE DATA NETWORKS FOR WIDER SURVEILLANCE. SECOND, TEMPORAL INFORMATION IN THE EHR INHERENT TO ADVERSE EVENT TIMING AND SEQUENCING IS CHALLENGING TO CAPTURE. THE CHALLENGES TO EXISTING APPROACHES INCLUDE \u2013 TREATMENT OF RELATED MEDICAL CONCEPTS AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES, THE RAPID EXPLOSION OF DATA INHIBITING SCALING TO LARGE NUMBERS OF MEDICAL CONCEPTS, AND HUMAN INTERPRETABILITY. OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO EXPAND ON EXISTING BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS TOOLS TO BETTER CAPTURE ADVERSE EVENTS AND MORE COMPREHENSIVELY REPRESENT THE FULL PATIENT MEDICAL TRAJECTORY TO IDENTIFY ARCHETYPES OF ADVERSE EVENT DEVELOPMENT.

TOWARDS THIS GOAL OF CONSTRUCTING SUCH A MAP, MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONSORTIA SUCH AS THE HUMAN CELL ATLAS (HCA) AND THE HUMAN BIOMOLECULAR ATLAS PROGRAM (HUBMAP) HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES FOR PROFILING THE TRANSCRIPTOME AND PROTEOME IN SINGLE CELLS. OUT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES, METHODS FOR SINGLE-CELL SPATIAL PROTEOMICS HAVE ONLY VERY RECENTLY BEEN DEVELOPED; FOR EXAMPLE, RECENT ADVANCES IN MULTIPLEXED IMAGING HAVE ENABLED THE PROFILING OF TENS TO HUNDREDS OF PROTEINS PER CELL. WHILE THE GENERATION OF SINGLE-CELL SPATIAL PROTEOMICS DATA PROMISE TO REVOLUTIONIZE OUR ABILITY TO STUDY CELL-CELL INTERACTIONS, IT ALSO RAISES SEVERAL COMPUTATIONAL AND MODELING CHALLENGES. CELL SEGMENTATION REMAINS A LONG-STANDING PROBLEM THAT USUALLY REQUIRES TAILORED SOLUTIONS FOR EACH BIOIMAGING EXPERIMENT. EVEN AFTER CELLS ARE SEGMENTED, USING EXPRESSION VALUES TO INFER CELL TYPE AND ORGANIZATION IS CHALLENGING.

ADDITIONALLY, THESE METHODS ARE ASSOCIATIVE, AND ARE THUS INCAPABLE OF TEASING OUT THE COMPLEX CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG FEATURES IN THE DATASET. DIRECTED CAUSAL GRAPHICAL MODELS (DCGMS) ARE A POWERFUL TOOL FOR FILLING THIS GAP. DCGMS, LEARNED FROM OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS, CAN REPRESENT CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES.

THERE IS EVIDENCE THE NUMBER OF AVOIDABLE COMPLICATIONS MAY BE UNDERREPORTED, THAT APPROXIMATELY 39% OF IN-HOSPITAL ADVERSE EVENTS ARE SURGICAL RELATED, AND THAT AS MANY AS 4,000 SURGICAL NEVER EVENTS (EVENTS WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED) HAPPEN IN THE US EACH YEAR. THE EVENTUAL GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AN AUTOMATED DETECTION SYSTEM (ADS) OF HIGH- RISK SURGICAL STATES. THE ADS WILL PREVENT SURGICAL SAFETY INCIDENTS BEFORE THEY OCCUR THROUGH REAL-TIME MONITORING AND NOTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATE OPERATING ROOM (OR) TEAM MEMBERS AHEAD- OF-TIME IF THERE IS A LOOMING RISK. THEREBY ALLOWING THE TEAM TO RECONSIDER NEXT STEPS AND ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES, AND HENCE REDUCE THE RATES OF NEGATIVE SURGICAL OUTCOMES. THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THE FEASIBILITY AND MERIT OF ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS FOR AN ADS. SPECIFICALLY, THE SURGICAL SAFETY LITERATURE PROVIDES COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT SURGICAL WORK-FLOW DISRUPTION (FD) SEQUENCES ARE INFORMATIVE INDICATORS OF ERROR CAUSATION, THEREFORE IT IS LIKELY THAT A FUTURE ADS WILL MODEL AND MONITOR SURGICAL STATE THROUGH TRACKING FLOW DISRUPTIONS. OUR CURRENT AIMS ARE TO (1) FINISH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESEARCH & EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS DRIVEN TIME-DATA VISUALIZATION (READ-TV) RESEARCH TOOL; OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE TO VISUALIZE FD PATTERNS AND OTHER LONGITUDINAL DATA. (2) DEVELOP A STOCHASTIC MODEL TO PREDICT WHETHER HIGH-RISK, DISRUPTIVE FD SEQUENCES WILL OCCUR BASED ON FD RATES AT EARLIER TIME POINTS. (3) LINK FD PATTERNS AND SEQUENCES WITH SURGICAL OUTCOMES BY DEVELOPING A TEXT CLASSIFIER TO IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT A SURGICAL SAFETY INCIDENT OR NEAR-MISS OCCURRED BASED ON THE ASSOCIATED EHR NOTE. THE CLASSIFIER WILL BE A DEEP LEARNING MODEL TRAINED WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SURGICAL EHR NOTES. THE TEXT ANALYSIS IN THE THIRD AIM WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT TO FD TYPES AND SEQUENCES THAT ARE MORE ERROR PRONE, THEREBY REVEALING THE FD PATTERNS THAT AN ADS SHOULD WARN AN OR TEAM TO AVOID. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF THIS TEXT ANALYSIS INCLUDE A POSSIBLE CONFIRMATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF INCIDENT UNDERREPORTING. UPON COMPLETION OF THE 3 AIMS, WE WILL HAVE A COMPUTATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR AN ADS: OUR RESEARCH TOOL (AIM 1: READ-TV VISUALIZATION SOFTWARE) AND ANALYSES (AIM 3: LINK FLOW DISRUPTIONS TO SAFETY INCIDENTS THROUGH EHR NOTE ANALYSIS) WILL ADVANCE INTERPRETATION OF FLOW DISRUPTION (FD) SEQUENCES, AND OUR STOCHASTIC MODELS (AIM 2: PREDICT FUTURE SURGICAL STATE FROM FD SEQUENCES) WILL PROSPECTIVELY PREDICT ERROR-PRONE STATES. THIS FOUNDATION CAN BE EXTENDED IN FUTURE PROJECTS THROUGH RESEARCH IN AUTOMATIC TRANSCRIPTION OF FLOW DISRUPTIONS, AND THE PROPER MODE OF ALERT DELIVERY IF THE SURGERY IS PRONE TO ENTER AN ERROR-PRONE STATE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id":
