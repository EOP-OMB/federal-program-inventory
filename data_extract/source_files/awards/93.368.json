THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH INITIATIVE TO FUND NUTRITION FOR PRECISION HEALTH (NPH), POWERED BY THE ALL OF US RESEARCH PROGRAM, WILL ENABLE MAJOR PROGRESS IN THE FIELD OF PRECISION NUTRITION. HERE WE PROPOSE NUTRITION FOR PRECISION HEALTH: THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL CLINICAL CENTER (UNC-CC). BECAUSE CHRONIC INFLAMMATION PROMOTES THE PATHOGENESIS OF A WIDE RANGE OF DISEASES, INCLUDING OBESITY, TYPE 2 DIABETES, AND CARDIOVASCULAR, NEOPLASTIC, AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS, WE DRAW UPON THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDITERRANEAN DIET AS A VIABLE STRATEGY TO IMPROVE SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AND REDUCE RISK FOR MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND THEIR COMPLICATIONS. A BODY OF LITERATURE HAS EMERGED THAT DEMONSTRATES BOTH GENOTYPICALLY- AND PHENOTYPICALLY-DRIVEN DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES TO THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET RELATIVE TO A RANGE OF OUTCOMES. OUR PROPOSAL WILL ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEED TO UNDERSTAND VARIABILITY IN PHYSIOLOGIC RESPONSES TO DIET, ANCHORED BY THE THEME OF INFLAMMATION.

THE STANFORD BREAST METASTASIS CENTER (SBMC) IS FOCUSED ON (1) QUANTIFYING THE TIMING OF METASTATIC DISSEMINATION IN BREAST CANCER (2) FUNCTIONALLY DELINEATING THE CONTRIBUTION OF CELLULAR AND MICROENVIRONMENTAL CROSSTALK ON METASTATIC PROCLIVITY, AND (3) CHARACTERIZING THE MECHANISMS OF RESPONSES BY METASTATIC CELLS TO THERAPIES.

HOWEVER, CURRENTLY AVAILABLE PGX ALGORITHMS HAVE CRITICAL LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING A LACK OF GENERALIZABILITY TO NON-WHITE POPULATIONS AND A FAILURE TO ACCOUNT FOR 50 PERCENT OF VARIABILITY IN WARFARIN DOSE. UNDER-REPRESENTATION IN CLINICAL STUDIES, THE PROPENSITY TO CAUSE ADVERSE EVENTS, AND A LACK OF CONSIDERATION OF ADMIXED POPULATIONS IN CLINICAL PGX GUIDELINES ARE ALL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO LIMITED UTILITY OF WARFARIN PGX ALGORITHMS IN DIVERSE POPULATIONS. MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES OF WARFARIN STABLE DOSE VARIABILITY REMAIN CRITICALLY UNEXPLORED, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF VITAMIN K BIOSYNTHESIZING BACTERIAL SPECIES, THE INFLUENCE OF LOCAL ANCESTRY AT WARFARIN PHARMACOGENES, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO ENABLE ACCURATE WARFARIN DOSING ALGORITHMS IN DIVERSE POPULATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS THAT WARFARIN STABLE DOSE PREDICTION CAN BE IMPROVED BY INCORPORATION OF GUT MICROBIOME DATA, MEASURES OF LOCAL ANCESTRY, AND MACHINE LEARNING IN DIVERSE POPULATIONS. WE WILL PURSUE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS (SAS) TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS: (SA1) DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF ABUNDANCE OF VITAMIN K BIOSYNTHESIZING BACTERIA FROM THE GUT MICROBIOME ON WARFARIN STABLE DOSE AND; (SA2) DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF LOCAL ADMIXTURE ON WARFARIN STABLE DOSE IN ADMIXED POPULATIONS; (SA3) OPTIMIZE WARFARIN PGX ALGORITHMS FOR DIVERSE POPULATIONS USING MACHINE LEARNING. IN SA#1, WE WILL CONDUCT A CLINICAL STUDY WITH FECAL SAMPLE COLLECTION AT ANTICOAGULATION CLINIC VISITS AND PERFORM WHOLE GENOME BACTERIAL SEQUENCING TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECT OF VITAMIN K BIOSYNTHESIZING BACTERIAL SPECIES ON WARFARIN STABLE DOSE. IN SA#2, WE WILL ESTIMATE AFRICAN, EUROPEAN, AND NATIVE AMERICAN LOCAL ANCESTRY IN WARFARIN PHARMACOGENES IN A LARGE, ADMIXED POPULATION (N=1194) AND DETERMINE ITS EFFECTS ON WARFARIN STABLE DOSE. IN SA#3, A LARGE, DIVERSE POPULATION OF WARFARIN TREATED PATIENTS (N=7366) WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP MACHINE LEARNING MODELS AND TEST IMPROVED PREDICTION OF WARFARIN STABLE DOSE OVER EXISTING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. OUR STUDIES OVERCOME MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF PREVIOUS WARFARIN PGX STUDIES BY LEVERAGING GUT MICROBIOME DATA, LOCAL ANCESTRY, MACHINE LEARNING, AND DIVERSE, ADMIXED POPULATIONS. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR LOCAL ANCESTRY INVESTIGATION WITH OTHER PGX DRUG-GENE PAIRS, ENABLING USE OF CLINICAL PGX GUIDELINES IN ADMIXED POPULATIONS.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE CLINICAL VALIDITY OF GENETIC VARIANTS THAT ARE COMMON IN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS FROM HISTORICALLY-EXCLUDED POPULATIONS (E.G., LOWER PROPORTIONS OF EUROPEAN GENETIC ANCESTRY), BUT RARE IN WELLREPRESENTED STUDY POPULATIONS REMAINS UNKNOWN. IN ADDITION, GENE EXPRESSION STUDIES HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED INSIGHT INTO THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY OF DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY FOR NUMEROUS CONDITIONS BEYOND WHAT GENOME WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDY (GWAS) RESULTS ALONE HAVE DISCOVERED, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY APPLIED TO STUDIES OF PHARMACOGENOMIC DISCOVERY. FURTHERMORE, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH MAY IMPACT PHARMACOLOGICAL DRUG RESPONSE FROM A BIOLOGICAL STANDPOINT EVEN AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECTS OF THESE FACTORS ON DRUG ADHERENCE, ACCESS, AND UTILIZATION (E.G. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF EPIGENETICS).

THE RARE SLEEP DISORDERS NARCOLEPSY AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM SLEEP WAKE DISORDERS FACE LARGE HURDLES TO DIAGNOSIS, WHERE 20% OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ARE UNAWARE THAT SLEEP MEDICINE EXISTS AS A SPECIALTY, ROUTINE SCREENING FOR SLEEP DISORDERS IS NEARLY ABSENT, DIAGNOSTIC TESTS REQUIRE OVERNIGHT VISITS TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF SPECIALIZED CLINICS, AND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR COMMON DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IS NON-EXISTENT.

IN YEAR ONE, WE WILL ADVANCE DESIGN RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCE DESIGN INITIATIVES THAT FOCUS ON HOLISTIC EXPERIENCE STRATEGIES FOR [I] PARTICIPANTS AND [II] RESEARCHERS.

TO DO THIS, A CORE OBJECTIVE WILL BE DESIGNING PATHWAYS THAT CENTER ON PARTICIPANT CHOICE. OUR MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVES WILL ENSURE THAT PARTICIPANTS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ENTER THROUGH DV OR HPO PATHWAYS, HAVE A SMOOTH AND ENGAGING EXPERIENCE THROUGH JOINING, CONSENTING, AND STAYING INVOLVED.

AS THE PROGRAM HAS BUILT AN INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENROLL PARTICIPANTS, COLLECT DATA, CURATE INFORMATION, AND FACILITATE PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS AND BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION (PM&B), HCM HAS BEEN A VITAL PARTNER SINCE THE BEGINNING. WE HAVE BUILT A ROBUST ENGAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE TO REACH, EDUCATE, AND MOTIVATE INDIVIDUALS FROM COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN RESEARCH (UBR) TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. OUR ENGAGEMENT APPROACH IS GROUNDED IN BEST PRACTICES AND FUELED BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IMPACTFUL ENGAGEMENT REQUIRES YOU TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE \u2013 NOT ONLY WHERE THEY LIVE, WORK, AND PLAY, BUT ALSO WHERE THEY ARE ALONG THEIR ENGAGEMENT JOURNEY. THIS JOURNEY BEGINS WITH AWARENESS, MOVES TOWARDS ENROLLMENT, AND NUTURES ONGOING PARTICIPATION IN THE ALL OF US RESEARCH PROGRAM. TO ENABLE SUSTAINED, IMPACTFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS, WE HAVE BUILT RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY INFLUENCERS BASED UPON TRUST, TRANSPARENCY, AND BIDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION \u2013 THE SAME CORE VALUES CENTRAL TO THE ALL OF US RESEARCH PROGRAM. WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. DEEP RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS KEY COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LEVERAGED AND COMMUNITY-ENGAGED APPROACHES USED TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND DELIVER TOOLS AND EXPERIENCES FOR MULTIPLE AUDIENCES. ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS HAVE BEEN TRACKED TO INFORM THE ITERATION PROCESS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES. IMPACT AND SCALE HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO LOCALIZE THE PROGRAM. THROUGH OUR TRUSTED PARTNERSHIPS, WE HAVE BROUGHT THE ALL OF US RESEARCH PROGRAM TO NEIGHBORHOODS, COLLEGE CAMPUSES, CHURCHES, PROFESSIONAL CONFERENCES, FESTIVALS, AND OTHER VENUES WHERE POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS LIVE, WORK, AND PLAY. HCM HAS BUILT, NURTURED, AND ENGAGED A NATIONAL NETWORK OF 1,214 ORGANIZATIONS. OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS RESULTED IN 902 OF THEM UNDERTAKING AT LEAST ONE LEARNING ACTIVITY ABOUT ALL OF US. WE CREATED THE OPPORTUNITIES, TOOLS, AND TRAININGS THAT RESULTED IN 412 OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS TAKING THE NEXT STEPS TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR COMMUNITY IN AT LEAST ONE ACTIVITY, WHICH IS A 46.7 PERCENT ACTIVATION RATE. WHERE WE ARE GOING. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF ALL OF US, MOTIVATE INDIVIDUALS TO ENROLL, ENGAGE WITH PARTICIPANTS TO RETAIN THEM OVER A DECADE OR MORE, AND NURTURE AN ECOSYSTEM OF RESEARCHERS HUNGRY TO USE THE DATA. THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE ENGAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE HOUSED IN THE NEW ENGAGEMENT INNOVATION NETWORK (NETWORK) AND FUELED BY A NEW ENGAGEMENT INCUBATOR (EI). THE EI WILL PROVIDE A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRUCTURE THAT EMPLOYS COMMUNITY-BASED AND PARTICIPATORY-ENGAGEMENT APPROACHES TO DEVELOP EXPERIENCES FOR MULTIPLE AUDIENCES THAT CAN BE DELIVERED IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS, WHICH ARE REPLICABLE AND SCALABLE.
