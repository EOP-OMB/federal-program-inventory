EXISTING TEEN PREGNANCY PREVENTION (TPP) PROGRAMMING IS NOT TAILORED TO THESE POPULATIONS. PARTICULARLY, THE ROLE OF TRAUMA IN YOUTH\u2019S PERSONAL LIVES, THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM, AND EXPERIENCES WITH STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION ARE NOT INTEGRATED INTO EXISTING TPP PROGRAMMING. CHOOSING MYSELF IS AN INNOVATIVE, THEORY-AND EVIDENCE-INFORMED, INCLUSIVE, COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HEALTH PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR JUSTICE-INVOLVED AND MARGINALIZED YOUTH. IT STEMS FROM A STRENGTHS-BASED APPROACH THAT CENTERS THE NEEDS, GOALS, VALUES, AND LIVED EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPANTS. THIS PROGRAM ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION (E.G., RACISM, MISOGYNY, HOMOPHOBIA, TRANSPHOBIA, ABLEISM) AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (E.G., HOUSING, FOOD) WHICH INFLUENCE YOUTH\u2019S DECISION-MAKING. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO SCALE UP AND CONDUCT A PROCESS/IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION OF CHOOSING MYSELF. THIS 24-MONTH PROJECT CONSISTS OF THREE PHASES OF ITERATIVE PROGRAMMING AND EVALUATION AND WILL REACH 200 JUSTICE-INVOLVED YOUTH(AGES 13-18), BOTH IN/OUT OF RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES ACROSS TWO STATES (FLORIDA AND GEORGIA). EACH COHORT (CLASS) WILL CONSIST OF 12-SESSIONS OF 8-10 YOUTH. THIS USER-CENTERED, QUALITY IMPROVEMENT APPROACH ENGAGES CURRENT PARTICIPANTS, A YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD (YAB) (FORMER PARTICIPANTS), AND PROGRAM FACILITATORS TO ELICIT CRITICAL FEEDBACK TO EVALUATE AND REFINE PROGRAM COMPONENTS AFTER EACH PHASE. THE PROGRAM AND EVALUATION ARE TRULY PARTICIPANT-CENTERED, WITH ALL ACTIVITIES BEING INFORMED BY THE COMMUNITY. THIS MIXED-METHOD FORMATIVE EVALUATION WILL USE QUANTITATIVE/QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED VIA EVALUATION TOOLS: PARTICIPANT PRE-POST/FOLLOW-UP SURVEYS, DAILY BEHAVIOR LOGS; PARTICIPANT/FACILITATOR FOCUS GROUPS; FACILITATOR/OBS ERVER ATTENDANCE, FIDELITY, AND QUALITY LOGS; AND PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION (E.G., PROJECT TEAM AND YAB MEETING NOTES ABOUT PROGRAM MODIFICATIONS, LESSONS LEARNED; COMMUNITY SITE DESCRIPTIONS). DATA WILL EXAMINE WHETHER PROGRAM ADHERES TO KEY COMPONENTS (E.G., TRAUMA-INFORMED, SAFE/INCLUSIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT), ALIGNS WITH BEST PRACTICES IN TPP, AND IS IMPLEMENTED WITH FIDELITY. WE WILL ALSO STUDY IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES (ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, FEASIBILITY, PARTICIPANT-CENTEREDNESS) AND BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. FINALLY, THE EVALUATION WILL PROVIDE PRELIMINARY DATA TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE PROGRAM IS PRODUCING PROMISING IMPACTS ON SHORT-(KNOWLEDGE, SELF-EFFICACY, OUTCOME EXPECTATIONS, BARRIERS/OPPORTUNITIES, BEHAVIORAL SKILLS, INTENTIONS) AND INTERMEDIATE-(DECREASE NONCONSENSUAL AND PHYSICALLY/PSYCHOLOGICAL VIOLENT SEX, CORRECT/CONSISTENT CONDOM/CONTRACEPTIVE USE, INCREASE ACCESS TO SEXUAL HEALTHCARE) TERM OUTCOMES, WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REDUCING UNINTENDED PREGNANCY, STIS, AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE. THE ACADEMIC-COMMUNITY MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM INCLUDES RESEARCHERS, PRACTITIONERS, AND YOUTH WITH METHODOLOGICAL, PROGRAMMATIC, AND LIVED EXPERIENCE/EXPERTISE (E.G., TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE; GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE; SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION; PROGRAM EVALUATION; IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE)AND IS DEDICATED AND QUALIFIED TO FULFILL THE PROJECT\u2019S GOALS AND ACTIVITIES.

POLICIES RELATED TO SCHOOL-BASED SEX EDUCATION ARE OFTEN FORMULATED AT THE STATE LEVEL AND MAY IMPACT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TEENAGE PREGNANCY PREVENTION EFFORTS. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT VARIATIONS IN THE CONTENT OF THESE POLICIES AFFECT SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIORS AND SUBSEQUENT TEENAGE BIRTH AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION (STI) RATES.

THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO LONGITUDINALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF STATE-LEVEL SCHOOL-BASED SEX EDUCATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES ON ADOLESCENT SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIORS AND SEXUAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE WILL CONDUCT SECONDARY DATA ANALYSES USING A NOVEL COMBINATION AND INTEGRATION OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE REPORTS AND DATASETS MERGING EXISTING STATE-LEVEL, SCHOOL-LEVEL, AND INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DATA FROM 2001 TO THE PRESENT. STATE POLICY VARIABLES FROM THE GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE AND THE SEXUALITY INFORMATION AND EDUCATION COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES WILL INCLUDE SEX EDUCATION MANDATES AND CONTENT REQUIREMENTS.

OUR LONGITUDINAL ANALYSES WILL INCLUDE A) DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES APPROACHES TO COMPARE EACH STATE TO ITSELF AND OTHER STATES PRIOR TO AND AFTER POLICY CHANGES; B) STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING TO EXAMINE WHETHER SEX EDUCATION PRACTICES MEDIATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEX EDUCATION POLICIES AND YOUTH SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIORS AND ADVERSE SEXUAL HEALTH OUTCOMES; AND C) MULTILEVEL MODELING TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN STATE-LEVEL POLICIES AND OUTCOMES, SCHOOL-LEVEL PRACTICES, AND INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL BEHAVIORS. RESULTS OF THE PROJECT WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE FIELD OF TEENAGE PREGNANCY PREVENTION BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT STATE EDUCATION POLICYMAKERS, SCHOOL DISTRICTS, PRINCIPALS, AND TEACHERS CAN USE AS THEY DELIBERATE HOW BEST TO TEACH SEX EDUCATION.
