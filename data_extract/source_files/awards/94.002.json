THE MILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM CONTRIBUTES TO THE ONGOING EDUCATION OF ITS CONSTITUENTS BY PROVIDING ONSITE HISTORY AND STEM LEARNING EXPERIENCES THROUGH A WIDE RANGE OF LEARNING METHODS INCLUDING REMOTE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. WITH ITS MISSION-BASED FOCUS ON EDUCATION, THE MUSEUM HAS A FORMED A COLLABORATION WITH THE CHARLOTTE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOCUSED ON ONE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S FOUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES: IMPROVE THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN US HISTORY IN GRADES 5-12. WITH ALMOST 72% OF THE STUDENTS CLASSIFIED AS ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND 23% PERFORMING UNDER THE MINIMAL STATE STANDARDS FOR US HISTORY, THE NEED WAS EVIDENT AND THE MUSEUM WAS WELL POSITIONED TO ALIGN ITS SERVICES AND LEVERAGE ITS CAPABILITIES TO MEET THIS NEED. \n\nTHE MILITARY HERITAGE MUSEUM HAS LOTS OF ARTIFACTS, INTER-ACTIVE ACTIVITIES, A 247-SEAT THEATER, AS WELL AS AUDIO-VIDEO, VIRTUAL REALITY AND SIMULATORS THROUGH-OUT ITS FACILITY.

DURING THE DESIGNING OF THE NEW LOCATION'S BUSINESS PLAN, THE IMPORTANCE OF REACHING OUT TO STUDENTS WAS ELEVATED AS ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES. THE CONCEPT OF LEVERAGING THE LARGE CORPS OF VOLUNTEER VETERANS TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT'S GOALS, ESPECIALLY IN US HISTORY, WAS FULLY ENDORSED BY THE MUSEUM'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. PRIOR TO OPENING THE MUSEUM IN ITS NEW LOCATION, DIALOGUE TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE MUSEUM AND SCHOOL DISTRICT PERSONNEL TO ENVISION THE POSSIBILITIES. THE DISCUSSIONS LED TO THE CREATION OF HISTORY ACADEMY, OF WHICH THE PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL BASED PROGRAMMING TO STUDENTS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON US HISTORY.

THE SECOND, A READING PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES CLASSROOM SUPPORT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, PLACES VOLUNTEER \"READING BUDDIES\" IN CLASSROOMS TO READ TO CHILDREN IN SMALL GROUP SETTINGS ON A WEEKLY BASIS THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR.

THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS FOCUS AREA IS FRAIL, HOMEBOUND, ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED OLDER ADULTS.

NEW MEXICO?S POPULATION IS ETHNICALLY AND CULTURALLY DIVERSE, WITH LARGE HISPANIC, ANGLO AND NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN POPULATIONS. OVER A THIRD OF THE STATE?S POPULATION IS NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING; THE PREDOMINANT OTHER LANGUAGES ARE SPANISH, DINE (NAVAJO) AND PUEBLO DIALECTS. NEW MEXICO?S AGING POPULATION IS GROWING RAPIDLY. BY THE YEAR 2030, NEW MEXICO?S POPULATION OF PERSONS AGE 60 AND OLDER IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE BY 70%. BY THE YEAR 2030, 32.5% OF NEW MEXICO POPULATION WILL RANK 3RD IN THE NATION IN PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION AGE 60 OR OLDER. THE 85+ POPULATION WILL BE MORE THAN TRIPLE FROM 23,306 IN 2000 TO 75,629 IN 2030. IN NEW MEXICO 15% OF THE POPULATION 60 OR OLDER LIVE AT OR BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL; 17% LIVE AT 125% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.  NEW MEXICO?S GROWING POPULATION OF OLDER ADULTS REFLECTS THE AGING OF ITS BABY BOOMERS, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUING MIGRATION OF RETIREES AND OTHERS TO WESTERN STATES. THIS STATE CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE INCREASING DEMANDS FOR SERVICES FROM PERSONS WITH LOW INCOMES. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL FOUNDATION TO END SENIOR HUNGER, MORE THAN 42,300 NEW MEXICANS AGE 60 OR OLDER ARE FOOD INSECURE. THESE SENIORS ARE NOT SURE THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY FOOD; AND MANY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT. THUS, THE PROBLEMS OF HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY IN NEW MEXICO ARE MAJOR.

(APIA) HAS DEVELOPED AND SUCCEEDED IN BUILDING AND GROWING THIS RSVP PROGRAM FOR THE ANCHORAGE AND MATANUSKA-SUSITNA BOROUGH DURING THE PREVIOUS THREE YEARS. WITHIN THESE FIRST THREE YEARS, APIA?S NEW RSVP PROGRAM HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON BUILDING A STRONG PROGRAM FROM THE GROUND UP, RECRUITING VOLUNTEERS, BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS, FOSTERING AND MAINTAINING LONGEVITY WITH RSVP VOLUNTEERS AND LISTENING AND ADAPTING TO THE CHANGING COMMUNITY NEEDS. THE APIA RSVP PROGRAM IS EAGER TO SHAPE THIS PROGRAM WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEAR CYCLE AND DIVE DEEPER INTO MEETING THE MOST CRITICAL COMMUNITY NEEDS WHILE FOCUSING OUR RSVP VOLUNTEERS, STATIONS AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES ACCORDING TO THOSE EXPRESSED COMMUNITY NEEDS. \nTHE STATE OF ALASKA HAS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING SENIOR POPULATIONS IN THE NATION. ACCORDING TO THE FY2016 ANNUAL REPORT: ALASKA'S ROADMAP TO SUCCESSFUL AGING, WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED BY THE STATE OF ALASKA COMMISSION ON AGING, THE 65 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER SENIOR COHORT HAS INCREASED BY 61.5% FROM 2004 TO 2014. WITHIN A 6 YEAR PERIOD FROM 2010 TO 2016 THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE OF 30.5% INCREASE IN POPULATION FOR THE SENIORS AGE 60 TO 64. IN ADDITION TO THOSE STAGGERING INCREASES THE 85 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER SENIOR COHORT HAS INCREASED BY 33.3% FROM THE YEARS 2010 TO 2016. ECONOMIC AND POPULATION ANALYSTS' CONTINUE TO PROJECT LARGE INCREASES IN THE SENIOR POPULATION IN THE FUTURE AS THE \"BABY BOOMER\" GENERATIONS COME OF AGE.\nIN ALASKA, THE STATE APPROVED LONG-TERM CARE/ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY, THE PIONEER HOME, HAD A WAITLIST OF 368 APPLICANTS IN 2016. IN ADDITION TO THE LACK OF SENIOR HOUSING OPTIONS, ALASKA HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST MEDIAN COSTS FOR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY CARE. CONSIDERING THAT THE AVERAGE MONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENT FOR ALASKA SENIORS AGE 65 AND OLDER WAS ONLY $1,306 IN DECEMBER OF 2016 THIS LEAVES A LARGE GAP OF SENIORS UNABLE TO PAY FOR ASSISTED LIVING HOME CARE. SENIORS THAT FALL WITHIN THIS FINANCIAL GAP RELY ON SENIOR INDEPENDENT LIVING AND SUPPORTS TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCY.  APIA WILL BE REDIRECTING EFFORTS INTO SUPPORTING SENIORS BY FOCUSING 76 RSVP VOLUNTEERS IN OUTCOME ASSIGNMENTS AND 8 ADDITIONAL VOLUNTEERS PLACED WITHIN THE PRIMARY FOCUS AREA OF HEALTHY FUTURES AND OTHER FOCUS AREAS, FOR A TOTAL OF 84 RSVP VOLUNTEERS FOR THIS PROJECT.
