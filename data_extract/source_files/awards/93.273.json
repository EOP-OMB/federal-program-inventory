ALCOHOL DOSE-DEPENDENTLY INDUCES ACM, CHARACTERIZED BY PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION IN MYOCARDIAL CONTRACTILITY AND VENTRICULAR DILATATION, CULMINATING IN HEART FAILURE. AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL, CHRONIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION RESULTS IN CARDIOMYOCYTE DEATH, CARDIAC INFLAMMATION, AND CARDIAC FIBROSIS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO FDA-APPROVED THERAPIES FOR ACM. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ADVANCE EMODIN, A SMALL MOLECULE NATURAL COMPOUND WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANTI-APOPTOTIC, AND ANTI-FIBROTIC ACTIVITIES, FOR ACM PREVENTION OR TREATMENT. WE HAVE GENERATED A ROBUST BODY OF BACKGROUND DATA IN THE BASIC SCIENCE AND EARLY DISCOVERY PHASE THAT SUPPORTS EMODIN AS A NOVEL THERAPY FOR ACM INCLUDING: 1) TGFSS SIGNALING IS THE PRIMARY UNDERLYING MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR ALCOHOL-INDUCED CARDIAC FIBROSIS, A KEY COMPONENT OF ACM PATHOGENESIS, 2) EMODIN IS AN EFFECTIVE INHIBITOR OF TGFSS CANONICAL AND NON-CANONICAL SIGNALING IN MULTIPLE CELL TYPES, 3) THE PHARMACOKINETICS (PK) AND EXCELLENT SAFETY OF EMODIN HAVE BEEN EXAMINED IN MURINE MODELS, AND 4) AT NON- TOXIC ORAL DOSES, EMODIN EFFECTIVELY AMELIORATES CARDIAC FIBROSIS AND DYSFUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH DOXORUBICIN, A PATHOLOGY SIMILAR TO ACM. FURTHERMORE, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA ILLUSTRATES THAT EMODIN ATTENUATES ALCOHOL-INDUCED LOSS OF CARDIOMYOCYTE VIABILITY AND ACTIVATION OF CARDIAC FIBROBLASTS. WE PROPOSE TO FURTHER TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT EMODIN CAN BE DEVELOPED AS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE AND/OR THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR ACM. IN THIS PHASE 1 STTR APPLICATION, WE PROPOSE TO EXAMINE THE PK, SAFETY, AND EFFICACY OF EMODIN IN CHRONIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION RODENT MODELS AND PERFORM A PK AND TOXICITY STUDY IN PIGS IN THE FOLLOWING THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. SA1. TO TEST IF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION INFLUENCES EMODIN METABOLISM AND EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF EMODIN IN AMELIORATING ACM IN MOUSE MODELS. SA2. TO EXAMINE THE PK, SAFETY, AND EFFICACY OF EMODIN IN REDUCING CARDIAC FIBROSIS AND CARDIAC DYSFUNCTION IN ALCOHOL-FED RATS IN BOTH PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SETTINGS. SA3.TO PERFORM A PK AND SAFETY STUDY OF EMODIN IN PIGS AND FIND A SAFE DOSE RANGE THAT MAY ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE BLOOD EMODIN CONCENTRATIONS. BY THE END OF THE FUNDING PERIOD OF THIS STTR PHASE 1 APPLICATION, WE WILL POSSIBLY MOVE EMODIN TOWARDS THE NEXT PHASE OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT: IND-ENABLING PRECLINICAL STUDY. MILESTONES FOR A GO/NO-GO DECISION INCLUDE: 1) IF EMODIN DOES NOT EXAGGERATE ALCOHOL-INDUCED TOXICITIES IN MICE AND RATS, PARTICULARLY LIVER TOXICITY; 2) IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT EFFICACY OF EMODIN IN AMELIORATING ACM IN MICE AND RATS; AND 3) IF AN APPROPRIATE SAFE DOSE IS IDENTIFIED IN PIGS THAT CAN BE EXTRAPOLATED TO HUMANS. IF ANSWERS TO THE ABOVE THREE QUESTIONS ARE POSITIVE, THE DECISION WILL BE MADE TO FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF EMODIN, AND A PHASE II APPLICATION WILL BE SUBMITTED TO PERFORM AN IND-ENABLING

ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE) IS COMMON AND CAN RESULT IN BRAIN-BASED DISABILITIES AND GROWTH DEFICITS. THE IMPACT OF PAE IS NOT JUST IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT, BUT ALSO CAN LEAD TO SECONDARY HEALTH PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN. THESE SECONDARY PROBLEMS CAN INCLUDE HIGHER RATE AND EARLIER ONSET OF AGING-RELATED DISEASES, INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS SUCH AS ARTHRITIS, AND DECREASED BONE DENSITY. THE EARLY ONSET OF THESE AGING-RELATED DISEASES INDICATES THAT A CONSEQUENCE OF PAE IS PREMATURE AGING OF TISSUES AND ORGANS. THERE IS AN UNMET NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS PAE-INDUCED PREMATURE AGING AND DETERMINE THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS THAT COULD BE LEVERAGED TO DELAY OR PREVENT THESE SECONDARY HEALTH CONDITIONS. WE KNOW THAT PAE IS A POTENT TERATOGEN THAT REPROGRAMS STEM CELLS. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THIS STEM CELL REPROGRAMMING HAS LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING THE PREMATURE AGING OF STEM CELLS AS A MECHANISM THAT DRIVES SYSTEMIC AGING. THIS HYPOTHESIS IS SUPPORTED BY PUBLISHED LITERATURE THAT SHOWS PAE CAN DISRUPT STEM CELL SELF-RENEWAL, DUE, IN PART, TO PREMATURE OR ABERRANT DIFFERENTIATION, AND THAT THESE DISRUPTED STEM CELL BEHAVIORS PERSIST INTO ADULTHOOD. BASED ON THESE DATA, WE PLAN TO ADDRESS TWO QUESTIONS: FIRSTLY, \u201cDOES PAE IN HUMAN POPULATIONS DIMINISH STEM CELL FUNCTION ACROSS THE LIFESPAN?\u201d; SECONDLY, \u201cDOES PAE INDUCE OR EXACERBATE HUMAN STEM CELL AGING?\u201d. TO ADDRESS THE ABOVE TWO QUESTIONS, WE PLAN TO CREATE HUMAN INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS (HIPSCS), AS EARLY PASSAGES OF THESE CELLS RETAIN EPIGENETIC MARKERS OF AGING. THESE CELLS WILL BE DERIVED FROM REGIONALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE NEONATAL, CHILD/ADOLESCENT, AND ADULT COHORTS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH PAE/FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS (FASDS) AND FROM MATCHED CONTROLS.

TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE TREATMENT CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT A CHILD\u2019S DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY AND PREVENT SECONDARY DISABILITIES.

THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON THE NUTRIENT CHOLINE, A ONE-CARBON DONOR THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR HEALTHY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. POLYMORPHISMS IN CHOLINE-METABOLIZING GENES AFFECT ITS SYNTHESIS, TRANSPORT, AND UTILIZATION, AND THUS AFFECT CHOLINE NEED AND EFFICACY OF ITS USE. STRONG PRECLINICAL DATA SHOW THAT CHOLINE SUPPLEMENTATION \u2013 BOTH IN UTERO AND POSTNATALLY \u2013 MITIGATES THE COGNITIVE DEFICITS DUE TO PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE). CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE MORE NUANCED OUTCOMES, AND CHOLINE SUPPLEMENTS CONFER MORE MODEST OR EVEN NO BENEFIT; HOWEVER, VARIABLES INCLUDING AGE, DEVELOPMENTAL BRAIN STAGE, AND DURATION CONFOUND THE INTERPRETATION. OUR RECENT SNP ANALYSIS OF SUBJECTS IN THE WOZNIAK INTERVENTION FOUND THAT POLYMORPHISMS IN THE CHOLINE TRANSPORTER SLC44A1 (CTL1) PREDICT WHO BENEFITED MOST FROM CHOLINE; SPECIFICALLY, SUBJECTS HAVING MINOR ALLELES IN SLC44A1 HAVE THE GREATEST MEMORY IMPROVEMENT WHEN GIVEN SUPPLEMENTAL CHOLINE. SLC44A1 IS UBIQUITOUS AND ITS ACTIVITY IS REDUCED BY LOW CHOLINE INTAKE, AND THESE MINOR ALLELES FURTHER REDUCE ITS ACTIVITY. THUS, THOSE WITH THE MINOR ALLELES ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE TO CHOLINE INADEQUACY AND BENEFIT MOST FROM ITS SUPPLEMENTATION. HERE, WE COLLABORATE WITH CIFASD INVESTIGATORS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF SLC44A1 IN FASD. SPECIFICALLY, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT POLYMORPHISMS IN SLC44A1 SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES IN FASD, IN BOTH THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF CHOLINE INTERVENTION. AIM 1 TESTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT, WITHIN THE UKRAINIAN INTERVENTION TRIAL, THOSE PAE PREGNANCIES WITH MINOR ALLELES IN SLC44A1 DERIVE THE GREATEST COGNITIVE BENEFIT FROM CHOLINE SUPPLEMENTATION.

WITH AN ECONOMIC BURDEN ESTIMATED AT ~$250 BILLION/YEAR. CURRENT PHARMACOLOGIC AND BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS OF AUD HAVE LIMITED EFFICACY, AND DESPITE INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF AUD, THE RELAPSE RATE HAS NOT IMPROVED OVER THE PAST 50 YEARS (~55% WITHIN 6 MONTHS). THUS, IDENTIFYING NOVEL AND MORE EFFICACIOUS TREATMENTS TO PREVENT RELAPSE IS AN URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY. THIS NEED IS ESPECIALLY ACUTE FOR PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED LIVER DISEASE (ALD), FOR WHOM CONTINUED ALCOHOL USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH MORTALITY AND WITHHOLDING OF TRANSPLANTATION. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE AIM TO TEST A NOVEL TREATMENT APPROACH FOR SEVERE AND REFRACTORY AUD: NEUROMODULATION OF THE REWARD CIRCUIT WITH DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION (DBS) OF THE LIMBIC PALLIDUM (LP). WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT LP DBS PREVENTS RELAPSE TO ALCOHOL USE BY REDUCING CRAVING AND MODULATING BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH VULNERABILITY TO RELAPSE LIKE CUE REACTIVITY, REWARD PROCESSING, AND IMPULSIVITY. WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS BY CONDUCTING AN INITIAL PILOT STUDY TO TEST SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY OF LP DBS IN 3 PATIENTS WITH SEVERE AUD AND CONCOMITANT ADVANCED COMPENSATED (ASYMPTOMATIC) ALD (UG3 PHASE). UPON MEETING THE UG3 PHASE MILESTONES, WE WILL CONDUCT A DOUBLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED, SHAM-CONTROLLED TRIAL TO FURTHER TEST SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY, AND TO ASSESS PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF LP DBS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE AUD (UH3 PHASE). FOR THE UH3 PHASE, WE WILL ENROLL 20 PATIENTS WITH SEVERE AUD AND CONCOMITANT ADVANCED COMPENSATED ALD. IN BOTH THE UG3 AND UH3 PHASES, WE WILL ASSESS ALCOHOL USE AND CRAVING PRE- AND POST- DBS AT MULTIPLE TIME POINTS. WE WILL ALSO ASSESS TARGET ENGAGEMENT AND THE EFFECTS OF LP DBS ON ALCOHOL- INDUCED CHANGES IN THE REWARD CIRCUITRY USING PET SCANS AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGY.

THERE ARE NO CURRENT THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE CELLULAR DYSFUNCTION AND SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE THAT LEADS TO PROGRESSIVE ORGAN FAILURE MEDIATED BY MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION AND OXIDATIVE STRESS BY DIRECT ALCOHOL-MEDIATED TOXICITY.

NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (NAD+) IS A HALLMARK OF AGING-RELATED DISEASE FOR THE LIVER AND KIDNEY. DECREASED LEVELS AND IMPAIRED SYNTHESIS OF NAD+ ARE FOUND IN ALD ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASED DE NOVO LIPOGENESIS AND IMPAIRED MITOCHONDRIAL OXIDATION MADE POSSIBLE BY THE ROLE OF ALCOHOL IN NAD+ DEPLETION AND IMPAIRED CELLULAR FUNCTION. NAD+ SUPPLEMENTATION WITH THE NAD+ PRECURSOR NICOTINAMIDE RIBOSIDE (NR) REVERSES ALCOHOL-INDUCED CHANGES BY INCREASING NAD+ LEVELS IN TISSUE CULTURE, ENHANCING MITOCHONDRIAL OXIDATION, MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS, AND GENE EXPRESSION.

IN THE UNITED STATES A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS (FASD) IN FIRST-GRADE CHILDREN WAS 1-5% (MAY ET AL., 2018). THESE NUMBERS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE, GIVEN THE SLIGHT BUT STEADY RISE IN ALCOHOL USE AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN (DENNY, ACERO, TERPLAN, & KIM, 2020). NIAAA ESTABLISHED THE COLLABORATIVE INITIATIVE ON THE FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS (CIFASD) TO INFORM AND DEVELOP EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS AND TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR FASD THROUGH A HIGHLY INTEGRATED, MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROGRAM INVOLVING BASIC SCIENTISTS AND CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS.

THIS PROJECT FUNCTIONS AS A CORE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SET OUT TO TEST A SPECIFIC OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS, BUT RATHER, IT SERVES THE CONSORTIUM BY CODIFYING DATA AMONG THE COMPONENTS. ACCOMPLISHING THIS WILL BRING US CLOSER TO THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF GENERATING IMPACTFUL HYPOTHESES THAT DESCRIBE HOW STRESS AND ALCOHOL ACT AS AN ANTECEDENT FOR AN AUD.  EACH OF THE PARTICIPATING RESEARCH COMPONENTS WILL GENERATE LARGE, COMPLEX DATA SETS.

PRECLINICAL STUDIES FROM THE INIASTRESS CONSORTIUM THAT EXAMINED CHRONIC ETHANOL-STRESS INTERACTIONS IN MICE HAVE DEMONSTRATED ELEVATIONS IN ETHANOL DRINKING, COGNITIVE DEFICITS, METAPLASTIC ADAPTATIONS, AND EMERGENCE OF NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE BEHAVIORS. THE INIASTRESS INVESTIGATORS ALSO PERFORMED MECHANISTIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDIES THAT REVEALED KEY BIOLOGICAL TARGETS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DRIVING THESE ABERRANT BEHAVIORS IN STRESSED, CHRONIC INTERMITTENT ETHANOL (CIE) EXPOSED MICE. HOWEVER, THE BRAIN-WIDE NEURAL ADAPTATIONS PRODUCED BY ETHANOL-STRESS INTERACTIONS ARE UNKNOWN, AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE BRAIN-WIDE ACTIVITY PATTERNS THAT UNDERLIE ALCOHOL AND STRESS INTERACTIONS WILL LEAD TO EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH ALCOHOL USE DISORDER. RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN BRAIN-WIDE MAPPING AND INNOVATIVE NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE STATISTICAL APPROACHES PROMPTED THE FORMATION OF THE CIE-STRESS MOUSE BRAIN ACTIVITY MAPPING CORE (BAMC). IN THIS APPLICATION, WE PROVIDE PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWING WHOLE-BRAIN LIGHT SHEET IMAGING OF C-FOS EXPRESSION AND FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MAPPING IN CIE-FSS TREATED MICE AND IN MICE DRINKING IN THE INTERMITTENT ACCESS MODEL. THUS, THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE BAMC ARE TO 1) APPLY CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY IN WHOLE- BRAIN LIGHT SHEET IMAGING AND EXPERTISE IN NETWORK ANALYSES TO PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS IN THE INIASTRESS CONSORTIUM AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WITH NOVEL BRAIN REGIONS, CIRCUITS, AND NETWORKS THAT DRIVE INCREASED DRINKING IN MICE WITH A HISTORY OF FORCED SWIM STRESS (FSS) AND CIE EXPOSURE, AND 2) PROVIDE BRAIN-WIDE SIGNATURES OF IMMEDIATE EARLY GENE (IEG) ACTIVITY IN RESPONSE TO PHARMACOLOGICAL AGENTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO REDUCE THE EXCESSIVE DRINKING PHENOTYPE IN STRESS, ETHANOL DEPENDENT MICE. THE SECONDARY GOALS OF THE BAMC ARE TO 1) PROVIDE THE WHOLE- BRAIN MAPPING DATA TO THE COMPUTATIONAL AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS CORE (CSAC) FOR INTEGRATION WITH ADDITIONAL NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL DATA COLLECTED ACROSS ALL COMPONENTS, AND 2) PERFORM CROSS-INIA CONSORTIA ANALYSES OF WHOLE-BRAIN IEG EXPRESSION. IN AIM 1, THE BAMC WILL GENERATE WHOLE-BRAIN IEG MAPPING DATA USING THE STANDARD INIASTRESS CONSORTIUM MODEL OF STRESS-INDUCED EXCESSIVE DRINKING FOR INIASTRESS INVESTIGATORS AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. STUDIES IN AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE BRAIN-WIDE IEG SIGNATURES AFTER PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF DRUGS THAT REDUCE DRINKING IN THE CIE-FSS MODEL. BY APPLYING CUTTING-EDGE LIGHT SHEET IMAGING, ADVANCED NETWORK ANALYSIS, AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERROGATION OF IEG EXPRESSION ACROSS THE WHOLE MOUSE BRAIN USING A RELIABLE MODEL THAT RESULTS IN ESCALATED VOLUNTARY ETHANOL INTAKE IN STRESSED, ETHANOL DEPENDENT MICE, THE BAMC WILL HELP TO GENERATE NEW HYPOTHESES AND UNBIASED INSIGHTS INTO SYSTEMS AND CIRCUITRY UNDERLYING ALCOHOL-STRESS INTERACTIONS.

CIRCUIT FUNCTION AND BEHAVIOR - PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL \u201cWHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF GLIAL CELLS IN NEURAL CENTERS? THE ANSWER IS STILL NOT KNOWN, AND IT MAY REMAIN UNSOLVED FOR MANY YEARS TO COME UNTIL SCIENTISTS FIND DIRECT METHODS TO ATTACK IT.\u201d (RAMON Y CAJAL, 1901). THIS PROPHECY TURNED OUT TO BE ACCURATE. ASTROCYTES, ONE OF THE MOST ABUNDANT CELL TYPES IN THE BRAIN, HAVE LONG BEEN THOUGHT OF AS PRIMARILY PASSIVE SUPPORT CELLS. OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, STUDIES INDICATE THAT ASTROCYTES PLAY PIVOTAL ROLES IN NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT, FUNCTION, AND DISEASES. HOWEVER, A MAJOR UNRESOLVED ISSUE IN NEUROSCIENCE IS HOW ASTROCYTES INTEGRATE DIVERSE NEURONAL SIGNALS UNDER HEALTHY CONDITIONS, MODULATE NEURAL CIRCUIT STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AT MULTIPLE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES, AND HOW ABERRANT EXCITATION AND MOLECULAR OUTPUT INFLUENCES SENSORIMOTOR BEHAVIOR AND CONTRIBUTES TO DISEASE. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS U19 TEAM-RESEARCH BRAIN CIRCUIT PROGRAM PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THIS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE BY DEVELOPING A DEEPER MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF ASTROCYTES\u2019 ROLES IN NEURAL CIRCUIT OPERATION, COMPLEX BEHAVIORS, AND BRAIN COMPUTATION THEORIES. TWO OVERARCHING QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED: 1) HOW DO ASTROCYTES TEMPORALLY AND SPATIALLY INTEGRATE MOLECULAR SIGNALS FROM THE DIVERSE TYPES OF LOCAL AND PROJECTION NEURONS ACTIVATED DURING SENSORIMOTOR BEHAVIORS. 2) HOW DO ASTROCYTES CONVERT THIS INFORMATION INTO FUNCTIONAL OUTPUTS THAT MODULATE NEURAL CIRCUIT STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. A MULTIDISCIPLINARY, COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT IS PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS THAT CAN ONLY BE COMPLETED THROUGH CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN RESEARCHERS WITH UNIQUE AND COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE. AN INNOVATIVE MULTI-SCALE APPROACH INTEGRATING FUNCTIONAL, ANATOMICAL, AND GENETIC ANALYSES WITH THEORETICAL MODELING WILL BE LEVERAGED. THIS APPROACH INVOLVES QUANTITATIVE BEHAVIORAL ASSAYS, LARGE-SCALE IMAGING OF CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS, TARGETED CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC MANIPULATIONS, HIGH- THROUGHPUT OMIC TECHNIQUES, GENETIC PROFILING, PROTEIN ENGINEERING, MACHINE LEARNING, AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELING. BY INTEGRATING EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL APPROACHES, MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND CIRCUIT MECHANISMS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH WHICH ASTROCYTES INFLUENCE NEURAL CIRCUITS AND CONTRIBUTE TO COMPLEX BEHAVIORS AND BRAIN COMPUTATION THEORIES.

WITKIEWITZ AND M. KARNO, MPIS) AND IS IN RESPONSE TO PA-18-648, NIH SUPPORT FOR CONFERENCES AND SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS. THE ONGOING U13 PROJECT HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING ITS AIMS, AND THE MOBC SATELLITE MEETING CONTINUES TO BE A CENTRALIZED VENUE FOR ALCOHOL RESEARCHERS, MOBC RESEARCHERS, AND CROSS-DISCIPLINARY SCIENCE OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE (SOBC) RESEARCHERS TO CONVENE, NETWORK, AND DISSEMINATE MOBC SCIENCE. DURING THE U13 PROJECT PERIOD, THE FIELD HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE REGARDING MOBC IN ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG USE DISORDERS. ACCORDINGLY, THIS FOLLOW-UP APPLICATION IS FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE MOBC MEETING. SPECIFICALLY, WE REQUEST FUNDING FOR THREE ANNUAL, ONE-DAY SATELLITE MEETINGS HELD AT THE SITE OF THE RESEARCH SOCIETY ON ALCOHOLISM CONFERENCE. IN THE PROPOSED ITERATION, WE WILL CONTINUE THE IMPORTANT WORK OF THE MOBC SATELLITE WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING ANOTHER AREA OF NIAAA PRIORITY: DISSEMINATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE. THE APPLICATION\u2019S SPECIFIC AIMS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1) TO PROVIDE A FORUM FOR DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION (D&I) AND MOBC RESEARCHERS TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF COMPATIBILITY IN THESE TWO FIELDS OF STUDY; 2) TO PROVIDE CLEAR DEFINITIONAL PARAMETERS FOR EACH FIELD OF STUDY AS A FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING A PLAN FOR SCIENTIFIC INTEGRATION; 3) TO OUTLINE METHODOLOGICAL GUIDELINES FOR EACH FIELD OF STUDY, AS WELL AS FOR THE EMERGING FIELD TARGETING THEIR INTEGRATION; AND 4) TO OFFER AN ONGOING VENUE SUPPORTING A DIVERSE GROUP OF STUDENTS, POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS, AND ALL CAREER-STAGE RESEARCHERS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PUSH THE SCIENCE OF MOBC INTO KEY AREAS OF SCIENTIFIC PRIORITY AT NIAAA (E.G., D&I; SEE ALSO NOT-AA-19-010). CONSISTENT WITH PAST MOBC CONFERENCES, THE SATELLITE MEETINGS WILL FEATURE AN INTERACTIVE PROGRAM THAT THE MPIS WILL CREATE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A DESIGNATED PLANNING COMMITTEE.

THESE ELECTRODE ARRAYS INCLUDE THOUSANDS OF ELECTRODES THAT CAN BE USED FOR BOTH RECORDING AND STIMULATION, ENABLING STUDIES THAT REQUIRE RECORDINGS FROM MULTIPLE, LARGE CORTICAL REGIONS IN RODENTS AND NON-HUMAN PRIMATES (NHP) AT CELLULAR SCALE. THE ELECTRODE ARRAYS ARE EXTREMELY THIN (<25 \u039cM) AND FLEXIBLE, AND ARE MADE IN BOTH NON-PENETRATING AND 3D PENETRATING CONFIGURATIONS, OF WHICH THE LATTER WILL BE FORMED FROM A SIMPLE AND UNIQUE ROLLING OF 2D SOFT ELECTRODE ARRAY (ROSE) METHOD. AMPLIFIERS AND MULTIPLEXERS INTEGRATED DIRECTLY INTO THE ELECTRODE ARRAY, USING COMMERCIALLY FABRICATED SILICON TRANSISTORS, INTELLIGENTLY COMBINE SIGNALS INSIDE THE ARRAY SO THAT RECORDING FROM UP TO 4,096 ELECTRODES IS POSSIBLE WITH FEWER THAN 20 MULTIPLEXED EXTERNAL WIRE CONNECTIONS. THE SMALL NUMBER OF INTERFACE WIRES FACILITATES LONG-TERM EXPERIMENTS IN CHRONICALLY-IMPLANTED, FREELY-BEHAVING ANIMALS AND EASES FUTURE WIRELESS INTEGRATION. THE ELECTRODE ARRAYS WILL BE MANUFACTURED IN LARGE QUANTITIES (3800 DEVICES / RUN) USING FULL WAFERS AT X-FAB. BY LEVERAGING A COST-EFFECTIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, THE RAW MATERIALS COST OF EACH ELECTRODE ARRAY WILL BE ~$10, EXCLUDING POST PROCESSING LABOR WHICH WILL BE SUPPLIED BY THIS PROGRAM.  OUR DISSEMINATION PROGRAM WILL MAKE DEVICE BROADLY AVAILABLE TO A LARGE COHORT OF END USERS. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DISSEMINATED EARLY-STAGE TECHNOLOGY TO ~10 LABS ARE NOW SCALING UP TO DISSEMINATE THAT TECHNOLOGY TO ~100 LABS. BASED ON FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED DURING THIS DISSEMINATION EFFORT, NEURAL INTERFACES WITH HIGH SNR AND 3-DIMENSIONAL MEASUREMENT ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH, MOTIVATING THIS PROJECT. WE WILL DISSEMINATE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY TO AT LEAST 10 LABS IN THIS EFFORT, SOLICITED FROM THE NEUROSCIENCE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. WE WILL SOLICIT END USER FEEDBACK THROUGH A WORKSHOP AT THE SOCIETY FOR NEUROSCIENCE (SFN) MEETING AND USE THIS FEEDBACK TO SHAPE OUR DEVICE DESIGNS.  THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ENABLE BRAIN INITIATIVE INVESTIGATORS AND THE BROADER NEUROSCIENCE COMMUNITY TO PERFORM VERY LARGE-SCALE RECORDINGS IN ANIMAL MODELS. FURTHER, THE RESEARCH ENABLED BY THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL BE ABLE TO BE RAPIDLY TRANSLATED TO HUMANS IN THE FUTURE, THROUGH PARALLEL, SEPARATELY-FUNDED EFFORTS BY OUR TEAM TO BRING ACTIVELY-MULTIPLEXED ELECTRODE ARRAYS TO HUMAN USE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id":

THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESES OF THIS APPLICATION ARE THAT (1) THE CREATION OF A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS WILL FACILITATE THE GENERATION OF NOVEL PREDICTION MODELS BASED ON THE CLINICAL, BEHAVIORAL, METABOLIC, AND BIOMARKER DATA WE COLLECT TO PREDICT CLINICAL DECOMPENSATION, (2) THIS COHORT CAN VALIDATE AND THEN BE SUPPLEMENTED BY A LARGER ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR)-BASED VIRTUAL COHORT, THE LATTER OF WHICH WILL ENABLE VALIDATION OF ELECTRONIC CIRRHOSIS PHENOTYPES AND SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS OF REAL-WORLD DATA ON THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INDIVIDUAL LIPID-LOWERING AGENTS ON MULTIPLE OUTCOMES AMONG PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS AND (3) LONG-TERM STATIN THERAPY WILL PROVIDE CLINICAL BENEFITS IN PREVENTING HEPATIC DECOMPENSATION AND HCC INDEPENDENT OF ITS LIPID LOWERING EFFECT. TO INVESTIGATE THESE HYPOTHESES, WE PROPOSE UNIQUE APPROACHES TO BOTH THE COHORT STUDY AND STATIN-BASED CLINICAL TRIAL FOR THE LIVER CIRRHOSIS NETWORK (LCN). IN AIM 1A, WE WILL CREATE A PROSPECTIVE COHORT OF HIGHLY PHENOTYPED PATIENTS WITH COMPENSATED NASH, ALD, CHOLESTATIC AND CRYPTOGENIC CIRRHOSIS, IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE INTERROGATION OF BIOSPECIMENS, PATIENT REPORTED BEHAVIORS AND OUTCOMES, AND CLINICAL DATA FOR NOVEL PREDICTORS OF DISEASE PROGRESSION, AND TO UNDERSTAND THROUGH SERUM LIPOPROTEINS MEASUREMENT THE COMPLEX INTERACTION BETWEEN CIRRHOSIS AND LIPID METABOLISM. IN AIM 1B, WE WILL CREATE A LARGE LCN-WIDE EHR-BASED VIRTUAL COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS, PROSPECTIVELY VALIDATE ELECTRONIC PHENOTYPES FOR CIRRHOSIS AND ITS CLINICAL COMPLICATIONS WITH OUR IN-PERSON COHORT, AND EVALUATE THE USE, SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF LIPID LOWERING MEDICATIONS UPON OUTCOMES IN THIS LARGE REAL-WORLD VIRTUAL COHORT.

THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO THE STATIN-BASED CLINICAL TRIAL WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE PATIENT'S BASELINE INDICATION FOR LIPID-LOWERING THERAPY, AND OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE LIPID LOWERING PATHWAY IN PCSK9 INHIBITION, WHICH HAS SIMILAR OR GREATER LDL-LOWERING POTENCY BUT LACKS THE PLEOTROPIC EFFECTS OF STATINS, TO ALLOW FOR NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO MECHANISMS BY WHICH STATINS MIGHT IMPACT OUTCOMES INDEPENDENT OF ITS EFFECTS ON LIPIDS. THROUGHOUT THE COHORT AND INTERVENTIONAL TRIALS, WE WILL STUDY LIPOPROTEIN METABOLISM, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, AND COLLECT MICROBIOME AND BIOSPECIMENS FOR FUTURE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS BEHIND DISEASE PROGRESSION IN CIRRHOSIS AND FOR ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PRAVASTATIN AND ALIROCUMAB ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES.

STABLE COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE TO PREVENT PROGRESSION TO DECOMPENSATION AND THEREBY REDUCE LIVER-RELATED DEATHS. TWO STAGES OF COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS ARE RECOGNIZED; WITH STAGE 2 IDENTIFIED BY THE PRESENCE OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PORTAL HYPERTENSION (CSPH, DEFINED BY HEPATIC VENOUS PRESSURE GRADIENT OF 10 MMHG OR HIGHER). STATINS ARE A NOVEL DRUG CLASS FOR CONSIDERATION IN TREATMENT OF CIRRHOSIS AS PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW REDUCTIONS IN BOTH PORTAL HYPERTENSION AND IMPROVED SURVIVAL AND OFFER PROMISE AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN STAGE 2 COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS. THIS MULTICENTER STUDY WILL ESTABLISH A PROSPECTIVE COHORT OF 2000 PATIENTS WITH COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS AND CSPH FOR LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP OF CHANGES IN CLINICAL, LIFESTYLE, LABORATORY, AND IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS COMBINED WITH A RICH BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION FOR FUTURE TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES.

CIRRHOSIS HAS DOUBLED IN PREVALENCE IN THE LAST DECADE AND IS NOW THE 11TH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES. THE NUMBER OF CIRRHOSIS-RELATED DEATHS IS PROJECTED TO TRIPLE BY 2030, WITH NASH PROJECTED TO OVERTAKE HCV AS THE LEADING CAUSE OF LIVER TRANSPLANTATIONS. SEVERE LIMITS ON THE NUMBER OF LIVER TRANSPLANTATIONS PERFORMED EACH YEAR AND ANTICIPATED INCREASES IN THE CIRRHOSIS PATIENT POPULATION CREATE AN URGENT NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND PREDICTORS OF MORTALITY IN CIRRHOSIS AND DEVELOP EFFECTIVE THERAPIES TO TREAT CIRRHOSIS. STUDIES FROM OUR GROUP AND OTHERS SUGGEST STATINS MAY REDUCE FUTURE RISK OF HCC AND DECOMPENSATION IN PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS. AMONG STATINS, LIPOPHILIC STATINS SUCH AS ATORVASTATIN HAVE SHOWN THE GREATEST CHEMOPREVENTIVE EFFECTS AGAINST HCC OCCURRENCE. ATORVASTATIN IS ASSOCIATED WITH DOSE-DEPENDENT REDUCTION IN INCIDENT CIRRHOSIS IN HCV PATIENTS. DATA SUPPORTING STATIN USE FOR CIRRHOSIS ARE PROMISING, BUT LARGER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT) ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MAY BE ROUTINELY RECOMMENDED. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE CIRRHOSIS PATIENT POPULATION, THIS RESEARCH PLAN PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING AIMS: AIM 1: TO CONDUCT A PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL, MULTICENTER, MULTI-ETHNIC COHORT STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS. AMONG HISPANIC MEN, CIRRHOSIS IS THE 6TH LEADING CAUSE OF MORTALITY. TO ADDRESS THIS HEALTH DISPARITY, WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT HISPANIC PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR HEPATIC DECOMPENSATION COMPARED TO NON-HISPANICS. WE WILL ESTABLISH AND MONITOR A COHORT OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE CIRRHOSIS DUE TO MULTIPLE ETIOLOGIES. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS INCLUDE (A) A COMPOSITE ENDPOINT OF HEPATIC DECOMPENSATION, (B) LIVER TRANSPLANTATION, OR (C) ALL\u2013CAUSE MORTALITY. ANCILLARY STUDIES WILL INVESTIGATE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN NON-INVASIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS, CIRRHOSIS GENETIC RISK SCORE, AND RISK OF DECOMPENSATION. FOLLOWING UP ON OUR PREVIOUS WORK, WE WILL ALSO IDENTIFY A MICROBIOME SIGNATURE THAT MAY PREDICT DECOMPENSATION RISK. AIM 2: PHASE 2, MULTI-CENTER, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RCT EVALUATING EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF ATORVASTATIN 20 MG IN SUBJECTS WITH COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ATORVASTATIN IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PLACEBO IN REDUCING RISK OF DECOMPENSATION, ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY AND OTHER LIVER-RELATED CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN CIRRHOSIS PATIENTS.

MALADAPTIVE EXPERIENCES EARLY IN LIFE CAN ALTER DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES, LEADING TO HARMFUL AND ENDURING DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUELAE. PRE- AND POSTNATAL HAZARDS INCLUDE MATERNAL SUBSTANCE EXPOSURE, TOXICANT EXPOSURES IN PREGNANCY AND EARLY LIFE, MATERNAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, PARENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, MALTREATMENT, STRUCTURAL RACISM, AND EXCESSIVE STRESS. TO ELUCIDATE HOW VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS IMPACT CHILD DEVELOPMENT, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT A NORMATIVE TEMPLATE OF DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OVER THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF LIFE BE ESTABLISHED BASED ON A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE SAMPLE OF THE US POPULATION. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE HEALTHY BRAIN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL CONSORTIUM (HBCD-NC) HAS BEEN FORMED TO DEPLOY A HARMONIZED, OPTIMIZED, AND INNOVATIVE SET OF NEUROIMAGING (MRI, EEG) MEASURES COMPLEMENTED BY AN EXTENSIVE BATTERY OF BEHAVIORAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOLS, AND BIOSPECIMENS TO UNDERSTAND NEURODEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES IN A SAMPLE OF 7,500 MOTHERS AND INFANTS ENROLLED AT 24 SITES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES (US).

IN A PILOT STUDY (N=318) CONDUCTED BY OUR U.S.-RUSIAN TEAM AT THE IRKUTSK REGIONAL MATERNITY HOSPITAL (RMH), 59% OF WOMEN TESTED POSITIVE FOR ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AS ASSESSED BY A LABORATORY-CONFIRMED ALCOHOL BIOMARKER (PETH). THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL ADAPT AN EFFECTIVE ALCOHOL REDUCTION INTERVENTION EVALUATED IN RUSSIA AMONG NON-PREGNANT ALCOHOL-USING WOMEN TO OPTIMIZE ITS EFFICACY FOR ALCOHOL-USING WOMEN IN PRENATAL CARE. WE PROPOSE TO IMPLEMENT A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (N=720) TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF THE ALCOHOL REDUCTION INTERVENTION, RELATIVE TO STANDARD-OF-CARE, IN (1) REDUCING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN IN PRENATAL CARE, 2) REDUCING POOR BIRTH OUTCOMES, AND 3) REDUCING INFANTS\u2019 ALCOHOL-RELATED PHYSICAL AND FACIAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND COGNITIVE, MOTOR AND NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES. WE WILL RECRUIT WOMEN AT THEIR FIRST PRENATAL VISIT TO THE IRKUTSK RMH.

WOMEN ARE RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF TWO CONDITIONS: THE INTERVENTION CONDITION, WHICH INCLUDES STANDARD-OF-CARE PLUS THE ALCOHOL REDUCTION INTERVENTION, OR THE COMPARISON CONDITION, WHICH PROVIDES STANDARD-OF-CARE ONLY. IN THE ALCOHOL REDUCTION INTERVENTION, PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE: (1) A COMPUTER-DELIVERED COMPONENT TO ENHANCE KNOWLEDGE, NORMS, AND MOTIVATION FOR ALCOHOL REDUCTION, AND (2) A BRIEF OBSTETRICIAN-DELIVERED COMPONENT REINFORCING THE COMPUTER-DELIVERED CONTENT. THE ALCOHOL REDUCTION INTERVENTION IS THEORY-DRIVEN AND USES MOTIVATIONAL ENHANCEMENT STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE ALCOHOL REDUCTION. THE ALCOHOL REDUCTION INTERVENTION IS DELIVERED TO WOMEN ON THREE OCCASIONS, FOLLOWING THEIR BASELINE, 2ND-TRIMESTER, AND 3RD-TRIMESTER ASSESSMENTS. WOMEN IN THE COMPARISON CONDITION COMPLETE ASSESSMENTS ON THE SAME SCHEDULE. TO ASSESS INFANT BIRTH OUTCOMES, WE WILL ABSTRACT MEDICAL RECORDS SHORTLY AFTER DELIVERY.

CARDIOVASCULAR ABNORMALITIES MAY BE COMMON IN FASD; HOWEVER, COMPREHENSIVE RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES ON LIFETIME CVD RISK IN ADULT PATIENT COHORTS HAVE YET TO BE PERFORMED. CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING FASD-MEDIATED CHD AND CVD ARE ALSO LARGELY UNKNOWN ALONG WITH ANY BIOMARKERS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE PATIENT POPULATION TO BE STRATIFIED BASED ON CVD RISK. HERE WE PRESENT PRELIMINARY DATA FROM OUR RETROSPECTIVE CLINIC COHORT THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT FEMALES WITH FASD HAVE AN OVERALL INCREASE IN CHD, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) RATE, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING DIAGNOSED WITH ANY CVD IN ADULTHOOD. FEMALES WITH FASD ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED EJECTION FRACTION RELATIVE TO MATCHED CONTROLS. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT FASD IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CHD IN NEWBORNS AND CVD IN ADULTS. IN A ZEBRAFISH MODEL OF EMBRYONIC ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (EAE), WE CONFIRMED A PRIMARY DEFECT IN CARDIOMYOCYTE MIGRATION THAT CAUSES SUBSEQUENT FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL HEART ABNORMALITIES, INCLUDING CONTRACTILITY DEFICITS AND VENTRICULAR WALL ABNORMALITIES THAT PERSIST THROUGH ADULTHOOD. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT EAE ZEBRAFISH CAN SERVE AS A MODEL FOR LIFELONG CARDIAC FUNCTION IN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF CHD. WE PROPOSE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS TO TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT FASD PATIENTS HAVE AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CVD AND THAT THE ZEBRAFISH EAE MODEL WILL UNCOVER NOVEL MOLECULAR MEDIATORS AND BIOMARKERS THAT EXPLAIN AND PREDICT CVD RISK. IN SPECIFIC AIM 1, WE WILL PERFORM A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY TO DETERMINE CVD INCIDENCE IN AN ADULT FASD PATIENT COHORT, INCLUDING CHD, HYPERTENSION, CARDIOMYOPATHY, MI, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT, AND EMBOLISM, AS WELL AS THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER METABOLIC AND INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS. IN SPECIFIC AIM 2, WE WILL DEFINE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING EMBRYONIC HEART DEFECTS IN A ZEBRAFISH EAE MODEL BY IDENTIFYING AND FUNCTIONALLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF MOLECULAR ALTERATIONS IN MIGRATORY MYL7+ CARDIOMYOCYTES THAT FORM THE CARDIAC CONE THROUGH HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN (PDGF PATHWAY) AND UNBIASED (BULK RNA-SEQUENCING ON FACS-ISOLATED MYL7+ CARDIOMYOCYTES) APPROACHES.

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES MAY CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN AFFECTED PATIENTS. BY IDENTIFYING WHICH CVD OUTCOMES IMPACT FASD PATIENTS AND WHAT ADDITIONAL METABOLIC AND INFLAMMATORY FACTORS INDICATE RISK, WE WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EARLY INTERVENTION.

VERY FEW TREATMENTS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED DESPITE THE TREMENDOUS PUBLIC HEALTH BURDEN POSED BY FASD. COGNITION IS A NATURAL TARGET FOR INTERVENTION BECAUSE DEFICITS CONTRIBUTE TO PROBLEMS WITH ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING, SOCIAL SKILLS, AND INDEPENDENT LIVING. A DECADE OF RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT COGNITIVE TRAINING HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORKS - MEDIATING COGNITION IN A VARIETY OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE IT CAN IMPROVE COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH FASD. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR EXISTING LINE OF NEUROMODULATION RESEARCH AND THE PROPOSED RCT IS TO LEVERAGE THE ABILITY OF TDCS TO ENHANCE CORTICAL EXCITABILITY AND NEURAL PLASTICITY IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE COGNITIVE TRAINING BENEFITS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH FASD.  RECENTLY WE CARRIED OUT A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF TDCS-AUGMENTED COGNITIVE TRAINING TO DEMONSTRATE THE SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH IN CHILDREN WITH FASD (BORODA, KRUEGER, ET AL., 2020). WE SHOWED THAT THE INTERVENTION WAS SAFE AND WELL-TOLERATED IN THIS POPULATION. FURTHER, DESPITE APPLYING A RELATIVELY LOW-DOSE OF TDCS AND COGNITIVE TRAINING, WE FOUND THAT THE GROUP RECEIVING ACTIVE-TDCS DEMONSTRATED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON AN ATTENTION TASK THAN A GROUP RECEIVING SHAM-TDCS. THESE PROMISING PILOT RESULTS MERIT REPLICATION IN A LARGER CLINICAL TRIAL.  WE PROPOSE A FULLY-POWERED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF 60 (AT COMPLETION) CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH FASD WHO WILL RECEIVE COGNITIVE TRAINING IN COMBINATION WITH TDCS.

AUD IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF BRAIN FUNCTION AND BEHAVIOR, FREQUENTLY PRESENTING WITH COGNITIVE DEFICITS AND COMORBID NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE DISORDERS (E.G., ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION). THESE NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE AND COGNITIVE DISTURBANCES THAT ARE PRESENT DURING ABSTINENCE FROM ALCOHOL DRINKING CAN DRIVE RELAPSE-LIKE BEHAVIORS IN BOTH HUMANS AND RODENT MODELS AND ARE OFTEN EXACERBATED BY STRESS.

THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT CIE-FSS HYPER-RECRUITS CRF IN THE MPFC AND APVT TO PROMOTE EXCESSIVE DRINKING, COGNITIVE DEFICITS, AND ANXIETY-LIKE PHENOTYPES. IN AIM 1, WE WILL IDENTIFY CHRONIC ALCOHOL- AND STRESS-INDUCED CHANGES IN SYNAPTIC AND FUNCTIONAL PLASTICITY THAT OCCUR IN A CRF-DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT MANNER IN MPFC\u00aeNAC AND APVT\u00aeNAC CIRCUITRY. STUDIES IN AIM 2 WILL FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING THE INFLUENCE OF CRF ON MPFC FUNCTION AND CIRCUITRY USING HIGH-DENSITY SILICON NEUROPIXELS PROBES AND FIBER PHOTOMETRY.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN COGNITION AND STRESS REACTIVITY ARE THOUGHT TO DEFINE PHENOTYPES WITHIN THE AUD SPECTRUM WHICH MAY DIFFER IN DISEASE PROGNOSIS AND RESPONSIVITY ACROSS TREATMENT STRATEGIES. AS SUCH, PRECISELY DEFINING THE BEHAVIORAL AND NEUROBIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATES MEDIATING COVARIANCE ACROSS COGNITIVE, STRESS, AND DRINKING DOMAINS IS CRITICAL FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF AUD. HOWEVER, UNTIL RECENTLY WE HAVE LACKED TECHNICAL APPROACHES WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR DETERMINATION OF WHETHER INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN THESE BEHAVIORS ARISE FROM THE SAME NEURONS OR FROM DISTINCT POPULATIONS WITHIN BRAIN REGIONS. TO PARSE HOW THESE PHENOTYPES MANIFEST WE MUST 1) QUANTIFY THE COMPLEX INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES THAT EMERGE AT THE INTERSECTION OF STRESS, ALCOHOL DRINKING, AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND 2) DETERMINE THE PRECISE NEURONS IN THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL THESE INTERACTIONS. TO THIS END, WE WILL FIRST USE DEEP PHENOTYPING OF BOTH BEHAVIORAL AND NEURONAL FEATURES TO COMPUTATIONALLY DEFINE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES ACROSS DOMAINS IN MICE. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX IS A CRITICAL MEDIATOR OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION, RESPONSES TO STRESSORS, AND DRINKING, BUT THE PRECISE DEGREE OF SHARED CIRCUITRY BETWEEN THESE BEHAVIORS IS UNCLEAR. THUS, WE WILL USE A LONGITUDINAL DESIGN TO DEFINE THE NEURONAL PLASTICITY SIGNATURES IN PREFRONTAL CORTEX THAT GOVERN EXPRESSION AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE BEHAVIORS WITHIN THE SAME SUBJECTS.

RESEARCH HAS CERTAINLY NOT ALWAYS BEEN VIEWED BY AIAN PEOPLE AND TRIBES AS A KEY PART OF A HEALING JOURNEY, BUT OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, TRIBES, TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS AND TRIBAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN THE US HAVE BEGUN TO EMERGE AS LEADERS OF THEIR OWN SELF-DETERMINED RESEARCH AGENDAS TO ADDRESS HEALTH PRIORITIES AND ELIMINATE DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES. AIAN COMMUNITIES AND TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS IN WASHINGTON STATE HAVE BEEN LEADING RESEARCH EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES AND RACIAL INEQUITIES IN HEALTH CARE THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH RESEARCH INTENSIVE UNIVERSITIES AND WITH AIAN INVESTIGATORS POSITIONED AT THESE SITES. THE NORTHWEST INDIAN COLLEGE (NWIC) IS THE ONLY ACCREDITED TRIBAL COLLEGE SERVING THE STATES OF WASHINGTON, OREGON AND IDAHO, AND HAS AN ESTABLISHED HISTORY OF PARTNERING TO CONDUCT TRIBALLY OWNED AND CONTROLLED RESEARCH.

CHILDREN WITH AN FASD EXPERIENCE A RANGE OF EFFECTS, INCLUDING DEFICITS IN SENSORY, MOTOR, AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS, WHICH ARE IN TURN RELATED TO POOR LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, FEW EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR CHILDREN WITH AN FASD AND, OF THESE, ONLY TWO TARGET ACADEMIC OR COGNITIVE SKILLS. MUSIC TRAINING (MT) TARGETS A COMPLEX ARRAY OF SKILLS INCLUDING AUDITORY AND VISUAL PERCEPTION, MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION, ATTENTION, AND WORKING MEMORY. THESE MT TARGETS ALIGN WELL WITH THE DEFICITS EXPERIENCED BY CHILDREN WITH FASD AND, THEREFORE, MT MAY BE WELL-SUITED FOR IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR THESE CHILDREN. IN THIS PROJECT, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MT IMPROVES BRAIN FUNCTION AND TARGETED SKILLS VIA IMPROVEMENT IN PREDICTIVE CODING. THE PREDICTIVE CODING FRAMEWORK POSITS THAT A PRIMARY ROLE OF THE BRAIN IS TO PREDICT THE ENVIRONMENT AND OPTIMIZE OUTCOMES THROUGH IDENTIFYING AND CORRECTING PREDICTION ERRORS. MT PROVIDES DIRECT PRACTICE OF PREDICTIVE CODING WHEN PARTICIPANTS REGULARLY PRODUCE SOUNDS (ENVIRONMENT) AND ADJUST THEIR BEHAVIOR TO CORRECT ANY ERRORS (FIX INCORRECT NOTES/TIMING).

RISK FOR AEP IS GREATER AMONG NATIVE AMERICANS, BECAUSE RATES OF UNINTENDED PREGNANCY AND BINGE/HEAVY DRINKING ARE INEQUITABLE BETWEEN NATIVE WOMEN AND THE GENERAL POPULATION. AEP COUNSELING INTERVENTIONS FOR NATIVE WOMEN ARE EFFICACIOUS, BUT TOO COSTLY TO SUSTAIN. DIGITAL INTERVENTIONS INCREASE THE REACH OF EVIDENCE-BASED BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS WHILE REDUCING COST. THIS PROJECT WILL TAILOR AND OPTIMIZE THE FIRST DIGITAL AEP INTERVENTION, CARRII, PILOTED IN A GENERAL POPULATION OF WOMEN WITH AEP RISK, FOR NATIVE WOMEN.

SA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH DISPARITIES, RESULTING IN THE WORLD'S HIGHEST RATE OF FASD (111.1 PER 1,000), WHERE LIFELONG NEGATIVE COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL EFFECTS RESULT FROM PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE. FASD IS COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE IF WOMEN DO NOT DRINK DURING PREGNANCY. PRENATAL ALCOHOL USE FREQUENTLY CO-OCCURS WITH OTHER SUBSTANCE USE, ESPECIALLY TOBACCO AND CANNABIS. THE ADVERSE EFFECT ON BIRTH OUTCOMES BY ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO USE TOGETHER IS WORSE THAN EITHER SUBSTANCE ALONE. RECENT EVIDENCE FROM ANIMAL MODELS SHOWS THAT PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO BOTH CANNABINOIDS AND ALCOHOL POTENTIATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ALCOHOL-INDUCED BIRTH DEFECTS. DATA FROM CAPE METROPOLE, SA, SHOWED THAT ALL WOMEN WHO REPORTED PRENATAL ALCOHOL USE ALSO TESTED POSITIVE FOR TOBACCO USE, WITH 25% ALSO REPORTING CANNABIS USE. ALCOHOL USE WHILE BREASTFEEDING ALSO OCCURS AT A RELATIVELY HIGH RATE IN SA.

WE USED THIS SYSTEM TO RECORD ACTION POTENTIALS FROM ARRAYS OF UP TO 1200 MICROELECTRODES IN RATS (PENETRATING, 1MM DEPTH) AND LOCAL FIELD POTENTIALS FROM >30,000 MICROELECTRODES IN SHEEP (SURFACE). THIS SERVES AS A DEMONSTRATION OF THE MICROWIRE- TO-CMOS BONDING ARCHITECTURE THAT WILL FORM THE CORE OF OUR NEXT DEVICE, A MEDICAL IMPLANT. FOR THIS NEW IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW AND SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED METHOD OF ELECTRODE ARRAY FABRICATION. THIS METHOD PRODUCES MORE ORDERED, REGULAR ARRAYS THROUGH ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE MACHINING (EDM), THUS IMPROVING ON THE STOCHASTIC CONNECTIONS OF THE BUNDLE ARCHITECTURE FROM PHASE I WITH THE ABILITY TO BE PRODUCED UNDER GMP. A NEW, CUSTOM CMOS SENSOR, ALSO DEVELOPED FOLLOWING THE NIH SBIR PHASE I EFFORT, PERFORMS COMPRESSIVE SENSING OF NEURAL DATA TO REDUCE POWER AND DATA REQUIREMENTS IN THE FUTURE DEVICE. AS WE PREPARE TO BUILD THIS IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICE AND TAKE IT TO MARKET, IT IS CRITICAL TO EXTENSIVELY TEST THE INSERTION RELIABILITY OF DIFFERENT ARRAYS DESIGNS IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A DEVICE BEST OPTIMIZED FOR INSERTION AND RECORDING. HERE WE PROPOSE TO USE PASSIVE ARRAYS OF 400-1600 ELECTRODES, SMALLER THAN OUR PHASE I APPROACH, TO FIND THE OPTIMAL ELECTRODE ARRAY DESIGN FOR CLINICAL TRANSLATION. WE WILL TEST ARRAY DESIGNS THAT CAN RELIABLY INSERT INTO THE SHEEP CORTEX, VALIDATE THE INSERTION OF THAT ARRAY IN HUMAN TISSUE INTRAOPERATIVELY (UNDER IRB), AND EVALUATE THE TISSUE RESPONSE TO THE ARRAY OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO 6 MONTHS, IMPLANTED CHRONICALLY IN SHEEP. THE OVERALL GOAL FOR THE FUTURE ARRAY IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN RELIABLY INSERT THE ARRAY WITH THE SMALLEST SHANK WIDTH TO MITIGATE THE CHRONIC FOREIGN BODY RESPONSE AT AN APPROPRIATE PITCH (100 - 400 \u039cM) AND LENGTH (I.E. 1 MM) SUITABLE FOR THE HUMAN CORTEX. MOREOVER, THIS DATA WILL ALSO BE CRITICAL FOR DESIGNING CERTIFIED GLP STUDIES, AND FOR PLANNING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FDA FOR PRE-IDE MEETINGS, WHERE WE WILL NEED A FINALIZED ARRAY DESIGN AND TESTING PLAN IN PLACE. THE AIMS OF THIS DIRECT TO PHASE II STUDY ARE AS FOLLOWS: SPECIFIC AIM (SA) 1: DETERMINE OPTIMAL MICROELECTRODE ARRAY DESIGN AND VALIDATE IMPLANTATION IN SHEEP AND HUMAN CORTICAL TISSUE INTRAOPERATIVELY WITH PASSIVE ARRAYS OF 400-1600 ELECTRODES. WE AIM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE GEOMETRIC PARAMETERS OF HIGH DENSITY MICROWIRE ELECTRODE ARRAYS IMPACT INSERTION RELIABILITY INTO CORTICAL TISSUE IN VIVO IN AN OVINE (SHEEP) MODEL (SA 1.1), WITH REFINED GEOMETRIES IMPLANTED INTRAOPERATIVELY INTO HUMAN CORTEX (SA 1.2). SPECIFIC AIM 2: DETERMINE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF IMPLANTED, PASSIVE ARRAYS IN SHEEP. . WE WILL DETERMINE THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF OUR HIGH-DENSITY ARRAY BY CHRONICALLY IMPLANTING THE PASSIVE ARRAYS IN SHEEP. ANIMALS WILL BE IMPLANTED OVER 4, 8, 12, AND 24 WEEKS.

OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A NEARLY-AUTOMATED PROCESS FOR THE SUBMISSION OF ALCOHOL RESEARCH DATA INTO THE NIAAADA SO THAT THE DATA SUBMISSION CAN BE PERFORMED ACCURATELY AND EFFICIENTLY BY ALCOHOL RESEARCHERS WITH MINIMUM IT KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCES. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE SHARE HUMAN RESEARCH (SHARE) PLATFORM TO ADDRESS THE UNMET NEED FOR ASSISTING ALCOHOL RESEARCHERS WITH THE SUBMISSION OF STUDY DATA TO NIAAADA. SHARE DOES SO BY OFFERING THE SHARE MEASURE LIBRARY OF PRE-DEFINED STANDARD MEASURES THAT ARE ALREADY MAPPED TO NDA DATA DICTIONARIES. ALCOHOL RESEARCHERS NEED TO ONLY SELECT THE MEASURES THAT THEY WANT TO USE FOR THEIR STUDIES AND LET SHARE DO THE REST FOR DATA SUBMISSION TO NIAAADA. PHASE II AIMS INCLUDE: 1) PLATFORM AND MEASURE DEVELOPMENT. IN PHASE II WE WILL CONTINUE USING A USER-CENTRIC DESIGN PROCESS AND THE LATEST E-TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP SHARE, AND WE WILL EXTEND TO 200 MEASURES IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH (WHEN AVAILABLE). 2) PILOT EVALUATION. THERE WILL BE 4 NIAAADA SUBMISSION WAVES DURING THE TWO-YEAR PHASE II PERIOD. WE PLAN TO ALIGN BOTH AIM 1 AND AIM 2 ACTIVITIES TO THESE 4 SUBMISSION WAVES AND RECRUIT FIVE PROJECTS IN EACH WAVE TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF SHARE VS. NDA. A TOTAL OF 20 PILOT PROJECTS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO USE EITHER SHARE OR NDA FOR NIAAADA SUBMISSION. THE TIME AND COST FOR DATA PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION WILL BE TRACKED, AND THE ACCURACY OF SUBMITTED DATA ASSESSED. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT COMPARED TO NDA, SHARE WILL PERFORM SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN TERMS OF REDUCED TIME AND COST IMPROVED DATA ACCURACY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "72f5ace5-1fee-f3ac-95ce-e47fe1f8280c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44AA027981_7529"}, {"internal_id": 158774847, "Award ID": "R44AA027971", "Award Amount": 605405.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-04-28", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "NOVEL THERAPEUTIC FOR HPA HYPERACTIVITY - SUMMARY.  THE HYPOTHALAMIC PITUITARY ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS IS THE KEY NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM THAT CONTROLS PERIPHERAL RESPONSES TO STRESS. WHILE THE STRESS RESPONSE IS ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL, IT CAN BECOME DYSREGULATED. HYPERACTIVITY OF THE HPA CHARACTERIZES A VARIETY OF ILLNESSES INCLUDING ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD). HPA HYPERACTIVITY IS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER PRODUCTION OF CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING FACTOR (CRF) AND GLUCOCORTICOIDS.  THIS PHASE II SBIR AIMS TO DEVELOP A NOVEL BIOLOGIC THERAPEUTIC AIMED AT NORMALIZING PATHOLOGIC HPA HYPERACTIVITY. MEDICATIONS TO MODULATE THE HPA AXIS ARE CURRENTLY SUB-OPTIMAL. THERAPEUTIC ATTEMPTS TO USE GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR (GR) ANTAGONISTS HAVE SHOWN SOME PROMISE IN CONDITIONS LIKE AUD AND DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, CHRONICALLY BLOCKING GR-MEDIATED EFFECTS CAN BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AS, FOR INSTANCE, IT INTERFERES WITH GLUCOCORTICOID NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, LEADING TO INCREASED CORTISOL LEVELS AND MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR ACTIVATION. CRF RECEPTOR TYPE 1 (CRF1) ANTAGONISTS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY EXPLORED, BUT THUS FAR HAVE PROVEN DISAPPOINTING, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THE PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS PROPERTIES OF THE EXISTING DRUGS.

AUD ALSO ECONOMICALLY EXPENSIVE, WITH $249 BILLION SPENT ANNUALLY FOR COSTS RELATED TO HEALTHCARE, LOST WORK PRODUCTIVITY, AND CRIME. DESPITE THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF AUD AND ITS SEVERE CONSEQUENCES, LESS THAN 20% OF THOSE WITH AUD RECEIVE ANY TREATMENT, MAINLY DUE TO KEY DRAWBACKS OF CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS. GUIDELINES FOR AUD TREATMENT INCLUDE PHARMACOTHERAPY, BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION, OR BOTH. META-ANALYSES CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATE THAT FIRST-LINE AUD MEDICATIONS (NALTREXONE AND ACAMPROSATE) ARE ONLY MODERATELY EFFECTIVE, AT BEST. AUD PHARMACOTHERAPIES ALSO HAVE COMMON SIDE EFFECTS THAT LIMIT ACCEPTABILITY TO PATIENTS. SIMILAR TO MEDICATIONS, BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT), PROVIDE ONLY SMALL/MODERATE TREATMENT BENEFITS. IN ADDITION, PROGRAMS OFTEN REQUIRE ABSTINENCE, WHICH CAN BE A BARRIER AS MANY AUD PATIENTS PREFER NON-ABSTINENT GOALS. RECENT PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ACUPUNCTURE OF A PERIPHERAL NERVE PATHWAY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY MODULATE CRAVING-, REWARD-, AND WITHDRAWAL-RELATED RESPONSES FOR DRUGS OF ABUSE. WE, THUS, HYPOTHESIZE THAT PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATION CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR AUD THROUGH ITS DIRECT EFFECTS ON CRAVING, REWARD, AND WITHDRAWAL. THUS, THERANOVA HAS DEVELOPED THE EMPOWER NEUROMODULATION SYSTEM, A PORTABLE, EASY-TO-USE TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION (TENS) DEVICE FOR NON-INVASIVE NERVE STIMULATION AS A TREATMENT FOR AUD. THE EMPOWER NEUROMODULATION SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A SMALL, WEARABLE CONTROLLER AND GEL ELECTRODES THAT ARE TEMPORARILY ADHERED TO THE SKIN TO STIMULATE THE UNDERLYING NERVE. OUR PHASE I CLINICAL STUDY WITH AUD PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE EMPOWER TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (MEAN REDUCTION = 29%, P=0.026), ALCOHOL CRAVING INTENSITY (MEAN REDUCTION 21%, P=0.001), AND ANXIETY (MEAN REDUCTION = 31%, P<0.001) (VS.

DRUG USE AND HEALTH, 14.1 MILLION ADULTS AGES 18 AND OLDER HAD ALCOHOL USE DISORDER, AND APPROXIMATELY 825,000 PEOPLE INDICATED HEAVY ALCOHOL USE. HOWEVER, ONLY ABOUT 8% OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD AUD IN 2018 RECEIVED TREATMENT. IN PART, THE LACK OF TREATMENT RESULTS FROM THE PAUCITY OF EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTICS AVAILABLE TO TREAT AUD, AND RESEARCH IS ONGOING TO DEVELOP NEW THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES. LOHOCLA RESEARCH CORPORATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPING SUCH A THERAPEUTIC, CALLED NEZAVIST, WHICH WAS SHOWN IN NONCLINICAL MODELS TO REDUCE ALCOHOL RELAPSE IN DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS. THE GOAL OF LOHOCLA IS TO PRODUCE A TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH AUD, WHO WISH TO REDUCE THEIR ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. NEZAVIST ACTS AS A POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR OF GABA-A RECEPTORS, ACTING AT A NOVEL SITE ON THE RECEPTOR DISTINCT FROM OTHER MODULATORS SUCH AS BENZODIAZEPINES. THE OTHER NOVEL CHARACTERISTIC OF NEZAVIST IS ITS SITE OF ACTION WITHIN THE INTESTINE, WHERE NEZAVIST MODULATES THE ACTIVITY OF THE ENTERIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND PRODUCES ITS EFFECT ON ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION THROUGH A GUT-BRAIN COMMUNICATION PATHWAY. BY THIS MEANS, NEZAVIST CAN INFLUENCE BRAIN ACTIVITY WITHOUT ITSELF ENTERING THE BRAIN. THIS APPLICATION IS FOR A PHASE IIB RENEWAL OF SBIR U44AA024905, WHICH WILL SUPPORT THE COMPLETION AND SUBMISSION OF AN IND APPLICATION TO THE FDA AND THE PERFORMANCE OF PHASE1 SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY CLINICAL TRIALS OF NEZAVIST. DURING THE COURSE OF THE CURRENT SBIR GRANT, LOHOCLA DEVELOPED A METHOD TO SCALE UP THE SYNTHESIS OF NEZAVIST, USING FLOW CHEMISTRY TO CIRCUMVENT HAZARDOUS STEPS, AND OBTAINED KILOGRAM QUANTITIES OF CGMP NEZAVIST. A SPRAY-DRIED DISPERSION FORMULATION HAS BEEN PRODUCED THAT ENHANCES BIOAVAILABILITY. IN VITRO ADME STUDIES WERE PERFORMED, INCLUDING DETERMINING PATHWAYS OF METABOLISM, AND INVESTIGATING METABOLIC PROCESSES IN TISSUES FROM SEVERAL SPECIES, WHICH ASSISTED IN THE CHOICE OF SPECIES FOR IN VIVO TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOKINETICS. IN VITRO INTERACTIONS WITH TRANSPORTERS AND CYP450 ENZYMES WERE ALSO COMPLETED. THE SPRAY-DRIED DISPERSION FORMULATION WAS USED TO ASSESS PHARMACOKINETICS AND TOXICOLOGY IN SEVERAL SPECIES, AND THE RESULTS OF THE TOXICOLOGY STUDIES PROVIDE THE DATA NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE DOSING LEVELS FOR THE FIRST-IN-HUMAN STUDIES. A PRE-IND MEETING WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH A FAVORABLE OUTCOME. OVERALL, LOHOCLA HAS COMPLETED MOST OF THE IND-ENABLING STUDIES NEEDED TO PROGRESS TO CLINICAL TRIALS, INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS FOR ADMINISTERING THE DRUG TO HUMANS. THE PROPOSED PHASE IIB RENEWAL INCLUDES COMPLETION OF THE MASS BALANCE STUDY RECOMMENDED BY THE FDA TO BE INCLUDED IN THE IND APPLICATION, AND SYNTHESIS OF CGMP FORMULATION THAT CAN BE USED IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS. ONCE THE IND IS APPROVED, PHASE 1A AND PHASE 1B CLINICAL TRIALS ARE PROPOSED. CONCURRENT WITH THE CLINICAL TRIALS, A LONG-TERM NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY STUDY IN RAT WILL BE PERFORMED THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE A NOAEL IN ORDER TO PROCEED TO HUMAN LABORATORY STUDIES AND PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIALS. A COMMERCIALIZATION PLAN PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE MARKET POTENTIAL FOR NEZAVIST. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PHASE IIB WORK WILL PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR EFFICACY STUDIES OF A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACH TO REDUCE EXCESSIVE AND HARMFUL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION.", "Place of Performance

HOWEVER, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO DMP EXISTS THAT CAN BE USED TO HELP IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WITH AUD TO INCREASE THEIR ENROLLMENT IN RESEARCH. THIS MEANS THAT HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND RESEARCHERS ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY AND ENROLL YOUNG ADULTS WITH AUD NEED TO EITHER RECRUIT IN PERSON (WHICH IS TIME-CONSUMING AND LACKS SCALABILITY) OR THROUGH THE USE OF FACEBOOK AND OTHER BROAD TRADITIONAL DMPS, WHICH IS INEFFICIENT AND NOT TAILORED (I.E., IT WASTES TIME AND MONEY PAYING FOR ADS THAT WILL BE SHOWN TO MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT OUD).

CRF RECEPTOR TYPE 1 (CRF1) ANTAGONISTS HAVE ALSO BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY BUT HAVE GENERALLY BEEN UNSATISFACTORY DUE TO SIDE EFFECTS AND LIMITED EFFICACY ON THE HPA. THUS, THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE UNMET MEDICAL NEED FOR IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL THERAPEUTICS TO NORMALIZE HPA HYPERACTIVITY THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND TOLERABLE FOR LONG-TERM USE.  HPA HYPERACTIVITY IS A KEY PATHOGENIC DRIVER OF AUD AND A VALIDATED THERAPEUTIC TARGET. EXCESSIVE ACTIVATION OF THE HPA AXIS RESULTS IN INCREASED GLUCOCORTICOIDS RELEASE, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND PERIPHERAL ORGANS. PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO ELEVATED GLUCOCORTICOIDS HAS DETRIMENTAL ACTIONS ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, CAUSING HIPPOCAMPAL AND PREFRONTAL CORTEX FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS, HYPER-REACTIVITY OF NEURAL AND NEUROENDOCRINE RESPONSES TO STRESS. HPA FEEDBACK IS DISRUPTED IN AUD DUE TO OVERACTIVITY. EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT PREVENTING EXCESSIVE HPA ACTIVATION WILL RESTORE HPA NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND RESET THE SYSTEM AT MORE PHYSIOLOGICAL LEVELS, REDUCING MOTIVATION FOR DRINKING AND RELAPSE.

THE TOTAL ECONOMIC COST OF AUD TO SOCIETY IS A STAGGERING $224 BILLION EACH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES (2). A TOTAL OF $33 BILLION IS SPENT EACH YEAR TO TREAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD), WITH LESS THAN 4% OF TREATMENT SPENDING FOR PHARMACOTHERAPY (3). DISULFIRAM, A NONCOMPETITIVE, IRREVERSIBLE (SUICIDE) INHIBITOR OF ALDH2 AND ALDH1 (4) (5) HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT AUD FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS (6). UNFORTUNATELY, DISULFIRAM IS A MORE POTENT INHIBITOR OF ALDH1, ALSO INHIBITS ALDH5, AND APPEARS TO BIND NON-SELECTIVELY TO MANY OTHER ENZYMES AND PROTEINS, LEADING TO ADVERSE OFF-TARGET EFFECTS (7). THERE IS A CLEAR UNMET NEED FOR BETTER TREATMENTS AND GREATER UTILIZATION, WITH A LARGE OPPORTUNITY FOR SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PHARMACOTHERAPIES TO TREAT AUD. AUD IS A COMPLEX DISORDER. VOLKOW AND KOOB (8) POSTULATE THAT A SURGE OF DOPAMINE (DA) DRIVES CRAVING AND ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR THROUGH REWARD CIRCUITS (9).

BILLIONS ARE SPENT ANNUALLY TREATING ALCOHOL POISONING CASES. HOWEVER, NO FDA-APPROVED PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL POISONING EXISTS, NOR ARE ANY MEANS OF BLOCKING ALCOHOL\u2019S EFFECTS KNOWN. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP A PHARMACEUTICAL THAT RAPIDLY CLEARS ETHANOL FROM THE BLOOD AND FUNCTIONS AS A THERAPEUTIC FOR ALCOHOL POISONING AND AS A HARM REDUCTION TOOL FOLLOWING BINGE DRINKING. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO VALIDATE A LEAD PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION COMPRISING THREE ENZYMES ENCAPSULATED IN LIPOSOMES FOR THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY ELIMINATE ETHANOL IN VIVO. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT A HIGH RATE OF ETHANOL DEGRADATION CAN BE MAINTAINED IN VIVO BY INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF THIS FORMULATION, THEREBY AMELIORATING ALCOHOL POISONING. THE RATIONALE UNDERLYING THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT ENCAPSULATED ENZYME SYSTEMS ARE MORE ACTIVE THAN FREE ENZYMES IN BLOOD SERUM. ENCAPSULATION OF THE ENZYMES IN LIPOSOMES PHYSICALLY SEPARATES THEM FROM SERUM PROTEASES, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, AND OFF-TARGET LIGANDS. IT ALSO CO-LOCALIZES THE ENZYMES WITHIN THE LIPOSOME, GREATLY IMPROVING ENZYME PATHWAY KINETICS. THE INNOVATIONS THAT WILL ENABLE THIS WORK ARE RECENTLY GAINED INSIGHTS INTO ENZYME BIOCHEMISTRY AND CO-LOCALIZATION AS WELL AS METHODOLOGIES THAT GENTLY ENCAPSULATE PROTEIN AT HIGH YIELDS. SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE: AIM 1: DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ENCAPSULATED ENZYME SYSTEM ELIMINATES ETHANOL IN VIVO. AIM 2: USE SCREENING AND DIRECTED EVOLUTION TECHNIQUES TO DISCOVER IMPROVED ENZYMES. AIM 3: PROTOTYPE A MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM FOR HIGH-EFFICIENCY PROTEIN ENCAPSULATION. THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT IS A SCALABLE LIPOSOMAL FORMULATION THAT CAN RAPIDLY ELIMINATE ALCOHOL FROM THE BLOOD. THE DATA FROM THIS WORK WILL ALSO SUPPORT RAISING OF PRIVATE CAPITAL FOR IND-ENABLING PRECLINICAL STUDIES.

NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR ALD CURRENTLY EXIST BUT FOR REDUCING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION OR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION. THE CURRENT PAUCITY OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT EXPERIMENTAL MODELS IMPEDES ANY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY ALD PROGNOSTIC INDICATORS AND POTENTIAL EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING TO DEVELOP AN ANIMAL MODEL THAT EXHIBITS SEVERE ALCOHOL- INDUCED INJURY SUCH AS FIBROSIS OR CIRRHOSIS. BIOMIMETIC IN VITRO MODELS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO ALLOW BOTH INVESTIGATION OF THE MECHANISMS OF LIVER FIBROSIS AND HIGHER-THROUGHPUT SCREENING OF DRUGS AND DRUG COMBINATIONS THAT DECREASE LIVER FAT ACCUMULATION AND/OR PREVENT THE GENERATION OF A FIBROTIC REACTION TO STEATOSIS. WHILE SOME IN VITRO PLATFORMS HAVE RECENTLY REPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE PATHOLOGICALLY RELEVANT LIVER MODELS, THEIR METHODOLOGY LACKS BOTH DYNAMIC (MECHANICAL) CUES THAT MIGHT IMPROVE THE MODEL RELEVANCE AND IN SITU BIOANALYSIS CAPACITY, LIMITING THEIR POSSIBLE INTEGRATION WITH PERSONALIZED DRUG SCREENING. ALSO, THOUGH SOME OF THESE PLATFORMS SHOWN MAINTENANCE OF SEVERAL KEY HEPATOCYTE DIFFERENTIATED FUNCTION IN VITRO, NONE OF THESE PLATFORMS HAVE DEMONSTRATED ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE (ADH) AND CYP2E1 EXPRESSION/ACTIVITY FOR SUSTAINED PERIODS WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR ALCOHOL METABOLISM AND FOR STUDYING ALD.

REAL-TIME, ACCURATE AND DISCREET DEVICES FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF BLOOD ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION (BAC) ARE ESSENTIAL TO EMPOWER MEDICAL RESEARCH WITH RELIABLE RELIABLE MEANS TO MONITOR ALCOHOL BEHAVIOR, AS WELL AS FOR EFFECTIVE PERSONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT. MEASUREMENT OF ETHANOL PERSPIRED THROUGH THE SKIN BY MEANS OF WEARABLE DEVICES IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST FOR THE POSSIBILITY TO PERFORM DISCREET AND UNOBTRUSIVE MONITORING OF BAC, BUT AVAILABLE DEVICES ARE STILL LACKING RELIABILITY, ACCURACY AND SENSITIVITY. IN THIS CONTEXT, BIOINSPIRA, INC. HAS DEVELOPED A VERSATILE BACTERIOPHAGE-BASED, COLORIMETRIC SENSOR PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY FOR GAS SENSING. THE NOVEL, IN-HOUSE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY USES A SELF-ASSEMBLING BACTERIOPHAGE SENSOR ARRAY (M13 BACTERIOPHAGE) THAT CAN BE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TO BIND TO SPECIFIC GAS MOLECULES AND CHANGE ITS COLOR PATTERN BASED ON TYPE OF GAS AND CONCENTRATION.

PARTNERSHIP WITH MAYO CLINIC, PROPOSES TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE A HIGHLY INNOVATIVE NEXT-GENERATION CLINICAL INSTRUMENT TOGETHER WITH CUSTOM USER-FRIENDLY DISPLAY AND ANALYSIS SOFTWARE. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL APPARATUS FOR VOLTAMMETRY, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, AND NEUROMODULATION (MAVEN) WILL OFFER WIRELESS VOLTAMMETRIC SENSING OF MULTIPLE NEUROTRANSMITTERS (E.G., DOPAMINE, SEROTONIN, AND ADENOSINE) AT CARBON-FIBER MICROELECTRODES. MAVEN CAN BE APPLIED TO A BROAD RANGE OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH SUBJECTS INVOLVING BRAIN NEUROSURGERIES. ALONGSIDE THESE MULTIPLE NEUROCHEMICAL SENSING CAPABILITIES, THE DEVICE WILL BE CAPABLE OF NEAR-SIMULTANEOUS ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL (E.G., ACTION AND LOCAL FIELD POTENTIALS) RECORDINGS. THE MAIN INNOVATION OF THE MAVEN SYSTEM IS TO INCLUDE STATE-OF-THE-ART VOLTAMMETRIC TECHNIQUES TO QUANTITATIVELY MEASURE BOTH PHASIC (STIMULATION-INDUCED) AND TONIC (RESTING) CONCENTRATION LEVELS OF NEUROCHEMICALS IN REAL-TIME AND NEAR-SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH OTHER RECORDING MODALITIES. THIS CAPABILITY IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, MULTIPLE CYCLIC SQUARE WAVE VOLTAMMETRY (MCSWV) WILL ENABLE SECOND-TO-SECOND QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF TONIC EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND SEROTONIN WITH EXCEPTIONAL SPATIAL RESOLUTION, SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, AND MINIMAL TISSUE DISTURBANCE. THIS PROPOSAL EMPLOYS OUR UNIQUE COMBINED EXPERTISE IN NEUROSCIENCE, ELECTROCHEMISTRY, ENGINEERING, AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO VALIDATE THIS NOVEL CLINICAL RESEARCH INSTRUMENT IN PREPARATION FOR ITS USE DURING INTRAOPERATIVE CLINICAL NEUROSURGERIES. ALSO, COMBINING ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY AND ELECTROCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGIES WOULD ENABLE INVESTIGATORS TO PROBE UNEXPLORED LINKS BETWEEN THE ABNORMAL ACTIVITY OF NEURAL ELEMENTS AND THE DOPAMINERGIC, SEROTONERGIC, PURINERGIC (ADENOSINE) DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROPSYCHOPATHOLOGIES, SUCH AS PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE, ESSENTIAL TREMOR, OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER, DEPRESSION, AND EPILEPSY. OUR LARGE ANIMAL MODEL (SWINE) STUDIES EMULATING EXISTING HUMAN INTRAOPERATIVE NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION TO GUIDE AND INFORM THE FINALIZATION OF THE MAVEN DESIGN FOR USE BY THE CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE COMMUNITY IN FUTURE IDE-ENABLED MECHANISTIC CLINICAL STUDIES. OUR PROPOSAL SEEKS TO (1) FINALIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAVEN, TOGETHER WITH A SOPHISTICATED USER-FRIENDLY SOFTWARE INTERFACE THAT (2) MEETS DEVICE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, REGULATORY DESIGN CONTROL, AND MEDICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN AN FDA-APPROVED INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE), AND (3) USE A SWINE MODEL TO DEVELOP MAVEN STIMULATION AND RECORDING PROTOCOLS FOR USE IN EXISTING INTRAOPERATIVE NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES (E.G., DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION NEUROSURGERIES AND CORTICAL LOBECTOMIES).

AS ONE OF THE NATION\u2019S LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH, PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES RECOMMEND CONSISTENT STANDARDIZED ALCOHOL SCREENING. HOWEVER, SCREENING FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE IS UNDERPERFORMED, LABORIOUS, AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS AND CONCERNS ABOUT STIGMATIZING THE PATIENT. TO COMBAT THESE ISSUES, BEAM DIAGNOSTICS, INC. DEVELOPED BEACON, A COMMERCIALIZABLE ALCOHOL MISUSE DIGITAL SCREENING TOOL BASED ON THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF REINFORCER PATHOLOGY DEDICATED TO INCREASING STANDARDIZED SCREENING WITHOUT STIGMATIZING THE PATIENT. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT, WE CONDUCTED A CLINICAL STUDY AT A LARGE MULTI-SITE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SERVING APPROXIMATELY 1M PATIENTS PER YEAR AND VALIDATED BEACON AS DEMONSTRATING ROBUST PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF ALCOHOL MISUSE AND POSITIVE REPORTS OF FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY FROM PROVIDERS. THE GOAL OF THIS PHASE II SBIR IS TO FINALIZE BEACON\u2019S DEVELOPMENT INTO A FULLY REALIZED COMMERCIAL PRODUCT, BOTH AS A STAND-ALONE TOOL AND AS AN INTEGRATED TOOL WITHIN AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR) SYSTEM. AIM 1 WILL ITERATE AND OPTIMIZE THE USER-EXPERIENCE AND ACCESSIBILITY OF BEACON AS A PRODUCT, DEVELOP NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE NORMING, PRODUCE COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL REFERENCE MATERIALS, ENSURE OFFLINE CAPABILITY, AND SPANISH-LANGUAGE TRANSLATION. AIM 2 WILL BE DEDICATED TO INTEGRATING BEACON INTO EPIC, A WIDELY USED ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM WITHIN A HEALTHSYSTEM PARTNER, TO IMPROVE USABILITY, WORKFLOW CAPABILITIES, AND RECORD-KEEPING OF ALCOHOL MISUSE DIRECTLY INTO A PATIENT\u2019S MEDICAL CHART. IN ADDITION, AIM 2 WILL LAUNCH A WAVE-STYLE EDUCATION AND IMPLEMENTATION INITIATIVE TO PROMOTE BEACON\u2019S USE IN THREE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENTS. FINALLY, BEAM WILL COMPLETE AN EXPLORATORY AIM SEEKING TO VALIDATE BEACON AS A MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE TOOL.

SIRNA DRUG TO AMELIORATE THE PATHOLOGY AND PROGRESSION OF ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED LIVER DISEASE (ALD). ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION REMAINS A LEADING CAUSE OF HEPATIC PATHOLOGY WORLDWIDE AND IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOURCES OF PREVENTABLE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. IN THE U.S., ALCOHOL ABUSE IMPACTS OVER 10 MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND IS A MAJOR HEALTHCARE BURDEN. THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ALD IS MULTI-FACTORIAL, INCLUDING OBESITY, OXIDATIVE STRESS, AND INFLAMMATION, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE THE PATHOLOGICAL PROGRESSION FROM STEATOSIS TO STEATOHEPATITIS, CIRRHOSIS, AND FIBROSIS. EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES TARGETING ALD REMAIN CRITICALLY ABSENT. TARGETING THE UNDERLYING PATHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS LEADING TO ALCOHOL-INDUCED HEPATIC STEATOSIS MAY PREVENT THE CASCADE OF EVENTS INDUCING INFLAMMATION AND IRREVERSIBLE LIVER DAMAGE. ALCOHOL-INDUCED MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION IS A KEY DRIVER OF STEATOSIS AND RELATED METABOLIC DEFECTS LEADING TO SEVERE ALD. WE PROPOSE THE NOVEL APPROACH OF TREATING ALD BY SAFELY INCREASING MITOCHONDRIAL METABOLISM IN THE LIVER AND WILL TEST THIS IN ACUTE AND CHRONIC MODELS OF ALD. LIPIDS ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE LIVER WHERE THEY ARE METABOLIZED IN MITOCHONDRIA THROUGH CYTOSOLIC BETA-OXIDATION, WHICH IS COUPLED THROUGH THE CITRIC ACID CYCLE TO THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN (ETC) AND MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATION. NADH AND FADH2, ARE THE TWO MAIN PRODUCTS FROM BETA-OXIDATION THAT FEED INTO THE ETC (NADH IS SUBSTRATE FOR COMPLEX I AND FADH2 FOR COMPLEX II), THEREFORE INCREASING ETC ACTIVITY WILL INCREASE BETA- OXIDATION. ENHANCING HEPATIC ETC ACTIVITY COULD THEREFORE SPEED UP THE DEGRADATION OF FATTY ACIDS, PREVENTING STEATOSIS. A KEY ENDOGENOUS NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF THE ETC IS THE MCJ PROTEIN (MCJ/DNAJC15 OR METHYLATION- CONTROLLED J PROTEIN). MCJ IS A MITOCHONDRIAL PROTEIN THAT NEGATIVELY REGULATES ETC METABOLISM BY BINDING TO COMPLEX I. OUR WORK DEMONSTRATES THAT REMOVAL OF MCJ APPEARS TO BE SAFE AND INCREASES MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATION WITHOUT INDUCING OXIDATIVE STRESS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A GALNAC (N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINE) LINKED SIRNA DRUG THAT IS SPECIFIC TO MCJ. CONJUGATION TO GALNAC DIRECTS THE SIRNA TO LIVER HEPATOCYTES AND PROVIDES A DIRECT ROUTE TARGETING ALD. VALIDATING AN SIRNA APPROACH TO TREATING LIVER DISEASE, TWO GALNAC LINKED SIRNA DRUGS ARE APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR TREATMENT OF LIVER DISEASES (PATISIRAN, LIPID-NANOPARTICLE FORMULATED SIRNA AND GIVOSIRAN, GALNAC-CONJUGATED SIRNA). WE HAVE DEVELOPED A LEAD THERAPEUTIC, GALNAC LINKED SIRNA SPECIFIC TO MCJ (MITO-1041) AND VALIDATED OUR SIRNA APPROACH TO REDUCING STEATOSIS AND FIBROSIS IN LIVER USING MANY MOUSE MODELS OF FATTY LIVER DISEASE. MITO-1041 IS PROPRIETARY AND SPECIFIC FOR HUMAN, PRIMATE, AND MOUSE MCJ, ALLOWING FOR RAPID IND ENABLING STUDIES WHEN THE TIME COMES. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NOT YET TESTED MITO-1041 IN MOUSE MODELS OF ALD. THEREFORE, OUR SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A HEPATIC MCJ TARGETED SIRNA (MITO-1041) TO AMELIORATE ALCOHOL-INDUCED STEATOSIS AND ASSOCIATED PATHOLOGIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "93221cbf-4723-7282-6b29-0a349628cf2e-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R41AA030517_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151590325, "Award ID": "R41AA030516", "Award Amount": 259971.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-23", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "ACSS2 INHIBITION IN TREATING ALCOHOL ABUSE - ALCOHOL USE DISORDER REPRESENTS A TREMENDOUS BURDEN ON SOCIETY.

LIVER DISEASE - PROJECT SUMMARY ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOL-RELATED DISEASES ARE A MAJOR MEDICAL BURDEN IN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES. CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM IS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA, INCREASES IN INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY, AND ELEVATED SYSTEMIC LEVELS OF BACTERIAL PRODUCTS. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS (E. FAECALIS) IS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE MILD STEATOTIC LIVER DISEASE AND TO EXACERBATE ETHANOL-INDUCED LIVER DISEASE IN MICE. WE IDENTIFIED CYTOLYSIN, A TWO-SUBUNIT EXOTOXIN SECRETED BY E. FAECALIS, TO CAUSE HEPATOCYTE DEATH AND LIVER INJURY. COMPARED WITH CONTROLS, PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOL USE DISORDER OR ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS HAVE INCREASED FECAL NUMBERS OF E. FAECALIS. THE PRESENCE OF CYTOLYSIN-POSITIVE (CYTOLYTIC) E. FAECALIS CORRELATED WITH LIVER DISEASE SEVERITY AND MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS. HOW CHRONIC ALCOHOL USE RESULTS IN INCREASED INTESTINAL AND HEPATIC NUMBERS OF CYTOLYSIN-POSITIVE E. FAECALIS IS NOT KNOWN. RESULTS FROM OUR LABORATORY SUGGEST THAT INCREASED INTESTINAL NUMBERS OF E. FAECALIS ARE FACILITATED BY CHANGES IN THE INTESTINAL GLYCOCALYX AND IN PARTICULAR BY REDUCED (1,2)-FUCOSYLATION OF GLYCOPROTEINS ON THE APICAL MEMBRANE OF INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELLS. ALCOHOL- MEDIATED SUPPRESSION OF FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 2 (FUT2) ALLOWS INTESTINAL COLONIZATION AND BACTERIAL TRANSLOCATION OF E. FAECALIS. FURTHERMORE, TRANSLOCATED E. FAECALIS IS PHAGOCYTOSED AND ELIMINATED BY THE COMPLEMENT RECEPTOR OF THE IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY (CRIG) ON KUPFFER CELLS. PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS HAVE LOWER HEPATIC CRIG EXPRESSION, WHICH REDUCES E. FAECALIS ELIMINATION, PROLONGS EXPOSURE TO E. FAECALIS AND INCREASES LIVER DAMAGE. THUS, ETHANOL ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN INTESTINAL COLONIZATION AND HEPATIC ELIMINATION OF E. FAECALIS PROMOTES ALCOHOL-RELATED LIVER DISEASE. OUR EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH IS TO USE MOUSE MODELS OF ETHANOL FEEDING TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF FUT2 IN LIMITING INTESTINAL COLONIZATION OF E. FAECALIS AND REDUCING LIVER DISEASE (AIM 1). WE WILL ALSO ASSESS THE FUNCTIONAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE PHAGOCYTIC PROTEIN CRIG TO E. FAECALIS ELIMINATION AND TO LIVER DISEASE (AIM 2). NEW STRATEGIES WILL BE TESTED TO PREVENT AND AMELIORATE ETHANOL-INDUCED LIVER DISEASE IN PRECLINICAL MODELS. WE BELIEVE THESE STUDIES WILL PROVIDE NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE MICROBIOTA TO ALCOHOL-RELATED LIVER DISEASE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State

THIS INNOVATIVE USE OF SM POSTS TO DELIVER A SNMC GAME HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF MEETING STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE (ON INSTAGRAM AND SNAPCHAT) AND IS LESS RESOURCE-INTENSIVE THAN IN-PERSON, ONLINE, AND APP-BASED NORMS INTERVENTION STRATEGIES. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL UTILIZE TARGETED ADS, WHICH ARE PAID VERSIONS OF POSTS, TO INNOVATIVELY ADDRESSES SEVERAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL SNMCS, SUCH AS AN INABILITY TO CONDUCT RCTS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE CAMPAIGNS WITHIN A CAMPUS AND A RELIANCE ON SELF-REPORT TO ASSESS EXPOSURE TO THE CAMPAIGN. THE PROPOSED PROJECT HAS TWO PHASES: (1) DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAMIFIED SNMC, 2 COLLEGE TRUTHS & 1 LIE (2T1L) (PHASE 1), AND (2) A HYBRID FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY PILOT RCT (PHASE 2). 2T1L INVOLVES PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFYING AN INCORRECT NORM FROM A LIST OF THREE \u201cFACTS\u201d ABOUT FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS; THE GAME THEN CORRECTS THE MISPERCEIVED NORM AND REINFORCES THE CORRECTION WITH GRAPHICS. EACH ROUND WILL INCLUDE RISK-REDUCING ALCOHOL NORMS, EITHER AS TRUTHS OR LIES. 2T1L ALSO INCLUDED FEATURES LIKE POINTS AND LEADERBOARDS THAT INCREASE INTEREST, ENGAGEMENT, AND BELIEVABILITY, ESPECIALLY AMONG HEAVY DRINKERS WHO TEND TO BE REACTIVE TO NORMS RE-EDUCATION. PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH METHODS WILL ALSO BE EMPLOYED TO PRODUCE 2T1L TO MAXIMIZE APPEAL AND RELEVANCE TO FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS. IN YEAR 1, WE WILL CONDUCT A NORMS DOCUMENTATION SURVEY (N=400) TO DETERMINE GAME NORMS (AIM 1A), AND FOCUS GROUPS (N=50) TO IDENTIFY GAME AESTHETICS PREFERRED BY FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS (AIM 1B). IN THE BEGINNING OF YEAR 2, WE WILL CONDUCT A SECOND SET OF FOCUS GROUPS (N=50) TO TEST THE 2T1L GAME AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE USER EXPERIENCE OF 2T1L PRIOR TO LAUNCH (AIM 1C). PHASE 1 WILL CULMINATE IN A FINALIZED VERSION OF THE 2T1L SNMC TO BE EVALUATED BY A HYBRID FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY PILOT RCT (N=414) IN PHASE 2.

BISEXUAL WOMEN REPORT HIGHER RATES OF HEAVY EPISODIC DRINKING COMPARED TO HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN, AS WELL AS HIGHER RATES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT COMPARED TO HETEROSEXUAL OR LESBIAN WOMEN. BISEXUAL WOMEN ALSO REPORT HIGHER LEVELS OF MINORITY STRESS, LOWER LEVELS OF CONNECTION TO THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY, AND GREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (ANXIETY, DEPRESSION) COMPARED TO LESBIAN WOMEN. TAKEN TOGETHER, THERE IS A STRONG NEED TO TARGET ALCOHOL USE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AMONG BISEXUAL WOMEN. PROBLEMATICALLY, EXISTING INTEGRATED ALCOHOL AND SEXUAL ASSAULT INTERVENTIONS DO NOT CONSIDER THE UNIQUE STRESSORS (MINORITY STRESS, DISCONNECTION FROM THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY) FACED BY BISEXUAL WOMEN. BISEXUAL WOMEN ALSO REPORT LESS BENEFIT FROM EXISTING PREVENTION APPROACHES INTERVENTIONS.

FAMILY-ORIENTED PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS ARE GENERALLY MOST EFFECTIVE, BUT MOST INTERVENTIONS ARE DELIVERED IN SCHOOLS. HOME-BASED FAMILY INTERVENTIONS ARE RESOURCE INTENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT ON A WIDE SCALE; THUS, THEIR REACH AND SUSTAINABILITY ARE LIMITED. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS R34 PLANNING GRANT IS TO DEVELOP AND ASSESS FEASIBILITY OF AN INITIAL VERSION OF THE BRIEF INTERVENTION TO PREVENT ALCOHOL SOCIALIZATION (BI-PAS), WHICH WILL BE DELIVERED TO PARENTS OF RISING 6TH GRADERS BY PEDIATRIC HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS DURING THE ANNUAL WELL-CHILD VISIT.

AS A PRIMARY CARE-BASED INTERVENTION, BI-PAS WILL HAVE A WIDE REACH BECAUSE OF THE NON-STIGMATIZING INTERVENTION CONTEXT.

FURTHERMORE, THIS INTERVENTION MAY PROVIDE A WAY TO MEET AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS STANDARDS REGARDING ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE FOR PARENTS ABOUT ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL USE. WE HAVE TWO SPECIFIC AIMS. FIRST, WE WILL DEVELOP AND OPTIMIZE THE BI-PAS INTERVENTION MESSAGE CONTENT AND DELIVERY THROUGH SEMI- STRUCTURED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH PARENTS AND PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS. OUR SECOND AIM IS TO CONDUCT A PILOT STUDY TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY, IMPLEMENTATION, AND PARENTAL ENGAGEMENT OVER TIME.

ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA USE PLACE INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH RISK FOR ACUTE AND LONG- TERM NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES (VOLKOW ET AL., 2014; WHITE & HINGSON, 2014). SAM USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK FOR CONSEQUENCES, COMPARED TO MARIJUANA USE ALONE OR CAM USE (LIPPERMAN-KREDA ET AL., 2017).

DESPITE THE RELATIVELY LARGE CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL LITERATURE ON PROTECTIVE BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES (PBS; PEARSON, 2013), LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHY YOUNG ADULTS CHOOSE TO USE PBS ON SPECIFIC OCCASIONS OR WHY YOUNG ADULTS MIGHT USE PBS DIFFERENTLY ACROSS OCCASIONS. MOREOVER, FINDINGS HAVE BEEN MIXED FOR PBS USE AS A MEDIATOR OF INTERVENTION EFFECTS (REID & CAREY, 2015). THUS, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONCEPTUALIZATION, APPLICATION, AND UNDERSTANDING OF ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA PBS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE MOTIVATIONS, OR REASONS, FOR WHEN, WHY, AND HOW YOUNG ADULTS MAY OR MAY NOT USE PBS IN A QUALITY MANNER WHEN USING ALCOHOL AND/OR MARIJUANA.

FURTHER, INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY TO COMPLETE ALCOHOL TREATMENT; THOSE THAT COMPLETE TREATMENT ARE QUICKER TO RELAPSE AND DISPLAY MORE SEVERE PATTERNS OF ALCOHOL USE. THERE IS A PAUCITY OF EMPIRICALLY BASED INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED BY AND FOR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES, WHICH HAS LED COMMUNITIES AND RESEARCH PARTNERS TO RELY ON ADAPTATIONS OF EXISTING EMPIRICALLY BASED INTERVENTIONS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR NON- INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS. INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS HAVE INCREASINGLY ADVOCATED FOR HEALTH INTERVENTIONS TO BE CULTURALLY GROUNDED. A CULTURALLY GROUNDED APPROACH INVOLVES CLOSE COLLABORATION AMONG COMMUNITIES AND RESEARCHERS IN THE DESIGN OF INTERVENTION EFFORTS ROOTED IN INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE, PROTOCOLS, AND PRACTICES.

RESEARCH THAT APPLIES A CULTURALLY GROUNDED FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS HISTORICAL TRAUMA IN ALCOHOL INTERVENTIONS IS A CRITICAL NEXT STEP TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS. INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS HAVE FACED HISTORIES OF GENOCIDE, COLONIZATION, FORCED ASSIMILATION, AND EXCLUSION THAT UNDERMINE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. HISTORICAL TRAUMA RESULTED IN CULTURAL SHIFTS IN ALCOHOL USE. ACTS OF OPPRESSION STEMMING FROM COLONIZATION SUCH AS THE BANNING OF TRADITIONAL WAYS OF HEALING LEFT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WITHOUT MECHANISMS FOR COPING WITH EMOTIONAL DISTRESS. THIS COUPLED WITH THE EMOTIONAL AFTEREFFECTS OF HISTORICAL TRAUMA MADE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE VULNERABLE TO DEVELOPING MALADAPTIVE WAYS OF COPING.

ENGRAMS DESCRIBED FOR ETHANOL IN MAMMALS ARE LIMITED TO SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS, ENCODING FACTORS, AND BEHAVIORAL STATES, AND LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT EFFECTORS IN ETHANOL ENGRAMS. DROSOPHILA OFFER SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THROUGHPUT, FACILITATING WHOLE BRAIN CAPTURE OF ENGRAMS, TESTING OF MULTIPLE TYPES OF POTENTIAL ENGRAMS, AND MOLECULAR DISCOVERY OF THE MECHANISMS OF ENCODING.

FORTUNATELY, SHORT-TERM PRE-OPERATIVE ABSTINENCE FROM ALCOHOL MITIGATES MANY SURGICAL RISKS, AND CAREFULLY TIMED INTERVENTIONS CAN PREVENT COMPLICATIONS AND ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME. HOWEVER, IMPLEMENTATION OF PRE- OPERATIVE ALCOHOL INTERVENTIONS REQUIRES ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH RISKY ALCOHOL USE AT LEAST FOUR WEEKS PRIOR TO SURGERY. PRE-OPERATIVE CLINICS FREQUENTLY FAIL TO SCREEN FOR ALCOHOL USE OR DO SO TOO CLOSE TO THE SURGERY DATE TO ALLOW TIME FOR INTERVENTION. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) OFFER AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF ACCESSIBLE CLINICAL DATA THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO IDENTIFY RISKY ALCOHOL USE EARLY IN THE SURGICAL EPISODE OF CARE. INNOVATIVE METHODS ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY DATA ELEMENTS AND CREATE ALGORITHMS TO CAPTURE RISKY ALCOHOL USE FROM STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED EHR DATA. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND OTHER MACHINE LEARNING (ML)-BASED APPROACHES ARE BEST SUITED TO EXTRACT AND ANALYZE ALCOHOL-RELATED CLINICAL NARRATIVES, AND TO SYNTHESIZE HETEROGENEOUS ALCOHOL-RELATED DATA THROUGH COMPUTER-ASSISTED METHODS. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL LEVERAGE EHR DATA TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE RISKY ALCOHOL USE AMONG SURGICAL PATIENTS TO IDENTIFY COHORTS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM PRE-OPERATIVE ALCOHOL INTERVENTION. THE STUDY AIMS ARE TO: 1) DEVELOP AN ELECTRONIC, AUTOMATED COMPUTABLE PHENOTYPE TO CLASSIFY RISKY ALCOHOL USE PRIOR TO SURGERY USING NLP AND ML; 2) VALIDATE THE ALGORITHM THROUGH PROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION; AND 3) LONGITUDINALLY EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RISKY ALCOHOL USE PHENOTYPES AND ADVERSE SURGICAL OUTCOMES INCLUDING COMPLICATIONS AND HOSPITAL READMISSIONS. INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS OF NLP AND ML WILL SUPPORT EVALUATION OF UNSTRUCTURED EHR DATA (E.G. CLINICAL NOTES) AND WILL ENABLE INTEGRATION OF HETEROGENEOUS ALCOHOL USE DATA TO CREATE THE COMPUTABLE PHENOTYPE. THE AIMS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH COLLABORATION OF EXPERTS IN KEY CLINICAL DOMAINS AND ADVANCED METHODOLOGIES. THIS STUDY WILL CREATE AND VALIDATE THE FIRST ALCOHOL-SPECIFIC PHENOTYPE-BASED ALGORITHM FOR SURGICAL PATIENTS, WHICH WILL SUPPORT FUTURE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND RESEARCH INTO ALCOHOL-RELATED SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES.

WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A KNOCKIN MOUSE EXPRESSING BK CHANNELS THAT ARE INSENSITIVE TO ETHANOL BUT FUNCTION NORMALLY OTHERWISE TO IDENTIFY MOLECULAR ADAPTATIONS TO CHRONIC ETHANOL THAT SELECTIVELY RESULT FROM THE ACTION OF ETHANOL ON BK CHANNELS. MOLECULAR ADAPTATIONS THAT EMERGE IN BRAIN REGIONS RELEVANT TO THE MOTIVATIONAL AND AFFECTIVE EFFECTS OF ETHANOL (VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA, AMYGDALA, PRELIMBIC PREFRONTAL CORTEX, AND HABENULA) WILL BE EXAMINED IN A WELL-VALIDATED MOUSE MODEL OF ETHANOL DEPENDENCE. WE WILL LEVERAGE THE UNPRECEDENTED SENSITIVITY AND ACCURACY OF DATA-INDEPENDENT ACQUISITION MASS SPECTROMETRY TO QUANTIFY CHANGES IN PROTEIN ABUNDANCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE PROTEOME. FURTHERMORE, WE WILL IMPLEMENT WEIGHTED CORRELATION NETWORK ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY PROTEINS THAT ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO DRIVE CONCERTED CHANGES IN ABUNDANCE ACROSS MODULES OF CO-EXPRESSED PROTEINS. NINE OF THESE PROTEINS WILL BE SELECTED AT THE END OF THE R21 PHASE FOR FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS DURING THE R33 PHASE. WE WILL USE VIRALLY MEDIATED RNA INTERFERENCE TO KNOCK DOWN CANDIDATE PROTEINS IN TARGETED BRAIN REGIONS AND EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF THESE PROTEINS ON THE TIME-COURSE, AMPLITUDE AND PERSISTENCE OF DRINKING ESCALATION IN ETHANOL-DEPENDENT MICE. WE PREDICT THAT SOME OF THE PROTEINS CONTROLLING DRINKING ESCALATION WILL ALSO CONTROL ACUTE SENSITIVITY TO ETHANOL, SUCH THAT THEIR UP- OR DOWN-REGULATION IN ETHANOL-DEPENDENT MICE WOULD PROGRESSIVELY DECREASE SENSITIVITY TO ETHANOL. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF LOCAL PROTEIN KNOCKDOWN ON THE REINFORCING AND ANXIOLYTIC EFFECTS OF ETHANOL. ALTOGETHER, THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY NOVEL MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS OF VULNERABILITY TO ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS.

IN ADDITION, OUR PRIOR RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC) AND LIMBIC-HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (LHPA) STRESS AXIS, WHICH INTERACT WITH THE BRAIN'S REWARD CIRCUIT, AS A POTENTIAL SEX-SENSITIVE FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK ASSOCIATED WITH A PERSON'S LOW LEVEL OF RESPONSE (LR) TO ALCOHOL. UNTIL NOW, FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI)-BASED ASSOCIATIONS WITH LR HAVE ANALYZED BRAIN REGIONAL ALCOHOL EFFECTS IN A SEGREGATED MANNER AND DID NOT CONSIDER THE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY (FC) BETWEEN THE PFC-LHPA NETWORK AND SEX DIFFERENCES IN THESE BRAIN CIRCUITS.  THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO CONDUCT A SERIES OF POST-HOC SECONDARY ANALYSES, TWO PILOT FEASIBILITY TRIALS, AND A FULL HUMAN LABORATORY STUDY THAT COMBINES NEUROENDOCRINE AND ETHANOL-FMRI APPROACHES TO PROBE THE PFC-LHPA NETWORK THROUGH A LENS FOCUSED ON LR, ALCOHOL'S STIMULATING EFFECTS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACUTE TOLERANCE, AND POTENTIAL SEX DIFFERENCES. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT LOW LR TO ALCOHOL WILL BE CORRELATED WITH DECREASED FC BETWEEN THE PFC-LHPA NETWORK AND THAT DISRUPTED FC WILL BE GREATER IN WOMEN THAN MEN.

THAT EXPERIMENT WILL ALLOW US TO TEST WHETHER LOW- (N = 30) AND HIGH-LR (N = 30) WOMEN (50%) AND MEN DIFFER IN THEIR STRESS HORMONE RESPONSE TO A BINGE-LIKE DRINKING EPISODE, AND HOW THOSE ALCOHOL SENSITIVITY AND STRESS HORMONE RESPONSES CORRELATE WITH FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN THE PFC-LHPA NETWORK.

THIS RESEARCH IS AIMED AT IMPROVING SERVICES FOR AUD BY USING EHRS TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL CARE AND POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT IN URBAN PRIMARY CARE BASED AT A HOSPITAL WITH AN ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION (ACO) IN A DIVERSE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. THE OVER-ARCHING GOAL OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT (RACE-RECORDS FOR ALCOHOL CARE ENHANCEMENT) IS TO USE DATA ALREADY BEING COLLECTED IN ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE IN EHRS TO IMPROVE CLINICAL IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF PEOPLE WITH AUDS.

ALCOHOLIC CHRONIC PANCREATITIS (ACP) IS A SERIOUS FIBRO-INFLAMMATORY DISORDER RESULTING IN EXOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY AND SUCH SEVERE CO-MORBIDITIES AS DIABETES AND PANCREATIC CANCER. SEVERAL PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF CHRONIC ALCOHOL USE DIE EVEN BEFORE THE DISEASE BECOMES CLINICALLY MANIFESTED. THE EXOCRINE PANCREAS, WHICH CONSTITUTES ~85% OF THE GLAND, IS A PRIME TARGET OF ALCOHOL TOXICITY. ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF ALCOHOL CONSUMED ARE KEY FACTORS DRIVING PATHOGENESIS OF ACP, THE MECHANISM AND METABOLIC BASIS OF ACP ARE COMPLEX AND STILL NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. BESIDES, NO EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTICS FOR ACP IS AVAILABLE FOR THE CLINICS. CHRONIC ALCOHOL (ETHANOL, ETOH) CONSUMPTION IN HUMANS IMPAIRS HEPATIC ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE (ADH) AND INCREASES FATTY INFILTRATION AND FORMATION OF FATTY ACID ETHYL ESTERS (FAEES, NONOXIDATIVE METABOLITES OF ETOH) IN THE PANCREAS.

FURTHERMORE, ETOH-INDUCED AMPKA DEACTIVATION AND REDUCED EXPRESSION OF CPT1A WAS ATTENUATED BY AMPKA AGONIST. THEREFORE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ATTENUATION OF CHRONIC ETOH-INDUCED INHIBITION OF PANCREATIC CPT1A BY AMPKA AGONIST PREVENTS DYSREGULATED PANCREATIC LIPID PHENOTYPE ALONG WITH FORMATION OF FAEES AND ASSOCIATED LIPOTOXIC INFLAMMATION, AND FIBROSIS IN ALCOHOLIC CHRONIC PANCREATITIS.

THE FLY NFB GENE CALLED DIF IS AN OUTPUT OF THE TOLL SIGNALING PATHWAY IN ADULT FLIES. DIF MODULATES ETHANOL SENSITIVITY\u2014 INCREASED DIF ACTIVITY REDUCES SENSITIVITY, WHILE DECREASED DIF INCREASES SENSITIVITY. BECAUSE NFB IS A WELL- KNOWN TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, IT HAS BEEN AXIOMATIC THAT ITS EFFECTS ARE PRODUCED BY AN ACTION IN THE NUCLEUS. IN ADDITION TO THE WELL-KNOWN NUCLEAR AND CYTOPLASMIC LOCATIONS, NFB HAS ALSO BEEN OBSERVED AT THE POSTSYNAP- TIC DENSITY. IN MAMMALS, SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS CAUSING THE TRANSLOCATION OF NFB FROM THE SYNAPSE TO THE NUCLEUS WHERE IT MODIFIES GENE EXPRESSION IN WAYS THAT ALTER SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY. HOWEVER, FROM DROSOPHILA THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT NFB PROTEINS CAN DIRECTLY MODULATE THE SYNAPTIC MACHINERY. THE DIF GENE PRODUCES TWO NFB PROTEIN ISOFORMS BY ALTERNATIVE MRNA SPLICING. THESE ARE DIFA AND DIFB. THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS DIFB. THE DIFB ISOFORM IS ONLY EXPRESSED IN DROSOPHILA CNS NEURONS, WHERE IT IS SPECIFIC TO THE MUSHROOM BODIES (WELL KNOWN TO INFLUENCE ETHANOL BEHAVIORS), ANTENNAL LOBES, AND THE SUBESOPHAGEAL GAN- GLION OF THE BRAIN. THE DIFB ISOFORM LACKS A NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION SIGNAL AND A TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATION DOMAIN. DIFB BIOCHEMICALLY CO-FRACTIONATES WITH A SYNAPTIC PROTEIN AND AWAY FROM A NUCLEAR PROTEIN.

YET, EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY FOUND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE WITH AUD ARE NOT RECEIVING ANY EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS. ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN UNTREATED AUD IS THE NEED FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT TO ADDRESS THE ACUTE AND CHRONIC EFFECTS OF HEAVY DRINKING, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN THE NUMBER OF ALCOHOL-RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS TO INCREASE BY 61.6% FROM 3.1 MILLION TO 5.0 MILLION. THIS MAKES THE ED AN IMPORTANT AND TIMELY SETTING TO ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS WITH AUD TO ENTER ADDICTION TREATMENT AS EVIDENCED BY THE SUCCESS OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS LIKE SCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT (SBIRT). HOWEVER, SBIRT HAS NOT BEEN AS IMPACTFUL FOR THOSE WITH SEVERE AUD, AND IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR MANY EDS TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT AND SUSTAIN BRIEF INTERVENTIONS. AS SUCH, MORE EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE ED SETTING TO ADDRESS AUD ARE CRITICALLY NEEDED. KETAMINE HAS EMERGED AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR AUD. KETAMINE HAS GARNERED INTEREST DUE TO ITS POTENTIAL IN TREATING PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, RAPIDLY DIMINISHING DEPRESSIVE AND SUICIDAL SYMPTOMS AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION. SUB-ANESTHETIC DOSES OF KETAMINE ADMINISTERED IN EITHER SINGLE OR MULTIPLE SESSIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH PSYCHOTHERAPY HAS SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS FOR PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOL, OPIOID, AND COCAINE USE DISORDERS. A MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF KETAMINE IS THAT IT IS ALREADY AN ACCEPTED PHARMACOTHERAPY USED ROUTINELY IN THE ED FOR PROCEDURAL SEDATION, AGITATION, AND ACUTE PAIN. IF KETAMINE COULD BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR AUD IN THE ED, THE APPROACH WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH SCREENING, TREATMENT INITIATION, AND REFERRAL (STIR) WHICH MAY BE MORE BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS WITH SEVERE AUD THAN THE TRADITIONAL SBIRT APPROACH. HOWEVER THERE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN UNDERSTANDING THE SAFETY OF ED-INITIATED KETAMINE IN IMPROVING AUD-RELATED OUTCOMES FOR THOSE WHO SEEK DETOXIFICATION. TO FILL THIS NEED, WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT A PILOT DOUBLE-BLIND PLACEBO-CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL WITH THE PRIMARY AIM OF ASSESSING THE SAFETY OF ADMINISTERING KETAMINE IN THE ED TO AUD PATIENTS SEEKING ADMISSION TO AN INPATIENT DETOXIFICATION UNIT.

CRF IS AN EXCITATORY STRESS NEUROPEPTIDE THAT ORCHESTRATES STRESS RESPONSES, WHILE NPY MAY ACT AS AN INHIBITORY OR EXCITATORY NEUROPEPTIDE.

SUBSTANTIAL OVERLAP BETWEEN AUD AND CP IN TERMS OF NEUROLOGICAL DYSREGULATION HAS BEEN REPORTED SUGGESTING THAT GENETIC INFLUENCES MAY UNDERLIE THE CO-OCCURRENCE OF AUD AND CP.

MOST HCC PATIENTS HAVE CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE RESULTING MAINLY FROM HCV/HBV INFECTION, CHRONIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION OR AFLATOXIN EXPOSURE. ALTHOUGH MOST PATIENTS THAT DEVELOP HCC HAVE CIRRHOSIS OR HEPATITIS, THE MECHANISMS PROMOTING HCC DIFFER BETWEEN PATHOLOGIES SUCH THAT NOT ALL CASES SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME. THIS PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS THAT PROMOTE HCC DUE TO CHRONIC ETHANOL EXPOSURE, A FORM OF HCC THAT IS ON THE RISE AS HCV AND HBV INFECTIONS ARE BEING BETTER PREVENTED AND TREATED. IN PARTICULAR, THIS PROPOSAL IS FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING CHROMOSOME 8Q24 AMPLIFICATION THAT IS OBSERVED MORE FREQUENTLY IN ALCOHOL-INDUCED HCC. BECAUSE C-MYC RESIDES ON THIS AMPLIFIED REGION, WE PROPOSE THAT AT LATER STAGES OF HCC, CHROMOSOME 8Q24 IS AMPLIFIED LEADING TO HIGH C-MYC LEVELS. THE HIGH MYC PROMOTES MIZ1 TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSION AND LOSS OF THE EPITHELIAL PHENOTYPE AND ACQUISITION OF MESENCHYMAL CELL TRAITS. CONCOMITANTLY, THE HIGH C-MYC ACTIVATES ZEB1 EXPRESSION DRIVING CELLS THROUGH THE EPITHELIAL TO MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION (EMT) FURTHER REPRESSING THE EPITHELIAL PHENOTYPE. AS CELLS METASTASIZE AND COLONIZE AT SECONDARY SITES, EPITHELIAL TRAITS ARE PARTIALLY REACQUIRED AS CELLS PROGRESS THROUGH THE MESENCHYMAL TO EPITHELIAL TRANSITION (MET). OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE TEMPORAL EXPRESSION PATTERNS OF C-MYC, ZEB1 AND MIZ1 AND EPITHELIAL VS. MESENCHYMAL TRAITS ARE UNIQUE IN PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOL-INDUCED HCC AND CAN PREDICT PROGNOSIS, DRUG RESISTANCE AND POTENTIAL TREATMENT STRATEGIES. IN AIM 1 WE ASK TWO MAJOR QUESTIONS: 1) DOES 8Q24 AMPLIFICATION DRIVE EMT IN ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED HCC? AND 2) DO METASTATIC LESIONS REACQUIRE A MORE EPITHELIAL PHENOTYPE? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, WE WILL EXAMINE PROTEIN EXPRESSION PATTERNS USING IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL (IHC) STAINING OF PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED HUMAN HCC RESECTIONS (TO ANSWER QUESTION 1) AND AFFECTED LYMPH NODES AND METASTATIC LESIONS (TO ANSWER QUESTION 2). STAINING WILL BE CORRELATED TO CANCER STAGE, CLINICOPATHOLOGIC VARIABLES, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND PATIENT RESPONSES TO TREATMENT.

WE WILL DETERMINE IF TARGETING HEPATIC ASPH USING AN AAV STRATEGY WILL EXACERBATE DNA DAMAGE AND CELL DEATH IN THE HEPATOCYTES OF ETHANOL-FED MICE. FURTHERMORE, WE INVESTIGATE IF OVEREXPRESSION OF ASPH PROTECTS HEPATOCYTES IN AN ALD MODEL. IN AIM 2, WE WILL DECIPHER THE MECHANISM BY WHICH ASPH PROTECTS HEPATOCYTES FROM DNA DAMAGE INDUCED CELL DEATH. WE WILL DETERMINE HOW ASPH IS INVOLVED IN ETHANOL-MEDIATED DNA DAMAGE BY USING CRISPR/CAS9 TO KNOCK OUT ASPH OR ECTOPICALLY EXPRESSING ASPH VIA A LENTIVIRAL SYSTEM. TO DELINEATE THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THIS REGULATION, WE WILL DETERMINE HOW THE ENZYMATIC FUNCTIONS OF ASPH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASPH-MEDIATED DNA DAMAGE RESPONSES AND CELL DEATH.

THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR NOVEL THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS THAT, RATHER THAN MANAGING SYMPTOMS, REVERSE ALCOHOL-INDUCED NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES. ONE EFFECT THAT ALCOHOL, AND MYRIAD OTHER ADDICITIVE DRUGS, PRODUCE IN THE BRAIN, IS THE DISRUPTION OF LONG-TERM SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION (LTD), PARTICULARLY THE PRESYNAPTIC FORM OF LTD THAT OCCURS AT CORTICOSTRIATAL SYNAPSES. THE STRIATUM IS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPULSIVE AND HABITUAL BEHAVIORS, INCLUDING DRUG ADDICTION. DRUG-INDUCED DISRUPTION OF LTD IN DORSOLATERAL STRIATUM (DLS) IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED HABITUAL BEHAVIOR WHEREAS LTD RESTORATION RESTORES DRUG-DISRUPTED GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR. WE HAVE FOUND THAT ALCOHOL DISRUPTS STRIATAL PRESYNAPTIC MU OPIOID RECEPTOR (MOR)-MEDIATED LTD THAT, IN THE DLS, OCCURS EXCLUSIVELY AT ANTERIOR INSULAR CORTEX INPUTS (AIC-DLS SYNAPSES). MOR-SHORT-TERM DEPRESSION AT THALAMIC STRIATAL INPUTS ARE UNAFFECTED BY ALCOHOL EXPOSURE. IDENTIFYING THE MOLECULAR CHANGES THAT OCCUR PRESYNAPTICALLY FOLLOWING ALCOHOL EXPOSURE AT AIC-DLS SYNAPSES, BUT NOT AT THALAMOSTRIATAL SYNAPSES, MAY REVEAL NEW TARGETS FOR PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS IN ALCOHOL USE DISORDER AND ADDICTION.

RECENT RESULTS FROM OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES SHOW THAT KNOCK-IN MICE EXPRESSING ETHANOL RESISTANT GLUN2A N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE RECEPTORS (NMDARS) DRINK THE SAME AS WILD-TYPE MICE UNDER BASELINE CONDITIONS BUT, UNLIKE THEIR WILD-TYPE COUNTERPARTS, FAIL TO ESCALATE THEIR DRINKING FOLLOWING REPEATED CYCLES OF CHRONIC INTERMITTENT ETHANOL EXPOSURE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT GLUN2A NMDARS PLAY A KEY ROLE FOR IN THE LOSS OF CONTROL OVER DRINKING OBSERVED IN ALCOHOL DEPENDENT SUBJECTS. IMPORTANTLY, A SIMILAR LACK OF ESCALATED DRINKING IS OBSERVED FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION OF INHIBITORS OF ZINC-DEPENDENT MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES (MMPS) EITHER I.C.V. OR DIRECTLY INTO THE CENTRAL NUCLEUS OF THE AMYGDALA (CEA). MMPS ARE KEY MEDIATORS OF NMDA-MEDIATED FORMS OF SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY WHERE THEY REMODEL THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX TO SUPPORT NEW GROWTH AND ENLARGEMENT OF GLUTAMATERGIC DENDRITIC SPINES. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE TEST THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS THAT MMPS AND ETHANOL-SENSITIVE GLUN2A NMDARS IN THE CEA ARE CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN THE TRANSITION TO HEAVY DRINKING THAT IS A HALLMARK OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE. IN AIM 1, WE USE SLICE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, IN VIVO ZYMOGRAPHY AND WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CIE-INDUCED CHANGES IN CEA NEURAL SIGNALING AND MMP ACTIVITY ARE ABSENT IN THE GLUN2A KNOCK-IN MICE. IN AIM 2, WE USE CRISPR EXPRESSING AAVS AND GUIDE RNAS TARGETING THE GLUN2A GENE TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE CIE-INDUCED INCREASES IN DRINKING AND MMP ACTIVITY REQUIRES FUNCTIONAL GLUN2A NMDARS IN THE CEA. THE FINDINGS FROM THESE NOVEL STUDIES WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL DATA TO SUPPORT A FUTURE R01 GRANT APPLICATION FOCUSED ON DETERMINING WHICH CEA CELL TYPES DRIVE THE ALTERED DRINKING PHENOTYPE OF THE GLUN2A KNOCK-IN MICE AND WHETHER THEIR EXPRESSION IN OTHER KEY ADDICTION-RELATED BRAIN AREAS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS EFFECT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "04a78f04-ee86-46df-5fbf-c71e46ed8479-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R21AA030159_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151949265, "Award ID": "R21AA030153", "Award Amount": 455835.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-07", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "SMARTPHONE SENSORS TO DETECT SHIFTS TOWARD HEALTHY BEHAVIOR DURING ALCOHOL TREATMENT - ABSTRACT BINGE DRINKING (4+/5+ DRINKS/OCCASION FOR FEMALES/MALES) INCREASES RISK FOR PREVENTABLE ALCOHOL-RELATED CONSEQUENCES, PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG ADULTS (AGES 18-25).

CANNABIDIOL (CBD), ONE OF THE MAIN PHYTOCANNABINOIDS IN THE CANNABIS SATIVA PLANT, IS A POTENTIALLY PROMISING CANDIDATE PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR YOUTH AUD.

CURRENTLY LACKING, HOWEVER, IS IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED. IN PARTICULAR, UNDERSTANDING THE CELL AND MOLECULAR PROCESSES MEDIATING THE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL IS OF GREAT INTEREST AND COULD LEAD TO NOVEL THERAPIES FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.  MOST OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ARE CAUSED BY ARTERIOSCLEROSIS, A THICKENING AND STIFFENING OF ARTERY WALLS, THAT MAY LEAD TO BLOOD FLOW BLOCKAGE RESULTING IN HEART ATTACK OR STROKE. ARTERIOSCLEROSIS DEVELOPS IN AREAS WHERE THE ENDOTHELIAL LINING BECOMES ACTIVATED OR DAMAGED IN RESPONSE TO INJURIOUS STIMULI. EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ENDOTHELIAL CELLS, BY UNDERGOING A CHANGE IN PHENOTYPE TO A MYOFIBROBLAST IN A PROCESS KNOWN AS ENDOTHELIAL-TO-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION (ENDMT), MAY THEMSELVES BE KEY DRIVERS OF ARTERIOSCLEROSIS. THIS RAISES THE EXCITING POSSIBILITY OF A NOVEL CELL MECHANISM INVOLVED IN VASCULAR PATHOLOGY. CRUCIALLY, NO INFORMATION EXISTS AS TO WHETHER ALCOHOL, A KNOWN MODULATOR OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, MIGHT REGULATE ENDMT IN THIS CONTEXT, A QUESTION OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST AND THE FOCUS OF OUR EXPLORATORY PROPOSAL.

THE SKELETON IS A SIGNIFICANT TARGET ORGAN FOR THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL BECAUSE IT SUFFERS ALCOHOL-RELATED DAMAGE IN TWO DISTINCT WAYS; BOTH DIRECTLY FROM EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, AND INDIRECTLY DUE TO THE INCREASED RISK FOR TRAUMATIC INJURY CAUSED BY ALCOHOL DRINKING BEHAVIOR. FRACTURE NONUNION IS A CONDITION WHERE A BONE FRACTURE INJURY FAILS TO HEAL NORMALLY REQUIRING SURGICAL INTERVENTION AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE RISK FOR THIS SERIOUS CLINICAL COMPLICATION. CURRENTLY, CLINICAL OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH A NON-HEALING FRACTURE SUCH AS SURGICAL GRAFTING OF AUTOGENOUS OR DE-MINERALIZED BONE PREPARATIONS EACH HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. OBTAINING AUTOGENOUS BONE GRAFT IS EFFECTIVELY A SEPARATE SURGICAL PROCEDURE AT RISK FOR ANOTHER SET COMPLICATIONS AND DE-MINERALIZED BONE PREPARATIONS ARE UNRELIABLE. NORMAL FRACTURE HEALING IS A REGENERATIVE PROCESS THAT UTILIZES STEM CELLS TO REBUILD NEW BONE AT THE INJURY SITE.

THIS WILL BE THE FIRST EXAMINATION OF WHETHER ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AT THE TIME OF INJURY AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF STEM CELLS TO HEAL A BONE FRACTURE. THE STUDY WILL ALSO EXAMINE A POTENTIAL MECHANISM THAT CAUSES ALCOHOL TO INHIBIT STEM CELLS FROM DIFFERENTIATING INTO CELL TYPES REQUIRED FOR NORMAL FRACTURE REPAIR.

NOTABLY, BINGE ALCOHOL USE (BAU) AND TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) REPRESENT TWO OF THE STRONGEST ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISABILITIES.

THUS, SLEEP/WAKE HOMEOSTASIS CAN BE BOTH A CULPRIT AND TARGET FOR THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION, BUT REPRESENTS A MAJOR MISSED OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY IN BASIC RESEARCH BUT ALSO FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE. THIS IS DUE TO THE LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSE-EFFECT BETWEEN CHRONIC TBI/ BAU PATHOLOGY AND CIRCADIAN/SLEEP DYSFUNCTION.

FURTHER, YOUNG ADULTS NOT ATTENDING COLLEGE, WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FROM NON-WHITE RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS, MAY BE PARTICULARLY UNDERSERVED WITH RESPECT TO ALCOHOL SCREENING AND INTERVENTION EFFORTS. AS SUCH, IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE EXPAND ALCOHOL SCREENING STRATEGIES TO REACH NON-COLLEGE YOUNG ADULTS, A TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUP. SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES (SNS; E.G., TWITTER, INSTAGRAM) ARE EXCITING PLATFORMS THROUGH WHICH TO IDENTIFY AT-RISK YOUNG ADULTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, MANY OF WHOM USE SNS. CONSISTENT WITH SELF-PRESENTATION THEORY, IT IS COMMON FOR YOUNG ADULTS TO PUBLICLY POST ABOUT SERIOUS ALCOHOL-RELATED CONSEQUENCES (E.G., ALCOHOL-RELATED BLACKOUTS), WHICH MAY REFLECT THEIR ACTUAL DRINKING BEHAVIOR AND THEREFORE SIGNAL THE NEED FOR INTERVENTION.

WHILE CHRONIC ALCOHOL ABUSE ALONE CAUSES AC, CLINICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT ALCOHOL CAN EXACERBATE CARDIAC DYSFUNCTION RESULTING FROM OTHER CAUSES OF CARDIAC INJURY OR STRESS. ALCOHOL ABUSE ALSO INCREASES THE RISK OF HYPERTENSION AND HEART FAILURE, WITH AS MANY AS ONE THIRD OF ALL DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHIES ATTRIBUTED TO AC. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CARDIAC FIBROSIS APPEARS TO BE A KEY MECHANISM OF AC DYSFUNCTION, AS FIBROSIS IMPAIRS VENTRICULAR FILLING AND IMPEDES CARDIOMYOCYTE CONTRACTION.

THEREFORE, THE MPI PROPOSE DEVELOPMENTAL WORK ON A METHOD FOR ASSESSING AMBULATORY ALCOHOL RESPONSES THAT COMBINES SMARTPHONE-BASED HIGH-RESOLUTION ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (HR-EMA) WITH NEW-GENERATION, WRIST-WORN ALCOHOL BIOSENSORS (BACTRACK SKYN\u2122) TO PROVIDE OBJECTIVE VERIFICATION OF ALCOHOL USE.

FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDER (FASD) IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE RESULTING FROM PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE), IMPACTING BETWEEN 1-5% OF THE US POPULATION AND PERHAPS MORE THAN 630,000 CHILDREN GLOBALLY EACH YEAR. WHEN ASSESSING FOR FASD THE FOLLOWING FACIAL FEATURES MUST BE EVALUATED AS PART OF THE SCREENING/DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS: PALPEBRAL FISSURE LENGTH (PFL), THINNESS OF THE UPPER VERMILLION, AND THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE PHILTRUM. PFL IS TYPICALLY ASSESSED WITH A METRIC RULER OR PHOTOMETRICALLY, WHILE THE LIP AND PHILTRUM ARE EVALUATED AGAINST A SERIES OF FIVE LIKERT SCALE PHOTOS. EACH OF THESE TRADITIONAL ASSESSMENTS HAS METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS, OFTEN RESULTING IN UNRELIABLE APPLICATION TO SPECIFIC DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA. THERE IS ALSO A RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO DIAGNOSE FASD BECAUSE THEY DON\u2019T FEEL CONFIDENT IN THEIR SKILLS IN ASSESSING THESE FEATURES, RESULTING IN UNDER- OR MISDIAGNOSIS. FURTHERMORE, THE NUMBER OF AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS IS FAR GREATER THAN THE CAPACITY OF EXPERT DIAGNOSTICIANS, ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING THE GLOBAL IMPACT OF PAE.

A SMARTPHONE APP, MORPHEUSQ, HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO MAKE THE ASSESSMENT OF THESE FACIAL FEATURES EASIER, AS WELL AS MORE RELIABLE. THE FIRST AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE IF INDIVIDUALS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT FASD, BUT NOT EXPERT IN THE PHYSICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE FACIAL FEATURES INVOLVED IN FASD, CAN USE MORPHEUSQ TO OBTAIN SIMILAR FACIAL MEASURES AS THOSE OBTAINED BY EXPERT DYSMORPHOLOGISTS USING TRADITIONAL APPROACHES.

MULTIPLE LITERATURES SUPPORT THAT THESE PROCESSES ARE MEDIATED IN PART BY A DYNAMIC NEUROCARDIAC FEEDBACK LOOP TERMED THE BAROREFLEX, AND THAT BREATHING PACED AT A RESONANCE FREQUENCY OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM (~0.1HZ) MODULATES PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO EXTERNAL STIMULI.

THIS COMPLEXITY ALSO LIKELY EXPLAINS WHY THERE ARE SO FEW EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR TREATING ALD. THEREFORE, A MAJOR UNANSWERED QUESTION FOR THE ALCOHOL FIELD IS \u2013 WHAT ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, METABOLIC IMPAIRMENTS, AND/OR MOLECULAR DISTURBANCES ARE REQUIRED FOR LIVER PATHOLOGY TO OCCUR IN THE ALCOHOL CONSUMER? A VITAL TEMPORAL INTEGRATOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI, METABOLISM, AND CELLULAR TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL IS THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM. AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL, 24-H CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS ARE DRIVEN BY A TRANSCRIPTIONAL-TRANSLATIONAL FEEDBACK LOOP SYSTEM. THIS MOLECULAR CLOCK MECHANISM INVOLVES ACTIVATION OF CORE CLOCK GENES AND MANY DOWNSTREAM CLOCK-OUTPUT GENES BY THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATORS BMAL1 AND CLOCK. THIS MOLECULAR CLOCK MECHANISM ENSURES THAT SPECIFIC CELLULAR AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES OCCUR AT THE CORRECT TIME OF DAY.

INSOMNIA, A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN ITS OWN RIGHT, IS HIGHLY PREVALENT AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH AUD. BOTH AUD AND INSOMNIA ARE PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC IN WOMEN, AS WOMEN HAVE A 40% HIGHER INSOMNIA RISK THAN MEN, AND INCIDENCE OF AUD IS INCREASING AMONG WOMEN AT ALARMING RATES. AUD AND INSOMNIA HAVE A BIDIRECTIONAL AND FEED-FORWARD RELATIONSHIP, SUCH THAT EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION NEGATIVELY IMPACTS SLEEP, AND DISRUPTED SLEEP CONTRIBUTES SUBSTANTIALLY TO ALCOHOL-RELATED PROBLEMS. MOREOVER, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGESTS THAT THIS ASSOCIATION MAY BE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED IN WOMEN. IMPORTANTLY, INSOMNIA OFTEN PRECEDES PROBLEMATIC DRINKING IN BOTH ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS. AS SUCH, INSOMNIA SERVES AS A POTENTIAL INTERVENTION TARGET FOR HAZARDOUS DRINKING. THE RECOMMENDED FIRST-LINE INSOMNIA TREATMENT - COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I) - HOLDS PROMISE AS A THERAPY THAT MAY REDUCE ALCOHOL USE VIA IMPROVED SLEEP. CBT-I TRAINED PRACTITIONERS, HOWEVER, ARE RARE, AND THE MULTIPLE REQUIRED VISITS MAY NOT BE COVERED BY INSURANCE. ONE SOLUTION TO THESE OBSTACLES IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFICACIOUS, ACCESSIBLE ELECTRONIC COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (E-CBT-I). FOR THIS PROJECT, WE WILL UTILIZE SLEEP HEALTHY USING THE INTERNET (SHUTI), THE MOST WIDELY USED AND WELL-VALIDATED VERSION OF E-CBT-I, IN A SAMPLE OF HEAVY DRINKING, COMMUNITY DWELLING ADULTS WITH INSOMNIA. WE HAVE EXCITING PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWING THAT SHUTI IMPROVES SLEEP AND REDUCES ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN THIS POPULATION.

FOR THE ACTIVE TREATMENT CONDITION (N=50) PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE 9 WEEKS TO COMPLETE THE 6-WEEK SHUTI PROGRAM. IN THE CONTROL CONDITION (N=50), PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO A WEB-BASED SLEEP EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR THE SAME TIME PERIOD. BOTH PROGRAMS WILL BE ACCESSED THROUGH THE INTERNET AND WILL CONTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT SLEEP AND SLEEP HYGIENE; ONLY THE SHUTI GROUP WILL RECEIVE FEEDBACK AND TARGETED RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON SLEEP DIARY DATA.

THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO EVALUATE DAILY FLUCTUATIONS IN SALIVARY ESTRADIOL AND PROGESTERONE OVER THE COURSE OF A FEMALE\u2019S COMPLETE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ITS EFFECT ON (A) DAILY AFFECTIVE PROCESSES AND (B) ALCOHOL REINFORCEMENT AS WELL AS TO EXPLORE THE MODERATING ROLE OF ALCOHOL USE ON THESE ASSOCIATIONS. AN ADDITIONAL EXPLORATORY AIM IS TO EXPLORE WHETHER AFFECTIVE PROCESSES MEDIATE THE LINK BETWEEN OVARIAN HORMONES AND ALCOHOL REINFORCEMENT (I.E., FEED-FORWARD ASSOCIATIONS).

IT MAY AFFECT NEURONAL ACTIVITIES IN THE CIRCUITS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALCOHOL REWARD VALUE OR ALCOHOL MODULATORY PROPERTIES, THEREBY CHANGING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. THIS PROJECT EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITY OF REDUCING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION BY CHANGING BRAIN PH. WE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT KNOCKOUT MICE LACKING THE PH-REGULATING TRANSPORTER NBCN1 FAIL TO MAINTAIN NORMAL PH IN NEURONS, CAUSING DECREASED INTRACELLULAR PH AND DECREASED CEREBROSPINAL FLUID PH. INTERESTINGLY, THESE MICE DRINK MORE ALCOHOL AND DEVELOP AN INCREASE IN THE REWARD VALUE OF ALCOHOL. FURTHERMORE, NBCN1 IS DOWNREGULATED IN MICE CHRONICALLY FED WITH ALCOHOL AND HUMANS WITH ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD). THUS, ABNORMAL FUNCTION IN NBCN1 NOT ONLY INFLUENCES ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, BUT IS ALSO INDUCED BY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS BASED ON OUR PREVIOUS AND PRELIMINARY STUDIES IS THAT ALCOHOL CAUSES NBCN1 DOWNREGULATION AND THIS DOWNREGULATION REDUCES BRAIN PH AND SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASES ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON THE ROLE OF NBCN1-MEDIATED PH REGULATION IN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND TO PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPMENT OF PH-DEPENDENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION. ACHIEVING THIS GOAL WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING PROPENSITY TOWARD ALCOHOLIC KETOACIDOSIS (AKA) AND DEVELOPING A PREVENTION STRATEGY. AKA IS A METABOLIC ACIDOSIS INDUCED AFTER BINGE OR CHRONIC ALCOHOL ABUSE FOLLOWED BY FASTING. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY HYPERKETONEMIA AND HIGH ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT HYPERGLYCEMIA, AND CAUSES NAUSEA, VOMITING, AND ABDOMINAL PAIN. TWO SPECIFIC AIMS ARE SET TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL. AIM 1 WILL EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF PH RESTORATION ON INCREASED ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN NBCN1 KNOCKOUT MICE. THE EFFICACY OF PH IN REDUCING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND NBCN1 INVOLVEMENT IN THIS PH EFFECT WILL BE INVESTIGATED. A MECHANISTIC APPROACH WILL THEN BE USED BY INJECTING NBCN1 TO THE MOUSE BRAIN, PRIMARILY IN THE MESOLIMBIC SYSTEM. AIM 2 WILL EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF PH ON AKA IN MICE. WE DEVELOPED A MOUSE MODEL OF AKA USING A CLINICALLY RELEVANT ALCOHOL FEEDING PROCEDURE. WE WILL TEST WHETHER ADJUSTING SYSTEMIC PH ATTENUATES AKA AND WHETHER NBCN1 IS INVOLVED. BICARBONATE WILL BE ADDED TO THE DIET AND AKA INDUCTION AND SEVERITY WILL BE MEASURED. WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE NBCN1 EXPRESSION AND ACTIVITY DURING AKA DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECTS OF NBCN1 OVEREXPRESSION IN THE MESOLIMBIC SYSTEM WILL BE ASSESSED. THE RESULTS WILL PROVIDE UNPRECEDENTED INFORMATION ABOUT THE PH EFFECTS ON ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND NBCN1 INVOLVEMENT IN PRODUCING THESE EFFECTS.

ETHANOL) HAS BEEN LINKED TO THE ETIOLOGY OF SEVERAL CANCERS1-3, HOWEVER, TO DATE THERE IS ALMOST NO KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL EXPOSURE ON RESPONSES TO IMMUNOTHERAPY. ETHANOL ABUSE DISRUPTS IMMUNE FUNCTION, WHICH COULD SPECIFICALLY IMPACT IMMUNOTHERAPY RESPONSES IN SEVERAL CANCERS. THIS PROMPTED THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY TO CALL FOR STUDIES INTO THE IMPACT OF CHRONIC ETHANOL ON IMMUNOTHERAPY4. WE FIND THAT CHRONIC ETHANOL REDUCES ANTI-PD-1 EFFICACY AND CAUSES INTESTINAL DYSBIOSIS DURING TUMOR GROWTH IN A MANNER THAT MAY REDUCE RESPONSES TO ANTI-PD-1. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT ETHANOL IMPAIRS EFFICACY OF ANTI-PD-1 THERAPY IN MULTIPLE TUMOR TYPES VIA DYSREGULATION OF T CELL ACTIVATION AND TUMOR INGRESS. WE HYPOTHESIZE ETHANOL-INDUCED INTESTINAL DYSBIOSIS CONTRIBUTES TO THIS DYSFUNCTION.  PD-1 RECEPTOR TARGETED IMMUNOTHERAPY HAS EMERGED AS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR A VARIETY OF ADVANCED MALIGNANCIES IN A SUBSET OF RESPONSIVE PATIENTS5. TUMOR-INDUCED PD-1 LIGANDS SUPPRESS T-CELL RESPONSES AS A MEANS OF IMMUNE INVASION TO PROMOTE TUMOR GROWTH5-7. ANTI-PD-1 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (APD-1 MABS) CAN REVERSE PD-1 IMMUNOSUPPRESSION TO FACILITATE TUMOR CLEARANCE IN RESPONSIVE PATIENTS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THESE EXCITING CLINICAL RESULTS, ONLY A MINORITY OF PATIENTS RESPOND TO ANTI-PD-1 THERAPY. ANTI-PD-1 EFFICACY CAN BE INFLUENCED BY IMMUNOLOGICAL FACTORS SUCH AS T CELL INVASION INTO THE TUMOR8 AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION. CHRONIC ETHANOL USE INCREASES GUT PERMEABILITY, ALTERS PERIPHERAL CYTOKINES9, ALTERS T-CELL NUMBERS AND FUNCTION10, AND CAUSES INTESTINAL DYSBIOSIS11-13, WITH MULTIPLE BACTERIAL SPECIES DEPLETED IN ETHANOL MODELS INVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO APD-1 MABS11,12,14-18.

WE FOUND THAT CHRONIC ETHANOL-TREATED MICE (5 WEEKS) HAD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED TUMOR GROWTH AND HIGHER MORTALITY THAN APD-1 MAB TREATMENT ALONE (100% SURVIVAL IN VEHICLE + ANTI-PD-1 VS 33% SURVIVAL IN ETHANOL + ANTI-PD-1), WITH NO EFFECT OF ETHANOL ON TUMOR GROWTH WITHOUT APD-1. ETHANOL-TREATED MICE SHOWED ALTERATIONS IN PERIPHERAL AND TUMORAL T-CELL POPULATIONS.

DAMAGE TO NEURONS ALSO INCLUDES CELLS WITHIN THE RETINA, PRODUCING VISUAL SYSTEM FACETS OF THESE FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS (FASD). CRITICAL GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE REMAIN REGARDING THE SPECIFIC MECHANISMS UNDERLYING ETHANOL- MEDIATED DAMAGE TO NEURONS, AND THEIR INTRINSIC VULNERABILITIES AND NEUROPROTECTIVE FEATURES, WHICH MIGHT BE MONITORED, ENHANCED AND/OR EXPLOITED IN SOME WAY TO RESCUE NEURONS FROM DAMAGE. ONE PROPOSED CELLULAR TARGET FOR ETHANOL DAMAGE IS DISRUPTION IN NEURONS OF CRITICAL PROTEIN HOMEOSTASIS PATHWAYS INCLUDING THE UBIQUITIN SYSTEM. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULES AND MECHANISMS PRODUCING PHOTORECEPTOR NEURON DYSFUNCTION AND DEGENERATION, AND TO ELUCIDATE POTENTIAL RESCUE STRATEGIES. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF UBIQUITIN-SYSTEM IMPAIRMENT TO TISSUE DAMAGE BY ETHANOL IN THESE SPECIFIC NEURONS, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF UBIQUITIN-SYSTEM MANIPULATIONS TO RESCUE NEURONAL FUNCTION. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF OUR PROPOSAL IS THAT BINGE-LIKE ETHANOL EXPOSURE DISRUPTS FUNDAMENTAL PROTEIN TURNOVER MECHANISMS IN PHOTORECEPTOR NEURONS, UNDERMINING NORMAL CELL PROTEOSTASIS. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS BASED ON PRELIMINARY DATA FROM OUR LAB DEMONSTRATING THAT BINGE-LIKE EXPOSURE TO ETHANOL PRODUCES LOSS OF VISUAL FUNCTION IN LARVAL ZEBRAFISH, AN ADVANTAGEOUS MODEL FOR FASD, WITH PARTIAL RESCUE OF FUNCTION VIA PHARMACOLOGICAL ENHANCEMENT OF AUTOPHAGY AND THE UBIQUITIN-PROTEASOME SYSTEM; UBIQUITIN-SYSTEM IMPAIRMENT IN PHOTORECEPTOR-DERIVED CELLS AND PHOTORECEPTOR NEURONS AFTER ETHANOL EXPOSURE; AND PREVIOUSLY REPORTED EVIDENCE FOR UBIQUITIN-SYSTEM CHANGES IN THE BRAIN WITH ETHANOL. WE PLAN TO TEST OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS AND ACCOMPLISH THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL BY COMPLETING THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) DETERMINE THE EFFECTS ON UBIQUITIN-SYSTEM MANIPULATIONS ON CONE PHOTORECEPTOR NEURON FUNCTION AND PROTEOSTASIS IN THE CONTEXT OF DAMAGING EXPOSURE TO ALCOHOL; AND (2) INTERROGATE THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF UBIQUITIN-MODIFIED PROTEINS IN CONE PHOTORECEPTORS FOLLOWING ETHANOL EXPOSURE. THESE STUDIES WILL INVOLVE MOLECULAR MANIPULATIONS, INCLUDING CELL-SPECIFIC EXPRESSION OF REPORTER PROTEINS FOR UBIQUITIN- SYSTEM IMPAIRMENT AND CRISPR/CAS9 GENE DISRUPTION SPECIFICALLY IN CONE PHOTORECEPTORS; BIOCHEMISTRY; VISUAL PERFORMANCE ASSAYS; ERG RECORDINGS; AND PHOTORECEPTOR-SPECIFIC UBIQUITIN PROTEOMICS. THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THESE STUDIES ARE AN ENHANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EARLY ALCOHOL EXPOSURE, NEURONAL DAMAGE, AND THE UBIQUITIN SYSTEM, AND A MECHANISTIC FOUNDATION FOR THE

DEACETYLASE 4 IN ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE - PROJECT SUMMARY ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE (ALD) IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WORLDWIDE. ALD IS THE EIGHTH MOST COMMON CAUSE OF MORTALITY IN THE U.S. AND THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG ALL GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES. ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS (AH) IS THE PROGRESSIVE FORM OF ALD, WHICH CAN PROGRESS TO CIRRHOSIS AND HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN UNMET NEED FOR DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES FOR AH. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS HISTONE DEACETYLASES (HDACS) ARE INVOLVED IN ALCOHOL-INDUCED CELL DAMAGES. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ROLE OF EACH HDAC ISOFORM IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF AH. WE FOUND THAT HDAC4 MRNA AND PROTEIN LEVELS WERE MARKEDLY INCREASED IN THE HUMAN LIVER WITH ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS AND THE MOUSE LIVER EXPOSED TO ALCOHOL. FURTHERMORE, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT ETHANOL INCREASED HDAC4 EXPRESSION IN HUH-7 CELLS, A HUMAN HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA CELL LINE. ALSO, ETHANOL INDUCED THE EXPRESSION OF HDAC4 WITH CONCOMITANT INCREASES IN INFLAMMATION AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN MACROPHAGES, WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ATTENUATED WHEN HDAC4 WAS KNOCKED OUT OR DOWN. SIRTUIN 1 (SIRT1) IS KNOWN TO PREVENT ALCOHOL-RELATED CELL DAMAGES AND LIVER INJURY. CONSISTENTLY, WE FOUND THAT A SIRT1 INHIBITOR INCREASED INTERLEUKIN-1B (IL1B) EXPRESSION, WHEREAS A SIRT1 ACTIVATOR SIGNIFICANTLY ABOLISHED ETHANOL-INDUCED HDAC4 AND IL1B EXPRESSION IN MACROPHAGES. IT IS OF INTEREST THAT HDAC4 DEFICIENCY INCREASED SIRT1 EXPRESSION, WHILE HUMAN HDAC4 OVEREXPRESSION ELICITED THE OPPOSITE EFFECTS IN RAW 264.7 MACROPHAGES. THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS SUGGEST THE HDAC4/SIRT1 AXIS MAY PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AH. BASED ON THE STRONG PREMISE DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ESTABLISH THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT THE DELETION OF HDAC4 IN HEPATOCYTES OR MACROPHAGES INHIBITS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AH BY ALTERING HEPATIC EXPRESSION OF GENES, INCLUDING SIRT1, THAT ARE CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN ALCOHOL-INDUCED INFLAMMATION AND OXIDATIVE STRESS. WE WILL TAKE BOTH TARGETED (SIRT1 PATHWAY) AND UNTARGETED APPROACHES (GENOME-WIDE TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS) USING NOVEL MICE THAT HAVE HEPATOCYTE- OR MACROPHAGE-SPECIFIC DELETION OF HDAC4 UNDER CHRONIC-BINGE ETHANOL FEEDING (THE NIAAA MODEL) AS IN VIVO MODELS. WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS BY PURSUING THE FOLLOWING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF HEPATOCYTE AND MACROPHAGE HDAC4 IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AH AND TO EVALUATE THE HDAC4/SIRT1 AXIS FOR THE PATHOGENESIS OF AH; AND 2) TO CONDUCT A GENOME-WIDE TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY HDAC4-REGULATED GENES IN HEPATOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES THAT MEDIATE THE PATHOGENIC PROCESSES OF AH AND TO CORROBORATE THE FINDINGS USING HUMAN LIVER SPECIMENS AND PRIMARY HUMAN HEPATOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WILL PRODUCE MUCH-NEEDED INFORMATION ON THE ROLE OF HEPATOCYTE AND MACROPHAGE HDAC4 IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF AH. ALSO, THIS STUDY WILL LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW GENES/PATHWAYS, WHICH CAN BE EXPLOITED FOR FUTURE THERAPIES FOR AH.

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF APPROVED MEDICATIONS FOR AUD, BUT THE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS DO NOT RESPOND TO THESE MEDICATIONS AND NO MEDICATIONS ADDRESS THE ROLE OF STRESS.

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  THE AIM OF THIS MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF GENDER IDENTIFICATION AND GROUP DYNAMICS ON ALCOHOL-RELATED DECISION MAKING IN PEER SOCIAL CONTEXTS FOR EMERGING ADULTS. WHILE ALCOHOL USE AND CONSEQUENCES ARE HIGHEST AMONG EMERGING ADULTS (18-25 YEAR OLDS) COMPARED TO OTHER AGE GROUPS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW GENDER IDENTIFICATION AND GENDER DYNAMICS IMPACT ALCOHOL USE IN THIS POPULATION. IN HUMAN RESEARCH, SEX TYPICALLY DENOTES BIOLOGY (MALE-FEMALE) WHILE GENDER REFERS TO IDENTITY (E.G., CISGENDER [WHERE SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH AND GENDER IDENTITY MATCH], GENDER DIVERSE [WHERE SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH DOES NOT MATCH GENDER IDENTITY]). DESPITE EVIDENCE OF A NARROWING GAP IN TERMS OF SEX-BASED DRINKING PATTERNS, DAILY ALCOHOL USE AND HEAVY EPISODIC DRINKING (HED; 5+ DRINKS PER EPISODE) IS MORE COMMON FOR MALES THAN FEMALES IN EMERGING ADULTHOOD. GENDER DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS ENGAGE IN MORE HED AND HAVE GREATER ODDS OF REPORTING ALCOHOL-RELATED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES AND SUICIDAL IDEATION WHILE DRINKING THAN CISGENDER PARTICIPANTS. THE COMPOSITION OF DRINKING GROUPS, BY BOTH GENDER AND SIZE, INFLUENCE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. MIXED-GENDER GROUPS (COMPOSED OF MEN AND WOMEN) AND OTHER-GENDER GROUPS (COMPOSED OF PEOPLE WHOSE GENDER DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE DRINKER) PROMOTE GREATER ALCOHOL USE, A PHENOMENON THAT INTERACTS WITH GROUP SIZE. WOMEN MAY ALSO BE MORE LIKELY TO PERCEIVE THREATS IN SOCIAL CONTEXTS INVOLVING ALCOHOL AND ENGAGE IN PROTECTIVE BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE HARMS FROM DRINKING THAN MEN (E.G., EATING BEFORE DRINKING, LEAVING A DRINKING VENUE AT A SPECIFIC TIME). AS RESEARCH TYPICALLY FOCUSES ON PUTATIVE CISGENDER SAMPLES, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW GENDER DIVERSITY IN DRINKING GROUPS IMPACTS CONSUMPTION. WE WILL RECRUIT 260 PARTICIPANTS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 - 25 YEARS WHO ENDORSE BEING CISGENDER (N = 180) AND GENDER DIVERSE (TRANSMASCULINE, TRANSFEMININE, NONBINARY; N = 80). USING AUTOMATED SIMULATION METHODS ONLINE, WE WILL DETERMINE HOW GROUP SIZE, GENDER IDENTIFICATION AND GENDER DYNAMICS, INCLUDING PERCEIVED GENDER MATCH- MISMATCH AND GENDER CONSTELLATION OF THE GROUP, IMPACT BEHAVIORAL WILLINGNESS TO DRINK IN PEER SOCIAL CONTEXTS. USING OPEN-ENDED COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES AND STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH A SUBSET OF PARTICIPANTS (N = 80), WE WILL FURTHER IDENTIFY HOW GENDER IDENTIFICATION AND SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DRINKING CONTEXTS (GROUP SIZE, GENDER DYNAMICS) ELICIT DIFFERENTIAL RESPONDING IN TERMS OF PERCEIVED RISK FROM DRINKING AND IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL PROTECTIVE BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES, BOTH CONSIDERED PROTECTIVE AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF RISKY DRINKING. THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES OF THIS LINE OF RESEARCH ARE: 1. TO UNDERSTAND HOW GENDER DYNAMICS CONVEY RISK AND PROTECTION FOR ALCOHOL-RELATED CONSEQUENCES, AND 2. TO PREVENT GENDER- BASED HEALTH DISPARITIES RELATED TO PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN EARLY ADULTHOOD THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF TARGETED PREVENTION STRATEGIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1413e557-be0c-38db-82a9-2cbfd98a358c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R15AA029524_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151144925, "Award ID": "R15AA029256", "Award Amount": 359419.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-15", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "DETERMINING THE CAUSAL PATHWAYS OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTORS OF HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL DRINKING AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS - PROJECT SUMMARY  THE PURPOSE OF THIS R15 APPLICATION IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE BROADER ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THE EXPERIENCE OF VICTIMIZATION LEADS TO HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL DRINKING IN COLLEGE POPULATIONS. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL ALLOW FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSAL PATHWAYS BETWEEN CONTEXTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL EXPOSURES AND HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL USE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS.  HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IS A SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT LEADS TO MANY PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, SOCIAL, AND COGNITIVE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING DEATH. RECENTLY, 38% OF COLLEGE STUDENTS REPORTED ENGAGING IN BINGE DRINKING IN THE LAST MONTH AND 11.4% REPORTING HEAVY ALCOHOL USE. ALCOHOL USE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION, BULLYING, AND DISCRIMINATION, ALL OF WHICH ARE CONTEXTUAL SOCIAL EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES HAVE USED STUDY DESIGNS AND METHODS THAT ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO BIAS AND FEW HAVE EXAMINED THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT OR \u201cACTIVITY SPACE\u201d IN WHICH ALCOHOL USE OCCURS. SINCE IT IS LIKELY THAT THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE CONTEXTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL EXPOSURES AND HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL DRINKING VARIES WITHIN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS, WE WILL ASSESS WHETHER THESE RELATIONSHIPS DIFFER BY GENDER AND BY RACE/ETHNICITY. ANALYSES WILL BE PERFORMED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CAUSAL PATHWAYS BETWEEN CONTEXTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL PREDICTORS AND HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL USE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS, MORE SPECIFICALLY MEDIATION BY PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS. TO ADDRESS PREVIOUS GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL USE A SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL APPROACH THAT USES INNOVATIVE METHODS TO COLLECT MORE ACCURATE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION COMBINED WITH EXISTING AND NOVEL CAUSAL INFERENCE TECHNIQUES.  WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) CHARACTERIZE THE ACTIVITY SPACES OF COLLEGE STUDENTS AND EXAMINE HOW THEY ARE CORRELATED WITH CONTEXTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL EXPOSURES, AND ALCOHOL USE BEHAVIORS; 2) EXAMINE THE DIRECT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN (A) ENVIRONMENTAL (I.E., PLACE-BASED EXPOSURES INCLUDING PHYSICAL DISORDER, CRIME/VIOLENCE, ALCOHOL OUTLETS, SOCIAL DISORDER) AND (B) SOCIAL CONTEXTS (I.E., VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION, BULLYING, AND DISCRIMINATION) AND HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL DRINKING AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS; AND 3) ASSESS MODERATION BY GENDER AND RACE/ETHNICITY AND MEDIATION BY POTENTIAL PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONTEXTUAL (A) ENVIRONMENTAL AND (B) SOCIAL EXPOSURES AND HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL DRINKING.  THIS RESEARCH WILL ADD TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSAL PATHWAYS BETWEEN CONTEXTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL PREDICTORS AND HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL DRINKING AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS AND WILL HELP ELUCIDATE DIFFERENCES BY GENDER AND RACE/ETHNICITY.

PHASE II EXTENDS A SUCCESSFUL, LONGITUDINAL, HOME-BASED, ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM (EEG) STUDY OF MALTREATED ADOLESCENTS (N=61, 98% RETENTION IN FIRST 3 YEARS). THE ENTIRE SAMPLE (BOTH CM AND MATCHED CONTROL YOUTH) WAS RECRUITED FROM DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO MAXIMIZE MATCHING OF NEIGHBORHOOD, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, ETHNICITY AND OTHER FACTORS. EACH PARTICIPANT HAS HAD 3 ANNUAL ASSESSMENTS. WITH PHASE II, WE WILL EXPAND THE SAMPLE SIZE (FROM 60 TO 120) AND WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW ALL EXISTING PARTICIPANTS WITH 3 MORE ANNUAL HOME-BASED EEG, CM, PHENOTYPIC, BEHAVIORAL, COGNITIVE, AFFECTIVE, AND SUBSTANCE USE ASSESSMENTS FOR AGES 12-19 YEARS. THIS WILL YIELD A TOTAL OF 582 STUDY VISITS, WHICH WILL BE POWERED DO DETECT ONSET AND PEAK HED IN RELATION TO CM AND BRAIN FUNCTION. IN PHASE II, THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLE WILL BE IN LATE ADOLESCENCE, WHEN HED BEHAVIORS PEAK; SO, WE EXPECT HIGHER RATES OF HED. TASK-BASED EEG AND FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY (EA) ARE NEW FOCI BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN LINKED TO THE APPROACH- AVOIDANCE NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRAUMA AND ALCOHOL USE IN ADOLESCENTS, ADULTS, AND ACROSS SPECIES. HAVING 6 YEARS OF DATA THAT INCLUDE ONSET AND PEAK HED DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD IS VITAL FOR IDENTIFYING LONG-TERM PATTERNS AND MECHANISMS THAT MAY BE TARGETS IN PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION EFFORTS. UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BE ENGAGED ALL ASPECTS OF PHASE II INCLUDING WITH HONORS THESES, MASTER\u2019S THESES, AND DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS STUDY MEASURES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN EVALUATED OR REQUIRE THE ADDITIONAL AGE DATA PROPOSED IN PHASE II TO EXAMINE TRAJECTORIES. THEREFORE, PHASE II OF THIS PROJECT WILL CONTINUE TO DIRECTLY ENGAGE STUDENTS IN NEUROSCIENCE AND ALCOHOL USE RESEARCH AT EVERY LEVEL. IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE NOVEL NEUROSCIENCE AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING RISKS AND MECHANISMS FOR HED IN MALTREATED ADOLESCENTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "5251bb2c-492f-4971-ad47-2335f2e84fda-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R15AA028911_7529"}, {"internal_id": 126271073, "Award ID": "R15AA028910", "Award Amount": 484485.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-02-05", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "BYSTANDER INTERVENTION FOR PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE MEASURE (BIPAUM) TO REDUCE RISKY DRINKING AMONG DIVERSE COLLEGE STUDENTS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "a1b3f72b-bb6f-8fd7-5ecd-fb4c67001bdd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R15AA028910_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140659941, "Award ID": "R15AA028909", "Award Amount": 401572.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-20", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF THE EXPECTANCY CHALLENGE ALCOHOL LITERACY CURRICULUM ON REDUCING ADVERSE ALCOHOL OUTCOMES - ABSTRACT COLLEGE STUDENT ALCOHOL USE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. COLLEGE STUDENTS CONSUME ALCOHOL AT HIGHER RATES THAN THEIR NON-COLLEGE PEERS, AND THE ANNUAL CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH COLLEGE STUDENT DRINKING INCLUDE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ASSAULTS AND OVER 1,500 FATALITIES. ALTHOUGH MOST COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED EVIDENCE-BASED PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION PROGRAMS, RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT RATES OF DRINKING-RELATED HARMS HAVE CHANGED LITTLE, AND THAT MOST WIDELY USED PROGRAMS MAY NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS ONCE THOUGHT. IDENTIFYING COST-EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE AND ASSOCIATED HARMS REMAINS VITALLY IMPORTANT. BASED ON DECADES OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED RESEARCH, ALCOHOL EXPECTANCIES COULD BE A PRIME TARGET FOR DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION METHODS. EXPECTANCIES MEDIATE THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER ANTECEDENT VARIABLES, PREDICT FUTURE ALCOHOL USE, AND MAY BE A CAUSAL VARIABLE THAT DIRECTLY INFLUENCES DRINKING BEHAVIOR. EDUCATION FOCUSED ON EXPECTANCIES IS INEFFECTIVE IN PRODUCING BEHAVIOR CHANGE. USE OF EXPERIENTIAL EXPECTANCY CHALLENGE METHODS THAT INCLUDE A DRINKING EXERCISE HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN THE LABORATORY, BUT ARE IMPRACTICAL FOR WIDESPREAD USE. THE EXPECTANCY CHALLENGE ALCOHOL LITERACY CURRICULUM (ECALC) IS A 50-MINUTE INTERACTIVE PROGRAM, AND THE ONLY NON-EXPERIENTIAL EXPECTANCY CHALLENGE THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING ALCOHOL USE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS. IN STUDIES FOCUSED ON MANDATED STUDENTS, FRATERNITY AND SORORITY MEMBERS, AND FIRST YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS, ECALC HAS PRODUCED LARGER EFFECT SIZES THAN EXPERIENTIAL EXPECTANCY CHALLENGE AND ALL WIDELY USED PROGRAMS. ECALC OUTCOME STUDIES HAVE THUS FAR BEEN LIMITED TO FOUR WEEKS, BUT THE DESIGN OF ECALC SUGGESTS THAT EFFECTS MIGHT BE SUSTAINED FOR MUCH LONGER. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO EVALUATE DURATION OF ECALC EFFECTS OVER THE COURSE OF 6 MONTHS, AND TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF SMART PHONE- DELIVERED BOOSTERS ON MAINTENANCE AND ENHANCEMENT OF EFFECTS.

SPECIFIC MECHANISMS OF RISK FOR ESCALATING DRINKING IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUNG ADULTHOOD ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE CONTINUOUS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HEART AND BRAIN THROUGH THE ANS IS CRITICAL TO BASIC REGULATORY PROCESSES LIKE SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS, AS WELL AS TO RESPONSES TO STRESSORS AND REWARDS IN ONE\u2019S ENVIRONMENT. IN ADULTS WITH ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS, POORER ANS FUNCTIONING (I.E., LOWER HEART- RATE VARIABILITY [HRV] AND BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY [BRS]) ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER REPORTED CRAVING AND ALCOHOL-SEEKING BEHAVIOR; HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR HOW ANS FUNCTIONING RELATES TO HEAVY DRINKING BELOW THE THRESHOLD OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS IN ADOLESCENTS. THE APPLICATION SEEKS TO EXAMINE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS) FUNCTIONING, AS INDEXED BY CARDIOVASCULAR PROBES, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO ALCOHOL USE, CRAVING, AND CUE-REACTIVITY IN AN ADOLESCENT/YOUNG ADULT SAMPLE TO ELUCIDATE A POTENTIAL MECHANISM OF RISK IN HEAVY ALCOHOL USERS. THE CENTRAL PREMISE OF THE APPLICATION IS THAT ANS FUNCTIONING: 1) IS CRITICAL TO ONE\u2019S ABILITY TO SELF- REGULATE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE AND SPECIFICALLY REGULATE RESPONSES TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CUES RELATED TO ALCOHOL USE, AND 2) IS AFFECTED ACUTELY AND CHRONICALLY BY ALCOHOL USE, WHICH CASCADES TO NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN FUNCTIONING. QUANTIFYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALCOHOL USE AND ANS FUNCTIONING IN LATE ADOLESCENCE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN UNDERSTANDING OTHER POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION. ACCORDINGLY, THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON ASSESSING CARDIOVASCULAR INDICES OF ANS FUNCTIONING ALONG WITH SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN FUNCTIONING, AND INDIVIDUALS\u2019 AFFECT AND CUE-REACTIVITY OVER ONE MONTH. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS, THE STUDY WILL ENLIST LATE ADOLESCENT HEAVY DRINKERS (HD, N = 50; AGES 18-20) AND AGE- AND SEX- MATCHED NON-DRINKING CONTROLS (CON, N = 50) IN A 4-WEEK STUDY. RESTING-STATE HRV AND BRS WILL BE MEASURED WEEKLY (5X TOTAL), AND AFFECT RATINGS WILL BE GATHERED DAILY THROUGHOUT THE 4 WEEKS, WHILE AN ALCOHOL CUE-REACTIVITY TASK WITH SIMULTANEOUS HRV ASSESSMENT WILL BE GATHERED TWICE (FIRST AND LAST WEEK). THE PRIMARY AIMS OF THE CURRENT PROTOCOL ARE TO: 1) IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN ANS FUNCTION AND CUE-REACTIVITY OVER A MONTH BETWEEN HD AND CON, AND 2) QUANTIFY THE RELATIONS BETWEEN ANS FUNCTIONING AND CRAVING, SLEEP, AFFECT, AND SUBSTANCE USE. THE CANDIDATE WILL USE HIS TRAINING IN ANS ASSESSMENT TO TEST WHETHER HD EXHIBIT DIFFERENCES IN ANS FUNCTIONING, AFFECT, AND CUE-REACTIVITY RELATED TO THEIR ALCOHOL USE. CORROBORATING CHANGES VIA MULTIPLE MODALITIES (E.G., CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONING AND SELF-REPORTED MEASURES) WILL YIELD A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE POTENTIAL UNDERLYING MECHANISMS.

ALCOHOL USE AND ABUSE IS A CAUSAL FACTOR IN OVER 60 DIFFERENT DISEASES AND INJURIES PUTTING AN ENORMOUS HEALTH AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ON SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE. THE MAJOR SHARE OF ALCOHOL-INDUCED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALCOHOL-INDUCED END ORGAN DISEASES, INCLUDING CANCER, ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE, PANCREATITIS, OSTEOPOROSIS, DIABETES MELLITUS, HYPERTENSION, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE, ARRHYTHMIAS, STROKE, PNEUMONIA AND FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME. ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS ARE ON THE RISE IN ALL SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY AND THEY OFTEN SYNERGIZE WITH OTHER DISEASES THAT HAVE REACHED EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS INCLUDING OBESITY, DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, DRUG ABUSE AND IMMUNOLOGICAL MALADIES. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES OF THE FIELD OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, THE UNDERLYING DISEASE ETIOLOGY IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO GAIN NEW KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOLECULAR UNDERPINNINGS OF ALCOHOL-INDUCED END ORGAN DISEASES TO ACCELERATE DIAGNOSIS, PREVENTION, AND TREATMENT. IN THIS R13 APPLICATION, WE ARE SEEKING SUPPORT FOR THE GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES (GRC) ALCOHOL-INDUCED END ORGAN DISEASES 2021 AND 2023. THIS IS A RELATIVELY NEW GRC, WHICH WAS INITIATED THREE YEARS AGO HELD EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS IN 2017 AND 2019. THE OPEN FORMAT OF GRC MODEL INCLUDES SHARING SIGNIFICANT UNPUBLISHED WORK AND PROVIDES AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IN-DEPTH DISCUSSIONS WITH PEERS, NEW COLLEAGUES AND THE FUTURE GENERATION OF ALCOHOL RESEARCHERS; THIS CONFERENCE MODEL IS IDEALLY SUITED FOR PROPELLING THE FIELD TO NEW HEIGHTS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE ALCOHOL-INDUCED END ORGAN DISEASES MEETINGS ARE TO FOSTER OPEN DISCUSSION OF RESEARCH DEVELOPMENTS, ESTABLISH NEW SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATIONS, AND PROPEL THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES. THIS GRC FILLS A CRITICAL NEED IN THE FIELD FOR A CONTINUING MEETING THAT PRESENTS KEY RECENT FINDINGS ON ALCOHOL-INDUCED END ORGAN INJURY AND REPAIR IN A UNIQUE FORMAT THAT ENSURES TIME FOR IN-DEPTH DISCUSSIONS, FORMULATION OF NEW APPROACHES AND INITIATION OF NEW COLLABORATIONS. THIS CONFERENCE WILL 1) PROVIDE A FORUM THAT PROMOTES OPEN DISCUSSION OF CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH AT THE FOREFRONT OF ALCOHOL-INDUCED TISSUE INJURY, 2) FOSTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF ALCOHOL AND TISSUE INJURY INVESTIGATORS, 3) PROMOTE INTERACTION BETWEEN YOUNG AND SENIOR INVESTIGATORS, 4) FACILITATE THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS THAT WILL SHAPE THE FUTURE DIRECTIONS OF THE ALCOHOL AND TISSUE INJURY COMMUNITY AND 5) INTRODUCE BREAKTHROUGH TECHNIQUES THAT FACILITATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF MECHANISMS DRIVING ALCOHOL-INDUCED TISSUE INJURIES. WE ENVISION THE GRC ON \u201cALCOHOL INDUCED END ORGAN DISEASES\u201d WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF END ORGAN INJURIES AND STIMULATE DEVELOPMENT OF

IT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO RISK FACTORS FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE DURING THIS DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD. ONE UNDERAPPRECIATED RISK FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROBLEMATIC DRINKING IS THE SOCIAL CONTEXT IN WHICH YOUNG ADULTS CONSUME ALCOHOL. RECENT REVIEWS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN SOLITARY ALCOHOL USE (COMPARED TO THEIR SOCIAL-ONLY DRINKING PEERS) ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR ALCOHOL PROBLEMS AND A HOST OF NEGATIVE PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES (E.G., INCREASED NEGATIVE AFFECT, AGGRESSION). IMPORTANTLY, SEVERAL PROSPECTIVE STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT SOLITARY ALCOHOL USE IS AN INDEPENDENT AND ROBUST EARLY RISK MARKER FOR AUD. DESPITE THE KNOWN RISKS, CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOUNG ADULT SOLITARY ALCOHOL USE REMAINS UNKNOWN. LARGE NATIONAL SAMPLES ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF PREVALENCE AND HISTORICAL CHANGE IN YOUNG ADULT SOLITARY ALCOHOL USE, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN SOLITARY ALCOHOL USE ACROSS YOUNG ADULTHOOD AND RISK/PROTECTIVE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SOLITARY ALCOHOL USE.

ALCOHOL USE IS AMONG THE LIFESTYLE FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION OF AGING-RELATED SARCOPENIA, AS IT PROMOTES SKELETAL MUSCLE MYOPATHY IN ADULTS AT HIGH DOSES, AND AT LOW DOSES MAY IMPROVE MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION. CROSS-SECTIONAL AND PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDIES INDICATE THAT HIGH DOSES OF ALCOHOL ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER INCIDENCE OF SARCOPENIA WHILE LOW TO MODERATE INTAKE IS ASSOCIATED WITH MAINTENANCE OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND GRIP STRENGTH, AS WELL AS DECREASED FRAILTY.

FURTHER, COVID-19-RELATED DISTRESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH DRINKING- RELATED COPING, WHICH IN TURN IS RELATED TO INCREASED FREQUENCY AND QUANTITY OF ALCOHOL USE. WHILE THE FULL IMPACT MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR YEARS, IT IS LIKELY THAT INCREASED PARENT-CHILD TIME WITHIN THE HOME MAY MEAN AN INCREASE IN CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT THAT IS HIDDEN FROM MANDATED REPORTERS WHO ARE AN IMPORTANT FRONT-LINE DEFENSE IN KEEPING CHILDREN SAFE (E.G., TEACHERS, CHILDCARE PROVIDERS). IN OUR INNOVATIVE STUDY, WE ASKED MOTHERS DIRECTLY ABOUT THEIR USE OF AGGRESSIVE AND PUNITIVE PARENTING PRACTICES (WHICH CORRELATE WITH USE OF CHILD ABUSE NEGLECT) THREE TIMES A DAY FOR 14 DAYS MID-MARCH THROUGH APRIL 2020, DURING OHIO\u2019S STAY-AT HOME ORDERS AND AGAIN DURING FEBRUARY 2021, BEFORE VACCINATIONS WERE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND WHEN MOST SCHOOLS WERE IN HYBRID OR FULLY VIRTUAL FORMATS.

WHILE DEVELOPING NOVEL MEDICATIONS TO TREAT AUD REMAINS A HIGH PRIORITY RESEARCH AREA, THERE REMAIN MAJOR OPPORTUNITIES TO FURTHER ELUCIDATE CLINICAL RESPONSE IN COMPLETED MEDICATION TRIALS. TO THAT END, A KEY QUESTION IN RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) IS WHICH PATIENTS RESPOND TO A GIVEN PHARMACOTHERAPY. IDENTIFYING TREATMENT RESPONDERS PROVIDES MAJOR OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE CLINICAL CARE FOR AUD BY PERSONALIZING MEDICATION PRACTICES ON THE BASES OF VARIABLES/PREDICTORS OF GOOD CLINICAL RESPONSE.

A FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS IS THE LOSS OF CONTROL OVER ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION THAT RESULTS IN PROGRESSIVELY ESCALATING LEVELS OF ALCOHOL USE AND FACILITATES THE PROGRESSION TO ALCOHOL-DEPENDENCE. GIVEN THE COMORBIDITY OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE AND DISORDERS OF AFFECT SUCH AS DEPRESSION IS EXTREMELY HIGH, IT HAS BEEN POSITED THAT SELF-MEDICATION OF NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE STATES CONTRIBUTES TO CONTINUED EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE AND RELAPSE. FURTHERMORE, NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE STATES PRODUCED BY CHRONIC ALCOHOL EXPOSURE CAN INFLUENCE THE NEUROCIRCUITRY OF COGNITIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PERPETUATE FURTHER EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE. ONCE THAT DEGREE OF DYSREGULATION IS REACHED, COMPONENTS OF THE DEPENDENCE CYCLE SERVE TO FACILITATE EACH OTHER IN A MANNER THAT IS EXTREMELY DELETERIOUS TO PERSONAL, FAMILIAL AND SOCIETAL WELFARE. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR\u2019S LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC TARGETS AND STRATEGIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD). THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION, WHICH IS THE NEXT STEP IN PURSUIT OF THAT GOAL, IS TO UNDERSTAND THE NEUROADAPTATIONS IN OPRK1 (KAPPA-OPIOID RECEPTOR GENE)-REGULATED SYSTEMS THAT OCCUR IN RESPONSE TO CHRONIC ALCOHOL EXPOSURE AND CONTRIBUTE TO MALADAPTIVE BEHAVIORAL REGULATION. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE OPRK1-REGULATED NEUROCIRCUITRY BECOMES PROGRESSIVELY DYSREGULATED IN A MANNER THAT PROMOTES THE CONTINUED EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL AND PERPETUATES THE CYCLE OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE. THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED STUDIES IS THAT UNDERSTANDING THE CONTRIBUTION OF DYSREGULATED OPRK1 EXPRESSION IN AUD WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE THERAPIES DESIGNED TO ALLEVIATE MALADAPTIVE BEHAVIORAL REGULATION PRODUCED BY ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY UTILIZING INDUCIBLE AND CONDITIONAL CRISPR/CAS9 GENE EDITING AND CHEMOGENETIC APPROACHES TO RECAPITULATE OR AMELIORATE SYMPTOMS OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE IN NON-SELECTED AND TRANSGENIC RATS. ANIMAL MODELS OF OPERANT ALCOHOL SELF-ADMINISTRATION, NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE-LIKE BEHAVIOR AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION INCLUDING WORKING MEMORY WILL SERVE AS FUNCTIONAL END-POINTS TO SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF OPRK1 EXPRESSION IN MALADAPTIVE BEHAVIORAL REGULATION RELATED TO ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE. IN ADDITION, OPRK1 GENE EXPRESSION WILL BE ASSESSED AS A COMPLEMENT TO THE BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL HELP TO IDENTIFY THE FUNCTIONAL IMPORTANCE OF NEUROADAPTATIONS IN OPRK1-REGULATED SYSTEMS THAT RESULT FROM CHRONIC ALCOHOL EXPOSURE AND WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED INFORMATION REGARDING THE INFLUENCE OF OPRK1 ON THE NEUROCIRCUITRY OF AUD-RELATED PHENOTYPES. SUCH A CONTRIBUTION IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT WILL HELP IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP THERAPEUTIC TARGETS TO TREAT AUD THAT FOCUS ON THE REMOVAL OF MALADAPTIVE PHENOTYPES; A STRATEGY THAT SHOULD GREATLY INCREASE TREATMENT COMPLIANCE AND DECREASE RATES OF RELAPSE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ceec5ef7-d6a5-28f0-e23f-ec61155b7078-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01AA031171_7529"}, {"internal_id": 161643761, "Award ID": "R01AA031159", "Award Amount": 681663.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-08-01", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "MINDFULNESS-BASED RELAPSE PREVENTION AS VIDEO CONFERENCING CONTINUING CARE TO PROMOTE LONG TERM RECOVERY FROM ALCOHOL USE DISORDER - PROJECT SUMMARY ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) IS PREVALENT AND COSTLY, AND ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY.

RECENT STUDIES IN POPULATION-BASED AND CLINICAL SAMPLES INDICATE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH BENEFIT FROM DRINKING REDUCTIONS, WITHOUT TOTAL ABSTINENCE. ALIGNED WITH THESE FINDINGS, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM HAS PROPOSED A NEW OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF RECOVERY DEFINED AS: REMISSION FROM AUD, CESSATION OF HEAVY DRINKING, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN FUNCTIONING AND WELL-BEING. EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF RECOVERY TO INCLUDE NON- ABSTINENT OUTCOMES COULD INCREASE TREATMENT SEEKING AMONG THOSE WITH AUD WHO ARE NOT WILLING TO ABSTAIN BUT ARE WILLING TO REDUCE DRINKING, AND REDUCE THE PUBLIC HEALTH BURDEN OF UNTREATED AUD.

SECONDARY AIM 2.1 - EXAMINE INITIAL EVIDENCE OF THE EFFICACY OF THE MBSR-L INTERVENTION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT, RELATIVE TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL CONDITION, PARTICIPANTS IN THE MBSR-L CONDITION WILL REPORT: (A) GREATER REDUCTIONS IN FREQUENCY OF BINGE DRINKING EPISODES AND NUMBER OF DRINKS PER DRINKING OCCASION, AND (B) GREATER IMPACTS ON PUTATIVE MECHANISMS OF CHANGE (E.G., REDUCED STRESS, GREATER SELF-REGULATION, AND ENHANCED WELL-BEING).

AS A RESULT, SEVERAL ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS EXPERIENCED BY EMS PROVIDERS INCLUDING OBESITY, SLEEP DISORDERS, MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES, AND MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED. DESPITE THE EMERGENCE OF KNOWN ADVERSE HEALTH IMPACTS, RESEARCH HAS NOT FOCUSED MUCH ATTENTION TO OTHER WELL-KNOWN HEALTH ISSUES SUCH AS ALCOHOL USE. THIS DEARTH OF INFORMATION IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR RISKY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AMONG EMS PROVIDERS AS A RESULT OF THEIR STRESSFUL PROFESSION. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL KNOWN ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL USE (E.G. OCCUPATIONAL OR ACCIDENTAL INJURIES, PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, SLEEP ISSUES, SUBSTANDARD FITNESS, LIVER DISEASE, AND NEUROLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT). THEREFORE, UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF ALCOHOL IN EMS CULTURE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS. THE ROLE OF EMS PROVIDERS HAS BECOME INVALUABLE, RECENTLY HIGHLIGHTED BY THE PANDEMIC, MAKING UNDERSTANDING ALCOHOL USE A PRIORITY TO NOT ONLY THE QUALITY OF EMERGENCY SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC BUT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EMS PROVIDERS. USING A MULTI-METHOD APPROACH, THIS STUDY WILL USE A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF EMS PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE A FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF ALCOHOL USE WITHIN THE EMS PROVIDER CULTURE.

AS ABSTINENCE FROM OPIOIDS DURING PREGNANCY IS NOT RECOMMENDED, OPIOID MEDICATION REPLACEMENT THERAPY, SUCH AS METHADONE, REPRESENTS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WITH OPIOID USE DISORDER THUS PERPETUATING THE BIRTH OF THESE OPIOID-EXPOSED BABIES. PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT PRENATAL OPIOID EXPOSURE PREDISPOSES FOR FUTURE SUBSTANCE MISUSE. GIVEN ITS WIDESPREAD ACCESSIBILITY, ALCOHOL IS ONE OF THE MOST LIKELY ADDICTIVE SUB- STANCES THAT THESE PRENATAL OPIOID-EXPOSED CHILDREN WILL ENCOUNTER. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL DRINKING, IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW PRENATAL METHADONE EX- POSURE (PME) PREDISPOSES THESE CHILDREN FOR FUTURE PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE AND HOW ALCOHOL INTERACTS WITH PME TO PRODUCE DIFFERENTIAL BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES TO ALCOHOL. TO ELUCIDATE MECHANISMS RELATED TO HOW PME MAY PRO- DUCE ENHANCED ALCOHOL-RELATED BEHAVIORS, WE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A MOUSE MODEL OF PME. OUR MODEL RE- CAPITULATES MANY CLINICAL FEATURES OF PRENATAL OPIOID EXPOSURE, INCLUDING PRODUCING NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL. USING OUR MODEL, WE FIND THAT PME INCREASES ALCOHOL DRINKING ONLY IN MALES, CONSISTENT WITH MANY CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT MALES ARE MORE SEVERELY IMPACTED BY PRENATAL OPIOID EXPOSURE. GIVEN THE ROLE OF THE DORSAL STRIATUM BRAIN REGION IN MODULATING MANY ASPECTS OF ALCOHOL DRINKING, WE BIOCHEMICALLY EXPLORED THE PROTEOME OF THE DORSAL STRIATUM AND FOUND THAT PME HAD A GREATER EFFECT ON PROTEIN AND PROTEIN PHOSPHORY- LATION EXPRESSION IN MALES THAN FEMALES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR DRINKING DATA. PATHWAY ANALYSES OF OUR PROTEOMICS DATA IMPLICATED GLUTAMATE AND LONG-TERM SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION PLASTICITY (LTD) IN THE DORSOLATERAL STRIATUM (DLS) AS BEING DISRUPTED BY PME. WE FURTHER DISCOVERED THAT PME REDUCED DORSAL STRIATAL GLUTAMATE TRANSMISSION AND DISRUPTED LTD. RECENT WORK FROM OUR LABORATORY DEMONSTRATES THAT ALCOHOL INDUCES GLUTAMATERGIC SYNAPTIC PLAS- TICITY AND DISRUPTS LTD AT ANTERIOR INSULAR CORTEX INPUTS TO THE DLS (AICDLS SYNAPSES) IN MICE, BUT ONLY IN MALE MICE AND THIS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED MALE ALCOHOL DRINKING BEHAVIOR. WE REASONED THAT THE MALE-SPECIFIC, PME-INDUCED INCREASE IN BINGE-LIKE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION MAY UTILIZE SIMILAR MECHANISMS AS THE MALE-SPECIFIC, ALCOHOL-INDUCED AICDLS SYNAPTIC CHANGES THAT GOVERN EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT PME PRODUCES SYNAPTIC ADAPTATIONS EXCLUSIVELY IN MALES THAT ENHANCE AICDLS GLUTAMATERGIC TRANSMISSION THAT IN TURN GOVERN THE ELEVATED BINGE-LIKE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION SEEN IN MALE, BUT NOT FEMALE PME MICE.

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY (ACT) IS A PROMISING TRANSDIAGNOSTIC INTERVENTION FOR PWH THAT TARGETS EA. ACT IS AN EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED TREATMENT FOR MULTIPLE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES; HOWEVER THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY FULL-SCALE RCTS OF ACT FOR ALCOHOL USE AMONG ANY POPULATION, INCLUDING PWH.

DESPITE THE PREVALENCE AND COST OF THIS DISORDER, TREATMENT STRATEGIES ARE INEFFECTIVE, ESPECIALLY IN PREVENTING RELAPSE. A KEY FEATURE IN SOME INDIVIDUALS IS THE INDUCTION OF NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE STATES WHEN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IS CEASED. IN THESE INDIVIDUALS, ALCOHOL TAKING AND SEEKING IS HYPOTHESIZED TO BE MOTIVATED BY NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT, WHERE INDIVIDUALS CONTINUE CONSUMING ALCOHOL TO AVOID NEGATIVE INTERNAL STATES THAT ARE TRIGGERED BY ABSTINENCE. WHILE PAST RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON HOW ABSTINENCE PRODUCES NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE STATES, THE QUESTION REMAINS AS TO HOW AFFECTIVE DISTURBANCES MOTIVATE BEHAVIOR (I.E. NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT). TO THIS END, THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL THE MOTIVATION TO AVOID AVERSIVE STIMULI ARE ENGAGED BY ALCOHOL AND ASSOCIATED CUES TO DRIVE ALCOHOL SEEKING. AT THE CENTER OF REINFORCEMENT IS THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS (NAC). THE NAC IS A HETEROGENEOUS REGION PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF TWO NON-OVERLAPPING CELL TYPES: D1 AND D2 MEDIUM SPINY PROJECTION NEURONS (MSNS) WHICH PLAY COMPLEMENTARY ROLES IN CONTROLLING MOTIVATED BEHAVIORS4. WHILE PREVIOUS WORK HAS IMPLICATED D1 MSNS IN POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT, OUR DATA SHOW THAT D2 MSNS RESPOND TO CUES THAT SIGNAL NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT AND CAUSALLY CONTROL THE MOTIVATION TO AVOID AVERSIVE STIMULI. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT D2 MSNS ARE ENGAGED BY ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED CUES FOLLOWING WITHDRAWAL FROM CHRONIC INTERMITTENT ETHANOL EXPOSURE (CIE; ACHIEVED VIA VAPOR INHALATION), AND DRIVE ALCOHOL SEEKING.  TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS, WILL USE A VARIETY OF CUTTING-EDGE OPTICAL APPROACHES TO RECORD FROM AND MANIPULATE THESE CELLS TO DEFINE THE TEMPORAL PATTERNS BY WHICH THEY RESPOND TO ALCOHOL ASSOCIATED CUES AND LINK THIS TO ALCOHOL SEEKING FOLLOWING CIE EXPOSURE. WE WILL DETERMINE HOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF D2 RESPONSES TO ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED CUES IS PREDICTED BY THE NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE STATES THAT DEVELOP OVER WITHDRAWAL FROM CIE. FINALLY, USING PATCH CLAMP ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY WITH CHANNELRHODOPSIN ASSISTED CIRCUIT MAPPING WE WILL 1) DEFINE HOW CIE CHANGES GLUTAMATERGIC DRIVE ONTO D2 MSNS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY ACTIVATED BY NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT (FROM THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX, THALAMUS, AND BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA) AND 2) USE DRUGS ACUTELY RESTRICTED BY TETHERING (DARTS) IN VIVO TO PREVENT GLUTAMATERGIC DRIVE SELECTIVELY THROUGH AMPA RECEPTORS ON NAC CELLS ACTIVATED BY NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT AND PREVENT ALCOHOL SEEKING.

CRUCIALLY, LATINX INDIVIDUALS IN THE US EXPERIENCE GREATER LONELINESS THAN NON-LATINX WHITE INDIVIDUALS, AND THOSE WHO DRINK ENGAGE IN MORE PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE.

WE WILL EVALUATE A NOVEL PROCESS MODEL THAT EXPLAINS LONELINESS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL PROBLEMS IN LATINX INDIVIDUALS. THE ALMA PROCESS MODEL STATES THAT SOCIAL CONTEXTUAL FACTORS INTERACT WITH ACCULTURATIVE PROCESSES TO PREDICT LONELINESS, DRINKING MOTIVES, AND ALCOHOL PROBLEMS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS RESEARCH, GUIDED BY THE ALMA PROCESS MODEL, IS THAT CONFLICTS BETWEEN LATINX INDIVIDUALS' CULTURAL ORIENTATION AND THE CULTURAL ORIENTATION OF THOSE AROUND THEM CONTRIBUTE TO DECREASES IN PERCEIVED SOCIAL CONNECTION, LEADING TO LONELINESS. WHEN FEELING LONELY, SOME PEOPLE INCREASE SOLITARY DRINKING TO COPE WITH LONELINESS. DRINKING TO AVOID AN AVERSIVE STATE WILL LEAD PEOPLE TO FOCUS MORE ON THAT STATE, EXACERBATING PEOPLE'S FEELINGS OF LONELINESS. OVER TIME, MORE SOLITARY DRINKING WILL FEED BACK INTO THE EXPERIENCE OF LONELINESS, LEADING TO ESCALATIONS IN PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE.

ON AVERAGE, THE RISK FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE INCREASES AFTER HIGH SCHOOL AND DECREASES AFTER COLLEGE, THOUGH THERE IS CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY IN THESE TRENDS. WHEN CONSIDERING NOVEL COGNITIVE TARGETS FOR INTERVENTION EFFORTS, EMERGING ADULTHOOD IS ALSO A TIME OF SELF- EXPLORATION AND SELF-CONCEPT AND IDENTITY CHANGES, SUGGESTING THAT IDENTITY-BASED FACTORS MAY BE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT. OUR LABS HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF RESEARCH EVALUATING IDENTITY AND DRINKING. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT DRINKING IDENTITY IS A UNIQUE COGNITIVE PREDICTOR OF ALCOHOL MISUSE AND THAT CHANGES IN DRINKING IDENTITY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN DRINKING IN THE EARLY COLLEGE YEARS AND DURING THE TRANSITION OUT OF COLLEGE. KEY NEXT STEPS INVOLVE THE VALIDATION OF STRATEGIES FOR SHIFTING DRINKING IDENTITY TO PREVENT THE TYPICAL ESCALATION OF ALCOHOL MISUSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND EXPEDITE REDUCTIONS IN ALCOHOL MISUSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION OUT OF COLLEGE. AN EXTENSIVE PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE ON THE SELF- CONCEPT, IDENTITY MOTIVATION, POSSIBLE SELVES, AND SELF-REGULATION PROVIDES A STRONG THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR ADAPTING A FUTURE POSSIBLE SELVES TASK TO SHIFT DRINKING IDENTITY AND, IN TURN, REDUCE ALCOHOL MISUSE. OUR OVERARCHING AIMS ARE TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN DRINKING IDENTITY IN RESPONSE TO THE FUTURE POSSIBLE SELVES TASK, TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THOSE CHANGES ARE, IN TURN, FOLLOWED BY CHANGES IN ALCOHOL MISUSE AND KEY RISK FACTORS, AND TO ESTABLISH BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THESE CHANGES\u2014E.G., THEIR DURABILITY, THE MOST EFFECTIVE TASK VERSION, AND THE NEED FOR MULTIPLE (VS. SINGLE) TASK DOSES. WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT TWO EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES (STUDY 1: HIGH SCHOOL TRANSITION; STUDY 2: COLLEGE TRANSITION) THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AT TWO DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE SITES (N = 528 PER STUDY; N = 264 PER STUDY SITE). WE WILL USE A 2 (IMAGINE AND WRITE ABOUT A FUTURE POSSIBLE DESIRED SELF VS. NOT) X 2 (IMAGINE AND WRITE ABOUT A FUTURE POSSIBLE FEARED SELF VS. NOT) X 2 (1 VS. 3 WRITING SESSION[S]) DESIGN. THE EFFECTS OF THE FUTURE POSSIBLE SELVES TASK ON DRINKING IDENTITY, RISK FACTORS, AND ALCOHOL MISUSE WILL BE EVALUATED OUT TO 12 MONTHS. OUR APPROACH PROVIDES A ROBUST TEST OF THE TASK\u2019S EFFICACY AS AN ALCOHOL MISUSE PREVENTION [STUDY 1] AND INTERVENTION [STUDY 2] STRATEGY.

UNDERSTANDING RISK FACTORS THAT ASSOCIATE WITH AND PREDICT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUDS IN PTSD COULD INFORM INTERVENTIONS AND PREVENTION EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF THIS COMORBIDITY AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES OF BOTH DISORDERS. IDENTIFYING PREDICTORS OF RISK REQUIRES LONGITUDINAL STUDIES IN PTSD AIMED AT CAPTURING THE MECHANISMS LEADING TO THE EMERGENCE OF AUDS. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE PTSD IS RELATED TO BIASED DECISION-MAKING DURING APPROACH-AVOIDANCE CONFLICT. ALCOHOL IS ALSO SUGGESTED TO ALTER APPROACH-AVOIDANCE DECISION-MAKING. AUDS AND ACUTE ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A BIAS TO SEEK OUT REWARD DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY OF THREAT (E.G., CONTRIBUTING TO RELAPSE FOLLOWING ALCOHOL CUE EXPOSURE AND RISKY BEHAVIOR DURING INTOXICATION RESPECTIVELY). ALCOHOL-INDUCED CHANGES IN APPROACH-AVOIDANCE DECISION-MAKING HAVE NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THE CONTEXT OF PTSD, BUT EMERGING DATA SUPPORT OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT AN INTERACTION BETWEEN ALCOHOL AND APPROACH-AVOIDANCE CONFLICT IN PTSD MAY OCCUR AND CONTRIBUTE TO RISK FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL PROBLEMS.

EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT NEUTROPHILS ARE A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO ALD. HOWEVER, BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF MOLECULAR PATHWAYS IMPORTANT IN REGULATING NEUTROPHIL FUNCTIONS IS REQUIRED TO TARGET THESE CELLS FOR ALD TREATMENT. IT IS RECENTLY REVEALED THAT THE ACTIVITY AND EXPRESSION LEVELS OF NADPH OXIDASE (NOX)2, A MAJOR SOURCE OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS), WERE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED IN NEUTROPHILS FROM PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS OR ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS. ALTHOUGH ROS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INFLAMMATION, MOUNTING EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT NOX2-DERIVED ROS ACTUALLY PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN LIMITING, RATHER THAN PROMOTING, INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES.

DESPITE THE RECENT SURGE IN THE USE OF IMMUNOMODULATORY BIOLOGICS FOR OTHER INFLAMMATORY DISEASES, CORTICOSTEROIDS REMAIN THE ONLY THERAPEUTIC FOR HEPATIC INFLAMMATION, UNDERSCORING A MAJOR UNMET CLINICAL NEED. WHILE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT A COMBINATION OF ETHANOL-INDUCED HEPATOCYTE CELL DEATH AND ELEVATED CIRCULATING ENDOTOXIN DRIVES HEPATIC INFLAMMATION IN ALD, A MAJOR QUESTION ARISING IS HOW THE CHRONIC LOW GRADE INFLAMMATION IS INITIATED AND AMPLIFIED IN THE PROGRESSION OF ALD. WE REPORTED THAT LOW-DOSE ENDOTOXIN INDUCES THE EXPRESSION OF MINCLE, A MEMBER OF THE C-TYPE LECTIN RECEPTOR FAMILY THAT ACTS AS A SENSOR FOR CELL DEATH, VIA THE IRAKM-DEPENDENT TLR4 SIGNALING IN HEPATIC MACROPHAGES. MINCLE DETECTS COMPONENTS RELEASED BY DEAD HEPATOCYTES AND ACTIVATES INFLAMMASOMES AND IL-1SS PRODUCTION, SERVING AS A CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN CELL DEATH AND INFLAMMATION IN MURINE MODELS OF ALD. RECENTLY, WE FOUND SERUM CONCENTRATIONS OF SS- GLUCOSYLCERAMIDE (GLUCER), A MINCLE LIGAND RELEASED BY DYING HEPATOCYTES, ARE INCREASED BY ETHANOL FEEDING IN MICE AND HIGHLY ELEVATED IN SERA FROM PATIENTS WITH AH. GLUCER CONCENTRATIONS WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH DISEASE SEVERITY IN PATIENTS, SUGGESTING THAT GLUCER MAY BE A MAJOR MINCLE LIGAND DRIVING HEPATIC INFLAMMATION AND FIBROSIS IN ALD. INTRIGUINGLY, MINCLE ACTIVATION LEADS TO A NON-LYTIC FORM OF IL-1SS SECRETION FROM HEPATIC MACROPHAGES AND HEPATIC STELLATE CELLS (HSCS) VIA A NOVEL GSDMD-MEDIATED BIOGENESIS AND RELEASE OF SMALL EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES (SEVS). THE NON-LYTIC IL-1SS SECRETION SPARES HEPATIC MACROPHAGES FROM PYROPTOSIS, ALLOWING THEM TO CONTINUE AMPLIFYING THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. IMPORTANTLY, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA HIGHLIGHT A CRITICAL PATHOGENIC ROLE FOR IL-1SS CONTAINING SEVS IN POTENTIATING ETHANOL-INDUCED LIVER INJURY IN MICE. MECHANISTICALLY, WE FOUND THAT IL-1SS INDUCED THE EXPRESSION OF SAA IN HEPATOCYTES, WHICH IN TURN ACTIVATED CASPASE3-GSDME-MEDIATED PYROPTOSIS. HEPATOCYTE PYROPTOSIS RELEASES THE DANGER SIGNAL HMGB1, WHICH CAN FURTHER ACTIVATE CASPASE 1 AND 11-DEPENDENT GSDMD-CLEAVAGE IN NEIGHBORING HEPATOCYTES, AMPLIFYING HEPATOCYTE INJURY. THIS ESCALATION OF INJURY NOT ONLY IMPAIRS LIVER FUNCTION BUT LIKELY LEADS TO FURTHER RELEASE OF GLUCER, AMPLIFYING MACROPHAGE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES. IMPORTANTLY, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA REVEAL THAT GLUCER ALSO ACTIVATED HSCS, ENHANCING COLLAGEN DEPOSITION AND AGGRAVATING LIVER FIBROSIS.

THIS METABOLITE IS A HYBRID MOLECULE WITH PART FROM TAF AND PART FROM ETHANOL. TAF IS A NEW VERSION OF TDF (TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE) WITH DECREASED ORGAN TOXICITY, AND BOTH TENOFOVIR PRODRUGS ARE HYDROLYZED AND FOLLOWED BY PHOSPHORYLATION TO PRODUCE THERAPEUTICALLY ACTIVE METABOLITE.

FOR MSM, UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE MAY REDUCE PREP PERSISTENCE AND ADHERENCE, WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR HIV PREVENTION. REDUCING UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE MAY IMPROVE PREP OUTCOMES. THE BRIEF ALCOHOL INTERVENTION (BAI), WHICH DRAWS ON MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY, INCREASES VIRAL SUPPRESSION AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV ON ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY.

HUMAN AND PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ALCOHOL INCREASES VULNERABILITY TO BOTH BACTERIAL AND VIRAL INFECTIONS (SZABO, 2015), THOUGH ADOLESCENT SENSITIVITY TO THE UNTOWARD EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON IMMUNE FUNCTION REMAIN UNCLEAR. IMPORTANTLY, NEUROIMMUNE FUNCTION IS SEVERELY ALTERED BY BINGE-LIKE ALCOHOL EXPOSURE IN RODENT MODELS YET THE ROLE OF CNS-MEDIATED HOST DEFENSE PROCESSES HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. THE EMERGENCE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC DRIVEN BY WIDESPREAD NOVEL CORONAVIRUS SARS-COV-2 AND ITS ASSOCIATED DISEASE STATE, COVID-19, HAS REVEALED UNIQUE VULNERABILITIES FOR CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS. ALTHOUGH THE GREATEST VULNERABILITY TO ADVERSE OUTCOMES OF COVID-19 IS AGE, INCREASING DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT MALE PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 EXHIBIT ENHANCED DISEASE SEVERITY, HIGHER COMPLICATION RATES, AND HIGHER MORTALITY HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS GREAT MYSTERY REGARDING DIFFERENCES IN VIRAL INFECTION SEVERITY, AND THE RESPONSE TO VACCINE, ACROSS INDIVIDUALS. WE PROPOSE THAT A HISTORY OF ALCOHOL MISUSE DURING ADOLESCENCE MAY SET THE STAGE FOR ADVERSE REACTIONS TO VIRAL INFECTION AND VACCINATIONS.

SIMILAR SIGNS OF SUPPRESSED CYTOKINE INDUCTION WERE SUBSEQUENTLY OBSERVED IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS IN RESPONSE TO MILD TISSUE INJURY, WITH OTHER STUDIES REPORTING IMPAIRED FEVER RESPONSES WHEN ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL-EXPOSED RATS WERE CHALLENGED A WEEK LATER WITH LPS, A TLR4-DEPENDENT INFLAMMOGEN. ALTHOUGH THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT AIE MAY PRODUCE A GLOBAL IMPAIRMENT IN INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES, RECENT WORK FROM OUR LAB SUGGESTS THAT THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL MAY BE PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC.

WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ALCOHOL SUPPRESSES BOTH THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL EXPRESSION AND LIGAND-MEDIATED ACTIVATION OF FXR IN THE INTESTINE THROUGH UPREGULATING MIR194 AND DISTURBING GUT-MICROBIOME-BA TRANSFORMATION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH LEAD TO THE INCREASES IN HEPATIC DE NOVO BA SYNTHESIS, LIPOGENESIS AND ALD AND THAT LDNP SUPPLEMENTATION CAN DIMINISH ALCOHOL-INDUCED INCREASES IN BA SYNTHESIS AND LIPOGENESIS AND ATTENUATE ALD THROUGH SUPPRESSING INTESTINAL MIR194 EXPRESSION AND REGULATING GUT MICROBIOME BA TRANSFORMATION. THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BE PURSUED TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS: AIM 1. DETERMINE THE ROLE OF INTESTINAL MIR194 IN THE ALCOHOL-INDUCED DYSREGULATION OF LIVER BA SYNTHESIS AND LIPOGENESIS. AIM 2. DETERMINE THE ROLE OF LDNPS IN THE REGULATION OF INTESTINAL MIR194-FXR-FGF15 SIGNALING IN ALD. AIM 3. DETERMINE WHETHER LDNP TREATMENT ALTERS GUT MICROBIOTA AND BA PROFILE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO FXR ACTIVATION IN ALD. AIM 4. EVALUATE THE INTESTINAL MIR194 AND FXR ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH AH. IN SUMMARY, THE PROPOSED STUDY REPRESENTS THE FIRST MOLECULAR STUDY ON HOW INTESTINAL MIRNA REGULATES LIVER BA HOMEOSTASIS AND HOW A PROBIOTIC PRODUCT TARGETS INTESTINAL MIRNA194-FXR-FGF15 SINGLING IN ALD.

DIRECT PROJECTIONS FROM CEREBELLAR DEEP NUCLEI (DN) TO THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA (VTA) HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, AND STIMULATION OF THESE CEREBELLAR AFFERENTS TO THE VTA WAS FOUND TO BE REWARDING. SUCH FINDINGS RAISE THE POSSIBILITY THAT CEREBELLAR DYSFUNCTION COULD CONTRIBUTE SUBSTANTIALLY TO ADDICTION VIA A CEREBELLAR INFLUENCE OVER VTA. CONSISTENT WITH ANIMAL FINDINGS, WE HAVE FOUND IN HUMAN FMRI PRELIMINARY DATA STRONG CEREBELLAR AND VTA ACTIVATION IN RESPONSE TO ALCOHOL CUES RELATIVE TO NON- ALCOHOL STIMULI IN PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) COMPARED TO CONTROLS, AND CLOSE COUPLING OBSERVED BETWEEN DN AND VTA ACTIVATION. STUDYING AUD AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS, THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THREE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. THE FIRST IS: WHAT IS THE NATURE OF CEREBELLAR INPUT TO THE VTA, AND HOW IS IT PERTURBED IN AUD? A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WHEN A STIMULUS IS PRESENTED, THE CEREBELLUM GENERATES A PREDICTION OF EVENTS THAT WILL FOLLOW BASED ON PRIOR ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING, AND THEN COMPARES PREDICTED AND ACTUAL OUTCOMES TO GENERATE A PREDICTION ERROR. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THESE FUNCTIONS ARE DISRUPTED IN AUD. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT WHEN AN EXPECTED STIMULUS DOES NOT OCCUR, A STRONG PREDICTION ERROR SIGNAL IN THE FORM OF INCREASED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY (FC) BETWEEN CEREBELLUM AND ITS PROJECTION TARGET IS OBSERVED, AND WE FOUND AN ANALOGOUS INCREASE IN DN-VTA FC, THAT WAS ABNORMAL IN AUD PATIENTS, WHEN ALCOHOL PICTURES WERE PRESENTED. IN AIM 1, USING FMRI AND A MONETARY INCENTIVE TASK, WE WILL INVESTIGATE IF DN-VTA FC REFLECTS REWARD PREDICTION AND/OR POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE REWARD PREDICTION ERROR. THE SECOND QUESTION IS: IS THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVATION IN BRAIN REWARD CENTERS THAT IS ELICITED BY ALCOHOL STIMULI RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF DYSFUNCTION IN THE CEREBELLUM? IN AIM 2 WE WILL INVESTIGATE 2 MEASURES OF CEREBELLAR INTEGRITY TO DETERMINE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF ALCOHOL CUE RELATED ACTIVATION IN CEREBELLAR, VTA, AND OTHER REWARD STRUCTURES, AND WITH DN- VTA FC: (1) THE TIMING OF THE UNDERSHOOT OF THE CEREBELLAR HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSE FUNCTION (HRF), WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE CORRELATED WITH NUMBER OF LIFETIME DRINKS; AND (2) CLASSICAL EYEBLINK CONDITIONING, FOR WHICH THE CEREBELLUM IS NECESSARY. THE THIRD QUESTION IS: CAN ABNORMAL CEREBELLAR ACTIVATION AND FC, AS WELL AS ALCOHOL CRAVING, BE REDUCED BY NON-INVASIVE CEREBELLAR STIMULATION? IN AIM 3, USING FMRI COMBINED WITH CEREBELLAR TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (TDCS) DURING A CUE REACTIVITY TASK, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT IN AUD PARTICIPANTS CEREBELLAR AND VTA ACTIVATION WILL BE REDUCED, DN-VTA FC WILL BE NORMALIZED, AND ALCOHOL CRAVING WILL BE REDUCED. WE WILL EXAMINE, USING BOTH RESTING STATE FMRI AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INTERACTION ANALYSIS, THE EFFECTS OF TDCS ON FC AMONG IMPORTANT STRUCTURES OF THE REWARD SYSTEM AS WELL AS ON DN-VTA FC.

FKBP5 IS AN IMPORTANT PROTEIN INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OF MANY KEY CELLULAR SIGNALING CASCADES. WE OBSERVED A TWO-FOLD UPREGULATION OF FKBP5 MRNA EXPRESSION IN THE LIVER OF PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS COMPARED TO HEALTHY CONTROLS. THE INCREASE IN FKBP5 EXPRESSION AT THE TRANSCRIPT AND PROTEIN LEVEL WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN ETHANOL-FED MICE. INTERESTINGLY, LOSS OF FKBP5 PROTECTED AGAINST ALCOHOL-INDUCED LIVER INJURY.

TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE WILL FIRST DETERMINE HOW ALCOHOL INDUCES FKBP5 EXPRESSION. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGESTED THAT PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS HAD SIGNIFICANT DOWNREGULATION IN FKBP5 METHYLATION LEVELS AT ITS PROMOTER REGION. IN THE FIRST SPECIFIC AIM, WE WILL CAREFULLY DISSECT THE UPSTREAM PATHWAY OF HOW ETHANOL INDUCES FKBP5 EXPRESSION BY TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT REDUCED METHYLATION LEVELS OF FKBP5 AT THE CPG ISLAND LOCATED AT ITS 5\u2019 UTR PROMOTER REGION BY ETHANOL LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN ITS TRANSCRIPT AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION.

OUR APPROACH IS GUIDED BY A CONCEPTUAL MODEL THAT INCORPORATES INTERSECTIONALITY THEORY AND THE ANDERSEN\u2019S MODEL OF HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION. WE FIRST IDENTIFY TRENDS AND PREDICTORS OF UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE (DEFINED AS EXCEEDING GUIDELINES OR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER) AMONG AGING WOMEN OVERALL AND BY AGE AND RACE/ETHNICITY.

RELAPSE IS DRIVEN IN PART BY ALCOHOL-INDUCED SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY AT THE CORTICOSTRIATAL CIRCUIT. THE DORSOMEDIAL STRIATUM (DMS) HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN ALCOHOL SEEKING AND RELAPSE. THE DMS CONTAINS DIRECT-PATHWAY MEDIUM SPINY NEURONS (DMSNS) AND INDIRECT-PATHWAY MSNS (IMSNS), WHICH POSITIVELY AND NEGATIVELY REGULATE ALCOHOL SEEKING, RESPECTIVELY. ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED BEHAVIORS SUCH AS OPERANT SELF-ADMINISTRATION ACTIVATE ONLY A RELATIVELY SMALL SUBSET OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES IN THE STRIATUM. ALTHOUGH ALCOHOL-INDUCED PLASTICITY IS MUCH STUDIED IN BULK TISSUE, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER IT IS INDUCED IN DMSN ENSEMBLES. CHARACTERIZING SYNAPTIC MECHANISMS OF THE ENSEMBLE NEURONS IS ESPECIALLY VITAL TO RECONCILE WITH THE DECADES OF EVIDENCE FOR DRUG-INDUCED SYNAPTIC CHANGES DETECTED IN BULK TISSUE ANALYSIS. IN ADDITION, EXTINCTION TRAINING YIELDS GREATER SUPPRESSION OF ALCOHOL SEEKING RELATIVE TO ABSTINENCE ALONE, BUT THE MECHANISM IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE ABSENCE OF ALCOHOL DELIVERY DURING EXTINCTION LIKELY STIMULATES THALAMIC INPUTS TO THE DMS AND REDUCES STRIATAL DOPAMINE LEVELS, CONCURRENTLY INDUCING THALAMOSTRIATAL LONG-TERM POTENTIATION (LTP) IN DMS IMSNS; THIS ENHANCES \u201cNOGO\u201d ACTIONS, SUPPRESSING ALCOHOL SEEKING DURING RELAPSE. LTP IN IMSNS IS ALSO LIKELY TO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY SUPPRESS DMSN ACTIVITY BY REDUCING DOPAMINERGIC ACTIVITY.

EMERGING EVIDENCE NOW SUGGESTS THAT BILE ACID ABNORMALITIES PLAY A CAUSATIVE ROLE IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF ALD.

THUS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO OVERCOME THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP BY DETERMINING THE LINK BETWEEN PEROXISOMAL DYSFUNCTION, THE CONSEQUENT BILE ACID DISORDER, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALD. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT ALCOHOL EXPOSURE DECREASES HEPATIC PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS IN A MANNER DEPENDENT ON A KEY PEROXIN, PEX3, IN BOTH ALCOHOL-FED MICE AND PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS. USING A UNIQUE MOUSE MODEL OF HEPATOCYTE-SPECIFIC PEROXISOME DEFICIENCY (PEX3 KNOCKOUT), WE FOUND THAT PEROXISOMES ARE CRITICAL FOR BILE ACID SYNTHESIS AND THAT PEX3 REDUCTION CAUSES SYSTEMIC ACCUMULATION OF TOXIC BILE ACID INTERMEDIATES AND INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ALCOHOL. BY PURSUING THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH PEROXISOMAL DYSFUNCTION CAUSES LIVER DAMAGE, WE FOUND THAT PEROXISOME AFFECTS MITOCHONDRIAL AND ER DYNAMICS, AT LEAST PARTIALLY, THROUGH BILE ACID INTERMEDIATES. MOREOVER, WE FOUND A STRONG INDUCTION OF LIPOCALIN 2 IN ALD PATIENTS AND MICE AS WELL AS IN PEX3 KNOCKOUT MICE.

WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO PERFORM COMPREHENSIVE GENETIC ANALYSES, INCLUDING GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWASS), TO IDENTIFY GENETIC MARKERS OF AWS RISK AND RESPONSE TO BENZODIAZEPINE TREATMENT OF AWS. THE PROPOSED ANALYSES WILL CONSTITUTE THE LARGEST GWAS OF AWS TO DATE, WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF AUD SUBJECTS 10 TIMES LARGER THAN THE ONLY PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED AWS GWAS, AND THE FIRST GWAS OF BENZODIAZEPINE RESPONSE. WE WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE SEX DIFFERENCES IN GENETIC EFFECTS ON AWS AND RESPONSE TO ITS TREATMENT. OUR STUDY WILL INVOLVE ADVANCED ANALYSES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENT OF SNP-BASED HERITABILITY OF AWS ALONG WITH GENE AND PATHWAY-LEVEL ANALYSES (INCLUDING DRUG-TARGET ENRICHMENT) AND FINE-MAPPING TO DETECT RELEVANT GENETIC EFFECTS. WE WILL ALSO USE POLYGENIC RISK SCORES TO DETERMINE IF GENETIC LOAD FOR AUD-RELATED TRAITS IS ASSOCIATED WITH AWS.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ALSO SUPPORTS NIH EFFORTS TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND ATTENTION TO SEX AND GENDER IN RESEARCH. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA AND POWER CALCULATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE DATA IS EXPECTED TO IDENTIFY COMMON GENETIC VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH AWS. DISCOVERY OF GENETIC VARIANTS THAT IMPACT THE RISK OF AWS WILL GENERATE KNOWLEDGE ON ITS NEUROBIOLOGY AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS AT RISK AND SELECTION OF TREATMENT OPTIONS BASED ON AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTER- INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SENSITIVITY TO THIS CENTRAL COMPONENT OF AUD.

EMERGENCY SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY CLOSURES CONFINED CHILDREN AND ADULTS TOGETHER IN THEIR HOMES WITH GREATLY LIMITED ACCESS TO OTHER SUPPORTIVE ADULTS AND INSTITUTIONS. ADOLESCENTS' INVOLVEMENT IN DEVELOPMENTALLY-NORMATIVE CONTEXTS WAS INTERRUPTED. THIS CRISIS EVOLVED INTO A CHRONIC, RELAPSING AND REMITTING STATE OF LIFE WITH INTENSITIES THAT VARIED DRAMATICALLY BETWEEN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS ACROSS WEEKS, MONTHS, AND NOW YEARS.

THEREFORE, THE UNMET NEED TO IDENTIFY NOVEL TARGETS FOR DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTICS AGAINST ALD IS URGENT. ALCOHOL NOT ONLY ALTERS HEPATIC LIPID AND BILE ACID METABOLISM BUT ALSO DISRUPTS THE GUT MICROBIOME AND INTESTINAL BARRIER FUNCTION, WHICH RESULTS IN A LEAKY GUT AND BACTERIAL TRANSLOCATION AS WELL AS ACTIVATION OF SYSTEMIC AND HEPATIC INFLAMMATION. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT CONJUGATED BILE ACIDS ACTIVATE SPHINGOSINE- 1 PHOSPHATE RECEPTOR 2 (S1PR2), WHICH FURTHER ACTIVATES ERK1/2 AND AKT. S1P IS ONE OF THE MOST STUDIED SPHINGOLIPIDS AND IS SYNTHESIZED FROM SPHINGOSINE BY EITHER SPHINGOSINE KINASE 1 (SPHK1) OR SPHK2. S1P CAN REGULATE VARIOUS FUNDAMENTAL CELLULAR RESPONSES EITHER AS AN INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING MOLECULE OR A LIGAND FOR FIVE GPCRS, S1PR1-5. SPHK2-GENERATED NUCLEAR S1P IS A POTENT NATURAL INHIBITOR OF HISTONE DEACETYLASES (HDAC1/2). ACTIVATION OF THE STIMULATOR OF INTERFERON GENES (STING) ALSO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL SIGNALING IN ALD. A RECENT STUDY REPORTED THAT SPHK2-MEDIATED PRODUCTION OF NUCLEAR S1P IN CD11B+ MACROPHAGES IS A STRONG INHIBITOR OF STING AND SUPPRESSES THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IN ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGES. WE HAVE REPORTED THAT SPHK2-/- MICE DEVELOPED MORE SEVERE FATTY LIVER AND HEPATIC INJURY IN THE NIAAA ALD MOUSE MODEL. HEPATIC SPHK2 EXPRESSION LEVELS WERE MARKEDLY REDUCED IN BOTH ALD CIRRHOTIC PATIENTS AND ALD MOUSE MODELS. ALCOHOL-FEEDING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY AND BACTERIAL TRANSLOCATION IN SPHK2-/- MICE. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA FURTHER SHOWED THAT 1) ALCOHOL-FEEDING INDUCED MORE SEVERE LIVER INJURY IN THE GLOBAL SPHK2-/- MICE THAN HEPATOCYTE-SPECIFIC SPHK2 KNOCKOUT (SPHK2HEP-/-); 2) INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL CELL-SPECIFIC SPHK2 KNOCKOUT (SPHK2IEC-/-) MICE WERE MORE PRONE TO ALCOHOL-INDUCED LIVER INJURY COMPARED TO SPHK2FL/FL MICE; 3) RNASEQ ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT CHRONIC ALCOHOL FEEDING SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED HEPATIC SPHINGOLIPID, FATTY ACID, AND BILE ACID METABOLISM AND ACTIVATED INFLAMMATORY AND FIBROTIC RESPONSES; 4) DELETION OF SPHK2 INHIBITED THE GROWTH OF INTESTINAL ORGANOIDS.

THE LR SUBSET COMPRISES INDIVIDUALS WHOSE EXPECTED RESPONSE EXCEEDS A PRE-SPECIFIED CLINICALLY DEFINED MINIMUM. IDENTIFYING LR ACHIEVES AN IMPORTANT GOAL OF PRECISION MEDICINE. THE CAUSAL EFFECT OF T COMPARED TO P AMONG LRS IS APPRAISED BASED ON THE OBSERVED OUTCOMES WITHIN STRATA OF SAMPLES MATCHED ON THEIR PROGNOSTIC SCORE. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT, ESPECIALLY FOR SUBSETS OF A RANDOM SAMPLE, MISSPECIFICATION OF THE MODEL CAN LEAD TO SPURIOUS CONCLUSIONS. TO PROTECT AGAINST THIS POSSIBILITY IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE PROGNOSTIC SCORE, WE HAVE ADAPTED AN APPROACH, NOVEL TO RCTS, THAT WE CALL THE RCT DRY RUN (DRRCT) DIAGNOSTIC.

PRIOR IMAGING STUDIES HAVE LARGELY FOCUSED ON CORTICAL REGIONS. THE RELEVANCE OF SUBCORTICAL REGIONS IMPLICATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF ADDICTION AND ANXIETY REMAINS UNCLEAR.

MOREOVER, WHILE GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWASS) OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE (PAU; I.E., A PHENOTYPE THAT COMBINES AUD DIAGNOSES AND A MEASURE OF HARMFUL DRINKING) HAVE YIELDED MANY SIGNIFICANT SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS (SNPS) THAT AFFECT RISK, THESE HAVE YIELDED FEW DRUG TARGETS FOR TREATING AUD. HENCE, THERE IS AN UNMET NEED TO IDENTIFY DRUG TARGETS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL AND/OR REPURPOSED DRUGS TO TREAT AUD. RECENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT TARGETING DISEASE MECHANISMS WITH GENETIC SUPPORT CAN INCREASE THE SUCCESS RATE IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND THAT MODULES (I.E., BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS SURROUNDING DISEASE-ASSOCIATED GENES) ARE ENRICHED FOR TARGETS OF APPROVED DRUGS. THUS, GENES AFFECTING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND RISK OF PAU AND THEIR ASSOCIATED MODULES COULD YIELD NEW TARGETS AND DRUGS FOR THERAPEUTIC REPURPOSING.

PREVIOUS WORK IN AUDS SUGGEST THAT SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES TO ALCOHOL AND STRESS-RELATED MECHANISMS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUDS. IN BIPOLAR DISORDER, ALTERED DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY OF CRITICAL VENTRAL PREFRONTAL NETWORKS THAT MODULATE MOOD AND REWARD PROCESSING MAY ALTER RESPONSES TO ALCOHOL AND STRESSORS; CONSEQUENTLY, THE DISRUPTION IN TYPICAL NEURODEVELOPMENT MAY BE AN UNDERLYING FACTOR FOR THE HIGH RATES OF COMORBIDITY.

DESPITE THESE PROMISING FINDINGS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF TRAUMA ON ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND RISK FOR AUD AND PTSD, AND NO OTHER STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THESE FACTORS TOGETHER IN A LONGITUDINAL PARADIGM, LEAVING THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS AMONG CHILDHOOD TRAUMA, POLYGENIC, AND NEURODEVELOPMENTAL RISK FOR AUD AND PTSD POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE PRESENT STUDY WILL FILL THESE GAPS IN THE LITERATURE IN A HIGHLY TRANSLATIONAL SET OF AIMS. BUILDING OF THE RESEARCH TEAM\u2019S PRIOR WORK, THIS STUDY WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA ON LONGITUDINAL TRAJECTORIES OF BRAIN FUNCTIONING (I.E., EEG FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY) AND RISK FOR ADULT AUD AND PTSD USING DATA FROM THE COLLABORATIVE STUDY ON THE GENETICS OF ALCOHOLISM\u2019S PROSPECTIVE STUDY. NEXT, USING SUMMARY STATISTICS FROM THE LARGEST GENOME WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWAS) ON AUD, AUD-RELATED PHENOTYPES (E.G., ALCOHOL USE BEHAVIORS) AND PTSD, WE WILL ELUCIDATE THE GENETIC FACTOR STRUCTURE OF THESE PHENOTYPES. A NOVEL MULTIVARIATE GENETIC METHOD, GENOMIC STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (GSEM), WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE THE FACTOR STRUCTURE, AND THE RESULTING BEST-FIT MODEL WILL BE USED TO PRODUCE POLYGENIC RISK SCORES (PRS) THAT INDEX SHARED GENETIC RISK BETWEEN THE PHENOTYPES (E.G., AUD-PTSD), AS WELL AS UNIQUE RISK FOR EACH CONDITION. FINALLY, THESE PRS INDEXING RISK UNIQUE AND COMMON FOR AUD-PTSD WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE LONGITUDINAL ANALYSES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA, EEG FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY, AND RISK FOR ADULT AUD AND PTSD.

THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX (ECM) AND ECM DYSHOMEOSTASIS ARE KNOWN TO BE IMPORTANT IN ALD. ECM IS PRODUCED BY RESIDENT CELLS IN THE TISSUE/ORGAN AND CONTAINS A DIVERSE RANGE OF COMPONENTS THAT CREATE A DYNAMIC AND RESPONSIVE MICROENVIRONMENT THAT REGULATES CELL AND TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS. OUR PREVIOUS WORK DEMONSTRATED DIVERSE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ALTERATIONS TO HEPATIC ECM DURING EXPERIMENTAL ALD. IN TOTO, ALTERATIONS TO THE HEPATIC ECM ARE MEDIATED NOT ONLY BY CHANGES IN ECM PRODUCTION, BUT ALSO BY CHANGES IN ECM DEGRADATION. WE AND OTHERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT EVEN ACUTE LIVER INJURY CAUSES ROBUST HEPATIC ECM CHANGES. ECM ALSO REPRESENTS A POTENT RESERVOIR OF CELL-SIGNALING MOLECULES THAT REGULATE CELL BEHAVIOR, DETERMINE CELL PHENOTYPE AND CELL SECRETOME, AS WELL AS INFLUENCE INFLAMMATORY TISSUE RESPONSES. NUMEROUS EXAMPLES EXIST OF CELLS DRAMATICALLY CHANGING THEIR STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL PHENOTYPE WHEN EXPOSED TO ECM DIFFERENT FROM THEIR EXISTING (NORMAL OR ABNORMAL) ECM. BY EXTENSION, CHANGES TO AND/OR ALTERED TURNOVER OF HEPATIC ECM HAVE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE PHENOTYPIC CHANGES IN DISEASE PATHOGENESIS AND PROGRESSION. WORK FROM OUR GROUP SHOWS THAT A MAJOR SOURCE OF SIGNALING MOLECULES IN ECM RESIDES WITHIN MATRIX BOUND NANOVESICLES (MBV). MBV ARE NANOMETER-SIZED, MEMBRANOUS VESICLES UNIQUELY-BOUND WITHIN THE ECM NETWORK. MBV CONTAIN AND PROTECT BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE SIGNALING MOLECULES (MIRNAS/PROTEINS), AND ARE KNOWN TO PLAY A ROLE IN IMMUNOMODULATION, STEM/PROGENITOR CELL DIFFERENTIATION, AND MAINTENANCE OF STRUCTURALLY NORMAL AND FUNCTIONAL TISSUES. MBV LIKELY PLAY A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN TISSUE AND ORGAN ORGANIZATION ACROSS SPECIES AND A REGULATORY ROLE IN THE TISSUE RESPONSE TO INJURY.

SMA OF COLOR ALSO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF AOD USE AND MISUSE THAN HETEROSEXUAL PEERS OF THE SAME RACE/ETHNICITY AND TO SOME EXTENT THEIR WHITE SMA PEERS. DAILY STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION-RELATED STRESSORS SPECIFIC TO THEIR MARGINALIZED IDENTITIES (I.E., MINORITY STRESSORS, RACISM-BASED STRESSORS) CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG SMA OF COLOR. THESE STRESSORS OCCUR AT THE INTERPERSONAL LEVEL (E.G., DISCRIMINATION) AND ARE REINFORCED AT THE STRUCTURAL LEVEL (E.G., ANTI-GAY LAWS, OR RACIST INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES). MINORITY STRESS AT A SINGLE AXIS OF IDENTITY IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED WITH AOD USE AND MISUSE AMONG SEXUAL AND RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS.

AKAP12 (A-KINASE ANCHORING PROTEIN 12) IS A SCAFFOLDING PROTEIN IN SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION BY ANCHORING PROTEIN KINASES (PKA, PKC), CYCLIN-D1 AND HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 47. OUR RECENT PROTEOMICS STUDIES SHOWED THAT AKAP12 EXHIBITED DECREASED INTERACTION WITH KINASES AND INCREASED INTERACTION WITH PHOSPHATASES BY ALCOHOL IN MOUSE MODELS AND HUMAN ALD. THIS LED US TO EXAMINE WHETHER ALCOHOL REGULATED AKAP12 PHOSPHORYLATION. BY PHOSPHO-PEPTIDE MAPPING WE DETERMINED THAT ALCOHOL STRONGLY INHIBITED AKAP12 PHOSPHORYLATION IN MOUSE LIVER. AKAP12\u2019S ALCOHOL-SENSITIVE PHOSPHO- SITES WERE MAINLY PKA-PREDICTED SUBSTRATES. MUTATING THESE PHOSPHO-SITES REDUCED THE STABILITY OF AKAP12 PROTEIN, SUGGESTING THAT PHOSPHORYLATION STABILIZED AKAP12. THE AKAP12 INTERACTOME REVEALED ITS INTERACTIONS WITH PROTEINS KNOWN TO REGULATE LIPID HOMEOSTASIS SUCH AS PKA, 2-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR (2-AR) AND LIPOLYTIC ENZYMES, ADIPOSE-TRIGLYCERIDE LIPASE (ATGL). WE THEREFORE ASSESSED THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF THIS AKAP12 INTERACTOME IN HEPATOCYTES. IT WAS SHOWN PREVIOUSLY THAT AKAP12-MEDIATED PKA SCAFFOLDING RECRUITS IT TO 2- AR. THE SIGNALOSOME OF AKAP12, PKA AND 2-AR REGULATES CAMP LEVELS THROUGH THE PROCESS OF 2-AR DE- SENSITIZATION/RE-SENSITIZATION AND MAY INVOLVE AKAP12 PHOSPHORYLATION. 2-AR/PKA/CAMP SIGNALING LIMITS LIPID ACCUMULATION AND ENHANCES LIPOLYSIS. OUR NOVEL PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATES THAT ALCOHOL EXPOSURE DYSREGULATES SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF THE AKAP12/PKA/2-AR SIGNALOSOME. ALCOHOL INHIBITED THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PKA AND 2-AR. AKAP12 WAS HIGHLY PHOSPHORYLATED AT A S696-S698 PKA-PHOSPHO-SITE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED TO FACILITATE AKAP12-2-AR BINDING. THIS SITE EXHIBITED DECREASED PHOSPHORYLATION UPON ALCOHOL EXPOSURE AND MUTATING THIS AKAP12 SITE REDUCED ITS SCAFFOLDING TOWARDS BOTH PKA AND 2-AR. THIS AKAP12 MUTATION ALSO REDUCED 2-AR PROTEIN STABILITY. ALCOHOL INTERFERED WITH AKAP12-2-AR INTERACTION AND FACILITATED AKAP12 AND 2-AR LYSOSOMAL DEGRADATION. BASED ON THESE DATA, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DECREASED AKAP12 PHOSPHORYLATION FOLLOWING ALCOHOL EXPOSURE MIGHT INTERFERE WITH AKAP12/PKA/2-AR SIGNALOSOME, CAUSING ALTERATIONS IN CAMP SIGNALING, WHICH IN TURN COULD DYSREGULATE LIPID HOMEOSTASIS. PRELIMINARY DATA THAT SUPPORT THIS HYPOTHESIS ARE: 1) ENHANCING ENDOGENOUS AKAP12 LEVELS REVERSES THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON PKA-2-AR INTERACTION; 2) AKAP12 INDUCTION INHIBITS ALCOHOL-MEDIATED INCREASE OF TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS; 3) AKAP12 INDUCTION REVERSES ALCOHOL\u2019S SUPPRESSIVE EFFECT ON FATTY ACID OXIDATION. INDUCTION OF AKAP12 ALSO REVERSES ALCOHOL\u2019S SUPPRESSIVE EFFECT ON THE ACTIVITY OF LIPOLYTIC ENZYME, ATGL. WHETHER THE AKAP12/PKA/2-AR SCAFFOLD CONTROLS LIPID HOMEOSTASIS IS UNKNOWN.

THE FIRST LAYER IS THE WELL-ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF SYNCHRONIZATION THAT IS IDENTIFIED USING CORRELATION METHODS, CALLED THE COOPERATIVE FUNCTIONAL NETWORK (CFN). THE SECOND LAYER IS A PROPOSED NETWORK THAT RESISTS SYNCHRONIZATION AND IS CALLED THE IMPERVIOUS FUNCTIONAL NETWORK (IFN). THE IFN IS ESSENTIAL FOR SHIFTING SYNCHRONIZATION WITHIN AND BETWEEN SUBNETWORKS TO SUPPORT SHIFTS IN COGNITIVE DEMANDS. THE TWO LAYERS COEXIST IN TENSION, EACH PLAYING THEIR OWN ROLE TO SUPPORT STABLE, YET FLEXIBLE, BRAIN FUNCTION. THIS PROJECT COMBINES MATHEMATICAL MODELING AND SIMULATION WITH APPLICATION OF THE METHODS TO PREDICT ALCOHOL DRINKING BEHAVIOR IN NATIONAL CONSORTIUM ON ALCOHOL AND NEURODEVELOPMENT IN ADOLESCENCE (NCANDA) DATA SET. SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT BOTH CFN AND IFN ARE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF NORMAL AND ABNORMAL BRAIN FUNCTION. THERE IS A DESPERATE NEED FOR A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF ALCOHOL USE/MISUSE AND FOR BETTER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF AUD. UNFORTUNATELY, POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS AND TREATMENT TRIALS TARGETING THESE CONDITIONS HAVE CONTINUALLY FAILED. THIS PROJECT COULD HAVE TRANSFORMATIVE POTENTIAL AS IT BRINGS FORTH A PREVIOUSLY UNDISCOVERED ORGANIZATIONAL PRINCIPLE OF THE BRAIN, AND COULD LEAD TO NEW DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES DESIGNS BASED ON THE COMBINED KNOWLEDGE OF THE CFN AND IFN.

A KEY FEATURE OF ALCOHOL ADDICTION IS ALCOHOL DRINKING DESPITE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OR AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER REWARDS. THESE CLINICALLY-SIGNIFICANT \u201cCOMPULSIVE\u201d BEHAVIORS OCCUR IN A MINORITY OF INDIVIDUALS THAT CONSUME ALCOHOL \u2013 A STRONG INDICATION THAT INDIVIDUAL VULNERABILITIES ARE AT THE CORE OF DISEASE. OUR PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT BEHAVIORAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL ADDICTION MANIFEST IN RESPONSE TO PERSISTENT EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING OF TRANSCRIPTION NETWORKS IN SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS AND NEURONAL POPULATIONS. EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS INTEGRATE GENETIC RISK AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS STRESS AND ALCOHOL ITSELF. THEREFORE, ELUCIDATING THE EPIGENETIC NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADDICTIVE STATE IS A MAJOR GOAL OF THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY, BUT UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THESE NETWORKS AND THE DOWNSTREAM IMPACT ON NEUROCIRCUITS INVOLVED IN ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE REMAINS LIMITED. IN PRELIMINARY STUDIES, WE INVESTIGATED A VULNERABLE MINORITY OF LABORATORY ANIMALS THAT SELF-ADMINISTER ALCOHOL DESPITE PAIRING WITH PUNISHMENT (FOOT- SHOCK) \u2013 A COMPULSION-LIKE ALCOHOL SELF-ADMINISTRATION BEHAVIOR. USING A COMBINATION OF TECHNIQUES TO PROFILE GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS IN THE AMYGDALA OF COMPULSIVE RATS, WE IDENTIFIED A CRITICAL ROLE FOR ENHANCER OF ZESTE 2 (EZH2), THE HISTONE 3 LYSINE 27 (H3K27) METHYLTRANSFERASE AND CATALYTIC COMPONENT OF THE POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2). SUBSEQUENTLY, WE FOUND THAT PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITION OF EZH2 ATTENUATES COMPULSIVITY IN RATS. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF EZH2 AND H3K27 METHYLATION IN REGULATING TRANSCRIPTION PROGRAMS IN THE AMYGDALA, A BRAIN REGION LINKED TO ADDICTION THAT IS CRITICAL FOR INTEGRATING RESPONSE TO ADVERSE STIMULI. USING A RELATIVELY NOVEL AND HIGHLY-EFFICIENT EPIGENETIC PROFILING TECHNOLOGY CALLED CUT&RUN WE WILL PROFILE H3K27ME3 SPECIFICALLY IN AMYGDALAR NEURONS AND NON-NEURONAL CELLS OF COMPULSIVE RATS. IN PARALLEL, THE FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCE OF DIFFERENTIAL H3K27ME3 WILL BE DEFINED USING RNA SEQUENCING. ADDITIONAL PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT INHIBITION OF GABAERGIC PROTEIN KINASE C DELTA (PRKCD) NEURONS IN THE AMYGDALA REDUCES COMPULSIVITY. TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF PRKCD-NEURONS, WE WILL SELECTIVELY MANIPULATE THEIR ACTIVITY USING CHEMOGENETICS, AND ASSESS THE EFFECTS ON COMPULSIVITY. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL UTILIZE A RECENTLY VALIDATED TRANSGENIC RAT MODEL THAT WE HAVE CREATED WHERE EXPRESSION OF CRE-RECOMBINASE IS DRIVEN BY THE ENDOGENOUS PRKCD PROMOTER. USING THE PRKCD-CRE RAT AND A CRE-INDUCIBLE NUCLEAR TAGGING APPROACH, WE WILL DEFINE DIFFERENTIAL H3K27ME3 LEVELS AND GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS SPECIFICALLY IN PRKCD-NEURONS OF COMPULSIVE RATS.

THE SAME IS TRUE FOR PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS A SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITY (SGM).

THE ALCOHOL RESEARCH GROUP AND ITS P50 ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTER HAVE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF NATIONAL ALCOHOL SURVEYS (NAS) FOR FORTY YEARS.

A RECENT REVIEW OF 23 STUDIES FOUND THAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS INCREASED RISK FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS (AUD), AND RELAPSE AMONG THOSE WITH A HISTORY OF AUD [8]. HOWEVER, RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHICH PARTICULAR DOMAINS OF THE PANDEMIC (E.G., ECONOMIC HARDSHIP, SOCIAL DISCONNECTION, DEATH OF A FAMILY MEMBER, DISRUPTION IN HEALTHCARE) ARE MOST STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN AUD TO IDENTIFY MODIFIABLE TARGETS FOR INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION EFFORTS. FURTHER, RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS AT GREATEST RISK FOR COVID-19 STRESS-RELATED AUD. EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT AMONG THOSE WITH HIGH POLYGENIC RISK FOR AUD, ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN TRAUMATIC STRESS AND AUD TEND TO BE GREATER, AND INVERSE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PROTECTIVE EXPOSURES (E.G., HEALTHY COPING ACTIVITIES) AND AUD TEND TO BE MINIMIZED. HOWEVER, WHETHER INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH GENETIC RISK ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO COVID-19 STRESS-RELATED AUD, OR EXPERIENCE LESS BENEFIT FROM HEALTHY COPING ACTIVITIES, IS UNKNOWN. RESEARCH HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH AUD DIFFER IN TERMS OF THEIR BRAIN FUNCTION, INCLUDING ALPHA EEG COHERENCE, A MEASURE OF NEURAL FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; LOWER ALPHA EEG HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AUD. WHILE DECADES OF RESEARCH HAVE FOCUSED ON NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES OBSERVED AMONG THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT AUD, NO PRIOR STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MEASURES OF NEURAL CONNECTIVITY, POLYGENIC RISK, AND TRAUMATIC STRESS WITH RESPECT TO HEIGHTENED RISK FOR AUD. PRELIMINARY COVID-19 DATA FROM THE COLLABORATIVE STUDY ON THE GENETICS OF ALCOHOLISM (COGA)\u2019S ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF ADULT PARTICIPANTS (AGES 30-90) WHO ARE AT RISK FOR AUD, HAVE ACTIVE AUD, OR PRIOR AUD, HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT COVID RELATED PERCEIVED STRESS, MEDIA CONSUMPTION, ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AND FAMILY COVID ILLNESS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ALCOHOL AND OTHER SUBSTANCE USE SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC, PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN, MID-LIFE (AGES 30-50) PARTICIPANTS WITH AUD (ACTIVE OR PRIOR), THOSE WITH HIGH POLYGENIC RISK FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE, AND THOSE WITH LOWER ALPHA EEG CONNECTIVITY.

SEVERE COVID-19 AND ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS APPEAR TO INCREASE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING POST-COVID-19 SYNDROME AND YET A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITHOUT KNOWN RISK FACTORS ALSO DEVELOP POST-COVID-19 SYNDROME. THUS, ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS LEADING TO POST-COVID-19 SYNDROME MUST EXIST. ONE POTENTIAL RISK FACTOR IS EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. (1) ALCOHOL IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED DRUG IN THE UNITED STATES, AND ALCOHOL USE INCREASES DURING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES, ESPECIALLY IN SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. (2) ALCOHOL RESULTS IN INAPPROPRIATE IMMUNE RESPONSES TO PATHOGENS. (3) ALCOHOL DISRUPTS INTESTINAL AND LUNG BARRIER INTEGRITY WHICH CAN FURTHER PROMOTE INFLAMMATION. WE RECENTLY SHOWED THAT INCREASED SERUM ZONULIN (A MARKER OF DISRUPTED INTESTINAL BARRIER INTEGRITY) AND INCREASED ENDOTOXIN (LBP) ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INFLAMMATION DURING COVID-19 AND CAN PREDICT DISEASE SEVERITY AND MORTALITY.

THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO URGENTLY ESTABLISH ADDRESSABLE FACTORS THAT DRIVE POOR OUTCOMES. PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, INVESTIGATIONS BY OUR RESEARCH GROUP DEMONSTRATED THAT ALCOHOL MISUSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED SEVERITY OF ARDS, WHICH MAY CONTRIBUTE TO RESIDUAL PULMONARY DYSFUNCTION IN SURVIVORS. ALCOHOL MISUSE CAN ALSO PROPAGATE DEVELOPMENT OF DELIRIUM THAT MAY INCREASE RISK FOR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN RECOVERY. NOTABLY, DELIRIUM HAS BEEN REPORTED IN HALF OF ALL COVID-19 PATIENTS IN THE ICU, AND ALCOHOL MISUSE APPEARS TO INCREASE ODDS FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH REPORTS OF INCREASING ALCOHOL MISUSE DURING THE PANDEMIC ARE WIDESPREAD AND MIGHT BE ONE MODIFIABLE FACTOR DRIVING SEVERITY OF ILLNESS AND OUTCOMES, ITS IMPACT ON THE TRAJECTORY OF ILLNESS IN COVID-19 HAS NOT BEEN FULLY EVALUATED.

WE HAVE CHARACTERIZED THE CELLULAR MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE ACTIONS OF ALCOHOL AND CRF ON GABA AND GLUTAMATE SIGNALING, AND THE NEUROADAPTATIONS INDUCED BY ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE IN CEA OF MALE RATS. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND THAT NE, LIKE CRF, STRONGLY MODULATES CEA GABAERGIC TRANSMISSION IN NAIVE, ALCOHOL DEPENDENT, AND WITHDRAWN MALE RATS, AND IDENTIFIED SPECIFIC ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS THAT MEDIATE THESE EFFECTS.

IN THE PROPOSED 8-MONTH TRIAL PLUS 4-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, 198 DYADS (DRINKER + FAMILY MEMBER) WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO: 1) SMARTPHONE CONTROL: BOTH RECEIVE A SMARTPHONE WITH STANDARD SUPPORT AND CRISIS NUMBERS; 2) ACHESS-C: DRINKER RECEIVES A PHONE WITH ACHESS-C, PARTNER RECEIVES A PHONE WITH SUPPORT AND CRISIS NUMBERS; 3) FAM-CHESS-C: BOTH RECEIVE PHONE WITH FAMCHESS-C. THE PROJECT HAS THE FOLLOWING AIMS: AIM 1: COMPLETE REFINEMENTS TO THE FAMCHESS-C APP. AIM 2: CONDUCT A BALANCED RCT TO TEST THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: PRIMARY: 1) DRINKER % HEAVY DRINKING DAYS, 2) DYAD QUALITY OF LIFE. SECONDARY: 3) DYAD RELATIONSHIP SATISFACTION, 4) DYAD PSYCHOLOGICAL/PHYSICAL CONFLICT, 5) DRINKER NO HEAVY DRINKING DAYS, 6) DRINKER % DAYS ALCOHOL/DRUG USE, 7) DYAD COVID VACCINATION RATES, 8) DRINKER ALCOHOL- AND DRUG-RELATED PROBLEMS.

AMPLITUDE AND DURATION OF CAMP SIGNALING IS FINE-TUNED BY PHOSPHODIESTERASES (PDES) VIA CAMP HYDROLYSIS AND DEGRADATION. OUR WORK HAS SHOWN THAT ETHANOL INCREASES EXPRESSION OF HEPATIC PDE4 IN EXPERIMENTAL ALD AS WELL AS IN ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED HEPATITIS (AH) PATIENTS\u2019 LIVERS. HOWEVER, THEIR ROLE IN ALD PATHOGENESIS IS NOT CLEAR. WE STARTED ELUCIDATING THE ROLE OF PDE4S IN ALD BY DEMONSTRATING THAT PDE4B PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN ETHANOL- MEDIATED IMPAIRMENT OF FATTY ACID SS-OXIDATION AND STEATOSIS. WE ALSO SHOWED THAT INHIBITION OF PDE4 ACTIVITY ATTENUATES LIVER INJURY IN IN VIVO AND IN VITRO MODELS OF ALD.

OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES USING ANIMAL AND CELL MODELS OF ALD IDENTIFIED NOVEL PATHWAYS OF ETHANOL AND PDE4- MEDIATED REGULATION OF HEPATIC LIPID METABOLISM AND CELL INJURY WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN EXAMINED BEFORE.

THE RELAPSE RATE OF ALCOHOLISM IS PARTICULARLY HIGH (75-95%). IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT DRUG CRAVING IS A CRITICAL PRECIPITATING FACTOR TO RELAPSE AND DRUG CRAVING IS INFLUENCED BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME ABSTINENT, THE EXPOSURE TO THE DRUG-PAIRED ENVIRONMENT, OR DRUG-PAIRED CUES. CONVERGENT DATA IN RODENTS AND HUMANS HAVE INDICATED THAT DRUG-PAIRED ENVIRONMENT OR DRUG-PAIRED CUES' ABILITY TO ELICIT DRUG-CRAVING INTENSIFIES WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME DURING EARLY ABSTINENCE, WHICH CAN BE REFERRED TO AS \u2018CUE INCUBATION OF DRUG CRAVING\u2019. THE SEROTONIN (5-HT) SYSTEM IS THOUGHT TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL ADDICTION AS WELL AS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CONTROL OF DRUG-SEEKING AND SENSITIVITY TO DRUG REWARD AND DRUG CUES. THE 5-HT7 RECEPTOR HAS BEEN RESEARCHED AS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR VARIOUS CONDITIONS SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, NEUROPATHIC PAIN, ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE, AND DRUG ADDICTION. THE ACTIVATION OF 5-HT7 RECEPTORS CAN REGULATE \u2018BEHAVIOR CONTROL,\u2019 DRUG-WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS, AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A GAP IN KNOWLEDGE OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE 5-HT7 RECEPTOR IN MEDIATING ALCOHOL (ETOH)-SEEKING BEHAVIORS. EXTENSIVE PRELIMINARY DATA CONDUCTED IN OUR LABORATORY HAVE INDICATED THAT THE SYSTEMIC AND SITE-SPECIFIC, SPECIFICALLY IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS SHELL (ACBSH), PHARMACOLOGICAL MANIPULATION OF 5-HT7 RECEPTOR BIDIRECTIONALLY MEDIATES CONTEXT- AND CUE-INDUCED ETOH-SEEKING. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR THERAPEUTIC TREATMENTS FOR ETOH- SEEKING BEHAVIORS AND WE PROPOSE THAT THE 5-HT7 RECEPTORS NEED TO BE FURTHER RESEARCHED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR TREATMENTS OF ALCOHOL \u2018CRAVING\u2019 BEHAVIORS. UNDERSTANDING 5-HT7 MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTING TO THE \u2018INCUBATION\u2019 OF CUE-INDUCED ETOH-SEEKING IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO REDUCE OR PREVENT RELAPSE. THE PAVLOVIAN SPONTANEOUS RECOVERY (PSR) MODEL OF ETOH SEEKING, PHARMACOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES, AND VIRAL VECTORS WILL BE USED TO EXAMINE THE TEMPORAL EFFECTS OF \u2018INCUBATION\u2019 OF CUE-INDUCED ETOH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS AND DETERMINE 5-HT7 RECEPTORS' INVOLVEMENT IN REGULATING THESE BEHAVIORS.

WHILE GENETIC VARIATION CAN INFLUENCE AN INDIVIDUAL'S VULNERABILITY TO AUD, CHRONIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION CAN ALSO LEAD TO ALCOHOL TOLERANCE AND DEPENDENCE, BUT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM IS UNCLEAR. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THAT CHRONIC ALCOHOL USE ALTERS DNA METHYLATION OF SPECIFIC GENES, LEADING TO GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES AND POSSIBLY AN INCREASED RISK OF AUD. RNA METHYLATION IS A COMMON POST- TRANSCRIPTIONAL MODIFICATION, AND IT RESPONDS RAPIDLY TO A VARIETY OF STIMULI AND TRANSLATES STIMULATORY SIGNALS INTO CELLULAR ACTIVITY. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ALCOHOL USE ALTERS AN INDIVIDUAL'S RNA METHYLOME (OR EPITRANSCRIPTOME), RESULTING IN ALTERED EXPRESSION OF GENES INVOLVED IN AUD-RELATED PATHWAYS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE MESSENGER RNA (MRNA) METHYLOMIC CHANGES IN THE BRAIN OF AUD SUBJECTS AND ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF MRNA METHYLATION ON MRNA EXPRESSION AND NEURONAL ACTIVITY, THUS PROVIDING EVIDENCE FOR A NEW GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORY MECHANISM OF AUD. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE PROPOSE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. FIRST, WE WILL PROFILE MRNA METHYLOMIC AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC CHANGES IN EIGHT REGIONS (AMYGDALA, CAUDATE, CEREBELLUM, HIPPOCAMPUS, NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS, PREFRONTAL CORTEX, PUTAMEN, AND VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA) OF POSTMORTEM BRAINS OF AUD SUBJECTS.

THIRD, WE WILL EMPLOY A NOVEL EPITRANSCRIPTOME EDITING APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF AUD- ASSOCIATED MRNA METHYLATION CHANGES ON MRNA EXPRESSION AND NEURONAL ACTIVITY. WE EXPECT TO (1) OBSERVE AUD-ASSOCIATED MRNA METHYLATION AND EXPRESSION CHANGES IN SPECIFIC (OR ACROSS) BRAIN REGIONS; (2) VERIFY AUD- ASSOCIATED MRNA METHYLATION AND EXPRESSION CHANGES BY MOUSE MODELING; AND (3) CONFIRM THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF AUD-ASSOCIATED MRNA METHYLATION IN REGULATING MRNA EXPRESSION AND NEURONAL ACTIVITY.

AN INTEGRATIVE STUDY APPROACH (HUMAN POSTMORTEM BRAIN STUDIES, MOUSE MODELING, AND EPITRANSCRIPTOME EDITING) WILL BE EMPLOYED.

ETHANOL MAJOR METABOLITE, ACETALDEHYDE (AA), IS SUGGESTED TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN HEAD AND NECK CANCERS BY REACTING WITH DNA. THESE REACTIONS GENERATE CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS (DNA ADDUCTS) THAT, IF NOT REPAIRED, MAY RESULT IN MUTATIONS AND ULTIMATELY LEAD TO CANCER. INDIVIDUALS WITH GENETIC DEFICIENCIES IN ALDH2, THE ENZYME RESPONSIBLE FOR AA DETOXIFICATION, WERE SHOWN TO HAVE A 15% INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ORAL CANCER WHEN DRINKING.5 ADDITIONALLY, FANCONI ANEMIA (FA) PATIENTS, WHO HAVE IMPAIRED MECHANISMS TO REPAIR AA-RELATED DNA DAMAGE, HAVE AN AVERAGE 500-FOLD HIGHER CHANCE OF DEVELOPING ORAL CANCER.6 PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A DIRECT AND DOSE-DEPENDENT CONNECTION BETWEEN ETHANOL CONSUMED AND AA-DERIVED DNA DAMAGE, IN THE ORAL CAVITY OF HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS.7 THIS EFFECT WAS NOT AS EVIDENT IN BLOOD DNA FROM THE SAME INDIVIDUALS, INDICATING A DISTINCT CONTRIBUTION OF AA EXPOSURE COMING FROM ORAL ETHANOL METABOLISM BY THE MUCOSA AND ORAL MICROBIOME. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AA RESULTING FROM ORAL METABOLISM OF ETHANOL IS PLAYING A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ORAL CANCER THROUGH THE FORMATION OF DNA ADDUCTS, AND THAT LEVELS AND PERSISTENCE OF DRIVER ADDUCTS WILL INCREASE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH INCREASING ORAL CANCER RISK. USING CUTTING-EDGE ANALYTICAL APPROACHES, OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CHARACTERIZE ETHANOL'S ORAL METABOLISM AND ITS CORRESPONDING DNA DAMAGE AND MUTATIONAL PROFILES, TO DEVELOP A SYSTEMATIC ASSEMBLY OF BIOMARKERS FOR IDENTIFYING ORAL CANCER RISK AND FOR DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR EARLY DETECTION AND PREVENTION.

ADDITIONALLY, THE ORAL MICROBIOME WILL BE CHARACTERIZED IN SAMPLES FROM NON-DRINKERS, INCLUDED TO INVESTIGATE IF ETHANOL CONSUMPTION RESULTS IN A SPECIFIC PROFILE. FINALLY, THE THIRD AIM WILL ANALYZE GENOME-SCALE MUTATIONAL SIGNATURES IN ORAL CELL LINES EXPOSED TO AA, FOR WHICH DNA ADDUCTS WILL BE PROFILED, AND IN ORAL TUMOR TISSUES FROM RATS CHRONICALLY EXPOSED TO AA OR ETHANOL.

AN IMPORTANT GAP IN CURRENT CLINICAL RESEARCH IS LACK OF HUMAN LABORATORY STUDIES THAT EXAMINE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN RELATION TO CANNABIS VARYING IN CANNABINOID COMPOSITION (THC AND CBD).

THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEVELOP AND TEST A TRANSLATIONAL TASK OF MOTIVATION FOR ALCOHOL IN HUMANS. TO DO SO, WE COMBINED ALCOHOL CHALLENGE WITH PROGRESSIVE RATIO SELF-ADMINISTRATION METHODOLOGIES. ALCOHOL WAS ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY USING THE COMPUTER-ASSISTED SELF-INFUSION OF ETHANOL (CASE) SYSTEM. AT BRAC = 0.06 G/DL, PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A PROGRESSIVE RATIO SELF-ADMINISTRATION TASK IN WHICH THEY WERE ALLOWED TO WORK TO BE INFUSED MORE ALCOHOL FOLLOWING A PROGRESSIVE RATIO SCHEDULE. THE ALCOHOL SELF-ADMINISTRATION TASK CAPTURES MOTIVATION FOR ALCOHOL AND MIRRORS PRECLINICAL METHODOLOGIES, IDEAL FOR TESTING OF TRANSLATIONAL HYPOTHESES. IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THE \u201cOUTCOME SIDE\u201d OF THE MODELING APPROACH, THE \u201cPREDICTOR SIDE\u201d COMPRISED OF AUD PHENOMENOLOGY HAS PROGRESSED TOWARDS CLINICAL TRANSLATION. THE ADDICTION NEUROCLINICAL ASSESSMENT (ANA) PROPOSED TO PARSE AUD PHENOMENOLOGY INTO THREE DOMAINS, NAMELY INCENTIVE SALIENCE, NEGATIVE EMOTIONALITY, AND EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION. OUR RESEARCH GROUP HAS RECENTLY PROVIDED AN INDEPENDENT REPLICATION OF THE ANA FRAMEWORK IN A SAMPLE OF 1,679 HEAVY DRINKERS. TOGETHER WITH THE INNOVATION IN OUTCOME ASSESSMENT (I.E., PROGRESSIVE RATIO SELF-ADMINISTRATION IN HUMANS), THE ANA FRAMEWORK CAN INFORM STAGING OF AUD PROGRESSION AND AS SUCH, MOTIVATION FOR ALCOHOL IN HUMANS PROVIDES AN IDEAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE OUTCOME.

A COMMON COGNITIVE MANIFESTATION OF ALCOHOL EXPOSURE DURING NEURAL DEVELOPMENT IN HUMANS, AND IN ANIMAL MODELS OF PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE), ARE DEFICITS IN SPATIAL LEARNING AND MEMORY. IN MODERATE PAE, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE MOST COMMON AND UNDERESTIMATED FORM OF PAE, SPATIAL DEFICITS ARE MARKED BY AN INABILITY TO ACCURATELY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN SPATIAL LOCATIONS OR RECALL PREVIOUSLY LEARNED SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS. SYSTEMS-LEVEL MONITORING OF NEURAL POPULATIONS IN THE HIPPOCAMPAL FORMATION HAS UNRAVELED A CRITICAL ROLE FOR THIS CIRCUIT IN THE GENERATION OF SPATIAL MEMORIES AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT RECALL. THE WELL-CHARACTERIZED SPATIAL AND OSCILLATORY ORGANIZATION OF HIPPOCAMPAL SPIKING IS THOUGHT TO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THESE PROCESSES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO IDENTIFY THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF SPATIAL LEARNING AND MEMORY IMPAIRMENTS AFTER MODERATE PAE.

ALTHOUGH CLINICAL STUDIES ON LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE) ARE SPARSE, HIGH PREVALENCE OF SUBSTANCE USE (E.G., ALCOHOL, OPIOIDS) IS OBSERVED IN ADULT FASD POPULATIONS WHICH MAY STEM FROM ABERRANT NEUROIMMUNE INTERACTIONS FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO ALCOHOL OR OPIOIDS. THIS PROPOSAL EXAMINES WHETHER PAE INDUCES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEUROIMMUNE DYSFUNCTION FOLLOWING OPIOID PAIN THERAPY IN ANIMAL MODELS. IN PAE ANIMAL MODELS, HEIGHTENED PRODUCTION OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES INCLUDING INTERLEUKIN-1SS (IL-1SS) IN THE ADULT CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) IS OBSERVED. OUR RECENT WORK IN ANIMAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT PAE IS A RISK FACTOR FOR DEVELOPING CNS PATHOLOGY SUCH AS PATHOLOGICAL PAIN (ALLODYNIA) THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF SPINAL ASTROCYTE AND MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION BY THEIR RELEASE OF IL-1SS AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-A (TNF-A). A CRITICAL INNATE IMMUNE RECEPTOR UNDERLYING INCREASED IL-1SS AND TNF-A IS TOLL LIKE RECEPTOR (TLR4), THAT UPON ITS ACTIVATION, PRODUCES DOWNSTREAM NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME SIGNALING AND CONSEQUENT IL-1SS. CURIOUSLY, MORPHINE, A STANDARD PAIN THERAPEUTIC ACTING ON THE \u039c-OPIOID RECEPTOR, ALSO ACTIVATES PROINFLAMMATORY TLR4 SIGNALING RESULTING IN OPPONENT PROCESSES; \u039c-OPIOID CELLULAR ACTIONS TO BLUNT PAIN AND IMMUNE TLR4 CELLULAR ACTIONS THAT CAUSE PAIN. CONSEQUENTLY, HIGHER DOSES OF MORPHINE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE PAIN ALLEVIATION IN SOME POPULATIONS. BASED ON THIS BACKGROUND, WE SPECULATE THAT PAE MAY GENERATE BIOLOGICAL VULNERABILITY TO CNS PATHOLOGY BY SENSITIZING TLR4 RESPONSES TO ENDOGENOUS FACTORS AND MORPHINE THAT READILY INTERACT WITH TLR4. THUS, ONE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO IDENTIFY IF MORPHINE TREATMENT IN MICE UNMASKS THE INSIDIOUS EFFECTS OF PAE ON NEUROIMMUNE FUNCTION RESULTING IN CHRONIC CNS PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES.

THIS LACK OF THERAPEUTIC COUNTERMEASURES IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE LACK OF A MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF FASD PATHOGENESIS. WHILE PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE) TARGETS MULTIPLE TISSUE TYPES AND SYSTEMS, THE BRAIN IS THE MOST SEVERELY AFFECTED ORGAN. AUTOPSY CASES ON HUMAN FETUSES AND INFANTS WITH A HISTORY OF PAE DOCUMENT ABNORMAL VASCULARIZATION OF THE BRAIN AND HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC NEURONAL CHANGES OR RESOLVING BRAIN HEMORRHAGE. WORK ON ANIMAL MODELS DEMONSTRATES THAT PAE WITH MATERNAL BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVELS AVERAGING 80-85 MG/DL DILATES FETAL CEREBRAL ARTERIES IN VIVO INDEPENDENT OF CHANGES IN SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION, FETAL HEART FUNCTION, BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER, BLOOD PH, OR PO2. THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DILATED FETAL CEREBRAL ARTERIES IS EXPECTED TO BE PROFOUND.

A RECENT REVIEW IN ADDICTION ARGUED THAT RESEARCH INFORMING INTERVENTIONS FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COMPLEXITY OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO YOUNG ADULT ALCOHOL MISUSE. WE WILL ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BY EXAMINING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TWO CARDINAL ETIOLOGIC RISK FACTORS: IMPULSIVITY AND SUBJECTIVE RESPONSE TO ALCOHOL (SR). DESPITE THEORETICAL AND BIOLOGICAL LINKS BETWEEN THEM, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO RISK FACTORS, OR HOW ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THEM MAY PROMOTE YOUNG ADULT ALCOHOL MISUSE LONGITUDINALLY AND ON A MOMENTARY OR DAILY BASIS.

IN ADDITION, OF ALL IMPULSIVITY SUBTYPES A RECENT META-ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT NON-PLANNING IMPULSIVITY IS A STRONG PREDICTOR OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE IN HUMANS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO EXPLORE THE NEURAL BASIS OF PLANNING AND IMPULSIVITY TO INSPIRE NOVEL TREATMENT APPROACHES CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING THIS PATHOLOGY.

A SERIES OF PRECLINICAL STUDIES ARE PROPOSED THAT WILL USE RIGOROUS AND CUTTING-EDGE TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE AND MANIPULATE NEURAL ACTIVITY IN AWAKE, BEHAVING RODENTS. HETEROGENEITY IN THE ANIMAL MODELS USED WILL BROADEN THE IMPACT OF THE RESULTS BY MAKING THEM APPLICABLE TO THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT FAMILY HISTORY/GENETIC RISK FACTORS FOR PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE AS WELL AS SEX DIFFERENCES.

WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN IN RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO- CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS THE BENEFIT AND SAFETY OF DIFFERENT FMT FORMULATIONS IN CIRRHOSIS. FURTHERMORE, IN A RECENT RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF ACTIVELY DRINKING AUD CIRRHOTIC PATIENTS, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT FMT REDUCED ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND CRAVING, AND IMPROVED COGNITION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) VERSUS PLACEBO. WE ALSO FOUND SIMILAR ENGRAFTMENT WITH CAPSULE VERSUS ENEMA FMT. THE FDA REGULATES FMT AS A DRUG AND A BIOLOGIC. OUR GROUP USES GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES TO MANUFACTURE FMT PRODUCTS IN BOTH LIQUID AND FREEZE-DRIED, ENCAPSULATED FORMULATIONS. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT RESTRUCTURING THE GUT MICROBIOTA USING FMT WILL REDUCE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION COMPARED TO PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH AUD AND CIRRHOSIS. TO TEST THIS, WE WILL CONDUCT A PHASE 1B/2A DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL USING ADMINISTRATION OF A STANDARDIZED ORAL ENCAPSULATED FMT PREPARATION (FMT) AT BASELINE AND DAY 30 IN PATIENTS WITH AUD AND CIRRHOSIS. AIM 1: MEASURE THE EFFECT OF FMT ON ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS NUMBER OF ABSTINENT DAYS AT THREE MONTHS IN FMT COMPARED TO PLACEBO. WE WILL ASSESS DAILY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND CRAVINGS USING PATIENT-REPORTED MEASURES AND OBJECTIVE URINARY AND PLASMA MARKERS. AIM 2: DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF FMT ON SAFETY AND LIVER DYSFUNCTION. WE WILL MONITOR SAFETY OUTCOMES AND LIVER FUNCTION THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL. AIM 3: DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF FMT ON MICROBIAL COMPOSITIONAL AND FUNCTION. COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF STOOL MICROBIAL COMPOSITION, AND SERUM METABOLOMICS WILL BE PERFORMED BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUPS. TARGETED METABOLOMICS WILL BE FOCUSED ON NEUROACTIVE METABOLITES THAT ARE PRODUCED OR MODULATED BY MICROBIOTA, E.G., SCFA, -AMINOBUTYRIC ACID (GABA), GLUTAMATE, INDOLIC COMPOUNDS, AND BILE ACIDS. AIM 4: DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF FMT ON BRAIN DYSFUNCTION AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES USING COGNITIVE TESTING AND HRQOL TESTING. WE WILL EVALUATE HRQOL AND COGNITION USING VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS (SICKNESS IMPACT PROFILE, ENCEPHALAPP STROOP, PSYCHOMETRIC HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY SCORE).

ONE COMMON FACTOR PRESENTED TO ALL THE USERS OF ALCOHOL IS THE SET OF CUES CLOSELY LINKED TO ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CUES THAT RELIABLY PRECEDE ALCOHOL AVAILABILITY AND SUBSEQUENT CONSUMPTION CAN GAIN THE ABILITY TO ELICIT CONDITIONED RESPONSES SUCH AS ALCOHOL-SEEKING BEHAVIOR AND PROMOTE PROBLEMATIC DRINKING.  CURRENT TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER INCLUDES CUE-EXPOSURE THERAPY, A BEHAVIORAL PROCEDURE IN WHICH ALCOHOL CUES ARE SYSTEMATICALLY PRESENTED IN THE ABSENCE OF ALCOHOL TO PROMOTE A REDUCTION OR \u201cEXTINCTION\u201d OF CUE-CONDITIONED RESPONSES. UNFORTUNATELY, EXTINCTION IS RARELY PERMANENT: EXTINGUISHED CUE-CONDITIONED ALCOHOL-SEEKING RESPONSES ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO RELAPSE. WE RECENTLY SHOWED THAT A MODIFICATION TO STANDARD EXTINCTION PROCEDURE (I.E., CUE-INDUCED MEMORY RETRIEVAL SESSION PRIOR TO EXTINCTION) BLOCKED THE RETURN OF ALCOHOL- SEEKING BEHAVIOR OF RATS WITH MODERATE LEVEL OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (COFRESI ET AL., 2017).

EXISTING INTERVENTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE BYSTANDER TRAINING, EDUCATION PROGRAMS, AND BRIEF INTERVENTIONS, TAKE AN ESSENTIALLY GLOBAL APPROACH TO THE PREVENTION OF HARMFUL ALCOHOL USE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE, AND LARGELY NEGLECT THE SOCIAL AND SITUATIONAL CONTEXTS IN WHICH DRINKING OCCURS. A COMBINATION OF CAMPUS POLICIES, BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, AND COMMUNITY-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS ARE LIKELY NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS COMPLEX PROBLEM. ALCOHOL-INVOLVED SEXUAL VIOLENCE CAN BE CONCEPTUALIZED AS A SYSTEM WITH FEEDBACK LOOPS BETWEEN VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL BEHAVIORS AS WELL AS BETWEEN CONTEXTS AND BEHAVIORS. AGENT-BASED MODELS (ABMS) ARE A METHODOLOGICAL TOOL THAT CAN INCORPORATE DYNAMICS BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL, SOCIAL, AND STRUCTURAL ENVIRONMENTS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON HAZARDOUS ALCOHOL USE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE. THEY CAN BE USED TO SIMULATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERVENTION(S) ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND POPULATIONS. THE USEFULNESS OF A GIVEN ABM, HOWEVER, IS LIMITED BY ITS ACCURACY, FOCUS, AND SALIENCE TO END USERS. A STAKEHOLDER-ENGAGED MODEL-BUILDING PROCESS GREATLY ENHANCES THE RELEVANCE AND USEFULNESS OF MODELS THAT EXPLICITLY ACCOUNT FOR DYNAMIC PROCESSES. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO CREATE A STAKEHOLDER-DESIGNED ABM THAT CAN SERVE AS A DECISION SUPPORT TOOL TO HELP CAMPUSES REDUCE ALCOHOL-INVOLVED SEXUAL VIOLENCE AMONG STUDENTS. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE WILL FIRST DEVELOP A STAKEHOLDER-DESIGNED SYSTEMS MODEL OF HAZARDOUS DRINKING, SV, AND INTERVENTION OPPORTUNITIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES THROUGH A SERIES OF STAKEHOLDER-ENGAGED MODEL BUILDING SESSIONS GUIDED BY A CORE MODELING TEAM (AIM 1).

INDIVIDUALS WITH ADVANCED CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE (CLD) ARE AMONG THOSE MOST STRONGLY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN CARE AND ARE ALSO HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO POOR OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH SARS-COV-2 INFECTION. IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE PATIENTS DURING THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THE RISING PREVALENCE OF CIRRHOSIS, AN END-STAGE OF CLD, IS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALCOHOL USE IS A MAJOR RISK FACTOR. THUS, EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR ALCOHOL CESSATION IS A HIGH-PRIORITY NEED. IN ADDITION, HIGH QUALITY ADVANCED CLD WITH ADHERENCE TO KNOWN QUALITY INDICATORS IS ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE PATIENT OUTCOMES, CRITICAL TO ENHANCED SURVIVAL, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING VETERANS AND THOSE RECEIVING CARE IN SAFETY NET SYSTEMS ARE AT SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR LIVER AND COVID-19 RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES. THEY ALSO HAVE KNOWN BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DISENGAGEMENT FROM CARE. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED THE TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODELS, BUT THE IMPACT ON OUTCOMES OF VULNERABLE PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CLD IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. MOREOVER, THE WIDESPREAD USE OF TELEMEDICINE AS A MITIGATION STRATEGY WITHIN THESE HEALTH SYSTEMS DUE TO COVID-19 HAS PROVIDED AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY FOR EVALUATION AND INNOVATION OF CARE DELIVERY MODELS. BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PATIENTS' EXPERIENCE WITH TELEMEDICINE AND IMPACT ON THEIR OUTCOMES IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO ESTABLISH PROCESSES AND POLICES THAT ENSURE EQUITY IN ACCESS, SUSTAINABILITY, AND HIGH-QUALITY CARE DELIVERY.

CONVERSELY, THE DORSOLATERAL STRIATUM (DLS) IS NECESSARY FOR HABITUAL ACTIONS AS LESIONS OR TEMPORARY INACTIVATION OF DLS BIAS BEHAVIOR TOWARDS GOAL- DIRECTED ACTIONS. SINCE GABAERGIC IMSNS PROJECT TO EXTERNAL GLOBUS PALLIDUS (GPE), WE ALSO EXAMINED THE ROLE OF ASTROCYTE IN THE GPE. INTERESTINGLY, BOTH CHEMOGENETIC ASTROCYTE ACTIVATION OF DMS AND GPE PROMOTES TRANSITION FROM HABITUAL TO GOAL-DIRECTED ETHANOL-SEEKING BEHAVIORS. HOWEVER, THE PRECISE ROLE OF ASTROCYTES IN THE DMS-GPE OR DLS-GPE CIRCUITS IN REGULATING HABITUAL ETHANOL SEEKING BEHAVIOR HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ASTROCYTE ACTIVITIES DIFFERENTIALLY REGULATE MSNS ACTIVITIES IN THE DMS AND DLS, THEREBY DETERMINE GOAL-DIRECTED AND HABITUAL ETHANOL-SEEKING BEHAVIORS. TO INVESTIGATE THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE PROPOSE THREE AIMS. FIRST, WE WILL DETERMINE HOW ACTIVATION OF ASTROCYTE ACTIVITIES DIFFERENTIALLY REGULATES THE ALCOHOL-INDUCED CHANGES IN GLUTAMATERGIC AND GABAERGIC SIGNALING OF THE DMS AND DLS. SECOND, WE PLAN TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF DMS AND DLS ASTROCYTE ACTIVATION IN GOAL- DIRECTED OR HABITUAL ETHANOL-SEEKING BEHAVIORS. FINALLY, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF ABLATION OF DMS- GPE AND DLS-GPE CIRCUITS IN GOAL-DIRECTED OR HABITUAL ETHANOL-SEEKING BEHAVIORS.

THESE OBJECTIVES ARE CONSISTENT WITH TWO KEY PRIORITIES OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM (NIAAA): 1) IDENTIFY MECHANISMS OF AUDS, AND 2) IMPROVE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE. THE PROPOSED MODEL OF AUD POSITS THAT SLEEP DURATION AND/OR TIMING MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS ON HIGH-RISK ALCOHOL USE BY DISRUPTING REWARD- AND STRESS-RELATED BRAIN FUNCTION.

OWING TO THE LACK OF EARLY DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS, HCC'S 5-YEAR SURVIVAL IS ONLY 10%. ALCOHOLISM IS A WELL-KNOWN HCC RISK FACTOR, BUT THE MECHANISM OF HOW ALCOHOL INDUCES HCC IS STILL UNCLEAR. ANOTHER HCC RISK FACTOR IS CONSUMPTION OF DIETARY FRUCTOSE, ESPECIALLY IN LIQUID FORM (SOFT DRINKS), WHICH HAS INCREASED 100-FOLD OVER THE PAST TWO CENTURIES. BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT FRUCTOSE ALTERS HEPATIC ALCOHOL METABOLISM VIA INDUCTION OF ACETYL-COA SYNTHETASE 2 (ACSS2), WHICH ENHANCES THE HEPATIC USAGE OF ALCOHOL CARBONS TO GENERATE CARCINOGENIC METABOLITES AND THEREBY CREATES A PRO-TUMORIGENIC ENVIRONMENT. WHEN ALCOHOL REACHES THE LIVER, IT IS CONVERTED TO ACETATE AND MOSTLY RELEASED INTO CIRCULATION. HOWEVER, WHEN ACSS2 IS ACTIVATED, FLUX IS SHIFTED FROM ACETATE RELEASE TO ACETATE CATABOLISM, RESULTING IN EXCESSIVE PRODUCTION OF ACETYL-COA, A HIGH-ENERGY- CHARGED, REACTIVE METABOLITE. THIS ALTERATION CAN INITIATE AND SUPPORT HCC IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING CARCINOGENIC METABOLITE PRODUCTION. INDEED, ACSS OVEREXPRESSION AND INCREASED ACETATE USAGE ARE COMMONLY OBSERVED IN CANCERS INCLUDING HCC. WE RECENTLY FOUND THAT MICE EXPOSED TO FRUCTOSE SHOWED STRONGLY INDUCED HEPATIC ACSS2 ACTIVITY AND ACETATE USAGE. THUS, FRUCTOSE DRINKING WILL SHIFT THE METABOLIC FATE OF ALCOHOL FROM RELEASE AS ACETATE TO USAGE OF ACETATE WITHIN THE LIVER. FRUCTOSE DRINKING ALSO INDUCES GUT LEAKINESS AND ALTERS MICROBIOTA METABOLISM. THE RESULTING TOXIC MICROBIOTA METABOLITES CAUSE CHRONIC HEPATIC INFLAMMATION, WHICH IS A PRO-TUMORIGENIC MICROENVIRONMENT. WE WILL TEST THESE HYPOTHESES BY SYSTEMATICALLY DEFINING THE IMPACT OF FRUCTOSE-ELICITED ACSS2 INDUCTION AND MICROBIOTA CHANGES ON LIVER ALCOHOL METABOLIC FLUX.

THIS PROPOSAL PURSUES OUR FINDING THAT ACUTE ETHANOL (ETOH) EXPOSURE DISRUPTS SRC KINASE ACTIVITY IN EMBRYONIC CORTICAL NEURONS. SRC IS A CRITICAL NON-RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE THAT SITS AT CENTRAL POSITIONS IN MULTIPLE SIGNALING PATHWAYS INCLUDING THE REELIN-DAB1 SIGNALING PATHWAY WHICH CONTROLS BRAIN LAYER FORMATION AND DENDRITOGENESIS. WE FOUND THAT ACUTE ETOH EXPOSURE ACTIVATES SRC AND INDUCES PHOSPHORYLATION OF MANY PROTEINS INCLUDING DAB1, AN ESSENTIAL ADAPTOR PROTEIN IN THE REELIN-SIGNALING PATHWAY. REMARKABLY, THIS DRAMATIC INCREASE IN PHOSPHORYLATION IS FOLLOWED BY A SUSTAINED DEPHOSPHORYLATION RESPONSE IN WHICH THE PHOSPHORYLATION OF REELIN EFFECTORS INCLUDING DAB1, SRC ITSELF AND THE ACTIN SEVERING PROTEIN N-COFILIN RETURN TO BASELINE LEVELS, OR BELOW. DURING THE EXTENDED DEPHOSPHORYLATION PHASE, THE REELIN-SIGNALING PATHWAY CAN NO LONGER BE ACTIVATED BY IN VITRO APPLICATION OF ITS LIGAND, REELIN. IN AIM 1 OF THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER REELIN-DAB1 SILENCING OCCURS IN VIVO AFTER MATERNAL DOSING WITH ETOH. WE WILL THEN DETERMINE WHETHER GENETIC DEFICIENCY IN SRC PREVENTS THE PHOSPHORYLATION AND DEPHOSPHORYLATION RESPONSES.

THE STRENGTH OF THIS ASSOCIATION WILL DIFFER ACCORDING TO AN INDIVIDUALS\u2019 INCOME AND LOCAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT. HOWEVER, ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZED RIDESHARING MAY PRODUCE CONCOMITANT INCREASES IN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION BECAUSE GREATER MOBILITY MAKES IT CHEAPER AND EASIER FOR CONSUMERS TO OBTAIN AND CONSUME ALCOHOL.

A BALANCED INTESTINAL HOMEOSTASIS IS ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY AND MICROBIAL TRANSLOCATION TO THE LIVER.

STRESSORS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ASSOCIATED RESPONSE POLICIES (E.G., STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS, CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES) MAY HAVE INCREASED ALCOHOL MISUSE PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND JOB LOSS, LIKE RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND WOMEN. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE NIAAA PRIORITIES DESCRIBED IN NOT-AA-20- 011, HELPING TO LAY GROUNDWORK FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES SUCH AS COVID-19.

PROSPECTIVE STUDIES ARE RARE IN DISASTER RESEARCH, BUT THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL ADDRESS THIS GAP BY COLLECTING TWO NEW WAVES OF SURVEY DATA FROM AN EXISTING, POPULATION REPRESENTATIVE COHORT OF 2,520 GULF COAST RESIDENTS WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING SINCE 2016 VIA THE SURVEY OF TRAUMA, RESILIENCE, AND OPPORTUNITY IN NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE GULF (STRONG). THE NEW WORK WILL BUILD ON EXTENSIVE BASELINE DATA ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, ALCOHOL MISUSE, EMPLOYMENT HISTORY, DISASTER EXPOSURE, AND SOCIAL RESOURCES.

TWO FACTORS UNIQUE TO COVID-19 ARE MASSIVE INCREASES IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND GROWING FEELINGS OF LONELINESS CAUSED BY STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS, BOTH OF WHICH MIGHT CHANGE PEOPLE'S DRINKING BEHAVIOR. THROUGH TWO NEW SURVEY WAVES WE WILL: ESTIMATE THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGES IN FREQUENCY AND QUANTITY OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION FOLLOWING THE ONSET OF COVID-19; EXAMINE TRAJECTORIES OF CHANGE IN ALCOHOL MISUSE WITHIN INDIVIDUALS; IDENTIFY PRE-COVID-19 PREDICTORS OF PATTERNS OF CHANGE (E.G., DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, CUMULATIVE TRAUMA EXPOSURE, CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS); AND DETERMINE WHETHER COVID-19-RELATED LOSSES (I.E., UNEMPLOYMENT, LONELINESS) PREDICT CHANGE IN ALCOHOL USE OVER TIME.

COMORBIDITY IS BOTH COMMON IN AUD TREATMENT PATIENTS (UP TO 50%) AND CONFERS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE RISK OF A RETURN TO DRINKING IN THE MONTHS FOLLOWING TREATMENT. BECAUSE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SIMPLY ADDING A STANDARD PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT DOES NOT SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE AUD OUTCOMES OF COMORBID INDIVIDUALS, WE DEVELOPED A CBT-BASED INTERVENTION AIMED AT DISRUPTING THE POSITIVE-FEEDBACK LOOP (\u201cVICIOUS CYCLE\u201d; VC) OF MUTUALLY AGGRAVATING NEGATIVE AFFECT AND DRINKING BEHAVIOR/URGES (THE \u201cVC-CBT\u201d). IN AN RCT, AUD TREATMENT PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED THE THERAPIST- DELIVERED VC-CBT DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED ALCOHOL USE OUTCOMES AS COMPARED TO THOSE WHO RECEIVED A STANDARD ANXIETY TREATMENT. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST COMMUNITY-BASED AUD TREATMENT PROGRAMS DO NOT HAVE CLINICAL STAFF WITH THE SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE NEEDED TO DELIVER THE VC-CBT. TO HELP BRIDGE THIS \u201cRESEARCH-TO-PRACTICE\u201d GAP, WE WENT ON TO DEVELOP A FULLY AUTONOMOUS AND INTERACTIVE COMPUTER- DELIVERED VERSION OF THE VC-CBT AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED ITS FUNCTIONALITY IN AUD PATIENTS.

COMPARED TO NON-SGM POPULATIONS, SGM POPULATIONS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY POOR HEALTH, INCLUDING DISPARITIES IN ALCOHOL USE, SUBSTANCE USE, AND MENTAL ILLNESS. SUBSTANTIAL PRIOR WORK HAS SUPPORTED THE MINORITY STRESS FRAMEWORK TO CONTEXTUALIZE SGM HEALTH DISPARITIES; STRESSORS RELATED TO DISCRIMINATION AND VICTIMIZATION TIED TO SGM STATUS ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH DISPARITIES. THE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY SUCH DISPARITIES AND POTENTIAL CAUSAL PATHWAYS IS VITAL TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE RESEARCH, POLICY, AND PRACTICE ARE APPROPRIATELY EQUIPPED TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS SUCH AS SGM INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE CASE OF ALCOHOL, WHICH REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED AND ABUSED DRUGS NATIONWIDE, PARTICULARLY AMONG BOTH ADOLESCENT AND ADULT SGM. HOWEVER, MEASUREMENT OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH SGM IDENTITY AND STIGMATIZATION \u2013 E.G., SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AND GENDER IDENTITY (SSOGI) \u2013 REMAINS POORLY DEFINED AND INCONSISTENTLY USED ACROSS HEALTH RESEARCH AND PRACTICE SETTINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, DESPITE EVIDENT LIMITATIONS, MOST STUDIES, PROVIDERS, AND NATIONAL SURVEYS CONTINUE TO USE A BINARY FRAMEWORK (MALE VS. FEMALE) TO ASSESS SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH. THIS APPROACH FAILS TO CAPTURE A SUBSTANTIAL POPULATION OF INTERSEX INDIVIDUALS (ESTIMATED PREVALENCE OF 1-2 PER 1,000 LIVE BIRTHS). FURTHER, MOST SURVEYS CONTINUE TO USE THE NON-RECOMMENDED PRACTICE OF CONFLATING SEX AND GENDER IDENTITY BY ASKING ABOUT ONLY ONE OF THESE CONSTRUCTS, THEREBY FAILING TO APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY OR CHARACTERIZE TRANSGENDER, NON-BINARY, AND GENDER NONCONFORMING INDIVIDUALS. WHILE A GROWING NUMBER OF SURVEYS ASK ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION, THEY FREQUENTLY DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR ITS MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE: MANY ITEMS CONFLATE IDENTITY (E.G., GAY, BISEXUAL), WITH BEHAVIOR (E.G., SEX WITH ONLY SAME-SEX PARTNERS) AND ATTRACTION (E.G., ONLY ATTRACTED TO MALE-PRESENTING INDIVIDUALS). THIS IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING AS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WOULD ONLY BE CLASSIFIED AS A SEXUAL MINORITY BASED ON ONE CATEGORY, BUT NOT ANOTHER (E.G., A PERSON WHO IDENTIFIES AS HETEROSEXUAL BUT HAS SEX WITH SAME-SEX PARTNERS). FURTHERMORE, CURRENT MEASURES OFTEN ARE NOT COMPREHENSIVE, EXCLUDE UNDERSTUDIED OR EMERGING ORIENTATIONS (E.G., ASEXUAL, PANSEXUAL, QUEER), LACK THE ABILITY TO SELECT MULTIPLE OPTIONS, AND FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN IDENTITY OVER TIME. WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE, VALIDATED MEASURES TO ASSESS SSOGI, THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE OF SGM DISPARITIES OR HOW BEST TO INTERVENE TO PROMOTE SGM HEALTH EQUITY IS LIMITED. THEREFORE, IT IS VITAL TO DEVELOP STANDARDIZED, FLEXIBLE MEASURES FOR USE ACROSS DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHICS AND REGIONS.

ALCOHOL-RELATED BRAIN DEFECTS AND ALCOHOL- ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROGRESSION OF AUD. ABOUT 50-80% OF PATIENTS WITH AUD HAVE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS. THESE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS PERSIST OVER YEARS AND GET WORSE WITH AGE. MOREOVER, ALCOHOL-RELATED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS MAY IMPACT AUD OUTCOMES BECAUSE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND MEMORY ARE NECESSARY FOR SELF-REGULATION AND LEARNING, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT DURING RECOVERY. THESE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS ARE ESPECIALLY PREVALENT IN THE EARLY PHASE OF RECOVERY AND REDUCE THE ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM CURRENT AUD TREATMENTS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT COGNITIVE REMEDIATION THERAPY (CRT) MAY IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND AUD TREATMENT OUTCOMES. THERE ARE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS DEMONSTRATING THAT CRT REDUCES ALCOHOL CRAVING OR DRINKING. HOWEVER, A FEW STUDIES ALSO REPORTED THAT CRT IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DRINKING. THUS, CRT MAY NEED TO BE AUGMENTED BY ANOTHER INTERVENTION (E.G., COGNITIVE-ENHANCING PHARMACOTHERAPY) TO INCREASE THE BENEFITS OF CRT. EMERGING NEUROBIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT AN ANTICHOLINESTERASE AGENT DONEPEZIL MAY TREAT AUD. DONEPEZIL IS CURRENTLY APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEMENTIA OF THE ALZHEIMER'S TYPE. SINCE DONEPEZIL HAS BEEN CLINICALLY USED AS A COGNITIVE ENHANCER, DONEPEZIL MAY TREAT AUD WHILE ENHANCING NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IN PATIENTS WITH AUD.

THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE AMONG US MILITARY PERSONNEL. WHILE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN THE US MILITARY IS VERY HIGH AND NORMATIVE, THERE IS ZERO TOLERANCE FOR GETTING IN LEGAL TROUBLE WHILE DRINKING, AND AIRMEN WHO DO GET IN ALCOHOL-RELATED LEGAL TROUBLE (E.G., DUI, SEXUAL ASSAULT) TYPICALLY RECEIVE WHAT IS CALLED AN ALCOHOL RELATED INCIDENT (ARI). IN OTHER POPULATIONS, BRIEF ALCOHOL INTERVENTIONS (BAIS) FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE HAVE BEEN VALIDATED AS EFFICACIOUS WITH ROBUST EVIDENCE FOR MOSTLY COLLEGE YOUNG ADULTS WHO REPORT EPISODIC HEAVY DRINKING. MANY BAI STUDIES HAVE TARGETED YOUNG ADULTS WHO DRINK HAZARDOUSLY; THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE GENERALLY NOT INTERESTED IN ABSTAINING FROM ALCOHOL, BUT ARE OFTEN WILLING TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT THEY DRINK OR CHANGE THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY DRINK IN ORDER TO REDUCE HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED1 THE RESULTS OF A BAI GROUP- BASED INTERVENTION THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE ARIS UNIVERSALLY (NOT IN JUST HIGH RISK DRINKERS) IN OVER 150,000 ON AVERAGE BY 16%. SINCE WE BEGAN IN 2010, THE BAI HAS BEEN DISSEMINATED TO MOST AIRMEN IN TECHNICAL (ADVANCED) TRAINING IN THE USAF. HOWEVER, IT IS CLEAR THAT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ENHANCE THE EFFICACY OF OUR BAI INTERVENTION AND TO REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PROBLEM DRINKING BEHAVIOR. ONE SUCH STRATEGY THAT COULD IMPROVE HEALTH PROMOTION OUTCOMES IS WELL TIMED AND TAILORED AUTOMATED TEXT MESSAGES. BUILDING ON OUR PRELIMINARY STUDY WHERE TEXT MESSAGES REDUCED DRIVING AFTER DRINKING AS WELL AS TOTAL DRINKS CONSUMED BEFORE DRIVING (SEE PREVIOUS WORK), TEXT MESSAGING MAY BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS THE PRECISE TIME THAT AIRMEN GAIN ACCESS TO ALCOHOL (WHEN THEY ARE ALLOWED OFF BASE FOR THE FIRST TIME) IS KNOWN AND IS THE SAME TIME FOR ALL AIRMEN.

CHRONIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION SEVERELY COMPROMISES LIVER MITOCHONDRIAL BIOENERGETIC FUNCTION; HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC MOLECULAR MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR MITOCHONDRIAL DAMAGE ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. WE ALSO DO NOT KNOW THE FULL CONTRIBUTION OF MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION IN PATHOBIOLOGY OF ALD. ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE CONCEPT THAT AN INTRINSIC BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM KNOWN AS THE MOLECULAR CIRCADIAN CLOCK REGULATES HOW ORGANS RESPOND TO EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL PHYSIOLOGICAL STIMULI AND ABNORMAL PATHOLOGIC STRESSES. THERE IS A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS ARE DISRUPTED BY CHRONIC ALCOHOL USE, WHICH LIKELY CONTRIBUTE TO DISEASE AS GENETIC MUTATION OR DELETION OF CLOCK GENES INCREASE METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION AND LIVER PATHOLOGY IN ALCOHOL MODELS. REGARDING THIS SCIENTIFIC PREMISE, WE DISCOVERED THAT CHRONIC ALCOHOL SIGNIFICANTLY DECEASES LIVER CLOCK AMPLITUDE AND DISRUPTS THE TIMING OF THE LIVER CLOCK. ALCOHOL-FED MICE WITH LIVER-SPECIFIC DELETION OF BMAL1 EXHIBIT IMPAIRED GLUCOSE AND GLYCOGEN METABOLISM RHYTHMS, A DYSREGULATED HEPATIC TRIGLYCERIDE LIPIDOME, AND A GREATER LIVER DISEASE PATHOLOGY SCORE COMPARED TO CONTROL GENOTYPE MICE FED AN ALCOHOL DIET.

ALCOHOL ABUSE AND SMOKING ARE COMMON CAUSES OF CP BUT THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THEIR TOXIC EFFECTS ON THE PANCREAS ARE UNCLEAR. RECENTLY, ADAPTIVE MECHANISMS THAT PREVENT PANCREATITIS WITH STRESSORS SUCH AS ALCOHOL WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE PANCREATIC ACINAR CELL. THESE ADAPTIVE MECHANISMS INVOLVE THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE (UPR) AND THE UPR TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, X-BOX BINDING PROTEIN 1 (XBP1S) THAT UPREGULATES ER CHAPERONES, ER TRANSPORTERS, AND QUALITY CONTROL MACHINERY TO MAINTAIN ER FUNCTION. OUR PREVIOUS WORK SHOWED THAT ALCOHOL ADMINISTRATION INDUCES OXIDATIVE STRESS BUT ALSO UPREGULATES XBP1S AND A PROTECTIVE UPR THAT PREVENTS PATHOLOGY, WHILE SMOKING INHIBITS ALCOHOL INDUCED XBP1S FORMATION, AND UPREGULATES A PATHOLOGIC UPR SIGNAL MEDIATED BY C/EBP HOMOLOGOUS PROTEIN (CHOP) RESULTING IN ER DYSFUNCTION AND PANCREATITIS. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS OF PANCREATITIS ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL ABUSE, SMOKING AND PERTURBED ER PROTEIN FOLDING AND TRAFFICKING. REVERSIBLE NE-LYSINE ACETYLATION REGULATES THE EFFICIENCY OF ER PROTEIN TRANSIT TO GOLGI AND THE SECRETORY PATHWAY. ACETYLATION OF PROPERLY FOLDED PROTEINS ENABLES ER-TO-GOLGI EXIT, WHILE NON- ACETYLATED, MISFOLDED PROTEINS DIVERT TO PROTEIN DEGRADATION SYSTEMS. THUS, DISRUPTION OF ER PROTEIN ACETYLATION PERTURBS ER FUNCTION AND PROTEIN TRAFFICKING. THE ACETYL COA TRANSPORTER, AT-1 MEDIATES ER ENTRY OF ACETYL COA FROM CYTOPLASM TO PROVIDE SUBSTRATE FOR ACETYLATION. IN HUMANS, THE AT-1-S113R MUTANT REDUCES AT-1 TRANSPORT CAPACITY, AND INDIVIDUALS WITH THIS MUTANT EXHIBIT NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS. WE FOUND THAT XBP1S REGULATES AT-1 LEVELS IN ACINAR CELLS. MOREOVER, AT-1S113R/+ OR ACINAR-SPECIFIC AT-1 DEFICIENT MICE DEVELOP MILD/ MODERATE CP AND CHRONIC ER STRESS WITH ELEVATED XBP1S. STRIKINGLY, AP INDUCTION IN THESE MICE DECREASES XBP1S LEVELS AND MARKEDLY EXACERBATES CP PROGRESSION. OUR RESULTS INDICATE AT-1 AND XBP1S ARE INTERDEPENDENT AND IMPORTANT FOR PANCREAS ADAPTION IN RESPONSE TO ALCOHOL BUT WHEN OVERWHELMED BY ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS THESE ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS FAIL LEADING TO PATHOLOGY.

IN PERSONS WITH NORMAL ALCOHOL METABOLISM, DIFFERENCES IN LEVEL OF RESPONSE TO AN ACUTE INTOXICATING DOSE OF ALCOHOL RESULT MAINLY FROM DIFFERENCES IN ACUTE TOLERANCE TO ALCOHOL. TOLERANCE HAS A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION; TOLERANCE TO ALCOHOL\u2019S REWARDING EFFECTS ENCOURAGES MORE DRINKING TO ACHIEVE A DESIRED EFFECT, WHEREAS TOLERANCE TO ALCOHOL\u2019S AVERSIVE PROPERTIES REDUCES A DISINCENTIVE TO DRINK. THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON RECENT FINDINGS THAT INHIBITORS OF PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4 (PDE4) REDUCE ALCOHOL DRINKING IN RODENTS. IN OUR WORK WITH THE PDE4 INHIBITOR APREMILAST, WE WERE STRUCK BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ITS ABILITY TO REDUCE BOTH ALCOHOL TOLERANCE AND ETHANOL CONSUMPTION. INHIBITORS OF PDE4 REDUCE METABOLISM OF CAMP WHICH LEADS TO ACTIVATION OF PROTEIN KINASE A (PKA). ALCOHOL HAS PROMINENT EFFECTS ON GABAA RECEPTORS, AND IT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS THAT PKA ALTERS THE FUNCTION OF GABAA RECEPTORS THROUGH PHOSPHORYLATION OF SS1 AND SS3 RECEPTOR SUBUNITS. OUR PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS LED US TO OUR OVERALL HYPOTHESIS THAT PDE4 INHIBITION REDUCES ALCOHOL TOLERANCE AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION BY INCREASING GABAA RECEPTOR FUNCTION IN THE BRAIN THROUGH PKA-MEDIATED PHOSPHORYLATION OF GABAA RECEPTOR SS3 SUBUNITS, WITH PKA-MEDIATED PHOSPHORYLATION OF SS1 SUBUNITS CONTRIBUTING A MINOR OPPOSITE EFFECT.

TO STUDY THESE EFFECTS, WE PRESENT THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESIS: ALCOHOL-INDUCED INCREASE IN SERUM GHRELIN LEVELS DIRECTLY (I) INHIBITS GLP-1 HORMONE-MEDIATED ENERGY METABOLISM IN HEPATOCYTES AND (II) MODULATES ADIPOSE METABOLISM TO INCREASE ADIPOSE LIPOLYSIS AND DECREASE ADIPONECTIN SECRETION, BOTH OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO HEPATIC STEATOSIS. FURTHERMORE, GHRELIN ALSO ENHANCES ITS EFFECTS BY LOWERING THE LEVELS OF LEAP-2, RECENTLY DISCOVERED ENDOGENOUS GHRELIN ANTAGONIST PEPTIDE THAT REDUCES THE GHRELIN RECEPTOR (GHS-R) MEDIATED SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION. WE WILL UTILIZE A VARIETY OF STATE-OF-THE ART TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATIVE BIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS TO EXPLORE OUR HYPOTHESIS IN THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) CHARACTERIZE THE ROLE OF GHRELIN IN MODULATING THE GUT-DERIVED GLP-1 HORMONE-MEDIATED GUT-LIVER CROSSTALK DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFLD; 2) CHARACTERIZE THE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTION OF GHRELIN IN MODULATING THE ADIPOSE-LIVER AXIS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALFD; AND 3) EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF ALCOHOL- INDUCED GHRELIN INCREASE ON LEAP-2 EXPRESSION AND CHARACTERIZE ITS ROLE IN MODULATING HEPATIC STEATOSIS.

BUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRANSDERMAL ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION (TAC) AND BLOOD ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION (BAC) IS HIGHLY COMPLEX, VARYING ACROSS INDIVIDUALS AND CONTEXTS AND INVOLVING SOME DEGREE OF LAG TIME. PRIOR RESEARCH, WHICH HAS FEATURED EXTREMELY SMALL PARTICIPANT SAMPLES AND EXAMINED OLD-GENERATION TRANSDERMAL DEVICES, HAS BEEN POORLY SUITED TO MODELING THIS COMPLEXITY. THUS, SCIENTISTS ARE LEFT WITH LITTLE SENSE FOR HOW TO TRANSLATE DATA PRODUCED BY TRANSDERMAL SENSORS INTO ESTIMATES OF BAC. IMPORTANTLY, THE PAST DECADE HAS SEEN REMARKABLE TECHNOLOGICAL AND ANALYTIC DEVELOPMENTS, OFFERING THE POTENTIAL TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGE OF TAC-BAC TRANSLATION. IN PARTICULAR, IN RECENT YEARS, MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT ARE PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED TO MODELING HIGHLY COMPLEX AND TIME-LAGGED RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN LARGER DATASETS.

FASD IS THE MOST PREVENTABLE NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER, YET THE PREVALENCE IS STILL HIGH WHICH IS AT LEAST 2-5% IN THE US AND THE WORLD. THEREFORE, DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL FOR FASD RESEARCH.  PERSISTENT SYNAPTIC DYSFUNCTIONS INCLUDING IMMATURE SYNAPSES ARE CRITICAL CELLULAR MECHANISMS MEDIATING COGNITIVE/BEHAVIORAL DEFICITS IN FASD.

BOTH MICROGLIA AND ECB SIGNALING PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE MATURATION, MAINTENANCE, AND REGULATION OF SYNAPTIC FUNCTIONS IN THE BRAIN. FURTHERMORE, INCREASED ECB RELEASE FROM ACTIVATED MICROGLIA HAS BEEN REPORTED TO COUNTER NEUROINFLAMMATION. WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT REDUCING MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH NORMALIZED ECB SIGNALING, SYNAPTIC FUNCTIONS, AND BEHAVIORS IN PE ANIMALS.

THE RESULTS OF THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL LEAD TO IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDING IN THE CELLULAR MECHANISMS MEDIATING THE PERSISTENT CELLULAR AND COGNITIVE/BEHAVIORAL DEFICITS OF PE.

SINCE WM INTEGRITY IS CRITICAL TO MANY CNS FUNCTIONS, BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ETHANOL EXERTS ITS ADVERSE EFFECTS ON WM IS NEEDED TO PREVENT OR REMEDIATE THE ASSOCIATED NEUROBEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS. OLIGODENDROCYTE DYSFUNCTION IS AT THE CORE OF WM DEGENERATION SINCE OLIGODENDROGLIA ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SYNTHESIZING AND MAINTAINING MYELIN. MYELIN IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT AND PROTECT AXONS AND ENSURE EFFICIENT NEURONAL CONDUCTIVITY.

HOWEVER, INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL PREVENTION STRATEGIES FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS TEND TO FOCUS ON STUDENTS\u2019 ALCOHOL USE PATTERNS AND CONSEQUENCES MORE BROADLY, WITH LITTLE TO NO INTEGRATION OF CONTENT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALCOHOL USE AND RSB, AN IMPORTANT GAP IN THE LITERATURE AND A PRIORITY AREA FOR NIAAA. OUR TEAM PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED THE SHORT-TERM EFFICACY OF A PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK INTERVENTION (PFI), A GOLD STANDARD INTERVENTION APPROACH, WITH INTEGRATED CONTENT ON ALCOHOL AND RSB. WE PROPOSE TO EXTEND OUR INTEGRATED PFI TO INCLUDE A CROSS-TAILORED DYNAMIC FEEDBACK (CDF) COMPONENT, WHICH LEVERAGES TECHNOLOGY TO INCORPORATE DAILY ASSESSMENTS OF STUDENT BEHAVIOR AND PROVIDE USERS WITH DYNAMIC WEEKLY FEEDBACK OVER 12 WEEKS TO AMPLIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTEGRATED PFI AND TO BE EASILY IMPLEMENTED ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. THE PROJECT UTILIZES A MULTISITE, HYBRID TYPE 1 EFFECTIVENESS-IMPLEMENTATION STUDY DESIGN TO (1) EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF CDF FOR AT-RISK FIRST-YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND (2) IDENTIFY IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS CRITICAL TO ITS SUCCESS TO FACILITATE FUTURE SCALE-UP IN CAMPUS SETTINGS. THE FIRST AIM IS TO CONDUCT A MULTI-LEVEL STAKEHOLDER-ENGAGED ADAPTATION OF THE INTEGRATED ALCOHOL AND RISKY SEX PFI THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND INCLUSION OF CDF. THE SECOND AIM IS TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF THE ENHANCED INTERVENTION (PFI+CDF) IN A SAMPLE OF 600 FIRST- YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO REPORT RECENT BINGE DRINKING AND ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE. OUR PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVE THE PFI+CDF INTERVENTION WILL REPORT LESS ALCOHOL USE, FEWER RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIORS, AND FEWER CONSEQUENCES RELATIVE TO THOSE WHO RECEIVE A PFI SUPPLEMENTED WITH GENERIC HEALTH INFORMATION AT FOLLOW- UP (1, 2, 3, 6, AND 13 MONTHS). OUR THIRD AIM SEEKS TO IDENTIFY FACTORS CRITICAL TO PFI+CDF IMPLEMENTATION IN CAMPUS SETTINGS THROUGH CONDUCTING FOCUS GROUPS WITH A SUBSET OF STUDENTS FROM THE RCT AND WITH LOCAL AND NATIONAL SYSTEMS-LEVEL STAKEHOLDERS.

FASD AFFECTS AN ESTIMATED 40,000 INFANTS IN THE US EACH YEAR, WITH 2-5% OF YOUNGER SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN HAVING FASD. CURRENTLY, PREDICTION OF FASD DURING PREGNANCY IS NOT AVAILABLE, AND THERE ARE NO READILY AVAILABLE CURES AGAINST FASD. IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT EARLY DETECTION OF FASD AND ITS SUBSEQUENT INTERVENTION STRATEGIES ARE CRITICAL TO ALLOW EARLIEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS. WHILE FETAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE TARGETS MULTIPLE ORGANS AND SYSTEMS, THE BRAIN CONSTITUTES THE MOST SEVERELY AFFECTED ORGAN, EXHIBITING BOTH STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITIES. AS NEURONAL DEVELOPMENT CRITICALLY DEPENDS ON THE OXYGEN DELIVERY, NUTRITIONAL SUPPLY AND WASTE REMOVAL BY CEREBRAL CIRCULATION, RECENT STUDIES HAVE BEEN PAYING INCREASING ATTENTION TO THE FETAL CEREBRAL CIRCULATION AS A CRITICAL TARGET OF MATERNAL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. HOWEVER, THE TIMING AND MECHANISMS THAT GOVERN FETAL CEREBROVASCULAR RESPONSE TO ALCOHOL REMAIN ELUSIVE. ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES THAT PRECLUDE RAPID ADVANCEMENT OF THE STUDIES ON FETAL CEREBRAL CIRCULATION IS LACK OF HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING TECHNIQUE THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR IMAGING OF SMALL LAB ANIMAL SPECIES.

ANOTHER OBSTACLE TO DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS TO ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS AND DEVELOP PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST FASD IS A RELATIVELY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE ON RELEVANT TARGETS FOR ALCOHOL, INCLUDING TARGETS WITHIN FETAL CEREBRAL ARTERIES. IN THIS REGARD, CURRENT PROPOSAL WILL FOCUS ON CEREBRAL ARTERY MITOCHONDRIA. CRITICAL ROLE OF MITOCHONDRIA IN REGULATING CEREBRAL ARTERY FUNCTION IS WELL DOCUMENTED, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MITOCHONDRIAL IS ONE OF THE MAJOR SENSORS FOR ALCOHOL AS SHOWN IN LIVER AND NEURONS.

IT IS THUS CRITICAL FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE THAT WE GAIN A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIQUE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO ALCOHOL USE BEHAVIORS IN AFRICAN AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS.

YET, THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH THESE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AFFECT ALCOHOL USE BEHAVIORS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD, RESULTING IN AN ABSENCE OF VITAL INFORMATION NEEDED TO ENHANCE ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS (AUD) PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES. WE HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN THAT EXPOSURE TO A COMMON STRESSOR, STEREOTYPE THREAT, IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN IMPULSIVITY \u2013 A KEY MEDIATING MECHANISM OF AUD RISK. STEREOTYPE THREAT (ST) IS A BEHAVIORAL PHENOMENON THAT ARISES WHEN CUES IN THE ENVIRONMENT EVOKE NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES ASSOCIATED WITH AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S GROUP, TRIGGERING COGNITIVE PROCESSES THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT BEHAVIOR. AN ENDURING STEREOTYPE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IS THAT THEY EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF ALCOHOL/SUBSTANCE USE. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT EXPOSURE TO THESE NEGATIVE RACE-RELATED STEREOTYPES ELEVATES IMPULSIVITY. FURTHER, OUR DATA REVEAL THAT THIS INCREASE IN IMPULSIVITY CORRELATES WITH ALCOHOL USE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS. THESE FINDINGS REVEAL ST-INDUCED IMPULSIVITY AS A NOVEL CORRELATE OF AUD-RISK BEHAVIORS. IN LINE WITH NIAAA\u2019S GOAL TO DEVELOP A MORE THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTING TO AUD RISK, WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE NEURAL MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH ST-INDUCED IMPULSIVITY.

THE BED NUCLEUS OF THE STRIA TERMINALIS (BNST) IS A SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC BRAIN REGION AND CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT-ASSOCIATED RELAPSE IN AUDS, AND THEREFORE IS A PRIME TARGET FOR THIS MALADAPTIVE PLASTICITY. USING A MODEL OF ADOLESCENT INTERMITTENT ETHANOL EXPOSURE (AIE) IN MALE AND FEMALE MICE, WE FIND DISRUPTED BNST GLUTAMATERGIC TRANSMISSION AND PLASTICITY, BUT THE MECHANISMS DIFFER ACROSS SEX (GLUN2B- NMDAR-MEDIATED IN MALES AND MGLUR1/5-MEDIATED IN FEMALES). WHEN TESTED DURING ADULTHOOD, BOTH FORMS OF BNST PLASTICITY RETURN TO CONTROL LEVELS BUT EXPOSURE TO RESTRAINT STRESS PRODUCED A RE-EMERGENCE OF AIE-INDUCED THAT WERE SEX-SPECIFIC. AIE ALSO INCREASED GLUTAMATE RELEASE IN THE BNST AND THIS EFFECT APPEARS BE MITIGATED THROUGH MODULATION OF PRESYNAPTIC CRFR1. AIE AND ADULT STRESS ALSO PRODUCE SEX-SPECIFIC NEGATIVE AFFECT BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPES (NOVELTY-INDUCED HYPOPHAGIA TEST IN FEMALES, FOOT SHOCK-INDUCE FREEZING IN MALES). AS THE BNST SITS AT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN CORTICAL INPUTS AND DOWNSTREAM AMYGDALAR AND HYPOTHALAMIC TARGETS, THIS ENHANCED DRIVE TO THE BNST AND SUBSEQUENT INTER BNST PLASTICITY LIKELY SENSITIZE THE STRESS RESPONSE AND THE EXPRESSION OF NEGATIVE AFFECT BEHAVIORS. USING A COMBINATION OF MOLECULAR, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL, GENETIC, AND BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES, WE WILL EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF AIE TO PRIME THE BNST TO ADULT STRESS SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT THAT AIE AND ADULT STRESS ACT TO SYNERGISTICALLY ENHANCE GLUTAMATE RELEASE IN THE BNST VIA ACTIVATION OF CRFR1 IN MALE MICE BUT NOT FEMALE MICE (AIM 1). MODULATION OF CRFR1 TRANSMISSION WILL BE EXAMINED FOR ITS ABILITY TO BLOCK THE EFFECTS OF STRESS ON GLUTAMATE RELEASE AND PLASTICITY AND EVALUATE STRESS SENSITIVE INPUTS. NEXT, I PROPOSE THAT THE SEX DIFFERENCE IN BNST PLASTICITY OCCUR IN DISTINCT PROJECTION REGIONS (CEA, LH, OR VTA).

SUCCESSFULLY TREATED POPULATION OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV)-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS AGE, COGNITIVE AND HEALTH CHALLENGES OF NORMAL AGING ENSUE, BURDENED BY HIV, TREATMENT SIDE EFFECTS, AND HIGH PREVALENCE COMORBIDITIES, NOTABLY, ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (ALC) AND HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV). THE AGING BRAIN IS INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO ENDOGENOUS AND EXOGENOUS INSULT WHICH, COUPLED WITH HIV INFECTION, CAN LEAD TO HIV-ASSOCIATED NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER (HAND) AND SENSORIMOTOR DISTURBANCES.  OUR GOAL IS TO EXPLICATE THE ROLE OF AGING IN MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MR)-DETECTABLE HIV PATHOLOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF COMMON COMORBIDITIES (ALC, HCV), WHILE CONSIDERING HIV-RELEVANT VARIABLES (NUTRITION, MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND TOXICITY, LIVER INTEGRITY). AS COMMON HIV-ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES OF ALC AND HCV MAY INTENSIFY INFLAMMATORY CASCADES AND POTENTIATE HIV PATHOLOGY, A COROLLARY AIM IS TO CONSIDER WHETHER CIRCULATING MARKERS OF INFLAMMATION (MICROBIAL DISLOCATION, MONOCYTE-RELATED IMMUNE ACTIVATION, PERIPHERAL CYTOKINE ELEVATIONS) CORROBORATE PROPOSED IMAGING MARKERS OF NEUROINFLAMMATION.  WE WILL FOLLOW 140 PARTICIPANTS FROM OUR EXISTING COHORT AND RECRUIT 100 NEW SUBJECTS, WITH A FOCUS ON OLDER HIV-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS, USING MR METRICS CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONGITUDINAL DATABASE. IN KEEPING WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RFA, WE PROPOSE FOUR SPECIFIC AIMS:  1. INVESTIGATE THE CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL PATTERN OF BRAIN AND COGNITIVE CHANGES IN TERMS OF  DISEASE AND AGE TRAJECTORIES USING QUANTITATIVE MR IMAGING AND NEUROCOGNITIVE MEASURES.  2. IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT MODIFY HIV DISEASE TRAJECTORY, INCLUDING AGE, SEX, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, HCV  AND ITS TREATMENT, NUTRITION, MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND TOXICITY, AND HEPATIC INTEGRITY. EXPLORATORY  FACTORS INCLUDE MEASURES OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, SLEEP QUALITY, AND IMPULSIVITY.  3. ESTABLISH EVIDENCE FOR NEUROINFLAMMATORY MARKERS USING FREE WATER DTI AND BRAIN METABOLITES  QUANTIFIED BY MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY.  4. QUANTIFY THE EXTENT OF POSTURAL INSTABILITY AND TRUNCAL TREMOR IN RELATION TO COMORBID FACTORS AND  NORMAL OR ACCELERATED AGING.  ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THESE AIMS WILL ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO AGE AND DISEASE- RELATED COGNITIVE DECLINE, SENSORIMOTOR PROBLEMS, AND NEURODEGENERATION. CONVERGENT EVIDENCE FROM BLOOD BIOMARKERS (ELEVATIONS IN MICROBIAL DISLOCATION, MONOCYTE ACTIVATION, AND PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES), MRS METABOLITES [MYO-INOSITOL (MI), CHOLINE-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS (CHO), MACROMOLECULES (MM09+LIP09] AND GLUTATHIONE (GSH)], AND DTI METRICS (FREE WATER) MAY PROVIDE INITIAL SUPPORT FOR A CONSTELLATION OF IN VIVO MARKERS OF NEUROINFLAMMATION.", "Place of Performance

PRECLINICAL STUDIES HAVE BEGUN TO IDENTIFY NEUROCIRCUITS AND PEPTIDE TARGETS THAT REGULATE NEGATIVE AFFECT DURING ABSTINENCE. AS THE FIELD HAS BEGUN TO DEVELOP A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CIRCUITRIES PARTICIPATING IN ADDICTION AND NEGATIVE AFFECT, THE NEXT STEP IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW COMMUNICATION WITHIN THESE CIRCUITS IS MODULATED PARTICULARLY AT THE NEUROPEPTIDE AND MICROCIRCUIT LEVEL. THE BED NUCLEUS OF THE STRIA TERMINALIS (BNST) IS A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF ABSTINENCE-RELEVANT NEUROCIRCUITRY AS IT MODULATES STRESS AND ALCOHOL-RELATED BEHAVIOR IN A NEUROPEPTIDE-DEPENDENT MANNER. TO INVESTIGATE PEPTIDE-SPECIFIC BNST CIRCUITRY MODULATING NEGATIVE-AFFECT DURING ABSTINENCE, WE WILL FOCUS ON AFFERENTS FROM THE PARABRACHIAL NUCLEUS (PBN), A BRAINSTEM REGION THAT FUNCTIONS AS A DANGER SIGNAL. PBN PROJECTIONS TO THE BNST RELEASE CALCITONIN GENE- RELATED PEPTIDE (CGRP) AND PITUITARY ADENYLATE CYCLASE ACTIVATING POLYPEPTIDE (PACAP), PEPTIDES THAT MODULATE PAIN AND FEAR CIRCUITS, RESPECTIVELY. OUR STUDIES IMPLICATE HETEROGENOUS AND SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC CONTROL WITHIN THE PBNABNST CIRCUIT AS PBN PROJECTIONS INDUCE HETEROGENEOUS EX VIVO ACTIVITY IN BNST CELLS AND FEMALE-SPECIFIC ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR WITH BNSTPBN ACTIVATION. FURTHERMORE, OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST A ROLE FOR THE PBN IN ALCOHOL-WITHDRAWAL, AS INACTIVATION IS ANXIOLYTIC FOLLOWING ALCOHOL EXPOSURE.

EMERGING ADULTS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS, SUICIDAL IDEATION, AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS COMPARED TO ANY OTHER AGE GROUP. THESE PROBLEMS ARE HIGHLY COMORBID, WITH ALCOHOL INTOXICATION SERVING AS A RISK FACTOR FOR SUICIDALITY. HOWEVER, UTILIZATION OF OUTPATIENT TREATMENT SERVICES FOR ALCOHOL OR MENTAL HEALTH IS EXTREMELY LOW IN THIS POPULATION, EVEN FOLLOWING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS FOR EITHER PROBLEM. EMERGING ADULTS ARE LIKELY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO MHEALTH INTERVENTIONS, AND MHEALTH IS WELL-SUITED TO THE ED. MHEALTH CAN ADDRESS AN URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH NEED BY BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN DISCHARGE AND ACCESS TO OUTPATIENT CARE AND BY SUPPORTING EMERGING ADULTS WHO DO NOT ACCESS OUTPATIENT CARE. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO DESIGN AN EVIDENCE-INFORMED INTERACTIVE, AVATAR-GUIDED MHEALTH INTERVENTION TO PROVIDE ONGOING EDUCATION, SKILLS PRACTICE, MOOD AND BEHAVIOR MONITORING, AND PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK TO REDUCE ALCOHOL MISUSE AND SUICIDALITY.

A 3-YEAR PROGRAM OF INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT AFTER SUCCESSFUL RECRUITMENT AS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR POSITION IS ALSO OUTLINED. THE CANDIDATE\u2019S MENTOR HAS A PROVEN TRACK-RECORD OF EXCELLENT SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESSFUL MENTORSHIP AND CAN PROVIDE THE CANDIDATE WITH A SOLID RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT IN HER LAB. RESEARCH PLAN: ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED LIVER DISEASE (ALD) REMAINS A MAJOR SOCIOECONOMIC BURDEN WITH HIGH MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. ACTIVATION OF INNATE IMMUNITY NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO PROGRESSION OF ALD, BUT IS ALSO CRITICAL FOR RESOLUTION OF INJURY. APPROPRIATE REGULATION OF PRO-SURVIVAL AND PRO-DEATH PATHWAYS IS CRITICAL TO THE ABILITY OF INNATE IMMUNE CELLS TO RAPIDLY RESPOND TO MAINTAIN LIVER HOMEOSTASIS IN ETHANOL-INDUCED INJURY. MLKL-MEDIATED NECROPTOSIS PLAYS A DUAL ROLE IN TISSUE INJURY/REPAIR. WHETHER MLKL-MEDIATED NECROPTOSIS OF IMMUNE CELLS IS BENEFICIAL OR DETRIMENTAL IN THE CONTEXT OF ETHANOL IS UNKNOWN.

TOGETHER, THESE DATA LED US TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT MYELOID CELL-SPECIFIC MLKL RESTRICTS ETHANOL- INDUCED INJURY BY REGULATING HEPATIC IMMUNE CELL SURVIVAL AND DEATH. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, HEPATIC IMMUNE CELL POPULATIONS AND DEATH WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF ISOLATED NPCS FROM LIVERS OF MLKL BM CHIMERAS AFTER GAO-BINGE.

ONE FIFTH OF MID-LIFE ADULTS REPORTED BINGE DRINKING AND MORE THAN HALF REPORTED HAVING HYPERTENSION. HOWEVER, THIS AGE GROUP HAS BEEN UNDERSTUDIED IN ALCOHOL RESEARCH. IN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS (18-30 YEARS) WITH NORMAL SBP, THE CANDIDATE HAS FOUND THAT REPEATED BINGE DRINKING IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED MICROVASCULAR FUNCTION, MEASURED AS FLOW-INDUCED VASODILATION (FIV) IN SMALL RESISTANCE ARTERIES. THE CANDIDATE HAS ALSO FOUND THAT REPEATED BINGE DRINKING IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LEVELS OF URINARY NOREPINEPHRINE, A VASOCONSTRICTOR AND A MARKER OF SYMPATHETIC NERVE ACTIVITY. IN A LATER MID-LIFE STAGE, THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF REPEATED BINGE DRINKING AND AGING MAY AGGRAVATE THESE ADVERSE CHANGES IN FIV AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY, CAUSING ELEVATED SBP. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF REPEATED BINGE DRINKING ON MICROVASCULAR FUNCTION, SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN MID-LIFE ADULTS AND THE REVERSIBILITY OF THESE ADVERSE CHANGES. AIM 1 WILL DETERMINE THE ROLE OF NOREPINEPHRINE AS A POTENTIAL MODERATOR OF REDUCED ARTERIOLAR FIV ASSOCIATED WITH REPEATED BINGE DRINKING. FIV WILL BE MEASURED IN RESISTANCE ARTERIES, THE MAJOR REGULATORY SITE OF SBP, ISOLATED FROM FAT BIOPSIES OF MID- LIFE ADULT BINGE DRINKERS VS. ALCOHOL ABSTAINERS/MODERATE DRINKERS. AIM 2 WILL DETERMINE SYMPATHETIC NERVE ACTIVITY (DIRECTLY VIA MICRONEUROGRAPHY) AND SBP (RESTING AND AMBULATORY) IN MID-LIFE ADULT BINGE DRINKERS VS. ALCOHOL ABSTAINERS/MODERATE DRINKERS. THE FINDINGS OF THIS APPROACH WILL POTENTIALLY ESTABLISH THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR ALCOHOL-ATTRIBUTABLE CONTRIBUTION TO ELEVATED SBP AND HAVE BROADER IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING HYPERTENSION DEVELOPMENT IN MID-LIFE ADULTS. THE FINDINGS WILL ALSO LAUNCH THE R00 PHASE OF INDEPENDENT RESEARCH WHERE IN AIM 3 THE CANDIDATE WILL INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HIGH-INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING ON IMPROVING FIV AND REDUCING SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY, THEREBY REDUCING SBP IN MID-LIFE ADULT BINGE DRINKERS. THE CLINICAL AND MECHANISTIC DATA WILL BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR AN R01 STUDYING THE MECHANISMS OF ALCOHOL INDUCED ELEVATED SBP, AND AN INTERVENTION FOCUSING ON MICROVASCULAR FUNCTION AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY.

THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT BINGE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION CAN LEAD TO LIFE-THREATENING ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS (2,3). WE HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN THAT BINGE ALCOHOL DRINKING IN A MOUSE MODEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTIVATION OF CANNABINOID RECEPTOR TYPE-1 (CB1) SIGNALING BY ENDOCANNABINOIDS, WHICH PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BINGE ALCOHOL INTOXICATION-INDUCED CARDIOVASCULAR DYSFUNCTION. (PALOCZI ET AL., ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION, J AM COLL CARDIOL BASIC TRANS SCIENCE).

OF THE PATTERNS OF EXCESSIVE INTAKE, BINGE DRINKING IS THE MOST COMMON AND ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE DEATHS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALCOHOL. IN ADDITION TO HIGH RATES OF MORTALITY, REPEATED CYCLES OF BINGE ALCOHOL INTAKE AND WITHDRAWAL CAUSE PERSISTENT ADAPTATIONS IN BRAIN REGIONS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AND SUBSEQUENT EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION.

RESEARCH PLAN: ALD IS A SPECTRUM OF DISORDERS THAT AFFECT A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS (AH) IS A SEVERE INFLAMMATORY DISEASE THAT CAN INCREASE THE MORBIDITY AND SEVERITY OF ALD DISORDERS. IN AH, THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS HYPERSENSITIVE TO MICROBIAL BYPRODUCTS. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION CAUSES GUT-BARRIER DISRUPTION, LEADING TO LEAKAGE OF GUT MICROBES INTO THE PORTAL CIRCULATION. THE LIVER IMMUNE SYSTEM IS ABLE TO DETECT THESE MICROBES THROUGH PATTERN RECOGNITION RECEPTORS, INCLUDING THE TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS (TLRS) AND C-TYPE LECTIN RECEPTORS (CTLS). WHILE TLRS HAVE BEEN WELL STUDIED FOR THEIR ROLE IN SENSITIZING THE INNATE IMMUNE CELLS TO MICROBIAL PRODUCTS, THE CTLS HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEEN IMPLICATED IN MOUSE MODELS OF ALD. CTLS ARE A LARGE FAMILY OF PRRS THAT SENSE A VAST DIVERSITY OF MICROBES, INCLUDING BACTERIA, FUNGI, AND VIRUSES. OUR WORK HAS FOUND THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THE CTL GENE FAMILY ARE UPREGULATED IN THE LIVER AND PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS PBMCS OF AH PATIENTS. CTLS WERE ALSO UPREGULATED IN PBMCS IN RESPONSE TO LPS/TLR4 SIGNALING. WE PREDICT CTLS ARE UPREGULATED IN RESPONSE TO GUT- DERIVED LPS IN ORDER TO INCREASE SENSING FOR OTHER MICROBES THAT MAY BE PRESENT IN THE BLOOD, MAKING THIS PATHWAY A SECONDARY INNATE IMMUNE SURVEILLANCE PATHWAY. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS IN THREE AIMS TO ADDRESS THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE AND REGULATION OF THIS IMMUNE SURVEILLANCE PATHWAY, AND THE MECHANISM BY WHICH IT IS EXACERBATED IN AH. FIRST, WE WILL USE PBMCS ISOLATED FROM AH PATIENTS TO MEASURE INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO CTL AGONISTS, AS WELL AS MICRO-/MYCOBIOME SEQUENCING TO DETERMINE WHAT MICROBIAL BYPRODUCTS WERE IN CIRCULATION IN PATIENTS. SECOND, WE WILL USE SINGLE-CELL RNA SEQUENCING (SCRNA-SEQ) TO DISSECT THE DIFFERENT MONOCYTE SUBCLASSES, VARIATION IN CTL EXPRESSION, AND HOW DIFFERENT CELL TYPES RESPOND TO CTL AGONISTS. THIRD, BECAUSE CTL GENES ARE CLUSTERED IN THE GENOME, WE WILL USE SCRNA-SEQ AND ATAC-SEQ (ASSAY FOR TRANSPOSASE-ACCESSIBLE CHROMATIN) TO UNDERSTAND CO-REGULATION OF NEARBY GENES IN THE GENOME.

PFC PV-INS EXPRESS SEVERAL DRUGGABLE RECEPTORS, NOTABLY INCLUDING METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE (MGLU) RECEPTOR SUBTYPES 1 AND 5. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT MGLU1 AND MGLU5 MODULATE PV-INS IN A SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER, AND FURTHER, THAT INTERMITTENT VOLUNTARY DRINKING INDUCES SEX-SPECIFIC ALTERATIONS TO SEVERAL MGLU1- AND MGLU5-RELATED PV-IN PHYSIOLOGY. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT SEX DIFFERENCES IN PFC PV-IN FUNCTION UNDERLIE AUD- RELATED PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND THAT MODULATING MGLU1 AND MGLU5 CAN AMELIORATE MALADAPTIVE CHANGES INDUCED BY BINGE-LIKE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION.

THE NEUROPEPTIDE OXYTOCIN (OT) IS ANTI-STRESS, AND SYSTEMIC ADMINISTRATION OF OT DECREASES WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND DRINKING IN ALCOHOLICS. THE CENTRAL AMYGDALA (CEA) AND BED NUCLEUS OF THE STRIA TERMINALIS (BNST) ARE TWO BRAIN REGIONS CONSIDERED TO BE HUBS FOR STRESS PROCESSING, AND THE ROLE OF PRO- AND ANTI-STRESS NEUROPEPTIDES IN THESE BRAIN REGIONS ARE CRITICAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE. SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY IN THE CEA AND BNST IS SENSITIVE TO ACUTE ALCOHOL, AND PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF ETHANOL CONSUMPTION. THE CEA AND BNST ARE RICH IN NEUROPEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS, INCLUDING CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING FACTOR (CRF) AND OT, AND ETHANOL\u2019S EFFECTS ON SYNAPTIC SIGNALING IN THESE REGIONS MAY BE MODULATED BY NEUROPEPTIDE ACTIVITY. CRF IS INVOLVED IN THE HEIGHTENED STRESS AND ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL, AND BLOCKING CRF ACTIVITY IN THE CEA AND BNST CAN REDUCE ALCOHOL DRINKING. THUS, THE BALANCE BETWEEN ANTI- AND PRO-STRESS SIGNALING IS LIKELY PERTURBED DURING THE TRANSITION TO ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE, CHARACTERIZED BY AN OVERACTIVE CRF SYSTEM. OT PRODUCING NEURONS IN THE PARAVENTRICULAR AND SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEI OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS PROJECT TO BOTH THE CEA AND BNST, TO SPECIFIC SUBDIVISIONS THAT CONTAIN CRF NEURONS. THUS, OT MAY ACT DIRECTLY ON CRF NEURONS OF THE CEA AND BNST TO DECREASE WITHDRAWAL SEVERITY AND ALCOHOL DRINKING. THIS PROJECT WILL CHARACTERIZE HYPOTHALAMIC OT NEURONAL INPUT TO CRF NEURONS OF THE CEA AND BNST, WHETHER THESE CIRCUITS ARE DISRUPTED BY ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE, AND INVOLVEMENT OF THESE CIRCUITS IN ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE INDUCED DRINKING. VIRAL VECTOR MEDIATED EXPRESSION OF FLUORESCENT MARKERS AND DESIGNER RECEPTORS EXCLUSIVELY ACTIVATED BY DESIGNER DRUGS (DREADDS) WILL ALLOW FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF OT CIRCUITS IN THE CEA AND BNST, AND BEHAVIORAL TESTING OF OT CIRCUIT INVOLVEMENT IN ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE INDUCED ALCOHOL DRINKING. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WILL BEGIN DURING THE K99 PHASE, AND WILL BE COMPLETED DURING THE R00 PHASE AT A NEW INSTITUTION IN THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR\u2019S (PI) INDEPENDENT LABORATORY. TOWARDS THIS CAREER GOAL, DURING THE K99 PHASE, THE PI WILL TRAIN UNDER THE MENTORSHIP TEAM IN NEW TECHNIQUES INCLUDING THE USE OF VIRAL VECTOR BASED PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND SYNAPTIC TRACING, IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION, AND BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY TO COMPLEMENT THE PI\u2019S EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY. DURING THE R00 PHASE, THE MENTORSHIP TEAM WILL HELP ESTABLISH THESE TECHNIQUES IN THE PI\u2019S INDEPENDENT LABORATORY TO ENSURE CONTINUITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE RESEARCH PLAN. COLLECTIVELY, THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE ROLE OF OT AS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC IN TREATING ALCOHOL AND STRESS/ANXIETY DISORDERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7bb49047-7166-d4e3-8873-4218d87cf06c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R00AA026638_7529"}, {"internal_id": 86316824, "Award ID": "R00AA026336", "Award Amount": 853118.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-20", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "MECHANISMS BY WHICH ALCOHOL-INDUCED DYSBIOSIS IMPAIRS HOST DEFENSE AGAINST KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NE", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ce6cc294-968c-0136-a2e3-f34319ce4753-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R00AA026336_7529"}, {"internal_id": 85590572, "Award ID": "R00AA026317", "Award Amount": 752410.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-05", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "PREVENTING RISKY DRINKING AND PTSD AFTER SEXUAL ASSAULT: A WEB-BASED INTERVENTION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8a022699-f7be-356a-f01a-3aa6f76016ef-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R00AA026317_7529"}, {"internal_id": 98143352, "Award ID": "R00AA025998", "Award Amount": 735493.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-06-08", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "ANTECEDENTS & CONSEQUENCES OF COLLEGE DRINKING AMONG MEXICAN AMERICANS & EUROPEAN AMERICANS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4bb4ed53-41bf-76e0-acf5-d7192a269685-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R00AA025998_7529"}, {"internal_id": 145529158, "Award ID": "R00AA025991", "Award Amount": 498000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-01-10", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "CHRONIC ETHANOL EFFECTS ON CHOLINERGIC INTERNEURONS OF THE STRIATUM - PROJECT SUMMARY: THE STRIATUM IS IMPLICATED IN LEARNING, REWARD AND ADDICTION, INCLUDING ALCOHOLISM. WITHIN THE STRIATUM, ABLATION OF CHOLINERGIC INTERNEURONS (CINS) RESULTS IN BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS SIMILAR TO THOSE OBSERVED IN ALCOHOLICS. INTERESTINGLY, THERE IS EVIDENCE INDICATING A DECREASE IN CINS FOLLOWING CHRONIC ETHANOL EXPOSURE. IN AGREEMENT, I HAVE FOUND THAT STRIATAL CHOLINERGIC FUNCTION IS IMPAIRED IN MONKEYS FOLLOWING LONG-TERM ETHANOL CONSUMPTION. THEREFORE, THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT CHRONIC ETHANOL EXPOSURE DECREASES STRIATAL CIN NUMBERS OR FUNCTION AND THAT THESE ETHANOL-INDUCED CHOLINERGIC IMPAIRMENTS UNDERLIE THE BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOLISM. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, I PROPOSE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: SPECIFIC AIM 1 \u2013 I WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ACUTE ETHANOL ON STRIATAL CIN SUBTYPES USING TRANSGENIC MICE, IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL, RNASCOPE, AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES. THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CIN SUBTYPE SENSITIVITY TO ETHANOL WILL BE OF BROAD INTEREST TO ALCOHOL AND BASAL GANGLIA RESEARCHERS ALIKE. SPECIFIC AIM 2 \u2013 I WILL DETERMINE IF CHRONIC ETHANOL-INDUCED DEFICITS IN STRIATAL CINS ARE DUE TO A LOSS OF CINS, AN IMPAIRMENT OF CIN FUNCTION, OR BOTH. THERE IS AGREEMENT IN THE LITERATURE THAT THE STRIATAL CHOLINERGIC CIRCUIT IS HYPO-FUNCTIONAL FOLLOWING CHRONIC ETHANOL EXPOSURE BUT THE SOURCE OF THIS DYSFUNCTION IS NOT CLEAR. THEREFORE, I WILL DETERMINE IF CINS ARE LOST AND/OR IF CIN FUNCTION IS COMPROMISED (WITH ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY) FOLLOWING CHRONIC ETHANOL EXPOSURE. THESE RESULTS WILL BE THE FIRST TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC ETHANOL ON STRIATAL CIN FUNCTION. SPECIFIC AIM 3 \u2013 I WILL THEN DETERMINE IF IN VIVO CHEMOGENETIC MANIPULATION OF CIN ACTIVITY AFTER CHRONIC ETHANOL ARE SUFFICIENT TO AMELIORATE THE BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS THAT ACCOMPANY CHRONIC ETHANOL EXPOSURE INCLUDING ETHANOL CONSUMPTION AND PERFORMANCE ON AN OPERANT REVERSAL LEARNING TASK.

RESEARCH-NEBRASKA (ACORN) IS TO EXPAND EXISTING STRENGTHS AND EXPERTISE IN NEBRASKA TO DEVELOP A NOVEL NICHE IN ALCOHOL RESEARCH, BY CREATING A CENTER FOCUSED ON THE ALCOHOL EXPOSOME. ALCOHOL RESEARCH HAS BEEN A MAJOR AREA OF EMPHASIS IN NEBRASKA (AT THE OMAHA VA MEDICAL CENTER RESEARCH SERVICE AND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER) FOR OVER 5 DECADES. AS A RESULT, MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD OF ALCOHOL RESEARCH AND THE TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE HAVE BEEN MADE. STUDIES EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON TRACE METAL METABOLISM, LUNG BIOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY, MECHANISMS OF ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER, ROLE OF ALDEHYDE ADDUCTS IN ALCOHOLIC CELL INJURY, HEPATIC PROTEIN TRAFFICKING AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION EVENTS AND THE ROLE OF IMMUNE MECHANISMS IN ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE KEY AREAS OF INVESTIGATION. OUR GOAL IS TO TRANSLATE TO HUMANS HOW FACTORS IN THE EXPOSOME SUCH AS AGE, NUTRITIONAL STATUS, CIGARETTE SMOKING, AND EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS INTERACT IN THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ALCOHOL ADMINISTRATION. WE KNOW THAT A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE SPECIFIC EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT IS THE LIFESTYLE FACTOR OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. THUS, UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE SCHEMA OF THE EXPOSOME, ALCOHOL REPRESENTS AN ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONTEXT WITH OTHER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS TO UNDERSTAND CAUSES AND NATURE OF DISEASE PROGRESSION. THE OVERALL HYPOTHESIS OF OUR APPLICATION IS THE FOLLOWING: THE EXAMINATION OF ALCOHOL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXPOSOME WILL ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND ITS ROLE MORE FULLY IN THE ETIOLOGY OF DISEASE AND THE SUBSEQUENT MANIFESTATIONS OF ALCOHOL-INDUCED HUMAN PATHOPHYSIOLOGY. THE ALCOHOL-EXPOSOME THEME OF THE CENTER IS UNIQUE AMONG ALCOHOL CENTERS AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE HIGHLY TRANSLATIONAL. OUR INVESTIGATORS REPRESENT AN OUTSTANDING TEAM OF INTERDISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATORS THAT WILL BE SUPPORTED BY AN ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, A BIOSPECIMEN CORE, AND A PILOT PROJECTS CORE. ACORN INVESTIGATORS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO STATE-OF-THE ART FACILITIES AT UNMC, NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER AND UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA-LINCOLN. WE INCLUDE FACULTY FROM 5 DEPARTMENTS AND 3 COLLEGES. OUR PROPOSED SPECIFIC AIMS FOR THE ACORN ARE TO: 1) FACILITATE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND IDENTIFY FACTORS SO THAT WE CAN TRANSLATE IN HUMANS HOW AGE, NUTRITIONAL STATUS, CIGARETTE SMOKING, AND EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS INTERACT IN THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ALCOHOL ADMINISTRATION. 2) CREATE A BIOSPECIMEN CORE TO AID CENTER INVESTIGATORS IN PROMOTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL AND HUMAN TISSUE AND CELL MODELS. 3) ENHANCE THE COLLABORATIVE ACORN ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUNDING THROUGH TRAINING, SYMPOSIA, AND PILOT GRANTS. WORK ON OUR 4 RESEARCH PROJECTS, WITH PARTICIPATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION CORE AND THE BIOSPECIMEN CORE WILL ALLOW US TO REALIZE OUR GOALS. OVERALL, THIS NEW P50 WILL UTILIZE THE EXPERTISE AND KNOWLEDGE OF PAST RESEARCH EFFORTS TO EXAMINE HOW ALCOHOL, IN THE SETTING OF VARIOUS EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WILL INFLUENCE DISEASE IN A VARIETY OF ORGANS AND HELP US SHAPE OUR FUTURE ANIMAL AND HUMAN STUDIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NE", "COVID-19 Obligations":

SHARE P01 RESEARCH PROGRAM PROJECT IS TO ADDRESS HIV AND ALCOHOL USE AROUND THREE THEMES; 1) EMERGING ADULTHOOD (AGES 18 -29); 2) SELF-MANAGEMENT OF HIV AND ALCOHOL; AND 3) TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE. EMERGING ADULTHOOD IS A DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE MARKED BY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN SOCIAL ROLES, EXPECTATIONS AS A NEW ADULT, AND INCREASED RESPONSIBILITIES. IT IS ALSO MARKED BY POOR HIV SELF- MANAGEMENT AND INCREASED ALCOHOL USE. EMERGING ADULTS WITH HIV (HEREAFTER CALLED YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV; YPLWH) MAY FACE EVEN MORE CHALLENGES GIVEN INTERSECTIONAL STIGMA. THIS AGE GROUP CONTINUES TO HAVE VERY HIGH RATES OF NEW HIV INFECTIONS. INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE UNIQUE DEVELOPMENTAL CHALLENGES OF EMERGING ADULTS ARE NEEDED, YET EMERGING ADULTS ARE OFTEN INCLUDED WITH OLDER ADULTS IN INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. THE CONCEPT OF SELF-MANAGEMENT EMERGED CONCURRENTLY WITHIN BOTH THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND CHRONIC ILLNESS LITERATURES, AND FITS WELL WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL CHALLENGES OF EMERGING ADULTHOOD. SELF-MANAGEMENT, A FRAMEWORK WE HAVE UTILIZED IN OUR WORK WITH YPLWH, REFERS TO THE ABILITY TO MANAGE SYMPTOMS, TREATMENTS, LIFESTYLE CHANGES, AND CONSEQUENCES OF HEALTH CONDITIONS. CURRENT RESEARCH NOW IDENTIFIES INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL SELF-MANAGEMENT SKILLS SUCH AS SELF-CONTROL, DECISION-MAKING, SELF-REINFORCEMENT, AND PROBLEM SOLVING AS THAT PROTECT AGAINST SUBSTANCE USE AND IMPROVE OTHER HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CAN BE EMBEDDED IN THE INFORMATION-MOTIVATION-BEHAVIORAL SKILLS MODEL. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CONDUCTED MULTIPLE STUDIES WITH YPLWH, ONLY ONE INTERVENTION TO DATE (HEALTHY CHOICES CONDUCTED BY OUR TEAM) IMPROVED BOTH ALCOHOL USE AND VIRAL SUPPRESSION IN YPLWH IN LARGE TRIALS. THE GOAL OF THE SHARE P01 IS TO UTILIZE ADVANCES IN TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE TO OPTIMIZE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS AND DEFINE NEW DEVELOPMENTALLY- AND CULTURALLY-APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION TARGETS TO IMPROVE SELF-MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL AND HIV IN YPLWH. WE WILL FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN FLORIDA, A STATE HARDEST HIT BY THE HIV EPIDEMIC BUT WITH A PARTICULARLY STRONG ACADEMIC- COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO SUPPORT TRANSLATION. WE HAVE ASSEMBLED RESEARCH TEAMS TO CONDUCT SELF- MANAGEMENT STUDIES ACROSS THE TRANSLATIONAL SPECTRUM TO ADDRESS SELF-MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVE ALCOHOL USE AND VIRAL SUPPRESSION (AND THEREBY REDUCE TRANSMISSION) IN DIVERSE YPLWH IN FLORIDA. THE P01 WILL CONSIST OF THREE RESEARCH PROJECTS (DEFINE, ENGAGE, AND SUSTAIN), REPRESENTING DIFFERENT STAGES ON THE TRANSLATIONAL SPECTRUM AND TARGETING DIFFERENT CORE COMPETENCIES, SUPPORTED BY TWO CORES (COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE AND DATA SCIENCE CORE). IF SUCCESSFUL, THE SHARE P01 HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GREATLY ADVANCE PROGRAMS PROMOTING SELF-MANAGEMENT OF HIV AND ALCOHOL USE AMONG A PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE, BUT UNDER-RESEARCHED GROUP, EMERGING ADULTS LIVING WITH HIV.

UNHEALTHY DRINKING CAN EXACERBATE TWO HIGHLY PREVALENT HIV-RELATED COMORBIDITIES/CO-OCCURRING CONDITIONS, CHRONIC PAIN AND PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, WHICH IN TURN, CAN INTENSIFY ALCOHOL USE AND AFFECT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL FUNCTION IN PLWH.

IN BOSTON ARCH CC WE TARGET IN RANDOMIZED TRIALS THESE TWO MODIFIABLE CONDITIONS, PAIN AND PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, THAT HAVE A CRITICAL IMPACT ON A VARIETY OF OTHER HIV-RELATED COMORBIDITIES. BOSTON ARCH CC CONTAINS 4 INTEGRATED COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH: TWO RANDOMIZED TRIALS (RESEARCH PROJECT COMPONENTS), AN ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC) THAT COORDINATES THE P01, AND A BIOSTATISTICS AND DATA MANAGEMENT (BDM) CORE THAT SUPPORTS THE TRIALS METHODOLOGICALLY AND PROVIDES DATA MANAGEMENT AND BIOSTATISTICAL EXPERTISE TO THEM, AND CONTINUES SECONDARY ANALYSES USING EXTANT BOSTON ARCH DATA.

POLYPHARMACY AND GENETIC LIABILITY ALSO COMPLICATE SELECTION OF TREATMENT FOR AUD. IN HARP PROJECT 2, WE USE GENETIC LIABILITY AND REAL-WORLD DATA TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE CANDIDATE MEDICATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF POLYPHARMACY. FURTHER, AP RISKS, ESPECIALLY GENETIC LIABILITY, ARE COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING TO SUMMARIZE.

OUR SECOND PROJECT IS A HYBRID TYPE1 EFFECTIVENESS-IMPLEMENTATION PILOT TRIAL DEVELOPING AND TESTING A NOVEL RELAPSE PREVENTION INTERVENTION (RPI) FOR PWH. THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR FOCUS ON RPI IS HIGHLIGHTED BY OUR RECENT FINDING THAT ANY ALCOHOL USE AMONG PWH WITH AUD IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED VIREMIA AND THE WELL-ESTABLISHED HIGH RELAPSE PREVALENCE OF 50 \u2013 75% OF PERSONS IN REMISSION.

ALCOHOL USE IS INCREASINGLY BEING RECOGNIZED AS A DRIVER OF THE TB EPIDEMIC, AND MAY BE A VITAL MEANS TO MITIGATE HIV/TB MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. TB PREVENTIVE THERAPY (TPT) IS AN IMPORTANT APPROACH IN PREVENTING THE PROGRESSION OF LATENT TB INFECTION TO ACTIVE TB DISEASE. HOWEVER, TPT DOES NOT PREVENT NEW OR REPEAT TB INFECTION, THUS PLWH WHO DRINK ALCOHOL MAY REMAIN AT INCREASED RISK FOR TB ACQUISITION, EVEN AFTER RECEIPT OF TPT. HEAVY ALCOHOL USE IS COMMON AMONG PERSONS LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH). WHILE THE INCREASED RISK FOR ACTIVE TB IS ATTRIBUTED TO ALCOHOL-RELATED IMMUNOSUPPRESSION LEADING TO LATENT TB RE-ACTIVATION, THE ROLE OF ALCOHOL USE IN ACQUIRING NEW OR REPEAT TB INFECTION AND PROGRESSION TO ACTIVE TB DISEASE AFTER TPT HAS NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY EXAMINED, INCLUDING AMONG PLWH.

THE KEY QUESTION WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS IN THIS APPLICATION IS HOW NEUTROPHILS DRIVES DISEASE SEVERITY AND MEDIATES LIVER INJURY IN ALD. MECHANISTICALLY, NEUTROPHILS, AS AN INNATE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE, MEDIATES TISSUE INJURY BY PRODUCING INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS AND REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS). ROS PRODUCTION IN NEUTROPHILS IS REGULATED BY THE MULTI-MERIC TRANSMEMBRANE ENZYME COMPLEX, NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHATE (NADPH) OXIDASE (NOX).

HISPANICS SUFFER FROM ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) AND ALCOHOL-RELATED LIVER DISEASE AT RATES SIMILAR TO NON-HISPANIC WHITES. HOWEVER, HISPANICS WITH AUD ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE TREATMENT THAN NON- HISPANIC WHITES. HISPANICS ALSO FACE GREATER SOCIOECONOMIC, CULTURAL, AND LINGUISTIC BARRIERS TO TREATMENT FOR AUD THAN NON-HISPANIC WHITES. THESE BARRIERS INCLUDE LIMITED ACCESS TO SPANISH-SPEAKING PROVIDERS AND CULTURALLY ADAPTED EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS. COMPUTERIZED TREATMENTS AND MOBILE TECHNOLOGY HAVE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO INCREASE ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER FOR SPANISH SPEAKERS. A CULTURALLY ADAPTED COMPUTERIZED TREATMENT FOR SPANISH-SPEAKING HISPANICS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY AT REDUCING RATES OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG USE IN A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL (COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING FOR COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; SPANISH CBT4CBT). SEVERAL OTHER CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE SUPPORTED THE EFFICACY AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF ENGLISH VERSIONS OF CBT4CBT. RAPID, MOBILE DELIVERY OF CBT SKILLS WOULD FACILITATE TREATMENT FEASIBILITY DURING RISKY PERIODS FOR DRINKING IN DAILY LIFE (E.G. WEEKEND EVENINGS). BUT, CBT4CBT MODULES EACH REQUIRE 35-40 MINUTES OF SUSTAINED ATTENTION TO COMPLETE AND CANNOT BE USED QUICKLY DURING HIGH- RISK DRINKING PERIODS. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A CONCENTRATED MOBILE VERSION OF SPANISH CBT4CBT TO RAPIDLY DELIVER TREATMENT CONTENT ON HIGH-RISK DRINKING DAYS: AIM 1) IDENTIFY SPANISH CBT4CBT MODULE TOPICS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER REDUCTIONS IN DAILY ALCOHOL USE AND PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS. AIM 2) DEVELOP A CONCENTRATED VERSION OF SPANISH CBT4CBT CONSISTING OF A SUBSET OF CONTENT FROM THE CURRENT MODULES. AIM 3) TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF USING SMARTPHONES TO DELIVER A CONCENTRATED VERSION OF SPANISH CBT4CBT ON HIGH-RISK DRINKING DAYS.  TO COMPLETE THESE AIMS, MY CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN INCLUDES MENTORED TRAINING IN THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS: 1) CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS OF TREATMENTS FOR AUD; 2) DESIGNING CULTURALLY ADAPTED TREATMENTS FOR HISPANICS; 3) DELIVERING TREATMENT COMPONENTS THROUGH SMARTPHONES; 4) USING MIXED METHODS TO EXPLORE STAKEHOLDERS\u2019 PERSPECTIVES ON TREATMENTS FOR AUD; 5) FOSTERING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH GRANT WRITING, PUBLISHING, LEADERSHIP, AND NETWORKING.

HEAVY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IMPAIRS BRAIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, MORE SEVERELY IN YOUNG ADULTS THAN IN OLDER ADULTS. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR AUD IN YOUNG ADULTS ARE LACKING, AND THE NEURAL MECHANISMS FOLLOWING AVAILABLE BEHAVIOR TREATMENTS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE AIMS OF THE K99 PHASE ARE (1) TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT (CM) AND PROBLEM-SOLVING THERAPY (PST), CM-PST INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE ALCOHOL ABSTINENCE AMONG YOUNG ADULTS WITH AUD, AND (2) TEST FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE INTERVENTION. THE AIMS OF THE R00 PHASE ARE TO (1) TEST THE EFFICACY OF CM-PST VS CM ALONE IN A 2-ARM PILOT RCT, AND (2) ASSESS NEURAL MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH CM-PST TREATMENT EFFECTS IN YOUNG ADULTS WITH AUD. SUPPORT FROM THIS AWARD WILL ENABLE DR. HALLIHAN TO LAUNCH AN INDEPENDENT PROGRAM OF RESEARCH THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE FIELD BY 1) DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AN INNOVATIVE INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE ALCOHOL ABSTINENCE AMONG YOUNG ADULTS WITH AUD, AND 2) ASSESS NEURAL MECHANISMS OF SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT AMONG YOUNG ADULTS WITH AUD TO INFORM FUTURE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION EFFORTS AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE PUBLIC HEALTH BURDEN OF AUD.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "98f86457-cdff-6b3c-9ff8-3a4415183bf6-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K99AA030665_7529"}, {"internal_id": 157813255, "Award ID": "K99AA030628", "Award Amount": 107869.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-03-28", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "REGULATION OF ALCOHOL-INDUCED SOCIAL DISTURBANCES BY LATERAL HABENULA SEROTONIN RECEPTORS - THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS GREATLY EXACERBATED RISING PATTERNS OF EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, PARTICULARLY IN WOMEN. BINGE ALCOHOL DRINKING IS THE MOST COMMON PATTERN OF EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL DRINKING AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING MOOD DISORDERS AND ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD). SOCIAL SUPPORT STRONGLY BUFFERS AGAINST ALCOHOL CRAVING AND RELAPSE, YET MANY INDIVIDUALS DISPLAY REDUCED VALUATION OF SOCIAL REWARDS AND/OR DEFICITS IN THE PROCESSING OF SOCIAL STIMULI FOLLOWING ALCOHOL EXPOSURE AND SUBSEQUENT ABSTINENCE. THIS MAY COMPOUND INTERPERSONAL PROBLEMS IN PEOPLE WITH AUD AND LIMIT THEIR CAPACITY TO SEEK OUT OR RECEIVE SOCIAL SUPPORT. THEREFORE, UNDERSTANDING THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS MEDIATING ALCOHOL\u2019S EFFECTS ON SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IS REQUIRED TO INFORM FUTURE TREATMENTS AIMED AT ENHANCING SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND REDUCING RELAPSE IN PATIENTS WITH AUD. DRINKING IN THE DARK (DID) IS A ROBUST PARADIGM FOR INVESTIGATING THE CIRCUIT AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF BINGE-LIKE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION ON PHYSIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR IN RODENTS. IN ADDITION, THE 3-CHAMBER SOCIABILITY MODEL PERMITS THE INTERROGATION OF BOTH SOCIAL REWARD AND SOCIAL RECOGNITION BEHAVIORS FOLLOWING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. SEROTONIN (5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE, 5-HT) RECEPTOR SIGNALING IN THE LATERAL HABENULA (LHB) HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL STATES ASSOCIATED WITH ABSTINENCE FROM ALCOHOL, BUT THE LHB REMAINS HIGHLY UNDERSTUDIED IN THE CONTEXT OF AUD. I RECENTLY FOUND THAT DID REDUCED SOCIAL RECOGNITION SELECTIVELY IN FEMALE MICE DURING ABSTINENCE, AND THAT GENETIC DELETION OF THE LHB GQ-PROTEIN COUPLED SEROTONIN RECEPTOR 5HT2C PARTIALLY PREVENTED THIS EFFECT. MY PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGESTS THAT BINGE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION ENHANCES THE INTRINSIC EXCITABILITY OF LHB 5HT2C-CONTAINING NEURONS (LHB5HT2C) IN THE MEDIAL SUB- REGION, THAT 5-HT IS RELEASED ONTO LHB5HT2C DURING SOCIAL INTERACTION, AND THAT ACUTE ENGAGEMENT OF GI SIGNALING IN LHB5HT2C CAN NORMALIZE SOCIAL DEFICITS INDUCED BY ALCOHOL. MOREOVER, DID APPEARS TO MODULATE THE EXPRESSION OF MULTIPLE 5-HT RECEPTOR SUBTYPES CO-EXPRESSED IN LHB5HT2C. TOGETHER, THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT EXCESSIVE ACTIVATION OF LHB5HT2C VIA DYSREGULATION OF 5-HT RECEPTOR SIGNALING MAY UNDERLIE SOCIAL DEFICITS INDUCED BY ALCOHOL. USING THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE CURRENT PROPOSAL, I WILL 1) CHARACTERIZE HOW DID ALTERS THE TRANSLATIONAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE OF LHB5HT2C PROJECTING TO THE DRN (5HT2CLHB-DRN) AND 2) INVESTIGATE THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACT OF GENETIC MANIPULATION OF 5-HT RECEPTOR SUB-TYPES IN 5HT2CLHB-DRN ON NEURONAL PHYSIOLOGY AND DID-INDUCED DYSREGULATION OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. TOGETHER, THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF BINGE ALCOHOL DRINKING ON MOLECULAR AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN 5HT2CLHB-DRN AND IDENTIFY NOVEL MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE NEURONS PROMOTE SOCIAL DYSFUNCTION DURING ABSTINENCE.

SOCIAL ISOLATION IS A PARTICULARLY PROFOUND STRESSOR WITH INCREASING HUMAN RELEVANCE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHEN MILLIONS OF ADOLESCENTS HAVE FACED PROLONGED PERIODS WITH LIMITED AND INTERMITTENT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH PEERS. THE ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM (ECS) IS CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND MODULATES SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION PROCESSES, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE CENTRAL NUCLEUS OF THE AMYGDALA (CEA), A HUB OF STRESS AND ANXIETY PROCESSING. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT ADOLESCENT SOCIAL ISOLATION STRESS AND ALCOHOL DRINKING HIJACKS THE DEVELOPING BRAIN BY DISRUPTING THE ECS AND RESULTING IN LONG-LASTING SYNAPTIC NEUROADAPTATIONS THAT PREDISPOSE TO ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD), ANXIETY, AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS, AND SOCIAL INTERACTION DEFICITS. UNLIKE ADULT ALCOHOL EXPOSURE, THE SYNAPTIC AND BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF ADOLESCENT BINGE DRINKING OFTEN DO NOT RECOVER FOLLOWING PERIODS OF ABSTINENCE, SUGGESTING THAT EXPERIENCING SOCIAL ISOLATION AND ALCOHOL DRINKING DURING ADOLESCENCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PERMANENTLY DISRUPT THE BRAIN\u2019S DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY.

THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO 1) DISTINGUISH SGM SUBGROUPS AND INTERSECTIONS AT HEIGHTENED RISK FOR AU (E.G., BISEXUALS AND TRANS PERSONS, SGM YOUNG WOMEN OF COLOR), 2) ASSESS THE ROLE OF STATE POLICIES IN MODERATING AU RISK, AND 3) DELINEATE MODERATORS AND MECHANISMS OF HEIGHTENED AU ACROSS SGM POPULATIONS WITHIN AND BEYOND THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THE MENTORED PHASE (K99) WILL INVOLVE CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE ALL OF US RESEARCH PROGRAM (AURP), A LARGE (N=331,360) AND DIVERSE NATIONAL DATASET. AIM 1 WILL IDENTIFY HETEROGENEITY IN ALCOHOL AND OTHER SUBSTANCE USE BEHAVIORS AMONG SEXUAL (1A; N=38,820 NON-HETEROSEXUAL) AND GENDER MINORITY (1B; N=2,660 TRANSGENDER OR NONBINARY) COMMUNITIES. IT WILL THEN TEST RACE/ETHNICITY AND AGE AS INTERSECTIONAL MODERATORS OF SGM INEQUITIES (1C) AND STATE-LEVEL POLICIES IMPACTING SGM COMMUNITIES (1D; E.G., HATE CRIME LAWS ENUMERATING SGM IDENTITY) THAT FURTHER DIFFERENTIATE AU RISK AMONG SGM GROUPS. DURING THE INDEPENDENT PHASE, FINDINGS WILL BE EXTENDED TO ADDRESS MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS OF AU IN THE MONTHLY AURP COVID-19 PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCE SURVEY (AIM 2; N=100,340) AS WELL AS THE LONGITUDINAL, BIENNIAL AURP DATA THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE PANDEMIC INTO 2027 (AIM 3). AIM 2 WILL TEST PANDEMIC STRESSORS AS MEDIATORS OF BETWEEN-PERSON AU AMONG SGM INTERSECTIONS (2A) AND EXAMINE INTERSECTIONAL (2B) AND MULTILEVEL MODERATORS (2C) OF WITHIN-PERSON AU. AIM 3 WILL TEST DIFFERENCES IN POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY IN AU AMONG SGM INTERSECTIONS (3A) AND DETERMINE PANDEMIC MEDIATORS (3B) AND MODERATORS (3C) OF THIS CHANGE.

THE UNIQUE AUXILIARY PROTEIN, TRANSMEMBRANE AMPAR REGULATORY PROTEIN (TARP) -8, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REGULATE AMPAR TRAFFICKING, ACTIVITY, AND CAMKII-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY, MAKING IT CRITICAL FOR AMPAR MEDIATED NEURAL TRANSMISSION. AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF TARP -8 IS ITS HIGHLY RESTRICTED EXPRESSION LIMITED TO CORTICOLIMBIC REGIONS KNOWN TO REGULATE GLUTAMATERGIC RESPONSE TO ALCOHOL INCLUDING THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (MPFC), BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA (BLA), AND THE HIPPOCAMPUS, WHILE NOTICEABLY ABSENT FROM THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS (NAC). EVIDENCE INDICATES CHRONIC ALCOHOL INCREASES GLUTAMATE LEVELS, WHICH IN TURN PROMOTES THE INFLUX OF CALCIUM, AND INITIATING A CASCADE WHERE CAMKII PHOSPHORYLATES AMPARS TO INCREASE AND SUSTAIN AMPAR ACTIVITY.

RECENTLY, EPIGENETIC PROCESSES SUCH AS HISTONE ACETYLATION EMERGED AS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTORS TO AUD. ACETYLATION OF HISTONES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO FACILITATE DNA ACCESSIBILITY AND GENE EXPRESSION. THE DYNAMIC AND REVERSIBLE NATURE OF THIS PROCESS MAKES IT A PARTICULARLY PROMISING POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGET.  NOVEL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EPIGENETIC REGULATION IS DEPENDENT ON METABOLIC STATE, IMPLICATING SPECIFIC METABOLIC FACTORS IN NEURAL FUNCTIONS THAT DRIVE BEHAVIOR (LI*, EGERVARI* ET AL, NAT REV MOL CELL BIOL 2018). RECENTLY, OUR GROUP HAS SHOWN THAT NEURONAL HISTONE ACETYLATION IS FUELED BY THE METABOLITE ACETYL-COA THAT IS PRODUCED FROM ACETATE BY NUCLEAR ACETYL-COA SYNTHETASE 2 (ACSS2; MEWS ET AL, NATURE 2017). AS A MAJOR BIOLOGICAL SOURCE OF ACETATE IS ALCOHOL METABOLISM, I HYPOTHESIZED THAT ALCOHOL-DERIVED ACETATE MIGHT HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON THE EPIGENETIC LANDSCAPE IN THE BRAIN FOLLOWING BINGE DRINKING. USING HEAVY ISOTOPE LABELING IN MICE, I SHOWED THAT ALCOHOL METABOLISM RAPIDLY PROMOTES HISTONE ACETYLATION IN THE BRAIN BY DIRECT DEPOSITION OF ALCOHOL-DERIVED ACETYL GROUPS ONTO HISTONES IN AN ACSS2-DEPENDENT MANNER. I OBSERVED SIMILAR INCORPORATION OF ALCOHOL-DERIVED ACETATE INTO FETAL BRAIN, SUGGESTING A POTENTIAL ROLE FOR ACSS2 DURING PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE.

HOWEVER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRESS AND ALCOHOL IS BIDIRECTIONAL. ON ONE HAND, STRESS IS AN ETIOLOGICAL FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, PATHOLOGICAL (I.E., ALLOSTATIC) ADAPTATIONS IN THE STRESS RESPONSE OCCUR DUE TO CONTINUED USE. ACTIVATION OF THE STRESS AXIS LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN CIRCULATING ADRENAL STEROIDS, INCLUDING GLUCOCORTICOIDS (CORTISOL), MINERALOCORTICOIDS (DEOXYCORTICOSTERONE AND ALDOSTERONE) AND ANDROGENS (DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE). THESE ADRENAL STEROIDS INFLUENCE ORGANS AND SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE BODY, INCLUDING THE LIVER, HEART, BRAIN AND IMMUNE SYSTEM.

JOHN CRABBE, ARPANA AGRAWAL, KATHLEEN BUCHOLZ, KRISTINA JACKSON, AND DAVID WATSON) COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE EXPERTISE THAT IS IDEALLY SUITED TO FACILITATE THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED TRAINING AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. FURTHERMORE, THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI IS A WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH INSTITUTION WITH THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO FACILITATE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE TRAINING (K99) PHASE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT. K99 PHASE: WITH SUPERVISION, DR. WATTS WILL CONDUCT SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS ON PHENOTYPIC AND GENETIC HETEROGENEITY WITHIN AUD. THIS WORK WILL BE ACHIEVED USING A COMBINATION OF LARGE-SCALE CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL PHENOTYPIC AND GENETICALLY INFORMATIVE DATA. SHE WILL RECEIVE TRAINING VIA MENTORSHIP, COURSEWORK, WORKSHOPS, READINGS, AND CONSULTATION. R00 PHASE: DR. WATTS WILL ASCERTAIN FEATURES OF AUD THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO ALCOHOL USE, RATHER THAN GENERAL TO SUBSTANCE USE, EXTERNALIZING PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, OR PSYCHOPATHOLOGY MORE BROADLY USING PHENOTYPIC, BEHAVIOR GENETIC, AND MOLECULAR GENETIC ANALYSIS. SIGNIFICANCE: HER WORK WILL ULTIMATELY TARGET SOURCES OF HETEROGENEITY WITHIN AUD, CHARACTERIZE SPECIFIC AUD VULNERABILITIES, AND INFORM FUTURE PRECISION-MEDICINE EFFORTS, EACH OF WHICH ARE EMPHASIZED BY NIAAA\u2019S EMPHASES ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF AUD DIAGNOSIS AND UNDERSTANDING ITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER FORMS OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY (NIAAA, 2017).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f261384c-3ac1-b344-de46-81708f87aa6a-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K99AA028306_7529"}, {"internal_id": 98144027, "Award ID": "K99AA028298", "Award Amount": 147119.54, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-06-17", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "ALCOHOL-INDUCED ALTERATIONS IN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX SEROTONIN SIGNALING", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f371179b-9f27-8013-f81c-4fd314b1f981-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K99AA028298_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140058021, "Award ID": "K99AA028291", "Award Amount": 275426.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-14", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "MATERNAL FETAL METABOLIC DISRUPTION IN PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE - PROJECT SUMMARY DESPITE PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS TO REDUCE PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE), 11.7% OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE U.S. CONSUME ALCOHOL AND 3.9% BINGE DRINK. PAE CAN LEAD TO GROWTH RETARDATION, FACIAL DYSMORPHOLOGY AND NEUROBEHAVIORAL DISABILITIES, THE KEY MANIFESTATIONS OF FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS (FASD). ALTHOUGH THE GROWTH DEFICITS CORRELATE WITH THE COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL IMPAIRMENTS, WE LACK MECHANISTIC INSIGHT INTO THE BASIS FOR THESE GROWTH DEFICITS. A MAJOR DRIVER OF FETAL GROWTH DEFICITS IS MATERNAL METABOLIC DISRUPTION, AND ALTHOUGH ALCOHOL IS WELL-KNOWN TO ALTER METABOLISM, SURPRISINGLY, THIS HAS BEEN MINIMALLY INVESTIGATED IN PAE. MY PRELIMINARY DATA ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, AND SHOW THAT ALCOHOL REDUCES MATERNAL-FETAL GLUCOSE POOLS, WITH COMMENSURATE RISE IN FETAL AMINO ACID CATABOLITES INCLUDING UREA. ALTHOUGH ALCOHOL STIMULATES SKELETAL MUSCLE CATABOLISM, I FIND NO SIGN THAT THIS HAPPENS IN ALCOHOL-EXPOSED DAMS. INSTEAD, MY PRELIMINARY STUDIES FIND THAT ALCOHOL-EXPOSED DAMS FAIL TO UNDERGO AN EXPECTED ADAPTATION TO AN INSULIN-RESISTANT STATE. MOREOVER, I FIND THAT ALCOHOL-DRIVEN CHANGES IN MATERNAL FASTING GLUCOSE AND INSULIN CORRELATE WITH THE ALCOHOL-MEDIATED REDUCTIONS IN FETAL BODY AND BRAIN WEIGHT. LAUNCHING FROM THESE DATA, THIS PROPOSAL USES AN ESTABLISHED MOUSE MODEL OF PAE AND TESTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ALCOHOL PREVENTS THE DAM FROM ENTERING AN INSULIN-RESISTANT STATE, THUS LIMITING FETAL GLUCOSE AVAILABILITY, AND THEREBY INCREASING FETAL RELIANCE ON AMINO ACIDS TO SUPPORT GLUCONEOGENESIS INSTEAD OF GROWTH. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE K99 PORTION QUANTIFIES MATERNAL-FETAL FED/FASTED GLUCOSE LEVELS, GLUCONEOGENESIS, AND THEIR RELATED METABOLITE POOLS TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALCOHOL ALTERS MATERNAL-FETAL ENERGETICS TO REDUCE FETAL GLUCOSE AVAILABILITY. THE SECOND PHASE OF THE K99 PORTION QUANTIFIES INSULIN SIGNALING, AND GLUCOSE STORAGE AND UTILIZATION IN MATERNAL LIVER, TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ALCOHOL PREVENTS MATERNAL ADAPTATION TO INSULIN RESISTANCE. FINALLY, THE R00 PHASE WILL IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM(S) THAT MEDIATES THIS ADAPTIVE FAILURE IN ALCOHOL-EXPOSED DAMS, FOCUSING ON MAJOR CANDIDATE DRIVERS INCLUDING LEPTIN-RESISTANCE, AND PROLACTIN AND PLACENTAL LACTOGEN ACTIVITY. FUTURE STUDIES WILL TEST THESE CANDIDATES FUNCTIONALLY USING ORGAN-TARGETED TRANSGENIC AND KNOCKOUT MOUSE MODELS. I WILL BE TRAINED IN THE METHODOLOGIES OF WHOLE-ANIMAL AND CELLULAR METABOLIC ASSESSMENT AND AN IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF INSULIN/LEPTIN SIGNALING IN PREGNANCY. I WILL ALSO BE TRAINED IN MOUSE BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT, LOOKING TOWARD FUTURE STUDIES OF HOW THESE METABOLIC CHANGES MAY IMPACT COGNITIVE FUNCTION. THIS WORK PROVIDES NOVEL, MECHANISTIC INSIGHT INTO THE BASIS FOR THE FETAL GROWTH DEFICITS THAT TYPIFY FASD, FOCUSING ON KEY, HERETOFORE OVERLOOKED METABOLIC PROCESSES.

IN ADDITION TO ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS SUCH AS HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES, BINGE INTAKE IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE, IS A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. DESPITE THIS, THERE ARE LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR BINGE DRINKING OR ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS AS A WHOLE. STRESS-RELATED NEUROPEPTIDES IN THE CENTRAL AMYGDALA (CEA) HAVE EMERGED AS IMPORTANT TARGETS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL PHARMACOTHERAPIES, HOWEVER THE ROLE OF ONE OF THE MOST DENSELY EXPRESSED \u2018ANTI-STRESS\u2019 NEUROPEPTIDES WITHIN THE BRAIN, SOMATOSTATIN (SST), IN BINGE DRINKING BEHAVIOR HAS GONE ESSENTIALLY NEGLECTED. THIS OMISSION IS OF PARTICULAR NOTE AS SST IS WELL KNOWN AS BOTH A NEUROMODULATOR AND A NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR, ALLOWING IT TO ALTER CEA ACTIVITY BY DIRECT INTERACTIONS WITH NEURONS AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH MODULATING ASTROCYTIC ACTIVITY. I HYPOTHESIZE BINGE-ETHANOL INTAKE WILL DYSREGULATE SST RECEPTORS EXPRESSED ON BOTH NEURAL AND ASTROCYTIC POPULATIONS AND, FURTHER, THAT ASTROCYTE MODULATION OF INHIBITORY TRANSMISSION ON TO SST-EXPRESSING CELLS WILL LIKEWISE BE DYSREGULATED, RESULTING IN DECREASED ABILITY OF THIS IMPORTANT \u2018ANTI-STRESS\u2019 PEPTIDE TO REGULATE CEA ACTIVITY. THESE DYSREGULATIONS WOULD BE PERFECTLY POISED TO SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELL-ESTABLISHED INCREASE IN CEA ACTIVITY KNOWN TO OCCUR DURING ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE. DISSECTING BINGE-ETHANOL INDUCED ALTERATIONS IN CEA SST SYSTEM EXPRESSION AND FUNCTION IN NON- DEPENDENT ANIMALS WILL THEREFORE ENABLE BOTH DISCOVERY OF NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR THIS RISKY PATTERN OF INTAKE AND PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO INITIAL ETHANOL-INDUCED ALTERATIONS OF A REGION CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE.

THE R00 PHASE OF THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL USE THESE TECHNIQUES IN COMBINATION WITH MY EXISTING EXPERTISE IN CHEMOGENETIC TECHNOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY TO 1) ASSESS THE ROLE OF THE SST-EXPRESSING CEA NEURON TO BED NUCLEUS OF THE STRIA TERMINALIS (BNST) PROJECTION IN BINGE-DRINKING BEHAVIOR; AND 2) ASSESS BINGE-ETHANOL INDUCED CHANGES IN SST RECEPTOR EXPRESSION WITHIN THE BNST AND BNST ASTROCYTE MODULATION OF CEA SST TERMINAL ACTIVITY WITHIN THE BNST.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f371179b-9f27-8013-f81c-4fd314b1f981-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K99AA028268_7529"}, {"internal_id": 128681764, "Award ID": "K99AA028265", "Award Amount": 381861.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-03-08", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "IDENTIFYING HOW ALCOHOL-EVOKED CHANGES IN NEURAL FIRING AFFECT SYSTEMS LEVEL COMPUTATIONS DURING DECISION-MAKING - PROJECT SUMMARY THE PRIMARY TRAINING OBJECTIVE OF THE K99 PHASE OF THIS K99/R00 APPLICATION IS TO PROVIDE THE CANDIDATE WITH TRAINING IN STATE-OF-THE-ART ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY TECHNIQUES IN PREPARATION FOR A CAREER AS AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR IN THE FIELD OF ALCOHOL RESEARCH. THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT DECISION-MAKING MALFUNCTIONS IN ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) ARE CAUSED BY CONCURRING NEURAL ACTIVITY CHANGES IN MULTIPLE KEY BRAIN REGIONS THAT SERVE TO ROUTE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS THROUGH DIFFERENT CIRCUITS. TO ADDRESS THIS HYPOTHESIS, THIS AWARD WILL USE HIGH-DENSITY NEURAL PROBES TO RECORD THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF HUNDREDS OF NEURONS ACROSS MANY BRAIN REGIONS IN HEAD-FIXED MICE DURING THE DECISION TO DRINK. THE CANDIDATE WILL OBTAIN THE NECESSARY TRAINING IN THE USE OF THESE NEURAL PROBES TO GENERATE LARGE NEURAL RECORDING DATA SETS THAT CAN BE USED TO DIRECTLY OBSERVE CHANGES IN THE NEURAL CIRCUITS UNDERLYING MALFUNCTIONING DECISION-MAKING IN AUD. TO OBTAIN THIS NECESSARY TRAINING, THE CANDIDATE WILL WORK WITH LEADING RESEARCHERS ALREADY USING THESE TOOLS IN THE INTERNATIONAL BRAIN LABORATORY COLLABORATION AND ATTEND A TRAINING WORKSHOP.

ETIOLOGY OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD). GENETIC STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED LOCI ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISORDER; HOWEVER, THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF AUD HAS NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLAINED. CURRENTLY, GENOME-WIDE VARIANT DATA OF THE DISORDER ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS, AND FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC DATASETS ARE BEING GENERATED FROM CONSORTIA. SEQUENCING DATA FROM BIOBANKS WOULD ALLOW ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF CODING AND FUNCTIONAL NON-CODING REGIONS TO AUD RISK BY USING A PROXY PHENOTYPE FROM THE INFORMATION OF THE ALCOHOL USE DISORDER IDENTIFICATION TEST (AUDIT) REPORT. PRIOR WORK HAS SHOWN THAT 1) AUD HAS A HIGH GENETIC OVERLAP WITH SOME NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS (NPDS), AND 2) COMMON-VARIANT STUDIES IDENTIFY BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISORDER. THEREFORE, INTEGRATIVE ANALYSES WHICH INCORPORATE MULTI-OMICS DATASETS AND OVERLAPPING GENETIC INFORMATION CAN HELP IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL LOCI ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISORDER. THUS, THE CANDIDATE PLANS TO USE INTEGRATIVE METHODS TO 1) INCREASE POWER FOR GENETIC DISCOVERY, AND 2) BETTER UNDERSTAND THE GENOMIC ARCHITECTURE FOR AUD. AUD HAS A HIGH GENETIC CORRELATION WITH THE AUDIT-BASED PHENOTYPE (AUDIT-P) WHICH ASSESSES THE PROBLEMATIC CONSEQUENCES OF DRINKING. AUD AND AUDIT-P HAVE SIMILAR GENETIC CORRELATIONS WITH OTHER NPDS. MULTIPLE AUDIT-P DATASETS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, AND A RECENT META-ANALYSIS OF AUD AND AUDIT-P DATASETS SHOWS INCREASED STATISTICAL POWER FOR RISK LOCI IDENTIFICATION. FOR THIS REASON, THIS PROPOSAL CENTERS ON IDENTIFYING THE GENOMIC ASSOCIATION FOR PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE WHICH INCLUDES AUD ITSELF AND/OR AUDIT-P. TO ACHIEVE THIS RESEARCH GOAL, THE CANDIDATE PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING AIMS. FIRST, HE PLANS TO EXTEND HIS PREVIOUS METHODS TO JOINTLY ANALYZE RARE EXONIC VARIANTS AND OTHER OMICS DATASETS. SECOND, HE WILL DEVELOP METHODS TO INTEGRATE COMMON VARIANTS, OMICS INFORMATION AND GENETIC OVERLAP INFORMATION TO INCREASE POWER FOR MULTI-TRAIT ANALYSIS. THIRD, HE PROPOSES AN INTEGRATIVE METHOD TO ANALYZE RARE VARIANTS FROM WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING DATA. FOURTH, HE WILL APPLY THESE METHODS TO ANALYZE LARGE-SCALE VARIANT AND FUNCTIONAL-GENOMIC DATASETS. HE PLANS TO USE SYSTEMS BIOLOGY APPROACHES TO ELUCIDATE ANALYSIS RESULTS FROM THESE METHODS. ALSO, HE PROPOSES USING GENETIC MODEL ORGANISMS (C. ELEGANS) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS FROM COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES VIA RNA INTERFERENCE AND CRISPR-CAS9 EXPERIMENTS. DR. NGUYEN HAS A BACKGROUND IN MATHEMATICS, STATISTICS AND STATISTICAL GENETICS; HOWEVER, HE HAS NOT HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD OF GENETICS OF AUD. THE MENTOR TEAM INCLUDING LEADING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD WILL HELP HIM TO 1) GAIN EXPERTISE IN THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, ALCOHOL RELATED PHENOTYPES, THE NOSOLOGY OF NPDS AND ALCOHOL RELATED PHENOTYPES; 2) ACQUIRE UNDERSTANDING OF GENETIC MODEL ORGANISMS, RNAI AND CRISPR-CAS9 EXPERIMENTS FOR VALIDATION OF COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS; 3) GAIN EXPERTISE IN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF OMICS DATA; AND 4) DEVELOP NEEDED INDEPENDENCE IN HIS CAREER.

JAMES J. PRISCIANDARO IS A LICENSED CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN THE ADDICTION SCIENCES DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY & BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AT THE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA (MUSC), WHO IS COMMITTED TO MAKING A MEASURABLE IMPACT ON OUR UNDERSTANDING AND ABILITY TO TREAT INDIVIDUALS WITH BIPOLAR (BD) AND/OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS (SUD) THROUGH HIS PROGRAM OF PATIENT-ORIENTED RESEARCH (POR). DR. PRISCIANDARO HAS SERVED AS PI, CO-PI, OR CO-I ON 12 NIH-FUNDED GRANT AWARDS SINCE JOINING MUSC IN 2009, BUT HIS SUCCESS IN DESIGNING AND EXECUTING NIH-FUNDED RESEARCH STUDIES HAS COME AT A SIGNIFICANT COST: HIS EFFORTS TO MENTOR NEW CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN GREATLY LIMITED BY HIS EMPLOYMENT WITHIN AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER THAT IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE FACULTY WITH PROTECTED TIME FOR MENTORING OR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AS A RESULT OF THIS LACK OF SUPPORT, DR. PRISCIANDARO HAS HAD TO GREATLY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF NEW CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS THAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO MENTOR, AND HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND HIS METHODOLOGICAL SKILLSET SINCE COMPLETING HIS K23 TRAINING 5-YEARS AGO. THE PROPOSED K24 AWARD WOULD ALLOW DR. PRISCIANDARO TO FULFIL HIS CAREER GOALS BY PROVIDING HIM WITH THE PROTECTED TIME AND SUPPLEMENTARY FUNDING NEEDED TO COMPREHENSIVELY TRAIN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NEW CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS AND TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND HIS METHODOLOGICAL SKILLS IN MRI AND STATISTICS TO INCLUDE GENOMICS. TOWARDS THIS END, DR. PRISCIANDARO HAS RECRUITED SEVERAL CONSULTANTS AND COLLABORATORS TO HELP HIM CREATE, EXECUTE, AND MONITOR A COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PLAN, INCLUDING LONGSTANDING COLLABORATORS WITHIN HIS FIELDS OF EXPERTISE (DRS. RICHARD EDDEN [MRI] AND MICHAELA HOFFMAN [BIOSTATISTICS]) ALONG WITH THREE NEW CONSULTANTS/COLLABORATORS, DRS. ANANDA AMSTADTER (PSYCHIATRIC GENOMICS), STEFANO BERTO (GENOMICS AND BIOINFORMATICS), AND ZHEWU WANG (PSYCHIATRIC GENETICS). WITH THEIR GUIDANCE, DR. PRISCIANDARO HAS PROPOSED A RESEARCH STRATEGY TO APPLY CUTTING-EDGE GENOMICS METHODS TO BLOOD SAMPLES THAT HE HAS COLLECTED FROM EVERY PARTICIPANT ENROLLED IN EACH OF HIS NIH-FUNDED STUDIES TO DATE, STARTING WITH THOSE FROM HIS K23 STUDY; A 2*2 FACTORIAL (BD*ALCOHOL USE DISORDER [AUD]), MULTIMODAL-MRI INVESTIGATION OF NEUROCHEMICAL (I.E., GABA AND GLUTAMATE LEVELS) AND NEUROBEHAVIORAL OVERLAP (I.E., ACTIVATION TO ALCOHOL CUES AND RESPONSE INHIBITION) BETWEEN BD AND AUD. DR. PRISCIANDARO WILL DEVOTE THE REMAINDER OF HIS EFFORT TO HIS CURRENT NIH-FUNDED PROGRAM OF POR, FOCUSED ON PHARMACOLOGICALLY-MANIPULATING INTERMEDIATE MRI PHENOTYPES OF BD AND/OR SUD, WHICH IS TIGHTLY ALIGNED WITH HIS CAREER GOALS AND A RICH SOURCE FOR MENTEE TRAINING AND PRODUCTIVITY.

GLOBALLY ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS (AUD) WERE ATTRIBUTED TO 99.2 MILLION DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (DALYS) WHILE ILLICIT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS (SUD) WERE ATTRIBUTED TO 31.8 MILLION DALYS LOST IN 2016. DESPITE THE URGENT NEED TO REDUCE THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF ASUD AND SCALE UP EFFICACIOUS INTERVENTIONS, TREATMENT UPTAKE WORLDWIDE REMAINS LOW. PSYCHOSOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL FACTORS ARE MAJOR BARRIERS TO ASUD TREATMENT AND ENGAGEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, POLYSUBSTANCE USE, HOMELESSNESS, INCARCERATION, AND ENGAGEMENT IN SEX WORK HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER ASUD TREATMENT COVERAGE AND COMPLETION. WHEN THESE FACTORS CO-OCCUR, THEY MAY ALSO GENERATE SYNERGISTIC NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO LESS OPTIMAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND GREATER DISEASE BURDEN (DEFINED AS SYNDEMICS). LESS RESEARCH HAS EMPIRICALLY EXAMINED THE SYNDEMIC EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS ON ASUD TREATMENT AND TREATMENT ENGAGEMENT. TO OPTIMIZE ASUD TREATMENTS AND MAXIMIZE ENGAGEMENT, THERE\u2019S AN URGENT NEED TO EXAMINE THE SYNDEMIC RELATIONSHIP OF THESE CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY ACROSS MULTIPLE AND DIVERSE STUDIES. TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS, DR. SANTOS PROPOSES TO EXPAND HIS PATIENT ORIENTED RESEARCH (POR) PROGRAM, AND EXPAND HIS CAPACITY TO TRAIN EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATORS (ESIS), PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS. DR.

PROJECT B WILL EXAMINE THE SYNDEMIC EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS ON ASUD TREATMENT OUTCOMES (AIM 3), AND THE MODERATORS OF THOSE EFFECTS (AIM 4), LEVERAGING 10 ASUD PHARMACOTHERAPY TRIALS (CUMULATIVE N=722), ALSO USING AN IDA APPROACH. PROJECT C WILL EXAMINE THE PREFERRED TREATMENT ATTRIBUTES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH ASUD USING DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENTS (DCE; AIM 5) AND EXAMINE HOW PREFERENCES DIFFER BETWEEN GROUPS (AIM 6) AMONG 250 INDIVIDUALS WITH ASUD. ULTIMATELY, THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY WILL BE FILL CRITICAL GAPS IN ASUD TREATMENT IMPLEMENTATION, PARTICULARLY FOR KEY POPULATIONS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY HIV. IN PARALLEL TO THESE RESEARCH PROJECTS, DR. SANTOS WILL PROVIDE STRUCTURED MENTORING AND TRAINING TO ESIS IN THREE KEY AREAS OF SUPPORT: INSTRUMENTAL, PROFESSIONAL AND SOCIAL.

THE STANDARD CARE FOR A SUICIDE CRISIS, INCLUDING FOR PERSONS WHO MISUSE ALCOHOL, IS ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION. ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION FOCUSES ON STABILIZATION AND CRISIS RESOLUTION PRIOR TO QUICKLY DISCHARGING AT-RISK PATIENTS BACK INTO THEIR STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENTS WITH A REFERRAL FOR OUTPATIENT CARE. OUTPATIENT- BASED INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON EMOTION REGULATION TRAINING HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCE ALCOHOL MISUSE AND SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR. YET, LESS THAN 50% OF PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENTS FOLLOW THROUGH WITH OUTPATIENT TREATMENT, WHICH CREATES A DANGEROUS GAP IN CARE; RISK FOR SUICIDE IS THE HIGHEST AMONG RECENTLY DISCHARGING PATIENTS WHO MISUSE ALCOHOL. THIS MENTORED PATIENT-ORIENTED RESEARCH CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD (K23) INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION TO (1) ENHANCE STANDARD CARE FOR AT-RISK PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENTS WHO MISUSE ALCOHOL, AND (2) CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SUSTAINED RECOVERY AND REDUCED RISK FOR A SUBSEQUENT SUICIDE CRISIS DURING THE POST-DISCHARGE PERIOD.

THE RESEARCH PLAN FOR THIS K23 HAS TWO PHASES: DEVELOPMENT (PHASE 1: AIMS 1 AND 2) AND EVALUATION OF FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF MSTARS (PHASE 2: AIM 3). TO INFORM MHEALTH APP DEVELOPMENT, WE WILL CONDUCT A 6-WEEK ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA) STUDY ON SUICIDAL PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENTS WHO MISUSE ALCOHOL (N = 35) TO ELUCIDATE TIME-VARYING PREDICTORS FOR ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND SUICIDAL IDEATION, AND EXAMINE THE ROLE OF SPECIFIC EMOTION REGULATION DEFICITS.

AIM 2 IS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE RESULTING INTERVENTION AMONG HEAVY EPISODIC DRINKERS (N=70) WITH ADHD, HALF RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THE INTERVENTION AND HALF TO AN ALCOHOL MONITORING CONTROL CONDITION FOR 3 WEEKS (STUDY 2). THE UTILITY OF PASSIVELY SENSED SMARTPHONE INDICES OF INHIBITORY CONTROL (E.G., SCREEN UNLOCK RATE) WILL BE EXPLORED TO INFORM FUTURE PERSONALIZATION. AIM 3 IS TO TEST PRELIMINARY INTERVENTION EFFECTS, INCLUDING DYNAMIC TRANSACTIONS AMONG ALCOHOL USE, INHIBITORY CONTROL, AND LIFE IMPAIRMENTS. THIS INNOVATIVE, SCALABLE INTERVENTION ADDRESSES A CRITICAL NEED TO HELP YOUNG ADULTS WITH ADHD CURB PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE. OUTCOMES WILL LEAD TO A FUTURE FULLY-POWERED EFFICACY TRIAL. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND TRAINING (DIDACTICS, CONFERENCES, MENTOR-DIRECTED TRAINING) WILL EQUIP THE PI WITH THE REQUISITE SKILLS TO LAUNCH AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH CAREER IN ALCOHOL INTERVENTIONS: COMPETENCE IN MOMENTARY DRINKING CAPTURE; EXPERTISE IN INTERVENTION SCIENCE FOCUSED ON MHEALTH; AND IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF INHIBITORY CONTROL.

JONATHAN WAI PROPOSES A COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL STUDY AND TRAINING PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER WITH EXPERTISE IN DEVICE-BASED TREATMENTS AND NEUROIMAGING FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD). THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (RTMS) ON ALCOHOL SELF-ADMINISTRATION AND IN VIVO BRAIN GABA LEVELS IN NON-TREATMENT SEEKING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS WITH AUD. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AUD IS ASSOCIATED WITH BROAD DYSFUNCTION IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTICES, AS WELL AS DECREASED PREFRONTAL GABA CONCENTRATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, RTMS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE PREFRONTAL GABA IN TREATMENT STUDIES WITH DEPRESSED PATIENTS, WITH THE INCREASE IN GABA ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT. EARLY WORK USING RTMS FOR AUD HAS SHOWN THAT RTMS CAN DECREASE CRAVING AND REPORTED ALCOHOL USE. THUS, RTMS TO THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX MAY SERVE AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR AUD, EITHER ALONE OR AS AN ADJUNCT TO EXISTING TREATMENTS. WE PLAN TO CONDUCT TWO SHAM-CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-BLINDED, RANDOMIZED HUMAN LABORATORY ALCOHOL SELF- ADMINISTRATION STUDIES DURING THE AWARD PERIOD. FOR STUDY 1, AUD PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ADMITTED TO A RESEARCH UNIT AND RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE ACTIVE (N=22) OR SHAM (N=22) RTMS. PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE AN ALCOHOL SELF- ADMINISTRATION SESSION AND NEUROIMAGING WITH MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY (MRS) BEFORE AND AFTER THREE WEEKS OF RTMS.

THESE CONFLICTING PATTERNS MAY BE PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT THE POTENCY OF DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC; THE MAIN PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOID IN CANNABIS) IN CANNABIS IN THE U.S. VARIES WIDELY, WITH LEGAL-MARKET CANNABIS CONTAINING INCREASINGLY HIGHER THC POTENCIES. WHEN COMBINED WITH ALCOHOL, CANNABIS MAY CONFER EITHER SYNERGISTIC OR MITIGATING EFFECTS ON CRAVING, IMPULSIVITY, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND SUBSEQUENT DRINKING, LIKELY DEPENDING ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CANNABINOID DOSE AND CONTENT. THE LIMITED LITERATURE IN THIS AREA HAS GENERATED CONFLICTING FINDINGS; SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THC INCREASES ALCOHOL INTAKE AND HAS SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS ON THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL, AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THC DECREASES ALCOHOL INTAKE OR HAS NO EFFECTS ON THESE OUTCOMES. EMERGING WORK ALSO SUGGESTS THAT ALCOHOL AND CANNABIS EXERT OPPOSING EFFECTS ON THE DIGESTIVE, IMMUNE, AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS, COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS THE MICROBIOTA-GUT-BRAIN-AXIS (MGBA). ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION AND DISTURBANCES IN GUT MICROBIAL SPECIES (MICROBIOTA), AND THESE MGBA DISRUPTIONS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROBEHAVIORAL AUD SYMPTOMS (E.G., CRAVING, IMPAIRED CONTROL). CONVERSELY, PRECLINICAL DATA SUGGEST THAT CANNABINOIDS MAY CONFER BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON ASPECTS OF THE MGBA. THE OPPOSING FINDINGS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF CANNABIS ON ALCOHOL USE MAY BE PARTIALLY DUE TO THE DIFFERENTIAL ACTIONS OF CANNABINOIDS THROUGHOUT THE MGBA, WHICH NEED TO BE BETTER CHARACTERIZED IN HUMANS. THUS, THE GOAL OF THIS NATURALISTIC STUDY IS TO EXPLORE EFFECTS OF LEGAL-MARKET CANNABIS ON ACUTE AND DAILY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, NEUROBEHAVIORAL AUD PHENOTYPES AND MGBA FUNCTION IN HEAVY DRINKERS.

PATHWAY ANALYSIS OF AH LIVER RNA-SEQUENCING SUGGESTS A POTENTIAL ROLE OF IL17 IN MEDIATING LSEC ANGIOCRINE SIGNALING. IL17 IS A CYTOKINE INVOLVED IN MANY AUTOIMMUNE AND INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS THAT IL17 SYNERGICALLY STIMULATE CXCL CHEMOKINE PRODUCTION WITH TNF, BUT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM IS NOT CLEAR. THE REGULATION OF IL17 PRODUCTION FROM T CELLS ALSO REQUIRES FURTHER STUDY. SUPER ENHANCERS ARE DNA REGULATORY ELEMENTS THAT COMPLEX WITH TARGET GENE PROMOTERS TO DRIVE GENE EXPRESSION. OUR PREVIOUS WORK HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF SUPER ENHANCERS IN AH INFLAMMATION RESPONSE.

PLACENTAL INSUFFICIENCY (PI) OCCURS IN AS MANY AS 6% OF PREGNANCIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CAN RESULT IN NEURODEVELOPMENTAL ABNORMALITIES. HEAVY PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE) INCREASES RATES OF PLACENTAL DYSFUNCTION, BUT THE IMPACT FOLLOWING MODERATE PAE IS LESS CLEAR.

SKELETAL MUSCLE LOSS OR SARCOPENIA IS A CONSISTENT ABNORMALITY IN PATIENTS WITH ALD AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE CLINICAL OUTCOMES THAT INCLUDE INCREASED MORTALITY, OTHER COMPLICATIONS OF LIVER DISEASE AND POOR POST-LIVER TRANSPLANT OUTCOMES. WE HAVE RECENTLY REPORTED MORE SEVERE MUSCLE LOSS AND A GREATER RATE OF MUSCLE LOSS IN PATIENTS WITH ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS COMPARED WITH THOSE IN OTHER CAUSES OF CIRRHOSIS. DESPITE THE HIGH CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SARCOPENIA IN ALD THERE ARE NO EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD.

AA METHODS ARE THE LEADING METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH IN THE PUSH TOWARDS PERSONALIZED MEDICINE BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A COMPELLING PLATFORM FOR ASSESSMENT, DIAGNOSIS, REAL-TIME MONITORING, AND JUST-IN-TIME INTERVENTIONS. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT UTILITY OF AA FOR PERSONALIZED MODELS OF AUD RISK IS LIMITED BECAUSE RISKY DRINKING AND THE RISK FACTORS FOR IT (SUCH AS CHANGES IN MOODS, STRESS, OR SOCIAL CONTEXTS) CHANGE AT DIFFERENT SCALES OF TIME. IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN HEAVY DRINKERS MAY ONLY DRINK A FEW TIMES A WEEK, BUT THEIR EMOTIONS, STRESSORS AND SOCIAL CONTEXTS CHANGE MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. CURRENT AA METHODS THAT RELY ON SELF-REPORT DATA HAVE TO SAMPLE FREQUENTLY ENOUGH TO BE SENSITIVE TO CHANGE, LONG ENOUGH TO OBSERVE SUFFICIENT DRINKING EPISODES, AND TO DO SO WHILE AVOIDING PARTICIPANT BURNOUT. PASSIVE MOBILE SENSING, WHICH USES SENSORS (SUCH AS GPS, ACCELEROMETER, LIGHT METER, ETC.) AVAILABLE ON MOST SMARTPHONES, HAS BEEN SHOWN IN PRELIMINARY STUDIES TO PREDICT THE PROBABILITY OF DRINKING EPISODES, BUT THOSE STUDIES HAVE USED RELATIVELY SMALL SAMPLES. THE PRESENT CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD AIMS TO DEVELOP THE CANDIDATE\u2019S EXPERTISE IN PASSIVE MOBILE SENSING AND THE MACHINE LEARNING METHODS USED TO ANALYZE PASSIVE MOBILE SENSING DATA. THE RESEARCH PROPOSAL WILL ANALYZE PASSIVE MOBILE SENSING DATA COLLECTED IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF REGULAR DRINKING AND MARIJUANA USING YOUNG ADULTS (AGE 18 \u2013 22, N = 500; 95.2% WHO DRINK), WHO WILL BE FOLLOWED USING AA OVER 8 SUCCESSIVE WEEKENDS AS PART OF A PARENT R01 (DA 047247). THE RESEARCH GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY PASSIVE MOBILE SENSING MODELS OF RISK FACTORS FOR DRINKING (STRESS, SOCIAL CONTEXTS, SLEEP, MOOD, AND IMPULSIVE STATES), AS WELL AS THE DRINKING EPISODES THEMSELVES. THE CANDIDATE WILL DEVELOP EXPERTISE IN THESE METHODS AND MODELS THAT WILL FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RESEARCH PROGRAM AIMED AT DEVELOPING PERSON SPECIFIC MODELS OF RISK FOR AUD.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8a022699-f7be-356a-f01a-3aa6f76016ef-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K02AA028832_7529"}, {"internal_id": 133585099, "Award ID": "K02AA028630", "Award Amount": 407229.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-10", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "OPTIMIZING BRIEF ALCOHOL INTERVENTIONS FOR YOUNG ADULTS VIA COMPUTATIONAL METHODS - PROJECT SUMMARY THE GOAL OF THIS INDEPENDENT SCIENTIST AWARD (K02) IS TO SEEK \u201cPROTECTED TIME\u201d FOR A PERIOD OF INTENSIVE RESEARCH FOCUS TO ENHANCE THE CANDIDATE\u2019S CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPETING BRIEF ALCOHOL INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR MECHANISMS.

ABSTINENCE PERIODS - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) IN THE U.S. IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. NIAAA RECENTLY PROPOSED AN OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF RECOVERY FROM AUD TO ADVANCE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA, INCLUDING: 1) REMISSION FROM DSM-5 AUD, 2) CESSATION FROM HEAVY DRINKING, AND 3) IMPROVEMENTS IN BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND QUALITY OF LIFE. KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM STUDYING RECOVERY AS OPERATIONALLY DEFINED BY NIAAA USING NOVEL METHODOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL APPROACHES HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO INFORM CLINICAL PRACTICE AND IMPROVE PATIENT CARE FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM AUD. MOST PEOPLE WHO RECOVER FROM AUD NEVER RECEIVE TREATMENT, AND YET VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PROCESS OF \u201cNATURAL\u201d RECOVERY IN THE ABSENCE OF INTERVENTION. VOLUNTARY TEMPORARY ABSTINENCE CAMPAIGNS, SUCH AS \u201cDRY JANUARY\u201d AND \u201cSOBER OCTOBER,\u201d ARE MONTH-LONG PERIODS OF ABSTINENCE FROM ALCOHOL THAT ARE INCREASING IN POPULARITY. AS SELF-INITIATED CHANGE ATTEMPTS FOR A DEFINED PERIOD, THESE CAMPAIGNS PROVIDE A UNIQUE MEANS FOR STUDYING NATURAL AUD RECOVERY. LONGITUDINAL OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES OF VOLUNTARY TEMPORARY ABSTINENCE CAMPAIGNS CAN BE USED TO TEST THEORETICALLY INFORMED PREDICTORS OF RECOVERY DURING AND AFTER PARTICIPATION IN THE CAMPAIGN. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL TEST TWO DISPARATE THEORIES, SELF- DETERMINATION THEORY AND BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIC THEORY, BOTH OF WHICH ARE NOVEL THEORIES OF MECHANISMS UNDERLYING AUD RECOVERY. SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY EXPLAINS BEHAVIOR CHANGE BASED ON INTERNALIZATION OF MOTIVATION, WHEREAS BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIC THEORY EXPLAINS BEHAVIOR CHANGE BASED ON BENEFITS AND COSTS OF COMPETING BEHAVIORS. TESTING BOTH THEORIES WILL PROVIDE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW INDIVIDUALS MAY INITIATE (OR NOT) AND MAINTAIN (OR NOT) SELF-DIRECTED CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR DURING AND FOLLOWING INTENDED PARTICIPATION IN A VOLUNTARY TEMPORARY ABSTINENCE CAMPAIGN. OUR OBJECTIVE IN THIS PROPOSAL IS TO LEVERAGE TWO VOLUNTARY TEMPORARY ABSTINENCE CAMPAIGNS TO COMPREHENSIVELY INVESTIGATE THE TENETS OF SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY AND BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIC THEORY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AUD RECOVERY. WE WILL RECRUIT SEX-BALANCED AND RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE ONLINE SAMPLES WHO MEET CRITERIA FOR PAST-YEAR AUD, ENGAGED IN PAST-MONTH HAZARDOUS DRINKING, AND INTEND TO PARTICIPATE IN EITHER DRY JANUARY (N = 125) OR SOBER OCTOBER (N =125). PARTICIPANTS WILL COMPLETE A BASELINE ASSESSMENT PRIOR TO PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY TEMPORARY ABSTINENCE AND FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS AFTER. THIS INNOVATIVE DESIGN WILL ALLOW US TO EXAMINE NATURAL AUD RECOVERY, AS DEFINED BY NIAAA, IN THE CONTEXT OF VOLUNTARY TEMPORARY ABSTINENCE CAMPAIGNS (AIM 1), AND TO TEST THE PROCESSES OF RECOVERY DESCRIBED BY SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY (AIM 2) AND BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIC THEORY (AIM 3).

ALCOHOL ABUSE CAN RESULT IN ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE, AND EVEN CIRRHOSIS, AS THE MAJORITY OF ALCOHOL IS METABOLIZED BY THE LIVER DURING FIRST PASS METABOLISM. ALCOHOL IS PRIMARILY METABOLIZED IN THE LIVER THROUGH TWO ENZYMATIC REACTIONS (ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE AND ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 2) THAT EACH REDUCE AN NAD+ TO NADH, CONTRIBUTING TO A REDUCED REDOX STATE. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION REDUCES THE REDOX STATE (GREATER NADH/ NAD+ RATIO) WHICH MAY IMPAIR SS-OXIDATION AND THE TCA CYCLE. THESE FACTORS MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN FATTY ACID OXIDATION AND THE ACCUMULATION OF LIPIDS. METABOLIC MECHANISMS IN THE LIVER MAY ALSO USE ACETATE AS SUBSTRATE TO CONTRIBUTE TO DE NOVO LIPOGENESIS, FURTHER CONTRIBUTING TO ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE. HOWEVER, AS MUCH AS 80% OF THE ACETATE PRODUCED DURING ALCOHOL METABOLISM ESCAPES THE LIVER AND CAN BE USED BY PERIPHERAL TISSUES OR ORGANS SUCH AS THE HEART. THE HEART IS ALSO SEVERELY AFFECTED BY ALCOHOL ABUSE, WHICH CAN LEAD TO CARDIAC DYSFUNCTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, SUCH AS ALCOHOLIC CARDIOMYOPATHY. IN THE HEART, ACETATE INTERFERES WITH FATTY ACID OXIDATION, WHICH RESULTS IN LOWER ATP CONCENTRATIONS, AS WELL AS THE ACCUMULATION OF TRIGLYCERIDES. ACETATE MAY IMPAIR THE OXIDATION OF FREE FATTY ACIDS (FFAS) AS FUEL, NOT THROUGH THE INHIBITION OF CPT VIA MALONYL-COA PRODUCTION, BUT BY METABOLIC MECHANISMS OUTCOMPETING CPT FOR FREE COAS THEREFORE RESULTING IN THE LIMITATION OF FFAS ENTRY INTO THE MITOCHONDRIA FOR OXIDATION. ADMINISTERING ACETATE IN IN VITRO (HEART PERFUSIONS) AND IN VIVO INFUSION EXPERIMENTS RESULTS IN AN ENERGY DEFICIT THROUGH A MECHANISM THAT HAS YET TO BE ELUCIDATED.

GIVEN THAT HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMPOUNDED EXPOSURE TO ADVERSITY BEGINNING IN CHILDHOOD, INVESTIGATING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) AND AU AND RELATED PROBLEMS IN ADOLESCENCE IS CRITICAL. WE WILL CONSIDER BOTH THE RISK AND PROTECTIVE ROLE OF SOCIO-CULTURAL FACTORS (E.G., DISCRIMINATION VS.

I WILL EXAMINE THE STABILITY OF THESE BIOTYPES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN, INCLUDING AMONG SUBSTANCE-NA\u00cfVE CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH HEAVY ALCOHOL USE, AS WELL AS THEIR CORRELATES WITH NEUROBEHAVIORAL STAGE-BASED CONSTRUCTS OF ADDICTION (I.E., IMPULSIVITY, NEGATIVE AFFECT, COGNITION) AND WITH ALCOHOL INVOLVEMENT TRAJECTORIES. I WILL THEN CONDUCT A GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDY OF AUD BIOTYPES TO DISARTICULATE THEIR GENETIC ARCHITECTURE, GENETIC CORRELATES, AND POTENTIAL MOLECULAR PATHWAYS THAT MAY BE LEVERAGED FOR DRUG REPOSITIONING. THIS GRANT DEVELOPS MY SKILLSETS IN SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING, AUD HETEROGENEOUS PRESENTATIONS, MULTIVARIATE GENOME-WIDE METHODS, AND MULTI-OMIC ANALYTIC APPROACHES.

AUD IS A CHRONIC RELAPSING DISEASE WITH A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT. WHILE SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE TO UNDERSTAND THE NEURAL CIRCUITRY UNDERLYING AUD, THE ROLE OF THE PERIPHERY AND THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE PERIPHERY AND THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM HAVE BEEN UNDERSTUDIED. ONE PROMISING AVENUE OF STUDY IS THE GUT MICROBIOME AND THE MICROBIOTA-GUT-BRAIN AXIS, WHICH HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEEN RECOGNIZED AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF AUD. DESPITE THE PROMISE OF THE MICROBIOTA-GUT-BRAIN AXIS AS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO AUD, THERE HAVE BEEN NO COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE MICROBIOTA-GUT-BRAIN AXIS IN A SINGLE SAMPLE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AUD. THEREFORE, THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GUT DYSBIOSIS, CLINICAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF AUD, AND A BRAIN-BASED BIOMARKER IN INDIVIDUALS WITH AUD AND MATCHED CONTROLS. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE OF THIS K01 APPLICATION IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE MICROBIOME-GUT-BRAIN AXIS ACROSS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ANALYSIS. SPECIFICALLY, 64 INDIVIDUALS WITH AUD AND 64 MATCHED HEALTHY CONTROLS WILL PROVIDE A FECAL SAMPLE TO LOCALIZE THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC ALCOHOL USE ON THE GUT MICROBIOME.

THIS GOAL WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A 5-YEAR PARALLEL RESEARCH AND TAILORED TRAINING PLAN. TRAINING GOALS INCLUDE BUILDING EXPERTISE IN (1) CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE OF ALCOHOL USE; (2) EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING (EF) AND ATTENTION- DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD); (3) ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA); (4) ADVANCED LONGITUDINAL DATA ANALYSES; AND (5) GRANTSMANSHIP.

LYNDA STEIN (EXPERT IN ALCOHOL INTERVENTIONS), LISA WEYANDT (EXPERT IN ADHD), KRISTINA JACKSON (EXPERT IN EMA METHODS AND ANALYSES), AND TIMOTHY WILENS (EXPERT IN ADHD AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS); WORKSHOPS; CONFERENCES; COURSEWORK; AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. SKILLS GAINED THROUGH THE TRAINING PLAN WILL BE PUT INTO ACTION THROUGH A COMPLEMENTARY RESEARCH PLAN AIMED TO UNDERSTAND THE ALCOHOL- RISK PROCESS OF YOUNG ADULT DRINKERS WITH ADHD. YOUNG ADULTS WITH ADHD ARE AT GREATER RISK FOR EXPERIENCING ALCOHOL PROBLEMS (E.G., RISKY SEX, DRIVING AFTER DRINKING) AND DEVELOPING ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT ADHD. HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHY THOSE WITH ADHD ARE AT GREATER RISK BECAUSE RESEARCH SUPPORTS THAT THEY DRINK LESS THAN OR EQUIVALENT TO THEIR NON-ADHD PEERS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL STUDY THIS DISCREPANCY BY UTILIZING A MEASUREMENT-BURST DESIGN PAIRING LABORATORY AND EMA TO EXAMINE CONTROLLED (EF) AND AUTOMATIC (CRAVING) PROCESSES IN RELATION TO ALCOHOL USE AMONG THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT ADHD. PARTICIPANTS (STRATIFIED BY ADHD AND GENDER) WILL BE 141 YOUNG ADULT DRINKERS WHO COMPLETE THREE BURSTS OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD (BASELINE, 6-MONTHS, AND 12-MONTHS). EACH TIMEPOINT WILL INCLUDE A LABORATORY SESSION ASSESSING EF FOLLOWED BY 17 DAYS OF EMA ASSESSING CRAVING, ALCOHOL USE, ALCOHOL PROBLEMS, CONTEXT, AND SOCIAL SETTING. THE PROPOSED PROJECT HAS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF ADHD ON EF AND ALCOHOL OUTCOMES (CRAVING, ALCOHOL USE, AND ALCOHOL PROBLEMS) AT BASELINE; (2) DETERMINE WITHIN-PERSON CHANGES BETWEEN EF AND ALCOHOL OUTCOMES OVER ONE YEAR FOR THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT ADHD; (3) IDENTIFY EVENT-LEVEL PREDICTORS (CONTEXT, SOCIAL SETTING) THAT HEIGHTEN CRAVING, ALCOHOL USE, AND ALCOHOL PROBLEMS FOR THOSE WITH ADHD.

COMORBIDITY OF DISEASE POSES A CHALLENGE TO BOTH THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF AUD, BUT THE ETIOLOGIC FACTORS UNDERLYING COMORBIDITY ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. RECENT LARGE-SCALE GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWAS) HAVE IDENTIFIED COMMON RISK MARKERS FOR AUD AND SEVERAL OTHER TRAITS. GENETIC CORRELATIONS BETWEEN AUD AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS HAVE IDENTIFIED GENETIC OVERLAP ACROSS MULTIPLE LOCI. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE COMMON LOCI OR BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS THAT INCREASE RISK FOR MULTIPLE DISORDERS. IDENTIFYING THESE LOCI WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE ETIOLOGIC PATHWAYS FOR COMORBID DISORDERS, AND COULD ADVANCE EFFORTS TO ACCURATELY DIAGNOSE, CATEGORIZE, PREVENT, AND TREAT AUD AND CO-OCCURRING MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS. RESEARCH TO DATE HAS BEEN LIMITED BY THE LACK OF RESOURCES WITH WELL CHARACTERIZED PHENOTYPIC INFORMATION ALONGSIDE GENETIC DATA FOR LARGE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS. THE PROJECT PROPOSED IN THIS K-AWARD APPLICATION USES INFORMATION COLLECTED WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW SCHEDULE IN A SAMPLE OF >15,000 INDIVIDUALS ENRICHED FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS TO CREATE A MULTI-PHENOTYPE DATASET FOR PHENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS. POLYGENIC RISK SCORES FOR THE SAME SET OF INDIVIDUALS WILL BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE GENETIC LIABILITY FOR DISEASE. WE WILL: 1) IDENTIFY PHENOTYPES ASSOCIATED WITH GENETIC LIABILITY FOR AUD; 2) IDENTIFY WHETHER GENETIC LIABILITY FOR OTHER TRAITS IS ASSOCIATED WITH AUD; 3) INCORPORATE BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY PATHWAYS THAT UNDERLIE COMORBID RISK; AND 4) INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS TO TEST FOR GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS.

JOSHUA WALLACH, AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AT THE YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, WITH THE PROTECTED TIME NECESSARY TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT EXPERT IN SYNTHESIZING, EVALUATING, AND ESTABLISHING THE BEST EVIDENCE TO INFORM CLINICAL PRACTICE IN THE FIELD OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD). ALTHOUGH AUD IS A COMMON AND MORBID DISEASE, FOR WHICH MEDICATION TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE, UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT WHETHER AND FOR WHOM TREATMENTS WORK MAY BE CAUSING AUD MEDICATION UNDERUTILIZATION. TO ADVANCE THE EVIDENCE BASE TO SUPPORT AUD MEDICATION TREATMENT, RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY PATIENT SUBGROUPS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM EACH MEDICATION USED TO TREAT AUD. HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL SUBGROUP ANALYSES OFTEN CONSIDER ONLY ONE PATIENT CHARACTERISTIC AT A TIME AND ARE CONDUCTED IN SMALL CLINICAL TRIALS WITH STRICT EXCLUSION CRITERIA, SHORT DURATIONS, AND OUTCOMES THAT MAY NOT REFLECT HOW PATIENTS FEEL OR FUNCTION. THIS PROPOSED K01 WILL ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS BY CONDUCTING SUBGROUP ANALYSES USING MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES, OUTCOMES, AND ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES. IN AIM 1, DR. WALLACH WILL IDENTIFY AND ASSESS THE VALIDITY OF ALREADY PUBLISHED SUBGROUP ANALYSES TO ESTABLISH PROMISING PATIENT SUBGROUPS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM EACH MEDICATION USED TO TREAT AUD. IN AIM 2, EXISTING DATA FROM THE LARGEST AUD TRIAL IN THE US (THE COMBINE STUDY) WILL BE USED TO (A) CORROBORATE PROMISING PATIENT SUBGROUP DIFFERENCES IDENTIFIED IN AIM 1 AND (B) EXPLORE NEW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PATIENT SUBGROUPS, USING MULTIPLE METHODS (I.E. TRADITIONAL AND STATISTICAL LEARNING, WHICH CAN CONSIDER MULTIPLE CHARACTERISTICS) AND OUTCOME MEASURES (ABSTINENCE, HEAVY DRINKING, AND 2-SHIFT REDUCTION IN WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DRINKING LEVELS). IN AIM 3, CLAIMS DATA FROM OPTUMLABS, A DATABASE OF OVER 150 MILLION PRIVATELY INSURED AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE ENROLLEES, WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SAME, SIMILAR, OR NEW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PATIENT SUBGROUPS ARE OBSERVED IN REAL-WORLD SETTINGS WHEN HOSPITAL AND AMBULATORY CARE OUTCOMES ARE CONSIDERED. THESE AIMS WILL CLARIFY UNCERTAINTIES AMONG PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS REGARDING THE ADOPTION OF AUD MEDICATIONS, WHICH CAN DECREASE THE PUBLIC HEALTH BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH AUD. TO SUPPORT THESE AIMS, DR. WALLACH\u2019S CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN WILL INCLUDE TRAINING IN: (1) AUD MEDICATIONS AND ADDICTION MEDICINE, (2) NOVEL STATISTICAL LEARNING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED TO INFORM INDIVIDUALIZED CLINICAL DECISION MAKING, AND (3) PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH METHODS FOR REAL-WORLD MEDICAL PRODUCT EVALUATION.

MOOD, COGNITION, AND OTHER PROCESSES ARE REGULATED BY ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (ER) A NEURONS. FEMALE HAVE INCREASED NUMBER OF ERA NEURONS IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS, COMPARED TO MALES. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SEX DIFFERENCE IN NEUROCHEMICAL PHENOTYPE, THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF SEX DIFFERENCE IN THE BRAIN. DESPITE THIS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ON THE MECHANISMS CONTROLLING THEIR DEVELOPMENT.  OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS UNDERLIE SEX DIFFERENCES IN NEUROCHEMICAL PHENOTYPE THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO SEX BIASES IN DISEASE. INHIBITING DNA METHYLATION IN THE BRAINS OF NEWBORN MICE REDUCES SEX DIFFERENCES IN ERA IN THE PREOPTIC AREA (POA) AND THE VENTROLATERAL AREA OF THE VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMUS (VMHVL) AT WEANING. WE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT DNA METHYLTRANSFERASES (DNMTS; WHICH ADD METHYL MARKS) AND TEN ELEVEN TRANSLOCASES (TETS; WHICH REMOVE METHYL MARKS), PEAK SHORTLY AFTER BIRTH IN BOTH SEXES IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS. ADDITIONALLY, FEMALES HAVE HIGHER EXPRESSION OF DNMTS, WHILE MALES HAVE HIGHER EXPRESSION OF TETS DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS SUGGESTS THAT DNA METHYLATION AND HYDROXYMETHYLATION ARE DYNAMIC AND SEX- BIASED DURING NEONATAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. INTERESTINGLY, BOTH SEXES HAVE AN EQUALLY HIGH NUMBER OF ERA CELLS IN THE VMHVL AT BIRTH, BUT ONLY IN MALES, IT DECREASES 50% BY WEANING. THIS PROPOSAL WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ERA CELLS IN MALES, BUT NOT FEMALES, ACCUMULATE DNA METHYLATION MARKS DURING POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH ESTABLISHES THE SEX DIFFERENCE. THE F99 PHASE WILL TEST 1) WHETHER SUB-POPULATIONS OF ERA CELLS WITH FUNCTIONAL ROLES ARE SENSITIVE TO NEONATAL INHIBITION OF DNA METHYLATION USING SINGLE-MOLECULE FLUORESCENT IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION AND 2) WHETHER SPECIFIC SUB-POPULATIONS DOWN-REGULATE ERA EXPRESSION ACROSS DEVELOPMENT (AIM 2A).

THIS PROJECT WILL (1) DETERMINE WHETHER MATERNAL NUTRIENT STATUS MEDIATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALCOHOL EXPOSURE AND CHILD GROWTH, DYSMORPHOLOGY, AND NEUROCOGNITIVE OUTCOMES; (2) DEVELOP A POLYGENIC RISK SCORE ASSOCIATED WITH FASD DIAGNOSIS; AND (3) DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS A CHOLINE-RELATED DIET-BY-GENE INTERACTION WHICH PARTIALLY EXPLAINS THE SUSCEPTIBILITY AND SEVERITY OF AN FASD DIAGNOSIS. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE TRAINING PLAN INCLUDE ADVANCED INSTRUCTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NUTRIGENOMIC THEORY AND APPLIED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. SPECIFIC SKILLS TO BE MASTERED DURING THIS FELLOWSHIP INCLUDE: (1) QUANTITATIVE ANALYTIC SKILLS IN THE GENETICS OF COMPLEX DISEASES; (2) ADVANCED TRAINING IN NUTRIGENETICS DATA ANALYSIS; AND (3) ENHANCEMENT OF LEADERSHIP AND GRANTSMANSHIP SKILLS. THE PROPOSED FELLOWSHIP WILL ENABLE THESE GOALS THROUGH CAREFULLY SELECTED COURSEWORK, RESEARCH EXPERIENCES, SEMINARS, AND WORKSHOPS. COLLECTIVELY, THESE WILL PROVIDE AN UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN THE ADVANCED SKILLS BEFORE APPLYING THE METHODS AND TECHNIQUES TO IMPORTANT, YET LARGELY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ETIOLOGY OF FASD.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PLAN WILL FACILITATE THE APPLICANT'S TRANSITION INTO AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR BY ESTABLISH THE APPLICANT'S EXPERTISE IN GENETICS AND NUTRIGENETIC ANALYSIS AND APPLYING THIS EXPERTISE TO DETERMINING NUTRITIONAL, GENETIC, NUTRIGENETIC INFLUENCES ON THE SUSCEPTIBILITY AND SEVERITY OF AN FASD DIAGNOSIS, AN AREA OF RESEARCH REMAINS VASTLY UNCHARACTERIZED WITHIN THE FIELD OF FASD.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f371179b-9f27-8013-f81c-4fd314b1f981-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F32AA030495_7529"}, {"internal_id": 148732834, "Award ID": "F32AA030494", "Award Amount": 139374.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-05-11", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "ROLE OF NOCICEPTIN-CONTAINING NEURONS OF THE LATERAL SEPTUM IN BINGE-LIKE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION - PROJECT SUMMARY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HAD A PALPABLE IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH, AND MALADAPTIVE COPING STRATEGIES, SUCH AS EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, HAVE SEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN RECENT YEARS. BINGE DRINKING IS THE MOST COMMON PATTERN OF EXCESSIVE DRINKING BEHAVIOR AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD). PRESENTLY, PHARMACOTHERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF AUD ARE LIMITED, CREATING A PRESSING NEED FOR NOVEL THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS. A MORE THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT GOVERN EXCESSIVE, UNCONTROLLED ALCOHOL DRINKING IS NECESSARY TO MEET THIS GOAL. THE DRINKING IN THE DARK (DID) MODEL SERVES AS A ROBUST AND REPRODUCIBLE PLATFORM FOR MOLECULAR AND CIRCUIT LEVEL INTERROGATION OF SYSTEMS THAT PROMOTE BINGE-LIKE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. THE ENDOGENOUS OPIOID-LIKE PEPTIDE NOCICEPTIN/ORPHANIN FQ (N/OFQ) AND THE NOCICEPTIN RECEPTOR (NOP) IS ONE MOLECULAR TARGET OF INTEREST AND SELECTIVE NOP ANTAGONISTS HAVE SHOWN GREAT PROMISE IN ATTENUATING EXCESSIVE DRINKING BEHAVIOR. FOR EXAMPLE, A NOP ANTAGONIST WAS FOUND TO DECREASE NUMBER OF HEAVY DRINKING DAYS AND AMOUNT CONSUMED PER WEEK IN TREATMENT-SEEKING PATIENTS WITH AN AUD. MY PRELIMINARY RESULTS SUPPORT THIS THERAPEUTIC TARGET IN THAT A NOP ANTAGONIST DECREASED ALCOHOL INTAKE IN THE DID MODEL, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LITERATURE. TOGETHER, THESE FINDINGS POINT TO NOP AS A CLEAR CANDIDATE FOR AUD PHARMACOTHERAPIES, AND YET NO STUDIES TO DATE HAVE EXPLORED THE ENDOGENOUS N/OFQ POPULATIONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN ALCOHOL DRINKING BEHAVIOR AND ONLY ONE HAS PROBED THE SITE OF NOP ACTION. TO THIS END, MY PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE LATERAL SEPTUM (LS) AS RICH IN N/OFQ (LSN/OFQ) AND THAT THIS DISCRETE POPULATION PLAYS A CAUSAL ROLE IN BINGE-LIKE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. MORE SPECIFICALLY, CELL-TYPE SPECIFIC CHEMOGENETIC ACTIVATION OF LSN/OFQ INCREASED ALCOHOL INTAKE WHILE SILENCING LSN/OFQ DECREASED DRINKING. IN ADDITION, I HAVE FOUND THIS EFFECT TO BE SPECIFIC TO ALCOHOL, SINCE LSN/OFQ MANIPULATION DID NOT AFFECT SUCROSE INTAKE NOR LOCOMOTION.

EMERGING EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL ABUSE ENHANCES PAIN SENSITIVITY AND ANXIETY IN ADULTHOOD, AND INCREASED PAIN SENSITIVITY AND HEIGHTENED ANXIETY MAY ENHANCE THE POTENTIAL FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE LATER IN LIFE. RECENTLY, A ROLE FOR A CIRCUIT INVOLVING THE BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA (BLA), MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (MPFC), AND VENTROLATERAL PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY (VLPAG) IN PAIN PROCESSING HAS BEEN DESCRIBED.

AFTER A WEEK-LONG MEDICATION TITRATION PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS ARE ASKED TO COME INTO THE LABORATORY TO RECEIVE THEIR SECOND MEDICATION BLISTER PACK AND TO BEGIN A 7-DAY PRACTICE QUIT ATTEMPT, DURING WHICH THEY WILL HAVE DAILY VIRTUAL (ONLINE AND PHONE) VISITS WHERE THEY WILL REPORT ON THEIR ALCOHOL. ADDITIONALLY, A SECOND CUE-REACTIVITY PARADIGM WILL BE CONDUCTED 90 MINUTES FOLLOWING STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE PRACTICE QUIT ATTEMPT (DAY 14). AFTER THE CUE-REACTIVITY PARADIGM, PARTICIPANTS WILL COMPLETE THE MCP, WHEREIN PARTICIPANTS CHOOSE BETWEEN A STANDARD ALCOHOL DRINK IMMEDIATELY OR A MONETARY REINFORCER IN ONE WEEK, A DELAY DISCOUNTING TASK, AND A HYPOTHETICAL PURCHASE TASK TO ASSESS ALCOHOL DEMAND. AIM 1 TESTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT NALTREXONE AND VARENICLINE WILL DECREASE ALCOHOL CHOICE COMPARED TO PLACEBO. AIM 2 TESTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ALCOHOL DRINKING DURING THE PRACTICE QUIT ATTEMPT WILL PREDICT ALCOHOL CHOICE AND THAT MEDICATION EFFECTS WILL MODERATE THIS RELATIONSHIP.

PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE) CAUSES SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN HUMANS AND IN ANIMAL MODELS, AND PERSISTENT PAE-INDUCED NEUROINFLAMMATION MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THESE IMPAIRMENTS, ALTHOUGH UNDERLYING MECHANISMS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. UNDERSTANDING THESE MECHANISMS WILL INFORM STRATEGIES THAT MAY IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. NEUROINFLAMMATION IS INDUCED THROUGH A COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC NETWORK OF LIPID MEDIATORS, CYTOKINES, AND CHEMOKINES PRODUCED FROM VARIOUS NEUROIMMUNE CELLS, INCLUDING MICROGLIA WHICH ARE THE RESIDENT MACROPHAGE-LIKE INNATE IMMUNE CELLS OF THE BRAIN. THEY ARE THE FIRST LINE OF INNATE IMMUNITY AND MEDIATE IMMUNE REGULATION AND RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION. POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS (PUFAS) PROVIDE CRITICAL STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS IN THE BRAIN AND IN RESIDENT IMMUNE CELLS. LONG-CHAIN PUFAS CAN ELICIT IMMUNOMODULATORY EFFECTS VIA THEIR METABOLITES; THESE LIPID MEDIATORS CAN ALTER THE INTENSITY AND/OR DURATION OF INFLAMMATION. OMEGA-3 PUFAS ARE WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND PRO-RESOLVING PROPERTIES; RELEVANT LIPID METABOLITES INCLUDE E-SERIES RESOLVINS DERIVED FROM EICOSAPENTAENOIC ACID (EPA) THAT ELICIT THEIR ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS BY BINDING TO THE CHEMERIN RECEPTOR (CHEMR23). MICROGLIA HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF EPA AND CHEMR23. ACTIVATION OF CHEMR23 SUPPRESSES NEUROINFLAMMATION, WHILE ITS REMOVAL INCREASES INFLAMMATION. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION DURING PREGNANCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED PUFA ACCUMULATION IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN WHICH MAY DISRUPT THE ABILITY OF MICROGLIA TO RESOLVE NEUROINFLAMMATION. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF RESOLVINS IN PAE-INDUCED NEUROINFLAMMATION. SPECIFICALLY, THIS STUDY WILL UTILIZE A CHEMR23 KNOCKOUT (KO) MOUSE STRAIN.

OF THE >88,000 ANNUAL DEATHS ATTRIBUTED TO ALCOHOL USE, APPROXIMATELY HALF ARE DUE TO BINGE DRINKING, MAKING IT THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES. BINGE DRINKING IS A STRONG PREDICTOR OF AUD DIAGNOSIS AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH DELETERIOUS HEALTH CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING DYSREGULATED SLEEP/WAKE PATTERNS AND DRASTIC CHANGES IN BIOLOGICAL AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS. CHANGES IN THESE PATTERNS, SUCH AS MUTATIONS IN CIRCADIAN GENES, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH INCREASED ETHANOL INTAKE AND THE MOTIVATION TO CONSUME ETHANOL. TO HELP TREAT INDIVIDUALS WITH AUDS, OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS OF BINGE DRINKING AND THE MOTIVATION TO DRINK ETHANOL. THE GOAL OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO TEST THE IMPORTANCE OF PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4 (PDE4) AS A MOLECULAR DETERMINANT IN 1) THE REGULATION OF CIRCADIAN GENES FOLLOWING CHRONIC ETHANOL INTAKE AND 2) THE MOTIVATIONAL ASPECTS OF BINGE-LIKE ETHANOL DRINKING. PDE4 INHIBITS THE ACTIVITY OF CYCLIC-AMP (CAMP), AN IMPORTANT SECOND MESSENGER FOR BOTH CIRCADIAN- AND MOTIVATION-RELATED CELL SIGNALING EVENTS. PHARMACOTHERAPIES WHICH INHIBIT PDE4, SUCH AS APREMILAST (WHICH IS FDA APPROVED TO TREAT PSORIASIS), HAVE PROVEN EFFICACIOUS IN REDUCING BINGE-LIKE ETHANOL INTAKE AND ETHANOL PREFERENCE, SUGGESTING A HIGH TRANSLATIONAL VALUE IN THE TREATMENT OF AUD. WE HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN THAT TWO PDE4 INHIBITORS (ROLIPRAM AND APREMILAST) REDUCE BINGE-LIKE DRINKING IN 3 HIGH DRINKING STRAINS OF MICE. MOREOVER, APREMILAST REDUCED BINGE DRINKING WHEN ADMINISTERED DIRECTLY IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS (NAC), A BRAIN REGION CENTRAL TO ETHANOL REINFORCEMENT. PDE4 INHIBITORS ARE ALSO KNOWN TO INCREASE THE AMPLITUDE OF CIRCADIAN GENE EXPRESSION, SUGGESTING THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL IN RESCUING THE MALADAPTIVE LOSS OF RHYTHMIC CIRCADIAN GENE EXPRESSION FOLLOWING CHRONIC ETHANOL DRINKING. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE TO TEST WHETHER THE PDE4 INHIBITOR, APREMILAST, CAN RESCUE THE REDUCTION IN CIRCADIAN GENE EXPRESSION IN THE NAC FOLLOWING CHRONIC BINGE-LIKE ETHANOL DRINKING. FURTHER, WE WILL TEST WHETHER APREMILAST TREATMENT REDUCES THE REINFORCING EFFECTS OF ETHANOL IN MICE USING OPERANT SELF-ADMINISTRATION. THIS APPROACH DIRECTLY TESTS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF HUMAN AUDS; THE MOTIVATION TO DRINK. IN CHANGES THE PROGRESSIVE INHIBITION COMPONENTS AIM 1, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER TREATMENT WITH APREMILAST AMELIORATES ETHANOL-INDUCED IN RHYTHMIC CIRCADIAN GENE EXPRESSION IN THE NAC. IN AIM 2, WE WILL T EST WHETHER APREMILAST EDUCES REINFORCING AND MOTIVATIONAL EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL HROUGH THE USE OF OPERANT SELF-ADMINISTRATION ON A ORDER OF REINFORCEMENT . THESE STUDIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DETERMINE MECHANISMS BY WHICH PDE4 DECREASES DRINKING BEHAVIORS AND RESCUES MALADAPTIVE CIRCADIAN GENE CHANGES, IMPORTANT OF ALCOHOL USE WITH FACE VALIDITY IN HUMAN AUDS.

ONE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS IMPAIRED CORTICOGENESIS THROUGH ALCOHOL\u2019S SUPPRESSION OF NEURAL PROGENITOR CELL (NPC) PROLIFERATION. RIBOSOME BIOGENESIS (RBG) IS A CRITICAL REGULATOR OF CELL CYCLE PROGRESSION AND ITS DISRUPTION CAUSES NUCLEOLAR STRESS AND CELL CYCLE ARREST. USING WHOLE-TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING AND KEGG PATHWAY ANALYSIS, I IDENTIFIED RIBOSOME BIOGENESIS (RBG) AS THE SINGLE GREATEST DOWNREGULATED PATHWAY WITHIN THE ALCOHOL-EXPOSED FETAL BRAIN CORTEX (60 OUT OF 70 RIBOSOMAL GENES; P-ADJ = 1.86E-49). TRANSCRIPTIONAL SUPPRESSION OF RBG OCCURS THROUGH DNA METHYLATION IN CPG REGULATORY REGIONS OF RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN (RP)- ENCODING GENES AND RIBOSOMAL DNA (RDNA). I FOUND THAT 36 RP-ENCODING GENES HAVING ATTENUATED EXPRESSION IN THE ALCOHOL-EXPOSED FETAL CORTEX WERE ALSO HYPERMETHYLATED IN THEIR 5\u2019 UPSTREAM REGULATORY REGIONS. CHOLINE IS AN ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT REQUIRED FOR NPC PROLIFERATION AND PROVIDES METHYL GROUPS FOR DNA METHYLATION. PRENATAL SUPPLEMENTAL CHOLINE RESTORED METHYLATION OF CYTOSINES IN THESE RP-ENCODING GENES. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT ALCOHOL IMPAIRS NPC PROLIFERATION, AT LEAST IN PART, THROUGH HYPERMETHYLATION OF CPG REGULATORY REGIONS IN RP-ENCODING GENES AND RDNA, AND THIS LEADS TO SUPPRESSED RBG, WHEREAS PRENATAL CHOLINE SUPPLEMENTATION PREVENTS THESE CHANGES. TO TEST THIS, I WILL ADMINISTER ALCOHOL, WITH AND WITHOUT CHOLINE SUPPLEMENTATION, TO PREGNANT NESTIN-CFPNUC TRANSGENIC MICE DURING THE PEAK PROLIFERATIVE PHASE OF FETAL CORTICAL NEUROGENESIS (E10.5 \u2013 E14.5); I WILL STUDY THEIR NPCS AT E14.5.

EARLY ONSET OF ALCOHOL USE (<15 YEARS OLD), INCREASES THE RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCOHOL USE DISORDER BY SEVEN TIMES COMPARED TO THOSE WHO START DRINKING LATER. THEREFORE, A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY ALCOHOL USE ONSET IN ADOLESCENCE IS CRUCIAL TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. TO THIS END, EXTENSIVE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AND HAVE IDENTIFIED GENETIC FACTORS LINKED TO FUTURE ALCOHOL USE, SUCH AS FAMILY HISTORY OF ALCOHOLISM AND HIGHER POLYGENIC LIABILITY. THE LIMITED SCOPE OF GENETIC STUDIES POSES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES INCLUDING THE (1) PRIMARY INCLUSION OF PARTICIPANTS OF EUROPEAN ANCESTRY, (2) EXCLUSION OF THOSE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF ALCOHOL USE, AND (3) UNCLEAR CLINICAL APPLICABILITY. THIS NECESSITATES THE NEED FOR EXPLORING NON-GENETIC ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES (I.E., EXPOSOME) ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL USE ONSET. AS SUCH, THE PROPOSED STUDY AIMS TO LEVERAGE DATA FROM THE HIGHLY POWERED AND NATIONALLY DIVERSE COHORT, THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT STUDY (ABCD; N = 11,000, 9-10-YEAR-OLDS), AND USE A NOVEL EXPOSOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (XWAS) APPROACH TO IDENTIFY EXPOSOMIC RISK FACTORS AND DERIVE POLYEXPOSURE ALCOHOL RISK SCORES (PXARS) FOR ALCOHOL USE ONSET IN ADOLESCENTS UP TO AGE 14. THE PERFORMANCE OF PXARS WILL BE BENCHMARKED AGAINST THESE ESTABLISHED GENETIC RISK FACTORS. FURTHERMORE, THE RISK FOR ALCOHOL USE ONSET IS LINKED TO POOR INHIBITORY CONTROL; THUS, THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL COMPREHENSIVELY EXAMINE THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL CORRELATES OF PROSPECTIVE ALCOHOL USE ONSET USING DATA FROM THE STOP SIGNAL TASK (SST). STUDIES ALSO SUGGEST THAT EXPOSOMIC FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE INHIBITORY CONTROL DEVELOPMENT; THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNCOVER ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN NEUROBEHAVIORAL FACTORS, PXARS, AND ALCOHOL USE ONSET. UNLIKE STUDYING THE GENOME, EXAMINING THE EXPOSOME ALLOWS FOR INVESTIGATING THE TOTALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT (I.E., NATURAL, BUILT, AND SOCIAL) TO UNCOVER POTENTIALLY CLINICALLY ACTIONABLE TARGETS. WHILE MANY EXPOSOMIC PREDICTORS MAY NOT BE EASILY MODIFIABLE (E.G., RACIAL BIASES, SOCIOECONOMIC BARRIERS) BUT STILL WARRANT CLOSE EXAMINATION; OTHER PREDICTORS (E.G., PEERS, DIET, AND ACTIVITIES) MAY BE VIABLE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION TARGETS FOR PREVENTING AND MINIMIZING ALCOHOL USE IN YOUTH. THE PROPOSED STUDY OFFERS THE APPLICANT A ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAM, WHICH INCLUDES IN-DEPTH INSTRUCTION ON BIG DATA AND BIOINFORMATICS APPROACHES, AS WELL AS TASK-BASED FMRI TECHNIQUES AND WILL SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN THE APPLICANT'S SKILLSET.

KIRSCHSTEIN NRSA F31 FELLOWSHIP IS TO DEVELOP THE EXPERTISE OF THE APPLICANT IN PATHOGENIC MECHANISMS OF ALCOHOL-INDUCED POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS (PTMS). ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED LIVER DISEASE (ALD) IS A LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE MORTALITY WORLDWIDE CAUSING APPROXIMATELY 5.9% OF DEATHS EVERY YEAR, YET LACKS PREVENTATIVE OR REGENERATIVE THERAPIES. THE LIVER IS THE PRIMARY SITE OF ALCOHOL DETOXIFICATION GENERATING PRODUCTS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT HEPATIC BIOCHEMISTRY. A MAJOR CONSEQUENCE OF ALCOHOL METABOLISM IS THE INDUCTION OF LYSINE ACETYLATION, A METABOLICALLY INDUCED PTM. ONE POORLY CHARACTERIZED FACTOR IS THE DISRUPTION TO THE NETWORK OF CYSTEINE THIOLS INVOLVED IN THE CYSTEINE PROTEOME, WHICH IS CRUCIAL TO ENZYME ACTIVITY, PROTEIN STRUCTURE, AND SIGNALING. MODELS OF EARLY-STAGE ALD HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO PROTEOMIC STUDIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL METABOLISM AND ELUCIDATE PERTURBED PATHWAYS. USING A 6-WEEK LIEBER-DECARLI (LD) MODEL, WE QUANTIFIED THIOL REDOX CHANGES IN THE HEPATIC PROTEOME EMPLOYING A NOVEL CLICK-CHEMISTRY-BASED NHPLC-MS/MS ASSAY. WITH THE SAME MODEL, WE EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF CHRONIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION ON HEPATIC LYSINE N-ACETYLATION THROUGH QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS VIA ACETYL-IP FOLLOWED BY NHPLC-MS/MS. BRIEFLY, THESE STUDIES IDENTIFIED THAT ALCOHOL FEEDING INDUCED AN OVERALL REDUCED CYSTEINE PROTEOME AND INCREASED LYSINE ACETYLATION. RECENT STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED A BIOPHYSICAL SPATIAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LYSINE AND CYSTEINE AMINO ACIDS LEADING TO DIRECT INTERACTIONS. LYSINE ACETYLATION IS AMPLIFIED WHEN CYSTEINE RESIDUES ARE WITHIN 15 \u00c5, REFERRED TO AS A CYSTEINE-LYSINE PAIR (CYSLYS). OUR WORK SUGGESTS THE ALCOHOL-INDUCED INCREASE IN N-ACETYLATION IS PARTIALLY DUE TO THE ACETYLATION OF THE MORE REACTIVE CYSTEINE THIOL FOLLOWED BY TRANSFER TO A NEARBY LYSINE, RESULTING IN AN SAN ACETYL TRANSFER REACTION. THE PROPOSED TRAINING PLAN WILL INVESTIGATE THIS RELATIONSHIP IN A CHRONIC LD MODEL BY INTEGRATING ACETYL- AND THIOL REDOX OMIC ANALYSES TO EVALUATE PATHOLOGICALLY RELEVANT PROTEIN TARGETS. THEREFORE, THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS F31 APPLICATION IS THAT PROTEIN CYSLYS PAIRS ARE A MECHANISM FOR INCREASED LYSINE ACETYLATION AND CYSTEINE REDOX SENSITIVITY DURING ALCOHOL TOXICITY AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE PATHOLOGY OF ALD. SPECIFIC AIM 1 WILL CHARACTERIZE HEPATIC PROTEOMIC SIGNATURES IMPACTED BY LYS ACETYLATION AND CYS REDOX CHANGES DUE TO CHRONIC ALCOHOL METABOLISM USING A MULTI-LAYERED INTEGRATED ANALYSIS.

ALCOHOL OUTLET DENSITY IS ONE SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC THAT HAS BEEN A FOCUS OF SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD. WHILE MANY AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS HAVE USED THIS RESEARCH TO PROMOTE POLICY ADVOCATING FOR MODIFICATIONS IN ALCOHOL OUTLET DENSITY, SUCH AS THROUGH CHANGES IN LICENSING AND ZONING, THE SCIENCE IS FAR FROM SETTLED. THE FINDINGS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUTLET DENSITY AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION ARE CONTRADICTORY WHEN EXAMINING INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL AND ECOLOGICAL LEVEL STUDIES AND THE EFFECT OF EVERY ADDITIONAL ALCOHOL OUTLET ON ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION ALSO REMAINS UNCLEAR. THE LACK OF CONSENSUS ON THE TRUE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALCOHOL OUTLET DENSITY AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION POINTS TO THE NEED FOR RIGOROUS INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL STUDIES THAT INCORPORATE CHARACTERISTICS THAT IMPACT AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S DECISION TO TRAVEL TO AN ALCOHOL OUTLET AND THE MULTISCALE NATURE OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION WITH RISK FACTORS LYING ON MULTIPLE LEVELS.

THIS PROPOSAL WILL TEST A NOVEL HYPOTHESIS THAT THE LONG NON-CODING RNA (LNCRNA) GROWTH ARREST SPECIFIC 5 (GAS5) IS A SEX-DEPENDENT AND [NEURON]-SPECIFIC MODULATOR OF ALCOHOL RESPONSIVE GR-DEPENDENT GENE EXPRESSION AND BEHAVIOR. GAS5 IS A KNOWN REPRESSOR OF GR ACTIVITY AND HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN LINKED TO AUD PHENOTYPES IN MICE AND HUMANS. OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CHANGES IN THE EXPRESSION OF GAS5, PARTICULARLY IN MPFC NEURONS, ARE RELATED TO CHRONIC ALCOHOL-INDUCED WITHDRAWAL AND ESCALATED ETHANOL CONSUMPTION IN MALE MICE. HOWEVER, THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM(S) FOR THESE GAS5-ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN MALE ANIMALS ARE UNKNOWN. ADDITIONALLY, NO CONCURRENT STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN FEMALE ANIMALS TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL SEX-DEPENDENT EFFECTS OF GAS5 FOR CHRONIC ALCOHOL-INDUCED BEHAVIORS. THIS PROJECT WILL DIRECTLY STUDY THE ROLE OF MPFC NEURONAL GAS5 IN THE ALCOHOL DEPENDENT TRANSCRIPTOME AND BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPES RELATED TO GR IN BOTH SEXES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE CHRONIC INTERMITTENT ETHANOL VAPOR EXPOSURE (CIEV) MODEL WILL BE USED IN TANDEM WITH STEREOTAXIC INJECTIONS OF AN ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS (AAV) TO INDUCE CRISPR/CAS9-MEDIATED KNOCKDOWN (KD) OF GAS5 IN MPFC NEURONS. THE THREE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE THE MOLECULAR AND BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES OF MPFC NEURON-SPECIFIC GAS5 KD AND CIEV. THE FIRST AIM OF THIS STUDY USES RNA IMMUNOPRECIPITATION FOLLOWED BY REAL TIME, QUANTITATIVE PCR (RIP-QPCR) TO DEFINE CHANGES IN MPFC GAS5-GR BINDING. THE SECOND AIM USES [NEXT-GENERATION RNA SEQUENCING (3\u2019TAG- SEQ) TO DETERMINE NEURON-SPECIFIC] ALTERATIONS IN THE GR-DEPENDENT TRANSCRIPTOME. THE THIRD AIM EMPLOYS A COMPREHENSIVE BATTERY TO ASSAY CHRONIC ETHANOL EXPOSURE-RELATED BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPES. THIS PROJECT IS A VITAL STEP IN THE FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF GAS5 IN AUD AND HOW GR-DEPENDENT PHENOTYPES EMERGE. THE PROPOSED STUDIES MAY AID IN RATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFECTIVE GR-MEDIATED PHARMACOTHERAPIES FOR AUD AND CO-MORBID DISORDERS (E.G., CHRONIC STRESS AND ANXIETY).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6ad8c5c3-8085-49bb-9227-fc5bc4a1f938-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F31AA031168_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160079538, "Award ID": "F31AA031164", "Award Amount": 47694.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-07", "CFDA Number": "93.273", "Description": "ASSESSING STATE EMOTIONS AND ACUTE ALCOHOL INTOXICATION ON SEXUAL ASSAULT RISK PERCEPTION - PROJECT SUMMARY ONE IN FIVE UNDERGRADUATE WOMEN EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT (SA) DURING THEIR COLLEGE CAREER, MOST COMMONLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ACUTE ALCOHOL INTOXICATION.

THESE RESPONSES CAN BE ATTENUATED THROUGH EXTINCTION LEARNING, WHERE CUES ARE REPEATEDLY PRESENTED WITHOUT THE PREVIOUSLY LEARNED FEARFUL OR REWARDING OUTCOME.

THESE STATES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN ALCOHOL SEEKING, TOLERANCE, AND LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION THAT FOLLOW REPEATED BOUTS OF ABSTINENCE. THIS HAS LED TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT BECOMES THE PRIMARY MOTIVATIONAL DRIVE \u2013 WHERE INDIVIDUALS CONSUME ALCOHOL TO ALLEVIATE THESE NEGATIVE STATES.

IN TWO SPECIFIC AIMS, I WILL: 1) CHARACTERIZE HEPATOCYTE MITOCHONDRIAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION RATE (OCR) IN RELATION TO MITOCHONDRIAL DEPOLARIZATION AND REPOLARIZATION AFTER ACUTE ETHANOL. I WILL ASSESS TIME-DEPENDENT CHANGES IN OCR AND MITOCHONDRIAL MEMBRANE POTENTIAL () OF HEPATOCYTES FRESHLY ISOLATED FROM ETHANOL-TREATED AND UNTREATED MICE USING SEAHORSE EXTRACELLULAR FLUX ANALYSIS, HANSATECH OXIMETRY, AND CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY OF FLUORESCENT  INDICATORS. BY INJECTING IN VIVO PRIOR TO HEPATOCYTE ISOLATION MITOTRACKER DYES, FLUOROPHORES THAT LABEL ONLY POLARIZED MITOCHONDRIA, I WILL IDENTIFY HEPATOCYTES HAVING UNDERGONE MTDEPO IN VIVO IN RELATION TO MTDEPO AND REPOLARIZATION IN VITRO. TO ADDRESS MY MECHANISTIC HYPOTHESES, I WILL ASSESS HOW SPECIFIC INHIBITORS OF ANT, ATP SYNTHASE, UCPS, AND PT PORES REVERSE/PREVENT ETHANOL-INDUCED MTDEPO AND INCREASED OCR. 2) ASSESS THE ROLE OF MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS AND MITOPHAGY IN RECOVERY FROM MTDEPO AFTER ACUTE ETHANOL. AS MICE METABOLICALLY ELIMINATE ETHANOL, HEPATOCYTES RECOVER FROM MTDEPO. IN MITOTIMER MICE, NEWLY SYNTHESIZED DSRED- E5 FLUORESCES GREEN BUT OVER TIME (12-24 H) SHIFTS IRREVERSIBLY TO RED FLUORESCENCE. IF REPOLARIZATION OF PREEXISTING MITOCHONDRIA OCCURS AFTER ETHANOL, THEN MITOTIMER FLUORESCENCE SHOULD BE PREDOMINANTLY RED IN MITOCHONDRIA RECOVERING FROM MTDEPO. IF REPOLARIZATION RESULTS FROM MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS, THEN RECOVERING MITOCHONDRIA WILL FLUORESCE GREEN. I EXPECT THAT REPOLARIZATION OF PREEXISTING MITOCHONDRIA AND BIOGENESIS OF NEW MITOCHONDRIA WILL BOTH CONTRIBUTE TO RECOVERY FROM MTDEPO AFTER ACUTE ETHANOL. TOGETHER, AIMS 1 AND 2 WILL CHARACTERIZE KEY MECHANISMS IN THE HEPATIC MITOCHONDRIAL RESPONSE TO ETHANOL, AS WELL AS IDENTIFY THE BASIS FOR RECOVERY.

WHEN CONSIDERED INDIVIDUALLY, ALCOHOL USE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAVE MARKED AND OPPOSING INFLUENCES ON NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL INDICATORS OF HEALTH AND SELF-REGULATION. ACUTE AND CHRONIC ALCOHOL NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM, RESULTING IN DECREASED HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AND BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY. HIGH-RISK DRINKING IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER INCENTIVE SALIENCE OF ALCOHOL CUES, RESULTING IN AN ENHANCED P3 EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL TO ALCOHOL RELATED STIMULI (ACR-P3). INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IMPROVES HRV, BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY, AND NEURAL PROCESSES CENTRAL TO P3 AMPLITUDE REDUCTION, ALTHOUGH ACR-P3 HAS NOT BEEN EXAMINED. PARADOXICALLY, GREATER ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION CONSISTENTLY HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH MORE FREQUENT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ACROSS THE ADULT LIFESPAN. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW THE EFFECTS OF THIS ANTAGONISTIC CLUSTERING OF CO-OCCURRING HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS ACCRUE ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR AND NEURAL PROCESSES THAT UNDERLIE THEIR REGULATION. FURTHER, A FEW RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THIS BETWEEN-PERSON ASSOCIATION OBSERVED BETWEEN ALCOHOL USE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAY NOT REFLECT WITHIN-PERSON DRINKING-ACTIVITY RELATIONS, AND MOST STUDIES HAVE RELIED ON SELF-REPORTS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO MEASURE COVARIATION IN ALCOHOL USE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, ASSESSED RETROSPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS OBJECTIVELY OVER A 7-10 DAY PERIOD TO TEST THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF DRINKING AND ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS ON HRV, BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY, AND ACR-P3.

STRONG RISK FACTORS FOR AUD INCLUDE EARLY LIFE CHALLENGES THAT CAUSE INFLAMMATION, SUCH AS EARLY LIFE STRESS AND EARLY EXPOSURE TO ALCOHOL. MICROGLIA, THE BRAIN\u2019S RESIDENT IMMUNE CELLS, BOTH RESPOND TO INFLAMMATORY CHALLENGES AND ORGANIZE DEVELOPING CIRCUITS, LENDING STRONG SUPPORT TO THE THEORY THAT IMMUNE SIGNALING CHANGES DURING DEVELOPMENT ALTER CIRCUIT MATURATION TO INCREASE LATER LIFE DRINKING. THEREFORE, IN MY PROPOSAL, I WILL DETERMINE IF THERE IS A DEVELOPMENTAL SENSITIVE WINDOW FOR INCREASED DRINKING VULNERABILITY CONTROLLED BY MICROGLIA. MY PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGESTS THAT MICROGLIA ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR INCREASED ADULT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION THROUGH A DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANISM: LOSS OF PRO-INFLAMMATORY SIGNALING SPECIFICALLY IN MICROGLIA THROUGH THE ABLATION OF MYD88, A CRITICAL TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR SIGNALING MOLECULE, INCREASES VOLUNTARY ADULT DRINKING IN BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC DRINKING PARADIGMS. PARVALBUMIN INTERNEURONS (PVIS), LATE-MATURING CRITICAL REGULATORS OF COORDINATED CELL ACTIVITY ACROSS THE BRAIN, ARE ALSO ALTERED IN FRONTAL CORTEX OF MYD88-DEFICIENT MICE, AN EFFECT THAT IS EXACERBATED BY EARLY-LIFE INFLAMMATION. THIS PVI CHANGE POINTS TO A POTENTIAL MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH MICROGLIA ARE IMPACTING CIRCUIT MATURATION AND BEHAVIOR. BASED ON THIS, MY CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MYD88- DEFICIENT MICROGLIA IMPROPERLY REGULATE THE SIZE OF THE DEVELOPING PVI POPULATION THROUGH REDUCED PHAGOCYTOSIS, LEADING TO INCREASED INHIBITORY FRONTAL CORTEX ACTIVITY IN ADULTHOOD THAT DRIVES EXCESSIVE DRINKING.

IN AIM 1, I WILL DETERMINE IF MYD88-DEFICIENT MICROGLIA EXHIBIT REDUCED PHAGOCYTOSIS OF PVI CELLS OR SYNAPSES DURING DEVELOPMENT THROUGH IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES. THEN I WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LOSS OF THIS FUNCTION IN THE FRONTAL CORTEX DURING A SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENTAL WINDOW IS SUFFICIENT TO INDUCE THE ALTERED DRINKING BEHAVIOR IN ADULTHOOD. I WILL DO THIS BY ADMINISTERING A TEMPORARY MICROGLIAL PHAGOCYTOSIS BLOCKING COMPOUND TO THE FRONTAL CORTEX DURING DEVELOPMENT AND THEN MEASURE ADULT DRINKING. IN AIM 2, I WILL DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGES TO FRONTAL CORTEX PVI ACTIVITY CAN DRIVE INCREASED ADULT DRINKING.

THIS WILL UNCOVER WHETHER INCREASING OR DECREASING PVI ACTIVITY IN THE FRONTAL CORTEX IS DRIVING THE EXCESSIVE DRINKING SEEN IN MYD88-DEFICIENT ANIMALS.

A WIDE RANGE OF COGNITIVE, BEHAVIORAL, AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN FASD, INCLUDING DEFICITS IN BEHAVIORS RELATED TO THE CEREBELLUM. THESE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR MAY ARISE FROM ETHANOL'S EFFECTS ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL. THE SOLE OUTPUT OF THE CEREBELLUM, PURKINJE CELLS, AS WELL AS MICROGLIA, THE IMMUNE CELLS OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, ARE BOTH IMPACTED BY DEVELOPMENTAL ETHANOL EXPOSURE. REDUCED NUMBERS OF BOTH NEURONS AND MICROGLIA, AS WELL AS ALTERATIONS IN PURKINJE CELL EXCITABILITY AND FIRING HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

THEREFORE, THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO UNCOVER THE METABOLIC MECHANISMS DRIVING HETEROGENEOUS, ZONATED HEPATOCYTE POPULATIONS TO TISSUE MASS RESTORATION AND TO ELUCIDATE THE METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING EVENTS IMPAIRING PROPER REGENERATION DURING ALD PROGRESSION. THROUGH THIS WORK, WE AIM TO TEST TWO HYPOTHESES: (1) DURING REGENERATION, AT PEAK CELLULAR PROLIFERATION, NORMALLY ZONATED METABOLIC GENE EXPRESSION IS DISRUPTED, LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN METABOLICALLY COMPENSATING HEPATOCYTES AND A DECREASE IN OVERALL PROLIFERATIVE ABILITY IN ETHANOL-ADAPTED LIVERS; (2) THERE EXISTS A SET OF PATHOLOGICAL, ZONE-SPECIFIC METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING EVENTS THAT CAN SIGNIFY THE EXTENT OF ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED, DECOMPENSATED LIVER DAMAGE AND HEPATOCYTE PROLIFERATIVE ABILITY AT EACH STAGE OF PROGRESSING ALD.  THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS SEEKS TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPATIAL REGULATION AND METABOLIC FUNCTIONALITY OF DISTINCT HEPATOCYTE POPULATIONS DURING REGENERATION. THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED USING A CHRONIC ETHANOL-FED RAT MODEL OF PARTIAL HEPATECTOMY, IN WHICH 70% OF THE LIVER IS RESECTED, TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN METABOLIC GENE TRANSCRIPTION AND FUNCTION OF HETEROGENEOUS HEPATOCYTE POPULATIONS, PROLIFERATING AND METABOLICALLY COMPENSATING, DURING REGENERATION. THE SECOND HYPOTHESIS SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING EVENTS OCCURRING DURING PROGRESSIVE ALD IN HUMAN PATIENTS. EXTENSIVE ANALYSES OF METABOLOMIC AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATA FROM HUMAN TISSUE SAMPLES WITH PROGRESSING ALD WILL BE PERFORMED TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS. BOTH HYPOTHESES WILL EMPLOY QUANTITATIVE METABOLIC MODELLING APPROACHES TO MAKE FUNCTIONAL PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE ENZYMATIC BEHAVIOR OF HEPATOCYTES DURING HEALTH AND DISEASE, WHICH WILL BE COMPARED TO AND TESTED AGAINST COLLECTED METABOLOMICS DATA.

DIGITAL STRESS EXPOSURE, DEFINED AS EXPOSURE TO ANY STRESSFUL EVENT THROUGH THE USE OF A SMARTPHONE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ONLINE NEWS ARTICLES, SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS, AND TEXT MESSAGES, HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED INCREASED ATTENTION. DIGITAL STRESS EXPOSURE HAS BEEN LINKED TO INCREASED ANXIETY AND PTSD SYMPTOMS, AND SOME REPORT DIGITAL STRESS EXPOSURE AS MORE STRESSFUL THAN IN- PERSON STRESS EXPOSURE. HOWEVER, RESEARCH HAS YET TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL STRESS EXPOSURE ON YOUNG ADULT AU. THE YEAR 2020 PRESENTS AS A UNIQUE WINDOW TO EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL STRESS EXPOSURE ON YOUNG ADULT ALCOHOL USE AS A MYRIAD OF UNCONTROLLABLE STRESSORS OCCURRED AT GLOBAL, NATIONAL, STATE AND INTERPERSONAL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, RACIAL INJUSTICES, AND CIVIL UNREST.

ONE OF THE MOST REPORTED CONSEQUENCES OF ACTIVE ALCOHOL USE AND RECOVERY FROM ALCOHOL USE DISORDER IS INSOMNIA, WHICH INCLUDES DIFFICULTIES FALLING ASLEEP (INCREASED SLEEP LATENCY), STAYING ASLEEP, OR ACHIEVING HIGH- QUALITY SLEEP. ALCOHOL-INDUCED INSOMNIA IS HIGHLY PREDICTIVE OF RELAPSE, MAKING IT AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF PERSISTENT ALCOHOL ABUSE. FOR IMPROVED TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDER AND PREVENTION OF RELAPSE, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS OF ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED SLEEP PROBLEMS, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. DROSOPHILA OFFER A VALUABLE APPROACH TO UNRAVELING THESE MECHANISMS THANKS TO THEIR TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE FOR SLEEP AND ALCOHOL RESPONSES AND THEIR HIGH ECONOMY OF SCALE. MY PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT A SINGLE, HIGH-DOSE ALCOHOL EXPOSURE ROBUSTLY INCREASES SLEEP LATENCY, THE TIME IT TAKES TO FALL ASLEEP, FOR AT LEAST SIX NIGHTS. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, IN AIM 1, I PROPOSE DETERMINING THE GENETIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ALCOHOL-INDUCED SLEEP DELAYS. I WILL DO SO BY EXAMINING HUMAN GENES, IDENTIFIED WITH GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES, THAT ARE LINKED TO ALCOHOL AND SLEEP PHENOTYPES. I WILL TEST THESE CANDIDATE GENES IN THE DROSOPHILA NERVOUS SYSTEM, EXAMINING THEIR NECESSITY FOR ALCOHOL-INDUCED SLEEP EFFECTS. IN AIM 2, I WILL DETERMINE THE ROLES OF NEURONS AND CONSERVED NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS IN ALCOHOL- INDUCED SLEEP DISRUPTIONS. I WILL UTILIZE A SUBSET OF A FEW HUNDRED UNCHARACTERIZED NEURONS THAT OUR LAB HAS FOUND TO AFFECT BOTH SLEEP LATENCY AND ALCOHOL RESPONSES.

IDENTIFYING POTENTIALLY MODIFIABLE ANTECEDENTS OF URGENCY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LARGE BODY OF LITERATURE HAS IMPLICATED URGENCY IN THE RISK PROCESS FOR ADOLESCENT PROBLEMATIC DRINKING (AS WELL AS OTHER IMPULSIGENIC BEHAVIORS SUCH AS BULIMIC BEHAVIOR, RISKY SEX, AND GAMBLING) (BERG ET AL., 2016; COSKUNPINAR ET AL., 2013; FISCHER ET AL., 2008; STAUTZ & COOPER, 2013). ADOLESCENT DRINKING IS ASSOCIATED WITH NUMEROUS PUBLIC HEALTH HARMS INCLUDING PHYSICAL SAFETY RISKS, INCREASED RISK FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER, INCREASES IN MALADAPTIVE PERSONALITY TRAITS, AND INCREASED RISK FOR PREMATURE DEATH (BIRKLEY ET AL., 2015; DE BELLIS ET AL., 2000; HINGSON & ZHA, 2006; KAMINER, 2016; MARSHALL, 2014; GULLER & SMITH, 2015). THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URGENCY AND PROBLEM DRINKING RECIPROCAL SUCH THAT INCREASES IN EACH FACTOR PRECIPITATE INCREASES IN THE OTHER (RILEY ET AL, 2016). THOUGH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URGENCY AND PROBLEM DRINKING HAS BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ETIOLOGY OF URGENCY ITSELF. CYDERS AND SMITH (2008) PROPOSED A DEVELOPMENTAL MODEL OF URGENCY IN WHICH CHILDHOOD TEMPERAMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INCREASE RISK FOR URGENCY, BUT ONLY TEMPERAMENT HAS BEEN EXAMINED IN THE LITERATURE (WADDELL ET AL., 2021). HERSH AND HUSSONG (2009) IDENTIFIED A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEGATIVE PARENTAL EMOTION SOCIALIZATION AND INCREASED SUBSTANCE USE IN ADOLESCENCE AND, IN OUR OWN WORK, WE FOUND CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT URGENCY MEDIATES THE PREDICTIVE INFLUENCE OF MALADAPTIVE EMOTION SOCIALIZATION ON ADOLESCENT DRINKING (ATKINSON ET AL., UNDER REVIEW).

THESE BRAIN CHANGES AND PERSISTENT ACTIVATION OF DRUG MEMORIES ARE BELIEVED TO BE CENTRAL IN CONTRIBUTING TO DRUG ADDICTION. A PREPONDERANCE OF LITERATURE HAS STUDIED THE TRIPARTITE SYNAPSE (PRE- AND POSTSYNAPTIC CELLS, AND ASTROCYTES) IN ADDICTION; HOWEVER, MOUNTING EVIDENCE HAS IMPLICATED THE TETRAPARTITE SYNAPSE TO INDICATE THE ADDITIONAL INVOLVEMENT OF EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX (ECM) MOLECULES IN THIS PROCESS. THE ECM IS COMPRISED OF A COMPLEX NETWORK OF GLYCOPROTEINS, CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCANS (CSPG), AND ENZYMES, WHICH INTERACT TO CONTROL UNDERLYING CELL PLASTICITY AND EXCITABILITY. GLYCOPROTEINS AND CSPGS AGGREGATE AROUND INHIBITORY FAST-SPIKING PARVALBUMIN (PVB) INTERNEURONS THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN TO FORM PERINEURONAL NETS (PNN) WHICH MAINTAIN AND STRENGTHEN SYNAPSES. IN RODENTS, PNNS ARE TEMPORARILY DEGRADED AFTER ACUTE EXPOSURE TO DRUGS, A PROCESS THAT RELIES ON THE ACTIVITY OF GLIAL CELLS WHICH SECRETE ENDOGENOUS PROTEASES THAT CLEAVE PNN COMPONENTS. AFTER PERSISTENT ACTIVATION OF REWARD MEMORIES (I.E., DEPENDENCE), PNNS NUMBERS ARE INCREASED, INDICATING THAT NEURONAL ENSEMBLES ASSOCIATED WITH DRUGS OF ABUSE ARE ENVELOPED BY PNNS.

WHILE MANY OF THE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISORDER HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED, THE UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, SUCH AS NEUROINFLAMMATION AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC ALTERATIONS, REQUIRE FURTHER STUDY. THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTS A NOVEL HYPOTHESIS FOR TESTING THE POTENTIAL MECHANISM(S) COORDINATING THESE MOLECULAR AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES. INTEGRATING PREVIOUS LITERATURE, I HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE LONG NON-CODING RNA (LNCRNA) MALAT1 MAY MEDIATE NEUROINFLAMMATORY RESPONSES TO ETHANOL AND ETHANOL CONSUMPTION.  NON-CODING RNAS ARE CONTINUALLY BEING RECOGNIZED AS INTEGRAL PLAYERS IN SEVERAL BASIC CELLULAR FUNCTIONS. MALAT1 HAS BEEN SHOWN TO COORDINATE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION AND INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES, WITH MULTIPLE STUDIES SUGGESTING A LINK BETWEEN MALAT1 AND THE HIGH MOBILITY GROUP BOX 1 (HMGB1)/TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 4 (TLR4) NEUROINFLAMMATORY CASCADE. IN THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL, I WANT TO DETERMINE IF MALAT1 REGULATES EXPRESSION OF THE HMGB1/TLR4 PATHWAY IN RESPONSE TO ETHANOL, PARTICULARLY IN ASTROCYTES, A CNS CELL-TYPE THAT REGULATES NEUROIMMUNE RESPONSES AND PLAYS A PIVOTAL ROLE IN CONTROLLING BEHAVIOR.

GLUTAMATERGIC PYRAMIDAL NEURONS DRIVE THESE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES SUCH THAT HIGHER PYRAMIDAL NEURON EXCITABILITY FACILITATES ANXIETY AND REWARD-SEEKING. PYRAMIDAL NEURONS RECEIVE GLUTAMATERGIC INPUTS FROM MIDLINE STRUCTURES LIKE THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX THROUGH THE STRIA TERMINALIS (ST) AND MORE LATERAL CORTICAL AREAS SEND GLUTAMATERGIC INPUTS THROUGH THE EXTERNAL CAPSULE (EC).

SMW ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY THAN HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN TO REPORT INDICATORS OF HD; FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE 3-7 TIMES HIGHER ODDS OF PAST-YEAR ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE SYMPTOMS.

ONE POTENTIAL MODERATING FACTOR THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN INVESTIGATED IS SEXUAL COMPULSIVITY (SC), WHICH IS THE INABILITY TO CONTROL FREQUENT AND INTENSE SEXUAL URGES OR IMPULSES. SC IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIV RISK, ALCOHOL USE, AND INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF ALCOHOL USE BEFORE SEX, SUGGESTING THOSE HIGH IN SC MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALCOHOL\u2019S EFFECTS ON SEXUAL RISK. THE INHIBITION CONFLICT MODEL (ICM) OF ALCOHOL MYOPIA SUGGESTS THAT ALCOHOL HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT ON SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIOR IN SITUATIONS WHERE A PERSON IS CONFLICTED DUE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPERIENCING HIGH SEXUAL INSTIGATION AND HIGH SEXUAL INHIBITION.

UNFORTUNATELY, MOST IMAGING STUDIES COMPARE INDIVIDUALS WITH AUD TO HEALTHY CONTROLS \u2013 OR IF THEY DO ASSESS SEVERITY, ONLY DO SO IN ONE COGNITIVE DOMAIN AND IN ONE SAMPLE. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE TWO AVENUES TO INVESTIGATE AUD SEVERITY IN FMRI DATA. BOTH LINES OF RESEARCH ARE INFLUENCED BY THE OBSERVATION THAT THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK (DMN) IS ALTERED IN AUD AND IN ADDICTION GENERALLY. ALTHOUGH THE DMN IS TYPICALLY MORE PROMINENT IN RESTING-STATE FMRI, ANALYSIS OF TASK-BASED FMRI HAS SUGGESTED A PLAUSIBLE FUNCTIONAL ROLE FOR DMN ACTIVITY IN ADDICTION. HIGH DMN ACTIVITY SEEMS TO ATTRIBUTE HIGH VALUE TO COMMODITIES LIKE ALCOHOL, DRIVEN BY PREOCCUPATION DURING THE UNSATIATED AND CRAVING STATES.

FURTHERMORE, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE EFFECTS ARE A RESULT OF ETHANOL EXPOSURE DURING THE PERIOD OF PROTEIN SYNTHESIS-DEPENDENT MEMORY CONSOLIDATION SPECIFICALLY OR, RATHER, A GENERAL OUTCOME OF POST-TRAINING ETHANOL EXPOSURE.

A TRANSDIAGNOSTIC RISK FACTOR THAT MAY UNDERLIE COMORBID HAZARDOUS DRINKING AND PTSD IS ANXIETY SENSITIVITY (I.E., THE FEAR OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF ANXIETY-RELATED SENSATIONS). ANXIETY SENSITIVITY IS A MALLEABLE, COGNITIVE-AFFECTIVE VULNERABILITY FACTOR THAT IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO HAZARDOUS DRINKING AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF PTSD. AN INTEGRATED INTERVENTION TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET ANXIETY SENSITIVITY IN THE CONTEXT OF HAZARDOUS DRINKING AND PTSD SYMPTOMS HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR TESTED.

THIS RESULTS IN A DECREASE IN ITS REGULATORY TARGETS, INCLUDING VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL ZINC FINGER 1 (VEZF1), A NOVEL TARGET WE HAVE IDENTIFIED, WHICH IS A CRITICAL REGULATOR OF VASCULAR DEVELOPMENT.

REM SLEEP IS GENERATED AND MAINTAINED BY THE INTERPLAY OF SEVERAL NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS IN THE BRAINSTEM, FOREBRAIN, AND HYPOTHALAMUS. ONE KEY NEUROTRANSMITTER IS - AMINOBUTYRIC ACID (GABA), WHICH ALSO IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MEDIATOR OF ALCOHOL'S BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS.

ESTABLISHING MODERATORS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND MECHANISMS OF ACTION IS AN IMPERATIVE STEP TOWARDS IDENTIFYING PREDICTORS OF GOOD CLINICAL RESPONSE AND FURTHERING PRECISION MEDICINE. MODULATION OF IMMUNE FUNCTION IS ONE PROMISING TREATMENT TARGET FOR ADDICTION. THROUGH ACTIVATION OF IMMUNE CELL RECEPTORS, SUSTAINED HEAVY ALCOHOL USE INDUCES A PROINFLAMMATORY STATE, WHICH CONTRIBUTES OF AUD SYMPTOMATOLOGY. NEGATIVE AFFECT IS MULTI-FACETED CONSTRUCT AND COMMON FEATURE OF AUD THAT IS CONSISTENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH POORER TREATMENT OUTCOMES AND MAY BE LINKED TO INFLAMMATION INDUCED BY CHRONIC ALCOHOL USE. ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THERAPIES ARE SHOWN TO REDUCE LEVELS OF NEGATIVE AFFECT AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. AS SUCH, REDUCTIONS IN FACETS OF NEGATIVE AFFECT MAY BE A POTENTIAL MECHANISM OF ACTION INVOLVED IN NEUROIMMUNE MODULATION IN AUD. IN REGARD TO CANDIDATE MODERATORS, RESEARCH ACROSS DISCIPLINES SHOWS THAT A PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED INFLAMMATORY PROFILE MIGHT BE MORE AMENABLE TO NEUROIMMUNE TREATMENT.

IN ADDITION, THERE IS CLINICAL EVIDENCE THAT CHRONIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION MAY UPREGULATE AROM ACTIVITY AND E2 SYNTHESIS, SUGGESTING THAT ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF AROM MAY CONTRIBUTE TO ALCOHOL-RELATED BEHAVIOR. I FIND THAT ACUTE PHARMACOLOGICAL AROM INHIBITION REDUCES ALCOHOL DRINKING IN MALES FOLLOWING 3 WEEKLY CYCLES OF BINGE DRINKING AND IN FEMALES FOLLOWING 10 CYCLES.

WE ALSO PLAN TO MANIPULATE H3K36ME3 LEVELS WITHIN THE PFC TO DETERMINE IF ALTERING THIS EPIGENETIC MARK CAN CHANGE THE BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES OF ADOLESCENT BINGE ETHANOL. THESE STUDIES THEREFORE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO EXPAND THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS CAN INDUCE LASTING BEHAVIORAL CHANGES. THE SUCCESS OF THESE EPIGENETIC AND GENOMIC STUDIES WILL IDENTIFY NOVEL GENES THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERSISTENT MEMORY DEFICITS ASSOCIATED WITH ADOLESCENT BINGE ETHANOL, WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO PHARMACEUTICAL TARGETS TO REVERSE COGNITIVE DEFICITS ASSOCIATED WITH ADOLESCENT BINGE DRINKING.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PLAN WILL TEST NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ALTERED SENSITIVITY TO ALCOHOL IN BIPOLAR DISORDER AND TYPICALLY DEVELOPING YOUNG ADULTS. DIFFERENCES IN SUBJECTIVE RESPONSE TO ALCOHOL PREDICT ALCOHOL USE PROBLEMS AND RISK FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS IN TYPICALLY DEVELOPING YOUTH, HOWEVER THE MECHANISMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS RISK\u2014OR IF SIMILAR MECHANISMS ARE OBSERVED\u2014IN PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS ARE UNCLEAR. WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY WITHIN VENTRAL PREFRONTAL CORTICAL NETWORKS IS RELATED TO ALCOHOL-INDUCED CHANGES IN NETWORK FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY, AND THEREFORE, SUBJECTIVE SENSITIVITY TO ALCOHOL. RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO RISK FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS IN BIPOLAR DISORDER AND TYPICALLY DEVELOPING YOUNG ADULTS. THE APPLICANT AND MENTORS, DRS. ELIZABETH LIPPARD AND KIM FROMME HAVE DESIGNED A COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH AND TRAINING PLAN TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS. THE TRAINING PLAN EMPHASIZES 1) CONCEPTUAL TRAINING IN THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AND CLINICAL ISSUES IN BIPOLAR AND ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS; 2) METHODOLOGICAL TRAINING IN ADVANCED NEUROIMAGING (FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING [DTI] METHODOLOGY) AND PLACEBO-CONTROLLED ALCOHOL ADMINISTRATION; AND 3) CAREER DEVELOPMENT SKILLS, INCLUDING MENTORSHIP, STATISTICS, TEACHING, WRITING, AND RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH.

SAD IS AN IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUD, AND COMORBID SAD AND AUD CONFER GREATER DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES THAN EITHER DISORDER ALONE. BUILDING ON CRITICAL FOUNDATIONAL WORK USING NEGATIVE EMOTION REGULATION MODELS TO EXPLAIN COMORBID AUD AND SAD, THE CURRENT PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON POSITIVE EMOTION REGULATION, PARTICULARLY DIFFICULTY ACCEPTING POSITIVE EMOTIONS, WHICH MAY ALSO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN DRIVING COMORBIDITY. PAST RESEARCH HAS ESTABLISHED THAT PEOPLE HIGH IN SAD SYMPTOMS HAVE DIFFICULTIES REGULATING POSITIVE EMOTIONS, INCLUDING DIFFICULTY ACCEPTING POSITIVE EMOTIONS. ALTHOUGH PEOPLE WITH AUD OFTEN EXPERIENCE DEFICITS IN POSITIVE EMOTION REGULATION IN THEIR DAILY LIVES (I.E., WHEN SOBER), THERE IS EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT, IN THE SHORT TERM, ALCOHOL USE FACILITATES ADAPTIVE POSITIVE EMOTION REGULATION. FOR EXAMPLE, A RECENT ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA) STUDY FOUND THAT ALCOHOL WEAKENED THE RELATION BETWEEN STATE SAD SYMPTOMS AND REPORTED SOCIAL INTERACTION QUALITY. SPECIFICALLY, WHEN PARTICIPANTS DID NOT CONSUME ALCOHOL, STATE SAD SYMPTOMS PREDICTED WORSE SOCIAL INTERACTION QUALITY, BUT WHEN THEY DID CONSUME ALCOHOL, STATE SAD SYMPTOMS DID NOT AFFECT SOCIAL INTERACTION QUALITY. THUS, AN UNDERSTUDIED AREA OF RESEARCH IS WHETHER ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION TEMPORARILY ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS WITH ELEVATED SAD SYMPTOMS TO ACCEPT POSITIVE EMOTIONS, WHICH, IN THE LONG TERM, COULD LEAD TO ALCOHOL-RELATED PROBLEMS. AIM 1: USING EMA METHODOLOGY, TEST WHETHER, ON A WITHIN-PERSON LEVEL, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION MODERATES THE DAY-TO-DAY TEMPORAL RELATION BETWEEN STATE SAD SYMPTOMS AND DIFFICULTY ACCEPTING POSITIVE EMOTIONS IN YOUNG ADULTS AT RISK FOR BOTH AUD AND SAD. IT IS EXPECTED THAT GREATER STATE SOCIAL ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WILL PREDICT GREATER DIFFICULTY ACCEPTING POSITIVE EMOTIONS, BUT ALCOHOL WILL MODERATE (WEAKEN) THIS RELATION. AIM 2: TEST WHETHER, ON A BETWEEN-PERSON LEVEL, THE EXTENT TO WHICH ALCOHOL HELPS PEOPLE ACCEPT POSITIVE EMOTIONS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL-RELATED PROBLEMS ACROSS PARTICIPANTS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ALCOHOL IN REDUCING THE DELETERIOUS IMPACT OF SAD ON DIFFICULTY ACCEPTING POSITIVE EMOTIONS WILL BE CORRELATED WITH GREATER ALCOHOL-RELATED PROBLEMS. BY CLARIFYING WHETHER ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION\u2019S BENEFIT TO POSITIVE EMOTION REGULATION (E.G., INCREASING ACCEPTANCE OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS) CONTRIBUTES TO PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE, RESULTS OF THIS STUDY MAY PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE OF IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH-RELATED TARGETS FOR PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION IN THOSE AT RISK FOR AUD.

POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS FOLLOWING SEXUAL VICTIMIZATION MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THESE INCREASED RATES OF ALCOHOL USE. THE PREDOMINANT THEORETICAL EXPLANATION FOR THESE ASSOCIATIONS IS THE SELF-MEDICATION HYPOTHESIS, WHICH POSITS THAT SEXUAL VIOLENCE SURVIVORS USE ALCOHOL IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE EXPERIENCES OF PTSD. DESPITE THE TEMPORAL, WITHIN-PERSON NATURE OF THIS THEORY, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO DAILY ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ACUTE PTSD SYMPTOMS, TRAUMA-RELATED DRINKING TO COPE, AND ENSUING ALCOHOL USE BY SV SURVIVORS. MOREOVER, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED SLEEP DURATION AS A FACTOR THAT MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS PROCESS, DESPITE EMERGING THEORY SUGGESTING THAT SLEEP LOSS HAS CRUCIAL EFFECTS ON AFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING AND MAY EXACERBATE DAILY PTSD SYMPTOMS. DRAWING ON THESE FINDINGS, THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESES IN THE PRESENT STUDY ARE THAT SHORTER THAN USUAL SLEEP DURATION IS LIKELY TO HAVE A PROXIMAL EFFECT ON INCREASED PTSD SYMPTOMS THE NEXT DAY, AND THAT GREATER THAN USUAL PTSD SYMPTOMS WILL IN TURN PREDICT INCREASED ALCOHOL USE LATER THAT DAY THROUGH INCREASED TRAUMA-RELATED DRINKING TO COPE MOTIVES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT THAT ACUTE PTSD SYMPTOMS AND TRAUMA-RELATED DRINKING TO COPE MAY BE A SERIAL INDIRECT PATHWAY THROUGH WHICH SHORTER THAN USUAL SLEEP DURATION LEADS TO INCREASED NEXT-DAY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AMONG FEMALE SV SURVIVORS. TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES, A SAMPLE OF 80 COMMUNITY WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE WHO ARE PROBLEMATIC DRINKERS WILL COMPLETE REPEATED DAILY MEASURES OF SLEEP DURATION, PTSD SYMPTOMS, TRAUMA- RELATED DRINKING TO COPE, AND ALCOHOL USE OVER THREE WEEKS USING ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA).

CONSIDERING THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT OCCURS DURING THIS PERIOD, A CENTRAL CONCERN TO RESEARCHERS, POLICY MAKERS, AND PARENTS IS THE IMPACT OF ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL USE (AU) ON COGNITIVE CAPACITIES CRITICAL TO LIFE SUCCESS, LIKE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING (EF). EF REFERS TO A FAMILY OF TOP-DOWN MENTAL PROCESSES THAT SUPPORT CONCENTRATION, ATTENTION, AND BEHAVIORAL REGULATION44. HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF EF IS ESSENTIAL FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, AND SUCCESS IN LIFE31,32. IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT ADOLESCENT AU PRODUCES PHYSIOLOGICAL AND NEUROBIOLOGICAL EVENTS THAT DERAIL HEALTHY EF DEVELOPMENT18,30. HOWEVER, SUPPORT FOR THIS ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN MIXED8,35.

CO-OCCURRING DRUG USE MAY ALSO HAVE DIRECT NEUROTOXIC EFFECTS THAT DERAIL EF7,13,18. HENCE, POOR EF THAT HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE NEUROTOXIC EFFECTS OF ADOLESCENT AU MAY ACTUALLY BE DUE TO THESE OTHER CO-OCCURRING BEHAVIORS.

WE PROPOSE TO (1) DISTINGUISH GENERAL EXTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS FROM DOMAIN SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS (INCLUDING AU, AGGRESSION, RULE-BREAKING, DRUG USE) USING SOPHISTICATED LONGITUDINAL BIFACTOR MODELING, (2) EXAMINE PROSPECTIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN GENERAL EXTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS AND DOMAIN SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS, AND EF (MEASURED BY FMRI AND A BEHAVIORAL TASK) ACROSS ADOLESCENCE AND EARLY ADULTHOOD, AND (3) EXAMINE WHETHER POOR ADAPTATION ACROSS SEVERAL SOCIAL CONTEXTS (PARENTS, PEERS, AND SCHOOL) MEDIATES ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN EXTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS AND DEFICITS IN EF. A HIGH-RISK LONGITUDINAL SAMPLE (N=3,337) OF CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS FROM THE MICHIGAN LONGITUDINAL STUDY WILL BE USED TO TEST THE PROPOSED AIMS46.

THE BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA (BLA) IS A BRAIN REGION INVOLVED IN THE PROGRESSION OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE THAT FACILITATES REWARD-SEEKING AND EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORS LIKE ANXIETY. OUR LABORATORY HAS SHOWN THAT INPUT-SPECIFIC ALTERATIONS IN GLUTAMATE/GABA NEUROTRANSMISSION OCCUR FOLLOWING CHRONIC ETHANOL/WITHDRAWAL. FOR EXAMPLE, STRIA TERMINALIS (ST) GLUTAMATERGIC AFFERENTS EXHIBIT PRESYNAPTIC FACILITATION DURING WITHDRAWAL. LATERAL PARACUPSULAR CELLS (LPCS) AND LOCAL INTERNEURONS OF THE BLA GABAERGIC SYSTEM EXPRESS DIFFERENT OUTCOMES TO CHRONIC ETHANOL: LPCS SHOW AN ATTENUATION OF GABA RELEASE, WHILE LOCAL INTERNEURONS SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. TOGETHER, THESE ALTERATIONS IN GABAERGIC/GLUTAMATERGIC AFFERENTS YIELD A HYPEREXCITABLE STATE IN BLA PYRAMIDAL NEURONS DURING ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW ETHANOL ALTERS THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF UPSTREAM MODULATORY SYSTEMS, OR WHETHER THESE PROJECTIONS INFLUENCE THE GENERATION OF ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIORS.

AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC PAIN THE RATE OF HAZARDOUS ALCOHOL USE IS ELEVATED COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION5, YET, HAZARDOUS ALCOHOL USERS WITH CHRONIC PAIN REMAIN AN UNDERSERVED GROUP. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO TEST ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLIMENTARY APPROACHES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE HAZARDOUS ALCOHOL USE AMONG THIS HIGH-RISK SEGMENT OF THE GENERAL POPULATION; DOING SO IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION (I.E., JOINTLY TARGETING ALCOHOL AND AFFECTIVE MECHANISMS THAT MAY MAINTAIN PAIN-ALCOHOL ASSOCIATIONS) MAY PROVIDE A MORE EFFICIENT AND TARGETED INTERVENTION APPROACH. TARGETING PAIN-RELATED ANXIETY, A TRANSDIAGNOSTIC VULNERABILITY FACTOR THAT IS PROSPECTIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH HAZARDOUS DRINKING AND CHRONIC PAIN6,7, MAY BE BENEFICIAL. THUS, MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO EVALUATE THE BENEFIT OF TARGETING ELEVATED PAIN-RELATED ANXIETY AMONG HAZARDOUS DRINKERS WITH CHRONIC PAIN.

THUS, DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PHARMACOTHERAPIES IS NECESSARY. OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE IN DESIGNING SUCH THERAPIES ARE THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS OF ALCOHOL-RELATED BEHAVIORS WITH THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, DEMONSTRATING THE NEED FOR INCORPORATING SOCIAL PARADIGMS IN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION STUDIES. OUR LABORATORY UTILIZES THE UNIQUE HERDSMAN CAGE SYSTEM TO ALLOW FOR PRECISE, INDIVIDUALIZED MEASUREMENTS OF BOTH CONSUMPTION AND BEHAVIOR IN A TRULY SOCIAL SETTING. OXYTOCIN (OXT), A HORMONE WITH CRUCIAL ROLES IN A VARIETY OF SOCIAL BEHAVIORS HAS DRAWN ATTENTION AS A PROMISING PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR AUD WITH ITS IMPLICATED ROLE IN MEDIATING THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG USE, AS WELL AS ITS SOCIAL EFFECTS, WHICH MAY SERVE TO BOLSTER ABSTINENCE. OXT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN DECREASING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN RODENTS AND ALCOHOL CRAVING IN HUMANS. OUR LABORATORY RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED ROBUST EFFECTS OF REPEATED OXT TREATMENT IN DECREASING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN THE PRAIRIE VOLE (MICROTUS OCHROGASTER) - A SOCIALLY MONOGAMOUS RODENT SPECIES WITH DEMONSTRATED TRANSLATIONAL VALIDITY TO HUMANS THROUGH COMMON MECHANISMS REGULATING SOCIAL BEHAVIORS. GIVEN THE PHARMACOTHERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF OXT, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO CHARACTERIZE THE BEHAVIORAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF OXT'S DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO DECREASE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION.

ALTHOUGH MOST ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES WILL DRINK ALCOHOL IN THEIR LIFE, ONLY ABOUT 6% WILL GO ON TO DEVELOP AN ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD). WE UNDERSTAND THE CYCLE OF ADDICTION, BUT IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHY CERTAIN PEOPLE TRANSITION TO DISORDERED DRINKING. DISTURBED NETWORK ACTIVITY IN REGIONS IMPLICATED IN AUDS, LIKE THE BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA (BLA), HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS A POTENTIAL EXPLANATION. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA DEMONSTRATES THAT ALCOHOL CAN MODULATE BLA NETWORK ACTIVITY AND THE INTRINSIC DIFFERENCES IN BLA ACTIVITY IN RESPONSE TO ACUTE ALCOHOL EXPOSURE CAN PREDICT FUTURE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN AN INTERMITTENT ACCESS (IA) PARADIGM. THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE CELLULAR MECHANISM UNDERLYING THIS RELATIONSHIP.  OUR LAB HAS SHOWN THAT GABAERGIC PARVALBUMIN (PV) INTERNEURONS ARE CRUCIAL MODULATORS OF NETWORK ACTIVITY IN THE BLA. THEREFORE, MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL PV INTERNEURONS ARE POSITIONED TO INFLUENCE COMMUNICATION IN THE REGION. FURTHER, OUR LAB HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT D SUBUNIT CONTAINING GABAA RECEPTORS, WHICH ARE UNIQUELY SENSITIVE TO THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL, ARE HIGHLY EXPRESSED ON PV INTERNEURONS IN THE BLA. THESE RECEPTORS ALSO INFLUENCE ALCOHOL INTAKE IN A VOLUNTARY BINGE DRINKING PARADIGM AND ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN WITHDRAWAL. THEREFORE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ALCOHOL MODULATES NETWORK ACTIVITY IN THE BLA THROUGH D-GABAA RECEPTORS ON PV INTERNEURONS IN THE BLA WHICH INFLUENCES LEVELS OF FUTURE VOLUNTARY ALCOHOL INTAKE.  WE WILL BUILD ON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWING THAT BLA RESPONSES TO ACUTE ALCOHOL CAN PREDICT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN AN IA PARADIGM BY INVESTIGATING THE MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTING TO EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL INTAKE. THE CURRENT PROJECT WILL DETERMINE IF THE GABAAR D SUBUNIT MEDIATES ALCOHOL\u2019S EFFECTS ON BLA OSCILLATIONS BY A CRISPR MEDIATED DELETION OF THE GABAAR D SUBUNIT GENE (GABRD) SPECIFICALLY ON PV INTERNEURONS IN THE BLA AND RECORDING LOCAL FIELD POTENTIALS (LFPS) IN THE BLA DURING ACUTE EXPOSURE TO ALCOHOL AND AN IA PARADIGM.  THE EXPERIMENTS IN THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL PROVIDE NOVEL INSIGHT INTO HOW ALCOHOL CHANGES THE NETWORK ACTIVITY OF THE BLA.

DESPITE THIS, ONLY AROUND SEVEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH AUD SEEK TREATMENT AND OPTIONS FOR CARE REMAIN LIMITED, CREATING AN URGENT NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH INTO THE DEVELOPMENT AND TREATMENT OF AUD. A MAJOR SOURCE OF INTEREST LIES IN WHAT FACTORS PREDISPOSE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO CONSUME ALCOHOL OVER OTHERS TO DEVELOP AUD, WHICH CAN PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO SPECIFIC PREVENTATIVE AND TREATMENT MEASURES FOR THIS POPULATION. DEFICITS IN COGNITIVE DOMAINS OF RESPONSE INHIBITION AND COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AS RISK FACTORS FOR LATER DEVELOPMENT OF AUD AND ARE PREDICTORS OF MORE SEVERE ALCOHOL INDUCED COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION. THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (MPFC) IS AT THE CENTER OF THE BRAIN CIRCUITRY THAT MEDIATES ASPECTS OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION KNOWN TO BE IMPAIRED IN AUD AND STUDYING THE UNDERLYING NEURAL PATHWAYS IMPACTED BY ALCOHOL EXPOSURE HAS BEEN A MAJOR AREA OF STUDY IN THE FIELD.

CAREER DEVELOPMENT TRAINING WILL FOCUS ON HIGH PRIORITY HIV/AIDS COMORBIDITY-RELATED RESEARCH, UTILIZING A PRECLINICAL RODENT MODEL OF HIV GP120-INDUCED NEUROPATHIC PAIN ALONGSIDE INVESTIGATION OF A CLINICAL POPULATION OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH). ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) IS A CHRONIC DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESSIVE DRINKING AND IS FREQUENTLY COMORBID IN PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH). AUD OFTEN RESULTS IN THE EMERGENCE OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL STATES THAT INFLUENCE THE DESIRE TO CONSUME ALCOHOL, AND ONE POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THESE NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE STATES IN PLWH IS HIV-ASSOCIATED PAINFUL NEUROPATHIES (HIV- N). THUS, THE RATIONALE FOR DRINKING IN PLWH MAY STEM FROM A DESIRE FOR SELF-MEDICATION OF PAIN DUE TO THE ANALGESIC PROPERTIES OF ALCOHOL. IMPORTANTLY, EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE CAN ALSO RESULT IN HYPERALGESIA, A CONDITION THAT MAY BE WORSENED BY HIV-N. PREVIOUS WORK HAS DESCRIBED THE EMERGENCE OF HYPERALGESIA IN ANIMALS MADE DEPENDENT ON ALCOHOL. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION IN A COHORT OF PLWH HAS ALSO REVEALED POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN AUDIT (ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS IDENTIFICATION TEST) SCORES AND CIRCULATING LEVELS OF THE STRESS HORMONE CORTISOL. AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL, THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY OF GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTORS (GRS) IS DIRECTLY CONTROLLED VIA PHOSPHORYLATION STATUS. DYSREGULATION OF GR SIGNALING MAY FACILITATE THE TRANSITION TO AUD AND CONTRIBUTE TO AUD-ASSOCIATED HYPERALGESIA, POTENTIALLY PLAYING A ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT OF HIV-N. FURTHERMORE, CHRONIC PAIN CAN RESULT IN SUPRASPINAL PLASTICITY IN BRAIN AREAS LINKING NOCICEPTION AND NEGATIVE EMOTION, SUCH AS THE CINGULATE CORTEX, WHICH MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OR PROGRESSION OF AUD. IN SUPPORT OF THIS, PRELIMINARY DATA HAS DISCOVERED INCREASES IN GR PHOSPHORYLATION IN THE CINGULATE OF ALCOHOL-DEPENDENT RATS. TO STUDY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALCOHOL AND HIV TO HIV-N, WE\u2019VE UTILIZED AN ESTABLISHED PRECLINICAL RODENT MODEL EMPLOYING PERINEURAL EXPOSURE TO THE HIV ENVELOPE PROTEIN, GLYCOPROTEIN 120 (GP120), WHICH IS CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF HIV-N.

ALCOHOL IS THE MOST ABUSED SUBSTANCE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH ABOUT ONE-QUARTER OF THE ADULT POPULATION PARTAKING IN HEAVY AND/OR BINGE DRINKING. CHRONIC ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION ALSO DISRUPTS GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSULIN RESISTANCE.

PREVIOUSLY OUR LAB HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT CHRONIC ALCOHOL INDUCED LYMPHATIC LEAKAGE, INCREASED CD3+ AND CD4+ T CELLS, FTREGS, AND IL-6 IN PLAT. OUR STUDIES HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT CHRONIC ALCOHOL LED TO DECREASED INSULIN-STIMULATED GLUCOSE UPTAKE IN PLAT.

IN 2020, THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORTED THAT APPROXIMATELY 1 IN 7 PREGNANT WOMEN HAD CONSUMED ALCOHOL IN THE PAST MONTH, WHICH IS IN LINE WITH INCREASING TRENDS SINCE 2011. THUS, PAU IS A MAJOR AND GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM, SO IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE RISK FACTORS FOR PAU TO INFORM PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION. STRESS IS ONE SUCH KEY RISK FACTOR. PREGNANT WOMEN WITH FREQUENT STRESS HAVE A 3- FOLD HIGHER RISK OF BINGE DRINKING THAN PREGNANT WOMEN WITHOUT FREQUENT STRESS. FURTHERMORE, PRE-PREGNANCY ALCOHOL USE IS CONSISTENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PAU, SUGGESTING THAT UNDERSTANDING THE ETIOLOGY OF ALCOHOL MISUSE OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY IS ESSENTIAL FOR PREVENTING PAU. CORRESPONDINGLY, STRESS PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) IN WOMEN OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCY, AS WOMEN ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO RELAPSE FOLLOWING STRESSFUL TRIGGERS RELATIVE TO MEN.

END POINTS INCLUDE CARDIAC FUNCTIONAL MEASURES AND INFLAMMATORY AND FIBROTIC BIOMARKERS IN THE HEART AND IN ISOLATED CARDIAC CELLS. FIRST, WE REDUCE LARP6 IN CARDIAC FIBROBLASTS (USING SHRNA DELIVERED BY A LENTIVIRAL VECTOR) AND USE MUTATED CELLS AND NOVEL MICE LACKING FUNCTIONAL 5\u2019SL COLLAGEN I MRNA (5\u2019SL MICE). THESE INTERVENTIONS PREVENT LARP6 BINDING TO COLLAGEN MRNA.

MIRNAS ARE SMALL NON-CODING RNAS THAT REGULATE GENE EXPRESSION AND ARE DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED BY CBA AND INSULIN RESISTANCE. PRELIMINARY AND PREVIOUS DATA SUGGESTS THAT CBA LEADS TO LOWER EXPRESSION OF THE SKM SPECIFIC MIRNA-206 IN PLASMA EVS AND THE SKM OF SIV-INFECTED MACAQUES, AND MIRNA-206 IS IMPLICATED IN SKM INSULIN-DEPENDENT GLUCOSE UPTAKE. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA AND PUBLISHED LITERATURE SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS, THAT ALCOHOL-MEDIATED ALTERATIONS IN MYOTUBE EXTRACELLULAR VESICLE MIRNA CARGO CONTRIBUTE TO DECREASED MYOTUBE INSULIN SENSITIVITY IN SIV INFECTION. THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL EMPLOY A WIDE VARIETY OF STATE-OF- THE-ART TECHNIQUES TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS USING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) CBA-ADMINISTRATION ALTERS MYOTUBE- DERIVED EV PROFILE IN SIV-INFECTED MACAQUES, AND (2) MYOTUBE-DERIVED EV MIRNA CARGO OF CBA-ADMINISTERED SIV-INFECTED MACAQUES DECREASES MYOTUBE INSULIN SENSITIVITY. FINDINGS FROM THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT ON THE ROLE OF EVS IN ALCOHOL-MEDIATED SKM INSULIN INSENSITIVITY IN SIV INFECTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO ILLUSTRATE THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF EVS IN IMPROVING ALCOHOL-MEDIATED SKM DYSFUNCTION.

EARLY LIFE ALCOHOL USE IS PARTICULARLY UNDERMINING TO BONE HEALTH IN ADULTHOOD AS THE RESULT OF IMPAIRED ATTAINMENT OF PEAK BONE MASS, A CONCERNING FINDING CONSIDERING THE INCREASING RATE OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN ADOLESCENTS. CONFOUNDING THE PROBLEM, ETHANOL ALSO COMPROMISES BONE\u2019S MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, WHICH DECREASES BONE QUALITY AND INCREASES FRACTURE RISK, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF DECREASED BONE MASS. CLINICALLY, MEASUREMENTS OF BONE QUALITY AREN\u2019T IMPLEMENTED, NOR IS THIS ASPECT ROUTINELY CONSIDERED IN BONE DISEASE MANAGEMENT. THE LITERATURE STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT OSTEOCYTES PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING BONE QUALITY, YET THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THESE CELLS AND THEIR PROCESSES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. OSTEOCYTES HAVE BEEN RECENTLY APPRECIATED TO ACTIVELY DEPOSIT AND RESORB BONE IN THEIR MICROENVIRONMENT, A PROCESS CALLED PERILACUNAR/CANALICULAR REMODELING (PLR). PLR MEDIATORS ENSURE PROPER COLLAGEN ORGANIZATION AND BONE MINERALIZATION. FURTHER, OSTEOCYTES ARE PIVOTAL IN BONE HOMEOSTASIS THROUGH THEIR RELEASE OF CELL SPECIFIC PROTEINS, SUCH AS SCLEROSTIN. THIS PROTEIN IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST AS IT INHIBITS A PRO- OSTEOBLASTIC PATHWAY (WNT SIGNALING) THAT IS KNOWN TO BE INHIBITED BY ETHANOL. IMPORTANTLY, SCLEROSTIN ALSO MODULATES PLR, SPECIFICALLY PROMOTING ACIDIFICATION TO ALLOW FOR PERILACUNAR RESORPTION (OSTEOCYTIC OSTEOLYSIS). FINALLY, BOTH PLR AND SCLEROSTIN PRODUCTION ARE REGULATED BY TGF-SS SIGNALING, AN IMPORTANT BONE ANABOLIC PATHWAY KNOWN TO BE DYSREGULATED IN MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASES MARKED BY DECREASED QUALITY. THE STUDIES PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION ARE DESIGNED TO UNCOVER HOW, MECHANISTICALLY, ALCOHOL AFFECTS OSTEOCYTES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE EFFECTS PREVAIL IN A COMPLEX PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEM.

ADOLESCENT DRINKERS REPORT GREATER PREVALENCE OF PAIN DISORDERS IN ADULTHOOD, AND FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING HAS SHOWN GREATER AMYGDALA ACTIVATION COMPARED TO NON-DRINKERS. THE AMYGDALA, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE CENTRAL NUCLEUS OF THE AMYGDALA (CEA) IS A KEY BRAIN REGION IN PAIN PROCESSING BY GLUTAMATE TRANSMISSION FROM PAIN-RELATED BRAIN REGIONS. THE CEA IS SENSITIVE TO ALCOHOL, HOWEVER THERE ARE DIVERGENT RESULTS DEPENDING ON TIMING OF EXPOSURE. IN ADULT RODENT MODELS, CHRONIC ALCOHOL INCREASES CEA ACTIVITY BY UPREGULATING N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE (NMDAR) SUBUNITS AND AMPAR MEDIATED EXCITATORY TRANSMISSION LEADING TO INCREASED PAIN PROCESSING. THESE EFFECTS ARE TRANSIENT, AS CHANGES IN NMDAR SUBUNIT EXPRESSION AND GLUTAMATE TRANSMISSION NORMALIZE WITHIN 1-2 WEEKS FOLLOWING EXPOSURE. IN AN ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL EXPOSURE MODEL, INCREASES IN NMDAR SUBUNIT AND GLUTAMATE SIGNALING LASTS INTO ADULTHOOD IN THE EXTENDED AMYGDALA, SUGGESTING ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL EFFECTS ARE MORE PERSISTENT. THE MELANOCORTIN SYSTEM AND NEURAL SPECIFIC MELANOCORTIN 4 RECEPTOR (MC4R) ARE HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN THE CEA AND REGULATE GLUTAMATERGIC TRANSMISSION. MC4R INCREASES AMPAR POST-SYNAPTICALLY, MODULATES NMDAR FUNCTION, AND INCREASES GLUTAMATE SIGNALING IN OTHER PAIN-RELATED REGIONS. MELANOCORTIN SIGNALING IN THE AMYGDALA MODULATES PAIN-RELATED BEHAVIORS AS INTRA-CEA MC4R ANTAGONISM REVERSES ALCOHOL-INDUCED HYPERALGESIA IN ADULT RATS. ADULT ALCOHOL EXPOSURE DECREASES MC4R EXPRESSION, BUT ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL EXPOSURE INCREASES MC4R EXPRESSION IN ADULTHOOD. HOW THE MELANOCORTIN SYSTEM MODULATES GLUTAMATE TRANSMISSION IN THE CEA, THE LONGITUDINAL EFFECTS OF ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL ON CEA GLUTAMATE AND MELANOCORTIN SYSTEMS, AND HOW THE MELANOCORTIN SYSTEM MODULATES PAIN PROCESSING LONGITUDINALLY HAVE YET TO BE ADDRESSED. USING A RAT MODEL, WE WILL TEST THE EFFECT OF ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL EXPOSURE ON MELANOCORTIN AND GLUTAMATERGIC SIGNALING IN CEA, THE EFFECT OF CHRONIC MC4R ANTAGONISM ON CELLULAR EFFECTS DURING THIS PERIOD, AND WE WILL TEST MC4R ANTAGONISM DURING ADULTHOOD ON HYPERALGESIA INDUCED BY AN ADOLESCENT INTERMITTENT ETHANOL (AIE) VAPOR MODEL. MALE AND FEMALE WISTAR RATS WILL RECEIVE ALCOHOL VAPOR FROM POSTNATAL DAY (PND) 28 TO PND 56, WITH ONE COHORT RECEIVING CHRONIC MC4R ANTAGONISM VIA INTRACEREBROVENTRICULAR MINIPUMPS DURING THIS PERIOD. WE WILL USE WESTERN BLOTS TO MEASURE AMPAR AND NMDAR SUBUNITS, AND MELANOCORTIN SYSTEM PROTEIN EXPRESSION ACUTELY AFTER AIE (PND 56) AND DURING ADULTHOOD (PND 86). WE WILL USE SLICE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY TO MEASURE GLUTAMATERGIC TRANSMISSION IN THE CEA DURING ADOLESCENCE AND ADULTHOOD, AND ITS MODULATION BY MC4R DRUGS.

MALISON YALE-CHULALONGKORN STRESS, ALCOHOL USE AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY TRAINING PROGRAM - ABSTRACT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS ARE A SET OF CHRONIC, NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCDS), A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM OF ENORMOUS ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND MEDICAL COST TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. STRESS, ALCOHOL USE AND OTHER FACTORS (SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL; PHYSICAL DISORDERS) OFTEN EXACERBATE PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED DUE TO BOTH ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGES AND THE LESS WELL-ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES DEDICATED TO THE UNDERSTANDING, TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY. WE PROPOSE A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM IN THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY, TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OF STRESS, ALCOHOL USE AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY BETWEEN FACULTY OF MEDICINE, CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY IN BANGKOK, THAILAND (THE LEAD THAI SITE) PHRAMONGKUTKLAO (PMK) HOSPITAL, ALSO IN BANGKOK, AND PRINCE OF SONGKLA UNIVERSITY (PSU) IN HAT YAI, THAILAND; AND THE YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN THE U.S. THE PROJECT IS DIRECTED BY LEADERS IN THAILAND AND THE US, DR. KALAYASIRI AT CHULALONGKORN, AND DRS. POTENZA AND GELERNTER AT YALE, MPIS FOR THIS APPLICATION. THREE MAJOR TRAINING MECHANISMS ARE PROPOSED FOR THAI TRAINEES, INCLUDING LONG- TERM (1-2-YR) PREDOCTORAL AND POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS, AND SHORT-TERM (1-6 MONTH) FELLOWSHIPS. DURING THE FIVE- YEAR PROGRAM, TRAINING RESPONSIBILITY INCREASES AT CHULALONGKORN, PMK, AND PSU (AS EXPERIENCE BUILDS) AND DECREASES AT YALE. THIS PROGRAM BUILDS ON AN EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM IN PSYCHIATRY AT YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, AND ON EXISTING TRAINING AND RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN INVESTIGATORS AT YALE AND INVESTIGATORS AT CHULALONGKORN IN THE STUDY OF THE GENETICS AND CLINICAL CORRELATES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY (ESPECIALLY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS) IN THAI POPULATIONS. THE PROGRAM WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CAPACITY OF INVESTIGATORS AT CHULALONGKORN, PMK AND PSU AND MORE GENERALLY IN THAILAND TO CONDUCT STATE-OF-THE-ART RESEARCH IN INTERDISCIPLINARY AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHIATRY THROUGH A RANGE OF TRAINING EXPERIENCES (GENETICS, MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, CLINICAL, DEVELOPMENTAL, PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY, CLINICAL TRIALS, NEUROIMAGING, IMPLEMENTATION, COMMUNITY, AND POLICY RESEARCH); AND HAS STRONG ONGOING POTENTIAL FOR CLINICAL TRANSLATION. THE EXPLICIT LONG-TERM GOAL OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE TO BUILD A CRITICAL MASS OF SCIENTISTS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, AND ACADEMICS WITH EXPERTISE AND A SUSTAINABLE RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT AT THE COLLABORATING THAI INSTITUTIONS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND, TREAT, AND PREVENT THE NCDS OF PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESSES. THIS TRAINING PROGRAM IS ALSO SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SERVE A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSE BY ENHANCING THAILAND\u2019S CAPACITY TO CONFRONT MAJOR HEALTH CONCERNS INCLUDING ALCOHOL AND OTHER STRESS-RELATED DISORDERS THAT ARE UNPRECEDENTED IN THAILAND\u2019S HISTORY. THE CONTEXT OF THIS PROGRAM IS A LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND TRAINING COLLABORATION BETWEEN YALE AND CHULALONGKORN THAT FOCUSED ON DRUG DEPENDENCE WHICH WAS CO-LED BY AT YALE BY DRS. GELERNTER AND MALISON. THIS NEW PROGRAM WITH A NEW FOCUS IS EXPANDED IN SCOPE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THAILAND BETTER AND INCLUDE A THAI MPI, AND IS NOW NAMED \u201cTHE ROBERT T.
