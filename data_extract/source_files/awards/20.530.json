FOR REGIONAL INTEGRATION TO BE POSSIBLE ALL OF THE DRT SOFTWARE SYSTEMS MUST BE CAPABLE OF INTEROPERATING WITH THE REGIONAL LEVEL PLATFORM SO THAT THE COLLECTIVE SET OF TRANSPORTATION RESOURCES CAN BE UTILIZED FOR TRIP REQUESTS. THE CURRENT INABILITY OF DIFFERENT DRT TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO INTEROPERATE MEANS THAT A REGION WITH MULTIPLE DRT SERVICES CANNOT IMPLEMENT AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO BOOKING SCHEDULING AND DELIVERING DEMAND RESPONSIVE FORMS OF PUBLIC TRANSIT. LACK OF SUCH STANDARDS-BASED INTERFACE HAS BEEN A MAJOR BARRIER FOR EFFICIENT MOBILITY MANAGEMENT AS DOCUMENTED IN CASE STUDIES OF MOBILITY SERVICE FOR ALL AMERICAN (MSAA) GRANTEES.

THE DRAFT REPORT WILL INCLUDE DASHBOARD DATA ON RIDERSHIP AND USE OF THE ROCSS CAPABILITY CUSTOMER FEEDBACK AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE ROCSS AND RELEASE AT OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: MONTGOMERY COUNTY RESIDENTS THAT USE TRANSIT SERVICES. THE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IN THE MARYLAND AREA WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MORE PROVEN REAL-TIME INFORMATION ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SEATS ON TRANSIT SERVICE THAT ARE APPROPRIATELY SOCIALLY DISTANCED FROM OTHERS OUTSIDE THEIR FAMILY GROUP. BY USING THIS SAME DATA TO STRATEGICALLY ADD VEHICLES FOR SERVICE WHEN NEEDED DUE TO OVERCROWDING MORE SAFE TRANSIT OPTIONS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO RIDERS IN A USER-FRIENDLY FORMAT. AND THE EVENT THAT ALL BUSES WERE OPERATING AT CAPACITY FOR THE SITUATION THIS SAME USER-FRIENDLY APP WOULD ALLOW THE RIDERS TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE TRANSIT OPTION IN THE AREA FOR THEIR TRAVEL DESTINATION. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO SERVE AS A DEMONSTRATION OF ALTERNATIVE TRIP PLANNING FOR OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES.; SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: BELOW ARE THE PROJECT ACTIVITIES THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MOOVIT AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO RESEARCH DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE REAL-TIME CROWD SOURCING TO THE PUBLIC VIA A SMARTPHONE APP.

THE GOAL OF THE BRATS ON DEMAND PROJECT IS TO 1) PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TRANSIT SYSTEMS THAT SERVE RURAL COMMUNITIES CAN SUCCESSFULLY CONNECT AND SERVE THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH A MOBILITY ON DEMAND SERVICE MODEL AND B) TO DEMONSTRATE THAT DEPLOYMENT IN BALDWIN COUNTYS SERVICE AREA. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL PROVIDE FULLY ON-DEMAND SERVICE FOR ANY TRIPS STARTING AND ENDING WITHIN ONE OF THE FOUR HIGHER-DENSITY ZONES IN BALDWIN COUNTY. THIS WILL ALLOW THESE RESIDENTS TO BOOK RIDES AT ANY TIME ALLOWING FOR ERRANDS TRAVEL TO EDUCATION JOBS HEALTHCARE AND MORE. BALDWIN COUNTY ALSO EXPERIENCES REGULAR TRAVEL BETWEEN EACH OF THESE MAJOR ZONES. THESE TRIPS MANY OF WHICH RIDERS TAKE ON A DAILY BASIS TO COMMUTE TAKE UP TO AN HOUR OR MORE EACH WAY. THE AIM IS FOR RIDERS TO BE ABLE TO BOOK TRIPS DIRECTLY FROM THEIR ORIGIN TO THEIR DESTINATION ACROSS ZONES BY PRE-BOOKING TRIPS AT LEAST THREE HOURS IN ADVANCE. BY PRE-BOOKING THESE TRIPS THE SOFTWARE ALGORITHMS WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER AGGREGATE PASSENGERS TRAVELING IN SIMILAR DIRECTIONS ENSURING THE MOST EFFICIENT AND FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE SERVICE POSSIBLE. WE BELIEVE THIS APPROACH WILL BE IDEAL FOR RURAL AREAS AS IT MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF RIDES PER VEHICLE. THE BRATS ON DEMAND PROJECT WILL ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH VIA TRANSPORTATION AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN MOBILITY ON DEMAND RIDESHARING TECHNOLOGY. BALDWIN COUNTY WILL PROVIDE THE VEHICLES AND SERVICES WHILE VIA WILL PROVIDE THE TECHNOLOGY AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE TO POWER THE RURAL MOD SYSTEM. VIAS MOBILITY EXPERTS HAVE GUIDED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERS AROUND THE WORLD THROUGH THE COMPLEX EXERCISE OF PLANNING AN MOD DEPLOYMENT. THROUGH THESE SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCES VIA HAS DEVELOPED AND REFINED A FIVE-STEP PROCESS THAT SHAPES PARTNER GOALS INTO A CONCRETE PLAN THAT BALANCES SERVICE COVERAGE COSTS AND RIDER EXPERIENCE. VIAS ITERATIVE FEEDBACK-BASED APPROACH ENSURES THAT PARTNERS EXPLORE ALL ON-DEMAND SERVICE OPTIONS AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO DESIGN A SERVICE THAT EXPANDS ACCESS TO MOBILITY IN TARGET COMMUNITIES INCREASES TRANSIT RIDERSHIP AND PROMOTES ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. VIAS EXPERTS HAVE THOUGHT THROUGH SERVICE PLANNING CHALLENGES IN VIRTUALLY EVERY KIND OF ENVIRONMENT: BIG CITIES SMALL TOWNS IN RURAL AREAS AND CAR-ORIENTED SUBURBS. FOR ANY NEW ON-DEMAND TRANSIT SERVICE VIAS PLANNERS FOLLOW A WELL-DEVELOPED METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING CONTEXT-SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROCESS VIA HAS DEVELOPED SOPHISTICATED TOOLS THAT ALLOW THEM TO EXPLORE MANY PERMUTATIONS OF SERVICE DESIGN AND THE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN EFFICIENCY AND RIDER EXPERIENCE IN A GIVEN GEOGRAPHY. VIA WILL LEVERAGE ITS EXPERTISE TO DEVELOP DEPLOY AND TEST PRE-BOOKING TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL PROVIDE A CRITICAL LINK FOR ON-DEMAND DEPLOYMENTS IN RURAL AREAS.THE BRATS ON DEMAND PROJECTS INTENDED IMPACTS ARE: 1) VALIDATE THE FEASIBILITY OF RURAL MOD BUSINESS MODELS AND DOCUMENT BEST PRACTICES EMERGING FROM THE DEMONSTRATION. AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS VIA AND BALDWIN COUNTY WILL DEVELOP A DETAILED AND ACTIONABLE LAUNCH PLAN INCLUDING SPECIFIC STEPS FOR: 1) SYSTEM LOCALIZATION 2) MOBILE APPLICATION AND FEATURE CONFIGURATION 3) DRIVER TRAINING 4) SUPPORT TEAM TRAINING 4) SERVICE MARKETING AND BRANDING.2) MEASURE THE IMPACT OF MOD ON RURAL COMMUNITIES. BALDWIN COUNTY WILL WORK WITH VIA TO ENSURE A FULL SUITE OF PROJECT DATA IS AVAILABLE TO TRACK EVALUATE AND IMPROVE EACH ELEMENT OF THE DEPLOYMENT. THE DATA GATHERED WILL BE ANALYZED TO UNDERSTAND AT A GRANULAR LEVEL HOW THIS SERVICE CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE COUNTYS RESIDENTS ENSURING THAT PROVIDED RIDES DELIVER EVERY ELEMENT OF A COMPLETE TRIP. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO ADVANCE THE TRANSIT INDUSTRYS ADOPTION OF MOD ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS AND FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED PERSONAL MOBILITY.3) INCREASED ACCESS FOR SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED PERSONAL MOBILITY. WITH NEW RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED PERSONAL MOBILITY WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE LONGER HEALTHIER AND HAPPIER LIVES IN BALDWIN COUNTY. THROUGH A USER-FRIENDLY ON-DEMAND AND FULLY ACCESSIBLE SERVICE THAT COMES TO THEM WHEN THEY WANT IT BRATS ON DEMAND WILL PROVIDE THESE RIDERS WITH AN ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL OF ACCESS TO JOBS HEALTHCARE PLACES OF WORSHIP FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND ALL OTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES. FURTHER THIS INCREASED MOBILITY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO AGING IN PLACE ALLOWING SENIORS TO LIVE AT HOME FOR LONGER EVEN IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO DRIVE. 4) INCREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND COMPETITIVENESS. THESE BENEFITS WILL GO BEYOND SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED MOBILITY ALONE. WE ENVISION THAT THIS INCREASE IN MOBILITY FOR ALL RIDERS WILL STIMULATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WITH MORE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ABLE TO GO OUT TO DINNER SEE A MOVIE OR PARTICIPATE IN OTHER RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES WITHOUT A CAR. THIS INCREASED ACCESS TO DOWNTOWN AND OTHER REGIONAL AMENITIES WILL BOOST LOCAL BUSINESS HELPING BALDWIN COUNTY BECOME A MORE ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE REGION. IN PARALLEL TO THESE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES THE PROJECT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE OUTCOMES SUCH AS IMPROVED HEALTH DUE TO RESIDENTS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS APPOINTMENTS ON TIME EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT DUE TO RESIDENTS BEING ABLE TO MORE EASILY REACH SCHOOL AND JOB PERFORMANCE DUE TO THE INCREASE IN RELIABLE CAR-FREE COMMUTING.5) REDUCED OPERATIONAL COSTS. THE PROPOSED ON-DEMAND MODEL WILL BE A FLEXIBLE AND EFFICIENT TRANSIT SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS PARTNERS TO SAVE ON OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES BY DEPLOYING A RIGHT-SIZED FLEET OF RIGHT-SIZED VEHICLES ACCORDING TO GRANULAR DEMAND DATA.
