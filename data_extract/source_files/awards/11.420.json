THE FIELD STATION PROVIDES OFFICE SPACE FOR NERR STEWARDSHIP AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF, DORMS FOR VISITING RESEARCHERS, EDUCATORS, AND PARTNERS, INDOOR AND OUTDOOR CLASSROOMS, A LABORATORY, THE RESERVE'S METEOROLOGICAL STATION, AND A DOCK THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE SEVERAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION VESSELS AT A TIME. THE FIELD STATION SERVES AS THE \"GATEWAY TO THE ACE BASIN\" AS ONE OF THE ONLY PUBLIC FACILITIES IN THE HEART OF THE RESERVE. THE STATION IS A CORE FACILITY THAT IS CRITICAL TO THE RESERVE'S MISSION, AND THE RESERVE\nOPERATES WITH A MANDATE TO PROVIDE THIS FACILITY AND ITS ASSOCIATED SERVICES. THE FATE OF THIS FACILITY AND ITS ASSOCIATED ASSETS INCLUDING THE DOCK ARE THREATENED BY SEVERE AND ONGOING SHORELINE EROSION ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE PROPERTY ADJACENT TO MOSQUITO CREEK.\nTHE SHORELINE EROSION IS A RESULT OF GEOMORPHOLOGY AND IS EXACERBATED BY SEA LEVEL RISE. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE SHORELINE EROSION THROUGH A SHORELINE STABILIZATION PROJECT THAT UTILIZES A HYBRID APPROACH INCORPORATING BOTH TRADITIONAL EROSION CONTROL MEASURES AS WELL AS\nNATURE-BASED ALTERNATIVES KNOWN AS LIVING SHORELINES. THIS HYBRID APPROACH WILL OFFER THE HIGHEST AND MOST LONG-TERM LEVEL OF PROTECTION OF CRITICAL ASSETS WHILE INCORPORATING HABITAT-IMPROVEMENT AND OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS APPROACH WILL HELP TO ACHIEVE RESILIENCE OF THE STATION AND ITS INFRASTRUCTURE AND ASSETS, RESERVE PROGRAMMING, AS WELL AS NATURAL HABITATS ALONG THE SHORELINE. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROTECT THE MCKENZIE FIELD STATION AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND ASSETS BY STABILIZING THE HIGHLY EROSIONAL SHORELINE FRONTAGE ALONG MOSQUITO CREEK. ULTIMATELY,\nTHE GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN THE SERVICES AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO STAFF, PARTNERS, AND THE PUBLIC IN THE ACE BASIN TO FURTHER THE RESERVE'S MISSION. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO\nACHIEVE SHORELINE STABILIZATION THROUGH A HYBRID APPROACH THAT BOTH PROTECTS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORTS HABITATS AND BIODIVERSITY. AN ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE IS FOR BOTH THE SHORELINE STABILIZATION CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS ITS LONG-TERM PRESENCE AT THE FIELD STATION TO SERVE AS\nEDUCATIONAL AND OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES FOR A VARIETY OF AUDIENCES.\nTHE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE A STABILIZED SHORELINE ALONG MOSQUITO CREEK SPANNING THE MCKENZIE FIELD STATION PROPERTY. THE SHORELINE WILL PROTECT THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS INVOLVED AT THE MCKENZIE FIELD STATION SITE, AS WELL AS PRESERVE THE RESERVE'S ABILITY TO PERFORM ITS CORE RESEARCH, STEWARDSHIP, AND EDUCATION FUNCTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROJECT WILL RESULT IN OUTREACH PRODUCTS INCLUDING INTERPRETIVE SIGNAGE, TRAININGS, AND A LASTING DEMONSTRATION SITE.
