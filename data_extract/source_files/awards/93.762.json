PREVENTABLE DISEASES IMPACT AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE (AI/AN) POPULATIONS AT A FAR GREATER RATE THAN THEY IMPACT THE REST OF AMERICANS. IN THE GPA, CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND DIABETES ARE AMONG THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH FOR AI/ANS. POVERTY IS A SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH FOR THE AI/AN POPULATION, AND TRIBES IN THE GREAT PLAINS HOLD SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES IN THE NATION. TRIBES ARE LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN DATA COLLECTION, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND/OR SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES AND OFTEN DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO EMPLOY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN THESE AREAS. THEREFORE, STRENGTHENING THE PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY OF TRIBES IS INTEGRAL TO REDUCING DISPARITIES, ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, AND IMPROVING OVERALL AI/AN HEALTH.

TO REACH THIS 5-YEAR GOAL, OUR PROPOSED PROJECT ACTIVITIES EACH AIM TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR CULTURAL TEACHINGS AND PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE HEALTH AND WELLNESS. WE PLAN TO DO THIS THROUGH THREE DISTINCT STRATEGIES: STRATEGY 2: ESTABLISH AN ANNUAL COMMUNITY CALENDAR OF SEASONAL CULTURAL AND TRADITIONAL EVENTS, CELEBRATIONS AND ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT AND REINFORCE HEALTHY PRACTICES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE WILL EMULATE INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE AND LANGUAGE THROUGH FIELD TRIPS THEMED BY CYCLICAL, SEASONALLY APPROPRIATE HUNTING, GATHERING, HARVESTING, AND PRESERVATION METHODS OF THE FORT PECK ASSINIBOINE & SIOUX TRIBES COMMUNITY.OUR PROJECT STAFF WILL CONDUCT WEEKLY FIELD TRIPS THEMED ON PLANNING, OBSERVING, HUNTING, HARVESTING, PLANTING, OR CRAFTING. WEEKLY ACTIVITIES WILL BE BASED ON CYCLES OF SEASONS AND THE APPROPRIATE TIMES OF THE YEAR FOR EACH ACTIVITY (SEE Y1 WORKPLAN PROPOSAL FOR DETAILED THEMES). WE WILL SURVEY THE FORT PECK BUFFALO RANCH & LANDSCAPE FOR PLANTS & MEDICINES, AND COLLECT INFORMATION ON TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE AND ANNUAL CYCLES TO ASSEMBLE A SEASONAL, CYCLICAL CALENDAR OF NATURAL-WORLD OBSERVATION, PLANT/MEDICINE HARVESTING, HUNTING, AND PRESERVATION PRACTICES STRATEGY 4: ESTABLISH OR STRENGTHEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADULTS AND ELDERS TO PASS ON TRIBAL, CULTURAL, AND OTHER KNOWLEDGE TO CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE, AND TO OTHER ADULTS AND ELDERS WITHIN THE FORT PECK ASSINBOINE & SIOUX TRIBES COMMUNITY. WE WILL UTILIZE THE FPCC BUFFALO CHASERS PODCAST SERIES IN AN EFFORT TO INCLUDE TOPICS THAT DISCUSS THE WHOLE HEALTH BENEFITS OF RE-ESTABLISHING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GROWING, GATHERING, AND HARVESTING OF BOTH TRADITIONAL AND MODERN FOODS AND THE IMPACT OUR RE-CONNECTING CAN HAVE ON OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR ELDERS AND CHILDREN. SECONDLY, WE WILL BOLSTER THE FORT PECK TRIBAL SEED LIBRARY BY SPONSORING ACCESS TO AN ONLINE SEED SCHOOL (E.G., SEED SAVERS, ROCKY MOUNTAIN SEED ALLIANCE) FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO TAKE AS AN ANNUAL COHORT. THE COHORT MODEL WILL ALLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO LEARN TOGETHER WHILE SHARING THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES SO THAT THE TRIBAL SEED LIBRARY MIGHT GAIN ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE TO ONE DAY HOST ITS OWN FORT PECK-FOCUSED SEED SCHOOL IN OUR COMMUNITIES, TAUGHT BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. STRATEGY 5: PARTNER WITH TRIBAL, INTER-TRIBAL, GOVERNMENTAL, AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES TO PRODUCE AND PROMOTE TRADITIONAL DIETS, INCLUDING FOODS AND DRINKS TO SUSTAIN HEALTH. FINALLY, WE WILL BOLSTER PRE-EXISTING COMMUNITY GARDENING ACTIVITIES THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FORT PECK TRIBES COMMUNITY SERVICES GARDEN TO FACILITATE TRADITIONAL GATHERING/HARVESTING OF FOODS TO STRENGTHEN THE TRIBAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM OF THE FORT PECK ASSINIBOINE & SIOUX TRIBES COMMUNITY. WE WILL ENHANCE THE CURRENT COMMUNITY GARDEN PROGRAM TO INCLUDE MORE TRADITIONAL SEED, PLANT, AND FOOD OFFERINGS TO TRIBAL AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

SDAIHC ALSO NOW OPERATES AS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) UNDER SECTION 330 OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES ACT.
