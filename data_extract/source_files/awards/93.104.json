INDIVIDUALS SERVED IN THE PROGRAM WILL BE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 14 AND 25. INDIVIDUALS SERVED WILL COME FROM ALL AREAS OF THE CATCHMENT (FAIRFAX COUNTY, CITIES OF FAIRFAX AND FALLS CHURCH, AND TOWNS OF VIENNA AND HERNDON). INDIVIDUALS SERVED WOULD BE EXPECTED TO REPRESENT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE COMMUNITY - 61% ARE WHITE, 10% ARE BLACK, 19% ARE ASIA/PACIFIC ISLANDERS, 10% ARE OTHER/MULTI-RACIAL AND 16% ARE HISPANIC. THESE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE EXHIBITING PRE-PSYCHOSIS SYMPTOMS INCLUDING NOTICEABLE CHANGES IN PERCEPTION, THINKING OR FUNCTIONING THAT MAY BE ACCOMPANIED BY ATTENUATED SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOSIS, BRIEF EPISODES OF PSYCHOSIS, OR HAVE A KNOWN FIRST-DEGREE RELATIVE WITH PSYCHOSIS. SERVICES WOULD START WITH ONCE WEEKLY OUTPATIENT INDIVIDUAL THERAPY, AND CAN BE STEPPED UP TO MORE INTENSE SERVICES TO INCLUDE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT, GROUP AND FAMILY PSYCHOTHERAPY, EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTS, AND PEER SUPPORT. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE PROGRAM WILL SERVE AT LEAST 35 INDIVIDUALS EACH YEAR, OR 140 OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT'S GOALS ARE TO: EDUCATE AT LEAST 300 INDIVIDUALS ABOUT EARLY PSYCHOSIS SCREENING AND INTERVENTION OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT, IDENTIFY AND SCREEN 400 INDIVIDUALS (100 ANNUALLY) FOR PSYCHOSIS-RISK SYNDROMES OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT, AND PROVIDE AT LEAST ONE SESSION OF FAMILY PSYCHOEDUCATION TO AT LEAST 140 FAMILIES OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT. THROUGH INTERVENTION AND SUPPORT, THE CHRP PROGRAM EXPECTS THAT 85% OF INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED WOULD BE ABLE TO BE ENGAGED IN EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES OR EMPLOYMENT. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THROUGH EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY INTERVENTION THROUGH A STEPPED-CARE MODEL, THAT FEWER THAN 10% OF INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED WOULD CONVERT TO A FIRST EPISODE OF PSYCHOSIS.

BY ENHANCING AND EXPANDING THE TCC SOC MODEL, WE WILL PREVENT AND REDUCE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF TRAUMA AND HISTORICAL TRAUMA; THEREBY IMPROVING OVERALL COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH THROUGHOUT THE YUKON KOYUKUK SUB-REGION. OUR PROJECT HAS FOUR PRIMARY GOALS. FIRST, THIS PROJECT WILL SOLIDIFY THE TCC SOC MODEL FOR REPLICATION THROUGHOUT THE YK SUBREGION BY INTEGRATING SOC PRINCIPLES (INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION, INDIVIDUALIZED STRENGTHS-BASED, CULTURALLY COMPETENT, INVOLVING FAMILY AND YOUTH, COMMUNITY-BASED, AND ACCOUNTABLE) THROUGHOUT THE TCC SOC POLICIES AND PRACTICES. WE WILL REVIEW POLICIES AND SYSTEMS RELATED TO: TCC BH SERVICES, LOCAL CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM, LOCAL ADVISORY COUNCIL, PARENT/FAMILY ACTIVITIES, YOUTH ACTIVITIES, WHOLE FAMILY APPROACH, ADVISORY BOARD, AND DEVELOPING MOAS WITH PARTNERS. SECOND, WE WILL EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY CAPACITY TO SUPPORT YOUTH AT RISK AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE BELIEVE THAT CULTURAL HEALING WILL STRENGTHEN OUR REGION\u2019S CAPACITY TO SUPPORT YOUTH AT RISK AND THEIR FAMILIES. CULTURAL HEALING IS EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF HISTORICAL TRAUMA ON THE COMMUNITY, FAMILIES, AND OUR WAY OF LIFE; ASKING THE COMMUNITY WHAT WERE THE TRAUMATIC EVENTS THAT OCCURRED HERE? HOW DID THE COMMUNITY RESPOND? WHAT WERE THE RESILIENCY STRATEGIES THAT ALLOWED THE COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE? WHAT IS HEALTHY LIVING FROM AN INDIGENOUS ALASKA NATIVE APPROACH. OUR OBJECTIVES FOCUS ON FACILITATING CULTURAL HEALING. CULTURAL HEALING IS CONNECTING PEOPLE TO THEIR CULTURAL IDENTIFY THROUGH UNDERSTANDING TRADITIONS, CUSTOMS, AND PRACTICES. THIRD, WE WILL IMPROVE SERVICES FOCUSED ON ENGAGING FAMILY AND COMMUNITY IN HIGH-QUALITY, EFFECTIVE, CULTURALLY COMPETENT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOCUSES ON PROVIDING MECHANISMS TO INCREASE PARENTAL/FAMILY COLLABORATION TO ENHANCE YOUTH OUTCOMES. THIS GOAL WILL ADDRESS AN IMPORTANT GAP WE IDENTIFIED: MOST FAMILIES DO NOT ENGAGE IN SERVICES WHEN THEIR CHILD IS RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN FAMILIES ENGAGE IN SERVICES WITH THEIR CHILDREN THE CHILD AND FAMILY\u2019S OUTCOMES IMPROVE. OUR OBJECTIVES DESCRIBE THE IMPACT WE BELIEVE WILL OCCUR FOR YOUTH WHEN WE PROVIDE WHOLE FAMILY SERVICES AND TRAINING TO PARENTS, FAMILY MEMBERS, AND COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF YOUTH ENTERING AND COMPLETING THERAPY AND PARTICIPATING IN NON-TRADITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. FINALLY, WE WILL ENHANCE, EXPAND, AND SUSTAIN TRAINING TO SUPPORT TCC SOC MODEL IN THE TCC REGION TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL LACK OF ACCESS TO A SPECTRUM OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AT RISK OR WITH SED AND THEIR FAMILIES IN OUR SOC COMMUNITIES. OUR OBJECTIVES ARE FOCUSED ON TRAINING SOC STAFF TO BUILD COMMUNITY CAPACITY, ENSURE COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES, AND TO IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES WITH CONSISTENT FIDELITY. TCC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES (BHS) WILL PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN WITH SED THAT REFLECT PRINCIPLES OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE.

MA WILL EXPAND ITS EIGHT-CITY NETWORK OF YOUNG ADULT ACCESS CENTERS TO TWO ADDITIONAL CITIES. THESE CENTERS OFFER PEER SUPPORT AND ARE LOW-THRESHOLD HUBS FOR ENGAGING YAS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, WHILE OFFERING A WELCOMING, FUN AND SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY.  THE MA DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH (DMH) RECOGNIZES THAT OLDER TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCES (SED) HAVE UNIQUE DEVELOPMENTAL AND CLINICAL NEEDS AND ARE OFTEN CHALLENGING TO ENGAGE, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO FACE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES OF HOUSING INSECURITY, LOW EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT. DMH HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH YA TO DESIGN, IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUNG ADULT ACCESS CENTERS THAT OFFER SUPPORTS THAT ARE TAILORED TO YA PREFERENCES AND NEEDS AND RESPONSIVE TO THE DIVERSE CULTURES IN THE COMMUNITY. IN NON-COVID TIMES, ACCESS CENTERS PROVIDE A PHYSICAL LOCATION WHERE IT IS COMFORTABLE FOR YA TO DROP IN. THEY ARE STAFFED BY TRAINED PEERS, WHO ASSERTIVELY REACH OUT TO YA DISCONNECTED FROM SERVICES, ENGAGE THEM IN WRAPAROUND PLANNING, AND ASSIST THEM TO ACCESS NEEDED MH, SUD, AND HEALTH TREATMENT, HOUSING, EDUCATION, AND EMPLOYMENT. ADDITIONALLY, DMH RECOGNIZES THAT FOR MANY OF THESE YA, REBUILDING CONNECTIONS WITH FAMILIES AND OTHER NATURAL SUPPORTS CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO THEIR RECOVERY AND WELLNESS. ACCESS CENTERS STRIVE TO ENGAGE FAMILIES WITH THE CONSENT OF THE YAS. WITH COVID, ACCESS CENTERS ARE USING ZOOM AND PHONE CONTACT TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YAS, WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A HIGHER DEGREE OF DISTRESS AND SUICIDE AND OVERDOSE RISK. CLINICAL CONSULTANTS WILL SUPPORT THE TEAMS TO NAVIGATE THESE CHALLENGES.  THE COMMONWEALTH HAS CHOSEN TWO CITIES, CHELSEA AND NEW BEDFORD TO BE SITES FOR NEW ACCESS CENTERS. BOTH ARE CITIES WITH HIGH LATINX POPULATIONS, MANY OF THEM RECENT IMMIGRANTS. BOTH EXPERIENCE HIGH RATES OF POVERTY AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE COVID PANDEMIC. CHELSEA HAS HAD THE HIGHEST RATE OF COVID INFECTIONS, AND NEW BEDFORD HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF OPIATE RELATED DEATHS IN THE STATE. YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN STRUGGLING WITH UNEMPLOYMENT, HOUSING INSECURITY AND FOOD INSECURITY ARE ALSO NOW INCREASINGLY ISOLATED.  THE GOAL OF YA ACCESS CENTERS IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF YA WITH MH AND CO-OCCURRING SUD AT HIGH RISK WHO ENGAGE IN WRAPAROUND PLANNING AND ACCESS CHILD AND ADULT SERVICES ON THEIR OWN TERMS AND IN SERVICE OF THEIR OWN GOALS. AFTER START-UP, THE CENTERS EXPECT TO SERVE 100-150 ANNUALLY OR 400-600 IN TOTAL. IN ADDITION, THE CENTERS WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE DMH AREA OFFICES TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF LOCAL SERVICE SYSTEMS TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF YA.
