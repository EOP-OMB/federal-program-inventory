THIS EFFORT EMPLOYS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRIAL EXPERTS TO EXPLORE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE POTENTIAL OF SMALL REAL-TIME GEOMETRIC OUTER MOLD LINE (OML) RECONFIGURATIONS TO MINIMIZE BOOM SIGNATURES AND DRAG IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING AMBIENT CONDITIONS. THIS WILL ENABLE NOISE-COMPLIANT SST FLIGHT FROM TAKEOFF TO LANDING. OUR TEAM EXPLOITS ADVANCES IN LOW-VOLUME ENERGY-DENSE SOLID-STATE SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY (SMA) ACTUATORS  THE MODELING THEREOF  PROVEN SUPERSONIC COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMIC METHODS  AND SONIC BOOM PROPAGATION TOOLS TO CONSIDER EMBEDDED SOLUTIONS FOR IN SITU ADJUSTMENT OF AN SST AIRCRAFT FOR AN OPTIMAL LOW BOOM SIGNATURE AND LOW DRAG IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH EFFORTS HAVE SHOWN THAT SMALL DISTRIBUTED CHANGES IN SST OML CAN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE PERCEIVED SONIC BOOM NOISE WITHOUT NEGATIVELY AFFECTING AERODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER  SIGNATURES OPTIMIZED THROUGH OML SHAPING AT A SINGLE FLIGHT CONDITION DEGRADE RAPIDLY WITH SLIGHT CHANGES IN FLIGHT CONDITION. ANGLE OF ATTACK  ALTITUDE  AIR DENSITY  AND SPEED ARE KNOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT BOOM SIGNATURE AND SST FLIGHT PERFORMANCE  ENDANGERING TRUE COMMERCIAL VIABILITY OF OVERLAND SUPERSONIC FLIGHT. TO BE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE  A SST MUST ROBUSTLY MEET BOOM SIGNATURE LIMITS FOR A RANGE OF FLIGHT CONDITIONS AND THUS REQUIRES REAL-TIME ADAPTABILITY. THE NOVEL MULTIDISCIPLINARY AND STRUCTURALLY INTEGRATED EFFORT EXPLORES NEW ENGINEERING TOOLS AND MATERIALS DEMONSTRATING THAT DISTRIBUTED STRUCTURAL ADAPTIVITY CAN ENABLE ROBUST LOW BOOM SST PERFORMANCE IN VARYING CONDITIONS  AND THUS DEVELOPS TECHNOLOGIES TO ENABLE COMMUNITY-ACCEPTED SST AIRCRAFT. OUR TEAM WAS CAREFULLY CHOSEN TO ADDRESS THIS UNIQUE AERONAUTICS PROBLEM  IS STRONG IN EACH IMPORTANT TECHNICAL AREA  AND IS SYNERGISTIC ACROSS MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES AND IDENTIFIED CHALLENGES. THE TEXAS A&M LEADERSHIP IS NATURAL FOR THIS EFFORT GIVEN ITS MANY PREVIOUS INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH SUCCESSES AND LONG HISTORY OF SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES DEVELOPMENTS AND SUPERSONICS/HYPERSONICS EXPLORATION. PARTNER INSTITUTIONS (FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY  PRINCETON  UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS  UTAH STATE) WERE CHOSEN ON THE BASIS OF THEIR TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES AND PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUPPORTING NASA S MISSION OF EXTENDING INCLUSION TO A WIDER RANGE OF RESEARCHERS. INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS (ATA ENGINEERING  BOEING  FORT WAYNE METALS) WERE SELECTED FOR THEIR BACKGROUND IN SUPERSONIC PLATFORM AND APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS. THE OVERALL RESEARCH STRATEGY IS COMPOSED OF THREE MAJOR FOCUS AREAS OR TECHNICAL CHALLENGES THAT MUST BE MET FOR PROGRAM SUCCESS: I) DISTRIBUTED ADAPTIVITY DESIGN TOOLS DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE STUDIES  II) MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATED SOLID-STATE ACTUATION DESIGN; AND III) DETAILED DESIGN AND DEMONSTRATION. INITIALLY  THE TEAM IS IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS WHERE SMALLSCALE DISTRIBUTED ADAPTIVITY CAN PROVIDE A BENEFIT IN NOISE OR DRAG ACROSS THE ENTIRE FLIGHT ENVELOPE. FOR SELECTED APPLICATIONS/STRUCTURAL LOCATIONS  REQUIRED OML GEOMETRY CHANGES WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON ANALYSIS OF BOOM GROUND SIGNATURE AND DRAG REDUCTION USING NEW DESIGN TOOLS AND TRADE STUDIES. ADAPTIVE STRUCTURE DESIGNS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED AGAINST THE REQUIREMENTS (E.G.  LOADING  STROKE LENGTH  OPERATIONAL TEMPERATURE)  INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ALLOY FORMULATIONS TAILORED FOR BOTH AUTONOMOUS AND CONTROLLED ACTUATION.

WE WILL USE STATE-OF-THE-ART ATMOSPHERIC MODELING AND ADJOINT METHODS TO ESTIMATE BOTH ABSOLUTE IMPACTS AND SENSITIVITIES TO PARAMETERS INCLUDING FLEET SIZE  AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE AND EMISSIONS  FUEL PROPERTIES  AND ROUTE SELECTION. THE MODELS WE WILL DEVELOP IN ORDER TO ASSESS THESE IMPACTS WILL COMPRISE A SUITE OF FLEXIBLE AND POWERFUL RAPID DESIGN AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS ALLOWING FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT AS WELL AS MORE GENERAL ATMOSPHERIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES  WE HAVE GATHERED A TEAM WITH INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED EXPERTISE IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE  CLIMATE SCIENCE  AVIATION S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS  AND THE MODELS REQUIRED TO EFFICIENTLY STUDY THESE SYSTEMS. ASSESSING THE OZONE AND CLIMATE IMPACTS OF SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT REQUIRES AN INTEGRATED APPROACH THAT INVOLVES INTERACTIONS AMONG SEVERAL COMPONENT MODELS  WHICH WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED TO ASSESS AVIATION S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. FOR THIS STUDY  WE WILL IMPROVE THESE TOOLS TO REPRESENT THE EFFECTS OF SUPERSONIC  STRATOSPHERIC FLIGHT AND IMPLEMENT EFFICIENT NUMERICAL METHODS TO ASSESS MODEL SENSITIVITIES TO INPUT PARAMETERS. WE WILL USE OUR EXPERIENCE MODELING AND IMPLEMENTING STRATOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY IN THE GEOS-CHEM UCX 3D CHEMICAL-TRANSPORT MODEL TO FURTHER ADVANCE MODELING OF THE IMPACT OF AIRCRAFT FLYING IN THE STRATOSPHERE. SPECIFIC FOCUS AREAS WILL INCLUDE IMPROVING THE TREATMENT OF WATER INTRODUCED IN THE STRATOSPHERE BY HIGH-ALTITUDE AIRCRAFT AND EXTENDING HETEROGENEOUS REACTION MECHANISMS TO INCLUDE CHEMISTRY ON HYDROPHILIC CARBONACEOUS AEROSOLS. IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT INTERACTIONS OF AVIATION NOX WITH THE OZONE CYCLE  WE ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL OZONE EFFECTS DUE TO INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AVIATION EMISSIONS AND CHLORINE ACTIVATION  AND INDIRECT CLIMATE EFFECTS DUE TO OXIDATION OF ATMOSPHERIC METHANE. WE WILL IMPLEMENT AN ADJOINT MODEL OF GEOS-CHEM UCX IN ORDER TO EFFICIENTLY ASSESS A WIDE RANGE OF EMISSIONS AND ROUTE SELECTION SCENARIOS. A SINGLE ADJOINT MODEL RUN WILL PROVIDE THE SENSITIVITY COEFFICIENTS NEEDED TO COMPUTE FIRST-ORDER ESTIMATES FOR CHANGES TO MEAN OZONE CONCENTRATION  POPULATION EXPOSURE TO UV  AND GLOBAL RADIATIVE FORCING FOR ANY FLEET AND EMISSIONS SCENARIO  INCLUDING THE EVALUATION OF IMPACTS FROM INDIVIDUAL ROUTES AND THE EFFECT OF INDIVIDUAL DESIGN DECISIONS. WE WILL ALSO INCORPORATE THE CLIMATE IMPACT RESULTING FROM DIFFERENCES IN CONTRAIL FORMATION BETWEEN HIGH-ALTITUDE SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT AND CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT BY EXTENDING OUR EXISTING CONTRAIL MODEL TO STRATOSPHERIC ALTITUDES AND INTRODUCING MICROPHYSICAL MODELS FOR HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEATION OF MIXED WATER/SULFURIC ACID VAPOR AND HOMOGENEOUS NUCLEATION OF ICE CRYSTALS. SIMPLIFIED CHEMICAL KINETIC MODELS OF SUPERSONIC CRUISE AIRCRAFT ENGINES WILL BE EMPLOYED TO ESTIMATE EMISSIONS PROFILES FOR BLACK CARBON  NOX  SOX  AND OTHER SPECIES AFFECTING ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND RADIATIVE TRANSFER. THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE JET FUELS  INCLUDING LOW-SULFUR  LOW AROMATICS FUELS PRODUCED BY HEFA AND FISCHER-TROPSCH PROCESSES WILL BE MODELED BY INCORPORATING DATA FROM EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS WITH THE ENGINE MODEL. WE WILL ALSO CONSIDER SCENARIOS FOR POSSIBLE LNG-FUELED AIRCRAFT WHICH COULD OFFER SIMILAR EMISSIONS BENEFITS. THE IMPACT OF SUPERSONIC CRUISE AIRCRAFT WILL DEPEND ON THE ROUTES AND SCHEDULES OF THOSE AIRCRAFT. WE WILL IDENTIFY A SET OF PHYSICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE ROUTES BASED ON INSIGHTS FROM FLEET ASSIGNMENT MODELS  IN WHICH AIRCRAFT ARE ASSIGNED TO ROUTES SO AS TO MAXIMIZE NETWORK PROFITABILITY.

DURING TAKEOFF AND LANDING  COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT UTILIZE HIGH-LIFT SYSTEMS SUCH AS SLATS AND FLAPS TO ENSURE THAT THE WINGS PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT FOR SAFE OPERATION AT THE RELATIVELY LOW SPEEDS OF THESE PHASES OF FLIGHT. IMPROVED HIGH-LIFT PERFORMANCE AFFECTS THE TAKE-OFF FIELD LENGTH  CLIMB RATE AND LANDING APPROACH SPEED. FOR A GIVEN AIRCRAFT DESIGN  INCREASING THE LIFT IN THE HIGH-LIFT CONFIGURATION ALLOWS FOR SHORTER FIELD LENGTHS OR HIGHER PAYLOADS. INCREASING THE LIFT-TO-DRAG RATIO (BY INCREASING LIFT AND/OR DECREASING DRAG) CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCTIONS IN FUEL CONSUMPTION. ONE CONCEPT FOR INCREASING LIFT IN A HIGH-LIFT CONFIGURATION IS THE MICROJET: A SMALL  NOMINALLY-ORTHOGONAL JET LOCATED CLOSE TO THE TRAILING EDGE OF AN AIRFOIL. LIFT ENHANCEMENT HAS BEEN PREDICTED AND EXPERIMENTALLY OBSERVED FOR SINGLE ELEMENT AIRFOILS  BUT THE CONCEPT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED ON THE FLAP OF A MULTI-ELEMENT AIRFOIL. COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) SIMULATIONS INDICATE THAT A MICROJET IN THIS LOCATION COULD INCREASE LIFT AND REDUCE DRAG  WITH A RELATIVELY LOW OPERATING PRESSURE REQUIREMENT. WE PROPOSE TO DESIGN AND BUILD AN AIRFOIL MODEL FOR TESTING IN A WIND TUNNEL IN ORDER TO EXPERIMENTALLY VALIDATE THE CONCEPT OF A MICROJET ON THE FLAP OF A MULTI-ELEMENT AIRFOIL AND TO PROVIDE DATA FOR VALIDATION OF CFD MODELING. THE MODEL WILL HAVE A CONSTANT CROSS-SECTIONAL PROFILE BASED ON THE NLR 7301 AIRFOIL  WHICH CONSISTS OF A MAIN ELEMENT AND A FLAP.

NOVEL WALL-MODELING TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE EMERGED IN THE LAST DECADE HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF OVERCOMING THIS BARRIER  BY NOT RESOLVING THE TINY NEAR-WALL EDDIES DIRECTLY  BUT MODELING THEIR EFFECTS ON THE OUTER-LAYER FLOW.

ALTHOUGH LOCAL NONLINEAR SOLVERS ENJOYED EARLY SUCCESS IN CFD SOLVERS  PARTICULARLY WHEN USED AS SMOOTHERS WITHIN A NON-LINEAR MULTIGRID APPROACH  THESE HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN REPLACED BY LINEAR SOLVER TECHNIQUES USED AS DRIVERS FOR NEWTON OR QUASI-NEWTON METHODS DUE TO ROBUSTNESS ISSUES ENCOUNTERED WITH LOCAL NONLINEAR METHODS FOR MORE DEMANDING CFD PROBLEMS  INCLUDING HIGHER RESOLUTION CASES  MORE CHALLENGING FLOW PHYSICS  AND STIFFER NONLINEAR SYSTEMS RESULTING FROM EMERGING HIGH-ORDER DISCRETIZATION SCHEMES.

ON THE OTHER HAND  LOCAL NONLINEAR SOLVERS ARE GENERALLY VERY EFFECTIVE AT OVERCOMING THESE INITIAL STRONG NONLINEARITIES  BUT LACK THE RIGOROUS PROPERTIES OF CONTRACTIVITY THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED FOR LINEAR METHODS SUCH AS KRYLOV TECHNIQUES  WHICH IN TURN CAN BE USED TO DRIVE A NEWTON METHOD AT LOW RESIDUAL LEVELS  WHERE NONLINEAR EFFECTS BECOME VANISHINGLY SMALL. FURTHERMORE  THE EMERGENCE OF HETEROGENEOUS ARCHITECTURES WITH LOW MEMORY BANDWIDTH AND MASSIVE PARALLELISM WOULD SEEM TO PUT GLOBAL LINEARIZATION METHODS AT A DISADVANTAGE  DUE TO THE LARGE MEMORY REQUIREMENTS OF (APPROXIMATE) MATRIX FACTORIZATION AND POOR SCALABILITY POTENTIAL AT THE HIGH END. HOWEVER  THE USE OF LINEAR AND NONLINEAR METHODS NEED NOT BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE  AND TECHNIQUES FOR COMBINING THE ADVANTAGES OF BOTH APPROACHES OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING SUPERIOR SOLVERS THAT ARE PROVABLY ROBUST  NUMERICALLY EFFICIENT  AND HIGHLY SCALABLE. THE PRINCIPAL IDEA OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVISE STRATEGIES THAT MAKE USE OF A SPECTRUM OF BOTH LINEAR AND NONLINEAR SOLUTION TECHNIQUES AT DIFFERENT SCALES  PROVIDING AN AVENUE FOR OPTIMIZING ROBUSTNESS  EFFICIENCY AND SCALABILITY FOR VARIOUS CFD DISCRETIZATIONS ON VARIOUS TYPES OF HARDWARE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE USE OF NONLINEAR RESIDUAL SMOOTHING METHODS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH NEWTON-KRYLOV METHODS  THE APPLICATION OF NONLINEAR (FAS) MULTIGRID METHODS FOR NEWTON METHOD CONTINUATION  AND THE TAILORING OF LOCAL LINEAR SOLVERS AND/OR NONLINEAR SMOOTHERS TO BLOCK SIZES THAT ENABLE OPTIMAL USE OF EMERGING HARDWARE CONFIGURATIONS.

THE FUNDAMENTAL METHOD PROPOSED IN THE PROJECT IS LEVEL SET TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION WITH SPARSE DATE. TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION IS WELL KNOWN TO PRODUCE DESIGNS THAT DEPART SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE TRADITIONAL DESIGNS. THE LEVEL SET BASED METHOD HAS AN ADDED ADVANTAGE OF PRODUCING CLEAR BOUNDARIES WHICH IS CHALLENGING IN THE TRADITIONAL ELEMENT-BASED METHODS (E.G. SIMP). THE LEVEL SET METHOD IS THUS  PARTICULARLY SUITABLE FOR PHYSICS WHERE THE CLEAR BOUNDARIES ARE NEEDED TO DEFINE THE SURFACE PHYSICS SUCH AS CONVECTION. SMALL FEATURES ARE CONSIDERED BENEFICIAL FOR THERMAL MANAGEMENT AS HEAT TRANSFER PER UNIT AREA SCALES INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL WITH A CHARACTERISTIC DIMENSION AND THE SURFACE AREA-TO-VOLUME RATIO INCREASES WITH THE DECREASING DIMENSION  ACHIEVING ENHANCED EFFICIENCY PER UNIT VOLUME.

ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEMS OFFER SUPERIOR THERMAL EFFICIENCY COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL PROPULSION  BUT DO NOT OFFER A BUILT-IN MECHANISM TO REJECT EXCESS HEAT IN TO THE ATMOSPHERE  POTENTIALLY LEADING TO REDUCED SUBSYSTEM PERFORMANCE OR FAILURE DUE TO OVERHEATING.

THIS OBJECTIVE IS ENTIRELY IN LINE WITH NASA'S CFD VISION 2030 STUDY  ENABLING BETTER FLOW PREDICTIONS AT THE EDGE OF THE OPERATIONAL ENVELOPE AT REALISTIC FLIGHT CONDITIONS. THE PROPOSAL IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING A SYSTEMATIC  ALGORITHM-DRIVEN  ADAPTIVE APPROACH TO FINDING THE RIGHT GRID AND THE RIGHT LOCATION OF THE MODELING INTERFACE IN THE WMLES METHOD. THESE FACTORS (THE GRID AND THE MODELING INTERFACE) ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS DETERMINING THE ACCURACY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS OF A WMLES PREDICTION. THE IMPORTANCE OF GRID-ADAPTATION STEMS FROM THE OBSERVATION THAT THE GRID IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR DETERMINING THE QUALITY (ACCURACY  RELIABILITY) OF A WMLES. THIS IS TRUE FOR LES IN A GENERAL SENSE  AND ALSO MORE SPECIFICALLY FOR WMLES  SINCE THE GRID RESOLUTION NEAR THE MODELING INTERFACE IS KNOWN TO CONTROL THE MAJORITY OF THE ERROR IN WMLES. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF GRID ADAPTATION FOR LES  THE PROBLEM HAS RECEIVED VERY LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE LITERATURE. THE SECOND FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE PROBLEM OF WHERE TO PLACE THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE LES REGION AND THE WALL-MODELED REGION. THEORY CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THIS INTERFACE SHOULD BE PLACED AT 10-20% OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER THICKNESS FOR EQUILIBRIUM BOUNDARY LAYERS  BUT THIS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT SUFFICIENT IN COMPLEX FLOWS WHERE THE BOUNDARY LAYER THICKNESS IS: (A) UNKNOWN A PRIORI; (B) CHANGES DRAMATICALLY IN SPACE; AND (C) MAY NOT EVEN BE A WELL DEFINED QUANTITY (E.G.

INTERMEDIATE MODELS (E.G.  LARGE EDDY SIMULATION (LES) OR DETACHED EDDY SIMULATION (DES)) RESOLVE LARGER SCALES AND PROVIDE INTERMEDIATE ACCURACY AND COST. FOR TOO LONG  RESEARCHERS HAVE PITCHED A PARTICULAR MODEL IN THIS SPECTRUM AS THE KEY TO IMPROVED ENGINEERING PREDICTION. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO APPLY SIMULATIONS ACROSS THE ENTIRE MODELING/RESOLVING SPECTRUM TO SYSTEMATICALLY IDENTIFY MODELING SUCCESSES AND FAILURES. RATHER THAN PROMOTE A SINGLE CLASS OF MODELS  EACH LOWER FIDELITY MODEL WILL BE ASSESSED WITH THE NEXT HIGHER FIDELITY MODEL UNDER MATCHED FLOW CONDITIONS. WHILE THE IDEA OF USING STATISTICS  BUDGETS  AND A PRIORI TESTS FROM HIGHER FIDELITY MODELS TO IDENTIFY FAILURES AND IMPROVEMENTS TO LOWER FIDELITY MODELS IS NOT NEW  THE EFFORT PROPOSED HEREIN BUILDS STRONGLY ON THIS PRIOR WORK TOGETHER WITH DRAMATIC ADVANCES IN MASSIVELY PARALLEL CFD TO APPLY THIS APPROACH ACROSS AN UNPRECEDENTED RANGE OF REYNOLDS NUMBERS  SRS MODELS  COORDINATED FLOW PROBLEMS  AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. SPECIFICALLY  THIS WORK WILL STUDY AN EXTRUSION OF A BUMP PROFILE THAT MATCHES THE CENTERLINE COEFFICIENT OF PRESSURE FROM A RECENTLY STARTED JOINT COMPUTATIONAL/EXPERIMENTAL STUDY AT BOEING. BY RESOLVING THE WALL LAYER AT DNS RESOLUTION OVER MOMENTUM THICKNESS REYNOLDS NUMBERS RANGING FROM   THE TUNNEL SPEED (2130)  THE FULL TUNNEL SPEED (4260)  AND THEN UP TO 25 700 (USING DNS NEAR THE WALL AND LES AWAY FROM IT)  WALL MODELS FOR LES CAN BE TESTED IN A 12-FOLD RISE IN REYNOLDS NUMBERS IN A COMBINATION OF ZERO  FAVORABLE  AND ADVERSE PRESSURE GRADIENTS THAT OCCUR IN RAPID SUCCESSION AND RESULT IN SEPARATION. THESE CONDITIONS REPLICATE THE MOST CHALLENGING SEPARATED FLOWS ON HIGH-LIFT WING CONFIGURATIONS. USING THESE THREE DATABASES  MODELS WILL BE ASSESSED USING A PRIORI AND A POSTERIORI CLOSURE MODELING TESTS  IMPROVED  AND THEN VALIDATED ON A SERIES OF INCREASINGLY COMPLEX MODELS  INCLUDING  AT THE END  APPLICATION OF THE IMPROVED SRS MODELS TO HIGH-LIFT WING CONFIGURATIONS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NASA DUE TO ITS STRONG POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE BOTH SRS MODELS AND ULTIMATELY RANS MODELS. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IMPROVING RANS MODELING  HYBRID MODELS THAT HOLD THE GREATEST PROMISE FOR SRS METHODS WILL NOT ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7d586cfa-95f6-0e31-3589-fbd59b788eda-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80NSSC18M0147_8000"}, {"internal_id": 69948957, "Award ID": "80NSSC18M0146", "Award Amount": 599220.19, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2018-09-20", "CFDA Number": "43.002", "Description": "THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES SUBTOPIC 2.1.3 OF THE TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES (TTT) COMPONENT OF THE 2018 NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT   BENCHMARK EXPERIMENTS FOR CFD VALIDATION .

OUR RESEARCH CONTAINS TWO MAJOR PROCESSING STAGES: CONCEPT PREDICTION SYSTEM (CPS) AND ARCHITECTURAL VULNERABILITY DETECTION (AVD). THE CPS ALLOWS US TO PREDICT EMERGING SECURITY VULNERABILITIES. BY ANALYZING HACKER DISCUSSION FORUMS  TWITTER FEEDS  EMAIL LISTS  ETC. VIA TEXT MINING  MACHINE LEARNING  AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS  WE WILL PROVIDE ANALYSTS WITH A SET OF TOOLS TO HELP THEM TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE HIGH PRIORITY VULNERABILITIES THOSE MOST LIKELY TO BE EXPLOITED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  THE AVD STAGE USES THE PREDICTED EMERGING CONCEPTS TO GUIDE AN ANALYST TO POTENTIAL THREATS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE CONCEPTS  SO THAT COST-EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY COUNTER-MEASURES CAN BE DEVELOPED. AVD WILL HELP REASON ABOUT THE MITIGATION OF ATTACKS PROACTIVELY BY GUIDING AN ANALYST TO LOCATE  PRIORITIZE  AND REFACTOR AREAS OF THE SYSTEM DEEMED TO BE MOST VULNERABLE. THUS ANALYSTS WILL BE ABLE TO DIRECT THEIR EFFORTS IN AN EMPIRICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIED WAY TO PROACTIVELY FIX THE HIGHEST RISK VULNERABILITIES. ONCE AN EMERGING CONCEPT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IT NEEDS TO BE PRIORITIZED: THIS IS A DETERMINATION OF THE RISK EXPOSURE OF THIS CONCEPT. A LIST OF EMERGING CONCEPTS ANNOTATED WITH THEIR RISK EXPOSURES CAN BE PROVIDED TO ANALYSTS WHO CAN QUICKLY EVALUATE IF THEIR SYSTEMS COULD BE VULNERABLE TO THESE CONCEPTS  AND CAN ANALYZE THE FEASIBILITY OF COUNTERMEASURES.  ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO USE THE KNOWLEDGE OF A LIKELY ATTACK TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH A SPECIFIC SYSTEM MAY BE VULNERABLE TO THAT ATTACK. FOR THIS PURPOSE WE WILL EXPLORE TECHNIQUES FOR DETERMINING IF A SYSTEM IS AT RISK WITH RESPECT TO A VULNERABILITY. WE WILL ANALYZE CANDIDATE SYSTEMS USING MODEL CHECKING AND STATISTICAL MACHINE-LEARNING APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL THREATS  SO THAT COUNTER-MEASURES CAN BE PLANNED AND IMPLEMENTED.

IN ADDITION  EACH OF THOSE HIGH LEVEL GOALS ARE THEMSELVES COMPOSED OF MULTIPLE SUBGOALS. FOR EXAMPLE  OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE FOR A ROBOT MAY REQUIRE MOBILITY  ENERGY MANAGEMENT  COMMUNICATION  AND OBSERVATION TASKS WHILE  AGAIN  PROVIDING EXPLANATIONS AND ASSURANCES. THIS NEED TO MANAGE A VARIETY OF POSSIBLY IMPORTANT GOALS TURNS THE WELL-STUDIED LEARNING PROBLEM OF HOW TO DETERMINE ACTIONS TO OPTIMIZE ONE GOAL INTO THE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPLEX PROBLEM OF HOW TO DETERMINE ACTIONS TO OPTIMIZE THE RIGHT GOAL AT THE RIGHT TIME. BUT HOW DOES AN AGENT KNOW WHICH OF ITS GOALS IS IMPORTANT AT ANY TIME? THIS QUESTION IS BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART IN BOTH MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION (WHICH GENERALLY RELIES ON LINEAR COMBINATIONS OF REWARDS OR PARETO CONCEPTS [8  15]) AND MULTI-TASK LEARNING (WHICH GENERALLY RELIES ON A WELL-DEFINED PROGRESSION OF GOALS [4  3  12]). THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS ENABLE AN AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM TO NOT ONLY LEARN TO CHOOSE WHICH ACTIONS TO TAKE  BUT TO LEARN TO CHOOSE WHICH REWARDS TO SEEK TO SATISFY HIGH-LEVEL MISSION GOALS.
