ONLY 1 IN 5 ALASKA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET THE RECOMMENDED SIXTY MINUTES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EVERY DAY AND ONLY IN 1 IN TEN EAT THE RECOMMENDED DAILY SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. ONE IN TEN ALASKA CHILDREN HAS A CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION AND FAR TOO MANY HAVE POOR MENTAL HEALTH WITH ONE IN FOUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING SUICIDE.  HEALTH PROMOTING STRATEGIES AIMED AT SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN WITHIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING OBESITY AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES AND IMPROVE OVERALL HEALTH AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS.
