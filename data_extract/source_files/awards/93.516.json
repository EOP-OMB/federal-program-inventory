THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC EXPOSED THE DEEP FRACTURES AND INEQUITIES WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ALSO OFFERED UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY FOR RECRUITING AND TRAINING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ARE A PROMISING APPROACH TO IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES, PARTICULARLY WITHIN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND POPULATIONS. DESPITE THE DOCUMENTED HEALTH INEQUITIES, INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS, AND PROMISE OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO IMPROVE THESE ISSUES, THE STATE OF ALABA MA HAS NO FORMAL CHW CERTIFICATION PROGRAM AND CHW EFFORTS ARE SILOED.

THE PROJECT WILL ENGAGE 240 INDIVIDUALS IN THE NEW DUAL CERTIFICATION PROGRAM, 135 WILL RECEIVE NEW CERTIFICATIONS, 45 ENROLLED IN A REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM, AND 60 CURRENT CHWS OR CPRSS WILL RECEIVE ENHANCED SKILLS TRAINING.   ROWAN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE PROPOSES A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH COLETTE LAMOTHE-GALETTE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER INSTITUTE AND THE NEW JERSEY DIVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES TO DEVELOP A DUAL COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER (CHW) AND CERTIFIED PEER RECOVERY SPECIALIST (CPRS) APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO EXPAND THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE THAT IS ABLE TO PROVIDE BOTH RECOVERY SUPPORT AND PROVIDE ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASES IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN NEW JERSEY THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY BOTH COVID-19 AND THE OPIOID OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC. THROUGH THE PROGRAM, ROWANSOM WILL TRAIN 180 INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DUALLY CERTIFIED AS BOTH COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND CERTIFIED PEER RECOVERY SPECIALISTS AND EXTEND THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS OF 60 INDIVIDUALS WITH ONLY A CHW OR CPRS CERTIFICATION. THE GEOGRAPHIC CATCHMENT AREA FOR THE PROJECT WILL BE SIX COUNTIES IN SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY WITH THE WORST HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THE HIGHEST OVERDOSE RATES IN THE STATE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS (SUDS) ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR ONE OR MORE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AND THAT HOSPITALIZATION IS MORE PREVALENT IN PATIENTS WITH SUDS AND A CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT AN SUD. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT OVERDOSE DEATHS CONTINUE TO WORSEN FOR BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE, BUT RATES FOR OTHER RACE AND ETHNICITY GROUPS HELD STEADY OR DECREASED. DURING THE PANDEMIC, O VERDOSE DEATH RATES PER 100,000 BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS INCREASED FROM 24.7 IN 2019 TO 36.8 IN 2020, WHICH WAS 16.3% HIGHER THAN THAT FOR WHITE INDIVIDUALS (31.6) IN 2020. OTHER STUDIES SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WITH SUDS HAD AN INCREASED RISK FOR COVID-19 AND EXPERIENCED WORSE OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, DESPITE HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SUDS AND INCREASED RISK FOR RELAPSE TO OPIATES AND OTHER DRUGS WHEN PATIENTS DEVELOP A CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROFESSION HAS REMAINED SEGREGATED FROM THE SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT FIELD. THIS SEGREGATION MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH INEQUITIES IN THE SUBSTANCE USE POPULATION AND EXACERBATING THE OPIATE OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC. THIS PROJECT WILL EXPLORE THE CREATION OF A NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER-CERTIFIED PEER RECOVERY SPECIALIST TRAINING PROGRAM THAT WILL PREPARE A WORKFORCE TO ADDRESS BOTH CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AND PROVIDE PEER RECOVERY SUPPORT THROUGH LIVED EXPERIENCE. THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO 1) EXPAND THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE TO INCLUDE THE NEW DUAL CERTIFICATION IN CHW-CPRS, 2) PROVIDE ENHANCED SKILL TRAINING TO CURRENT CHWS AND CPRSS, 3) INCREASE EMPLOYMENT READINESS THROUGH PLACEMENT IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND EXPERIENTIAL TRAINING, AND 4) ENHANCE HEALTH EQUITY IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY BY BUILDING AWARENESS OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDING JOB PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE.

IN BALTIMORE CITY IN PARTICULAR, TO HIGHLIGHT SUCH A DISPARITY, SIMPLY LIVING IN SOME OF THE POOREST REGIONS (AS IDENTIFIED BY THEIR CENSUS TRACT) RESULTS IN A LIFE EXPECTANCY UP TO 20-YEARS LESS THEN MORE AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOODS. AND IN THOSE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS, THERE IS A HIGH PREVALENCE OF MORBIDITIES THAT ARE LINKED WITH DIRE HEALTH OUTCOMES, FROM DIABETES TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, IN ADDITION TO OPIOID USE AND HOMICIDES. AND WITH THE BALTIMORE CITY NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PROFILE REPORTING ON THESE OUTCOMES OVER 10 YEARS (FROM 2008 TO 2017), THE DISPARITIES IN LIFE-EXPECTANCY HAVE NOT BEEN REDUCED. OVERALL, BALTIMORE CITY HAS THE HIGHEST VULNERABILITY RATINGS OF ANY REGION IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF NEIGHBORHOOD DISADVANTAGE MAY RESULT IN AN IMPROVED INSIGHT INTO THE SOCIAL CONTEXT AND SOCIOBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT IMPACT HEALTH DISPARITIES, WHICH IN TURN MAY FACILITATE MORE IMPROVED AND EQUITABLE INTERVENTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY IN THE IMMEDIATE SENSE AS WELL AS FOSTERING PUBLIC POLICY FOR LONG-TERM CHANGES.

THE CHW ACADEMY WILL EXPAND AND DIVERSIFY THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE BY ENGAGING CHWS IN INNOVATIVE, EVIDENCE-BASED WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WITHIN 3 BROAD IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES (EXPANSION, EXTENSION/UPSKILLING, EMPLOYMENT). THIS WILL ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES, INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY RESPONSE WITHIN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN THE WASHINGTON, DC METROPOLITAN REGION. EACH SET OF STRATEGIES WILL SEEK TO INCREASE EQUITY; DRAW UPON THE STRENGTHS AND LIVED EXPERIENCES FROM THOSE WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED; LEVERAGE PARTNERSHIPS TO SUSTAINABLE CHW CAREER PATHS; USE EVIDENCE-BASED AND PROMISING PRACTICES (E.G., APPRENTICESHIPS, FIELD-PLACEMENTS, MENTORING, EMPLOYER COACHING, LEARNING COLLABORATIVES, ECHO (EXTENSION FOR COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES) MODEL; SUSTAINABLE FINANCING EXPLORATION); AND EXPAND THE POOL OF ACCREDITED CHWS. COMBINED, THIS WILL ALLOW THE CHW ACADEMY TO SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:  GOAL 1: EXPAND THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE THROUGH NEW & EXISTING CHWS GOAL 2: EXTEND & UPSKILL THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE THROUGH NEW & ENHANCED CURRICULUMS TO INCREASE SKILLS & COMPETENCIES GOAL 3: INCREASE CHW EMPLOYMENT READINESS THROUGH FIELD PLACEMENTS & APPRENTICESHIPS GOAL 4: INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYED CHWS TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY IN FOCUS COMMUNITIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": 3000000.0, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "283790f8-4c20-6056-6453-1b1510a41ce8-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_T2946698_7526"}, {"internal_id": 151948123, "Award ID": "T2946697", "Award Amount": 2999856.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-07", "CFDA Number": "93.516", "Description": "COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER TRAINING PROGRAM - THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION (IPHA), IN COLLABORATION WITH A ROBUST NETWORK OF PARTNERS, PROPOSES TO ESTABLISH THE ILLINOIS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER HELPGUIDETHRIVE PROGRAM.

LEVERAGING LONG-TIME PARTNERSHIPS WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CLASSES AND APPRENTICESHIPS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS PROJECT.  EFFECTIVELY REMEDIATING HEALTH DISPARITIES REQUIRES COMMUNITY-WIDE EFFORTS TO REDUCE DISCRIMINATION, INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH RESOURCES, INCREASE EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND IMPROVE LIVING ENVIRONMENTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ACROSS THE STATE, DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT CULTURAL VALUES, THUS THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL CHW TRAINEES TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. CONNECTING SOCIALLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO CONTINUUMS OF CARE WILL IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES.  DISSEMINATING MCHC'S PRACTICES AROUND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE WORKFORCE WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE WORK PLAN FOR THIS PROJECT. IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO BUILD CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE. HOW TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF CHWS WILL BE SHARED VIA MCHC'S RESOURCE GUIDE FOR DEVELOPING OTHER CENTER'S CHW TRAINING AND PLACEMENT PROGRAM.

(DRP) IS SEEKING $1,000,000 PER YEAR FOR THREE YEARS TO EXPAND ITS PARAPROFESSIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM, CURRENTLY OFFERED THROUGH THE RECOVERY TRAINING INSTITUTE (RTI). THE EXPANSION OF RTI WILL INCLUDE A NEW EDUCATIONAL TRACK OPTION FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHW) IN THE METROPOLITAN DETROIT AREA. THE POPULATION IN DETROIT IS PREDOMINANTLY BLACK AND HAS HIGHER HEALTH-RELATED RISK FACTORS THAN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY COVID-19, AS WELL AS THE MULTIPLE AND COMPLEX BARRIERS RESIDENTS FACE IN ACCESSING HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES. TO RESPOND TO THESE CHALLENGES, DRP WILL IMPLEMENT A CHW TRAINING PROGRAM TO FILL THE GAPS IN SERVICE AND LINK THOSE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO CARE IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN.   THE CHW TRAINING IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH THAT USES COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH PROMOTION AND PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION AND EMPOWERMENT TO ADDRESS HEALTH ISSUES AND TO IMPACT KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND BEHAVIORS FROM WITHIN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON THE METROPOLITAN DETROIT AREA, WHERE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES COMMONLY LACK ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY. INDIVIDUALS FROM THESE TARGETED COMMUNITIES WILL BE TRAINED AS CHWS TO CONDUCT OUTREACH, CONNECT INDIVIDUALS TO HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES, AND PROVIDE HEALTH EDUCATION.  THE PROGRAM GOALS ARE TO EXPAND THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE BY TRAINING 50 PARTICIPANTS ANNUALLY TO BECOME NEWLY CREDENTIALED CHWS, TOTALING 150 CHWS OVER THE THREE-YEAR GRANT PERIOD; ENHANCE THE CHW CURRICULUM TO INCREASE THE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES OF EXISTING CHWS AND HEALTH WORKERS; INCREASE CHW AND HEALTH SUPPORT WORKER EMPLOYMENT READINESS THROUGH FIELD PLACEMENTS AND APPRENTICESHIPS; ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY AND SUPPORT FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BY INCREASING  THE NUMBER OF CHWS. OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, DRP\u2019S RTI HAS BEEN THE LEADER THROUGHOUT METROPOLITAN DETROIT FOR PROVIDING EVIDENCE-BASED PARAPROFESSIONAL TRAININGS TO OVER 400 INDIVIDUALS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BECOME CERTIFIED PEER RECOVERY COACHES. DRP\u2019S RTI IS A NATIONALLY REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM, WHICH ADDS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE NEW CHW TRAINING PROGRAM. THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED TO ENSURE THE GOALS ARE ACCOMPLISHED.   OBJECTIVE 1: DEVELOP (5) CULTURALLY RELEVANT COURSES THAT ARE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE, TECHNOLOGY BASED AND ADDRESS THE CORE COMPETENCIES FOR CHWS IN OBTAINING THEIR STATE CERTIFICATION.   OBJECTIVE 2: PROVIDE 126+ HOURS OF COMPREHENSIVE STATE APPROVED DIDACTIC AND INTERACTIVE CLASSROOM-BASED COURSEWORK TRAINING TO EACH OF THE 50 INDIVIDUALS SERVED ANNUALLY.   OBJECTIVE 3: PROVIDE THE REQUIRED 40-HOUR PRACTICAL TRAINING EXPERIENCE TO 50 TRAINEES ANNUALLY THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF THE RECOVERY TRAINING INSTITUTE CHW TRAINING.   OBJECTIVE 4: PROVIDE 20+ HOURS OF EVIDENCE-BASED CONTINUING EDUCATION TO 10 CURRENT CHWS ANNUALLY.   OBJECTIVE 5: TRAIN 13 CHWS ANNUALLY THROUGH THE DOL REGISTERED CHW APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM.   OBJECTIVE 6: PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR 50 TRAINEES ANNUALLY.   OBJECTIVE 6: IDENTIFY AT MINIMUM 5 INTERNSHIP SITES TO SERVE AS PARTNERS PROVIDING THE REQUIRED 40-HOUR INTERNSHIP FOR UP TO 111 INDIVIDUALS OVER THE FULL DURATION OF THE GRANT.   OBJECTIVE 7: EVALUATE THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF 150 STUDENTS IN THE CHW TRAINING PROGRAM, WHO ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE TARGET COMMUNITY.   DRP IS ALSO REQUESTING FUNDING PREFERENCE.
