WHILE CONSISTENTLY PROVEN SAFE AND EFFECTIVE, NATIONAL ABCDEF BUNDLE PERFORMANCE REMAINS UNACCEPTABLY LOW AS CLINICIANS CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO BUNDLE DELIVERY. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO DEVELOP PRAGMATIC AND SUSTAINABLE STRATEGIES TO INCREASE THE DELIVERY OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES THAT LEAD TO IMPROVED CARE FOR CRITICALLY ILL ADULTS ACROSS A VARIETY OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY THOSE SERVING POPULATIONS WITH KNOWN HEALTH DISPARITIES (SAFETY NET HOSPITALS). OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO EVALUATE TWO STRATEGIES GROUNDED IN BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIC THEORY AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE TO INCREASE ABCDEF BUNDLE ADOPTION. THE STRATEGIES BEING EVALUATED TARGET A VARIETY OF ICU TEAM MEMBERS AND KNOWN BEHAVIORAL DETERMINANTS OF BUNDLE PERFORMANCE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT INCLUDES TWO PHASES AND FOUR AIMS.

OLDER ADULTS LIVING IN RURAL AREAS EXPERIENCE WORSE CVD OUTCOMES THAN THEIR URBAN COUNTERPARTS, AND MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO EACH OF THESE SPILLOVER EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY IF THEY ALSO LIVE IN POVERTY OR ARE MEMBERS OF RACIAL OR ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS. RURAL OLDER ADULTS MAY ALSO HAVE LESS ACCESS TO POTENTIAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES, SUCH AS INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT TELEHEALTH, RESTARTING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES UNDER NEW PRECAUTIONS, AND REACHING OUT TO PATIENTS PROACTIVELY TO MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASE.

THESE RESEARCHERS SUBSEQUENTLY ASSERT THE NEED TO CONSIDER THE INTERSECTIONALITY OF THESE MULTIPLE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION IN WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH RESEARCH. INTERSECTING FORMS OF SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE AND MARGINALIZATION ARE FREQUENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. NURSES, WHO HAVE LONG BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH INITIATIVES, ARE IN AN IDEAL POSITION TO PARTICIPATE IN AND LEAD TEAMS OF RESEARCHERS, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, POLICYMAKERS, AND THE LAY PUBLIC IN A CONTEMPORARY COMMITMENT TO STRENGTHEN WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH. HOWEVER, LACK OF SIGNIFICANT TRAINING IN DATA SCIENCE (DS) AND EMERGING HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES (HIT) REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NURSING SCIENTISTS IN WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH RESEARCH. THE USE OF DS AND HIT CAN IMPROVE RESEARCH EFFECTIVENESS IN REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG DISADVANTAGED GROUPS OF WOMEN BY PROVIDING VARIOUS STRATEGIES THAT WERE NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT THESE METHODOLOGIES (E.G., INCREASING ACCESS TO HIDDEN POPULATIONS, IMPROVING THE PRECISION OF MEASUREMENTS). THE PURPOSE OF THIS T32 PROGRAM IS TO PREPARE NURSE SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO EMPLOY DS AND/OR HIT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH WHILE CONSIDERING THE INTERSECTIONALITY OF MULTIPLE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERARCHING GOALS OF HEALTHY PEOPLE 2030, THE NINR STRATEGIC PLAN (ESPECIALLY RESEARCH LENSES ON HEALTH DISPARITIES AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH), THE TRANS-NIH STRATEGIC PLAN FOR WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH RESEARCH, THE IOM REPORT ON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH RESEARCH, AND THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF NURSING\u2019S WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH RESEARCH AGENDA.

THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW US TO WORK TOWARD A FUTURE IN WHICH HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE ELIMINATED ON THE FORT BELKNAP RESERVATION. THE OVERALL GOALS OF THE NARCH XI PROPOSAL ARE THREEFOLD: (1) TRAIN AANIIIH AND NAKODA NARCH SCHOLARS TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES AND PROMOTE WELLNESS THROUGH ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES, PUBLIC HEALTH AND RESEARCH TRAINING, AND RESEARCH FIELD EXPERIENCES; (2) BUILD RESEARCH CAPACITY THROUGH TWO COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PROJECTS TO ADDRESS PRIORITY HEALTH CONCERNS; AND (3) BUILD FACTORS WHICH PROMOTE RESILIENCY ACROSS ALL NARCH TRAININGS AND INTERVENTIONS. WE WILL ADDRESS THESE AIMS THROUGH THREE PROJECTS: (1) THE AANIIIH AND NAKODA STUDENT, TRIBAL HEALTH LEADER, FACULTY, AND NURSE TRAINING PROGRAM, WHICH WILL ADVANCE RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER CAPACITY WHILE DEVELOPING A PATHWAY FOR SUCCESS OF FUTURE AANIIIH AND NAKODA NURSES, RESEARCHERS, AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AT FORT BELKNAP; (2) IMPROVING SUICIDE AND SUICIDE CLUSTER PREVENTION IN HIGH-RISK REMOTE RESERVATION SETTINGS RESEARCH PROJECT; AND (3) ADAPT AND EVALUATE AN EVIDENCE- AND TECHNOLOGY-BASED SAFETY PLANNING INTERVENTION, MYPLAN APP, TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF NATIVE AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS IN RURAL SETTINGS RESEARCH PROJECT. THE RESEARCH PROJECTS WILL PROVIDE APPLIED TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR AANIIIH AND NAKODA NARCH SCHOLARS FROM HIGH SCHOOL, TO GRADUATE, AND TO TRIBAL HEALTH LEADERS. THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COLLABORATION AND LEARNING ACROSS PROJECTS, WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING RESEARCH AND TRAINING CAPACITY, UNDERSTANDING RISKS AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS AGAINST SUICIDE, AND HELPING OUR YOUTH ESTABLISH SAFE, HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. THESE RESEARCH PROJECTS WERE DETERMINED BASED ON FORT BELKNAP TRIBAL COUNCIL PRIORITIES AND THROUGH THE INPUT OF COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS. TWO TRIBAL ADVISORY BOARDS (TAB) WILL GUIDE AND OVERSEE ALL PROJECTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROJECTS.

DECADES OF RESEARCH HAVE FAILED TO AMELIORATE THIS CRISIS. MOST RESEARCH INVOLVING BLACK MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IS STRUCTURED ACCORDING TO A DEFICIT-FOCUSED FRAMEWORK, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE DEFICIENCIES AND INSUFFICIENCIES OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE EXAMINED COMMUNITY. CLINICAL PRACTICES RESULTING FROM SUCH RESEARCH NORMALIZE AND BLAME INDIVIDUALS FOR THE MATERNAL HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT BLACK WOMEN EXPERIENCE. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AND THE IMPACT OF DEFICIT-FOCUSED HEALTH CARE MODELS ON MATERNAL HEALTH BY LEVERAGING THE PROTECTIVE ASSETS OF BLACK COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS, USE OF INTEGRATED SUPPORTIVE CARE, AND A WELLNESS-BASED MOBILE TECHNOLOGY INTERVENTION TO REDUCE MATERNAL MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, AND CESAREAN BIRTH AND IMPROVE WELLNESS-RELATED BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES. OUR GOAL IS TO OFFER PRAGMATIC, COMMUNITY-CENTERED SOLUTIONS TO MATERNAL HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT BUILD UPON THE INHERENT STRENGTHS OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS AND BLACK COMMUNITIES . BASED ON OUR THEORY OF MATERNAL ADAPTIVE CAPACITY AND BUILDING UPON OUR PREVIOUS WORK, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NOVEL PROGRAM CALLED PROTECTIVE ASSETS REINFORCED WITH INTEGRATED CARE AND TECHNOLOGY (PARITY). WE PROPOSE A RANDOMIZED TRIAL AND MIXED METHODS EVALUATION INVOLVING 384 BLACK PREGNANT WOMEN, DIVIDED BETWEEN PARITY PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AND INFORMATION CONTROL (IC). OUR INNOVATIVE, COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTION WILL IDENTIFY THE STRENGTHS AND PROTECTIVE ASSETS OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS AND OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. WITHIN THE COMMUNITY SETTING, PARITY PARTICIPANTS ARE MATCHED WITH BLACK DOULAS WHO WILL PROVIDE STRENGTHS-BASED GUIDANCE, SUPPORT, AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE PREGNANCY CONTINUUM. PARITY PARTICIPANTS WILL ALSO USE A NOVEL HIPAA COMPLIANT MOBILE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT PROMOTES WELLNESS BEHAVIORS, EMPOWERED STRENGTHS, AND HEALTHCARE ADHERENCE WHILE OFFERING ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO CONNECT WITH THE COMMUNITY-BASED DOULA. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE: (1) DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF THE PARITY PROGRAM, AS COMPARED TO IC, ON SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME), MATERNAL MORTALITY, AND CESAREAN BIRTH (SECONDARY OUTCOMES) IN BLACK PREGNANT WOMEN; (2) DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF THE PARITY PROGRAM ON WELLNESS-RELATED BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES INCLUDING NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, SLEEP, AND HEALTHCARE ADHERENCE; (3) ASSESS WHETHER CHANGES IN MATERNAL OUTCOMES ARE MEDIATED BY CHANGES IN WELLNESS-RELATED BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES AND WHETHER THE EFFECTS OF PARITY ON THE WELLNESS-RELATED BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES ARE MEDIATED BY CHANGES IN EMPOWERED STRENGTHS; AND (4) IDENTIFY BARRIERS, FACILITATORS, AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF THE PARITY INTERVENTION.

A REVIEW OF RECENT HOSPITAL TO NH TRANSFERS FOUND THAT NEARLY 40% OF RESIDENTS EXPERIENCED AN ADVERSE EVENT WITHIN 45 DAYS OF DISCHARGE. NH STAFF RELY ON INFORMATION COLLECTED IN THESE ACUTE CARE SETTINGS TO SAFELY ADMIT AND INITIATE CARE FOR PATIENTS. HOWEVER, UNFORTUNATELY THE TRANSITION PROCESS IS PLAGUED BY POOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE. DISCHARGE PAPERWORK OFTEN LACKS KEY INFORMATION SUCH AS IMAGING STUDY RESULTS OR ANTIBIOTIC STOP DATES, INCLUDES OUT OF DATE INFORMATION AND IS NOT ORGANIZED TO SUPPORT DECISION MAKING IN THE NH. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION THAT PROVIDES KEY INFORMATION TO NH PROVIDERS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION. PROBARI, AN INDIANA-BASED SMALL BUSINESS DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF NH CARE THROUGH SUPPORTIVE CLINICAL SOLUTIONS, AND ITS PARTNERS AT INDIANA UNIVERSITY\u2019S REGENSTRIEF INSTITUTE, ARE DEVELOPING COEUS, A NH-FACING TRANSFER APPLICATION TO FILL THIS SIGNIFICANT GAP IN THE MARKET.

THIS LOW UTILIZATION RATE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF REGISTERED DIETITIAN NUTRITIONISTS (RDNS) COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH T2D, LIMITED REIMBURSEMENT PATHWAYS FOR MNT, AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS IN THE PATIENT POPULATION. THESE ISSUES ARE EXACERBATED IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY DUE TO LIMITED ACCESS TO CARE, ECONOMIC DISPARITIES, AND FEW RESOURCES TAILORED TO CULTURE IDENTITY. CURRENTLY, INCORPORATING CULTURAL RELEVANCE INTO AN MNT PLAN MUST BE DONE MANUALLY BY AN RDN. EXISTING DIGITAL APPLICATIONS FOCUS ON MEAL TRACKING OR DISCRETE BIOLOGICAL FACTORS (E.G.

SATISFACTION - PROJECT SUMMARY APPROXIMATELY 4% OF PEOPLE IN THE US ARE EITHER DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING, EQUATING TO MORE THAN 13 MILLION PEOPLE. OF THESE, APPROXIMATELY 12 MILLION PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 5 YEARS HAVE DIFFICULTY HEARING NORMAL CONVERSATION EVEN WHEN USING A HEARING AID. HEARING DIFFICULTIES AFFECT ALL AGE GROUPS AND PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN DAILY LIFE. THESE CHALLENGES ARE PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN HEALTHCARE SETTINGS, WHERE MISCOMMUNICATION RESULTS IN SUBOPTIMAL TREATMENT AND CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS AND POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. ERRORS IN INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION ARE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN MEDICAL ERRORS, AND THE WEARING OF SURGICAL MASKS BY HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL AND PATIENTS INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF MISCOMMUNICATION. THE SURGICAL MASK IS AN ESSENTIAL ITEM OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, PREVENTING THE TRANSMISSION OF INFECTIOUS AGENTS SUCH AS BACTERIA AND VIRUSES, BUT CONVENTIONAL SURGICAL MASKS CAN MUFFLE SPEECH AND PREVENT PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS WITH HEARING DIFFICULTIES FROM BEING ABLE TO LIP READ. LIP READING IS AN IMPORTANT VISUAL AID TO COMMUNICATION FOR EVERYONE BUT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING. OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRANSPARENT SURGICAL N95 RESPIRATOR MASK THAT PREVENTS INFECTIOUS DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND IMPROVES COMMUNICATION AMONG HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL AND PATIENTS WITH HEARING IMPAIRMENT. IN PHASE I, WE SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND TESTED A PROTOTYPE SURGICAL N95 RESPIRATOR MASK WITH A TRANSPARENT WINDOW THAT ENABLES PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO SEE EACH OTHER\u2019S LIPS WHILE MAINTAINING THE PROTECTIVE BARRIER FUNCTION OF THE MASK. A COLLABORATIVE STUDY WITH DR. SAM ATCHERSON OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AUDIOLOGY AND SPEECH PATHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT LITTLE ROCK VALIDATED THE MASK AS A VISUAL AID, SHOWING THAT GROUPS WITH EITHER MODERATE OR SEVERE-TO-PROFOUND HEARING LOSS BENEFITTED FROM THE VISUAL INPUT FROM THE PROTOTYPE MASK. THE PATENTED FACEVIEW MASK\u2122 COMBINES THE TRANSPARENT WINDOW WITH BOTH N95 FILTRATION CAPABILITY AND A UNIQUE ANTIMICROBIAL COATING TO KILL BACTERIA. IN PHASE II, WE PROPOSE TO OPTIMIZE THE MASK DESIGN, ESTABLISH A SCALABLE PRODUCTION PROCESS, AND CONDUCT FURTHER TESTING TO SUPPORT 510(K) CLEARANCE, NIOSH APPROVAL, AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE FACEVIEW MASK\u2122 SURGICAL N95 RESPIRATOR. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL 1) OPTIMIZE THE FACEVIEW MASK\u2122 AND CONDUCT A SURVEY STUDY WITH END USERS TO ENSURE COMFORT AND AN EFFECTIVE SEAL AROUND THE AIRWAYS; 2) CONDUCT COMPARATIVE PRODUCT TESTING WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, INCLUDING AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS TO GATHER THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THE FACEVIEW MASK\u2122 VS. A LEADING OPAQUE SURGICAL N95 RESPIRATOR MASK; 3) PERFORM TESTING REQUIRED FOR 510(K) CLEARANCE AND NIOSH APPROVAL OF THE FACEVIEW MASK\u2122; AND 4) TEST ITS ANTIMICROBIAL PERFORMANCE BOTH IN A STANDARD LABORATORY TEST AND IN USE BY HEALTHCARE WORKERS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "25f8a824-8274-f5f4-6de9-df154c56be1f-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R42NR017124_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49815164, "Award ID": "R42NR014087", "Award Amount": 1100747.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2015-09-23", "CFDA Number": "93.361", "Description": "IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS WITH THE DIGITAL EZ BOARD", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3488d6a8-5b3e-abd8-1147-b85934ed1985-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R42NR014087_7529"}, {"internal_id": 158528622, "Award ID": "R41NR020667", "Award Amount": 221912.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-04-25", "CFDA Number": "93.361", "Description": "AUTOMATING ASSESSMENT OF CONTEXTUALIZATION OF CARE DURING THE CLINICAL ENCOUNTER - BACKGROUND: LARGE SCALE STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT WHEN PATIENTS STRUGGLE WITH LIFE CHALLENGES THAT COMPLICATE THEIR CARE (E.G., A LACK OF SOCIAL SUPPORT, COMPETING RESPONSIBILITIES, OR FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS), HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS CAN IMPROVE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES AND LOWER COSTS IF THEY ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THESE \u201cCONTEXTUAL FACTORS\u201d AND ADDRESS THEM IN THEIR CARE PLAN \u2013 A PROCESS TERMED \u201cCONTEXTUALIZING CARE.\u201d THESE STUDIES UTILIZE A METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS CALLED \u201cCONTENT CODING FOR CONTEXTUALIZATION OF CARE\u201d (4C). 4C IS A LABOR-INTENSIVE PROCESS THAT REQUIRES HUMAN CODERS LISTEN TO AUDIO RECORDINGS FROM A SAMPLE OF MEDICAL ENCOUNTERS, EXTRACT DATA FROM EACH PATIENT\u2019S MEDICAL RECORD, AND THEN TRACK WHETHER IDENTIFIED CONTEXTUAL FACTORS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. IT HAS ENORMOUS SOCIAL VALUE AND COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL BECAUSE IT ACCURATELY IDENTIFIES CARE PLANS THAT MITIGATE SOCIAL NEEDS AND AVOID UNNECESSARY CARE. TO DATE, SHARING 4C DATA WITH HEALTH SYSTEMS HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN CARE AND A REDUCTION IN RATES OF HOSPITALIZATION. THE MANUAL 4C CODING PROCESS, HOWEVER, IS TIME CONSUMING AND UNSCALABLE. THE AUTOMATION OF 4C CODING UTILIZING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) WOULD ENABLE RAPID SCALING.

METHOD: WE PROPOSE AN ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION PROCESS, LEVERAGING AN EXISTING DATASET OF OVER 400 MANUALLY 4C CODED TRANSCRIPTS FROM PHYSICIAN-PATIENT MEDICAL ENCOUNTERS. STARTING WITH 300 TRANSCRIPTS PREVIOUSLY CODED BY OUR TEAM AND CODING GUIDELINES FROM THE 4C TRAINING MANUAL, WE WILL FIRST DEVELOP AUTOMATED TECHNIQUES FOR EXTRACTING TEXT FEATURES REFLECTIVE OF NUANCES IN LINGUISTIC CONTENT AND DISCOURSE STRUCTURE THAT DISENTANGLE CONTEXTUALIZED CARE FROM CONTEXTUAL ERROR, IN TURN FACILITATING DEVELOPMENT OF CANDIDATE CLASSIFICATION MODELS THAT EMULATE HUMAN 4C CODING DECISIONS.

WE WILL COMBINE THESE DATA WITH SIMILAR DATA FROM ANOTHER COHORT OF ~60 NEONATES (TOTAL ~ 120 NEONATES) COLLECTED USING THE SAME SYSTEM AND APPROACH AT TGH FROM 2019 TO 2022. 2) SHOW PROOF-OF-CONCEPT FOR PREDICTING THE ONSET OF POST-SURGICAL PAIN IN NEONATES. THE MULTIMODAL DATA COLLECTED FROM THE TRAINING CASES IN AIM 1 WILL PROVIDE THE GROUND TRUTH FOR TRAINING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK TO PREDICT TIME-TO-ONSET OF PAIN FOR POSTOPERATIVE NEONATES IN THE TESTING CASES. THE PERFORMANCE TARGET FOR THE EPD IN THE TEST CASES IS PAIN PREDICTION ~ 30 MINUTES PRIOR TO PAIN ONSET WITH A 90% CONFIDENCE PROBABILITY. OUR INTENTION IS TO DISRUPT THE CURRENT STANDARD [SURGERY; SEDATION; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; OPIOID DEPENDENCE, TOLERANCE, WITHDRAWAL; DISCHARGE] IN FAVOR OF A SAFER OPIOID-SPARING APPROACH [SURGERY; SEDATION; NON-OPIOID TREATMENT; DISCHARGE]. OUR PHASE 2 STUDIES WILL ADD DATA FROM MORE DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATIONS AND EXAMINE THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF EPD ON STRESS BIOMARKERS, E.G., CORTISOL, NOREPINEPHRINE IN HAIR, SKIN, BLOOD, OR URINE.

RECENTLY, APPROVAL OF ORAL VENETOCLAX (VEN) IN ADDITION TO INFUSIONAL HYPOMETHYLATING AGENTS (HMAS) HAS IMPROVED TREATMENT EFFICACY SUBSTANTIALLY FOR OLDER ADULTS, AND PROTOCOLS NOW TYPICALLY ARE TO RECEIVE THE FIRST CYCLE OF TREATMENT DURING 7 DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEN RETURN HOME FOR 21 DAYS OF TREATMENT WITH CAREGIVERS MORE ACTIVELY INVOLVED. PATIENTS ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR FATIGUE, WHICH LEADS TO FUNCTIONAL DECLINE AND SUBSEQUENT DETERIORATION IN QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), INTERFERING WITH THEIR RETURN TO INDEPENDENT LIVING. WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS SYMPTOMS AND FUNCTION MANAGEMENT EARLY IN AML TREATMENT USING A PALLIATIVE AND COLLABORATIVE CARE INTERVENTION (PACT) DELIVERED BY CLINICAL STAFF WHO RECEIVE BASIC TRAINING IN PALLIATIVE AND SUPPORTIVE CARE TO BRIDGE THIS GAP IN CARE AND ADDRESS QOL.

WHILE LAIS ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR DAILY PILL-TAKING AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HELP CLOSE CRITICAL GAPS IN HIV CARE, PATIENTS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT FREQUENT CLINIC VISITS CAN EXACERBATE STIGMA, INCREASE THE RISK OF UNWANTED DISCLOSURE, AND LEAD TO FREQUENT DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. THE NEED TO TRAVEL TO A CLINIC FOR INJECTION VISITS MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR CAN ALSO BE FINANCIALLY AND LOGISTICALLY PROHIBITIVE FOR MANY PATIENTS AND CAN WIDEN EXISTING HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES.

WHILE THERE ARE DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR MULTIPLE POPULATIONS, BLACK COMMUNITIES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES. MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RATES FOR THE BLACK POPULATION ARE 2-4 TIMES HIGHER THAN THOSE OF THE NON-HISPANIC WHITE POPULATION. THESE DISPARITIES ARE EVEN GREATER IN SOME COMMUNITIES, LIKE NEW YORK CITY, WHERE PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MORTALITY AMONG NON-HISPANIC BLACK WOMEN REMAINS 8 TIMES HIGHER THAN AMONG NON-HISPANIC WHITE WOMEN. SIMILARLY, SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY OCCURS 2- 2.5 TIMES AS FREQUENTLY AMONG NON-HISPANIC BLACK WOMEN COMPARED TO NON-HISPANIC WHITE WOMEN. IN ADDITION TO HAVING HIGHER RATES OF MEDICAL AND OBSTETRIC CO-MORBIDITIES, MORTALITY, PRETERM BIRTH, AND INFANT DEATH, BLACK WOMEN AND BIRTHING PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE OBSTETRIC RACISM MANIFESTING AS DISMISSIVENESS, DISRESPECT, LOSS OF AUTONOMY, AND ABUSE WHILE SEEKING CARE DURING PREGNANCY, LABOR, AND BIRTH.

THIS AWARD PROVIDES THE NECESSARY SUPPORT TO CONDUCT A VIRTUAL FCR TRIAL TO (1) DETERMINE EFFICACY OF THE VIRTUAL FCR INTERVENTION AND (2) UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPACT OF THE INTERVENTION. OUR RESEARCH TEAM HAS EXPERTISE ENCOMPASSING TELEHEALTH IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION, CLINICAL TRIALS, STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, MIXED METHODS, NEONATOLOGY, AND ADVANCED STATISTICAL ANALYSES. THE FOCUS OF THIS PROJECT IS THE STUDY OF FCR IN THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (NICU). FCR IS RECOGNIZED AS A BEST PRACTICE FOR HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN. BENEFITS OF FCR INCLUDE FEWER HARMFUL ERRORS, IMPROVED FAMILY EXPERIENCE, REDUCED PARENTAL ANXIETY, AND SHORTENED HOSPITAL STAYS. HOWEVER, FCR IS INFREQUENTLY CONDUCTED IN THE NICU, BECAUSE IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN PARENTS CAN BE AT THE BEDSIDE DURING THE ROUNDING PROCESS. IMPORTANTLY, THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PREVENT PARENTS FORM BEING PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THE NICU (E.G., FINANCIAL, WORK, TRAVEL, AND CHILDCARE CONSTRAINTS) DISPROPORTIONATELY HINDER UNDERSERVED FAMILIES, PARTICULARLY RURAL AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES. TELEHEALTH USE TO CONDUCT VIRTUAL FCR HAS POTENTIAL TO MITIGATE THESE PROBLEMS. TELEHEALTH TRANSFORMS THE ROUNDING PARADIGM BY VIRTUALLY BRINGING THE PARENTS TO THE NEONATE\u2019S BEDSIDE, ENSUING MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO RECONCILE MISINFORMATION AND MORE COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT IMPROVE INFORMATION SHARING, SHARED DECISION-MAKING, AND TRUST. ALTHOUGH OUR TEAM HAS PILOT TESTED VIRTUAL FCR, OUR PILOT TRIAL WAS NOT POWERED FOR HYPOTHESIS TESTING. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROPOSED TRIAL INCLUDES ADDITIONAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES.

SADLY, THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR A PERSON LIVING WITH MFWS IS SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS. MALODOR IS THE MOST DISTRESSING AND DEBILITATING SYMPTOM OF MFWS, CAUSING GAGGING, VOMITING, LOSS OF APPETITE, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, INCLUDING SOCIAL WITHDRAWAL, SOCIAL ISOLATION, ANXIETY, LONELINESS, AND DEPRESSION. MALODOR RESULTS FROM A COCKTAIL OF VOLATILE AGENTS THAT INCLUDES ACIDS, POLYAMINES, AND SULFUR COMPOUNDS SUCH AS DIMETHYL TRISULFIDE (DMTS). THE CURRENT METHODS USED TO MANAGE MALODOR ARE: (A) REDUCING BIOBURDENS THAT CAUSE ODOR, (B) MASKING THE ODOR, AND (C) ABSORBING THE ODOR (E.G., VIA CHARCOAL, GREEN TEA TEABAGS, CAT LITTER, ETC.).

THIS NEW STRATEGY HAS NEVER BEEN REPORTED BEFORE. WE WILL SELECTIVELY OXIDIZE ALGINATE (A NATURAL ANIONIC POLYMER) TO GENERATE COVALENTLY BONDED ALDEHYDE GROUPS FOR CHARCOAL COATING TO FORM POROUS AMINE-REACTIVE SORBENTS. IN THIS DESIGN, THE CHARCOAL WILL SORB POLYAMINES (E.G., PUTRESCINE AND CADAVERINE) TO REDUCE THEIR CONTENTS, THE CARBOXYLIC ACID GROUPS ON THE ALGINATE WILL IONICALLY IMMOBILIZE THE AMINES THROUGH ACID/BASE REACTIONS, AND THE ALDEHYDE GROUPS WILL COVALENTLY IMMOBILIZE THE AMINES THROUGH THE FORMATION OF ODORLESS IMINE STRUCTURES. ALSO, WE WILL USE CHITOSAN, A NATURAL CATIONIC POLYMER, TO COAT BENZOYL PEROXIDE (BPO), A MILD OXIDIZER FOR ACNE TREATMENT, ONTO CHARCOAL TO FORM POROUS ACID-/DMTS-REACTIVE SORBENTS. THE CHARCOAL WILL SORB THE ACIDS (E.G., N-BUTYRIC, N-VALERIC, AND N-CAPROIC) AND DMTS, THE CHITOSAN WILL REACT WITH THE ACIDS TO FORM ODORLESS SALTS THROUGH ACID/BASE REACTION, AND THE BPO WILL OXIDIZE THE DMTS TO TRANSFORM IT INTO SULFOXIDE AND THIOSULFINATE DERIVATIVES WITH A MUCH LESS UNPLEASANT ODOR.

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO APPLY AN INNOVATIVE, THEORY-DRIVEN METHOD FOR ASSESSING COMMUNICATION CALLED COMMUNICATION QUALITY ANALYSIS (CQA), TO THE LARGEST KNOWN DATASET OF AUDIO-RECORDED ICU FAMILY MEETINGS (R01HL094553). CQA IS A NOVEL METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED BY CO-PIS VAN SCOY AND SCOTT THAT IS GROUNDED IN MULTIPLE GOALS THEORY. THE METHOD ASSUMES THAT CLINICAL COMMUNICATION INVOLVES THREE TYPES OF GOALS: TASK (E.G., MAKING PATIENT-CENTERED GOALS OF CARE DECISIONS), RELATIONAL (E.G., AFFIRMING THE CLINICIAN-FAMILY RELATIONSHIP), AND IDENTITY (E.G., RESPECTING OTHERS). HIGH QUALITY COMMUNICATION OCCURS WHEN ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO ALL GOALS; LOW QUALITY COMMUNICATION OCCURS WHEN ANY GOAL IS IGNORED.

THE INCIDENCE OF CHRONIC PAIN IN SCD IS HIGH AND IS LIKELY TO INCREASE AS AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS TRANSITION THROUGH YOUNG ADULTHOOD. HOWEVER, BLACK ADULTS WITH SCD OFTEN ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES IN OBTAINING COMPREHENSIVE CARE FOR CHRONIC PAIN THAT INCLUDES BEHAVIORAL PAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. AS A RESULT, CHRONIC PAIN IS TYPICALLY MANAGED WITH OPIOIDS BUT OPIOIDS ALONE ARE OFTEN SUBOPTIMAL, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND THEIR USE IS LIMITED BY ACCESS RESTRICTIONS DUE TO THE CURRENT OPIOID EPIDEMIC IN THE UNITED STATES. THEREFORE, ALTERNATIVE, EVIDENCE-BASED, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF CHRONIC PAIN AND SUPPORT PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT IN THE HOME SETTING IN ORDER TO DECREASE THE BURDEN OF SCD AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS. VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) IS A TIMELY AND INNOVATIVE TOOL THAT HAS RESULTED IN PAIN REDUCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO EXPERIENCE CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS, SUCH AS COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME, FIBROMYALGIA, AND CHRONIC MIGRAINES. WHILE VR APPLICATIONS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN USED IN A CLINIC OR HOSPITAL SETTING PRIMARILY FOR ACUTE PAIN, COST REDUCTIONS AND ADVANCES IN THE TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED THE POTENTIAL FOR ITS LONG-TERM USE AT HOME. IN ADDITION, THE POPULARITY OF MOBILE AND GAMING TECHNOLOGY AMONG YOUNG ADULTS SUGGESTS THAT VR IS A PROMISING DELIVERY PLATFORM. THEREFORE, VR MAY BE UTILIZED TO IMPLEMENT HOME-BASED CHRONIC PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT FOR ADULTS WITH SCD.

AMONG THE 30 MILLION AMERICANS WHO HAVE DM, MORE THAN 20 MILLION ALSO HAVE HTN. SELF- MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS IS A PROMISING STRATEGY FOR PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL CO- OCCURRING DISEASES AND RESULTING IN REDUCED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. SELF-MONITORING HEALTH INDICATORS (E.G., BLOOD PRESSURE [BP], GLUCOSE) IS A KEY COMPONENT OF SUCCESSFUL SELF-MANAGEMENT. THROUGH SELF-MONITORING, PATIENTS CAN RECOGNIZE PATTERNS IN THEIR HEALTH INDICATORS, OBTAIN MORE HEALTH INFORMATION, AND CHANGE HEALTH BEHAVIORS.  TO MEET THE SELF-MANAGEMENT NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH COMORBID DM AND HTN, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A VOICE-ACTIVATED SELF-MONITORING (VOIS) SUPPORT APPLICATION ON A SMART SPEAKER PLATFORM THAT INCLUDES THREE TYPES OF FEARUES 1) SELF-MONITORING FEATURES, INCLUDING VOICE-ACTIVATED DATA ENTRY (I.E., GLUCOSE AND BP), SMART NOTES TO RECORD LIFESTYLE-RELATED EPISODES THAT COULD RESULT IN UNUSUAL VALUES OF BIOMARKERS, AND SMART SPEECH REMINDERS; 2) CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT FEATURES, INCLUDING AN EVIDENCE-BASED KNOWLEDGE BASE WITH AI ENGINE FOR DM AND FOR HTN, AND 3) SHARED DECISION-MAKING FEATURES, INCLUDING VISUALIZATION OF PATIENT DATA ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AND AN AUDIO BRIEFING OF PATIENT DATA ON A SMART SPEAKER.

COLONOSCOPY IS THE MOST ACCURATE CRC SCREENING METHOD AND RESULTS IN THE MOST YEARS OF LIFE SAVED. IT ONLY REQUIRES RESCREENING EVERY 10 YEARS, BUT IT IS A CLINIC- BASED PROCEDURE AND NEEDS EXTENSIVE PREPARATION. OTHER SCREENING OPTIONS INCLUDE HOME-BASED TESTS THAT DETECT BLOOD IN THE STOOL AND REQUIRE RESCREENING EVERY YEAR. MORE RECENTLY, A HOME-BASED METHOD HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT TESTS STOOL FOR DNA INDICATIVE OF CRC AND REQUIRES RESCREENING EVERY 3 YEARS. CURRENT GUIDELINES RECOMMEND CRC SCREENING FOR AVERAGE RISK ADULTS STARTING BETWEEN AGES 45-50, BUT PEOPLE AT HIGHER RISK SHOULD START AT YOUNGER AGES.

DUE TO THE TIME-EFFICACY RELATIONSHIP ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE STROKE INTERVENTIONS, TOOLS WHICH ALLOW FOR ACCURATE STROKE DIAGNOSIS DURING TRIAGE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO STREAMLINE CARE AND IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES.

BARRIERS INCLUDE RESOURCE- INTENSIVE DESIGNS THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH CLINICAL WORKFLOWS (E.G., MULTIPLE IN-PERSON VISITS OR PHONE SESSIONS WITH HEALTHCARE SERVICE PROVIDERS) AND A LACK OF HEALTHCARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO CAREGIVERS. MAKING DELIVERY CHANNEL ADAPTATIONS COULD FACILITATE CLINICAL UPTAKE, AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES, BUT LITTLE GUIDANCE FOR ADAPTING IN-PERSON/TELEPHONE-BASED FBIS FOR DELIVERY VIA WEB/MOBILE PLATFORMS EXISTS. THIS STUDY USES IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE (IS) AND HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION PRINCIPLES TO DEVELOP A MODEL FOR ADAPTING FBIS FOR DIGITAL DELIVERY WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING UPTAKE IN ONCOLOGY CLINICAL CARE SETTINGS. WE WILL ADAPT A HIGHLY PROMISING TELEPHONE-BASED FBI CALLED SHARE (SPOUSES COPING WITH THE HEAD AND NECK RADIATION EXPERIENCE) FOR DELIVERY VIA MOBILE WEB (AIM 1), EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND NON-INFERIORITY OF THE NEW SHARE 2.0 PROTOTYPE (AIM 2A), AND ELUCIDATE FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARE 2.0 (AIM 2B). FOR AIM 1, WE WILL ADAPT SHARE THROUGH COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS BY ASSEMBLING A STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE (SAC) OF 6 HNC PATIENTS AND 6 CAREGIVERS TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON UNADAPTED SHARE MATERIALS AND DESIRED TECHNICAL FEATURES OF SHARE 2.0 TO INFORM AN ADAPTATION BLUEPRINT. NEXT, WE WILL APPLY THE ACCELERATED CREATION-TO- SUSTAINMENT (ACTS) MODEL TO ITERATIVELY DEVELOP SHARE 2.0 FOLLOWED BY USABILITY TESTING WITH 5 PATIENTS AND 5 CAREGIVERS. THE OUTCOME WILL BE A FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE THAT IS FREE FROM SIGNIFICANT USABILITY ERRORS. FOR AIM 2A, WE WILL CONDUCT A SINGLE-ARM TRIAL OF SHARE 2.0 WITH 65 PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADS. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETE SURVEYS BEFORE INITIATING EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY (EBRT) AND 1 MONTH POST-EBRT. WE WILL JUDGE THE TRIAL FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IF RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH AT LEAST 70% OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS/CAREGIVERS ENROLLING AND AT LEAST 80% REPORTING SATISFACTION WITH CONTENT/LOGISTICS. WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE WHETHER SHARE 2.0 PERFORMS COMPARABLY TO SHARE BY COMPARING FINDINGS FROM THIS TRIAL TO THE RESULTS OF THE ORIGINAL SHARE PILOT TRIAL. FOR AIM 2B, WE WILL APPLY THE RE-AIM (REACH, EFFECTIVENESS, ADOPTION, IMPLEMENTATION, MAINTENANCE) QUEST (QUALITATIVE EVALUATION FOR SYSTEMATIC TRANSLATION) MIXED-METHODS FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL/ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE FUTURE ADOPTION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND SUSTAINABILITY OF SHARE 2.0 BEFORE PROCEEDING TO A HYBRID IMPLEMENTATION-EFFECTIVENESS TRIAL.

CHRONIC BACK PAIN (CBP) IS THE MOST COMMON PAIN DISORDER AND ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS FOR PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS. STRATEGIES TO HELP REDUCE CBP PAIN WITHOUT OPIOIDS ARE THEREFORE URGENT. A PROMISING OPIOID ALTERNATIVE ARE PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS THAT REDUCE PAIN INTENSITY, INTERFERENCE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS, AND DO NOT JUST TARGET THE PHYSICAL PAIN INTENSITY AS MANY OF THE TRADITIONAL PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES DO. HOWEVER, THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE NOT OFTEN TEMPORALLY ALIGNED WITH PAIN EPISODES.  WE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH DIAGNOSTIC PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF ONGOING CLINICAL PAIN BY CAPTURING ONGOING CLINICAL PAIN AND THE ASSOCIATED PHYSIOLOGICAL FLUCTUATIONS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES. WE WILL DEVELOP FULLY AUTOMATED REAL-TIME DETECTION OF ONGOING PAIN IN N=80 CBP PATIENTS FROM PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNS COLLECTED IN EVERYDAY LIFE. WE WILL RECORD MULTIPLE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS (ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM (EEG), FACIAL ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG), ELECTROOCULOGRAPHY (EOG), ELECTRODERMAL ACTIVITY (EDA), AND HEART RATE (HR)) FROM TWO WEARABLE DEVICE, ONE WORN AROUND THE EARS (EARABLE) AND ONE WORN AROUND THE WRIST (EMPATICA). THE SENSING SYSTEM WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH AN EXPERIENCE SAMPLING METHOD (ESM) SMARTPHONE APP TO COLLECT RATINGS OF PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN EPISODES. OUR GOAL IN AIM 1 IS TO ESTABLISH COMPUTATIONAL PHYSIOLOGY-BASED MODELS THAT CAN PREDICT CLINICAL PAIN IN REAL-LIFE. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE WILL APPLY MACHINE-LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA PRECEDING PAIN SELF-REPORTS TO BUILD PREDICTIVE MODELS OF ONGOING PAIN, WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR THESE COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO BE ABLE TO TRIGGER PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WHEN NEEDED MOST, WHICH WE AIM TO DEVELOP IN OUR FUTURE RESEARCH. OUR GOAL IN AIM 2 IS TO FIELD-TEST THESE COMPUTATIONAL MODELS IN A NEW GROUP OF N=20 CBP PATIENTS.  THE PROPOSED WORK WILL AFFORD, FOR THE FIRST TIME, AUTONOMOUS MONITORING OF CLINICAL PAIN IN REAL-LIFE. IF THE REAL-LIFE PAIN EXPERIENCE OF PATIENTS CAN BE CAPTURED IN PHYSIOLOGICAL PATTERNS PRECEDING PAIN, THEN AUTOMATED TRACKING OF PHYSIOLOGY HAS CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE EFFICACY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS, BY PROVIDING SIGNALS TO TRIGGER JUST-IN-TIME INTERVENTIONS.

HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE ACCESS AMONG YOUNG LATINA WOMEN IN THE US SOUTH - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSED STUDY ARE TO DEVELOP AND EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF AN INNOVATIVE, SCALABLE MHEALTH, \u201cSAFE SPACE\u201d INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG LATINA WOMEN (YLW) IN ALABAMA (AL) AND TO STIMULATE THE CONDUCT OF BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF AL. YLW ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY SEXUAL HEALTH DISPARITIES COMPARED TO THEIR NON-HISPANIC WHITE COUNTERPARTS. HISPANIC YOUTH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY THAN THEIR NON-HISPANIC BLACK AND NON-HISPANIC WHITE COUNTERPARTS TO HAVE A USUAL PLACE FOR PREVENTIVE CARE. EVIDENCE-BASED, CULTURALLY RELEVANT SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMMING IS LARGELY UNAVAILABLE IN THE STATE. THERE IS A NEED FOR ACCESSIBLE, EFFECTIVE AND SCALABLE SEXUAL HEALTH AND SEXUAL HEALTHCARE ACCESS (SHCA) INTERVENTIONS FOR YLW. THE VIRTUAL PROMOTORAS PROGRAM (VIP) SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS NEED. THE VIP WILL CREATE A VIRTUAL \u201cSAFE SPACE\u201d FOR YLW TO LEARN ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH AND SHCA SO THAT THEY CAN BECOME EMPOWERED TO EFFECTIVELY CARE FOR THEIR SEXUAL HEALTH AND ENGAGE WITH THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS IN TURN, CAN HELP THEM ACHIEVE IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES (I.E., LOWERED UNPLANNED PREGNANCY AND STI RATES). OVER THE LAST 6 YEARS, WE HAVE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE FORMATIVE WORK WITH ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF THE LATINO/A/X COMMUNITY, GUIDED BY COMMUNITY BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR). THIS STUDY IS THE NEXT NATURAL STEP IN THIS RESEARCH. THE VIP MHEALTH TOOL (MOBILE ENABLED WEBSITE WHICH WILL LOOK AND FEEL LIKE A MOBILE APPLICATION BUT CAN BE ACCESSED FROM OTHER DEVICES) WILL BE A VIRTUAL \u201cSAFE SPACE\u201d WHERE YLW CAN: LEARN ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH AND SHCA (EDUCATIONAL MODULES); CONNECT WITH \u201cVIRTUAL PROMOTORAS\u201d WHO CAN PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND ADVICE ON HOW TO NAVIGATE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM; AND CREATE A SEXUAL HEALTH PLAN (I.E., A GOAL SETTING AND PATIENT/PROVIDER COMMUNICATION TOOL). TO OUR KNOWLEDGE NO OTHER RESEARCHERS IN THE US SOUTH ARE WORKING WITH YLW TO ADAPT EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH EDUCATION AND PEER NAVIGATOR MODEL TO AN ELECTRONIC FORMAT WITH THE AIM OF EMPOWERING YLW TO CARE FOR THEIR SEXUAL HEALTH, INCREASING SEXUAL HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND UTILIZATION AND DECREASING SEXUAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE: (1) DEVELOP AND EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A THEORY-BASED, CULTURALLY RELEVANT SEXUAL HEALTHCARE ACCESS INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG LATINA WOMEN; AND (2) ESTIMATE THE PARAMETERS REQUIRED TO SIZE A GROUP RANDOMIZED TRIAL FOR THE EVALUATION OF EFFICACY OF THE VIP PROGRAM. THE PROPOSED CBPR STUDY WOULD ALSO CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR UA STUDENTS TO BECOME INVOLVED IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND FOR UA TO GROW OUR RESEARCH ENTERPRISE.

A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE PROBLEM BECAUSE OF ITS PREVALENCE, ITS IMPACT ON THOSE WHO SUFFER, AND THE ABSENCE OF CONSISTENTLY EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS DEVOID OF DELETERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. THESE ISSUES WILL ONLY BE COMPOUNDED WITH THE AGING OF THE US POPULATION AND THE INCREASED INCIDENCE OF PAIN IN THOSE OVER 60 YEARS OLD. ANY PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THIS GROWING PROBLEM WILL TAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT FROM THE BASIC SCIENTISTS STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND PAIN MECHANISMS TO THE CLINICIANS STRUGGLING TO MANAGE PAIN IN THEIR PATIENTS WITH LIMITED TOOLS AND RESOURCES. IT WILL ALSO TAKE A SUSTAINED EFFORT THAT INCLUDES THOSE ALREADY WORKING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS OF PAIN SCIENTISTS. THE US ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF PAIN (USASP) WAS FORMED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND CONTINUES TO DEVELOP WAYS OF DOING SO. ONE OF THEIR SOLUTIONS IS AN ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETING ORGANIZED TO FACILITATE CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND MENTORING OF PAIN SCIENTISTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITH A FOCUS ON EARLY CAREER SCHOLARS, FACILITATE DIALOG AMONG PAIN SCIENTISTS AND CLINICIANS WITHIN AND BETWEEN DISCIPLINES OR AREAS OF STUDY, AND DISSEMINATE IMPORTANT RESEARCH FINDINGS. TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE USASP AND THE SCIENTIFIC MEETING ARE ORGANIZED AROUND PRINCIPLES OF DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION, WHERE ALL INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING THE COMPLEX PROBLEM OF PAIN ARE WELCOMED TO PARTICIPATE. THE PRESENT APPLICATION IS TO SECURE SUPPORT FOR TRAINEES TO ATTEND THE USASP ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS FROM 2022 TO 2026, STARTING WITH THE MAY, 2022 MEETING IN CINCINNATI, OH. CONSISTENT WITH THE BROADER GOALS OF THE USASP FOR THE SCIENTIFIC MEETING, THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO 1) PROVIDE A NATIONAL FORUM FOR CONFERENCE ATTENDEES TO DISCUSS PAIN RESEARCH FINDINGS THAT SHAPE THE DIRECTION OF THE FIELD, 2) FOSTER INTERDISCIPLINARY DIALOGUE AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN RESEARCHERS REPRESENTING MULTIPLE PAIN SCIENCE DISCIPLINES IN TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE TRANSLATIONAL STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS CURRENT CHALLENGES IN PAIN RESEARCH, AND 3) ENHANCE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PAIN SCIENCE STAKEHOLDERS (RESEARCHERS, POLICY MAKERS, CLINICIANS, AND PATIENTS) AND BOTH JUNIOR AND SENIOR RESEARCHERS TO PROVIDE MENTORING AND BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN DIFFERENT PAIN SCIENCE COMMUNITIES.

SBHCS PROVIDE VITAL SERVICES TO SCHOOL-AGED YOUTH, INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL, SEXUAL, AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE, OFTEN REGARDLESS OF PATIENTS' INSURANCE STATUS OR ABILITY TO PAY. YOUNG PATIENTS WHO ARE GENDER OR SEXUAL MINORITY (GSM) ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES THAN THEIR CISGENDER AND HETEROSEXUAL PEERS. STRUCTURAL OR SOCIETAL-BASED FACTORS (E.G., STIGMA, DISCRIMINATION, LOW AWARENESS OF AND INSENSITIVITY TOWARDS THEIR HEALTH CONCERNS) CONTRIBUTE TO GREATER UNMET NEEDS AND POORER QUALITY OF CARE FOR GSM YOUTH. STRUCTURAL COMPETENCY ADDRESSES THE UPSTREAM FACTORS (SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, INADEQUATE AND FRAGMENTED TREATMENT, INEQUITIES IN CARE) THAT AFFECT GSM STUDENTS. ENHANCING STRUCTURAL COMPETENCY WITHIN SBHCS WILL IMPROVE THE CARE RECEIVED BY GSM STUDENTS AND, THEREFORE, THEIR HEALTH. EMERGING STRUCTURAL COMPETENCY FRAMEWORKS CALL FOR THE CULTIVATION OF AWARENESS AND CAPACITIES IN SBHCS TO MODIFY ORGANIZATIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING PROVIDER AND STAFF KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIORS, TO INFLUENCE WELLBEING WITHIN THIS SOCIALLY MARGINALIZED ADOLESCENT POPULATION. NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED RECOMMENDATIONS OR GUIDELINES FOR NURTURING STRUCTURAL COMPETENCY INCLUDE (1) ADOPTION, DISSEMINATION, AND ENFORCEMENT OF GSM SUPPORTIVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES; (2) CREATION OF WELCOMING PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS FOR GSM PATIENTS; (3) SYSTEMATIC DOCUMENTATION AND USE OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY (SOGI) INFORMATION TO INFORM AND IMPROVE CLINICAL SERVICES; (4) ONGOING TRAINING FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IN BEST PRACTICES FOR INTERACTING WITH GSM PATIENTS; AND (5) CLINICAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO ENCOURAGE DELIVERY OF HIGH-QUALITY SERVICES TO GSM PATIENTS.

STAGNANT WAGES AND RISING RENTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES HAVE RESULTED IN UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF HOUSING COST BURDEN IN THE U.S. AND, IN TURN, FORCED MILLIONS OF RENTERS TO FACE THE THREAT OF EVICTION EACH YEAR. THE PANDEMIC WORSENED THIS CRISIS, RESULTING IN CATASTROPHIC JOB AND WAGE LOSS, ESPECIALLY FOR BLACK, HISPANIC, AND FEMALE RENTERS WHO ALREADY EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST RATES OF HOUSING INSECURITY. TO PREVENT A SURGE IN EVICTIONS, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL POLICYMAKERS ESTABLISHED A RANGE OF EVICTION PREVENTION POLICIES, MOST NOTABLY EVICTION MORATORIA AND EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE (ERA). THESE POLICIES VARIED ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN HOW AND WHEN THEY WERE IMPLEMENTED, CREATING LARGE EXOGENOUS VARIATION IN EVICTION RISK. WE EXPLOIT THAT VARIATION TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF EVICTION ON MORTALITY AND INEQUALITIES IN MORTALITY. IN SO DOING, WE PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE POTENTIAL FOR EVICTION PREVENTION POLICIES TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY.

WE ALSO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF LIVES SAVED BY EVICTION PREVENTION POLICIES AND PROJECT MORTALITY GAINS HAD MORE PROTECTIVE MEASURES BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY IMPLEMENTED. 2) WE ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF EVICTION PREVENTION POLICIES ON COUNTY-LEVEL MORTALITY USING A DIFFERENCE-AND-DIFFERENCES FRAMEWORK. WE ANALYZE HOW THE STAGGERED LIFTING OF EVICTION MORATORIA (2020) AND DISBURSAL OF ERA (2021-22) AFFECTED ALL-CAUSE, CAUSE- SPECIFIC, AND AGE-SPECIFIC ADULT MORTALITY, WITH A FOCUS ON RACIAL/ETHNIC AND GENDER VARIATIONS IN THESE ASSOCIATIONS. 3) WE EXPLORE THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF EVICTION PREVENTION POLICIES USING IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW DATA COLLECTED WITH A DIVERSE SAMPLE OF RENTERS ACROSS TWO DISTINCT POLICY LANDSCAPES.

THE SIGNIFICANT RACIAL INEQUITIES IN SMM AND MORTALITY ARE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ARE A RESULT OF HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY STRUCTURAL AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS INCLUDING INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIETAL POLICIES. INTEGRATING A RACIAL EQUITY LENS TO MEDICAID POLICY INTERVENTIONS IS A PROMISING STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING THE LONG-STANDING RACIAL INEQUITIES IN SMM AND BROADLY IN MATERNAL HEALTH. IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, MEDICAID IS IMPLEMENTING POLICY INTERVENTIONS THAT EXPLICITLY FOCUS ON BLACK POPULATIONS. THREE POLICY INTERVENTIONS WILL BE THE FOCUS OF THIS STUDY: THE EQUITY INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM, THE EQUITY- FOCUSED OBSTETRIC CARE BUNDLED PAYMENT MODEL AND THE REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM FOR DOULA SERVICES.

THESE INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFICACIOUS WHEN COMPARED TO LARGELY INERT CONTROL CONDITIONS; HOWEVER, RECENT META-ANALYSES INDICATE THAT MOST OF THESE TREATMENTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY MODEST EFFECTS ON PRIMARY OUTCOMES. THIS IS A CRITICAL SHORTCOMING OF THESE OTHERWISE PROMISING APPROACHES. RATHER THAN ATTEMPTING TO BOOST EFFICACY ONLY BY DEVELOPING NEW AND HOPEFULLY MORE POWERFUL INTERVENTIONS, WE CAN ALSO LOOK WITHIN OUR ALREADY PROVEN TREATMENTS FOR WAYS TO ENHANCE THE MAGNITUDE OF TREATMENT EFFECTS. ONE STRATEGY IS TO INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF TREATMENT MEDIATORS. STUDIES OF MEDIATORS ARE NEEDED THAT DIRECTLY COMPARE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS WITH EACH OTHER TO DETERMINE WHICH MEDIATORS ARE TREATMENT-SPECIFIC, WHICH ARE SHARED ACROSS TREATMENTS, AND WHICH CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO CLINICAL OUTCOMES. THE FINDINGS FROM SUCH RESEARCH COULD BE USED TO INFORM ADAPTATIONS TO EXISTING TREATMENT THAT ENHANCE THEIR BENEFITS. A SECOND STRATEGY FOR INCREASING THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF EXISTING TREATMENTS IS TO IDENTIFY THE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS THAT MODERATE TREATMENT RESPONSES. RESEARCH IS NEEDED THAT IS GUIDED BY THEORETICAL MODELS AND THAT TESTS MODERATORS ACROSS MULTIPLE TREATMENTS. IDENTIFYING SUBGROUPS OF PATIENTS MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND TO ONE OR ANOTHER TREATMENT CAN ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE BY INFORMING A PRIORI PATIENT-TREATMENT MATCHES THAT CAN OPTIMIZE TREATMENT EFFECTS.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A SINGLE SET OF PHBHPC QUALITY DOMAINS INTEGRATING NEWLY-IDENTIFIED, PATIENT-PRIORITIZED PERSPECTIVES WITH THOSE FROM CLINICIANS AND PARENTS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WILL USE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THEIR CARE THAN PROVIDERS OR PARENTS.

LIMITING THE CAPACITY OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS TO ENGAGE WITH THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. CAREGIVERS ARE CRITICAL FOR THIS POPULATION BECAUSE THEY ASSIST WITH COMPLEX DECISION MAKING, CARE COORDINATION AND PATIENT ADVOCACY. STRUCTURAL RACISM REFERS TO THE TOTALITY OF WAYS IN WHICH SOCIETIES FOSTER RACIAL DISCRIMINATION THROUGH MUTUALLY REINFORCING SYSTEMS (SUCH AS HOUSING, EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, AND HEALTHCARE) THAT ULTIMATELY AFFECT HEALTH OUTCOMES.

COMMUNITY GROUP-BASED WALKING PROGRAMS ARE WIDELY USED BECAUSE OF THE STRONG EVIDENCE BASE FOR INCREASING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THROUGH INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS.

THE CURRENT STANDARD OF OUTPATIENT MS CARE DEPENDS ON IN-CLINIC VISITS, BUT MS PATIENTS FACE MANY BARRIERS TO ACCESSING THIS CARE. THESE BARRIERS INCLUDE THOSE RESULTING FROM THE DISEASE ITSELF, SUCH AS PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS, DRIVING RESTRICTIONS AND FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS, AND THEY ARE FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY AN OVERALL SHORTAGE OF NEUROLOGISTS. FURTHERMORE, MS CARE HAS A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACT, WITH THE ESTIMATED INDIRECT AND DIRECT COSTS FOR TREATING MS IN THE US ESTIMATED TO BE > $48 BILLION. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO AND REDUCE COST OF MS CARE, AND TELEHEALTH IS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION. BOTH OUR TWO MULTIDISCIPLINARY MS CENTERS (UCSF AND CLEVELAND CLINIC) HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT TELEHEALTH FOR MS CARE IS FEASIBLE AND THAT IT RESULTS IN TRAVEL SAVINGS FOR PATIENTS, REDUCTION IN MISSED WORK, AND REDUCTION IN CAREGIVER BURDEN.

STUDY FINDINGS PROVIDE SUPPORT OF PROTOCOL FEASIBILITY AND INTERVENTION ACCEPTABILITY, WITH QUALITATIVE FINDINGS LEADING US TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS PLAYS AS A KEY ROLE IN SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT. ALSO, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED EPIGENETIC PATTERNS UNIQUELY RELATED TO POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; WE WILL EVALUATE THE SIMILARITY OF THESE DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS RELATED TO SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS AND POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, AS AN EXPLORATION OF MECHANISMS OF SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS. STUDY DESIGN: USING A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK BASED UPON INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY SELF-MANAGEMENT THEORY, THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS TWO-ARM LONGITUDINAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS AND MECHANISMS OF THIS SELF-MANAGEMENT APPROACH IN MARGINALIZED WOMEN WITH DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (N=200), COMPARED TO AN ACTIVE CONTROL. THE FIRST SPECIFIC AIM IS TO EVALUATE EFFECTS BY GROUP ON DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOM SEVERITY, ANXIETY, AND PERCEIVED STRESS OVER TIME. THE SECOND SPECIFIC AIM IS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS AS A MODERATOR OF THE EFFECTS OF GROUP ASSIGNMENT ON DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. THE THIRD SPECIFIC AIM IS TO IDENTIFY GENOME-WIDE DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS. POTENTIAL IMPACT: THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF OUR AIMS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS AS A MECHANISM TO DECREASE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN A LARGELY UNDERSTUDIED, HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED POPULATION OF WOMEN.

PATIENTS WITH HNC EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT NPS, SUCH AS FATIGUE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION, AND SLEEP PROBLEMS. THESE SYMPTOMS OFTEN OCCUR AS A CLUSTER, INFLUENCE TREATMENT RESPONSES, PREDICT WORSE SURVIVAL AMONG HNC PATIENTS, AND HAVE A MORE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PATIENT OUTCOMES AND SURVIVAL THAN INDIVIDUAL SYMPTOMS. OUR EARLIER WORK, ALONG WITH OTHERS, HAVE SHOWN A ROBUST LINK BETWEEN PERIPHERAL INFLAMMATION AND THESE NPS. HOWEVER, THE BIOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO INFLAMMATION ARE STILL NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND THE MANAGEMENT OF NPS IS STILL CHALLENGING. AN EMERGING APPRECIATION OF THE GUT-BRAIN CONNECTION HAS SUGGESTED THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE GUT MICROBIOME IN NPS. MICROBIOME DYSBIOSIS HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN COMPLEX SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, COGNITION, SLEEP, AND PAIN. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA INDICATE THAT TAXA ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH INFLAMMATION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH NPS. MOREOVER, THE GUT MICROBIOME IS BELIEVED TO PALY IMMUNOMUDOLATORY ROLES, IN PART MEDIATED BY SHORT-CHAIN FATTY ACIDS (SCFAS), THE MOST ABUNDANT METABOLITES OF BACTERIAL FERMENTATION OF DIETARY FIBERS IN THE GUT. SCFAS NOT ONLY PLAY KEY ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND IMMUNOMODULATORY ROLES WITHIN THE GUT AND PERIPHERY, BUT ALSO CROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER LEADING TO DECREASES IN NEUROINFLAMMATION AND IMPROVEMENT IN BRAIN HOMEOSTASIS. OUR PRELIMINARY GUT MICROBIOME DATA SUGGEST LOWER ABUNDANCE IN SCFA-PRODUCING TAXA IN PATIENTS WITH HIGH NPS. OUR PILOT DATA ON PLASMA SCFAS ECHO THIS TREND BY SHOWING THAT LOWER CIRCULATING BUTYRATE, A MAIN SCFA PRODUCED BY THE GUT BACTERIA, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH NPS. THESE NEW EXCITING DATA SUGGEST THAT A RESTORATION OF DEPLETED BACTERIA OR THEIR METABOLITES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REVERSE THE DYSBIOSIS-ASSOCIATED PHENOTYPES. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF 350 HNC PATIENTS RECEIVING ACTIVE TREATMENT TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE GUT MICROBIOME AND NPS BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT. PATIENTS WITH HNC ALSO HAVE A HIGH RISK OF DYSBIOSIS DUE TO SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS (I.E., MUCOSITIS, DRY MOUTH, AND DIFFICULTY OPENING MOUTH) OF CANCER TREATMENT. THESE DEBILITATING AND LONG-LASTING SIDE EFFECTS REDUCE PATIENTS' CAPABILITY FOR FOOD INTAKE, AND COULD RESULT IN MARKED CHANGES IN GUT MICROBIOME AND SUBSEQUENTLY SCFAS. TAKEN TOGETHER, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT CANCER TREATMENT-INDUCED ALTERATIONS IN THE GUT MICROBIOTA AND RESULTING REDUCTIONS IN SCFAS CONTRIBUTE TO HIGH PERIPHERAL INFLAMMATION AND THEN NPS.

PAIN IS EXPERIENCED AT SOME POINT BY MOST PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC CANCER. PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS ARE A CORNERSTONE OF TREATING PAIN; THE PREVALENT BELIEF IN THE FIELD HAS BEEN THAT THE BENEFITS OF PALLIATING PAIN IN METASTATIC CANCER WITH OPIOIDS NEARLY ALWAYS OUTWEIGH ANY POTENTIAL HARMS. THIS APPROACH TO OPIOID-RELATED DECISIONS IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC CANCER IMPLIES THAT PATIENTS\u2019 PROGNOSES ARE EITHER SO SHORT THAT THESE HARMS ARE NOT MEANINGFUL, OR THAT BENEFITS OF OPIOIDS ARE SUBSTANTIAL WHILE HARMS ARE RELATIVELY MINIMAL.

HYPOTHESIS 2B: YOUNGER AGE, HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER, AND HISTORY OF MOOD DISORDERS WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER RISK OF OPIOID MISUSE AND USE DISORDER. APPROACH: WE WILL USE LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODELS (2A) AND TIME-TO-EVENT ANALYSES (2B).

AS PERSISTENT PAIN EXPERIENCE ROBUSTLY PREDICTS POORER QUALITY OF LIFE OVERALL, RACIAL PAIN CARE DISPARITIES REPRESENT A CENTRAL FACTOR FUELING LARGER SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. WHILE PREVIOUS WORK HAS IDENTIFIED A HOST OF PATIENT AND PROVIDER FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTHCARE IN GENERAL AND THUS ALSO LIKELY CONTRIBUTING TO DISPARITIES IN PAIN CARE, THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED CLINICALLY-MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN ELIMINATING THESE DISPARITIES. THUS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO ADDRESS THIS DECADES-OLD INEQUITY BY TAKING AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH. WE ARGUE THAT THIS LACK OF PROGRESS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT PRIOR RESEARCH HAS INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF PATIENT AND PROVIDER FACTORS IN ISOLATION, RATHER THAN EXAMINING THEIR INTERACTION. SUCCESSFUL PAIN CARE REQUIRES CONSTRUCTIVE PATIENT-PROVIDER COMMUNICATION, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COMMUNICATION IS BOTH DYADIC AND DYNAMIC. THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ESTABLISH THE DYADIC AND DYNAMIC PROCESSES UNDERLYING PATIENT-PROVIDER COMMUNICATION AS THE KEY MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH PATIENT AND PROVIDER FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO RACIAL DISPARITIES IN BOTH PATIENT- CENTERED AND CLINICAL PAIN OUTCOMES. ONE WELL-ACCEPTED OPERATIONALIZATION OF SUCH DYADIC PROCESSES IS BEHAVIORAL COORDINATION (I.E., SPATIAL/TEMPORAL MATCHING IN THE RHYTHMS OR PATTERNS OF BEHAVIORS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN AN INTERACTION, SUCH AS SYNCHRONY, LEADER-AND-FOLLOWER DYNAMICS, AND TURN-TAKING). WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE PAIN OF BLACK PATIENTS CONTINUES TO BE UNDERTREATED BECAUSE BLACK (VS. WHITE) PATIENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE IN RACIALLY DISCORDANT MEDICAL INTERACTIONS (I.E., SEEING OTHER-RACE PROVIDERS) AND AS A RESULT, ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE DISRUPTIONS IN BEHAVIORAL COORDINATION. THESE HYPOTHESES WILL BE TESTED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF PREOPERATIVE CONSULTATIONS BECAUSE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN SURGICAL PAIN OUTCOMES ARE WELL- DOCUMENTED ACROSS PROCEDURES, AND FURTHER, THE QUALITY OF PREOPERATIVE CONSULTATIONS IS LINKED TO POST-SURGICAL PAIN MANAGEMENT. WE WILL USE A CONVERGENT MIXED METHODS RESEARCH DESIGN TO ASSESS BEHAVIORAL COORDINATION QUANTITATIVELY (E.G., LEVELS, DURATION, PATTERNS) AND QUALITATIVELY (E.G., VALENCE, DISCUSSION THEMES). THIS WORK WILL: AIM 1) COMPARE THE LEVELS, DURATION, PATTERNS, AND CONTEXT OF BEHAVIORAL COORDINATION IN PREOPERATIVE CONSULTATIONS (BOTH OVERALL AND DURING PAIN DISCUSSION SPECIFICALLY) BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE PATIENTS; AIM 2) ELUCIDATE LINKS BETWEEN PATIENT/PROVIDER FACTORS AND COORDINATION IN PREOPERATIVE CONSULTATIONS; AND AIM 3) IDENTIFY SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF BEHAVIORAL COORDINATION IN PREOPERATIVE CONSULTATIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO RACIAL DISPARITIES IN POST-SURGICAL PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES (E.G., PAIN MANAGEMENT SELF-EFFICACY, QUALITY OF LIFE) AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES (E.G., PAIN LEVEL, PRESCRIPTIONS). SINCE THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON PAIN MANAGEMENT SELF-EFFICACY AND QUALITY OF LIFE AS PRIMARY OUTCOMES, FINDINGS WILL BE GENERALIZABLE BEYOND SURGICAL PAIN.

UNFORTUNATELY, TREATMENT IS DIFFICULT AND LONG-TERM OUTCOMES ARE POOR, IN PART DUE TO THE LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CHRONIC PAIN MANIFESTS ACROSS THE FIRST TWO DECADES OF LIFE. CHRONIC WIDESPREAD PAIN IS COMMON IN ADULTS, AND OFTEN OCCURS IN ABSENCE OR NOT IN PROPORTION TO TISSUE DAMAGE OR INFLAMMATION. IN ADULTS, WIDESPREAD PAIN IS ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERED PROCESSING IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS), IS MORE COMMON IN FEMALES, AND IS ACCOMPANIED BY A CLUSTER OF CO-OCCURRING CENTRALLY-MEDIATED SOMATIC SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, MEMORY DIFFICULTIES AND DEPRESSION/ANXIETY. THE ALTERATIONS IN CNS PROCESSING TYPICALLY FALL INTO TWO BROAD CATEGORIES: INCREASED PRONOCICEPTIVE AND DECREASED ANTINOCICEPTIVE ACTIVITY AND FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY. WHILE THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT ADULTS WITH CONDITIONS CHARACTERIZED BY WIDESPREAD PAIN, SUCH AS FIBROMYALGIA, CAN TRACE THEIR PAIN BACK TO CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE, THE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIDESPREAD PAIN IN CHILDREN HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHETHER THESE CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOMS AND CNS CHANGES PRECEDE, CORRELATE WITH, OR ARE CONSEQUENCES OF PAIN. THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (ABCD) STUDY, A LARGE PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY OF CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT, PROVIDES AN UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE EARLY GENESIS AND TRAJECTORY OF WIDESPREAD PAIN IN ADOLESCENCE. OUR OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT CNS FACTORS AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH WIDESPREAD PAIN IN ADULTS, ARE ALSO PRESENT IN CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING WIDESPREAD PAIN EARLY IN LIFE. MOREOVER, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THERE IS A SEX-RELATED DIVERGENCE IN THESE FACTORS DURING PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN PAIN SENSITIVITY AND VULNERABILITY IN FEMALES AND A DECREASE IN MALES.

MANY OLDER ADULTS REPORT TAKING ANTI-NAUSEA MEDICATION ONLY WHEN CINV IS SEVERE AND SOME ADOPT A \u2018WATCHFUL WAITING\u201d STRATEGY AS THEY WAIT FOR CINV TO GO AWAY ON ITS OWN. THIS LACK OF SELF- MANAGEMENT LEADS TO REDUCED DAILY FUNCTIONING, REDUCED ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT, INCREASED HEALTHCARE USE (EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS) AND COST, AND LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR NEW STRATEGIES TO ASSIST OLDER ADULTS IN ENGAGING IN MORE ACTIVE PREVENTATIVE AND SELF-MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORS AT HOME TO REDUCE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. OUR TEAM DEVELOPED AND TESTED A SERIOUS GAME INTERVENTION THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES OLDER ADULTS\u2019 ERRONEOUS BELIEFS ABOUT CINV MANAGEMENT. THE ESSET-CINV INTERVENTION IS A TECHNOLOGY-BASED EDUCATIONAL SIMULATION IN WHICH OLDER ADULTS LEARN TO APPLY WHAT THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY LEARNED ABOUT CINV SELF- MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO AN AVATAR WHO IS AT HIGH RISK FOR NAUSEA AT HOME AFTER CHEMOTHERAPY. PLAYERS MAKE DECISIONS TO PREVENT CINV AND TO SELF-MANAGE IT WHEN IT OCCURS. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDY SHOWED THAT OLDER ADULTS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO THE ESSET-CINV INTERVENTION USED TWICE AS MANY CINV PREVENTATIVE STRATEGIES THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT GET THE INTERVENTION.

FOR PEOPLE FROM THE RURAL AMERICA WITH CHRONIC DISEASES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE PAIN, THE PANDEMIC CAN NOT ONLY WORSEN PAIN, BUT ALSO IT CAN TRIGGER ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, TROUBLE SLEEPING, AND SUBSTANCE USE. THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IS EXACERBATED BY PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL ISOLATION, FEAR OF SEEKING IN-PERSON VISITS, AND DIMINISHED ABILITY TO ACCESS CLINICAL CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC. ONE WAY DOCTORS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE REACHING OUT IS BY VIDEO VISITS, WHERE PATIENTS AND THEIR PROVIDERS COMMUNICATE ONLINE VIA THE INTERNET. HOWEVER, VIDEO VISITS STILL HAVE LIMITS. THEREFORE, WE CAN HELP SUPPORT THEM WITH OTHER TECHNIQUES. BEYOND VIDEO VISITS, THERE ARE HOME-BASED PROGRAMS THAT PATIENTS CAN ADMINISTER THEMSELVES TO HELP MANAGE THEIR PAIN. THESE PROVEN PROGRAMS CAN OVERCOME STAFFING SHORTFALLS, BE USED ACROSS LONG DISTANCE TO REACH ANYONE IN THE WORLD AND CAN BE USED AT THE TIME AND PLACE OF THE PATIENTS' CHOOSING.  IN THIS STUDY, WE WILL COMPARE TWO AVAILABLE, EVIDENCE-BASED, DIGITAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS THAT PATIENTS CAN USE AT HOME.

BEREAVED PARENTS ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR NUMEROUS POOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, INCLUDING PROLONGED GRIEF (PG), DEPRESSION, REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE, EXISTENTIAL DISTRESS, DECREASED WORK PRODUCTIVITY, ADVERSE HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND EVEN DEATH. DESPITE THEIR SUFFERING, BEREAVED PARENTS REPORT EMOTIONAL AND LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO RETURNING TO THE INSTITUTION WHERE THEIR CHILD WAS TREATED AND DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR SUPPORT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, RESULTING IN UNDERUTILIZATION OF SERVICES. THE NEED FOR EMPIRICALLY-SUPPORTED, CONCEPTUALLY SOUND, ACCEPTABLE, AND ACCESSIBLE INTERVENTIONS FOR BEREAVED PARENTS IS CLEAR. GRIEF RESEARCHERS HAVE LONG EMPHASIZED THE THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF FACILITATING MEANING-MAKING TO IMPROVE BEREAVEMENT OUTCOMES.

SABI ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN ONE IN 10 DEATHS GLOBALLY AND IS A LEADING CAUSE OF SERIOUS LONG-TERM DISABILITY. THOUGH ADVANCES IN ACUTE MANAGEMENT OF SABI HAVE IMPROVED THE CHANCE OF GOOD OUTCOME FOR SOME, THIS CONDITION CONTINUES TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT FOR MANY DUE TO HIGH MORTALITY, LONG-TERM DISABILITY, HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN, COMPLEX CARE TRANSITIONS, AND CHANGING GOALS OF CARE OVER TIME. YET, AS MOST STUDIES FOCUS ON MEASURES OF FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME OR MORTALITY, EVIDENCE- BASED INFORMATION ABOUT MORE GLOBAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL SYMPTOMS OVER TIME, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST WEEKS OF LIFE, IS LACKING. IN ADDITION, FAMILY MEMBERS OF PATIENTS WITH SABI ARE AT RISK FOR LONG-TERM PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE DUE TO THE BURDENS OF SURROGATE DECISION-MAKING, CAREGIVING, AND COMPLICATED GRIEF. IN CONTRAST TO MANY OTHER SERIOUS ILLNESSES, SUCH AS CANCER OR DEMENTIA, WHERE DEATH OFTEN FOLLOWS A PROGRESSIVE DECLINE IN FUNCTION, PALLIATIVE CARE PROVISION AND SERIOUS ILLNESS CONVERSATIONS AFTER SABI ARE UNIQUELY CHALLENGING DUE TO THE SUDDENNESS OF ONSET AND SUBSTANTIAL PROGNOSTIC UNCERTAINTY THAT INCLUDES THE POTENTIAL FOR RECOVERY. PALLIATIVE CARE SPECIALISTS ARE RARELY INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF THESE PATIENTS. PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SUBSTANTIAL MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS SYMPTOMS SUCH AS PAIN OR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, OR TO PREPARE FAMILIES FOR THE HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF DEATH. IN ADDITION, HOSPITAL SURVIVORS ARE RARELY DISCHARGED HOME AND FACE FRAGMENTED CARE ACROSS NURSING FACILITIES, REHABILITATION CENTERS AND HOSPITALS.

THE CENTRAL STUDY SUPPORTING THE 3 AIMS IS A 1 YEAR RANDOMIZED PREVENTION TRIAL WITH A 1 YEAR FOLLOW-UP OBSERVATIONAL STUDY IN CHILDREN WHO ARE PRE-PUBERTAL AT BASELINE AND WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE IN A HIGH-RISK GROUP FOR DEVELOPING NAFLD BECAUSE OF HISPANIC ETHNICITY AND A FIRST DEGREE RELATIVE WITH NAFLD OR TYPE 2 DIABETES. THE INTERVENTION WILL REPLACE TYPICAL DRINKS AND FOOD HIGH IN (NON-DAIRY) SUGARS WITH LOW OR NO SUGAR FOODS USING OUR ESTABLISHED METHODS INCLUDING 1) PROVISION OF FOOD FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY 2) FACILITATED GROCERY SHOPPING 3) HOME VISITS 4) BEHAVIOR CHANGE COUNSELING AND, 5) FREQUENT MONITORING. HISPANIC CHILDREN AGE 7-9 YEARS, TANNER STAGE 1, WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF NAFLD BY FAMILY HISTORY WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO LFSD INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE WITH MATCHING FOR CONTACT HOURS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS HEPATIC STEATOSIS BY MRI-PDFF AT 1 YEAR. AIM 1 TESTS WHETHER THE INTERVENTION PROTECTS AGAINST INCREASE IN HEPATIC STEATOSIS AT 1 YEAR AND NAFLD ONSET AT 2 YEARS. AIM 2 TESTS GENE VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH NAFLD, BASELINE ANTHROPOMETRICS AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY MODIFIERS OF THE IMPACT OF LFSD ON CHANGE IN HEPATIC STEATOSIS AT 1 YEAR. AIM 3 EXPLORES BIOCHEMICAL AND LIPID METABOLISM MECHANISMS UNDERLYING HEPATIC STEATOSIS AND LFSD. IN SUMMARY, THIS TRIAL WILL GENERATE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE POTENTIAL FOR USING FREE SUGAR RESTRICTION AS A NAFLD PREVENTION STRATEGY FOR CHILDREN AT INCREASED RISK OF NAFLD. THE FINDINGS WILL HAVE SUSTAINED AND SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH PROMOTION IN HISPANIC CHILDREN, REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES, AND INFORM FUTURE PREVENTION EFFORTS FOR CHILDREN AT INCREASED RISK OF NAFLD.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4d4ce585-e95e-2593-758c-86dc120820ad-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01NR019083_7529"}, {"internal_id": 131834096, "Award ID": "R01NR019058", "Award Amount": 1885692.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-05-04", "CFDA Number": "93.361", "Description": "EVALUATING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPACT OF NAVIGATOR-DELIVERED EPRO HOME SYMPTOM MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT - PROJECT SUMMARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS BY BASCH (COLLABORATOR) AND COLLEAGUES DEMONSTRATED THAT WEEKLY ELECTRONIC HOME-BASED PRO SYMPTOM MONITORING WITH AUTOMATED ALERTS TO CLINICIANS (HOME EPRO) IN CANCER PATIENTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION, IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND INCREASED OVERALL SURVIVAL. HOWEVER, THESE TRIALS WERE ADMINISTERED USING INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH FUNDING. A KNOWLEDGE GAP REMAINS ABOUT OPTIMAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES FOR AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HOME EPROS IN REAL-WORLD SETTINGS. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, INVESTIGATORS FROM TWO INSTITUTIONS WILL CONDUCT A LARGE-SCALE, POPULATION-BASED IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EVIDENCE-BASED HOME EPRO INTERVENTION FOR ALL ADULT CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY, INCLUDING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS AFRICAN AMERICANS, RURAL RESIDENTS, AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS. THIS IMPLEMENTATION WILL LEVERAGE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM MEDICARE'S PAYMENT REFORM PROJECTS (ONCOLOGY CARE MODEL, ONCOLOGY CARE FIRST MODEL), WHICH REQUIRE AND FINANCIALLY SUPPORT PATIENT NAVIGATORS, A NATURAL WORKFORCE FOR HOME EPRO IMPLEMENTATION. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE DEPLOYED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES WILL RESULT IN SUCCESSFUL NAVIGATOR-DELIVERED HOME EPRO, WHICH WILL IMPROVE BOTH PATIENT AND HEALTH SYSTEM OUTCOMES. USING THE CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH (CFIR), THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED USING A HYBRID TYPE 2 DESIGN WITH THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) EVALUATE IMPLEMENTATION OF NAVIGATOR-DELIVERED HOME EPRO FOR ALL CANCER PATIENTS ACROSS MULTIPLE PRACTICE SITES; 2) EXAMINE THE BARRIERS, FACILITATORS, AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES USED IN IMPLEMENTING NAVIGATOR- DELIVERED HOME EPRO; AND 3) ASSESS THE IMPACT OF HOME EPRO ON CLINICAL AND UTILIZATION OUTCOMES. IN AIM 1, HOME EPRO WILL BE EVALUATED USING IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES (SERVICE PENETRANCE, PROVIDER ADOPTION/PENETRATION, INTERVENTION FIDELITY).

THERE IS CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY IN SYMPTOMS IN HF, HOWEVER, THAT IS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT IN THE VULNERABLE TRANSITION PERIOD AFTER A HOSPITALIZATION FOR ACUTE DECOMPENSATED HF. WHILE SYMPTOMS IMPROVE FOR SOME PATIENTS AND THEY HAVE LONGER PERIODS OF RELATIVE STABILITY, OTHERS ARE PLAGUED BY ENDURING SYMPTOMS LEADING TO POOR OUTCOMES, INCLUDING REHOSPITALIZATION. GIVEN LITTLE-TO-NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEMODYNAMIC MARKERS (E.G. EJECTION FRACTION) AND SYMPTOMS IN HF, OUR CLINICAL EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE HEMODYNAMIC STABILITY DURING A HOSPITALIZATION MAY NOT TRANSLATE TO IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS POST-HOSPITALIZATION.

THE REASONS FOR THIS HETEROGENEITY ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MULTI-FACTORIAL, AND INVOLVE A COMPLEX INTERPLAY BETWEEN GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, THAT WE ARE ONLY STARTING TO UNDERSTAND.

INSUFFICIENT REM SLEEP HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE SUCH AS DEMENTIA, WHICH HAS SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS TO ICU DELIRIUM. LESS REM SLEEP HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN PATIENTS WITH, COMPARED TO WITHOUT ICU DELIRIUM, ALTHOUGH THE TEMPORALITY IS UNCLEAR.

\u2013 TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH IN 2019, THE US ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO END THE HIV EPIDEMIC BY 2030. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, STRATEGIES THAT IMPROVE HIV PREVENTION AND HIV TREATMENT OUTCOMES ARE NEEDED. ONLY 56% OF PEOPLE WITH HIV (PWH) WERE VIRALLY SUPPRESSED IN 2018, A CRITICAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH OUTCOMES AND TRANSMISSION RISK, AND 51% OF HIV DIAGNOSES IN 2018 WERE IN THE US SOUTH, DESPITE CONSTITUTING ONLY 38% OF THE POPULATION IN THE US. TEXAS IS THE SECOND MOST POPULOUS STATE IN THE US, BEHIND CALIFORNIA, WITH ABOUT 29 MILLION RESIDENTS, AND IS IN THE US SOUTH AS DEFINED BY CDC AND THE CENSUS BUREAU. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS LARGE TEXAS POPULATION, COUPLED WITH WEAKER PUBLIC HEALTH AND PREVENTION POLICIES AND FUNDING ACROSS THE US SOUTH, HAS A GROWING HIV POPULATION THAT LAGS IN CRITICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH AND RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE TO COMBAT THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE US SOUTH AND SPECIFICALLY IN TEXAS TO BOTH CONTRIBUTE TO ENDING THE US HIV EPIDEMIC AND TO LEARN HOW TO BEST DO THAT IN RESOURCE CONSTRAINED AREAS OF THE US. WE THEREFORE WILL ESTABLISH A TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH (D-CFAR) TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL MISSION OF THE NATIONAL CFAR PROGRAM BY FACILITATING HIGH-PRIORITY HIV RESEARCH AND SUPPORTING THE EFFORT TO END THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE US. THREE INSTITUTIONS HAVE COLLABORATED TO PROPOSE THIS D-CFAR: BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN HOUSTON, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER AT HOUSTON AND THE TEXAS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN SAN ANTONIO. BASED UPON THE OUTSTANDING EXPERTISE OF ITS INVESTIGATORS, THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL FOCUS ITS ACTIVITIES IN THE FIVE-YEAR FUNDING PERIOD ON THE RESEARCH THEME \u201cENDING HIV AND OPTIMIZING HIV HEALTH IN TEXAS.\u201d TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GOALS, THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL: 1) PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND FACILITATE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS THAT STRENGTHEN AND ENRICH THE D-CFAR RESEARCH AND INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT; 2) SUPPORT TARGETED HIGH-PRIORITY INTERDISCIPLINARY PILOT RESEARCH PROJECTS, ASSIST IN RESPONDING TO NEW HIV-RELATED RESEARCH INITIATIVES, AND FACILITATE RESEARCH ON ENDING HIV AND IMPROVING HEALTH OF PWH IN TEXAS; AND 3) PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART EXPERTISE, ADVICE, AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE THE RANGE OF HIV-RELATED RESEARCH FOR D-CFAR INVESTIGATORS. THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL SUPPORT AN ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, A DEVELOPMENTAL CORE, A BASIC SCIENCE CORE AND A CLINICAL AND BIOSTATISTICS CORE TO MEET INVESTIGATOR NEEDS AND CATALYZE INNOVATIVE RESEARCH. THE SCIENTIFIC CORES WILL BUILD ON OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS IN VIROLOGY, NON-HUMAN PRIMATE RESOURCES, CLINICAL TRIALS RESEARCH AND BIOSTATISTICS. THE D-CFAR WILL ENGAGE A COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ADVISORY BOARDS FOR GUIDANCE. COUPLED WITH OUTSTANDING INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, THE D- CFAR WILL STIMULATE NEW RESEARCH AND COLLABORATIONS AMONG BASIC, TRANSLATIONAL, CLINICAL, HEALTH SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS. THE D-CFAR WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO END HIV AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF PWH IN TEXAS AND SIMILAR AREAS, TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS, AND GROW INTO A FULL CFAR, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO ENDING THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN TEXAS, THE US SOUTH, AND BEYOND.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ddcd398f-5e59-e840-2368-a57b84efdc7d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_P30AI161943_7529"}, {"internal_id": 147873522, "Award ID": "P30AI152501", "Award Amount": 6215137.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-08", "CFDA Number": "93.855", "Description": "UCLA-CDU CFAR - OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: THIS APPLICATION IS A RESUBMISSION FOR A NEW CFAR THAT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN UCLA AND CDU.

THE UCLA-CDU CFAR WILL STRENGTHEN AND AMPLIFY THE IMPACT OF EXISTING RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND LAUNCH NEW PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS LOS ANGELES AND GLOBALLY THROUGH OUR FOCUS ON THREE THEMES: WE WILL STOP HIV BY PREVENTING NEW HIV INFECTIONS (PREVENTION), REDUCING MORBIDITY AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (TREATMENT) AND DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR ERADICATION (ART-FREE REMISSION). THIS GRANT WILL FUND AIDS-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY INVESTIGATORS AT UCLA, CDU AND OUR AFFILIATED INSTITUTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER IN TORRANCE; THE UCLA CARE CLINIC AND THE VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN WESTWOOD; THE UCLA VINE STREET CLINIC IN WEST HOLLYWOOD; AND THE DREW CARES, THE CDU PUSH COALITION AND THE MLK OASIS CLINIC AT CDU. THESE FACILITIES ARE AT GROUND ZERO FOR THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PERSONS LIVING WITH HIV RESIDING IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS DIRECTLY SERVED BY OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS. IN ADDITION TO THE FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS BASED IN LOS ANGELES, RESEARCHERS AT UCLA AND CDU HAVE EXTENSIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH HIV PROGRAMS AROUND THE GLOBE THAT ARE AIMED AT BUILDING GLOBAL CAPACITY. THE CFAR WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER RESEARCH AT THE INTERFACE OF COMMUNITY BY REACHING COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED AND BY BRINGING TO BEAR THE TALENT OF CDU AND UCLA RESEARCHERS TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS FROM A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE WHILE MENTORING THE NEXT GENERATION WHO BETTER REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES BEING SERVED. THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE UCLA-CDU CFAR WILL ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AIDS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES BY HARNESSING THE DIVERSE EXPERTISE IN OUR CFAR, AND BY INCLUDING LINKAGES TO COMMUNITY- BASED CLINICIAN INVESTIGATORS AND COMMUNITIES. THE ACTION PLAN FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF REQUESTED SUPPORT INCLUDES 6 CORES AND 1 SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP (SWG): THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, DEVELOPMENTAL CORE, CENTRALIZED LABORATORY SUPPORT CORE, HUMANIZED MOUSE AND GENE THERAPY CORE, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND CLINICAL INFORMATICS CORE, CLINICAL SCIENCE CORE, AND A TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN SUBSTANCE USE SWG.

TIMELY ADJUSTMENT TO THERAPY WHEN A PATIENT\u2019S TREATMENT GOALS ARE NOT MET, IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF POOR OUTCOMES IN TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2D). THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (LOW-SES) POPULATIONS, WHO OFTEN FACE BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE DISEASE SELF-MANAGEMENT AT THREE LEVELS: (1) PATIENT (E.G., LIMITED RESOURCES, LOW HEALTH LITERACY, AND LIMITED ACCESS TO CARE); (2) CLINICIAN (E.G., LACK OF TIME AND/OR POOR CULTURAL SENSITIVITY); AND (3) HEALTH SYSTEM (E.G., POOR OR ABSENT DECISION SUPPORT AND EFFECTIVE PATIENT PANEL MANAGEMENT). ONE WAY TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX CHALLENGES OF CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AT THESE THREE LEVELS IS WITH MULTI-LEVEL HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (HIT)-SUPPORTED BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS. SUCH INTERVENTIONS COMBINE CHANGES TO CLINICAL WORKFLOWS AND SELF-MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TO HELP PATIENTS TRACK DIABETES ELECTRONICALLY, TRANSMIT DATA TO CLINICIANS, AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK FOR ADJUSTING TREATMENT. CURRENTLY, MINIMAL DATA EXIST TO INFORM OPTIMAL DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND USE OF SUCH MULTI-LEVEL BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR LOW-SES POPULATIONS. MY CAREER GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENTLY FUNDED RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT HELPS DECREASE HEALTH DISPARITIES USING TECHNOLOGIES THAT SUPPORT EFFECTIVE LONG-TERM SELF-MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES. IN THIS PROJECT, I PROPOSE A 5-YEAR TRAINING AND RESEARCH PLAN FOR A MULTI-LEVEL APP-BASED INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR T2D IN LOW-SES POPULATIONS. I WILL DEVELOP AND PILOT-TEST A NURSE-LED, APP-BASED BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF THREE EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS: (1) EDUCATION ON A1C RESULTS AND GOAL SETTING VIA MYCHART, THE PATIENT PORTAL IN THE EPIC ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD; (2) A PROBLEM-SOLVING ACTION PLAN DEVELOPED BY CLINICIANS IN COLLABORATION WITH THEIR PATIENTS; AND (3) REMOTE MONITORING VIA ONTRACK, A TOP-RATED DIABETES APP, TO ANALYZE BLOOD GLUCOSE AND IDENTIFY THE NEED TO ADJUST TREATMENT. TRAINING IN POPULATION HEALTH INFORMATICS, HIT IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, HEALTH DISPARITIES, AND PRAGMATIC TRIALS WILL NOT ONLY ALLOW ME TO COMPLETE THE PROPOSED PROJECT, BUT WILL SET THE STAGE FOR EXPANDING THE CONCEPT TO OTHER DISEASES AND CLINICAL USE CASES. INDIANA UNIVERSITY AND THE REGENSTRIEF INSTITUTE, AN INFORMATICS POWERHOUSE, PLUS A STRONG TEAM OF MENTORS IN BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS, HIT IMPLEMENTATION, HEALTH DISPARITY, AND QUALITATIVE METHODS, PROVIDE AN EXCEPTIONAL SCIENTIFIC ENVIRONMENT. THE PROPOSED WORK INCLUDES: (1) TIME-TO-EVENT ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH PERSISTENT THERAPEUTIC INERTIA, USED TO GUIDE INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT AND TAILORING [AIM 1]; (2) INPUT FROM DIABETES CARE TEAM TO ADAPT THE INTERVENTION AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES TO THE CLINICAL OPERATIONS LEVEL [AIM 2]; (3) A FOCUS GROUP STUDY WITH LOW-SES PATIENTS TO HELP TAILOR THE INTERVENTION [AIM 3]; AND (4) A PILOT STUDY AT TWO CLINICS (N=60, 30 PATIENTS PER CLINIC) TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF THE INTERVENTION FOR LOW-SES PATIENTS WITH INSULIN-TREATED T2D [AIM 4].

ACP IS A PROCESS TO FACILITATE DECISION-MAKING FOR FUTURE MEDICAL CARE. BY SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS IN UNDERSTANDING AND SHARING THEIR VALUES AND GOALS, ACP CAN HELP PATIENTS MEET THEIR GOALS FOR HEALTH CARE TREATMENT, DECREASE THE EMOTIONAL BURDEN OF DECISION-MAKING FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS, AND INCREASE SATISFACTION WITH END-OF-LIFE CARE AND QUALITY OF DEATH. AVOIDANCE OF ACP CAN DELAY THE INTRODUCTION OF PALLIATIVE AND HOSPICE CARE AND RISK PATIENTS RECEIVING COSTLY AND AGGRESSIVE CARE THAT NOT ONLY IS GOAL- DISCORDANT BUT ALSO INCREASES FAMILY CAREGIVERS\u2019 ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. THE RATIONALE FOR A WEB-BASED RESILIENCE-BUILDING INTERVENTION IS THAT PATIENTS AND FAMILY CAREGIVERS CAN BE EMPOWERED TO ACCURATELY APPRAISE AND USE APPROPRIATE COPING STRATEGIES FOR ACP BY INCREASING THEIR RESILIENCE SKILLS. BUILDING RESILIENCE HAS SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS IN REDUCING CANCER DISTRESS IN ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS WITH CANCER AND THEIR PARENTS.

DISRUPTED SLEEP IN THE ICU IS THOUGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO DEVELOPMENT OF ICU DELIRIUM, HOWEVER THE SLEEP-DELIRIUM RELATIONSHIP HAS NOT BEEN RIGOROUSLY INVESTIGATED. ALTHOUGH ICU PATIENTS MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SLEEP DURATION PER 24 HOURS, SLEEP ARCHITECTURE IS SEVERELY DISRUPTED. NAMELY, THERE IS A MARKED DECREASE IN RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (REM) SLEEP COMPARED TO HEALTHY ADULTS. INSUFFICIENT REM SLEEP HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE SUCH AS DEMENTIA, WHICH HAS SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS TO ICU DELIRIUM. LESS REM SLEEP HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN PATIENTS WITH, COMPARED TO WITHOUT ICU DELIRIUM, ALTHOUGH THE TEMPORALITY IS UNCLEAR. TO DATE, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED SLEEP PRIOR TO DEVELOPMENT OF ICU DELIRIUM, AND NO STUDIES ACCOUNT FOR OBJECTIVE BASELINE SLEEP. WE PROPOSE A NOVEL APPROACH TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL GAPS BY LEVERAGING A POPULATION OF THORACIC SURGERY CANDIDATES WITH A PLANNED POST-OPERATIVE ICU ADMISSION TO ENABLE BASELINE SLEEP EVALUATION.

AS SLEEP IS NOT ROUTINELY ASSESSED IN THE ICU, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO EVALUATE SLEEP FROM MEDICAL RECORDS. THEREFORE, WE WILL FIRST IDENTIFY NON-SLEEP PREDICTORS OF ICU DELIRIUM TO THEN BE ABLE TO EVALUATE IF SLEEP INDICES MEASURED IN FUTURE STUDIES EXPLAINS A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF THE VARIANCE IN ICU DELIRIUM NOT ACCOUNTED FOR BY NON-SLEEP PREDICTORS.

THE EXACT CAUSE OF THESE DISPARATE OUTCOMES REMAINS UNKNOWN BUT MAY BE DUE TO A GREATER BURDEN OF DISTINCT STRESSORS, I.E., RACIAL, GENDER, FINANCIAL, JOB, AND SOCIAL NETWORK, EXPERIENCED BY BW REGARDLESS OF SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION (SEP), CAUSING WEATHERING AND ACCELERATED BIOLOGICAL AGING. THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY INFLUENCED STRESSORS ARE THEORIZED TO OVERRIDE THE CARDIOPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF ENDOGENOUS ESTROGEN IN BW AND MAY ALSO UNDERLIE A KEY MECHANISM LINKING STRESS TO ACCELERATION OF THE AGING PROCESS AND POOR CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IN THIS SUBGROUP. CHRONIC STRESS IS CONSIDERED A POTENT RISK FACTOR OF ACCELERATED AGING AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES, WHILE AGING IS CONSIDERED A POTENT RISK FACTOR OF CVD AND IS LINKED WITH ARTERIAL STIFFNESS, A PREDICTIVE MARKER OF SUBCLINICAL CVD AND MORTALITY RISK.

INSUFFICIENT MOM VOLUME HAS ITS ORIGINS IN LATE PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM DAYS 1-14. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF GA ON LACTATION OUTCOMES AMONG PUMP-DEPENDENT MOTHERS OF CRITICALLY ILL INFANTS ADMITTED TO THE NICU. A MAJOR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE EXISTS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MAMMARY GLAND MATURATION ON MOM VOLUME, SECRETORY ACTIVATION (SA), AND IF/HOW IT IS MEDIATED BY MOM REMOVAL (E.G., BREAST PUMP USE) DURING THE CRITICAL WINDOW (POSTPARTUM DAYS 1-14) OF TRANSITION FROM SECRETORY DIFFERENTIATION (EPITHELIAL CELL PREPARATION) TO SA (ONSET OF COPIOUS MOM VOLUME) AND AUTOCRINE CONTROL OF LACTATION (PERMANENCE OF SA) TO ENSURE CONTINUED PRODUCTION OF ADEQUATE MOM VOLUME. TO FILL THIS GAP, THIS REVISED MENTORED PATIENT-ORIENTED RESEARCH CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD (K23) PROPOSED STUDY WILL FOLLOW 188 RACIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DIVERSE MOTHERS OF INFANTS ADMITTED TO THE NICU FOR POSTPARTUM DAYS 1-14 AND ASSIGNED TO 1 OF 4 GROUPS BASED ON THE INFANT'S GA AT DELIVERY. AIM 1 WILL COMPARE MEASURES OF MOM VOLUME BETWEEN THE GA GROUPS OVER POSTPARTUM DAYS 1-14. AIM 2 WILL COMPARE MEASURES OF ONSET AND PERMANENCE OF SA USING MOM BIOMARKERS BETWEEN THE GA GROUPS. AIM 3 IS EXPLORATORY TO GAIN EVIDENCE TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIOMARKERS AND MOM VOLUME FOR THE 4 GA GROUPS.

USE OF QST TO PREDICT INPATIENT OPIOID USE AND PAIN HAS LED TO INCONSISTENT FINDINGS, BUT RECENT STUDIES HIGHLIGHT A PROMISING ROLE FOR QST TO PREDICT POSTOPERATIVE HOME OPIOID USE. SPECULATION HAS LONG FOCUSED ON GENETIC INFLUENCES AS A FACTOR IN VARIABILITY IN PAIN SENSITIVITY AND OPIOID USE. CANDIDATE GENE AND WHOLE GENOME-WIDE STUDIES HAVE PROVEN TO BE INADEQUATE TO STUDY THE COMPLEX TRAIT OF PAIN, RESULTING IN SMALL EFFECT SIZES AND LACK OF REPRODUCIBILITY. ASSESSING GENE EXPRESSION IS AN APPROACH THAT CAN BE USED TO AUGMENT THE RESEARCH ON POSTOPERATIVE PAIN. GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSES IN BLOOD HAVE IDENTIFIED CHANGES THAT CONFER VULNERABILITY FOR THE TRANSITION FROM ACUTE TO CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, LENDING SUPPORT TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION FROM PREOPERATIVE TO EARLY AND LATER POSTOPERATIVE TIME PERIODS MAY IDENTIFY EARLY MARKERS FOR THE TRANSITION TO PROLONGED POSTOPERATIVE PAIN. BY INTEGRATING GENETIC AND GENE EXPRESSION DATA, WE WILL ASSESS WHETHER ACUTE SURGICAL PAIN LEAVES SIGNATURES IN THE BLOOD THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH GENE EXPRESSION WHICH CAN INFLUENCE POSTOPERATIVE PAIN SENSITIVITY AND SUBSEQUENT OPIOID USE. OUR PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON THE TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY (TKA) POPULATION, AS THIS POPULATION DEMONSTRATES ONE OF THE HIGHEST VARIABILITIES IN POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AND OPIOID USE, AND IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE 700% WITHIN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES TO INNOVATIVELY INCORPORATE STANDARD DEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES WITH NOVEL NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL, GENETIC, AND GENE EXPRESSION DATA TO HOLISTICALLY EXAMINE THE VARIABILITY IN POSTOPERATIVE PAIN, AND ULTIMATELY OPIOID USE THROUGH THE BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL LENS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4a536007-27e4-2194-a125-f4b8c55294db-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K23NR020512_7529"}, {"internal_id": 150744876, "Award ID": "K23NR020445", "Award Amount": 332186.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-04", "CFDA Number": "93.361", "Description": "CENTERING THOSE ENGAGED IN TRANSACTIONAL SEX: A PREP INNOVATION FOR GETTING TO ZERO - GETTING TO ZERO (GTZ) NEW HIV INFECTIONS BY 2030 IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY.

HAITIANS COMPRISE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING SUBGROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE US. THESE IMMIGRANTS EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (I.E., DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, FATIGUE, AND PAIN), CONTRIBUTING TO PROGRESSIVE FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT, DISABILITY, ECONOMIC BURDEN, AND POOR LONG-TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES. KNOWLEDGE OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS EARLY IN THE POST-MIGRATION PERIOD AND LONGITUDINALLY WILL HELP INFORM TYPE AND TIMING OF INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE THE DISABLING EFFECTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THIS UNDERSERVED POPULATION. YET NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND ITS UNDERLYING BIOBEHAVIORAL, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS IN HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF RESIDENCE IN THE US OR OVER TIME. WHILE MULTIPLE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, RISING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT GUT MICROBIOME (GM) DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE VIA THE BIDIRECTIONAL MICROBIOME-GUT-BRAIN AXIS. AFTER MIGRATION, CHANGES IN GM COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY EMBODY CHANGES IN THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ([SDOH]; E.G., STRESS, SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS, DIETARY PATTERNS, ACCULTURATION, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIOCULTURAL CONDITIONS) THAT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO RISK FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. WITH MORE TIME IN THE US, THE GM OF RECENT IMMIGRANTS BECOMES MORE WESTERNIZED, WITH REDUCTIONS OF MICROBIAL PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY AND NATIVE GM SPECIES AS WELL AS GENERA-LEVEL SHIFTS IN MICROBIOTA ABUNDANCE. THE SDOH THAT DRIVE THESE GM CHANGES ARE MODIFIABLE THROUGH CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE INTERVENTIONS. THE GM THUS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SERVE AS BOTH AN EARLY INDICATOR OF RISK FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND A TOOL TO MITIGATE ITS EFFECTS. THE OVERALL GOAL FOR THIS LONGITUDINAL PILOT COHORT STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, GM COMPOSITION/DIVERSITY, AND POST-MIGRATION SDOH IN RECENT HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS TO THE US. SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO 1) CHARACTERIZE THE GM IN 60 RECENT HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS BY ANALYZING SELF-COLLECTED STOOL SAMPLES AT T1 (< 6 MONTHS IN THE US) AND T2 (6 MONTHS AFTER T1) AND DESCRIBE CHANGES IN COMPOSITION/DIVERSITY OVER TIME AND 2) EXAMINE LONGITUDINAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN POST-MIGRATION SDOH, GM COMPOSITION/DIVERSITY, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AMONG RECENT HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT, IN RECENT HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS, A) MIGRATION TO THE US IS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN GM COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY OVER TIME, AND B) CHANGES IN GM COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN POST-MIGRATION SDOH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS.

PATIENT-CENTERED COMMUNICATION (PCC) IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND IS ESSENTIAL TO HIGH-QUALITY GYNECOLOGIC CANCER CARE. HOWEVER, FEW COMMUNICATION INTERVENTIONS HAVE IMPROVED HRQOL IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER. ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS THAT MOST COMMUNICATION INTERVENTIONS HAVE LIMITED SCALABILITY. TO DATE, NO KNOWN INTERVENTION HAS AIMED TO ASSIST PATIENTS WITH OVARIAN CANCER AND THEIR CLINICIANS TO ROUTINELY ENGAGE IN PCC. WITHOUT SUCH AN INTERVENTION, THE POTENTIAL FOR PCC TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES MAY GO UNREALIZED. ANOTHER OBSTACLE TO DEVELOPING INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE PCC IS THAT OPTIMAL ASSESSMENT OF PCC INCLUDES OBJECTIVE RATINGS OF PATIENT AND CLINICIAN BEHAVIOR. INVESTIGATORS TYPICALLY RELY ON TRAINED CODERS TO IDENTIFY PCC BEHAVIORS DURING AUDIO-RECORDED CLINIC VISITS. THIS RESOURCE-INTENSIVE APPROACH LACKS FEASIBILITY FOR STUDIES WITH LARGE SAMPLES. NOVEL METHODS FOR ASSESSING PCC BEHAVIORS ARE NEEDED TO ADVANCE THE FIELD.

STUDY AIMS TO ASSESS CA IN INFANTS AND TODDLERS WITH AND WITHOUT CHD, AND TO EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION OF CA WITH NDOS AT BIRTH, 6, 9, AND 18-MONTHS OF AGE TIME POINTS. AIM #1: COMPARE CA BETWEEN CHD INFANTS AND HEALTHY CONTROLS THROUGH 4 DEVELOPMENTAL TIME POINTS. AIM #2: ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION OF CA WITH NDOS IN CHD INFANTS AND WHETHER THE ASSOCIATION OF CA WITH NDOS VARIES ACROSS DIAGNOSTIC GROUPS (CHD VS CONTROLS). METHODS THIS STUDY IS A PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL, 2-GROUP COHORT DESIGN. WE WILL ENROLL 64 INFANTS AT BIRTH [\u00b1 2 WEEKS] (32 WITH CHD AND 32 AGE- AND SEX-MATCHED HEALTHY CONTROLS TO YIELD 50 WITH COMPLETE DATA AFTER ~20% ATTRITION OVER THE 18-MONTH FOLLOW-UP).

MOREOVER, ELEVATED PERINATAL DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS ARE MORE COMMON AMONG DISADVANTAGED AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN (AAW), COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, AND AAW ARE ALMOST FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO HAVE POSTPARTUM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. FURTHER, AAW ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAVE A LBW INFANT AND 1.6 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DELIVER PRETERM, COMPARED TO NON-HISPANIC WHITE WOMEN. AS A RESULT, AAW WITH PRETERM/LBW INFANTS ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR PSYCHO-BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS, AND IMPAIRED MOTHER/INFANT BONDING. THIS CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH DISPARITY IS THE IMPETUS FOR MY LONG-TERM CAREER GOAL: TO REDUCE PSYCHO-BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS IN MINORITY MOTHERS WITH PRETERM/LBW INFANTS. MY K23 TRAINING GOALS ARE; 1) DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN EFFECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL THAT ENGAGES AND RETAINS AAW WITH PRETERM/LBW INFANTS, 2) ACQUIRE ADVANCED LABORATORY LEADERSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING, 3) OBTAIN TRAINING IN RESEARCH CLINICAL TRIAL METHODOLOGY AND ADVANCED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, 4) ACQUIRE THE SKILLS AND SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY FOR R01 FUNDING, THEREBY ACHIEVING INDEPENDENCE AS A CLINICAL INVESTIGATOR. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF MY PROPOSED STUDY IS TO EVALUATE A CULTURALLY ADAPTED MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION FOR AAW WITH PRETERM/LBW INFANTS (MAAPI) TO REDUCE MATERNAL PSYCHO- BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS AND TO IMPROVE MOTHER/INFANT BONDING. MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BENEFIT OTHER STRESSED POPULATIONS BY PROVIDING SKILLS TO REDUCE THE PSYCHO-BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE TO STRESSFUL LIFE EXPERIENCES. IN 2019 CULTURALLY ADAPTED MINDFULNESS STRATEGIES FOR AAW WERE RECOMMENDED YET FEW STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED MBSR FOR MOTHERS WITH NICU INFANTS, AND MBSR HAS NOT BEEN TAILORED FOR NOR TESTED IN AAW, WHO HAVE A NEWBORN IN THE NICU. THIS STUDY WILL ADDRESS THIS GAP, USING A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL, TO ASSESS MAAPI COMPARED TO AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM (ACTIVE COMPARISON GROUP). GUIDED BY KABAT- ZINN\u2019S MBSR PROGRAM, MAAPI WILL BE CULTURALLY ADAPTED FOR AAW, BY DRAWING UPON AAW WRITINGS/ARTISTIC EXPRESSIONS AND SPIRITUALITY, USING STORYTELLING, AND FOSTERING SELF-EMPOWERMENT TO DEVELOP MINDFULNESS SKILLS. MAAPI WILL BE DELIVERED USING A HYBRID FORMAT (FIVE VIRTUAL ZOOM SESSIONS AND THREE FACE-TO-FACE SESSIONS) TO MEET CONSTRAINTS OF NEW MOTHERS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1) DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH MAAPI IMPROVES PSYCHO-BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS AND MOTHER/INFANT BONDING OF AAW WITH PRETERM/LBW INFANTS, 2) EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF MAAPI ON PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AND OXYTOCIN. PRIOR WORK DEMONSTRATES STRESS TO INCREASE PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, BUT TO DECREASE OXYTOCIN LEVELS. RESTORING BALANCE OF THESE BIOMARKERS MAY BE A BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM WHEREBY MAAPI REDUCES MATERNAL PSYCHO-BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS AND IMPROVES MOTHER/INFANT BONDING.

ESTIMATIONS CURRENTLY RELY ON ULTRASOUND-DERIVED MEASUREMENTS OF SPECIFIC FETAL PLANES TO INDIRECTLY ASSESS GROWTH AND WELLBEING. THE STANDARD FETAL BIOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF FETAL WEIGHT (BIPARIETAL DIAMETER, HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE, ABDOMINAL CIRCUMFERENCE AND FEMUR LENGTH) ARE POORLY CORRELATED TO ACTUAL FETAL WEIGHT, DEFINED AS THE MEASUREMENT OF NEWBORN WEIGHT IN GRAMS AT BIRTH. FOR NEWBORNS WHO ARE ABOVE 4,000 GRAMS AT BIRTH, CURRENT ERROR ESTIMATES OF FETAL WEIGHT IN THE LATE-THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY ARE ONLY ACCURATE APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE TIME. BY NO LONGER RELYING ON FETAL BIOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS, DATA SCIENCE APPROACHES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ESTIMATE FETAL WEIGHT WITH LOWER BIAS AND ERRORS COMPARED TO STANDARD REGRESSION METHODS. TO DATE, NO STUDIES HAVE USED ULTRASOUND IMAGES, NOT JUST THE FETAL MEASUREMENTS, AS INPUT INTO A NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH TO ESTIMATE FETAL WEIGHT.

HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM OF SUCH BLACK-WHITE DIFFERENCES IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. EVEN EXTENSIVE BIOMEDICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND SOCIO- DEMOGRAPHIC RISK FACTORS CAN EXPLAIN ONLY ABOUT HALF OF PTB INCIDENCE. CHRONIC STRESS HAS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION AS A ROBUST PREDICTOR OF PTB, PARTICULARLY AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS. NEVERTHELESS, LITERATURE SHOWS INCONSISTENT EVIDENCE ON THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG RACE/ETHNICITY, CHRONIC STRESS, AND PTB, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES INVOLVED IN ASSESSING WOMEN\u2019S CHRONIC STRESS EXPOSURES. ACCURATE CHRONIC STRESS MEASURES SHOULD CAPTURE THE NATURE OF STRESSORS: CUMULATIVE, INTERACTIVE, AND POPULATION-SPECIFIC. IN THIS REGARD, CONVENTIONAL STATISTICAL MODELS (E.G., LINEAR REGRESSION) HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO MODEL CHRONIC STRESS EXPOSURES WITH HIGH PRECISION. THUS, THIS STUDY WILL ADOPT MACHINE LEARNING (ML), A STATE-OF-THE-ART MODELING TECHNIQUE, TO COMPUTE NON-LINEAR AND SYNERGISTIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CHRONIC STRESSORS, DETECT UNKNOWN PATTERNS, AND REFLECT SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN CHRONIC STRESSORS BETWEEN N-H WHITE AND N-H BLACK WOMEN FOR MORE ACCURATE PREDICTION OF THEIR PTB RISK.

POTENTIALLY IATROGENIC, COMPLICATION OF PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (PICU) CARE AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR CLINICAL OUTCOMES. POOR SLEEP QUALITY DURING CRITICAL ILLNESS IS A PROPOSED CAUSE OF DELIRIUM. UPON ADMISSION, CHILDREN EXPERIENCE A CHAOTIC PICU ENVIRONMENT THAT DISRUPTS SLEEP/WAKE PATTERNS, INCLUDING LACK OF DAY/NIGHT LIGHT AND SOUND CYCLING AND FREQUENT EXAMINATIONS AND PROCEDURES. THIS PICU CARE MODEL IS NEITHER CHILD- NOR FAMILY-CENTERED AND LIKELY DISRUPTS SLEEP HEALTH. GOOD SLEEP HEALTH REQUIRES REGULARITY IN SLEEP/WAKE PATTERNS WITH APPROPRIATE SLEEP TIMING, HIGH SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND ADEQUATE SLEEP DURATION TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH TRAINING PLAN (R2-PD) IS TO USE EXISTING DATA TO EXPLORE ASSOCIATIONS AMONG SLEEP HEALTH (I.E., TIMING, EFFICIENCY, DURATION, REGULARITY), SLEEP BIOLOGY (I.E., MELATONIN DYSREGULATION), AND PEDIATRIC DELIRIUM. THE DATA ARE FROM RESTORE RESILIENCE (R2; R21HD093369), A 2-CENTER, PROSPECTIVE COHORT TRIAL OF A NURSE-DRIVEN CARE BUNDLE DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN SLEEP/WAKE RHYTHMS IN 54 CHILDREN (6 M.O.-17 Y.O.) WITH ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE ON MECHANICAL VENTILATION. SPECIFIC AIMS OF R2-PD INCLUDE: (1) EXAMINE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP HEALTH (I.E., DAYTIME ACTIVITY RATIO ESTIMATE [TIMING], SLEEP EPISODE DURATION, TOTAL SLEEP TIME [DURATION], SLEEP EFFICIENCY) AND PEDIATRIC DELIRIUM (I.E., INCIDENCE, DURATION). (2) DETERMINE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN IMPLEMENTATION OF A NURSE-DRIVEN CARE BUNDLE THAT PROMOTES SLEEP/WAKE CYCLE REGULARITY AND PEDIATRIC DELIRIUM (I.E., INCIDENCE, DURATION). (EXPLORATORY) EXPLORE DIFFERENCES IN SALIVARY MELATONIN LEVELS (I.E., MESOR, AMPLITUDE, ACROPHASE) OVER TIME (I.E., STUDY DAYS 2 AND 5) IN CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN WITH AND WITHOUT DELIRIUM. THIS STUDY WILL BE AMONG THE FIRST TO EXPLORE LINKS AMONG SLEEP DISRUPTION, MELATONIN LEVELS, AND DELIRIUM IN A SIZEABLE CRITICALLY ILL PEDIATRIC COHORT FOLLOWED FOR 9.8 (SD=7.7) DAYS. COMBINED WITH IN-DEPTH TRAINING IN MULTI-SITE CLINICAL TRIAL CONDUCT WITH DR. MARTHA CURLEY (SPONSOR) AND PEDIATRIC SLEEP HEALTH WITH DR. MONICA ORDWAY (MENTOR), THE R2-PD ANALYSIS WILL PROVIDE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR FUTURE, LARGE-SCALE NURSE-LED CLINICAL TRIALS OF INDIVIDUALIZED SLEEP-PROMOTING INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT PEDIATRIC DELIRIUM. TRAINING GOALS FOR THE 18-MONTH POST-DOCTORAL PERIOD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA INCLUDE: (1) EXPAND KNOWLEDGE OF PEDIATRIC SLEEP HEALTH AS A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CONSTRUCT AND UNDERSTAND HOW SLEEP HEALTH RELATES TO PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE AND DELIRIUM. (2) RECEIVE ADVANCED TRAINING IN MULTI-SITE CLINICAL TRIAL CONDUCT AND DATA COORDINATION. (3) ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF PEDIATRIC CRITICAL ILLNESS THROUGH RESEARCH DISSEMINATION. (4) DEVELOP PROFESSIONALLY IN PREPARATION FOR CAREER AS AN INDEPENDENT PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE RESEARCHER. THIS APPLICATION ALIGNS WITH NINR INTEREST IN TRAINING NURSE SCIENTISTS IN INTERVENTION RESEARCH WITH PICU NURSING PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS (NOT-NR-21-001).

OVERALL, BLACK WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE OBESE (BODY MASS INDEX [BMI] =30 KG/M2), AT RISK FOR NOT GAINING OPTIMAL WEIGHT DURING PREGNANCY, AND DELIVERING AN INFANT OF LOWER BIRTHWEIGHT COMPARED WITH NON- HISPANIC WHITE AND HISPANIC WOMEN. BLACK WOMEN ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO RESIDE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE (E.G., POVERTY), DISORDER (E.G., VACANT HOUSING) AND CRIME, AND HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO SUPERMARKETS AND HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS COMPARED WITH WHITES. NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS (SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE, DISORDER, CRIME, LIMITED FOOD ACCESSIBILITY) MAY INCREASE THE RISK FOR EITHER INADEQUATE OR EXCESSIVE GWG AND LOWER INFANT BIRTHWEIGHT. HOWEVER, EXISTING DATA SHOW INCONCLUSIVE ASSOCIATIONS OF NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS WITH INADEQUATE OR EXCESSIVE GWG AND INFANT BIRTHWEIGHT. DATA FROM 620 PREGNANT BLACK WOMEN ENROLLED IN THE NIH R01 STUDY SOCIAL STRESSORS AND INFLAMMATION: A MIXED METHODS APPROACH TO PRETERM BIRTH (R01MD011575; PI GIURGESCU, CO-I MISRA) PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL BE ANALYZED. WOMEN COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AND HAD BLOOD DRAWN AT 19-29 WEEKS GESTATION. NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WERE MEASURED BY MATERNAL QUESTIONNAIRES AND ADMINISTRATIVE (E.G., CENSUS) DATA. SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION WAS ASSESSED BY PLASMA LEVELS OF CYTOKINES (INTERLEUKIN [IL]-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR [TNF-A], INTERFERON GAMMA [IFN-]) AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN [CRP]. GWG AND BIRTH DATA WILL BE OBTAINED FROM MEDICAL RECORDS. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO: 1) DETERMINE THE PATHWAYS BY WHICH NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS RELATE TO GWG; AND 2) DETERMINE THE PATHWAYS BY WHICH NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS RELATE TO INFANT BIRTHWEIGHT. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP OF PERCEIVED AND OBJECTIVELY MEASURED NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS WITH GWG IN A LARGE COHORT OF PREGNANT BLACK WOMEN. NEIGHBORHOOD ACCESS TO HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY FOOD STORES WILL BE EXAMINED AS A HEALTH DETERMINANT TO GWG.

METABOLIC SYNDROME IS A CLUSTER OF RISK FACTORS INCLUDING CENTRAL OBESITY, DYSLIPIDEMIA, HYPERTENSION, AND INSULIN RESISTANCE WITH A RANGE OF SECONDARY SEQUELAE SUCH AS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD), CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE, AND DIABETES. METABOLIC SYNDROME HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST WORLD HEALTH CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THERE ARE EMERGING DATA THAT THE GUT MICROBIOTA HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME AND DIRECTLY INFLUENCES HOST PHENOTYPES. A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS UNDERLYING METABOLIC SYNDROME WILL BE USEFUL IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE PREVENTION STRATEGIES AND APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FOR AT RISK INDIVIDUALS. IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GUT MICROBIOME AND METABOLIC SYNDROME TRAITS, WE WILL PERFORM A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE METABOLIC SYNDROME IN MEN (METSIM) STUDY. THIS IS A POPULATION-BASED COHORT OF 10,197 MEN AGED 45-73 YEARS, RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THE POPULATION REGISTER OF KUOPIO, EASTERN FINLAND, FROM 2005 TO 2010. THIS POPULATION HAS BEEN UNIQUELY CHARACTERIZED FOR CARDIOVASCULAR CLINICAL TRAITS SUCH AS CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, STROKE, HEART FAILURE, AND METABOLIC SYNDROME TRAITS. THIS PROPOSAL EXTENDS THE IMPACT OF THE PARENT STUDY, WHICH AIMED TO INVESTIGATE NONGENETIC AND GENETIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME AND CVD IN BOTH CROSS SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS. WE WILL ANALYZE A SUBSET OF APPROXIMATELY 1000 SUBJECTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A 7-YEAR FOLLOW-UP. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT GUT MICROBES CONTRIBUTE TO METABOLIC SYNDROME TRAITS IN PART THROUGH THEIR METABOLITES AND THEIR METABOLITES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. WE WILL FIRST DETERMINE THE GUT DERIVED METABOLITES THAT HAVE ASSOCIATION WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME TRAITS. ONCE WE IDENTIFY THE SUBSET OF METABOLITES, WE WILL IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL AND CLUSTERS OF MICROBES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE LEVELS OF CERTAIN PLASMA METABOLITES. WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF THE GUT MICROBE-GENERATED METABOLITE WITH MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. DATA WILL BE ANALYZED USING LASSO REGRESSION, LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS, PATH ANALYSIS, AND COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION.

HOSPITAL QUALITY AND A LACK OF GUIDELINE-CONCORDANT CARE (E.G., INSULIN INFUSIONS, TIMELY ANTIBIOTICS) ARE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS; HOWEVER, A LARGE FRACTION OF THIS RACIAL DISPARITY REMAINS UNEXPLAINED. SLEEP, CIRCADIAN RHYTHM DISRUPTION, AND IMPAIRED GLUCOREGULATION MAY PLAY A ROLE IN POST-CABG/VR HEALTH DISPARITIES IN NON-HISPANIC BLACK AMERICANS. THESE DISRUPTIONS MAY RESULT IN PROLONGED LENGTH OF STAY, POSTOPERATIVE CONVALESCENCE, IMPAIRED IMMUNE FUNCTION, AND CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS DESCRIPTIVE STUDY IS TO EXAMINE SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM CHARACTERISTICS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SLEEP, CIRCADIAN RHYTHM, AND GLUCOREGULATION AMONG ADULTS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT POSTOPERATIVE CABG/VR SURGERY. IN AIM 1, WE WILL DETERMINE BETWEEN- AND WITHIN-PERSON ASSOCIATIONS OF SLEEP, CIRCADIAN RHYTHM AND GLUCOREGULATION ASSOCIATIONS AMONG 30 ADULTS POST-CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT WITH OR WITHOUT VALVULAR SURGERY (50% NON-HISPANIC BLACK AND 50% NON- HISPANIC WHITE). SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN CHARACTERISTICS WILL BE DESCRIBED THROUGH THE TIMING OF BEHAVIORAL (ACTIGRAPHY) MEASURES. IN AIM 2, WE WILL COMPARE SLEEP, CIRCADIAN RHYTHM CHARACTERISTICS, AND GLUCOREGULATION BETWEEN 15 INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFYING AS NON-HISPANIC BLACK TO 15 INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFYING AS NON-HISPANIC WHITE POST-CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT WITH OR WITHOUT VALVULAR SURGERY. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT HIGHER SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POORER GLUCOREGULATION AND THAT THERE ARE SLEEP, CIRCADIAN, AND GLUCOREGULATION RACIAL DISPARITIES AMONG INDIVIDUALS POST-CABG/VR. THE PROPOSED F31 STUDY AND TRAINING PLAN WILL PROVIDE A STRONG FOUNDATION IN SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM HEALTH DISPARITIES. PROMOTING SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM STABILITY POST-SURGERY THROUGH BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATIONS MAY IMPROVE GLUCOREGULATION BY REDUCING INSULIN RESISTANCE, IMPROVING INSULIN SENSITIVITY, AND OTHER SHORT- AND LONG-TERM POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES IN A POPULATION WHERE SUCH CLINICAL GAINS MAY OTHERWISE BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ON A NOVEL POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTOR TO RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CORONARY ARTERY POST-OPERATIVE OUTCOMES IN THE ICU WHERE IT IS CRITICAL TO OPTIMIZE GLUCOREGULATION.

HEALTHY CHILD DEVELOPMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO LONG-TERM WELLNESS BECAUSE IT ENABLES HUMAN CAPACITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CIVIC LIFE; HOWEVER, NOT ALL CHILDREN EXPERIENCE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. MANY CHILDREN ARE AFFECTED BY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) INCLUDING STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES RESULTING FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENT. NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENT, A POWERFUL SDOH, PROFOUNDLY SHAPES CHILDREN'S PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH, AND INFLUENCES OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM HEALTH. PARENTS WHO RESIDE IN POORER NEIGHBORHOODS ALSO TEND TO EXPERIENCE INEFFECTIVE COPING, PARENTING CHALLENGES, AND SUBOPTIMAL FAMILY COHESION, WHICH MAY INFLUENCE BEHAVIORAL DYSREGULATION AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD. BEHAVIORAL DYSREGULATION \u2013 AN IMPAIRMENT IN ABILITY TO SELF-REGULATE BEHAVIORS CHARACTERIZED BY REFLEXIVE, AUTOMATIC, AND EMOTIONAL REACTION OF ACTING OUT \u2013 IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMON CHILDHOOD PSYCHOPATHOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, BEHAVIORAL DYSREGULATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, ANOTHER IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF LONG-TERM CHILD HEALTH. STUDYING THESE OUTCOMES IN EARLY CHILDHOOD PROVIDES WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO PROMOTE LIFE-LONG HEALTH AND CLOSE THE GAP ON HEALTH DISPARITIES LATER IN LIFE. PARENTING BEHAVIOR AND FAMILY COHESION (POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE LEVEL OF CLOSENESS, EMOTIONAL BONDING, AND SUPPORT) ARE MODIFIABLE INDICATORS OF FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS THAT CAN BE TARGETED TO MITIGATE THE EFFECT OF NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENT ON CHILD BEHAVIORAL DYSREGULATION.

WHILE THERE IS A LARGE CORPUS OF KNOWLEDGE ASSOCIATING SDOH WITH CHILDHOOD ASTHMA, A GAP EXISTS ON SCREENING OF SDOH IN SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CENTERS (SBHCS). SBHCS CARE FOR CHILDREN PRE-KINDERGARTEN TO 18 YEARS OF AGE, WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE SCHOOL NURSE TO ADVANCE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF ALL YOUTH. ALTHOUGH SBHCS HAVE ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHILD, SBHC PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE EASY ACCESS TO SDOH INFORMATION AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY LEVEL. SCREENING PEDIATRIC FAMILIES FOR SDOH IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY CAN FACILITATE CONNECTION TO PERTINENT RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THERE IS A DEARTH OF INFORMATION REGARDING SDOH SCREENING AND THE ROLE OF SBHCS IN PEDIATRIC SDOH INTERVENTIONS. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON THE CRITICAL NEED TO IDENTIFY THE FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS OF SDOH INFORMATION GATHERING BEHAVIORS IN SBHCS. THROUGH AN EXPLORATORY SEQUENTIAL DESIGN, THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INFORMATICS RESOURCE PROVIDING SDOH INFORMATION TO SBHC PROVIDERS. ASTHMA WILL SERVE AS THE FIRST CLINICAL CONDITION FOR THIS NOVEL WORK. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL ADDRESS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1. DESCRIBE THE INFORMATION GATHERING BEHAVIORS FOR SDOH AND ASTHMA PERFORMED BY SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH PROVIDERS (I.E., NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIANS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS) FOR PREVENTATIVE ASTHMA CARE, AND WHAT BARRIERS EXIST FOR INFORMATION GATHERING. AIM 2. DEVELOP AND EVALUATE AN INFORMATICS RESOURCE THAT PROVIDES ACTIONABLE SDOH INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PREVENTATIVE MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA. AIM 3: EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF AN INFORMATICS RESOURCE COMPRISING SDOH AMONG SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH PROVIDERS FOR USE IN THE PREVENTATIVE MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA.

A HIGHLY DISABLING ASPECT OF SPINA BIFIDA IS NEUROGENIC BOWEL DYSFUNCTION, WHICH REQUIRES LIFELONG SELF-MANAGEMENT (SM) INDEPENDENTLY OR TOGETHER WITH A CAREGIVER. BOWEL SM IN ADULTS WITH SB IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINED FECAL CONTINENCE.

THE STUDY IS COMPRISED OF THREE PARTS: (1) MEASURE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXPERIENCING AN SMM OUTCOME AND EXPERIENCES OF DISCRIMINATION AND RESPECTFUL CARE; (2) ANALYZE SURVEY DATA AND PURPOSIVELY RECRUIT A SAMPLE FOR QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS; (3) CONDUCT 15-20 INTERVIEWS OF BIRTHING PEOPLE IDENTIFIED BY LOW SCORES ON THE RESPECT SCALE (INDICATING LOW RESPECT) AND HIGH SCORES ON THE DISCRIMINATION SCALE (INDICATING A HIGH LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION). IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ON BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC INTERPERSONAL RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND MATERNAL DISRESPECT IN BLACK BIRTHING PEOPLE EXPERIENCING SMM OUTCOMES, A POPULATION AT HIGH RISK FOR HEALTH INEQUITIES. IMPORTANTLY, WE WILL MEASURE DISCRIMINATION AND DISRESPECTFUL CARE RECEIVED FROM ALL PROVIDER TYPES, INCLUDING MIDWIVES AND NURSES, THE LATTER OF WHO HAS BEEN OMITTED FROM PREVIOUS HEALTH INEQUITIES RESEARCH.

ANNUALLY 3.8 MILLION WOMEN GIVE BIRTH IN THE UNITED STATES (US). MANY POSTPARTUM MOTHERS EXPERIENCE AN ARRAY OF POSTPARTUM SYMPTOMS, SUCH AS SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, WHICH HAVE BEEN LINKED TO POSTPARTUM WEIGHT RETENTION AND LONG-TERM WEIGHT GAIN, INCREASING THE CARDIOVASCULAR RISKS OVER THE LIFE COURSE. THUS, POSTPARTUM SYMPTOMS AND THEIR EFFECTS IMPACT MOTHERS\u2019 OVERALL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. POSTPARTUM SYMPTOMS OFTEN CO-OCCUR AND ARE CORRELATED TO EACH OTHER, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS SYMPTOM CLUSTERS. COMPARED TO AN INDIVIDUALLY MANIFESTED SYMPTOM, SYMPTOM CLUSTERS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AND CONTRIBUTE TO WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON EITHER INDIVIDUAL SYMPTOM SEVERITY OR OCCURRENCE, WHICH LIMITS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW POSTPARTUM SYMPTOM CLUSTERS MANIFEST AND IMPACT HEALTH. IN ADDITION, A LACK OF RACIAL-ETHNIC DIVERSITY IN PRIOR RESEARCH CREATES A CRITICAL GAP IN UNDERSTANDING THE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN US MATERNAL HEALTH. THIS STUDY WILL USE DATA FROM A FEDERALLY-FUNDED STUDY, COMMUNITY CHILD HEALTH NETWORK, AND WILL INCLUDE 940 BLACK AND 408 HISPANIC MOTHERS (76% OF THE SAMPLE). THE AIMS ARE TO: AIM 1. IDENTIFY SUBGROUPS OF MOTHERS WITH DIFFERENT SYMPTOM PROFILES AT 6 MONTHS POSTPARTUM USING LATENT PROFILE ANALYSIS. THIS APPROACH WILL ALLOW IDENTIFYING SUBGROUPS OF MOTHERS WHO SHARE SIMILAR SYMPTOM SEVERITY EXPERIENCES (PROFILE) AND THOSE WHO ARE AT-RISK FOR WORSE SYMPTOM EXPERIENCES SO THAT PERSONALIZED INTERVENTIONS CAN BE DEVELOPED. AIM 2. EXAMINE INDIVIDUAL-, RELATIONSHIP-, AND COMMUNITY-LEVEL SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SYMPTOM PROFILE. THIS WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHICH SDOH INFLUENCE POSTPARTUM SYMPTOM PROFILES. AIM 3. EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ALLOSTATIC LOAD AND EACH SYMPTOM PROFILE. ALLOSTATIC LOAD IS A MARKER OF CUMULATIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL WEAR AND TEAR THAT HAS A SUBSEQUENT IMPACT ON CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC HEALTH (E.G., OBESITY), WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY.

INDEED, ABOUT 50% OF NH RESIDENTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS DUE TO SUSPECTED INFECTIONS, AND UP TO 55% OF THESE HOSPITALIZATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE. FURTHERMORE, BLACK AND HISPANIC RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE SUBOPTIMAL PALLIATIVE CARE AND HAVE HIGHER RATES OF HOSPITALIZATIONS DUE TO INFECTIONS COMPARED TO NON-HISPANIC AND WHITE RESIDENTS.

ACROSS CF CARE CENTERS, TRANSITION PREPARATION PRACTICES ARE NOT STANDARDIZED AND POOR OUTCOMES SUCH AS GAPS IN RECOMMENDED CARE AND SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL DETERIORATION STILL OCCUR. THIS LACK OF STANDARDIZATION IS IN PART DUE TO INSUFFICIENT EVALUATION OF THE OUTCOMES OF CURRENT TRANSITION PREPARATION PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A GAP IN THE QUALITATIVE LITERATURE ON AYA AND PARENT PERSPECTIVES OF HEALTHCARE TRANSITION IN THE UNITED STATES. FILLING THESE GAPS WOULD HELP TO PROMOTE THE CREATION OF STANDARDIZED, EVIDENCE BASED AND AYA AND FAMILY CENTERED TRANSITION PROGRAMS THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY IMPROVE HEALTHCARE TRANSITION OUTCOMES FOR AYAS WITH CF. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO EVALUATE THE POST-TRANSITION OUTCOMES OF A CURRENT TRANSITION PREPARATION PROGRAM FOR AYAS WITH CF AND TO EXPLORE ADOLESCENTS WITH CF AND PARENT EXPECTATIONS AND PERCEPTIONS OF HEALTHCARE TRANSITION. THIS STUDY ALIGNS WITH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH PRIORITY AREA OF SELF-MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THIS STUDY ALIGNS WITH THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 GOAL TO \u201cIMPROVE THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT, HEALTH, SAFETY, AND WELL-BEING OF ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS\u201d. ULTIMATELY THIS STUDY WILL HELP TO PROMOTE SUCCESSFUL, INDEPENDENT ILLNESS SELF-MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVE THE TRANSITION PREPARATION PROCESS FOR AYAS WITH CF. THE EXPANDED SOCIOECOLOGICAL MODEL FOR ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULT READINESS FOR TRANSITION WILL BE USED TO GUIDE THIS MIXED- METHODS STUDY. THIS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A HOLISTIC VIEW OF HEALTHCARE TRANSITION BY ADDRESSING THE MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE TRANSITION READINESS AND POST-TRANSITION OUTCOMES. FOR THE QUANTITATIVE AIM OF THIS STUDY WE WILL EXAMINE BIOMEDICAL OUTCOMES (LUNG FUNCTION AND NUTRITION STATUS) AND BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES (CONTINUITY OF RECOMMENDED OUTPATIENT CARE AND ENGAGEMENT IN CARE) COMPARING AYAS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A STRUCTURED TRANSITION PREPARATION PROGRAM COMPARED TO THOSE WHO DID NOT AT A LARGE, URBAN, ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER. WE WILL USE DATA FROM THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS FOUNDATION PATIENT REGISTRY AND CF R.I.S.E. TRANSITION PROGRAM PARTICIPATION RECORDS TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM. THE QUALITATIVE AIM WILL BE ACHIEVED THOUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 15 ADOLESCENTS WITH CF/PARENT DYADS. THIS STUDY WILL BE SUPPORTED BY A STRONG MENTORSHIP TEAM AND WILL BENEFIT FROM THE MANY RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF NURSING. AN ESTABLISHED COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH 2 CF CARE CENTERS (1 ADULT, 1 PEDIATRIC) WILL FACILITATE RECRUITMENT AND DATA ACCESS.

ONE SUCH SYMPTOM IS CHRONIC PAIN, WHICH IS TWICE AS PREVALENT IN CANCER SURVIVORS THAN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), LOWER TREATMENT ADHERENCE TO CANCER SURVEILLANCE, AND CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION. ALTHOUGH THERE IS INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE MAGNITUDE AND RAMIFICATION OF CHRONIC CANCER PAIN, WHAT IS NOT KNOWN ARE THE UNIQUE CANCER-SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHRONIC-CANCER PAIN EXPERIENCE. BIOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL (BPS) FACTORS HEAVILY INFLUENCE CHRONIC PAIN IN NON-CANCER POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, CANCER PAIN HAS TYPICALLY BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CHRONIC PAIN STUDIES, AND AS SUCH, MULTIMODAL TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS ARE LACKING. DUE TO A LACK OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS, CHRONIC CANCER PAIN MANAGEMENT RELIES ON A BIOMEDICAL MODEL WITH OPIOID MANAGEMENT BEING THE CORNERSTONE OF TREATMENT. AS A CONSEQUENCE AND DESPITE LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS PRACTICE, CANCER SURVIVORS ARE PRESCRIBED LONG-TERM OPIOID THERAPY AT FIVE TIMES THE RATE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT CONTINUE TO REPORT UNDERTREATED PAIN. ALTHOUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT HAVE SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, THESE HAVE NOT BEEN ADAPTED TO CANCER SURVIVORS WHO LIKELY HAVE A UNIQUE CHRONIC PAIN EXPERIENCE, DUE TO CANCER-SPECIFIC FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FEAR OF RECURRENCE AND CANCER-RELATED DISTRESS.

HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE ROLE OF REWARD RESPONSIVITY TO LOSS AND CAREGIVING BEHAVIORS. EVEN FEWER STUDIES HAVE ASKED WOMEN TO DESCRIBE THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH GOAL PURSUIT DURING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD AND PERCEIVED FUNCTIONAL ABILITY AS A MOTHER.

DESPITE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT EARLY INTEGRATION OF PALLIATIVE CARE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSES THESE COMPLEX NEEDS AMONG HF PATIENTS, IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE, AND DECREASES HOSPITALIZATIONS, LESS THAN 10% OF THE SIX MILLION PATIENTS WITH HF RECEIVE PALLIATIVE CARE.

PALLIATIVE CARE SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO TRADITIONAL HF CARE BASED ON PATIENTS\u2019 PERCEIVED NEEDS IN ANY OF THE EIGHT DOMAINS OF PALLIATIVE CARE WHICH INCLUDE PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, SPIRITUAL, CULTURAL, ETHICAL/LEGAL, END OF LIFE, AND CARE COORDINATION NEEDS. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE UNMET PALLIATIVE CARE NEEDS OF PATIENTS WITH HF, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE PHYSICALLY FRAIL. BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY HALF OF ALL PATIENTS WITH HF ARE PHYSICALLY FRAIL, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE UNMET PALLIATIVE CARE NEEDS OF PHYSICALLY FRAIL PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED HF. FURTHER, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW HIGHER UNMET PALLIATIVE CARE NEEDS AND PHYSICAL FRAILTY MAY INTERACT TO CONTRIBUTE TO WORSE QUALITY OF LIFE AND INCREASED ODDS OF HOSPITALIZATIONS/MORTALITY.

PERSONS WITH IHD SUFFERING FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, INCLUDING HOPELESSNESS, ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM IHD. FOLLOWING A STRESSFUL EVENT, THE VAGUS NERVE ENABLES ACTIVATION OF EITHER A SYMPATHETIC (FIGHT/FLIGHT) OR PARASYMPATHETIC (REST/DIGEST) RESPONSE. HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), THE BEAT-TO-BEAT VARIABILITY BETWEEN NORMAL SUCCESSIVE HEART BEATS, IS A BIOMARKER OF BOTH ADAPTIVE AND MALADAPTIVE REACTIONS TO STRESS. DECREASED HRV PREDICTS GREATER RISK FOR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES IN PERSONS WITH IHD. AS STATED BY POLYVAGAL THEORY, HRV MAY BE INFLUENCED BY SOCIAL SUPPORT. DECREASED PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT (PSS), A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, IS PREDICTIVE OF INCREASED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN PERSONS WITH IHD. DECREASED PSS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HOPELESSNESS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER, BUT THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN IHD BEYOND THE APPLICANT\u2019S SMALL PILOT STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH HOPELESSNESS.

WILDFIRES ARE INCREASING IN INTENSITY, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY. THEY ARE MOVING BEYOND WILDLAND BORDERS AND INTO HIGHLY POPULATED AREAS, WHICH MEANS MORE PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED. IT ALSO MEANS THAT PARTICULATE MATTER (PM) FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE IS COMBINED WITH OTHER POLLUTANTS FROM URBAN AREAS AND INTENSIFYING POOR AIR QUALITY. THE MOTHER-FETAL DYAD IS PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO TOXICANTS AND AMBIENT OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION. EVIDENCE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT FINE PM CROSSES THE BLOOD- PLACENTA BARRIER AND INTO FETAL CIRCULATION. TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH OF IN UTERO WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE, WE AIM TO: 1): ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IN UTERO WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. HYPOTHESIS 1A: THERE WILL BE A DECREASE IN GESTATIONAL AGE AT BIRTH AFTER IN UTERO EXPOSURE TO WILDFIRE SMOKE. HYPOTHESIS 1B: THERE WILL BE A DECREASE IN BIRTH WEIGHT AFTER IN UTERO EXPOSURE TO WILDFIRE SMOKE; 2). EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IN UTERO WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STABILITY AND CLINICAL PRESENTATION AT BIRTH. HYPOTHESIS 2A: THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENCE IN NEONATAL APGAR SCORES AT 1 MINUTE OF LIFE AFTER IN UTERO WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE. HYPOTHESIS 2B. THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENCE IN APGAR SCORES AT 5 MINUTES OF LIFE AFTER IN UTERO WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE. 3). EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IN UTERO WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE AND REQUIREMENTS OF NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE AT BIRTH. HYPOTHESIS: THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN NICU ADMISSIONS AT BIRTH AFTER IN UTERO WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE. THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF DATA AVAILABLE FROM THREE SOURCES USED TO CONDUCT A POPULATION-BASED RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY IN WASHINGTON STATE. THE THREE DATA SOURCES INCLUDE: 1. AIR QUALITY DATA FROM THE WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY LABORATORY FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH, 2. A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) THAT OVERLAYS COORDINATES FOR LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE OF PHYSICAL ADDRESSES WITH THE AIR QUALITY DATA AND OTHER SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE MOTHERS RESIDED AND 3. MATERNAL HEALTH AND NEONATAL BIRTH OUTCOMES DATA AVAILABLE FROM THE WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. DURING THE TIME PERIOD OF INTEREST (2010 TO 2016) THERE WERE 611,182 BIRTHS TO MOTHERS WITH A PHYSICAL ADDRESS IN WA. FOR EACH OF THE THREE AIMS, A GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELING (GLMM) FRAMEWORK WILL BE USED TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN POOR BIRTH OUTCOMES AND EXPOSURE TO PM2.5 WHILE CONTROLLING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDING VARIABLES. A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM WITH EXPERTISE IN NURSING, AIR QUALITY, SPATIAL ANALYSIS, AND BIOSTATISTICS WILL SUPPORT THIS WORK. CONDUCTING THIS RESEARCH WILL BUILD ON MY EXPERIENCE AS NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE NURSE AND SUPPORT A STRONG FOUNDATION IN MY CAREER AS A NURSE SCIENTIST WITH A FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE IN THE MATERNAL CHILD POPULATION.

IN THE LAST TWO DECADES, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY NH RESIDENTS AND A DECREASE IN NON-LATINO WHITE NH RESIDENTS. RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES OFTEN RESIDE IN NHS SITUATED IN LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE POORLY RESOURCED AND PROVIDE LOW QUALITY OF CARE. COVID-19 HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE INCREASED VULNERABILITY OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY NH RESIDENTS. PRIOR TO COVID-19, AN ESTIMATED 25% OF ALL DEATHS IN THE US OCCURRED IN NHS AND APPROXIMATELY 44% OF NON-HOSPICE NH RESIDENTS EXPERIENCED HOSPITALIZATIONS DURING THE LAST 30 DAYS OF LIFE. RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY NH RESIDENTS EXPERIENCE INCREASED HOSPITALIZATIONS COMPARED TO NON-LATINO WHITE NH RESIDENTS. MANY OF THESE HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE. PALLIATIVE CARE IS ESSENTIAL IN PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY END-OF-LIFE CARE BY ALLEVIATING SYMPTOMS AND PROVIDING SUPPORT TO PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS; YET, PALLIATIVE CARE IS SUBOPTIMAL IN MANY NHS. IN PRELIMINARY WORK USING 2017 DATA FROM THE RANDOMLY SAMPLED, NATIONAL, STRATIFIED SURVEY (N = 892) FROM THE STUDY OF INFECTION MANAGEMENT AND PALLIATIVE CARE AT THE END-OF-LIFE (SIMP-EL; R01 NR013687; STONE PI AND MENTOR), I FOUND WIDE VARIATION IN NH PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES AT THE END-OF-LIFE. HOWEVER, HEALTH DISPARITIES IN NH PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. FURTHERMORE, IT IS UNKNOWN HOW VARIATIONS IN NH PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS AT THE END-OF-LIFE. GUIDED BY THE GELBERG-ANDERSEN\u2019S BEHAVIORAL MODEL FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, IN THE PROPOSED STUDY I WILL ADDRESS THESE GAPS BY CONDUCTING A SECONDARY, CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS USING MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES (I.E., THE SIMP-EL SURVEY; NH RESIDENT ASSESSMENTS FROM THE MINIMUM DATA SET 3.0; HOSPITAL CLAIMS DATA FROM THE MEDICARE PROVIDER AND ANALYSIS REVIEW; NH FACILITY CHARACTERISTICS FROM THE CERTIFICATION AND SURVEY PROVIDER ENHANCED REPORTING; AND COUNTY LEVEL DATA FROM THE AREA HEALTH RESOURCES FILES). SPECIFICALLY, MY AIMS ARE TO: 1) DESCRIBE PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES PROVIDED IN NHS ACROSS THE NATION AND IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES BY POPULATION SERVED (I.E., PROPORTION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES) AND 2) IDENTIFY ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES AND POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS AT THE END-OF-LIFE BY NH RESIDENT\u2019S RACE/ETHNICITY.

PROBLEMS. WHEN OFFERED IN SCHOOL SETTINGS, THE SOCIAL CONNECTIONS FORMED AMONG PARENTS ATTENDING GROUP-BASED PT MAY GENERATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR PARENTS, SCHOOLS, AND CHILDREN. DEFINED AS THE SENSE OF BELONGING AND TRUST ONE HAS WITHIN A NETWORK OF PEOPLE BEYOND THEIR CLOSE FAMILY OR FRIENDS, SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS (SC) MAY BE AN IMPORTANT, THOUGH LITTLE UNDERSTOOD, MECHANISM UNDERLYING GROUP-BASED PT EFFICACY. SC FORMED IN THE CONTEXT OF GROUP-BASED PT MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR LOW-INCOME PARENTS, WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT SOCIAL ISOLATION THAN HIGHER INCOME PEERS, AND FOR SCHOOLS CHALLENGED WITH HIGH RATES OF CHILD BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS AND LOW RATES OF PARENT ENGAGEMENT. THIS PROPOSED CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE WILL EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH GROUP-BASED PT, DELIVERED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS SERVING PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME STUDENTS AND FAMILIES, GENERATES SC AMONG PARENTS AND IF SC IS ASSOCIATED WITH A) GREATER PARENT ENGAGEMENT IN THEIR CHILD\u2019S EDUCATION AND B) FEWER CHILD BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS.

A PLAN \u2013 ADVANCING SCIENCE FOR THE HEALTH OF WOMEN, THE TRANS-NIH STRATEGIC PLAN FOR WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH RESEARCH \u2013 WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE PERIOD 2019 \u2013 2023. THIS PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK THAT RECOGNIZES THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT AFFECT WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE, INCLUDING PREGNANCY. LIFE COURSE THEORY POSITS THAT HEALTH DEVELOPMENT BEGINS BEFORE CONCEPTION AND CONTINUES ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN. IT SUGGESTS THAT A COMPLEX PLAY OF BIOLOGIC, BEHAVIORAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL PROTECTIVE AND RISK FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND THAT HEALTH STATUS REFLECTS THE CUMULATIVE LIFETIME EXPOSURE TO THESE FACTORS. THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THIS PLAN ARE CONSIDERATION OF THE COMPLEX FACTORS AFFECTING WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH, THE INCLUSION OF DIVERSE POPULATIONS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, AND ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF A DIVERSE GROUP OF SCIENTISTS.7 THE NIH APPROACH TO REDUCING MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WILL AIM TO ENHANCE HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH, INCREASE THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AND OTHER RISK FACTORS (INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS), IMPROVE CARE (ANTEPARTUM, INTRAPARTUM AND POSTPARTUM) AND MANAGEMENT, PROVIDE INSIGHT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPOSURES SUCH AS STRESS, DISCRIMINATION AND CAREGIVING, UNDERSTAND COPING BEHAVIORS IN FAMILIES AFFECTED BY MATERNAL MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY, AND INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS REGARDING PREGNANCY.8 WITHIN NHLBI, MATERNAL AND WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH PRIORITIES SPAN ALL OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE NHLBI STRATEGIC VISION, AND NHLBI HAS SUPPORTED A NUMBER OF MATERNAL HEALTH PROGRAMS LOOKING AT HYPERTENSION, SLEEP DISORDERS, AND OTHER PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING PRE-ECLAMPSIA, ECLAMPSIA, AND GESTATIONAL DIABETES. THE GOAL OF THE NHLBI 3M ADMINISTRATIVE COORDINATING CENTER (3M ACC) IS TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES AND NETWORKS IN AREAS THAT EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY.
