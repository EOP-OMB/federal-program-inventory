LACK OF YOUTH ENGAGEMENT IN HANDS-ON CAREERS AND AGING WORKFORCE CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM. TECHNICAL CENTERS HAVE LOST WOODWORKING PROGRAMS, AND LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN THE WOOD PRODUCTS SECTOR, BOTH HIGHLY SKILLED AND HIGH-TECH. VT WOOD WORKS COUNCIL (VWWC) HAS 60 BUSINESS MEMBERS WHO ARE EAGER TO BE PART OF THE WORKFORCE SOLUTION, PROVIDING EXPERTISE TO TRAINING PROGRAMS, INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, AND PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT TO A NEW CADRE OF WOODWORKERS. THIS PROJECT WILL BUILD A BOTTOM-UP WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAM BASED ON THE NEEDS OF WOODWORKING BUSINESSES IN THE VALUE-ADDED SECONDARY WOODPRODUCTS SECTOR. OVERARCHING GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO: UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF JOBS, SKILLS, TOOLS, MACHINERY, EQUIPMENT, ETC TO TRAIN A WORKFORCE FOR THE FUTURE. INFORM INSTITUTIONS AND TRAINING CENTERS ABOUT THE SKILLS AND TRAINING NEEDED TO SUPPORT FUTURE WOODWORKERS. ENCOURAGE STUDENTS, PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL TO CONSIDER THE BROAD RANGE OF CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN WOODWORKING. PLACE STUDENTS AND PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES IN WOODSHOPS TO GAIN HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE AND DETERMINE IF THIS IS THE RIGHT CAREER CHOICE.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED:THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES WILL SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THIS GRANT: GATHER DATA ON INDUSTRY JOBS, WAGES, SKILLS, EQUIPMENT, MACHINERY, ETC. THROUGH ON-SITE VISITS AND INTERVIEWS WITH VWWC MEMBERS. WORK TO BE COMPLETED BY CONTRACTOR, USING TEMPLATE DEVELOPED. COMPILE DATA IN LOGICAL SORTS. SHARE DATA WITH TECH ED AND TRAINING CENTERS FOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT. SOLICIT AND HIRE A WEB DEVELOPER TO CREATE DATA-DRIVEN WEBSITE, CAREERS IN WOOD DESIGN AND LAUNCH AN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM TO MATCH PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS WITH WOODWORKING BUSINESSES. PROMOTE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES WITH STUDENTS, SCHOOLS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: THE VWWC WILL HAVE BUILT A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF JOBS THAT CAN LEAD TO LIFELONG CAREERS IN WOODWORKING. TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES WILL HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF SKILLS AND TRAINING NEEDED TO SUPPORT FUTURE WORKERS. VWWC BUSINESSES WILL WELCOME AND PROVIDE 4-WEEK INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR AT LEAST TWENTY (20) PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES DURING THE COURSE OF THE GRANT. TRAINING FACILITIES THAT PROVIDE BASIC JOB SKILLS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OUR DATA, OUR BUSINESSES, AND OUR MEMBERS AS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AS THEY CREATE THE CAREERS IN WOOD PATHWAYS. THE CAREERS IN WOOD WEBSITE WILL BE BOTH INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC FACING, DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT SECTOR JOBS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO INCREASE GENERAL AWARENESS ABOUT THE VALUE-ADDED WOOD PRODUCTS SECTOR. THE FOREST ECONOMY REPRESENTS A  1.4 BILLION IMPACT TO VERMONT. AN AGING WORKFORCE AND TENDENCY FOR YOUTH TO LEAVE THE STATE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO FILL JOBS IN THE FOREST AND WOOD PRODUCTS SECTOR. WORKING WITH ONES HANDS IS A TIME-HONORED CRAFT THAT IS NOT ESPECIALLY VALUED IN OUR HIGH-TECH SOCIETY. YET, WOODWORKING JOBS CAN BE HIGH-TECH AND REQUIRE SKILLED WORKERS. WE WILL KEEP YOUTH AT HOME, IN WELL-PAYING JOBS FOR COMPANIES THAT SUPPORT A LOCAL ECONOMY, USE PRODUCTS FROM THE FOREST, BUT TAP WORLDWIDE MARKETS. WOODWORKING IS A LEGACY INDUSTRY WITH A 200  YEAR HISTORY IN VERMONT. VWWC IS ITSELF A COMMUNITY OF LIKEMINDED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SAWDUST IN THEIR VEINS. MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE CHOSEN VERMONT AS THEIR PLACE TO DO BUSINESS. BUT THEY ARE NOT JUST BUSINESSES  THEY ARE CONNECTED BY THEIR LOVE OF THE TRADE.
