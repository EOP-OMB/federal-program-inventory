OUR RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON FOUR THEMATIC AREAS, (1) SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS, (2) NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE ENVIRONMENT, (3) HEALTH <(>&<)> HEALTHY FUTURES, AND (4) WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: ACTIVITIES UNDER EACH OF THE THEMATIC AREAS ARE LISTED BELOW. SUSTAINABLE <(>&<)> RESILIENT AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS: AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS ARE CHALLENGED BY CHANGING CLIMATE AND OTHER THREATS SUCH AS INCREASED INPUT COSTS AND INVASIVE PESTS AND DISEASES. SUSTAINABLE, CLIMATE-SMART, AND RESOURCE-EFFICIENT AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES HELP FARMERS ADAPT TO CHANGE, REMAIN RESILIENT AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. WE SEEK TO CONDUCT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH IN LABORATORIES, PLANT GROWTH FACILITIES AND FARMS AND RANCHES THAT ADVANCES SUSTAINABLE AND REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PRACTICES THAT WILL IMPROVE SOIL HEALTH AND WATER USE EFFICIENCY, SUPPORT DIVERSE CROPS, PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY AND RESILIENCY, IMPROVE PLANT AND ANIMAL GENETICS, AND PROMOTE DIVERSE GRAZING SYSTEMS AND APPROACHES. NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE ENVIRONMENT: MISSOURI ENJOYS THE UNIQUE DISTINCTION AS A CONSERVATION LEADER IN THE COUNTRY. WE ARE BLESSED WITH A DIVERSITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES LIKE FEW OTHER STATES IN THE NATION. THESE RESOURCES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC VITALITY OF OUR STATE. THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF EVERY CITIZEN ALSO DEPENDS ON THE HEALTH OF OUR STATE\u2019S NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE ENVIRONMENT, PARTICULARLY THAT OF OUR AIR, LAND AND SOIL AND WATER RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THESE RESOURCES ARE EXPERIENCING INCREASED PRESSURE AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESSORS WHICH THREATEN THE SUSTAINABLE PROVISION OF THE GOODS (E.G. FOOD PRODUCTION, FOOD QUALITY) AND SERVICES (CLEAN AIR AND WATER) THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON THEM. WE SEEK TO INITIATE CUTTING EDGE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE, ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND RESTORATION, SOIL HEALTH, WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY, ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY, HABITAT EVALUATION, NATURE-BASED RECREATION, VALUING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, GREEN TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPES, ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS AMONG OTHERS HEALTH <(>&<)> HEALTHY FUTURES: LIFE ON PLANET EARTH DEPENDS ON LIFE SUPPORTING GOODS AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COUPLED SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OR ECOSYSTEMS. THE HEALTH OF EARTH\u2019S ECOSYSTEMS HAS DETERIORATED SO MUCH THAT THE PUBLIC IS CONCERNED ABOUT A LOSS OF LIFE SUPPORT FOR ALL ORGANISMS, INCLUDING THE HUMAN COMMUNITY. ECOSYSTEM HEALTH, AS AN INTEGRATIVE CONCEPT, INCLUDES BOTH THE BIOPHYSICAL AND SOCIOECOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS. THE BIOPHYSICAL REALM INCLUDES CLIMATE, AIR, THE ENVIRONMENT, WATER, ENERGY, WILDLIFE, FOOD, SOIL HEALTH AMONG OTHERS. THE SOCIOECONOMIC ASPECTS INCLUDE ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY, SOCIAL SERVICES, RECREATION AND HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH AND WELFARE. THE LATTER IS PARTICULARLY AT RISK IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD NOT ONLY FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION BUT ALSO FROM INCREASING STRESS AND EMERGING PATHOGENS AND DISEASES. WE SEEK TO REVITALIZE AND EXPAND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND ANIMAL, AND HUMAN HEALTH RELATED PROGRAMS, STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND STAKEHOLDERS, AND PROVIDE A TRANSLATIONAL PLATFORM WITH FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, ANIMAL AND HUMAN WELFARE AND HEALTH, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY REFORMS. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY: MISSOURI AN AGRARIAN STATE SUPPORTING A $93.7 BILLION AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. OVER THE NEXT DECADE, THE AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND FORESTRY GRANT13732255 9/13 INDUSTRIES IN MISSOURI ARE PROJECTED TO GENERATE 13,000 JOB OPENINGS ANNUALLY. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, INCLUDING SMART FARMS AND BIG DATA AND DATA ANALYTICS, HAVE CREATED A NUMBER OF NEW JOB OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, FINDING SKILLED LABOR CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE. WE SEEK TO PROVIDE HANDS-ON TRAINING THROUGH BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH RELATED TO AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING, FOOD AND NUTRITION, NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, AND AGRIBUSINESS AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY THAT WILL PRODUCE A WELL-TRAINED WORKFORCE FOR THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY OF THE PRESENT AND FUTURE AND FURTHER THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF AGRICULTURE. DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES: THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL GENERATE (1) SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL ADVANCE AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND NATURAL RESOURCES FOR A HEALTHY FUTURE (2) BETTER CROPS AND CROPPING SYSTEMS THAT WILL BE RESILIENT TO CHANGING CLIMATE AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, (3) BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND QUANTIFICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OF SUSTAINABLE AND REGENERATIVE CROPPING SYSTEMS (E.G. C SEQUESTRATION AS A STRATEGY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION), AND (4) ECONOMIC AND POLICY ANALYSIS THAT CAN HELP FARMERS/RANCHERS/POLICY MAKERS MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS. ALL OF THE ABOVE OUTCOMES WILL ALSO GENERATE PEER REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS, GRADUATE THESES AND DISSERTATIONS, PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATIONS, DEMONSTRATION TRIALS, NEW VARIETIES, INVENTION DISCLOSURES AND PATENTS AND DATA AND MATERIALS TO HELP WITH ASSOCIATED EXTENSION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES.

AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES FOR FIN FISH EXCEEDS 500,000 TONS AND SALES ESTIMATED AT $1.37 BILLION IN 2003. CATFISH INDUSTRY ACCOUNTS FOR 40% OF THIS PRODUCTION GROWN MAINLY IN MISSISSIPPI, ALABAMA, ARKANSAS, AND LOUISIANA. ALABAMA IS THE SECOND AQUACULTURE PRODUCER NATIONWIDE. IN 2016 ALABAMA CATFISH PRODUCTION WAS 34% OF THE ENTIRE CATFISH PRODUCTION NATIONWIDE AND PROVIDED JOBS FOR MORE THAN 26 HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AND THE MAIN AQUACULTURE CATFISH PRODUCTION IS HARVESTED FROM BLACK-BELT COUNTIES. BACTERIAL INFECTIONS ARE THE MAIN RISK FOR THE INDUSTRY. IN COMMERCIAL FARMING, FISH GET MORE INFECTIOUS DISEASES UNLIKE FISH IN THE NATURAL HABITAT. THIS IS DUE TO MANY FACTORS BUT MAINLY THE HUSBANDRY- RELATED FACTORS PLAY THE LEADING CAUSES OF DISEASE. INFECTIOUS DISEASES POSE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO SUCCESSFUL AQUACULTURE. THE MAINTENANCE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF FISH CROWDED TOGETHER IN A SMALL AREA PROVIDES AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. IN THIS CROWDED, RELATIVELY UNNATURAL ENVIRONMENT, FISH ARE STRESSED AND MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISEASE. MOREOVER, THE WATER ENVIRONMENT, AND LIMITED WATER FLOW, FACILITATES THE SPREAD OF PATHOGENS WITHIN THE CROWDED POPULATIONS. AMONG THESE PATHOGENS, BACTERIA ARE MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF EASY SPREAD AND THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE TO THE FISH AND AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY IS SUBSTANTIAL. EDWARDSIELLA SPP., AEROMONAS SPP., FLAVOBACTERIUM COLUMNARIS AND STREPTOCOCCUS INIAE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT BACTERIA THAT POSE GREAT HEALTH THREAT TO FRESHWATER FISH INDUSTRY IN ALABAMA.

NOT ONLY DOES MASTITIS REDUCE POUNDS OF MILK MARKETED, BUT IT ALSO RESULTS IN LOSSES OF PREGNANCY IF THE DISEASE OCCURS SHORTLY AFTER INSEMINATION. THESE LOSSES OF PREGNANCY ARE DUE TO EARLY EMBRYONIC LOSSES AND DELAY THE TIME UNTIL THE COW CAN BECOME PREGNANT AGAIN. THE INCREASED DAYS THAT A COW IS NOT PREGNANT REPRESENTS A FINANCIAL LOSS TO THE PRODUCER AND MAY LEAD TO INCREASED CULLING RATES. MASTITIS CAUSES CHARACTERISTIC CHANGES THAT ACCOMPANY AN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SUCH AS FEVER, LOSS OF APPETITE, AND LETHARGY. THOSE CHANGES ARE INDUCED BY SUBSTANCES FROM CELLS IN THE COW'S IMMUNE SYSTEM TO PROTECT HER FROM BACTERIA. MIMICKING THE DISEASE IN CATTLE IS EXPENSIVE BOTH IN MATERIALS FOR RESEARCH AND THE MAINTENANCE OF THE ANIMAL DUE TO ITS LARGE SIZE. A SIMPLER MODEL USING SUBSTANCES ISOLATED FROM THE CELL WALL OF BACTERIA THAT ARE INJECTED INTO SHEEP FIVE DAYS AFTER MATING RESULTS IN INCREASED BODY TEMPERATURE AND RELEASE OF SUBS TANCES FROM THE IMMUNE CELLS. USING THAT MODEL, EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES RELEASED DURING AN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE ON THE MAINTENANCE OF PREGNANCY.

BASED ON PAST STUDIES USING THIS ANIMAL MODEL, ANIMALS RECOVER FROM TEMPERATURE CHANGE WITHIN 12 HOURS AND DO NOT SHOW ANY OVERT SIGNS AFTER 24 HOURS. BODY TEMPERATURES WILL BE RECORDED AT BLOOD SAMPLING, AND OTHER VISIBLE SIGNS WILL BE MONITORED T HROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT.

THIS ENSURES THE RESEARCH IS BOTH INFORMED BY, AND INFORMS, THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WHO WILL BENEFIT THE MOST FROM NEW KNOWLEDGE. EIGHTY PERCENT OF MAES FACULTY ARE IN BOZEMAN. MAES HAS SEVEN OFF CAMPUS RESEARCH CENTERS AND SIX FARMS.  ALL ANIMAL HEALTH PROJECTS AT MSU ARE BASED WITHIN THE COA/MAES. ANIMAL HEALTH PROJECTS HAVE AN INTEGRATED FOCUS ON DEVELOPING ADVANCED SOLUTIONS TO DIVERSE CHALLENGES FACING MONTANA, THE REGION, THE NATION, AND THE WORLD. MSU\u2019S MICROBIOLOGY AND CELL BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT (MCB) AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL AND RANGE SCIENCES (A<(>&<)>RS) HAVE FACULTY FOCUSED ON ANIMAL HEALTH. MAJOR FOCI ARE INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF CATTLE, BISON, AND SHEEP. INFECTIOUS DISEASES CAUSE LOSSES FOR LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS BY REDUCING THE PRODUCTION OF ANIMAL UNITS, BY MEASURES TAKEN TO PROTECT LIVESTOCK HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND BY REDUCED SALES BECAUSE OF FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS. SELECTED FACULTY JOINING MCB AND AR<(>&<)>S ARE INVITED TO INITIATE NEW HATCH AND MULTISTATE RESEARCH PROJECTS. SOME OF THE TOP ISSUES BEING ADDRESSED CURRENTLY INCLUDE A STUDY USING PHAGE THERAPY TO TREAT BRUCELLA ABORTUS, A PATHOGEN OF CATTLE, BISON, ELK, AMONG OTHER ANIMALS, INCLUDING HUMANS, AND PROJECTS ON MYCOPLASMA OVIPNEUMONIAE, A RESPIRATORY PATHOGEN OF DOMESTIC AND BIGHORN SHEEP. ADDITIONALLY, A STUDY OF ALPHA-HERPES VIRUSES ON ANIMAL HEALTH IS ALSO UNDERWAY, ALONG WITH COMPLIMENTARY STUDIES OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF NUTRI TION TO HORSE, CATTLE AND SHEEP HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. COA/MAES USES SCIENCE-BASED APPROACHES SUCH AS IMPLEMENTATION OF PRECISION AND DATA-INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL NUTRITION, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCH TO ADDRESS ANIMAL AND HUMAN SAFETY.

LOSSES ATTRIBUTED TO BRDC STEM FROM MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, LOSS OF FEED EFFICIENCY, AND TREATMENT COSTS, LARGELY ANTIBIOTICS. PRIOR TO CHANGES TO THE VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVE IN 2017, ANTIBIOTICS WERE COMMONLY GIVEN TO CATTLE PROPHYLACTICALLY, OFTEN IN FEED, TO MINIMIZE THE INCIDENCE OF BRDC. DUE TO CONCERNS OF INCREASING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE, MORE JUDICIOUS USE OF ANTIBIOTICS WAS MANDATED WHICH HAS FURTHER EXACERBATED BRDC. DECREASING ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS HAS FOCUSED ATTENTION ON VACCINES. MULTIVALENT VACCINES CONTAINING COMBINATIONS OF ATTENUATED LIVE AND INACTIVATED RESPIRATORY VIRUSES (BVDV, BRSV, BHV1 AND BPIV3) AND BACTERIA (M. HAEMOLYTICA, P. MULTOCIDA, AND H. SOMNI) ARE COMMONLY USED. DESPITE THEIR USE, USDA DATA SHOWS INCREASED BRDC INCIDENCE OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS (HILTON, 2014; GORDEN AND PLUMMER, 2010). SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS HAVE CHARACTERIZED THE VIROMES OF BRDCAFFECTED ANIMALS AND SOUGHT TO CORRELATE VIRUS DETECTION WITH CLINICAL DISEASE. NG. ET AL. (2015) PERFORMED METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING ON 50 DAIRY CALVES WITH BRDC AND 50 HEALTHY PEN MATES AT A SINGLE LARGE CALF RANCH IN CALIFORNIA. VIRUSES DETECTED THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BRD INCLUDED BOVINE ADENOVIRUS 3, BOVINE RHINITIS A VIRUS, AND INFLUENZA D VIRUS (ALL P<(><<)>0.01). SIMILARLY, ZHANG ET AL. (2019) PERFORMED METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING ON NASAL AND TRACHEAL SWABS COLLECTED FROM BOTH HEALTHY AND CATTLE WITH BRDC ON FOUR FEEDLOTS IN WESTERN CANADA. INFLUENZA D VIRUS, BOVINE RHINITIS A AND B VIRUSES, BRSV, AND BOVINE CORONAVIRUS DETECTION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE. LIKEWISE, METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING OF DISEASED AND HEALTHY FEEDLOT CATTLE IN THE U.S. AND MEXICO FOUND A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN IDV RNA LEVELS AND CLINICAL DISEASE (MITRA ET AL., 2011). A COMMON FINDING OF THE THREE GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITED METAGENOMIC SURVEYS WAS A DEARTH OF DETECTION OF VIRUSES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH BRDC AND INCLUDED IN BRDC VACCINES, WITH ONLY BRSV BEING ASSOCIATED WITH BRDC IN THE WESTERN CANAD IAN FEEDLOT STUDY. INFLUENZA D VIRUS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH BRDC IN ALL THREE PUBLICATIONS, AS WAS BOVINE RHINITIS A VIRUS IN TWO OF THE THREE PAPERS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SEVERAL VIRUSES NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED AS ETIOLOGICAL CAUSES OF BRDC LIKELY PLAY A SIGN IFICANT ROLE IN DISEASE. SIMILAR TO CATTLE, PORCINE RESPIRATORY DISEASE COMPLEX (PRDC) IS A MULTIFACTORIAL DISEASE WHICH MANIFESTS AT THE INTERSECTION OF HOST, ENVIRONMENT, AND PATHOGEN (OPRIESSNIG ET AL., 2011). WHILE THE THREE PRIMARY VIRAL PATHOGENS ASSOCIATED WITH PRDC ARE IAV, PRRSV, AND PCV2, METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING OF RESPIRATORY DISEASE SAMPLES NEGATIVE FOR TYPICAL PRDC VIRUSES HAVE IDENTIFIEDPOTENTIALLY EMERGING RESPIRATORY VIRUSES SUCH AS PORCINE PARAINFLUENZA VIRUS (PARK ET AL., 2019), PORCINE CIRCOVIRUS 3 (PALINSKI ET AL, 2016), AND PORCINE ASTROVIRUS 4 (PADMANABHAN AND HAUSE, 2016). A RECENT METAGENOMIC SURVEY OF THE VIROMES OF PRDCAFFECTED PIGS IN CHINA IDENTIFIED 17 VIRUSES (QIN ET AL., 2018). COMPARISONS OF VIRUSES DETECTED IN PRDCAFFECTED PIGS VERSUS HEALTHY, LOCATION MATCHED CONTROLS FOUND SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS (P LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.01) BETWEEN PCV2, PRRSV, GRANT13740985 9/14 PORCINE PARVOVIRUS 2, PORCINE PARVOVIRUS 3, PORCINE PARVOVIRUS 6, AND TORQUE TENO VIRUS DETECTION AND CLINICAL DISEASE. RESPIRATORY DISEASE IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF LOSS FOR THE SWINE AND CATTLE INDUSTRIES. IN BOTH SPECIES, RESPIRATORY DISEASE IS RECOGNIZED AS MULTIFACTORIAL, WITH CLINICAL OUTCOMES DICTATED BY HOST, PATHOGEN, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. DISEASE ETIOLOGY IS THOUGHT TO INVOLVE A PRIMARY VIRAL INSULT FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY PNEUMONIA CAUSED BY COMMENSAL AND OPPORTUNISTIC BACTERIA. A VARIETY OF VIRUSES HAVE BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED AS PRIMARY RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS IN BOTH SWINE AND CATTLE, HOWEVER DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OF ACUTE DISEASE SPECIMENS OFTEN FAILS TO IDENTIFY CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS. NEWER TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING, ARE BROADENING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PATHOGENS INVOLVED IN THE ETIOLOGY OF RESPIRATORY DISEASE. THE LONG TERM GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH BOVINE AND PORCINE RESPIRATORY DISEASE. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY FIVE OBJECTIVES: OBJECTIVE 1: CHARACTERIZE THE VIROME PRESENT IN NASAL SWAB SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM SWINE AND CATTLE WITH RESPIRATORY DISEASE VIA METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING; OB JECTIVE 2: IDENTIFY INFECTIOUS VIRUSES AND ESTABLISH DISEASE ETIOLOGY USING IMMUNOCAPTURE SEQUENCING; OBJECTIVE 3: PROPAGATE NOVEL AND EMERGING VIRUSES IN CELL CULTURE USING TRADITIONAL CELL CULTURE BASED APPROACHES OR REVERSE GENETICSLAUNCHED VIRUSES; OBJECTIVE 4: CHARACTERIZE VIRUS PATHOGENESIS IN THE HOST ANIMAL AND ESTABLISHLL PERMIT THE RAPID, TARGETED DEVELOPMENT OF KILLED, PROTEIN-BASED VACCINES TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT CAN OCCUR WITHIN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE, THESE APPROACHES ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND ADAPTIVE, PERMITTING RAPID RESPONSE TO NEWLY EMERGING, OR RAPIDLY CHANGING, DISEASE ORGANISMS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL USING MORE TRADITIONAL VACCINE DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES. GIVEN THESE CHANGES, THERE EXISTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP \"PLATFORM APPROACHES\" FOR VACCINE PRODUCTION IN A MANNER COMMENSURATE WITH INDUSTRY NEEDS. TO THAT END, THE FOCUS OF THIS WORK IS TO OPTIMIZE PLATFORM-BASED APPROACHES FOR PRODUCTION OF NEW GRANT13740985 10/14 VACCINES FOR PRODUCTION ANIMALS. ONCE THIS BASE PLATFORM IS OPTIMIZED, IT WILL BE EASY TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO PRODUCE A RANGE OF VACCINES. OUR WORK WILL START WITH ESTABLISHED METHODS FOR PRODUCTION OF PROTEINS SPECIFIC TO VACCINE DEVELOPMENT IN MULTIPLE SYSTEMS, OPTIMIZE THOSE SYSTEMS TO INCREASE THE SPEED AND SPECIFICITY OF RESPONSES FOR PRODUCTION OF VACCINE ANTIGENS, AND FINALLY DEVELOP APPROPRIATE TOOLS TO MEASURE VACCINE RESPONSIVENESS IN ANIMALS. THE WORK TO BE CONDUCTED IN THIS PROJECT IS NOVEL, AS IT TARGETS NEW APPROACHES FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT THAT HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN LEVERAGED. ONCE DEVELOPED, THE METHODS CAN BE TRANSLATED TO COMMERCIAL PARTNERS FOR DEVELOPMENT INTO NEW VACCINES, ENHANCING PERFORMANCE AND REDUCING COSTS IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH INDUSTRY. OBJECTIVE 1: DEVELOP NEW APPROACHES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NON-REPLICATING VACCINE PRODUCTS FOR CONTROL OF ANIMAL DISEASE. IN THE FIRST OBJECTIVE WE WILL INVESTIGATE APPROACHES THAT ALLOW US TO APPLY A \"PLATFORM APPROACH\" TO THE PRODUCTION OF ANIMAL VACCINE PRODUCTS. THESE PLATFORMS MAY INVOLVE YEAST, BACTERIAL, INSECT CELLS, OR PLANT CELLS TO PRODUCE PROTEINS THAT CAN BE USED AS VACCINES TO PROTECT AGAINST ANIMAL DISEASE. OUR FOCUS WILL BE TO DEVELOP NEW VACCINE TARGETS FOR EMERGING DISEASES, OPTIMIZE PRODUCTION OF THOSE TARGETS BY MANIPULATING THE PLATFORM EXPRESSION SYSTEMS DEVELOPED, AND REDUCE THE TIME TO IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW VACCINES. IN ADDITION, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE USE OF THESE PLATFORM VACCINE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS TO DEVELOP METHODS TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE PROTECTION AGAINST INFECTION THROUGH ADMINISTRATION OF \"PASSIVE\" IMMUNITY IN AN ECONOMICAL, EFFECTIVE FORMAT. SUCCESS OF THIS OBJECTIVE WILL BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF TRANSLATION TO PRACTICE THROUGH COMMERCIAL PRACTICE, DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TOOLS FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AS PUBLISHED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE OR SUBMITTED AS NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR PATENT, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PARTNERSHIPS TO ENHANCE DEVELOPMENT. OBJECTIVE 2: DEVELOP NEW MECHANISMS TO INCREASE IMMUNOGENICITY OF NON-REPLICATING VACCINE PRODUCTS A SECOND OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF PROTEIN-BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PLATFORM SYSTEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE TO ENHANCE IMMUNITY IN VACCINATED ANIMALS. THIS APPROACH WILL DRAW UPON METHODS TO ENHANCE THE TARGET PROTEINS FORMING THE BASIS OF THE VACCINE, AS WELL AS TO ENHANCE THE DELIVERY OF THOSE VACCINE PROTEINS TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO PROMOTE STRONG IMMUNE RESPONSES. WHILE THE SAME PLATFORM SYSTEMS DEVELOPED IN OBJECTIVE 1 WILL BE USED IN OBJECTIVE 2, THE GOAL WILL BE TO ENHANCE THE ONSET, LEVEL, AND DURATION OF IMMUNITY GENERATED BY THESE NOVEL VACCINE FORMULATIONS. OBJECTIVE 3: DEVELOP SELECTIVE DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS TO SUPPORT OF NEW VACCINE APPROACHES. IN OUR FINAL OBJECTIVE WE WILL PARTNER WITH THE SOUTH DAKOTA ANIMAL RESEARCH AND DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF TARGET PROTEINS PRODUCED IN THESE SYSTEMS AS DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS FOR ANIMAL DISEASE. THESE DIAGNOSTICS MAY INVOLVE GRANT13740985 11/14 LABORATORY-BASED SYSTEMS THAT CAN BE USED AND VALIDATED FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ANIMAL DISEASE, OR ALTERNATIVELY NEW SYSTEMS FOR PEN-SIDE SCREENING SYSTEMS TO MONITOR ANIMAL DISEASE IN THE FIELD.

SPECIFICALLY, PRECISION DAIRY TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED TO DISCRIMINATE THE PROPORTIONAL HEALTH LOSS BETWEEN DISEASED (SUBCLINICAL, CLINICAL) AND HEALTHY CALVES FROM BIRTH THROUGH 1ST AND 2ND PARITIES.

IT INCLUDES THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT EXTENSION) AND THE TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (UT AGRESEARCH). BASED IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY (TSU) IS THE STATES 1890 INSTITUTION; IT INCLUDES THE TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. THIS PLAN OF WORK REPRESENTS THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF UT EXTENSION, UT AGRESEARCH, TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM, AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH.  AGRICULTURE IS INTEGRAL TO TENNESSEES ECONOMY AND CULTURE. ALMOST ONE OF EVERY EIGHT TO NINE DOLLARS GENERATED IN THE STATE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE OR AN INDUSTRY THAT GENERATES PRODUCTS FROM A NATURAL RESOURCE  MORE THAN $79.3 BILLION ANNUALLY. THE STATES AGRICULTURAL AND RELATED EXPORTS TOTALED $2.2 BILLION IN 2021, UP $325 MILLION OR 17% WHEN COMPARED TO 2020. TENNESSEE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN ALL MAJOR COMMODITY CATEGORIES IN 2021. FARM RECEIPTS TOTALED $3.6 BILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 65.5% OF THIS VALUE COMING FROM CROPS AND 34.5% FROM ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC SUCCESSES OF TENNESSEE AGRICULTURE, 339,400 TENNESSEANS ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED BY AGRICULTURAL OR NATURAL RESOURCE INDUSTRIES, MAKING EFFECTIVE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS CRITICAL. TENNESSEES LANDGRANT INSTITUTIONS CONDUCT RESEARCH AND PROVIDE EXTENSION OUTREACH IN FIVE KEY AREAS TO ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THE STATE: SUPPORTING FOOD, FIBER, AND ENERGY SYSTEMS; ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; ENRICHING OUR ECONOMY; DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE; AND STRENGTHENING OUR HEALTH. RESEARCH PROJECTS PROVIDE NEW KNOWLEDGE TO HELP STAKEHOLDERS A DDRESS ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEM. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES SHARE THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ULTIMATELY TO RESULT IN A CHANGE IN ACTION OR CONDITION.  EXTENSION WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING NEEDS CITIZENS AND AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS ACROSS THE STATE. HEALTH ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE TOP CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. EXTENSION WILL STRENGTHEN HEALTH PROGRAMMING BY OFFERING THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR IMPROVING DIETARY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR LIMITEDRESOURCE TENNESSEANS. EXTENSION LIVESTOCK AND FORAGE PROGRAMS STRENGTHEN OUR EXTENSION AND RESEARCH FOR THE STATES LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS, RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL WILL JOINTLY IMPLEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH IN HAY SCHOOLS, LATE GESTATION NUTRITION, MARKETING, FORAGE TESTING, AND STOCKPILED FORAGES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION HAS DEVELOPED PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN AND PROVIDE VALUEADDEDOPPORTUNITIES FOR PRODUCERS. THE UT CENTER FOR FARM MANAGEMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS IN 2022. THE CENTER FACILITATES EXTENSION, TEACHING, AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS ON FARM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. THE CENTER WILL FOCUS ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF TENNESSEE PRODUCERS AND ENHANCING LONGTERM PROFITABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURE ENTERPRISES. THROUGH THE CROPS PRODUCTION SYSTEMS EXTENSIONS PROVIDE DEMONSTRATION AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT BENEFITS PRODUCERS. THE CROP VARIETY TRIALS FOR CORN GRAIN, SILAGE, AND SOYBEANS AS WELL AS PRODUCER EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR CORN, SOYBEANS, COTTON, WHEAT, AND TOBACCO PRODUCTION ARE KEY AREAS. THE CONSUMER ECONOMICS PROGRAM HELPS FAMILIES INCREASE SAVINGS, DECREASE DEBT, AND FINANCIALLY PLAN. THE ON MY OWN AND 4H WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED FOR YOUTH AND ADULTS THAT PROVIDE NEEDED SKILLS, TRAININGS, AND EXPERIENCES TO PARTICIPANTS. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OF TOP PRIORITYFOR EXTENSION. EXTENSION CONTINUES DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE AND PROVIDE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE NEXT CHAPTER PROGRAM IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND TENNESSEE 4H. IN CREATING THIS PROGRAM, WE WANT TO CREATE AN EARLY DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT SKILLS ARE NECESSARY FOR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BOTH THEIR SECONDARY AND POSTSECONDARY PLANS. 4H CONTINUES PROGRAMING ON HONING STEM AND CITIZENSHIP/LEADERSHIP SKILLS.  UT AGRESEARCH CONDUCTS RESEARCH WITHIN ITS EIGHT ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND SEVEN PHYSICAL CENTERS, AND AT TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS (REC) LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE UNITS HELP DRIVE PLANNED RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND FACILITATE FACULTY RESEARCH PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO A DECADE OF EXCELLENCE: TENYEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR UTIA, 20182028 , AGRESEARCH OPERATES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF ITS 20212024 AGRESEARCH STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN WITH THE OBJECTIVES TO BALANCE A PORTFOLIO OF INTEGRATED, INTERDISCIPLICAPACITY IN PRECISION LIVESTOCK FARMING (PLF). THE PROGRAM INCORPORATES BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT ULTIMATELY WILL CONTRIBUTE INFORMATION TO REFINE STRATEGIES THAT OFFER CARBON REDUCTIONS OVER TODAY\u2019S AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS. AGRESEARCH IS REALIGNING THE CAPABILITIES AT TWO OF ITS TEN REC TO FACILITATE PLF INITIATIVE. THE LITTLE RIVER ANIMAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT PLANS TO HAVE MILKING ROBOTS IN OPERATION BY LATE FALL 2022, AND THE MIDDLE TENNESSEE REC IS RETOOLING TO SUPPORT PRECISION BEEF AND POULTRY PRODUCTION RESEARCH. ALSO, EXPANDED ACTIVITY IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE WILL RESPOND TO CONCERNS OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION.  THE TRANSFORMATIONAL AGRICULTURAL GENOMICS AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY PROGRAM WILL ADVANCE ANIMAL AND PLANT-BASED PRODUCTIVITY. ALTHOUGH EARLY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT, THE INITIATIVE ALREADY ENGAGES FACULTY TO ADVANCE STATE-OF-THE-ART SCIENCE TO DESIGN CROPS THAT ARE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. FINALLY, THE BIOECONOMY ADVANCEMENT INITIATIVE IS AN ESTABLISHED INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABLE FUELS, CHEMICALS, AND MATERIALS. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IS EXPANDING RESEARCH CAPABILITIES IN SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AGGRESSIVE GRAND CHALLENGE GOALS ANNOUNCED BY THE WHITE HOUSE.  MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PROCESSES TENNESSEE EXTENSION PROGRAMS FUNDED BY SMITH-LEVER OR NARETPA SECTION 1444 AND 1445 REQUIRE A MERIT REVIEW PROCESS. A PANEL OF EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS, PROGRAM LEADERS AND SCHOLARS FROM FOUR STATES REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TENNESSEE EXTENSION MERIT REVIEW CRITERIA. CRITERIA INCLUDES ASSESSING NEEDS, DELIVERY METHODS, IMPLEMENTATION STEPS, EVALUATION, ENSURING DIVERSITY AND DEFINED OUTCOMES. UT AND TSU COORDINATE MERIT REVIEW PROCESSES. STATE EXTENSION SPECIALISTS PROPOSE PLANNED PROGRAMS. ALL PROPOSED PROGRAMS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY A REVIEW TEAM OF UT EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS AND SPECIALISTS.  UT AGRESEARCH WILL UTILIZE THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE IT HAS PROVEN TO BE BOTH EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. HATCH REGULAR AND HATCH/MULTI-STATE RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERGO A REVIEW PROCESS FOR MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS, AND TO ENSURE ALIGNMENT WITH ESTABLISHED RESEARCH PRIORITIES. THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR HATCH REGULAR RESEARCH PROJECTS BEGINS INFORMALLY WITH DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PROJECT DIRECTOR, COLLEAGUES, THE DEPARTMENT HEAD, AND, IF APPLICABLE, AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS (IF FIELD WORK IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT). A REVIEW PANEL OF THREE SCIENTISTS THEN EVALUATES THE PROPOSAL FOR CLARITY, TECHNICAL RELEVANCE, AND SCIENTIFIC MERIT. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR MAKES ANY NECESSARY REVISIONS AND SUBMITS THE PROPOSAL TO THE DEPARTMENT HEAD FOR REVIEW. IF APPROVED, THE DEAN/DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH THEN CONDUCTS A FINAL EVALUATION AND ENDORSES THE PROPOSAL FOR SUBMISSION TO NIFA.  HATCH/MULTI-STATE PROJECTS GO THROUGH A COMPARATIVELY MORE EXTENSIVE REVIEW AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL, SO THE INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS IS ABBREVIATED. THE FACULTY MEMBER OFFICIALLY JOINS A MULTI-STATE PROJECT AFTER CONSULTING WITH COLLEAGUES AND, IF APPLICABLE, THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR THEN SUBMITS A PROPOSAL REFLECTING THE UT COMPONENT DIRECTLY TO THE ASSOCIATE DEAN/ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT. ONCE THE REVIEW IS COMPLETE AND ANY NECESSARY CHANGES ARE MADE, THE RESEARCHER SUBMITS THE PROJECT TO NIFA.  STAKEHOLDER INPUT UT EXTENSION PURSUED MULTIPLE DATA COLLECTIONS FOR THIS PLAN OF WORK. ALL 95 COUNTIES HAVE LOCAL EXTENSION ADVISORY GROUPS THAT PROVIDE ONGOING STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE UT-TSU EXTENSION STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL REVIEWS AND UPDATES PLANS BI-ANNUALLY. EXTENSIVE STRATEGIC PLAN ACTIVITIES ALSO INFORMED THIS PLAN. EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND STATE AGENCY LEADERS PARTICIPATED IN SURVEYS, LISTENING SESSIONS AND FOCUS GROUPS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW EXTENSION COULD ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. BASED ON THIS INPUT, THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL IDENTIFIED PLAN PRIORITIES. NEW STATE ACTION AGENDAS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS PRIORITIES. PLANS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE PROGRESS AND MAKE CHANGES.  UT AGRESEARCH CONTINUES TO SEEK STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THROUGH SEVERAL MEANS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR TO DISCUSS AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES, UTIA PROGRAM PRIORITIES, AND HOW UTIA, INCLUDING UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION, MAY RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES. SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE TENNESSEE FARM BUREAU, AND SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE TENNESSEE STATE GOVERNMENT ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF COMMON RESEARCH INTERESTS. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS SERVE THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS AT THE INVITATION OF THE DEPARTMENT HEAD AND CENTER DIRECTOR, RESPECTIVELY, TO PROVIDE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES. FACULTY HELP DRIVE THE UT AGRESEARCH AGENDA BY REMAINING ABREAST OF EMERGING RESEARCH AND ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, PROGRAM LEADERS WITH STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING AGENCIES, THE PUBLIC, AND AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE UT SYSTEM IS COMPLETING A SURVEY THAT WENT STATEWIDE REGARDING PUBLIC INPUT INTO THE GRAND CHALLENGES FACING TENNESSEE. THIS WAS A UT SYSTEM EFFORT, BUT UT EXTENSION AND UT AGRESEARCH ASSISTED IN SHARING THE SURVEY ACROSS TENNESSEE AND THE RESULTS WILL CERTAINLY ADD TO THE INFORMATION WE USE TO DETERMINE DIRECTIONS FOR OUR WORK.  UT AND TSU EXTENSION WILL EMPLOY THEIR EXTENSIVE, STATEWIDE NETWORK OF ADVISORY GROUPS FOR STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL PROVIDES INPUT AND DIRECTION FOR STATEWIDE INITIATIVES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION AGENTS WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON INVOLVING YOUTH AND OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES. ALL OF TENNESSEE'S 95 COUNTIES HAVE A COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE OF SEVEN LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, NOMINATED BY THE COUNTY MAYOR AND APPROVED BY MAJORITY VOTE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSION. EVERY COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEETS FOUR TIMES ANNUALLY, AND THEIR DUTIES INCLUDE INPUT INTO HIRING DECISIONS, LOCAL FUNDING, AND LOCAL PROGRAMMING.  UT AGRESEARCH IMPLEMENTS SEVERAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS FOR INPUT. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE STATE GOVERNMENT, AND THE COMMUNITY. IT HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP ON RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION ISSUES. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS ARE COMPRISED OF THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE AND DEANS, REPRESENTATIVES FROM TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY GROUPS, AND CLIENTELE SERVED BY UTIA PROGRAMS. UTIA PERSONNEL NOMINATE THE COMMODITY GROUPAND CLIENTELE MEMBERS. EACH OF THE THREE REGIONAL ADVISORY GROUPS ELECTS A CHAIR TO GUIDE MEETINGS. IN ADDITION, UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. AS NEW PRIORITIES ARISE, THESE GROUPS SEEK OUT ONE ANOTHER TO DISCUSS COMMON RESEARCH NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS FOR THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS\u2019 AND GROUPS\u2019 RELEVANT BACKGROUND, EXPERTISE, AND COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. UT AGRESEARCH FACULTY REGULARLY INTERACT WITH THEIR PEERS AT PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND THROUGH JOINT PROJECT VENTURES. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS ENCOURAGE FACULTY TO MEET WITH PROGRAM LEADERS AT STATE AND NATIONAL FUNDING AGENCIES TO DISCUSS RESEARCH PRIORITIES. ADDITIONALLY, FACULTY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET WITH THE PUBLIC DURING AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER FIELD DAY EVENTS. TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT/TSU) AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS ARE TRAINED IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES AND HOW TO SELECT INDIVIDUALS FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES. COMMUNITY LEADERS SELECTED FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSITIES (I.E., GENDER, AGE, RACIAL/ETHNIC, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, EDUCATIONAL, ETC.) OF THE COUNTY OR AREA SERVED. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE CONDUCTS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR (SPECIFIC TO UT EXTENSION). EXTENSION AGENTS RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PAST AND CURRENT EXTENSION PROGRAMS; AND THEY RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT USED EXTENSION TO SERVE ON LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND PARTICIPATE IN OPEN LISTENING SESSIONS. EXTENSION AGENTS ALSO CONDUCT SURVEYS ON PLANNED PROGRAM AREAS.  UT AGRESEARCH COLLECTS INPUT THROUGH REGULAR CONTACT WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE AND THE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR. THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE RESPONDS TO ANY ISSUES RAISED, AND, AS APPROPRIATE, MAY DELEGATE ACTION TO THE DEANS/DIRECTORS OF UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS MEET WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THEY HAVE FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS WITH THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT HEADS AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS WITH THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER DIRECTORS MONTHLY; COLLECTIVELY THEY MEET ONCE PER YEAR. THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS MEET WITH THEIR ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS ANNUALLY AND SHARE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WITH AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY AS APPROPRIATE. FACULTY ATTEND PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND READ SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND POPULAR PRESS ARTICLES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. DEPARTMENTS HOLD MONTHLY FACULTY MEETINGS WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS WITH PEERS AND THEIR DEPARTMENT HEAD.  STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES AT LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND STATEWIDE LEVEL MONITOR AND ADJUST DEPLOYMENT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, THE OPINIONS FROM MANY TENNESSEANS, INCLUDING DECISION-MAKERS, CLIENTELE, PARTNERS, AND VOLUNTEERS WERE CONSIDERED. MORE THAN 120 STAKEHOLDERS AND 490 UT EXTENSION EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATED IN THE REGIONAL AND CAMPUS LISTENING SESSIONS. THE PLANNING EFFORT ALSO INCLUDED AN ONLINE SURVEY COMPONENT.

POINT-OF-CARE ANALYZERS CAN IMMEDIATELY GIVE INFORMATION ON BLOOD GAS AND ELECTROLYTE LEVELS IN PATIENTS, WHICH LETS THE VETERINARIAN DEVISE THE TREATMENTS NEEDED FOR THAT ANIMAL WITHOUT THE DELAY ASSOCIATED WITH SENDING SAMPLES TO A LABORATORY. THE PROPOSED STUDY SEEKS TO VALIDATE THE USE OF A COMMERCIAL POINT-OF-CARE ANALYZER IN GOATS TO DETERMINE IF THE RESULTS FROM THE ANALYZER CAN BE USED CONFIDENTLY TO GUIDE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. BLOOD WILL BE COLLECTED FROM 50 GOATS THAT ARE PATIENTS AT THE VETERINARY HOSPITAL. THE BLOOD WILL BE ANALYZED BY THE POINT-OF-CARE ANALYZER AND BY THREE DIFFERENT STANDARD BENCH-TOP MACHINES. THE DATA WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE AGREEMENT OF THE POINT-OF-CARE ANALYZER WITH VALUES OBTAINED BY THE STANDARD METHODS. OUR SECOND STUDY ON SMALL RUMINANTS FOCUSES ON ANESTHESIA. TREATMENT OF SMALL RUMINANTS FOR CONDITIONS SUCH AS BLADDER STONES AND RUMEN DISORDERS MAY INVOLVE ANESTHESIA, AND INHALANT ANESTHETICS SUCH AS DESFLUORANE ARE BEING USED MORE FREQUENTLY TO PROVIDE SAFE ANESTHESIA AND RAPID RECOVERY. LARGE ANIMAL PATIENTS REQUIRE MORE DESFLURANE THAN DO SMALL ANIMALS, AND ARE TYPICALLY DETACHED FROM THE ANESTHETIC BREATHING CIRCUIT DURING RECOVERY, WHICH LEADS TO THE ELIMINATION OF ANESTHETIC GASES DIRECTLY INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS STUDY, THE OFF-GASSING OF DESFLUORANE WILL BE MEASURED DURING RECOVERY OF SMALL RUMINANT PATIENTS IN OUR VETERINARY HOSPITAL. ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING OF THE OPERATING ROOM, ANESTHESIA MACHINE, AND ANESTHESIA WORKING AREA WILL BE PERFORMED FOR ONE MONTH. ENVIRONMENTAL LEVELS AND DOSIMETER BADGE RESULTS WILL BE ANALYZED TO DOCUMENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND EXPOSURE DURING THE ONE-MONTH SAMPLING TIMEFRAME. OUR FOURTH STUDY IS ON EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF MANIPULATION OF THE RUMEN MICROBIOME ON METHANE EMISSIONS IN CATTLE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT METHANE EMISSIONS CAN BE MEASURED PRECISELY. FOR THIS STUDY, WE WILL REQUIRE ANALYZERS TO CAPTURE BREATH SAMPLES FROM COWS AND THEN PROVIDE THE COMPOSITION OF INDIVIDUAL GASES IN THE EXPIRED AIR, INCLUDING CARBON DIOXIDE, METHANE, AND HYDROGEN.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "75401b4c-967a-1918-9977-217d3ef9ce68-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23AHDRXXXXG046_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736108, "Award ID": "NI23AHDRXXXXG045", "Award Amount": 51496.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-29", "CFDA Number": "10.207", "Description": "UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE RESEARCH FUND ABSTRACT THE PURPOSE OF THIS AWARD IS TO SUPPORT RESEARCH THAT ADDRESSES PRESSING ISSUE IN ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE PREVENTION OR TREATMENT.

THIS WILL CREATE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS THAT WILL BE REPORTED WIDELY TO STAKEHOLDERS. GOAL 3: INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS WITH APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY - EXTENSION USES ESTABLISHED AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES STRATEGICALLY TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES, EXPAND OUTREACH AND ENHANCE AND REPORT THE OUTCOMES OF ITS EDUCATIONAL SERVICES.  THE AES STATION UNITS ACROSS THE STATE, UTILIZE INPUT FROM AFFILIATED ADVISORY COMMITTEES, FROM FACULTY RESEARCH EXPERTS, LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING FARMERS AND RANCHERS, FORESTERS, AGENCY PERSONNEL, ELECTED LEADERS, EDUCATORS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND MYRIAD OTHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES TO ESTABLISH NEED AND DESIGN APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING. IN MANY CASES, STAKEHOLDERS ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAMMING AS VOLUNTEERS OR BY PERMITTING DEMONSTRATIONS AND APPLIED RESEARCH TRIALS ON THEIR PROPERTIES. WE RECENTLY AUGMENTED OUR ABILITIES TO CONNECT WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS DIVERSE INTEREST AREAS AND TO GAIN ADVICE REGARDING FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES FOR THE PEOPLE OF OREGON WITH THE FORMATION OF A RESEARCH COMMUNITY ADVISORY NETWORK (RCAN) TO PROVIDE INPUT TO THE OAES ON CURRENT AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY, FACULTY MEMBERS UTILIZE CRITICAL DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC DATA, AND EXAMINE CURRENT RESEARCH FINDINGS TO IDENTIFY SOCIETAL NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS. PROGRAMMING IS THEN PLANNED BASED ON INPUT WITHIN OAES, EXTERNAL ADVISORY GROUPS, AND IN EACH OTHER ACADEMIC COLLEGES/PROGRAMS (I.E. FORESTRY, AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES, HEALTH AND HUMAN SCIENCES) AND ASSOCIATED EXTENSION PROGRAMS.  INPUT IS SOLICITED BY OSUES THROUGH A STATEWIDE ADVISORY NETWORK KNOWN AS EXTENSION COMMUNITY ADVISORY NETWORK (ECAN) THAT DIRECTLY ADVISES THE VICE PROVOST FOR EXTENSION AND ENGAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR OF EXTENSION. THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING EACH OF OSUES\u2019S SEVEN PROGRAM AREAS (4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH, FORESTRY AND NATURAL RESOURCES, OPEN CAMPUS, OUTDOOR SCHOOL, AND SEA GRANT) AS WELL AS TWO COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM OREGON COUNTIES AS DETERMINED BY THE OSUES DIRECTOR.

ANDREIA ARRUDA RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS CAUSED BY ORNITHOBACTERIUM RHINOTRACHEALIS (ORT) AND PASTEURELLA MULTOCIDA (PM) BACTERIA ARE SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO THE POULTRY INDUSTRY BY CAUSING ECONOMIC LOSSES AND WELFARE ISSUES. DUE TO CHARACTERIZATION DIFFICULTIES AND UNDERUTILIZATION OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TOOLS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL SPREAD OF BACTERIAL SUBTYPES FOR THESE DISEASES IN THE FIELD. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS RETROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY ARE TO A) DESCRIBE MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION AND SPACE-TIME PATTERNS FOR ORT AND PM USING ISOLATES COLLECTED FROM OUTBREAKS ON POULTRY FARMS; B) INVESTIGATE THE EXISTENCE OF SPATIAL CLUSTERS (HOTSPOTS) FOR ORT AND PM; AND C) INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GENETIC SIMILARITY AND SPATIAL PROXIMITY FOR BOTH ORT AND PM. ANALYSIS WILL BE DONE SEPARATELY FOR EACH BACTERIA. WE USED A UNIQUELY DEVELOPED CORE-GENOME MULTI-LOCUS SEQUENCING TYPING (CGMLST) SCHEME FOR ORT AND PM CHARACTERIZATION AND SUCCESSFULLY SEQUENCED AND CHARACTERIZED 103 ORT AND 81 PM ISOLATES COLLECTED FROM POULTRY FARMS DURING CONFIRMED DISEASE OUTBREAKS BETWEEN 2013-2021. TO CONTINUE THIS WORK AND ACCOMPLISH THE PROPOSED OBJECTIVES, CLUSTER ANALYSIS (SATSCAN) AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSES (QGIS) WILL BE CONDUCTED. WHEN COMPLETED, THIS STUDY WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST TO COMBINE ORT AND PM ISOLATE CHARACTERIZATION WITH SPATIAL-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS IN POULTRY IN THE U.S. AND DESCRIBE WHETHER LOCAL SPREAD IS IMPORTANT FOR THOSE BACTERIAL PATHOGENS. DATA FROM THIS STUDY WILL INCREASE THE UNDERSTANDING OF ORT AND PM PATHOGEN DIVERSITY AND LOCAL PATHOGEN PLASTICITY IN CONFIRMED OUTBREAKS. THIS ADDED INFORMATION WILL DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TOOLS IN COMBINATION WITH DATA ALREADY COLLECTED BY PRODUCERS BUT RARELY SHARED. A SUCCESSFUL STUDY MAY ALSO HELP RECRUIT ADDITIONAL POULTRY PRODUCERS AND COMPANIES IN DEVELOPING AN ONLINE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR ORT AND PM OUTBREAKS BY SHARING AND UTILIZING ROUTINELY COLLECTED HEALTH DATA. FINALLY, INCREASED KNOWLEDGE REGARDING ORT AND PM MAY LEAD TO IMPROVED BIOSECURITY PROTOCOLS AND VACCINATION SCHEMES. CURRENTLY, HIGHLY PATHOGENIC AVIAN INFLUENZA OUTBREAKS ARE HAPPENING ACROSS THE U.S. THIS IS A CONCERNING DEVELOPMENT FOR THE POULTRY INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. THE ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS AND PREVENT FUTURE EPIDEMICS IS PARAMOUNT BUT REQUIRES INCREASED DATA SHARING AND SOPHISTICATED ANALYSES TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF HOW DISEASES ARE TRANSMITTED. THE ABILITY FOR PRODUCERS TO SHARE DISEASE STATUS AND VISUALIZE DISEASE TRANSMISSION IN REAL-TIME ON A JOINT POULTRY INDUSTRY PLATFORM IS CURRENTLY LACKING. THE GOAL OF OUR PROJECT IS TO UTILIZE 8 YEARS' WORTH OF RETROSPECTIVE ORNITHOBACTERIUM RHINOTRACHEALIS AND PASTEURELLA MULTOCIDA BACTERIA OUTBREAK DATA TO MODEL THEIR GENOMIC AND SPATIAL PATTERNS OVER TIME IN THE FIELD.

IN THE BEEF CATTLE INDUSTRY, SICKNESS DUE TO DISEASES (SUCH AS BOVINE RESPIRATORY DISEASE) COSTS THE UNITED STATES BEEF INDUSTRY MORE THAN $900 MILLION PER YEAR IN LOST REVENUE. DISEASE OCCURRENCE IS MOSTLY DURING HANDLING AND TRANSPORTATION OF WEANED CALVES TO A FEEDLOT, BECAUSE DURING TRANSPORTATION THE ANIMALS ARE STRESSED AT A TIME WHEN EXPOSURE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES IS VERY HIGH (DUE TO CO-MINGLING AND CONTACT WITH OTHER SICK ANIMALS). SICK CATTLE ARE COMMONLY TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS TO REDUCE FEVER, BUT CONSUMER PRESSURE TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF ANTIBIOTIC AND OTHER DRUGS IN THE CATTLE FEEDING INDUSTRY DEMANDS THE EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ANIMAL HEALTH. IT IS WELL D OCUMENTED THAT AN ACTIVATED IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS AN INCREASED NUTRIENT DEMAND, AND THAT SUPPLEMENTATION OF SPECIFIC IMMUNE SUPPORTIVE NUTRIENTS IMPROVES FEEDLOT RECEIVING CATTLE HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR NUTRIENTS TO SUPPORT AN ACTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM TYPICALLY OCCURS WHEN CATTLE ARE UNDER STRESS.

IN THE FIRST WEEKS OF LIFE, THE BOVINE NEONATE\u2019S ABILITY TO FIGHT OFF PATHOGENS IS THEREFORE FULLY DEPENDENT UPON INGESTING COLOSTRUM (THE FIRST MILK PRODUCED BY FEMALE MAMMALS). THIS TRANSFER OF PASSIVE IMMUNITY IS CRUCIAL FOR THE NEWBORNS\u2019 SURVIVAL DURING THE FIRST WEEKS OF LIFE, WHICH ARE THE MOST CHALLENGING PERIOD TO ENTERIC INFECTIONS. IN THIS SCENARIO, BOVINE RESPIRATORY DISEASE COMPLEX (A COMBINATION OF STRESS, VIRAL, AND BACTERIAL INFECTIONS) IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF MORTALITY IN NEONATAL CALVES. IN ADDITION TO ANTIBODIES AND NUTRITIONAL FACTORS (I.E., FAT, PROTEIN, MINERALS), COLOSTRUM CONTAINS A VARIETY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS INCLUDING GROWTH FACTORS, CYTOKINES, MILK MICROBIOTA, AND RECENTLY MICRORNAS (MIRNAS) HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE COLOSTRUM COMPOSITION LIST. MICRORNAS ARE SMALL NON\u2010CODING RNA MOLECULES, WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN REGULATING MRNA EXPRESSION AND PROTEIN TRANSCRIPTION. ADDITIONALLY, THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS DISEASE STATES AND MAY HAVE A ROLE IN IMMUNE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION.

OUR PLAN OF WORK RELEVANT TO ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING SEVERAL CRITICAL ISSUES IN THE STATE. NEVADAS NUMBER ONE AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY IS ITS LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY AND IN PARTICULAR, BEEF CATTLE. IMPROVING THE GENERAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OF DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK AND OTHER INCOMEPRODUCING ANIMALS ESSENTIAL TO THE NATIONS FOOD SUPPLY AND THE WELFARE OF PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS OF THESE ANIMAL PRODUCTS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR NEVADA. COMPETING INTERESTS PRESENT CHALLENGES TO THE GENERAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OF DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE ON NEVADAS RANGELANDS AND FORESTS/WOODLANDS. DROUGHT, EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURES AND WILDFIRES IN NEVADA AND THE GREAT BASIN HAVE GREATLY REDUCED AVAILABLE FORAGE AND WATER IN THESE AREAS. WILD HORSE POPULATIONS AT 2 TO 3 TIMES APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT LEVELS HAVE ALSO GREATLY IMPACTED AVAILABLE RESOURCES. THESE RESOURCE LIMITATIONS GREATLY IMPACT THE WELFARE OF DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS AND THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE LIVESTOCK. STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS ISSUES AND TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO SUPPORT A HEALTHY BALANCE BETWEEN DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK, WILDLIFE AND WILD HORSE POPULATIONS. STUDIES WILL ALSO BE CONDUCTED TO DEVELOP BREEDS BETTER SUITED TO THE HARSH ENVIRONMENTS OF THE WEST WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE GENERAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OF THESE DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK. TRANSMISSION OF DISEASE BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND WILD SHEEP IS A CONCERN IN NEVADA AND THE GREAT BASIN. THE CONCERN OF TRANSMISSION OF VARIOUS DISEASES TO WILD SHEEP FROM DOMESTIC SHEEP HAVE GREATLY REDUCED LAND AVAILABLE FOR DOMESTIC SHEEP GRAZING. STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DEVELOP NEWER BREEDS AND BETTER MANAGE BREEDS OF DOMESTIC SHEEP IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE TRANSMISSION OF DISEASES FROM DOMESTIC SHEEP TO WILD SHEEP.

THE ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE RESEARCH PROGRAM IS ALIGNED WITH TWO SPECIFIC STRATEGIC GOALS FROM THE USDA STRATEGIC PLAN FOR FY 2022\u20102026. THESE USDA STRATEGIC GOALS ARE AS FOLLOWS: ENSURE AMERICA\u2019S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM IS EQUITABLE, RESILIENT AND PROSPEROUS; PROVIDE ALL AMERICANS SAFE, NUTRITIOUS FOOD. ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: IN THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA\u2010LINCOLN (UNL) INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES (IANR), WE ARE ALL ABOUT PEOPLE AND THE FOOD, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAT SUSTAIN THEM. IANR INNOVATION IN RESEARCH, TEACHING, AND EXTENSION EDUCATION PLACES NEBRASKA ON THE LEADING EDGE OF FOOD PRODUCTION, ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, HUMAN NUTRITION, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT. COMPOSED OF THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES AND NATURAL RESOURCES (CASNR), THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH DIVISION (ARD), NEBRASKA EXTENSION, AND THE ARD AND EXTENSION COMPONENTS OF THREE DEPARTMENTS IN THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND HUMAN SCIENCES; IANR IS COMMITTED TO GROWING THE FUTURE OF NEBRASKA'S PEOPLE, BUSINESSES, AND COMMUNITIES. STRATEGIC PLANNING IS INTEGRAL TO IANR'S FUNCTION AS A LAND\u2010GRANT INSTITUTION, AND IT PRIDES ITSELF ON WORKING AS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT ACROSS THE THREE MISSION AREAS. IANR STRIVES TO COMBINE RESEARCH, TEACHING AND EXTENSION IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY, COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT ENCOURAGES THE BEST THINKING AND EXPERTISE FROM ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TO ENSURE NEBRASKA\u2019S COMPETITIVENESS IN A WORLD OF CHANGE AND CHALLENGE. SPECIFIC TO ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE, IANR RESEARCH ADDRESSES HEALTH AND DISEASE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST PRESLAUGHTER OR PRE\u2010COLLECTION OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS (PRE\u2010HARVEST). ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE RESEARCH COMPRISES BASIC AND APPLIED STUDIES ON INFECTIOUS AND NONINFECTIOUS AGENTS WHICH IMPAIR THE NORMAL STATE OF THE LIVING ANIMAL BODY AND/OR THAT AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF VITAL FUNCTIONS. THIS INCLUDES RESEARCH TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AQUATIC ANIMALS AND OTHER INCOME PRODUCING ANIMALS AND TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE PREVENTION OF DISEASES IN BOTH DOMESTICATED AND WILD ANIMALS WHICH, IF NOT CONTROLLED, WOULD ENDANGER THE LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY INDUSTRIES. ALSO INCLUDED IS RESEARCH TO MINIMIZE TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING LOSSES; MONITOR THE SUITABILITY OF ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE; PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGH CONTROL OF ANIMAL DISEASES TRANSMISSIBLE TO HUMANS AND IMPROVE METHODS OF CONTROLLING THE REPRODUCTION OF PREDATORS. INVESTIGATIONS OF METABOLIC DISEASES AND REPRODUCTIVE DISEASES INCLUDING ENDOCRINE DYSFUNCTIONS SUCH AS ANESTRUS ARE INCLUDED. DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES: DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES FROM ACTIVE ANIMAL HEALTH PROJECTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 1. GENERATE FERRITIN NANOCAGES DISPLAYING THE HETEROTRIMERIC COMPLEX GP2A\u2010GP3\u2010GP4 AND HETERODIMERIC COMPLEX GP5\u2010M SEPARATELY AND TEST THEIR EFFICACY INDUCING POTENT AND LONG LASTING PROTECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES IN PIGS. GENERATE NANOCAGES DISPLAYING BOTH THE HETEROTRIMERIC AND HETERODIMERIC COMPLEXES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND TESTING THEIR EFFICACY IN GENERATING LONG LASTING PROTECTION. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THIS INNOVATIVE STRATEGY WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OVER THE CONVENTIONAL SUBUNIT VACCINES IN INDUCING HIGHLY EFFICACIOUS, POTENT, AND LASTING NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY RESPONSES FOR PROTECTION OF PIGS. 2. TO DEVELOP NOVEL AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION STRATEGIES TO CONTROL PRRSV INFECTION OF SWINE. IN STEPS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL, WE WILL FIRST DESCRIBE 1) THE DYNAMICS OF PRRSV INFECTION OF PAMS, 2) THE COMPRESSIVE LIST OF DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED IN THE DIFFERENT SUB\u2010POPULATIONS OF MACROPHAGES (INFECTED VS NON\u2010INFECTED) WITHIN INDIVIDUAL PRRSV INFECTED PIGS AND 3) THE POTENTIAL ROLES OF THE TOP DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES IN PRRSV INFECTION. 3. CONDUCTING GENOMIC RESEARCH THAT WILL LEAD TO 1) IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL PATHOGENS AND DEVELOPMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES, 2) IN VIVO AND IN VITRO MODELS TO TEST GENES ASSOCIATED WITH VIRAL DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND 3) ALTERNATIVE MOLECULAR SOLUTIONS FOR BREEDING AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS IN LIVESTOCK. 4. UNDERSTANDING OF GENOTYPIC AND PHENOTYPIC DIVERSITY OF CIRCULATING OPPORTUNISTIC BACTERIAL PATHOGENS. IDENTIFICATION OF GENOTYPES ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL DISEASE AND ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE. TRANSLATION OF GENOTYPES AND PHENOTYPES INTO ASSESSABLE BIOMARKERS TO ENHANCE PATHOGEN CHARACTERIZATION. DEVELOPMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THAT FACILITATE RAPID AND HIGH THROUGHPUT TESTING OF PATHOGEN TYPES SUCH AS AMR AND IDENTIFICATION OF VIRULENCE AND POTENTIAL VACCINE TARGETS.

SEVERAL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES ARE CORRELATED TO THE DIMENSIONALITY OF THE CELLULAR MICROENVIRONMENT AND ARE DEPENDENT ON CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SURROUNDING SUBSTRATE. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT SEVERAL ASPECTS OF CELLULAR AND TISSUE LEVEL FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED ON 2-D SUBSTRATES MAY INDEED CHANGE WHEN CELLS HAVE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A COMPLEX 3-D NETWORK. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT HAVE DELAYED A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING FOR TREATING BOVINE RESPIRATORY DISEASES DUE TO BACTERIAL AND VIRAL INFECTION, BOVINE METRITIS, AND UNDERSTANDING ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY IN VIVO IS THE LACK OF PHYSIOLOGICALLY-RELEVANT 3-D TISSUE CULTURES TO OBTAIN FUNDAMENTAL INSIGHTS INTO HOW PATHOGENS HARM CELLS.

MEDIUM IS ADDED TO EACH WELL AND THE PLATE MAINTAINED IN A HUMIDIFIED ENVIRONMENT OF 5% CO2 AT 38.5\u00b0C. EACH DAY TRANS-EPITHELIAL ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE (TEER) MEASUREMENTS ARE CONDUCTED TO MEASURE THEIR DIFFERENTIATION. WHEN THE TEER VALUES REACH 200 WCM2, THE CULTURE MEDIUM IS CHANGED TO A FORMULATION CONTAINING EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR, RETINOIC ACID, AND BOVINE PITUITARY EXTRACT TO PROMOTE EPITHELIALIZATION. WHEN THE TEER VALUES EXCEED 500 WCM2, THE CULTURE MEDIUM FROM APICAL CHAMBER WILL BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO EXPOSE THE CELLS TO AIR AND FORM A 3-D CELL LAYER IN THE AIR-LIQUID INTERFACE. THE CULTURES WILL BE MAINTAINED UP TO 3 WEEKS PRIOR TO USE IN DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS, SUCH AS BIOFILM FORMATION BY ANIMAL PATHOGENS.

IN THE 2023-2027 PERIOD, THE STATION EXPECTS TO SUPPORT BETWEEN 44 AND 50 RESEARCH PROJECTS ACROSS FIVE CRITICAL ISSUES\u2014AGRICULTURE; CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINING NATURAL RESOURCES; FOOD SAFETY; NUTRITION, HEALTH, AND WELLNESS; AND RURAL COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\u2014AS WELL AS PROJECTS WITHIN THE MCINTIRE-STENNIS FORESTRY SCIENCE AREAS. WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE AREA, RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES, PROCESSES AND DELIVERS FOOD, FIBER, AND MYRIAD ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON BIOTECHNOLOGICAL AND MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN CROP AND DAIRY PRODUCTION TO MINIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKET RISKS AND CAPTURING NEW MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES. RESEARCH HERE IS EXPECTED TO GROW WITH THE RECENT HIRING OF A CROP BREEDER FACULTY. FOCUS WILL ALSO BE PLACED ON HELPING THE STATE AND REGION CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY TO BENEFIT THE BLUE ECONOMY. WORK WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO TARGET ISSUES RELATED TO MITIGATING AND ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE AS A SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THROUGH BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCE, AN EMERGING AREA OF EXCELLENCE IS IN SOIL MICROBIOLOGY, AND THESE EFFORTS WILL BE ONE OF THE CORE OF THE NHAES RESEARCH MISSION IN CLIMATE SCIENCE. A SECOND CORE AREA IS IN WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WATER AND AGRICULTURAL LAND AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. FOOD SAFETY IS AN AREA IN WHICH LESS RESEARCH IS EXPECTED THAN IN THE PAST. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH THAT WILL CONTINUE WILL FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE GROWING AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO MANAGING PATHOGENS IN SHELLFISH. DIFFERENTIATING STRAINS OF PATHOGENS AND PREDICTING NEW STRAINS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT THE NORTHEAST AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY MAINTAINS ITS HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS. RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO GROW IN THE NUTRITION AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS AREAS, AS EARLY-CAREER FACULTY TRANSITION INTO BEING MORE EXPERIENCED SCIENTISTS AND NEW FACULTY ARE ONBOARDED. THE FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH WILL BE ON IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENSURING NUTRITIONAL BALANCE AND HEALTH OF UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS IN NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND. THIS INCLUDES REFUGEE, IMMIGRANT, AND LATINX POPULATIONS, WHICH HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW IN SIZE IN THE REGION. CONSIDERATIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THESE POPULATIONS' EATING HABITS, MICROBIOME COMPOSITIONS, AND NUTRITIONAL BEHAVIORS WILL HELP INFORM SCIENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS. LASTLY, AS NEW HAMPSHIRE'S COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE DEMOGRAPHICALLY AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY, NHAES RESEARCH WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS PART OF ITS RESEARCH PORTFOLIO ON CHARACTERIZING THOSE TRENDS, THE IMPACTS OF THOSE TRENDS, AND HOW LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS CAN BE BEST DEVELOPED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND SUPPORT THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE AND REGION. USING SCIENCE-BASED, DATA-DRIVEN METHODS TO IDENTIFY KEY FACTORS STRESSING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDING RESEARCH-INFORMED RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE INDIVIDUAL, FIRM, MUNICIPALITY, AND STATE LEVELS ARE CRUCIAL FOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY. THE NHAES WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO GROW ITS OUTREACH AND SCIENCE COMMUNICATION PROGRAM.

AREAS OF INTEREST: DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES, MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. PI: ALONSO GUEDES GUEDE003@UMN.EDU, CO IS: TROY TRUMBLE, CATHY CARLSON BACKGROUND/PROBLEM:  OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS HIGHLY PREVALENT IN ANIMALS AND HUMANS;  THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR THERAPIES THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY MITIGATE OA ASSOCIATED PAIN, DISABILITY AND JOINT PATHOLOGY;  A THERAPY WITH THESE QUALITIES WOULD HAVE A HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT IN BOTH ANIMAL AND HUMAN HEALTH/MEDICINE. OBJECTIVE: TO ELUCIDATE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TWO COX ISOFORMS (COX 1 AND COX 2) AND SEH IN APOPTOSIS OF EQUINE PRIMARY ARTICULAR CHONDROCYTES AND (II) THEIR EFFECTS ON REACTIVITY OF PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS. RESEARCH PLAN: WE WILL USE CULTURED PRIMARY EQUINE ARTICULAR CHONDROCYTES AND PERIPHERAL SENSORY NEURONS OBTAINED FROM MICE. HOW/WHY IS THE RESEARCH TEAM UNIQUELY QUALIFIED? A STRONG MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM (ANESTHESIOLOGIST, EQUINE SURGEON, PATHOLOGIST) WITH ROBUST PRELIMINARY IN VIVO AND IN VITRO DATA TO SUPPORT OUR HYPOTHESES.  BENEFITS OF PROPOSED RESEARCH/ EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND IMPACT:  WE BELIEVE, BASED ON STRONG PRELIMINARY DATA, THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN SEH THE COX ISOFORMS IN MEDIATING CHONDROCYTE APOPTOSIS AND HYPERREACTIVITY OF SENSORY NEURONS IN ORDER TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL ANALGESIC THERAPY FOR OA. SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL VERTICALLY ADVANCE THE MOST COMMON OA THERAPY, WHICH IS BASED ON COX INHIBITION ALONE BUT IS OFTEN INADEQUATE FOR PAIN RELIEF, HAVE NO DISEASE MODIFYING EFFECT AND CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS. IF YOURE SUCCESSFUL, WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL YOUR RESULTS MAKE?  OUR RESULTS WILL SUPPORT FUTURE GRANT APPLICATIONS TO DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF NATURALLY OCCURRING OA IN HORSES AND POSSIBLY OTHER SPECIES. WHAT ARE THE RISKS?  THERE IS SOME RISK THAT DATA OBTAINED IN CELL CULTURES MAY NOT ENTIRELY RECAPITULATE THE NATURALLY OCCURRING DISEASE. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THIS RISK TO BE SMALL BASED ON OUR EXTENSIVE PRELIMINARY DATA SUPPORTING AN INTERACTION BETWEEN SEH AND COX IN BOTH MICE AND HORSES  PICTURE OR GRAPHIC THAT ILLUSTRATES THE RESEARCH OR CONCEPT: ARACHIDONIC ACID (AA) METABOLISM VIA THE CYCLOOXYGENASE (COX) AND SOLUBLE EPOXIDE HYDROLASE (SEH) PATHWAYS. SEH BREAKS DOWN BENEFICIAL EPOXYEICOSATRIENOIC ACIDS (EETS), GENERATED BY EPOXYGENASES (CYP450) FROM AA, TO THEIR CORRESPONDING HARMFUL DIHYDROXYEICOSATRIENOIC ACID (DIHETS). COX ACTIVITY RESULT IN PRODUCTION OF PROSTAGLANDINS (PG) AND THROMBOXANES (TX). THESE METABOLITES INTERACT IN COOPERATIVE AND OPPOSING WAYS TO REGULATE CELLULAR ACTIVITY, THAT CAN BE MODULATED BY COMBINED INHIBITION OF COX AND SEH.

THE FIRST IS SUPPORT FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH T RAINING OF PROFESSIONAL (DVM) STUDENTS IN RESEARCH RELEVANT TO THE STATED USDA OBJECTIVES. THE SECOND RELATES TO DIRECTLY SUPPORTING RESEARCH THAT IMPROVES THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF USDA TARGET SPECIES. THESE SEPARATE INITIATIVES ARE DETAILED BELOW: SHORT TERM TRAINING OF DVM STUDENTS: VETERINARIANS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN SAFEGUARDING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING FOOD ANIMALS, ENSURING THE SAFETY OF THESE ANIMALS, AND WORKING WITH FARMERS/PRODUCERS IN RURAL SETTINGS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT IN AREAS OF UNMET NEED. ONGOING CHALLENGES EXIST WITH RESPECT TO SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS WORKFORCE AS INCREASINGLY DVM STUDENTS AND NEW GRADUATE VETERINARIANS ARE MIGRATING INTO SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICES, THUS CONSTRAINING THE POOL OF QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX INTERDEPENDENCE OF ANIMAL, HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, AND THE EVOLVING COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, IT IS BECOMING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE THE DVM STUDENT POPULATION TO CONSIDER ALTERNATE CAREERS. TO ADDRESS THIS SPECIFIC NEED, WE PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR 2-4 DVM STUDENTS TO UNDERTAKE RESEARCH OVER THE SUMMER, PERFORMING STUDIES RELEVANT FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY AND HEALTH OF FOOD/FIBER ANIMAL SPECIES. THESE STUDENTS SPEND 12 WEEKS IMMERSED IN THEIR SPECIFIC PROJECT, AND MOST WILL PRESENT THEIR FINDINGS AT THE NATIONAL VETERINARY SCHOLARS SYMPOSIUM. IMPORTANTLY, ALL STUDENTS UNDERTAKING USDA SUPPORTED RESEARCH PRESENT A POSTER AT THE TUFTS CUMMINGS ANNUAL RESEARCH DAY AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER. ATTENDANCE AT RESEARCH DAY IS MANDATORY FOR ALL INCOMING FIRST YEAR AND CONTINUING SECOND YEAR DVM STUDENTS, WITH THE GOAL OF MAXIMIZING EXPOSURE TO RESEARCH AND ALTERNATIVE CAREER PATHS VERY EARLY IN THEIR TRAINING. RESEARCH RELEVANT TO FOOD/FIBER SPECIES: OVER THE PAST DECADE, IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THE MICROBIOTA IN THE INTESTINE, LUNGS, SKIN, AND OTHER ORGANS PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN REGULATING DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITIES. HOWEVER, VERY LITTLE IS CURRENTLY KNOWN REGARDING HOW THIS IS AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL INFLUENCES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WITH RESPECT TO THE INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA, A COMMUNITY OF BILLIONS OF MICROORGANISMS, WITHIN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. THIS MICROBIOTA MOSTLY CONSISTS OF BACTERIA AND PERFORMS METABOLIC FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR DIGESTING NUTRIENTS AND REGULATING THE IMMUNE RESPONSE. WITH THE ADVENT OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY IS HAS BECOME FEASIBLE TO SEQUENCE THE DNA OF COMPLEX MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES. THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN USED TO INVESTIGATE A MULTITUDE OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE GUT MICROBIOTA AND THE HOST. BASED ON RESEARCH PERFORMED IN HUMANS, IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT HEALTH INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA CAN PROVIDE \u201cCOLONIZATION RESISTANCE\u201d AND PREVENT AGAINST OTHER ENTERIC PATHOGENS (I.E., BAD BACTERIA THAT CAUSE DIARRHEA AND WASTING, COLIC,AMONG OTHERS). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH HEALTHY MICROBIOTA CAN IMPROVE CRITICAL IMMUNE FUNCTIONS THAT PROTECT AGAINST OTHER PATHOGENS. INDEED, TRANSPLANTATION OF HEALTHY MICROBIOTA SPECIES HAS BECOME A RECOGNIZED THERAPEUTIC APPROACH IN HUMANS TO ADDRESS A MULTITUDE OF DISORDERS. WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ANIMAL DISEASES, WE KNOW FAR LESS ABOUT  WHAT IS CONSIDERED A HEALTHY MICROBIOTA AND WHICH SPECIES OF BACTERIA ARE LIKELY TO BE CRITICAL FOR MAINTAINING THIS HEALTHY STATE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE OVERRIDING GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE FECAL MICROBIOTA IN TWO KEY SPECIES, ALPACAS AND RABBITS. WE WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS (ENVIRONMENT, PARASITE LOAD, ETC.) ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE MICROBIOTA USING ADVANCED GENOMICS AND MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES. WE WILL DETERMINE IF SPECIFIC CHANGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SUSCEPTIBILITIES TO OTHER SECONDARY CONDITIONS (I.E., INFECTION, WEIGHT LOSS, ETC.). LASTLY, WE WILL WORK TO IDENTIFY METHODOLOGIES THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE MICROBIOTA (I.E., PROBIOTICS, PREBIOTICS, FECAL TRANSPLANTATION) WITH THE GOAL OF RESTORING THE COMPOSITION OF GUT BACTERIA TO A HEALTHY STATE. ULTIMATELY, BY PERFORMING THESE STUDIES, WE ANTICIPATE GENERATING A SET OF TECHNOLOGIES AND RESOURCES THAT WILL HAVE BROAD APPLICABILITY TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF ALPACAS AND RABBITS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

THE KSRE NETWORK INCLUDES OFFICES IN ALL 105 COUNTIES, ALONG WITH FOUR REGIONAL EXTENSION OFFICES, FIVE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENCOMPASS VARIABILITY IN CLIMATE AND SOILS, FOUR SATELLITE UNITS, FOUR AGRONOMY EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND FOUR HORTICULTURE CENTERS AND EXPERIMENT FIELDS. IN ADDITION, KSRE FUNDS RESEARCH PROJECTS IN 20 DEPARTMENTS ACROSS FIVE COLLEGES. A UNIQUE FEATURE WITHIN THE K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION ORGANIZATION IS THE CLOSE ALIGNMENT OF RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. IN 1996, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION WAS FORMED BY ALIGNING THE KANSAS AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (KAES) AND THE KANSAS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE. THE STRATEGIC INTENT OF THIS ALIGNMENT WAS TO ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCY AND SYNERGY BETWEEN DISCOVERY AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. ONE ANCILLARY BENEFIT OF THIS ALIGNMENT IS THAT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO RAPID EXTENSION PROGRAMMING AND APPLICATION IN THE FIELD. THIS ALIGNMENT ALSO ALLOWS MORE FLUID COMPLIANCE WITH MULTI-STATE AND INTEGRATED COMPONENTS OF AREERA. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSING ITS EFFORTS ON FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES (CRITICAL ISSUES) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT ALL KANSANS: GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES, HEALTH, DEVELOPING TOMORROW'S LEADERS, AND COMMUNITY VITALITY. THESE GRAND CHALLENGES WERE DETERMINED THROUGH A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND DEFINE AREAS OF EMPHASIS FOR AGENTS, SPECIALISTS, AND RESEARCHERS. EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS AT THE LOCAL, REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL WORK TO DEVELOP REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE SIGNATURE PROGRAMS ALONG WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS MEMBERS THROUGH 11 PROGRAM FOCUS TEAMS \u2013 ADULT DEVELOPMENT AND AGING; COMMUNITY VITALITY; CROP PRODUCTION; FAMILY AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT; FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; FARM MANAGEMENT; HORTICULTURE; LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; NATURAL RESOURCES; NUTRITION, FOOD SAFETY AND HEALTH; AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, TWO TRANSDISCIPLINARY TEAMS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS COMPLEX ISSUES TO KANSANS - LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS AND STRESS AND RESILIENCY. THE WORK OF THESE TEAMS FALLS WITHIN THE OVERALL UMBRELLA OF THE FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CANNOT SOLVE THESE CHALLENGES ALONE. KSRE'S STATEWIDE PRESENCE LENDS ITSELF TO COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH ORGANIZATIONS, PRIVATE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY, LOCAL GROUPS, STATE AND FEDERAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES. QUALITY FACULTY DRAW BUSINESSES AND FUNDING TO K-STATE AND TO KANSAS INCLUDING: - K-STATE IS THE ONLY UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD WITH ACCESS TO A FULL CONTINUUM OF BIOSECURITY LABORATORIES LOCATED ON OR ADJACENT TO CAMPUS. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE WILL PROVIDE PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSTICS, RESEARCH, SURVEILLANCE, AND TRAINING IN DISEASE VECTOR BIOLOGY. THE LABORATORIES WILL OFFER EMERGENCY RAPID TESTING AND MANUFACTURING TO PROTECT THE NATION'S ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SUPPLY DURING A CRISIS. - KANSAS PRIDE IS DEDICATED TO SERVING COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND VOLUNTEERS IN MAKING THEIR COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK. THE KANSAS PRIDE PROGRAM IS A PARTNERSHIP OF K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION, THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, KANSAS MASONS AND KANSAS PRIDE, INC. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, LOCAL COMMUNITIES IDENTIFY WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO PRESERVE, CREATE, OR IMPROVE FOR THEIR FUTURE. THEN, WORKING WITH THE RESOURCES OF K-STATE RESEARCH <(>&<)> EXTENSION AND THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS PULL TOGETHER TO CREATE THEIR IDEAL COMMUNITY FUTURE.  - EXTENSION\u2019S RESEARCH CENTERS, EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND HIGHLY SKILLED SCIENTISTS AND STAFF, COMBINED WITH THE CLIMATE AND SOIL VARIABILITY ACROSS THE STATE, PROVIDE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND CORPORATE AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. - FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES IS A PARTNER OF THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT FOR AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE EDUCATION TO MEDICARE ELIGIBLE KANSANS. APPROXIMATELY 1/3 OF THE CONTACTS OF THOSE SERVED ARE VULNERABLE BENEFICIARIES WITH INCOMES BELOW 150% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL. - KANSAS 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WAS AWARDED A CONTRACT BY THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR $4.2 MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE SUMMERS TO PROVIDE HANDS-ON, PROJECT-BASED 4-H SUMMER PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS COVID-19-RELATED LEARNING LOSS IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUILDING UPON THE LONG RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LEVERAGING THE STATE'S LARGEST YOUTH DEVELOPMENT NETWORK REACHING ALL 105 COUNTIES, KANSAS 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WILL USE SUMMER ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF YOUTH AS A PART OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN \u2014 ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF PLAN. - K-STATE - IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FOUR OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND SEVERAL INDUSTRY PARTNERS HAVE JOINED EFFORTS TO CREATE THE IRRIGATION I NNOVATION CONSORTIUM, A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH EFFORT TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF EFFICIENT IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES. - K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION WILL ADDRESS THE HEALTH OF KANSANS THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL COOPERATIVE EXTENSION\u2019S FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH EQUITY AND WELL-BEING WHICH INCLUDES A FOCUS ON HEALTH EQUITY, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND COALITIONS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSETS. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF KANSAS CONTINUE TO CHANGE. KSRE IS REACHING OUT TO BOTH UNDERSERVED AND TRADITIONAL AUDIENCES THROUGH NEW VENUES. TO INCREASE MULTICULTURAL COMPETENCY AND SENSITIVITY AMONG OUR WORKFORCE, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION AND THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE/KSRE DIVERSITY PROGRAMS OFFICE PROVIDES REGULAR NAVIGATING DIFFERENCE TRAINING FOR NEW EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO BRING SYSTEMIC CHANGE AND DIVERSITY TO THE KSRE TEAM AND PROVIDE CULTURAL COMPETENCY AWARENESS AND SKILLS THAT THEY CAN PRACTICALLY APPLY IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY WORK. OTHER EFFORTS INCLUDE: - THE MULTICULTURAL UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM TARGETS UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS WITH THE GOAL TO ESTABLISH NETWORKING RELATIONSHIPS BACK TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOME INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS K-STATE FACULTY. THIS PROGRAM HAS A SPECIFIC GOAL OF GROWING THE MINORITY POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS WITHIN GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND ACROSS OTHER PARTNER COLLEGES REPRESENTED WITHIN K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. - LOCAL UNIT EXTENSION COUNCIL MEMBERS REVIEW PARITY STATISTICS ANNUALLY AND SPEND TIME DETERMINING STRATEGIC EFFORTS NECESSARY TO REACH UNDERSERVED AND AT-RISK AUDIENCES. - K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN AND SECURING SERVICES THROUGH LANGUAGE LINE SERVICES TO BRING GREATER ACCESS TO LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT AUDIENCES. - THIS FALL, A NEW COMMUNITY LIAISON WILL BE ON STAFF TO HELP LINK KSRE\u2019S RESOURCES TO THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN NORTHEAST KANSAS. GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS AS THE STATE'S LARGEST EMPLOYER, AGRICULTURE DRIVES THE KANSAS ECONOMY. IN 2020, THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTED $70.3 BILLION TO THE KANSAS ECONOMY. AGRICULTURE IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE, WITH 250,058 PEOPLE ACCOUNTING FOR 13 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE. WE ARE IMPROVING FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS TO FEED THE WORLD'S GROWING POPULATION, WHICH WILL ECONOMICALLY BENEFIT KANSAS. TO FEED AND SUSTAIN A GROWING POPULATION, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRACTICES TO HELP FARMERS, RANCHERS, AND AGRIBUSINESSES IMPROVE PROFITABILITY, EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY FOR KANSAS, OUR NATION, AND THE WORLD THROUGH CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH IN AREAS SUCH AS GENETICS, DISEASE PREVENTION, FOOD SECURITY AND FARM BILL EDUCATION.

IOWA ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE NATION\u2019S PIG INVENTORY AND MARKETS APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION PIGS PER YEAR, MAKING IT THE NUMBER ONE PIG PRODUCING STATE IN THE U.S. HOWEVER, THE PIGS RAISED IN IOWA ARE CONTINUOUSLY CHALLENGED BY INFECTIOUS DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH VERY COMMON ENDEMIC VIRAL AND BACTERIAL PATHOGENS. TO ADDRESS THIS, BETTER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES INCLUDING PREVENTION, TREATMENT OR CURE VIA NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF DISEASE IN GROWING PIGS IS A MAJOR RESEARCH FOCUS. WORK IS UNDERWAY TO UNDERSTAND THE NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF PIGS PRONE TO DISEASE PRESSURES WITHIN IOWA TO ENABLE GREATER GROWTH PERFORMANCE AND WELLBEING. FURTHER, THE WORK WILL UTILIZE PIGS FROM POOR HEALTH (DISEASE CHALLENGED), WHICH ARE OFTENOVERLOOKED IN RESEARCH, TO STUDY NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT AND THE LONGITUDINAL IMPACTS OF DISEASE IN WEAN-TO-FINISH PIGS. THE RATIONALE IS THAT PIGS RAISED IN IOWA ARE CONTINUOUSLY CHALLENGED BY INFECTIOUS DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH VERY COMMON ENDEMIC PATHOGENS. TWO OBJECTIVES WILL BE COMPLETED. THE FIRST WILL BE TO EVALUATE NUTRITIONAL STRATEGIES TO ALLEVIATE ENTERIC AND RESPIRATORY HEALTH CHALLENGES IN COMMERCIAL NURSERY-GROWER PIGS. SECOND, THE IMPACT OF ENTERIC ROTAVIRUS RELATED DISEASE IN NEWLY WEANED PIGS ON NUTRIENT UTILIZATION WILL BE STUDIES. PIGS WILL BE SOURCED FROM ROTAVIRUS A AND C POSITIVE SOW FARMS AND NURSERY FLOWS, AND ALSO FROM FLOWS THAT ARE PRONE TO PATHOGENIC E. COLI, BUT ARE PRRS NEGATIVE. THESE HEALTH COMPROMISED PIGS REPRESENT THE \"TYPICAL\" NURSERY PIG RAISED IN IOWA TO SPECIFICALLY EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF ROTAVIRUS A AND C ON NURSERY PIGS. TOGETHER, THESE TWO CONTROLLED ROTAVIRUS STUDIES WILL IDENTIFY THE IMPACT ROTAVIRUS A AND C HAS ON NURSERY PIG DIGESTIBILITY, METABOLISM, AND GROWTH. THESE DATA CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO BETTER FEED AND MANAGE NURSERY PIGS INFECTED WITH ROTAVIRUS.  THE US POULTRY INDUSTRY IS A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY THAT ANNUALLY LOSES UP TO 15% OF ITS POTENTIAL INCOME DUE TO DISEASE. THESE ECONOMIC LOSSES ARE FROM MANY SOURCES, INCLUDING ANIMAL MORTALITY, HEALTH CARE COSTS, PRODUCT CONDEMNATION AND LOWER EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTION. ADDITIONALLY, SOME PATHOGENS THAT CAUSE DISEASE IN POULTRY CAN ALSO CAUSE HUMAN HEALTH RISKS FROM CONSUMPTION OF IMPROPERLY PREPARED, CONTAMINATED EGGS AND MEAT. IN 2015, DEVASTATING ECONOMIC AND ANIMAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF AVIAN DISEASE WAS BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT WITH THE OUTBREAK OF HIGH PATH AVIAN INFLUENZA IN THE US MIDWEST. IN 2019, VELOGENIC NEWCASTLE DISEASE OUTBREAKS OCCURRED IN BACKYARD AND COMMERCIAL FLOCKS IN THE US. THEREFORE, CONTROL OF DISEASE IN POULTRY IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO ENHANCE ANIMAL HEALTH AND WELFARE, ENSURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE U.S. POULTRY INDUSTRY, AND PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY. UNDERSTANDING THE IDENTITY, VARIATION AND FUNCTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS OF PROTEINS, GENES AND PATHWAYS THAT CONTROL RESPONSE TO POULTRY PATHOGENS WILL HELP PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR GENETIC IMPROVEMENT OF DISEASE RESISTANCE IN POULTRY VIA CLASSICAL GENETIC SELECTION TECHNIQUES, WHOLE-GENOME SELECTION, AND NATURAL REGULATORS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. ISU RESEARCHERS ARE APPLYING SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE BY USING CONTEMPORARY TECHNOLOGIES TO STUDY THE HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTION; THE WORK WILL MAINTAIN AND STUDY NOVEL LINES OF CHICKENS TO ENHANCE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY HOW CERTAIN BIRDS ARE BETTER AT RESISTING DISEASE. THE OVERALL GOAL IS TO ENHANCE HOST GENETIC RESISTANCE TO POULTRY PATHOGENS. ENHANCED HOST RESISTANCE WILL REDUCE THE NEED FOR ANTIBIOTIC USE AND WILL LOWER THE PATHOGEN BURDEN IN THE LIVE BIRD AND THEREBY IMPROVE ANIMAL HEALTH, PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY, PRE-HARVEST FOOD SAFETY AND HUMAN HEALTH. THE MAJOR GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO MAINTAIN AND SHARE UNIQUE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES FOR ANIMAL HEALTH RESEARCH, AND TO ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE GENETIC CONTROL OF IMMUNITY AND RESISTANCE TO PATHOGENS IN CHICKENS BY CHARACTERIZING NOVEL CHICKEN LINES. THE LONG-TERM AIM IS TO REDUCE THE OCCURRENCE AND NEGATIVE IMPACT OF DISEASES ON THE POULTRY INDUSTRY THROUGH SCIENCE-INFORMED CONTROL STRATEGIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO GENETICS. ONE AIM WILL BE TO MAINTAIN AND CHARACTERIZE THE BREEDING COLONY OF IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY CHICKEN GENETIC LINES OF UNIQUE IMMUNOLOGICAL PHENOTYPES AND GENETIC ARCHITECTURE. THE WORK WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE TRANSCRIPTOME RESPONSE OF SINGLE CELLS AND HETEROGENEOUS IMMUNE TISSUES OF CHICKENS OF DIVERSE GENETIC LINES TO IMPORTANT POULTRY PATHOGENS. THE RESULTS OF THIS WORK IS RELEVANT TO THE POULTRY INDUSTRY AND WILL HAVE POSITIVE AND LASTING IMPACTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF POULTRY, FOOD SECURITY AND FOOD SAFETY BY PROVIDING NOVEL, ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY, NON-ANTIBIOTIC, NON-GMO BASED STRATEGIESTO KNOWLEDGEABLY USE THE EXISTING BIODIVERSITY IN CHICKENS TO REDUCE MICROBIAL BURDENS IN THE LIVE BIRDS AND IN POULTRY MEAT AND EGGS.  ISU RESEARCHERS DISSEMINATE THE RESULTS OF THEIR WORK THROUGH PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATIONS, PUBLICATIONS IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS, EX TENSION PROGRAMS, WORKSHOPS AND PUBLICATIONS, PRESENTATIONS TO COMMODITY GROUPS AND MEMBERS, MEETINGS WITH FARMERS AND PRODUCERS, AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS. THESE AUDIENCES ARE PROVIDED WITH CURRENT INFORMATION FROM THE RESEARCH PROJECTS IN CONTEXT SO THAT IT CAN BE READILY APPLIED AND USED. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE WORK IS TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OF ANIMALS THROUGHOUT THE ECOSYSTEM, AND TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASES.

THE FIRST PROJECT IS AIMED AT IMPROVING DIAGNOSIS AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BOVINE RESPIRATORY DISEASE IN INDIANA. BOVINE RESPIRATORY DISEASE (BRD) IS THE GROUP OF DISEASES HAVING THE HIGHEST ECONOMIC IMPACT ON BEEF CATTLE IN NORTH AMERICA. IT IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN U.S. CATTLE FEEDLOTS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 50% OF ALL FEEDLOT DEATHS, ADDING TO THE COST OF TREATING BRD. TOTAL FINANCIAL LOSSES CAUSED BY BRD MOUNT TO $2 - 3 BILLION PER YEAR. BRD IS CAUSED BY DIFFERENT PATHOGENS INCLUDING VIRUSES AND BACTERIA. ALTHOUGH PATHOLOGIC CHANGES ARE SOMEWHAT DISTINCT AMONG DIFFERENT INFECTIOUS AGENTS, THERE IS ENOUGH OVERLAP THAT ANCILLARY TESTS ARE REQUIRED FOR DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS. MOREOVER, DIAGNOSTIC TESTS BASED ON NUCLEIC ACID DETECTION ARE MORE SENSITIVE AND PROVIDE A FASTER TURNAROUND. THE CHOICE OF DIAGNOSTIC METHODS IS BASED ON DIFFERENT PARAMETERS INCLUDING COST, SENSITIVITY,SPECIFICITY AND TEST COMPLEXITY. WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING THE BEST APPROACH TO DIAGNOSE BRD, THE SELECTION OF TESTS CHANGES OVER TIME. IN THIS STUDY, TRENDS IN BRD IN INDIANA HERDS WILL BE DETERMINED USING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND BASED ON RESULTS OBTAINED WITH PATHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AVAILABLE AT THE ANIMAL DISEASE DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS RESEARCH INCLUDE: (1) IDENTIFY PATHOGENS AFFECTING THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM OF DOMESTIC CATTLE; (2) DETERMINE THE TEMPORAL TREND IN DISTRIBUTION OF BOVINE RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS; AND (3) CORRELATE CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS WITH THE RESULTS OF MICROBIOLOGY, VIROLOGY, AND MOLECULAR TESTING. THIS WORK WILL INCREASE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT BOVINE RESPIRATORY INFECTIOUS AGENTS IN INDIANA HERDS WHICH IS CRITICAL TO PREVENTION OF INFECTIONS WITH PROPHYLACTIC AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES; INCREASE DIAGNOSTIC SUCCESS RATE DUE TO TEST SELECTION OPTIMIZATION; AND ENABLE DETECTION OF EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING PATHOGENS THAT CAUSE BRD. THE AUDIENCE INCLUDES FOOD ANIMAL VETERINARIANS AND BEEF AND DAIRY CATTLE FARMERS.

THE SECOND PROJECT FOCUSES ON EQUINE PROTOZOAL MYELOENCEPHALITIS (EPM), A NEUROLOGIC DISEASE CAUSED BY SARCOCYSTIS NEURONA THAT RESULTS IN HUGE ECONOMIC LOSSES TO THE EQUINE INDUSTRY. S. NEURONA INFECTS BETWEEN 15 AND 89% OF HORSES, BUT CLINICAL DISEASE DEVELOPS IN LESS THAN 1% OF THESE HORSES. THE PROGRESSION OF THIS NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE IS UNPREDICTABLE AND OFTEN TIMES REQUIRES PROLONGED TREATMENT WITH ANTIPROTOZOAL DRUGS THAT ARE EXPENSIVE. UNFORTUNATELY, ONLY 60-70% OF THE HORSES APPEAR TO RESPOND TO TREATMENT AND 10-20% OF THE HORSES EXPERIENCE RELAPSE OF CLINICAL SIGNS UPON CESSATION OF TREATMENT. SARCOCYSTIS NEURONA ESTABLISHES INFECTION WITHIN THE CELLS OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT UNDERSTANDING HOW S. NEURONA SURVIVES WITHIN, AND INTERACTS WITH THE HOST CELL WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO MOLECULAR MECHANISMS THAT COULD BE TARGETED TO PREVENT RELAPSE FROM OCCURRING. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO IDENTIFY KEY PARASITE PROTEINS THAT SUPPORT ITS INTRACELLULAR LIFESTYLE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOLECULAR GENETICS TOOLS THAT WILL ENABLE US TO DECIPHER THE BIOLOGICAL ROLE OF THESE PROTEINS. THESE EFFORTS WILL LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION OF PROTEINS (SECRETORY AND MEMBRANE) THAT ARE FUNCTIONAL DURING INTRACELLULAR DEVELOPMENT OF S. NEURONA, AND POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL DRUGS TO TREAT THESE INFECTIONS. THE IMMEDIATE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS WORK WILL BE OTHER SCIENTISTS IN ACADEMIC AND ANIMAL HEALTH COMPA NIES.

PRODUCTION SYSTEMS FOR BROILERS AND BROILER BREEDERS PUT THEM MOST AT RISK FOR THE DISEASE SINCE THEY ARE IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH LITTER AND FECAL DROPPINGS AND COCCIDIA HAVE A FECAL/ORAL LIFE CYCLE. LAYER CHICKENS HOWEVER, DO NOT BREAK WITH COCCIDIOSIS WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY AS THEY HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY REARED IN CAGES AWAY FROM THE LITTER. COCCIDIOSIS HAS BEEN CONTROLLED USING CHEMICAL ANTI-COCCIDIALS, IONOPHORES (ANTIBIOTICS), OR LIVE COCCIDIA VACCINES, BUT RECENT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS HAVE LIMITED THE ABILITY TO USE IONOPHORES SINCE THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS ANTIBIOTICS. CHANGING CONSUMER SENTIMENT HAS ALSO FORCED THE LAYER INDUSTRY TO BEGIN REARING CHICKENS ON THE FLOOR OR IN AN AVIARY SYSTEMAND OUT OF CAGES, WHERE THEY ARE NOW EXPOSED TO LITTER AND FECAL MATERIAL. THE IMPACT OF THESE REGULATIONS AND CHANGING PRODUCTION PRACTICES IS NOT KNOWN, THOUGH MANY VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS ESTIMATE THAT THE INCIDENCE OF CLINICAL COCCIDIOSIS, AND THE RELATED DISEASE NECROTIC ENTERITIS, WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE. THERE IS CURR ENTLY A NEED FOR SURVEILLANCE AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COCCIDIA SPECIES FOUND IN CLINICAL CASES SUBMITTED TO DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORIES TO EVALUATE HOW THESE CHANGES ARE AFFECTING THE PREVALENCE OF ENTERIC DISEASE.

BASED ON BROAD STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK, THE DIVISION IDENTIFIED FIVE AREAS TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS: AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING, ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD, STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES, BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES, AND NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT. THESE FIVE EMPHASIS AREAS HELP TO PROVIDE STRATEGIC LOCAL GUIDANCE FOR DIVISION RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AND HELP TO SUPPORT INTEGRATED RESEARCH/EXTENSION EFFORTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE NIFA SCIENCE EMPHASIS AREAS.  AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING A CRITICAL NEED IN ARKANSAS, AND NATIONWIDE, IS TO ENSURE FARM AND FOREST ENTERPRISES ARE PROFITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE TO MEET THE DEMANDS FOR SAFE FOOD, FIBER, AND FUEL. THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY MUST CONTEND WITH MORE REGULATIONS, HIGHER INPUT COSTS, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, CLIMATE EXTREMES, AND GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IN A HUMANE AND SUSTAINABLE MANNER WHILE DECREASING COSTS THROUGH EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. PLANT SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE ECONOMICS, ENVIRONMENT, GENETICS AND BREEDING, WEEDS, DISEASE, PEST MANAGEMENT, SAFE HANDLING AND STORAGE, FOOD PROCESSING, CULTURAL PRACTICES, AND SOIL FERTILITY.  ANIMAL SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE GENETICS, REPRODUCTION, ECONOMICS, NUTRITION, WASTE MANAGEMENT, PHYSIOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS, HEALTH, AND ANIMAL WELLBEING. COMMON TO BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL SYSTEMS IS THE APPROPRIATE USE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY.  ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOODS THE AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD IS VITAL TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN ALL COMMUNITIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE WORKS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETS THROUGH RESEARCH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS THAT TARGET OBESITY AND ENCOURAGE BETTER CONSUMER HABITS THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE EXPANDED FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM (EFNEP) AND SNAP\u2010ED. EFNEP EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, WITH LIMITED INCOME, TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ATTITUDE, AND BEHAVIOR CHANGES NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN NUTRITIONALLY SOUND DIETS AND ENHANCE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. SNAP\u2010ED PROVIDES NUTRITION EDUCATION TO FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE NUTRITION ASSISTANCE TO HELP CONSUMERS MAKE BETTER CHOICES ABOUT WHAT TO EAT TO STAY ACTIVE AND LIVE BETTER. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN FOOD SYSTEMS THROUGH RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. THE LONGTERM GROWTH OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY IN ARKANSAS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE INDUSTRY\u2019S ABILITY TO INNOVATE, TO RESPOND TO CONSUMERS\u2019 TASTE AND EXPECTATIONS, TO EMPLOY A QUALITY WORKFORCE AND TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE MAINTAINING ECONOMIC VIABILITY. PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS AND AGENCIES ARE PURSUED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS FOODS. EXTENSION PROGRAMS HELP PEOPLE FROM MANY BACKGROUNDS UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE WISE NUTRITIONAL CHOICES AND STRETCH FOOD DOLLARS BY COOKING FOR THEMSELVES AND UTILIZE A WIDER VARIETY OF FOODS. THE DIVISION ALSO STRIVES TO ENHANCE FOOD SAFETY THROUGH RESEARCH AND TEACHING BEST PRACTICES TO ALL WHO HANDLE FOOD, FROM FIELD TO TABLE. THIS INCLUDES EDUCATION RELATED TO FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, SUCH AS HOW TO ADHERE TO THE FDA\u2019S PRODUCE SAFETY RULE AND MEETING CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THROUGH SERVSAFE, A FOOD SAFETY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN FOOD HANDLING OR FOOD SERVICE AND RELATED INDUSTRIES. EXTENSION EDUCATORS PROVIDE EVIDENCE\u2010BASED INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT ARKANSANS ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE BEST FOOD SAFETY INFORMATION TO KEEP THEIR FAMILIES SAFE FROM FOODBORNE ILLNESSES AND OTHER FOOD\u2010RELATED SAFETY ISSUES. STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES  IT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES THAT AFFECT FAMILIES, CONSUMERS, AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE. THE MENTAL, PHYSICAL, AND FINANCIAL WELL\u2010BEING OF FAMILIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING PROSPERITY FOR ARKANSANS. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE IS RESPONDING TO THESE NEEDS BY DELIVERING RESEARCH\u2010BASED PROGRAMS TO REDUCE STRESS, IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH, STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS, INCREASE FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND IMPROVE WELL\u2010BEING FOR ARKANSANS. 4\u2010H CLUBS, ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS ACROSS ARKANSAS INVOLVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN HANDS\u2010ON EDUCATION AND SERVICE\u2010LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT ENHANCED THEIR LIFE SKILLS, INCLUDING DECISION MAKING, PROBLEM SOLVING, CRITICAL THINKING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES. 4\u2010H CONVEYS TO THE PUBLIC THAT ALL YOUTH HAVE VALUE. STRIVING TO REACH A DIVERSE POPULATION IS KEY TO DEVELOPING CURRICULUM, OFFERING RECOGNITION, AND TEACHING STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS TO REPRESENT OUR STATE\u2019S CURRENT DEMOGRAPHICS. BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES  CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY, TECHNOLOGY AND POPULATION ARE TRANSFORMING HOW ARKANSANS LIVE AND WORK. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND EFFECTIVELY EMPLOY TOOLS AND RESOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LABOR FORCE REQUIRES ENHANCED SKILLS AND TRAINING TO SUCCEED IN TODAY\u2019S GLOBAL ECONOMY. AT A TIME WHEN MANY RURAL AREAS ARE LOSING POPULATION, COMMUNITIES MUST TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO CREATE A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE. EFFECTIVE AND INCLUSIVE LEADERS WORKING WITH ENGAGED CITIZENS ARE KEY TO THIS EFFORT. TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL NEEDS, PROGRAMS FOCUS ON FOUR AREAS: ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EVOLVING ECONOMIES; LEADERSHIP AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT; AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE.  NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ARKANSAS FACES CRITICAL NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUES INCLUDING GROUNDWATER DECLINE IN EASTERN ARKANSAS FROM IRRIGATION, WATER QUALITY CONCERNS FROM ANIMAL MANURES, SEDIMENT LOSS FROM CROPLAND AND URBAN STORMWATER. WE ALL SHARE CONCERNS FOR SOIL HEALTH, AIR QUALITY, PROTECTION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OF FORESTS AND WILDLIFE HABITAT, BUT AGRICULTURE IS UNDER SCRUTINY TO REDUCE IMPACT ON NATURAL RESOURCES. WE FOCUS ON UNBIASED RESEARCH AND SCIENCE\u2010BASED EXTENSION EFFORTS TO BALANCE CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. PROGRAMS, SUCH AS ARKANSAS DISCOVERY FARMS AND THE CENTER FOR AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SUSTAINABILITY, WILL COLLABORATE WITH FARMERS, LANDOWNERS, AND INDUSTRY TO DELIVER INNOVATIVE, SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE PROPER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO INFORM RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS, THE DIVISION WILL LAUNCH A FORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT IN 2023 TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIES FOR THE ORGANIZATION\u2019S NEW STRATEGIC PLAN WITH INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "07ee21ac-739d-5576-dcac-ca74ea0e4047-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23AHDRXXXXG006_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735932, "Award ID": "NI23AHDRXXXXG005", "Award Amount": 7013.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-25", "CFDA Number": "10.207", "Description": "THERE IS A NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND EVALUATE THE BOVINE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VIRAL INFECTION, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF VIRAL INFECTIONS ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.

DAIRIES ONE STUDY IS RESPONDING TO RECENT GUIDELINES OF THE NATIONAL DAIRY FARM (FARMERS ASSURING RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT) PROGRAM THAT REQUIRED ALL PARTICIPATING DAIRIES TO DISBUD CALVES BEFORE 8-WEEKS OF AGE AND PROVIDE A PAIN MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DISBUDDING. A SURVEY IS BEING CONDUCTED TO 1) DESCRIBE THE CURRENT DISBUDDING AND DEHORNING PRACTICES, INCLUDING PAIN CONTROL USE ON CALIFORNIA DAIRIES; AND 2) IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT HINDER THE ADOPTION OF PAIN MANAGEMENT PLANS ON CALIFORNIA DAIRIES. ANOTHER STUDY IS WORKING TO DEVELOP MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF LAMENESS AT THE GENETIC SELECTION LEVEL. LAMENESS AND HOOF HEALTH HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED MUCH BUT IMPACTS DAIRY PRODUCERS BOTH AS AN ANIMAL WELFARE ISSUE AS WELL AS LOWERED MILK PRODUCTION. IT IS ONE OF THE TOP THREE REASONS DAIRY CATTLE ARE CULLED PREMATURELY, FOLLOWING INFERTILITY AND MASTITIS. PREMATURE CULLING REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT COST TO THE PRODUCER AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE DAIRY DUE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RAISING REPLACEMENT DAIRY HEIFERS. OTHER RESEARCH IS EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF DAIRY CALVE HOUSING (GROUP VS INDIVIDUAL) ON THE DYNAMICS OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE OF COMMENSAL FECAL E.COLI AND ENTEROCOCCUS SPECIES BACTERIA IN CALVES HOUSED IN THE CALIFORNIA-STYLE INDIVIDUAL HUTCH WITH A SIMPLE MODIFICATION TO ACCOMMODATE GROUP HOUSING. DAIRY CALVES IN CALIFORNIA ARE TYPICALLY RAISED IN INDIVIDUAL HUTCHES; YET THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST IN GROUP HOUSING OF PRE-WEANED CALVES, AND CONSUMER INTEREST IN HOUSING SYSTEMS WHICH PERMIT EXPRESSION OF NATURAL BEHAVIORS, SUCH AS SOCIAL GROOMING AND PLAY. HOWEVER, GROUP HOUSED CALVES HAVE INCREASED CALF-TO-CALF CONTACT, AND SHARE A MICROBIOME WITH THEIR PEN-MATES, INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE.
