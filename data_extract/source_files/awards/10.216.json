THESE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES WERE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER 250,000 INCREASES OF FROZEN IMPORTS THROUGH THE PHILADELPHIA PORT BETWEEN YEARS 2000 AND 2008 AND UP TO 100,000 THROUGH OTHER US PORTS. THE GROWING US MARKET DEMAND FOR MEAT GOATS ALSO MIRRORS INCREASING CONSUMER PREFERENCES FOR TASTIER, MORE NUTRITIOUS, AND HEALTHIER ORGANIC FARM PRODUCTS SUCH AS GRASS-FED MEAT/ MILK, EVEN AT HIGHER PREMIUMS. THE GROWING DEMAND FOR MEAT GOATS PRESENTS ALTERNATIVE INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR LIMITED-RESOURCE PRODUCERS, WHO CANNOT AFFORD MORE COSTLY LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS. GIVEN THAT FEEDING USUALLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF VARIABLE COSTS OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION, THE ROLE OF LOCALLY PRODUCED HIGH QUALITY, HIGH YIELDING PERENNIAL LEGUMES IN PROFITABLE SMALL RUMINANT PRODUCTION IS GAINING POPULARITY. ONE LEADING CANDIDATE IS ALFALFA (MEDICAGO SATIVA L.) WHOSE PRODUCTION IN THE SOUTHERN USA, IN RECENT YEARS, HAS EXPANDED DUE TO INCREASING COSTS OF FERTILIZERS AND TRANSPORTATION. ANOTHER MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO PROFITABLE SMALL RUMINANT PRODUCTION IN THE US IS INFECTIONS BY GASTROINTESTINAL NEMATODES (GIN), WHICH REDUCE ANIMAL PERFORMANCE (TORRES-ACOSTA AND HOSTE, 2008).

IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST DOMESTICATED CROPS AND HAS BEEN CULTIVATED FOR CENTURIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. HOWEVER, GIVEN MANY YEARS OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION OUTLAWING THE GENUS CANNABIS L, INDUSTRIAL HEMP IS CONSIDERED A NEW CROP FOR THE UNITED STATES. THE 2014 AGRICULTURAL ACT PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNIVERSITY INSTITUTIONS, LIKE 1890 INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY (TSU), TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF HEMP RESEARCH INCLUDING PRODUCTION, MARKETING, AND EXTENSION. THESE REFORMS CAUSED RESURGENCE IN HEMP PRODUCTION IN THE U.S. IN GENERAL, WITH TENNESSEE BEING AMONG THE LEADING STATES IN ADOPTING INDUSTRIAL HEMP AS A SPECIALTY CROP. MORE THAN 36 STATES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION IN SUPPORT OF HEMP AND THE NUMBER CONTINUES TO GROW. HOWEVER, THE INITIAL ENTHUSIASM FOR AND ADOPTION OF THE NEW CROP BY GROWERS IS DISSIPATING AS THE LEGISLATIVE, PRODUCTION, AND MARKET REALITIES BECOME BETTER UNDERSTOOD. THERE IS NEED TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED APPROACH ON HEMP PRODUCTION TO HELP GROWERS REALIZE THE PROFITABILITY OF THIS NEW CROP.PREVIOUS DEFINITION OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP DISTINGUISHED IT FROM MARIJUANA DEPENDING ON ITS CONCENTRATION OF THE PSYCHOACTIVE MOLECULE DELTA-9 TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC), WHICH IS PRIMARILY FORMED IN THE INFLORESCENCE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGH OBTAINED FROM USING MARIJUANA. ACCORDING TO THE 2014 FARM BILL, A DELTA-9 THC CONCENTRATION GREATER THAN 0.3% IDENTIFIED A CANNABIS PLANT AS MARIJUANA, WHILE A CONCENTRATION LESS THAN 0.3% IDENTIFIED THE PLANT AS INDUSTRIAL HEMP, EVEN THOUGH BOTH PLANTS ARE VISUALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM EACH OTHER. FEDERAL DEFINITION OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP HAS RECENTLY CHANGED TO IDENTIFY INDUSTRIAL HEMP AS HAVING A MAXIMUM OF 0.3% TOTAL THC, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH DELTA-9 THC AND ITS PRECURSOR, TETRAHYDROCANNABINOLIC ACID (THCA). MANY PRODUCERS FACED SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES COMPLYING WITH THE PREVIOUS 0.3% DELTA-9 THC LIMIT AND ARE LIKELY TO FACE EVEN GREATER HURDLES MEETING THE NEW COMPLIANCELIMIT.APART FROM COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGING REGULATIONS GOVERNING ITS PRODUCTION, INDUSTRIAL HEMP PRODUCERS FACE A HOST OF OTHER CHALLENGES INCLUDING MANAGEMENT OF DISEASES AND PESTS (INCLUDING WEEDS), CHOICE OF VARIETIES SUITED TO THEIR LOCALES, SKILLS ON HOW HEMP BEST FITS IN ROTATION WITH OTHER CROPS, INFORMATION ON HOW CULTIVARS AND TIMING OF PLANTING CAN AFFECT GROWING SUCCESS, POST-HARVEST HANDLING, AND HOW BEST TO IDENTIFY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PREVAILING MARKETS. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON TWO KEY AREAS OF INTEREST: COMPLIANCE WITH THC REGULATIONS AND THE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS TO REDUCE PROBLEMS IN DISEASE, INSECTS AND WEEDS, WHICH ARE SOME OF THE GREATEST PROBLEMS IN HEMP PRODUCTION.

THE MULCH OFTEN ENDS UP IN INCINERATION, ON-FARM BURNING AND LANDFILLS, AS THE NUMBER OF RECYCLING FACILITIES THAT ACCEPT PE MULCH IS VERY LIMITED DUE TO THE CONTAMINATION OF MULCH WITH SOIL, PESTICIDE RESIDUES AND VEGETATION.

WORLDWIDE, HEMP IS USED IN CANNABINOID AND OIL PRODUCTION. IN THE U.S. THE HEMP INDUSTRY. IS A NEW FRONTIER. CONGRESS PASSED THE AGRICULTURE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2018 (2018 FARM BILL) AND AUTHORIZED THE PRODUCTION OF HEMP AND REMOVED HEMP AND HEMP SEEDS FROM THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION&#39;S (DEA) SCHEDULE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. IN ADDITION TO ITS PRIMARY CANNABINOID AND OIL PRODUCTS, THE HEMP INDUSTRY PRODUCES A HIGH VOLUME OF EXTRACTION BIOMASS AS RESIDUE. ANNUALLY, THE INDUSTRY GENERATES ABOUT 15 MILLION TONS OF WASTE DIRECTLY FROM THE HEMP FARM BIOMASS (LEAVES, FLOWERS, STALKS) AND FROM SUBSEQUENT OIL AND CBD EXTRACTIONS. THE INDUSTRY HAS NOT YET PLACED A CLEAR DIRECTION ON HOW TO DISPOSE OF THE BIOMASS AND THERE ARE VERY FEW INITIATIVES BY THE BIOENERGY INDUSTRY TO INVESTIGATE IF HEMP BIOMASS CAN BE USED AS FEEDSTOCK FOR BIODIESEL, AND BIOETHANOL, PRODUCTION.STUDIESON THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF UNPROCESSED HEMP PLANT COMPONENTS (LEAVES, SEEDS, AND FLOWERS) AND THEIR THRESHING RESIDUES SHOW THAT HEMP HAS HIGH CONTENTS OF VARIOUS NUTRIENTS, NOTABLY CRUDE PROTEIN, AND ENERGY. AS THE ACREAGE OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP INCREASES, THE HEMP SEED CAKE, BALED HEMP, HEMP FORAGE, AND OTHER HEMP BYPRODUCTS WILL INCREASINGLY BECOME AVAILABLE TO LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS AS FEED INGREDIENTS. THE PRODUCTS ALSO HAVE GOOD POTENTIAL TO PARTIALLY REPLACE THE USE OF CEREAL GRAIN IN THE ANIMAL RATION (FAO 2019). HOWEVER, THE USE OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP BYPRODUCTS AS VALUE-ADDED ANIMAL FEEDS CANNOT BE REALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCTION AND PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF DIETARY HEMP ARE UNDERSTOOD IN TARGET RUMINANTS, SUCH AS SHEEP, CATTLE, AND GOATS. GIVEN THEUNIQUE BROWSE FEEDING HABITS AND DETOXIFYING ABILITY, GOATS COULD BE MORE BENEFITED FROM HEMP BIOMASS, IF THEY ARE SUPPLEMENTED WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNTS. THUS, THE LONG-TERM GOALS OF OUR PROJECT ARE TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR RECYCLING HEMP BIOMASS RESIDUES AS VALUE-ADDED AND SAFE FEED IN GOAT DIETS IN WAYS THAT ADD A NOVEL NUTRIENT RESOURCE TO THE ANIMAL FEED INGREDIENT POOL. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT INCLUDE EVALUATING THE NUTRITIONAL VALUES OF HEMP RESIDUE AND UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF FEEDING HEMP EXTRACTION RESIDUE ON THE GROWTH, FEED INTAKE, AND EFFICIENCY OF MILK YIELD AND MEAT-PRODUCING GOATS. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY ANALYZING THE NUTRIENT PROFILE OF VARIOUS HEMP PLANT COMPONENTS AND EXTRACTION RESIDUES FROM HEMP PROCESSING FACILITIES AND DETERMINING THE EFFECTS OF THE UTILIZATION OF HEMP EXTRACTION RESIDUES AS GOAT FEED IN THE PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE OF GOATS AND THEIR PRODUCT QUALITY. TWO HEMP PROCESSING METHODS, NAMELY CANNABINOID EXTRACTION AND OIL EXTRACTION WILL BE EVALUATED FOR THEIR EFFECTS ON THE NUTRIENT CONTENTS OF HEMP EXTRACTION RESIDUES. IN ADDITION, THREE PLANT COMPONENTS, NAMELY SEEDS, FLOWERS, AND LEAVES FROM FIVE HEMP VARIETIES.

THE U.S. NATIONAL OIL PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION HAS SET A MINIMUM THRESHOLD OF 44% (12% DM) PROTEIN CONCENTRATION IN NON-DEHULLED SOYBEAN MEAL FOR HIGH QUALITY ANIMAL FEED TO SUPPORT PROPER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF POULTRY AND LIVESTOCK. IDEALLY, SOYBEAN SEED WITH AVERAGE OIL CONCENTRATION OF 18% SHOULD CONTAIN 35% PROTEIN TO PRODUCE MEAL WITH 44% PROTEIN CONCENTRATION. SOYBEAN YIELD IN UNITED STATES IS GRADUALLY INCREASING AS A RESULT OF HIGH YIELDING MODERN CULTIVARS ALONG WITH IMPROVED CROPPING SYSTEM, CROP CULTIVATION AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. CURRENTLY UNITED STATES AVERAGE SOYBEAN YIELD IS 3445 KG HA-1 AFTER GRADUALLY INCREASED FROM 2241 KG HA-1 IN 1986. HOWEVER, IN THE MEANTIME SEED PROTEIN CONCENTRATION HAS STEADILY DECREASED FROM 35.5% IN 1986 TO 33.5% IN 2021 AT THE RATE OF 36.5 KG HA-1YR-1. AS A RESULT, CURRENTLY PRODUCED SOYBEAN MEAL IN THE U.S. OFTEN STRUGGLE TO MEET HIGH QUALITY ANIMAL FEED STANDARD WHICH HAS GENERATED MAJOR ECONOMIC AND MARKETING CONCERNS. HENCE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO IMPROVE SOYBEAN SEED PROTEIN CONCENTRATIONTO MAKE U.S. SOYBEAN COMPETITIVE IN GLOBAL FEED MARKET.SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN FIXATION (PROCESS WHERE PLANTS HARBOR NITROGEN FIXING BACTERIA IN THEIR ROOTS AND CAPTURES AND UTILIZE FREELY AVAILABLE ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN FOR THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT) PROVIDES MAJORITY OF NITROGEN NEED IN SOYBEAN. HENCE FARMERS USUALLY APPLY NO OR LITTLE ADDITIONAL NITROGEN FERTILIZER IN SOYBEAN FIELD. HOWEVER MODERN HIGH YIELDING SOYBEAN CULTIVARS REQUIRES VERY HIGH DOSE OF N DURING ITS SEED FILLING STAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, CROP NEED 190 KG N/HA TO PRODUCE SOYBEAN YIELD OF 3400 KG/HA WITH 35% PROTEIN CONCENTRATION. HENCE ONLY SYMBIOTIC BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN FIXATION MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THE HIGH N DEMAND IN MODERN HIGH YIELDING SOYBEAN CULTIVARS. THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE FROM SOME RECENT STUDIES THAT LOW SEED PROTEIN CONCENTRATION IN MODERN SOYBEAN CULTIVARS IS DUE TO THE INABILITY OF SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN FIXATION TO KEEP UP WITH THE HIGH RATES OF N DEMAND DURING SEED FILLING PHASE. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED EARLY SEASON N FERTILIZATION COULD SUPPRESSBIOLOGICAL N FIXATION WHILE LATE-SEASON N APPLICATION CAN IMPROVE SOYBEAN YIELD AND SEED PROTEIN CONCENTRATION WITHOUT NEGATIVELY AFFECTING BIOLOGICAL N FIXATION. THE ASSIMILATE DEMAND IN SOYBEAN IS MUCH HIGHER DURING SEED GROWTH. HENCE BEGINNING OF THE SEED FILLING PHASE COULD BE THE IDEAL STAGE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL N APPLICATION IN SOYBEAN. HOWEVER, THERE IS COMPARATIVELY LESS INFORMATION REGARDING THE EFFECT OF N APPLICATIONS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF SEED FILLING STAGE IN SOYBEAN. HENCE, THE PROJECT AIMS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT LEVEL AND TIMING OF LATE SEASON N FERTILIZER APPLICATION ON SOYBEAN YIELD AND SEED COMPOSITION.BIOCHAR IS A CARBON RICH PRODUCT OF BIOMASS DECOMPOSITION UNDER LIMITED OXYGEN ENVIRONMENT. BIOCHAR DUE TO ITS HIGH STABILITY, CARBON CONTENT, SURFACE AREA, CAT,ION EXCHANGE CAPACITY AND POROSITY HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED AS A SOIL AMENDMENT IN SEVERAL CROPS TO IMPROVE SOIL PH, WATER AND NUTRIENT HOLDING CAPACITY, CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND OVERALL SOIL FERTILITY. BIOCHAR APPLICATION IN SOYBEAN WAS ALSO FOUND EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING ROOT GROWTH, MICROBIAL BIOMASS AND ROOT NODULATION, WHICH ARE THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR FOR BIOLOGICAL N FIXATION. THE RESULTS FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES SUGGEST THAT BIOCHAR APPLICATION COULD IMPROVE SOYBEAN N FIXING EFFICIENCY AND POTENTIALLY SUBSTITUTE SOME N FERTILIZATION NEEDS TO MEET HIGH N DEMAND DURING SEED FILLING. HENCE THE PROJECT AIMS TO CONDUCT TWO YEARS OF FIELD EXPERIMENT TESTING THE EFFECT OF BIOCHAR APPLICATION BEFORE PLANTING AND LATE SEASON N FERTILIZATION ON SOYBEAN&#39;S BIOLOGICAL N FIXATION, YIELD AND SEED QUALITY WITH THE MAIN GOAL OF IDENTIFYING OPTIMAL N MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN SOYBEAN TO IMPROVE ITS SEED QUALITY.LACK OF HIGH-QUALITY PHENOTYPIC DATA WITH ADEQUATE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION REMAINS ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN AGRICULTURE RESEARCH. MANUAL DATA COLLECTION IS VERY SLOW, LABOR-INTENSIVE, EXPENSIVE, SUBJECTIVE AND PRONE TO HUMAN ERROR. HENCE, THERE IS A NEED TO FIND OUT MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE PHENOTYPING TOOLS. RECENTLY, HIGH THROUGHPUT AERIAL PHENOTYPING (HTAP) HAS EMERGED AS A FAST AND RELIABLE PHENOTYPING METHOD TO MONITOR CROP GROWTH, NUTRIENT, WATER AND OTHER INPUT STATUS AND BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESS DETECTION. HTAP ALLOWS PHENOTYPING AT HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION COMPARED TO THE MANUAL OR DESTRUCTIVE PHENOTYPING THAT ARE OFTEN LIMITED ONE TO FEW MEASUREMENTS. HENCE, IT IS RAPIDLY EMERGING AS A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE TO MANUAL OR DESTRUCTIVE PHENOTYPING IN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH. STUDIES HAVE REPEATEDLY SHOWED ITS USEFULNESS IN ASSESSING CROP GROWTH, SEVERAL MORPHOPHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS, YIELD, INPUT LIMITATIONS, AND BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESS DETECTION IN MULTIPLE CROPS INCLUDING SOYBEAN. DIFFERENT CAMERAS AND SENSORS ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH OTHERS, WERE FOUND EFFECTIVE IN MONITORING CROP GROWTH, PHYSIOLOGY, BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESS DETECTION, MATURITY, AND YIELD ESTIMATION IN SOYBEAN. DUE TO WIDE VARIATION IN THE SENSORS USED, AERIAL IMAGERY DATA EXTRACTION PROCESS, AND RESULTS ACROSS THE STUDIES, THERE IS NOT YET CLEAR INFORMATION REGARDING WHICH AERIAL PHENOTYPING SENSORS AND INDICES ARE BEST SUITED FOR MEASURING EACH TRAIT. ONE OF THE REASONS BEHIND THAT IS THE LACK OF STUDIES THAT USED AND COMPARED SEVERAL CAMERAS IN THE SAME EXPERIMENT, AS MOST OF THEM ARE LIMITED TO ONE OR FEW CAMERAS. HENCE, IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL USE SEVERAL SENSORS THAT WERE WIDELY USED AND HAVE ALREADY PROVEN THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN PREVIOUS AERIAL PHENOTYPING STUDIES IN SOYBEAN. WE WILL COLLECT AERIAL IMAGES USING AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) FITTED WITH RGB, MULTISPECTRAL, THERMAL, LIDAR AND HYPERSPECTRAL SENSORS, AT THE SAME TIME EVERY TWO WEEKS DURING CROP GROWING SEASON. WE WILL ALSO RECORD SEVERAL MORPHOPHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS ON OR AROUND THE DAYO,F AERIAL PHENOTYPING, SUCH AS PLANT HEIGHT, BIOMASS, LEAF AREA INDEX, LEAF CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT, PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY, AND FINAL SOYBEAN YIELD. THE GOAL IS TO FIND OUT AND RECOMMEND THE MOST EFFECTIVE TIME, SENSOR, BANDS AND AERIAL INDICES TO MEASURE EACH OF THOSE TRAITS.HTAP HAS CREATED A LOT OF INTEREST IN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF ITS NUMEROUS APPLICATIONS. SEVERAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL ARE INTERESTED TO LEARN AND USE THIS TECHNOLOGY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO LABOR AND TIME INTENSIVE MANUAL DATA COLLECTION IN THEIR RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAM. HTAP HAS ALSO SHOWED ITS EFFECTIVENESS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF NUTRIENT, WATER AND OTHER INPUTS LIMITATIONS, INSECT, DISEASE AND WEED INFESTATION IN THE FIELD. HENCE, FARMERS CAN UTILIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR FIELD TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AT AN EARLIER STAGE WITH RELATIVELY LESS EFFORTS COMPARED TO IDENTIFICATION AT LATER STAGES WITH MANUAL SCOUTING, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MORE LABORAND RESOURCES ACCOMPANIED BY GREATER YIELD LOSS. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF ADVANCEMENT IN DRONE, CAMERA AND AERIAL IMAGE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE. AS A RESULT, THEY ARE BECOMING MORE AFFORDABLE AND USER FRIENDLY. FARMERS ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO SHOW THEIR INTEREST TO LEARN AND ADOPT THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR CROP MONITORING IN THEIR FARM. HENCE, THE PROJECT ALSO AIMS TO DISSEMINATE HIGH THROUGHPUT AERIAL PHENOTYPING TECHNOLOGY TO AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL AND FARMERS VIA ON-SITE DEMONSTRATIONS, TRAININGS AND SEMINARS.

HOWEVER, THE UNITED STATES HAS SHOWN A DECREASE IN AQUACULTURE OF FINFISH AND INCREASES IN CATCH-FISHERIES ACTIVITIES AND IMPORTS. THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO ECONOMIC RESTRICTIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. HENCE, UNITED STATES FISH FARMERS NEED ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTION STRATEGIES THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AND HAVE REDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL PRACTICE OF FISH MONOCULTURE. IN SMALL INSTITUTIONS LIKE LINCOLN UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI, LIMITATIONS SUCH AS BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, HEAVY TEACHING LOAD OF FACULTY, LACK OF SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERTS/FACULTY, AND LACK OF ACCESS TO STATE-OF-THE-ART EQUIPMENT RESTRICT THE OPPORTUNITIES OF STUDENTS IN INNOVATIONAL AREAS.

IS ONE OF THE TOP-SELLING DECIDUOUS FLOWERING SHRUBS AND ARE DOMINANT LANDSCAPE PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES (CHAPPELL ET AL. 2012). CRAPEMYRTLES ARE USED IN LANDSCAPING AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT BY PUBLIC PLANNERS, PRIVATE BUSINESSES, AND HOMEOWNERS ALIKE. ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE CENSUS OF HORTICULTURAL SPECIALTIES FOUND THAT ANNUAL CRAPEMYRTLE SALES WERE $69 MILLION IN 2019. THIS MAKES CRAPEMYRTLE A LUCRATIVE CROP WITH HIGH AESTHETIC VALUE THROUGHOUT THE REGION. MANY FACTORS INFLUENCE THE PROFITABILITY OF THE CRAPEMYRTLE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING CONSUMER DEMAND FOR COLOR, THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION, AND PEST MANAGEMENT EXPENDITURES.CRAPEMYRTLES ARE THREATENED BY SEVERAL KEY INSECT PESTS. CRAPEMYRTLE APHID [CMA, TINOCALLIS KAHAWALUOKALANI KIRKALDY (HEMIPTERA: APHIDIDAE)] IS ONE OF THE ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT PESTS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE APPEARANCE AND GROWTH PERFORMANCE OF CRAPEMYRTLE (HERBERT AND MIZELL III 2006, FRANK 2019). FOLIAR FEEDING BY APHIDS STUNTS GROWTH AND DISTORTS LEAVES. THE APHIDS ALSO REDUCE THEAESTHETIC QUALITY OF PLANTS BY SECRETING HONEYDEW, WHICH RESULTS IN OUTBREAKS OF SOOTY MOLD ON FOLIAGE. FOLIAR FEEDING BEETLES, INCLUDING JAPANESE BEETLE (POPILLIA JAPONICA NEWMAN) AND FLEA BEETLES (ALTICA SPP.), CAN REDUCE GROWTH AND AESTHETIC VALUE OF PLANTS IN PRODUCTION AND LANDSCAPE. IN 2004, A NEW INSECT PEST OF CRAPEMYRTLE WAS FOUND INFESTING PLANTINGS IN RICHARDSON, TEXAS. LIKE THE CRAPEMYRTLE APHID, CRAPEMYRTLE BARK SCALE [CMBS; ACANTHOCOCCUS LAGERSTROEMIAE KUWANA], FEEDS ON THE PLANT VASCULAR TISSUE, BUT DOES SO THROUGH THE BARK INSTEAD OF THE FOLIAGE (CHAPPELL ET AL. 2012, FRANK 2019). HEAVY INFESTATIONS RESULT IN LEAF ABSCISSION AND BRANCH DIEBACK. CMBS ALSO PRODUCES COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF HONEYDEW, WHICH RESULTS IN UNSIGHTLY SOOTY MOLD ON THE FOLIAGE AND AREAS SURROUNDING THE PLANT.CRAPEMYRTLES CAN ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DISEASES. POWDERY MILDEW (PM), CAUSED BY THE FUNGUS ERYSIPHE LAGERSTROEMIAE, IS THE MOST WIDESPREAD AND DAMAGING DISEASE OBSERVED IN CRAPEMYRTLE. IT OCCURS MOST OFTEN ON YOUNG, ACTIVELY GROWING PLANT TISSUES, REDUCING GROWTH. ANOTHER COMMON DISEASE OF CRAPEMYRTLE IS CERCOSPORA LEAF SPOT (CLS), CAUSED BY THE FUNGUS PSEUDOCERCOSPORA LYTHRACEARUM HEALD AND WOLF. RESISTANCE TO BOTH PATHOGENS HAS BEEN EVALUATED IN MANY OF THE OLDER CRAPEMYRTLE CULTIVARS, WITH THE IDENTIFICATION OF PM RESISTANCE BEING HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT TO PLANT BREEDING PROGRAMS.CURRENTLY, IN TENNESSEE, THE MOST IMPORTANT INSECT PEST OF CRAPEMYRTLE IS THE APHID.

FAURIEI) AND MATURE PLANT HEIGHT (DWARF, MEDIUM, OR TALL) CAN PREDICT CMA RESISTANCE (ALVERSON AND ALLEN 1992, MIZELL AND KNOX 1993, PETTIS ET AL. 2004). GREATER CMA POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ON L. INDICA &TI,MES; L. FAUREI CULTIVARS THAN ON CULTIVARS OF THE SPECIES L. INDICA (HERBERT ET AL. 2009, MIZELL III &AMP; KNOX 1993), INDICATING THAT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CMA MAY BE PLEIOTROPIC (RIBEIRO ET AL. 2021). DWARF PLANTS WERE MORE RESISTANT TO CMA THAN MEDIUM OR TALL PLANTS (HERBERT ET AL. 2009, MIZELL III &AMP; KNOX 1993). CRAPEMYRTLE BARK SCALE ARRIVED IN TENNESSEE IN 2013 IN MEMPHIS AND HAS BEEN SLOWLY MOVING EAST INTO MAJOR CITIES. IT IS NOT YET PRESENT IN THE NURSERY PRODUCTION REGION OF MIDDLE TENNESSEE. TO DATE, RESISTANCE TO CMBS HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED IN ANY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CULTIVAR OF CRAPEMYRTLE IN THE USA. ONLY THE TROPIC SPECIES L. SPECIOSA HAS SHOWN ANY RESISTANCE TO CMBS IN TRIALS (WU ET AL. 2021).THE MAIN PATHOGEN OF CONCERN TO CRAPEMYRTLE IN TENNESSEE IS POWDERY MILDEW. INCORPORATING POWDERY MILDEW RESISTANCE INTO CRAPEMYRTLE HAS BEEN A FOCUS OF BREEDERS FOR DECADES. CULTIVARS WITH PURE L. INDICA GENETICS TEND TO BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO POWDERY MILDEW. THE US NATIONAL ARBORETUM PIONEERED THE RELEASE OF L. INDICA &TIMES; L. FAURIEI HYBRIDS WITH POWDERY MILDEW RESISTANCE. MOST POPULAR CULTIVARS CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET HAVE SOME LEVEL OF POWDERY MILDEW RESISTANCE (CHAPPELL ET AL. 2012). HOWEVER,AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW MAY COME AT THE COST OF APHID SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND VICE VERSA.ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE, THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL WILL FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOW RESISTANCE TO CMA AND POWDERY MILDEW IS EXPRESSED UNDER TWO DIFFERENT GROWING CONDITIONS: GREENHOUSE (CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT) AND FIELD CONTAINER PRODUCTION (OPEN-AIR). WE WILL ALSO CONSIDER HOW MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MAY CHANGE BASED ON PRODUCTION STAGE (PROPAGATION OR FINISHING) AND MANAGEMENT OPTIONS (CONVENTIONAL CHEMICALS OR BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS). WHILE HOST PLANT RESISTANCE CAN BE A GREAT TOOL FOR PEST MANAGEMENT, THERE MAY BE NEGATIVE EFFECTS AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE, PLANTS WITH SOME LEVEL OF RESISTANCE TO APHIDS DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF TOXIC COMPOUNDS MAYINADVERTENTLY RESULT IN NEGATIVE FITNESS COSTS ON NATURAL ENEMIES THAT CONSUME THEM.

GLOBALLY, THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY IS DEMANDING PROFESSIONALLY QUALIFIED GRADUATES FOR THE RESURGENCE OF ALL ITS SECTORS. THE DIFFERENT HOSPITALITY SECTORS INCLUDE FOOD AND BEVERAGE (RESTAURANTS), TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION, TOURISM, MEETING AND EVENT PLANNING, SPAS, ATTRACTIONS, GAMING, ENTERTAINMENT, AND RECREATION. INDUSTRY LEADERS ARE LOOKING FOR GRADUATES WITH DEGREES IN HOSPITALITY TO BE PREPARED FOR THE WORKPLACE BY BEING EDUCATED AND WELL TRAINED IN CURRENT INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGY (SCHOFFSTALL, 2013). THE NEW HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT PINE BLUFF (UAPB) IS PROPOSING TO PREPARE ITS GRADUATES FOR THE FACE-PACED, DYNAMIC SECTORS OF THE INDUSTRY. THIS PROPOSED PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE SECTOR&#39;S NEEDS BY PROVIDING GRADUATES WITH EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING VITAL FOR SUCCESS IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY USING TECHNOLOGY BY ESTABLISHING A HOSPITALITY TECHNOLOGY CLASSROOM/LABORATORY. THIS CLASSROOM LABORATORY WILL CONSIST OF THE LATEST COMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN THROUGH ASSIMILATION OF VARIOUS HOSPITALITY FUNCTIONS SUCH AS RESTAURANT OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT, GUEST SERVICES CHECK-IN AND OUT, MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING, CATERING CONTRACTS, AND SALES MARKETING. THE STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN PRACTICAL SKILLS AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND LEARN THE SOFT SKILLS THE INDUSTRY HAS STATED THEY DESPERATELY NEED.UAPB COMPLETED RESEARCH AND REALIZED THE INDUSTRY NEEDS FROM A GLOBAL POINT OF VIEW TO ITS LOCAL GROWTH IN HOSPITALITY OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CITY OF PINE BLUFF, REGIONALLY, AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS A RESULT OF THE RESEARCH, UAPB ESTABLISHED A NEW BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE PROGRAM IN HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT (HTM) IN THE FALL OF 2020. THE PROGRAM&#39;S ESTABLISHMENT IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE LOCAL NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. SARACEN CASINO RESORT OPENED IN PINE BLUFF IN OCTOBER 2020. THE FACILITY LOCATED JUST 5 MILES FROM UAPB HASCOMPLETED PHASE I, INCLUDING A FINE DINING RESTAURANT, SPORTS BAR, CASUAL RESTAURANT, CRAFT BEER BREWERY AND BAR, A FULL-SERVICE BUFFET, AND A FOOD COURT THAT INCLUDES THE OPERATION OF A LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCT. THE SECOND PHASE OF THE RESORT WILL CONSIST OF A HOTEL AND SPA. WITH SUCH A MASSIVE HOSPITALITY OPERATION CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY, STUDENTS AND GRADUATES FROM THE NEW HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM PROGRAM HAVE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM THE CLASSROOM TO A PROFESSIONAL WORKPLACE LOCALLY. ALSO, THIS PROGRAM COULD QUICKLY EXPAND THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHEAST REGION OF THE STATE DUE TO MANY OUTDOOR TOURISM SITES. OTHER STATE AREAS SEEKING WELL-PREPARED HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT GRADUATES INCLUDE THE RECENTLY EXPANDED AND UPGRADED OAKLAWN RACING AND CASINO IN HOT SPRINGS, ARKANSAS. OAKLAWN RECENTLY BUILT A NEW BOUTIQUE HOTEL, SPA, AND EVENT CENTER COMPLETED EARLY IN 2021. ALSO, LITTLE ROCK, THE STATE&#39;S CAPITAL, HAS MANY HOTELS, AND A MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM AND IS SWIFTLY BECOMING A \"FOODIE\" LOCATION WITH ITS NEW RESTAURANTS AND BREWERIES ALONG THE REMODELED AND UPGRADED RIVERFRONT. GREAT HOTELS, RESTAURANTS, AND CASINOS WITH GAMING IN WEST MEMPHIS, ARKANSAS, AND GREENVILLE, MISSISSIPPI. THIS PROJECT ALSO SEEKS TO PREPARE STUDENTS NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY BY OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CLASSROOM/LABORATORY TO LEARN, EXPLORE, DESIGN, AND SERVE WORLD CUISINES.PROJECT JUSTIFICATION.PROJECT VALUE. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE VALUE OF HAVING A CURRENT AND RELEVANT CURRICULUM VALUED BY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS, STAKEHOLDERS, AND ACCREDITATION AGENCIES. UPGRADING THE CURRICULUM IS VITAL IN BRIDGING THE GAP FOR UAPB STUDENTS TO BE COMPETITIVE LOCALLY, REGIONALLY, NATIONALLY, AND INTERNATIONALLY. STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE BELIEVING THE EDUCATION HAS PREPARED THEM FOR THE WORKPLACE (KAUFMANN, &AMP; FELDMAN, 2004). FURTHER, THE ROLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS TO PROVIDE GRADUATE EMPLOYABILITY (SATO ET AL., 2021). HOWEVER, HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS REPORT A GAP BETWEEN WHAT STUDENTS HAVE LEARNED AND THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE SWIFTLY INTO MANAGEMENT POSITIONS. REVISING THE CURRENT CURRICULUM WILL ADD VALUE TO THE PROGRAM, INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY. ADDITIONAL VALUE OF THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THE COMPETITIVENESS REQUIRING AN ELEVATED LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY. THE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM INDUSTRY IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING A TECHNOLOGICALLY DRIVEN INDUSTRY REQUIRING COLLEGE GRADUATES TO BE WELL TRAINED, EDUCATED, AND READY TO ENTER THE WORKPLACE (HODGES &AMP; LINK, 2019). THE HTM PROGRAM LABORATORY CLASSROOMS NEED COMPUTERS, POINT OF SALE PROGRAMS, RESTAURANT AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE, AND CATERING MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE TO IMPROVE TECHNICAL SKILLS.ACCORDING TO BATRA (2016), THE INDUSTRY SEEKS ALL WAYS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN GRADUATES AND QUALIFIED HOSPITALITY WORKERS ACROSS THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. FURTHER, BILSLAND ET AL. (2020) REPORT THAT POST-COVID -19 ADJUSTMENTS NEED TO ADDRESS INDUSTRY TRAINING MECHANISMS AND WORK-RELATED LEARNING. THUS, GIVEN SOME RECENT PHYSICAL RESTRICTIONS, TECHNOLOGY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO HELP TRAIN STUDENTS BEFORE PHYSICALLY MOVING INTO THE WORKPLACE. IN SUMMARY, GRADUATES NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK REMOTELY AS WELL AS PHYSICALLY IN THE INDUSTRY. THIS PROJECT WILL UTILIZE THE GRANT FUNDS TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE LABORATORY/CLASSROOM TO INSTRUCT STUDENTS USING THE TECHNOLOGY SOFTWARE IN MULTIPLE CLASSES AND TWO-DEGREE PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION THROUGH TEACHING AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING. THE PI HAS ASCERTAINED THE MOST RECENT AND HIGHLY REGARDED TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS FOR HOSPITALITY USED BY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING COMPLEX AND SOFTWARE PACKAGES, WILL BE PURCHASED AND INSTALLED IN A HOSPITALITY LABORATORY/CLASSROOM ALLOWING STUDENTS TO OPERATE DIVERSE FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS SUCH AS A COFFEE SHOP/DELI OR DINNER CAF&EACUTE;. AFTER INSTALLATION, FACULTY WILL BE TRAINED IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. IN TURN, FACULTY WILL THEN USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO INSTRUCT STUDENTS IN THEIR CLASSES.ONGOING AND RECENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE PROJECT. UAPB RESPONDED TO THE NEEDS OF THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY BY CREATING A HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM DEGREE PROGRAM IN 2020. THIS DEGREE PROGRAM IS ALIGNED WITH THE INDUSTRY BOTH LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY.

THE PROPOSED STUDY IS AIMED AT DEMONSTRATING THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A NOVEL APPROACH FOR THE TREATMENT OF S. AUREUS MASTITIS IN DAIRY ANIMALS.

THE FAB LAB WILL SUPPORT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN APPAREL, MERCHANDISING AND TEXTILES (AMTX) AT SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY AND A&AMP;M COLLEGE (SUBR) WISHING TO START OR IMPROVE ON AN EXISTING FASHION, APPAREL AND/OR TEXTILES RELATED SMALL BUSINESS. THE FAB LAB WILL ALSO TARGET MINORITY HIGH SCHOOL AGED YOUTH IN BATON ROUGE AND SURROUNDING RURAL AREAS. THIS UNDERSERVED POPULATION WILL LEARN ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS THROUGH A SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM SPONSORED THROUGH THE FAB LAB.ALTHOUGH CURRENT TRENDS INDICATE THAT THERE IS A RISE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AMONG PEOPLE OF COLOR, MINORITIES STILL MAKE UP JUST 14.6% OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE U.S. (HECHT, 2014). MANY FACTORS UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEARTH OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY AMONG WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR; ONE SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IS ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF-EFFICACY (ESE). ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF-EFFICACY REFERS TO AN INDIVIDUAL&#39;S LEVEL OF SELF-CONFIDENCE OR THEIR BELIEF THAT THEY HAVE THE NECESSARY SKILLS AND ABILITIES TO SUCCEED IN CREATING A BUSINESS (BOYD &AMP; VOZIKIS, 1994). EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION INITIATIVES HAVE A POSITIVE CORRELATION ON ESE AMONG MINORITIES THEREBY RESULTING IN A STRENGTHENED PIPELINE OF POTENTIAL ENTREPRENEURS AMONG THESE GROUPS (BRYANT, FABIAN, KINNAMON, &AMP; WRIGHT, 2012). FURTHER, THE ENHANCEMENT OF ESE IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS ALSO INCREASES THEIR DRIVE TO BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR OR DISPLAY ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILL SETS (STUDDARD, DAWSON &AMP; JACKSON, 2011).RESIDENTS OF RURAL AREAS REPRESENT ANOTHER SEGMENT OF SOCIETY WHERE PARTICIPATION IN ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY IS LOW. RURAL AREAS PRESENT UNIQUE CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSITY FOR RURAL ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, INCLUDING LOWER LEVELS OF POPULATION DENSITY, CONSUMER INCOME, AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT (USDA, 2002). LOW POPULATION DENSITY HINDERS BUSINESS GROWTH, AND AS A RESULT, RURAL BUSINESSES TEND TO BE SMALL WITH A VAST MAJORITY OF OWNERS OPERATING BUSINESSES IN THEIR AREA RESIDENCE (KUGLER, MICHAELIDES, NANDA &AMP; AGBAYANI, 2017). RURAL COMMUNITIES LAG BEHIND CITIES IN INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND BANDWIDTH CAPACITY DUE TO REMOTENESS AND LOW POPULATION DENSITY WHICH OFTEN RESULTS IN REDUCED COMPUTER ACCESS AND USE (SHIELDS, 2005).

THE INCIDENCE OF GUT RELATED DISORDERS IS ON THE RISE, AND DUE TO COMPLEX NATURE OF THE DISEASE AND ORGAN, NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE MALADY. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT DYSBIOSIS AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN THE GUT CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROGRESSION OF INTESTINAL INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE (IBD) AND LEAKY GUT SYNDROME. IN ELDERLY, LEAKY GUT LEADS TO ACTIVATION OF IMMUNE MECHANISMS LINKED INFLAMMATION AND AUTOIMMUNITY LEADING TO SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS AND NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES. RESEARCH HAS ESTABLISHED THAT ENTERIC BACTERIA PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN MAINTAINING HOMEOSTASIS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 1000 TRILLION BACTERIA AND &GT;1000 MICROORGANISMS RESIDE IN THE GI TRACT OF HUMAN. THESE ORGANISMS HAVE DEVELOPED A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HOST BODY AND HELP NOT ONLY EXCHANGE MATERIAL AND INFORMATION BUT CONTRIBUTE TO THE HOST&#39;S NUTRITION, METABOLISM, EXCRETION, IMMUNITY, ETC. INTESTINAL BACTERIA HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INFLUENCE CENTRAL PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS SUCH AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LYMPHATIC TISSUE, THE INDUCTION OF MUCOSAL TOLERANCE, ANGIOGENESIS, FAT STORAGE AND NEURO-ENDOCRINE FUNCTIONS. IN THIS RESPECT, PROBIOTICS ARE GAINING WIDESPREAD RECOGNITION AS NEW PREVENTION STRATEGIES OR THERAPIES FOR SEVERAL CHRONIC DISEASES. FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) DEFINED PROBIOTICS AS: \"LIVE MICROORGANISMS\", WHICH, WHEN ADMINISTERED IN ADEQUATE AMOUNT CONFERS A HEALTH BENEFIT ON THE HOST. THE INTESTINE REMAINS THE GATEWAY TO MOST OF THE HEALTH EFFECTS DUE TO PREBIOTICS, WHICH MEDIATES THE MODULATION OF PROBIOTIC MICROORGANISMS.CURRENT PREBIOTICS ARE PREDOMINANTLY CARBOHYDRATE-BASED, BUT OTHER SUBSTANCES SUCH AS POLYPHENOLS AND POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS ALSO EXERT PREBIOTIC EFFECTS AND SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE BIFIDOBACTERIA, LACTOBACILLI AND BUTYRATE PRODUCTION. GENERALLY REGARDED AS SAFE (GRAS) LACTOBACILLUS (INTESTINE) AND BIFIDOBACTERIUM (COLON) ARE THE TWO PROMINENT GROUPS WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED IN FOODS AND OCCUPY IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL POSITIONS IN THE HUMAN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. A PROBIOTIC MAY BE A SINGLE BACTERIAL STRAIN OR CONSORTIUM OF YEAST OR MOLD AS FOUND IN YOGHURT, FERMENTED AND UNFERMENTED FOODS AND BEVERAGES. SEVERAL SECONDARY METABOLITES PRESENT IN PLANTS LIKE RESVERATROL, QUERCETIN, POLYSACCHARIDES, COCOA HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PREBIOTICS. PREBIOTICS HELP MAINTAIN OPTIMAL BALANCE OF PROBIOTIC ORGANISMS. ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF AGEING AND PHYSIOLOGICAL DECLINE IS THE LOSS OF GUT INTEGRITY LEADING TO &#39;LEAKY GUT&#39;. THIS CAUSES LEACHING OF GUT MICROBIOME, PATHOGENS AND EXTERNAL MOLECULES INTO BLOOD STREAM LEADING TO INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES, HYPER-IMMUNE ACTIVATION, ETC. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO PRESCRIPTIONS FOR TREATING THIS CONDITION.DIET AND NUTRITION PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN DETERMINING THE WELLBEING, DELAY AGE RELATED DEGENERATION, IMPROVE REGENERATION AND REDUCE THE RISK OF GUT DISEASES. THE LEAKY GUT STARTS INFLAMMATION AND AUTOIMMUNITY LEADING TO SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS AND NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES. APPLICATION OF PHYTOCHEMICALS TO MODULATE GUT MICROBIOME AND IMPROVE GUT INTEGRITY MAY BE A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO REMEDY THIS DISORDER. SEVERAL PHYTOCHEMICALS ALONG WITH GUT MICROBIOME AND ITS METABOLITES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MAINTAINING GUT INTEGRITY/HEALTH IN MODEL ORGANISMS AND HUMANS. SYNBIOTICS ARE SUBSTANCES WHICH PROVIDE GUT MICROBIOME ENHANCING MOLECULES AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTRIBUTE BENEFICIAL ORGANISMS TO THE GUT MICROBIAL CONSORTIA. PLANT METABOLITES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PROMOTE WELLNESS AND REDUCE DAMAGE, OR ENHANCE THE ORGANISM&#39;S CAPACITY TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE, LEADING TO REDUCED RISK OF DISEASES AND EXTENDED LONGEVITY. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY METABOLITES OF PLANTS ARE KNOWN TO ENHANCE ORGANISM&#39;S CAPACITY TO REDUCE/REPAIR THE DAMAGE LEADING TO REDUCED RISK OF AGE-RELATED DISEASES AND EXTENDED LONGEVITY. AMONG THE METABOLITES, RESVERATROL, A STILBENOID IS RECOGNIZED TO HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON METABOLIC SYNDROME-RELATED ALTERATIONS, INCLUDING GLUCOSE AND LIPID HOMEOSTASIS IMPROVEMENT AND A REDUCTION IN FAT MASS, BLOOD PRESSURE, LOW-GRADE INFLAMMATION, AND OXIDATIVE STRESS AS WELL AS ENHANCE THE GROWTH OFLACTOCOCCUS LACTISAND INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS. PLANT DERIVED STILBENOID RESVERATROL AND CURCUMIN ARE SUCCESSFULLY BEING USED TO TREAT VARIOUS AILMENTS. RESVERATROL MODULATES GUT MICROBIOTA, AND ITS BIOTRANSFORMATION BY GUT MICROBIOTA HELP MAINTAIN GUT HOMEOSTASIS. RESVERATROL IS PARTIALLY METABOLIZED BY GUT MICROBIOTA INDUCING CHANGES IN BACTERIAL COMPOSITION ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFICIAL METABOLIC OUTCOME. BERRY PHYTOCHEMICALS HAVE ALSO SHOWN TO EXHIBIT NUMEROUS HEALTH BENEFITS INCLUDING ANTICANCER, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANTI-HYPERTENSION, AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES.MUSCADINE GRAPE (VITIS ROTUNDIFOLIA) IS A RICH SOURCE OF FLAVONOIDS, STILBENES AND PROANTHOCYANIDINS WITH ANTIOXIDANT, ANTI-MICROBIAL, ANTI-CANCER, ANTI-DIABETIC, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, IMMUNOMODULATORY, CARDIOPROTECTIVE, ANTI-OBESITY AND ANTI-LIPID ACCUMULATION PROPERTIES BUT ITS IMPACT ON GUT MICROBIOME AND GUT HEALTH IS UNKNOWN. IN VIEW OF THIS POTENTIAL, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MUSCADINE GRAPE COULD BE A SUPERIOR SOURCE OF PHYTOCHEMICALS TO MODULATE GUT MICROBIOME AND REDUCE AGE INDUCED &#39;LEAKY GUT&#39;. THIS WOULD PROVIDE A POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH THE REJUVENATIVE EFFECT OF THE MUSCADINE GRAPE, LEARN THE IDENTITY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND ITS POTENTIAL AS A NUTRACEUTICAL FOOD SUPPLEMENT TO AID GUT HEALTH AND PROMOTE HEALTHY AGEING. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PRE- AND PRO-BIOTIC POTENTIAL OF MUSCADINE GRAPE PHYTOCHEMICALS AND ENDOPHYTES IN ENHANCING GUT HEALTH. ACCORDINGLY, THIS STUDY IS AIMED AT EMPLOYING CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGIES TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF MUSCADINE GRAPE FOR AUGMENTING GUT MICROBIOME AND REDUCE AGE RELATED &#39;LEAKY GUT&#39;. THIS RESEARCHWILL UTILIZE MODEL ORGANISM TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF MUSCADINE BERRY EXTRACT, IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE ITS PHYTOCHEMICALS AND ENDOPHYTES WITH A POTENTIAL TO POSITIVELY MODULATE THE QUANTITY, QUALITY, PHYSIOLOGY OF GUT BACTERIA FOR IMPROVING GUT HEALTH.

ONLY FEW ANTHELMINTIOCS ARE FDA-APPROVED FOR USE IN GOATS, AND DUE TO THE COST INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING NEW DRUGS, THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE WAITING PERIOD FOR ONE TO COME ON THE MARKET.PRODUCERS CAN NO LONGER RELY ON ANTHELMINTICS ALONE TO CONTROL INTERNAL PARASITES IN THEIR HERD. THE CONTROL OF GIN IS COSTLY TO THE PRODUCER AND INVOLVES TREATMENT EXPENSES, REDUCED ANIMAL WEIGHT GAIN, AND EVEN DEATH. THROUGH THIS PROJECT, THE HOPE IS FOR A NATURAL AND EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO REDUCE GIN THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY IN CUTTING COST IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MEAT GOATS, MORE GOATS READY FOR MARKET, AND MORE PROFIT FOR THE PRODUCER.

IN A SYNTHESIS OF LITERATURE BY KOVAR ET AL. (2013), IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED NEED FOR AGRICULTURAL LITERACY AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION IN ADDITION TO THAT OF EDUCATORS IN FIELDS NOT SPECIFIC TO AGRICULTURE (KOVAR ET AL, 2013; ANDERSON ET AL, 2014). KOLOSKI AND RITZ (2016) CONDUCTED A NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT DETERMINED AREAS OF FUTURE RESEARCH RELATED TO CTE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF EDUCATOR PREPARATION, 9-12 CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF CTE. THE RESULTS OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT INDICATED SEVERAL THEMES FOR MEASURED IMPROVEMENT: (1) STUDENT SUCCESS BASED ON A VARIETY OF OUTCOMES (CAREER AND ACADEMIC); (2) DEVELOPING COGNITIVE ABILITIES THROUGH CTE LEARNING (3) METHODS FOR CONNECTING CTE CURRICULA TO A RAPIDLY EVOLVINGWORKPLACE (4) CTE ADMINISTRATOR&#39;S/SUPERVISORS DEPTH AND BREADTH OF KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE AND CONCEPT OF CTE (5) SECONDARY ADMINISTRATOR&#39;S PREPARATION FOR LEADING CTE PROGRAMS (KOLOSKI, ET AL, 2016).ELEMENTARY SCHOOL-AGED STUDENTS ARE AT A PRIME AGE FOR INTRODUCTION TO CONCEPTS OF AGRICULTURE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO STEM. EARLY EXPOSURE TO STEM AND SCIENTIFIC PROCESSES SUCH AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE INCREASES STUDENT MOTIVATION TO ENROLL IN ADVANCED MATH AND SCIENCE COURSES WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THIS EXPOSURE PROMOTES AN INCREASE OF CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS, CONFIDENCE BUILDING AND SELF-EFFICACY THAT CAN BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT A 10 STUDENTS&#39; EDUCATIONAL CAREER (DEJARNETTE, 2016). THIS EARLY EXPOSURE TO STEM WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AGRICULTURE DEMONSTRATES THE PROCESSES OF STEM IN AN APPLIED MANNER, ALLOWING STUDENTS TO DRAW CONNECTIONS BETWEEN COURSE CONTENT AND \"REAL-WORLD\" APPLICATIONS. IT ALSO ALLOWS STUDENTS TO BECOME BETTER AWARE OF AGRICULTURAL CAREER PATHWAYS AND BOLSTERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF AGRICULTURE CLUSTER COMPLETION IN SYSTEMS THAT OFFER HIGH SCHOOL AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS.IN ADDITION TO ASSISTING IN THE ACQUISITION OF AGRICULTURAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE, PROJECTS SUCH AS THE AG-STEM INTEGRATED SKILLS INSTITUTE WILL BRIDGE GAPS BETWEEN VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES, COMMUNITY GROUPS AND STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL ALIGN NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS, A NATIONAL SCIENCE CURRICULUM STANDARD, NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR READING AND MATH AND CURRICULUM SPECIFIC TO THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA WITH EXISTING 4-H CURRICULUM TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURAL LITERACY WITHIN THE K-5 EDUCATIONAL SETTING. THIS CURRICULUM INTEGRATION WILL SHOW THE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURE ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF SPECTRUMS AND DISCIPLINES OFTEN OVERLOOKED AS ASSOCIATES OF AGRICULTURE. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO CONNECT LOCAL 4-H EXTENSION AGENTS WITH K-5 TEACHERS AND UNIVERSITY PERSONNEL, ALLOWING FOR THE FOSTERING OF ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS OF MUTUAL BENEFIT. THESE RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUAL TRANSFER OR EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN CONSTITUENT GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT ROLES WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM, FOSTERS EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND PLACES VALUE ON THE UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE OF PRACTICING AGRICULTURALISTS SUCH AS LOCAL FAMERS (GALBREATH, 2015). THIS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURAL KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE AND INCREASE COMMUNITY VIABILITY AND THE SUPPORT THE 2014-2018 NIFA GOALS OF CATALYZING EXEMPLARY AND RELEVANT RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS SERVING AS A MODEL TO BE IMPLEMENTED AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS. THROUGH THESE LINKAGES AND PARTNERSHIPS, THE SHARING OF KNOWLEDGE CAN CREATE A CULTURE THAT IS WELL EQUIPPED TO ADDRESS SOCIETAL CHANGES BY UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES OF RESEARCH, OUTREACH, EDUCATION, EXTENSION AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THESE DISCIPLINES INTERSECT TO INFLUENCE AGRICULTURE (BLUNDOCANTO ET AL., 2019). SIMILARLY, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE GROUPS POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND FUTURE INNOVATION IN ADDITION TO GENERATING NEW IDEAS WHICH HAVE POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE AS CITIZENS BECOME MORE AWARE OF THEIR ROLES AND POTENTIAL CAREERS WITHIN THE DISCIPLINE (PANT, 2012).AGRICULTURAL LITERACY AMONGST THE GENERAL POPULATION AND AMONGST EDUCATORS IS NEEDED THROUGHOUT AS WE WORK TO PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE FOOD AND FIBER SYSTEM TO SUPPORT AN EXPANDING GLOBAL POPULATION. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY PEOPLE NOW HAVE LIMITED INTERACTIONS OR ACCESS TO AGRICULTURE OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONSUMER EXPERIENCES AND MANY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE SYNERGIES BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH (STEM) (KOVAR ET AL, 2013; VALLERA &AMP; BODZIN, 2016). CREATING AN EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING-BASED TRAINING APPROACH TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL LITERACY OF 4-H AGENTS AND K-5 EDUCATORS WILL CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT CONCEPTS OF AGRICULTURE TO THOSE OF STEM THROUGH HANDS-ON PROCESSES ALLOWING PARTICIPANTS TO GARNER, APPLY AND DEVELOP TRANSFERRABLE SKILLS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. BY TRAINING EDUCATORS AND 4-H AGENTS IN THIS PROCESS, THEY WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO TRANSLATE AGRICULTURAL CONCEPTS TO K-5 STUDENT PARTICIPANTS BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO THEIR REGULAR LESSON PLANS, DISCUSSIONS OR ACTIVITIES.

OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT ARE DEFINED AS EXCESSIVE FAT ACCUMULATION AND CLOSELY ASSOCIATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA, INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HYPERTENSION THAT ARE ALL WELL-KNOWN RISK FACTORS FOR VARIOUS DISEASES. IN MAMMALS, BODY WEIGHT AND ENERGY BALANCE ARE REGULATED BY CONTROLLING FOOD INTAKE AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE (EE) THROUGH THE INTERACTIONS OF PERIPHERAL NUTRIENTS AND HORMONES WITH DIFFERENT NEURONAL SUBPOPULATIONS.

HOWEVER, THIS REGION IS THE HOME OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS LIVING UNDER PERSISTENT POVERTY. MANY OF THE RURAL LANDSCAPES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OVER THE YEARS. IN THOSE AREAS, NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY SURFACE MINING, HAVE RESULTED IN SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. FOREST BIOMASS LOSS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY IMPACTS OF MOUNTAIN TOP REMOVAL IN APPALACHIA. THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF TREE SPECIES AND UNDERSTORY VEGETATION ARE KEY INDICATORS OF FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY. WHILE THE MINING INDUSTRY BRINGS JOBS AND INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AFFECTS HUMAN AS WELL AS NATURAL COMMUNITIES. THESE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS INCLUDE REMOVAL OF TOP SOIL AND NEAR-SURFACE MATERIALS; DESTRUCTION OF VEGETATION, BIOMASS, AND BIODIVERSITY; AND POTENTIAL FOR FLOOD, LANDSLIDES, AND OTHER HAZARDS. TOXIC SUBSTANCES IN POLLUTION FROM MINING OPERATIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN LINKED WITH SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, SUCH AS RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND CANCER, IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. LANDSCAPE CHANGES DUE TO EXCESSIVE MINING CAN AFFECT THE PROVISION OF FOREST AND OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, WHICH MAY EVENTUALLY THREATEN THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN NEARBY COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE OF THE DEPENDENCY OF THESE COMMUNITIES ON RENEWABLE AND NON-RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE LANDSCAPE, THE IMPACT OF HISTORICAL MINING ACTIVITIES, AND EMERGING THREATS (SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL INSECURITY), IT IS IMPORTANT TO STUDY HOW MINING ACTIVITIES IN THE PAST HAVE IMPACTED THE FOREST LANDSCAPE, ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE REGION. IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE VULNERABILITY OF THESE COMMUNITIES TO NEW THREATS FROM CHANGES IN NATURAL RESOURCES AND OTHER SUPPORTING SYSTEMS. INADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICS OF THIS UNIQUESYSTEM HAS LIMITED THE ABILITY OF RESEARCHERS TO EXPLAIN LANDSCAPE CHANGES IN THE FUTURE AND THE RESULTING IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION. THIS PROJECT WILL COLLECT RESIDENTS&#39; PERCEPTIONS OF CHANGES IN THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT, ECOSYSTEMS FUNCTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE DUE TO SURFACE MINING ACTIVITIES AND LINK THESE TO THE LAND COVER CHANGE DATA DERIVED FROM THE ANALYSIS OF SATELLITE DATA TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC LOCATIONS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND NEED THE MOST ATTENTION. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO ESTIMATE LOSS IN BIOMASS AND CARBON BALANCE DUE TO SURFACE MINING AND THE EFFECTS ON CLIMATE AND PREDICT RECOVERY TIME OF THE LOST BIOMASS BY ESTIMATING VEGETATION GROWTH IN THE RECLAIMED LAND. THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN-ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIP IN MANY NATURAL RESOURCE-DEPENDENT COMMUNITIES IS VERY COMPLEX AND CAN BE ONLY ADDRESSED BY INTEGRATING HUMAN PERCEPTIONS TO THE PHYSICAL CHANGES ON THE LANDSCAPE. COUPLING AIRBORNE LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING (LIDAR), UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES(DRONES), AND SATELLITE IMAGERY WITH FOREST STAND STRUCTURE AND SPECIES COMPOSITION DATA ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE GROWTH AND LOSS OF IMPORTANT PLANT SPECIES ACROSS THE STUDY SITE AND THEIR OVERALL ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY (I.E., TOTAL BIOMASS OR BIOMASS CHANGES OVER TIME). THE PROPOSAL HAS TWO COMPONENTS. THE RESEARCH COMPONENT OF THE PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING VARIATIONS IN THE CONSEQUENCES OF SURFACE MINING ON ENVIRONMENT, FOREST PRODUCTIVITY, AND FEASIBILITY OF RECLAIMED LANDS FOR AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISES AND THE TEACHING COMPONENT INCLUDES ENHANCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE CURRICULA AT KENTUCKY STATE UNIVERSITY (KSU). KSU WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE-KNOXVILLE (UT) AND TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY (TSU) TO SEEK INPUT FROM LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS VIA FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS AND SURVEYS.

HENCE, LEVERAGING NEW AND EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES TO INFLUENCE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN INCREASING PLANT BREEDING EFFICACY IS KEY TO ADDRESSING THESE INTERESTS. PLANTS EXPOSED TO MAGNETIC FIELDS HAVE SHOWN A VARIETY OF GROWTH RESPONSES. ALTHOUGH MAGNETIC FIELD EXPOSURE EFFECTS TO STIMULATE GROWTH ARE WELL-DOCUMENTED, THE IMPACT OF MAGNETIC FIELD EXPOSURE EFFECTS IN PLANTS IS NOT WELL-UNDERSTOOD. THUS, A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF BIOMAGNETIC RESPONSES IN PLANTS NECESSITATES NEW IN-DEPTH APPROACHES. OUR PRELIMINARY MAGNETIC FIELD EXPOSURE STUDIES RESULTED IN INCREASED BIOMASS PRODUCTION IN DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES THUS SERVING AS A PLATFORM FOR OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH. THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO 1) SCREEN CANDIDATE PLANT GROWTH RESPONSES BASED ON OVERALL BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND SELECTED PHYSIOLOGICAL GROWTH PARAMETERS; 2) IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF MAGNETIC FIELDS IN PLANTS BY TRANSCRIPTOME AND METABOLIC PROFILING AND CHARACTERIZE HOST RESPONSES TO PATHOGENS IN EXPOSED PLANTS; 3) ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF A SIMULATED MARS&#39; MAGNETIC FIELD ON GERMINATION AND PLANT GROWTH. THE PROPOSED STUDY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO 1) CONTRIBUTE TO FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF MAGNETIC FIELD EFFECTS ON CROP DEVELOPMENT; 2) PROVIDE STAKEHOLDERS AND CROP PRODUCERS WITH A VIABLE, SAFER OPTION FOR ENHANCING PLANT BREEDING EFFICACY; 3) PROVIDE STUDENT EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING IN FANH WITH HOPES OF PRODUCING HIGHLY-SKILLED AGRICULTURAL WORKERS; 4) CREATE NEW INSIGHT IN ON THE EFFECTS OF EXTRAPLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELDS ON PLANT BREEDING AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE SPACE TRAVEL; 4)IMPROVE THE EXISTING RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE AT A HISTORIC 1890 RESEARCH AND TEACHING INSTITUTION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "d5d6d6a4-c92b-87da-98e6-196328bf68ef-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_20193882129147_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 78596349, "Award ID": "20193882129146", "Award Amount": 499990.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-02-20", "CFDA Number": "10.216", "Description": "THE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 (EISA) REQUIRES AN AGGRESSIVE SCALE-UP OF CELLULOSIC BIOFUELS AS PART OF THE RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD (RFS) PROGRAM, WITH A PRODUCTION TARGET OF 39.7 BILLION L YR-1 (10.5 BILLION GAL YR-1) BY 2020. HOWEVER, CELLULOSIC BIOFUEL PRODUCTION IS CURRENTLY LESS THAN 10% OF THE 2016 GOAL SET BY EISA. THIS PRODUCTION GAP IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COST OF CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES CURRENTLY BEING COMMERCIALIZED. TWO SPECIFIC BARRIERS ARE THE PROHIBITIVE COSTS OF CELL WALL DEGRADING ENZYMES AND OF BIOMASS PRETREATMENT, BOTH REQUIRED BY EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES AND FEEDSTOCKS. A MAJOR STRATEGIC GOAL IN MAKING COST-COMPETITIVE AND SUSTAINABLE FUELS AND CHEMICALS FROM LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS IS TO REDUCE THE COST OF CELLULOLYTIC ENZYMES AND BIOMASS PRE-TREATMENT WHICH IN TURN HAS LIMITED COMMERCIALIZATION OF BIOMASS FUELS AND CHEMICALS. ONE WAY TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THESE PRODUCTION COSTS IS TO CO-EXPRESS LIGNOLYTIC AND CELLULOLYTIC ENZYMES IN TRANSGENIC DEDICATED BIO-ENERGY CROPS AT LEVELS THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO SIMULTANEOUSLY DECONSTRUCT AND HYDROLYZE LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS.

ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT (NCA), CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON NATURAL RESOURCES, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND THE ENVIRONMENT OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES AND BEYOND. THE LATEST PREDICTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR THE US WAS SUMMARIZED IN THE 3RD NCA REPORT IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING KEY ISSUES FOR THE GREAT PLAINS: (I) RISING TEMPERATURES ARE LEADING TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR WATER AND ENERGY WHICH WILL CONSTRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND STRESS NATURAL RESOURCES, (II) CHANGES TO CROP GROWTH CYCLES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE ALREADY BEEN OBSERVED; AS THE TRENDS CONTINUE, THEY WILL REQUIRE NEW AGRICULTURE/LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, (III) COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE EXTREMES WILL BE STRESSED EVEN FURTHER BY MORE FREQUENT EXTREME EVENTS OCCURRING WITHIN AN ALREADY HIGHLY VARIABLE CLIMATE SYSTEM, AND (IV) EXISTING ADAPTATION AND PLANNING EFFORTS ARE INADEQUATE TO RESPOND TO THESE PROJECTED IMPACTS. THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CLIMATE VARIABILITY ON TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION POSE A GREAT CHALLENGE TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIONS AND SOIL AND WATER QUALITY. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED TO HELP FARMERS AND RANCHERS ADAPT TO THEM AND ALSO TAKE THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO MITIGATE THEIR EFFECTS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF TEXAS AGRICULTURE. THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLIMATE, CROP PRODUCTION AND WATER QUALITY ARE COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING. IN ADDITION, CLIMATE CHANGE HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PLANT HARDINESS ZONE (PHZ), WHICH WILL FURTHER IMPACT PLANT/CROPPING SYSTEMS, CROP YIELDS, AND SOIL AND WATER QUALITY. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND PHZ ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE AS CLIMATE ZONES SHIFT NORTHWARD IN THE COMING CENTURY. THESE POTENTIAL CLIMATE CHANGES CAN ALTER AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, E.G., LOCATIONS OF FARMS OR CROPS, IRRIGATION METHODS AND NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT OR EXPECT LOWER CROP YIELD. THEREFORE, THESE ISSUES NEED STUDY USING INTEGRATED FIELD RESEARCH AND NUMERICAL MODELING APPROACHES.THIS INTEGRATED PROJECT IS AIMED TO STUDY THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON CROP WATER REQUIREMENT, CROP YIELD AND SOIL AND WATER QUALITY.

SINCE 2013, THE U.S. SOUTHERN STATES HAVE WITNESSED A NEW INVASIVE AND DEVASTATING PEST KNOWN AS THE SUGARCANE APHID (SCA) (MELANAPHISSACCHARI) WHICH SEVERELY REDUCES SORGHUM CROP YIELDS, FORAGE QUALITY, AND FEED CONSUMPTION. CURRENTLY, WE ARE USING VISUAL SCORING FOR SUGARCANE APHID PLANT DAMAGE SYMPTOMS, WHICH ARE EXTREMELY, LABOR AND TIME INTENSIVE. THEREFORE, THESE CONSTRAINTS IN FIELD PHENOTYPING HAVE NECESSITATED THE USE OF MACHINES FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPING THAT CAN INCREASE PRECISION IN PHENOTYPING FOR SUGARCANE APHID DAMAGE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUITABLEHIGH-THROUGHPUT (HTP)PLATFORMS SUCH AS ROBOTIC-BASED SYSTEMS CAN BE VERY POWERFUL ANDCURRENTLY,GROUND-BASED FLEETS OF ROBOTS ALLOW USTO MEASURE THE TRAITS OF INTEREST (ESP.

THE RESEARCH COMPONENT WILL INVOLVE XENOGENEICS, A NOVEL METHOD INVOLVING GERM CELL TRANSFER AND TRANSPLANTATION TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE BLACK CRAPPIE X WHITE CRAPPIE HYBRID FRY. THE CRAPPIE IS OF GREAT INTEREST AND COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE TO THE SPORT-FISH INDUSTRY WITHIN ARKANSAS AND THE US. THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO SUCCESSFUL CULTURE AND STOCKING OF CRAPPIE IS THEIR EXTREMELY HIGH REPRODUCTION RATE, WHICH CAN SOON LEAD TO OVERCROWDING AND STUNTING IN COMMERCIAL AQUACULTURE. HYBRID CRAPPIE ARE THE FIRST GENERATION CROSS BETWEEN A BLACK CRAPPIE MALE AND A WHITE CRAPPIE FEMALE. THIS RESULTING HYBRID DISPLAYS LIMITED REPRODUCTION AND INCREASED GROWTH. RESEARCH INDICATES THAT F1 HYBRID CRAPPIE GROWS FASTER AND WEIGH MORE THAN BOTH BLACK CRAPPIE AND WHITE CRAPPIE. HYBRIDS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO GET AS LARGE AS 3 LBS., DEPENDING ON AVAILABLE FORAGE AND FEED. THE CURRENT METHOD OF HYBRID CRAPPIE PRODUCTION INVOLVES HORMONE INDUCED ARTIFICIAL SPAWNING TECHNIQUES. IN THIS METHOD, FEMALE WHITE CRAPPIE ARE INDUCED TO OVULATE WITH THE USE OF A SPAWNING AID. THE EGGS ARE HAND STRIPPED AND COLLECTED. AS MALE CRAPPIE DO NOT RELEASE THEIR SPERM WHEN STRIPPED BY HAND, BLACK CRAPPIE MALES ARE EUTHANIZED, THE TESTES ARE REMOVED AND MACERATED, AND THEN THE TESTICULAR MATERIAL IS MIXED WITH THE EGGS. WATER IS ADDED, AND THE SPERM AND EGGS ARE MIXED TO FERTILIZE. THIS ARTIFICIAL SPAWNING PROCEDURE IS LABOR AND TIME CONSUMING, CAN BE COSTLY, HAVE HIGH EMBRYONIC MORTALITY RATES AND LOW HATCH RATES. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL PROVIDE AN INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HYBRID CRAPPIE VIA NATURAL SPAWNING. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A PROTOCOL FOR THE INTERSPECIFIC TRANSFER OF PRIMORDIAL GERM CELLS (PGCS) BETWEEN THE TWO DIFFERENT SPECIES OF CRAPPIE. WE WILL INVESTIGATE TWO APPROACHES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HYBRID CRAPPIE: FIRST BY TRANSPLANTING BLACK CRAPPIE PGCS INTO TRIPLOID WHITE CRAPPIE MALES SO THAT THEY PRODUCE BLACK CRAPPIE SPERM, AND MATING THEM WITH NORMAL WHITE CRAPPIE FEMALES. THE SECOND APPROACH WILL BE TO TRANSPLANT WHITE CRAPPIE PGCS INTO TRIPLOID BLACK CRAPPIE FEMALES SO THAT THEY PRODUCE WHITE CRAPPIE EGGS, AND MATING THEM WITH NORMAL BLACK CRAPPIE MALES. IF SUCCESSFUL, EITHER OF THESE APPROACHES WOULD RESULT IN THE DESIRED HYBRID THROUGH NATURAL SPAWNING IN CULTURE PONDS. OUR APPROACH IS FIRST TO PRODUCE STERILE WHITE CRAPPIE MALE AND STERILE BLACK CRAPPIE FEMALE HOSTS. STERILITY WILL BE ACHIEVED BY TRIPLOIDIZATION. NEXT DONOR PGC STEM CELLS WILL BE OBTAINED FROM JUVENILE BLACK AND WHITE CRAPPIE BY HARVESTING THEM FROM THEIR GONADS. THE HARVESTED CELLS WILL BE ISOLATED, PROCESSED AND TAGGED SO THAT PGCS CAN BE IDENTIFIED. THE PGC&#39;S WILL THEN BE CRYOPRESERVED FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE, OR TRANSPLANTED INTO THE GONADS OF THE STERILE TRIPLOID HOSTS. BLACK CRAPPIE PGC&#39;S WILL BE TRANSPLANTEDINTO TRIPLOID WHITE CRAPPIE MALES AND WHITE CRAPPIE PGCS INTO TRIPLOID BLACK CRAPPIE FEMALES. THIS TRANSPLANTATION OF PGCS INTO THE HOST SHOULD REESTABLISH THE FERTILITY OF THE XENOGENEIC HOST. HOWEVER, THE HOST WILL PRODUCE GAMETES (EGGS AND SPERM) THAT OF THE DONOR. THE SUCCESS OF THE XENOGENEIC TRANSPLANTATION WILL BE EVALUATED BY LOOKING FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE TAGGED VIABLE PGC, 30,60 AND 90 DAYS POST IMPLANTATION BY SACRIFICING 2-3 FISH, DISSECTING THE GONADS, AND CHECKING FOR THE PRESENCE OF FLUORESCENCE OR BY USING REAL-TIME PCR (QPCR) TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF DONOR GENETIC MATERIAL. CONFIRMATION OF XENOGENESIS WILL BE DONE BY INDUCED SPAWNING OF THE XENOGENIC BROODSTOCKS. SPERM FROM XENOGENEIC WHITE CRAPPIE MALES WILL BE USED TO FERTILIZE EGGS FROM WHITE CRAPPIE FEMALES, AND EGGS FROM XENOGENEIC BLACK CRAPPIE FEMALES WILL BE FERTILIZED WITH BLACK CRAPPIE MALE SPERM. THE PRODUCTION OF BLACK CRAPPIE X WHITE CRAPPIE, HYBRID FRY FROM EITHER OF THESE CROSSES WILL CONFIRM SUCCESSFUL XENOGENESIS. THE FOLLOW UP TO THIS WILL BE NATURAL RACEWAY OR POND SPAWNING OF THE XENOGENEIC BROODSTOCK WITH THEIR CONSPECIFICS TO PRODUCE A NATURALLY SPAWNED F1 HYBRID CRAPPIE POPULATION. A GOAL FOR THE FINAL YEAR OF THIS PROJECT WOULD BE TO ISOLATE CRAPPIE PGCS WITHOUT TAGGING THEM WITH GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (GFP). WE HOPE TO CHARACTERIZE IN DETAIL PGCS ISOLATED USING GFP TO IDENTIFY A DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTIC (I.E., SIZE, VOLUME OR OPTICAL DENSITY) THAT CAN BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GFP. THIS WOULD BE A UNIQUE METHOD TO IDENTIFY AND ISOLATE PGCS IN CRAPPIE WITH THE POTENTIAL OF BEING USED FOR FUTURE RESEARCH WITH ANOTHER TELEOST. IF OUR PROTOCOL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE CRAPPIE HYBRID IS SUCCESSFUL, THIS WILL REPRESENT THE FIRST APPLICATION OF THIS BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY IN SPORT-FISH. AS THIS IS A RESEARCH AND EXTENSION INTEGRATED PROJECT, DIFFERENT STAGES OF SEED PRODUCTION, TRIPLOID PRODUCTION, HYBRID PRODUCTION AND NATURAL POND SPAWNING WILL BE DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH FISH PRODUCERS AND INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS. THE OUTCOMES FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE DISSEMINATED VIA A SERIES OF PUBLICATIONS, POSTERS, AND PRESENTATIONS. THE OUTCOMES FROM THE RESEARCH COMPONENTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE PRESENTED AND DISSEMINATED TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY BY PUBLISHING THE RESULTS, PROTOCOLS, AND DATA IN PEER-REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS.

WHILE THESE SYSTEMS ARE TRADITIONALLY SEPARATE, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL TO SYMBIOTICALLY INTEGRATE THESE THAT WILL MORE EFFECTIVELY RECYCLE NUTRIENTS, CREATE BETTER QUALITY PRODUCTS, ALLOW FOR YEAR-ROUND PRODUCTION AND INCREASE SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME TO FARMERS. A MAJOR DRAWBACK TO BFT IS EXCESSIVE ACCUMULATION OF BIOFLOCS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT WATER QUALITY AND THE HEALTH OF THE ANIMAL. MEANWHILE, A MAJOR DRAWBACK TO AQUAPONICS IS INADEQUATE AVAILABILITY OF MICRO-NUTRIENTS LEADING TO LOWER PRODUCTION.

OILS CONTAINING HIGH PERCENTAGE OF LINOLEIC ACID ARE PRONE TO OXIDATION, LEADING TO RANCIDITY, OFF FLAVORS, AND SHORT SHELF-LIFE. OLEIC ACID HAS 10-FOLD HIGHER AUTO-OXIDATIVE STABILITY THAN LINOLEIC ACID; THEREFORE, HIGH O/L PEANUT HAS A LONGER SHELF LIFE. OILS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF OLEIC ACID ARE ALSO NUTRITIONALLY BENEFICIAL. THEREFORE, EFFORTS TO INCREASE OLEIC ACID CONTENT IN PEANUT SEEDS WILL PROVIDE A BETTER QUALITY AND HEALTHIER OIL FOR CONSUMERS. PRECISE MODIFICATION OF THE TARGET GENES IN A GIVEN GENOME BY THE CRISPR/CAS SYSTEM PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT TOOL TO VALIDATE SPECIFIC GENE FUNCTION OR MODIFY KNOWN GENES.

A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED MINORITY DIETITIANS CAN POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES IN LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THE U.S. ECONOMY. DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS IN THE RACIAL/ETHNIC COMPOSITION AND THE GROWING POPULATION OF ELDERLY AND OBESE INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS WILL REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF DIETITIANS FROM A DIVERSE BACKGROUND. REGISTERED DIETITIANS AS A GROUP ARE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE, WHITE/NON-HISPANIC OR LATINO, AND IN THEIR MID-40S; A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION IS CONSIDERING RETIREMENT BY 2019. AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE POPULATION WILL DEMAND A MORE DIVERSE DIETETIC WORKFORCE, WHICH WILL ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A MORE FOCUSED EFFORT TO RECRUIT, TRAIN, AND RETAIN PRACTITIONERS FROM A VARIETY OF RACIAL, ETHNIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS. AS HEALTH CARE SERVICES CONSUME A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF FEDERAL AND CORPORATE EXPENDITURES, HEALTH CARE AGENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE COSTS THROUGH HEALTH PROMOTION AND EARLY NUTRITION INTERVENTION. HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION EFFORTS WILL LIKELY PLAY A LARGER ROLE IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES, THUS CREATING MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGISTERED DIETITIANS (RDS) AND DIETETIC TECHNICIAN, REGISTERED (DTRS) IN PREVENTIVE CARE AND WELLNESS. INCREASINGLY, DIETETICS SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED IN MORE DIVERSE SETTINGS, SUCH AS WORKSITES, COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS, AND HOME CARE AGENCIES. WHILE THE DEMAND FOR REGISTERED DIETITIANS CONTINUES TO EXPAND, THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES FROM DIETETICS PROGRAMS, ESPECIALLY FROM HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES (HBCU) HAS DECLINED. THE NATIONAL SHORTAGE OF MINORITY DIETITIANS IS PARTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LACK OF DIETETIC INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS FROM 1890 INSTITUTIONS TO COMPLETE THE REQUIRED SUPERVISED PRACTICE PORTION PRIOR TO SITTING FOR THE REGISTRATION EXAMINATION. MAY OF THE HBCUS DO NOT HAVE MEDICAL SCHOOLS OR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES THAT CAN PROVIDE CLINICAL EXPERIENCES TO STUDENTS AND POTENTIAL GRADUATES. SINCE THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE LOW NUMBER OF GRADUATES FROM HBCUS WHO ENTER THE DIETETIC PROFESSION IS THE LACK OF INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATES, TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM, DSU APPROVED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COORDINATED PROGRAM IN DIETETICS (CPD) IN OCTOBER OF 2015. THE CPD WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO COMPLETE BOTH THE DIDACTIC PORTION AND THE SUPERVISED PRACTICE PORTION OF THEIR EDUCATION AT DSU. THE CPD EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM ALLOWS STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THE CLINICAL, COMMUNITY, AND MANAGEMENT SUPERVISED PRACTICE PORTION OF THEIR PROGRAM DURING THEIR UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES LIKE THE NURSING PROGRAM. TO INCREASE INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS AND STRENGTHEN THE CPD PROGRAM, THIS PROJECT PROPOSES TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH HEALTHCARE FACILITIES (HOSPITALS, NURSING HOMES, AND FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS) TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO VITAL EXPERIENCES THAT STUDENTS NEED TO MEET PATIENT/CLIENT NEEDS.

AS MORE STUDENTS ENTER ANIMAL SCIENCE PROGRAMS WITH NONAGRICULTURAL BACKGROUNDS, IT IS VERY IMPERATIVE TO PROVIDE BASIC ANIMAL HUSBANDRY SKILLS THROUGH EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING ACTIVITIES TO ENHANCE THEIR PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. PRECONDITIONING OF BEEF CALVES IS A HIGHLY INTERACTIVE YET A SHORT DURATION PROGRAM IDEALLY SUITED FOR THIS PURPOSE. INCREASED PROFITABILITY TO SMALL PRODUCER OPERATIONS REQUIRES PRODUCERS WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPROVE HERDS&#39; PERFORMANCE BY SYNCHRONIZING BREEDING AND PRECONDITIONING CALVES FOR ABOUT 45 DAYS; THUS, IMPROVING MANAGEMENT, ADDING VALUE, AND RECEIVING BETTER PRICES.

IT IS THE STAPLE FOOD FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE WORLD&#39;S POPULATION. THE YIELD OF ANY AGRICULTURAL CROP IS AFFECTED BY SOIL CONDITIONS. SOIL SALINITY IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF CROP LOSSES. YIELD LOSSES OF 12 BILLION USD ARE ATTRIBUTED TO SOIL SALINITY. THE USA IS AMONG THE TOP FIVE RICE-EXPORTING COUNTRIES. SPECIFICALLY ARKANSAS, CALIFORNIA, LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI, MISSOURI AND TEXAS PRODUCE 20 BILLION POUNDS OF RICE IN THE UNITED STATES. MORE IMPORTANTLY, RICE-GROWING AREAS IN CALIFORNIA AND LOUISIANA ARE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY SALINITY.BASIC SCIENTIFIC DOGMA INFORMS US THAT THE FLOW OF INFORMATION IN AN ORGANISM IS FROM THE GENE (DNA) COPY OR TRANSCRIBED TO THE MESSAGE (MRNA), WHICH IS THEN TRANSLATED TO THE PRODUCT. DNA ANALYSIS HAS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF GENES THAT ARE INDUCED IN RESPONSE TO SALINITY AND IT WAS THOUGHT THAT MANIPULATION OF THESE GENES MIGHT IMPROVE PLANT STRESS TOLERANCE. HOWEVER, OVEREXPRESSION OF THESE GENES RESULTED IN ONLY MARGINAL IMPROVEMENTS IN SALINITY TOLERANCE UNDER DEFINED LABORATORY CONDITIONS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A NOT A DIRECT TRANSLATION OF THE MRNA AND THAT AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF SALINITY TOLERANCE IS NECESSARY FOR BIOTECHNOLOGICAL MANIPULATION OF PLANT SALT TOLERANCE. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CLOSELY RELATED GENOTYPES WITH CONTRASTING SALT TOLERANCE MAY LEAD TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SALINITY TOLERANCE AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL.NOT ALL THE DNA IN EUKARYOTES (PLANTS, FUNGI AND ANIMALS AS OPPOSED TO BACTERIA) IS TRANSLATED INTO PRODUCT OR PROTEIN. THE OTHER RNAS NOT TRANSLATED SERVE MANY OTHER REGULATORY AND HOUSEKEEPING FUNCTIONS IN HIGHER ORDER EUKARYOTES. ONCE THEIR FUNCTION IS PERFORMED THESE ARE DEGRADED OR DECAY INTO SINGLE NUCLEOTIDES THAT MADE UP THE RNA. SOME OF THESE RNAS ARE NOT COMPLETELY DEGRADED AND SHORT FRAGMENTS OF RNA, WHICH ARE LONG - LIVED, REMAIN WITH IN THE CELL. SOME OF THESE ARE KNOWN AS MIRNAS.MIRNA OR SMALL NON-CODING FRAGMENTS OF RNA ARE NOW KNOWN TO SILENCE OR DOWNREGULATE GENE EXPRESSION IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.THESE MAY INCLUDE TRANSLATIONAL REPRESSION, MRNA CLEAVAGE, OR DEADENYLATION. MIRNAS ARE ABOUT 22 NUCLEOTIDES IN LENGTH AND HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN VARIOUS ORGANISMS THROUGH RANDOM CLONING AND SEQUENCING OR COMPUTATIONAL PREDICTION.WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES IN SOIL SALINITY TOLERANCE BY IDENTIFYING MIRNAS THAT MAYBE IMPORTANT IN POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF GENES IN INVOLVED IN WITHSTANDING HIGH SALINE SOILS. SINCE, RICE IS A CEREAL USED GLOBALLY AND RICE BREEDING HAS A LONG HISTORY (10 000 YEARS), THERE ARE MANY GENOTYPES WITH SPECIFIC TRAITS FOR ALMOST ANY BIOTIC OR ABIOTIC STRESS. THE TECHNIQUE THAT WILL BE EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY THESE MIRNAS IS DEGRADOME ANALYSIS.WE WILL UTILIZE TWO WELL-CHARACTERIZED RICE GENOTYPES WITH CONTRASTING SALT SENSITIVITIES, I.E., SALT-TOLERANT LANDRACE \"POKKALI\" AND SALT-SENSITIVE \"IR29\" TO DISCOVER AND CHARACTERIZE MIRNAS IMPORTANT IN SALT TOLERANCE EXPRESSION.WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MICRORNA (MIRNA)-GUIDED GENE REGULATION IS A MAJOR CAUSE FOR DIFFERENTIAL GENE REGULATION THAT IS OBSERVED IN THESE GENOTYPES UNDER SALINITY. COMPARATIVE PROFILES OF MIRNAS AND THEIR MRNA TARGETS IN THESE GENOTYPES SHOULD ELUCIDATE THE MIRNA-DEPENDENT POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL GENE REGULATIONS THAT ARE DIFFERENT IN TOLERANT GENOTYPES.WE PLAN TO IDENTIFY MIRNAS THAT ARE DIFFERENTIALLY REGULATED DURING SALINITY BY CREATING AND PROFILING SMALL RNA LIBRARIES, DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF SALINITY-REGULATED MIRNAS ON TARGET MRNAS BY ANALYZING \"DEGRADOME\" LIBRARIES, AND DETERMINE MIRNA-MEDIATED SALINITY TOLERANCE MECHANISMS BY COMPARING THE MIRNA AND DEGRADOME PROFILES OF POKKALI AND IR29.IN ORDER TO BUILD CAPACITY AT LANGSTON UNIVERSITY AND INVOLVE AS MANY STAKEHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE, LANGSTON UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WILL BE INVOLVED IN CUTTING EDGE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR TECHNIQUES AND RESEARCH IN PLANT BIOLOGY.

THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF GENOME EDITING OF SWEETPOTATO, A SIX CHROMOSOME-SET VEGETATIVELY PROPAGATED CROP, THROUGH 4 OBJECTIVES: 1) DESIGN AND ASSEMBLE GENE EDITING CONSTRUCTS; 2) TEST THE EFFICACY OF THESE CONSTRUCTS THROUGH CELL PROTOPLAST TRANSFECTION; 3) PERFORM STABLE AGROBACTERIUM-MEDIATED SWEETPOTATO TRANSFORMATION, AND; 4) DETECT AND VALIDATE THE RESULTING GENETIC CHANGES, WHILE TRAINING STUDENTS AND FACULTY. THIS EXPLORATORY RESEARCH WILL USE CRISPR TECHNOLOGY WITH A SINGLE OR TWO SGRNA CONSTRUCTS TO TARGET SITES THAT CAN BE EDITED SIMULTANEOUSLY, CAUSING MUTATION OF THE GENE OR DELETION OF THE GENE FRAGMENT BETWEEN THE TWO TARGET SITES. THE DESIGN AND ASSEMBLY OF THIS MULTIPLEX CRISPR/CAS9-SGRNA SYSTEM WILL CONTRIBUTE NOT ONLY TO SWEETPOTATO, BUT ALSO TO OTHER ROOT CROP GENETIC IMPROVEMENT. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL ALSO TEST THE EFFICIENCY OF DISRUPTING MULTIPLE GENE COPIES IN A MULTIPLE CHROMOSOME SET SPECIES AND VERIFY THE ROLES OF MOLECULAR COMPONENTS INVOLVED IN PLANT DISEASE RESISTANCE AND PLANT DEVELOPMENT. THE INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THIS STUDY WILL POTENTIALLY IMPROVE MARKER-ASSISTED BREEDING PROTOCOLS PROVIDING DIRECT BENEFITS FOR CROP PRODUCERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT WILL HELP ALLEVIATE THE BREEDING BOTTLENECKS OFTEN PRESENT IN UNDERFUNDED AND UNDERSTUDIED STAPLE CROPS. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS INNOVATIVE IN THAT IT WILL DEVELOP THE TOOLS TO CONDUCT SWEETPOTATO GENOME EDITING AND, EVENTUALLY, TRANSLATE THIS KNOWLEDGE INTO PRECISION PLANT BREEDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS FOR FOOD AND INDUSTRIAL FEEDSTOCK PRODUCTION. THIS EXPLORATORY PROJECT ON CRISPR/CAS-MEDIATED SWEETPOTATO GENOME EDITINGREPRESENTS A NEW STRATEGY TO IMPROVE SWEETPOTATO, PREDICTABLY, BUILD THE FARMING CAPACITY, AND BRIDGE THE TECHNOLOGICAL GAP MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE ORPHAN CROPS. THIS WILL, IN TURN, ACCELERATE BREEDING AND MANY IMPORTANT ENDEAVORS IN BUILDING 1890 LAND GRANT UNIVERSITY RESEARCH CAPACITY.

NGS HAS MARKEDLY ACCELERATED NUMEROUS FIELDS OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH, ENABLING RESEARCHERS TO PURSUE EXPERIMENTS THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE NOT TECHNICALLY AFFORDABLE. DESPITE THE PROMISE OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, THERE HAS BEEN ONLY LIMITED RESEARCH IN FOODS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THAT WILL EMPOWER THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF FOOD SAFETY RESEARCH. TOWARD THIS AIM A NEW MULTIDISCIPLINARY COURSE REINFORCING APPLICATIONS OF GENOMICS FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE FOOD AND NUTRITIONAL SCIENCE MAJOR WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE NEW COURSE WILL CONTAIN PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, GENOMICS, AND ITS APPLICATIONS TO FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION. THE COURSE WILL CONSIST OF BOTH LECTURES AND LABS. IN ADDITION, SUMMER LABORATORY WORKSHOPS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR STUDENTS AT LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS AND THROUGH THE 4-H PROGRAM TO PROVIDE DEEPERSCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND MOTIVATION THROUGH HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO ATTRACT STUDENTS&#39; INTEREST IN FOOD SCIENCE AND AGRICULTURAL MAJORS. THE PROJECT FURTHER ENABLES GRADUATE STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN AND DRIVE EXPERIMENTS APPLYING THE NGS TECHNIQUE TO IDENTIFY THE BACTERIAL SPECIES OF FISHERY PRODUCTS TREATED WITH NATURAL PRESERVATIVES. CATFISH WILL BE TREATED WITH THE FOUR KINDS OF NATURAL PRESERVATIVES DURING STORAGE IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND BACTERIAL DIVERSITY OF THE FISH MICROFLORA WILL BE DETERMINED FOLLOWING NGS ASSAY. INNOVATIVE COURSEWORK AND APPLIED RESEARCH ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT WILL SYNERGIZE TO INCREASE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS&#39; KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCE IN CUTTING-EDGE MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROVIDING SKILLS THAT CAN LEAD TO NEW CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES.
