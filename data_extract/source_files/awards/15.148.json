THE DEPARTMENT ALSO HAS CONSTRUCTION CREWS THAT MAINTAIN AND CONSTRUCT ROADS AND THE WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS, SERVICES THAT A UTILITY WILL NEED. THIS PROJECT REPRESENTS ANOTHER STEP IN OUR TRIBES JOURNEY TOWARD SELF SUFFICIENCY AND CONTRIBUTES TO ALL THREE INGREDIENTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. ESTABLISHING A TUA WILL INCREASE OUR TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY, EMPOWER OUR TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS TO MAKE DECISIONS AND ADMINISTER POLICY, AND ALIGN THE TRIBES INSTITUTIONS (IN THIS CASE, A TUA) WITH OUR VALUES BY EXPLORING MORE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY RESOURCES.TEDC GRANT FUNDS WILL SUPPORT THE TRIBE IN (1) ASSESSING THE CURRENT STATE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND UTILITY SERVICES  (2) ASSESSING ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND IDENTIFYING TECHNOLOGIES WITH PREFERENCE ON RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES, SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND  (3) ASSESSING POWER NEEDS FOR TWO AREAS ON THE RESERVATION (I.E., ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF THE FIRST UTILITY DISTRICTS)  (4) DRAFTING A CHARTER FOR THE TUA  AND (5) PROVIDING A FINAL RECOMMENDATION REPORT AND ROADMAP FOR MOVING FORWARD. THE WHITE EARTH BAND OF CHIPPEWA EXPECTS THIS PROJECT TO REINFORCE OUR TRIBES COMMITMENT TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGING TRIBAL LANDS TO PROMOTE ENVIRONMENT SUSTAINABILITY, CREATE JOBS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR COMMUNITY, AND INCREASE ENERGY RESILIENCE WHILE LOWERING ENERGY COSTS FOR THE TRIBE AND ITS TRIBAL MEMBERS.
