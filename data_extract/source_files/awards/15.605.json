ACCORDING TO THE 2011 NATIONAL SURVEY OF FISHING, HUNTING, AND WILDLIFE-ASSOCIATED RECREATION (USDOI 2013) AN ESTIMATED 1.7 MILLION FRESHWATER ANGLERS ACCUMULATED OVER 23.8 MILLION ANGLING DAYS ON PONDS, LAKES, AND RESERVOIRS IN CALIFORNIA AND ANGLERS CONTRIBUTED OVER  2.3 BILLION TO THE STATE S ECONOMY FROM FISHING RELATED EXPENSES.ALTHOUGH SEEMINGLY HIGH, THE NUMBER OF ANGLERS IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR THE PAST DECADE. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS FOR THE DECLINING PARTICIPATION IN ANGLING HAS NOT BEEN WELL INVESTIGATED. IN 1988, FLETCHER AND KING (1988) REPORTED THAT, IN GENERAL, CALIFORNIA ANGLERS STOPPED FISHING DUE TO A LACK OF FREE TIME. HOWEVER, THE 18-24-YEAR-OLD AGE SUBGROUP CITED A LOSS OF INTEREST AS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR NO LONGER FISHING. LOSS OF INTEREST MAY RELATE TO POOR ANGLER SATISFACTION, WHICH WAS MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY NOT CATCHING ENOUGH FISH. IN A LATER STUDY OF 14 CALIFORNIA RESERVOIRS STOCKED WITH SALMONIDS, 78  OF ANGLERS CONTACTED WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR OVERALL ANGLING EXPERIENCE, BUT APPROXIMATELY HALF OF ANGLERS CONTACTED WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH EITHER THE SIZE OR NUMBER OF FISH CAUGHT (LEE 2003). SATISFACTION METRICS DID NOT SHOW A STRONG TREND OVER TIME IN EITHER DIRECTION. HOWEVER, THE STAGNANT AND MEDIOCRE LEVELS OF SATISFACTION IN FISH SIZE AND CATCH RATE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RECENT DECLINE IN ANGLING PARTICIPATION.LAKE AND RESERVOIR FISHERIES COMPRISE A LARGE PORTION OF THE RECREATIONAL FISHING EFFORT IN CALIFORNIA. BETWEEN THE YEARS OF 2010 AND 2019, THE SALE OF FISHING LICENSES IN CALIFORNIA HAS GENERATED BETWEEN  36,239,087 - 46,283,404 IN REVENUE. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE COST OF A SPORT-FISHING LICENSE HAS RISEN ANNUALLY EXCEPT FOR 2015 - 2017 WHEN IT REMAINED THE SAME. ONE COMMON COMPLAINT THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENCOUNTER FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS IS THE LIMITED NUMBER AND TYPE OF GAME FISH AVAILABLE TO ANGLERS. THIS PERCEIVED ISSUE CAUSES A MAJOR PROBLEM IN PROVIDING SATISFACTORY FISHING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANGLERS BY RECREATIONAL FISHING MANAGERS. NOT CATCHING ENOUGH FISH IS OFTEN THE GREATEST DETRACTOR FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF FISHING. FISHERY METHODS AND TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING ANGLER CATCHES ARE NUMEROUS AND LEE (1993) DESCRIBED VARIOUS LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES COMMONLY USED IN CALIFORNIA. TO DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF THESE STRATEGIES AND TO HELP DEVELOP NEW STRATEGIES, INFORMATION ON LAKE AND RESERVOIR PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PARAMETERS, FISH POPULATIONS, ANGLER SUCCESS AND CATCH, AND ANGLER ATTITUDES AND PREFERENCES ARE NEEDED.EVEN THOUGH LAKE AND RESERVOIR FISHERIES COMPRISE A LARGE PORTION OF THE RECREATIONAL FISHING EFFORT IN CALIFORNIA, THERE IS A LACK OF DATA ON FISH POPULATION DYNAMICS OF GAME FISHES IN MANY OF THE STATE S WATERS. INFORMATION ON SPORT FISH SPECIES ABUNDANCE, AGE, SIZE STRUCTURE, ANGLER SUCCESS AND HARVEST, AND THE SIZE OF NATURAL-SPAWNING POPULATIONS IS NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ANGLING OPPORTUNITIES.IN SOME WATERS THE INTRODUCTION OF AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES (AIS) CREATES THREATS TO DESIRABLE FISHERY RESOURCES.

DUE TO CONCERNS OVER THE DECLINE OF WHITE SEABASS LANDINGS IN THE MID-LATE 1900 S, THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED THE OCEAN RESOURCES ENHANCEMENT AND HATCHERY PROGRAM (OREHP) IN 1983, UNDER CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME CODE, SECTION 6590, ET. SEQ. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE OREHP WAS TO CONDUCT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH INTO THE ARTIFICIAL PROPAGATION, REARING, AND STOCKING OF IMPORTANT MARINE FINFISH SPECIES OCCURRING IN OCEAN WATERS OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE YEARS, THE LEGISLATURE HAS AMENDED THE INTENT LANGUAGE OF THE PROGRAM. CURRENT LEGISLATION FOCUSES ON ADVANCING RESEARCH IN DETERMINING IF HATCHERY RELEASED FISH CAN ENHANCE IMPORTANT RECREATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL SPECIES THROUGH INCREASED PRODUCTION OF FISH AND INCREASED MONITORING OF FISHERIES TO ASSESS THE HATCHERY CONTRIBUTION. THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATION IS TO ENHANCE POPULATIONS OF MARINE FINFISH SPECIES IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR SPORT AND COMMERCIAL FISHING VALUE. WHITE SEABASS HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF THIS RESEARCH SINCE 1990.THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (CDFW) ADMINISTERS THE OREHP, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A 10-MEMBER OCEAN RESOURCES ENHANCEMENT ADVISORY PANEL (OREAP). THE OREAP CONSISTS OF ACADEMIC AND MANAGEMENT AGENCY SCIENTISTS, REPRESENTATIVES OF BOTH COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHING GROUPS, THE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY, AND NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION INTERESTS. CDFW ALSO EMPLOYS A RESEARCH SCIENTIST (FISH PATHOLOGIST) TO INVESTIGATE AND MANAGE DISEASE ISSUES WITH THE OREHP.CDFW S MAIN CONTRACTOR IS HUBBS-SEAWORLD RESEARCH INSTITUTE (HSWRI). HSWRI OWNS AND OPERATES THE MARINE FISH HATCHERY (LEON RAYMOND HUBBARD, JR., MARINE FISH HATCHERY). HSWRI HAS DEVELOPED THE CULTURE PROTOCOLS REQUIRED FOR THE PROGRAM AND ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES REQUIRED TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF HATCHERY-REARED FISH ON THE WILD FISHERY. THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE HATCHERY IS TO PROVIDE JUVENILE WHITE SEABASS TO GROWOUT FACILITIES OPERATED BY VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS AND HSWRI. THE HATCHERY CAN PRODUCE SEVERAL MILLION JUVENILE WHITE SEABASS ANNUALLY  HOWEVER, CURRENT RELEASE GOALS ARE SET AT UP TO 350,000 JUVENILE WHITE SEABASS PER YEAR. SPECIFIC RELEASE GOALS ARE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ADULT BROODSTOCK FISH AVAILABLE AND THE POTENTIAL GENETIC IMPACT OF HATCHERY RELEASES ON WILD WHITE SEABASS STOCKS.IN ADDITION TO HSWRI, THE OREHP RECEIVES CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT (5,000  HOURS PER YEAR) FROM VOLUNTEERS, PRIMARILY RECREATIONAL ANGLER AND EDUCATIONAL GROUPS, WHO OWN AND OPERATE ELEVEN GROWOUT FACILITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THESE GROWOUT FACILITIES PROVIDE A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO INCREASE POST-RELEASE SURVIVAL RATE BY RELEASING LARGER WHITE SEABASS.IN 2017, CALIFORNIA SEA GRANT (CASG) COMPLETED A MULTI-YEAR EVALUATION OF THE OREHP TO DETERMINE IF THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL AND COST-EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR WHITE SEABASS ENHANCEMENT AND MANAGEMENT.

KODIAK OFFERS A YEAR-ROUND ICE-FREE HARBOR AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO FISH FOR FIVE SPECIES OF PACIFIC SALMON, ESPECIALLY THE PRIZED KING SALMON, AS WELL AS HALIBUT, ROCKFISH, AND MANY OTHER MARINE FISH SPECIES.RECREATIONAL BOATERS CURRENTLY USE TWO BOAT RAMPS LOCATED IN THE CITY OF KODIAK TO LAUNCH AND RETRIEVE TRAILER-ABLE BOATS. ONE AT ST. PAUL BOAT HARBOR LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN AND ONE AT ST. HERMAN HARBOR LOCATED ON NEAR ISLAND. ST. PAUL IS A MUCH SMALLER FACILITY WITH LIMITED ACCESS DUE TO ACCESSIBILITY AT LOW TIDE. ST. HERMAN IS A BUSY HARBOR THAT CAN REQUIRE LONG WAITING PERIODS TO ACCESS THE BOAT RAMP DURING PEAK TIMES AS IT HAS TWO PAVED RAMPS WITH WIDER AND LONGER DOCK.DURING 2022, 1266 INDIVIDUAL BOAT LAUNCHES OCCURRED AT THE KODIAK ST. PAUL HARBOR RAMP. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LAUNCHES TALLIED REPRESENTS A MINIMUM, AS IT DOES NOT INCLUDE BOATERS THAT ARE IN NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE LAUNCH FEE SCHEDULE OR MULTIPLE LAUNCHES BY SEASON PASS HOLDERS EACH YEAR.

THE RAMP IS SHOWN ON EXISTING PROJECT DRAWINGS FOR THE RAMP FLOAT DATED 1979. THE RAMP IS COMPOSED OF PRECAST CONCRETE PLANKS BEARING ON TREATED TIMBERS. SOMETIME AFTER CONSTRUCTION THE JOINTS BETWEEN SEVERAL OF THE CONCRETE PLANKS WERE GROUTED WHICH HAS REDUCED THE FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN A FEW THE PLANKS AND POTENTIALLY LEAD TO INCREASE WEAR IN THE PLANKS DUE TO SETTLEMENT BELOW THE RAMP. THE DAMAGED PLANKS WERE PREVIOUSLY REPAIRED AND OR REPLACED IN 1998, BUT THE RAMP ITSELF IS NOW EXCEEDING ITS USEFUL LIFE EXPECTANCY.SITE INSPECTIONS IN DECEMBER 2020 AND MARCH 2021 DETERMINED THE MAJORITY OF THE CONCRETE PLANKS TO BE WORN AND NO LONGER PROVIDING A SAFE SURFACE FOR VEHICLES WHILE LAUNCHING VESSELS. DUE TO A COMBINATION OF UNDERMINING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RAMP FROM DREDGING IN THE HARBOR AND THE FAILURE OF THE HOOK AND EYE SYSTEM LINKING THE PLANKS, SEVERAL OF THE BOTTOM PLANKS HAVE ALSO SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AND BECOME DISPLACED. THE SEPARATED PLANKS HAVE BECOME A HAZARD AND RESULTED IN MULTIPLE VEHICLES BECOMING STUCK ON THE RAMP DURING USAGE AT LOWER TIDES, THE ISSUE OF THE SEPARATED PLANKS HAS BEEN COMPOUNDED BY EFFECTIVE RAISING OF THE RAMP BY TECTONIC REBOUND THAT HAS CONTINUED FROM THE 1964 GREAT ALASKA EARTHQUAKE. THE ACCOMPANYING FLOAT, ALTHOUGH USABLE, IS WORN AND NARROWER THAN RECOMMENDED BY CURRENT DESIGN STANDARDS.BASED ON THE SITE INSPECTIONS IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE LAUNCH RAMP BE REPLACED BY A NEW CONCRETE PANEL RAMP OF SIMILAR WIDTH (16 FEET WIDE) BUT BE EXTENDED TO IN LENGTH TO BETTER ACCOMMODATE LAUNCHINGS AT LOW TIDE. IT WAS ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT AT THE TIME OF THE RAMP REPLACEMENT THE PILE, ABUTMENTS, AND FLOAT ALSO BE REPLACED.

SIGNIFICANT ALTERATIONS TO STREAM CHANNELS BEGAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH STARTING IN 1849. TODAY URBAN EXPANSION, AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND WATER OPERATIONS CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THESE POPULATIONS. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (CDFW), AS TRUSTEE AGENCY FOR THE STATE S FISH AND WILDLIFE RESOURCES, NOT ONLY MANAGES CATCHABLE STOCKS AND HARVEST OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO HAS BEEN STEADILY WORKING TO REVERSE POPULATION DECLINES IN ANADROMOUS STOCKS. SINCE THE LATE 1980 S SEVERAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS RECOGNIZED THESE DECLINES AND WERE TARGETED AT REVERSING THEM. THESE INCLUDE THE STATE SALMON, STEELHEAD TROUT, AND ANADROMOUS FISHERIES PROGRAM ACT OF 1988, FEDERAL CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991, AND THE WATER RESOURCES AND DELTA RESTORATION ACT OF 1996. PRIOR TO THE 1940 S, IT IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT SPRING-RUN CHINOOK SALMON WERE THE DOMINANT SALMON RUN IN THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER BASIN (SJRB). FROM THE 1940 S THRU THE 1980 S, MAJOR CHANGES IN WATER USE AND DELIVERY OCCURRED. THE CUMULATIVE RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN THE EXTIRPATION OF SELF-SUSTAINING STOCKS OF SPRINGRUN CHINOOK SALMON, THE NEAR EXTIRPATION OF STEELHEAD (A SPECIES LISTED AS THREATENED BY THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT), AND THE SUBSTANTIAL CURTAILMENT OF FALL-RUN CHINOOK SALMON PRODUCTION SINCE 2000 (I.E., CURRENTLY A CANDIDATE SPECIES FOR LISTING REVIEW UNDER THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT). TODAY FALL-RUN CHINOOK SALMON ARE THE DOMINATE RUN OF ANADROMOUS SALMONIDS REMAINING IN THE SJRB, AND THAT RUN IS A SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF. CONCURRENT WITH RECENT DECLINES IN BOTH THE SALMON AND STEELHEAD RUNS HAS BEEN THE REDUCTION OF ANGLING OPPORTUNITY AND SUCCESS, AS RESOURCE MANAGERS HAVE HAD TO CURTAIL SEASONS, EVENTUALLY REDUCING BAG LIMITS TO ZERO IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE REMAINING SALMON AND STEELHEAD STOCKS STILL PRESENT IN SAN JOAQUIN RIVER BASIN TRIBUTARIES (E.G., STANISLAUS, TUOLUMNE, AND MERCED RIVERS). IN RECENT TIMES, THE SACRAMENTO FALL-RUN HAS ALSO HAD SEVERE DECLINES AND OCEAN FISHING WAS CURTAILED ALMOST COMPLETELY. THE SJRB, IN RECENT HISTORY, IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADULT SALMON. IT IS BELIEVED THAT GREATER, AND MORE FREQUENT PRODUCTION OF LARGE NUMBERS OF ADULT SALMON AND STEELHEAD IS POSSIBLE (I.E., PRODUCTION DEFINED AS ADULT SALMON AND STEELHEAD ESCAPING INTO THE TRIBUTARIES TO SPAWN).

MANAGEMENT OF THESE IN-RIVER FISHERIES AS WELL AS THE EVALUATION OF OCEAN FISHERIES HARVEST RATES RELIES UPON INFORMATION REGARDING THE ROBUSTNESS OF INDIVIDUAL STOCKS AND THE FRESHWATER HABITATS UPON WHICH THEY DEPEND. THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE S (NMFS) ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT (ESA) SECTION 7(A) (2) CURRENT BIOLOGICAL OPINION ANTICIPATES INCIDENTAL TAKE OF ESA-LISTED SOUTHERN OREGON   NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST (SONCC) COHO SALMON TO OCCUR EACH YEAR IN SALMON FISHERIES. UNDER THE PROPOSED ACTION, THE PACIFIC FISHERIES MANAGEMENT COUNCIL SHALL CONSTRAIN TOTAL EXPLOITATION RATE OF SONCC COHO AT 15.0 PERCENT FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL POPULATIONS WITHIN THE ESU EFFECTIVELY LIMITING FISHERIES FOR OTHER SPECIES. NMFS, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNCIL, INDICATES STATES SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE INCREASES IN MONITORING INCLUDING EXPANSION OF SPAWNING GROUND SURVEYS TO AID THE COMANAGERS  ABILITY TO ASSESS IMPACTS TO WILD SONCC COHO SALMON, REDUCING SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY REFLECTED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT. ESTIMATING ANNUAL CHINOOK SALMON AND STEELHEAD TROUT ESCAPEMENT AND IDENTIFYING CRITICAL AREAS FOR JUVENILE REARING WILL AID IN DEFINING FUTURE SALMONID HABITAT RESTORATION PRIORITIES AND FISHERIES MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. FISHERIES ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS PRODUCED IN TECHNICAL REPORTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SPORT FISH RESTORATION ACT (SFRA) PROJECT ARE THE PRIMARY CATALYST FOR IDENTIFYING RESTORATION ACTIONS TARGETED AT INCREASING SPORTFISH POPULATION NUMBERS AND EVALUATING FISHERIES MANAGEMENT. AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ESTIMATE SPAWNING ESCAPEMENT IN LARGER RIVER SYSTEMS IS THROUGH THE USE OF SOUND NAVIGATION AND RANGING (SONAR) TECHNOLOGY. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE SPAWNING ESCAPEMENT OF ANADROMOUS SALMONID SPECIES IN THE SMITH RIVER BASIN USING SONAR, TWO KEY STUDY COMPONENTS ARE NEEDED. THE FIRST COMPONENT IS OPERATION OF THE SONAR UNIT TO ENUMERATE FISH AS THEY MIGRATE UPSTREAM. THE SECOND COMPONENT PARTITIONS THIS COUNT INTO UNIQUE SPECIES BY ESTIMATING THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF FISH USING AUXILIARY SAMPLING TECHNIQUES. THE JUVENILE SNORKEL SURVEYS WILL INVESTIGATE HOW POPULATIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED WITHIN THE BASIN. INFORMATION REGARDING THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF SALMONID SPECIES REARING WITHIN THE BASIN IS NECESSARY TO EVALUATE BOTH IN-RIVER FISHERIES ASSOCIATED WITH CDFW HERITAGE TROUT WATERS AND TRENDS IN SALMONID SPECIES DISTRIBUTION AND OCCUPANCY PATTERNS THROUGHOUT THE BASIN OVER TIME. THE SPAWNING GROUND SURVEY COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TARGETED AT EVALUATION OF CHINOOK SALMON, COHO SALMON AND STEELHEAD SUB-POPULATIONS IN MILL CREEK WITHIN THE SMITH RIVER. BECAUSE POPULATIONS OF COHO SALMON ARE SMALL RELATIVE TO CHINOOK SALMON AND STEELHEAD, SONAR COUNTS PARTITIONED TO SPECIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE IMPRECISE FOR COHO SALMON. MILL CREEK IS KNOWN TO SUPPORT THE MAJORITY OF SPAWNING COHO SALMON ADULTS IN THE SMITH RIVER. WE THEREFOR TAKE A MORE APPROPRIATE, SPAWNING GROUND SURVEY APPROACH TO MONITORING TRENDS FOR THIS STOCK IN THE MILL CREEK SUB-BASIN. ADDITIONALLY, COLLECTION OF SCALES FROM CHINOOK SALMON TAKEN DURING THIS EFFORT CAN BE USED TO ADD AGE STRUCTURE TO ESTIMATES OF ABUNDANCE DERIVED FROM THE SONAR COUNTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6dbfa9e4-2810-6eee-6996-251196fb1203-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F23AF01613_1448"}, {"internal_id": 161362648, "Award ID": "F23AF01603", "Award Amount": 141000.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-07-27", "CFDA Number": "15.605", "Description": "THIS PROJECT INCLUDES THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE OF UTAH S BOATING ACCESS PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCES OF RECREATIONAL BOATERS AND BOATING ANGLERS IN UTAH.

AMONG THE MANY AREAS OF GUIDANCE ARE: 1) PRIORITIZATION OF MANAGEMENT EFFORTS  2) MEETING STOCK SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES  3) MEETING ECOSYSTEM OBJECTIVES (INCLUDING MINIMIZING IMPACT TO HABITAT AND BYCATCH SPECIES FROM THE NORMAL PROMULGATION OF FISHERIES, 4) ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE  5) DATA COLLECTION TO ANALYZE TRENDS IN FISHERIES  AND 6) PROVIDING THE PUBLIC WITH RELEVANT SCIENTIFIC DATA SUMMARIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGEMENT. AS PART OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MLMA, CDFW COMPLETED A FISHERY PRIORITIZATION EXERCISE FOR STATE-MANAGED FINFISH SPECIES. THOSE FISHERIES WITH HIGHEST OVERALL VULNERABILITY ARE CONSIDERED THE HIGHEST CANDIDATES FOR FUTURE ATTENTION AND MANAGEMENT ACTION, USING A SCALED MANAGEMENT APPROACH. THIS APPROACH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS: ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION  MANAGEMENT STRATEGY EVALUATION (MSE)  DEVELOPMENT AND UPDATES OF ENHANCED STATUS REPORTS (ESR)  AND A COMBINATION OF AN ESR AND A SCALED MANAGEMENT APPROACH, WHICH MAY INCLUDE A FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLAN. THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING SIX FINFISH SPECIES FOR WHICH THE PROJECT HAS MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY TO FOCUS EFFORTS: BARRED SURFPERCH (AMPHISTICUS ARGENTEUS), REDTAIL SURFPERCH (A. RHODOTERUS), CALIFORNIA HALIBUT (HALIBUT) (PARALICHTHYS CALIFORNICUS), NIGHT SMELT (SPIRINCHUS STARKSI), SURF SMELT (HYPOMESUS PRETIOSUS), AND WHITE SEABASS (ATRACTOSCION NOBILIS).ESSENTIAL FISHERY INFORMATION (EFI) COLLECTED BY FISHERY SCIENTISTS IS NEEDED TO ASSESS AND MANAGE THESE IMPORTANT SPORT FISHERIES.

AS A RESULT, PRIOR TO THE START OF THE ME NH INSHORE TRAWL SURVEY IN 2000, A DEARTH OF INFORMATION EXISTED FROM AREAS SHALLOWER THAN 300 FT. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE A SCIENTIFICALLY DEFENSIBLE QUANTITATIVE TIME SERIES ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF BENTHIC MARINE RESOURCES IN NEARSHORE GULF OF MAINE WATERS ALONG MAINE AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. THESE INSHORE WATERS ARE SUBSTANTIAL IN AREA AND CONTAIN KEYS HABITATS FOR SPORT FISH SPECIES AND THEIR PREY. WITHOUT THIS SURVEY, INFORMATION ON SPECIES IN THESE WATERS WOULD BE NONEXISTENT.THE MAINE NEW HAMPSHIRE INSHORE BOTTOM TRAWL SURVEY CONSISTS OF TWO SURVEYS, ONE EACH IN SPRING AND FALL. TOTAL SURVEY AREA ( 4546 NM2) IS STRATIFIED BY DEPTH AND REGION. IT INCLUDES FOUR DEPTH STRATA  4 20 FATHOMS, 21 35 FATHOMS, 36  55 FATHOMS, AND 56  FATHOMS IN FIVE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. THE SHALLOWEST DEPTH WAS BASED ON PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY A 54 FOOT DRAGGER WHILE THE DEEPER BOUNDARY WAS SELECTED TO APPROXIMATELY FOLLOW THE TWELVE MILE BOUNDARY JURISDICTION OF ASMFC. EACH SURVEY TARGETS 120 STATIONS EACH SEASON AND EQUATES TO A SAMPLING DENSITY OF ABOUT 1 STATION   38 NM 2.A STANDARD TOW CONSISTS OF TOWING THE RESEARCH NET FOR TWENTY MINUTES AT 2.5 KNOTS IN AS STRAIGHT A LINE AS POSSIBLE. THE NET USED IN THIS SURVEY IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF MAINE SHRIMP TRAWL DESIGNED TO FISH EFFECTIVELY FOR A VARIETY OF BENTHIC SPECIES. AT EACH STATION, THE NET IS BROUGHT ON BOARD AND ALL FISH ARE IDENTIFIED AND SORTED BY SPECIES. COLLECTIVE WEIGHTS ARE TAKEN FOR ALL SPECIES. LENGTHS ARE TAKEN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL UNLESS THE SAMPLES FOR THAT SPECIES ARE SO LARGE THAT THEY CANNOT BE PROCESSED BEFORE THE NEXT TOW. FOR LARGE SAMPLES (E.G. HERRING) A REPRESENTATIVE SUB SAMPLE IS TAKEN OF AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED (100) INDIVIDUALS. SEX AND MATURITY STAGE OF INDIVIDUALS ARE DETERMINED FOR SELECTED GROUNDFISH SPECIES USING THE METHODS DESCRIBED IN BURNETT ET AL, (1989). A CTD PROFILER IS DEPLOYED TO COLLECT TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY DATA. AT THE END OF EACH SURVEY, CRUISE AND CATCH INFORMATION IS ENTERED DIRECTLY INTO THE DMR S ORACLE DATABASE (MARVIN), AND ARE CHECKED FOR ACCURACY BEFORE USE.THE RESULTS FROM THE FIRST TWENTY TWO YEARS OF THE INSHORE TRAWL SURVEY SHOW PATTERNS OF USE BY RECREATIONAL SPECIES SUCH AS AMERICAN SHAD, RAINBOW SMELT, MACKEREL, WINTER FLOUNDER, HADDOCK, ATLANTIC COD AND IMPORTANT PREY SPECIES FOR SPORTFISH IN AREAS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY THE NMFS SURVEY.

FISHERY MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANGLERS TO FISH FOR ANADROMOUS SPECIES IN CALIFORNIAS CENTRAL VALLEY IS DEPENDENT UPON BASE MONITORING ACTIVITIES THAT ASSESS BOTH THE RESOURCES SUPPORTING THE FISHERIES, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FISHERIES THEMSELVES. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (CDFW) MANAGERS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE INFORMATION GENERATED FROM MONITORING TO MAKE SOUND DECISIONS FOR SETTING SEASONS BY TIME AND PLACE, ESTABLISHING DAILY BAG AND POSSESSION LIMITS, IMPOSING GEAR RESTRICTIONS, AND MAKING OVERALL ALLOCATIONS OF FISHERY RESOURCES.  THE FISHERIES ARE DIVERSE. THEY INCLUDE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR PER YEAR FISHERIES ON NATIVE SPECIES SUCH AS CHINOOK SALMON, STEELHEAD RAINBOW TROUT, AND WHITE STURGEON. THE INTRODUCED STRIPED BASS FISHERY IS TYPICALLY THE LARGEST FISHERY IN TERMS OF TOTAL ANGLER EFFORT. THE FISHERIES SUPPORTED BY INTRODUCED SUNFISHES RANGE FROM CONSUMPTIVE PANFISH FISHERIES FOR SPECIES SUCH AS BLUEGILL, TO NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED LARGEMOUTH BASS TOURNAMENT FISHERIES. THERE ARE ALSO MORE LOCALIZED NICHE FISHERIES SUCH AS THAT FOR SACRAMENTO SPLITTAIL, A CALIFORNIA NATIVE SPECIES OF SPECIAL CONCERN. EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF THE FISHERIES REQUIRES ANGLER SURVEYS THAT ARE STATISTICALLY ROBUST BY BEING COMPREHENSIVE IN COVERAGE BOTH SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY. ANGLER SURVEYS YIELD ESSENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FISHERY PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF ANGLING EFFORT, CATCH, AND HARVEST, ALL ON A SPECIES-SPECIFIC BASIS. THIS INFORMATION IS USED TO ASSESS FISHERY TRENDS OVER TIME AND SPACE, BOTH WITHIN AND ACROSS FISHING SEASONS. IT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DESIGNING REGULATIONS THAT BALANCE UTILIZATION WITH CONSERVATION, INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF IN SEASON CLOSURES. MONITORING OF THESE FISHERIES HAS OCCURRED TO VARYING DEGREES AND USING VARIOUS APPROACHES OVER TIME. EARLY MONITORING FOCUSED ON COMMERCIAL FISHERIES IN THE BAY AND DELTA PORTIONS OF THE SYSTEM (CLARK 1929). MONITORING OF RIVER SPORT FISHERIES IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER SYSTEM DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL THE LATE 1940S WITH FOCUS ON THE UPPER BASIN FOLLOWING THE CONSTRUCTION OF SHASTA DAM (SMITH 1950). A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANGLER SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY THE CDFW DURING THE MID 1960S (VAN WOERT 1965, 1966, 1968), AND THEN AGAIN DURING THE LATE 1980S TOEARLY 1990S (WIXOM ET AL. 1995) AND LATE 1990S-EARLY 2000S (E.G. MURPHY ET AL. 1999; MASSA AND SHROYER 2003). THE CDFW RESUMED THE ANGLER SURVEY IN 2006 AS A SPORT FISH RESTORATION ACT (SFRA) FUNDED PROJECT (TITUS 2007) THAT CONTINUES TODAY AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY ANGLER SURVEY (TITUS ET AL. 2012). IN CALIFORNIA, AS THROUGHOUT THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, ANADROMOUS FISHERY RESOURCES ARE MANAGED IN PART THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BROADSCALE MARKING AND TAGGING PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS FACILITATE STOCK MANAGEMENT, ALLOW FOR SELECTIVE HARVEST, AND PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR ASSESSING VARIOUS ATTRIBUTES OF THE EXPLOITED RESOURCE, INCLUDING AGE AND GROWTH, FISHERY IMPACTS ON POPULATION STRUCTURE, AND HOMING FIDELITY RELATIVE TO MANAGEMENT OF GENETIC RESOURCES. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY, MARKING AND TAGGING PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSED ON HATCHERY PRODUCED CHINOOK SALMON AND STEELHEAD RAINBOW TROUT, AND INCLUDE THE CONSTANT FRACTIONAL MARKING PROGRAM IN WHICH 25% (8 MILLION) OF ANNUAL FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON HATCHERY PRODUCTION IS ADIPOSE FIN CLIPPED AND CODED WIRE TAGGED. CALIFORNIAS CODED WIRE TAG PROGRAM IS COORDINATED ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. MONITORING ADULT ABUNDANCE OF TARGET SPECIES IS ALSO AN ESSENTIAL FISHERY MANAGEMENT ELEMENT IN CENTRAL VALLEY RIVERS AND STREAMS. MAINTAINING A PULSE ON ABUNDANCE OF KEY SPECIES, SUCH AS CHINOOK SALMON AND STEELHEAD, IS NECESSARY FOR OPTIMIZING ANGLING OPPORTUNITIES AND FOR REGULATING HARVEST OF THESE SPECIES.

OVER THE YEARS, THE LEGISLATURE HAS AMENDED THE INTENT LANGUAGE OF THE PROGRAM. CURRENTLEGISLATION FOCUSES ON ADVANCING RESEARCH IN DETERMINING IF HATCHERY RELEASED FISH CAN ENHANCE IMPORTANTRECREATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL SPECIES THROUGH INCREASED PRODUCTION OF FISH AND INCREASED MONITORING OF FISHERIES TOASSESS THE HATCHERY CONTRIBUTION. THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATION IS TO ENHANCE POPULATIONS OF MARINE FINFISH SPECIESIMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR SPORT AND COMMERCIAL FISHING VALUE. WHITE SEABASS HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF THISRESEARCH SINCE 1990.THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (CDFW) ADMINISTERS THE OREHP, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A 10-MEMBER OCEANRESOURCES ENHANCEMENT ADVISORY PANEL (OREAP).

CDFW ALSO EMPLOYS A RESEARCH SCIENTIST (FISH PATHOLOGIST) TO INVESTIGATE AND MANAGEDISEASE ISSUES WITH THE OREHP.CDFW'S MAIN CONTRACTOR IS HUBBS-SEAWORLD RESEARCH INSTITUTE (HSWRI). HSWRI OWNS AND OPERATES THE MARINE FISHHATCHERY (LEON RAYMOND HUBBARD, JR., MARINE FISH HATCHERY). HSWRI HAS DEVELOPED THE CULTURE PROTOCOLS REQUIREDFOR THE PROGRAM AND ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES REQUIRED TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF HATCHERY-REARED FISH ON THE WILDFISHERY. THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE HATCHERY IS TO PROVIDE JUVENILE WHITE SEABASS TO GROWOUT FACILITIES OPERATEDBY VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS AND HSWRI.

MANY OF THESE SPECIES ARE SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANT SPORT FISHERIES, INCLUDING BARRED SAND BASS, CALIFORNIA HALIBUT, AND PACIFIC BARRACUDA. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE DECLINES AND MANAGE THESE FISHERIES SUSTAINABLY, ESSENTIAL FISHERY INFORMATION (EFI) IS NEEDED TO ASSESS THEIR POPULATIONS. EFI INCLUDES DATA ON AGE AND GROWTH, REPRODUCTION, AND OTHER LIFE HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR MANAGING A SUSTAINABLE FISHERY. THESE DATA FORM THE BASIS FOR STOCK ASSESSMENTS AND MODELS THAT PROVIDE BETTER INFORMATION ON THE HISTORY, CURRENT STATUS, AND FUTURE DIRECTION OF THESE IMPORTANT SPORT FISHERIES AND ENABLE THEIR BETTER MANAGEMENT.A MASTER PLAN PER THE MARINE LIFE MANAGEMENT ACT (MLMA SECTION 7050 FISH AND GAME CODE) WAS UPDATED AND IMPLEMENTED IN JUNE 2018 TO REFLECT NEW PRIORITIES AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR STATE MARINE FISHERIES. THE MLMA MASTER PLAN INCLUDES A FRAMEWORK FOR MLMA-BASED MANAGEMENT THAT USES A PRIORITIZATION APPROACH FOLLOWED BY THE APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT SCALING FOR THAT FISHERY. PRIORITIZATION INTEGRATES A PRODUCTIVITY AND SUSCEPTIBILITY ANALYSIS (PSA) THAT LOOKS AT RISKS TO STOCKS WITH AN ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT (ERA) THAT EVALUATES ECOLOGICAL RISKS. ONCE A PRIORITIZED LIST OF FISHERIES IS GENERATED, A SCALED MANAGEMENT STRATEGY APPROPRIATE TO THAT FISHERY IS APPLIED.

IT DIRECTS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (CDFW) TO DEVELOP A MASTER PLAN. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE MASTER PLAN IS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF FISH STOCKS AND FISHERIES USING THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. AMONG THE MANY AREAS OF GUIDANCE ARE: 1) PRIORITIZATION OF MANAGEMENT EFFORTS; 2) MEETING STOCK SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES; 3) MEETING ECOSYSTEM OBJECTIVES (INCLUDING MINIMIZING IMPACT TO HABITAT AND BYCATCH SPECIES FROM THE NORMAL PROMULGATION OF FISHERIES, 4) ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE; 5) DATA COLLECTION TO ANALYZE TRENDS IN FISHERIES; AND 6) PROVIDING THE PUBLIC WITH RELEVANT SCIENTIFIC DATA SUMMARIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGEMENT. AS PART OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MLMA, CDFW COMPLETED A FISHERY PRIORITIZATION EXERCISE FOR STATE-MANAGED FINFISH SPECIES.  THOSE FISHERIES WITH HIGHEST OVERALL VULNERABILITY ARE CONSIDERED THE HIGHEST CANDIDATES FOR FUTURE ATTENTION AND MANAGEMENT ACTION, USING A SCALED MANAGEMENT APPROACH. THIS APPROACH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS: ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION; MANAGEMENT STRATEGY EVALUATION (MSE); DEVELOPMENT AND UPDATES OF ENHANCED STATUS REPORTS (ESR); AND A COMBINATION OF AN ESR AND A SCALED MANAGEMENT APPROACH, WHICH MAY INCLUDE A FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLAN.   THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING SIX FINFISH SPECIES FOR WHICH THE PROJECT HAS MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY TO FOCUS EFFORTS: BARRED SURFPERCH (AMPHISTICUS ARGENTEUS), REDTAIL SURFPERCH (A RHODOTERUS), CALIFORNIA HALIBUT (HALIBUT) (PARALICHTHYS CALIFORNICUS), NIGHT SMELT (SPIRINCHUS STARKSI), SURF SMELT (HYPOMESUS PRETIOSUS), AND WHITE SEABASS (ATRACTOSCION NOBILIS).  ESSENTIAL FISHERY INFORMATION (EFI) COLLECTED BY FISHERY SCIENTISTS IS NEEDED TO ASSESS AND MANAGE THESE IMPORTANT SPORT FISHERIES. FISH AND GAME CODE SECTION 93 DEFINES EFI AS INFORMATION ABOUT FISH LIFE HISTORY AND HABITAT REQUIREMENTS; THE STATUS AND TRENDS OF FISH POPULATIONS, FISHING EFFORT, AND CATCH LEVELS; FISHERY EFFECTS ON AGE STRUCTURE AND ON OTHER MARINE LIVING RESOURCES AND USERS, AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY OF A FISH SPECIES OR TO TAKING IN THE FISHERY THAT IS NECESSARY TO PERMIT FISHERIES TO BE MANAGED ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS CODE. THE PRIMARY TYPES OF EFI COLLECTED OR DETERMINED BY OUR STATE FINFISH RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT (PROJECT) USING SFRA FUNDS ARE AGE AND GROWTH, REPRODUCTION, AND OTHER LIFE HISTORY PARAMETERS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR MANAGING A SUSTAINABLE FISHERY. CDFW ALSO COLLECTS FISHERY DEPENDENT DATA ON FISHING EFFORT AND CATCH LEVELS. A KEY COMPONENT OF THE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT MANDATED BY THE MLMA IS A PROCESS TO USE THE DATA COLLECTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEM IS RESPONDING TO MANAGEMENT. MSE IS THE GENERIC TERM USED FOR A CLASS OF ANALYSES THAT TEST POTENTIAL MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE TRADE-OFFS AND LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. IN MSE, THE ENTIRE FISHERY MANAGEMENT CYCLE IS SIMULATED OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD TO UNDERSTAND HOW EACH ASPECT OF THE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE IS LIKELY TO PERFORM IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM. MSE REPRESENTS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH STAKEHOLDERS, ACADEMICS, AND OTHER OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO ACCURATELY AND COMPREHENSIVELY CHARACTERIZE THE FISHERY AND ITS MANAGEMENT GOALS.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS FOR THE DECLINING PARTICIPATION IN ANGLING HAS NOT BEEN WELL INVESTIGATED. IN 1988, FLETCHER AND KING(1988) REPORTED THAT, IN GENERAL, CALIFORNIA ANGLERS STOPPED FISHING DUE TO A LACK OF FREE TIME. HOWEVER, THE 18-24-YEAR-OLD AGE SUBGROUP CITED A LOSS OF INTEREST AS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR NO LONGER FISHING. LOSS OF INTEREST MAY RELATE TO POOR ANGLER SATISFACTION, WHICH WAS MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY NOT CATCHING ENOUGH FISH. IN A LATER STUDY OF 14 CALIFORNIA RESERVOIRS STOCKED WITH SALMONIDS, 78% OF ANGLERS CONTACTED WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR OVERALL ANGLING EXPERIENCE, BUT APPROXIMATELY HALF OF ANGLERS CONTACTED WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH EITHER THE SIZE OR NUMBER OF FISH CAUGHT (LEE 2003). SATISFACTION METRICS DID NOT SHOW A STRONG TREND OVER TIME IN EITHER DIRECTION. HOWEVER, THE STAGNANT AND MEDIOCRE LEVELS OF SATISFACTION IN FISH SIZE AND CATCH RATE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RECENT DECLINE IN ANGLING PARTICIPATION.A MAJOR PROBLEM FACING RECREATIONAL FISHING MANAGERS IS PROVIDING SATISFACTORY FISHING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANGLERS. NOT CATCHING ENOUGH FISH IS OFTEN THE GREATEST DETRACTOR FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF FISHING. ONE FACTOR THAT CAN LIMIT THE ANGLER USE AND SATISFACTION IS THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF GAME FISH AVAILABLE TO ANGLERS. FISHERY METHODS AND TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING ANGLER CATCHES ARE NUMEROUS AND LEE (1993) DESCRIBED VARIOUS LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES COMMONLY USED IN CALIFORNIA.

ADDITIONALLY, THIS SEASON STRUCTURE PROVIDES DE FACTO PROTECTIONS TO BOTH FALL SPAWNING AND SPRING SPAWNING SPECIES OF TROUT (E.G., BROWN TROUT AND RAINBOW TROUT, RESPECTIVELY) IN THESE WATERS.

WITH THIS VARIATION IN FISHING REGULATIONS HAS EVOLVED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CONFUSION AND DISCOURAGEMENT AMONG THE ANGLING PUBLIC, SUCH THAT THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHERE THEY CAN AND CANNOT FISH, AND WHEN, HAS LIKELY BECOME A DETERRENT TO ENGAGING IN TROUT FISHING AT ALL.CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (CDFW) RECENTLY DEVELOPED A STATEWIDE SIMPLIFICATION OF INLAND SPORTFISHING REGULATIONS, WHICH ADDRESSES THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CURRENT REGULATIONS BY APPLYING A YEAR-ROUND OPEN SEASON TO TROUT WATERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE, GENERALLY WITH HARVEST ALLOWED DURING THE TRADITIONAL SUMMER TROUT SEASON, AND GEAR RESTRICTIONS AND ZERO HARVEST APPLIED DURING THE NEW WINTER FISHING SEASON.

TODAY, THE CALIFORNIA BLACK BASS FISHERY PRODUCES TROPHY-SIZE, STATE RECORD, AND WORLD RECORD LANDINGS; OF THE LARGEST 25 LARGEMOUTH BASS CAUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES, 21 WERE LANDED IN CALIFORNIA. THIS QUINTESSENTIAL SPORTFISH AND KEYSTONE PREDATOR CONTRIBUTE TO MANY IMPORTANT FISHERIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WHILE BLACK BASS POPULATIONS ARE NOW SELF-SUSTAINING, TROUT REQUIRE ONGOING STOCKING EFFORTS TO REPLENISH POPULATIONS IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE.SINCE 2014, 520 DIFFERENT WATERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WERE STOCKED WITH CATCHABLE-SIZE TROUT, AVERAGING 419 WATERS PER YEAR.

FOR CALIFORNIA'S LAKES AND RESERVOIRS, EXTENDED SUMMERS AND INCREASED TEMPERATURES ARE ALREADY CAUSING ECOLOGICAL ISSUES; FOR EXAMPLE, IN 'TWO-STORY' WATERS, THE UPPER STORY IS SUSTAINING WARMER WATER FOR LONGER PERIODS, CAUSING THE COOLER WATERS IN THE LOWER STORY TO SUFFER GREATER OXYGEN DEPLETION AND CREATE DETRIMENTAL CONDITIONS FOR THE COLD WATER FISHERIES. UNDERSTANDING THESE FISHERY DYNAMICS, ESPECIALLY FOR BIOLOGICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY VALUABLE SPECIES, IS IMPORTANT FOR THE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR RESOURCES IN THE FACE OF A CHANGING CLIMATE.CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY OF STOCKING FISH SPECIES IN LAKES AND RESERVOIRS TAKES ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE TWO-STORY WATERS TO INCREASE RECREATIONAL ANGLING OPPORTUNITIES.
