THESE CONDITIONS INCREASE MORTALITY, HOSPITALIZATIONS, AND HEALTHCARE COSTS WHILE DECREASING LIFE SPAN, QUALITY OF LIFE AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION. INDIVIDUALS FROM LOW-INCOME AND RACIALLY MARGINALIZED BACKGROUNDS OFTEN EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. \tALL TOO OFTEN, HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. FACTORS IN THE BUILT, POLICY-RELATED, AND ATTITUDINAL ENVIRONMENTS INTERACT TO CREATE OR EXACERBATE HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SCI. THESE FACTORS ARE FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY A LACK OF INTEGRATED EVIDENCE-BASED PROTOCOLS AND DECISION-MAKING TOOLS. IN PARTICULAR, WHILE PHYSIATRISTS AND OTHER REHABILITATION PROVIDERS MAY HAVE THE TRAINING AND EXPERTISE TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH SCI IN PREVENTING OR MANAGING SECONDARY OR CHRONIC CONDITIONS, MOST OTHER TYPES OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAVE NEITHER THE AWARENESS NOR THE TRAINING TO DO SO AND REQUIRE DECISION-MAKING TOOLS AND STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS TO INFORM THEIR CARE. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE OVERARCHING FOCUS OF THE MICHIGAN SPINAL CORD INJURY MODEL SYSTEMS (MI-SCIMS) CENTER IS TO ENHANCE THE CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH SCI THROUGH OUR RESEARCH, DISSEMINATION, AND COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES. THROUGH OUR SITE-SPECIFIC RESEARCH PROJECT, WE WILL DEVELOP AND TEST THE RELIABILITY, PREDICTIVE VALIDITY AND CLINICAL UTILITY OF AN SCI HOSPITALIZATION RISK INDEX, WHICH WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO USE INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) TO FACILITATE PROACTIVE CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING AND REFERRALS.

UTILIZING THE USDA?S 2020-2025 DIETARY GUIDELINE FOR AMERICANS, THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIET ETICS SCI NUTRITION PRACTICE GUIDELINES, AND THE CONSORTIUM FOR SPINAL CORD MEDICINE CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES, THIS STUDY PROPOSES TO DELIVER INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY TO INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC SCI. A DIETITIAN WITH SCI SPECIALIZATION WILL DELIVER TREATMENTS 1) VIDEOCONFERENCING SESSIONS (BIMONTHLY IPAD FACETIME CALLS) AND 2) BETWEEN SESSION SUPPORT AND MONITORING (ATE APP PHOTO-JOURNAL AND MESSAGING). THIS APPROACH PROVIDES AN ECOLOGICALLY VALID, INDIVIDUALIZED INTERVENTION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH STANDARD CLINICAL PRACTICE, WHILE MEETING THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH SCI BY PROVIDING ACCESSIBLE SPECIALIZED CARE. SSRP METHOD: THE SSRP WILL ENROLL 96 INDIVIDUALS TO A RANDOMIZED, WAITLIST CONTROL STUDY WITH THREE PRIMARY OUTCOME TIME POINTS (BASELINE, 3-MONTHS POST-BASELINE, AND 6-MONTHS POST-BASELINE). THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT GROUP WILL RECEIVE BIMONTHLY TELENUTRITION (TN) COUNSELING DURING THE FIRST 3 MONTHS FOLLOWED BY A 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. DELAYED TREATMENT GROUP WILL RECEIVE THE INTERVENTION DURING MONTHS 4-6. SPECIFIC AIM 1: PROSPECTIVELY EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF TN ON DIET QUALITY. SPECIFIC AIM 2: PROSPECTIVELY EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF TN ON PHYSIOLOGICAL RISK COMPONENTS OF CMD. SPECIFIC AIM 3: PROSPECTIVELY EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF TN ON BOWEL AND BLADDER FUNCTION AND SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THE INCIDENCE OF AUTONOMIC DYSREFLEXIA AND QUALITY OF LIFE. DELIVERABLE: SHARING RECIPES FOR HEALTHY EATING. MRP: THE NCSCIMS PROPOSES A STUDY OF SUCCESSFUL AGING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SCI. STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT: A DIVERSE ADVISORY BOARD THAT INCLUDES INDIVIDUALS WITH SCI AND SCI PHYSICIAN-SCIENTISTS WILL ENSURE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WHILE A ROBUST DISSEMINATION PLAN. INCLUDING PUBLICATIONS, PRESENTATIONS, OUR WEBSITE, AND THE NIDLRR MSKTC WILL ENSURE ACCESS TO RESULTS GENERATED BY NCSCIMS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State

PARTNERED AND SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO MANY PEOPLE\u2019S PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE AND MAINTAIN SUCH RELATIONSHIPS IS AN IMPORTANT QUALITY OF SOCIAL INCLUSION AND COMMUNITY LIVING. HOWEVER, CAPACITY TO SEXUAL CONSENT (CTSC) POLICIES AND PRACTICES POSE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO SUCH RELATIONSHIPS FOR MANY WOMEN WITH ID AS THEY ARE OFTEN USED TO ABRIDGE THEIR RIGHT TO SEXUALLY INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS. DESPITE GROWING OBJECTIONS TO THE WAYS IN WHICH THE SOCIO-SEXUAL OPPORTUNITIES OF WOMEN WITH ID ARE OBSTRUCTED, RELATIVELY MINIMAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF CTSC.

THE SECOND AIM IS TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE PARADIGM FOR SERVICES THAT SECURES THE INALIENABILITY OF THIS RIGHT, WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR VARIATION IN WOMEN\u2019S ABILITIES. TO PURSUE THESE AIMS, THIS PROJECT INVOLVES THREE CONCEPTUALLY-RELATED RESEARCH STUDIES, EACH USING A DIFFERENT ANALYTICAL METHOD TO EXAMINE ONE PARTICULAR QUALITY OF CTSC. STUDY 1 IS A CRITICAL CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS OF THE MISALIGNMENT OF CTSC POLICIES WITH THE RIGHT TO SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS FOR WOMEN WITH ID.

PEOPLE WITH IDD ARE NOT ONLY AT HIGHER RISK OF DEVELOPING CHRONIC CONDITIONS, BUT MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS (MCC), THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION, WHICH RESULTS IN UNMET COMPLEX HEALTHCARE NEEDS, AND INCREASED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. THE DISPARITIES IN MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH MCC COULD BE EVEN MORE CRITICAL FOR PEOPLE WITH IDD THAT BELONG TO RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS. PEOPLE WITH IDD FROM RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY BACKGROUNDS ARE MORE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING MCC, RECEIVE SUBSTANDARD CARE AS A RESULT OF WELL-DOCUMENTED INEQUITIES, FACE VARIOUS SOCIAL RISKS, AND LACK THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO NAVIGATE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

TO IMPROVE THE WALKING ABILITY OF CHILDREN WITH CP, RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS HAVE EXPLORED THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING ABNORMAL GAIT AND TESTED VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS TO CONTROL AND MANAGE THE SYMPTOMS DURING ABNORMAL GAIT. A TYPICAL ABNORMAL GAIT PATTERN IS EXCESSIVE TRUNK MOVEMENT DURING WALKING, WHICH IS CONSIDERED A COMPENSATORY STRATEGY FOR LOWER LIMB DEFICITS AND/OR IMPAIRED TRUNK CONTROL. CURRENT APPROACHES ARE SUBOPTIMAL IN IMPROVING TRUNK POSTURAL CONTROL DURING WALKING IN CHILDREN WITH CP BECAUSE THESE APPROACHES ARE LESS TASK-SPECIFIC FOR ENHANCING TRUNK MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING WALKING. THEREFORE, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO IMPROVE THE EFFICACY OF CURRENT INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE TRUNK POSTURAL CONTROL DURING WALKING IN CHILDREN WITH CP.

THE PROJECTS IN THIS RRTC ARE AMONG THE FIRST TO USE AND INTEGRATE QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL AND RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT) STUDIES TO EXAMINE THE IDENTIFICATION, EFFICACY, AND SCALABILITY OF EMPLOYER PRACTICES HYPOTHESIZED TO MEASURABLY INCREASE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR WORKPLACE CLIMATES OF INCLUSION, EMPLOYEE-EMPLOYER TRUST, AND POSITIVE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES, AMONG OTHER CORE OUTCOMES. THE RRTC ALSO PROPOSES A SCIENTIFICALLY RIGOROUS AND EXPANSIVE, YET FOCUSED, EXAMINATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES VIA AN INTERSECTIONALITY LENS, FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHO HAVE MULTIPLE MINORITY IDENTITIES ALONG RACE/ETHNICITY, GENDER IDENTITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AND AGE. THE FINDINGS WILL PROVIDE DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF DISABILITIES AND EMPLOYERS ACCESS TO NEW, PRACTICAL, AND EFFECTIVE KNOWLEDGE, AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION, TO EXPLORE INNOVATIVE PATHS TO EMPLOYMENT AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT, WITH MEASURABLE OUTCOMES ADDRESSED. THE RRTC HAS THREE INTEGRATED PRIMARY PROJECT STREAMS: (1) QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE ON BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE EMPLOYMENT LIFE CYCLE FROM COMMITTED MAJOR COMPANIES AND SMALLER BUSINESSES; (2) RCT EVIDENCE ON EFFECTS OF PRACTICES ON TRUST AND SELF-DISCLOSURE AMONG JOB APPLICANTS AND CURRENT EMPLOYEES, AND FROM INTERVENTIONS ON ACCOMMODATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LESS VISIBLE DISABILITIES (E.G., MENTAL HEALTH, COGNITIVE); AND (3) EFFECTS OF PRACTICES ON SMALLER EMPLOYERS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS.  THE PROJECTS INCLUDE STUDIES ON WAYS TO IMPROVE POST-COVID \u201cNEW NORM\u201d EMPLOYER PRACTICES TO AFFECT POSITIVELY THE EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE RESEARCH CONSTITUTES A MAJOR LEAP FORWARD IN ANALYSIS OF DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES. THE DATA WILL PROVIDE A ROBUST BASIS FOR UNDERSTANDING CAUSALITY UNDERLYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISABILITY PRACTICES AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. RRTC PRODUCTS WILL INCLUDE VIRTUAL AND IN-PERSON TRAININGS FOR BUSINESS LEADERS, VR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONALS, AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, WITH INFORMATION IN PRACTICE BRIEFS AND

ASSET - SENSORIMOTOR IMPAIRMENTS TYPICALLY PERSIST AFTER STROKE, DESPITE EXTENSIVE CLINICAL AND RESEARCH REHABILITATION EFFORTS TO PROMOTE RECOVERY THROUGH THERAPY. THESE IMPAIRMENTS CONTRIBUTE TO PERFORMANCE DEFICITS IN A VARIETY OF DAILY ACTIVITIES, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING SOCIAL INTERACTIONS, ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, AND SELF-CARE. THUS, STROKE REMAINS THE LEADING CAUSE OF MAJOR, LONG-TERM DISABILITY IN ADULTS IN THE U.S. IN LIGHT OF THIS SITUATION, EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE MEANS TO RESTORE FUNCTION SEEM WARRANTED. WITH RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE POTENTIAL FOR WEARABLE ASSISTIVE DEVICES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE PERFORMANCE DEFICITS HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY. THESE ASSISTIVE DEVICES (INTENDED TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE CHANGE IN FUNCTION WITHOUT NECESSARILY MODIFYING THE UNDERLYING IMPAIRMENT) HAVE THE POWER TO ALLOW USERS TO REGAIN CONTROL OF MOVEMENT OF THEIR ARMS AND LEGS AND TO SENSE THOSE MOTIONS EVEN WHEN THE NEURAL DAMAGE REMAINS. YET, CURRENT USE OF ASSISTIVE DEVICES TO ADDRESS FUNCTIONAL LOSS IS QUITE LIMITED, BEYOND THE PASSIVE CANES AND ORTHOSES THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR DECADES. REHABILITATION EFFORTS FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC SENSORIMOTOR DEFICITS AFTER STROKE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THERAPY RATHER THAN ASSISTANCE, PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY A HISTORY OF POOR ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY. THE PROPOSED REHABILITATION ENGINEERING RESEARCH CENTER (RERC), ASSISTING STROKE SURVIVORS WITH ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY (ASSET), WILL EXPLICITLY ADDRESS KEY CHALLENGES SLOWING UPTAKE OF ASSISTIVE DEVICES BY STROKE SURVIVORS. IN COMPARISON WITH THERAPEUTIC TECHNOLOGY, SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION OF ASSISTIVE DEVICES PRESENTS A UNIQUE SET OF ISSUES THAT WARRANT INDEPENDENT EXAMINATION. IN ADDITION TO COMMON CONCERNS FOR WEARABLE DEVICES SUCH AS MASS AND POWER SOURCES, THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSISTIVE DEVICES SHOULD INCLUDE FOSTERING A SYNERGISTIC CONNECTION BETWEEN THE USER AND THE DEVICE. THE SIX PROJECTS SUPPORTED BY THE ASSET CENTER WILL FOCUS ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HUMAN-MACHI NE SYNERGY: 1) TRAINING THE USER TO OPTIMIZE DEVICE ASSISTANCE; 2) DESIGNING THE DEVICE TO ADAPT TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS; 2) PROVIDING THE USER WITH AUGMENTED SENSORY FEEDBACK OF TASK PERFORMANCE; 4) FACILITATING MECHANICAL COUPLING AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE USER AND DEVICE; 5) IMPROVING WALKING BALANCE THROUGH REAL-TIME USER MONITORING; AND 6) ENHANCING CONTROL OF DISTAL LIMB ORIENTATION FOR IMPROVED TASK PERFORMANCE. STROKE SURVIVORS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WILL PARTICIPATE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND INSIGHT. THE SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON EDUCATION, DISSEMINATION AND TRAINING EFFORTS. THE CENTER WILL STRIVE TO INVOLVED ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THESE ENDEAVORS, INCLUDING STROKE SURVIVORS, CAREGIVERS, CARE PROVIDERS, AND RESEARCHERS. WHILE THE EFFORTS OF THE ASSET RERC WILL ADDRESS TECHNOLOGY FOR SPECIFIC LIMBS AND JOINTS, THE CENTER OUTCOMES WILL HAVE RELEVANCE FOR OTHER DEVICES AND BODY SEGMENTS, THEREBY WIDELY IMPACTING THE

THUS, THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES SHOULD BE SUSTAINED IN THE HOME ENVIRONMENT; HOWEVER, THE COMPLIANCE IN PERFORMING HOME EXERCISE IS LOW DUE TO POOR MOTIVATION, BOREDOM, AND FORGETFULNESS.

WE WILL ALSO INTERVIEW PARENTS AND CHILDREN WITH CP TO UNDERSTAND THEIR IMPRESSION OF USING TECHNOLOGY AT HOME TO SHAPE OUR INTERVENTION. THE EXPECTED OUTCOME IS THAT CHILDREN WITH CP RECEIVING \u201cTHRIVE\u201d WILL IMPROVE THEIR ARM FUNCTION MORE AND HAVE BETTER ENGAGEMENT THAN THOSE WHO RECEIVE VR ALONE IMMEDIATELY AFTER INTERVENTION AND AT FOLLOW-UP. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO HAVE THE \u201cTHRIVE\u201d SYSTEM BE THE OPTIMAL HOME EXERCISE PLATFORM AS IT CAN PROVIDE CHALLENGING BUT MOTIVATING EXERCISES TO IMPROVE CHILDREN\u2019S ARM FUNCTION WHILE ASSISTING PARENTS IN SUPERVISING THEIR CHILDREN WITH CP TO COMPLETE HOME EXERCISES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "fafdc950-0302-1107-c64c-74fb82b7ab42-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_90IFST0009_7577"}, {"internal_id": 151144802, "Award ID": "90IFST0008", "Award Amount": 399079.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-03", "CFDA Number": "93.433", "Description": "PARENTS TAKING ACTION EHEALTH ADAPTATION AND PILOT FOR LATINX, BLACK AND CHINESE FAMILIES OF YOUNG CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER - THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS COLLEGE OF MEDICINE HAS FORMED A PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS SERVING LATINX, BLACK, AND CHINSE FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WITH ASD AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO ADAPT AND PILOT TEST AN EMPIRICALLY-SUPPORTED PARENT TRAINING INTERVENTION INTO BITE-SIZED EHEALTH LEARNING MODULES.

IN THE CONTEXT OF SUCH DRAMATIC SOCIETAL AND POLICY CHANGES, IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR STATES TO BE ABLE TO USE THE BEST AVAILABLE DATA IN ORDER TO DESIGN THEIR SYSTEMS OF SERVICE AND SUPPORTS, AND FOR ADVOCATES TO HAVE ACCESS TO RIGOROUS YET UNDERSTANDABLE INFORMATION TO INFORM THEIR WORK TO DEMAND SUPPORTS FOR INCLUSIVE LIFE IN THE COMMUNITY. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT AIMS TO HELP STATE POLICYMAKERS AND ADVOCATES GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE DATA-INFORMED DECISIONS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH IDD IN THESE CHANGING TIMES. THIS RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE MERGER OF FOUR MAJOR DATASETS, EACH OF WHICH PROVIDES UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICAID UTILIZATION, A PERSON?S SUPPORT NEEDS, AND PERSONAL AND SYSTEM-LEVEL OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH IDD. MEDICAID IS THE SINGLE LARGEST FUNDER FOR SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR PEOPLE WITH IDD AND THE FIRST TWO DATA SOURCES WE WILL WORK WITH REPRESENT VIRGINIA?S MEDICAID SYSTEM: (A) MEDICAID HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES EXPENDITURE DATA, WHICH INCLUDES SERVICES THAT HELP PEOPLE WITH IDD LIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND (B) MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ACUTE MEDICAL ENCOUNTER DATA, WHICH SHOWS THE MEDICAL SERVICES A PERSON WITH IDD HAS USED, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO COVID-19. THE THIRD DATA SET IS THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS IN PERSON SURVEY (NCI-IPS), WHICH IS USED IN THE MAJORITY OF STATES TO ASSESS IDD SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS PERSONAL OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH IDD. FINALLY, THE FOURTH DATA SOURCE IS THE SUPPORTS INTENSITY SCALE, WHICH IS A STANDA RDIZED INSTRUMENT FOR ASSESSING THE SUPPORT NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH IDD ACROSS SEVERAL DISTINCT DOMAINS. WE WILL MERGE DATA FROM THESE FOUR SOURCES AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL FROM VIRGINIA FISCAL YEARS 2019, 20, AND 21, TO CREATE ONE OF THE COUNTRY?S MOST COMPREHENSIVE IDD-FOCUSED DATASETS.

PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PARTICIPATION DISPARITIES IN COMMUNITY LIVING (CL), COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION (CP) AND ECONOMIC EQUITY (EE). THESE DISPARITIES UNFOLD AT NATIONAL, STATE AND CITY LEVELS, DIRECTLY AFFECTING PARTICIPATION RIGHTS, CHOICE, AND CONTROL. STARK DISPARITIES HAVE BEEN FURTHER BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT WITH THE COVID PANDEMIC. PUBLIC HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH HAS APPLIED THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDH) FRAMEWORK TO EXAMINE HOW ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCE HEALTH DISPARITIES OF OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS, SUCH AS BY RACE, ETHNICITY, AND INCOME. RESEARCH THAT HAS INCLUDED DISABILITY HAS STUDIED IT AS A NEGATIVE OUTCOME, RATHER THAN EXAMINING WHETHER PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS A SOCIETAL GROUP HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND PARTICIPATION OPPORTUNITIES LIKE ANY OTHER SOCIETAL GROUP, THE LEVEL OF DISPARITIES THEY EXPERIENCE, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AT THE MICRO (IMMEDIATE), MESA (NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY) AND MACRO (POLICY, SYSTEMS, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIOCULTURAL) LEVELS AFFECT THOSE DISPARITIES OR AFFORD OPPORTUNITIES. THIS TYPE OF EQUITY RESEARCH EXAMINES TO WHAT EXTENT WHERE YOU LIVE, AND THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES YOU HAVE, IMPACT YOUR EVERYDAY PARTICIPATION, AND DIRECTLY INFORMS POLICY, SYSTEMS, AND COMMUNITY LEVEL ACTIONS SPECIFIC TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND TO THE ADA. ADA PARC WILL BUILD ON MANY YEARS OF PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH (PAR) DONE IN COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH A CONSORTIUM OF TEN 10 ADA CENTERS, THE ADA KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION (KT) CENTER, AND A NATIONAL NETWORK OF DISABILITY ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES. WE PROPOSE TO STRENGTHEN THIS CONSORTIUM, AND INCREASE ITS IMPACT ON COMMUNITY ACTIONS TARGETED AT ADDRESSING DISPARITIES, OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS BY COLLABORATING ON THE FOLLOWING PAR INITIATIVES: -\tEXAMINE EXISTING PARTICIPATION DISPARITIES USING LARGE POPULATION LEVEL DATASETS, COMPARING PEOPLE WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES, ON 53 INDICATORS OF PARTICIPATION (CL, CP, AND EE) TO DOCUMENT THE MOST CURRENT DISPARITIES FINDINGS, AND TRENDS OVER TIME; -\tANALYZE FINDINGS SPECIFIC TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND INTERSECTING IDENTITIES BY RACE, ETHNICITY, AGE, ECONOMIC STATUS, GENDER, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AND GENDER IDENTITY, TO DOCUMENT DISPARITIES OF DIVERSE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND COMMUNITIES; -\tANALYZE FINDINGS SPECIFIC TO THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM IMPACT OF COVID ON THE PARTICIPATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LIVING IN COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS; -\tVALIDATE AND SHARE PARTICIPATION EQUITY SCORECARDS THAT SUMMARIZE DISPARITIES ACROSS SDH INDICATORS, AND ALLOW STAKEHOLDERS TO COMPARE DISPARITIES AT STATE AND CITY LEVELS; -\tREVISE AND EXPAND THE EXISTING IMMEDIATE ACCESS, INTERACTIVE ADA PARC WEBSITE (ADAPARC.ORG) TO REPORT THESE FINDINGS IN MULTIPLE, ACCESSIBLE FORMATS FOR DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO UTILIZE IN ACTIONS, AND EVALUATE THE KT IMPACT WITH WEBSITE USERS; -\tCOLLABORATIVELY DESIGN AN ONLINE, PEER MENTORING INTERVENTION PROGRAM TO CREATE CITIZEN SCIENTISTS AND CHANGE AGENTS FROM DIVERSE DISABILITY GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES WHO WILL LEARN HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS DISPARITIES RESEARCH, AND USE ADA PARC FINDINGS TO ADVOCATE FOR SYSTEMS AND POLICY CHANGES AT NATIONAL, STATE AND COMMUNITY LEVELS. THIS INTERVENTION, REFERRED TO PEN (PARTICIPATION EQUITY NAVIGATORS), WILL BE EVALUATED IN A STUDY WITH 200 DIVERSE PARTICIPANTS WITH DISABILITIES TO DETERMINE ITS FEASIBILITY, ACCESSIBILITY,

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DISPARITY GAP EXPERIENCED BY THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED, BY DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ENABLE THE PRODUCTION OF LOW COST FULL- PAGE BRAILLE/TACTILE DISPLAYS. THE PATENT PENDING MAGNETIC BRAILLE CELL ACTUATOR (A TAXEL), DEVELOPED IN PHASE I, IS THE KEY TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL SET A NEW INDUSTRY STANDARD. THIS TECHNOLOGY UTILIZES A NOVEL ACTUATION AND LATCHING MECHANISM, ENABLING THE FABRICATION OF A VERY COMPACT, LOW POWER CONSUMPTION, HIGH PERFORMANCE TAXEL THAT COSTS FIVE TO TEN TIMES LESS THAN THE CURRENT BRAILLE CELL TECHNOLOGIES.THE FOCUS OF PHASE II IS A SYSTEMATIC STUDY TO DEVELOP THE COMPLETE ACTUATION MECHANISM (THE TAXEL UNIT). THE TAXEL UNIT IS THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT DRIVING THE COST AND PERFORMANCE OF ALL DIGITAL BRAILLE DISPLAYS. THE PERFECTED TAXEL UNITS WILL BE ARRAYED INTO THE PERFECT BUILDING BLOCK, THE UNIVERSAL TACTILE BUILDING BLOCK (?BLOCK), THAT CAN BE COMBINED TO BUILD DISPLAYS OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES. ALL COMPONENTS WILL BE FULLY OPTIMIZED FOR PERFORMANCE AND DESIGNED FOR EASE OF PRODUCTION.COMPLETE, TESTABLE PROTOTYPES OF THE TAXEL UNIT ?BLOCK WILL BE BUILT. EACH COMPONENT WILL UNDERGO TESTING FOR RELIABILITY AND LIFE CYCLE, AS WELL AS READABILITY. HIGHLY EFFICIENT ELECTRONIC CONTROL CIRCUITRY WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DRIVE THE DIGITAL TACTILE DISPLAY ? BRAILLE/UNIFORM TACTILE GRAPHICS/HYBRID (DISPLAY). A FABRICATION PLAN FOR THE TAXEL UNITS AND THE ?BLOCK WILL BE COMPLETED IN PREPARATION FOR PRODUCTION IN PHASE III. A SMALL MULTILINE BRAILLE DISPLAY WILL BE FABRICATED AND TESTED BY QUALIFIED BRAILLE READERS.PHASE III WILL TAKE THE PROVEN ?BLOCK TO FULL PRODUCTION. A VARIETY OF BRAILLE DISPLAY DEVICES INCLUDING, BRAILLE CALCULATORS, HAND-HELD BRAILLE DISPLAYS (TETHERED TO A SMART PHONE), MULTI-LINE AND FULL-PAGE BRAILLE/TACTILE GRAPHIC DISPLAYS, ETC., CAN BE MANUFACTURED BY ASSEM- BLING ?B LOCKS TO THE DESIRED DISPLAY SIZE. POLYMER BRAILLE, INC. (PBI) INTENDS TO RELEASE A SMALL DISPLAY EARLY IN PHASE III TO INTRODUCE THE DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY TO THE MARKET, FOLLOWED BY A MEDIUM SIZED DISPLAY AND THEN A FULL-PAGE DISPLAY BY THE END OF PHASE III.CURRENTLY, DIGITAL BRAILLE DEVICES ARE EXPENSIVE AND PROVIDE LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY. THERE ARE NO PAGINATED BRAILLE DISPLAYS THAT MEET THE NATIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE BLIND AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED STANDARDS FROM THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, AND ALSO HAVE VIABLE PERFORMANCE METRICS SUCH AS SPEED, ACCURACY, AND RELIABILITY. BRAILLE LITERATE INDIVIDUALS ARE FORCED TO READ DIGITAL CONTENT A SINGLE LINE AT A TIME; IMAGINE TRYING TO READ A SPREADSHEET USING A SIMPLE CALCULATOR AS THE DISPLAY. VISUALLY IMPAIRED INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE FUNDAMENTAL NEED AND RIGHT TO HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO ALL DIGITAL CONTENT. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES ALL THREE OF THE NIDILRR OUTCOME DOMAINS, BUT FOCUSES ON EMPLOYMENT. FULL-PAGE PAGINATED BRAILLE/TACTILE DISPLAYS WILL MAKE DIGITAL CONTENT ACCESSIBLE IN THE CLASSROOM AND IN THE WORKPLACE.BRAILLE LITERACY IS DECLINING IN PART BECAUSE IT IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS OFFERING PATH TO THE DIGITAL WORLD, BUT THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD SPARK A RENEWED INTEREST.
