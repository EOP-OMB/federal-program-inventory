RTI\u2019S PROPOSED TEAM HAS DEVOTED THEIR WORK OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS TO GLOBAL INITIATIVES THAT IMPROVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR PWID. OUR TEAM INCLUDES LEADING EXPERTS WHO ARE EMINENTLY QUALIFIED TO CARRY OUT THE PROPOSED WORK. OUR TEAM HAS IMPLEMENTED AND DISSEMINATED AN ANNUAL NATIONAL SURVEY OF SYRINGE SERVICE PROGRAMS (NSSSP), ACHIEVING ~80% RESPONSE RATES OVER THE LAST 2 ROUNDS. OUR TEAM EXCELS AT CONVENING AND COMMUNICATING TO SSPS FOR VIRTUAL AND IN-PERSON EVENTS. RESPONDING TO COMPONENT 1 OF CDC-RFA-PS22-2208, RTI WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THESE PARTNERSHIPS TO SUPPORT A NATIONAL SSP NETWORK. RTI\u2019S TEAM WILL CONDUCT UP TO 40 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS ANNUALLY TO IDENTIFY EMERGING COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES, EXPLORE NEW COMMUNICATION MECHANISMS, AND UNDERSTAND OTHER EMERGING ISSUES FACED BY SSPS. RTI\u2019S TEAM WILL OVERSEE IMPLEMENTATION AND USE OF AN ANNUAL NSSSP, LEVERAGING PROCEDURES THAT HAVE HELPED US ACHIEVE AN ~80% RESPONSE RATE IN PRIOR SURVEYS.

OUR APPROACH WILL YIELD ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF SSP SERVICES IN THE U.S. WE WILL SUPPORT AND STRENGTHEN COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES SUCH THAT THE DISSEMINATION OF SURVEY FINDINGS (AND OTHER EMERGING INFORMATION) REACHES A BROAD AUDIENCE AND OPTIMIZES SERVICE DELIVERY.
