WE SPECIFICALLY SEEK TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS AND CONDUCT AUTONOMOUS STUDIES USING GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR (GFR) AND ROBOTIC-MOUNTED ALBEDO SENSORS TO PROVIDE DATA THAT LINK TO FIRN COMPACTION AND SURFACE MASS BALANCE OFTHE GREENLAND ICE SHEET AND ASSOCIATED CLIMATE MODELS. AUTONOMOUS POSITIONING AND OPERATION OF GROUND INSTRUMENTS USING ROBOTS EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES FORTERRESTRIAL SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY THROUGH REMOTE SENSING. ROBOTIC SURVEYS CAN PROVIDE HIGH-RESOLUTION SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA TO IMPROVE ICE SHEET MASS-BALANCE MODELS  PROVIDE GROUND TRUTH FOR AERIAL AND SATELLITE DATA  AND MORE BROADLY PROVIDE PARADIGMS FOR EXTRAPLANETARY GROUND-BASED SCIENCE. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE VALUE OF AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS THROUGH ANTARCTIC AND GREENLAND FIELD DEPLOYMENTS TOTALING OVER 1000 KM OF AUTONOMOUS OPERATION. THROUGH THESE DEPLOYMENTS  WE HAVE GATHERED DATA VIA GFS-GUIDED GRID SURVEYS CONDUCTED WITH DARTMOUTH'S TWO POLAR ROBOTS - YETI AND COOL ROBOT - TOWING INSTRUMENTS. DARTMOUTH HAS COLLABORATED WITH SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITIES OFMAINE AND NEW HAMPSHIRE  AND THE U.S. ARMY COLD REGIONS RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING LABORATORY (CRREL) ON THESE PROJECTS. THIS COLLABORATIVE NASA EPSCOR PROJECT BETWEEN DARTMOUTH COLLEGE  UNIV. OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  CRREL  AND NASA GODDARD SCIENTISTS NOW EXTENDS THE SCIENCE IMPACT OF AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS AS ROVING SCIENCE PLATFORMS AND DEVELOPS NEW CAPABILITIES WITHIN NEW HAMPSHIRE TO COMPETE FOR NON-EPSCOR FUNDING. WE PROPOSE ROBOTIC OPERATION OF INSTRUMENTS TO SUPPORT SCIENCE OBJECTIVES DESCRIBED ABOVE: 1) REPETITIVE GPR SURVEYS OF A SPECIFIED REGION OVER A FULL SUMMER SEASON IN THE VICINITY OF SUMMIT CAMP  GREENLANDTO PROVIDE ACCUMULATION DATA AND MEASURE FIRN COMPACTION RATES IN A DRY-SNOW ZONE AND TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES FOR ROBOTIC ACQUISITION OF SUCH DATA; AND 2) DEVELOPMENT OF INSTRUMENTATION  INFRASTRUCTURE  AND MEASUREMENT PROTOCOLS TO MAP ALBEDO  SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA  AND SNOW TEMPERATURE USING ROBOT-TOWED INSTRUMENTS. THESE OBJECFIVES REQUIRE A NEW ROBOTIC CAPABILITY TO MEASURE AND RESPOND AUTONOMOUSLY TO THE DATA COLLECTED IN ORDER TO ADJUST ROBOT TRAJECTORY ON-THE-FLY. THIS CAPABILITY WILL ENABLE CLOSED-LOOP MAPPING OF SNOW AND FIRN CHARACTERISTICS AND THUS WILL ENABLE EFFICIENT USE OF FIELD TIME AND LIMITED ENERGY RESOURCES COMPARED WITH BROADER GRID SURVEYS. DARTMOUTH'S POLAR ROBOTS WILL BE USED FOR THESE TASKS. ON-BOARD DATA PROCESSING AND RESPONSE ALGORITHMS TO BE DEVELOPED IN THISPROJECT WILL ALLOW THE ROBOTS TO POSITION SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS DYNAMICALLY BASED ON PRELIMINARY DATA OR TO RESPOND TO SPECIFIC EVENTS OR MEASUREMENTS. DATA FROM THESE AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC SURVEYS PROVIDE MEASUREMENTS FOR IDENTIFYING PARAMETERS AS INPUTS TO NUMERICAL MODELS OF MASS BALANCE  ACCUMULATION AND ABLATION  AND ALSO CAN PROVIDE GROUND TRUTH FOR NASA ICEBRIDGE MEASUREMENTSAND MODIS RADIOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH BUILDS INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY FOR DARTMOUTH COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE STUDENTS IN POLARSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING THAT IS LINKED TO NASA'S REMOTE SENSING PRODUCTS AND FOR EXTENDING COLLABORATIONS TO INCLUDE SCIENTISTS IN OTHER STATES. DARTMOUTH WAS RECENTLY AWARDED AN NSF GRANT FOR THE JOINT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PROGRAM (JSEP)  A FEDERAL EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM BETWEEN THE U.S.  GREENLAND  AND DENMARK THAT INSPIRES HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THROUGH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING BY TRAVELING TO GREENLAND TO EXPLORE INTERNATIONAL POLAR RESEARCH.

"Description": "AIR TRAFFIC DEMAND IN THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEMS (NAS) HAS BEEN FORECAST TO DOUBLE BY THE YEAR 2025.  UNFORTUNATELY  THE PRESENT AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) SYSTEM IS ALREADY STRAINED AND CANNOT SCALE TO MEET THIS DEMAND. MOREOVER  WITH THE ADVENT OF UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS SHARING NAS  THE SITUATION MAY DETERIORATE EVEN MORE RAPIDLY. TO RESTRUCTURE THE ATC SYSTEM  NASA IS COOPERATINGWITH THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO DEVELOP NEXTGEN  DESIGNED TO GREATLY INCREASE THE NAS CAPACITY  EFFICIENCY  SAFETY  FLEXIBILITY  AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. HOWEVER  WHAT IS NEEDED IS A TRANSFORMATION FROM ATC TO AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT (ATM)  ALLOWING AIRCRAFT MORE AUTONOMY. DEVELOPING MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THAT TRANSFORMATIONAL SYSTEM IS THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT  WHICH IS COORDINATED BY SCIENCE PI X. RONG LI  UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS. THE TEAM INVOLVES RESEARCHERS AT LSU AND SU AS WELL AS SUPPORT FROM AMES  LARC  SIX BUSINESS/INDUSTRY CONCERNS PLUS THE U.S. AIR FORCEAND THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. AN ATM SYSTEM IS CENTERED ON TRAJECTORY-BASED OPERATIONS  WHICH RELY CRITICALLY ON RELIABLE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION PROCESSING AND NETWORK-CENTRIC MANAGEMENT. THIS INCLUDES 4D TRAJECTORY PREDICTION (TP)  INTENT INFERENCE AND VERIFICATION (IIV)  CONFLICT DETECTION AND RESOLUTION (CDR)  SEPARATION ASSURANCE (SA)  CONFORMANCE MONITORING (CM)  AND AIRCRAFT HEALTH MANAGEMENT. EACH OF THESE REPRESENTS A SEPARATE OPERATIONAL PROBLEM FOR WHICH WE PROPOSE INNOVATIVE AND SOLID FORMULATIONS OF THE PROBLEM  SYSTEMATIC AND PROMISING SOLUTION APPROACHES  AND WELL-THOUGHT-OUT RESEARCH TASKS. FOR EXAMPLE  ACCURATE AND RELIABLE LONG-TERM TP AND IIV CAN ONLY COME HAND IN HAND  SINCE THEY INVOLVE AIRCRAFT INTENT  WEATHER CONDITIONS  NAVIGATION ACCURACY  ETC. OURAPPROACH IS BASED ON JOINT DECISION AND ESTIMATION  A FRAMEWORK WE DEVELOPED RECENTLY  ALONG WITH ITS OPTIMAL SOLUTION. SIMILARLY  OUR PROPOSED STATISTICAL CDR REPRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH OFFERING CONFLICT ALERTS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS BASED ON A DIRECT STATISTICAL HYPOTHESISTESTING FORMULATION  WHICH WILL BE MORE CONVENIENT TO USE THAN MOST EXISTING MODELS.

HOWEVER  THE STANDBY POWER OF CURRENT SENSORS IS NOT IDEAL. MOTION SENSORS OR LIGHT SENSORS IN A CONVENTIONAL LED BULB CONSUME 0.1W TO 1W IN STANDBY. ELECTRONIC SWITCHES AND SENSORS WITH ZERO-STANDBY POWER ARE IDEAL FOR THE DETECTION OF INFREQUENT BUT TIME-CRITICAL EVENTS SUCH AS FIRE  PROJECTILES  EXPLOSIVES  EARTHQUAKES  AND RECONFIGURABLE RF PHOTONICS CIRCUITS. THEY ARE PARTICULARLY SUITABLE FOR LONG-STANDBY-TIME MISSIONS  SUCH AS PLANETARY EXPLORATION AND SPACE SENSING. SENSORS WITH ZERO-STANDBY POWER AND LOW OPERATION POWER CONSUMPTION WILL BE THE IDEAL LOADS FOR BOTH LASER SAIL AND SOLAR SAIL WHICH HAVE SUPERIORITY OF SPEED BUT CARRY SMALL LOADS. MEANWHILE  PHOTONIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (PICS) DEMONSTRATE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR NEXT GENERATION SPACE APPLICATIONS ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELDS OF COMMUNICATIONS  SIGNAL PROCESSING  AND SENSING. HOWEVER  MANY COMPONENTS OF PICS  SUCH AS OPTICAL AMPLIFIERS  MODULATORS  AND SWITCHES  CONSUME MUCH HIGHER POWER THAN THEIR ELECTRONIC COUNTERPARTS. RECONFIGURABLE PICS OPERATING AT LOW OPERATION POWER ARE IN HEAVY DEMAND. IN THIS PROJECT  PIS WILL COMBINE THEIR COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE TO DEMONSTRATE MULTIFUNCTIONAL ZERO-STANDBY POWER SENSING AND RECONFIGURABLE PHOTONIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS  PROVIDING EXTREMELY LOW POWER SOLUTIONS FOR NASA MISSIONS: O1: DEVELOP SCALABLE NEAR ZERO-STANDBY POWER SWITCHES. THESE SWITCHES CAN SERVE AS EVENT-DRIVEN POWER SWITCHES FOR ELECTRO-OPTICAL SENSORS  COMMUNICATION UNITS  AND EVEN THE MAIN SWITCH OF A WHOLE SPACE PROBE SYSTEM IN A DEEP-SPACE EXPLORATION MISSION. O2: DEVELOP A VERSATILE RECONFIGURABLE PHOTONIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS SENSOR SYSTEM WITH NEAR ZERO-STANDBY POWER AND LOW-OPERATION POWER. BY INCORPORATING NEAR ZERO-STANDBY POWER SWITCHES FOR SENSORS AWAKEN AND RECONFIGURABLE COMPONENTS FOR FAST AND FREQUENT SIGNAL PROCESSING  THE PROPOSED PICS SENSOR SYSTEM SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES POWER CONSUMPTION FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING AND FOR OPTICAL-TOELECTRICAL CONVERSION BY UNITS SUCH AS DETECTORS AND OPTICAL AMPLIFIERS. THIS PROPOSED WORK WILL ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART LOW POWER TECHNOLOGY IN OPTOELECTRONIC SWITCHES AND RECONFIGURABLE PICS. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS WORK WILL LEAD TO SCALABLE NEAR ZERO-STANDBY POWER SWITCHES WHICH MAY BE USED IN SCENERIES FROM SINGLE WAVEGUIDE  SINGLE DEVICES  TO CHIPS AND EVEN A WHOLE SPACE PROBE SYSTEM. BY COMBINING THESE SWITCHES AND OTHER RECONFIGURABLE COMPONENTS  PICS CONSUMING VERY LOW POWER WILL BE ACHIEVED AND FIT IN ULTRACOMPACT SYSTEMS SUCH AS A SPACE PROBE DRIVEN BY LASER SAIL OR SOLAR SAIL. THROUGH OUR PROPOSED EFFORTS  WE EXPECT TO BRING THIS TECHNOLOGY FROM TRL1 TO TRL4. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS WORK WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DELAWARE STATE RESEARCH CAPABILITY IN THE AREA OF INTEGRATED PHOTONICS AND SENSORS TECHNOLOGY. IT ATTRACTS STUDENTS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING  ENHANCING THE NASA MISSION STRENGTHENING STEM EDUCATION THROUGH INSPIRATIONAL MISSIONS AND COLLABORATION WITH THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY. IT WILL ALSO HELP TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH BELOW-MENTIONED RESEARCH CENTERS  PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE  SCIENCE  AND TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES OF DELAWARE STATE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DE", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "88f4772d-e0bd-42e6-ed20-c3144d3bace8-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80NSSC23M0076_8000"}, {"internal_id": 159306622, "Award ID": "80NSSC23M0075", "Award Amount": 749662.96, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-05-12", "CFDA Number": "43.008", "Description": "EFFICIENT AND HIGH QUALITY SPACE ROBOTIC VR TELEOPERATION THROUGH NEURAL SCENE AND OBJECT RECONSTRUCTION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "RI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "378fe7f9-e157-cd75-80cc-97cbe1a426db-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80NSSC23M0075_8000"}, {"internal_id": 159753556, "Award ID": "80NSSC23M0074", "Award Amount": 750000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-05-18", "CFDA Number": "43.008", "Description": "THE NASA KENTUCKY EPSCOR PROGRAM S MISSION IS TO ENHANCE THE RESEARCH AND INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY OF THE STATE'S UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES THROUGH STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NASA-PRIORITY RESEARCH AREAS AND TO INCREASE RESEARCHER COMPETITIVENESS FOR NON-EPSCOR NASA FUNDING.

UNDERSTANDING AND BEING ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT MATERIALS SURFACE EROSION AND FAILURE DUE TO HIGH-VELOCITY PARTICLE IMPACT IS RELEVANT FOR NASA CURRENT AND FUTURE MISSIONS. IN THE CASE OF PLANETARY ENTRY APPLICATION  THE THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM (TPS) MATERIALS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO IMPACT BY HYPERVELOCITY PARTICLES SUCH AS DUST PARTICLES SUSPENDED IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE DURING MARS LANDING AND SAMPLE RETURN. ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF SURFACE EROSION IS NECESSARY TO AVOID OVER-DESIGN OF THE TPS. IN THE CASE OF SPACEFLIGHT APPLICATION  SPACECRAFT ARE SUBJECT TO MICRO-METEOROID AND ORBITAL DEBRIS (MMOD) IMPACT DAMAGE WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DEGRADE PERFORMANCE  SHORTEN THE MISSION  OR RESULT IN CATASTROPHIC LOSS OF THE VEHICLE. MATERIAL SURFACE EROSION DUE TO HIGH-VELOCITY IMPACT IS ALSO RELEVANT TO THE AEROSPACE PROPULSION ENGINE APPLICATIONS. WHEN OPERATING IN DUST-LADEN ENVIRONMENTS  ENGINE COMPONENTS ARE IMPACTED BY SOLID EROSIVE PARTICLES ENTRAINED IN THE GAS FLOW  WHICH RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL REMOVAL THAT CAN LEAD TO DELETERIOUS EFFECTS IN ENGINE PERFORMANCE. ALL THESE MUST BE CAREFULLY STUDIED TO SUPPORT NASA MISSIONS. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS INVESTIGATION OF MATERIALS SURFACE EROSION AND FAILURE DUE TO HIGH-VELOCITY PARTICLE IMPACT RELATED TO NASA APPLICATIONS INCLUDING TPS  SPACEFLIGHT AND NEXT-GENERATION AEROSPACE PROPULSION ENGINE APPLICATIONS.

STRENGTHS. IT USES THE MULTIROTOR VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING CAPABILITY AND FIXED-WING EFFICIENCY FOR NAVIGATION AND CRUISE FLIGHT. THIS WILL RESULT IN A COST-EFFECTIVE UAS  WITH A REDUCED DEPLOYMENT TIME OF 5 MINUTES  AND AN ENHANCED FLIGHT DURATION OF 1 HOUR  AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY. THE MAIN APPLICATION ENVISIONED WITH THE QUADPLANE IS TO USE IT IN SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS THAT WILL AID FIRST RESPONDERS IN RAPIDLY LOCATING MISSING INDIVIDUALS IN DENSE FORESTED AREAS. TO ENSURE QUICK DETECTION AND ACCURATE TARGET REGION LOCALIZATION  WE AIM TO CONDUCT THE SEARCH OPERATION IN TWO PHASES. IN THE FIRST PHASE  THE UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS (UAS) USES A FAST-CREEPING LINE SEARCH AND THERMAL CAMERA DETECTION TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY THE TARGET REGION OF THE MISSING INDIVIDUAL(S). ONCE THE TARGET ZONE IS IDENTIFIED  THE UAS USES A LOITER SURVEY PATTERN IN COMBINATION WITH IMAGE-BASED RECOGNITION TO PRECISELY LOCATE THE IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUAL(S). BECAUSE TREES BLOCK THE VIEW OF CONVENTIONAL CAMERAS  A THERMAL CAMERA WILL BE UTILIZED INSTEAD. EVEN WHEN USING A THERMAL CAMERA  THE HEAT REFLECTED BY BRANCHES AND TREE CROWNS APPEARS TO BE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HUMAN BODY. TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS IN THE CAPTURED THERMAL IMAGE  A MACHINE LEARNING OBJECT IDENTIFICATION MODEL WILL BE USED.

PLANT CULTIVATION IN BLSSS WILL REQUIRE A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF NUTRIENTS AND WILL RESULT IN THE PRODUCTION OF INEDIBLE PLANT WASTES THAT STILL CONTAIN VALUABLE NUTRIENTS AND CARBON THAT COULD BE REUSED  RECYCLED  OR UPCYCLED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. IN THIS FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT  APPENDIX EIII (SPACEFLIGHT-COMPATIBLE RECYCLING OF NON-EDIBLE BIOMASS  SPACE CROP PRODUCTION GAP 1.D.1.0.1)  NASA RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVES TO IMPROVE PROCESSES THAT CAN CONVERT PLANT WASTE (LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS  LCB)  INTO VALUE-ADDED MATERIALS AND RECYCLE RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF SELF-SUSTAINABILITY IN BLSSS. THE MICROBIAL CONVERSION OF LCB INTO VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS IS A NATURAL PROCESS SUITABLE FOR LONG-TERM HUMAN HABITATION IN SPACE AND A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE TO EXISTING PHYSICOCHEMICAL METHODS. TYPICALLY  LCB BIOCONVERSION IS PERFORMED USING PURE CULTURES OR COMMUNITIES OF EITHER FUNGI OR BACTERIA HOWEVER  THE USE OF MIXED MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES  PARTICULARLY FUNGAL-BACTERIAL CULTURES (E.G.  BIOFILMS)  HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY EXPLORED. IN NATURE  LCB DEGRADATION IS PERFORMED BY COMMUNITIES OF DIVERSE MICROBES THAT METABOLIZE LCB IN A SYNERGISTIC  DYNAMIC  AND TIME-DEPENDENT FASHION. IMPORTANTLY  MIXED CULTURES TYPICALLY DISPLAY IMPROVED ADAPTABILITY AND SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION COMPARED TO MONOCULTURES. THUS  WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MIXED MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES WILL BE MORE EFFICIENT AT UTILIZING AND CONVERTING LCB INTO USEFUL PRODUCTS. BASED ON OUR HYPOTHESIS AND EXPERIENCE ESTABLISHING MIXED FUNGAL-BACTERIAL BIOFILMS  WE ARE PROPOSING TO USE AND ENGINEER (THROUGH CULTURE CONDITIONS) MIXED CULTURES OF LCB-DEGRADING ORGANISMS (PHANEROCHAETE CHRYSOSPORIUM  PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS  TRAMETES VERSICOLOR  PSEUDOMONAS PUTIDA  BACILLUS SUBTILIS) TO IMPROVE LCB BIOCONVERSION TO FURTHER CLOSE THE PLANT/FOOD PRODUCTION LOOP IN BLSSS.

WE AIM TO DO THIS BY OPTIMIZING THE MICROBIAL GROWTH  INTERACTIONS  SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION  AND ENZYME PRODUCTION IN LCB-DEGRADING MIXED CULTURES TO PROMOTE MICROBIAL SYNERGISMS AND IMPROVE LCB BIOCONVERSION. THE SPECIFIC TASKS PROPOSED ARE: (1) ESTABLISHING LCB-DEGRADING MIXED CULTURES AND CHARACTERIZING THEIR POTENTIAL SYNERGISTIC INTERACTIONS (2) OPTIMIZING CULTURE CONDITIONS TO ESTABLISH MIXED CULTURES FOR LCB BIOCONVERSION AND (3) DEVELOPING BIOREACTOR DESIGNS THAT CAN PROVIDE THE REQUIRED GROWTH CONDITIONS TO MAINTAIN MIXED CULTURES AND ENHANCE LCB BIOCONVERSION. THE COMPLETION OF THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND REACTOR DESIGNS FOR CONVERTING LCB INTO VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS AND RECOVER & RECYCLE RESOURCES FROM LCB TO CLOSE THE PLANT/FOOD PRODUCTION LOOP IN BLSSS (ADDRESSES APPENDIX EIII)  WHILE DECREASING THE COSTS AND DEPENDENCY ON RESUPPLYING RESOURCES FROM EARTH.

HUMAN SPACE MISSIONS ARE EXTREMELY COSTLY. THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH EXPLORATION OF SPACE MISSIONS CAN BE CURTAILED BY REDUCING THE LAUNCH MASS. THIS IS POSSIBLE BY UTILIZING IN-SITU RESOURCES. MARTIAN REGOLITH IS COMPOSED OF IRON  MAGNESIUM  ALUMINUM  CALCIUM  POTASSIUM  SILICON  CHROMIUM  MANGANESE  SULFUR  PHOSPHORUS  AND SODIUM  AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE AN EXCELLENT IN-SITU SOURCE OF MINERALS AND NUTRIENTS TO SUPPORT HUMAN LIVES AND ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER  THESE ELEMENTS EXIST IN THE FORMS OF STABLE OXIDES AND/ OR COMPLEXES RATHER THAN THEIR ELEMENTAL FORM. THE PROCESSING OF OXIDES AND COMPLEXES TO RECOVER HIGH PURITY ELEMENTS IS ECONOMICALLY AND TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING. SEVERAL DESERT PLANTS  SUCH AS PALOVERDE  GROW ON ROCKS IN NEVADA WITH LIMITED WATER  SIMILAR TO THE CONDITIONS ON MARS. THIS MEANS THAT THESE PLANTS ARE ABLE TO EXTRACT NUTRIENTS AND MINERALS FROM DESERT ROCKS SUCH AS BASALT. THESE PLANTS SURVIVE BY EXTENDING THEIR ROOTS DEEP  UP TO A FEW METERS INTO BASALT FRACTURES. BEING LEGUMES  THEIR NITROGEN COMES FROM NITROGEN GAS FIXING BACTERIA LIVING SYMBIOTICALLY IN THEIR ROOT NODULES. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THESE PLANTS HAVE UNIQUE MECHANISMS FOR THE EXTRACTION OF PHOSPHORUS AND MINERALS. FOR EXAMPLE  THEY LIKELY RELEASE BIOMATERIALS FROM THEIR ROOTS (ACIDIC EXUDATES) FOR THE SOLUBILIZATION OF PHOSPHORUS AND MINERALS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DELIVER A SAFE AND ECONOMICAL APPROACH TO EXTRACT PHOSPHORUS AND MINERALS FROM MARS REGOLITH VIA BIOMIMICRY OF THE GROWTH OF PALOVERDE. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO: 1. INVESTIGATE PHOSPHORUS AND MINERAL EXTRACTION BIOMECHANISMS UTILIZED BY PALOVERDE TO GROW ON BASALT AND MARTIAN REGOLITH SIMULANT AND 2. CHARACTERIZE BIOMATERIALS AND THEIR SOURCES AND RHIZOSPHERE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES AND THEIR ROLES. WE EXPECT THAT THE IDENTIFIED BIOMECHANISMS CAN BE MIMICKED FOR THE EXTRACTIONS OF PHOSPHORUS AND MINERALS FROM MARTIAN REGOLITH. WE WILL CONDUCT A DETAILED INVESTIGATION ON THESE EXTRACTION BIOMECHANISMS IN A GREENHOUSE USING CRUSHED BASALT AND MARTIAN REGOLITH LIKE MATERIAL (MARS GLOBAL SIMULANTS) WITH NO NUTRIENT AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS. WE WILL MONITOR MINERALS AND PHOSPHORUS RELEASED BY BASALT AND THE SIMULANT AND UPTAKEN BY THE PLANT. THE INVESTIGATION WILL ELUCIDATE THE INVOLVEMENTS OF RHIZOSPHERE MICROORGANISMS AND PLANT EXUDATES IN PHOSPHORUS AND MINERAL DISSOLUTIONS THROUGH SEVERAL ADVANCED ANALYTICAL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY TECHNIQUES. FOR EXAMPLE  WE WILL EXAMINE THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY OF THE RHIZOBACTERIA USING HIGH THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING. WE WILL CHEMICALLY CHARACTERIZE THE PLANT EXUDATES BY FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY  NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY  AND CHROMATOGRAPHY AND MASS SPECTROMETRY. THE VISION OF THE PROJECT IS NOT TO GROW PALOVERDE ON MARS BUT TO CHARACTERIZE THE BIOMATERIALS AND BIOMECHANISMS WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY BE ADAPTED THROUGH BIOMIMICRY FOR THE EXTRACTION OF RESOURCES FROM MARTIAN REGOLITH AND/OR ADOPTED THROUGH GENETIC ENGINEERING FOR GROWING OTHER PLANTS ON MARS. OUR INVESTIGATOR TEAM  WHICH CONSISTS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF QUALIFIED ENGINEER AND SCIENTIST  WILL COLLABORATE WITH A WELL-RESPECTED NASA PLANETARY SCIENTIST WITH EXPERTISE ASTROBIOLOGY AND TERRAFORMING.

THE PROPOSED CONCEPT IS A FLEXIBLE CONDUCTIVE COMPOSITE FEEDSTOCK MATERIAL BASED ON HIGH-TEMPERATURE THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITE LAMINATE WITH INTEGRATED CARBON NANOTUBE (CNT) FILMS. THE HIGHLY CONDUCTIVE CNT FILMS ACT AS IN-SITU HEATERS FOR ENERGY-EFFICIENT THERMOFORMING OF THE COMPOSITE  REMOVING THE NEED FOR LARGE  CUSTOM-BUILT  AND ENERGY-INTENSIVE OVENS. COMBINED WITH A HIGH-TEMPERATURE THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITE  THE CNT FILMS CAN REFORM THE STRUCTURE INTO A DIFFERENT SHAPE AND ANNEAL THE STRUCTURE ON DEMAND. THIS CAPABILITY ALLOWS THE COMPOSITE STRUCTURE TO HAVE A TIGHTLY FOLDED  COMPLIANT CONFIGURATION FOR PACKAGING  AND AN EXPANDED  STIFF CONFIGURATION FOR OPERATION  WHICH LEADS TO A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT OF VOLUME EFFICIENCY WITHOUT SACRIFICING STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE AND SHAPE ACCURACY. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE SCALABILITY  PACKAGING EFFICIENCY  AND SHAPE ACCURACY OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURES BASED ON THE CONDUCTIVE COMPOSITE MATERIAL. THE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES ARE: (1) PRODUCTION OF CNT/THERMOPLASTIC FILMS AND CNT/THERMOPLASTIC/ CARBON-FABRIC PREPREGS WITH TAILORABLE CONDUCTIVITY VIA AN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING METHOD  (2) FABRICATION OF DEPLOYABLE BOOMS VIA INSITU THERMOFORMING AND REFORMING  (3) CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PACKAGING EFFICIENCY  STRUCTURAL STIFFNESS  AND SHAPE ACCURACY  AND (4) MODELING OF THE ELECTRO-THERMO-MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMPOSITE DURING MANUFACTURING.

MISSIONS TO THE MOON  HOWEVER  REQUIRE MORE CHALLENGING DYNAMICS WHERE THE SOLUTIONS CAN RUN COUNTER TO CLASSICAL CONIC ORBITS. TO CLOSE THIS GAP  WE PLAN TO CREATE INTERNET-ACCESSIBLE SELF-STUDY AND TEACHING RESOURCES FOR MISSION ANALYSIS WITHIN GRAVITATIONAL MULTI-BODY ENVIRONMENTS  SUCH AS THE CISLUNAR SPACE. THIS MATERIAL WILL INCLUDE AN EASY-TO USE MULTI-BODY INTERFACE AS WELL AS VISUAL DEMOS FOR STUDENTS TO BETTER GRASP THE COMPLEXITIES OF CISLUNAR SPACE. GRAVITATIONAL MULTIBODY DYNAMICS ORIGINATE FROM THE INTERACTION OF MULTIPLE GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS. FOR EXAMPLE  THE DEEP SPACE GATEWAY (DSG) MOTION IN LUNAR NEAR RECTILINEAR HALO ORBIT (NRHO) IS DRIVEN BY THE COMBINED GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF THE EARTH AND THE MOON. WHILE MULTIBODY DYNAMICS OFFER NEW DESIGN OPTIONS FOR THE ARTEMIS PROGRAM  THEY ARE ALSO WELL-KNOWN TO BE CHAOTIC AND TO DO NOT YIELD READY TO- USE FORMULAS. MISSION ANALYSIS WITHIN GRAVITATIONAL MULTI-BODY ENVIRONMENTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AND MORE COMPLEX THAN TRADITIONAL MISSION ANALYSIS USING CLASSIC CONIC THEORY. TO ENABLE A LARGER NUMBER OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATE IN ARTEMIS-RELATED PROJECTS  A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF MISSION ANALYSIS WITHIN GRAVITATIONAL MULTI-BODY ENVIRONMENTS IS REQUIRED. THIS PROPOSAL CREATES A STRONG SYNERGY WITH CURRENT ASGC EFFORT TO DESIGN  BUILD  AND FLY A CUBESAT WITH THE FIRST ARTEMIS MISSION. THE CURRENT AEGIS PROPOSAL IS TARGETING A DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT  WHICH IS A MULTI-BODY TRAJECTORY.

WATER IS A KEY ELEMENT OF FUTURE RESOURCE IN PLANETARY EXPLORATIONS. SIGNS OF WATER ICE HAVE BEEN DETECTED ON THE MOON BY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES. THEIR SOURCES MAY RESULT FROM IMPACTS OF ASTEROIDS AND COMETS  VOLCANISM  OR IMPLANTATION BY THE SOLAR WIND. CLASSICAL THEORIES DISCUSS THAT THE ACCUMULATION OF WATER ICE ON THE LUNAR SURFACE IS RELATED TO HEAT TRANSFER. WATER ICE PARTICLES IN THE SURFACE LAYER CAN BE SUBLIMATED (OR MELTED) BY VARIOUS PROCESSES SUCH AS IMPACT CRATERING AND SOLAR HEATING. THEN  THEY MAY BE TRANSPORTED AT LOW ATTITUDE BUT TRAPPED BY COLD SPOTS INCLUDING THE PSRS. HOWEVER  THIS EXPLANATION IS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE LUNAR SURFACE MATERIALS ARE MIXED BY IMPACTS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES. THE PRESENT PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE HOW MATERIAL MIXING AFFECTS THE THICKNESS OF A DUST/WATER ICE LAYER. THE CURRENT PROJECT WILL EXPLORE THE MIXING DEPTH OF A DUST/ WATER ICE LAYER ON THE FLOORS OF THREE CRATERS  AMUNDSEN  CABEUS B  AND LOVELACE. THE FIRST TWO CRATERS ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTH POLE REGION WHILE THE THIRD ONE IS IN THE NORTH POLE REGION. THUS  THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THESE CRATERS ALLOW US TO INFER THE CONTRAST OF THE WATER ICE DISTRIBUTION IN THE PSRS AT THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLES. WE WILL DIVIDE A PSR WITHIN EACH CRATER INTO TWO LOCATIONS. THE FIRST LOCATION IS A PSR REGION FAR FROM THE SUNLIT-SHADOW BOUNDARY (SSB)  OR AREA 1. THE SECOND REGION IS AT THE SSB  DEFINED AS AREA 2. WE CONSIDER THAT MIXING IN AREA 1 IS ONLY CONTROLLED BY IMPACT BOMBARDMENT  WHILE THAT IN AREA 2 IS INFLUENCED BY BOTH IMPACT CRATERING AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL  WE EMPLOY DATA ANALYSIS  STATISTICAL MODELING  AND EXPERIMENTS. FOLLOWING ARE THE PLANNED TASKS. TASK A WILL CONDUCT DATA ANALYSIS BY USING ARCHIVED DATA IN NASA/PDS FROM LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (LRO)S THE LYMAN-ALPHA MAPPING PROJECT (LAMP) INSTRUMENT AND ITS CAMERA SYSTEM (LROC). WE WILL USE DATA FROM THE LROC AND LAMP INSTRUMENTS ARCHIVED IN THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM. LROC IMAGES WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP THE CRATER PRODUCTION FUNCTION AND ANALYZE THE CRATER CONDITIONS. LAMP IMAGES WILL BE USED TO ANALYZE THE AMOUNT OF WATER ICE IN THE SPRS. TASK B WILL QUANTIFY THE IMPACT-DRIVEN MIXING DEPTH ON THE FLOOR OF THE TARGET CRATERS BY USING AN ESTABLISHED STATISTICAL MODEL. THIS MODEL WILL PROVIDE THE STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE IMPACT-DRIVEN MIXING DEPTH OF A DUST/WATER ICE LAYER IN AREAS 1 AND 2 FOR EACH CRATER  GIVEN THE CSFD FROM TASK A. IN THIS TASK  WE WILL ASSUME THAT THE CSFDS OF THE PSR AND THE SUN-LIT REGION ARE SIMILAR WITHIN A CRATER. TASK C WILL EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DUST/WATER ICE TRANSPORTED AT THE SSB. EXPERIMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED IN THE MAGNETIZED PLASMA RESEARCH LABORATORY (MPRL) IN THE AUBURN UNIVERSITY PHYSICS DEPARTMENT. TASK D WILL INTEGRATE ALL THE RESULTS IN THESE TASKS TO GIVE CONSTRAINTS ON THE EFFECT OF MATERIAL MIXING ON THE THICKNESS OF A DUST/WATER ICE LAYER IN THE PSRS.

ONE OF THE MAJOR TECHNICAL CHALLENGES SPECIFIED IN THE 2015 NASA TECHNOLOGY ROADMAPS IS DEVELOPING HIGH-SPECIFIC-CAPACITY ANODE NANOMATERIALS WITH IMPROVED LOW-TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE (-60  C) FOR LITHIUM-ION (LI-ION) BATTERIES. THE RESEARCH GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IMPROVE THE POWER DENSITY  ENERGY DENSITY  AND CYCLE LIFE OF ANODES FOR LI-ION BATTERIES AT  60  C WITH A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTROLLING MECHANISMS. STUDIES HAVE REVEALED THAT THE POOR LOW-TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE OF LI-ION ANODES MAINLY RELATES TO SLOW IONIC DIFFUSION AND LIMITED LI STORAGE CAPACITY. THEREFORE  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON GROUP-IV ELEMENTS AND (TRANSITION/BINARY) METAL OXIDES OWING TO THEIR HIGH THEORETICAL SPECIFIC CAPACITY OF LI. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MAKING USE OF MATERIAL DOPING AND SIMULTANEOUSLY THE HIGH SPECIFIC CAPACITY CAN ADVANCE LITHIATION KINETICS  IONIC DIFFUSION  AND CAPACITY RETENTION IN ANODES AT LOW TEMPERATURES. TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL COMPLETE FOUR TIGHTLY COUPLED THRUSTS BY SYNERGISTICALLY INTEGRATING COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES. THE FOUR THRUSTS ARE (1) IDENTIFICATION OF HIGH-CAPACITY ANODE MATERIALS AND CORRESPONDING DOPING ELEMENTS THAT IMPROVE POWER DENSITY AT  60  C; (2) PREDICTION OF CAPACITY RETENTION AND CYCLING STABILITY IN DOPED HIGH-CAPACITY ANODES WITH THE CONSIDERATION OF CHEMO-MECHANICS; (3) ELECTROCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DOPED ANODES AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BATTERY PERFORMANCE AT -60  C; (4) DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF LI DENDRITES AND POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS METAL CLUSTERS IN CYCLED CELLS FOR MITIGATION OF SHORT CIRCUITS. THE RESEARCH OUTCOMES WILL ADDRESS KEY SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS: WHAT ARE THE CONTROLLING MECHANISMS FOR THE CHARGE-TRANSFER KINETICS  LI DIFFUSION  AND ELECTROCHEMICAL DEGRADATION IN DOPED HIGH-SPECIFIC-CAPACITY ANODE NANOMATERIALS AT -60  C? AND HOW CAN DOPING IMPURITIES ENHANCE THE RATE PERFORMANCE AND CAPACITY RETENTION OF THESE HIGH-SPECIFIC-CAPACITY ANODES SIMULTANEOUSLY?

A SPACECRAFT COMMAND AND DATA HANDLING SYSTEM PROCESSES ALL THE DATA SENT AND RECEIVED BY THE SPACECRAFT  INCLUDING OPERATIONS AND SCIENCE DATA. THE SYSTEM IS CONNECTED TO RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER UNITS THAT ARE THE SOLE POINT OF PASSAGE FOR DATA ENTERING OR LEAVING THE SPACECRAFT. THE BANDWIDTH OF THE CURRENT TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER IN THE SPACECRAFT LIMITS THE MAXIMUM DATA-TRANSFER RATE. TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE  ROBUST  COST EFFECTIVE  AND EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER DATA RATE SPACE COMMUNICATIONS  THE TECHNOLOGIES FOR HIGH-SPEED RELIABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES NEED TO BE ADVANCED TO MAINTAIN A SCALABLE INTEGRATED MISSION SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE 1998 AND WIDELY USED FOR HIGH SPEED RF COMMUNICATION CIRCUITS. THE PARASITIC COMPONENTS ARE ELIMINATED DUE TO THE NON-CONDUCTING SUBSTRATE. LESS HEAT WILL BE GENERATED DURING THE FAST OPERATING OF DEVICES. USING THE SOI TECHNOLOGY  A LOWER PARASITIC CAPACITANCE OF DEVICES ENABLES A FASTER SWITCHING FREQUENCY AND LESS POWER CONSUMPTION OF CIRCUITS. THE FABRICATION PROCESS IS ALSO SIMPLIFIED WITH LESS NUMBER OF MASKS TO DEFINE WELLS AND TRENCHES  ETC. ANOTHER KEY ADVANTAGE FOR SOI TECHNOLOGY IS THE RADIATION HARDNESS. THE SOFT ERROR RATES (SER)  WHICH IS THE PERCENTAGES OF DATA CORRUPTION DUE TO COSMIC RAYS AND RADIOACTIVE SIGNALS  CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED WITH THE USE OF THE INSULATING SUBSTRATE. AS ONE OF THE FIRST SOI PROCESSES  SILICON-ON-SAPPHIRE (SOS) PROCESS IS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOR THE FABRICATIONS OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ON SYNTHETIC SAPPHIRE. SAPPHIRE WAS CHOSEN AS AN INSULATING SUBSTRATE DUE TO ITS HIGH DIELECTRIC CONSTANT  LOW DIELECTRIC LOSS  GOOD THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY  AND RELATIVE AVAILABILITY.

THE TRANSITION PROCESS IS COMPLEX  FOLLOWING DIFFERENT PATHS DEPENDING ON MEAN FLOW PROPERTIES AND THE DISTURBANCE ENVIRONMENT. THIS COMPLEXITY IS COMPOUNDED BY ITS DEPENDENCE ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SURFACE OVER WHICH THE BOUNDARY LAYER FORMS. THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL TAKES ON THIS CHALLENGE BY ADDRESSING THE NUMERICAL MODELING OF TRANSITIONAL AND TURBULENT FLOWS OVER ABLATIVE SURFACES IN HYPERSONIC FLIGHT REGIMES  AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENT TO KENTUCKY S ESTABLISHED RESEARCH CAPABILITY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATING THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEMS (TPS) DURING HIGH-SPEED ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TRANSITIONAL/TURBULENT FLOWS AND SURFACE ABLATION HAVE FIRST-ORDER EFFECTS ON THE AERO-THERMODYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF AEROSPACE VEHICLES. HOWEVER  NO EXISTING SIMULATION CAPABILITY TRULY CAPTURES THE RELEVANT PHYSICAL MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN FULLY-COUPLED FLUID-ABLATION INTERACTIONS (FAI)  PARTICULARLY UNDER REALISTIC FLIGHT CONDITIONS. THUS  TRANSITION PREDICTION REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL CHALLENGE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF NASA APPLICATIONS  INVOLVING BOTH EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FLOWS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO DEVELOP A ROBUST  EFFICIENT  AND ACCURATE SIMULATION APPROACH THAT CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE HYPERSONIC AERO-THERMODYNAMIC PREDICTION CAPABILITIES  AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENHANCE OUR FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE COUPLED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TRANSITIONAL AND TURBULENT FLOWS WITH SURFACE ABLATION. TO OBTAIN ACCURATE AND EFFICIENT FAI SIMULATION CAPABILITIES ON RELEVANT TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES  THE PROPOSED NUMERICAL SCHEME CONSISTS OF FIVE KEY COMPONENTS: (1) A NONLINEAR DISTURBANCE FLOW FORMULATION  (2) A DUAL-MESH OVERSET APPROACH TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION BETWEEN THE BASE FLOW AND THE DISTURBANCE FLOW SOLUTIONS  (3) DYNAMIC ADAPTIVE-MESH REFINEMENT  (4) A HIGHER-ORDER ACCURATE IMMERSED BOUNDARY METHOD  AND (5) A DYNAMIC SOLID SURFACE RESPONSE MODEL. THESE METHODS WILL BE COMBINED AND USED TO SIMULATE HIGH-SPEED TRANSITIONAL AND TURBULENT FLOWS INTERACTING WITH ABLATIVE SURFACES  PARTICULARLY THE PRODUCTION OF MACROSCOPIC DISTRIBUTED AND DISCRETE ROUGHNESS PATTERNS FORMED IN THE PRESENCE OF TRANSITIONAL/TURBULENT FLOWS  AND TO COUPLE THE INFLUENCE OF THESE SURFACES  THROUGH ROUGHNESS PATTERNS AND OUTGASSING  BACK ONTO THE FLUID FLOW BEHAVIOR. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN EFFICIENT SIMULATION APPROACH THE COMPUTATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF THE SOLVER FRAMEWORK WILL BE THOROUGHLY ANALYZED AND OPTIMIZED ON MODERN HPC SYSTEMS EMPLOYING VECTORIZATION  INTER-PROCEDURAL OPTIMIZATION AND MULTI-THREADING. THE NUMERICAL METHOD DEVELOPMENT WILL BE SUPPORTED BY HIGH-FIDELITY EXPERIMENTS ON TRANSITIONAL AND TURBULENT FLOW OVER ROUGHENED SURFACES EMPLOYING AN ADVANCED SPATIO-TEMPORAL HIGH-RESOLUTION WAVE-PACKET TRACKING APPROACH. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE AND ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN PREDICTING HIGH-SPEED TRANSITIONAL AND TURBULENT FLOWS IN THE PRESENCE OF ABLATIVE SURFACES  AS WELL AS INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HIGHLY COMPLEX PHYSICS INVOLVED. IF FUNDED  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH BUILDS NOVEL RESEARCH EXPERTISE IN HIGH-SPEED LAMINAR-TURBULENT TRANSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY AND COMBINES IT WITH RECOGNIZED LEADING RESEARCH IN HEAT SHIELD MODELING. FOR THE DESIGN OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF CRITICAL TPS  RELIABLE MODELING CAPABILITIES FOR FAI ARE ESSENTIAL AN ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR NASA S AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR HUMANS TO GO AND RETURN FROM THE MOON  AS WELL AS FOR FUTURE MISSIONS TO VENUS  MARS AND BEYOND.  .", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c477975b-68db-c3dc-4a79-b95cb9f6ab3e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_80NSSC19M0144_8000"}, {"internal_id": 82498412, "Award ID": "80NSSC19M0143", "Award Amount": 750000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-07-05", "CFDA Number": "43.008", "Description": "NOVEL TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D)  ATOMICALLY FLAT MATERIALS  SUCH AS GRAPHENE AND TRANSITION-METAL DICHALCOGENIDES  EXHIBIT UNCONVENTIONAL DIRAC ELECTRONIC SPECTRA.

NASA HAS HAD INTEREST IN MFCS FOR SEVERAL YEARS  AS A POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGY TO TREAT HUMAN WASTE DURING SPACE MISSIONS  WHILE GENERATING ENERGY AND ALLOWING WATER RECOVERY. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP MFCS FOR SPACE LSS APPLICATIONS WITH A MAJOR MODIFICATION THAT RESULTS IN PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE INSTEAD OF  OR IN ADDITION TO  ELECTRICAL POWER. THE KEY ADVANTAGE IS THAT PEROXIDE  AN IMPORTANT CHEMICAL IN RELATION TO WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND/OR CLEANING IS PRODUCED. .THE PROPOSED PROJECT  BY FOCUSING ON LSS  ADDRESSES ONE OF THE KEY AREAS OF FOCUS OF THE HUMAN EXPLORATIONS AND OPERATIONS MISSION DIRECTORATE OF NASA. ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS OF LSS FOR SPACE MISSIONS IS THE RECOVERY OF WATER FROM WASTEWATER. ANOTHER IMPORTANT GOAL OF LSS IS THE PROVISION OF A SAFE HABITAT FOR CREW; HERE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGES IS TO ENSURE THAT SURFACES INSIDE SPACE VEHICLES ARE CLEAN  AND ESPECIALLY DEVOID OF BIOFILMS OF POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS MICROORGANISMS. MANY APPROACHES AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED  AND SOME ARE ALSO BEING TESTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TO ACHIEVE BOTH OF THESE GOALS  AND WE PROPOSE THAT MFCS COULD POTENTIALLY BE AN IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD ADDRESS BOTH NEEDS. .THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE PEROXIDE-PRODUCING MFCS FOR SPACE LSS APPLICATIONS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE  SEVERAL IMPORTANT CHALLENGES NEED TO BE OVERCOME  AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ANSWERED. EACH OF THESE CHALLENGES AND QUESTIONS FORM THE BASIS FOR FIVE TOTAL WORK PACKAGES FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT. EACH WORK PACKAGE INCLUDES ONE OR TWO KEY RESEARCH TASKS THAT THE PROPOSED RESEARCH SEEKS TO ADDRESS. THESE RESEARCH TASKS INCLUDE DETERMINATION OF THE MOST FEASIBLE HUMAN WASTE FEED FOR MFCS IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE AND RESILIENCE OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES THAT ESTABLISH IN THE ANODE CHAMBER  DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CATHODE ARCHITECTURES AND CONFIGURATIONS THAT ALLOW FOR HIGH PEROXIDE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES THROUGH IMPROVED PRODUCT TRANSPORT OUT OF THE CATALYST LAYER  TESTING OF MFC PROTOTYPES AT BOTH CLEMSON UNIVERSITY AND THE NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF ENGINEERING DESIGNS FOR POSSIBLE TESTING AT THE ISS  FOLLOWED BY EVALUATING THE BEST USE OF PEROXIDE WITH THE CONTEXT OF LSS APPLICATIONS. THE PROJECT WILL CONCLUDE WITH A THOROUGH ECONOMIC AND ENERGY ASSESSMENT OF PEROXIDE-PRODUCING MFCS AGAINST CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGIES FOR LSS APPLICATIONS INCLUDE WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND CLEANING. .THE PROPOSED PROJECT ALSO ADDRESSES SEVERAL ACTIVITIES HIGHLIGHTED IN SOUTH CAROLINA S VISION 2025 FOR ADVANCING CAPACITY AND EXPERTISE IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. BEYOND NASA S NEEDS  THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY ADDRESSES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AT THE NEXUS OF FOOD  WATER AND ENERGY  AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN GETTING INCREASING ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL INCLUDE COLLABORATIONS WITH TWO START-UP COMPANIES BASED IN SOUTH CAROLINA THAT FOCUS ON CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS NEXUS; THE PROJECT ALLOWS BUILDING RESEARCH CAPACITY THAT IS OF RELEVANCE TO INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL ALSO BE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN INVESTIGATORS AT THREE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION WITHIN SOUTH CAROLINA  ALLOWING FOR THE TRAINING OF FOUR PH.D.

BESIDES USING LIDARS FOR ALTIMETRY  THESE DEVICES HAVE BEEN USED TO STUDY ATMOSPHERES AND ICE. THE LIDAR IN-SPACE TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENT (LITE) IN THE 1990 S DEMONSTRATED A NUMBER OF CAPABILITIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS ON BOARD THE SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY. ONE NEW POTENTIAL APPLICATION IS THE USE OF LIDARS FOR PLANETARY SEISMOLOGY. TYPICALLY  SEISMOLOGISTS EXPLOIT MEASUREMENTS OF PRIMARY (P)  SECONDARY (S)  AND RAYLEIGH WAVES TO INFER STRUCTURE OF THE UNDERLYING PLANETARY BODY. THE P-WAVES ARE LONGITUDINAL WAVES WHICH TRAVEL AT THE COMPRESSIONAL WAVE SPEED IN THE BODY. THE S-WAVES OR SHEAR WAVES ARE TRANSVERSE WAVES WHICH TRAVEL AT THE SHEAR WAVE SPEED. RAYLEIGH WAVES ARE VERTICALLY- POLARIZED PROPAGATING WAVES THAT ARE TRAPPED AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN AN ELASTIC MEDIUM AND A VACUUM (OR LOW DENSITY ATMOSPHERE SUCH AS EARTH). THESE WAVES CAN PROPAGATE LARGE DISTANCE BECAUSE THEIR AMPLITUDES DECAY PRIMARILY AS ONE OVER SQUARE ROOT OF RANGE  AS OPPOSED TO COMPRESSIONAL (P) AND SHEAR (S) WAVES  WHICH DECAY AS ONE OF RANGE. RAYLEIGH WAVES ARE THE CAUSE OF MUCH DAMAGE DUE SEISMIC ACTIVITY ON EARTH BUT ALSO CAN BE EXCITED BY IMPACTORS ON THE MOONS AND ROCKY PLANETS. SUCH WAVES CAN PROPAGATE IN ICE SHEETS ON EUROPA. INTERFACE WAVES AT THE SEABED ARE CALLED SCHOLTE WAVES AND THOSE WAVES AT THE INTERFACE OF TWO ELASTIC MEDIA ARE CALLED STONELY WAVES. THE DISPERSION OF THE SPEED OF RAYLEIGH WAVES (OFTEN REFERRED TO AS P-SV WAVES) AS A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY IS DEPENDENT ON THE UNDERLYING VERTICAL PROFILE OF ELASTIC MEDIUM PROPERTIES SUCH AS THE SHEAR MODULUS/SPEED. A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE ESTIMATION OF THE VERTICAL SHEAR SPEED GIVEN MEASUREMENTS OF RAYLEIGH WAVE DISPERSION FROM EXPLOSIONS  IMPACTS AND OTHER ENERGETIC SOURCES. MEASUREMENTS OF RAYLEIGH WAVES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN TAKEN USING GEOPHONES AT LOW FREQUENCIES AND ACCELEROMETERS AT MID- TO HIGH FREQUENCIES. RECENTLY  WE HAVE DEVELOPED CHIRP LASERS TO MEASURE BOTH RANGE AND SURFACE MOTION THROUGH A NASA-EPSCOR RESEARCH SEED GRANT. HERE  WE PROPOSE TO BUILD A LOW SWAP-C (SIZE  WEIGHT  POWER AND COST) WITH TWO OPERATIONAL MODES (RANGING MODE AND DOPPLER MODE) FOR REMOTE SURFACE MEASUREMENT. UNDER RANGING MODE  THE LIDAR SENDS OFF CHIRPED LASER PULSE FOR FREQUENCY MODULATED CONTINUOUS WAVE (FMCW) BASED RANGING OPERATION. UNDER DOPPLER MODE  THE LASER OUTPUTS A HIGH-QUALITY NARROW-LINEWIDTH SINGLE WAVELENGTH LASER  AND RECEIVES THE BEAT SIGNAL BETWEEN THE INCIDENT WAVE AND REFLECTION WAVE TO MEASURE THE SURFACE VELOCITY. THE DUALMODE LIDAR WILL BE BUILT AROUND A DIGITAL CIRCUIT  THE MODE CAN BE CONTROLLED DIGITALLY AND REMOTELY  AND THE SWITCH TIME IS WELL WITHIN 1 MS. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE STUDY  THE SCIENCE PI (T. WEI  URI) AND TEAM (G. POTTY AND J. H. MILLER  ALSO URI) PROPOSE TO (A) INVESTIGATE THE ENGINEERING AND SIGNAL PROCESSING; AND (B) DEVELOP A MODEL TO PRODUCE SYNTHETIC GROUND MOTION DATA AND RESULTING MODELED LASER PULSE RETURNS. IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THE PROJECT  WE PROPOSE TO DEMONSTRATE THE CHIRP LASER IN A LABORATORY SETTING USING TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED BY THE P.I.S DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE ALSO FORESEE THE CONTINUED MODELING EFFORTS RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALGORITHMS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF GROUND PROPERTIES. IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE PROJECT  WE PROPOSE TO DEMONSTRATE A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM IN A FIELD EXPERIMENT. THE FIELD EXPERIMENT WOULD INVOLVE MEASURING BOTH ALTITUDE AND GROUND MOTION USING A CHIRP LASER ON BOARD A MOVING AERIAL PLATFORM SUCH AS A DRONE  HELICOPTER OR SMALL AIRCRAFT.

THIS MISSION ALIGNS WITH KENTUCKY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY  WHICH STRESSES THE TRANSITION TO ADVANCED MANUFACTURING  LEVERAGING GROWTH AREAS LIKE AEROSPACE  AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATION ECONOMY DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTHS OF ITS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM: CUTTING-EDGE R&D AND A HIGHLY EDUCATED WORKFORCE. SUPPORTING THIS STATEWIDE MISSION  NASA KENTUCKY EPSCOR'S GOALS ARE TO ENHANCE CAPACITY THROUGH STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NASAPRIORITY RESEARCH AREAS AND TO INCREASE RESEARCHER COMPETITIVENESS FOR NON-EPSCOR NASA FUNDING. A KEY FACTOR IN ACHIEVING THE LATTER GOAL IS INITIATION OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KENTUCKY S AND NASA S RESEARCHERS THAT CAN DEVELOP INTO PARTNERSHIPS. EVERY ASPECT OF THE CURRENT RID PORTFOLIO EMPHASIZES THIS PROCESS OF RELATIONSHIP-BUILDING  INCLUDING PURSUING COLLABORATIONS THAT ENABLE COMMERCIAL SPACE PARTNERSHIPS. TO REACH THESE GOALS  FOUR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE NASA KENTUCKY EPSCOR PROGRAM ALIGN WITH THOSE OF THE NASA EPSCOR PROGRAM: 1) TO DEVELOP HUMAN RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IN AREAS STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT TO NASA  2) TO GAIN SUPPORT FROM NON-EPSCOR SOURCES  3) TO DEVELOP NASA PARTNERSHIPS  4) TO DEVELOP SCIENCE  TECHNOLOGY AND ECONOMIC CAPACITY. THE CENTERPIECE OF THE NASA KY EPSCOR RID PROGRAM IS THE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT GRANT (RIDG) COMPETITIVELY AWARDED TO FACULTY FOR ONE YEAR.

THE PROBLEM AT HAND IS HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE SURVIVABILITY OF SENSORS  ELECTRONICS AND OTHER COMPONENTS ON FUTURE VENUS SURFACE LANDERS UNDER THE EXTREME VENUS AMBIENT (~500  C  90 EARTH ATM  HIGHLY ACIDIC ATMOSPHERE  ETC). AMONG THE MANY CHALLENGES FACED BY POTENTIAL LONG DURATION LANDED MISSIONS  THE MOST PROMINENT ONE IS MAINTAINING THE OPERATION OF ON-BOARD INSTRUMENTS WITH MINIMAL OR NO ACTIVE THERMAL CONTROL FOR EXTENDED PERIODS [1]. THESE SO-CALLED MID-TERM MISSIONS ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE GEOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF VENUS SUCH AS HEAT FLOW  SEISMOLOGY  AND GEODESY.

THE THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTY MEASUREMENTS WILL USE THE JAPAN AEROSPACE EXPLORATION AGENCY ELECTROSTATIC LEVITATION FURNACE. THE CASTING SIMULATION REQUIRES PRECISE AND ACCURATE THERMOPHYSICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DURING THE ENTIRE SOLIDIFICATION PROCESS. AMONG THE REQUIRED THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES ARE THE VISCOSITY  SURFACE TENSION  DENSITY  AND HEAT CAPACITY  AMONG OTHERS. METALS AND METALLIC ALLOYS OFTEN HAVE HIGH MELTING TEMPERATURES AND HIGHLY REACTIVE LIQUID STATES. THUS  PROCESSING THESE LIQUIDS IN CONTAINERS LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT CONTAMINATION AND UNCONTROLLED UNDER-COOLING BEHAVIOR. THE ABOVE IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MOLTEN SILICON AND ITS ALLOYS. THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THESE REACTIVE MATERIALS CAN BE DETERMINED BY USING AN ELECTROSTATIC LEVITATOR (ESL) WHICH LEVITATES AND SUSPENDS A SAMPLE BETWEEN TWO ELECTRODES AND SUBSEQUENTLY ANALYZING (HIGH-SPEED) VIDEO AND TEMPERATURE (PYROMETER) DATA OF THE MOLTEN LEVITATED SAMPLES  RATHER THAN USING TRADITIONAL CONTACT TECHNIQUES. THIS MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE ELIMINATES MANY SOURCES OF EXPERIMENTAL ERROR  DUE TO THE INHERENT NON-CONTACT NATURE OF THE ESL. THERE IS MINIMAL CONTAMINATION BETWEEN THE SAMPLE AND ITS CONTAINER  DUE TO THE LEVITATION  AND THE EXPERIMENTS ARE DONE UNDER VACUUM  LIMITING THE EFFECTS OF SURROUNDING GASES. THE ESL ALSO OFFERS THE ADVANTAGES THAT A SINGLE SAMPLE CAN BE HEATED AND COOLED MULTIPLE TIMES BETWEEN A WIDE RANGE OF TEMPERATURES; SAMPLES CAN BE UNDER-COOLED TO A HIGH DEGREE; VISCOSITY AND SURFACE TENSION CAN BOTH BE OBTAINED FROM A SINGLE TRANSIENT SIGNAL; AND WITH A SINGLE AXISYMMETRIC OSCILLATION INDUCED IN THE SAMPLE  THE DATA ANALYSIS BECOMES CLEAR AND RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD. DENSITY AND HEAT CAPACITY ARE PERFORMED AS A SEPARATE BUT PAIRED SET OF EXPERIMENTS. SILICON-TRANSITION METAL ALLOYS MAINTAIN THE LOWER DENSITY  HIGH COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH  AND MITIGATE THE BRITTLENESS OF PURE SILICON. WHILE SILICON ITSELF IS CORROSION RESISTANT  IT WETS AND DISSOLVES ALL BUT A FEW MATERIALS; MOLTEN SILICON IS COMMONLY CALLED  THE UNIVERSAL SOLVENT . THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-DENSITY (LOW-MASS)  HIGH STRENGTH  COMPRESSION ALLOYS FOR SPACE MISSIONS WOULD ENABLE LOWER MASS COMPONENTS RESULTING IN LESS VEHICLE MASS AND HIGHER DURABILITY. THE WETTING ABILITY OF MOLTEN SILICON COUPLED WITH ITS HIGH MELTING POINT MAKES THE DETERMINATION OF ITS THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES EXPERIMENTALLY CHALLENGING. SILICON AND SILICON-TRANSITION METAL ALLOYS ARE SYSTEMS THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BENEFITS OF CONTAINERLESS PROCESSING  OR LEVITATION FACILITIES IN A LOW GRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. SILICON IS A SEMICONDUCTOR OR SEMI-METAL DEPENDING ON THE TEMPERATURE. THE LEVITATION AND MELTING OF SILICON IN TERRESTRIAL ELECTROSTATIC LEVITATOR SYSTEMS REQUIRES CLOSE ATTENTION AND ADJUSTMENT OF THE SAMPLE SIZE  HEATING AND LEVITATION PARAMETERS. OFF-EUTECTIC ALLOYS ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO PROCESS SINCE DURING MELTING THERE IS A MIXTURE OF LIQUID AND SOLID.

WE WILL DISCOVER THESE AGN BY DEVELOPING AN  AGN PATROL  AS PART OF THE ONGOING ALL-SKY AUTOMATED SURVEY FOR SUPERNOVAE (ASAS-SN)  A NETWORK OF TELESCOPES WITH A DEDICATED ALL-SKY TRANSIENT SURVEY. THIS AGN PATROL WILL MONITOR ALL AGN IN ORDER TO DETECT AGN OUTBURSTS AT THEIR EARLIEST DETECTION AND THUS ENABLE US TO COORDINATE MULTI-WAVELENGTH FOLLOW-UP OBSERVATIONS WITH THE SWIFT OBSERVATORY. THE TESS DATA WILL BE A CORNERSTONE OF THE AGN PATROL ANALYSIS. ASAS-SN IS PLANNING TO MONITOR THE NORTHERN TESS FIELDS AT 6 HOUR CADENCE  WHICH AUTOMATICALLY ENABLES A SEARCH FOR CONTINUUM LAGS OF ANY HIGHLY VARIABLE AGN IN THE FIELDS-OF-VIEW USING A BLUE ASAS-SN GBAND LIGHT CURVE AND RED TESS LIGHT CURVE.

MINORITY ENROLLMENT AT PIERCE COLLEGE IS OVER 60% WITH HISPANIC STUDENTS MAKING UP THE MAJORITY OF OUR MINORITY ENROLLMENT. OUR HIGH MINORITY ENROLLMENT PLACES PIERCE COLLEGE IN THE POSITION TO TEAM WITH NASA IN ORDER TO FULFILL BOTH INSTITUTIONS GOAL OF PROVIDING RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO MINORITY STUDENTS. THE MINORITY UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROGRAM (MUREP) RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE INNOVATIONS IN SPACE TECHNOLOGY CURRICULUM (MISTC) DIRECTLY AIMED AT TWO-YEAR  MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS; THIS DESCRIPTION PERFECTLY FITS PIERCE COLLEGE. MISTC SEEKS PROPOSALS AIMING TO ACCOMPLISH THREE PRIMARY GOALS: (1)  REVISE OR DEVELOP AT LEAST ONE NEW COURSE THAT WILL INTRODUCE AND ENHANCE STUDENT UNDERSTANDING OF SPACE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT; (2) IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CAMPUS LABORATORY EQUIPMENT NEEDS TO SUPPORT STUDENT LEARNING IN THE COURSE(S); AND (3) HANDS-ON LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO THE COURSE(S) THROUGH INTERNSHIPS AT NASA CENTERS OR FACILITIES. PIERCE COLLEGE CAN ACCOMPLISH ALL THREE GOALS AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. FIRST  WE CURRENTLY OFFER A LECTURE CLASS ENTITLED  INTRODUCTION TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM . TO ADDRESS MISTC S FIRST GOAL WE WILL DEVELOP A LAB COURSE TO GO ALONGSIDE THE LECTURE AND MAKE MINOR MODIFICATIONS TO THE LECTURE COURSE SO THAT BOTH COURSES TIE INTO EACH OTHER FULLY. SECOND  BASED ON OUR CURRENT PLANS FOR THIS LAB COURSE WE HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED CAMPUS LABORATORY NEEDS. HOWEVER  WE WILL ALSO TEAM WITH OUR PARTNER NASA CENTER TO FIND ANY ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT OR RESOURCES NECESSARY TO FULFILLING THE GOALS OF BOTH COURSES. THIRD  WE AIM TO DEVELOP A PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA S JET PROPULSION LABORATORY (JPL) TO PROVIDE HANDS-ON LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND INTERNSHIPS FOR OUR PARTICIPATING MINORITY STUDENTS. WE BELIEVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA THROUGH MISTC COULD GREATLY BENEFIT OUR STUDENTS. THE GOAL OF MANY OF OUR STUDENTS IN ATTENDING PIERCE COLLEGE IS TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR-YEAR SCHOOL. IN ORDER TO TRANSFER THEY MUST MEET A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AS LISTED IN THE INTERSEGMENTAL GENERAL EDUCATION TRANSFER CURRICULUM (IGETC) OR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY GENERAL EDUCATION BREADTH REQUIREMENTS (CSU GE). IN PARTICULAR  STUDENTS MUST COMPLETE A PHYSICAL SCIENCE LECTURE AND LAB COURSE (IGETC 5 AND CSU GE B1 AND B3). CURRENTLY  A STUDENT THAT TAKES OUR INTRODUCTION TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM COURSE WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED TO TAKE ANOTHER PHYSICAL SCIENCE LECTURE IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN A LAB COURSE. INTERNAL RESEARCH ON STUDENT OUTCOMES SHOWS MANY STUDENTS ARE PROGRESSIVELY LESS LIKELY TO TRANSFER AS THEY ACCUMULATE UNITS BEYOND THE MINIMUM NEEDED FOR THE IGETC AND CSU TRANSFER PROGRAMS. ADDING A LAB COURSE TO OUR CURRENT LECTURE COURSE MEANS THAT STUDENTS WOULD HAVE A MORE DIRECT PATH TO TRANSFER SINCE THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO TAKE ADDITIONAL CLASSES IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR LAB REQUIREMENT TO TRANSFER. WE ALSO BELIEVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA THROUGH MISTC COULD GREATLY BENEFIT NASA AND THE LOCAL SPACE AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. LOS ANGELES HAS A PARTICULARLY LARGE SPACE AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRY.

KEY WASTE STREAMS TO BE EXPECTED INCLUDE (1) BLACK WATER (TOILET-DERIVED); (2) FOOD WASTES (KITCHEN-DERIVED); AND  (3) GREY WATER (AKA. HYGIENE WATER). FURTHER  WATER AND OXYGEN WILL BOTH NEED TO BE CONSERVED AND RECYCLED. THEREFORE  TO SUSTAIN HUMAN LIFE DURING EXTENDED OFF-EARTH EXCURSIONS  RECOVERY OF THE CARBON  OXYGEN  AND HYDROGEN ALONG WITH THE MICROCHEMICALS MAKING UP THE FOOD  WATER  AND AIR PROVIDED TO THE ASTRONAUTS IS NEEDED TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF EXPENSIVE MAKEUP DELIVERIES OF THESE LIFE SUPPORT PRODUCTS. THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO RECOVER RESOURCES MUST OPERATE USING COMPACT  LOW WEIGHT DESIGNS; UTILIZE MINIMAL ENERGY AND OXYGEN FOOTPRINTS; BE SIMPLE TO OPERATE WITH LOW MAINTENANCE; AND  RECOVER A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE LIFE SUPPORT RESOURCE CHEMICALS THAT CAN PLACED BACK INTO BENEFICIAL USE. THE IDEAL SYSTEM SHOULD ALSO BE FLEXIBLE AND CONTAIN BUILT-IN FAILSAFE MECHANISMS THAT CAN ADJUST AS UNPLANNED EVENTS OCCUR; YET  MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL CAPACITY.

THE BIOSYS CONCEPT IS BASED ON A SERIES OF SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS PERFORMED BY THE PROJECT TEAM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS THAT FOCUSED ON CONVERTING WASTEWATER INTO VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS. THE KEY DEVELOPMENT GOALS FOR THE BIOSYS PROJECT ARE (A) BE ENERGY AND OXYGEN USE NEUTRAL; (B) HAVE A COMPACT PROCESS FOOTPRINT AND LOW PAYLOAD WEIGHT; (C) BE CAPABLE OF TREATING WATER AND AIR TO REUSABLE QUALITIES; AND  (D) BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING CO-PRODUCTS THAT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR LIFE SUPPORT. THE PRIMARY BIOSYS CONCEPT DESIGN UTILIZES A SERIES OF TREATMENT STEPS TO CONVERT WASTEWATER CONSTITUENTS AND CABIN CO2 INTO RECOVERED BENEFICIAL LIFE SUPPORT PRODUCTS. THE DESIGN IS COMPOSED OF BOTH ANAEROBIC AND AEROBIC BIOREACTOR UNITS; LIPIDS EXTRACTION; A MICROALGAE REACTOR; AND AN ADSORPTION POLISHING STEP. THIS DESIGN RESULTS IN THE TREATMENT OF THE CONTAMINANTS IN THE WATER TO ESSENTIALLY ZERO CONCENTRATIONS.

THE DESIGN OF THIS RADAR WAS CONCEIVED IN APPROXIMATELY 2010  WITH A VISION THAT A TERRESTRIAL RADAR WOULD BE DEVELOPED FIRST  WHICH WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR THE DESIGN OF A SPACE-BORNE RADAR IN THE FUTURE. A RECENT PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE OU TEAM AND GSFC RESULTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED DIGITAL RADAR TECHNIQUES FOR ECOSAR. THESE TECHNIQUES HAVE ENABLED A NEW CLASS OF RADAR OPERATIONS THAT IMPROVED SCIENCE  ENHANCED SYSTEM PERFORMANCE  FACILITATED A PATH FOR SPACE-BORNE IMPLEMENTATION  AND PUSHED TECHNOLOGY BEYOND THE CURRENT STATE-OFTHE- ART  WHILE KEEPING THE COSTS LOW. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED EFFORT IS TO COMBINE THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED DIGITAL RADAR TECHNIQUES WITH NEW AND INNOVATIVE  ADAPTIVE RADAR HARDWARE TO HELP NASA MOVE TOWARDS SPACE-BORNE APPLICATIONS OF NEW RADAR SYSTEMS LIKE ECOSAR. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY SPLITTING THE EFFORT INTO FIVE TASKS: 1) TRANSMIT/RECEIVE MODULE DEVELOPMENT. THE TRANSITION FROM TERRESTRIAL TO SPACE-BORNE NECESSITATES HIGHER TRANSMITTER POWER LEVELS  WHICH WILL RESULT IN SIGNAL DEGRADATION DUE TO NON-LINEAR BEHAVIOR OF THE ELECTRONICS AS WELL AS INCREASED POWER CONSUMPTION. THESE ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED BY DESIGNING A NEW HIGH-EFFICIENCY POWER AMPLIFIER WITH IMPROVED LINEARITY FROM USING DIGITAL PREDISTORTION. 2) RADAR FAIRING DESIGN  FLIGHT EXPERIMENTS  AND DATA COLLECTION. NASA S DIGITAL BEAMFORMING SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (DBSAR-2) WILL BE USED TO TEST ENGINEERING IDEAS AND COLLECT HIGH QUALITY RADAR DATASETS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT  DBSAR-2 NEEDS TO BE PREPARED FOR FLIGHT. A FAIRING WILL BE DESIGNED AND FLIGHT EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED. 3) SPACE-BORNE ANTENNA DESIGN. FOR ANY ANTENNA TO BE DEPLOYED IN SPACE  ITS SIZE AND WEIGHT ARE MAJOR CONCERNS. A NEW MINIATURIZED ANTENNA DESIGN WILL BE PURSUED AND AN ADAPTIVE MATCHING NETWORK WILL BE DESIGNED AND INTEGRATED. THE PURPOSE OF THE MATCHING NETWORK IS TO INCREASE THE ANGULAR SCANNING CAPABILITIES OF THE RADAR. SCIENTIFICALLY  THIS WILL ALLOW THE RADAR TO CREATE IMAGERY AT WIDER ANGLES. 4) WAVEFORM OPTIMIZATION. THE QUALITY OF THE WAVEFORM USED IN THE SAR ALGORITHMS WILL BE ANALYZED AND OPTIMIZED. MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION METHODS WILL BE UTILIZED TO DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF WAVEFORM IS BEST-SUITED FOR OPTIMAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. 5) METEOROLOGICAL SCIENCES. IN THIS TASK  PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED TERRESTRIAL DATA FROM SURFACE  AIRBORNE  AND CURRENT NASA SPACE-BORNE REMOTE SENSING PLATFORMS WILL BE ANALYZED. A KEY COMPONENT OF THE WORK WILL SERVE TO BRIDGE THE CRITICAL DESIGN ELEMENTS AND ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS OF THE HARDWARE DESIGN WITH THE ENCOMPASSING NEEDS OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY FOCUSED ON ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN RELATION TO CRITICAL DRIVERS INCLUDING WEATHER  CLIMATE  AND AVAILABLE WATER RESOURCES.

THIS TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS FOR COHERENT COMBINING AT THE ANALOG FRONT-END. 3) HARDWARE REDUCTIONS AT THE BACK-END BY ELIMINATING LOCAL OSCILLATOR (LO) TUNING. INSTEAD  OUR NEW CONCEPT EMPLOYS A SINGLE LO OPERATING AT ONE CONSTANT AND CONVENIENT FREQUENCY  REGARDLESS OF OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND BANDWIDTH AT THE RECEIVER.

HOWEVER  SANDWICH COMPOSITES ARE PRONE TO DAMAGE DUE TO IMPACTS. LOW ENERGY OR BARELY VISIBLE IMPACT DAMAGE CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LOSS IN LOAD CARRYING CAPACITY. PREDICTING THE EFFECT OF LOW VELOCITY IMPACT DAMAGE ON SANDWICH COMPOSITES ON THEIR RESIDUAL STRENGTH AND LIFE OF A COMPONENT IS CRITICAL TO ASSURE MISSION SUCCESS. TO ASSESS DAMAGE TOLERANCE AND ENSURE SAFETY OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES A NUMBER OF MODEL CALIBRATIONS AND VALIDATION TESTS NEED TO BE PERFORMED. TESTING COSTS LIMIT THE NUMBER OF DESIGN CONFIGURATIONS  LOAD RANGES AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS THAT CAN BE EXPLORED; THEREFORE  THE VALIDITY OF CALIBRATED MODELS IS LIMITED TO SMALL DESIGN REGIONS. WHEN SITUATIONS OR DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FORCE PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OUTSIDE THE CALIBRATED DESIGN RANGE ADDITIONAL TESTS ARE NEEDED. FAILURE IN SANDWICH COMPOSITES INCLUDES DAMAGE TO THE COMPOSITE FACESHEET  DELAMINATION CRACKS AT THE FACESHEET-CORE INTERFACE OR DAMAGE TO THE SANDWICH CORE. POLYMER MATRIX IN COMPOSITES EXHIBIT VISCOELASTIC AND/OR VISCOPLASTIC RESPONSE UNDER IMPACT LOADS. THE DYNAMIC PROGRESSIVE FAILURE OF COMPOSITE UNDER TRANSIENT DYNAMICS LOAD HAS NOT BEEN AS FULLY EXPLORED AND VALIDATED. WE WILL INVESTIGATE MODELING APPROACHES TO PREDICT THE PLY LEVEL TRANSIENT AND INTERFACE DAMAGE RESPONSE IN COMPOSITES UNDER IMPACT LOADS. SANDWICH CORE FAILURE IS DRIVEN BY BUCKLING AND/OR PLASTIC COLLAPSE OF HONEYCOMB CELLS WALLS. ELASTIC RESPONSE OF HONEYCOMB CORES ARE MODELLED WITH EQUIVALENT HOMOGENIZED ORTHOTROPIC MATERIAL MODELS. RECENTLY RESEARCHERS HAVE PROPOSED HOMOGENIZATION TECHNIQUES FOR PLASTIC RESPONSE OF CELLULAR STRUCTURES. WE WILL EXPLORE THE USE OF HOMOGENIZATION MODELS FOR THE VISCOPLASTIC RESPONSE OF SANDWICH CORES UNDER IMPACT TO PREDICT THE STATE OF THE CORE AFTER IMPACT. DELAMINATION OF FACESHEET FROM CORE IS AN IMPORTANT FAILURE MODE IN SANDWICH COMPOSITES. THE INTERFACE FAILURE OF THE FACESHEET CORE IS COMPLEX AND CAN HAPPEN IN DIFFERENT MODES (E.G. COHESIVE FAILURE OF RESIN OR ADHESIVE FAILURE OF CELL WALL OR FACESHEET). IN QUASI STATIC PROGRESSIVE FAILURE ANALYSIS THE INTERFACE FAILURE IS MODELLED IN FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSES USING COHESIVE ZONE MODELS. WE WILL INVESTIGATE COHESIVE ZONE MODELING APPROACHES FOR THE DYNAMIC FRACTURE OF THE SANDWICH FACESHEET AND CORE INTERFACE.

NITINOL 60 IS CURRENTLY UNDER EXTENSIVE EVALUATION AT NASA DUE TO ITS UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES THAT MAKE IT VERY DESIRABLE FOR NASA S SPACE MECHANISMS AND AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER  IT HAS POOR FRICTION AND WEAR PERFORMANCES IN DRY CONTACT CONDITIONS. THE PROPOSED NOVEL COATINGS CONSIST OF A BIO-INSPIRED POLYDOPAMINE (PDA) ADHESIVE UNDER-LAYER AND A PTFE OR A MIXED PTFE AND GRAPHITE SOLID LUBRICANT TOP-LAYER. THE COATINGS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE FRICTION OF THE NITINOL 60 MATERIAL BY OVER 85% AND ITS WEAR RATE BY 50% DURING DRY CONTACT CONDITIONS TO MEET A RANGE OF NASA S CRITICAL APPLICATION NEEDS. SPECIFICALLY  THE NOVEL COATINGS WILL ENABLE NITINOL 60 BALL BEARINGS AND TIMING GEARS TO BE DEVELOPED FOR USE IN THE WATER RECOVERY SYSTEM OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) TO COMBAT CURRENT ISSUES WITH THESE TRIBOLOGICAL COMPONENTS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BE PERFORMED COLLABORATIVELY BY THREE INVESTIGATORS FROM THREE DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES IN TWO ARKANSAS UNIVERSITIES. THE PROJECT WILL INTEGRATE COATING PROCESS DEVELOPMENT  COMPUTATIONAL AND ANALYTICAL MODELING  AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION TO ADDRESS NASA S CRITICAL NEEDS IN SOLID LUBRICATION OF NITINOL 60. THE RESEARCH WILL BE CLOSELY GUIDED BY NASA SENIOR SCIENTISTS DRS. CHRISTOPHER DELLACORTE AND SAMUEL A. HOWARD FROM THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) AND INTEGRATE WITH THEIR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO ENSURE ITS DIRECT BENEFIT TO NASA. THE PROJECT GOAL WILL BE ATTAINED BY ACCOMPLISHING THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: 1) DEVELOP PROCESSES TO FABRICATE BIO-INSPIRED PTFE-BASED SOLID LUBRICANT COATINGS ON NITINOL 60 SUBSTRATES (ZOU)  2) EXPERIMENTALLY EVALUATE THE MECHANICAL AND TRIBOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE COATED NITINOL 60 (ZOU)  3) GAIN A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE ADHESION MECHANISMS OF PDA/PTFE COATING ON NITINOL 60 THROUGH MULTI-SCALE MODELING  WHICH WILL PROVIDE FEEDBACK FOR EXPERIMENTAL REFINEMENT OF THE SOLID LUBRICANT COATINGS (WANG)  AND 4) DEVELOP ANALYTICAL MODELS TO PREDICT STATIC AND DYNAMIC PERFORMANCES OF THE COATED NITNINOL 60 BEARINGS (MILLER). THE PROPOSED COATING TECHNOLOGIES ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE HUMAN EXPLORATION&OPERATIONS MISSION DIRECTORATE (HEOMD) FOR IMPROVING THE WASTE WATER PROCESSING BEARINGS AND GEARS IN THE ISS  THE NEEDS OF THE SPACE TECHNOLOGY MISSION DIRECTORATE (STMD) FOR RESILIENT MECHANICAL SYSTEMS IN LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR LONG TERM EXPLORATION  AND THE NEEDS OF THE AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE (ARMD) FOR LIGHTWEIGHT AIRCRAFT COMPONENTS. THE SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED COATINGS CAN BE APPLIED TO SHOCKPROOF AND CORROSION PROOF BEARINGS FOR SPACESUITS; LIFE SUPPORT MACHINERY; GUIDANCE  NAVIGATION  AND CONTROL MECHANISMS; AND OTHER MECHANISMS THAT REQUIRE SOLID LUBRICATION. THE PROJECT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS AMONG ARKANSAS UNIVERSITIES  NASA GRC  AND ARKANSAS INDUSTRIES. IT WILL STRENGTHEN ARKANSAS S RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES IN ADVANCED MATERIALS  WHICH IS ONE OF THE SIX ECONOMIC CLUSTERS IN ARKANSAS. DUE TO THE VERSATILITY OF THE PROPOSED COATING SYSTEM  THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING GAINED FROM THIS RESEARCH AND THE COATING TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED CAN BE APPLIED TO IMPROVE THE DURABILITY OF SURFACES OF VARIOUS MECHANICAL COMPONENTS USED IN ARKANSAS MANUFACTURING  AEROSPACE  DEFENSE  AGRICULTURE  AND GAS AND OIL INDUSTRIES. WE ALSO PLAN TO COMMERCIALIZE THE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY PARTNERING WITH NASA AND ARKANSAS-BASED COMPANIES.

RESEARCH OF ANTHONY GARGANO. IT INTEGRATES THE EXPERTISE OF JUSTIN SIMON AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER (JSC) WITH THAT OF PH.D. ADVISOR ZACHARY SHARP AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO. THE RESEARCH PLAN CREATES A FAR BROADER RESEARCH EXPERIENCE THAN WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE JSC CONNECTION. MR. GARGANO WILL STUDY THE CHLORINE AND HYDROGEN ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY OF PRIMITIVE CHONDRITES IN ORDER TO BETTER ASCERTAIN THE SOURCES OF VOLATILES INCORPORATED IN THESE BODIES  AND ULTIMATELY IN THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS. THE PROPOSED COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CENTER FOR STABLE ISOTOPES  UNM AND JSC WILL GREATLY AUGMENT THE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE OF MR. GARGANO BY INCLUDING THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT JSC WITH THOSE AT CSI. DR. SIMON HAS SPENT THE LAST SIX YEARS WORKING WITH SUMMER INTERNS ON THE PETROGRAPHY AND TEXTURES OF PRIMITIVE METEORITES AND WILL WORK WITH MR. GARGANO OVER THE THREE SUMMERS OF HIS RESEARCH AT JSC ON THIS CRITICAL COMPLIMENT TO THE H AND CL ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY  WHICH WILL BE MADE AT UNM. MR. GARGANO WILL ALSO BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE ANTARCTIC METEORITE COLLECTION  FINDING APPROPRIATE SAMPLES FOR HIS RESEARCH AND GAINING A FULLER KNOWLEDGE OF THE TYPES OF METEORITES THAT EXIST. FINALLY  HE WILL WORK WITH DR. SIMON AND DR. SCOTT MESSENGER USING THE NANOSIMS IN ORDER TO MAKE HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION H AND CL ISOTOPE MEASUREMENTS OF SUBDOMAINS IN SELECTED SAMPLES. THE ION MICROPROBE WORK WILL ALLOW FOR MR. GARGANO TO DISENTANGLE THE ISOTOPE SIGNATURES OF DISTINCT PHASES FROM THE BULK ROCK SAMPLES. MR. GARGANO S ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE IS TO BECOME PART OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF PLANETARY SCIENTISTS  AND THE ADDITION OF THE NASA PORTION OF HIS RESEARCH WILL MAKE HIS PH.D. A FAR RICHER EXPERIENCE THAN IF HE WERE TO WORK ONLY AT UNM. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THERE ARE DISTINCT H AND CL RESERVOIRS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE VOLATILE CONTENTS OF CHONDRITES. NEBULAR HYDROGEN SHOULD HAVE AN EXTREMELY LOW D/H RATIO. WATER ICE SHOULD HAVE A HIGHER D/H RATIO AND ORGANIC HYDROGEN SHOULD HAVE AN EXTREMELY HIGH D/H RATIO. OXIDATION OF ORGANIC MATERIAL AND/OR REDUCTION OF H2O SHOULD RESULT IN A WATER COMPONENT WITH A HIGH D/H RATIO  BUT LOWER THAN THE EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH D/H RATIO OF ORGANIC MATTER. THE SOLAR NEBULA CL ISOTOPE COMPOSITION IS LIGHT  AND IS PRESERVED IN SOME METEORITES AND PRIMITIVE MARTIAN METEORITES  WHILE CL FROM HCL-HYDRATES IS HEAVY. COMBINING THE TWO ISOTOPE SYSTEMS WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER CONSTRAIN THE VOLATILE SOURCES OF CHONDRITES. MR. GARGANO S ULTIMATE PROFESSIONAL GOAL IS TO BE PART OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF PLANETARY SCIENTISTS. THIS FITS INTO THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY  THE NASA EDUCATION AERONAUTICS SCHOLARSHIP AND ADVANCED STEM TRAINING AND RESEARCH (AS&ASTAR) FELLOWSHIP ACTIVITY. AS STATED IN THE PROPOSAL ANNOUNCEMENT  THIS GRANT WILL STRENGTHEN  INVOLVEMENT WITH HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO ENSURE THAT NASA CAN MEET FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS IN STEM FIELDS.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BRING TOGETHER THE EXPERTISE OF THE CENTER FOR STABLE ISOTOPES (CSI) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO WITH THAT OF JSC. THE CSI HAS DEVELOPED THE UNIQUE CAPABILITY TO MEASURE ULTRA-SMALL QUANTITIES OF CL AND H IN BULK SAMPLES. JSC HAS A LONG HISTORY OF EXCELLENCE IN UNDERSTANDING THE PETROGRAPHY AND MINERALOGY OF METEORITE SAMPLES AND HAS A NANOSIMS THAT IS TAILORED TO METEORITE STUDIES. MR. GARGANO S RESEARCH PROPOSAL WILL INTRODUCE HIM TO THE PHILOSOPHY AND RESEARCH TEAM AT JSC AND GIVE HIM HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE WITH THE ANTARCTIC METEORITE COLLECTION  ARGUABLY THE FINEST COLLECTION OF FRESH METEORITES IN THE WORLD.
