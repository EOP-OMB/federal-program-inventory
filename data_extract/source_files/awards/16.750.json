THE DRU SJODIN NATIONAL SEX OFFENDER PUBLIC WEBSITE (NSOPW), THE SORNA EXCHANGE PORTAL (THE PORTAL), THE TRIBE AND TERRITORY SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY SYSTEM (TTSORS), AND THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY TOOL (SORT) ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS STRATEGY. THE CHALLENGES OF MANAGING THE RESOURCES ARE NUMEROUS. THEY INCLUDE MANAGING ELABORATE TECHNICAL APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEMS, FOSTERING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS, PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR A VARIETY OF ISSUES, BUILDING FLEXIBLE APPLICATIONS THAT CAN INTERFACE WITH A VARIETY OF SYSTEMS, AND IDENTIFYING NEW STRATEGIES THAT IMPROVE COLLABORATION.
