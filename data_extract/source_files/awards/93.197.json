SINCE THE 1970S, EXTENSIVE PUBLIC POLICY AIMED AT REDUCING CHILD BLLS HAVE BEEN ENACTED, THE MOST NOTABLE BEING THE BAN OF LEAD-BASED PAINTS AND REMOVAL OF LEAD FROM GASOLINE.  STILL, PROMINENT SOURCES FOR LEAD EXPOSURE ARE STILL ACCESSIBLE, WITH SOME POPULATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AT A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RISK. ARIZONA HAS A NUMBER OF REGIONALLY-SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, INCLUDING LIVING IN PROXIMITY TO THE MEXICO-ARIZONA BORDER, MINING, AND RECENT IMMIGRATION STATUS. OTHER LEAD EXPOSURE SOURCES IDENTIFIED IN EBLL CASES IN ARIZONA INCLUDE CERAMIC POTTERY, MEXICAN CANDY, TRADITIONAL SPICES, FOLK MEDICINES, AND PARENTAL HOBBIES AND OCCUPATIONS. ON AVERAGE, 400 UNIQUE CHILDREN HAVE ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS EVERY YEAR.ARIZONA HAS LOW SCREENING RATES ACROSS THE STATE; ARIZONA ESTIMATED THAT 27.1% OF AT-RISK CHILDREN RECEIVED A BLOOD LEAD TEST AT 12 MONTHS OF AGE IN 2019. THERE IS ALSO A CONTINUED NEED TO IMPROVE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF LEAD-EXPOSED CHILDREN IN ARIZONA BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE STILL LEAD EXPOSED EVERY YEAR.

LABORATORIES AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REPORT ALL LEAD TEST RESULTS TO WI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES (DHS) UNDER STATE LAW. THE WI CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM (WCLPPP) HAS STRONG RELATIONS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING MEDICAID (MA), PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES INCLUDING WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) PROGRAMS AND HOUSING AGENCIES. WCLPPP UTILIZES DATA SO THAT ALL PARTIES CAN FOCUS ON DELIVERING TESTING, FOLLOW-UP AND PRIMARY PREVENTION SERVICES TO HIGH-RISK CHILDREN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO STRENGTHEN WI?S WELL ESTABLISHED SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. USING THE REFERENCE VALUE OF 5 MCG/DL HAS CREATED A STRONG CHALLENGE TO THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO BETTER PROTECT MORE CHILDREN FROM LEAD HAZARDS.  LEAD POISONING RATES IN WI CONTINUE TO EXCEED THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.  IN 2019 ALONE, 3,111 (3.73% OF CHILDREN TESTED) WI CHILDREN UNDER 6 YEARS OF AGE HAD BLOOD LEAD LEVELS (BLLS) >5 ?G/DL. MA CHILDREN ARE 2.3 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE LEAD-POISONED THAN CHILDREN NOT ENROLLED IN MA; MA CHILDREN CONSISTENTLY MAKE UP MORE THAN 80% OF ALL CONFIRMED LEAD POISONED CHILDREN IN WI. IN 2020, WHILE 60% OF CHILDREN TESTED STATEWIDE WERE ENROLLED IN MA, 80.5% CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MA WERE LEAD POISONED. MINORITY POPULATIONS SHARE A GREATER BURDEN OF THE LEAD POISONING PROBLEM. BLACK CHILDREN HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF LEAD POISONING. ALTHOUGH BLACK CHILDREN MADE UP ONLY 18.5% OF CHILDREN TESTED, BLACK CHILDREN MADE UP 45.3% OF ALL LEAD-POISONED CHILDREN. WCLPPP HAS ON-LINE ACCESS IN REAL TIME TO THE WISCONSIN MA ELIGIBILITY DATABASE. THIS ALLOWS STAFF TO ROUTINELY CONDUCT DATA MATCHES AND ANALYZE MA TESTING ON AN ?AS NEEDED? BASIS.  WCLPPP PARTNERS WITH MA AND WIC PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN WHO NEED TESTING AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING TO RAISE THE PERCENT OF MA CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE THE REQUIRED TESTS.

DESPITE THE RISK TO LEAD HAZARDS IN NEVADA, LESS THAN 4 PERCENT OF CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX ARE TESTED FOR LEAD AND EVEN FEWER SINCE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IN 2017 THE UNLV SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH REVITALIZED AND EXPANDED THE CLARK COUNTY CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM INTO THE FIRST STATEWIDE NEVADA CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM (NVCLPPP) BY IMPLEMENTING A FOUR-PRONGED APPROACH TO LEAD POISONING PREVENTION THAT ENGAGED HEALTH DISTRICTS, MEDICAL PROVIDERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALL TOWARD THE GOAL OF STRENGTHENING TESTING, REPORTING, SURVEILLANCE, AND PREVENTION. DURING THIS TIME, WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR ADVISORY BOARD, PASSED LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO IMPROVE REPORTING, IMPLEMENTED A NOVEL APPROACH TO ENGAGE PROVIDERS, INCREASED BLOOD LEAD TESTING, IMPROVED LINKAGES TO SERVICES, AND ENGAGED A DIVERSE SET OF STAKEHOLDERS IN LEAD POISONING PREVENTION AND EDUCATION. DESPITE THESE SUCCESSES, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HAMPERED PROGRESS ON ALL APPROACHES IMPLEMENTED AND HAS LEFT THE COMMUNITIES AT GREATEST RISK IN A MUCH MORE VULNERABLE POSITION.

THE PERCENT OF CHILDREN &LT;6 IN NC WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS =5 \u039cG/DL ON AT LEAST ONE BLOOD LEAD TEST DECREASED FROM 5.5% (N=41,127/754,562) IN 2006-2010 TO 1.4% (N=8,278/598,107) IN 2016-2019, SUGGESTING THAT THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY NC CLPPP ARE EFFECTIVELY REDUCING CHILDHOOD LEAD EXPOSURE. HOWEVER, 12 OF THE 100 NC COUNTIES HAD RATES OF CHILDREN WITH CONFIRMED EBLS =5 \u039cG/DL THAT WERE DOUBLE THE STATE RATE OR HIGHER DURING 2015-2019; AND 10 OF THOSE 12 WERE RURAL COUNTIES IN THE NORTHEAST AND EAST. BY WORKING WITH STRATEGIC COMMUNITY PARTNERS NC CLPPP WILL INCREASE INFORMATION DISSEMINATED TO THESE COUNTIES TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES.  WE AIM TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES OVER FIVE YEARS: COMPONENT A - IMPROVE BLOOD LEAD TESTING AND REPORTING RATES FOR CHILDREN &LT;6 YEARS OLD THROUGH PROVIDER AND LABORATORY OUTREACH - SUSTAIN AND DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENCIES THAT SERVE OUR TARGET POPULATIONS TO CREATE A STATEWIDE LEAD ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT ISSUES RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON LOCAL DATA - INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT LEAD-RELATED GUIDELINES AMONG PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS - ENHANCE THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM\u2019S ABILITY TO CAPTURE MISSING CHILD DEMOGRAPHIC AND FOLLOW-UP DATA BY MATCHING SURVEILLANCE DATA WITH MEDICAID DATA - IMPROVE THE RATE AT WHICH EBL CHILDREN &LT;6 YEARS ARE LINKED TO RECOMMENDED SERVICES - STRENGTHEN CLINICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CASE COORDINATION THROUGH SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS - REDUCE DISPARITIES IN BLOOD LEAD LEVELS BY RACE/ETHNICITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS BY TARGETING HIGH-RISK AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL NORTHEAST, FOR INTERVENTION AND OUTREACH COMPONENT B - INCREASE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING THROUGH COORDINATION WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL HEALTH AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS BY: O BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF EDUCATORS TO CONDUCT PRIMARY PREVENTION ACTIVITIES; O ENGAGING THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THROUGH OUTREACH TO RESIDENTS IN HIGH-RISK AREAS; O SHARING INFORMATION ON HEALTH DISPARITIES IN LEAD POISONING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH DECISION-MAKERS TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR PREVENTION OF LEAD POISONING IN CHILDREN; O CONDUCTING HOME ASSESSMENTS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL LEAD HAZARDS IN HOMES; O COLLABORATING WITH THE STATE\u2019S RRP PROGRAM TO TRAIN PROFESSIONALS TO BUILD CAPACITY WITHIN THE COUNTY AND REGION TO IMPLEMENT LEAD-SAFE WORK PRACTICES;  FOR OVER 20 YEARS, NC CLPPP HAS BUILT MEANINGFUL PARTNERSHIPS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS, DEVELOPING SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES AND BUILDING CAPACITY TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF LEAD POISONING IN NORTH CAROLINA.

THIS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED RISK OF LEAD-EXPOSURE AND ASSOCIATED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN CHILDREN UNDER SIX YEARS OLD.  FURTHER COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM, IS THE FACT THAT AN EVEN LARGER PROPORTION OF THE OLDER HOUSING STOCK EXISTS IN DENSELY POPULATED CITIES WHERE CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN POVERTY AND MORE LIKELY TO BE BLACK OR HISPANIC, WIDENING THE HEALTH DISPARITY GAP. OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, CONNECTICUT HAS SEEN A STEADY DECLINE OF ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS (?5 MCG/DL) IN CHILDREN UNDER SIX YEARS OLD.  THIS STEADY DECLINE HAS BEEN, IN LARGE PART, DUE TO THE CONSISTENT SUPPORT RECEIVED BY THE CDC AS WELL AS THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH?S CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM?S (CLPPP) ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY AND SUSTAINED ENGAGEMENT WITH FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL PARTNERS.PURPOSE: THE CLPPP IS INTENT ON ELIMINATING CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING BY: 1) ENSURING BLOOD LEAD TESTING AND REPORTING, 2) ENHANCING BLOOD LEAD SURVEILLANCE, 3) IMPROVING LINKAGES TO ENSURE LEAD-EXPOSED CHILDREN RECEIVE RECOMMENDED SERVICES, AND 4) DEVELOPING TARGETED POPULATION-BASED INTERVENTIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO SEEK GRANT FUNDING TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN THESE GOALS.STRATEGIES AND OUTCOMES: THROUGH CDC FUNDING WE EXPECT TO ENSURE BLOOD LEAD TESTING AND REPORTING BY INCREASING COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND STAKEHOLDERS, ADDRESS OUTDATED LEGISLATION, AND INCREASE PROVIDER COMPLIANCE SCREENING AND REPORTING LAWS. THE CLPPP WILL ALSO ENHANCE BLOOD LEAD SURVEILLANCE BY IMPROVING COMPLETENESS OF DATA COLLECTION, INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF DATA PROCESSING, EMPLOYING DATA MATCHING METHODS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND SCREENING RATES IN MEDICAID AND REFUGEE POPULATIONS, AND BY PUBL ISHING SURVEILLANCE REPORTS MAKING DATA PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FOR USE BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (LHDS).  WE WILL IMPROVE LINKAGES OF LEAD-EXPOSED CHILDREN TO RECOMMENDED SERVICES BY CREATING LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES LHDS TO UTILIZE THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM AND BY ENSURING LHDS CONDUCT TIMELY ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS WHILE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE CLPPP WILL ALSO COLLABORATE WITH THE OFFICE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD?S BIRTH TO THREE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO LEAD POISONED CHILDREN AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH REGIONAL LEAD TREATMENT CENTERS TO PROVIDE PEER TO PEER EDUCATION AND RESOURCES FOR CASE MANAGEMENT. FINALLY, THE CLPPP WILL STRENGTHEN TARGETED POPULATION-BASED INTERVENTIONS AND ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES BY UTILIZING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO MAP AND ENHANCE KNOWLEDGE OF LOCATIONS WITH HIGH PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE OF LEAD POISONING.

OVER 54% OF HAWAII?S HOUSING AND 61% OF HONOLULU?S HOUSING WERE BUILT BEFORE 1980. HAWAII?S WARM AND HUMID TROPICAL CLIMATE CREATES A CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT ACCELERATES PAINT DETERIORATION. HAWAII ALSO HAS THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY COMBINED WITH MODERATE SALARIES AND A VERY COMPETITIVE RENTAL MARKET. THESE FACTORS PREVENT MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO OWN FROM PROPERLY MAINTAINING THEIR HOMES, WHILE RENTERS OFTEN AVOID ASKING THEIR LANDLORDS FOR REPAIRS FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN NOTICE TO MOVE OUT. HAWAII ALSO CONTINUES TO WELCOME A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS FROM COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE ASIA PACIFIC RIM, CREATING LARGE POPULATIONS OF NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING GROUPS THAT OFTEN LIVE IN MULTI-FAMILY HOMES WITHIN AREAS ALREADY AFFECTED BY TRADITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES, INCLUDING HIGHER RATES OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING. LEAD SOURCES AND DATA: RECENT LEAD ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS IDENTIFIED LIKELY SOURCES OF LEAD EXPOSURE FOR CHILDREN AS LEAD-BASED PAINT, HOME SMELTING OF FISHING SINKERS, CONTAMINATED SOIL, SOUVENIR MAGNETS, SALVAGED WOOD, USED FURNITURE, CERAMIC TILES, ANTIQUE JARS, DISHES, BEACH DEBRIS, OLD TOYS, AND OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE. HAWAII?S STATEWIDE E BLL RATE IN 2020 WAS 1.09%, BUT A NEIGHBOR ISLAND LIKE HAWAII ISLAND HAD HIGHER EBLL RATES (2.47%). THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN TESTED FOR BLOOD LEAD DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY (19.1%) IN 2020 DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT (25.0%) OF ALL 1- AND 2-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN WERE TESTED FOR BLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN 2020 (UP FROM A 23.8% BASELINE IN 2017, BUT DOWN FROM THE PEAK OF 26.7% IN 2018).

MOST OF THESE HOMES ARE IN RURAL AREAS OF THE REGION AND ARE OCCUPIED BY OUR TARGET POPULATIONS. THE TARGET POPULATIONS FOR THE GLOW CLPP PROGRAM ARE CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX (WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON CHILDREN UNDER THREE YEARS OLD) FROM LOW-INCOME, MIGRANT, NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING, NATIVE AMERICAN, AMISH, AND OTHER ETHNIC MINORITY FAMILIES.

IN 2019, 89,858 MINNESOTA CHILDREN AGED < 6 YEARS WERE BLOOD LEAD TESTED. AMONG THESE, 608 (0.68%) HAD A CONFIRMED ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVEL (EBLL). WHILE THE PREVALENCE OF EBLLS IN MINNESOTA CHILDREN HAS DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PAST DECADES, THE PREVALENCE OF EBLLS IS NOT EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THERE ARE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND POPULATIONS WITH PREVALENCES MUCH HIGHER THAN THE STATE PREVALENCE. THESE AREAS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF POVERTY, OLDER HOUSING STOCK, AND LARGER PROPORTIONS OF PERSONS OF COLOR. MCLPPP IS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THESE DISPARITIES THROUGH TARGETING INTERVENTIONS TO HIGH-RISK AREAS AND POPULATIONS. THE MCLPPP HAS OPERATED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE 1995 IN ITS EFFORTS TO MONITOR AND ELIMINATE LEAD EXPOSURE IN MINNESOTA. IT IS AUTHORIZED UNDER MINNESOTA STATUES TO MAINTAIN A STATEWIDE LEAD SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM INFORMS AUTHORIZED AGENCIES (MDH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH BOARDS) OF LEAD EXPOSED CASES SO THAT THE FAMILY CAN BE REACHED WITH EDUCATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENTS. THESE AGENCIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE ENFORCEABLE CORRECTION ORDERS FOR IDENTIFIED LEAD HAZARDS. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE UPON AND CONTINUE THE OPERATION OF THE MCLPPP, FUNDS RECEIVED THROUGH THIS GRANT WILL SUPPORT ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE LEAD EXPOSURES AND LEAD POISONING IN MINNESOTA. ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: SCREENING, REPORTING OF BLOOD LEAD DATA TO CDC, DATA MANAGEMENT/SURVEILLANCE, AND TARGETED POPULATION-BASED INTERVENTIONS.

MORE CHILDREN WERE TESTED AT 12 AND 24 MONTHS, BUT OF THE 24,153 OF THESE MEDICAID ELIGIBLE CHILDREN, ONLY 42.7% WERE TESTED, LEAVING 57.3% THAT WERE NOT TESTED. HOMEOWNERSHIP IN WEST VIRGINIA BETWEEN 2015-2019 WAS 73.4% WHILE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS 64.1 % AS OF JANUARY 2020. MANY WEST VIRGINIANS PASS THE FAMILY HOMESTEAD DOWN THROUGH GENERATIONS TO THEIR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN. PER THE U.S. CENSUS, OF ALL WEST VIRGINIA OCCUPIED UNITS, 59.3% WERE BUILT BEFORE 1980. OF THE HOMES BUILT BEFORE 1980, 73.4% ARE OWNER OCCUPIED AND 26.6% ARE RENTER OCCUPIED. POPULATION ESTIMATES FOR 2019 FROM THE UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU (CENSUS.GOV/QUICKFACTS/WV) REPORTED THAT 93.5% OF WEST VIRGINIA RESIDENTS ARE CAUCASIAN, 3.6% BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN, 0.3% AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE, 0.8% ASIAN, 1.89% OTHER. 1.7% OF WEST VIRGINIANS ARE OF HISPANIC AND LATINO ETHNIC ORIGIN.

TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE 91,589 WEST VIRGINIA CHILDREN, UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE, LIVE IN POVERTY. SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF ALL WEST VIRGINIANS LIVE IN POVERTY. APPROXIMATELY 54% OF WEST VIRGINIA BIRTHS WERE PAID FOR BY MEDICAID. WHILE BOTH CAUCASIANS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE POVERTY RATES ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, DISPARITIES EXIST ACROSS ALL AGE GROUPS. OVERALL, 29.6% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE IN POVERTY COMPARED TO 17.05% OF CAUCASIANS.

DESPITE THESE IMPORTANT GAINS, NYS CONTINUES TO HAVE THE GREATEST NUMBER OF CASES OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING IN THE NATION. FROM 2016 THROUGH 2019, BLOOD LEAD TESTS IN NYS IDENTIFIED AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 13,893 CHILDREN UNDER AGE SIX WITH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS (BLLS) AT OR ABOVE THE CDC REFERENCE VALUE OF 5?G/DL, A RATE OF 16.5 PER 1000 TESTED STATEWIDE (INCLUDING ALL TEST TYPES).

EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE SOCIETAL COSTS OF LEAD POISONING ON LIFETIME EARNINGS, TAX REVENUE, EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM GREATLY OUTWEIGH THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REMEDIATING LEAD POISONING HAZARDS.

KANSAS HAS AREAS WITH HISTORICAL LEAD CONTAMINATION FROM INDUSTRY AND MINING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS CURRENT INDUSTRIES WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR ADULTS TO BRING LEAD CONTAMINATION INTO THE HOME. THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN UNDER AGE 6 YEARS THAT WERE TESTED FOR BLOOD LEAD PEAKED IN 2011 WITH 34,621 INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN TESTED. ACCORDING TO DATA SUBMITTED TO THE CDC, 28,079 CHILDREN WERE TESTED IN 2019.  ACCORDING TO THE INTERCENSAL POPULATION ESTIMATES, THE POPULATION OF 0 TO < 6 AGED CHILDREN IN KANSAS HAS DECREASED BY ABOUT 11,000 FROM 2014 TO 2018. WHEN CONTRASTING TWO YEARS, STATEWIDE THERE WERE 406 CHILDREN IN 2014 AND 472 CHILDREN IN 2019, AND 243 CHILDREN IN 2020 BETWEEN 0 AND LESS THAN 6 YEARS WITH CONFIRMED LEVELS OF 5 UG/DL AND GREATER. THE HIGHER POPULATED COUNTIES OF SEDGWICK, SHAWNEE, AND WYANDOTTE HAD 162 CASES (39.9%) IN 2014 AND 161 CASES (34.1%) IN 2019 BETWEEN THEM.  TWO ADDITIONAL COUNTIES, MONTGOMERY WITH COUNTY-WIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM AN OLD ZINC SMELTING SITE AND SALINE WITH A MAJOR BATTERY MANUFACTURING PLANT WITH HISTORICAL VIOLATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARD FOR LEAD, HAD AN ADDITIONAL 26 CASES (6.4%) IN 2014 AND 43 CASES (9.3%) IN 2019 BETWEEN THEM.  OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS, TYPICALLY LESS THAN 15% OF CHILDREN ARE SCREENED FOR BLOOD LEAD EACH YEAR LEAVING MUCH UNKNOWN ABOUT THE TRUE BURDEN OF BLOOD LEAD POISO NING IN THE STATE. THE PERCENT OF MEDICAID ENROLLED CHILDREN UNDER 6 YEARS OF AGE THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR BLOOD LEAD WAS HIGHEST IN 2011 AT APPROXIMATELY 17.4% AND WAS NOT TRACKED FOR SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES AGAIN UNTIL FUNDING RESUMED IN 2018.

STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES ARE OUTLINED IN THE APPLICATION TO FURTHER EVALUATE BARRIERS ASSOCIATED WITH TESTING AND IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO ADDRESS THE MOST COMMONLY CITED ISSUES TO INCREASE TESTING RATES AMONG AT-RISK CHILDREN STATEWIDE.   FUNDING FROM THIS COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT THE 3 MAIN CORE COMPONENTS OUTLINED IN THE NOTICE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY WHICH ARE; ENSURING BLOOD LEAD TESTING AND REPORTING, ENHANCING BLOOD LEAD SURVEILLANCE, AND IMPROVING LINKAGES OF LEAD-EXPOSED CHILDREN TO RECOMMENDED SERVICES. THE OVERALL PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE CHILDHOOD LEAD EXPOSURE AND POISONING IN KANSAS THROUGH SECONDARY PREVENTION STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN LESS THAN 6 YEARS OLD TESTED FOR BLOOD LEAD, CONDUCTING BLOOD LEAD SURVEILLANCE TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS, IMPROVED DATA LINKAGE AND DATA USAGE BETWEEN PARTNERS, AND INCREASING IDENTIFICATION OF LEAD EXPOSED CHILDREN LINKED TO RECOMMENDED SERVICES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of
