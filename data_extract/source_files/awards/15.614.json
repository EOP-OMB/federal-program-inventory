A CORE STRENGTH OF THE PROJECT IS ITS OUTSTANDING WETLAND VALUES AND IMPORTANCE AS A MARSH MIGRATION SITE.

THE PROJECT WILL ALSO PROVIDE COASTAL MIGRATION SPACE FOR EXPANSION TO OVER 34 SALT MARSH ACRES UNDER A 6.1 FOOT SEA LEVEL RISE SCENARIO, ACCORDING TO MODELING BY THE MAINE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.

IN FACT, AN EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION DUE TO THE DEER OVERPOPULATION HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE YEAR FOR  THIS ISLAND. THE RESERVE CONTAINS BIODIVERSE SAND DUNES THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT SEABIRD NESTING AREAS, BUT REMAINING NATIVE PLANTS ARE BEING BROWSED TO THE GROUND, AND SEABIRD NESTS ARE BEING CRUSHED BY DEER OR PREYED UPON BY CATS. INTERTIDAL AREAS IN THE RESERVE ARE IMPORTANT RESTING AND PUPPING AREAS FOR CRITICALLY ENDANGERED HAWAIIAN MONK SEALS (MONACHUS SCHAUINSLANDI), AND USED BY GREEN SEA TURTLES (CHELONIA MYDAS) FOR HAULING AND RESTING. LARGE PREDATORS SUCH AS CATS AND DOGS DISTURB THESE ANIMALS AND SPREAD LETHAL DISEASES SUCH AS TOXOPLASMOSIS. IN ADJACENT AREAS, PREDATOR PROOF FENCES ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED TO COMBAT THESE THREATS. THE SUCCESS OF THESE OTHER RESTORATION AREAS OF NORTHWESTERN MOLOKAI HAS DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY FOR THE WINDSWEPT COASTAL NATIVE VEGETATION TO RECOVER AND ATTRACT SEABIRD NESTING COLONIES. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO CONSTRUCT A FENCE AT ILIO THAT WILL PROTECT THIS AREA FROM DEER AND LARGE PREDATORS. ILIO IS STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT DUE TO ITS TOPOGRAPHY THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO FENCING, PRESENCE OF ENDANGERED SPECIES, AND LARGE EXPANSES OF RARE COASTAL SAND DUNES. ILIO WILL BE A KEY ADDITION TO A NETWORK OF COASTAL RESTORATION SITES, AND STRENGTHEN THE ENTIRE NETWORK BY CREATING A LARGER, MORE DEFENSIBLE, PROTECTED AREA THAT CAN ATTRACT MORE SEABIRDS, AND SERVE AS ANOTHER OUTPLANTING SITE. MATCHING FUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED TO PROTECT THE NEARBY MOOMOMI PRESERVE, THE OTHER LARGE EXPANSE OF COASTAL SAND DUNES IN THIS REGION AND A SITE WHERE AN EXISTING FENCE IS DEMONSTRATING RESTORATION POTENTIAL. THIS PROPOSED ILIO PROJECT WOULD EXPAND A PROMISING COASTAL PARTNERSHIP INCLUDING STATE OWNED ILIO POINT AND THE ADJACENT PRIVATELY OWNED PRESERVES. WHILE ILIO HAS LARGELY BEEN NEGLECTED, THAT TREND CAN BE REVERSED BY BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF DECADES OF PROTECTION AT THE NEIGHBORING PRESERVES.  OBJECTIVES  EXCLUDE INVASIVE FERAL LARGE PREDATORS (CATS AND DOGS) AND DEER BY CONSTRUCTING A FENCE AND REMOVING THESE ANIMALS IN THE 190 AC FENCE UNIT.

RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT WILL INCLUDE: TOPSOIL GRADING, SEEDING, PLANTING, SOIL AMENDMENT (COMPOST ADDITION), AND TEMPORARY IRRIGATION; SEVERAL ROUNDS OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TO EXHAUST THE TOPSOIL'S INVASIVE SEED BANK' REVEGETATION AND ENHANCEMENT WORK TO ESTABLISH AREAS OF WILLOW SAUSAL OR WILLOW THICKET, MIXED RIPARIAN FOREST, OAKS SAVANNA, SEASONAL WETLANDS, AND NATIVE GRASSLANDS; PLANT APPROXIMATELY 8,000 - 10,000 NATIVE TREES AND SHRUBS; AND REMOVAL OF A DILAPIDATED BUILDING AND THE ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE. THE EARTHWORK AT THE SITE INCLUDES CREATING SHALLOW DEPRESSIONS TO ESTABLISH SEASONAL WETLANDS-WITH EITHER SHALLOW EXCAVATIONS (~1-2 FEET) BELOW CURRENT GRADES/ELEVATIONS OR IMPORTING CLEAN SOIL TO CAP OVER EXISTING GRADES - TO ESTABLISH A MORE COMPLEX TOPOGRAPHY AND SUPPORT WETLAND CREATION. THE GRASSLAND AND OAK SAVANNA AREAS CONSIDERED TOO DRY FOR RIPARIAN RESTORATION WILL BE MOWED OR GRAZED FOR FIRE MANAGEMENT, WEED CONTROL, AND AGRICULTURE.

THE PROPERTY CONSISTS OF OVER 400 ACRES OF UNDEVELOPED LAND BETWEEN NEWPORT BEACH AND COSTA MESA WITH A BIOLOGICALLY DIVERSE MIX OF COASTAL WETLANDS, RIPARIAN WOODLANDS, COASTAL BLUFF SAGESCRUB, GRASSLAND, VERNAL POOLS, AND RARE SPECIES HABITAT. THE PROJECT OFFERS AN IRREPLACEABLE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT IN PERPETUITY 44 ACRES OF COASTAL WETLANDS AND ASSOCIATED UPLANDS ON THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST. THE OVERALL PROJECT INVOLVES FEE TITLE PURCHASE OF 384 ACRES TO PREVENT HIGH-DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE PROPERTY, PROTECT ONE OF THE LARGEST UNPROTECTED WETLAND COMPLEXES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, AND RETAIN THE SITE'S CURRENT ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION. THE OVERALL ACQUISITION WILL OCCUR THROUGH A SINGLE TRANSACTION, BUT A SUBSET OF THE PROPERTY IS DEFINED AS THE NCWC PROJECT (\"THE NCWC PROJECT AREA\") FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PROPOSAL. IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DEFINE THE NCWC PROJECT AREA BASED ON PARCEL BOUNDARIES DUE TO THE SIZE AND VALUE OF THE PARCELS AND NCWC PROJECT COST CONSTRAINTS. THE 44.1-ACRE BANNING RANCH NCWC PROJECT AREA CONSISTS OF A PORTION OF THE OVERALL PROJECT AREA ADJACENT TO THE SANTA ANA (SA) RIVER MARSH AND IS BOUNDED BY ACCESS ROADS. THE NCWC PROJECT AREA CONTAINS 31.4 ACRES OF WETLANDS, OF WHICH 99% ARE NATIONALLY DECLINING TYPES, AND 12.7 ACRES OF UPLANDS. IT HAS HIGH POTENTIAL FOR CONNECTION TO THE SA RIVER MARSH TO FACILITATE TIDAL MARSH RESTORATION. THIS ACQUISITION IS A CRITICAL STEP IN FUTURE RESTORATION OF THE DIVERSE HABITATS ON THE PROPERTY.

TODAY, THE ORANGE COUNTY PORTION OF THE SA RIVER FLOWS THROUGH A CONCRETE BOX CULVERT AND FUNCTIONS ONLY AS A FLOOD DRAINAGE CHANNEL. THE REMNANTS OF THE ESTUARY ARE THE HUNTINGTON BEACH WETLANDS, NORTH OF THE SA RIVER AND PROTECTED IN PART BY A 2017 NCWC GRANT, AND THE SANTA ANA WETLANDS, SOUTH OF THE SA RIVER AND INCLUDING THE PROJECT AREA AS THE LAST UNPROTECTED REMNANT. THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WETLANDS RECOVERY PROJECT (SCWRP) SET THE GOAL OF RECONNECTING THESE WETLANDS, UNITING THE SA RIVER ESTUARY FRAGMENTS INTO ONE RESTORATION PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT UNIT.
