THIS GRANT PROJECT WILL EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND POTENTIAL PROFITABILITY TO FARMER-MEMBERS OF FORMING AN AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE TO MEET THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY. SERVING IN THE VITAL ROLE AS MID-TIER VALUE- ADDED AGGREGATOR,M3 COOP WILL CATALYZE THE EVOLUTION OF THE MID-ATLANTIC FOOD SYSTEM AND INCREASE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF SMALL DAIRY AND LIVESTOCK FARMING IN THE REGION WHILE INCREASING THE RESILIENCE OF THE REGIONAL FOOD SYSTEM. THIS PROJECT WILL ALLOW THE NASCENT M3 COOP TO HIRE A PROJECT DIRECTOR TO BRING FARMERS INTO THE COOP,BUILD THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE,AND ESTABLISH PROTOCOLS AND ESSENTIAL FOOD-CHAIN RELATIONSHIPS.
