IN 2017, THESE DISEASES ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 50% OF ALL DEATHS IN GUAM. IN THE SAME YEAR, CANCER CONTINUES TO BE THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN GUAM MAKING IT ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE HEALTH BURDENS IN OUR COMMUNITY. ACCORDING TO THE GUAM CANCER FACT AND FIGURES 2008-2012, ON AVERAGE, 1 GUAMANIAN IS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER EACH DAY, WHILE 1 GUAMANIAN DIES OF CANCER EVERY 2.5 DAYS. DATA INDICATE THAT THE CANCER BURDEN IN GUAM IS RISING. BOTH CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY HAVE INCREASED OVER THREE TIME PERIODS (1998-2002, 2003- 2007, AND 2008- 2012).  THERE WERE 298 NEW CASES OF BREAST CANCER AND 130 NEW CANCER CASES OF CERVICAL CANCER IN GUAM, ACCORDING TO THE GUAM CANCER FACTS AND FIGURE 2008-2012. THE BURDEN OF CANCER IS AGGRAVATED BY CHALLENGES SUCH AS LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS AND THE HIGH COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OFF-ISLAND CARE.  AS BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER ARE THE SECOND AND FIFTH LEADING CAUSES OF CANCER-ASSOCIATED DEATHS IN GUAM RESPECTIVELY, THE NEED FOR EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER IS A RECOGNIZED PRIMARY NECESSITY ON ISLAND. AS AN EMERGENT PROBLEM AMONG WOMEN 25 YEARS AND OLDER, THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO HAVE SUCCUMBED TO BREAST CANCER AND CERVICAL IS STEADILY INCREASING.  THE PURPOSE OF THE GUAM BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER EARLY DETECTION PROGRAM (GBCCEDP) IS TO ENHANCE EXISTING SYSTEMS FOR BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING, FOLLOW-UP, AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE HIGH INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY RATES, AND LATE-STAGE DIAGNOSIS.  THIS WILL BE DONE BY PROVIDING ACCESSIBLE AND TIMELY SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES TO INCLUDE CASE MANAGEMENT FOR FOLLOW-UP OF ABNORMAL RESULTS; TREATMENT REFERRAL FOR WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER; COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP; COLLECTION AND SURVEILLANCE OF POPULATION-LEVEL DATA FOR DECISION MAKING; COMMUNITY CLINICAL LINKAGE TO AID PATIENT SUPPORT AND ADDRESS SOCIAL HEALTH DETERMINANTS; AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH SYSTEMS EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS.

GCCCP AIMS TO MAXIMIZE AND LEVERAGE LIMITED RESOURCES AND INCREASE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT BY ELIMINATING DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS, STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS, AND IMPLEMENTING EVIDENCED BASED STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTIONS.  THE CANCER BURDEN DESCRIBED IS TRULY A PRESSING HEALTH ISSUE THAT MUST BE SYSTEMATICALLY ADDRESSED.  THE CONTINUATION OF BOTH THE GBCCEDP AND GCCCP THROUGH THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITY IS SIGNIFICANT DUE TO INCREASING NEW CANCER CASES, INCREASING CANCER MORTALITY RATES, INCREASING RATES OF CO-MORBID RISK FACTORS SUCH AS OBESITY, AND POOR CANCER SCREENING RATES.

TWO DECADES WORTH OF COORDINATED AND COLLABORATIVE EARLY DETECTION AND CANCER CONTROL EFFORTS HAVE LED TO DOWNWARD TRENDS IN ALL-SITE CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY AND HAS ENHANCED THE LIVELIHOODS OF INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY CANCER. HOWEVER, IMPORTANT HEALTH DISPARITIES REMAIN. AS EXAMPLES, FROM 2013-17, 36% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER WERE REGIONAL OR DISTANT STAGE COMPARED TO 28% OF CAUCASIAN WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN IN DELAWARE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH AND TO DIE FROM PROSTATE CANCER. FROM 2003-07 TO 2013-17, DELAWARE\u2019S ALL-SITE CANCER MORTALITY RATE INCREASED 18% AMONG HISPANIC MALES.

THE GOAL IS TO DECREASE CANCER INCIDENCE, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. THE CTCCCP WILL FOCUS ON UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS WITH INCREASED CANCER RISK DUE TO HEALTH DISPARITIES. CTCCCP WILL LEVERAGE ITS MULTI-SECTORAL CTCCCP COALITION, HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE COALITION, AND TWO SUBCOMMITTEES TO ENHANCE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER LOCAL, COMMUNITY, AND GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPROVE THE USE OF SCARCE RESOURCES AND INCREASE COLLABORATIONS AMONG ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED WITH AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKA NATIVE (AIANS) AND CANCER PROGRAMS. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY CONTINUING AND ESTABLISHING NEW COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH 20 SUBAWARDEES, THE COALITION MEMBERS, OTHER STATE CANCER PROGRAMS, AND LOCAL,STATE, AND NATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS. THROUGH THE 20 SUBAWARDS, CRIHB WILL ASSIST UP TO 63 TRIBES AND THEIR THPS TO DEVELOP, PLAN, IMPLEMENT, AND EVALUATE PROJECTS THAT FOCUS ON THE FIVE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CONTROL PROGRAM (NCCCP) GRANT STRATEGIES TO MEET THE SHORT, INTERMEDIATE, AND LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. THPS AND COALITION MEMBERS WILL AIM TO IMPROVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CANCER CARE THROUGH PRIMARY PREVENTION, EARLY SCREENING AND DETECTION, AND THE PROMOTION OF CANCER SURVIVORSHIP CARE SERVICES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. CRIHB WILL IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE THE PROGRESS OF THE EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES OVER FIVE YEARS. THE AIM IS TO ASSESS THE INTERVENTIONS' IMPACT TO DECREASE THE MORTALITY, INCIDENCE, AND RISK OF THE TOP FIVE CANCERS, INCLUDING DETERMINANTS TO REDUCE BREAST CANCER, PROSTATE CANCER, AND LIVER CANCER. ADDITIONALLY, IT AIMS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF INTERVENTIONS IN INCREASING HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION RATES AMONG AIAN YOUTH, DECREASING ALCOHOL INTAKE, AND INCREASING CANCER SURVIVORSHIP SERVICE DELIVERY AMONG RURAL AIANS. CTCCCP HAS DEVELOPED AN EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PLAN THAT WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN TRACKING PROGRESS AND MEASURING OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES AT THE OVERALL PROGRAM AND SITE-SPECIFIC LEVELS. THE EVALUATION WILL ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH ACTIVITIES AND STRATEGIES ARE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED, DEMONSTRATE WHETHER ACTIONS LED TO EXPECTED OUTPUTS AND THE PROJECTED OUTCOMES, AND INFORM PROGRAM PLANNING, DECISION MAKING, AND CONTINUOUS PROGRAM QUALITY IMPROVEMENT.

OF THOSE UNINSURED, 11.8% ARE PROGRAM ELIGIBLE (63,835 WOMEN, AGE 21 OR OLDER, AT OR BELOW 250% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL) AND PRIORITIZED AS THE TARGET POPULATION.  IN THIS PROJECT PERIOD, THE KENTUCKY WOMEN\u2019S CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM) PROPOSES TO PROVIDE 3500 BREAST AND/OR CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING AND LOW-COST DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES TO THE TARGET POPULATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. STATE DATA FROM 2014-2018 FROM THE KENTUCKY CANCER REGISTRY AND UNITED STATES CANCER STATISTICS, SHOW THAT KENTUCKY HAS A CANCER PROBLEM.  THE INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY RATES FOR BOTH BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCERS ARE HIGHER IN KENTUCKY THAN THE US. IN FACT, KENTUCKY HAS THE HIGHEST CERVICAL CANCER INCIDENCE RATE IN THE COUNTRY FOR 2014-2018. KENTUCKY\u2019S BREAST CANCER SCREENING IS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE US, AND IN 2020, 70.5% OF KENTUCKY WOMEN AGE 40 AND ABOVE HAD A MAMMOGRAM WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS, COMPARED TO 71.5% IN THE US.  KENTUCKY\u2019S CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RATES ARE THE SAME AS THE US (80.5%, 2020).   IN ADDITION TO THE STATISTICS, THE STATE IS BURDENED BY BARRIERS RELATED TO GEOGRAPHY, POVERTY, TRANSPORTATION, ACCESS TO CARE, FATALISM, AND PROVIDER FEAR AND DISTRUST, RESULTING IN DISPARITIES IN CANCER OUTCOMES ESPECIALLY AMONG BLACK WOMEN; HISPANIC WOMEN; LOW-INCOME, UNINSURED, OR UNDERINSURED WOMEN; AND WOMEN LIVING IN RURAL APPALACHIA. THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE LARGE MINORITY POPULATIONS IN THE RURAL REGIONS, BUT URBAN AREAS HAVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF BLACK POPULATIONS, AND A GROWING HISPANIC POPULATION. TO MAXIMIZE EFFORTS TO REACH AND INCREASE BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RATES THE PROGRAM UTILIZED A DATA-DRIVEN, EQUITY-DRIVEN, COLLABORATIVE-DRIVEN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY FOCUS AREAS, DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER, AREAS KNOWN AS POPULATION(S) OF FOCUS.  PRELIMINARY ANALYSES INCLUDED PROGRAM DATA, UNINSURE D AND INCOME DATA (SMALL AREA HEALTH INSURANCE ESTIMATES), CANCER INCIDENCE, MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY DATA FROM THE KENTUCKY CANCER REGISTRY, AND THE KENTUCKY COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CONTROL PROGRAM DATA (KENTUCKY\u2019S CANCER ACTION PLAN, KENTUCKY\u2019S CANCER NEEDS ASSESSMENT).  IN ADDITION, THE STATE\u2019S BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM DATA, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH DATA AND THE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX WERE UTILIZED BOTH FOR COMMUNITY OUTREACH PLANNING STRATEGIES AND DECISION-MAKING.  COLLABORATION WITH OTHER CDC-FUNDED PROGRAMS IS ESSENTIAL TO AMPLIFY EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE HIGH BURDEN OF CANCER IN THE STATE. THE PROGRAM WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE KENTUCKY CANCER REGISTRY, WHICH PROVIDES COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY CANCER DATA TO SUPPORT EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTION PLANNING, AS WELL IDENTIFYING AREAS THAT MOST NEED BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING AND REPORTING THE NUMBER OF NEW BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER CASES IDENTIFIED.  ANOTHER MAJOR PARTNER, THE KENTUCKY COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CONTROL PROGRAM, WHICH LEADS THE KENTUCKY CANCER ACTION PLAN AND THE KENTUCKY CANCER CONSORTIUM, IS THE STATEWIDE CANCER CONTROL COALITION, COMPRISED OF MORE THAN 100 MULTI-SECTORAL ORGANIZATIONS AND MEMBERS OF CANCER BURDENED POPULATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH, AND TO COMBAT THE STATE\u2019S CANCER PROBLEMS, THE PROGRAM IS BUILDING A SOLID INFRASTRUCTURE (SCREENING DELIVERY SYSTEMS) AND STRONG HUMAN CAPACITY (RETAIN EXPERIENCED STAFF AND PARTNERS) TO IMPLEMENT AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THAT ENSURES WOMEN ARE EMPOWERED BY HAVING INCREASED ACCESS TO CANCER CONTROL COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, SOCIAL SERVICES, QUALITY BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING, TIMELY FOLLOW-UP TO DIAGNOSTICS AND TREATMENT, ALL WITH AN OVERARCHING HEALTH EQUITY COMPONENT.

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS (NATIONAL) IS APPLYING FOR PROGRAM 2 OF THE FOA (CDC-RFA-DP17-1701), THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CONTROL PROGRAM (NCCCP) AND IS ALSO APPLYING ON BEHALF OF THE FOUR STATES OF FSM.

FSM NOW HAS CANCER REGISTRIES IN ALL THE FOUR STATES INCLUDING THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THAT ARE LINKED TO THE PACIFIC REGIONAL CENTRAL CANCER REGISTRY. ANOTHER MILESTONE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL STANDARDS OF CARE GUIDELINES FOR BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER WHICH WAS REVISED AND UPDATED IN 2015. THESE NATIONAL GUIDELINES ARE USED TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRAINING MODULES ON CANCER PREVENTION, EARLY DETECTION, PALLIATIVE CARE AND SURVIVORSHIP.
