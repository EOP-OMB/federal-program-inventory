BEACH COUNTY SHERIFF\u0092S OFFICE CRIME LABORATORY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANALYZING EVIDENTIARY MATERIAL ASSOCIATED WITH CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS FOR OVER 28 MUNICIPALITIES, THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND LOCAL FEDERAL AGENCIES AS NEEDED.  AS THE PRIMARY AGENCY CONDUCTING DNA ANALYSIS FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT THE FBU PROVIDE EFFICIENT AND TIMELY PROCESSING OF ALL EVIDENCE.  IN MARCH OF 2016 FLORIDA SENATE BILL 636 WAS PASSED INTO LAW REQUIRING THE TESTING OF ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS WITHIN 120 DAYS OF SUBMISSION TO THE LABORATORY.  \n\nSINCE ITS ENACTMENT THE FBU HAS EXPERIENCED:\n\n\u0095\tA 58% INCREASE IN SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE REQUESTS\n\u0095\tA 40% INCREASE IN SCREENING SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE \n\u0095\tA 52% INCREASE IN SEXUAL ASSAULT AUTOSOMAL DNA ANALYSIS\n\u0095\tA 70% INCREASE IN Y-STR DNA ANALYSIS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE\n\nIN ORDER TO ADDRESS THESE INCREASES THE FBU IS PROPOSING TO AGAIN OBTAIN FUNDING FOR TWO FULL-TIME FORENSIC SCIENTISTS THROUGH THE CEBR PROGRAM WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE THE HANDLING, SCREENING AND COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE FOR DOWNSTREAM DNA ANALYSIS.  IN ADDITION, THE FBU WOULD ALSO CONTRACT WITH MARSHALL UNIVERSITY FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM INTERN.  THE INTERN, WHO WILL BE PREPARED IN FBU METHODOLOGIES PRIOR TO THE INTERNSHIP, WILL COMPLETE A LABORATORY DIRECTED VALIDATION PROJECT.\n\nTHE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DECREASE THE EXISTING TURNAROUND TIMES THAT THE LABORATORY HAD ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF SB 636.  THE CITIZENS OF PALM BEACH COUNTY HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDED WITH FULLY VALIDATED TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODOLOGIES IN FORENSIC DNA ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST QUALITY CASEWORK AND PREVENT FUTURE DNA BACKLOGS.  THE FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THIS AWARD WILL HELP THE LABORATORY INCREASE CAPACITY AS WELL AS IMPLEMENT A MORE STREAMLINED WORKFLOW THROUGH ADDITIONAL VALIDATION WORK.  AS A RESULT OF FUNDING FROM THIS GRANT THE PBSO FBU EXPECTS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ITS QUEST TO REDUCE TURNAROUND TIME BY INCREASING THE FOCUS TIME AVAILABLE FOR CASEWORK THROUGH THE ADDITION OF TWO STAFF MEMBERS AND THE USE OF A TRAINED INTERN, ULTIMATELY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CASES ON THE LABORATORY\u0092S BACKLOG.

THESE CASES ARE A PRIORITY TO THE LABORATORY\u0092S CUSTOMERS SINCE THEY COMPRISE 47% OF CODIS PROFILES ENTERED AND 51% OF CODIS HITS RETURNED. LOSS OF THIS CAPACITY WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE NASSAU COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT\u0092S AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICE\u0092S ABILITY TO SOLVE LOCAL CRIMES AND COULD HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS.\n\nENHANCING CASELOAD CAPACITY, MINIMIZATION OF FUTURE BACKLOGS AND THE REDUCTION OF CASE TURNAROUND ARE A HIGH PRIORITY GOAL FOR THE LABORATORY. AT THE CLOSE OF 2017, THE LABORATORY REPORTED A BACKLOG OF 362 DNA CASES WITH A TURNAROUND OF 54 DAYS. THEREFORE, THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS YEAR\u0092S PROGRAM REQUEST REMAIN THE MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT IN CAPACITY FOR THE LABORATORY\u0092S CUSTOMERS AND THE MINIMIZATION OF SIGNIFICANT BACKLOGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN CAPACITY. THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF CASEWORK REAGENTS AND CONSUMABLES ALONG WITH THE USE OF FUNDS TO SUPPORT PERSONNEL OVERTIME INORDER TO ADDRESS THE TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CASE REVIEW BACKLOG, THE LABORATORY HAS SET ITS GOAL TO REDUCE CURRENT TURNAROUND TO A MAXIMUM OF 40 DAYS.\n\nTHE SUCCESS OF THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES PROPOSED FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE MEASURED BY THE EXPECTED DECREASE IN CASE TURNAROUND TIME AND THE NUMBER OF CODIS ELIGIBLE PROFILES ENTERED INTO THE DATABASE. METRICS WILL BE GENERATED BY THE LABORATORY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM REPORT FUNCTION. FOR THIS PROGRAM REPORTING PERIOD THE LABORATORY WILL BE STRIVING TO MEET A GOAL OF A 40-DAY TURNAROUND FOR THE DELIVERY OF TEST RESULTS TO ITS USERS. \n\nNCA/NCF", "Place of Performance Country

SINCE JUNE 2014, THIS BACKLOG HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM OVER 4,000 CASES. PRIOR SUCCESS IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN MAINTAINED, IN PART, THROUGH GRANT FUNDING FOR LABORATORY SUPPLIES, LABORATORY INSTRUMENTATION, AND OVERTIME FOR ANALYSTS. \n\nDUE TO PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED EFFICIENCIES IN ITS CASEWORK PROCESS, THE SECTION NO LONGER UTILIZES OVERTIME, BUT IT DOES PLAN TO CONTINUE THE MODEL OF REQUESTING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR LABORATORY SUPPLIES. A REQUEST FOR TRAINING TRAVEL HAS BEEN MADE TO HELP PROVIDE CONTINUING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANALYSTS IN THE FORENSIC BIOLOGY AND DATABASE SECTIONS. THESE REQUESTS COUPLED WITH CONTINUED PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS, AND ADDITION OF A NEW REGIONAL LABORATORY WILL AID THE SECTION IN INCREASING ITS CAPACITY.

FUNDING FROM THIS GRANT WILL BE USED TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BACKLOGGED CASES IN THE FORENSIC BIOLOGY SECTION, AND TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF THE DATABASE SECTION FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DATABASE SAMPLES AND THEIR UPLOAD INTO CODIS.\n\nTHE FORENSIC BIOLOGY SECTION CURRENTLY HAS A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY 900 FORENSIC BIOLOGY/DNA CASES. SINCE JUNE 2014, THIS BACKLOG HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM OVER 4,000 CASES. PRIOR SUCCESS IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN MAINTAINED, IN PART, THROUGH GRANT FUNDING FOR LABORATORY SUPPLIES AND OVERTIME FOR ANALYSTS. DUE TO PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED EFFICIENCIES IN ITS CASEWORK PROCESS, THE SECTION NO LONGER UTILIZES OVERTIME; BUT IT DOES PLAN TO CONTINUE THE MODEL OF REQUESTING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR LABORATORY SUPPLIES. AN EQUIPMENT REQUEST HAS ALSO BEEN MADE TO HELP INCREASE EFFICIENCY IN PERFORMING ANALYSIS. A REQUEST FOR TRAINING TRAVEL HAS BEEN MADE TO HELP PROVIDE CONTINUING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANALYSTS IN THE FORENSIC BIOLOGY AND DATABASE SECTIONS.\n\nTHESE REQUESTS COUPLED WITH CONTINUED PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS, AND ADDITIONAL ANALYSTS BEGINNING RELEASED FROM TRAINING WILL AID THE SECTION IN INCREASING ITS CAPACITY. BASED ON THIS INCREASE, THE SECTION EXPECTS THE NUMBER OF BACKLOG CASES AND THE TURN-AROUND TIME TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE. \n\nTHE DATABASE SECTION CURRENTLY HAS A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY 600 SAMPLES. PRIOR SUCCESS IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN MAINTAINED THROUGH PROCESS EFFICIENCIES AND TRAINING NEW ANALYSTS. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE DATABASE SECTION HAS USED GRANT FUNDING FOR LABORATORY SUPPLIES FOR THE IN-HOUSE PROCESSING OF DATABASE SAMPLES. \n\nSTATE LEGISLATION FOR AN ALL FELONY ARRESTEE DATABASE CONTINUES TO BE CONSIDERED, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF UNTESTED SAMPLES AND THE TIME IT TAKES TO LOAD THOSE SAMPLES INTO CODIS.

DIFFICULT AUSTERITY MEASURES \u2013 INCLUDING STAGGERED WORK SHIFTS, TELEWORKING, AND PARTIAL LAYOFFS/FURLOUGHS \u2013 CAME AT A TIME WHEN WSPCLD WAS TAKING CHARGE OF AN IMMENSE EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG OF SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS IN WASHINGTON BY 2022; IN PART, DUE TO NEW LEGISLATION ENACTED DURING 2019. ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION IN 2019 ADDED QUALIFYING OFFENSES TO THE CODIS-ELIGIBLE OFFENDER CATEGORY; INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CONVICTED OFFENDER SAMPLES NEEDING TO BE TYPED AND ENTERED INTO THE CODIS DATABASE.

THE FIRST GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF OUR FORENSIC DNA LABORATORIES. THIS GOAL WILL FIRST BE ACCOMPLISHED BY RETAINING TWO GRANT-FUNDED BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES TECHNICIANS FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. THESE LABORATORY EMPLOYEES WILL BE RETAINED TO DIRECTLY PROCESS, RECORD, SCREEN, AND/OR ANALYZE FORENSIC DNA AND/OR DNA DATABASE SAMPLES. THIS WILL ALLOW OUR DNA SCIENTISTS TO FOCUS MORE ON DNA DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION. SECOND, THIS GOAL WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PURCHASING UPGRADED DNA QUANTIFICATION INSTRUMENTS. QUANTSTUDIO 5 (QS5) REAL-TIME PCR SYSTEM FOR HUMAN IDENTIFICATION INSTRUMENTS WILL BE PURCHASED FOR ALL FOUR OF OUR LABORATORIES USING THESE GRANT FUNDS. THE QS5 SYSTEM REQUIRES LESS FREQUENT MAINTENANCE, FASTER ANALYSIS TIMES, AND AN INCREASED THROUGHPUT DUE TO THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE SAMPLE DATA WITH A VIRTUAL STANDARD CURVE. THE SECOND GOAL OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE TO REDUCE BACKLOG WITHIN THE CBIFS FORENSIC DNA LABORATORIES BY FUNDING OVERTIME FOR THE ANALYSIS OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE CASES OUTSIDE OF NORMAL WORK HOURS. THIS WILL INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES THAT OUR CURRENT ANALYSTS CAN COMPLETE DURING THE TIME OF THIS AWARD. IT IS EXPECTED BASED ON CURRENT AVERAGE ANALYSIS TIMES THAT AT LEAST 201 ADDITIONAL CASES WILL BE WORKED USING THE OVERTIME FUNDS FROM THIS AWARD. FINALLY, THE CBIFS MUST BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CODIS DNA DATABASE AT THE LOCAL (LDIS), STATE (SDIS), AND NATIONAL (NDIS) LEVELS. TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, LABORATORIES MUST ADHERE TO FBI QUALITY ASSURANCE STANDARDS (QAS). THESE STANDARDS REQUIRE EVERY DNA ANALYST TO RECEIVE CONTINUING EDUCATION ANNUALLY. FUNDS FROM THIS AWARD WILL ALLOW SOME OF THE ANALYSTS TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING AT NATIONAL CONFERENCES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19
