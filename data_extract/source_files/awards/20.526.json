LPG HAS THE MOST ABUNDANT REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE OF ANY ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND IS THE THIRD MOST COMMENT ENGINE FUEL BEHIND DIESEL AND GASOLINE. LPG IS STORED AT LOW PRESSURE REQUIRING MINIMAL ELECTRICAL POWER TO DISPENSE AS REQUIRED BY CNG OR ELECTRIC BUSES. IT HAS A NARROW FLAMMABILITY RANGE AND THE FUEL TANKS FOR LPG VEHICLES ARE 20 TIMES MORE PUNCTURE RESISTANT THAN GASOLINE FUELED VEHICLES. LPG IS READILY AVAILABLE ECONOMICAL SAFE AND AFFORDABLE FOR A CLEAN-BURNING ALTERNATIVE FUEL. HISTORICALLY LPG HAS BEEN LESS EXPENSIVE BY 30%-50% THAN GASOLINE AND WITHOUT THE HIGH INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS OF CNG AND/OR ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT. JUST BY BURNING A CLEANER FUEL IN THE ENGINE IS IN DIRECT CORRELATION TO LOWERING MAINTENANCE COSTS OF VEHICLES. HIGH MILEAGE VEHICLES VEHICLES THAT DRIVER 25-50000 MILES A YEAR SUCH AS ISLAND TRANSIT OFFER THE BIGGEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN MAINTENANCE COSTS ALONE. CURRENTLY ISLAND TRANSIT SPENDS AN ESTIMATED 52% OF ITS FTA APPORTIONMENT ON MAINTENANCE ALONE AND STILL REQUIRES ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM STATE DOT FUNDS FOR MAINTENANCE COSTS. FOR FY 2022 ISLAND TRANSIT PROGRAMMED MAINTENANCE EXPENSE IS FORECASTED AT $1149875 WHICH WOULD INCLUDES FEDERAL FUNDS AND MATCHING REQUIREMENTS. BY TRANSITIONING TO LPG ISLAND TRANSIT EXPECTS TO REDUCE MAINTENANCE COSTS BY 20% THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION OF LPG BUSES. BY UTILIZING CLEANER AND THE THIRD MOST ABUNDANT FUEL AVAILABLE ISLAND TRANSIT WILL BEGIN THE TRANSITION TO A CLEANER AND GREEN BURNING FUEL IN LPG. ONE LGP VEHICLE ALONE WHEN COMPARED TO GASOLINE REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) BY 24% REDUCES NITROGEN OXIDE (NOX) BY 20% AND REDUCES CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) BY 60 %. WHEN COMPARED TO DIESEL THERE IS 99% FEWER PARTICULATE EMISSIONS AND DPF IS COMPLETELY ELIMINATED. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WOULD BE IMMEDIATE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LPG BUSES ON GALVESTON ISLAND. CARBON EMISSIONS WOULD BE REDUCED IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA AFFECTING THE AIR QUALITY AND THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY THOSE COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS THAT UTILIZE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THE EJ POPULATION WOULD SEE AND FEEL THE IMPACT IMMEDIATELY AS WELL BUSES WITH LPG WITH THE EXPECTED REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS ALONE FROM CLEAN BURNING FUEL WOULD HAVE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. OVER 25% OF THE POPULATION ON GALVESTON ISLAND IS ESTIMATED NOT TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE JUST BY UTILIZING A CLEANER BURNING BENEFITS THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY REDUCING HEALTHCARE COSTS FROM POOR AIR QUALITY. LPG DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO STORE/DISPENSE AND MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR CNG OR ELECTRIC BUSES. AN ESTIMATED MEDIUM SIZE FLEET OF 50-80 UNITS WOULD REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY $700000-$900000 IN DIRECT INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ALONE FOR CNG. FOR AN ELECTRIC FLEET THE COSTS ARE EVEN GREATER IN THE AREA OF $950000-$1.5 MILLION. THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY NECESSARY FOR STORAGE DISPENSING AND MAINTENANCE EXCEEDS THE COSTS OF LPG FUELED VEHICLES ALONE WITH THE COSTS FOR THE SAME MEDIUM SIZE FLEET ESTIMATED TO BE $50000-$80000 FOR LPG FUELED VEHICLES. WHILE THE MPG ON A LPG FUELED VEHICLE IS LESS THAN A GASOLINE VEHICLE DURING THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE THE TOTAL LBS OF CO2 PRODUCE BY AN LPG FUELED VEHICLE IS 43450 LBS LESS THAN A GASOLINE FUELED VEHICLE. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THE IMPACT IS DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE TO THE COMMUNITIES SERVICED THAT ARE TRANSIT DEPENDENT THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO THE TRANSIT AGENCY ITSELF WITH A LOWER OPERATING COSTS AND A HEALTHIER WORKFORCE FROM CLEANER FUELED VEHICLES. SUBRECIPIENTS: NONELOCAL MATCH OF $187839 WILL BE FROM GALVESTON ISLAND TRANSIT CAPITAL FUNDS FUNDING THAT WAS SET ASIDE FOR FLEET REPLACEMENT AS PART OF THE LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENTS. 85% FEDERAL MATCH WILL BE USED FOR BUS PURCHASES SINCE CLEANER FUEL VEHICLES WILL BE ACQUIRED. 80% FEDERAL MATCH WILL BE USED FOR TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. GALVESTON ISLAND TRANSIT (GIT) AS PART OF THE H-GAC MSA OPERATES NOT ONLY IN AN AREA THAT IS IN NON-ATTAINMENT IN REGARDS TO CURRENT OZONE GUIDELINES BUT ALSO ON AN ISLAND THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA. H-GAC AS PART OF THEIR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN VISION FOR TOMORROW 2035 H-GAC LIST MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS TO REDUCE ADVERSE EFFECTS TO THE AIR QUALITY OF THE MSA. ALTERNATIVE FUELS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS OF THOSE MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE CITY OF GALVESTON COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF 2011 ALSO LISTS SEVERAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC INTERESTS ARE MET WHILE PROTECTING AND PRESERVING THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE ISLAND. ISLAND TRANSIT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE MITIGATION STRATEGIES BY IMPLEMENTING A BUS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM THAT UTILIZES ALTERNATIVE FUELS. ISLAND TRANSIT WILL BE REQUESTING FUNDING FOR 5-TRANSIT BUSES FUELED BY LPG. GALVESTON ISLAND TRANSIT CONSIDERED OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELED FLEET REPLACEMENT SUCH AS ELECTRIC OR CNG (COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS). HOWEVER THE INITIAL INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE SO PROHIBITIVE FOR SUCH A SMALL URBAN COMMUNITY SUCH AS CITY OF GALVESTON. AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE HIGH AND PROHIBITIVE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS WAS LPG AND ITS MANY BENEFITS. LPG IS READILY AVAILABLE ON THE ISLAND INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE MINOR IT HAS AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON AIR QUALITY AS IT REDUCES EMISSIONS BY HALF AND THE OVERALL COSTS OF THE PROGRAM IS SIMILAR TO GALVESTON ISLAND TRANSIT CURRENT COSTS OF OPERATING A DIESEL FLEET.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8cf63569-0646-6d04-24bd-9692d8044562-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_TX-2022-036_6955"}, {"internal_id": 151169564, "Award ID": "TX-2022-031", "Award Amount": 896120.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-08-16", "CFDA Number": "20.526", "Description": "THIS APPLICATION IS TO REQUEST FY2020 SECTION 5339 FUNDS APPORTIONED TO THE BRAZOS TRANSIT DISTRICT TEXAS IN THE AMOUNT OF $896120.THIS APPLICATION FOR SECTION 5339 SMALL URBAN IS ALLOCATED TO BRAZOS TRANSIT DISTRICT BY TXDOT SINCE BTD IS A SMALL URBAN DIRECT RECIPIENT THROUGH TXDOT.

IMPLEMENTATION OF PASSENGER SHELTERS AND BUS BOARDING AND ALIGHTING AREAS IN THE SERVICE REGION OF COMMUNITY CONNECTOR. THE CITY OF BANGOR COMMUNITY CONNECTOR BUS SERVICE IS IN CRITICAL NEED OF PASSENGER SHELTERS AND BUS STOPS. COMMUNITY CONNECTOR BUS SERVICE HAS BEEN A FLAG STOP TRANSIT SYSTEM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND ITS THE ONLY SYSTEM LEFT IN THE STATE OF MAINE THAT ALLOWS FLAG BUS STOPS. THE TRANSIT SYSTEM HAS NO DESIGNED BUS STOPS THIS PROJECT WILL NEED TO START FROM THE GROUND UP. FIRST UP WITH BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BUS STOP DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES.THE COMMUNITY CONNECTOR TRANSIT SYSTEM STILL HAS FLAG STOPS ALONG ALL 10 ROUTES AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE TO ANY TYPE OF REAL TIME AVL OR ANY TYPE OF SMART TECHNOLOGY IF THERE ARE NO BUS STOPS. IMPLEMENTING PASSENGER SHELTERS AND BUS BOARDING ALONG OUR 29 SQUARE MILES SERVICE AREA WILL BE A GAME CHANGER. IN OUR LAST TRANSIT RIDER SURVEYS - RIDERS AND DRIVERS ALIKE ARE ASKING FOR THIS IMPROVEMENT. BUS STOPS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON TRANSIT PERFORMANCE. BUS STOPS ARE A KEY LINK IN THE JOURNEY OF A BUS RIDER. BUS STOPS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN COMMUNICATING TO PASSENGERS AND TRANSIT OPERATORS ALIKE WHERE TO BOARD AND GET OFF THE BUSES. THIS IS WHY THIS PROJECT IS SO IMPORTANT AND VITAL TO OUR TRANSIT SYSTEM.; ACTIVITIES PERFORMED: THE GOAL OF THE AWARD IS TO DEVELOP A DESIGNED BUS STOP AND BUS SHELTER DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES. THIS NEEDS TO BE APPROVED AND THEN THE GUIDELINES CAN BE USED TO SETUP THE INITIAL BUS STOPS AND SHELTERS FOR ALL THE ROUTES. PUBLIC MEETINGS DRIVER MEETINGS AND TONS OF OUT REACH WILL NEED TO HAD ALONG THE WAY. PUBLIC MEETINGS FOR CITIZEN AND FOR PASSENGERS ALIKE. THERE WILL NEED TO BE A LOT OF SITE WORK VISITS TO THE SITE OF THE BUS STOPS AND SHELTERS. MAPS WILL NEED TO BE MADE TASKS WILL NEED TO BE OUTLINED. RESEARCH WILL BE TO HAPPEN.AFTER ALL THAT THE BUS STOPS AND BUS SHELTERS WILL BE ON THE GROUND.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: DEVELOPING DESIGNED BUS STOPS WILL BETTER CONNECT BANGORS TRANSIT SERVICE TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THE COMMUNITY CONNECTOR. ESTABLISHING DEDICATED STOPS WILL MAKE THE RIDERS EXPERIENCE SAFER MORE CONVENIENT AND PREDICTABLE ESPECIALLY WHEN REAL TIME INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. BY COMBINING TECHNOLOGY WITH BUS STOPS THE COMMUNITY CONNECTOR CAN ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES WHILE ACCELERATING THE IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICE. THE PROVISION OF BUS STOPS ACROSS THE COMMUNITY CONNECTOR NETWORK WILL BE CONSISTENT TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF SERVICE AND TO PROVIDE CONVENIENT ACCESS TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE REGIONS POPULATION. THE BUS STOP SITING WILL INVOLVE RIDERSHIP TRAVEL TIME CONNECTIVITY TRANSFER POINTS ACCESSIBILITY LAND USE SAFETY STREETSCAPES AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. OUR PLAN WOULD PROPOSE CRITERIA FOR PLACEMENT OF BUS STOPS SUGGESTIONS ON HOW THE ROADWAYS CAN BE CONFINED AND TREATED TO MAKE THE BUS STOPS SAFE FOR BOTH RIDERS AND MOTORIST. THE PLAN WOULD LAY OUT THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF AMENITIES HOW THE STOPS AND AMENITIES SHOULD BE MAINTAINED WHILE INCORPORATING THE TITLE VI AND ADA REQUIREMENTS. BETTER BUS STOPS MAKE BETTER CITIES.

MASSDOT ALSO PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED RTACAP FUNDS FOR ENGINEERING AND LAND ACQUISITION COSTS. THE FRTA CURRENTLY LEASES THEIR 100+ YEAR OLD MAINTENANCE FACILITY ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS. THE CURRENT FACILITY DOES NOT MEET THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATING NEEDS OF THE AUTHORITY AND IS CONTINUING TO DETERIORATE. SINCE PROCEEDING WITH A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR THE NEW FACILITY IN DECEMBER 2021 THE FRTA HAS BEEN WORKING AGGRESSIVELY TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT.

HAVING PROPER SPACE ADEQUATELY DESIGNED FOR SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS NOT ONLY SAVES TIME CONSTANTLY RECONFIGURING THE SPACE TO FIT THE DAILY NEEDS BUT ALSO PROVIDES A SAFER AND MORE SECURE WORK ENVIRONMENT WITH SPECIFIC USE DESIGN IN MIND. THE NEW PROPOSED PROJECT SITE IS LOCATED ALONG TWO FIXED ROUTE LINES AND FRTA IS ALREADY WORKING ON A PLAN TO INCORPORATE TRAVEL PATTERNS FOR THE REMAINDER OF ITS FIXED ROUTES BETWEEN THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS FACILITY AND ITS TRANSIT HUB TO MINIMIZE DEADHEAD TRAVEL COSTS.

THE EMISSION OF HARMFUL GAS IS LOWERED BY 80% FOR THE VEHICLES RUNNING ON CNG. CNG VEHICLES ALSO PRODUCE 45% LESSER HYDROCARBONS THAN OTHER FUEL TYPES. THEREFORE AS MORE AND MORE INDIVIDUALS MOVE TO CNG THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF HARMFUL GAS EMISSIONS WILL REDUCE AND POSITIVELY IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT. CNG IS AN AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER EXPENSIVE FUEL TYPES LIKE DIESEL AND GASOLINE. THE USE OF CNG AS A FUEL HAS INCREASED. ALONG WITH THIS SEVERAL TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS HAVE HELPED MANUFACTURERS LAUNCH VEHICLES THAT FUNCTION EFFICIENTLY WITH CNG. CNG HAS BECOME A MORE AFFORDABLE FUEL OPTION OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND IS CONSIDERED AMONG THE CLEANEST FUEL TYPES BECAUSE CNG LEAVES MINIMAL RESIDUE COMPARED TO OTHER FUEL TYPES LIKE DIESEL OR PETROL. IN ADDITION THE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF RESIDUE RESULTS IN MINIMAL DAMAGE TO THE TUBES AND PIPES OF THE ENGINE. CONSEQUENTLY THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE ENGINE IMPROVES AND ITS LIFESPAN INCREASES. LOW CONTAMINATION ALSO ENSURES THAT VEHICLES DO NOT INCUR FREQUENT MECHANICAL ISSUES. WITH REGARD TO SAFETY CNG IS IN A GASEOUS FORM. IT SMOOTHLY DISPERSES IF THERE IS A LEAK AND DOES NOT SPILL IN OR ON YOUR CAR WHICH MAY CREATE A FIRE HAZARD.

THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THIS PROJECT IS CUSTOMERS THAT MUST UTILIZE ANY TYPE OF MOBILITY DEVICE TO ACCESS OUR BUSES.

CURRENTLY NO STAND-ALONE TRANSIT FACILITY IS LOCATED WITHIN DOWNTOWN BLOOMINGTON WHICH IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL MOBILITY HUBS IN THE CONNECT TRANSIT SERVICE AREA. THIS AREA HANDLES AS MANY AS 2000 RIDERS PER DAY. ON-STREET TRANSFER POINTS ARE LOCATED ON THE SOUTH SIDES OF 100 AND 200 WEST FRONT STREETS APPROXIMATELY TWO BLOCKS FROM THE PROPOSED LOCATION. HOWEVER THESE TWO LOCATIONS CURRENTLY ONLY INCLUDE ONE BUS STOP SHELTER AND BENCH AT EACH LOCATION WHICH RAISES SAFETY AND ACCESSIBILITY CONCERNS.WHILE FREQUENT RIDERS ARE ACCUSTOMED WITH HOW TO TRANSFER BUSES ALONG FRONT STREET THE REQUIREMENT TO CROSS FRONT STREET TO MAKE A TRANSFER CAN BE CONFUSING AND CAN CREATE SAFETY CONCERNS FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE AREA OR ARE INFREQUENT OR NEW RIDERS. THE TRANSFER POINTS CAN BE COMPLICATED WITH HEAVY VEHICULAR MOVEMENTS ON WEST FRONT STREET AND A STEADY STREAM OF BUSES ENTERING AND EXITING THE AREA. IN ADDITION THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF BUS SHELTERS AND BENCHES PARTICULARLY DURING ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS PROVIDES INCREASED SAFETY AND QUALITY OF RIDERSHIP CONCERNS DURING RIDER TRANSFER AND WAITING PERIODS.THE LACK OF A STAND-ALONE TRANSIT FACILITY ALSO AFFECTS THE RELIABILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF TRANSIT OPERATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SPACE AT THE EXISTING TRANSFER POINTS ONLY SEVEN BUSES CAN CONVERGE AT ONE TIME. THIS LIMITS BUS ROUTE SCHEDULING PARTICULARLY DURING PEAK PERIODS WHEN DEMAND IS HIGHEST. THIS LACK OF SPACE PREVENTS CONNECT TRANSIT FROM OPERATING EFFICIENTLY AND CONVENIENTLY BY NOT ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER BUS SEAMLESSLY. THIS LACK OF SPACE ALSO LIMITS THE TRANSIT SERVICES ABILITY TO EXPAND ROUTE CAPABILITIES IN THE FUTURE.; ACTIVITIES PERFORMED: FUNDS WILL BE USED TO DESIGN DEMOLISH AND CONSTRUCT THE TRANSIT RELATED COMPONENTS OF THE TRANSIT CENTER. ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS PROJECT WILL INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND RELOCATION OF A US POST OFFICE WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE CURRENT FACILITY.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: THE NEW FACILITY WILL PROMOTE AND ENHANCE CONNECT TRANSITS MISSION OF PROVIDING SAFE RELIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION THROUGHOUT THE BLOOMINGTON-NORMAL COMMUNITY.; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: BECAUSE THIS PROJECT INCLUDES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW TRANSIT CENTER AND BUS TRANSFER FACILITY IT IS INTENDED TO PRIMARILY RESULT IN PUBLIC TRANSIT BENEFITS TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC TRANSIT USERS AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. BENEFITS WOULD INCLUDE ENHANCING CONNECT TRANSIT SERVICES BY IMPROVING SAFETY ACCESS RELIABILITY AND THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE FOR PASSENGERS.

THE CURRENT LOCATION HAS NO PUBLIC RESTROOM FACILITIES OR AREAS DESIGNED FOR DRIVERS LAYOVER AT THE TRANSFER FACILITY. THE NEW DESIGN WILL HAVE RESTROOMS AND REFRESHMENT AREAS FOR BUS OPERATORS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING COVER DURING PERIODS OF SNOW OR RAIN.

THE AMES TRANSIT AGENCYS (CYRIDES) PROJECT WILL BE ITS THIRD DEPLOYMENT OF ELECTRIC BUS TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE AMES IOWA COMMUNITY. IN MARCH 2019 CYRIDE COMPLETED A 100% LOCALLY FUNDED FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS (SEE ATTACHED CYRIDE_BEB FLEET AND FACILITY TRANSITION STUDY.PDF) TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF OPERATING BATTERY ELECTRIC BUS TECHNOLOGY IN AMES IOWA. THIS STUDY ANALYZED CYRIDES ROUTES COMPARED TO ELECTRIC BUS RANGE CONSTRAINTS ISSUES WITH HOUSING ELECTRIC VEHICLES WITHIN ITS 1980S FACILITY AS WELL AS OVERALL BENEFITS (INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS) AND CHALLENGES CYRIDE MIGHT FACE IN IMPLEMENTING THIS BUS TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONALLY THE STUDY DETERMINED BASED ON CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND VEHICLE RANGE THAT 17 BUSES OR APPROXIMATELY 18% OF CYRIDES FLEET COULD BE OPERATED DAILY WITH DEPOT CHARGING AND NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN HOW CYRIDE DEPLOYS ITS SERVICE. FURTHER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ELECTRIC BUSES WOULD PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL COST AND EMISSIONS SAVINGS OVER THE 18-YEAR LIFE OF THE VEHICLES (CYRIDES USEFUL-LIFE BENCHMARK REPLACEMENT AGE). AS A RESULT CYRIDES TRANSIT BOARD OF TRUSTEES (COMPRISED OF REPRESENTATIVE ORGANIZATIONS AND GENERAL PUBLIC THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY) COMMITTED TO AN INITIAL ELECTRIC BUS PROJECT (2 BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES UNDER IA-2021-002-00) WITH THE GOAL OF MOVING TOWARD THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ELECTRIC BUSES THAT CAN BE EFFICIENTLY DEPLOYED IN ITS OPERATION. THEN WITH THE FY2021 5307 APPORTIONMENT CYRIDE FURTHERED THIS GOAL BY REQUESTING THREE MORE BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES UNDER THAT PENDING GRANT (IA-2021-022-00). THIS GRANT ONCE FUNDED AND PROCURED WILL BRING CYRIDES TOTAL ELECTRIC FLEET TO EIGHT (8) AND CYRIDES TOTAL ARTICULATED BUS FLEET TO TEN (10). ACCORDING TO FTA THE BUSES TO BE REPLACED ONLY NEED TO MEET THE AGE OF 12 YEARS AND/OR A MILEAGE REQUIREMENT OF 500000 MILES ON THESE BUSES. ALL THESE VEHICLES HAVE MET FTAS DEFINED USEFUL LIFE AGE OF 12 YEARS AS THEY ARE ALL 16-17 YEARS OF AGE. WHILE THE BUSES HAVENT REACHED THE 500000 MILEAGE REQUIREMENT TO BE REPLACED THEY ONLY NEED TO MEET THE AGE REQUIREMENT TO MEET FTAS REQUIREMENT. MILEAGE FOR THESE THREE VEHICLES AVERAGE 289894 MILES EACH. THERE IS MODERATE TO HIGH CORROSION ON ALL THESE VEHICLES WITHIN THE ADA REQUIRED WHEELCHAIR LIFTS ON THESE LOW-FLOOR VEHICLES. ALL CYRIDE PURCHASES AFTER 2006 HAVE BEEN ALL LOW-FLOOR VEHICLES WITH WHEELCHAIR RAMPS THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED MANUALLY IF NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE ISSUES WITH CONSTANT BREAKAGE OF HYDRAULIC HOSES ON THESE WHEELCHAIR LIFTS OPERATED IN MIDWESTERN CLIMATE. WHEN A HOSE BREAKS IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE THE BUS OUT OF SERVICE UNTIL THE WHEELCHAIR LIFT IS FULLY REPAIRED. NEW LOW-FLOOR BUSES WOULD ALLOW PASSENGER TO BOARD MORE EASILY WITH ONE STEP ONTO THE BUS AS WELL AS ELIMINATE TAKING THE BUS OUT OF SERVICE FOR REQUIRED WHEELCHAIR LIFT REPAIRS. THEREFORE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE FOUR 2005 VEHICLES BELOW THAT WERE PURCHASED WITH A WHEELCHAIR LIFT WILL PROVIDE ENHANCEMENTS FOR ADA PASSENGERS AS THE NEW VEHICLE WILL PROVIDE A RAMP STYLE FOR ADA PASSENGERS TO EASILY BOARD THE BUSES AND COULD BE MANUALLY DEPLOYED IF NECESSARY.

ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED:THE ATL WAS AWARDED $5473485 IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT THROUGH THE FY2021 SECTION 5339(C) LOW NO PROGRAM PROJECT ID D2021-LWNO-013. FUNDS WILL BE USED TO PURCHASE BUSES BATTERY WARRANTIES BUS DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS/LAPTOP DATA ACCESS TOOLS BUY AMERICA AUDITS QA INSPECTIONS WORKFORCE TRAINING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT/TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM CONSULTANTS. FOR FACILITY UPGRADES FEDERAL FUNDS WILL ALSO BE USED TO PURCHASE AND INSTALL CHARGERS AND DISPENSERS AND CHARGE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE. IN ITS APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL FUNDING ATL NAMED MCI CTE AND ATKINS AS PROJECT PARTNERS. CTE WILL PROVIDE PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES. ATKINS WILL PROVIDE ANY NEEDED ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SERVICES. MCI WILL PROVIDE THE BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES BATTERY WARRANTIES CHARGERS/DISPENSERS CHARGER/DISPENSER INSTALLATION AND CHARGE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE TO OPERATE THE CHARGERS. INSPECTION AND AUDIT SERVICES WILL BE PROCURED VIA THE FTAS SMALL PURCHASES PROCESS WITH A MINIMUM OF TWO BIDS SOLICITED. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT MOST WORKFORCE TRAINING ACTIVITIES WILL BE PROCURED THROUGH MCI HOWEVER SUPPLEMENTAL TRAININGS MAY BE NEEDED ON A COURSE BY COURSE BASES AND PROCURED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH FTA GUIDANCE. EXPECTED OUTCOMES:REPLACING OLD 2004 DIESEL BUSES WITH BE WILL IMPROVE THE RIDER EXPERIENCE AND SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE HARMFUL EMISSIONS AND NOISE POLLUTION PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO XPRESS RIDERS AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES.MCIS D45 CRTE LE CHARGE COMMUTER BUSES MODEL IS THE FIRST AND ONLY BE COMMUTER BUS TO HAVE PASSED ALTOONA TESTING (PASSED DECEMBER 2020). THESE BUSES WILL REPLACE MODEL YEAR 2004 DIESEL COACHES THAT WERE REHABBED IN 2017 AND WILL EXCEED THEIR USEFUL LIFE IN 2021 SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM XPRESS OPERATIONS AND IMPROVING THE SYSTEMS STATE OF GOOD REPAIR. GIVEN THE NATURE OF COMMUTER TRANSIT SERVICE CHARGERS MUST BE DEPLOYED AT A 1:1 RATIO WITH BUSES TO ENSURE ALL VEHICLES CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY RECHARGE IN A BRIEF MIDDAY TIMEFRAME PRIOR TO RESUMING AFTERNOON SERVICE. AN ADDITIONAL CHARGER WILL BE PLACED INSIDE THE MAINTENANCE FACILITY. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES:XPRESS RIDERS AND RESIDENTS OF FULTON CLAYTON AND HENRY COUNTIES ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THIS PROJECT. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CTE AND ATKINS XPRESS COMPLETED A BE BUS NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN 2018 AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD A MORE EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE FLEET. THE ANALYSIS SHOWED BE BUSES CAN SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE ON XPRESS ROUTES 430 431 432 440 441 442 AND 453 WHICH SERVE FULTON CLAYTON AND HENRY COUNTIES IN THE SOUTHERN METRO-ATLANTA REGION.

PHILLIPS CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS AND THE CREATIVE VILLAGE A 68-ACRE MIXED-USE TRANSIT ORIENTED URBAN INFILL NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN ORLANDO. OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY DRIVES CONNECTIVITY A CONTINUING CHALLENGE FOR DOWNTOWN ORLANDO AND LYNX. THESE BUSES WILL SERVE THE CORE DOWNTOWN WITH CONNECTIVITY TO SUNRAIL AND THE LYNX CENTRAL STATION A PRIMARY HUB FOR 31 ROUTES (46%) REGION-WIDE. THE IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTIVITY AND THE FUTURE OF DOWNTOWN ALIGNS WITH THE LYNX INTENT TO MODERNIZE LYMMO BUSES TO ELECTRIC AND TO FUTURE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. BECAUSE OUR FUTURE DEPENDS ON CONNECTIVITY THE DEMANDS FOR MORE AND BETTER TRANSIT OPTIONS IS INEVITABLE. FOR THE CURRENT LYMMO BRT INVESTMENTS TO BE A VIABLE PREFERRED TRANSIT OPTION IT IS INEVITABLE THAT RESOURCES BE LEVERAGED FOR REPLACEMENT BUSES TO ACHIEVE SGR AND BE MORE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS.THIS FUNDING REQUEST WILL COMPLETE THE ZERO ON EMISSION (ZONE) BEB REPLACEMENT PROGRAM FOR THE LYMMO BRT DOWNTOWN ORLANDO CIRCULATOR. THE BEBS IN OUR FLEET MANAGEMENT PLAN WILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDE THE TESTING GROUND FOR THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE MOBILITY INITIATIVE (AVMI) THAT LYNX IS SPEARHEADING FOR THE REGION. THE BUSES TO BE REPLACED PERFORM POORLY AND ARE PROVEN TO BE INADEQUATE TO MEET SERVICE DEMANDS. THE REPLACEMENT OF THESE SGR DEFICIENT BUSES WILL ALLOW INFRASTRUCTURE READINESS FOR FUTURE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY WHICH ALIGNS WITH THE REGIONAL PARTNERS GOALS AND SUPPORTS THE ACCELERATING INNOVATIVE MOBILITY (AIM) INITIATIVE.WITH SUPPORT OF REGIONAL PARTNERS LYNX INTENDS TO REPLACE SIX (6) GILLIG DIESEL BUSES WHICH ARE AVERAGING 662000 MILES AND ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING INCREASED FAILURES. THESE BUSES WERE RATED 2.40 (MARGINAL) IN THE LYNX 2017 ASSET CONDITION ASSESSMENT. CURRENTLY THEY ARE RATED 1 (POOR) AND ARE PAST DUE FOR REPLACEMENT. BY THE TIME THE BUSES ARE ACTUALLY REMOVED FROM SERVICE FY22 AT THE EARLIEST BUSES WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR SERVICE RELIABILITY COMPROMISE SAFETY AND RESULT IN INCREASED OPERATING COSTS. THIS IS A ONE-TIME NEED THAT CANNOT REASONABLY BE FUNDED FROM FTA FORMULA ALLOCATIONS STATE AND LOCAL SOURCES. WITHOUT THIS GRANT LYNX WILL BE UNABLE TO ATTAIN SGR TARGETS FOR REPLACEMENT AND ADDRESS A CRITICAL NEED FOR ELECTRIC BUSES FOR LYMMO SERVICE A PREMIER TRANSIT LEVERAGING THE TRANSFORMATION AND REVITALIZATION PROJECTS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IN DOWNTOWN ORLANDO. THE LYNX FLEET WILL REMAIN WITHIN THE 20% PEAK SPARE RATIO CRITERIA AS THESE BUSES WILL REPLACE EXISTING BUSES.REPLACEMENT BUSES WILL PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY TO SOUTH PARRAMORE ORLANDOS QUALIFIED OPPORTUNITY ZONE 12095010500 NOW ANCHORED INTO THE CITYS ENTERTAINMENT SPORTS DISTRICT AND OTHER MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. A LYMMO BRT SERVICE IN SGR WILL INCREASE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY ON THE SYSTEM AFFORDING PARRAMORE RESIDENTS CONVENIENT ACCESS TO SUNRAIL AND TRANSFERS TO 31 MAJOR LYNX ROUTES. LYMMO BRT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO PARRAMORE EVOLVING AS A FOCUS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS FOR JOB CREATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.LYNX HAS SELECTED THE OUC WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN THE INSTALLATION FOR THE CHARGERS.
