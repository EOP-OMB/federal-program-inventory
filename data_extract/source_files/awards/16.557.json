THE PROGRAM SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF NONPROFIT, NONGOVERNMENTAL TRIBAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT COALITIONS. THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2013 CHANGED THE PROGRAM FROM A DISCRETIONARY PROGRAM TO A MIXED FORMULA AND DISCRETIONARY PROGRAM, WITH EACH RECOGNIZED COALITION RECEIVING AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE FUNDS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROPOSE TO INCORPORATE AND OPERATE NEW TRIBAL COALITIONS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR DISCRETIONARY FUNDING. THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED THROUGH STATUTORY SET-ASIDES FROM THE STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN FORMULA PROGRAM (34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10446(B)(4)) AND THE IMPROVING CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESPONSES TO SEXUAL ASSAULT, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, DATING VIOLENCE, AND STALKING GRANT PROGRAM (34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10461(F)). THE TRIBAL COALITIONS PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES A STATUTORY SET-ASIDE FROM THE SEXUAL ASSAULT SERVICES PROGRAM (SASP), SPECIFICALLY FOR TRIBAL SEXUAL ASSAULT COALITIONS (34 U.S.C. \u00a7 12511(D)(3)(A)). \n\nTHE COALITION TO STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST NATIVE WOMEN (CSVNW) PROVIDES SERVICES TO TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS IN THE NINETEEN PUEBLOS AND TWO APACHE TRIBES (THE JICARILLA APACHE NATION AND MESCALERO APACHE TRIBE) IN NEW MEXICO, AS WELL AS THE NAVAJO NATION (BOTH WITHIN NEW MEXICO AND NORTHERN ARIZONA), THE UTE MOUNTAIN TRIBE OF SOUTHERN COLORADO, AND THE YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO IN SOUTHWESTERN TEXAS. CSVNW COLLABORATES WITH ITS 55 CSVNW MEMBERS, WHICH INCLUDE TRIBAL PROGRAMS, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, SOCIAL SERVICES, SHELTERS, ADVOCACY PROVIDERS, AND SANE PROVIDERS. WITH THIS FUNDING, CSVNW WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER AN ORGANIZED AND COORDINATED EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A REGIONAL AND LOCALIZED RESOURCE CENTER THAT PROVIDES TRAINING, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, POLICY ADVOCACY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT IN THE MOVEMENT TO END VIOLENCE AGAINST NATIVE WOMEN AND CHILDREN. DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT PERIOD, CSVNW WILL: A) PROVIDE COMMUNITY EDUCATION, PREVENTION, AND CAMPAIGNS THAT INCREASE AWARENESS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST NATIVE WOMEN, B) DELIVER TWO LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAININGS TO MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS, AND C) COLLABORATE WITH FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
