IN RECENT DECADES, REPORTED CASES AND GEOGRAPHIC SHIFTS OF (RE)EMERGING VECTOR BORNE DISEASES (VBDS) HAVE INCREASED. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR EFFECTIVE TARGETED MESSAGING ON VECTOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL STRATEGIES, AND A NEED TO EVALUATE CURRENT VBD PREVENTION AND CONTROL METHODS. WE MUST ADDRESS THESE TRAINING AND EVALUATION GAPS TO REDUCE VBD IN HIGH-INCIDENCE SETTINGS.    THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED VBD EDUCATION NETWORK (VBDEN) IS TO BECOME A TRUSTED AND IMPACTFUL RESOURCE FOR VBD PREVENTION AND CONTROL IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE VBDEN HAS A STRONG, COMPLEMENTARY, AND COLLABORATIVE TEAM DEDICATED TO TRAINING AND EVALUATION. THE PROPOSED VBDEN APPROACH IS CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR FOCUS AREAS: 1.\tSTUDENT TRAINING: TRAIN UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS TO INCREASE CAPACITY FOR VBD RESPONSE. WE WILL ESTABLISH A STUDENT TRAINING NETWORK AND DEVELOP COURSES AND DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS TO INCREASE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENT TRAINING. WE WILL EXPAND TRAINING TO FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS TO INCREASE TRAINING IN PROFESSIONS CONNECTED TO VBD (E.G., POLITICAL SCIENCE, VETERINARY, PEST AND VECTOR CONTROL, AND COLLEGIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROFESSIONALS). 2.\tTARGETED TRAINING: DEVELOP, OPTIMIZE, AND EVALUATE TARGETED EDUCATION FOR VBD PREVENTION AND CONTROL. WE WILL WORK WITH AN ADVISORY BOARD FOR VECTOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING (ABVET) TO DEVELOP CONTINUING EDUCATION, CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS, AND REMOTE/IN-PERSON CONFERENCES BASED ON NEEDS ASSESSMENTS OF PROFESSIONAL GROUPS (E.G., INCLUDING VETERINARY, PEST AND VECTOR CONTROL, PUBLIC HEALTH, COLLEGIATE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY PROFESSIONALS). 3.\tEVALUATION: EVALUATE CURRENT VBD PREVENTION AND CONTROL METHODS. WE WILL EVALUATE AND IMPROVE MESSAGING CAMPAIGNS BASED ON SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE METHODOLOGIES.

1 OF THE NOTICE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY CDC-RFA-PS-23-0009 FROM CDC'S NATIONAL CENTER FOR HIV, VIRAL HEPATITIS, STD, AND TB PREVENTION WILL USE THEIR EXPERTISE IN LEGAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND POLICY EVALUATION TO ADVANCE EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES RELATED TO HIV, VIRAL HEPATITIS, STDS, AND TUBERCULOSIS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF HEALTH DECISION MAKERS TO IDENTIFY AND DEPLOY LAWS AND POLICIES THAT IMPROVE HEALTH AND HEALTH EQUITY. THE TEAM WILL IDENTIFY LEGAL TOPICS OF GREATEST SALIENCE TO NCHHSTP; SCIENTIFICALLY BUILD LONGITUDINAL LEGAL DATASETS; MAKE THE LEGAL DATA AVAILABLE TO POLICYMAKERS, THE PUBLIC AND RESEARCHERS ON A CDC-HOUSED WEBSITE/DASHBOARD; WORK WITH CDC TO TIMELY AND RIGOROUSLY EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTS OF THESE LAWS; AND MAKE ALL FINDINGS AND OTHER PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO STAKEHOLDERS IN A TIMELY AND USER-FRIENDLY MANNER.  THIS WORK WILL MEASURABLY 1) INCREASE AWARENESS OF AND ACCESS TO LONGITUDINAL LAW AND POLICY SURVEILLANCE DATASETS, INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF LAWS AND POLICIES THAT REDUCE MORBIDITY, MORTALITY AND HEALTH DISPARITIES, AND 2) INCREASE THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING THE IMPACT THAT LAWS AND POLICIES HAVE ON HEALTH AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES, LEADING TO INCREASED APPLICATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED LAWS AND POLICIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND REDUCE DISPARITIES. THE TEAM WILL EMPLOY BEST SCIENTIFIC PRACTICES FROM LEGAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND POLICY EVALUATION, AND LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE COSTS, IMPROVE EFFICIENCY, AND INCREASE THE USEFULNESS AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE PRODUCTS.  THE TEAM WILL CONDUCT A DATA-DRIVEN LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT -- TO BE REVIEWED ANNUALLY -- TO DETERMINE POLICY TOPICS FOR LEGAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. THE ASSESSMENT WILL INVOLVE THREE MAIN PARTS: 1) IDENTIFYING CANDIDATE LAWS AND LEGAL PRACTICES THAT MAY INFLUENCE LEVELS AND DISPARITIES IN STDS, HIV, VIRAL HEPATITIS, AND TB, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL SYNDEMICS (CO-OCCURRING MULTIPLE NATURE OF MULTIPLE EPIDEMICS); 2) MOBILIZING EXISTING RESEARCH KNOWLEDGE AND THE EXPERTISE OF A DIVERSE GROUP OF SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERTS TO IDENTIFY IMPORTANT RESEARCH QUESTIONS; AND 3) PRIORITIZING POLICIES/RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS.  AFTER THE LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT IS COMPLETE AND TOPICS ARE SELECTED, THE TEAM WILL USE SCIENTIFIC LEGAL MAPPING METHODS TO SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECT AND ANALYZE RELEVANT LAWS. THE TEAM WILL CREATE LONGITUDINAL LEGAL DATASETS IDENTIFYING KEY FEATURES OF THE LAW AND CAPTURING CHANGES IN THE LAW OVER TIME. THE DATASETS WILL INCLUDE THE RELEVANT TEXT OF THE LAW LINKED TO SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES. RIGOROUS QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES WILL BE USED TO ENSURE RELIABILITY OF THE LEGAL DATA PRODUCED. BY CONVERTING THE WORDS OF THE LAW INTO NUMERIC DATA, THE TEAM WILL ENABLE THE DIGITIZATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CREATE DASHBOARDS OF THE KINDS NCHSSTP IS PLANNING. THE TEAM PLANS TO USE THE SAME RIGOROUS RESEARCH PROCESS FOR UPDATING DATASETS IN THE FINAL YEAR OF THE PROJECT.  THE TEAM WILL USE THE LEGAL DATA CREATED, ALONG WITH QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DESIGNS, APPLICATION OF THE NOVEL POLICY TARGET TRIAL EMULATION FRAMEWORK, AND DATA SCIENCE BEST PRACTICES TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF KEY POLICIES ON MORBIDITY, MORTALITY AND DISPARITIES IN HIV, VIRAL HEPATITIS, STDS, AND TUBERCULOSIS. THE TEAM WILL DEVELOP NUMEROUS DELIVERABLES WITH VARYING LEVELS OF RIGOR AND SPEED, AND DEPLOY VARIOUS STUDY DESIGN METHODS AFTER CONVERSATION WITH THE CDC.

THERE ARE LAWS THAT PERPETUATE INEQUITY IN ALL SOCIAL STRUCTURES, INCLUDING HOUSING, HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, AND BEYOND. IN PUBLIC HEALTH, THESE FACTORS ARE IDENTIFIED AS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH\u2014CONDITIONS IN THE PLACES PEOPLE LIVE, LEARN, WORK, AND PLAY THAT AFFECT A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE RISKS AND OUTCOMES. AS A RESULT, INEQUITIES IN THESE AREAS TRANSLATE DIRECTLY TO DISPARITIES IN HEALTH. REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND DECREASING THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OF DISEASES CAN REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS, IMPROVE GOVERNMENTAL EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF A POPULATION.  IN ORDER TO DECREASE THE MORTALITY, MORBIDITY, AND DISPARITIES OF HIV, VIRAL HEPATITIS, STDS, AND TB IN U.S. POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING HEALTH DISPARITIES, AND IN RESPONSE TO COMPONENT 2 OF THE NOTICE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY, NNPHI WILL CREATE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COORDINATION AND RESOURCE CENTER (\u201cRESOURCE CENTER\u201d) TO PROVIDE BOTH PROACTIVE AND RESPONSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LEADERS MAKING DECISIONS IN PUBLIC HEALTH IN STATE, LOCAL, TRIBAL, AND TERRITORIAL JURISDICTIONS NAVIGATING COMPLEX LAW AND POLICY ISSUES.
