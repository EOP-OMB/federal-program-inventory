SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED AT THE TWO FULL TIME WELLNESS CENTERS TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS IN THE ORAL HEALTH CARE TREATMENT PROCESS AND OPTIMIZE HEALTH OUTCOMES.  BARRIERS, INCLUDING STIGMA AND FEAR WILL BE ELIMINATED WITH THE RECEIPT OF CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FUNDING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSED ACTIVITY UNDER INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT IS TO EXPAND OUR ORAL HEALTH CARE CAPACITY TO LOW INCOME, UNINSURED, AND UNDERSERVED RW PART C CLIENTS. THE MODEL WILL ADDRESS THE NATIONAL HIV/ AIDS CARE CONTINUUM.  IF AWARDED, PART C CAPACITY BUILDING FUNDING WILL PROVIDE DENTAL BAYS IN OUR TWO FULL TIME WELLNESS CENTERS ENABLING PATIENTS TO RECEIVE ROUTINE DENTAL SERVICES WITHIN THE WELLNESS CENTER.   THE SEHD WELLNESS CENTERS SERVE SEVERAL MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. THE SEHD COVERS 8,017 SQUARE MILES, ABOUT THE SIZE OF MASSACHUSETTS, AND IS NOT SERVED BY A MAJOR INTERSTATE. I-95 IS EAST OF THE DISTRICT ALONG THE COAST; I-16 RUNS THROUGH THE AREA FROM MACON TO SAVANNAH THROUGH CANDLER, TOOMBS AND BULLOCH COUNTIES, BUT OFFERS NO ACCESS TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE OTHER COUNTIES. LIKE MANY RURAL AREAS ACROSS AMERICA, THE SEHD IS FACED WITH SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHICH IS ANOTHER BARRIER TO CARE. ALL SIXTEEN COUNTIES LOCATED WITHIN THE SEHD ARE DESIGNATED AS MEDICALLY  UNDERSERVED AREAS PER THE GEORGIA STATE OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH. ALL COUNTIES ARE EITHER HIGH NEEDS GEOGRAPHIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSA) OR HPSA LOW INCOME POPULATION. SEHD HAS BECOME RECOGNIZED AS THE PRIMARY PROVIDER OF SERVICES FOR PATIENTS WITH HIV/AIDS IN THE SIXTEEN-COUNTY AREA. IN FACT, THERE IS NO OTHER PROVIDER OF HIV SERVICES IN THE 8017-SQUARE MILE SERVICE AREA AND NO OTHER RYAN WHITE RECIPIENTS.    THE GOAL OF THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FUNDING IS TO ADDRESS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT BY PROVIDING DENTAL SERVICES TO PATIENTS SERVED BY THE WELLNESS CENTERS. THE SEHD HAS UTILIZED TELEMEDICINE WITHIN THE WELLNESS CENTER CLINICS TO ENHANCE HIV AND PRIMARY CARE SERVICES BEING RENDERED TO UNDERSERVED AND LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS, HOWEVER, CLIENTS ARE STILL FORCED TO RECEIVE ORAL HEALTH SERVICES FROM OUTSIDE PROVIDERS.  CLIENTS ARE OFTEN UNWILLING TO BE SEEN BY OUTSIDE PROVIDERS DUE TO STIGMA AND FEAR.  THE SEHD IS THE LARGEST RURAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA WHICH IS A BARRIER TO PATIENT AND PROVIDER INTERACTION NEEDED FOR OPTIMAL CARE. UTILIZING WELLNESS CENTER DENTAL BAYS WILL IMPROVE CLIENTS\u2019 ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL ORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT THEY MAY NOT OTHERWISE RECEIVE.  THE PROGRAM WILL BE SUSTAINED THROUGH INCOME GENERATED FROM THIRD PARTY PAYORS BILLED FOR DENTAL SERVICES PROVIDED.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE TWO WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VANS, THEY SERVE ONLY SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND THE DEMAND FOR TRANSPORTATION EXCEEDS THEIR AVAILABILITY.   FURTHER, THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY HIGH IN THESE TWO COUNTIES. WE HAVE HAD STAFF CHURNING IN THIS D EPARTMENT AS STAFF INITIALLY WORK WITH US TO GAIN THEIR CLINICAL HOURS FOR LICENSURE, AND ONCE THEY ARE LICENSED, THEY LEAVE FOR HIGHER PAYING POSITIONS OR TO BEGIN THEIR OWN PRIVATE PRACTICES. MORE AND MORE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PERSONNEL ARE CHOOSING TO WORK FROM HOME, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT QUALIFIED STAFF.

OF THE 1.9 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN NEBRASKA, APPROXIMATELY HALF LIVE IN OMAHA AND LINCOLN. THE REMAINDER OF THE STATE IS DESIGNATED AS RURAL OR FRONTIER, AND 70 OF NEBRASKA\u2019S 93 COUNTIES MEET CRITERIA FOR MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS AND/OR POPULATIONS. THE UNMC HIV CLINIC REMAINS THE ONLY DEDICATED FACILITY IN THE REGION AND SERVES A GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF ALMOST 70,000 SQUARE MILES AND OVER 1,250 ACTIVE CLIENTS. THE UNMC PART C PROGRAM HAS SEVERAL DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY PRIMARY COMPREHENSIVE HIV HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND IS EXPERIENCED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS.   SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITY AND ITS INTENDED IMPACT: WE PROPOSE USING RYAN WHITE PART C CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT GRANT FUNDING HIV CARE INNOVATION FOR INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH HIV PRIMARY CARE. THESE SERVICES WILL TARGET ALL ADULT MALES 25 AND OLDER LIVING WITH HIV INFECTION IN THE SERVICE AREA WITH A FOCUS ON LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED, AND RURAL POPULATIONS.  MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE REPORTED COMMONLY IN PEOPLE WITH HIV (PWH) IN OUR CLINIC (43% A ND 20%, RESPECTIVELY). ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE WITH 88 OUT OF 93 COUNTIES IN NEBRASKA DESIGNATED AS HAVING A SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS; AND 41% OF PATIENTS REPORTING COST TO BE THE MAIN BARRIER FOR ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.   WE HAVE RECENTLY HIRED A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THERAPIST AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CONTRACTING WITH A PSYCHIATRIST, BUT WE ARE IN NEED FOR TRAINING, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE SYSTEMATIC AND SUSTAINABLE INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH HIV PRIMARY CARE. CONSUMER INVOLVEMENT IS KEY TO ENSURE PATIENTS\u2019 NEEDS ARE MET AND THEIR FEEDBACK IS INCORPORATED IN THE DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES.   WE HAVE RECENTLY BUILT COLLABORATION WITH THE NEBRASKA MEDICINE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT WHO WILL BE OUR MAIN PARTNER TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: 1) DEVELOPING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON INTEGRATION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICED INTO OUR CLINIC FLOW; 2) TRAINING HIV PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ON SCREENING, REFERRAL, AND MANAGEMENT OF COMMON MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN PWH; 3) MEASURING OUTCOMES OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SCREENING AND REFERRAL ON HIV OUTCOMES SUCH AS VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AND ENGAGEMENT IN CARE; AND   4) ESTABLISHING A SUSTAINABLE CONSULTATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH NEBRASKA MEDICINE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT.  RESEARCH HAS SHOWN REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE, POOR HIV SELF-MANAGEMENT, AND INCREASED HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION, POOR ADHERENCE, AND INTERNALIZED STIGMA AMONG PWH WITH POOR MENTAL HEALTH.

UNDERSTANDING THE INTENSE STIGMA RELATED TO IPV, THE UTILIZATION OF CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FUNDING WILL BE DIRECTED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF A DISTINCT DESIGNATION OF SERVICES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY OF AIDS CARE GROUP; BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, DISSEMINATED TO ALL STAFF MEMBERS OF THE AGENCY.  WORKING FROM WITHIN THE AGENCY AND AMONG ALL STAFF MEMBERS SO THAT OUTREACH OF INFORMATION AND REFERRALS INTO CLINICAL CARE FOR NEEDY PATIENTS CAN BE SEEN AS A UNIVERSAL COMPONENT OF CARE IS BEING DEFINED AS AN IMPORTANT FOUNDATION FOR IPV PROGRAMS.  CURRENT CONDITIONS OF COMMUNITY HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RESOURCES FOR MINORITY COMMUNITIES HAVE DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY STARTING IN MARCH 2020 DUE TO COVID-19; AND ARE STILL NOT EXPECTED TO REGAIN PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS FOR MANY MONTHS.  IPV HAS BEEN AN UNDER-RECOGNIZED AND UNDER-REFERENCED CONDITION IN THE HEALTH HISTORIES OF MANY OF THE PATIENTS OF AIDS CARE GROUP AND MAY BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE INABILITY OF THE AGENCY TO MOVE PAST 90% VIRAL SUPPRESSION RATES AMONG ALL PATIENTS IN CARE.  CONSEQUENTLY, FOR INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH, THE DEVELOPMENT O F AN IPV PROGRAM THAT IS IDENTIFIABLE AND CAPABLE OF INITIATING TIMELY REFERRALS INTO CARE TO WOMEN LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS IS ESSENTIAL AT THIS TIME.  THE PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN DELAWARE COUNTY AND BERKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA BY STAFF OF AIDS CARE GROUP WITHIN THEIR FOUR CLINICAL LOCATIONS; WITH COLLABORATIONS BY LOCAL HEALTH, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, REGARDLESS OF WEALTH, EDUCATION, GENDER, OR RACE, IPV HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON THESE COMMUNITIES; AND THIS IMPACT IS AFFECTING THE ABILITY OF PROVIDERS OF AIDS SERVICES TO WITNESS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE RETENTION IN CARE AND SUPPRESSED VIRAL LOADS AMONG PERSONS IN CARE.

THIS PROJECT WILL RESULT IN IMPROVEMENTS TO THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF DENTAL CARE PROVIDED TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH). THE PROJECT ACTIVITIES FALL UNDER THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT CATEGORY. A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED ACTIVITY AND ITS INTENDED IMPACT.   WITH HIV SPECIALTY DENTAL CLINICS IN MILWAUKEE, MADISON, AND GREEN BAY, VIVENT HEALTH IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF OUTPATIENT HIV DENTAL CARE IN WISCONSIN. IN 2020, VIVENT HEALTH PROVIDED COMPREHENSIVE AND SPECIALIZED DENTAL CARE TO 888 HIV PATIENTS THROUGH 2,215 VISITS. VIVENT HEALTH PROVIDED CARE TO 617 HIV PATIENTS THROUGH 1,508 VISITS IN 2020 AT ITS MILWAUKEE DENTAL CLINIC ALONE. DUE TO INCREASING DEMAND FOR VIVENT HEALTH\u2019S HIV MEDICAL HOME MODEL OF CARE AND ONGOING ECONOMIC HARDSHIP IMPACTING PLWH, VIVENT HEALTH PROJECTS TO SERVE AN ADDITIONAL 1,000 HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS AND CLIENTS IN WISCONSIN OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. TO ACCOMMODATE THIS PROJECTED GROWTH, VIVENT HEALTH IS DEVELOPING A NEW 46,277 SQUARE FOOT HIV MEDICAL HOME IN MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN THAT INCLUDES THE BUILDOUT OF EIGHT (8) NEW DENTAL OPERATORIES. THIS IS AN ALMOST 40% EXPANSION FROM VIVENT HEALTH\u2019S CURRENT FIVE (5) DENTAL OPERATORIES.  VIVENT HEALTH IS SEEKING $150,000 IN RYAN WHITE PART C CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FUNDING UNDER THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT CATEGORY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPM ENT OF OUR NEW 46,277 SQUARE FOOT HIV MEDICAL HOME FACILITY AND ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING GOALS: 1) EXPAND THE VIVENT HEALTH DENTAL SERVICE CAPACITY AT ITS NEW HIV MEDICAL HOME; AND 2) ENHANCE DENTAL CARE SERVICES TO PLWH THROUGH EQUIPMENT UPGRADES AND INSTALLATION AT VIVENT HEALTH\u2019S DENTAL CLINIC IN THE NEW HIV MEDICAL HOME. THESE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY EQUIPPING EIGHT (8) DENTAL OPERATORIES IN THE NEW VIVENT HEALTH HIV MEDICAL HOME WITH RADIUS DELIVERY SYSTEMS, ACCESSORY CONSOLES, AND DISPENSING UNITS; AND PURCHASING AND INSTALLING THE NEW WATER PUMPING AND VACUUM SYSTEM THAT WILL SERVICE ALL NEW DENTAL OPERATORIES. UPGRADING TO THE RADIUS DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE CABINET UNITS IN EIGHT MILWAUKEE DENTAL OPERATORIES WILL ENHANCE PATIENT EXPERIENCE, PROVIDING A SAFER AND MORE COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR BOTH VIVENT HEALTH PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS. DENTAL STAFF WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE OF OTHER EQUIPMENT, AS OUTLINED IN THE INTERNAL MAINTENANCE POLICIES.

A TOTAL- 35% OF AAPHC RURAL HIV MODEL USERS, IN 2021, WERE BELOW 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL) AND 50% WERE BELOW 200% FPL.    AAPHC HAS BEEN AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE HIV/AIDS HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM, IN SOUTHWEST GEORGIA, SINCE THE FIRST HIV/AIDS CASES WERE REPORTED AND DIAGNOSED (IN THE AREA) IN 1983.   AAPHC, CURRENTLY, PROVIDES MORE THAN 80% OF INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV/AIDS, IN SOUTHWEST GEORGIA, WITH CARE/SERVICES.

THIS SUPPORTIVE ACTIVITY WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR THE PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN FOR ENSURING CONTINUITY OF CARE TO HIV/AIDS PATIENTS RETAINED IN CARE BY THE AGENCY. THROUGHOUT THE 24-YEAR HISTORY OF AIDS CARE GROUP, THE AGENCY HAS CONTENDED WITH A MULTITUDE OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EMERGENCIES THAT HAVE DISRUPTED THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE TO OUR PATIENTS, FROM NATURAL DISASTERS TO PANDEMIC DISEASE.  WE HAVE DEALT WITH EVERYTHING FROM FIRES TO SNOWSTORMS, FROM SEWER BACKUPS TO POWER OUTAGES. EACH TIME, STAFF MEMBERS OF THE AGENCY HAVE FACED THE EMERGENCY AT HAND WITH DRIVE AND DETERMINATION \u2013 THEY ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM, DETERMINED A SOLUTION, AND RESUMED THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE TO PATIENTS QUICKLY AND SAFELY.  HOWEVER, THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE CLEARLY SHOWN US THAT IT\u2019S NO LONGER TENABLE TO ADDRESS EMERGENCY PROBLEMS WHEN THEY ARISE.  INSTEAD, AGENCIES MUST TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH IF THEY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO BE PREPARED FOR THE UNCERTAINTY OF TOMORROW. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS MUST NOW FOCUS ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF HAZARD THREATS BEFORE THEY OCCUR, ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL MITIGATION OF SUCH THREATS, DEVELOP A PLAN FOR RESPONDING TO THREATS WHEN THEY DO ARISE, AND A PLAN FOR RESUMING NORMAL OPERATIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  COMMUNICATIONS, CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS, AND STAFF TRAINING PLANS MUST BE DEVELOPED.  EVERY KEY MEMBER OF THE ORGANIZA TION MUST RECEIVE INITIAL AND ONGOING TRAINING ON WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF EMERGENCY SO THAT WHEN EMERGENCIES ARISE, THEY KNOW WHERE TO BE AND WHAT TO DO. ADDITIONALLY, EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CANNOT BE CONDUCTED IN A VACUUM.  STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS NEED TO BE FORGED WITH LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLANNERS AND HEALTH CARE COALITIONS SO THAT WE MAY SHARE VALUABLE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES THAT THREATEN TO OVERWHELM THE LOCAL HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY.   \tTHE PANDEMIC EVENTS OF THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE SERVED AS A DIRE WARNING FOR WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN SYSTEMS FAIL.  OVERNIGHT, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS CARE TO OUR PATIENTS WAS THREATENED BY COMPOUNDING EMERGENCIES, SUPPLY-CHAIN FAILURES, SOCIAL UNREST, AND A LACK OF INFORMATION. IT FELT LIKE EVERY DAY WE WERE RESPONDING TO A NEW EMERGENCY, AND IT BECAME NECESSARY TO HANDLE MULTIPLE PRESSING ISSUES AT THE SAME TIME \u2013 LIKE SOURCING TOILET PAPER, MASKS, AND PAPER TOWELS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURING PATIENTS COULD CONTINUE THEIR MEDICAL CARE SAFELY.  THESE EXPERIENCES, WHEN COMBINED WITH THE EXPERIENCES OF THE LAST 24 YEARS, HAVE AMPLIFIED THE CALL TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE ALL-HAZARDS VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND DEVELOP A ROBUST EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN.

TARGET POPULATIONS: PRCONCRA SERVES ANNUALLY A POPULATION OF OVER 939 HISPANIC, LOW INCOME, UNDER INSURED AND UNINSURED, AND HARD TO REACH CLIENTS. OVER A HALF OF THE CLIENTS ARE RESIDENTS OF THE SAN JUAN METROPOLITAN AREA. APPROXIMATELY A HALF RECEIVE SERVICES FUNDED BY RYAN WHITE PART C FUNDS.

KC CARE FURTHER REQUESTS FUNDING PREFERENCE FOR THIS REQUEST, AS MORE THAN 50% OF PATIENTS SERVED WILL BELONG TO UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.   KC CARE\u2019S RAPID ART PROGRAM, SAME DAY START (SDS), WAS LAUNCHED IN JANUARY 2021 IN RESPONSE TO EVIDENCE FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) TRIALS DEMONSTRATING THAT SDS SHOWED GREATER EFFICACY IN HELPING PEOPLE NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH HIV ACCESS TREATMENT, REMAIN IN CARE, AND ACHIEVE VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION (VLS). ACHIEVING VLS IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE AT KC CARE, AS SUBSTANTIAL DISPARITIES EXIST BASED ON AGE AND RACE/ETHNICITY AMONG PEOPLE WITH AND AT RISK OF EXPOSURE TO HIV. SPECIFICALLY, INDIVIDUALS AGES 25 TO 34 ARE AT A GREATER RISK OF HIV EXPOSURE AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE VIRAL SUPPRESSION. BLACK, INDIGENOUS, AND PEOPLE OF COLOR (BIPOC) ARE ALSO AT GREATER RISK OF HIV EXPOSURE AND ACHIEVE VIRAL SUPPRESSION AT LOWER RATES THAN THEIR PEERS.   THE IMPLEMENTATION OF KC CARE\u2019S SDS PROGRAM WAS A SUCCESS, REACHING 39 PATIENTS IN THE FIRST YEAR. OF THESE 39 PATIENTS, 23 (67%) ACHIEVED VIRAL SUPPRESSION. KC CARE\u2019S PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH HELPED ENSURE PATIENTS\u2019 ENROLLMENT AND RETENTION IN THE PROGRAM. UPON RECEIVING A REACTIVE TEST, A LINKAGE TO CARE (LTC) COORDINATOR MAKES FIRST CONTACT WITH A PATIENT. EDUCATION ABOUT SDS IS PROVIDED, AND IF THE PATIENT ELECTS TO PARTICIPATE, THE LTC COORDINATOR WILL ARRANGE A SAME-DAY VISIT WITH A KC CARE PROVID ER. MEDICAL VISITS ARE FOLLOWED-UP WITH A REFERRAL TO A PEER EDUCATOR, A KC CARE PROFESSIONAL WHO ASSISTS PATIENTS IN UNDERSTANDING THEIR DIAGNOSIS, ADHERING TO TREATMENT, ACHIEVING VLS, AND ACCESSING COMMUNITY RESOURCES. TO REACH MORE PATIENTS NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH HIV AND HELP ELIMINATE DISPARITIES IN VIRAL SUPPRESSION, KC CARE SEEKS FUNDING TO EXTEND THE AVAILABILITY OF SDS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO TEST REACTIVE FOR HIV WITH ANY PROVIDER, IN THE COMMUNITY, OR USING AN AT-HOME HIV TEST IN THE KANSAS CITY TGA.

THESE KITS INCLUDE ESSENTIAL ITEMS TO MAKE PATIENTS MORE COMFORTABLE DURING THEIR INITIAL HIV CARE VISIT, WHICH CAN BE STRESSFUL, SUCH AS BOTTLED WATER, SNACKS, AND A NOTEPAD AND PAPER TO TAKE NOTES ON CARE INSTRUCTIONS AND FUTURE APPOINTMENTS.

THE GOAL OF DAP\u2019S PROPOSED CHW HIV OUTREACH PROGRAM IS MEET THE NEED TO IMPROVE RATES OF DIAGNOSIS AND LINKAGE TO CARE IN DAP\u2019S TRANSITIONAL GRANT AREA FOR TARGETED HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS, TO INCLUDE LATINX, BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN, MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN, AND TRANSGENDER WOMEN. THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROPOSED HIV CARE INNOVATION PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR CHWS WITHIN DAP\u2019S ESTABLISHED AND COMPREHENSIVE HIV SERVICES ENCOMPASSING THE ENTIRE HIV CARE CONTINUUM: TESTING/DIAGNOSIS, LINKAGE TO CARE, RETENTION IN CARE, PRIMARY HIV CARE AND WRAP-AROUND SUPPORT SERVICES (DENTAL CARE; INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE INCLUDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COUNSELING; CASE MANAGEMENT; PEER-LED SUPPORT GROUPS FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH HIV; FOOD DISTRIBUTION; HOUSING PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE; JOB PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE; AND WELLNESS SERVICES) SUPPORTING HIV-POSITIVE CLIENTS TO ACHIEVE VIRAL SUPPRESSION. AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS AND HIV CARE, CHWS WILL FACILITATE ACCESS TO EIS, WHICH IN TURN WILL DETERMINE AND CONFIRM HIV DIAGNOSIS AND RAPIDLY LINK NEWLY DIAGNOSED AND RETURNING TO CARE INDIVIDUALS TO HIV CARE AND TREATMENT. PROPOSED ACTIVITIES INCLUDE DEVELOPING STRATEGIES, CREATING WORKFLOWS, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES, AND ADAPTING EXISTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT A NEW CHW PROGRAM; RECRUITING CULTURALLY AND LINGUI STICALLY COMPETENT CHWS WHO ARE MEMBERS OR REFLECTIVE OF HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS; PROVIDING CHW TRAINING FOR NEWLY HIRED CHWS AND THEIR SUPERVISORS; COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS FOR PLACEMENT OF CHWS, AND STRATEGIC PLACEMENT OF CHWS IN COMMUNITIES FOR OUTREACH TO AND ENGAGEMENT OF TARGETED HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS. DAP WILL INITIATE A BROAD- BASED RECRUITMENT STRATEGY USING DAP SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS, PRINT MEDIA, OUTREACH TO DAP\u2019S CLIENT ADVISORY BOARD (CAB) AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. SUCCESSFUL CHW CANDIDATES WILL DEMONSTRATE CULTURAL COMPETENCE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF LIVED/SHARED EXPERIENCE WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES SUCH AS LIVING WITH HIV; EXPERIENCING STIGMA WITHIN THEIR POPULATION BASED ON SEXUAL IDENTITY; OR GENERAL FEAR OF ENGAGING IN HEALTHCARE, AND THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO CONNECT WITH AND SERVE THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE SUCCESS FOR NEWLY HIRED CHWS, DAP WILL PROVIDE THOROUGH TRAINING ABOUT THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF CHWS INCLUDING TOPICS SUCH AS STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION RELATED TO HIV, COMMUNICATION SKILLS, MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING, MAINTAINING PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES, UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, AND OVERCOMING CHALLENGES IN ENGAGING HARD-TO-REACH, HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS. IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM, DAP WILL MAINTAIN ONGOING COLLABORATIONS WITH LOCAL PARTNERS WHO ALSO SERVE PLWHA AND INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH-RISK FOR ACQUIRING HIV.

ARARAT IS REQUESTING $150,000.00 TO FURTHER ENHANCE ITS CAPACITY TO USE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE OR SUPPORT CLINICAL CARE AT A DISTANCE.  THESE ENHANCEMENTS WILL ENABLE ARARAT CLINICAL STAFF, INCLUDING NUTRITION COUNSELORS, MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS AND MEDICAL CASE MANAGERS, TO REACH OUT TO ARARAT PATIENTS SAFELY AND TO LINK AND RETAIN THEM IN CARE REGARDLESS OF THREATS TO PATIENT SAFETY OR THEIR LACK OF ACCESS TO SAFE TRANSPORTATION.   THE ENHANCEMENTS INCLUDE UPGRADES TO ARARAT\u2019S SYSTEMS AND SERVERS THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE NECESSARY TO IMPROVE ITS TECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY AND EASE OF USE.  WITH FUNDING FROM THE PROJECT, ARARAT WILL ALSO IMPROVE UPON ITS PATAGONIA ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD BY ACQUIRING PATAGONIA\u2019S CONTACTLESS PATIENT PORTAL FOR IMPROVED PATIENT ACCESS AND CONTROL OVER REMOTE SERVICES, INCLUDING SELF-SERVICE SCHEDULING OF APPOINTMENTS, SUBMISSION OF REQUIRED FORMS AND CERTIFICATIONS,  REMOTE CHECK-IN, DOCUMENT SCANNING AND REALIZING PAYMENTS.
