WE WILL CONSULT WITH OGLALA LAKOTA COMMUNITY NURSING PROGRAM IN PINE RIDGE, SOUTH DAKOTA IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROJECT. THE SDOH-NPATH PROJECT INCREASES AND STRENGTHENS SDOH EDUCATION FOR NURSING STUDENTS, CLINICAL AND THEORY FACULTY, PRECEPTORS, AND NURSING LEADERS FROM PARTNERING HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING CULTURALLY ALIGNED QUALITY NURSING SERVICES IN ACUTE CARE SETTINGS IN RURAL AND URBAN UNDERSERVED AREAS IMPROVING RETENTION AND RESILIENCE OF NURSING STAFF IN ACUTE CARE SETTINGS. SDOH-NPATH STRIVES TO INCREASE DIVERSITY IN THE NURSING WORKFORCE WHILE ENHANCING HEALTHCARE EQUITY IN URBAN AND RURAL UNDERSERVED ACUTE CARE SETTINGS THROUGH DEVELOPING PROGRAMMING WITH CULTURALLY DIVERSE HIGH SCHOOLS IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS. OUTCOMES ARE TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF CULTURALLY DIVERSE NURSING STUDENTS AND ULTIMATELY CULTURALLY DIVERSE NURSES WHO INCORPORATE SDOH INTO THEIR ACUTE CARE NURSING PRACTICE. SDOH-NPATH IS BASED ON THESE OBJECTIVES: OBJECTIVE 1: CREATE AN ACUTE CARE NURSE SCHOLARS PROGRAM (ACNSP) AND SUMMER FELLOWSHIP IN ACUTE CARE NURSING PROGRAM (SFACNP). THE ACNSP WILL BEGIN IN THE SPRING OF THE STUDENT\u2019S FIRST YEAR OF NURSING EDUCATION AND CONTINUE THROUGH GRADUATION WHERE THEY WILL EARN THE DESIGNATION OF ACUTE CARE NURSE SCHOLAR (ACNS). THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON SDOH EVIDENCE-BAS ED KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ATTITUDES, PARTICULARLY FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN URBAN AND RURAL SETTINGS. THE ACNSP WILL BE OPEN TO TRADITIONAL, ACCELERATED, HYBRID ACCELERATED, RN-BSN STUDENTS AND GRADUATE NURSING STUDENTS. THE SFACNP WILL BE OFFERED IN THE SUMMER BETWEEN THE JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR FOR TRADITIONAL NURSING STUDENTS. OBJECTIVE 2: ENHANCE AND EXPAND RECRUITMENT OF DIVERSE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS INTO NURSING PROGRAMS BY ENGAGING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT REPRESENT UNDERSERVED MINORITY GROUPS. THE ACNS WILL PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS UNDERSTANDING OF NURSING. OBJECTIVE 3: CREATE FOUR TRACKS OF FACE-TO-FACE AND ASYNCHRONOUS, E-LEARNING MODULES FOR A) UNDERGRADUATE NURSING STUDENTS, B) CLINICAL FACULTY AND PRECEPTORS, C) THEORY FACULTY, AND D) NURSING LEADERS IN PARTNERING INSTITUTIONS TO ENSURE INTEGRATION. THE FOUR PATHS (PRE-PROFESSIONAL, PRECEPTOR, PATIENT, AND POPULATION) OF LOYOLA\u2019S PATH MODEL ORGANIZES THE PROJECT ACTIVITIES. THE PRE-PROFESSIONAL PATH (I.E., STUDENT) INCLUDES A CURRICULUM WITH ONLINE, HYBRID, INTERACTIVE, EXPERIENTIAL, AND SIMULATED SDOH ACUTE CARE MODULES. THE PRECEPTOR PATH EDUCATES CLINICAL AND THEORY FACULTY AND SITE PRECEPTORS IN SDOH ACUTE CARE CONTENT TO SUPPORT NURSE RESILIENCE AND RETENTION. THE PATIENT PATH INCORPORATES ASSESSMENTS OF PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH COMPLEX ACUTE CONDITIONS USING CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE SDOH STRATEGIES.

INTERPROFESSIONAL COLLBORATIVE PRACTICE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN INCREMENTAL, ACCELERATED LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSE TO BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING (LPN-TO-BSN) PATHWAY TO IMPROVE THE DIVERSITY OF THE RN WORKFORCE IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS OF KENTUCKY. THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO:?  1) DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN INCREMENTAL, ACCELERATED LPN-TO-BSN EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY TO PREPARE LPNS FOR SUCCESS ON THE NCLEX-RN\u00a9 AND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT POST-GRADUATION.?  2) INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF THE RN WORKFORCE IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS IN KENTUCKY.?  3) GROW THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED DIVERSE NURSING FACULTY IN KENTUCKY.?  4) EXPAND ACADEMIC-CLINICAL PARTNERSHIPS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS.?   THIS GRANT WILL FUND THE: (1) CREATION OF AN INCREMENTAL, ACCELERATED LPN-TO-BSN PATHWAY, (2) ENHANCEMENT OF THE LPN-TO-BSN CURRICULUM, (3) RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF DIVERSE LPN-TO-BSN STUDENTS AND NURSING FACULTY, AND (4) FINANCIAL, ACADEMIC, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT FOR LPN-TO-BSN PATHWAY STUDENTS. THE PROGRAM IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE SCHOOL OF NURSING (ULSON) AND THE KENTUCKY COMMUNITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGE SYSTEM AND WILL ALIGN CURRICULA OF THE ESTABLISHED LPN-TO-RN BRIDGE PROGRAM AND THE RN-TO-BSN PROGRAM TO CREATE AN LPN-TO-BSN PATHWAY.   SITES: THE PROJECT FOCUS AREAS ARE: (1) MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED COUNTIES IN NORTH CENTRAL KENTUCKY, (2) RURAL SOUTHEASTERN KENTUCKY COUNTIES SERVED BY MOUNTAIN COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CORPORATION, AND (3) RURAL WESTERN KENTUCKY COUNTIES SERVED BY OWENSBORO HEALTH, INC.   NEED: THE US IS PROJECTED TO HAVE A SHORTAGE OF NEARLY 100,000 RNS BY 2025, WITH RURAL AREAS PROJECTED TO HAVE A LARGER SHORTAGE. DESPITE THIS NEED, ENROLLMENT IN KENTUCKY\u2019S ADN AND BSN PROGRAMS HAS DECLINED SINCE 2019 WITH AN ANTICIPATED REDUCTION OF NEW RNS ENTERING THE WORKFORCE. HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PURSUING LPN EDUCATION IS INCREASING, INDICATING INTEREST IN NURSING, BUT ALSO THE DESIRE FOR EXPEDITED WORKFORCE ENTRY.   RNS EDUCATED AT THE BACCALAUREATE LEVEL ARE BEST PREPARED TO PROVIDE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CARE, ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS. TO PREPARE THE RN WORKFORCE TO MEET THE COMPLEX HEALTH NEEDS OF KENTUCKY, EQUAL ACCESS TO RN TRAINING PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS PARAMOUNT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY CRUCIAL IN RURAL SETTINGS, WHERE THERE IS LIMITED ACCESS TO BSN PROGRAMS. WE WILL OFFER AN ACCELERATED LPN-TO-BSN PATHWAY IN RURAL, UNDERSERVED AREAS AND WILL ADDRESS THE ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, AND FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO STUDENT SUCCESS WITH A HOLISTIC SUPPORT PROGRAM.   TO ENSURE GRADUATES ARE PREPARED TO PROVIDE CARE FOR DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATIONS, THE CURRICULUM WILL FOCUS ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION THROUGH INFUSING PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH), HEALTH EQUITY, AND HEALTH LITERACY THROUGHOUT THE BSN PATHWAY.    METHODOLOGY: WE WILL DEVELOP RECRUITMENT MATERIALS THAT SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS WHO ARE DIVERSE OR ARE FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THE APPLICATION PROCESS WILL BE REVIEWED AND REVISED TO BE MORE HOLISTIC. FACULTY WILL BE TRAINED TO SUPPORT CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE STUDENTS. A SDOH CURRICULUM SPANNING THE FULL PROGRAM LENGTH WILL MOVE STUDENTS FROM FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO APPLICATION. THE SON\u2019S STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLINICAL PARTNERS WILL PROVIDE FOR RECRUITMENT OF DIVERSE STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND INCREASED CLINICAL PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN RURAL AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS. OUTCOMES MEASURES INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: NUMBER OF DIVERSE STUDENTS AND NEW FACULTY; PROGRAM COMPLETION RATE; STUDENT EXPERIENCE WITH MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS, AND PERCENTAGE OF GRADUATES WORKING IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS. WE REQUEST FUNDING PREFERENCE, \u201cQUALIFICATION 2: SUBSTANTIALLY BENEFIT UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS,\u201d AS CLINICAL EXPERIENCES WILL OCCUR AT SITES DESIGNATED AS MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3c9476c3-c39d-74de-31b6-2c9a10197e11-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UD749620_7526"}, {"internal_id": 160943738, "Award ID": "UD749619", "Award Amount": 999939.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-07-12", "CFDA Number": "93.359", "Description": "NURSE EDUCATION, PRACTICE, QUALITY, AND RETENTION -
