WITH THE OBLIGATION OF THIS INTERCITY BUS GRANT TDOT WILL COMPLETE THE OBLIGATION OF ALL CARES ACT FUNDING INTO ACTIVE GRANTS. TDOT CONDUCTED A SPECIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND CONSULTATION PROCESS OF TENNESSEE INTERCITY BUS PROVIDERS SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. TDOT PREVIOUSLY HAD DETERMINED THAT INTERCITY BUS NEEDS WERE MET AND THAT NO SET ASIDE WAS NEEDED OF REGULAR 5311 FUNDING. THE GOVERNOR HAD ISSUED A CERTIFICATION LETTER TO THAT EFFECT. PER GUIDANCE FOUND IN FAQS PROVIDED BY THE FTA (CA28) A STATE THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO ALLOCATE LESS THAN 15% TO INTERCITY BUS EXPENSES MUST UNDERGO A NEW CONSULTATION PROCESS SPECIFICALLY FOR CARES ACT FUNDS IF THE PRIOR CONSULTATION PROCESS CONCLUDED PRIOR TO APRIL 2 2020 WHEN THE FTA APPORTIONED THE CARES ACT FUNDS.

THE NETWORK LOSSES REPRESENT ELIGIBLE LOSSES CAPTURED WITHIN THE JD EDWARDS ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. AMOUNT BILLED TO EACH STATE IS BASED ON YTD NETWORK LOSSES LESS PRIOR PERIOD(S) CARES INCOME RECOGNIZED; DISTRIBUTED TO STATE BASED ON 2019 MILES FACTOR UNTIL THE CONTRACTED AWARDS ARE DEPLETED. CONTRACT START DATE VARIES BY STATE. MILLER TRANSPORTATION UTILIZES THE SAME BILLING STRUCTURE OUTLINED BY GREYHOUND. EACH SUBRECIPIENT USES A ROUTE MILE ALLOCATION FOR TENNESSEE THAT IS BASED ON THE COMPARISON OF MILES IN TENNESSEE TO THE TOTAL SYSTEM MILES DURING A STATED PERIOD. IN EACH CASE ONLY ACTUAL MILES AND EXPENSES WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR REIMBURSEMENT. INVOICE EXAMPLES FROM BOTH GREYHOUND AND MILLER TRANSPORTATION ARE ATTACHED TO THE GRANT AS APPLICATION DOCUMENTS.

THE PROPOSED QC - MUSCATINE RECIPROCAL EMPLOYEE COMMUTER SHUTTLE EXPANSION MAY BE SEEN AS THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP OF A TIMELY PROJECT. IT PROVIDES A DESIRED TRANSPORTATION OPTION TO COMMUTERS IN TWO URBAN AREAS PROVIDING GREATER CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS. ADDING THE MUSCATINE WORKER/QC EMPLOYER COMPONENT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THIS PROJECTS CURRENT CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICAAP GOALS OF MAXIMIZED TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY FEWER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD REDUCED EMISSIONS RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND HEALTHY AIR QUALITY AWARENESS/BEHAVIORS ALL VERY NEEDED IN A REGION STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN NON-ATTAINMENT STATUS.BECAUSE THIS PROJECT BUILDS UPON AN EXISTING PROJECT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED IN AN FTA GRANT MANY OF THE PROJECT DETAILS ALREADY IN PLACE WILL REMAIN THE SAME: 10 ROUND TRIPS WOULD STILL BE MADE BETWEEN PARKING SITES IN DAVENPORT TO EMPLOYMENT SITES IN MUSCATINE. THEN INCORPORATED INTO THIS FOR THE RETURN TRIPS WOULD BE PICKUPS AT MUSCATINE-BASED PARK-AND-RIDE LOT(S) OF RIDERS FOR THE COMMUTE TO THEIR QC JOB SITE. THE LEASE ON THE FOUR 25-PASSENGER GASOLINE FUELED LIGHT DUTY BUSES WOULD BE RENEWED FOR THIS PROJECT AS LEASING REMAINS A MORE COST EFFICIENT AND FLEXIBLE FLEET MANAGEMENT OPTION THAN ACQUIRING THE CAPITAL OUTLAY NECESSARY TO PURCHASE THE SAME. WITH RUNS BEING MADE AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING THE DAY TO ACCOMMODATE BEGINNING AND END OF SHIFTS TEN ROUND TRIPS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED USING JUST FOUR VEHICLES. EACH ROUND TRIP WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS OF DRIVER TIME WHICH INCLUDES THE TIME NECESSARY FOR PASSENGERS TO BOTH BOARD AND DEPART AT BOTH ENDS OF THE ROUTE. THE ROUND TRIP MILEAGE IS ESTIMATED TO BE 70 MILES WITH A TOTAL MILEAGE FOR ALL 10 ROUND TRIPS CALCULATING TO 700 SERVICE MILES DAILY. ADDITIONAL DEADHEAD MILES TO COVER ALL FOUR BUSES ARE ESTIMATED AT 70 MILES PER DAY TOTAL. THE DAILY SERVICE TIME WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 20 HOURS PER DAY WITH ACTUAL DRIVER TIME EXTENDED TO 23 HOURS PER DAY AS THIS MUST INCLUDE COMMUTE TIME FROM RIVER BEND TRANSIT OFFICE TO INITIAL PICK UP SITES THE END-OF-RUN RETURN MAINTENANCE NEEDS AND SUCH RELATED STANDARD PROCEDURES THAT DRIVERS PERFORM.EXACT HOURS OF SERVICE WILL BE SCHEDULED TO BEST ACCOMMODATE THE GREATEST NUMBER OF COMMUTERS MOST EFFICIENTLY AND RIVER BEND TRANSIT WILL COORDINATE WITH EMPLOYERS AS TO THE DICTATES OF SHIFT SCHEDULES; FIRST SHIFT WORKER SCHEDULES HOWEVER ARE THIS PROJECTS PRIMARY SERVICE TARGET WITH SECOND SHIFT SCHEDULE ACCOMMODATION THE SECONDARY SERVICE TARGET. PROJECT PARAMETERS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SERVICE FOR 253 DAYS RUNNING MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY FOR THE DURATION OF ONE YEAR. MAXIMUM RIDERSHIP CAPACITY FOR A FULLY UTILIZED RECIPROCAL SERVICE ARE: 25 RIDERS/ BUS 20 ONE-WAY (OR 10 ROUND TRIPS) RUNS/DAY EQUALS 500 RIDES PER DAY 2500 RIDES PER WORK WEEK. THE 20% LOCAL MATCH WILL BE COLLECTED VIA CONTRACTS WITH THE EMPLOYERS SIGNING ON FOR THE SERVICE AND IT WILL BE UP TO THEM IF THEY WISH TO COLLECT A FEE FROM EMPLOYEES VIA PAYROLL DEDUCTION OF SOME NATURE OR OFFER THE TRANSPORTATION SERVICE AS A COMPANY BENEFIT.BY AUGMENTING THIS SERVICE TO ADDITIONALLY TARGET MUSCATINE-BASED EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY COMMUTING DAILY TO THE QUAD CITIES FOR WORK THIS PROJECT CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES TOWARD REACHING THE GOAL OF MAXIMUM RIDERSHIP CAPACITY PARK RIDE LOCATION(S) IN MUSCATINE WILL BE SELECTED WITH PREFERENCE GIVEN TO THOSE WHICH ARE SITUATED ADJACENT TO EXISTING MUSCATINES FIXED ROUTE SERVICE FOR OPTIMUM COMMUTER CONVENIENCE.THOUGH TERMED AN EMPLOYEE COMMUTER SHUTTLE SERVICE IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE IS ALSO A MODEST DEMAND WITHIN THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR QC-MUSCATINE RECIPROCAL SERVICE. IN ORDER TO INFORM THE PUBLIC OF THIS SERVICE GENERAL PUBLIC ACCESS INFORMATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE PROMOTIONAL LITERATURE FARE AND TIME SCHEDULES WILL BE PRINTED FOR DISTRIBUTION AND INFORMATION WILL BE POSTED ON THE RIVER BEND TRANSIT WEBSITE. SINCE PARK AND RIDE LOT LOCATIONS WILL BE PROXIMAL TO ESTABLISHED FIXED ROUTES (MUSCABUS IN MUSCATINE/DAVENPORT CITIBUS AND BETTENDORF TRANSIT IN THE QUAD CITIES) THE SHUTTLE SERVICE CAN BE PROMOTED THROUGH THE FIXED ROUTE SYSTEMS MATERIALS AS WELL.REGION 12WESTERN IOWA TRANSIT SYSTEMS (REGION 12) PROPOSES TO INITIATE A REGIONAL VAN POOL PROJECT TO PROVIDE COMMUTER TRANSPORTATION SERVICE FOR ITS REGIONAL SERVICE AREA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO INTRODUCE ALTERNATIVE COMMUTER TRANSPORTATION MODES TO REDUCE SINGLE OCCUPANT VEHICLE TRIPS ALLEVIATE TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY CONDITIONS IN THE AREA. TRENDS IN TRAVEL PATTERNS INDICATE LONGER COMMUTES AND THE WILLINGNESS OF EMPLOYEES TO TRAVEL LONGER DISTANCES TO AND FROM EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THESE FACTORS MAKE VAN POOLING MORE FEASIBLE. THE WITS VANPOOL PROGRAMS IS AIMED AT: 1) REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SINGLE-OCCUPANT VEHICLES ON ROADWAYS; 2) IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT; 3) ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO LIVE OUTSIDE URBAN AREAS; 4) AND PROVIDING A LARGER HIRING AREA FOR EMPLOYERS. WHILE THE WITS VAN POOL PROGRAM WILL HOPEFULLY GROW TO A REGION WIDE SERVICE THIS PROJECT WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE LARGER SCALE EMPLOYMENT CENTERS IN CARROLL CRAWFORD AND GREENE COUNTIES. INITIALLY MARKETING AND PLANNING EFFORTS WILL BE FOCUSED ON VANPOOLING. VANPOOLS REQUIRE A MORE FORMAL COMMITMENT THAN CARPOOLS BUT ALSO HAVE GREATER EFFECTIVENESS IN IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND MITIGATING TRAFFIC CONGESTION. THE INITIAL PROJECT WILL REQUIRE 5 EXPANSION VEHICLES. WITS WILL UTILIZE EXISTING PARATRANSIT VEHICLES FOR EMPLOYEES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND TO PROVIDE ADA ACCESSIBILITY WHEN NECESSARY.REGION 12 WILL ALSO RECRUIT QUALIFIED DRIVERS TO OPERATE EACH VANPOOL. THE VOLUNTEER DRIVERS WILL RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF NO-COST TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM WORK FOR OPERATING THE VANPOOL. THEY WILL MARKET THE PROJECT TO EMPLOYEES WORKING AT LARGE MULTI-SHIFT EMPLOYERS SUCH AS PELLA CORPORATION FARMLAND AND FARNER BOCKEN WHO DRAW EMPLOYEES FROM OUTSIDE THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY OR COUNTY.

IN ADDITION AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT IS ADVANCING TO PROTECT OUR CURRENT ASSETS EXPAND OUR SERVICES AND INCREASE RIDERSHIP WITH THE PURCHASE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A LOW LINE PASSENGER BUS CIRCULAR ROUTE SIGNAGE AND A SHADE STRUCTURE FOR THE FLEET.PROJECT STATEMENT OF WORK: AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2016. UPON STARTUP A TRANSIT MANGER AND DRIVERS WERE HIRED AND TRANSIT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WERE CREATED APPROVED AND IMPLEMENTED. AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT HAS BEEN OFFERING A FIXED CIRCULAR ROUTE FOR RESIDENTS THAT PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION WITHIN AK-CHIN AND THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY OF MARICOPA. IN ADDITION WE ALSO PROVIDE ON-DEMAND CURB TO CURB SERVICES AS WELL.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: LOW LINE BUS - AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT CURRENTLY HAS A FLEET OF SIX FOURTEEN-PASSENGER BUSES AND DOES NOT HAVE A PASSENGER BUS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING APPROPRIATE AND SAFE MOBILE SERVICES TO PASSENGERS THAT ARE SEMI-AMBULATORY. OUR FLEET CAN ACCOMMODATE AMBULATORY AND NON-AMBULATORY PASSENGERS. WE ARE IN CRITICAL NEED FOR A PASSENGER VEHICLE THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE OUR SENIOR CITIZENS AND THOSE WITH LIMITED PHYSICAL MOBILITY WHICH IS FOCUSING ON OUR SEMI-AMBULATORY POPULATION. OUR SEMI AMBULATORY POPULATION IS 21% WE CURRENTLY TRANSPORT 3-4%. TRANSIT WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE A LOW LINE MOBILITY BUS. THE FRONT OF THE BUS WILL HAVE A RAMP FOR SAFE ACCESSIBILITY FOR PASSENGERS THAT CANNOT ASCEND OR DESCEND STAIRS. THIS BUS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR CURRENT OPERATING STRUCTURE WITH THE REST OF OUR TRANSIT FLEET AND COMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE OUR CURRENT SERVICES. A LOW LINE BUS IS ESSENTIAL IN OUR COMMUNITY. MOST OF OUR ELDERLY POPULATION IN THE COMMUNITY FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF LOW TO MODERATE INCOME. TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS ARE LIMITED AND THE CURRENT CLOSEST BUSINESS THAT PROVIDES THIS SERVICE IS IN EXCESS OF THIRTY MILES AWAY ONE WAY. ROUTE SIGNAGE - AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT WAS INCORPORATED IN 2016. FIXED ROUTES IN ADDITION TO ON-DEMAND SERVICES ARE OFFERED TO AK-CHIN INDIAN COMMUNITY AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY OF MARICOPA. AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW OF SURVEYS AND COMMUNITY FEEDBACK WE HAVE RECOGNIZED OUR PRESENCE AT MANY LOCATIONS IS CONFUSING TO OUR COMMUNITY AND UNCLEAR. AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT IS CURRENTLY VISITING STOPS AT LOCATIONS THAT HAVE NO SIGNAGE DESIGNATION OR NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT WOULD LIKE TO INSTALL THIRTY-THREE SIGNS PLACED AROUND THE COMMUNITY TO REMEDY THESE CONCERNS AND ENCOURAGE RIDERSHIP TO THRIVE. RADIO EQUIPMENT- OUR MOBILE AND STATIONARY EQUIPMENT IS IN FAIR OPERATING CONDITION AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. OF THE FIVE REMAINING FUNCTIONING UNITS TWO ARE AT LIMITED LIFE REMAINING DUE TO EXTENSIVE USE AND THOSE BATTERIES FUNCTION AT APPROXIMATELY 25% OF LIFE. OUR MODEL RADIOS HAVE BEEN PHASED OUT AND REPLACEMENT EQUIPMENT IS UNOBTAINABLE. TWO OTHER UNITS IN THE BUSES ALSO SHOW SIGNS OF WEAR AND ARE IN FAIR CONDITION DUE TO USE AND BEING MOUNTED IN FULL SUN. WE EXPERIENCE INTERMITTENT RADIO TRANSMISSIONS AND LONG WAIT TIMES BEFORE A SIGNAL PICKS UP AGAIN TO ALLOW US TO TRANSMIT. AFTER EVERY TRANSMISSION WE MUST WAIT 8-15 SECONDS BEFORE THE RADIO CAN BE TRANSMITTED ON. CONTINUOUS TRANSMISSIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH. FULL SUPPORT FROM OUR COMMUNITY COUNCIL WAS OBTAINED TO MOVE FORWARD IN RECTIFYING OUR CURRENT TRANSIT COMMUNICATION SETBACKS. OUR CURRENT SETBACKS INCLUDE LIMITED HANDHELD RADIO EQUIPMENT TO EFFICIENTLY PROVIDE SERVICES. THE TRANSIT DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT 50% DUE TO A MOBILE RADIO SHORTAGE. OF SIX BUSES FOUR BUSES CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. TRANSIT UTILIZES MOBILE RADIOS IN THESE VEHICLES AND AS A RESULT OF THE SHORTAGE DRIVERS ARE USING MOBILE PHONES WHEN STOPPED AND IN A SAFE LOCATION. PENDING FULL REPLACEMENT TRANSIT HAS COORDINATED WITH LOCAL DEPARTMENTS FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE AND USE OF THEIR EQUIPMENT. THEIR PARTICIPATION HAS LED TO PROLONGING THE LIFE OF OUR EQUIPMENT. BULLETIN BOARDS - FIVE YEARS AGO BUS STOP SHELTERS WERE CONSTRUCTED IN SEVENTEEN LOCATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE AMENITIES PROVIDED AT THE SHELTER WAS A CLEAR SWING-FRAME BULLETIN BOARD. THE REPLACEMENT OF THESE BOARDS IS IDEAL FOR THE CONTINUED SUPPORT TO THOSE WHO HAVE NO ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. WITHOUT REPLACEMENT TRANSIT IS UNABLE TO CONVEY TO THE PUBLIC ROUTE INFORMATION EVENTS SERVICES MEETINGS AND CDC GUIDANCE. BUS SHADE STRUCTURES - AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT -CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT IS SEEKING A SHADE STRUCTURE FOR OUR FLEET OF VEHICLES. THIS SHADE WILL SERVE SEVERAL PURPOSES IN OUR ARIZONA DESERT CLIMATE.

INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: LOW LINE BUS - THE ADDITION OF THIS VEHICLE WILL ALLOW AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT TO PROVIDE SERVICES OTHERWISE NOT PROVIDED TO OUR RESIDENTS WITH LIMITED MOBILITY. THIS BUS WILL IMPACT THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE COMMUNITY BY ENCOURAGING INDEPENDENCE IN OUR LIMITED MOBILITY POPULATION. TRANSIT IS ANTICIPATING RIDERSHIP TO GROW WITH THE ADDITION OF FOUR PEOPLE AT MINIMUM A DAY UTILIZING THIS SERVICE FOR SHORT DISTANCE TRAVEL AND TWO PEOPLE MINIMUM PER DAY FOR LONG RANGE TRAVEL. THESE SERVICES ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED BY AN OUTSIDE SOURCE AND THE ADDITION OF THIS VEHICLE TO OUR FLEET WILL ALLOW TRANSIT TO OFFER THOSE SERVICES. THIS VEHICLE WILL OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL DESTINATIONS CURRENTLY NOT OFFERED TO LIMITED MOBILITY PASSENGERS SUCH AS HEALTHCARE SHOPPING AND OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES NEEDED FOR DAY TO DAY LIFE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE COMMUNING AND ADJACENT CITY. ROUTE SIGNAGE - THE INSTALLATION OF SIGNAGE WE PREDICT WILL OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INCREASED RIDERSHIP AND ATTENDANCE ON THE ROUTES DUE TO FOOT TRAFFIC AT IDENTIFIED LOCATIONS.

THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED OUR RIDERSHIP DUE TO CDC GUIDELINES AND SOCIAL DISTANCING HOWEVER OUR ANNUAL RIDERSHIP FROM JULY OF 2020 TO JULY 2021 WAS 5275 PASSENGERS. SOME RESIDENTS INFORM US OF THEIR INTENT TO BOARD AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION FOR THE ROUTE AND UPON ARRIVAL THE PASSENGER IS NOT THERE. WE FEEL THAT SIGNAGE WILL HELP TO ELIMINATE THESE EVENTS.RADIO EQUIPMENT - THE REPLACEMENT OF EQUIPMENT WILL IMPROVE OUR SERVICE OPERATIONS. TIMELY TRANSMISSION VIA RADIO REGARDING CURRENT AND POTENTIAL PASSENGERS WILL BE MORE EFFICIENT FOR OUR SERVICE OPERATIONS. DRIVER-TO-DIVER COMMUNICATION AS WELL AS CUSTOMER SERVICE WOULD BOTH BE GREATLY IMPROVED WITH AN UPDATED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.

INCREASED INFO AT SHELTERS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR BOTH RESIDENTS AND NON-RESIDENTS ENSURING 24-HOUR ACCESS TO VITAL COMMUNITY INFO. INDIVIDUALS FROM SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES CAN ALSO BENEFIT FROM THIS IMPORTANT INFO. BUS SHADE STRUCTURES - ACHIEVE BENEFITS WOULD INCLUDE EXTENDED LIFE OF EXTERIOR VEHICLE COMPONENTS INCLUDING WRAP TIRES LENS COVERS WIPERS TOP AIR CONDITIONING UNITS TO NAME A FEW. TRANSIT WOULD LIKE TO OFFER ENHANCED INTERIOR COMFORT ON THE BUS UPON ARRIVAL TO BOARD PASSENGERS. THE SEAT AND GRAB-RAIL TEMPERATURES WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AND NO LONGER PROVE TO BE A SAFETY HAZARD CONCERNING SENIOR CITIZENS AND OTHER RESIDENTS WHO WOULD NEED TO UTILIZE ASSISTANCE FEATURES TO BOARD THE VEHICLE. SEAT BELTS WOULD REMAIN A SAFE TEMPERATURE AS WELL. BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE COMFORTABLE TRANSIT VEHICLES TO THE COMMUNITY WOULD PROMOTE RIDERSHIP AND SERVE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE TO THOSE UTILIZING OUR SERVICES. ALL RESIDENTS AND THOSE WITH MOBILITY CONCERNS WOULD NO LONGER FEEL THE NEED TO REFUSE OR SETTLE FOR UNCOMFORTABLE TRANSPORTATION. IN THE YEAR 2020 THE SUMMER MONTHS RESULTED IN A 47% DECREASE OF PASSENGERS COMPARED TO THE WINTER MONTHS. AK-CHIN TRIBAL TRANSIT CURRENTLY OPERATES ON AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF 259555.00.
