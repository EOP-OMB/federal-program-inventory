MORE INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE SERVING LIFE IN LOUISIANA THAN IN TEXAS, ARKANSAS, MISSISSIPPI, ALABAMA AND TENNESSEE COMBINED. (FOOTNOTE 1)\n\nTHIS PRESSING NEED LED TO A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN INNOCENCE PROJECT NEW ORLEANS (IPNO) AND THE PAUL M.

THE WCC BEGAN OPERATIONS IN 2021 AND HAS NOW COMPLETED TWO SEMESTERS AT LSU LAW WITH IPNO STAFF WORKING ON CASES WITH SIX LAW STUDENTS PER SEMESTER.\n\nTHIS POSTCONVICTION TESTING OF DNA EVIDENCE GRANT WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF THE FIRST AND ONLY WRONGFUL CONVICTION CLINIC. BASED ON THE CASEWORK PROCESSES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND BUILT SINCE JANUARY 2021, THE CLINIC ESTIMATES THAT WITH BJA\u2019S CONTINUED SUPPORT IT CAN WORK UP AT LEAST EIGHTEEN CASES IN JUDICIAL DISTRICTS ACROSS LOUISIANA AND LOCATE TESTABLE EVIDENCE AND COMPLETE TESTING IN AT LEAST EIGHT CASES.\n\nTHE NEED FOR POST-CONVICTION DNA TESTING IS GREAT. LOUISIANA\u2019S VAST POPULATION OF LIFE SENTENCED INCARCERATED PEOPLE MEAN THERE ARE PEOPLE STILL INNOCENT PEOPLE IN PRISON BASED ON CONVICTIONS FROM DECADES BEFORE FORENSIC DNA TESTING WAS POSSIBLE. AND, ADVANCES IN DNA TECHNOLOGY MEAN THAT, EVEN IN RELATIVELY RECENT CASES, CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY CAN PRODUCE NEW EVIDENCE OF INNOCENCE. IN FACT, THE LAST THREE EXONERATIONS INVOLVING NEW DNA TESTING WERE IN CASES TRIED WITHIN THE LAST TWELVE YEARS, WITH PROBATIVE RESULTS PRODUCED FROM ZIP TIES, THE VICTIM\u2019S T-SHIRT, AND THE PERPETRATOR\u2019S GLOVE.\n\nIPNO AND LSU LAW HAVE BUILT THE CLINIC\u2014A NEW ENTITY WITH THE CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THIS NEED FOR DNA TESTING.
