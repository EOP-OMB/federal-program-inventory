DUE TO MORE THAN A CENTURY OF HABITAT DESTRUCTION, SPREAD OF INVASIVE SPECIES, AND DECLINE OF POLLINATORS AND SEED DISPERSERS, HAWAII IS NOW HOME TO 400 ENDANGERED PLANT SPECIES. HAWAII CONSERVATION MANAGERS HAVE SPENT THE LAST TWO DECADES PUTTING ENORMOUS EFFORT INTO TRYING TO REVERSE THIS SITUATION BY REINTRODUCING THOUSANDS OF RARE PLANTS INTO NEW SITES WITHIN PROTECTED FORESTS. TODAY HOWEVER, AS CLIMATE CHANGE SHIFTS PATTERNS OF TEMPERATURE, RAINFALL AND INTERACTIONS AMONG SPECIES, THE ABILITY OF REINTRODUCED POPULATIONS TO PERSIST OVER THE LONG-TERM IS UNKNOWN. SIMILARLY, MANAGERS DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY WHICH SITES MIGHT BE MOST SUITABLE FOR FUTURE RARE PLANT REINTRODUCTIONS.

PLANT SPECIES ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK BECAUSE THEY DISPERSE SLOWLY ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. TO FACILITATE PLANT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE, CONSERVATION MANAGERS SEEK TO PLANT SPECIES ADAPTED TO FUTURE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, CONSERVATION MANAGERS RARELY HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH NATIVE SPECIES ARE BEST ADAPTED TO CLIMATE CHANGE WITHIN THEIR MANAGEMENT AREAS. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP BY PROVIDING CONSERVATION MANAGERS WITH SITE-SPECIFIC LISTS OF CLIMATE-ADAPTED PLANT SPECIES. IT WILL SYNTHESIZE A NEW SPATIAL DATASET CONTAINING SPECIES COMPOSITION INFORMATION FROM THOUSANDS OF PLANT COMMUNITIES WITH THE LATEST SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELING ADVANCES TO IDENTIFY SETS OF NATIVE PLANT SPECIES PREDICTED TO MAINTAIN THEIR ABUNDANCE UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE (SO CALLED, CLIMATE-SMART SPECIES).

HOWEVER, CHANGING CLIMATIC CONDITIONS MAY ALSO INCREASE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DISEASE AND INVASIVE SPECIES, BOTH OF WHICH THREATEN AT-RISK AMPHIBIANS IN THE PNW. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH AMPHIBIAN SPECIES ARE MOST AT RISK FROM CLIMATE CHANGE, DISEASE, AND INVASIVE BULLFROGS, AND WHICH AREAS MAY REPRESENT REFUGES FROM THESE THREATS. IN ADDITION, THIS PROJECT WILL HELP STATE AND FEDERAL WILDLIFE AGENCIES DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR SPECIES CONSERVATION THAT ARE UNIQUELY SUITED TO THE MOST PROMINENT THREATS TO EACH SPECIES. THUS, THIS PROJECT WILL IMPROVE CLIMATE RESILIENCE FOR THESE THREATENED AND UNIQUE SPECIES, SO THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN THEIR IMPORTANT ROLE IN PACIFIC NORTHWEST ECOSYSTEMS.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: FOR 14 AT-RISK AMPHIBIAN SPECIES FROM THROUGHOUT THE PNW THIS PROJECT WILL: 1) PREDICT CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED ALTERATIONS IN HABITAT SUITABILITY, 2) EVALUATE CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED SHIFTS IN DISEASE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMPHIBIAN CHYTRID PATHOGENS AND RANAVIRUS, 3) EVALUATE CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED SHIFTS IN RISKS OF INVASIVE AMERICAN BULLFROG, 4) CREATE MAPS IDENTIFYING HABITATS AND POPULATIONS AT HIGH RISK OF CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES IN HABITAT SUITABILITY, DISEASE, AND BULLFROG INVASION, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL REFUGIA FROM THESE THREATS, AND 5) DEVELOP A SET OF SPECIES AND HABITAT-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS THAT MAY REDUCE CLIMATE-DRIVEN RISK.DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES INCLUDE SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS, TECHNICAL AND PUBLIC FACT SHEETS, REPORTS, AND DATA PRODUCTS SUCH AS MAPS OF RISK AND UPDATED PATHOGEN OCCURRENCE DATA. THESE WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH USGS'S SCIENCEBASE AND OTHER PLATFORMS.

SOUTHWESTERN FORESTS ARE VITAL FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, RECREATION, CLEAN WATER, AND MANY OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES BUT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY MEGA-FIRES IN RECENT DECADES. IN SOME PLACES, INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS GRAZING, TIMBER PRODUCTION, AND FIRE SUPPRESSION HAS RESULTED IN EITHER A LACK OF FIRE OR FIRES THAT ARE UNCHARACTERISTICALLY FREQUENT OR SEVERE. THESE CHANGES HAVE MARKED CONSEQUENCES FOR ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION, ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, LOCAL HUMAN ECONOMIES, AND THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF WILDLIFE AND VEGETATION COMMUNITIES. FIRES CAN REDUCE DENSE WOODY BIOMASS AND CREATE LIGHT AND NUTRIENT CONDITIONS NEEDED TO SUPPORT COMPLEX FOOD WEBS THAT WILDLIFE DEPEND ON. TO BETTER MANAGE OUR FORESTS, THE MAIN GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW RECENT FIRES HAVE AFFECTED VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE BY ASSESSING FIRE IMPACTS IN A HISTORICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONTEXT. DOING SO WILL REQUIRE MODELS BASED ON REMOTE SENSING AND FIELD DATA, WHICH THE PROJECT TEAM WILL GATHER AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES ACROSS THE SKY ISLANDS REGION AND MOGOLLON PLATEAU. THIS WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON CLIMATE, TOPOGRAPHY, VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION, AND WILDLIFE. A GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS WILDFIRE INCREASES HABITAT AVAILABILITY FOR VARIOUS BIRD SPECIES THAT EACH DEPEND ON DIFFERENT SETS OF RESOURCES AND CONDITIONS. BIRDS ARE EXCELLENT ECOLOGICAL INDICTORS DUE TO THEIR LINKAGES TO SPECIFIC RESOURCES AND CONDITIONS THAT PROVIDE FORAGING AND NESTING REQUIREMENTS.

ANTHROPOGENIC NUTRIENT SOURCES; THIS COULD INDICATE A DIFFERENCE IN THE, TYPICALLY, NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF NUTRIENTS ON CORALS OR A DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECTS OF ZOOPLANKTON AVAILABILITY, AND FURTHER EXPLORATION IS NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW NATURAL NUTRIENT SUBSIDIES SUPPORT REEF RESILIENCE.THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE THE RESPONSE OF CORALS TO DIFFERENT NUTRIENT SOURCES WITH AND WITHOUT HETEROTROPHIC FEEDING. WHILE THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON THE EFFECTS OF NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT TO CORALS, THERE IS A GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DIFFERENT NUTRIENT SOURCES (NATURAL VS. ANTHROPOGENIC) AFFECT CORAL HEALTH AND RESILIENCE. A SECONDARY CONSERVATION GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO TEST IF THIS NATURAL NUTRIENT PATHWAY CAN BE SIMULATED USING OTHER, AVAILABLE RESOURCES, SUCH AS DISCARDED FISH WASTE FROM COMMERCIAL FISHING ACTIVITIES. THE FISH WASTE WILL BE RENDERED INTO A SOLUTION AND TESTED AS A NATURAL NUTRIENT REPLACEMENT FOR GUANO, AS SEABIRD POPULATIONS ARE IN DECLINE, AND GUANO IS NOT AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE.THE PROJECT TEAM WILL ACCLIMATE REPLICATE CORAL FRAGMENTS FROM MULTIPLE COLONIES (TO CONTROL FOR GENOTYPE) TO AMBIENT OR THREE NUTRIENT ADDITION TREATMENTS (+SEABIRD GUANO, +FISH SOLUTION, CONTROLLING FOR TOTAL N) FOR 4 WEEKS, EACH WITH AND WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF ARTEMIA AS A HETEROTROPHIC FOOD SOURCE. THE CORALS WILL THEN BE EXPOSED TO A 4-WEEK THERMAL STRESS EVENT, FOLLOWED BY A 4-WEEK RECOVERY PERIOD TO CHARACTERIZE RESILIENCE TO BLEACHING, AND CORAL FRAGMENTS OF EACH GENOTYPE X TREATMENT WILL BE COLLECTED AT THE END OF THE ACCLIMATION PERIOD, AT THE END OF THE BLEACHING PERIOD, AND AT THE END OF THE RECOVERY PERIOD. WE WILL MEASURE CORAL SURVIVAL, GROWTH, TISSUE CONDITION, AND ENDOSYMBIONT DENSITY AS METRICS FOR CORAL RESILIENCE. CORALS HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCORPORATE NUTRIENTS BY DIRECT UPTAKE FROM THE WATER AND FROM THE FOOD THEY EAT. STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS OF THE CORALS, THEIR ENDOSYMBIONTS, AND THE ARTEMIA WILL INDICATE IF THE CORALS ARE SWITCHING FROM AUTOTROPHIC TO HETEROTROPHIC FEEDING DURING THE EXPERIMENT.PROJECT BENEFICIARIES: PROJECT ACTIVITIES WILL BENEFIT AGENCIES AND REEF MANAGERS THAT ARE ACTIVELY MANAGING PACIFIC CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC.SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: N/A", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "HI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7997b0e4-1373-a617-5e8b-0e0e80c459d7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_G22AC00343_1434"}, {"internal_id": 149742588, "Award ID": "G22AC00333", "Award Amount": 64724.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-06-28", "CFDA Number": "15.820", "Description": "PROJECT TITLE: CLIMATE MICROAPPS - ASSESSMENT AND INNOVATION IN CLIMATE DECISION SUPPORT TOOLSPROJECT DATES: 9/1/2022 - 8/31/2023AWARD DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES):: THE QUANTITY AND AVAILABILITY OF WEATHER- AND CLIMATE-RELATED DATA HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST DECADE DUE IN PART TO IMPROVEMENTS IN COMPUTING SPEED, INTERNET BANDWIDTH AND DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS.
