RESEARCH ACTIVITIES IN TSU FORESTRY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.  IN FORESTS, RECRUITMENT PATTERNS OF TREE SPECIES SHAPE THE DIVERSITY, STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE ECOSYSTEM FOR ENSUING DECADES. UNTIL NOW, WELL-STUDIED SUCCESSIONAL DYNAMICS HAVE ALLOWED US TO PREDICT THE NATURAL CHAIN OF EVENTS IN TERMS OF SHORT-TERM DYNAMICS AFTER DISTURBANCES. HOWEVER, THE COMBINATION OF CHANGES IN CLIMATE, DISTURBANCE REGIMES, LAND USE, NATURAL ENEMY POPULATIONS, AND THE INCREASE OF INVASIVE SPECIES HAVE RESULTED IN RAPID SHIFTS IN SPECIES COMPOSITION OF HARDWOOD FORESTS ACROSS EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. THE EFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE IN OAK-DOMINATED FORESTS. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH AT TSU IS TO BETTER ASCERTAIN THE RELATIVELY LONG-TERM CHANGES IN SPECIES COMPOSITION AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND MECHANISMS OF SPECIES COEXISTENCE IN OAK-HICKORY DOMINANT CUMBERLAND PLATEAU FORESTS SINCE THE 1970S. THIS WORK IS CRITICAL SINCE, WITH CURRENT GLOBAL TRENDS, THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND ANY POTENTIAL OUTCOME BASED ON CLASSICAL SUCCESSIONAL THEORY AND PAST RECORDS HAS BEEN MAGNIFIED. THE TARGET AUDIENCE MAY INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, FORESTERS, RESEARCHERS, EXTENSION AGENTS, AND THE PUBLIC. THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT BY BETTER UNDERSTANDING LONG-TERM FOREST COMMUNITY DYNAMICS FOR UPLAND CUMBERLAND PLATEAU FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. TO THE BEST OF KNOWLEDGE, THERE ARE NO OTHER COMPARABLE LONG-TERM, MAPPED FOREST STANDS OF THIS ECOSYSTEM AVAILABLE.  URBAN FORESTS CAN PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF TANGIBLE GOODS PRODUCTION AND INTANGIBLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS PRODUCING FOOD, CLEANING THE AIR, MITIGATING THE URBAN HEATISLAND EFFECT, SEQUESTERING CARBON, REDUCING STORMWATER RUNOFF, CREATING GREEN JOBS, PROVIDING WILDLIFE HABITAT AND BIODIVERSITY, AND IMPROVING HUMAN HEALTH AND WELLBEING. TO REHABILITATE COMPACTED URBAN SOILS IN PLACE TO BETTER SUIT URBAN FORESTS AND ENHANCE LONG-TERM ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, THE RESEARCHERS HAVE DEVELOPED SOIL PROFILE REBUILDING (SPR), WHICH IS A TECHNIQUE THAT INCORPORATES SUBSOILING, COMPOST AMENDMENT, AND TREE PLANTING. HOWEVER, THIS TECHNIQUE HAS NOT BEEN USED AND EVALUATED IN TENNESSEE, AND ITS LONG-TERM IMPACTS ON TREE GROWTH AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED YET. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT AT TSU IS TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF SPR ON URBAN SOIL QUALITY (E.G., SOIL BULK DENSITY), TREE ESTABLISHMENT AND GROWTH, AND LONG-TERM ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (E.G., CARBON SEQUESTRATION). THE TARGET AUDIENCE MAY INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, URBAN FORESTERS, ARBORISTS, RESEARCHERS, URBAN PLANNERS, EXTENSION AGENTS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT BY BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE BENEFITS OF SOIL BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR URBAN FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. THEY CAN ALSO UTILIZE SPR AND OTHER SOIL BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO IMPROVE THEIR URBAN FORESTS AND ENHANCE LONG-TERM ECOSYSTEM SERVICE PROVISION.  THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF THE LONGLEAF PINE ECOSYSTEM ONCE RANGED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHEAST COASTAL PLAIN OF THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES IN LARGE CONTIGUOUS FOREST TRACTS THAT TOTALED 24 MILLION HECTARES. HOWEVER, A COMBINATION OF FIRE SUPPRESSION, ANTHROPOGENIC DEVELOPMENT, AND HABITAT CONVERSION, HAS LED TO THE OVERALL DECLINE OF THE LONGLEAF PINE ECOSYSTEM. AS THESE FOREST TYPES HAVE DECLINED, SO TOO HAVE THE UNIQUE PLANT AND ANIMAL COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ADAPTED TO THE GROWING CONDITIONS IN THESE ECOSYSTEMS. ONE PARTICULAR ANIMAL GROUP (AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES) ARE ESPECIALLY TIED TO LARGE, INTACT STANDS OF LONGLEAF PINE AND THE BIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE PRESENTWITHIN THESE ECOSYSTEMS. THIS PROPOSED WORK WILL ADVANCE THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF VERTEBRATE SPECIES CONSERVATION BY EVALUATING THE ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF LONGLEAF PINE FOREST RESTORATION IN A PORTION OF THE RANGE OF THE LONGLEAF PINE ECOSYSTEM THAT HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED PREVIOUSLY. THE RESEARCHERS WILL USE A LARGE-SCALE REPLICATED FIELD STUDY TO EVALUATE THE IMPACTS OF LONGLEAF PINE RESTORATION ON AMPHIBIAN AND REPTILE COMMUNITIES. THIS STUDY WILL FURTHER THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW RESTORATION LEADS TO CHANGES IN AMPHIBIAN AND REPTILE COMMUNITIES, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL GIVEN THE GLOBAL DECLINE OF THIS SPECIES GROUP. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THIS DECLINING ECOSYSTEM AND THE ORGANISMS THAT INHABIT THESE LANDSCAPES. ONLY BY UNDERSTANDING THE UNIQUE CONDITIONS THAT THESE HABITATS PRESENT, WILL WE BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE - AND THUS THE NEED TO RESTORE THESE ECOSYSTEMS. A WELL-BALANCED FOREST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONCEIVABLY CONTRIBUTES BETTER LIVELIHOODS FORLOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE FOREST INDUSTRY, WHILE ALSO CONTRIBUTING SUSTAINABLE SOURCES FOR GREEN ENERGY. ANOTHER PROJECT AT TSU PRIMARILY AIMS TO ADDRESS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF FOREST  ECOSYSTEM, THE FOREST PRODUCTIVITY AND ITS SUSTAINABILITY. THE ANTICIPATED OUTPUTS FROM THE PROJECT ARE PREDICTIVE MAPS OF STAND-LEVEL FOREST ATTRIBUTES, WHICH DOES NOT ONLY HELP TO PLAN A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF TRADITIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS, E.G. TIMBER AND PULP, AND NEW BIOPRODUCTS SUCH AS BIOMASS FOR BIOENERGY FROM THE FOREST, BUT ALSO HELPS TO STRATEGICALLY MANAGE THE FOREST FOR MULTI-VALUE FOREST PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO GENERATE REVENUE AND PROTECT AND RESTORE SUPPORTING SERVICES IN THE FORESTS THROUGH SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI HAS 19.7 MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND, WITH 125,000 FOREST LANDOWNERS, AND FORESTRY CONTRIBUTING TO $1393 MILLION IN 2017. FORESTRY CONTINUES TO BE THE SECOND LARGEST REVENUE CONTRIBUTOR, NEXT ONLY TO POULTRY PRODUCTION IN MISSISSIPPI. FOREST COVER IS SEEN IN MORE THAN 60% OF THE STATE AND 72% OF THIS LAND IS PRIVATELY OWNED. HARDWOODS ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 50% OF MISSISSIPPI'S LIVE TREE VOLUME AND LOBLOLLY PINE (PINUS TAEDA), SWEETGUM (LIQUIDAMBAR STYRACIFLUA) AND WATER OAK (QUERCUS NIGRA) ARE MOST ABUNDANT IN MISSISSIPPI. WOOD SHAVINGS, SAWDUST, WOOD CHIPS AND BARK ARE PRODUCTS OF MILLING AND IN 2011 MISSISSIPPI MILLS PRODUCED 203 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF WOOD RESIDUE, WITH WOOD CHIPS ACCOUNTING FOR 41 PE RCENT OF RESIDUES, 25% SAWDUST AND 7% WOOD SHAVINGS RESPECTIVELY. MISSISSIPPI UTILIZES ALL THE FORESTRY RESIDUES AND IN 2011, 77% OF SAWDUST AND SHAVINGS WERE USED AS INDUSTRIAL FUEL.

THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CONDUCT INDOOR CULTIVATION OF SPECIALTY MUSHROOM (SHIITAKE; LENTINUS EDODES) ON FORESTRY PRODUCTS LIKE SAWDUST AND WOOD CHIPS. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT AIMS ARE I) TO DEVELOP A YEAR-ROUND, PILOT SCALE INDOOR SHIITAKE CU LTIVATION ON GROW- BLOCKS (SYNTHETIC LOGS) AT THE MUSHROOM FACILITY AT THE ALCORN AGRICULTURE EXPERIMENT STATION, LORMAN, MS FOR DEMONSTRATION TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS MAINLY SMALL AND RESOURCE LIMITED FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS; II) TO EVALUATE THE YIELD AND NUTRITIONAL C OMPOSITION OF SHIITAKE CULTIVATED ON TRADITIONAL RECIPE OF SAWDUST/WHOLE-LOG CHIP, GRAIN AND/OR BRAN AND COMPARE THEM TO THE USDA NUTRIENT DATABASE; AND III) TO CALIBRATE THE PILOT-SCALE SHIITAKE CULTIVATION BASED ON LOCAL AVAILABILITY OF FORESTRY PRODUCTS FOR SUS TAINED SHIITAKE PRODUCTION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MS", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0a2ee625-25cb-fa2b-afa1-6805c65410c6-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23MSCFRXXXG073_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735954, "Award ID": "NI23MSCFRXXXG072", "Award Amount": 118305.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.202", "Description": "HUMAN SOCIETIES HAVE A TENDENCY OF PLACING INCREASING VALUE ON LEISURE TIME, RESULTING IN INCREASED DEMAND FOR RECREATIONAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC LANDS. HUMAN PERCEPTIONS OF THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE BENEFITS THAT FOREST LANDSCAPES PROVIDE HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED EXCLUSIVELY IN KENTUCKY PUBLIC LANDS. IN GENERAL, PUBLIC LANDS, SUCH AS NATIONAL FORESTS, PROVIDE IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL, CULTURAL, AND ECONOMIC SERVICES THAT INCLUDE BIODIVERSITY, TIMBER PRODUCTION, AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. FOREST RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES CAN CONSIST OF HUNTING, FISHING, HIKING, WALKING, CAMPING, CYCLING, HORSEBACK RIDING, SIGHTSEEING, ETC. GROWING DEMANDS FOR FOREST RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES HAVE RESULTED IN THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND DEMOGRAPHIC AND SPATIAL DIMENSIONS OF VISITORS' ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS VALUING RECREATIONAL RESOURCES AND ECOLOGICAL SERVICES OF PUBLIC LANDS. HIGH LEVELS OF FOREST RECREATIONAL USE CAN ENDANGER THE ECOLOGICAL STATUS OF FORESTS. A RECENT MEETING BETWEEN KENTUCKY STATE UNIVERSITY AND PERSONNEL FROM THE DANIEL BOONE NATIONAL FOREST, STATE FORESTERS, AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES SHOWED INCREASED INTEREST IN THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS AND USE OF PUBLIC LANDS IN KENTUCKY. GEOSPATIAL CHARACTERIZATION OF RECREATION AREAS ALONG WITH SURVEYS AND ASSESSMENTS OF MANAGEMENT P RACTICES CAN HELP PROVIDE THE NEEDED INFORMATION ON TRENDS, DEMANDS, AND IMPORTANCE OF FOREST RECREATION IN KENTUCKY. THE EMERALD ASH BORER (EAB; AGRILUS PLANIPENNIS) HAS DEVASTATED THE ASH (FRAXINUS SPP.) POPULATION THROUGHOUT KENTUCKY AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EAB RESULTS IN DEAD STANDING ASH SNAG TREES THAT MAY HINDER FOREST RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO THEIR POTENTIAL FOR FALLING. THE OVERALL IMPACT OF EAB ON FORESTS IS STILL UNKNOWN AS IS THE FUTURE OF THE ASH TREE. STUDIES NEED TO BE CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE OVERALL IMPACT OF EAB ON FOREST ECOSYSTEMS AND TO DETERMINE WHICH SPECIES ARE REGENERATING IN IMPACTED AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN NORTHCENTRAL KENTUCKY WHERE BUSH HONEYSUCKLE, MULTIFLORA ROSE, GARLIC MUSTARD, AUTUMN OLIVE, AND OTHER INVASIVE SPECIES THRIVE IN DISTURBED AREAS. GROWING GINSENG MAY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL-SCALE FOREST OWNERS AND FARMERS INCLUDING SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS/FOREST OWNERS IN KENTUCKY TO GENERATE INCOME WHILE IMPROVING AND MAINTAINING THE HEALTH OF THEIR FORESTS. FOREST-FARMING, AN AGROFORESTRY PRACTICE, HAS SHOWN PROMISE TO OPTIMIZE GINSENG PRODUCTION, HOWEVER, NO RESEARCH EXISTS TO ASSESS ITS POTENTIAL IN KENTUCKY. GINSENG IS GROWN FOR ITS HEALTH BENEFITS, AND MARKETS EXIST FOR THIS SPECIES; HOWEVER, FARMERS AND PRODUCERS IN KENTUCKY LACK KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GINSENG PRODUCTION UNDER VARIOUS GROWING CONDITIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL ASSESS GENSING PERFORMANCE AND PRODUCTION USING FOREST FARMING AND OTHER PRODUCTION METHODS. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OF GROWING GINSENG WILL BE DEVELOPED UTILIZING THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY AND EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WILL BE OFFERED. THE BMPS WILL BE DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT KENTUCKYFARMERS CAN USE THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR LAND ECONOMIC PRODUCTION USING GINSENG PRODUCTION PRACTICES WHILE EMPLOYING SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL EVALUATE PARTICIPATION, TRENDS, AND DEMANDS FOR FOREST RECREATION BASED ON GEOSPATIAL CHARACTERIZATION AND SURVEYS AND TRAIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN KENTUCKY. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO ASSESS THE IMPACT EAB HAS HAD ON KENTUCKY FORESTS. PROJECT INFORMATION METHODOLOGY OBJECTIVE 1: ASSESS FOREST RECREATION PREFERENCES INCLUDING GEOSPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO DETERMINE CURRENT DEMANDS AND TRENDS IN KENTUCKY. FOREST RECREATION SURVEYS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE FIELD AT POPULAR HIKING, BIKING, AND HORSE TRAILS, AS WELL AS AT CANOEING, KAYAKING, AND CAMPING SITES (TRAILHEADS FOR BACKCOUNTRY CAMPING) THROUGHOUT KENTUCKY. SURVEY FOCUS AREAS WILL CONSIST OF THE BERNHEIM ARBORETUM AND RESEARCH FOREST (BULLITT COUNTY), DANIEL BOONE NATIONAL FOREST (EASTERN KENTUCKY-APPALACHIAN REGION), BIG SOUTH FORK NATIONAL RIVER AND RECREATION AREA (EASTERN KENTUCKY), STATE PARKS AND FORESTS, AND CITY AND COUNTY PARKS IN LARGER CITIES SUCH AS LOUISVILLE, FRANKFORT, AND LEXINGTON. SURVEY QUESTIONS WILL BE RELATED TO CURRENT RECREATIONAL USE (HIKING, WATCHING BIRDS AND WILDLIFE, KAYAKING, CANOEING, HUNTING, ETC.), PREFERRED RECREATIONAL USE, FOREST MANAGEMENT IN RECREATION AREAS (PRESCRIBED BURNING, TIMBER HARVESTING, INVASIVE SPECIES REMOVAL, ETC.), AESTHETICS, SUSTAINABILITY, NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS, HOW OFTEN INDIVIDUALS USE RECREATIONAL AREAS, DISTANCE TRAVELED, DISTANCE WILLING TO TRAVEL, YOUTH PARTICIPATION, IMPROVEMENTS, AND FUTURE PLANNED USE. THE NUMBER OF SURVEY QUESTIONS WILL BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM AND QUESTIONS WILL BE SPECIFIC TO THE RECREATIONAL AREAS. RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES ON OR NEAR RECLAIMED MINE SITES WILL ALSO BE OF INTEREST. GIS CHARACTERIZATION WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR ALL RECREATION AREAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER CORRELATIONS EXIST BETWEEN USE AND RECREATION AREA CHARACTERISTICS (SLOPE, ASPECT, ACRES, VEGETATION, WATERFEATURES, ACCESS, DISTANCE FROM CITIES, ETC.). THERE WILL ALSO BE QUESTIONS RELATED TO EMERALD ASH BORER (EAB) ON THE SURVEY AND THE GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF EAB ON THOSE AREAS. THIS WILL RELATE TO OBJECTIVE 3 BELOW. WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREAS (WMAS) WILL ALSO BE TARGETED TO ASSESS FOREST USE PREFERENCES AND TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH RECREATIONAL HUNTING. HUNTING SURVEYS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT WMA DEER AND OTHER WILDLIFE QUOTA CHECK STATIONS AS WELL AS AT LOCAL DEER PROCESSING FACILITIES TO ACCOUNT FOR HUNTERS WHO PRIMARILY HUNT ON PRIVATE LANDS. LEASE HUNTING IS BECOMING MORE POPULAR IN KENTUCKY AND WILL BE ASSESSED IN THESE SURVEYS. ALL SURVEYS WILL BE APPROVED BY KENTUCKY STATE UNIVERSITY PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION. SURVEYS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON TABLETS (IPADS) AT THE DESIGNATED LOCATIONS USING A SOFTWARE PROGRAM SUCH AS SURVEYMONKEY OR SIMILAR PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS OFFLINE ACCESS ON TABLETS. THE MAJORITY OF THE SURVEYS WILL BE CONDUCTED BY STUDENTS. SURVEY DATA WILL BE DOWNLOADED INTO A DATABASE, SUCH AS MICROSOFT ACCESS AND EXCEL, AND WILL BE ANALYZED USING SAS, SPSS, OR R. OBJECTIVE 2: EVALUATE AND COMPARE FOREST RECREATIONAL TRAIL (HIKING, BIKING, AND HORSE TRAILS) DESIGN, IMPACT, AND MANAGEMENT ON EROSION AND SEDIMENT DELIVERY. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREST RECREATION SURVEYS, WE WILL ASSESS TRAIL DESIGN, IMPACT, AND MANAGEMENT ON WATER QUALITY AT STREAM CROSSINGS. EROSION, SEDIMENT DELIVERY, AND WATER QUALITY WILL BE THE MAIN VARIABLES ASSESSED. WILDLIFE AND PLANT SPECIES MAY ALSO BE OF INTEREST. TRAILS WILL BE DIVIDED INTO THREE CATEGORIES: HIKING, BIKING, AND HORSE TRAILS. ADDITIONALLY, EACH TRAIL WILL BE SUBDIVIDED BY WIDTH, TRAFFIC, MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, AND LOCATION. STREAM CROSSING APPROACHES WILL BE OF INTEREST AND EROSION AND SEDIMENT DELIVERY WILL BE ESTIMATED (TONS/ACRE/YEAR) USING THE UNIVERSAL SOIL LOSS EQUATION, REVISED UNIVERSAL SOIL LOSS EQUATION, AND WATER EROSION PREDICTION PROJECT (WEPP). EROSION AND SEDIMENT DELIVERY WILL BE MEASURED USING SEDIMENT TRAP AND PINS AND A TOTAL STATION TO MEASURE SEDIMENT LOSS IF VANDALISM WILL NOT BE A CONCERN. VANDALISM OF EROSION COLLECTION AND SAMPLING AREAS WILL BE A CONCERN ON PUBLIC TRAILS SO PRELIMINARY MEASUREMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE METHODS TO REDUCE VANDALISM SUCH AS POSTING SIGNS ABOUT THE STUDY. SITE LOCATIONS WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE AREAS SELECTED IN OBJECTIVE 1. GIS CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SITE LOCATIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED AND A CORRELATION WILL BE COMPLETED BETWEEN EROSION RATES AND SITE CHARACTERISTICS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN SAS, R, OR SAS-JMP. OBJECTIVE 3: ASSESS FOREST HEALTH -RELATED CANOPY GAPS, SPECIFICALLY EAB-RELATED CANOPY GAPS IN KENTUCKY, USING DRONE- BASED REMOTE SENSING AND FIELD MEASUREMENTS. STUDY AREAS WILL INCLUDE THE BERNHEIM ARBORETUM AND RESEARCH FOREST, KENTUCKY STATE UNIVERSITY'S ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH CENTER (EERC) LOCATED IN HENRY COUNTY, AND POSSIBLY THE DANIEL BOONE NATIONAL FOREST (ALTHOUGH THIS LOCATION HAS LIMITED ACCESS WITH APPROPRIATE LAUNCH SITES FOR DRONES). DRONES WILL BE USED TO COLLECT HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGERY TO IDENTIFY TREES, CANOPY GAPS, AND STANDS AFFECTED BY EAB. NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI) AND NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE RED EDGE (NDRE) SENSORS WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE CANOPY GAPS. CORRELATIONS WILL BE MADE TO DETERMINE ACCURACY OF NDVI FOR IDENTIFYING AREAS AFFECTED BY EAB. A RED-GREEN-BLUE (RBG) CAMERA WILL BE USED FOR AERIAL IMAGERY. AFTER COLLECTION OF AERIAL IMAGERY, EAB-IMPACTED AREAS WILL BE DOCUMENTED BY CANOPY GAP SIZE (ACRES); SURROUNDING STAND COMPOSITION: SINGLE ASH TREE, MIXED, OR ASH-DOMINATED (ASH DENSITY); AND GPS COORDINATES. THE GPS COORDINATES WILL BE USED TO LOCATE EAB-IMPACTED AREAS TO CONDUCT FIELD ASSESSMENTS. FIELD ASSESSMENTS WILL CONSIST OF THE COLLECTION OF PLOT-LEVEL DATA. FIELD DATA WILL INCLUDE: SPECIES GROWING IN EAB CANOPY GAPS (INCLUDING REGENERATION), SIZE OF SPECIES FO UND (HEIGHT, DIAMETER, CROWN WIDTH), PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF INVASIVE SPECIES, LEAF AREA INDEX (LAI), ETC. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WILL COMPARE CANOPY GAP SIZE, SURROUNDING STAND COMPOSITION,SPECIES REGENERATING, INVASIVE SPECIES, AND LAI USING STATISTICAL SOFTWARE SUCH AS SAS, R, OR SAS-JMP. NDVI, NDRE, AND RBG IMAGERY WILL ALSO BE COMPARED WITH THE FIELD ASSESSMENTS TO DETERMINE HOW VALUES FROM THE DRONE SENSORS COMPARE TO VEGETATION GROWING IN THESE IMPACTED AREAS. THE USE OF DRONES FOR DETECTING CANOPY GAPS RELATED TO FOREST HEALTH CONCERNS WILL BE ADDRESSED. THE KENTUCKY DIVISION OF FORESTRY CURRENTLY MONITORS THE SPREAD AND STATEWIDE MORTALITY OF EAB AND THIS INFORMATION WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THIS STUDY. OBJECTIVE 4: EVALUATE THE GROWTH, PRODUCTION, AND PERFORMANCE OF AMERICAN GINSENG (PANAX QUINQUEFOLIUS) GROWN UNDER FOREST FARMING AGROFORESTRY PRACTICE. A FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT WILL BE SET-UP AT THE EERC TO ADDRESS OBJECTIVE #4 USING THREE PRODUCTION METHODS OF GINSENG (I.E., WILD-SIMULATED, WOODS CULTIVATED, AND FIELD CULTIVATED), PLANTING DENSITY (I.E., LOW AND HIGH DENSITY), AND ASPECT (NORTH-FACING, AND SOUTH-FACING SLOPES). THE WILD-SIMULATED METHOD WILL INVOLVE SIMULATING THE GROWTH OF GINSENG GROWING IN THE WILD BY PLANTING THE SEEDS MANUALLY AFTER RAKING THE SOIL. UNDER THIS METHOD, THE SOIL WILL BE MINIMALLY DISTURBED. THE WOOD CULTIVATED METHOD WILL INVOLVE GROWING GINSENG IN FORESTED ENVIRONMENT IN TILLED BEDS UNDER NATURAL SHADE, AND THE FIELD-CULTIVATED METHOD WILL INVOLVE GROWING OF GINSENG IN RAISED BEDS IN FIELD UNDER ARTIFICIAL SHADE USING POLYPROPYLENE SHADE CLOTHES. PRIOR TO PLANTING, LIGHT AVAILABILITY IN THE WILD-SIMULATED AND WOOD-CULTIVATED PLOTS WILL BE MEASURED. THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT MEASURED WILL BE APPLIED TO GINSENG GROWING IN FIELD-CULTIVATED METHOD TO CREATE UNIFORMITY OF LIGHT TRANSMISSION AMONG TREATMENTS. POLYPROPYLENE SHADE CLOTH WILL BE USED IN FIELD-CULTIVATED METHOD. A TOTAL 40 RANDOM PLOTS WILL BE SET-UP FOR THE STUDY. EACH PLOT WILL MEASURE 5 FT X 25 FT. A LOW (25 LBS/ACRE) AND HIGH (50LBS/ACRE) PLANTING DENSITY WILL BE EMPLOYED IN THE STUDY AND PLOTS WILL BE SET-UP IN NORTH-FACING SLOPE (16 PLOTS), AND SOUTH-FACING SLOPE (16 PLOTS). SOIL ANALYSIS WILL BE ASSESSED PRIOR TO PLANTING, AND BASELINE DATA ON TREE GROWTH WILL BE ESTABLISHED. PARAMETERS TO MEASURE WILL INCLUDE SURVIVAL RATE, PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS, ROOT PRODUCTION AND QUALITY. 13", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "36cc7b39-cea8-bc30-74b2-e89d88d9ca88-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23MSCFRXXXG072_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736161, "Award ID": "NI23MSCFRXXXG071", "Award Amount": 544775.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.202", "Description": "THE MCINTIRE-STENNIS COOPERATIVE FORESTRY RESEARCH GRANT FUNDS WILL BE USED BY FORESTRY PROGRAM FACULTY AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AT STEPHEN F.

WOODY BIOMASS FEEDSTOCKS HAVE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER AGRICULTURAL SOURCES, ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. WHERE FORESTS MAKE UP 67.4% OF THE TOTAL LAND AREA (SMITH 2009) AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION HAS BEEN IN A 20-YEAR DECLINE. WOODY BIOMASS IS AVAILABLE YEAR-ROUND FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, AND END USERS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE SOURCE OF MATERIAL; THIS ENSURES A CONSISTENT FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY, REDUCES THE RISK OF DRAMATIC PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, AND ELIMINATES THE NEEDS FOR COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE LONG-TERM STORAGE OF MATERIAL. AS PERENNIAL CROPPING SYSTEMS, BOTH FORESTS AND SHORT ROTATION WOODY CROPS (SRWCS), LIKE HYBRID WILLOW, PRODUCE A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS BEYOND A RENEWABLE SOURCE OF BIOMASS AND ARE LESS PRONE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN YIELD DUE TO ABNORMAL WEATHER PATTERNS OR PEST AND DISEASE OUTBREAKS THAN ANNUAL CROPS. THE NORTHEASTERN REGION HAS A WEALTH OF EXISTING BIOMASS FEEDSTOCKS AND THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE SUPPLIES IN THE FUTURE. PERENNIAL GRASSES, SHORT ROTATION WOODY CROPS, AND RESIDUES THROUGH TIMBER INDUSTRY, ARE THE MAIN SOURCES EASILY ACCESSIBLE IN THIS REGION. THERE ARE CURRENTLY BETWEEN 5 AND 6 MILLION DRY TONS OF WOODY BIOMASS AVAILABLE PER YEAR FROM THE FORESTS IN THE NORTHEAST AT A PRICE BETWEEN $60 AND $90 PER DELIVERED DRY TON ROADSIDE (USDOE 2016). IT IS ALSO ESTIMATED THAT THE REGION WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAINABLY PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL 1.2 MILLION DRY TONS OF BIOMASS PER YEAR, IN THE FORMS OF SRWC AND ENERGY GRASSES, BY THE YEAR 2030 AT $60 PER DRY TON AT THE FARMGATE (USDOE 2016). REGIONAL GROWTH OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SUPPLIES CAN STIMULATE THE CONVERSION OF IDLE LANDS FOR PRODUCTION OF ENERGY FEEDSTOCKS. THE REGION HAS 6.2 MILLION ACRES OF DISTURBED SURFACE MINED LANDS (SKOUSEN AND ZIPPER 2014). AT CURRENT YIELDS, THIS WOULD PRODUCE APPROXIMATELY 31 MILLION DRY TONS OF BIOMASS PER YEAR, GIVEN FULL SITE UTILIZATION. HOWEVER, BIOMASS HARVESTING, TRANSPORTATION, AND PROCESSING ARE LABOR INTENSIVE, AND THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND RELATIVELY LOW BULK DENSITY LIMIT THE ECONOMICAL TRANSPORTATION DISTANCE OF THESE MATERIALS TO MARKETS. THE PRODUCTIVITY AND HEALTH OF FOREST ECOSYSTEMS IN THE 21ST CENTURY WILL BE THREATENED BY THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE EFFECTS OF ELEVATED TEMPERATURES AND INCREASES IN WATER STRESS. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER DIFFERENT TREE POPULATIONS WILL BE ABLE TO COPE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, AND THERE IS GROWING CONCERN THAT THE UNPRECEDENTED RATE OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL VERY LIKELY EXCEED THE ECOLOGICAL, ADAPTIVE CAPACITY OF MANY TREE SPECIES. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THESE ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES IN A PROACTIVE MANNER BY IDENTIFYING EFFECTIVE FOREST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROMOTE RESILIENCY TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. IN CONTRAST, RELYINGON A REACTIVE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, SUCH AS SALVAGING TREES AFTER A MAJOR CLIMATE-MEDIATED DISTURBANCE, IS AN UNSUSTAINABLE APPROACH TO ADAPTING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THE KEY FOREST REGIONS THAT WILL BE EXAMINED INCLUDE PINE, OAK, AND SPRUCE FORESTS IN WEST VIRGINIA; THE SIERRA NEVADA REGION OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES; POPLAR AND PINE FORESTS IN CANADA; AND TROPICAL TREE SPECIES IN AFRICA AND ASIA. THE CLEAN WATER ACT REGULATES POLLUTION DISCHARGE INTO WATERS OF THE US AND REQUIRES STATES TO ADOPT WATER QUALITY STANDARDS FOR WATERS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH OR WELFARE AND ENHANCE QUALITY OF WATER FOR ITS CITIZENS. ADDITIONALLY, STATES ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOADS (TMDLS) FOR IMPAIRED WATERS. IF A STATE FAILS TO REGULATE POLLUTION DISCHARGE, THE US EPA IS AUTHORIZED TO DIRECTLY REGULATE THE STATE'S WATERS. MOST STATES HAVE WATER QUALITY PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR STREAMS AND LAKES, BUT RELATIVELY FEW STATES HAVE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS FOR WETLANDS. IN ORDER TO SET WETLAND WATER QUALITY STANDARDS WE NEED QUALITY DATA ON WATER QUALITY AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES SUCH AS INVERTEBRATES, TURTLES, AND SMALL MAMMALS.

RESEARCH EXAMINING MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES SUCH AS WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE RISK ASSESSMENTS, FUEL LOAD DYNAMICS, FOREST RESILIENCE, AND RECOVERY FOLLOWING WILDFIRES IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS KEY CONCERNS IN FIRE MANAGEMENT. WSU RESEARCHERS ARE INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF WILDFIRES ACROSS THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND THE IMPORTANCE OF FIRE REFUGIA (I.E., LOCATIONS WITH IMPORTANT BIOTA THAT REMAIN UNBURNED DURING A FIRE) FOR FOREST RECOVERY AND WILDLIFE HABITAT. THEY USE CUTTING-EDGE MULTISCALE REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGY IN COMBINATION WITH FIELD DATA, AERIAL LIDAR, AND SPACE-BORNE SENSORS TO QUANTIFY EFFECTS OF WILDFIRES AS WELL AS INSECTS AND DROUGHT. IN COLLABORATION WITH FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, THEY DEVELOPED DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS AND GEOSPATIAL DATA LAYERS TO MANAGE NATURAL RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY. THEY ALSO WORK WITH WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS AND ECOPHYSIOLOGISTS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES ON ANIMAL POPULATIONS AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING. AN UNBURNED ISLAND DATABASE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND A RANKING SYSTEM TO ASSESS THE WILDLIFE HABITAT VALUE OF UNBURNED AREAS WITHIN WILDFIRE PERIMETERS WAS DEVELOPED. THIS FLEXIBLE SYSTEM IS BEING APPLIED TO FIRES ACROSS THE WESTERN US AND ANY FIRE-SENSITIVE FOCAL WILDLIFE SPECIES. THESE TOOLS ARE BEING USED TO IDENTIFY HIGHER QUALITY HABITATS IN UNBURNED AREAS (I.E., FIRE REFUGIA) FOR VARIOUS SPECIES SUCH AS NORTHERN SPOTTED OWLS AND SAGE GROUSE AND TO IDENTIFY PERSISTENT UNBURNED ISLANDS THAT ARE ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT AREAS, TYPICALLY RELATED TO SPECIFIC TOPOGRAPHY AND FUEL TYPE CHARACTERISTICS. THIS GEOSPATIAL METHOD ALLOWS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF FIRE RISK, AND DEVELOPMENT OF A STRATEGIC PLAN TO OPTIMIZE FUEL REDUCTION EFFORTS AND ASSESS THE RESILIENCE OF FOREST ECOSYSTEMS TO HIGH SEVERITY WILDFIRES. FIRE SUPPRESSION OVER THE LAST HALF CENTURY HAS INCREASED CANOPY COVER, AND FUEL LOADING OF DRY FORESTS IN THE INLAND WESTERN US. THESE CHANGES NOT ONLY LEAD TO HIGH-SEVERITY, STAND-REPLACING WILDFIRES THAT ALTER NATURAL FOREST COMMUNITIES, BUT ALSO REDUCE LIGHT TRANSMISSION TO THE FOREST FLOOR. LESS SUNLIGHT LIMITS PRODUCTION OF HERBACEOUS AND WOODY UNDERSTORY VEGETATION THAT SERVES AS FORAGE FOR NATIVE WILD UNGULATES, SUCH AS MULE AND WHITE-TAILED DEER. MANY FEDERAL AND STATE-OWNED TIMBERLANDS ARE MANDATED TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE USES FOR THEIR PUBLIC STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING WILDLIFE.

THE ACT SEEKS TO PROMOTE FORESTRY EDUCATION, SO MOST MCINTIRESTENNIS FUNDING GOES TOWARD STUDENT SUPPORT. THE MCINTIRESTENNIS PROGRAM CURRENTLY FUNDS 2 RESEARCH PROJECTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOREST SCIENCES: 1. PRODUCTION OF BIODEGRADABLE PLASTIC COMPOSITES USING FOREST SOURCED MATERIALS (ACCESSION #7003635, PD RICK GUSTAFSON) NANO CELLULOSE IS A REMARKABLE MATERIAL THAT CAN HAVE MULTIPLE USES; A MAJOR ONE BEING TO IMPROVE THE BIODEGRADABILITY OF POLYMER PRODUCTS. CURRENTLY IT HAS LIMITED USE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST. TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN SEFS LOWERS THE COST BY TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. AT $10/KG THERE WILL BE MANY USES OF NANO CELLULOSE AND A LARGE DEMAND FOR RAW MATERIALS TO PRODUCE NANO CELLULOSE, SUCH AS FOREST RESIDUALS. IN THE PRODUCTION OF NANO CELLULOSE WE STRIP THE BIOMASS DOWN TO THE CELLULOSE FIBRILS; THEREFORE, RESIDUAL MATERIALS AREGOOD STARTING MATERIALS BECAUSE THEY ARE CHEAP AND ALREADY PARTIALLY DEGRADED. RESIDUALS CANNOT BE USED FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS PULP BECAUSE THE FIBERS ARE TOO DEGRADED. LOWCOST NANO CELLULOSE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TOTALLY REINVIGORATE THE DOMESTIC FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. THIS PROJECT WILL TRAIN A GRADUATE STUDENT WHO CAN HELP DEVELOP THIS NEW FOREST PRODUCTS MARKET. THE WORK WITH SQUAXIN ISLAND TRIBE WILL FORGE A NEW RELATIONSHIP THAT WE CAN BUILD ON WITH FUTURE RESEARCH INITIATIVES AND THE WHOLE PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF MCINTIRESTENNIS FUNDING TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS. 2. MODELBASED COUPLING OF WINTER HARDINESS AND SPRING PHENOLOGY IN PACIFIC NORTHWEST CONIFERS (ACCESSION #7003636, PD SOOHYUNG KIM) AS DOUGLASFIR IS A CULTURALLY, ECONOMICALLY, AND ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES, THIS WORK WILL IMPACT BROAD AUDIENCE INCLUDING STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS WA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (DNR) AND US FOREST SERVICE (USFS). THIS PROPOSED WORK CAN LEVERAGE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN EACH OF THESE AGENCIES TO ACCESS PLANT MATERIALS FOR ASSESSMENT, DISSEMINATE RESULTS, AND PROVIDE IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT. THE KEY OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE A PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT WILL IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF COLD HARDINESS AND SPRING PHENOLOGY OF CONIFERS, IDENTIFY THE DRIVING FACTORS OF THESE TRAITS, IMPROVE THE APPLICATION OF PHENOLOGY TO SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS, AND DETERMINE SENSITIVITY OF POPULATIONS TO ADVERSE EFFECTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS MODEL WILL QUANTIFY THE RISK OF NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ON FOREST HEALTH, FOREST PRODUCTIVITY, AND POTENTIAL FAILURE OF FOREST REFORESTATION AND RESTORATION. THE DRIVING FACTORS OF POPULATION ADAPTATION AND INDIVIDUAL ACCLIMATION OF COLD HARDINESS AND BUD BURST WILL BE DETERMINED BY USING PHYSIOLOGYDRIVEN MODEL AUGMENTED BY MACHINE LEARNING (ML) METHODS.

THEY WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND COLLABORATIVELY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS IN ALL 95 COUNTIES AND TO SERVE THE STATES 6.9 MILLION PEOPLE. THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE IS BASED IN KNOXVILLE AND SERVES AS THE STATES 1862 INSTITUTION. IT INCLUDES THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT EXTENSION) AND THE TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (UT AGRESEARCH). BASED IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY (TSU) IS THE STATES 1890 INSTITUTION; IT INCLUDES THE TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. THIS PLAN OF WORK REPRESENTS THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF UT EXTENSION, UT AGRESEARCH, TSU COOPERATIVE EXTENSION PROGRAM, AND THE TSU INSTITUTE FOR FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH. AGRICULTURE IS INTEGRAL TO TENNESSEES ECONOMY AND CULTURE. ALMOST ONE OF EVERY EIGHT TO NINE DOLLARS GENERATED IN THE STATEIS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE OR AN INDUSTRY THAT GENERATES PRODUCTS FROM A NATURAL RESOURCE  MORE THAN $79.3 BILLION ANNUALLY. THE STATES AGRICULTURAL AND RELATED EXPORTS TOTALED $2.2 BILLION IN 2021, UP $325 MILLION OR 17% WHEN COMPARED TO 2020. TENNESSEE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN ALL MAJOR COMMODITY CATEGORIES IN 2021. FARM RECEIPTS TOTALED $3.6 BILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 65.5% OF THIS VALUE COMING FROM CROPS AND 34.5% FROM ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC SUCCESSES OF TENNESSEE AGRICULTURE, 339,400 TENNESSEANS ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED BY AGRICULTURAL OR NATURAL RESOURCE INDUSTRIES, MAKING EFFECTIVE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS CRITICAL. TENNESSEES LANDGRANT INSTITUTIONS CONDUCT RESEARCH AND PROVIDE EXTENSION OUTREACH IN FIVE KEY AREAS TO ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THE STATE: SUPPORTING FOOD, FIBER, AND ENERGY SYSTEMS; ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; ENRICHING OUR ECONOMY; DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE; AND STRENGTHENING OUR HEALTH. RESEARCH PROJECTS PROVIDE NEW KNOWLEDGE TO HELP STAKEHOLDERS ADDRESS ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEM. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES SHARE THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ULTIMATELY TO RESULT IN A CHANGE IN ACTION OR CONDITION. EXTENSION WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING NEEDS CITIZENS AND AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS ACROSS THE STATE. HEALTH ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE TOP CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. EXTENSION WILL STRENGTHEN HEALTH PROGRAMMING BY OFFERING THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR IMPROVING DIETARY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR LIMITEDRESOURCE TENNESSEANS. EXTENSION LIVESTOCK AND FORAGE PROGRAMS STRENGTHEN OUR EXTENSION AND RESEARCH FOR THE STATES LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS, RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL WILL JOINTLY IMPLEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH IN HAY SCHOOLS, LATE GESTATION NUTRITION, MARKETING, FORAGE TESTING, AND STOCKPILED FORAGES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION HAS DEVELOPED PROGRAMS TO STRENGTHEN AND PROVIDE VALUEADDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRODUCERS. THE UT CENTER FOR FARM MANAGEMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS IN 2022. THE CENTER FACILITATES EXTENSION, TEACHING, AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS ON FARM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. THE CENTER WILL FOCUS ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF TENNESSEE PRODUCERS AND ENHANCING LONGTERM PROFITABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURE ENTERPRISES. THROUGH THE CROPS PRODUCTION SYSTEMS EXTENSIONS PROVIDE DEMONSTRATION AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT BENEFITS PRODUCERS. THE CROP VARIETY TRIALS FOR CORN GRAIN, SILAGE, AND SOYBEANS AS WELL AS PRODUCER EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR CORN, SOYBEANS, COTTON, WHEAT, AND TOBACCO PRODUCTION ARE KEY AREAS. THE CONSUMER ECONOMICS PROGRAM HELPS FAMILIES INCREASE SAVINGS, DECREASE DEBT, AND FINANCIALLY PLAN. THE ON MY OWN AND 4H WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED FOR YOUTH AND ADULTS THAT PROVIDE NEEDED SKILLS, TRAININGS, AND EXPERIENCES TO PARTICIPANTS. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OF TOP PRIORITY FOR EXTENSION. EXTENSION CONTINUES DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE AND PROVIDE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE NEXT CHAPTER PROGRAM IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND TENNESSEE 4H. IN CREATING THIS PROGRAM, WE WANT TO CREATE AN EARLY DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT SKILLS ARE NECESSARY FOR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BOTH THEIR SECONDARY AND POSTSECONDARY PLANS. 4H CONTINUES PROGRAMING ON HONING STEM AND CITIZENSHIP/LEADERSHIP SKILLS. UT AGRESEARCH CONDUCTS RESEARCH WITHIN ITS EIGHT ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND SEVEN PHYSICAL CENTERS, AND AT TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS (REC) LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE UNITS HELP DRIVE PLANNED RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND FACILITATE FACULTY RESEARCH PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO A DECADE OF EXCELLENCE: TENYEAR STRATEGIC PLAN FOR UTIA, 20182028, AGRESEARCH OPERATES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF ITS 20212024 AGRESEARCH STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN WITH THE OBJECTIVES TO BALANCE A PORTFOLIO OF INTEGRATED, INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAMS, CULTIVATE TEAMS TO APPROAL F). THE PROGRAM INCORPORATES BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT ULTIMATELY WILL CONTRIBUTE INFORMATION TO REFINE STRATEGIES THAT OFFER CARBON REDUCTIONS OVER TODAY'S AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS. AGRESEARCH IS REALIGNING THE CAPABILITIES AT TWO OF ITS TEN REC TO FACILITATE PLF INITIATIVE. THE LITTLE RIVER ANIMAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT PLANS TO HAVE MILKING ROBOTS IN OPERATION BY LATE FALL 2022, AND THE MIDDLE TENNESSEE REC IS RETOOLING TO SUPPORT PRECISION BEEF AND POULTRY PRODUCTION RESEARCH. ALSO, EXPANDED ACTIVITY IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE WILL RESPOND TO CONCERNS OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION. THE TRANSFORMATIONAL AGRICULTURAL GENOMICS AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY PROGRAM WILL ADVANCE ANIMAL AND PLANT-BASED PRODUCTIVITY. ALTHOUGH EARLY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT, THE INITIATIVE ALREADY ENGAGES FACULTY TO ADVANCE STATE-OF-THE-ART SCIENCE TO DESIGN CROPS THAT ARE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. FINALLY, THE BIOECONOMY ADVANCEMENT INITIATIVE IS AN ESTABLISHED INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABLE FUELS, CHEMICALS, AND MATERIALS. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IS EXPANDING RESEARCH CAPABILITIES IN SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AGGRESSIVE GRAND CHALLENGE GOALS ANNOUNCED BY THE WHITE HOUSE.  MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW PROCESSES TENNESSEE EXTENSION PROGRAMS FUNDED BY SMITH-LEVER OR NARETPA SECTION 1444 AND 1445 REQUIRE A MERIT REVIEW PROCESS. A PANEL OF EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS, PROGRAM LEADERS AND SCHOLARS FROM FOUR STATES REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TENNESSEE EXTENSION MERIT REVIEW CRITERIA. CRITERIA INCLUDES ASSESSING NEEDS, DELIVERY METHODS, IMPLEMENTATION STEPS, EVALUATION, ENSURING DIVERSITY AND DEFINED OUTCOMES. UT AND TSU COORDINATE MERIT REVIEW PROCESSES. STATE EXTENSION SPECIALISTS PROPOSE PLANNED PROGRAMS. ALL PROPOSED PROGRAMS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY A REVIEW TEAM OF UT EXTENSION ADMINISTRATORS AND SPECIALISTS. UT AGRESEARCH WILL UTILIZE THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE IT HAS PROVEN TO BE BOTH EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. HATCH REGULAR AND HATCH/MULTI-STATE RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDERGO A REVIEW PROCESS FOR MERIT AND SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS, AND TO ENSURE ALIGNMENT WITH ESTABLISHED RESEARCH PRIORITIES. THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR HATCH REGULAR RESEARCH PROJECTS BEGINS INFORMALLY WITH DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PROJECT DIRECTOR, COLLEAGUES, THE DEPARTMENT HEAD, AND, IF APPLICABLE, AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS (IF FIELD WORK IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT). A REVIEW PANEL OF THREE SCIENTISTS THEN EVALUATES THE PROPOSAL FOR CLARITY, TECHNICAL RELEVANCE, AND SCIENTIFIC MERIT. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR MAKES ANY NECESSARY REVISIONS AND SUBMITS THE PROPOSAL TO THE DEPARTMENT HEAD FOR REVIEW. IF APPROVED, THE DEAN/DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH THEN CONDUCTS A FINAL EVALUATION AND ENDORSES THE PROPOSAL FOR SUBMISSION TO NIFA. HATCH/MULTI-STATE PROJECTS GO THROUGH A COMPARATIVELY MORE EXTENSIVE REVIEW AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL, SO THE INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS IS ABBREVIATED. THE FACULTY MEMBER OFFICIALLY JOINS A MULTI-STATE PROJECT AFTER CONSULTING WITH COLLEAGUES AND, IF APPLICABLE, THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER ADMINISTRATORS. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR THEN SUBMITS A PROPOSAL REFLECTING THE UT COMPONENT DIRECTLY TO THE ASSOCIATE DEAN/ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF AGRESEARCH FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT. ONCE THE REVIEW IS COMPLETE AND ANY NECESSARY CHANGES ARE MADE, THE RESEARCHER SUBMITS THE PROJECT TO NIFA. STAKEHOLDER INPUT UT EXTENSION PURSUED MULTIPLE DATA COLLECTIONS FOR THIS PLAN OF WORK. ALL 95 COUNTIES HAVE LOCAL EXTENSION ADVISORY GROUPS THAT PROVIDE ONGOING STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE UT-TSU EXTENSION STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL REVIEWS AND UPDATES PLANS BI-ANNUALLY. EXTENSIVE STRATEGIC PLAN ACTIVITIES ALSO INFORMED THIS PLAN. EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND STATE AGENCY LEADERS PARTICIPATED IN SURVEYS, LISTENING SESSIONS AND FOCUS GROUPS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL ISSUES AFFECTING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HOW EXTENSION COULD ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. BASED ON THIS INPUT, THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL IDENTIFIED PLAN PRIORITIES. NEW STATE ACTION AGENDAS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS PRIORITIES. PLANS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE PROGRESS AND MAKE CHANGES. UT AGRESEARCH CONTINUES TO SEEK STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THROUGH SEVERAL MEANS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR TO DISCUSS AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES ISSUES, UTIA PROGRAM PRIOR ITIES, AND HOW UTIA, INCLUDING UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION, MAY RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES. SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE TENNESSEE FARM BUREAU, AND SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE  TENNESSEE STATE GOVERNMENT ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF COMMON RESEARCH INTERESTS. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS SERVE THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE TEN AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS AT THE INVITATION OF THE DEPARTMENT HEAD AND CENTER DIRECTOR, RESPECTIVELY, TO PROVIDE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND TO GUIDE FUTURERESEARCH PRIORITIES. FACULTY HELP DRIVE THE UT AGRESEARCH AGENDA BY REMAINING ABREAST OF EMERGING RESEARCH AND ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, PROGRAM LEADERS WITH STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING AGENCIES, THE PUBLIC, AND AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. ADDITIONALLY, THE UT SYSTEM IS COMPLETING A SURVEY THAT WENT STATEWIDE REGARDING PUBLIC INPUT INTO THE GRAND CHALLENGES FACING TENNESSEE. THIS WAS A UT SYSTEM EFFORT, BUT UT EXTENSION AND UT AGRESEARCH ASSISTED IN SHARING THE SURVEY ACROSS TENNESSEE AND THE RESULTS WILL CERTAINLY ADD TO THE INFORMATION WE USE TO DETERMINE DIRECTIONS FOR OUR WORK. UT AND TSU EXTENSION WILL EMPLOY THEIR EXTENSIVE, STATEWIDE NETWORK OF ADVISORY GROUPS FOR STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THE STATE EXTENSION ADVISORY COUNCIL PROVIDES INPUT AND DIRECTION FOR STATEWIDE INITIATIVES. TENNESSEE EXTENSION AGENTS WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON INVOLVING YOUTH AND OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES. ALL OF TENNESSEE'S 95 COUNTIES HAVE A COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE OF SEVEN LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, NOMINATED BY THE COUNTY MAYOR AND APPROVED BY MAJORITY VOTE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSION. EVERY COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEETS FOUR TIMES ANNUALLY, AND THEIR DUTIES INCLUDE INPUT INTO HIRING DECISIONS, LOCAL FUNDING, AND LOCAL PROGRAMMING. UT AGRESEARCH IMPLEMENTS SEVERAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS FOR INPUT. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES FROM COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, THE STATE GOVERNMENT, AND THE COMMUNITY. IT HOLDS PUBLIC MEETINGS TWICE PER YEAR TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO UT LEADERSHIP ON RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION ISSUES. THREE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS ARE COMPRISED OF THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE AND DEANS, REPRESENTATIVES FROM TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY GROUPS, AND CLIENTELE SERVED BY UTIA PROGRAMS. UTIA PERSONNEL NOMINATE THE COMMODITY GROUP AND CLIENTELE MEMBERS. EACH OF THE THREE REGIONAL ADVISORY GROUPS ELECTS ACHAIR TO GUIDE MEETINGS. IN ADDITION, UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMODITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. AS NEW PRIORITIES ARISE, THESE GROUPS SEEK OUT ONE ANOTHER TO DISCUSS COMMON RESEARCH NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP. ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS FOR THE UT AGRESEARCH ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS' AND GROUPS' RELEVANT BACKGROUND, EXPERTISE, AND COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. UT AGRESEARCH FACULTY REGULARLY INTERACT WITH THEIR PEERS AT PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND THROUGH JOINT PROJECT VENTURES. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS ENCOURAGE FACULTY TO MEET WITH PROGRAM LEADERS AT STATE AND NATIONAL FUNDING AGENCIES TO DISCUSS RESEARCH PRIORITIES. ADDITIONALLY, FACULTY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET WITH THE PUBLIC DURING AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER FIELD DAY EVENTS. TENNESSEE EXTENSION (UT/TSU) AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS ARE TRAINED IN NEEDS ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES AND HOW TO SELECT INDIVIDUALS FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES. COMMUNITY LEADERS SELECTED FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSITIES (I.E., GENDER, AGE, RACIAL/ETHNIC, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, EDUCATIONAL, ETC.) OF THE COUNTY OR AREA SERVED. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE AGENTS RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PAST AND CURRENT EXTENSION PROGRAMS; AND THEY RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT USED EXTENSION TO SERVE ON LOCAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND PARTICIPATE IN OPEN LISTENING SESSIONS. EXTENSION AGENTS ALSO CONDUCT SURVEYS ON PLANNED PROGRAM AREAS. UT AGRESEARCH COLLECTS INPUT THROUGH REGULAR CONTACT WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THE UT COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE AND THE UTIA REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCILS MEET TWICE PER YEAR. THE UT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE RESPONDS TO ANY ISSUES RAISED, AND, AS APPROPRIATE, MAY DELEGATE ACTION TO THE DEANS/DIRECTORS OF UT AGRESEARCH AND UT EXTENSION. UT AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORSMEET WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THEY HAVE FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS WITH THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT HEADS AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS WITH THE AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER DIRECTORS MONTHLY; COLLECTIVELY THEY MEET ONCE PER YEAR. THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND AGRESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTERS MEET WITH THEIR ADVOCACY/ADVISORY GROUPS ANNUALLY AND SHARE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WITH AGRESEARCH ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY AS APPROPRIATE. FACULTY ATTEND PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS AND READ SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND POPULAR PRESS ARTICLES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. DEPARTMENTS HOLD MONTHLY FACULTY MEETINGS WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS WITH PEERS AND THEIR DEPARTMENT HEAD. STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES AT LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND STATEWIDE LEVEL MONITOR AND ADJUST DEPLOYMENT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, THE OPINIONS FROM MANY TENNESSEANS, INCLUDING DECISION-MAKERS, CLIENTELE, PARTNERS, AND VOLUNTEERS WERE CONSIDERED. MORE THAN 120 STAKEHOLDERS AND 490 UT EXTENSION EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATED INTHE REGIONAL AND CAMPUS LISTENING SESSIONS. THE PLANNING EFFORT ALSO INCLUDED AN ONLINE SURVEY COMPONENT. UT EXTENSION WILL ADDRESS THE INCREASING URBANIZATION AND A LOSS OF FARMLAND IN THE STATE ARE CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. OUR NURSERY, FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTION PROGRAMS WILL PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON PLANT, PEST, AND SOIL DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. THE CENTER FOR PROFITABLE AGRICULTURE WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON THE STATE'S AGRITOURISM INDUSTRY AND VALUE-ADDED PROGRAMS. HEALTH ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE TOP CONCERNS FOR RESIDENTS. EXTENSION STRENGTHENED HEALTH PROGRAMMING BY OFFERING THE CDC DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM. TO STRENGTHEN OUR EXTENSION AND RESEARCH FOR THE STATE'S BEEF CATTLE PRODUCERS, RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION PERSONNEL WILL JOINTLY IMPLEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH IN HAY SCHOOLS, LATE GESTATION NUTRITION, MARKETING, FORAGE TESTING, AND STOCKPILED FORAGES.

LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED FORESTRY RESEARCH TOPICS: 2) MANAGEMENT OF FOREST AND RELATED WATERSHED LANDS TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS OF WATER FLOW AND TO PROTECT RESOURCES AGAINST FLOODS AND EROSION 6) UTILIZATION OF WOOD AND OTHER FOREST PRODUCTS EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES MAY PRESENT A DOUBLE?EDGED SWORD TO THE WATER RESOURCES. ON ONE HAND, EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS NANOTECHNOLOGY, BIOTECHNOLOGY, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HOLD GREAT PROMISE FOR END?OF?PIPE TREATMENT, IN?SITU REMEDIATION, POLLUTION CONTROL, AND POLLUTANT DETECTION. ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS NANOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY MAY PRESENT HEALTH AND CONTAMINATION RISKS TO THE WATER RESOURCES AND ECOSYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY INTRODUCE NEW MATERIALS TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE STATE OF FLORIDA IS FACING MANY WATER ISSUES THAT CAN BE SOLVED WITH THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN HOW TO PROPERLY APPLY THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO WATER BODIES WITHOUT DAMAGING THE AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THESE KNOWLEDGE GAPS HAVE IMPEDED THE APPLICATIONS OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SOLUTIONS TO FLORIDA AND GLOBAL WATER PROBLEMS. THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED AS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS FILLING THE KNOWLEDGE GAPS BY INFORMING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE?BASED STRATEGIES TO BEST UTILIZE THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO SOLVE WATER PROBLEMS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE FINDINGS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP NEW METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO SOLVE FLORIDA AND GLOBAL WATER PROBLEMS. THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE?BASED STRATEGIES TO BEST UTILIZE THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO SOLVE WATER PROBLEMS. THE OVERARCHING GOAL/OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE BENEFITS AS WELL AS RISKS OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO THE WATER RESOURCES. TO ACCOMPLISH THE OVERALL GOAL/OBJECTIVE, WE PLAN TO PURSUE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES TO: 1. APPLY EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES (E.G., NANOTECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY) TO ADVANCE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF WATER QUALITY MODELING AND MONITORING. 2. DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE LOW?COST MATERIALS FOR WATER TREATMENT/REMEDIATION USING EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES (E.G., NANOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOCHAR TECHNOLOGY), PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO BIOCHAR/AGRICHAR/CHARCOALBASED ADSORBENTS. 3.

GUIDELINES AND PROTOCOLS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COASTAL NATIVE SPECIES FOR USE IN RESTORATION AND IN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT, WHICH ARE BASED ON PEER?REVIEWED RESEARCH, FOR LAND MANAGERS AND CONSUMERS REMAINS LIMITED. THE RESULTS FROM THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO IMPROVE THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF NATIVE SPECIES AVAILABLE FOR COASTAL RESTORATION AND IMPROVE THE SURVIVAL OF PLANTS USED IN RESTORATION PROJECTS ON THE GULF COAST. ADDITIONALLY, PROPOSED OUTPLANTING RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE A RESTORATION CONTEXT AND INTEGRATE DUNE RESTORATION STRATEGIES IN AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION. GUIDELINES AND PROTOCOLS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COASTAL NATIVE SPECIES FOR USE IN RESTORATION AND IN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT, WHICH ARE BASED ON PEER?REVIEWED RESEARCH, FOR LAND MANAGERS AND CONSUMERS REMAINS LIMITED. THE RESULTS FROM THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO IMPROVE THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF NATIVE SPECIES AVAILABLE FOR COASTAL RESTORATION AND IMPROVE THE SURVIVAL OF PLANTS USED IN RESTORATION PROJECTS ON THE GULF COAST. ADDITIONALLY, PROPOSED OUTPLANTING RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE A RESTORATION CONTEXT AND INTEGRATE DUNE RESTORATION STRATEGIES IN AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE PHENOLOGY OF NATIVE COASTAL HERBACEOUS AND WOODY PLANT SPECIES, DEVELOP PROPAGATION, PRODUCTION AND TRANSPLANTING TECHNIQUES FOR THOSE SPECIES THAT HAVE POTENTIAL USE IN HABITAT RESTORATION AND TEST EFFECTS OF PRODUCTION SYSTEMS WITHIN A RESTORATION CONTEXT. THIS CAN BE FURTHER DEFINED AS (1) CHARACTERIZE THE PHENOLOGY OF COASTAL PLANT SPECIES, DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS OF APPROPRIATE TIMING FOR SEED AND CUTTING COLLECTION, AND DETERMINE IN WHAT COMMUNITY POSITIONS (FOREDUNE, SWALE, BACKDUNE, ETC.) THEY NATURALLY OCCUR WITHIN THE COASTAL ISLAND PLANT COMMUNITY; (2) TEST VIABILITY AND STORAGE CAPACITY OF SELECTED COASTAL NATIVE SPECIES SEEDS AND DETERMINE WHICH PREGERMINATIVE TREATMENTS ARE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN INITIATING GERMINATION; (3) IDENTIFY VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION METHODS FOR NATIVE SPECIES AND QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF ROOTING HORMONES (IBA, NAA) STOCK TYPE (WILD COLLECTED OR NURSERY CONTAINER GROWN), CUTTING TYPES (DORMANT OR ACTIVELY GROWING, SOFTWOOD OR HARDWOOD, ROOT CUTTINGS OR STEM CUTTINGS), ETC. ON PROPAGATION SUCCESS; (4) QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF CONTAINER PRODUCTION PRACTICES (CONTAINER SIZE, DIMENSION, DEPTH) ON THE TRANSPLANT SUCCESS AND SUBSEQUENT GROWTH OF NATIVE PLANT SPECIES WITHIN AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT RESTORATION CONTEXT; (5) QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF POST?PRODUCTION APPLICATION OF MINERAL NUTRITION, IRRIGATION, ROOT?DIPS OR HYDROGELS ON THE SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF NATIVE PLANT SPECIES; AND (6) QUANTIFY EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS ON THE GERMINATION OR TRANSPLANT ESTABLISHMENT OF COASTAL NATIVE PLANT SPECIES AND CORRELATE SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OBSERVATIONS WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES THAT INDICATE ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS. TARGET AUDIENCES INCLUDE FLORIDA RESIDENTS WITH OVER 60% OF FLORIDA'S POPULATION LIVING WITHIN 5 MILES OF THE COAST. MUCH OF THE NATURAL AREAS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THE IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT ARE PUBLIC LANDS REPRESENTING THE COASTAL DUNE COMMUNITY WHICH IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST THREATENED NATURAL COMMUNITIES IN FLORIDA. INFORMATION FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE PUBLIC VIA ADDITIONAL EXTENSION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THEDUNE RESTORATION MANUAL (MILLER ET AL 2018), PROPAGATION AND PRODUCTION PROTOCOLS, AND RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS. UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS EMPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO PRESENT RESEARCH RESULTS AS PART OF FORMAL CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION, INTERNSHIPS, WORKSHOPS AND PUBLICATION OF ADDITIONAL EXTENSION AND OUTREACH MATERIAL. RESEARCH RESULTS ARE CONTINUALLY INTEGRATED IN THE TEACHING PROGRAM AND WILL BE INTRODUCED INTO CLASSES SUCH AS PLANT PROPAGATION AND SAMPLING TECHNIQUES. METHODS AND TECHNIQUES WILL BE PUBLISHED IN MULTIPLE MEDIA SUCH AS RESEARCH JOURNALS, RESEARCH SYMPOSIA PRESENTATIONS AND POSTERS, AND EXTENSION PUBLICATIONS. IN THE SHORTER TERM, THIS RESEARCH WILL IMPACT THE POTENTIAL TO DESIGN AND ESTABLISH COASTAL DUNE RESTORATION PROJECTS WITH A BROADER RANGE OF NATIVE PLANT SPECIES WHICH CONTRIBUTE NOT ONLY TO DUNE STABILIZATION BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO DUNE BUILDING, HABITAT RESTORATION, AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION. DEVELOPING GUIDELINES FOR PROPAGATION, PRODUCTION AND WHEN, HOW, AND WHERE COASTAL NATIVE SPECIES CAN BE PLANTED INTO THE REDEVELOPING DUNE SYSTEM WILL INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF RESTORATION PROJECTS AND POTENTIALLY IDENTIFY NATIVE PLANTS USEFUL FOR COASTAL AND URBAN LANDSCAPES. DOCUMENTING PHENOLOGICAL DATA FOR COASTAL DUNE SPECIES WILL ASSIST IN ESTABLISHING TIMELINES FOR SEED OR CUTTING COLLECTION ESSENTIAL TO PRODUCTION OF THESE COASTAL DUNE SPECIES. THESE DATA WILL ASSIST PARK MANAGERS IN SCHEDULING OF MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS PRESCRIBED FIRE OR MOWING WHICH MAY IMPACT SEED PRODUCTION, DISPERSAL, OR SUCCESSFUL RECRUITMENT OF SEEDLINGS. THIS DATA WILL ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR DESIGNING MEANINGFUL EXPERIMENTS WHICH MAY LEAD TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES THE TEST SPECIES MAY OR WILL NOT WITHSTAND. 1 ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF AGRICULTURE, NATURAL RESOURCES, AND FOOD INDUSTRIES IN FLORIDA COUNTIES, 2019.

FRANKE COLLEGE OF FORESTRY AND CONSERVATION, UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA, MISSOULA, MT 59812 THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA'S PROGRAM OF RESEARCH IN FY2023 CONSISTS OF SIX CONTINUING PROJECTS AND ONE NEW TRANSDISCIPLINARY PROJECT - THAT ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ACROSS THE RANGE OF TOPICAL AREAS TARGETED BY THE MCINTIRE-STENNIS COOPERATIVE FORESTRY PROGRAM. FORESTS IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES SERVE MULTIPLE ROLES ON THE LANDSCAPE. FORESTS STORE CARBON, PRODUCE TIMBER, SUPPORT BIODIVERSITY, PROVIDE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, AND SERVE AS RANGE FOR LIVESTOCK. BALANCING ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES SUPPORTING EACH AND, PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE INTERACTIONS AMONG THE VARIOUS USES. OUR RESEARCH PROJECTS AIM TO UNDERSTAND THE INTERCONNECTED PROCESSES PROVIDING FOR MULTIPLE ROLES OF FORESTS ON THE LANDSCAPE. WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS POTENTIALLY IMPACT EACH FOREST USE. SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL INVESTIGATE 1) CAPACITY TO STORE CARBON AND OUR ABILITY TO MEASURE AND PREDICT STORAGE, 2) SEED BANK COMPOSITION AND POTENTIAL FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE RESTORATION OF FOREST AND RANGE IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN STRUCTURE, 3) WILDLIFE RESPONSES TO TIMBER, RANGE, AND RECREATIONAL USE, AND 4) SOCIAL RESPONSES TO FORESTS INCLUDING RECREATION AND VALUES. OUR RESEARCH ALIGNS WITH THE MANDATED RESEARCH AREAS OF THE MCINTIRE-STENNIS ACT AND IT ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE USDA STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS 1 AND 2. WE WILL LEVERAGE THE UM LUBRECHT EXPERIMENTAL FOREST IN ADDITION TO OTHER SITES AROUND THE WESTERN UNITED STATES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF FOREST SYSTEMS. WE WILL CONTINUE THE FIRE AND FIRE SURROGATE STUDY AS A LONG-TERM LONGITUDINAL STUDY TO UNDERSTAND FIRE AND THINNING PRACTICES. WE WILL EXAMINE CARBON STORAGE MEASUREMENT AND PREDICTION TOOLS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO PLAN FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT AS A CARBON STORAGE SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, WE WILL EXAMINE SEED BANK RESILIENCY AND WATER RESOURCES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW FORESTS CAN BE RESTORED AFTER STRUCTURAL CHANGES SUCH AS WILDFIRE AND TIMBER HARVEST. FOREST RESOURCES EXTEND BEYOND VEGETATION TO WILDLIFE AND PEOPLE WHO USE THEM. WE WILL FURTHER CONSIDER HOW MANAGEMENT FOR CARBON STORAGE CAN BE LINKED TO MANAGEMENT FOR WILDLIFE HABITAT AND RECREATION.

A FIFTH REGIONAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CENTER IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE REMAINS COMMITTED TO THIS STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH A PRESENCE IN ALL 75 ARKANSAS COUNTIES, ENSURING THAT RESEARCHERS AND EXTENSION EDUCATORS ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE SCIENCE AND BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE AND THE BROADER NEEDS OF FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. CONSISTENT WITH THE LAND GRANT MISSION, DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION FACULTY HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING LEADERSHIP IN THE DEVELOPMENT, DISSEMINATION AND DELIVERY OF INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. DIVISION RESEARCHERS CONDUCT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH FOR ARKANSAS PRODUCERS, BUSINESSES, COMMUNITIES, AND FAMILIES. COUNTY AGENTS AND SPECIALISTS STRIVE TO PROVIDE THE BEST SCIENCE?BASED RECOMMENDATIONS AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH STAKEHOLDERS ARE EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE SOURCES AND COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION AND DATA, THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE REMAINS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF IMPARTIAL AND SCIENCE?BASED RECOMMENDATIONS, INDEPENDENT OF FINANCIAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL INTERESTS. ALTHOUGH MOST IN?PERSON EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES HAVE RESUMED, THE DIVISION WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER TIMELY AND RESPONSIVE DISTANCE ED UCATION WEBINARS AND RESOURCES IN 2023 TO ENSURE WIDE?SPREAD ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BY ARKANSANS. THIS INCLUDES MONTHLY WEBINARS THROUGH THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL LAW CENTER ON CURRENT AND EMERGING IMPORTANT AGRICULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOOD LAW TOPICS. ONLINE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE 24/7/365 THROUGH THE DIVISION'S WEBSITE (HTTP://COURSES.UADA.EDU). DIVISION FACULTY ALSO ADDRESS TIMELY TOPICS OF INTEREST TO ARKANSANS THROUGH VIRTUAL EVENTS AND OTHER WEB?BASED PROGRAMMING. THE FOCUS OF WORK CONDUCTED BY THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE CONTINUES TO BE GUIDED ANNUALLY BY GRASSROOTS, COMMUNITY?BASED INPUT FROM A DIVERSE RANGE OF ARKANSAS CITIZENS; MAINLY THROUGH THE USE OF COUNTY EXTENSION COUNCILS AND OTHER LOCAL AND PROGRAM ADVISORY GROUPS. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE FORMALLY ENGAGED A LARGE POOL OF STAKEHOLDERS (INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL CLIENTELE, PRODUCERS, SCHOOLS, PARTNER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY LEADERS, UNDERSERVED GROUPS, AND LEGISLATORS) IN THE DESIGN AND DE VELOPMENT OF THE 2017?2023 STRATEGIC PLAN. BASED ON BROAD STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK, THE DIVISION IDENTIFIED FIVE AREAS TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS: AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING, ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD, STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES, BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES, AND NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT. THESE FIVE EMPHASIS AREAS HELP TO PROVIDE STRATEGIC LOCAL GUIDANCE FOR DIVISION RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AND HELP TO SUPPORT INTEGRATED RESEARCH/EXTENSION EFFORTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE NIFA SCIENCE EMPHASIS AREAS. AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING A CRITICAL NEED IN ARKANSAS, AND NATIONWIDE, IS TO ENSURE FARM AND FOREST ENTERPRISES ARE PROFITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE TO MEET THE DEMANDS FOR SAFE FOOD, FIBER, AND FUEL. THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY MUST CONTEND WITH MORE REGULATIONS, HIGHER INPUT COSTS, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, CLIMATE EXTREMES, AND GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IN A HUMANE AND SUSTAINABLE MANNER WHILE DECREASING COSTS THROUGH EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. PLANT SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE ECONOMICS, ENVIRONMENT, GENETICS AND BREEDING, WEEDS, DISEASE, PEST MANAGEMENT, SAFE HANDLING AND STORAGE, FOOD PROCESSING, CULTURAL PRACTICES, AND SOIL FERTILITY.  ANIMAL SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE GENETICS, REPRODUCTION, ECONOMICS, NUTRITION, WASTE MANAGEMENT, PHYSIOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS, HEALTH, AND ANIMAL WELLBEING. COMMON TO BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL SYSTEMS IS THE APPROPRIATE USE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY. ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOODS THE AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD IS VITAL TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN ALL COMMUNITIES. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE WORKS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETS THROUGH RESEARCH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS THAT TARGET OBESITY AND ENCOURAGE BETTER CONSUMER HABITS THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE EXPANDED FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM (EFNEP) AND SNAP?ED. EFNEP EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, WITH LIMITED INCOME, TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ATTITUDE, AND BEHAVIOR CHANGES NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN NUTRITIONALLY SOUND DIETS AND ENHANCE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. SNAP?ED PROVIDES NUTRITION EDUCATION TO FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE NUTRITION ASSISTANCE TO HELP CONSUMERS MAKE BETTER CHOICES ABOUT WHAT TO EAT TO STAY ACTIVE AND LIVE BETTER. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN FOOD SYSTEMS THROUGH RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. THE LONGTERM GROWTH OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY IN ARKANSAS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE INDUSTRY'S ABILITY TO INNOVATE, TO RESPOND TO CONSUMERS' TASTE AND EXPECTATIONS, TO EMPLOY A QUALITY WORKFORCE AND TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE MAINTAINING ECONOMIC VIABILITY. PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS AND AGENCIES ARE PURSUED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS FOODS. EXTENSION PROGRAMS HELP PEOPLE FROM MANY BACKGROUNDS UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE WISE NUTRITIONAL CHOICES AND STRETCH FOOD DOLLARS BY COOKING FOR THEMSELVES AND UTILIZE A WIDER VARIETY OF FOODS. THE DIVISION ALSO STRIVES TO ENHANCE FOOD SAFETY THROUGH RESEARCH AND TEACHING BEST PRACTICES TO ALL WHO HANDLE FOOD, FROM FIELD TO TABLE. THIS INCLUDES EDUCATION RELATED TO FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, SUCH AS HOW TO ADHERE TO THE FDA'S PRODUCE SAFETY RULE AND MEETING CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THROUGH SERVSAFE, A FOOD SAFETY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN FOOD HANDLING OR FOOD SERVICE AND RELATED INDUSTRIES. EXTENSION EDUCATORS PROVIDE EVIDENCE?BASED INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT ARKANSANS ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE BEST FOOD SAFETY INFORMATION TO KEEP THEIR FAMILIES SAFE FROM FOODBORNE ILLNESSES AND OTHER FOOD?RELATED SAFETY ISSUES. STRENGTHENING ARKANSAS FAMILIES IT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES THAT AFFECT FAMILIES, CONSUMERS, AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE. THE MENTAL, PHYSICAL, AND FINANCIAL WELL?BEING OF FAMILIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING PROSPERITY FOR ARKANSANS. THE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE IS RESPONDING TO THESE NEEDS BY DELIVERING RESEARCH?BASED PROGRAMS TO REDUCE STRESS, IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH, STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS, INCREASE FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND IMPROVE WELL?BEING FOR ARKANSANS. 4?H CLUBS, ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS ACROSS ARKANSAS INVOLVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN HANDS?ON EDUCATION AND SERVICE?LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT ENHANCED THEIR LIFE SKILLS, INCLUDING DECISION MAKING, PROBLEM SOLVING, CRITICAL THINKING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES. 4?H CONVEYS TO THE PUBLIC THAT ALL YOUTH HAVE VALUE. STRIVING TO REACH A DIVERSE POPULATION IS KEY TO DEVELOPING CURRICULUM, OFFERING RECOGNITION, AND TEACHING STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS TO REPRESENT OUR STATE'S CURRENT DEMOGRAPHICS. BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY, TECHNOLOGY AND POPULATION ARE TRANSFORMING HOW ARKANSANS LIVE AND WORK. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND EFFECTIVELY EMPLOY TOOLS AND RESOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LABOR FORCE REQUIRES ENHANCED SKILLS AND TRAINING TO SUCCEED IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY. AT A TIME WHEN MANY RURAL AREAS ARE LOSING POPULATION, COMMUNITIES MUST TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO CREATE A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE. EFFECTIVE AND INCLUSIVE LEADERS WORKING WITH ENGAGED CITIZENS ARE KEY TO THIS EFFORT. TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL NEEDS, PROGRAMS FOCUS ON FOUR AREAS: ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EVOLVING ECONOMIES; LEADERSHIP AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT; AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND PLACE. NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ARKANSAS FACES CRITICAL NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUES INCLUDING GROUNDWATER DECLINE IN EASTERN ARKANSAS FROM IRRIGATION, WATER QUALITY CONCERNS FROM ANIMAL MANURES, SEDIMENT LOSS FROM CROPLAND AND URBAN STORMWATER. WE ALL SHARE CONCERNS FOR SOIL HEALTH, AIR QUALITY, PROTECTION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OF FORESTS AND WILDLIFE HABITAT, BUT AGRICULTURE IS UNDER SCRUTINY TO REDUCE IMPACT ON NATURAL RESOURCES. WE FOCUS ON UNBIASED RESEARCH AND SCIENCE?BASED EXTENSION EFFORTS TO BALANCE CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. PROGRAMS, SUCH AS ARKANSAS DISCOVERY FARMS AND THE CENTER FOR AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SUSTAINABILITY, WILL COLLABORATE WITH FARMERS, LANDOWNERS, AND INDUSTRY TO DELIVER INNOVATIVE, SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE PROPER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO INFORM RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS, THE DIVISION WILL LAUNCH A FORMAL AND COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT IN 2023 TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIES FOR THE ORGANIZATION'S NEW STRATEGIC PLAN WITH INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "07ee21ac-739d-5576-dcac-ca74ea0e4047-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23MSCFRXXXG053_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154735896, "Award ID": "NI23MSCFRXXXG052", "Award Amount": 243924.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-23", "CFDA Number": "10.202", "Description": "THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS FEDERAL AWARD IS TO SUPPORT RESEARCH AND EXTENSION ACTIVITIES ALIGNED WITH THE BROAD GOALS OF THE USDA AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS IN ARIZONA.

THE STATE REPRESENTS A MAJOR REGION OF RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES. ITS 365 MILLION ACRES INCLUDE THE NATION'S LARGEST OIL RESERVES, COAL DEPOSITS AND THE TWO LARGEST NATIONAL FORESTS. THE STATE CONTAINS THE LARGEST TERRESTRIAL BIOME ON EARTH - THE BOREAL FOREST - THAT IT SHARES WITH OTHER NORTHERN LOCATIONS. ALASKA HAS A VARIED GEOGRAPHY THAT OFFERS SOILS FOR PRODUCTION OF FOOD, FIBER AND BIOMASS FUELS AS WELL AS FOR A MULTITUDE OF RECREATIONAL AND TOURISM ACTIVITIES. ALASKA'S NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY, THOUGH RESOURCE INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY EXTRACTIVE IN NATURE. ALASKA'S ECONOMY HAS BECOME DEPENDENT UPON REVENUES RELATED TO PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT. TO DIVERSIFY ITS ECONOMY, THE STATE IS EXPANDING AND EXAMINING POTENTIAL IN MOVING TOWARD NON-PETROLEUM NATURAL RESOURCES FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COST-EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE. THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES IS A PREDOMINANT FORCE IN THE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF ANY TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS (UAF) IN GENERAL AND AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY EXPERIMENT STATION (AFES), IN PARTICULAR, MEET THE CHALLENGES OF INCREASING DEMANDS FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT ARE RELEVANT TO SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF ALASKA'S RESOURCES AND BRING COMMUNITY IDEAS TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE'S RESOURCES. WHILE ALASKA IMPORTS A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FOODS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, GROWERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PRODUCE FRESH MARKET POTATOES, VEGETABLES AND HERBS; FORAGES, GRAINS AND MANUFACTURED LIVESTOCK FEEDS; CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDE BEDDING PLANTS, FLORALS, LANDSCAPE ORNAMENTALS AND SHORT SEASON VEGETABLES; AND A VARIETY OF NICHE MARKET CROPS. LIVESTOCK ENTERPRISES IN ALASKA ARE VARIED IN SIZE AND SPECIES OF ANIMAL IN PRODUCTION. PRODUCERS NEED INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO NORTHERN LATITUDES THAT WILL PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE AN ABUNDANT AND SAFE FOOD SUPPLY. AS THE POPULATION GROWS, MORE LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY PRODUCED FOOD WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE GREATER FOOD SECURITY. MANY ALASKANS LIVE A SUBSISTENCE LIFESTYLE OR SUPPLEMENT THEIR DIETS WITH FISH AND GAME MEAT. HIGH ENERGY COSTS REMAIN A CRITICAL ISSUE, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL ALASKA, WHERE FUEL OIL CAN COST DOUBLE AND GASOLINE CAN COST TRIPLE THE AVERAGE PRICE PER GALLON COMPARED TO URBAN AREAS. RESEARCH WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON NEW AND ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY, WOOD AND BIOMASS AND ENERGY CONSERVATION. AFES WILL WORK TO PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION TO MANAGE RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY FOR ENHANCING THE ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE AT HIGH LATITUDES. RESEARCH WILL ALSO FOCUS ON THE HEALTH OF OUR LARGEST FOREST BIOME, INCLUDING UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE, INSECT INFESTATION, AND LAND USE. ECOLOGICAL DROUGHT IS IMPACTING FOREST FIRE THREAT AND BARK BEETLE INFESTATION, WHICH IS DAMAGING FOREST NATURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR TOURISM, FIREWOOD AVAILABILITY, AND INCREASED FIRE RISK. WHILE FORESTERS, FARMERS AND LAND MANAGERS USE RESEARCH RESULTS, ALL ALASKANS BENEFIT FROM THE WISE USE OF LAND RESOURCES.  RESEARCH PROJECTS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM PRODUCERS, INDUSTRIES, AND STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR INFORMATION ON PLANT, ANIMAL AND SOIL SCIENCES, FOREST SCIENCES AND RESOURCES MANAGEMENT. AFES PRIORITIES, LIKE NATIONAL PRIORITIES, ARE TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABILITY OF FOOD, FOREST, AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS; ADAPT TO AND MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE; SUPPORT ENERGY SECURITY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES; ENSURE A SAFE, SECURE AND ABUNDANT FOOD SUPPLY; STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; AND SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY ANDCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND RESILIENCE. EXPERIMENT STATION RESEARCHERS WILL CONTINUE TO PUBLISH RESEARCH IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, BOOKS, AND IN EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETINS, CIRCULARS, NEWSLETTERS, RESEARCH PROGRESS REPORTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PUBLICATIONS. SCIENTISTS WILL ALSO DISSEMINATE THEIR FINDINGS THROUGH CONFERENCES, PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS, WORKSHOPS AND OTHER PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS LIKE WEBSITES AND BLOGS. NATURAL RESOURCES, ECOSYSTEMS <(>&<)> FORESTRY: RESEARCH WILL ADDRESS STAKEHOLDER NEEDS FOR UNBIASED, SCIENCE-BASED INFORMATION ABOUT NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN FORESTRY, MINING, WATER, RECREATION AND ALTERNATIVE, SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SOURCES. ALASKA'S FOREST AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCE POTENTIAL FOR BIOENERGY PRODUCTION IS IMMENSE BUT REQUIRES MORE RESEARCH. THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF ALASKA'S FORESTS IS UNDER-REALIZED IN TIMBER AND NON-TIMBER PRODUCTS. THE FOREST ECOSYSTEM AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS CAN PLAY A ROLE IN DIVERSIFYING THE ECONOMY OF ALASKA. CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH AND SURVIVAL OF RESOURCE BIODIVERSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CENTRAL ISSUE IN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN ALASKA AND ELSEWHERE. AS ENERGY CONTINUES TO BECOME A GROWING CONCERN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THE BOREAL FOREST HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS NECESSARY FOR FUEL ALTERNATIVES TO PETROLEUM AND COAL. THE FOREST ECOSYSTEM ALSO PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE CULTURE AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF ALASKAN CITIZENS. THE BOREAL FOREST IS EXPERIENCING ECOLOGICAL DROUGHT AND THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AT A HIGHER RATE THAN MANY OTHER ECOSYSTEMS. HOW THE FOREST RESPONDS TO CLIMATE CHANGE WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR WILDFIRE VULNERABILITY, INSECT INFESTATION, AND CLIMATE-INDUCED STRESS THAT IMPACTS TREE GROWTH, WOOD PRODUCTION, WATER USE, AND WILDLIFE HABITAT. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED THAT FOCUSES ON THESE CRITICAL FOREST ISSUES. ALL NEW AND REVISED MCINTIRE-STENNIS PROJECT PROPOSALS UNDERGO PEER REVIEW. THE BLIND PEER REVIEW PANEL IS COMPOSED OF A MINIMUM OF THREE MEMBERSAND CONSISTS OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES FROM THE DISCIPLINE OF THE PROPOSAL/PUBLICATION OR RELATED DISCIPLINES, GENERALLY AT OTHER LANDGRANT UNIVERSITIES. EACH REVIEWER COMPLETES A PEER REVIEW FORM THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC CRITERIA, PROVIDES FOR OTHER COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS, AND MAKES A RECOMMENDATION TO THE DIRECTOR. REVIEWS ARE RETURNED TO THE AUTHOR(S) FOR REVISION IF NEEDED. THE DIRECTOR REVIEWS ALL COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REVIEWERS ALONG WITH THE REVISED PROPOSAL/PUBLICATION BEFORE IT IS SENT TO USDA. FOR MCINTIRE-STENNIS PROJECTS, THE DIRECTOR CONFIRMS THAT PROPOSALS ARE SENT OUT TO THREE RELATED CONTENT EXPERTS. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS (PIS) ARE ASKED TO SUBMIT NAMES OF REVIEWERS WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THE APPLICABLE FIELD, PREFERABLY FROM ANOTHER LAND GRANT. THE DIRECTOR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT REVIEWERS THAT ARE NOT ON THE LIST. EITHER THE DIRECTOR OR A REVIEWER MAY REQUEST A REREVIEW AFTER MODIFICATION. THEN THE PI IS CLEARED TO WORK WITH THE SITE ADMINISTRATOR TOSUBMIT THE PROPOSAL TO NIFA FOR APPROVAL. AFES WILL MEET WITH AUDIENCES ON DEMAND THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL SETTINGS EACH YEAR. EXAMPLES OF THESE AUDIENCES INCLUDE FORESTRY AND NATURAL RESOURCE ASSOCIATIONS, ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGES, TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS AND REGIONAL CORPORATIONS, BOROUGH AND CITY GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPALITIES, GROWER GROUPS MEETING AT REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE CONFERENCES, INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN FUEL/ENERGY PRODUCTION, TRIBAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICTS (TSWCDS) AND SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICTS (SWCDS), AND STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (INCLUDING THE DIVISION OF FORESTRY), USDA, NRCS, AND THE NATIONAL FOREST SERVICE. AFES PLAN TO ENGAGE WITH ADVISORY COMMITTEES, FOCUS GROUPS AND PARTICIPANTS IN LISTENING SESSIONS AS WELL AS CONTINUE TO CONDUCT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND STAKEHOLDER SURVEYS AS METHODS TO IDENTIFY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS FROM WHOM TO COLLECT INPUT. FACULTY AND STAFF WILL UTILIZE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU DATA TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL AUDIENCES AND PARITY GOALS.

A REVIEW OF ANY EXISTING BMPS CAN BE DONE TO USE AS BASELINE DOCUMENTS AND THEN BUILD AND IMPROVE FROM THERE BASED ON THE CONDITION OF EXISTING SITES, NEEDS AND PRIORITIES. IDENTIFICATION OF PATHOGENS AND POTENTIAL VECTORS WILL BE MADE, AND CORRELATED RISK ANALYSES WILL BE DONE. FIELDWORK BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES INCLUDING WEED CONTROL, REVEGETATION, WATERING, SEED COLLECTION, AND INFRASTRUCTURE (TRAILS, ROADS, AND CONSTRUCTION) AND MAINTENANCE AS APPROPRIATE WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, DEVELOPED AND MODIFIED AS NECESSARY. PROCEDURES FOR EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS MOVEMENT WILL ALSO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, DEVELOPED, AND MODIFIED AS NECESSARY. SAMPLING AND MONITORING PROTOCOLS WILL BE OUTLINED. BASED ON EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION GLEANED, DEVELOP CORRESPONDING PROTOCOLS FOR IMPROVED SITE SELECTION AND PRACTICE. THESE WILL BE MODIFIED AND ADAPTED TO MANAGE FOR THE PATHOGENS FOUND, ASSOCIATED HOSTS, AND LANDSCAPE AND ECOSYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS. 2) OPTIMIZATION OF GENETICALLY IMPROVED SEEDLINGS FOR SOUTHERN FORESTS THROUGH THIS PROJECT, I PROPOSE TO USE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS TO BROADEN THE KNOWLEDGE BASE OF IMPORTANT SPECIES TO INCREASE YIELD OF DESIRED PRODUCTS. I WILL USE NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN GENOMICS AND TRADITIONAL FOREST TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP BETTER PROTOCOLS FOR LANDOWNERS TO INCREASE FOREST CROP PRODUCTION. THE FIRST AIM IS TO USE TRADITIONAL SELECTION: WE WILL USE INFORMATION FROM PROGENY TESTS WITH NEW YEAR MEASUREMENTS TO FURTHER INFORM SELECTION OF SUPERIOR GENOTYPES. A SECOND AVENUE AIMED AT EVALUATION OF SELECTION METHODS WILL GENERALLY BE DEPENDENT ON CONTINUED MONITORING OF TREE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT SO THAT AGE-AGE CORRELATIONS CAN BE STUDIED. TO AUGMENT TRADITIONAL SELECTION BASED ON VISUAL OR PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS OF VOLUME, HEIGHT, OR DIAMETER, WE COULD ALSO EXPLORE USE OF QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI (QTL) ANALYSIS AND OTHER MOLECULAR MARKER TECHNIQUES TO MAKE SELECTIONS AT YOUNGER AGES. PROPAGATION OF CLONAL SPECIES: DEVELOPMENT OF FIELD PROPAGATION TECHNIQUES WILL FIRST BEGIN WITH SELECTION OF SUPERIOR INDIVIDUALS. THESE WILL BE MEASURED FOR DIAMETER AND LENGTH AND TIME OF CUTTING HARVEST WILL BE RECORDED. WE WILL ALSO TRY VARIOUS TREATMENTS OF CUTTING PREPARATION INCLUDING TREATMENTS OF VARIOUS ROOTING POWDERS. FROM THIS DATA WE WILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE MODELS THAT WILL HELP INDICATE METHODS FOR MAXIMIZING EFFICIENCY OF PLANTING THESE CUTTINGS. 3) WOOD UTILIZATION IN A CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT RECOGNIZING INTRICATE, AND POTENTIALLY MESSY, INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT, SOCIETY, AND ECONOMY IN THIS POST-RECESSIONAL ERA REQUIRES NOVEL LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING. THIS IS CRITICAL TO TRANSFORMING CHALLENGES INTO OPPORTUNITIES. THIS WORK WILL EXPLORE THREE PRIMARY AVENUES BY WHICH PRODUCTION FORESTRY CURRENTLY CONTRIBUTES TO, AND CAN POTENTIALLY INCREASE ITS IMPACTS ON, REGIONAL ECONOMIES: 1) BY BRINGING NEW MONEY INTO THE REGION VIA EXPORTS, 2) BY DEVELOPING NEW OR SUBSTITUTING LOCALLY PRODUCED GOODS AND SERVICES FOR IMPORTED INPUTS, AND 3) BY ATTRACTING VALUE ADDED MANUFACTURING THAT CAN INCREASE REGIONAL PRODUCT. THE PRIMARY MEANS OF ASSESSING THESE CONTRIBUTIONS AND IMPACTS WILL SOCIAL ACCOUNTING MATRIXES OF VARIOUS REGIONAL ECONOMIES. THE STUDIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT CAN PROVIDE INTERESTED PARTIES- INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS (LANDOWNERS, LOGGERS, MILLS), ADVOCATES (ASSOCIATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS), AS WELL AS LAWMAKERS- NEEDED INFORMATION WHEN INVOLVED IN POLICY AND DECISION-MAKING DISCUSSIONS. THIS COULD BE PARTICULARLY TRUE IN AREAS WHERE FORESTRY'S ROLE(S) MAY NOT BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD. PROJECT INFORMATION METHODOLOGY THE PRIMARY MEANS OF ANALYSIS WILL BE VIA INPUT-OUTPUT TABLES AND SOCIAL ACCOUNTING MATRIXES. AN INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE QUANTIFIES TRANSACTIONS BY HOW MANY DOLLARS EACH SECTOR PROCESSES TOSELL AND PURCHASES FOR USE. THE TABLE SEPARATES PROCESSING SECTORS BY ROWS AND PURCHASING SECTORS BY COLUMNS; EVERY SECTOR IS CONSIDERED TO BE BOTH A PROCESSOR AND PURCHASER. SUMMING EACH ROW QUANTIFIES AN INDUSTRY'S OUTPUT, WHICH INCLUDES SALES TO OTHER PRODUCTION SECTORS ALONG WITH THOSE TO FINAL USERS. BEYOND THE INPUT-OUTPUT FRAMEWORK ARE THE NONMARKET INCOME FLOWS OCCURRING IN A REGION, SUCH AS HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVING WAGES AND BENEFITS FROM INDUSTRIES, DIVIDENDS FROM CORPORATIONS, AND/OR TRANSFER PAYMENTS FROM GOVERNMENT. A SOCIAL ACCOUNTING MATRIX DETAILS THESE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS VIA CONSTRUCTION OF SUBMATRICES IN ADDITION TO THAT CHARACTERIZING THE TRADITIONAL INTER-INDUSTRY FLOWS FOUND IN AN INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE. 4) PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF WILDLIFE RESPONSE TO CATTLE GRAZING IN A LONGLEAF PINE THE SOUTHWESTERN LOUISIANA/SOUTHEASTERN TEXAS REGION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY USDA NRCS AS A PRIORITY AREA FOR LONGLEAF PINE RESTORATION, AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVING RESTORATION EFFORTS IN THE REGION BY INTEGRATING GRAZING INTO LONGLEAF PINE MANAGEMENT. THE IMPACT OF GRAZING ON WILDLIFE IN LONGLEAF PINE, HOWEVER, IS NOT KNOWN. WITH THIS STUDY, I PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE LONGLEAF RESTORATIONS EFFECT ON CURRENT STATUS OF AVIAN AND MAMMAL POPULATIONS AT THE LOUISIANA ECOLOGICAL FORESTRY CENTER, LLC (LEAF CENTER) NEAR LEESVILLE, LOUISIANA. SPECIAL FOCUS WILL BE ON THE ENDANGERED RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER (RCW), AS WELL AS BAIRD'S POCKET GOPHER, PRIMARY PREY SPECIES OF THE THREATENED LOUISIANA PINE SNAKE. THIS STUDY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF LONGLEAF PINE ECOSYSTEM DISTURBANCE (CATTLE GRAZING), SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF LONGLEAF PINE HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE. INFORMATION GAINED FROM THIS STUDY WILL AID IN FUTURE HABITAT DECISION MAKING BY LONGLEAF PINE FOREST OWNERS AND MANAGERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE AREAS WHERE PRESCRIBED BURNING MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE. 5) HIGH-RESOLUTION DATA AND PRECISION FORESTRY APPLICATIONS IN SOUTHERN UNITED STATES FORESTS IN THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT, PROVIDING A DIVERSITY OF SPECIES, HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE, AREAS FOR RECREATION, AND TIMBER RESOURCES. THE INTENDED STUDIES TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT WILL 1) INCORPORATE READILY DEPLOYABLE TECHNOLOGY (E.G., AERIAL AND TERRESTRIAL LIDAR (LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING) EQUIPMENT) TO ASSESS BIOMETRIC DATA; 2) COMPARE THESE METHODS - AERIAL AND TERRESTRIAL LIDAR DATA WITH HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGERY AND FIELD-BASED MEASUREMENTS - TO UNDERSTAND POTENTIAL BIAS OF REMOTELY-SENSED MEASURES IN FOREST INVENTORY MEASUREMENTS; 3) ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODELS FOR SELECT TREE SPECIES TO PREDICT VOLUMES FROM UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV)-MEASURED VARIABLES; AND 4) AID IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS AND DIFFERENCES WITHIN STANDS BASED ON GROWTH AND/OR ASSESSED HEALTH DIFFERENCES. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO: 1. INCORPORATE READILY DEPLOYABLE TECHNOLOGY (E.G., AERIAL AND TERRESTRIAL LIDAR EQUIPMENT) TO ASSESS BIOMETRIC DATA; 2. COMPARE AERIAL AND TERRESTRIAL LIDAR DATA WITH HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGERY AND FIELD-BASED MEASUREMENTS TO UNDERSTAND POTENTIAL BIAS OF REMOTELY-SENSED MEASURES IN FOREST INVENTORY MEASUREMENTS; 3. DEVELOP MODELS FOR SELECT TREE SPECIES TO PREDICT VOLUMES FROM UAV-MEASURED VARIABLES; 4. UNDERSTAND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS AND DIFFERENCES WITHIN STANDS BASED ON GROWTH AND/OR ASSESSED HEALTH DIFFERENCES PROJECT INFORMATION METHODOLOGY DATA COLLECTION FOR THIS STUDY WILL INCLUDE REMOTELY-SENSED SOURCES (E.G., LIDAR AND VARIOUS RESOLUTION AERIAL AND SATELLITE DATA).

EVALUATING CONSERVATION STRUCTURES OACTIVITIES: FARMERS, FARM LANDOWNERS, AND AGRIBUSINESS ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO ENHANCE THE DELIVERY OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES FROM FARMS. THE ABILITY OF FARMS TO RETAIN NUTRIENTS AND SEDIMENT AND PROVIDE CLEAN WATER, FLOOD CONTROL, CARBON STORAGE, AND WILDLIFE HABITAT ARE OF INCREASING CONCERN TO SOCIETY, CORPORATIONS, AND POLICY MAKERS. FARMERS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL MANAGERS NEED EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND TOOLS FOR SITING THEM TO MEET THESE NEW DEMANDS ALONGSIDE THE TRADITIONAL DEMANDS OF FOOD, FEED, AND FUEL PRODUCTION. THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO ASSIST FARMERS, FARM LANDOWNERS, AND THEIR TECHNICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS BY IMPROVING THE KNOWLEDGE BASIS FOR ADOPTING AND SITING ON-FARM CONSERVATION STRUCTURES INCLUDING PRAIRIE STRIPS, BIOREACTORS, RIPARIAN BUFFERS, SATURATED BUFFERS, AND GRASS PATCHES. EARLY WORK ESTABLISHES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE CONSERVATION STRUCTURES FOR PROVIDING A RANGE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, BUT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED OVER ECOLOGICALLY SHORT-TIME PERIODS OR AT A LIMITED NUMBER OF SITES. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL EXPAND UPON THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE THROUGH ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS THE PRODUCTION OF MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CONSERVATION STRUCTURES OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF MEASUREMENT AND A BROADER GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT. ADDITIONAL DATA AND ANALYSIS WILL ALLOW US TO QUANTIFY VARIABILITY IN TIME AND SPACE, OFFERING AN UNDERSTANDING THE GENERALIZABILITY OF EXISTING AND NEW RESULTS. SUCH UNDERSTANDING IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR PROPER SITING AND MANAGEMENT OF CONSERVATION STRUCTURES ACROSS A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL. ODELIVERABLES AND OUTCOMES: WE REGULARLY INTERACT WITH VESTED STAKEHOLDER GROUPS TO DISSEMINATE RESULTS AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK ON USER INFORMATION NEEDS. OUTLETS HAVE INCLUDED DIRECT CONTACT WITH FARMERS AND FARMLAND OWNERS THROUGH RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED ON THEIR FARMS; PRESENTATIONS AT FIELD DAYS, CONFERENCES, ISU EXTENSION TRAININGS, AND WEBINARS; AND THROUGH AD HOC MEETINGS AND DIRECT CONSULTATION. DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD WE HAVE MADE 47 PRESENTATIONS TO A COMBINATION OF SCIENTIFIC, AGENCY, FARM MANAGEMENT, AND CONSERVATION GROUPS, REACHING APPROXIMATELY 1,410 PEOPLE.  BECAUSE MANY PRESENTATIONS WERE MADE THROUGH A VIRTUAL FORMAT THIS YEAR, BECAUSE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, MOST PRESENTATIONS WERE RECORDED AND CONTINUE TO BE BROADLY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. INFORMATION HAS ALSO BEEN DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEDIA OUTLETS, INCLUDING THE CEDAR RAPIDS GAZETTE, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO, OMAHA WORLD HERALD, SUCCESSFUL FARMING, AND WALLACE'S FARMER, AMONG OTHER OUTLETS. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: FARMERS AND FARM LAND OWNERS, AGRIBUSINESS, NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS, AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY STAKEHOLDERS ARE THE MAIN TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS WORK.THESE STAKEHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE PEOPLE WORKING FOR UNIVERSITIES, AGENCIES (E.G., IOWA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND LAND STEWARDSHIP, IOWA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, US FOREST SERVICE, USDA FARM SERVICE AGENCY, USDA NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION SERVICE), NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (E.G., IOWA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION, IOWA NATURAL HERITAGE FOUNDATION, IOWA SOYBEAN ASSOCIATION, IOWA WILDLIFE FEDERATION, PRACTICAL FARMERS OF IOWA, THE NATURE CONSERVANCY, TREES FOREVER), OR PRIVATE CONSULTANTS (E.G., CERTIFIED CROP ADVISORS, FARM MANAGERS, CONSULTING FORESTERS, TECHNICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS). SATELLITE-BASED FOREST STRUCTURE O ACTIVITIES: THE SUCCESS OF SPACE-BASED FOREST DEFOLIATION MONITORING BEYOND THEMATIC CLASSIFICATION HINGES ON OUR ABILITY TO LINK UNITS OF CONTINUOUS FOLIAR CHANGE WITH ASSOCIATED UNITS OF SPECTRAL CHANGE ACROSS DIFFERENT FOREST-INSECT SYSTEMS. RESEARCH DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD USED MULTI-TEMPORAL LANDSAT SENSOR DATA AND FIELDDEFOLIATION DATA ACROSS THREE DIFFERENT FOREST SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES (SPRUCE BUDWORM [SBW], JACK PINE BUDWORM [JPBW], AND SPONGY MOTH [SM]) TO COMPARE LEVELS OF DEFOLIATION WITH SATELLITE-BASED SPECTRAL RESPONSE. WE FOUND THAT FOR SIMILAR LEVELS OF DEFOLIATION ACROSS DIFFERENT FOREST SYSTEMS, SPECTRAL RESPONSE VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN BUDWORM AND SPONGY MOTH SYSTEMS AND, DEPENDING ON FIELD DATA USED, BETWEEN THE BUDWORM SYSTEMS (I.E., SBW <(>&<)> JPBW) AS WELL. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO REPORT THAT, FOR A GIVEN QUANTITY OF DEFOLIATION, SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN BOTH THE MAGNITUDE AND DIRECTION OF VEGETATION INDEX CHANGE EXISTS AMONG DIFFERENT DEFOLIATOR SYSTEMS, WHICH CURRENTLY PRECLUDES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VIABLE, UNIFIED DEFOLIATION MODEL. OTHER RESEARCH FINDINGS DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD SUGGEST THAT THERE MAY BE AN INSECT OUTBREAK FLIP MECHANISM OCCURRING BETWEEN SBW AND THE FOREST TENT CATERPILLAR (MALACOSOMA DISSTRIA, FTC) IN THE SAME REGION. OUR CONTINUED INSECT-HOST SIMULATION MODELING RESEARCH IN THE COMING YEARS AIMS TO CONFIRM THIS THEORY. O DELIVERABLES AND OUTCOMES: WE HAVE REACHED OUR TARGET AUDIENCES THROUGH PUBLICATIONS AND CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS. FOR THIS REPORTING PERIOD WE PUBLISHED FOUR PAPERS WITH ONE MORE PAPER IN REVIEW, HAVE AUTHORED OR CO-AUTHORED PRESENTATIONS WITH MORE PLANNED, AND RESULTS OF THIS WORK ARE ALSO AVAILABLE VIA USFS WEBSITES: HTTP://WWW.NRS.FS.FED.US/DISTURBANCE/FIRE/EXTREME_FIRE_EFFECTS_MN/ O INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THE TARGET AUDIENCES FOR THIS PROJECT ARE FORESTLAND MANAGERS, NATURAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS, PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL FORESTS, AND OTHER FOREST OR FORESTRY STAKEHOLDERS. THESE INCLUDE THE US FOREST SERVICE, CANADIAN FOREST SERVICE, US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, COUNTY LAND DEPARTMENTS, STATE DNR, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (E.G., THE NATURE CONSERVANCY, ECOFORESTRY INSTITUTE SOCIETY, AMERICAN FOREST FOUNDATION), OR PRIVATE CONSULTANTS WITH MANAGEMENT FOCUS. TERTIARY AUDIENCES INCLUDE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS RELATED TO URBAN ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCY OACTIVITIES: WE CONTINUED TO COLLECT DATA TO DETERMINE WATER QUALITY AND WATER QUANTITY OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN URBAN WATERSHEDS IN CEDAR FALLS AND DES MOINES, IOWA. DATA ARE BEING USED TO DEVELOP STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SIMULATION MODELS TO ASSESS AND PREDICT THE POTENTIAL FOR WATERSHED IMPACTS OF CLUSTERED PRACTICES ON OUTFLOWS FROM FOUR SUBWATERSHEDS. DATA FROM SURVEYS ADMINISTERED TO RESIDENTS IN THE SAME WATERSHED AREAS HAVE BEEN ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, OPINIONS AND BELIEFS ON VOLUNTARY HOMEOWNER ADOPTION OF A SET OF RESIDENTIAL LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. WE CONTINUED TO ASSESS EFFECTS OF VEGETATION ON BUILDING ENERGY DYNAMICS THROUGH PROVIDING SHADE AND COOLING ROM EVAPOTRANSPIRATION IN NEAR-BUILDING MICROENVIRONMENTS IN DES MOINES, IOWA. WE DEVELOPED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND ON BUILDING ENERGY USE. WE CONTINUED TO ASSEMBLE DATASETS TO FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT, ECOHYDROLOGICAL, AND ENERGY-USE MODELS FOR AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT OF TABLE FOOD PRODUCTION FOR THE DES MOINES METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA. MODELS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED USING HISTORICAL DATA AND WILL BE USED TO PREDICT FUTURE SYSTEM DYNAMICS UNDER SCENARIOS INCLUDING CHANGES IN CLIMATE, LAND USE AND FOOD PRODUCTION LEVELS AT VARIOUS SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. INITIAL WORK HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO USE SEVERAL PAIRS OF MODELS IN PRELIMINARY CO-SIMULATION APPLICATIONS. WORK WAS COMPLETED ON DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES FOR PLANT MATERIAL SOURCING FOR HABITAT RE STORATION AND CONSERVATION. ODELIVERABLES AND OUTCOMES: RESULTS FOR WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN DISSEMINATED IN MEETINGS WITH WATERSHED COO RDINATORS AND TO WATERSHED RESIDENTS IN TWO NEW BROCHURES ON STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND ONE VIRTUAL WORKSHOP FOR THESE AUDIENCES. RESULTS FOR WATERSHEDRESIDENT SURVEY RESULTS WERE ALSO SHARED IN ONE CONFERENCE PRESENTATION, AND RESULTS FOR WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENTS WERE SHARED IN ONE POPULAR-PRESS ARTICLE AND ONE SYMPOSIUM PRESENTATION. A VIRTUAL (VIDEOTAPED) FIELD TOUR FOCUSED ON URBAN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT WAS DELIVERED IN A HOSTED CONFERENCE TO A LIVE AUDIENCE OF75 PARTICIPANTS THAT INCLUDED WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT COORDINATORS AND ENGINEERS, AND WAS THEN MADE AVAILABLE ON AN IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY WEBSITE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. RESULTS FOR INTEGRATION OF BIOPHYSICAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEM DATA HAVE BEEN SHARED IN MEETINGS WITH PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS, LOCAL SUSTAINABILITY TASK FORCES, AND IN PRESENTATIONS AT LOCAL, REGIONAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES, AS WELL AS IN THEIR PROCEEDINGS. ADDITIONAL RESULTS HAVE BEEN SHARED IN TWO PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL JOURNALS. WORK ON BIODIVERSITY IN URBAN AREAS WAS INCLUDED IN TWO PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS AND AN ACCESSIBLE ONLINE WEB-BASED PRESENTATION. OINTENDED BENEFICIARIES:AUDIENCES FOR THIS WORK INCLUDE CITY RESIDENTS, LOCAL AND REGIONAL PLANNERS, WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT COORDINATORS, CIVIC OFFICIALS, CITY SUSTAINABILITY MANAGERS, CITIZEN SUSTAINABILITY TASK FORCE MEMBERS, PUBLIC WORKS PERSONNEL, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS, FOREST MANAGERS, FORESTRY CONSULTANTS, NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AGENCY PERSONNEL, AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY PERSONNEL. RESULTS FROM WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN SHARED AT WORKSHOPS, MEETINGS AND OUTREACH EVENTS WITH NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS AND RESIDENTS TO LEAD TO INCREASED KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS OF STORMWATER ISSUES AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. SILVICULTURAL APPROACHES FOR MAINTAINING AND ENHANCING FOREST ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND HABITAT IN THE UPPER MIDWEST REGION OACTIVITIES: RESEARCH DURING THIS PERIOD ADVANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE SHORT-TERM FOREST BIRD RESPONSE TO SUDDEN MORTALITY (FROM TREATMENT) OF INVASIVE HONEYSUCKLE IN THE MID-STORY OF UPLAND DRY MESIC OAK FORESTS. RESULTS CONFIRMED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AERIAL HERBICIDE APPLICATION AS A TREATMENT FOR INVASIVE HONEYSUCKLE AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR FOLLOW-UP TREATMENT WITHIN FIVE YEARS. RESULTS ALSO ILLUSTRATED THE IMPORTANCE OF HERBACEOUS UNDERSTORY COVER (POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY HONEYSUCKLE REMOVAL) FOR SHRUB AND GROUND-ASSOCIATED BIRDS. A GRADUATE STUDENT COMPLETED HER M.S. THESIS ON THIS PROJECT. WE ALSO PUBLISHED AN INTRODUCTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE SHOWCASING 20-30-YEAR RESULTS FROM AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF LONG-TERM STUDIES FOCUSED ON THE COMBINED IMPACTS OF BIOMASS REMOVAL AND SOIL DISTURBANCE ON FOREST ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY. VEGETATION DATA WERE COLLECTED ON A REPLICATED BEFORE AND AFTER STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF AERIAL TREATMENT OF INVASIVE HONEYSUCKLE ON UPLAND DRY-MESIC OAK FORESTS OF SOUTHERN IOWA. THIS WAS THE FIRST POST-TREATMENT GROWING SEASON AND RESULTS, ONCE ANALYZED, WILL QUANTIFY THE IMMEDIATE IMPACTS OF TREATMENT ON INVASIVE HONEYSUCKLE, OTHER WOODY SHRUBS, TREE REGENERATION, AND HERBACEOUS UNDERSTORY PLANTS. FOREST INVENTORY DATA WERE ALSO COLLECTED ACROSS STATE-OWNED LANDS IN THE DRIFTLESS AREA IN A RECONNAISSANCE EFFORT THAT LED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF 7-10 SITES FOR INCLUSION IN A LONG-TERM (20+ YEAR) FOREST CLIMATE ADAPTATION EXPERIMENT. LASTLY, A FIELD TOUR AND ASSOCIATED WORKSHOP WAS HELD FOR FOREST AND WILDLIFE MANAGERS AND SCIENTISTS IN THE TRI-STATE REGION (WISCONSIN, MINNESOTA, AND IOWA) TO BEGIN A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING CLIMATE ADAPTIVE SILVICULTURE FOR DRY MESIC OAK FORESTS OF THE DRIFTLESS AREA. ODELIVERABLES AND OUTCOMES: RESEARCH RESULTS WERE COMMUNICATED TO FOREST AND WILDLIFE MANAGERS, SCIENTISTS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF VENUES, MOSTLY VIRTUAL DUE TO CONTINUED IMPACTS FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS INCLUDED THE ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA ANNUAL MEETING, THE NORTHERN HARDWOODS CONFERENCE, THE IOWA CHAPTER OF THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING, THE IOWA SOCIETY OF AMERICAN FORESTERS FALL MEETING, AND THE SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA ANNUAL MEETING. OUR RESEARCH, PUBLICATIONS, PRESENTATIONS, AND WORKSHOPS INCREASED THE UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN MIDWESTERN FORESTS, INVASIVE SPECIES REMOVAL TREATMENTS AND IMPACTS, AND LONG-TERM FOREST ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE TO EXPERIMENTAL DISTURBANCE. OINTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THIS PROJECT DURING THIS PERIOD INCLUDED THE IOWA, MINNESOTA, AND WISCONSIN FORESTRY COMMUNITY (FORESTERS, WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS, OTHER LAND MANAGERS, PRIVATE LANDOWNERS) AND THE FOREST SCIENCE COMMUNITY. PARTNERS INCLUDE THE USFS NORTHERN RESEARCH STATION, THE NORTHERN INSTITUTE OF APPLIED CLIMATE SCIENCE, THE ADAPTIVE SILVICULTURE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE NETWORK, IOWA DNR, MINNESOTA DNR, WISCONSIN DNR, AND NGOS. REFERENCE CONDITIONS FOR RESTORATION OF MIDWESTERN STREAMS AND RIPARIAN CORRIDORS OACTIVITIES: THIS PROJECT EXPLORES THE RECENT ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY OF STREAMS AND THEIR RIPARIAN CORRIDORS IN IOWA AND SURROUNDING REGIONS. THIS HISTORY, COMBINED WITH EXISTING CONDITIONS, PROVIDES KEY INSIGHT THAT CAN GUIDE THE RESTORATION OF STREAM AND FLOODPLAIN ECOSYSTEMS. IN 2020 AND 2021, OUR TEAM VISITED OVER 40 STREAM REACHES AROUND THE STATE OF IOWA AND COLLECTED CHANNEL GEOMETRY AND HYDROLOGICAL DATA. SOME OF THESE SITES WERE DEGRADED, BUT SELECTED REACHES ALSO INCLUDED BIO NET REFERENCE OR CANDIDATE REFERENCE REACHES, BASED ON PAST DNR DATA INDICATING HEALTHY STREAM BIOTA. THESE DATA HAVE NOW BEEN THOROUGHLY ANALYZED TO REVEAL PATTERNS IN CHANNEL WIDTH, DEPTH, AND BANK FULL DISCHARGE AS THEY VARY WITH WATERSHED SIZE. THIS ANALYSIS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF \"REGIONAL CURVES\", WHICH PROVIDE BASELINE DATA FOR ENGINEERS AND ECOLOGISTS DESIGNING STREAM RESTORATION PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE. ONE KEY FINDING IN THIS ANALYSIS HAS BEEN THAT STREAMS IN URBAN WATERSHEDS (WHERE URBAN LAND COVER IS MORE THAN 10% OF WATERSHED AREA) ARE SYSTEMATICALLY LARGER IN WIDTH AND DEPTH THAN THOSE IN MORE RURAL WATERSHEDS. O DELIVERABLES AND OUTCOMES: WE JOINED COLLEAGUES IN A SPRING 2020 SUMMIT ON FORESTRY AND WATER QUALITY IN IOWA, IN WHICH WE DISCUSSED OUR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS REGARDING THE ROLE OF RIPARIAN FOREST IN WATER QUALITY WITH SEVERAL DOZEN ACADEMIC, AGENCY, AND NGO STAFF FROM AROUND THE STATE. WE ALSO SERVED ON A PANEL ADDRESSING JOHNSON COUNTY CONSERVATION DISTRICT CONTRACTORS TO ADDRESS THE VALUE OF RIPARIAN TREES IN STREAM CHANNEL STABILITY AND STREAM HEALTH. A GRADUATE STUDENT PRESENTED PRELIMINARY REGIONAL CURVES FROM OBJECTIVE 3 AT THE UPPER MIDWEST STREAM RESTORATION SYMPOSIUM IN FEBRUARY 2020. CONTINUING COMMUNICATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE IOWA DNR RIVER PROGRAMS IS KEEPING REGIONAL CURVES UP TO DATE AND SUPPLYING ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING DATA. O INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: PRELIMINARY REGIONAL CURVES HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED TO THE IOWA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, WHICH MAINTAINS THE \"IOWA RIVER RESTORATION TOOLBOX\", WHICH IS A DECISION SUPPORT TOOL FOR STREAM RESTORATION AROUND THE STATE. REGIONAL CURVES ARE PROGRAMMED INTO THE TOOLBOX AS A WAY FOR DNR STAFF AND RESTORATION PRACTITIONERS TO IDENTIFY EXISTING CONDITIONS OR PROPOSED RESTORED CONDITIONS IN THEIR PROJECT REACH(ES) THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE UNSTABLE. THE TOOLBOX IS WIDELY USED WITHIN THE STATE OF IOWA, AS WELL AS IN SOME ADJACENT STATES. PRIOR TO OUR PROJECT, STREAM DESIGNERS IN IOWA HAD TO SELECT FROM CURVES DEVELOPED IN MINNESOTA OR NORTH CAROLINA, BOTH OF WHICH LED TO SIGNIFICANT RISK OF RESTORATION FAILURE, EITHER DUE TO OVERSIZED CHANNELS THAT WOULD PROVIDE INADEQUATE MOISTURE TO RIPARIAN ECOSYSTEMS OR UNDERSIZED CHANNELS THAT FLOOD EXCESSIVELY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7148b6ec-c422-d557-aa04-0c8488cc6775-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23MSCFRXXXG037_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736034, "Award ID": "NI23MSCFRXXXG036", "Award Amount": 127469.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-18", "CFDA Number": "10.202", "Description": "ABSTRACT INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IS REVOLUTIONIZING INDUSTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, FROM HEALTHCARE TO MANUFACTURING.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS MCINTIRE-STENNIS PROJECT ACCESSION NO. 1024391 EXPLORING THE USE OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS TO CONTROL HEMLOCK WOOLLY ADELGID (HWA, ADELGES TSUGAE) ALONG WITH THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATIC FACTORS ON HWA. BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCED LADYBEETLE PREDATOR (SASAJISCYMNUS TSUGAE), ARE THE ONLY VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO MAINTAINING THIS INTEGRAL PART OF OUR FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. (2) INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: FOR EXAMPLE, MCINTIRE-STENNIS PROJECT ACCESSION NO. 7001298 IS INVESTIGATING ALTERNATIVE HOST-TARGETED STRATEGIES REDUCING TICK ABUNDANCES IN RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS IN THE URBAN-RURAL INTERFACE. AS LYME DISEASE (LD) CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST COMMONLY REPORTED VECTOR-BORNE ILLNESS IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS WORK WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF LYME DISEASE CASES (3) URBAN FORESTRY: FOR EXAMPLE, MCINTIRE-STENNIS PROJECT ACCESSION NO. 1023745 IS DEVELOPING TOOLS FOR DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESSED URBAN TREES AND IS DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE STRESS TOLERANCE IN URBAN TREES. CONNECTICUT'S URBAN AREAS HAVE THE HIGHEST TREE COVER IN THE UNITED STATES AND MAINTAINING A HEALTHY FOREST CANOPY COVER IN URBAN AREAS IS CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH, HABITABILITY OF URBAN AREAS, AND BIODIVERSITY. RESEARCH WILL BENEFIT NOT ONLY URBAN RESIDENTS, BUT MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS AND ARBORISTS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING TREE HEALTH. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS MCINTIRE-STENNIS PROJECT ACCESSION NO. 1018306 THAT HAS BEEN EXAMINING THE MANAGEMENT OF EMERALD ASH BORER (AGRILUS PLANIPENNIS) IN URBAN, HIGH VALUE ASH TREES. THE STUDY HAS BEEN TESTING EFFECTIVE, NON-TOXIC ALTERNATIVES TO SEVERAL HIGHLY EFFECTIVE INSECTICIDES THAT WILL PROTECT INDIVIDUAL TREES, YET ALL ARE TOXIC TO NATIVE INSECTS AND POTENTIALLY POLLINATORS IN ADDITION TO THE TARGET PEST.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2d911ac8-a89d-885c-a0f6-0f9b1c6988f8-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23MSCFRXXXG034_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736234, "Award ID": "NI23MSCFRXXXG033", "Award Amount": 604188.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-18", "CFDA Number": "10.202", "Description": "THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU) APPROVED PLAN OF WORK (POW) ENCOMPASSES A FIVE?YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING ON OCTOBER 1, 2022 AND REPRESENTS A JOINT EFFORT BY THE TWO CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF OSU'S COLLEGE OF FOOD, AGRICULTURAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES (CFAES): THE OHIO AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (ALSO KNOWN AS OARDC) AND OSU EXTENSION.

MOST OF OUR RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE USDA FOREST SERVICE, SOUTHERN RESEARCH STATION, NATIONAL FORESTS IN ALABAMA, AND (FIA) FOREST INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS. WE ARE QUANTIFYING THE OCCURRENCE, CHARACTERISTICS, AND MANAGEMENT OF PINE-HARDWOOD FORESTS IN THE NORTH ALABAMA REGION, ASSESSING THEIR ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE, AND ESTABLISHING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRODUCTIVITY AND DIVERSITY AND THE IMPACT OF RECREATION AND OTHER HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE TRENDS IN REGENERATION AND SPECIES COMPOSITION. OTHER OBJECTIVES INCLUDE INVESTIGATING THE BEHAVIOR, USE PATTERNS, AND PARTICIPATION LEVELS IN RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES BY VISITORS TO THE BANKHEAD NATIONAL FOREST AND IDENTIFYING THE FACTORS WHICH LIMIT THE USE OF THE WILDERNESS AREAS BY MINORITIES. ECOLOGICAL GEOMETRY IS SEARCHED IN FOREST STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS. THROUGH PERIODIC MONITORING OF ABUNDANCE, SPECIES OF TREE INDIVIDUALS, AND THEIR GROWTH RATES AT DIFFERENT FORESTS (INCLUDING MIXED BROADLEAVED FORESTS AND PINE PLANTATIONS) ACROSS SPATIAL SCALES BY GROUND MONITORING, REMOTE SENSING, AND GIS DATA, INDICES OF ECOLOGICAL GEOMETRY ARE DEVELOPED TO STUDY THE SPATIAL-TEMPORAL DYNAMICS IN FOREST STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS. THE IMPLICATIONS OF ECOLOGICAL GEOMETRY IN FOREST MANAGEMENT WILL BE EXPLORED IN RESTORATION, PRESCRIBED BURNING, AND HARVESTING. SHORTLEAF PINE'S LACK OF NATURAL REGENERATION IS A FOREST CONSERVATION ISSUE THAT NEEDS PROPER ATTENTION TO RESTORE THE SPECIES. WE EXPECT THIS PROJECT TO GATHER VALUABLE DATA ON THE NATURAL REGENERATION OF SHORTLEAF PINE IN THE FORESTS WITHIN ITS GEOGRAPHIC RANGE. WE WILL DETERMINE OPTIMAL SHORTLEAF PINE DENSITY LEVELS FOR RE-ESTABLISHMENT SPECIES IN THE CENTRAL HARDWOOD REGION AND EXAMINE HOW CROP TREES AND SEED PRODUCTION IMPACT SHORTLEAF PINE NATURAL REGENERATION.

THESE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES ALIGN WITH ONE OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES DEFINED IN THE UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY FY2023 PLAN OF WORK, CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES. FORESTS, RANGELAND, AND AGRICULTURE ARE ALL CLIMATE DEPENDENT. CONSEQUENTLY, ANY CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE WILL REQUIRE THAT PLANTS AND ANIMALS ADAPT TO OR MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. THE MANAGEMENT OF FORESTS AND RANGELAND MUST BE AT THE FOREFRONT IN ADAPTING TO NEW CLIMATE REALITIES, AS WELL AS MITIGATING MANY OF THE INFLUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE CONCEPT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT NEW TO UTAH FOREST MANAGERS. UTAHAN'S HAVE ADJUSTED TO CHANGES IN WATER AND TEMPERATURE FOR MANY YEARS. YET, THERE IS MORE THAT CAN BE DONE TO ENHANCE THE PRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENT OF BOTH FORESTS AND ANIMALS. TREES AND OTHER PLANTS CAN BE MADE MORE RESISTANT TO DROUGHT AND SALINITY THROUGH TRADITIONAL BREEDING PRACTICES, AND THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF GENOMICS. WATER, MUCH OF WHICH ORIGINATES FROM FORESTED WATERSHEDS, WILL BECOME AN EVEN MORE CRITICAL PART OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PROCESSES AS IT BECOMES LESS AVAILABLE AND/OR THE QUALITY BECOMES LESS SUITABLE FOR AGRICULTURE. THE IDEA OF WATER DEPENDENCY UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE CANNOT BE OVER EMPHASIZED AS POPULATIONS INCREASE, AND WATER SHIFTS FROM AGRICULTURAL TO MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL USES. PUBLIC/PRIVATE LAND INTERFACE IS ANOTHER AREA REQUIRING EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND OUTREACH. SIXTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL LAND AVAILABLE IN THE WEST IS PUBLIC LAND, OWNED BY EITHER THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE AREA, RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON INCREASING KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES, PROCESSES AND DELIVERS FOOD, FIBER, AND MYRIAD ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON BIOTECHNOLOGICAL AND MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN CROP AND DAIRY PRODUCTION TO MINIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKET RISKS AND CAPTURING NEW MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES. RESEARCH HERE IS EXPECTED TO GROW WITH THE RECENT HIRING OF A CROP BREEDER FACULTY. FOCUS WILL ALSO BE PLACED ON HELPING THE STATE AND REGION CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY TO BENEFIT THE BLUE ECONOMY.  WORK WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO TARGET ISSUES RELATED TO MITIGATING AND ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE AS A SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THROUGH BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCE, AN EMERGING AREA OF EXCELLENCE IS IN SOIL MICROBIOLOGY, AND THESE EFFORTS WILL BE ONE OF THE CORE OF THE NHAES RESEARCH MISSION IN CLIMATE SCIENCE. A SECOND CORE AREA IS IN WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WATER AND AGRICULTURAL LAND AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. FOOD SAFETY IS AN AREA IN WHICH LESS RESEARCH IS EXPECTED THAN IN THE PAST. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH THAT WILL CONTINUE WILL FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE GROWING AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO MANAGING PATHOGENS IN SHELLFISH.

UVM'S FORESTRY PROGRAM AND HISTORY OVER 75% OF VERMONT'S LAND AREA IS COVERED BY FORESTS. THESE FORESTED LANDS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PROTECTING WATERSHEDS, MAINTAINING BIODIVERSITY, SEQUESTERING CARBON, AND SUPPORTING RURAL, WORKING LANDSCAPES. FORESTRY AS A FIELD OF STUDY HAS HAD A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED HISTORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT WITH FORESTRY COURSES TAUGHT HERE SINCE 1888, WITH ONLY A BRIEF HIATUS DURING WORLD WAR II. THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1946 AND THE PROGRAM IS NOW A PART OF RSENR AND ACCREDITED BY THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN FORESTERS. THE PROGRAM PREPARES STUDENTS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE, AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS NEEDED TO HELP SOLVE THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS FACING FOREST ECOSYSTEMS, SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT, AND CONSERVATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY.

THE PROJECT OBJECTIVE IS TO SURVEY THE NATIVE POLLINATORS FOUND IN PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS IN THE BLACK HILLS AND THE ADJACENT PINE RIDGE. THE SURVEY WILL COVER MORE THAN JUST BEES, THE MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATED INSECTS WITH POLLINATION, BUT ALSO SURVEY FOR THE OTHER INSECTS THAT MAY SERVE AS POLLINATORS SUCH AS BEETLES, BUTTERFLIES, AND FLIES. THE SURVEY WILL ALSO BE CONDUCTED IN PINE FOREST STANDS UNDER DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT SO TO DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF HARVESTING AND OTHER PRACTICES ON POLLINATORS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PLANT COMMUNITIES.  THE PROJECT WILL CREATE A REFERENCE COLLECTION OF ALL THE POLLINATOR INSECTS COLLECTED FROM THE VARIOUS LOCATIONS AND UNDER DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT. THIS COLLECTION WILL BE A BASELINE FOR NOTING CHANGES IN SPECIES DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OVER TIME. THE IMPACT OF FOREST MANAGEMENT ON POLLINATORS WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS OF THE FOREST FROM FOREST LANDOWNERS TO LOGGING CONTRACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL FOREST SERVICE, STATE, AND TRIBAL FORESTERS THOUGH FIELD WORKSHOPS AND VIDEOS POSTED ON THE UNIVERSITY IGROW WEBSITE CALLED TODAYS FOREST. THE INFORMATION ON THE INFLUENCE OF FOREST MANAGEMENT ON POLLINATORS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED FLORA CAN BE USED BY LAND MANAGERS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF LOGGING OPERATIONS.  IMPACTS OF LAND USE AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON NORTH AMERICAN RIVER OTTER DISTRIBUTION, HABITAT USE, AND PROJECTED RECOVERY RIPARIAN AREAS PROVIDE SOME OF THE ONLY NATIVE FOREST IN EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA AND MAKE UP LESS THAN 4% OF LAND AREA. HOWEVER, THEY PROVIDE CRITICAL HABITAT, MOVEMENT CORRIDORS, AND RESOURCES FOR WILDLIFE, IN ADDITION TO IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. AS A RESULT, RIPARIAN AREAS HAVE IMPACTS ON SURROUNDING ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATE TO THEIR AREA ON THE LANDSCAPE. YET THESE ECOSYSTEMS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO HUMAN IMPACTS, WHICH MAY DIMINISH THEIR FUNCTIONALITY. FOR EXAMPLE, LIVESTOCK WILL PREFERENTIALLY GRAZE RIPARIAN VEGETATION, RESULTING IN LOSS OF GROUND COVER AND SHIFTS IN VEGETATION COMMUNITY AND STRUCTURE. IN TURN, THESE CHANGES IN VEGETATION CAN RESULT IN INCREASED EROSION AND THE DESTABILIZATION OF STREAMBANKS. THESE ACTIONS NOT ONLY ALTER HABITAT QUALITY AND RESOURCE ACCESSIBILITY FOR PRAIRIE WILDLIFE, BUT INCREASE RUNOFF AND REDUCE WATER FILTRATION, THEREBY INCREASING SEDIMENT IN WATER. THESE PROCESSES DEGRADE WATER QUALITY AND INCREASE WATER TEMPERATURE, AND MAY HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON FISH POPULATIONS. THESE EFFECTS FURTHER ALTER THE VALUE OF RIPARIAN AREAS TO WILDLIFE THROUGH LOSS OF OVERHEAD TREE CANOPY AND RESULTANT RIVER SHADING, LOSS OF WOODY DEBRIS WITHIN WATERBODIES, AND STREAMBANK ALTERATION THAT MAY CAUSE CHANGES IN RIVER DEPTH AND TORTUOSITY.  FLOODPLAINS ASSOCIATED WITH RIPARIAN AREAS OFTEN PROVIDE RICH SOILS AND HIGH WATER TABLES, MAKING THEM ALSO ATTRACTIVE FOR ROW CROP AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION. THUS, LARGE TRACTS OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION HAVE BEEN CLEARED AND CONVERTED INTOCROP PRODUCTION, WHICH HAS HAD SIMILAR IMPACTS ON RIPARIAN AREAS AND RIVERINE SYSTEMS AS OVERGRAZING (I.E. HABITAT LOSS, INCREASED EROSION, REDUCED WATER QUALITY). FURTHER, CLEARING OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION FOR STREAMSIDE DEVELOPMENT, BANK STABILIZATION, AND RIVER CHANNELIZATION HAVE DRAMATICALLY ALTERED RIPARIAN SYSTEM FUNCTION AND HABITAT QUALITY IN URBANIZED AREAS. THESE ALTERATIONS HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON FISH AND SMALL MAMMALS, AND ALTER HABITAT QUALITY FOR PASSERINES AND WATERFOWL, BUT WHETHER IMPACTS ARE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE FOR AVIAN SPECIES DEPENDS ON THE SPECIES AND SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. MEASURES TO PROTECT RIPARIAN AREAS, LIKE BUFFER ZONES, CROSSFENCING, AND ROTATIONAL GRAZING HAVE GAINED POPULARITY, AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON FISH, SMALL MAMMALS, AND BIRDS; HOWEVER, INFORMATION ON HOW THESE PRACTICES IMPACT OTHER WILDLIFE SPECIES REMAINS LIMITED.  NORTH AMERICAN RIVER OTTERS ARE OBLIGATE USERS OF AQUATIC HABITATS AND PREFER WATERWAYSAGEMENT AT LARGER SCALES. FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED RIVER OTTER HABITAT NEEDS IN HIGHLY MODIFIED PRAIRIE LANDSCAPES, NOR THE IMPACTS OF GRAZING PRACTICES AND OTHER LAND MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES ON RIVER OTTER HABITAT. IN OTHER REGIONS, RIVER OTTER ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FORESTED RIPARIAN AREAS, USING AREAS WITH HIGH TREE COVER, LARGER TREES, AND AVOIDING AREAS OF HIGH HERBACEOUS AND SHRUB COVER AND HIGH ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE. PREY AVAILABILITY (I.E., FISH) ALSO INFLUENCES RIVER OTTER HABITAT QUALITY AND PREY SPECIES ARE DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND RESOURCES PROVIDED BY  RIPARIAN AREAS (E.G., WATER FILTRATION, WOODY DEBRIS, SHADE) AND WATER QUALITY. THEREFORE, GRAZING AND LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT ALTER THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF RIPARIAN AREAS, AND IN PARTICULAR RIPARIAN FORESTS, MAY HAVE LARGE IMPACTS ON RIVER OTTER. CLEARLY, UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF LAND USE AND LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON RIVER OTTER HABITAT IS CRITICAL FOR SPECIES MANAGEMENT AND TO ENSURE CONTINUED POPULATION RECOVERY.  IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING HABITAT, RIVERINE SYSTEMS ACT AS IMPORTANT MOVEMENT CORRIDORS FOR RIVER OTTER, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHAT BARRIER FEATURES MAY LIMIT OF RIVER OTTER MOVEMENT. FURTHER, THERE IS A LACK OF INFORMATION ON EXPECTED COLONIZATION ROUTES AND POTENTIALLY SUITABLE HABITAT IN SOUTH DAKOTA FOR THIS RECOVERING SPECIES. MORE GENERALLY, THEIR PRESENT DISTRIBUTION IN THE STATE IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF RIVER OTTER DISTRIBUTION IS BASED LARGELY ON REPORTED SIGHTINGS AND SURVEYS ALONG THE BIG SIOUX RIVER, WHICH ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITED AND PRONE TO BIAS WITHOUT CORRECTIONS FOR EFFORT AND VARIABLE DETECTION PROBABILITIES. UNDERSTANDING THE FEATURES OF RIVERINE AND RIPARIAN SYSTEMS THAT INFLUENCE MOVEMENT AND CONNECTIVITY, THE AMOUNT AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF POTENTIALLY SUITABLE HABITAT IN THE STATE, AND THE PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF RIVER OTTERS, WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW POPULATION RECOVERY IS LIKELY TO OCCUR ACROSS THE STATE, AND MORE BROADLY ACROSS NORTH AMERICA AND FOR INFORMING REGIONAL HARVEST RESTRICTIONS.  GOAL: EXAMINE HOW HABITAT STRUCTURE, LAND USE, AND LAND MANAGEMENT INFLUENCE THE VALUE OF RIPARIAN AREAS, INCLUDING RIPARIAN FORESTS, TO A RARE FURBEARER, THE NORTH AMERICAN RIVER OTTER. OBJECTIVE 1. ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF STREAMBANK LAND USE, LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, HABITAT STRUCTURE, AND WATER QUALITY ON RIVER OTTER HABITAT USE AND COLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION DYNAMICS. OBJECTIVE 2. MODEL THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION OF RIVER OTTER IN SOUTH DAKOTA USING DATA ON RIVER OTTER PRESENCE COLLECTED FROM SIGHTINGS, HARVEST RECORDS, STATE WILDLIFE SURVEY DATA, AND CAMERA TRAP DATA. OBJECTIVE 3. MODEL AND CREATE PREDICTIVE MAPS OF LANDSCAPE SUITABILITY FOR RIVER OTTER FROM SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS. OBJECTIVE 4. MODEL AND CREATE PREDICTIVE MAPS OF LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY FOR RIVER OTTER, IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY, AND IDENTIFY LIKELY CORRIDORS FOR RIVER OTTERRANGE EXPANSION.  TARGET AUDIENCE: THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL HELP GUIDE POLICY REGARDING MANAGEMENT OF RIVER OTTER AND OTHER RIPARIAN AND RIVERINE ANIMALS IN SOUTH DAKOTA AND BEYOND. SPECIFIC FINDINGS WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO WILDLIFE MANAGERS, SUCH AS THE SOUTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF GAME FISH AND PARKS, NON-PROFIT INTEREST GROUPS, TRAPPERS, PUBLIC, AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. FINDINGS WILL BE RELATED TO MANAGERS AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH A FREELY AVAILABLE WEB APPLICATION. TARGETED OUTREACH TO LANDOWNERS AND THE PUBLIC TO INCREASE ENGAGEMENT, AWARENESS, AND USE OF SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES WILL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, PAMPHLETS,  AND PRESENTATIONS. KNOWLEDGE GAINED AND DEVELOPMENT OF MAPS AND A WEB APP WILL ALSO BE INCORPORATED INTO UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE CURRICULA.  OUTCOMES: THESE FINDINGS WILL AID IN IDENTIFYING: 1) MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT MIGHT IMPROVE RIPARIAN AREAS FOR RIVER OTTER AND OTHER SPECIES, 2) AREAS WHERE RIVER OTTER POPULATIONS ARE EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING, WHICH WILL AID IN SETTING SUSTAINABLE HARVEST LIMITS AND JUSTIFY EXITING HARVEST REGULATIONS, 3) HIGH QUALITY RIPARIAN HABITAT ACROSS THE STATE 4) BARRIERS TO RIVER OTTER POPULATION EXPANSION ACROSS THE STATE, AND 5) LIKELY COLONIZATION ROUTES WHICH MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS.  EFFECTS OF RUSSIAN OLIVE INVASION ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY RIPARIAN AND AQUATIC HABITATS. MAINTAINING RIPARIAN ZONES - THE INTERFACE BETWEEN TERRESTRIAL AND RIVER OR STREAM ECOSYSTEMS - IS ESSENTIAL TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF HUMAN LAND USE ON AQUATIC SYSTEMS. CONSERVATION OF RIPARIAN ZONES IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATE TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION ON THE LANDSCAPE. FOR EXAMPLE, RIPARIAN ZONES SERVE AS CORRIDORS FOR WILDLIFE MIGRATION, ARE HOTSPOTS OF BIODIVERSITY, AND PROVIDE CRITICAL HABITATS FOR ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT GAME SPECIES SUCH AS WATERFOWL, WHITETAIL DEER, AND RING-NECKED PHEASANTS. ADDITIONALLY, RIPARIAN ZONES REDUCE THE IMPACT OF FLOODING, STORE NUTRIENTS, REGULATE WATER TEMPERATURE, AND ACT AS A FILTER TO REDUCE SEDIMENTATION AND POLLUTION. RIPARIAN ZONES FACE MANY STRESSORS, AND LITTLE UNDISTURBED RIPARIAN HABITAT REMAINS ON THE LANDSCAPE. GIVEN THE MANY SERVICES THAT RIPARIAN HABITATS PROVIDE, THEIR RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. RIPARIAN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION IS INHERENTLY LINKED TO FLUVIAL PROCESSES SUCH AS SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND FLOODING. HYDROLOGIC ALTERATIONS CAUSED BY DAMS, RIVER REGULATION, AND WATER EXTRACTION ALTER FLOODING REGIMES, RIVER CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY, AND CONNECTIVITY WHICH CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION IN BOTH RIPARIAN ZONES AND AQUATIC HABITATS. HUMAN LAND USE SUCH AS CROP CULTIVATION, LOGGING, AND GRAZING CAN ALSO DISTURB RIPARIAN AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. SUCH HUMAN DISTURBANCES CAN FACILITATE THE INTRODUCTION AND PROLIFERATIONOF NON-NATIVE SPECIES, AND RIPARIAN ZONES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY INVADED GLOBALLY. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF HUMAN DISTURBANCE ON RIPARIAN INVASION, AND CORRESPONDING IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY AQUATIC AND RIPARIAN HABITATS.  RIPARIAN FORESTS ACROSS THE GREAT PLAINS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPACTED BY INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES. THIS PHENOMENON IS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED IN ARID REGIONS OF THE WESTERN GREAT PLAINS. RUSSIAN OLIVE, ELAEAGNUS AGUSTIFOLIA, IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN AS A RIPARIAN INVASIVE SPECIES BECAUSE THEY SPREAD QUICKLY, HAVE HIGH WATER DEMANDS, ALTER NUTRIENT DYNAMICS, AND ACT AS ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS. RUSSIAN OLIVE IS A KEY FACTOR DRIVING DECLINES IN NATIVE RIPARIAN PLANT COMMUNITIES, PRIMARILY COTTONWOOD AND WILLOW, ALONG RIVERS AND STREAMS IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, RUSSIAN OLIVE REQUIRES SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS TO GERMINATE, LIKELY LIMITING THEIR DISTRIBUTION. IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID ENVIRONMENTS THESE INVADERS ARE RESTRICTED MOSTLY TO RIPARIAN HABITATS. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPACTS ON RIPARIAN VEGETATION COMPOSITION, RUSSIAN OLIVE INVASION CAN ALSO REDUCE STREAM HABITAT COMPLEXITY, ALTER AQUATIC NUTRIENT CYCLING, FACILITATE AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES, AND IMPACT AQUATIC FOOD WEBS. LITTER FROM RUSSIAN OLIVE LEAVES IS SLOW TO DE COMPOSE AND CONTAINS MANY TANNINS MAKING THEN LESS PALATABLE AND LOWER QUALITY FORAGE FOR CONSUMERS COMPARED TO NATIVE VEGETATION. INCREASES IN RUSSIAN OLIVE LITTER INTO STREAMS HAS BEEN LINKED TO INCREASED NUTRIENT EXPORTS, RESULTING IN LOSS OF ECOSYSTEM EFFICIENCY. GIVEN THE MANY POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF RUSSIAN OLIVE INVASION ON RIPARIAN AND AQUATIC HABITATS, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW HUMAN DISTURBANCE IMPACTS INVASION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF RUSSIAN OLIVE TREES IN RIPARIAN HABITATS AND TO PREDICT AREAS THAT ARE AT RISK FOR INVASION IN THE FUTURE.  THE CONNECTIVITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF RIPARIAN AND AQUATIC HABITATS AFFECTS THE RECIPROCAL MOVEMENT OF RESOURCES BETWEEN AND ACROSS E COSYSTEM BOUNDARIES. RIPARIAN HABITATS SERVE AS CONDUITS FOR THE FLUX OF MATERIALS AND ENERGY BETWEEN TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC HABITATS, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW RIPARIAN INVASION AFFECTS THE CONNECTIVITY AND FLOW OF RESOURCES ACROSS PERMEABLE HABITAT BOUNDARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, RESOURCES SUCH AS EMERGING INSECTS AND FLUVIAL NUTRIENTS SUSTAIN DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS ADJACENT TO RIVERS AND STREAMS. CONVERSELY, MOVEMENT OF RIPARIAN DETRITUS AND INVERTEBRATE PREY SUBSIDIZES AQUATIC PRODUCTION, AND MANY AQUATIC SPECIES ARE ADAPTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE RESOURCES. HUMAN DISTURBANCE CAN ALTER BOTH THE TIMING AND QUANTITY OF RESOURCE FLUX WHICH CAN HAVE CASCADING EFFECTS ON CONSUMER ABUNDANCE AND FOOD WEB STRUCTURE. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF RUSSIAN OLIVE INVASION ON RESOURCE FLUXES BETWEEN AQUATIC AND TERRESTRIAL HABITATS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. THE RESEARCHIN THIS PROPOSAL WILL INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW RIPARIAN INVASION BY RUSSIAN OLIVE ALTERS RESOURCE FLUX AND FOOD WEB STRUCTURE IN RECIPIENT ECOSYSTEMS.  UNDERSTANDING THE THREATS THAT RIPARIAN FORESTS FACE ACROSS THE GREAT PLAINS IS ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT THESE HABITATS PROVIDE. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS: OBJECTIVE 1: DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN DISTURBANCE AND RUSSIAN OLIVE OCCUPANCY ACROSS THE GREAT PLAINS REGION AND PREDICT AREAS LIKELY TO BE INVADED UNDER FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIOS OBJECTIVE 2: EVALUATE THE IMPACTS OF RIPARIAN FOREST INVASION BY RUSSIAN OLIVE ON NUTRIENT CYCLING AND FOOD WEBS IN AQUATIC AND RIPARIAN HABITATS OBJECTIVE 3: ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF RUSSIAN OLIVE INVASION IN RIPARIAN FORESTS ON THE RECIPROCAL FLUX OF RESOURCES BETWEEN RIPARIAN AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS  THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THE MCINTIRE-STENNIS RESEARCH AREAS INCLUDING 1) \"MANAGEMENT OF FOREST AND RELATED WATERSHED LANDS TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS OF WATER FLOW AND TO PROTECT RESOURCES AGAINST FLOODS AND EROSION,\" AND 2) \"MANAGEMENT OF FOREST AND RELATED RANGELAND FOR PRODUCTION OF FORAGE FOR DOMESTIC LIVESTOCK AND GAME AND IMPROVEMENT OF FOOD AND HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE.\" THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO ADDRESS THE STRATEGIC GOALS OF THE MCINTIRE-STENNIS PROGRAM BY: 1) TRAINING GRADUATE STUDENTS TO CREATE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF SCIENTISTS TO STUDY RIPARIAN FORESTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH AQUATIC RESOURCES; AND 2) BY COMMUNICATING THE RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES TO RESOURCE MANAGERS, POLICY MAKERS, AND THE PUBLIC THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OF PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS, GRADUATE THESES, CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS, AND REPORTS.  USING THE WOODLAND MODEL SYSTEM SILENE-HADENA TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON SPECIES INTERACTIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF BIODIVERSITY THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW CLIMATE CHANGE MAY DISRUPT PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO MAINTENANCE OF BIODIVERSITY ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. IN THE FACE OF RAPID CLIMATE CHANGE, MANY SPECIES ARE DECLINING OR UNDERGOING RANGE SHIFTS, ENDANGERING BIODIVERSITY AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IT SUPPORTS. SHIFTS IN PHENOLOGY, OR TIMING OF ACTIVITY, CAN ALSO RESULT FROM CHANGING PATTERNS OF WARMING AND PRECIPITATION. WHEN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARISE FROM INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SPECIES, PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCHES BETWEEN THEM CAN RESULT IN A LOSS OF SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE DECLINE OF INTERACTING SPECIES. PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS ARE ONE SUCH SYSTEM THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER THREAT FROM SHIFTING PHENOLOGY. SURVIVAL OF INDIVIDUAL PLANTS AND POLLINATORS IS OFTEN DEPENDENT UPON PHENOLOGICAL SYNCHRONY WITH FLORAL RESOURCES (E.G., NECTAR AND POLLEN) FOR SUCCESSFUL REPRODUCTION OR POLLINATION. PLANTS AND THEIR POLLINATORS, HOWEVER, MAY RESPOND PHENOLOGICALLY TO DIFFERENT CLIMATIC CUES, RESULTING IN IMPACTS ON THEIR COMMUNITY AND MAINTENANCE OF BIODIVERSITY AT A BROADER SCALE. WHILE THE IMPORTANCE OF PLANTS AND POLLINATORS TO EACH OTHER IS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "SD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e4dcf3ad-0730-1e57-249e-8c0f96bb1f40-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_NI23MSCFRXXXG014_12H3"}, {"internal_id": 154736168, "Award ID": "NI23MSCFRXXXG013", "Award Amount": 510990.0, "Award Type": "FORMULA GRANT (A)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-11-16", "CFDA Number": "10.202", "Description": "THE HISTORY OF FORESTRY RESEARCH IS LONG AT RUTGERS UNIVERSITY, FORMALLY PREDATING THE MCINTIRE STENNIS ACT OF 1962 BY A MINIMUM OF TWO DECADES. THE FIRST NOTABLE MENTION OF FORESTRY AS A SELECT RESEARCH CATEGORY OF ITS OWN WAS IN THE 1941?1942 NEW JERSEY AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION ANNUAL REPORT TITLED \"FARM SCIENCE GOES TO WAR.\" IN IT, QUESTIONS WERE ASKED AND ANSWERED SUCH AS \"WHAT CONTRIBUTIONS IN STRATEGIC MATERIALS WILL NEW JERSEY FARM WOODLANDS MAKE TOWARD OUR WAR EFFORT?\" AND \"HOW DOES RESEARCH ON TREE DISEASES HELP IN THE WAR EFFORT?\"  FORESTRY RESEARCH BECAME KEY IN THAT ERA AS THEY NOTED THAT AN ESTIMATED 45000?50000 TREES PER YEAR WILL NEED TO BE HARVESTED FOR THE WAR - DOUBLING ANY PREVIOUS YEAR'S HARVEST. THE NEXT YEAR'S NJAES ANNUAL REPORT TITLED \"FARM SCIENCE IN WAR AND PEACE\" ALREADY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT \"THE SUPPLY OF LUMBER IS VERY SHORT\" AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD WOODLAND MANAGEMENT. PINE SAWFLY LARVAE AND THE NEWLY DISCOVERED SWEET GUM (LIQUIDAMBAR STRYACIFLUA) FUNGUS WERE TWO OF THE NOTABLE FORESTRY CONCERNS OF THIS TIME.  FORESTRY EDUCATION AT RUTGERS GOES BACK EVEN FURTHER, WITH REFERENCES IN THE 1920S OF HORTICULTURE STUDENTS LOOKING FORWARD TO STUDYING FORESTRY AT THE COLLEGE. WITH THIS HISTORY, RUTGERS EASILY QUALIFIED FOR THE USDA REQUIREMENTS TO RECEIVE MCINTIRE?STENNIS FUNDING FROM THE BEGINNING. \"EVALUATION OF THE MULTIPLE USES OF NEW JERSEY'S PUBLIC FOREST LAND RESOURCES\" BY RICHARD F. WEST AND BENJAMIN B. STOUT WAS APPROVED AS THE FIRST FIVE?YEAR NJAES MCINTIRE STENNIS PROJECT ON MAY 25, 1964. DESPITE BEING THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED STATE IN THE U.S., FORESTED LAND COMPRISES A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF LAND AREA IN NEW JERSEY. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS FROM THE U. S. FORESTRY SERVICE THERE ARE 1,989,650 ACRES OF FORESTED LAND IN NEW JERSEY, A 1.3% INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY RELEASED IN 2011. MOST OF THIS FORESTED LAND (52%) IS PUBLICLY OWNED AND 87 PERCENT OF NEW JERSEY'S FORESTLAND CONSISTS OF TIMBERLAND. WHILE THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL TIMBER INDUSTRY IN NEW JERSEY, THESE FORESTS SERVE OTHER IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS. NEW JERSEY'S FORESTS PROVIDE WATERSHED RESTORATION AND PRESERVATION, DIVERSE WILDLIFE, CARBON SEQUESTRATION, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, AND RECREATIONAL SPACE.  MCINTIRE?STENNIS FUNDS ARE USED PRODUCTIVELY AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR OUR RESEARCH SCIENTISTS AND STAFF TO DEVELOP NEW RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT SOLVE EMERGING FORESTRY?RELATED ISSUES. NJAES IS IN THE PROCESS OF EXPANDING ITS MCINTIRE?STENNIS PROJECT PORTFOLIO, WITH NEW INNOVATIVE PROJECTS STUDYING EFFECTIVE LAND?USE TOOLS, DEVELOPING THE EXPLORING WILD BEE POLLINATOR PRESERVATION, AND DEVELOPING NEW EDNA METHODS OF TRACKING INVASIVE PESTS WHICH CAN CRITICALLY DAMAGE FORESTS.  NJAES WILL USE ADMINISTRATIVE MCINTIRE?STENNIS FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT POLICIES GOVERNING RESEARCH PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND EXPENDITURE OF MCINTIRE?STENNIS FORMULA FUNDS ARE MET.

IT IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF SEVERAL FOREST COVERS AND IS CONSIDERED A \"CLIMAX SPECIES\" ALL OVER ITS FAR-REACHING NATIVE RANGE (KHODWEKAR ET AL. 2015). IT IS A MONOECIOUS, DICHOGAMOUS, WIND-POLLINATED, AND SHADE-TOLERANT HARDWOOD TREE, THAT HAS  A MAJOR ECONOMIC VALUE IN THE UNITED STATES. DESPITE, ITS GREAT VALUE, THE GENETIC AND GENOMIC RESOURCES FOR THIS SPECIES ARE VERY LIMITED. SUGAR MAPLE TREES HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO BE SENSITIVE TO DROUGHT STRESS (LEGAULT ET AL., 2019), AND MANY STUDIES CONDUCTED IN THE 20TH-CENTURY ARTICULATE THAT SUGAR MAPLE DECLINE IS FREQUENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DROUGHT (HORSLEY ET AL., 2002). WITH THE ANTICIPATED CLIMATE CHANGE, SEVERAL MODELS HAVE PREDICTED A DECREASE IN SUGAR MAPLE VEGETATION AT THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF ITS RANGE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO PROGRESSIVE GENETIC EROSION, POPULATION FRAGMENTATION, AND LOSS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY IN THE SOUTHERN POPULATIONS (IVERSON ET AL. 2008). THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO GENERATE GENETIC AND GENOMIC RESOURCES WITH THE APPLICATION OF NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS) TECHNOLOGIES TO FACILITATE FUTURE POPULATION GENETIC STUDIES.

WE INTEND TO ALLOCATE UP TO 10% OF THE TOTAL M-S FUNDING AWARDED TO CAL POLY HUMBOLDT FOR THIS PROJECT TO SUPPORT RESEARCH PLANNING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. THE BUDGET ITEMS FOR THIS PROJECT INCLUDE STAFF SALARY AND BENEFITS, TRAVEL TO ATTEND MEETINGS, SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT, AND PUBLICATION CHARGES. 2) YEAR-5 ASSESSMENT OF REPLICATED UNEVEN-AGED DOUGLAS-FIR/TANOAK SILVICULTURE EXPERIMENT ALONG NORTHERN CALIFORNIA'S COAST RANGE PROJECT DIRECTOR: PASCAL BERRILL THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WILL COMPARE DIFFERENT METHODS OF CONVERTING DEGRADED TIMBERLANDS INTO HEALTHY, VIGOROUS, AND RESILIENT FORESTS THAT SEQUESTER MORE CARBON PER ACRE ANNUALLY AND AVOID LOSS OF STORED CARBON FROM CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. DRY FORESTS OF CALIFORNIA'S COAST RANGE WERE LOGGED THROUGHOUT THE 1900S AND LEFT TO REGENERATE NATURALLY WITH HARDWOOD (MAINLY TANOAK) AND CONIFER (MAINLY DOUGLAS-FIR) SEEDLINGS. ONCE DOMINATED BY LARGE CONIFERS, THE DRY FORESTS NOW HAVE AN OVER-ABUNDANCE OF HARDWOODS. MANY OF THESE FORESTS HAVE BECOME CROWDED WHICH POSES A RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE WHERE CO2 GAS IS RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE BY BURNING OF CARBONSTORED IN WOOD AND DECAY OF UNBURNED WOOD IN FIRE-KILLED TREES. COAST RANGE DRY FORESTS CONTAIN MANY OF THE STATE'S \"COMMUNITIES AT RISK FROM WILDFIRE\" (FRAP.FIRE.CA.GOV). CURRENT OWNERSHIP PATTERNS AND FOREST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES INCLUDE SMALL UNMANAGED PRIVATE HOLDINGS, INDUSTRIAL FORESTRY COMPANIES HARVESTING CONIFERS AND USING HERBICIDE TO CONTROL HARDWOODS, AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT OWNERS SUCH AS THE CONSERVATION FUND, REDWOOD FOREST FOUNDATION, AND SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION INC. WHO MANAGE FORESTS FOR ECOSYSTEM AND COMMUNITY VALUES AND BENEFITS INCLUDING TIMBER PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION, AND PROCESSING. VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT AFFECTS POTENTIAL WILDFIRE BEHAVIOR IN THIS IMPORTANT WIDESPREAD CALIFORNIA FOREST TYPE. FIVE YEARS AGO, MY RESEARCH GROUP DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A REPLICATED FIELD EXPERIMENT ACROSS 120+ ACRES AT FOUR SITES LOCATED ALONG A NORTH-SOUTH GRADIENT THROUGHOUT THE COAST RANGE OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OUR GOAL WAS TO DEMONSTRATE ANDQUANTIFY GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED BY FOREST RESTORATION. WE ARE TESTING DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF RESTORATION TREATMENT OPTIONS THAT ENHANCE CARBON SEQUESTRATION BY FAVORING FAST-GROWING CONIFERS OVER HARDWOODS, AND REMOVE OR MODIFY THE ARRANGEMENT OF FLAMMABLE HARVEST RESIDUES (SURFACE FUELS). TREATMENT COMBINATIONS TESTED IN THIS LARGE, LONG-TERM EXPERIMENT INCLUDE A SILVICULTURAL TREATMENT IMPLEMENTED BY PARTIAL HARVESTING, WITH AND WITHOUT HERBICIDE TREATMENT OF HARDWOODS, COMBINED WITH A VIABLE FUELS REDUCTION TREATMENT (I.E., LOP+SCATTER, BIOMASS REMOVAL) THAT DISPOSES OF - OR REARRANGES - FUELS TO MITIGATE EXTREME WILDFIRE BEHAVIOR. SUBSEQUENT UNDERPLANTING WITH CONIFER SEEDLINGS CREATES A NEW AGE-CLASS OF TREES IN THE RESTORED FOREST. IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO RE-VISIT THE EXPERIMENT AFTER 5 YEARS AND RE-MEASURE TREES AND FUELS TO QUANTIFY GROWTH OF TREES AND SEEDLINGS, AND THE ARRANGEMENT AND DECAY RATE OF FUELS, AND HOW THIS HAS CHANGED OVER TIME FOR EACH TREATMENT COMBINATION. THESE DATA WILL ALLOW US TO SEEK FUNDING TO CONDUCT A FOLLOW-ON STUDY WHERE WE SIMULATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE WITH THE GOAL OF IDENTIFYING FOREST AND FUELS TREATMENTS THAT MITIGATE WILDFIRE IMPACTS WHILE ALSO SUSTAINING TIMBER PRODUCTION AND VIABLE REGENERATION OF A NEW AGE CLASS OF TREE SEEDLINGS. ONE GRADUATE STUDENT AND MULTIPLE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT ASSISTANTS WILL BE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THIS APPLIED RESEARCH PROJECT OF INTEREST TO STUDENTS, SMALL PRIVATE TIMBERLAND LANDOWNERS, FOREST MANAGERS, FOREST AND FIRE SCIENTISTS, AND POLICYMAKERS. 3) TREE RESPONSES TO WILDFIRE AND DROUGHT IN A CONIFER DIVERSITY HOTSPOT PROJECT DIRECTOR: LUCY KERHOULAS AND ROSEMARY SHERRIFF WILDFIRES AND DROUGHT HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER RECENT DECADES IN THE WESTERN U.S., CREATING SUBSTANTIAL FOREST MORTALITY WITH WIDE-REACHING IMPACTS AFFECTING RURAL ECONOMIES, NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS, WATER RESOURCES, AND THE HEALTH OF RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. U.S. FORESTS CURRENTLY FACE UNPRECEDENTED THREATS DUE TO HEAVY FUEL LOADS FROM DECADES OF FIRE SUPPRESSION, RECENT DROUGHT-INDUCED MORTALITY, AND LONGER FIRE SEASONS RESULTING FROM EARLIER SNOWMELT AND LOW PRECIPITATION. A NEW PARADIGM TO LEVERAGE WILDFIRES AS PRE-TREATMENTS TO SUBSEQUENT THINNING AND PRESCRIBED BURNING MAY INCREASE FOREST RESILIENCE TO CHANGING CLIMATE AND DISTURBANCE REGIMES, ALTHOUGH THIS POTENTIAL SOLUTION REMAINS LARGELY UNTESTED. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW PRECEDING WILDFIRE SEVERITY AFFECTS FOREST RESPONSES TO EXTENDED DROUGHT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON EVALUATING THE DROUGHT RESPONSES (2013-2015 AND 2020-2022) OF SIX DIVERSE CONIFER SPECIES ACROSS 54 SITES IN VARIED HABITATS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT EXPERIENCED NO FIRE, LOW-SEVERITY FIRE, AND MODERATE-SEVERITY FIRE IN 2008, A YEAR WHEN 1.6 MILLION ACRES BURNED IN THE STATE. AT EACH RANDOMLY-LOCATED STUDY SITE, TREE GROWTH, DROUGHT RESISTANCE, AND DROUGHT RESILIENCE WILL BE MEASURED. METHODS WILL INCLUDE DENDROCHRONOLOGY AND SITE INVENTORY DATA. THIS PROJECT WILL INVOLVE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AT A PREDOMINANTLY UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTION AND WILL HAVE EXTENSIVE AND CREATIVE DISSEMINATION OUTLETS TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL DESCRIBE TREE RESPONSES TO WILDFIRE AND DROUGHT DISTURBANCES, PROVIDING APPLIED KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL IMPROVE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS TO FOSTER SUSTAINABLE, PRODUCTIVE, AND RESILIENT LANDSCAPES. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS A WORLD-RENOWNED CONIFER DIVERSITY HOTSPOT AND IS HEAVILY TIED TO FORESTS CULTURALLY, SOCIALLY, POLITICALLY, AND ECONOMICALLY. AT PRESENT, NUMEROUS NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES THRIVE ON THESE LANDS AND HAVE RELIED ON THESE FORESTS SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. THUS, IT IS CRITICAL THAT MANAGEMENT EFFORTS ARE IMPROVED TO PERPETUATE THIS VALUABLE NATURAL RESOURCE. THIS STUDY WILL USE DENDROCHRONOLOGY TO EVALUATE FOREST RESPONSES TO THE INTERACTING EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE AND DROUGHT,TWO INCREASINGLY DOMINANT DISTURBANCES IN THE WEST, ON NUMEROUS CONIFER SPECIES UNDER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF FOREST CONDITIONS TO ELUCIDATE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS DRIVING OBSERVED TRENDS. THIS WORK WILL INCLUDE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT, YOUNG SCIENTIST TRAINING, KNOWLEDGE SHARING, AND EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH. TO ADVANCE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, THIS WORK WILL INFORM ON THE INTERACTING IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE AND DROUGHT ON FOREST SPECIES IN A BIODIVERSE AND CULTURALLY IMPORTANT REGION. RESULTS WILL HELP HONE SILVICULTURE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THE JOINT GOALS OF TIMBER OPTIMIZATION AND IMPROVED FOREST RESILIENCE AND WILL STRENGTHEN ASSESSMENTS OF REGIONAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION CAPACITY. TO MENTOR AND TRAIN YOUNG SCIENTISTS, ONE MASTER OF SCIENCE STUDENT AND AT LEAST ONE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT WILL WORK CLOSELY ON THIS PROJECT WITH THE PIS. A FOCUS ON THE RECRUITMENT OF UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN THIS PROJECT WILL BE A PRIORITY. STUDENTS WILL BE INVOLVED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT INCLUDING FIELD AND LAB WORK, DATA ANALYSIS, WRITING, PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS, AND OUTREACH. TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE WITH LAND MANAGERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES, THE PIS WILL COORDINATE WITH LOCAL, STATE, REGIONAL, AND FEDERAL STAKEHOLDERS, TRIBES, AND AGENCIES TO DISSEMINATE RESULTS VIA PRESENTATIONS, POSTERS, WRITTEN REPORTS, SCIENTIFIC PAPERS, WEBINARS, WORKSHOPS, AND FIELD DAYS. COLLABORATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES WILL STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ACADEMICS, NATURAL RESOURCES GROUPS, NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES, AND STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON MULTIPLE FACETS OF FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT AND WILL THEREFORE UNITE MANY DIVERSE PARTIES VIA A COMMON INTEREST IN THE LANDSCAPE. 4) CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON FOREST AND WATER RESOURCES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PROJECT DIRECTOR: ANDREW STUBBLEFIELD THIS RESEARCH SEEKS TO EVALUATE THE THREAT TO FORESTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. THE DROUGHT OF 2011-2015 KILLED OVER 100 MILLION TREES IN CALIFORNIA, MOSTLY IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE STATE. THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUED SEVERE DROUGHT, EVENTUALLY EFFECTING THE WETTER NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS A REAL ONE. THE SECOND GOAL OF THE RESEARCH IS TO EVALUATE CLIMATE CHANGE THREATS TO WATER RESOURCES PROVIDED BY FOREST COVER. RECENT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN DECLINING SUMMER STREAM FLOWS THROUGHOUT THE REGION, PUNCTUATED BY WET YEARS WITH SOME OF THE LARGEST PRECIPITATION TOTALS SINCE 1888. THE RESEARCH WILL INTEGRATE DATA FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES: FIELD MEASUREMENTS OF SOIL MOISTURE, GROUNDWATER AND RIVER FLOW, SATELLITE-DERIVED SOIL MOISTURE DATA, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RIVER FLOW AND WEATHER DATA, TREE SAPFLOW WATER USE DATA COLLECTED BY THE AUTHOR IN PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS, AND DOWN-SCALED GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE MODEL OUTPUT DATA. THE GOALS ARE TO EVALUATE HOW THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESULTING DROUGHT CONDITIONS LEADING TO LOSSES OF TREE PRODUCTIVITY AND FOREST DISTRIBUTION, CONTINUED DECLINE IN SUMMER WATER AVAILABILITY, IN SOILS, GROUNDWATER AND RIVERS OF THE REGION. FIGURE 1 ILLUSTRATES THE CONCEPTUAL LINKAGES BETWEEN WATER STORAGE COMPARTMENTS IN FORESTED WATERSHEDS. THE PROBLEM ADDRESSED BY THIS RESEARCH IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO MANAGERS OF NATIONAL FORESTS, INDUSTRIAL TIMBERLANDS AND SMALLER FOREST LANDOWNERS. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, TIMBER HARVEST IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF INCOME FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES. THE PROJECT WILL HELP FILL INFORMATION NEEDS FOR FOREST MANAGERS NEEDING PREPARE FOR AND ADAPT TO THE CHANGING CLIMATE. WITH RECENT DROUGHTS OCCURRING IN 2019 AND 2020, AND RESERVOIRS AT CRITICALLY LOW LEVELS ACROSS THE WEST, IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS LOOMING THREAT CANNOT BE IGNORED. THE GREATEST BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE FROM THIS PROJECT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THE QUOTE \"FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED\" (MIGUEL DE CERVANTES). TO THE EXTENT THAT THREATS TO FORESTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM CLIMATE CHANGE ARE VERIFIED FROM THIS RESEARCH, FOREST MANAGERS AND SCIENTISTS CAN TAKE UP SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATIONS, ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND SO FORTH TO PREPARE AND ADAPT. FOR EXAMPLE, PLANTING MORE DROUGHT- RESILIENT TREE SPECIES MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL. FOREST THINNING AND USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE DROUGHT TOLERANCE. DIFFERENT FOREST MANAGEMENT METHODS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE RIVER FLOW. BETTER APPRECIATION OF FLOOD RISK CAN GUIDE LAND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS. THE PROJECT HAS DIRECT RELEVANCE FOR TWO LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED FORESTRY RESEARCH AREAS. THE FIRST AREA IS \"DEVELOPMENT OF SOUND POLICIES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF FOREST LANDS AND THE HARVESTING AND MARKETING OF FOREST PRODUCTS\". BY DEVELOPING SCIENTIFICALLY BASED THREAT-ASSESSMENTS, THIS RESEARCH WILL CONTRIBUTE VITAL INFORMATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOUND FOREST MANAGEMENT POLICIES IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE SECOND AREA IS \"MANAGEMENT OF FOREST AND RELATED WATERSHED LANDS TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS OF WATER FLOW AND TO PROTECT RESOURCES AGAINST FLOODS AND EROSION\". THE EVALUATION OF CHANGING PRECIPITATION REGIMES AND RIVER FLOW LEVELS FROM FORESTED REGIONS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER CHANGES, WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR MANAGING FORESTED WATERSHEDS FOR WATER RESOURCES. BY COMBINING A RANGE OF DATA SETS TO PERFORM A THREAT ASSESSMENT, THE PROJECT DEVELOPS AND UTILIZES THE SCIENCE OF INTEGRATION, AN IDENTIFIED HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE. FURTHERMORE, THE INVESTIGATION OF IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR SOIL MOISTURE, GROUNDWATER, AND RIVER FLOWS IN OUR REGION IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE OF FOREST ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. IMPACTS ON OTHER HIGH PRIORITY AREAS INCLUDE HELPING TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY AND INFORM DECISION-MAKING. 5) RECOVERY OF HUMAN COMMUNITIES AFTER WILDFIRE: BUILDING SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE PROJECT DIRECTOR: ERIN KELLY FOREST FIRE ACTIVITY HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE WESTERN US OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, POSING SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO MANY HUMAN COMMUNITIES. IN CALIFORNIA, SEVEN OF THE TEN LARGEST FIRES, FIVE OF THE TEN MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES, AND THREE OF THE TEN DEADLIEST FIRES IN RECORDED HISTORY OCCURRED WITHIN THE PAST FOUR YEARS. AS HUMAN COMMUNITIES RECOVER FROM THESE WILDFIRES, THEY WILL GO THROUGH PHASES, FROM AN EMERGENCY PERIOD (OF RESCUE AND RELOCATION) TO REHABILITATION (WHEN ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS RE-BUILT) TO RECONSTRUCTION, WHEN LONG-TERM PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL NEEDS OF RESIDENTS ARE ADDRESSED AND THE COMMUNITY ATTEMPTS TO REBUILD IN A WAY THAT INCREASES ITS RESILIENCE. THIS LAST PHASE MAY ALSO BE TERMED LONG-TERM RECOVERY, AND OCCURS 2-3 YEARS AFTER DISASTER, AS COMMUNITY CAPACITY IS RE-BUILT AND LONG-TERM PLANS ARE PUT IN PLACE. POST-WILDFIRE RECOVERY IS MULTIFACETED, AND INCLUDES REBUILDING PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE; RESUMING MUNICIPAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES; AND PROMOTING PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALING AND RECOVERY, AS RESIDENTS STRUGGLE WITH \"LOSSES AND PROLONGED DISTRESS\". THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE RESEARCH ON COMMUNITY RECOVERYSEVERAL YEARS AFTER WILDFIRE. THE TIMELINE OF OUR PROPOSED RESEARCH, 3-4 YEARS AFTER WILDFIRE, WILL ALLOW US TO ASSESS BOTH IMMEDIATE POST-DISASTER COMMUNITY RESPONSES AND MORE LONG-TERM COMMUNITY RECOVERY. RATHER THAN FOCUSING NARROWLY ON THE \"AFTERSHOCK\" SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, WE WILL CONSIDER THE DIRECTION OF RECOVERY WITH SEVERAL YEARS' WORTH OF LESSONS LEARNED. THE TIMELINE OF POST-DISASTER RECOVERY IS IMPORTANT: SOON AFTER DISASTER THERE MAY BE A SENSE OF COMMUNITY COHESION AND WORKING TOGETHER TOWARD COMMON CAUSE , DESCRIBED AS A \"HONEYMOON\" PHASE. THIS SUGGESTS THAT RECOVERY EFFORTS MAY LAG, OR MAY RUN INTO COMMUNITY CONFLICTS, AFTER SOME TIME. BUT WITHIN COMMUNITIES, NEW ACTORS AND LEADERS MAY ALSO EMERGE TO FACILITATE RECOVERY EFFORTS, CONTRIBUTING TO RENEWED SOCIAL COHESION AND COMMUNITY AGENCY. PRIOR RESEARCH FOUND THAT 9 MONTHS AFTER A FIRE IN SWEDEN, THERE WAS STILL INCREASED SOCIAL COHESION AND PEOPLE DESCRIBED THEIR COMMUNITY AS \"STRONGER\" AFTER THE FIRE. IN ONE OF THE FEW STUDIES TO ASSESS COMMUNITY RECOVERY SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE FIRE, THEY FOUND THAT FIVE YEARS AFTER THE RODEO- CHEDISKI FIRE, NEARBY COMMUNITIES HAD BOTH MAINTAINED A \"COMING TOGETHER\" SPIRIT THAT SPURRED COMMUNITY ACTION, AND HAD DEVELOPED POST-FIRE CONFLICT, DISTRUST, AND DISAGREEMENTS. THIS FUNDING WILL HELP US TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FACILITATING IN THE RECOVERY EFFORT, AND TO EXPAND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS NEEDED (WHAT IS WORKING, WHAT IS NOT WORKING) IN TERMS OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY. WE ARE CREATING CASE STUDIES IN THREE COMMUNITIES AND WILL USE FUNDING TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES IN ALL THREE. 6) THE CAPACITY OF NON-SEROTINOUS SEEDS TO SURVIVE FIRE WITHIN MATURE CONES PROJECT DIRECTOR: DAVID GREENE SUMMARY: THE FOREST DENSIFICATION AND WARMING OF THE 20TH CENTURY HAS LED TO INCREASINGLY FREQUENT, LARGE, AND SEVERE PATCHES IN WESTERN FORESTS OF THE US. OWING TO THE PREVIOUS LOW INTENSITY FIRE REGIME CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LAST FEW MILLENNIA, OUR CURRENT SPECIES MIX IS POORLY ADAPTED TO A STANDREPLACING FIRE REGIME (E.G. SEROTINOUS SPECIES PRESENTLY COMPRISE A TINY FRACTION OF THE TREE BIOMASS IN THE FAR WESTERN STATES). IN PARTICULAR, RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN POOR POST-FIRE REGENERATION IN LARGE SEVERE PATCHES, ESPECIALLY AT LOWER ELEVATIONS. NONETHELESS, THINGS MAY NOT BE QUITE SO DIRE; IN PARTICULAR, WE ARGUE THAT UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES NON-SEROTINOUS TREES CAN BEHAVE AS IF THEY WERE SEROTINOUS (WE DEEM THIS \"FACULTATIVE SEROTINY\"). IF SO, THEN THE TRANSITION TO A PREDOMINANTLY SEROTINOUS FOREST MAY BE SLOWER THAN WE MIGHT EXPECT. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL BUILD ON EARLIER WORK, MUCH OF IT UNPUBLISHED, ADVANCING THIS IDEA. IN ADDITION TO ALIGNING WITH THE MAIN RESEARCH AREA (\"REFORESTATION AND MANAGEMENT. . .\"). THE PROPOSED PROJECT ADDRESSES THE HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE OF \"CONFLICT, UNCERTAINTY, AND DECISION-MAKING\" AS IT IS FOCUSED ON DELINEATING THE JOINT PROBABILITIES GOVERNING SEXUAL RECRUITMENT BY CONIFERS IN RECENT BURNS.

OUTREACH AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROGRAMS FACILITATE COORDINATION AMONG SCIENTISTS, AGENCIES, AND INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS. MISSISSIPPI FOREST LANDS PRODUCE MYRIAD FOREST PRODUCTS INCLUDING DIMENSIONAL LUMBER, VENEER, PALLETS, AND PAPER PRODUCTS. SCIENTISTS IN THE FWRC ARE DEVELOPING NEW SUSTAINABLE BIOPRODUCTS INCLUDING; CROSS-LAMINATED TIMBERS, BIO-OIL, RENEWABLE LIQUID TRANSPORTATION FUELS, PELLET BINDERS, GRAPHENE-BASED COMPOSITE MATERIALS, AND LIGNIN-BASED NANOPARTICLES. THESE NEW VALUE-ADDED WOOD PRODUCTS WILL EXPAND MARKETS, SUPPORT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND INCREASE PROFITABILITY FOR FOREST LANDOWNERS. FWRC RESEARCH PROGRAMS SUPPORT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AS AN ILLUSTRATION,  SOFTWARE AND METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED BY FWRC ARE USED BY THE MISSISSIPPI FORESTRY COMMISSION AND MISSISSIPPI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY TO INFORM SITING OF SAWMILLS AND PELLET PLANTS AND ATTRACT NEW INDUSTRIES TO THE STATE. THESE TOOLS DETERMINE THE IDEAL LOCATION TO BU ILD A FACILITY, BASED ON AVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO MARKETS AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS. EMERGING CARBON MARKETS PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MISSISSIPPI FOREST LANDOWNERS TO MONETIZE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES THAT PROVIDE A PUBLIC GOOD. FWRC SCIENTISTS ARE DEVELOPING DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS AND OUTREACH PRODUCTS TO HELP FOREST LANDOWNERS UNDERSTAND THESE MARKETS AND WEIGH THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF HARVEST DEFERRAL FOR CARBON CREDITS. EMERGING WILDLIFE DISEASES THREATEN WILDLIFE POPULATIONS, HUMAN HEALTH, AND ASSOCIATED RECREATION AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. MISSISSIPPI IS ON THE GEOGRAPHIC SOUTHEASTERN LEADING EDGE OF THE SPREADING CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE (CWD) EPIDEMIC. SCIENTISTS IN THE FOREST AND WILDLIFE RESEARCH CENTER HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE, FISHERIES AND PARKS, AND THE MSU COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE DIAGNOSTIC LAB SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO THIS NEW THREAT WITH SURVEILLANCE, DIAGNOSTICS, RESEARCH, AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT. DETECTION OF THIS EPIDEMIC WHILE GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITED AND AT LOW PREVALENCE, PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY A SCIENCE-BASED RESPONSE AND PROACTIVELY GET OUT IN FRONT WITH; DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES, REGULATORY POLICIES, HUNTER EDUCATION, AND HUMAN HEALTH GUIDELINES.

FOR THESE REASONS, SCIENTIFIC PROJECTS SUPPORTED THROUGH THE MCINTIRE-STENNIS PROGRAM AT THE COLLEGE OF FOREST RESOURCES AND ENVIRON MENTAL SCIENCE AT MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY HAVE SUPPORTED MULTIPLE SCIENTIFIC INITIATIVES. THIS DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF RESEARCH PROJECTS ADDRESSES MANY ASPECTS OF FORESTS INCLUDING SOILS, HYDROLOGY, TREE HEALTH INCLUDING PESTS AND PATHOGENS, PLANTS, FIRE, W ILDLIFE AND MORE. ONE SET OF PROJECTS HAS FOCUSED ON HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE TEMPERATE AND BOREAL GREAT LAKES REGION WILL INFLUENCE FOREST COMPOSITION, PEST POPULATIONS, DISEASE AND FOREST ADAPTATION. FUTURE FOREST AND WETLAND SYSTEMS CAN BE EXPECTED TO EXHIBIT  CHANGES, WHETHER DUE TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL-SCALE ALTERATIONS (E.G., CLIMATE CHANGE), OR TO MORE LOCAL AND REGIONAL IMPACTS FROM PEOPLE AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. OUR MCINTIRE-STENNIS PROJECTS HAVE FOCUSED ON THE SUSTAINABILITY AND RESILIENCE OF FUTURE FORESTS, EXAMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR DISTURBANCES (ANTHROPOGENIC OR OTHER) TO IMPACT BOTH GENERAL ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING OF FORESTS AND WETLANDS.

THE KSRE NETWORK INCLUDES OFFICES IN ALL 105 COUNTIES, ALONG WITH FOUR REGIONAL EXTENSION OFFICES, FIVE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENCOMPASS VARIABILITY IN CLIMATE AND SOILS, FOUR SATELLITE UNITS, FOUR AGRONOMY EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND FOUR HORTICULTURE CENTERS AND EXPERIMENT FIELDS. IN ADDITION, KSRE FUNDS RESEARCH PROJECTS IN 20 DEPARTMENTS ACROSS FIVE COLLEGES. A UNIQUE FEATURE WITHIN THE K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION ORGANIZATION IS THE CLOSE ALIGNMENT OF RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. IN 1996, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION WAS FORMED BY ALIGNING THE KANSAS AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (KAES) AND THE KANSAS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE. THE STRATEGIC INTENT OF THIS ALIGNMENT WAS TO ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCY AND SYNERGY BETWEEN DISCOVERY AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. ONE ANCILLARY BENEFIT OF THIS ALIGNMENT IS THAT BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH WILL LEAD TO RAPID EXTENSION PROGRAMMING AND APPLICATION IN THE FIELD. THIS ALIGNMENT ALSO ALLOWS MORE FLUID COMPLIANCE WITH MULTI-STATE AND INTEGRATED COMPONENTS OF AREERA. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSING ITS EFFORTS ON FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES (CRITICAL ISSUES) THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT ALL KANSANS: GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS, WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES, HEALTH, DEVELOPING TOMORROW'S LEADERS, AND COMMUNITY VITALITY. THESE GRAND CHALLENGES WERE DETERMINED THROUGH A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND DEFINE AREAS OF EMPHASIS FOR AGENTS, SPECIALISTS, AND RESEARCHERS. EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS AT THE LOCAL, REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL WORK TO DEVELOP REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE SIGNATURE PROGRAMS ALONG WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS MEMBERS THROUGH 11 PROGRAM FOCUS TEAMS - ADULT DEVELOPMENT AND AGING; COMMUNITY VITALITY; CROP PRODUCTION; FAMILY AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT; FAMILY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; FARM MANAGEMENT; HORTICULTURE; LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; NATURAL RESOURCES; NUTRITION, FOOD SAFETY AND HEALTH; AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, TWO TRANSDISCIPLINARY TEAMS WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS COMPLEX ISSUES TO KANSANS - LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS AND STRESS AND RESILIENCY. THE WORK OF THESE TEAMS FALLS WITHIN THE OVERALL UMBRELLA OF THE FIVE GRAND CHALLENGES. K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CANNOT SOLVE THESE CHALLENGES ALONE. KSRE'S STATEWIDE PRESENCE LENDS ITSELF TO COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH ORGANIZATIONS, PRIVATE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY, LOCAL GROUPS, STATE AND FEDERAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES. QUALITY FACULTY DRAW BUSINESSES AND FUNDING TO K-STATE AND TO KANSAS INCLUDING: - K-STATE IS THE ONLY UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD WITH ACCESS TO A FULL CONTINUUM OF BIOSECURITY LABORATORIES LOCATED ON OR ADJACENT TO CAMPUS. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE WILL PROVIDE PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSTICS, RESEARCH, SURVEILLANCE, AND TRAINING IN DISEASE VECTOR BIOLOGY. THE LABORATORIES WILL OFFER EMERGENCY RAPID TESTING AND MANUFACTURING TO PROTECT THE NATION'S ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SUPPLY DURING A CRISIS. - KANSAS PRIDE IS DEDICATED TO SERVING COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND VOLUNTEERS IN MAKING THEIR COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK. THE KANSAS PRIDE PROGRAM IS A PARTNERSHIP OF K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION, THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, KANSAS MASONS AND KANSAS PRIDE, INC. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, LOCAL COMMUNITIES IDENTIFY WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO PRESERVE, CREATE, OR IMPROVE FOR THEIR FUTURE. THEN, WORKING WITH THE RESOURCES OF K-STATE RESEARCH <(>&<)> EXTENSION AND THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS PULL TOGETHER TO CREATE THEIR IDEAL COMMUNITY FUTURE. - EXTENSION'S RESEARCH CENTERS, EXPERIMENT FIELDS AND HIGHLY SKILLED SCIENTISTS AND STAFF, COMBINED WITH THE CLIMATE AND SOIL VARIABILITY ACROSS THE STATE, PROVIDE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND CORPORATE AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. - FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES IS A PARTNER OF THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT FOR AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE EDUCATION TO MEDICARE ELIGIBLE KANSANS. APPROXIMATELY 1/3 OF THE CONTACTS OF THOSE SERVED ARE VULNERABLE BENEFICIARIES WITH INCOMES BELOW 150% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL. - KANSAS 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WAS AWARDED A CONTRACT BY THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR $4.2 MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE SUMMERS TO PROVIDE HANDS-ON, PROJECT-BASED 4-H SUMMER PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS COVID-19-RELATED LEARNING LOSS IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUILDING UPON THE LONG RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LEVERAGING THE STATE'S LARGEST YOUTH DEVELOPMENT NETWORK REACHING ALL 105 COUNTIES, KANSAS 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WILL USE SUMMER ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF YOUTH AS A PART OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN - ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF PLAN. - K-STATE - IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FOUR OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND SEVERAL INDUSTRY PARTNERS HAVE JOINED EFFORTS TO CREATE THE IRRIGATION I NNOVATION CONSORTIUM, A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH EFFORT TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF EFFICIENT IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES. - K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION WILL ADDRESS THE HEALTH OF KANSANS THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL COOPERATIVE EXTENSION'S FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH EQUITY AND WELL-BEING WHICH INCLUDES A FOCUS ON HEALTH EQUITY, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND COALITIONS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSETS. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF KANSAS CONTINUE TO CHANGE. KSRE IS REACHING OUT TO BOTH UNDERSERVED AND TRADITIONAL AUDIENCES THROUGH NEW VENUES. TO INCREASE MULTICULTURAL COMPETENCY AND SENSITIVITY AMONG OUR WORKFORCE, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION AND THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE/KSRE DIVERSITY PROGRAMS OFFICE PROVIDES REGULAR NAVIGATING DIFFERENCE TRAINING FOR NEW EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO BRING SYSTEMIC CHANGE AND DIVERSITY TO THE KSRE TEAM AND PROVIDE CULTURAL COMPETENCY AWARENESS AND SKILLS THAT THEY CAN PRACTICALLY APPLY IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY WORK. OTHER EFFORTS INCLUDE: - THE MULTICULTURAL UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM TARGETS UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS WITH THE GOAL TO ESTABLISH NETWORKING RELATIONSHIPS BACK TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOME INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS K-STATE FACULTY. THIS PROGRAM HAS A SPECIFIC GOAL OF GROWING THE MINORITY POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS WITHIN GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND ACROSS OTHER PARTNER COLLEGES REPRESENTED WITHIN K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION. - LOCAL UNIT EXTENSION COUNCIL MEMBERS REVIEW PARITY STATISTICS ANNUALLY AND SPEND TIME DETERMINING STRATEGIC EFFORTS NECESSARY TO REACH UNDERSERVED AND AT-RISK AUDIENCES. - K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN AND SECURING SERVICES THROUGH LANGUAGE LINE SERVICES TO BRING GREATER ACCESS TO LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT AUDIENCES. - THIS FALL, A NEW COMMUNITY LIAISON WILL BE ON STAFF TO HELP LINK KSRE'S RESOURCES TO THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN NORTHEAST KANSAS. GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEMS AS THE STATE'S LARGEST EMPLOYER, AGRICULTURE DRIVES THE KANSAS ECONOMY. IN 2020, THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTED $70.3 BILLION TO THE KANSAS ECONOMY. AGRICULTURE IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE, WITH 250,058 PEOPLE ACCOUNTING FOR 13 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE. WE ARE IMPROVING FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS TO FEED THE WORLD'S GROWING POPULATION, WHICH WILL ECONOMICALLY BENEFIT KANSAS. TO FEED AND SUSTAIN A GROWING POPULATION, K-STATE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION IS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRACTICES TO HELP FARMERS, RANCHERS, AND AGRIBUSINESSES IMPROVE PROFITABILITY, EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY FOR KANSAS, OUR NATION, AND THE WORLD THROUGH CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH IN AREAS SUCH AS GENETICS, DISEASE PREVENTION, FOOD SECURITY AND FARM BILL EDUCATION.

WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES WATER QUALITY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN KANSAS AND WATER QUANTITY IN WESTERN KANSAS ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES. CURRENT IRRIGATION TRENDS COULD DEPLETE 69 PERCENT OF THE GROUNDWATER IN THE OGALLALA AQUIFER WITHIN 50 YEARS, DRASTICALLY AFFECTING THE KANSAS ECONOMY. SEDIMENT AND SILT ARE WASHING INTO LARGE RESERVOIRS THAT SUPPLY DRINKING WATER AND RECREATION TO MANY KANSANS. TO ENSURE FUTURE GENERATIONS HAVE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF CLEAN WATER, OUR FOCUS WILL BE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO HELP KANSANS MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY. THESE INCLUDE PIONEERING NEW PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES; RESEARCHING HIGH-PRIORITY WATER ISSUES; FACILITATING MEETINGS AMONG LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATING RESEARCH RESULTS. PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS WOULD INCLUDE: O BREEDING NEW DROUGHT-TOLERANT CROP VARIETIES THAT CAN BE USED FOR HUMAN AND PET FOOD, LIVESTOCK FEED, AND FUEL. O IDENTIFYING BEST-ADAPTED TURF SPECIES AND CULTIVARS FOR KANSAS. O DEVELOPING MORE EFFICIENT IRRIGATION AND WATER MONITORING SYSTEMS FOR HOME AND FARM USE. O REDUCING RUNOFF AND SEDIMENTATION INTO RESERVOIRS. O IMPROVING LIVESTOCK GENETICS TO INCREASE FEEDING EFFICIENCY, WHICH REDUCES FEED AND WATER NEEDS. O WORKING WITH THE STATE OF KANSAS AND PARTNERING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES IDENTIFIED IN THE 50- YEAR VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF WATER PLAN. O BALANCING THE USE AND PROTECTION OF THE STATE'S NATURAL AND RECREATIONAL RESOURCES THAT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL, MEDICAL, E CONOMIC AND CULTURAL BENEFITS. HEALTH THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT OF KANSAS ADULTS ARE OBESE, AND 16.7 PERCENT OF KANSAS CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY.
