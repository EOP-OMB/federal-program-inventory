FURTHERMORE, MOREHOUSE RANKS AS ONE OF THE TOP UNDERGRADUATE PRODUCERS OF BLACKS WITH DOCTORAL AND MEDICAL DEGREES IN THE COUNTRY. IN ADDITION, THE COLLEGE CONFERS MORE BACCALAUREATE DEGREES UPON AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN THAN ANY OTHER INSTITUTION IN THE WORLD. OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES, MOREHOUSE COLLEGE HAS HAD THE VISION TO SUPPORT THE TRAINING OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO DIVERSIFY THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE.
