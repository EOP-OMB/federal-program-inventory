THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON A RIVERINE FOOD WEB THAT HAS BEEN INVADED BY A PREDATORY FISH SPECIES TARGETED BY ANGLERS FOR SPORT. AS THE PREDATORY FISH (FLATHEAD CATFISH) IS A FOOD FISH, AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE POTENTIAL HUMAN HEALTH RISK THROUGH CONSUMPTION IS REQUIRED. IN ADDITION, THIS INVASIVE FISH SPECIES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT HOW PFAS ACCUMULATE IN OTHER SPORT AND FOOD FISH. THEREFORE, UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF SPECIES INVASION ON PFAS ACCUMULATION IN OTHER POPULAR SPORTFISH IS IMPORTANT FOR INFORMING RISK ASSESSMENTS FOR FISH CONSUMPTION ADVISORIES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, KEY COMPARTMENTS OF THE FOOD WEB WILL BE SAMPLED AT RIVERINE SITES WITH AND WITHOUT THE INVASIVE FISH SPECIES PRESENT.

8/1/2022-12/31/2024CLIMATE CHANGE IS A KEY PROCESS INFLUENCING THE DISTRIBUTION AND SOCIETAL EFFECTS OF AQUATIC NUISANCE SPECIES, PARTICULARLY NONNATIVE FISHES. AS AQUATIC THERMAL REGIMES CHANGE WORLDWIDE, THERE ARE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR NONNATIVE FISH DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE WATER TEMPERATURE IS A \"MASTER VARIABLE\" AFFECTING FISH BIOENERGETICS, INDIVIDUAL GROWTH, AND POPULATION AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. AS SUCH, UNDERSTANDING WATER TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY (E.G., DAILY, SEASONAL, ANNUAL) AND THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON AQUATIC THERMAL REGIMES IS IMPORTANT FOR MANAGING NONNATIVE FISHES. HOWEVER, COORDINATED EFFORTS TO MONITOR AQUATIC THERMAL REGIMES ARE UNCOMMON AND SPATIALLY RESTRICTED IN THE SOUTHEAST COMPARED TO OTHER U.S. REGIONS. THE STATE OF FLORIDA HAS 431 NONNATIVE AQUATIC SPECIES AND MORE THAN 200 NONNATIVE FISHES, BUT AQUATIC THERMAL REGIMES REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD IN SEVERAL WAYS: (1) IN KEY WATER BODIES THAT ARE PRONE TO NONNATIVE FISH OCCURRENCE, PARTICULARLY FLORIDA RIVERS AND CANALS IN SOUTH FLORIDA; (2) AT SUFFICIENT SPATIOTEMPORAL AND ONTOGENETIC RESOLUTION FOR PREDICTING WHEN AND WHERE NONNATIVE FISHES ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR ACROSS THEIR LIFE HISTORY; AND (3) IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, PARTICULARLY SHIFTING AIR TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, AND GROUNDWATER REGIMES. TO ADDRESS THESE UNCERTAINTIES, WE ARE BUILDING A MULTIAGENCY TEAM TO MONITOR WATER TEMPERATURES AND THERMAL DYNAMICS AND MODEL NONNATIVE FISH SURVIVAL, REPRODUCTION, RECRUITMENT, AND DISPERSAL IN RIVERS, CANALS, AND SELECT LAKES ACROSS THE STATE OF FLORIDA UNDER DIFFERENT CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS IN 2022-2072. WILL MEASURE HOURLY WATER TEMPERATURES IN FLORIDA RIVERS AND CANALS IN 75 LOCATIONS OVER THE PROJECT DURATION.

WE WILL MAKE THESE PROJECTIONS UNDER DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, INCLUDING AIR TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, AND GROUNDWATER REGIMES. AS DESCRIBED FULLY IN OUR PREVIOUS PAPERS, WILL INTEGRATE MULTIPLE GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS INTO AIR TEMPERATURE WARMING INCREMENTS AND MODEL THE EFFECTS OF PRECIPITATION AND GROUNDWATER DYNAMICS ON WATER TEMPERATURE IN EACH WARMING SCENARIO. IN ADDITION, MODELS WILL EXPLICITLY ACCOUNT FOR EXPECTED INCREASES IN THERMAL SENSITIVITY.

THESE DOMAINS ARE 1) LONGITUDINAL (I.E., REPEATED OVER TIME) STUDIES OF ATTITUDES AND PERSPECTIVES OVER TIME IN AN AREA EXPERIENCING RECOLONIZATION; 2) MAPPING SOCIAL PHENOMENA TO COMPLEMENT ECOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF HABITAT SUITABILITY AND CONNECTIVITY; AND 3) INCLUDING ROBUST UNDERSTANDINGS OF ATTITUDES AND VALUES IN SCIENCE COMMUNICATION. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE METHODS CAN OFFER INSIGHTS AT LOCAL AND BROAD SCALES AND HELP IDENTIFY SYSTEMS UNDER STRESS AND PRIORITIZE MANAGEMENT. THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THIS FUNDING WILL TRAIN A GRADUATE STUDENT INVESTIGATOR IN THIS IMPORTANT BUT UNDERSTUDIED RESEARCH DOMAIN AND WILL DIRECTLY LEAD TO THE PRODUCTION OF A DISSERTATION CHAPTER.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED:THE RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE THREE FOCAL AREAS: 1) CONDUCTING LONGITUDINAL ASSESSMENTS ABOUT ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS TOWARD WOLVES OVER TIME, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE RECOLONIZATION HAS YET TO OCCUR BUT IS HIGHLY LIKELY; 2) MAPPING TOLERANCE OF WOLVES TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTAND OF HABITAT SUITABILITY, CONNECTIVITY, AND CONFLICT; AND 3) EXAMINING HOW TARGETED EDUCATION AND OUTREACH CAN EMPLOY UNDERSTANDING OF CONFLICTING AND SHARED VALUES TO SUPPORT MANAGEMENT.DELIVERABLES:THIS FUNDING WILL PRODUCE 2 PROGRESS REPORTS, A FINAL REPORT, AND 1-2 DISSERTATION CHAPTERSINTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES):THIS FUNDING WILL SUPPORT AN INCOMING PHD STUDENT RESEARCHER", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8a022699-f7be-356a-f01a-3aa6f76016ef-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_G22AC00348_1434"}, {"internal_id": 150045144, "Award ID": "G22AC00347", "Award Amount": 66037.74, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-07-06", "CFDA Number": "15.812", "Description": "PROJECT TITLE:SURVEY EVALUATING EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROCKFISH RECOVERY PLANPROJECT PERIOD: 6/15/22-9/30/23THREE SPECIES OF ROCKFISHES (SEBASTES SPP.) IN PUGET SOUND, WASHINGTON, WERE LISTED FOR PROTECTION UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IN 2010 (ONE HAS SINCE BEEN DELISTED). IN RESPONSE TO THIS LISTING, THE WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (WDFW) IMPLEMENTED A RETENTION BAN ON ALL ROCKFISH WITHIN THE REGION, LIMITED TARGETING OF ALL BOTTOMFISH TO 120 FEET DEEP, AND REQUIRED ANGLERS TO HAVE A DESCENDING DEVICE RIGGED AND READY WHEN TARGETING BOTTOMFISH. IN 2012, A SURVEY OF FISHERY PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED THAT MANY ANGLERS LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER THESE LISTED SPECIES WERE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY DISTINGUISH THEM FROM OTHER SPECIES COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED IN RECREATIONAL FISHERIES. THIS FINDING LED THE WDFW, NMFS, AND OTHER PARTNERS TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ON DIVERSE FORMS OF ANGLER OUTREACH TO INCREASE ROCKFISH IDENTIFICATION ABILITY AND FAMILIARITY WITH FISHING REGULATIONS FROM 2013-2021. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NEARLY A DECADE OF ROCKFISH-RELATED OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED -THIS PROJECT ENTAILS TWO PHASES.

HILL PHASE EIGHT AND IMPOUNDMENT MONITORINGPROJECT PERIOD: 07/01/2022-6/30/2023THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS AWARD IS TO FUND BAT MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS AT FORT A.P. HILL, VIRGINIA WITH EMPHASIS ON THE ENDANGERED INDIANA BAT (MYOTIS SODALIS) AND THREATENED NORTHERN LONG-EARED BAT (MYOTIS SEPTENTRIONALIS). AN ADDITIONAL COMPONENT OF ASSESSING THE HYDROLOGY OF INSTALLATION MILLPONDS AND WETLAND, IMPORTANT BAT FORAGING HABITAT AND ALSO HABITAT FOR THE ENDANGERED SWAMP PINK (HELONIAS BULLATA) IS INCLUDED. FORT A.P. HILL IS NOTABLE AS THE ONLY KNOWN LOCATION IN VIRGINIA WHERE A REPRODUCING MATERNITY COLONY OF THE INDIANA BAT OCCURS, AND IS ONE OF ONLY 2 KNOWN FOR THE MID-ATLANTIC EAST OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. LISTED AS ENDANGERED PRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF WHITE-NOSE SYNDROME, POPULATIONS OF INDIANA BATS HAVE DECREASE > 60% GENERALLY SINCE, AND > 90% IN THE MID-ATLANTIC. AS SUCH, FORT A.P. HILL IS NOW AN IMPORTANT CONSERVATION AREA FOR THE SPECIES. DATA COLLECTED FROM ACOUSTIC MONITORING AND RADIO-TAGGING CAUGHT BATS ARE IMPORTANT FOR DETERMINING FORAGING AND DAY-ROOSTING HABITAT REQUIREMENTS IN THESE MIXED PINE-HARDWOOD FORESTS THAT OCCUR ALONG THE FALL LINE. THESE DATA, IN TURN, CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEANINGFUL REGION-SPECIFIC SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS AND MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES THAT CAN INFORM MANAGEMENT THROUGHOUT. FOR EXAMPLE, AT FORT A.P. HILL, INDIANA BATS, APPEAR TO CHOOSE DECADENT LOBLOLLY PINE (PINUS TAEDA) STANDS WITH LOW FIRE-RETURN INTERVALS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO MILLPOND AND WETLAND HABITATS. THESE CONDITIONS CAN BE REPLICATED AND MAINTAINED ON A SHIFTING MOSAIC PATTERN THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE REGION THEREBY POTENTIALLY CONSERVING AND INCREASING EXTANT POPULATIONS - AN OUTCOME NECESSARY FOR SPECIES SURVIVAL. STILL, MANY FACETS OF THE SPECIES' BIOLOGY AND HABITAT USE REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD IN THIS REGION AND WILL REQUIRE CONTINUED MONITORING AND DATA COLLECTION. ALTHOUGH THE THREATENED NORTHERN LONG-EARED BAT HAS NOT YET BEEN OBSERVED EITHER ACOUSTICALLY OR VIA MIST-NET CAPTURE AT FORT A.P. HILL, OCCURRENCE OF THIS SPECIES IS KNOWN IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTH AT MARINE CORPS BASE-QUANTICO AND THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE PRINCE WILLIAM FOREST PARK AND TO THE SOUTH AT FORT PICKETT AND BIG WOODS WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA. DUE TO PAST CONCENTRATION OF WORK ON INDIANA BATS, MUCH OF THE INSTALLATION WHERE SUITABLE NORTHERN LONG-EARED BAT HABITAT OCCURS, I.E., CLOSED CANOPY, MATURE UPLAND HARDWOOD FORESTS, HAS NOT YET BEEN UNDERTAKEN. UNFORTUNATELY, PRESENCE OF THE INDIANA BAT ENTAILS CLOSE REGULATORY SCRUTINY FOR ACTIVITIES THAT MIGHT IMPACT THE SPECIES' NEEDED FOREST STRUCTURE CONDITION TO SUPPORT DAY-ROOSTS, I.E., FOREST HARVESTING, PRESCRIBED FIRE, AND IN THE CASE OF FORT A.P.

RAPID, NONINVASIVE SURVEYS WILL BE USED IN AN OCCUPANCY ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE HABITAT FEATURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BEE PRESENCE. INTENSIVE SURVEYS IN WHICH BEES ARE CAPTURED AND RELEASED WILL ALSO BE CONDUCTED AT A SUBSET OF SITES TO MEASURE A SUITE OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INDICATORS. THIS WORK WILL INFORM HABITAT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR THE PARTNERS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE PROGRAM AS WELL AS TARGETS FOR B.

HYDROLOGICALLY MANAGED TIDAL IMPOUNDMENTS IN THIS REGION ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT AQUATIC RESOURCES FOR MIGRATING AND WINTERING WATERFOWL IN THE ATLANTIC FLYWAY. HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES HAVE EXPOSED INFORMATION VOIDS REGARDING MTIS AND OTHER WETLAND TYPES IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC, SUCH AS ESTIMATES OF FORAGE AVAILABILITY FOR WATERFOWL. THE PURPOSE OF OUR STUDY IS TO OBTAIN WATERFOWL FOOD ABUNDANCE ESTIMATES AND EVALUATE ASSUMPTIONS FOR BIOENERGETICS MODELING IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC REGION USED IN CONSERVATION PLANNING BY THE ATLANTIC COAST JOINT VENTURE AND ITS PARTNERS TO MEET POPULATION-BASED HABITAT OBJECTIVES SET BY THE NORTH AMERICAN WATERFOWL MANAGEMENT PLAN. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL AID WATERFOWL CONSERVATION PLANNING AMID SEA LEVEL RISE ACROSS THE SOUTH ATLANTIC STATES (PRIMARILY NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND GEORGIA) AND PROVIDE A CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FOOD HABITS OF MOTTLED DUCKS AND OTHER WATERFOWL SPECIES USING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDS IN THE REGION.THE THREE OBJECTIVES OF OUR STUDY ARE TO 1) ESTIMATE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF FOOD ITEMS IN THE DIET IF DUCKS COLLECTED FROM WETLANDS COMMONLY USED BY WATERFOWL, 2) ESTIMATE ENERGY DENSITY OF WATERFOWL FORAGE IN COASTAL AND INLAND WETLANDS, AND 3) IMPROVE THE WETLANDS INVENTORY USED IN THE BIOENERGETICS MODEL CREATED BY THE ACJV AND PARTNERS BY LOCATING AND DIGITIZING PRIVATE IMPOUNDMENTS MANAGED FOR WATERFOWL IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC REGION. FOR INVESTIGATING WATERFOWL DIETS, WE WILL COLLECT FECES FROM HUNTER-HARVESTED DUCKS, THEN EXTRACT AND SEQUENCE DNA FROM THE FECES TO IDENTIFY PREY ITEMS CONSUMED. WILL ALSO LETHALLY COLLECT A SUBSET OF ACTIVELY FORAGING DUCKS TO EVALUATE DIFFERENCES IN DNA METHODOLOGIES AND TRADITIONAL DISSECTION TECHNIQUES. THE DIET DATA WILL ALSO IMPROVE ENERGETIC DENSITY ESTIMATES BY INFORMING US OF WHAT POTENTIAL FORAGE ITEMS ARE SELDOM CONSUMED BY WATERFOWL IN THE REGION AND THUS, CAN BE EXCLUDED FROM ESTIMATES. TO ESTIMATE ENERGETIC DENSITY OF FOCAL WETLANDS, WILL USE A VARIETY OF SAMPLING METHODS TO ESTIMATE BIOMASS OF FORAGE PRODUCED AND CONVERT BIOMASS TO ENERGETIC DENSITY (KCAL/HECTARE) USING PUBLISH TRUE METABOLIZABLE ENERGY VALUES. THE FOCAL WETLANDS IN WHICH PLAN TO SAMPLE INCLUDE THOSE MANAGED FOR SUBMERSED AQUATIC VEGETATION, MOIST-SOIL PLANT SPECIES, AND AGRICULTURAL CROPS, ALONG WITH UNMANAGED NATURAL MARSH. TO LOCATE AND DIGITIZE IMPOUNDMENTS, WILL USE REMOTELY SENSED DATA (E.G., LANDSAT AND LIDAR) AND MANUALLY DIGITIZE IMPOUNDMENTS IN ARCGIS. FROM DATA, WILL PROVIDE A SHAPEFILE OF ALL DIGITIZED MANAGED WATERFOWL IMPOUNDMENTS, WHICH WILL BE USED TO ESTIMATED ENERGETIC CARRYING CAPACITY ACROSS THE REGION. WILL ALSO PROVIDE ANALYSES OF WATERFOWL DIETS AND FORAGE PRODUCTION IN FOCAL WETLAND TYPES AND PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATING ELEMENTS FROM ALL THREE OBJECTIVES. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO THE ATLANTIC COAST JOINT VENTURE, THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, MULTIPLE SOUTHEASTERN STATE AGENCIES, AND ALL OTHER PARTNERS INTERESTED IN WATERFOWL AND WETLANDS CONSERVATION IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC.

WITH A FOCUS ON PRIMARY INTRODUCTION AND A REVIEW  OF SECONDARY SPREAD IN THE U.S. FROM TRANSPORTATION, THE ORGANISM IN TRADE PATHWAYS, AND  PERSPECTIVE OF NEW PATHWAYS. U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY WILL SHARE THE DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS WITH  THE BROADER FEDERAL AGENCY INVASIVE SPECIES GROUPS FOR COMMENT.  DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES:  NUMEROUS AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES PATHWAYS ARE MANAGED THROUGH VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE  AUTHORITIES. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW IS NEEDED TO EFFECTIVELY COORDINATE AND MANAGE THOSE  PATHWAYS AND PREVENT FUTURE INTRODUCTIONS THROUGH CURRENT GAPS IN PREVENTION. BY COMPARING THE  CURRENT STATE OF PREVENTION MEASURES WITH THE IDEAL STATE (NO NEW INTRODUCTIONS, ONLY LOW IMPACT  INTRODUCTIONS, ETC.), U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE AND OTHER MANAGEMENT AGENCIES CAN  DETERMINE WHAT THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE THIS  INFORMATION BY CRITICALLY REVIEWING CASE STUDIES OF FAILED PREVENTIONS OF AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES  AND CONDUCTING A GAP ANALYSIS.  THIS RESEARCH TEAM WILL ALSO PRODUCE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON THE AVAILABLE PREVENTION TOOLS  THAT WILL HIGHLIGHT THEIR USES AND THE RESEARCH TEAM'S ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. TIME,  MONEY, AND EFFORT CAN BE SAVED IF U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE UTILIZES OR ENHANCES CURRENTLY  AVAILABLE EFFECTIVE TOOLS AND PROJECTS RELATED TO PREVENTION. LASTLY, THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL LOOK TO  CREATE NEW PERFORMANCE METRICS RELATED TO THE PREVENTION GAP ANALYSIS RESULTS. THESE SUGGESTED  NEW METRICS WILL IMPROVE PREVENTION MANAGEMENT AND EFFECTIVENESS; BY PROVIDING MEASURABLE  OUTCOMES TO USE IN EVALUATING RESULTS.
