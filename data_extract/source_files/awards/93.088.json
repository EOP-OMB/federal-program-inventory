ALONG WITH PERVASIVE STIGMAS RELATED TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND LIMITED PROVIDER AWARENESS OF CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS, THIS DIAGNOSTIC STANDARD HAS CONTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANT DIAGNOSTIC DELAYS FOR THIS POPULATION. THERE IS AN ESTIMATED AVERAGE 7-12 YEAR GAP BETWEEN SYMPTOM ONSET AND APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSIS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS.  ALTHOUGH THE ABOVE DIAGNOSTIC DELAY IS WELL-DESCRIBED IN ENDOMETRIOSIS CARE, THERE IS LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAYS IN WHICH DIAGNOSTIC EXPERIENCES DIFFER ACROSS RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATIONS.

ENDOMETRIOSIS AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 10% OF WOMEN WORLDWIDE. THE CONDITION IS DEFINED BY THE PRESENCE OF ENDOMETRIAL-LIKE TISSUE OUTSIDE THE UTERINE CAVITY. IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERE PAIN AND INFERTILITY AND HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE. THE DELAY BETWEEN THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS OF ENDOMETRIOSIS IS TYPICALLY BETWEEN 6 AND 10 YEARS. WHILE ENDOMETRIOSIS IS NOT FATAL, WOMEN WITH UNDIAGNOSED ENDOMETRIOSIS MAY TURN TO ILLICIT OPIATES TO RELIEVE PAIN, PLACING THEM AT RISK FOR OVERDOSE. A STUDY OF COMMERCIAL CLAIMS DATA FROM 2009 TO 2018 OF 61,019 WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS FOUND THAT 37.9% HAD HIGH-RISK OR CHRONIC OPIATE USE CONDITIONS. THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE OF THE LINK BETWEEN CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN DUE TO UNADDRESSED ENDOMETRIOSIS AND THE TRANSITION FROM PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS TO ILLICIT OPIATE USE. WHILE ADVANCES IN LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGICAL IMAGING HAVE INCREASED THE ABILITY OF PHYSICIANS TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT ENDOMETRIOSIS, REFERRING ALL PATIENTS SUSPECTED OF HAVING ENDOMETRIOSIS TO LAPAROSCOPIC SURGEONS AND SPECIALIZED RADIOLOGISTS IS NOT FEASIBLE. RESEARCHERS HAVE DEVELOPED A PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRE TO DETECT PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS. HOWEVER, THE SCREENING TOOL HAS NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL TO ADDRESS DIAGNOSTIC DELAYS. GIVEN THE OPIATE OVERDOSE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, THERE IS A NEED TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK WOMEN WHO MAY BE USING ILLICIT OPIATES TO ALLEVIATE UNDIAGNOSED ENDOMETRIOSIS-RELATED PAIN. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL THAT INCLUDES A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY WOMEN IN EARLY RECOVERY FROM OPIATE USE DISORDERS AT RISK FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS, LINK THEM TO DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT, AND ULTIMATELY DECREASE ENDOMETRIOSIS-RELATED FATAL OVERDOSE. THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AN ENDOMETRIOSIS EDUCATION, SCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION, AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT (ENDO-SBIRT) INTERVENTION THAT WILL BE DELIVERED INDIVIDUALLY TO WOMEN OVER 15-20 MINUTES. ENDO-SBIRT WILL INCLUDE: 1) A 10-MINUTE EDUCATIONAL MODULE ON ENDOMETRIOSIS, 2) SCREENING FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS RISK USING THE CHAPRON PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRE, 3) DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF THE SCREENING DURING A BRIEF INTERVENTION, AND 4) REFERRAL OF WOMEN ASSESSED TO BE AT HIGH OR VERY HIGH RISK FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS TO A PROVIDER FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT. A TRAINED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER WILL DELIVER THE INTERVENTION UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN OB/GYN PHYSICIAN. A PARTNERSHIP WITH THREE SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT PROVIDERS WILL ENGAGE 225 WOMEN IN THE INTERVENTION OVER THREE YEARS.  THE GEOGRAPHIC CATCHMENT AREA WILL BE FIVE COUNTIES IN SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY WITH THE HIGHEST OVERDOSE RATES, INCLUDING ATLANTIC, CAMDEN, BURLINGTON, GLOUCESTER, AND OCEAN COUNTIES. THE POPULATION OF FOCUS WILL BE WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE WHO USE ILLICIT OPIATES TO RELIEVE THE PAIN OF UNDIAGNOSED ENDOMETRIOSIS. OUTCOMES THAT WILL BE MEASURED INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN ASSESSED TO BE AT HIGH RISK FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS, THE NUMBER OF WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH AND TREATED FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS, AND CHANGES IN ENDOMETRIOSIS KNOWLEDGE AND QUALITY OF LIFE.

HOWEVER, THERE IS AN EXTREMELY WIDE TREATMENT GAP FOR EDS, AND OVER 80% OF INDIVIDUALS WITH EDS DO NOT RECEIVE TREATMENT. EARLY INTERVENTION IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT DURING ADOLESCENCE, BECAUSE UNTREATED SYMPTOMS BECOME MORE FREQUENT, SEVERE, AND PERSISTENT OVER TIME, AND SHORTER LATENCY BETWEEN ED ONSET AND START OF TREATMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE MAJOR BARRIERS TO TREATMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH EDS, AND THERE IS CLEARLY A NEED FOR A NEW MODEL OF DELIVERY THAT CAN IDENTIFY AND HELP ADOLESCENTS WITH AND AT RISK FOR EDS. THE MISSOURI EDS COUNCIL (MO EDC), A PART OF THE MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH, WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2010 BY LAW. THE MO EDC HAS BEEN ADDRESSING THE LACK OF ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR EDS IN MISSOURI THROUGH TWO INITIATIVES: 1) THE BODY U PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES ED SCREENING AND A SUITE OF EVIDENCE-BASED DIGITAL PROGRAMS FOR EDS PREVENTION AND TREATMENT TO ADULTS; AND 2) THE 360 ED TRAINING PROGRAM, WHICH OFFERS FREE AND AFFORDABLE EDS TRAINING PROGRAMS TO HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR EDS FOR ADOLESCENTS IN MISSOURI BY HARNESSING STATE-WIDE PARTNERSHIPS AND TECHNOLOGY, USING A MODEL THAT COULD ULTIMATELY BE WIDELY IMPLEMENTED. IN LINE WITH THIS OVERALL OBJECTIVE, OUR SPECIFIC GOALS ARE TO: 1) DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR EDS; 2) CREATE PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS GAPS IN CARE; 3) CREATE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH; AND 4) PLAN FOR A TRANSITION OF A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT TO SUSTAINABILITY. TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS, WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE BODY U PROGRAM IN MISSOURI MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS. BODY U IS BASED ON DECADES OF RESEARCH AND IS  COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE EVIDENCE-BASED COMPONENTS, INCLUDING ONLINE EDS SCREENING; A DIGITAL SELF-HELP PROGRAM FOR ADOLESCENTS AT LOW RISK OF DEVELOPING AN ED; A DIGITAL SELF-HELP PROGRAM FOR ADOLESCENTS AT HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING AN ED; A COACHED DIGITAL PROGRAM FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH CLINICAL/SUBCLINICAL EDS OTHER THAN AN; AND REFERRALS TO PROVIDERS TRAINED BY THE MO EDC 360 PROGRAM FOR THOSE SCREENING POSITIVE FOR AN. THE DIGITAL PROGRAMS WILL ALSO ADDRESS THE SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS WHICH HAS INCREASED IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FOR MANY ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND CONTRIBUTED TO ED SYMPTOMS. THE ADOLESCENT VERSION OF OUR BODY U PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SCHOOLS AND PARENTS, WITH SCHOOL NURSES IN THE STATE SERVING AS CARE NAVIGATORS AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITY-CLINICAL LINKAGES.

THEY MAY BE INTRODUCED TO THE SUBSTANCE BY THEIR ABUSER. SUBSTANCE USE COERCION IS A TACTIC USED BY ABUSERS TO MAKE THE VICTIM DEPENDENT ON THE SUBSTANCE AND THUS, ON THE ABUSER. SURVIVORS MAY USE SUBSTANCES AS A COPING MECHANISM, ESPECIALLY IN THE FACE OF CONTINUAL TRAUMA AND HARM. SUBSTANCES ALLOW THE SURVIVOR TO NUMB THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM. THIS NUMBING ALSO HELPS THE SURVIVOR AVOID SEEKING MEDICAL CARE FOR PHYSICAL PAIN OR INJURY INFLICTED BY THE ABUSER, FOR WHICH THE SURVIVOR MAY BE TOO ASHAMED TO SEEK TREATMENT. FOR SOME SURVIVORS, USING SUBSTANCES WITH THE ABUSER IS AN ATTEMPT AT CONNECTION, WHICH THE SURVIVOR MAY HOPE PREVENTS THE ABUSER FROM INFLICTING MORE PAIN (ZAPATA-ALMA, 2020).

MDH HAS IMPLEMENTED THE EVIDENCE-BASED CUES (CONFIDENTIAL UNIVERSAL EDUCATION + EMPOWERMENT AND SUPPORT) INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION INTERVENTION WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS SINCE 2019, BUT MINNESOTA WOULD BENEFIT FROM AN EXPANSION OF THE CUES INTERVENTION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS TRAINED IN THIS INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATION BETTER, IMPROVE REFERRAL SYSTEMS, AND, ULTIMATELY, DECREASE VIOLENT DEATHS OF WOMEN.  THE GOALS OF THE MINNESOTA MATERNAL DEATH CONTEXT CUES PROJECT ARE TO REDUCE MATERNAL VIOLENT DEATH AND REDUCE DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL VIOLENT DEATH. MDH WILL ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS BY 1) ENHANCING MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, 2) EXPANDING THE CUES INTERVENTION, AND 3) EXTENSIVELY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES. ENHANCED MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS WILL INVOLVE LINKING DATA ACROSS SYSTEMS; DEVELOPING A DE-IDENTIFIED DATABASE OF MATERNAL DEATHS IN MINNESOTA; INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSIES IN ALL MATERNAL MORTALITY REVIEWS; AND DEVELOPING A VIOLENT DEATH REVIEW PROTOCOL. THE CUES INTERVENTION WILL BE EXPANDED IN FOUR WAYS TO IMPROVE THE REACH TO WOMEN MOST AT-RISK OF VIOLENT DEATH INCLUDING ADDING CONTENT ON SUICIDE PREVENTION; PROVIDING TRAININGS IN GREATER MINNESOTA AND TO NON-TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS SUCH AS FAMILY HOME VISITORS; PROVIDING TRAININGS IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH; AND DEVELOPING A CULTURALLY RELEVANT CUES MODEL FOR BLACK AND/OR AMERICAN INDIAN WOMEN. MDH HAS AN EXTENSIVE HISTORY OF LEADING INNOVATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND PREVENTION EFFORTS AND IS WELL-POSITIONED TO IMMEDIATELY ENACT PROJECT ACTIVITIES WITH AN ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION PARTNERS.  MDH WILL EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF PROPOSED ACTIVITIES ON MULTI-AGENCY COLLABORATION, LINKAGE OF DATA SYSTEMS, UNDERSTANDING OF RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS RELATED TO MATERNAL VIOLENT DEATH, AND DISSEMINATION OF LESSONS LEARNED. MDH WILL UTILIZE EXTENSIVE COMMUNICATIONS CONNECTIONS AND CAPACITY TO WIDELY DISSEMINATE PROJECT RESULTS AND LESSONS LEARNED TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES OF PREVENTION PARTNERS AND POLICYMAKERS. SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO ALL PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THAT MDH BUILDS ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY TO CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE BEST STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTING MATERNAL VIOLENT DEATH AFTER THE FUNDING PERIOD.  MDH HAS WELL-ESTABLISHED RESOURCES AND STRATEGIES TO INVESTIGATE MATERNAL MORTALITY THROUGHOUT THE AGENCY.

VIOLENCE IS A LEADING CAUSE OF MATERNAL MORTALITY, A PREVENTABLE FORM OF DEATH THAT CONTINUES TO RISE EACH YEAR IN LOUISIANA. FROM 2016 TO 2017, HOMICIDE WAS A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG ALL VERIFIED MATERNAL DEATHS IN LOUISIANA AT A RATE OF 12.9 DEATHS PER 100,000 LIVE BIRTHS. THIS WAS TWO-FOLD GREATER THAN ANY SINGLE OBSTETRIC CAUSE OF DEATH DURING PREGNANCY OR POSTPARTUM. RACIAL DISPARITIES EXIST AMONG DIFFERENT TYPES OF VIOLENT DEATH. SPECIFICALLY, BLACK PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN IN LOUISIANA WERE MORE THAN FIVE TIMES AS LIKELY TO DIE BY HOMICIDE THAN WHITE WOMEN IN THE SAME CATEGORY (40.8 PER 100,000 AMONG BLACK WOMEN; 7.6 PER 100,000 AMONG WHITE WOMEN).  WITH THIS PROPOSAL, BFH SEEKS TO REDUCE AND PREVENT MATERNAL DEATHS DUE TO VIOLENCE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING STRATEGIES: 1) IMPROVING THE IDENTIFICATION, TRACKING, AND REVIEW OF VIOLENT DEATHS IN PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN BY ESTABLISHING A DOMESTIC ABUSE FATALITY REVIEW PANEL; 2) IMPLEMENTING EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS TO INCREASE TIMELY ACCESS TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN; AND 3) ENHANCING LOUISIANA\u2019S CAPACITY TO SUSTAIN IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCE DEATHS OF PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN RESULTING FROM VIOLENCE. THROUGH BFH\u2019S SURVEILLANCE WORK AND MANAGEMENT OF OTHER FATALITY REVIEW COMMITTEES, BFH HAS ESTABLISHED PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS LOUISIANA INCLUDING OBSTETRICIANS, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS, VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION EXPERTS, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EXPERTS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO END MATERNAL DEATHS DUE TO VIOLENCE.
