THIS HAS PROMPTED RESEARCH TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF CERTAIN HERPES VIRUSES AS VACCINE VECTORS, FOCUSING PARTICULARLY ON DISEASES THAT REQUIRE CD8 T CELL RESPONSES FOR IMMUNITY. THE CAPACITY OF CD8 T CELLS TO ACT AS EFFECTORS AGAINST VIRAL INFECTIONS GENERALLY RELIES ON THEIR ABILITY TO RECOGNISE AND RESPOND TO VIRUS-INFECTED CELLS BEFORE THEY PRODUCE LARGE QUANTITIES OF VIRUS. IN THIS REGARD, CD8 T CELL RESPONSES TO HERPES VIRUSES SUCH AS HUMAN HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS (HSV-1) TEND TO INCLUDE DOMINANT RESPONSES AGAINST THE IE PROTEINS AND IT IS THESE RESPONSES THAT ARE PREDOMINANTLY INVOLVED IN MEDIATING IMMUNE PROTECTION. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF HERPES VIRUSES HAVE A PREFERENTIAL TROPISM FOR MACROPHAGES AND DENDRITIC CELLS, THUS ENABLING THE INFECTED CELLS THEMSELVES TOACT AS ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS FOR INDUCTION OF CD8 T CELL RESPONSES. ONE SUCH GROUP IS THE CYTOMEGALOVIRUSES (CMV), WHICH IN HUMANS CAUSE ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTIONS IN HEALTHY PEOPLE BUT CAN BE PATHOGENIC IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS. MOREOVER, SINCE CMVS ARE POOR INDUCERS OF NEUTRALISING ANTIBODIES, A CD8 T CELL RESPONSE CAN STILL BE INDUCED FOLLOWING IMMUNIZATION OF PREVIOUSLY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. THE COMBINATION OF THESE PROPERTIES MAKES CMVS AN ATTRACTIVE PROSPECT FOR USE AS VACCINE VECTORS. RECENT STUDIES UTILISING SIMIAN CMV AS A VECTOR FOR DELIVERY OF SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRAL ANTIGENS HAVE SHOWN THAT IT INDUCES STRONG VIRUS-SPECIFIC CD8 T CELL RESPONSES AND HIGH LEVELS OF PROTECTION AGAINST VIRUS CHALLENGE. ALTHOUGH A CYTOMEGALOVIRUS HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED IN CATTLE, BOVINE HERPES VIRUS 4 (BHV-4) SHARES A NUMBER OF PROPERTIES WITH CYTOMEGALOVIRUSES, WHICH HIGHLIGHT ITS POTENTIAL AS A VECTOR. ORIGINALLY CLASSIFIED AS A B-HERPES VIRUS AND REFERRED TO AS BOVINE CYTOMEGALOVIRUS, BASED ON ITS BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES, BHV-4 WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND TO BE A '-HERPES VIRUS. INFECTION WITH BHV-4 IS PREVALENT IN EUROPE AND USA AND ALTHOUGH THE VIRUS HAS BEEN ISOLATED FREQUENTLY FROM BOTH NORMAL AND DISEASED BOVINE TISSUES, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EVIDENCE THAT IT IS THE CAUSATIVE AGENT OF DISEASE. LIKE CYTOMEGALOVIRUSES, BHV-4 IS REPORTED TO HAVE A PREDILECTION FOR THE MACROPHAGE LINEAGE AND IT INDUCES POOR NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY RESPONSES. HENCE, IT IS LIKELY TO GENERATE CELLULAR IMMUNE RESPONSES IN PREVIOUSLY INFECTED ANIMALS AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE ADMINISTERED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION TO BOOST CELLULAR IMMUNE RESPONSES. BHV-4 HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS A VACCINE VECTOR BY DR. GAITANO DONOFRIA, WHO HAS PRODUCED SEVERAL RECOMBINANT BHV-4 VIRUSES EXPRESSING VIRAL PROTEINS AND SHOWN THAT THEY STIMULATE STRONG ANTIBODY RESPONSES IN CALVES AND PROTECTION AGAINST THE RESPECTIVE VIRUSES.
