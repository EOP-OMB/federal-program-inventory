CURRENTLY, RECOVERY OF AMPLIFIABLE DNA FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IS LIMITED FOR PROCESSED SOURCE MATERIALS, LIKELY DUE TO THE EXTREME CHEMICAL CONDITIONS INVOLVED IN FUR MANUFACTURING. MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF HAIR SHAFTS IS LIMITED BY THE RESTRICTED NUMBER OF TRAINED PRACTITIONERS, SOMETIMES POOR SPECIES RESOLUTION, AND CONTROVERSIAL NATURE OF MICROSCOPIC COMPARISONS.

THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE NATIONAL SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS FOR THE NEEDS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. FORENSIC PATHOLOGY IS ESSENTIAL FOR INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF CRIMINAL DEATHS, PROTECTION OF THOSE WRONGFULLY ACCUSED, SURVEILLANCE OF HAZARDS AND THREATS TO THE COMMUNITY, AND TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHEN SOMEONE IS KILLED OR DIES SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY. THE MEDICAL SPECIALTY OF FORENSIC PATHOLOGY REQUIRES, AT A MINIMUM, FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL, THREE TO FOUR YEARS OF PATHOLOGY RESIDENCY, AND ONE YEAR OF FORENSIC PATHOLOGY FELLOWSHIP TRAINING. REQUIRING 16 TO 17 YEARS OF ADVANCED EDUCATION, VERY FEW INDIVIDUALS MEET QUALIFICATIONS TO PRACTICE FORENSIC PATHOLOGY. FURTHERMORE, BURDENED WITH YEARS OF ACCUMULATED EDUCATIONAL DEBT, ONLY HIGHLY DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE FORENSIC PATHOLOGY WITH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES LIMITED TO COUNTY GOVERNMENT POSITIONS HAVING SALARIES LESS THAN SIMILARLY TRAINED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. \n\nFOR MANY REASONS, STRENGTHENING THE MEDICAL EXAMINER \u2013 CORONER SYSTEM DEMANDS AN EMPHASIS ON ATTRACTING CANDIDATES AND EDUCATING THEM IN FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS.
