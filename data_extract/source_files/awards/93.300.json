DESPITE A COMPELLING NATIONAL NEED FOR TREATMENT, THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WAS NEITHER TRAINED TO CARE FOR NOR ESPECIALLY EAGER TO ACCEPT PATIENTS WITH SUD.4    HOWEVER, THE PAST DECADE HAS SEEN AN INCREASING AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SUBSTANCE USE EDUCATION FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS, RESIDENTS, AND PRACTICING PHYSICIANS WITH GREATER EMPHASIS ON SUD TRAINING CORRESPONDING TO A WIDER PERCEPTION OF SUDS AS CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS. THIS EVOLUTION HAS LED IN PART TO AN EXPANSION IN FORMAL SUD TRAINING.5 FOR EXAMPLE, FACULTY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR OF THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY IN 2020 INITIATED AN ACGME APPROVED FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAM IN ADDICTION PSYCHIATRY WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT EXPANSION OF THE ADDICTION PSYCHIATRY WORKFORCE WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED PREVENTION SERVICES, REDUCE THE PREVALENCE OF SUD, AND INCREASE ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT AND RECOVERY SERVICES.

THIS CONTACT ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE TO ALUMNI ABOUT DELIVERING MAT SERVICES TO FELLOW KENTUCKIANS.  THEN, AT THEIR SECOND ANNIVERSARY, WE WILL DISTRIBUTE A VOLUNTARY SURVEY TO CAPTURE HOW MANY ALUMNI PRESCRIBE MAT AND AN APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAT ARE BEING REACHED BY THESE INITIATIVES.  WE WILL FOLLOW SIMILAR METHODS TO EXPAND MAT WAIVER TRAINING TO OUR FACULTY, OTHER ALUMNI, AND MAT TRAINERS TO REACH OVER 168 PROFESSIONALS AND PRE-PROFESSIONALS.

THIS OPIOID CRISIS WAS MADE WORSE BY THE ADDITION OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS EVIDENCED BY THE INCREASE IN OPIOID OVERDOSE DEATHS OVER THE PAST YEAR SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC.  OPIOID USE DISORDER IS A CHRONIC MEDICAL/PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY TREATED WITH COGNITIVE, BEHAVIORAL, AND MEDICATION-ASSISTED MODALITIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PROVIDERS OF ADDICTION PREVENTION AND TREATMENT IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA OR ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. RURAL AREAS AND OTHER LOCATIONS WITH DISPARATE POPULATIONS HAVE AN EVEN GREATER CHALLENGE TOWARD RECEIVING PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES AS THERE ARE EVEN FEWER PROVIDERS OF THESE SERVICES IN THOSE AREAS THAN URBAN AND AFFLUENT AREAS.  NURSE PRACTITIONERS CAN PROVIDE ADDICTION TREATMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT, SPECIFICALLY BUPRENORPHINE FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER. HOWEVER, THERE ARE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT NURSE PRACTITIONERS FROM TREATING OPIOID USE DISORDER. FIRST, NURSE PRACTITIONERS MUST COMPLETE 24 HOURS OF SPECIFIC TRAINING IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A WAIVER TO PRESCRIBE BUPRENORPHINE.
