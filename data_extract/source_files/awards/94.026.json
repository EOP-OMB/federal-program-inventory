THE CCH TEAM, COMPRISED OF TWO PEER WORKERS, A PROGRAM SUPERVISOR AND ADMINISTRATOR, WILL SERVE AS CO-RESEARCHERS WITH THE PROJECT DIRECTOR AND WILL BE ACTIVE PARTNERS IN STUDY DESIGN, DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION AND DISSEMINATION. TOGETHER THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL CONDUCT THREE PHOTOVOICE PROJECTS (ENGAGING 24 YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS), CONDUCT INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS WITH MUTUAL AID TEAM MEMBERS, AND COLLECT STRUCTURED WEEKLY JOURNAL ENTRIES TO BUILD DEEP INSIGHT AROUND 3 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:\n\n1.\tTO UNDERSTAND HOW YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS  PERCEIVE MUTUAL AID PROVIDED BY PEER WORKERS.\n2.\tTO UNDERSTAND HOW PEER WORKERS EXPERIENCE THEIR ROLE, INCLUDING THE PERSONAL BENEFITS, CHALLENGES AND NEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING MUTUAL AID. \n3.\tTO UNDERSTAND HOW YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS CONCEPTUALIZE SOCIAL CAPITAL AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT.\n\nUTILIZING A GROUNDED THEORY APPROACH TO ANALYSIS, THE TEAM WILL CREATE AN EMPIRICALLY-DRIVEN, YOUTH-INFORMED MODEL OF MUTUAL AID FOR YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS, INCLUDING STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITING, SELECTING, TRAINING, SUPPORTING, AND SUPERVISING PEER WORKERS AS AGENTS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT.

THE RESEARCH QUESTION WAS SIMPLE: DO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MAXIMIZE THE EXPERIENCE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF THEIR VOLUNTEERS?  WE LEARNED THAT ORGANIZATIONS VARY IN THEIR CAPACITY TO EFFECTIVELY RECRUIT AND RETAIN THEIR VOLUNTEERS. \n    \"VMC I\" IS STILL THE ONLY NATIONAL (U.S.) STUDY OF VOLUNTEER ADMINISTRATION, AND PRACTITIONERS, TEACHERS, AND RESEARCHERS ROUTINELY POINT TO IT.  HOWEVER, THE WORLD HAS CHANGED IN KEY WAYS OVER THE PAST 14 YEARS. HOWEVER, WE STILL REGULARLY HEAR STORIES OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND BOARDS WHO CHOOSE NOT TO INVEST IN THEIR VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS, DESPITE VOLUNTEER ADMINISTRATORS WHO POINT TO OUR 2004 ADMONITIONS THAT VOLUNTEER MANAGEMENT CAPACITY BREEDS HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE VOLUNTEERS. OUR JOB IS NOT DONE.\n    WE PROPOSE AN UPDATE TO THE 2003 STUDY. WE WILL RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL NONPROFIT SAMPLE TO SEE HOW VOLUNTEER MANAGEMENT CAPACITY HAS EVOLVED IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS OVER TIME.  WE WILL SUPPLEMENT THAT SAMPLE WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUNDED IN THE LAST 14 YEARS, AND WEIGHT THE POOLED SAMPLES TO GAIN A CURRENT PICTURE OF THE STATE OF VOLUNTEER MANAGEMENT CAPACITY IN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. A WEB SURVEY WILL PROVIDE THE CORE DATA. AS IN THE FIRST STUDY, THE FOCUS WILL BE ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH EFFECTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT.
