THE GOAL OF THE NC PUMPOUT PROGRAM OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS HAS BEEN TO MAKE PUMPOUT AND DUMP STATIONS READILY AVAILABLE AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CONVENIENT FOR RECREATIONAL BOATERS AND MARINA OPERATORS. THE DIVISION OF COASTAL MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO MAKING PUMPOUT FACILITIES AS COMMON AS OTHER SERVICES, SUCH AS FUEL. SINCE THE PROGRAMS INCEPTION, THE PROPER DISPOSAL OF BOAT SEWAGE IN NC HAS BEEN A  CATCH 22.  RECREATIONAL BOATERS CLAIM THEY ARE FORCED TO TRAVEL BEYOND THE THREE-MILE TERRITORIAL LIMIT TO DISCHARGE THEIR WASTE, OR DISCHARGE ILLEGALLY IN THE SOUNDS BECAUSE PUMPOUT FACILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE. MARINA OPERATORS QUESTION THE NEED FOR INSTALLING PUMPOUT STATIONS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF DEMAND BY RECREATIONAL BOATERS. SINCE 1995, THE NC PUMPOUT PROGRAM HAS AWARDED 128 GRANTS FOR THE INSTALLATION OF 114 PUMPOUT FACILITIES BRINGING THE TOTAL AVAILABLE IN THE COASTAL AREA TO 132. THE NC PUMPOUT PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PUMPOUTS IN AREAS IDENTIFIED AS LACKING THESE FACILITIES WITH THE INSTALLATION OF 5 ADDITIONAL PUMPOUT STATIONS DURING 2020-2023. DUE TO STATE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS, THE NC PUMPOUT PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON MATCHING FUNDS FROM PARTICIPATING MARINAS. THE NC DIVISION OF COASTAL MANAGEMENT WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THE NC CLEAN MARINA PROGRAM AND THE NC CLEAN BOATER PROGRAM TO PROMOTE THE USE OF PUMPOUT FACILITIES AND INCREASE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MARINE SEWAGE ON THE ENVIRONMENT. FROM THE START OF THE GRANT PROGRAM, THE MAJOR FOCUS HAS BEEN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PUMPOUT AND DUMP STATIONS IN THE ALBEMARLE-PAMLICO ESTUARINE SYSTEM. ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF THE GRANT PROGRAM HAS BEEN THAT OF THE 114 PUMPOUT STATIONS INSTALLED BY THE PUMPOUT PROGRAM, 56 ARE IN THE ALBEMARLE-PAMLICO REGION. IN 2010 HOWEVER, THE NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES (DENR), DIVISION OF WATER QUALITY (DWQ), REQUESTED AND RECEIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) DESIGNATION OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COASTAL WATERS, EXTENDING THREE NAUTICAL MILES (NM) INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF BRUNSWICK, PENDER AND NEW HANOVER COUNTIES, INCLUDING FUTCH CREEK, PAGES CREEK, BRADLEY CREEK, HEWLETTS CREEK, HOWE CREEK, WHISKEY CREEK, SNOWS CUT, AS WELL AS UNNAMED TRIBUTARIES AND ALL UNNAMED TIDAL CREEKS TO THESE WATERS AS A NO DISCHARGE ZONE (NDZ) PURSUANT TO THE CLEAN WATER ACT, SECTION 312(F)(3). WHILE THERE ARE 23 MARINAS WITH PUMPOUT FACILITIES WITHIN THE NO DISCHARGE ZONES, THE DESIGNATION DOES CONSIDER PUMPOUT FACILITIES OUTSIDE THE ZONE TO ASSURE AN ADEQUATE BOATER TO PUMPOUT RATIO. DURING THE 2009 LEGISLATIVE SESSION, THE NC GENERAL ASSEMBLY PASSED THE CLEAN COASTAL WATER AND VESSEL ACT (SL 2009-345 H 1378 RATIFIED WITH AMENDMENTS JULY 2010). THIS ACT ADDRESSES THE DISCHARGE OF SEWAGE FROM VESSELS INTO CERTAIN COASTAL WATERS AND REQUIRES MARINAS WITH A SPECIFIED SLIP CAPACITY TO INSTALL AND MAINTAIN PUMPOUT FACILITIES. WHILE THE NC PUMPOUT PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ALBEMARLE-PAMLICO REGION, THE INSTALLATION OF PUMPOUT FACILITIES IN NO DISCHARGE ZONES WILL ALSO BE A PRIMARY FOCUS.
