SOME THREATS SUCH AS HABITAT LOSS AND HUMAN DISTURBANCE ARE MORE IMMEDIATE WHEREAS THE IMPACTS OF SEA-LEVEL RISE MAY BE FURTHER OFF IN TIME BUT REQUIRE PLANNING NOW. HUMAN DISTURBANCE AND SEA-LEVEL RISE ARE BOTH IDENTIFIED AS THREATS OF HIGH OR VERY HIGH CONCERN IN THE PACIFIC AMERICAS SHOREBIRD CONSERVATION STRATEGY AND REQUIRE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES TO REDUCE AND/OR ADAPT TO THESE THREATS. IN RECENT WORK, THE 13-COUNTRY MIGRATORY SHOREBIRD PROJECT (MSP) HAS COLLECTED DATA TO DOCUMENT THE MAGNITUDE AND RELATIVE DEGREE OF EXPOSURE OF IMPORTANT SITES FROM MEXICO TO CHILE TO HUMAN DISTURBANCE AND SEA-LEVEL RISE. THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THAT WORK TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THESE THREATS MORE FULLY AND MORE SO TO IDENTIFY WHAT CONSERVATION STRATEGIES CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TO MITIGATE THE THREATS. WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF NATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THESE TWO THREATS. TO DO THIS WE WILL USE EXISTING DATA AND THE MSP PARTNER NETWORK TO 1) QUANTIFY THE IMPACTS OF DISTURBANCE ACROSS 84 SITES FROM MEXICO TO CHILE AND WORK WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AT SITES WITH HIGH RATES OF DISTURBANCE TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE DISTURBANCE AND 2) ASSESS THE CAPACITY OF WESTERN HEMISPHERE SHOREBIRD RESERVE NETWORK (WHSRN) SITES ON THE PACIFIC COAST OF THE AMERICAS TO ADAPT TO SEA-LEVEL RISE AND WORK WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY THE PATHWAYS (E.G., POLICY, ZONING) TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING ADAPTATION STRATEGIES. THE PROJECT WILL REACH OUT TO THE RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH WEBINAR/WORKSHOPS ABOUT OUR FINDINGS TO DETERMINE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS AND WHETHER CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT CAN BE MADE. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE WILL WORK WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO IMPLEMENT DISTURBANCE MITIGATION MEASURES. WE WILL QUANTIFY THE ADAPTIVE CAPACITY OF WHSRN SITES SHOWN TO HAVE HIGH POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO SEA-LEVEL RISE.

FOR THAT REASON, SHOREBIRDS AND THEIR HABITAT ARE EXPOSED TO THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS CAUSED BY, FOR EXAMPLE, TOURISM DEVELOPMENT, RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, WATER CONTROL AND IRRIGATION WORKS COMBINED WITH THE CONTINUOUS PRESSURE AND POLLUTION CAUSED BY AGRICULTURE, FISHING, AND AQUACULTURE. ALL OF THESE THREATS HAVE CAUSED THE LOSS AND DEGRADATION OF SOME OF THE REGIONS WETLANDS, A PROBLEM THAT IS MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE COASTAL LAGOONS ALONG THE CONTINENTAL COASTLINE BECAUSE OF EXPANSIVE AND INTENSE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THAT REGION.THE OUTCOME OF OUR ACTIONS IN THIS PROJECT IS TO PROTECT PRIORITY SHOREBIRD HABITAT.TO DO SO, WE REGULARLY MONITOR SHOREBIRD POPULATIONS AND THEIR HABITATS IN NORTHWEST MEXICO AS A TOOL TO EVALUATE AND ADAPT WETLAND CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACTIONS, AND COLLABORATE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SITE-SPECIFIC CONSERVATION OR RESTORATION INITIATIVES.

THE AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHER IS A FOCAL SPECIES OF THE PACIFIC AMERICAS SHOREBIRD CONSERVATION STRATEGY AND IS LISTED AS ENDANGERED BY THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. THE COASTS OF SINALOA, AND THE ASSOCIATED BARRIER ISLANDS IN PARTICULAR, REPRESENT THE MOST IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THIS SUBSPECIES. CRITICAL THREATS TO THE AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHER WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY MONITORING SURVIVAL, HABITAT USE, AND BREEDING SUCCESS, AND SPECIFIC SITES WILL BE FLAGGED AS PRIORITY AREAS FOR FUTURE CONSERVATION ACTIONS. THE AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHER IS AN UMBRELLA SPECIES IN THE REGION, AND THIS PROJECT WILL POSITIVELY AFFECT MANY SPECIES THAT SHARE HABITAT WITH THIS IMPORTANT SUBSPECIES. FOCUSING CONSERVATION EFFORTS ON THE AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHER WILL PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR MULTIPLE PROBLEMS THAT ARE SHARED AMONG THE OTHER 12 SPECIES OF BIRDS THAT BREED IN THE COASTAL DUNE HABITATS OF THE REGION. HUMAN ACTIVITIES HAVE GENERATED CHANGES IN COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS THAT HAVE ALLOWED NEW THREATS, SUCH AS PREDATOR INTRUSIONS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF DISTURBANCE, TO APPEAR IN HIGHLY VULNERABLE SITES INHABITED BY AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHERS. THESE THREATS AFFECT BREEDING SUCCESS AND PUT INDIVIDUAL SURVIVAL AND POPULATION VIABILITY AT RISK IN THE LONG TERM. FORTUNATELY, THESE THREATS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES CAN BE PREVENTED, MINIMIZED, OR EVEN REVERSED THROUGH SURVEILLANCE AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. TO THIS END, WE PROPOSE ACTIONS THAT INCLUDE MONITORING AND BANDING AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHERS IN THREE IMPORTANT COASTAL LAGOONS OF SINALOA TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, USE OF WINTER HABITAT, AND LOCAL SURVIVAL. THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP TO DETERMINE THE POPULATION STATUS OF AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHERS DURING THEIR ANNUAL CYCLE, WHILE PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MANAGEMENT ACTIONS.
