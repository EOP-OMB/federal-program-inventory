BATTERY-ELECTRIC ZERO-EMISSION 60-FT ARTICULATED BUSES AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT TO SERVE THE MBTAS SILVER LINE. FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE (DATED 4/6/15) AND ORIGINAL PROGRAM APPLICATION ARE ATTACHED.THE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE MORE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF RELIABLE GREEN ENERGY BUSES INTO TRANSIT FLEETS. THE DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO-EMISSION BATTERY-ELECTRIC BUSES AT MBTA WILL BE A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE TRANSIT OPERATIONS THAT IS REPLICABLE TO TRANSIT AGENCIES NATIONWIDE. NOT ONLY WILL THE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PETROLEUM FUEL CONSUMPTION AND GHG EMISSIONS BUT THESE BUSES WILL CREATE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OPERATING COSTS.; ACTIVITIES PERFORMED: SCOPE:TO ACCOMPLISH THIS DEPLOYMENT THE MBTA WILL PARTNER WITH NEW FLYER AND THE CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT (CTE) BOTH RECOGNIZED AS LEADERS IN CLEAN TRANSIT DEPLOYMENTS. NEW FLYER IS THE LARGEST TRANSIT BUS OEM IN THE US AND CTE HAS UNPARALLELED EXPERIENCE IN EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND IMPLEMENTING ZERO-EMISSION BUS DEPLOYMENT PROGRAMS.WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MBTAS DUAL MODE FLEET OF 32 BUSES CURRENTLY ALL 60 LOW FLOOR ARTICULATED BUSES IN SERVICE TODAY IN NORTH AMERICA UTILIZE THE REAR AXLE TO PROVIDE PROPULSION POWER BY PUSHING THE BUS. DURING WINTER MONTHS WHEN SNOW AND ICE ARE PRESENT ON THE ROADWAY REAR AXLE PROPULSION RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT TRACTION ISSUES CAUSING THE BUS TO JACK KNIFE. SUBSEQUENTLY THE MBTA PROVIDES 40 BUSES TO REPLACE 60 BUSES ON SURFACE ROUTES NORMALLY OPERATED BY 60 BUSES WITH REAR AXLE PROPULSION WHENEVER SNOW OR EXTREME ICE CONDITIONS ARE FORECASTED. MBTA ROUTES OPERATE THROUGH RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE NOISE FROM THE DIESEL OR CNG ENGINE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE.AS A SOLUTION THE MBTA IS PROPOSING TO REPLACE FIVE (5) 60 BUSES FOR SILVER LINE SERVICE WITH NEW FLYERS XE60 FULLY BATTERY-ELECTRIC BUS WHICH INCLUDES A SECOND POWERED DRIVE AXLE TO ENHANCE SAFE OPERATION DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF A 450 KW RAPID CHARGING STATION IN THE UNDERGROUND SILVER LINE TUNNEL AT THE SOUTH STATION TERMINAL TO FAST-CHARGE THE BUSES DURING SCHEDULED LAYOVERS. ; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE WINTERTIME OPERATION SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER ENERGY AND MAINTENANCE COSTS REDUCED MBTA DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS ZERO TAILPIPE EMISSIONS IN INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGH RATES OF ASTHMA AND RESPIRATORY AILMENTS AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AND SENIOR CITIZENS REDUCED NOISE POLLUTION IN SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS BETTER VEHICLE PERFORMANCE AND PROPULSION SYSTEM DURABILITY INCREASED COMFORT FOR THE OPERATOR AND PASSENGERS; INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: BUS RIDERS; SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: NONE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3c326c64-8c0a-e5b2-d2fc-f86d35b41baf-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_MA-26-0064_6955"}, {"internal_id": 149790445, "Award ID": "MA-26-0063", "Award Amount": 0.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-06-27", "CFDA Number": "20.514", "Description": "BUDGET REVISION 7/2020:THE $223265 IN UNEXPENDED FUNDING WILL BE APPLIED TO COMMUNICATIONS OUTREACH AND MEDIA STRATEGY FOR THE FAIRMOUNT/INDIGO COMMUTER RAIL PILOT SINCE THE PROJECT ORIGINALLY PROPOSED UNDER THIS GRANT IS NO LONGER BEING ADVANCED.ORIGINAL GRANT:THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY (MBTA) IS REQUESTING $352500 IN FLEXED FHWA TCSP FUNDING FOR PLANNING AND ENHANCEMENTS ON THE FAIRMOUNT CORRIDOR. FHWA OPERATING BUDGET TRANSFER DOCUMENT DATED 3/11/2013 IS ATTACHED. BACKGROUNDTHE FAIRMOUNT CORRIDOR COMMUTER RAIL LINE OPERATED BY THE MBTA CURRENTLY RUNS FROM SOUTH STATION SOUTH THROUGH THE BOSTON NEIGHBORHOODS OF DORCHESTER ROXBURY MATTAPAN AND TERMINATES IN THE READVILLE SECTION OF HYDE PARK. IT CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY 9.2 MILES OF TRACK SEVEN STATIONS (INCLUDING THE THREE NEWEST ONES) AND FORTY-ONE BRIDGES. IT IS THE ONLY COMMUTER RAIL BRANCH THAT EXCLUSIVELY SERVES THE CITY OF BOSTON AND MBTA#8242;S URBAN CORE. IN OCTOBER OF 2002 THE MBTA PERFORMED A FEASIBILITY STUDY (ATTACHED IN TEAM) TO IDENTIFY INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES NEEDED TO MAINTAIN A STATE OF GOOD REPAIR ON THE FAIRMOUNT LINE. THE IDENTIFIED UPGRADES INCLUDED REHABILITATING EXISTING STATIONS RECONSTRUCTING SEVERAL BRIDGES CONSTRUCTING A NEW TRACK INTERLOCKING SWITCHING SYSTEM UPGRADING THE EXISTING SIGNAL SYSTEM AND DE-LEADING PAINTING AND MINOR REPAIR WORK TO OTHER BRIDGES.THE FEASIBILITY STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIED CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE RIDERSHIP AND REVENUES AND POTENTIALLY ALLEVIATE THE ISSUE OF OVERCROWDED BUSES ALONG THE FAIRMOUNT CORRIDOR. ONE OF THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDED CONSTRUCTING THREE NEW COMMUTER RAIL STATIONS THAT WOULD PROVIDE A HIGHER QUALITY LEVEL OF BUS SERVICE AND AN ALTERNATIVE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION IN WALK-TO STATIONS FOR NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS ALONG THE CORRIDOR. SINCE THE STUDY WAS RELEASED THE MBTA HAS EMBARKED UPON SEVERAL OF THE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS INCLUDING CONSTRUCTING THREE NEW STATIONS (FOUR CORNERS/GENEVA TALBOT AVENUE AND NEWMARKET) ALONG THE RAIL CORRIDOR. THESE STATIONS OFFICIALLY OPENED FOR SERVICE IN SUMMER 2013. A FOURTH NEW STATION AT MATTAPAN IS IN DESIGN AND IS PLANNED FOR CONSTRUCTION IN 2014-15. IN ADDITION THE MBTA HAS MODERNIZED THE ALREADY-EXISTING STATIONS RECONSTRUCTED SEVEN RAIL BRIDGES AND UPGRADED TRACK AND SIGNAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS CAPITAL INVESTMENT WAS TO OPEN UP PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE LINE FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING PREVIOUSLY UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS AND TO EXPAND TRAVEL OPTIONS FOR FAIRMOUNT CORRIDOR RESIDENTS AND WORKERS MANY OF WHOM ARE LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME MINORITIES. THE MBTA IS NEARING COMPLETION OF ITS 10-YEAR $200 MILLION TRANSIT CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO UPGRADE THE LINE. CURRENTLY MANY RESIDENTS BELIEVE THAT THE FAIRMOUNT/INDIGO LINE DOES NOT EXIST TO PROVIDE LOCAL SERVICE FOR THEM BUT THAT IT IS FOR COMMUTERS FROM OUTSIDE THE CITY. FOR DECADES THERE WERE FEW STOPS ON THE LINE AND THE EXISTING STATIONS HAD FALLEN INTO SIGNIFICANT DISREPAIR. IN ADDITION THE MBTAS RAPID TRANSIT/SUBWAY/LIGHT RAIL LINES LIKE THE RED LINE AND BLUE LINE DO NOT DIRECTLY SERVE THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. AS A RESULT RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON MBTA BUS SERVICE A TRANSPORTATION MODE THAT IS HEAVILY BURDENED BY CONGESTED STREET TRAFFIC AND VEHICLE OVERCROWDING AND AS A RESULT IS OFTEN UNRELIABLE AND VULNERABLE TO DELAYS.PROJECTTHIS TCSP GRANT WILL BE USED BY THE MBTA WORKING WITH ITS COMMUNITY PARTNER THE FAIRMOUNT INDIGO LINE CDC COLLABORATIVE TO MAKE THE FAIRMOUNT LINE MORE VISIBLE TO LOCAL RESIDENTS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES AS A GOOD TRANSIT OPTION TO USE TO GET TO WORK SCHOOL AND STORES. THE GRANT WILL SUPPORT A MAJOR PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE RESIDENTS AWARENESS OF THE FAIRMOUNT SERVICE OPTIONS INCLUDING FARE STRUCTURE AND HOW TO CONNECT FAIRMOUNT/INDIGO LINE TRIPS WITH LOCAL BUS SERVICE AND RAPID TRANSIT CONNECTIONS DOWNTOWN. THIS EFFORT IS NEEDED TO MAKE RESIDENTS AWARE THAT THE LINE IS INDEED FOR THEM AND TO FOSTER TRANSIT AS THE PRIMARY TRANSPORTATION CHOICE IN THE ROXBURY/DORCHESTER/MATTAPAN/HYDE PARK CORRIDOR. FUNDS WILL ALSO BE USED TO DEVELOP A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MBTA AND BUSINESSES IN THE FAIRMOUNT CORRIDOR AND TO MAXIMIZE THE MUTUAL BENEFIT THE UPGRADED LINE CAN HAVE LIKE ATTRACTING MORE SHOPPERS TO LOCAL BUSINESSES HELPING EMPLOYEES GET TO WORK AND ENCOURAGING INCREASED RIDERSHIP THROUGH LOCAL TICKET SALES. THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH-QUALITY SAFE AND EFFICIENT TRANSIT WILL CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE CORRIDOR AND WILL HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE MORE BUSINESSES TO LOCATE AND/OR EXPAND IN THE AREA.
