WESTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY, HOMER STRYKER, MD, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IS A NEWER MEDICAL LOCATED IN KALAMAZOO MICHIGAN WHICH IS HOME TO MANY DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE PATIENTS IN OUR PRIMARY CARE CLINICS.  OUR RESIDENTS COME FROM AROUND THE WORLD WITH VARYING AMOUNTS OF TRAINING IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.  OUR CURRENT ABILITY TO TRAIN OUR RESIDENTS THOROUGHLY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS LIMITED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.  OUR MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF ALL HAVE VERY LONG WAIT LISTS DUE TO UNDERSTAFFING WHICH MAKES IT CHALLENGING TO DEVOTE RESOURCES TO TEACHING RESIDENTS.  GRANT FUNDING WOULD ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, DEVELOP DIDACTIC AND CLINICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR RESIDENTS AND GENERAL PEDIATRIC PEDIATRICIANS, AND EXPAND OUR MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL TEACHING AND CLINICAL RESPONSIBILITIES.  BECAUSE OF THIS GRANT OUR RESIDENCY PROGRAM WILL BE ABLE TO TRAIN UP TO 60 RESIDENTS MANY OF WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE EMPLOYED IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THUS PROVIDING IMPROVED OUTCOMES.  OBJECTIVES  \tOBJECTIVES TO ENHANCE OUR TRAINING IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH INCLUDE; INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TRAINED IN PREVENTION, IDENTIFICATION, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND REFERRAL OF SERVICES FOR MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS; EXPANDING AND DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS TO PROVIDE CLINICAL ROTATIONS; AND DEVELOP AND ENHANCE MENTAL DIDACTIC AND CLINICAL TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE RESIDENTS INCLUDING SUICIDE PREVENTION, TRAUMA INFORMED CARE INC LUDING ABUSE AND GUN VIOLENCE; MATERIALS MUST BE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT. METHODS \tOUR OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ENHANCING OUR CLINICAL AND DIDACTIC TRAINING EXPERIENCES, CREATING A MONTH-LONG MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ROTATION WHICH INCLUDES SITES WITHIN OUR PROGRAM AND A VARIETY OF EXTERNAL SITES.  IN ADDITION, WE PLAN TO START A COLLABORATIVE ADHD CLINIC SPECIFICALLY FOR TEACHING RESIDENTS, DEVELOP A CURRICULUM/TRAINING FOR OUR GENERAL PEDIATRIC PEDIATRICIANS, AND SET UP FORMAL RESIDENT OBSERVATIONS IN COMMUNICATION AND INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION.  WE ARE SETTING UP PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE WMU RESILIENCY CENTER AS WELL AS WITH OUR CURRENT CHILD ABUSE ROTATION TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC TRAINING IN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND CARE THAT IS CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE. WE WILL ALSO WORK WITH THE DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC PSYCHOLOGY UTILIZING PARTS OF THEIR CURRICULUM AND FACULTY TO ASSIST WITH IMPLEMENTING A NEW RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PREPARE RESIDENTS FOR THE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF PROVIDING CARE TO THE UNDERSERVED AND EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING ACCESS FOR THESE COMMUNITIES. CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND EVALUATION WILL ENSURE THE PROJECT MEETS THE EXPECTED GOALS AND RESPONDS TO CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY.  UNDER THIS ENHANCEMENT PROJECT, VHT WILL EXPAND VHTFMRP TRAINING TO INCLUDE PREVENTION, IDENTIFICATION, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND REFERRAL OF SERVICES FOR MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS (SUD) FOR PEDIATRIC, ADOLESCENT, YOUNG ADULT AND OTHER HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS, COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS YOUNG PATIENTS.

STEP 1: STRENGTH VHTFMRP\u2019S OVERALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CURRICULUM BY WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH THE VHT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND EXPANDING OUR PROGRAM REACH BEYOND VHT. VHT\u2019S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WILL ALSO WORK WITH FACULTY TO IDENTIFY EDUCATIONAL  NEEDS AND FACULTY WILL DEVELOP THE ENHANCED DIDACTIC CURRICULUM; CONSULTANTS AND PARTNERS WILL DELIVER TRAINING AND OTHER DIDACTICS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE EXPANDING OUR RESIDENCY FROM A COMPLEMENT OF 12 (4-4-4) TO A COMPLEMENT OF 18 (6-6-6).  LASTLY, VHT WILL PROVIDE TRAINING OTHER LOCAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCIES.  STEP 2: VHT\u2019S RESIDENCY PROGRAM WILL CREATE AND CONDUCT NEW CLINICAL ROTATION EXPERIENCES, INCLUDING A MONTH-LONG ROTATION DURING SENIOR YEAR(S) IN TRAINING FOR FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENTS.  VHT OFFERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AT EVERY CLINICAL SITE AND HAS CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WHO ARE ABLE TO DELIVER THERAPEUTIC SERVICES TO PATIENTS OF ALL AGES, INCLUDING CHILDREN.  THIS VALUABLE ASSET WILL BE LEVERAGED TO AUGMENT THE RESIDENTS\u2019 CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES.   VHT PLANS TO INCORPORATE PATIENT NAVIGATORS INTO THE RESIDENCY\u2019S TRAINING REALM.  QUALITY IMPROVEMENT STUDIES CONDUCTED BY VHTFMRP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE REVEALED THE BENEFITS THESE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS PROVIDE.  RESIDENTS ARE MORE INCLINED TO SCREEN PATIENTS WHEN THEY CAN REFER/LINK PATIENTS TO NEEDED SERVICES.  STEP 3: ADDITIONAL TRAINING TIME WILL BE DEDICATED TO DIDACTIC SESSIONS IN THIS CURRICULAR REALM. THIS INCLUDES CLINICAL ENHANCEMENTS AND DIDACTIC COMPONENTS.  OUR FAMILY MEDICINE FACULTY WILL BECOME A PERPETUAL RESOURCE TO PROVIDE STRONGER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TRAINING BY BECOMING PRIMARY CARE PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP TRAINED.  OUTSIDE CONSULTATIVE SERVICES WILL SUPPLEMENT THE EXPERTISE CONTAINED WITHIN OUR INSTITUTION; THESE SERVICES WILL BE USED FOR HANDS-ON SKILLS TRAININGS FOR PROVIDING BRIEF THERAPY SESSIONS AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED SESSIONS.

SUICIDE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN UTAHNS AGES 15-24, WITH A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RATE OF SUICIDE BY FIREARMS (85% IN UTAH VS 60% IN THE US IN 2017). ACCESS TO CARE IS CHALLENGING IN UTAH\u2019S RURAL AREAS, WHERE ONLY A FEW PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS, OFTEN FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS, PRACTICE, AND MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC FEATURES DISRUPT TRAVEL, FURTHER IMPACTING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. OUR PROJECT AIMS TO IMPROVE THE ACCESS TO MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES BY SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENING COMPETENCIES OF FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS, IN PARTICULAR FOCUSING ON VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. IN SUPPORT OF THIS OVERALL OBJECTIVE, WE HAVE THREE GOALS: 1. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE TRAINED IN THE PREVENTION, IDENTIFICATION, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND REFERRAL OF SERVICES FOR MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WE WILL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY LONGITUDINAL-INTEGRATED CURRICULA FOR MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING ACROSS DIDACTICS, ROTATIONS, AND RESIDENCY YEARS.

DEVELOP OR EXPAND PARTNERSHIPS WITH INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS AND COMMUNITY-BASED OR GANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE CLINICAL ROTATIONS FOR AT LEAST ONE MONTH IN DURATION FOR PRIMARY CARE RESIDENTS. ACCOMPLISHING THIS GOAL WILL RESULT IN AN EXPANDED RANGE OF PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE FAMILY MEDICINE, PROVIDING INCREASED CAPACITY FOR ROTATIONS TO SUPPORT MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN CHILDREN, FAMILIES, AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. 9 NEW PARTNERSHIPS WILL BE DEVELOPED, AND 4 WILL BE ENHANCED. 3. DEVELOP OR ENHANCE MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTENT IN DIDACTIC AND CLINICAL TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE RESIDENTS INCLUDING SUICIDE PREVENTION, TRAUMA INFORMED CARE INCLUDING ABUSE AND GUN VIOLENCE; MATERIALS MUST BE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT. BY REACHING THIS GOAL, FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENTS WILL HAVE 6 MONTHS OF MANDATORY BLOCK ROTATIONS AND 3 MONTHS OF ELECTIVE ROTATIONS TO TRAIN AND PRACTICE MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN INTEGRATED SETTINGS. BY INCORPORATING BOTH DIDACTIC CONTENT AND SUPERVISED CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN MULTIPLE SETTINGS, OUR PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING HRSA STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (SELECTED): 1.

BUILDING UPON PAST SUCCESS AND FOUNDATIONAL WORK OF CURRICULUM ENHANCEMENTS AND EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ROTATION SITES, THIS PROJECT WILL: 1) ENHANCE DFM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (BH) CURRICULUM FOR 42 FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENT PHYSICIANS ANNUALLY (98 OVER THE COURSE OF THE GRANT)  TO INCLUDE CARE OF CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, YOUNG ADULTS, AND ADULTS, BY CREATING A NEW ONE-MONTH MBH ROTATION, THREE BH ELECTIVE ROTATIONS, AND SPECIALIZED LONGITUDINAL DIDACTICS; 2) EXPAND INTERPROFESSIONAL TEAM BASED CARE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AT THREE SITES TO INCREASE INDEPENDENCE IN TREATING BH CONCERNS OF CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS USING INTEGRATED PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (PCBH) PRACTICE MODEL FOR THESE SAME RESIDENTS THROUGH THE ADDITION OF A CONSULTING PSYCHIATRIST AND A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONSULTANT TO THE RESIDENTS\u2019 CARE TEAM; AND 3) INCREASE THE BH CLINICAL SKILLS OF FAMILY MEDICINE FACULTY PRECEPTORS THROUGH EVIDENCE-BASED BH TRAINING AND CME CONFERENCES.   IN ADDITION TO THE TWO ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED (FAMILY MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY) THE PROJECT HAS INVESTED COLLABORATORS INCLUDING THE PIEDMONT HEALTH SERVICES FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS NETWORK (WHICH HOSTS TWO TRAINING TRACKS IN OUR RESIDENCY PROGRAM), WAKEBROOK BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITY,  EL FUTURO (PROVIDES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR LATINO FAMILIES), SOUTHLIGHT HEALTHCARE, THE UNC CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR EATING DISORDERS, THE UNC SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT AND EVALUATION PROGRAM, AND UNC\u2019S VARIOUS SUBSTANCE USE PROGRAMS.  MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS COMPLETING THE REQUIRED MONTH-LONG ROTATION AND LONGITUDINAL DIDACTICS, AS WELL AS THE NUMBER WHO OPT FOR THE ELECTIVE. THE SUCCESS OF THE PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION SERVICE FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AND THE ROLE OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONSULTANT WILL BE MEASURED BY THE CONSULTATIVE ACTIVITY REQUESTED AND COMPLETED, BY BOTH RESIDENTS AND FACULTY. THE PROFESSIONAL SKILLS DEVELOPMENT OF FACULTY WILL BE MEASURED BY THE NUMBER OF FACULTY WHO COMPLETE THE TRAININGS.

THIS IS ALSO TRUE REGARDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS (SUD). UNFORTUNATELY, WE FACE RECORD NUMBERS OF YOUTH WITH MORBIDITIES AND MORTALITY RELATED TO MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE. A RECENT REPORT OF THE 51 STATES/TERRITORIES, RANKED KANSAS LAST IN THE OVERALL RANKING FOR MENTAL HEALTH COMPLAINTS AND ACCESS TO CARE (REINERT, 2022). FURTHER, THE NUMBER OF DRUG-RELATED PEDIATRIC DEATHS IN 2020 INCREASED, WITH OVER A 1,000% INCREASE IN DEATHS RELATED TO FENTANYL (KANSAS STATE CHILD DEATH REVIEW BOARD, 2022). PCPS AND RESIDENTS MUST BE TRAINED TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS AND TO PREVENT FURTHER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN YOUTH.

HIGH MUC PLACEMENT RATE   THE MONTANA FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY (MFMR) HAS BEEN PREPARING COMMUNITY HEALTH-ORIENTED PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS IN FULL SCOPE FAMILY MEDICINE SINCE 1995.    WITH ROOTS AS A STATEWIDE EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES, MFMR WAS FORMED AS A CONSORTIUM MODEL WITH ST VINCENT HEALTHCARE, BILLINGS CLINIC AND RIVERSTONE HEALTH (RSH).   MFMR REMAINED THE ONLY GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM IN THE STATE UNTIL 2013.   MONTANA RANKS 48TH OF THE FIFTY STATES IN THE RATIO OF ACTIVE RESIDENTS PER CAPITA, AND 15 MONTANA COUNTIES EXIST WITHOUT A SINGLE PRACTICING PHYSICIAN.  DESPITE THE CHALLENGE, MFMR HAS PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN EDUCATING PHYSICIANS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN RURAL AND FRONTIER MEDICINE WITH 95 GRADUATES REMAINING IN MONTANA, MOSTLY IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.     SINCE ITS INCEPTION, MFMR HAS PARTNERED WITH RSH WHICH OPERATES A PUBLIC MODEL FEDERALLY-QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER, AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES.  THIS COLLABORATION HAS FOSTERED DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBUST EDUCATIONAL HEALTH CENTER THAT SERVES AS A MODEL FOR BOTH PATIENT CARE AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.   RIVERSTONE HEALTH CLINIC (RSHC), THE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER, INCLUDES A LARGE \u201cMAIN CAMPUS\u201d WHERE MFMR IS BASED, TWO SCHOOL-BASED CLINICS, TWO HEALTHCARE FOR THE HOMELESS CLINICS, AS WELL AS THREE RURAL CLINICS.  SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AT BOTH LOCAL HOSPITALS AND IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIE S AS WELL.   MFMR WAS FULLY INTEGRATED INTO RSH IN 2006, WITH EMPLOYMENT OF RESIDENTS AND FACULTY.   THE CONSORTIUM STRUCTURE AND ASSOCIATED 501(C)3 CORPORATION OF MFMR REMAIN IN PLACE, WITH CRITICAL SUPPORT FROM BOTH LOCAL HOSPITALS IN THE TEACHING AND DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENTS.  IN 2011, MFMR AND RSHC BECAME ONE OF THE ORIGINAL ELEVEN HRSA TEACHING HEALTH CENTER GRANTEES.   MFMR IS EXPANDING FROM AN 8-8-8 RESIDENCY TO A 10-10-10 PROGRAM WITH 10 GRADUATES IN EACH YEAR, BEGINNING IN JULY 2023.      THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ENHANCE THE CURRICULUM FOR FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENTS RELATED TO MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR PEDIATRIC AND YOUNG ADULT PATIENTS.  FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS, AND MFMR GRADUATES IN PARTICULAR, OFTEN PRACTICE IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WITHOUT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS.
