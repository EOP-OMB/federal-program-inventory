AND THEIR IMPACTS ON FATIGUE LIFE OF COMPONENTS MADE BY ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (AM). ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON CHARACTERIZATION AND ANALYSIS OF FOUR COMMONLY USED METAL AM MATERIALS.  THIS RESEARCH WILL BE BROKEN INTO THREE TASKS.  TASK 1 IS TO PERFORM EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS LEADING TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SURFACE FORMATION IN THE ALLOY SYSTEMS.  TASK 2 INVOLVES THE 3D SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE AM SURFACES.  TASK 3 IS TO DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR FATIGUE PERFORMANCE.EXPECTED OUTCOMES: THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN THIS PROJECT WILL LEAD TO A MATERIAL INDEPENDENT APPROACH FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESSING-STRUCTURE-PROPERTIES-PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE FATIGUE PERFORMANCE OF AS-BUILT COMPONENTS WITH ROUGH SURFACES FABRICATED THROUGH AM. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF AM SURFACES AND FATIGUE PERFORMANCE WILL LEAD TO BETTER MEASUREMENT METHODS FOR SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION TO BE DEVELOPED, LEADING TO RAPID QUALIFICATION TOOLS FOR ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED MISSION CRITICAL COMPONENTS.INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WILL SUPPORT GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE COLORADO SCHOOL OF MINES TO DO ADVANCED RESEARCH IN SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION OF ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED PARTS IN A COOPERATIVE MANNER WITH NIST. COLORADO SCHOOL OF MINES FACULTY AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT FROM NIST RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE IN METAL-BASED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING. THE RESEARCH WILL BE OF SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO THE PUBLIC BY PROVIDING RESEARCH RESULTS OF SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS OF ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED SUPER ALLOYS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON FATIGUE LIFE OF SUCH PARTS UNDER HIGH STRESS CONDITIONS.

AS THE GS GET HIGHER AND HIGHER, THE NETWORK TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE AND MORE COMPLEX. FOR EXAMPLE, MASSIVE PHASED-ARRAY ANTENNAS WITH HUNDREDS OF ELEMENTS HAVE BECOME A CRITICAL PART OF THE SYSTEM DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO COMBINE MANY SIGNALS IN SPACE THROUGH BEAMFORMING, WHILE PROVIDING HIGH ANTENNA GAIN TO COMPENSATE FOR THE GREATER PATHLOSS AT THE FREQUENCIES AT WHICH THESE SYSTEMS OPERATE, AT MILLIMETER-WAVE (MMWAVE) FOR 5G AND SUB-TERAHERTZ (SUB-THZ) FOR 6G. SO SPACE OTHERWISE REFERRED TO AS THE ANGLE DOMAIN  IN ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL DELAY DOMAIN IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE DESIGN. NO LESS IMPORTANT IS HOW THE SIGNAL IS DISTORTED ACROSS THE FREQUENCY SPECTRUM I.E. THE FREQUENCY SELECTIVITY OF THE SIGNAL WHICH REALLY ONLY COMES INTO PLAY AT 5G AND ABOVE, WHEN THE SIGNALS ARE ULTRA-WIDEBAND (> 500 MHZ).

THE DUAL-POLARIZED 16 X 16 BOARDS WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE AT AN INSTANTANEOUS BANDWIDTH OF 10 GHZ.

FOR THE FORMER, WORK WILL FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF QUANTUM COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS. FOR THE LATTER, THE GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY PROMISING APPLICATIONS AND DEVELOP TRAINING METHODS FOR SPIKING NEURAL NETWORKS, AN ALTERNATIVE COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEM LOOSELY INSPIRED BY OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE HUMAN BRAIN WORKS\n\n\n\nACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: COLLABORATION WITH THE EUROPEAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS INSTITUTE WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO HELP CLARIFY THE VITAL LINKAGE BETWEEN SECURITY PROOFS FOR IDEALIZED QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY DISTRIBUTION (QKD) SYSTEMS AND THE CHALLENGES OF REAL SYSTEMS BUILD FROM IMPERFECT COMPONENTS. THE PI WILL ALSO APPLY HIS VAST EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING QKD HARDWARE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXPERIMENTAL QUANTUM NETWORK IN COLLABORATION WITH NIST SCIENTISTS. FINALLY, IMPROVED METHODS TO TRAIN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (NN) WILL BE STUDIED, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NN APPLICATIONS AND BENCHMARKS THAT MAP WELL TO SCALABLE, LOW ENERGY NN PLATFORMS SUCH AS THE SUPERCONDUCTING OPTOELECTRONICS NETWORK (SOEN) UNDER STUDY AT NIST WILL BE DEVELOPED.\n\n\n\nEXPECTED OUTCOMES: THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH SUPPORTED BY THIS GRANT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE NEEDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRACTICAL AND RELIABLE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS OF QUANTUM NETWORKS AND SPIKING NEURAL NETWORKS. THE RESULTS OF THIS WORK WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE OPEN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.\n\nINTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THE WORK PROPOSED HERE WILL PROVIDE THE NIST WITH A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN POTENTIAL NEW COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES, ALLOWING IT TO ANTICIPATE NEEDED MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS TO ENABLE DOWNSTREAM COMMERCIALIZATION. WHEN FULLY REALIZED, QUANTUM NETWORKS COULD PROVIDE NEW MEANS OF SECURE INFORMATION EXCHANGE, A WAY TO SCALE CURRENT TODAY?S SMALL QUANTUM COMPONENTS INTO A LARGE, DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING SYSTEM, AS WELL AS TO DEVELOP NEW HIGHLY SENSITIVE SENSING CAPABILITIES. NEUROMORPHIC DEVICES, SUCH AS THE ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO BE STUDIED HERE, COULD PROVIDE VERY HIGH-SPEED PROCESSING FOR CERTAIN APPLICATIONS WITH VERY LOW POWER REQUIREMENTS, WHICH IS A LIMITING FACTOR IN SCALING UP CONVENTIONAL COMPUTING DEVICES. \n\n\n\nSUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES: THERE ARE NO PLANNED SUBAWARDS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8a022699-f7be-356a-f01a-3aa6f76016ef-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_60NANB20D212T_1341"}, {"internal_id": 110314183, "Award ID": "60NANB20D212", "Award Amount": 98745.15, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-04", "CFDA Number": "11.609", "Description": "QUANTIFYING AND EXPLAINING HUMAN-LIKE BIASES IN VISUAL SEMANTICS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "DC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ee8636d0-3f78-fbb3-4346-eb49aabbb2b3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_60NANB20D212_1341"}, {"internal_id": 110314173, "Award ID": "60NANB20D209", "Award Amount": 33458.81, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-14", "CFDA Number": "11.609", "Description": "SECRETARIAT FOR ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 37, BIOMETRICS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "4e9a5ae5-6321-ac01-321d-638bf36a33b3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_60NANB20D209_1341"}, {"internal_id": 110314179, "Award ID": "60NANB20D207", "Award Amount": 110926.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-09", "CFDA Number": "11.609", "Description": "FIRE-RELATED DEATHS: THE IMPACT OF ILLICIT DRUGS, PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, AND OVER-THE-COUNTER SLEEP AIDS ON OCCUPANT NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MD", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "2d63c810-b946-5f4b-02ba-da090a22b6c3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_60NANB20D207_1341"}, {"internal_id": 110314194, "Award ID": "60NANB20D205", "Award Amount": 229710.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-01", "CFDA Number": "11.609", "Description": "A DATA-DRIVEN MANUFACTURABILITY COMPUTATION FRAMEWORK: PROCESS CAPABILITY MEASUREMENT, MODELING, AND QUERIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f7c481d7-071a-ead9-3bda-e4e7d1e903a7-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_60NANB20D205_1341"}, {"internal_id": 110314184, "Award ID": "60NANB20D203", "Award Amount": 199904.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-04", "CFDA Number": "11.609", "Description": "EFFICIENT HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION OF LATTICE-BASED POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "5d3e00c3-06a2-64c0-397d-0912a81a2978-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_60NANB20D203_1341"}, {"internal_id": 110314185, "Award ID": "60NANB20D191", "Award Amount": 100060.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-04", "CFDA Number": "11.609", "Description": "WUI-NITY 2: THE INTEGRATION, VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF THE WILDFIRE EVACUATION PLATFORM WUI-NITY", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "9f5976ca-059b-1ef0-5d34-e43376be8b85-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_60NANB20D191_1341"}, {"internal_id": 149809032, "Award ID": "60NANB20D190T", "Award Amount": 63485.7, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-06-21", "CFDA Number": "11.609", "Description": "PURPOSE:  GENERATE SOFTWARE IN THE FORM OF A COLLECTION OF PYTHON SCRIPTS, AND SETS OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES FOR USE IN FIRE MODELS SUCH AS NIST'S FIRE DYNAMIC SIMULATOR.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: DEVELOP A SUITE OF AUTOMATED CALIBRATION TOOLS FOR DETERMINING CONDENSED PHASE MATERIAL PROPERTY INPUTS FOR FIRE MODELS FROM SMALL-SCALE TEST DATA.
