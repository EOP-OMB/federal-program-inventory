MARINUS OTTE (NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY, NDSU), DR. DONNA JACOB (HOUSTON ENGINEERING INC, HEI), AND MR. AARON LARSEN (NORTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, NDDEQ) ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION RELATING TO WATER QUALITY AND WETLANDS WAS LACKING AND NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED WITH THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IN NORTH DAKOTA. THE STATE HAS LOST AT LEAST 45% OF ITS WETLANDS1, BUT IT IS AS HIGH AS 90% IN OTHER REGIONS2,3,4, AND LOSS OF WETLANDS IS CONTINUING IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD5. AS A RESULT, AN INCALCULABLE VALUE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, SUCH AS SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT RETENTION AND HYDROLOGICAL BUFFERING HAVE BEEN LOST6. HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT CONSTRUCTION OF NEW WETLANDS CAN OFFSET LOSSES &NDASHAND THE TREND IN THE US OVER THE PERIOD OF 2004-2009 SHOWED NO DISCERNIBLE LOSS IN FRESHWATER WETLANDS, MAINLY BECAUSE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW WETLANDS OFFSET LOSSES OF NATURAL WETLANDS TO AGRICULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT5. A PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING HIGHEST PRIORITY IN NORTH DAKOTA IS REDUCTION OF SEDIMENTS AND NUTRIENT LOADING (&LSQUOANDLOADS&RSQUOAND) TO 303(D)-LISTED WATERSHEDS7, MANY INCLUDING RESERVOIRS. MOST OF THE RESERVOIRS WERE CREATED TO REDUCE DOWNSTREAM FLOODING AND AS DRINKING WATER SUPPLY AND TO SUPPORT RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. AN APPROACH OF INTEREST TO NORTH DAKOTA WOULD BE TO INCORPORATE CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS INTO IMPACTED WATERSHEDS WITH A VIEW TO LOWER LOADS. THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE ADDED BENEFITS IN TERMS OF OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY WETLANDS, SUCH AS PROVISION OF HABITATS AND HYDROLOGICAL BUFFERING. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT WETLANDS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING SEDIMENTS AND NUTRIENTS FROM WATER8, 9, 10, AND GUIDANCE ON HOW TO INCORPORATE WETLANDS INTO SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR DECADES, ALSO FROM THE US EPA11. THE MAIN QUESTION THAT THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO ANSWER IS: CAN WETLANDS BE CONSTRUCTED WITHIN 303(D)-LISTED WATERSHEDS IN NORTH DAKOTA TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOADS (TMDLS) TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY?\nTHE IDEA TO INCORPORATE CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS IN THE LANDSCAPE TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY OF ENTIRE WATERSHEDS IS NOT NEW12. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF INTEGRATION OF CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS INTO A SMALL WATERSHED IS THAT OF THE ANNE VALLEY PROJECT ON INTEGRATED CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS IN IRELAND13, WHICH WAS INITIATED IN THE 1990S14. AN EXAMPLE ALSO EXISTS FROM NORTH DAKOTA, WHERE WETLANDS WERE CONSTRUCTED IN THE BOWMAN-HALEY RESERVOIR WATERSHED IN CONJUNCTION WITH BUY-INS FROM LANDOWNERS TO THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM, AND WHERE LOADS WERE REDUCED SUCCESSFULLY15. A MORE RECENT EXAMPLE IS PROVIDED BY FRIENDSOFRESERVOIRS.COM IN THEIR GUIDANCE ON USE OF WETLANDS FOR MITIGATION OF EUTROPHICATION16, WHICH INCLUDES AN EXAMPLE FROM A WATERSHED IN NEBRASKA. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF RESTORATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF WETLANDS IN A WATERSHED, IN THIS CASE PRIMARILY FOR HYDROLOGICAL REASONS, IS THE TONGUE RIVER PROJECT IN NORTHEASTERN ND17. HOWEVER, WHILE GUIDELINES EXIST ABOUT HOW TO DESIGN AND SIZE WETLANDS TO REDUCE POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS IN SPECIFIC WASTE WATERS18, NO STUDIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW MUCH WETLAND (SIZE, DEPTH, DESIGN) WOULD BE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE LOADS OF ENTIRE WATERSHEDS TO BELOW ACCEPTABLE THRESHOLDS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME, ABSENT ANY OTHER MITIGATION MEASURES AND CHANGES IN LAND USES WITHIN THE WATERSHED. IN OTHER WORDS, IS IT POSSIBLE TO DRASTICALLY IMPROVE THE WATER QUALITY OF A WATERSHED IF ONLY THE AREA OF WETLANDS WOULD BE INCREASED? THIS IS OF IMPORTANCE, NOT JUST FOR NORTH DAKOTA, BUT FOR THE ENTIRE US AND BEYOND, BECAUSE IT WILL DETERMINE THE LIMITS OF CONSTRUCTING WETLANDS FOR WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OF WATERSHEDS. ARE THERE ANY SITUATIONS WHERE CONSTRUCTION OF WETLANDS SUFFICES TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY WITHIN WATERSHEDS OR ARE CHANGES IN LAND USES NECESSARY AS WELL IN MOST CASES?

UGS AND UTAH DIVISION OF WATER QUALITY (UDWQ) HAVE A TWO-PHASE PLAN FOR MONITORING WETLANDS IN THE STATE WHEREBY UGS FIRST COLLECTS BASELINE DATA IN AN ECOREGION, DETERMINES AN APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION SCHEME, AND CHARACTERIZES HIGH-QUALITY REFERENCE SITES, AND THEN UDWQ USES THAT DATA TO SELECT WETLAND TARGETS FOR MORE INTENSIVE SAMPLING AND TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE BENEFICIAL USE CLASSES (MENUZ AND DOWNARD, 2017).\nOUR PROPOSED ASSESSMENT OF MONTANE WETLANDS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THREE PARTS. FIRST, WE WILL CREATE A SINGLE DATASET THAT COMBINES WETLAND DATA FROM SEVERAL DATASETS TO MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBES MONTANE WETLAND TYPE AND DISTRIBUTION. WE WILL REVIEW THE ACCURACY OF EXISTING DATASETS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL WETLAND INVENTORY (NWI), NATIONAL LAND COVER DATABASE (NLCD), UTAH DIVISION OF WATER RESOURCES&RSQUOAND WATER RELATED LAND USE (WRLU), AND VEGETATION AND FEN MAPPING FROM THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE (USFS) USING A COMBINATION OF REMOTE SENSING AND FIELD WORK. WE WILL ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER ACCURACY CAN BE IMPROVED BY USING A COMBINATION OF EXISTING DATA. FOR EXAMPLE, NLCD HAS INACCURACIES INHERENT TO REMOTE SENSINGAND ACCURACY MAY BE IMPROVED BY IDENTIFYING OVERLAP BETWEEN NLCD WETLANDS AND AREAS WITH HYDRIC SOILS OR AREAS WITH LOW SLOPE AND HIGH RUNOFF IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPOUND TOPOGRAPHIC INDEX (HORVATH AND OTHERS, 2018). MUCH OF THE NWI DATA IN THE STUDY AREA WERE PRODUCED USING IMAGERY COLLECTED 40 YEARS AGO AND MAY NOT CAPTURE WETLAND LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH RECENT DEVELOPMENTAND ACCURACY MAY BE IMPROVED BY REMOVING WETLANDS THAT OVERLAP DEVELOPED POLYGONS IN THE WRLU LAYER. AFTER INITIAL EVALUATION OF THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH DATASET, WE WILL RANDOMLY SELECT POINTS WITHIN EACH LAYER AND EVALUATE EACH POINT USING A DESKTOP EVALUATION OF AERIAL IMAGERY AND SUPPLEMENTAL LAYERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER EACH POINT IS IN FACT WETLAND. DESKTOP EVALUATION WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH FIELD EVALUATION TO BOTH TRAIN IMAGE INTERPRETERS AND VALIDATE RESULTS. EVALUATIONS WILL BE STRATIFIED BY LEVEL IV ECOREGIONS BECAUSE PREVIOUS WORK HAS FOUND DIFFERENCES IN MAPPING ACCURACY BY ECOREGION (MENUZ AND SEMPLER, 2018). AFTER THE ACCURACY ASSESSMENT, WE WILL COMPILE THE MOST ACCURATE DATA INTO A SINGLE DATASET. THIS DATASET WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOURCE DATA ASSOCIATED WITH EACH FEATURE AND A CONFIDENCE LEVEL ASSIGNED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE ACCURACY ASSESSMENT.
