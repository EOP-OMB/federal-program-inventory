SACK DAM WAS DESIGNED TO IMPOUND FLOWS RELEASED FROM MENDOTA DAM FOR DIVERSIONS INTO THE ARROYO CANAL PURSUANT TO THE EXCHANGE CONTRACT. IT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO ACCURATELY PASS MEASURED FLOW. THE NEW GATES WILL IMPROVE THE ACCURACY TO PASS FLOWS THROUGH SACK DAM, AS OPPOSED TO OVER SACK DAM.  THE NEW GATES WILL BE RATED  THEREFORE, ACCURATE MEASUREMENT CAN BE MAINTAINED THROUGH EACH OF THE GATES AT ALL FLOW RATES WHILE MAINTAINING THE NECESSARY WATER SURFACE ELEVATION UPSTREAM OF THE DAM FOR DIVERSIONS INTO THE ARROYO CANAL.  OBJECTIVE 2:THE NEW GATES WILL BE AUTOMATED AND REDUCE THE FREQUENCY THAT STAFF HAVE TO PHYSICAL REMOVE AND REPLACE THE BOARDS.  AUTOMATION INCREASES THE SAFETY OF STAFF IF THEY DO NOT NEED TO PULL AND REPLACE BOARDS.OBJECTIVE 3:THE NEW GATES WILL REDUCE LEAKAGE IN THE 5 BAYS THEY ARE INSTALLED IN AND REDUCE UNMEASURED SPILLAGE.  OBJECTIVE 4:THE NEW GATES WILL REMOTELY PROVIDE REAL TIME FLOW DATA AND ALLOW FOR THE SHARING OF DATA WITH THE PROGRAM FOR TRACKING FLOWS AND HMRD FOR OPERATIONS.DELIVERABLES AND OUTCOME:  THE PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT OPERATIONS OF THE SACK DAM AND IMPROVING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SETTLEMENT IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY AND ECONOMICALLY SOUND MANNER.BENEFICIARIES: PUBLIC", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "b62f3e17-5cda-ba0a-3068-816a0d67477c-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R23AP00373_1425"}, {"internal_id": 160027060, "Award ID": "R23AC00275", "Award Amount": 1600000.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-15", "CFDA Number": "15.555", "Description": "1.  AWARD PURPOSE - THE RESTORATION GOAL IS TO REINTRODUCE SPRING-RUN ANDFALL-RUN CHINOOK SALMON TO THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER BETWEEN THE FRIANT DAM AND THECONFLUENCE WITH THE MERCED RIVER. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 14, THE UNITED STATES FISH   WILDLIFE (USFWS) SUBMITTED A COMPLETE PERMIT APPLICATION TO THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE (NMFS) FOR REINTRODUCTION OF SPRING-RUN CHINOOK SALMON. ON OCTOBER 11, 2012, NMFS ISSUED SECTION 10(A)(1)(A) PERMIT 14868. THIS PERMIT AUTHORIZES USFWS TO COLLECT, TRANSPORT, REAR, HANDLE, AND TAG INDIVIDUALS TO ESTABLISH A BROODSTOCK OF SPRING-RUN AT THE INTERIM FACILITY, THE SATELLITE INCUBATION AND REARING FACILITY (SIRF), AND THE FUTURE SAN JOAQUIN SALMON CONSERVATION AND RESEARCH FACILITY (SCARF) LOCATED ON THE GROUNDS OF THE EXISTING SAN JOAQUIN FISH HATCHERY IN FRIANT,CALIFORNIA. NO OTHER FACILITIES ARE AUTHORIZED IN THE PERMIT.2.  ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED - THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE:1.  DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A GENETICALLY DIVERSE BROODSTOCK OF SPRING AND POTENTIALLY FALL-RUN CHINOOK TO SUPPORT THE RESTORATION OF CHINOOK SALMON TO SELF-SUSTAINING LEVELS.2.  PRODUCE TARGETS SET BY THE SJRRP TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS OF TANK SPACE AND WATER SUPPLY AT THE INTERIM FACILITY, UNTIL THE FULL- SCALE CONSERVATION FACILITY BECOMES OPERATIONAL.3.  PRODUCE JUVENILE SPRING-RUN CHINOOK TO SUPPORT THE RESTORATION OF CHINOOK SALMON RUNS TO SELF-SUSTAINING LEVELS.4.  ONCE CONSERVATION FACILITY IS OPERATIONAL, CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE INTERIM FACILITY AS REPURPOSED FOR QUARANTINE FACILITY, RESEARCH FACILITY, AND TO HOLD SPAWN RETURNING SPRING-RUN ADULTS FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER FOR EVENTUAL INCORPORATION INTO SCARF BROODSTOCK.5.  OPERATE THE SIRF ON RECLAMATION PROPERTY JUST BELOW FRIANT DAM IN SUPPORT OF SCARF OPERATIONS AND PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.6.  SUPPORT AND PROVIDE RESEARCH NEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTORING SPRING AND OR FALL- RUN CHINOOK POPULATIONS TO SELF-SUSTAINING LEVELS.7.  PREPARE A CONSERVATION PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT TO NMFS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCHEDULE OF ANY APPLICABLE HGMP OR SJRRP GUIDANCE.3.  EXPECTED DELIVERABLE OR OUTCOME - THE BENEFITS TO BE DERIVED FROM THIS COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT INCLUDE: CDFW OPERATING ANDMAINTAINING SCARF IN A MANNER THAT PRODUCES SPRING-RUN CHINOOK SALMON TO BE RELEASED TO THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER IN SUPPORT OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS RESTORATION GOAL TO RESTORE AND MAINTAIN FISH POPULATIONS IN GOOD CONDITION IN THE MAIN STEM OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER BELOW FRIANT DAM TO THE CONFLUENCE OF THE MERCED RIVER, INCLUDING NATURALLY REPRODUCING AND SELF-SUSTAINING POPULATIONS OF SALMON AND OTHER FISH.THE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT WORKGROUP OF THE SJRRP DETERMINED THAT DEVELOPMENT OF A CAPTIVE REARING PROGRAM IS CRITICAL TO THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF RESTORING SPRING-RUN CHINOOK SALMON TO THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER (SJRRP 2010, FMWG 2011). ACCORDINGLY, THE SJRRP PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCARF. FACILITY OPERATIONS ARE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE COORDINATED WITH A MULTI-AGENCY TECHNICAL TEAM THAT WILL PROVIDE INPUT ONOPERATIONS TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE SJRRPS HATCHERY AND GENETIC MANAGEMENTPLAN (HGMP  SJRRP 2010).4.  INTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES) - AS A BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC, THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE SPRING-RUN CHINOOK SALMON POPULATION ON THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER THAT WOULD ENHANCE THE OVERALL ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF THE SPECIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS RECOVERY.  CONSERVATION FACILITY OPERATIONS WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD OF FISH REINTRODUCTION AND FOR FISHERIES MANAGEMENT.5.
