THERE ARE PROFOUND DISPARITIES IN ECC EXPERIENCES SUCH THAT CHILDREN FROM MINORITY AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES SUFFER A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DISEASE BURDEN. THE LIKELIHOOD OF PARENTS OF HIGH-ECC RISK YOUNG CHILDREN SEEKING PREVENTION IN DENTAL FACILITIES IS LOW; THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED TO INCREASE PREVENTIVE DENTAL OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THESE CHILDREN ALREADY SEEK HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE ECC BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS FOR USE IN PUBLIC HEALTH SETTINGS ATTENDED BY HIGH-RISK CHILDREN. MANY AUTHORS RECOMMEND EARLY IMPLEMENTATION OF ORAL HEALTH EDUCATION AS ONE MEANS OF PREVENTING ECC. HOWEVER, MAJOR ISSUES DISCUSSED IN THE ORAL HEALTH PROMOTION LITERATURE INVOLVE A LACK OF EFFECTIVENESS AMONG PROGRAMS BASED ON EDUCATION ALONE, AS WELL AS A LACK OF HIGH QUALITY PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS USING EVIDENCE-BASED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES.  OUR RESEARCH TEAM HAS BEEN THE FIRST TO INTRODUCE TO THE ECC PREVENTION ARENA THE SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY (SDT) OF MOTIVATION, INTERNALIZATION, AND HEALTHY FUNCTIONING, PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES IN SEVERAL OTHER FIELDS, INCLUDING ORAL HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT SDT HAS GREAT PROMISE AS A MOTIVATIONAL APPROACH BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE, BASED ON RESULTS FROM OUR R21 (R21-DE016483) STUDY, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SDT IN CHANGING SEVERAL DESIRABLE ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS FOR ECC PREVENTION.

THE SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE OF USING THE KRT14-CRE MOUSE FOR ENAMEL RESEARCH IS THAT KRT14 IS EXPRESSED IN MULTIPLE TISSUES INCLUDING SKIN, BRONCHIAL EPITHELIA, TONGUE, TRACHEA, SALIVARY GLANDS, AND MANY MORE ORGANS, AND BECAUSE OF THIS MANY OF THE DEVELOPED LOXP MOUSE LINES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE TO STUDY AMELOGENESIS. FOR EXAMPLE, MRNA EXPRESSION LEVELS OF THE ANION EXCHANGER PROTEIN (SLC4A2/AE2), OR THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR), INCREASES ~ 6-FOLD AND 3-FOLD RESPECTIVELY IN THE ENAMEL ORGAN DURING MATURATION STAGE (COMPARED TO SECRETORY STAGE), AND BEYOND TOOTH FORMATION BOTH GENES ARE WIDELY EXPRESSED IN LUNG AND PANCREAS AND ARE CRITICAL TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

BICARBONATE IS KNOWN TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACID GENERATED BY MINERAL DEPOSITION, BUT WHY ABSENCE OF THE CITRATE TRANSPORTER (NACT) ENCODED BY SLC13A5 CAUSES SEVERE ENAMEL MALFORMATIONS IS UNKNOWN. SLC13A5 IS REQUIRED IN SOFT (LIVER, BRAIN) AND HARD (BONE, TEETH) TISSUES. SURPRISINGLY ~80% OF ALL CITRATE IN THE BODY IS IN BONE.

THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN YOUNG CHILDREN WHO NEED EXTENSIVE TREATMENT, OR ARE UNCOOPERATIVE AND/OR HAVE IMMATURE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING, DISABILITIES, OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS, WHERE TREATMENT UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA, IN MOST CASES IN HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOMS, IS THE STANDARD OF CARE. IN 2016, THE FDA ISSUED A NOTICE TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT GENERAL ANESTHESIA IN YOUNG CHILDREN CAN RESULT IN PERMANENT NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED. THUS, BETTER STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE CAVITATED CARIES LESIONS IN YOUNG CHILDREN. THE PROPOSED RCT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY TARGETING YOUNG CHILDREN ENROLLED IN HEAD START PROGRAMS WHO HAVE CAVITATED CARIES LESIONS THAT HAVE EXPOSED DENTIN CLINICALLY. BECAUSE OF THE BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY STATUS FOR SDF, FDA HAS BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN OF THIS TRIAL TO ENSURE IT WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A CAVITATED CARIES LESION \u201cARREST\u201d DRUG CLAIM, WHICH IS INNOVATIVE IN THE U.S. THE PROPOSED PROTOCOL IN THIS APPLICATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED BY ADVANTAGE SILVER DENTAL ARREST, LLC, HOLDER OF IND 124808, TO THE FDA AS PART OF OUR COLLABORATION. IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF FUNDING, WE WILL WORK WITH NIDCR TO REVIEW ALL RELEVANT STUDY DOCUMENTS AND MANUALS FOR THE RCT, SUBMIT TO IRBS, AND CALIBRATE ALL STUDY EXAMINERS. FOLLOWING THIS STUDY PREPARATION PERIOD, AN EXPERIENCED RESEARCH TEAM WILL CONDUCT A PHASE III, MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED SUPERIORITY TRIAL, WITH TWO PARALLEL GROUPS INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 1,040 CHILDREN, 2-5 YEARS OLD, WHO WILL BE FOLLOWED OVER A PERIOD OF 8 MONTHS, TO ASSESS: THE TOOTH-AIM 1 (PRIMARY STUDY AIM)- THE IMPACT OF 38% SDF APPLIED TWICE, 6 MONTHS APART, ON ARREST OF CAVITATED LESIONS IN THE PRIMARY DENTITION (ASSESSED USING THE ICDAS II SEVERITY AND ACTIVITY CRITERIA). SECONDARY AIMS WILL FURTHER ASSESS WHETHER THE PROVISION OF SDF IMPACTS: THE CHILD-AIM 2 [EFFECTS OF SDF ON CHILDREN'S PAIN AND PULPAL INFECTION], AND THE FAMILY-AIM 3 [EFFECTS OF SDF ON ORAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SUB-AIM 3A), AND TREATMENT SATISFACTION AND ACCEPTABILITY (SUB-AIM 3B)]. THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS INNOVATIVE PROJECT IS THAT PROVISION OF AND ACCESS TO A NON-INVASIVE, INEXPENSIVE, AND SIMPLE TO USE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY TO MANAGE CAVITATED CARIES LESIONS FOR CHILDREN WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO CARE COULD PROFOUNDLY IMPROVE ORAL HEALTH BY ARRESTING LESIONS, REDUCING PAIN, IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING COSTS, ALL CONTRIBUTING TO SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN DISPARITIES IN CARIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1567efcf-bcdb-61b9-72f2-70cbed5fa626-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UH3DE027372_7529"}, {"internal_id": 50111356, "Award ID": "UH3DE025514", "Award Amount": 3821931.3, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2017-08-14", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "INFLUENCE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ON ORAL DISEASE MANAGEMENT IN YOUNG CHILDREN", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bb8d1cd4-e0ae-6348-a07c-04df6a112768-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UH3DE025514_7529"}, {"internal_id": 50111355, "Award ID": "UH3DE025492", "Award Amount": 4778858.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2017-08-14", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "INTERACTIVE PARENT-TARGETED TEXT MESSAGING IN PEDIATRIC CLINICS TO REDUCE ECC", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0f62abfa-f880-18c2-5e58-a64739477e1e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UH3DE025492_7529"}, {"internal_id": 50111354, "Award ID": "UH3DE025487", "Award Amount": 5883953.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2017-08-14", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "MULTI-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE CARIES DISPARITIES IN PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "59649428-1ebf-ef93-ea43-2491b55b3188-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UH3DE025487_7529"}, {"internal_id": 50111353, "Award ID": "UH3DE025483", "Award Amount": 3819420.13, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2017-08-14", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "COORDINATED ORAL HEALTH PROMOTION (CO-OP) CHICAGO", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "98f86457-cdff-6b3c-9ff8-3a4415183bf6-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UH3DE025483_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151947442, "Award ID": "UH2DE032208", "Award Amount": 420198.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-08", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC MULTI-OMICS OF TMJ DISORDERS - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT TEMPOROMANDIBULAR DISORDERS (TMD) REPRESENT A SPECTRUM OF PAINFUL DISORDERS THAT AFFLICTS APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10% OF THE US POPULATION WITH APPROXIMATE ANNUAL HEALTHCARE COSTS OF $4 BILLION. DEGENERATIVE DISORDERS, INTERNAL DERANGEMENTS INCLUDING DISC DISPLACEMENT AND HYPO/HYPER-MOBILITY, AND ARTHRALGIA OF THE TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT (TMJ), WHICH TOGETHER ARE REFERRED TO AS TMJ DISORDERS (TMJDS), ARE COMMON IN MANY SUBJECTS WITH TMD.

INCLUDING A MAJORITY OF YOUTH AND ADULTS. HEALTH DISPARITIES IN ORAL HEALTH HAVE PERSISTED FOR DECADES, WITH LOWER-INCOME YOUTH, BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINX MINORITIES BEING ESPECIALLY AT RISK FOR DENTAL CARIES. ALTHOUGH ADOLESCENCE IS AN IDEAL TIME TO IMPLEMENT HEALTHY BEHAVIORAL HABITS THAT WILL BE SUSTAINED INTO ADULTHOOD, THERE IS A DEARTH OF EFFECTIVE DENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK ADOLESCENTS. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT PRIMARY ORAL HEALTH PROMOTION STRATEGIES DURING ADOLESCENCE INCLUDE IMPROVING DENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS, ABSTAINING FROM TOBACCO USE AND VAPING, AND REDUCING SUGAR CONSUMPTION. FOLLOWING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND INFORMED BY OUR FORMATIVE RESEARCH FINDINGS, OUR PROPOSED DIGITAL DENTAL PROGRAM FOR ADOLESCENTS WILL TARGET THREE ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR DOMAINS: TWICE-DAILY TOOTH BRUSHING WITH FLUORIDE TOOTHPASTE, ABSTAINING FROM TOBACCO USE, INCLUDING VAPING, AND REDUCING CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES. GROUNDED IN THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR, AUGMENTED BY THE PROTOTYPE/WILLINGNESS MODEL FOR ADOLESCENTS, THE PROPOSED CROSS-PLATFORM DIGITAL PROGRAM WILL TARGET THEORETICALLY BASED MECHANISMS TO PROMOTE THESE THREE TARGETED ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS.

IN THE 4-YEAR UH3 PHASE, WE WILL RECRUIT 270 ADOLESCENTS WITH AUTISM, RANDOMIZE PARTICIPANTS TO 1 OF 2 ARMS, AND COMPARE OUTCOMES. THE TRIAL WILL LAST 3 MONTHS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS TOOTHBRUSHING DISTRIBUTION, DEFINED AS THE MEAN PROPORTION OF TOOTH SURFACES BRUSHED DURING THE LAST MONTH OF THE 3-MONTH INTERVENTION AND MEASURED IN EACH ARM BY THE RESPECTIVE APP. SECONDARY OUTCOMES ARE TOOTHBRUSHING DURATION AND FREQUENCY. WE HYPOTHESIZE ADOLESCENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL ARM WILL EXHIBIT BETTER TOOTHBRUSHING DISTRIBUTION, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY THAN THOSE IN THE CONTROL ARM. APP DATA WILL BE COLLECTED CONTINUOUSLY DURING THE 3-MONTH TRIAL AND UP TO 3-MONTHS POST-TRIAL. SURVEY DATA WILL BE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, 2 WEEKS, 1 MONTHS, 2 MONTHS, AND 3 MONTHS TO ASSESS MEDIATORS (E.G., SELF-EFFICACY) AND EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., HABIT FORMATION, QUALITY OF LIFE). POST-TRIAL SURVEYS WILL ASSESS LONG-TERM CHANGE AND INTERVIEWS WITH 60 PARTICIPANTS FROM THE 2 ARMS WILL IDENTIFY WAYS TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE INTERVENTION. IF FOUND TO BE EFFICACIOUS, OUR FINDINGS COULD ADDRESS AN UNRESOLVED PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS OVER 1.2 MILLION U.S. CHILDREN AND TEENS WITH AUTISM.

IN AYAS, AN OPIOID PRESCRIPTION AFTER A DENTAL PROCEDURE INCREASES THE RISK OF OPIOID MISUSE, USE DISORDER, AND OVERDOSE. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK TO REDUCE OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS TO AYAS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE DENTAL PAIN. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION AT REDUCING DENTAL OPIOID PRESCRIPTION RATES AFTER TOOTH EXTRACTION IN AYAS. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT A MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN POST-EXTRACTION OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS TO AYAS. THE RATIONALE UNDERLYING THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT A MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION WILL ADDRESS PROVIDER KNOWLEDGE, MOTIVATION, AND CHOICE ARCHITECTURE BETTER THAN A SINGLE-COMPONENT STRATEGY; WILL ENGAGE AND EDUCATE PATIENTS; AND WILL PROVIDE A PHYSICAL ITEM FOR DISTRIBUTION INSTEAD OF AN OPIOID PRESCRIPTION. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY PURSUING FOUR SPECIFIC AIMS: IN THE UG3 PERIOD, 1) COMPLETE REQUISITE PRELIMINARY WORK TO TEST A NEW APPROACH TO MANAGE ACUTE PAIN FOLLOWING DENTAL TREATMENT, AND IN THE UH3 PERIOD: 1) ESTABLISH EFFECTIVENESS OF A NOVEL EDUCATIONAL AND DRUG-DISPENSING APPROACH USING ACADEMIC DETAILING, PATIENT EDUCATION, AND BLISTER-PACKAGED NON-OPIOID ANALGESICS TO REDUCE OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS FOLLOWING TOOTH EXTRACTION AMONG AYAS; 2) EXAMINE KEY IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES OF THE INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO MODIFY DENTAL PROFESSIONAL DECISION-MAKING BEHAVIORS; AND 3) ASSESS PATIENT-REPORTED PAIN MANAGEMENT, ANALGESIC USE, AND DRUG DISPOSAL AFTER TOOTH EXTRACTION. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS, WE PROPOSE A STEPPED WEDGE CLUSTER RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF COMMUNITY AND ACADEMIC CLINICS ACROSS KENTUCKY USING AN INNOVATIVE INTERVENTION OF ONE-ON-ONE PROVIDER EDUCATION PLUS PROVIDER DISTRIBUTION OF PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS AND STANDARDIZED BLISTER PACKS CONTAINING ACETAMINOPHEN AND IBUPROFEN.

SECONDARY ENDPOINTS INCLUDE INTERVENTION ACCEPTABILITY, APPROPRIATENESS, FEASIBILITY, AND FIDELITY (UH3 AIM 2); AND PATIENT-REPORTED PAIN, PAIN INTERFERENCE, ANALGESIC USE, AND DRUG DISPOSAL (UH3 AIM 3). THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR WIDE-SCALE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERVENTIONS TO MODIFY DENTAL DECISION-MAKING BEHAVIORS TOWARDS EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACUTE PAIN MANAGEMENT, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN OPIOID PRESCRIPTION RATES AFTER TOOTH EXTRACTION. THE EXPECTED OUTCOME IS A FRAMEWORK TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE DENTAL OPIOID PRESCRIBING TO AYAS.

TREATING YOUNG CHILDREN FOR S-ECC OFTEN REQUIRES DENTAL SURGERY UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA (DGA). UNFORTUNATELY, SURGERY IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE CURE. A DGA EVENT DOES NOT ADDRESS UNDERLYING ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS SUCH AS TOOTH BRUSHING AND DIET, SO CARIES COMMONLY RECURS. CHANGING ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS IS CHALLENGING, AS PARENTS STRUGGLE WITH CONCURRENT LIFE STRESSORS. HOWEVER, PARENTS WANT TO CHANGE THEIR CHILD\u2019S ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND IDENTIFY THAT THEY NEED HELP TO ENACT CHANGE AT THE TIME OF A DGA EVENT. WE PROPOSE A BEHAVIORAL PARENTING INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE WITHIN FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN EXPERIENCE THE MOST SEVERE DISEASE BURDEN AT A CRITICAL POINT IN THEIR CHILD\u2019S ORAL HEALTH. WE WILL DEVELOP AND TEST THE EFFICACY OF PROTECT (PREVENTING RECURRENT OPERATIONS TARGETING EARLY CHILDHOOD CARIES TREATMENT), A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER (CHW)-DELIVERED, BEHAVIORAL PARENTING INTERVENTION FOR PRESCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN SCHEDULED FOR DGA.

IF LEFT UNTREATED, PERIODONTITIS CAN LEAD TO TOOTH LOSS AND PATIENT-PERCEIVED MORBIDITY. HISTORICALLY, ANTIBIOTIC USE HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE TREATMENT. HOWEVER, ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP CALLS FOR RATIONALIZING THEIR PRESCRIPTION TO REDUCE ANTIBIOTIC MISUSE AND DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANT STRAINS. ACROSS MEDICAL DISCIPLINES, THERE IS A CLEAR DIRECTION TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO IN FACT MAY BENEFIT FROM ANTIBIOTIC USE AND TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR THEIR USE.

THUS, DENTISTS ARE LEFT TO DECIDE WHEN ADJUNCTIVE ANTIBIOTICS ARE INDICATED, AND WHICH DENTAL PATIENTS NEED THEM TO ACHIEVE PERIODONTAL HEALTH. IN THE CONTEXT OF PERIODONTITIS TREATMENT, A BIOLOGICAL RATIONALE EXISTS TO SUPPORT ADJUNCTIVE ANTIBIOTIC USE AGAINST PERIODONTAL PATHOGENIC BACTERIA, BUT CLINICAL RESULTS OF THEIR USE HAVE PRESENTED CONFLICTING RESULTS. CURRENTLY, VERY LIMITED DOCUMENTATION OF THE PRESCRIPTION PATTERNS AND UTILIZATION OF ANTIBIOTICS AS PERIODONTAL TREATMENT ADJUNCTS AMONG US PRACTITIONERS EXIST. NONETHELESS, DATA FROM ACADEMIC STUDIES SUGGEST THAT ADJUNCTIVE SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS MAY ONLY BE BENEFICIAL FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS, AS THE BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO TREATMENT IS HIGHLY VARIABLE ACROSS INDIVIDUALS.

THIS WILL ALLOW US TO ESTABLISH INTERVENTION FEASIBILITY/ACCEPTABILITY IN OUR TARGET POPULATION, AND TO ESTABLISH TREATMENT FIDELITY ACROSS CENTERS (AIM 2). THIS PILOT WILL ALSO DEMONSTRATE WHETHER THE INTERVENTION ENGAGES PROPOSED BEHAVIORAL TARGETS (I.E., PARENTS\u2019 READING BEHAVIORS) (AIM 3). IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE (UH3), WE WILL CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF THE INTERVENTION WITH 320 CHILDREN WITH ORAL CLEFTS AND THEIR PARENTS. WE WILL ENROLL PARTICIPANTS AFTER PALATE REPAIR (AGES 16-20 MONTHS) AND RANDOMIZE HALF TO RECEIVE THE INTERVENTION AND THE OTHER HALF TO AN INFORMATION -ONLY CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION WILL CONSIST OF 3 IN PERSON SESSIONS AND 12 REMOTE SESSIONS DELIVERED FROM BASELINE THROUGH AGE 36-MONTHS. AIMS FOR THE RCT INCLUDE (1) TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INTERVENTION IMPROVES CHILDREN\u2019S LANGUAGE AND LITERACY OUTCOMES AT AGE 36 MONTHS; (2A) TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INTERVENTION IMPROVES CAREGIVERS\u2019 SHARED READING BEHAVIORS AND (2B) THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN CHILD OUTCOMES ARE MEDIATED BY CHANGES IN CAREGIVERS\u2019 SHARED READING BEHAVIORS; AND (3) EXAMINE HETEROGENEITY IN OUTCOMES BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, AND INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST STUDY TO EXAMINE AN INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS LANGUAGE AND LITERACY DEFICITS OBSERVED IN CHILDREN WITH ORAL CLEFTS. IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING CARE FOR CHILDREN WITH ORAL CLEFTS, THE STRATEGIES USED TO EXTEND THE REACH OF INTERVENTION TO RURAL AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE FAMILIES WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION DELIVERY IN MANY OTHER CHILD POPULATIONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e050350a-3939-bf65-9585-238517e3ab1f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UG3DE029753_7529"}, {"internal_id": 97852533, "Award ID": "UG3DE029453", "Award Amount": 648160.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-05-22", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "A STEPPED-CARE APPROACH TO TREATING DENTAL FEAR: A SEQUENTIAL, MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENT, RANDOMIZED TRIAL FOR COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT VIA MOBILE APP AND EVIDENCE-BASED COLLABORATIVE CARE", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1a393a49-766e-9cd8-5c8e-3e7c437ef8f0-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UG3DE029453_7529"}, {"internal_id": 96203724, "Award ID": "UG3DE029443", "Award Amount": 576366.03, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-04-03", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "BIRTH TO THREE ?

DISEASE (SJD, FORMERLY KNOWN AS SJ\u00d6GREN\u2019S SYNDROME) IS A COMMON SYSTEMIC AUTOIMMUNE RHEUMATIC DISORDER SECOND ONLY TO RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN PREVALENCE. IT PRIMARILY AFFECTS SALIVARY AND LACRIMAL GLANDS THROUGH LYMPHOCYTIC INFILTRATION AND AUTOANTIBODY-MEDIATED INFLAMMATION, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY. APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF SJD PATIENTS HAVE EXTRAGLANDULAR INVOLVEMENT AND HAVE A REMARKABLY ELEVATED RISK FOR LYMPHOMA. UNFORTUNATELY, LIMITED PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN ADDRESSING THE MANY UNMET NEEDS IN SJD. CONFIRMATORY DIAGNOSIS IS MULTIDISCIPLINARY IN NATURE AND OFTEN RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT DELAY. SCANT THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS EXIST OUTSIDE OF SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, AND RESULTS FROM RECENT CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTING. THUS, A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATHOGENETIC MECHANISMS OF DISEASE IS CRITICAL, AND CAN BE ACHIEVED USING A DE- AND RE-CONSTRUCTION APPROACH. CENTRAL TO THIS GOAL, IS THE NEED FOR DEEPLY CHARACTERIZED PATIENTS WITH SJD. THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY SJ\u00d6GREN\u2019S TEAM FOR ACCELERATING MEDICINES PARTNERSHIP (STAMP) IS IDEALLY POISED TO ASSEMBLE THIS RESOURCE. THE TEAM\u2019S EXPERTISE INCLUDES AUTOIMMUNITY-FOCUSED MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, GENETIC, AND EPIDEMIOLOGIC/CLINICAL RESEARCH, AND A REMARKABLE TRACK-RECORD IN ESTABLISHING LARGE COHORTS OF PARTICIPANTS WITH STORED BIOSPECIMENS AND EXQUISITELY DETAILED PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERIZATION. IN ADDITION TO RECRUITING NEW PARTICIPANTS, THE EXISTING COHORTS WILL PROVIDE THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM 10 TO 15-YEAR FOLLOW-UP OF PREVIOUSLY EVALUATED SJD PARTICIPANTS. OUR PROPOSED DISEASE TEAM (DT) IS STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED TO APPLY CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES TO INTERROGATE THE TISSUE AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY OF SJD TO IDENTIFY THERAPEUTIC PATHWAYS AND TARGETS, WITH THE FOLLOWING AIMS: 1) PLANNING PHASE: DEVELOP A 5-YEAR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AGENDA AND SOPS FOR PHENOTYPING SJD PATIENTS IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER AMP DTS AND TECHNOLOGY AND ANALYTICS CORES (TACS). DESIGN STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS TO RECRUIT, ENROLL, COLLECT BIOSPECIMENS AND PERFORM DEEP PHENOTYPING OF OBSERVATIONAL COHORTS OF SJD AND CONTROLS. IDENTIFY RESEARCH PRIORITIES FOR SJD TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR AND PHENOTYPIC HETEROGENEITY AND NATURAL HISTORY AT BOTH TISSUE AND CELL LEVELS; 2) PILOT PHASE: CALIBRATE CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS AND SAMPLE PROCUREMENT ACROSS RECRUITMENT SITES AND EVALUATE SOPS. WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER DTS AND TACS TO A) FINALIZE SOPS AND IMPLEMENT THEM AT ALL SITES; B) LEVERAGE OUR MULTIDISCIPLINARY EXPERTISE TO INITIATE THE DECONSTRUCTION-RECONSTRUCTION OF SJD VIA PRELIMINARY ANALYSES OF MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL DATA; 3) SCALE UP PHASE: INCREASE PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT AND WORK WITH TAC TO MOLECULARLY DECONSTRUCT AND RECONSTRUCT SJD. STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS IMPLEMENTED ACROSS SITES WILL ENABLE STAMP TO INTERROGATE THE TISSUE AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY OF SJD USING DEEP SEQUENCING AND OTHER CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND 1) THE PATHOGENESIS OF SJD AND IDENTIFY THERAPEUTIC TARGETS, AND NEW BIOMARKERS; AND 2) DISEASE MECHANISMS INHERENT TO PROGRESSION OF SJD FROM NON-SJD TO SJD, AND FROM \u201cEARLY SJD\u201d TO \u201cADVANCED SJD\u201d.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bb8d1cd4-e0ae-6348-a07c-04df6a112768-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_UC2DE032254_7529"}, {"internal_id": 147540662, "Award ID": "UC2AR081031", "Award Amount": 1312309.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-03-22", "CFDA Number": "93.846", "Description": "SINGLE CELL AND SPATIAL GENOMIC ANALYSES OF SPECIMENS FROM PATIENTS WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES (TECHNOLOGY CORE) - TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR PATHWAYS DRIVING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, WE PROPOSE TO DEEPLY PROFILE BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA), PSORIASIS (PS), PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS (PSA), PRIMARY SJ\u00d6GREN\u2019S SYNDROME (PSS) AND SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE). WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE AMP AIM NETWORK, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE COHORTS AND CLINICAL QUESTIONS DEFINED BY THE NETWORK OF CLINICIANS, BIOLOGISTS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGISTS TOGETHER WITH INDUSTRY AND NON-PROFIT PARTNERS. FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY CORE, WE SELECTED LEADING-EDGE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TECHNOLOGIES TO DEEPLY PROFILE END ORGANS AS WELL AS PERIPHERAL BLOOD FROM PATIENTS WITH AUTOIMMUNITY. WE ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS WITH EXPERTISE IN EACH DISEASE AND TISSUE TYPE, AND WHO HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT HIGH- THROUGHPUT PIPELINES TO PROFILE TISSUE AND BLOOD SAMPLES. TO HELP US DESIGN AND INTERPRET THE STUDIES, WE RECRUITED A TEAM OF COLLABORATORS AND CONSULTANTS WITH CLINICAL EXPERTISE IN EACH DISEASE, WITH PATHOLOGY EXPERTISE IN EACH TISSUE AND WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN SPATIAL PROFILING METHODS. IN THE FIRST YEAR, WE WILL CARRY OUT THE PILOT PHASE TO OPTIMIZE PIPELINES FOR: I) PRESERVING AND DISAGGREGATING TISSUES; II) PROFILING SINGLE CELLS USING SCRNA-SEQ/CITE-SEQ/TCR-BCR-SEQ; III) PROFILING SINGLE NUCLEI BY SNRNA-SEQ/SNATAC-SEQ; IV) PREPARING TISSUES FOR TWO COMPLEMENTARY, LEADING-EDGE METHODS FOR SPATIAL TRANSCRIPTOMICS (VISIUM) AND TRANSCRIPT IMAGING (MERFISH). WE WILL ITERATE THE PROTOCOLS TO OPTIMIZE CELL VIABILITY AND YIELD, TECHNICAL QUALITY METRICS SPECIFIC TO EACH TECHNOLOGY AND THE REPRESENTATION OF ALL CELL TYPES. IN YEAR 2, WE WILL RUN THE FULL SET OF SCALED- UP TECHNOLOGY PIPELINES USING ~50 SAMPLES PER TISSUE TYPE, AND WILL ASSESS DATA QUALITY, SITE AND BATCH EFFECTS AND TECHNICAL ARTIFACTS TO INFORM POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS FOR THE SINGLE-CELL PIPELINE. IN YEARS 3-5, WE WILL PROFILE THE REMAINING ~1000 BIOPSIES AND ~1000 BLOOD SAMPLES COLLECTED BY THE DISEASE TEAMS. WE WILL DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL PIPELINE FOR DATA PRE-PROCESSING, PRIMARY BIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND QUALITY METRICS (INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AT THE SCALE OF GENES, CELLS AND TISSUES) WITH CUSTOMIZED FEATURES FOR EACH TISSUE AND DISEASE. OUR FINDINGS WILL BE RAPIDLY COMMUNICATED WITHIN OUR TECHNOLOGY CORE AND ACROSS THE NETWORK TO THE DISEASE TEAMS, SYSTEMS BIOLOGY CORE, NETWORK COMMITTEES OVERSEEING THE PROJECT, NIH, FNIH AND OUR INDUSTRY AND NON-PROFIT PARTNERS. WE WILL ALSO RESPOND IN REAL TIME TO ADVANCING CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGIES AND WORK WITH THE NETWORK TO PILOT AND SCALE UP CRITICAL METHODS.

THE FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE OF THESE RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES IS STRUCTURAL RACISM, WHICH OPERATES VIA INTERCONNECTED, MUTUALLY REINFORCING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PATHWAYS.

ALTHOUGH EFFECTIVE IN CURING THE CANCER, DELETERIOUS RT EFFECTS UPON ORGANS-AT-RISK (OARS) SUCH AS THE SALIVARY GLANDS, SWALLOWING/MASTICATORY MUSCLES, AND MANDIBULAR BONE CAN RESULT IN LIFELONG SEQUELAE OF RT NORMAL TISSUE INJURY SUCH AS XEROSTOMIA, DYSPHAGIA, AND OSTEORADIONECROSIS (ORN), RESPECTIVELY. THESE LONG-TERM SEQUELAE IN A PATIENT POPULATION WITH GOOD CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCY ARE INCREASINGLY RELEVANT AS LATENT SOURCES OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN CANCER SURVIVORSHIP. DESPITE THIS URGENCY, A STANDARDIZED STAGING AND MONITORING SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING ORN AND OTHER MORBIDITIES, AND TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONAL THERAPIES, IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  AT OUR INSTITUTION, DYNAMIC CONTRAST-ENHANCED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (DCE-MRI) IS BEING INTEGRATED INTO A MULTIMODALITY CLINICAL ALGORITHM AIMED AT IMPROVING DIAGNOSIS, STAGING, AND SURVEILLANCE OF DISEASE AND TOXICITY.

THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CRANIOFACIAL SKELETAL DEFORMITY AND TMJ DISORDERS, WITH DEGENERATIVE CHANGES IN 43% OF CLASS II AND 20% OF CLASS III DEFORMITIES, BUT ONLY IN 3% OF CLASS I (I.E., NO SKELETAL DEFORMITY). MOREOVER, CLASS II FEMALES WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE SMALLER CONDYLES, HAVE A MUCH HIGHER RISK TO DEVELOP TMJ DYSFUNCTION. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT CRANIOFACIAL SKELETAL DEFORMITY MAY BE AN IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TMJ DISORDERS, ONLY STUDYING MORPHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS HAS NOT GIVEN ANY INSIGHT INTO A BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM OR A CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP. ADDITIONALLY, ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY CAN BE BENEFICIAL BY ADJUSTING SKELETAL MORPHOLOGY, BUT ITS EFFICACY ON TMJ FUNCTION IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD.  JOINT MORPHOLOGY DRIVES BIOMECHANICS, WHICH IN TURN REGULATES MECHANOBIOLOGY IN JOINT TISSUE REMODELING. IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISTIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CRANIOFACIAL MORPHOLOGY, TMJ BIOMECHANICS, AND JOINT MECHANOBIOLOGY, HAS LED TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ETIOLOGY AND SEX DISPARITY OF TMJ DISORDERS. SPECIFICALLY, SMALLER CONDYLES AND SHORTER MANDIBLES INCREASE FEMALE TMJ LOADS, CONTACT STRESSES AND ENERGY DENSITY, WHILE DECREASING BOTH TISSUE NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AND CELL VIABILITY, LEADING TO PATHOLOGICAL TMJ REMODELING. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO TAKE THIS SAME INTEGRATED APPROACH OF TMJ MORPHOLOGY, MECHANICS, AND MECHANOBIOLOGY BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF CLASS II AND III PHENOTYPES. OUR OVER-ARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MECHANICAL LOADING MAGNITUDE, AS WELL AS TISSUE NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AND CELL VIABILITY, OF THE TMJ ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN SKELETALLY MATURE INDIVIDUALS WITH CLASS I, II, AND III PHENOTYPES. MORE SPECIFICALLY WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE TMJ IN CLASS II FEMALES HAS THE HIGHEST MECHANICAL LOADING, LOWEST TISSUE NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, AND LOWEST CELL VIABILITY DUE TO DISPROPORTIONALLY SMALL CONDYLE AND SHORT MANDIBLE, AND THAT ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY CAN IMPROVE BOTH TMJ BIOMECHANICS AND MECHANOBIOLOGY, THUS GIVING MECHANISTIC INSIGHT.

THE LOCALIZED FORM OF THIS DISEASE, NOW TERMED STAGE 3-4 GRADE C, MOLAR-INCISOR PATTERN PERIODONTITIS (C/MIP), EXHIBITS A VERY WELL-DEFINED CLINICAL PRESENTATION. ALTHOUGH LESS COMMON THAN OTHER PERIODONTITIS, C/MIP HAS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT, AS IT AFFECTS SYSTEMICALLY HEALTHY, YOUNG INDIVIDUALS, OF LOW SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS, WHO USUALLY CANNOT AFFORD ITS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX TREATMENT, AS THEIR AFFECTED TEETH ARE OFTEN LOST DUE TO ITS RAPID PROGRESSION AND DELAYED DIAGNOSIS. THIS LEADS TO EARLY FUNCTION AND AESTHETICS ISSUES AND LIFE-LONG DIFFICULTIES FOR FUNCTIONAL AND AESTHETIC REHABILITATION. DUE ITS COMMON AGGREGATION IN FAMILIES, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SEARCHED FOR GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH GRADE C DISEASE, BUT NOT IN LARGE COHORTS OF C/MIP. THUS, GENETIC CONTRIBUTIONS FOR C/MIP ARE NOT YET IDENTIFIED. THE TEAM PUT TOGETHER FOR THIS PROPOSAL HAVE CONDUCTED GROUND- BREAKING WORK IN THIS FIELD OVER THE LAST 3 DECADES, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF CANDIDATE GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY VARIANTS, HYPER-INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE, AND STRONG ASSOCIATION WITH AA AND AA JP2 CLONE. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT POPULATIONS HAVE DIFFERENT GENETIC PREDISPOSITIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, AND MICROBIAL COLONIZATION, WHICH FURTHER COMPLICATES UNVEILING THE TRUE ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS OF THIS DISEASE. THUS, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO EXAMINE A LARGE WELL-DEFINED COHORT OF C/MIP FAMILIES FROM DIFFERENT WORLD REGIONS TO SYSTEMATICALLY AND COMPREHENSIVELY DETERMINE THE GENETIC, HOST RESPONSE, AND MICROBIAL DETERMINANTS OF THIS DISEASE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE GENETIC, HOST, AND MICROBIAL FACTORS OF THE EARLY ONSET, WELL-DEFINED, LOCALIZED FORM OF PERIODONTITIS IN POPULATIONS WORLDWIDE.

CO-OP CHICAGO WAS PREVIOUSLY FUNDED BY NIDCR TO REDUCE ORAL HEALTH DISPARITIES IN CHILDREN. THE ORIGINAL CO-OP CHICAGO STUDY [UH2DE02583] ESTABLISHED BASELINE ESTIMATES OF TOOTH BRUSHING BEHAVIORS AND DETERMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF TOOTH BRUSHING BEHAVIORS IN THE HOMES OF HIGH-RISK CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF THREE YEARS OLD. CO-OP CHICAGO [UH3DE025483] THEN RECRUITED 420 CHILD/CAREGIVER DYADS TO PARTICIPATE IN A TWO-ARM, CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A FAMILY-FOCUSED CHW ORAL HEALTH INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE TOOTH BRUSHING BEHAVIORS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS CAREGIVER-REPORTED BRUSHING FREQUENCY AND OBSERVED PLAQUE SCORE AT 12-MONTHS. AT ENTRY INTO THE STUDY, THE MEAN CHILD AGE WAS 21.5 MONTHS. FORTY-TWO PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS BLACK RACE, AND 54% AS HISPANIC ETHNICITY. MOST CHILDREN (89%) HAD MEDICAID HEALTH INSURANCE. CO-OP CHICAGO COLLECTED A RANGE OF SELF-REPORTED AND OBSERVED ORAL HEALTH DATA AS WELL AS FAMILY PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS FROM THESE LOW-INCOME FAMILIES OVER ONE YEAR. HOWEVER, THE STUDY DID NOT INCLUDE A CARIES ASSESSMENT. THE PROPOSED CO-OP CHICAGO COHORT STUDY WILL TRANSITION TRIAL PARTICIPANTS INTO A LONGITUDINAL COHORT (MINIMUM N=315) TO DETERMINE MULTI-LEVEL PREDICTORS OF ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND CARIES RISK IN LOW-INCOME, URBAN YOUNG CHILDREN OVER TIME. THE CO-OP CHICAGO COHORT STUDY USES THE SOCIAL ECOLOGIC MODEL TO ORGANIZE ORAL HEALTH RISK FACTORS INTO INDIVIDUAL (CHILD), INTERPERSONAL (FAMILY), ORGANIZATIONAL (HEALTHCARE), AND COMMUNITY DOMAINS. WE WILL COLLECT FOUR ADDITIONAL YEARS OF DATA WITH DATA COLLECTION EVERY SIX MONTHS THAT INCLUDES CAREGIVER-REPORTED AND OBSERVED CHILD ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS, DENTAL PLAQUE SCORES, DIET, PARENTING STYLES, DENTAL PROVIDER ACCESS, AND SOCIAL RISK FACTORS. WE WILL ALSO CONDUCT TWO CARIES EXAMINATIONS ON CHILDREN AT AGES FIVE AND SEVEN. COMMUNITY-LEVEL DATA WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM PUBLIC DATA SOURCES. SPECIFIC AIM 1 IS TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CHILD, FAMILY, HEALTHCARE, AND COMMUNITY FACTORS ON YOUNG CHILD HOME ORAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS (CHILD BRUSHING FREQUENCY AND PLAQUE SCORE) OVER TIME. SPECIFIC AIM 2 IS TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CHILD, FAMILY, HEALTHCARE, AND COMMUNITY FACTORS ON YOUNG CHILD CARIES PREVALENCE OVER TIME. SPECIFIC AIM 3 IS TO EXAMINE THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHILD BRUSHING FREQUENCY AND PLAQUE SCORE ON THE PRIOR IDENTIFIED RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CARIES PREVALENCE. AN EXPLORATORY AIM WILL DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF PLAQUE SCORES TO PREDICT RISK OF CARIES. THESE DATA WILL ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CARIES RISK FACTORS AND INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH AND INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "IL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "98f86457-cdff-6b3c-9ff8-3a4415183bf6-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_U01DE030067_7529"}, {"internal_id": 138797005, "Award ID": "U01DE030065", "Award Amount": 2162111.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-27", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN YOUNG CHILDREN WITH CLEFT PALATE - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT OROFACIAL CLEFTS ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMON CONGENITAL CONDITIONS IN THE U.S., OCCURRING IN APPROXIMATELY ONE IN EVERY 800 BIRTHS. CHILDREN WITH CLEFT PALATE WITH OR WITHOUT CLEFT LIP (CP\u00b1L) REQUIRE INTERDISCIPLINARY CARE FROM INFANCY THROUGH ADULTHOOD TO IMPROVE SPEECH, FACIAL APPEARANCE, AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH. CLEFT- RELATED TREATMENTS ARE BURDENSOME FOR AFFECTED CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES, AND LIFETIME HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE ESTIMATED AT NEARLY $700 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR CHILDREN CP\u00b1 L ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON CLINICAL EXPERTISE AND PROVIDE WIDE LATITUDE IN THE TYPES AND TIMING OF ASSESSMENTS AND INTERVENTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE AMERICAN CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFACIAL ASSOCIATION RECOMMENDS THAT ALL CLEFT TEAMS INCLUDE A PSYCHOSOCIAL PROFESSIONAL TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH, QUALITY OF LIFE, EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND SOCIAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN WITH CP\u00b1L, THE TYPES OF SERVICES VARY GREATLY ACROSS CENTERS. IN ADDITION, IT REMAINS UNKNOWN WHICH CHILDREN WITH CP\u00b1L ARE AT GREATEST RISK FOR POOR HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES AND WHICH DEMOGRAPHIC (E.G., RACE), MEDICAL (E.G., CLEFT TYPE, TIMING OF DIAGNOSIS) AND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS (E.G., CAREGIVER STRESS) CONTRIBUTE TO THESE RISKS. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE TO INFORM THE PROVISION OF TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT THE LONG-TERM MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN WITH CP\u00b1L AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THIS GAP BY PARTNERING WITH THE CLEFT PALATE REGISTRY/RESEARCH OUTCOMES NETWORK (CORNET; NIDCR R01DE02749). CORNET IS THE LARGEST U.S. PROSPECTIVE STUDY IN CLEFT CARE TO DATE AND FOCUSES ON SURGICAL AND SPEECH OUTCOMES (PRE-PALATE REPAIR THROUGH 3 YEARS OF AGE) IN A COHORT OF INFANTS (N = 1514) WITH CP\u00b1L ACROSS 16 GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE CLEFT CENTERS. LEVERAGING CORNET AND AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS WITH EXPERTISE IN CLEFT CARE OUTCOMES, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE PSYCHOSOCIAL AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IN YOUNG CHILDREN WITH CP\u00b1L AND THEIR CAREGIVERS THROUGH TWO NEW STUDIES: 1) A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY [N = 500] OF MEDICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS PREDICTIVE OF HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES; AND 2) A LONGITUDINAL, MIXED METHODS STUDY [N = 200] TO EVALUATE CONTEXTUAL PREDICTORS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL AND HEALTH OUTCOMES OVER TIME. SPECIFIC AIMS INCLUDE: 1) EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MEDICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND HEALTH (GROWTH/BMI) AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES (CHILD HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, ADJUSTMENT) IN CHILDREN AGES 2-5 YEARS ENROLLED IN CORNET; 2) PROSPECTIVELY ASSESS THE IMPACT OF CONTEXTUAL RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS ON HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES OVER TIME (AT BASELINE/PRE-PALATE SURGERY, 24 MONTHS, AND 36 MONTHS OF AGE); AND 3) QUALITATIVELY EVALUATE CAREGIVER PERCEPTIONS OF HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES AND TREATMENT EXPERIENCES OVER TIME THROUGH NARRATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH 40 CAREGIVERS. DATA FROM THIS STUDY WILL ELUCIDATE EARLY PREDICTORS OF POOR AND OPTIMAL OUTCOME TRAJECTORIES AND INFORM BOTH THE TYPE AND TIMING OF INTERVENTIONS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN BORN WITH CP\u00b1L

TRAINING OF PHD, DDS-PHD, AND POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLARS BY THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU) COLLEGE OF DENTISTRY (COD) ORAL BIOLOGY GRADUATE PROGRAM (OBGP) AND ITS PARTNER PROGRAMS IN THE OSU COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, THE BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE GRADUATE PROGRAM (BSGP) AND NEUROSCIENCE GRADUATE PROGRAM (NSGP). THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS INTEGRATED PRE-DOCTORAL AND POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING PROGRAM IS TO FOSTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE LEADERS IN DENTAL, ORAL, AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH WHO ARE SPECIFICALLY EQUIPPED TO EMPLOY MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH STRATEGIES IN BASIC, TRANSLATIONAL, AND CLINICAL SCIENCE, A HIGH-PRIORITY OBJECTIVE FOR THE NIDCR. WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS GOAL BY HARNESSING THE ENORMOUS INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY AND ASSEMBLING A COLLABORATIVE TEAM OF PRODUCTIVE AND DEDICATED MENTORS WHO BRING COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE TO THE PROGRAM. TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE: 1) PRE-DOCTORAL TRAINING IN THE OBGP PHD PROGRAM IN THE OSU COD AND TWO INTER-DISCIPLINARY GRADUATE PROGRAMS, THE BGSP AND NSGP, IN THE OSU COLLEGE OF MEDICINE; 2) DUAL DEGREE TRAINING FOR THE DDS/PHD DEGREES (DSTP); AND 3) POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING INCLUDING POST PHD AND CLINICIAN/SCIENTIST PROGRAMS. NATIONALLY RECRUITED TRAINEES WILL GAIN INVALUABLE TRAINING IN RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT THROUGH STRUCTURED PROGRAMS AND COURSES ON CROSS-CUTTING THEMES RANGING FROM MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY, INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNITY, BIG DATA INFORMATICS, AND CLINICAL ORAL HEALTH RESEARCH. IN ADDITION TO THE PRIMARY MENTOR AND A MENTORING TEAM, EACH TRAINEE\u2019S PROGRESS WILL BE MONITORED BY AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, AND THE GRADUATE STUDIES COMMITTEE FOR EACH GRADUATE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM WILL CAPITALIZE ON INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AT THE OSU COD FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF UNDER-REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, 36 TRAINEES HAVE MATRICULATED INTO THE PROGRAM AND HAVE BEEN MENTORED BY 14 DIFFERENT FACULTY MEMBERS. OUR PROUD TRAINING HISTORY CONFIRMS HIGH LEVEL MENTORING AND SUPPORT FOR TRAINEES THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE CAREER PIPELINE, INCLUDING DURING TRAINING (E.G. COMPETITIVE RESEARCH AWARDS AT IADR, AADOCR AND OTHER CONFERENCES; F30/31 GRANTS AWARDED), AT CRITICAL TRANSITION POINTS (E.G. POSTDOCTORAL, RESIDENCY, AND FACULTY POSITIONS ATTAINED), AND IN LONG-TERM BENCHMARKS (E.G. PROMOTION; INDEPENDENT FUNDING; AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION OF TRAINEE ACHIEVEMENTS). IN SUMMARY, THIS TRAINING PROGRAM OFFERS AN INNOVATIVE INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE CURRICULUM BASED ON THE MECHANISMS OF HUMAN DISEASE, AND AN EXTENSIVE AND FLEXIBLE CURRICULUM IN ORAL SCIENCES, COUPLED WITH THE LONG-TERM MENTORSHIP OF EXPERIENCED INTERDISCIPLINARY FACULTY.

NUCLEAR MAGNETIC SPECTROMETRY (NMR) AND INFRARED ABSORPTION (IR) ARE THE METHODS THAT CAN DIRECTLY PROBE WATER FROM BIOLOGICAL TISSUES. HOWEVER, THEIR PERFORMANCES ARE LIMITED BECAUSE NMR ONLY MEASURES THE AVERAGE EFFECT OF THE SAMPLE, WHILE IR REQUIRES SPECIAL PREPARATIONS TO TISSUES LIKE TEETH AND COULD ALTER THE PROPERTIES OF THE TISSUES. RECENTLY, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT FLUORESCENCE COMPRESSED RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY HAS THE CAPABILITY OF PROBING WATER IN DENTAL HARD TISSUES AND SHOWED THAT THE SPECTRAL PROFILES OF WATER ARE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN DENTIN AND ENAMEL. THE PROFILES VARIED EVEN WITHIN ENAMEL AT DIFFERENT TESTING SPOTS. THOSE RESULTS INDICATE THAT RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ROLE OF WATER IN DENTAL HARD TISSUES WITH DETAILS THAT MAY IMPACT THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS OF DENTAL PROBLEMS. THE MAJOR AIM OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO USE RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY TO IDENTIFY HOW THE CHANGES IN WATER CONTENT AND STRUCTURE IN DENTAL HARD TISSUES MAY CORRELATE WITH DENTAL TISSUE PATHOLOGIES.

WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE SYSTEM SENSITIVITY BY ONE ORDER OR MORE. AIM 2 WILL INVESTIGATE THE CHANGES IN WATER AMOUNT AND STRUCTURE CHANGES REFLECTED BY RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY AND IDENTIFY IF THESE CHANGES ARE CORRELATED WITH OTHER CHEMICAL/PHYSICAL CHANGES IN DENTAL HARD TISSUES. TEETH WITH VARIOUS DEGREES OF DEMINERALIZATION AND DECOMPOSING OF ORGANICS WILL BE PREPARED TO SHOW DEFERENT LEVELS OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONAL CHANGES. RAMAN SPECTRA WILL BE ACQUIRED FROM THESE SIMULATED SAMPLES AND USED AS REFERENCES FOR PROBING COMPOSITIONAL VARIATIONS IN TEETH WITH NATURALLY DEVELOPED CARIES.

AS A RESULT, THESE PATIENTS OFTEN NEED FEEDING TUBES WHICH INTERRUPTS THEIR CANCER TREATMENT. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN TO THE PATIENT IS STAGGERINGLY HIGH, COSTING AN ADDITIONAL $17,000 TO $40,000 FOR EACH PATIENT. PREVENTING ORAL MUCOSITIS WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE CANCER THERAPY AS WELL AS THE WELLNESS OF THE PATIENTS. GLYCOMIRA'S LEAD CANDIDATE, GM-1111, IS A NEW CLASS OF ANTI- INFLAMMATORY DRUGS THAT MODULATE AN OVERACTIVE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM WHEN ADMINISTERED VIA ONCE DAILY SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION. THE SBIR PHASE I AND II STUDY RESULTS DEMONSTRATE ITS POWERFUL EFFICACY IN REDUCING THE SEVERITY AND THE OCCURRENCE OF THE DISEASE IN RADIATION-INDUCED ORAL MUCOSITIS MODELS: GM-1111 REDUCED TISSUE ULCERATION AND INFLAMMATION IN THE TONGUE. HISTOLOGICALLY, ORAL TISSUES FROM THE GM-1111 TREATED GROUP SHOWED MARKEDLY REDUCED DAMAGES IN THE EPITHELIUM WITH MILD INFILTRATION OF LEUKOCYTES, THICKER MUCOSAL LAYERS AND PREVENTION OF MUCOUS GLANDULAR ALTERATIONS COMPARED TO THE TISSUES FROM VEHICLE TREATED CONTROLS. BIOCHEMICAL AND GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSES OF THE DISEASED TISSUES REVEALED INCREASED EXPRESSION OF TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS, NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME AS WELL AS THEIR DOWNSTREAM PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES ALL OF WHICH WERE REDUCED WITH GM-1111 TREATMENT. OVERALL, THE DATA SUGGEST THAT GM-1111 HAS SUBSTANTIAL POTENTIAL TO REDUCE ORAL MUCOSITIS IN HUMANS. GLYCOMIRA ALSO MANUFACTURED CGMP COMPLIANT GM-1111 AND GENERATED ITS MANUFACTURING SPECIFICATIONS. TO FURTHER DEVELOP A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE THERAPEUTIC FOR ORAL MUCOSITIS, WE PROPOSE STUDIES THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE INVESTIGATIVE NEW DRUG (IND) APPLICATION TO THE FDA FOR CLINICAL TRIALS. THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO (1) DELINEATE THE SAFETY PROFILES OF GM-1111 IN NONCLINICAL STUDIES AND (2) MANUFACTURE CLINICAL TRIAL READY STERILE DRUG PRODUCT (ASEPTIC FILL/FINISH AND LABELING/PACKAGING) AND TEST ITS STABILITY. THE RESULTS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL LEAD THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT TO THE CLINICAL STAGE THROUGH IND APPLICATION AND PROPEL THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE DRUG TO THE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "76bc8de1-f2ab-86f1-60e9-23b73086c763-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_SB1DE024024_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140657057, "Award ID": "S06GM142122", "Award Amount": 1952733.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-24", "CFDA Number": "93.859", "Description": "BUILDING CAPACITY FOR DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH IN A TRIBAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM - PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR ALASKA NATIVE AND AMERICAN INDIAN (ANAI) PEOPLE IS 10 YEARS SHORTER THAN NON- HISPANIC WHITES, AND ANAIS HAVE HIGHER DEATH RATES FROM CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, AND CANCER.

SJ\u00d6GREN\u2019S SYNDROME (SS) IS AN AUTOIMMUNE EXOCRINOPATHY AFFECTING THE SALIVARY GLANDS, LACRIMAL GLANDS, AND OTHER EXOCRINE ORGANS IN 0.4% OF THE US POPULATION, WITH MOST PATIENTS BEING WOMEN OVER 40 (9:1 FEMALE TO MALE RATIO). THE PRIMARY DEFICIT UNDERLYING SS IS THE LOSS OF FUNCTIONAL SECRETORY EPITHELIUM IN EXOCRINE GLANDS. THE MECHANISMS LEADING TO LOSS OF FUNCTION ARE COMPLEX AND MULTIFACTORIAL BUT INCLUDE BOTH IMMUNE-DEPENDENT AND IMMUNE-INDEPENDENT PATHOLOGIES THAT EXTEND TO NORMAL AGING AND RT. CELLULAR SENESCENCE IS AN IMPORTANT TUMOR- CONSTRAINING MECHANISM THAT HALTS CELLULAR PROLIFERATION AND HAS POSITIVE IMPACTS ON WOUND HEALING BUT, WHEN ACTIVATED CHRONICALLY, CAN EXACERBATE TISSUE INJURY AND LOSS OF FUNCTION. RECENT WORK DEMONSTRATED THAT SENESCENT CELLS ACCUMULATE IN THE SALIVARY GLANDS OF SS PATIENTS, BECAUSE OF RT, AND DURING NORMAL AGING. HOW CELLULAR SENESCENCE CONTRIBUTES TO SALIVARY HYPOFUNCTION IN SS AND OTHER CONDITIONS IS INCOMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD. SENESCENT CELLS THAT ACCUMULATE WITH AGE ADOPT A SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED SECRETORY PHENOTYPE (SASP) CHARACTERIZED BY THE SECRETION OF CYTOKINES, GROWTH FACTORS, AND PROTEASES THAT DISRUPT TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS AND CONTRIBUTE TO AGE-RELATED PATHOLOGIES. SASP IS CAUSALLY LINKED TO TISSUE DEGENERATION BY PARACRINE EFFECTS ON NEIGHBORING CELLS, AND GENETIC ABLATION OF SENESCENT CELLS CAN PRESERVE ORGAN FUNCTION BY LIMITING SASP. SIMILARLY, SENOLYTIC DRUGS THAT SYSTEMICALLY ABLATE SENESCENT CELLS CAN INCREASE GENERAL HEALTH AND LIFESPAN IN MICE. MINIMIZATION OF SASP MAY LIMIT THE AMPLITUDE AND DURATION OF THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE, RESTRICT THE LOSS OF EXOCRINE FUNCTION, AND DELAY DISEASE-RELATED ORGAN DECLINE. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL MICRORNAS THAT CONTROL SASP AND INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE GENE EXPRESSION THAT CAN BE USED AS TARGETS TO LIMIT THE ACTIVITY OF SENESCENT CELLS.

THROUGH THIS ORGANIZATION, CTCF MODULATES INTERACTIONS BETWEEN REGULATORY SEQUENCES AND THEIR COGNATE PROMOTERS. CONSEQUENTLY, DISRUPTION OF CTCF FUNCTION MAY LEAD TO ALTERATIONS OF GENE EXPRESSION DURING DEVELOPMENT AND DEFECTS IN CELL LINEAGE SPECIFICATION. THIS APPLICATION IS BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT FUNCTIONAL ANALYSES OF DIFFERENT CTCF MUTATIONS PRESENT IN PATIENTS WITH CRD WILL GIVE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE PATHOGENIC VARIANTS AFFECT GENE EXPRESSION DURING CELL DIFFERENTIATION, AND HOW THESE ALTERATIONS LEAD TO THE VARIETY OF PHENOTYPES OBSERVED IN CRD PATIENTS. CTCF VARIANTS FOUND IN THESE PATIENTS ARE LOCATED IN REGIONS OF THE PROTEIN IMPORTANT FOR DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CTCF FUNCTION. THIS INCLUDES DNA SEQUENCE RECOGNITION, AFFINITY FOR THE DNA BINDING MOTIF, INTERACTIONS WITH RNA TO STABILIZE BINDING AT A SUBSET OF GENOMIC SITES, NON-SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS WITH THE DNA PHOSPHATE BACKBONE THAT MAY AFFECT CTCF RESIDENCE TIME ON DNA, AND INTERACTIONS WITH COHESIN THAT MAY AFFECT LOOP FORMATION OR STABILITY. WE THEREFORE HYPOTHESIZE THAT VARIANTS AFFECTING THESE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ARE INVOLVED IN TARGETING CTCF TO SPECIFIC GENOMIC LOCATIONS OR ITS INTERACTION WITH COHESIN TO ELICIT DISTINCT ALTERED PATTERNS OF GENE EXPRESSION. THIS IN TURN MAY AFFECT CELL FUNCTION OR DIFFERENTIATION INTO SPECIFIC LINEAGES TO CAUSE VARIANT-SPECIFIC PHENOTYPES IN CRD PATIENTS. USING THESE MUTATIONS, WHICH AFFECT SINGLE AMINO ACIDS, WE THUS PROPOSE TO EXAMINE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN PATIENT PHENOTYPES AND DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CTCF FUNCTION. WE WILL USE PATIENT-DERIVED IPSCS, CEREBRAL ORGANOIDS, INDUCED NEURAL CREST CELLS (INCCS), AND SINGLE-CELL TECHNOLOGIES TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR PROCESSES ALTERED BY SPECIFIC CTCF VARIANTS IN THE BRAIN AND NEURAL CREST. WE WILL ALSO USE MOUSE MODELS CARRYING THE SAME MUTATIONS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF THESE CTCF VARIANTS ON BRAIN AND NEURAL CREST DEVELOPMENT IN VIVO AND COMPARE THESE RESULTS WITH THOSE OBTAINED USING INCCS AND CEREBRAL ORGANOIDS.

IN ADDITION, ORAL LESIONS IN THE CT IMAGES ARE FREQUENTLY OBSCURED BY METAL ARTIFACTS CAUSED BY DENTAL PROSTHESES, REDUCING THE SENSITIVITY AND INCREASING FALSE DIAGNOSIS. CT IS KNOWN TO HAVE A HIGH SPECIFICITY BUT LOW SENSITIVITY FOR DETECTION OF ORAL CANCERS.

IN ITS MOST TYPICAL FORM, IT CAUSES BRIEF ATTACKS OF INTENSE SHOCK-LIKE PAIN ON ONE SIDE OF THE FACE. ALTHOUGH IT IS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRIGEMINAL OR 5TH CRANIAL NERVE, ITS OVERALL ETIOLOGY REMAINS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. A MULTITUDE OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND SURGICAL METHODS HAVE BEEN USED TO TREAT TN, WITH VARYING LEVELS OF LONG-TERM EFFICACY, BUT TREATMENT REMAINS CHALLENGING GIVEN THAT TN PAIN MAY BE CAUSED BY ANY OF A MYRIAD OF UNDERLYING ABNORMALITIES THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE IDENTIFIABLE USING CURRENT CLINICAL WORKUPS. CLINICALLY, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) IS USED TO DETECT NEUROVASCULAR COMPRESSION (NVC), CONVENTIONALLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE A MAIN CAUSE OF TN, AND TO RULE OUT OTHER POTENTIAL ETIOLOGIES SUCH AS LESIONS OR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. HOWEVER, PAIN EVENTUALLY RECURS IN NEARLY HALF OF PATIENTS WHOSE NVC WAS TREATED SURGICALLY, AND NVC IS OFTEN IDENTIFIED IN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE TN. ALTHOUGH CURRENT MRI PROTOCOLS ARE IMPORTANT IN THE PRE-SURGICAL ASSESSMENT OF NVC, THEY LIKELY LACK THE RESOLUTION, QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY, AND SCOPE REQUIRED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY INTERROGATE THE ENTIRE TRIGEMINAL SENSORY PATHWAY, AS WELL AS THE BRAIN NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SENSATION, EVALUATION, AND MODULATION OF PAIN THAT MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO TN. THERE REMAINS A CRITICAL UNMET NEED TO COMPREHENSIVELY STUDY THE REGIONS AND NETWORKS IMPLICATED IN TN AND RELIABLY AND ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THE TRUE CAUSE OF PAIN IN TN PATIENTS.

CURRENTLY, THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THIS TWO-WAY RELATIONSHIP ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. PD IS AN INFLAMMATORY DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ALTERATIONS OF THE SUBGINGIVAL MICROBIOME.

HOWEVER, COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SUBGINGIVAL MICROBIOME AND ITS CHANGES UPON TREATMENT, AND THE ASSOCIATED FUNCTIONS INCLUDING HOST RESPONSES IN T2D WITH PD IS LACKING.

EXISTING GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES OF ECC ARE FEW AND PERFORMED SINGLE-LOCUS ASSOCIATION MAPPING USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION OF CARIES AFFECTION STATUS OR COUNT REGRESSION OF DMFS/DMFT/DFS/DFT. DRAWBACKS OF THOSE APPROACHES INCLUDE POTENTIAL MISSPECIFICATION OF AGE EFFECT, WEAK SIGNAL FROM SINGLE SNP, AND THE BURDEN OF MULTIPLE TESTING CORRECTION. THE FIRST DRAWBACK LEADS TO INCORRECT SIZES FOR THE MODEL-BASED ASSOCIATION TESTS. THE SECOND AND THIRD DRAWBACKS HINDER THE POWER OF THE ASSOCIATION MAPPING. MULTI-LOCUS TESTS WITH AGE TO ECC OR THE COUNTING PROCESS OF DMFS AS PHENOTYPE CAN ADDRESS THE FIRST AND SECOND DRAWBACKS AND ALLEVIATE THE THIRD ONE. PENALIZED VARIABLE SELECTION WITH AGE TO ECC AS PHENOTYPE CAN ADDRESS THE FIRST AND THIRD DRAWBACKS.

CISPLATIN IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED ANTI-CANCER DRUG FOR TREATMENT OF RECURRENT AND METASTATIC HNSCC, BUT THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WILL EVENTUALLY DEVELOP RESISTANCE TO THIS TREATMENT AND DIE WITHIN ONE YEAR. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT, YET STILL UNMET, NEED FOR IMPROVED THERAPIES FOR CISPLATIN- RESISTANT HNSCC. A MAJOR ADVANCEMENT IN THE TREATMENT OF ADVANCED HNSCC IN THE PAST 20 YEARS HAS BEEN THE USE OF THE FDA-APPROVED EGFR ANTIBODY, CETUXIMAB.

ABNORMAL ACTIVATION OF KEY SURVIVAL PATHWAYS THROUGH COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS OFTEN LEADS TO THERAPEUTIC FAILURE OF CISPLATIN AND EGFR INHIBITORS. A MOST IMPORTANT DOWNSTREAM TARGET OF EGFR IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER IS PI3K. EGFR AND OTHER RECEPTOR PROTEINS ACTIVATE PI3K (PI3KA, PI3KSS, PI3K, AND PI3KD), WHICH THEN INITIATE ACTIVATION OF AKT AND MTOR TO PROMOTE TUMOR GROWTH, METASTASIS, AND THERAPY RESISTANCE. IN FACT, PI3KA MUTATION AND AMPLIFICATION WAS FOUND IN MORE THAN 30% OF TUMORS IN PATIENTS. THEREFORE, PI3K/AKT/MTOR IS A MOST ATTRACTIVE THERAPEUTIC TARGET IN HNSCC. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH MANY PAN- AND ISOFORM-SPECIFIC PI3K INHIBITORS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, NONE HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE FOR THERAPEUTIC USE IN THE CLINICAL SETTING DUE TO POOR EFFECTIVE RESULTS AND INTOLERABLE TOXICITY CAUSED BY THE PAN-PI3K INHIBITORS.

RESEARCH HAS DOCUMENTED A HIGH INCIDENCE OF SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITIES (MOST NOTABLY LANGUAGE OR READING DEFICITS) AMONG THIS POPULATION. THESE DISABILITIES, WHILE NOT IN THE RANGE OF INTELLECTUAL DYSFUNCTION, DO RESULT IN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT PROBLEMS AND LOWER RATES OF COLLEGE ATTENDANCE. RECENT WORK HAS ALSO DOCUMENTED DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION AMONG PEOPLE WITH AN ISOLATED ORAL CLEFT THAT IS CORRELATED TO MEASURES OF COGNITIVE AND ACADEMIC FUNCTIONING. THESE DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED ACROSS CHILD, ADOLESCENT, YOUNG ADULT, AND ADULT SAMPLES. CURRENT THEORIES ON THE ETIOLOGY OF THESE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES HAVE PROPOSED: 1) EARLY EXPOSURE TO ANESTHESIA, 2) OBSTRUCTED AIRWAY AND RESULTING REDUCED OXYGENATION, AND 3) ABNORMAL NEURAL MIGRATION AS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.

NEW EFFICACIOUS, AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGIES CAPABLE OF PRECISELY TARGETING COMPLEX ANATOMICAL AREAS ARE NEEDED TO KILL BACTERIA AS WELL AS DEGRADE AND REMOVE BIOFILM STRUCTURE. WE PROPOSE A NOVEL APPROACH THAT COMBINES NANOTECHNOLOGY AND ROBOTICS TO DEVELOP THE FIRST AUTOMATED BIOFILM ERADICATION PLATFORM.

IN SUCH SITUATIONS, VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (VEGF) IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE FACTOR THAT CAN REESTABLISH THE OXYGEN SUPPLY TO TISSUES.

ALTHOUGH THE MECHANICAL STRENGTH OF REBARS IS THE PROPERTY THAT MAKES THE SCAFFOLD APPROPRIATE FOR CRITICAL-SIZED DEFECTS, ANOTHER FUNCTIONALITY OF THE REBAR, WHICH IS ITS SLOW DEGRADABILITY (6 MONTHS), MAKES THE DESIGN A PERFECT CHOICE FOR THE VEGF DELIVERY PURPOSE. REBARS WILL PROVIDE US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMMOBILIZE VEGF-LOADED PARTICLES ON A SOLID SURFACE AND NOT LET THE PARTICLES MOVE ELSEWHERE.

THAT AFFECTS ~200 MILLION HUMANS WORLDWIDE AND IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT ESTHETIC, FUNCTIONAL, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND FINANCIAL BURDENS FOR AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS. DESPITE RESEARCH PROGRESS, MUTATIONS IN KNOWN TA GENES ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN 50% OF ALL CASES, SUGGESTING THAT ADDITIONAL CAUSAL GENES REMAIN TO BE FOUND. GENOME-WIDE STUDIES OF TA ARE SCARCE AND, IN ADDITION, INTERPRETATION OF IDENTIFIED VARIANTS HAS BEEN CHALLENGING DUE TO THE PAUCITY OF STUDIES COMBINING GENE DISCOVERY WITH FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC APPROACHES. THIS COMPLICATES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF TA GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS AND FURTHER LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE DIAGNOSTIC AND TOOTH REPLACEMENT THERAPIES. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL IDENTIFY AND FUNCTIONALLY CHARACTERIZE THE UNDERLYING GENETIC VARIATIONS IN FAMILIAL AND SPORADIC TA TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS INVOLVED IN THE CONDITION. TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL, WE WILL: (1) PERFORM WHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING (WES) OF 450 INDIVIDUALS FROM OUR WELL-CHARACTERIZED TA FAMILIES AND CASE-CONTROL COHORT, AND APPLY ROBUST BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS INTEGRATING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA TO IDENTIFY PUTATIVE CAUSAL VARIANTS, (2) CHARACTERIZE PRIORITIZED VARIANTS USING FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC APPROACHES IN VITRO, AND (3) APPLY A PHEWAS APPROACH (PHENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDY) TO DETERMINE THE BROADER CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF TA GENES BY LINKING TA GENETIC VARIANTS WITH ADDITIONAL HEALTH OUTCOMES CAPTURED THROUGH A LARGE DNA DATABANK (BIOVU BIOBANK). THIS STUDY COMBINES GENOME-WIDE DISCOVERY WITH BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTATION, AND LEVERAGES EXISTING RESOURCES (DNA SAMPLES, GENETIC AND PHENOTYPIC DATA FROM BIOVU, ESTABLISHED IN VITRO MODEL) WITHIN A MULTI-PRONGED FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY NOVEL TA GENES/PATHWAYS. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY IS NOT ONLY INNOVATIVE IN ITS APPROACH, BUT IN ITS CAPACITY TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL TA CANDIDATE GENE STUDIES. WE HAVE EXCITING PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED DATA IN SUPPORT OF THESE PROPOSED STUDIES THAT WILL GREATLY ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING TA AND PROVIDE THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PATIENT-CENTERED DIAGNOSTIC AND FUTURE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH ON TOOTH REPLACEMENT THERAPIES.

TREATMENT TYPICALLY INVOLVES THE REMOVAL OF DECAYED TOOTH STRUCTURE AND PLACEMENT OF A NEW RESTORATION. SINCE THE MICROBIAL ENVIRONMENT REMAINS THE SAME, THE NEW TOOTH-RESTORATION COMPLEX MAY ALSO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FAILURE. THUS, THE PROBLEM IS NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED IN CURRENT DENTAL TREATMENT APPROACHES. MORE INNOVATIVE MATERIALS ARE REQUIRED THAT CAN PURPOSEFULLY BIAS THE MICROBIAL ENVIRONMENT TOWARD IMPROVED HEALTH. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT MG2+ OR ZN2+ RELEASED FROM BIOACTIVE GLASS (BAG)-CONTAINING RESIN COMPOSITES CAN SUPPORT A HEALTHY MICROBIAL ENVIRONMENT, THUS DIRECTLY ADDRESSING THE ROOT OF THE CARIES PROBLEM. HERE WE PROPOSE A NEW STRATEGY INVOLVING MG2+-AND ZN2+-RELEASING DENTAL COMPOSITES THAT CAN FAVORABLY ALTER THE MICROBIOME ON AND AROUND DENTAL RESTORATIONS SUCH THAT THE LOCAL PH >5.5. AIM 1: OPTIMIZE MG2+- AND ZN2+-RELEASING BIOACTIVE GLASS (BAG)-CONTAINING DENTAL COMPOSITES FOR LONG-TERM SUPPORT OF A HEALTHY ORAL MICROBIOME. SCANNING ELECTROCHEMICAL MICROSCOPY (SECM) WILL BE USED TO OPTIMIZE PH DEPENDENT MG2+ AND ZN2+ RELEASE KINETICS FROM DIFFERENT MG- AND ZN-BAG FORMULATIONS. LATER, DENTAL PLAQUE DERIVED MULTI SPECIES BIOFILM GROWTH RATE, VOLUME, SPECIES COMPOSITION AND PH AT THE BAG SURFACE WILL BE QUANTIFIED AND OPTIMIZED SUCH THAT LOCAL PH > 5.5. AIM 2: TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NEW MG-BAG AND ZN-BAG COMPOSITES IN AN IN VITRO SECONDARY CARIES MODEL. PLACEMENT OF A RESTORATION HAS THE INHERENT CHALLENGE OF GAP FORMATION BETWEEN THE DENTAL MATERIAL AND THE TOOTH STRUCTURE. CURRENTLY, LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON HOW BACTERIA BEHAVE IN MICROGAPS. FOR EXAMPLE, MICROBIAL COLONIZATION, DIFFUSION RATES, AND ORGANIC ACID METABOLITES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT WITHIN GAPS AS COMPARED TO EXPOSED SURFACES IN THE ORAL CAVITY, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO ENHANCED TOOTH DECAY AT THE INTERFACE. HERE WE WILL DEVELOP AN IN VITRO MICROGAP MODEL USING THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSORS TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND THE EFFECT ON THE MICROBIAL POPULATION IN THESE MICROENVIRONMENTS SUCH THAT LOCAL PH > 5.5. AIM 3: IN VIVO EVALUATION OF MG-BAG AND ZN-BAG COMPOSITES WITH INTRAORAL APPLIANCES. THE CYTOTOXICITY OF MG-BAG AND ZN-BAG WILL BE TESTED USING UNDIFFERENTIATED DENTAL PULP CELLS COMPARED TO STANDARD DENTAL COMPOSITES. THE IN VITRO OPTIMIZED MG-BAG AND ZN-BAG COMPOSITES THAT ARE SHOWN TO HAVE EQUAL OR LOWER CYTOTOXICITY THAN TYPICAL COMPOSITE WILL BE PLACED IN INTRAORAL APPLIANCES TO BE TESTED IN VOLUNTEERS.

TO BIOENGINEER ENAMEL, A NONREGENERATIVE TISSUE, WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF AMELOBLASTS. TO DATE, UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIQUE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF AMELOBLASTS HAS BEEN LIMITED DUE TO A LOSS OF AMELOBLASTS AFTER THE TOOTH ERUPTION AND A LACK OF CELL LINE FULLY RECAPITULATING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AMELOBLASTS. PREVIOUS FUNDING ALLOWS US TO ESTABLISH A NOVEL AND COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF GENES SIGNIFICANT TO EACH DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE OF AMELOBLASTS ACROSS SPECIES AND TO EXPLORE THE FUNCTIONS OF CHROMATIN ORGANIZER SATB1, PEPTIDASE KLK4, AND THE MAJOR CALCIUM TRANSPORTER NCKX4 IN THE CONTEXT OF AMELOBLAST DIFFERENTIATION. THESE EFFORTS RESULTED IN A DISCOVERY THAT ALL SATB1, KLK4, AND NCKX4 CONTRIBUTE TO THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF AMELOBLASTIN (AMBN) AND ENAMELIN (ENAM), ENCODING THE MAJOR EMPS CO-UPREGULATED IN SABS AND THEN CO-DOWNREGULATED IN MABS.

IN THE ABSENCE OF AMELOBLASTIN ENAMEL IS HYPOPLASTIC, KNOWN AS AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA. WHEN AMELOBLASTIN IS EXPRESSED TOO MUCH, THE ENAMEL DISPLAYS DEMARCATED, HYPOMINERALIZED LESIONS IN MICE. THE PATHOETIOLOGY OF MIH IS UNKNOWN. EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS ARE CURRENTLY DISCUSSED. THE ENAMEL OF MIH TEETH IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN IMBALANCE OF ENAMEL PROTEINS AND ENZYMES DEGRADING THE M ATRIX. THE HYPOTHESIS OF THIS RESEARCH IS THAT AMELOBLASTIN OVEREXPRESSION CAUSES DEMARCATED AND HYPOMINERALIZED LESIONS THROUGH ENZYMATIC IMBALANCE. THE PROPOSED AIMS WILL DEFINE THE PATHWAYS OF DEMARCATED ENAMEL HYPOMINERALIZATION CAUSED BY AMBN OVEREXPRESSION AND INSUFFICIENT ENZYME. IN SA1 WE WILL DETERMINE IF DEMARCATED, HYPOMINERALIZED LESIONS ARE CAUSED BY INSUFFICIENT ENZYME RELATIVE TO AMELOBLASTIN OVEREXPRESSION. IN SA2, WE WILL DETERMINE THE TRANSCRIPTOME AND TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF AMBN AND OVEREXPRESSED AMBN IN AMELOBLASTS USING CULTURED PRIMARY ENAMEL ORGAN EPITHELIUM, TERMED \u2018AMELOBLASTOIDS\u2019. IN SA3, FINDINGS FROM THE MOUSE MODEL WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO A MINIMALLY INVASIVE MIH TREATMENT PROTOCOL ADDRESSING CONDITIONING AND INFILTRATING THE POROUS, HYPOMINERALIZED ENAMEL.

SJS IMPACTS SEVERAL MILLION PEOPLE ANNUALLY IN THE US WITH WOMEN BEING NINE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED THAN MEN. TO DATE, NO VACCINES OR THERAPEUTICS EXIST TO CURE SJS, AND PATIENTS ARE DEPENDENT ON LIFELONG THERAPIES FOCUSED ON TREATING ONLY THEIR SYMPTOMS. OUR PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN COLONIZATION FACTOR ANTIGEN I (CFA/I) FIMBRIAE FROM ENTEROTOXIGENIC E. COLI ARE APPLIED EITHER NASALLY OR ORALLY, RESOLUTION OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES IS OBSERVED. TO ENABLE TESTING IN HUMANS, A PROBIOTIC APPROACH IS EXPLOITED, WHEREBY THE CFAI OPERON WAS OPTIMIZED FOR EXPRESSION BY LACTOCOCCUS LACTIS (LL-CFA/I). IN THE PREVIOUS FUNDING CYCLE, WE DEMONSTRATED LL-CFA/I'S ABILITY TO RESTORE SALIVARY FLOW IN A GENETICALLY DEFINED MODEL FOR SJS, C57BL/6.NOD-AEC1AEC2 MICE. CURRENT WORK SEEKS TO IMPROVE LL-CFA/I'S ACTIVITY AND STABILITY BY GENERATING A LL CONSTRUCT BEARING THE OPTIMIZED CFAI OPERON INSERTED INTO THE LL CHROMOSOME, REFERRED TO AS, LL 301. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MODE OF ACTION OF LL-CFA/I, THE TIP PROTEIN FROM CFA/I FIMBRIAE, CFAE, WAS EPISOMALLY EXPRESSED BY LL, AND FOUND TO EXHIBIT POTENT IMMUNE REGULATION OF EXPERIMENTAL RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. THESE FIMBRIAL PROTEINS ARE PRESUMED TO ACT BY INDUCING INFECTIOUS TOLERANCE, RESULTING IN THE STIMULATION OF ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC REGULATORY T CELLS (TREGS) AND REGULATORY B CELLS (BREGS) PRODUCING IL-10 AND TGF-B. SUCH BYSTANDER IMMUNITY DOES NOT RENDER GLOBAL IMMUNOSUPPRESSION, AND THUS, THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE CAPACITY REMAINS INTACT.

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE ANTI-CORROSIVE, ANTI-BACTERIAL AND BONE INTEGRATION PROPERTIES OF DENTAL IMPLANTS WITH A PIONEERING DESIGN THAT WILL INCORPORATE NANOSTRUCTURED TOPOGRAPHY AND PROTECTIVE COATINGS, WHICH WE DEVELOPED IN THE PREVIOUS FUNDING CYCLE, USING A RAT MODEL THAT WILL PHYSIOLOGICALLY SIMULATE THE ETIOLOGY OF PERI-IMPLANTITIS.  THIS UNIQUE, TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECT WILL EMPLOY THE USE OF A RAT MODEL WITH PHYSIOLOGICALLY INDUCED BACTERIAL-MEDIATED PERI-IMPLANTITIS. A COMBINATION OF NANOSTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY THROUGH ANODIZATION OF THE TITANIUM SURFACE, CUSTOMIZED FOR OSTEOFUNCTIONAL AND ANTI-BACTERIAL EFFICACY, WILL BE APPLIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROTECTIVE COATINGS (SILICON CARBIDE AND QUATERNIZED SILICON CARBIDE) DEVELOPED DURING THE LAST FUNDING CYCLE. THIS COMBINATION IS EXPECTED TO POTENTIATE THE OSSEOINTEGRATIVE, ANTI-BACTERIAL AND ANTI-CORROSIVE PROPERTIES OF BOTH SURFACE MODIFICATIONS TO CREATE A PREDICTABLE IMPLANT RESTORATION. INITIAL IN VITRO EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE IDEAL NANOSTRUCTURE SURFACE FOR OSSEOINTEGRATION. WE WILL COAT THESE CUSTOMIZED NANOSTRUCTURES TO DEVELOP A NEW IMPLANT DESIGN FOR PLACEMENT IN ANIMAL MODELS TO DETERMINE OSSEOINTEGRATION, ANTI-BACTERIAL AND ANTI-CORROSIVE PROPERTIES USING STATE OF THE ART NANOCT VISUALIZATION OF THE IN VIVO PATHOGENESIS OF PERI-IMPLANTITIS. WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING AIMS TO TEST OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS: AIM 1: TO OPTIMIZE NANOSTRUCTURE DESIGN FOR INCREASING OSSEOINTEGRATIVE POTENTIAL ON TI SURFACES IN VITRO; AIM 2: TO OPTIMIZE THE EFFECT OF CUSTOMIZED NANOSTRUCTURED COATED IMPLANT SURFACES ON BACTERIAL ADHESION AND PROLIFERATION, AND CORROSION IN VITRO; AIM 3: TO DETERMINE IN VIVO THE RATE AND AMOUNT OF OSSEOINTEGRATION IN IMPLANTS WITH CUSTOMIZED NANOSTRUCTURE TOPOGRAPHY DURING EARLY AND LATE STAGE IMPLANT PLACEMENT IN RABBITS USING STABILITY EVALUATION, NANO-CT EVALUATION AND HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS; AIM 4: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CUSTOMIZED NANOSTRUCTURED COATED IMPLANTS IN OSSEOINTEGRATION AND PREVENTION OF PERI-IMPLANTITIS IN VIVO IN THE RAT MODEL OF POLYMICROBIAL PERI- IMPLANTITIS, WHICH PHYSIOLOGICALLY MIMICS HUMAN PERI-IMPLANTITIS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "369ac1e4-8d93-3063-b933-3586dffba549-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DE025001_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49826039, "Award ID": "R56DE025000", "Award Amount": 376625.0, "Award Type": "COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2015-08-06", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "ORAL-FACIAL CLEFTS: DISCOVERY AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NEW GENES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "8a022699-f7be-356a-f01a-3aa6f76016ef-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R56DE025000_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151589496, "Award ID": "R56DE024796", "Award Amount": 402000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-01", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF SERUM AMYLOID A IN PERIAPICAL INFLAMMATION (R01 RENEW) - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF OUR SERUM AMYLOID A (SAA) PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE CELLULAR/MOLECULAR NETWORKS THAT REGULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFECTION-INDUCED DENTAL INFLAMMATION/BONE DESTRUCTION IN THE OVER BODY FAT STATUS. THIS RENEWAL APPLICATION SEEKS TO TEST A NEW PATHOLOGICAL PARADIGM THAT SAA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OBESITY AND ITS ASSOCIATED INFLAMMATIONS VIA ALTERING THE NATURAL ANTIBODY (NAB) PROFILE IN A HIGH-FAT DIET (HFD) ENVIRONMENT. OBESITY IS A GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERN. OBESITY EXACERBATES PERIAPICAL PERIODONTITIS (PERIAPICAL LESIONS), LEADING TO A POOR SUCCESS RATE OF TREATMENT. YET, UNDERSTANDING OF THE DETAILED PATHOGENESIS OF PERIAPICAL LESIONS IN OBESE HOSTS IS STILL INSUFFICIENT. SAA IS INDUCIBLE IN SUCH AS THE LIVER, ADIPOSE TISSUE, AND MACROPHAGES CAUSED BY INFLAMMATION INCLUDING PERIAPICAL LESIONS AND OBESITY. NAB ARE HETEROGENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULINS SECRETED BY B-1 B CELLS IN THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR ANTIGENIC EXPERIENCE (E.G. INFECTION). NAB PROVIDES IMMEDIATE AND NON-SPECIFIC PROTECTION AGAINST INFECTION DURING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY OVER SOME TIME PERIOD. ALSO, NAB IS IMPORTANT IN THE CLEARANCE OF DAMAGED/APOPTOTIC CELLS. IN OPPOSITE, ANTIGENS COMPLEXED WITH NAB (IMMUNE COM- PLEXES) MAY CAUSE TISSUE INJURY VIA COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION AND NEUTROPHIL-DEPENDENT INFLAMMATION. WE HAVE REPORTED THAT, UNDER NORMAL BODY FAT STATUS, SAA PLAYS A CYTOKINE-LIKE ROLE IN THE INDUCTION OF CHEMO- TAXIS, ACTIVATION OF THE TLR-NF-KB AXIS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHRONIC PERIAPICAL INFLAMMATION, BUT NOT IN BONE DESTRUCTION. NEXT, WE EXAMINED THE ROLE OF SAA IN PERIAPICAL LESIONS IN HFD-INDUCED OBESITY. OBESE WILD-TYPE (WT) MICE GAINED >75% LARGER LESION SIZE VS. LEAN CONTROLS. BY CONTRAST, HFD-FED SAA-BLOCKED MICE WERE RE- SISTANT TO BOTH OBESITY AND PERIAPICAL INFLAMMATION, RESULTED IN NO BODY WEIGHT GAIN AND ALMOST NO PERIAPICAL LESIONS. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE GENE EXPRESSION PROFILE OF COMPLEMENT AND IMMUNOGLOBULIN VARIABLE GENES. NON-INFECTED OBESE-WT MICE HAD A NAB PROFILE CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH TITER OF IGG1 REACTIVE WITH HUMAN ENDODONTIC PATHOGENS, WHILE HFD-FED SAA-BLOCKED MICE SHOWED A HIGH TITER OF NATURAL POLYREACTIVE IGM. SAA PROBABLY PLAYS A HITHERTO UNKNOWN HFD-DEPENDENT ROLE IN NATURAL ANTIBODY RESPONSE. AS COMPLEMENT GENES WERE LOCALLY EXPRESSED IN OBESE-WT LESIONS, SAA MAY BRING CAUSAL FACTORS FOR IGG IMMUNE COMPLEX INJURY ONLY TO WT MICE IN A HFD ENVIRONMENT. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT SAA PLAYS A UNIQUE HFD-DEPENDENT PATHOLOGIC ROLE IN PROMOTION OF PERIAPICAL INFLAMMATION AND OBESITY VIA CHANGING OF NAB PROFILE. WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SAA ON THE ROLE OF NAB IN A HFD ENVIRONMENT. AIM 2. TO EXAMINE WHETHER SAA LEADS TO IGG IMMUNE COMPLEX PERIAPICAL INJURY IN A HFD ENVIRONMENT. AIM 3. TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF PASSIVE NAB TRANSFER ON THE DISEASE DEVELOPMENT.

AT THE SITE OF INJURY, THESE MSCS DIFFERENTIATE AND GIVE RISE TO CELLS SECRETING REPARATIVE DENTIN, ALSO CALLED OSTEODENTIN. REPARATIVE DENTIN IS A THIN BAND OF POORLY ORGANIZED MINERALIZED TISSUE CONTAINING A MIXTURE OF NON-COLUMNAR ODONTOBLAST-LIKE AND OSTEOBLAST-LIKE CELLS. ALTHOUGH THE REPARATIVE DENTIN/OSTEO-DENTIN PROVIDES AN IMPERMEABLE HARD-TISSUE BARRIER TO THE DENTAL PULP, ITS HISTOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTIC IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM PHYSIOLOGICAL DENTIN AND CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A TRUE REGENERATION OF TUBULAR DENTIN DEVOID OF OSTEOBLASTS.

MANY AI CASES ARE ISOLATED (ONLY EXHIBIT ENAMEL DEFECTS). OTHERS ARE SYNDROMIC. THE SYNDROMES CAN INVOLVE VERY SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, INCLUDING BLINDNESS, KIDNEY CALCIFICATIONS, IMMUNODEFICIENCY, SKIN FRAGILITY, EPILEPSY, ETC. PRIMARY TEETH START TO ERUPT AT 6 MONTHS SO ENAMEL DEFECTS ARE OFTEN AN EARLY SIGN OF A LARGER DISEASE, AND THE ONLY APPARENT PHENOTYPE AT THE TIME OF DIAGNOSIS. AS SOME SYSTEMIC CONDITIONS CAN BE MITIGATED BY EARLY MEDICAL INTERVENTION, AN EARLY AND ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS CAN MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF THE CONDITION ON THE PATIENT'S HEALTH. WITHOUT AN ACCURATE GENETIC DIAGNOSIS, EARLY INTERVENTION TO MITIGATE PENDING SYSTEMIC DETERIORATION CANNOT BE EMPLOYED. A BARRIER TO MAKING A GENETIC DIAGNOSIS OF AI CONDITIONS IS INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GENES AND MUTATIONS THAT CAN CAUSE ISOLATED AND SYNDROMIC FORMS OF AI. THIS BARRIER IS ADDRESSED IN SA1: TO RECRUIT AND CHARACTERIZE AI FAMILIES TO DETERMINE THEIR GENETIC ETIOLOGY, IDENTIFY NEW CAUSATIVE GENES AND MUTATIONS, AND FACILITATE GENETIC TESTING.

WES ANALYSES COVER ABOUT 85% OF ALL DISEASE-CAUSING MUTATIONS.

FOLLOWING TOOTH LOSS, THE ALVEOLAR PORTION OF THE JAW WILL ATROPHY IN A PROCESS KNOWN AS RESIDUAL RIDGE RESORPTION. WHILE DENTAL IMPLANT-SUPPORTED CROWNS HAVE BECOME THE STANDARD OF CARE, MARKET RESEARCH INDICATES THAT 70% OF PATIENTS MUST UNDERGO A RIDGE AUGMENTATION PROCEDURE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE BONY STRUCTURE TO ACCEPT IMPLANT PLACEMENT. THE MARKET FOR BONE GRAFTS IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, INDICATING THAT THE IDEAL MATERIAL MEETING USER NEEDS DOES NOT EXIST. MOST DENTISTS REMAIN DISSATISFIED WITH EXISTING BONE GRAFTS DUE TO THEIR CHALLENGING HANDLING PROPERTIES AND POOR PREDICTABILITY. DUE TO THE LACK OF STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY, THEY TYPICALLY REQUIRE EXTRA COSTS AND STEPS TO PLACE ANCILLARY CONTAINMENT DEVICES TO PREVENT GRAFT MIGRATION AND FIBROUS TISSUE INGROWTH THAT IMPEDES BONE REGENERATION. AS A RESULT, A SECONDARY AUGMENTATION PROCEDURE IS REQUIRED IN 30% OF CASES TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT VOLUME FOR IMPLANT PLACEMENT. REVBIO, INC.

DELAYS IN DIAGNOSIS LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EARLY, LESS INVASIVE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. IN THIS FAST-TRACK SBIR PROJECT, PEDIAMETRIX INC. HAS JOINED FORCES WITH PEDIATRIC HOSPITALS AND PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE SOFTSPOTTM, WHICH IS THE FIRST MOBILE DIGITAL TOOL FOR 3D DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF INFANT CRANIAL MALFORMATIONS AT THE POINT-OF-CARE.  HEAD MALFORMATIONS DURING INFANCY CAN BE SYNOSTOTIC (I.E., CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS) OR NONSYNOSTOTIC (SUCH AS DEFORMATIONAL PLAGIOCEPHALY AND BRACHYCEPHALY OR DPB). BOTH TYPES OF CONDITIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND BENEFIT FROM EARLY TREATMENT TO AVOID LONG-TERM HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. THE PREVALENCE OF DPB INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS, FROM 5% TO APPROXIMATELY 20%-30%, CAUSING THE CONDITION TO BE CALLED A PEDIATRIC EPIDEMIC. CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS IS LESS COMMON AFFECTING 1 IN 2,000 CHILDREN. TO IMPROVE THE EARLY MANAGEMENT OF THESE CONDITIONS AND TO PREVENT MORE COMPLEX TREATMENT AND ASSOCIATED MORBIDITIES, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO MONITOR THE GROWTH OF THE INFANT HEAD AT THE POINT-OF-CARE.

UNINTENDED NERVE INJURY IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF MORBIDITY FOR MANY SURGERIES, ESPECIALLY IN SOFT TISSUE ORTHOPEDIC, OTOLARYNGOLOGY, CRANIOFACIAL, AND GENITOURINARY OPERATIONS. DISTINCTIVE VISUALIZATION OF NERVES FROM ADJACENT CONNECTIVE AND FAT TISSUES IS CHALLENGING, AND THEREFORE NERVE INJURY REMAINS A MAJOR SURGICAL COMPLICATION. FLUORESCENCE GUIDED SURGERY (FGS) BASED ON NERVE-LABELLING AGENTS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE NERVE IDENTIFICATION.

APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION PATIENTS UNDERGO SURGICAL TOOTH EXTRACTION IN THE U.S. EACH YEAR, MANY OF WHOM ARE ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS WITH NO PRIOR EXPOSURE TO OPIOID MEDICATIONS, AND MOST AT RISK FOR OPIOID ABUSE OR MISUSE. TO MEET THIS MEDICAL AND SOCIETAL NEED FOR NOVEL, NON-ADDICTIVE MEDICATIONS TO MANAGE AND TREAT ACUTE DENTAL PAIN, WE DEVELOPED LBB-111. LBB-111 IS A PROPRIETARY RESORBABLE EMULSION OF THREE ANESTHETIC DRUGS THAT IS ADMINISTERED, DURING TOOTH EXTRACTION, DIRECTLY TO THE EXTRACTION SOCKET, WHERE IT DELIVERS SUSTAINED, POST-OPERATIVE PAIN RELIEF FOR FOUR TO SEVEN DAYS POST-SURGERY. THE PRELIMINARY SAFETY, STABILITY, AND PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF LBB-111 WERE DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I. THE OBJECTIVES OF PHASE II ARE TO COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG (IND)-ENABLING STUDIES OF LBB-111, INCLUDING ESTABLISHING MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY CONTROL PROCESSES (AIM 1), AND IN VIVO TOXICOLOGY STUDIES IN A BEAGLE ANIMAL MODEL (AIM 2). THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE AIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL ADVANCE LBB-111 TOWARDS IND SUBMISSION, AND FIRST IN HUMAN STUDIES. FUTURE FDA APPROVAL AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF LBB-111 WILL ACCELERATE ITS IMPLEMENTATION AS PART OF A MULTI-MODAL CARE STRATEGY IN DENTAL AND ORAL SURGERY PRACTICES, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE, OR COMPLETELY ELIMINATE, THE PRACTICE OF PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS FOR THIRD MOLAR EXTRACTIONS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "1d07d8dd-8ed7-6116-3942-199fde27e295-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44DE028208_7529"}, {"internal_id": 85590917, "Award ID": "R44DE027903", "Award Amount": 1475659.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-09-16", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "BIORESORBABLE NANOPARTICLES FOR VISUAL DETECTION OF EARLY-STAGE DENTAL CARIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "683f8c5c-3b38-c415-942a-1919a152bb62-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44DE027903_7529"}, {"internal_id": 80726169, "Award ID": "R44DE027595", "Award Amount": 1477425.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2019-05-17", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "NIH HIGH-FIDELITY VIRTUAL REALITY TRAINER FOR ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY - PHASE II", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NC", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "0a6f32c4-aa98-e7b4-22a9-7dbf4f664425-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R44DE027595_7529"}, {"internal_id": 140658401, "Award ID": "R44DE027574", "Award Amount": 1700283.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-21", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "AUTOMATED DENTAL FRACTURE DETECTION USING HIGH RESOLUTION CBCT AND ADVANCED IMAGE ANALYSIS - PROJECT SUMMARY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT CRACKED TEETH ARE THE THIRD MOST COMMON CAUSE OF TOOTH LOSS IN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES. HISTOLOGICAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT ALL CRACKS ARE COLONIZED BY BACTERIA, WHICH HAVE  THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE INTENSELY PAINFUL PULPAL AND PERIAPICAL INFECTIONS. THE EARLY DETECTION OF CRACKS (INCOMPLETE FRACTURES) FOLLOWED BY APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT CRACK PROPAGATION ARE EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO PREVENT  INFECTIONS AND AVERT TOOTH LOSS. CURRENT TOOLS USED TO DIAGNOSE CRACKS ARE INADEQUATE AND THERE IS AN IMPERATIVE NEED TO DEVELOP AN OBJECTIVE AND RELIABLE METHOD TO DETECT CRACKS. DURING OUR PHASE I PROJECT, WE DEVELOPED  AND TESTED A NOVEL ALGORITHM FOR CRACK DETECTION ON EXTRACTED HUMAN TEETH. USING MACHINE LEARNING AND IMAGING  FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) WAVELETS, WE DEMONSTRATED ENHANCED CRACK DETECTION HR-CBCT. WE NOW PROPOSE TO FURTHER REFINE THIS TECHNOLOGY AND TO VALIDATE IT CLINICALLY. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT OUR METHOD  INCREASES THE PREDICTIVE VALIDITY OF HR-CBCT IN DETECTING CRACKS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL HAPPEN WITH CLOSE CLINICAL  GUIDANCE. ALSO, WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH CBCT HARDWARE VENDORS TO INCREASE THE IMPACT OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION PLAN.

COMMON RISK FACTORS INCLUDE SMOKING AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. HOWEVER, OTHER LOCAL HABITS, SUCH AS KHAT CHEWING, CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REGIONAL HIGHER PREVALENCE (UP TO 40% OF ALL CANCER CASES IN SOME ASIAN COUNTRIES). CURRENTLY, IDENTIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS OF ORAL CANCER RELY ON VISUAL INSPECTION FOLLOWED BY BIOPSY AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. THIS PROCEDURE IS LENGTHY, COSTLY AND OFTEN PRONE TO ERROR. AS A RESULT, ORAL CANCER TODAY IS OFTEN DIAGNOSED AT ADVANCED STAGES THAT HAVE POOR PROGNOSIS WITH A 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE HOVERING AROUND 50% FOR DECADES. EVEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CURED, THEY OFTEN FACE SEVERE MORBIDITIES, SUCH AS DISFIGUREMENT, SPEECH AND SWALLOWING DIFFICULTIES. HOWEVER, IF ORAL CANCER CAN BE DIAGNOSED EARLY AND ALLOWING EARLY INTERVENTION, SURVIVAL RATE CAN IMPROVE TO ~ 90%. TESTING FOR SALIVARY BIOMARKERS REPRESENTS A PROMISING APPROACH FOR SCREENING AND DIAGNOSING ORAL CANCER EARLIER, SINCE 1) SALIVA COLLECTION IS CONVENIENT AND CAN BE PERFORMED EVEN AT THE DENTIST\u2019S OFFICE, AND 2) SALIVA IS CLOSEST TO THE PRIMARY SITE OF TUMOR DEVELOPMENT WHICH CAN CONTAIN MOLECULES INDICATIVE OF MALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION. HENCE, WITH APPROPRIATE BIOMARKERS, A SIMPLE SALIVA TEST CAN BE DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED AT THE POINT-OF-CARE (POC, E.G., DENTIST\u2019S OFFICE) FOR RAPID SCREENING AND EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF ORAL CANCER.  RECENTLY, FROM A NUMBER OF CLINICAL STUDIES GLOBALLY, PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES HAVE EMERGED AS PROMISING BIOMARKERS FOR SCREENING AND DIAGNOSING ORAL CANCER WITH GOOD SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY.

IMPACT \u2013 THIS PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE STRONG RATIONALE AND PRELIMINARY DATA TO SUPPORT FURTHER STUDY AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF A 3D-PRINTABLE PEKK/SI3N4 COMPOSITE FOR CMF IMPLANTS, WHICH COULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE IMPLANT FAILURES DUE TO INFECTION AND/OR POOR BONE INTEGRATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "UT", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f367efb6-5526-aae2-a1ab-d12cfb6c93af-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R43DE031456_7529"}, {"internal_id": 139743375, "Award ID": "R43DE031196", "Award Amount": 281523.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-08-20", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "PERIODONTAL ULTRASOUND/PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGING (PUPI) - PROJECT SUMMARY THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DESIGN AND VALIDATE A PERIODONTAL ULTRASOUND/PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGING (PUPI) DEVICE WHICH CAN NON-INVASIVELY MEASURE PERIODONTAL POCKET DEPTH, CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LOSS BASED ON CEMENTOENAMEL JUNCTION (CEJ) LOCATION, GINGIVAL BIOTYPE AND INFLAMMATION. CURRENT PERIODONTAL EVALUATION METHODS ARE INACCURATE BECAUSE THEY ARE BASED ON VISUAL INSPECTION AND PERIODONTAL PROBING. WHILE RADIOGRAPHY OFFERS DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT HARD TISSUES SUCH AS BONE AND TEETH, MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT SOFT TISSUE IS USUALLY MISSED IN RADIOGRAPHY. ULTRASOUND/PHOTOACOUSTIC APPROACH HAS BEEN USED IN SOFT TISSUE IMAGING BUT RARELY IN DENTISTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LARGE SIZE TRANSDUCER WHICH LIMITS THE ENTIRE ORAL CAVITY SCAN. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, STYLOSONIC LLC WILL CONSTRUCT AND VALIDATE A MINIATURIZED HANDPIECE WITH A COMPACT LASER DIODE FOR ULTRASOUND/PHOTOACOUSTIC IMAGING TO PROVIDE KEY PERIODONTAL METRICS. PUPI OFFERS REAL-TIME, ACCURATE, AND REPEATABLE MEASUREMENTS WITH UTILITY IN DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY MONITORING. THAT IS THE VALUE OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE WORKFLOW WILL INCLUDE TWO PARTS: AIM 1 WILL DESIGN AND FABRICATE THE PUPI PROTOTYPE AND AIM 2 WILL EVALUATE THE FUNDAMENTAL FUNCTIONALITY OF THE DEVICE AND CONFIRM THE VALIDATION IN A PILOT CLINICAL STUDY IN COLLABORATION WITH DR. CASEY CHEN AT UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 100 TEETH (5-10 PATIENTS) WITH MODERATE PERIODONTITIS (POCKET DEPTH: 4-6 MM) WILL BE EVALUATED WITH PUPI AND MANUAL PROBING METHOD BEFORE AND 4-WEEK AFTER THE NONSURGICAL TREATMENT (I.E., SCALING AND ROOT PLANNING). THAT WILL GIVE US 80% STATISTICAL POWER ASSUMING AN ALPHA OF 0.05 BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA. OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD A HANDPIECE THAT CAN EASILY SCAN THE ENTIRE ORAL CAVITY. WE WILL TEST THE DESIGNED MINIATURIZED HANDPIECE USING AN ORAL CARE MANIKIN. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN PROBING AND PUPI IS R2 > 0.8. WE ALSO HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE PUPI WILL SHOW A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN POCKET DEPTH, CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LOSS, GINGIVAL BIOTYPE AND INFLAMMATION BEFORE AND FOUR WEEKS AFTER TREATMENT (P <0.05). THIS APPROACH IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE MINIATURIZED HANDPIECE OF PUPI WILL PROVIDE ANATOMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION OF THE ENTIRE GINGIVA ARCHITECTURE. IN ADDITION, PUPI WILL ENABLE ACCURATE DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPY MONITORING WHICH ADD ENORMOUS VALUE FOR RECOMMENDED TREATMENT AND ENSURE BEST OUTCOMES. THE CLINICAL IMPACT IS THE PROPOSED DEVICE WILL ASSIST DENTISTS AND PERIODONTISTS TO ACCURATELY DIAGNOSE GINGIVITIS IN THE EARLY STAGE AND REDUCE THE RATE OF ADVANCED PERIODONTITIS.

UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT SURGICAL TREATMENTS, INCLUDING ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY, OPEN RECONSTRUCTION, AND DISTRACTION OSTEOGENESIS (DO), SUFFER INHERENT DRAWBACKS, IMPACTING OUTCOMES. A BETTER SOLUTION IS NEEDED FOR THIS VULNERABLE PATIENT POPULATION. DO IS A WIDELY RECOGNIZED TREATMENT MODALITY THAT HARNESSES THE BODY\u2019S NATURAL ABILITY TO REGENERATE BONE IN ORDER TO CORRECT SKELETAL DEFICIENCIES AND DEFECTS. WHILE STILL EMERGING FOR CRANIOMAXILLOFACIAL (CMF) APPLICATIONS, SURGEONS HAVE SHOWN THE UTILITY OF DO FOR RESTORING FUNCTIONAL DISCREPANCIES IN PATIENTS WITH CRANIOFACIAL DIFFERENCES. THE TECHNIQUE OF DO INVOLVES SURGICAL PLACEMENT OF ONE OR MORE DISTRACTORS, WHICH ARE DEVICES USED TO SLOWLY SEPARATE TWO OPPOSING BONY FRAGMENTS AT AN OSTEOTOMY SITE, TO GRADUALLY LENGTHEN AND RESHAPE THE AFFECTED BONE AND STIMULATE NEW BONE GROWTH. HOWEVER, DO IS NOT WITHOUT SHORTCOMINGS. FIRST, ALL CURRENT DISTRACTORS HAVE AN EXTERNAL COMPONENT FOR MANUAL EXPANSION. THE EXTERNAL COMPONENT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES PATIENT RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS INFECTION (35%), DEVICE DISLODGEMENT (3.0%), INCREASED ANALGESIC USE, AND SCARRING (15.6%). SECOND, SINCE THE BURDENSOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANUAL EXPANSION LIES WITH THE CAREGIVER, TREATMENT NONCOMPLIANCE (4.7%) IS A SERIOUS ISSUE, INTRODUCING VULNERABILITIES RANGING FROM INCONSISTENT DEVICE EXPANSION TO COMPLETE TREATMENT FAILURE. THEREFORE, DO NECESSITATES EXTENSIVE PHYSICIAN CLINIC TIME AND PATIENT RADIATION EXPOSURE TO MONITOR THERAPEUTIC PROGRESS AND THUS HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED IN THE CMF SKELETON DESPITE RECOGNITION OF POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OVER ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY (NARROWER INDICATION FOR USE) AND OPEN RECONSTRUCTION (MORE INVASIVE, LONGER ANESTHESIA TIME, HIGHER BLOOD TRANSFUSION RATE, LONGER HOSPITAL STAY). THE OSTIIO DISTRACTION (OD) SYSTEM ADDRESSES MANY OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH DO TREATMENT AS THE FIRST FULLY SUBCUTANEOUS, CONTACTLESS DO SYSTEM FOR THE CMF SKELETON. AT A HIGH LEVEL, THE OD SYSTEM LEVERAGES MAGNETIC COUPLING TO TRANSFER TORQUE FROM THE HAND-HELD DRIVER (HHD) TO THE IMPLANT, THEREBY EXPANDING THE IMPLANT IN A CONTACTLESS FASHION. THIS NOVEL APPROACH WILL MARKEDLY REDUCE INFECTION, SCARRING, AND MANIPULATION NONCOMPLIANCE. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE DESIGN UNIQUELY PERMITS WIRELESS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE IMPLANT AND HHD, IT WILL ENABLE PHYSICIANS TO BETTER CONTROL AND MONITOR TREATMENT PROGRESS. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO VALIDATE A KEY PERFORMANCE SPEC OF THE OD SYSTEM BY DEMONSTRATING IT CAN RIGOROUSLY MEET DISTRACTION FORCE PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS SIMILAR TO THOSE ACHIEVED BY THE CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE. SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THIS OUTCOME WILL SUPPORT PHASE II IN WHICH WE WILL FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE OD SYSTEM BY VALIDATING FUNCTION AND PERFORMANCE IN AN IN VIVO MODEL AND FORMATIVE HUMAN FACTORS STUDY.

THE BONE VOID FILLER DESIGNED IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT CAN BE IMPLANTED AS A PASTE THEN QUICKLY TRANSITION TO A SOLID AFTER INITIATION WITH BLUE LIGHT. THE ABILITY TO TRANSITION INTO A SOLID AFTER PLACEMENT IS UNIQUE TO BONE FILLERS THAT REGENERATE BONE RATHER THAN FILLING THE DEFECT WITH A SYNTHETIC MATERIAL SUCH AS BONE CEMENT.

MILLION ADULTS WITH MODERATE FEAR AND OVER 14 MILLION ADULTS WITH SEVERE FEAR VISIT THE DENTIST. BECAUSE FEAR PORTENDS POOR FUTURE ORAL HEALTH, PATIENTS WITH DENTAL FEAR COME TO EXPERIENCE THEIR WORST FEARS: PAIN, SURGICAL PROCEDURES, AND THE NEED FOR MORE FREQUENT DENTAL VISITS. AVOIDANCE IS THE NATURAL AND REINFORCED RESPONSE, IRONICALLY GUARANTEEING A REPETITION OF THE FEARED EVENTS. BREAKING THIS CYCLE IS THE PRIMARY TARGET OF THIS PROPOSAL. STANDARD TREATMENT \u2014 COMPASSIONATE BUT ULTIMATELY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE \u2014 INCLUDES ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION OR MORE SUBSTANTIAL ANESTHESIA, WHICH (A) DOES NOTHING TO REDUCE SUBSEQUENT ANXIETY OR AVOIDANCE, (B) LEADS TO CONTINUED DENTAL PROBLEMS, AND (C) PERPETUATES THE CYCLE OF FEAR\u2014>AVOIDANCE\u2014>DENTAL PROBLEMS. ALTERNATIVELY, COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS (CBT) FOR DENTAL FEAR HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, SUBJECTED TO DOZENS OF HIGH-QUALITY TRIALS, AND FOUND TO BE EFFICACIOUS. HOWEVER, CBT HAS, ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY, BEEN OFFERED ONLY IN A FEW SPECIALTY CLINICS WORLDWIDE ASSOCIATED WITH UNIVERSITIES; THERE IS NO DISSEMINABLE MODEL FOR INTEGRATING CBT INTO THE WORKFLOW OF DENTAL PRACTICES. TO FILL THIS GAP, THIS FAST-TRACK STTR PROPOSAL DESCRIBES PLANS FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A MARKETABLE PRODUCT THAT CAN BRING EFFECTIVE DENTAL FEAR TREATMENT TO DENTAL OFFICES WITHIN THE CURRENTLY EXISTING U.S. PRACTICE ECOSYSTEM. NEVR FEAR THE DENTISTTM IS A COMMERCIALIZABLE SUITE OF SELF-ADMINISTERED EHEALTH TOOLS TO TREAT DENTAL FEAR THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRIVATE PRACTICE DENTAL OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE U.S. AND IS EMINENTLY SCALABLE. NEVR FEAR THE DENTISTTM COMPRISES THREE MAJOR EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. FIRST IS A SELF-ADMINISTERED EHEALTH APP FOR CBT/PSYCHOEDUCATION WITH EXPOSURE THERAPY \u2014 DELIVERED VIA A MOBILE TABLET \u2014 THAT CAN BE USED PRIVATELY IN WAITING ROOMS. SECOND IS A COMMUNICATION-ELICITING INTERVENTION, IN WHICH THE PATIENT RECORDS A \u201cPRE-GAME PLAN\u201d \u2014 TO BE REVIEWED WITH THE DENTAL STAFF BEFORE DENTAL SERVICES \u2014 COMPRISING (1) PRE-TREATMENT FEAR LEVELS, (2) THE FACTOR GENERATING THE MOST ANXIETY, (3) A STOP-SIGNAL THE PATIENT WILL USE TO ALERT DENTIST, (4) THINGS THE DENTAL TEAM CAN DO TO MAXIMIZE THIS PATIENT'S COMFORT, AND (5) A SELF-GENERATED ANXIETY MANAGEMENT PLAN. ALL PATIENTS IN THE TREATMENT GROUP WILL RECEIVE THE FIRST TWO EBIS AS A SINGLE INTERVENTION ON THE TABLET. THIRD (FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE IN THE SEVERE RANGE) IS A 1-HR VIRTUAL REALITY EXPOSURE TREATMENT (VRET). VRET WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE CBT THAT CAN BE SELF-ADMINISTERED WITHIN THE NORMAL OPERATIONS OF DENTISTRY AND WILL ALLOW EVERY DENTAL PRACTICE TO BE A DENTAL FEAR SPECIALTY CLINIC. SUCH AN APPROACH IS NECESSARY TO SHIFT CLINICAL PRACTICE, AS THE NEARLY 200,000 U.S. DENTISTS WILL ONLY ADOPT AN APPROACH DESIGNED, FROM THE BOTTOM UP, TO FIT BOTH THE BUSY-NESS AND BUSINESS OF 21ST-CENTURY DENTAL PRACTICES. THE RESEARCH COMPONENT WILL USE AN ADEQUATELY POWERED RCT TO TEST BOTH (A) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NEVR FEAR THE DENTISTTM AND, USING THE NIH'S EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE APPROACH TO BEHAVIORAL CHANGE MODEL, (B) WHETHER INHIBITORY LEARNING IS THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH IT AFFECTS CHANGE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "GA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "932aeb18-c482-1388-2b3b-38beeaf3ed2d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R42DE030040_7529"}, {"internal_id": 107115259, "Award ID": "R42DE028215", "Award Amount": 1494885.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-07-29", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY FOR STEM CELL BASED TMJ REGENERATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "e70ac677-ba7d-1868-ef24-5d40b20acf89-R", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R42DE028215_7529"}, {"internal_id": 151949545, "Award ID": "R42DE028212", "Award Amount": 1608347.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-15", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "A NOVEL REMEDY FOR PERIODONTAL BONE LOSS - PERIODONTITIS IS A COMMON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY DESTRUCTION OF THE SUPPORTING STRUCTURES OF THE TEETH (THE PERIODONTAL LIGAMENT AND ALVEOLAR BONE). THE TOTAL PREVALENCE OF PERIODONTITIS IN ADULTS AGED 30 YEARS AND OLDER WAS 47.2% (REPRESENTING ABOUT 64.7 MILLION ADULTS AGED 30 YEARS AND OLDER) AND 70.1% IN ADULTS AGED 65 YEARS AND OLDER IN THE U.S. THE CURRENT TREATMENT OPTION FOR PERIODONTAL DISEASES INVOLVES MECHANICAL DEBRIDEMENT \u2013 SCALING AND ROOT PLANING WHICH REQUIRES FREQUENT AND MULTIPLE VISITS TO THE DENTIST AND IS SOMETIMES FOLLOWED BY ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY OF LOCAL DELIVERY OF ANTIMICROBIALS OR SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS SUCH AS DOXYCYCLINE. THE DISADVANTAGES OF CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE INCONVENIENT AND PAINFUL EXPERIENCE, FAILURE OF ANTIMICROBIAL TO PENETRATE BEYOND BIOFILM SURFACE LAYER, RISKS TO PROMOTE ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE, AND SYSTEMIC SIDE EFFECTS. OTHER LIMITATION OF CURRENT TREATMENT IS THAT NONE OF THESE DRUGS ARE TARGETING HOST AND PERIODONTAL BONE LOSS. THERE IS A MAJOR VOID IN PERIODONTAL DISEASE THERAPEUTICS PRODUCTS WHICH CAN TARGET HOST RESPONSE AND IS EASY TO USE. THE GLOBAL PERIODONTAL DISEASE THERAPEUTICS MARKET IS ANTICIPATED TO GAIN A GROWTH OF 8.7% FROM 2016 TO 2024. AT THIS PACE, THE MARKET IS ESTIMATED TO REACH A VALUATION OF US$537.2M BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. PERIOMICS CARE IS AN EARLY-STAGE NEW YORK BASED BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT WAS ESTABLISHED TO COMMERCIALIZE A NOVEL ORAL GEL FORMULATION FOR TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE. IN PHASE I WE HAVE SYNTHESIZED, FORMULATED, TESTED AND PATENTED POC7A, AN ANTAGONIST FORMULATION TO TARGET SUCCINATE RECEPTOR (SUCNR1) AS A TREATMENT FOR PERIODONTAL DISEASE. IN PHASE II PERIOMICS CARE PROPOSES TO SCALE UP THE SYNTHESIS AND FORMULATION OF POC7A TO CONDUCT PHARMACOKINETICS/ PHARMACODYNAMICS, AND TOXICITY OF POC7A IN BEAGLE DOGS (AIM1). WE WILL FURTHER TEST THIS FORMULATION IN LIGATURE INDUCED NON-HUMAN PRIMATE (NHP) MODEL TO VALIDATE OUR FINDING THAT POC7A EFFECTIVELY RESCUES PERIODONTAL BONE LOSS (AIM 2). NHP MODEL IS THE BEST SUITABLE MODEL FOR THIS STUDY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RESEMBLANCE IN TERMS OF PATHWAYS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES AND TARGETS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO HUMAN DISEASE. MORE IMPORTANTLY NHP HAVE ORAL STRUCTURES AND TEETH SIMILAR TO THOSE OF HUMANS AND HAVE NATURALLY OCCURRING DENTAL PLAQUE, CALCULUS, ORAL MICROBIAL PATHOGENS AND DEVELOP SIMILAR PERIODONTAL SYMPTOMS. THE PREMISE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON OUR FINDINGS IN PHASE I THAT BLOCKING SUCNR1 BY POC7A CAN REDUCE INFLAMMATION, ALTER SUBGINGIVAL MICROBIOME AND RESCUE BONE LOSS. THE TECHNOLOGY AND FORMULATION DEVELOPED IN PHASE I IS NOW IP PROTECTED. THE FUNDS GAINED FROM THIS STTR PHASE II GRANT WILL BE USED FOR (1) SYNTHESIS AND TESTING OF THE FORMULATION, AND (2) DETERMINING THE EFFICACY OF THE FORMULATION IN PERIODONTAL NHP MODEL.

DUE TO MINIMUM INFORMATION LOSS (COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL 2D RADIOGRAPHY) AND LOW RADIATION EXPOSURE (COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL CT), IT HAS BECOME THE \u201cGO-TO\u201d RADIOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUE IN VARIOUS DENTAL FIELDS. GAPS: ACCOMPANYING THE CLEAR BENEFITS OF DENTAL CBCT IS AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF 3D DATA PRESENTED TO CLINICIANS. CLINICIAN-BASED CBCT INTERPRETATION SUFFERS FROM LOW INTER-/INTRA-OBSERVER AGREEMENT AND LOW ACCURACY. AI/DEEP LEARNING (DL) HOLDS GREAT PROMISE TO AUTOMATE CBCT IMAGE ANALYSIS AND PROVIDE OBJECTIVE, ACCURATE DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT CLINICAL DECISION. HOWEVER, LIMITED RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE DUE TO UNIQUE AND SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES: (1) DENTAL CBCT PROVIDES 3D IMAGES COMPOSED OF A COMPLICATED MIX OF DIFFERENT ORAL STRUCTURES/CONTENTS, PREVENTING THE DIRECT USE OF EXISTING GENERAL-PURSE DL ALGORITHMS FOR IMAGE SEGMENTATION AND CALLING FOR NEW DL DESIGNS. (2) AI/DL IS KNOWN TO BE DATA-HUNGRY. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF ACCURATELY-ANNOTATED CBCT IMAGES TO TRAIN DL DUE TO COMPLEX ORAL ANATOMY AND INEVITABLE HUMAN ERRORS, WHICH CALLS FOR EFFICIENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE ANNOTATION EFFORT FOR DL TRAINING. (3) DUE TO THESE CHALLENGES, THE CURRENT SOFTWARE SYSTEMS USED TO ASSIST CLINICIANS IN DENTAL CBCT INTERPRETATION DO NOT PROVIDE ADVANCED AI- BASED LESION DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS CAPABILITIES, WHICH MAKES THIS STTR PROJECT TIMELY AND IMPORTANT. WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A DL ALGORITHM THAT INTEGRATES UNIQUE ORAL ANATOMY INTO THE DL DESIGN, NAMELY \u201cANATOMICALLY-CONSTRAINED DENSE UNET (AC-UNET)\u201d. IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING ACCURACY, AC-UNET IS ALSO ANNOTATION-EFFICIENT AS IT IS NOT ONLY TRAINED USING CBCT IMAGES BUT ALSO CONSTRAINED BY ANATOMICAL DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE THROUGH NOVEL MATHEMATICAL ENCODING AND POSTERIOR REGULARIZATION-BASED OPTIMIZATION. APPLIED TO A PRELIMINARY DATASET OF CBCTS WITH PERIAPICAL LESIONS INDICATIVE OF APICAL PERIODONTITIS (AP), AC-UNET ACHIEVED HIGH ACCURACY IN SEGMENTATION AND LESION DETECTION ON CBCT IMAGES AND OUTPERFORMED STATE-OF-THE-ART DL ALGORITHMS. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO DEVELOP THE FIRST-EVER AI-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEM CALLED \u201cAIDEN\u201d TO PERFORM AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION, LESION DETECTION, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS BASED ON DENTAL CBCT FOR A VARIETY OF JAW LESIONS/DISEASES WITH HIGH ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AND REPRODUCIBILITY. AIDEN WILL ASSIST CLINICIANS IN PROVIDING OPTIMAL TREATMENT DECISION FOR EACH PATIENT. OUR PHASE-I GOAL IS TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF AIDEN FOR LESION DETECTION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOCUSING ON AP, A HIGHLY-PREVALENT JAW LESION/DISEASE. THREE AIMS ARE: (1) OPTIMIZE DESIGN: TO DEVELOP AN EXTENSION OF AC-UNET TO INTEGRATE A BROADER RANGE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORAL-ANATOMICAL KNOWLEDGE INTO THE DL DESIGN; (2) OPTIMIZE TRAINING: TO DEVELOP AN ACTIVE LEARNING STRATEGY TO FURTHER IMPROVE ANNOTATION EFFICIENCY OF AC-UNET TRAINING; (3) CLINICAL VALIDATION AND PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF DIAGNOSIS CAPABILITY FOR CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT.

THEY CAN BE A MANIFESTATION OF TRAUMA OR A SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY PROCESS OR OFTEN THEY ARE TRULY IDIOPATHIC. THEY CAN CAUSE SEVERE PAIN AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LIMIT ORAL INTAKE OF FLUIDS. THE STANDARD OF CARE CURRENTLY IS SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT INVOLVING DIETARY CHANGES AND TOPICAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, ANTISEPTICS, OR ANESTHESIA. IN SEVERE CASES, SYSTEMIC IMMUNOMODULATORY AGENTS ARE USED. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO EPITHELIZATION AGENT AVAILABLE THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE HISTOLOGICAL PROBLEM. FOR THIS PROJECT, WE WILL LEVERAGE THE COMBINED EXPERTISE OF THE SANTA MARIA LAB, WHICH DEVELOPED HB-EGF FOR TOPICAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE ORAL CAVITY, WITH AURATION BIOTECH, WHO HAVE ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY PRECLINICALLY TRANSLATED THE SAME BIOLOGIC TO CLINICAL TRIALS FOR ANOTHER INDICATION. OUR INNOVATIVE APPROACH AIMS TO BE THE FIRST AVAILABLE TO ACCELERATE APHTHOUS ULCER WOUND HEALING THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE EPITHELIUM. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT LOCALLY ADMINISTERED HB-EGF ACCELERATES AND THICKENS EPITHELIALIZATION AND MAKES THE NEO EPITHELIAL LAYER MORE ADHERENT TO THE UNDERLYING WOUND.

AT THE CORE OF BOTH TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES ARE THE LEADING EXPERTS IN ORAL MICROBIOLOGY, DENTAL MATERIALS, AND TISSUE REGENERATION. WE HAVE EXPANDED THE BREADTH OF OPPORTUNITIES BY CREATING A SECOND RESEARCH TRACK TO INCLUDE COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND NUTRITION. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN INTERNSHIP IN SOUTHWESTERN OREGON FOR LEARNERS WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO SPEND A SUMMER IN PORTLAND DUE TO THE DISTANCE. SUMMER INTERNS WILL BE WELCOMED INTO THESE RICH LABORATORY AND COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTS. WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE STATE OF OREGON'S COMMUNITY LEADERS IN RURAL HEALTH AND IN DIVERSITY TO ATTRACT A ROBUST COHORT OF APPLICANTS REPRESENTING UNDER-REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND NONTRADITIONAL LEARNERS.

AIM 1 WILL DISCOVER GENOMIC REGIONS DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED IN PROGRESSIVE VS. STATIC LOW-GRADE ODS USING WHOLE GENOME BISULFITE SEQUENCING (WGBS) ON SAMPLES WITH LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UPS. AIM 2 WILL CREATE DMR-BASED MODELS AND VALIDATE THEIR POWER IN PREDICTING THE RISK OF LOW-GRADE ODS IN PROGRESSION TO OSCC. A SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION IS EXPECTED TO DISCOVER NEW DMRS CAPABLE OF DIFFERENTIATING PROGRESSIVE VS. STATIC ODS AND CREATE NOVEL RISK-PREDICTION DMR MODELS. THE OUTCOME WILL FILL THE CRITICAL NEED FOR A SENSITIVE AND RELIABLE SCREENING METHOD TO PREDICT THE RISK OF OPLS IN BECOMING OSCCS AT AN EARLY STAGE, WHEN MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AND LESS DAMAGING, WHICH WILL LEAD TO A DIRECT IMPACT ON REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF OSCC AND RELATED HEALTH ISSUES, AS WELL AS FINDING NOVEL DNA METHYLATION MECHANISMS DRIVING THE MALIGNANT PROGRESSION OF OSCC THAT MAY BE DRUGGABLE.

THEREFORE, IDENTIFYING NEW MOLECULES THAT TARGET CANCER PATHWAYS, ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, IS CRITICAL FOR DEVELOPING NOVEL CANCER THERAPIES. IN HNSCC, DYSREGULATED RNA-BINDING PROTEINS (RBPS) CONTROLS CO- AND POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL EVENTS. APPROACHES TARGETING RBPS ARE NOT WELL ESTABLISHED TO REGULATE THE GENE EXPRESSION IN CANCERS.

SECOND, THE UPREGULATION OF KEY OSTEOANABOLIC PATHWAYS THAT COORDINATE CELL PROLIFERATION AND THE OSTEOGENIC CASCADE. NOVEL METHODS TO ENHANCE ONE OR BOTH OF THESE FACTORS ARE NEEDED TO SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE THE FIELD.

IN 2015, IT WAS FURTHER ESTABLISHED THAT THESE REGIONS HAVE ENHANCED OSTEOANABOLIC SIGNALING AND INCREASED EXPRESSION OF GENES RELATED TO PROLIFERATION, SELF-RENEWAL, AND THE STEM CELL NICHE.

THE ASSOCIATED SOCIO-ECONOMIC BURDENS ARE SIGNIFICANT, AND PATIENTS OFTEN SUFFER FROM THE CHRONIC AND DISTRESSING SYMPTOMS. RECENT STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) HYPERGLYCEMIA IS A RISK FACTOR OF PERI-IMPLANTITIS. HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR HOW HYPERGLYCEMIA CONTRIBUTES TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF PERI-IMPLANTITIS.

THE HEALING OF BONE DEFECTS RELIES ON THE REGENERATIVE CAPABILITY OF CALVARIAL BONES TO REPLACE DAMAGED BONE TISSUES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF SKELETAL STEM CELLS (SSCS) IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS FOR GENERATING NEW BONES TO RESTORE BOTH STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL INTEGRITY.

MOREOVER, OUR LABORATORY HAS SHOWN THAT THE CXCL10-CXCR3 AXIS IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR PD DEVELOPMENT. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT EXPERIMENTALLY-INDUCED PERIODONTAL BONE LOSS (EPD), IN MICE, IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WHEN THE CXCL10 RECEPTOR CXCR3, IS DELETED. MOREOVER, SYSTEMIC, AND LOCAL DELIVERY OF A CXCR3 ANTAGONIST ATTENUATES EPD, POINTING TO THE TARGETING OF CXCL10 AS A POTENTIAL INTERVENTION FOR PD.

BECAUSE BOTH TSPO AND MINS ARE OVEREXPRESSED BY GLIAL CELLS, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NEUROINFLAMMATION MIGHT BE A PERVASIVE PHENOMENON THAT CAN BE OBSERVED ACROSS MULTIPLE, ETIOLOGICALLY HETEROGENEOUS HUMAN PAIN DISORDERS, BUT IN A DISORDER-SPECIFIC SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. DESPITE THESE ADVANCES, THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE BRAIN INFLAMMATORY SIGNALS (E.G., WHETHER NEUROINFLAMMATION IMAGING COULD BE USED TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND TO ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THERAPIES) REMAINS TO BE EVALUATED.  IN THIS EXPLORATORY PROJECT, WE WILL RECRUIT PTN PATIENTS SCHEDULED TO RECEIVE ORAL STEROID THERAPY. ALL PARTICIPANTS WILL BE EVALUATED CLINICALLY BY AN EXPERIENCED NEUROLOGIST AND, PRIOR TO COMMENCING THEIR TREATMENT, RECEIVE BRAIN IMAGING WITH INTEGRATED (I.E., SIMULTANEOUS) POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY / MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (PET/MRI) AND [11C]PBR28, A SECOND-GENERATION RADIOLIGAND FOR TSPO, WHICH WE HAVE USED TO DEMONSTRATE GLIAL ACTIVATION IN PATIENTS WITH PAIN OR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS. AFTER THE SCAN, PARTICIPANTS WILL UNDERGO A 3-WEEK TREATMENT WITH THE STEROID PREDNISONE, FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER CLINICAL/BEHAVIORAL VISIT. CLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION WILL INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE SENSORY TESTING AND QUESTIONNAIRES. PATIENTS\u2019 IMAGING DATA WILL BE COMPARED TO AN EXISTING DATASET OF HEALTHY CONTROLS AND CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS WITH A DIFFERENT ETIOLOGY (CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN) TO ASSESS THE SPECIFICITY OF OUR FINDINGS TO PTN.  FOR AIM 1, WE WILL ASSESS IN-VIVO NEUROINFLAMMATION IN PAINFUL TRIGEMINAL NEUROPATHY, USING MULTIMODAL BRAIN IMAGING.

THE DISC PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN TMJ MOVEMENT, BY ALLOWING THE CONDYLE TO FREELY SLIDE DOWN THE SLOPE OF THE GLENOID FOSSA. TMJ DISORDERS (DISRUPTION IN THE STRUCTURE, FUNCTION OR PHYSIOLOGY OF THE TMJ) AFFLICT APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE U.S. POPULATION, AND UP TO 70% OF THE CONDITIONS ARE DUE TO TMJ DISC DISPLACEMENT AND/OR DAMAGE.

A CRITICAL GAP IN KNOWLEDGE IS TO CLARIFY THE EXTENT TO WHICH JOINT LUBRICANTS ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE TMJ DISC. WE FOUND THAT TMJS OF PRG4-NULL (PRG4-/-) MICE EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DEGENERATIVE CHANGES COMPARED TO OTHER SYNOVIAL JOINTS, INCLUDING THE KNEE.

FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS UNCLEAR WHY THE VAST MAJORITY OF TUMOR CELLS ARE SUCCESSFULLY ELIMINATED BY TREATMENT, YET A FEW ESCAPE DESTRUCTION. ARE THESE CELLS IN A PRIVILEGED CELL STATE THAT ENABLES EVASION OF THESE DRUGS? OR DOES RESISTANCE EMERGE ADAPTIVELY UPON TREATMENT? GIVEN THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH HNSCC, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, BUT THIS HAS BEEN PREVENTED BY TWO MAJOR OBSTACLES. FIRST, HNSCC TUMORS ARE HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS, SO BULK GENOMIC METHODS CANNOT DISCERN SUBPOPULATIONS OF CELLS THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO RESISTANT CLONES. SECOND, NEARLY ALL EXISTING GENOMIC METHODS ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND REQUIRE SPECIMEN LYSIS AT THE TIME OF MEASUREMENT.

TO OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS, WE HAVE RECENTLY UTILIZED SINGLE-CELL RNA- SEQ (SCRNA-SEQ) TO CHARACTERIZE HETEROGENEITY AMONG HNSCC TUMORS, DEFINING A PARTIAL EPITHELIAL-TO- MESENCHYMAL (P-EMT) PROGRAM WHICH PREDICTS HNSCC OUTCOMES (PURAM ET AL., CELL).

SARS-COV-2 SPIKE (S) PROTEIN BINDS TO ITS COGNATE RECEPTOR, ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME 2 (ACE2), AND IN CONCERT WITH HOST PROTEASES, PRINCIPALLY TRANSMEMBRANE SERINE PROTEASES (TMPRSSS), PROMOTES CELLULAR ENTRY. CO-EXPRESSIONS OF THESE VIRAL ENTRY FACTORS ARE FOUND IN THE EPITHELIAL CELLS OF MANY ORGANS, INCLUDING ORAL MUCOSA. RECENTLY, ORAL MUCOSA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE A POTENTIALLY HIGH-RISK ROUTE OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION. GRHL2, AS A TRANSCRIPTIONAL FACTOR, MODULATES EPITHELIAL GENE EXPRESSION AND PLASTICITY THROUGH MULTIPLE SIGNALING PATHWAYS. ACE2 AND TMPRSS2 ARE STRONGLY EXPRESSED IN EPITHELIAL CELLS, COINCIDING WITH THE PATTERN OF GRHL2 EXPRESSION IN ORAL MUCOSA. GRHL2 REGULATES ACE2 AND TMPRSS2 EXPRESSION IN NORMAL HUMAN ORAL KERATINOCYTES (NHOK). ECTOPIC EXPRESSION OF GRHL2 INDUCES ACE2 AND TMPRSSS EXPRESSION, WHILE KNOCKDOWN OF GRHL2 LEADS TO DECREASED LEVELS OF THESE ENTRY FACTORS. ACE2 IS AN INTERFERON-STIMULATED GENE. IFN-A ACTIVATES ACE2 EXPRESSION IN PART THROUGH REGULATING GRHL2. SMALL-MOLECULE INHIBITORS OF GRHL2 SUPPRESS VIRAL ENTRY FACTOR EXPRESSION IN NHOK. ACE2 AND TMPRSS2 ARE WIDELY EXPRESSED IN ORAL MUCOSAL EPITHELIUM, KNOCKOUT OF GRHL2 LEADS TO SUPPRESSION OF ACE2 AND TMPRSS2 EXPRESSION IN VIVO. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT GRHL2 IS REQUIRED FOR ACE2 AND TMPRSS EXPRESSION IN NHOK CULTURED IN VITRO AND ORAL MUCOSAL EPITHELIUM IN VIVO.

BECAUSE MOST CASES OF HNSCC RESULT FROM TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL EXPOSURE, THESE TUMORS ARE HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS, GREATLY COMPLICATING DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE BIOLOGY OF THIS DISEASE. WE RECENTLY PERFORMED SINGLE CELL RNA- SEQUENCING (SCRNA-SEQ) IN HNSCC AND IDENTIFIED A PARTIAL EPITHELIAL-TO-MESENCHYMAL (P-EMT) TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROGRAM THAT IS PREDICTIVE OF POOR CLINICAL OUTCOMES INCLUDING NODAL METASTASIS AND DIMINISHED SURVIVAL (PURAM ET AL., CELL). UNDERSTANDING THE REGULATORY FACTORS THAT CONTROL THE P-EMT PROGRAM IN HNSCC IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AS TARGETING MULTIPLE GENES IN A COMPLEX PATHWAY SUCH AS P-EMT IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING, YET HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE HNSCC OUTCOMES AND TREATMENT DECISION-MAKING. RNA MODIFICATION PROTEINS, WHICH CAN DIRECTLY READ/WRITE NUCLEOTIDE MARKS ON RNA, HAVE EMERGED AS ONE EXCITING CLASS OF SUCH REGULATORY PROTEINS. BECAUSE THESE PROTEINS MODULATE MULTIPLE RNA TRANSCRIPTS, TARGETING RNA MODIFICATION PROTEINS MAY DISRUPT EXPRESSION OF MULTIPLE DISEASE-RELATED GENES AND MAKE RESISTANCE LESS LIKELY TO EMERGE. IN HNSCC, WE HAVE FOUND THAT METTL3, AN RNA METHYLTRANSFERASE WHICH CATALYZES THE N6-METHYLADENOSINE (M6A) MODIFICATION, IS A KEY REGULATOR OF THE P-EMT PROGRAM IN HNSCC. IN PRELIMINARY STUDIES, WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT PERTURBATION OF METTL3 IN HNSCC DISRUPTS P-EMT SIGNALING AND REDUCES INVASION IN VITRO.

HOWEVER, 60% OF CLEFT PALATE PATIENTS SUFFER POOR WOUND HEALING FOLLOWING SURGERY WHICH LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ORO-NASAL FISTULA (ONF) CHARACTERIZED BY A CONTINUED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE ORAL AND NASAL CAVITIES. THE PRIMARY APPROACH TO REPAIR AN ONF IS BY USING HUMAN DONOR TISSUE, WHICH ACTS ONLY AS A PHYSICAL BARRIER AND CARRIES THE RISKS OF DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN DONOR TISSUE, SUCH AS PRIONS OR HIV INFECTION. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP NEW THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE WOUND HEALING AFTER CLEFT PALATE SURGICAL REPAIR, AND TO REDUCE THE CASES OF ONF. WOUND HEALING HAS BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY ON THE SKIN AND PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING INTESTINAL INJURY. INTESTINAL WOUND HEALING EFFICIENCY IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, ESPECIALLY THE MICROBIOME, WHERE SPECIFIC MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURES OR SUPPLEMENTATION WITH PROBIOTIC BACTERIA ENHANCES THE WOUND HEALING PROCESS.

ORAL HEALTH IS SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERVALUED UNDER THE CURRENT PRACTICE MODEL. ORAL HEALTH HAS NOT YET BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE NATIONAL PC PRACTICE GUIDELINE. PHYSICIANS OFTEN OVERLOOK ORAL HEALTH, AND THUS IT SEEMS TO BE LESS IMPORTANCE TO THEM. DISCOURAGED BY THIS FALSE IMPRESSION, PRPC AND FCG ALSO OFTEN UNDERVALUE ORAL HEALTH. AS A RESULT, THE ORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF PRPC SELDOM RECEIVE APPROPRIATE ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT, LEADING TO GREATER COMORBIDITY, AND SUFFERING. MEANWHILE, DENTISTS OFTEN LACK TRAINING IN END-OF-LIFE DENTAL CARE, RESULTING IN TERMINALLY-ILL NURSING HOME RESIDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF LIFE, RECEIVING EXTENSIVE DENTAL SURGERY AND OTHER AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT. THESE EVIDENCE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CURRENT PRACTICE MODEL FAILS TO APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS THE ORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF PRPC. A NEW CLINICAL PARADIGM IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS.

FUNCTIONALLY CHARACTERIZED. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT ORAL ROTHIA MUCILAGINOSA, A GRAM-POSITIVE ORAL COMMENSAL ACTINOBACTERIA, IS HIGHLY ABUNDANT IN SALIVA AND DENTAL PLAQUE IN GLOBAL HUMAN POPULATIONS, HOWEVER, ITS ECOLOGICAL ROLE IS UNKNOWN. WE IDENTIFIED THAT R. MUCILAGINOSA PRODUCED THE CATECHOL SIDEROPHORE ENTEROBACTIN, THE STRONGEST IRON-CHELATING MOLECULE KNOWN. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED THE ENTEROBACTIN BIOSYNTHETIC GENE CLUSTER (ENT-BGC) IN GLOBAL ROTHIA GENOMES, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT ENTEROBACTIN IS CRUCIAL IN ROTHIA ECOLOGY. THE PURIFIED ENTEROBACTIN COMPOUND IMPACTED GROWTH DIFFERENTIALLY WHEN AMENDED TO CULTURES OF OTHER ORAL BACTERIAL SPECIES. IT BOOSTED THE GROWTH OF COMMENSAL STREPTOCOCCUS SALIVARIUS WHILE IT REDUCED THE GROWTH OF SOME STRAINS OF PATHOGENIC S. MUTANS. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF R. MUCILAGINOSA PRODUCED ENTEROBACTIN IN INTERACTIONS WITH BOTH THE ORAL MICROBIOTA AND HUMAN ORAL EPITHELIAL CELLS REPRESENTING THE ORAL MUCOSA. WE PROPOSE AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH APPROACH WITH TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1: CHARACTERIZATION OF MOLECULAR AND ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF ORAL BACTERIA TO R. MUCILAGINOSA PRODUCED ENTEROBACTIN. THE ACTIVITIES OF ENTEROBACTIN WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BOTH IN HIGHLY DIVERSE ORAL IN VITRO GROWN BIOFILMS, AND IN BACTERIAL MONOCULTURES. THE CAPACITY TO IMPORT ENTEROBACTIN BY DIFFERENT BACTERIAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS WILL BE REVEALED BY AMENDING GROWTH CULTURES WITH FLUORESCENTLY RHODAMINE- LABELED ENTEROBACTIN, FLUORESCENCE-ACTIVATED CELL SORTING, AND CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY. MULTI-OMICS SEQUENCING WILL BE CONDUCTED TO CHARACTERIZE FUNCTIONAL CHANGES BOTH IN BIOFILM COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS IN SINGLE AND DUAL- SPECIES CULTURES, SPECIFICALLY TARGETING GENES ENCODING TRANSPORT PROTEINS AND RELEASE MECHANISMS OF ENTEROBACTIN. AIM 2: DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF ENTEROBACTIN ON ORAL MUCOSAL SENTINEL CELLS. CO-CULTIVATION SYSTEMS INCLUDING BOTH 2D AND 3D MODELS OF HUMAN ORAL EPITHELIAL CELLS WILL BE APPLIED TO STUDY INTERACTIONS WITH THE ORAL MICROBIOTA AND ENTEROBACTIN. OUTCOMES OF THE INTERACTIONS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY USING A MULTIPRONGED APPROACH INCLUDING A COMPARATIVE GENE TRANSCRIPTION APPROACH AND A GENE REPORTER SYSTEM THAT REVEALS ROS ACTIVATION IN HOST CELLS. PRODUCTION OF EXTRACELLULAR PRO- AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES IN CELL MEDIUM RELATION TO ENTEROBACTIN AND ORAL BACTERIA WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED TO ELUCIDATE INTERACTIONS OF IMPORTANCE. THE PROPOSED STUDY PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR KNOWLEDGE ON ENTEROBACTIN FUNCTIONAL ROLE IN THE ORAL MICROBIOTA, AND IN INTERACTIONS WITH HUMAN ORAL EPITHELIAL CELLS, WHICH IS SEVERELY LACKING.

ADDITIONALLY, THE KINETICS OF NEO-VASCULARIZATION DURING PULP REGENERATION IS UNKNOWN. WITHOUT SUCH KNOWLEDGE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF PULP REGENERATION.  HERE, WE PROPOSE TO USE COMBINATION OF ANGIOGENICALLY INDUCED DENTAL PULP STEM CELLS (DPSCS) AND NON- INDUCED DPSCS TO ENHANCE THE NEO-VASCULARIZATION DURING PULP REGENERATION. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE DESIGNED A NEW STUDY MODEL THAT ALLOWS US TO CONDUCT REAL-TIME KINETIC INSPECTION OF THE CELLULAR PROCESS DURING NEO- VASCULARIZATION UNDER THIS APPROACH.  OVERALL HYPOTHESIS: COMBINATION OF ANGIOGENICALLY INDUCED DPSCS AND NON-INDUCED DPSCS ALLOWS ACCELERATED AND STABILIZED NEO-VASCULARIZATION THEREBY TIMELY BLOOD PERFUSION WITH THE HOST VASCULAR SYSTEM CAN OCCUR AND MORE COMPLETE PULP REGENERATION CAN BE REACHED.

THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE RESECTION MARGINS, RESULTING IN HIGH RATES OF RESIDUAL DISEASE AND RECURRENCE. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO PROVIDE NON-INVASIVE BIOMARKER-BASED IMAGING OF AMELOBLASTOMAS BY PRECISELY LABELING TUMOR TISSUE. THIS WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS TUMOR MARGINS EITHER PRE- OR INTRAOPERATIVELY, ALLOWING CLINICIANS TO PROVIDE BETTER CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF A LABELED EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR (EGFR) ANTIBODY, PANITUMUMAB, FOR AMELOBLASTOMA TISSUE AND TO USE IT IN VIVO TO IMAGE TUMOR IN PRECLINICAL MODELS OF AMELOBLASTOMA. PREVIOUSLY, RESEARCH ON AMELOBLASTOMA HAS BEEN HINDERED BY THE LACK OF IN VIVO MODELS. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, IN COLLABORATION WITH ORAL SURGEONS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED PRIMARY PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFT MODELS OF AMELOBLASTOMA. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT FLUORESCENTLY-LABELED ANTI-EGFR, CETUXIMAB- IRDYE800, COULD SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY TUMOR TISSUE IN VIVO. HOWEVER, IT IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN WHETHER FLUORESCENT IMAGING IS SUFFICIENT TO DETECT TUMOR WITHIN BONE. TWO HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BE INVESTIGATED AS FOLLOWS: (1) TO DETERMINE THE IN VIVO SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF PANITUMUMAB-IRDYE800 AND 89ZR-PANITUMUMAB FOR HUMAN AMELOBLASTOMA PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFTS (PDX). WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT PANITUMUMAB-IRDYE800 AND 89ZR-PANITUMUMAB WILL HAVE HIGHER SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY FOR AMELOBLASTOMA TUMOR TISSUE COMPARED TO CONTROLS. (2) TO DETERMINE THE CLINICAL VALIDITY OF PANITUMUMAB-IRDYE800- AND 89ZR-PANITUMUMAB-BASED IMAGING FOR THE SURGICAL REMOVAL OF TUMORS USING INTRAOSSEOUS MODELS OF AMELOBLASTOMA. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BOTH PANITUMUMAB-IRDYE800 AND 89ZR-PANITUMUMAB WILL SPECIFICALLY LOCALIZE TO AMELOBLASTOMAS AND ALLOW ACCURATE MARGIN DETERMINATION AND SURGICAL REMOVAL OF TUMORS. WE UTILIZE A NEW INTRAOSSEOUS ORTHOTOPIC ANIMAL MODEL AND NOVEL IMAGING PROBES TO NON-INVASIVELY IMAGE, STRATIFY AND GUIDE SURGICAL RESECTION IN AMELOBLASTOMAS. PET/CT IMAGING OF NOVEL RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL, 89ZR-PANITUMUMAB, PROVIDES A THREE-DIMENSIONAL PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION OF TUMOR LOCATION, HETEROGENEITY OF EGFR EXPRESSION, AND EXTENSION IN TO THE JAW, WHILE PANITUMUMAB- IRDYE800 PROVIDES A CORRESPONDING YET COMPLIMENTARY APPROACH FOR INTRAOPERATIVE MARGIN ASSESSMENT. THE ASSEMBLED RESEARCH TEAM IS IDEAL TO ADDRESS FOR THIS WORK IN TERMS OF EXPERIENCE, EXPERTISE, ACCESS AND STATE- OF-THE-ART IMAGING AGENTS AND FACILITIES.

PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT PERIODONTITIS IS A PREVALENT CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PERIODONTIUM THAT ULTIMATELY LEADS TO TOOTH LOSS IN ADULTS. IT IS DRIVEN BY A DYSBIOTIC MICROBIAL BIOFILM THAT COLONIZES THE GINGIVAL SULCUS AROUND TEETH. WE SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE THE LOCAL IMMUNE RESPONSE TO THE DYSBIOTIC BIOFILM THAT LEADS TO PERIODONTITIS. RECENTLY, CD69 ENGAGEMENT ON REGULATORY T CELLS WAS REPORTED TO INDUCE IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE ACTIVITIES. A NATURAL LIGAND FOR CD69-MEDIATED ACTIVATION OF REGULATORY T CELLS IS CALPROTECTIN (S100A8 COMPLEXED TO S100A9; S100A8/A9). WHEN EXPRESSED IN STRATIFIED SQUAMOUS EPITHELIA, THIS DIVALENT CATION-BINDING HETERODIMERIC COMPLEX APPEARS TO CONTRIBUTE TO INTRAEPITHELIAL ANTIMICROBIAL DEFENSE. WHEN RELEASED FROM NEUTROPHILS OR INFECTED OR DESQUAMATING KERATINOCYTES, HOWEVER, CALPROTECTIN MAY INTERACT WITH CD69+ T REGULATORY OR T HELPER 17 CELLS, ULTIMATELY SUPPRESSING THE IMMUNE RESPONSE.

USING A GLOBAL CALPROTECTIN NULL MOUSE, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT THE NET EFFECT OF CALPROTECTIN DAMPENS THE RECRUITMENT OF AN ACUTE INFLAMMATORY INFILTRATE AND LIMITS PERIODONTAL BONE DESTRUCTION IN A LIGATURE-INDUCED EXPERIMENTAL PERIODONTITIS MODEL. WE WILL NOW EXPLORE A NOVEL MURINE MODEL OF LIGATURE-INDUCED PERIODONTITIS PRIMED WITH PORPHYROMONAS GINGIVALIS (PG) GAVAGE. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT CALPROTECTIN SIGNALS THROUGH CD69 DURING THE INITIATION OF EXPERIMENTAL PERIODONTAL INFLAMMATION TO DAMPEN A DESTRUCTIVE CELLULAR INFILTRATE INTO THE GINGIVA. TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS, WE WILL: 1: CHARACTERIZE THE DIFFERENCES IN THE INFLAMMATORY CELL INFILTRATE DURING THE INITIAL STAGE OF EXPERIMENTAL PERIODONTITIS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CALPROTECTIN. 2. DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF CD69 SIGNALING TO THE RECRUITMENT OF THE INITIAL INFLAMMATORY CELL INFILTRATE IN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF CALPROTECTIN. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, WE ARE THE FIRST GROUP WITH DATA SUGGESTING THAT CALPROTECTIN DAMPENS THE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE. WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO EXPLAIN HOW CALPROTECTIN CONTRIBUTES TO RECRUITMENT OF INNATE IMMUNE CELLS IN THE GINGIVA BY AFFECTING GLOBAL CD69 SIGNALING IN VIVO USING A MURINE MODEL OF PERIODONTITIS. WE WILL CHARACTERIZE HOW CALPROTECTIN AND CD69 SIGNALING IN TREG CELLS SHAPES IMMUNOSUPPRESSION ON OTHER EFFECTOR T CELLS. ULTIMATELY, WE WILL ELUCIDATE WHETHER CALPROTECTIN VIA CD69 GLOBAL SIGNALING IN THE GINGIVA DRIVES EITHER PROTECTION OF PERIODONTAL TISSUES OR DESTRUCTION OF ALVEOLAR BONE.

AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD THE GOAL, THIS R21 STUDY PURSUES THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES: (1) FOCUS GROUP WITH A COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD, (2) ASSESSMENT OF THE LOCAL DENTAL SERVICE ENVIRONMENT, (3) CONTENT DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATION AND NAVIGATION MATERIALS, (4) DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPUTERIZED TAILORING SYSTEM, (5) DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOCOLS FOR CHW TRAINING AND MONITORING, AND (6) PILOT TESTING AND EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM. EACH STEP WILL BE GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH (CBPR). THE PRODUCTS FROM THESE INITIAL ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE A CONTENT LIBRARY OF ORAL HEALTH EDUCATION MATERIALS AND LOCAL RESOURCES FOR DENTAL CARE, A COMPUTERIZED TAILORING SYSTEM, AND A PROTOCOL FOR CHW TRAINING AND MONITORING. PILOT TESTING WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH 40 OLDER KOREAN AMERICANS WHO MEET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (HAVING LEP AND NO USE OF PREVENTIVE DENTAL SERVICES IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS). EACH PARTICIPANT WILL BE ASSIGNED TO ONE OF FOUR TRAINED CHWS AND WILL RECEIVE A PERSONALIZED ONE-ON-ONE EDUCATION SESSION (30 MINUTES, USING AN IPAD). THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL CONTACT PARTICIPANTS THREE MONTHS LATER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAD USED ANY PREVENTIVE DENTAL SERVICES SINCE THE EDUCATION SESSION. USING AN ADAPTIVE DESIGN, A CHW-LED PERSONALIZED NAVIGATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WILL BE PROVIDED TO NON-USERS. THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA FROM BOTH THE PARTICIPANTS AND THE CHWS, INCLUDING QUANTITATIVE DATA ON PARTICIPATION RATE AND SATISFACTION WITH THE PROGRAM AND QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK. THE FINDINGS WILL FORM A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR A LARGER, DEFINITIVE STUDY WITH A CLINICAL TRIAL (E.G., R01) TO IDENTIFY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND PROVIDE A TRANSLATIONAL MODEL FOR REDUCING BARRIERS TO PREVENTIVE DENTAL SERVICES FOR DIVERSE LEP GROUPS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure

VASCULARIZATION AND BONE FORMATION. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, IN THIS PROJECT WE PROPOSE TO CONSTRUCT A NEW VASCULATURE-LIKE CHANNELS INTERNAL STRUCTURE AND ADD MANGANESE DIOXIDE (MNO2) HOLLOW NANOPARTICLES IN A POROUS BETA-TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE (B-TCP) SCAFFOLD TO FACILITATE NEW BLOOD VESSEL GROWTH AND STIMULATE OSTEOGENESIS. THIS STRATEGY HARNESSES THE NEW MIMICKING VASCULATURE-LIKE CHANNELS TO STIMULATE CELL RECRUITMENT AND PROMOTE THE INVASION OF NEW BLOOD VESSELS, AND UTILIZES THE NEW INORGANIC MN-CONTAINING NANOPARTICLES TO PROMOTE OSTEOGENESIS. SPECIFICALLY, A TEMPLATE-CASTING TECHNIQUE COMBINING 3D PRINTING WILL BE EMPLOYED TO DEVELOP VASCULATURE-LIKE CHANNELED POROUS MNO2/B-TCP SCAFFOLDS. THE CONCENTRATIONS OF MNO2 NANOPARTICLES IN THE B-TCP, THE OPTIMAL CHANNEL SIZE OF THE VASCULATURE-LIKE CHANNELS, AND THE IN VIVO CELL INFILTRATION, TISSUE BIOCOMPATIBILITY, AND VASCULARIZATION OF THE NEW SCAFFOLD WILL BE FULLY INVESTIGATED. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE WILL PURSUE THE FOLLOWING THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1: INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF MNO2 NANOPARTICLES ON THE MECHANICAL, PHYSICOCHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF POROUS B-TCP SCAFFOLDS. AIM 2: INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF 3D CHANNELS ON THE MECHANICAL, PHYSICOCHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF POROUS MNO2/B-TCP SCAFFOLDS.

AN EFFECTIVE CHEMOPREVENTION METHOD IMPLEMENTED BEFORE AN INVASIVE CANCER DEVELOPS IS NEEDED TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF SCCHN; HOWEVER, CURRENTLY NO SUCH TREATMENT REGIMEN IS AVAILABLE. THUS, THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEW COMPOUNDS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING SCCHN CARCINOGENESIS IS WARRANTED. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL DEVELOP FLLL12 AS A THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR THE CHEMOPREVENTION OF SCCHN. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT FLLL12 HAS IC50 VALUES IN A HIGHLY SELECTIVE RANGE (<1 \u039cM AGAINST MOST SCCHN CELL LINES AND 0.35 \u039cM AGAINST A PREMALIGNANT ORAL CANCER CELL LINE).

BY EMPLOYING PROMOTER DELETION-MUTATION, WE WILL IDENTIFY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR(S) THAT INHIBIT EGFR AND AKT TRANSCRIPTS. AIM 3: ANALYZE THE IN VIVO EFFICACY OF FLLL12 AS A CHEMOPREVENTION AGENT IN A CARCINOGEN-INDUCED ORAL CARCINOGENESIS MODEL.

THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF \u2018NORMAL-RANGE\u2019 FACIAL VARIATION HAS BEEN OF GREAT INTEREST IN THE LAST DECADE AS IT HAS PARTICULAR IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ETIOLOGY OF MALFORMATIONS IN THE FACE RELATED TO DISEASE. RECENTLY, AN ADVANCEMENT IN PHENOTYPING TOWARDS THE USE OF QUASI-LANDMARKS APPLIED TO 3D FACIAL SCANS HAS ENRICHED OUR KNOWLEDGE WITH NEW GENETIC LINKS TIED TO THE HUMAN FACE. HOWEVER, THESE AND OTHER GENETIC SIGNALS MAY POTENTIALLY BE CLOUDED BY NOT KNOWING FACIAL SKELETAL INFORMATION UNDERNEATH THE SKIN. A COMPLETE EXAMINATION OF HUMAN FACIAL STRUCTURE WOULD BE TO INSPECT BOTH THE OUTER SOFT TISSUE STRUCTURE AND THE INNER HARD TISSUE BONE CONCURRENTLY, INCLUDING THE DEPTH OF TISSUE IN THEIR CONNECTION. FROM OUR EVER-EXPANDING LIST OF CRANIOFACIAL CANDIDATE VARIANTS/GENES, IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO ACCURATELY CLASSIFY THEIR SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE FACE\u2019S DEVELOPMENT THROUGH ACCURATE LANDMARK PLACEMENT, AND CORRECTION OF COMPETING STRUCTURES WITHIN THE FACIAL CONSTRUCT.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS AND REDUCE BARRIERS CURRENTLY DISSUADING FQHC PCPS FROM PROVIDING FV DURING WELL-CHILD VISITS. THE OVERALL RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION WILL BE SPECIFIC WORKFLOW SUGGESTIONS AND RESULTING RESOURCE AND COST DATA, AS WELL AS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO IMPLEMENTATION, THAT WILL ALLOW PHYSICIANS\u2019 OFFICES TO MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW TO INTEGRATE FV IN THEIR PEDIATRIC WELL-CHILD VISITS BASED ON THEIR OWN UNIQUE PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS.

HOWEVER, THE PRECISE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING IRF4- MEDIATED ONCOGENESIS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT IRF4 IS CRITICAL FOR SURVIVAL OF VIRUS (EBV, HTLV1)-TRANSFORMED CELLS, AND ITS DEPLETION CAUSES APOPTOSIS, AT LEAST THROUGH TRANSCRIPTIONAL UPREGULATION OF THE ONCOGENIC MIRNA MIR-155 AND THE ADAPTOR PROTEIN LIMD1 THAT IN TURN PARTICIPATES IN EBV LATENT TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 1 (LMP1) SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AND IS REQUIRED FOR OXIDATIVE STRESS-INDUCED AUTOPHAGY, AMONGST MANY OTHER IRF4 TRANSCRIPTIONAL TARGETS. WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT IRF4 IS ACTIVATED THROUGH C-SRC- MEDIATED TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION DOWNSTREAM OF LMP1 SIGNALING, IN EBV-TRANSFORMED CELLS, WITH THE AID OF SEVERAL UNBIASED \u201cSTATE-OF-THE-ART\u201d HIGH THROUGHPUT TECHNIQUES INCLUDING PHOSPHOTYROSINE PROTEOMICS, AND UBIQUITINOMICS. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE COLLECTED SEVERAL LINES OF EVIDENCE IN THESE STUDIES SHOWING THAT IRF4 IS UBIQUITINATED WITH K63-LINKED UBIQUITIN CHAINS, AND THAT APOPTOSIS INDUCES A SMALLER SIZE OF IRF4, WHICH MAY BE A CASPASE-CLEAVED PRODUCT AND MAY REPRESENT A DOMINANT NEGATIVE MUTANT LACKING THE DNA-BINDING ACTIVITY.

SUCH INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES ARE BEING USED TO ELUCIDATE HOW DEVELOPING CRANIOFACIAL TISSUES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT INTERACT TO CREATE CRANIOFACIAL FORM AND FUNCTION. THE PROPOSED PRESENTATIONS WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS ON HOW THESE PROCESSES DRIVE THE DIVERSITY OF CRANIOFACIAL STRUCTURES, AND HOW MANY DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE VERTEBRATE HEAD HAVE EVOLVED.  INVITED PRESENTATIONS BY NEW AND ESTABLISHED RESEARCHERS WILL DISCUSS NEW FINDINGS IN CRANIOFACIAL MORPHOGENESIS AND TISSUE REGENERATION, WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF MECHANICAL AND BIOELECTRIC SIGNALING IN CRANIOFACIAL DEVELOPMENT AND TISSUE REGENERATION. THE MEETING WILL ALSO FEATURE SESSIONS ON CELL SIGNALLING, CLINICAL GENETICS, SENSE ORGANS, NEW ANIMAL MODELS OF CRANIOFACIAL DISORDERS, AND ON NOVEL TISSUE ENGINEERING STRATEGIES FOR REGENERATIVE CRANIOFACIAL TISSUE REPAIR. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE INTERACTIONS OF BASIC SCIENCE RESEARCHERS, CLINICIAN SCIENTISTS, BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERS AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGISTS OF DIVERSE EXPERTISE, IN ORDER TO FOSTER STIMULATING DISCUSSIONS AND PRODUCTIVE NEW COLLABORATIONS IN A HIGHLY COLLEGIAL ATMOSPHERE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "RI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "234b0bf7-6dda-7f84-f2b9-918a2cc6cba3-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R13DE031494_7529"}, {"internal_id": 137716042, "Award ID": "R13DE031170", "Award Amount": 8602.31, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-06-28", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "ORAL MICROBIOME: BEYOND BACTERIA - THIS R13 PROPOSAL SEEKS SUPPORT FOR FORSYTH SYMPOSIUM 2021 \u201cORAL MICROBIOME: BEYOND BACTERIA\u201d AT THE FORSYTH INSTITUTE ON OCTOBER 28-29, 2021. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE SYMPOSIUM IS TO PROMOTE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ORAL MICROBIOME FROM A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE. ORAL MICROBIOME IS COMPOSED OF DIVERSE BACTERIAL SPECIES, FUNGAL AND VIRAL (BACTERIOPHAGE) COMPONENTS, AS WELL AS RECENTLY IDENTIFIED NANO-SIZED PARASITIC CANDIDATE PHYLA RADIATION (CPR) ORGANISMS. EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF ORAL MICROBIOME-RELATED DISEASES CALLS FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF THE ORAL MICROBIOTA ON HOST HEALTH AND DISEASE, WHICH REQUIRES A HOLISTIC VIEW OF INTRA- AND CROSS-KINGDOM INTERACTIONS AMONG DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE ORAL MICROBIOME (INCLUDING BACTERIA, FUNGI, PHAGES AND CPR ORGANISMS), AS WELL AS MICROBIAL-HOST INTERACTION. THE SYMPOSIUM WILL BRING TOGETHER A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS WITH DIVERSE RESEARCH BACKGROUNDS IN ORAL MICROBIOME (INCLUDING ORAL BACSTERIOME, MYCOBIOME, PHAGEOME AND CPR) AND DIFFERENT CAREER STAGES TO SHARE THEIR RESEARCH AND IDEAS.

THE GRC WILL BE THE TENTH IN A SERIES OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL BIENNIAL CONFERENCES, AND IT WILL BE PRECEDED AN ASSOCIATED GRS, A PRE-MEETING EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED TO AND ORGANIZED BY TRAINEES. THE GRC AND GRS WILL COVER BROAD BASIC AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH TOPICS WITH THE THEME OF \u201cCARTILAGE BIOLOGY, STRUCTURE, AND FUNCTION: FROM DEVELOPMENT TO REGENERATION\u201d. THE GRC ON CARTILAGE BIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OWES ITS SUCCESS TO THREE MAJOR PRINCIPLES. FIRST, IT IS THE ONLY CONFERENCE THAT BRINGS TOGETHER BASIC-SCIENCE RESEARCHERS, CLINICIANS-SCIENTISTS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERS, AND COVERS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CARTILAGE BIOLOGY, CARTILAGE PATHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES RELEVANT TO CARTILAGE RESEARCH. SECOND, AND EXEMPLIFYING THE GRC TRADITION, THE CONFERENCE EMPHASIZES FORWARD THINKING, UNPUBLISHED CUTTING- EDGE FINDINGS, STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGIES AND OPEN DISCUSSIONS. IT ALTERNATES FORMAL PRESENTATIONS WITH POSTER SESSIONS AND INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS, AND LIMITS ATTENDANCE TO 200 PARTICIPANTS TO PROMOTE COLLEGIAL INTERACTIONS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRODUCTIVE COLLABORATIONS. THIRD, IT IS OPEN TO RESEARCHERS AT ALL CAREER STAGES AND ENCOURAGES MENTORING, NETWORKING, AND COLLABORATIONS AMONG ASPIRANT, YOUNG AND SENIOR INVESTIGATORS. THIS PRINCIPLE IS EMPHASIZED WITH THE INCLUSION OF A GRS, WHICH HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST. THE GRC/GRS ON CARTILAGE BIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY COVERS A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS CARTILAGE IS NOT ONLY THE EARLIEST SKELETAL TISSUE THAT SUPPORTS SKELETAL DEVELOPMENT FROM EMBRYOS TO ADULTHOOD, BUT ALSO SERVES AN ESSENTIAL SKELETAL COMPONENT OF A FUNCTIONAL ADULT SKELETAL SYSTEM. IN THIS REGARD, DISEASES THAT RESULT IN CARTILAGE MALFORMATION OR DEGENERATION SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE LIFESPAN AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION. THE GRC WILL HIGHLIGHT RECENT ADVANCES AND CHALLENGES IN UNDERSTANDING CARTILAGE BIOLOGY AND DISEASES. ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS AND TALENTED NEW INVESTIGATORS WILL REPORT AND DISCUSS THEIR MOST RECENT EXCITING FINDINGS ACCORDING TO THIS THEME AND WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE REMAINING CHALLENGES TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF CARTILAGE BIOLOGY, DISEASE, AND TRANSLATIONAL APPROACHES.

IN HUMANS, INNATE IMMUNE MEMORY IS IMPORTANT FOR HOST DEFENSE AGAINST INFECTIONS, AND MAY ENHANCE ANTI-TUMOR IMMUNITY, BUT CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO PATHOGENESIS IN INFLAMMATORY AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. THE EMERGENCE OF NOVEL TYPES OF IMMUNOTHERAPY IS HAVING A PROFOUND IMPACT ON DISEASE OUTCOMES IN SEVERAL MAJOR PATHOLOGIES SUCH AS CANCER, AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES AND EVEN SEVERE INFECTIONS. HOWEVER, THE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC RESEARCH HAS LARGELY FOCUSED ON TARGETING ADAPTIVE IMMUNE CELLS (E.G., CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS, CAR-T CELLS, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES), WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION TO INNATE IMMUNE CELLS. THIS CONFERENCE INTENDS TO CHANGE THIS BY SERVING AS AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM TO HIGHLIGHT INNATE IMMUNE PROCESSES OF RELEVANCE TO IMMUNOTHERAPIES. THIS MEETING IS A UNIQUE PLATFORM, IN WHICH RESEARCHERS FROM SEVERAL IMPORTANT FIELDS (IMMUNOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, CANCER BIOLOGY, INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND PHYSIOLOGY, CLINICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES) WILL BE ABLE TO INTERACT AND EXCHANGE IDEAS, METHODS AND BUILD COLLABORATIONS: THIS IS EMERGING AS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AREAS IN IMMUNOLOGY, AND THE PROPOSED KEYSTONE SYMPOSIUM HAS THE CHANCE TO GIVE A STRONG IMPETUS TO THIS NOVEL FIELD OF RESEARCH.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "26eb2b26-f47e-582b-f630-555df416109f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R13AI167432_7529"}, {"internal_id": 152369885, "Award ID": "R03OD034502", "Award Amount": 312973.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-09-20", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "DATA-DRIVEN SEARCH OF COMMON FUND DATA SETS FOR BETTER DISCOVERABILITY AND NOVEL META-ANALYSIS - PROJECT SUMMARY  NIH COMMON FUND (CF) PROGRAMS HAVE PRODUCED A NUMBER OF UNIQUE AND HIGH-VALUE DATA SETS.

THE REALIZATION THAT DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES CRITICAL TO BRAIN DEVELOPMENT ARE ALSO DEREGULATED IN CANCER HAS PROVIDED NEW HOPE FOR UNDERSTANDING AND TREATING BRAIN TUMORS. INDEED, SINGLE CELL-RNASEQ ANALYSES HAVE FURTHER DEMONSTRATED THE ROLE OF DEFECTS IN LINEAGE DETERMINATION FOR PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS. TO DISCOVER NOVEL DRIVERS OF TUMORIGENESIS, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE FUNCTION OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) GENOME FOLDING IN PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS.

WHILE THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST IN ELUCIDATING THE FUNCTION OF 3D GENOME ARCHITECTURE DURING DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES AND IN CANCER, HOW THE 3D GENOME IS ORGANIZED IN DIFFERENT PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS AND ITS ROLES IN TUMOR FORMATION AND PROGRESSION ARE UNKNOWN.

TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS, WE WILL COMPREHENSIVELY INTERROGATE THE GENOMES OF PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS FOR NON-CODING VARIANTS THAT MAY AFFECT 3D GENOME FOLDING.

IN CONTRAST TO ADULT CANCER WITH MANY GENETIC MUTATIONS, MOST PEDIATRIC CANCERS HAVE FEW GENETIC MUTATIONS. INSTEAD, RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FUSION RNAS AND THEIR ENCODED PROTEINS MAY DRIVE TUMORIGENESIS IN CHILDREN. FUSION RNAS ARE GENERATED BY EXONS FROM TWO GENES. WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE FUSION ONCOPROTEINS IN CHILDHOOD CANCERS CONSORTIUM, MORE FUSION PROTEINS ARE BEING FOUND AND STUDIED. HOWEVER, A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS IN PEDIATRIC CANCER REMAINS ELUSIVE, MAINLY DUE TO THREE UNSOLVED CHALLENGES. FIRST, CURRENT STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON MRNA-DERIVED FUSION PROTEINS AND HAVE NOT EXPLORED LONG NONCODING RNA-DERIVED FUSION TRANSCRIPTS (LNC-FUSIONS) AND THEIR ENCODED PROTEINS IN PEDIATRIC CANCER; ALTHOUGH LNC-FUSIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ADULT CANCER TO REGULATE ANTI-TUMOR IMMUNITY. LONG NONCODING RNAS (LNCRNAS) ARE LONG TRANSCRIPTS OF AT LEAST 200 NUCLEOTIDES THAT CANNOT ENCODE PROTEIN. LNCRNAS LARGELY OUTNUMBER MRNAS AND PLAY CRITICAL ROLES IN VARIOUS CANCERS. THEREFORE, A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION OF MECHANISMS DRIVING PEDIATRIC CANCER IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT EXPANDING THE STUDY OF FUSION PROTEINS TO INCLUDE LNCRNA-FUSIONS. SECOND, EXISTING LNC-FUSION DETECTION METHODS CANNOT EXPLORE LNC-FUSIONS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM NOVEL LNCRNAS. DUE TO HIGH DISEASE-SPECIFICITY, MOST LNCRNAS HAVE NOT BEEN ANNOTATED IN PEDIATRIC CANCER. THIRD, FUSION RNAS, INCLUDING LNC-FUSIONS, MAY BE FORMED BY ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS, SUCH AS CHROMOSOME REARRANGEMENT OR ABERRANT SPLICING EVENTS. THESE ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS COMPLICATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF GENETIC MECHANISMS AND THUS TREATMENT.  THE LARGE AMOUNT OF MULTI-OMICS DATA FROM VARIOUS COMMON FUND SOURCES ENABLES US TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES IN PEDIATRIC CANCER. PREVIOUSLY, WE HAD DEVELOPED COMPUTATIONAL METHODS TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE LNCRNAS FOR HUMAN DISEASES AND DEVELOPMENT.

OUR RECENT STUDIES USING NEWLY DEVELOPED MACHINE LEARNING-BASED FEATURE ENGINEERING APPROACHES AND CONDUCTED IN A PAN-CANCER STUDY ACROSS 12 CANCER TYPES SHOWED THAT BIOLOGICALLY CONSTRAINED FEATURES (NAMED HEREIN INVARIANT FEATURES) ARE UNIVERSAL IN DISEASE AND CAN BE USED TO CLASSIFY INDIVIDUAL CANCERS. IMPORTANTLY, WE ALSO SHOW THAT INVARIANT FEATURES CAN BE USED TO BUILD DE NOVO BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS AND DISCOVER NETWORK HUBS THAT CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY UTILIZED TO INFER THE EXPRESSION OF ASSOCIATED GENES. AS SUCH, INVARIANT FEATURES CAN ACT AS INFORMATION ENCODERS. USING INFORMATION FROM DRUG REPURPOSING HUB WE SHOW THAT THESE HUB GENES ARE ALSO DRUG TARGETS.

THIS, IN TURN, AFFECTS THE CLEARANCE OF WASTE AND SS- AMYLOID FROM THE BRAIN. WE TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS USING OUR INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS BIOLOGY APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES SKULL DEVELOPMENT WITH INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE, CSF FLOW, AND THE BRAIN'S GLYMPHATIC AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEMS. IN AIM 1, WE USE TWO GENETIC MOUSE MODELS FOR CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS TO TEST IF IMPAIRED GLYMPHATIC (I.E. CSF) INFLUX AND EFFLUX IMPEDE THE CLEARANCE OF SS-AMYLOID OLIGOMERS INJECTED INTO THE BRAIN. NEXT, WE TEST IF THE CLEARANCE OF SS- AMYLOID PLAQUES IS REDUCED BY GENERATING MOUSE MODELS FOR CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS AND AMYLOID DEPOSITION THAT EXPRESS FIVE MUTATIONS FOUND IN FAMILIAL ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. WE ALSO TEST A MECHANISTIC BASIS FOR GLYMPHATIC DYSFUNCTION IN CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS, BY EXAMINING IF THE POLARIZATION OF AQUAPORIN-4 WATER CHANNELS TO GLIAL ENDFEET IS PERTURBED. THESE GLIAL (I.E. GLYMPHATIC) WATER CHANNELS FACILITATE CSF FLOW THROUGH PERIVASCULAR SPACES IN THE BRAIN, AND THEREFORE WASTE EXCHANGE BETWEEN CSF AND BRAIN INTERSTITIAL FLUID. IN AIM 2, WE TEST WHETHER MENINGEAL LYMPHATIC DEFICITS AFFECT WASTE DRAINAGE TO THE CERVICAL LYMPH NODES. WE ALSO EXPLORE A MOLECULAR MECHANISM FOR MENINGEAL LYMPHATIC DEFICITS BY TESTING IF VEGF-C EXPRESSION AND THE ACTIVATION OF VEGFR3 RECEPTOR SIGNALING IS AFFECTED. COLLECTIVELY, OUR NOVEL SYSTEM AND APPROACHES CAN DISSECT INTERLOCKING MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH NORMAL SKULL DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS CSF FLOW, BRAIN WASTE CLEARANCE PATHWAYS, AND MENINGEAL LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE.

ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY PAIN CAUSED BY A TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT DISORDER (TMJD) AND OTHER CHRONIC ORAL AND FACIAL DISEASES, THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. OUR PREVIOUS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT LIPID MEDIATORS DERIVED FROM OMEGA-3 POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS SUCH AS RESOLVIN E1 (RVE1) WERE EFFECTIVE IN INHIBITING INFLAMMATORY PAIN BY REGULATING TRPV1. HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER RVE1 CAN INHIBIT TMJ PAIN IN THE TRIGEMINAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, THE ROLE OF ITS RECEPTOR CHEMR23, AND ITS RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL TRANSLATION. WE FOUND FROM PRELIMINARY DATA THAT CHEMR23 IS CO-EXPRESSED WITH TRPV1 USING THE ATAC-SEQ DATABASE, RVE1 WAS DECREASED IN THE TMJ-CFA MODEL USING ELISA DETECTION, AND RVE1 CAN REDUCE TMJ PAIN USING THE BITING FORCE METHOD. BASED ON THIS, WE SUGGEST THAT A RVE1/CHEMR23 SIGNALING PATHWAY RESOLVES TMJ PAIN BY SUPPRESSING TRPV1 FUNCTION. IN AIM1, WE PREDICT THAT THE RVE1/CHEMR23 PATHWAY WILL BE DOWNREGULATED DURING THE TMJ-CFA MODEL.

WE WILL MEASURE HOW MUCH CHEMR23 IS EXPRESSED IN TMJ-INNERVATED TG IN THE TMJ-CFA MODEL USING FLOW CYTOMETRY. IN AIM2, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISM OF PAIN SUPPRESSION THROUGH CHEMR23/TRPV1 THROUGH ANIMAL BEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENTS. TO KNOW THE RVE1 CAN BLOCK THE TRPV1-INDUCED PAIN IN TG, WE WILL CAUSE ACUTE TRIGEMINAL PAIN BY INJECTING TRPV1 AGONIST CAPSAICIN INTO THE WHISKER PAD.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE THE DENTIN-PULP INTERFACE IN YOUNG AND OLD RODENT MOLARS TO QUALITATIVELY DETERMINE HOW THE REGENERATIVE CAPACITY OF THE DENTIN-PULP COMPLEX CHANGES WITH AGE. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AGE-RELATED CHANGES TO THE DP MESENCHYME, VASCULATURE, AND INNERVATION ALTER THE SECRETION AND AVAIL- ABILITY OF BIOACTIVE PROTEINS IN DENTIN (BPID) AND THAT PULPAL SENESCENCE, IN COMBINATION WITH REDUCED ACCESS TO BPID, REDUCES TOOTH VITALITY WITH AGE.

DESPITE IMPROVEMENT IN TREATMENTS, NSCLP IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL, PSYCHOSOCIAL AND FINANCIAL BURDENS TO AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES. NSCLP IS COMPLEX, CAUSED BY GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, AND THEIR INTERACTIONS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ~25% OF THE GENETIC LIABILITY FOR NSCLP HAS BEEN UNCOVERED; HOWEVER, MOST OF THE IDENTIFIED VARIANTS REFLECT COMMON, MODEST RISK-VARIANTS OFTEN LOCATED IN NONCODING REGIONS OF THE GENOME.

OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE MECHANISM OF AGE-RELATED BONE LOSS IN PD TO DEVELOP MECHANISTICALLY BASED THERAPIES OF PD BONE LOSS. A POTENTIAL FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PD BONE LOSS IS THE ACCUMULATION OF SENESCENT CELLS. SENESCENT CELL ACCUMULATION IN TISSUES IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS A DRIVER OF AGE-ASSOCIATED DISORDERS.

FISETIN IS A RECENTLY CHARACTERIZED SENOLYTIC WITHOUT OBSERVABLE ADVERSE EFFECTS AND IS BEING EVALUATED IN CLINICAL TRIALS TARGETING PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS HALLMARKED BY SENESCENT CELL BURDEN.  OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES USING THE LIGATURE-INDUCED PD (LIP) MODEL SHOWED THAT LIP INDUCES INITIAL RAPID BONE RESORPTION FOLLOWED BY A RAPID RECOVERY DUE TO BONE FORMATION BY DAY 14 IN YOUNG MICE (2.5 MONTHS). IN CONTRAST, SIGNIFICANT BONE LOSS REMAINED AT DAY 14 IN MATURE MICE (8-12 MONTHS). ALSO, MATURE MICE SHOWED GREATER BONE VOLUME LOSS COMPARED TO YOUNG MICE, INDICATING THE INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LIP-INDUCED BONE LOSS IN MATURE MICE. FURTHERMORE, BONE FORMATION RATE IN MATURE MICE WITH LIP WAS LOWER THAN YOUNG MICE, SUGGESTING THAT DIMINISHED BONE FORMATION RATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LIP-INDUCED BONE LOSS IN MATURE MICE. WE FOUND INCREASES IN EXPRESSION LEVELS OF SENESCENCE MARKER GENES IN PERIODONTAL TISSUE OF MATURE MICE BEFORE PD INDUCTION, SUGGESTING THAT ACCUMULATION OF SENESCENT CELLS IN THE TISSUE INCREASE THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LIP-INDUCED BONE LOSS IN MATURE MICE. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT ACCUMULATION OF THE SENESCENT CELLS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR INHIBITING BONE RECOVERY AND FOR INCREASING BONE LOSS SUSCEPTIBILITY IN THE PATHOLOGY OF PD BONE LOSS, AND THAT SENOLYTIC TREATMENT WILL IMPROVES THE PD-DRIVEN BONE LOSS.

THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THE PROPOSED STUDIES IS THAT IFN- STIMULATED SG-MSCS, THROUGH STAT1 SIGNALING, ARE PRO-INFLAMMATORY AND THAT RUXOLITINIB INHIBITS THIS PRO- INFLAMMATORY PHENOTYPE AND ULTIMATELY REDUCES SG INFLAMMATION AND RESTORES SALIVA PRODUCTION IN SJD MOUSE MODELS. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS HYPOTHESIS IS BASED ON OUR NEW DATA SHOWING RUXOLITINIB ABOLISHES IFN-INDUCED MSC ACTIVATION AND REDUCES MHCII UPREGULATION IN VITRO THROUGH STAT1.

THE ETIOLOGY OF NCS IS LARGELY UNKNOWN; HOWEVER, FINDINGS GENERATED BY GENOMIC TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEGUN TO NARROW THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP. USING THE SPECIMEN RESOURCES OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS CONSORTIUM AND THE NATIONAL BIRTH DEFECTS PREVENTION STUDY, WE SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCTED THE FIRST TWO GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWAS)S FOR SAGITTAL NCS (SNCS) AND METOPIC NCS (MNCS), PERFORMED NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS) OF CANDIDATE LOCI FOR SNCS AND MNCS, AND COMPLETED WHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING (WES) OF MORE THAN 240 CASE-PARENT TRIOS, MULTIPLEX, AND/OR MULTIGENERATIONAL FAMILIES WITH NCS.

YET, THOUGH BACTERIA IN THE ORAL MICROBIOME HAVE BEEN STUDIED FOR DECADES, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PHAGES SHAPE THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND THEREBY MAY PLAY A ROLE IN HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE. IN THIS APPLICATION, A BACTERIAL PATHOGEN THAT HAS BEEN \u2013 AND CONTINUES TO BE - INTENSIVELY STUDIED FOR ITS ROLE AS KEYSTONE SPECIES AND DRIVER IN PERIODONTAL DISEASE, PORPHYROMONAS GINGIVALIS (PG), IS DEVELOPED AS A MODEL FOR STUDYING BACTERIA-PHAGE INTERACTIONS IN THE ORAL MICROBIOME. TO DATE, NO PHAGES ABLE TO INFECT OR KILL PG HAVE BEEN ISOLATED, NOR HAVE PG GENOMES BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED FOR EVIDENCE OF CHRONICALLY INFECTING FORMS OF PHAGES (\u201cPROPHAGES\u201d). THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS THAT PG ISOLATES HARBOR DIVERSE PHAGES INTEGRATED INTO THEIR GENOMES AS PROPHAGES, AND THAT THESE PROPHAGES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER THE ECOLOGY OF PG IN THE ORAL MICROBIOME. TWO COMPLEMENTARY AIMS, PROVIDING BOTH BREADTH AND DEPTH OF INSIGHT INTO THE ROLES OF PHAGES IN THE ECOLOGY OF PG, ARE USED TO ADDRESS THIS HYPOTHESIS. IN AIM 1, THE GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY AND FUNCTIONALLY CHARACTERIZE PROPHAGES ENCODED IN GENOMES OF PG. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY OBTAINING NEW ISOLATES OF PG FROM VOLUNTEERS WITH PERIODONTAL DISEASE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE PG GENOMES, AND BIOINFORMATICALLY IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERIZING PROPHAGES IN THESE GENOMES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THEIR CAPACITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO BACTERIAL VIRULENCE AND INTRASPECIES COMPETITION. IN AIM 2, THE GOAL IS TO DETERMINE THE RECEPTORS USED BY PROPHAGES TO INFECT THEIR PG HOSTS. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY ESTABLISHING MODEL SYSTEMS OF PG PHAGES AND USING CULTIVATION BASED METHODS TO IDENTIFY THEIR HOST RANGE DETERMINANTS. COMPLETION OF THESE AIMS WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST VIEW OF THE PHYLOGENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF PG PHAGES, INSIGHTS INTO THEIR HOST RANGES, AND THE FIRST IDENTIFICATION OF RECEPTORS THAT THEY USE TO INFECT THEIR PG HOSTS. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY WITH THE KNOWLEDGEBASE AND TOOLS NECESSARY TO TEST HYPOTHESES (IN VITRO, IN VIVO, AND IN LONGITUDINAL AND CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES) THAT ADDRESS HOW INTERACTIONS WITH PHAGES SHAPE PG GENOMES, PHYSIOLOGY, POPULATION DYNAMICS, INTER-SPECIES AND INTER-KINGDOM INTERACTIONS, AND ROLE IN PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND ITS PROGRESSION. UNCOVERING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF HOW PHAGE-BACTERIA INTERACTIONS ARE STRUCTURED IN THE ORAL MICROBIOME WILL ALSO LAY AN ESSENTIAL FOUNDATION FOR THE RATIONAL DESIGN OF ROBUST, SAFE, AND EFFICIENT PHAGE-BASED THERAPEUTICS FOR USE IN ORAL AND SYSTEMIC DISEASE INCLUDING PERIODONTAL DISEASE.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f94a8263-c1eb-718b-03c5-bb8a878692fd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R03DE030987_7529"}, {"internal_id": 138796373, "Award ID": "R03DE030985", "Award Amount": 319000.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-30", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "EPIGENETIC REGULATORY ROLES OF MLL4 IN PALATE DEVELOPMENT - PROJECT SUMMARY  EACH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES, MORE THAN 2,500 BABIES ARE BORN WITH A CLEFT PALATE (CP).

PULPLESS TEETH CAN LOSE THEIR FUNCTIONS TO SENSE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND MAINTAIN DENTIN REGENERATION, AND THE SYNTHETIC MATERIALS HAVE SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES SUCH AS BACTERIAL LEAKAGE INTO THE DENTAL PULP, POOR COHESIVE STRENGTH, DISCOLORATION OF TOOTH, AND LONG SETTING TIME. AS AN ALTERNATIVE, VITAL PULP THERAPY (VPT), WHICH IS DEFINED AS A RESTORATIVE DENTAL TREATMENT THAT AIMS TO PRESERVE AND MAINTAIN PULP TISSUE, IS BENEFICIAL FOR YOUNG PATIENTS WHO HAVE HIGH HEALING CAPACITY FOR PULP REGENERATION. POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL VPT AND PULP REGENERATION IS INCREASING DUE TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS (MSCS) THAT CAN DIFFERENTIATE INTO SPECIALIZED CELLS. HOWEVER, THE TRANSPLANTATION OF MSCS INCURS HIGH COSTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EX VIVO CELL EXPANSION. CONSEQUENTLY, A CELL HOMING STRATEGY WHICH RECRUITS ENDOGENOUS DENTAL PULP STEM CELLS (DPSCS) IS THE EFFECTIVE APPROACH IN ENDODONTICS.

HOWEVER, RECENT FINDINGS INDICATE THAT RELEASE OF TITANIUM FROM IMPLANTS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE RAMPANT INFLAMMATORY BONE DESTRUCTION OBSERVED IN PERI-IMPLANTITIS.

PRIMARILY, THIS IS DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF AN EFFICIENT GENETIC SYSTEM TO ALLOW GENETIC MANIPULATIONS OF THE F. ALOCIS GENOME.

WOUND HEALING IN TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM) CHALLENGE THE OUTCOMES OF THE TREATMENTS FOR BONE REGENERATION. THE RELATED MORBIDITY AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BONE HEALING FAILURES ARE CONSIDERABLE AND INCREASING. RECENT DISCOVERIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS TIGHTLY LINKED TO BONE PHYSIOLOGY AND THAT MSC DERIVED EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES (EVS) PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE IN IMMUNOMODULATION OF BONE REPAIR. WHILE RECOMBINANT HUMAN BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 2 (RHBMP2) MEDIATED BONE REGENERATION IS WELL ESTABLISHED, THE CHALLENGES OF CONTROLLING INFLAMMATION ARISING FROM RHBMP2 USAGE IS EXACERBATED IN THE PRESENCE OF IMMUNOMODULATING SYSTEMIC DISEASES SUCH AS T2DM PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAP THAT LIMIT CLINICAL OUTCOMES. BASED ON PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF INFLAMMATION INFORMED MSC EV MICRORNA (MIRNA) COMPOSITION AND EFFECTS ON IMMUNOMODULATION AND BONE REGENERATION, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A DUAL DELIVERY OF ENGINEERED MSC EVS WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES AND RHBMP2 USING A COMBINATORIAL DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH SELF-ASSEMBLING LEUCINE ZIPPER (LZ) PEPTIDE-BASED HYDROGELS AND ALGINATE BEADS CAN ENHANCE BONE HEALING IN T2DM. WE PROPOSE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL TEST OUR PRELIMINARY DATA DRIVEN HYPOTHESIS THAT A SUBSET OF ALTERED MIRNAS IN PRECONDITIONED MSC EVS CONTRIBUTES TO THE ENHANCED IMMUNOMODULATORY FUNCTION OF THE INFLAMMATORY PRECONDITIONED MSC DERIVED EVS. WE WILL ALSO GENERATE ENGINEERED MSC EVS THAT OVEREXPRESS CANDIDATE MIRNA WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES TO FURTHER STUDY THE MECHANISTIC ASPECTS BY WHICH INDIVIDUAL EV RELATED MIRNAS CONTROL THE IMMUNOMODULATION FUNCTIONALITY. IN AIM 2, WE WILL CREATE A NOVEL DUAL DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH LZ-HYDROGELS AND ALGINATE BEADS THAT CONTAIN ENGINEERED EVS AND RHBMP2 RESPECTIVELY. WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT 1) EVS WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES (GENERATED FROM AIM 1) CAN BE RELEASED DURING THE INFLAMMATORY PHASE OF HEALING (UP TO 7 DAYS) FROM A SELF-ASSEMBLING LZ- HYDROGEL AND 2) RHBMP2 THAT IS ENCAPSULATED IN ALGINATE BEADS WITH AN EXTENDED-RELEASE PROFILE (4-6 WEEKS) CAN PROVIDE A LONG TERM OSTEOINDUCTIVE SIGNAL TO PROMOTE/ENHANCE BONE REGENERATION. IN AIM 3, USING A DIABETIC MOUSE CALVARIAL DEFECT MODEL, WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ENGINEERED MSC EVS CONTAINING ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MIRNA WILL SUPPRESS INFLAMMATION UPON WOUNDING WHILE SUSTAINED RELEASED RHBMP2 PROMOTE BONE HEALING. OVERALL, THE RESULTS OF THESE FIRST STUDIES OF THE COMBINATORIAL USAGE OF ENGINEERED AND MSC EVS RHBMP2 WILL PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR CONTINUED DEFINITION OF MSC EV-MEDIATED IMMUNOMODULATION, AND THE REGENERATIVE PROPERTIES AND APPLICABILITY OF THE DUAL DELIVERY SYSTEM TO BONE HEALING IN T2DM.

THE STUDY OF TOOTH DEVELOPMENT IS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THESE CONGENITAL DISORDERS AND DEVELOPING NOVEL THERAPIES AND TREATMENTS, AND THUS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR ORAL HEALTH. HOWEVER, THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL TOOTH DEVELOPMENT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE LONG- TERM GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS THAT FUNCTION AS IMPORTANT REGULATORS OF TOOTH DEVELOPMENT IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND EPIGENETIC REGULATORY MECHANISMS UNDERLYING TOOTH ENAMEL DEVELOPMENT AND TO ADDRESS WHY LOSS-OF-FUNCTION MUTATIONS OF THE P63 GENE CAUSE TOOTH ANOMALIES, INCLUDING ED. P63 IS A MASTER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR OF ECTODERMAL DEVELOPMENT AND HOMEOSTASIS, AS EVIDENCED BY ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA IN INDIVIDUALS WITH P63 MUTATIONS, OFTEN INVOLVING ED AND OTHER DENTAL ANOMALIES. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF NP63, THE MAJOR ISOFORM OF P63, AND THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH NP63 REGULATES THE CHROMATIN AND TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN TOOTH DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN DUE TO LACK OF TARGETED GENETIC SYSTEMS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEED, A WELL- DEFINED NP63 KNOCKOUT MOUSE MODEL WAS GENERATED TO PERFORM ROBUST, INDUCIBLE DELETION OF NP63 IN THE DEVELOPING ENAMEL ORGAN. BASED ON PRELIMINARY DATA AND RE-ANALYSIS OF PUBLISHED WORK BY OTHERS, IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT P63 FUNCTIONS AS A MAJOR REGULATOR OF TOOTH ENAMEL DEVELOPMENT BY COMPREHENSIVELY ACTIVATING ITS TARGET GENES, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR DRIVING EARLIER CELL FATE SPECIFICATION AND LATER CELL DIFFERENTIATION EVENTS IN THE ENAMEL ORGAN CELLS. USING GENOMICS AND EPIGENOMICS APPROACHES AND A NEWLY DEVELOPED MOUSE MODEL OF ED IN ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA, IN WHICH NP63 KNOCKOUT IS INDUCED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT, THREE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED. AIM 1 WILL DEFINE THE DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANISMS THAT REQUIRE P63 ACTION DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. AIM 2 WILLDEFINE THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS BY WHICH P63 DIRECTS TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. FINALLY, AIM 3 WILL IDENTIFY THE CELL-STATE TRANSITION DYNAMICS AND THE UNDERLYING EPIGENETIC MECHANISM GOVERNED BY NP63 IN TOOTH DEVELOPMENT.

OSCC IS THE SIXTH MOST COMMON CANCER GLOBALLY WITH INCIDENCE CONTINUING TO RISE. CURRENT THERAPIES FOR OSCC ARE INADEQUATE AND OSCC ARE RESISTANT TO IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITION (ICI), RESULTING IN FREQUENT REOCCURRENCE AND POOR RATES OF PATIENT SURVIVAL. THE DEVELOPMENT OF TARGETED THERAPIES FOR OSCC IS HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF COMMON DRIVING ONCOGENE MUTATIONS, BUT INACTIVATION OF THE P53 TUMOR SUPPRESSOR IS FREQUENT IN HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) NEGATIVE OSCC, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO TREATMENT RESISTANCE, IMMUNE CELL SUPPRESSION, AND REDUCED PATIENT SURVIVAL. THEREFORE, NEW AND INNOVATIVE TREATMENT APPROACHES ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR OSCC AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH INACTIVATED P53. THUS, WE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY NEW VULNERABILITIES IN HPV-NEGATIVE OSCC. IT WAS BELIEVED THAT IF P53 WAS INACTIVATED, CANCER CELLS DID NOT REQUIRE MDM2, WHICH BINDS AND REGULATES P53. HOWEVER, CHALLENGING THIS LONG-HELD BELIEF, OUR RESULTS WITH CANCERS ARISING IN P53-NULL MICE SHOWED THAT THE MDM2 ONCOGENE WAS REQUIRED FOR THE SURVIVAL OF P53-NULL MURINE CANCERS. CAPITALIZING ON OUR PARADIGM-SHIFTING DISCOVERY IN MICE, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA REVEAL MDM2 IS A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN AND UNEXPECTED VULNERABILITY IN P53-INACTIVATED HUMAN OSCC.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS WITH A NOVEL MDM2-TARGETED DEGRADER WE DESIGNED AND SYNTHESIZED SUPPORT THIS HYPOTHESIS.

WE HAVE ALSO ASSESSED THE DYNAMIC INTERPLAY OF CELL PROLIFERATION, CELL ORIENTATION AND ACTOMYOSIN CONTRACTION THAT UNDERLIES NORMAL PALATAL SHELF ELEVATION. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED NOVEL METHODOLOGIES TO USE MRI FOR IN UTERO IMAGING AND TO USE FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS TO MODEL PALATAL SHELF ELEVATION. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE ROLE OF CYTOSKELETAL SCAFFOLDING PROTEIN SPECC1L IN PALATOGENESIS. WE IDENTIFIED THE FIRST DE NOVO AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT SPECC1L MUTATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH OROFACIAL CLEFTS. WE AND OTHERS HAVE NOW SHOWN THAT PATIENTS WITH SPECC1L MUTATIONS CLUSTERED IN THE SECOND COIL ED COIL DOMAIN (CCD2) OR CALPONIN HOMOLOGY DOMAIN (CHD) COMMONLY MANIFEST HYPERTELORISM, CLEFT PALATE AND OMPHALOCELE AMONG OTHER PHENOTYPES. USING MULTIPLE SPECC1L MOUSE ALLELES, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT LOSS OF SPECC1L LEADS TO A DELAY IN PALATAL SHELF ELEVATION. INTERESTINGLY, IN-FRAME CCD2 SPECIFIC MUTATIONS (DELETIONS, POINT MUTATIONS) IN MICE RESULT IN A MORE SEVERE PALATAL SHELF ELEVATION DELAY, INDICATING A GAIN-OF-FUNCTION. AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL, CCD2 LEADS TO PERINUCLEAR MISLOCALIZATION OF SPECC1L ALONG WITH A DISRUPTION OF CYTOPLASMIC FILAMENTOUS ACTIN AND NON-MUSCLE MYOSIN II.

THUS, ABOUT 75% OF BIRTH DEFECTS INVOLVE THE HEAD, FACE, AND ORAL TISSUES - WITH OROFACIAL CLEFTING AFFECTING ~1 IN 700 LIVE BIRTHS.

HOWEVER, THERAPIES TARGETING EGFR IN MULTIMODALITY THERAPY FOR HNSCC HAVE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR ADVANCED STAGE DISEASE. THEREFORE, ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TARGETING EGFR AND ASSOCIATED CRITICAL PATHWAYS ARE NEEDED TO COMBAT HNSCC, THE SIXTH MOST DIAGNOSED CANCER WORLDWIDE. OUR PREVIOUS RESEARCH IDENTIFIED MICRORNA-27A* (MIR- 27A*; MIR-27A-5P) AS A REGULATOR OF EGFR, PROTEIN KINASE B (AKT1), AND MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (MTOR). ALL THESE PROTEINS ARE COMMONLY UPREGULATED IN CANCER CELLS, LIKELY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF TUMORS REPRESSING MIR-27A* EXPRESSION, AND PROVIDE A CELL SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE. FURTHERMORE, RE-INTRODUCTION OF MIR- 27A* INTO TUMOR CELLS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO CAUSES APOPTOSIS, RAISING THE EXCITING PROSPECT THAT BY SIMULTANEOUSLY TARGETING MULTIPLE ONCOGENIC PATHWAYS, MIR-27A* MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPY FOR HNSCC. ACCORDINGLY, OUR LONG-TERM CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP MIR-27A* AS AN EFFECTIVE MULTIMODALITY THERAPEUTIC OPTION FOR HNSCC, WHICH IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE MISSION OF THE NIDCR \u201c\u2026TO IMPROVE ORAL, DENTAL, AND CRANIOFACIAL HEALTH THROUGH RESEARCH...\u201d. THIS REQUIRES US TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF MIR-27A* TARGETS, TO DEFINE NOVEL THERAPEUTIC COMBINATIONS THAT ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF MIR-27A* TO INHIBIT HNSCC PROGRESSION, AND TO DEVELOP AN APPROACH TO TRANSLATE MIR-27A* INTO THE CLINICAL ARENA. CURRENTLY, A KNOWLEDGE GAP EXISTS REGARDING VALIDATED TARGETS OF MIR-27A* AND THE PATHWAYS THEY INFLUENCE IN HNSCC PROGRESSION, AS WELL AS COMBINATORIAL TREATMENTS THAT COULD AUGMENT MIR-27A* ANTI-TUMOR EFFECTS.

ALVEOLAR BONE LOSS LEADS TO LOOSENING OR LOSS OF TEETH OR DENTAL IMPLANTS THAT DISRUPTS THE MOST BASIC DAILY FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS EATING AND SPEAKING. VARIOUS BONE GRAFTS ARE BEING USED TO RESTORE ALVEOLAR BONE LOSS, BUT POOR PROGNOSIS REMAINS A LONG-STANDING PROBLEM. AUTOGRAFTS ARE CONSIDERED THE GOLD STANDARD, BUT THESE GRAFTS EXHIBIT SIGNIFICANT VOLUME LOSS IN INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS. THE AVAILABLE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL FOR AUTOGRAFTS IS LIMITED, AND SURGICAL HARVESTING PROCEDURES ARE OFTEN COMPLEX AND ASSOCIATED WITH MORBIDITY, PAIN, AND INFECTION AT THE DONOR SITE. ALLOGRAFTS AND XENOGRAFTS HAVE LESS BONE FORMATION CAPACITY THAN AUTOGRAFTS, WHILE THEY ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH RISKS OF INFECTION, DISEASE TRANSMISSION, AND IMMUNOLOGICAL REJECTION BY THE HOST. SYNTHETIC BONE GRAFTS SUCH AS HYDROXYAPATITE (HAP) AND BETA-TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE (SS-TCP) HAVE ALSO BEEN WIDELY USED, MOSTLY IN GRANULE OR BLOCK FORM. HOWEVER, NONE OF THE EXISTING SYNTHETIC BONE GRAFT MATERIALS EXHIBIT SUFFICIENT BONE FORMATION CAPACITY TO RESTORE INFLAMMATORY ALVEOLAR BONE LOSS TO PRE-DISEASE LEVELS. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEXT-GENERATION BONE IMPLANT THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY REGENERATE ALVEOLAR BONE IN CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS. ALVEOLAR BONE ALMOST NEVER SPONTANEOUSLY REGENERATES IN THE PRESENCE OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. EXCESS INFLAMMATION DESTROYS TISSUES AND SUPPORTS THE GROWTH OF PATHOGENS LEADING TO THE REALIZATION THAT EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF MICROBIOME DYSBIOSIS IN PERIODONTITIS CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF INFLAMMATION. INFLAMMATION CAN BE RESOLVED BY SPECIALIZED PRO-RESOLVING LIPID MEDIATORS (SPMS) THAT CAN RAPIDLY RESTORE TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS TO STOP THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP OF INFECTION-INFLAMMATION AND BOOST BONE REGENERATION. SPMS EFFECTIVELY REGULATE INFLAMMATION IN UTERO THROUGH EARLY CHILDHOOD, BUT THEIR PRODUCTION AND EFFECTIVENESS DIMINISH WITH AGE. IN MANY INSTANCES, CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES SUCH AS PERIODONTITIS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A FAILURE OF NATURAL RESOLUTION PATHWAYS.

THE MAJORITY OF DEATHS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO METASTASIS AND TREATMENT FAILURE, AND UNFORTUNATELY, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PATHWAYS IS INCOMPLETE. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE ARE NO TARGETED THERAPIES AGAINST THESE BIOLOGIC PROCESSES. RECENTLY, WE PERFORMED A SINGLE CELL ANALYSIS OF HNSCC TUMORS THAT REVEALED A NEW TRANSCRIPTIONAL PATHWAY \u2013 DUBBED A HYBRID EPITHELIAL/MESENCHYMAL STATE (HEM) \u2013 AS A CRITICAL DRIVER OF INVASION AND METASTASIS. THIS PATHWAY IS CLEARLY DISTINCT FROM THE CLASSICAL EMT PATHWAY, AS MOST KEY EMT TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS (TFS) WERE NOT EXPRESSED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SNAIL2. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PATHWAY TO DISEASE ETIOLOGY WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE HEM SIGNATURE IN TUMORS WAS MORE PREDICTIVE OF TREATMENT OUTCOME THAN ANY OTHER COMMONLY USED PATHOLOGIC OR DEMOGRAPHIC FACTOR. THE MAIN DRIVER OF HEM APPEARS TO BE THE SNAIL2 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW SNAIL2 ORCHESTRATES HEM. WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT TARGETS OF SNAIL2 AND ASSESS THEIR ROLES IN PROMOTING INVASION AND METASTASIS. THIS WILL REVEAL THE PROTEINS IN THE HEM PATHWAY THAT PROMOTE TUMOR PROGRESSION AND THUS REPRESENT TARGETS FOR THE RATIONAL DESIGN OF THERAPEUTICS. BECAUSE HNSCC TUMORS ARE HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS, WE EXPECT THAT BULK GENOMIC APPROACHES MAY NOT CAPTURE SNAIL2 TARGETS THAT ARE ACTIVATED OR REPRESSED IN SMALL SUBPOPULATIONS OF TUMOR CELLS; YET SUCH TARGETS MAY STILL BE HIGHLY RELEVANT TO THE ETIOLOGY OF HNSCC PROGRESSION. THEREFORE, WE WILL ALSO USE A TRANSPOSON-BASED TECHNOLOGY KNOWN AS \u201cCALLING CARDS\u201d THAT HAS SINGLE-CELL RESOLUTION TO MAKE A COMPREHENSIVE MAP OF THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL TARGETS OF SNAIL2 ACROSS DISTINCT HYBRID EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL CELL STATES (AIM 1).

TO COMPLEMENT THIS APPROACH, IN AIM 2, WE WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER SNAIL2 ACTS COOPERATIVELY WITH OTHER TFS AND THEN LEARN THE FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH COOPERATIVITY. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHILE IT HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO FIND SMALL MOLECULES THAT INHIBIT TF-DNA INTERACTIONS, TARGETING COOPERATIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TFS IS EMERGING AS A VIABLE STRATEGY FOR TARGETING ONCOGENIC TFS. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THESE TFS COOPERATE WITH SNAIL2 AT SOME LOCI, THEY LIKELY ACTIVATE OTHER HEM GENES INDEPENDENTLY OR BY INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER, SO IDENTIFYING THEIR TARGETS WILL INCREASE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PATHWAY AND EXPAND THE LIST OF DRUGGABLE HEM TARGETS.

IN DENTISTRY, THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRESSION OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND THE BREAKDOWN OF THE DENTAL SUBSTRATE/RESTORATIVE MATERIAL INTERFACE LEADING TO BACTERIA RECOLONIZATION AND RECURRENT CARIES, THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF FAILURE OF DENTAL RESTORATIONS. THESE PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS TOGETHER ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST 80% OF THE TOOTH EXTRACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE, TWO INNOVATIVE PLATFORMS ARE PROPOSED. THE FIRST STRATEGY IS BASED ON THE ENCAPSULATION OF TWO POTENT MMP INHIBITORS, THE POLYPHENOLS QUERCETIN AND EPIGALLOCATECHIN GALLATE, IN NANO MICELLES CLEAVABLE BY MMPS. THE SHELL OF THE PARTICLES IS COMPOSED OF PEPTIDES WITH SPECIFIC SEQUENCES OF AMINO ACIDS RECOGNIZED AND CLEAVED BY THE TARGETED MMPS, LEADING TO RUPTURE OF THE MICELLES AND THE RELEASE OF THE INHIBITOR MOLECULES. IN ESSENCE, THIS SYSTEM ENABLES THE MMP TO INHIBIT ITSELF. THE SECOND STRATEGY IS AN IMMUNOMODULATORY PLATFORM BASED ON THE INTRODUCTION OF ANTI-MMP NANOBODIES, SINGLE DOMAIN ANTIBODIES DERIVED FROM LLAMA HEAVY-CHAIN ONLY ANTIBODIES, TO INHIBIT/CEASE MMP PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY.

ALTHOUGH THE SYMPTOMS OF CFM CAN VARY WIDELY IN SEVERITY, THEY SHARE A VARIETY OF FEATURES CONSISTENT WITH ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF FIRST AND SECOND PHARYNGEAL ARCHES, INCLUDING A SHORTENING OF THE MANDIBLE, MICROTIA, PREAURICULAR TAGS AND EPIBULBAR DERMOIDS. THESE DEFECTS ARE TYPICALLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY UNILATERAL, AND ALTHOUGH SOME FAMILIES PRESENTING WITH CFM HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, MOST ARE CONSIDERED SPORADIC AND HAVE NO GENETIC DIAGNOSIS. DIFFICULTIES IN UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGINS OF CFM INCLUDE ITS HETEROGENEITY, THE LACK OF CLEAR UNDERLYING MOLECULAR MECHANISMS AND THE PAUCITY OF GOOD ANIMAL MODELS FOR THESE DISORDERS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, FOXI3, THAT IS EXPRESSED EARLY AND BROADLY IN PHARYNGEAL ECTODERM AND ENDODERM, AND IS LATER RESTRICTED TO THE PHARYNGEAL POUCHES AND CLEFTS. FOXI3 MUTANT MICE SHOW SEVERE DEFECTS IN MOST PHARYNGEAL ARCH DERIVATIVES \u2013 FOR EXAMPLE, THE MUTANTS LACK MUCH OF THE LOWER JAW, AND HAVE A COMPLETE LOSS OF THE MIDDLE EAR OSSICLES AND THE EXTERNAL EAR.

PAIN CONDITIONS WHICH FREQUENTLY CO-AGGREGATE HAVE COME TO BE KNOWN AS CHRONIC OVERLAPPING PAIN CONDITIONS (COPCS). CO-AGGREGATION OF MULTIPLE CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS FREQUENTLY RESULTS IN NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS IN ADDITION TO PAIN, INCLUDING FATIGUE, SLEEP DEFICITS, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT, AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND EVEN SUICIDAL IDEATION. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE SIDE EFFECTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON PATIENT WELL-BEING, COPCS HAVE WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITH A SINGLE CHRONIC PAIN CONDITION. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUAL COPCS SUCH AS TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT DISORDERS (TMD), FIBROMYALGIA (FM), AND MIGRAINES HAVE A HIGHER PREVALENCE IN BIOLOGICAL FEMALES THAN IN BIOLOGICAL MALES, AND THEIR COAGGREGATION IS LIKEWISE HIGHER IN FEMALES. THUS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH INVESTIGATIONS BE UNDERTAKEN WHICH EXPLORES THE MECHANISTIC DETERMINANTS OF COPCS IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE COMORBID CONDITIONS, AND WHICH CRITICALLY EVALUATES THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS IN BIOLOGICAL MALES AND FEMALES.

OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR DEVELOPING A NOVEL THERAPY FOR TMD AND MIGRAINE OVERLAPPING PAIN. IN OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN ANIMAL MODEL TO STUDY TMD PAIN AND ITS COMORBIDITY WITH MIGRAINE BY COMBINING MASSETER MUSCLE TENDON LIGATION (MMTL)- PRODUCED MYOGENIC TMD WITH SYSTEMIC INJECTION OF NITROGLYCERIN (NTG)-INDUCED MIGRAINE-LIKE PAIN, AND THIS WORK HAS BEEN PUBLISHED RECENTLY.

WE OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT BLOCKADE OF DYNORPHIN IN THE SPINAL TRIGEMINAL NUCLEUS CAUDALIS (SP5C) OF FEMALE MICE SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITS MYOGENIC TMD PAIN AND DIMINISHES TMD-ENHANCED MIGRAINE-LIKE PAIN, AND THAT SP5C INJECTION OF DYNORPHIN ENABLES A NON-SENSITIZING DOSE OF NTG TO PRODUCE PERSISTENT MIGRAINE-LIKE PAIN IN FEMALE MICE, BUT NOT MALE MICE. WE FURTHER FOUND THAT SP5C ANTAGONISM OF BRADYKININ RECEPTOR, BUT NOT KAPPA OPIOID RECEPTOR, INHIBITS SUCH OVERLAPPING PAIN IN FEMALE MICE. MOREOVER, BRADYKININ RECEPTOR B2 (BKRB2), BUT NOT BKRB1, IS EXPRESSED IN THE SP5C, AND MMTL PLUS NTG TREATMENT DECREASES THE BINDING OF BKRB2 WITH NEURONAL NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE (NNOS) AND INCREASES NOS ACTIVITY IN THE SP5C, WHICH WILL INCREASE NITRIC OXIDE PRODUCTION AND THEN PROMOTE MIGRAINE PAIN DEVELOPMENT. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SP5C DYNORPHIN COULD PLAY A FEMALE- SPECIFIC ROLE IN TMD PAIN AND ITS COMORBIDITY WITH MIGRAINE THROUGH A NON-OPIOID RECEPTOR MECHANISM.

AN ALTERNATIVE IS POSSIBLE IN JUVENILE PATIENTS, CALLED OVER-INSTRUMENTATION (OI). DURING OI, THE PULPAL CHAMBER IS EXPOSED TO THE PERIPHERAL CIRCULATION POST-PULPECTOMY. AS LONG AS THE APICAL PAPILLA IS INTACT, SOME TISSUE REGENERATION TAKES PLACE IN THE PULPAL CANAL SUBSEQUENTLY \u2014 ALTHOUGH THE DISORGANIZED TISSUE DOES NOT MIMIC NATIVE SOFT TISSUE. IN ADULTS IN PARTICULAR, OI RESULTS IN NON-FUNCTIONAL PULPAL OSSIFICATION. ANOTHER CONCERN IN ENDODONTIC PROCEDURES IS OCCURRENCE/RECURRENCE OF COLONIZATION BY ORAL BACTERIA. SUCH INFECTIONS MAY PROLONG AND EXACERBATE PULPAL INFLAMMATION. A MATERIAL- BASED FORMULATION IS PROPOSED THAT CAN (A) PROMOTE VASCULARIZED SOFT-TISSUE REGENERATION IN THE PULP, WHILE (B) RESISTING BACTERIAL INFECTION. OUR STRATEGY RESTS ON SELF-ASSEMBLING PEPTIDE HYDROGELS \u2014 A CLASS OF SUPRAMOLECULAR MATERIALS THAT CAN BE INJECTED IN VIVO WHILE KEEPING THEIR GEL-LIKE PROPERTIES. THE MATERIALS CONSIST OF CANONICAL AMINO ACIDS AND ARE BIOCOMPATIBLE. SUCH MATERIALS NEED TO PROVIDE BOTH MECHANICAL SUPPORT AND BIOLOGICAL CUES FOR TISSUE INGROWTH. SOMEWHAT COUNTER-INTUITIVELY, A SELF-ASSEMBLING PEPTIDE HYDROGEL, WITHOUT ADDED GROWTH FACTORS OR EXOGENOUS CELLS, DEMONSTRATED FORMATION OF VASCULARIZED SOFT-TISSUE IN A CANINE PULPECTOMY MODEL IN 28 DAYS. IN A SEPARATE STUDY, A DIFFERENT CATIONIC AMPHIPHILIC HYDROGEL BELONGING TO THE SAME PLATFORM, SHOWED EFFICACY IN INHIBITING BACTERIAL GROWTH VIA MEMBRANE PERMEABILIZATION. IN THIS PROPOSAL, A COMBINATORIAL TREATMENT MODALITY WILL BE TESTED FOR ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN ACHIEVING THE DUAL GOALS DESCRIBED ABOVE. A MECHANISTIC PUZZLE THAT THESE PROJECTS WOULD HELP SOLVE IS THE LINEAGE/SOURCE OF INFILTRATING CELLS AND EVOLUTION OF THE CELLULAR MILIEU IN THE PULPAL CANAL AFTER PULPECTOMY AND IMPLANTATION OF SOFT BIOMIMETIC HYDROGELS. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LONG- TERM MATURATION OF THE VASCULARIZED SOFT TISSUE PROMOTED BY SUCH HYDROGELS IS ANOTHER TARGET.

IN AIM 1, WE WILL DEVELOP A MALLEABLE AND SELF-HEALING HYDROGEL BASED ON THE SELF-ASSEMBLY OF PHYTOCHEMICAL-GRAFTED CHITOSAN WITH SILICA-RICH NANOCLAYS, WHERE THE DECORATED PHYTOCHEMICAL DRIVES DYNAMIC INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS FOR GELATION AND NANOCLAY WORKS AS PHYSICAL CROSSLINKER WITH OSTEOINDUCTIVE PROPERTY. BY VARYING THE RATIO OF PHYTOCHEMICAL TO NANOCLAY AND THE CONTENT OF DBM PARTICLES, HYDROGEL/DBM COMPOSITES WILL BE DESIGNED AND PREPARED BY EVALUATING GELATION KINETICS, INJECTABILITY AND SELF-HEALING CHARACTERISTICS. THE OSTEOINDUCTIVE ACTIVITY OF THE DEVELOPED COMPOSITE WILL BE DETERMINED IN VITRO AND IN A RAT CALVARIAL DEFECT. NEXT IN AIM 2, WE WILL HARVEST EM FROM MSCS TRANSFECTED WITH NOGGIN-DIRECTED SIRNA AND EVALUATE THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF EM ON DBM-INDUCED BONE FORMATION. WE WILL ALSO CONJUGATE EM TO HYDROGELS VIA A CLICK CROSSLINKING REACTION FOR MORE LOCALIZED AND PROLONGED NOGGIN SILENCING EFFECTS. FINALLY IN AIM 3, WE WILL INTEGRATE DBM AND EM LOADED WITH NOGGIN SIRNA INTO SELF-HEALING HYDROGELS OF PHYTOCHEMICAL AND NANOCLAY DEVELOPED FROM AIM 1 AND EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF THE BONE GRAFT COMPOSITE TO PROMOTE BONE REGENERATION IN MORE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENTS USING A MANDIBULAR DEFECT MODEL. SUCCESSFUL BONE FORMATION WILL BE EVALUATED COMPARED WITH COMMERCIAL DBM PRODUCTS AND RECOMBINANT BMP-2. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THESE STUDIES WILL IDENTIFY A NEW STRATEGY TO IMPROVE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF CURRENT BONE GRAFTING BY MAXIMIZING ACTIVITY OF BMP SIGNALING IN DBM-MEDIATED BONE REGENERATION.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3231cda5-201a-6da0-de9e-e9810a848983-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R01DE031711_7529"}, {"internal_id": 159210098, "Award ID": "R01DE031491", "Award Amount": 632057.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-05-11", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "SMALL SCALE ROBOTICS FOR AUTOMATED DENTAL BIOFILM THERANOSTICS - PROJECT ABSTRACT ORAL BIOFILM-RELATED INFECTIONS REMAIN A PERSISTENT AND COSTLY CLINICAL PROBLEM.

BECAUSE OUR FINDINGS CHALLENGE THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF MC, WE HAVE DESIGNED THIS PROJECT TO VALIDATE THE DEVELOPMENTAL EVENTS THAT TAKE PLACE AS THE MIDPORTION OF MC DISAPPEARS AND THE MANDIBLE FORMS THROUGH A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF FOUR PROCESSES: 1) INITIATION AND GROWTH IN LENGTH OF MC; 2) MINERALIZATION OF MC PERICHONDRIUM; 3) MINERALIZATION OF THE MANDIBLE; AND 4) DISAPPEARANCE OF MC. OUR APPROACH IS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE GAINED THROUGH PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS OF THESE PROCESSES OCCURRING AT DIFFERENT TIMES ALONG THE LENGTH OF MC, AND SPANNING THE BUCCAL TO LINGUAL ASPECTS OF THE INTERIOR OF MC.

A POSSIBLE FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THIS INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION IS THAT PD CAN CAUSE LOW-GRADE SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION, WHICH MAY IN TURN INFLUENCE COMORBIDITIES.

PUBLICLY AVAILABLE NATIONWIDE SURVEY DATABASES (SUCH AS THE NHANES), AND LARGE ORAL HEALTH DATABASES (SUCH AS THE HEALTHPARTNERS\u00ae, HP) ARE IMPORTANT, BUT SOMEWHAT UNDER-UTILIZED RESOURCES FOR SUCH EVALUATIONS AND PRACTICAL INTERPRETATIONS, MAINLY DUE TO SEVERAL UNIQUE STATISTICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL COMPLEXITIES, WHICH ARE OFTEN BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF EXISTING STANDARD ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND SOFTWARE PACKAGES. FURTHERMORE, HOW TO PRIORITIZE PATIENTS FOR ORAL CLINIC VISITS BASED ON THEIR SEX/GENDER DETERMINANTS, AND MULTI-COMORBIDITY RISKS CONTINUES TO REMAIN UNRESOLVED. IN THIS PROJECT, WE ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, AND INITIALLY PROPOSE A STOCHASTICALLY-PRINCIPLED, NATIONALLY MEANINGFUL, SUMMARY RISK INDEX (AIM 1) REPRESENTING CROSS-SECTIONAL PD ASSOCIATION FROM ABOUT 11,700 ADULT DENTATE SUBJECTS, WHO ARE PART OF THE NHANES 2009-2014 STUDY, FOR THE 4 TARGET GROUPS: (A) MALES WITH T2D, (B) MALES WITHOUT T2D, (C) FEMALES WITH T2D, AND (D) FEMALES, WITHOUT T2D. WE THEN REFINE AND VALIDATE THIS DERIVED INDEX, AND PROPOSE A TIME-VARYING PD INDEX (AIM 2) FOR THE FOUR TARGET SUBGROUPS, ACCOMMODATING CAUSALITY OF PERIODONTAL TREATMENT EFFECTS, VIA APPLICATION TO THE RICH, LONGITUDINAL, OBSERVATIONAL HP DATABASE OF ABOUT 25,000 SUBJECTS IN A PRACTICE-BASED SETTING, WITH FURTHER MODEL FITTING AND CROSS-VALIDATION USING THE KAISER PERMANENTE NORTHWEST DATABASE OF ABOUT 1,17,000 SUBJECTS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO EVIDENCE-BASED PREVENTION STRATEGIES FOR DENTAL FEAR AND EXISTING PREVENTION STRATEGIES FOR RELATED ANXIETY DISORDERS ARE TYPICALLY LOW-DOSE VERSIONS OF DIFFUSE TREATMENT PROGRAMS WITHOUT A SPECIFIED MECHANISM OF ACTION.

PATIENTS WITH HNSCC, PARTICULARLY HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV)-NEGATIVE HNSCC, EXHIBIT POOR OVERALL 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATES COMPARED TO BREAST AND COLORECTAL CANCERS. THEREFORE, NOVEL EFFECTIVE THERAPIES NEED TO BE DEVELOPED FOR HNSCC PATIENTS. EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT HISTONE METHYLATION PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN ACTIVATION OF GENE TRANSCRIPTION IN HNSCC BY REGULATING CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THE HISTONE DEMETHYLASE KDM4A AS A KEY EPIGENETIC FACTOR, STIMULATED THE TRANSCRIPTION OF THE INVASIVE GENES TO PROMOTE HNSCC INVASION AND METASTASIS BY ERASING REPRESSIVE H3K9ME3 MARKS. TO FURTHER CONFIRM THAT KDM4A IS AN IMPORTANT TARGET FOR HNSCC TREATMENT, WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE 4-NITROQUINOLINE 1-OXIDE (4-NQO)- INDUCED MOUSE MODEL OF HNSCC, WHICH FULLY SIMULATES HNSCC DEVELOPMENT AND LYMPH NODE METASTASIS IN A SYNGENEIC TUMOR IMMUNE MICROENVIRONMENT. WE FOUND THAT THE SPECIFIC DELETION OF KDM4A SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED HNSCC INVASIVE GROWTH AND LYMPH NODE METASTASIS. OUR RNA-SEQ ANALYSIS FOUND THAT KDM4A ABLATION SIGNIFICANTLY SUPPRESSED THE GENE EXPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH CELL MIGRATION AND EPITHELIAL MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION IN PRIMARY HNSCC, WHICH CONFIRMED OUR PREVIOUS FINDINGS. UNEXPECTEDLY, A SET OF GENES ASSOCIATED WITH IMMUNE RESPONSE WAS ROBUSTLY UPREGULATED IN PRIMARY HNSCC TISSUES FROM KDM4A KNOCKOUT MICE. IMMUNOSTAINING REVEALED THAT THE INHIBITION OF KDM4A INCREASED THE INFILTRATION OF CD8+ T CELLS IN HNSCC. RECENTLY, IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS TARGETING PD1/PD-L1 HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT SUCCESS IN SEVERAL SOLID TUMORS INCLUDING HNSCC. ALTHOUGH ANTI-PD1 THERAPY HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR TREATING RECURRENT OR METASTATIC HNSCC, THE OBJECTIVE RESPONSE RATE IS LESS THAN 20%, INDICATING THAT HNSCC CELLS MIGHT BE INTRINSICALLY RESISTANT TO CHECKPOINT BLOCKADES.

THE OVER-EXPRESSED/-ACTIVATED EGFR CONTRIBUTES TO EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION (EMT) AND TUMOR PROGRESSION BY CONTRIBUTING TO TUMOR METASTASIS AND CHEMO-RESISTANCE. HENCE, EGFR HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MAJOR THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR OSCC. ENDOCYTOSIS IS A KEY BIOLOGICAL PATHWAY FOR INTERNALIZATION OF LIGAND ACTIVATED EGFR, FOLLOWING WHICH IT GETS ROUTED FOR LYSOSOMAL DEGRADATION BY THE ENDOSOMAL SORTING COMPLEX FOR RECRUITMENT AND TRANSPORT (ESCRT) MACHINERY. ESCRT IS A KEY MEDIATOR OF ENDOCYTIC VESICLE TRAFFICKING (EVT). WHILE VESICLE TRAFFICKING DEFECTS RESULT IN THE POOR DOWNREGULATION OF ACTIVATED EGFR, PERSISTENT SURFACE AND CELLULAR EGFR EXPRESSION AND SIGNALING IS SUBSEQUENTLY LINKED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER. SURPRISINGLY, THE MOLECULAR EVENTS/MECHANISMS THAT REGULATE ESCRT PATHWAY WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR MAINTAINING EGFR HOMEOSTASIS AND PREVENTING EMT AND TUMORIGENESIS ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. HERE, BASED ON SOLID PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN MECHANISM THAT REGULATES ESCRT DEPENDENT EVT, EGFR LEVELS AND SIGNALING, EMT, AND OSCC GROWTH. WE FOUND THAT 1) DEPLETION OF CPAP CAUSED THE PROLONGED EXPRESSION OF EGFR AND AN EMT-LIKE PHENOTYPE IN ORAL CANCER CELLS; 2) WHILE DEPLETION OF CPAP ENHANCED THE TUMORIGENICITY OF AN OSCC CELL LINE, OVEREXPRESSION OF CPAP IN THIS CELL LINE SUPPRESSED ITS TUMOR INDUCING POTENTIAL; 3) OVEREXPRESSION OF CPAP CAUSED THE DE NOVO GENERATION OF EGFR- POSITIVE MULTIVESICULAR BODIES, WHOSE BIOGENESIS REQUIRES ESCRT AND ARE ESSENTIAL INTERMEDIATES THAT ROUTE EGFR TO LYSOSOMES FOR DEGRADATION AND TERMINATION OF ITS SIGNALING; AND 4) THE ABSENCE OF CPAP RESULTED IN DIMINISHED CELLULAR LEVELS OF VPS4 PROTEIN, AN ESSENTIAL ESCRT ASSOCIATED ATPASE THAT FACILITATES PINCHING OFF OF ENDOCYTIC VESICLES. THESE COLLECTIVE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT CPAP INDUCED POSITIVE REGULATION OF ESCRT PATHWAY AND EVT MAINTAINS EGFR HOMEOSTASIS, RESULTING IN PREVENTION OF EMT AND TUMORIGENESIS IN OSCC.

WE WILL THEN, UNDER AIM 2, DETERMINE THE ROLE OF CPAP IN PREVENTING EMT AND ORAL TUMORIGENESIS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY CHARACTERIZING CPAP GAIN- AND-LOSS-OF-FUNCTION IN OSCC CELL LINES FOR EMT FEATURES, AND GROWTH AND TUMORIGENIC PROPERTIES, AND BY STUDYING THE ORAL CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY USING A CONDITIONAL CPAP-KNOCKOUT MICE.

BONE REPAIR IS CRUCIAL TO RESTORE PATIENT FUNCTIONALITY POST-INJURY. SCAFFOLDS THAT ARE EASY-TO-HANDLE, INEXPENSIVE, BIODEGRADABLE, BIOACTIVE, AND NON-IMMUNOGENIC WITH ADEQUATE POROSITY AND OXYGEN CONTENT AS WELL AS PROPER MECHANICAL STRENGTH ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER FOR REPAIRING CRANIOFACIAL DEFECTS. THE CHOICE OF THE IMPLANT MATERIAL IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO FACILITATE RECOVERY OF THE INJURED PATIENTS.

FURTHERMORE, PD CAN TRIGGER GENERAL INFLAMMATION, ADVERSELY INFLUENCING CARDIOVASCULAR, CENTRAL NERVOUS, REPRODUCTIVE AND ENDOCRINE SYSTEMS. OUR LABORATORY HAS EXPLORED A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES FOR TREATING THIS DISEASE AND IS STILL ACTIVELY SEARCHING FOR A MORE EFFECTIVE AND PRACTICAL THERAPY WITH MINIMAL SIDE EFFECTS TO CURE THE DISEASE. LONG NONCODING RNAS (LNCRNAS) ARE A FAMILY OF NON-PROTEIN-CODING TRANSCRIPTS WITH THE LENGTH LONGER THAN 200 NUCLEOTIDES. LNCRNAS PARTICIPATE IN A WIDE REPERTOIRE OF BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN GENE EXPRESSION AND POSTTRANSCRIPTIONAL PROCESSES AND ARE ALSO IMPLICATED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF MANY DISEASES. HOWEVER, THE FUNCTIONS OF LNCRNAS IN DENTAL DISEASES ARE JUST BEGINNING TO BE UNCOVERED. LNCRNA ANRIL WAS THE FIRST SHARED GENETIC RISK FACTOR OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS, PD, DIABETES AND CANCERS, THEREBY COINED TO APCD. OUR LABORATORY HAS PERFORMED EXTENSIVE PRELIMINARY STUDIES INCLUDING STUDIES ON LNCRNA-APDC KNOCKOUT MICE. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT LNCR-APDC INHIBITS INFLAMMATION, OSTEOCLASTIC BONE RESORPTION AND PROMOTES OSTEOGENESIS AND ALVEOLAR BONE REGENERATION THROUGH SPECIFIC EPIGENETIC PATHWAYS, BY WHICH EFFICIENTLY TARGETING THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF PERIODONTITIS.

THE RESULTS WILL PROVIDE A PARADIGM SHIFT AND ADVANCE THE RESEARCH FIELD VERTICALLY IN THREE WAYS. FIRSTLY, WE HAVE INITIALLY FOUND THAT LNCR-APDC COULD PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND PROLIFERATION IN PD. HOWEVER, HOW THIS LNCRNA IS INVOLVED IN PD PROGRESSION IS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN. THEREFORE, THE RESULTS WILL REVEAL A NOVEL PATHOLOGICAL MECHANISM OF PD DETERIORATION AND PROGRESSION. SECONDLY, WE WILL DECIPHER THE PATHWAYS OF LNCR-APDC MODULATING GENE CLUSTERS IN DIFFERENT CELLS PLAYING ACTIVE ROLES IN THE PERIODONTAL MICROENVIRONMENT AND THEIR ROLES IN THE PD PROGRESSION, WHICH WILL LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS.

HOWEVER, PRENATAL ORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO INCREASE DENTAL UTILIZATION AMONG VULNERABLE PREGNANT WOMEN HAVE HAD DISAPPOINTING RESULTS. THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO IDENTIFYING UPSTREAM BARRIERS TO DOWNSTREAM DENTAL CARE UTILIZATION DURING PREGNANCY IS THE LACK OF LONGITUDINAL DATA ON FACTORS THAT PREDICT DENTAL CARE UTILIZATION AND ORAL HEALTH IN VULNERABLE WOMEN. THIS STUDY IS INFORMED BY THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINED CHOICE (BIRD & RIEKER, 1999), WHICH POSITS THAT WOMEN\u2019S OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE ARE CONSTRAINED DUE TO SOCIAL AND GENDER-RELATED PROCESSES THAT INTERACT WITH BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES (E.G., PREGNANCY).

A FUNDAMENTAL STEP IN JAW INTEGRATION BEGINS IN DEVELOPMENT, WITH FORMATION OF STABLE TENDON-BONE ATTACHMENTS THAT ARE ZONALLY ORGANIZED INTO TENDON, FIBROCARTILAGE, MINERALIZED FIBROCARTILAGE, AND BONE. THE GRADIENT OF SKELETOGENIC CELL TYPES WITHIN THE ATTACHMENT ARISES FROM ATTACHMENT PROGENITORS (APS) THAT, THROUGH UNCLEAR MECHANISMS, INTERPRET CHONDROGENIC VERSUS TENOGENIC SIGNALING TO ACQUIRE DISTINCT CELL FATES ALONG THE TENDON- BONE AXIS. EVEN LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT APS OF THE JAW WHICH, UNLIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE LIMB AND TRUNK, ARE DERIVED FROM NEURAL CREST CELLS (NCC). THIS STUDY TESTS THE IDEA THAT JAW APS DIFFERENTIATE INTO A GRADIENT OF SKELETOGENIC CELL TYPES THROUGH A SERIES OF BINARY SWITCHES THAT ARE REGULATED BY AN NCC-SPECIFIC MECHANISM. WE HAVE FOUND THAT JAW APS EXPRESS GRADED LEVELS OF SCX, RUNX2, AND SOX9 DEPENDING ON THEIR POSITION ALONG THE TENDON-BONE AXIS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT DURING AP DIFFERENTIATION A NOVEL INTERMEDIATE SCX+/RUNX2+ POPULATION EMERGES. IN RUNX2+/- MICE THIS INTERMEDIATE POPULATION FAILS TO FORM, AND APS DIFFERENTIATE INTO TENDON OVER CARTILAGE/BONE. WHILE THIS SUGGESTS THAT TRIPOTENT APS DIFFERENTIATE THROUGH LINEAGE-RESTRICTED INTERMEDIATES, HOW APS SPATIALLY INTERPRET SIGNALS FOR TENDON VS. CARTILAGE/BONE TO MAKE THESE CELL FATE DECISIONS AND WHETHER APS ALWAYS CHOOSE BETWEEN ONE FATE OR THE OTHER (E.G. TENOCYTE VS. OSTEOBLAST) OR ACQUIRE HYBRID PROPERTIES (E.G. OSTEOFIBROGENIC) IS UNKNOWN. WE RECENTLY SHOWED THAT AN FGF-NOTCH SIGNALING AXIS IS REGIONALLY DEPLOYED ALONG THE TENDON-BONE INTERFACE AND PROMOTES AP DIFFERENTIATION INTO TENDON OVER CARTILAGE/BONE. THIS MECHANISM APPEARS NCC-SPECIFIC, AS LOSS OF FGFR2 IN MESODERM-DERIVED APS DOES NOT ALTER LIMB ATTACHMENT DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE USE MOUSE GENETICS ALONG WITH CUTTING-EDGE GENOMICS TO TEST THAT, DURING AP DIFFERENTIATION, INTEGRATION OF FGF AND NOTCH SIGNALING PROMOTES TENDON CELL FATE IN A SERIES OF BINARY SWITCHES BY REGULATING LEVELS OF SCX, RUNX2, AND SOX9 TRANSCRIPTION. IN AIM1 WE WILL USE CLONAL LINEAGE TRACING AND SCRNA-SEQ TO DETERMINE THE LINEAGE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN APS AND THE SKELETOGENIC CELLS IN THE TENDON-BONE ATTACHMENT.

IN THE PARALLEL MECHANISM, ERK AND NOTCH2 INDEPENDENTLY ACTIVATE THE SAME DOWNSTREAM TARGETS GENES FOR TENDON FATE INCLUDING SCX.

TMJ OA IS A DISEASE OF CARTILAGE DEGENERATION AND CHONDROCYTE APOPTOSIS. ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS LEADING TO CHONDROCYTE APOPTOSIS IS THE SUPPRESSION OF THE CYTOPROTECTIVE PROCESS OF AUTOPHAGY. AUTOPHAGY IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST CELLULAR RESPONSES TO TMJ OA AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A VIABLE THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR ATTENUATING THE PROGRESSION OF CARTILAGE DEGENERATION. A MAJOR GAP IN KNOWLEDGE IS HOW MECHANICAL AND INFLAMMATORY STRESS LEADS TO THE EVENTUAL SUPPRESSION OF AUTOPHAGY, APOPTOSIS, AND CARTILAGE DEGENERATION. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, MY LAB HAS DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN A PRECLINICAL, SURGICAL INDUCTION MOUSE MODEL OF TMJ OA THAT CLOSELY CORRESPONDS TO THE HUMAN CONDITION AND IDENTIFIED A THREE-STEP PATHOGENESIS MODEL LINKING MECHANICAL DAMAGE TO ECM CHANGES AND CHONDROCYTE APOPTOSIS THAT INCLUDES 1) THE DEPLETION OF COLLAGEN VI (COL VI) FOLLOWING SURGICALLY-INDUCED TMJ OA 2) THE PROTEOLYSIS OF A COL VI CHONDROCYTE RECEPTOR, NEURON/GLIAL ANTIGEN 2 (NG2) AND 3) THE REDUCTION OF AUTOPHAGY.

DESTRUCTIVE PERIODONTITIS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE LOSS OF DENTAL SUPPORTING TISSUES INCLUDING ALVEOLAR BONE. CLINICALLY, ALVEOLAR BONE LOSS CAN BE BROADLY DIVIDED INTO VERTICAL (INTRABONY) AND HORIZONTAL (SUPRABONY) BONE LOSS. SURPRISINGLY, HORIZONTAL BONE LOSS IN PERIODONTITIS IS THE MOST COMMON PROBLEM CONFRONTING CLINICIANS BUT HAS RECEIVED SCANT ATTENTION. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO PRODUCTS OFFERING SATISFACTORY OUTCOMES FOR THE TREATMENT OF HORIZONTAL ALVEOLAR BONE LOSS. THEREFORE, IT IS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE BIOMATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY FOR HORIZONTAL ALVEOLAR BONE REGENERATION. IN THE PRELIMINARY STUDIES, A MULTIFUNCTIONAL INJECTABLE NANOFIBROUS ECM-MIMICKING MICROSPHERE (MINE-MS) SYSTEM WITH SEVERAL UNIQUE FEATURES WAS DESIGNED AND FABRICATED. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE HIGH MECHANICAL STRENGTH, EXCELLENT INJECTABILITY AND CYTOCOMPATIBILITY, FAST SETTING TIME, STRONG ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY, AND HIGH OSTEOINDUCTIVITY. IN ADDITION, A SHORT PEPTIDE E7 THAT HAS HIGH SPECIFIC AFFINITY TO BONE MARROW DERIVED MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS (BMSCS) AND REPELS EPITHELIAL AND GINGIVAL FIBROBLAST CELLS WAS IDENTIFIED.

WHILE MANY FACTORS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE PROCESS OF TOOTH MORPHOGENESIS, CURRENTLY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW CELL SIGNALING PARTICIPATES IN ESTABLISHING ORGAN SHAPE DURING ODONTOGENESIS. OUR PREVIOUS WORK HAS IDENTIFIED THE SIGNALING MOLECULE RETINOIC ACID (RA) TO BE ONE OF THE MAIN ACTORS OF TOOTH INDUCTION IN FISH AND RECENT DATA SUGGEST THAT RA ALSO PLAYS A ROLE DURING TOOTH MORPHOGENESIS. FISH AND ZEBRAFISH, IN PARTICULAR, ARE GOOD MODELS TO STUDY GENETICS, CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, AND ORGANOGENESIS OF THE TOOTH IN VERTEBRATES.

CURRENT METHODS TO TREAT THESE CONDITIONS RELY ON PROCEDURES TO HARVEST AND IMPLANT BONE AUTOGRAFTS, WHICH ARE COSTLY, INVASIVE AND DIFFICULT TO SCALE UP. THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES ARE SYNTHETIC BONE REPLACEMENT MATERIALS, WHICH SHOW HIGH FAILURE RATES AND FAIL TO MIMIC THE NATIVE BONE STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION AND OSTEOGENIC PROPERTIES.

OUR PIONEERING R21 STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT PG-INDUCED PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 GROUP IIA (PLA2-IIA), IN A MECHANISM THAT INVOLVES ACTIVATION OF NOTCH-1 RECEPTOR (N1R) BY PG GINGIPAINS, MODULATES THE ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF ORAL EPITHELIAL CELLS (OECS). THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH IN VIVO AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE POTENT (NG/ML) ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF PLA2-IIA. NOTEWORTHY, ORAL BACTERIAL SPECIES EXHIBITED DIFFERENTIAL ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PLA2-IIA. MOREOVER, GINGIVAL PLA2-IIA EXPRESSION AND N1R ACTIVATION WERE ELEVATED DURING INITIATION AND PROGRESSION OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE, WHICH WAS CONCURRENT WITH ORAL DYSBIOSIS IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES. IN AGREEMENT WITH THESE OBSERVATIONS, NEW PRELIMINARY STUDIES USING MICE MODELS DEMONSTRATED INCREASED GINGIVAL PLA2-IIA EXPRESSION AND N1R ACTIVATION EARLY AFTER PG INFECTION. REMARKABLY, THE ORAL MICROBIOME OF TRANSGENIC MICE OVEREXPRESSING PLA2-IIA (PLA2-IIA-TG) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE ABUNDANCE OF BACTERIAL SPECIES (DECREASED FIRMICUTES AND INCREASED PROTEOBACTERIA) COMPARED TO THEIR WILD TYPE CO-CAGED LITTERMATES. ORAL DYSBIOSIS IN PLA2-IIA-TG MICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE GINGIVAL EXPRESSION OF GENES INVOLVED IN INTRACELLULAR SENSING (NOD2), CLASSICAL ANTIMICROBIAL FACTORS (S100A8/S100A9, HBD1), AND M1/M2 MACROPHAGE CHEMOKINES. N1R IS A CRITICAL MODULATOR OF MUCOSAL IMMUNITY; THEREFORE, THE ABILITY OF PG TO ACTIVATE N1R IN OECS IS AN EXCITING AND INNOVATIVE OBSERVATION. PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGESTED THAT OTHER OEC FUNCTIONS/RESPONSES (BACTERIAL SENSING, APOPTOSIS, AND AUTOPHAGY) COULD INVOLVE PG-INDUCED N1R ACTIVATION. BASED ON THIS EVIDENCE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ACTIVATION OF NOTCH-1/PLA2-IIA PATHWAY IN GINGIVAL EPITHELIAL SURFACES WOULD BE AN INNOVATIVE AND PLAUSIBLE MECHANISM BY WHICH PATHOGENS SUCH AS PG COULD SPECIFICALLY ENHANCE ORAL DYSBIOSIS, INFLAMMATION AND PERIODONTAL DISEASE.

A BACTERIAL TRIAD KNOWN AS THE `RED-COMPLEX' COMPRISING OF PORPHYROMONAS GINGIVALIS, TREPONEMA DENTICOLA AND TANNERELLA FORSYTHIA IS STRONGLY IMPLICATED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF THE DISEASE. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD WHY THESE THREE PATHOGENS ARE SO INFLUENTIAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERIODONTITIS. WHILE THESE BACTERIA PRODUCE A NUMBER OF FACTORS TO FACILITATE THEIR COLONIZATION, UNDERMINE HOST IMMUNITY AND PROMOTE SUBGINGIVAL POLYMICROBIAL SYNERGY AND DYSBIOSIS, INTRIGUINGLY, ALL THREE PATHOGENS PRODUCE SIALIDASE (NEURAMINIDASE) - AN ENZYME THAT CAN CLEAVE TERMINAL SIALIC ACID FROM GLYCOPROTEINS ON THE SURFACE OF EPITHEILIAL CELLS, IMMUNE CELLS AND IN SALIVARY AND GINGIVAL CREVICULAR SECRETIONS. WE HYPOTHEISIZE THAT SIALIDASE ACTIVITY OF THESE PATHOGENS PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE PATHOGENESIS VIA DISRUPTION OF STRUCTURE-FUNCTION ACTIVITY OF INNATE IMMUNE FACTORS AND LIBERATION OF SIALIC ACID AS A NUTRIENT AS WELL AS A PRECURSOR FOR SURFACE SIALYLATION AND SYNTHESIS OF VITAL BACTERIAL COMPONENTS SUCH AS PEPTIDOGLYCAN (BACTERIAL CELL-WALL).

THE NANH SIALIDASE ACTIVITY CAN PROMOTE EARLY BACTERIAL-EPITHELIAL CELL INTERACTIONS, CAUSE DISRUPTION OF INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES AND PROVIDE A MEANS FOR THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF MURNAC IN BIOFILMS AND LIKELY IMPROVES BACTERIUM'S SURVIVAL IN THE SUBGINGIVAL NICHE BY REDUCING ITS RELIANCE ON COHABITING BACTERIA TO PROVIDE MURNAC AND PEPTIDOGLYCAN FRAGMENTS.

THIS RESOLVES THE FORK AND ALLOWS BIR TO CONTINUE REPLICATION, ALBEIT WITH LOW FIDELITY. WE PRESENT DATA DEMONSTRATING THAT WRN IS A RESTRICTION FACTOR FOR THE HPV16 LIFE CYCLE; IN THE ABSENCE OF WRN THERE IS INCREASED CELL PROLIFERATION, DNA DAMAGE AND VIRAL REPLICATION IN ORGANOTYPIC RAFT CULTURES. WE OBSERVED A SIMILAR PHENOTYPE FOLLOWING SAMHD1 DEPLETION, ANOTHER HR FACTOR. WRN AND SAMHD1 ARE IN THE SAME CELLULAR COMPLEX ALONG WITH OTHER DDR FACTORS INVOLVED IN HPV LIFE CYCLES. OUR FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE ROLES OF THE WRN-SAMHD1 COMPLEX IN CONTROLLING HPV LIFE CYCLES. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THIS COMPLEX CONTROLS HIGH FIDELITY REPLICATION DURING THE VIRAL LIFE CYCLE, AND THAT TARGETING COMPONENTS OF THIS COMPLEX ALONG WITH MUS81 MAY BLOCK HPV REPLICATION. USING A NOVEL HPV16 GENOME, WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE LEVELS AND THE FIDELITY OF VIRAL REPLICATION DURING THE VIRAL LIFE CYCLE. OUR SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE ALTERED HOST DNA REPLICATION FORKS IN HPV16 POSITIVE CELLS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT DIFFERENCES CAN BE EXPLOITED FOR DIFFERENTIAL TARGETING OF HPV POSITIVE CELLS. THIS WILL BE DONE IN ASSOCIATION WITH PIETRO PICHIERRI, A WRN AND DNA REPLICATION AND REPAIR EXPERT; MORGAN AND PICHIERRI HAVE ALREADY PUBLISHED TOGETHER. OUR THIRD OBJECTIVE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE ACTIVATION OF THE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE (IIR) IN HPV16 CELLS DEPLETED FOR WRN AND SAMHD1. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT DEPLETION OF WRN OR SAMHD1 IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ACTIVE DDR IN HPV16 CELLS RESULTS IN EXCESS CYTOPLASMIC DNA FRAGMENTS THAT ACTIVATE THE IIR. THE OUTCOMES ARE CRUCIAL FOR ACHIEVING OUR LONG-TERM GOALS. FOR EXAMPLE, TARGETING OF WRN ENZYME ACTIVITIES COULD BOOST THE IIR IN HPV16 POSITIVE CELLS, ASSISTING THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE (AND IMMUNOTHERAPY) TO ELIMINATE HPV POSITIVE CELLS. IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT FACTORS REPLICATING HOST DNA IN THE PRESENCE OF HPV, THESE COULD BE TARGETED TO PREFERENTIALLY KILL HPV POSITIVE CELLS.

OVERCOME THE EFFECTS OF A HARMFUL GENETIC MUTATION. WE GENERATED A ZEBRAFISH MODEL OF BUFFERING IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN SICK ARE SOMEHOW ABLE TO LIVE UNAFFECTED HEALTHY LIVES. IN OUR MODEL, WE USED SELECTIVE BREEDING TO GENERATE TWO STRAINS OF ZEBRAFISH THAT DEVELOP DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT HEAD SKELETONS IN RESPONSE TO THE SAME HARMFUL GENETIC MUTATION. IN ONE STRAIN, THE MUTATION CAUSES SEVERE, LETHAL SKELETAL DEFECTS. MEANWHILE, THE OTHER STRAIN IS REMARKABLY BUFFERED AGAINST THE MUTATION. THE BUFFERED FISH DEVELOP ESSENTIALLY NORMAL HEAD SKELETONS, SURVIVING TO BE FERTILE, VIABLE ADULTS. WE COMPARE THESE STRAINS TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURAL BUFFERING MECHANISMS THAT ARE PRESENT IN SOME FISH, AND LIKELY IN SOME HUMANS TOO. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BUFFERING IS DUE TO FACTORS THAT TUNE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES TO RESTORE BALANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN AIM1 WE WILL DETERMINE HOW DNA SEQUENCES WHICH OPPOSE THE MUTANT GENE CAN BE TURNED DOWN. IN AIM 2 WE EXAMINE HOW FACTORS ENCODED IN THE DNA WHICH PERFORM THE SAME FUNCTION AS THE MUTANT GENE CAN BE TURNED UP. IN AIM 3 WE WILL DETERMINE HOW CHANGES THAT DO NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE ALTERATIONS IN THE DNA SEQUENCE CAN BUFFER THE HARMFUL MUTATION. THESE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS TEST HOW INTERACTING MECHANISMS FUNCTION TOGETHER TO BUFFER DEVELOPMENT. WE DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE AIMS USING STATE OF THE ART METHODS LIKE GENOME EDITING AND SEQUENCING, COLORFUL CELL AND TISSUE LABELING, QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF LARGE NUMBERS OF FISH SKELETONS, AND RIGOROUS STATISTICAL ANALYSES. THE MECHANISMS WE PROPOSE TO STUDY HERE ARE PRESENT IN MANY DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS AND ORGANISMS AND THEREFORE WILL LIKELY BE APPLICABLE IN WIDE- RANGING SETTINGS.

CURRENTLY, HOW DIVERSE POPULATIONS OF DENTAL ROOT MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELLS WORK TOGETHER AND GENERATE HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL TOOTH ROOTS REMAINS UNKNOWN. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE WILL DEFINE HOW CONCERTED ACTIONS OF DISTINCT CLASSES OF DENTAL ROOT MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELLS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PROPER FORMATION AND REGENERATION OF THE TOOTH ROOT ACCOMPANIED BY A FUNCTIONAL PERIODONTAL ATTACHMENT APPARATUS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL DEFINE HOW HEDGEHOG-FOX PATHWAY REGULATES DF MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELLS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE FORKHEAD (FOX) TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN REGULATING PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF HEDGEHOG-RESPONSIVE DF MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELLS. WE WILL FIRST REVEAL THE DIVERSITY OF HEDGEHOG-RESPONSIVE GLI1+ DF CELLS USING SINGLE CELL RNA- SEQ ANALYSES, AND DETERMINE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PTHRP+ DF CELLS AND OTHER PRECURSOR CELL POPULATIONS. SECOND, WE WILL DETERMINE THE FUNCTION OF GLI1+, PTHRP+ AND RUNX2+ CELLS IN PERIODONTIUM FORMATION USING INDUCIBLE CELL ABLATION EXPERIMENTS, AND FURTHER TEST THE FUNCTION OF FOXF1 AND FOXF2 IN PERIODONTIUM FORMATION USING THEIR FLOXED ALLELES. IN AIM 2, WE WILL IDENTIFY WNT-MEDIATED ROLES OF APICAL ROOT MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELLS IN TOOTH ROOT FORMATION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT CHEMOKINE (C-X-C MOTIF) LIGAND 12 (CXCL12)+ MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELLS IN THE APICAL ROOT AREA ORCHESTRATE FORMATION OF THE TOOTH ROOT AND THE APICAL PERIODONTIUM IN A CANONICAL WNT SIGNALING-MEDIATED MANNER. WE WILL DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CXCL12+ CELLS AND STEM CELLS FOR APICAL PAPILLA (SCAP) USING EX VIVO CULTURE SYSTEM, AND DEFINE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING A WNT-MEDIATED CELL FATE CHOICE OF MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELLS BY A COMPARATIVE RNA-SEQ ANALYSIS FOLLOWED BY IN SITU VALIDATION. IN AIM 3, WE WILL DETERMINE ACTIONS OF DENTAL ROOT MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELLS IN PERIODONTAL REGENERATION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DISTINCT CLASSES OF DENTAL ROOT MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELLS CONTRIBUTE TO REGENERATION IN A CONCERTED MANNER. WE WILL DEFINE HOW DESCENDANTS OF GLI1+, PTHRP+, RUNX2+ AND CXCL12+ PROGENITOR CELLS CONTRIBUTE TO PERIODONTAL REGENERATION AFTER BONE DESTRUCTION, BY UTILIZING A LIGATURE-INDUCED PERIODONTITIS MODEL MIMICKING PERIODONTAL DISEASES, AND A SURGICAL PERIODONTAL DEFECT MODEL.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null,

ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN PORPHYROMONAS GINGIVALIS, DYSBIOSIS OF THE COMMENSAL MICROBIOTA IN THE SUBGINGIVAL CREVICE, AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION RESULTING IN BONE RESORPTION, AND ULTIMATELY TOOTH LOSS. VITAMIN D IS BEST KNOWN AS A PRINCIPAL FACTOR THAT MAINTAINS CALCIUM HOMEOSTASIS AND IS REQUIRED FOR BONE DEVELOPMENT AND HOMEOSTASIS. HOWEVER, IT IS BECOMING CLEAR THAT VITAMIN D HAS PROFOUND ACTIONS IN IMMUNITY AND INFLAMMATION AS WELL. BOTH THE CHRONIC AND AGGRESSIVE FORMS OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY IN NUMEROUS POPULATIONS. OUR RECENTLY PUBLISHED DATA SHOW THAT THE ACTIVE FORM OF VITAMIN D, 1,25(OH)2D3, PROMOTES ANTI-BACTERIAL ACTIVITY AGAINST P. GINGIVALIS BY GINGIVAL EPITHELIAL CELLS (GEC), AND INHIBITS PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE EXPRESSION. EXPERIMENTAL VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY IN MICE LEADS TO GINGIVAL INFLAMMATION AND BONE LOSS. HOWEVER, CLINICAL TRIALS EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF ORAL VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION ON PERIODONTAL DISEASE HAVE LED TO CONFLICTING RESULTS, LIKELY DUE TO NATURAL FEEDBACK MECHANISMS. WE THEREFORE HYPOTHESIZED THAT TOPICAL ADMINISTRATION OF VITAMIN D TO THE GINGIVA COULD CIRCUMVENT THIS PROBLEM. OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT WHEN INACTIVE VITAMIN D IS DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE GINGIVAL EPITHELIUM, BOTH IN VITRO AND IN MICE, WE OBSERVE A RAPID INDUCTION OF VITAMIN D-MEDIATED GENES, AS WELL AS AN INHIBITION OF PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, WITHOUT CYTOTOXICITY. WE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE EPITHELIAL CELLS CONVERT INACTIVE VITAMIN D3 TO BOTH THE INACTIVE INTERMEDIATE (25OHD3), AND TO ACTIVE 1,25(OH)2D3 THROUGH EPITHELIAL CELL- EXPRESSED HYDROXYLASES, AND THAT THIS CONVERSION RESULTED IN INCREASED PRODUCTION OF THE HOST DEFENSE PEPTIDE, LL-37. THUS, OUR OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THAT THE GINGIVAL EPITHELIUM MAINTAINS ITS OWN INTRINSIC REGULATION OF VITAMIN D STATUS, AND THAT TOPICAL DELIVERY OF VITAMIN D TO THE ORAL EPITHELIUM ALLOWS DIRECT INTRODUCTION OF HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF ACTIVE VITAMIN D TO THE TISSUE. THIS DELIVERY CAN LEAD TO REGULATION OF VITAMIN D-REGULATED GENES THAT CAN DOWNREGULATE INFLAMMATION AND PREVENT THE GROWTH OF PERIOPATHOGENIC BACTERIA, AND THE RESULTING BONE LOSS. TO ADDRESS THIS, WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) QUANTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VITAMIN D AND PERIODONTAL DISEASE IN A MOUSE MODEL. 2) DEFINE THE SHIFTS IN THE ORAL MICROBIOME REGULATED BY VITAMIN D. 3) CHARACTERIZE THE MECHANISM OF VITAMIN D-MEDIATED INDUCTION OF INNATE IMMUNITY IN CULTURED HUMAN GEC.

MANAGEMENT REQUIRES A TAILORED AND, AT TIMES, DISPARATE APPROACH TO CORRECT THE FACIAL DISABILITY RANGING FROM NON-SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS TO FACIAL REANIMATION SURGERY. SURGEONS\u2019 PLAN TREATMENT BASED ON MEASUREMENTS MADE FROM 2D IMAGES AND SUBJECTIVE GRADING OF THE PATIENT\u2019S FACE, BOTH OF WHICH ARE LIMITED IN SCOPE AND DIMENSION.

THE DATA FROM THESE GROUPS WILL BE COMPARED WITH PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED DATA FROM HISTORICAL CONTROLS. THE NULL HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED IS THAT THERE WILL BE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE IMPACT OF THE SURGICAL CHANGE ON FACIAL DISABILITY (PRIMARY HO) OR ON PATIENT PERCEPTION (SECONDARY HO) EFFECTED BY THE THREE DIFFERENT SURGICAL APPROACHES FOR FACIAL/SMILE REANIMATION AFTER CONTROLLING FOR PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS.

TMJ IS COMPOSED OF THE MANDIBULAR CONDYLE, TEMPORAL BONE, AND A DISC WITH ABUNDANT TENDON ATTACHMENTS. TENDON HAS BEEN THOUGHT TO PLAY THE SOLE FUNCTION OF TRANSMITTING MUSCLE FORCES TO STABILIZE JOINTS, YET IT IS LARGELY UNCLEAR WHY TENDON UNDERGOES ECTOPIC OSSIFICATION IN TRAUMA OR DISEASES, AND WHETHER IT HAS ANY DIRECT CONTRIBUTION TO SKELETAL FORMATION. TO INVESTIGATE THE FULL BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF TENDON IN TMJ POSTNATAL GROWTH AND EXPANSION, A SERIES OF IN VIVO EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED. THE KEY FINDINGS ARE A. THE TMJ CONDYLE IS COMPOSED OF A WELL-ESTABLISHED CARTILAGE HEAD AND AN OVERLOOKED BONY HEAD THAT GROWS AFTER BIRTH AND CONTINUOUSLY EXPANDS DURING LIFESPAN; B. THE TENDON-ATTACHED BONY HEAD, RAMUS, AND TEMPORAL BONE SHARE UNIQUE FEATURES IN MINERAL PATTERN, CELL MORPHOLOGY, AND ECM (EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX) PROFILES, WHICH ARE DISTINCT FROM CONVENTIONAL BONE (SUCH AS PERIOSTEUM-FORMED BONE, PFB); C. THIS NEWLY IDENTIFIED BONE TISSUE (NAMED TENDON-FORMED BONE, TFB) ORIGINATES FROM SCX+ (SCLERAXIS) TENDON CELLS VIA AN INTERFACE, AND INVADES THE ADJACENT CARTILAGE OR BONE TO FORM A TIGHT CONNECTION BEYOND A SIMPLE ATTACHMENT BETWEEN TENDON AND BONE; D. HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA ACCELERATES CELL PROLIFERATION AND TRANSDIFFERENTIATION OF THE AVASCULAR TENDON TO TFB, RESULTING IN A MALFORMED TMJ; AND E. MATURE SCX+ TENDON CELLS RAPIDLY AND ROBUSTLY SWITCH THEIR FATE TO CARTILAGE AND BONE CELLS UPON TMJ TRAUMA, GIVING RISE TO A SELF-REPAIR OR ANKYLOSIS. THESE NOVEL FINDINGS RAISE THE FOLLOWING CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS: TENDON CELLS, BEYOND THEIR CONVENTIONAL ROLE IN JOINT MOVEMENT, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POSTNATAL GROWTH AND EXPANSION OF TMJ CONDYLE HEAD, RAMUS, AND TEMPORAL BONE, AS WELL AS A KEY PLAYER DURING TMJ TRAUMA REPAIR AND ANKYLOSIS ONSET. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, TWO HIGHLY RELATED, YET INDEPENDENT SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED: 1) TO DEFINE NOVEL ROLES OF TENDON IN FORMING BONE CELLS OF THE BONY CONDYLE HEAD AND RAMUS, WHICH ARE DISTINCT FROM CONVENTIONAL BONE IN CELL MORPHOLOGY, ECM COMPONENTS, AND MINERALIZATION; 2) TO DEFINE NOVEL ROLES OF TENDON DURING TMJ TEMPORAL BONE GROWTH, AS WELL AS THE PLASTICITY OF ADULT TENDON CELLS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRAUMA-INDUCED TMJ ANKYLOSIS. UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED WORK, IT IS EXPECTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A) SCX+ TENDON CELLS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE POSTNATAL GROWTH AND EXPANSION OF TMJ BONY HEAD, RAMUS, AND TEMPORAL BONE THROUGH A CELL TRANSDIFFERENTIATION MECHANISM; AND B) ADULT TENDON CELLS PARTICIPATE IN TMJ REPAIR AND ANKYLOSIS ONSET UPON TRAUMA BY SHIFTING THEIR CELL FATE TO CHONDROCYTES AND BONE CELLS. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY WILL FILL KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN THIS LARGELY UNKNOWN BUT VITAL AREA, REVISE THE CURRENT DOGMA BY RAISING A NEW TYPE OF TENDON-DERIVED BONE, AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING

"93.121", "Description": "IMMUNE EVASION MECHANISMS BY A TUMOR HERPESVIRUS IN THE ORAL CAVITY - ABSTRACT KAPOSI\u2019S SARCOMA-ASSOCIATED HERPESVIRUS (KSHV) IS LARGE DNA VIRUS, WHICH IS THE ETIOLOGICAL AGENT OF SEVERAL AIDS-RELATED MALIGNANCIES SUCH AS KAPOSI\u2019S SARCOMA, PRIMARY EFFUSION LYMPHOMA, AND AGGRESSIVE FORMS OF MULTICENTRIC CASTLEMAN\u2019S DISEASE. LYTIC REPLICATION OF KSHV IS CRITICAL FOR BOTH KSHV-INDUCED TUMORIGENESIS AND DISSEMINATION OF THE VIRUS. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FOLLOWING REPLICATION IN THE ORAL EPITHELIAL CELLS, KSHV CAN BE TRANSMITTED INTO ENDOTHELIAL AND B CELLS WHERE THE VIRUS ESTABLISHES LATENCY RESULTING PERSISTENT INFECTION OF THE HOST. INFECTED ORAL EPITHELIAL CELLS ALSO SERVE AS THE SOURCE OF NEW VIRAL PARTICLES SHEDDING INTO THE SALIVA, WHICH MEDIATES THE VIRAL TRANSMISSION IN THE POPULATION. DESPITE THE MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF ORAL KSHV INFECTION, IT IS STILL LARGELY UNKNOWN WHAT VIRAL AND HOST FACTORS PLAY A ROLE IN THE REGULATION OF LYTIC KSHV INFECTION OF ORAL EPITHELIAL CELLS. KSHV IS UNIQUE AMONG HUMAN VIRUSES THAT IT ENCODES FOUR VIRAL INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTORS THAT ARE HOMOLOGOUS TO CELLULAR IRFS. THESE VIRAL PROTEINS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REGULATE MANY DIFFERENT IMMUNE-RELATED PATHWAYS AND CAN ENHANCE CELL GROWTH AND CELL SURVIVAL. WHILE MANY OF THESE VIRF FUNCTIONS ARE LINKED TO THE CYTOPLASMIC FUNCTIONS OF VIRFS, THE NUCLEAR ROLE OF VIRFS IN GENE REGULATION, ESPECIALLY IN ORAL EPITHELIAL CELLS, THAT MAY PROMOTE LYTIC KSHV INFECTION IS STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. TO REVEAL THE ROLE OF VIRFS IN VIRAL AND CELLULAR GENE REGULATION, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE HOST TARGET GENES OF EACH VIRF IN PRIMARY HUMAN GINGIVAL EPITHELIAL CELLS AND REVEALED A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED FUNCTION FOR EACH VIRF. IN ADDITION, WE PERFORMED A PROTEIN COMPLEX PURIFICATION OF VIRF1 FROM KSHV-INFECTED CELLS AND DISCOVERED THAT VIRF1 CAN INTERACT WITH SEVERAL HOST EPIGENETIC FACTORS INVOLVED IN DNA BINDING, HISTONE ACETYLATION OR HISTONE METHYLATION. BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA, THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS (AIM 1) TO IDENTIFY THE DIRECT TARGET GENES OF VIRFS AND TEST THEIR ROLE IN LYTIC KSHV INFECTION, AND (AIM 2) TO INVESTIGATE THE GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS MEDIATED BY VIRF1 AND ITS ASSOCIATED HOST EPIGENETIC FACTORS, WHICH CAN BE CRITICAL FOR FACILITATING LYTIC REPLICATION OF KSHV. SINCE MANY OF THE VIRF1-REGULATED HOST GENES ENCODE FACTORS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE DE-REGULATED IN OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS AS WELL, WE ENVISION THAT THE INVESTIGATION OF EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS AND HOST GENE TARGETS OF VIRF1 DURING KSHV INFECTION CAN PROVIDE NOVEL TARGETS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State

ALTHOUGH THE FETAL LUNG IS RICHLY INNERVATED DURING DEVELOPMENT, THE CONNECTIVITY TO THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS), THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE NEURONS HELP ORCHESTRATE LUNG AND CNS FORMATION OVER THE COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT, AND THE ROLE THEY PLAY IN FUNCTION AT BIRTH REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN. THIS R01 APPLICATION PROPOSES TO ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP USING A NOVEL FETAL SHEEP MODEL.  WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC LUNG INTEROCEPTIVE UNITS PLAY A ROLE IN THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE LUNG AND CENTRAL RESPIRATORY CONTROL CENTERS. WE WILL TEST THIS IN THE FOLLOWING AIMS: AIM 1: TRADITIONAL DYE AND NOVEL VIRAL TRACK TRACER TECHNIQUES WILL BE USED IN FETAL SHEEP AT VARIOUS STAGES OF LUNG DEVELOPMENT TO DELINEATE THE LOCATION AND CONNECTIVITY OF THE INTEROCEPTIVE UNITS WITHIN THE LUNG, AS WELL AS FIRST- AND SECOND-ORDER CENTRAL CIRCUITRY TO AND ABOVE THE BRAINSTEM.

UNTREATED, PERIODONTITIS CAN ERODE THE TISSUES THAT SUPPORT THE TEETH, ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN TOOTH LOSS, AS WELL AS INCREASED RISK FOR SEVERAL CO-MORBIDITIES (E.G., DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, AND CANCER). IN CONTRAST TO CLASSIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES, PERIODONTITIS IS TRIGGERED BY THE OUTGROWTH OF MULTIPLE (RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL) \u201cPATHOGENS\u201d - PRO-INFLAMMATORY, NORMALLY LOW-LEVEL CONSTITUENTS OF THE ORAL-CAVITY MICROBIOTA. THESE PATHOGENS EXPAND BY METABOLICALLY EXPLOITING LOCAL TISSUE DAMAGE, WHILE ALSO EXCRETING METABOLITES THAT SUSTAIN FURTHER INFLAMMATION. A KEY EXAMPLE IS HYDROGEN SULFIDE. THIS PRO-INFLAMMATORY METABOLITE IS PRODUCED IN PROLIFIC AMOUNTS BY PERIODONTAL PATHOGENS, DUE TO THEIR INCREASED ACCESS TO TISSUE DAMAGE-DERIVED, SULFUR-CONTAINING AMINO ACIDS - CYSTEINE, METHIONINE, AND TAURINE. IN OUR FUNDED PARENT AWARD (R00 THROUGH NIDCR), WE FOCUS ON CYSTEINE/METHIONINE AND A PARTICULAR MECHANISM BY WHICH THEIR DEGRADATION TO SULFIDE, SPECIFICALLY BY THE PATHOGEN FUSOBACTERIUM NUCLEATUM, CAN POTENTIALLY EXACERBATE PERIODONTITIS: INFLAMMATION TRIGGERED BY F. NUCLEATUM-DERIVED SULFIDE CONSTRUCTS A METABOLIC NICHE THAT ENABLES EXPANSION OF A PROMINENT CO-PATHOGEN (AGGREGATIBACTER ACTINOMYCETEMCOMITANS). UNLIKE F. NUCLEATUM, OTHER PATHOGENS WITHIN THE ORAL MICROBIOTA CAN DEGRADE TAURINE. YET, WHETHER SULFIDE FROM TAURINE-DEGRADING PATHOGENS CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO PERIODONTITIS HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING SINCE TAURINE IS WIDELY CONSUMED AS A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT DUE TO ITS MANY PURPORTED HEALTH BENEFITS. INDEED, IN A PROJECT SUPPORTED BY THE OFFICE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS (ODS) RESEARCH SCHOLARS PROGRAM, WE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT WHEN PROVIDED PROPHYLACTICALLY, DIETARY TAURINE-DERIVED SULFIDE CAN ENHANCE THE MICROBIOTA\u2019S RESISTANCE TO INVADING PATHOGENS. HOWEVER, IN THE CONTEXT OF PRE-EXISTING INFLAMMATION, SUCH AS PERIODONTITIS, TAURINE-DERIVED SULFIDE MAY INSTEAD EXACERBATE DISEASE. IN THIS ODS ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT, WE PROPOSE TESTING THIS EXACT POSSIBILITY.

NUCLEATUM, THE TAURINE-DEGRADING PATHOGEN BILOPHILA WADSWORTHIA CAN ENHANCE PERIODONTAL DISEASE.

A MAIN SOURCE OF PPI IS ATP, WHICH IS HYDROLYZED BY ECTONUCLEOTIDE PYROPHOSPHATASE PHOSPHODIESTERASES (ENPP), INCLUDING ENPP1. ENPP1 IS EXPRESSED IN BONE ALONG WITH PROGRESSIVE ANKYLOSIS PROTEIN (ANK), WHICH TRANSPORTS INTRACELLULAR PPI TO EXTRACELLULAR SPACES.

THE SECOND MAIN GOAL OF THIS PHASE WAS TO ENHANCE THE DOUBLE TORSION FRACTURE TOUGHNESS TECHNIQUE TO ASSESS THE HEALING EFFICIENCY AND THE KINETICS OF THE CRACK PROPAGATION UNDER A MORE CLINICALLY RELEVANT SCENARIO. COLLECTED DATA HAS HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE INCORPORATION OF THE MICROCAPSULES INTO THE THERMOSETTING POLYMERIC NETWORKS CHANGES DRAMATICALLY THE KINETICS OF THE CRACK FORMATION AND PROPAGATION. THEREFORE, IN THE INDEPENDENT PHASE OF THIS PROPOSAL, THE CRACK GROWTH KINETICS AND THE POLYMER HEALING WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORED BY THE INCORPORATION OF FLUORESCENT DYES INTO THE ENCAPSULATED HEALING AGENTS, THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECTS PROMOTED BY THE ADDITION OF THE MICROCAPSULES IN SYSTEMS CONTAINING THE UNREACTED COMPOUND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL DIBUTANOATE, AND THE USE OF DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION (DIC) TECHNOLOGY. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE TOUGH HEALING AGENT, SHELL WALL FUNCTIONALIZATION, AND INTRODUCTION OF CEHDA METHOD TO PRODUCE CAPSULES WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL AND VIABILITY OF SELF-HEALING DENTAL MATERIALS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL BROADLY IMPACT THE FIELD BY MODIFYING AND IMPROVING ESSENTIAL SELF-HEALING COMPONENTS AND DEVELOPING AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR ENCAPSULATION PROCESS, MAKING THIS APPROACH A TANGIBLE RESOURCE FOR RESIN COMPOSITES SURVIVAL.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OR", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "27f21ab2-7b66-cad9-be60-5f435f28b02f-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_R00DE028876_7529"}, {"internal_id": 149791585, "Award ID": "R00DE028592", "Award Amount": 605010.44, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-06-23", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ROLES AND REGULATION OF DRAXIN IN CRANIAL NEURAL CREST - PROJECT SUMMARY  THE NEURAL CREST (NC) IS A STEM CELL POPULATION THAT ORIGINATES WITHIN THE FORMING CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. NC CELLS DELAMINATE FROM THE NEUROEPITHELIUM BY UNDERGOING A SPATIOTEMPORALLY REGULATED EPITHELIAL-TO- MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION (EMT) THAT PROCEEDS IN A COORDINATED WAVE HEAD-TO-TAIL TO EXIT FROM THE NEURAL TUBE. CRANIAL NC CELLS, WHICH ARISE IN THE HEAD REGION OF THE EMBRYO AND ARE THE ONLY NC POPULATION IN VIVO WITH THE ABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE INTO CRANIOFACIAL SKELETON AND CARTILAGE, ARE INDISPENSABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACE; MUTATIONS AFFECTING NC DEVELOPMENT RESULT IN NUMEROUS DISEASES AND MALFORMATIONS AFFECTING THE CRANIOFACIAL STRUCTURES (E.G. TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME, CLEFT PALATE, ETC.). THUS, A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE REGULATION OF CRANIAL NC EMT IS ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY THE ETIOLOGY OF CRANIOFACIAL ABNORMALITIES.  TO DATE, RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON UNRAVELING EARLY EVENTS GOVERNING CRANIAL NC INDUCTION AT THE NEURAL PLATE BORDER AND THE MECHANISM OF DELAMINATION FROM THE NEURAL TUBE. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE REGULATORY CHANGES GOVERNING THE TIMING OF NC EMT AND EXIT FROM THE NEURAL TUBE. MY PRELIMINARY STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT A WNT PATHWAY ANTAGONIST, DRAXIN, PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONTROLLING THE TIMING OF NC EMT, PERTURBATIONS OF WHICH HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR CRANIAL NC MIGRATION. THIS ROLE FOR DRAXIN IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A MAJOR DRIVER OF NC DEVELOPMENT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM BY WHICH DRAXIN AFFECTS CRANIAL NC EMT, WITH FOCUS ON ITS ROLE IN WNT SIGNALING. TO THIS END, THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROPOSAL SEEK TO COMBINE CHICK EMBRYOLOGY WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART IMAGING AND BIOCHEMISTRY TO:  1) CHARACTERIZE THE INTERACTION OF DRAXIN AND WNT SIGNALING IN CRANIAL NC EMT;  2) IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF DRAXIN IN THE REGULATION OF CELL ADHESION PROTEINS;  3) CHARACTERIZE THE POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF DRAXIN; AND  4) IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF DRAXIN IN THE REGULATION OF EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEINS.

MEANWHILE, ORAL MUCOSA SERVES AS A BARRIER TO PROTECT THE UNDERLYING TISSUES, WHICH IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE CONTINUAL REPLACEMENT OF CELLS ORIGINATING FROM A PRESUMABLE RESERVOIR OF STEM CELLS IN THE BASAL LAYER. CURRENTLY, THE IDENTITY OF STEM CELLS IN ORAL MUCOSA IS LARGELY UNKNOWN, PREVENTING FURTHER MECHANISTIC STUDIES TO FULLY UN- DERSTAND THEIR SELF-RENEWAL, DIFFERENTIATION AND REGENERATION CAPACITY. I HAVE DEVELOPED A REPERTOIRE OF TRANSGENIC LINEAGE TRACING MICE AND IDENTIFIED A WNT-RESPONSIVE POPULATION THAT FUNCTIONS AS A STEM CELL POOL IN THE ORAL EPITHELIA. IN THIS PROPOSED PROJECT, I WILL THOROUGHLY CHARACTERIZE THE CONTRIBUTION(S) OF THESE WNT-RESPONSIVE STEM CELLS IN ORAL MUCOSA DURING HOMEOSTASIS (AIM1), INJURY REPAIR (AIM2), AND MALIGNANCY (AIM3). MY CENTRAL HYPOTH- ESIS IS THAT IN ORAL MUCOSA, WNT-RESPONSIVE CELLS MAINTAIN THE TISSUE INTEGRITY AND EFFECTUATE THE REGENERATION FOLLOWING INJURY, AND MUTATION OF THIS SAME POPULATION INITIATES ORAL CANCER. THESE AIMS WILL UTILIZE LINEAGE TRACING, LINEAGE ABLATION, LABEL RETENTION, AND INJURY AND ORAL CANCER MODELS TO INTERROGATE STEM CELL MAINTENANCE, REGEN- ERATIVE DYNAMICS AS WELL AS THE CELLS OF ORIGIN IN CANCER. THESE STUDIES ARE DESIGNED TO ENRICH OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF STEM CELLS IN ORAL MUCOSA AND HOW THOSE CELLS CONTRIBUTE TO THE INTEGRITY AND HEALING ABILITY OF ORAL MUCOSA. THIS UNDERSTUDIED AREA HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES FOR REGENERATION OF TISSUES IN THE CRANIOFACIAL COMPLEX, INCLUDING SKIN AND MUCOSA. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF CANCER STEM CELLS, PROVIDING NOVEL TARGETS FOR ORAL CANCER TREATMENT.

THE ZIKV OUTBREAKS IN THE AMERICAS AND SOUTHEAST ASIA IS A MAJOR GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERN, LARGELY DUE TO THE ASSOCIATION WITH FETAL CRANIOFACIAL ABNORMALITIES AND MALFORMATIONS, RESULTING FROM PRENATAL INFECTION. ALTHOUGH ZIKV INFECTION DURING PREGNANCY IS CASUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH MICROCEPHALY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT INTRACRANIAL CALCIFICATION IS THE MOST FREQUENT ABNORMALITY PRESENT IN ZIKV-POSITIVE BABIES. IN FACT, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STUDY OF BRAZILIAN LARGE ZIKV-POSITIVE BABY COHORT REPORTED THE INTRACRANIAL CALCIFICATIONS AS THE MOST COMMON CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS. WHILE CALCIFICATION OCCURS IN SOFT TISSUES, THE ABNORMAL DEPOSITION OF CALCIUM IN BRAIN NOT ONLY SEVERELY AFFECTS MOTOR FUNCTION, SPEECH ABILITY, AND VISION, BUT ALSO CAUSES SEIZURES. DESPITE THE GROWING CLINICAL EVIDENCES OF ZIKV-INDUCED CALCIFICATIONS AND THEIR POTENTIAL DIRE OUTCOMES, HOWEVER, THE ETIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF ZIKV-INDUCED BRAIN CALCIFICATION REMAIN ELUSIVE. MY PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS IN ZIKV HUMAN FETAL BRAIN SPECIMENS SHOWED THAT HIGH LEVEL OF CALCIUM DEPOSITS WAS LOCALIZED WITH VIRUS-INFECTED PERIVASCULAR CELLS. INTRIGUINGLY, ZIKV-INFECTION OF BRAIN PERIVASCULAR AND OSTEOGENIC PRECURSOR CELLS ROBUSTLY INDUCED CALCIFICATIONS IN VITRO. SURPRISINGLY, THE INDUCTION OF CALCIFICATION WAS LINEAGE-SPECIFIC TO THE ASIAN ZIKV STRAINS, BUT NOT TO THE AFRICAN ZIKV STRAINS. AFRICAN ZIKV STRAINS RAPIDLY REPLICATED, INDUCING CELL DEATH, WHILE ASIAN ZIKV STRAINS PERSISTENTLY REPLICATED, LEADING TO ABERRANT CALCIUM DEPOSITION. SURPRISINGLY, ZIKV EXPRESSION LIBRARY SCREEN SHOWED THAT NS3 PROTEASE WAS SUFFICIENT TO INDUCE CALCIFICATION. BASED ON THESE PRELIMINARY DATA, I HYPOTHESIZE THAT ZIKV TARGETS SPECIFIC HOST BRAIN PERIVASCULAR CELLS AND UTILIZES NS3 PROTEASE TO INDUCE INTRACRANIAL CALCIFICATIONS, WHICH ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTES TO VIRUS-ASSOCIATED CONGENITAL ABNORMALITY. HEREIN, I SEEK TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (I) WHICH HOST CELLS ARE TARGETED FOR ZIKV-INDUCED CALCIFICATIONS, AND (II AND III) WHICH AND HOW ZIKV NS3 PROTEASE TRIGGERS ABNORMAL CALCIFICATION DURING INFECTION.

THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN - PROJECT SUMMARY THE WISCONSIN HEAD AND NECK SPORE IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE TRANSLATIONAL LABORATORY AND CLINICAL RESEARCH TO IMPROVE OVERALL OUTCOME FOR PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCER (HNC). THIS HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH LINKS BASIC SCIENTISTS WITH HNC CLINICIANS TO ADVANCE NOVEL TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR THIS COMPLEX CANCER POPULATION. THESE PATIENTS BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN FROM THEIR CANCERS BASED ON THE CRITICAL ANATOMIC LOCATION OF THE DISEASE FOR WHICH TREATMENT CAN COMPROMISE SPEECH, SWALLOW, AND BREATHING FUNCTION, IN ADDITION TO CREATING SIGNIFICANT ALTERATIONS IN PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND CAPACITY FOR SOCIAL INTERACTION. EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CURE RATES MUST BE CAREFULLY BALANCED WITH EFFORTS TO REDUCE TREATMENT TOXICITY TO ENABLE ENHANCED OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS. THE BROAD OBJECTIVES OF THIS SPORE ARE TO: 1) PROMOTE MULTIDISCIPLINARY TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN HNC, 2) IMPROVE OVERALL SURVIVAL AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS WITH HNC, 3) INCORPORATE NEW PREDICTIVE MODELS TO TEST NOVEL HNC TREATMENT STRATEGIES, 4) IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IMMUNE MODULATION CAN AUGMENT CONVENTIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT RESPONSES IN HNC, 5) TRANSLATE PROMISING NEW MOLECULES DEVELOPED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN AND FROM INDUSTRY THROUGH PRECLINICAL TESTING AND INTO HNC CLINICAL TRIALS. THE WISCONSIN HN SPORE HAS DESIGNED THREE PRIMARY RESEARCH PROJECTS. PROJECT 1 WILL COMBINE TARGETED RADIONUCLIDE THERAPIES (TRT) WITH IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITION (ICI) TO STIMULATE ENHANCED HNC RESPONSE PROFILES CULMINATING IN A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL. PROJECT 2 BUILDS A POWERFUL PATIENT-SPECIFIC BIOENGINEERED HNC MODEL SYSTEM FROM PATIENT CELLS THAT INCORPORATES COMPONENTS OF THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT TO MORE ACCURATELY PREDICT HNC PATIENT TREATMENT RESPONSE. THE FEASIBILITY OF USING TREATMENT RESPONSE DATA FROM THE MODEL TO INFORM POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY WILL BE TESTED IN A CLINICAL PILOT STUDY. PROJECT 3 EXAMINES DUAL TARGETING OF CRITICAL RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES AXL AND MERTK TO MEDIATE CHANGES IN THE IMMUNE MICROENVIRONMENT AND THEREBY AUGMENT TUMOR RESPONSE IN HNC PATIENTS. THE WISCONSIN SPORE WILL SUPPORT THIS RESEARCH WITH THREE CORES (ADMINISTRATIVE, PATHOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS), A CAREER ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM AND A DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "WI", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f044e52c-101e-349e-69e4-aaa93e72f7ab-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_P50CA278595_7529"}, {"internal_id": 139742245, "Award ID": "P50CA261605", "Award Amount": 3790672.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-08-30", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "COLORADO HEAD AND NECK CANCER SPORE - PROJECT SUMMARY, OVERALL THE MAIN GOAL OF THE COLORADO (CO) HEAD AND NECK CANCER (HNC) SPORE IS TO ADVANCE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH TO IMPROVE SURVIVAL AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR HNC PATIENTS.

IT WILL TEST IF BLOCKADE OF EPHB4-EFNB2 SIGNALING AT THE TUMOR ENDOTHELIAL BARRIER HINDERS TREGS' AND TAMS' ABILITY TO INFILTRATE AND PROMOTE CANCER SURVIVAL OR SUPPRESS TEFF FUNCTION. THE APPLICABILITY OF PRE-CLINICAL DATA TO CLINIC WILL BE ASSESSED IN SAMPLES FROM HNSCC PATIENTS TREATED WITH AN EPHB4- EFNB2 INHIBITOR DURING A WINDOW TRIAL. PROJECT 2 INVESTIGATES IF DUAL INHIBITION OF TGFSS/PD-L1 COMBINED WITH RADIATION THERAPY (RT) INDUCES IN SITU VACCINATION, REVERSES IMMUNE SUPPRESSION, AND OVERCOMES RT RESISTANCE. IT WILL TRANSLATE ITS FINDINGS WITH A TRIAL OF THE TGFSS/PD-L1 DUAL INHIBITOR M7824 COMBINED WITH RT IN LOCALLY RECURRENT AND OLIGOMETASTATIC HNSCC PATIENTS. PROJECT 3 WILL STUDY MECHANISMS OF PROTEIN ELONGATION INHIBITION IN HNSCC, IDENTIFYING KEY PROTEINS TARGETED BY THE NOVEL INHIBITOR SVC112 (A DRUG DISCOVERED IN COLORADO THAT IS NEARING CLINICAL TESTING), AND TRANSLATING OUR FINDINGS BY TESTING THE DISTRIBUTION AND PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF ITS TARGET (EEF2) IN PATIENT SAMPLES. IT WILL USE IMMUNE RELEVANT MODELS INCLUDING SYNGENEIC AND HUMANIZED MICE TO STUDY IMMUNE-DEPENDENT AND \u2013INDEPENDENT MECHANISMS OF SVC112 AND STUDY IF PROTEIN ELONGATION INHIBITION IMPACTS THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT AND ENHANCES RT IN HNSCC. THE DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM (DRP) IS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT CURRENT HNC RESEARCHERS AND RESEARCHERS FROM OTHER FIELDS TO CONDUCT INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN ALL TYPES OF CANCERS ARISING FROM HEAD AND NECK TISSUES. THE CAREER ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (CEP) IS DESIGNED TO SOLICIT JUNIOR RESEARCHERS TO DEVELOP RESEARCH PROJECTS TO TRANSITION INTO INDEPENDENT HNC RESEARCHERS. WE ENCOURAGE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY (URM) AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO APPLY FOR DRP AND CEP PROJECTS. THE CO HNC SPORE ALSO INCLUDES BIOSPECIMEN/PATHOLOGY, DATA SCIENCE, AND ADMINISTRATIVE CORES. IN SUM, THE CO HNC SPORE WILL SOLIDIFY IN-DEPTH HNC TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AND EXPAND OUR TEAM OF DEDICATED HNC RESEARCHERS. THESE ACTIVITIES WILL IMPROVE THE CARE SPANNING THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF HNC TREATMENT FROM IMPROVING CURES TO DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PALLIATION STRATEGIES FOR HNC PATIENTS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CO", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "7f8eb9f7-3ee7-fb7d-c649-ee912e019c18-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_P50CA261605_7529"}, {"internal_id": 49666050, "Award ID": "P50CA097190", "Award Amount": 29098958.48, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2007-08-10", "CFDA Number": "93.397", "Description": "SPORE IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "PA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6ad8c5c3-8085-49bb-9227-fc5bc4a1f938-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_P50CA097190_7529"}, {"internal_id": 131832851, "Award ID": "P30AI161943", "Award Amount": 5464743.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-04-23", "CFDA Number": "93.855", "Description": "TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH - PROJECT SUMMARY \u2013 TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH IN 2019, THE US ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO END THE HIV EPIDEMIC BY 2030. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, STRATEGIES THAT IMPROVE HIV PREVENTION AND HIV TREATMENT OUTCOMES ARE NEEDED. ONLY 56% OF PEOPLE WITH HIV (PWH) WERE VIRALLY SUPPRESSED IN 2018, A CRITICAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH OUTCOMES AND TRANSMISSION RISK, AND 51% OF HIV DIAGNOSES IN 2018 WERE IN THE US SOUTH, DESPITE CONSTITUTING ONLY 38% OF THE POPULATION IN THE US. TEXAS IS THE SECOND MOST POPULOUS STATE IN THE US, BEHIND CALIFORNIA, WITH ABOUT 29 MILLION RESIDENTS, AND IS IN THE US SOUTH AS DEFINED BY CDC AND THE CENSUS BUREAU. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS LARGE TEXAS POPULATION, COUPLED WITH WEAKER PUBLIC HEALTH AND PREVENTION POLICIES AND FUNDING ACROSS THE US SOUTH, HAS A GROWING HIV POPULATION THAT LAGS IN CRITICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH AND RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE TO COMBAT THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE US SOUTH AND SPECIFICALLY IN TEXAS TO BOTH CONTRIBUTE TO ENDING THE US HIV EPIDEMIC AND TO LEARN HOW TO BEST DO THAT IN RESOURCE CONSTRAINED AREAS OF THE US. WE THEREFORE WILL ESTABLISH A TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH (D-CFAR) TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL MISSION OF THE NATIONAL CFAR PROGRAM BY FACILITATING HIGH-PRIORITY HIV RESEARCH AND SUPPORTING THE EFFORT TO END THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN THE US. THREE INSTITUTIONS HAVE COLLABORATED TO PROPOSE THIS D-CFAR: BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN HOUSTON, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER AT HOUSTON AND THE TEXAS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN SAN ANTONIO. BASED UPON THE OUTSTANDING EXPERTISE OF ITS INVESTIGATORS, THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL FOCUS ITS ACTIVITIES IN THE FIVE-YEAR FUNDING PERIOD ON THE RESEARCH THEME \u201cENDING HIV AND OPTIMIZING HIV HEALTH IN TEXAS.\u201d TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GOALS, THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL: 1) PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND FACILITATE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS THAT STRENGTHEN AND ENRICH THE D-CFAR RESEARCH AND INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT; 2) SUPPORT TARGETED HIGH-PRIORITY INTERDISCIPLINARY PILOT RESEARCH PROJECTS, ASSIST IN RESPONDING TO NEW HIV-RELATED RESEARCH INITIATIVES, AND FACILITATE RESEARCH ON ENDING HIV AND IMPROVING HEALTH OF PWH IN TEXAS; AND 3) PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART EXPERTISE, ADVICE, AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE THE RANGE OF HIV-RELATED RESEARCH FOR D-CFAR INVESTIGATORS. THE TEXAS D-CFAR WILL SUPPORT AN ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, A DEVELOPMENTAL CORE, A BASIC SCIENCE CORE AND A CLINICAL AND BIOSTATISTICS CORE TO MEET INVESTIGATOR NEEDS AND CATALYZE INNOVATIVE RESEARCH. THE SCIENTIFIC CORES WILL BUILD ON OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS IN VIROLOGY, NON-HUMAN PRIMATE RESOURCES, CLINICAL TRIALS RESEARCH AND BIOSTATISTICS. THE D-CFAR WILL ENGAGE A COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ADVISORY BOARDS FOR GUIDANCE. COUPLED WITH OUTSTANDING INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, THE D- CFAR WILL STIMULATE NEW RESEARCH AND COLLABORATIONS AMONG BASIC, TRANSLATIONAL, CLINICAL, HEALTH SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS. THE D-CFAR WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO END HIV AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF PWH IN TEXAS AND SIMILAR AREAS, TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS, AND GROW INTO A FULL CFAR, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO ENDING THE HIV EPIDEMIC IN TEXAS, THE US SOUTH, AND BEYOND.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "ddcd398f-5e59-e840-2368-a57b84efdc7d-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_P30AI161943_7529"}, {"internal_id": 147873522, "Award ID": "P30AI152501", "Award Amount": 6215137.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-08", "CFDA Number": "93.855", "Description": "UCLA-CDU CFAR - OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: THIS APPLICATION IS A RESUBMISSION FOR A NEW CFAR THAT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN UCLA AND CDU.

"MAPPING AND PREDICTION OF QUANTITATIVE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR DOSAGE EFFECTS TO UNDERSTAND VARIATION IN CRANIOFACIAL MORPHOLOGY AND DISEASE - PROJECT SUMMARY ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS ROBUSTNESS OF TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION, YET HUMAN GENETIC STUDIES INDICATE PHENOTYPIC SENSITIVITY TO TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (TF) DOSAGE IN BOTH COMPLEX TRAITS AND RARE DISORDERS, MOTIVATING QUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF TF DOSAGE EFFECTS. THESE FEATURES ARE EXEMPLIFIED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN FACE, WHICH IS FREQUENTLY DISRUPTED IN A RANGE OF SYNDROMES WITH TYPICAL FEATURES. THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AND APPLY TOOLS TO PRECISELY MODULATE DOSAGE OF CRANIOFACIAL TFS IN CRANIAL NEURAL CREST CELLS, THE PROGENITORS OF THE FACE, AND ASSESS EFFECTS ACROSS MULTIPLE BIOLOGICAL LEVELS \u2013 MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, AND MORPHOLOGICAL. THE PROPOSAL INITIALLY FOCUSES ON SOX9, USING DIVERSE APPROACHES TO UNDERSTAND THE RULES THAT DETERMINE WHICH REGULATORY ELEMENTS AND GENES ARE SENSITIVE TO SOX9 DOSAGE (AIM 1), AS WELL AS THEIR PHENOTYPIC CONSEQUENCES (AIM 2). THEN, SUCH RULES WILL BE GENERALIZED TO FIVE ADDITIONAL CRANIOFACIAL TFS (AIM 3) AND USED TO DISSECT MECHANISMS UNDERLYING GENETIC VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH CRANIOFACIAL MORPHOLOGY OR DISEASE (AIM 4). THESE STUDIES WILL REVEAL DRIVERS OF CRANIOFACIAL MORPHOLOGICAL AND DISEASE VARIATION, PROVIDE GENERAL INSIGHTS INTO TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION, AND HELP TRANSFORM OUR APPROACH TO STUDYING TF FUNCTION, FROM BINARY TO QUANTITATIVE IN NATURE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, ALONG WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR MY CAREER DEVELOPMENT, COMBINES MY SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND AND POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING IN FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS, GENE REGULATION, AND HUMAN GENETICS WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING IN MACHINE LEARNING, MOUSE GENETICS, AND MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. I WILL BE MENTORED BY DRS. JOANNA WYSOCKA AND JONATHAN PRITCHARD IN A VIBRANT SCIENTIFIC ENVIRONMENT (STANFORD CHEMICAL AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY) AND RECEIVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING FROM MY ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF DRS. JAMES FERRELL, ANSHUL KUNDAJE, AND BENEDIKT HALLGRIMSSON.

UNCOVERING THE HOMEOSTATIC AND PATHOGENIC POTENTIAL OF LONG-TERM IMMUNE CELLS IN PERIODONTAL TISSUES IS CRUCIAL TO REVEALING THE CELLULAR DRIVERS OF PD RECURRENCE. THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON AN OVERLOOKED PERIODONTAL-ASSOCIATED CELLULAR COMPARTMENT, CD4+ T MEMORY CELLS (TM), WHICH CAN READILY RECOGNIZE MICROBIAL ANTIGENS FOR A QUICK AND ROBUST RESPONSE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE WILL UTILIZE A NEWLY CHARACTERIZED MURINE MODEL OF RECURRENT PD AND A METHOD FOR GINGIVAL T-CELL ENRICHMENT. IN THIS MODEL, TIME IS A CRITICAL VARIABLE FOR RECOGNIZING DISEASE INITIATION, RESOLUTION, AND RECURRENCE. BY ESTABLISHING THIS MODEL, WE WILL BE ABLE TO DEFINE A \u201cRECOVERED\u201d BASELINE INSTEAD OF A \u201cHEALTHY\u201d BASELINE STATE, WHICH IS MORE CLINICALLY ACCURATE. ALSO, IT ALLOWS DEFINING HOW MULTIPLE RELAPSE EPISODES INCREMENTALLY IMPACT THE COMPLEX PERIODONTALLY-ASSOCIATED IMMUNE NETWORK. THE PRELIMINARY STUDIES REVEALED THAT CD4+ TM DEVELOPED IN THE GINGIVA SOON AFTER BIRTH DUE TO INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL ANTIGENIC EXPOSURE. WHILE THE MICE FULLY RECOVERED FROM LIGATURE-INDUCED PD, THE BONE LOSS RATE ACCELERATED DURING PD RECURRENCE. MOST INTRIGUINGLY, CD4+ TM SUBTYPES ARE ENRICHED IN THE GINGIVA DURING PD RECURRENCE. GINGIVAL CD4+ TISSUE-RESIDENT MEMORY CELLS INDUCED BONE LOSS WHEN CIRCULATING T CELL INFILTRATION WAS INHIBITED. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE PD-INDUCED GENERATION AND PERSISTENCE OF CD4+ TM SUBTYPES DETERMINE PD RECURRENCE. THUS, TARGETED DEPLETION OF THESE CELLS BY INHIBITING METABOLIC CHECKPOINTS WILL ENHANCE IMMUNE-REGULATORY RESPONSES AND INHIBIT PD RECURRENCE.

HERE, THE FOCUS WILL BE ON UNDERSTANDING THE CONSTITUTIVE AND PATHOLOGIC GENERATION OF CD4+ TM CELLS TO DETERMINE THEIR ROLES IN THE GINGIVAL IMMUNE LANDSCAPE. 2) TO ELUCIDATE PD-INDUCED CD4+ TM PATHOGENICITY. HERE, WE WILL EVALUATE WHICH CD4+ TM SUBTYPES RETAIN PRO-INFLAMMATORY AND OSTEOCLASTOGENIC PROGRAMMING AFTER PD. WE WILL MAKE TRANSCRIPTOMIC COMPARISONS BETWEEN CD4+ TM SUBTYPES AND ASSESS THE FINDINGS WITH EX VIVO FUNCTIONAL ASSAYS TO VALIDATE THEIR PATHOGENIC POTENTIAL. 3) TO DEVELOP AN INTERVENTION STRATEGY FOR CD4+ TM DEPLETION TO PREVENT PD RECURRENCE. HERE, WE WILL EMPLOY A METABOLIC-BASED STRATEGY TO SELECTIVELY DEPLETE PD-INDUCED CD4+ TM AND ENHANCE REGULATORY T CELLS ENRICHMENT TO PREVENT PD RECURRENCE.

HOWEVER, THE BENEFIT REMAINS LIMITED TO PATIENTS WITH A HIGH RISK OF COMPLICATIONS, AND THE BURDEN OF TOXICITY IN SURVIVING PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCERS IS SEVERE. HYPERTHERMIA COMBINED WITH OTHER TREATMENTS, SUCH AS RADIATION, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND IMMUNOTHERAPY, HAS BEEN SHOWN IN CLINICAL TRIALS TO INCREASE RESPONSE FOR HEAD AND NECK CANCERS, BUT SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE DELIVERED THERMAL DOSE DISTRIBUTIONS. HENCE, THIS TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES SPATIALLY CONTROLLABLE HEAT DELIVERY AND ADEQUATE TEMPERATURE MONITORING. MR-GUIDED FOCUSED ULTRASOUND (MRGFUS) CAN POTENTIALLY BE USED TO DELIVER HYPERTHERMIA. THE FOCUSED ULTRASOUND TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN RECEIVED MUCH INTEREST DUE TO ITS COMPLETELY NON-INVASIVE HEAT DELIVERY WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF SPATIAL SELECTIVITY AND DYNAMIC CONTROL.

WHILE MC STIMULATION (MCS) HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE CHRONIC PAIN IN HUMAN SUBJECTS AND TO DECREASE NOCIFENSIVE BEHAVIORS IN RODENT PAIN MODELS, MAJOR QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT THE MCS ANALGESIC MECHANISMS OF ACTION, HOW MC INFLUENCES ACTIVITY IN NOCICEPTIVE CIRCUITS, AND HOW TO IMPROVE MCS CLINICAL EFFICACY. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MCS ANTINOCICEPTIVE EFFICACY INCREASES WHEN THE STIMULATION TARGETS THE REGION IN MOTOR CORTEX THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE BODY PART FROM WHICH NOCICEPTION ORIGINATES (SOMATOTOPICALLY MATCHED) AND THAT MCS ANALGESIA REQUIRES ENDOGENOUS OPIOID ACTIVITY.

FURTHERMORE, I WILL TEST THE MECHANISM OF MED23-MEDIATED CONTROL OF KEY REGULATORY GENES THAT FUNCTION IN CRANIOFACIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ARE LINKED TO CRANIOFACIAL DISORDERS. SPECIFICALLY, I WILL INVESTIGATE THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF MED23 FUNCTION VIA ITS CONTROL OF RUNX2 AND SS-CATENIN IN THE MANDIBULAR MESENCHYME.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TELEHEALTH INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC MASTICATORY MUSCLE PAIN - CHRONIC MASTICATORY MUSCLE PAIN DISORDERS (MMPD) AFFECT BETWEEN 5-12% OF THE POPULATION, ARE THE SECOND MOST COMMON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN CONDITIONS AFTER CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGEMENT COSTS OF OVER $4 BILLION PER YEAR, PRESENTING A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE COMBINING DENTAL CARE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS APPEARS TO OFFER THE BEST PROGNOSIS. PHYSICAL SELF- REGULATION (PSR) IS A BRIEF, TWO-SESSION PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTION THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO LONG-TERM REDUCTIONS IN PAIN INTENSITY OVER STANDARD DENTAL CARE ALONE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC MMPD. UNFORTUNATELY, TREATMENT UTILIZATION FOR PSR IS LOW WHEN IT IS OFFERED IN-PERSON, WITH FEWER THAN 50% OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS CHOOSING TO BEGIN TREATMENT. OFFERING PSR OVER TELEHEALTH (PSR-TH) MAY HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WITH PRELIMINARY DATA DEMONSTRATING >80% TREATMENT UTILIZATION FOR PSR-TH. A FULL-SCALE TRIAL IS NEEDED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF PSR-TH AND 1) DETERMINE IF PSR-TH EFFECTS ARE DUE TO THE INTERVENTION ITSELF OR TO NONSPECIFIC TREATMENT EFFECTS AND 2) DETERMINE MODERATORS AND MEDIATORS OF TREATMENT EFFECTS. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL DATA ARE NEEDED BEFORE SUCH A TRIAL CAN BE CONDUCTED. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO OBTAIN DATA TO SUPPORT A FUTURE FULL-SCALE PHASE II EFFICACY TRIAL BY ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS. FIRST, PSR-TH AND A CONTROL INTERVENTION NEED TO BE FORMALLY PILOTED IN PATIENTS WITH MMPD TO DETERMINE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RATES, INTERVENTIONIST FIDELITY, AND PATIENT-REPORTED ACCEPTABILITY, CREDIBILITY, AND BURDEN OF THE INTERVENTIONS (AIM 1). SECOND, WE NEED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL MODERATORS AND MEDIATORS OF PSR-TH SO THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON THOROUGHLY ASSESSING THOSE SPECIFIC VARIABLES IN THE FUTURE TRIAL (AIM 2). TREATMENT-SEEKING FEMALES WITH CHRONIC MMPD WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO 50-MIN TELEHEALTH SESSIONS OF PSR-TH OR A CONTROL INTERVENTION (N=52/GROUP) AND WILL PROVIDE BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODERATOR DATA (WEEK 0), TREATMENT FEASIBILITY DATA IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION (WEEK 3), MEDIATION DATA TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION (WEEK 5), AND OUTCOME DATA (PAIN INTENSITY, PAIN INTERFERENCE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE) TWO WEEKS AND THREE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION (WEEKS 5 AND 15). WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BOTH PSR-TH AND THE CONTROL INTERVENTION WILL DEMONSTRATE STRONG FEASIBILITY (I.E., RECRUITMENT OF AT LEAST 1 PARTICIPANT PER WEEK, >75% RETENTION, >95% INTERVENTIONIST FIDELITY, AND ADEQUATE ACCEPTABILITY, CREDIBILITY, AND BURDEN). WE ALSO HYPOTHESIZE THAT SPECIFIC BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES WILL MODERATE PSR-RELATED CHANGES IN OUTCOMES, AND THAT PSR-TH-RELATED CHANGES IN PERCEIVED CONTROL OVER PAIN, SELF-EFFICACY, COPING, PARAFUNCTIONAL HABITS, AND RELAXATION WILL MEDIATE TREATMENT EFFECTS. IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING A FUTURE EFFICACY TRIAL OF PSR-TH, THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE MY PREVIOUS TRAINING, A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, AND THE EXPERTISE OF WORLD-RENOWN MENTORS TO PROVIDE ME TRAINING IN CLINICAL RESEARCH, ASSESSMENT OF MODERATORS AND MEDIATORS IN OROFACIAL PAIN, AND LEADERSHIP OF RESEARCH TEAMS, GIVING ME THE SKILLS FOR A SUCCESSFUL INDEPENDENT CLINICAL RESEARCH CAREER.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "KY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "c477975b-68db-c3dc-4a79-b95cb9f6ab3e-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_K23DE031807_7529"}, {"internal_id": 138341370, "Award ID": "K23DE031021", "Award Amount": 382857.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-07-13", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "IMPACT OF ANTICHOLINERGIC MEDICATION ON SALIVARY FUNCTION; EXPLORING POTENTIAL GENETIC MARKERS FOR DRY MOUTH - THE GROWING MEDICATION USE IN ALL AGES LED TO THE FACT THAT 20% OF THE US ADULT POPULATION TAKE FIVE OR MORE DRUGS (POLYPHARMACY). OVER 500 MEDICATIONS COMMONLY PRESCRIBED IN POLYPHARMACY (E.G., ANTIDEPRESSANTS, URINARY ANTISPASMODICS, AND PSYCHOLEPTICS) POSSESS ANTICHOLINERGIC (AC) PROPERTIES BLOCKING THE MUSCARINIC SIGNALING OF NEURAL REGULATION. DUE TO THE SCATTERED DISTRIBUTION OF MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS IN THE BODY, AC MEDICATIONS HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF SIDE EFFECTS. BESIDES THE MOST SEVERE CENTRAL TOXICITY OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, DYSKINESIA, AND PSYCHOSIS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO DELIRIUM, THE MOST FREQUENT PERIPHERAL SIDE EFFECT IS DRY MOUTH. DRY MOUTH IS CHARACTERIZED BY REDUCED SALIVA SECRETION (HYPOSALIVATION), IMPAIRED QUALITY OF LIFE BY CAUSING CHEWING OR SWALLOWING PROBLEMS, COMPLAINTS OF ORAL DRYNESS (XEROSTOMIA), SPEAKING DIFFICULTIES, MUCOSAL CHANGES, INCREASED RATE OF DENTAL CARIES, AND TOOTH LOSS. DRY MOUTH CAUSES INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO BACTERIAL COLONIZATION AND INFECTIONS IN THE ORAL CAVITY AND THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT. HOWEVER, NO DATA ARE AVAILABLE ON PREDICTING MEDICATION-INDUCED DRY MOUTH SEVERITY OR DETERMINING THE AC BURDEN FROM THESE MEDICATIONS AMONG DENTAL PATIENTS. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH GAP IN IDENTIFYING HIGH-RISK XEROSTOMIA PATIENTS IN THE MIDDLE-AGED POPULATION BEFORE REACHING OLDER AGES WHEN DAMAGE TO ORAL HEALTH IS IRREVERSIBLE. WE DESIGNED A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WITH TWO AIMS FOR ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS. IN AIM 1., WE WILL EVALUATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN AC BURDEN AND DRY MOUTH OUTCOMES, INCLUDING THE FLOW RATES OF THE MINOR SALIVARY GLANDS (SG) IN 90 MIDDLE- AGED PATIENTS (45-64 YEARS). WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER HIGH AC BURDEN, QUANTIFIED BY THE AC DRUG SCORE (ADS) AND SERUM AC ACTIVITY (SAA) IN BLOOD, IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE SEVERE DRY MOUTH SYMPTOMS, MEASURED AT BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UPS FOR TWO YEARS. WE WILL ASSESS DRY MOUTH USING SALIVA FLOW RATES (UNSTIMULATED WHOLE SALIVA AND MINOR SGS) AND ORAL HEALTH MEASURES ASSOCIATED WITH DRY MOUTH, INCLUDING XEROSTOMIA, DENTAL CARIES, AND ORAL HEALTH IMPACT PROFILE. IN THIS AIM, WE WILL EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF MINOR SG FLOW SCREENING AS A POINT- OF-CARE TEST FOR DRY MOUTH. IN AIM 2., WE WILL EXPLORE WHETHER CYP450 GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS PREDICT DRY MOUTH SEVERITY. RECENT STUDIES REPORTED AN INCREASED PREVALENCE OF AC SIDE EFFECTS IN PATIENTS WITH INACTIVE GENETIC VARIANTS OF LIVER CYTOCHROME P450 ENZYMES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE METABOLIC CLEARANCE OF AC DRUGS. WE WILL ANALYZE DNA FROM PATIENTS\u2019 BLOOD FOR THE GENETIC VARIATIONS OF CYP2D6 AND CYP2C19 ENZYMES AND COMPARE ORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH DRY MOUTH BETWEEN POOR AND NORMO-METABOLIZING PHENOTYPES.

THE OUTLINED PROPOSAL BUILDS ON THE CANDIDATE\u2019S PREVIOUS BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH SKILLS BY INTEGRATING PATIENT-ORIENTED TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH. UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF DR. BRIAN SCHMIDT AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, THE CANDIDATE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH A RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT DEFINED THE CLINICAL PHENOTYPE OF A PAINFUL OROFACIAL CONDITION, AND DEVELOPED A PARADIGM THAT ALLOWS INVESTIGATORS TO TEST NOCICEPTIVE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PHENOTYPIC FEATURES OF THE PAINFUL CONDITION. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN WILL POSITION THE CANDIDATE WITH A UNIQUE SET OF CROSS DISCIPLINARY SKILLS THAT WILL ENABLE HER TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE AS A TRANSLATIONAL SCIENTIST FOCUSED ON THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF OROFACIAL PAIN IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. THE INCIDENCE OF ORAL CANCER IS RAPIDLY INCREASING IN THE UNITED STATES. MORE PATIENTS ARE AFFLICTED WITH ORAL CANCER THAN MELANOMA, CERVICAL CANCER, OR OVARIAN CANCER. OROFACIAL PAIN IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON INITIAL SYMPTOMS OF ORAL CANCER AND OFTEN LEADS TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF ORAL CANCER. HOWEVER, THE CHARACTER, SEVERITY, AND UNIQUE FEATURES OF ORAL CANCER PAIN WIDELY DIFFER BETWEEN PATIENTS. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EFFECTIVE AND LASTING TREATMENT AVAILABLE TO ALLEVIATE SUFFERING FROM ORAL CANCER PAIN. CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL DATA SUGGEST THAT CANCER CAUSES PAIN THROUGH THE SECRETION OF MEDIATORS THAT ACTIVATE AND SENSITIZE NOCICEPTORS; HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF NOCICEPTIVE MEDIATORS AND THEIR MECHANISMS OF ACTION (I.E., RESPONSIBLE RECEPTORS) ARE UNKNOWN. THE FOUNDATION FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON PRELIMINARY STUDIES DEMONSTRATING THAT ORAL CANCER PATIENTS EXPERIENCE PREOPERATIVE SENSITIVITY TO CAPSAICIN (I.E., CHEMOSENSITIVITY) AND REPORT GREATER FUNCTIONAL (I.E., MECHANOSENSITIVITY) PAIN. THE OUTLINED EXPERIMENTS WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE QUALITY OF PAIN EXPERIENCED BY ORAL CANCER PATIENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE LEVEL OF ACTIVATION OF SPECIFIC CHANNELS ON NOCICEPTORS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO 1) DEVELOP AND VALIDATE ASSAYS TO QUANTIFY MECHANO- AND CHEMOSENSITIVITY IN ORAL CANCER PATIENTS, AND COMPARE THE SENSITIVITIES TO HEALTHY SUBJECTS, AND 2) DETERMINE THE RECEPTOR SUBTYPES RESPONSIBLE FOR NOCICEPTIVE BEHAVIOR IN AN ORAL CANCER MOUSE MODEL. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM THE PROPOSED RESEARCH HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL, NON-OPIOID TREATMENT STRATEGIES THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE UNIQUE PAIN EXPERIENCED BY INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS.

HOW THE COMPOSITION AND SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE TUMOR IMMUNE MICROENVIRONMENT RELATES TO ICI EFFICACY IN HNSCC IS CURRENTLY POORLY UNDERSTOOD.

KIM'S LONG-TERM GOAL TO EVENTUALLY EMERGE AS AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER STUDYING THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM OF BACTERIAL AND HOST IMMUNE RESPONSE IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP ADJUNCTIVE/ALTERNATIVE THERAPEUTICS FOR PERIODONTITIS.  AMONG MANY POSSIBLE BACTERIA THAT CAN CAUSE PERIODONTITIS, AA WAS KNOWN AS THE ETIOLOGY FOR LAP. OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AA IS A CRITICAL PATHOGEN PROVIDING A SUITABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR OTHER PATHOGENS AND CAUSE LAP. AMONG DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOXINS PRODUCED BY AA, DR. KIM'S PROJECT FOCUS ON CDT PRODUCED BY AA WHICH CAUSES CELL CYCLE ARREST, APOPTOSIS IN T CELLS AND UPREGULATES PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES IN MACROPHAGES BY PHOSPHOINOSITIDE 3-KINASES BLOCKADE. CDT ACTS AS A PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3,4,5-TRIPHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE AND CAUSES PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL (PI) POOL IMBALANCE WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR NOT ONLY THE CELLULAR RESPONSE BUT PHAGOSOME DEGRADATION. DR. KIM'S OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AA CDT-MEDIATED DISRUPTION IN MACROPHAGE PHAGOSOME PROCESSING LEADS TO AA SURVIVAL CONTRIBUTING TO DISRUPTION OF LOCAL HOST DEFENSE. IN AIM1, DR. KIM WILL INVESTIGATE PHAGOSOME MATURATION WITH EFFECTOR PROTEINS AND PHAGO-LYSOSOME FUSION REGARDING CDT-MEDIATED PI POOL IMBALANCE IN MACROPHAGE. IN AIM 2, DR. KIM WILL STUDY EFFECT OF CDT ON MACROPHAGE AND SURVIVABILITY OF AA BY USING WILD TYPE AND CDT DEFICIENT MUTANT AA. FURTHERMORE, DR. KIM WILL INVESTIGATE THE PRO-INFLAMMATORY AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN RELATION TO SURVIVABILITY OF AA. FOR AIM 3, DR.

HNSCC IS A DEBILITATING DISEASE WITH SIGNIFICANT PATIENT-RELATED MORBIDITY RELATED TO THE DISEASE ITSELF AND ITS MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS COMPLEX AND CONSISTS OF A COMBINATION OF SURGERY, RADIATION, AND CHEMOTHERAPY. A KEY FACTOR IN DETERMINING PROPER HNSCC MANAGEMENT IS THE PRESENCE OF ENE, WHICH OCCURS WHEN TUMOR INFILTRATES THROUGH THE CAPSULE OF AN INVOLVED LYMPH NODE INTO THE SURROUNDING TISSUE. ENE IS BOTH AN IMPORTANT PROGNOSTIC FACTOR AND AN INDICATION FOR ADJUVANT TREATMENT ESCALATION WITH THE ADDITION OF CHEMOTHERAPY TO RADIATION FOLLOWING SURGERY. THIS \u201cTRIMODALITY THERAPY\u201d IS PROBLEMATIC, AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED TREATMENT-RELATED MORBIDITY AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, BUT NO IMPROVEMENT IN DISEASE CONTROL COMPARED TO UPFRONT CHEMORADIATION ALONE. THE CHALLENGE IS THAT ENE CAN ONLY BE DEFINITIVELY DIAGNOSED PATHOLOGICALLY AFTER SURGERY, AND PRETREATMENT RADIOGRAPHIC ENE IDENTIFICATION HAS PROVEN UNRELIABLE FOR EVEN EXPERT DIAGNOSTICIANS, LEADING TO HIGH RATES OF TRIMODALITY THERAPY AND SUBOPTIMAL TREATMENT OUTCOMES. IN HNSCC MANAGEMENT THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR IMPROVED PRETREATMENT ENE IDENTIFICATION TO 1) SELECT APPROPRIATE PATIENTS FOR SURGERY TO AVOID THE EXCESS MORBIDITY AND COSTS OF TRIMODALITY THERAPY, 2) RISK-STRATIFY PATIENTS OPTIMALLY, AND 3) SELECT APPROPRIATE PATIENTS FOR TREATMENT DE-ESCALATION OR INTENSIFICATION CLINICAL TRIALS.

CURRENT OI MANAGEMENT RELIES MAINLY UPON LONG-TERM ANTI-RESORPTIVE TREATMENTS THAT PREVENT FRACTURES, YET MAY INTERFERE WITH NORMAL JAW BONE HEALING. A NOVEL STRATEGY FOR OI TREATMENT IS SCLEROSTIN ANTIBODY (SCLAB), WHICH INDUCES A STRONG ANABOLIC RESPONSE TO INCREASE BONE DENSITY. ALTHOUGH SCLAB INCREASES BONE FORMATION AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE BIOMECHANICAL LONG BONE PROPERTIES, LONG-TERM CONTINUOUS DOSING RAPIDLY DECREASES BONE-FORMATION RESPONSE BY INCREASING WNT ANTAGONIST EXPRESSION. CYCLING SCLAB TREATMENTS WITH ANTIBODY-FREE PERIODS RESTORES BONE-FORMATION RESPONSE BASED ON LONG BONE RESEARCH, SO LITTLE IS KNOWN HOW THIS STRATEGY AFFECTS JAW BONE AND IMPLANT OSSEOINTEGRATION (BONE HEALING). SUCCESSFUL IMPLANT STABILITY (PRIMARY HEALING) AND OSSEOINTEGRATION (LONG-TERM HEALING) DEPENDS ON GOOD BONE DENSITY. THEREFORE, TO PREDICT JAW BONE DENSITY IN OI BEFORE AND AFTER IMPLANT PLACEMENT, THERE IS A CLINICAL NEED TO BIOMARK SCLAB-INDUCED ANABOLIC EFFECTS. THE USE OF MICRORNAS (MIRNAS) AS BIOMARKERS FOR OI IS ATTRACTIVE. FOUND TO PLAY KEY ROLES IN THE REGULATION OF BONE HOMEOSTASIS-RELATED PATHWAYS, BONE-REMODELING-RELATED MIRNAS MAY POSSIBLY REPLACE THE CURRENT NONSPECIFIC BONE DENSITY DIAGNOSIS TOOLS, RESULTING IN A PERSONALIZED MEDICINE APPROACH FOR OI TREATMENT MANAGEMENT. THERE ARE 2 AIMS IN THIS STUDY. AIM 1: ELUCIDATE THE OPTIMAL SCLAB-CYCLE THERAPY REGIMEN THAT INDUCES AND SUSTAINS THE JAWBONE FORMATION RESPONSE AND ITS EFFECT ON OSSEOINTEGRATION. AIM 2: TO DETERMINE THE BONE-REMODELING-RELATED MIRNA PANELS THAT DETECT OR PREDICT SCLAB TREATMENT OUTCOME TO GUIDE IMPLANT PLACEMENT DECISIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE BOTH THE SCLAB THERAPY SCHEDULE THAT INDUCES AND SUSTAINS THE OPTIMAL BONE ANABOLIC EFFECTS WITHOUT AFFECTING THE HEALING AND MIRNA PANELS OF ANABOLIC AND RESORPTIVE PHASE THAT CAN BE USED TO CORRELATE THE SCLAB EFFECTS ON BONE METABOLISM FOR DENTAL AND ORTHOPEDIC TREATMENT DECISIONS AND LONG-TERM DISEASE MONITORING OF LOW BONE MASS PATIENTS.

CRITICAL FAILURES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT GRAFTING TREATMENTS, LIKE OSTEONECROSIS, OCCUR DUE TO POOR LOCAL CONDITIONS AND LIMITED INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE GRAFT AND THE HOST TISSUE. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT CARTILAGE GRAFTS PRODUCE WELL-VASCULARIZED AND INTEGRATED BONE REGENERATION SIMILAR TO AN ISOGRAFT, INDICATING THAT CHONDROCYTES CAN FORM BONES. AS A MECHANISM, CELL TRANS-DIFFERENTIATION FROM CHONDROCYTES INTO BONE CELLS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED. YET, MEMBRANOUS OSTEOGENESIS IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERED THE SOLE MECHANISM IN THE FORMATION AND REPAIR OF MANDIBLE BODY, DESPITE TWO TYPES OF CARTILAGE (MECKEL\u2019S CARTILAGE, MC; AND ROSTRAL PROCESS, RP) PRESENT DURING MANDIBLE GROWTH. SIMILAR TO THE MOUSE MODEL, A RP-MC-LIKE STRUCTURE IS IDENTIFIED IN HUMAN FETUSES AND INFANTS. TO ADDRESS WHETHER ENDOCHONDROGENESIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROWTH AND REPAIR OF MANDIBLE BODY, A SERIES OF STUDIES USING COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES HAS BEEN PERFORMED. THE KEY FINDINGS ARE: 1) THE MANDIBLE BODY IS COMPOSED OF BOTH MEMBRANOUS AND ENDOCHONDRAL BONES; 2) HYPERTROPHIC CHONDROCYTES IN MC AND RP DIRECTLY TRANS- DIFFERENTIATE TO BONE CELLS INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY ENTERING APOPTOSIS; 3) RP-MC IS ONE CONTINUOUS CARTILAGE; 4) A NEW CONDENSED MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR (CMP) ZONE IS IDENTIFIED, WHICH PROVIDES NEW CELL SOURCES FOR RP AND MC EXPANSION; AND 5) ENDOCHONDROGENESIS PLAYS A KEY FUNCTION IN THE MANDIBLE REPAIR VIA A SWITCH MECHANISM FROM THE DEFAULT PROGRAM (MEMBRANOUS BONE) TO A TRAUMA REPAIR PROGRAM (ENDOCHONDRAL BONE), WHERE CHONDROGENESIS (WITH LIMITED REQUIREMENT OF ANGIOGENESIS) OCCURS FIRST, FOLLOWED BY CHONDROCYTE TRANS- DIFFERENTIATION INTO BONE. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE MANDIBLE BODY IS COMPOSED OF BOTH ENDOCHONDRAL AND MEMBRANOUS BONES, AND THAT ENDOCHONDROGENESIS PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN MANDIBLE REPAIR. TO TEST THIS CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS, THREE HIGHLY RELATED, YET INDEPENDENT SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED: 1) TO DETERMINE HOW MC AND RP CONTRIBUTE TO MANDIBLE FORMATION VIA CHONDROCYTE TRANS-DIFFERENTIATION; 2) TO DELINEATE THE MECHANISM BY WHICH RP IS DERIVED FROM THE CMP, AND THE CMP-RP, A GROWTH-PLATE LIKE STRUCTURE, CONVERGES AND ELONGATES THE TWO ENDS OF MCS DURING MANDIBLE GROWTH AT CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LEVELS; 3) TO DETERMINE HOW ENDOCHONDROGENESIS CONTRIBUTES TO MANDIBLE REPAIR VIA A SWITCH MECHANISM FROM THE DEFAULT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (MEMBRANOUS BONE) TO A TRAUMA REPAIR PROGRAM (ENDOCHONDRAL BONE) THROUGH A CHANGE IN THE STEM CELL FATE. COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL 1) DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CMP-RP-MC COMPLEX CONTRIBUTES TO MANDIBLE GROWTH VIA THE TRANS-DIFFERENTIATION OF RP-MC CHONDROCYTES INTO BONE CELLS; AND 2) IDENTIFY SOME OF KEY FACTORS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SWITCH FROM MEMBRANOUS OSTEOGENESIS TO ENDOCHONDROGENESIS VIA A CHANGE OF THE STEM CELL FATE IN THE REPAIR PROCESS.

THIS CAREER DEVELOPMENT K02 AWARD WOULD PROVIDE THE PROTECTED TIME 1) TO GAIN EXPERTISE IN PHYSICAL ANALYSIS OF SKELETAL TISSUES, INCLUDING MICRO-CT, FIB-SEM AND QLF, AND 2) TO ESTABLISH COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXPERTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE FIELD. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROJECT AIMS TO CHARACTERIZE THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF FLUORINATED POLLUTANTS PFAS (PER- AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES OR ORGANOFLUORINE COMPOUNDS) ON TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. PFAS ARE A GROUP OF MAN-MADE ORGANOFLUORINE COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID (PFOA) AND PFOA PRECURSOR, FLUOROTELOMER ALCOHOLS (FTOHS). PFAS DO NOT READILY BREAKDOWN IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND ARE WATER-SOLUBLE. PFAS CAN BE FOUND IN DRINKING WATER AND LIVING ORGANISMS, INCLUDING FISH, ANIMALS AND HUMANS WHERE PFAS CAN BUILD UP AND PERSIST OVER TIME. LABORATORY ANIMAL STUDIES SHOWED THAT PFAS CAN CAUSE TUMORS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ON REPRODUCTIVITY, DEVELOPMENT AND IMMUNE SYSTEM. PREVIOUS STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT FTOHS (PRECURSOR OF PFOA) INDUCED TOOTH MALFORMATION, INCLUDING DEGENERATION OF AMELOBLASTS IN RODENT INCISORS. HOWEVER, EXAMINATION OF HOW FTOHS ALTER TOOTH PHENOTYPE (PHYSICAL AND HISTOLOGICAL) IS LIMITED AND THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF HOW FTOHS AFFECT TOOTH DEVELOPMENT ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF PFAS ADVERSE EFFECTS ON ODONTOGENESIS. OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO ESTABLISH PFAS (HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL) USE IN AN ANIMAL MODEL AND DETERMINE HOW FTOHS AFFECT AMELOGENESIS IN VIVO. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT FTOHS INDUCE DNA DAMAGE AND MITOCHONDRIAL DAMAGE TO PERTURB AMELOBLAST FUNCTION DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT THAT RESULTS IN ENAMEL MALFORMATION. OUR HYPOTHESIS HAS BEEN FORMULATED BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWING THAT PFOA INHIBITED CELL PROLIFERATION, INDUCED APOPTOSIS, DNA DAMAGE AND MITOCHONDRIAL DAMAGE IN AMELOBLAST-LIKE CELL (LS8 CELLS). THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEFINE THE EFFECTS OF PFAS ON TOOTH DEVELOPMENT AND TO HIGHLIGHT THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN TOOTH MALFORMATION. ONCE PFAS ADVERSE EFFECTS ARE IDENTIFIED IN TOOTH FORMATION, PFAS COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A POSSIBLE CAUSATIVE FACTOR FOR CRYPTOGENIC ABNORMALITIES IN DENTINOGENESIS, INCLUDING MOLAR INCISOR HYPOMINERALISATION (MIH) OF WHICH THE ETIOLOGY IS UNKNOWN.

PROPER FACIAL DEVELOPMENT IN MOUSE AND HUMAN REQUIRES THREE SETS OF PAIRED FACIAL PROMINENCES COMING TOGETHER BY GROWTH, MORPHOGENESIS, AND FUSION. EMBRYONIC FACIAL DEVELOPMENT IS STRIKINGLY SIMILAR IN HUMAN AND MOUSE, MAKING THE MOUSE THE BEST AVAILABLE MODEL SYSTEM FOR HUMAN. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE EXPRESSION OF MANY THOUSANDS OF GENES CHANGES ACROSS TISSUE LAYER, AGE, AND/OR PROMINENCE, AS WELL AS CELL POPULATION DURING EARLY MOUSE FACIAL DEVELOPMENT.

SUICIDE IS THE 10TH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH, AND 1 PERSON DIES BY SUICIDE EVERY 11 MINUTES IN THE US. AMONG INDIVIDUALS AT HIGHER RISK OF SUICIDE ARE CHRONIC DISEASE SUFFERERS, INCLUDING CANCER SURVIVORS. THE SUICIDE MORTALITY RATE FOR HNC PATIENTS IS 63.4 PER 100,000 PERSON-YEARS, WHICH IS FOUR TIMES MORE THAN THE GENERAL US POPULATION. CLEARLY, SUICIDE IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN THE US AND IS CONSIDERED A LEADING HEALTH INDICATOR BY THE HEALTHY PEOPLE INITIATIVE. SCREENING FOR SUICIDAL IDEATION IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED SUICIDE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS FEASIBLE AND EFFECTIVE TO SCREEN PATIENTS FOR SUICIDAL IDEATION AND BEHAVIOR IN VARIOUS CLINICAL SETTINGS, INCLUDING GENERAL, NON-PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM SETTINGS. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) HAS ENDORSED THE COLUMBIA SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE (C-SSRS) AS THE TOOL OF CHOICE FOR SCREENING FOR SUICIDAL IDEATION AND BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER, SUICIDE SCREENING INTERVENTIONS AMONG HNC PATIENTS ARE LACKING, IN PART DUE TO THE GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MULTILEVEL BARRIERS ASSOCIATED WITH SCREENING HNC PATIENTS FOR RISKS OF SUICIDE. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, THE CANDIDATE WILL UTILIZE THE C-SSRS TO CHARACTERIZE SUICIDE RISK AMONG HNC PATIENTS, AND TEST EFFECTIVENESS AND POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTABILITY OF THE C- SSRS AS A ROUTINE SUICIDE SCREENING TOOL IN HNC CARE. USING INFORMANT INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS, CANDIDATE WILL IDENTIFY PATIENT, PROVIDER AND OTHER BARRIERS THAT COULD UNDERLIE THE SUBOPTIMAL INVESTIGATION OF SUICIDAL IDEATION AMONG HNC PATIENTS IN AIM 1. IN AIM 2, CANDIDATE WILL ADMINISTER THE C-SSRS TO A GROUP OF HNC PATIENTS, PROVIDING INSIGHTS ON SUICIDAL IDEATION AND SEVERITY AMONG HNC PATIENTS IN THE US. IN ADDITION, A RISK MANAGEMENT/TRIAGE SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE FOLLOW-UP CARE WHEN SUICIDE RISK IS DETECTED. AIM 3 WILL INVOLVE A MIXED-METHOD EVALUATION WITH A SUBSET OF PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED THE C-SSRS FROM AIM 2 TO ELICIT FEEDBACK ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE C-SSRS, AND A DEBRIEF WITH PROVIDERS TO ASSESS FUTURE IMPLEMENTABILITY OF THE C-SSRS AS ROUTINE PART OF HNC CARE. THIS RESEARCH WILL HAVE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT BY ENHANCING OUR ENHANCING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BARRIERS TO SCREENING FOR SUICIDE IN THE HNC SETTING. IT WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL IMPACT THROUGH THE NOVEL UTILIZATION OF THE C-SSRS IN HNC CARE. LESSONS LEARNED WILL BE ADOPTED FOR FUTURE STUDIES IN HNC AND ACROSS THE CANCER CONTINUUM.

FRANCA'S TRANSITION TO SCIENTIFIC INDEPENDENCE. DR. FRANCA IS A DENTIST-SCIENTIST, AND HER LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO LEAD A RESEARCH PROGRAM TO (I) DEVELOP IMMUNOMODULATORY BIOMATERIALS FOR DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL REGENERATION AND (II) TO CREATE TISSUE CHIPS TO UNDERSTAND AND TREAT ORAL DISEASES. THE SCIENTIFIC GOAL OF THIS K01 IS TO DEVELOP AN IMMUNOMODULATORY SCAFFOLD FOR DENTAL PULP REGENERATION. DESPITE UNDENIABLE PROGRESS TO DEVELOP REGENERATIVE STRATEGIES FOR THE DENTAL PULP, NECROTIC TEETH PRESENT CHALLENGING CONDITIONS FOR REGENERATION. EVEN AFTER CAREFUL DISINFECTION, A PREVIOUSLY INFECTED ROOT CANAL'S MICROENVIRONMENT HAS REMNANT LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE (LPS) THAT ACTIVATES IMMUNE CELLS INTO A PRO-INFLAMMATORY STATE INCOMPATIBLE WITH TISSUE REGENERATION. RECENTLY, EARLY EVENTS OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE WERE SHOWN TO HIGHLY INFLUENCE TISSUE ENGINEERING STRATEGIES' SUCCESS. ESPECIALLY, MACROPHAGE RESPONSES TO BIOMATERIALS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ESSENTIAL MEDIATORS OF SCAFFOLD REMODELING AND PROMISING TARGETS FOR IMMUNE-MEDIATED REGENERATIVE STRATEGIES. THESE CELLS CAN RESPOND TO EXTERNAL STIMULI BY CHANGING THEIR PHENOTYPE FROM PRO-INFLAMMATORY TO PRO-REGENERATIVE, WITH MANY INTERMEDIATE STATES, IN A PROCESS KNOWN AS M1/M2 POLARIZATION. THESE TWO STATES ARE HIGHLY PLASTIC, FUNCTION SYNERGISTICALLY, AND CAN BE MODULATED BY THE SCAFFOLD'S PROPERTIES. WHEN A SCAFFOLD FOR DENTAL PULP REGENERATION IS PLACED IN CONTACT WITH LPS-CONTAMINATED DENTIN, IT CAN BE EXPECTED THAT M1 ACTIVATION WILL PERSIST WITHOUT PROVIDING THE PRO-REGENERATIVE ENVIRONMENT NECESSARY FOR TISSUE FORMATION. SMALL ANTIBODIES OR NANOBODIES HAVE BEEN USED TO NEUTRALIZE LPS IN GRAM-NEGATIVE INFECTIONS AND TARGET PATHOGENS IN SCARCELY ACCESSIBLE TISSUE MICROENVIRONMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS THERAPEUTIC TOOL HAS NOT BEEN USED FOR DENTAL REGENERATION PURPOSES. OUR OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AN IMMUNOMODULATORY SCAFFOLD THAT NEUTRALIZES LPS AND INCREASES THE M2/M1 RATIO IN THE SCAFFOLD-TISSUE INTERFACE WILL PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE PRO-REGENERATIVE MICROENVIRONMENT MORE FAVORABLE TO DENTAL PULP TISSUE FORMATION. HENCE, OUR GOAL IS TO ENGINEER A NOVEL NANOBODY-LADEN PHOTOCROSSLINKABLE HYDROGEL WITH FINE-TUNED STIFFNESS AND THE ABILITY TO NEUTRALIZE DENTIN LPS. THIS SCAFFOLD WILL ENABLE CONTROLLABLE GUIDANCE OF M1 MACROPHAGES ACTIVATION, MINIMIZING THEIR PRESENCE WITHIN THE ROOT CANAL SO THAT INCOMING MONOCYTES CAN POLARIZE INTO M2 CELLS, INFILTRATE THE HYDROGEL, AND SECRET AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE MILIEU TO FOSTER DENTAL PULP TISSUE FORMATION. WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING AIMS: (AIM 1) TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF SCAFFOLD'S STIFFNESS ON M1/M2 MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION, (AIM 2) TO NEUTRALIZE DENTIN LPS AND REDUCE M1 POLARIZATION, AND (AIM 3) TO EVALUATE THE NANOBODY-LADEN SCAFFOLD'S IMMUNOMODULATORY CAPACITY IN VIVO.

I AM TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT COMBINING A DIETARY ANTIOXIDANT WITH PROTON RADIATION WILL IMPROVE OUTCOME IN PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCER (HNC). THIS AWARD WILL PROVIDE ME WITH THE RESOURCES I NEED TO ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING GOALS: (1) TO BECOME A LEADING EXPERT IN PROTON RADIATION AS WELL AS NOVEL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE OUTCOME IN PATIENTS WITH HNC. (2) TO COMPLETE THE RESEARCH AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION. (3) TO INCREASE THE VISIBILITY OF, TO MENTOR AND TO PROMOTE INCLUSION OF RESEARCHERS WHO ARE UNDERREPRESENTED OR WHO ARE FROM A DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUND IN THE FIELD OF HNC. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, I HAVE ASSEMBLED A MULTIDISCIPLINARY MENTORSHIP TEAM WITH COMPLEMENTARY EXPERTISE. THESE INCLUDE: (1) DR. VINITA TAKIAR (PRIMARY MENTOR, RADIATION ONCOLOGY AND HNC), (2) DR. SUSAN WALTZ (CO-PRIMARY MENTOR, TUMOR GROWTH, SENIOR RESEARCHER, MICROENVIRONMENT AND METASTASIS), (3) DR. TRISHA WISE-DRAPER (COMMITTEE MEMBER, HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY AND HNC), (4) DR. SUSANNE WELLS (COMMITTEE MEMBER, SENIOR RESEARCHER, ORGANOIDS, PROTON AND PHOTON RADIATION, AND HNC). RESISTANCE TO THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT IN HEAD AND NECK SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (HNSCC), A FORM OF HNC, SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TO INCREASED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. AS SALVAGE OPTIONS REMAIN LIMITED, THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED TO DEVELOP NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES TO EXTEND SURVIVAL IN PATIENTS WITH HNSCC. PREVIOUS RESEARCH BY THE PI AND OTHERS HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DIETARY ANTIOXIDANT ISOTHIOCYANATE COMPOUNDS CAN SENSITIZE CANCER CELLS TO RADIATION AND CYTOKINE. ISOTHIOCYANATES ALSO PROTECT NORMAL CELLS FROM THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES BY IMPROVING TREATMENT RESPONSE. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO TEST WHETHER ISOTHIOCYANATE, PHENETHYL ISOTHIOCYANATE (PEITC), IN COMBINATION WITH PROTON RADIATION, GENERATES INCREASED DNA DAMAGE AND LETHALITY IN HNSCC CELLS. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE COMBINATION OF PROTON RADIATION WITH PEITC IS SUPERIOR TO THE CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE COMBINATION, WHICH IS CISPLATIN WITH PHOTON BEAM THERAPY (XRT). TO EXAMINE THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS, WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) EXAMINE HOW PEITC ENHANCES PROTON RADIATION MEDIATED CELL DEATH AND 2) INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PEITC IN PROTECTING NORMAL HEAD AND NECK CELLS FROM RADIATION. DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE RADIATION RESPONSE IS SIGNIFICANT SINCE FAILED RESPONSE TO RADIATION RESULTS IN DECREASED PATIENT SURVIVAL. THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL IS INNOVATIVE IN THAT IT FOCUSES ON UTILIZING WELL- TOLERATED, DIETARY ANTIOXIDANTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY TO OVERCOMING RADIATION RESISTANCE IN HNSCC AND EMPLOYS THE USE OF CUTTING EDGE PROTON RADIATION.

MISREGULATION OF NEURAL CREST DEVELOPMENT RESULTS IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CRANIOFACIAL MALFORMATIONS AND BIRTH DEFECTS. THUS, UNCOVERING THE MOLECULAR AND GENETIC UNDERPINNINGS OF NEURAL CREST FORMATION HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF THESE PATHOLOGIES. NEURAL CREST DEVELOPMENT IS ORCHESTRATED BY A MULTI-LEVEL GENE REGULATORY NETWORK, IN WHICH PROGENITOR CELLS ARE PROGRESSIVELY COMMITTED TO A NEURAL CREST FATE. THIS PROCESS REQUIRES NOT ONLY SHIFTS IN GENE EXPRESSION BUT ALSO AN EXTENSIVE REMODELING OF THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE. THE CHROMATIN REMODELING EVENTS WHICH OCCUR BETWEEN TWO RESPECTIVE STAGES OF NEURAL CREST FORMATION, INDUCTION AND SPECIFICATION, ARE DRIVEN IN PART BY THE ACTION OF THE PIONEER FACTOR TFAP2A. TFAP2A ACTIVATES DISTINCT SETS OF GENOMIC REGIONS DURING INDUCTION AND SPECIFICATION OF NEURAL CREST CELLS, AND ITS TARGET SPECIFICITY IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS DIMERIZATION WITH PARALOGOUS PROTEINS TFAP2C AND TFAP2B. THIS HETERODIMERIC SWITCH BETWEEN TFAP2A/C AND TFAP2A/B ACTS TO DRIVE THE TRANSITION FROM INDUCTION TO SPECIFICATION, ALLOWING FOR PROGRESSIVE CELL FATE COMMITMENT OF NEURAL CREST CELLS. CONSISTENT WITH THIS IDEA, TFAP2B EXPRESSION IS BOTH NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT TO DRIVE THE TRANSITION FROM INDUCTION TO SPECIFICATION. ANALYSIS OF AN ENHANCER OF TFAP2B HAS IMPLICATED SMAD2/3 NUCLEAR EFFECTORS AS PREDICTED DRIVERS OF TFAP2B EXPRESSION. THIS OBSERVATION HAS LED TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT TFAP2 PIONEER FACTORS INTEGRATE ENVIRONMENTAL SIGNALS INTO THE GENE REGULATORY NETWORK TO DRIVE THE TRANSITION FROM INDUCTION TO SPECIFICATION WITHIN THE NEURAL CREST LINEAGE. THE F99 PHASE OF THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF SMAD NUCLEAR EFFECTORS AND THEIR UPSTREAM SIGNALING SYSTEMS IN THE CONTROL OF TFAP2B EXPRESSION AND CONSEQUENTLY THE NEURAL CREST SPECIFICATION PROGRAM. THIS WORK WILL SHED LIGHT ON HOW ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI ACT TO REMODEL THE CHROMATIN LANDSCAPE WITHIN THE PRESUMPTIVE NEURAL CREST. MOREOVER, WHILE MUCH FOCUS HAS BEEN PAID TO UNDERSTAND THE CIS-REGULATORY CONTROL OF NEURAL CREST CELL FORMATION, WE STILL HAVE VERY LITTLE INSIGHT ON THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE CELLS DIFFERENTIATE TO FORM THE BONE AND CARTILAGE OF THE FACE.

THUS, UNCOVERING THE MOLECULAR AND GENETIC UNDERPINNINGS OF NEURAL CREST FORMATION HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF THESE PATHOLOGIES. NEURAL CREST DEVELOPMENT IS ORCHESTRATED BY A MULTI-LEVEL GENE REGULATORY NETWORK, IN WHICH PROGENITOR CELLS ARE PROGRESSIVELY COMMITTED TO A NEURAL CREST FATE. THIS PROCESS REQUIRES NOT ONLY SHIFTS IN GENE EXPRESSION BUT ALSO AN EXTENSIVE REMODELING OF THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE. THE CHROMATIN REMODELING EVENTS WHICH OCCUR BETWEEN TWO RESPECTIVE STAGES OF NEURAL CREST FORMATION, INDUCTION AND SPECIFICATION, ARE DRIVEN IN PART BY THE ACTION OF THE PIONEER FACTOR TFAP2A. TFAP2A ACTIVATES DISTINCT SETS OF GENOMIC REGIONS DURING INDUCTION AND SPECIFICATION OF NEURAL CREST CELLS, AND ITS TARGET SPECIFICITY IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS DIMERIZATION WITH PARALOGOUS PROTEINS TFAP2C AND TFAP2B.

THE UNEXPECTED FINDING OF STREPTOCOCCI IN THE HUMAN ORAL CAVITY WHICH PREFERENTIALLY BIND TO NEU5GC LED US TO QUESTION WHETHER THIS PREFERENCE PREVENTS THESE BACTERIA FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AND KILLED BY NEUTROPHILS. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HUMAN NEUTROPHILS, LACKING NEU5GC, ARE ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY ELIMINATE NEU5GC-BINDING STREPTOCOCCI WILL BE ADDRESSED BY THIS PROPOSAL. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT STREPTOCOCCAL PREFERENCE FOR SPECIFIC SIALIC ACID-CONTAINING EPITOPES RESULTS IN DIFFERENT RESPONSES OF NEUTROPHILS ENCOUNTERING THESE STREPTOCOCCI. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY INCUBATING STREPTOCOCCAL STRAINS WHICH EXHIBIT DIFFERENTIAL BINDING TO NEU5AC AND NEU5GC WITH NEUTROPHILS DISPLAYING EITHER NEU5AC, NEU5GC, OR WHICH ARE DEVOID OF SIALIC ACIDS. IN AIM 1, NEUTROPHIL ACTIVATION AND PHAGOCYTOSIS OF STREPTOCOCCI BASED ON SIALIC ACID SUBTYPE PREFERENCE IS EXAMINED. AIM 2 WILL IDENTIFY SPECIFIC SIALOGLYCOPROTEINS ON THE SURFACE OF NEUTROPHILS WHICH ARE BOUND BY EITHER NEU5AC- OR NEU5GC-SPECIFIC STREPTOCOCCI OR THEIR PURIFIED ADHESIN PROTEINS. WE WILL ALSO TEST HOW THESE INTERACTIONS WITH CELL SURFACE SIALOGLYCOPROTEINS CONTRIBUTE TO NEUTROPHIL ACTIVATION AND PHAGOCYTOSIS OF THE STREPTOCOCCI.

TO DETERMINE THE FULL SCOPE OF DIVERSE SIA-BINDING SRRP SEQUENCES ENCODED BY STREPTOCOCCI, THE APPLICANT USED HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY SIA-BINDING SRRPS AMONG OVER SIX THOUSAND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE STREPTOCOCCAL GENOME SEQUENCES. THE APPLICANT IDENTIFIED HUNDREDS OF SIA-BINDING SRRP SEQUENCES, WHICH LIKELY REFLECT BINDING SPECIFICITIES FOR DIFFERENT SIA SUBTYPES.

A KEY FACTOR IN ALLOWING A PATHOGEN TO ESTABLISH ITSELF AND COLONIZE DESPITE THESE ODDS IS SUCCESSFULLY REGULATING THE EXPRESSION OF VIRULENCE FACTORS WHILE ACQUIRING ENOUGH ESSENTIAL NUTRITION FOR REPLICATION AND GROWTH. ONE SUCH ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT IS FOLATE, WHICH IS CLASSICALLY LINKED TO MODULATION OF VIRULENCE IN MICROBES.

THE DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES USED BY THE NEURAL CREST ARE STILL ELUSIVE, BUT SEEM TO BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO GENETIC PERTURBATIONS BECAUSE HERITABLE DISEASES FREQUENTLY DISRUPT NEURAL CREST DEVELOPMENT, WHICH CAN IMPACT CRANIOFACIAL GROWTH. THUS, CLARIFYING HOW CELL INTERACTIONS BIAS NEURAL CREST CELL FATES COULD REVEAL MECHANISMS OF DISEASE PROGRESSION, MANY OF WHICH REMAIN OBSCURE. TO PERFORM A SYSTEMATIC CHARACTERIZATION OF NEURAL CREST LINEAGES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL REGULATION BY CELL SIGNALING, WE HAVE BUILT UPON OUR RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN SINGLE-CELL TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSIS TO INCLUDE VIRAL GENE DELIVERY FOR FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION. USING BARCODE-BASED CLONAL LINEAGE TRACING AND HIGH- THROUGHPUT GENETIC PERTURBATIONS IN VIVO VIA ULTRASOUND-GUIDED INJECTIONS OF LENTIVIRUS INTO THE FORMING CRANIAL NEURAL CREST REGION, WE WILL MAP HOW CELL LINEAGES INTERACT AND DIVERSIFY TO BUILD THE FACE.

WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS BY FUNCTIONAL EXPERIMENTS TARGETING RECEPTORS AND LIGANDS IN NEURAL CREST SUBPOPULATIONS, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON GENES THAT WHEN MUTATED, CAN RESULT IN PATHOLOGY.

BEING AWARDED THIS F31 WILL OFFER MR. EURE THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE HIS LONG-TERM GOAL OF BECOMING A LEADER IN SCIENCE AND PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. PERIODONTAL DISEASE IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE AFFECTING UP TO 42% OF ADULTS IN THE US OVER THE AGE OF 30. PERIODONTAL DISEASE IS ORCHESTRATED BY VARIOUS MICROORGANISMS THAT MAKE UP THE SUBGINGIVAL MICROBIOTA. IN SUSCEPTIBLE INDIVIDUALS, DYSBIOSIS OF THE SUBGINGIVAL MICROBIOTA PROMOTES A DYSREGULATED INFLAMMATION THAT CAUSES AN IRREVERSIBLE DESTRUCTION OF THE SOFT AND HARD TISSUES SUPPORTING THE TEETH. PORPHYROMONAS GINGIVALIS (PG) IS AN ORAL BACTERIUM COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE MICROBIAL DYSBIOSIS LEADING TO PERIODONTAL DISEASE. PG IS REFERRED TO AS A PATHOBIONT BECAUSE ITS KNOWN TO MANIPULATE THE HOST INFLAMMATORY MILIEU TO FACILITATE DISEASE STATES, HOWEVER PG CAN ALSO REMAIN IN THE ORAL CAVITY DURING HEALTHY STATES. THE VARIOUS MECHANISMS BEHIND HOW PG CONTRIBUTES TO THE CHANGING INFLAMMATORY MILIEU IS YET TO BE IDENTIFIED. OUR LAB HAS DISCOVERED PG SPHINGOLIPIDS (SLS) LIMIT HOST INFLAMMATION AND HOST CELL SL TRANSFER VIA OUTER MEMBRANE VESICLES IS A POTENTIAL TRANSPORT MECHANISM FOR PG. THE MECHANISM OF OMV UPTAKE BY HOST CELLS IS KNOWN TO IMPACT ELICITED INFLAMMATION AND OMV COMPOSITION (SL+ OR SL-) PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE ROUTE FOR OMV UPTAKE. MYELOID DIFFERENTIATION FACTOR 88 (MYD88) IS ALSO KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN THE INNATE IMMUNE SENSING OF PG OMVS AND HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE A TARGET FOR IMMUNOMODULATION BY PG. I HYPOTHESIZE PG SLS FACILITATES AN OMV UPTAKE MECHANISM THAT LIMITS INFLAMMATION AND THAT SLS PROMOTE AN IMMUNOMODULATORY MECHANISM LINKED TO TARGETING OF MYD88. I PLAN TO USE THE THP-1 HUMAN CELL LINE AND PRIMARY HUMAN MACROPHAGES TO CHARACTERIZE THE UPTAKE MECHANISM OF SL-CONTAINING PG OMVS (AIM 1) AND TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF MYD88 IN PG SL-MEDIATED IMMUNOMODULATION (AIM 2).", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "369ac1e4-8d93-3063-b933-3586dffba549-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F31DE033255_7529"}, {"internal_id": 160579816, "Award ID": "F31DE033220", "Award Amount": 48494.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2023-06-30", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "ECM REMODELING AND CROSSTALK WITH CELL FATE IN ZEBRAFISH LIGAMENT REGENERATION - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  HEALTHY JOINTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES AND THE LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY IS OSTEOARTHRITIS. LIGAMENT INJURY RESOLVES WITH FIBROUS SCAR TISSUE THAT DESTABILIZES THE JOINT DUE TO INFERIOR SCAR TISSUE. THERE ARE NO ADEQUATE TREATMENTS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM DUE TO THE LIMITED CAPACITY OF OUR LIGAMENTOCYTES TO REGENERATE NATIVE TISSUE. CURRENT MODELS USED TO STUDY LIGAMENT REPAIR EXPERIENCE FIBROTIC HEALING AND ARE INSUFFICIENT IN ADDRESSING THIS CHALLENGE TO REGENERATE. OUR LAB HAS DEVELOPED A NOVEL ZEBRAFISH MODEL TO STUDY THE BASIC BIOLOGY UNDERLYING INTEROPERCULAR MANDIBULAR (IOM) CRANIOFACIAL LIGAMENT REGENERATION. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS THAT AFTER IOM TRANSECTION, ZEBRAFISH REGENERATE A SCAR-FREE LIGAMENT WITHIN A MONTH. WE SHOW THAT LIGAMENTOCYTES DEDIFFERENTIATE AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE REGENERATED LIGAMENT. THIS TIGHTLY REGULATED REGENERATIVE RESPONSE IS CHARACTERIZED BY CONSTANT CROSSTALK BETWEEN THE DYNAMICALLY CHANGING EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX (ECM) AND THE DIFFERENT CELL POPULATIONS PRESENT IN THE INJURY MICROENVIRONMENT. FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A LEGUMAIN (LGMN) MUTANT ZEBRAFISH MODEL THAT EXPERIENCES FIBROTIC HEALING TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR REGULATION OF REGENERATION VS. FIBROSIS. LGMN IS A CYSTEINE PROTEASE INVOLVED IN ECM REMODELING AND WE SHOW THAT LGMN MUTANTS HEAL WITH A MIS-PATTERNED, SCARRED LIGAMENT AFTER TRANSECTION. IN CONTRAST TO WT REGENERATION, LGMN MUTANT FIBROTIC HEALING IS CHARACTERIZED BY A DEFECT IN LIGAMENTOCYTE DEDIFFERENTIATION, FAILURE TO INTEGRATE NEW AND OLD TISSUE, AND DISORGANIZED COLLAGEN THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF LIGAMENT HEALING. TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF LGMN-MEDIATED REGENERATION, THIS PROPOSAL WILL IDENTIFY THE SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION AND MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF LGMN IN THE CONTEXT OF CRANIOFACIAL LIGAMENT REGENERATION. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALSO CHARACTERIZE THE PROTEOMIC PROFILE OF THE ZEBRAFISH IOM LIGAMENT DURING HOMEOSTASIS, REGENERATION, AND FIBROSIS. THIS WILL YIELD NEW KNOWLEDGE ON DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED PROTEINS DURING THESE DIFFERENT STATES THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY POTENT MOLECULAR REGULATORS OF A PRO-REGENERATIVE MICROENVIRONMENT. OUR PRELIMINARY SCRNASEQ ANALYSIS SHOWS A SUBSET OF MACROPHAGES AT THE INJURY SITE THAT EXPRESS ECM REMODELING FACTORS INCLUDING LGMN. FOLLOWING IOM TRANSECTION, LGMN MUTANTS HAVE LESS MACROPHAGES PRESENT AT THE INJURY SITE. TOGETHER, THIS INDICATES AN IMPORTANT ROLE OF MACROPHAGE-DERIVED LGMN IN MEDIATING A PRO- REGENERATIVE MICROENVIRONMENT. TO TEST THIS, I PLAN TO USE SCRNASEQ TO CHARACTERIZE CHANGES IN MACROPHAGE SUBSETS BETWEEN WT AND LGMN MUTANTS. FURTHER, I WILL FUNCTIONALLY TEST LGMN MUTANT MACROPHAGES AND USE ADOPTIVE MACROPHAGE TRANSFER TO TEST IF LGMN MUTANT SCARRED HEALING IS RESCUED. THROUGH THESE AIMS, I WILL UNCOVER THE ROLE OF LGMN IN MEDIATING THE INJURY MICROENVIRONMENT DURING LIGAMENT REGENERATION. UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF DR. JOANNA SMEETON AND DR.

EBV IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH SALIVA AND ESTABLISHES INFECTION IN THE ORAL CAVITY WHERE IT THEN ESTABLISHES A LATENT INFECTION FOR LIFE IN MEMORY B CELLS. IN MOST INDIVIDUALS THIS INFECTION WILL REMAIN BENIGN, BUT EBV-ASSOCIATED DISEASES INCLUDE INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS AND CANCERS, MORE COMMONLY IN IMMUNE- COMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS.

EBV REACTIVATES IN RESPONSE TO A DIVERSE RANGE OF STRESSORS INCLUDING DNA DAMAGE, HYPOXIA, HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS AND ACTIVATION OF THE B-CELL RECEPTOR.

MAGNETIC RESONANCE-GUIDED TRANSCRANIAL FOCUSED ULTRASOUND (TMRGFUS) IS A NON- INVASIVE THERAPEUTIC MODALITY USED TO TREAT A WIDE VARIETY OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. TMRGFUS RELIES ON TIGHTLY FOCUSING THE ULTRASOUND BEAM THROUGH THE INHOMOGENEOUS HUMAN SKULL.

NOTABLY, TLRS AND IL-1R FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ELEVATED LOCALLY (IN SALIVARY TISSUE) AND IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD CELLS OF SS PATIENTS, SUGGESTING THESE RECEPTORS CONTRIBUTE TO SS. THE SPECIFIC LIGANDS AND RECEPTORS THAT MEDIATE ACTIVATION OF MYD88-DEPENDENT PATHWAYS IN PSS HAVE NOT, AS YET, BEEN EVALUATED IN DEPTH. TLR7 IS A MYD88-DEPENDENT ENDOSOMAL TLR THAT IS IMPLICATED IN MANY AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, ALTHOUGH ITS ROLE IN PSS REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT B CELL-INTRINSIC TLR7-DEPENDENT SIGNALING NETWORKS DRIVE PSS PATHOGENESIS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY HOW TLR7 ACTIVATION OF B CELLS GOVERNS PSS DISEASE PATHOGENESIS. WE WILL EMPLOY A PSS MOUSE MODEL (NOD.B10) AND A KNOCKOUT STRAIN OF NOD.B10 MICE DEVELOPED IN OUR LABORATORY THAT LACKS EXPRESSION OF TLR7. THESE MICE PROVIDE A UNIQUE MODEL SYSTEM TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF TLR7 IN PSS DIRECTLY. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROPOSAL RESTS ON THE FACT THAT IN LUPUS, A RELATED AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE, TLR7 ACTIVATION OF B CELLS IS CRITICAL FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA REVEAL THAT TLR7 AGONISM ACCELERATES PSS DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTES EXPANSION OF AGE-ASSOCIATED B CELLS (ABCS), A B CELL SUBSET IMPLICATED IN AUTOIMMUNITY IN MICE AND HUMANS, BUT ONE THAT REMAINS POORLY UNDERSTOOD IN PSS. WE WILL TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS BY COMPLETION OF TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) ASSESS TLR7-DEPENDENT B CELL ACTIVATION IN PSS MICE IN VITRO AND (2) IDENTIFY SPECIFIC B CELL SUBSETS THAT MEDIATE PATHOLOGY IN PSS IN A TLR7-DEPENDENT MANNER IN VIVO. THIS STUDY IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT WILL UNCOVER NEW MECHANISMS RELATED TO THE ROLE OF MYD88-DEPENDENT SIGNALING NETWORKS IN PSS AND WILL IDENTIFY HOW TLR7 ACTIVATION IN B CELLS GOVERNS SPECIFIC DISEASE MANIFESTATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT WILL REVEAL NEW MECHANISMS THAT GOVERN CHRONIC INFLAMMATION IN PSS. INSIGHTS OBTAINED FROM THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL REVEAL NOVEL PATHWAYS AND SPECIFIC CELL TYPES THAT CAN BE TARGETED TO TREAT PSS AND OTHER AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES.

THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO DISSECT THE MOLECULAR UNDERPINNINGS GOVERNING MIDFACE DEVELOPMENT AND HOW THEIR DYSREGULATION CAUSES DYSPLASIA. WE AND OTHERS HAVE INDEPENDENTLY UNCOVERED KEY MIDFACE GENES THAT FUNCTION WITHIN THE NEURAL CREST, AN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL POPULATION THAT GIVES RISE TO FACIAL BONE AND CARTILAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, DELETION OF ALX1/3/4 (ALX), WHOSE LOSS CAUSES SYNDROMIC FORMS OF FRONTONASAL DYSPLASIA, LEAD TO A SEVERE MIDFACIAL CLEFT IN MICE. OUR LAB HAS FOUND THAT LOSS OF TFAP2 IN THE NEURAL CREST COMPROMISES EXPRESSION OF ALX GENES AND PRESENTS THE SAME MIDFACE CLEFT AS THE ALX KNOCKOUT EMBRYOS.

I RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MM OF MICE AND PRIMATES IS PREDOMINANTLY INNERVATED BY MYELINATED A-FIBERS WITH UNIQUE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND RECEPTOR COMPOSITIONS. TO FURTHER UNRAVEL THE IDENTITY OF THESE NEURONS WE PERFORMED SINGLE-CELL RNA SEQUENCING AND HAVE IDENTIFIED UNIQUE TYPES OF NEURONS THAT INNERVATE THE MM. SELECTIVE MARKERS CAN BE USED FOR SPECIFIC MANIPULATION OF ACTIVITIES FOR THESE NEURONAL CLUSTERS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEFINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF MM INNERVATING TG NEURONAL GROUPS IN THE PROGRESS OF TMDM CHRONICITY.

EVEN WITH CLINICAL INTERVENTION, SYSTEMIC CANDIDIASIS HAS A MORTALITY RATE OF ~40%. OPC INVOLVES THE FORMATION OF BIOFILMS IN THE ORAL MUCOSA THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE C. ALBICANS MORPHOTYPES, INCLUDING BOTH YEAST AND HYPHAL CELLS. THE ABILITY OF C. ALBICANS TO FORM DIFFERENT CELL TYPES IS CRUCIAL FOR VIRULENCE AND CONTRIBUTES TO ITS CAPACITY TO COLONIZE DIFFERENT HOST TISSUES.  THE TRANSITION BETWEEN YEAST AND HYPHAL CELLS IS REGULATED BY A NETWORK OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS (TFS) THAT INCLUDE THE CO-REPRESSOR SSN6. DELETION OF SSN6 BLOCKS FORMATION OF HYPHAL CELLS AND ATTENUATES C. ALBICANS VIRULENCE. SSN6 IS ALSO INTEGRAL TO A SECOND TF NETWORK THAT REGULATES TRANSITIONS BETWEEN \u2018WHITE\u2019 AND \u2018OPAQUE\u2019 STATES THAT EXHIBIT DIFFERENT TISSUE TROPISMS IN THE HOST. IMPORTANTLY, THE BENNETT LAB HAS UNCOVERED THAT MULTIPLE TFS (INCLUDING SSN6) IN BOTH NETWORKS CONTAIN PRION-LIKE DOMAINS (PRLDS) AND THAT THESE CAN PROMOTE PHASE SEPARATION OF THE CORRESPONDING PROTEINS. PHASE SEPARATION REFERS TO THE PROCESS OF LIQUID DEMIXING THAT CAN GENERATE PROTEIN CONDENSATES WITH LIQUID-LIKE PROPERTIES.

HISTORICALLY, THESE STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED CP CASES AS A WHOLE, RATHER THAN BY STRATIFYING BY THE SUBTYPES OF CP THAT ARE DEFINED BY THE PART OF THE PALATE THAT IS AFFECTED.

DURING THE CHRONIC RESPONSE TO A TUMOR, CD8 T CELLS ENTER AN EXHAUSTED CELL STATE \u2013 A DYSFUNCTIONAL PHENOTYPE CHARACTERIZED BY DECREASED ABILITY TO LYSE TARGET CELLS. EXPRESSION OF THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR THYMOCYTE SELECTION-ASSOCIATED HMG BOX (TOX) IS CRITICAL FOR INDUCING CD8 T CELL EXHAUSTION AND IS ENRICHED IN THE EXHAUSTED CD8 T CELL SUBSET WITHIN SINGLE CELL RNA-SEQ DATASETS OF OCSCC PATIENT TUMOR SAMPLES. THE GENES THAT ARE DIRECTLY TRANSCRIPTIONALLY REGULATED BY TOX THAT PROMOTE CD8 T CELL DYSFUNCTION AND MAY BE THERAPEUTICALLY TARGETED, HOWEVER, REMAIN POORLY DEFINED. IN ADDITION TO TOX, MALIGNANT CELL SIGNALS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO CD8 T CELL DYSFUNCTION AND ICI RESISTANCE. WE DISCOVERED A HYBRID EPITHELIAL/MESENCHYMAL (HEM) MALIGNANT CELL STATE IN OCSCC THAT LOCALIZES TO THE TUMOR EDGE ADJACENT TO CD8 T CELLS AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH EXHAUSTION OF THESE ADJACENT CD8 T CELLS. THE MECHANISMS OF HEM CELLS UNDERLYING THIS ASSOCIATION ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT CD8 T CELL DYSFUNCTION IN OCSCC IS DRIVEN BY THE DIRECT GENE TARGETS OF TOX IN CD8 T CELLS AND BY IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE CONTACT AND PARACRINE SIGNALING FROM HEM CELLS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEFINE MECHANISMS OF CD8 T CELL DYSFUNCTION THAT MAY BE TARGETED TO IMPROVE ICI THROUGH THE FOLLOWING AIMS: IN AIM 1, THE DIRECT GENE TARGETS OF TOX AND THEIR ROLE IN CD8 T CELL DYSFUNCTION WILL BE DEFINED IN VITRO USING CD8 T CELLS ISOLATED FROM OCSCC SAMPLES. IN AIM 2, PATIENT-DERIVED CD8 T CELLS WILL BE CO-CULTURED WITH PATIENT-MATCHED OCSCC TUMOR-DERIVED ORGANOIDS OR CANCER CELL LINES EXPRESSING A MODEL ANTIGEN. IN THESE CO-CULTURES, HEM- SPECIFIC MEMBRANE AND SECRETED PROTEINS WILL BE KNOCKED-DOWN IN THE MALIGNANT CELLS TO DETERMINE THEIR ROLE IN SUPPRESSING CD8 T CELLS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE MECHANISTIC INSIGHT INTO CD8 T CELL DYSFUNCTION IN OCSCC, THEREBY SUPPORTING DEVELOPMENT OF NEW STRATEGIES TO THERAPEUTICALLY ACTIVATE CD8 T CELLS AND IMPROVE ICI AND OCSCC OUTCOMES.

PORPHYROMONAS GINGIVALIS (P.G) IS A MAJOR PERIODONTOPATHIC, FASTIDIOUS, PATHOBIONT AND SUCCESSFUL COLONIZER OF GINGIVAL MUCOSA, WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN IDENTIFIED TO INDUCE A SPECIAL FORM OF AUTOPHAGY IN HUMAN GINGIVAL EPITHELIAL CELLS (GECS). WHILE GECS FUNCTION AS AN INTRINSICALLY IMPORTANT FIRST LINE OF IMMUNE DEFENSE OF THE GINGIVA, GECS CAN BE EXPLOITED BY P.G FOR SECURING A SUCCESSFUL PERSISTENCE NICHE IN THE ORAL MUCOSA AND A POTENTIAL SYSTEMIC DISSEMINATION ROUTE. DESPITE THE GROWING EVIDENCE PINPOINTING THAT ALTERED GLN METABOLISM CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CELLULAR PATHOLOGIES, KNOWLEDGE GAPS REMAIN REGARDING HOW HOST GLN METABOLISM COULD BE INFLUENCED BY BACTERIA TO REGULATE HOST REDOX HOMEOSTASIS AND POTENTIALLY PROMOTE BACTERIAL SURVIVAL IN THE GECS.

A PREVIOUS PHOSPHOPROTEOMIC SCREEN DEMONSTRATED THAT AKT PHOSPHORYLATES THE RNA-BINDING PROTEIN (RBP) SERINE/ARGININE-RICH SPLICING FACTOR 3 (SRSF3) DOWNSTREAM OF PI3K-MEDIATED PDGFRA SIGNALING IN MOUSE EMBRYONIC PALATAL MESENCHYME (MEPM) CELLS, LEADING TO TRANSLOCATION OF PHOSPHORYLATED SRSF3 INTO THE NUCLEUS. SRSF3 IS UBIQUITOUSLY EXPRESSED WITH ENHANCED EXPRESSION IN THE NEURAL CREST-DERIVED MESENCHYME AND OVERLYING ECTODERM OF MOUSE FACIAL PROCESSES AT MID-GESTATION. ADDITIONALLY, ABLATION OF SRSF3 IN THE MURINE NEURAL CREST CELL LINEAGE (CKO) RESULTS IN A SEVERE MIDLINE FACIAL CLEFTING PHENOTYPE DUE TO DEFECTS IN PROLIFERATION AND SURVIVAL OF CRANIAL NEURAL CREST CELLS. FURTHER, RNA-SEQUENCING OF SRSF3 CKO FACIAL PROCESS MESENCHYME IDENTIFIED ALTERNATIVE RNA SPLICING EVENTS THAT WERE ENRICHED FOR TRANSCRIPTS ENCODING PROTEIN SERINE/THREONINE KINASES, SUGGESTING THAT ALTERNATIVE SPLICING MAY SERVE AS A NOVEL FEEDBACK MECHANISM FOR INTRACELLULAR KINASE SIGNALING. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PI3K/AKT-MEDIATED PDGFRA SIGNALING REGULATES SRSF3 PROTEIN AND RNA INTERACTIONS TO AFFECT THE ALTERNATIVE RNA SPLICING OF TRANSCRIPTS NECESSARY FOR CRANIOFACIAL DEVELOPMENT. FIRST, SRSF3 WILL BE IMMUNOPRECIPITATED FROM MEPM CELLS IN THE ABSENCE OR PRESENCE OF PDGF-AA LIGAND AND ANALYZED BY MASS SPECTROMETRY TO COMPREHENSIVELY MAP PHOSPHORYLATION CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO PDGFRA SIGNALING. FURTHER, CRANIOFACIAL PHENOTYPES WILL BE ANALYZED IN A SRSF3 PHOSPHOMUTANT KNOCK-IN MOUSE MODEL TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF AKT- MEDIATED PHOSPHORYLATION OF SRSF3 IN CRANIOFACIAL DEVELOPMENT. NEXT, BIOID2 PROXIMITY LABELING AND MASS SPECTROMETRY WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY SRSF3 PROTEIN INTERACTING PARTNERS IN RESPONSE TO PDGFRA SIGNALING IN MEPM CELLS. FINALLY, SRSF3-RNA INTERACTIONS WILL BE PURIFIED AND SEQUENCED IN RESPONSE TO PDGFRA SIGNALING IN MEPM CELLS THROUGH ENHANCED CROSSLINKING AND IMMUNOPRECIPITATION ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY DIRECT TARGETS OF SRSF3 AND DETERMINE IF RNA BINDING AND/OR SEQUENCE SPECIFICITY CHANGES UPON SRSF3 PHOSPHORYLATION.

WHILE PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS INVESTIGATED WHETHER ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE COULD LEAD TO EARLIER DETECTION, MY PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THESE PREVIOUS STUDIES MISS A CRITICAL FEATURE OF ORAL CANCER CONTROL: ACCESS TO DENTAL SERVICES. PHYSICIANS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED TO SYSTEMATICALLY SCREEN FOR ORAL CANCER, WHEREAS DENTISTS ROUTINELY SCREEN FOR ORAL CANCER AS STANDARD OF CARE. MY PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AFFIRM THE CRITICAL ROLE OF DENTISTS IN ORAL CANCER CONTROL SYSTEMS. YET, DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF DENTAL SERVICES FOR DETECTING ORAL CANCER EARLY, LOW-INCOME ADULTS FACE FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO ACCESSING DENTAL SERVICES. IN FACT, THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE DENTAL COVERAGE LEADS ADULTS TO DELAY OR FORGO NECESSARY DENTAL CARE MORE THAN ANY OTHER HEALTHCARE SERVICE. MEDICAID HAS FILLED THE DENTAL COVERAGE GAP FOR MANY ADULTS, BUT STATES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDED DENTAL BENEFITS TO THEIR ADULT MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES. CONSEQUENTLY, ADULT MEDICAID DENTAL PROGRAMS HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME AND VARY BY STATE. THE VOLATILITY OF MEDICAID DENTAL COVERAGE COULD BE FURTHER EXACERBATING DELAYS IN ORAL CANCER DETECTION FOR LOW-INCOME ADULTS.

THIS INFLAMMATION IS CHARACTERIZED BY DECREASED MECHANICAL PAIN THRESHOLDS, OR MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA. WHILE ROOT CANAL TREATMENTS RELIEVE AP PAIN IN MOST CASES, ~7-12% OF PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE ENDODONTIC PAIN >6 MONTHS AFTER THE PROCEDURE, WITH FEMALES BEING FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN MALES TO EXPERIENCE POST-OPERATIVE CHRONIC PAIN. CURRENT PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS POSE SERIOUS RISKS SUCH AS ADDICTION, UNWANTED SIDE EFFECTS, AND OVERDOSE. THEREFORE, THE YET UNKNOWN MECHANISMS THAT PUT FEMALES AT RISK FOR GREATER PAIN DUE TO AP NEED TO BE ELUCIDATED TO ALLOW FOR POTENTIAL NEW THERAPIES THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS PREVALENT CLINICAL PRESENTATION. USING PRECLINICAL MODELS OF AP, WE DISCOVERED THAT PROLACTIN IS HIGHLY EXPRESSED WITHIN THE AP SITE IN FEMALE MICE, NOT MALE MICE. BECAUSE OF ITS EMERGING SEX-SPECIFIC PRO-NOCICEPTIVE EFFECTS, PROLACTIN SIGNALING COULD BE A PROMISING TARGET FOR TREATING FEMALE AP PATIENTS. THUS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT INCREASED PROLACTIN LEVELS MEDIATE A SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC AP-MEDIATED MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA WITH GREATER ALLODYNIA IN FEMALE COMPARED TO MALE MICE. TO ADDRESS THIS CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS, AIM 1 WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CELL-SPECIFIC PROLACTIN AND PROLACTIN RECEPTOR (PRLR) EXPRESSION IS INCREASED IN FEMALES IN A MOUSE MODEL OF AP. HERE, WE WILL INDUCE AP BY CREATING A PULP EXPOSURE AND ALLOW FOR INFECTION IN THE MAXILLARY FIRST MOLAR OF MALE AND FEMALE MICE. THE INFECTION WILL MANIFEST OVER THE COURSE OF 3, 7, 14, AND 21 DAYS, AT WHICH POINT, WE WILL DETERMINE THE PERCENTAGE OF PROLACTIN- AND PROLACTIN RECEPTOR-EXPRESSION CELLS IN THE PERIAPICAL LESION.

TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTCOMING, OUR LAB HAS DEVELOPED THE HIGHLY REGENERATIVE ZEBRAFISH AS A MODEL FOR CRANIOFACIAL LIGAMENT REGENERATION. ZEBRAFISH HAVE THE REMARKABLE CAPACITY TO REGENERATE THEIR LIGAMENTS WITHOUT SCARRING IN UNDER A MONTH. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT THE JAW JOINT-SUPPORTING INTEROPERCLE (IOP) LIGAMENT IN ZEBRAFISH SHOWS IDENTICAL MORPHOLOGY TO THE UNINJURED LIGAMENT AS SOON AS 28 DAYS AFTER TRANSECTION.

THEREFORE, THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW ORAL BACTERIA, BOTH KEYSTONE PATHOGENS AND NORMALLY COMMENSAL, AFFECT AND RESPOND TO NEUTROPHIL PHENOTYPES. THE ROLE NEUTROPHILS PLAY IN INNATE IMMUNITY IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THROUGHOUT THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH COMMUNITY AS IS THE IMPORTANCE OF PHAGOSOME DEVELOPMENT TO NEUTROPHIL MEDIATED KILLING. DESPITE THESE CELLS BEING THE PREDOMINANT PHAGOCYTES IN PERIODONTAL TISSUE, THE INFLUENCE OF A CHANGING PHAGOSOME ENVIRONMENT ON BACTERIA INVOLVED IN PERIODONTAL DISEASE HAS YET TO BE FULLY EXPLORED IN NEUTROPHILS. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE SURVIVAL OF SG AND PG IS DEPENDENT ON THEIR COOPERATIVITY IN EVADING NEUTROPHIL DEFENSE MECHANISMS. TO INVESTIGATE THIS HYPOTHESIS THIS PROJECT AIMS TO (1) INVESTIGATE HOW ACTIVATION OF NEUTROPHILS, INCLUDING BY PG, MODULATES NEUTROPHIL PHAGOSOMAL MATURATION DYNAMICS AND (2) INVESTIGATE HOW PG AND SG ACT COLLABORATIVELY TO INCREASE THEIR SURVIVAL AND INFLAMMATION. TO ACHIEVE THESE AIMS A WIDE VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES, FROM CLASSICAL CELL BIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES TO ADVANCED MICROSCOPY, FLOW CYTOMETRY AND IMAGE ANALYSIS WILL BE USED. COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE A VALUABLE STEP IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE COOPERATIVE MECHANISMS OF COMMENSAL BACTERIA WITH PERIODONTAL PATHOGENS CONTRIBUTE TO EVADING NEUTROPHIL-MEDIATED KILLING.

ONE OF THESE HERV ELEMENTS IS THE PROTEIN SYNCYTIN- 1, ENCODED BY THE ERVW1 GENE, AND IS ESSENTIAL FOR PLACENTAL DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH THESE ELEMENTS ARE EPIGENETICALLY SILENCED AFTER EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT, EXOGENOUS VIRAL INFECTIONS, SUCH AS EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS (EBV), HAVE BEEN LINKED TO ENHANCED EXPRESSION OF HERVS (3-7).

EBV THEN SPREADS TO MEMORY B CELLS WHERE IT PERSISTS FOR THE LIFE OF THE HOST, GENERALLY IN A LATENT STATE. DURING LATENCY, ONLY A SMALL SUBSET OF EBV GENES ARE EXPRESSED (8). PERIODICALLY, EBV UNDERGOES LYTIC ACTIVATION IN A SUBSET OF B CELLS TO PERSIST IN THE POPULATION. IMPORTANTLY, LYTIC ACTIVATION OF EBV NOT ONLY INCREASES RISKS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF EBV-RELATED CANCERS, PARTICULARLY IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED HOSTS, BUT MAY ALSO BE EXPLOITED TO TREAT EBV-ASSOCIATED CANCERS IN AN APPROACH KNOWN AS ONCOLYTIC THERAPY. LYTIC ACTIVATION IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE EXPRESSION OF OVER 80% OF EBV GENES, MANY OF WHICH SERVE IN IMMUNE EVASION, REGULATION OF APOPTOSIS, AND BLOCKADE OF HOST PROTEIN SYNTHESIS. THIS LATTER PHENOMENON RESULTS IN THE DOWNREGULATION OF MOST HOST GENES, KNOWN AS GLOBAL HOST SHUTOFF, AND THE PREFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF VIRAL GENES (9).

NEXT, I WILL INVESTIGATE THE DIFFERENCES IN MPMRI BETWEEN PRIMARY TUMORS/NODES OF RAPID THERAPY RESPONDERS AND NON-RESPONDERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY USE AI TO BUILD A RESPONSE PREDICTION MODEL (SPECIFIC AIM 2). FINALLY, I WILL CHARACTERIZE AREAS OF PRIMARY TUMOR TREATMENT RESISTANCE AT THE REGIONAL AND VOXEL LEVEL ON MPMRI AND SUBSEQUENTLY USE AI TO BUILD A RESISTANCE CLASSIFICATION MODEL (SPECIFIC AIM 3). THROUGH DEDICATED TRAINING PROPOSED IN THIS F31 AWARD, I WILL GAIN EXPERTISE IN CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT TOOL IMPLEMENTATION AND DESIGN (TRAINING GOAL 1), DEVELOP METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS FOR DEEP LEARNING IN MEDICAL IMAGING (TRAINING GOAL 2), GAIN EXPERTISE IN STATISTICAL MODELING AND CLINICAL INFORMATICS APPROACHES (TRAINING GOAL 3), AND TRANSITION FROM GRADUATE RESEARCH TO MENTORED POST-GRADUATE RESEARCH AND EVENTUAL INDEPENDENT PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR STATUS (TRAINING GOAL 4).

THIS CONDITION IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF TOOTH-SUPPORTING STRUCTURES RESULTING FROM DYSBIOSIS BETWEEN THE HOST IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE NORMALLY COMMENSAL ORAL BIOFILM. TREPONEMA DENTICOLA, TREPONEMA MALTOPHILIUM, AND TREPONEMA LECITHINOLYTICUM ARE THREE UNDERSTUDIED BACTERIAL SPECIES ABUNDANT IN THE POLYMICROBIAL BIOFILM ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE PERIODONTAL DISEASE, AND A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR PATHOGENIC PROPERTIES IS LACKING. T. DENTICOLA, THE MOST-WELL- STUDIED ORAL SPIROCHETE, HAS A PROMINENT VIRULENCE FACTOR: THE MAJOR OUTER SHEATH PROTEIN (MSP) THAT DYSREGULATES THE FUNCTIONS OF HOST CELLS, INCLUDING NEUTROPHILS. T. MALTOPHILIUM AND T. LECITHINOLYTICUM HAVE MSP-LIKE OUTER MEMBRANE PROTEINS CALLED MSPA AND MSPTL, RESPECTIVELY. NEUTROPHILS ARE KEY INNATE IMMUNE CELLS THAT PROTECT ORAL TISSUES FROM PATHOGENIC BACTERIA BY COORDINATING CELLULAR SIGNALING, STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS, AND CELL FUNCTION. MSP INHIBITS NEUTROPHIL FUNCTION BY DISRUPTING THE BALANCE OF PHOSPHOINOSITIDES, CELLULAR LIPID METABOLITES KEY FOR INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING. THIS DISRUPTION INVOLVES ALTERED REGULATION OF THE PI3 KINASE (PI3K) AND PHOSPHATASE AND TENSIN HOMOLOG (PTEN) AXIS, LEADING TO INAPPROPRIATE REMODELING OF THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON, IMPAIRED CHEMOTAXIS, AND ALTERED FUNCTIONING OF NEUTROPHILS.

OFCS OCCUR WHEN THE MOUTH OR LIP DOES NOT FORM PROPERLY DURING EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT. MOST OFCS ARE NON-SYNDROMIC, OCCURRING AS ISOLATED CASES, AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS A COMPLEX GENETIC DISORDER. PREVIOUS GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWAS) HAVE IDENTIFIED COMMON GENETIC VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED OFC RISK, ALTOGETHER ACCOUNTING FOR 25% OF THE KNOWN HERITABILITY. HOWEVER, THE REMAINING SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF HERITABILITY THAT IS UNACCOUNTED FOR MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO RARE CODING AND NON- CODING GENETIC VARIANTS AS THEY TEND TO HAVE LARGE EFFECT SIZES. VARIOUS STUDIES IN FAMILIES WITH OFCS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED WHOLE-EXOME SEQUENCING (WES) AND WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING (WGS) TO IDENTIFY RARE CAUSAL MUTATIONS, BUT RARE VARIANTS HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLORED IN LARGE OFC COHORTS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT RARE VARIANTS CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO CLEFT RISK IN NON-SYNDROMIC OFC FAMILIES AND WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF THESE VARIANTS IN TWO LARGE NON-SYNDROMIC OFC COHORTS, ONE CONSISTING OF 72 FAMILIES WITH WES DATA AND THE OTHER COHORT CONSISTING OF 815 OFC TRIOS (PARENTS AND AFFECTED CHILD) WITH WGS DATA.

SUCCESSFUL RESTORATION OF A FUNCTIONAL DENTITION REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENDOGENOUS BONE REPAIR PROCESS. OFTEN OVERLOOKED, ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS IN OSSEOUS WOUND REPAIR AFTER TRAUMA, SUCH AS IN A DENTAL EXTRACTION, IS CELL DEATH AND SUBSEQUENT APOPTOTIC CELL (AC) CLEARANCE (EFFEROCYTOSIS) BY MACROPHAGES. AS A RESULT OF EFFEROCYTOSIS, MACROPHAGES SECRETE A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT FACILITATE REGENERATION, AND SWIFTLY ALTER THEIR BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO A MULTITUDE OF PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL MICROENVIRONMENTAL CUES. CC-MOTIF CHEMOKINE LIGAND 2 (CCL2), WHICH IS SECRETED BY MACROPHAGES, MEDIATES MESENCHYMAL STEM/PROGENITOR CELL (MSPC) RECRUITMENT TO THE WOUND SITE. ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS WORK HAS LARGELY FOCUSED ON BIOCHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT DRIVE CCL2 PRODUCTION, PRELIMINARY DATA IN THE CURRENT PROPOSAL SUGGESTS THAT THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF AC ENGULFMENT DRIVES CYTOSKELETAL EVENTS AND SUBSEQUENT MECHANOTRANSDUCTIVE SIGNALING. ENGULFMENT OF APOPTOTIC CELLS INDUCES CHANGES IN MACROPHAGE SHAPE, ACTIN ORGANIZATION, AND NUCLEAR ARCHITECTURE THAT LIKELY INITIATES CCL2 PRODUCTION. UNDERSTANDING EFFEROCYTOSIS-INDUCED INTRACELLULAR FORCES AND RESULTING SIGNALING WILL INFORM THE DESIGN OF APOPTOTIC CELL MIMICS (ACM) AS A REGENERATIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WHOSE AGE OR CO-MORBIDITIES IMPAIR WOUND HEALING CAPACITY. THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF EFFEROCYTOSIS-INDUCED MACROPHAGE MECHANOTRANSDUCTION IN BONE REPAIR AND TO PROMOTE REPARATIVE MACROPHAGE BEHAVIOR USING ACM, HENCE CATALYZING THE ENDOGENOUS OSSEOUS WOUND HEALING RESPONSE. THE OVERALL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT MACROPHAGES PROMOTE OSTEOGENIC REPAIR THROUGH EFFEROCYTOSIS-DRIVEN BIOPHYSICAL SIGNALING, WHICH CAN BE RECAPITULATED USING APOPTOTIC CELL MIMICRY FOR A REGENERATIVE ADVANTAGE. THE TWO AIMS PROPOSED ARE: 1) TO CONNECT CCL2 EXPRESSION AND MACROPHAGE PHENOTYPE WITH AC AND ACM ENGULFMENT-INDUCED CHANGES TO THE CYTO- AND NUCLEOSKELETON, AND 2) TO OPTIMIZE AND DELIVER ACM TO PROMOTE MACROPHAGE-DRIVEN OSTEOGENESIS AND IMPROVE BONE REPAIR IN A CLINICALLY RELEVANT ORAL OSSEOUS WOUND HEALING MODEL.

IN CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS, THE SYSTEM IS DYSREGULATED, CONTRIBUTING TO A FACILITATED PAIN STATE. THE OUTPUT OF THIS PAIN-MODULATING SYSTEM, VIA THE ROSTRAL VENTROMEDIAL MEDULLA (RVM) HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED. BIDIRECTIONAL PAIN CONTROL FROM THIS REGION IS MEDIATED BY TWO PHYSIOLOGICALLY DEFINED CELL CLASSES, \u201cON-CELLS\u201d AND \u201cOFF-CELLS,\u201d THAT RESPECTIVELY FACILITATE AND INHIBIT NOCICEPTIVE TRANSMISSION. HOWEVER, SENSORY INPUTS TO RVM ARE ONLY NOW RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION. INDIRECT INPUTS FROM THE DORSAL HORN VIA THE PARABRACHIAL COMPLEX CONVEY NOCICEPTIVE INFORMATION TO RVM AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE SENSITIZATION OF RVM NEURONS IN PERSISTENT INFLAMMATORY PAIN. HOWEVER, THERE ALSO IS EVIDENCE FROM ANATOMICAL STUDIES FOR A DIRECT INPUT FROM THE DORSAL HORN TO RVM. THE HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT RVM RECEIVES BOTH INDIRECT AND DIRECT FUNCTIONAL INPUTS FROM THE TRIGEMINAL DORSAL HORN THAT CONTRIBUTE TO PAIN-MODULATION, AND THAT THE DIRECT INPUT IS ALTERED IN A PERSISTENT PAIN STATE. THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON THE TRIGEMINAL SYSTEM, WHICH MEDIATES SENSORY INPUT FROM THE FACE AND HEAD, REGIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A HEAVY BURDEN OF CHRONIC PAIN, INCLUDING MIGRAINE HEADACHE, TEMPOROMANDIBULAR DISORDER, AND TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA. I WILL USE A COMBINATION OF SINGLE-CELL RECORDING IN RVM COMBINED WITH OPTOGENETIC MANIPULATION OF THE DIRECT (TRIGEMINAL-TO-RVM) AND INDIRECT (TRIGEMINAL RELAY THROUGH PARABRACHIAL COMPLEX) PROJECTIONS TO TEST THE ROLE OF EACH CONNECTION TO RVM AND DETERMINE WHETHER AND HOW THE FUNCTION OF THE DIRECT PATHWAY CHANGES IN PERSISTENT PAIN.

ANTI-PD1 IS NOW APPROVED IN THE FIRST- AND SECOND-LINE SETTINGS, INDICATING THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE TUMORS ARE RESISTANT TO TREATMENT. THE FIELD AWAITS THE RESULTS OF MULTIPLE TRIALS TESTING WHETHER COMBINING IMMUNOTHERAPY AND RT CAN HELP AVOID RESISTANCE TO RT, BUT MANY PRECLINICAL STUDIES (INCLUDING THOSE FROM OUR LAB) INDICATE THAT TREATMENT RESISTANCE STILL DEVELOPS DESPITE SUCH COMBINATIONS. THE PREFERENTIAL RECRUITMENT OF UNIQUE IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE CELL SUBTYPES AFTER RT TO THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT (TME) IN RESPONSE TO RT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROMOTION OF TUMOR GROWTH AND PROGRESSION. THE TUMOR ENDOTHELIUM CAN ACT AS A SELECTIVE BARRIER THAT REGULATES THE ENTRY, STABILITY, AND ACTIVATION STATUS OF IMMUNE CELLS, BUT THE MECHANISTIC UNDERPINNINGS OF THIS BARRIER ACTIVITY REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE EPHB4 RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE AND ITS LIGAND EPHRINB2 DEFINE NOVEL MOLECULAR TARGETS. UPON CELL TO CELL CONTACT, BOTH EPHB4 AND EPHRINB2 CAN SIGNAL VIA THEIR CYTOPLASMIC DOMAINS. THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED IN CELL MIGRATION AND ANGIOGENESIS IN EARLY EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT, LITTLE HAS BEEN PUBLISHED ON THEIR ROLE IN MODULATING THE CANCER IMMUNE MICROENVIRONMENT.

THUS, ELABORATION OF THE PROCESSES GUIDING NEURAL CREST FORMATION IS IMPERATIVE FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF PATHOLOGIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CELL TYPE. NEURAL CREST CELLS ARE INDUCED BY THE COMBINED ACTION OF SIGNALING SYSTEMS AT THE NEURAL PLATE BORDER, A STRIPE OF PROGENITOR CELLS ADJACENT TO THE NEURAL PLATE. OPPOSING MORPHOGEN GRADIENTS OF WNTS AND FGFS ARE CENTRAL FOR PROGENITOR CELLS TO DECIDE BETWEEN THESE TWO FATES: INDUCTION OF THE NEURAL CREST REQUIRES HIGH LEVELS OF WNTS AND LOW LEVELS OF FGFS, WHILE HIGH LEVELS OF FGFS DRIVE CELLS TOWARDS A NEURAL FATE. RECENT STUDIES HIGHLIGHT THE REQUIREMENT OF A PRECISE COMBINATION OF SIGNALS FOR NEURAL PLATE BORDER INDUCTION, BUT WE STILL HAVE A SUPERFICIAL UNDERSTANDING FOR HOW LEVELS OF FGF AND WNT ARE FINE-TUNED TO JUMPSTART THE NEURAL CREST GENETIC PROGRAM.

MOST HNSCC PATIENTS WILL DIE WITHIN THE FIRST 30 MONTHS OF DISEASE, AN ABYSMAL STATISTIC LARGELY REFLECTING A LACK OF EFFECTIVE TREATMENT STRATEGIES. THIS CHALLENGE HIGHLIGHTS THE CURRENT UNMET NEED TO IDENTIFY 1) DISTINCT MOLECULAR SUBGROUPS OF HNSCC AND 2) PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS THAT CAN INFORM SUBGROUP-SPECIFIC TREATMENT PLANS. MY LAB HAS IDENTIFIED A PREVIOUSLY UNAPPRECIATED HNSCC SUBGROUP DEFINED BY ALTERATION IN NSD1, A HISTONE METHYLTRANSFERASE ENZYME MUTATED IN UP TO 15% OF HPV(-) HNSCC. NSD1 HAS SPECIFIC DI-METHYLASE ACTIVITY TARGETING HISTONE H3 LYSINE 36 (H3K36). THE FORMATION OF METHYLATED H3K36 IS ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN CHROMATIN AND TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION. THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTINCT FEATURES OF NSD1- MUTANT HPV(-) HNSCC TUMORS, INCLUDING A) INCREASED PATIENT SMOKING HISTORY AND MUTATIONAL BURDEN; B) A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PROGNOSIS; AND C) REDUCED IMMUNE CELL INFILTRATION IN THE TUMOR. THESE CORRELATIVE FINDINGS SUGGEST A ROLE OF NSD1 IN MODULATING HNSCC TUMOR RESPONSIVENESS TO CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS AND IMMUNE- TARGETING TREATMENTS, YET THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP AND THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM REMAIN UNCLEAR. BUILDING ON OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND THE COMBINED EXPERTISE OF MY SPONSORS AND CONSULTANTS, MY PROPOSAL WILL TEST THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT NSD1-INACTIVATION FACILITATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS THAT ARE POORLY IMMUNE-INFILTRATED AND SENSITIVE TO TREATMENT WITH CISPLATIN. TO MODEL NSD1 LOSS IN ORAL SQUAMOUS CARCINOGENESIS, I HAVE GENERATED CONDITIONAL NSD1 KNOCKOUT (KO) MICE TO SPECIFICALLY DELETE NSD1 IN THE TONGUE EPITHELIUM.

IN AIM 2, I WILL INVESTIGATE THE OBSERVATION THAT NSD1-MUTANT HNSCC PATIENTS LIVE LONGER, WHICH IS HYPOTHESIZED TO REFLECT ENHANCED SENSITIVITY TO CISPLATIN. I WILL DETERMINE IF CISPLATIN TREATMENT PROVIDES A SURVIVAL BENEFIT IN TUMOR-BEARING NSD1 KO MICE. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM, I WILL PERFORM CHIP-SEQ OF NSD1 AND ATAC-SEQ TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT NSD1 DIRECTLY BINDS TO, OR CLOSE TO, GENES IN THE FANCONI ANEMIA PATHWAY, LEADING TO H3K36ME2 ENRICHMENT AND A MORE ACCESSIBLE CHROMATIN STATE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO BROADEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NSD1\u2019S TUMOR SUPPRESSIVE FUNCTION IN HPV(-) HNSCC AND TO ESTABLISH NSD1 AS A CLINICALLY USEFUL BIOMARKER TO GUIDE HNSCC TREATMENT.

THE EARLY STAGE OF GUM DISEASE IS GINGIVITIS, WHICH CONSISTS OF GUMS THAT BLEED WHEN BRUSHING OR FLOSSING TEETH. WHEN LEFT UNTREATED THE LATE STAGE OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE, PERIODONTITIS, CAN LEAD TO TEETH THAT WILL LOOSEN OR EVEN FALL OUT. PERIODONTITIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A GRAM-NEGATIVE ANAEROBIC BACTERIUM CALLED PORPHYROMONAS GINGIVALIS, WHICH IS A KEYSTONE PATHOGEN, MEANING THAT THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY P. GINGIVALIS IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO ITS ABUNDANCE. THE LACK OF GUIDELINES FOR SELECTING AN ANTIBIOTIC REGIMEN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERIODONTITIS HAS LED TO BACTERIA THAT ARE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO OR EVEN RESISTANT TO THE ANTIBIOTICS CURRENTLY USED. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR NOVEL ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS TO SELECTIVELY COMBAT P. GINGIVALIS TO TREAT PERIODONTITIS. RECENTLY, A SCREENING OF A DRUG-REPOSITIONING LIBRARY LOOKING FOR ANTIBACTERIAL COMPOUNDS LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF ZAFIRLUKAST (ZAF) AS A LEAD COMPOUND SHOWING ACTIVITY AGAINST P. GINGIVALIS. FOR MY PROJECT I WANT TO DEVELOP ZAF DERIVATIVES WITH ACTIVITY AGAINST P. GINGIVALIS. IN ORDER TO DO THIS, I HAVE COME UP WITH THREE RESEARCH AIMS. THE FIRST IS TO SYNTHESIZE NOVEL ZAF DERIVATIVES WITH ACTIVITY AGAINST P. GINGIVALIS. THE SECOND AIM IS TO DETERMINE THE TRUE POTENTIAL OF THESE DERIVATIVES AS ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS THROUGH PERCENT GROWTH INHIBITION, MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION, RESISTANCE, AND CYTOTOXICITY EXPERIMENTS. IF THE COMPOUNDS ARE FOUND TO BE POTENT WITH LOW TOXICITY TO MAMMALIAN CELLS, THE EXPERIMENTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO WHICH FUNCTIONAL GROUPS ARE BENEFICIAL OR DETRIMENTAL TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUNDS AND ALLOW FOR FURTHER OPTIMIZATION OF LEAD COMPOUNDS.

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACTERIAL EXPRESSION OF CELL SURFACE-ASSOCIATED ADHESIN PROTEINS FACILITATES THE FORMATION OF BIOFILMS. DENTAL PLAQUE IS A POLYMICROBIAL BIOFILM OF THE HUMAN MOUTH THAT CONTRIBUTES TO ORAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES. FORMATION OF THIS DENTAL BIOFILM IS INITIATED BY PIONEER COLONIZATION, WHEREBY STREPTOCOCCUS SPECIES USE ADHESIN PROTEINS TO ATTACH TO THE SALIVA-COATED TOOTH SURFACE. AMONG THE MANY ADHESINS EXPRESSED BY STREPTOCOCCI, THE ANTIGEN TYPE I/II (AGI/II) ADHESIN FAMILY IS WIDELY CONSERVED AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO MEDIATE INTERACTIONS WITH SEVERAL HOST MOLECULES AND OTHER ORAL MICROBES. THIS PROPOSAL USES STREPTOCOCCUS GORDONII AS A MODEL TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF AGI/II ADHESINS IN HOST SURFACE ATTACHMENT AND BIOFILM DEVELOPMENT. S. GORDONII IS AN ORAL COMMENSAL THAT EXPRESSES TWO AGI/II ADHESINS: SSPA AND SSPB (SSPA/B). EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT SSPA/B IS NECESSARY FOR ATTACHMENT TO SALIVARY MUCIN 5B (MUC5B)-COATED SURFACES. PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS WILL INVESTIGATE BINDING BETWEEN SSPA/B PROTEINS AND MUC5B GLYCANS. THE VARIABLE (V) REGIONS OF SSPA AND SSPB ARE EXPECTED TO DIFFERENTIALLY BIND THE O-GLYCANS DECORATING THE MUC5B PEPTIDE BACKBONE, CONTRIBUTING TO INITIAL ATTACHMENT. SSPA/B EXPRESSION DECREASES, HOWEVER, AS THE BIOFILM MATURES, SUGGESTING THAT TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF SSPA/B IS COMPLEX. DATA SUGGESTS THAT AFTER INITIAL SURFACE ATTACHMENT, PROTEIN ACETYLATION REGULATES SSPAB EXPRESSION VIA THE TWO-COMPONENT SYSTEM BFRAB.

NEVERTHELESS, A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES AND CELLULAR BEHAVIORS THAT REGULATE MORPHOGENESIS IS REQUIRED TO LEVERAGE THESE PROCESSES FOR FUTURE REGENERATIVE THERAPIES THAT CAN MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AGING AND DISEASE. I WILL USE THE EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES OF THE MURINE INCISOR TO STUDY HOW CELL BEHAVIORS DRIVE DIRECTIONAL GROWTH AND MORPHOGENESIS. MURINE INCISOR DEVELOPMENT IS HIGHLY ASYMMETRIC, AND THE MECHANISMS REGULATING THIS PROCESS HAVE REMAINED ELUSIVE. PRIOR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PERTURBATIONS IN SONIC HEDGEHOG (SHH) SIGNALING RESULT IN ABNORMAL INCISOR MORPHOLOGY, AND THAT SHH-DEPENDENT CELL MOVEMENT DRIVES TOOTH BUD INVAGINATION IN THE SYMMETRICAL MOLAR.

LA, AA, AND THEIR METABOLITES COULD BE REGULATING NOCICEPTION THROUGH ACTIVATION OF CHANNELS IN PRIMARY AFFERENT NOCICEPTORS.

IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT VIRAL FACTORS DISRUPT THE SILENCING OF THESE HOST EPIGENETIC ENZYMES DURING LYTIC INFECTIONS. AIM 2 WILL IDENTIFY HOW SPECIFIC KSHV PROTEINS INDUCE THE EXPRESSION OF FOX TF. A COMBINATION OF GENOME-WIDE STUDIES COUPLED WITH KSHV MUTANTS WILL BE USED TO ANALYZE HOW KSHV INFECTION AFFECTS FOX TF REGULATORY REGIONS TO RESULT IN FOX TF INDUCTION. IN SUMMARY, THIS STUDY WILL IDENTIFY A NOVEL VIRAL MECHANISM IN WHICH THE VIRUS EXPLOITS A CENTRAL HOST TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TO DEREGULATE KEY CELLULAR PROCESSES DURING LYTIC INFECTION. THE COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE IN-DEPTH TRAINING IN EPIGENETICS, VIROLOGY AND GENOMICS APPROACHES. THESE SKILLS WILL BE ENHANCED IN THE OUTSTANDING RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT PROVIDED BY THE COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAM IN ORAL BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA COLLEGE OF DENTISTRY, WHICH INCORPORATES TAILORED MENTORSHIP AND EXCELLENT CLINICAL AND RESEARCH TRAINING TO PREPARE THE APPLICANT FOR A CAREER AS A CLINICIAN-SCIENTIST.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "FL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "369ac1e4-8d93-3063-b933-3586dffba549-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F30DE030666_7529"}, {"internal_id": 126271203, "Award ID": "F30DE030358", "Award Amount": 140182.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-02-09", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS OF BONE SIALOPROTEIN IN DENTOALVEOLAR DEVELOPMENT AND HEALING - ABSTRACT: ORAL HEALTH IS VITAL FOR OVERALL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE IMPORTANCE OF TEETH IN MASTICATION, SPEECH, AND ESTHETICS, AND BY RECENT CONNECTIONS MADE BETWEEN ORAL HEALTH AND DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, PRETERM BIRTH, AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. PERIODONTAL DISEASE, THE BREAKDOWN OF THE CONNECTIVE TISSUES AROUND THE TEETH, IS ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT DISEASES ON EARTH, AFFECTING 47% OF ADULTS AND 70% OF ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF 65. THE PERIODONTAL COMPLEX IS A UNIQUE JOINT COMPOSED OF TWO HARD TISSUES, CEMENTUM AND ALVEOLAR BONE, AND AN INTERVENING AND UNMINERALIZED PERIODONTAL LIGAMENT (PDL). PERIODONTAL DISEASE LEADS TO DESTRUCTION OF PERIODONTAL TISSUES AND TOOTH LOSS IF LEFT UNTREATED. THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES TO REGENERATE OR REPAIR PERIODONTAL TISSUES ARE UNPREDICTABLE AT PRESENT, IN PART BECAUSE OF GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE REGARDING MOLECULES GUIDING DENTAL AND PERIODONTAL DEVELOPMENT. OUR GOAL IS TO MORE SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTE PERIODONTAL TISSUE REPAIR, REGENERATION, AND RETURN TO FUNCTION. FACTORS DIRECTING CEMENTUM AND ALVEOLAR BONE MINERALIZATION ARE KEY FOR PROPER PERIODONTAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION, AND LIKELY PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN TISSUE REPAIR. BONE SIALOPROTEIN (GENE: IBSP; PROTEIN: BSP) IS AN EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEIN HIGHLY EXPRESSED DURING CEMENTUM AND ALVEOLAR BONE FORMATION. BSP HAS SEVERAL PUTATIVE BIOLOGICAL ROLES BASED ON ITS HIGHLY CONSERVED FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS INVOLVED IN COLLAGEN BINDING (HYDROPHOBIC N-TERMINAL DOMAIN), HYDROXYAPATITE NUCLEATION (POLYGLUTAMIC ACID SEQUENCES), AND RGD-INTEGRIN CELL SIGNALING (C-TERMINAL MOTIF). BSP WAS DEMONSTRATED TO BE IMPORTANT IN SKELETAL DEVELOPMENT, AS GENETIC ABLATION IN IBSP KNOCKOUT (IBSP-/-) MICE RESULTED IN A SKELETAL PHENOTYPE MARKED BY MILDLY DELAYED LONG BONE MINERALIZATION AND REDUCED TRABECULAR BONE REMODELING. HOWEVER, ABLATION OF BSP CAUSES EVEN MORE DRAMATIC EFFECTS IN DENTOALVEOLAR TISSUES, WHERE IBSP-/- MICE EXHIBITED LACK OF CEMENTUM, SEVERELY HYPOMINERALIZED ALVEOLAR BONE, DISRUPTED DENTAL ATTACHMENT, PERIODONTAL BREAKDOWN, AND TOOTH LOSS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BSP DIRECTS OSTEOBLAST FUNCTION AND MINERALIZATION ACTIVITIES AND PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PERIODONTAL AND ALVEOLAR BONE REPAIR. WE WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS IN THE FOLLOWING THREE AIMS: AIM 1: DEFINE THE BINDING LOCATION OF BSP ON TYPE I COLLAGEN TO DEFINE SPATIAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH BSP MAY CONTRIBUTE TO ECM MINERALIZATION. AIM 2: ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISTIC ROLES OF THE RGD INTEGRIN-BINDING DOMAIN AND THE COLLAGEN- BINDING DOMAIN USING NEWLY GENERATED CEMENTOBLAST CELL LINES AND MUTANT MICE WITH A KNOCK-IN MUTATION INACTIVATING THE RGD MOTIF. AIM 3: INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF BSP TO ENHANCE ALVEOLAR BONE HEALING USING EXOGENOUS NATIVE RAT BSP (NBSP) TO INVESTIGATE ITS USE AS A THERAPEUTIC IN PROMOTING ALVEOLAR BONE REPAIR. IMPORTANTLY, INSIGHTS GAINED WILL AID NOT ONLY IN REGENERATION OF ALVEOLAR BONE SURROUNDING TEETH OR NECESSARY FOR DENTAL IMPLANT PLACEMENT, BUT WILL ALSO BE POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE TOWARDS HEALING CRITICAL SIZE BONE DEFECTS AND FRACTURES, AND AMELIORATING OR REVERSING SYSTEMIC BONE DISORDERS SUCH AS OSTEOPOROSIS.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "OH", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "18478032-6084-4969-2e94-0f121ba8b8b2-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F30DE030358_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110024323, "Award ID": "F30DE030354", "Award Amount": 191520.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-27", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "THE EPIGENETIC ROLE OF LSD1 IN OSTEOCLAST DIFFERENTIATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "MN", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "75c0ae0f-6a5f-aead-72df-d28c71c0d348-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F30DE030354_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110024054, "Award ID": "F30DE030334", "Award Amount": 157366.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-08-27", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "STREPTOCOCCUS MUTANS DIADENYLATE CYCLASE: A PROMISING TARGET FOR PREVENTING DENTAL CARIES", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "AL", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "385a79b6-b810-9612-774a-ef5d04895c34-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F30DE030334_7529"}, {"internal_id": 110024848, "Award ID": "F30DE029989", "Award Amount": 146068.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-09-02", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF 2Q22.1 DELETION IN ORAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bb8d1cd4-e0ae-6348-a07c-04df6a112768-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F30DE029989_7529"}, {"internal_id": 98144397, "Award ID": "F30DE029987", "Award Amount": 209202.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2020-06-11", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "DECIPHERING INFLAMMATORY REGULATION OF ORAL EPITHELIAL PROGENITOR CELLS DURING ORAL MUCOSAL REGENERATION", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "CA", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "bb8d1cd4-e0ae-6348-a07c-04df6a112768-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_F30DE029987_7529"}, {"internal_id": 126270958, "Award ID": "F30DE029986", "Award Amount": 148890.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-02-05", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "MICRORNA REGULATION OF OSTEOCYTE METABOLISM IN BONE REMODELING - MATRIX TURNOVER IN BONE OCCURS THROUGH BONE REMODELING AND IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAINING BONE HOMEOSTASIS AND HEALTH.

THE ABILITY OF OSTEOCYTES TO REGULATE OSTEOBLAST AND OSTEOCLAST ACTIVITY IN BONE REMODELING AND HOMEOSTASIS IS WELL KNOWN, BUT MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT THE DIRECT ROLE OF OSTEOCYTE IN REMODELING VIA PLR IN BONE HOMEOSTASIS OR DISEASE STATES. IN PLR, OSTEOCYTES DIRECTLY RESORB AND DEPOSIT BONE MATRIX SURROUNDING THEIR LACUNO-CANALICULAR NETWORK (LCN). INDEED, OSTEOCYTE-INTRINSIC DELETION OF TGFSS SIGNALING IN TSSRIIOCY-/- MICE CAUSES DEFECTIVE PLR AND BONE QUALITY. FURTHERMORE, PRELIMINARY DATA FROM RNASEQ OF TSSRIIOCY-/- BONE SHOWS SIGNIFICANT MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF HOW TGFSS REGULATES MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION AND PLR IN OSTEOCYTES IS CURRENTLY POORLY UNDERSTOOD. ONE OF THE MOST WELL-KNOWN MOLECULAR REGULATORS OF MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION AND METABOLISM IN OTHER CELL/TISSUE TYPES IS MICRORNAS (MIRS). MIRS ARE ENDOGENOUS, SMALL NON-CODING RNAS THAT FACILITATE SEQUENCE-DEPENDENT POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL GENE REGULATION AND COORDINATELY TARGET GENE NETWORKS OF COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES, SUCH AS CELLULAR METABOLISM. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF MIRS IN MEDIATING OSTEOCYTE MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED. THIS PROJECT WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT OSTEOCYTIC TGFSS SIGNALING REGULATES MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION VIA A MIRNA-DEPENDENT MECHANISM TO CONTROL OSTEOCYTE FUNCTION BY FOCUSING ON A MICRORNA CLUSTER, MIR-181A/B.

AFTER DECADES OF FAILED CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE (AD), THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR CREATIVE APPROACHES TO UNCOVER NEW THERAPEUTIC TARGETS. WHILE WOMEN EXPERIENCE A GREATER PREVALENCE, MORE SEVERE NEUROPATHOLOGY, AND GREATER COGNITIVE DECLINE WITH AD, MEN DIAGNOSED WITH AD PROGRESS MORE QUICKLY TO DEATH. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MECHANISMS (WHETHER HORMONAL OR SEX CHROMOSOMAL) DRIVING THE SEX-BIASED RESPONSE TO AD PATHOLOGY WITH BRAIN AGING. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS GOVERNING THE SEX-BIASED RESPONSE TO AD. RECENT GWAS STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL AD RISK LOCI IN GENES EXCLUSIVELY EXPRESSED BY MICROGLIA, SHIFTING THE FIELD TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL CAUSATIVE ROLES OF MICROGLIA IN AD. AS WELL, MICROGLIA SHOW PROFOUND PHENOTYPIC SEX DIFFERENCES WITH AGING AND AD. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SEX DIFFERENCES IN MICROGLIAL RESPONSIVITY CONTRIBUTE MECHANISTICALLY TO THE SEX-BIASED DISEASE PROGRESSION SEEN IN AD.

ENZYMES, LIKE ALL BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES, ARE THE PRODUCTS OF EVOLUTION: ALL ENZYMES HAVE EVOLVED TO OPERATE WITHIN THE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT OF THE ORGANISM/CELL IN SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NICHES(S). THUS, AN UNDERSTANDING OF ENZYME FUNCTION AND EVOLUTION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO BIOLOGY. ENZYMES ALSO HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL IN MEDICINE (E.G., AS TARGETS FOR ANTI-CANCER, ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTIVIRAL DRUGS AND AS THERAPEUTICS FOR METABOLIC DISORDERS) AND IN INDUSTRY (E.G. TO MAKE IMPORTANT COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND AS CATALYSTS FOR BIOREMEDIATION). OUR CENTRAL PREMISE IS THAT A QUANTITATIVE, MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF ENZYME FUNCTION AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO ORGANISM FITNESS IS CRITICALLY NEEDED TO PRECISELY MANIPULATE ENZYMES AND TO DEEPLY UNDERSTAND BIOLOGY.  TO GENERATE THIS LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING, WE NEED: (1) A QUANTITATIVE, CHEMICAL, AND PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE OF ENZYME FUNCTION, AND (2) MECHANISTIC DATA DESCRIBING HOW AND WHEN THESE PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES CONTRIBUTE TO ENZYME FUNCTION WITHIN THE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS WHERE ENZYMES OPERATE. AN ENHANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PROTEIN SEQUENCE, PROTEIN FUNCTION AND CELLULAR/ORGANISMAL FITNESS WILL HAVE PROFOUND IMPACTS ACROSS BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE, FROM IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT HOW MUTATIONS WILL INFLUENCE THE VIRULENCE AND DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY OF HUMAN PATHOGENS, TO ENHANCING PRECISION MEDICINE BY ACCURATELY PREDICTING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ALLELIC VARIANTS, TO ENABLING THE DESIGN OF NEXT-GENERATION PROTEIN AND CELLULAR THERAPEUTICS. ACHIEVING THIS UNDERSTANDING REQUIRES NEW TOOLS AND A NEW CONCEPTUAL PARADIGM. ENZYMES ARE HIGHLY INTERCONNECTED, THEIR FUNCTIONS ARE MULTIFACETED, AND THEIR CELLULAR ENVIRONMENTS ARE COMPLEX. TRADITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY IS ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL, ALLOWING FOR THE INTENSIVE STUDY OF A FEW INDIVIDUAL ENZYMES IN VITRO (10S) AND PROVIDING DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR CHEMICAL MECHANISMS. BUT IDENTIFYING THE MANY RESIDUES THAT MATTER FOR ENZYME FUNCTION REQUIRES INVESTIGATION OF RESIDUES BEYOND THE ACTIVE SITE AT A SCALE FAR BEYOND THAT OF TRADITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY. FURTHERMORE, THIS BIOCHEMICAL INFORMATION THEN NEEDS TO BE TRANSLATED TO ORGANISM FITNESS IN VIVO IN A QUANTITATIVE MANNER. HERE WE WILL OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. WE WILL FIRST USE EVOLUTIONARY SEQUENCE INFORMATION TO DIRECT ENZYME VARIANT DESIGN TOWARDS FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT AREAS OF SEQUENCE SPACE. WE WILL ADAPT HIGH-THROUGHPUT MICROFLUIDIC TECHNOLOGIES TO QUANTITIVELY MEASURE THE BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES (E.G., KCAT, KM, KI, AND GFOLD) OF THIS LIBRARY OF 104 ENZYME VARIANTS IN VITRO (AIM 1). THEN WE WILL DETERMINE HOW EACH OF THESE VARIANTS AFFECTS ORGANISMAL FITNESS IN VIVO USING POOLED COMPETITION AND BARCODE SEQUENCING ASSAYS (AIM 2). FINALLY, WE WILL USE THIS SEQUENCE-FUNCTION-FITNESS MAP TO TEST LONG-STANDING MODELS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND EVOLUTION AND REVEAL THE BIOCHEMICAL DETERMINANTS OF FITNESS IMPORTANT FOR INDUSTRY AND MEDICINE (AIM 3).

INDEED, WHILE CANONICAL BBB PROPERTIES, SUCH AS PARACELLULAR TIGHT JUNCTIONS AND MINIMAL CAVEOLIN-MEDIATED TRANSCYTOSIS, HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED VIA A HANDFUL OF STANDARD TRACERS, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE TRACERS FULLY REPRESENT THE BBB\u2019S PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS WITH AND PERMEABILITY TO THE THOUSANDS OF CIRCULATING PROTEINS AND CELLS IT IS CONSTANTLY EXPOSED TO.

THUS, I HYPOTHESIZE THAT BRAIN HEALTH IS MAINTAINED NOT JUST BY BBB IMPERMEABILITY\u2014BUT BY SPECIFIC ROUTES OF BLOOD-TO-BRAIN COMMUNICATION ACTIVELY FACILITATED BY THE BBB. SPECIFICALLY, I PROPOSE THAT THERE ARE THREE LOGICAL ROUTES FOR HOW PERIPHERAL INFORMATION IS COMMUNICATED ACROSS THE HEALTHY BBB: THE DIRECT TRANSPORT OF PROTEINS INTO THE BRAIN; THE RESPONSIVE RELAY OF PROTEINS MADE BY THE BBB INTO THE BRAIN; AND THE BBB-LICENSED MIGRATION OF PERIPHERAL IMMUNE CELLS INTO THE BRAIN.

HENCE THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR NEW VACCINE STRATEGIES TO CONTROL THE ONGOING PANDEMIC AND PREVENT FUTURE COV OUTBREAKS. MRNA VACCINES HAVE EMERGED AS AN IDEAL PLATFORM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RAPID-RESPONSE VACCINES, BUT CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY TITERS ELICITED BY MRNA VACCINES ARE ~10-FOLD LOWER THAN TITERS ELICITED BY PROTEIN NANOPARTICLE (NP) VACCINES. THIS IS A CONCERN WITH REGARDS TO THE EMERGENCE OF SARS-COV-2 VARIANTS OF CONCERN (VOCS) THAT ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO VACCINE- INDUCED ANTIBODIES. IN ADDITION, LESS THAN 25% OF THE WORLD POPULATION IS FULLY VACCINATED. THUS, RAPID-RESPONSE VACCINE TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEEDED THAT ELICIT POTENT ANTIBODY RESPONSES WITH A SINGLE INJECTION AND/OR LOWER DOSES, TO ENSURE LASTING PROTECTION AGAINST VOCS, REDUCE COSTS, AND ACCELERATE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION. MOREOVER, PREVENTION OF FUTURE COV PANDEMICS REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIVERSAL COV VACCINE THAT ELICITS CROSS-REACTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES AGAINST A BROAD SPECTRUM OF COV STRAINS BY FOCUSING RESPONSES TO CONSERVED EPITOPES. THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DESIGN AND EVALUATE NEW VACCINE STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE THE POTENCY OF MRNA-BASED RAPID-RESPONSE VACCINES AND FACILITATE UNIVERSAL COV VACCINE DEVELOPMENT. THE PROPOSAL IS BASED ON THE EBR NP TECHNOLOGY, WHICH MODIFIES MEMBRANE PROTEINS SUCH AS COV SPIKE (S) PROTEINS TO SELF-ASSEMBLE INTO VIRUS- RESEMBLING NPS THAT BUD FROM THE CELL SURFACE. NP ASSEMBLY IS INDUCED BY INSERTING A SHORT AMINO ACID SEQUENCE INTO THE CYTOPLASMIC TAIL DESIGNED TO RECRUIT PROTEINS FROM THE ENDOSOMAL SORTING COMPLEX REQUIRED FOR TRANSPORT (ESCRT) PATHWAY. INITIAL STUDIES IN MICE SHOWED THAT LOW-DOSE INJECTIONS OF EBR NPS PRESENTING THE SARS- COV-2 S PROTEIN ELICITED 10-FOLD HIGHER NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY TITERS THAN SOLUBLE S PROTEIN AND PROTEIN-BASED NPS THAT DISPLAYED THE RECEPTOR-BINDING DOMAIN (RBD) OF THE S PROTEIN. THE EBR NP TECHNOLOGY WILL BE APPLIED TO ACCOMPLISH THREE GOALS: I) DESIGN A HYBRID MRNA VACCINE ENCODING THE MODIFIED SARS-COV-2 S-EBR CONSTRUCT THAT WOULD BE EXPRESSED AT THE CELL SURFACE AND SELF-ASSEMBLE INTO VIRUS-RESEMBLING NPS TO ELICIT MORE POTENT ANTIBODY RESPONSES THAN THE APPROVED PFIZER/MODERNA VACCINES, WHILE RETAINING THE MANUFACTURING PROPERTIES AND T-CELL ACTIVATION OF MRNA VACCINES. II) ENGINEER S-EBR NPS TO PACKAGE AND DELIVER S OR S-EBR MRNA VACCINES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO LIPID NPS. THIS DELIVERY APPROACH WOULD ENHANCE MRNA VACCINE POTENCY AS S PROTEINS PRESENTED ON S-EBR NPS INDUCE POTENT ANTIBODY RESPONSES, FACILITATE EFFICIENT INTRACELLULAR DELIVERY, AND TARGET MRNA VACCINES TO TISSUES THAT ARE NATURALLY INFECTED BY SARS-COV-2 TO INDUCE LOCAL IMMUNE RESPONSES. III) DESIGN AND EVALUATE MOSAIC S-EBR NP-BASED UNIVERSAL COV VACCINE CANDIDATES THAT PRESENT FULL-LENGTH MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED S PROTEINS FROM MULTIPLE COV STRAINS TO ELICIT CROSS-REACTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES AGAINST A BROAD SPECTRUM OF COVS AND PROTECT AGAINST FUTURE OUTBREAKS.

FOR EXAMPLE, AUTOIMMUNE LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME (ALPS), A DISORDER IN WHICH T CELLS FAIL TO UNDERGO APOPTOSIS, IS MOST OFTEN CAUSED BY GENETIC DEFECTS IN THE DEATH RECEPTOR FAS OR ITS LIGAND FASL. HOWEVER, MUTATIONS IN CASPASE-8 OR ITS ADAPTOR FADD \u2013 WHICH MEDIATE CELL DEATH DOWNSTREAM OF FAS \u2013 CAUSE A COMBINATION OF ALPS PLUS SEVERE IMMUNODEFICIENCY. SINCE IMMUNODEFICIENCY IS NOT GENERALLY OBSERVED IN PATIENTS WITH FAS OR FASL MUTATIONS, I HYPOTHESIZED THAT FADD-CASPASE-8 MUST HAVE AN APOPTOSIS-INDEPENDENT FUNCTION DOWNSTREAM OF AN IMMUNE RECEPTOR OTHER THAN FAS. INDEED, I RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT ACTIVATION OF MULTIPLE IMMUNE RECEPTORS ELICITS THE CASPASE-8-MEDIATED CLEAVAGE OF NEDD4- BINDING PROTEIN 1 (N4BP1), A NOVEL CYTOKINE SUPPRESSOR. THIS REPRESENTS A CRITICAL POINT OF REGULATION DURING INFLAMMATION. NOTABLY, DELETION OF N4BP1 DOES NOT ORDINARILY AFFECT THE TRIF-DEPENDENT SUBSET OF TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS (TLRS) THAT ACTIVATE CASPASE-8 (E.G., TLR3 AND TLR4). HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRED CYTOKINE PRODUCTION OF CASPASE-8-DEFICIENT MACROPHAGES STIMULATED WITH A TLR4 AGONIST IS RESTORED TO NORMAL BY CO-DELETION OF N4BP1. IN CONTRAST, N4BP1 DELETION LEADS TO EXORBITANT CYTOKINE RESPONSES BY THE TRIF-INDEPENDENT TLRS (E.G., TLR1/2, TLR7 AND TLR9) THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY ACTIVATE CASPASE-8. THUS, N4BP1 CLEAVAGE BY CASPASE-8 INACTIVATES THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY OF INTACT, UN-CLEAVED N4BP1. THESE FINDINGS OFFER A NOVEL MECHANISTIC EXPLANATION FOR IMMUNODEFICIENCY CAUSED BY FADD-CASPASE-8 MUTATIONS, WHEREBY THE INABILITY TO CLEAVE N4BP1 RESULTS IN ITS ABERRANT PERSISTENCE AND CONSTRICTION OF CYTOKINE RESPONSES. LIKE TLR3 AND TLR4 AGONISTS, TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR (TNF) ALSO LEADS TO CASPASE-8 CLEAVAGE OF N4BP1, ENDOWING TNF WITH THE ABILITY TO INACTIVATE N4BP1 AND THEREBY LICENSE CYTOKINE PRODUCTION BY THE TRIF-INDEPENDENT TLRS. THIS LATTER FINDING HIGHLIGHTS A KEY POINT OF MOLECULAR CROSSTALK BETWEEN THE TNF AND TLR SYSTEMS THAT CONVERGES ON CASPASE-8 CLEAVAGE OF N4BP1. IN THE CURRENT PROPOSAL, I HAVE LINKED THE MECHANISM BY WHICH N4BP1 SUPPRESSES CYTOKINE PRODUCTION TO A SERIES OF PROTEINS WITH BOTH PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED AND HERETOFORE UNKNOWN ROLES IN INFLAMMATION. IN AIM 1, I WILL ATTEMPT TO DECIPHER THE MECHANISM BY WHICH N4BP1 CONTROLS THE ACTIVITY OF THIS NOVEL KINASE-DEPENDENT PATHWAY THAT SUPPRESSES INFLAMMATION.

HOWEVER, AT LEAST 50% OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A SUSPECTED GENETIC DISORDER REMAIN UNDIAGNOSED AFTER A COMPLETE CLINICAL EVALUATION, WHICH CAN TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE. THERE ARE TWO MAJOR TECHNICAL REASONS FOR THIS LOW SOLVE RATE. FIRST, STRUCTURAL VARIANTS SUCH AS LARGE DELETIONS, INSERTIONS, INVERSIONS, AND REPEAT EXPANSIONS ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF UNSOLVED CASES, BUT THEY ARE CHALLENGING TO ANALYZE USING TRADITIONAL SHORT-READ SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES. SECOND, MANY VARIANTS LIE IN RECENTLY DUPLICATED GENOMIC REGIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE USING SHORT-READ SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES. RECENTLY, IT HAS BECOME ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE TO PURSUE WHOLE-GENOME LONG-READ SEQUENCING (LRS) OF HUMAN GENOMES WITH SUFFICIENT COVERAGE TO ANALYZE THESE COMPLEX GENOMIC REGIONS. THIS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE THE INCREMENTAL DIAGNOSTIC RATE OF LRS OVER CURRENT TESTING APPROACHES AND APPLY LRS TECHNOLOGY TO A LARGE COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH UNSOLVED GENETIC DISORDERS. MOREOVER, LRS IS UNIQUE IN THAT AS A SINGLE TEST IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REPLACE NEARLY ALL EXISTING CLINICAL GENETIC TESTING (MICROARRAY, EXOME, METHYLATION STUDIES), MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO PERFORM A COMPLETE CLINICAL GENETIC EVALUATION IN DAYS TO WEEKS USING A SINGLE DATASET. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR THE CLINICAL ADOPTION OF LONG-READ DNA AND RNA SEQUENCING BY SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH SUSPECTED OR UNSOLVED GENETIC DISORDERS. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, LRS WILL BE PERFORMED ON 50 CRITICALLY ILL NEONATES AND THEIR PARENTS WHO HAD NONDIAGNOSTIC TRIO SHORT-READ WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING (WGS) AND 25 TRIOS FROM THE SAME COHORT WHO HAD DIAGNOSTIC WGS (AIM 1).

TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, I WILL DEVELOP AN IMAGING PLATFORM THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURE THE 3D STRUCTURE OF DNA TOGETHER WITH THE RNA EXPRESSION OF THE REGULATED GENES AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH KEY STRUCTURAL PROTEINS (AIM 1).

THE IMPORTANCE OF OPTIMIZING CANCER-DIRECTED AND SUPPORTIVE THERAPIES TO MINIMIZE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF RADIATION AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED. AMONG THE MANY ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY CANCER TREATMENT IS THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE ENGAGING IN PLEASURABLE SEXUAL BEHAVIORS, AN ESSENTIAL HUMAN FUNCTION THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN, AND A CLINICAL PROBLEM LONG OVERLOOKED IN FEMALE CANCER SURVIVORS. CURRENT CLASSIFICATIONS OF TOXICITY AND NORMAL TISSUES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY ACCOUNT ONLY POORLY FOR THE ANATOMY AND CRITICAL FUNCTION OF FEMALE ERECTILE TISSUES (AROUSAL AND ORGASM) WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PATIENTS' CAPACITIES TO ENGAGE IN PLEASURABLE SEXUAL BEHAVIORS. IN ADDITION, IT HAS YET TO BE TESTED WHETHER OBSERVED ALTERATIONS OF VAGINAL AND STOOL MICROBIOME ECOLOGY AFTER RADIOTHERAPY CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO RADIATION-INDUCED VAGINAL TOXICITY AND SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION, AS HAS BEEN EXPLORED RECENTLY IN THE CONTEXT OF RADIATION-INDUCED GASTROINTESTINAL TOXICITY.

NON-WHITE AMERICANS MAKE UP 40% OF THE POPULATION AND FACE FURTHER CHALLENGES, BECAUSE DISEASE CAN APPEAR MORE SUBTLY IN PIGMENTED SKIN, LEADING TO SYSTEMATIC UNDERDIAGNOSIS AND UNDERTREATMENT. SKIN BIOPSY IS MORE OBJECTIVE BUT NOT ALL PATIENTS, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN, TOLERATE INVASIVE PROCEDURES, AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT OVERUTILIZATION AND LOW DIAGNOSTIC YIELD OF BIOPSIES. THUS THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR OBJECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN QUANTITATIVELY ASSESS CUTANEOUS INFLAMMATION AND NEOPLASMS ACROSS DIVERSE SKIN TYPES, AND THAT CAN PROVIDE NONINVASIVE ALTERNATIVES TO SKIN BIOPSY. MACROSCOPIC OPTICAL IMAGING MODALITIES MAY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, BUT MOSTLY DEPEND ON SILICON(SI)-BASED PHOTODETECTORS, WHICH CONSTRAINS WHAT THESE DEVICES CAN MEASURE BECAUSE IN THE RANGE WHERE SI-BASED DETECTORS ARE MOST SENSITIVE (400-950 NM), MELANIN AND HEMOGLOBIN ARE THE DOMINANT CHROMOPHORES, WHILE LIPID AND WATER ARE ESSENTIALLY INVISIBLE. WITH RESPECT TO MICROSCOPIC OPTICAL IMAGING MODALITIES, REFLECTANCE CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY (RCM) PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE TO BIOPSY. HOWEVER, CONVENTIONAL RCM IS LIMITED TO DEPTHS OF 200-350 \u039cM, AND THEREFORE DEEPER LESION MARGINS MAY BE MISSED AND DISEASE PROCESSES THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE EPIDERMIS ARE INACCESSIBLE. THE SHORT WAVE INFRARED (SWIR) SPECTRAL RANGE (900-1700 NM) EXTENDS BEYOND THE REACH OF SI-BASED DETECTORS, AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASED WATER AND LIPID ABSORPTION, AND DECREASED MELANIN ABSORPTION.

ONE EMERGING MECHANISM OF DEVELOPING SUCH HETEROGENEITY IS THE EVOLUTION OF MICROENVIRONMENTAL NICHES WITHIN TUMORS THAT SUPPORT A CANCER STEM CELL (CSC) STATE. CSCS ARE DEFINED BY THEIR FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES SUCH AS LONG-TERM SELF- RENEWAL, THE CAPACITY TO GIVE RISE TO A RANGE OF DIFFERENTIATED CELL TYPES, AND ENHANCED TUMOR-FORMING ABILITY.

THIS IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS GIVEN THE STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN READING COMPREHENSION (RC) ABILITY AND BROAD HEALTH AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES, INCLUDING MORE THAN 300 BILLION ANNUAL ECONOMIC BURDEN RELATED TO LOW LITERACY IN THE US. DESPITE THE PREVALENCE OF LOW RC, META-ANALYSES OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS AND NATIONAL STATISTICS IN THE US REVEAL NO SIGNIFICANT RC GAINS OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS. THIS IS DUE IN PART TO LIMITATIONS OF BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES TO CHARACTERIZE THE COMPLEX PROCESSES INVOLVED IN RC. BRAIN RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED MORE GRANULAR MECHANISMS OF RC/RC ABILITY. THIS INCLUDES MY OWN RESEARCH THAT HAS IDENTIFIED BRAIN PATHWAYS THAT PROMOTE BEHAVIORAL RESILIENCE IN RC DISORDERS, I.E. BRAIN PATHWAYS THAT MITIGATE SEVERE SYMPTOMS IN RC DISORDERS. HOWEVER, BRAIN RESEARCH HAS THUS FAR BEEN UNABLE TO APPLY BRAIN NETWORK SCIENCE FOR A DIRECT, CLINICAL BENEFIT. THE GOAL OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR BRAIN-BASED RC INTERVENTIONS BY INTEGRATING RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN TWO SEPARATE FIELDS: BRAIN NETWORK SCIENCE OF RC RESILIENCE AND NON-INVASIVE BRAIN NETWORK STIMULATION. I HAVE ESTABLISHED A LINE OF RESEARCH THAT USES FUNCTIONAL MRI AND EEG TO CHARACTERIZE BRAIN SIGNATURES OF RC ABILITY AND RESILIENCE. I HAVE FOUND THAT CROSS-NETWORK COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE READING- LANGUAGE BRAIN NETWORK (RLN) AND A BRAIN NETWORK RESPONSIBLE FOR GOAL-ORIENTED THOUGHT (THE COGNITIVE CONTROL NETWORK; CCN) IS MORE PREDICTIVE OF RC OUTCOMES THAN WITHIN-NETWORK COMMUNICATION (E.G. RLN ALONE). THESE RESULTS MIRROR FINDINGS IN A RANGE OF DISORDERS THAT CONNECT THE CCN TO RESILIENCE AND PROVIDE A COMPELLING TARGET FOR BRAIN INTERVENTION. IN A SEPARATE FIELD, BRAIN STIMULATION HAS ALSO SEEN A RECENT BREAKTHROUGH: USING EEG-GUIDED, INDIVIDUALLY-TUNED STIMULATION OF FULL NETWORKS RESULTS IN RECOVERED MEMORY CAPACITY IN OLDER ADULTS THAT OUTLASTS STIMULATION, BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED TO OTHER DOMAINS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RECENT ADVANCES IN RC BRAIN NETWORK SCIENCE AND NON-INVASIVE BRAIN STIMULATION TO DEVELOP A SAFE, BRAIN-BASED RC INTERVENTION PROTOCOL. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT PROMOTION OF CROSS-NETWORK CONNECTIVITY WILL RESULT IN INCREASED RC ABILITY PARTICULARLY IN LOW RC GROUPS. IN THIS PROJECT, I WILL DETERMINE: THE CAUSAL EFFECTS OF CROSS- VS WITHIN-NETWORK STIMULATION ON READERS' RC ABILITY AND BRAIN METRICS (AIM 1); HOW STIMULATION OUTCOMES INTERACT WITH INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE RC ABILITY/BRAIN METRICS (AIM 2); AND THE EFFICACY OF STIMULATION BEYOND BEHAVIORAL TRAINING EFFECTS (AIM 3). N = 225 ADULTS WITH GOOD AND POOR RC ABILITY WILL BE TESTED ACROSS 3 VISITS: A PRE-INTERVENTION VISIT FOR BASELINE BEHAVIOR AND FMRI/EEG METRICS; A STIMULATION VISITS (RANDOMIZED/SUBJECT FOR CROSS- VS. WITHIN-NETWORK TARGETS) WITH BEHAVIOR AND FMRI/EEG METRICS, AND A POST-INTERVENTION VISIT TO MEASURE PROLONGED BEHAVIOR AND FMRI/EEG EFFECTS. BEFORE STIMULATION, SUBJECTS WILL RECEIVE A SHORT RC INTERVENTION.

HOWEVER, IT HAS NO EFFECT ON THE HIV RESERVOIR, A SMALL POOL OF LATENTLY INFECTED CELLS THAT REKINDLES INFECTION UPON TREATMENT INTERRUPTION. DUE TO THE PERSISTENCE OF THIS RESERVOIR, ART MUST BE CONTINUED INDEFINITELY, REQUIRING PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS TO DELIVER MEDICATIONS TO ALL 38 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV FOR LIFE. THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM HAS THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF HELPING DEVELOP NEW THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES TO ELIMINATE OR CONTROL THE HIV RESERVOIR, LEADING TO A DRUG-FREE REMISSION. THE PROLIFERATION OF INFECTED CELLS IS A MAJOR MECHANISM OF HIV PERSISTENCE, AS IT RESULTS IN EXPANDED CD4+ T CELL CLONES THAT CARRY PROVIRAL DNA. RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSES CONTRIBUTE LARGELY TO THIS PHENOMENON. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF CHRONIC ANTIGENS IN DETERMINING THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF THE CLONES THAT CONSTITUTE THE HIV RESERVOIR. THE UNDERLYING CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES IMPOSE SELECTIVE PRESSURE ON HIV-INFECTED CELLS. THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROJECT IS THAT, IF CLONAL EXPANSION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR MECHANISMS OF HIV PERSISTENCE, TARGETING THIS PROCESS WILL REDUCE THE RESERVOIR SIZE AND ACCELERATE ITS DECAY. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY PURSUING THREE SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ANTIGENS ON HIV LATENCY REVERSAL; 2) IDENTIFY THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXPANSION AND MAINTENANCE OF HIV-INFECTED, ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CLONES; AND 3) DETERMINE THE ROLE OF CHRONIC ANTIGENS FROM COMMENSAL PATHOGENS IN DRIVING RESERVOIR PERSISTENCE. UNDER THE FIRST AIM, CD4+ T CELLS REACTIVE TO CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV, THE VIRUS RESPONSIBLE FOR A COMMON CHRONIC INFECTION) WILL BE ISOLATED FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH HIV AND EXPANDED EX VIVO. UPON STIMULATION OF T CELLS WITH COGNATE CMV ANTIGENS, HIV LATENCY WILL BE STUDIED AT THE SINGLE-CELL LEVEL AND COMPARED TO NON-SPECIFIC MAXIMAL T CELL STIMULATION, COMMONLY USED TO REVERSE LATENCY IN VITRO. FOR THE SECOND AIM, CMV-RESPONSIVE CLONES HARBORING HIV WILL BE TRACKED LONGITUDINALLY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH CMV REPLICATION AROUND THE TIME OF ART INTRODUCTION, IN THE EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND THE EVENTS UNDERLYING THEIR EXPANSION. FOR THE THIRD AIM, CANDIDA ALBICANS, A PATHOGENIC COMMENSAL YEAST THAT PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN DRIVING ANTIFUNGAL IMMUNE RESPONSES, WILL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE WHETHER CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO COMMENSAL MICROBES SHAPES THE REPERTOIRE OF CD4+ T CELLS, INCLUDING THOSE PART OF THE HIV RESERVOIR. THE RESEARCH PROPOSED IN THIS APPLICATION IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE, COMPARED TO THE STATUS QUO, IT FOCUSES ON PHYSIOLOGICAL T CELL STIMULATION AND UBIQUITOUS IMMUNE RESPONSES TO STUDY LATENCY REVERSAL AND HIV DYNAMICS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY AND HIV PERSISTENCE, AND WILL PROVIDE NEW INSIGHT ON HOW TO TARGET A MAJOR MECHANISM OF HIV RESERVOIR MAINTENANCE.

WHILE COMPETITIVE SPORT OFFERS MANY BENEFITS, IT ALSO POSES UNDERAPPRECIATED RISKS TO LONG-TERM HEALTH. COMPETITIVE SPORT PROFOUNDLY INCREASES RISK FOR INJURY (E.G., KNEE INJURY) AND MAY POSITION ATHLETES FOR EARLY ONSET OF CHRONIC DISEASES (E.G., OSTEOARTHRITIS), CHRONIC PAIN, POOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND DISABILITY. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE INDICATES FORMER ATHLETES IN MID-LIFE (MEAN AGE 53) PERFORM WORSE ON FUNCTIONAL TESTS THAN NON-ATHLETE PEERS, BUT DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR PRIOR INJURY STATUS. QUANTIFYING FUNCTION IN FORMER ATHLETES WITH AND WITHOUT A PRIOR INJURY AND NON-ATHLETE CONTROLS IS THEREFORE CRITICAL TO INFORMING TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AND ULTIMATELY INCREASING HEALTHSPANS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. ONE MODIFIABLE FACTOR THAT MAY EXPLAIN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SPORTS PARTICIPATION AND POOR LONG-TERM HEALTH IS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) PATTERNS INCLUDING PROLONGED SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR (SB). EVEN AMONG ADULTS WHO MEET RECOMMENDED PA GUIDELINES, SB IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH A HOST OF POOR OUTCOMES INCLUDING CHRONIC DISEASE AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY. CURRENT MALE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SEDENTARY OUTSIDE THEIR PRACTICE TIMES THAN NON-ATHLETES, BUT WHETHER THIS HARMFUL PATTERN OF SB ALSO EXISTS IN AMATEUR (E.G., HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGIATE) OR FEMALE ATHLETES OR PERSISTS IN FORMER ATHLETES IS UNKNOWN. THE LONG-TERM RESEARCH GOAL IS TO IMPROVE MUSCULOSKELETAL, CARDIOMETABOLIC, AND GENERAL HEALTH AND FUNCTION ACROSS THE LIFESPAN OF MALE AND FEMALE FORMER ATHLETES, EMPHASIZING EARLY BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS THAT PREVENT THIS UNDERREPRESENTED AND AT-RISK POPULATION FROM DEVELOPING CHRONIC DISEASES BY MID-LIFE. THE OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT FORMER ATHLETES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH A PRIOR INJURY, WILL HAVE POORER FUNCTION AND HEALTH IN MID-LIFE AND THAT CURRENT AND FORMER ATHLETES WILL ENGAGE IN GREATER OVERALL AND LONGER BOUTS OF SB COMPARED TO MATCHED NON-ATHLETES.

AIM 2 WILL COMPARE SB AND PA PATTERNS IN CURRENT (AGE 18-25) AND MID-LIFE FORMER ATHLETES TO MATCHED NON-ATHLETE CONTROLS.

WORLDWIDE, THEY ACCOUNT FOR 17 MILLION YEARS LIVED WITH DISABILITY (YLDS) AND APPROXIMATELY 17,000 DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (DALYS), BECOMING THE MOST COMMON NON- COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCDS). DESPITE SUCCESSFUL ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART), ORAL DISEASES REMAIN MORE PREVALENT IN PWH THAN THOSE WITHOUT HIV. OUR PROPOSAL ENTITLED \u201cTABASAMU: A MULTIDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION ON BUILDING UP RESEARCH CAPACITY IN ORAL HEALTH AND HIV/AIDS\u201d PREPARES THE PATH FOR A FUTURE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM IN KENYA INVOLVING THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (UW, SEATTLE, USA), THE UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI (UON), AND THE KENYATTA NATIONAL HOSPITAL (KNH) (NAIROBI, KENYA). THE TABASAMU (SMILE IN SWAHILI) APPLICATION IS BUILT UPON THE SUCCESSES OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\u2019S (NIH) LONG-TERM FUNDING IN THE REGION. OUR OBJECTIVES ARE TO: 1) FINALIZE THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR TABASAMU NETWORK. BY BUILDING UPON THE LONG HISTORY OF COLLABORATION AMONG THE UW, UON, AND KNH, WE WILL SOLIDIFY EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CURRENT RESEARCHERS AND STAKEHOLDERS AND ENGAGE NEW ONES SO AS TO CREATE AN ALLIANCE FOR INTEGRATING ORAL HEALTH WITHIN THEIR CURRENT HIV RESEARCH AND POLICY STRUCTURES. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE TRAINING EFFORTS OUGHT TO BE DECENTRALIZED, WE PLAN TO CONDUCT A STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS IN NAIROBI, MOMBASA AND KISUMU, THE CITIES WITH THE LARGEST HIV PREVALENCE IN KENYA, IN ORDER TO: A) FACILITATE CONSENSUS AMONG OUR KENYAN COLLABORATORS ON THE PERCEIVED NEEDS AND PRIORITIES THAT OUR FUTURE D43 GRANT ON ORAL HEALTH WILL ADDRESS, B) UNDERSTAND CURRENT KENYAN HIV RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAMS AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ORAL HEALTH COLLABORATION THAT WILL STRENGTH OUR TRAINING GRANT APPLICATION, AND C) DESIGN A NETWORK MAP WITH IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL MENTORS WITH ENOUGH ACTIVE RESEARCH AGENDAS FOR STUDY TRAINEES\u2019 PROJECTS. 2) IDENTIFY A PIONEER GENERATION OF ORAL HEALTH RESEARCHERS. BY ENGAGING COUNTY GOVERNMENTS AND UTILIZING OUR TABASAMU NETWORK IN NAIROBI, MOMBASA, AND KISUMU WE WILL IDENTIFY POTENTIAL HIGH CALIBER TRAINEES FOR THE FUTURE D43 PROGRAM. THROUGH FOCUS GROUPS/VIDEO CONFERENCES AMONG POSSIBLE TRAINEES, WE WILL GATHER DATA ON INTEREST, FEASIBILITY, LOGISTICS, FINANCIAL BURDEN, AND POSSIBLE CHALLENGES THAT FUTURE TRAINEES MIGHT ENCOUNTER AT THEIR HOME INSTITUTIONS WHILE TAKING TIME OFF FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. BECAUSE COMMUNICATION AMONG THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL ENHANCE OUR POOL OF RESEARCHERS, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A FUNCTIONAL SOCIAL MEDIA GROUP THAT WILL BOOST INTERACTION AND PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR ENGAGING IN NIH ACTIVITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE FELLOWS. 3) ORGANIZE, DEVELOP, AND FINALIZE OUR D43 GRANT APPLICATION. THROUGH THIS PLANNING GRANT, WE WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO REACH OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS AND KEY INVESTIGATORS AT THEIR WORK SITES, THEREFORE IDENTIFYING ORAL HEALTH CHAMPIONS WHO WILL PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN DEFINING AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT A FUTURE HIV RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM IN ORAL HEALTH.

CUSTOMIZED CURRICULA BASED ON EACH TRAINEE\u2019S INDIVIDUALIZED DEVELOPMENT PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. TRAINEES WILL HAVE A SHORT-TERM (6 MONTHS) TRAINING EXPERIENCE IN US LABORATORIES DIRECTED BY FACULTY MENTORS WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN EPIDEMIOLOGY, PERIODONTOLOGY, MICROBIOME, BIOINFORMATICS, IMMUNOLOGY AND CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASE, WHILE COMPLETING THEIR RESEARCH DEGREE OR POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES. THIS PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A RIGOROUS INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENTIFIC TRAINING EXPERIENCE AND CREATE A POOL OF CANDIDATES WITH POTENTIAL TO JOIN THE FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO ADDRESS A NEED FOR ORAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND INTERVENTIONS IN JAMAICA.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "NY", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "f94a8263-c1eb-718b-03c5-bb8a878692fd-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_D43DE033474_7529"}, {"internal_id": 147541154, "Award ID": "D43DE032294", "Award Amount": 430273.0, "Award Type": "PROJECT GRANT (B)", "Base Obligation Date": "2022-04-01", "CFDA Number": "93.121", "Description": "CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH TRAINING IN ORAL HEALTH FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA - ABSTRACT ORAL DISEASES POSE A MAJOR HEALTH CHALLENGE GLOBALLY AND AFFECT PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIME. THESE DISEASES SHARE COMMON RISK FACTORS WITH OTHER MAJOR CHRONIC NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND DISORDERS (NCDS). THE WELL-ESTABLISHED ORAL-SYSTEMIC HEALTH CONNECTIONS ALSO INDICATE THAT PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ORAL DISEASES IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN MAINTAINING GOOD GENERAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. YET, DUE TO THE LACK OF PERSONNEL, ACCESS TO TRAINING, KNOWLEDGE OF RESEARCH METHODS, AND FUNDING, ORAL HEALTH CARE AND RESEARCH IS STILL LIMITED IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. THE LARGE DIVERSITIES IN THE GEOGRAPHY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND CULTURES IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR LOCALLY RELEVANT RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY RISK FACTORS AND ORAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN EACH COUNTRY. THE GOAL OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO SUSTAINABLY STRENGTHEN THE ORAL HEALTH RESEARCH CAPACITY AMONG LMICS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA BY ESTABLISHING A TRAINING HUB IN THAILAND AND FOSTERING A NETWORK OF REGIONAL RESEARCHERS. THE PLAN PROPOSES TO BUILD UPON AND EXPAND TWO ESTABLISHED TRAINING PROGRAMS \u201cCLINICAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND BEHAVIORAL ORAL HEALTH RESEARCH TRAINING FOR THAILAND\u201d (D43TW007768 AND D43TW009071, PI: DEROUEN), WHICH HAVE BEEN COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (UW) AND AFFILIATED FACULTIES OF DENTISTRY AT KHON KAEN UNIVERSITY (KKU) AND THAMMASAT UNIVERSITY (TU) IN THAILAND. DR. WARANUCH PITIPHAT, DEAN OF KKU FACULTY OF DENTISTRY, THE DIRECTOR OF THIS PROGRAM (PD) WAS A MAJOR COLLABORATOR AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE PREVIOUS TRAINING PROGRAMS. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL ALSO INCLUDE 4 MAJOR COLLABORATING INSTITUTIONS: UNIVERSITY OF INDONESIA, UNIVERSITY OF MALAYA, UNIVERSITY OF PHILIPPINES MANILA, AND CAN THO UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE AND PHARMACY IN VIETNAM. FIVE LEVELS OF TRAINING ARE BEING PROPOSED: (1) SHORT-TERM TRAINING. A SERIES OF 5-DAY WORKSHOPS ON CLINICAL RESEARCH METHODS, CONDUCTED IN THAILAND OR OTHER SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES ANNUALLY (N=120 TOTAL); (2) INTERMEDIATE-TERM TRAINING. AN 8-WEEK PROGRAM AT THE UW COHO INSTITUTE IN CLINICAL RESEARCH METHODS IN SEATTLE. THE TRAINEES WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM ONLINE FOR 6 WEEKS AND IN SEATTLE FOR 2 WEEKS (N=18 TOTAL); (3) MEDIUM-TERM TRAINING. A SHORT COURSE TRAINING IN RESEARCH METHODOLOGY & BIOSTATISTICS OFFERED ANNUALLY AT KKU IN THAILAND. THIS IS AN INTENSIVE PROGRAM IN WHICH THE TRAINEES WILL TAKE DIDACTIC COURSES AND DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH PROPOSAL AT THE END OF THE 4-MONTH COURSE (N=20 TOTAL). MEDIUM-TERM TRAINEES CAN APPLY FOR THE NEXT LEVEL OF TRAINING; (4) NON-DEGREE RESEARCH TRAINING. A RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM ALLOWS THE TRAINEES TO DO RESEARCH IN HOME COUNTRY UNDER GUIDANCE OF A LOCAL MENTOR AS WELL AS UW AND THAI FACULTY (N=16 TOTAL); (5) LONG-TERM TRAINING. THE PROGRAM WILL SUPPORT FIVE DENTISTS FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA TO PURSUE PHD IN ORAL SCIENCES AT THE TWO THAI UNIVERSITIES. AFTER COMPLETING 1-YEAR COURSEWORK IN THAILAND, PHD STUDENTS WILL ATTEND THE SUMMER INSTITUTE IN SEATTLE AND WORK WITH UW MENTORS TO DEVELOP A DISSERTATION RESEARCH PROPOSAL TO BE CARRIED OUT IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "THA", "Place of Performance State Code": null, "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "6b232061-bd7d-7fba-d141-72b89be89463-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_D43DE032294_7529"}, {"internal_id": 146399977, "Award ID": "OT2OD032100", "Award Amount": 5481895.0, "Award Type": "DIRECT PAYMENT FOR SPECIFIED USE, AS A SUBSIDY OR OTHER NON-REIMBURSABLE DIRECT FINANCIAL AID (C)", "Base Obligation Date": "2021-09-24", "CFDA Number": "93.879", "Description": "NIH STRIDES - AZURE AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES AND TRAINING.", "Place of Performance Country Code": "USA", "Place of Performance State Code": "TX", "COVID-19 Obligations": null, "Infrastructure Obligations": null, "recipient_id": "3612de0a-9635-3846-a5a1-7f555fba52df-C", "generated_internal_id": "ASST_NON_OT2OD032100_7529"}]
