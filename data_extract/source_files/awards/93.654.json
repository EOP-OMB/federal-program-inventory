BETWEEN 2016 AND 2021, COWLITZ TRIBAL TREATMENT HAS SEEN AN INCREASE IN ALCOHOL USE BY 9.1%, OPIATE USE UP BY 6.6%, AND METHAMPHETAMINE USE BY 40%. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SUICIDE DEATH RATES HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN WASHINGTON STATE. ACCORDING TO A 2019 ANALYSIS BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL, THE U.S. SUICIDE RATE IS UP 33 PERCENT SINCE 1999. THE RATE IS LARGER FOR AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVES (AI/AN) WOMEN AND MEN. THE AI/AN SUICIDE RATE FOR THAT PERIOD INCREASED BY 105 PERCENT. THERE IS A DISPARITY IN BOTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SUICIDE DEATH RATES IN AI/AN POPULATIONS. COWLITZ TRIBAL TREATMENT IS ADDRESSING THIS HEALTH CRISIS WITH THE COWLITZ SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION TREATMENT, AND AFTERCARE (SAPTA) CONNECT PROJECT.  TWO OF THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF SUICIDE RISK ARE MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. COWLITZ TRIBAL TREATMENT UTILIZES CULTURAL WELLNESS TRADITIONS, SUD, AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR SUICIDAL IDEATION. THE WELLNESS-CENTERED INSTRUCTIONS BRING TEACHINGS TO OUR CLIENTS WHO DESIRE TO BEGIN A LIFE OF RECOVERY.  SUBSTANCES USE AND SUICIDAL IDEATION ROB INDIVIDUALS OF THEIR HOPE, IDENTITY, AND CONNECTION. PARTICIPATING IN HEALTHY ACTIVITIES WITH CULTURAL COMPONENTS ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO DEVELOP A SENSE OF PURPOSE. OUR COWLITZ SAPTA CONNECT PROJECT WILL REDUCE SUICIDAL IDEATION AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES\u2019 SUICIDES AND ACCIDENTAL SUICIDES. WE WILL SHOW THAT ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE WILL INCREASE THE SUCCESS RATE OF TREATMENT COMPLETIONS AND RETENTION.  THROUGH IMPLEMENTING CONSISTENT CULTURAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN OUR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAM, CLIENTS WILL HAVE A MORE VITAL PURPOSE AND BETTER OUTCOMES IN EARLY RECOVERY. FUSING TRADITIONAL WELLNESS ACTIVITIES INTO OUR PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND AFTERCARE GROUPS, OUR CLIENTS WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ACTIVITIES INTO THEIR RECOVERY JOURNEY THAT FILLS THE VOID WHERE SUBSTANCES OR SUICIDAL THOUGHTS LINGER.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO STRATEGICALLY ADDRESS THE SUBJECT OF SUICIDE AND ITS MANY COMPLEXITIES, BUILDING ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE METHAMPHETAMINE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION INITIATIVE (MSPI) AND RELATED SYSTEM BUILDING TO GROW COAST SALISH-SPECIFIC PREVENTION, EARLY INTERVENTION, CRISIS INTERVENTION, AND POSTVENTION RESPONSE.

THE LEAD ENTITY, KCC/PTHA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE TO THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY. THE KCC DIRECTOR, DR. DANELLE REED, IS A PUYALLUP TRIBAL MEMBER WHO IS INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH LOCAL LANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, ATTITUDES, NORMS AND VALUES ABOUT SUICIDE AND APPLIES THAT KNOWLEDGE TO HER PREVENTION STRATEGIES AND OUTREACH. STAFF SELECTED FOR THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A THERAPEUTIC SPACE IN THE SCHOOL TO REDUCE THE PREVALENCE OF SUICIDAL IDEATION, SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, SUICIDE, AND GENERAL ACADEMIC FAILURE AMONG AI/AN ADULTS AND YOUTH RESIDING ON AND NEAR THE PUYALLUP RESERVATION. AT-RISK YOUTH, PRIMARILY INDIVIDUALS AGED UP TO 24, WILL BE IDENTIFIED FOR SERVICES BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT PROCESS.

THE SECOND GOAL IS TO IMPLEMENT A SET OF COORDINATED COAST SALISH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE \"ZERO SUICIDE FRAMEWORK\" AND COMPLEMENTARY EVIDENCE-BASED AND PROMISING PRACTICES THAT BUILD PROSOCIAL LIFE SKILLS, INCLUDING AILS, CAST, MI, QPR, AND SAFETALK. THE THIRD GOAL IS LINKING COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO EARLY YOUTH-AT-RISK INTERVENTION STRATEGIES CONSISTENT WITH GEN-I BEST PRACTICES. UTILIZING THE ZERO SUICIDE MODEL AND OUTCOME MEASURES ALREADY DEVELOPED, WE WILL ADAPT AND ENHANCE CRISIS SUPPORTS FOR THE STUDENTS AT CLS AS WELL AS ACROSS VARIOUS TRIBAL SYSTEM SETTINGS.

GOAL: IMPROVE COMMUNITY WELLNESS, INCLUDING PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH BY REDUCING DEPRESSION, SUICIDAL IDEATION, SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, AND SUICIDES. OBJECTIVE 1: DECREASE SUICIDES ON THE RESERVATION FROM BASELINE TO ZERO BY IMPLEMENTING THE ZERO SUICIDE MODEL BEGINNING APRIL 2022. OBJECTIVE 2: INCREASE RESILIENCY IN THE MESCALERO ON-RESERVATION COMMUNITY MEMBERS BY 5% THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CALENDAR OF TRADITIONAL WORKSHOPS AND EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS THAT FOLLOWS THE APACHE TRADITIONAL CALENDAR BY APRIL 2023. OBJECTIVE 3: DECREASE CHRONIC DEPRESSION AMONG PEOPLE ON THE RESERVATION BY 10% THROUGH COUNSELING, OUTPATIENT TREATMENT, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATURAL HELPERS PROGRAM AT THE MESCALERO SCHOOL BEGINNING APRIL 2022 AND ASSESSED BY APRIL 2023. WE HAVE THREE COMMUNITY-WIDE COALITIONS THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON SUICIDE PREVENTION AT THIS TIME: THE MESCALERO SERVICE PROVIDER\u2019S COALITION; THE MESCALERO SUICIDE PREVENTION COALITION; AND THE MESCALERO YOUTH COALITION. THESE COALITIONS WILL 1) REVIEW ALL DATA; 2) HELP COLLECT DATA; 3)DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN; 4)IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS; 5)RECRUIT PARTICIPANTS; 6)IDENTIFY AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES; 7)HELP TO EVALUATE ALL EFFORTS TO STOP SUICIDE. AN ADOLESCENT AND AN ADULT COUNSELOR WILL BE HIRED TO PROVIDE TREATMENT AND POSTVENTION SERVICES TO AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE WILL USE OUR OUTSIDE EVALUATOR, ANN DEL VECCHIO, PH.D. DBA ALPHA ASSESSMENT ASSOCIATES, LLC TO WORK WITH THE MPP TEAM AND PARTNERS TO DESIGN APPROPRIATE MEASURES AND METHODS TO EVALUATE THE PROCESS AND OUTCOMES FOR THE SASP-SPIP. THE MPP TEAM IS KNOWLEDGEABLE AND SKILLED AT COLLECTING AND USING DATA FOR NEEDS ASSESSMENT, PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EVALUATION. WE WILL WORK WITH DESIGNATED PARTNERS SUCH AS ALBUQUERQUE AREA SOUTHWEST TRIBAL EPI CENTER, THE MESCALERO FIRE AND RESCUE AND MESCALERO COURTS AND POLICE, AS WELL AS WITH MESCALERO IHS, TO COLLECT ANNUAL AND EVERY OTHER YEAR SURVEYS (YOUTH RISK AND RESILIENCY SURVEY AND THE NEW MEXICO COMMUNITY SURVEY NMCS) AND WE WILL COLLECT CRA COMMUNITY READINESS ASSESSMENTS PER OUR USUAL TIMELINE.

THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA PROPOSED FOR THIS PROJECT IS METROPOLITAN PHOENIX LOCATED IN ARIZONA. WITH 22 SOVEREIGN AMERICAN INDIAN (AI) COMMUNITIES AND 15 COUNTIES, THE STATE OF ARIZONA HAS OVER 4 TIMES THE PROPORTION OF AMERICAN INDIANS THAN THE NATION, WITH 5.3% COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL 1.3% (U.S. CENSUS, 2021). THIS INCLUDES MARICOPA COUNTY WHICH HAS OVER 4.4 MILLION PEOPLE AND IS REPORTED AS THE FOURTH MOST POPULOUS COUNTY IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. CENSUS, 2020). IT IS ESTIMATED THERE ARE 154,088 INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE WITHIN MARICOPA COUNTY AND IDENTIFY AS AI/AN (U.S. CENSUS, 2020).

SUICIDE WITHIN NATIVE COMMUNITIES OFTEN STEMS FROM HISTORICAL, CULTURAL, COMMUNITY AND FAMILY DISRUPTIONS.

WITH THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION (SASP) PROGRAM: SUICIDE PREVENTION, INTERVENTION, AND POSTVENTION (SPIP) GRANT, CWOY WOULD ADD TWO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT NAVIGATOR POSITIONS TO THE CURRENT FOUR.

THIS IN TURN HAS IMPACTED EVERY POPULATION WITHIN MBCI (E.G. ELDERS, CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS/YOUTH, AND ADULTS). COVID-19 HAS ALSO HEAVILY IMPACTED TRIBAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS CHOCTAW HEALTH CENTER AND CHOCTAW TRIBAL SCHOOLS.

ENGAGE. FOR EVERY IDENTIFIED PATIENT AT RISK, CREATE A MONITORING AND PREVENTION/TREATMENT PLAN. TO CLARIFY, IN THE 5.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISEASE RATES AND CO-MORBIDITIES FOR TUNICA-BILOXI ARE ELEVATED WHEN COMPARED TO NATIONAL AVERAGES, EXPERIENCING INCREASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISEASE RATES AND CO-MORBIDITIES. ACCORDING TO THE LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, NON-MEDICAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE AMONG TUNICA-BILOXI TRIBAL MEMBERS IS ESTIMATED AT 15.9%; WHILE ILLICIT DRUG USE IS APPROXIMATELY 18.4% FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS LIVING ON THE RESERVATION FOR 2020. THIS GREATLY EXCEEDS THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AS WELL AS THE AVERAGE AMONG AMERICAN INDIANS PER SAMHSA\u2019S 2017 NATIONAL SURVEY ON DRUG USE HEALTH. SIMILARLY, ALCOHOL ABUSE AMONG TUNICA-BILOXI TRIBAL ADULTS IS 22.4% PER THE TUNICA-BILOXI SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND JUST BELOW THE AVERAGE FOR AI/AN POPULATIONS. OTHER TRIBAL SURVEY DATA HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT TUNICA-BILOXI HAS A HIGH PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION, AUTISM, ATTENTION DEFICIT (HYPERACTIVITY) DISORDER, AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. IT IS KNOWN THAT WHEN ONE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISPARITY OCCURS, OTHER DISPARITIES GO UNTREATED. THE 2019 SAMHSA NATIONAL SURVEY ON DRUG USE AND HEALTH, FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY 34.5% OF YOUTH AGED 16 TO 25 THAT WERE DIAGNOSED WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE ALSO HAVE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER THAT WAS NOT TREATED. COLLECTIVELY, THESE MEASURES HIGHLIGHT THE UNIQUE CONSTELLATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR TUNICA-BILOXI CITIZENS.
