Community policing entails developing partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve so they can work collaboratively to resolve problems and build community trust.  It is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of partnerships and problem solving techniques, in order to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, fear of crime, and satisfaction with police services. Community policing is comprised of three key components:

Policy Research and Evaluation Grants,"The goals of this listing are to improve the effectiveness of public policies that reduce poverty, inequality, and their consequences, promote economic mobility and equity, and further develop knowledge of the structural causes of poverty, inequality, and economic insecurity. To that end, the National Research Center on Poverty and Economic Mobility will: (1) develop a fellowship program that will place researchers on site at HHS to work with federal policy, research, and/or program offices, (2) administer a grant program that will make multiple awards to policy researchers to conduct research and analysis to answer high-priority questions related to equity, inclusion, diversity, and access in economic mobility and human services policy and programs, and (3) collaborate with HHS to disseminate actionable findings which are relevant to primarily federal policy and research communities through co-hosted events.",93.239,100004911,"HHS has a long history of supporting research and evaluation of critical and emerging social policy issues associated with the nature, causes, correlates, and consequences of poverty, inequality, income dynamics, individual and family functioning, and child well-being, and translating this research and evaluation into policy insights and action steps. Over the past five decades, HHS has funded Poverty Centers at multiple higher education institutions. HHS-funded Poverty Centers have historically conducted a broad program of research and evaluation; undertaken research coordination across government and academic institutions; identified and mentored emerging scholars; and developed and maintained networks for the dissemination of key policy-relevant results.

Substantively, the Poverty Center(s) funded through this program have informed policy discussions and development through analysis of poverty levels and trends; causes of poverty, inequality, and income instability; relevant national, regional and state economic contexts for families with low and otherwise unstable incomes; and government programs and policies affecting families struggling to make ends meet.

Under the current solicitation, we are seeking to continue many of the historical activities of the Poverty Centers, but with meaningful shifts in emphases, priorities and activities as described below. First, we seek for the National Research Center on Poverty and Economic Mobility to focus on research and shared insights that identify actionable opportunities to achieve equity in economic mobility policy and implementation. This solicitation defines equity as the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to under-served communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Under-served communities are populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of equity. See also Executive Order 13985 Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. Additionally, we expect the National Research Center on Poverty and Economic Mobility funded under this announcement to provide a greater emphasis on providing HHS with in-house data and policy research expertise, administration of research grants that meet the needs of HHS, and disseminating policy-relevant research through co-hosted events. We seek continued active and ongoing coordination and communication between researchers and policy makers, as well as targeted and effective dissemination of policy-focused findings and results. This new cooperative agreement replaces the current grant with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There are no specific projects that must be continued from the current Poverty Center under this new award other than the continued administrative support of a current fellow through Spring 2020 as well as financial and administrative support of a fellow who will start work in the Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research & Evaluation (OPRE) around August 2021.",HHS,"HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF",IMMED OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

To facilitate CEDS, EDA provides Partnership Planning grants to the designated planning organization (e.g., District Organization) serving EDA-designated Economic Development Districts (EDDs) throughout the Nation.  These planning organizations are typically recognized by the State in which they reside as multi-jurisdictional councils of governments, regional commissions, or planning and development centers.  Partnership Planning grants enable planning organizations to manage and coordinate the development and implementation of CEDS.  In addition, EDA provides Partnership Planning grants to Indian Tribes to help organize and assist with the implementation of economic development activities within their areas.  The majority of funding under the Planning program is for Partnership Planning grants for Indian Tribes and EDA-designated EDDs.

The Planning program also helps support planning organizations and other eligible recipients, including District Organizations and Indian Tribes, with Short-Term and State Planning efforts in order to stimulate and guide the creation and/or retention of higher-skill, higher-wage jobs, particularly for the unemployed and underemployed in the Nation’s most economically distressed regions.

 International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) – Fund 1005

IO&P provides voluntary contributions to international organizations and multilateral programs in which the U.S. participates. There is no legal commitment, treaty, or agreement mandating the contributions. Decisions to make the contribution are based solely on the potential foreign policy benefits to be derived. The contributions generally finance core budgets such as operating expenses of individual organizations or programs, although some are directed for specific program activities. Two of the major recipient organizations/programs are the UN Development Program (UNDP) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF). 

Oversight Responsibilities

Both assessed and voluntary contributions are made to international organizations, missions, and programs in which the United States is a member or participant. As a member or participant, U.S. representatives to those organizations have an oversight responsibility for program operations, financial activities, and overall performance of the organizations. Oversight roles are performed through review of external and internal audit reports and other activities. 
 
The United States is usually on the executive council or governing body of international organizations to which it provides assessed contributions. The duties of these governing bodies are spelled out in international organization constitutive documents. Along with the secretariats of the organizations, these executive councils and governing bodies most often perform a “monitoring” role with regard to financing and oversight of programmatic and financial performance, as part of their budgetary and decision-making processes. The governing bodies also provide the context in which an organization’s member states select the organization’s external auditor and otherwise oversee internal and external audit activities at the organization. This approach is often referred to as “the single audit principle” reflecting the fact that the organization’s member states conduct audit activities jointly, including through a single external auditor, which is typically the national audit office (GAO equivalent) of one of the organization’s member",DOS,"STATE, DEPARTMENT OF",

Mental Health Research Grants,"The mission of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.  

In May 2020, NIMH released its new Strategic Plan for Research.  The new Strategic Plan builds on the successes of previous NIMH strategic plans by providing a framework for scientific research and exploration, and addressing new challenges in mental health.

The new Strategic Plan outlines four high-level Goals: 
• Goal 1: Define the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Complex Behaviors
• Goal 2: Examine Mental Illness Trajectories Across the Lifespan
• Goal 3: Strive for Prevention and Cures
• Goal 4: Strengthen the Public Health Impact of NIMH-Supported Research

These four Goals form a broad roadmap for the Institute’s research priorities over the next five years, beginning with the fundamental science of the brain and behavior, and extending through evidence-based services that improve public health outcomes. The Institute’s overall funding strategy is to support a broad spectrum of investigator-initiated research in fundamental science, with increasing use of Institute-solicited initiatives for applied research where public health impact is a short-term measure of success.  

The new Strategic Plan also addresses a number of cross-cutting themes that are relevant to all research supported by NIMH; these themes highlight areas where NIMH-funded science may have the greatest impact, bridge gaps, and offer novel approaches to accelerate advances in mental health research. For example, NIMH values a comprehensive research agenda that takes an inclusive approach that ensures research interests are varied, maintain diverse participation and partnerships, and achieve research goals across multiple timeframes. This includes diverse methodologies, tools, and models; research addressing complex basic, translational, and applied questions; research including both sexes and, as appropriate, genetic background; and, participants from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, and across gender identities, geographical context, socioeconomic status, neurotype, and age – offering the best possible representation, for the broadest number of individuals who may ultimately benefit from these scientific advances.

To accomplish the Goals outlined in the new Strategic Plan, NIMH will support research that aims:

To characterize the genomic, molecular, cellular, and circuit components contributing to brain organization and function; to identify the developmental, functional, and regulatory mechanisms relevant to cognitive, affective, and social domains, across units of analysis; and, to generate and validate novel tools, techniques, and measures to quantify changes in the activity of molecules, cells, circuits, and connectomes. 

To discover gene variants and other genomic elements that contribute to the development of mental illnesses in diverse populations; to advance our understanding of the complex etiology of mental illnesses using molecular epidemiologic approaches that incorporate individual genetic information in large cohorts; to elucidate how human genetic variation affects the coordination of molecular, cellular, and physiological networks supporting higher-order functions and emergent properties of neurobiological systems; and, to develop novel tools and techniques for the analysis of large-scale genetic, multi-omic data as it applies to mental health. 

To utilize connectomic approaches to identify brain networks and circuit components that contribute to various aspects of mental function and dysfunction; to determine through brain-wide analysis how changes in the physiological properties of molecules, cells, and circuits contribute to mental illnesses; to develop molecular, cellular, and circuit-level biomarkers of impaired neural function in humans; and, to develop innovative technologies, – including new imaging, computational, pharmacological, and genetic tools – to interrogate and modulate circuit activity and structure altered in mental illnesses. 

To elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the trajectories of brain development and behavior; and, to characterize the emergence and progression of mental illnesses, and identifying sensitive periods for optimal intervention. 

To determine early risk and protective factors, and related mechanisms, to serve as novel intervention groups; and, to develop reliable and robust biomarkers and assessment tools to predict illness onset, course, and across diverse populations. 

To develop novel interventions using a mechanism-informed, experimental therapeutics approach; and, to develop and implement measurement strategies to facilitate mechanism-based intervention development and testing. 

To investigate personalized intervention strategies across disease progression and development; and, to develop and refine computational approaches and research designs that can be used to inform and test personalized interventions. 

To develop and test approaches for adapting, combining, and sequencing interventions to achieve the greatest impact on the lives and functioning of persons seeking care; to conduct efficient pragmatic trials that employ new tools to rapidly identify, engage, assess, and follow participants in the context of routine care; and, to enhance the practical relevance of effectiveness research via deployment-focused, hybrid, effectiveness-implementation studies. 

To employ assessment platforms within healthcare systems to accurately assess the distribution and determinants of mental illnesses and to inform strategies for improved services; to optimize real-world data collection systems to identify strategies for improving access, quality, effectiveness, and continuity of mental health services; and, to compare alternative financing models to promote effective and efficient care for individuals with serious emotional disturbances and serious mental illnesses. 

To strengthen partnerships with key stakeholders to develop and validate strategies for implementing, sustaining, and continuously improve evidence-based practices; to build models to scale-up evidence-based practices for use in public and private primary care, specialty care and other settings; and, to develop decision-support tools and technologies that increase the effectiveness and continuous improvement of mental health interventions in public and private primary care, specialty care, and other settings. 

To adapt, validate, and scale-up programs currently in use that improve mental health services for underserved populations; to develop and validate service delivery models that provide evidence-based care for individuals throughout the course of mental illness; to develop and validate systems-level strategies using technology and other approaches, to identify, support, and monitor the effectiveness of evidence-based care throughout the course of illness; and, to develop and validate decision-making models that bridge mental health, medical, and other care settings to integrate the appropriate care for people with serious mental illnesses and comorbid medical conditions.",93.242,100019747,"The mission of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.",HHS,"HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF",NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

Which assists the criminal justice community to enforce the law, improve public safety, prevent and reduce crime, and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice.

The objectives of this program are to: 1) support the prosecution of violent crime cold cases, where DNA from a suspect has been identified [suspect(s) may be known or unknown]; and 2) decrease the number of violent crime cold cases awaiting prosecution.

Performance Measure 1: Violent cold cases investigations that resulted in an indictment or charging decision; and, 

Performance Measure 2: Violent cold cases that resulted in suspect identification.",16.036,500000072,"The Prosecuting Cold Cases using DNA program is a competitive grant program that will provide funding to support agencies in the resolution of violent crime cold cases.

Unresolved violent crime cases continue to amass annually. As crimes occur, unresolved crimes accumulate, adding to an expanding caseload for prosecutors and law enforcement. Once the investigation leads to the identification of a suspect, prosecuting agencies may experience an accumulation of cases to be prosecuted due to limited resources. The purpose of this solicitation is to make funding available to prosecuting agencies for projects that will assist in the resolution of the nation’s violent crime cold cases.

For example, an estimated 103,780 of the reported murders in the United States that occurred between 1996 and 2016 remain unresolved.  Clearance rates have trended downward, with just 46 percent of the violent crime cases cleared in 2016, and only 62 percent of the reported murders were cleared.  The violent crime cases not cleared join the number of cold cases from previous years, compounding the cold case crisis in the United States. 

Advances in DNA technologies have substantially increased the successful analysis of aged, degraded, limited, or otherwise compromised evidence. As a result, evidence once thought to be unsuitable for testing or which may have provided inconclusive results in the past may now be successfully analyzed in some instances, thus providing information on potential suspects. BJA’s Prosecuting Cold Cases using DNA program is aimed at providing resources for agencies to prosecute cases where a suspect’s DNA has been identified, decreasing the number of unresolved violent crime cold cases.",DOJ,"JUSTICE, DEPARTMENT OF",OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS

Justice Reinvestment Initiative,"Goal:
Under the enacted appropriations language, the Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI), helps states identify and respond to crime and other public safety problems, explore evidence-based or innovative and cost-saving strategies, and to invest in strategies that can decrease crime and reduce recidivism.

Objective:
The Justice Reinvestment Initiative currently funds several streams of work:  

1) State-based JRI training and technical assistance supports states’ justice system stakeholders and policy leaders as they devise and implement data-driven approaches to reduce crime and recidivism, including operationalizing data results to reduce violent crime and supporting state and local agencies in their efforts to do the same. Under the JRI model, a governmental working group with bipartisan and inter-branch representation analyzes the crime, recidivism, and corrections data, and its associated costs, then develops cost-effective policy and practice options, and implements and measures those changes.

2) Site-based grant awards are made under the “Justice Reinvestment: Reducing Crime by Improving Justice System Performance” grant program, which allows eligible applicants to apply for funding to develop and implement innovative and research-based responses that address a range of criminal justice system problems. Successful applicants are expected to follow the five-step JRI process to meet their objectives: engage stakeholders; analyze data and the current landscape; develop a plan, procedures, and strategies; implement responses; and measure outcomes. 

3. “Justice Counts” is a JRI-funded program that provides resources and support to state and local criminal justice agencies to bolster the use of data in policymaking and operational decision-making. The program employs a collaborative approach to develop consensus-driven metrics, a web-based platform for agencies to share their data in line with those metrics, and other associated tools and resources.  

4. The Corrections Data Analysts program provides correctional agencies with much-needed analytical capacity and resources to enhance their ability to use data to drive decision-making. The program includes the development of national, virtual academies to facilitate the training and continuing educations of correctional data analysts as well as a resident corrections analysts program in which funded researchers and analysts will work closely with state correctional leaders to produce needed analyses.   

5. “The Price of Justice: Rethinking the Consequences of Fines and Fees” program works in partnership with state, local, and tribal agencies to address the use of fines and fees and ensure they are being used in a constitutional and nondiscriminatory way. The purpose of this program is to address common barriers to creating a more equitable justice system by addressing how agencies use and apply fines and fees.

Nursing Research,"Nurses understand that improving health and well-being means addressing people’s needs in multiple settings, contexts, and over the whole life course. Science supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) uses this holistic perspective to improve individual and population health and advance health equity. NINR-supported research promotes health and well-being by addressing needs at multiple levels – individual, family, community, and societal levels – and developing treatment and prevention strategies that are responsive to the reality of people’s lives. Nurses know people, and people trust nurses. Patient and families interact with nurses more than any other clinicians.  Nursing science uses this special relationship to better understand patients, families, and communities and the many factors that influence their health. Nursing science supported by NINR uses this knowledge to develop strategies for improving health and wellness across populations, health care settings, and the lifespan, with an emphasis on achieving health equity. NINR-supported scientists have developed interventions for:  supporting parents of premature infants; promoting HIV prevention in underserved populations; improving transitional care leading to better outcomes and cost-savings; and helping inner-city children manage asthma. Nursing science transcends the boundaries of disease and research disciplines to better understand the experiences of individuals and families living with illness and to develop personalized approaches that maximize health and well-being for individuals at all stages of life, across diverse populations and settings. NINR-supported science uses nursing science’s unique, patient and community-focused perspective and wide reach across clinical and community settings to advance our understanding of the social determinants of health: those factors that are at the root of the inequities that we see, such as food insecurity and access to healthcare. NINR research efforts in wellness investigate the key biological, behavioral, and social factors that promote long-term health and healthy behaviors and prevent the development of illness across health conditions, settings, and the lifespan. Research in wellness is also focused on developing and testing culturally appropriate interventions to promote health and prevent illness in minority and underserved groups. NINR also supports science to assist individuals, families, and health care professionals in managing advanced, serious illness, and planning for end-of-life decisions. In addition, NINR promotes technological advancements that address a range of health care challenges and facilitate the delivery of real-time personalized information to individuals and families, health care providers, and communities. Finally, NINR has a longstanding and continuing commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists: those individuals and team members who will carry the field of nursing science into the future. In order to prepare an innovative, diverse, and talented next generation of nurse scientists, NINR supports a variety of training opportunities for scientists and trainees at all career levels, particularly those at an early career stage who are so critical to sustaining the future of innovative research and high quality health care.",93.361,100019747,,HHS,"HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF",NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

Wild Horse and Burro Resource Management,"The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages and protects wild horses and burros on 26.9 million acres of public lands across ten western states as part of its mission to administer public lands for multiple uses. The Wild Horse and Burro Program's goal is to manage healthy wild horses and burros on healthy public rangelands. The BLM created the Wild Horse and Burro Program to implement the Wild-Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act, passed by Congress in 1971. Broadly, the law declares wild horses and burros to be “living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West” and stipulates that the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service have the responsibility to manage and protect herds in their respective jurisdictions within areas where wild horses and burros were found roaming in 1971. The Wild Horse and Burro Program consists of two main branches: (1) On-Range management of wild horses and burros, and (2) Off-Range management and care of wild horses and burros. The goal of the On-Range program is to manage for healthy wild horse and burro populations and to maintain a thriving natural ecological balance with other resources and land uses. The Off-Range management goal is to ensure the health and welfare of wild horses and burros that were removed from public lands under BLM care, to place animals into private care through adoptions, sales, and transfers, to conduct compliance inspections of adopted animals and to build partnerships and relationships with external organizations.

Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR),"The objectives of the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) Program are defined in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) is the protection of public health, safety, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal mining practices; the restoration of land and water resources and the environment that have been degraded by the adverse effects of coal mining practices, the protection of public health and safety from adverse effects of coal mining practices, the restoration of land and water resources and the environment that have been degraded by the adverse effects of coal mining practices and emergency restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of adverse effects of coal mining practices, on eligible lands. 

The objectives of the Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization (AMLER) Program are to develop eligible projects that demonstrate a nexus with AML land and water reclamation, and economic and community development. The AMLER Program is an opportunity for local communities and States/Tribes to return impacted areas to productive reuse, which should be defined by the States/Tribes in cooperation with local communities, to achieve the economic and community development goals identified for the community and/or region.  

The objective of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) Program is to address coal AML related problems including coal AML emergencies, physical hazards resulting from legacy coal mining that pose a threat to public health, safety, and the environment (including acid mine drainage), and water supply that has been adversely affected by legacy coal mining.  In addition, the BIL encourages States and Tribes to prioritize projects that provide employment for current and former employees of the coal industry.",15.252,100114291,"AML: Grants are awarded to eligible coal-producing States and Tribes to support the operation of an approved State or Tribal AML reclamation program.  Approved programs use grant funds for the restoration of eligible lands and waters mined and abandoned or left inadequately restored.  Most of the lands and water eligible for reclamation under this authority are those which were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or other Federal laws.  A limited number of legacy sites mined after August 3, 1977, and abandoned before November 5, 1990, for which the surety bonds responsible for the reclamation of the site became insolvent.  

 

AMLER: State and Tribal AML Programs, in consultation with State, Tribal, and local economic/community development authorities, will develop eligible projects that demonstrate a nexus with AML land and water reclamation, and economic and community development.  The AMLER Program is an opportunity for local communities and States and Tribes to return impacted areas to productive reuse, which should be defined by the States and Tribes in cooperation with local communities.  AMLER grants are expected to be used to achieve the economic and community development goals identified by the community and/or region. 

 

BIL:  BIL AML grants will be distributed to eligible State and Tribal AML Programs for use to abate and eliminate physical hazards to public health, safety, and the environment in a timely manner, which will support local communities in achieving their priorities and needs through collaboration and consensus-building for local projects.  By BIL provisions encouraging State and Tribal AML Programs to prioritize projects that employ current and former employees of the coal industry, BIL AML grants will benefit all who live and work in and near America’s coalfield communities by restoring degraded lands to a usable condition, restoring aquatic life in mining-polluted streams.  BIL AML grants will also be used to provide safe drinking water in areas where groundwaters are contaminated due to abandoned coal mines.

Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration ,"The Money Follows the Person (MFP) Rebalancing Demonstration, authorized by section 6071 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171), was designed to assist States to balance their long-term care systems and help Medicaid enrollees transition from institutions to the community. Congress initially authorized up to $1.75 billion in Federal funds through Fiscal Year (FFY) 2011. With the subsequent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) in 2010, section 2403 extended the program through September 30, 2016. An additional $2.25 billion in Federal funds was appropriated through FFY 2016. Since then, section 2 of the Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-3) added $112 million in Federal funds and changed the end date for the program from September 30, 2016 to September 30, 2021. Section 5 of the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-16) changed the additional funding appropriated through the Medicaid Extenders Act from $112 million to $132 million and section 4 of the Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act of 2019 (P.L 116-39) changed the additional funding appropriated through the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act from $132 million to $254.5 million. Section 205 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94) and section 3811 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (P.L. 116-136) provided an additional $337.5 million. Section 2301 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act (P.L. 116-159) added $66.4 million, section 1107 of the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021, and other Extensions Act (P.L. 116-215) added $6.5 million. Section 204 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) added $1.253 billion, extended and made changes to the program. Any funds remaining at the end of each fiscal year carry over to the next fiscal year, and can be used to make grant awards to current grantees through FY 2023. Any unused grant funds awarded in FY 2023 can be used through FY 2027. No additional funding will be available after the final 2023 awards are made; however, grantees will submit documentation to identify projected costs and justify expenditures on an annual basis. Grantees can request to continue transitioning MFP participants until December 31, 2025 with services being provided and eligible for MFP-enhanced match through December 31, 2026. All claiming of services must be finalized by September 30, 2027. The MFP Demonstration supports State efforts to rebalance their long-term support system so that individuals have a choice of where they live and receive services. MFP program goals are (1) increase the use of home and community-based services (HCBS) and reduce the use of institutionally-based services; (2) eliminate barriers in State law, State Medicaid plans, and State budgets that restrict the use of Medicaid funds to let people get long-term care in the settings of their choice; (3) strengthen the ability of Medicaid programs to provide HCBS to people who choose to transition out of institutions,; and (4) put procedures in place to provide quality assurance and improvement of HCBS. The demonstration provides for enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for 12 months for qualified home and community-based services for each person transitioned from an institution to the community during the demonstration period. Eligibility for transition is dependent upon residence in a qualified institution for more than 60 consecutive days. The State must continue to provide community-based services after the 12-month period for as long as the person needs community services and is Medicaid eligible. Under the demonstration, the State must propose a system of Medicaid home and community-based care that will be sustained after the demonstration period and is deemed qualified by the Secretary. Specifically, the program must be conducted in conjunction with a ""qualified HCBS program"" which is a program that is in operation (or approved) in the State for such individuals in a manner that assures continuity of Medicaid coverage of services in the qualified HCBS program for eligible individuals. States may also propose to enhance the services they will provide during the demonstration period to achieve greater success with transition. States will be required to participate in a national qualitative and quantitative evaluation conducted by CMS.

Second Chance Act Reentry Initiative,"There are currently over 2.2 million individuals serving time in federal and state prisons, and millions of people cycle through local jails every year. Of those in state and federal prison, approximately 95 percent will be released and return to communities across the nation. A majority of these individuals have needs that, if unaddressed in prison, during the reentry process, and after release, will negatively impact their ability to live productive, pro-social, crime-free lives in the community. These needs include housing and employment challenges, relationship and family issues, and substance abuse and mental health problems. 

The Second Chance Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-199) helps to address these significant challenges by providing comprehensive responses to the significant number of incarcerated adults who are returning to communities from prison, jail, and juvenile residential facilities. 

Goal: The SCA supports state, local, and tribal governments and non-profit organizations in their work to reduce recidivism and improve outcomes for people returning from state and federal prisons, local jails, and juvenile facilities. 

Objective:  Promote public safety by ensuring that the transition individuals make from prison and jail to the community is successful.

Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance in Retail Food Specimens,"The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a U.S. public health surveillance system that tracks antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria from humans, retail meats, and food animals. When antimicrobial drugs are used in food-producing animals, they can enrich for populations of resistant strains that reach humans via the food supply. The chief goal of the NARMS retail food surveillance program is to improve the detection of and surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria in raw retail food commodities, particularly fresh retail meat.

The NARMS program is looking to collaborate with institutions or organizations to enhance and strengthen antibiotic resistance surveillance in retail food specimens. Partnering with the NARMS retail food surveillance program will enable the collection of critical data for FDA policy and regulatory actions including but not limited to pre-approval safety evaluation of new animal antibiotics, determining parameters for the antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine, and the ability to provide information to promote interventions to reduce resistance among foodborne bacteria. This collaboration will address NARMS programmatic needs to implement effective surveillance and response for antibiotic resistance as recommended in the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB).

National Estuary Program,"The National Estuary Program (NEP) goal is to protect and restore the water quality and estuarine resources of estuaries and associated watersheds designated by the EPA Administrator as estuaries of national significance. The 28 estuaries of national significance, or NEPs, use an ecosystem-based management approach to help achieve their protection and restoration goals. For example, each NEP characterizes the priority problems in its estuary and surrounding watershed, develops a long-term plan known as a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) that identifies actions to address those problems, and identifies partners, including lead entities, who will implement those actions. Implementation of CCMPs can include the following actions: protecting and restoring habitat, including wetlands; supporting water quality protection and restoration, including Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan implementation; monitoring for, assessing the extent of toxics loadings and pathogen contamination, and taking steps to address excess loadings and contamination; implementing stormwater management, reducing non-point source pollution impacts, and promoting the adoption of green infrastructure approaches; preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species and/or managing their impacts; developing and implementing nutrient reduction strategies; conducting climate vulnerability assessments and developing and implementing climate change adaptation strategies and using adaptation tools to promote coastal resilience; and developing and implementing strategies to provide opportunities for residents of urban minority and/or under-served communities to have greater access to urban waters, participate in urban ecosystem restoration, and participate in capacity-building/educational activities. In addition to CCMP implementation, NEPs and other eligible recipients, address urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas. NEP projects funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA, Public Law 117-58), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), should seek to: accelerate and more extensively implement CCMPs, ensure that benefits reach disadvantaged communities, build the adaptive capacity of ecosystems and communities to climate change, and leverage additional resources, including from other IIJA programs. After approval of each estuary program’s equity strategy, EPA will waive non-federal cost-share requirements for FY 2024 – FY 2026 IIJA funds. The purpose of the equity strategy is to ensure that each NEP is reviewing potential projects and utilization of IIJA funds through the lens of equitable and fair access to the benefits from environmental programs for all individuals. The equity strategy should outline how IIJA funds will be utilized to increase investments in disadvantaged communities and the benefits that flow to them.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: EPA's funding priority is to award assistance agreements that support the 28 National Estuary Programs' (NEPs) efforts to address their estuarine watersheds' priority problems identified in each of the 28 long-term management plans known as Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans (CCMPs). EPA will provide focused support for NEPs to address priority problems identified by NEP management conferences and to document accomplishments and environmental results. NEP efforts address such problems as: (1) impacts on estuarine water quality and living resources of nutrients, toxics (chemical, heavy metals), pathogen contamination, and sediment attributable to excess loadings and non-point stormwater runoff; e.g., excess nutrient loadings can result in nutrient over-enrichment and hypoxic conditions in estuarine water bodies; (2) habitat loss/degradation; (3) risks to CCMP implementation due to climate change impacts, and adaptation strategies to build regional, local, and tribal officials' capacity to address climate change impacts on NEP watersheds, and to promote community resilience. Activities that build capacity include conducting vulnerability assessments and developing and implementing climate adaptation strategies and programs; and 4) need for decision makers in estuarine communities to implement sustainable land use, green infrastructure, and low-impact development best practices. In FY 2023, EPA also funded through the NEP Coastal Watersheds Grant an intermediary organization to fund subawards that support projects that address urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal and estuarine areas.",66.456,100081847,"The National Estuary Program (NEP) goal is to protect and restore the water quality and estuarine resources of estuaries and associated watersheds designated by the EPA Administrator as estuaries of national significance.

The BLM, as a federal agency, is required under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to carry out programs to protect and recover threatened and endangered (T&E) species and the ecosystems upon which they depend and implements tasks identified in T&E recovery plans developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service. The BLM also implements conservation actions for sensitive and candidate species to preclude the need for federal listing. The Threatened and Endangered Species Program works to conserve and recover federally-listed animal and plant species and their habitat on public lands and shares cooperative responsibility with other BLM programs and partners for conservation of candidate and sensitive species. The scope of the T&E Species Program spans all taxa that merit designation under the Endangered Species Act, providing a cross section of the most imperiled species of mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, invertebrates, fish, and plants. As of 2023, there are over 330 federally threatened and endangered species and 2400 federal sensitive species occur within BLM managed lands. Public lands often provide the key habitat for species recovery and conservation. Managing more land than any other federal agency, the BLM plays a pivotal and substantive role in species recovery. Due to the commingling of federal and nonfederal lands, the BLM’s proactive commitment to conserve threatened and endangered species is essential to federal, state, and non-governmental organizations in meeting our mutual interest of species recovery. Collaboration on conservation endeavors with the ultimate goal to increase threatened and endangered species populations and manage and restore habitat of these federal trust wildlife, fish and plants within the public domain, serves a public purpose as required in cooperative agreements.

Molybdenum-99 Program,"In 2012, Congress passed the American Medical Isotopes Production Act (AMIPA), which directed the Department of Energy to establish a technology-neutral program to support the establishment of domestic supplies of molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) without the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU). The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) has implemented this by competitively awarding 50%/50% cost-shared cooperative agreements to commercial entities and providing funds to the DOE National Laboratories to support development of non-HEU Mo-99 production technologies. Mo-99 is a critical radioisotope whose decay byproduct technetium-99m (Tc-99m), is used in over 40,000 nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures performed daily in the United States. Its primary uses include diagnosing heart disease and cancer, as well as studying organ structure and function. The isotope’s short half-life and excellent binding properties make it uniquely suited for medical procedures. However, due to its short half-life it must be produced continuously to meet the medical community’s requirements. The United States does not currently have a domestic production capability for Mo-99 sufficient to meet the needs of the U.S. healthcare community, currently estimated at 4,500 6-day curies per week. The establishment of reliable, commercial, non-HEU-based Mo-99 production in the United States complements the long-standing U.S. policy to minimize and eliminate the use of proliferation-sensitive HEU in civilian applications in order to prevent the potential theft of this material for malevolent use. The United States is at the nexus of two related priorities: the need to ensure a reliable, robust Mo-99 supply for U.S. patient care, and discouraging the use of proliferation-sensitive HEU in civilian applications. NNSA will issue Cooperative Agreements with the purpose of providing additional federal funding to accelerate commercial Mo-99 projects’ time to market so that industry and government can fulfill these two critical priorities and decrease the U.S. medical community’s reliance on foreign supplies of Mo-99.",81.009,100525878,Accelerating the establishment of commercial  non-HEU-based Mo-99 production in the United States.,DOE,"ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF",NNSA

The Innovative Cardiovascular Health Program,"This program purpose is referencing unequal socioeconomic conditions and unfair opportunity structures have long existed and contribute to poor health outcomes in minority and ethnic populations and geographically and economically disadvantaged communities. Poverty, inferior housing and health care, and other debilitating social conditions are endemic to some communities, including Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and Native American communities.  
Research highlights the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including hypertension, high cholesterol, and stroke in these groups. CVD is the leading cause of death in the US and stroke is the 5th leading cause with an estimated 1 in 9 health care dollars spent treating CVD. Despite significant decreases in CVD rates in the last 20 years, NHB continue to have higher CVD mortality rates than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). In 2019, NHB women and men younger than 65 were 2.0 and 1.3 times more likely to experience premature death from CVD than their NHW counterparts. In 2020, NHB had the highest heart disease mortality rates at 228.6 per 100,000 and stroke at 56.8 per 100,000.  
Uncontrolled hypertension is the primary contributor to morbidity and mortality rate disparities in CVD between NHB and other racial and ethnic groups. In 2019, NHB had more than double the age-adjusted death rates (56.7) attributable primarily to hypertension compared to NHW (25.7). 
Of the 1 in 2 US adults with hypertension, only 26.1% have controlled blood pressure. By age 55, the cumulative incidence of hypertension reaches almost 76% in NHB men and women, compared to 54.5% and 40.0% among NHW men and women, respectively. Moreover, NHB had a 1.5 to 2 times higher risk for hypertension after adjustment for other factors, regardless of baseline blood pressure. Among NHB adults who did not report a hypertension diagnosis, a larger proportion (28%) were unaware of hypertension (BP ≥140/90 mm Hg) compared to NHW adults (16%). Despite the similar rate of hypertension treatment, only one-third of NHB adults had their blood pressure controlled, in contrast to 45.0% of NHW adults. These data clearly indicate that NHB bear the greatest burden of CVD among US adults.  
The outcomes are as stark in other CVD-related illnesses. Although the prevalence of high cholesterol in NHB is comparable to or lower than in NHW, racial-ethnic disparities occur at every level of diagnosis and management. The disparities present in low screening rates, fewer prescriptions, and medication adherence. Unsatisfactory control of high cholesterol among NHB stems from the same adverse social conditions that hinder the control of hypertension. 
Interventions must include an understanding of individual and community factors that influence a healthy diet, losing weight, being physically active, and medication adherence to address the disparities and inequities. There is a need for equity-focused health system interventions to prevent, detect, control, and manage hypertension and high cholesterol. Building on lessons from the previous work, this program focuses on comprehensive efforts to identify and respond to health care disparities and improve CVD-related outcomes, specifically for those with hypertension and high cholesterol. 
Populations of focus for this program are adults aged 18 and older with a hypertension crude prevalence of 53% or higher, as shown by data specifically at the census tract level.  Emphasis should be placed on achieving impact and reach across geographic locations where disparate populations can benefit from the strategies included in this program.",93.435,100007448,,HHS,"HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF",CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION

The National Cardiovascular Health Program,"This program supports extensive scientific evidence, links nonmedical factors, including systemic racism and the lack of economic opportunities, with poor health outcomes and increased mortality rates, all of which are preventable. Factors such as poverty, inadequate housing, poor health care, and other debilitating social conditions, commonly referred to as social determinants of health, contribute to long-standing disparities and health inequities.
These social conditions contribute to the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US population. CVD is the leading cause of death in the US; stroke is the 5th leading cause.  In 2020, about 1 in 5 adults who died from CVD were younger than 65 years old. It is estimated that 1 in 9 health care dollars are spent on CVD.   
CVD mortality rates declined for several decades due to both clinical and public health interventions, but recently declining death rates from both heart disease and stroke have stalled. One reason is that hypertension, the primary risk factor for CVD, is very common (1 in 2 US adults has hypertension) but control is not. Only 1 in 4 adults with hypertension (26.1%) has it under control.
Gains have been made in treating high cholesterol, another primary risk factor for CVD. Overall, the age-adjusted prevalence of high cholesterol decreased from 21% to 10% from 1988–1994 to 2017–2018.  This improvement is due in part to individuals’ healthy behaviors such as eating a healthy diet, losing weight, being physically active, and medication adherence, along with clinical contributions from appropriate prescribing and intensification of medication. Additional public health and health system interventions aimed at preventing, detecting, and controlling elevated cholesterol and blood pressure can help to further decrease CVD mortality. 
This program aims to implement and evaluate evidence-based strategies contributing to the prevention and management of CVD in populations disproportionately at risk. Given the importance of health equity, this program addresses social and economic factors to help communities and health systems respond to social determinants present in their communities to offer those at risk of or burdened with CVD the best health outcomes possible.",93.426,100007448,n/a,HHS,"HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF",CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION

Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council Environmental Review Improvement Fund (ERIF) Funding Program,Providing financial assistance to Tribal governments to facilitate timely and efficient environmental reviews and authorizations of FAST-41 projects.,90.800,500049443,"Federal permitting has historically suffered from inefficiencies and a lack of coordination and collaboration between Federal agencies. In 2015 Congress Enacted Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act and (FAST-41), which created the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting Council), to help address these infrastructure permitting challenges. Among other things, our agency is charged with bringing agencies across the Federal government together to coordinate and make public and transparent their environmental reviews and permitting activities for certain infrastructure projects, to discuss and resolve permitting challenges, and to establish and share best practices. 

When a developer intends to build a large infrastructure project, such as an interstate transmission line or large-scale renewable energy project, it frequently must obtain a host of permits and authorizations  from Federal, Tribal, state, and local governments, many of which themselves require extensive environmental impact reviews. Many of these permits also require  public input to be collected and considered.  

The Permitting Council works to ensure that Federal environmental review and permitting of certain infrastructure projects is transparent, predictable, and accountable. To that end, the Permitting Council administers the provisions of FAST-41 to ensure that the Federal family of agencies coordinates the entire project review process and provides a publicly-posted, real-time project permitting timetable that reflects the roadmap for and status of the environmental review and authorization process for each FAST-41 covered project. 

FAST-41 coverage is voluntary, meaning a project sponsor must apply for coverage for its project. The projects that become FAST-41 covered projects are included on the Federal Permitting Dashboard as FAST-41 covered projects.

FAST-41 authorizes the Permitting Council Executive Director to transfer funding from the FAST-41 Environmental Review Improvement Fund to state, local, and tribal governments “to facilitate timely and efficient environmental reviews and authorizations” for FAST-41 projects. Accordingly, funded activities must be linked to more timely or efficient environmental review and authorizations of FAST-41 projects.",FPISC,FEDERAL PERMITTING IMPROVEMENT STEERING COUNCIL,

Sodium Reduction in Communities,"The purpose of this program is to reduce Americans’ sodium intake to limits recommended by the Dietary Guidelines.  Because the majority of sodium that people consume is already present in foods before purchase or preparation, reducing sodium intake may require increased availability and accessibility of lower sodium items.  Efforts to reduce sodium in the food supply are occurring at a national level; however movement is also needed at the community level to affect change.  Because community-wide efforts to reduce sodium intake are relatively new, more practice-based evidence would support identification and refinement of effective strategies.  Therefore, this program will aim to implement and evaluate population-based strategies to increase access to lower sodium food in communities, and decrease sodium intake.

Research and Training in Complementary and Integrative Health,"To evaluate  complementary and integrative health approaches.  The following objectives support this goal:  (1) coordinate and facilitate the investigation of complementary and integrative health approaches through peer-reviewed grant solicitations; (2) interface with the NCCIH National Advisory Council; (3) conduct technology assessment conferences for the purpose of establishing areas of Clinical and Pre-clinical research that need to be further developed within complementary health approaches; and (4) maintain a comprehensive bibliographic data base in conjunction with the National Library of Medicine.

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) regularly examines and redefines its research priorities. In setting research priorities, NCCIH considers its existing research portfolio, its 5-year strategic plan, the recommendations of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative Health, current scientific advances, the plans of other NIH institutes and centers, and input from expert panels and stakeholders. Research constituting a rigorous evidence base for complementary health approaches will be developed through a range of research strategies including basic and translational research, and clinical investigation. Priority setting also takes into account: 1)scientific promise, 2)amenability to rigorous scientific inquiry,3) potential to change health practices, and 4) relationship to use and practice.

Research Approaches
Basic, translational, efficacy/effectiveness, and implementation research for Complementary and Integrative Health approaches need to be studied across the research continuum.  NCCIH continues to emphasize basic research that defines biological effects and mechanisms of action; this research is aimed at understanding the nature of complementary health approaches such as their biology, physiology, and physical, chemical and behavioral properties. NCCIH also supports the development of tools, models, and methodologies for studying these approaches. NCCIH  continues to encourage efficacy studies to determine specific clinical effects of complementary health approaches  under carefully controlled conditions that minimize nonspecific and contextual effects. There is also the need to strengthen translational and preliminary clinical research required to design and implement definitive clinical research and ""real world"" outcomes and effectiveness research that capitalizes on the reality that many complementary health approaches  are in widespread public use.

NCCIH’s support of translational research addresses the need for valid, reliable and relevant research tools, outcome measures, and innovative methodology to enhance the rigor of complementary health approaches within clinical studies and to ensure that they are maximally informative. NCCIH emphasizes studies that inform the design of future trials such as those that will: develop and validate outcome measures; standardize treatment protocols or algorithms;  validate treatment algorithms and/or; develop measures of quality control or treatment fidelity; assess effects of various doses or intervention durations; develop preliminary clinical evidence regarding efficacy and safety to support estimates of sample size; or establish feasibility of interventions or study designs in specific populations for future studies.

NCCIH's clinical research portfolio utilizes clinical trial, case-control, observational, cohort, qualitative, and other experimental methodologies to determine safety and estimate the efficacy of complementary health approaches. The clinical research portfolio  includes effectiveness studies of the contribution to improved health and wellness made by complementary health approaches  as they are practiced in ""real-world"" settings.
In general, phase III clinical trials will be supported under the cooperative agreement mechanism after careful consideration by NCCIH Staff. Investigators interested in proposing phase III studies are strongly encouraged to contact a relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers).

Areas of Special Interest
Fundamental scientific inquiry is essential to the progress of biomedicine by enhancing the understanding of how living systems work. This understanding serves as a foundation for translational and clinical studies that can lead to improved approaches to the management, treatment, and prevention of diseases and symptoms. One key goal is to advance our understanding of basic biological mechanisms of action of natural products, including prebiotics and probiotics. NCCIH will continue to sponsor research on compounds isolated from natural products as well as complex mixtures from which they originate. Additionally, NCCIH will continue to support research to elucidate the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the microbiota naturally present in the human body. 

Another key goal is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of action by which mind and body approaches (including, but not limited to: meditation, spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis and acupuncture) affect health, resiliency, and well-being.   

A third key goal is to develop new and improved research methods and tools for conducting rigorous studies of complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. These new methods could catalyze advances in natural product methodology and support development of novel technology and instruments to carry out rigorous research on symptom management and functional changes primarily for mind and body approaches. To improve care for hard -to-manage symptoms such as pain, anxiety, and depression, both mind and body practices and natural products will be rigorously studied using well-established methodology. 
NCCIH will also support studies in ""real world"" clinical settings to test the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches, including their integration into health care. 

Individual behavior plays a key role in health promotion and disease prevention. It is well established that adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors (e.g., diet and exercise) and modifying unhealthy behaviors reduces risks of major chronic diseases. NCCIH will investigate mechanisms of action of complementary and integrative health approaches in health resilience and practices that improve health and prevent disease. These approaches will be studied across the lifespan and in diverse populations. NCCIH will also explore research opportunities to study and access the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches in nonclinical settings such as community- and employer-based wellness programs.  

Top Scientific Priorities
The top scientific priorities include the nonpharmacologic management of pain,  neurobiological effects and mechanisms, innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products, disease prevention and health promotion across the lifespan, and clinical trials utilizing innovative study designs to access complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. Pain is the condition for which adults in the United States most often use complementary and integrative health approaches. Growing evidence indicates that some complementary health approaches may help in its treatment and management. Discovering the mechanisms by which a complementary approach exerts its effects could help in the design of better treatments and predict which people are most likely to respond. Whether and how complementary health approaches directly modulate or modify the structure and/or the function of the entire or part of the nervous system remains understudied. Advances in genomics, neuroscience, stem cells, systems biology, and neuroimaging offer excellent conceptual resources and opportunities for innovative and impactful mechanistic studies of complementary health approaches. The purpose of innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products is to advance the characterization of the biologic activity of complex natural products broadly with an emphasis on determining metabolic profiles. There has been a growing interest in the use of complementary health approaches for the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders  and for the promotion of psychological and physical health, well-being, and resilience. However, the evidence for the use of complementary modalities in the context of prevention and health promotion is modest. Rigorously designed, developmentally appropriate studies are needed to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of complementary health approaches for health promotion and disease prevention across the lifespan.

Early Stage and New Investigators
NCCIH is strongly committed to assisting new and early stage investigators in establishing a research career. Early stage investigators are those within 10 years of completing their terminal research degree, or their medical residency, or its equivalent. New investigators are those who have yet to compete successfully for a substantial (e.g., R01) NIH research grant. Each Advisory Council round, based on available funds, NCCIH: 1) will consider early stage or new investigator status as one of the criteria for designating grant applications as being of high program priority and 2) may make additional R01 grant awards to new and early stage investigators with percentiles or scores out of  payline order.

NCCIH continues to accept applications in areas not listed as a specific priority area via the investigator initiated funding opportunities. All investigators are urged to discuss potential applications with the relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers)",93.213,100019747,"The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) provides funding for research into complementary and integrative health approaches.

Priority research and technology development topics with high potential to serve these goals include, but are not limited to, the following: 
•	Data and tools to reduce trips and shift trips to climate-friendly vehicles and modes, including shift to electric vehicles, transit, micromobility services, and active transport, combined with integrated transportation and land-use planning, including transit-oriented development, such that people are less dependent on personal vehicles and more likely to walk, bike, or use transit.
•	Transformative approaches to understanding, predicting, and addressing via technology, design, behavior, and policy interventions, the induced demand and associated greenhouse gas emissions from roadway improvement projects. Methods for better incorporating induced demand into travel demand models. Evidence-based approaches and tools for decision makers for assessing the greenhouse gas emissions effects of transportation investments, policies, and practices. 
•	Cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to leverage the climate-tech industry to transform the United States to be a world leader in sustainable transportation, such as innovations in data-driven insights, automation, and integrated system-of-systems that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.
•	Innovative applications of social and behavioral sciences for transportation demand management and other policy interventions that support lower-carbon consumer transportation choices, mode shift, seamless modal connectivity, and reductions in transportation greenhouse gas emissions overall. Research supporting state and local governments considering policy options to realign consumer incentives and disincentives to encourage lower-carbon consumer choices.
•	Innovative use of new and emerging environmental sensors to support the assessment and early detection of pollutants, helping public agencies reduce climate and environmental impacts and transportation and respond to environmental emergencies, and integration of such analyses into climate and environmental justice policy decisions.
•	The development and deployment of methods to assess and reduce the risks to transportation system performance posed by climate change and related natural hazards that are exacerbated by climate change (e.g., extreme heat, pluvial flooding, slope stability concerns, permafrost thaw) Incorporation of nature-based solutions. Research and deployment of innovative resilient infrastructure, networks, and operations, especially in underserved and overburdened communities and communities with environmental justice concerns.
•	Innovative adaptation strategies and standards for the new resilient transportation networks that will be needed in vulnerable areas and for climate-driven relocation, such as new passenger rail lines and resilient access for coastal locations (e.g., transition from surface roads to waterways, elevated transportation corridors, alternate road surfaces that are environmentally friendly if damaged and can be rapidly repaired).
•	Innovative research on policy solutions to tackle challenges around deployment of transportation decarbonization technologies at the local level, such as research on balancing priorities the need for rapid deployment and adoption while centering underserved communities and prioritizing community engagement.
•	Other innovative approaches proposed by applicants that have the potential to solve climate and sustainability challenges within the U.S. transportation sector. 

In concert with U.S. DOT, the climate and transportation research center shall publish and release research results and tools that empower communities, state and local governments, metropolitan planning organizations, and commercial operators to make informed decisions on climate change and environmental justice.",20.946,100042830,"The climate crisis poses a significant threat to life on the planet, with impacts on human health, ecosystems, infrastructure, and economies globally. It is critical that greenhouse gas emissions be reduced dramatically and quickly to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Transportation is a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions globally and accounts for the largest portion (one-third) of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, it is essential to prioritize rapid decarbonization of the transportation sector across all modes. The carbon emissions associated with the extraction and manufacture of construction materials and the construction and maintenance of infrastructure must also be reduced. 
At the same time, the transportation sector itself is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise; increased storm surge and flooding events; changes to extreme weather frequency, geography, and severity; and increased wildfire frequency and extent. As a result, transportation infrastructure, networks, and operations must be made more sustainable and resilient in order to minimize loss of life and disruptions to the movement of people and goods. 
Further, American transportation systems have disproportionately and adversely affected underserved or overburdened communities. Effects include air, heat, and noise pollution, increased roadway fatalities, underinvestment in transportation infrastructure, and discriminatory housing and land-use practices that impede access to safe and reliable transportation options. Climate change stands to worsen these inequities through its impacts on air pollution, heat island effects, extreme weather, and other effects. As the transportation sector is decarbonized and made more resilient, it is critical that equity be addressed to ensure our future transportation infrastructure results in better outcomes for everyone, especially communities with environmental justice concerns.
Meeting these three challenges of transportation decarbonization, resilient infrastructure, and environmental justice necessitates research and development of new and emerging technologies in the transportation sector, including novel environmental monitoring and modeling, digitalization, artificial intelligence and machine-learning, integrated multimodal transportation systems, innovative design solutions, and other advances. Such technologies are poised to revolutionize our ability to assess and mitigate transportation’s contributions to, and impacts from, climate change. Research, development, demonstration, and deployment of such technologies are critical for the United States to reach its goal of a zero-emission transportation sector by 2050. We are now beginning to see a world where the boundaries between traditional transportation domains are blurring and blending into a more integrated holistic transportation system. This trend presents a key opportunity to ensure policies and technologies that enable such a system are developed and deployed in ways that reduce and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts of the transportation section, alleviate disproportionate burdens of transportation on overburdened and underserved communities, and deliver a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable transportation system for all.

"Airport Improvement Program, COVID-19 Airports Programs, and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Programs","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has several strategic goals: Safety, People, Global Leadership, and Operational excellence. The FAA Office of Airports (ARP) grant programs described in this listing contribute to these goals, as outlined in the FAA Annual Summary of Performance and Financial Information. 

The ARP mission is planning and developing a safe and efficient national airports system to satisfy the needs of the aviation interests of the U.S., with considerations for economics, environmental issues, local proprietary rights, and safeguarding the public investment. As an important component of that mission, ARP provides financial assistance to airports nationwide through grants. These grants contribute to the objective of maintaining and optimizing airport and runway safety, capacity, efficiency, financial responsibility, and environmental sustainability. The program objective of this listing is to assist sponsors, owners, or operators of public-use airports in the development of a nationwide system of airports adequate to meet the needs of civil aeronautics. 

The purpose of the various laws applicable to this program includes the investment in transportation, environmental protection, and airport infrastructure that will support long-term economic benefits. Grants to airports also support the objectives of several Executive Orders, including Executive Order 13985 – “Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government”, Executive Order 14005 – “Ensuring the Future is Made in all of America by All of America’s Workers”, and Executive Order 14008 – “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad” (as listed in the Regulations and Guidance Section). Performance measurement and reporting. An example of performance measurement: In the mission area of safety, the FAA Business Plan has several Initiatives, including the Initiative on Runway Pavement Maintenance. This initiative ensures that airport infrastructure is kept in a safe and serviceable condition through capital improvements and airport inspections. The related activity is to ensure runway pavement is kept in a safe and serviceable condition by maintaining eligible runway pavement in Excellent, Good, or Fair condition. The performance measure, as a specific target metric, is ensuring that this condition is met (based on visual inspections) for 93 percent of the paved runways in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). The financial assistance provided through these federal grants contribute to the capital improvements mentioned above. For performance reporting, all grants are required to submit performance reports (Annually for non-construction grants: FAA Form 5100-140 Performance Report, and quarterly for construction grants: FAA Form 5370-1 Construction Progress and Inspection Report). These reports include reporting on project milestone goals as well as lab and field testing for construction projects. With a standard period of performance of 4 years, projects must be completed within that timeframe. Projects are monitored throughout the period of performance and grant disbursements are regularly tracked. The program office monitors period of performance expirations and grant closeout in order to confirm successful project completion. A key performance indicator for the program in this listing is number of grant projects successfully completed and closed out. This measurement of grant funding disbursement as well as progress of projects towards completion aligns with and is reported on in the FAA’s Annual Performance and Accountability Report.",20.106,100003657,"The annual Airport Improvement Program (AIP) assists sponsors, owners, or operators of public-use airports in the development of a nationwide system of airports adequate to meet the needs of civil aeronautics and the flying public.

These two acts—CARES and ARPA—provide funding for the local share an airport sponsor would usually contribute to certain AIP grants. The majority of the funds under these two acts, however, were provided to eligible U.S. airports to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing these airports to mitigate their severe economic losses. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021, herein referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) provides once-in-a-generation investments in infrastructure projects at airports across the country.

Mainstream Vouchers,"The Mainstream Vouchers (previously referred to as the Mainstream 5-Year Program and/or the Section 811 Voucher Program) were originally authorized under the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-625). The Mainstream Vouchers provides tenant-based assistance to persons with disabilities. Until the passage of the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-374) (Melville Act), the program operated as a separate program distinct from the regular tenant-based Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Melville Act converted the Mainstream 5-Year Program to the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program under 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Under the Melville Act, except for serving a specific population, Mainstream vouchers are to be treated the same as regular voucher assistance. In other words, the same regulations at 24 CFR Part 982 (Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Housing Choice Voucher Program) apply to Mainstream vouchers. There is no authority to treat families that receive a Mainstream voucher differently from other applicants and participants of the HCV program. After enactment of the Melville Act (i.e., subsequent to conversion of this assistance to section 8(o) voucher assistance), funding for Mainstream voucher renewals and administrative fees was first provided in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55) under its own paragraph under the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) heading. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provided funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for the first time since the enactment of the Melville Act (in addition to renewal and administrative fee funding). These incremental vouchers exclusively assisted non-elderly persons with disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (""2019 Act"") also provided funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for non-elderly persons with disabilities, in addition to renewal and administrative fee funding. In addition, the 2019 Act states that all new and existing Mainstream vouchers must be provided to non-elderly persons with disabilities upon turnover. Consistent with prior appropriations acts, all funding for 2017-2019 Mainstream vouchers was provided under its own paragraph (e.g., paragraph (4) under the TBRA heading in the 2019 Act). While the Melville Act requires Mainstream vouchers to be treated the same as regular voucher assistance, the separate HCV Mainstream appropriations results in an accounting of Mainstream activity separate from the HCV program.",14.879,100052551,"Mainstream vouchers assist non-elderly persons with disabilities. Aside from serving a special population, Mainstream vouchers are administered using the same rules as the Tenant-based Rental Assistance program (14.871). Funding and financial reporting for Mainstream vouchers is separate from the regular tenant-based voucher program. Please see PIH Notice 2020-01 for more information. The 2017, 2018, and 2019 Appropriations Acts provided funded for new Mainstream vouchers.

Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) Recognized Coordinating Entity (RCE) Cooperative Agreement,"The purpose of this program is to support efforts to advance the establishment of an interoperable health system that (1) empowers individuals to use their electronic health information to the fullest extent (2) enables providers and communities to deliver smarter, safer, and more efficient care, and (3) promotes innovation at all levels. The Draft Trusted Exchange Framework, released on January 5, 2018, advances the goals of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) to advance nationwide interoperability by creating a common set of principles, terms, and conditions that facilitate trust between health information networks (HINs). 

The Draft Trusted Exchange Framework contains two parts: Part A—Principles for Trusted Exchange and Part B—Minimum Required Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange. Part A provides guard rails and general principles that HINs  and Qualified HINs  should follow to engender trust amongst Participants and End Users. Part B provides specific minimum required terms and conditions to be included into a single Common Agreement by a RCE. ONC will review comments received on Part A and Part B to develop a final Trusted Exchange Framework that the RCE would assist in implementing. 

Part B of the Draft Trusted Exchange Framework is not intended to be an all-encompassing participation agreement, but rather includes provisions to address identified areas of variation across existing network agreements. This funding opportunity announcement seeks to identify a single RCE that will – in collaboration with ONC – incorporate the final Part B requirements into a single Common Agreement to which Qualified HINs and their Participants may voluntarily agree to adhere. Development of a single, all-encompassing agreement that is nationwide in scope will significantly reduce the need for one-off or point-to-point interfaces, which are costly, complex to create and maintain, and an inefficient use of provider and health IT developer resources.",93.347,100004911,"The Draft Trusted Exchange Framework recognizes the significant work done by the industry over the last few years to broaden the exchange of data to meet the needs of patients and the providers who serve them. It aims to scale interoperability nationwide by providing a single “on-ramp” to allow all types of healthcare stakeholders to join any health information network they choose and be able to participate in nationwide exchange. 

The Draft Trusted Exchange Framework supports four important outcomes: 
1) Providers can access health information about their patients, regardless of where the patient received care; 
2) Patients can access their health information electronically without any special effort; 
3) Providers and payer organizations accountable for managing benefits and the health of populations can receive necessary and appropriate information on a group of individuals without having to access one record at a time (Population Level Data),which would allow them to analyze population health trends, outcomes, and costs; identify at-risk populations; and track progress on quality improvement initiatives; and 
4) The health IT community has open and accessible application programming interfaces (APIs) to encourage entrepreneurial, user-focused innovation to make health information more accessible and to improve electronic health record (EHR) usability.

While much of the Trusted Exchange Framework is based on existing capabilities in the health IT landscape, some modifications may be necessary for an entity to be considered a Qualified HIN. These updates, identified in the Draft Trusted Exchange Framework, are designed to achieve the single on-ramp and to significantly reduce the need for multiple point-to-point interfaces that are used today to achieve exchange.  As stakeholders noted during the public comment period, these interfaces are costly, complex to create and maintain, and an inefficient use of provider and health IT developer resources.",HHS,"HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF",IMMED OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

To accelerate the decline in cigarette smoking, address other tobacco use, and reduce the burden of cancer disease and death among the entire population, it will be critical to continue to focus prevention and control efforts on those populations that are most vulnerable and harder to reach with general population interventions. The complex interaction of multiple factors (e.g. socioeconomic status, cultural characteristics, acculturation, inequitable policy implementation and enforcement, stress) and persistent and targeted tobacco industry marketing to these vulnerable populations, contribute to tobacco related disparities. Many factors also contribute to cancer-related disparities such as socioeconomic status, cultural characteristics, diet, and access to healthcare services. 

Continued efforts to address the unique need for population-specific capacity and infrastructure to support tobacco and cancer control strategies and promote access to tobacco cessation services, cancer prevention, and treatment and survivor resources for populations experiencing disparities are justified.

Head Start,"Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the cognitive, physical, behavioral, and social-emotional development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services to their enrollees - low-income children and families, including those on federally recognized tribal reservations and migratory farm workers.  The program is designed to involve parents in their child’s learning and development, and to help parents make progress toward their educational, literacy, and employment goals.  Head Start also emphasizes the significant involvement of parents in the administration of their local Head Start programs.  The Head Start Program Performance Standards outline the requirements and expectations of programs in delivering these services.  Head Start programs are expected to collaborate with other early care and education programs in their communities, and to work closely with local school systems to continue the gains children achieve in Head Start.

Through Early Head Start programming, the focus includes the development of children, and the enabling of parents to fulfill their roles while moving toward self-sufficiency. These programs promote the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development of infants and toddlers through safe and developmentally enriching caregiving, preparing children for continued growth and development and eventual success in school and life. To achieve their goals, programs are supported by a three-tier training and technical assistance system (national, regional, and local) designed to complement one another. Objectives of the training and technical assistance system includes expanding staff qualifications and improving management systems and learning environments.

Since 2014 through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, access is expanded to meet the needs for infant and toddler care in communities through traditional Early Head Start programs or through partnerships with center-based and family child care providers who agree to meet the Head Start Program Performance Standards.  

The Office of Head Start Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) System improves the knowledge, skills, and practices of recipient staff to implement programs which, in turn, improve the outcomes of children and families. The system includes four National Centers, each with an area of focus that collaborate effectively to support and promote consistent practices across Head Start/Early Head Start communities.  The centers include Program Management and Fiscal Operations; Early Childhood Development, Teaching and Learning; Parent, Family, and Community Engagement; and Health, Behavioral Health, and Safety.

Farm Service Agency Taxpayer Outreach Education and Technical Assistance (American Rescue Plan Assistance),"Throughout the pandemic USDA has provided vital support to farmers and ranchers experiencing a variety of hardships from natural disasters to supply chain disruptions. This includes over $23 billion dollars in program payments through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to eligible producers to offset the financial impacts of the pandemic on American agriculture. FSA has made and continues to make a concerted effort to reach producers who are new to farming and new to working with USDA to ensure eligible producers receive the support they need. Many of the producers who participated in CFAP, particularly CFAP 2 due to increased support for specialty crops, were participating in a disaster program for the first time.

Many producers are not aware that receiving funds from USDA through activities such as an EQIP contract, disaster payments, and the pending debt relief legislation payments creates a tax liability for their farm business. Often producers who receive financial support from USDA do not have the technical knowledge or understanding of how USDA program payments are treated for tax purposes or where to get support regarding tax questions. Taxpayer education has been a longstanding issue in the agricultural community. There is a dearth of preparers in rural areas, many producers are not knowledgeable about agricultural taxes, and producers do not have the knowledge or resources necessary to integrate tax planning into their farm financial planning process. USDA frequently works with historically underserved, beginning, and limited resource producers who lack access to legal and certified public accounting services or who are unfamiliar with agricultural accounting best practices.

To address these issues the Farm Service Agency (FSA), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), seeks to partner with a variety of cooperators through cooperative agreements to develop and deliver taxpayer education to producers and key stakeholders. These agreements will focus on addressing immediate needs of producers as well as their long-term needs, with the additional benefit of developing infrastructure to support rural taxpayer education and tax preparation for limited resource, beginning, and historically underserved farmers and ranchers.",10.146,100076826,"The American Rescue Plan Act 2021, H.R. 1319, signed into law on March 11, 2021, Section 1003 allocated funding to USDA for this work and leverages FSA’s cooperative agreement authority. This was followed by the August 16, 2022, Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).  Section 22006 of this law provided additional funding to provide relief for distressed borrowers with certain FSA direct and guaranteed loans and expedited assistance to agricultural operations at risk.  

Education, technical assistance, and outreach deliverables should focus on addressing immediate needs of impacted producers as well as their long-term needs, with the additional benefit of developing infrastructure to support rural taxpayer education and tax preparation for limited resource, beginning, and historically underserved farmers and ranchers and shall include:

1)	Guides and information to assist producers in developing a general understanding of ag tax issues, the tax implications of USDA program payments, and how to protect their farm assets.  
2)	Informational and educational materials (in multiple languages) for producers including information they can give to their tax preparer, as well as information about predatory tax preparers and related schemes.
3)	Web-based resources available for download, printing, and viewing by program recipients, tax preparers and stakeholders. 
4)	Webinars and trainings for stakeholder organizations that provide information about USDA programs and financial literacy to use and deploy as part of their outreach work.
5)	Resources and information for tax preparers, including training and curriculum. 
6)	Creation of a support network of service provider hubs, leveraging and targeting organizations and institutions with a history of serving underserved producers, who can provide technical assistance by answering questions and sharing information regarding USDA program payments, how to have tax returns prepared, give producers guidance on avoiding scams and predatory tax preparers, work with tribal producers who may have different tax implications, communicate important state tax information etc., and asset protection. 
7)	Deepening the infrastructure bench as it relates to taxpayer education and available tax preparation and legal services for historically underserved farmers and ranchers in ways that include both immediate and long-term capacity building.

Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program (RCPGP),"The goal of the RCPGP is to build regional capacity and enhance community resilience in the face of catastrophic disasters and other environmental stressors, with a particular focus on addressing the needs of underserved communities and populations that are disproportionately impacted by these events. While the specific timeframe for achieving the goals may vary depending on the scope and nature of the activities and initiatives being undertaken, RCPGP is designed to support longer-term planning and implementation efforts beyond the period of performance. 

The main objectives of the RCPGP are as follows: 

To strengthen regional collaboration and coordination among government agencies and stakeholders to improve preparedness for catastrophic events. This objective is facilitated by supporting the development and implementation of regional catastrophic preparedness plans. These plans are designed to identify the risks, challenges, and potential impacts of catastrophic disasters and establish strategies for coordinating response efforts across multiple jurisdictions and disciplines to reduce long-term vulnerability. 

To enhance the capacity of regions to identify and address gaps in planning, training, and exercises related to catastrophic events. Through the RCPGP, regions can identify areas where they lack preparedness and allocate resources to address those gaps, thereby increasing community resiliency and community readiness. Additionally, the program funds exercises and training opportunities that help communities practice and improve their response to catastrophic events. 

To improve the readiness and resilience of critical infrastructure, such as transportation systems, communication networks, community housing and shelters (one of three RCPGP core capabilities for FY 2023), and public health facilities, in the event of a catastrophic incident. This includes identifying critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, conducting risk assessments, and developing strategies to mitigate those risks. The RCPGP also encourages collaboration and coordination to ensure a more comprehensive and integrated approach to disaster response. 


To increase public awareness and understanding of the risks associated with catastrophic events and the importance of preparedness measure by supporting initiatives that promote public education and outreach, particularly to disadvantaged communities to increase equity. 

These objectives are achieved over the program's multi-year timeframe and are monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure progress towards achieving them. The objectives are designed to be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) to provide a clear roadmap for program implementation and to facilitate the measurement of program effectiveness.",97.111,100011943,"The FY 2023 RCPGP encourages eligible applicants to submit project proposals that address the following core capabilities: community resilience, housing, and long-term vulnerability reduction and address the needs of disadvantaged communities.

Low Income Household Water Assistance Program,"The objective of the Low Income Household Water Assistance program is to meet unprecedented water services needs that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic. This program is meant to be an emergency program that provides quick intervention to help the people facing the high water/wastewater costs compared to their income in resuming and/or maintaining their home water/wastewater services. The benefits are limited to households with low income, particularly those that pay a high proportion of household income for drinking water and wastewater services, by providing funds to owners or operators of public water systems or treatment works to reduce arrearages of and rates charged to eligible households. Low income is defined in the federal rules as the greater of 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or 60% of State Median Income; however, each recipient (state/tribe/territory) may prescribe a lower cut-off. Recipients can also decide a household’s eligibility based on categorical eligibility of a household member, meaning someone in the household is already receiving another type of qualifying public assistance such as from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The intent to is provide financial assistance to cover water, wastewater and related services and fees. The priority is to provide assistance first and foremost to households that face the most immediate need—households whose services are already disconnected. The benefit payment and/or interventions shall be sufficient to ensure restoration of the water/wastewater services. The benefits can pay any relevant arrearage (past due amount) that is preventing service from being reconnected, as well as any related late fee, reconnection fee, penalty, etc., that is billed in normal course of billing by the water/wastewater provider to any household that has a past due balance.

The target population is low-income households, especially those with the lowest incomes and the highest home energy costs or needs in relation to income and family size. There are four components of LIHEAP: (1) block grants, (2) energy emergency contingency funds, (3) leveraging incentive awards, and (4) the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program (REACH). Block grant funds are distributed by formula to grant recipients who design their own programs according to very broad federal guidelines. Contingency funds may be awarded to grant recipients in the event of a natural disaster or other emergency and typically must be utilized under the normal statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to block grants.  Supplemental Leveraging Incentive funds allows for HHS to set aside a portion of appropriated funding to reward grant recipients that have acquired non-federal resources to provide services to LIHEAP-eligible households beyond what could be provided by Federal funds. The REACH program makes competitive grants available to grant recipients to help eligible households reduce their energy vulnerability through community-based organizations. Contingency funds,  leveraging incentive awards, and REACH funding are only administered when funding for those components is available and allocated to them.

Community-Based Violence Prevention Program,"Goals:   To eliminate youth gun and gang violence 

Objectives:  The Community-Based Violence Prevention (CBVP) Program helps states and localities support a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach to community youth gun and gang violence through prevention, intervention, suppression, and reentry in targeted communities.  The CBVP Program is designed to support and enhance programs and approaches that replicate models that have been proven to have a positive impact on the reduction of violence in target communities. Toward achievement of the ultimate goal of eliminating community violence, the CBVP Program has three main objectives: to change community norms regarding violence; to provide alternatives to violence when gangs and individuals in the community are making risky behavior decisions; and, to increase awareness of the perceived risks and costs of involvement in violence among high-risk young people. The CBVP Program supports effective use of focused deterrence (enforcement) strategies and public health and education approaches to stop violence. This will be accomplished by supporting communities to establish and strengthen partnerships between law enforcement and outreach workers, clergy, community leaders and family members in efforts to deter young people from committing violence, particularly shootings and killings.  The CBVP Program also calls for the strengthening of communities so they have the capacity to exercise social controls and to respond to issues that affect community violence.

Congress authorized AI/ANs to have access to Medicare and Medicaid services when provided through Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities located in tribal communities and amended titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to permit IHS facilities to bill Medicare and Medicaid for services provided to eligible AI/ANs. This authority was later extended to tribal facilities.  Congress has also provided authority for Indian health care programs and beneficiaries to participate in the Children’s Health Insurance program and the Health Insurance Marketplace.  
These changes have created a direct relationship between CMS and the Indian Health Service, The research conducted under this cooperative agreement is needed to help improve administration of CMS’ programs given that CMS and IHS programs operate under different and sometimes competing authorities for CMS’ programs, the Social Security Act and for IHS’ programs, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and the Indian Self Determination Education and Assistance Act, P.L. 93-638. To make CMS’ programs work with Indian health program authorities, a crucial first is step is for CMS to understand the impact of its policies on Indian health care providers and tribal members so that the agency can provide the AI/AN community greater access to CMS’ programs  in an effective and efficient manner.  

The authority at Section 1110 of the Social Security Act permits CMS to enter into grants andcooperative arrangements with organizations and certain other entities in order to aid in improving administration and effectiveness of programs administered by the agency. To this end, the work conducted under this cooperative agreement will address the potential and actual impacts of CMS’ programs on AI/ANs and the health care system serving these beneficiaries. CMS’ understanding of the impact of its policies is vital to improving greater AI/AN access to and participation in CMS’ programs; improving and ensuring that appropriate health care payments and resources are provided to IHS  tribal, and urban Indian Health program providers; and contributing to overall improved health outcomes for Indian people.

Connected Care Pilot Program,"Telehealth has assumed a critical role in health care delivery as technology and improved broadband connectivity have enabled patients to access health care services without needing to visit a health care provider’s physical location. Advances in telehealth are transforming health care from a service delivered through traditional brick and mortar health care facilities to connected care options delivered via a broadband Internet access connection directly to the patient’s home or mobile location. Despite the numerous benefits of connected care services, patients who cannot afford or who otherwise lack reliable, robust broadband Internet access connectivity, including many low-income Americans and veterans, are not realizing the benefits of these innovative telehealth technologies. The costs necessary to provide connected care services may also limit some health care providers’ ability to treat patients, particularly low-income Americans and veterans, with connected care services. To address this, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) established the Connected Care Pilot Program (Pilot Program) within the Universal Service Fund (USF or Fund) to provide funding up to $100 million over three years and to examine how the Fund can help support the trend towards connected care services, particularly for low-income Americans and veterans. The Pilot Program was set up to help defray eligible health care providers’ costs of providing connected care services, with a particular emphasis on supporting these services for eligible low-income Americans and veterans. The Commission expects that the Pilot Program will benefit many low-income and veteran patients who are responding to a wide variety of health challenges such as public health epidemics, opioid dependency, mental health conditions, high-risk pregnancy, and chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, and heart disease. The Commission also expects that the Pilot Program will provide meaningful data that will help better understand how USF funds can support health care provider and patient use of connected care services, and how supporting health care provider and patient use of connected care services can improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs.",32.007,100076366,"The Pilot Program is a limited-duration program established to provide up to $100 million in Universal Service Funds to help eligible health care providers defray the costs of providing connected care services to their patients and study how the Universal Service Fund can help support the continuing trend toward connected care services, with a primary focus on the provision of these services to low-income and veteran patients.",FCC,FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION,

Centers for Homeland Security,"DHS S&T seeks to establish a university-led consortium that work closely with DHS Components and their partners to conduct research, develop and transition mission-relevant science and technology and educate the next generation of homeland security technical and scientific challenges identified by DHS components. To accomplish this objective, DHS S&T has developed the following Centers of Excellence (COEs) and associated objectives:

The Arctic Domain Awareness Center (ADAC) will focus on interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transition in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and extreme and remote maritime environment issues. ADAC will focus on interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transition in maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and extreme and remote maritime environment issues. An interdisciplinary and experienced team of researchers is required to create an integrated array of research and education programs in the following areas: 1) maritime risk, threat analysis, and resilience research; 2) maritime domain awareness; and 3) maritime technology research.  DHS is interested in pursuing research that will address the needs and technological shortfalls that enable the USCG and other Arctic maritime operators to respond to catastrophic events.  Greater situational awareness in the Arctic maritime domain, including the Northern Bering Sea and Bering Strait, is a requirement to prevent and respond to incidents of national significance.

The Center for Accelerating Operational Efficiency (CAOE) will conduct end-user focused research to enhance the application of analytic tools to enable the DHS components and offices to realize achievable improvements in operational efficiency, and to support real-time decision making to address homeland security-related threats and hazards. The research will provide technologies, education and training to improve data management and analysis, to facilitate operations research and systems analysis, to identify the economic impact of security threats and hazards, and to critically assess risks to DHS missions and the people and property they protect. DHS expects this Center to develop the next generation of applied mathematical, computational, and statistical theory (including algorithms and methods), and to advance the quantitative analytical capabilities of DHS components and offices and their partners. This Center also will provide quantitative and analytical tools to administrators, investigators, field operators, and analysts across DHS components.

The Cross Border Threat Screening and Supply Chain Defense (CBTS) Center will research and develop solutions, protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations  that detect, assess, and respond to known and unknown biological threats and hazards that could adversely impact the Nation’s people, agriculture, and economy.  This Center’s research will provide innovations and methods to improve biothreat screening and detection, prevention, and support response.  Researchers will seek to understand how advances in bioengineering can support the needs of operators in the field when confronted with emerging threats, both naturally occurring and in situations involving intentional exposures. The Center will also research how to make sense of large amounts of data emerging from diagnostics, genetics, sensors, and the environment. Today’s analysts, first responders, professionals in public and animal health, and operators in the field are confronted with enormous amounts of data which, if understood, could assist in improving our ability to identify threats earlier and make decisions that save lives and the economy.

The Criminal Investigations and Network Analysis (CINA) Center will provide solutions to enhance investigation strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational criminal networks, cross-border criminal activities, and the growth in criminal use and exploitation of the cyber domain. CINA will develop and conduct research and education programs that will help DHS and its partners enhance investigation strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational criminal networks, cross-border criminal activities, and the growth in criminal use and exploitation of the cyber domain. The Center will provide education and professional development to improve the cost-effectiveness of criminal investigations, prosecution, prediction and prevention. CINA will also develop data, methods, tools, knowledge-products, and technology-based solutions for agents, officers and investigators to better coordinate investigative strategies and operations to predict, avert and prosecute trans-national crimes. 

The Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI) will conduct research and education that will enhance the Nation’s ability to prepare and more rapidly recover from catastrophic disruptions, supporting DHS and its partners in solving complex, interdisciplinary challenges that affect the Nation’s infrastructure. Using a place-based approach, researchers will investigate multiple linked industrial sectors, utilities, and public services. These entities collectively prove critical to business continuity and community recovery within a specific metropolitan area. The place-based approach will allow CIRI to develop solutions to enhance preparedness and recovery of the nation’s critical infrastructure systems. Critical infrastructures are the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.

The Coastal Resilience Center (CRC) will conduct research and education to enhance the Nation’s ability to safeguard people, infrastructure, and economies from catastrophic coastal natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. The Coastal Resilience Center also will consider future climate trends and their impacts on coastal resilience. Areas of research will include coastal infrastructure resilience, building resilient communities, and disaster dynamics. The overarching goal of the Center will be to advance our understanding of coastal hazards to benefit a large number of public and private entities. DHS anticipates this research will produce tangible research and education results for use by DHS, other federal agencies, state and local governments, and other relevant entities.  Soft-target Engineering to Neutralize the Threat RealitY (SENTRY) Center will focus efforts in protecting transportation environments and public venues, improving systems of collaboration across public and private entities, and producing new engineering approaches to securing crowded spaces with novel design concepts. There are growing threats from malicious threat actors that target unsecure spaces where they can inflict the gravest injury to human life and property. These threats result in physical, psychological, and financial losses on the individual, collective and societal level to the American population. To address these threats, DHS can make a difference by ensuring future public and private investment in urban infrastructure includes security principals. DHS seeks research that will ensure the Departments long-term needs are considered when infrastructure recapitalization occurs. SENTRY's research will directly support the department’s strategic framework to counter terrorism and targeted violence. The goal of SENTRY is to advance research that safeguards spaces where traditional methods to physical security are impractical to implement at scale.

The Maritime Security Center (MSC) will continue ongoing research and education activities in coordination with U.S. Coast Guard and other customers to facilitate transition of appropriate projects to DHS components and advance integrated education efforts. MSC research projects focus on the following areas: Maritime Risk, Threat Analysis, and Resilience Research; Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Research; Maritime Technology Research; and Integration of Science and Engineering with Maritime Security Governance and Policy Research. In addition to pursuing key research and education initiatives based on DHS challenges, the Center will also focus on enhancing the knowledge, technical skills, and leadership capabilities of the Nation’s current and prospective maritime security workforce. At the core of the Center’s mission is the transfer of its research and expertise into relevant, innovative educational programs. The Center’s educational programs leverage the subject matter expertise and research assets of its academic partners and stakeholder network to provide multidisciplinary and experiential learning opportunities for students and tailored programs for professional audiences.

The National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education (NCITE) Center will conduct research and develop solutions, protocols, and capabilities to support DHS operations that detect, assess, and respond to domestic terrorist activities that would harm the people and infrastructure of the United States. The Center’s research portfolio will focus on four major theme areas: the nature of counterterrorism operations, development of the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative, Terrorism Prevention, and Workforce Development. The Center will provide education and professional development to ensure that the current and future homeland security enterprise workforce is adequately trained and educated to prepare for and respond to terrorist activities.",97.061,300000272,,DHS,"HOMELAND SECURITY, DEPARTMENT OF",SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers,"The housing choice voucher program is the federal government's major program for assisting very low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market. Since housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants are able to find their own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The participant is free to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects. The program serves the most economically vulnerable families in the country, including families with disabilities, elderly families, formerly homeless veterans, and families with children, through federal assistance voucher payments in the provision of meeting their rental housing needs. HUD regulations merged the former Section 8 Rental Voucher program (14.855) with the former Section 8 Certificate program (14.857). Section 502 of the Public Housing Reform Act states that a purpose of the legislation is ""consolidating the voucher and certificate programs for rental assistance under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the ""USHA"") into a single market-driven program that will assist in making tenant-based rental assistance more successful at helping low-income families obtain affordable housing and will increase housing choice for low-income families"". The HCVP is administered by local public housing agencies (PHAs) authorized under State law to operate housing programs within an area or jurisdiction. The PHAs receive federal funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to administer the voucher program. The PHA accepts a family’s application for rental assistance, selects the applicant family for admission, and issues the selected family a voucher confirming the family’s eligibility for assistance. The family must then find and lease a dwelling unit suitable to the family’s needs and desires in the private rental market. The PHAs sign Housing Assistant Payment contracts with the landlords, and housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating family. The family then pays the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program.

Cooperative Extension Service,"GENERAL: The Cooperative Extension Service (CES) has an important role in reducing the impact of disasters through extension education. The Extension Special Needs program sponsors targeted projects that enable CES to assist in preparing for, providing an educational response to, and recovering from disasters. Education programming funded by this program will help communities, families and individuals become more self-sustaining by strengthening and increasing their resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards and disaster related events funded in previous years include uncertainties caused by losses of economic infrastructure, severe weather or other natural disasters, security breaches, human disease, or high consequence animal diseases and plant pests. There has been an increase in public awareness regarding the number and severity of disaster type critical incidents involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, contagious disease, and terrorist events. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the National Science and Technology Council have acknowledged the many effective roles that the Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played in disaster preparedness, response and remediation. Within the states and territories, the CES has repeatedly served as the trusted community organization that has helped to enable families, communities, and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond to and cope with disaster losses and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred, the local extension outreach includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based risk information, 2) Developing relevant educational experiences and programs, 3) Working with individuals and communities to open new communication channels, and 4) Mitigating losses and facilitating recovery. Never was this more evident than after hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and during the 2008 Midwestern Summer flooding. During and after these incidents, local Extension agents served as a critical communication node throughout affected urban and rural areas, particularly when traditional communication systems were temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed. The Extension Special Needs RFA encourages proposals that specifically address one or more of the following six key target areas: 1. Education and Technical assistance through inter-disciplinary and multi-state disaster training programs and demonstration projects for problem solving, especially those which build upon already existing strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN and/or eXtension educational materials related to disaster preparation, mitigation, response and recovery; 2. Collaboration with Federal, state and local agencies and other disaster relief organizations to support education and service activities that enhance recovery of impacted rural communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based activities; 3. Long range family, community and regional planning projects that will enhance implementation of programs that serve public needs in preparation for, during and after emergency situations within impacted States and across impacted regions; 4. Communication delivery of key information that meets end-users’ needs in a timely fashion with consideration of potentially limited communication channels due to disaster situations; 5. Dissemination of credible, science-based information that is reliable and easily accessible even if electronic access is compromised; and 6. Integrated Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000) are intended to provide assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for the development of highly competitive grant proposals where extension personnel would apply for large grants (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs and lead nationally important disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects. Fundable projects should support education and extension activities which: 1. Reduce risk through planning, disaster preparedness and emergency response by improving communication between the public, community leaders, state and Federal agencies; 2. Develop strategies and educational materials and/or programming in the area of emergency planning, infrastructure design and disaster recovery operation; 3.

Geographic Programs - Puget Sound Action Agenda: Technical Investigations and Implementation Assistance Program,"Puget Sound has been designated as one of 28 estuaries of National Significance under section 320 of the Clean Water Act. The goal of the National Estuary Program is to attain and maintain water quality in designated estuaries that will assure protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife and allows recreational activities in and on the water. The Puget Sound National Estuary Program's approved Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP), the Action Agenda, has a goal to restore and maintain the Puget Sound Estuary's environment by meeting 2022-2026 ecosystem targets. The Action Agenda for Puget Sound charts the course to recovery of our nation's largest estuary–it complements and incorporates the work of many partners from around Puget Sound to describe regional strategies and specific actions needed to recover Puget Sound. These strategies and actions provide opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal, and private entities to better invest resources and coordinate actions. The EPA is committed to protecting and improving water quality and minimizing the adverse impacts of rapid development in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments include protecting the watersheds and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the fundamental watershed processes that provide and create aquatic habitats and by reducing the generation and release of toxic, nutrient and pathogen pollution. This program has the following main objectives: First, implementing the approved CCMP, the Action Agenda for Puget Sound, is the primary objective of this program. Funds are directed to the highest priority work as articulated in every four-year updates to the Action Agenda work plan. The updated work plan identifies implementation strategies to achieve reductions in the harmful impacts on Puget Sound and restore previously damaged aquatic ecosystem functions. A central component of the approved CCMP for Puget Sound is its Science Work Plan which identifies some of the core scientific work that must be completed in order for Action Agenda implementation efforts to succeed. This program is to support implementation of priority near term actions and to support the technical studies and investigations that are needed to help direct implementation priorities and help support the tracking systems and evaluation approaches for implementation activities. Together with projects aimed at achievement of specific environmental outcomes, the science studies and technical investigations inform adaptive management of the program significantly contributing to the restoration and protection of Puget Sound. The program has considered relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), to invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using IIJA funds. Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2021-2026 : Funding will be continued for the three strategic initiative leads (SILs) which will  focus on: Award and manage subawards to support the implementation of the Action Agenda with a focus on Implementation Strategies; maintain Strategic Initiative Advisory Teams (SIATs) to advise in investment-related decision-making; serve as Implementation Strategy Leads for Vital Signs related to the Strategic Initiative and form technical (e.g., Interdisciplinary Teams) and/or policy workgroups to develop, refine, adaptively manage, and operationalize Implementation Strategies; participate in the Puget Sound Partnership and National Estuary Program (NEP) Management Conference processes and work groups; and proactively coordinate with tribal partners and Local Integrating Organizations (LIOs) in order to accomplish SIL work.

Direct Implementation Tribal Cooperative Agreements,"Direct Implementation Tribal Cooperative Agreements (DITCAs) enable EPA to award cooperative agreements to federally recognized Indian tribes and eligible intertribal consortia to help carry out the Agency's function to directly implement Federal environmental programs required or authorized by law in the absence of an authorized or delegated tribal program, notwithstanding the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act. DITCAs are an increasingly important avenue for EPA and the tribes to realize meaningful environmental protection in Indian Country. DITCAs enable EPA to partner with tribes to help fulfill EPA's direct implementation authorities, yield environmental results, and assist the Agency in meeting its Strategic Plan goals and targets. DITCAs also provide tribes with flexibility and opportunity by allowing tribes, through a workplan with EPA and under federal authority, to choose aspects of a program that address their tribal environmental needs and priorities, to determine the scope and pace of tribal involvement, and to build tribal capacity to implement environmental programs.

EPA is committed to work on a government-to-government basis to build tribal capacity to implement federal programs through delegations, authorizations, and primacy designations to enable tribes to meaningfully participate in the Agency’s policy making, standard setting, and direct implementation activities under federal environmental statutes. EPA will work with individual tribes to develop and implement an EPA-Tribal Environmental Plan (ETEP), a joint planning document for achieving stronger environmental and human health protection in Indian country. ETEPs identify tribal, EPA, and shared priorities, and the roles and responsibilities for addressing those priorities. EPA will focus its direct implementation efforts on areas of high need for human health or environmental protection, including programs identified in the ETEP for which tribes are not eligible, as well as those for which tribes do not currently anticipate seeking delegation, authorization, or primacy. In carrying out its direct implementation activities, EPA will work closely with tribes to develop tribal capacity to meaningfully participate in programs for which they do not anticipate seeking delegation, authorization, or primacy. EPA will also encourage tribes to participate in policy making and to assume appropriate partial roles in the implementation of programs, including through the use of DITCAs or other agreements, as available. DITCAs provide an avenue for tribes and EPA to partner in implementing meaningful environmental protection programs in Indian country.

Emergency Relief Program Outreach Education and Technical Assistance,"The Emergency Relief Program (ERP) is intended to help agricultural producers offset the impacts of natural disasters in 2020 and 2021. Congress included emergency funding in the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 117-43). ERP’s first round of disaster funding provided payments to producers using existing data and did not require outreach because producers were automatically enrolled in the program. The second phase of ERP is aimed at filling gaps and providing assistance to producers who did not participate in or receive payments through the existing risk management programs that were leveraged for phase 1 implementation. 

Phase 2 of ERP will provide assistance to producers who suffered losses due to qualifying natural disasters in 2020 and 2021. This program will be revenue based and will require participation in a risk management program for the next two crop years. These eligibility criteria and risk management linkage requirements create unique needs around outreach and technical assistance for this program. Producers will need to supply information to FSA that would typically be found on their Schedule F tax forms, and if they have not filed a Schedule F, be able to supply acceptable revenue records or create the required application data from their own farm records.  Producers will also need to identify and enroll in the appropriate risk management program for their operation.
 
The assistance ERP program participants will need in order to supply application information will be unique to their individual operation and tax situation, and more technical than the information we typically provide as part of general outreach and program education. As a result, the communication, technical support, and outreach strategies around ERP for producers need to be focused, targeted and technical in nature. This program also offers the opportunity to connect with producers who have not worked with their local FSA office, and an opportunity to not only participate in ERP but also serve as a gateway to risk management tools and other FSA and USDA programs and services. FSA has $8 million available for cooperative agreements to provide outreach and technical assistance for the Emergency Relief Program Phase 2. 

The Farm Service Agency (FSA), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), seeks to partner with stakeholder organizations to effectively reach producers, including those that are small, underserved, and not currently participating in existing programs who did not apply under phase 1 of the ERP program.  FSA is seeking proposals from eligible entities that focus on outreach for increasing awareness about ERP and have the primary goal of connecting landowners interested in program participation to apply under a traditional FSA application process. 

Expeditated outreach by stakeholders should include:
•	Technical assistance support
•	Tools for nontraditional customers
•	Office hours for stakeholders
•	Targeted, timely stakeholder feedback on areas that need improvement.",10.975,100076826,"The authorizing statutes and regulations for this opportunity are the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 117-43), which includes $10 billion in assistance to agricultural producers impacted by wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, winter storms, and other eligible disasters experienced during calendar years 2020 and 2021. The Farm Service Agency Emergency Relief Program (ERP) is another relief component of the Act.

Assistance from USDA’s FSA to selected eligible applicants to conduct targeted outreach and technical assistance on FSA programs, with an emphasis on communities of underserved, beginning, and veteran farmers and ranchers. Historically underserved groups are defined as a group whose members have been subjected to racial, ethnic, or gender prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities. Outreach and technical assistance is focused on educating agricultural producers about Phase 2 of the Emergency Relief Program. 

The following priorities and concerns were identified: 
•	Capturing damages to small, nontraditional markets that FSA does not always reach and filling gaps that other programs do not cover.
•	The program has a $10 billion cap. It is critical that the funds are used equitably, and small operations are able to participate. 
•	FSA expects limited resource producers will need support on understanding linkage requirements and identifying the appropriate risk management program for their operation.
•	This program is a new model for both our customers and county offices. Training of field staff and partners will be critical to the success of this program and to ensure equitable access. Organizations that are providing technical assistance should be included in the national or state training.

3. Phase I awards may not exceed the listed maximum award amount for each Program Code for a period normally not to exceed eight (8) months for SBIR and twelve (12) months for STTR.
4. The Phase I application should concentrate on research that will significantly contribute to proving the scientific or technical feasibility of the approach or concept, describe the potential market for the innovation and will be a prerequisite to further USDA SBIR/STTR support in Phase II. The USDA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs focus on transforming scientific discovery into products and services with commercial potential and/or societal benefit. Unlike fundamental research, the USDA SBIR/STTR programs support small businesses in the creation of innovative, and/or disruptive technologies and enable the application of research advancements from conception into the market. The STTR program aims to foster technology transfer through formal cooperative research and development (R&D) between small businesses and nonprofit research institutions.
Different from most other investors, the USDA SBIR/STTR programs fund early or ""seed"" stage research and development that has a commercial potential. The programs provide equity-free funding and entrepreneurial support at the earliest stages of company and technology development.
Key differences between USDA’s SBIR and STTR programs include the percentage of research conducted by nonprofit research institutions (e.g., universities and Federal laboratories) and the primary employment of the project’s project director/principal investigator (PD/PI). STTR applications require a formal cooperative agreement detailing the allocation of intellectual property rights to carry out follow-on research, development, or commercialization activities.

The long-term goals of the EJCPS Program are to help build the capacity of communities with environmental justice concerns and to create self-sustaining, community-based partnerships that will continue to improve local environments in the future.

Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: For the 2023 competition, EPA may give special consideration to high-ranking applications that focus on the following program priorities: 1) Rural Areas – EPA may give special consideration to high-ranking proposals to be performed in rural areas as defined by the program. Rural areas, for the purposes of this competition, are defined as local areas with populations of 50,000 or less that have limited access to public or private resources commonly found in metropolitan areas. Applicants claiming rural status must provide sufficient detail (census data, population figures, descriptions of local resources, etc.) for EPA to validate the rural status of the underserved community. The goal of this special consideration is to encourage and increase project performance in rural areas in the EPA EJ Grants program. 2) Health Impact Assessments (HIA) – HIA is a tool designed to investigate how a proposed program, project, policy, or plan may impact health and well-being and inform decision-makers of these potential outcomes before the decision is made. EPA may give special consideration to HIA projects that seek to determine the potential effects of a proposed decision on the health of underserved and vulnerable communities and the distribution of those effects within the communities. 3) Projects addressing Climate, Disaster Resiliency, and/or Emergency Preparedness – The effects of climate change and extreme weather events tend to adversely impact the most vulnerable communities and populations disproportionately. Therefore, EPA may give special consideration to projects that address the needs of underserved and vulnerable communities that have been adversely impacted or are likely to be adversely impacted by natural disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, earthquakes, and future pandemics.",66.306,100081847,"The Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving (EJCPS) Cooperative Agreement Program provides funding to support community-based organizations in their efforts to collaborate and partner with local stakeholder groups (e.g., local businesses and industry, local government, medical service providers, and academia) as they develop and implement solutions that address environmental and/or public health issues for underserved communities.",EPA,ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY,

Citizenship Education and Training,"The Office of Citizenship, Partnership and Engagement (OCPE), within US. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is charged with promoting instruction and training on the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. USCIS recognizes that naturalization is a key milestone in the civic integration of immigrants. Naturalization requirements, such as knowledge of English and of U.S. history and civics, encourage civic learning and build a strong foundation upon which immigrants can fully integrate into society. Through preparing for naturalization, immigrants will gain the tools to become successful citizens and meet their responsibilities as United States citizens. The goal of the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program is to expand the availability of high-quality citizenship preparation services for lawful permanent residents (LPRs) across the nation and to provide opportunities for lawful permanent residents to gain the knowledge and training necessary to integrate into the fabric of American society. The Citizenship and Integration Grant Program supports the objectives of Executive Order 14012, Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans, by promoting integration, inclusion, and citizenship. Furthermore, the goals of the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program address the DHS mission to enforce and administer our immigration laws as stated in the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review as the program provides lawful permanent residents instruction on the rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship and information and support on how to apply for naturalization within the authorized practice of immigration law.",97.010,100011968,"In FY 2023 there were four separate funding opportunities under the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program: 

1. Citizenship Instruction and Naturalization Application Services (CINAS): This grant opportunity will fund public or nonprofit organizations that offer both citizenship instruction and naturalization application services to lawful permanent residents (LPRs).

2.

Child Care and Development Block Grant,"The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the primary federal funding source to help certain low-income families access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. As a block grant, CCDF gives funding to States, Territories, and Tribes to provide child care subsidies primarily through vouchers or certificates to low-income families. In addition, CCDF funds are used to improve the quality of child care for both subsidized and unsubsidized children. CCDF consists of both Discretionary funding authorized by the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act and Mandatory and Matching funding under the Social Security Act. 
The CCDBG was created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508) and is subject to annual appropriations. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) consolidated funding for child care under the Social Security Act, where CCDF mandatory and matching funding is authorized, and made such funding generally subject to the requirements of the CCDBG Act. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-186) reauthorized the discretionary portion of CCDF through FY 2020 and made significant changes to improve the health, safety, and quality of child care and provide more continuous child care assistance to low-income children and families. In addition to the block grants to States, Territories and Tribes, a small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to provide technical assistance to lead agencies on administering the program.  A small portion of CCDF is also used for child care research, demonstration and evaluation activities.  The Discretionary portion of the CCDF funds provides about $7.9 billion in federal funding per year for child care. Additional funding is provided by state matching and maintenance of effort funds, as well as funds transferred from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.  Requirements for competitive grants including research grants vary and can be found in the Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs).

Community Services Block Grant Discretionary Awards,"Community Services Block Grant Discretionary Awards includes three programs: Community Economic Development (CED), Rural Community Development (RCD) and the Neighborhood innovation projects (NIP). On an annual based Congress has only provided appropriations to CED and RCD programs. NIP has never received funding. CED program provides awards on a competitive basis to private, nonprofit organizations that are community development corporations (CDCs). The CDC provides technical and financial assistance for economic development activities that address the economic needs of individuals and families with low income, through the creation of sustainable business development and employment opportunities. CED funds are used for commercial developments and equity investments or loans to capitalize a new business or expand an existing business, so the businesses can create new, full-time permanent jobs for individuals with low incomes. CED allows communities to drive the type of investment and/or business to that which is most needed in the community. Seventy-five percent of the jobs created must be filled by individuals that are below 200% of HHS poverty guideline. In addition to the CED Projects Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), CED has published three additional NOFOs that support communities with low-income that create business and job opportunities: (1) CED Focus on Social Enterprise (CED-SE); (2) CED Focus on Energy Communities (CED-Energy); and (3) CED Planning Grant (CED-Planning). All the initiatives have the same objectives of the CED program: to create economic mobility opportunities for individuals with low-income. The CED-Energy and the CED-Planning awards are aligned with President Biden’s Executive Order 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad and the Justice40 initiative. The CED-Energy program supports efforts to empower workers by revitalizing energy communities. Energy communities are communities that have experienced employment loss and/or economic dislocation events because of declines in the fossil fuel industry and/or are disproportionately reliant on fossil fuel energy production or distribution, including coal, oil, gas, and power plant communities across the country. The CED-Planning initiative is to stimulate the development of new CED projects through the provision of resources that are used to support administrative and capacity building. The RCD program provides awards to multistate, regional, and tribal nonprofit organizations that provides training and technical assistance to small, rural communities for the improvement of drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities. RCD helps community members identify and address water and wastewater related issues, including infrastructure and accessibility needs; increase access for families with low incomes to water supply and waste disposal services; preserve affordable water and waste disposal services in low-income rural communities; train water operators to ensure water systems comply with federal regulations; increase local capacity and expertise to establish and maintain needed water facilities; increase economic opportunities for low-income rural communities by ensuring they have basic water and sanitation; utilize technical assistance to leverage additional public and private resources; promote improved coordination of federal, state, and local agencies and financing programs to benefit low-income communities; and help communities establish financial stability and financial reserves to maintain water delivery and wastewater disposal systems.",93.570,300000297,"The CED program is one of seven programs within the Office of Community Services (OCS) focused on reducing poverty, and it is the only federal program that primarily focuses on creating jobs for individuals with low income in communities with high unemployment and poverty rates.

Child Care Mandatory and Matching Funds of the Child Care and Development Fund,"The Mandatory and Matching portion (or Child Care Entitlement or CCE) of the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program consists of Mandatory funds (which are 100% federal) and Matching funds (which require a State match and maintenance of effort).  The Mandatory and Matching funds are made available in section 418 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 618) and are not subject to annual appropriations. Allocations of the Mandatory Funds are based on a State's Federal share of the expenditures for the now-repealed AFDC-linked child care programs (AFDC/JOBS Child Care, Transitional Child Care, and At-Risk Child Care) in 1994 or 1995, or the average of 1992 through 1994, whichever was greater. A State is not required to expend any State funds in order to receive its share of the Mandatory Funds. Previously, the Mandatory and Matching funds provided about $2.9 billion in federal funding per year for child care.  The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2) was enacted March 11, 2021 and appropriated $3,550,000,000 (Section 9801) in mandatory and matching funding for CCDF, which is a permanent annual appropriation effective fiscal year 2021. The appropriation includes $3.375 billion to States, $75 million to Territories (previously not eligible), and $100 million to Tribes. 
 To access Matching Funds, a State must obligate all of its Mandatory Funds allotted in a fiscal year and maintain 100% of the State's share of expenditures for the former programs in fiscal year 1994 or fiscal year 1995, whichever is greater (i.e., maintenance of effort). Matching Funds must be matched at the applicable Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate, which is the Medicaid Program matching rate. The Matching Funds are distributed based on the number of children under age 13 in a State compared with the national total of children under age 13.  Section 9801 of the ARP Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2) appropriated $3.375 billion in CCDF Mandatory and Matching funds to States. Because the state Mandatory fund amount remains fixed in law, the $512,250,000 increase appropriated to states by the ARP Act are awarded in Matching funds. Matching funds are available to states if three conditions are met by the end of the fiscal year in which the funds are awarded: (1) all Mandatory funds are obligated; (2) the state’s Maintenance-of-Effort funds are expended; and (3) the state provides its share of Matching funds at the FMAP rate. However, states are not required to match the additional funds awarded in section 9801 of the ARP Act in FY 2021 or FY 2022.  Section 9801 of the ARP Act appropriated CCDF Mandatory funds to territories for the first time, including American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. Mandatory funds to territories are allotted based on the number of children under age five living in territories and per capita income in the territories. Territory Mandatory funds are not subject to any matching requirements. Territory Mandatory funds must be obligated in the fiscal year that they are awarded and liquidated in the following year.

Not less than 1%, but not more than 2% of the total Mandatory and Matching Funds are reserved for Tribes and tribal organizations based on the number of children living on or near Tribal reservations or other appropriate area served by the tribal recipient. Tribes and tribal organizations are not required to provide matching funds.  Prior to the ARP Act, Tribal lead agencies received a proportion of the child care funds appropriated under Section 418 of the Social Security Act.  Section 9801 of the ARP Act of 2021 (P.

Flood Mitigation Assistance,"Objectives

The Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program makes federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, Federally Recognized Tribal governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future. From Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 to FY 2019, FMA obligated over $1.5 billion in federal share mitigating over 8,000 properties insured by the National Flood Insurance Program. 

Performance Measures
The following key performance indicators provide strategic and relevant information to decisionmakers and stakeholders about FMA’s progress and success toward achieving goals and objectives, and are based on measurable data that are available or could be feasibly collected:

•	Total number of NFIP-insured properties selected that are FMA and/or NFIP defined Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL), Repetitive Loss (RL), and Substantially Damaged.
•	Total federal cost share funding invested in Justice40 Communities identified using version 1.0 of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST).
•	Total dollar amount of flood losses avoided in projects or communities funded by FMA subapplications.
FEMA will further assess the recipient’s performance against the program objective during the award closeout process as outlined in Section F.3.c of this funding opportunity. 

Goals
The FMA program aligns with the 2020-2024 DHS Strategic Plan through pursuing Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience. Specifically, Objective 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness has several sub-objectives that the FMA program supports. FMA serves primarily to bolster Sub-Objective 5.1.1: Incentivize investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation, including expanding the use of insurance to manage risk through funding flood mitigation projects. The FMA program addresses Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. FMA also supports the National Mitigation Investment Strategy and the FIMA FY 2021-2023 Mitigation Strategy by advancing mitigation investment to reduce risks posed by natural hazards and increasing the nation’s resilience to natural hazards. Awards made under this NOFO will be funded, in whole or in part, with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also more commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL is a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure, which will grow a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy by enhancing U.S. competitiveness, driving the creation of quality jobs, and ensuring stronger access to economic and environmental benefits for disadvantaged communities. The BIL appropriates billions of dollars to FEMA to promote resilient infrastructure, respond to the impacts of climate change, and equip our nation with the resources to combat its most pressing threats. Objectives FMA aims to implement projects that reduce flood risks posed to repetitively flooded properties insured under the NFIP. The FMA program also aims to promote equity in the delivery of funds in line with the Administration’s Justice40 Initiative, established by Executive Order (EO) 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, which has made it the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. In implementing the Justice40 Initiative, the FMA program is prioritizing assistance that benefits disadvantaged communities as referenced in EO 14008 and subsequent guidance. FMA funds are sourced from congressionally appropriated funding from the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) as well as funding made available for FY 23 Flood Mitigation Assistance via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The BIL funding allows increased federal cost share for a property: located within a census tract with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index score of not less than 0.5001.

COVID-19 Telehealth Program,"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, communities and health care providers are turning to telemedicine to enable social distancing measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.  As a result, many health care providers are expanding existing telehealth services and implementing new telehealth services, and the demand for connected care services provided directly to patients in their homes or mobile locations is skyrocketing.  In response, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, provided, among a panoply of other actions, $200 million to the Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) to support health care providers in the fight against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  The FCC, to effectuate Congress’ intent in enacting the CARES Act, established a COVID-19 Telehealth Program (Program) to distribute an appropriated budget of $200 million to help eligible health care providers maximize their provision of connected care services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To build on the success of Round 1 of the Commission’s COVID-19 Telehealth Program, in the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021, Congress appropriated an additional $249.95 million for this Program (Round 2).  First, Congress directed the Commission to seek comment on the “metrics the Commission should use to evaluate applications for funding” and “how the Commission should treat applications filed during the funding rounds for awards from the [Program] using amounts appropriated under the CARES Act . . . .”   Second, it instructed the Commission, to the extent feasible, to ensure that at least one applicant from all 50 states and the District of Columbia is awarded funds during either of the Program’s funding rounds.

Native Hawaiian Climate Resilience Program,"The goal of the Native Hawaiian Climate Resilience Program is to enhance the ability of the Native Hawaiian Community to cope with the effects of climate change by taking actions, responding to, or evolving in ways that maintain the integrity and identity of the Native Hawaiian Community while also maintaining the capacity for learning, adaptation, and transformation.",15.098,100185754,"Native Hawaiians have long recognized that culture and tradition connect people, families, and the lāhui to one another and to the lands, waters, and all living things that encompass Hawaiʻinuiākea and planet Earth. The moʻokūʻauhau (genealogies), moʻolelo, and kaʻao (traditions, histories, and stories) of Native Hawaiians detail many accounts of ancestral ingenuity and adaptation in the face of environmental change. The Office of Native Hawaiian Relations (ONHR)  joins the Native Hawaiian Community (NHC) in acknowledging our collective kuleana (responsibility) to learn, adapt, and act responsibly to ongoing environmental shifts in ways that will sustain our relationships to our planet, to our islands, to our communities, and with our families.  

Coping with Past and Present Climate Related Impacts – Activities eligible for funding may include, but are not limited to: repair and recovery of structures or cultural sites, responding to inadvertent discoveries of Native Hawaiian burials in coastal areas (iwi kūpuna), environmental restoration, invasive species removal, endangered species protection, education, health care and counseling.

Examples of climate change-related impacts include such things as:  floods, wildfires, coastal erosion, sea-level rise, habitat/ecosystem disruption, and extreme weather events.

Adaptation to Climate Change – Adaptation refers to changes in current understanding and practices in anticipation of, or preparation for, future climate change-related events.  Adaptation is often described as an iterative process involving the below adaptation cycle sub-categories:
-	Increase Awareness and Understanding concerning climate change, its effects, or resilience via training, workshops, or conferences;  
-	Assess Risks and Plan for Adaption to climate change impacts involving research, planning, or design;  
-	Implement Adaptation Measures through such things as on-site work or youth and community engagement; and 
-	Monitor and Evaluate Adaptation Actions involving research, analysis, knowledge sharing, etc. in preparation for new adaptation-type actions.

Transformative Activities – These types of activities may involve innovation, system change, and novel or “out-of-the-box” thinking with respect to climate change impacts to the NHC.  Examples might include policy research and analysis, resource management, sustainability, self-governance, co-stewardship, economic opportunities, or health and wellness; as well as Native Hawaiian innovation in culture, arts, media, technology, knowledge, energy, or education.",DOI,"INTERIOR, DEPARTMENT OF THE",DEPARTMENTAL OFFICES

Per the Code of Federal Regulations (2 CFR200.74), a pass-through entity is defined as a non-Federal entity that provides a subaward to a subrecipient to carry out part of a federal program. Under this program, EPA plans to award 5 - 11 cooperative agreements in FY 23 to pass-through entities (referred to as Grantmakers by the program) who will collaborate with EPA to design and build their own processes to receive and evaluate competitive community project applications from communities and community stakeholders addressing local environmental and/or public health issues impacting underserved and disadvantaged communities.  The Grantmaking program strives to increase the access Eligible Subrecipients have to funding, as well as reduce the burden of the federal grants application process on underserved and disadvantaged communities.

Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: SRA assistance agreements must carry out activities within the terms of EPA's statutory authorities. The statutes allow the agency to award grants or cooperative agreements that use technical assistance methods of: research, investigation, experiments, education, training, studies, and/or demonstration of innovative techniques to perform source reduction work. SRA assistance agreement activities must relate to gathering or transferring information or advancing awareness. Proposals must emphasize this ""learning"" concept, as opposed to ""fixing"" an environmental problem using a well-established method. For projects that will support demonstration activity, the project must involve new or experimental technologies, methods, or approaches, where the results of the project will be disseminated so that others can benefit from the knowledge gained in the demonstration project. A project that is accomplished through the performance of routine, traditional, or established practices, or a project that is simply intended to carry out a task rather than transfer information or advance the state of knowledge, however worthwhile the project might be, is not a demonstration. In addition, projects must demonstrate how source reduction approaches are new or experimental and how the project otherwise meets the requirements of a demonstration as described in the applicable SRA grant announcement. If the project uses technologies, methods or approaches that have been used previously in other geographic areas and/or business sectors, then an explanation must be provided in the applicant's proposal noting how the demonstration project is different from such prior projects and is a true demonstration. The applicant must also explain what will be learned from the demonstration. If the project is truly a demonstration and complies with other eligibility and grant threshold factors, then it will be considered for funding.
