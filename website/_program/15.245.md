objective: This program continues to advance the Administration's priorities to tackle
  the climate crisis.  This Program was created in response to large-scale wildfires
  in the Western US. Due to lack of native seed in 2001 Congress directed the BLM
  to establish a native plant material program recommending that federal and non-federal
  partners coordinate efforts through the Plant Conservation Alliance established
  in 1994.  BLM provides leadership in identifying, maintaining, and restoring Western
  native plant communities on public lands.  Public lands contain a diversity of wildlife
  that need habitat of native plant communities comprised of over 50 ecoregions across
  public lands.  In the future, BLM will continue to work with partners to focus on
  more diverse forbs and grasses for restoration of wildlife habitat and rehabilitation
  after wildfires.  This program also supports projects funded through the Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act P.L. 117-58, Section 40704(b) Ecosystem Restoration.
