objective: The Bureau of Land Management’s Plant Conservation and Restoration Program
  continues to advance the and Department of Interior’s priorities to address the
  climate crisis, restore balance on public lands, advance environmental justice,
  and invest in a clean energy future.  One of BLM’s highest priorities is to promote
  ecosystem health. This Program was created in response to large-scale wildfires
  in the Western US. Due to lack of native seed in 2001 Congress directed the BLM
  to establish a native plant material program recommending that federal and non-federal
  partners coordinate efforts through the Plant Conservation Alliance established
  in 1994. BLM provides leadership in identifying, maintaining, and restoring Western
  native plant communities on public lands. Public lands contain a diversity of native
  plant communities comprised of over 50 ecoregions across public lands. In the future,
  BLM will continue to work with partners to focus on increasing the diversity of
  locally adapted forbs and grasses for restoration of wildlife habitat and rehabilitation
  after wildfires. This program also supports projects funded through the Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act P.L. 117-58, Section 40704(b) Ecosystem Restoration.

    \ between private, tribal, state, local, and federal partners to guide the development,\

    \ partners to focus studies on native plant materials development to get more\
    \ diversity of native plant materials to the growers in ecoregions, including\
    \ the Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, Mojave, and Pacific Northwest. Working with\
    \ the Sustainability in Prison Program in the Great Basin, BLM PCRP grows locally\
    \ sourced sagebrush plants for use after wildfires in sage-grouse, mule deer,\
    \ and other game species habitat restoration projects. \r\nSeeds of Success has\
    \ made over 23,000 collections of 5,500 unique taxa since 2000. The Plant Conservation\
    \ & Restoration Program has moved more than 200 native species into commercial\
    \ production by the private sector, making them available for restoration projects.\
    \ BLM PCRP increased the capacity of the BLM National Seed Warehouse System to\
    \ 2,600,000 pounds, which serves 40 BLM Field Offices and streamlines seed procurement\
    \ through the Working Capital Fund (inventory value &#8776; $12 M)."

    that supports more than 1700 rare plant species, more than 400 of which are found
    exclusively on BLM public lands.

    Worked with partners to implement priority species and conservation actions.

    Assisted BLM programs such as Fuels and Emergency Stabilization and  Restoration
    in restoring public lands and integrating more wide spread use of native plant
    materials. The BLM manages these resources and other vegetation management activities
    in cooperation with states, tribes, other federal agencies, and non-governmental
