objective: 'The purpose of the Basic Center Program is to establish or strengthen
  the capacity of community-based public and private agencies to address the immediate
  needs of runaway and homeless youth under the age of 18 and their families. Emergency
  shelter and supportive services must be delivered outside of the law enforcement,
  child welfare, mental health, and juvenile justice systems. The goals and objectives
  of the Basic Center Program are to: 1) provide outreach, crisis intervention and
  aftercare; 2) reunite youth with their families, if deemed safe, and encourage the
  resolution of intra-family problems through counseling and other services; 3) strengthen
  family relationships and encourage stable living conditions for youth; and 4) help
  youth decide on constructive courses of action.


  Additional programs funded under this listing include the National Communication
  System for Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, which is a  dedicated toll-free,
  U.S. national communication system that provides information, referral services,
  crisis intervention, prevention approaches, and other supportive services to vulnerable,
  at-risk, and runaway and homeless youth and their families or legal guardians. And,
  the Runaway Homeless Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center (RHYTTAC), which
  provides direct training and technical assistance to existing and potential RHY
  grant recipients and subrecipients to enhance their efforts to successfully implement
  projects supported by FYSB grant funds.'
