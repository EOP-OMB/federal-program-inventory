objective: The purpose of BCAP is to encourage the production of biofuels.  BCAP accomplishes
  this by providing funding for agricultural and forest land owners and operators
  to receive matching payments for certain eligible material sold to qualified biomass
  conversion facilities for conversion to heat, power, bio based products, or advanced
  biofuels.  It also provides funding for producers of eligible crops of renewable
  biomass within specified project areas to receive establishment payments and annual
  payments.
