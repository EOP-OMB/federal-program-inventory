objective: In 1988, the National Park Service established the Historically Black Colleges
  and Universities (HBCU) Preservation grant program to document, preserve, and stabilize
  structures on HBCU campuses. The HBCU grant program exists to repair historic structures
  on campuses of Historically Black Colleges and Universities that are listed in the
  National Register of Historic Places either individually or as contributing to a
  National Register historic district. Projects must meet major program selection
  criteria and all work must meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines
  for Archeology and Historic Preservation.
