objective: "The objective of the San Joaquin River Restoration Program (SJRRP) is\
  \ to implement the Stipulation of Settlement in NRDC, et al., v. Rodgers, et al.,\
  \ consistent with and as supplement by, the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement\
  \ Act.\r\n\r\nThe Settlement identifies the following two goals:\r\n\r\n(1)\tRestoration\
  \ Goal - Restore and maintain fish populations in “good condition” in the main stem\
  \ of the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam to the confluence of the Merced River,\
  \ including naturally-reproducing and self-sustaining populations of salmon and\
  \ other fish; and,\r\n(2)\tWater Management Goal - Reduce or avoid adverse water\
  \ supply impacts to all of the Friant Division long-term contractors that may result\
  \ from the Interim Flows and Restoration Flows provided for in this Settlement."

    \ to recapture and recirculate these release consistent with the Settlement’s\
    \ Water Management Goal\r\n•\tContinued local groundwater banking project intended\
    \ to reduce, avoid, or offset the water supply impacts to Friant Division long-term\
    \ contractors.\r\n•\tContinued implementation of comprehensive groundwater seepage\
    \ management and monitoring program, including implementation of seepage management\

    the Stipulation of Settlement in NRDC, et al., v. Rodgers, et al.,

    consistent with and as supplement by, the San Joaquin River

    Restoration Settlement Act. These projects will contribute towards

    meeting the Restoration and Water Management goals of the

    Settlement. The SJRRP focuses on restoring flows and fish,

    including Chinook salmon, to the San Joaquin River. These

    efforts will have wide reaching benefits, including: restoring

    riparian habitat to the Restoration Area of the San Joaquin River;

    restoring ecosystem function and aquatic, riparian, and upland

    species habitats along the river; improving river channel capacities

    and flood control operations; and reconnecting the upper San

    Joaquin River to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Beyond the

    scope of the Settlement, a restored river will enhance recreational

    access and opportunities for many communities along the river.

    Specific Program accomplishments include, but are not limited to

    the following:

    • San Joaquin River remains continuously connected from

    Friant Dam to Delta since October 2016 .

    • Twenty-three spring-run Chinook salmon adults returned

    to the Restoration Area from a 2017 release, the first in

    over 60 years. Successful spawning ongoing since 2017.

    • Spring-run Chinook salmon reintroduced in 2014 with

    60,000 juveniles released and continues annually with

    250,000. Target of 1 million once hatchery is completed.

    • Completed the Funding Constrained Framework for

    Implementation in May 2017 which provides a more

    realistic schedule and budget that focuses on SJRRP

    actions from 2017–2024 for Stage 1 of Restoration.

    • Three of four ground water projects are built and

    operating, contributing to resolve SGMA.

    • The Restoration Program funded capacity correction

    actions on the Friant Kern Canal to repair subsidence.

    • Actively recapturing up to 5,000 acre-feet for recirculation

    consistent with the Settlement’s Water Management Goal

    • Progressing on various planning and design efforts for

    implementing the highest priority infrastructure projects.'

- description: "The City of Mendota and its contractor completed construction of the\
    \ Mowry Bridge, which was funded by a Reclamation grant. Reclamation now has construction\
    \ access to the southern end of the Reach 2B improvement project and a future\
    \ access point for operations and maintenance of the project.  Additionally, this\
    \ bridge serves as a potable water pipeline conduit to the underserved community\
    \ of the City of Mendota.  \n\nTulare Irrigation District completed a groundwater\
    \ recharge basin through a grant with Reclamation.  In addition, the Program received\
    \ grant funding from the State of California to support Airborne Snow Observatory\
    \ survey of snowpack above Friant Dam.\n\nThe Program is substantially involved\
    \ with satellite snowpack monitoring with the University of Colorado, Boulder,\
    \ combined with modeling to produce estimated peak snowpack conditions from 2000-\
    \ 2022."

- description: 'In partnership with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
    (CDFW), the San Joaquin River Restoration Program funded the Salmon Conservation
    and Research Facility (SCARF).  This project will provide the following: (1) develop
    and maintain a genetically diverse brood stock of spring and potentially fall
    run Chinook to support the restoration of Chinook Salmon to self-sustaining levels;
    (2) produce targets set by the San Joaquin River Restoration Program to the maximum
    extent practicable given the limitations of tank space and water supply at the
    Interim Facility, until the full-scale Conservation Facility becomes operational;
    (3) produce juvenile spring-run and fall-run Chinook, with an emphasis on spring-run
    Chinook production, to support the restoration of Chinook Salmon runs to self-sustaining
    levels; (4) support and provide research needs associated with restoring spring
    and/or fall run Chinook populations to self-sustaining levels.'
