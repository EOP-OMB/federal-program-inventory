- description: 'In partnership with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
    (CDFW), the San Joaquin River Restoration Program funded the Salmon Conservation
    and Research Facility (SCARF).  This project will provide the following: (1) develop
    and maintain a genetically diverse brood stock of spring and potentially fall
    run Chinook to support the restoration of Chinook Salmon to self-sustaining levels;
    (2) produce targets set by the San Joaquin River Restoration Program to the maximum
    extent practicable given the limitations of tank space and water supply at the
    Interim Facility, until the full-scale Conservation Facility becomes operational;
    (3) produce juvenile spring-run and fall-run Chinook, with an emphasis on spring-run
    Chinook production, to support the restoration of Chinook Salmon runs to self-sustaining
    levels; (4) support and provide research needs associated with restoring spring
    and/or fall run Chinook populations to self-sustaining levels.'
