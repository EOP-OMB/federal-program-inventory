objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators. ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is\
  \ premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future\
  \ leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect\
  \ official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today. ECA programs inform,\
  \ engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society \u2013\
  \ including young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals\
  \ \u2013 the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience with Americans\
  \ and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic\
  \ choice, and individual dignity, while building international knowledge and capacity\
  \ among Americans. The purpose of English Language Programs is to achieve U.S. foreign\
  \ policy goals and strengthen relationships with foreign publics by supporting English\
  \ language education."
