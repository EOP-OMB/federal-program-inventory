objective: As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and
  Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people
  of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and
  cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals,
  students, and educators. ECA programs foster engagement and encourage dialogue with
  citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is premised on the
  knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future leaders, and the
  benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making
  almost everywhere in the world today. ECA programs inform, engage, and influence
  participants across strategic sectors of society – including young people, women,
  teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals – the number of foreign
  individuals who have first-hand experience with Americans and with the values of
  freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic choice, and individual
  dignity, while building international knowledge and capacity among Americans. The
  purpose of English Language Programs is to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals and
  strengthen relationships with foreign publics by supporting English language education.
