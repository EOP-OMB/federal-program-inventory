objective: "Goal: The goal of this program is to build and enhance capacity and improve\
  \ delivery of legal services to individuals and tribes as well as to develop policies\
  \ that improve access to tribal justice systems. \n\nObjectives: The objective varies\
  \ with each new solicitation issued every three years, see the solicitation. For\
  \ example, the Fiscal Year 2018 TCCLA solicitation focused on development, implementation,\
  \ and enhancement of Holistic Defense initiative, a new approach to traditional\
  \ defense representation. This enhanced approach brings together an interdisciplinary\
  \ team of criminal defense, legal aid, social services, public health and public\
  \ housing and others to provide culturally appropriate services to the defense’s\
  \ client. This initiative supports Indian tribes including those who are implementing\
  \ either the Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction of the Violence Against\
  \ Women’s Act or Enhanced Sentencing Authority of the Tribal Law and Order Act or\
  \ seeking new defense strategies that can incorporate healing principles.\n\nPerformance\
  \ Measure 1:  Number of individuals who received civil legal assistance; and, \n\
  \nPerformance Measure 2:  Number of individuals who received criminal legal assistance."
