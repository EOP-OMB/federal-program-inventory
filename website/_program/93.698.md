objective: To enhance and improve coordinated systems of adult protective services
  provided by states and local communities for older adults and adults with disabilities.  The
  objective of these services is to investigate reports of abuse and exploitation,
  provide support and case management, and connect those facing abuse to a variety
  of protective, emergency, and support services to allow older adults and adults
  with disabilities to safely remain in their homes and communities. Providing adult
  protective services through this program insures that older adults and adults with
  disabilities are able to remain safe in the community.
