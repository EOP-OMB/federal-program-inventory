objective: Assistance will contribute to the basic needs of refugees and conflict
  victims spread across the African continent (both Sub-Saharan and North Africa).  NGOs
  are key partners of international organizations in Africa, often in specialized
  areas such as health care, water, sanitation, food distribution, and education.  Funds
  will be provided directly to NGOs to complement the programs of UNHCR and to bring
  basic assistance up to international life-sustaining standards of care.
