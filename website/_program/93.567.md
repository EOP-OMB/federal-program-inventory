objective: The Matching Grant Program was created in 1979 as an intensive case management
  program with the objective to fast-track new arrivals toward economic self-sufficiency
  within eight months (240 days) of program enrollment, without accessing public cash
  assistance. The Matching Grant Program assists refugees in becoming self-supporting
  and independent members of American society by providing funds to private nonprofit
  organizations to support case management, transitional assistance, and social services
  for new arrivals.
