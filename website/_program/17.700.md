  policies to promote the welfare of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions,
  increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment.
  The Women’s Bureau establishes and maintains linkage with national, community and
  faith-based organizations, business and industry, trade unions, research foundations,

- description: "In FY 2016, the Women's Bureau (WB) worked to maintain and develop\
    \ projects in response to the demands and challenges of the 21st century workforce.\
    \  The Bureau continued efforts in support of its mission “to develop policies\
    \ and standards and conduct inquiries to safeguard the interests of working women,\
    \ advocate for their equality and economic security for themselves and their families,\
    \ and promote quality work environments.”  The Bureau’s mission is as critical\
    \ today as when the agency was established in 1920, because women now comprise\
    \ almost half of the Nation’s workforce, and their contributions are vital to\
    \ our country’s economic prosperity. \r\n\r\nThe Bureau continued its role as\
    \ an advocate for women in the labor force and a vital source of information about\
    \ issues affecting working women, educating individuals and organizations at the\
    \ local, state, and national levels.  It also worked promoting policy and programmatic\
    \ changes aimed at increasing equal economic and employment opportunity for working\
    \ women and their families.  Specifically, the Bureau focused its efforts in support\
    \ of the Secretary’s vision of “Promoting and Protecting Opportunity” related\
    \ to two strategies:  Advancing Policies that Support Women and Working Families\
    \ in the 21st Century Economy; and Promoting New Opportunities for Women’s Advancement\
    \ and Earning Power.\r\n\r\nADVANCING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT WOMEN AND WORKING\
    \ FAMILIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY – In FY 2016, the Women’s Bureau continued\
    \ its collaboration with DOL’s Employment and Training Administration to administer\
    \ a paid leave grant program.  Approximately $1.25 million in grant funds were\
    \ made available for the 2015 grants to support research and analysis needed to\
    \ explore, develop, implement and/or improve paid family and medical leave programs\
    \ at the State and municipal levels, as well as in U.S. Territories and Possessions\
    \ and federally recognized Indian/Native American Tribes.  \r\n\r\nThe Bureau\
    \ also continued its collaboration with DOL agencies on advancing the latest research\
    \ and further study on paid leave benefits and costs and conducting outreach on\
    \ paid leave.  Building on the White House Summit on Working Families action plan,\
    \ the Bureau continued to advance policy initiatives targeting industries with\
    \ unique challenges to implementation of flexible workplace practices, including\
    \ those industries that employ minimum wage and lower-paid workers whose families\
    \ may depend on reliable employment of women earners.\r\n\r\nIn support of pregnant\
    \ women and nursing mothers, the WB published a user-friendly and easy to understand\
    \ guide for employers and employees on the benefits of providing reasonable accommodations\
    \ to pregnancy and nursing workers.  The guide addresses gaps in Federal law and\
    \ provides an overview of relevant state laws that could serve as models for policy\
    \ makers.  \r\n\r\nThe Bureau also conducted research on the economic impact of\
    \ child, elder, and disabled informal caregiving on women in the short-term and\
    \ long-term and the policy implications of those effects in terms of women’s economic\
    \ security, including employment, income, savings, retirement, and poverty rates.\
    \  Research was also conducted to gain a better understanding of the needs and\
    \ challenges workers face in their efforts to secure safe, quality, affordable\
    \ care for their children while in training programs.  Special emphasis for the\
    \ research included those pursuing training in the federal workforce development\
    \ system and the information gathered will be used to inform new grant initiatives.\
    \  \r\n\r\nPROMOTING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN’S ADVANCEMENT AND EARNING POWER\
    \ -- In FY 2016, the Women’s Bureau continued its work in collaboration with the\
    \ National Equal Pay Task Force, working to advance equal pay for women by reducing\
    \ occupational segregation as a barrier to equitable compensation.  The Bureau\
    \ focused on increasing opportunities for women in non-traditional careers as\
    \ one approach to reducing pay inequities between men and women and also worked\
    \ to increase women’s presence in-demand occupations that offer increased earnings\
    \ potential for women.  \r\n\r\nAnother area of research in FY16 reflected the\
    \ Bureau’s efforts around the barriers that immigrant and refugee women workers\
    \ face in moving out of low-wage jobs and into jobs in nontraditional occupations\
    \ and emerging industry sectors that pay well above minimum wage.  The Bureau’s\
    \ research resulted in the development of a fact sheet that updated data on immigrant\
    \ and refugee women workers; strategies for improving their upward mobility in\
    \ the job market; and a statistical profile, including demographic, geographic,\
    \ and employment characteristics of the population.  \r\n\r\nOUTREACH EFFORTS\
    \ -- The Bureau continued to build on and and increase its work with state and\
    \ local governments and organizations, the women’s and civil rights advocacy community,\
    \ and labor union leaders to share model practices and to continue to raise women’s\
    \ awareness of, and increase education on issues of importance to working women\
    \ and their families.  In addition to producing and updating publications, the\
    \ Bureau worked to update and improve website functionality and resources.\r\n\
    \r\nIn FY16, the WB updated its Equal Pay and Pay Secrecy publications and the\
    \ related interactive website maps.  The Bureau also released its first e-book\
    \ on Amazon.com, a long-awaited update of its women’s employment rights guide.\
    \  The publication includes information on employees’ right to equal employment\
    \ opportunity (e.g., equal pay, age discrimination, disability and reasonable\
    \ accommodation); right to be free of hostile work environments; right to family\
    \ and medical leave; right to a safe and healthy work environment; right to fair\
    \ labor standards (e.g., minimum wage and overtime); right to organize; and to\
    \ receive injury, illness, or disability benefits; etc.  \r\n\r\nThe Bureau continued\
    \ to expand its Clearinghouse website, which houses Department of Labor resources,\
    \ tools, and publications of interest to women, including resources on working\
    \ women from non-federal sources. Resources include reports, papers, policies,\
    \ fact sheets, case studies, and discussion guides, as well as interactive career\
    \ exploration activities for women; a list of non-profit organizations publishing\
    \ and interested women’s employment issues; and links to resources on topics such\
    \ as career development; compensation and wages; access to and preparation for\
    \ better jobs; workplace discrimination; workplace practices and supports; workplace\
    \ safety and violence; retirement planning; education and training programs; and\
    \ women’s rights in the workplace. The Bureau also promoted its new NTO website:\
    \ Women Protect, Build and Move America, which focuses on best practices in law-enforcement,\
    \ construction and transportation careers.  Specifically, the website offers a\
    \ repository of information for women job-seekers and service providers, including\
    \ occupational data and statistics, relevant organizations, associations and advocacy\
    \ groups, promising practices and success stories, and support service resource\
    \ and referral information. These resources are key outreach tools that benefit\
    \ practitioners, policymakers, researchers, the media and the general public.\r\
