- description: 'In FY 2022, the SBA approved natural disaster loans totaling over
    $1.96 billion, which provided disaster loan assistance for 338 disasters throughout
    the country. The SBA coordinated outreach at several major events including the
    deadly Kentucky tornadoes and floods, East and Gulf Coast hurricanes, and wildfires
    in the Pacific West. Additionally, 522 disaster survivors used the SBAâ€™s mitigation
    option in disaster loans, which serves as an Agency Priority Goal.
