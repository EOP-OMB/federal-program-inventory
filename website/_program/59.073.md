objective: 'The Paycheck Protection Program established by the CARES Act is implemented
  by the Small Business Administration with support from the Department of the Treasury.
  The effective period began March 27, 2020 through August 8, 2020. The Economic Aid
  to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act) enacted
  on December 27, 2020, provided appropriations through May 31, 2021 or until funds
  are expended, for the PPP loan program. SBA reopened the Paycheck Protection Program
  (PPP) for First Draw Loans the week of January 11, 2021. First Draw PPP Loans can
  be used to help fund payroll costs, including benefits. Funds can also be used to
  pay for mortgage interest, rent, utilities, worker protection costs related to COVID-19,
  uninsured property damage costs caused by looting or vandalism during 2020, and
  certain supplier costs and expenses for operations. Additionally, The Paycheck Protection
  Program (PPP) now allows certain eligible borrowers that previously received a PPP
  loan to apply for a Second Draw PPP Loan with the same general loan terms as their
  First Draw PPP Loan. Second Draw PPP Loans can be used to help fund payroll costs,
  including benefits. Funds can also be used to pay for mortgage interest, rent, utilities,
  worker protection costs related to COVID-19, uninsured property damage costs caused
  by looting or vandalism during 2020, and certain supplier costs and expenses for
  operations

  Business Entities (partnerships, corporations, LLC), Sole Proprietors, independent
  Contractors,  501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, 501(c)(6)Organization, 501(C) 19Veterans
  organizations, and Tribal businesses described in the Small Business Act, maybe
  eligible if they also meet program size standards and certain limitations.'
