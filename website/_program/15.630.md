objective: To provide technical and financial assistance to partners to implement
  voluntary coastal habitat protection, restoration, and improvement projects that
  benefit federal trust species, including species listed as threatened or endangered,
  migratory birds, interjurisdictional fish, and certain marine mammals.  Coastal
  habitats include, coastal wetlands, estuaries, watersheds, and shorelines, and near
  shore habitats like seagrass beds and coral reefs.  Our conservation investments
