- description: 'The PDC’s funding has remained largely unchanged over

    the past decade while its DisasterAWARE RAPIDS DoD userbase grew 10-fold, nearing
    ten thousand user accounts, data-holdings grew 12-fold, topping 4,300 layers,
    and response coverage grew 4-fold, topping 70 events and more than 350 products
    a year. These numbers have further increased this year: now more than 5000 data
    layers, 32 responses, and an astonishing 1191 products through October 2020 alone.
    The incredible growth (over three-fold compared to the previous year) in the number
    of products was due to many factors, chief among which were support for COVID-19,
    a record-breaking hurricane season, and increased partnerships with domestic,
    national, regional, and international agencies involved in disaster relief operations.

    PDC’s steady and strong growth over the past decade has been largely fueled by
    increased visibility and credibility resulting from meaningful engagements with
    the Combatant Commands (CCDM) in almost all geographies, as well as strengthened
    existing and forged new

    partnerships at home and abroad. PDC is now an integral part of planning, operational
    readiness, risk reduction, and disaster response for many CCDMs and domestic and
    international partner agencies, rightfully recognized as a preferred and credible
    partner in science- and evidence-based disaster reduction and related decision-making
    processes.

    In 2020, PDC''s DisasterAWARE supports DoD''s RAPIDS as well as EMOPS (supporting
    the Department''s and its partner''s DSCA and HA/DR missions, U.S. Interagency,
    U.S state and local  emergency managers, the international community, and partner
    nations), Disaster Alert (nearly 2M public users), as well as a host of national
    and regional systems in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, and the ASEAN Humanitarian
    Assistance Centre (AHA Centre).  The system has also been adopted by the private
    sector as "DisasterAWARE Enterprise.".'

- description: PDC's healthy growth has also been augmented and aided by "externally-funded"
    projects - those funded outside of the CA base funding.  While PDC's DisasterAWARE
    flagship product continues to attract many, its risk assessment and analytical
    capabilities are playing an ever-increasing role in informed decision-making for
    CCDMs and all stakeholders.  PDC's partnership with CCDMs to develop analytical
    products addressing "Women, Peace, and Security," "Green-White" networks to help
    identify and develop strategies against malice actors, and "National Fragility"
    index to help quantify changing landscapes of national security and stability
    are all but a few examples of PDC's maturing Global Risk and Vulnerability Assessment
    (RVA) program, aided by CCDM's partnerships in supporting and funding National
    Disaster Preparedness Baseline Assessment (NDPBA) projects around the globe.
  year: '2021'
- description: "1) Provided disaster management technology, tools, and services through\
    \ DisasterAWARE Pro, a powerful and reliable early warning and multi-hazard monitoring\
    \ platform; Disaster Alert, a free, public application of DisasterAWARE that provides\
    \ individuals, families, and their loved ones with the information they need to\
    \ stay safe anywhere in the world; and RAPIDS, designed for DoD to provide global\
    \ situational awareness for disaster risk reduction and critical information supporting\
    \ Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) missions. \n2) Incorporated\
    \ new hazard sources for NASA Global Floods through scaled architecture and Canada\
    \ Met into DisasterAWARE Pro.\n3) Provided automated hazard monitoring for 19,877\
    \ hazard events and produced 136,783 automated products. 4) Delivered decision\
    \ support products, including impacts and needs assessments during major disaster\
    \ response operations for Hurricanes Fiona, Ian, Lisa and Nicole. \n5) Expanded\
    \ National Disaster Preparedness Baseline Assessment (NDPBA) Support to Colombia\
    \ (2022-2023), Eastern Caribbean (2022-2023), Suriname (2023-2024), and Ecuador\
    \ (2023-2024).\n6) Co-chaired the United Nation’s Global Information Management\
    \ Working Group for GIS (IMWG) with UNICEF to improve inclusion and accessibility\
    \ to GIS technology to all partners in the humanitarian and development space\
    \ (traditional and non-traditional)."
