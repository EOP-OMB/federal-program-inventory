objective: Enable PDC to stimulate research, development, evaluation and deployment
  of advanced tools and applications to aid in disaster monitoring, early warning,
  and decision support for disaster management communities and the general public.  Thus,
  the overarching goal is to foster disaster-resiliency and risk reduction through
  the use of science, information, and technology.

popular_name: PDC DisasterAWARE cooperative agreement
results:
- description: 'The PDC’s funding has remained largely unchanged over

    the past decade while its DisasterAWARE RAPIDS DoD userbase grew 10-fold, nearing
    ten thousand user accounts, data-holdings grew 12-fold, topping 4,300 layers,
    and response coverage grew 4-fold, topping 70 events and more than 350 products
    a year. These numbers have further increased this year: now more than 5000 data
    layers, 32 responses, and an astonishing 1191 products through October 2020 alone.
    The incredible growth (over three-fold compared to the previous year) in the number
    of products was due to many factors, chief among which were support for COVID-19,
    a record-breaking hurricane season, and increased partnerships with domestic,
    national, regional, and international agencies involved in disaster relief operations.

    PDC’s steady and strong growth over the past decade has been largely fueled by
    increased visibility and credibility resulting from meaningful engagements with
    the Combatant Commands (CCDM) in almost all geographies, as well as strengthened
    existing and forged new

    partnerships at home and abroad. PDC is now an integral part of planning, operational
    readiness, risk reduction, and disaster response for many CCDMs and domestic and
    international partner agencies, rightfully recognized as a preferred and credible
    partner in science- and evidence-based disaster reduction and related decision-making
    processes.

    In 2020, PDC''s DisasterAWARE supports DoD''s RAPIDS as well as EMOPS (supporting
    the Department''s and its partner''s DSCA and HA/DR missions, U.S. Interagency,
    U.S state and local  emergency managers, the international community, and partner
    nations), Disaster Alert (nearly 2M public users), as well as a host of national
    and regional systems in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, and the ASEAN Humanitarian
    Assistance Centre (AHA Centre).  The system has also been adopted by the private
    sector as "DisasterAWARE Enterprise.".'

- description: PDC's healthy growth has also been augmented and aided by "externally-funded"
    projects - those funded outside of the CA base funding.  While PDC's DisasterAWARE
    flagship product continues to attract many, its risk assessment and analytical
    capabilities are playing an ever-increasing role in informed decision-making for
    CCDMs and all stakeholders.  PDC's partnership with CCDMs to develop analytical
    products addressing "Women, Peace, and Security," "Green-White" networks to help
    identify and develop strategies against malice actors, and "National Fragility"
    index to help quantify changing landscapes of national security and stability
    are all but a few examples of PDC's maturing Global Risk and Vulnerability Assessment
    (RVA) program, aided by CCDM's partnerships in supporting and funding National
    Disaster Preparedness Baseline Assessment (NDPBA) projects around the globe.
