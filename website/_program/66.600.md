objective: 'The Omnibus Territories Act (OTA) allows the Insular Areas to consolidate
  their Federal grants. Insular Areas may submit a single application for two or more
  grant programs and receive a single award in order to reduce administrative and
  application burdens. Any consolidated grant for any Insular Area shall not be less
  than the sum of all grants which such area would otherwise be entitled to receive
  for such year. The funds received under a consolidated grant shall be expended in
  furtherance of the programs and purposes authorized for any of the grants which
  are being consolidated, which are authorized under any of the Acts administered
  by the EPA, and which would be applicable to grants for such programs and purposes
  in the absence of the consolidation. The Insular Areas shall determine the proportion
  of the funds granted which shall be allocated to such programs and purposes. Consolidating
  grants under the OTA does not represent funding in addition to grants provided under
  individual authorities, but merely represents the amount of consolidation taking
  place within the Agency''s total grant appropriations. Funding Priorities - Fiscal
  Year (FY) 2024-28: Consolidated grants under the OTA support and is consistent with
  EPA Strategic Goals to: 1 – A Cleaner, Healthier Environment; and 2 – More Effective
  Partnerships. Funding priorities include all activities covered under the grant
  or cooperative agreement that align with EPA’s strategic goals and objectives (FY24-28),
  including but not limited to: establishing fishable, swimmable waters through surveillance,
  monitoring, and enforcement of water quality standards and regulations towards the
  goal of zero beach closure postings; complying with and enforcing safe drinking
  water regulations towards the goal of having potable water for 100 percent of the
  population; advancing watershed management as the overarching mission for all environmental
  protection activities to help improve water quality; establishing and managing special
  management areas to prevent groundwater contamination; and mitigating or eliminating
  nonpoint discharges of pollution.'
