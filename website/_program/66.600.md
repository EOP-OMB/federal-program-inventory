objective: "The Omnibus Territories Act (OTA) allows the Insular Areas to consolidate\
  \ their Federal grants. Insular Areas may submit a single application for two or\
  \ more grant programs and receive a single award in order to reduce administrative\
  \ and application burdens. Any consolidated grant for any Insular Area shall not\
  \ be less than the sum of all grants which such area would otherwise be entitled\
  \ to receive for such year. The funds received under a consolidated grant shall\
  \ be expended in furtherance of the programs and purposes authorized for any of\
  \ the grants which are being consolidated, which are authorized under any of the\
  \ Acts administered by the EPA, and which would be applicable to grants for such\
  \ programs and purposes in the absence of the consolidation. The Insular Areas shall\
  \ determine the proportion of the funds granted which shall be allocated to such\
  \ programs and purposes. Consolidating grants under the OTA does not represent funding\
  \ in addition to grants provided under individual authorities, but merely represents\
  \ the amount of consolidation taking place within the Agency's total grant appropriations.\
  \  \n\nFunding Priorities - Fiscal Year (FY) 2024-28: Consolidated grants under\
  \ the OTA support and is consistent with EPA Strategic Goals to: 1 \u2013 A Cleaner,\
  \ Healthier Environment; and 2 \u2013 More Effective Partnerships. Funding priorities\
  \ include all activities covered under the grant or cooperative agreement that align\
  \ with EPA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives (FY24-28), including but not limited\
  \ to: establishing fishable, swimmable waters through surveillance, monitoring,\
  \ and enforcement of water quality standards and regulations towards the goal of\
  \ zero beach closure postings; complying with and enforcing safe drinking water\
  \ regulations towards the goal of having potable water for 100 percent of the population;\
  \ advancing watershed management as the overarching mission for all environmental\
  \ protection activities to help improve water quality; establishing and managing\
  \ special management areas to prevent groundwater contamination; and mitigating\
  \ or eliminating nonpoint discharges of pollution."
