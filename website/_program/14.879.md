objective: 'The Mainstream Vouchers (previously referred to as the Mainstream 5-Year
  Program and/or the Section 811 Voucher Program) were originally authorized under
  the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-625). The Mainstream Vouchers
  provides tenant-based assistance to persons with disabilities. Until the passage
  of the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-374) (Melville
  Act), the program operated as a separate program distinct from the regular tenant-based
  Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Melville Act converted the Mainstream 5-Year
  Program to the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program under 8(o) of the U.S. Housing
  Act of 1937. Under the Melville Act, except for serving a specific population, Mainstream
  vouchers are to be treated the same as regular voucher assistance. In other words,
  the same regulations at 24 CFR Part 982 (Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Housing
  Choice Voucher Program) apply to Mainstream vouchers. There is no authority to treat
  families that receive a Mainstream voucher differently from other applicants and
  participants of the HCV program. After enactment of the Melville Act (i.e., subsequent
  to conversion of this assistance to section 8(o) voucher assistance), funding for
  Mainstream voucher renewals and administrative fees was first provided in the Consolidated
  and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55) under its own paragraph
  under the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) heading. The Consolidated Appropriations
  Act, 2017 provided funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for the first time
  since the enactment of the Melville Act (in addition to renewal and administrative
  fee funding). These incremental vouchers exclusively assisted non-elderly persons
  with disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 and the Consolidated
  Appropriations Act, 2019 ("2019 Act") also provided funding for incremental Mainstream
  vouchers for non-elderly persons with disabilities, in addition to renewal and administrative
  fee funding. In addition, the 2019 Act states that all new and existing Mainstream
  vouchers must be provided to non-elderly persons with disabilities upon turnover.
  Consistent with prior appropriations acts, all funding for 2017-2019 Mainstream
  vouchers was provided under its own paragraph (e.g., paragraph (4) under the TBRA
  heading in the 2019 Act). While the Melville Act requires Mainstream vouchers to
  be treated the same as regular voucher assistance, the separate HCV Mainstream appropriations
  results in an accounting of Mainstream activity separate from the HCV program.'
