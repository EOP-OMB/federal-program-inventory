objective: "To assist women, low-income, and minority entrepreneurs, business owners,\
  \ and other individuals possessing the capability to operate successful business\
  \ concerns and to assist small business concerns in those areas suffering from a\
  \ lack of credit due to economic downturns. Under the Program, the Small Business\
  \ Administration (SBA) makes loans or provide guaranties to private, non-profit,\
  \ and quasi-governmental organizations (intermediary lenders) that utilizes the\
  \ loan funds to make short-term, fixed interest rate microloans in amounts up to\
  \ $50,000 to start-up, newly established, and growing small business concerns. \n\
  \nThe Microloan Program is to be used exclusively for working capital, inventory,\
  \ supplies, furniture, fixtures, machinery, and/or equipment. In addition, the SBA\
  \ will make grants to participating intermediary lenders to provide marketing, management,\
  \ and technical assistance to prospective borrowers and borrowers receiving microloans.\
  \ Under the Program, SBA will also provide training for intermediary lenders participating\
  \ in the Microloan Program."
