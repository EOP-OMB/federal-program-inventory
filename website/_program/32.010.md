objective: "On March 12, 2020, the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act\
  \ of 2019 (Secure Networks Act), Pub. L. No. 116-124, was signed into law.  Section\
  \ 4 of the Secure Networks Act, 47 U.S.C. \xA7 1603, directed the Federal Communications\
  \ Commission (Commission) to establish the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks\
  \ Reimbursement Program (Reimbursement Program) to reimburse providers of advanced\
  \ communications services with two million or fewer customers for the removal, replacement,\
  \ and disposal of covered communications equipment and services from their networks.\
  \  On December 11, 2020, the Commission released a rulemaking order establishing\
  \ the Reimbursement Program.  The Commission tasked the Wireline Competition Bureau\
  \ with implementing the Reimbursement Program.  See Protecting Against National\
  \ Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain Through FCC Programs, WC Docket\
  \ No. 18-89, Second Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd 14284 (2020) (Second Report and\
  \ Order).  On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA),\
  \ Pub. L. 116-260, became law, appropriating $1.9 billion for the Commission to\
  \ \u201Ccarry out\u201D the Reimbursement Program and amending the Reimbursement\
  \ Program to, among other things, increase eligibility to those providers of advanced\
  \ communications services with ten million or fewer customers.  The Commission adopted\
  \ a rulemaking order on July 13, 2021, to implement the amendments contained in\
  \ the CAA, FCC 21-86.  Consistent with the CAA, the Commission expanded Reimbursement\
  \ Program eligibility to providers with ten million or fewer customers and limited\
  \ the use of Reimbursement Program funds to the removal, replacement, and disposal\
  \ of covered communications equipment or services produced or provided by Huawei\
  \ Technologies Company (Huawei) or ZTE Corporation (ZTE), including their subsidiaries\
  \ and affiliates, that was obtained on or before June 30, 2020.  See Protecting\
  \ Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain Through FCC\
  \ Programs, WC Docket No. 18-89, Third Report and Order, FCC 21-86 (rel. July 14,\
  \ 2021) (Third Report and Order)."
