layout: program
objective: "Provide technical and financial assistance to state and local governments\
  \ to plan and implement civilian actions necessary to alleviate and /or prevent\
  \ incompatible civilian development and other civilian activities that are likely\
  \ to impair the continued operational utility of a DoD installation, range, special\
  \ use air space, military operations area, and/or military training route.  In FY\
  \ 2023, the Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation merged these program elements\
  \ with the installation resilience program to create one broader continuum for states\
  \ and communities partner with their local installations as \u201Cone community\u201D\
  \ to identify man-made or natural threats across the community that are likely to\
  \ impair the continued operational utility of local military installations, and\
  \ then plan and carry out responses to enhance infrastructure and other resilience\
  \ measures and projects involving the protection, restoration, and maintenance of\
  \ natural features."
