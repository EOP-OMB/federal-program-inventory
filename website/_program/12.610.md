layout: program
objective: Provide technical and financial assistance to state and local governments
  to plan and implement civilian actions necessary to alleviate and /or prevent incompatible
  civilian development and other civilian activities that are likely to impair the
  continued operational utility of a DoD installation, range, special use air space,
  military operations area, and/or military training route.  In FY 2023, the Office
  of Local Defense Community Cooperation merged these program elements with the installation
  resilience program to create one broader continuum for states and communities partner
  with their local installations as “one community” to identify man-made or natural
  threats across the community that are likely to impair the continued operational
  utility of local military installations, and then plan and carry out responses to
  enhance infrastructure and other resilience measures and projects involving the
  protection, restoration, and maintenance of natural features.
