objective: The baseline tax system accepts current law’s general rule limiting taxpayers’
  ability to deduct losses from passive activities against nonpassive income (e.g.,
  wages, interest, and dividends). Passive activities generally are defined as those
  in which the taxpayer does not materially participate, though there are numerous
  additional considerations brought to bear on the determination of which activities
  are passive for a given taxpayer. Losses are limited in an attempt to limit tax
  sheltering activities. Passive losses that are unused may be carried forward and
  applied against future passive income. An exception from the passive loss limitation
  is provided for a working interest in an oil or gas property that the taxpayer holds
  directly or through an entity that does not limit the liability of the taxpayer
  with respect to the interest. Thus, taxpayers can deduct losses from such working
  interests against nonpassive income without regard to whether they materially participate
  in the activity.
