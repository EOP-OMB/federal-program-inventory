objective: 'Support, enrich, and augment Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) safety programs
  through partnerships with States, local governments, Federally recognized Indian
  tribes, other political jurisdictions, and other persons to carry out high priority
  activities and projects.  The High Priority grant program includes: 1) High Priority
  (HP) grants to implement, promote, and maintain national programs to improve CMV
  safety; increase compliance with CMV safety regulations; increase public awareness
  about CMV safety; provide education on CMV safety and related issues; and demonstrate
  new safety related technologies; and 2) Information Technology Deployment (ITD)
  grants to advance technological capability and promote deployment of intelligent
  transportation system applications (CMV, carrier, and driver) as well as support/maintain
  CMV information systems and networks.'

- description: "The FMCSA provided MHP funds to enable recipients to carry out enforcement\
    \ activities and projects that improve CMV safety and compliance with CMV regulations.\
    \ Projects commonly focused on enforcement of CMV regulations through state law\
    \ enforcement details and strike-forces. These actions routinely involved the\
    \ completion of CMV safety inspections, traffic enforcement, passenger carrier\
    \ safety, public awareness and education and to demonstrate new technologies.\
    \ In FY 2016, 42 grants were awarded totaling $15,000,000 for the above referenced\
    \ project areas. These grants remain active and final performance achievements\
    \ will be collected at the conclusion of the project period of performance. \r\
    \n\r\nEstimated outcomes:\r\nCommunity outreach events – 24,183\r\nEducational\
    \ events – 134\r\nCMV Inspections – 190,688\r\nTraffic Enforcement/Safety strike-force\

    CMV safety activities including a projected 197,000 commercial motor vehicle inspections
    (focused through details and strike-forces in high crash areas) , over 182,000
    projected traffic enforcement contacts, more than 2,100 high visibility crash
    prevention activities and several innovative technology projects to deploy enhanced
    safety technology (weigh-in-motion, inspection selection systems, automated vehicle
    information readers, etc.) on major interstates and high traffic areas. In addition,
    grant funds were awarded to conduct approximately 30 public education and outreach
    events, research into CMV safety education, technology investments and operational
    costs for State CMV safety technology and data quality systems.'

    immobilizing out-of-service carriers, investments in technology enhancements to
    State safety networks, as well as the need for PRISM compliance by the September
    30, 2020 deadline provided in the FAST Act. Finally, FMCSA established priority
    funding for those jurisdictions impacted by severe weather events in calendar
    year 2017 to replace lost and/or damaged safety equipment related to these natural
    disasters.'
