objective: "To establish a civilian training corps organized into one or more units,\
  \ at any accredited civilian educational institution authorized to grant baccalaureate\
  \ degrees.  DCTC\u2019s purpose is to prepare selected students for public service\
  \ in DoD occupations relating to acquisition, science, engineering, or other civilian\
  \ occupations determined by the Secretary of Defense, and to target critical skill\
  \ gaps.  As a scholarship-based program providing a direct path to a STEM and public\
  \ service career, DCTC will draw from a diverse population and be a natural educational\
  \ capstone to nation-wide kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) STEM programs. With\
  \ a strong corps framework, DCTC will stand apart from other scholarship programs,\
  \ inspiring a diverse and talented applicant pool. DCTC graduates will strengthen\
  \ DoD\u2019s human capital environment, contributing a uniquely-trained cohort experienced\
  \ in STEM and DoD technical challenges, and growing the DCTC model into a prestigious\
  \ pipeline for STEM and other critical DoD needs."
