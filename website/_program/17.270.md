objective: This program includes both reentry grants focused on serving returning
  adults and youth focused grants aimed at youth involved or at risk of involvement
  in crime and violence.  The objectives of the youth reentry grants include increasing
  the employment, employment retention, and earnings rate of released individuals
  while also decreasing their rate of recidivism.  The objectives of youth reentry
  grants include preventing in-school youth from dropping out of school, increasing
  the employment rate of out-of-school youth, improving the reading and math skills
  of youth, reducing the involvement of youth in crime and violence, and reducing
  the recidivism rate of youth.   The REO program facilitates a smoother reentry for
  justice-involved individuals and helps them reintegrate into their communities.  The
  goal is to develop strategies and partnerships that facilitate successful workforce
  outcomes for participants.

  year: '2021'
- description: "The Department is committed to using its REO funding to build the\
    \ evidence base on workforce development interventions serving justice-involved\
    \ adults and youth.  To support job placement, the Department maintains the Federal\
    \ Bonding Program, which provides fidelity insurance to employers that hire persons\
    \ with criminal records, as well as other at-risk job candidates.\n\nEmployer\
    \ relationships are critical to the success of reentry grants.  Grantee feedback\
    \ indicates that the majority of Reentry Employment Opportunities grants have\
    \ long-established relationships with employers in their communities.  REO grantees\
    \ tend to work most with medium-sized employers (50 - 249 employees).  The vast\
    \ majority partner with warehouse and logistics companies, followed closely by\
    \ construction and manufacturing, and culinary and food service companies.  About\
    \ half of the grantees reported working with the health care industry.  \n\nThese\
    \ employer partnerships and contributions have led to improved outcomes for participants.\
    \  The most recent adult data indicate that median earnings in the 2nd quarter\
    \ after exit have increased from $5,720 to $6,400 - a 10% increase from January\
    \ 2022.  Similarly, the employment rate in the 2nd quarter after exit has increased\
    \ for both adults and youth to 68% and 66%, respectively. For comparison, the\
    \ employment rates in the 2nd quarter after exit were 40% and 46%, respectively,\
    \ in December of 2020.  Credential attainment remained relatively steady at 89%\
    \ for adults and 70% for youth when compared with employment outcomes."
