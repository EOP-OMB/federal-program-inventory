objective: This program includes both reentry grants focused on serving returning
  adults and youth focused grants aimed at youth involved or at risk of involvement
  in crime and violence.  The objectives of the youth reentry grants include increasing
  the employment, employment retention, and earnings rate of released individuals
  while also decreasing their rate of recidivism.  The objectives of youth reentry
  grants include preventing in-school youth from dropping out of school, increasing
  the employment rate of out-of-school youth, improving the reading and math skills
  of youth, reducing the involvement of youth in crime and violence, and reducing
  the recidivism rate of youth.   The REO program facilitates a smoother reentry for
  justice-involved individuals and helps them reintegrate into their communities.  The
  goal is to develop strategies and partnerships that facilitate successful workforce
  outcomes for participants.
