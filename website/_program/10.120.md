objective: The 2017 WHIP is directly reimbursing producers for crop production losses
  in 2018. In addition to WHIP, USDA is providing a grant to Florida, which is reimbursing
  citrus producers for the cost of buying and planting replacement trees, including
  resetting and grove rehabilitation, and for repair of damages to irrigation systems.
  This grant is also providing assistance for losses of citrus production expected
  during the 2019 and 2020 crop years.
