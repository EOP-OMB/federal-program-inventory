objective: 'The Intelligence Community Centers for Academic Excellence (IC CAE) Program
  is codified in the National Security Act with the intent to increase the pool of
  applicants for Intelligence Community (IC) organizations by expanding awareness
  of the IC mission and culture throughout ethnically and geographically diverse communities.
  The IC CAE Program Office at ODNI (IC CAE PO) encourages applications that showcase
  innovative ideas for establishing enduring curricula, partnerships, and programs
  in areas of interest to the IC and national security. The IC CAE PO has found that
  the most successful recipients are those guided by personnel with knowledge of and
  experience in the IC; however, this is not a requirement. Further findings show
  that school programs are enhanced by partnerships with and outreach to IC installations
  and private industry in their regions supporting intelligence and national security
  work. The IC CAE has nine objectives that serve as the foundation of the program:
  (1) Consortium and Single Institution of Higher Education, (2) Curriculum Development,
  (3) Establish and Maintain IC CAE Program Management, Marketing, and Sustainment
  Action Plans, (4) Foreign Language Programs, (5) Faculty Research and Professional
  Development in Support of Teaching to the Chosen Curriculum Pathway, (6) Student
  Participation in Academic Programs and Professional Development Activities, (7)
  Host an Annual Colloquium or Speaker Series in Collaboration with Sub-recipients,
  (8) Study Abroad and Cultural Immersion, (9) Use of Grant Funds to Create Scholarships
  for IC CAE Scholars.'
