objective: "To provide grants and cooperative agreements to help identify, determine\
  \ sources of, assess, reduce, and prevent marine debris and its adverse impacts\
  \ on the marine environment and navigation safety within the coastal United States,\
  \ territories, and Freely Associated States. Awards that are made under this program\
  \ from annual appropriations, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)\
  \ Supplemental Appropriations Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure\
  \ Law (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021) will remove marine debris\
  \ from coastal habitats, including through interception technologies; explore non-regulatory\
  \ incentives to reduce the quantity and impacts of derelict fishing gear, abandoned\
  \ and derelict vessels, and other large debris; support regional coordination among\
  \ marine debris practitioners, states, and tribes; conduct outreach and education\
  \ activities aimed at preventing marine debris; develop interagency plans to respond\
  \ to \u201Csevere marine debris events\u201D and other natural disasters; assess\
  \ debris composition, volume, and trajectory in different marine and coastal ecosystems;\
  \ conduct research and development on marine debris impacts and distribution; and\
  \ estimate the potential impacts of marine debris on coastal resources, habitats,\
  \ and economies."
