objective: To provide grants and cooperative agreements to help identify, determine
  sources of, assess, reduce, and prevent marine debris and its adverse impacts on
  the marine environment and navigation safety within the coastal United States, territories,
  and Freely Associated States. Awards that are made under this program from annual
  appropriations, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Supplemental Appropriations
  Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act of 2021) will remove marine debris from coastal habitats,
  including through interception technologies; explore non-regulatory incentives to
  reduce the quantity and impacts of derelict fishing gear, abandoned and derelict
  vessels, and other large debris; support regional coordination among marine debris
  practitioners, states, and tribes; conduct outreach and education activities aimed
  at preventing marine debris; develop interagency plans to respond to “severe marine
  debris events” and other natural disasters; assess debris composition, volume, and
  trajectory in different marine and coastal ecosystems; conduct research and development
  on marine debris impacts and distribution; and estimate the potential impacts of
  marine debris on coastal resources, habitats, and economies.
