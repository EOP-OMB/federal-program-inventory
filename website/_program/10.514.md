objective: 'The purpose of this funding is to increase the impact of nutrition education
  disseminated to low-income families and youth in the 50 states, the U.S. territories,
  and the District of Columbia.

  EFNEP serves two primary low-income audiences: 1) families with young children (parents
  and other caregivers with primary responsibility for feeding young children); and
  2) youth/children (grade range - kindergarten through 12th grade).

  The priorities of EFNEP are to assist low-income families and youth in acquiring
  knowledge, skills, attitudes, and changed behaviors necessary for nutritionally
  sound diets and to contribute to their personal development and improvement of the
  total family diet and nutritional well-being. Participation in EFNEP should result
  in improved diets and nutritional well-being of the total family.

  Individuals and families should experience improvements in four core areas:

  Diet Quality and Physical Activity—Improved diets and nutritional and physical well-being
  through the adoption of federal food and physical activity recommendations.

  Food Resource Management—Increased ability to buy, grow, or otherwise appropriately
  obtain, prepare, and store food that meets nutritional needs.

  Food Safety—Improved household food safety and sanitation practices.

  Food Security—Increased ability to get food directly—and from food assistance programs
  where necessary—to ensure having enough healthy food to eat.'
