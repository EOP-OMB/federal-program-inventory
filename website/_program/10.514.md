objective: "The purpose of this funding is to increase the impact of nutrition education\
  \ disseminated to low-income families and youth in the 50 states, the U.S. territories,\
  \ and the District of Columbia.\r\nEFNEP serves two primary low-income audiences:\
  \ 1) families with young children (parents and other caregivers with primary responsibility\
  \ for feeding young children); and 2) youth/children (grade range - kindergarten\
  \ through 12th grade).\r\nThe priorities of EFNEP are to assist low-income families\
  \ and youth in acquiring knowledge, skills, attitudes, and changed behaviors necessary\
  \ for nutritionally sound diets and to contribute to their personal development\
  \ and improvement of the total family diet and nutritional well-being. Participation\
  \ in EFNEP should result in improved diets and nutritional well-being of the total\
  \ family.\r\nIndividuals and families should experience improvements in four core\
  \ areas:\r\n\u2022\tDiet Quality and Physical Activity\u2014Improved diets and nutritional\
  \ and physical well-being through the adoption of federal food and physical activity\
  \ recommendations.\r\n\u2022\tFood Resource Management\u2014Increased ability to\
  \ buy, grow, or otherwise appropriately obtain, prepare, and store food that meets\
  \ nutritional needs.\r\n\u2022\tFood Safety\u2014Improved household food safety\
  \ and sanitation practices.\r\n\u2022\tFood Security\u2014Increased ability to get\
  \ food directly\u2014and from food assistance programs where necessary\u2014to ensure\
  \ having enough healthy food to eat."
