objective: The Udall Undergraduate Scholarship identifies future leaders in environmental,
  Tribal public policy, and health care fields. It is highly competitive, with students
  participating in their schools' internal competitions before receiving consideration
  from the Udall Foundation. As a condition of their award, Scholars attend a multiday
  Scholar Orientation experience. Udall Undergraduate Scholarships are funded by a
  permanent trust fund endowment. Assistance is intended for the use of Scholars only.
