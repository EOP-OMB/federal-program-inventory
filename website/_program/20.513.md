objective: To provide financial assistance in meeting the transportation needs of
  seniors and individuals with disabilities where public transportation services are
  unavailable, insufficient or inappropriate. The Section 5310 program is designed
  to supplement FTA's other capital assistance programs by funding transportation
  projects for seniors and individuals with disabilities in all areas - large urban,
  small urban, and rural. Upon repeal of the New Freedom Program, its goals were incorporated
  into the Section 5310 program, which funds alternative forms of transportation where
  traditional services are unavailable, inappropriate, or insufficient. Funds can
  be used for capital and operations activities. The discretionary program assists
  in financing innovative capital projects for the transportation disadvantaged that
  improve the coordination of transportation services and non-emergency medical transportation
  (NEMT) services.
