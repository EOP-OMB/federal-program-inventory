objective: 'The Military Health System Research (MHSR) Program, provides intramural
  grants for topic areas directed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense
  for Health Affairs (OASD (HA)) and the Defense Health Agency (DHA). The intent of
  this initiative is to foster capability and capacity within the Military Health
  System (MHS) by fostering research that supports the transition to an integrated
  health system focused on the Quadruple Aim: improved health readiness, better health,
  better care, and lower cost. The Military Health System Research (MHSR) funds studies
  that identify factors that affect the economics/cost, quality, variation and outcomes
  of military health care delivery across the MHS enterprise. Some examples of applicable
  MHSR research grants include how policies, social factors, financing systems, organizational
  structures and processes, and health technologies influence health care delivery
  to individuals, families, communities, and populations within the MHS. The MHSR
  program goal is to use data driven evidence to inform policy and decision making
  that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery within
  the MHS.'

    \ \n\nExamples of projects that could be funded resulting in accomplishments include\
    \ studies that identify factors that affect the economics/cost, quality, variation\
    \ and outcomes of military health care delivery. This includes how policies, social\
    \ factors, financing systems, organizational structures and processes, health\
    \ technologies, behaviors influence the health care delivery to individuals, families,\

- description: "-Research led to expansion of the ACCESS system within the MHS that\
    \ would (1) help reduce ED crowding, (2) improve access to care through a live-tracking\
    \ system that patients can review and select from, and (3) reduce the number of\
    \ unfilled primary care appointments.  \n-The ACCESS system in place in the BAMC\
    \ ED serves as a template for other MTFs to use."

- description: 'An MHSR accomplishment at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) has
    shown significant variation in access to behavioral health resources across the
    US that can have impact to Service members and their beneficiaries. The NPS study
    reports that almost one-third of TRICARE Beneficiaries live in a community with
    inadequate mental health care access, specifically access to psychiatrists. Study
    findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA
    Network Open 6.1 (2023): e2249314-e2249314.).'
