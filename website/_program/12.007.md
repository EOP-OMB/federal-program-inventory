objective: 'The Military Health System Research (MHSR) Program, provides intramural
  grants for topic areas directed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense
  for Health Affairs (OASD (HA)) and the Defense Health Agency (DHA). The intent of
  this initiative is to foster capability and capacity within the Military Health
  System (MHS) by fostering research that supports the transition to an integrated
  health system focused on the Quadruple Aim: improved health readiness, better health,
  better care, and lower cost. The Military Health System Research (MHSR) funds studies
  that identify factors that affect the economics/cost, quality, variation and outcomes
  of military health care delivery across the MHS enterprise. Some examples of applicable
  MHSR research grants include how policies, social factors, financing systems, organizational
  structures and processes, and health technologies influence health care delivery
  to individuals, families, communities, and populations within the MHS. The MHSR
  program goal is to use data driven evidence to inform policy and decision making
  that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery within
  the MHS.'
