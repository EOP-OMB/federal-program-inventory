objective: The Military Health System Research (MHSR) Program provides intramural
  and extramural grants for topic areas directed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary
  of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD (HA)) and the Defense Health Agency (DHA). The
  intent of this initiative is to foster capability and capacity within the Military
  Health System (MHS) to conduct health system research by through intramural and
  extramural grants. The Military Health System Research (MHSR) funds studies that
  identify factors that affect the economics/cost, quality, variation, and outcomes
  of military health care delivery across the enterprise. The program goal is to use
  data-driven research to inform policy and decision making, resulting in improved
  efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery within the MHS.

- description: "No new projects funded due to Covid 19,  so no accomplishment to report.\
    \ \n\nExamples of projects that could be funded resulting in accomplishments include\
    \ studies that identify factors that affect the economics/cost, quality, variation\
    \ and outcomes of military health care delivery. This includes how policies, social\
    \ factors, financing systems, organizational structures and processes, health\
    \ technologies, behaviors influence the health care delivery to individuals, families,\
    \ communities, and populations."

- description: "-Research led to expansion of the ACCESS system within the MHS that\
    \ would (1) help reduce ED crowding, (2) improve access to care through a live-tracking\
    \ system that patients can review and select from, and (3) reduce the number of\
    \ unfilled primary care appointments.  \n-The ACCESS system in place in the BAMC\
    \ ED serves as a template for other MTFs to use."

- description: "An MHSR funded project at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) has\
    \ shown significant variation in access to behavioral health resources across\
    \ the US that can have impact to Service members and their beneficiaries. The\
    \ NPS study reports that almost one-third of TRICARE Beneficiaries live in a community\
    \ with inadequate mental health care access, specifically access to psychiatrists.\
    \ Study findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association\
    \ (JAMA Network Open 6.1 (2023): e2249314-e2249314.). The\n MHSR funded project\
    \ at Dartmouth College in collaboration with the Institute for Defense Analysis\
    \ (IDA) compared rates of utilization of low back pain (LBP) treatments (i.e.\
    \ physical therapy, manual therapy, behavioral therapies, opioid and benzodiazepine\
    \ prescription) across the MHS and their association with resolution of LBP in\
    \ the claims data.  The research reported substantial variation in the treatment\
    \ rates across catchment areas (A military treatment facility (MTF) based catchment\
    \ area consists of zip codes within a 40-mile radius of the MTF) with higher rates\
    \ of opioid prescription associated with worse outcomes (defined as an absence\
    \ of administrative claims for LBP during a 6 to 12-month period after the index\
    \ diagnosis). Results are published in the Journal Spine (Lurie, Jon D., et al.\
    \ \"A Regional Analysis of Low Back Pain Treatments in the Military Health System.\"\
    \ Spine.)"
