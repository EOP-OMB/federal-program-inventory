objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. Some States have adopted prepaid tuition
  plans, prepaid room and board plans, and college savings plans, which allow persons
  to pay in advance or save for college expenses for designated beneficiaries. Under
  current law, investment income, or the return on prepayments, is not taxed when
  earned, and is tax-exempt when withdrawn to pay for qualified expenses. Beginning
  in 2018, the definition of a qualified expense was expanded to include up to $10,000
  per child per year of expenses for primary or secondary education, including tuition
  at religious schools.
