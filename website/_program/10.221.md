objective: "This grants program is designed to promote and strengthen higher education\
  \ instruction in the food and agricultural sciences at the 34 Tribal Colleges designated\
  \ as 1994 Land-Grant Institutions in the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status\
  \ Act of 1994, as amended. Plans of Work should focus on undergraduate and/or graduate\
  \ studies in the food and agricultural sciences in one or more of the following\
  \ areas: Curricula Design and Materials Development, Faculty Development and Preparation\
  \ for Teaching, Instruction Delivery Systems, Student Experiential Learning, Equipment\
  \ and Instrumentation for Teaching, or Student Recruitment and Retention. \r\n\r\
  \nThe purpose of the TCEG Program is to provide funding to enhance educational opportunities\
  \ for Native Americans in the food and agricultural sciences.  The TCEG program\
  \ is intended to strengthen institutional capacity to deliver relevant formal education\
  \ opportunities.  The TCEG is intended to be a component of the applicant 1994 institution’s\
  \ land grant roadmap or strategic planning process.  To the extent practicable,\
  \ priorities should reflect the following national critical needs areas: \r\n1.\
  \  Sustainable energy\r\n2.  Global food security and hunger\r\n3.  Climate change\r\
  \n4.  Nutrition and preventing childhood obesity\r\n5.  Food safety\r\n6.  Sustainable\
  \ rural economies\r\n\r\nAwards are made upon approval of each institution’s application\
  \ for a grant that relate to an institution’s long-range goals.  As indicated in\
  \ Part 1, C. of the RFA, an application may address one (1) or more of the following\
  \ program areas:\r\n\tCurricula Design and Materials Development\r\n\tFaculty Development\
  \ and Preparation for Teaching\r\n\tInstruction Delivery Systems\r\n\tStudent Experiential\
  \ Learning\r\n\tEquipment and Instrumentation for Teaching\r\n\tStudent Recruitment\
  \ and Retention\r\n\r\nRecognizing that strengthening instructional programs is\
  \ a long-term ongoing process, the TCEG program is interested in funding subsequent\
  \ phases of previously funded projects in order to strengthen institutional capacity,\
  \ and institutions are encouraged to build on a theme over several grant awards\
  \ to reach institutional long-range goals.\r\n"
