  ("CARES Act") established the $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund ("the Fund").
  Eligible entities may use Fund payments to cover only those costs that: (1) are
  necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect
  to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19); (2) were not accounted for in the eligible
  entities’ most recently approved budget as of March 27, 2020; and (3) were incurred
  during the period that begins on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 30, 2020. Division
  N, Title X, Section 1001 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, (Pub. L.
  No.116-260), enacted on December 27, 2020, extended the period for which all recipients
  may incur eligible costs using payments from the Fund from December 30, 2020, to
  December 31, 2021.  Division LL, Section 104 of the Consolidated Appropriations
  Act, 2023, (Pub. L. No. 117-328), enacted on December 29, 2022, extended the period
  for which Tribal governments may incur eligible costs using payments to December
  31, 2022. Governments otherwise had broad discretion to utilize payments for expenditures
  ranging from COVID-19 testing to reimbursing small businesses for the costs of business
  interruption caused by required closures.'
