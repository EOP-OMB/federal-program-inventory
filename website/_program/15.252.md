objective: "The objectives of the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) Program are defined in\
  \ the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) is the protection\
  \ of public health, safety, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects\
  \ of coal mining practices; the restoration of land and water resources and the\
  \ environment that have been degraded by the adverse effects of coal mining practices,\
  \ the protection of public health and safety from adverse effects of coal mining\
  \ practices, the restoration of land and water resources and the environment that\
  \ have been degraded by the adverse effects of coal mining practices and emergency\
  \ restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of adverse effects\
  \ of coal mining practices, on eligible lands. \n\nThe objectives of the Abandoned\
  \ Mine Land Economic Revitalization (AMLER) Program are to develop eligible projects\
  \ that demonstrate a nexus with AML land and water reclamation, and economic and\
  \ community development. The AMLER Program is an opportunity for local communities\
  \ and States/Tribes to return impacted areas to productive reuse, which should be\
  \ defined by the States/Tribes in cooperation with local communities, to achieve\
  \ the economic and community development goals identified for the community and/or\
  \ region.  \n\nThe objective of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) Program\
  \ is to address coal AML related problems including coal AML emergencies, physical\
  \ hazards resulting from legacy coal mining that pose a threat to public health,\
  \ safety, and the environment (including acid mine drainage), and water supply that\
  \ has been adversely affected by legacy coal mining.  In addition, the BIL encourages\
  \ States and Tribes to prioritize projects that provide employment for current and\
  \ former employees of the coal industry."
