objective: 'Congress appropriated funding starting in fiscal year 2023 for EPA to
  establish and implement a grant program to assist Tribal entities in Alaska with
  addressing contamination on Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act lands that were
  contaminated prior to the time of conveyance. Grants may be used for site assessment
  and remediation, as well as related community outreach and involvement. The Alaska
  Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971 (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) included the
  transfer of 44 million acres to Alaska Native regional and village corporations.
  Some of these lands were contaminated prior to conveyance (transfer) to Alaska Native
  corporations from a variety of past activities such as fuel storage, power generation,
  waste handling practices, mining, and other activities. These contaminants can pose
  health concerns to Alaska Native communities, impact subsistence resources, and
  impair cultural or economic activities.


  The contaminated sites are on lands formerly managed by federal government agencies
  within the United States (U.S) and then conveyed by the U.S. Department of Interior’s
  Bureau of Land Management, to Alaska Native Corporations pursuant to ANCSA. These
  sites were conveyed with pre- existing contamination. EPA is maintaining an inventory
  of such sites on its Contaminated ANCSA Sites Common Operating Picture.


  The objectives of EPA’s Contaminated ANCSA Lands Assistance Agreements are to provide
  funding to:

  (1) characterize, assess, and conduct planning and community involvement activities
  related to these lands; and (2) carry out cleanup activities at contaminated ANCSA
  sites.'

results:
- description: 'Removal of 75 super-sacks containing over 500 tons of PCB contaminated
    soil from a legacy contaminated ANCSA site resulting from the actions of WWII
    in the Aleutian Islands.


    Completed phase 1 of a multiple-phased project to remove three legacy drum piles
    created during early oil and gas exploration in the Cook Inlet area of Alaska.
    Through rigorous planning and coordination, roughly 10% of the total drums were
    safely removed from the extremely remote project site. The project team is developing
    an updated plan for next field season to remove additional drums and underlying
    residual contamination.'
