objective: 'EPA is establishing and implementing a program to assist Alaska tribal
  entities with addressing contamination on lands conveyed pursuant to the Alaska
  Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.). Contaminated Lands
  are those lands conveyed by the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management,
  to Village and Regional Alaska Native Corporations pursuant to ANCSA that, prior
  to conveyance, were contaminated by the prior federal owner of those lands and/or
  by agents acting on behalf of the federal government and are on an inventory of
  such lands developed and maintained by EPA. ANCSA funds may be used to supplement
  other funds EPA provides to eligible recipients.


  The objectives of ANCSA Contaminated Lands Assistance Agreements are to provide
  funding: (1) to characterize, assess, and conduct planning and community involvement
  activities related to these lands; and (2) to carry out cleanup activities at ANCSA
  contaminated sites.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Funding will support at least three (3) cooperative
  agreements (estimated $600,000 in total) that recipients may use to characterize
  sites and conduct detailed site assessments. Funding will also support at least
  three (3) cooperative agreements (estimated $3 million in total) to enable eligible
  entities to begin cleanup of properties.'
