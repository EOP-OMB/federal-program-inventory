objective: FSA provides emergency loans to help producers recover from production
  and physical losses due to drought, flooding, other natural disasters, or quarantine.
  The emergency loan program is designed to assist farming operations by improving
  their financial viability which will allow them to return to private sources of
  credit as soon as possible.
