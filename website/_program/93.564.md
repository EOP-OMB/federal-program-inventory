objective: This program provides federal funds for experimental, pilot, or demonstration
  projects that are likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Section 1115,
  Part D of Title IV  of the Social Security Act, which stipulates that "the project
  - 1) must be designed to improve the financial well-being of children or otherwise
  improve the operation of the child support program; 2) may not permit modifications
  in the child support program which would have the effect of disadvantaging children
  in need of support; and 3) must not result in increased cost to the federal government
  under Part A of such title.  Any responsibility to the federal government is a condition
  for receiving the grant, but not a principal purpose."
