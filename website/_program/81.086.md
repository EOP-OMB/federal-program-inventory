objective: The goal of this program is to conduct a balanced, long-term research effort
  in Buildings Technologies, Vehicle Technologies, Solid State Lighting Technologies,
  Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies, and Industrial Efficiency and
  Decarbonization. Grants and cooperative agreements will be offered on a competitive
  basis to develop and transfer various energy conservation technologies to the non-federal
  sector. Submission deadlines will be published in specific Notices of Funding Opportunities
  on EERE Exchange at https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/. Notices of Funding Opportunities
  (NOFOs) are also posted at the grants.gov website at http://www.grants.gov.

- description: 'Through AMO’s public-private R&D consortia, manufacturers, small businesses,
    universities, national laboratories, and state and local governments are brought
    together to pursue coordinated early-stage R&D in high-priority areas essential
    to energy in manufacturing. The consortia – while having distinct technology focus
    areas - work towards a common goal: to secure America’s future through manufacturing
    innovation, education, and collaboration. Federal funding is the catalyst to bring
    stakeholders into shared spaces and to address process and technological challenges,
    that present a significant degree of scientific or technical uncertainty. Participants
    in the R&D Consortia gain access to collaborative communities, expertise, and
    physical and virtual tools to foster innovation of promising technologies.


    Additionally, our five institutes are part of Manufacturing USA, a network of
    regional institutes that each have a specialized technology focus. These institutes
    facilitate the transition of innovative advanced materials, information, and process
    technologies to industry by enabling manufacturing scale-up and helping to develop
    national capabilities that enable future global leadership and workforce development
    in advanced manufacturing.
