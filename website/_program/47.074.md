objective: 'To promote the progress of the biological sciences and thereby strengthen
  the Nation''s scientific enterprise; to increase scientific knowledge and enhance
  understanding of major problems confronting the Nation. Most of the research supported
  is basic in character. The program includes support of research project grants in
  the following disciplines: molecular and cellular biosciences; integrative organismal
  biology; environmental biology; and biological infrastructure. Support is also provided
  for the purchase of multi-user scientific equipment and instrument development,
  and for research workshops, symposia, and conferences. In addition, awards are made
  to support graduate student research across biological sciences, postdoctoral fellowships
  in research, and postdoctoral fellowships to scientists of groups under-represented
  in all areas of research supported by the biological sciences.'
