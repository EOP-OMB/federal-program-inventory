  \ quality and \nthe natural resource base upon which the agriculture economy depends;\
  \ make the most efficient \nuse of non-renewable and on farm resources and integrate,\
  \ where appropriate, natural biological \ncycles and controls; sustain the economic\
  \ viability of farm and ranch operations; and enhance the \nquality of life for\
  \ farmers and ranchers and society as a whole."
