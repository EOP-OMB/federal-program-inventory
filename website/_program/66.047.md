objective: 'Section 60109(a)(3) of the Inflation Reduction Act provided EPA with $15
  million for competitive grants for “reclaim and innovative destruction technologies”
  consistent with subsections (a) through (i) and subsection (k) of section 103 division
  S of Public Law 116-260 (also known as the American Innovation and Manufacturing
  Act). Enacted in 2020, the American Manufacturing and Innovation (AIM) Act authorizes
  EPA to address climate-damaging greenhouse gases called Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
  by: phasing down their production and consumption, maximizing reclamation and minimizing
  releases from equipment, and facilitating the transition to next-generation technologies
  through sector-based restrictions on HFCs. For more information on the AIM Act and
  its implementing regulations, please visit https://www.epa.gov/climate-hfcs-reduction.
  The objectives of these grants are to support and contribute to addressing HFCs
  under the AIM Act by funding three project areas: (1) Reclaim Technologies - pilot
  projects or proofs of concept for new/better technologies to increase the reclamation
  of HFCs by expanding access to reclamation and improving the reclamation process;
  (2) Reclaim Market Dynamics - programs or pilot projects for innovative strategies
  that address market dynamics to increase HFC reclamation by lowering barriers; and
  (3) Innovative Destruction Technologies - pilot projects/proof of concept for innovative
  technologies or innovative deployment of technologies to destroy unusable and unwanted
  HFCs. Successful implementation of these funds by grantees will result in the advancement
  of improved technologies and/or deployment of technologies for HFC reclamation and
  destruction and identification of successful mechanisms to address barriers to HFC
  reclamation. In addition, successful projects will thoughtfully engage with, provide
  benefits to, and mitigate any potential negative impacts to low income and disadvantaged
  communities in project design and implementation. Finally, any projects that propose
  to build fixed infrastructure will have to comply with the Build America Buy America
  Act requirements.'
