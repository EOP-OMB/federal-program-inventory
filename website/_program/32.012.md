objective: As broadband connectivity and Internet access have become essential for
  K-12 students and adults, the security and safety of networks and data has become
  of vital importance. Although broadband connectivity and Internet access can simplify
  and enhance the education and daily lives of K-12 students, school staff, and library
  patrons, they can also be used by malicious actors to steal personal information,
  compromise online accounts, and cause online personal harm or embarrassment. In
  response to the growing importance of cybersecurity to broadband connectivity and
  Internet access for K-12 schools and libraries, and in light of the increase in
  cyberattacks to disrupt or disable these critical networks, the Federal Communications
  Commission (Commission or FCC) established the Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity
  pilot program (Pilot or Pilot Program), a three-year pilot program within the Universal
  Service Fund (USF or Fund) to provide up to $200 million to defray the costs of
  eligible cybersecurity services and equipment for schools, libraries, and consortia
  of schools and libraries. Eligible schools, libraries, and consortia comprised of
  schools and libraries selected to participate in the Pilot Program may request and
  receive support through the Pilot Program to purchase a wide range of eligible cybersecurity
  services and equipment that best suit their particular needs, subject to budget
  ceilings, budget floors and per-student and per-library multipliers.  During this
  short-term Pilot Program, the Commission will gather key data on the types of cybersecurity
  services and equipment that K-12 schools and libraries need to protect their broadband
  networks and data, and ensure that students, school staff, and library patrons are
  able to connect to advanced communications that are integral to education. Data
  and information collected through this Pilot Program may also aid in the considerations
  of broader efforts across the government to help schools and libraries address their
  cybersecurity concerns.
