objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code provides
  for $15 billion of tax-exempt bond authority to finance qualified highway or surface
  freight transfer facilities.
