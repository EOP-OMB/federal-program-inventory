objective: 'The Provider Relief Fund supports eligible health care providers in the
  battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Funds are available to prevent, prepare for,
  and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally, for necessary expenses
  to reimburse, through grants or other mechanisms, eligible health care providers
  for health care-related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus.  Eligible
  providers of health care, services, and support may receive Provider Relief Fund
  payments for health care-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to coronavirus.


  In addition to the Provider Relief Fund, $8.5 billion was appropriated as part of
  the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 for payments to rural providers or suppliers
  for health care-related expenses and lost revenues attributable to coronavirus.


  With the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and related rescission
  of program funds, HRSA will not obligate additional funds for payments under the
  Provider Relief Fund or the American Rescue Plan Rural Distribution. Per the Terms
  and Conditions of each Program, all reporting and auditing requirements will continue
  without disruption.'
