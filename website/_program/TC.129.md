objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. In contrast, current law provides a credit equal to
  12.5 to 25 percent of wages paid to qualifying employees while on family and medical
  leave for up to 12 weeks per year. In order to qualify for the credit, an employer
  must have a written policy in place that provides at least two weeks of paid family
  and medical leave per year for full-time workers; additionally, employers must pay
  at least 50 percent of an employeeâ€™s normal wages while they are on paid leave.
