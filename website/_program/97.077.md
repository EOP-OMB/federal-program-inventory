objective: 'Support the PPD-8 objective of prevention related to terrorist acts involving
  nuclear or radiological materials, or weapons using these materials.  Support basic
  research to enhance national security''s capability to detect and prevent the illicit
  entry, transport, assembly, or potential use within the United States of unauthorized
  chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) materials, devices or agents
  and otherwise help protect against an attack using such materials, devices, or agents.  The
  Academic Research Initiative (ARI) Program has two primary objectives: 1) Engage
  the academic community to advance fundamental knowledge for CBRN sciences applicable
  to countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) with emphasis on fundamental research
  to solve long-term, high-risk challenges and 2) develop human capital for the CBRN
  science and engineering professions.  Further, the program works to sustain a long-term
  commitment to basic research in this field and coordinates research efforts across
  the federal government to develop new capabilities for WMD threat detection.'
