    DHS CWMD Academic Research Initiative (ARI) FY20 Accomplishments\n\n•\tCarnegie\
    \ Mellon University: Threat Detection at Checkpoints Modeling\no\tThe team implemented\
    \ a prototype system for characterizing passing conveyances using computer vision\
    \ algorithms for detection and tracking of vehicles in video.  An initial set\
    \ of detection and classification results from traffic data collection was obtained.\
    \  The team will continue efforts to develop new approaches to improve the effectiveness\
    \ of radiation portal monitors for threat detection at checkpoints.\n\n•\tUniversity\
    \ of Michigan: Fast Neutron Detectors for Active Interrogation\no\tThe program\
    \ is transitioning firmware to a board-ready version for hardware implementation.\
    \ Neural network-based pile-up recovery was demonstrated successfully in an interrogation\
    \ environment, and results were verified by simulation, activation analysis, and\
    \ conventional detection methods. This work will lead to laboratory demonstrations\
    \ of shielded SNM detection with neutron signals in a high-intensity photon interrogation\
    \ environment.\n\n•\tUniversity of Tennessee: IDEAS for SNM\no\tThe radiation\
    \ hardness of LKH5 scintillating glass was characterized, and samples were coupled\
    \ to commercially available silicon thin film transistor arrays. These arrays\
    \ were shown to have better radiography performance than CdWO4.\n\n•\tYale University:\
    \ Active Interrogation with Superheated Emulsions:\no\tThe team has developed\
    \ large, uniform-droplet superheated emulsion detectors with an optical readout\
    \ to detect neutrons in an active interrogation environment. The next phase of\
    \ development will involve laboratory testing of the detectors in a field-representative\
    \ active interrogation scenario.\n\n•\tUniversity of California-Berkeley: Enhanced\
    \ Search by Fusing Radiological and Non-Radiological Sources\no\tThe team continued\
    \ integration of mobile radiation search system and object tracking approach into\
    \ data fusion capability is underway.  The team will complete algorithm integration\
    \ into the data fusion system to support anomaly detection by end of FY21, providing\
    \ improved capability for wide area nuclear search and monitoring.  Preliminary\
    \ analysis indicates contextual information can improve detection capabilities\
    \ and provides critical attribution capabilities.  Object tracking and data fusion\
    \ are ongoing efforts.  Lidar enhancements have improved contextual sensor data\
    \ when synchronized.\n\n•\tUniversity of Tennessee: Methylammonium Lead Halide\
    \ Scintillators\no\tEfforts focused on optimization of the growth parameters to\
    \ enhance the electronic properties of perovskites relevant to radiation sensing.\
    \ Growth techniques included modifications of precursor ratios and concentrations,\
    \ heating/cooling rates, and incorporation of substitutional elements such as\
    \ lithium, cesium, and chlorine. The team made significant progress in optimizing\
    \ growth processes for different HOIP variants. Incorporation of different anions\
    \ and cations to improve performance, to include the addition of lithium for thermal\
    \ neutron sensing was made. Funding also supported a new graduate level course,\
    \ NE 597/697 “Topics of Semiconductor Detectors,” which was taught by the PI during\
    \ this period.\n\n•\tUniversity of Utah: Machine Learning of Nuclear Forensic\
    \ Data\no\tDemonstrated that new image classification technique resulted in higher\
    \ predictive average value.  This supports ongoing work in evaluating the feasibility\
    \ of using machine learning for image analysis of forensics samples, to reduce\
    \ the data processing time through automated assessment of sample images and identifying\
    \ crucial trends in large data sets. A PhD student on this project received an\
    \ Innovations in Nuclear Technology R&D Award from the Department of Energy’s\
    \ Office of Nuclear Technology R&D. \n\n•\tSouthern Methodist University: Radiation\
    \ Background Characterization for Anomaly Detection\no\tMeasurements on the Aviation\
    \ Pathway continued with an additional 38 flight segments on passenger and 65\
    \ on cargo aircraft completed.  Passenger flights utilized passengers carrying\
    \ Kromek DS3 detectors in “airplane” mode while cargo flights utilized FEDEX shipments.\
    \  Results showed that altitude is the dominant effect on background at airline\
    \ and cargo altitudes, with geomagnetic latitude as the second most important\
    \ effect (greater effect at lower latitudes).  The team also demonstrated the\
    \ ability to predict count rate given altitude and geomagnetic latitude.\n\n•\t\
    George Mason University: Surveying Ingress Pathways for Energetic Radiation Background\n\
    o\tThe team continued work to combine advanced radiation detector systems and\
    \ platforms with robust mobile ad-hoc network connectivity and advanced machine\
    \ learning algorithms to quantify background signatures and enhance real-time\
    \ anomaly detection. During FY20, the testbed was expanded to include at least\
    \ one mobile platform to determine impact on anomaly detection. The team determined\
    \ the threshold for anomaly detection for machine learning algorithm for a fixed\
    \ network and fixed source.  Finally, the team developed a background radiation\
    \ simulation module for planning tool; and down selected to best II-VI and oxide-based\
    \ p-and n-thin film semiconductor to be used in p-i-n photodiode structure, and\
    \ evaluated a silicon diode / scintillator element using 60Co source and standard\
    \ nuclear counting electronics.\n\n•\tCarnegie Mellon University: Robust Interpretable\
    \ Anomaly Detection for CWMD\no\tThis project examines multiple approaches for\
    \ anomaly detection in radiation measurements, scoring that describes which anomalies\
    \ are of most importance, combining disparate data sources such as manifest with\
    \ radiation portal monitor, and explainability of the output of machine learning.\
    \  Each of these subjects was advanced in FY20. \no\tThe Spectral Anomaly Detection\
    \ algorithm was improved by requiring structured deviations across multiple observations.\
    \ This improved anomaly detection while retaining low false positive rates.\n\
    o\tAutomatic scoring of anomalies was developed with consideration of the Enhanced\
    \ Radiological Nuclear Inspection and Evaluation (ERNIE) application used on radiation\
    \ portal monitors.  Scoring was developed that focuses on threat anomalies rather\
    \ than the many other anomalies that may be generated from benign variations.\n\
    \n•\tUniversity of Tennessee: Multimodal Data Fusion for Anomaly Detection\no\t\
    Anomaly detection code was run on a virtual single board computer to assess the\
    \ ultimate resource requirements for field deployment.\no\tEntered final version\
    \ of Autoencoder Radiation Anomaly Detector (ARAD) into secure the code repository\
    \ at UTK.\no\tThe PhD student involved in ARAD development graduated in FY20 and\
    \ moved to a team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In the intervening months,\
    \ he has become an essential part of a technology evaluation team at ORNL working\
    \ on a CWMD Advanced Technology Demonstration for wearable radiation detectors.\n\
    \nExploratory Research (ER) Program\nThe ER Program specifically focused on innovative,\
    \ high risk, early-stage applied research expected to have transformational impact,\
    \ and when conducted with a clear and well supported technical approach, would\
    \ provide new capabilities to help counter the threat of nuclear terrorism.  Research\
    \ under this Program culminated in a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstration, to\
    \ support transitioning to an advanced technology demonstration program or supporting\
    \ direct commercialization of the technology.\n\nFinal Exploratory Research project\
    \ (Carnegie Mellon Univeristy), completed 8/31/2020\no\tThe team completed feasibility\
    \ evaluation into development of an algorithmic framework for aggregating data\
    \ from multiple sensing modalities on vehicle platforms to reliably monitor, detect,\
    \ localize, track, and characterize radiological/nuclear threats in real time\
    \ in cluttered scenes such as urban traffic scenarios."
