objective: "Funding under this program supports competitive grants to institutions\
  \ of higher education (IHEs) (as defined under section 101(a) of the Higher Education\
  \ Act of 1965, as amended (HEA)), or consortia of IHEs, to create or expand high-quality,\
  \ inclusive model comprehensive transition and postsecondary programs for students\
  \ with intellectual disabilities. Under section 767(d)(6) of the HEA all grant recipients\
  \ must partner with one or more local educational agencies (LEAs) to support students\
  \ with intellectual disabilities who are still eligible for special education and\
  \ related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\r\
  \nFunds from this program also support a national Coordinating Center (Coordinating\
  \ Center), which develops evaluation standards for TPSID grantees and provides technical\
  \ assistance, information, and opportunities for communication among institutions\
  \ with postsecondary programs for students with intellectual disabilities. The Center\
  \ assists in supporting continuous improvement activities for the model transition\
  \ programs. The Coordinating Center will:\r\n(A) provide a research and evaluation\
  \ protocol for TPSID programs; \r\n(B) administer a mentoring program matching current\
  \ and new TPSID grantees based on areas of expertise; \r\n(C) coordinate longitudinal\
  \ follow-up data collection and technical assistance to TPSID grantees on programmatic\
  \ components and evidence-based practices; \r\n(D) make recommendations related\
  \ to the development of standards for such programs; \r\n(E) provide technical assistance\
  \ and evaluations for such programs. \r\n"
