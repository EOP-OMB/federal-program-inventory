objective: The New Freedom program (Section 5317) provided grants for new capital
  and operating projects aimed at reducing, beyond the requirements of the Americans
  with Disabilities Act of 1990, transportation barriers faced by individuals with
  disabilities to expand mobility through transportation, including transportation
  to and from jobs and employment support services. The New Freedom Program was repealed
  under MAP-21; however, New Freedom type projects are eligible for funding under
  the new Section 5310 Program (Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with
  Disabilities Program â€“ Circular FTA C 9070.1G).
