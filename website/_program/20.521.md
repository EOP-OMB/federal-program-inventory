objective: "The New Freedom program (Section 5317) provided grants for new capital\

  \ with Disabilities Act of 1990, transportation barriers faced by individuals with\
  \ disabilities to expand mobility through transportation, including transportation\
  \ to and from jobs and employment support services. The New Freedom Program was\
  \ repealed under MAP-21; however, New Freedom type projects are eligible for funding\
  \ under the new Section 5310 Program (Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals\
  \ with Disabilities Program \u2013 Circular FTA C 9070.1G)."
