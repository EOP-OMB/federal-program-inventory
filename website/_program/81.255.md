objective: "The mission of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) is to\
  \ deliver clean energy demonstration projects at scale in partnership with the private\
  \ sector to accelerate \ndeployment, market adoption, and the equitable transition\
  \ to a decarbonized energy system.\n\nOCED is a multi-technology office with demonstrations\
  \ that include clean hydrogen, carbon management, industrial decarbonization, advanced\
  \ nuclear reactors, long-duration energy storage, demonstration projects in rural\
  \ or remote areas and on current and former mine land, and more. \n\nThe technologies\
  \ in OCED’s portfolio face significant barriers to scale. OCED’s role is to address\
  \ these barriers and help de-risk them. Central to OCED’s approach is consistent\
  \ engagement with a wide range of stakeholders \nand pursuit of projects that advance\
  \ an equitable transition by providing benefits to communities across America.\n\
  \nMost of OCED’s projects are structured as collaborative partnerships that use\
  \ cost share agreements. OCED will provide up to 50 percent of the funding in its\
  \ public-private partnerships, assisting its industry partners with the early steps\
  \ to commercialization and deployment."
