objective: "The mission of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) is to\
  \ deliver clean energy demonstration projects at scale in partnership with the private\
  \ sector to accelerate \ndeployment, market adoption, and the equitable transition\
  \ to a decarbonized energy system.\n\nOCED is a multi-technology office with demonstrations\
  \ that include clean hydrogen, carbon management, industrial decarbonization, advanced\
  \ nuclear reactors, long-duration energy storage, demonstration projects in rural\
  \ or remote areas and on current and former mine land, and more. \n\nThe technologies\
  \ in OCED\u2019s portfolio face significant barriers to scale. OCED\u2019s role\
  \ is to address these barriers and help de-risk them. Central to OCED\u2019s approach\
  \ is consistent engagement with a wide range of stakeholders \nand pursuit of projects\
  \ that advance an equitable transition by providing benefits to communities across\
  \ America.\n\nMost of OCED\u2019s projects are structured as collaborative partnerships\
  \ that use cost share agreements. OCED will provide up to 50 percent of the funding\
  \ in its public-private partnerships, assisting its industry partners with the early\
  \ steps to commercialization and deployment."
