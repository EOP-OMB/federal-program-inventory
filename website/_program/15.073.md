objective: "The primary purpose of the Earth Mapping Resources Initiative is to facilitate\
  \ new geological and geochemical mapping activities, new geophysical data collection\
  \ (and obtain associated datasets), and new mine waste research and data gathering/acquisition\
  \ as part of a larger initiative to collect geophysical, geologic, and topographic\
  \ data in areas of critical mineral potential across the Nation. This effort supports\
  \ Executive Order 13817 (\"A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies\
  \ of Critical Minerals\"). In order to respond to this Executive Order, the US Geological\
  \ Survey (USGS) established this initiative to support advanced mapping of the geologic\
  \ resources of the Nation - with the USGS designated as the lead Federal agency\
  \ for geologic map data. Additionally, as of FY2022, Earth MRI is now mandated by\
  \ the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (PL 117-58, signed on 11/15/21) - directing\
  \ the USGS to accelerate efforts to carry out fundamental integrated topographic,\
  \ geologic, geochemical, and geophysical mapping activities \u2013 as well as mine\
  \ waste research and data gathering - all focused on the assessment of critical\
  \ minerals. This advanced geologic mapping and airborne geophysics has the potential\
  \ to significantly close the gap in the essential data needed to enhance economic\
  \ development and technological innovation, while advancing our understanding of\
  \ the fundamental ways that geology informs public policy and every aspect of daily\
  \ life."
