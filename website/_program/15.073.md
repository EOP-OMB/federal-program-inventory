objective: The primary purpose of the Earth Mapping Resources Initiative is to facilitate
  new geological and geochemical mapping activities, new geophysical data collection
  (and obtain associated datasets), and new mine waste research and data gathering/acquisition
  as part of a larger initiative to collect geophysical, geologic, and topographic
  data in areas of critical mineral potential across the Nation. This effort supports
  Executive Order 13817 ("A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies
  of Critical Minerals"). In order to respond to this Executive Order, the US Geological
  Survey (USGS) established this initiative to support advanced mapping of the geologic
  resources of the Nation - with the USGS designated as the lead Federal agency for
  geologic map data. Additionally, as of FY2022, Earth MRI is now mandated by the
  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (PL 117-58, signed on 11/15/21) - directing
  the USGS to accelerate efforts to carry out fundamental integrated topographic,
  geologic, geochemical, and geophysical mapping activities â€“ as well as mine waste
  research and data gathering - all focused on the assessment of critical minerals.
  This advanced geologic mapping and airborne geophysics has the potential to significantly
  close the gap in the essential data needed to enhance economic development and technological
  innovation, while advancing our understanding of the fundamental ways that geology
  informs public policy and every aspect of daily life.
