objective: LFP provides compensation to eligible livestock producers that have suffered
  grazing losses for covered livestock on land that is native or improved pastureland
  with permanent vegetative cover or is planted specifically for grazing. It also
  provides compensation to eligible livestock producers that have suffered grazing
  losses on rangeland managed by a federal agency if the eligible livestock producer
  is prohibited by the federal agency from grazing the normal permitted livestock
  on the managed rangeland due to a qualifying fire.
