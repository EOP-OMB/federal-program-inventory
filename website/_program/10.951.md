objective: The mission of the National Agricultural Statistics Agency (NASS) is to
  provide timely, accurate, and useful statistics in service to the U.S. agriculture
  economy. The statistical data provided by NASS is essential to the public and private
  sectors for making effective policy, production, and marketing decisions on a wide
  range of agricultural commodities. The statistical data provided in NASS studies
  and reports is necessary to maintain an objective source to ensure commodity markets
  operate fairly and efficiently. Every 5 years the Census of Agriculture provides
  comprehensive national, State, and county data as well as selected data for Puerto
  Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands. Formulate, develop,
  and administer programs for collecting and publishing statistics related to agriculture,
  resources, and rural communities. Assist rural communities to create prosperity
  so they are self sustaining, repopulating and economically thriving. Ensure our
  national forests and private working lands are conserved, restored, and made more
  resilient to climate change, while enhancing our water resources. To ensure that
  all of America's children have access to safe, nutritious and balanced meals.
