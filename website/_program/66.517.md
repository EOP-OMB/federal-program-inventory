objective: 'The RARE program provides the EPA Regional offices with a mechanism to
  fund innovative research partnerships to support near term research. RARE projects
  address a wide array of environmental science issues critical to the Office of Research
  and Development’s regional partner communities and address regional and national
  research priorities. Funding Priority 2023: EPA does not expect to support awards
  under this program in FY 23.'

- description: 1) The technology implemented by the project team at a refinery in
    South Philadelphia, provided a cost-effective and low-intensity approach to monitoring
    the release of benzene at the fence-line. The results of this project were made
    publicly available and addressed the concerns of South Philadelphia communities
    close to one of the largest sources of hazardous air pollutants in the city. 2)
    With funding provided by RARE and Region 2, ORD developed a citizen science air
    monitor (CSAM) that is low-cost, portable, and could be successfully used by the
    Ironbound community of Newark, NJ to examine local levels of nitrogen dioxide
    and fine particulate matter, two pollutants of particular interest to the community.
    During the approximately six months that the units were deployed, community volunteers
    were able to gather air quality data from over 20 sites throughout the community.
    The collaborative project enabled residents to learn more about local air quality
    and how local pollutant sources can impact it. The project has also resulted in
    the development of new resources to enable EPA to better support citizen science
    air monitoring projects including ORD's Air Sensor Toolbox that provides valuable
    information on how communities can utilize the next generation of air monitoring
    equipment to investigate their local air quality. ORD and Region 2 are now evaluating
    a new generation of smaller and lighter air monitors in Pe񵥬as, Puerto Rico to
    evaluate the performance of the CSAM units in tropical climates. 3)Two funded
    RARE projects permitted the installation and demonstration of chlorination and
    filtration techniques that have benefited roughly 300 individuals in the communities
    of La Sofia and Apeadero in rural Puerto Rico that are not owned nor administered
    by Puerto Rico's Aquaduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA). In an effort to protect
    human health and reduce the potential for waterborne disease, ORD has, since 2005,
    conducted research on the development of low-cost and easy-to-maintain filtration
    and disinfection technologies appropriate for non-PRASA communities.
