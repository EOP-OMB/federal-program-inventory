objective: "The grant program funds activities to reduce lead in drinking water in\
  \ disadvantaged communities through infrastructure and/or treatment improvements\
  \ or facility remediation in schools and child care facilities. The goal of the\
  \ program is to address conditions that contribute to increased concentrations of\
  \ lead in drinking water.  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Priority is given\
  \ to projects that focus on reducing lead exposure in disadvantaged communities\
  \ served by drinking water systems with at least one lead action level exceedance\
  \ within the last three years, in schools, daycares, and/or other facilities that\
  \ primarily serve children or other populations vulnerable to environmental health\
  \ risks. \n\nFunding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2024: Priority is given to projects\
  \ that focus on reducing lead exposure in disadvantaged communities served by drinking\
