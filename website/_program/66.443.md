objective: The grant program funds activities to reduce lead in drinking water in
  disadvantaged communities through infrastructure and/or treatment improvements or
  facility remediation in schools and child care facilities. The goal of the program
  is to address conditions that contribute to increased concentrations of lead in
  drinking water. Priority is given to projects that focus on reducing lead exposure
  in disadvantaged communities served by drinking water systems with at least one
  lead action level exceedance within the last three years, in schools, daycares,
  and/or other facilities that primarily serve children or other populations vulnerable
  to environmental health risks.
