objective: 'The purpose of the Innovation Fund program is to fund efforts that accelerate
  the development, deployment, and adoption of open and interoperable radio access
  networks (RAN) through a competitive grant program. In response to this first NOFO,
  NTIA looks forward to receiving and reviewing a broad range of applications proposing
  creative ways to: (1) expand testing and evaluation (T&E) activities to effectively
  facilitate and assess the interoperability, performance, and/or security of open
  and interoperable, standards-based 5G networks; and (2) develop new and/or materially
  improve existing testing methodologies to test, evaluate, and validate the performance,
  interoperability, and security of these networks and their component parts.'
