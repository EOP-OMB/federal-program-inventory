objective: The U.S. Coast Guard supports the recreational boating safety community
  by funding three grant programs that encourage greater participation and uniformity
  in boating safety; to reduce the number of accidents, injuries, and deaths on domestic
  waterways; to permit states, territories, and/or nonprofit organizations to assume
  the greater share of boating safety education, assistance, and enforcement activities;
  to assist states, territories, and/or nonprofit organizations in developing, carrying
  out, and financing their recreational boating safety programs; and to gather important
  information and data regarding the boating community, the number and different types
  of boats operated domestically, and how many hours are spent operating on the water.
