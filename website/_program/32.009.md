objective: In section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan Act (Act), Congress established
  a $7.171 billion Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) in the U.S. Treasury and directed
  the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) not later than 60 days
  after enactment of the Act to promulgate rules providing for the distribution of
  ECF support to eligible schools and libraries for the purchase of eligible equipment
  and/or advanced telecommunications and information services for use by students,
  school staff, and library patrons at locations including locations other than a
  school or library. On May 10, 2021, the FCC adopted a Report and Order entitled
  Establishing the Emergency Connectivity Fund to Close the Homework Gap, WC Docket
  No. 21-93, Report and Order, FCC 21-58 (2021) (Report and Order). The Report and
  Order established the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program (ECF Program), which is
  funded through the ECF. The ECF Program rules became effective upon publication
  of the Report and Order in the Federal Register on May 28, 2021. ECF Program support
  was first made available to eligible schools and libraries applying for funds for
  the purchases of eligible equipment, including Wi-Fi hotspots, modems, routers,
  and connected devices, as well as advanced telecommunications and information services,
  to meet the remote learning needs of students, school staff, and library patrons
  who would otherwise lack access to connected devices and/or broadband connections
  sufficient to engage in remote learning during the 2021-2022 school year.  On April
  28, 2022, the FCC opened the third and final application filing window, during which
  eligible schools and libraries were able to submit requests for funding to purchase
  eligible equipment and up to 12 months of recurring services to be provided between
  July 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023 for students, school staff, and library patrons
  with unmet needs.  Because demand exceeded available funds, applications received
  during the third filing window will be prioritized to fund schools and libraries
  with the greatest need first, with a preference for schools and libraries located
  in rural areas pursuant to the Commission’s rules.
