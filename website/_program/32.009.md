objective: "In section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan Act (Act), Congress established\
  \ a $7.171 billion Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) in the U.S. Treasury and directed\
  \ the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) not later than 60 days\
  \ after enactment of the Act to promulgate rules providing for the distribution\
  \ of ECF support to eligible schools and libraries for the purchase of eligible\
  \ equipment and/or advanced telecommunications and information services for use\
  \ by students, school staff, and library patrons at locations including locations\
  \ other than a school or library. On May 10, 2021, the FCC adopted a Report and\
  \ Order entitled Establishing the Emergency Connectivity Fund to Close the Homework\
  \ Gap, WC Docket No. 21-93, Report and Order, FCC 21-58 (2021) (Report and Order).\
  \ The Report and Order established the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program (ECF\
  \ Program), which is funded through the ECF. The ECF Program rules became effective\
  \ upon publication of the Report and Order in the Federal Register on May 28, 2021.\
  \ ECF Program support was first made available to eligible schools and libraries\
  \ applying for funds for the purchases of eligible equipment, including Wi-Fi hotspots,\
  \ modems, routers, and connected devices, as well as advanced telecommunications\
  \ and information services, to meet the remote learning needs of students, school\
  \ staff, and library patrons who would otherwise lack access to connected devices\
  \ and/or broadband connections sufficient to engage in remote learning during the\
  \ 2021-2022 school year.  On April 28, 2022, the FCC opened the third and final\
  \ application filing window, during which eligible schools and libraries were able\
  \ to submit requests for funding to purchase eligible equipment and up to 12 months\
  \ of recurring services to be provided between July 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023\
  \ for students, school staff, and library patrons with unmet needs.  Because demand\
  \ exceeded available funds, applications received during the third filing window\
  \ will be prioritized to fund schools and libraries with the greatest need first,\
  \ with a preference for schools and libraries located in rural areas pursuant to\
  \ the Commission\u2019s rules."
