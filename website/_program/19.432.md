objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators. ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is\
  \ premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future\
  \ leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect\
  \ official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today. ECA programs inform,\
  \ engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society \u2013\
  \ including young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals\
  \ \u2013 increasing the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience\
  \ with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule\
  \ of law, economic choice, and individual dignity while building international knowledge\
  \ and capacity among Americans. The EducationUSA network promotes U.S. higher education\
  \ and facilitates student mobility by providing guidance and support to both prospective\
  \ student audiences abroad and U.S. higher education institutions that seek to recruit\
  \ and enroll these students.  EducationUSA also supports both international and\
  \ domestic student success by research by engaging U.S. higher education institutions\
  \ to ensure that students' experiences on U.S. campuses are academically engaging,\
  \ culturally enriching, include diverse, global perspectives in the classroom, and\
  \ create lasting ties between individuals today that will support stronger relations\
  \ between nations tomorrow.  The U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational\
  \ and Cultural Affairs (ECA) oversees the EducationUSA network, which consists of\
  \ over 430 international student advising centers in more than 175 countries worldwide.\
  \ The EducationUSA network supports ECA\u2019s mission by increasing international\
  \ student mobility, providing students from across the globe with access to educational\
  \ opportunities, and building a broader understanding of the U.S. higher education\
  \ sector among overseas student, government and academic personnel. EducationUSA\
  \ advising centers are housed within U.S. embassies and consulates and/or in partner\
  \ institutions that include Fulbright Commissions, bi-national cultural centers,\
  \ U.S. non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international NGOs, and/or universities\
  \ and libraries abroad. EducationUSA advisers provide guidance and support to international\
  \ students and their families as they explore opportunities to study at U.S. college\
  \ and universities. EducationUSA advisers provide guidance on the U.S. higher education\
  \ admissions process and offer accurate, comprehensive, and current information\
  \ about the full range of accredited U.S. institutions of higher education. Advising\
  \ activities are conducted via center activities, in-person and virtual outreach\
  \ in local communities, including webinars, virtual recruitment fairs, and website\
  \ content. Through programs like the EducationUSA Academy and Leadership Institutes,\
  \ EducationUSA seeks to develop a pipeline of college-ready international students\
  \ at the secondary level and expand the capacity of colleges and universities in\
  \ the United States to partner with overseas institutions around student and scholar\
  \ exchange, collaborative research, and workforce development initiatives. ECA\u2019\
  s EducationUSA branch also funds the annual Open Doors Report on International Educational\
  \ Exchange which tracks the flow of students to and from of the United States and\
  \ provides essential data used in calculating the economic impact of inbound international\
  \ student mobility."
