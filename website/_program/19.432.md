objective: As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and
  Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people
  of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and
  cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals,
  students, and educators. ECA programs foster engagement and encourage dialogue with
  citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is premised on the
  knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future leaders, and the
  benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making
  almost everywhere in the world today. ECA programs inform, engage, and influence
  participants across strategic sectors of society – including young people, women,
  teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals – increasing the number
  of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience with Americans and with the
  values of freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic choice, and
  individual dignity while building international knowledge and capacity among Americans.
  The EducationUSA network promotes U.S. higher education and facilitates student
  mobility by providing guidance and support to both prospective student audiences
  abroad and U.S. higher education institutions that seek to recruit and enroll these
  students.  EducationUSA also supports both international and domestic student success
  by research by engaging U.S. higher education institutions to ensure that students'
  experiences on U.S. campuses are academically engaging, culturally enriching, include
  diverse, global perspectives in the classroom, and create lasting ties between individuals
  today that will support stronger relations between nations tomorrow.  The U.S. Department
  of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) oversees the EducationUSA
  network, which consists of over 430 international student advising centers in more
  than 175 countries worldwide. The EducationUSA network supports ECA’s mission by
  increasing international student mobility, providing students from across the globe
  with access to educational opportunities, and building a broader understanding of
  the U.S. higher education sector among overseas student, government and academic
  personnel. EducationUSA advising centers are housed within U.S. embassies and consulates
  and/or in partner institutions that include Fulbright Commissions, bi-national cultural
  centers, U.S. non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international NGOs, and/or
  universities and libraries abroad. EducationUSA advisers provide guidance and support
  to international students and their families as they explore opportunities to study
  at U.S. college and universities. EducationUSA advisers provide guidance on the
  U.S. higher education admissions process and offer accurate, comprehensive, and
  current information about the full range of accredited U.S. institutions of higher
  education. Advising activities are conducted via center activities, in-person and
  virtual outreach in local communities, including webinars, virtual recruitment fairs,
  and website content. Through programs like the EducationUSA Academy and Leadership
  Institutes, EducationUSA seeks to develop a pipeline of college-ready international
  students at the secondary level and expand the capacity of colleges and universities
  in the United States to partner with overseas institutions around student and scholar
  exchange, collaborative research, and workforce development initiatives. ECA’s EducationUSA
  branch also funds the annual Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange
  which tracks the flow of students to and from of the United States and provides
  essential data used in calculating the economic impact of inbound international
  student mobility.
