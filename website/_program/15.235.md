objective: "The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA) advances the Department\
  \ of the Interior\u2019s role as stewards of the public lands by cultivating community-based\
  \ conservation and partnerships. This program provides support and guidance for\
  \ carrying out the expenditure of appropriated funds generated from the sale of\
  \ public lands in the valley of Las Vegas, Nevada.  In part, the SNPLMA funds are\
  \ used for the development of Parks, Trails, and Natural Areas in Clark, Lincoln,\
  \ and White Pine counties, and Carson City, all of Nevada; development and implementation\
  \ of a multi-species habitat conservation plan in Clark County; and development\
  \ and implementation of comprehensive, multijurisdictional, cost-effective hazardous\
  \ fuels reduction and wildfire prevention plans in the Lake Tahoe Basin, the Carson\
  \ Range in Douglas and Washoe counties and Carson City, and the Spring Mountains\
  \ of Nevada. The program will focus funded partnerships on key activities in support\
  \ of the Department of the Interior's priorities to address the climate crisis,\
  \ restore balance on public lands and waters, advance environmental justice, strengthening\
  \ the government -to-government relationship with sovereign Tribal Nations, and\
  \ invest in a clean energy future, where there is clear alignment of bureau priorities."
