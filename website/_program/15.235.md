objective: The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA) advances the Department
  of the Interior’s role as stewards of the public lands by cultivating community-based
  conservation and partnerships. This program provides support and guidance for carrying
  out the expenditure of appropriated funds generated from the sale of public lands
  in the valley of Las Vegas, Nevada.  In part, the SNPLMA funds are used for the
  development of Parks, Trails, and Natural Areas in Clark, Lincoln, and White Pine
  counties, and Carson City, all of Nevada; development and implementation of a multi-species
  habitat conservation plan in Clark County; and development and implementation of
  comprehensive, multijurisdictional, cost-effective hazardous fuels reduction and
  wildfire prevention plans in the Lake Tahoe Basin, the Carson Range in Douglas and
  Washoe counties and Carson City, and the Spring Mountains of Nevada. The program
  will focus funded partnerships on key activities in support of the Department of
  the Interior's priorities to address the climate crisis, restore balance on public
  lands and waters, advance environmental justice, strengthening the government -to-government
  relationship with sovereign Tribal Nations, and invest in a clean energy future,
  where there is clear alignment of bureau priorities.
