objective: The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments
  and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In
  contrast, the Tax Code allows an R&E credit of up to 20 percent of qualified research
  expenditures in excess of a base amount. The base amount of the credit is generally
  determined by multiplying a “fixed-base percentage” by the average amount of the
  company’s gross receipts for the prior four years. The taxpayer’s fixed base percentage
  generally is the ratio of its research expenses to gross receipts for 1984 through
  1988. Taxpayers can elect the alternative simplified credit regime, which equals
  14 percent of qualified research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average
  qualified research expenses for the three preceding taxable years.
