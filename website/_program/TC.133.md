objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities
  or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code provides a tax credit
  to qualified small employers that make a certain level of non-elective contributions
  towards the purchase of certain health insurance coverage for its employees. To
  receive a credit, an employer must have fewer than 25 full-time-equivalent employees
  whose average annual full-time-equivalent wages from the employer are less than
  $50,000 (indexed for taxable years after 2013). However, to receive a full credit,
  an employer must have no more than 10 full-time employees, and the average wage
  paid to these employees must be no more than $25,000 (indexed for taxable years
  after 2013). A qualifying employer may claim the credit for any taxable year beginning
  in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 and for up to two years for insurance purchased through
  a Health Insurance Exchange thereafter. For taxable years beginning in 2010, 2011,
  2012, and 2013, the maximum credit is 35 percent of premiums paid by qualified taxable
  employers and 25 percent of premiums paid by qualified tax-exempt organizations.
  For taxable years beginning in 2014 and later years, the maximum tax credit increases
  to 50 percent of premiums paid by qualified taxable employers and 35 percent of
  premiums paid by qualified tax-exempt organizations.
