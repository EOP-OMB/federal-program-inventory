objective: The Title IV-E Prevention Program, enacted as part of Public Law (P.L.)
  115–123, authorized optional title IV-E funding for time-limited prevention services
  for mental health, substance abuse, and in-home parent skill-based programs for
  children or youth who are candidates for foster care, pregnant or parenting youth
  in foster care, and the parents or kin caregivers of those children and youth. These
  services or programs are available when the needs of the child, a parent, or a caregiver
  are directly related to the safety, permanence, or well-being of the child or to
  preventing the child from entering foster care. Services are to be provided to children
  and families without regard to children’s eligibility for title IV-E foster care
  maintenance payments.
