objective: The Title IV-E Prevention Program provides funding for time-limited prevention
  services, including mental health, substance abuse, and in-home parent skill-based
  programs for children or youth who are candidates for foster care, pregnant or parenting
  youth in foster care, and the parents or kin caregivers of those children and youth.
  These services or programs are available when the needs of the child, a parent,
  or a caregiver are directly related to the safety, permanence, or well-being of
  the child or to preventing the child from entering foster care. These services are
  to be provided to children and families without regard to childrenâ€™s eligibility
  for title IV-E foster care maintenance payments.
