objective: The mission of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s)
  RESTORE Science Program is to carry out research, observation, and monitoring to
  support the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem, fish stocks, fish habitat,
  and the recreational, commercial, and charter-fishing industry in the Gulf of Mexico.
  To meet this mission, the Science Program invests in researcher and natural resource
  manage relationships and the coproduction of science to support natural resource
  management decisions in the Gulf. The Science Program is funded by a portion of
  the Clean Water Act penalties from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and authorized
  by the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived
  Economies (RESTORE) of the Gulf States Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-141, Section
  1604).

- description: The RESTORE Act Science Program’s suite of awards from our initial
    funding competition in 2015 are about half way completed and each is making progress
    consistent with their milestones and expected outputs. We will be publicizing
    the outputs and outcomes resulting from our current awards as they near completion
  year: '2016'
- description: The RESTORE Science Program is currently funding 15 teams of researchers
    and resource managers to support work on living coastal and marine resources and
    their habitats in the Gulf of Mexico. Six of the teams will be working directly
    with resource managers to improve the decision support tools available for managing
    living coastal and marine resources in the Gulf. Nine of the teams will be conducting
    research on living coastal and marine resources to address questions resource
    managers need answered about food webs, habitat use, fisheries recruitment, the
    impact of stressors, and how habitats are connected in the Gulf.
