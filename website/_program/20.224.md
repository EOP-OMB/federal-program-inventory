objective: The goal of the Federal Lands Access Program is to improve transportation
  facilities that provide access to, are adjacent to, or are located within Federal
  lands. The Access Program supplements State and local resources for public roads,
  transit systems, and other transportation facilities, with an emphasis on high-use
  recreation sites and economic generators. The program is designed to provide flexibility
  for a wide range of transportation projects in the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
  and Puerto Rico. A Programming Decisions Committee (PDC) within each State will
  make programming decisions and should develop a multi-year program of projects.

results:
- description: The State Route 88 Apache Trail project in Arizona will provide a hardened
    driving surface and address sight distance issues along 11.2 miles of the historic
    route. The project will benefit the community by enhancing recreation access and
    safety. Furthermore, these improvements will dramatically reduce the maintenance
    needs, freeing up these limited resources to serve critical maintenance needs
    in other areas. During project design the site experienced a flood event that
    damaged several culverts that were not a part of the original project. The FHWA-CFLHD
    project team quickly identified an opportunity to reduce administrative costs
    and improve economies of scale, and with assistance from ADOT and the FHWA-AZ
    Division Office, secured emergency relief funds to combine repair work with the
    Access Program project for an overall benefit to the taxpayer. The project involves
    the Emergency Relief funded drainage repairs of pipe culverts and reinforced concrete
    box culverts; and the Access Program funded slope scaling, excavation, chip seal,
    asphalt paving, erosion control, and revegetation.
