objective: The goal of the Federal Lands Access Program is to improve transportation
  facilities that provide access to, are adjacent to, or are located within Federal
  lands. The Access Program supplements State and local resources for public roads,
  transit systems, and other transportation facilities, with an emphasis on high-use
  recreation sites and economic generators. The program is designed to provide flexibility
  for a wide range of transportation projects in the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
  and Puerto Rico. A Programming Decisions Committee (PDC) within each State will
  make programming decisions and should develop a multi-year program of projects.
