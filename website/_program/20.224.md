objective: The goal of the Federal Lands Access Program is to improve transportation
  facilities that provide access to, are adjacent to, or are located within Federal
  lands. The Access Program supplements State and local resources for public roads,
  transit systems, and other transportation facilities, with an emphasis on high-use
  recreation sites and economic generators. The program is designed to provide flexibility
  for a wide range of transportation projects in the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
  and Puerto Rico. A Programming Decisions Committee (PDC) within each State will
  make programming decisions and should develop a multi-year program of projects.

- description: This Arkansas project benefits the Dale Bumpers White River National
    Wildlife Refuge.  The work consists of providing an engineering solution to the
    continued erosion of the roadway embankment along the Big Island Chute, installation
    of low water crossings at three locations where frequent washouts affect vehicular
    access, and select clearing to improve the drainage along portions of the more
    than 5 miles of South CC Camp Rd.  White River National Wildlife Refuge (NWR)
    was established in 1935 and it was renamed Dale Bumpers White River National Wildlife
    Refuge in 2014. It is home to diverse species of trees, woody plants, and animals.
    The South CC Camp Road has been in place in some form since the 1800s and is the
    primary access from Refuge HQ to the Farm Unit. It mainly lies in the floodplain
    of White River, which is located in southeast Arkansas near where the Arkansas
    and Mississippi Rivers meet.  The South CC Camp Road (Route 11) within the Dale
    Bumpers White River National Wildlife Refuge is a gravel road used by the public
    visiting the Refuge. During large rain events and seasonal flooding, the water
    flows over the road and it becomes inaccessible. More recent flooding seasons
    have been severe and have caused damage to the roadway and erosion of the bank.
    At the south end of the route, the road is losing ground to Big Island Chute,
    an offshoot of White River. On the north side of the roadway at this location
    there is a steep hill, which is the location of a cemetery and the start of private
    property that borders the Refuge.
