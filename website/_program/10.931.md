objective: "To establish an agricultural conservation easement program for the conservation\
  \ of eligible land and natural resources through easements or other interests in\
  \ the land. The Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) is comprised of\
  \ two components \u2013 Agricultural Land Easements (ALE) and Wetland Reserve Easements\
  \ (WRE). The ACEP-ALE component provides funding to eligible entities to purchase\
  \ conservation easements to protect the agricultural use and future viability, and\
  \ related conservation values of eligible land by limiting nonagricultural uses\
  \ of that land; and to protect grazing uses and related conservation values by restoring\
  \ or conserving eligible land. The ACEP-WRE component provides funding for the purchase\
  \ of conservation easements held by NRCS, and to restore, protect, and enhance wetlands\
  \ on eligible land."
