objective: To establish an agricultural conservation easement program for the conservation
  of eligible land and natural resources through easements or other interests in the
  land. The Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) is comprised of two
  components â€“ Agricultural Land Easements (ALE) and Wetland Reserve Easements (WRE).
  The ACEP-ALE component provides funding to eligible entities to purchase conservation
  easements to protect the agricultural use and future viability, and related conservation
  values of eligible land by limiting nonagricultural uses of that land; and to protect
  grazing uses and related conservation values by restoring or conserving eligible
  land. The ACEP-WRE component provides funding for the purchase of conservation easements
  held by NRCS, and to restore, protect, and enhance wetlands on eligible land.
