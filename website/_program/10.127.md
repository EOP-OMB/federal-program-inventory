objective: DMC offers a dairy margin protection plan which provides payments to dairy
  operations when the difference between the all-milk price and the average feed cost
  fall below a certain, producer selected, dollar amount.  Producers will be eligible
  for a basic level of margin protection for a small administrative fee and be able
  to purchase higher coverage with a premium fee.  The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary)
  will use administrative fees collected to cover administrative costs incurred to
  carry out the DMC program.
