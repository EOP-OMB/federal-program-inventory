objective: "The BioWatch program is a federally managed, locally operated early warning\
  \ system that is designed to detect the intentional release of select aerosolized\
  \ biological agents. The BioWatch program\u2019s mission is to deploy, sustain,\
  \ and maintain a national 24x7x365 operational ability to detect, and respond to\
  \ a bioterrorist event in metropolitan areas across the country. The DHS Countering\
  \ Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) administers the BioWatch program and is currently\
  \ engaged in advanced development, test, evaluation and operations to improve sampling\
  \ technologies, collection procedures, sample analysis, and develop and implement\
  \ a next generation biodetection system. The Biowatch program and PPD-8 share the\
  \ following elements. \u2022 First, in accordance with the National Preparedness\
  \ Goal, the Biowatch program provides a comprehensive strategy for countering biological\
  \ terrorism. \u2022 Next, following the National Preparedness System and the BioWatch\
  \ Program is a federally managed, locally operated early warning operational capability\
  \ designed to enhance national preparedness. The program provides an early warning\
  \ system that detects the release of a select biological agent that may pose a danger\
  \ to the public health in select jurisdictions. \u2022 Biowatch, in accordance with\
  \ the National Planning Frameworks and Federal Interagency Operational Plans, acts\
  \ as an early warning system which enhances the security of jurisdictions by providing\
  \ the needed time to execute their comprehensive concept of operations plans to\
  \ counter biological terrorism. In addition, the BioWatch program provides advice\
  \ and guidance to jurisdictions to develop biological preparedness programs that\
  \ properly address the needed mitigation plans that reduces the negative impacts\
  \ to a biological attack. The Biowatch program is a critical part of an ongoing\
  \ national effort to build and sustain preparedness which helps the United States\
  \ maintain momentum through targeted jurisdictional planning that highlights preventative\
  \ actions necessary to allow for a proper and timely response and begin the process\
  \ to recovery from a biological agent release. To provide funding and/or property\
  \ for the conduct of operations and other related activities intended to identify,\
  \ counter, or respond to biological and chemical threats."
