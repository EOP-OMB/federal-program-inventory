objective: The BioWatch program is a federally managed, locally operated early warning
  system that is designed to detect the intentional release of select aerosolized
  biological agents. The BioWatch program’s mission is to deploy, sustain, and maintain
  a 24x7x365 operational ability to detect, and respond to a bioterrorist event in
  metropolitan areas across the country. The DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction
  (CWMD) administers the BioWatch program and is currently engaged in advanced development,
  test, evaluation and operations to improve sampling technologies, collection procedures,
  sample analysis, and develop and implement a next generation biodetection system.
  The Biowatch program and PPD-8 share the following elements. • First, in accordance
  with the National Preparedness Goal, the Biowatch program provides a comprehensive
  strategy for countering biological terrorism. • Next, following the National Preparedness
  System and the BioWatch Program is a federally managed, locally operated early warning
  operational capability designed to enhance national preparedness. The program provides
  an early warning system that detects the release of a select biological agent that
  may pose a danger to the public health in select jurisdictions. • Biowatch, in accordance
  with the National Planning Frameworks and Federal Interagency Operational Plans,
  acts as an early warning system which enhances the security of jurisdictions by
  providing the needed time to execute their comprehensive concept of operations plans
  to counter biological terrorism. In addition, the BioWatch program provides advice
  and guidance to jurisdictions to develop biological preparedness programs that properly
  address the needed mitigation plans that reduces the negative impacts to a biological
  attack. The Biowatch program is a critical part of an ongoing effort to build and
  sustain preparedness which helps the United States maintain momentum through targeted
  jurisdictional planning that highlights preventative actions necessary to allow
  for a proper and timely response and begin the process to recovery from a biological
  agent release. To provide funding and/or property for the conduct of operations
  and other related activities intended to identify, counter, or respond to biological
  and chemical threats.
