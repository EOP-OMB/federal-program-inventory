objective: "Objectives\n\nThe Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program makes\
  \ federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, Federally Recognized Tribal\
  \ governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive\
  \ flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National Flood Insurance\
  \ Program (NFIP). It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated\
  \ with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities\
  \ that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding.\
  \ These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have\
  \ been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future.\
  \ From Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 to FY 2019, FMA obligated over $1.5 billion in federal\
  \ share mitigating over 8,000 properties insured by the National Flood Insurance\
  \ Program. \n\nPerformance Measures\nThe following key performance indicators provide\
  \ strategic and relevant information to decisionmakers and stakeholders about FMA’s\
  \ progress and success toward achieving goals and objectives, and are based on measurable\
  \ data that are available or could be feasibly collected:\n\n•\tTotal number of\
  \ NFIP-insured properties selected that are FMA and/or NFIP defined Severe Repetitive\
  \ Loss (SRL), Repetitive Loss (RL), and Substantially Damaged.\n•\tTotal federal\
  \ cost share funding invested in Justice40 Communities identified using version\
  \ 1.0 of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST).\n•\tTotal dollar\
  \ amount of flood losses avoided in projects or communities funded by FMA subapplications.\n\
  FEMA will further assess the recipient’s performance against the program objective\
  \ during the award closeout process as outlined in Section F.3.c of this funding\
  \ opportunity. \n\nGoals\nThe FMA program aligns with the 2020-2024 DHS Strategic\
  \ Plan through pursuing Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience. Specifically,\
  \ Objective 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness has several sub-objectives\
  \ that the FMA program supports. FMA serves primarily to bolster Sub-Objective 5.1.1:\
  \ Incentivize investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation,\
  \ including expanding the use of insurance to manage risk through funding flood\
  \ mitigation projects. The FMA program addresses Presidential Policy Directive 21,\
  \ Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. FMA also supports the National\
  \ Mitigation Investment Strategy and the FIMA FY 2021-2023 Mitigation Strategy by\
  \ advancing mitigation investment to reduce risks posed by natural hazards and increasing\
  \ the nation’s resilience to natural hazards. Awards made under this NOFO will be\
  \ funded, in whole or in part, with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment\
  \ and Jobs Act, also more commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).\
  \ The BIL is a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure, which will grow\
  \ a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy by enhancing U.S. competitiveness,\
  \ driving the creation of quality jobs, and ensuring stronger access to economic\
  \ and environmental benefits for disadvantaged communities. The BIL appropriates\
  \ billions of dollars to FEMA to promote resilient infrastructure, respond to the\
  \ impacts of climate change, and equip our nation with the resources to combat its\
  \ most pressing threats. Objectives FMA aims to implement projects that reduce flood\
  \ risks posed to repetitively flooded properties insured under the NFIP. The FMA\
  \ program also aims to promote equity in the delivery of funds in line with the\
  \ Administration’s Justice40 Initiative, established by Executive Order (EO) 14008:\
  \ Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, which has made it the goal that\
  \ 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, and other\
  \ investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened\
  \ by pollution and underinvestment. In implementing the Justice40 Initiative, the\
  \ FMA program is prioritizing assistance that benefits disadvantaged communities\
  \ as referenced in EO 14008 and subsequent guidance. FMA funds are sourced from\
  \ congressionally appropriated funding from the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF)\
  \ as well as funding made available for FY 23 Flood Mitigation Assistance via the\
  \ Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The BIL funding allows increased\
  \ federal cost share for a property: located within a census tract with a Centers\
  \ for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index score of not less\
  \ than 0.5001. (Refer to Section C.4, Cost Share or Match)."

- description: "Fiscal Year 2023: \nFY 23 FMA is prioritizing the following types\
    \ of projects: Capability and Capacity Building (C&CB), Localized Flood Risk Reduction\
    \ Projects, and Individual Flood Mitigation Projects that mitigate flood risks\
    \ to NFIP participating communities and active policyholders. FEMA will assess\
    \ input and output indicators of each federal award by measuring the total properties\
    \ mitigated that carry a Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) and Repetitive Loss (RL)\
    \ definition pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 4104c(h)(2) and (3), that are included in\
    \ a final mitigation action. FEMA will also assess each award output by measuring\
    \ project capability to positively influence the government’s goal of mitigating\
    \ SRL and RL designated properties and thereby the reduction of future losses\
    \ to the NFIP under this award. FEMA will also assess each award output by measuring\
    \ the total NFIP insured structures within sub applications within socially vulnerable\
    \ communities as defined by Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Social\
    \ Vulnerability Index (SVI ) score at the census tract not less than 0.5001. \n\
    FEMA will determine the CDC SVI score using the following three SVI themes: Socioeconomic\
    \ Status, Household Characteristics, and Housing Type and Transportation.”"
