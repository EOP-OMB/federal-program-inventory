objective: "Objectives\n\nThe Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program makes\
  \ federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, Federally Recognized Tribal\
  \ governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive\
  \ flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National Flood Insurance\
  \ Program (NFIP). It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated\
  \ with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities\
  \ that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding.\
  \ These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have\
  \ been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future.\
  \ From Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 to FY 2019, FMA obligated over $1.5 billion in federal\
  \ share mitigating over 8,000 properties insured by the National Flood Insurance\
  \ Program. \n\nPerformance Measures\nThe following key performance indicators provide\
  \ strategic and relevant information to decisionmakers and stakeholders about FMA\u2019\
  s progress and success toward achieving goals and objectives, and are based on measurable\
  \ data that are available or could be feasibly collected:\n\n\u2022\tTotal number\
  \ of NFIP-insured properties selected that are FMA and/or NFIP defined Severe Repetitive\
  \ Loss (SRL), Repetitive Loss (RL), and Substantially Damaged.\n\u2022\tTotal federal\
  \ cost share funding invested in Justice40 Communities identified using version\
  \ 1.0 of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST).\n\u2022\tTotal\
  \ dollar amount of flood losses avoided in projects or communities funded by FMA\
  \ subapplications.\nFEMA will further assess the recipient\u2019s performance against\
  \ the program objective during the award closeout process as outlined in Section\
  \ F.3.c of this funding opportunity. \n\nGoals\nThe FMA program aligns with the\
  \ 2020-2024 DHS Strategic Plan through pursuing Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness\
  \ and Resilience. Specifically, Objective 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness\
  \ has several sub-objectives that the FMA program supports. FMA serves primarily\
  \ to bolster Sub-Objective 5.1.1: Incentivize investments that reduce risk and increase\
  \ pre-disaster mitigation, including expanding the use of insurance to manage risk\
  \ through funding flood mitigation projects. The FMA program addresses Presidential\
  \ Policy Directive 21, Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. FMA also\
  \ supports the National Mitigation Investment Strategy and the FIMA FY 2021-2023\
  \ Mitigation Strategy by advancing mitigation investment to reduce risks posed by\
  \ natural hazards and increasing the nation\u2019s resilience to natural hazards.\
  \ Awards made under this NOFO will be funded, in whole or in part, with funds appropriated\
  \ by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also more commonly known as the\
  \ Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL is a once-in-a-generation investment\
  \ in infrastructure, which will grow a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable\
  \ economy by enhancing U.S. competitiveness, driving the creation of quality jobs,\
  \ and ensuring stronger access to economic and environmental benefits for disadvantaged\
  \ communities. The BIL appropriates billions of dollars to FEMA to promote resilient\
  \ infrastructure, respond to the impacts of climate change, and equip our nation\
  \ with the resources to combat its most pressing threats. Objectives FMA aims to\
  \ implement projects that reduce flood risks posed to repetitively flooded properties\
  \ insured under the NFIP. The FMA program also aims to promote equity in the delivery\
  \ of funds in line with the Administration\u2019s Justice40 Initiative, established\
  \ by Executive Order (EO) 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,\
  \ which has made it the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal\
  \ climate, clean energy, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities\
  \ that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. In implementing\
  \ the Justice40 Initiative, the FMA program is prioritizing assistance that benefits\
  \ disadvantaged communities as referenced in EO 14008 and subsequent guidance. FMA\
  \ funds are sourced from congressionally appropriated funding from the National\
  \ Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) as well as funding made available for FY 23 Flood\
  \ Mitigation Assistance via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The\
  \ BIL funding allows increased federal cost share for a property: located within\
  \ a census tract with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability\
  \ Index score of not less than 0.5001. (Refer to Section C.4, Cost Share or Match)."

- description: "Fiscal Year 2023: \nFY 23 FMA is prioritizing the following types\
    \ of projects: Capability and Capacity Building (C&CB), Localized Flood Risk Reduction\
    \ Projects, and Individual Flood Mitigation Projects that mitigate flood risks\
    \ to NFIP participating communities and active policyholders. FEMA will assess\
    \ input and output indicators of each federal award by measuring the total properties\
    \ mitigated that carry a Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) and Repetitive Loss (RL)\
    \ definition pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \xA7 4104c(h)(2) and (3), that are included\
    \ in a final mitigation action. FEMA will also assess each award output by measuring\
    \ project capability to positively influence the government\u2019s goal of mitigating\
    \ SRL and RL designated properties and thereby the reduction of future losses\
    \ to the NFIP under this award. FEMA will also assess each award output by measuring\
    \ the total NFIP insured structures within sub applications within socially vulnerable\
    \ communities as defined by Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Social\
    \ Vulnerability Index (SVI ) score at the census tract not less than 0.5001. \n\
    FEMA will determine the CDC SVI score using the following three SVI themes: Socioeconomic\
    \ Status, Household Characteristics, and Housing Type and Transportation.\u201D"
