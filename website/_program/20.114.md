objective: The objectives of the AMJP program were to help businesses that are primarily
  engaged in aircraft manufacturing activities and services, or aircraft maintenance,
  repair, and overhaul activities and services, to retain or rehire employees.  Financial
  assistance payments must be used to retain current employees or to recall employees
  who were previously laid off or furloughed.  As part of the American Rescue Plan
  Act enacted on March 11, 2021, the AMJP program provided up to $3 billion for the
  aviation manufacturing and repair industry.
