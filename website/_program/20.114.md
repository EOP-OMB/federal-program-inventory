objective: The objectives of the AMJP program were to help businesses that are primarily
  engaged in aircraft manufacturing activities and services, or aircraft maintenance,
  repair, and overhaul activities and services, to retain or rehire employees.  Financial
  assistance payments must be used to retain current employees or to recall employees
  who were previously laid off or furloughed.  As part of the American Rescue Plan
  Act enacted on March 11, 2021, the AMJP program provided up to $3 billion for the
  aviation manufacturing and repair industry.

- description: "Administered 592 AMJP awards / agreements, which included monitoring\
    \ reporting and compliance, reviewing requests for Interim and Final Payments,\
    \ and closing out agreements when all required documentation was completed.  \n\
    \nThis included deobligating funds in cases where the recipients did not incur\
    \ sufficient allowable costs during their Period of Performance.  As of July 4,\
    \ 2023, DOT had closed out 547 of the original 592 awards, and deobligated $11.8\
    \ million in unused funds on 163 of those awards (roughly a 1.2% reduction from\
    \ the initial obligated amount of $673 million).\n\nDOT's oversight also included\
    \ issuing notices regarding apparent compliance concerns, and evaluating and adjudicating\
    \ responses as appropriate.  As of July 4, 2023, DOT had issued 43 such notices,\
    \ and successfully resolved 21 cases (including compelling several AMJP recipients\
    \ to make corrective payments to more than 1,500 employees).\n\nAs of July 4,\
    \ 2023, USDOT had disbursed more than $633 million (96% of obligated funds), and\
    \ had only 32 open agreements remaining to administer.  DOT had also established\
    \ a hard set of deadlines to either close out or terminate all remaining AMJP\
    \ agreements by Sep. 30, 2023."
