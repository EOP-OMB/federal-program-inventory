objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world.  Educational and cultural engagement\
  \ is premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future\
  \ leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect\
  \ official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs inform,\
  \ engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society \u2013\
  \ including young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals\
  \ \u2013 increasing the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience\
  \ with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule\
  \ of law, economic choice, and individual dignity, while building international\
  \ knowledge and capacity among Americans.  The Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program,\
  \ a Fulbright exchange, enhances leadership among international professionals who\
  \ collaborate to address local and global challenges and foster change for the collective\
  \ good."
