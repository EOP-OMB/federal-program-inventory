objective: The Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy Program provides
  rental assistance to homeless individuals. Under the program, HUD entered into Annual
  Contributions Contracts (ACCs) with public housing agencies (PHAs) in connection
  with the moderate rehabilitation of residential properties that, when rehabilitation
  is completed, will contain multiple single room dwelling units.  Funding for new
  projects ceased after 2011.  Expiring contracts are now renewed.
