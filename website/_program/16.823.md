objective: 'The purpose of this project is to provide funding to States to develop
  comprehensive plans that address the specific needs of children, youth, and families
  involved in the justice system during an emergency. Specifically, the initiative
  supports implementation of the principles outlined in the OJJDP report, Emergency
  Planning for Juvenile Justice Residential Facilities (www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/234936.pdf).
  This report is targeted to state, county,  and local juvenile justice authorities
  charged with the custodial care and supervision of youth in the juvenile justice
  system, with particular focus on those authorities who oversee residential treatment
  and correctional and detention facilities that house juveniles via court-ordered
  placements. The principles outlined in this document may also apply to emergency
  planning for youth in out-of-home placement.


  The performance measures associated with this objective are:


  PM 1: Number of new policies employed to address emergency preparedness gaps

  PM 2: Percentage of individuals with increased knowledge of facility emergency preparedness
