objective: "DHS S&T utilizes grants and cooperative agreements to conduct research,\
  \ development, testing, evaluation, and demonstration of national preparedness and\
  \ homeland security technologies and knowledge products intended to identify, counter,\
  \ or respond to terrorist threats through enhanced public safety, security, prevention,\
  \ mitigation, and response.  The purpose of these grants and cooperative agreements\
  \ is to garner high quality, advanced concepts research and development efforts\
  \ related to important scientific problems and capability gaps identified by the\
  \ first responder community through the First Responders Resource Group (FRRG) and/or\
  \ DHS components that require the evidence needed to inform policy and operational\
  \ objectives, that could lead to significant public benefits that span multiple\
  \ domains including first responders, personal protective equipment, terrorism and\
  \ targeted violence, soft target security, and human trafficking. \n\nDHS S&T utilizes\
  \ 97.108 to issue grants and cooperative agreements for a diverse set of requirements\
  \ from developing tools and capabilities for the first responder community to defend\
  \ and mitigate the health risk associated with their exposure to chemical, biological,\
  \ physical, or radiological elements, better understand the nature of terrorism,\
  \ targeted violence, insider threats and human trafficking. DHS S&T aims to conduct\
  \ basic and applied research to better understand an evolving threat landscape and\
  \ to provide these resources to S/L/T/T and the general public with the goal of\
  \ delivering personal protective equipment to the first responder and enhancing\
  \ public safety while preventing acts of violence from impacting our communities.\
  \ S&T research will enable policy makers and operational end-users to make informed\
  \ decisions to divert vulnerable individuals, prevent potential offenders, mitigate\
  \ vulnerabilities, and enhance community resilience in the face of various threats."
