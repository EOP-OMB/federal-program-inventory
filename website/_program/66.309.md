objective: 'The program''s objective is to provide funding in support of surveys,
  studies and investigations, training (including technical assistance) and special
  purpose assistance programs as they relate to environmental and/or public health
  issues, with a particular emphasis on environmental justice. The FY 2022 Appropriations
  Act authorized the use of Environmental Program & Management (EPM) funds for implementation
  and training (including technical assistance) grants for the first time, as well
  as authorization to continue the Environmental Justice (EJ) grants programs. Funding
  Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  EPA will prioritize grants for technical assistance,
  training, and resources/support to community and non-profit organizations, educational
  institutions including Minority Serving Institutions, governmental entities, and
  other stakeholders. Assistance awards made under this listing are part of a multifaceted
  approach to benefit underserved communities facing environmental justice challenges.  Awards
  under this listing will be for the establishment and maintenance of Environmental
  Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers (EJ-TCTAC) with a physical
  location(s) or a virtual/technological presence providing technical assistance,
  training, and support/resources to underserved communities interested in EPA grant
  programs, community stakeholders, nonprofits, grassroots organizations, local government
  entities, and state governmental entities.'

- description: 'The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is announcing the selection
    of 16 selectees for the Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance
    Centers Program (EJ TCTACs or Program.) Seventeen organizations and their partners
    have been selected to receive a total of approximately $177 million to establish
    a network of technical assistance centers (Centers) across the nation providing
    direct technical assistance, training, and capacity-building support to communities
    and organizations to advance environmental and energy justice priorities. With
    this critical investment, the Centers will provide training and other assistance
    to build capacity of local grassroots nonprofit organizations, tribal governments,
    and other similar community stakeholders in navigating federal, state, and private
    grant application systems such as Grants.gov and SAM.gov, writing stronger grant
    proposals, and effectively managing grant funding. In addition, these Centers
    will provide guidance on community engagement, meeting facilitation, and translation
    and interpretation services for limited English-speaking participants, thus removing
    barriers and improving accessibility to resources for communities with environmental
    justice concerns. Each of the Centers will also create and manage communication
    channels to ensure all communities have direct access to resources and information.
    Final awards are subject to administrative and legal reviews to verify compliance
    with applicable requirements. EPA and the US Department of Energy (DOE) will cooperatively
    fund these 16 awards, which will feature 13 Regional Centers and 3 National Centers
    working collaboratively across the United States supporting communities. These
    16 awards will be in the form of incrementally funded cooperative agreements where
    EPA and DOE staff will have substantial involvement in the oversight and implementation
    of the Program. The establishment of this Program and Centers is in direct response
    to feedback from communities and environmental justice leaders who have long called
    for technical assistance and capacity building support for communities and their
    partners as they work to access critical federal, state, and private resources
    and engage in decision-making that impacts them. The 16 Centers will provide comprehensive
    coverage for the entire United States through a network of over 160 partners including
    community-based organizations, additional academic institutions, and other stakeholders
    so more communities can access federal funding opportunities like those made available
    through President Bidenâ€™s Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law as well as funding from states and private foundations.  All centers are currently
    scheduled to operate from June 2023 to June 2028. For more information, visit:
