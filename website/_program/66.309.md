- description: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in partnership with the US
    Department of Energy (DOE) awarded 16 Environmental Justice Thriving Communities
    Technical Assistance Centers Program (EJ TCTACs or Program).  The 16 organizations
    and their partners have been selected to receive a total of approximately $177
    million over the full life of their projects and will establish a network of technical
    assistance centers (Centers) across the nation providing direct technical assistance,
    training, and capacity-building support to communities and organizations to advance
    environmental and energy justice priorities. With this critical investment, the
    Centers will provide training and other assistance to build capacity of local
    grassroots nonprofit organizations, tribal governments, and other similar community
    stakeholders in navigating federal, state, and private grant application systems
    such as Grants.gov and SAM.gov, writing stronger grant proposals, and effectively
    managing grant funding. In addition, these Centers will provide guidance on community
    engagement, meeting facilitation, and translation and interpretation services
    for limited English-speaking participants, thus removing barriers and improving
    accessibility to resources for communities with environmental justice concerns.
    Each of the Centers will also create and manage communication channels to ensure
    all communities have direct access to resources and information. EPA and DOE will
    cooperatively funded these 16 awards, which will feature 13 Regional Centers and
    3 National Centers working collaboratively across the United States supporting
    communities. These 16 awards will be in the form of incrementally funded cooperative
    agreements where EPA and DOE staff will have substantial involvement in the oversight
    and implementation of the Program. The establishment of this Program and Centers
    is in direct response to feedback from communities and environmental justice leaders
    who have long called for technical assistance and capacity building support for
    communities and their partners as they work to access critical federal, state,
    and private resources and engage in decision-making that impacts them. The 16
    Centers will provide comprehensive coverage for the entire United States through
    a network of over 160 partners including community-based organizations, additional
    academic institutions, and other stakeholders so more communities can access federal
    funding opportunities, as well as funding from states and private foundations.
