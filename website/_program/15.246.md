objective: "The T&E Species Program has an important role in furthering the Administration’s\
  \ priorities including restoring landscape connectivity and function, conserving\
  \ and restoring lands to combat climate change, restoring legacy disturbances, supporting\
  \ the Civilian Climate Corps, conserving biodiversity, reducing species’ extinctions,\
  \ increasing recovery success, and using the best science and data available to\
  \ make decisions, provide decision support, and adaptively manage.  \nThe BLM, as\
  \ a federal agency, is required under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to carry\
  \ out programs to protect and recover threatened and endangered (T&E) species and\
  \ the ecosystems upon which they depend and implements tasks identified in T&E recovery\
  \ plans developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine\
  \ Fisheries Service. The BLM also implements conservation actions for sensitive\
  \ and candidate species to preclude the need for federal listing. The Threatened\
  \ and Endangered Species Program works to conserve and recover federally-listed\
  \ animal and plant species and their habitat on public lands and shares cooperative\
  \ responsibility with other BLM programs and partners for conservation of candidate\
  \ and sensitive species. The scope of the T&E Species Program spans all taxa that\
  \ merit designation under the Endangered Species Act or are identified as BLM sensitive\
  \ species, providing a cross section of the most imperiled species of mammals, reptiles,\
  \ birds, amphibians, invertebrates, fish, and plants. As of 2023, there are over\
  \ 330 federally threatened and endangered species and 2400 federal sensitive species\
  \ occur within BLM managed lands. Public lands often provide the key habitat for\
  \ species recovery and conservation. Managing more land than any other federal agency,\
  \ the BLM plays a pivotal and substantive role in species recovery. Due to the commingling\
  \ of federal and nonfederal lands, the BLM’s proactive commitment to conserve threatened\
  \ and endangered species is essential to federal, state, and non-governmental organizations\
  \ in meeting our mutual interest of species recovery. Collaboration on conservation\
  \ endeavors with the ultimate goal to increase threatened and endangered species\
  \ or BLM sensitive species populations and manage and restore habitat of these federal\
  \ trust wildlife, fish and plants within the public domain, serves a public purpose\
  \ as required in cooperative agreements.  This program supports project funded through\
  \ the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Section 40804 (b) Ecosystem Restoration."

- description: Made over 95 awards - The highest priority areas of focus for the Threatened
    and Endangered Species program are to implement recovery tasks for those species
    that have the highest potential to be recovered; address the needs of those species
    with the highest risk of extinction; and conserve those species experiencing the
    greatest conflict in BLM multiple use operations. There are times when, instead
    of approaching recovery of a specific focal species, conservation actions must
    be on the broader ecosystem itself, with restoration centered on its primary function
    or driver. Such is the case of the coastal dunes in northern California, home
    to seven listed plants and the western snowy plover.

- description: Removal of invasive plant species and restoration with native species
    along riverways of the Pecos watershed (enhance habitat for T&E species), conduct
    genetic studies, surveys and modeling of listed plant and bird species; monitor
    desert tortoises and raven predation.
  year: '2020'
- description: BLM funded 97 projects at the national, state and field levels across
    13 western states.  Projects included removal of invasive plant species and restoration
    with native species along riverways of the Pecos watershed (enhance habitat for
    T&E species); conduct genetic studies of listed plant and bird species; monitor
    desert tortoises and raven predation. Project to improve the consistency and efficiency
    of how Element Occurrence (EO) data (special status species observation records)
    are collected, and managed to improve the information BLM uses to make decisions
    for NEPA compliance, conservation, and recovery. Identifying communal data workflows
    that improve the quality and timeliness of the data BLM needs to conserve and
    manage species.

- description: "In FY23, BLM funded NatureServe for the following efforts: 1) Maintain\
    \ up to date species taxonomy, distribution, and status.\n2) Identify and fill\
    \ gaps in distribution data for SSS using species habitat models and other data.\n\
    3) Develop prioritization tool for BLM SSS.  \n4) Improve data exchange between\
    \ BLM, network programs, and NatureServe.\n5) Coordinate the management and use\
    \ of mobile apps and survey forms for collection of SSS data. \n6) Provide access\
    \ through Explorer Pro for BLM staff to visualize, query, and download subsets\
    \ and associated attributes of precise location spatial data.\n\nBLM also funded\
    \ Conservation Science Partners facilitation and development of a BLM rangewide\
    \ Mojave desert tortoise strategic plan."

rules_regulations: BLM's wildlife botany program is generally guided by provisions
  in 43 CFR Part 6000. A variety of public interest publications on these programs
  are available free of charge by contacting the appropriate State Office. Manuals
  providing basic program operational guidance for recreation (BLM Manual 6500) and
  may be obtained by contacting the Washington Office. In addition, 43 CFR 24 guides
  the BLM to collaboratively conserve resident wildlife with the state agencies.  Migratory
  birds, a federal responsibility, as described in 43 CFR 24, are also collaboratively
  managed with state and other federal agencies.
