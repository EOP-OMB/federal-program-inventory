objective: "The T&E Species Program has an important role in furthering the Administration\u2019\
  s priorities including restoring landscape connectivity and function, conserving\
  \ and restoring lands to combat climate change, restoring legacy disturbances, supporting\
  \ the Civilian Climate Corps, conserving biodiversity, reducing species\u2019 extinctions,\
  \ increasing recovery success, and using the best science and data available to\
  \ make decisions, provide decision support, and adaptively manage.  \nThe BLM, as\
  \ a federal agency, is required under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to carry\
  \ out programs to protect and recover threatened and endangered (T&E) species and\
  \ the ecosystems upon which they depend and implements tasks identified in T&E recovery\
  \ plans developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine\
  \ Fisheries Service. The BLM also implements conservation actions for sensitive\
  \ and candidate species to preclude the need for federal listing. The Threatened\
  \ and Endangered Species Program works to conserve and recover federally-listed\
  \ animal and plant species and their habitat on public lands and shares cooperative\
  \ responsibility with other BLM programs and partners for conservation of candidate\
  \ and sensitive species. The scope of the T&E Species Program spans all taxa that\
  \ merit designation under the Endangered Species Act, providing a cross section\
  \ of the most imperiled species of mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, invertebrates,\
  \ fish, and plants. As of 2023, there are over 330 federally threatened and endangered\
  \ species and 2400 federal sensitive species occur within BLM managed lands. Public\
  \ lands often provide the key habitat for species recovery and conservation. Managing\
  \ more land than any other federal agency, the BLM plays a pivotal and substantive\
  \ role in species recovery. Due to the commingling of federal and nonfederal lands,\
  \ the BLM\u2019s proactive commitment to conserve threatened and endangered species\
  \ is essential to federal, state, and non-governmental organizations in meeting\
  \ our mutual interest of species recovery. Collaboration on conservation endeavors\
  \ with the ultimate goal to increase threatened and endangered species populations\
  \ and manage and restore habitat of these federal trust wildlife, fish and plants\
  \ within the public domain, serves a public purpose as required in cooperative agreements.\
  \  This program supports project funded through the Infrastructure Investment and\
  \ Jobs Act, Section 40804 (b) Ecosystem Restoration."
