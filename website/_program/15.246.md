objective: "The T&E Species Program has an important role in furthering the Administration\u2019\
  s priorities including restoring landscape connectivity and function, conserving\
  \ and restoring lands to combat climate change, restoring legacy disturbances, supporting\
  \ the Civilian Climate Corps, conserving biodiversity, reducing species\u2019 extinctions,\
  \ increasing recovery success, and using the best science and data available to\
  \ make decisions, provide decision support, and adaptively manage.  \nThe BLM, as\
  \ a federal agency, is required under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to carry\
  \ out programs to protect and recover threatened and endangered (T&E) species and\
  \ the ecosystems upon which they depend and implements tasks identified in T&E recovery\
  \ plans developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine\
  \ Fisheries Service. The BLM also implements conservation actions for sensitive\
  \ and candidate species to preclude the need for federal listing. The Threatened\
  \ and Endangered Species Program works to conserve and recover federally-listed\
  \ animal and plant species and their habitat on public lands and shares cooperative\
  \ responsibility with other BLM programs and partners for conservation of candidate\
  \ and sensitive species. The scope of the T&E Species Program spans all taxa that\
  \ merit designation under the Endangered Species Act, providing a cross section\
  \ of the most imperiled species of mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, invertebrates,\
  \ fish, and plants. As of 2023, there are over 330 federally threatened and endangered\
  \ species and 2400 federal sensitive species occur within BLM managed lands. Public\
  \ lands often provide the key habitat for species recovery and conservation. Managing\
  \ more land than any other federal agency, the BLM plays a pivotal and substantive\
  \ role in species recovery. Due to the commingling of federal and nonfederal lands,\
  \ the BLM\u2019s proactive commitment to conserve threatened and endangered species\
  \ is essential to federal, state, and non-governmental organizations in meeting\
  \ our mutual interest of species recovery. Collaboration on conservation endeavors\
  \ with the ultimate goal to increase threatened and endangered species populations\
  \ and manage and restore habitat of these federal trust wildlife, fish and plants\
  \ within the public domain, serves a public purpose as required in cooperative agreements.\
  \  This program supports project funded through the Infrastructure Investment and\
  \ Jobs Act, Section 40804 (b) Ecosystem Restoration."

    office levels across 13 western states. Projects included species translocations,
    invasive species removal projects, the construction of an invasive fish barrier
    and fish passage projects, wildlife and plant surveys, and recovery actions for
    desert tortoise. In partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation,
    projects that benefit, riparian species and watershed restoration project along
    the Colorado, Gila, and Pecos rivers. In partnership with NatureServe special
    status species conservation assessments and habitat modeling and in partnership
