objective: It is the policy of the United States to promote the general welfare of
  the Nation by employing funds and credit of the Nation, as established in section
  2 of the 1937 Act, of assisting States and their political subdivisions {e.g., Public
  Housing Authorities (PHA)s} to remedy the unsafe housing conditions and the acute
  shortage of decent and safe dwellings for low-income families as well as address
  the shortage of housing affordable to low-income families.  The PBCA program furthers
  these policies by effectuating authority explicitly under section 8(b)(1) of the
  1937 Act for HUD to enter into Annual Contributions Contracts (ACCs) with PHAs for
  the administration of Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contracts. For
  the purpose of aiding lower-income families in obtaining a decent place to live
  and of promoting economically mixed housing, assistance payments may be made with
  respect to existing housing in accordance with the provisions of this section.  For
  the project-based subprograms authorized under Section 8, the 1937 Act authorizes
  HUD to enter into an ACC with a PHA, as defined in section 3(b)(6)(A) of the 1937
  Act. The ACC is the contractual mechanism to support the PHAâ€™s public purpose in
  making the assistance payments to Section 8 project owners. This program provides
  assistance to PHAs for the administration of Project-Based Section 8 program within
  a State.
