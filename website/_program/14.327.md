objective: "It is the policy of the United States to promote the general welfare of\
  \ the Nation by employing funds and credit of the Nation, as established in section\
  \ 2 of the 1937 Act, of assisting States and their political subdivisions {e.g.,\
  \ Public Housing Authorities (PHA)s} to remedy the unsafe housing conditions and\
  \ the acute shortage of decent and safe dwellings for low-income families as well\
  \ as address the shortage of housing affordable to low-income families.  The PBCA\
  \ program furthers these policies by effectuating authority explicitly under section\
  \ 8(b)(1) of the 1937 Act for HUD to enter into Annual Contributions Contracts (ACCs)\
  \ with PHAs for the administration of Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP)\
  \ contracts. For the purpose of aiding lower-income families in obtaining a decent\
  \ place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing, assistance payments\
  \ may be made with respect to existing housing in accordance with the provisions\
  \ of this section.  For the project-based subprograms authorized under Section 8,\
  \ the 1937 Act authorizes HUD to enter into an ACC with a PHA, as defined in section\
  \ 3(b)(6)(A) of the 1937 Act. The ACC is the contractual mechanism to support the\
  \ PHA\u2019s public purpose in making the assistance payments to Section 8 project\
  \ owners. This program provides assistance to PHAs for the administration of Project-Based\
  \ Section 8 program within a State."
