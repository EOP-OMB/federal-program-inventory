- description: "Dr. Boyraz and his team are designing and prototyping a steerable/pointable,\
    \ space-based laser altimeter that can be rapidly re-aimed and repeatedly illuminated.\
    \ The laser measures the distance from the spacecraft to the sea or river surface,\
    \ and can make maps of the coastal tides, or to gauge the discharge of a river,\
    \ by measuring the hydraulic head, the difference in height between two sections\
    \ of river.  Dr. Boyraz\u2019 team has shown the viability of the concept and\
    \ built laboratory examples to demonstrate it, as well as evaluating the suitability\
    \ of the lasing hardware for space applications (pointing accuracy, size, weight,\
    \ energy and heat budgets).  If the design phase is completed satisfactorily,\
    \ the intent would be to build it as a hostable payload for a technology demonstration\
    \ in space."
