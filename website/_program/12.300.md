- description: The mission of the programs funded against CFDA 12.300 is to discover,
    innovate, and transition science and technology to ensure dominant strategic sea
    power, now and into the future. To execute this mission, the Navy leverages the
    substantial intellectual resource represented by the global academic scientific
    research community. Formation of a collaborative and transparent relationship
    with this community, with industry, and with small business for the enhanced discovery
    and innovation, and effective execution of basic and applied research programs
    in a variety of technical focus areas of high Navy interest.

- description: 'During the height of the COVID pandemic, the grantee deployed 100
    drifting

    wave buoys in the Southern Ocean.  Storms in the Southern Ocean generate

    energetic waves that radiate across the Pacific, Atlantic , and Indian

    ocean. The propagation of of these traveling swell waves was first

    investigated by Dr. Walter Munk in the 1960''s with funding from the Office

    of Naval Research (ONR). Progress in ocean Internet of Things (IoT)

    technology enables the grantee to collect unprecedented data densities, which

    directly improves ocean and wave theories, validate and constrain ocean and

    atmospheric models, and provide a ground truth for satellite remote sensing

    data. The technology deployed by the grantee was developed with ONR sponsorship.

    It represents a shift in global ocean sensing toward a distributed paradigm

    with massive arrays of low-cost internet-connected nodes.'

- description: Dr. Boyraz and his team are designing and prototyping a steerable/pointable,
    space-based laser altimeter that can be rapidly re-aimed and repeatedly illuminated.
    The laser measures the distance from the spacecraft to the sea or river surface,
    and can make maps of the coastal tides, or to gauge the discharge of a river,
    by measuring the hydraulic head, the difference in height between two sections
    of river.  Dr. Boyraz’ team has shown the viability of the concept and built laboratory
    examples to demonstrate it, as well as evaluating the suitability of the lasing
    hardware for space applications (pointing accuracy, size, weight, energy and heat
    budgets).  If the design phase is completed satisfactorily, the intent would be
    to build it as a hostable payload for a technology demonstration in space.
