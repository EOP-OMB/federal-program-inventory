objective: 'The projects address specific issues related to agricultural trade and
  market access, climate-smart agriculture, animal and plant health, biotechnology,
  food safety and security, and sustainable natural resource management. Topics are
  broadly consistent with the Global Food Security Act of 2016, i.e.:

  1. Accelerate inclusive, agricultural-led economic growth that reduces global poverty,
  hunger, and malnutrition, particularly among women and children.

  2. Increase the productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of small-scale producers,
  especially women, by working across agricultural value chains, enhancing local capacity
  to manage agricultural resources effectively, and expanding producer access to local
  and international markets.

  3. Build resilience to food shocks among vulnerable populations and households while
  reducing reliance upon emergency food assistance.

  4. Create an enabling environment for agricultural growth and investment, including
  through the promotion of secure and transparent property rights.

  5. Improve the nutritional status of women and children, with a focus on reducing
  child stunting, including through the promotion of highly nutritious foods, diet
  diversification, and nutritional behaviors that improve maternal and child health.

  6. Align with and leverage broader United States strategies and investments in trade,
  economic growth, science and technology, agricultural research and extension, maternal
  and child health, nutrition, and water, sanitation, and hygiene.'
