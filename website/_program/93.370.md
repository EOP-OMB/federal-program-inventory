objective: "To provide support for initiatives funded under the 21st Century Cures\
  \ Act to support the BRAIN Initiative\u2019s aim of revolutionizing our understanding\
  \ of the human brain. By accelerating the development and application of innovative\
  \ technologies, researchers will be able to produce a revolutionary new dynamic\
  \ picture of the brain that, for the first time, shows how individual cells and\
  \ complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. Long desired by researchers\
  \ seeking new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, this picture\
  \ will fill major gaps in our current knowledge and provide unprecedented opportunities\
  \ for exploring exactly how the brain enables the human body to record, process,\
  \ utilize, "
