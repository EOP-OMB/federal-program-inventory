objective: 'To provide support for initiatives funded under the 21st Century Cures
  Act to support the BRAIN Initiativeâ€™s aim of revolutionizing our understanding of
  the human brain. By accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies,
  researchers will be able to produce a revolutionary new dynamic picture of the brain
  that, for the first time, shows how individual cells and complex neural circuits
  interact in both time and space. Long desired by researchers seeking new ways to
  treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, this picture will fill major gaps
  in our current knowledge and provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring exactly
  how the brain enables the human body to record, process, utilize, '
