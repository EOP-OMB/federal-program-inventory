objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, interest earned on State
  and local bonds issued to finance student loans is tax-exempt under current law.
  The volume of all such private activity bonds that each State may issue annually
  is limited.
