    \ for Coastal Management, Pacific Islands, located in Honolulu, provided competitive\
    \ grants through the Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) Hawaii program\
    \ to foster the development of innovative science programs, partnerships and products\
    \ throughout the State of Hawaii, as well as support environmental education efforts\
    \ that align with national and state education standards. B-WET Hawaii projects\
    \ focused on providing meaningful outdoor experiences for students and professional\
    \ development opportunities for teachers that target understanding earth system\
    \ sciences, hazards, community resilience, and climate change. \r\n\r\nThe Bay\
    \ Watershed and Education Program, sponsored a 2015 grant with the University\
    \ of Hawaii to support student investigations in marine science. The He'eia Ahupua'a\
    \ project provided a framework for both developing Science, Technology, Engineering\
    \ and Math, (STEM) education programs in a new way, and a model for cross-disciplinary\
    \ work within the university culture. It also catalyzed partnerships between the\
    \ university, local schools and communities, and provided valuable K-12 teaching\
    \ experiences for young emerging scientists, fostered future interdisciplinary\
    \ interests and improved abilities in communicating science to diverse audiences.\r\
    \n\r\nThe Bay Watershed, Education, and Training program sponsored a 205 project\
    \ with the University of Hawaii titled “The Kaneohe Ahupuaa Ridge-to-Reef Project\
    \ (KARRP): An Environmental Science Education, Stewardship and Research Program\
    \ for High School Juniors and Seniors in Hawaii.” The project offered college-level\
    \ summer experience in environmental science education and research for high school\
    \ juniors and seniors during the summer of 2015. Through an intensive six-week\
    \ summer program, the investigators broadened students understanding of the Kaneohe\
    \ Bay watershed and coral reef ecosystem, introduced them to new scientific research\
    \ areas, added to their knowledge of current scientific methodology, research\
    \ techniques, and scientific tools, and encouraged environmental stewardship.\
    \ \r\n\r\nThe Office for Coastal Management – Pacific Islands, is continuing to\
    \ manage the competitive Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) Hawaii program\
    \ to foster the development of innovative science programs, partnerships and products\
    \ throughout the State of Hawaii, as well as support environmental education efforts\
    \ that align with national and state education standards (subject to the availability\
    \ of funding).\r\n"

- description: 'The NOAA Office for Coastal Management funded $10,000,000 in NOAA
    Coastal Resilience Grants in FY 2016 and 2017 to ramp up the nation’s ability
    to address existing and emerging coastal challenges. Recipients include state
    and local government agencies and nonprofits. They will use these funds to improve
    their respective region’s ability to prepare for and recover from a variety of
    coastal threats, including hurricanes, tsunamis, and sea level rise. Project focus
    areas include flood protection, infrastructure improvement, restoration of coastal
    habitat, and proactive community planning initiatives. The emphasis is on protecting
    life and property, safeguarding people and infrastructure, strengthening the economy,
    and conserving and restoring coastal and marine resources. The awards cover 17
    states and Puerto Rico. Over 350 coastal communities will be impacted, and 1,100
    acres of habitat will be restored and used to enhance flood protection. '
