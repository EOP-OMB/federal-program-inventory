objective: "Goals: The goal is to assist agencies in reducing violent crime and support\
  \ law enforcement through officer safety, enhance the ability to identify, target,\
  \ and remove criminal conspiracies and activities spanning multi-jurisdictional,\
  \ multi-state, and sometime international boundaries. While the RISS Centers operate\
  \ independently and are tailored to support the unique needs of the region served,\
  \ they also operate as a collective body to address national criminal justice issues.\
  \ RISS is governed by a National Policy Group comprised of the six RISS Directors\
  \ and the Chair of each regional center’s board of directors. The Bureau of Justice\
  \ Assistance (BJA), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), administers the RISS Program.\n\
  \nObjectives: The primary objective for RISS is to promote and strengthen relationships\
  \ and strategies for the administration of justice with law enforcement agencies,\
  \ organizations, prosecutors, and defenders through innovative leadership and programs.\
  \  This objective also includes providing training, technical assistance, and resources\
  \ in support of the program’s goals.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Percentage of conflicts\
  \ identified from RISSafe; \n\nPerformance Measure  2: Number of inquiries to the\
  \ RISS hosted databases;\n\nPerformance Measure  3: Number of participants who\n\
  successfully completed the training; and, \n\nPerformance Measure 4: Number of publications\
  \ developed and disseminated."
