objective: "Goals: The goal is to assist agencies in reducing violent crime and support\
  \ law enforcement through officer safety, enhance the ability to identify, target,\
  \ and remove criminal conspiracies and activities spanning multi-jurisdictional,\
  \ multi-state, and sometime international boundaries. \n\nObjectives: While the\
  \ RISS Centers operate independently and are tailored to support the unique needs\
  \ of the region served, they also operate as a collective body to address national\
  \ criminal justice issues. RISS is governed by a National Policy Group comprised\
  \ of the six RISS Directors and the Chair of each regional center’s board of directors.\
  \ The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), administers\
  \ the RISS Program.  The primary objective for RISS is to promote and strengthen\
  \ relationships and strategies for the administration of justice with law enforcement\
  \ agencies, organizations, prosecutors, and defenders through innovative leadership\
  \ and programs.  This objective also includes providing training, technical assistance,\
  \ and resources in support of the program’s goals.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Percentage\
  \ of conflicts identified from RISSafe; \n\nPerformance Measure  2: Number of inquiries\
  \ to the RISS hosted databases;\n\nPerformance Measure  3: Number of participants\
  \ who\nsuccessfully completed the training; and, \n\nPerformance Measure 4: Number\
  \ of publications developed and disseminated."
