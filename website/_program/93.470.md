objective: The purpose of the Alzheimer’s Disease Program Initiative (ADPI) is to
  work at state and community levels to develop and expand the availability of dementia-capable
  supports and services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
  (ADRD), their families, and their caregivers.  Funded programs will bring dementia
  capability to the communities they serve through expansion of existing home and
  community based service systems.  ADPI programs include dementia-capable direct
  services and supports, translation and implementation of evidence based interventions
  designed to improve the lives of persons with dementia and their caregivers, as
  well as dementia specific training for formal and informal caregivers.  All funded
  initiatives will include robust, outcome-based evaluations designed to demonstrate
  program impact and support future translation successful program components.
