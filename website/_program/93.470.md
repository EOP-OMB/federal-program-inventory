objective: "The purpose of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Program Initiative (ADPI)\
  \ is to work at state and community levels to develop and expand the availability\
  \ of dementia-capable supports and services for persons with Alzheimer's disease\
  \ and related dementias (ADRD), their families, and their caregivers.  Funded programs\
  \ will bring dementia capability to the communities they serve through expansion\
  \ of existing home and community based service systems.  ADPI programs include dementia-capable\
  \ direct services and supports, translation and implementation of evidence based\
  \ interventions designed to improve the lives of persons with dementia and their\
  \ caregivers, as well as dementia specific training for formal and informal caregivers.\
  \  All funded initiatives will include robust, outcome-based evaluations designed\
  \ to demonstrate program impact and support future translation successful program\
  \ components."
