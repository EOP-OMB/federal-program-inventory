objective: "Direct Implementation Tribal Cooperative Agreements (DITCAs) enable EPA\
  \ to award cooperative agreements to federally recognized Indian tribes and eligible\
  \ intertribal consortia to help carry out the Agency's function to directly implement\
  \ Federal environmental programs required or authorized by law in the absence of\
  \ an authorized or delegated tribal program, notwithstanding the Federal Grant and\
  \ Cooperative Agreement Act. DITCAs are an increasingly important avenue for EPA\
  \ and the tribes to realize meaningful environmental protection in Indian Country.\
  \ DITCAs enable EPA to partner with tribes to help fulfill EPA's direct implementation\
  \ authorities, yield environmental results, and assist the Agency in meeting its\
  \ Strategic Plan goals and targets. DITCAs also provide tribes with flexibility\
  \ and opportunity by allowing tribes, through a workplan with EPA and under federal\
  \ authority, to choose aspects of a program that address their tribal environmental\
  \ needs and priorities, to determine the scope and pace of tribal involvement, and\
  \ to build tribal capacity to implement environmental programs.\n\nEPA is committed\
  \ to work on a government-to-government basis to build tribal capacity to implement\
  \ federal programs through delegations, authorizations, and primacy designations\
  \ to enable tribes to meaningfully participate in the Agency\u2019s policy making,\
  \ standard setting, and direct implementation activities under federal environmental\
  \ statutes. EPA will work with individual tribes to develop and implement an EPA-Tribal\
  \ Environmental Plan (ETEP), a joint planning document for achieving stronger environmental\
  \ and human health protection in Indian country. ETEPs identify tribal, EPA, and\
  \ shared priorities, and the roles and responsibilities for addressing those priorities.\
  \ EPA will focus its direct implementation efforts on areas of high need for human\
  \ health or environmental protection, including programs identified in the ETEP\
  \ for which tribes are not eligible, as well as those for which tribes do not currently\
  \ anticipate seeking delegation, authorization, or primacy. In carrying out its\
  \ direct implementation activities, EPA will work closely with tribes to develop\
  \ tribal capacity to meaningfully participate in programs for which they do not\
  \ anticipate seeking delegation, authorization, or primacy. EPA will also encourage\
  \ tribes to participate in policy making and to assume appropriate partial roles\
  \ in the implementation of programs, including through the use of DITCAs or other\
  \ agreements, as available. DITCAs provide an avenue for tribes and EPA to partner\
  \ in implementing meaningful environmental protection programs in Indian country.\
  \ Because DITCAs can address a wide range of activities, and the need for implementation\
  \ of these activities in Indian country is great, the funding priority is for any\
  \ eligible activity that addresses a tribal environmental need or priority, and\
  \ yields meaningful environmental and/or public health results for the tribe and\
  \ the Agency."
