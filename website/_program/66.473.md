objective: 'Direct Implementation Tribal Cooperative Agreements (DITCAs) enable EPA
  to award cooperative agreements to federally recognized Indian tribes and eligible
  intertribal consortia to help carry out the Agency''s function to directly implement
  Federal environmental programs required or authorized by law in the absence of an
  authorized or delegated tribal program, notwithstanding the Federal Grant and Cooperative
  Agreement Act. DITCAs are an increasingly important avenue for EPA and the tribes
  to realize meaningful environmental protection in Indian Country. DITCAs enable
  EPA to partner with tribes to help fulfill EPA''s direct implementation authorities,
  yield environmental results, and assist the Agency in meeting its Strategic Plan
  goals and targets. DITCAs also provide tribes with flexibility and opportunity by
  allowing tribes, through a workplan with EPA and under federal authority, to choose
  aspects of a program that address their tribal environmental needs and priorities,
  to determine the scope and pace of tribal involvement, and to build tribal capacity
  to implement environmental programs.


  EPA is committed to work on a government-to-government basis to build tribal capacity
  to implement federal programs through delegations, authorizations, and primacy designations
  to enable tribes to meaningfully participate in the Agency’s policy making, standard
  setting, and direct implementation activities under federal environmental statutes.
  EPA will work with individual tribes to develop and implement an EPA-Tribal Environmental
  Plan (ETEP), a joint planning document for achieving stronger environmental and
  human health protection in Indian country. ETEPs identify tribal, EPA, and shared
  priorities, and the roles and responsibilities for addressing those priorities.
  EPA will focus its direct implementation efforts on areas of high need for human
  health or environmental protection, including programs identified in the ETEP for
  which tribes are not eligible, as well as those for which tribes do not currently
  anticipate seeking delegation, authorization, or primacy. In carrying out its direct
  implementation activities, EPA will work closely with tribes to develop tribal capacity
  to meaningfully participate in programs for which they do not anticipate seeking
  delegation, authorization, or primacy. EPA will also encourage tribes to participate
  in policy making and to assume appropriate partial roles in the implementation of
  programs, including through the use of DITCAs or other agreements, as available.
  DITCAs provide an avenue for tribes and EPA to partner in implementing meaningful
  environmental protection programs in Indian country. Because DITCAs can address
  a wide range of activities, and the need for implementation of these activities
  in Indian country is great, the funding priority is for any eligible activity that
  addresses a tribal environmental need or priority and yields meaningful environmental
  and/or public health results for the tribe and the Agency.'
