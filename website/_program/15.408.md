objective: The Renewable Energy Program oversees the leasing of areas on the outer
  continental shelf for development of renewable energy facilities.  The program not
  only supports decisions made within the Department of the Interior, but also provides
  coastal states and local governments with the information necessary to ensure that
  all stages of offshore renewable energy projects are conducted in a manner to protect
  both the human and natural environments.  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
  (OCSLA) Section 1345 authorizes the use of cooperative agreements with affected
  states to meet the requirements of OCSLA, including sharing information, joint utilization
  of available expertise, formation of joint monitoring arrangements to carry out
  applicable Federal and state laws, regulations, and stipulations relevant to outer
  continental shelf operations both onshore and offshore.
