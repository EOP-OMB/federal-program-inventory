objective: "TThe funding provided by Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) will among\
  \ other things, assist eligible households that have difficulty making timely payments\
  \ of rent and utilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Division N, Title V, Section\
  \ 501 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, CAA Pub. L. No. 116-260, (December\
  \ 27, 2020) established the Emergency Rental Assistance (\u201CERA 1\u201D) and\
  \ provides $25 billion for the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to make\
  \ payments to States (defined to include the District of Columbia), U.S. Territories\
  \ (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American\
  \ Samoa), Indian Tribes or their Tribally designated housing entities, as applicable,\
  \ the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL), and certain local governments with\
  \ more than 200,000 residents (collectively the \u201Celigible grantees\u201D) to\
  \ provide financial assistance including payment of rent, rental arrears, utilities\
  \ and home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, other costs related\
  \ to housing, and housing stability services to eligible households. The authorizing\
  \ statute instructed Treasury to make direct payments to the eligible grantees no\
  \ later than 30 days after December 27, 2020. Title III, Subtitle B, Section 3201\
  \ of the American Rescue Plan Act, 2021, (ARPA), Pub. L. No. 117-2, (March 11, 2021)\
  \ authorized the Emergency Rental Assistance (\u201CERA 2\u201D) and provides $21.55\
  \ billion for Treasury to make payments to States (defined to include the District\
  \ of Columbia), U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern\
  \ Mariana Islands, and American Samoa), and certain local governments with more\
  \ than 200,000 residents (collectively the \u201Celigible grantees\u201D) to provide\
  \ financial assistance including payment of rent, rental arrears, utilities and\
  \ home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, other costs related\
  \ to housing, and housing stability services to eligible households, as well as\
  \ to cover the cost of other affordable rental housing and eviction prevention activities,\
  \ as defined by the Secretary, serving very low-income families. ERA 2\u2019s authorizing\
  \ statute provided for Treasury to pay all ERA 2 eligible grantees at least 40%\
  \ of each grantee\u2019s total allocations within 60 days after March 11, 2021,\
  \ pursuant to section 3201(c) (1) of ARPA."

- description: "ERA 1 and ERA 2 grantees have continued to provide financial assistance\
    \ for services listed above. Through December 2022, ERA 1 and ERA 2 grantees made\
    \ over 10.8 million payments to eligible households and spent or obligated more\
    \ than $38.4 billion in ERA funds. The majority of ERA-funded rental assistance\
    \ has gone to keeping the lowest-income families in their homes. Over 80 percent\
    \ of ERA assistance has been delivered to assist very low-income households\u2014\
    defined as those earning 50 percent of area median income and below. More than\
    \ 60 percent of those who received assistance identified as Black or Latino. Single\
    \ mothers and other female-headed households make up close to two thirds of ERA\
    \ beneficiaries. In addition to providing direct support to hundreds of thousands\
    \ of eligible households, ERA funding has been an important catalyst for the development\
    \ of hundreds of new state- and local-level programs and initiatives that are\
    \ now providing eviction diversion services, access to legal counsel, and other\
    \ housing stability services for eligible individuals and families. Research shows\
    \ that as a result, low-income and majority Black neighborhoods that typically\
    \ see a disproportionate share of eviction cases have experienced the largest\
    \ absolute reduction in eviction filings. ERA, in combination with other pandemic\
    \ response initiatives, kept millions of families in their homes and averted what\
    \ many predicted would be a wave of evictions during the pandemic. For more information\
    \ about ERA see: https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/emergency-rental-assistance-program."
