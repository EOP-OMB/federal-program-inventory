objective: "The funding provided by Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) will among other\
  \ things, assist eligible households that have difficulty making timely payments\
  \ of rent and utilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Division N, Title V, Section\
  \ 501 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, CAA Pub. L. No. 116-260, (December\
  \ 27, 2020) established the Emergency Rental Assistance (“ERA 1”) and provided $25\
  \ billion for the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to make payments to\
  \ States (defined to include the District of Columbia), U.S. Territories (Puerto\
  \ Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa),\
  \ Indian Tribes or their Tribally designated housing entities, as applicable, the\
  \ Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL), and certain local governments with more\
  \ than 200,000 residents (collectively the “eligible grantees”) to provide financial\
  \ assistance including payment of rent, rental arrears, utilities and home energy\
  \ costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, other costs related to housing,\
  \ and housing stability services to eligible households. \nThe authorizing statute\
  \ instructed Treasury to make direct payments to the eligible grantees no later\
  \ than 30 days after December 27, 2020. ERA1 ended in December 2022 as the period\
  \ of performance for the initial allocation of ERA1 awards expired on September\
  \ 30, 2022, and for reallocated funds expired on December 29, 2022.\n\nTitle III,\
  \ Subtitle B, Section 3201 of the American Rescue Plan Act, 2021, (ARPA), Pub. L.\
  \ No. 117-2, (March 11, 2021) authorized the Emergency Rental Assistance (“ERA 2”)\
  \ and provides $21.55 billion for Treasury to make payments to States (defined to\
  \ include the District of Columbia), U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin\
  \ Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa), and certain local\
  \ governments with more than 200,000 residents (collectively the “eligible grantees”)\
  \ to provide financial assistance including payment of rent, rental arrears, utilities\
  \ and home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, other costs related\
  \ to housing, and housing stability services to eligible households, as well as\
  \ to cover the cost of other affordable rental housing and eviction prevention activities,\
  \ as defined by the Secretary, serving very low-income families. ERA 2’s authorizing\
  \ statute provided for Treasury to pay all ERA 2 eligible grantees at least 40%\
  \ of each grantee’s total allocations within 60 days after March 11, 2021, pursuant\
  \ to section 3201(c) (1) of ARPA. ERA2 is ongoing as the period of performance on\
  \ ERA2 awards end on September 30, 2025.  \nNo new awards are being made but existing\
  \ projects are still active."

- description: 'ERA 1: Payments were made directly to States, certain eligible local
    governments, U.S. Territories, DHHL, and Indian tribes to provide financial assistance
    including payment of rent, rental arrears, utilities and home energy costs, utilities
    and home energy costs arrears, other costs related to housing, and housing stability
    services for eligible households. ERA 2: Payments were made directly to States,
    certain eligible local governments, and U.S. Territories to provide financial
    assistance including payment of rent, rental arrears, utilities and home energy
    costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, other costs related to housing,
    housing stability services for eligible households, and to cover the costs for
    other affordable rental housing and eviction prevention activities for eligible
    households.'

- description: 'ERA 2 grantees have continued to provide financial assistance for
    services listed above. Through March 2024, ERA 1 and ERA 2 grantees made over
    13.9 million payments to eligible households and spent or obligated more than
    $41.9 billion in ERA funds. The majority of ERA-funded rental assistance has gone
    to keeping the lowest-income families in their homes. Over 80 percent of ERA assistance
    has been delivered to assist very low-income households—defined as those earning
    50 percent of area median income and below. More than 60 percent of those who
    received assistance identified as Black or Latino. Single mothers and other female-headed
    households make up close to two thirds of ERA beneficiaries. In addition to providing
    direct support to hundreds of thousands of eligible households, ERA funding has
    been an important catalyst for the development of hundreds of new state- and local-level
    programs and initiatives that are now providing eviction diversion services, access
    to legal counsel, and other housing stability services for eligible individuals
    and families. Research shows that as a result, low-income and majority Black neighborhoods
    that typically see a disproportionate share of eviction cases have experienced
    the largest absolute reduction in eviction filings. ERA, in combination with other
    pandemic response initiatives, kept millions of families in their homes and averted
    what many predicted would be a wave of evictions during the pandemic. For more
