objective: "The purpose of this program is to reduce Americansâ€™ sodium intake to limits\
  \ recommended by the Dietary Guidelines.  Because the majority of sodium that people\
  \ consume is already present in foods before purchase or preparation, reducing sodium\
  \ intake may require increased availability and accessibility of lower sodium items.\
  \  Efforts to reduce sodium in the food supply are occurring at a national level;\
  \ however movement is also needed at the community level to affect change.  Because\
  \ community-wide efforts to reduce sodium intake are relatively new, more practice-based\
  \ evidence would support identification and refinement of effective strategies.\
  \  Therefore, this program will aim to implement and evaluate population-based strategies\
  \ to increase access to lower sodium food in communities, and decrease sodium intake.\r\
