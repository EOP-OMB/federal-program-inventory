objective: "The purpose of this program is to reduce Americans\u2019 sodium intake\
  \ to limits recommended by the Dietary Guidelines.  Because the majority of sodium\
  \ that people consume is already present in foods before purchase or preparation,\
  \ reducing sodium intake may require increased availability and accessibility of\
  \ lower sodium items.  Efforts to reduce sodium in the food supply are occurring\
  \ at a national level; however movement is also needed at the community level to\
  \ affect change.  Because community-wide efforts to reduce sodium intake are relatively\
  \ new, more practice-based evidence would support identification and refinement\
  \ of effective strategies.  Therefore, this program will aim to implement and evaluate\
  \ population-based strategies to increase access to lower sodium food in communities,\
  \ and decrease sodium intake.\r\n"
