objective: The Cultural Antiquities Task Force (CATF) comprises U.S. federal agencies
  that share a common mission to combat trafficking in antiquities in the United States
  and abroad. The CATF supports projects and initiatives that enhance the capabilities
  of law enforcement personnel, heritage site managers, civil society groups, and
  museum staff to protect and preserve cultural heritage from theft, looting, and
  trafficking.  Projects are funded through Cultural Property Agreement Implementation
  Grants (CPAIG) or directly on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the
  CATF.
