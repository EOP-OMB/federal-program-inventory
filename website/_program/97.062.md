objective: 'In support of the Science and Technology Directorate''s mission to build
  a pipeline of diverse talent knowledgeable in the Department of Homeland Security,
  the Office of University Programs administers the Scientific Leadership Awards (SLA)
  for Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). SLAs fund homeland security-related science,
  technology, engineering, and mathematics research at MSIs and supplement existing
  academic institution curricula with homeland security challenges to prepare MSI
  students for successful careers within the homeland security enterprise. OBJECTIVES:
  (1) provide advanced professional and research development opportunities for fellows,
  scholars and faculty in targeted areas; (2)increase the intellectual capacity, skills
  and talents, especially those of U.S. citizens in areas of relevance to homeland
  security; (3) to attract undergraduate and graduate students to obtain advanced
  degrees in disciplines of importance to homeland security;  and (4) to increase
  the diversity of and highly talented cadre of new and emerging science and technology
  expertise working in areas of importance and need to homeland security.'

- description: "Five (six awards - two at the same school) Minority Serving Institutions\
    \ to include three HBCU received upwards of $470,000 each for a total of $2,810,178\
    \ in SLA funding.\n\nPerformer Accomplishments:\nProposal Title\tPI\tAccomplishment\
    \ 1\nBuilding Cyber Intelligence Workforce Through AI-Based Cybersecurity Education\
    \ and Training\tDr. Mais Nijim\tDuring FY21, a university-level cybersecurity\
    \ curriculum was developed, completed all the approval channels, and started offering\
    \ courses. 12 students were enrolled by the fall 2021 semester to bolster cyber\
    \ intelligence workforce.\nCommunity Resilience Engaging Advanced Training and\
    \ Education (C.R.E.A.T.E)\tDr. Jessica Murphy\tDuring FY21, three virtual townhall\
    \ meetings were held and seven videos were developed to disseminate community\
    \ resiliency information and educate students and community members on disaster\
    \ preparedness\nIncreasing Awareness of Natural Disasters through the Implementation\
    \ of Newly Emerging Technology in Research and Education\tDr. Duanjun Lu\tDuring\
    \ FY21, seven undergraduate students were recruited for the stipend/tuition scholarship\
    \ and six for the summer internship program. The students represent Jackson State\
    \ University (5) and Copiah-Lincoln, and the community college partner (2), as\
    \ well as six different majors/disciplines, which allowed for interdisciplinary\
    \ learning.\nUDC Homeland Security - STEM Project\tDr. Angelyn Spaulding Flowers\t\
    During FY21, two university-level courses were developed and offered, \"Predictive\
    \ Analysis in Homeland Security\" (graduate course), that in addition to teaching\
    \ new knowledge and skills, support the research necessary in developing a simulation\
    \ tool prototype; and \"Introduction to Critical Infrastructure\" (undergraduate\
    \ course), which incorporates virtual reality experiences and acquisition of certifications\
    \ in cybersecurity, emergency management (FEMA-EMI independent study courses),\
    \ and OSHA.\nDUST: Ultra-large Scale Miniature UV based AI Platform for Border\
    \ Protection\tDr. Tohid Sardarmehni\tDuring FY21, four students were recruited\
    \ to learn about supervised learning, deep learning, and machine vision. Student\
    \ progress was assessed through periodic qualifying exams and detailed student\
    \ activity reports. The student reports demonstrated the understanding of the\
    \ key AI concepts and the ability of the students to apply these concepts in UAV\
    \ performance enhancement tasks, which support student contribution to the overall\
    \ proposed research.\nTransportation Resilient Under Catastrophic Events (TRUCE)\t\
    Dr. Deo Chimba\tDuring FY21, tTwo scholarship supported undergraduate students\
    \ participated in summer research virtually that led to preparation of five technical\
    \ papers submitted to the Transportation Review Board. During this time the research\
    \ group learned about the FLEET simulation tool. This tool is helping them create\
    \ different “short notice evacuation” scenarios on roadways and estimate response\
    \ time in real time, which will contribute to increased transportation resiliency\
    \ under catastraphiccatastrophic events."
