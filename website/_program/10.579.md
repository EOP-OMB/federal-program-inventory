objective: "National School Lunch Program (NSLP) Equipment Assistance Grants are competitively\
  \ awarded subgrants to local educational agencies and schools to purchase equipment,\
  \ with a value of greater than $1,000, needed to serve healthier meals, improve\
  \ food safety, and to help support the establishment, maintenance, or expansion\
  \ of the School Breakfast Program.\n\nAdministrative Review and Training (ART) grants\
  \ are awarded to State agencies to conduct additional administrative reviews of\
  \ selected local educational agencies and to provide funding for state agencies\
  \ to be used for oversight and training of administrative personnel on application,\
  \ certification, verification, meal counting, and meal claiming procedures. \n\n\
  Direct Certification Improvement Grants are awarded to assist States agencies in\
  \ improving their direct certification processes and rates.\n\nSummer Electronic\
  \ Benefits Transfer for Children demonstrations develop and test innovative methods\
  \ of providing access to food for children during the summer months when schools\
  \ are not in regular session to reduce or eliminate the food insecurity and hunger\
  \ of children, and improve the nutritional status of children. Participating States\
  \ and Tribal Nations provide Summer EBT food benefits on debit cards to eligible\
  \ low-income families with school-age children during the summer months, giving\
  \ them more resources to use at retail food stores. \n\nGrants to Improve Health\
  \ and Nutrition were previously available to State agencies for projects that were\
  \ aimed at improving the health and wellness of children in child care settings.\
  \ \n\nSchool Breakfast Expansion grants are available to eligible State agencies\
  \ to provide sub-grants to local educational agencies for qualifying schools to\
  \ establish, maintain, or expand the School Breakfast Program.\n\nMeals to You is\
  \ a cooperative agreement between USDA and the Baylor University Collaborative on\
  \ Hunger and Poverty to provide crucial nutrition to eligible children nationwide\
  \ who live in rural areas where traditional congregate SFSP sites have historically\
  \ been unsuccessful due to the lack of transportation. This project expanded to\
  \ address the needs of eligible children affected by COVID-19 school closures.\n\
  \nHealthy Meals Incentives Recognition Awards and Sub-Grants for School Food Authorities\
  \ is a cooperative agreement between USDA and Action for Healthy Kids to improve\
  \ the nutritional quality of school meals. Healthy Meals Incentives Initiative Supplemental\
  \ Marketing and Communications is a cooperative agreement between USDA and Action\
  \ for Healthy Kids to implement marketing and communications efforts to foster the\
  \ sharing of best practices among School Food Authorities across the country as\
  \ they implement the school meal standards in the Final Rule titled, “Child Nutrition\
  \ Programs: Meal Patterns Consistent With the 202-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.”\
  \ Healthy Meals Incentives Initiative Spring 2024 Healthy Meals Summit was a cooperative\
  \ agreement between USDA and Action for Healthy Kids to convene Healthy Meals Incentives\
  \ small and rural grantees to discuss grant projects and share innovative ideas\
  \ for improving the nutritional quality of school meals."
