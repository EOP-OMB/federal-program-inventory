objective: "National School Lunch Program (NSLP) Equipment Assistance Grants are competitively\
  \ awarded subgrants to local educational agencies and schools to purchase equipment,\
  \ with a value of greater than $1,000, needed to serve healthier meals, improve\
  \ food safety, and to help support the establishment, maintenance, or expansion\
  \ of the School Breakfast Program.\n\nAdministrative Review and Training (ART) grants\
  \ are awarded to State agencies to conduct additional administrative reviews of\
  \ selected local educational agencies and to provide funding for state agencies\
  \ to be used for oversight and training of administrative personnel on application,\
  \ certification, verification, meal counting, and meal claiming procedures. \n\n\
  Direct Certification Improvement Grants have been previously awarded to assist States\
  \ agencies in improving their direct certification processes and rates.\n\nSummer\
  \ Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children demonstrations develop and test innovative\
  \ methods of providing access to food for children during the summer months when\
  \ schools are not in regular session to reduce or eliminate the food insecurity\
  \ and hunger of children, and improve the nutritional status of children. Participating\
  \ States and Tribal Nations provide Summer EBT food benefits on debit cards to eligible\
  \ low-income families with school-age children during the summer months, giving\
  \ them more resources to use at retail food stores. \n\nGrants to Improve Health\
  \ and Nutrition were previously available to State agencies for projects that were\
  \ aimed at improving the health and wellness of children in child care settings.\
  \ \n\nSchool Breakfast Expansion grants are available to eligible State agencies\
  \ to provide sub-grants to local educational agencies for qualifying schools to\
  \ establish, maintain, or expand the School Breakfast Program.\n\nMeals to You is\
  \ a cooperative agreement between USDA and the Baylor University Collaborative on\
  \ Hunger and Poverty to provide crucial nutrition to eligible children nationwide\
  \ who live in rural areas where traditional congregate SFSP sites have historically\
  \ been unsuccessful due to the lack of transportation. This project expanded to\
  \ address the needs of eligible children affected by COVID-19 school closures."
