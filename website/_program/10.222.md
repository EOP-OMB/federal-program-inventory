- description: The Tribal Colleges Endowment Program is an interest-bearing account.
    Congress appropriates funding for this account annually. Each 1994 Land-Grant
    University receives an annual funding allotment based in part on the previous
    year's interest earned and the number of American Indian students attending the
    institution. The 1994 Land-Grant presidents can use these funds at their discretion.
    They may restore or upgrade infrastructure, supplement other NIFA grants, or keep
    the funding indefinitely as a resource to address future or unanticipated needs.
    There are no projects that are submitted to NIFA for this program and the annual
    interest is split between the schools in a formula basis.
