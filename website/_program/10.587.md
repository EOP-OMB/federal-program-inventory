objective: "The Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN), formerly known as the National\
  \ Food Service Management Institute (NFMSI) is part of the School of Applied Science\
  \ at The University of Mississippi and is the only federally funded national center\
  \ dedicated to applied research, education and training, and technical assistance\
  \ for Child Nutrition Programs. The Institute was established and authorized by\
  \ Congress, in 1989, and funded at The University of Mississippi in 1991 by a grant\
  \ administered through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food\
  \ and Nutrition Service (FNS). In 1994, the Institute was permanently authorized.\
  \ The specific duties (described below) of the Institute can be found in section\
  \ 21 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. 1769b-1.\n\n\
  Administration and Staffing Grant:\nThe Institute receives $5,000,000 through a\
  \ non-competitive grant each year as stipulated in section 21 of the Richard B.\
  \ Russell National School Lunch Act, as amended and reauthorized, for activities\
  \ that include training, applied research, preparation of informational materials\
  \ and maintenance of an information clearinghouse. The grant funds staff positions\
  \ in the Institute\u2019s four divisions: Education and Training, Information Services,\
  \ Applied Research and Administration.\n\nGeneral Education Cooperative Agreement:\n\
  The Institute receives $800,000 - $2,000,000 for general education through a non-competitive\
  \ cooperative agreement. The general education agreement supports activities under\
  \ Team Nutrition. Team Nutrition is a USDA initiative to support the Child Nutrition\
  \ Programs through training and technical assistance for foodservice, nutrition\
  \ education for children and their caregivers, and school and community support\
  \ for healthy eating and physical activity. In addition, the FNS Office of Food\
  \ Safety provides funding to support its mission of increasing awareness, visibility,\
  \ and impact of food safety on USDA nutrition assistance programs. The Institute\
  \ provides support to the FNS Office of Food Safety for developing food safety education\
  \ programs and materials and conducting applied research related to food safety\
  \ education (non-competitive). A complete description is at CFDA 10.585 \u201CFNS\
  \ Food Safety Grants.\u201D\n\nMission and Vision:\nThe Institute's mission is to\
  \ provide relevant research-based information and services that promote the continuous\
  \ improvement of Child Nutrition Programs. The vision is to lead the nation in providing\
  \ education, research, and resources to promote excellence in Child Nutrition Programs.\
  \ The Institute serves anyone connected with the Child Nutrition Programs: National\
  \ School Lunch, School Breakfast, Summer Food Service, and Child and Adult Care\
  \ Food Programs. As a national center, and to fulfill its mission, the Institute\
  \ develops educational resources, and offers training and technical assistance using\
  \ appropriate technology for child nutrition professionals across the nation and\
  \ conducts applied research. It is the training and technical assistance arm of\
  \ the Child Nutrition Programs."
