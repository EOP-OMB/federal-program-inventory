objective: 'The Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN), formerly known as the National
  Food Service Management Institute (NFMSI) is part of the School of Applied Science
  at The University of Mississippi and is the only federally funded national center
  dedicated to applied research, education and training, and technical assistance
  for Child Nutrition Programs. The Institute was established and authorized by Congress,
  in 1989, and funded at The University of Mississippi in 1991 by a grant administered
  through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Nutrition Service
  (FNS). In 1994, the Institute was permanently authorized. The specific duties (described
  below) of the Institute can be found in section 21 of the Richard B. Russell National
  School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. 1769b-1.


  Administration and Staffing Grant:

  The Institute receives $5,000,000 through a non-competitive grant each year as stipulated
  in section 21 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, as amended and
  reauthorized, for activities that include training, applied research, preparation
  of informational materials and maintenance of an information clearinghouse. The
  grant funds staff positions in the Institute’s four divisions: Education and Training,
  Information Services, Applied Research and Administration.


  General Education Cooperative Agreement:

  The Institute receives $800,000 - $2,000,000 for general education through a non-competitive
  cooperative agreement. The general education agreement supports activities under
  Team Nutrition. Team Nutrition is a USDA initiative to support the Child Nutrition
  Programs through training and technical assistance for foodservice, nutrition education
  for children and their caregivers, and school and community support for healthy
  eating and physical activity. In addition, the FNS Office of Food Safety provides
  funding to support its mission of increasing awareness, visibility, and impact of
  food safety on USDA nutrition assistance programs. The Institute provides support
  to the FNS Office of Food Safety for developing food safety education programs and
  materials and conducting applied research related to food safety education (non-competitive).
  A complete description is at CFDA 10.585 “FNS Food Safety Grants.”
