objective: The Money Follows the Person (MFP) Rebalancing Demonstration, authorized
  by section 6071 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171), was designed
  to assist States to balance their long-term care systems and help Medicaid enrollees
  transition from institutions to the community. Congress initially authorized up
  to $1.75 billion in Federal funds through Fiscal Year (FFY) 2011. With the subsequent
  passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) in 2010,
  section 2403 extended the program through September 30, 2016. An additional $2.25
  billion in Federal funds was appropriated through FFY 2016. Since then, section
  2 of the Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-3) added $112 million in Federal
  funds and changed the end date for the program from September 30, 2016 to September
  30, 2021. Section 5 of the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of
  2019 (P.L. 116-16) changed the additional funding appropriated through the Medicaid
  Extenders Act from $112 million to $132 million and section 4 of the Sustaining
  Excellence in Medicaid Act of 2019 (P.L 116-39) changed the additional funding appropriated
  through the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act from $132 million
  to $254.5 million. Section 205 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020
  (P.L. 116-94) and section 3811 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
  Act (P.L. 116-136) provided an additional $337.5 million. Section 2301 of the Continuing
  Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act (P.L. 116-159) added $66.4 million,
  section 1107 of the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021, and other Extensions
  Act (P.L. 116-215) added $6.5 million. Section 204 of the Consolidated Appropriations
  Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) added $1.253 billion, extended and made changes to the
  program. Any funds remaining at the end of each fiscal year carry over to the next
  fiscal year, and can be used to make grant awards to current grantees through FY
  2023. Any unused grant funds awarded in FY 2023 can be used through FY 2027. No
  additional funding will be available after the final 2023 awards are made; however,
  grantees will submit documentation to identify projected costs and justify expenditures
  on an annual basis. Grantees can request to continue transitioning MFP participants
  until December 31, 2025 with services being provided and eligible for MFP-enhanced
  match through December 31, 2026. All claiming of services must be finalized by September
  30, 2027. The MFP Demonstration supports State efforts to rebalance their long-term
  support system so that individuals have a choice of where they live and receive
  services. MFP program goals are (1) increase the use of home and community-based
  services (HCBS) and reduce the use of institutionally-based services; (2) eliminate
  barriers in State law, State Medicaid plans, and State budgets that restrict the
  use of Medicaid funds to let people get long-term care in the settings of their
  choice; (3) strengthen the ability of Medicaid programs to provide HCBS to people
  who choose to transition out of institutions,; and (4) put procedures in place to
  provide quality assurance and improvement of HCBS. The demonstration provides for
  enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for 12 months for qualified
  home and community-based services for each person transitioned from an institution
  to the community during the demonstration period. Eligibility for transition is
  dependent upon residence in a qualified institution for more than 60 consecutive
  days. The State must continue to provide community-based services after the 12-month
  period for as long as the person needs community services and is Medicaid eligible.
  Under the demonstration, the State must propose a system of Medicaid home and community-based
  care that will be sustained after the demonstration period and is deemed qualified
  by the Secretary. Specifically, the program must be conducted in conjunction with
  a "qualified HCBS program" which is a program that is in operation (or approved)
  in the State for such individuals in a manner that assures continuity of Medicaid
  coverage of services in the qualified HCBS program for eligible individuals. States
  may also propose to enhance the services they will provide during the demonstration
  period to achieve greater success with transition. States will be required to participate
  in a national qualitative and quantitative evaluation conducted by CMS. Data collected
  on a national level will help evaluate the core objectives of the statute.
