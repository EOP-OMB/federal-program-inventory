objective: 'Diabetes Prevention and Control Programs (DPCPs) are funded by the CDC''s
  Division of Diabetes Translation to address the following national level goals:

  1) Prevent diabetes.

  2) Prevent the complications, disabilities, and burden associated with diabetes.

  3) Eliminate diabetes-related health disparities.

  4) Maximize organizational capacity to achieve the National Diabetes Program goals.


  DPCPs aim to achieve system and population-level change and, ultimately, to improve
  health outcomes by coordinating and leveraging the efforts of the statewide diabetes
  community.  They are responsible for establishing partnerships with key organizations
  in support of the national goals stated above, and for implementing and evaluating
  evidence-based interventions in three main areas: 1. Intervention #1: Improve quality
  of clinical care for populations with greatest diabetes burden and risk to improve
  control of A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and to promote tobacco cessation.  2.
  Intervention #2: Increase access to sustainable self-management education and support
  services for populations with greatest diabetes burden and risk to improve control
  of A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and to promote tobacco cessation.  3. Intervention
  #3: Increase use of lifestyle change programs that have achieved CDC recognition
  (or pending recognition) to prevent or delay onset of type 2 diabetes among people
  at high risk.


  Assist State and local health authorities and other health related organizations
  in controlling communicable diseases, chronic diseases and disorders and other preventable
  health conditions.  Provide specific health surveillance using telephone and multi-mode
  survey methodologies for the behaviors of the general population that contribute
  to the occurrences and prevention of chronic diseases, injuries and other public
  health threats.  The collection, analysis and dissemination of Behavioral Risk Factor
  Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to state and territorial health department categorical
  programs is used for assessing trends, directing program planning, evaluating program
  priorities, developing policies and targeting relevant population groups.'
