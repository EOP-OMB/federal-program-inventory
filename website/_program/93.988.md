objective: "Diabetes Prevention and Control Programs (DPCPs) are funded by the CDC's\
  \ Division of Diabetes Translation to address the following national level goals:\r\
  \n1) Prevent diabetes.\r\n2) Prevent the complications, disabilities, and burden\
  \ associated with diabetes.\r\n3) Eliminate diabetes-related health disparities.\r\
  \n4) Maximize organizational capacity to achieve the National Diabetes Program goals.\r\
  \n\r\nDPCPs aim to achieve system and population-level change and, ultimately, to\
  \ improve health outcomes by coordinating and leveraging the efforts of the statewide\
  \ diabetes community.  They are responsible for establishing partnerships with key\
  \ organizations in support of the national goals stated above, and for implementing\
  \ and evaluating evidence-based interventions in three main areas: 1. Intervention\
  \ #1: Improve quality of clinical care for populations with greatest diabetes burden\
  \ and risk to improve control of A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and to promote\
  \ tobacco cessation.  2. Intervention #2: Increase access to sustainable self-management\
  \ education and support services for populations with greatest diabetes burden and\
  \ risk to improve control of A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and to promote\
  \ tobacco cessation.  3. Intervention #3: Increase use of lifestyle change programs\
  \ that have achieved CDC recognition (or pending recognition) to prevent or delay\
  \ onset of type 2 diabetes among people at high risk.\r\n\r\nAssist State and local\
  \ health authorities and other health related organizations in controlling communicable\
  \ diseases, chronic diseases and disorders and other preventable health conditions.\
  \  Provide specific health surveillance using telephone and multi-mode survey methodologies\
  \ for the behaviors of the general population that contribute to the occurrences\
  \ and prevention of chronic diseases, injuries and other public health threats.\
  \  The collection, analysis and dissemination of BRFSS data to state and territorial\
  \ health department categorical programs is used for assessing trends, directing\
  \ program planning, evaluating program priorities, developing policies and targeting\
  \ relevant population groups."
