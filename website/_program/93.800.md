objective: The purpose of the program is to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
  rates among an applicant-defined target population of persons 50-75 years of age
  within partner health system(s), defined geographical areas, or disparate populations.
  This program will fund implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and
  other strategies in partnership with health systems with the goal of instituting
  organized screening programs. In addition, this program will fund a small number
  of awardees to pay for direct screening and follow-up services for a limited number
  of individuals that belong to the program priority population.
