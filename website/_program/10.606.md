objective: 'In order to use the food resources of the United States more effectively
  in support of developing countries, and countries that are emerging democracies
  that have made commitments to introduce or expand free enterprise elements in their
  agricultural economies through changes in commodity pricing, marketing, input availability,
  distribution, and private sector involvement, Food for Progress (FFPr) furnishes
  agricultural commodities to those countries, which are then sold. The proceeds from
  those sales is used to provide technical assistance intended to improve agricultural
  productivity in those countries, and to expand trade of agricultural products to,
  from, and within those countries.


  Program effectiveness is tracked against 24 standard indicators relating to increased
  agricultural productivity, improved land and water resource quality, use of financial
  services, institutional capacity, leverage of private sector resources, post-harvest
  infrastructure, and expansion of agricultural trade.'
