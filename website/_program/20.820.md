- description: "Through a Cooperative Agreement signed in 2016, MARAD and SOCP worked\
    \ together to develop, produce, distribute, and promote the use of a Computer\
    \ Based Training (CBT), consensus Best Practices/Guidance Document, plus other\
    \ pertinent materials and tools (Best Practices Tool Kit) for the U.S. Merchant\
    \ Marine industry to address issues affecting shipboard climate in the U.S. Merchant\
    \ Marine. The specific issues addressed included sexual harassment, sexual assault,\
    \ bullying, retaliation, and other coercive behaviors. The training resources\
    \ aggressively promote a culture of zero tolerance for such behavior. The CBT\
    \ and Best Practices Tool Kit content addressed MARAD required items and best\
    \ practices. \n\nAs a result of this joint effort MARAD was provided with copies\
    \ of the DVD, and additional copies of the CBT were distributed to other maritime\
    \ industry interests. In addition to the CBT, a Best Practices Guidance Document,\
    \ and a Best Practices Tool Kit that include a SASH Classroom Facilitator Guide,\
    \ SASH Classroom Student Workbook, SASH brochures, and SASH posters were made\
    \ available to industry and the public via the web at no charge."
