objective: "The purpose of this program is to promote economic and social self-sufficiency\
  \ for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Native American\
  \ Pacific Islanders from American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern\
  \ Mariana Islands through grants or cooperative agreements for research, demonstration,\
  \ or pilot projects conducted by public or private agencies which are designed to\
  \ test or assist in the development of new approaches or methods that will aid in\
  \ overcoming special problems or otherwise further the purposes of the Native American\
  \ Programs Act. In Fiscal Year 2016, ANA offered funds for community-based projects\
  \ to build upon the successes of ANA\u2019s short-term project-based Native Language\
  \ funding, under the Native Language Community Coordination (NLCC) initiative. This\
  \ funding was intended as a place-based demonstration to address gaps in a community\u2019\
  s coordination of Native language programming across the educational continuum from\
  \ birth to higher education."
