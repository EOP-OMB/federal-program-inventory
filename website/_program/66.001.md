objective: 'The objectives of the §105 program are to assist state, tribal, municipal,
  intermunicipal, and interstate air pollution control agencies in planning, developing,
  establishing, improving, and maintaining adequate programs for the continuing prevention
  and control of air pollution, and/or in the implementation of national primary and
  secondary air quality standards.  The continuing activities funded under Section
  105 include: analysis and planning for attainment and maintenance of NAAQS; emission
  reduction measures; development and operation of air quality monitoring networks,
  and other air program activities. Specific expectations and deliverables are established
  through negotiations in grant agreements between regions and air pollution control
  agencies. EPA is prepared to work collaboratively with air agencies to adjust resources
  to meet changing priorities. The Office of Air and Radiation''s National Program
  Guidance identifies key priorities and activities expected to be undertaken by EPA
  Headquarters and Regional offices and implementing air agencies in national areas
  of focus. OAR’s current NP Guidance can be found at https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/national-program-guidances.
  The monitoring guidance outlines monitoring priorities, quality assurance programs,
  and funding projections. The monitoring appendix may be accessed at https://www.epa.gov/amtic/national-program-manager-npm-guidance-monitoring-appendix.'

results:
- description: Not available Annual emissions estimates are used as one indicator
    of the effectiveness of our programs. Between 1970 and 2016, gross domestic product
    increased 253 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased 190 percent, energy consumption
    increased 44 percent, and U.S. population grew by 58 percent. During the same
    time period, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 73
    percent. Each year EPA tracks the levels of these pollutants in the air and how
    much of each pollutant (or the pollutants that form them) is emitted from various
    pollution sources. The agency looks at these numbers year after year to see how
    the pollutants have changed over time. EPA posts the results of our analyses at
    www.epa.gov/airtrends.

    Annual emissions estimates are used as one indicator of the effectiveness of our
    programs. Between 1980 and 2014, gross domestic product increased 147 percent,
    vehicle miles traveled increased 97 percent, energy consumption increased 26 percent,
    and U.S. population grew by 41 percent. During the same time period, total emissions
    of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 63 percent. Between 1980 and 2013,
    CO2 emissions increased by 17 percent. Each year EPA tracks the levels of these
    pollutants in the air and how much of each pollutant (or the pollutants that form
    them) is emitted from various pollution sources. The agency looks at these numbers
    year after year to see how the pollutants have changed over time.'
