objective: "The objectives of the \xA7105 program are to assist state, tribal, municipal,\
  \ intermunicipal, and interstate air pollution control agencies in planning, developing,\
  \ establishing, improving, and maintaining adequate programs for the continuing\
  \ prevention and control of air pollution, and/or in the implementation of national\
  \ primary and secondary air quality standards.  The continuing activities funded\
  \ under Section 105 include: analysis and planning for attainment and maintenance\
  \ of NAAQS; emission reduction measures; development and operation of air quality\
  \ monitoring networks, and other air program activities. Specific expectations and\
  \ deliverables are established through negotiations in grant agreements between\
  \ regions and air pollution control agencies. OAR encourages air pollution control\
  \ agencies to engage EPA on activities where there may be opportunities for flexibility.\
  \ The Office of Air and Radiation's National Program Guidance identifies key priorities\
  \ and activities expected to be undertaken by EPA Headquarters and Regional offices\
  \ and implementing air agencies in national areas of focus. OAR\u2019s current NP\
  \ Guidance can be found at https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/national-program-guidances.\
  \ The monitoring guidance outlines monitoring priorities, quality assurance programs,\
  \ and funding projections. The monitoring appendix may be accessed at https://www.epa.gov/amtic/national-program-manager-npm-guidance-monitoring-appendix."
