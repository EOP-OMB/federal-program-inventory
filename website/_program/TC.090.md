objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, would be included in taxable income. Dedicated payments and
  in-kind benefits represent accretions to wealth that do not differ materially from
  cash wages. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from taxable income for
  employee parking expenses that are paid for by the employer or that are received
  by the employee in lieu of wages. In 2024, the maximum amount of the parking exclusion
  is $315 per month. The tax expenditure estimate does not include any subsidy provided
  through employer-owned parking facilities. However, beginning in 2018, parking expenses
  are no longer deductible to employers.
