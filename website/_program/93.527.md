- description: The HRSA Health Center Program improves the health of the nation’s
    underserved communities and vulnerable populations by assuring access to comprehensive,
    culturally competent, quality primary health care services. The Health Center
    Program provides patient-centered, comprehensive, integrated care to nearly 29
    million people a year in communities across the United States through nearly 1,400
    HRSA health centers that operate more than 13,500 service delivery sites. Through
    new and expanded funding, approximately 86% of health centers are part of a network,
    and health centers have been able to implement and evaluate innovative practices
    as well as support their communities and patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic
    and expand critical services, such as HIV prevention. One-time funding to Health
    Center Program look-alikes (LALs), designated as of April 1, 2021, was provided
    to respond to and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and to enhance health care
    services and infrastructure.

    services, such as HIV prevention. One-time funding to Health Center Program look-alikes
    (LALs), was provided to respond to and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and to
    enhance health care services and infrastructure. Networks include 83% of all health

    health centers formally partnering with HCCNs. HCCNs support health centers to
    strengthen and leverage health information technology (IT) to improve access to
    care, enhance quality of care, and support practice redesign to integrate services
    and optimize patient outcomes.  Networks awards shifted to Assistance Listing
