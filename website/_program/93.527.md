- description: "The HRSA Health Center Program improves the health of the nation\u2019\
    s underserved communities and vulnerable populations by assuring access to comprehensive,\
    \ culturally competent, quality primary health care services. The Health Center\
    \ Program provides patient-centered, comprehensive, integrated care to more than\
    \ 30 million people a year in communities across the United States through nearly\
    \ 1,400 HRSA health centers that operate nearly 14,000 service delivery sites.\
    \ Through new and expanded funding, health centers have been able to implement\
    \ and evaluate innovative approaches to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce\
    \ disparities for patients at highest risk of maternal morbidity and mortality,\
    \ as well as support their communities and patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic\
    \ and expand critical services, such as HIV prevention. One-time funding to Health\
    \ Center Program look-alikes (LALs), was provided to respond to and mitigate the\
    \ spread of COVID-19, and to enhance health care services and infrastructure.\
    \ Networks include 83% of all health centers and look-alikes and strengthen and\
    \ leverage health information technology (IT) to improve health outcomes, with\
    \ nearly 100% of participating health centers using health IT for patient engagement."
