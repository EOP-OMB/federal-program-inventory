objective: "The purpose of this program is: to pay the costs of developing the standards\
  \ and high-quality assessments required by Title I of the ESEA. Once a State has\
  \ put in place those standards and assessments, it may use program funds to pay\
  \ for the administration of the assessments and for other activities related to\
  \ ensuring that the State\u2019s schools and LEAs are held accountable for results\
  \ and helping students attain challenging academic standards linked to college-\
  \ and career-readiness. Such activities may include, among other things, developing\
  \ standards and assessments in subjects other than those required by Title I, refining\
  \ State assessments to ensure continued alignment with standards, expanding the\
  \ range of testing accommodations for students with disabilities and for English\
  \ Learner students, developing multiple measures to ensure the validity and reliability\
  \ of State assessments, and using academic assessment instruments such as performance\
  \ and technology-based assessments or computer adaptive assessments to better reflect\
  \ the kind of complex work students do in an effective classroom and the real world."
