objective: 'The purpose of this program is: to pay the costs of developing the standards
  and high-quality assessments required by Title I of the ESEA. Once a State has put
  in place those standards and assessments, it may use program funds to pay for the
  administration of the assessments and for other activities related to ensuring that
  the Stateâ€™s schools and LEAs are held accountable for results and helping students
  attain challenging academic standards linked to college- and career-readiness. Such
  activities may include, among other things, developing standards and assessments
  in subjects other than those required by Title I, refining State assessments to
  ensure continued alignment with standards, expanding the range of testing accommodations
  for students with disabilities and for English Learner students, developing multiple
  measures to ensure the validity and reliability of State assessments, and using
  academic assessment instruments such as performance and technology-based assessments
  or computer adaptive assessments to better reflect the kind of complex work students
  do in an effective classroom and the real world.'
