objective: "The Transforming Maternal Health (TMaH) Model, is a voluntary, 10-year\
  \ delivery and payment model promoting improved maternal health care outcomes.\n\
  The TMaH model will test whether funded targeted technical assistance, coupled with\
  \ payment and delivery system reforms, can drive a whole-person care-delivery approach\
  \ to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care while reducing Medicaid and CHIP\
  \ program expenditures. \nCMS will evaluate: TMaH’s impact on rates of low-risk\
  \ cesarean section (c-section), severe maternal morbidity (SMM), incidence of low\
  \ birthweight infants, changes in experience of care for pregnant and birthing people,\
  \ and changes in program expenditures."
