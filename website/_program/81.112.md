objective: (1) To grow the U.S. scientific community through university involvement
  in areas of fundamental science and technology relevant to stockpile stewardship;
  (2) to promote and sustain scientific interactions between the academic community
  and scientists at the NNSA laboratories; (3) to train scientists in specific areas
  of long-term research relevant to stockpile stewardship; (4) to increase the availability
  of unique experimental facilities sited at NNSA's laboratories to the academic community,
  particularly for collaborations in areas of relevance to stockpile stewardship;
  and (5) to develop and maintain a long-term recruiting pipeline to NNSA's laboratories
  by increasing the visibility of NNSA's Defense Program's scientific activities to
  the U.S. faculty and student communities.
