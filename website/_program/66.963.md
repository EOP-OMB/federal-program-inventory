objective: "Grants are awarded to support projects that meet two criteria: 1) They\
  \ must be located in and directly benefit one or more Target Investment Areas and\
  \ 2) They must achieve measurable environmental and public health results in one\
  \ or more of the Target Program Areas. Target Investment Areas and Target Program\
  \ Areas are identified in the annual competitive funding announcement. Funds for\
  \ all projects should support activities to provide education, outreach, or training\
  \ in the Target Program Areas. The Regional Office will only accept submissions\
  \ for projects that affect the states, tribes, and territories within the five Region\
  \ 6 states: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. Projects that\
  \ are national in scope are not eligible for funding under this regional program.\
  \ The statutory authorities for this program restrict the use of assistance agreements\
  \ to support the following activities: conducting or promoting the coordination\
  \ and acceleration of research, investigations, experiments, training, demonstrations,\
  \ surveys, and studies relating to the causes, effects (including health and welfare\
  \ effects), extent, prevention, and elimination of pollution. Demonstrations must\
  \ involve new or experimental technologies, methods, or approaches, and it is encouraged\
  \ that the results of these projects will be disseminated so that others can benefit\
  \ from the knowledge gained. A project that is accomplished through the performance\
  \ of routine, traditional, or established practices, or a project that is simply\
  \ intended to carry out a task rather than transfer information or advance the state\
  \ of knowledge, however worthwhile the project might be, is not considered a demonstration\
  \ project.\n\nFunding Priority \u2013 Fiscal Year 2023 \u2013 Clean, Green, and\
  \ Healthy Schools: Projects that focus on creating clean, green, and healthy school\
  \ environments by promoting EPA\u2019s State School Environmental Health Guidelines;\
  \ EPA\u2019s Voluntary Guidelines for Selecting Safer School Location and their\
  \ design, construction, and renovation; EPA\u2019s 3Ts for Reducing Lead in Drinking\
  \ Water in Schools, and/or implementing replicable programs across Region 6 serving\
  \ children\u2019s environmental health at K-12 schools. Community and Water Infrastructure\
  \ Resilience: Projects that provide education, outreach, and training to manage\
  \ facilities at which hazardous substances are located; advance the emergency preparedness\
  \ and resilience of communities and water infrastructure through training related\
  \ to safer handling and removal of hazardous waste. Healthy Indoor Environments:\
  \ Projects that focus on reducing and/or preventing childhood lead poisoning through\
  \ compliance assistance, outreach, and/or education on lead-based paint regulations,\
  \ and/or small drinking water systems; reducing asthma triggers; promoting integrated\
  \ pest management; promoting recycling, pollution prevention, food recovery, food\
  \ waste minimization and/or diversion, and/or renewable energy; reducing childhood\
  \ exposure to one or more toxins (lead, PCBs, dioxin, mercury, asbestos, pesticides,\
  \ etc.); and promoting comprehensive healthy homes and/or other indoor environments\
  \ for children or other sensitive populations. Healthy Outdoor Environments: Projects\
  \ that focus on reducing and/or preventing exposure to toxics and pollutants in\
  \ the air, soil, and/or water by addressing the causes, effects, extent, reduction,\
  \ prevention, and/or elimination of pollution in rivers and/or other natural resources."
