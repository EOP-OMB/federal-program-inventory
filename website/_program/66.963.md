objective: 'Grants are awarded to support projects that meet two criteria: 1) They
  must be located in and directly benefit one or more Target Investment Areas and
  2) They must achieve measurable environmental and public health results in one or
  more of the Target Program Areas. Target Investment Areas and Target Program Areas
  are identified in the annual competitive funding announcement. Funds for all projects
  should support activities to provide education, outreach, or training in the Target
  Program Areas. The Regional Office will only accept submissions for projects that
  affect the states, tribes, and territories within the five Region 6 states: Arkansas,
  Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. Projects that are national in scope
  are not eligible for funding under this regional program. The statutory authorities
  for this program restrict the use of assistance agreements to support the following
  activities: conducting or promoting the coordination and acceleration of research,
  investigations, experiments, training, demonstrations, surveys, and studies relating
  to the causes, effects (including health and welfare effects), extent, prevention,
  and elimination of pollution. Demonstrations must involve new or experimental technologies,
  methods, or approaches, and it is encouraged that the results of these projects
  will be disseminated so that others can benefit from the knowledge gained. A project
  that is accomplished through the performance of routine, traditional, or established
  practices, or a project that is simply intended to carry out a task rather than
  transfer information or advance the state of knowledge, however worthwhile the project
  might be, is not considered a demonstration project.


  Funding Priority – Fiscal Year 2023 – Clean, Green, and Healthy Schools: Projects
  that focus on creating clean, green, and healthy school environments by promoting
  EPA’s State School Environmental Health Guidelines; EPA’s Voluntary Guidelines for
  Selecting Safer School Location and their design, construction, and renovation;
  EPA’s 3Ts for Reducing Lead in Drinking Water in Schools, and/or implementing replicable
  programs across Region 6 serving children’s environmental health at K-12 schools.
  Community and Water Infrastructure Resilience: Projects that provide education,
  outreach, and training to manage facilities at which hazardous substances are located;
  advance the emergency preparedness and resilience of communities and water infrastructure
  through training related to safer handling and removal of hazardous waste. Healthy
  Indoor Environments: Projects that focus on reducing and/or preventing childhood
  lead poisoning through compliance assistance, outreach, and/or education on lead-based
  paint regulations, and/or small drinking water systems; reducing asthma triggers;
  promoting integrated pest management; promoting recycling, pollution prevention,
  food recovery, food waste minimization and/or diversion, and/or renewable energy;
  reducing childhood exposure to one or more toxins (lead, PCBs, dioxin, mercury,
  asbestos, pesticides, etc.); and promoting comprehensive healthy homes and/or other
  indoor environments for children or other sensitive populations. Healthy Outdoor
  Environments: Projects that focus on reducing and/or preventing exposure to toxics
  and pollutants in the air, soil, and/or water by addressing the causes, effects,
  extent, reduction, prevention, and/or elimination of pollution in rivers and/or
  other natural resources.'
