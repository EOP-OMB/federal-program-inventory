- description: The Poison Control Program supports 55 poison centers to provide poison
    prevention and information services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to all states
    and U.S. territories. These services include expert guidance from doctors, nurses,
    pharmacists, and other specially trained toxicology experts to manage and treat
    exposures; and consultation to health care professionals in managing complex cases
    related to toxic exposures. The program also supports poison centers to collect
    poison exposure and surveillance data for emergency preparedness and response
    and other public health emergencies. Poison centers also participate in education
    activities to prevent poisonings and toxic exposures. The program also supports
    a national toll-free Poison Help line, which receives nearly 3 million calls annually,
    and a national media campaign to educate the public and health care providers
    about poisoning and toxic exposure prevention, poison center services, and the
    toll-free number.
