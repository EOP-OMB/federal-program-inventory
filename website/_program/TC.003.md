objective: In general, all compensation received by U.S. citizens and residents is
  properly included in their taxable income. It makes no difference whether the compensation
  is a result of working abroad or whether it is labeled as an allowance for the high
  cost of living abroad. In contrast to this treatment, U.S. Federal civilian employees
  and Peace Corps members who work outside the continental United States are allowed
  to exclude from U.S. taxable income certain special allowances they receive to compensate
  them for the relatively high costs associated with living overseas. The allowances
  supplement wage income and cover expenses such as rent, education, and the cost
  of travel to and from the United States.
