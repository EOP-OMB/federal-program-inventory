objective: "The United States has made a sacred promise to its citizens that it will\
  \ bring home with dignity all those who have served. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting\
  \ Agency (DPAA) is responsible for determining the fate of our missing and, where\
  \ possible, recovering and identifying those who have made the ultimate sacrifice\
  \ on behalf of a grateful nation. \n   This program facilitates efforts to provide\
  \ the fullest possible accounting for missing Department of Defense personnel from\
  \ past conflicts and to provide answers to their families and the nation."

results:
- description: Awardees developed new and innovative approaches needed to advance
    historical research and analysis tied to the Agency's mission to find, recover,
    and identify missing military personnel lost in past conflicts, to include a nationwide
    "hub and spoke" network somewhat akin to crowdsourcing, albeit with a quality
    control aspect built in.  These new approaches identified new sources of records
    and data and provided opportunities to leverage the capabilities of external prgainizations
    and individuals, such as military unit historians and university military history
    classes.  The result has been to  increase the Agency's capability and capacity
    for historical research and analysis at a modest cost, thereby greatly enhancing
    DPAA's efforts to find missing personnel and to provide much-appreciated information
    and/or closure to the families of the missing.
  year: '2019'
- description: Despite COVID-19 travel restrictions and health and safety related
    concerns, the program continued to result in new and innovative approaches and
    processes for the Agency to work with partners for field recoveries worldwide
    and to develop information of possible loss sites where remains of missing military
    personnel could be recovered. An outside study demonstrated that these efforts
    resulted in cost avoidance even as overall Agency capacity was increased. Program
    utilized the expertise and resources of cultural resource management, archeology
    and forensic anthropology entities able to conduct terrestrial and underwater
    operations worldwide. Program directly contributed to multiple successful field
    recoveries and the recovery and return of missing military personnel lost in past
    conflicts (going back to and including WWII). Program also generated new field
    techniques and approaches that offer the potential to increase the overall efficiency
    of the Agency's field activities.
  year: '2021'
- description: FY22 constituted another positive increment in the trend line of DPAAâ€™s
    partner expansion. Despite the challenges to partner projects and PI team functionality
    with continued impacts of COVID-19, the team accelerated its level of effort in
    all key performance indicators. From the 63 planned field missions (plus a few
    others that were withdrawn), the year ended with 46 partner missions launched.
    Although every field project presents its own special blend of challenges and
    opportunities, this FY was notable for including very complex efforts in Southeast
    Asia, in very deep-water areas, and with multi-year arrangements in specific countries
    (Philippines) or to test certain approaches (mountain sites). Planning this number
    of field projects alone is commendable; the increasing complexity and productivity
    of partners demonstrates a clear maturation of the program. The PI Research Team
    (PIRT) also dramatically expanded efforts to work on 69 separate projects of varying
    complexity and scope. These efforts included some foundational research that DPAA
    staff simply does not have the time or ability to conduct as well as some focused,
    case-progression research. We expanded the number of research partners, the types
    of arrangements used to work with them, and the forms of research pursued through
    collaborative effort. Finally, as the nascent innovation program steps into being,
    over the course of FY22 we still worked on four separate pilot projects again
    of varying complexity and scope. The results and lessons learned through that
    effort will inform the agency-wide program soon to launch.
