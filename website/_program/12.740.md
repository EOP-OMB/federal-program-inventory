  \ possible, recovering and identifying those who have made the ultimate sacrifice\
  \ on behalf of a grateful nation. \n   This program facilitates efforts to provide\
  \ the fullest possible accounting for missing Department of Defense personnel from\
  \ past conflicts and to provide answers to their families and the nation."
