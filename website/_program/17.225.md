- description: 'Fiscal Year 2021: States reported $50.4 billion in state unemployment
    tax contributions and paid $217.8 billion in federal and state UI benefits to

    benefits in FY 2020 and partly due to states'' use of supplemental funding sources.
    Benefits are up in FY 2021 as the CARES Act programs remained available for nearly
    the entire fiscal year, while the number of new beneficiaries in FY 2021 declined
    from FY 2020 as many claimants carried over from the prior year.'
