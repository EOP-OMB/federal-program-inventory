objective: 'The Community Assistance Program – State Support Services Element (CAP-
  SSSE) program provides funding to states and territories  to provide technical assistance
  to communities in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and to evaluate community
  performance in implementing NFIP floodplain management activities. CAP-SSSE aligns
  with and supports DHS Strategic Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience.
  CAP- SSSE strives to leverage state knowledge and expertise to provide support to
  communities through activities that most effectively reduce flood losses. The CAP-SSSE
  cooperative agreement funds eligible activities to enable state NFIP coordinating
  agencies to meet the provisions set forth in 44 C.F.R.§ 60.25 and the goals and
  performance expectations of the funding agency: FEMA and the NFIP.'

- description: 'FY21 was the first grant year that states used the new, standardized
    Quarterly Report template which helps states track and monitor their progress
    against grant activities. State grantees used the newly developed State Activity
    Planning and Pricing (APP) Tool to provide a nationwide projection for the activities
    that would be accomplished by states in FY21. This included: 590 CAVs, 1,629 CACs,
    compliance follow-up work with another 535 communities, over 21,000 instances
    of GTA, regulation support for almost 1500 communities, 550 workshops, 140 special
    projects and more. Applied a phased approach to the new funding methodology, which
    included implementing discretionary funding (which is competitive investment funding
    for extra CAP activities, capability building, and/or special projects). 29 states
    applied for and received discretionary  funding in FY21 for hiring new staff,
    strategic planning efforts, professional development, public signage like high
    watermark art installations and more.  Implemented use of interactive dashboards
    for regions to track state progress towards performance measure targets throughout
    the year. States set their targets for: communities engaged, higher standards,
    compliance improvement, and map adoption. Today, 98% of state grantees meet or
    exceed 75% of their annual targets. Helped 1,273 communities receiving new flood
    maps adopt updated regulations. Released 12 issues of the State NFIP Coordinator
    Monthly Digest which communicates key milestones, deadlines, and announcements
    to State NFIP Coordinators. Conducted the 2022 off-cycle Tiered State Framework
    (TSF) Assessment which resulted in 6 states improving their overall score, 3 of
    which moved up a tier. The TSF defines a state’s NFIP program as below foundational,
    foundational, proficient, or advanced. TSF sets forth a process by which states
    are assessed at least every three years and aligned to a tier which guides their
    work activities and performance expectations. Released enhanced version of state
    APP Tool (and corresponding guidebook) for FY22 planning based on state feedback
    and conducted trainings to aid states in completing their SOWs for the upcoming
    grant year. Due to work in FY20 and FY21, CAP was successful in securing an additional
    $5M (a 50% increase) in overall CAP funding for future grant years.'

- description: 'Increased communication, collaboration, community engagement, trust,
    and relationships among state stakeholders.

    Customers have a better understanding of floodplain management from technical
    assistance.

    Local officials and other stakeholders increase understanding of floodplain management
    from trainings and outreach.

    Federal programs improve coordination related to floodplain management.

    State partners build their program to increase capability and capacity to effectively
    manage their floodplains.

    Communities and individuals experience decreased losses and disruption in the
    event of a flood.


    Due to success of CAP-SSSE transformation activities over the last 6 years the
    grant will receive an additional $5M in overall funding for future grant years.'
