objective: The commissions and organizations funded by this appropriation enable the
  United State to promote critical U.S. economic and conservation interests.  Each
  facilitates international cooperation by conducting or coordinating scientific studies
  of fish stocks and other living marine resources and establishing common management
  measures to be implemented by member governments based on their results.  Many also
  oversee the allocation of member nations' fishing rights.
