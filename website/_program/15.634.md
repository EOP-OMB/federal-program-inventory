objective: The primary purpose of the the Competitive State Wildlife Grant (C-SWG)
  Program is to help State and Territory fish and wildlife agencies design and implement
  strategic, proactive conservation programs. C-SWG Program funds, pooled with recipient
  matching resources, enable these agencies to identify, study, and conserve species
  deemed most in need of conservation within each State and Territory. Proactive approaches
  to species conservation help agency grant recipients, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
  Service, and our conservation partners avoid more prescriptive Federal regulatory
  requirements associated with listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). A core
  principle of the C-SWG Program is the utilization of effective partnerships demonstrating
  cooperation and leveraging of resources to achieve shared conservation goals.
