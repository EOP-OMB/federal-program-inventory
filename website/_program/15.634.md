objective: The primary purpose of the State Wildlife Grant (SWG) Program is to help
  State, Territory, and District of Columbia fish and wildlife agencies design and
  implement strategic, proactive conservation programs. Formula SWG Program funds,
  pooled with recipient matching resources, enable these recipients to identify, study,
  and conserve species deemed most in need of conservation. Competitive SWG Program
  funds and matching resources typically support large-scale conservation projects
  involving many partners. Proactive approaches to species conservation help grant
  recipients, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and other conservation partners
  avoid more prescriptive Federal regulatory requirements associated with listing
  under the Endangered Species Act. A core principle of the SWG Program is the utilization
  of effective partnerships demonstrating cooperation and leveraging of resources
  to achieve shared conservation goals benefiting recipient-identified species of
  greatest conservation need.

- description: The discretionary (competitive) subprogram anticipates receiving 25
    applications and issuing 12 to 18 awards. The number of applications for mandatory
    grants varies annually based on State priorities and capacity. SWG Program funds
    are positively impacting many Endangered Species Act listing decisions. The Program
    has likely helped to curtail growth of State and Federal expenditures on federally
    listed species since the Program was first created in 2001. The SWG Program was
    a key funding source for the conservation and recovery of more than 50 percent
    of threatened and endangered species that were de-listed by the Service for conservation-related
    reasons through 2015. The SWG Program has also helped States contribute to Service
    removal or withdrawal of a significant portion of Candidate species listingsâ€”those
    species found by the Service to be warranted for listing but not yet listed. The
    Service awarded 309 grants under the Formula (mandatory) subprogram in 2017. The
    number of applications for Formula grants varies annually based on State priorities
    and capacity. The discretionary (competitive) subprogram received 20 applications
    and issued 16 awards in 2017.
