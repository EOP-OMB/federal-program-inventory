objective: Education Program Enhancements provide resources for special studies, projects,
  new activities, and other costs associated with enhancing the basic educational
  programs provided to students.  These funds allow BIE to provide specialized assistance
  to schools struggling to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) that is targeted to
  address the schoolsâ€™ unique needs and specific gaps in achievement.  Typically,
  assistance involves implementation of specialized programs in reading and math,
  and staff development for principals, teachers and support staff.
