  \ to enhance educational equity for underrepresented students;  \r\n\r\n(2)  strengthen\
  \ institutional educational capacities including libraries, curriculum, faculty,\
  \ scientific instrumentation, instruction delivery systems, and student recruitment\
  \ and retention, in order to respond to identified State, regional, national, or\
  \ international educational needs in the food and agricultural sciences; \r\n\r\n\
  (3)  attract and support undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented\
  \ groups in order to prepare them for careers related to the food, agricultural,\
  \ and natural resource systems of the United States, beginning with the mentoring\
  \ of students at the high school level and continuing with the provision of financial\
  \ support for students through their attainment of a doctoral degree; and \r\n\r\
  \n(4) facilitate cooperative initiatives between two or more Hispanic-Serving Institutions,\
  \ or between Hispanic-Serving Institutions and units of State government or the\
  \ private sector, to maximize the development and use of resources, such as faculty,\
  \ facilities, and equipment, to improve food and agricultural sciences teaching\
  \ programs."
