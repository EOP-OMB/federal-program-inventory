objective: "The purpose of this grant program is to increase drinking water system\
  \ resilience to natural hazards. Grant funding can be used to assist in the planning,\
  \ design, construction, implementation, operation, or maintenance of a program or\
  \ project that increases resilience to natural hazards.\n\nFunding Priority \u2013\
  \ Fiscal Year 2023:  Funding priority is for projects that increase drinking water\
  \ system resilience to natural hazards in underserved communities that are disadvantaged\
  \ communities or communities with a population of less than 10,000 individuals.\
  \ Underserved communities include those communities that: do not have household\
  \ drinking water or wastewater services; are served by a public water system that\
  \ violates,  or exceeds a requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation\
  \ issued under SDWA section 1412, including a maximum contaminant level, a treatment\
  \ technique, or an action level. Eligible activities for funding include planning,\
  \ design, construction, implementation, operation, or maintenance of a program or\
  \ project that increases drinking water resilience to natural hazards through :\
  \ (A) the conservation of water or the enhancement of water use efficiency; (B)\
  \ the modification or relocation of existing drinking water system infrastructure\
  \ made, or that is at risk of being, significantly impaired by natural hazards,\
  \ including risks to drinking water from flooding; (C) the design or construction\
  \ of desalination facilities to serve existing communities; (D) watershed management\
  \ and source water protection; (E) the enhancement of energy efficiency or the use\
  \ and generation of renewable energy in the conveyance or treatment of drinking\
  \ water; or (F) the development and implementation of measures to increase the resilience\
  \ of the eligible entity to natural hazards."
