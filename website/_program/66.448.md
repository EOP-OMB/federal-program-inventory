objective: 'The purpose of this grant program is to increase drinking water system
  resilience to natural hazards. Grant funding can be used to assist in the planning,
  design, construction, implementation, operation, or maintenance of a program or
  project that increases resilience to natural hazards.  Funding is for projects that
  increase drinking water system resilience to natural hazards in underserved communities
  that are disadvantaged communities or communities with a population of less than
  10,000 individuals. Underserved communities include those communities that: do not
  have household drinking water or wastewater services; are served by a public water
  system that violates, or exceeds a requirement of a national primary drinking water
  regulation issued under SDWA section 1412, including a maximum contaminant level,
  a treatment technique, or an action level.'
