objective: Provides technical and financial assistance to State of New Mexico Environment
  Department and the Regents of New Mexico State University/Carlsbad Environmental
  Monitoring and Research Center (NMSU/CEMRC) for the conduct of projects/activities
  to support DOE's and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) mission and to provide
  the public assurances that implemented DOE programs are protective of human health
  and the environment. The purpose of the WIPP Environmental Monitoring Project is
  to establish and maintain independent environmental research and monitoring in the
  vicinity of the WIPP and to make the results easily accessible to all interested
  parties. This project began implementation during the WIPP pre-disposal phase, and
  is continuing during the operational (disposal) phase. The environmental monitoring
  projects are organized and carried out independent of direct oversight by Department
  Of Energy (DOE). Analytical results and interpretations from the monitoring are
  published by NMSU/CEMRC to inform the public and particularly the environmental
  science community.  The State of New Mexico holds the permit for disposal of Resource
  Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) waste at WIPP and the independent monitoring
  provides assurance to the State that WIPP is operating in accordance with its RCRA
  Permit.
