- description: "PHMSA\u2019s research supports regulatory and enforcement activities\
    \ and provides the technical and analytical foundation necessary for planning,\
    \ evaluating, and implementing the pipeline safety program. PHMSA annually sponsors\
    \ R&D projects that focus on providing near-term solutions to help ensure the\
    \ safe, reliable, and environmentally-sound operation of the Nation's pipeline\
    \ system.\n\n\nRecent R&D projects have focused on the following areas: leak detection;\
    \ detection of mechanical damage; damage prevention; improved pipeline system\
    \ controls, monitoring, operations, improvements in pipeline materials, underground\
    \ natural gas storage (UNGS) and liquid natural gas (LNG). These projects develop\
    \ innovative technology, strengthen consensus standards, and promote knowledge\
    \ to decision makers that can be implemented to improve pipeline system safety.\
    \ \n\n\nPHMSA maintains a collaborative process in the program by holding annual\
    \ peer reviews on all post-award or active research projects. This action ensures\
    \ that quality is addressed throughout the lifecycle of research (pre-solicitation,\
    \ pre-award, and post-award). These projects must stay true to the goals conceived\
    \ in consensus at R&D Forums and as promised by researchers receiving the government\
    \ research award. If projects deviate, feedback from peer review panels is used\
    \ to adjust or modify them."
