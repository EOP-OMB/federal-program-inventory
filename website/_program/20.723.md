- description: TBD Program made three new awards addressing the further development
    of robotic inspection solutions capable of inspecting natural gas pipelines that
    are not piggable by traditional technology. The program also entered into two
    cooperative agreements.  One with the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement
    where a project developing inspection criteria for offshore risers was co-funded
    and one with the National Institute of Standards and Technology that is investigating
    the characterization of modern high toughness steels for fracture propagation
    and arrest assessment.  All projects have a public page for more information and
    are sortable by FY via https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/matrix/ .
  year: '2016'
- description: PHMSA and the pipeline industry recognize the role of research in removing
    mutual challenges and, since 2002, have coordinated and collaborated on more than
    270 projects and invested approximately $109M of PHMSA funding, plus $100M worth
    of shared resources.
  year: '2017'
- description: Funded a number of projects in the areas of Anomaly Detection/Characterization,
    Leak Detection, Liquefied Natural Gas, Threat Prevention, Underground Natural
    Gas Storage.

- description: "PHMSA’s research supports regulatory and enforcement activities and\
    \ provides the technical and analytical foundation necessary for planning, evaluating,\
    \ and implementing the pipeline safety program. PHMSA annually sponsors R&D projects\
    \ that focus on providing near-term solutions to help ensure the safe, reliable,\
    \ and environmentally-sound operation of the Nation's pipeline system.\n\n\nRecent\
    \ R&D projects have focused on the following areas: leak detection; detection\
    \ of mechanical damage; damage prevention; improved pipeline system controls,\
    \ monitoring, operations, improvements in pipeline materials, underground natural\
    \ gas storage (UNGS) and liquid natural gas (LNG). These projects develop innovative\
    \ technology, strengthen consensus standards, and promote knowledge to decision\
    \ makers that can be implemented to improve pipeline system safety. \n\n\nPHMSA\
    \ maintains a collaborative process in the program by holding annual peer reviews\
    \ on all post-award or active research projects. This action ensures that quality\
    \ is addressed throughout the lifecycle of research (pre-solicitation, pre-award,\
    \ and post-award). These projects must stay true to the goals conceived in consensus\
    \ at R&D Forums and as promised by researchers receiving the government research\
    \ award. If projects deviate, feedback from peer review panels is used to adjust\
    \ or modify them."
