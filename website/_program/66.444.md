objective: 'Funding is awarded to states, territories, and tribes to assist local
  educational agencies in voluntary testing and remediation of lead in drinking water
  at schools and child care facilities. The principal objective of the assistance
  to be awarded under this program is to test and remediate lead in drinking water
  at schools and child care facilities, using EPA’s 3Ts for Reducing Lead in Drinking
  Water guidance or the at least equivalent applicable state regulations or guidance
  regarding reducing lead in drinking water in schools and child care facilities (see:
  https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/3ts-reducing-lead-drinking-water-schools-and-child-care-facilities).
  EPA''s 3Ts, Training, Testing, and Taking Action, provide tools for schools, child
  care facilities, states, and water systems to implement voluntary lead testing and
  remediation programs in drinking water. Funding supports: (1) reducing children’s
  exposure to lead in drinking water; (2) helping states and territories target funding
  toward schools unable to pay for testing; (3) using the 3Ts model, or at least equivalent
  model, to establish best practices for lead in drinking water prevention programs;
  (4) fostering sustainable partnerships at the state and local level to allow for
  more efficient use of existing resources and exchange of information among experts
  in various educational and health sectors; and (5) enhancing community, parent,
  and teacher cooperation and trust.


  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: The priority will be to continue awarding funds
  to reduce lead in drinking water in schools and child care facilities through planning,
  public education, testing and outreach. This voluntary effort focuses on lead reduction
  in drinking water at schools and child care programs that are in disadvantaged and
  low-income areas. The grant program requires EPA’s 3Ts for Reducing Lead in Drinking
  Water in Schools guidance to develop and implement programs in schools and child
  care facilities, and to identify and correct sources of lead in drinking water.


  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2024: The priority will be to award funds to test
  and remediate lead in drinking water in schools and child care facilities through
  planning, public education, testing and outreach, along with taking actions to remediate
  lead from the facilities'' infrastructure. This voluntary effort focuses on lead
  reduction and decreasing the number of lead sources in drinking water at schools
  and child care programs that are in disadvantaged and low-income areas. The grant
  program requires EPA’s 3Ts for Reducing Lead in Drinking Water in Schools guidance
  to develop and implement programs in schools and child care facilities, and to identify
  and remediate the sources of lead in drinking water.'
