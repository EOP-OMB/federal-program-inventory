objective: "Funding is awarded to states, territories, and tribes to assist local\
  \ educational agencies in voluntary testing and remediation of lead in drinking\
  \ water at schools and child care facilities. The principal objective of the assistance\
  \ to be awarded under this program is to test and remediate lead in drinking water\
  \ at schools and child care facilities, using EPA\u2019s 3Ts for Reducing Lead in\
  \ Drinking Water guidance or the at least equivalent applicable state regulations\
  \ or guidance regarding reducing lead in drinking water in schools and child care\
  \ facilities (see: https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/3ts-reducing-lead-drinking-water-schools-and-child-care-facilities).\
  \ EPA's 3Ts, Training, Testing, and Taking Action, provide tools for schools, child\
  \ care facilities, states, and water systems to implement voluntary lead testing\
  \ and remediation programs in drinking water. Funding supports: (1) reducing children\u2019\
  s exposure to lead in drinking water; (2) helping states and territories target\
  \ funding toward schools unable to pay for testing; (3) using the 3Ts model, or\
  \ at least equivalent model, to establish best practices for lead in drinking water\
  \ prevention programs; (4) fostering sustainable partnerships at the state and local\
  \ level to allow for more efficient use of existing resources and exchange of information\
  \ among experts in various educational and health sectors; and (5) enhancing community,\
  \ parent, and teacher cooperation and trust.\n\nFunding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:\
  \ The priority will be to continue awarding funds to reduce lead in drinking water\
  \ in schools and child care facilities through planning, public education, testing\
  \ and outreach. This voluntary effort focuses on lead reduction in drinking water\
  \ at schools and child care programs that are in disadvantaged and low-income areas.\
  \ The grant program requires EPA\u2019s 3Ts for Reducing Lead in Drinking Water\
  \ in Schools guidance to develop and implement programs in schools and child care\
  \ facilities, and to identify and correct sources of lead in drinking water.\n\n\
  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2024: The priority will be to award funds to test\
  \ and remediate lead in drinking water in schools and child care facilities through\
  \ planning, public education, testing and outreach, along with taking actions to\
  \ remediate lead from the facilities' infrastructure. This voluntary effort focuses\
  \ on lead reduction and decreasing the number of lead sources in drinking water\
  \ at schools and child care programs that are in disadvantaged and low-income areas.\
  \ The grant program requires EPA\u2019s 3Ts for Reducing Lead in Drinking Water\
  \ in Schools guidance to develop and implement programs in schools and child care\
  \ facilities, and to identify and remediate the sources of lead in drinking water."
