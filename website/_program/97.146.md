objective: "The mission and goal  of the CTG ASSURE program is to enable communities\
  \ to address specific evolving and emerging threats and hazards and close capability\
  \ gaps through development and delivery of learning solutions that strengthen the\
  \ nation’s preparedness. The CTG ASSURE program identifies to identify, develops,\
  \ tests and delivers training to the SLTT emergency management and emergency response\
  \ workforce, and provides on-site and mobile training at the performance and management\
  \ and planning levels. The objectives of the CTG ASSURE program are:\n\n•\tIdentify,\
  \ develop, test, and deliver on-site mobile and web-based training at the awareness,\
  \ performance, planning and management levels to the SLTT emergency management and\
  \ emergency response workforce.\n•\tSupport FEMA strategic priorities to instill\
  \ equity as a foundation of emergency management and lead whole of community climate\
  \ resilience; and \n•\tAnalyze and address current and emerging capability gaps\
  \ and risks identified in the 2023 National Preparedness Report.  \nFEMA is committed\
  \ to reducing complexity, increasing efficiency, and improving outcomes. In simple\
  \ terms, the training return on investment (ROI) is expressed as the benefit to\
  \ cost ratio for individuals, teams, departments, jurisdictions and regions across\
  \ the nation to reach and maintain fully qualified/mission capable status. In practice,\
  \ training ROI is difficult to measure. The cost of training varies significantly\
  \ depending upon several variables including delivery format (i.e., online, indirect/train-the-trainer,\
  \ mobile, resident/on-campus) and competency level (i.e., awareness, performance/operations,\
  \ management). FEMA uses a systematic approach to optimize the national preparedness\
  \ training portfolio, align resources to address capability gaps through the most\
  \ effective and efficient means available, and ensure a sound ROI from the local\
  \ to the national level. Collaboration with FEMA’s training partners is integral\
  \ to that effort."
