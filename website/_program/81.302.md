objective: 'The goal of the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) program is to create
  nuclear weapons relevant conditions in the laboratory without the need to return
  to underground nuclear testing. The objectives of this assistance listing are: (1)
  To support the U.S. scientific community in ICF and High Energy Density (HED) science
  through university involvement in areas of fundamental science and technology relevant
  to stockpile stewardship; (2) to promote and sustain scientific interactions between
  the academic community and scientists at the NNSA laboratories; (3) to train scientists
  in specific areas of long-term research relevant to stockpile stewardship; (4) to
  support and enable access to university-based ICF research facilities, and increase
  the availability of unique experimental facilities sited at NNSA''s laboratories
  to the academic community, particularly for collaborations in areas of relevance
  to stockpile stewardship; and (5) to develop and maintain a long-term recruiting
  pipeline to NNSA''s laboratories by increasing the visibility of NNSA''s ICF programâ€™s
  scientific activities to the U.S. faculty and student communities.'
