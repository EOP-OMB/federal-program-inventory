objective: 'The objectives of the State Tribal Education Partnership (STEP) program
  (CFDA 84.415A) are to (a) promote Tribal self-determination in education; (b) improve
  the academic achievement of Indian children and youth; and (c) promote the coordination
  and collaboration of Tribal educational agencies (TEAs) with State educational agencies
  (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) to meet the unique educational and
  culturally related academic needs of Indian students.


  The objectives of the Native American Language (NAL) program (CFDA 84.415B) are
  to (a) to establish a grant program to support schools that use Native American
  and Alaska Native languages as the primary language of instruction; (b) to maintain,
  protect, and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans and Alaska Natives
  to use, practice, maintain, and revitalize their languages, as envisioned in the
  Native American Languages Act (25 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.); and (c) to support the Nation’s
  First Peoples’ efforts to maintain and revitalize their languages and cultures,
  and to improve educational opportunities and student outcomes within Native American
  and Alaska Native communities.


  National Activities funds also support, through contracts, the National Indian Education
  Study, technical assistance to grantees, peer review of new grant awards, and logistical
  support activities, including tribal consultations and listening sessions.  The
  objective of the Native American Language Resource Centers program (CFDA 84.415C)
  is to support establishing, strengthening, and operating one or more Native American
  language resource centers.'
