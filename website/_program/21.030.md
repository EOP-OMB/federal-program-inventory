objective: Under the ECIP, Treasury will invest $8,570,109,000 in capital directly
  to credit unions, insured depository institutions, and bank or savings and loan
  holding companies that are certified Community Development Financial Institutions
  (CDFIs) or minority depository institutions (MDIs) to, among other things, provide
  loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses,
  and consumers, especially in low-income and underserved communities that may be
  disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
  ECIP is not a grant program. The ECIP is a direct investment program comprising
  the purchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt instruments from eligible financial
  institutions.
