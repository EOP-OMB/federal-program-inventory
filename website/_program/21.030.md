objective: Under the ECIP, Treasury invested $8,570,109,000 in capital directly in
  175 credit unions, insured depository institutions, and bank or savings and loan
  holding companies that are certified Community Development Financial Institutions
  (CDFIs) or minority depository institutions (MDIs) to, among other things, provide
  loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses,
  and consumers, especially in low-income and underserved communities that may have
  been disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  The ECIP is not a grant program. The ECIP is a direct investment program comprising
  the purchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt instruments from eligible financial
  institutions.  No new awards are being made but existing projects are still active.

- description: Data from the first 18 months of the implementation of the program
    demonstrate that community financial institutions participating in ECIP were well-positioned
    to deliver loans and other resources, at scale, to financially underserved communities
    that were particularly impacted by the pandemic. In approximately 18 months, ECIP
    participants originated a total of $58.3 billion in loans, of which more than
    one third was to the most underserved borrowers. Approximately three quarters,
    or $43.0 billion, of these originations was qualified lending to targeted communities.
    More than one third of these total originations, or $20.6 billion, was deep impact
    lending to the most underserved borrowers. For more information, please see https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ECIP-2023-Report-Final-07.12.24.pdf.
