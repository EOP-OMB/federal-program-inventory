objective: On September 19, 2011, the Government of the United States of America and
  the World Health Organization (WHO) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to
  help WHO Member States strengthen their capabilities to support the International
  Health Regulations (IHR), an international agreement that requires Member States
  to prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross
  borders. The MOU includes specific statements that authorize WHO and its regional
  offices to pursue activities that improve the ability of all nations to detect,
  report, and respond to infectious diseases quickly and accurately.  The purpose
  is to assist WHO in implementing the MOU regarding the International Health Regulations,
  including the development and implementation of coordinated plans and networks that
  enable national governments and regional authorities globally to better address
  infectious diseases, particularly emerging infections.  Specific activities will
  focus on improving infectious disease surveillance and response; enhancing knowledge
  generation, innovation, and tools for improved management that build public health
  infrastructure and strengthen regional health leadership and collaboration; sharing
  knowledge, tools and other resources in support of applied epidemiology; and developing
  improved infectious disease surveillance, prevention and control strategies.
