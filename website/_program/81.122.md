objective: Through research, development, demonstration, technology transfer, and
  education and outreach activities, lead national efforts to modernize the electric
  grid; enhance security and reliability of the energy infrastructure; and mitigate
  the impact of, and facilitate recovery from, disruptions to the energy supply.  Develop
  cost-effective technology that enhances the reliability, efficiency, and resiliency
  of the electric grid, while enabling the effective utilization of emerging and renewable
  generation sources and promoting the rapid deployment and integration of advanced
  digital "Smart Grid" technology that is needed to modernize the nationâ€™s electric
  delivery network for enhanced operational intelligence and connectivity.  Also,
  leverage scientific research in mathematics for application to power system models
  and software tools to foster strategic, power systems research capabilities.
