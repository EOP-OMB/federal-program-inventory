objective: "The Office of Electricity (OE) leads the Department’s research, development,\
  \ and demonstration (RD&D) programs to strengthen and modernize our Nation’s power\
  \ grid. OE programs support activities, primarily through competitive solicitations,\
  \ with key objectives:\n\n•\tRD&D system monitoring and diagnostics, advanced data\
  \ analytics, and robust control technologies and enhance the reliability and performance\
  \ of the electricity system, mitigate large-scale blackouts, prepare for, and respond\
  \ to the impacts of natural disasters, and adapt to evolving system needs, emerging\
  \ risks, and interdependencies.\n•\tCharacterize risk and uncertainty across multiple\
  \ utility and infrastructure boundaries for increased resiliency.\n•\tRD&D of technologies,\
  \ tools, and techniques required by the distribution grid to maintain and improve\
  \ reliability and resilience.\n•\tDevelop solutions to strengthen information security\
  \ and resilience of the electricity delivery system against cyber-related threats.\n\
  •\tAccelerate bi-directional electrical energy storage technologies as a key component\
  \ of a reliable, resilient, and affordable future-ready grid.\n•\tEnhance and advance\
  \ the components and technologies that make up the electric power T&D infrastructure\
  \ (i.e., grid hardware).\n•\tRapidly assess new grid systems and subsystems by testing\
  \ integrated technology suites in controlled pilot environments prior to the hardware\
  \ and software being deployed by industry in operational environments."
