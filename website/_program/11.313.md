objective: The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms (TAAF) program helps economically
  distressed U.S. businesses in building strategies to increase exports and thereby
  create jobs. The program provides technical assistance to U.S. businesses that have
  lost sales and employment due to increased imports of similar goods and services.
  Technical assistance is provided through a nationwide network of eleven Economic
  Development Administration (EDA) funded Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers (TAACs).
