objective: 'The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Forest and Woodland Resource Management
  Program manages and conserves 58 million acres of forest and woodland in 12 western
  States and Alaska. These forests provide a range of ecosystem services including
  wildlife habitat, hydrologic function, and sustainable harvest of forest products
  valued by society. A primary activity of the program is to maintain and improve
  the resilience of forest and woodland ecosystems to wildfire, insects, disease,
  and drought through density management using timber sales and Stewardship agreements.
  The goals of the program are to: implement science-based forest restoration projects
  to improve forest health and resilience to wildfires, insects, disease, and drought.
  Sustainable harvest of forests and woodlands to produce a continuous supply of wood
  products and biomass for renewable energy. Salvage dead and dying timber to reduce
  fuels, in balance with the need for wildlife habitat, watershed function, and soil
  stability, while supporting local economies. Provide the public with commercial
  and personal use opportunities to harvest products such as firewood, Christmas trees,
  boughs, greenery, medicinal plants, fence posts, and pinyon pine nuts from forests
  and woodlands. Removal of beetle-killed timber to reduce the risk of catastrophic
  fire and minimize risks to the recreating public. This program supports the Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Public Law 117-58, Section 40804(b) Ecosystem Restoration
  and Section 40803 Wildfire Risk Reduction.'
