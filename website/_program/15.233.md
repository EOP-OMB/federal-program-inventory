objective: 'The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Forest and Woodland Resource Management
  Program manages and conserves 58 million acres of forest and woodland in 12 western
  States and Alaska. These forests provide a range of ecosystem services including
  wildlife habitat, hydrologic function, and sustainable harvest of forest products
  valued by society. A primary activity of the program is to maintain and improve
  the resilience of forest and woodland ecosystems to wildfire, insects, disease,
  and drought through density management using timber sales and Stewardship agreements.
  The goals of the program are to: implement science-based forest restoration projects
  to improve forest health and resilience to wildfires, insects, disease, and drought.
  Sustainable harvest of forests and woodlands to produce a continuous supply of wood
  products and biomass for renewable energy. Salvage dead and dying timber to reduce
  fuels, in balance with the need for wildlife habitat, watershed function, and soil
  stability, while supporting local economies. Provide the public with commercial
  and personal use opportunities to harvest products such as firewood, Christmas trees,
  boughs, greenery, medicinal plants, fence posts, and pinyon pine nuts from forests
  and woodlands. Removal of beetle-killed timber to reduce the risk of catastrophic
  fire and minimize risks to the recreating public. This program supports the Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Public Law 117-58, Section 40804(b) Ecosystem Restoration
  and Section 40803 Wildfire Risk Reduction.'

- description: No current data available. BLM continues to maintain and expand partnerships
    to include funding for continued support of collaborative efforts to build community
    capacity and support for ecological restoration efforts in forests and woodland
    areas. Both the public and Government agencies benefit from the BLM's support
    of partners from heightened understanding of the social, economic, as well as
    environmental, aspects of ecosystem restoration and maintenance.  The BLM awarded
    stewardship cooperative agreements to the Mule Deer Foundation, American Forests,
    Society of American Foresters, universities, and several resource conservation
    districts to improve wildlife habitat, reduce hazardous fuels, promote reforestation
    and restore resilience to forest and woodlands.

- description: Continued to use agreements including Good Neighbor to implement restoration
    and fuels reduction treatments across forest and woodlands. Projects  included
    forest thinning to improve resilience to wildfire, insect, and disease, hazardous
    fuels reduction treatments, chemical treatment of invasive weeds, and vegetation
    treatment to improve wildlife habitat.

- description: Projects to protect and restore whitebark pine. Treatment included
    thinning competing tree species around whitebark pine (daylighting) to promote
    fire resilience and tree vigor. Whitebark pine stands were also protected using
    verbenone to repel insect attack. Project partner  training workshops on aspen
    restoration, protection, and management.

    efforts toward reforestation of lands impacted by high severity wildfire and insect
    epidemics. Part of this effort will entail identifying BLM lands where there has
    been a loss of forest and woodland cover.
