objective: 'The goal of this program is to conduct balanced research and development
  efforts in the following energy technologies: solar, biomass, hydrogen and fuel
  cells, wind, hydropower, and geothermal. Grants and cooperative agreements will
  be offered to develop and transfer to the nonfederal sector various renewable energy
  technologies on a competitive basis. Submission deadlines will be published in specific
  Notices of Funding Opportunities on EERE Exchange at https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/.
  Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) are also posted at the grants.gov website
  at http://www.grants.gov.'

- description: 'While vehicles with more efficient and sophisticated engines are hitting
    the road in ever-greater numbers, their performance is limited by the properties
    of today’s conventional fuels. Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy
    Co-Optimization of Fuels & Engines (Co-Optima) initiative are exploring how simultaneous
    innovations in fuels and engines can boost fuel economy and vehicle performance,
    while reducing emissions—advancing the underlying science needed to deliver better
    fuels and better engines sooner.


    The Co-Optima team views fuels not as standalone elements in the transportation
    system, but as dynamic design variables that can work with modern engines to optimize
    and revolutionize the entire on-road fleet, from light-duty passenger cars to
    heavy-duty freight trucks. Top scientists, engineers, and analysts from national
    laboratories, universities, and industry are collaborating on this first-of-its-kind
    effort to combine biofuels and combustion research and development.


    Building on decades of advances in fuels and engines, the Co-Optima initiative’s
    three-pronged, integrated approach is providing American industry with the scientific
    underpinnings needed to identify and develop:


    Engines designed to run more efficiently on affordable, scalable, and sustainable
    fuels

    Fuels designed to enable high-efficiency, low-emission engines

    Strategies that can shape the success of new fuels and vehicle technologies with
    industry and consumers.'
