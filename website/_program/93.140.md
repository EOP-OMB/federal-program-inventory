objective: 'The National Institutes of Health (NIH) IRTA Traineeships/Fellowships
  are established for the principal benefit of the participants and to provide opportunities
  for developmental training and practical research experience in a variety of disciplines
  related to biomedical research, medical library research, and related fields. The
  IRTA components are: 1) Postdoctoral IRTA - designed to provide advanced practical
  research experience to physicians and other doctoral researchers who are at the
  beginning stages of their professional research careers; 2) Predoctoral IRTA - designed
  to provide practical research training and experience to students, by supplementing
  academic course work and/or encouraging pursuit of professional careers in biomedical
  research to students enrolled in doctoral degree programs in biomedical sciences;  3)
  Postbaccalaureate IRTA - designed to provide recent college graduates, particularly
  minorities, women, and persons with disabilities, an opportunity to postpone application
  to graduate or medical school and to provide a means to introduce individuals early
  in their careers to research, encourage their pursuit of professional careers in
  biomedical research, and allow additional time to pursue successful application
  to either graduate or medical school programs; and 4) Student IRTA - designed to
  provide a developmental training experience to promising high school, undergraduate,
  and graduate or professional students who have expressed a strong interest in or
  are studying disciplines related to biomedical sciences.'
