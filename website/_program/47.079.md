objective: To enable the U.S. to maintain its leadership within the global scientific
  community by strengthening international partnerships to advance scientific discovery
  and contribute to the scientific strength and welfare of the Nation; to promote
  research excellence through international collaboration; to develop a diverse, globally
  engaged U.S. science and engineering workforce by providing U.S. students and faculty
  with international research and education experiences. The research supported is
  basic in character. OISE programs includes support of international research and
  education projects that are innovative and catalytic. OISE programs complement and
  enhance the Foundation's research and education portfolio to overcome barriers involved
  in international collaboration. Grants are made in all the disciplinary fields supported
  by NSF. Support is provided for international collaborative research; research workshops
  and planning visits; activities that will develop the next generation of U.S. scientists
  and engineers such as graduate traineeships, postdoctoral fellowships, special opportunities
  for junior faculty for research support, and dissertation enhancements; and for
  U.S. Government support to key multilateral organizations. Support is provided for
  undergraduate student international research and education experiences, and for
  research opportunities for women, minorities, and disabled scientists and engineers.
