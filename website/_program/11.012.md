objective: To support projects aimed at the development and sustainability of a national
  and international integrated ocean observing system designed to collect, monitor
  and disseminate marine environment data in an interoperable, reliable, timely and
  user-specified manner by leveraging federal, regional and private-sector partnerships.

- description: 'IOOS completed a programmatic environmental assessment (PEA) of the
    observing activities regularly occurring in the environment as a direct result
    of cooperative agreements funded by this program. The PEA demonstrates the program’s
    commitment to fully consider the impacts of NOAA’s proposed actions on the quality
    of the human environment.  The PEA resulted in a Finding of No Significant Impact.
    IOOS also successfully completed a competition to fund the regional observing
    systems and sensor evaluation programs.  Eleven cooperative agreements were awarded
    to manage and operate the regional observing systems and one cooperative agreement
    was awarded to manage and operate the national sensor evaluation program.  IOOS
    released The Ocean Enterprise: A study of U.S. business activity in ocean measurement,
    observation and forecasting.  This study is the first national-level assessment
    of private sector activity in this critical component of the blue economy, which
    helps deliver critical safety, economic, and environmental benefits across the
    board, advancing maritime commerce.  Commercial and non-profit activity in this
    sector has not previously been examined as a stand-alone sector as it is scattered
    among numerous economic activities.  By collecting this information into a single
    analysis, NOAA and other entities are better able to see opportunities for partnerships
    and innovation, as well as identifying information gaps. '
  year: '2016'
- description: IOOS, along with its federal partners, intends to fund cooperative
    agreements that continue the development and operation of the regional component
    of U.S. IOOS, a national sensor and evaluation program, a coastal ocean modeling
    testbed, marine biodiversity and animal telemetry networks, ocean technology transition
    and total water efforts.
  year: '2017'
- description: 'IOOS intends to competitively fund projects for the Coastal Ocean
    Modeling Testbed, subject to the availability of funds, which advance new or existing
    solutions that address long standing and emerging coastal modeling, forecast product
    development, and data management challenges. IOOS will seek to fund projects ¬sufficiently
    mature for evaluation and transition to long term operations, focused on models,
    tools or products for which there are demonstrated operators and end users. '
  year: '2018'
- description: National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) awarded three new
