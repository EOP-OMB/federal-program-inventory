objective: This program’s objectives are to promote public awareness of the CyberTipline®,
  formerly known as the National Child Pornography Tip Line. The CyberTipline® is
  a registered trademark of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
  and is a law enforcement priority tool. This funding opportunity is intended to
  support promotional global activities to educate law enforcement, the public, electronic
  service providers (ESPs) and other entities, of the benefits of using the CyberTipline®
  to make reports of abduction, abuse, and sexual exploitation of children and to
  assist law enforcement globally in their investigations and recovery of those children.

- description: It is expected that the number of CyberTipline® reports provided globally
    by the public, ESP’s and companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google regarding
    child exploitation will continue to increase during FY2017 as more people and
    companies become aware of this format to provide information regarding these child
    exploitation crimes. We can’t predict the percent of increase in the reports generated,

  year: '2017'
- description: Through the current time for the Fiscal Year 2018 Grant period, the
    promotion to make the public, ESPs and other entities, along with law enforcement
    throughout the world aware of the CyberTipline and the benefits of making reports
    regarding abduction, abuse and sexual exploitation of children, have provided
    an increase of 5% of the number of reports received through the CyberTipline,
    however, the method of reporting has been streamlined by many to report a suspect
    one time with all of the related reports instead of with each report separately.  This
    causes the amount of reports reviewed to reflect a smaller number/percentage,
    however, this does not mean that reporting has decreased during the current Grant
    period.  There has also been a 25% increase in the number of ESPs enrolled to
    provide reports as compared to the same time period during the previous fiscal
    year Grant period.  The actual increase in CyberTipline reports from the public,
    ESPs and other entities are continuing to facilitate the abilities and actions
    of law enforcement and prosecutors globally, to include the recovery of victims,
    and the capability to continue to be more effective in securing the internet,
    the homeland, the people, and their way of life.

    by the public, ESP’s and companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google regarding
    child exploitation continued to increase during FY2019 as more people and companies
    became aware of this format to provide information regarding these child exploitation
    crimes.  The CyberTipline® reports continue to facilitate the abilities and actions
    of law enforcement and prosecutors and the capability to continue to be more effective
    in securing the internet, the homeland, the people and their way of life.

  year: '2020'
- description: While total reports received within fiscal years can fluctuate and
    are hard to predict, in FY 2021, HSI received a 7% decrease (22,410,22) in the
    number of Cyber Tipline reports, including those reported by the public, private
    sector, and ESPs for further investigation as opposed to the previous year (2020)
    when there was a 58 % increase from 2019.  HSI prioritized the identification
    and rescue of victims and increased the number of offenders prosecuted for the
    sexual exploitation and abuse of children, as well as increased outreach to public
    and private entities to raise awareness of protecting children from being harmed
    online and to provide resources and contact information to report abuse of suspicious
    behavior.

    sextortion and has resulted in an increase in industry reporting of financial
    sextortion of minors.
