objective: "The Community Health Access and Rural Transformation (CHART) Model is\
  \ a voluntary payment Model. CHART will test whether aligned financial incentives\
  \ across payers and robust technical support enable rural providers to transform\
  \ care on a broad scale and increase uptake of Alternative Payment Models (APMs)\
  \ in ways that improve access to high quality care and reduce Medicare and Medicaid\
  \ costs.\n\nCHART will equip recipients with funding and a framework to assess their\
  \ Community\u2019s health needs, create a care delivery and redesign strategy, and\
  \ select an Alternative Payment Model (APM) to offer providers in their area. Communities\u2019\
  \ participation in CHART will begin with a year pre-implementation period, during\
  \ which they will develop a care delivery redesign strategy and recruit participants.\
  \ Following the pre-implementation period, recipients will have 6 performance years\
  \ (PYs).\n\nSIM\nThe State Innovation Model (SIM) is based on the premise that state\
  \ innovation with broad stakeholder input and engagement will align delivery system\
  \ transformation across multiple payers and populations to provide better care at\
  \ lower costs. SIM is focused on public and private sector collaboration to transform\
  \ the state\u2019s delivery system. SIM provides financial and technical support\
  \ to states to test the ability of state governments to use their regulatory and\
  \ policy levers to accelerate health transformation efforts. In Round 1, CMS partnered\
  \ with 6 Model Test states to implement state-wide health transformation strategies\
  \ and 19 Model Design states to develop and refine State Healthcare Innovation Plans\
  \ (SHIPs) to guide future implementation efforts.  In Round 2, CMS partnered with\
  \ an additional 11 Model Test states to implement their SHIPs and 17 states, 3 territories,\
  \ and the District of Columbia to develop and/or refine their SHIPs.  All of the\
  \ Design states from both rounds of SIM have completed their project period 2 of\
  \ the 6 Round 1 Test states have completed their tests and the other 4 are in their\
  \ final year.   The 11 Round 2 Test states are currently in the active testing phase.\
  \  There are no current opportunities for additional rounds of SIM."
