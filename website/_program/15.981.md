objective: To support State water resource agencies in developing water use and availability
  datasets that are integrated with each appropriate dataset developed or maintained
  by the USGS or that integrate any water use or water availability dataset of the
  State water resource agency into each appropriate dataset developed or maintained
  by the USGS. The Water Use Data and Research program will allow State Water Resource
  agencies to improve the collection and reporting frequency of water use categories,
  including the inclusion of categories that have been discontinued in the past due
  to limited resources. Data collection, and improvement efforts, as well as research
  conducted will complement priorities and investigations carried by Federal, State,
  and Local Governments, and by private industry in water availability assessments
  for human and ecological uses.
