objective: To support State water resource agencies in developing water use and availability
  datasets that are integrated with each appropriate dataset developed or maintained
  by the USGS or that integrate any water use or water availability dataset of the
  State water resource agency into each appropriate dataset developed or maintained
  by the USGS. The Water Use Data and Research program will allow State Water Resource
  agencies to improve the collection and reporting frequency of water use categories,
  including the inclusion of categories that have been discontinued in the past due
  to limited resources. Data collection, and improvement efforts, as well as research
  conducted will complement priorities and investigations carried by Federal, State,
  and Local Governments, and by private industry in water availability assessments
  for human and ecological uses.

    receiving 25 applications and issuing 15 awards.  The program also anticipates
    awarding non-competitive awards to three states to complete documentation of current
    water use data and research in their respective state. : In FY17, for the competitive

    The program also awarded a non-competitive awards to one state to complete documentation

- description: 'Example 1: The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection''s
    water use data program currently receives information about water use sources
    through submission of a paper registration form. Paper form submissions are also
    used for termination and revision of registered sources. To improve the quality
    of registration and to encourage registration, the Pennsylvania Department of
    Environmental Protection proposes to convert existing paper forms to online forms
    for electronic submission. Example 2: This project aims to improve the accuracy
    and collection of water measurement data by developing a standardized field tool
    for surface water collection for water masters in Idaho and serving the data to
    the public. The majority of water use in Idaho is for irrigation, and therefore
    water masters will primarily inventory and measure water at diversions used for
    irrigation. However, since some of the water is used for other purposes including
    municipal, recreation and fish propagation, the proposed work could also benefit
    other water use categories. This work will improve the quality and increase the
    number of measurements of water use data collected by increasing efficiency and
    standardization. This project will also create a methodology for using Sentinel
    Imagery Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to determine irrigation status
    using a three-class classification (irrigated, non-irrigated, semi-irrigated).
    Determining irrigated land acres is an essential dataset for determining water
    budget, one of many input parameters used in modelling scenarios that are being
    developed for Idaho aquifers and planning regions. The intent is to develop a
    procedure that is portable between differing geographic agricultural areas.   Example
    3: This project that will improve the quality of water use data collected by creating
    geospatial data for the Public Water Supply use category and refine the methodology
    used in the development of livestock water use data. It will improve the collection
    and compilation of public water system use data by developing an ESRI-based geodatabase
    that contains geospatial data of non-transient PWS locations, their associated
    service areas, and the locations of their supply sources. This will be a critical
    tool for analyzing populations served by the systems. The proposed work will also
    review past assumptions about the location of livestock operations, research available
    current information related to livestock production, and develop methods to better
    correlate livestock production with geospatial information by identifying geospatial
    locations of major individual facilities as well as dispersed livestock. The work
    conducted under this project will not only serve the State''s goal of improving
    livestock water use data development but will also serve the USGS goal of improving
    the data that is transferred to the USGS in the cooperative effort to produce
    the USGS''s Estimated Use of Water in the United States. The proposed work will
    allow WUCB to better characterize the populations served by location, better estimate
    the populations served, provide a necessary step to identifying the water source
    and water type, provide the ability to identify interbasin transfers, and enable
    the identification of public water system use by Hydrologic Unit Code 8. The proposed
    work intends to improve data collection for statewide water use for PWSs and livestock,
    and the work is expected to take up to 24 months.'
