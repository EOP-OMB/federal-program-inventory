objective: Under the baseline tax system, holders (issuers) of debt instruments are
  generally required to report interest earned (paid) in the period it accrues, not
  when received. In addition, the amount of interest accrued is determined by the
  actual price paid, not by the stated principal and interest stipulated in the instrument.
  But under current law, any debt associated with the sale of property worth less
  than $250,000 is exempted from the general interest accounting rules. This general
  $250,000 exception is not a tax expenditure under reference tax law but is under
  normal tax baseline. Current law also includes exceptions for certain property worth
  more than $250,000. These are tax expenditure under reference tax law and normal
  tax baselines. These exceptions include, sales of personal residences worth more
  than $250,000, and sales of farms and small businesses worth between $250,000 and
  $1 million.
