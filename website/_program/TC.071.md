objective: Under the baseline tax system, expenses incurred in earning income would
  be deductible, but such expenses would not be deductible when the income or the
  return on an investment is not taxed. Because imputed rental income is not subject
  to tax, mortgage insurance premiums do not represent expenses incurred in earning
  income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows mortgage insurance premiums to be treated
  as deductible mortgage interest expenses. The provision applies to premiums paid
  in 2021.
