objective: The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides major economic and
  energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers, states and the American
  Indian community. The BOEM oversees the exploration and development of oil, natural
  gas and other minerals and renewable energy alternatives on the Nation’s outer continental
  shelf. BOEM continues to look for better ways to serve the American people and to
  ensure that the Nation receives the best value for its resources now and into the
  future. The program not only supports decisions made within the Department of Interior,
  but also provides coastal States and local governments with the information necessary
  to ensure that all stages of offshore energy and mineral activities are conducted
  in a manner to protect both the human and natural environments. The Outer Continental
  Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) Section 1346 mandates the conduct of environmental and socioeconomic
  studies needed for the assessment and management of environmental impacts on the
  human, marine, and coastal environments which may be affected by oil and gas or
  other mineral development. OCSLA Section 1345 authorizes the use of cooperative
  agreements with affected States to meet the requirements of OCSLA, including sharing
  of information, joint utilization of available expertise, formation of joint monitoring
  arrangements to carry out applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and stipulations
  relevant to outer continental shelf operations both onshore and offshore. The purpose
  of the Environmental Studies Program is to obtain the information needed for the
  assessment and the management of environmental impacts; to predict impacts on marine
  biota; and to monitor the human, marine, and coastal environments to provide time
  series and data trend information.
