objective: IRF programs counter  government or societal constraints on religious freedom,
  particularly for members of religious minority communities, and empower civil society
  and build partnerships between groups. Programs address laws that restrict religious
  freedom; build partnerships and coalitions between government and civil society
  to advance religious freedom; monitor, document, and advocate against religious
  freedom abuses; empower civil society to advocate for policies, laws, or practices
  that promote freedom of religion, belief, or non-belief; and promote societal respect
  for members of religious minority groups including by promoting accurate media information.
