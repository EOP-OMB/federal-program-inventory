objective: "Objectives\nTo have in place a public alert and warning system that provides\
  \ timely and effective warnings using the latest broadcast technology standards,\
  \ especially including areas that are traditionally underserved by broadcast providers.\
  \ Specifically, this NGWSGP grant seeks to:\n•\tEnhance capacity of local broadcast\
  \ stations to receive, broadcast, and redistribute emergency alert messages from\
  \ the Integrated Public Alert & Warning System using IPAWS Specification for Common\
  \ Alerting Protocol (CAP);\n•\tImplement upgrades to the NEXTGEN TV ATSC3 broadcast\
  \ standard;\n•\tEnhance technology infrastructure to ensure local public broadcast\
  \ stations can launch new, enhanced broadcast services, that improve and expand\
  \ the distribution of public alerts and warnings; and\n•\tExpand the delivery and\
  \ distribution of emergency alert messages from IPAWS to fill gaps in alert and\
  \ warning delivery to people in underserved areas.\n\n\nPerformance Measures:\n\
  •\tPercent increase in public television stations that are capable of broadcasting\
  \ Integrated Public Alert and Warning System alerts. \n•\tPercent increase in public\
  \ radio stations that are capable of broadcasting Integrated Public Alert and Warning\
  \ System alerts. \n•\tThe number of broadcast entities that replaced emergency generators\
  \ that were at or near the end of their lifecycle. \n•\tThe number of public broadcasting\
  \ staff members trained in ATSC 3.0 (or related digital broadcast technologies)\
