    \ 10 educational Minority Serving Institutions in New Mexico, developed or enhanced\
    \ over 40 university courses in STEM fields.  These grants are aimed at supporting\
    \ the education and training of a future pit manufacturing workforce for Los Alamos\
    \ National Laboratory. Nearly 600 students across these institutions enrolled\
    \ in these courses. \n•\tThe Materials Data Science for Stockpile Stewardship\
    \ Center of Excellence successfully engages a growing network of collaborators\
    \ at national labs and production facilities, convening teams that include representation\
    \ from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory,\
    \ Sandia National Laboratories, Kansas City National Security Campus, Argonne\
    \ National Laboratory, Y-12, and Pantex along with NNSA representatives. Through\
    \ the Center's charge of supporting the Stockpile Stewardship mission, MDS^3 has\
    \ achieved notable progress in automated analysis of synchrotron beamline X-ray\
    \ diffraction datasets, scattering tomography, XRD/XRT imaging, and data analysis\
    \ related to Laser Powder Bed Additive Manufacturing and Direct Ink Write Printing\
    \ while developing a powerful new approach to supporting the NNSA's digital transformation\
    \ through research focused on data governance and stewardship."
