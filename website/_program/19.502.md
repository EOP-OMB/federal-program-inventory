objective: 'The Middle East Regional Cooperation (MERC) Program funds peer-reviewed,
  collaborative, scientific research projects on development topics between Israel
  and its Arab neighbors across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Objectives
  of the program include: (1) Supporting applied actionable research that generates
  results relevant to regional development; (2) Fostering the implementation of research
  results and innovations to improve quality of life and achieve development impact
  in the MENA region; (3) Building science and technology capacity in developing countries
  in the MENA region; (4) Increasing direct Arab-Israeli cooperation by establishing
  strong working relationships that last beyond the life of the project.'

results:
- description: 'In FY 2023, MERC supported 48 grants (45 grants for multi-year applied
    research projects and 3 grants for scientific workshops) covering a wide range
    of development topics including sustainable agriculture, water resources management,
    public health, renewable energy, and environmental conservation. Each grant included
    teams of scientists from Israel working with counterparts from one or more MENA-region
    countries.


    The number of joint Arab-Israeli events and exchanges, at 84, well exceeded FY22â€™s
    total of 22. This increase in events was a result of the resumption of travel
    following the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in the overall number of active
    awards. Grantees met to plan research activities, share techniques, and train
    students and young scientists.


    In FY 2023, 13 new grants were issued. Additionally, as a result of increased
    outreach efforts and new opportunities for cooperation following the Abraham Accords,
    MERC received many more pre-proposals in FY 2023 as compared to the previous year,
    102 versus 74.


    MERC supported grants that yielded technical outcomes with relevance to climate
    adaptation, sustainable natural resources management, and addressing public and
    environmental health concerns. Examples of technical accomplishments under MERC
    Program supported grants in FY 2023 include: (1) researchers developed a low-cost
    roving device based on a boogie board with a camera, sonar, and remotely-controlled
    propellor system to precisely map shallow seagrasses toward understanding the
    effects of climate change on the marine environment; (2) a project team studying
    the transmission of Leishmaniasis tropica developed a method to identify the species
    of sand fly responsible for patient infection; and (3) a broad regional consortium
    developing protocols for the production of high-quality juvenile gray mullet fish
    successfully reproduced captive mullet broodstock and produced more than 200,000
    juveniles. Under other awards, support for knowledge transfer and institutional
    capacity building strengthened capacity for conducting research in areas such
    as crop genetics, marine conservation, and public health.'
