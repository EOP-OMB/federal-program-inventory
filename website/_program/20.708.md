objective: Grant funds will be made available to municipality or community owned utilities
  (not including for-profit entities) seeking assistance in repairing, rehabilitating,
  or replacing high-risk, actively leaking, or leak-prone natural gas distribution
  infrastructure or portions thereof or acquiring equipment to reduce incidents and
  fatalities and to avoid economic loss. This grant program also strives to create
  good-paying jobs; benefit disadvantaged rural and urban communities with safe provision
  of natural gas; and protect our environment and reduce climate impacts by remediating
  aged and failing natural gas distribution pipelines and distribution pipe prone
  to leakage.
