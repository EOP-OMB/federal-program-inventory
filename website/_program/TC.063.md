objective: Under the baseline tax system, expenses incurred in earning income would
  be deductible. However, such expenses would not be deductible when the income or
  the return on an investment is not taxed. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion
  from a taxpayerâ€™s taxable income for the value of owner-occupied housing services
  and also allows the owner-occupant to deduct property taxes paid on real property.
  In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January
  1, 2026, (1) the deduction for foreign real property taxes paid is disallowed and
  (2) the deduction for taxes paid in any taxable year, which includes the deduction
  for property taxes on real property, is limited to $10,000 ($5,000 in the case of
  a married individual filing a separate return).
