objective: 'As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, American Spaces are cultural
  and information centers around the world that provide free and open access for members
  of local communities to learn more about the United States, develop skills, and
  access a wide range of resources. Funded by the U.S. Department of State and hosted
  at U.S. embassies, consulates, and various local partner institutions, approximately
  600 American Spaces in 140 countries host programs and events that foster learning,
  discussion, and civic engagement around democratic principles. Most American Spaces
  are based on partnerships with local organizations (libraries, universities, binational
  centers, NGOs) that provide facilities and staff, but some are located in U.S. government-owned
  facilities, to include embassies or consulates. The Office of American Spaces in
  Washington, D.C., and its training unit in Vienna, Austria, provide centralized
  oversight, strategic direction, funding, training and programming resources to all
  American Spaces, while U.S. embassies and consulates implement the programming to
  engage foreign audiences in support of U.S. national interests.


  The six core programming areas that take place in American Spaces draw on the breadth
  of what the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs offers: Promotion of U.S.
  higher education, including EducationUSA advising; English language learning and
  teaching; Exchange Alumni engagement; strategic cultural programs that utilize ECA’s
  and other envoys (arts, music, sports, science, and more); professional skills building;
  and accurate information about the United States, such as through connecting audiences
  with expert American speakers. The Director of ECA/A/M leads the American Spaces
  strategy, under the direction of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for ECA Academic
  programs. ECA coordinates with other Department bureaus (R/PPR, regional PD offices,
  GPA, OBO, DS, and DT, among others) as appropriate to ensure that all interests
  are met.'
