objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, American Spaces are cultural\
  \ and information centers around the world that provide free and open access for\
  \ members of local communities to learn more about the United States, develop skills,\
  \ and access a wide range of resources. Funded by the U.S. Department of State and\
  \ hosted at U.S. embassies, consulates, and various local partner institutions,\
  \ approximately 600 American Spaces in 145 countries host programs and events that\
  \ foster learning, discussion, and civic engagement around democratic principles.\
  \ Most American Spaces are based on partnerships with local organizations (libraries,\
  \ universities, binational centers, NGOs) that provide facilities and staff, but\
  \ some are located in U.S. government-owned facilities, to include embassies or\
  \ consulates. The Office of American Spaces in Washington, D.C., and its training\
  \ unit in Vienna, Austria, provide centralized oversight, strategic direction, funding,\
  \ training and programming resources to all American Spaces, while U.S. embassies\
  \ and consulates implement the programming to engage foreign audiences in support\
  \ of U.S. national interests.\n\nThe six core programming areas that take place\
  \ in American Spaces draw on the breadth of what the Bureau of Educational and Cultural\
  \ Affairs offers: Promotion of U.S. higher education, including EducationUSA advising;\
  \ English language learning and teaching; Exchange Alumni engagement; strategic\
  \ cultural programs that utilize ECA\u2019s and other envoys (arts, music, sports,\
  \ science, and more); professional skills building; and accurate information about\
  \ the United States, such as through connecting with expert American speakers. The\
  \ State Department\u2019s Public Diplomacy Strategic Framework calls for the revitalization\
  \ of existing American Spaces and the establishment of new ones. The Director of\
  \ ECA/A/M leads the American Spaces strategy, under the direction of the Deputy\
  \ Assistant Secretary for ECA Academic programs. ECA coordinates with other Department\
  \ bureaus (R/PPR, regional PD offices, GPA, OBO, DS, and IRM, among others) as appropriate\
  \ to ensure that all interests are met."
