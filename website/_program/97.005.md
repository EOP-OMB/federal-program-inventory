objective: "National Domestic Preparedness Consortium: Through the National Domestic\
  \ Preparedness Consortium (NDPC) program, the Department of Homeland Security’s\
  \ (DHS) Homeland Security National Training Program (HSNTP) provides funding to\
  \ eligible applicants to develop and deliver training solutions to address national\
  \ preparedness gaps, map training to the core capabilities, and ensure training\
  \ is available and accessible to a nationwide audience. The NDPC addresses the following\
  \ Presidential Policy Directives through training of State, Local, Tribal and Territorial\
  \ (SLTT) first responders: Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness\
  \ and Presidential Policy Directive 21: Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience.\
  \ The NDPC plays an important role in the National Training and Education System\
  \ (NTES), which is part of the larger National Preparedness System (the System).\
  \ The System is designed to build, sustain, and deliver the core capabilities and\
  \ achieve the desired outcomes identified in the National Preparedness Goal (the\
  \ Goal). The Goal is “a secure and resilient nation with the capabilities required\
  \ across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to,\
  \ and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk.” The System\
  \ provides a consistent and reliable approach to support decision making, resource\
  \ allocation, and measure progress toward these outcomes. \nContinuing Training\
  \ Grants: Through its Continuing Training Grants (CTG) program, the Department of\
  \ Homeland Security’s (DHS) Homeland Security National Training Program (HSNTP)\
  \ plays an important role in the National Preparedness System. The CTG program supports\
  \ building, sustaining, and delivering core capabilities through the development\
  \ and delivery of training to achieve the National Preparedness Goal (the Goal),\
  \ which is “a secure and resilient Nation with the capabilities required across\
  \ the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover\
  \ from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk”. Specifically, the CTG\
  \ program provides funding for eligible, selected applicants to support and target\
  \ training solutions for state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners,\
  \ which supports the objective of the National Preparedness System to facilitate\
  \ an integrated, whole community, risk-informed, capabilities-based approach to\
  \ preparedness. The CTG program’s purpose is to address specific threats and gaps\
  \ through the development and delivery of learning solutions and facilitate a national\
  \ whole community approach to focus on the challenges with the greatest impact on\
  \ the Nation’s preparedness. FEMA, through CTG recipients, focuses on developing\
  \ training to address national priorities while considering the challenges presented\
  \ by  pandemic environments. Critical programs funded through the CTG include: the\
  \ National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium (NCPC) which provides funding to\
  \ the eligible applicant to develop and deliver cybersecurity training solutions\
  \ to address national preparedness gaps and Mississippi State University’s (MSU)\
  \ Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Center of Excellence (COE) Unmanned Aircraft\
  \ Systems (UAS) disaster preparedness and response.  \nOverall, both NDPC and CTG\
  \ programs advance the strategic goals of the DHS Strategic Plan (FY) 2020-2024,\
  \ the 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan, Presidential Policy Directives through development\
  \ and delivery of training for SLTT partners including Presidential Policy Directive\
  \ 8: National Preparedness and Presidential Policy Directive 21: Critical Infrastructure\
  \ Security and Resilience."

    disaster response, incident command, cybersecurity, chemical and biological hazard
    response, radiological response, planning and response to bombings, and response
    to crude by rail incidents.  Additionally, within the CTG program DHS/FEMA is
    planning to award cooperative agreements to develop and deliver training to address
    gaps in cybersecurity, hazardous materials, economic recovery, and rural preparedness.
    In FY 2016 DHS/FEMA awarded cooperative agreements to five NDPC members resulting
