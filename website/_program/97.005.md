objective: "National Domestic Preparedness Consortium: Through the National Domestic\
  \ Preparedness Consortium (NDPC) program, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019\
  s (DHS) Homeland Security National Training Program (HSNTP) provides funding to\
  \ eligible applicants to develop and deliver training solutions to address national\
  \ preparedness gaps, map training to the core capabilities, and ensure training\
  \ is available and accessible to a nationwide audience. The NDPC addresses the following\
  \ Presidential Policy Directives through training of State, Local, Tribal and Territorial\
  \ (SLTT) first responders: Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness\
  \ and Presidential Policy Directive 21: Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience.\
  \ The NDPC plays an important role in the National Training and Education System\
  \ (NTES), which is part of the larger National Preparedness System (the System).\
  \ The System is designed to build, sustain, and deliver the core capabilities and\
  \ achieve the desired outcomes identified in the National Preparedness Goal (the\
  \ Goal). The Goal is \u201Ca secure and resilient nation with the capabilities required\
  \ across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to,\
  \ and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk.\u201D The\
  \ System provides a consistent and reliable approach to support decision making,\
  \ resource allocation, and measure progress toward these outcomes. \nContinuing\
  \ Training Grants: Through its Continuing Training Grants (CTG) program, the Department\
  \ of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Homeland Security National Training Program\
  \ (HSNTP) plays an important role in the National Preparedness System. The CTG program\
  \ supports building, sustaining, and delivering core capabilities through the development\
  \ and delivery of training to achieve the National Preparedness Goal (the Goal),\
  \ which is \u201Ca secure and resilient Nation with the capabilities required across\
  \ the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover\
  \ from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk\u201D. Specifically,\
  \ the CTG program provides funding for eligible, selected applicants to support\
  \ and target training solutions for state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT)\
  \ partners, which supports the objective of the National Preparedness System to\
  \ facilitate an integrated, whole community, risk-informed, capabilities-based approach\
  \ to preparedness. The CTG program\u2019s purpose is to address specific threats\
  \ and gaps through the development and delivery of learning solutions and facilitate\
  \ a national whole community approach to focus on the challenges with the greatest\
  \ impact on the Nation\u2019s preparedness. FEMA, through CTG recipients, focuses\
  \ on developing training to address national priorities while considering the challenges\
  \ presented by  pandemic environments. Critical programs funded through the CTG\
  \ include: the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium (NCPC) which provides\
  \ funding to the eligible applicant to develop and deliver cybersecurity training\
  \ solutions to address national preparedness gaps and Mississippi State University\u2019\
  s (MSU) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Center of Excellence (COE) Unmanned\
  \ Aircraft Systems (UAS) disaster preparedness and response.  \nOverall, both NDPC\
  \ and CTG programs advance the strategic goals of the DHS Strategic Plan (FY) 2020-2024,\
  \ the 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan, Presidential Policy Directives through development\
  \ and delivery of training for SLTT partners including Presidential Policy Directive\
  \ 8: National Preparedness and Presidential Policy Directive 21: Critical Infrastructure\
  \ Security and Resilience."
