objective: 'The VALOR Initiative uses a multifaceted approach to address officer safety
  and wellness needs and gaps. This includes delivering no-cost training, providing
  customized assistance, conducting research, developing and providing resources,
  and establishing partnerships that benefit law enforcement officers and the communities
  they serve. Central to the Initiative’s mission is providing innovative, data driven
  and research-based resources to inspire officers and their agencies to adopt a strong
  culture of safety and wellness to create a safer and healthy environment for all
  and improve community trust to lead to cooperative crime reduction efforts and safer
  communities. Through program activities, the Initiative seeks to:


  1) Increase the knowledge and skills of state, local, and tribal law enforcement
  agencies in officer safety and wellness through cutting-edge, innovative resources,
  training, and technical assistance.


  2) Provide law enforcement officers with skills and tools to promote positive police/community
  relations and increase public trust.


  3) Identify and address current and emerging safety and wellness threats and concerns
  to law enforcement.


  4) Raise awareness of BJA’s officer safety and wellness programs, trainings, and
  resources.


  Performance Measures:  Goals and objectives will be measured through collection
  of data recording the above listed program activities such as: 1) the number of
  trainings and technical assistance events held, law enforcement officers trained,
  law enforcement agencies assisted, and 2) the number of resources developed and
  disseminated.'
