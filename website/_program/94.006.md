objective: "AmeriCorps State and National grants are awarded to eligible organizations\
  \ that identify an unmet need in their community that will be addressed by AmeriCorps\
  \ members that the organization recruits, trains, and manages. An AmeriCorps member\
  \ is an individual who is enrolled in an approved national service position and\
  \ engages in community service. Members may receive a living allowance and other\
  \ benefits while serving. Upon successful completion of their service, members receive\
  \ an education award from the National Service Trust. \n\nAmeriCorps grant funding\
  \ is distributed to Governor-appointed State Commissions and multi-state grantees.\
  \ State Commissions award subgrants to organizations in their states, and the multi-state\
  \ grantees work through operating sites in more than one state. These organizations\
  \ recruit AmeriCorps members to respond to local needs."
