objective: "Grants are awarded to support research, development, monitoring, public\
  \ education, outreach, training, demonstration, and studies relating to the protection\
  \ of public health and the environment from pesticides, and potential risk from\
  \ toxic substances. Through innovative partnerships and collaboration, grants are\
  \ also awarded to  prevent pollution before it begins. This reduces waste, saves\
  \ energy and natural resources, and leaves our homes, schools and workplaces cleaner\
  \ and safer. \n\nFunding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: Office of Pesticide Programs\
  \ (OPP)/Certification, Worker Protection Branch (CWPB) priorities: (a) Engaging\
  \ All Stakeholders; (b) National Farmworker Training Program; (c) National Pesticide\
  \ Information Center (NPIC); (d) Pesticide Educational Resources Collaborative (PERC);\
  \ and (e) Pesticide Safety Education Funds Management Program (PSEP). Office of\
  \ Compliance (OC) priority: Pesticide Inspector Residential Training (PIRT). \n\n\
  The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) will continue to support the Tribal Pesticide\
  \ Program Council (TPPC), the Pesticide Regulatory Education Program (PREP), and\
  \ the Association of American Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO). These cooperative\
  \ agreements assist our states, tribes and territories. \n\nOffice of Pollution\
  \ Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) priorities will continue to support the: (a) National\
  \ Toxics Tribal Council (NTTC) and (b) Organization for Economic Co-operation and\
  \ Development's\u202F(OECD) Environment, Health and Safety Program. The Office of\
  \ Pesticide Programs (OPP) will continue to support the Tribal Pesticide Program\

- description: "In FY23, the Tribal Pesticide Program Council (TPPC) and its workgroups\
    \ engaged with EPA, American Association of Pest Control Officials (AAPCO), State\
    \ FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation Group\u202F(SFIREG), and other partners\
    \ on a variety of pesticide topics including but not limited to agricultural worker\
    \ protection and training, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\u202F(PFAS) in\
    \ pesticide containers, treated seeds, native pollinator protection and habitat\
    \ rehabilitation, and incorporating Indigenous Knowledges (IK) into EPA's pesticide\
    \ risk assessment process. The group has been working to update the Status of\
    \ Pesticides in Indian Country Report and to provide training to its members on\
    \ native bee identification. \n\nPREP: \nColorado State University hosted four\
    \ Pesticide Regulatory Education Program (PREP) courses in 2023. These courses\
    \ focused on training state, tribal and territory pesticide managers in the following\
    \ areas: coregulator training for new managers, implementation of the Worker Protection\
    \ Standard (WPS) to protect agricultural workers, FIFRA compliance and enforcement\
    \ management, and the regulatory implications of emerging pesticide applicator\
    \ and monitoring technology.  \n\nAAPCO/SFIREG: \nThe American Association of\
    \ Pest Control Officials (AAPCO) worked with EPA on both the oversight of the\
    \ Pesticide Regulatory Education Program (PREP), and the issues raised by the\
    \ State FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation Group (SFIREG). Coordination topics\
    \ discussed in 2023 include: bilingual labeling, EPA\u2019s approach to evaluating\
    \ pesticides in relation to the Endangered Species Act, and EPA\u2019s Herbicide\
    \ Strategy.\u202FSFIREG also hosted four national meetings in 2023 to further\
    \ collaborate with EPA. \n\nIn FY23, the NTTC met in person twice (this includes\
    \ an upcoming meeting in August). NTTC has been working closely with ECRAD to\
    \ develop a Tribal Exposures Framework to use in the next 20 risk evaluations.\u202F\
    They have also met with the PESS team a few times to discuss Tribal PESS Factors\
    \ to consider in risk evaluations. The NTTC is also working with ORD on a plan\
    \ to incorporate tribal exposures factors where relevant into the Tribal Exposures\
    \ Factors Handbook."
