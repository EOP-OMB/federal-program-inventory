objective: "EHB-Benchmark Plan Modernization Grant for States with a Federally-facilitated\
  \ Exchange (FFE EHB Mod) will provide a funding source to States on the Federally-facilitated\
  \ Exchanges (FFEs) for activities related to submitting an application to update\
  \ EHB-benchmark plans under 45 CFR 156.111. Health insurance that provides the EHB\
  \ must generally provide benefits that are substantially equal to the benefits provided\
  \ in the relevant stateâ€™s EHB-benchmark plan. Each year, states may make updates\
  \ to the benefits covered in EHB-benchmark plans by submitting an application to\
  \ CMS by the first Wednesday in May of the year that is 2 years before the effective\
  \ date of the new EHB-benchmark plan. \n\nStates with an FFE must use grant funds\
  \ for the planning, implementation, and submission of applications to improve or\
  \ update coverage of, and access to the Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) provided\
  \ in state EHB-benchmark plans. States that decide to update EHB-benchmark plans\
  \ with grant funds should endeavor to submit an application by May 5, 2027 for effectiveness\
  \ in plan year 2029. States that do not submit an application by May, 2027, are\
  \ encouraged to submit an application to update their EHB-benchmark plan after the\
  \ end of the award period, but the grant will not be extended to provide states\
  \ with support. These improvements or updates may include, but are not limited to,\
  \ items and services in the following ten benefit categories: (1) ambulatory patient\
  \ services; (2) emergency services; (3) hospitalization; (4) maternity and newborn\
  \ care; (5) mental health and substance use disorder services including behavioral\
  \ health treatment; (6) prescription drugs; (7) rehabilitative and habilitative\
  \ services and devices; (8) laboratory services; (9) preventive and wellness services\
  \ and chronic disease management; and (10) pediatric services, including oral and\
  \ vision care."
