objective: To encourage State Agencies on Aging and Area Agencies on Aging to concentrate
  resources to develop and implement comprehensive and coordinated community-based
  systems of service for older individuals via Statewide planning, and area planning
  and provision of supportive services, including multipurpose senior centers. The
  objective of these services and centers is to maximize the informal support provided
  to older Americans to enable them to remain in their homes and communities. Providing
  transportation services, in-home services, and other support services, this program
  insures that elders receive the services they need to remain independent.
