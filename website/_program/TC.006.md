objective: Under the baseline tax system, taxpayer earnings are subject to tax using
  the regular tax rates applied to all taxpayers. In contrast, IC-DISCs allow a portion
  of income from exports to be taxed at the qualified dividend rate which is no higher
  than 20 percent (plus a 3.8 percent surtax for high-income taxpayers).
