objective: 'To investigate solutions to problems directly relevant to individuals
  with deafness or disorders of human communication in the areas of hearing, balance,
  smell, taste, voice, speech, and language. The National Institute on Deafness and
  Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) supports research and research training, including
  investigation into the etiology, pathology, detection, treatment, and prevention
  of disorders of hearing and other communication processes, primarily through the
  support of basic and applied research in anatomy, audiology, biochemistry, bioengineering,
  epidemiology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, the neurosciences,
  otolaryngology, psychology, pharmacology, physiology, psychophysics, speech-language
  pathology, and other scientific disciplines. The NIDCD supports: (1) Research into
  the evaluation of techniques and devices used in diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation,
  and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes; (2) research
  into prevention and early detection and diagnosis of hearing loss and speech, voice,
  and language disorders and research into preventing the effects of such disorders
  by means of  appropriate referral and rehabilitation; (3) research into the detection,
  treatment, and prevention of disorders of hearing and other communication processes
  in the elderly population and its rehabilitation to ensure continued effective communication
  skills; and (4) research to expand knowledge of the effects of environmental agents
  that influence hearing or other communication processes.  Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) program: To increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; to encourage small business participation
  in Federal research and development; and to foster participation of socially and
  economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small business
  concerns in technological innovation. Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
  program: To stimulate and foster scientific and technological innovation through
  cooperative research and development carried out between small business concerns
  and research institutions; to foster technology transfer between small business
  concerns and research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization
  of innovations derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and
  encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business
  concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological innovation.'
