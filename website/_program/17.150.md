objective: The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) is responsible for
  the administration and enforcement of the civil and criminal provisions of Title
  I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) as well as related
  provisions of other Federal laws (e.g., Title 18 USC federal criminal statutes).
  EBSA is also responsible for assuring compliance with the fiduciary responsibility
  provisions of the Thrift Savings Plan under the Federal Employees' Retirement System
  Act of 1986 (FERSA). The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) is committed
  to educating and assisting more than 152 million workers, retirees and their families
  covered by approximately 747,000 private retirement plans, 2.5 million health plans,
  and 673,000 other welfare benefit plans holding approximately $11.7 trillion in
  assets; as well as plan sponsors and members of the employee benefits community.
  EBSA balances proactive enforcement with compliance assistance and works diligently
  to provide quality assistance to plan participants and beneficiaries. It is the
  policy of EBSA to provide the highest quality of service to its customers. EBSAs
  mission is to assure the security of the retirement, health and other workplace
  related benefits of America's workers and their families. We will accomplish this
  mission by developing effective regulations; assisting and educating workers, plan
  sponsors, fiduciaries and service providers; and vigorously enforcing the law.
