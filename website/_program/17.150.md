  the administration and enforcement of the civil and criminal provisions of Title
  I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) as well as related

  EBSA is also responsible for assuring compliance with the fiduciary responsibility
  provisions of the Thrift Savings Plan under the Federal Employees' Retirement System
  Act of 1986 (FERSA). The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) is committed

  EBSA balances proactive enforcement with compliance assistance and works diligently

  policy of EBSA to provide the highest quality of service to its customers. EBSAs
  mission is to assure the security of the retirement, health and other workplace
  related benefits of America's workers and their families. We will accomplish this
  mission by developing effective regulations; assisting and educating workers, plan
  sponsors, fiduciaries and service providers; and vigorously enforcing the law.
