objective: The ESP program provide funding that allows agencies to enter into agreements
  with non-profit organizations to provide opportunities to qualified individuals
  55 years of age and older who have specific technical skills and abilities not available

  part of the ESP will support the BSEE on projects related to Renewable Energy, Decommissioning,
  Well Intervention, and others. These projects will enable the BSEE to carry out
