objective: The ESP program provide funding that allows agencies to enter into agreements
  with non-profit organizations to provide opportunities to qualified individuals
  55 years of age and older who have specific technical skills and abilities not available
  or underrepresented at current staffing levels. Qualified individuals who are a
  part of the ESP will support the BSEE on projects related to Renewable Energy, Decommissioning,
  Well Intervention, and others. These projects will enable the BSEE to carry out
  its mission to promote safety, protect the environment, and conserve resources offshore
  through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement. The ESP participants will
