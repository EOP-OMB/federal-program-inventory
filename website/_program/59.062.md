objective: Three year pilot program in which SBA made direct loans of up to $1 million
  at an interest rate of 1 percent to up to 20 nonprofit lending intermediaries each
  year, subject to the availability of funds. Term of ILP loans is for a maximum period
  of 20 years with deferred payments for the first two years. Intermediaries use the
  ILP loan funds to make loans of up to $200,000 to startup, newly established, or
  growing small business concerns. No small business (including affiliates) may have
  more than $200,000 outstanding under this program at one time.
