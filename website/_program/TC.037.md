objective: The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments
  and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. However,
  the Tax Code provides a credit for the purchase of a qualified photovoltaic property
  and solar water heating property, as well as for fuel cell power plants, geothermal
  heat pumps, small wind property, and qualified battery storage technology used in
  or placed on a residence. The credit is 30 percent for property placed in service
  before January 1, 2020, 26 percent for property placed in service in 2020-2021,
  30 percent for property placed in service in 2022-2032, 26 percent for property
  placed in service in 2033, and 22 percent for property placed in service in 2034.
  The credit expires after December 31, 2034.
