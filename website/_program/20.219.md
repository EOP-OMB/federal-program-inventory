- description: 'The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department paired Recreational Trails
    Program funding with State funds to develop a 12-mile trail system at Palo Pinto
    Mountains State Park, the first new State Park in the State in nearly 20 years.
    The trail layout and construction included mitigation measures to protect an endangered
    songbird, the golden-cheeked warbler. The trail system is multiuse for hikers,
    mountain bikers, and equestrians, and includes prominent trail segments with accessible
    grades and hardened tread surfaces.


    The Wyoming Pilot Hill Connector Trail is a nonmotorized, multiuse trail that
    expands recreation options and access both on the Forest and onto the neighboring
    Pilot Hill property. A nearly seven-mile-long connection is now a direct connection
    to the community of Laramie through the Pilot Hill trail system, with trails in
    the Happy Jack/Tie City area.'
