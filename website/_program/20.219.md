    accessibility assessment to develop an inventory of all major public trails across
    the State. The assessment will provide a single digital public access point to

    Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Parks and Recreation Management Program
    partnered with the Wisconsin Horse Council, Outdoor Recreation Alliance Trails,
    and Chippewa Off Road Bicycle Association to offer three sustainable trail design
