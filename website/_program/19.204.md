objective: To provide for reimbursement of losses incurred as a result of the seizure
  of a U.S. commercial fishing vessel by a foreign country on the basis of rights
  or claims in territorial waters or on the high seas, which are not recognized by
  the United States.  Effective November 28, 1990, the United States acknowledges
  the authority of coastal States to manage highly migratory species, thus reducing
  the basis for valid claims under the Fishermen's Protective Act.
