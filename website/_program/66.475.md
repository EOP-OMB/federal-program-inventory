objective: 'The objectives of the Gulf of Mexico Program, housed within the Gulf of
  Mexico Division (GMD) are (1) To assist States, Indian Tribes, interstate agencies,
  and other public or nonprofit organizations in developing and demonstrating innovative
  approaches relating to the causes, effects, extent, prevention, reduction, and elimination
  of water pollution; and (2) To expand and strengthen cooperative efforts to restore
  and protect the health and productivity of the Gulf of Mexico through research,
  studies, experiments, and training, in ways consistent with the economic well-being
  of the region. In fiscal years 22-26, through the Infrastructure Investment and
  Jobs Act (IIJA) funding, the GMD will also prioritize projects focused on water
  quality, ecosystem and wetland restoration, stormwater treatment and control, nature-based
  infrastructure, community resilience, resilient shorelines, and environmental education
  to lessen vulnerability to flooding and the effects of the changing climate in low-income
  and underserved communities. Fiscal Years 2023 and 2024 Funding Priorities: Projects
  that will deliver significant results to achieve the environmental outcomes of improved
  health of the Gulf of Mexico by restoring, protecting and enhancing habitat, improving
  water quality, enhancing community resilience, and furthering environmental education.
  Projects that will assist communities adversely and disproportionately affected
  by environmental and human health harms or risks, including affected underserved
  communities. Through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding,
