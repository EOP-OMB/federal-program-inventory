objective: 'The objectives of the Gulf of Mexico Program, housed within the Gulf of
  Mexico Division (GMD) are (1) To assist States, Indian Tribes, interstate agencies,
  and other public or nonprofit organizations in developing and demonstrating innovative
  approaches relating to the causes, effects, extent, prevention, reduction, and elimination
  of water pollution; and (2) To expand and strengthen cooperative efforts to restore
  and protect the health and productivity of the Gulf of Mexico through research,
  studies, experiments, and training, in ways consistent with the economic well-being
  of the region. In Fiscal Year 2025 priorities include projects that will: 1) deliver
  significant results to achieve the environmental outcomes of improved health of
  the Gulf of Mexico by restoring, protecting and enhancing habitat, improving water
  quality, enhancing community resilience, and furthering environmental education;
  and 2) assist communities adversely and disproportionately affected by environmental
  and human health harms or risks, including affected underserved communities. Through
  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding, the GMD will also prioritize
  projects focused on water quality, ecosystem and wetland restoration, stormwater
  treatment and control, nature-based infrastructure, community resilience, resilient
  shorelines, and environmental education to lessen vulnerability to flooding and
  the effects of the changing climate in low-income and underserved communities.'
