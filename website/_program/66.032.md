objective: 'EPA assists states and federally recognized tribes to provide radon risk
  reduction through activities that will result in increased radon testing, mitigation,
  and radon resistant new construction through the authorizing statute: Title III
  of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Indoor Radon Abatement Act (IRAA),
  Section 306. States and tribes are encouraged to implement projects focused on assisting
  state radon programs, addressing low-income population exposure, expanding radon
  testing of existing homes, increasing mitigation of homes with high radon levels,
  and promoting radon-resistant new construction.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  Recipients will focus on adopting, or seeking
  to adopt, radon building codes for single family homes, expanding coverage and seeking
  opportunities to assist underserved communities, promoting radon awareness through
  the medical community, state cancer control plans, childcare providers and real
  estate transactions, providing training and technical support on voluntary consensus
  standards for radon testing and mitigation, identifying and spreading best practices
  for building homes radon resistant and adopting radon in building codes, providing
  radon awareness building and/or education activities that target homebuyers, informing
  local school systems about radon exposure risk in schools and providing sample school
  testing and mitigation plans, developing or implementing processes to ensure appropriate,
  certification or credentialing of radon testing and mitigation service providers,
  collecting available radon test result data to develop locality-specific classifications
  of radon risks and to support the CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking Network
  radon site. EPA will encourage state and tribal grant recipients to work collaboratively
  with additional government agencies, non-profit organizations and private sector
  partners participating in the National Radon Action Plan (NRAP). (Please see https://www.epa.gov/radon/national-radon-action-plan-strategy-saving-lives
  for the current plan and more information.)'
