objective: 'EPA assists states and federally recognized tribes to provide radon risk
  reduction through activities that will result in increased radon testing, mitigation,
  and radon resistant new construction through the authorizing statute: Title III
  of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Indoor Radon Abatement Act (IRAA),
  Section 306. States and tribes are encouraged to implement projects focused on assisting
  state radon programs, addressing low-income population exposure, expanding radon
  testing of existing homes, increasing mitigation of homes with high radon levels,
  and promoting radon-resistant new construction.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2024:  Recipients will focus on adopting, or seeking
  to adopt, radon building codes for single family homes, expanding coverage and seeking
  opportunities to assist underserved communities, promoting radon awareness through
  the medical community, state cancer control plans, childcare providers and real
  estate transactions, providing training and technical support on voluntary consensus
  standards for radon testing and mitigation, identifying and spreading best practices
  for building homes radon resistant and adopting radon in building codes, providing
  radon awareness building and/or education activities that target homebuyers, informing
  local school systems about radon exposure risk in schools and providing sample school
  testing and mitigation plans, developing or implementing processes to ensure appropriate,
  certification or credentialing of radon testing and mitigation service providers,
  collecting available radon test result data to develop locality-specific classifications
  of radon risks and to support the CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking Network
  radon site. The EPA will encourage state and tribal grant recipients to work collaboratively
  with additional government agencies, non-profit organizations and private sector
  partners participating in the National Radon Action Plan (NRAP). (Please see The
  National Radon Action Plan - A Strategy for Saving Lives  for the current plan and
  more information.)'

- description: 'Not available The SIRG program awarded $7,998,20445 to 45 state and
    6 tribal programs in FY16; 6 Tribes received approximately $200,000 in funding
    in FY16. Program priority areas addressed: • radon-resistant new construction
    techniques in new homes and schools; • disclosure, testing, and mitigation in
    conjunction with residential real estate transactions; • developing radon programs
    in high-risk areas; • activities that improve the effectiveness and viability
    of the program; • developing coalitions that work in partnership with local governments,
    Partner affiliates and others interested in reducing the risk of radon; • setting
    and measuring environmental results goals; • testing and, mitigating schools for
    radon.'
  year: '2016'
- description: 'In FY17, EPA awarded 10 regional SIRG grants totaling $7,911,000.
    In calendar year 2017, an estimated 443,373 existing homes were mitigated to reduce
    high radon levels and approximately 95,752 homes were built with radon-reducing
    features. Much of this progress resulted from the work of coalitions and partnerships
    comprised of local governments, national and local non-profit organizations, industry,
    radon advocates and other leaders. The SIRG program continues to stress the importance
    of achieving and measuring results in: the number of homes, schools, and other
    buildings mitigated for radon; in the number of new homes and schools built with
    radon-reducing features. Recipients are required to include the SIRG results measures
    template in their work plans, and projects with clear risk reduction benefits
    are to be preferred over projects projected to have lesser risk reducing results.'
