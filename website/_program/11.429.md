objective: National marine sanctuaries conduct and support monitoring programs tailored
  to the information needs of each sanctuary. These programs target a wide array of
  topics involving natural processes, human influences on water, habitat, living resources
  and maritime archaeological resources. Research projects within the sanctuary system
  also allow scientists to address information needs that are not recognized through
  site characterization and monitoring.
