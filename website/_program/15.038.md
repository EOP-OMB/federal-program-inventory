  and conventional) and mineral resource potential of Indian reservations; (2) provide
  Tribes with geological, geophysical and engineering reports, maps, and other data
  concerning their energy and mineral resources; (3) provide Tribes technical assistance
  on using and interpreting assessment information so that Tribes can understand and
  plan for the potential development of these resources; and (4) provide Tribes with
  an outreach vehicle to promote their lands and resources to potential partners if
  they so desire.  Those projects that fell into economic development categories will
  be considered for funding through the Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development.'
