rules_regulations: 'FFATA: As noted, FFATA was further amended in 2014 by the Digital
  Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) to, among other items, require summary
  financial data be reported by Federal agencies in addition to Federal award data.
  2 CFR part 25 Federal awards impacted by these requirements include grants, sub-grants,
  loans, awards, cooperative agreements, and other forms of financial assistance as
  well as contracts, subcontracts, purchase orders, task orders, and delivery orders.
  As the purpose of this part is to provide the public with information about how
  their tax dollars are spent, the following information must be provided for primary
  awards receiving federal funds that meet or exceed the micro-purchase threshold
  currently set at $10,000 for procurement contracts and for subawards exceeding $30,000
  reporting. AMS will be leveraging eFG and interfacing directly with USASpending.gov.
  To ensure data quality, AMS will leverage the preexisting processes utilized across
  multiple grant programs administered through eFG. Additionally, our defined monitoring
  and reporting oversight will serve as verification safeguard. Data Quality and Transparency:
  In addition to the normal, multi-phase review and analysis conducted for grantee
  reports, AMS will adhere to the existing MRP Data Accountability and Transparency
  Act (DATA Act) Quality Plan.'
