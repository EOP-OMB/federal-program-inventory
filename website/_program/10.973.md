objective: 'The Emergency Grain Storage Facility Assistance Program (EGSFP) will provide
  assistance to producers affected by: • tornadoes that passed through Kentucky in
  December 2021 • derechos, floods, hurricanes, and winter storms that swept through
  Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Tennessee in
  2022. EGSFP will help impacted producers who are currently struggling with a lack
  of available grain storage and resources needed to properly store their grain crop.
  Producers in eligible areas will receive direct payments to assist with marketing
  and storage disruptions. EGSFP will provide a cost-share payment to assist grain
  producers with building new or used on-farm grain storage capacity and purchase
  drying and handling equipment.'
