objective: 'To support the protection and restoration of the Columbia River Basin
  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Columbia River Basin
  Restoration Program (CRBRP). CRBRP promotes ecosystem protection and restoration
  activities and strategies by working with federal agencies, states, tribes, regional
  water pollution control agencies and entities, local governments, non-governmental
  entities and soil and water conservation districts to improve water quality and
  support environmental protection and restoration. Program has considered relevant
  approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent
  with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order 14052, Implementation
  of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to invest public dollars equitably,
  create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America,
  and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using
  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds. Funding Priorities - Fiscal
  Year 2022 and 2023 : Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) will be used
  to fund grant projects in the Lower Columbia River Estuary and the Middle and Upper
  Columbia River Basin. The priorities for this funding are to improve water quality
  in the Lower Columbia River Estuary, through specific actions to reduce toxics,
  increase monitoring, and/or increase public education and outreach. The two Request
  for Applications issued in FY2023 with IIJA funds are Toxic Reduction Organization
  Leads and a Request for Applications with the focus on Tribal Governments.  The
  second solicitation was to focus on eligible Columbia River Basin eligible Columbia
  River Basin tribal governments to improve water quality in the Columbia River Basin,
  through specific actions to reduce toxics, and/or increase public education and
  outreach.  The Columbia River Basin Restoration Program (CRBRP) will assist tribal,
  state, and local governments; nongovernmental entities, and others as they implement
  the Columbia River Basin Toxics Reduction Action Plan and the Lower Columbia River
  Estuary Plan - Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan and conduct activities
  to support EPA national goals for the Columbia River Basin.'
