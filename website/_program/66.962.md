objective: 'To support the protection and restoration of the Columbia River Basin
  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Columbia River Basin
  Restoration Program (CRBRP). CRBRP promotes ecosystem protection and restoration
  activities and strategies by working with federal agencies, states, tribes, regional
  water pollution control agencies and entities, local governments, non-governmental
  entities and soil and water conservation districts to improve water quality and
  support environmental protection and restoration. Program has considered relevant
  approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent
  with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order 14052, Implementation
  of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to invest public dollars equitably,
  create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America,
  and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using
  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds. Funding Priorities - Fiscal
  Year 2022 and 2023 : Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) will be used
  to fund grant projects in the Lower Columbia River Estuary and the Middle and Upper
  Columbia River Basin. The priorities for this funding are to improve water quality
  in the Lower Columbia River Estuary, through specific actions to reduce toxics,
  increase monitoring, and/or increase public education and outreach. The two Request
  for Applications issued in FY2023 with IIJA funds are Toxic Reduction Organization
  Leads and a Request for Applications with the focus on Tribal Governments.  The
  second solicitation was to focus on eligible Columbia River Basin eligible Columbia
  River Basin tribal governments to improve water quality in the Columbia River Basin,
  through specific actions to reduce toxics, and/or increase public education and
  outreach.  The Columbia River Basin Restoration Program (CRBRP) will assist tribal,
  state, and local governments; nongovernmental entities, and others as they implement
  the Columbia River Basin Toxics Reduction Action Plan and the Lower Columbia River
  Estuary Plan - Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan and conduct activities
  to support EPA national goals for the Columbia River Basin.'

- description: 'Accomplishments under this assistance listing include: **One project
    under this grant program is reducing toxic pollution in the Middle Columbia River
    Basin by educating and inspiring students and community members to prevent pollution
    discharges. Developed four pollution-prevention curriculum modules tailored to
    Columbia River toxic pollution, and pollution prevention and reduction strategies.
    These online curriculum modules are targeted at middle school students in the
    Columbia River Gorge. Modules focus on four topics: Household Contaminants; Stormwater,
    Riparian Zones, and Microplastics.Website here: https://www.columbiariverkeeper.org/engaging-communities/pollution-prevention-curriculum
    Created two bilingual pollution prevention fact sheets completed and distributed
    via web, email, and social media. https://www.columbiariverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/Toxins%20in%20Home_d_Spanish_0.pdf
    https://www.columbiariverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/Toxins%20in%20Home_d.pdf
    Produced two bilingual radio shows produced and aired on Radio Teirra and posted
    on Riverkeeper website as podcasts. Completed two community education webinars
    - "Homebodies and Waterbodies" and "Environmental Advocacy and Justice Perspectives
    from La Comunidad Latina". Together the webinars had 165 attendees who tuned in
    live, and the recordings have been viewed over 1,000 times to-date and will continue
    to be available via our website and social media outlets. In just two of the four
    planned events, total outreach targets of 150 people have been exceeded. https://www.columbiariverkeeper.org/news/2021/3/environmental-advocacy-and-justice

    **The Pesticide Reduction Outreach (PRO) Campaign is a behavior change campaign
    that promotes citizen engagement and knowledge by targeting residential users
    of herbicides and insecticides. 92 participants attended virtual Community Based
    Social Marketing workshop. **Another project will provide on-site technical assistance,
    trainings, resources, and pollution prevention evaluations to automotive and landscaping
    businesses, and expand the Ecological Business Program (EcoBiz). One of eight
    Safer Chemical Alternatives Trainings have taken place (Jan 2021), a second is
    planned for June 2021. Updated EcoBiz Landscaping Checklist. Have reached out
    to 100 businesses and offered Ecobiz technical assistance in landscaping and automotive
    sectors to help implement best practices and reduce toxic chemicals. **Another
    project is expanding an existing stormwater retrofit program that fills a regulatory
    gap by working with businesses on a voluntary basis who do not have a regulatory
    requirement to install stormwater facilities or otherwise manage site-produced
    toxins that impact urban stormwater runoff. These retrofits reduce or eliminate
    pollution and runoff, improve water quality, and protect habitat while promoting
    citizen engagement and knowledge. 70 new businesses have been added to the Stormwater
    Retrofit Project pipeline (Feb 2021) and five of these businesses have carried
    out site visits.'

- description: 'Listed are some accomplishments from projects funded with FY2019-2022
    funds:  1) The GREAT Grattix Box project builds on the proven Grattix Box technology
    developed by the Port of Vancouver. Since their invention, the Port has promoted
    their use, provided detailed building plans, and spread the word about this effective
    and inexpensive stormwater treatment technology.  As a result, numerous companies
    have built and deployed their own Grattix Boxes” and developed a list of 40 potential
    Grattix Box placement sites.  Oregon State University students built 10 Grattix
    Boxes, which were transported  to the Port of Vancouver for storage prior to deployment
    in the project.  Oregon State University created a YouTube video documenting the  experiences
    of the students who built the Grattix boxes:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ3qHqYXtM4.  2)
    With the help of the Palouse Conservation District, one grantee expanded their
    surface water monitoring program to a region and crops they had never sampled
    before. They also removed more than 18,000 pounds of pesticides from these watersheds.
    This has been an amazing opportunity to expand their programs and begin building
    the long-term partnerships they need to work alongside Washington’s growers to
    reduce the number of pesticides entering our waterways.  The Palouse Conservation
    District collected samples from two sites, a total of 32 samples in 2021 and 18
    more so far in 2022. The grantee staff from the Natural Resources Assessment Section
    have collected samples from three sites, 51 in 2021 and 38 so far in 2022. Each
    sample is tested  for more than 150 pesticides and pesticide related chemicals.   They
    have hosted two virtual workshops (Palouse Pesticide Education Event), one in
    February 2021 and one in February 2022, sharing information on Washington State
    Department of Agriculture’s free waste pesticide collection program, the surface
    water monitoring program, and EPA’s pesticide registration review and risk assessment
    process. Each workshop was attended by more than 100 licensed pesticide applicators
    as well as growers from the Palouse region.  The grantee’s Technical Services
    and Education Program collected almost 10,000 pounds of unusable pesticides during
    collection events in the Palouse River Watershed in September 2021 and May 2022.
    The Technical Services and Education Program also collected waste pesticides in
    the Yakima River Watershed in March 2022, where nearly 8,000 pounds of pesticides
    were collected.  3) Another grantee produced the following video “https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG63A3K-iykeGrjLp9xu9tA/videos
    as  part of their "Follow the Water" digital campaign.  This is the description
    of the project included with the video – “Follow the Water is about our relationship
    with our rivers in Oregon, Southwest Washington, and the communities along the
    Columbia River. It’s about connecting people with our water - where we live, work,
    and play. It’s also about connecting our behaviors to the rivers so we understand
    that what we do can change the water both positively and negatively. Ultimately,
    it’s about learning and sharing new ways to be better to our water with your friends
    and neighbors. Whether you are new to the area, or if you have been here your
    whole life, the experience of water is special. It is why many of us choose to
    be here. And that is why the future of our water means so much to us. Follow the
    Water is the work of a voluntary collaborative of over 60 organizations, from
    federal, state, and local governments, watershed councils, Soil & Water Conservation
    Districts, and water related non-profits in our area.”'
