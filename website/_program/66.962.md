objective: 'To support the protection and restoration of the Columbia River Basin
  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Columbia River Basin
  Restoration Program (CRBRP). CRBRP promotes ecosystem protection and restoration
  activities and strategies by working with federal agencies, states, tribes, regional
  water pollution control agencies and entities, local governments, non-governmental
  entities and soil and water conservation districts to improve water quality and
  support environmental protection and restoration. Program has considered relevant
  approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent
  with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order 14052, Implementation
  of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to invest public dollars equitably,
  create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America,
  and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using
  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds. Funding Priorities - Fiscal
  Year 2022 and 2023 : Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) will be used
  to fund grant projects in the Lower Columbia River Estuary and the Middle and Upper
  Columbia River Basin. The priorities for this funding are to improve water quality
  in the Lower Columbia River Estuary, through specific actions to reduce toxics,
  increase monitoring, and/or increase public education and outreach. The two Request
  for Applications issued in FY2023 with IIJA funds are Toxic Reduction Organization
  Leads and a Request for Applications with the focus on Tribal Governments.  The
  second solicitation was to focus on eligible Columbia River Basin eligible Columbia
  River Basin tribal governments to improve water quality in the Columbia River Basin,
  through specific actions to reduce toxics, and/or increase public education and
  outreach.  The Columbia River Basin Restoration Program (CRBRP) will assist tribal,
  state, and local governments; nongovernmental entities, and others as they implement
  the Columbia River Basin Toxics Reduction Action Plan and the Lower Columbia River
  Estuary Plan - Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan and conduct activities
  to support EPA national goals for the Columbia River Basin.'

- description: "Listed are some accomplishments from projects funded with FY2019-2022\
    \ funds:  1) The GREAT Grattix Box project builds on the proven Grattix Box technology\
    \ developed by the Port of Vancouver. Since their invention, the Port has promoted\
    \ their use, provided detailed building plans, and spread the word about this\
    \ effective and inexpensive stormwater treatment technology.  As a result, numerous\
    \ companies have built and deployed their own Grattix Boxes\u201D and developed\
    \ a list of 40 potential Grattix Box placement sites.  Oregon State University\
    \ students built 10 Grattix Boxes, which were transported  to the Port of Vancouver\
    \ for storage prior to deployment in the project.  Oregon State University created\
    \ a YouTube video documenting the  experiences of the students who built the Grattix\
    \ boxes:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ3qHqYXtM4.  2) With the help of the\
    \ Palouse Conservation District, one grantee expanded their surface water monitoring\
    \ program to a region and crops they had never sampled before. They also removed\
    \ more than 18,000 pounds of pesticides from these watersheds. This has been an\
    \ amazing opportunity to expand their programs and begin building the long-term\
    \ partnerships they need to work alongside Washington\u2019s growers to reduce\
    \ the number of pesticides entering our waterways.  The Palouse Conservation District\
    \ collected samples from two sites, a total of 32 samples in 2021 and 18 more\
    \ so far in 2022. The grantee staff from the Natural Resources Assessment Section\
    \ have collected samples from three sites, 51 in 2021 and 38 so far in 2022. Each\
    \ sample is tested  for more than 150 pesticides and pesticide related chemicals.\
    \   They have hosted two virtual workshops (Palouse Pesticide Education Event),\
    \ one in February 2021 and one in February 2022, sharing information on Washington\
    \ State Department of Agriculture\u2019s free waste pesticide collection program,\
    \ the surface water monitoring program, and EPA\u2019s pesticide registration\
    \ review and risk assessment process. Each workshop was attended by more than\
    \ 100 licensed pesticide applicators as well as growers from the Palouse region.\
    \  The grantee\u2019s Technical Services and Education Program collected almost\
    \ 10,000 pounds of unusable pesticides during collection events in the Palouse\
    \ River Watershed in September 2021 and May 2022. The Technical Services and Education\
    \ Program also collected waste pesticides in the Yakima River Watershed in March\
    \ 2022, where nearly 8,000 pounds of pesticides were collected.  3) Another grantee\
    \ produced the following video \u201Chttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG63A3K-iykeGrjLp9xu9tA/videos\
    \ as  part of their \"Follow the Water\" digital campaign.  This is the description\
    \ of the project included with the video \u2013 \u201CFollow the Water is about\
    \ our relationship with our rivers in Oregon, Southwest Washington, and the communities\
    \ along the Columbia River. It\u2019s about connecting people with our water -\
    \ where we live, work, and play. It\u2019s also about connecting our behaviors\
    \ to the rivers so we understand that what we do can change the water both positively\
    \ and negatively. Ultimately, it\u2019s about learning and sharing new ways to\
    \ be better to our water with your friends and neighbors. Whether you are new\
    \ to the area, or if you have been here your whole life, the experience of water\
    \ is special. It is why many of us choose to be here. And that is why the future\
    \ of our water means so much to us. Follow the Water is the work of a voluntary\
    \ collaborative of over 60 organizations, from federal, state, and local governments,\
    \ watershed councils, Soil & Water Conservation Districts, and water related non-profits\
    \ in our area.\u201D"
