objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. However, the Tax Code allowed contractors
  a tax credit of $2,000 for the construction of a qualified new energy-efficient
  home that had an annual level of heating and cooling energy consumption at least
  50 percent below the annual consumption under the 2006 International Energy Conservation
  Code. The credit equaled $1,000 in the case of a new manufactured home that met
  a 30 percent standard or requirements for EPAâ€™s Energy Star homes. This provision
  expired on December 31, 2017, but it was increased up to $5,000 and extended to
  homes acquired in 2023 through 2032.
