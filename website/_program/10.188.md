objective: The Organic Market Development Grant (OMDG) program will support the development
  of new and expanded organic markets by providing additional resources and certainty
  for businesses transitioning to organic or initiating new organic production and
  processing capacity. By investing in certified organic, expanding capacity for aggregation,
  processing, manufacturing, storing, transporting, wholesaling, distribution, or
  consumer markets, the anticipated increase in market activity will both address
  demand for domestically produced agricultural products and the critical need for
  additional market paths identified by domestic organic producers.
