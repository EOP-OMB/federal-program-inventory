objective: "The Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Swift Current grant program makes\
  \ federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, federally recognized tribal\
  \ governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive\
  \ flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National Flood Insurance\
  \ Program (NFIP) following a flood-related disaster event, and to enhance community\
  \ flood resilience within NFIP-participating communities. It does so with a recognition\
  \ of the growing flood hazards associated with climate change, anticipated growth\
  \ of damage and repetitive losses due to flood, and of the need for flood hazard\
  \ risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience\
  \ with respect to flooding. These include both acute, extreme weather events as\
  \ well as chronic stressors that have been observed and are expected to increase\
  \ in the future. \n\nObjectives\nThe purpose of FMA Swift Current is to reduce or\
  \ eliminate the flood risk of repetitive flood damage to structures and buildings\
  \ insured by the NFIP following a flood-related disaster event, and to enhance community\
  \ flood resilience within NFIP-participating communities. \n\nFMA Swift Current\
  \ funds Project Scoping and Individual Flood Mitigation Projects for Repetitive\
  \ Loss (RL), Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL), or properties deemed Substantially Damaged\
  \ after the applicant’s disaster declaration incident period start date. FMA Swift\
  \ Current aims to incentivize flood mitigation projects that will advance equity\
  \ and benefit disadvantaged communities in line with the Administration’s Justice40\
  \ Initiative, established in EO 14008 and discussed in subsequent guidance. FMA\
  \ Swift Current will be identifying a disadvantaged community, also referred to\
  \ as a Justice40 community, using the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool\
  \ (CEJST). FMA Swift Current funds Project Scoping and Individual Flood Mitigation\
  \ Projects for Repetitive Loss (RL), Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL), or properties\
  \ deemed Substantially Damaged after the applicant’s disaster declaration incident\
  \ period start date. Awards made through FMA Swift Current are funded with funds\
  \ appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Pub. L. No.\
  \ 117-58, 135 Stat. 1387–1388 (2021) also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure\
  \ Law (BIL).\n\nGoals\nFY 2024 FMA Swift Current aims to better align the delivery\
  \ of FMA flood mitigation funding to the disaster survivor experience. In FY 2024,\
  \ funds will be made available on a rolling basis to states, territories, and federally\
  \ recognized tribal governments that receive a major disaster declaration for a\
  \ flood-related disaster event and meet all other eligibility criteria. FMA Swift\
  \ Current aims to streamline funding through disaster declaration and flood insurance\
  \ claims based eligibility criteria, minimized application periods, and narrowed\
  \ project type eligibility to Individual Flood Mitigation Projects that are Severe\
  \ Repetitive Loss, Repetitive Loss, and Substantially Damaged. This differs from\
  \ the existing FMA grant opportunity, which has an annual grant cycle that funds\
  \ a broader range of flood mitigation activities, which includes Capability and\
  \ Capacity Building Activities, Localized Flood Risk Reduction Projects, and Individual\
  \ Flood Mitigation Projects through a competitive selection process.\nFMA Swift\
  \ Current aligns with the 2020-2024 DHS Strategic Plan through pursuing Goal 5:\
  \ Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience. Specifically, Objective 5.1: Build a National\
  \ Culture of Preparedness has several sub-objectives that the FMA Program supports.\
  \ FMA Swift Current serves primarily to bolster Sub-Objective 5.1.1: Incentivize\
  \ investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation, including expanding\
  \ the use of insurance to manage risk through funding hazard mitigation projects,\
  \ particularly ones that reduce risk to NFIP-insured structures. Additionally, FMA\
  \ Swift Current’s tailored pre-application support also contributes to other sub-objectives.\
  \ It helps improve awareness initiatives to encourage public action to increase\
  \ preparedness (Sub-Objective 5.1.2), uses lessons from past disasters and exercises\
  \ to inform community investment decisions and anticipate challenges that may emerge\
  \ during future disasters (Sub-Objective 5.1.3), and coordinates and guide continuity\
  \ of operations activities through partnerships with government and non-government\
  \ stakeholders (Sub-Objective 5.1.5). FMA Swift Current also supports the National\
  \ Mitigation Investment Strategy by advancing mitigation investment to reduce risks\
  \ posed by natural hazards and increasing the nation’s resilience to natural hazards.\
  \ \n\nAwards made under this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will be funded\
  \ with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Pub.\
  \ L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 1387–1388 (2021) also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure\
  \ Law (BIL). The BIL is a once-in-a-generation investment in"

results:
- description: FEMA will assess input and output indicators of each federal award
    by measuring the total properties mitigated that are NFIP defined or FMA defined
    Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL), Repetitive Loss (RL), or Substantially Damaged structures
    or properties included in a final mitigation action. FEMA will also assess each
    award output by measuring project capability to positively influence the government’s
    goal of mitigating SRL and RL designated properties and thereby the reduction
    of future losses to the NFIP under this award.
