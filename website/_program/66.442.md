objective: "The objective is to assist small and underserved communities to comply\
  \ with the Safe Water Drinking Act (SDWA). Funding is awarded to states and territories,\
  \ including a tribal allotment, for projects/activities that are necessary for public\
  \ water systems to comply with national drinking water standards established by\
  \ SDWA.  Funding will continue to support projects and activities that benefit underserved\
  \ communities. Underserved communities include those communities that do not have\
  \ household drinking water or wastewater services; or are served by a public water\
  \ system that violates or exceeds a requirement of a national primary drinking water\
  \ regulation issued under SDWA section 1412, including a maximum contaminant level;\
  \ a treatment technique; or an action level. \n\nThe objective is to assist small\
  \ or disadvantaged communities in addressing emerging contaminants in drinking water.\
  \ Awards are funded by appropriations established by the Infrastructure Investment\
  \ and Jobs Act (IIJA). Funding is awarded to states and territories, including a\
  \ tribal allotment, for: 1) programs to provide household water quality testing,\
  \ including testing for unregulated contaminants, and 2) activities necessary for\
  \ a state to respond to a contaminant. Projects/activities are to assist public\
  \ water systems in small and disadvantaged communities to provide support towards\
  \ reduction and remediation of emerging contaminants. The funding priority will\
  \ continue to be projects and activities that benefit small or disadvantaged communities.\
  \ Small communities include those will populations less than 10,000 individuals.\
  \ Disadvantaged communities are those that meet affordability criteria established\
  \ by the state in which the project takes place."
