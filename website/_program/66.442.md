  \ water quality testing, including testing for unregulated contaminants; and (3)\
  \ activities necessary for a state to respond to a contaminant. Projects/activities\
  \ under this grant program, other than those funded with Infrastructure Investment\

  \ water regulation issued under SDWA section 1412, including a maximum contaminant\
  \ level; a treatment technique; or an action level. \n\nFunding Priority - Fiscal\
