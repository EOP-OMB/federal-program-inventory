objective: 'Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Grant (HMEP): To increase State,
  local, territorial and tribal effectiveness to safely and efficiently handle hazardous
  materials accidents and incidents; enhance implementation of the Emergency Planning
  and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA); and encourage a comprehensive approach
  to emergency planning and training by incorporating response to transportation standards.
  Hazardous Materials Instructor Training Grant (HMIT): To facilitate a “train the
  trainer” program to train hazmat instructors who will then train hazmat employees
  in the proper handling of hazardous materials. Supplemental Public Sector Training
  Grants (SPST): to facilitate the training of instructors, thereby increasing the
  number of training instructors available to conduct hazardous materials responder
  training programs for individuals with statutory responsibility to respond to hazardous
  materials accidents and incidents. Assistance for Local Emergency Response Training
  Grant (ALERT): to promote hazmat response training for volunteer or remote emergency
  responders to respond to incidents or accidents involving the transportation of
  crude oil, ethanol and other flammable liquids by rail. Hazardous Materials Community
  Safety Grants (CS): to conduct national outreach and training programs to assist
  communities in preparing for and responding to accidents and incidents involving
  the transportation of hazardous materials, including Class 3 flammable liquids by
  rail; and train State and local personnel responsible for enforcing the safe transportation
  of hazardous materials, including Class 3 flammable liquids.'

  year: '2016'
- description: "More first responders trained to respond to transportation-related\
    \ hazmat incidents which increases response capabilities for hazmat transportation\
    \ incidents and accidents. \tMore communities prepared for transportation-related\
    \ hazmat accidents and incidents which leads to a reduction in the severity and\
    \ costs of accidents and incidents. More hazmat employees trained to properly\
    \ package and ship hazmat which reduces the number of hazmat transportation incidents\
    \ and accidents.\nIncreased community awareness of hazardous materials in local\
    \ communities\nMore trained enforcement inspectors which reduces the risk of hazmat\
    \ transportation incidents and accidents"
