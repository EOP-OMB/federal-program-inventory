objective: 'The purpose of this cooperative agreement program is to support and/or
  create model state, local, and/or tribal activities that lead to measurable environmental
  or public health results in communities disproportionately burdened by environmental
  harms and risks. These models should leverage or utilize existing resources or assets
  of state, tribal, local, and territorial agencies to develop key tools and processes
  that integrate environmental justice considerations into all levels of government
  and government programs.  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  The EJG2G program
  goals are to (1) achieve measurable and meaningful environmental and/or public health
  results in communities; (2) build broad and robust, results-oriented partnerships,
  particularly with community-based nonprofit organizations (CBO) within disproportionately
  impacted areas; (3) pilot activities in specific communities that create transferable
  models, which can be expanded or replicated in other geographic areas and; (4) strengthen
  the development and implementation of meaningful approaches to achieve environmental
  justice.'
