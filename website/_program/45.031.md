objective: This initiative is designed to provide opportunities for internships and
  fellowships at American Latino museums for students enrolled in Institutions of
  Higher Education, including Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). The initiative
  will nurture students carrying out studies relating to American Latino life, art,
  history, and culture. There are two programmatic goals--supporting museum-based
  undergraduate internship programs and museum-based fellowships to increase museum
  career opportunities. Please see the Notice of Funding Opportunity for details of
  the specific goals and objectives for the initiative.
