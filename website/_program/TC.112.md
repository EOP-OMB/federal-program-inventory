objective: The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures.
  In contrast, the Tax Code provides taxpayers a deduction for contributions to nonprofit
  educational institutions that are similar to personal expenditures. Moreover, taxpayers
  who donate capital assets to educational institutions can deduct the asset’s current
  value without being taxed on any appreciation in value. An individual’s total charitable
  contribution generally may not exceed 50 percent (60 percent for tax years 2018
  through 2025) of adjusted gross income; a corporation’s total charitable contributions
  generally may not exceed 10 percent of pre-tax income.
