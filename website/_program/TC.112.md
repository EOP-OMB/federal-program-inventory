objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, the Tax
  Code allows certain professionals who perform in underserved areas or specific fields,
  and as a consequence have their student loans discharged, not to recognize such
  discharge as income.
