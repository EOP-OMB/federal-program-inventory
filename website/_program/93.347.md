objective: "The purpose of this program is to support efforts to advance the establishment\
  \ of an interoperable health system that (1) empowers individuals to use their electronic\
  \ health information to the fullest extent (2) enables providers and communities\
  \ to deliver smarter, safer, and more efficient care, and (3) promotes innovation\
  \ at all levels. The Draft Trusted Exchange Framework, released on January 5, 2018,\
  \ advances the goals of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) to advance nationwide\
  \ interoperability by creating a common set of principles, terms, and conditions\
  \ that facilitate trust between health information networks (HINs). \n\nThe Draft\
  \ Trusted Exchange Framework contains two parts: Part A\u2014Principles for Trusted\
  \ Exchange and Part B\u2014Minimum Required Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange.\
  \ Part A provides guard rails and general principles that HINs  and Qualified HINs\
  \  should follow to engender trust amongst Participants and End Users. Part B provides\
  \ specific minimum required terms and conditions to be included into a single Common\
  \ Agreement by a RCE. ONC will review comments received on Part A and Part B to\
  \ develop a final Trusted Exchange Framework that the RCE would assist in implementing.\
  \ \n\nPart B of the Draft Trusted Exchange Framework is not intended to be an all-encompassing\
  \ participation agreement, but rather includes provisions to address identified\
  \ areas of variation across existing network agreements. This funding opportunity\
  \ announcement seeks to identify a single RCE that will \u2013 in collaboration\
  \ with ONC \u2013 incorporate the final Part B requirements into a single Common\
  \ Agreement to which Qualified HINs and their Participants may voluntarily agree\
  \ to adhere. Development of a single, all-encompassing agreement that is nationwide\
  \ in scope will significantly reduce the need for one-off or point-to-point interfaces,\
  \ which are costly, complex to create and maintain, and an inefficient use of provider\
  \ and health IT developer resources."
