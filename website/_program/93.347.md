objective: "The purpose of this program is to support efforts to advance the establishment\
  \ of an interoperable health system that (1) empowers individuals to use their electronic\
  \ health information to the fullest extent (2) enables providers and communities\
  \ to deliver smarter, safer, and more efficient care, and (3) promotes innovation\
  \ at all levels. The Draft Trusted Exchange Framework, released on January 5, 2018,\
  \ advances the goals of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) to advance nationwide\
  \ interoperability by creating a common set of principles, terms, and conditions\
  \ that facilitate trust between health information networks (HINs). \n\nThe Draft\
  \ Trusted Exchange Framework contains two parts: Part A—Principles for Trusted Exchange\
  \ and Part B—Minimum Required Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange. Part A\
  \ provides guard rails and general principles that HINs  and Qualified HINs  should\
  \ follow to engender trust amongst Participants and End Users. Part B provides specific\
  \ minimum required terms and conditions to be included into a single Common Agreement\
  \ by a RCE. ONC will review comments received on Part A and Part B to develop a\
  \ final Trusted Exchange Framework that the RCE would assist in implementing. \n\
  \nPart B of the Draft Trusted Exchange Framework is not intended to be an all-encompassing\
  \ participation agreement, but rather includes provisions to address identified\
  \ areas of variation across existing network agreements. This funding opportunity\
  \ announcement seeks to identify a single RCE that will – in collaboration with\
  \ ONC – incorporate the final Part B requirements into a single Common Agreement\
  \ to which Qualified HINs and their Participants may voluntarily agree to adhere.\
  \ Development of a single, all-encompassing agreement that is nationwide in scope\
  \ will significantly reduce the need for one-off or point-to-point interfaces, which\
  \ are costly, complex to create and maintain, and an inefficient use of provider\
  \ and health IT developer resources."
