objective: "Up to six cooperative agreements will be established with organizations\
  \ that are capable of developing and implementing technical assistance (TA), planning,\
  \ and capacity building to improve and foster thriving communities through transportation\
  \ improvements. The selected organizations will offer support to disadvantaged communities,\
  \ enabling them to plan and develop a pipeline of transportation and community revitalization\
  \ activities that increase mobility, reduce pollution from transportation sources,\
  \ expand affordable transportation options, facilitate efficient land use, preserve\
  \ or expand jobs, improve housing conditions, enhance connections to health care,\
  \ education, and food security, or improve health outcomes. \nThe selected Capacity\
  \ Builder organizations will support three Communities of Practice (or “cohorts”).\
  \ A Capacity Builder will be assigned to each cohort; and paired with a set of 10-15\
  \ communities to provide the support detailed in the NOFO and finalized in their\
  \ scope of work. The cohort model will make use of peer learning, customized services,\
  \ and subject matter expertise. The Communities of Practice include: \n\nMain Streets\
  \ – Focused on Tribal and rural communities and the interconnected transportation,\
  \ community, and economic development issues they face.  \n\nComplete Neighborhoods\
  \ – Focused on urban and suburban communities located within Metropolitan Planning\
  \ Organization (MPO) planning areas working to better coordinate transportation\
  \ with land use, housing, and economic development.   \n\nNetworked Communities\
  \ – Focused on those communities located near ports, airports, freight, and rail\
  \ facilities to address mobility, access, housing, environmental justice, and economic\
  \ issues."
