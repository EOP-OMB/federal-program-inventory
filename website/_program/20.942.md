  \ Regional and 3 National) were selected for FY23 funding. Each are under a cooperative\
  \ agreement and are currently providing technical assistance (TA), planning, and\
  \ capacity building to improve and foster thriving communities through transportation\
  \ improvements. The selected organizations offer support to disadvantaged communities,\

  \ activities that increase mobility, reduce pollution from transportation sources,\
  \ expand affordable transportation options, facilitate efficient land use, preserve\
  \ or expand jobs, improve housing conditions, enhance connections to health care,\
  \ education, and food security, or improve health outcomes. \nThe selected Capacity\
  \ Builder organizations support Communities of Practice (or “cohorts”).  Each Capacity\
  \ Builder is assigned to a cohort; and paired with a set of 10-15 communities to\
  \ provide the support detailed in the NOFO and finalized in their scope of work.\
