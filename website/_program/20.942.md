objective: "Up to six cooperative agreements will be established with organizations\
  \ that are capable of developing and implementing technical assistance (TA), planning,\
  \ and capacity building to improve and foster thriving communities through transportation\
  \ improvements. The selected organizations will offer support to disadvantaged communities,\
  \ enabling them to plan and develop a pipeline of transportation and community revitalization\
  \ activities that increase mobility, reduce pollution from transportation sources,\
  \ expand affordable transportation options, facilitate efficient land use, preserve\
  \ or expand jobs, improve housing conditions, enhance connections to health care,\
  \ education, and food security, or improve health outcomes. \nThe selected Capacity\
  \ Builder organizations will support three Communities of Practice (or \u201Ccohorts\u201D\
  ). A Capacity Builder will be assigned to each cohort; and paired with a set of\
  \ 10-15 communities to provide the support detailed in the NOFO and finalized in\
  \ their scope of work. The cohort model will make use of peer learning, customized\
  \ services, and subject matter expertise. The Communities of Practice include: \n\
  \nMain Streets \u2013 Focused on Tribal and rural communities and the interconnected\
  \ transportation, community, and economic development issues they face.\u202F \n\
  \nComplete Neighborhoods \u2013 Focused on urban and suburban communities located\
  \ within Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) planning areas working to better\
  \ coordinate transportation with land use, housing, and economic development.\u202F\
  \u202F \n\nNetworked Communities \u2013 Focused on those communities located near\
  \ ports, airports, freight, and rail facilities to address mobility, access, housing,\
  \ environmental justice, and economic issues."
