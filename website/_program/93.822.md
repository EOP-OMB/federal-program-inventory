  \ HCOP Academies, strives to develop a more competitive applicant pool to build\
  \ diversity in the health professions. The Program's goal is to provide students\
  \ from economically and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds who are interested\
  \ in pursuing a health profession to develop the needed skills to compete for, enter,\
  \ and graduate from a health or allied health professions program, graduate program\
  \ in behavioral and mental health, and/or programs for the training of physician\
  \ assistants. HCOP strives to improve retention, matriculation and graduation rates\
  \ by implementing tailored enrichment programs designed to address the academic\
  \ and social needs of trainees from disadvantaged backgrounds. It also provides\
  \ opportunities for community-based health professions training, emphasizing experiences\
  \ in underserved communities. HCOP focuses on three key milestones of education:\
  \ (1) graduation from high school; (2) retention and graduation from college; and\
  \ (3) acceptance, retention, and completion of a health career\u2019s degree program."
