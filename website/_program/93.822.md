objective: 'The Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP), also known as the National
  HCOP Academies, strives to develop a more competitive applicant pool to build diversity
  in the health professions. The Program''s goal is to provide students from economically
  and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds who are interested in pursuing a health
  profession to develop the needed skills to compete for, enter, and graduate from
  a health or allied health professions program, graduate program in behavioral and
  mental health, and/or programs for the training of physician assistants. HCOP strives
  to improve retention, matriculation and graduation rates by implementing tailored
  enrichment programs designed to address the academic and social needs of trainees
  from disadvantaged backgrounds. It also provides opportunities for community-based
  health professions training, emphasizing experiences in underserved communities.
  HCOP focuses on three key milestones of education: (1) graduation from high school;
  (2) retention and graduation from college; and (3) acceptance, retention, and completion
  of a health careerâ€™s degree program.'
