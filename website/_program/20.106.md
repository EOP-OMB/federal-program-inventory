objective: "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has several strategic goals:\
  \ Safety, People, Global Leadership, and Operational excellence. The FAA Office\
  \ of Airports (ARP) grant programs described in this listing contribute to these\
  \ goals, as outlined in the FAA Annual Summary of Performance and Financial Information.\
  \ \n\nThe ARP mission is planning and developing a safe and efficient national airports\
  \ system to satisfy the needs of the aviation interests of the U.S., with considerations\
  \ for economics, environmental issues, local proprietary rights, and safeguarding\
  \ the public investment. As an important component of that mission, ARP provides\
  \ financial assistance to airports nationwide through grants. These grants contribute\
  \ to the objective of maintaining and optimizing airport and runway safety, capacity,\
  \ efficiency, financial responsibility, and environmental sustainability. The program\
  \ objective of this listing is to assist sponsors, owners, or operators of public-use\
  \ airports in the development of a nationwide system of airports adequate to meet\
  \ the needs of civil aeronautics. \n\nThe purpose of the various laws applicable\
  \ to this program includes the investment in transportation, environmental protection,\
  \ and airport infrastructure that will support long-term economic benefits. Grants\
  \ to airports also support the objectives of several Executive Orders, including\
  \ Executive Order 13985 \u2013 \u201CExecutive Order on Advancing Racial Equity\
  \ and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government\u201D,\
  \ Executive Order 14005 \u2013 \u201CEnsuring the Future is Made in all of America\
  \ by All of America\u2019s Workers\u201D, and Executive Order 14008 \u2013 \u201C\
  Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad\u201D (as listed in the Regulations\
  \ and Guidance Section). Performance measurement and reporting. An example of performance\
  \ measurement: In the mission area of safety, the FAA Business Plan has several\
  \ Initiatives, including the Initiative on Runway Pavement Maintenance. This initiative\
  \ ensures that airport infrastructure is kept in a safe and serviceable condition\
  \ through capital improvements and airport inspections. The related activity is\
  \ to ensure runway pavement is kept in a safe and serviceable condition by maintaining\
  \ eligible runway pavement in Excellent, Good, or Fair condition. The performance\
  \ measure, as a specific target metric, is ensuring that this condition is met (based\
  \ on visual inspections) for 93 percent of the paved runways in the National Plan\
  \ of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). The financial assistance provided through\
  \ these federal grants contribute to the capital improvements mentioned above. For\
  \ performance reporting, all grants are required to submit performance reports (Annually\
  \ for non-construction grants: FAA Form 5100-140 Performance Report, and quarterly\
  \ for construction grants: FAA Form 5370-1 Construction Progress and Inspection\
  \ Report). These reports include reporting on project milestone goals as well as\
  \ lab and field testing for construction projects. With a standard period of performance\
  \ of 4 years, projects must be completed within that timeframe. Projects are monitored\
  \ throughout the period of performance and grant disbursements are regularly tracked.\
  \ The program office monitors period of performance expirations and grant closeout\
  \ in order to confirm successful project completion. A key performance indicator\
  \ for the program in this listing is number of grant projects successfully completed\
  \ and closed out. This measurement of grant funding disbursement as well as progress\
  \ of projects towards completion aligns with and is reported on in the FAA\u2019\
  s Annual Performance and Accountability Report."
