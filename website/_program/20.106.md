objective: "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has several strategic goals:\
  \ Safety, People, Global Leadership, and Operational excellence. The FAA Office\
  \ of Airports (ARP) grant programs described in this listing contribute to these\
  \ goals, as outlined in the FAA Annual Summary of Performance and Financial Information.\
  \ \n\nThe ARP mission is planning and developing a safe and efficient national airports\
  \ system to satisfy the needs of the aviation interests of the U.S., with considerations\
  \ for economics, environmental issues, local proprietary rights, and safeguarding\
  \ the public investment. As an important component of that mission, ARP provides\
  \ financial assistance to airports nationwide through grants. These grants contribute\
  \ to the objective of maintaining and optimizing airport and runway safety, capacity,\
  \ efficiency, financial responsibility, and environmental sustainability. The program\
  \ objective of this listing is to assist sponsors, owners, or operators of public-use\
  \ airports in the development of a nationwide system of airports adequate to meet\
  \ the needs of civil aeronautics. \n\nThe purpose of the various laws applicable\
  \ to this program includes the investment in transportation, environmental protection,\
  \ and airport infrastructure that will support long-term economic benefits. Grants\
  \ to airports also support the objectives of several Executive Orders, including\
  \ Executive Order 13985 – “Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support\
  \ for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government”, Executive Order 14005\
  \ – “Ensuring the Future is Made in all of America by All of America’s Workers”,\
  \ and Executive Order 14008 – “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad” (as\
  \ listed in the Regulations and Guidance Section). Performance measurement and reporting.\
  \ An example of performance measurement: In the mission area of safety, the FAA\
  \ Business Plan has several Initiatives, including the Initiative on Runway Pavement\
  \ Maintenance. This initiative ensures that airport infrastructure is kept in a\
  \ safe and serviceable condition through capital improvements and airport inspections.\
  \ The related activity is to ensure runway pavement is kept in a safe and serviceable\
  \ condition by maintaining eligible runway pavement in Excellent, Good, or Fair\
  \ condition. The performance measure, as a specific target metric, is ensuring that\
  \ this condition is met (based on visual inspections) for 93 percent of the paved\
  \ runways in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). The financial\
  \ assistance provided through these federal grants contribute to the capital improvements\
  \ mentioned above. For performance reporting, all grants are required to submit\
  \ performance reports (Annually for non-construction grants: FAA Form 5100-140 Performance\
  \ Report, and quarterly for construction grants: FAA Form 5370-1 Construction Progress\
  \ and Inspection Report). These reports include reporting on project milestone goals\
  \ as well as lab and field testing for construction projects. With a standard period\
  \ of performance of 4 years, projects must be completed within that timeframe. Projects\
  \ are monitored throughout the period of performance and grant disbursements are\
  \ regularly tracked. The program office monitors period of performance expirations\
  \ and grant closeout in order to confirm successful project completion. A key performance\
  \ indicator for the program in this listing is number of grant projects successfully\
  \ completed and closed out. This measurement of grant funding disbursement as well\
  \ as progress of projects towards completion aligns with and is reported on in the\
  \ FAA’s Annual Performance and Accountability Report."

  year: '2016'
- description: "The Airport Improvement Program awarded $3,314,339,779 in funding\
    \ to support airport infrastructure grants to states and territories. A partial\
    \ list of accomplishments includes runway reconstruction and rehabilitation; construction\
    \ of firefighting facilities; and improvements to taxiways, aprons, and terminals.\
    \ The construction and equipment supported by this funding increases the airports’\
    \ safety, emergency response capabilities, and capacity; and could support further\
    \ economic growth and development within each airport’s region. \nSome examples\
    \ of funded projects include:\n•\t$7.3 million awarded to repair an airport apron\
    \ where aircraft park.\n•\t$18.9 million awarded to repair taxiways and construct\
    \ a new taxiway to provide access to hangars; and the purchase of an emergency\
    \ generator for the airport during inclement weather.\n•\t$2.4 million awarded\
    \ to install sound insulation noise mitigation measures for residences near the\
    \ airport"
