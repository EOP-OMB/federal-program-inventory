objective: 'The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) amends the Clean Air Act to include
  Section 134 (42 USC § 7434), which authorizes the EPA to make competitive grants
  under the National Clean Investment Fund. The National Clean Investment Fund is
  currently funded by two separate appropriations to make competitive grants to eligible
  recipients: $11.97 billion from Section 134(a)(2) and $2 billion from Section 134(a)(3)
  (out of $8 billion provided in Section 134(a)(3)). The National Clean Investment
  Fund implements the statute’s use of funds for direct investments under Section
  134(b)(1). Section 134(b)(1) directs recipients of funds for direct investments
  to (A) provide financial assistance to qualified projects at the national, regional,
  state, and local levels; (B) prioritize investment in qualified projects that would
  otherwise lack access to financing; and (C) retain, manage, recycle, and monetize
  all repayments and other revenue received from fees, interest, repaid loans, and
  any other financial assistance provided using the grant funds to ensure continued
  operability.'
