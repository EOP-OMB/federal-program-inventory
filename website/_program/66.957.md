objective: "Section 60103 of Public Law 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 (August 16, 2022),\
  \ commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), added Section 134\
  \ to the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \xA7 7434, to establish the Greenhouse Gas Reduction\
  \ Fund (GGRF). The GGRF will make funding available on a competitive basis for financial\
  \ and technical assistance for projects that reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions\
  \ and other forms of air pollution, with a particular emphasis on projects in low-income\
  \ and disadvantaged communities. The overarching objectives of the GGRF are to (1)\
  \ reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants; (2) deliver benefits\
  \ to low-income and disadvantaged communities; and (3) mobilize financing and private\
  \ capital to stimulate additional deployment of greenhouse gas and air pollution\
  \ reducing projects.  The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will be implemented via\
  \ two programs:  1) The $7 billion Zero-Emissions Technologies Program, which will\
  \ award $7 billion in competitive grants to implement Clean Air Act Section 134\
  \ (a)(1), and 2) The $19.97 billion General Assistance and Low-Income and Disadvantaged\
  \ Communities Program, which will award $19.97 billion in competitive grants to\
  \ implement Clean Air Act Section 134(a)(2) and Section 134(a)(3).  This assistance\
  \ listing (66.957) describes the $19.97 billion General Assistance and Low-Income\
  \ and Disadvantaged Communities Program. A related assistance listing (66.959) describes\
  \ the $7 billion Zero-Emissions Technologies Program.  Funding priorities will be\
  \ described in the Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFO)."
