objective: "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) amends the Clean Air Act to include\
  \ Section 134 (42 USC \xA7 7434), which authorizes the EPA to make competitive grants\
  \ under the National Clean Investment Fund. The National Clean Investment Fund is\
  \ currently funded by two separate appropriations to make competitive grants to\
  \ eligible recipients: $11.97 billion from Section 134(a)(2) and $2 billion from\
  \ Section 134(a)(3) (out of $8 billion provided in Section 134(a)(3)). The National\
  \ Clean Investment Fund implements the statute\u2019s use of funds for direct investments\
  \ under Section 134(b)(1). Section 134(b)(1) directs recipients of funds for direct\
  \ investments to (A) provide financial assistance to qualified projects at the national,\
  \ regional, state, and local levels; (B) prioritize investment in qualified projects\
  \ that would otherwise lack access to financing; and (C) retain, manage, recycle,\
  \ and monetize all repayments and other revenue received from fees, interest, repaid\
  \ loans, and any other financial assistance provided using the grant funds to ensure\
  \ continued operability."
