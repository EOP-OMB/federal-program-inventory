objective: "The purpose of the FY 2023 EMBAG cooperative agreement is to support the\
  \ use of national-level standards for emergency management to help ensure that state,\
  \ local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) communities have accredited emergency management\
  \ programs and certified emergency managers in place before an incident occurs.\
  \ To achieve this purpose, the EMBAG supports voluntary national-level standards\
  \ and peer review assessment processes that communities can use to identify the\
  \ capacity and shortfalls of their emergency management programs and emergency managers\
  \ and develop a path to compliance with these standards. These national-level standards\
  \ fall under “other assistance” called out under Section 503 (b)(2)(G) of the Homeland\
  \ Security Act of 2002 to “build tribal, local, State, regional, and national capabilities…necessary\
  \ to respond to a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster.”\
  \ See 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(2)(G).\n\nThe EMBAG directly supports the DHS Strategic\
  \ Plan Fiscal Years 2020-2024, Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience, Objective\
  \ 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness and Objective 5.2: Respond During\
  \ Incidents, by supporting efforts that can help ensure that state, tribal, territorial,\
  \ and local communities have accredited emergency management programs and certified\
  \ emergency managers in place before an incident occurs. \nThe EMBAG program reinforces\
  \ FEMA’s mission of advancing all-hazards preparedness, consistent with the Post-Katrina\
  \ Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) and Presidential Policy Directive\
  \ 8 (PPD-8), National Preparedness. The EMBAG program supports the 2022-2026 FEMA\
  \ Strategic Plan Objective 3.1 through its support of national-level standards and\
  \ assessment processes that emergency management programs and emergency managers\
  \ can use to improve their preparedness capabilities to prevent, protect against,\
  \ mitigate the effects of, respond to and recover from the threats and hazards that\
  \ pose the greatest risk to the security of the nation.\nThe performance of the\
  \ EMBAG is measured against the intended outcomes identified in the Objectives section\
  \ of Section A: Program Description in the FY 2023 EMBAG NOFO. Applicants should\
  \ refer to Appendix B: Detail on EMBAG Performance Measurement of the FY 2023 EMBAG\
  \ NOFO for additional information on these metrics, including guidance and a template\
  \ for reporting. Please refer to the FY 2023 NOFO for additional information: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=349090.\

  \nThe Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP) and International Association\
  \ of Emergency Managers (IAEM) are the past recipients of the EMBAG. EMAP maintains\
  \ a voluntary standards, assessment, and accreditation process for disaster preparedness\
  \ programs, and it is the only known peer reviewed accreditation process for emergency\
  \ management programs in the United States. IAEM owns the trademark registered Certified\
  \ Emergency Manager (CEM)® program, which is a voluntary standards, assessment,\
  \ and certification process for emergency managers and disaster response professionals\
  \ from all levels of government, the private sector and volunteer organizations."
