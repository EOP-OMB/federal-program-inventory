objective: "The purpose of the FY 2023 EMBAG cooperative agreement is to support the\
  \ use of national-level standards for emergency management to help ensure that state,\
  \ local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) communities have accredited emergency management\
  \ programs and certified emergency managers in place before an incident occurs.\
  \ To achieve this purpose, the EMBAG supports voluntary national-level standards\
  \ and peer review assessment processes that communities can use to identify the\
  \ capacity and shortfalls of their emergency management programs and emergency managers\
  \ and develop a path to compliance with these standards. These national-level standards\
  \ fall under \u201Cother assistance\u201D called out under Section 503 (b)(2)(G)\
  \ of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to \u201Cbuild tribal, local, State, regional,\
  \ and national capabilities\u2026necessary to respond to a natural disaster, act\
  \ of terrorism, or other man-made disaster.\u201D See 6 U.S.C. \xA7 313(b)(2)(G).\n\
  \nThe EMBAG directly supports the DHS Strategic Plan Fiscal Years 2020-2024, Goal\
  \ 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience, Objective 5.1: Build a National Culture\
  \ of Preparedness and Objective 5.2: Respond During Incidents, by supporting efforts\
  \ that can help ensure that state, tribal, territorial, and local communities have\
  \ accredited emergency management programs and certified emergency managers in place\
  \ before an incident occurs. \nThe EMBAG program reinforces FEMA\u2019s mission\
  \ of advancing all-hazards preparedness, consistent with the Post-Katrina Emergency\
  \ Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) and Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8),\
  \ National Preparedness. The EMBAG program supports the 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic\
  \ Plan Objective 3.1 through its support of national-level standards and assessment\
  \ processes that emergency management programs and emergency managers can use to\
  \ improve their preparedness capabilities to prevent, protect against, mitigate\
  \ the effects of, respond to and recover from the threats and hazards that pose\
  \ the greatest risk to the security of the nation.\nThe performance of the EMBAG\
  \ is measured against the intended outcomes identified in the Objectives section\
  \ of Section A: Program Description in the FY 2023 EMBAG NOFO. Applicants should\
  \ refer to Appendix B: Detail on EMBAG Performance Measurement of the FY 2023 EMBAG\
