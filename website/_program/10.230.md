objective: Farm of the Future is a competitive grant program that establishes an agricultural
  test bed and demonstration site. Farm of the Future seeks to launch this rural test
  bed for precision agriculture, smart automation, and data connectivity and transfer
  to demonstrate best practices in production agriculture and animal systems that
  enhance sustainability and farm profitability. The test bed will evaluate smart
  technologies [autonomous robotics, remote sensing, artificial intelligence, machine
  learning, Internet of Things, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), satellites], to provide
  accessible, data-driven solutions that support resilient agricultural and value-added
  practices.  The Farm of the Future seeks to optimize climate-smart agricultural
  productivity, environmental health, and natural resources management.
