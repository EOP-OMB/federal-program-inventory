objective: Section 4007 of Public Law 114-322, also known as The Water Infrastructure
  Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act allows the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate
  and enter into an agreement on behalf of the United States for the design, study
  and construction or expansion of federally owned or State-led water storage project.
  The Secretary may participate in a federally owned storage project “in an amount
  equal to not more than 50 percent of the total cost of the federally owned storage
  project,” (4007(b)(2)) and may participate in a State-led storage project “in an
  amount equal to not more than 25 percent of the total cost of the State-led storage
  project” (4007(c)(1)). In return for this cost-share, “at least a proportional share
  of the project benefits are the Federal benefits, including water supplies dedicated
  to specific purposes such as environmental enhancement and wildlife refuges” (4007(c)(2)(C)).
  To be eligible for funding, the Secretary of the Interior must have determined the
  project to be feasible before January 1, 2021.
