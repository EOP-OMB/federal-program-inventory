objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including deferred and
  dedicated payments, should be included in taxable income. In addition, investment
  income would be taxed as earned. In contrast, under current law individual taxpayers
  and employers can make tax-preferred contributions to employer-provided 401(k) and
  similar plans (e.g. 403(b) plans and the Federal Government’s Thrift Savings Plan).
  In 2024, an employee could exclude up to $23,000 of wages from AGI under a qualified
  arrangement with an employer’s 401(k) plan. Employees age 50 or over could exclude
  up to $30,500 in contributions. The defined contribution plan limit, including both
  employee and employer contributions, is $69,000 in 2024. The tax on contributions
  made by both employees and employers and the investment income earned by these plans
  is deferred until withdrawn.
