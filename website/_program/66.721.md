objective: "The goal of the Reducing Embodied Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Construction\
  \ Materials and Products grant program is to support the development, enhanced standardization\
  \ and transparency, and reporting criteria for environmental product declarations\
  \ (EPDs) which include the measurement of embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated\
  \ with all relevant stages of production, use, and disposal, in conformance with\
  \ international standards. In support of this goal, EPA will provide grants to businesses\
  \ that manufacture, remanufacture, and refurbish construction materials and products\
  \ for developing and verifying environmental product declarations, and to States,\
  \ Indian Tribes, and nonprofit organizations that will support such businesses.\
  \  \n\nUnder this program, EPA plans to award in FY24 up to 40 grants and/or cooperative\
  \ agreements, some potentially as \"pass-through\" grants to eligible entities.\
  \   \n\nPer the Code of Federal Regulations (2 CFR 200.74), a pass-through entity\
  \ is defined as a non-Federal entity that provides a subaward to a subrecipient\
  \ to carry out part of a federal program.  \n\nThis grant program will lead to progress\
  \ towards achieving the objectives of Section 60112 of the Inflation Reduction Act."
