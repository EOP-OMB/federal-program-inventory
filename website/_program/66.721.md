objective: "The goal of the Reducing Embodied Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Construction\
  \ Materials and Products grant program is to support the development, enhanced standardization\
  \ and transparency, and reporting criteria for environmental product declarations\
  \ (EPDs) which include the measurement of embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated\
  \ with all relevant stages of production, use, and disposal, in conformance with\
  \ international standards. In support of this goal, EPA will provide grants to businesses\
  \ that manufacture, remanufacture, and refurbish construction materials and products\
  \ for developing and verifying environmental product declarations, and to States,\
  \ Indian Tribes, and nonprofit organizations that will support such businesses.\
  \  \n\nUnder this program, EPA will award in FY25 up to 40 grants, some potentially\
  \ as \"pass-through\" grants to eligible entities.  Per the Code of Federal Regulations\
  \ (2 CFR 200.74), a pass-through entity is defined as a non-Federal entity that\
  \ provides a subaward to a subrecipient to carry out part of a federal program.\
  \  This grant program will lead to progress towards achieving the objectives of\
  \ Section 60112 of the Inflation Reduction Act."
