objective: The baseline tax system generally subjects capital gains to taxes the year
  that they are realized. However, the Tax Code allows a taxpayer who sells stock
  in a farm refiner to a farmersâ€™ cooperative to defer recognition of the gain if
  the proceeds are re-invested in a qualified replacement property.
