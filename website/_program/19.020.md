objective: To increase the number of minorities interested in and prepared for international
  service, particularly a Foreign Service career in the Department of State as well
  as provide students with a deeper appreciation of current issues and trends in international
  affairs, greater understanding of career opportunities in international affairs
  and the enhanced knowledge and skills to pursue such careers. The program develops
  a source of trained men and women, from academic fields representing the skill needs
  of the Department who are dedicated to representing America's interests abroad.
