- description: "Each of the three grantee organizations serves a unique geographic\
    \ region. Their accomplishments in each region are described below: \r\n\r\nRadio\
    \ Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL):   As of December 2009, RFE/RL broadcasts\
    \ in 28 languages to Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe; Russia; the Caucasus;\
    \ Central Asia; Iraq; Iran; and Afghanistan.  Eighteen of RFE/RL's broadcast languages\
    \ almost two-thirds of the total are directed to countries or regions where the\
    \ majority populations are Muslim. Each week, RFE/RL broadcasts more than 1,000\
    \ hours of radio programming and nearly five hours of television from its operations\
    \ center in Prague and from its 19 bureaus. During fiscal year 2009, RFE/RL's\
    \ 20 Internet websites reached a monthly average of over 2.1 million unique visitors,\
    \ logged nearly 4 million requests to listen to radio content online, and garnered\
    \ an average of 15.1 million page views each month reflecting increases of 13\
    \ percent, 18 percent, and 21 percent respectively over the previous year. \r\n\
    \r\nRFE/RL's proximity to its broadcast regions facilitates production of relevant,\
    \ locally-oriented programming in a cost-efficient manner. As of July 2009, RFE/RL\
    \ programs were available on 238 local AM, FM, UKV, and TV affiliates across its\
    \ broadcast region. RFE/RL is increasing delivery of its information products\
    \ on television, the Internet, and other emerging media in order to attract new\
    \ audiences and to reach closed and semi-closed societies. \r\n\r\nRadio Free\
    \ Asia (RFA):  RFA broadcasts in nine languages and four dialects to China (including\
    \ Tibet and the Xinjiang Region of Western China), Burma, Cambodia, Laos, North\
    \ Korea, and Vietnam, providing unbiased news to Asian countries that do not tolerate\
    \ a free press, and filling the news gap created by State-controlled media. Through\
    \ its network of reporters across Asia and its seven bureaus/offices, RFA frequently\
    \ leads the world in breaking news and continues to cover stories not reported\
    \ by other media. \r\n\r\nAs a multi-media news organization, RFA’s broadcasters\
    \ focus on developing vibrant, relevant content that meets the demands of its\
    \ radio audiences and drives visitors to its websites.  RFA material can be downloaded\
    \ to mobile devices, repackaged and republished to circumvent ever increasing\
    \ censorship, or shared b word-of-mouth.  \r\n\r\nMiddle East Broadcasting Network\
    \ (MBN):  MBN is a multimedia broadcasting organization.  Its brands currently\
    \ include Alhurra, Radio Sawa, and Afia Darfur. Alhurra operates three, 24/7 Arabic-language\
    \ news and information television channels – Alhurra, Alhurra-Iraq, and Alhurra\
    \ Europe. Radio Sawa broadcasts 24/7 on seven programming streams in the Middle\
    \ East, and utilizes Web sites as sources of up-to-the-minute news. MBN broadcasts\
    \ from its headquarters in Northern Virginia, with production outlets in Baghdad,\
    \ Cairo, Dubai, Beirut, and Jerusalem, and correspondents in the Middle East and\
    \ around the world.\r\n\r\nAlhurra is distributed digitally via Arabsat and Nilesat,\
    \ the same satellites used by all major Middle Eastern channels, as well as terrestrial\
    \ transmitters in Baghdad, Mosul, Basra, Tikrit and Al Hilla. Alhurra Europe is\
    \ distributed on Eutelsat Hotbird 8. Alhurra is also streamed on its news and\
    \ information website at www.alhurra.com.\r\n\r\nRadio Sawa can be heard throughout\
    \ the Middle East through FM and medium wave (AM) transmissions on seven streams\
    \ including: (1) Iraq (FM and AM); (2) Jordan and the West Bank (FM); (3) the\
    \ Gulf (FM and AM); (4) Egypt and the Levant (AM); (5) Morocco (FM); (6) Sudan,\
    \ Djibouti and Yemen (FM and AM); and (7) Lebanon and Syria (FM). Radio Sawa is\
    \ also streamed on its news and information Web site www.radiosawa.com.\r\n See\
