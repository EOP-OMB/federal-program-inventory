objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is\
  \ premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future\
  \ leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect\
  \ official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs inform,\
  \ engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society – including\
  \ young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals\
  \ – increasing the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience\
  \ with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule\
  \ of law, economic choice, and individual dignity, while building international\
  \ knowledge and capacity among Americans.  \r\n\r\nThe International Visitor Leadership\
  \ Program (IVLP) facilitates short-term visits to the United States for current\
  \ and emerging leaders from around the world to exchange best practices with American\
  \ counterparts in a broad range of professional fields directly tied to U.S. foreign\
  \ policy priorities.  Interagency staff at U.S. embassies worldwide nominate and\
  \ select participants in government, politics, business, education, the media, the\
  \ arts and other fields for the program; there is no application process.  Over\
  \ 500 alumni of the IVLP went on to become Chiefs of State or Heads of Government\
  \ in their countries.\r\n\r\nIVLP projects provide opportunities for participants\
  \ to explore issues in the U.S. context, meet with their American professional counterparts,\
  \ experience U.S. society, and understand American values.  Participants meet with\
  \ representatives of the private sector and civil society, as well as with government\
  \ officials at all levels.  The IVLP partners with a network of non-government,\
  \ non-profit organizations, including about 90 community-based organizations and\
  \ 40,000 volunteers across the country.  These “citizen diplomats” host the International\
  \ Visitors and share the American way of life by bringing them into their places\
  \ of work, schools, communities, and homes.  Americans, in turn, benefit from the\
  \ opportunity for first-hand, in-person exchange with current and emerging leaders\
  \ from around the world.  The IVLP broadens international understanding and supports\
  \ the local economy in both rural and urban communities throughout the United States.\
  \  Virtually the entire IVLP budget is spent within the United States in support\
  \ of program partners and local businesses."
