objective: 'To bring public health and epidemiologic principles together to identify,
  clarify, and reduce the impact of complex environmental threats, including terrorist
  threats and natural disasters, on populations, domestic and foreign.  These programs
  and activities focus on safeguarding the health of people from environmental threats;
  providing leadership in the use of environmental health sciences-including environmental
  epidemiology, environmental sanitation, and laboratory sciences-to protect public
  health; and responding to issues and sharing solutions to environmental health problems
  worldwide.  To accomplish the above, the CDC: (1) conducts surveillance and investigations
  that increase the knowledge about the relation between human health and environmental
  threats; (2) uses this knowledge to develop national public health programs and
  policies to prevent or control public health problems; (3) plans, prepares, and
  responds to emergencies, including terrorist threats, technologic accidents, and
  natural disasters; (4) provides direct service delivery to partners engaged in environmental
  health services such as food, safety, rodent control, water quality, and sanitation;
  (5) develops and applies laboratory science to prevent disease and death caused
  by exposure to environmental chemicals and to improve the diagnosis, treatment,
  and prevention of selected chronic diseases; (6) conducts Biomonitoring to assess
  individual human exposure to environmental chemicals by measuring them in human
  specimens (e.g. blood and urine); and, (7) conducts activities on emerging environmental
  threats such as climate change and the built environment.   '
