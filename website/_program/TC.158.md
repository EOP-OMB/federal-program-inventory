objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. Under current law, employers
  may establish associations, or VEBAs, to pay employee benefits, which may include
  health benefit plans, life insurance, and disability insurance, among other employee
  benefits. Investment income earned by such trusts is exempt from taxation.
