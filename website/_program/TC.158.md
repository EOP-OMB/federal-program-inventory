objective: Under the baseline tax system, neither the purchase of property nor insurance
  premiums to protect the property’s value are deductible as costs of earning income.
  Therefore, reimbursement for insured loss of such property is not included as a
  part of gross income, and uninsured losses are not deductible. In contrast, the
  Tax Code provides a deduction for uninsured casualty and theft losses of more than
  $100 each, to the extent that total losses during the year exceed 10 percent of
  the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. In the case of taxable years beginning after
  December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, personal casualty losses are deductible
  only to the extent they are attributable to a Federally declared disaster area.
