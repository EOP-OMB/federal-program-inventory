objective: Millions of low-income households experience difficulty paying for broadband
  service needed to participate in 21st Century society, including for work, education,
  healthcare, and civic engagement. Addressing affordability is a critical component
  of closing the digital divide. On November 15, 2021, Infrastructure Investment and
  Jobs Act (Infrastructure Act) was enacted, providing $14.2 billion for the Affordable
  Connectivity Program (ACP). The ACP plays an integral role in helping to bridge
  the digital divide, which is an ongoing top priority for Congress and the Federal
  Communications Commission (FCC). To date, a significant number of qualifying households
  have not yet enrolled in the ACP. Recognizing the importance of outreach to eligible
  households, Congress expressly authorized the FCC to conduct outreach to encourage
  households to enroll in the ACP, including providing grants to outreach partners.  The
  FCC establishes the Outreach Grant Program to provide eligible entities grant funds
  to conduct outreach in support of the ACP. Through this Outreach Grant Program,
  the FCC seeks to enlist partners around the country to help inform ACP-eligible
  households about the program in their local communities, and to provide those partners
  with the funding and resources needed to increase participation among those Americans
  most in need of affordable connectivity.
