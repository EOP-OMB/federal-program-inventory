objective: Treasury administers the Direct Component program and Centers of Excellence
  Research Grants Program. The primary objective of the Direct Component program is
  to provide funds to eligible entities for the ecological and economic restoration
  of the Gulf Coast Region. For the Centers of Excellence Research Grants Program,
  the primary objective is for the establishment of Centers of Excellence that focus
  on science, technology, and monitoring in one or more of the five eligible disciplines
  in the Gulf Coast States.

results:
- description: 'Using Direct Component funds, Santa Rosa County, FL, purchased an
    amphibious tracker to safely transport fire fighters to conduct mechanical treatments
    of over 325 acres in the Yellow River Marsh Preserve State Park. The results of
    the mechanical treatments will restore the area to a more natural environment
    condition, mitigate invasive plant species, and increase the resiliency of diverse
    habitats found within the park.


    Using Centers of Excellence Research Grant funds to mitigate significant pollution
    and future oil spills, Texas OneGulf is researching low cost, noiseless, and energy-efficient
    autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for offshore infrastructure monitoring and
    inspection with the introduction of robotic and artificial intelligent technologies.
    The development and testing of a bio-inspired robotic fish is resulting in a time-efficient
    and cost-effective intelligent robotic systems for underwater pipeline inspection.
    Pipeline anomalies due to seismic activity, offshore drilling, turbulence, and
    ship anchoring may be detected at early stages allowing operators to make informed
    decisions on maintenance and repairs of the pipeline. This research will inform
    subsea renewable energies and subsea mining.'
