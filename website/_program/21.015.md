objective: Treasury administers the Direct Component and Centers of Excellence Research
  Grants Programs. The primary objective of the Direct Component is to provide funds
  to eligible entities for the ecological and economic restoration of the Gulf Coast
  Region. For the Centers of Excellence Research Grants Program, the primary objective
  is for the establishment of Centers of Excellence that focus on science, technology,
  and monitoring in one or more of the five eligible disciplines in the Gulf Coast
  States.

  Programs
results:
- description: 'Using Direct Component funds, Pinellas County, FL, developed a public-facing
    Geographic Information System (GIS) decision support tool to present the impact
    of various future sea level rise (SLR) scenarios on critical infrastructure. Econometric
    models were created to estimate the cost benefits of different scenario-based
    outcomes and available options. The results of this assessment will facilitate
    effective decision-making, guide sustainable policies, and help prioritize efforts
    to ensure the long-term viability of the County''s coastal economy, infrastructure,
    and quality of life.


    Using Centers of Excellence Research Grants fund, the Louisiana-based Water Institute
    of the Gulf researched residents’ and public officials’ attitudes towards possible
    future relocation initiatives in the face of sea level rise, coastal erosion,
    and subsidence, in order to ensure an equity lens is used when developing effective
    programs that help people and communities on the frontline of environmental change
    move away from high-risk areas if and when they decide to move. Resident interviews
    illustrated how households are adapting, including how they make decisions about
    whether to stay or relocate, and the impediments to the widespread use of buyout
    and relocation programs. Interviews with local officials and community leaders
    focused on strategies to address coastal vulnerability as well as priority planning
    and policy interventions. Additionally, researchers analyzed buyout and relocation
    programs in the U.S. to identify useful lessons, promising practices, and pitfalls
    to avoid during the relocation process. The study’s findings will be used to develop
    recommendations to inform adaptation policy that moves beyond merely acquiring
    at-risk properties and leads to equitable outcomes for communities and residents
    on the front lines of the climate crisis. The report is available here:  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350833436_Beyond_Buyouts_Adaptive_Migration_and_the_Need_for_Equitable_Relocation_Strategies_Beyond_Buyouts_Adaptive_Migration_and_the_Need_for_Equitable_Relocation_Strategies'
