objective: The Equipment Grants Program (EGP) serves to increase access to shared-use
  special purpose equipment/instruments for fundamental and applied research for use
  in the food and agricultural sciences programs at institutions of higher education,
  including State Cooperative Extension Systems. The program seeks to strengthen the
  quality and expand the scope of fundamental and applied research at eligible institutions,
  by providing them with opportunities to acquire one shared-use piece of equipment/instrument
  that supports their research, research training, and extension goals and may be
  too costly and/or not appropriate for support through other NIFA grant programs.
  EGP grants are not intended to replace requests for equipment in individual project
  applications. The program emphasizes shared-use instrumentation that will enhance
  the capabilities of researchers, educators, and extension specialists both within
  and outside the proposing organization.
