objective: "Fostering EPA\u2019s partnership with the States and Tribes is critical\
  \ to accelerating environmental outcomes. Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs)\
  \ are the cornerstone of the National Environmental Performance Partnership System\
  \ (NEPPS), which aims to strengthen partnerships and build a results-based management\
  \ system. PPGs allow States and Tribes to combine eligible categorical State and\
  \ Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) into a single grant with a single budget. PPGs\
  \ can reduce administrative transaction costs, provide flexibility to direct resources\
  \ toward environmental priorities, and support cross-media approaches and initiatives.\
  \ EPA's overarching goal is to optimize the leveraging power of PPGs to focus strategically\
  \ on the joint priorities of EPA, States, and Tribes. The Agency supports the goals\
  \ of NEPPS and Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs) which serve to: (1) strengthen\
  \ partnerships between EPA, the States, Tribes and interstate agencies through joint\
  \ planning, priority setting, and efficient and effective management of federal-state\
  \ resources; (2) provide States, Tribes, and interstate agencies with flexibility\
  \ to direct resources where they are needed to address environmental and public\
  \ health priorities; (3) link program activities more effectively with environmental\
  \ and public health goals and environmental outcomes; (4) foster implementation\
  \ of innovative approaches such as pollution prevention, ecosystem management, and\
  \ community-based environmental protection strategies; and (5) provide savings by\
  \ streamlining administrative requirements.  For a current list of grant programs\
  \ eligible for inclusion in a PPG, please visit www.epa.gov/NEPPS."
