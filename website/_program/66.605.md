objective: "Fostering EPA’s partnership with the states and Tribes is critical to\
  \ accelerating environmental outcomes. Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs) are\
  \ the cornerstone of the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS),\
  \ which aims to strengthen partnerships and build a results-based management system.\
  \ PPGs allow states and Tribes to combine eligible categorical State and Tribal\
  \ Assistance Grants (STAG) into a single grant with a single budget. PPGs can reduce\
  \ administrative transaction costs, provide flexibility to direct resources toward\
  \ environmental priorities, and support cross-media approaches and initiatives.\
  \ EPA's overarching goal is to optimize the leveraging power of PPGs to focus strategically\
  \ on the joint priorities of EPA and recipients. \n The Agency supports the goals\
  \ of NEPPS and Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs) which serve to: (1) strengthen\
  \ partnerships between EPA and recipients through joint planning, priority setting,\
  \ and efficient and effective management of resources; (2) provide states, Tribes,\
  \ and interstate agencies with flexibility to direct resources where they are needed\
  \ to address environmental and public health priorities; (3) link program activities\
  \ more effectively with environmental and public health goals and environmental\
  \ outcomes; (4) foster implementation of innovative approaches such as pollution\
  \ prevention, ecosystem management, and community-based environmental protection\
  \ strategies; and (5) provide savings by streamlining administrative requirements.\

- description: No content available.  hese grants fund state and tribal pesticide
    programs that are part of a Performance Partnership Agreement, known as a PPG
    or a PPA. As EPA’s co-regulators, these pesticide programs work extensively with
    pesticide applicators, growers, commodity groups, as well as other government
    agencies to promote the proper use of pesticides and address pesticide issues.
    These programs conduct extensive technical assistance for all stakeholders as
    well as the general public, and provide outreach and education on EPA’s national
    pesticide priorities such as worker protection, pollinator protection and emerging
    public health pesticide issues. If enforcement funds are included, these funds
    are used to enforce FIFRA. https://www.cfda.gov/index?s=program&mode=form&tab=step1&id=369fc5eda1e44e7dd8002f175c10809d

- description: PPGs have allowed States to take advantage of administrative and program
    efficiencies and innovations to achieve greater environmental and program results.
    States and Tribes have used PPGs to address critical emergencies and unplanned
    events and have used PPG flexibility to overcome periodic budget needs or high
    program demands in specific programs. States and Tribes have used PPGs to implement
    multi-program initiatives and innovations that impact many environmental programs.
    They also have taken advantage of streamlined administrative procedures to make
    grant processes more efficient. PPGs have allowed Tribes to develop and implement
    environmental programs in situations where it would have been more difficult using
    categorical grants.
