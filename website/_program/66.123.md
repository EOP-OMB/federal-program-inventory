objective: "Puget Sound has been designated as one of 28 estuaries of National Significance\
  \ under section 320 of the Clean Water Act. The goal of the National Estuary Program\
  \ is to attain and maintain water quality in designated estuaries that will assure\
  \ protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced,\
  \ indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife and allows recreational\
  \ activities in and on the water. The Puget Sound National Estuary Program's approved\
  \ Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP), the Action Agenda, has\
  \ a goal to restore and maintain the Puget Sound Estuary's environment by meeting\
  \ 2022-2026 ecosystem targets. The Action Agenda for Puget Sound charts the course\
  \ to recovery of our nation's largest estuary\u2013it complements and incorporates\
  \ the work of many partners from around Puget Sound to describe regional strategies\
  \ and specific actions needed to recover Puget Sound. These strategies and actions\
  \ provide opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal, and private entities\
  \ to better invest resources and coordinate actions. The EPA is committed to protecting\
  \ and improving water quality and minimizing the adverse impacts of rapid development\
  \ in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments include protecting the watersheds\
  \ and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the fundamental watershed processes that\
  \ provide and create aquatic habitats and by reducing the generation and release\
  \ of toxic, nutrient and pathogen pollution. This program has the following main\
  \ objectives: First, implementing the approved CCMP, the Action Agenda for Puget\
  \ Sound, is the primary objective of this program. Funds are directed to the highest\
  \ priority work as articulated in every four-year updates to the Action Agenda work\
  \ plan. The updated work plan identifies implementation strategies to achieve reductions\
  \ in the harmful impacts on Puget Sound and restore previously damaged aquatic ecosystem\
  \ functions. A central component of the approved CCMP for Puget Sound is its Science\
  \ Work Plan which identifies some of the core scientific work that must be completed\
  \ in order for Action Agenda implementation efforts to succeed. This program is\
  \ to support implementation of priority near term actions and to support the technical\
  \ studies and investigations that are needed to help direct implementation priorities\
  \ and help support the tracking systems and evaluation approaches for implementation\
  \ activities. Together with projects aimed at achievement of specific environmental\
  \ outcomes, the science studies and technical investigations inform adaptive management\
  \ of the program significantly contributing to the restoration and protection of\
  \ Puget Sound. The program has considered relevant approaches to achieving the intended\
  \ goals and objectives of the program consistent with statutory requirements, including\
  \ priorities in Executive Order 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment\
  \ and Jobs Act), to invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor\
  \ stands, ensure goods and services are made in America, and build infrastructure\
  \ that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using IIJA funds. Funding\
  \ Priorities - Fiscal Year 2021-2026 : Funding will be continued for the three strategic\
  \ initiative leads (SILs) which will  focus on: Award and manage subawards to support\
  \ the implementation of the Action Agenda with a focus on Implementation Strategies;\
  \ maintain Strategic Initiative Advisory Teams (SIATs) to advise in investment-related\
  \ decision-making; serve as Implementation Strategy Leads for Vital Signs related\
  \ to the Strategic Initiative and form technical (e.g., Interdisciplinary Teams)\
  \ and/or policy workgroups to develop, refine, adaptively manage, and operationalize\
  \ Implementation Strategies; participate in the Puget Sound Partnership and National\
  \ Estuary Program (NEP) Management Conference processes and work groups; and proactively\
  \ coordinate with tribal partners and Local Integrating Organizations (LIOs) in\
  \ order to accomplish SIL work. New lead programs have been created with Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding.  In FY23 two new Request for Applications\
  \ were issued for one lead organization for Climate Resilient Riparian Systems and\
  \ the other for Ensuring Environmental Justice, Human Wellbeing and Ecosystem Recovery\
  \ in Puget Sound."
