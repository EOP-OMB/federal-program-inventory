objective: "The purpose of the FARAD is to provide livestock producers, extension\
  \ specialists, scientists, and veterinarians with up to date information to prevent\
  \ drug, pesticide and environmental contaminant residues in food animal products.\r\
  \n\r\nCollaboration between all institutions occurs on research projects that are\
  \ necessary to validate the FARAD withdrawal interval estimates."

- description: "This represents a newly created Assistance Listing (CFDA) number,\
    \ which was part of an initiative to break out the separate programs formerly\
    \ contained in CFDA # 10.500 – Cooperative Extension Service (CES). \n\nFor the\
    \ Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 award cycle, Congress appropriated $2.5 million and $2.4\
    \ million was available to support FARAD, which was funded under its own line\
    \ item authority.\n\nFive (5) applications are being reviewed and evaluated under\
    \ competition waiver administrative processes.  FARAD applications are merit-reviewed\
    \ internally by National Program Staff and all five (5) entities will be funded.\
    \   This is the second year that this program will have five participating institutions.\
    \ \n\nThis 33-year-old high performing integrated consortium of collaborating\
    \ institutions currently includes at each Land Grant campus a lead Project Director\
    \ (PD), and his/her respective scientific staff.  \n\t\nThe funding ratio for\
    \ this program in FY 2018 will be 100% due to the competition waiver process.\n\
    \nFARAD is a university-based national program that serves as the nation’s primary\
    \ source for scientifically-based recommendations regarding safe withdrawal intervals\
    \ of drugs (used off label) and chemicals in food-producing animals. As such,\
    \ FARAD is a key resource for protection of our nation's food supply, including\
    \ meat, milk and eggs, against accidental contamination of animal-derived foods\
    \ with residues of drugs, pesticides or other agents that could compromise food\
    \ safety."
  year: '2019'
- description: No major shifts of responsibilities among the five (5) collaborating
    Universities is projected.  Each network node is expected to continue to effectively
    accomplish its site-specific scientific and communication tasks and provide 24/7
    expert-mediated hotline and internet-accessible data and services in support of
    the overall integrated network mission.
  year: '2020'
