  \ Allies, hereafter referred to as the Consolidated Youth Program,  supports activities\
  \ that were previously funded under the following four OVW grant programs: Children\

  \ Program (Youth Services); Services, Training, Education and Policies to Reduce\
  \ Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking in Secondary\
  \ Schools Grant Program (STEP); and Engaging Men in Preventing Sexual Assault, Domestic\
  \ Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking Program (Engaging Men). \r\n\r\nThe Consolidated\

  \ among non-profit victim services, violence prevention and children and youth-serving\
  \ organizations, organizations and programs that support men\u2019s role in combating\
  \ violence against women and girls, schools, and tribal and local government agencies.\
  \   This program has two primary purposes and supports projects that implement one\
  \ or both of these areas.  First, the program supports comprehensive child- and\
  \ youth-centered intervention and prevention programs that maximize  community based\
  \ efforts and evidence-informed practices to more fully address domestic violence,\
  \ dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. Comprehensive programs include victim\
  \ services to youth and children exposed to violence; training to professionals\
  \ to improve interventions and responses; coordinated school based strategies; supportive\
  \ services to non-offending parents; and coordinated community responses to violence\
  \ targeting children and youth.  Second, the program supports multi-faceted prevention\
  \ strategies that involve community organizing, outreach, public education and mobilization\
  \ that utilize men as influencers of other men and boys and encourages them to work\
  \ as allies with women and girls to prevent domestic violence, dating violence,\
  \ sexual assault and stalking.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
