objective: "The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the primary federal funding\
  \ source to help certain families with low incomes access child care and to improve\
  \ the quality of child care for all children. As a block grant, CCDF gives funding\
  \ to States, Territories, and Tribes to provide child care subsidies primarily through\
  \ vouchers or certificates to families with low income. In addition, CCDF funds\
  \ are used to improve the quality of child care for both subsidized and unsubsidized\
  \ children. CCDF consists of both Discretionary funding authorized by the Child\
  \ Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act and Mandatory and Matching funding\
  \ under the Social Security Act. \nIn addition to the block grants to States, Territories\
  \ and Tribes, a small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to\
  \ provide technical assistance to lead agencies on administering the program.  A\
  \ small portion of CCDF is also used for child care research, demonstration and\
  \ evaluation, and federal administration activities."
