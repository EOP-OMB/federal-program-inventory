objective: "The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the primary federal funding\
  \ source to help certain low-income families access child care and to improve the\
  \ quality of child care for all children. As a block grant, CCDF gives funding to\
  \ States, Territories, and Tribes to provide child care subsidies primarily through\
  \ vouchers or certificates to low-income families. In addition, CCDF funds are used\
  \ to improve the quality of child care for both subsidized and unsubsidized children.\
  \ CCDF consists of both Discretionary funding authorized by the Child Care and Development\
  \ Block Grant (CCDBG) Act and Mandatory and Matching funding under the Social Security\
  \ Act. \nThe CCDBG was created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990\
  \ (P.L. 101-508) and is subject to annual appropriations. The Personal Responsibility\
  \ and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) consolidated\
  \ funding for child care under the Social Security Act, where CCDF mandatory and\
  \ matching funding is authorized, and made such funding generally subject to the\
  \ requirements of the CCDBG Act. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act\
  \ of 2014 (P.L. 113-186) reauthorized the discretionary portion of CCDF through\
  \ FY 2020 and made significant changes to improve the health, safety, and quality\
  \ of child care and provide more continuous child care assistance to low-income\
  \ children and families. In addition to the block grants to States, Territories\
  \ and Tribes, a small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to\
  \ provide technical assistance to lead agencies on administering the program.  A\
  \ small portion of CCDF is also used for child care research, demonstration and\
  \ evaluation activities.  The Discretionary portion of the CCDF funds provides about\
  \ $7.9 billion in federal funding per year for child care. Additional funding is\
  \ provided by state matching and maintenance of effort funds, as well as funds transferred\
  \ from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.  Requirements\
  \ for competitive grants including research grants vary and can be found in the\
  \ Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs). There was an increase in mandatory and\
  \ matching funding for CCDF, which is a permanent annual appropriation and is detailed\
  \ in Assistance Listing 93.596."
