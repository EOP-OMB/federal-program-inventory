objective: "The Inflation Reduction Act amends the Clean Air Act to include Section\
  \ 134 (42 USC \xA7 7434), which authorizes the EPA to make competitive grants under\
  \ the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator. The Clean Communities Investment\
  \ Accelerator is currently funded by $6 billion from Section 134(a)(3) (out of $8\
  \ billion provided in Section 134(a)(3)). The Clean Communities Investment Accelerator\
  \ implements the statute\u2019s use of funds for indirect investments under Section\
  \ 134(b)(2). Section 134(b)(2) directs recipients of funds for indirect investments\
  \ to provide funding and technical assistance to establish new or support existing\
  \ public, quasi-public, not-for-profit, or nonprofit entities that provide financial\
  \ assistance to qualified projects at the State, local, territorial, or Tribal level\
  \ or in the District of Columbia, including community- and low-income-focused lenders\
  \ and capital providers. Section 134(c)(3) provides that a qualified project is\
  \ any project, activity or technology that (A) reduces or avoids greenhouse gas\
  \ emissions or other forms of air pollution in partnership with, and by leveraging\
  \ investment from, the private sector; or (B) assists communities in the efforts\
  \ of those communities to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms\
  \ of air pollution."
