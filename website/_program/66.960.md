objective: The Inflation Reduction Act amends the Clean Air Act to include Section
  134 (42 USC § 7434), which authorizes the EPA to make competitive grants under the
  Clean Communities Investment Accelerator. The Clean Communities Investment Accelerator
  is currently funded by $6 billion from Section 134(a)(3) (out of $8 billion provided
  in Section 134(a)(3)). The Clean Communities Investment Accelerator implements the
  statute’s use of funds for indirect investments under Section 134(b)(2). Section
  134(b)(2) directs recipients of funds for indirect investments to provide funding
  and technical assistance to establish new or support existing public, quasi-public,
  not-for-profit, or nonprofit entities that provide financial assistance to qualified
  projects at the State, local, territorial, or Tribal level or in the District of
  Columbia, including community- and low-income-focused lenders and capital providers.
  Section 134(c)(3) provides that a qualified project is any project, activity or
  technology that (A) reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions or other forms of
  air pollution in partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private
  sector; or (B) assists communities in the efforts of those communities to reduce
  or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.
