objective: "This program links Federal Motor Carrier Safety information systems with\
  \ State commercial vehicle registration systems and enables a State to (1) determine\
  \ the safety fitness of a motor carrier or registrant when applying for registration\
  \ or while the registration is in effect; and (2) deny, suspend, or revoke the registration\
  \ of a motor carrier or registrant that has been issued an Out-of-Service (OOS)\
  \ order by the FMCSA. \n\nThe PRISM grant program has been consolidated into the\
  \ Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) and High Priority grant programs\
  \ due to changes in FMCSA\u2019s authorization under the Fixing America\u2019s Surface\
  \ Transportation Act (Pub. L. No. \xA7 114-94, \xA7\xA7 5101(a) and 5101(c) (2015),\
  \ 49 U.S.C. \xA7\xA7 31102(a)-(k), 31104 (2016), as amended). Awards are no longer\
  \ being made under this CFDA; however, pre-existing grants will remain active until\
  \ project completion and/or period of performance on the individual grant agreements\
  \ expire. For more information on these changes, visit FMCSA CFDA number 20.218."
