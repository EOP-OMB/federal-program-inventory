objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities
  or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code provides an EITC to low-income
  workers at a maximum rate of 45 percent of income. In 2024, for a family with one
  qualifying child, the credit is 34 percent of the first $12,390 of earned income.
  The credit is 40 percent of the first $17,400 of income for a family with two qualifying
  children, and it is 45 percent of the first $17,400 of income for a family with
  three or more qualifying children. Low-income workers with no qualifying children
  are eligible for a 7.65 percent credit on the first $8,260 of earned income. The
  credit plateaus and then phases out with the greater of Adjusted Gross Income or
  earnings at income levels and rates which depend upon how many qualifying children
  are eligible and marital status. Earned income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities
  are refundable to individuals. Beginning in 2018, the parameters of the EITC are
  indexed by the chained CPI, which results in a smaller inflation adjustment than
  previously.
