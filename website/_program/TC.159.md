objective: 'Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In addition, investment
  income would be taxed as earned. In contrast, employer-paid contributions (the value
  of stock issued to the ESOP) are deductible by the employer as part of employee
  compensation costs. They are not included in the employeesâ€™ gross income for tax
  purposes, however, until they are paid out as benefits. In addition, the following
  special income tax provisions for ESOPs are intended to increase ownership of corporations
  by their employees: (1) annual employer contributions are subject to less restrictive
  limitations than other qualified retirement plans; (2) ESOPs may borrow to purchase
  employer stock, guaranteed by their agreement with the employer that the debt will
  be serviced by the payment (deductible by firm) of a portion of wages (excludable
  by the employees) to service the loan; (3) employees who sell appreciated company
  stock to the ESOP may defer any taxes due until they withdraw benefits; (4) dividends
  paid to ESOP-held stock are deductible by the employer; and (5) earnings are not
  taxed as they accrue.'
