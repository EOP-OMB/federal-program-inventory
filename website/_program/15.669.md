objective: The Collaborative Landscape Conservation program promotes an inclusive
  approach to conservation by convening and facilitating diverse partnerships to address
  shared conservation challenges and create a network of healthy lands and waters
  where fish, wildlife, plants, and people thrive. The program advances adaptive leadership
  in landscape conservation regionally and nationally by identifying shared priorities
  with states, tribes, private landowners, academic institutions, and non-governmental
  organizations (NGOs) coordinating actions, and informing decision-making. We support
  research to improve strategic conservation at the landscape scale, including development
  of data-driven decision support capability that make collaborative conservation
  achievable and support resilient landscape design which considers wildlife and ecosystems
  as well as cultural, social, and economic priorities. We support building collaborative
  conservation and the co-production of science by increasing capacity and support
  to effectively engage partners, synthesize information, and produce strategic approaches
  for landscape conservation.
