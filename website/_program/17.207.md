    Job Center service delivery system.  It provides universal access to its services
    to both job seekers and businesses.  Services are provided in three modes: self
    and information-only service, basic career service, and individualized career
    service.

    more than 3,599,000 participants.  Of those, 3,072,000 were unemployed at the
    start of participation, and more than 629,000 were low income individuals.  After
    exiting the program, 68.6 percent of WP-/ES exiters were employed two quarters
    after exit.  Exiters who were employed had a median earnings of $6,519 in the
