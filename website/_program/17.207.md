objective: The Employment Service (ES) program brings together individuals looking
  for employment and employers looking for job seekers.  It does this by providing
  a variety of services, which are available to all individuals.  The program provides
  job seekers with career services, including labor exchange services, job search
  assistance, workforce information, referrals to employment, and other assistance.  Employers
  can use the ES to post job orders and obtain qualified applicants.
