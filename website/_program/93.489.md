objective: "The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (P.L. 117-328) provided $100\
  \ million in supplemental Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) funding for necessary\
  \ expenses directly related to Hurricanes Fiona and Ian. Disaster relief funds will\
  \ be awarded to eligible State, Territory, and Tribal Lead Agencies for child care\
  \ expenses directly related to Hurricanes Fiona and Ian, including activities authorized\
  \ under section 319(a) of the Public Health Service Act, occurring in calendar year\
  \ 2022. \nThe Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is required to distribute\
  \ funding to the eligible states, territory, and tribes based on assessed need,\
  \ notwithstanding the formula for allotment set forth in the Child Care and Development\
  \ Block Grant (CCDBG) Act. The funds will be awarded in two phases. In phase one,\
  \ $10 million has been set aside for eligible CCDF lead agencies to undertake a\
  \ process of planning for implementation of activities. In phase two, approximately\
  \ $90 million will be available for implementation of disaster recovery plans developed\
  \ in phase one, with additional guidance and application instructions for phase\
  \ two funding to be issued in FY 2024.\nEligible lead agencies may initially request\
  \ funds in phase one to support their planning of a larger request with funding\
  \ available in phase two.\nFederal interest provisions do not apply to the renovation\
  \ or rebuilding of privately-owned family child care homes. Funds are not available\
  \ for costs that are reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or under\
  \ a contract for insurance, or by self-insurance. Provisions related to the CCDF\
  \ allocation formula did not apply to the use of these funds."
