objective: "Hurricanes Fiona and Ian were powerful storms that impacted several states,\
  \ Tribal Nations with in those states, and Puerto Rico. In response, Congress provided\
  \ $100 million in supplemental Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) funding for\
  \ those jurisdictions to address the impacts of the hurricanes on child care programs\
  \ and services. The funds will be awarded in two phases. In phase one, $10 million\
  \ was awarded in FY 2023 for eligible CCDF lead agencies to undertake a process\
  \ of planning for implementation of activities. In phase two, $88 million was awarded\
  \ in FY 2024 for implementation of disaster recovery plans developed in phase one,\
  \ which could include construction and renovation of child care facilities and the\
  \ purchase of existing facilities in areas impacted by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian.\
  \ ACF shall not retain Federal interest after a period of 10 years in any facility\
  \ renovated, repaired, or rebuilt with these funds.  \nFederal interest provisions\
  \ do not apply to the renovation or rebuilding of privately-owned family child care\
  \ homes. In addition, to funding available for lead agencies, $2 million was reserved\
  \ for federal administration and assistance."
