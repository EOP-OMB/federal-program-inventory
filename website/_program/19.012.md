objective: As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and
  Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people
  of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and
  cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals,
  students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage dialogue
  with citizens around the world.  Educational and cultural engagement is premised
  on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future leaders, and
  the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making
  almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs inform, engage, and influence
  participants across strategic sectors of society – including youth, women, teachers,
  scholars, artists, technical experts, journalists, and other professionals – increasing
  the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience with Americans
  and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic
  choice, and individual dignity, while building international knowledge among Americans.  The
  purpose of the Special Professional and Cultural Programs is to carry out Congressionally-directed
  initiatives that support professional exchanges between the United States and select
  countries through grants to American non-profit, non-governmental institutions and
  organizations, including community organizations, professional associations, and
  universities.
