objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world.  Educational and cultural engagement\
  \ is premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future\
  \ leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect\
  \ official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs inform,\
  \ engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society \u2013\
  \ including youth, women, teachers, scholars, artists, technical experts, journalists,\
  \ and other professionals \u2013 increasing the number of foreign individuals who\
  \ have first-hand experience with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative\
  \ government, rule of law, economic choice, and individual dignity, while building\
  \ international knowledge among Americans.  The purpose of the Special Professional\
  \ and Cultural Programs is to carry out Congressionally-directed initiatives that\
  \ support professional exchanges between the United States and select countries\
  \ through grants to American non-profit, non-governmental institutions and organizations,\
  \ including community organizations, professional associations, and universities."
