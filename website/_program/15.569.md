- description: 'The foundation hosted the 2023 Water Summit for 124 participants on
    October 25, 2023. The 38th Water Summit featured top policymakers and leading
    experts who provided the latest information and viewpoints on issues affecting
    water across California and the West, focusing on the theme Rethinking Water in
    the West. Seven of eight Project Water Education for Teachers (WET) K-12 educator
    professional development workshops were conducted within the Bay Delta Watershed
    and CVPIA Service Area. Training organization and outreach was supported by Reclamation
    funding for Project WET. Project WET workshops help K-12 educators integrate concepts
    and skills directly related to studying and managing the Bay-Delta, its watershed,
    and the CVPIA service area using state Common Core and Next Generation Science
    Standards. The 104 educators who attended these Project WET workshops said that
    they would apply these activities with approximately 32,279 students in the current
    and upcoming 2023-2024 school year. The foundation hosted the Northern California
    Water Tour 2023 which explored the Sacramento River and its tributaries through
    scenic landscape while learning about this key source for the state’s water supply.
    The foundation also hosted the San Joaquin River Restoration Tour which traveled
    along the San Joaquin River to learn firsthand about one of the nation’s largest
    and most expensive river restoration projects. The foundation also hosted a Project
    WET Water Tour which was a one-day tour on October 1 to help expand Project WET
    educators’ knowledge about the role that water management partners play within
    the Bay-Delta watershed and Central Valley Project Improvement Act service area.
    The foundation provided a Delta Explainer and Interactive Map tour which was an
    interactive online tour of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to offer viewers and
    readers a broad overview of the heart of California water – its history and development,
    its importance as an ecological resource and water hub and the array of challenges
    it faces.
