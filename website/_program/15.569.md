- description: "The foundation hosted the 2022 Water Summit for 124 participants on\
    \ October 27, 2022. The 38th Water Summit featured top policymakers and leading\
    \ experts who provided the latest information and viewpoints on issues affecting\
    \ water across California and the West, focusing on the theme Rethinking Water\
    \ in the West.\n\nSeven of eight Project Water Education for Teachers (WET) K-12\
    \ educator professional development workshops were conducted within the Bay Delta\
    \ Watershed and CVPIA Service Area. Training organization and outreach was supported\
    \ by Reclamation funding for Project WET. Project WET workshops help K-12 educators\
    \ integrate concepts and skills directly related to studying and managing the\
    \ Bay-Delta, its watershed, and the CVPIA service area using state Common Core\
    \ and Next Generation Science Standards. The 104 educators who attended these\
    \ Project WET workshops said that they would apply these activities with approximately\
    \ 32,279 students in the current and upcoming 2022-2023 school year.\n\nThe foundation\
    \ hosted the Northern California Water Tour 2022 which explored the Sacramento\
    \ River and its tributaries through scenic landscape while learning about this\
    \ key source for the state\u2019s water supply. The foundation also hosted the\
    \ San Joaquin River Restoration Tour which traveled along the San Joaquin River\
    \ to learn firsthand about one of the nation\u2019s largest and most expensive\
    \ river restoration projects. The foundation also hosted a Project WET Water Tour\
    \ which was a one-day tour on October 1 to help expand Project WET educators\u2019\
    \ knowledge about the role that water management partners play within the Bay-Delta\
    \ watershed and Central Valley Project Improvement Act service area.\n\nThe foundation\
    \ provided a Delta Explainer and Interactive Map tour which was an interactive\
    \ online tour of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to offer viewers and readers\
    \ a broad overview of the heart of California water \u2013 its history and development,\
    \ its importance as an ecological resource and water hub and the array of challenges\
    \ it faces."
