  Announcement
results:
- description: "Reviews of CCPI-3 applications were completed and projects were selected.\
    \  Selection and award of Major Demonstration projects significantly expands the\
    \ opportunities to demonstrate CCS at commercial scale in geologic formation.\
    \ All $796 million in Recovery Act Funding allocated for CCPI-3 was awarded to\
    \ four CCPI-3 projects.  These projects were awarded to Hydrogen Energy California\
    \ LLC (HECA) on August 30, 2009, American Electric Power Service Corporation (AEP)\
    \ and Summit Texas Clean Energy LLC (STCE) on January 20, 2010, and NRG Energy\
    \ Inc. on May 7, 2010. 57 jobs have been created thus far.\r\n\r\nGoals: Projects\
    \ demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies that will capture and sequester\
    \ or put to beneficial use carbon emissions.   The selections demonstrate technologies\
    \ that make progress toward a target CO2 capture efficiency of 90%; make progress\
    \ toward a capture and sequestration goal of less than 10% increase in the cost\
    \ of electricity for gasification systems and less than 35% for combustion and\
    \ oxycombustion systems; and capture and sequester or put to beneficial use an\
    \ amount of CO2 emissions in excess of the minimum of 300,000 tons per year required\
    \ by CCPI.\r\n"
