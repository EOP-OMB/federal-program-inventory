objective: 'To aid: (1) Families for whom the lack of adequate housing is a primary
  factor in: a. The imminent placement of the family’s child or children in out-of-home
  care, or b. The delay in the discharge of the child or children to the family from
  out-of-home care. (2) For a period not to exceed 36 months, otherwise eligible youths
  who have attained at least 18 years and not more than 24 years of age and who have
  left foster care, or will leave foster care within 90 days, in accordance with a
  transition plan described in section 475(5)(H) of the Social Security Act and is
  homeless or is at risk of becoming homeless at age 16 or older. FUP- eligible families
  and youths may use these Housing Choice Vouchers (HVCs) to obtain decent, safe,
  and affordable housing units in the private rental market. Where appropriations
  provide for FUP assistance to be targeted to FUP-eligible youth only, HUD uses the
  name Foster Youth to Independence to create a distinction between regular FUP allocations
  and allocations targeted to FUP-eligible youth only.'
