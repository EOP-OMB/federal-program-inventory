  \ factor in: a. The imminent placement of the family\u2019s child or children in\
  \ out-of-home care, or b. The delay in the discharge of the child or children to\
  \ the family from out-of-home care. (2) For a period not to exceed 36 months, otherwise\
  \ eligible youths who have attained at least 18 years and not more than 24 years\
  \ of age and who have left foster care, or will leave foster care within 90 days,\
  \ in accordance with a transition plan described in section 475(5)(H) of the Social\
  \ Security Act and is homeless or is at risk of becoming homeless at age 16 or older.\
  \ FUP- eligible families and youths may use these Housing Choice Vouchers (HVCs)\
  \ to obtain decent, safe, and affordable housing units in the private rental market.\
  \ Where appropriations provide for FUP assistance to be targeted to FUP-eligible\
  \ youth only, HUD uses the name Foster Youth to Independence to create a distinction\
  \ between regular FUP allocations and allocations targeted to FUP-eligible youth\
  \ only."
