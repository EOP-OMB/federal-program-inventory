objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code provides employers
  with a tax credit for qualified wages paid to employees who are enrolled members
  of Indian tribes. The amount of the credit that could be claimed is 20 percent of
  the excess of qualified wages and health insurance costs paid by the employer in
  the current tax year over the amount of such wages and costs paid by the employer
  in 1993. Qualified wages and health insurance costs with respect to any employee
  for the taxable year could not exceed $20,000. Employees have to live on or near
  the reservation where they work to be eligible for the credit. Employers must reduce
  their deduction for wages paid by the amount of the credit claimed. The credit does
  not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.
