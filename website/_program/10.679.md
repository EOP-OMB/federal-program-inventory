  of small diameter trees on Federal, Tribal, State, County, and Municipal forest
  lands; to improve communication and joint problem solving among individuals and
  groups who are interested in restoring the diversity and productivity of forested
  watersheds in New Mexico; to improve the use of, or add value to, small diameter
  trees; to encourage sustainable communities and sustainable forests through collaborative
  partnerships, whose objectives are forest restoration; and to develop, demonstrate,
  and evaluate ecologically sound forest restoration techniques.'
