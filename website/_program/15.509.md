  loads; (3) install conversation practices to reduce salinity levels; (4) carry out
  research, education, and demonstration activities; (5) carry out monitoring and
  devaluation activities; and (6) to decrease salt concentration and salt loading
  which causes increased salinity levels within the Colorado River and to enhance
