objective: Scholarships and fellowships are excluded from taxable income to the extent
  they pay for tuition and course-related expenses of the grantee. Similarly, tuition
  reductions for employees of educational institutions and their families are not
  included in taxable income. From an economic point of view, scholarships and fellowships
  are either gifts not conditioned on the performance of services, or they are rebates
  of educational costs. Thus, under the baseline tax system of the reference tax law
  method, this exclusion is not a tax expenditure because this method does not include
  either gifts or price reductions in a taxpayerâ€™s gross income. The exclusion, however,
  is considered a tax expenditure under the normal tax method, which includes gift-like
  transfers of Government funds in gross income. (Many scholarships are derived directly
  or indirectly from Government funding.)
