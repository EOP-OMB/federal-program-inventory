objective: "The Wildlife Program fulfills the Department of the Interior visions of\
  \ improving the management of wildlife and their habitats, and upholding trust and\
  \ related responsibilities. The Wildlife Program is responsible for administering\
  \ program activities that support maintaining functioning wildlife habitats, developing,\
  \ and implementing restoration projects, and the inventory and monitoring of priority\
  \ habitats and species to track trends and use on public lands.  BLM-managed lands\
  \ are vital to thousands of species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and\
  \ invertebrates. To provide for the long-term conservation of wildlife and biodiversity\
  \ on public lands, the Wildlife Program uses a science-based approach to manage\
  \ public lands to identify projects that support meeting land health standards and\
  \ desired resource objectives for priority species and habitats, as outlined in\
  \ land use plans. The program is focused on addressing habitat connectivity issues\
  \ and implementing projects that consider climate change impacts to short- and long-term\
  \ objectives.      \n\nThe Wildlife Program uses a multi-scale approach that involves\
  \ coordination with BLM offices and other programs; Federal, state, and tribal governments;\
  \ and non-governmental partners to accomplish projects and coordinated management\
  \ at appropriate scales. The BLM\u2019s primary partners in wildlife habitat conservation\
  \ include the respective state fish and wildlife agencies, tribal governments, and\
  \ the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Wildlife Program also collaborates with\
  \ other agencies and numerous conservation partners to leverage resources and maximize\
  \ the benefits for wildlife habitat. The BLM uses the latest geospatial data technologies\
  \ to share wildlife and wildlife data within BLM and with partners to work more\
  \ efficiently. This program will fund projects under the Infrastructure Investment\
  \ and Jobs Act PL 117-58, Section 40804(b) Ecosystem Restoration."
