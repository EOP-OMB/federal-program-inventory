objective: The Wildlife Program fulfills the Department of the Interior visions of
  improving the management of wildlife and their habitats. , The Wildlife Program
  is responsible for administering program activities that support maintaining functioning
  wildlife habitats, developing, and implementing restoration projects, and the inventory
  and monitoring of priority habitats and species to track trends and uses on public
  lands. BLM-managed lands are vital to thousands of species of mammals, birds, reptiles,
  amphibians, and invertebrates. To provide for the long-term conservation of wildlife
  and biodiversity on public lands, the Wildlife Program uses a science-based approach
  to manage public lands to identify projects that support meeting land health standards
  and desired resource objectives for priority species and habitats, as outlined in
  land use plans. The program is focused on addressing habitat connectivity, big game
  migrations, water availability issues and implementing projects that consider climate
  change impacts to short- and long-term objectives. The Wildlife Program uses a multi-scale
  approach that involves coordination with BLM offices and other programs; Federal,
  state, and tribal governments; and non-governmental partners to accomplish projects
  and coordinated management at appropriate scales. The BLM's primary partners in
  wildlife habitat conservation include the respective State Fish and Wildlife Agencies,
  Tribal governments, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Wildlife Program
  also collaborates with other agencies and numerous conservation partners to leverage
  resources and maximize the benefits for wildlife habitat. The BLM uses the latest
  geospatial data technologies to share wildlife and wildlife data within BLM and
  with partners to work more efficiently. This program will fund projects under the
  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act PL 117-58, Section 40804(b) Ecosystem Restoration.

- description: Made over 240 awards – Projects funded include those in collaboration
    with more than 20 western colleges and universities to advance knowledge for decision
    support tools and conservation practices.  All western States Fish and Game agencies
    were awarded at least two to three awards to assist in achieving mutual objectives
    for wildlife conservation. Invasive species projects were awarded to at least
    25 western counties to advance the control of invasive species that impact wildlife
    habitat. All wester bird observatories were awarded projects to help planning
    and NEPA decision support tool development. The highest priority areas for sage-grouse
    conservation within the BLM wildlife program are the Sagebrush Focal Areas identified
    by the FWS in October 2014 and subsequently identified by the BLM as Sagebrush
    Focal Areas in the proposed land use plans. Some of these Sagebrush Focal Areas
    cross state boundaries so those BLM State Offices will continue to demonstrate
    landscape scale management of sage-grouse habitats utilizing partners.  BLM programs
    will work with partners to focus research on assessment of other sage obligate
    species as BLM implements sagebrush conservation. BLM will support enhancement
    of knowledge of migratory pathways of migratory wildlife, in particular that of
    big game.   In addition, will be partnering with states to assess conservation
    needs of species of economic value and species in decline.
