objective: The objective of the Guardianship Assistance Program (GAP) is to provide
  Federal financial participation (FFP) to states, Indian tribes, tribal organizations
  and tribal consortia (tribes) who opt to provide guardianship assistance payments
  to relatives who have assumed legal guardianship of eligible children that they
  previously cared for as foster parents. This assistance is intended to prevent inappropriately
  long stays in foster care and to promote the healthy development of children through
  increased safety, permanency, and well-being.
