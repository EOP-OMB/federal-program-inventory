objective: The baseline tax system would not allow deductions in lieu of normal depreciation
  allowances for particular investments in particular industries. Instead, it generally
  would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities. In contrast,
  the Tax Code allows a deduction for certain energy efficient commercial building
  property. The basis of such property is reduced by the amount of the deduction.
  Starting in 2021, the maximum deduction amount per square foot will be increased
  by a cost-of -living adjustment.
