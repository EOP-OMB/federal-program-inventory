  \nOver the decades, extractive industry activities have left behind a number of\
  \ underground and aboveground mines and features that pose physical safety hazards\
  \ and have degraded the environment impacting various media.  \nThe program\u2019\
  s goal is to assist States and Federally Recognized  Indian Tribal Governments with\
  \ mitigating the physical safety and contaminant risks associated with hardrock,\
  \ non-coal abandoned mine sites and features. \n\nEligible activities that will\
  \ be approved for Federal Financial Assistance include inventory, assessment, decommission,\
  \ reclamation, response to hazardous substance releases, and remediation of abandoned\
  \ mine lands based on need, public health and safety, potential environmental harm,\
  \ and other land use priorities. Funds may be used for activities under National\
