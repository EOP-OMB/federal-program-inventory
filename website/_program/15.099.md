objective: "The U.S. Department of the Interior has been authorized to establish a\
  \ Hardrock Abandoned Mine Land Program under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs\
  \ Act (IIJA).  This program is separate and not inclusive of  the Office of Surface\
  \ Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s (OSMRE) Abandoned Mine Lands Program.\n\n\
  Over the decades, extractive industry activities have left behind a number of underground\
  \ and aboveground mines and features that pose physical safety hazards and have\
  \ degraded the environment impacting various media.  \n\nThe program’s goal is to\
  \ assist States and Federally Recognized  Indian Tribal Governments with mitigating\
  \ the physical safety and contaminant risks associated with hardrock, non-coal abandoned\
  \ mine sites and features."
