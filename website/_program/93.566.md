objective: "The Refugee Cash and Medical Assistance (CMA) Program reimburses States\
  \ and Replacement Designees for the cost of cash and medical assistance provided\
  \ to refugees, certain Amerasians from Vietnam, Cuban and Haitian entrants, asylees,\
  \ victims of a severe form of trafficking, Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrants,\
  \ certain Afghan Humanitarian Parolees, and certain Ukrainian Humanitarian Parolees\
  \ during the first 12 months after their date of arrival or date of eligibility.\
  \ Specifically, CMA covers the Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA), Refugee Medical Assistance\
  \ (RMA), and Medical Screening programs, and recipient administrative costs. CMA\
  \ also includes the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program, and reimbursement\
  \ is provided for care of enrolled URMs and recipient administrative costs. The\
  \ Refugee Support Services (RSS) Program provides formula funding for employment\
  \ and other social services for the same population for 5 years after their date\
  \ of arrival or date of eligibility. The RSS Program also supports \u201Cset-aside\u201D\
  \ funding to support specific populations or initiatives such as the Refugee School\
  \ Impact Program which supports the academic integration of refugee youth from birth\
  \ to age 18; the Services for Older Refugee Program which supports the integration\
  \ of refugees aged 60 and above; the Youth Mentoring Program which supports the\
  \ educational and vocational advancement of refugee young adults; and the Refugee\
  \ Health Promotion Program which builds the capacity of communities to address the\
  \ mental health and physical health needs of refugee populations. In FY 2022, in\
  \ response to new priorities, Congress appropriated specific funding to support\
  \ certain arrivals from Afghanistan and Ukraine. The Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriation,\
  \ 2022 and the Additional Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 (ASA)\
  \ supports services for certain Afghan arrivals; and the Additional Ukraine Supplemental\
  \ Appropriations Act, 2022 (AUSAA) supports services for certain Ukrainian arrivals.\
  \ See ORR Policy Letters 22-01, 22-02, 22-10, and 22-13 for additional information\
  \ on Afghan and Ukrainian arrivals eligible for these services."
