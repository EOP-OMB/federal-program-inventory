objective: The Refugee Cash and Medical Assistance (CMA) Program reimburses States
  and Replacement Designees for the cost of cash and medical assistance provided to
  refugees, certain Amerasians from Vietnam, Cuban and Haitian entrants, asylees,
  victims of a severe form of trafficking, Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrants, certain
  Afghan Humanitarian Parolees, and certain Ukrainian Humanitarian Parolees during
  the first 12 months after their date of arrival or date of eligibility. Specifically,
  CMA covers the Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA), Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA),
  and Medical Screening programs, and recipient administrative costs. CMA also includes
  the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program, and reimbursement is provided for
  care of enrolled URMs and recipient administrative costs. The Refugee Support Services
  (RSS) Program provides formula funding for employment and other social services
  for the same population for 5 years after their date of arrival or date of eligibility.
  The RSS Program also supports “set-aside” funding to support specific populations
  or initiatives such as the Refugee School Impact Program which supports the academic
  integration of refugee youth from birth to age 18; the Services for Older Refugee
  Program which supports the integration of refugees aged 60 and above; the Youth
  Mentoring Program which supports the educational and vocational advancement of refugee
  young adults; and the Refugee Health Promotion Program which builds the capacity
  of communities to address the mental health and physical health needs of refugee
  populations. In FY 2022, in response to new priorities, Congress appropriated specific
  funding to support certain arrivals from Afghanistan and Ukraine. The Afghanistan
  Supplemental Appropriation, 2022 and the Additional Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations
  Act, 2022 (ASA) supports services for certain Afghan arrivals; and the Additional
  Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 (AUSAA) supports services for certain
  Ukrainian arrivals. See ORR Policy Letters 22-01, 22-02, 22-10, and 22-13 for additional
  information on Afghan and Ukrainian arrivals eligible for these services.
