objective: "The objective of this program is to encourage smart, sensible and sustainable\
  \ pest control in agriculture.  The Pesticide Environmental Stewardship Program\
  \ (PESP) grants initiative, an extension of the PESP, will enable grantees to implement\
  \ sustainable pest management practices that align with the Agency's strategic goal\
  \ of providing a cleaner and healthier environment for all Americans. The Pesticide\
  \ Environmental Stewardship Program (PESP) grants initiative will support projects\
  \ that focus on sustainable pest management approaches, reduce the risks associated\
  \ with pesticide use in agricultural pest management, and integrated pest management\
  \ (IPM) implementation.\n\nThese assistance agreements support projects that explore\
  \ innovative practices, technologies, education, and non-regulatory solutions that\
  \ adopt integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. Projects address implementation\
  \ of environmentally sound pest management practices, approaches, training, and\
  \ innovations that reduce the risks associated with pesticide use in agricultural\
  \ settings and, where feasible, lead to corresponding reductions in greenhouse gas\
  \ emissions that contribute to climate change. These projects reduce unnecessary\
  \ exposures to pests and pesticides through the adoption of integrated pest management\
  \ practices and strengthen our shared goals of sustainable pest management. \n\n\
  Most recently funded projects are implementing arthropod IPM on watermelon farms\
  \ for pollinator protection, improving knowledge about IPM and pesticide safety,\
  \ integrating pest and pollinator management strategies for ornamental plant production,\
  \ and delivering herbicide resistance training through web-based and in-person workshops\
  \ to Pacific Northwest agricultural professionals."
