objective: The objective of this program is to encourage smart, sensible and sustainable
  pest control in agriculture. The Pesticide Environmental Stewardship Program (PESP)
  grants initiative enables grantees to implement sustainable pest management practices
  that align with the Agency's strategic goal of providing a cleaner and healthier
  environment for all Americans.  The PESP grants initiative supports projects that
  focus on sustainable pest management approaches, reduce the risks associated with
  pesticide use in agricultural pest management, and integrated pest management (IPM)
  implementation. Assistance agreements support projects that explore innovative practices,
  technologies, education, and non-regulatory solutions that adopt integrated pest
  management (IPM) strategies. Projects address implementation of environmentally
  sound pest management practices, approaches, training, and innovations that reduce
  the risks associated with pesticide use in agricultural settings and, where feasible,
  lead to corresponding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to
  climate change. These projects reduce unnecessary exposures to pests and pesticides
  through the adoption of integrated pest management practices and strengthen our
  shared goals of sustainable pest management. Most recently funded projects are implementing
  arthropod IPM on watermelon farms for pollinator protection, improving knowledge
  about IPM and pesticide safety, integrating pest and pollinator management strategies
  for ornamental plant production, and delivering herbicide resistance training through
  web-based and in-person workshops to Pacific Northwest agricultural professionals.

    to support more than 100 successful grants, awards for outstanding stewardship,
    and collaborative efforts that have promoted IPM in agriculture, schools, integrated
    vegetation management on utility rights-of-ways, information sharing on tick management
    strategies, and EPA Region-specific projects on sustainable pest management practices.  Today,
    over 400 organizations partner with EPA through PESP. For more information on

- description: 'Accomplishments to date from the six grant recipients include, but
    are not limited to the following: (1)University of Vermont (Grant: 84043601) -
    Extension held a pop-up field day in Orwell, VT on the importance of early season
    corn assessments for pest and nutrient management. This event was structured to
    encourage conversation and farmer-to-farmer learning among the 10 farmers and
    technical service providers in attendance. Within the context of integrated pest
    management, the importance of scouting for early season pests, managing risk,
    results from this ongoing neonic research, and the status of neonic legislation
    were discussed. A post-event survey was conducted, and respondents indicated the
    following as a result of attending: • 100% of attendees indicated that they gained
    applicable knowledge or confidence in pest management strategies • 70% of attendees
    reported that they are likely to make a change in management • 30% indicated they
    are somewhat likely to make a change based on what they learned at the event.
    (2) Oregon State University (Grant 84043501) - An abstract on herbicide resistance
    management was submitted as part of the project’s outreach activities to OSU Extension
    personnel. (3) West Virginia University (Grant: 84043901) - WVU facilitated and
    presented 15 workshops, with presentation topics such as Agricultural plant pest
    control; Forest pest control; Ornamental and turf outdoors; Aquatic Pest control;
    Right-of-way; Demonstration and research; Pesticide storage and distribution;
    Hardwood tree release, and Private Applicators. Conducted six Spanish-speaking
    trainings for 239 Spanish growers and agricultural workers.  (4) Purdue University
    (Grant 84043701) - Evaluated the impact of IPPM practices on watermelon quality
    by conducting three consecutive assessments (each separated by two-weeks) of IPM
    treatment effects on watermelon quality. To do so, Purdue implemented a new scouting
    protocol that entailed visually assessing insect rind damage on three fruits per
    acre, in conjunction with pest counts. In addition to counting the number of melons
    that were unmarketable, the grantee took images of fruits expressing rind damage
    so that assessors could quantify total rind area damaged per field and treatment.  (5)
    University of Florida, Gainesville (Grant: 84043801) - Presented research results
    and management recommendations at the North Carolina Nursery and Landscape Association’s
    Green and Growing Conference for landscape and nursery industry professionals
    in January 2023 in Greensboro, NC. Attended by approximately 400 people.  (6)
    University of Tennessee, Knoxville (Grant: 84044001) - Developed a database of
    states offering recertification points, and what the requirements are for applicators
    (e.g. number of points, window of time to earn points, etc.) as well as for instructors
    (number of minutes to offer a point, limited to approved topics, instructor qualifications,
    etc.)'
