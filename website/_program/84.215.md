objective: The Innovative Approaches to Literacy program supports high-quality programs
  designed to develop and improve literacy skills for children and students from birth
  through 12th grade in high-need local educational agencies and schools. The Promise
  Neighborhoods program supports distressed communities in improving the academic
  and developmental outcomes for children, youth, and their families from birth through
  college. The Full-Service Community Schools supports the planning, implementation,
  and operation of full-service community schools that improve the coordination, integration,
  accessibility, and effectiveness of services for children and families, particularly
  for children attending high-poverty schools, including high-poverty rural schools.  Congressionally
  Directed Spending for Elementary and Secondary Education Community Projects provides
  grants to entities identified in explanatory statements accompanying appropriation
