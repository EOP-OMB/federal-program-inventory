objective: Public Health Nursing (PHN) patient care coordination activities aim to
  serve the patient and family in the home and in the community.  Preventative health
  care informs populations, promotes healthy lifestyles, and provides early treatment
  for illnesses.  The PHNâ€™s expertise in communicable disease assessment, outreach,
  investigation, and surveillance aids in the management and prevention of the spread
  of communicable diseases.  PHNs conduct nurse home visiting services via referral
  for communicable disease investigation and treatment, which includes such services
  as health education/behavioral counseling for health promotion, risk reduction,
  and immunizations to prevent illnesses with a goal to detect and treat problems
  in their early stages.
