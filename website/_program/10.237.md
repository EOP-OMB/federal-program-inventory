objective: "The Next Gen Program represents one part in a series of efforts led by\
  \ USDA to achieve equitable participation of farmers, ranchers and forest land owners\
  \ in USDA programs and services through an array of targeted technical assistance\
  \ and outreach activities; to foster equity through meaningful, sustained engagement\
  \ with diverse stakeholders to inform USDA policies and programs; and to support\
  \ and prepare diverse students for future careers in agriculture through Section\
  \ 1006 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\nThe Next Gen Program is focused\
  \ first and foremost on supporting and preparing students at MSIs for careers in\
  \ the food, agriculture, natural resources, and human sciences across research,\
  \ education, and extension, with an emphasis on federal government sector employment.\
  \ \nThe goal of this program is to enable a specific set of minority-serving institutions\
  \ to engage, recruit, retain, train, and support students in order to help build\
  \ and sustain the next generation of the food, agriculture, natural resources, and\
  \ human sciences workforce including the future USDA workforce. NEXTGEN Evaluation\
  \ Program (NEXTE) is established to determine the impact and effectiveness of the\
  \ NEXTGEN investment. Through a cooperative agreement, NIFA will collaborate with\
  \ and fund the Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA) to perform\
  \ a suite of evaluative activities to determine the effectiveness of the NEXTGEN\
  \ program and inform USDAâ€™s career development and training initiatives."
