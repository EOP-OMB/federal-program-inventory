objective: "Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of chemical compounds\
  \ that are highly resistant to degradation and easily bioaccumulate in the environment.\
  \ They are found in a broad range of products ranging from food packaging, non-stick\
  \ cookware, water-proofing sealants, and fire-fighting foams used at public and\
  \ military airfields. The study of PFAS is ongoing, but lab and epidemiological\
  \ studies have found possible human health risks to PFAS exposure.\n\nThere is potential\
  \ that agricultural lands and the commodities they produce can become contaminated\
  \ through a variety of means, and there are many factors that influence if a particular\
  \ property is impacted. These factors include the type and concentration of PFAS,\
  \ climate, hydrogeology, geology, and environmental conditions. \n\nThis program\
  \ will support the ongoing study of PFAS agricultural contamination, mitigation,\
  \ and remediation, as well as the dissemination of information about PFAS risks\
  \ to agricultural producers. It covers the testing of soil, water, and agricultural\
  \ products. It will also assist agricultural producers affected by PFAS contamination\
  \ with costs to mitigate the impacts to their operations that have resulted from\
  \ such contamination and provide relief for agricultural producers suffering losses\
  \ for unmarketable crops, livestock, and other agricultural products related to\
  \ PFAS contamination.\n\nEligibility is open to State and local governments, U.S.\
  \ Territories, Federally recognized Tribal governments, nonprofit organizations,\
  \ and institutes of higher education."
