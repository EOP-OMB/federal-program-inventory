objective: "Under the authority of the Fiscal Year 2023 Consolidated Appropriations\
  \ Act, Section 766, USDA sought to award states that had established tolerance thresholds\
  \ for PFAS in food and agricultural products. Maine was the only state to have tolerance\
  \ thresholds at the time of award. \n\nThe primary objectives of this Cooperative\
  \ Agreement are:\n\n•\tAssistance and Indemnification: Assisting agricultural producers\
  \ affected by PFAS contamination with costs related to mitigating the impacts to\
  \ their operation that have resulted from such contamination and indemnifying agricultural\
  \ producers for the value of unmarketable crops, livestock, and other agricultural\
  \ products related to PFAS contamination. Conducting research on alternative cropping\
  \ systems, PFAS uptake in crops and livestock to ensure marketable products, the\
  \ use of systems to mitigate PFAS impacts in agricultural operations, and support\
  \ for farm management decisions. This may include the development and dissemination\
  \ of farming operation guidance materials to agricultural producers to assist their\
  \ actions to address PFAS contamination or the development and dissemination of\
  \ consumer education materials that support farming operations. \n\n•\tPFAS Testing:\
  \ Testing of agricultural sites at the request of a producer with known or suspected\
  \ PFAS contamination, evaluating the capacity of PFAS testing for agriculture, development\
  \ of testing methods for diverse agricultural matrices and products, and support\
  \ for lab analysis. Researching and establishing agronomic safety criteria and guidance\
  \ for farm products, including associated educational materials. These activities\
  \ will allow the recipient to meet the needs of producers’ current and future requests\
  \ for PFAS testing of diverse agricultural samples and products."
