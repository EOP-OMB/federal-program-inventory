objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain
  types or sources of income. However, under current law certain timber sales can
  be treated as a capital gain rather than ordinary income and therefore subject to
  the lower capital-gains tax rate. Current law allows capital gains to be taxed at
  a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 20 percent (plus the 3.8 percent
  surtax).
