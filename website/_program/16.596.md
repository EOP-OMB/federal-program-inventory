  \ strengthen tribal justice system capacity by addressing physical infrastructure\
  \ needs.\n\nObjective:  To support the critical and priority needs of tribal justice\
  \ systems, to prevent crime, and to ensure tribal safety through the development,\
  \ implementation, and enhancement of strategies, including the following: \n\n•\
  \ To engage in comprehensive, justice system-wide strategic planning to improve\
  \ tribal justice and safety, including improving services for victims of crime,\
  \ improving community wellness, and increasing the ability to prevent crime and\
  \ respond to violent crime. \n• To prevent and respond to violent crime in tribal\
  \ communities, including investigations, forensics, prosecutions, information sharing,\
  \ and supervision and re-entry in coordination with other key federal and state\
  \ partners. \n• To enhance the tools and resources for tribal prosecutors, courts,\
  \ and corrections agencies, including tribal probation and tribal jails, and to\
  \ effectively respond to crime and related tribal safety. \n• To implement enhanced\
  \ authorities and provisions under the Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) and the Violence\
  \ Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022and to support the development of joint\
  \ jurisdiction courts with state and local courts. \n• To prevent future crime by\
  \ addressing the risks and needs of young adults (ages 18–25) who are involved with\
  \ or at risk of involvement with the justice system. \n• To ensure safety through\
  \ coordinated support for the re-entry of returning tribal members from federal\
  \ or state prison sentences. \n• To develop, enhance, and continue programs to improve\
  \ the safety and effectiveness of tribal law enforcement officers such as planning\
  \ for and developing their own law enforcement agency, law enforcement support as\
  \ part of a larger strategy, or court security issues such as adding an officer\
  \ at the courthouse to improve court security. \n• To develop, implement, and enhance\
  \ substance abuse and crime prevention, interventions, and alternatives to incarceration\
  \ to address crime related to the opioid epidemic. This can include opioid, alcohol,\
  \ and other substance use disorder and related crime prevention; healing to wellness\
  \ courts; intervention; or treatment, including those that prevent and address the\
  \ needs of drug-endangered children. \n• To address physical tribal justice system\
  \  infrastructure needs through the renovation, expansion or construction of single\
  \ jurisdiction or regional tribal justice-related facilities. \n\nPerformance Measure\
  \ 1: Number of tribes that have implemented or enhanced tribal courts; alternative\
  \ justice courts; prevention, diversion or alternatives to incarceration programs;\
  \  treatment programs; institutional or community corrections; reentry programs;\
