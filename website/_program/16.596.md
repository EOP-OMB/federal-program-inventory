  \ implementation, and enhancement of strategies, including the following: \n\n•\
  \ To engage in comprehensive, justice system-wide strategic planning to improve\
  \ tribal justice and safety, including improving services for victims of crime,\

  \ authorities and provisions under the Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) and the Violence\
  \ Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022  \n\n• To prevent future crime by addressing\
  \ the risks and needs of young adults (ages 18–25) who are involved with or at risk\
  \ of involvement with the justice system.  \n\n• To ensure safety through coordinated\
  \ support for the re-entry of returning tribal members from federal or state prison\
  \ sentences.  \n\n• To develop, enhance, and continue programs to improve the safety\
  \ and effectiveness of tribal law enforcement officers such as planning for and\

  \ to improve court security.  \n\n• To develop, implement, and enhance substance\
