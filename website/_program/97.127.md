objective: "Section 2220 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (codified as amended\
  \ at 6 U.S.C. § 665f) establishes the CETAP within CISA. The statutory purpose of\
  \ CETAP is to support CISA’s efforts in building and strengthening a national cybersecurity\
  \ workforce pipeline capacity through enabling elementary and secondary cybersecurity\
  \ education. This includes providing foundational cybersecurity awareness and literacy,\
  \ encouraging cybersecurity career exploration, and supporting the teaching of cybersecurity\
  \ skills at the elementary and secondary education levels. To fund such cybersecurity\
  \ and infrastructure security education and training programs and initiatives, Section\
  \ 2220 authorizes CISA to provide financial assistance to non-federal entities to\
  \ carry out the statutory CETAP purposes and enhance CETAP to address the national\
  \ shortfall of cybersecurity professionals. \n\nCISA awards financial assistance\
  \ under the CETAP through cooperative agreements with non-profit organizations to\
  \ develop cybersecurity curriculum and professional development opportunities for\
  \ K-12 students, educators, administrators, and student caregivers and conduct outreach\
  \ to increase cybersecurity awareness within that K-12 community. The objectives\
  \ of CETAP financial assistance are to: (1) create cyber training pathways for K-12\
  \ students and educators by providing an adaptable cybersecurity curricular model;\
  \ (2) promote awareness of national cybersecurity education opportunities; (3) develop\
  \ partnerships and increase stakeholder engagement to maximize outreach efforts\
  \ and the impact of cybersecurity education across the K-12 community; and (4) increase\
  \ awareness of all CETAP tools and resources."
