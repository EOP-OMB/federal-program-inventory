objective: "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Cyber Defense\
  \ Education & Training (CDET) team is committed to strengthening the nation\u2019\
  s federal and national cybersecurity workforce through standardizing roles and helping\
  \ to ensure we have well-trained cybersecurity professionals today as well as a\
  \ strong pipeline of future cybersecurity leaders tomorrow.\n\nCDET manages training\
  \ and education programs that promote awareness as well as create opportunities\
  \ for citizens to become cybersecurity professionals needed to secure the nation\u2019\
  s cyber infrastructure and information systems. CDET makes investments in resources\
  \ to educate the Nation to address current and future cybersecurity challenges by\
  \ building and sustaining an adaptive cybersecurity workforce as a national asset.\
  \ \n\nThrough CETAP, DHS/CISA seeks to \n1.\tTarget K-12 educators, administrators,\
  \ guidance counselors, and caregivers and promote awareness of national cybersecurity\
  \ education and workforce training and education opportunities. \n2.\tCreate pathways\
  \ for K-12 educators and potential educators and students by providing an adaptable\
  \ cybersecurity curricular model that targets K-12 students (with a priority toward\
  \ K-8) to include hands-on, engaging cybersecurity-integrated curriculum, gamified\
  \ activities, competitions, and ready-to-use-tools.\n3.\tDevelop partnerships and\
  \ increase stakeholder engagement to maximize outreach efforts and the impact of\
  \ cybersecurity education in the K-12 community.\n4.\tDevelop and implement a comprehensive\
  \ regional engagement strategy that enables CISA and its regional partners to increase\
  \ awareness of all CETAP tools and resources, specifically to underserved and underrepresented\
  \ communities. \n\nThrough Cyber Workforce Development/NTTP, DHS/CISA seeks to Implement\
  \ an engaging training hub (virtual, in person, or a hybrid combination) covering\
  \ both national and regional cybersecurity challenges to deliver cybersecurity training\
  \ to underserved communities and connect participants and employers in one or more\
  \ CISA regions. \n1.\tImplement an apprenticeship and/or placement program for entry-level\
  \ cybersecurity professionals that\u2019s supported by affiliations with cybersecurity\
  \ entities who may support program enrollees and/or graduates.\n2.\tDecrease the\
  \ cybersecurity workforce shortage and equity gap by placing NTTP program graduates\
  \ into full-time, entry-level cybersecurity jobs."

- description: "FY2022:  The Cybersecurity Education and Training Assistance Program\
    \ (CETAP) will continue to see significant increases and building off of previous\
    \ years successes. By the end of FY22, CETAP impacted nearly 30,000 educators\
    \ through curricula access and have trained just shy of 24,000 teachers over the\
    \ lifespan of the grant. Major projects include expansion of the Historically\
    \ Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) feeder program (Project REACH) to 10\
    \ HBCUs across the country with approximately 30 high schools participating in\
    \ the program. \n\nFY2022: The Cybersecurity Workforce Development and Training\
    \ for Underserved Communities (NTTP) pilot program will continue to see significant\
    \ development of curricula, a virtual or hybrid in-person training hub, and an\
    \ entry-level skilled apprenticeship program for underserved populations. The\
    \ non-traditional technical training providers (NTTPs) have approved Cybersecurity\
    \ Pathways Retention Strategies that are used to track performance measures, to\
    \ include identifying goals for reaching the target population over the lifespan\
    \ of the cooperative agreement. During the first year of the cooperative agreement,\
    \ the NTTPs enrolled, roughly, 116 individuals into training activities. Through\
    \ CyberWarrior\u2019s 28-week training course and NPower\u2019s 18-week training\
    \ course, 77 individuals have graduated and received certifications ranging from\
    \ A+ to Security+. Of those graduates, 30 have obtained employment in cyber fields."
