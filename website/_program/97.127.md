objective: "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Cyber Defense\
  \ Education & Training (CDET) team is committed to strengthening the nation\u2019\
  s federal and national cybersecurity workforce through standardizing roles and helping\
  \ to ensure we have well-trained cybersecurity professionals today as well as a\
  \ strong pipeline of future cybersecurity leaders tomorrow.\n\nCDET manages training\
  \ and education programs that promote awareness as well as create opportunities\
  \ for citizens to become cybersecurity professionals needed to secure the nation\u2019\
  s cyber infrastructure and information systems. CDET makes investments in resources\
  \ to educate the Nation to address current and future cybersecurity challenges by\
  \ building and sustaining an adaptive cybersecurity workforce as a national asset.\
  \ \n\nThrough CETAP, DHS/CISA seeks to \n1.\tTarget K-12 educators, administrators,\
  \ guidance counselors, and caregivers and promote awareness of national cybersecurity\
  \ education and workforce training and education opportunities. \n2.\tCreate pathways\
  \ for K-12 educators and potential educators and students by providing an adaptable\
  \ cybersecurity curricular model that targets K-12 students (with a priority toward\
  \ K-8) to include hands-on, engaging cybersecurity-integrated curriculum, gamified\
  \ activities, competitions, and ready-to-use-tools.\n3.\tDevelop partnerships and\
  \ increase stakeholder engagement to maximize outreach efforts and the impact of\
  \ cybersecurity education in the K-12 community.\n4.\tDevelop and implement a comprehensive\
  \ regional engagement strategy that enables CISA and its regional partners to increase\
  \ awareness of all CETAP tools and resources, specifically to underserved and underrepresented\
  \ communities. \n\nThrough Cyber Workforce Development/NTTP, DHS/CISA seeks to Implement\
  \ an engaging training hub (virtual, in person, or a hybrid combination) covering\
  \ both national and regional cybersecurity challenges to deliver cybersecurity training\
  \ to underserved communities and connect participants and employers in one or more\
  \ CISA regions. \n1.\tImplement an apprenticeship and/or placement program for entry-level\
  \ cybersecurity professionals that\u2019s supported by affiliations with cybersecurity\
  \ entities who may support program enrollees and/or graduates.\n2.\tDecrease the\
  \ cybersecurity workforce shortage and equity gap by placing NTTP program graduates\
  \ into full-time, entry-level cybersecurity jobs."
