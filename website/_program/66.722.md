objective: The objective of this program, required by TITLE VI—PESTICIDES, Subtitle
  A—Pesticide Registration, Improvement Act (PRIA) of 2022, SEC. 704. REREGISTRATION
  AND EXPEDITED PROCESSING FUND. Section 4(k) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,
  and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136a-1(k)(6)(B) is to “administer training and education
  programs for employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, relating to the regulatory
  responsibilities and policies established by this Act, including programs—H. R.
  2617—1546 (I) for improving the scientific, technical, and administrative skills
  of officers and employees authorized to administer programs under this Act; (II)
  to align competencies identified by the Administrator for mission accomplishment;
  (III) for addressing best practices for operational performance and improvement;
  (IV) for improving administrative processes and procedures and addressing efficiency
  issues; (V) to promote consistent regulatory decision-making; and (VI) for educating
  registrants and regulated stakeholders on regulatory procedures.” The goal is to
  improve the efficiency, clarity and consistency of EPA’s pesticide registration
  and re-registration processes. The desired outcome is to reduce backlogs through
  process improvements, clear instructions, and consistent decision making.  Measurements
  may be the reduction in backlog, how quickly new EPA staff are trained, the number
  and availability of training materials for EPA staff, and customer satisfaction.
