- description: A total of 42 John R. Justice Student Loan Repayment Program awards
    were made to John R. Justice State Administering Agencies totaling $1,817,067.00
    in the 2018 Fiscal Year (FY). A projection of FY 2019 is currently unavailable
    due to the solicitation still being open. The Bureau of Justice Statistics will
    calculate a minimum base allocation for each state, territory, and the District
    of Columbia. This minimum base allocation will then be supplemented by an amount
    proportional to that state’s or territory’s share of the national population.
    BJA reserves the right to reallocate unrequested funding in any fiscal year for
    use by participating states and to reduce future awards by amounts unexpended
    from the prior year, all based upon such reasonable formulas as is necessary to
    extend accessibility to program funding.
