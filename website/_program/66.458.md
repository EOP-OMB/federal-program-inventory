objective: 'To create State Revolving Funds (SRFs) through a program of capitalization
  grants to States which will provide a long-term source of State financing for construction
  of wastewater treatment facilities and implementation of other water quality management
  activities. Capitalization grants are available to each State for the purpose of
  establishing a Clean Water SRF for providing assistance for: (1) construction of
  publicly owned wastewater treatment works; (2) implementation of nonpoint source
  management activities included in State Plans developed pursuant to Section 319;
  (3) development and implementation a National Estuary Program comprehensive conservation
  and management plan under Section 320; (4) the construction, repair, or replacement
  of decentralized wastewater treatment systems that treat municipal wastewater or
  domestic sewage; (5) measures to manage, reduce, treat or recapture stormwater or
  subsurface drainage water; (6) any municipality or intermunicipal, interstate, or
  State agency for measures to reduce the demand for publicly owned treatment works
  capacity through water conservation, efficiency or reuse; (7) the development and
  implementation of watershed projects meeting the criteria set forth in section 122;
  (8) any municipality or intermunicipal, interstate, or State agency for measures
  to reduce the energy consumption needs for publicly owned treatment works; (9) reusing
  or recycling wastewater, stormwater, or subsurface drainage water; (10) measures
  to increase the security of publicly owned treatment works; (11) any qualified nonprofit
  entity, as determined by the Administrator, to provide assistance to owners and
  operators of small and medium publicly owned treatment works to plan, develop, and
  obtain financing for eligible projects under section 603(c), including planning,
  design, and associated preconstruction activities and to assist such treatment works
  in achieving compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA); and (12) any qualified nonprofit
  entity, as determined by the Administrator, to provide assistance to an eligible
  individual (as defined in subsection (j))â€” (A) for the repair or replacement of
  existing individual household decentralized wastewater treatment systems or in a
  case in which an eligible individual resides in a household that could be cost effectively
  connected to an available publicly owned treatment works, for the connection of
  the applicable household to such treatment works. The program supports the Agency''s
  strategic goal of providing clean and safe water. The Infrastructure Investment
  and Jobs Act (IIJA), 2021, (Public Law 117-58), makes available additional capitalization
  grants to each state for the purpose of providing assistance through the Clean Water
  SRF to: (1) activities identified above and (2) activities identified above for
  projects that address emerging contaminants. The capitalization grant is deposited
  in the State''s SRF, which is used to provide loans and other types of financial
  assistance, to local communities, intermunicipal and interstate agencies, and other
  eligible entities as described in Title VI of the Clean Water Act. Division N of
  the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Public Law 117-328 also includes $665.2
  million in supplemental funding for the CWSRF, available only to states or territories
  in EPA Regions 2 and 4 for treatment works impacted by Hurricanes Fiona or Ian.
  A maximum of four percent of the grant amounts, $400,000 each year, or 1/5 percent
  per year of the current valuation (total net position) of the fund may be used by
  the States for the cost of administering the SRF. States determine priorities for
  funding within their State in accordance with the CWA. For the 51 State CWSRFs,
  a portion of the capitalization grant funding must be used to provide additional
  subsidy in the form of grants, principal forgiveness, or negative interest loans.'
