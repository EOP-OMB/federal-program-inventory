objective: 'To create State Revolving Funds (SRFs) through a program of capitalization
  grants to States which will provide a long-term source of State financing for construction
  of wastewater treatment facilities and implementation of other water quality management
  activities.


  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: Capitalization grants are available to each
  State for the purpose of establishing a Clean Water SRF for providing assistance
  for: (1) construction of publicly owned wastewater treatment works; (2) implementation
  of nonpoint source management activities included in State Plans developed pursuant
  to Section 319; (3) development and implementation a National Estuary Program comprehensive
  conservation and management plan under Section 320; (4) the construction, repair,
  or replacement of decentralized wastewater treatment systems that treat municipal
  wastewater or domestic sewage; (5) measures to manage, reduce, treat or recapture
  stormwater or subsurface drainage water; (6) any municipality or intermunicipal,
  interstate, or State agency for measures to reduce the demand for publicly owned
  treatment works capacity through water conservation, efficiency or reuse; (7) the
  development and implementation of watershed projects meeting the criteria set forth
  in section 122; (8) any municipality or intermunicipal, interstate, or State agency
  for measures to reduce the energy consumption needs for publicly owned treatment
  works; (9) reusing or recycling wastewater, stormwater, or subsurface drainage water;
  (10) measures to increase the security of publicly owned treatment works; (11) any
  qualified nonprofit entity, as determined by the Administrator, to provide assistance
  to owners and operators of small and medium publicly owned treatment works to plan,
  develop, and obtain financing for eligible projects under section 603(c), including
  planning, design, and associated preconstruction activities and to assist such treatment
  works in achieving compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA); and (12) any qualified
  nonprofit entity, as determined by the Administrator, to provide assistance to an
  eligible individual (as defined in subsection (j))â€” (A) for the repair or replacement
  of existing individual household decentralized wastewater treatment systems or in
  a case in which an eligible individual resides in a household that could be cost
  effectively connected to an available publicly owned treatment works, for the connection
  of the applicable household to such treatment works. The program supports the Agency''s
  strategic goal of providing clean and safe water. The Infrastructure Investment
  and Jobs Act (IIJA), 2021, (Public Law 117-58), makes available additional capitalization
  grants to each state for the purpose of providing assistance through the Clean Water
  SRF to: (1) activities identified above and (2) activities identified above for
  projects that address emerging contaminants. The capitalization grant is deposited
  in the State''s SRF, which is used to provide loans and other types of financial
  assistance, to local communities, intermunicipal and interstate agencies, and other
  eligible entities as described in Title VI of the Clean Water Act.  Division N of
  the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Public Law 117-328 also includes $665.2
  million in supplemental funding for the CWSRF, available only to states or territories
  in EPA Regions 2 and 4 for treatment works impacted by Hurricanes Fiona or Ian.  A
  maximum of four percent of the grant amounts, $400,000 each year, or 1/5 percent
  per year of the current valuation (total net position) of the fund may be used by
  the States for the cost of administering the SRF. States determine priorities for
  funding within their State in accordance with the CWA. For the 51 State CWSRFs,
  a portion of the capitalization grant funding must be used to provide additional
  subsidy in the form of grants, principal forgiveness, or negative interest loans.'
