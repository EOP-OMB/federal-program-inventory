objective: "To create State Revolving Funds (SRFs) through a program of capitalization\
  \ grants to States which will provide a long-term source of State financing for\
  \ construction of wastewater treatment facilities and implementation of other water\
  \ quality management activities.\n\nFunding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: Capitalization\
  \ grants are available to each State for the purpose of establishing a Clean Water\
  \ SRF for providing assistance for: (1) construction of publicly owned wastewater\
  \ treatment works; (2) implementation of nonpoint source management activities included\
  \ in State Plans developed pursuant to Section 319; (3) development and implementation\
  \ a National Estuary Program comprehensive conservation and management plan under\
  \ Section 320; (4) the construction, repair, or replacement of decentralized wastewater\

  \ as determined by the Administrator, to provide assistance to owners and operators\
  \ of small and medium publicly owned treatment works to plan, develop, and obtain\
  \ financing for eligible projects under section 603(c), including planning, design,\
  \ and associated preconstruction activities and to assist such treatment works in\
  \ achieving compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA); and (12) any qualified nonprofit\
  \ entity, as determined by the Administrator, to provide assistance to an eligible\
  \ individual (as defined in subsection (j))\u2014 (A) for the repair or replacement\

  \ cost effectively connected to an available publicly owned treatment works, for\
  \ the connection of the applicable household to such treatment works. The program\
  \ supports the Agency's strategic goal of providing clean and safe water. The Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), 2021, (Public Law 117-58), makes available additional\
  \ capitalization grants to each state for the purpose of providing assistance through\
  \ the Clean Water SRF to: (1) activities identified above and (2) activities identified\
  \ above for projects that address emerging contaminants. The capitalization grant\
  \ is deposited in the State's SRF, which is used to provide loans and other types\
  \ of financial assistance, to local communities, intermunicipal and interstate agencies,\
  \ and other eligible entities as described in Title VI of the Clean Water Act. \
  \ Division N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Public Law 117-328 also\
  \ includes $665.2 million in supplemental funding for the CWSRF, available only\
  \ to states or territories in EPA Regions 2 and 4 for treatment works impacted by\
  \ Hurricanes Fiona or Ian.  A maximum of four percent of the grant amounts, $400,000\
  \ each year, or 1/5 percent per year of the current valuation (total net position)\
  \ of the fund may be used by the States for the cost of administering the SRF. States\
  \ determine priorities for funding within their State in accordance with the CWA.\
  \ For the 51 State CWSRFs, a portion of the capitalization grant funding must be\
  \ used to provide additional subsidy in the form of grants, principal forgiveness,\
  \ or negative interest loans."
