objective: "GENERAL: The Cooperative Extension Service (CES) has an important role\
  \ in reducing the impact of disasters through extension education. The Extension\
  \ Special Needs program sponsors targeted projects that enable CES to assist in\
  \ preparing for, providing an educational response to, and recovering from disasters.\
  \ Education programming funded by this program will help communities, families and\
  \ individuals become more self-sustaining by strengthening and increasing their\
  \ resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards and disaster related events funded\
  \ in previous years include uncertainties caused by losses of economic infrastructure,\
  \ severe weather or other natural disasters, security breaches, human disease, or\
  \ high consequence animal diseases and plant pests. There has been an increase in\
  \ public awareness regarding the number and severity of disaster type critical incidents\
  \ involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, contagious disease,\
  \ and terrorist events. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Environment\
  \ and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the National\
  \ Science and Technology Council have acknowledged the many effective roles that\
  \ the Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played in disaster preparedness, response\
  \ and remediation. Within the states and territories, the CES has repeatedly served\
  \ as the trusted community organization that has helped to enable families, communities,\
  \ and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond to and cope with disaster\
  \ losses and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred, the local extension\
  \ outreach includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based risk information,\
  \ 2) Developing relevant educational experiences and programs, 3) Working with individuals\
  \ and communities to open new communication channels, and 4) Mitigating losses and\
  \ facilitating recovery. Never was this more evident than after hurricanes Katrina,\
  \ Rita and Wilma in 2005 and during the 2008 Midwestern Summer flooding. During\
  \ and after these incidents, local Extension agents served as a critical communication\
  \ node throughout affected urban and rural areas, particularly when traditional\
  \ communication systems were temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed. The Extension\
  \ Special Needs RFA encourages proposals that specifically address one or more of\
  \ the following six key target areas: 1. Education and Technical assistance through\
  \ inter-disciplinary and multi-state disaster training programs and demonstration\
  \ projects for problem solving, especially those which build upon already existing\
  \ strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN and/or eXtension educational materials\
  \ related to disaster preparation, mitigation, response and recovery; 2. Collaboration\
  \ with Federal, state and local agencies and other disaster relief organizations\
  \ to support education and service activities that enhance recovery of impacted\
  \ rural communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based activities; 3. Long\
  \ range family, community and regional planning projects that will enhance implementation\
  \ of programs that serve public needs in preparation for, during and after emergency\
  \ situations within impacted States and across impacted regions; 4. Communication\
  \ delivery of key information that meets end-users\u2019 needs in a timely fashion\
  \ with consideration of potentially limited communication channels due to disaster\
  \ situations; 5. Dissemination of credible, science-based information that is reliable\
  \ and easily accessible even if electronic access is compromised; and 6. Integrated\
  \ Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000) are intended to provide\
  \ assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for the development of highly\
  \ competitive grant proposals where extension personnel would apply for large grants\
  \ (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs and lead nationally important\
  \ disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects. Fundable projects should\
  \ support education and extension activities which: 1. Reduce risk through planning,\
  \ disaster preparedness and emergency response by improving communication between\
  \ the public, community leaders, state and Federal agencies; 2. Develop strategies\
  \ and educational materials and/or programming in the area of emergency planning,\
  \ infrastructure design and disaster recovery operation; 3. Develop community networks\
  \ that provide real-time disaster education information;"
