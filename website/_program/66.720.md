objective: "Grants are awarded to support education, outreach, training, and technical\
  \ assistance to farm workers on how to prevent or mitigate pesticide-related illness\
  \ and injury; to health care providers on recognizing and treating pesticide-related\
  \ illness and injury; and to organizations to give technical assistance to grant\
  \ recipients or applicants of such grants.\n\nMeasures may include an increase in\
  \ awareness of how to minimize, prevent, or mitigate occupational exposure to pesticides,\
  \ and treat pesticide-related illness and injury; the number of and/or reach of\
  \ projects on the safe use of pesticides by agricultural pesticide handlers; and\
  \ awareness and reach of technical assistance to the public on information about\
  \ pesticides, their uses, risks, and reporting exposures.\n\nFunding priorities\
  \ are:\n\n1. Train and educate farm workers with respect to farm workers' rights\
  \ relating to pesticide safety and on the agricultural Worker Protection Standard\
  \ (WPS) regulation at 40 CFR part 170. Develop new informational materials, training\
  \ modules, and innovative delivery methods for both. \n\n2. Develop informational\
  \ materials and provide technical assistance and training to health care providers\
  \ on the recognition, treatment, and management of pesticide-related injuries and\
  \ illnesses. Develop methods on the outreach and delivery of such materials and\
  \ technical assistance. \n\n3. Provide technical assistance to recipients and potential\
  \ recipients concerning the grant application process, drafting grant applications\
  \ and compliance with grant management and reporting requirements."
