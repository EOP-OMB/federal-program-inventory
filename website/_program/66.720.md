  \ assistance to farm workers on how to prevent or mitigate pesticide-related illness\
  \ and injury; to health care providers on recognizing and treating pesticide-related\
  \ illness and injury; and to organizations to give technical assistance to grant\

  \ pesticides, their uses, risks, and reporting exposures.\n\nFunding priorities\
  \ are:\n\n1. Train and educate farm workers with respect to farm workers' rights\
  \ relating to pesticide safety and on the agricultural Worker Protection Standard\
  \ (WPS) regulation at 40 CFR part 170. Develop new informational materials, training\
  \ modules, and innovative delivery methods for both. \n\n2. Develop informational\
  \ materials and provide technical assistance and training to health care providers\
  \ on the recognition, treatment, and management of pesticide-related injuries and\
