objective: 'Grants are awarded to support education, outreach, training, and technical
  assistance to farm workers on how to prevent or mitigate pesticide-related illness
  and injury; to health care providers on recognizing and treating pesticide-related
  illness and injury; and to organizations to give technical assistance to grant recipients
  or applicants of such grants.  Measures may include an increase in awareness of
  how to minimize, prevent, or mitigate occupational exposure to pesticides, and treat
  pesticide-related illness and injury; the number of and/or reach of projects on
  the safe use of pesticides by agricultural pesticide handlers; and awareness and
  reach of technical assistance to the public on information about pesticides, their
  uses, risks, and reporting exposures.


  In FY2025, priorities will continue to include:  training and educating  farm workers
  with respect to farm workers'' rights relating to pesticide safety and on the agricultural
  Worker Protection Standard (WPS) regulation at 40 CFR part 170; developing new informational
  materials, training modules, and innovative delivery methods for both; developing
  informational materials and providing technical assistance and training to health
  care providers on the recognition, treatment, and management of pesticide-related
  injuries and illnesses; developing methods on the outreach and delivery of such
  materials and technical assistance; and providing  technical assistance to recipients
  and potential recipients concerning the grant application process, drafting grant
  applications and compliance with grant management and reporting requirements.'
