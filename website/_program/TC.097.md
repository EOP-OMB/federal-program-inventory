objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. However, the Tax Code allows taxpayers who make qualified
  equity investments in a community development entity (CDE), which then make qualified
  investments in low-income communities, to be eligible for a tax credit that is received
  over 7 years. The total equity investment available for the credit across all CDEs
  is generally $5 billion for each calendar year 2020 through 2025, the last year
  for which credit allocations are authorized.
