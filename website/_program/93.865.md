  \ with people that explore health processes. NICHD researchers examine growth and\
  \ development, biologic and reproductive functions, behavior patterns, and population\
  \ dynamics to protect and maintain the health of all people.  To examine the impact\
  \ of disabilities, diseases, and defects on the lives of individuals. With this\
  \ information, the NICHD hopes to restore, increase, and maximize the capabilities\
  \ of people affected by disease and injury.  To sponsor training programs for scientists,\
  \ doctors, and researchers to ensure that NICHD research can continue. By training\
  \ these professionals in the latest research methods and technologies, the NICHD\
  \ will be able to conduct its research and make health research progress until all\
  \ children, adults, families, and populations enjoy good health.\r\n\r\nThe mission\
  \ of the NICHD is to ensure that every person is born healthy and wanted, that women\
  \ suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that all children have\
  \ the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free\
  \ from disease or disability, and to ensure the health, productivity, independence,\
  \ and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation."
