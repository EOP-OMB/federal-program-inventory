objective: The objective of the Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Program is to work cooperatively
  with states, Tribes, and other entities as they study, design and construct aquatic
  ecosystem restoration projects that are collaboratively developed, have widespread
  regional benefits, and result in the improvement of the health of fisheries, wildlife,
  and aquatic habitat through restoration and improved fish passage. As used here,
  “aquatic ecosystem” refers to freshwater and brackish water habitats such as lakes,
  ponds, rivers, streams, wetlands, swamps, and estuaries and the adjacent floodplains,
  riparian corridors, deltas, and shallow aquifers that interact with surface water.
