  training, professional development, and technical assistance to State educational
  agencies, local educational agencies, regional educational agencies, and schools
  to improve educational outcomes for all students, close achievement gaps, and improve
  the quality of instruction.  By statute, the Department is required to establish
  at least 1 center in each of the 10 geographic regions served by the Department's
  regional educational laboratories (RELs).  Information on the REL regions is available
  at http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/.)

- description: 'Regional Centers provide intensive capacity-building services to help
    SEAs and other recipients identify, implement, and sustain effective evidence-based
    practices that improve instruction and student outcomes. The National Center provides
    universal and targeted capacity-building services to address common high-leverage
    problems and common programmatic monitoring and audit findings, as well as information
    on emerging national education issues. The Centersâ€™ work has taken on additional
    meaning during the COVID-19 crisis, and Centers successfully pivoted to provide
    services to help SEAs and LEAs adapt to difficult and changing situations, revising
    their service plans on an on-going basis to address changing needs. Centers raised
    awareness of existing resources and services, provided information to SEAs to
    inform their resource allocation decisions in ways that would support educational
    equity, improved literacy instruction, and the educator workforce. The National
    Center supported the Summer Learning and Enrichment Collaborative, a national
    professional learning community bringing together state and local organizations
    across all 50 states and U.S. territories to explore how to leverage American
    Rescue Plan (ARP) and other federal funds to support effective summer learning
    and enrichment opportunities to meet the needs of students most impacted by the
    pandemic. As needed, Regional Centers support SEAs implementing recovery plans
    and help SEAs identify how to integrate stimulus funding into ESEA plans.
