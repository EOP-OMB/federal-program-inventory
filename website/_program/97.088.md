objective: 'This category is not for unsolicited proposals. Provides funding that
  has been designated by Congressionally appropriated authorization, generally for
  a specified project, or to provide unique or limited scope funding for certain disaster
  assistance Projects identified by Congress or a DHS program office. Program funds
  support the National Preparedness Goal of enhancing core capabilities in the areas
  of disaster response and recovery. One such disaster project is the Disaster Case
  Management (DCM) Program, which is a disaster-related federal award. DCM supports
  the Recovery core capability and mission area as defined in the National Preparedness
  Goal. The objective of DCM is to assist individuals and households through the recovery
  process by connecting survivors with local resources to meet their disaster-caused
  unmet needs. A disaster-caused unmet need is any un-resourced item, support, or
  assistance that has been assessed and verified as necessary for a survivor to recover
  from disaster. This may include but is not limited to: food, clothing, shelter,
  first aid, emotional and spiritual care, household items, temporary housing, home
  repair, or rebuilding.'
