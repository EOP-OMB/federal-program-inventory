layout: program
objective: To improve alfalfa and forage yield and seed yield of crops grown for propagation,
  improve persistence of plantings, reduce pest pressure for both forage and seed
  production, improve genetic quality of commercial cultivars and reduce losses during
  harvest and storage.
