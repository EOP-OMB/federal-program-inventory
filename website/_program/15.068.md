objective: "The Office of Native Hawaiian Relations’ (ONHR) Heritage (Tourism) Opportunities\
  \ in Hawaiʻi (HŌʻIHI) Grant Program serves to implement the provisions of the Native\
  \ American Tourism and Improving Visitor Experience Act (NATIVE Act), 25 U.S.C.\
  \ 4351 et seq.  The purposes of the NATIVE Act are to establish a more inclusive\
  \ national travel and tourism strategy and has the potential to deliver significant\
  \ benefits for Native Hawaiian organizations (NHO) as distinctly defined in the\
  \ NATIVE Act, including job creation, elevated living standards, and expanded economic\
  \ opportunities.  \n\n\nTourism is a major economic driver for Hawaiʻi that has\
  \ long been experienced by the Native Hawaiian community as extractive and transactional.\
  \ NATIVE Act funding equips NHO’s across Hawaiʻi with additional resources to change\
  \ that experience in ways mutually beneficial to visitors and the islands’ original\
  \ stewards. A sustainable and equitable tourism model recognizes that an enriching\
  \ visitor experience depends on thriving local communities with deep pilina (connection)\
  \ to and aloha (love) for Hawaiʻi’s natural and cultural resources."
