objective: "The Office of Native Hawaiian Relations\u2019 (ONHR) Heritage (Tourism)\
  \ Opportunities in Hawai\u02BBi (H\u014C\u02BBIHI) Grant Program serves to implement\
  \ the provisions of the Native American Tourism and Improving Visitor Experience\
  \ Act (NATIVE Act), 25 U.S.C. 4351 et seq.  The purposes of the NATIVE Act are to\
  \ establish a more inclusive national travel and tourism strategy and has the potential\
  \ to deliver significant benefits for Native Hawaiian organizations (NHO) as distinctly\
  \ defined in the NATIVE Act, including job creation, elevated living standards,\
  \ and expanded economic opportunities.  \n\n\nTourism is a major economic driver\
  \ for Hawai\u02BBi that has long been experienced by the Native Hawaiian community\
  \ as extractive and transactional. NATIVE Act funding equips NHO\u2019s across Hawai\u02BB\
  i with additional resources to change that experience in ways mutually beneficial\
  \ to visitors and the islands\u2019 original stewards. A sustainable and equitable\
  \ tourism model recognizes that an enriching visitor experience depends on thriving\
  \ local communities with deep pilina (connection) to and aloha (love) for Hawai\u02BB\
  i\u2019s natural and cultural resources."
