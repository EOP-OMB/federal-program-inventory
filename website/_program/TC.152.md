objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities
  or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code provides an additional
  incentive for lower-income taxpayers to save through a nonrefundable credit of up
  to 50 percent on IRA and other retirement contributions of up to $2,000. This credit
  is in addition to any deduction or exclusion. The credit is completely phased out
  by $76,500 for joint filers, $57,375 for head of household filers, and $38,250 for
  other filers in 2024. Starting in Tax Year 2027, the Saver’s Credit, which is nonrefundable,
  is replaced with the Saver’s Match, which is refundable.
