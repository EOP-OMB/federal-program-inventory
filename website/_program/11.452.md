  sociological, public policy, and other research and administration projects to benefit
  U.S. fisheries industries and contribute to the economic and social welfare of the
  Nation; also, to award grants and cooperative agreements to develop innovative approaches
  and methods for ensuring the safety, quality and integrity of U.S. fishery products;
  also, to provide funds to the five States bordering the Gulf of Mexico, for projects
  or other measures designed to alleviate the long-term effects of disasters on the
  Gulf's fishery resources and associated habitat. To facilitate the administration,
  coordination and implementation of the research activities of the Cooperative Institute
  for Fisheries Molecular Biology (FISHTEC).  The goal of FISHTEC is to develop, test,
  and apply new technology in molecular biology for use in management of commercial
  and recreational marine fisheries.  Emphasis of the research program is placed on
  development of molecular genetics techniques to identify and evaluate the status
  of fish stocks/populations subject to fishing pressure and/or environmental impacts.  To
  support the implementation of community-based demonstration projects in the U.S.
  western Pacific that promote the development of fishery-related industries and the
  economic self-sufficiency of native Pacific islanders and communities.
