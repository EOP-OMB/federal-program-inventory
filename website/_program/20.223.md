objective: "To finance projects of national or regional significance by filling market\
  \ gaps and leveraging substantial non-Federal and private co-investment.  Transportation\
  \ Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) credit assistance is intended\
  \ to facilitate the financing of projects that would otherwise have been significantly\
  \ delayed because of funding limitations or difficulties accessing the capital markets.\
  \  Through TIFIA, the DOT provides Federal credit assistance to eligible highway,\
  \ transit, rail, and intermodal freight projects, including access to seaports.\
  \ \n\nThe Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST), enacted in December\
  \ 2015, authorized the establishment of a Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Demonstration\
  \ Program (the Program) to assist entities in developing improved infrastructure\
  \ priorities and financing strategies for the accelerated development of a project\
  \ that is eligible for funding under the TIFIA Program.  The Build America Bureau\
  \ issued a NOFO on December 8, 2020, to implement the Program."
