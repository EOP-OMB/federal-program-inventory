    \ NHSC clinicians serve patients in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs)\
    \ – communities with limited access to health care.  As of September 30, 2018,\
    \ there were 6,815 primary care HPSAs, 5,632 dental HPSAs, and 4,929 mental health\
    \ HPSAs.\n\nThe NHSC seeks clinicians who demonstrate a commitment to serve the\
    \ Nation’s medically underserved populations at NHSC-approved sites located in\
    \ HPSAs. NHSC-approved sites provide care to individuals regardless of ability\
    \ to pay; currently, there are over 16,400 NHSC-approved sites.  Eligible sites\
    \ include Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and FQHC Look-Alikes, American\

    \ with HRSA-supported FQHCs to help meet their staffing needs.  Over 60 percent\
    \ of NHSC clinicians serve in Health Centers around the nation, and 15 percent\
    \ of clinical staff at FQHCs are NHSC clinicians. The NHSC also places clinicians\
    \ in other community-based systems of care that serve underserved populations,\
