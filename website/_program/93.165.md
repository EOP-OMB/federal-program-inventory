- description: "Since its inception in 1972, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC)\
    \ has worked to support qualified health care providers dedicated to working in\
    \ underserved communities in urban, rural, and tribal areas. Across the nation,\
    \ NHSC clinicians serve patients in HPSAs \u2013 communities with limited access\
    \ to health care. As of September 30, 2022, there were 7,037 primary care HPSAs,\
    \ 6,304 dental HPSAs, and 5,839 mental health HPSAs. The NHSC seeks clinicians\
    \ who demonstrate a commitment to serve the Nation\u2019s medically underserved\
    \ populations at NHSC-approved sites located in HPSAs. NHSC-approved sites provide\
    \ care to individuals regardless of ability to pay; currently, there are over\
    \ 16,400 NHSC-approved sites. Eligible sites include Federally Qualified Health\
    \ Centers (FQHC) and FQHC Look-Alikes, American Indian and Native Alaska health\
    \ clinics, rural health clinics, critical access hospitals and hospitals managed\
    \ or owned by the Indian Health Service (IHS), school-based clinics, mobile units,\
    \ free clinics, community mental health centers, state or local health departments,\
    \ community outpatient facilities, federal facilities such as the Bureau of Prisons,\
    \ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, IHS, and private practices. In particular,\
    \ the NHSC has partnered closely with HRSA-supported FQHCs to help meet their\
    \ staffing needs. Over 60 percent of NHSC clinicians serve in Health Centers around\
    \ the nation, and 15 percent of clinical staff at FQHCs are NHSC clinicians. The\
    \ NHSC also places clinicians in other community-based systems of care that serve\
    \ underserved populations, targeting HPSAs of greatest need. As of September 30,\
    \ 2022, there are more than 16,000 primary care medical, dental, and mental and\
    \ behavioral health practitioners providing service nationwide."
