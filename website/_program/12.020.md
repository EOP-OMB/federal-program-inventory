objective: "1.   STARBASE 2.0 is an afterschool, middle and high school mentoring\
  \ initiative conducted in partnership with local school districts that combines\
  \ STEM activities with a relationship-rich, school-based environment to provide\
  \ the missing link for youth making the transition from elementary to middle school,\
  \ and from middle to high school. STEM clubs are expected to meet no less than four\
  \ hours per month, for a minimum of 20 hours per school year.\n\n2.   STARBASE 3.0\
  \ provides extracurricular STEM instruction and projects to high school students\
  \ and is typically offered after school or during the summer. The program is highly\
  \ structured and helps support school goals, fosters ingenuity and creativity, builds\
  \ confidence and resilience, encourages experimentation and teamwork, and teaches\
  \ students how to solve problems using critical thinking skills to improve knowledge\
  \ and skills of students from kindergarten through twelfth grade in STEM. \n\n3.\
  \   The Program is a non-combat, civil-military activity of the National Guard"
