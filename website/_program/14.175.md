objective: To provide mortgage insurance for an adjustable rate mortgage which may
  offer a lower interest rate initially that a fixed rate mortgage, and which remains
  constant for an initial period of 1, 3, 5, 7 or 10 years.  The interest rate may
  then change annually for the remainder of the mortgage term.   The loan structure
  provides built-in limits or safeguards for both consumers and lenders, designed
  to minimize the effect of any rapid rise in interest rates.
