objective: This funding program works with partners to better support long term operations
  focused on education on and promotion of biochar production and utilization.  Increasing
  biochar production and utilization will expand markets for materials with limited
  uses that are removed from forests during restoration and management operations.  The
  goal is to reduce cost of forest management work while providing a natural renewable
  product that can improve soils, water quality and other uses, as well as increasing
  carbon storage.
