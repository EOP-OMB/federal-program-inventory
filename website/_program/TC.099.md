objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. In addition, it would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allowed local
  governments to issue up $10 billion in taxable Recovery Zone Economic Development
  Bonds in 2009 and 2010 and receive a direct payment from Treasury equal to 45 percent
  of interest expenses. In addition, local governments could issue up to $15 billion
  in tax exempt Recovery Zone Facility Bonds. These bonds financed certain kinds of
  business development in areas of economic distress.
