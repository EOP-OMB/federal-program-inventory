objective: "Both the National Dam Safety Program (NDSP) state assistance grant and\
  \ the Rehabilitation of High Hazard Potential Dams (HHPD) grant programs improve\
  \ the safety of dams in the United States and strive to achieve the key objective\
  \ of \u201C dam safety and dam risk reduction\u201D. \nBoth grant programs implement\
  \ the Department of Homeland Security and Presidential Preparedness Directive (PPD)-8\
  \ objective of hazard mitigation, to develop and maintain those capabilities necessary\
  \ to reduce the loss of lives and property by lessening the impact of the failure\
  \ of dams. \n\nNDSP State Assistance Grant Program (NDSP-SA): The NDSP-SA accomplishes\
  \ this objective by supporting state and U.S. territory governments in the establishment\
  \ and maintenance of effective State programs intended to ensure dam safety, protect\
  \ human life and property, and increase the capacity and capability of State dam\
  \ safety programs.\n\nHigh Hazard Potential Dam (HHPD) Grant Program: The HHPD grant\
  \ program accomplishes this objective by providing funding to state and U.S. territory\
  \ governments for the rehabilitation of eligible high hazard potential dams that\
  \ fail to meet minimum state dam safety standards and pose unacceptable risk to\
  \ life and property."
