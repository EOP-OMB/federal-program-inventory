objective: FHA's 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage program is HUD's primary program for
  the rehabilitation and repair of one to four family properties. It is an important
  tool for community and neighborhood revitalization and for expanding homeownership
  opportunities.  The 203(k) program works with either a purchase or refinance transaction
  and allows the cost of making repairs and/or improvement to be included in the loan
  amount.
