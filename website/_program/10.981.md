objective: The Commodity Storage Assistance Program (CSAP) will provide assistance
  to producers in affected counties that were impacted by eligible disaster events
  that damaged or destroyed local commercial elevators from December 2021 to December
  31, 2024. The CSAP cost-share assistance program is made available to producers
  to construct on-farm storage structures to support the marketing of the storage
  limitations in the affected county. CSAP assistance may be available to certain
  commodity groups nationwide in FSA defined affected counties. CSAP will help producers
  prepare for the upcoming crop harvest and assist producers who are currently experiencing
  marketing disruptions and limited storage options due to damaged or destroyed local
  commercial elevators in their local area. CSAP funds are anticipated to cover a
  percentage of the eligible expenses associated with purchasing and building on-farm
  storage capacity in the affected county.
