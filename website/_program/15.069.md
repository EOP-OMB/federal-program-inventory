  \ of the program being on strengthening the foundation of an interjurisdictional\
  \ landscape-level wildlife health and disease network to protect wildlife, ecosystems,\
  \ economies, and the American public. Funding will be used to establish and enhance\
  \ Tribal, State, and Territorial fish and wildlife agencies\u2019 capability to\
  \ effectively address health issues involving free-ranging terrestrial, avian, and\
  \ aquatic wildlife and minimize the negative impacts of health issues affecting\
  \ free-ranging wildlife through surveillance, management, and research to protect\
  \ the public against zoonotic disease outbreaks. Allowable activities include research\
  \ and extension activities to strengthen early detection, rapid response, and science-based\
  \ management to address wildlife disease outbreaks before they become pandemics\
  \ and strengthen capacity for wildlife health monitoring to enhance early detection\
  \ of diseases that have capacity to jump the species barrier and pose a risk in\
  \ the United States."
