objective: Assistance will be available for a range of activities with the focus of
  the program being on strengthening the foundation of an interjurisdictional landscape-level
  wildlife health and disease network to protect wildlife, ecosystems, economies,
  and the American public. Funding will be used to establish and enhance Tribal, State,
  and Territorial fish and wildlife agenciesâ€™ capability to effectively address health
  issues involving free-ranging terrestrial, avian, and aquatic wildlife and minimize
  the negative impacts of health issues affecting free-ranging wildlife through surveillance,
  management, and research to protect the public against zoonotic disease outbreaks.
  Allowable activities include research and extension activities to strengthen early
  detection, rapid response, and science-based management to address wildlife disease
  outbreaks before they become pandemics and strengthen capacity for wildlife health
  monitoring to enhance early detection of diseases that have capacity to jump the
  species barrier and pose a risk in the United States.
