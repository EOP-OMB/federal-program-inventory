- description: "a.) Conferences:\r\nThe SBTRCs participate in conferences to share\
    \ resources and knowledge within/beyond the transportation learning community,\
    \ communicating to the public the needs and contributions of transportation. \
    \ Also, to build partnership linkages in order to promote transportation programs\
    \ in a seamless manner.  We estimate in FY16 the SBTRCs will participate in 205\
    \ conferences and provide procurement assistance to an estimated 3,600 DBEs.\r\
    \n\r\nb.) Short-Term Lending Program (STLP) Workshops:\r\nThe SBTRCs work with\
    \ OSDBU’s STLP participating lenders to organize seminars and workshops on this\
    \ accounts receivable financial access program that is available to eligible DBEs\
    \ and small businesses.  The seminars and workshops cover the entire STLP process,\
    \ form completion of the STLP loan application and preparation of the loan package\
    \ to approval and loan management.  We estimate in FY16 the SBTRCs will conduct\
    \ 52 workshops.\r\n\r\nc.) Bonding Education Program (BEP)\r\nThe SBTRCs in partnership\
    \ with Surety and Fidelity Association of America (SFAA) combine classroom instruction\
    \ and one-on-one meetings with surety professionals to help small businesses obtain\
    \ a bonding line and apply that capacity to transportation related projects. \
    \ This effort is facilitated by DOT’s network of regional offices, the SBTRCs\
    \ around the country, as program partners whose role is to provide outreach, logistics,\
    \ technical assistance, and coordination for the local program efforts.  In FY16\
    \ will estimate the SBTRCs will conduct 68 Bonding Education Programs in various\
    \ cities across the country.\r\n\r\nd.) Women In Transportation Initiative\r\n\
    An SBTRC created transportation-focused career awareness program designed to encourage\
    \ young women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\
    \  The program also advances the development of professional potential by providing\
    \ quality educational experiences, training, and employment opportunities to students\
    \ interested in transportation related careers.  Annually students are placed\
    \ in internships with small businesses, federal, state, and local transportation\
    \ agencies.  The students gained valuable work experience to assist them in future\
    \ career choices.  We estimate in FY16 the SBTRCs will recruit 30 students to\
    \ participate in the internship.\r\n a.) Conferences:\r\nThe SBTRCs participate\
