objective: The Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program (Program)
  is a collaborative effort consisting of 18 stakeholders including federal, state,
  and local governmental entities; Indian tribes and pueblos; and non-governmental
  organizations representing diverse interests working to protect and improve the
  status of endangered listed species along the Middle Rio Grande (MRG) by implementing
  certain recovery activities to benefit those species and their associated habitats
  and, simultaneously, to protect existing and future water uses while complying with
  applicable state and federal laws, including Rio Grande compact delivery obligations.
  “Listed species” means federally listed species under the ESA, with special emphasis
  on the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (silvery minnow) and the southwestern willow flycatcher
  (flycatcher).

    improving the status of the silvery minnow and the flycatcher, and the conservation
    and contribution to the recovery of both listed species while protecting existing
    and future water uses within the geographic boundaries of the Program area.  In
    FY2016and FY2017, these activities included: endangered species propagation and
    augmentation and habitat restoration monitoring.'

- description: "Fiscal Year 2019: The City of Albuquerque’s Aquatic Conservation Facility\
    \ (ACF) and the State of New Mexico’s Los Lunas Silvery Minnow Refugium (LLSMR)\
    \ continue to promote the recovery of the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow in the wild\
    \ through captive propagation, augmentation, and research. Funding for these facilities\
    \ comes from several sources including Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility\
    \ Authority, the State of New Mexico, and Reclamation. They are breeding, rearing,\
    \ and research centers that include indoor and outdoor culture systems and naturalized\
    \ refugiums. The indoor systems are used for quarantine, breeding, egg hatching,\
    \ and rearing larvae. The outdoor systems are used for raising larvae to sub-adult\
    \ age and for holding large numbers of broodstock. The outdoor naturalized refugium\
    \ are river-like environments with controllable flow, variable depth, variable\
    \ habitat, and natural substrate. \n\nThe University of New Mexico (UNM) has monitored\
    \ the genetics of the silvery minnow population since 1999. This work includes\
    \ monitoring silvery minnow bred or reared in captivity and released to the MRG\
    \ since 2002 when the augmentation program began. UNM continues to genotype all\
    \ broodstock produced for release in the MRG in the ACF and LLSMR. Under this\
    \ contract, UNM also examines changes in levels of genetic variability in the\
    \ wild silvery minnow population and how these changes potentially impacted population\
    \ viability, and the potential impacts of captive propagation and augmentation\
    \ on the genetics of silvery minnow wild stock. The silvery minnow genetics database\
    \ developed by the project was used to develop, parameterize, and evaluate models\
    \ designed to assist in predicting genetic effects of captive propagation on wild\
    \ stocks of silvery minnow (under various scenarios) to inform captive propagation\
    \ and augmentation strategies aimed at species recovery. \n\nBased on recommendations\
    \ from a peer review panel, Reclamation funded UNM’s development of High-Throughput\
    \ Markers for silvery minnow. Using cutting-edge technology this project will\
    \ develop a panel of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that will allow for\
    \ an enhanced and rapid assessment of silvery minnow genetic diversity within\
    \ and among ex situ and in situ populations and develop a sex-specific marker.\
    \ With these markers available it will be possible to know the genetics of the\
    \ fish being stocked during augmentation.  This project was completed in FY19\
    \ and the results will be applied to work into the future."
