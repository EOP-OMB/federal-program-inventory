rules_regulations: "FFATA:  As noted, FFATA was further amended in 2014 by the Digital\
  \ Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) to, among other items, require\
  \ summary financial data be reported by Federal agencies in addition to Federal\
  \ award data.  2 CFR part 25 Federal awards impacted by these requirements include\
  \ grants, sub-grants, loans, awards, cooperative agreements, and other forms of\
  \ financial assistance as well as contracts, subcontracts, purchase orders, task\
  \ orders, and delivery orders.\nAs the purpose of this part is to provide the public\
  \ with information about how their tax dollars are spent, the following information\
  \ must be provided for primary awards receiving federal funds that meet or exceed\
  \ the micro-purchase threshold currently set at $10,000 for procurement contracts\
  \ and for subawards exceeding $30,000 reporting.  All subgrants that exceed $25,000\
  \ will also be required to report.  \nAMS will be leveraging eFG and interfacing\
  \ directly with USASpending.gov.  To ensure data quality, AMS will leverage the\
  \ preexisting processes utilized across multiple grant programs administered through\
  \ eFG.  Additionally, our defined monitoring and reporting oversight will serve\
  \ as verification safeguard. \nData Quality and Transparency:  In addition to the\
  \ normal, multi-phase review and analysis conducted for grantee reports, AMS will\
  \ adhere to the existing MRP Data Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act)\
  \ Quality Plan."
