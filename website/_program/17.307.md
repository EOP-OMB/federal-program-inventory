results:
- description: The Black Lung program successfully reduced the percentage of claims
    pending for more than 365 days from 20% to 12% over the prior two years.
  year: '2020'
- description: In FY 2021, the Black Lung program provided payment of nearly $200M
    in total compensation and medical benefits, while servicing more than 30,000 beneficiaries.
  year: '2021'
- description: The Federal Black Lung program provided $183.6 million in disability
    compensation and medical benefits while servicing 28,628 coal miners with black
    lung diseases and their families. The Black Lung program also took many strides
    forward to strengthen customer experience and service delivery for miners with
    black lung, including beginning the process of simplifying the forms miners use
    to file for benefits and completing the programâ€™s first ever customer experience
    feedback survey. Critically, in fiscal year 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation
    Reduction Act, which permanently extended the excise tax on underground and surface-mined
    coal, which is the primary source of revenue for the Black Lung Disability Trust
    Fund. The Black Lung program also worked diligently to complete a Notice of Proposed
    Rulemaking (NPRM) to address issues involving self-insured coal miner operators.
    The NPRM was ultimately published in January 2023.
