objective: Under the baseline tax system, unrealized capital gains would be taxed
  when assets are transferred at death. It would not allow for exempting gains upon
  transfer of the underlying assets to the heirs. In contrast, capital gains on assets
  held at the owner’s death are not subject to capital gains tax under current law.
  The cost basis of the appreciated assets is adjusted to the market value at the
  owner’s date of death which becomes the basis for the heirs.
