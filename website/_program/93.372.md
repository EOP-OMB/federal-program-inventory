objective: To provide extramural research support for the Brain Research Through Advancing
  Innovative Neurotechnologies® (BRAIN) Initiative’s aim of revolutionizing our understanding
  of the brain and its function in unprecedented detail. The NIH BRAIN Initiative’s
  focus is foundational development of new technologies and tools to map, monitor,
  and modulate brain circuits in model systems and humans – toward the ultimate goal
  of treating and curing human brain disorders. BRAIN Initiative research adheres
  to open, ethical, and inclusive science – and requires diverse expertise across
  all domains. BRAIN-supported research areas include comprehensive cataloguing, mapping,
  accessing and characterization of brain cell types ; probing neural circuits that
  interact and produce behavior, cognition, and emotion; developing and employing
  new  technologies to monitor function and connectivity of synapses, circuits, and
  whole brains; partnering with human research participants, including  utilizing
  neurotechnologies in first-in-human clinical studies, to study the human brain in
  the context of brain injury and brain disorders; and establishing data-sharing platforms
  and computational models that help decode brain processes and functions. Within
  these scientific focus areas, the Initiative supports research project grants, cooperative
  agreements, workforce development awards and Small Business Innovation Research
  awards. Research supported by the Initiative has a strong commitment to broad dissemination
  of newly developed technologies, and to considering neuroethical issues related
  to studying the human brain and the neuroscience advances that follow from this
  research. New frontiers for BRAIN research will adhere to, and build on, what has
  been learned to date and adapt to the rapidly changing scientific landscape and
  neuroscience ecosystem.

- description: NIH BRAIN Initiative-funded researchers (funded from all of these scientific
    priority areas) have made significant advances – made possible in part by 21st
    Century Cures funding. They have created a system for studying circuits in a postmortem
    animal brain; programmed a computer to mimic natural speech from people’s brain
    signals; and developed a new viral genetic-based brain mapping tool. Through advanced
    imaging techniques, they have watched neurons fire in the brains of running mice
    and made high-speed, high-resolution, 3D films of a nervous system in action.
    These scientists have created the most detailed ‘parts list’ of the human brain
    to date and shown how it can remarkably adapt after one half is damaged or remove  by
    re-wiring specialized neural networks.
