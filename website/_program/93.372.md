objective: To provide support for initiatives funded under the 21st Century Cures
  Act to support the BRAIN Initiative’s aim of revolutionizing our understanding of
  the human brain. By accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies,
  researchers will be able to produce a revolutionary new dynamic picture of the brain
  that, for the first time, shows how individual cells and complex neural circuits
  interact in both time and space. Long desired by researchers seeking new ways to
  treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, this picture will fill major gaps
  in our current knowledge and provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring exactly
  how the brain enables the human body to record, process, utilize, store, and retrieve
  vast quantities of information, all at the speed of thought.

- description: NIH BRAIN Initiative-funded researchers (funded from all of these scientific
    priority areas) have made significant advances – made possible in part by 21st
    Century Cures funding. They have created a system for studying circuits in a postmortem
    animal brain; programmed a computer to mimic natural speech from people’s brain
    signals; and developed a new viral genetic-based brain mapping tool. Through advanced
    imaging techniques, they have watched neurons fire in the brains of running mice
    and made high-speed, high-resolution, 3D films of a nervous system in action.
    These scientists have created the most detailed ‘parts list’ of the human brain
    to date and shown how it can remarkably adapt after one half is damaged or remove  by
    re-wiring specialized neural networks.
