objective: "To further achieve its mission, AmeriCorps has a strong belief in the\
  \ importance of research in order to identify effective strategies for national\
  \ service and increase the evidence-base for its programs. This means engaging the\
  \ broader community of academic researchers involved in studying and evaluating\
  \ national service, volunteerism, and civic infrastructure. The goal of this competition\
  \ is to increase the nation\u2019s understanding and knowledge about the importance\
  \ and potential of volunteering, national and community service, and/or civic engagement\
  \ in America.  We are seeking applications that build on existing research in the\
  \ field, address gaps in knowledge, and provide new ideas and methodological approaches\
  \ to the study of national service."
