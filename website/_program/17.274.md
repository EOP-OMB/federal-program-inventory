objective: Grant funds will be used to equip underserved youth with the education
  and employment skills necessary to achieve economic self-sufficiency.  Program services
  include post-secondary education and training opportunities, including apprenticeship;
  opportunities for meaningful work and service to their communities; and opportunities
  to develop employment and leadership skills and a commitment to community development.  As
  part of their programming, YouthBuild grantees will partner with underserved youth
  to increase the supply of permanent affordable housing for homeless individuals
  and low-income families and to assist youth to develop the leadership, learning,
  and in-demand occupational skills needed to succeed in future careers.
