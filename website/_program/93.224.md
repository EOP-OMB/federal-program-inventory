objective: 'To improve the health of the Nation''s underserved communities and vulnerable
  populations by ensuring continued access to comprehensive, culturally competent,
  high-quality primary health care services for communities and populations currently
  served by the Health Center Program. Individual health center grant mechanisms include:

  primary care services at existing health centers, and expand primary health care
  services related to emerging public health issues, including public health emergencies.'
