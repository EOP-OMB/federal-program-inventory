objective: The Sikes Act attempts to ensure that fish, wildlife and other natural
  resources that exist on and are associated with military lands in the United States
  are protected and enhanced. The Sikes Act is written such that conservation activities
  are promoted while allowing military lands to continue to meet the needs of military
  operations.
