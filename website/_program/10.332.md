objective: The National Institute of Food and Agricultureâ€™s Agricultural Genome to
  Phenome Initiative (AG2PI) Assistance Listing 10.332, focuses on collaborative science
  engagement that brings together a community of researchers across both crops and
  animals to lay the foundation for expanding knowledge concerning genomes and phenomes
  of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States. Applications that
  propose a collaboration among U.S. crop and animal researchers are encouraged. In
  FY 2022, Congress recognized the value of leading public and land-grant universities
  with unique high-throughput phenotyping and greenhouse facilities and expertise
  for plant science innovation, root and rhizome innovation, and food for health.
  Congress provided funding for the Genome to Phenome program and encouraged NIFA
  to support the development of tools and datasets that can be used across multiple
  crop species to develop advanced genome engineering tools for integrated optimization
  of crop yield and animal feed for improved animal reproduction and nutrition and
  to mitigate environmental impacts from crop and animal production.
