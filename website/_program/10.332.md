objective: "The National Institute of Food and Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Genome\
  \ to Phenome Initiative (AG2PI) Assistance Listing 10.332, focuses on collaborative\
  \ science engagement that brings together a community of researchers across both\
  \ crops and animals to lay the foundation for expanding knowledge concerning genomes\
  \ and phenomes of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States. Applications\
  \ that propose a collaboration among U.S. crop and animal researchers are encouraged.\
  \ In FY 2022, Congress recognized the value of leading public and land-grant universities\
  \ with unique high-throughput phenotyping and greenhouse facilities and expertise\
  \ for plant science innovation, root and rhizome innovation, and food for health.\
  \ Congress provided funding for the Genome to Phenome program and encouraged NIFA\
  \ to support the development of tools and datasets that can be used across multiple\
  \ crop species to develop advanced genome engineering tools for integrated optimization\
  \ of crop yield and animal feed for improved animal reproduction and nutrition and\
  \ to mitigate environmental impacts from crop and animal production."
