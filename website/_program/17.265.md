objective: To support employment and training services for Native Americans, Alaska
  Natives, and Native Hawaiian individuals in order to develop more fully the academic,
  occupational, and literacy skills of such individuals; to make such individuals
  more competitive in the workforce and to equip them with the entrepreneurial skills
  necessary for successful self-employment; and to promote the economic and social
  development of Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian communities
  in accordance with the goals and values of such communities. All programs assisted
  under this section shall be administered in a manner consistent with the principles
  of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et
  seq.) and the government-to-government relationship between the Federal Government
  and Indian tribal governments. Supplemental youth funding is also awarded to help
  low-income Native American youth and Native Hawaiian youth, between the ages of
  14 and 24, acquire the educational and occupational skills needed to achieve academic
  and employment success and transition to careers and productive adulthood.
