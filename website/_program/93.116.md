objective: 'To assist State, local health agencies, political subdivisions, and other
  government entities to conduct TB preventive health service programs to assist in
  carrying out tuberculosis (TB) control activities designed to prevent transmission
  of infection and disease. Financial assistance is provided to TB programs to ensure
  that the program needs for core TB prevention and control activities, human resource
  development and public health laboratories are met.  In addition, objectives include:
  finding all cases of active tuberculosis and ensuring completion of therapy; finding
  and screening persons who have had contact with TB patients, evaluating them for
  TB infection and disease, and ensuring completion of appropriate treatment; and
  conducting TB surveillance and TB public health laboratory activities that are essential
  to addressing these priorities.  Each of these core activities (completion of therapy,
  contact investigation, TB surveillance, and TB laboratory activities) is essential
  to effective TB prevention and control.'
