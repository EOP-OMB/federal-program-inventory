objective: 'This program assists State, local health agencies, political subdivisions,
  and other government entities to conduct TB preventive health service programs to
  assist in carrying out tuberculosis (TB) control activities designed to prevent
  transmission of infection and disease. Financial assistance is provided to TB programs
  to ensure that the program needs for core TB prevention and control activities,
  human resource development and public health laboratories are met.  In addition,
  objectives include: finding all cases of active tuberculosis and ensuring completion
  of therapy; finding and screening persons who have had contact with TB patients,
  evaluating them for TB infection and disease, and ensuring completion of appropriate
  treatment; and conducting TB surveillance and TB public health laboratory activities
  that are essential to addressing these priorities.  Each of these core activities
  (completion of therapy, contact investigation, TB surveillance, and TB laboratory
  activities) is essential to effective TB prevention and control.'
