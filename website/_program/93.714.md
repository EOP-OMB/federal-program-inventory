objective: This funding was to provide economic stimulus to the nation while furthering
  the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) mission to promote the economic
  and social well-being of children, youth, families, and communities.  The objective
  of the program was to provide up to $5 billion for jurisdictions (States, Territories,
  and Tribes) in fiscal year (FY) 2009 and FY 2010 that had an increase in assistance
  caseloads and/or certain types of expenditures.  This Emergency Fund was in addition
  to the TANF Contingency Fund in section 403(b) of the Social Security Act that gives
  money to qualifying States (but not Territories or Tribes) during an economic downturn.
