objective: "The Environmental Management Research and Development Program provides\
  \ for the development of technologies to safely expedite tank waste processing and\
  \ tank closure, remediation of contaminated groundwater and soil, disposition of\
  \ nuclear materials and spent (used) nuclear fuel, and deactivation and decommissioning\
  \ of contaminated excess facilities.\r\nThe Environmental Management Research and\
  \ Development program transforms science and innovation into practical solutions\
  \ for environmental cleanup. The new technologies will transform the Environmental\
  \ Management cleanup effort by reducing risk (technological, environmental, safety,\
  \ and health), schedule, and cost. The Environmental Management\r\nResearch and\
  \ Development program focuses on resolving technical challenges with an overall\
  \ emphasis on transformational technical solutions in response to the highest priority\
  \ needs of Environmental Management sites. Applied engineering and research demonstrating\
  \ the technical feasibility of high-risk, high-payoff technologies are included.\
  \ The Environmental Management Research and Development program matures technologies\
  \ from concept/basic science through feasibility assessment and technology development\
  \ (bench scale and scale-up testing and flow-sheet evaluation), then production-level\
  \ demonstration, and finally to full deployment."
