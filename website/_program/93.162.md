  Program (LRP) is to recruit and retain medical, nursing, dental, and behavioral/mental
  health clinicians in eligible communities of need designated as Health Professional
  Shortage Areas (HPSAs). The purpose of the NHSC Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Workforce
  LRP is to recruit and retain medical, nursing, and behavioral/mental health clinicians
  with specific training and credentials to provide evidence-based SUD treatment and
  counselling in eligible communities of need designated as HPSAs. The purpose of
  the NHSC Rural Community LRP is to recruit and retain medical, nursing, and behavioral/mental
  health clinicians with specific training and credentials to provide evidence-based
  SUD treatment in rural communities designated as HPSAs. The purpose of the NHSC
  Students to Service (S2S) LRP is to enter into contracts with students who are in
  their last year of medical, dental, or nursing school to provide loan repayment
  assistance in return for a commitment to provide primary health services in eligible
  communities of need designated as HPSAs. The purpose of the Substance Use Disorder
  Treatment and Recovery (STAR) LRP is to recruit and retain medical, nursing, behavioral/mental
  health clinicians and paraprofessionals who provide full-time employment that involves
  direct treatment or recovery support of patients with or in recovery from a substance
  use disorder at a STAR LRP-approved facility located in either a county (or a municipality,
  if not contained within any county) where the mean drug overdose death rate per
  100,000 people over the past three years for which official data is available from
  the State, is higher than the most recent available national average overdose death
  rate per 100,000 people, as reported by the CDC, or in a designated HPSA. The purpose
  of the Pediatric Specialty LRP is to recruit and retain pediatric medical specialists,
  pediatric surgical specialists and child and adolescent mental and behavioral health
  providers who provide full-time employment in or for an approved facility serving,
  a health professional shortage area or medically underserved area, or to serve a

    \ HPSAs.\n\nThe NHSC seeks clinicians who demonstrate a commitment to serve the\
    \ Nation’s medically underserved populations at NHSC-approved sites located in\
    \ HPSAs. NHSC-approved sites provide care to individuals regardless of ability\
