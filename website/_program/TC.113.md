objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because it represents
  accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. Under current
  law, however, employer-provided educational assistance is excluded from an employee’s
  gross income, even though the employer’s costs for this assistance are a deductible
  business expense. The maximum exclusion is $5,250 per taxpayer. From March 27, 2020
  through December 31, 2025 employer-provided student loan payments are considered
  eligible educational assistance.
