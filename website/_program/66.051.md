objective: 'Section 60102 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (or IRA) amended
  the Clean Air Act by inserting section 133 (42 U.S.C. 7433) to authorize EPA’s Clean
  Ports Program (or Grants to Reduce Air Pollution at Ports) to award grants to purchase
  or install zero-emission port equipment and supporting infrastructure, serving one
  or more ports, and for climate action planning activities. IRA appropriates $3 billion
  for the program, $750 million of which must be spent on projects taking places at
  ports located in air quality areas designated pursuant to section 107 as nonattainment
  for an air pollutant. EPA’s objectives for the Clean Ports Program are to: (1) reduce
  air pollution in near-port communities, especially those with environmental justice
  concerns; (2) build a foundation for the port sector to transition over time to
  fully zero-emissions operations; and (3) help ensure that meaningful community engagement
  and emissions reduction planning are port industry standard practices.'
