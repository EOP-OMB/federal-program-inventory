objective: 'Section 60102 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (or IRA) amended
  the Clean Air Act by inserting section 133 (42 U.S.C. 7433) to authorize EPA’s Clean
  Ports Program (or Grants to Reduce Air Pollution at Ports  ) to award grants to
  purchase or install zero-emission port equipment and supporting infrastructure,
  serving one or more ports, and for climate action planning activities. IRA appropriates
  $3 billion for the program, $750 million of which must be spent on projects taking
  places at ports located in air quality areas designated pursuant to section 107
  as nonattainment for an air pollutant. EPA’s objectives for the Clean Ports Program
  are to: (1) reduce air pollution in near-port communities, especially those with
  environmental justice concerns; (2) build a foundation for the port sector to transition
  over time to fully zero-emissions operations; and (3) help ensure that meaningful
  community engagement and emissions reduction planning are port industry standard
  practices.  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2024:  EPA plans to competitively award
  funding for the deployment of zero-emission port equipment and associated infrastructure
  to reduce mobile source emissions (criteria pollutants, air toxics, and greenhouse
  gases) at U.S. ports, delivering cleaner air for communities across the country.
  EPA will also fund climate and air quality planning activities – including emissions
  inventories, strategy analysis, community engagement, and resiliency measure identification
  – to build capacity of port stakeholders to continue to reduce pollution and transition
  to zero-emissions operations over time.'
