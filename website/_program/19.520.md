objective: Funding of organizations that assist refugees and internally displaced
  persons (IDPs) in Europe and Central Asia. In the South Caucasus, the Bureau, in
  conjunction with International Organizations (IOs), non-governmental organizations
  (NGOs), and the international community, will provides life-sustaining assistance
  to the most vulnerable IDPs and refugees produced by the conflict in Georgia, Armenia,
  and Azerbaijan. In Ukraine, PRM provides critical humanitarian assistance to those
  affected by the conflict. In the Balkans, programs that support durable solutions
  are the focus of our funding, and, through international organizations, we will
  provide protection to refugees, asylum seekers, and individuals at risk for statelessness.
