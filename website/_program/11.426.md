objective: "NCCOS provides research, scientific information and tools to help balance\
  \ the Nation\u2019s ecological, social and economic goals. Our partnerships with\
  \ local and national coastal managers are essential in providing science and services\
  \ to benefit communities and the Nation. The research and tools we provide are central\
  \ to addressing coastal issues raised in legislation and NOAA\u2019s priorities.\
  \ We seek to help coastal communities protect themselves from harmful algae, contamination\
  \ and the implications of changing climate. We also provide the research necessary\
  \ for communities to develop effective and sustainable management of their resources.\
  \ Through competitive research funding, NCCOS also engages the nation\u2019s best\
  \ talent to develop cutting-edge science for coastal management applications.  NCCOS\u2019\
  s four major research priorities are: climate impacts, coastal ecosystem management,\
  \ coastal pollution, and harmful algal blooms."
