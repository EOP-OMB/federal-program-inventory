objective: 'NCCOS provides research, scientific information and tools to help balance
  the Nation’s ecological, social and economic goals. Our partnerships with local
  and national coastal managers are essential in providing science and services to
  benefit communities and the Nation. The research and tools we provide are central
  to addressing coastal issues raised in legislation and NOAA’s priorities. We seek
  to help coastal communities protect themselves from harmful algae, contamination
  and the implications of changing climate. We also provide the research necessary
  for communities to develop effective and sustainable management of their resources.
  Through competitive research funding, NCCOS also engages the nation’s best talent
  to develop cutting-edge science for coastal management applications.  NCCOS’s four
  major research priorities are: climate impacts, coastal ecosystem management, coastal
  pollution, and harmful algal blooms.'

- description: NCCOS anticipates science and science products (e.g. maps, forecasts,
    and models) to be used by coastal communities to protect themselves from harmful
    algae, water contamination, eutrophication and sea level rise and coastal storms.
    It is expected that NCCOS research will also provide critical information for
    communities to develop effective and sustainable management of their resources.
    Research efforts will lead to faster and more accurate and efficient assessment
    and monitoring of coastal ecosystems, earlier warning and more accurate forecasts
    of harmful algal bloom and pathogens, and provide tools to help communities assess
    and address their vulnerabilities to sea level rise and coastal storms.
