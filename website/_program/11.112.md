results:
- description: On average from fiscal 1997 through fiscal 2016, for every $1 that
    ITA invested in MDCP awards, the funded projects generated $339 in exports.
  year: '2016'
- description: Even though no new awards were made in fiscal 2017, there were 23 active
    MDCP projects. Recipients of MDCP awards continued to draw down award funds, which
    may be available for up to six years from the year of the award if a recipient
    receives an extension to its project period. During fiscal 2017, projects generated
    $363 million in exports.
  year: '2017'
- description: MDCP is not called out in ITA's appropriation, so ITA funds MDCP competitions
    from its base. Although ITA lacked such base funding for new MDCP awards in fiscal
    2019, during fiscal 2019 ITA continued to cooperate on 15 active MDCP projects
    under awards made in fiscal years prior to 2017. During the first two quarters
    of fiscal 2019, projects had generated $27 million in exports.
  year: '2018'
- description: TMA BlueTech, a marine technology trade association, received MDCP
    financial and technical support from 2016 through 2020. The assistance from the
    International Trade Administration (ITA) enabled TMA BlueTech to help its member
    companies get connected to potential international buyers through trade missions
    abroad and export counseling. One example is Hydronalix, an Arizona-based start-up
    that manufactures robot water rescue devices and marine survey equipment. The
    ITA/MDCP help has enabled Hydronalix to acquire a distributor in the Netherlands
    and log over $3 million in export sales to that market.
  year: '2019'
- description: ASABE and its partner, the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA)
    have led the U.S. feed machinery’s participation in ISO international standardization
    efforts initiated by China. With regard to terminology for the standardization
    work, U.S. experts recruited by ASABE and AFIA reined in China’s initial proposal
    for 961 terms to be included. These terms are not all essential to feed machinery
    safety and design and would have been challenging for producers to follow. They
    were intended, by their volume, to overwhelm the scrutiny of delegates from other
    countries participating in the standardization process, thereby shaping the process
    to China’s advantage. If accepted into the international standard, they would
    have created unfair and unnecessary requirements for U.S. exporters. Through ITA’s
    MDCP support of ASABE and AFIA, U.S. experts were able to come to consensus with
    China and reduce this number to approximately 39 terms.

- description: 'New Plumbing Code and Lab Leads to Tripling of Exports

    IAPMO, a U.S.-based standards developing organization, leveraged an MDCP award
    from ITA to establish lab in Indonesia to certify that plumbing products comply
    with Indonesia’s plumbing code. With Indonesia’s newly adopted national plumbing
    standard, SNI 8153:2015, the lab certification of plumbing products allows architects,
    planners, builders, and building owners the certainty they need to choose the
    right products for the right applications, including products made in the United
    States. Between 2016 and 2017, the year that both the new code and the lab were
    in placed, U.S. exports to Indonesia tripled.'

- description: On average, MDCP projects generate $286 in exports for every $1 of  ITA
    funding.
  year: '2022'
- description: 'In 2020, ITA awarded Auto Care Association a $299,000 Market Development
    Cooperator Program (MDCP) grant to promote the adoption and implementation in
    key Latin American markets of auto parts cataloging standards used commonly by
    U.S. firms. Auto Care recently announced that such standards are now adopted by
    two key marketplaces in Colombia, Imotriz and Mercado Libre, the largest auto-parts
    marketplace in Latin America.



    Under its MDCP cooperative agreement with ITA, Auto Care has coordinated closely
    with specialists in ITA’s Industry & Analysis unit as well as with ITA’s Global
    Markets/Commercial Service staff in Bogota and other major cities in Latin America.
    The education effort convinced Imotriz and Mercado Libre that, for digitalization
    and e-commerce, standards used commonly by U.S. automotive aftermarket firms are
    the best solution. Jorge Mario Ortiz, CEO, Imotriz, noted that “By adopting the
    Auto Care Association’s data standards, we are making it easier for our customers
    to find the products they need and for our suppliers to reach a wider audience.”



    As the Colombian distribution system begins to primarily use the Auto Care standards,
    U.S. auto parts companies will find it easier to export to customers in Colombia.'
