objective: "The objective of the Glovebox Manufacturing Expansion Initiative cooperative\
  \ agreement is to support investments in facility expansion and equipment modernization\
  \ of commercial facilities in the United States for the front- and back-end fabrication\
  \ of Nuclear Quality Assurance (NQA-1) or International Organization for Standardization\
  \ (ISO) 9001 nuclear gloveboxes. \nTo meet its mission, “to protect the Nation,\
  \ our allies and our partners by providing a resilient and responsive Nuclear Security\
  \ Enterprise,” the DOE\\NNSA must rely on commercial manufacturers to help meet\
  \ important mission objectives. In late 2022, the DOE\\NNSA determined the need\
  \ to ensure a sufficient supply of nuclear capable gloveboxes is available for necessary\
  \ capital projects and equipment replacements and installations within designated\
  \ facilities. After extensive market research, the DOE/NNSA is working to coordinate\
  \ efforts of federal management & operating (M&O) partners across technical, fiscal,\
  \ contracting, and industrial base domains to create a coherent approach that uses\
  \ all levers to meet prioritized mission requirements and support the nuclear security\
  \ enterprise. \nFunding will support investments in facility expansion and equipment\
  \ modernization of commercial facilities in the United States for the front- and\
  \ back-end fabrication of Nuclear Quality Assurance (NQA-1) or International Organization\
  \ Standardization (ISO) 9001 nuclear gloveboxes.   Applications must identify achievable\
  \ expansion goals to increase current nuclear glovebox manufacturing capacity no\
  \ later than December 31, 2027.\nApplicants should be prepared to show how facility\
  \ expansion and/or equipment purchases will increase (at least double) their manufacturing\
  \ capability. Multiple metrics may be appropriate. Applicants should estimate benefits\
  \ in their applications and appendices using the same metrics which they intend\
  \ to measure success. \nImplemented cooperative agreements will be monitored through\
  \ reporting and within two years of granted funding, a review of efforts will be\
  \ completed, and an assessment made if funding should continue."
