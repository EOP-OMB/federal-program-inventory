objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code allows credits
  for the production of clean hydrogen. Clean hydrogen is defined in relation to its
  lifecycle greenhouse has emissions rate; no credit is allowed for hydrogen with
  a lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate greater than 4 kilogram of carbon dioxide
  equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen. The credit applies to qualified clean hydrogen
  produced at a qualified clean hydrogen production facility during the 10-year period
  beginning on the date such facility was originally placed in service. Qualifying
  facilities must be placed in service before December 31, 2033.
