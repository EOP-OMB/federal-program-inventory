  \ recover and assist missing and exploited children, including victims of online\
  \ and/or  commercial sexual exploitation.  \n2)\tEstablish and maintain a national\
  \ resource center and clearinghouse dedicated to missing and exploited children\
  \ issues.\n3)\tSupport the AMBER Alert program, through training and technical assistance\
  \ grants to enhance partnership between law-enforcement agencies, broadcasters,\
  \ transportation agencies, and the wireless industry, to activate urgent bulletins\
  \ in child-abduction cases.\n\nObjective(s): Objective to Goal 1\n(1) Support enhancements\
  \ to law enforcement’s investigative responses to missing and exploited children\
  \ issues through programs and activities (e.g., the Internet Crimes Against Children\
  \ Task Force Program), (2) support Missing Children's Day activities, programs focused\
  \ on the online and/or commercial sexual exploitation of children, and the Supporting\
  \ Effective Interventions for Youth with Problematic or Illegal Sexual Behavior\
  \  program and (3) develop training programs for law enforcement, child protective\
  \ services, medical personnel, and prosecutors to enhance coordination and effectiveness\
  \ of missing and exploited children investigations and to enhance the overall system\
  \ response, and (4) identify gaps in areas of interstate   travel (such as borders,\
  \ ports, checkpoints) and develop programs to meet specialized needs of parents\
  \ or guardians of children who are reported missing.\n\nObjective to Goal 2\n(1)\
  \ Provide a toll-free hotline where citizens can report investigative leads and\
  \ parents and other interested individuals can receive information concerning missing\
  \ children; (2) provide technical assistance as well as trainings to parents, law\
  \ enforcement, and other professionals working on missing and exploited children\
  \ cases; (3) promote information sharing and provide technical assistance by encouraging\

  \ that contain practical, timely information about supporting missing and exploited\
  \ children issues; and (5) provide information regarding programs offering free\
  \ or low-cost transportation services that assist in reuniting children with their\
  \ families. \n\nObjective to Goal 3\n\nDOJ is not responsible for the decision to\
  \ release individual AMBER Alerts, but rather OJP uses these  funds to support the\
  \ AMBER Alert Training and Technical Assistance Center to increase the capacity\
  \ of law enforcement to respond to missing, endangered, and abducted children including\
  \ continued efforts to increase capacity within territories and American Indian/Alaska\
  \ Native communities to respond to incidents of endangered, missing, and abducted\
  \ children cases  and (2) to increase the number of AMBER Alert plans developed\

  \ of technical assistance requests delivered\nPM 2: Percentage of organizations\
  \ who employed a new evidence-based or promising service, policy, or practice recommended\
