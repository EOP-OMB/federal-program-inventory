objective: Stewardship End Result Contracting authorizes use of contracts and agreements
  to help achieve land management goals while meeting local and rural community needs,
  including contributing to the sustainability of rural communities and providing
  a continuing source of local income and employment. It focuses on the “end result”
  ecosystem benefits and outcomes, rather than on what's removed from the land.
