objective: The Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration
  will provide federal funding for grants to eligible entities for broadband planning,
  deployment, mapping, equity, and adoption projects.  The BEAD program will first
  focus on deploying broadband service to unserved areas, those without any broadband
  service at all or with slow speeds. The program will prioritize projects designed
  to provide fiber connectivity directly to the end user. It also will prioritize
  proposals that include affordability commitments to ensure that networks built using
  taxpayer dollars are accessible to all Americans.  The BEAD Program next will focus
  on provision of broadband to underserved areas—those that have access to broadband
  service of at least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream but less than 100 Mbps downstream/20
  Mbps upstream, again prioritizing fiber services that are both fast enough to accommodate
  Americans’ future needs and affordable.  To the extent an eligible entity has funds
  leftover after meeting these two statutory priorities, funds will be allotted to
  connect community anchor institutions such as libraries and community centers that
  lack a 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) connection.
