objective: "The Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information\
  \ Administration will provide federal funding for grants to eligible entities for\
  \ broadband planning, deployment, mapping, equity, and adoption projects.  The BEAD\
  \ program will first focus on deploying broadband service to unserved areas, those\
  \ without any broadband service at all or with slow speeds. The program will prioritize\
  \ projects designed to provide fiber connectivity directly to the end user. It also\
  \ will prioritize proposals that include affordability commitments to ensure that\
  \ networks built using taxpayer dollars are accessible to all Americans.  The BEAD\
  \ Program next will focus on provision of broadband to underserved areas\u2014those\
  \ that have access to broadband service of at least 25 Mbps downstream/3 Mbps upstream\
  \ but less than 100 Mbps downstream/20 Mbps upstream, again prioritizing fiber services\
  \ that are both fast enough to accommodate Americans\u2019 future needs and affordable.\
  \  To the extent an eligible entity has funds leftover after meeting these two statutory\
  \ priorities, funds will be allotted to connect community anchor institutions such\
  \ as libraries and community centers that lack a 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) connection."
