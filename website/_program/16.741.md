  \ government to increase laboratory capacity and reduce the number of samples awaiting\
  \ analysis in both the casework and database sections.\n\nObjective:  To assist\
  \ eligible States and units of local government to process, record, screen, and\
  \ analyze forensic DNA  and/or DNA database samples to increase the capacity of\
  \ public forensic DNA and DNA database laboratories to process more DNA samples,\
  \ thereby helping to reduce the number of forensic DNA and DNA database samples\
  \ awaiting analysis.\n\nThe Formula DNA CEBR Program awards funding to eligible\
  \ entities with two main program objectives:\n1. Increase the number of CODIS-eligible\
  \ samples analyzed in forensic DNA and DNA database laboratories.\n2. Reduce the\
  \ forensic case and DNA database sample turnaround times for CODIS entry.\n\nPerformance\
  \ Measure 1: Number of DNA profile uploads into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS);\
  \ and,  \n\nPerformance Measure 2: Number of cases completed since the beginning\
  \ of the grant period."
