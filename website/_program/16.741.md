objective: "Program now funded under Assistance Listing 16.036. \n\nGoal(s):  The\
  \ goal is to assist eligible States and units of local government to increase laboratory\
  \ capacity and reduce the number of samples awaiting analysis in both the casework\
  \ and database sections.\n\nObjective:  To assist eligible States and units of local\
  \ government to process, record, screen, and analyze forensic DNA  and/or DNA database\
  \ samples to increase the capacity of public forensic DNA and DNA database laboratories\
  \ to process more DNA samples, thereby helping to reduce the number of forensic\
  \ DNA and DNA database samples awaiting analysis.\n\nThe Formula DNA CEBR Program\
  \ awards funding to eligible entities with two main program objectives:\n1. Increase\
  \ the number of CODIS-eligible samples analyzed in forensic DNA and DNA database\
  \ laboratories.\n2. Reduce the forensic case and DNA database sample turnaround\
  \ times for CODIS entry.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Number of DNA profile uploads\
  \ into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS); and,  \n\nPerformance Measure 2: Number\
  \ of cases completed since the beginning of the grant period."
