objective: "The objective of the OSG Program is to award grants to the states, the\
  \ District of Columbia, and U.S. territories for the purpose of providing grants\
  \ to a municipality or municipal entity for the planning, design, or construction\
  \ of: 1) treatment works to intercept, transport, control, treat, or reuse municipal\
  \ combined sewer overflows (CSOs), sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs), or stormwater;\
  \ and 2) any other measures to manage, reduce, treat, or recapture stormwater or\
  \ subsurface drainage water.\n\nFunding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  State recipients\
  \ shall provide funding to municipalities based on the following priorities: 1.\
  \ financially distressed communities that meet the affordability criteria established\
  \ by the state; 2. implementing a long-term control plan for CSOs or SSOs; 3. requesting\
  \ funds for a project included on a state\u2019s Intended Use Plan for the Clean\
  \ Water State Revolving Fund; or 4. an Alaskan Native Village. State recipients\
  \ may select which priorities from this list are most relevant for their program\
  \ when determining which municipalities to fund. Furthermore, to the extent there\
  \ are sufficient eligible project applications, at least 20% of a state\u2019s allocation\
  \ must be used for green infrastructure, water and energy efficiency improvements,\
  \ or other environmentally innovative activities. To the extent there are sufficient\
  \ eligible project applications, a State shall use not less than 25 percent of their\
  \ allocation amount to carry out projects in rural communities or financially distressed\
  \ communities. Of this 25 percent amount, at least 60 percent of this amount should\
  \ go toward rural communities (Population of 10,000 or less).\n\nFunding Priorities\
  \ - Fiscal Year 2024: State recipients shall continue to provide funding to municipalities\
  \ based on the following priorities: 1. financially distressed communities that\
  \ meet the affordability criteria established by the state; 2. implementing a long-term\
  \ control plan for CSOs or SSOs; 3. requesting funds for a project included on a\
  \ state\u2019s Intended Use Plan for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund; or 4.\
  \ an Alaskan Native Village. State recipients may select which priorities from this\
  \ list are most relevant for their program when determining which municipalities\
  \ to fund. Furthermore, to the extent there are sufficient eligible project applications,\
  \ at least 20% of a state\u2019s allocation must be used for green infrastructure,\
  \ water and energy efficiency improvements, or other environmentally innovative\
  \ activities. To the extent there are sufficient eligible project applications,\
  \ a State shall use not less than 25 percent of their allocation amount to carry\
  \ out projects in rural communities or financially distressed communities. Of this\
  \ 25 percent amount, at least 60 percent of this amount should go toward rural communities\
