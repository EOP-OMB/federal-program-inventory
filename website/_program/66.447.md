objective: 'The objective of the OSG Program is to award grants to the states, the
  District of Columbia, and U.S. territories for the purpose of providing grants to
  a municipality or municipal entity for the planning, design, or construction of:
  1) treatment works to intercept, transport, control, treat, or reuse municipal combined
  sewer overflows (CSOs), sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs), or stormwater; and 2) any
  other measures to manage, reduce, treat, or recapture stormwater or subsurface drainage
  water. State recipients shall continue to provide funding to municipalities based
  on the following priorities: 1. financially distressed communities that meet the
  affordability criteria established by the state; 2. implementing a long-term control
  plan for CSOs or SSOs; 3. requesting funds for a project included on a state’s Intended
  Use Plan for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund; or 4. an Alaskan Native Village.
  State recipients may select which priorities from this list are most relevant for
  their program when determining which municipalities to fund. Furthermore, to the
  extent there are sufficient eligible project applications, at least 20% of a state’s
  allocation must be used for green infrastructure, water and energy efficiency improvements,
  or other environmentally innovative activities. To the extent there are sufficient
  eligible project applications, a State shall use not less than 25 percent of their
  allocation amount to carry out projects in rural communities or financially distressed
  communities. Of this 25 percent amount, at least 60 percent of this amount should
  go toward rural communities (Population of 10,000 or less).'
