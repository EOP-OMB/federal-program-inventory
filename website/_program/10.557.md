objective: To provide income-eligible pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women,
  infants, and children up to age five who are determined to be at nutritional risk
  with supplemental nutritious foods, nutrition education, and referrals to health
  and social services at no cost. WIC also promotes and supports breastfeeding as
  the feeding method of choice for infants, provides substance abuse education and
  promotes immunization and other aspects of healthy living. For Formula Grants, the
  Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) makes funds available to participating State health
  agencies and Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) that, in turn, distribute the funds
  to participating local agencies. State and local agencies use WIC funds to pay the
  costs of specified supplemental foods provided to WIC participants, and to pay for
  specified nutrition services and administration (NSA) costs, including the cost
  of nutrition assessments, blood tests for anemia, nutrition education, breastfeeding
  promotion and support, and health care referrals. For Project Grants, FNS makes
  funding available to carry out WIC outreach, innovation, and program modernization
  efforts to increase participation and redemption of benefits. Projects may focus
  on reducing disparities in program delivery, improving WIC service delivery, improving
  the WIC shopping experience, and increasing awareness of the Program’s benefits
  and services.
