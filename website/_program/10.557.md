objective: "To provide low-income pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women, infants,\
  \ and children up to age five who are determined to be at nutritional risk with\
  \ supplemental nutritious foods, nutrition education, and referrals to health and\
  \ social services at no cost. WIC also promotes and supports breastfeeding as the\
  \ feeding method of choice for infants, provides substance abuse education and promotes\
  \ immunization and other aspects of healthy living. For Formula Grants, the Food\
  \ and Nutrition Service (FNS) makes funds available to participating State health\
  \ agencies and Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) that, in turn, distribute the\
  \ funds to participating local agencies. State and local agencies use WIC funds\
  \ to pay the costs of specified supplemental foods provided to WIC participants,\
  \ and to pay for specified nutrition services and administration (NSA) costs, including\
  \ the cost of nutrition assessments, blood tests for anemia, nutrition education,\
  \ breastfeeding promotion and support, and health care referrals. For Project Grants,\
  \ FNS makes funding available to carry out WIC outreach, innovation, and program\
  \ modernization efforts to increase participation and redemption of benefits. Projects\
  \ may focus on reducing disparities in program delivery, improving WIC service delivery,\
  \ improving the WIC shopping experience, and increasing awareness of the Program\u2019\
  s benefits and services."
