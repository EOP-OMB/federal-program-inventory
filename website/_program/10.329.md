objective: NIFA requests applications for the Crop Protection and Pest Management
  (CPPM) program for fiscal year (FY) 2023 to address critical state, regional and
  national integrated pest management (IPM) needs to ensure food security and respond
  effectively to other major societal pest management challenges. The CPPM program
  supports projects that address these challenges with IPM approaches developed by
  coordinated state, regional, and national research, and extension efforts. The impact
  of these research and extension efforts will be increased by the establishment of
  communication networks and stakeholder participation in setting priorities. In FY
  2023, NIFA will only accept competitive applications for funding in the Applied
  Research and Development Program (ARDP) program area. NIFA will fund current Extension
  Implementation Program (EIP) and Regional Coordination Program (RCP) areas of the
  CPPM program through continuation applications.
