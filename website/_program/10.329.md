objective: "The purpose of the Crop Protection and Pest Management (CPPM) program\
  \ (Assistance Listing \n10.329) is to provide funding for integrated, multifunctional\
  \ agricultural research, extension, and \neducation activities. The goals and objectives\
  \ of CPPM are to address high priority issues related \nto pests including insects,\
  \ nematodes, pathogens, weeds, and other pests and their management \nusing integrated\
  \ pest management (IPM) approaches at the state, regional and national levels. The\
  \ \nCPPM program supports projects that will ensure sustainable food production\
  \ and respond \neffectively to other major societal pest management challenges with\
  \ comprehensive IPM \napproaches that are economically viable, ecologically prudent,\
  \ and safe for human health. In \naddition, the CPPM program encourages proposals\
  \ that develop new IPM strategies and tools to \nmitigate the effects of existing\
  \ or new pests becoming more prevalent due to climate change. \nProposals that address\
  \ management aspects of invasive species are prioritized as well. The CPPM \nprogram\
  \ also addresses IPM challenges for emerging issues and existing priority pest concerns\
  \ \nthat can be addressed more effectively with new and emerging technologies. The\
  \ outcomes of the \nCPPM program are effective, affordable, and environmentally\
  \ sound IPM practices and strategies \nneeded to maintain agricultural productivity\
  \ and healthy communities."
