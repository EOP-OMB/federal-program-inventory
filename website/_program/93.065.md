objective: This program will increase the capacity and capability of state and territorial
  newborn screening laboratories to test for newborn screening conditions as recommended
  by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Advisory Committee on
  Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC), and those that might be added
  to individual state panels by state-level advisory committees or state legislatures.
  Early detection of these conditions, whose symptoms are not clinically observable
  at birth, save thousands of infants and children from disability and death through
  early detection and treatment.
