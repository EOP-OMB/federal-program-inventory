objective: To provide opportunities for communities to establish or expand activities
  in community learning centers that provide opportunities for academic enrichment
  for children, particularly students who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools.
  The program is intended to help students meet state and local student academic achievement
  standards in core academic subjects, such as reading and math; to offer students
  a broad array of enrichment activities that reinforce and complement their regular
  academic programs; and to offer literacy and other educational services to the families
  of participating children.
