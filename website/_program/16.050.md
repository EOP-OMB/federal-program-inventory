objective: 'Administered by the Office of Justice Programs’ (OJP) Bureau of Justice
  Assistance (BJA), the Missing and Unidentified Human Remains (MUHR) Program provides
  funds to enable eligible entities to improve the reporting, transportation, forensic
  testing, and identification of missing persons and unidentified human remains, including
  migrants. This program furthers the U.S. Department of Justice’s mission of increasing
  public safety by providing resources to locate and identify missing persons and
  unidentified human remains in the United States. The MUHR Program augments and complements
  the services available through the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), National Institute
  of Justice National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) Program. NamUs
  is a free, national, centralized repository and resource center for cases involving
  missing persons, unidentified human remains, and unclaimed persons. The MUHR Program
  fills a gap in the national field by providing federal resources directly to state
  and local jurisdictions. As a result, the MUHR Program helps jurisdictions become
  more self-sufficient in reducing their backlog of missing persons and unidentified
  human remains cases.


  Performance Measure 1:  The number of missing persons cases (including migrants)
  processed (all purpose areas); and,


  Performance Measure 2:  The number of unidentified human remains cases (including
  migrants) processed (all purpose areas).'
