objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code allows credits
  for plug-in electric-drive motor vehicles, alternative fuel vehicle refueling property,
  two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles, and fuel cell motor vehicles. These provisions,
  except for the plug-in electric-drive motor vehicle credit, expired after December
  31, 2017.
