objective: "Brownfield sites are real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse\
  \ of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous\
  \ substance, pollutant, or contaminant. \n\nJob Training Grants allow nonprofits,\
  \ local governments, and other eligible organizations to provide environmental training\
  \ for residents impacted by brownfield sites in their communities. Brownfields Job\
  \ Training Coalition grants are designed for one “lead” eligible entity to partner\
  \ with one or more eligible entities that do not have the capacity to apply for\
  \ and manage their own EPA cooperative agreement and otherwise would not have access\
  \ to Brownfields Grant resources. An eligible entity (either as an individual applicant\
  \ or as the lead coalition member) may request up to $500,000 for up to a 5-year\
  \ performance period). These grants allow eligible entities to recruit, train, and\
  \ place unemployed and underemployed residents of areas affected by the presence\
  \ of brownfield sites. Grant recipients can allocate up to 40% of the total award\
  \ for participant support costs related to transportation for trainees, childcare,\
  \ and compensation for trainees to participate in the training. A critical part\
  \ of the Brownfields Job Training program is to further environmental justice by\
  \ ensuring that all residents living in communities historically affected by economic\
  \ disinvestment, health disparities, and disproportionate and adverse exposures\
  \ to environmental contamination, which may include low-income, minority, Tribal\
  \ and Indigenous communities, have an opportunity to reap the benefits of revitalization\
  \ and environmental cleanup. This program builds strong partnerships and local capacity\
  \ to assess, safely clean up, and sustainably reuse brownfield sites.\n\nJob Training\
  \ Grants may be funded under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Recipients\
  \ will be required to report program accomplishments for IIJA-funded activities\
  \ in the Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment, Exchange System (ACRES) and collected\
  \ data will be used to demonstrate successful implementation of the program. EPA\
  \ intends to use this grant opportunity to support the creation of good-paying jobs\
  \ with the free and fair choice to join a union and the incorporation of strong\
  \ labor standards and workforce programs, in particular Registered Apprenticeship\
  \ Programs, pre-apprenticeship programs (that have a direct connection to a Registered\
  \ Apprenticeship Program), Labor-Management Partnerships, partnerships with community\
  \ colleges, Local Hire agreements in project planning stages to the extent authorized\
  \ by 2 CFR § 200.319, and program delivery and similar proven workforce training\
  \ programs."

- description: To date, EPA has funded 414 job training grants totaling approximately
    $105.5 million through the Brownfields Job Training Program, previously also known
    as the Environmental Workforce Job Development Training Program. As of March 2024,
    approximately 21,700 individuals have completed training, and over 16,200 of those
    graduates obtained employment in the environmental field, earning average starting
    wages of over $15 per hour. Over the last 5 years, the average starting wage was
    approximately $21 per hour. This equates to a cumulative placement rate of approximately
    75% since the program was created in 1998.
