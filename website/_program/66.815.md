objective: The objective of the Brownfields Job Training Program is to recruit, train,
  and place unemployed and under-employed residents of solid and hazardous waste-impacted
  communities with the skills needed to obtain full-time, sustainable employment.
  This program promotes the facilitation of activities related to assessment, cleanup,
  or preparation of contaminated sites, including brownfields, for reuse, while simultaneously
  building a local workforce with the skills needed to perform remediation work that
  are supportive of environmental protection and environmental health and safety.
  For FY24, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds will support approximately 24 cooperative
  agreements (estimated $12 million) that recipients may use to develop training programs
  to recruit, train, and place unemployed and under-employed residents of solid and
  hazardous waste-impacted communities with the skills needed to obtain full-time,
  sustainable employment in various activities related to the assessment, cleanup,
  remediation, and revitalization of brownfield sites.
