objective: Under the baseline tax system, expenses incurred in earning income would
  be deductible. However, such expenses would not be deductible when the income or
  the return on an investment is not taxed. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion
  from a taxpayer’s taxable income for the value of owner-occupied housing services
  and also allows the owner-occupant to deduct mortgage interest paid on his or her
  primary residence and one secondary residence as an itemized non-business deduction.
  In general, the mortgage interest deduction is limited to interest on debt no greater
  than the owner’s basis in the residence, and is also limited to interest on debt
  of no more than $1 million. Interest on up to $100,000 of other debt secured by
  a lien on a principal or second residence is also deductible, irrespective of the
  purpose of borrowing, provided the total debt does not exceed the fair market value
  of the residence. As an alternative to the deduction, holders of qualified Mortgage
  Credit Certificates issued by State or local governmental units or agencies may
  claim a tax credit equal to a proportion of their interest expense. In the case
  of taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026,
  (1) the $1 million limit is reduced to $750,000 for indebtedness incurred after
  December 15, 2017, and (2) the deduction for interest on home equity indebtedness
  is disallowed.
