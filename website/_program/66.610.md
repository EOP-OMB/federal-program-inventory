objective: 'The goals of these assistance programs are to: (1) support surveys, studies,
  investigations, and special purpose assistance associated with air quality, acid
  deposition, drinking water, water quality, hazardous waste, toxic substances and/or
  pesticides; (2) identify, develop, and demonstrate necessary pollution control techniques;
  (3) prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution; (4) evaluate the economic and social
  consequences of alternative strategies and mechanisms for use by those in economic,
  social, governmental, and environmental management positions; and (5) Support includes
  research, investigation, studies, training, demonstration, information dissemination,
  and technical assistance to states.  In FY 2025 the Environmental Council of the
  States (ECOS) will work closely with the EPA as co-regulators through the jointly
  governed Combined Air Emissions Reporting (CAERS) Product Design Team (PDT) established
  under E-Enterprise for the Environment. States will continue to use this existing
  forum to share information with EPA and ensure that state interests, needs, and
  issues are adequately addressed by the CAERS project. ECOS will work in close cooperation
  with the chairs and members of the CAERS Product Development Team (PDT) to plan
  and execute this work and increase the value of CAERS for states interested in onboarding.
  ECOS will conduct research to better understand the extent of alignment among data
  fields used by states, locals, tribes, (SLTs) and EPA relevant to source tests for
  the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). The research will
  investigate which SLT-specific programs require source test data reporting from
  their industry for their emissions inventory. Researchers will seek to document
  how states intake and/or use source test data reports from industry at the facility
  and unit/process levels for use in emission inventories where “stack test” is the
  calculation method. ECOS will support work with state environmental agencies through
  the ECOS Water Committee to convene the appropriate state environmental leaders
  to work on water issues, improve communication and partnership with EPA, and coordinate
  with other state water associations. ECOS will especially seek to support states
  in engaging in the robust regulatory agenda being pursued by the Office of Water
  and help coordinate partnership on those topics between states and EPA. ECOS will
  support EPA in moving forward with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
  implementation and priorities like Justice40 as they relate to the State Revolving
  Fund programs. Advance the ECOS Member priority to support small and disadvantaged
  systems. Support the ECOS Infrastructure Workgroup. ECOS intends to bring states
  together through the Climate and Energy Workgroup to discuss with EPA the implications,
  opportunities, and challenges for states. Input from ECOS and its members will help
  EPA shape durable and equitable climate solutions. ECOS staff will also track the
  work of EPA and other relevant federal agencies as they open financial and technical
  assistance opportunities to states related to climate and energy aspects of American
  Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), IIJA, and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). ECOS will share
  this information with state environmental agencies to help states seize the opportunities
  that are being made available through these laws. ECOS will facilitate state engagement
  and input on PFAS challenges and the PFAS Roadmap: Convene state and EPA leaders
  and experts to advance coordinated efforts on shared challenges such as PFAS in
  biosolids, implementing an enforceable drinking water standard, and regulating PFAS
  as hazardous, among other concerns, and to continue to conduct dialogue on the PFAS
  Roadmap to ensure effective implementation and co-regulation. ECOS will continue
  to provide ongoing support in managing the regular/monthly ECOS EJ Workgroup and
  the ECOS EJ Workgroup Steering Committee meetings, coordinating with EPA leadership
  and other federal partners, organizing and facilitating discussions, compiling and
  disseminating information, developing resources, and/or any other additional actions
  as needed.'
