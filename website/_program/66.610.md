objective: "The goals of these assistance programs are to: (1) support surveys, studies,\
  \ investigations, and special purpose assistance associated with air quality, acid\
  \ deposition, drinking water, water quality, hazardous waste, toxic substances and/or\
  \ pesticides; (2) identify, develop, and demonstrate necessary pollution control\
  \ techniques; (3) prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution; (4) evaluate the economic\
  \ and social consequences of alternative strategies and mechanisms for use by those\
  \ in economic, social, governmental, and environmental management positions; and\
  \ (5) Support includes research, investigation, studies, training, demonstration,\
  \ information dissemination, and technical assistance to states.  Funding Priorities\
  \ - Fiscal Year 2023: The Environmental Council of the States (ECOS) will be working\
  \ closely with the EPA as co-regulators through the jointly governed Combined Air\
  \ Emissions Reporting (CAERS) Product Design Team (PDT) established under E-Enterprise\
  \ for the Environment. States will continue to use this existing forum to share\
  \ information with EPA and ensure that state interests, needs, and issues are adequately\
  \ addressed by the CAERS project. ECOS will work in close cooperation with the chairs\
  \ and members of the CAERS Product Development Team (PDT) to plan and execute this\
  \ work and increase the value of CAERS for states interested in onboarding. ECOS\
  \ will conduct research to better understand the extent of alignment among data\
  \ fields used by states, locals, tribes, (SLTs) and EPA relevant to source tests\
  \ for the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). The research\
  \ will investigate which SLT-specific programs require source test data reporting\
  \ from their industry for their emissions inventory. Researchers will seek to document\
  \ how states intake and/or use source test data reports from industry at the facility\
  \ and unit/process levels for use in emission inventories where \u201Cstack test\u201D\
  \ is the calculation method. ECOS will support work with state environmental agencies\
  \ through the ECOS Water Committee to convene the appropriate state environmental\
  \ leaders to work on water issues, improve communication and partnership with EPA,\
  \ and coordinate with other state water associations. ECOS will especially seek\
  \ to support states in engaging in the robust regulatory agenda being pursued by\
  \ the Office of Water and help coordinate partnership on those topics between states\
  \ and EPA. ECOS will support EPA in moving forward with Infrastructure Investment\
  \ and Jobs Act (IIJA) implementation and priorities like Justice40 as they relate\
  \ to the State Revolving Fund programs. Advance the ECOS Member priority to support\
  \ small and disadvantaged systems. Support the ECOS Infrastructure Workgroup. ECOS\
  \ intends to bring states together through the Climate and Energy Workgroup to discuss\
  \ with EPA the implications, opportunities, and challenges for states. Input from\
  \ ECOS and its members will help EPA shape durable and equitable climate solutions.\
  \ ECOS staff will also track the work of EPA and other relevant federal agencies\
  \ as they open financial and technical assistance opportunities to states related\
  \ to climate and energy aspects of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), IIJA, and Inflation\
  \ Reduction Act (IRA). ECOS will share this information with state environmental\
  \ agencies to help states seize the opportunities that are being made available\
  \ through these laws. ECOS will facilitate state engagement and input on PFAS challenges\
  \ and the PFAS Roadmap: Convene state and EPA leaders and experts to advance coordinated\
  \ efforts on shared challenges such as PFAS in biosolids, implementing a federally-enforceable\
  \ drinking water standard, and regulating PFAS as hazardous, among other concerns,\
  \ and to continue to conduct dialogue on the PFAS Roadmap to ensure effective implementation\
  \ and co-regulation. ECOS will continue to provide ongoing support in managing the\
  \ regular/monthly ECOS EJ Workgroup and the ECOS EJ Workgroup Steering Committee\
  \ meetings, coordinating with EPA leadership and other federal partners, organizing\
  \ and facilitating discussions, compiling and disseminating information, developing\
  \ resources, and/or any other additional actions as needed."
