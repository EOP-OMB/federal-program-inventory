  \ funding for schools and roads that supplements other available funds.\n\n•\tTitle\
  \ II - Special Projects on Federal Land: To make additional investments in, and\
  \ create additional employment opportunities through, projects that improve the\
  \ maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement stewardship objectives that\

  \ funding for schools and roads that supplements other available funds.\n\nThis\

    program will continue its efforts to invest in and create additional employment
    opportunities through projects that improve the maintenance of existing infrastructure,

    improve land health and water quality. Simultaneously, the projects improve cooperative
    relationships among the people that use and care for Federal lands and the agencies
    that manage these lands. Since the implementation of this program in fiscal year
    2002, the Resource Advisory Committees have recommended over 1500 projects that
    were subsequently approved by the Designated Federal Officials. Many of the projects
    are multi-year projects that are funded in phases and implemented over several
    years.
