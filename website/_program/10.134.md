objective: The purpose of the Oriental Fruit Fly Program is to provide direct payments
  to eligible agriculture producers in Miami-Dade County who suffered a revenue loss
  in 2015 and/or 2016 due to a State of Florida and APHIS implemented quarantine,
  because there was an outbreak of Oriental Fruit Flies that damaged fruits and vegetables
  in Miami-Dade County. The quarantine, which lasted from August 28, 2015, through
  February 13, 2016, was necessary and successful in eradicating the Oriental Fruit
  Fly. Because the Non-Insured Crop Assistance Program (NAP) does not apply in instances
  of a state or federally declared quarantine and RMA does not offer a quarantine
  endorsement in Florida, the affected producers in Miami-Dade County needed relief.
