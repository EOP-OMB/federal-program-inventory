objective: "The detection of multiple oriental flies triggered the State of Florida\
  \ and Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service (APHIS) to implement a quarantine\
  \ in Miami-Dade- County on August 28, 2015. The Oriental Fruit Fly (OFF) is considered\
  \ one of the most serious of the world\u2019s fruit fly pests and attacks fruits,\
  \ vegetables, and nuts. On February 13, 2016, APHIS rescinded the quarantine after\
  \ three lifecycles elapsed without any new oriental fruit fly detections. The OFF\
  \ program provides direct financial assistance to agriculture producers who suffered\
  \ a loss of revenue for calendar year(s) 2015 and/or 2016 due to the APHIS imposed\
  \ OFF Quarantine in Miami-Dade County, FL that occurred August 28, 2015 through\
  \ February 13, 2016. OFF program payments were made to eligible producers during\
  \ the week of May 12, 2022."
