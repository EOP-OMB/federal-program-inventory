- description: In 2024, the National Center for Appropriate Technology’s (NCAT) Appropriate
    Technology Transfer for Rural Areas (ATTRA) program achieved several notable milestones
    in promoting sustainable agriculture. It expanded its AgriSolar Clearinghouse,
    which connects stakeholders in agrivoltaics—integrating solar installations with
    agricultural uses—to improve land use efficiency and ecosystem services. Additionally,
    ATTRA supported over 300 beginning farmers and ranchers across the Northern Great
    Plains through its Preparing a Resilient Future project, helping them explore
    organic production’s economic and environmental benefits. The program also hosted
    events like the Latino Farmer Conference, providing culturally relevant resources
    and training to underrepresented farmers.
