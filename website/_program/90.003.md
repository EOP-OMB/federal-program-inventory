- text: 'Denali Commission Act of 1998, Public Law 150-277, 42 US Cods 3121, The Denali
    Commission Act of 1998 established the Denali Commission (Commission) to deliver
    services of the federal government in the most cost-effective manner by reducing
    administrative and overhead costs. As part of the act, the Commissionâ€™s mission
    of providing job training and other economic development services in rural communities
    was established with a specific focus on promoting rural development, and providing
    power generation, transition facilities, modern communication systems, water and
    sewer systems and other infrastructure needs in rural Alaska.


    Since its inception, the Denali Commission Act of 1998 has been updated several
    times expanding its mission to include the planning and construction of health
    care facilities and the establishment of the Denali Access System Program for
    surface transportation infrastructure and waterfront transportation projects.


    Most recently, the Denali Commission Act was again expanded to include the authority
    for the Commission to accept funding from other federal agencies as well as gifts
    or donations for the purpose of carrying out the act.'
