- 'Denali Commission Act of 1998, Public Law 150-277, 42 US Cods 3121, The Denali
  Commission Act of 1998 established the Denali Commission (Commission) to deliver
  services of the federal government in the most cost-effective manner by reducing
  administrative and overhead costs. As part of the act, the Commissionâ€™s mission
  of providing job training and other economic development services in rural communities
  was established with a specific focus on promoting rural development, and providing
  power generation, transition facilities, modern communication systems, water and
  sewer systems and other infrastructure needs in rural Alaska.


  Since its inception, the Denali Commission Act of 1998 has been updated several
  times expanding its mission to include the planning and construction of health care
  facilities and the establishment of the Denali Access System Program for surface
  transportation infrastructure and waterfront transportation projects.


  Most recently, the Denali Commission Act was again expanded to include the authority
  for the Commission to accept funding from other federal agencies as well as gifts
  or donations for the purpose of carrying out the act.'
