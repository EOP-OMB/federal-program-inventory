objective: 'EPA is providing grants to support state governments that are interested
  in adopting and implementing California’s motor vehicle greenhouse gas and zero
  emission standards in accordance with Clean Air Act Section 177. The grants are
  provided under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Section 60105(g) [Public Law 117–169,
  title VI, Aug. 16, 2022, 136 Stat. 2076]. Under section 177 of the Clean Air Act,
  states may adopt California’s motor vehicle standards. Section 177 specifies the
  criteria states must meet when they adopt California’s motor vehicle emission standards,
  including that the adopted standards to be identical to California’s standards,
  provide 2 years of lead time, and a waiver must be issued by EPA before a state
  can enforce such standards.  Funding Priorities – Fiscal Year 2024:  The IRA Section
  60105(g) grant program aims to assist states in the adoption and/or implementation
  of California’s greenhouse gas and zero emission motor vehicle standards.'
