objective: 'The Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative (OREI) seeks
  to solve critical organic agricultural issues, priorities, or problems through the
  integration of research, education, and extension activities. The purpose of this
  program is to fund high priority integrated projects that will enhance the ability
  of producers and processors who have already adopted organic standards to grow and
  market high quality organic agricultural products, mitigate and adapt to climate
  change, build resilience of the organic farming system, and protect water and other
  resources. Priority concerns include biological, physical, and social sciences,
  including economics. Consistent with 7 U.S.C. 5925b, OREI has eight goals: 1.) Facilitating
  the development and improvement of organic agriculture production, breeding, and
  processing methods; 2.) Evaluating the potential economic benefits of organic agricultural
  production and methods to producers, processors, and rural communities; 3.) Exploring
  international trade opportunities for organically grown and processed agricultural
  commodities; 4.) Determining desirable traits for organic commodities; 5.) Identifying
  marketing and policy constraints on the expansion of organic agriculture; 6.) Conducting
  advanced on-farm research and development that emphasizes observation of, experimentation
  with, and innovation for working organic farms, including research relating to production,
  marketing, food safety, socioeconomic conditions, and farm business management;
  7.) Examining optimal conservation, soil health, and environmental outcomes relating
  to organically produced agricultural products; and 8.) Developing new and improved
  seed varieties that are particularly suited for organic agriculture.'
