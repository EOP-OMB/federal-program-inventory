objective: "Facilitate the development of organic agriculture production, breeding,\
  \ and processing methods.  \r\nFunctionally identify soil microbial communities\
  \ and ways to manage microbial dynamics to enhance nutrient cycling and disease\
  \ suppression; \r\nDevelop systemic approaches to weed, insect and disease management;\
  \ \r\nPrevent, control, and treat internal and external parasites in various livestock\
  \ species; and Breed crops for disease and insect resistance, good yield in a biologically\
  \ diverse system, compatibility with intercrops, good response to organic fertility\
  \ sources, horizontal resistance (traits determined by multiple genes).  \r\nEvaluate\
  \ the potential economic benefits to producers and processors who use organic methods.\
  \  \r\nAnalyze potential economic costs, returns and risks of organic production\
  \ systems;  \r\nUse environmental valuation tools to quantify externalities of producing\
  \ food, and compare externalities of producing organic and conventional food; -\
  \ \r\nAnalyze price and market structures, including ability of small, medium-,\
  \ and large-scale growers to access different markets, in order to frame policies\
  \ that minimize concentration within the industry; and \r\nAnalyze marketing channels\
  \ to document how organic food is distributed, what share of the organic food dollar\
  \ is returned to the farmer, and the implications of large-scale manufacturers entering\
  \ the organic market. \r\nExplore international trade opportunities for organically\
  \ grown and processed agricultural commodities.  \r\nCompare compatibility of certification\
  \ standards used in different parts of the world, with the ultimate goal of harmonization\
  \ and reciprocity; \r\nUndertake marketing studies of international consumer demand\
  \ for U.S. produced organic goods; and \r\nPerform Welfare analyses (quantified\
  \ gains and losses for producers and consumers) of trade policies affecting international\
  \ competitiveness, including implementation of the National Organic Program, domestic\
  \ support programs such as the Conservation Security Act, country of origin labeling,\
  \ GMO labeling, etc.  \r\nDetermine desirable traits for organic commodities.  \r\
  \nExamine relationships between nutrients in the soil and nutrients in the food\
  \ grown on that soil, including long-term soil nutrient and crop nutrient profiles\
  \ under conventional and organic management; \r\nPerform comparisons of nutrient\
  \ levels between organic and conventional crops and relationship, if any, between\
  \ taste and nutrient profile; Investigate the role of post-harvest handling and\
  \ treatment in the maintenance of quality in fresh market organic products; and\
  \ Determine the reasons for consumer preferences for organic goods. Identify marketing\
  \ and policy constraints on the expansion of organic agriculture. \r\nAnalyze opportunities\
  \ and constraints to organic agriculture resulting from provisions of the Farm Security\
  \ and Rural Investment Act of 2002; \r\nInvestigate specific barriers to markets,\
  \ such as scale-based regulations that restrict family farm access to processors\
  \ and/or markets;  \r\nStudy negative lender perception of organic farming and ways\
  \ to change this; and \r\nAnalyze regulatory barriers, such as lack of access to\
  \ Federal farm programs, and developing solutions to these challenges.  \r\nConduct\
  \ advanced on-farm research and development that emphasizes observation of, experimentation\
  \ with, and innovation for working organic farms, including research relating to\
  \ production and marketing and to socioeconomic conditions. \r\n\r\n(Note: Many\
  \ topics from other goal areas can be conducted on working farms.)  \r\n\r\nDevelop\
  \ rigorous on-farm systems research designs; and Conduct long-term, interdisciplinary\
  \ systems research."
