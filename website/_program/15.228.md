objective: 'Wildland Fire Fuels Management and Community Assistance Program activities
  represent strategic investments in managing vegetation through active management
  to reduce the intensity, severity or negative effects of wildfire. Provides cost-effective
  benefits to the American people, helps restore and maintain healthy ecosystems,
  and supports communities in their efforts to become fire-adapted.  Program activities
  include:  programs that develop local capability including assessment and planning,
  community and homeowner mitigation and education activities, and community and homeowner
  education and implementation; planning and implementing fuels management activities,
  including the training, monitoring or maintenance associated with such fuels management
  activities, on federal land, or on adjacent nonfederal land for activities that
  benefit resources on federal land; and assisting with the prevention of wildfires
  to reduce the risk and impact to communities and their values.

  This program continues to advance the Department of the Interior’s priorities to
  create a conservation stewardship legacy while generating revenue and utilizing
  our natural resources.  In addition, supports BLM’s continued commitment to develop
  and sustain partnerships and reduce and streamline its processes and procedures
  to serve its customers and the public better and faster across all its program areas.
  These reforms allow the Bureau to realign time and resources to completing important
  on–the-ground work. This program also supports the Infrastructure Investment and
  Jobs Act (IIJA) Public Law 117-58, Sec. 40803 Wildfire Risk Reduction.  This program
  supports projects funded through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Sections 50221
  Resilience, 50222 Ecosystems Restoration and 50303 DOI.  Executive Order for EJ/Justic
  40 (EO 12898) and Climate Change (EO 14008).'

    \ breaks and fuel break systems, and funded three to reduce damages and losses\
    \ to valued resources.  \nThe JFSP funds and provides oversight to a national\
    \ collaborative of 15 regional wildland fire science exchanges: the Fire Science\
    \ Exchange Network (FSEN). The FSEN provides the most relevant, current wildland\
    \ fire science information to federal, state, local, tribal, and private stakeholders\
    \ within ecologically similar regions. In Fiscal Year 2020 JFSP funded three FSEN\
    \ projects via cooperative agreement."
