objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. However, the Tax Code provides credits
  for investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment within the United States.
  The credit is 25 percent for qualified property placed into service after December
  31, 2022. Construction on a qualified facility must begin by December 31, 2025.
  Owners of facilities that qualify for the advanced manufacturing investment credit
  may elect to treat investment credits as a payment of tax equal to the amount of
  the credit.
