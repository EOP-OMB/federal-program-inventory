objective: "The purpose of the CHGME Payment Program is to compensate for the disparity\
  \ in the level of Federal Graduate Medical Education (GME) funding for freestanding\
  \ children\u2019s teaching hospitals versus other types of teaching hospitals. Hospitals\
  \ typically receive support for graduate medical education (GME) through Medicare,\
  \ and those payments are provided to hospitals based on their Medicare patient volume.\
  \ Freestanding children\u2019s hospitals receive little to no Graduate Medical Education\
  \ (GME) funding from Medicare because children\u2019s hospitals have a low Medicare\
  \ caseload. The CHGME Payment Program supports freestanding children\u2019s teaching\
  \ hospitals that: 1) Educate and train future pediatricians, pediatric sub-specialists,\
  \ and other non-pediatric residents, including residents in dentistry; 2) Provide\
  \ care for vulnerable and underserved children; and 3) Conduct innovative and valuable\
  \ pediatric research.\nThe CHGME Support Reauthorization Act of 2013 contained a\
  \ provision to establish a quality bonus system (QBS). The goal of the QBS is to\
  \ recognize and incentivize those CHGME Payment Program awardees with high quality\
  \ training to meet the pediatric workforce needs of the nation."
