objective: 'The purpose of the CHGME Payment Program is to compensate for the disparity
  in the level of Federal Graduate Medical Education (GME) funding for freestanding
  children’s teaching hospitals versus other types of teaching hospitals. Hospitals
  typically receive support for graduate medical education (GME) through Medicare,
  and those payments are provided to hospitals based on their Medicare patient volume.
  Freestanding children’s hospitals receive little to no Graduate Medical Education
  (GME) funding from Medicare because children’s hospitals have a low Medicare caseload.
  The CHGME Payment Program supports freestanding children’s teaching hospitals that:
  1) Educate and train future pediatricians, pediatric sub-specialists, and other
  non-pediatric residents, including residents in dentistry; 2) Provide care for vulnerable
  and underserved children; and 3) Conduct innovative and valuable pediatric research.

  The CHGME Support Reauthorization Act of 2013 contained a provision to establish
  a quality bonus system (QBS). The goal of the QBS is to recognize and incentivize
  those CHGME Payment Program awardees with high quality training to meet the pediatric
  workforce needs of the nation.'
