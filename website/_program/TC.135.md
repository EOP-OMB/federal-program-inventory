objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities
  or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, for taxable years ending after 2013,
  the Tax Code provides a premium assistance credit to any eligible taxpayer for any
  qualified health insurance purchased through a Health Insurance Exchange. In general,
  an eligible taxpayer is a taxpayer with annual household income between 100 percent
  and 400 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of the taxpayerâ€™s size
  and that does not have access to affordable minimum essential health care coverage.
  The amount of the credit equals the lesser of (1) the actual premiums paid by the
  taxpayer for such coverage or (2) the difference between the cost of a statutorily-identified
  benchmark plan offered on the exchange and a required payment by the taxpayer that
  increases with income. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117-2) and the
  Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-169) temporarily increased the Premium
  Tax Credit in three ways. For 2021 through 2025, the legislation increased the Premium
  Tax Credit for currently eligible individuals and families, providing access to
  free benchmark plans for those earning 100 to 150 percent of the federal poverty
  level and expanded eligibility to newly include individuals and families with income
  above 400 percent of the federal poverty level.
