objective: "To provide essential sanitation facilities, such as safe drinking water\
  \ and adequate waste disposal systems, for Indian homes and communities.  The IHS\
  \ Sanitation Facilities Construction Program, an integral component of the IHS disease\
  \ prevention activity, has carried out those authorities since 1960 using funds\
  \ appropriated for Sanitation Facilities Construction to provide potable water and\
  \ waste disposal facilities for AI/AN people.  As a result, the rates for infant\
  \ mortality, the mortality rate for gastroenteritis and other environmentally related\
  \ diseases have been dramatically reduced, by about 80 percent since 1973.  The\
  \ IHS physicians and health professionals credit many of these health status improvements\
  \ to IHS' provision of water supplies, sewage disposal facilities, development of\
  \ solid waste sites, and provision of technical assistance to Indian water and sewer\
  \ utility organizations. The provision of Indian sanitation facilities is a very\
  \ important component of the overall effort required to achieve a reduction in waterborne\
  \ disease outbreaks, a goal highlighted in Healthy People 2020 \"Topics & Objectives‚Äù\
  \ for Environmental Health.  Safe drinking water supplies and adequate waste disposal\
  \ facilities are essential preconditions for most health promotion and disease prevention\
  \ efforts, as well as being a major factor in the quality of life of Indian people.\r\
