objective: Through CSP, NRCS provides financial and technical assistance to eligible
  producers to conserve and enhance soil, water, air, and related natural resources
  on their land. Eligible lands include cropland, grassland, prairie land, pastureland,
  rangeland, nonindustrial private forest lands, agricultural land under the jurisdiction
  of an Indian tribe, and other private agricultural land (including cropped woodland,
  marshes, and agricultural land used for the production of livestock) on which resource
  concerns related to agricultural production could be addressed. Participation in
  the program is voluntary. CSP encourages land stewards to improve their conservation
  performance by installing and adopting additional activities, and improving, maintaining,
  and managing existing activities on agricultural land and nonindustrial private
  forest land. The NRCS will make CSP available nationwide on a continuous application
  basis.
