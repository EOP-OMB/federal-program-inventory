objective: The Rural Hospital Flexibility Program (Flex) enables state designated
  entities to support critical access hospitals in quality improvement, quality reporting,
  performance improvement, and benchmarking; to assist facilities seeking designation
  as critical access hospitals; and to create a program to establish or expand the
  provision of rural emergency medical services. Flex Program objectives include quality,
  operational, financial, and population health improvement with the goal of supporting
  access to necessary health care services in rural communities. State Flex programs
  will act as resources and focal points for these activities within their respective
  states. The Rural Veterans Health Access Program provides funding to states to coordinate
  activities to provide rural veterans access to services for needed mental health
  care via the use of networks, electronic communication and telehealth networks.
  The program targets states with high percentages of veterans to the total population.

- description: 'Accomplishments for the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program:
    In 2020, 1282 Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) participated in the Medicare Beneficiary
    Quality Improvement Program (MBQIP), to report on quality measures aligned with
    those collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Quality measures
    quantify health care processes, outcomes, patient perceptions, and organizational
    structure and systems to guide decisions about improvements to health care services.
    MBQIP provides the opportunity for rural hospitals to evaluate their quality data
    and compare outcomes with that of hospitals with similar characteristics (such
    as small bed size, limited resources, and health services). 61.1% of CAHs reported
    improvement in core MBQIP measures and 35.2% of CAHs reported improvement in additional
    MBQIP measures.


    Grantee accomplishments for the Rural Veterans Health Access Program include:
    initiating Veteran’s Administration telehealth visits at community-based healthcare
    provider sites establishing a coalition to increases access to care for veterans
    in rural areas; and  the creation of a new Project ECHO line specific for veteran-related
    health issues, that launched in 2020.'
