objective: The Rural Hospital Flexibility Program (Flex) enables state designated
  entities to support critical access hospitals in quality improvement, quality reporting,
  performance improvement, and benchmarking; to assist facilities seeking designation
  as critical access hospitals; and to create a program to establish or expand the
  provision of rural emergency medical services. Flex Program objectives include quality,
  operational, financial, and population health improvement with the goal of supporting
  access to necessary health care services in rural communities. State Flex programs
  will act as resources and focal points for these activities within their respective
  states. The Rural Veterans Health Access Program provides funding to states to coordinate
  activities to provide rural veterans access to services for needed mental health
  care via the use of networks, electronic communication and telehealth networks.
  The program targets states with high percentages of veterans to the total population.
