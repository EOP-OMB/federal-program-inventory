objective: "The Environmental Justice Small Grants (EJSG) Program provides funding\
  \ directly to community-based organizations for projects that help residents of\
  \ underserved communities understand and address local environmental and public\
  \ health issues. The term \u201Cunderserved community\u201D refers to a community\
  \ with environmental justice concerns and/or vulnerable populations, including people\
  \ of color, low income, rural, tribal, indigenous, and homeless populations that\
  \ may be disproportionately impacted by environmental harms and risks. In general,\
  \ the EJSG program awards grants that support community-driven projects designed\
  \ to engage, educate, and empower communities to better understand and address local\
  \ environmental and public health issues. Community-driven projects are projects\
  \ that include activities where community residents and/or representatives are integrally\
  \ involved in the thinking behind and execution of those activities. Therefore,\
  \ applying organizations should have a direct connection to the underserved community\
  \ impacted by environmental harms and risks."
