objective: The Environmental Justice Small Grants (EJSG) Program provides funding
  directly to community-based organizations for projects that help residents of underserved
  communities understand and address local environmental and public health issues.
  The term “underserved community” refers to a community with environmental justice
  concerns and/or vulnerable populations, including people of color, low income, rural,
  tribal, indigenous, and homeless populations that may be disproportionately impacted
  by environmental harms and risks. In general, the EJSG program awards grants that
  support community-driven projects designed to engage, educate, and empower communities
  to better understand and address local environmental and public health issues. Community-driven
  projects are projects that include activities where community residents and/or representatives
  are integrally involved in the thinking behind and execution of those activities.
  Therefore, applying organizations should have a direct connection to the underserved
  community impacted by environmental harms and risks.

- description: 'In 2021, 99 organizations nationwide were selected to receive awards
    of approximately $75,000 each for one-year projects. These grants will benefit
    communities in 37 different states, as well as Washington DC and Puerto Rico.
    In 2021, for the first time ever, EPA created a designation for small nonprofit
    organizations and set-aside funding exclusively for those qualifying organizations.
    Per the 2021 Request for Applications (RFA), a small nonprofit is defined as a
    non-profit organization with 10 or fewer full-time employees on staff. This set-aside
    is intended to promote environmental justice funding to those communities and
    grassroots organizations that need it the most. 83 of the 99 projects (84%) are
    going to qualifying small nonprofits. The remaining 16 projects are going to larger
    nonprofit organizations and tribal governments. Additional program accomplishments
    for 2021 can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/environmental-justice-small-grants-program.'
