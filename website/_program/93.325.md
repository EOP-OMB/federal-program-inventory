objective: "The Paralysis Resource Center (PRC) grant is awarded to the Christopher\
  \ & Dana Reeve Foundation. The mission of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation\
  \ in carrying out the PRC activities aligns well with ACLâ€™s mission and provides\
  \ important new programmatic opportunities for persons with disabilities and older\
  \ adults. The PRC provides comprehensive information for people living with spinal\
  \ cord injury, paralysis and mobility-related disabilities and their families. Resources\
  \ include information and referral by phone and email in multiple languages including\
  \ English and Spanish; a peer and family support mentoring program; a military and\
  \ veterans program; multicultural outreach services; free lending library; quality\
  \ of life grants; and a national website. \r\nThe mission of the National Limb Loss\
  \ Resource Center, operated by the Amputee Coalition is to reach out to and empower\
  \ people affected by limb loss to achieve their full potential through education,\
  \ support, advocacy, and the promotion of limb loss prevention. The National Limb\
  \ Loss Resource Center programs will use both traditional and innovative approaches\
  \ to educate and inform people with limb loss, their family members, health care\
  \ providers, policy makers, community members, and the general public about limb\
  \ loss and limb difference. The Limb Loss Program will continue existing activities\
  \ and programs that promote health, wellness and the adoption of healthy behaviors\
  \ with the objective of preventing and/or reducing chronic conditions associated\
  \ with limb loss. "
