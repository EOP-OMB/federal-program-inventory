objective: "The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities aim to achieve the following\
  \ outcomes through a variety of pilot projects:\n\u2022\tIncreased markets (supply\
  \ and demand) for climate-smart commodities;\n\u2022\tIncreased adoption of Climate-Smart\
  \ Agriculture and Forestry (CSAF) practices and systems that reduce agricultural\
  \ greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and/or increase carbon sequestration from the agricultural\
  \ sector;\n\u2022\tDemonstration of scalable and low-cost measurement/quantification,\
  \ monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) systems;\n\u2022\tIncreased innovation\
  \ and consistency in measuring/quantifying farm-level greenhouse gas benefits;\n\
  \u2022\tTesting and evaluation of efficient traceability through supply chains from\
  \ production of commodity to delivery to the consumer;\n\u2022\tImproved understanding\
  \ and communication of economic and adaptation benefits, as well as ancillary environmental\
  \ benefits;\n\u2022\tEquitable administration that includes small and underserved\
  \ producers as well as early adopters (i.e., producers who have already used some\
  \ climate-smart approaches);\n\u2022\tUnderstanding of marketability advantages\
  \ for a variety of farm types;\n\u2022\tEmpowerment of farmers, ranchers, and forest\
  \ landowners to drive Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry markets and practice\
  \ adoption; and\n\u2022\tDevelopment of additional public-private partnerships to\
  \ foster and develop Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry markets."
