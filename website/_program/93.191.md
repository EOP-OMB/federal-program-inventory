results:
- description: In Academic Year 2021-2022 the GPE program reported 373 participants
    and 183 graduates nationwide. Over 142 GPE trainees served in Medically Underserved
    Communities (MUCs), and seven percent intend to, or already provide wrap-around
    services. The GPE program developed or enhanced 730 courses, through which 8,445
    participants were trained. This reach included trainees not enrolled in the GPE
    program, but who benefited from the trainings as well. Further, the continuing
    education for Academic Year 2021-2022, was comprised of distance learning, classroom-based
    and hybrid modes of deliver. These participants were predominately employed in
    primary care settings (277) and medically underserved communities (266). Post
    one-year graduate follow-up indicates that 37 percent of GPE graduates are currently
    employed or practicing in Medically Underserved Communities; 22 percent are located
    in primary care settings.
