objective: The Graduate Psychology Education Program supports training of doctoral
  health psychology students, interns, and post-doctoral residents to provide integrated,
  interdisciplinary, behavioral health and Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and other Substance
  Use Disorder (SUD) prevention and treatment services in high need and high demand
  areas. The program also supports faculty development of health service psychologists.
  The overarching goal of the program is to prepare and build capacity of the doctoral
  health psychology workforce, to provide mental/behavioral health care, including
  OUD and other SUD prevention and treatment services, in high need and high demand
  areas. Grants will be awarded to assist eligible entities in meeting the costs to
  develop, operate, and maintain graduate psychology doctoral programs, internships,
  and post-doctoral residency programs in health psychology.

results:
- description: 'The GPE Program provided stipend support to 263 students participating
    in practica, internships, or post-doctoral residency programs in psychology. The
    majority of students who received a stipend were trained in medically underserved
    communities (94 percent) and/or a primary care setting (87 percent). Of the 254
    students who completed GPE-supported programs, 75 percent intended to become employed
    or pursue further training in medically underserved communities and 58 percent
    intended to become employed or pursue further training in primary care settings.


    GPE grantees partnered with 186 sites to provide 627 clinical training experiences
    for psychology graduate students (e.g., hospitals, ambulatory practice sites,
    and academic institutions) as well as 3,140 interprofessional team-based care
    trainees who participated in clinical training along with the psychology graduate
    students. Approximately 88 percent of these training sites were located in medically
    underserved communities and 82 percent were primary care and/or rural settings.
    Approximately 48 percent of the sites offered substance use treatment services
    and 36 percent offered telehealth services.'
  year: '2018'
- description: In Academic Year 2018-2019, the GPE Program provided stipend support
    to 267 students participating in practica, internships, or post-doctoral residency
    programs in health psychology. The majority of students who received a stipend
    were trained in medically underserved communities (96 percent) and/or a primary
    care setting (87 percent). The GPE students provided 136,678 patients care hours
    in a primary care setting, 199,989 in a medically underserved community and 30,372
    in a rural area. In Academic Year 2019-2020, the GPE Program trained and provided
    stipends to 251 students participating in practica, internships, or post-doctoral
    residency programs in health psychology that focused on integrated, interdisciplinary,
    behavioral health and Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and other Substance Use Disorder
    (SUD) prevention and treatment services in high need and high demand areas. Of
    the 251 GPE students trained, 33% were trained in medically underserved communities,
    32% were trained in a primary care setting, and 15% were trained in a rural setting.  Lastly,
    3,920 faculty received training in the provision of OUD and other SUD.

- description: "In Academic Year 2020-2021, the GPE Program trained and provided stipends\
    \ to 376 students participating in practica, internships, or post-doctoral residency\
    \ programs in health psychology. The majority of students who received a stipend\
    \ were trained in medically underserved communities (92 percent) and/or primary\
    \ care setting (74 percent). Thirty-four percent of trainees were trained in a\
    \ rural setting. Ninety-six percent of students received training in substance\
    \ use treatment, 92 percent received training in opioid use treatment, and 67\
    \ percent received training in medication assisted treatment for substance use\
    \ disorder and opioid use disorder. Additionally, 97 percent of students trained\
    \ at sites offering telehealth services, and 54 percent received training in health\
    \ equity/the social determinants of health. Of the 181 students who completed\
    \ GPE-supported programs during this time period, 70 percent intended to become\
    \ employed or pursue further training in medically underserved communities, and\
    \ 46 percent intended to become employed or pursue further training in primary\
    \ care settings. \n\nLastly, HRSA surveyed a sample of trainees to evaluate GPE.\
    \ This evaluation found that almost all trainees (91 percent) sought to work in\
    \ a rural or underserved community because of the opportunity to apply a diverse\
    \ skill set and 86 percent said training in an underserved area influenced their\
    \ decision to work in a rural or underserved community upon completion."
  year: '2021'
- description: In Academic Year 2021-2022 the GPE program reported 373 participants
    and 183 graduates nationwide. Over 142 GPE trainees served in Medically Underserved
    Communities (MUCs), and seven percent intend to, or already provide wrap-around
    services. The GPE program developed or enhanced 730 courses, through which 8,445
    participants were trained. This reach included trainees not enrolled in the GPE
    program, but who benefited from the trainings as well. Further, the continuing
    education for Academic Year 2021-2022, was comprised of distance learning, classroom-based
    and hybrid modes of deliver. These participants were predominately employed in
    primary care settings (277) and medically underserved communities (266). Post
    one-year graduate follow-up indicates that 37 percent of GPE graduates are currently
    employed or practicing in Medically Underserved Communities; 22 percent are located
    in primary care settings.
