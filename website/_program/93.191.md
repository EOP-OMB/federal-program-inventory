- description: 'The GPE Program provided stipend support to 263 students participating
    in practica, internships, or post-doctoral residency programs in psychology. The
    majority of students who received a stipend were trained in medically underserved
    communities (94 percent) and/or a primary care setting (87 percent). Of the 254
    students who completed GPE-supported programs, 75 percent intended to become employed
    or pursue further training in medically underserved communities and 58 percent
    intended to become employed or pursue further training in primary care settings.


    GPE grantees partnered with 186 sites to provide 627 clinical training experiences
    for psychology graduate students (e.g., hospitals, ambulatory practice sites,
    and academic institutions) as well as 3,140 interprofessional team-based care
    trainees who participated in clinical training along with the psychology graduate
    students. Approximately 88 percent of these training sites were located in medically
    underserved communities and 82 percent were primary care and/or rural settings.
    Approximately 48 percent of the sites offered substance use treatment services
    and 36 percent offered telehealth services.'

    \ This evaluation found that almost all trainees (91 percent) sought to work in\
    \ a rural or underserved community because of the opportunity to apply a diverse\
    \ skill set and 86 percent said training in an underserved area influenced their\
    \ decision to work in a rural or underserved community upon completion."
