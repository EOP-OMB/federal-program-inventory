objective: "The Urbanized Area Formula Funding Program (49 U.S.C. 5307) makes federal\
  \ resources available to local and regional government authorities and states for\
  \ transit capital and operating assistance and for transportation-related planning\
  \ in urbanized areas. An urbanized area is an 'Urban Area', as defined and designated\
  \ in the most recent decennial census by the Department of Commerce - Bureau of\
  \ the Census, that encompasses a population of not less than 50,000.  In addition,\
  \ a Passenger Ferry Grant Program sub-component 5307(h) remains in this program.\
  \ \n It should be noted that 20.532 Passenger Ferry Grant Program, Electric or Low-Emitting\
  \ Ferry Pilot Program, and Ferry Service for Rural Communities Program is the Assistance\
  \ Listing for all other federal funding for Ferry projects."
