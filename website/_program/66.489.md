objective: 'To assist in responding to and alleviating emergency situations affecting
  public water systems. Pursuant to Section 1442(b) of the Safe Drinking Water Act
  (SDWA), this assistance program provides grant funding for projects and activities
  in emergency situations affecting public water systems that are necessary for preventing,
  limiting, or mitigating a substantial danger to public health and that would not
  be taken without this emergency assistance. Eligible applicants include States or
  publicly owned water systems where the Administrator has made an Emergency Determination
  under SDWA section 1442(b). Funding is anticipated to be for projects and activities
  that support SDWA compliance, including: (1) operations and maintenance of facilities;
  (2) building technical, managerial, and financial (TMF) capacity; (3) debt relief;
  (4) meeting the requirements of federal enforcement actions, including emergency
  administrative orders; (5) establishing alternative sources of drinking water and/or;
  (6) making capital and managerial improvements, as necessary, to return facilities
  to conditions in which publicly owned water systems can feasibly sustain their operations.  In
  FY 2025 funding priorities will continue to be for projects and activities in emergency
  situations affecting public water systems that are necessary for preventing, limiting,
  or mitigating a substantial danger to public health.'
