    provided supports the athletic programs of the United States Air Force Academy,
    in the form of public education, military training programs; athletic program
    development, organization and support; character and leadership education and
    development; and pre-candidate, cadet and staff motivation for a lifetime of service
    through physical and mentally challenging physical education and fitness programs.
    Within the cooperative agreement there are 6 requirement/objectives: Coaching
    and Sports Involvement; Recruiting; Logistics; Ticketing; Sports Conference Administration
    Involvement; and Civic Outreach.'

- description: The original, existing cooperative agreement, which is the only cooperative
    agreement ever awarded under this statute, was awarded in 2013.  The CA specified
    the original performance period(s) to include a one year basic period and four
    additional one-year optional performance periods (annual funding periods) with
    annual Air Force approval of the CA program considerations. In 2018, the Assistant
    Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR) approved
    extending the current five year CA indefinitely, based on approval of current
    program considerations, a continuing need and the annual incremental funding allocated
    for this program. Each year’s annual funding period (incremental funding) is determined
    by the previous year's funded amount, an agreed to revised budget, and available
    appropriated funding (APF) and funding from revenue activities which are assigned
    in the program objectives. The SecAF delegated all authorities to SAF/MR, which
    includes the approval of the funding vehicle (the CA), the program considerations,
    and the responsibility for overseeing the AFAAC business activities. APF amounts
    associated with the CA are expected to grow, consistent with an inflation average
    of 6%. The program will continue in FY 2019 and beyond.

- description: The USAFA athletic program supports the Academy’s mission to build
    leaders of character for the Air Force and our nation.  The experiences obtained
    by participation in the athletic programs prepare and motivate cadets for a lifetime
    of public service through physical education, fitness training and testing, and
    intramural and intercollegiate athletic competition.
