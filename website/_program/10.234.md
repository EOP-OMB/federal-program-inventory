objective: "The goal of this program is to fund organizations, to be known as Cooperators,\
  \ that will collaborate with USDA on the delivery of targeted technical assistance\
  \ and related activities to achieve future outcomes of improved equitable participation\
  \ of farmers, ranchers and forest land owners, numerous entities and individuals\
  \ in USDA programs and services.  \n\nThe funded Cooperators will provide ongoing\
  \ coordination and substantial involvement with USDA to ensure that the plans for\
  \ program development, curriculum development, deployment, and evaluation of impact\
  \ are closely coordinated with USDA.  Cooperators are required to coordinate with\
  \ all other recipients of technical assistance resources in a manner as determined\
  \ by USDA.  Individuals and groups that are the ultimate recipients of the technical\
  \ assistance must be economically distressed/underserved communities, including\
  \ socially disadvantaged producers, limited resource farmers and ranchers, veterans,\
  \ and other key targeted communities."
