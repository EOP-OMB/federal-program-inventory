    investments in the Territory of Guam have resulted in a more unified support of
    the Indo-Pacific build-up and undertook investments to enhance the cargo through-put
    of the port facilities to sustain the enlarged mission footprint across the Territory
    of Guam; expand landfill capacity to support build-up related construction waste,
    and better interpret and communicate to its population. This also gave rise to
    the broader Economic Adjustment Committee-staffed effort resulting in a $186M
    program of outside-the-fence investments in infrastructure that was directly responsible
    for the Governor signing the Programmatic Agreement for live fire activity, allowing
    the overall basing effort to progress.   Investments in the Northern Mariana Islands
    resolved a five-year impasse on the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
    Joint Military Training Environmental Impact Statement and the signing of a lease
    with the Commonwealth Port Authority enabling the Air Force Divert and Exercises
    Initiative to proceed with military construction.

- description: "Example Project 1: Grant awards funded growth management planning\
    \ by communities for investments to public services (schools, public health, workforce\
    \ training, child care, etc.) and infrastructure (utilities, housing, transportation\
    \ linkages, etc.) necessary to support the Air Forceâ€™s strategic basing of two\
    \ F-35A squadrons and the accompanying 2,765 military personnel and dependents.\
    \  \n\nExample Project 2: Planning investments at one installation identified\
    \ the need for 532 new housing units to support the planned mission growth.  By\
    \ mid-2021, the community had satisfied 316 new units and was continuing to address\
    \ the balance.  Investments that support the consolidation of cyber capabilities\
    \ have commenced but are expected to support the growth of over 4,300 personnel\
    \ by Fiscal Year 2023. This effort invests in cyber defense, resilience, and the\
    \ continued integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum of military\
    \ operations."
