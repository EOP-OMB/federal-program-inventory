- description: "USDA awarded approximately $1.14 million for three Urban and Innovative\
    \ Agriculture Planning Projects and approximately $1.88 million for seven Urban\
    \ and Innovative Agriculture Implementation Projects. Planning projects initiate\
    \ or expand efforts of farmers, gardeners, citizens, government officials, schools\
    \ and other stakeholders in urban and suburban areas. I mplementation projects\
    \ accelerate existing and emerging models of urban, indoor and other agricultural\
    \ practices that serve multiple farmers. Projects will improve local food access\
    \ and collaborate with partner organizations and may support infrastructure needs,\
    \ emerging technologies, educational endeavors and urban farming policy implementation.\n\
    Activities funded include operating community gardens and nonprofit farms, increasing\
    \ food production and access in economically distressed communities, providing\
    \ job training and education, and developing business plans and zoning. \nThrough\
    \ Community Compost and Food Waste Reduction (CCFWR) Projects, USDA invested approximately\
    \ $1.09 million in 13 pilot projects that develop and test strategies for planning\
    \ and implementing municipal compost plans and food waste reduction. Priority\
    \ was given to projects that anticipated or demonstrated economic benefits, incorporated\
    \ plans to make compost easily accessible to farmers, including community gardeners,\
    \ integrated other food waste strategies, including food recovery efforts, and\
    \ collaborated with multiple partners."
