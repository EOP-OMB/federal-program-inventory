objective: "The Department of the Treasury Asset Forfeiture Program is a nationwide\
  \ law enforcement initiative that removes the tools of crime from criminal organizations,\
  \ deters crime and deprives wrongdoers of the proceeds of their criminal proceeds,\
  \ and recovers property that may be used to compensate victims. \r\n\r\nEquitable\
  \ sharing further enhances the law enforcement mission by fostering cooperation\
  \ among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.  Federal law authorizes\
  \ Treasury to share federally forfeited property with participating state and local\
  \ law enforcement agencies.  Equitable sharing is discretionary and limited by statute.\
  \   \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of the Justice  administers a similar program."
