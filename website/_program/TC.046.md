objective: The baseline tax system would not allow deductions in addition to normal
  depreciation allowances for particular investments in particular industries. Instead,
  it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities.
  In contrast, under current law farmers can deduct up to 25 percent of their gross
  income for expenses incurred as a result of site and habitat improvement activities
  that will benefit endangered species on their farm land, in accordance with site
  specific management actions included in species recovery plans approved pursuant
  to the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
