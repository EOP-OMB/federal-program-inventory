objective: The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments
  and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In
  contrast, the Tax Code allows a credit for qualified carbon oxide captured at a
  qualified facility and disposed of in secure geological storage. In addition, the
  provision allows a credit for qualified carbon oxide that is captured at a qualified
  facility and used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural
  gas recovery project. The credit differs according to whether the carbon was captured
  using equipment which was originally placed in service before February 9, 2018,
  or thereafter.
