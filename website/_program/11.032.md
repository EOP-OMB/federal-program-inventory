objective: "The purpose of the State Digital Equity Planning and Capacity Grant Programs\
  \ is to promote the achievement of digital equity, support digital inclusion activities,\
  \ and build capacity for efforts by States relating to the adoption of broadband\
  \ by residents of those States. States interested in participating in the State\
  \ Digital Equity Capacity Grant Program must first complete State Digital Equity\
  \ Plans as contemplated in Section 60304(c) of the Infrastructure Investment and\
  \ Jobs Act of 2021, Public Law 117-58, 135 Stat. 429 (November 15, 2021) (Infrastructure\
  \ Act or Act), also commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. \n\nThe\
  \ State Planning Grant Program funds may be used to 1) develop the State Digital\
  \ Equity Plan of the State, and 2) to make subgrants to community, local, and tribal\
  \ entities to assist in the development of the State Digital Equity Plan of the\
  \ State.\n\nDigital Equity is fundamentally concerned with promoting full participation\
  \ in the digital economy and society by all.  Achievement of Digital Equity requires\
  \ strategic investments in human and community capacity.  Each State Digital Equity\
  \ Plan prepared using State Digital Equity Planning Grant funding should include\
  \ a clear description of the State\u2019s vision for digital equity in the context\
  \ of its overarching strategy and goals.\n\nThe statutory requirements for the contents\
  \ of State Digital Equity Plans are as follows:\n1. Identification of barriers to\
  \ digital equity faced by Covered Populations in the State;\n2. Measurable objectives\
  \ for documenting and promoting, among each Covered Population located in that State;\n\
  3. An assessment of how the measurable objectives will impact and interact with\
  \ outcomes within a State;\n4. A description of how the State plans to collaborate\
  \ with key stakeholders in the State, which may include local institutions, governments,\
  \ organizations, and agencies; and\n5. A list of organizations with which the Administering\
  \ Entity for the State collaborated in developing the Plan."
