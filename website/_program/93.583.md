objective: "The objective of the Wilson Fish demonstration program is to develop innovative\
  \ alternatives projects to support refugee resettlement. The current alternative\
  \ project, the Wilson-Fish Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Coordination\
  \ Program, targets refugee families with children under the age of 18 and who are\
  \ TANF-eligible. This program provides funds for the development and implementation\
  \ of innovative approaches throughout a state to facilitate access to relevant,\
  \ customized, and culturally and linguistically appropriate integrated services\
  \ and resources. Funds are also used to develop and provide in-person and remote\
  \ services and/or resources that enhance or complement programming serving TANF-eligible\
  \ refugees to address unmet needs. These projects require coordination between recipients\
  \ and the state TANF office. The program is focused on refugees who have been in\
  \ the United States less than thirty-six months, which is the time they can receive\
  \ interim support, medical services, support services, and case management, as needed,\
  \ in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and\
  \ fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers.\
  \ The Wilson-Fish TANF Coordination Program (FY 2020 \u2013 FY 2023) does not include\
  \ cash assistance."
