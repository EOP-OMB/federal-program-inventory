objective: The objective of the Wilson Fish demonstration program is to develop innovative
  alternatives projects to support refugee resettlement. The current alternative project,
  the Wilson-Fish Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Coordination Program,
  targets refugee families with children under the age of 18 and who are TANF-eligible.
  This program provides funds for the development and implementation of innovative
  approaches throughout a state to facilitate access to relevant, customized, and
  culturally and linguistically appropriate integrated services and resources. Funds
  are also used to develop and provide in-person and remote services and/or resources
  that enhance or complement programming serving TANF-eligible refugees to address
  unmet needs. These projects require coordination between recipients and the state
  TANF office. The program is focused on refugees who have been in the United States
  less than thirty-six months, which is the time they can receive interim support,
  medical services, support services, and case management, as needed, in a manner
  that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and fosters greater
  coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers. The Wilson-Fish
  TANF Coordination Program (FY 2020 â€“ FY 2023) does not include cash assistance.
