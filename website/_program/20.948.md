  \ within the multimodal transportation networks to reach their desired destination\
  \ safely, affordably, and with a comparable level of efficiency and ease. \n•\t\
  Reconnect communities and mitigating neighborhood bifurcation through land bridges,\
  \ caps, lids, linear parks, investments in walking, biking and rolling assets, and\
  \ other solutions. \n•\tAddress disproportional impacts of crashes on underserved\
  \ communities, including individuals with disabilities. \n•\tExpand access to critical\
  \ community services such as education and healthcare through public transportation/mass\
  \ transit services. \n•\tIncrease housing supply, particularly location-efficient\
  \ affordable housing, locally driven land use and zoning reform, rural main street\
  \ revitalization, growth management, and transit-oriented development. \n•\tAddress\
  \ the unique challenges rural and Tribal communities face related to mobility and\
  \ economic development, including isolation, transportation cost burden, and traffic\
  \ safety. \n•\tEncourage an increase in housing supply, particularly location-efficient\
  \ affordable housing,  land use and zoning reform, rural main street revitalization,\
  \ growth management, and transit-oriented development. \n•\tIncorporate and support\
  \ integrated land use, economic development and transportation planning to improve\
  \ the movement of people and goods and local fiscal health, facilitates greater\
  \ public and private investments and strategies in land-use productivity, including\
  \ rural main street revitalization or increase in the production or preservation\
