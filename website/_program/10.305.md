objective: The purpose of ISE is to support the internationalization of food, agriculture
  and related programs at U.S. universities and colleges. It is intended that ISE
  will improve the ability of American students, business people, and community members
  to compete more effectively in the global world of agriculture. ISE projects are
  to strengthen the global competence and competitiveness of American colleges, universities
  and businesses in the food, agriculture, and related sectors. In addition, ISE projects
  must be directed to agricultural research, extension, and/or teaching activities
  that enhance the capabilities of American colleges and universities to conduct international
  collaborative research, extension and teaching. Our success in the global arena
  will increasingly require U.S. colleges and universities to produce graduates who
  can operate competently in domestic and international settings. Through their outreach
  efforts, universities and colleges also play a critical role in helping U.S. producers
  successfully operate in foreign markets.
