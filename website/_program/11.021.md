  \ the Small Business Research and\r\nDevelopment Enhancement Act of 1992, extending\
  \ the program to the year 2000 and then to\r\n2008. The program was reauthorized\
  \ under Public Law 112-81, Section E.  For over thirty years--since FY 1985--NOAA\

  \ the SBA-administered Small Business Innovation Research  Program. "
