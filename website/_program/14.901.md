objective: "HUD, through this Healthy Homes and Weatherization Cooperation Demonstration\
  \ (HHWCD) NOFO, is interested in supporting demonstrations in up to 5 communities\
  \ that provide housing interventions in lower-income households that are conducted\
  \ jointly through the coordination of HUDâ€™s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy\
  \ Homes (OLHCHH)-funded\n Healthy Homes Production (HHP) program and programs funded\
  \ by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).\
  \  A critical goal of this demonstration is to determine whether this coordinated\
  \ delivery of services achieves cost-effectiveness and better outcomes in improving\
  \ the safety and quality of homes, including health and energy efficiency.  The\
  \ coordinated assessments and interventions are expected to provide additional benefits\
  \ to households through the combined mitigation of health and safety hazards and\
  \ improvements in energy efficiency and comfort.  These grants are intended to facilitate\

results:
- description: The HHWCD program is identifying efficiencies from coordinating healthy
    homes and weatherization programs, thus reducing housing-related health and safety
    hazards and reducing energy consumption and ambient water damage. The RTM program
    is making public housing units free of elevated radon levels, thus reducing risks
    of lung cancer and other diseases associated with radon exposure.
