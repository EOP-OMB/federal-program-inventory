objective: The Title IV-E Foster Care program helps states, Indian tribes, tribal
  organizations and tribal consortia (tribes) to provide safe and stable out-of-home
  care for children under the jurisdiction of the state or tribal child welfare agency
  until the children are returned home safely, placed with adoptive families, or placed
  in other planned arrangements for permanency.  The program provides funds  to assist
  with the costs of foster care maintenance for eligible children; administrative
  costs to manage the program; and training for public agency staff, foster parents
  and eligible professional partner agency staff.  In addition, $3 million is reserved
  for technical assistance and plan development/implementation awards to eligible
  tribes.
