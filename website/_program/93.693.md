objective: "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is committed to improving\
  \ safety and quality of care in the Nation’s Nursing Homes. Nursing home staffing\
  \ has been known as a critical factor for improving care for nursing home residents\
  \ for many years. However, there have been challenges with nursing homes’ ability\
  \ to obtain enough nursing staff to meet each resident’s needs. The Nursing Home\
  \ Staffing (NHS) Campaign project is aimed at increasing the availability of nurses\
  \ (e.g., registered nurses (RNs) to work in the nursing home environment, such as\
  \ in qualifying nursing homes or in an oversight capacity for a state inspection\
  \ agency. \n\nThrough this project, CMS will award multiple cooperative agreements\
  \ to entities to who will in turn, administer financial incentives, such as tuition\
  \ reimbursement and stipends to RNs who will then work in a qualifying nursing home\
  \ or state survey agency for three years."
