objective: CRP is a voluntary program which contracts directly with agricultural producers
  so environmentally sensitive agricultural land is not farmed or ranched but instead
  devoted to conservation benefits. The objective is to protect the Nation's long-term
  capability to produce food and fiber; to reduce soil erosion and sedimentation,
  improve water quality, and create or enhance habitat for wildlife.
