objective: The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is authorized by the Food Security
  Act of 1985 and was reauthorized by the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018. The
  program is also governed by regulations published in 7 CFR, part 1410. The program
  is implemented by Farm Service Agency on behalf of USDAâ€™s Commodity Credit Corporation.
  CRP is a voluntary program that contracts with agricultural producers so that environmentally
  sensitive agricultural land is not farmed or ranched, but instead devoted to conservation
  benefits. The objective is to protect the Nation's long-term capability to produce
  food and fiber; to reduce soil erosion and sedimentation, improve water quality,
  and create or enhance habitat for wildlife.
