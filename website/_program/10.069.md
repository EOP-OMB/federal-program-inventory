objective: "The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is authorized by the Food Security\
  \ Act of 1985 and was reauthorized by the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018.\
  \ The program is also governed by regulations published in 7 CFR, part 1410. The\
  \ program is implemented by Farm Service Agency on behalf of USDA\u2019s Commodity\
  \ Credit Corporation. CRP is a voluntary program that contracts with agricultural\
  \ producers so that environmentally sensitive agricultural land is not farmed or\
  \ ranched, but instead devoted to conservation benefits. The objective is to protect\
  \ the Nation's long-term capability to produce food and fiber; to reduce soil erosion\
  \ and sedimentation, improve water quality, and create or enhance habitat for wildlife."
