objective: Under the baseline tax system, all income would generally be taxed under
  the regular tax rate schedule. The baseline tax system would not allow preferentially
  low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast,
  the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a taxpayerâ€™s taxable income for any discharge
  of indebtedness of up to $750,000 ($375,000 in the case of a married individual
  filing a separate return) from a qualified principal residence. The provision applies
  to debt discharged after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2026.
