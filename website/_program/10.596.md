objective: 'Pilot projects to reduce dependency and increase work requirements and

  that raise the number of work registrants under section 6(d) of the Food and Nutrition
  Act of 2008, as amended, who obtain unsubsidized employment, increase the earned
  income of the registrants, and reduce the reliance of the registrants on public
  assistance, so as to reduce the need for SNAP benefits.'
