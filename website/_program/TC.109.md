objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Under current law, however, financial institutions that
  own zone academy bonds receive a nonrefundable tax credit rather than interest.
  The credit is included in gross income. Proceeds from zone academy bonds may only
  be used to renovate, but not construct, qualifying schools and for certain other
  school purposes. The total amount of zone academy bonds that may be issued was limited
  to $1.4 billion in 2009 and 2010. As of March 2010, issuers of the unused authorization
  of such bonds could opt to receive direct payment with the yield becoming fully
  taxable. An additional $0.4 billion of these bonds with a tax credit was authorized
  to be issued each year in 2011 through 2017.
