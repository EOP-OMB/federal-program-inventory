objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators. ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is\
  \ premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future\
  \ leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect\
  \ official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today. ECA programs inform,\
  \ engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society \u2013\
  \ including young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals\
  \ \u2013 increasing the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience\
  \ with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule\
  \ of law, economic choice, and individual dignity, while building international\
  \ knowledge and capacity among Americans. The purpose of the Teacher Exchange programs\
  \ is to provide K-12 educators from the United States and around the world with\
  \ the opportunity to enhance their teaching, leadership and technology skills through\
  \ professional development and exchange. Educators participate in seminars, teach,\
  \ observe best practices, pursue individualized research and develop courses with\
  \ the goal of globalizing school and classroom curricula and preparing students\
  \ for an interconnected world. Through these exchanges, K-12 educators become leaders\
  \ in global education, which is integral to building students\u2019 skills for the\
  \ 21st  century."
