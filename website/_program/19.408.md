objective: As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and
  Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people
  of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and
  cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals,
  students, and educators. ECA programs foster engagement and encourage dialogue with
  citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is premised on the
  knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future leaders, and the
  benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making
  almost everywhere in the world today. ECA programs inform, engage, and influence
  participants across strategic sectors of society – including young people, women,
  teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals – increasing the number
  of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience with Americans and with the
  values of freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic choice, and
  individual dignity, while building international knowledge and capacity among Americans.
  The purpose of the Teacher Exchange programs is to provide K-12 educators from the
  United States and around the world with the opportunity to enhance their teaching,
  leadership and technology skills through professional development and exchange.
  Educators participate in seminars, teach, observe best practices, pursue individualized
  research and develop courses with the goal of globalizing school and classroom curricula
  and preparing students for an interconnected world. Through these exchanges, K-12
  educators become leaders in global education, which is integral to building students’
  skills for the 21st  century.  The Community College Administrators Program improves
  technical and vocational education at the post-secondary level by bringing high-level
  college administrators and officials with higher education planning responsibilities
  to the United States for a six-week professional development seminar. The Program
  examines the key tenets of community college administration and cutting-edge programs
  at U.S. community colleges that address local workforce development needs.
