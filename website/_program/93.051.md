objective: "To expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons\
  \ with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), their families, and their\
  \ caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based\
  \ care system to persons with dementia.\r\n\r\nADSSPS grantees continue to implement\
  \ two types of ADSSP projects, dementia capability and translation projects. Dementia\
  \ capability grants require states to help ensure that people with dementia and\
  \ their family caregivers have access to a home and community-based services system.\
  \  Such a system identifies those with dementia, ensures that program staff have\
  \ appropriate dementia care training, and assures delivery of quality home and community-based\
  \ services. Evidence-based grants require states to demonstrate how existing evidence-based\
  \ interventions designed to help people with ADRD and their family caregivers can\
  \ be translated into effective supportive service programs at the community level.\r\
