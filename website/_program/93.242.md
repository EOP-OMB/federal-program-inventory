objective: "The mission of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to transform\
  \ the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical\
  \ research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.       \n\nWe fulfill\
  \ this mission by supporting and conducting research on mental illnesses, health\
  \ services, and the underlying basic science of the brain and behavior; supporting\
  \ the training of scientists to carry out basic and clinical mental health research;\
  \ and communicating with scientists, patients, providers, and the public about mental\
  \ health research advances and priorities.\n\nIn May 2024, NIMH released its Strategic\
  \ Plan for Research.  The Strategic Plan builds on the successes of previous NIMH\
  \ strategic plans by providing a framework for scientific research and exploration,\
  \ and addressing new challenges in mental health.\n\nThe new Strategic Plan outlines\
  \ four high-level Goals: \n• Goal 1: Define the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Complex\
  \ Behaviors\n• Goal 2: Examine Mental Illness Trajectories Across the Lifespan\n\
  • Goal 3: Strive for Prevention and Cures\n• Goal 4: Strengthen the Public Health\
  \ Impact of NIMH-Supported Research\n\nThese four Goals form a broad roadmap for\
  \ the Institute’s research priorities over the next five years, beginning with the\
  \ fundamental science of the brain and behavior, and extending through evidence-based\
  \ services that improve public health outcomes."
