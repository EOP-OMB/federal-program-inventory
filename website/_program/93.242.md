objective: "The mission of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to transform\
  \ the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical\
  \ research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.  \n\nIn May 2020,\
  \ NIMH released its new Strategic Plan for Research.  The new Strategic Plan builds\
  \ on the successes of previous NIMH strategic plans by providing a framework for\
  \ scientific research and exploration, and addressing new challenges in mental health.\n\
  \nThe new Strategic Plan outlines four high-level Goals: \n\u2022 Goal 1: Define\
  \ the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Complex Behaviors\n\u2022 Goal 2: Examine Mental\
  \ Illness Trajectories Across the Lifespan\n\u2022 Goal 3: Strive for Prevention\
  \ and Cures\n\u2022 Goal 4: Strengthen the Public Health Impact of NIMH-Supported\
  \ Research\n\nThese four Goals form a broad roadmap for the Institute\u2019s research\
  \ priorities over the next five years, beginning with the fundamental science of\
  \ the brain and behavior, and extending through evidence-based services that improve\
  \ public health outcomes. The Institute\u2019s overall funding strategy is to support\
  \ a broad spectrum of investigator-initiated research in fundamental science, with\
  \ increasing use of Institute-solicited initiatives for applied research where public\
  \ health impact is a short-term measure of success.  \n\nThe new Strategic Plan\
  \ also addresses a number of cross-cutting themes that are relevant to all research\
  \ supported by NIMH; these themes highlight areas where NIMH-funded science may\
  \ have the greatest impact, bridge gaps, and offer novel approaches to accelerate\
  \ advances in mental health research. For example, NIMH values a comprehensive research\
  \ agenda that takes an inclusive approach that ensures research interests are varied,\
  \ maintain diverse participation and partnerships, and achieve research goals across\
  \ multiple timeframes. This includes diverse methodologies, tools, and models; research\
  \ addressing complex basic, translational, and applied questions; research including\
  \ both sexes and, as appropriate, genetic background; and, participants from diverse\
  \ racial and ethnic backgrounds, and across gender identities, geographical context,\
  \ socioeconomic status, neurotype, and age \u2013 offering the best possible representation,\
  \ for the broadest number of individuals who may ultimately benefit from these scientific\
  \ advances.\n\nTo accomplish the Goals outlined in the new Strategic Plan, NIMH\
  \ will support research that aims:\n\nTo characterize the genomic, molecular, cellular,\
  \ and circuit components contributing to brain organization and function; to identify\
  \ the developmental, functional, and regulatory mechanisms relevant to cognitive,\
  \ affective, and social domains, across units of analysis; and, to generate and\
  \ validate novel tools, techniques, and measures to quantify changes in the activity\
  \ of molecules, cells, circuits, and connectomes. \n\nTo discover gene variants\
  \ and other genomic elements that contribute to the development of mental illnesses\
  \ in diverse populations; to advance our understanding of the complex etiology of\
  \ mental illnesses using molecular epidemiologic approaches that incorporate individual\
  \ genetic information in large cohorts; to elucidate how human genetic variation\
  \ affects the coordination of molecular, cellular, and physiological networks supporting\
  \ higher-order functions and emergent properties of neurobiological systems; and,\
  \ to develop novel tools and techniques for the analysis of large-scale genetic,\
  \ multi-omic data as it applies to mental health. \n\nTo utilize connectomic approaches\
  \ to identify brain networks and circuit components that contribute to various aspects\
  \ of mental function and dysfunction; to determine through brain-wide analysis how\
  \ changes in the physiological properties of molecules, cells, and circuits contribute\
  \ to mental illnesses; to develop molecular, cellular, and circuit-level biomarkers\
  \ of impaired neural function in humans; and, to develop innovative technologies,\
  \ \u2013 including new imaging, computational, pharmacological, and genetic tools\
  \ \u2013 to interrogate and modulate circuit activity and structure altered in mental\
  \ illnesses. \n\nTo elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the trajectories of\
  \ brain development and behavior; and, to characterize the emergence and progression\
  \ of mental illnesses, and identifying sensitive periods for optimal intervention.\
  \ \n\nTo determine early risk and protective factors, and related mechanisms, to\
  \ serve as novel intervention groups; and, to develop reliable and robust biomarkers\
  \ and assessment tools to predict illness onset, course, and across diverse populations.\
  \ \n\nTo develop novel interventions using a mechanism-informed, experimental therapeutics\
  \ approach; and, to develop and implement measurement strategies to facilitate mechanism-based\
  \ intervention development and testing. \n\nTo investigate personalized intervention\
  \ strategies across disease progression and development; and, to develop and refine\
  \ computational approaches and research designs that can be used to inform and test\
  \ personalized interventions. \n\nTo develop and test approaches for adapting, combining,\
  \ and sequencing interventions to achieve the greatest impact on the lives and functioning\
  \ of persons seeking care; to conduct efficient pragmatic trials that employ new\
  \ tools to rapidly identify, engage, assess, and follow participants in the context\
  \ of routine care; and, to enhance the practical relevance of effectiveness research\
  \ via deployment-focused, hybrid, effectiveness-implementation studies. \n\nTo employ\
  \ assessment platforms within healthcare systems to accurately assess the distribution\
  \ and determinants of mental illnesses and to inform strategies for improved services;\
  \ to optimize real-world data collection systems to identify strategies for improving\
  \ access, quality, effectiveness, and continuity of mental health services; and,\
  \ to compare alternative financing models to promote effective and efficient care\
  \ for individuals with serious emotional disturbances and serious mental illnesses.\
  \ \n\nTo strengthen partnerships with key stakeholders to develop and validate strategies\
  \ for implementing, sustaining, and continuously improve evidence-based practices;\
  \ to build models to scale-up evidence-based practices for use in public and private\
  \ primary care, specialty care and other settings; and, to develop decision-support\
  \ tools and technologies that increase the effectiveness and continuous improvement\
  \ of mental health interventions in public and private primary care, specialty care,\
  \ and other settings. \n\nTo adapt, validate, and scale-up programs currently in\
  \ use that improve mental health services for underserved populations; to develop\
  \ and validate service delivery models that provide evidence-based care for individuals\
  \ throughout the course of mental illness; to develop and validate systems-level\
  \ strategies using technology and other approaches, to identify, support, and monitor\
  \ the effectiveness of evidence-based care throughout the course of illness; and,\
  \ to develop and validate decision-making models that bridge mental health, medical,\
  \ and other care settings to integrate the appropriate care for people with serious\
  \ mental illnesses and comorbid medical conditions."
