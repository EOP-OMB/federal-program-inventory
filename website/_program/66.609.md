objective: To support efforts by organizations; educational institutions; and/or State,
  local, and tribal governmental agencies to establish or enhance their ability to
  take actions that will reduce environmental risks to the health of children.  Since
  1997, when the Office of Children’s Health Protection was established, EPA has focused
  on children’s health protection, undertaking a variety of efforts to improve the
  environments where children live, learn and play. EPA has sponsored research to
  evaluate the impacts of environmental exposures on children’s health, ensured that
  children’s health protection is a key component of our risk assessments and regulatory
  decision-making, and supported efforts to promote the measurement and tracking of
  environmental health disparities. EPA has launched projects to improve school environments,
  promote healthy homes, address indoor and outdoor air quality, and reduce children’s
  exposures to chemicals, pesticides, and radiation. EPA has developed tools to enable
  citizens, communities, governmental and non-governmental agencies to take steps
  toward  protecting children from environmental health threats. EPA has worked with
  healthcare providers to identify, prevent and reduce environmental threat to children.
  EPA has also provided international leadership in the protection of children worldwide.
  EPA’s partnerships with other federal agencies; state and local governments; tribes;
  nongovernmental organizations; healthcare providers; academia; and others are essential
  to achieving our children’s health protection goals. It is only through our combined
  efforts that we can achieve the goals of making the health protection of children
  a fundamental goal of public health and environmental protection.
