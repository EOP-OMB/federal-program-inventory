objective: "To support efforts by organizations; educational institutions; and/or\
  \ State, local, and tribal governmental agencies to establish or enhance their ability\
  \ to take actions that will reduce environmental risks to the health of children.\
  \  Since 1997, when the Office of Children\u2019s Health Protection was established,\
  \ EPA has focused on children\u2019s health protection, undertaking a variety of\
  \ efforts to improve the environments where children live, learn and play. EPA has\
  \ sponsored research to evaluate the impacts of environmental exposures on children\u2019\
  s health, ensured that children\u2019s health protection is a key component of our\
  \ risk assessments and regulatory decision-making, and supported efforts to promote\
  \ the measurement and tracking of environmental health disparities. EPA has launched\
  \ projects to improve school environments, promote healthy homes, address indoor\
  \ and outdoor air quality, and reduce children\u2019s exposures to chemicals, pesticides,\
  \ and radiation. EPA has developed tools to enable citizens, communities, governmental\
  \ and non-governmental agencies to take steps toward  protecting children from environmental\
  \ health threats. EPA has worked with healthcare providers to identify, prevent\
  \ and reduce environmental threat to children. EPA has also provided international\
  \ leadership in the protection of children worldwide. EPA\u2019s partnerships with\
  \ other federal agencies; state and local governments; tribes; nongovernmental organizations;\
  \ healthcare providers; academia; and others are essential to achieving our children\u2019\
  s health protection goals. It is only through our combined efforts that we can achieve\
  \ the goals of making the health protection of children a fundamental goal of public\
  \ health and environmental protection."
