objective: 'Program activities support integrated viral hepatitis surveillance and
  prevention programs in states and large cities in the United States. Key strategies
  include viral hepatitis outbreak planning and response; and surveillance for acute
  hepatitis A, B and C, and chronic hepatitis C. Partners should develop a jurisdictional
  viral hepatitis elimination plan, increase comprehensive hepatitis B and C reporting,
  improve HBV and HCV testing and increase healthcare providers trained to treat hepatitis
  B and C. Contingent on funding, the following activities can be supported: surveillance
  for chronic hepatitis B and perinatal hepatitis C; increased hepatitis B and C testing
  and referral to care in high-impact settings (syringe services programs (SSPs),
  substance use disorder (SUD) treatment centers, correctional facilities, emergency
  departments and sexually transmitted disease clinics; and increased access to services
  preventing viral hepatitis and other infections among persons who inject drugs (PWID).
  Contingent on funding, an optional component will support improved access to prevention,
  diagnosis, and treatment of viral, bacterial and fungal infections related to drug
  use in settings disproportionately affected by drug use. Expected outcomes include
  improved surveillance for viral hepatitis, increased stakeholder engagement in viral
  hepatitis elimination planning, and improved access to viral hepatitis prevention,
  diagnosis, and treatment among populations most at risk.'
