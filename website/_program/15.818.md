objective: 'To advance the scientific understanding of volcanic processes and to lessen
  the harmful impacts of volcanic activity. The Volcano Hazards Program (VHP) monitors
  active and potentially active volcanoes, assesses their hazards, responds to volcanic
  crises, and conducts research on how volcanoes work to fulfill a Congressional mandate
  (Public Law 93-288) that the USGS issue "timely warnings" of potential volcanic
  hazards to responsible emergency-management authorities and to the populace affected.
  VHP provides domestic assistance in order to expand the expertise and capabilities
  applied to fulfilling its mission. '
