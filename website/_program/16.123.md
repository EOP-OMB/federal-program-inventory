objective: "Goals:   To eliminate youth gun and gang violence \n\nObjectives:  The\
  \ Community-Based Violence Prevention (CBVP) Program helps states and localities\
  \ support a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach to community youth gun and\
  \ gang violence through prevention, intervention, suppression, and reentry in targeted\
  \ communities.  The CBVP Program is designed to support and enhance programs and\
  \ approaches that replicate models that have been proven to have a positive impact\
  \ on the reduction of violence in target communities. Toward achievement of the\
  \ ultimate goal of eliminating community violence, the CBVP Program has three main\
  \ objectives: to change community norms regarding violence; to provide alternatives\
  \ to violence when gangs and individuals in the community are making risky behavior\
  \ decisions; and, to increase awareness of the perceived risks and costs of involvement\
  \ in violence among high-risk young people. The CBVP Program supports effective\
  \ use of focused deterrence (enforcement) strategies and public health and education\
  \ approaches to stop violence. This will be accomplished by supporting communities\
  \ to establish and strengthen partnerships between law enforcement and outreach\
  \ workers, clergy, community leaders and family members in efforts to deter young\
  \ people from committing violence, particularly shootings and killings.  The CBVP\
  \ Program also calls for the strengthening of communities so they have the capacity\
  \ to exercise social controls and to respond to issues that affect community violence.\n\
  \nThe performance measures associated with these objectives are:\n\nPM 1: Number\
  \ of individuals\nserved (by population)\n\nPM 2: Percentage of eligible\nindividuals\
  \ served by a\nprevention service\n\nPM 3: Percentage of eligible\nindividuals served\
  \ by an\nintervention service"
