objective: 'EPA will award interagency and cooperative agreements to study the chemical
  and ecological response to pollution reduction and emissions control programs. The
  programs will assist in understanding biogeochemical changes in sulfur, nitrogen,
  aluminum, and carbon in streams and lakes in relation to changing pollutant emissions
  and deposition, as well as other factors, such as potential environmental changes
  (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and storm frequency and intensity). Clean Air
  Act section 103(b)(3) authorizes EPA to conduct and promote the coordination and
  acceleration of research, investigations, experiments, demonstrations, surveys,
  and studies relating to the causes, effects (including health and welfare effects),
  extent, prevention and control of air pollution. Clean Water Act section 104(b)(2)
  authorizes EPA to cooperate with other Federal Departments and Agencies to conduct
  and promote the coordination and acceleration of research investigations, experiments,
  trainings, demonstrations, surveys and studies relating to the causes, effects,
  extent, prevention, reduction and elimination of pollution.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  The LTM program will support initiatives
  that demonstrate the potential for tracking and understanding the chemical and ecological
  response to air pollution reduction programs in acid-sensitive regions of the eastern
  United States. Funding will be available for applicants that demonstrate the ability
  to provide consistent, reliable, quality-assured data from lakes and streams for
  a variety of surface water chemistry parameters (e.g., pH, sulfate and nitrate concentrations,
  acid neutralizing capacity, aluminum concentrations, base cations, etc.).'

    project performance and financial obligations monitoring small headwaters streams
    in undeveloped watersheds; monitoring of lakes smaller than four hectares with
    low acid neutralizing capacity levels in acid-sensitive regions; and monitoring
    of lake and stream sulfate and nitrate concentrations in acid-sensitive regions
    of the eastern U.S. The LTM program is responsible for one of the longest continuous
    water quality data records in EPA history and constitutes a unique resource for
    environmental science. Data collected from these programs are used to characterize
    how the most sensitive aquatic systems in each region are responding to changing
    air pollution, as well as giving information on seasonal and episodic chemistry
    and environmental change.
