objective: "The purpose of this program is to prevent and reduce the abuse of opioids\
  \ or methamphetamines and the abuse of prescription medications among youth ages\
  \ 12-18 in communities throughout the United States\r\n\r\nGrants awarded through\
  \ the CARA Act are intended as an enhancement to current or formerly funded Drug-Free\
  \ Communities (DFC) Support Program grant award recipients as established community-based\
  \ youth substance use prevention coalitions capable of effecting community-level\
  \ change.  For the purposes of this FOA and the DFC Support Program, a coalition\
  \ is defined as a community-based formal arrangement for cooperation and collaboration\
  \ among groups or sectors of a community in which each group retains its identity,\
  \ but all agree to work together toward a common goal of building a safe, healthy,\
  \ and drug-free community.  CARA grant award recipients, also referred to as \u201C\
  recipients,\u201D are expected to conduct the day-to-day operations of the grant\
  \ program.  CARA recipients are not permitted to serve as a conduit for CARA funds\
  \ passing through them or to another agency.\r\n\r\nCoalitions receiving CARA Act\
  \ funds, as current or formerly funded DFC recipients, are expected to work with\
  \ leaders in their communities to identify and address local youth opioid, methamphetamine,\
  \ and/or prescription medication abuse and create sustainable community-level change.\
  \  Additionally, recipients are expected to implement comprehensive community-wide\
  \ strategies.\r\n"
