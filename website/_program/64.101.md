cfda: '64.101'
objective: To provide a monetary allowance not to exceed $796, or that amount authorized
  under 38 U.S.C. 2303 whichever is greater, toward the plot or interment expense
  for certain Veterans not buried in a national cemetery. Up to $300 as a burial allowance
  is payable toward the burial expense of certain Veterans. Payable rates are higher
  if the Veteran was hospitalized by VA at time of death. If death is the result of
  a service-connected disability, payments can be made to reimburse burial and funeral
  expenses not to exceed $2,000 or that amount authorized under 5 U.S.C. 8134(a) whichever
  is greater. In addition to the statutory burial allowance, the cost of transporting
  the Veterans' remains from place of death to site of burial is paid by VA if death
  occurs in a VA facility. The cost of transporting the remains from place of death
  to the national cemetery in which space is available nearest the Veteran's last
  place of residence may also be paid if death was due to service-connected disability,
  or at the time of death the Veteran was in receipt of or was entitled to receive
  disability compensation but for the receipt of military retired pay or non-service-connected
  disability pension and burial is in a national cemetery. A headstone or marker may
  be authorized. Also, an American flag to drape the casket of a Veteran may be provided.
