objective: If the Veteran died on or after October 1, 2023, VA will provide a monetary
  allowance not to exceed $948, or that amount authorized under 38 U.S.C. 2303 whichever
  is greater, toward the plot or interment expense for certain Veterans not buried
  in a national cemetery with a non-service-connected death. Up to $948 as a burial
  allowance is payable toward the burial expense of certain Veterans. If death is
  the result of a service-connected disability, payments can be made to reimburse
  burial and funeral expenses not to exceed $2,000 or that amount authorized under
  5 U.S.C. 8134(a) whichever is greater. In addition to the statutory burial allowance,
  the cost of transporting the Veterans' remains from place of death to site of burial
  is paid by VA if death occurs in a VA facility. The cost of transporting the remains
  from place of death for burial in a national cemetery or a covered Veteransâ€™ cemetery,
  such payment shall not exceed the cost of transportation to the national cemetery
  nearest the Veteran's last place of residence. Transportation benefits may also
  be paid if death was due to service-connected disability, or at the time of death
  the Veteran was in receipt of or was entitled to receive disability compensation
  but for the receipt of military retired pay or non-service-connected disability
  pension and burial is in a national cemetery. A headstone or marker may be authorized.
  If the Veteran died on or after October 1, 2021, the maximum headstone or marker
  allowance is $231. Also, an American flag to drape the casket of a Veteran may be
  provided.
