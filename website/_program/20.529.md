objective: The purpose of the program is to provide assistance for testing new transit
  bus models and reporting on their maintainability, reliability, safety, performance
  (including braking performance), structural integrity, fuel economy, emissions,
  and noise performance characteristics. Per 49 U.S.C Section 5318(e), amounts appropriated
  or otherwise made available under this chapter may be obligated or expended to acquire
  a new bus model only if that model is tested at the Bus Testing Facility and the
  bus achieved a passing test score based upon the performance standards for maintainability,
  reliability, performance (including braking performance), structural integrity,
  fuel economy, emissions, noise, and safety. The program is administered under FTA’s
  implementing regulation at 49 CFR Part 665, commonly referred to as the Bus Testing
  Regulation.

- description: 'The Bus Testing Facility will conduct standardized tests and prepare
    test reports for up to twenty new transit bus models and will also bring a compressed
    hydrogen fueling station on-line in June of 2016 to enable the testing of new
    hydrogen fuel cell bus models. Overall, the Bus Testing Program has proven to
    be valuable to the transit industry. As of March 31, 2016 testing has been completed
    on 444 buses with a total of 9,324 bus failure modes were identified since the
    program’s inception. Of those failure modes, 44 could have resulted in serious
    injuries or significant property damage had they occurred in revenue service.
    Another 175 failure modes would have resulted in the bus being stranded on its
    route had they occurred in actual service. Many of the other malfunctions identified
    would adversely impact transit service (e.g., resulting in road calls stranding
    passengers), and all would increase maintenance costs by requiring corrective
    maintenance actions. The Bus Testing Program ensures that by testing new bus models
    before they are purchased, recipients and manufacturers can often address problems
    before the fleet is built, potentially saving the federal government and grant
    recipients considerable money and time and avoiding inconveniencing passengers.

    6 full, and 5 partial bus testing reports for buses that started testing in calendar
    year 2017.
  year: '2017'
- description: The Bus Testing Program applies to recipients of FTA capital assistance
    who purchase new model transit buses or existing bus models being produced with
    a major change.   As of December 31, 2017, testing was completed on 469 buses
    with over 9,500 bus failures identified.  Of those failures, 46 could have resulted
    in serious injuries or significant property damage had they occurred in revenue
    service.  Many of the other malfunctions would adversely impact transit service
    (e.g., resulting in road calls standing passengers), and all would increase maintenance
