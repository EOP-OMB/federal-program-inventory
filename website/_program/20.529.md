objective: "The purpose of the program is to provide assistance for testing new transit\
  \ bus models and reporting on their maintainability, reliability, safety, performance\
  \ (including braking performance), structural integrity, fuel economy, emissions,\
  \ and noise performance characteristics. Per 49 U.S.C Section 5318(e), amounts appropriated\
  \ or otherwise made available under this chapter may be obligated or expended to\
  \ acquire a new bus model only if that model is tested at the Bus Testing Facility\
  \ and the bus achieved a passing test score based upon the performance standards\
  \ for maintainability, reliability, performance (including braking performance),\
  \ structural integrity, fuel economy, emissions, noise, and safety. The program\
  \ is administered under FTA\u2019s implementing regulation at 49 CFR Part 665, commonly\
  \ referred to as the Bus Testing Regulation."
