objective: 'The goals of the CWD Program are to decrease the cybersecurity workforce
  shortage and equity gap by increasing the pipeline of future cybersecurity professionals
  through workforce development and develop non-traditional training providers’ capacity
  in cybersecurity workforce development to support their long-term success. The CWD
  Program supports Goal 3: Secure Cyberspace and Critical Infrastructure in the Department
  of Homeland Security Strategic Plan 2020-2024 and Goal 1: Cyber Defense in the CISA
  Strategic Plan 2023-2024. To achieve these goals, a CWD Program cooperative agreement
  will have three objectives: (1) implement an engaging training hub (virtual, in
  person, or a hybrid combination) covering both national and regional cybersecurity
  challenges to deliver cybersecurity training to a target audience of underserved
  communities and connect participants and employers in one or more CISA regions;
  (2) implement an apprenticeship and/or placement program for entry-level cybersecurity
  professionals that is supported by affiliations with cybersecurity entities who
  may support program enrollees and/or graduates; and (3) place training program graduates
  into full-time, entry-level cybersecurity jobs.'
