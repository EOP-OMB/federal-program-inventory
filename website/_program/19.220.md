objective: The U.S. Ambassadors' Special Self-Help program is a grass-roots assistance
  program that allows U.S. embassies to respond quickly to local requests for small
  community-based development projects. This Self-Help fund provides small, short-term
  grants to community groups that are working to improve the basic economic and social
  conditions of their communities.  Special Self-Help projects help to improve basic
  economic or social conditions at the local community, or village level, and have
  long-lived value.
