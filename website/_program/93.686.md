objective: In February 2019, the Administration announced a new initiative, Ending
  the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE). This initiative, which began in FY 2020, seeks
  to achieve the important goal of reducing new HIV infections in the United States
  to less than 3,000 per year by 2030. The first phase of this initiative focuses
  resources in 48 counties, Washington, D.C., San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR), and seven
  states with substantial rural HIV burden (hereafter referred to as ‘jurisdictions’)
  to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and
  services to achieve the goals of the initiative.
