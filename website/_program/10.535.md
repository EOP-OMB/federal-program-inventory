objective: The purpose of the SNAP Fraud Framework Implementation Grant Program is
  to support State agency efforts to improve and expand recipient fraud prevention,
  detection and investigation efforts using the procedures, ideas and practices outlined
  in the SNAP Fraud Framework. In response to the increase in SNAP benefit theft,
  FNS is strongly encouraging States to submit proposals that aim to prevent, detect,
  and respond to false application or certification attempts, phishing, and card skimming
  schemes.
