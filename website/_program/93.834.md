objective: To reduce morbidity and mortality by preventing cases and complications
  of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases by building the capacity of healthcare
  organizations, community based organizations, and State and local health departments.
  Grants and cooperative agreements may be for (1) training, technical assistance,
  or information dissemination; (2) HIV testing and diagnosis; (3) interventions and
  strategies that support targeted HIV prevention and the HIV care continuum; and
  (4) use of data for program quality improvement. Project grants under Section 318c
  awarded to State and local health departments emphasize the development and implementation
  of nationally uniform prevention and control programs which focus on disease intervention
  activities designed to reduce the incidence of these diseases, with applied research,
  demonstration, and public and professional education activities supporting these
  basic program activities authorized under Section 318b of the Public Health Service
  Act.
