objective: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates SFSP in partnership
  with State agencies and local organizations to provide free meals to eligible children
  during the summer months and at other approved times when school is not in session.
  USDA assists States through grants-in-aid and other means to conduct nonprofit food
  service programs for children through the SFSP.

- description: The current FY 2016 estimate projects 177.4 million meals, which would
    be a 5 percent increase above the FY 2015 estimate. FNS will focus on sustaining
    SFSP expansion through targeted efforts at the State and local level, efforts
    to improve access in rural and tribal communities. An increase in SEBTC funding
    in FY 2016 will help participating States reach the large number of low-income
    children who do not have access to SFSP and will enable FNS to evaluate whether
    SEBTC is a viable option to address childhood hunger during the summer over an
    expanded area.  FNS focused on decreasing childhood hunger in the summer months
    through targeted assistance at the State and local level and efforts to improve
    access in rural and tribal communities. During FY 2016, 48,618 meal service sites
    provided 154.5 million meals to children. The number of meals served declined
    5.5 percent from FY 2015. Compared to FY 1990, meals have increased 70.2 percent
    from 91.2 million. Approximately 57.2 percent of the meals served were lunches,
    28.2 percent were breakfasts, and the remaining 14.7 percent were suppers or snacks.
    FNS awarded Summer EBT funding to 2015 grantees to continue and expand their efforts
    to reach more children in rural, tribal, and other areas of significant need.
    Grantees were approved to target benefits to over 250,000 children, nearly 90
    percent more than were served in 2015.
  year: '2016'
- description: During 2017, 151.9 million meals were served to children at 40,386
    sites. In an effort to institutionalize successful strategies, FNS shifted from
    targeting assistance in focus States to promoting sustainable growth nationwide.
  year: '2017'
- description: During FY 2021, about half of the meals normally served and claimed
    under the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs were served and
    claimed under the Summer Food Service Program. School lunches and breakfasts were
    served and claimed under the Summer Food Service Program, which distorts the normal
    meal forecast trajectory.
  year: '2021'
- description: The current estimate projects 158 million meals to be served. This
    represents a decrease of 89 percent below the estimate for FY 2021, when summer
    meals were served outside of the traditional summer operating period in response
    to COVID-19, but an increase above the pre-pandemic level of service of 142 million
    meals in FY 2019.
  year: '2022'
- description: The current estimate for FY 2023 projects 145 million meals will be
    served, which is a decrease of approximately 13 million meals (or 8.3 percent)
    compared to the estimate for FY 2022, but above pre-pandemic service levels
  year: '2023'
- description: FNS anticipates a total of 182 million summer meals served in 2024,
    an increase of 29 million meals (or nearly 19 percent) from the previous year.
  year: '2024'
