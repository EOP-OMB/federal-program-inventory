- description: 'In the area of Safe, Efficient Growth in Global Operations, NASA successfully
    completed demonstrations of Integrated Arrival/Departure/Surface system capabilities
    in two busy airports, Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte. The new system significantly
    improved operational efficiency which reduces fuel burn and emissions. As an example
    of the benefits, at the Charlotte airport, over the period September 2017 to September
    2021, this new capability saved over one million gallons of fuel and over 23 million
    pounds of CO2 emissions. These were the final demonstrations in a series of airspace
    technology demonstrations.

    In Commercial Supersonic Aircraft, NASA made significant progress in the Low-Boom
    Flight Demonstration Mission. The Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator (X-59) aircraft
    began the final stages of assembly. In preparation for the X-59 flight validation
    testing, NASA developed techniques to collect noise and performance data. NASA
    conducted a flight test of a nose mounted shock sensing probe on NASA’s F-15 aircraft
    that will measure shock wave structure.

    NASA’s effort in Ultra-Efficient Subsonic Transports culminated in the Sustainable
    Flight National Partnership to further develop and mature technologies for the
    next generation commercial aircraft. The Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstrations
    (EPFD) project will help to rapidly mature, and transition integrated electrified
    aircraft propulsion technologies for introduction into the global fleet in the
    2030s.

    In the area of In-Time System-Wide Safety assurance, NASA developed techniques
    that process vehicle operating performance data to predict system safety and evaluate
    potential mitigations. NASA demonstrated these predictive techniques for Advanced
    Air Mobility (AAM) vehicles. NASA evaluated the use of a tool to actively monitor
    components while in operation to constrain the behavior of machine learning-enabled
    system components. This evaluation will enable the FAA to develop requirements
    for certification of autonomous systems.

    With industry collaboration, NASA successfully completed development testing for
    the AAM National Campaign (NC) that demonstrated maturity of key systems and infrastructure.
    In support of the NC test series, NASA developed airspace management capabilities
    to enable urban air mobility operations.'

- description: 'In the area of Safe, Efficient Growth in Global Operations, NASA,
    with industry partners, demonstrated a cloud-based trajectory management service
    that enables flight operators to identify efficient departure routes and improve
    the environmental sustainability of air transportation. In collaboration with
    the FAA, NASA created a web-based portal to help develop a vision of NAS operations
    in 2045 with input from a broad set of stakeholders. This process identified critical
    research and development needs. NASA conducted a series of simulations and flight
    tests with industry partners as part of the AAM National Campaign flight demonstrations
    to evaluate system-level safety, integration scenarios, and scalable system concepts.

    In Commercial Supersonic Aircraft, NASA made significant progress on the Quesst
    Mission. The X-59 supersonic aircraft was shipped to a Lockheed Martin facility
    in Fort Worth, TX, where it successfully completed the ground proof loads and
    fuel system checkout tests. NASA conducted sonic boom wind tunnel testing using
    a 1.6 percent scale model of the X-59 quiet supersonic technologies aircraft.
    These wind tunnel tests provided additional experimental data to use along with
    X-59 flight data. NASA conducted flight experiments using test aircraft at the
    Armstrong Flight Research Center to evaluate the initial version of the ground
    level noise recording systems. Evaluating these ground recording systems ensures
    that they are ready to accurately record ground-level noise from X-59 flights.

    In Ultra-Efficient Subsonic Transports, NASA made significant progress on the
    SFNP Mission. NASA tested megawatt (MW)-scale aircraft electrical powertrains
    under flight altitude conditions. This test was the first MW-class electrified
    powertrain testing at the NASA Electric Aircraft Testbed facility. NASA successfully
    completed a Delta System Readiness Review and a flight partner Preliminary Design
    Review for the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstrations project. NASA, in
    collaboration with industry, conducted aerodynamic buffet testing of an advanced
    thin wing Transonic Truss-Braced Wing (TTBW) model to better understand the aerodynamics
    of this concept. NASA and its partners completed design reviews, facility preparations,
    hardware assembly, and a portion of testing for technology development for small-core
    engines. NASA selected an initial set of technologies to enable high-rate composite
    manufacturing.

    In Safe, Quiet, and Affordable Vertical Lift Air Vehicles, NASA made significant
    progress toward the objectives of the AAM Mission. NASA conducted multiple wind
    tunnel experiments of different single-rotor and multi-rotor vertical lift vehicle
    configurations to validate computer-based design methods. NASA completed facility
    upgrades and initiated system testing for components of electric propulsion systems
    for AAM vehicles. Data obtained in the facility will be part of an effort to both
    understand and predict component failure and will provide vital data to regulatory
    agencies, such as the FAA. NASA demonstrated improved computer-based tools for
    predicting and evaluating the noise and performance of AAM vehicle configurations.
    These efforts benefited the AAM community by providing design tools and guidelines
    that increase the likelihood that their new aircraft designs will meet noise goals
    before the development and construction of a full-scale vehicle.

    In the area of In-Time System-Wide Safety assurance, NASA completed research that
    produced several tools and techniques for the verification and validation of critical
    aviation software systems. Industry partners helped to evaluate these tools, which
    were shown to significantly reduce verification and validation costs. With industry
    collaboration, NASA successfully completed development testing for the AAM National
    Campaign (NC) that demonstrated maturity of key systems and infrastructure. In
    support of the NC test series, NASA developed airspace management capabilities
    to enable urban air mobility operations.

    In Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation, NASA engaged with industry to
    develop and evaluate novel air traffic management capabilities for AAM vehicles
    in flight. These capabilities were rigorously validated in a controlled environment
    and were transitioned for use in field demonstrations. NASA delivered draft evidence
    and recommendations on the use of run-time monitoring for automated components
    and the robustness of remote operators as a backup in case of automation failure
    to industry standards committees and safety and regulatory partners.'

- description: 'In the area of airspace operations and safety, NASA with industry
    partners developed and evaluated novel air traffic management capabilities for
    advanced air mobility (AAM) vehicles in flight. These capabilities were validated
    in a controlled environment and were transitioned for use in field demonstrations.
    Version 2.0 of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Airspace Research Roadmap was published.
    Through simulation and flight testing, NASA demonstrated automated aircraft vertiport
    operations involving automated small UAS flying nominal and off-nominal approach
    and landing operational scenarios that aligned with the UAM Concept of Operations.

    In advanced air vehicles program, NASA in collaboration with industry, demonstrated
    megawatt (MW)-class electric motors at simulated altitude conditions and integrated
    electrified systems for transport-class aircraft. These demonstrations included
    the flight-weight and flight-like components required to bring the technology
    to flight. Further, the system met safety requirements for fault management, redundancy,
    and power quality needed for use on commercial transports. This approach will
    enable future transports to use hybrid propulsion technologies for aircraft efficiency
    benefits. NASA designed, built, tested, and evaluated an aircraft fuselage segment
    fabricated with a suite of novel manufacturing technologies in a relevant environment
    that can improve high-rate, lightweight metallic fuselage manufacturing. The demonstration
    validated improvements to fasteners such as reduced weight, assembly time, and
    less crack initiation. New metallic manufacturing processes enhanced sustainability
    while reducing weight and cost and improving manufacturing rates.

    In transformative aeronautics concepts program, NASA completed the first flights
    of the Shape Memory Alloy Reconfigurable Technology Vortex Generators on the Boeing
    eco-Demonstrator 777-200ER, which seeks to make aviation more sustainable and
    fuel-efficient by decreasing drag in flight and thereby reduce aviation''s environmental
    impact. The completed test results displayed favorable performance at a range
    of operational conditions, confirming a computational fluid dynamic drag analysis
    that predicted reduced overall drag on the airplane, in turn allowing engines
    to work more efficiently, saving fuel and releasing fewer emissions. NASA developed
    a new alloy, GRX-810, which endures higher temperatures, is more malleable, and
    significantly increases durability than existing state-of-the-art alloys. The
    NASA used GRX-810 on combustor domes for rocket injectors. The GRX-810 had no
    significant damage after 39 hours of testing, allowing for future sustainable
    flight engines with less harmful environmental impacts.'
