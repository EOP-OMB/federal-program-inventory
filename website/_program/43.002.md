- description: 'In the area of Safe, Efficient Growth in Global Operations, NASA,
    with industry partners, demonstrated a cloud-based trajectory management service
    that enables flight operators to identify efficient departure routes and improve
    the environmental sustainability of air transportation. In collaboration with
    the FAA, NASA created a web-based portal to help develop a vision of NAS operations
    in 2045 with input from a broad set of stakeholders. This process identified critical
    research and development needs. NASA conducted a series of simulations and flight
    tests with industry partners as part of the AAM National Campaign flight demonstrations
    to evaluate system-level safety, integration scenarios, and scalable system concepts.

    In Commercial Supersonic Aircraft, NASA made significant progress on the Quesst
    Mission. The X-59 supersonic aircraft was shipped to a Lockheed Martin facility
    in Fort Worth, TX, where it successfully completed the ground proof loads and
    fuel system checkout tests. NASA conducted sonic boom wind tunnel testing using
    a 1.6 percent scale model of the X-59 quiet supersonic technologies aircraft.
    These wind tunnel tests provided additional experimental data to use along with
    X-59 flight data. NASA conducted flight experiments using test aircraft at the
    Armstrong Flight Research Center to evaluate the initial version of the ground
    level noise recording systems. Evaluating these ground recording systems ensures
    that they are ready to accurately record ground-level noise from X-59 flights.

    In Ultra-Efficient Subsonic Transports, NASA made significant progress on the
    SFNP Mission. NASA tested megawatt (MW)-scale aircraft electrical powertrains
    under flight altitude conditions. This test was the first MW-class electrified
    powertrain testing at the NASA Electric Aircraft Testbed facility. NASA successfully
    completed a Delta System Readiness Review and a flight partner Preliminary Design
    Review for the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstrations project. NASA, in
    collaboration with industry, conducted aerodynamic buffet testing of an advanced
    thin wing Transonic Truss-Braced Wing (TTBW) model to better understand the aerodynamics
    of this concept. NASA and its partners completed design reviews, facility preparations,
    hardware assembly, and a portion of testing for technology development for small-core
    engines. NASA selected an initial set of technologies to enable high-rate composite
    manufacturing.

    In Safe, Quiet, and Affordable Vertical Lift Air Vehicles, NASA made significant
    progress toward the objectives of the AAM Mission. NASA conducted multiple wind
    tunnel experiments of different single-rotor and multi-rotor vertical lift vehicle
    configurations to validate computer-based design methods. NASA completed facility
    upgrades and initiated system testing for components of electric propulsion systems
    for AAM vehicles. Data obtained in the facility will be part of an effort to both
    understand and predict component failure and will provide vital data to regulatory
    agencies, such as the FAA. NASA demonstrated improved computer-based tools for
    predicting and evaluating the noise and performance of AAM vehicle configurations.
    These efforts benefited the AAM community by providing design tools and guidelines
    that increase the likelihood that their new aircraft designs will meet noise goals
    before the development and construction of a full-scale vehicle.

    In the area of In-Time System-Wide Safety assurance, NASA completed research that
    produced several tools and techniques for the verification and validation of critical
    aviation software systems. Industry partners helped to evaluate these tools, which
    were shown to significantly reduce verification and validation costs. With industry
    collaboration, NASA successfully completed development testing for the AAM National
    Campaign (NC) that demonstrated maturity of key systems and infrastructure. In
    support of the NC test series, NASA developed airspace management capabilities
    to enable urban air mobility operations.

    In Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation, NASA engaged with industry to
    develop and evaluate novel air traffic management capabilities for AAM vehicles
    in flight. These capabilities were rigorously validated in a controlled environment
    and were transitioned for use in field demonstrations. NASA delivered draft evidence
    and recommendations on the use of run-time monitoring for automated components
    and the robustness of remote operators as a backup in case of automation failure
    to industry standards committees and safety and regulatory partners.'
