    \ behaviors associated with crashes (i.e. distracted driving), continued development\
    \ and deployment of connected transportation systems and research into areas relating\

    \ FMCSA will place significant emphasis on the improvement of commercial vehicle\
    \ safety in-line with the strategies contained within the Department of Transportation\u2019\
    s National Roadway Safety Strategy (NRSS). This also includes renewed emphasis\
    \ on areas where CMV and public safety intersect, such as combatting human trafficking\
