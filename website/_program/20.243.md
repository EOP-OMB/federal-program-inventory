    \ behaviors associated with crashes (i.e. distracted driving), continued development\
    \ and deployment of connected transportation systems and research into areas relating\
    \ to crash prevention as core parts of its FY 2023 HP Grant. \n\nIn addition,\
    \ FMCSA will place significant emphasis on the improvement of commercial vehicle\
    \ safety in-line with the strategies contained within the Department of Transportationâ€™s\
    \ National Roadway Safety Strategy (NRSS). This also includes renewed emphasis\
    \ on areas where CMV and public safety intersect, such as combatting human trafficking\
    \ and drug interdiction."
