objective: To assist States, through grants-in-aid and other means, to initiate and
  maintain nonprofit food service programs for children and elderly or impaired adults
  enrolled in nonresidential day care facilities, children attending afterschool care
  programs in low-income areas, and children residing in emergency shelters. The United
  States Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates CACFP in partnership with State
  administering agencies to provide aid to child and adult care sponsoring organizations,
  centers, and day care homes for the provision of nutritious foods that contribute
  to the wellness, healthy growth, and development of young children, and the health
  and wellness of older adults and chronically impaired disabled persons. Funds are
  also made available to the States for expenses associated with CACFP administration.
