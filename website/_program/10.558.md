objective: To assist States, through grants-in-aid and other means, to initiate and
  maintain nonprofit food service programs for children and elderly or impaired adults
  enrolled in nonresidential day care facilities, children attending afterschool care
  programs in low-income areas, and children residing in emergency shelters. The United
  States Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates CACFP in partnership with State
  administering agencies to provide aid to child and adult care sponsoring organizations,
  centers, and day care homes for the provision of nutritious foods that contribute
  to the wellness, healthy growth, and development of young children, and the health
  and wellness of older adults and chronically impaired disabled persons. Funds are
  also made available to the States for expenses associated with CACFP administration.

    in centers, with most of the growth in free meals (23.5 million increase, or 2.3
    percent) plus paid meals (7.9 million increase over FY 2015, or a 2.2 percent
    increase). Tier I day care homes continue a modest increase, with a 0.3 percent

    4.3 million children and 500,000 adult participants. A child care center cared
    for and fed approximately 54 children on an average day and received $37,086 a
    year in meal reimbursement through CACFP. A family day care home cared for and
    fed approximately 7 children on an average day and received slightly more than
    $7,046 a year in meal reimbursement. The number of at-risk afterschool care centers
    in CACFP rose 15 percent from FY 2015, with an average of 70 children daily.  '
