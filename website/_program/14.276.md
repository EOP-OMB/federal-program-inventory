objective: The goal of the Youth Homeless Demonstration Program (YHDP) is to support
  selected communities in the development and implementation of a coordinated community
  approach to preventing and ending youth homelessness and sharing that experience
  with and mobilizing communities around the country toward the same end. The population
  to be served by this demonstration program is youth experiencing homelessness, age
  24 and under, including unaccompanied youth and pregnant or parenting youth who
  are experiencing homelessness. HUD will award approximately $72,000,000 in YHDP
  under this NOFO through funding appropriated for fiscal year (FY) 2023 through the
  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Public Law 117-328) ("FY 2023 Appropriations
  Act). The FY 2023 Appropriations Act appropriated this funding to HUD "to implement
  projects to demonstrate how a comprehensive approach to serving homeless youth,
  age 24 and under ... can dramatically reduce youth homelessness.‚Äù
