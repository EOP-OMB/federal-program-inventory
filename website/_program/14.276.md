objective: "The Youth Homeless Demonstration Program covers includes three areas of\
  \ funding:\n\nYouth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP): Congress appropriates\
  \ these funds for communities to demonstrate how a comprehensive approach to serving\
  \ homeless youth, age 24 and under can dramatically reduce youth homelessness, which\
  \ HUD awards through a competitive process.  HUD awarded YHDP funds to 33 communities\
  \ in FY 2022 and anticipates awarding funds to 17 communities in FY 2023 and up\
  \ to 25 communities in FY 2024.\n\nYouth Homeless System Improvement Grants: Congress\
  \ appropriated $25 million in both FY 2023 and FY 2024 for grants to support communities\
  \ in establishing and implementing a response system for youth homelessness, or\
  \ for improving their existing system.  These grants can go to current, future,\
  \ or past YHDP communities as well as other eligible recipients.  \n\nTechnical\
  \ Assistance (TA): HUD awards approximately $10 million in TA funds, through a competitive\
  \ process, to firms that assist communities on improving system responses to youth\
  \ homelessness, and collection, analysis, use, and reporting of data and performance\
  \ measures under the comprehensive approaches to serve homeless youth."
