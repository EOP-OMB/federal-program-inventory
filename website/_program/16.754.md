objective: "Goals: \nTo enhance the capacity of regulatory and law enforcement agencies\
  \ to collect and analyze controlled substance prescription data through a centralized\
  \ database administered by an authorized state agency and federally recognized Indian\
  \ tribal governments.\n\nObjectives:\n•Implement and enhance prescription drug monitoring\
  \ programs. \n• Develop and enhance public safety, behavioral health, and public\
  \ health information sharing partnerships that leverage key public health and public\
  \ safety data sets (e.g., identified PDMP data, naloxone administrations, fatal\
  \ and non-fatal overdose data, drug arrests) and develop interventions based on\
  \ this information.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Percent of grantees with a registered\
  \ prescriber rate above 65% in their state PDMPs.\n\nPerformance Measure 2: Did\
  \ you develop any data-sharing agreements during the reporting period? \n\nPerformance\
  \ Measure 3: Did you identify any hotspots as a result of any analyses done during\
  \ the reporting period?"

    •  All but 8 states and territories require that prescribers or dispensers query

    \ some instances, data sharing may be limited to a couple of neighboring states.\
    \ In other instances, data sharing may span states within a specific region. \
    \  \n•\tAs of October 2018, 19 states have mandatory use requirements for prescribers\

- description: "PDMPs continue to evolve into one of the most efficient and effective\
    \ tools in the battle to reduce prescription drug misuse and diversion. PDMPs\
    \ are continuously improving and being more responsive to stakeholders with more\
    \ relevant, timely, and accurate information. PDMPs are widely recognized as an\
    \ important tool in addressing the drug abuse epidemic. PDMP systems maintain\
    \ a variety of information. The data collected by all the PDMPs is very similar\
    \ across the country, with some PDMPs having additional information. Every PDMP\
    \ receives data on a controlled substance prescription. While there is some variation,\
    \ most PDMPs track schedules two through five. Some PDMPs are now tracking information\
    \ from all prescriptions, not just controlled substance medications. In addition,\
    \ most PDMPs have the authority to track drugs of concern. Drugs of concern are\
    \ medications that are not controlled substances, but the state, territory, district,\
    \ or commonwealth has determined that these medications are being misused or abused.\
    \ Designating a drug of concern is typically accomplished through the promulgation\
    \ of administrative rules. Examples include gabapentin or butalbital. Additional\
    \ data fields that may be tracked include the source of payment for the prescription;\
    \ cash, commercial insurance, Medicare, Medicaid. Some PDMPs are collecting the\
    \ international classification of diseases, or ICD 10 codes. It’s code to identify\
    \ a disease or diagnosis.  \n\nIn addition to being a tool for health care providers,\
    \ PDMPs are also used as a resource for law enforcement when investigating prescription\
    \ drug-related crimes. Depending on the PDMP, law enforcement must either have\
    \ an official document such as a court order, search warrant, or subpoena or show\
    \ proof of an active investigation or probable cause. Although the prescription\
    \ data alone has proven to be extremely useful for health care providers, many\
    \ PDMPs perform different data types of analytics to help summarize and inform\
    \ the provider about their patient’s prescription history. The PDMP data fields\
    \ can easily be analyzed based on geographic location, types of medications dispensed,\
    \ medication combinations, overdose risk, and indicators of suspicious activity.\
    \ The analytics are graphically displayed on a PDMP report."
