- description: In 2022, the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP)
    managed 35 FY22 Congressional Special Interest programs. The CDMRP also provided
    program and award management support to other core Department of Defense (DOD)
    medical research programs. The CDRMP invests in groundbreaking research across
    the full spectrum of research and development, including basic, translational,
    and clinical research. By strategically funding high-risk, high-reward research
    projects that other agencies may not be willing to fund, the CDMRP addresses critical
    research gaps. CDMRP funded research benefits not only military members, military
    retirees, and family members, but the civilian population as well. The CDMRP underwent
    a comprehensive review by the Comptroller General, as directed in the FY21 Defense
    Appropriations Act (HR 133). The Government Accountability Office favorably assessed
    the CDMRP and provided entirely positive findings, listing no deficiencies and
    providing no recommendations for change.
