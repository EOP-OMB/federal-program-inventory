- description: 'The Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) is
    a global funding organization that fosters novel approaches to biomedical research
    in response to the expressed needs of its stakeholders–the American public, the
    military, and Congress. CDMRP originated in 1992 when Congress first appropriated
    funds to the Department of Defense (DOD), specifically for breast cancer research.  Since
    that time, Congress has added additional research programs and topics. CDMRP now
    manages individual research programs focused on military medical research, cancer
    research, and other disease-, disorder-, and injury-specific research. All the
    programs managed by CDMRP share the common goal of advancing paradigm-shifting
    research, solutions that will lead to cures or improvements in patient care, or
    breakthrough technologies and resources for clinical benefit. CDMRP strives to
    transform healthcare for Service members and the American public by funding innovative
    and impactful research. CDMRP oversees the investment of congressionally directed
    dollars to fund groundbreaking, high-impact, high-risk, high-reward, meritorious
    research that targets critical research gaps. CDMRP also provides management support
    of intramural and extramural military medical research.


    CDMRP is located under the US Army Futures Command and within US Army Medical
    Research and Development Command (USAMRDC). Since it first originated in fiscal
    year 1992 (FY92), CDMRP has been responsible for managing more than $15.94 billion
    (B) in funding targeted for congressionally directed research areas/topics.'

- description: In 2022, the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP)
    managed 35 FY22 Congressional Special Interest programs. The CDMRP also provided
    program and award management support to other core Department of Defense (DOD)
    medical research programs. The CDRMP invests in groundbreaking research across
    the full spectrum of research and development, including basic, translational,
    and clinical research. By strategically funding high-risk, high-reward research
    projects that other agencies may not be willing to fund, the CDMRP addresses critical
    research gaps. CDMRP funded research benefits not only military members, military
    retirees, and family members, but the civilian population as well. The CDMRP underwent
    a comprehensive review by the Comptroller General, as directed in the FY21 Defense
    Appropriations Act (HR 133). The Government Accountability Office favorably assessed
    the CDMRP and provided entirely positive findings, listing no deficiencies and
    providing no recommendations for change.
