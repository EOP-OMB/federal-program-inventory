objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. Also, the baseline tax
  system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures and generally would
  tax investment earnings. In contrast, individual contributions to Archer Medical
  Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are allowed as
  a deduction in determining adjusted gross income whether or not the individual itemizes
  deductions. Employer contributions to Archer MSAs and HSAs are excluded from income
  and employment taxes. Archer MSAs and HSAs require that the individual have coverage
  by a qualifying high deductible health plan. Earnings from the accounts are excluded
  from taxable income. Distributions from the accounts used for medical expenses are
  not taxable. The rules for HSAs are generally more flexible than for Archer MSAs
  and the deductible contribution amounts are greater (in 2024, $4,150 for taxpayers
  with individual coverage and $8,300 for taxpayers with family coverage). Thus, HSAs
  have largely replaced MSAs.
