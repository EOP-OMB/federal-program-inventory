objective: The Department of Energy (DOE) promotes nuclear energy as a resource capable
  of meeting the nation's energy, environmental, and national security needs by resolving
  technical, cost, safety, security, and proliferation resistance through research,
  development and demonstration at our national laboratories, universities and colleges,
  and U.S. industry. Our financial assistance programs play a key role in helping
  the DOE accomplish its mission of leading the nation's investment in the development
  and exploration of advanced nuclear technology and its underlying sciences. With
  this financial assistance, DOE strives to stimulate nuclear science and engineering
  education through support of advanced research and by training the next generation
  nuclear energy workforce, while seeking to align the nuclear energy research being
  conducted at U.S. colleges and universities with DOEâ€™s mission and goals.

- description: "DOE awarded more than $24 million through the Nuclear Energy University\
    \ Program (NEUP) to support 37 university-led nuclear energy research and development\
    \ projects in approximately 22 states. Additionally, 18 university-led projects\
    \ received more than $5.2 million for research reactor and infrastructure improvements.\
    \ 7 universities received almost $25 million for integrated research projects.\
    \ DOE selected 2 universities, 1 national laboratory, and 1 industry-led projects\
    \ that will take advantage of NSUF capabilities. DOE will support 2 of these projects\
    \ with a total just over $1.5 million in research funds. All 4 of these projects\
    \ will be supported by just over $2 million in facility access costs and expertise\
    \ for experimental neutron and ion irradiation testing, post-irradiation examination\
    \ facilities, synchrotron beamline capabilities, and technical assistance for\
    \ design and analysis of experiments through NSUF. DOE also selected 5 universities\
    \ for distinguished early career program to receive more than $3 million to support\
    \ high potential early career faculty. Through the Integrated University Program\
    \ (IUP), the DOE awarded more than $5 million for 65 undergraduate scholarships\
    \ and 28 graduate fellowships to students pursuing nuclear energy-related disciplines\
    \ at universities across the country. With this year's awards, the Office of Nuclear\
    \ Energy has now awarded more than $870 million to continue American leadership\
    \ in clean energy innovation and to train the next generation of nuclear engineers\
    \ and scientists through its university programs since 2009. \n\nVisit Energy.gov\
    \ for information on all of DOE's efforts to continue American leadership in low-carbon\
    \ nuclear energy innovation."
