objective: "The Department of Energy (DOE) promotes nuclear energy as a resource capable\
  \ of meeting the nation's energy, environmental, and national security needs by\
  \ resolving technical, cost, safety, security, and proliferation resistance through\
  \ research, development and demonstration at our national laboratories, universities\
  \ and colleges, and U.S. industry.  Our financial assistance programs play a key\
  \ role in helping the DOE accomplish its mission of leading the nation's investment\
  \ in the development and exploration of advanced nuclear technology and its underlying\
  \ sciences.   With this financial assistance, DOE strives to stimulate nuclear science\
  \ and engineering education through support of advanced research and by training\
  \ the next generation nuclear energy workforce, while seeking to align the nuclear\
  \ energy research being conducted at U.S. colleges and universities with DOE\u2019\
  s mission and goals."
