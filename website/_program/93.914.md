objective: To provide direct financial assistance to Eligible Metropolitan Areas (EMAs)
  and Transitional Grant Areas (TGAs) that have been the most severely affected by
  the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic to enhance access to a comprehensive,
  effective and cost efficient continuum of high quality, community-based care for
  low-income individuals and families with HIV and to strengthen strategies to reach
  minority populations. A comprehensive continuum of care includes the 13 core medical
  services specified in legislation and appropriate support services that assist people
  with HIV in accessing treatment for HIV/AIDS that is consistent with the Department
  of Health and Human Service (HHS) Treatment Guidelines. Comprehensive HIV/AIDS care
  beyond these core medical services may include support services that meet the criteria
  of enabling individuals and families with HIV to access and remain in primary medical
  care to improve their medical outcomes.
