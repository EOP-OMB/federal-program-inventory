objective: To provide direct financial assistance to Eligible Metropolitan Areas (EMAs)
  and Transitional Grant Areas (TGAs) that have been the most severely affected by
  the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic to enhance access to a comprehensive,
  effective and cost efficient continuum of high quality, community-based care for
  low-income individuals and families with HIV and to strengthen strategies to reach
  minority populations. A comprehensive continuum of care includes the 13 core medical
  services specified in legislation and appropriate support services that assist people
  with HIV in accessing treatment for HIV/AIDS that is consistent with the Department
  of Health and Human Service (HHS) Treatment Guidelines. Comprehensive HIV/AIDS care
  beyond these core medical services may include support services that meet the criteria
  of enabling individuals and families with HIV to access and remain in primary medical
  care to improve their medical outcomes.

popular_name: Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part A Emergency Relief for Areas
  with Substantial Need for Services
program_type: assistance_listing
results:
- description: "Nearly 68 percent of all clients served by the RWHAP in 2014 were\
    \ served in one of the 52 metropolitan areas funded under the RWHAP Part A.  Approximately\
    \ 73 percent of all people living with diagnosed HIV reside in a RWHAP Part A\
    \ EMA or TGA.  Part A funded sites provided 3.7 million core medical service visits\
    \ for health-related care utilizing a combination of Parts A, B, C, and D funding.\
    \  The number of visits for health-related services demonstrates the scope of\
    \ Part A in delivering primary care and related services for PLWH by increasing\
    \ the availability and accessibility of care.  From 2010 to 2015, HIV viral suppression\
    \ among RWHAP patients has increased from 70 percent to 83 percent, and racial/ethnic,\
    \ age-based, and regional disparities have decreased.  These improved outcomes\
    \ mean more PLWH in the U.S. will live near normal lifespans and have a reduced\
    \ risk of transmitting HIV to others.  \r\n\r\nRWHAP Part A jurisdictions are\
    \ experienced in data-driven, community-based needs assessment, responsive procurement\
    \ of a variety of direct medical and supportive services, working with a set of\
    \ providers to weave together a constellation of services, serving diverse populations\
    \ and continuing to make improvements that positively affect the HIV care continuum.\
    \  Thus, the RWHAP Part A has a significant public health impact on HIV incidence.\
    \ \r\n"
  year: '2016'
- description: According to the 2019 RWHAP Services Report, RWHAP recipients and subrecipients
    in cities that receive Part A funding provided health care and support services
    for 371,667 clients (this includes services provided by Part A recipients and
    subrecipients who receive RWHAP Parts A, B, C and/or D funding). 87.3 percent
    of RWHAP clients living in Part A jurisdictions, with available data on viral
    load, achieved viral suppression in 2019. Viral suppression was based on data
    for people with HIV who had at least one outpatient ambulatory health service
    visit and at least one viral load test during the measurement year. Viral suppression
    was defined as the most recent reported HIV RNA test result of <200 copies/mL.
  year: '2020'
- description: RWHAP recipients and subrecipients in cities that receive Part A funding
    provided health care and support services for 333,683  clients (this includes
    services provided by Part A recipients and subrecipients who receive RWHAP Parts
    A, B, C and/or D funding). 88.6 percent of RWHAP clients living in Part A jurisdictions,
    with available data on viral load, achieved viral suppression in 2020
  year: '2021'
- description: According to the FY 2021 RWHAP Services Report, RWHAP recipients and
    subrecipients in cities that receive Part A funding provided health care and support
    services for 337,270 clients (this includes services provided by Part A recipients
    and subrecipients who receive RWHAP Parts A, B, C and/or D funding). Nearly 90%
    of outpatient ambulatory health services (OAHS) clients receiving services from
    RWHAP Part A-funded providers reached viral suppression in 2021.
