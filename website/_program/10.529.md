objective: 'The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) administers 15 Federal nutrition
  assistance programs of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The
  mission of FNS is to reduce hunger and food insecurity in partnership with cooperating
  organizations by providing children and needy people access to food, a healthful
  diet, and nutrition education in a manner that supports American agriculture and
  inspires public confidence.


  The goal for this project is to develop and deliver a pilot nutrition paraprofessional
  training project for FDPIR staff working at local program sites. The training tools
  and resources developed under this grant should support the efforts of FDPIR local
  staff in conducting nutrition education activities for FDPIR participants who receive
  USDA foods.'
