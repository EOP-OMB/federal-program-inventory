objective: "NCATS' mission is to turn research observations into health solutions\
  \ through translational science. We work to develop or enhance the development,\
  \ testing, and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics for a wide range of\
  \ diseases and conditions. Key approaches include understanding what’s similar across\
  \ diseases to spur multiple treatments at a time, developing models that better\
  \ predict a person’s reaction to treatment, enhancing clinical trials so results\
  \ more accurately reflect the patient population, and leveraging real-world data\
  \ and data science approaches to address public health needs. Facilitating these\
  \ approaches are our robust partnerships with other government agencies, including\
  \ other NIH institutes, centers, and offices; industry; academia; nonprofit organizations;\
  \ and patients, patient advocates, and other communities.  \nNCATS' vision is to\
  \ bring more treatments for all people more quickly."
