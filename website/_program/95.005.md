objective: The Administration supports a combined public health and public safety
  approach to reducing drug use and its consequences. The National Drug Control Strategy
  recognizes that for individuals who come into contact with the justice system, substance
  use disorders must be identified and treated as early in the justice process as
  possible, and no one should be incarcerated for a non-violent drug offense alone.  Drug
  courts and other evidence-based diversion programs are key to the success of this
  approach.  The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) will award one or
  more cooperative agreements to establish training, technical assistance, and other
  resources to advance criminal justice reforms, including drug courts that respond
  to the needs of justice-involved individuals with substance use disorders.
