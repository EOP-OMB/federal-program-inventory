objective: 'The overall goal of the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) grant is to facilitate
  collaboration among the OTC jurisdictions, notably the State Environmental Commissioners/Secretaries,
  State Air Directors and their staff, to assist them in reducing ozone precursor
  emissions in their states and in representing their ozone related issues to the
  EPA. The focus of the OTC is to ensure real results in air quality improvement in
  the Ozone Transport Region. The OTC brings together the State members to coordinate
  reductions in air pollution to benefit the entire region. The Ozone Transport Commission
  (OTC or the Commission) is the single regional multi-state organization created
  under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) responsible for advising EPA on
  ground-level ozone and its precursor pollutant transport issues. The Commission
  is responsible for developing and implementing regional solutions to the ground-level
  ozone problem in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States. As directed under the CAA,
  EPA awards grants to the Commission under the authority of Section 106 of the CAA.
  Section 184 of the CAA established the Ozone Transport Region (OTR) that, by law,
  develops and recommends regional strategies for cleaning up air pollution.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: The OTC’s work continues to help states develop
  state implementation plans through collaboration on coordinated state-level controls,
  as appropriate, that will reduce the formation and transport of ozone into and within
  the Ozone transport Region (OTR). Key ozone reduction strategies being pursued or
  under consideration by OTC members include transportation and building electrification,
  and low- and zero-emission electricity generation. These efforts will reduce ozone
  precursor pollution while also having co-benefits in reducing greenhouse gas emissions
  from the burning of fossil fuels as well as reducing pollutants that disproportionately
  impact disadvantaged communities.'

- description: 'The Stationary and Area Source (SAS) Committee and the Mobile Source
    Committee (MSC) continued to develop draft model rules for regional ozone control
    measures. During this quarter, the SAS Committee workgroups worked on addressing
    the charges given by the Commission at the 2017 Fall Meeting. The main charge
    required the Committee to perform technical analyses to calculate & document emissions
    reductions and develop cost estimates for the three SAS strategies formalized
    in the Good Neighbor State Implementation Plan (GN SIP) Resolution. The emissions
    reductions from these strategies which cover sources inside & outside of the OTR
    will be used in photochemical modeling to help OTC states include these measures
    in their GN SIPs. The Largest Contributors Workgroup worked on two of these strategies,
    i.e. calculating emissions reductions from and costs of: 1. optimizing the use
    of existing SCR or SNCR NOx control technology on coal-fired EGUs each day of
    ozone season, and 2. installing SCR or SNCR control technology on uncontrolled
    coal-fired EGUs & optimize use of such technology each day of the ozone season.
    Results of photochemical modeling (which is currently underway) and cost estimates
    (which are ready) will be presented to the Commission in the June meeting. The
    Control Measures Workgroup is working on the 3rd strategy which deals with calculating
    the emissions reductions gained from adopting the “OTC Model Rule for Control
    of NOx Emissions From Natural Gas Pipeline Compressor Fuel-Fired Prime Movers”
    in GN SIPs. This work is ongoing and the results are expected before the June
    meeting. In addressing the standing SAS charge requiring periodic updates of the
    OTC Model Rule on Consumer Products, the Consumer Products Workgroup revised and
    updated the current (Phase IV) Consumer Products Model Rule based on California
    standards. The new Phase V Model Rule includes several new categories, excludes
    a few, requires more stringent VOC limits for existing categories, has revised
    definition language, and an optional 3 year sell through limit for existing products
    that do not comply with VOC limits. The new Model Rule has been posted on the
    OTC website for public comment with a deadline of May 11, 2018. The Mobile Source
    Committee (MSC) began its work fulfilling the charge given to it at 2017 Fall
    Meeting. The MSC continued to follow developments with policies affecting aftermarket
    catalytic converters including having conversations with EPA including Regions
    1, 2 and 3 in response to the resolution adopted by the Committee at the Spring
    Meeting. The MSC finished work on recommendations on policies to reduce vehicle
    idling regionally and continued work on an idling educational toolkit. The MSC
    completed collection of survey data concerning state progress in implementing
    several programs and initiatives. Finally, the MSC developed preliminary estimates
    of emission reductions that could be achieved both inside and outside the OTR.
    Both the SAS and MSC are working with a broad range of industry and other stakeholders,
    states and regional organizations both within and outside the OTR, and EPA offices
    to develop a framework for control measurement programs based on OTC Model Rules
    which are significant not only to eastern region but have national applicability
    in addressing the sources contributing to ozone formation and transport. In addition,
    on January 5, 2018 the OTC submitted its comments on EPA’s “Proposed Rule on the
    Repeal of Emission Requirements for Glider Vehicles, Glider Engines, and Glider
    Kits”. OTC opposes the adoption of this Proposed Rule as it could potentially
    result in an increase in air pollution with adverse public health impacts. OTC
    continued its efforts in coordinating with EPA to discuss state implementation
    plan development and related issues. Discussions with non-OTR states included
    the progress of ERTAC (the Eastern Regional Technical Advisory Committee) focused
    on developing a model for electricity generation and emissions from EGUs, a tool
    that incorporates state collected data and information on EGUs, and how to coordinate
    with other Regional Planning Organizations (RPOs) on modeling work and the need
    for federal measures to enable some OTC states attain the 2008 and the 2015 Ozone
    NAAQS standards. The OTC also participated in the Federal/RPOs technical collaborative
    including participating in a workgroup that developed broad recommendations for
    the next base-year to use in modeling platforms. OTC is participating and providing
    leadership in a multi-regional and EPA collaborative approach to develop emissions
    inventories and the next photochemical modeling platform. The OTC and other states
    continue to rely on the 2011 modeling platform for making projections, particularly
    with control measures applied. The OTC Modeling Committee and staff provide critical
    work to ensure the region’s technical analysis and decision-making are using the
    best modeling available.


    The OTC has completed several project milestones which resulted in the following
    policy products (now available on OTC website at https://otcair.org/document.asp?Fview=Report):
    1) Finalized and published a “Regulatory and Technical Guideline for Control of
    Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Emissions from Natural Gas Pipeline Compressor Fuel-Fired
    Prime Movers”, and the accompanying “Technical Support Documentation” for “Analysis
    of Technical Feasibility & Cost Effectiveness”, May 23, 2019. 2) Finalized and
    published an “Analysis of the Potential Health Impacts of Reducing Ozone Levels
    in the OTR Using BenMAP – 2018 Edition” February 2, 2019.  3) Finalized and published
    a “Regulatory & Technical Guideline for Consumer Products Phase V” and the accompanying
    “Technical Support Documentation” for emissions reductions and cost analyses,
    11/20/2018.  4) Finalized and published a “2011-Based Modeling Platform Support
    Document” October 18, 2018.'
