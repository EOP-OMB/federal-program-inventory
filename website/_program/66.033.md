objective: "The overall goal of the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) grant is to facilitate\
  \ collaboration among the OTC jurisdictions, notably the State Environmental Commissioners/Secretaries,\
  \ State Air Directors and their staff, to assist them in reducing ozone precursor\
  \ emissions in their states and in representing their ozone related issues to the\
  \ EPA. The focus of the OTC is to ensure real results in air quality improvement\
  \ in the Ozone Transport Region. The OTC brings together the State members to coordinate\
  \ reductions in air pollution to benefit the entire region. The Ozone Transport\
  \ Commission (OTC or the Commission) is the single regional multi-state organization\
  \ created under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) responsible for advising\
  \ EPA on ground-level ozone and its precursor pollutant transport issues. The Commission\
  \ is responsible for developing and implementing regional solutions to the ground-level\
  \ ozone problem in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States. As directed under the\
  \ CAA, EPA awards grants to the Commission under the authority of Section 106 of\
  \ the CAA. Section 184 of the CAA established the Ozone Transport Region (OTR) that,\
  \ by law, develops and recommends regional strategies for cleaning up air pollution.\n\
  \nFunding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: The OTC\u2019s work continues to help states\
  \ develop state implementation plans through collaboration on coordinated state-level\
  \ controls, as appropriate, that will reduce the formation and transport of ozone\
  \ into and within the Ozone transport Region (OTR). Key ozone reduction strategies\
  \ being pursued or under consideration by OTC members include transportation and\
  \ building electrification, and low- and zero-emission electricity generation. These\
  \ efforts will reduce ozone precursor pollution while also having co-benefits in\
  \ reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as well as\
  \ reducing pollutants that disproportionately impact disadvantaged communities."
