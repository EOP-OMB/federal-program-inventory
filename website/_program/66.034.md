objective: 'The objectives of this assistance listing are to fund surveys, research,
  investigations, demonstrations, and special purpose activities related to the causes,
  effects (including health and welfare effects), extent, prevention, and control
  of air pollution. This listing funds a variety of activities authorized by Section
  103 of the Clean Air Act.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: (1) Global Green Freight Supply Chain Demonstration
  program provides technical support, management and oversight in implementing outreach,
  analysis and capacity building for international green freight programs. (2) National
  Air Toxics Trends Station (NATTS) Monitoring. Funds for the NATTS support network
  operation and maintenance as well as quality assurance, equipment and sample shipping
  and handling, and data handling. (3) Fine Particle (PM2.5) Monitoring. The PM2.5
  monitoring network is used for comparison to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
  (NAAQS) public reporting of the Air Quality Index; and to characterize the chemical
  composition that makes up fine particulate matter. (4) Indoor Air Quality (IAQ).
  State and local asthma program capacity building to secure sustainable financing
  for home-based environmental interventions for low income and minority communities;
  education and outreach to the public, and technical assistance to states and tribes,
  to foster radon testing and mitigation in homes and schools; technical support to
  state IAQ programs, and communities, to foster adoption and spread of IAQ risk reduction
  policies and programs for residential and commercial (schools) buildings, with a
  focus on low income communities; support to the household energy sector to promote
  the adoption of clean cooking and heating technologies and implementation of cookstove
  design and performance standards.'

- description: "Approximately 90 air pollution control agencies received PM2.5 grants\
    \ to manage and operate the PM2.5 network across the country to ensure the public\
    \ has access to clean air by comparing data and implementation of the National\
    \ Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS); to provide the public with timely reports\
    \ and forecasts of the Air Quality Index, and to provide information to health\
    \ and atmospheric scientists to better inform future reviews of the NAAQS. \n\n\
    132 grants awarded to community-based organizations and air pollution control\
    \ agencies to enhance air quality monitoring in communities across the United\
    \ States with environmental and health outcome disparities stemming from pollution\
    \ and the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n126 supplemental grants awarded to air pollution\
    \ control agencies for enhanced ambient air monitoring.  \n\nIndoor air quality\
    \ funding for 7 grants to support radon reduction and capacity building, reduce\
    \ asthma disparities by improving indoor air quality in homes and schools, build\
    \ capacity to address indoor air quality risk in low-income communities."
