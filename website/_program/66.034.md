objective: 'The objectives of this assistance listing are to fund surveys, research,
  investigations, demonstrations, and special purpose activities related to the causes,
  effects (including health and welfare effects), extent, prevention, and control
  of air pollution. This listing funds a variety of activities authorized by Section
  103 of the Clean Air Act.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: (1) Global Green Freight Supply Chain Demonstration
  program provides technical support, management and oversight in implementing outreach,
  analysis and capacity building for international green freight programs. (2) National
  Air Toxics Trends Station (NATTS) Monitoring. Funds for the NATTS support network
  operation and maintenance as well as quality assurance, equipment and sample shipping
  and handling, and data handling. (3) Fine Particle (PM2.5) Monitoring. The PM2.5
  monitoring network is used for comparison to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
  (NAAQS) public reporting of the Air Quality Index; and to characterize the chemical
  composition that makes up fine particulate matter. (4) Indoor Air Quality (IAQ).
  State and local asthma program capacity building to secure sustainable financing
  for home-based environmental interventions for low income and minority communities;
  education and outreach to the public, and technical assistance to states and tribes,
  to foster radon testing and mitigation in homes and schools; technical support to
  state IAQ programs, and communities, to foster adoption and spread of IAQ risk reduction
  policies and programs for residential and commercial (schools) buildings, with a
  focus on low income communities; support to the household energy sector to promote
  the adoption of clean cooking and heating technologies and implementation of cookstove
  design and performance standards.'

- description: "Indoor Air/Radon: Produced effective outreach strategies to educate\
    \ key audiences about indoor air pollutants and their associated health risks,\
    \ convincing them to adopt effective mitigation and control strategies. These\
    \ outreach strategies focused on several critical aspects of indoor air quality\
    \ that pose significant risks to public health, and in particular, to children\
    \ and to other disproportionately impacted segments of society. These include:\
    \ reducing the exposure of children and others with asthma to indoor triggers\
    \ that worsen their condition; promoting the adoption of operation and maintenance\
    \ practices in schools throughout the nation to reduce the harmful effects of\
    \ poor indoor air quality on the health of students and staff; promoting voluntary\
    \ radon testing by homeowners to identify elevated levels and fix them when they\
    \ are found, as well as working with homebuilders to incorporate radon resistant\
    \ construction features into new homes; and encouraging adult smokers to protect\
    \ their children from the adverse health effects of environmental exposure to\
    \ secondhand smoke by making a conscious decision to smoke outside and keep their\
    \ homes and cars smokefree\r\n\r\n\r\nClimate Change Division: The USEPA's Global\
    \ Methane Initiative Grants program provides cooperative agreements to recipients\
    \ around the globe to build capacity and promote international capture and use\
    \ of methane. The grants have become an integral and important capacity building\
    \ instrument of the Global Methane Initiative, a public-private partnership (of\
    \ more than 33 partner governments) that reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution\
    \ by promoting the cost-effective, near-term recovery and use of methane, a GHG\
    \ that is more than 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Methane capture\
    \ and use projects supported by the partnership through grants and other means\
    \ are currently reducing emissions by more than 27.3 million metric tons of carbon\
    \ dioxide equivalent ~ annually equivalent to the annual emissions from 5 million\
    \ passenger vehicles. The USEPA's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reporting Grants program\
    \ will help facilities that participate in voluntary, state-based and federal\
    \ GHG reporting programs better understand the requirements of voluntary and state\
    \ GHG reporting programs in comparison to the federal rule; and identify options\
    \ for how data collected through state and federal reporting requirements may\
