objective: 'The purpose of this funding is to support agricultural and forestry extension
  activities at 1890 Land-Grant Institutions, including Tuskegee University, West
  Virginia State University, and Central State University.


  This grant assists diverse audiences, particularly those who have limited social
  and economic resources. Funding supports practical, research-based educational opportunities
  that respond to the changing needs of these clients, who are often families owning
  small to medium-size farms. The workshops and programs enhance the marketing skills
  of these farmers so they can place their products in local, national, and global
  markets. It also supports training for minority farmers and landowners to acquire
  adequate capital, adopt new technologies, and use estate planning and tax incentive
  programs to retain operations and increase profitability.'
