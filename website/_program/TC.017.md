objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain
  types or sources of income. Current law allows capital gains realized by individuals
  to be taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 20 percent (plus
  the 3.8 percent surtax). Certain sales of coal under royalty contracts qualify for
  taxation as capital gains rather than ordinary income.
