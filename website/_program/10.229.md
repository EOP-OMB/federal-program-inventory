objective: 'Funds are provided for support the Extension Collaborative on Immunization
  Teaching & Engagement (EXCITE). As of 15 March 2021, the United States has 29.5
  million confirmed Covid-19 cases, resulting in 534,000 deaths. The pandemic has
  led to disruptions in the food and agricultural supply chain, from field to production
  to distribution, and among the labor force in terms of lost wages, compromised health,
  and loss of life.

  New strains of the mutating virus are proving more readily transmissible and heightening
  concerns that vaccination efficacy could be negatively impacted. The vaccine rollout
  has been hampered by logistical and jurisdictional concerns, leading to confusion
  among the general population about how, when, where, and why to receive the vaccination.

  To help promote vaccine confidence and uptake, the Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture have entered
  into an Interagency Agreement to engage Land-grant Universities (LGUs) and the Cooperative
  Extension System (CES) to improve vaccination coverage in rural and other medically
  underserved communities.

  The eXtension Foundation, working collaboratively with the Extension Committee on
  Organization and Policy at the Association of Public and Land-grant Colleges and
  Universities, has the infrastructure and capacity to respond expeditiously and effectively
  to help address this public health emergency.'
