objective: "The National Environmental Information Exchange Network (EN) is an inter-governmental\
  \ partnership to foster better environmental management and decision-making through\
  \ increased access to timely and high-quality environmental information. The EN,\
  \ launched in 2002, uses a standards-based approach to facilitate environmental\
  \ data sharing among EPA, states, tribes and territories. This framework allows\
  \ organizations to exchange and share data over the Internet regardless of the specific\
  \ information technology used. Its goals include expanding access to environmental\
  \ data, personalizing the access experience through customized portals and re-engineering\
  \ and streamlining regulatory information collection and reporting processes to\
  \ achieve burden reduction and cost avoidance. The Exchange Network Grant Program\
  \ provides funding for projects that develop the Network and enable timely, on-demand\
  \ access to environmental data through innovative technologies, improved support\
  \ systems, and expanded collaboration using shared tools and services.  \n\nThere\
  \ are three funding areas for the FY 2025 EPA Exchange Network Grant Program:  \n\
  \nFunding Area 1: Increased Data Access and Innovative Business Processes. The opportunities\
  \ under this funding area are designed to help agencies adopt innovative business\
  \ processes and modernize the critical data services that power their systems and\
  \ workflows.  \n\nFunding Area 2: Eliminate paper submittals and expand e-reporting.\
  \ The opportunities under this funding area are designed by EPA National Program\
  \ Offices to help their stakeholders submit and share programmatic data for fourteen\
  \ EPA programs.  \n\nFunding Area 3: Augment the Information Management Capacity\
  \ of EN Partners. The opportunities under this funding area are designed to enable\
  \ applicants to build the IT and data management capacity necessary to effectively\
  \ manage their environmental programs and to identify the most valuable ways for\
  \ their programs to participate in the EN."
