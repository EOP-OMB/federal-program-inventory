objective: 'The National Environmental Information Exchange Network (EN) is an inter-governmental
  partnership to foster better environmental management and decision-making through
  increased access to timely and high quality environmental information. The EN, launched
  in 2002, uses a standards-based approach to facilitate environmental data sharing
  among EPA, states, tribes and territories. This framework allows organizations to
  exchange and share data over the Internet regardless of the specific information
  technology used. Its goals include expanding access to environmental data, personalizing
  the access experience through customized portals and re-engineering and streamlining
  regulatory information collection and reporting processes to achieve burden reduction
  and cost avoidance. The Exchange Network Grant Program provides funding for projects
  that develop the Network and enable timely, on-demand access to environmental data
  through innovative technologies, improved support systems, and expanded collaboration
  using shared tools and services. There are three funding areas for the FY 2023 EPA
  Exchange Network Grant Program: Funding Area 1: Increased Data Access and Innovative
  Business Processes. The opportunities under this funding area are designed to help
  agencies adopt innovative business processes and modernize the critical data services
  that power their systems and workflows. Funding Area 2: Eliminate paper submittals
  and expand e-reporting. The opportunities under this funding area are designed by
  EPA National Program Offices to help their stakeholders submit and share programmatic
  data for fourteen EPA programs. Funding Area 3: Augment the Information Management
  Capacity of EN Partners. The opportunities under this funding area are designed
  to enable applicants to build the IT and data management capacity necessary to effectively
  manage their environmental programs and to identify the most valuable ways for their
  programs to participate in the EN.'
