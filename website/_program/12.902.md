objective: The DoD Cyber Service Academy; formerly the DoD Cyber Scholarship Program
  was established in accordance with provisions of Chapter 112, "Cyber Scholarship
  Program," of title 10, United States Code, added by Public Law 106-398, The National
  Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2001. The purpose of the program is to
  recruitment and retain qualified cyber talent within the Department of Defense by
  offering scholarships to students in exchange for a period of obligated service
  upon graduation. National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C))
  may nominate current undergraduate or graduate students who are pursuing a cyber-related
  degree for scholarship consideration. Current DoD Components/Agencies may nominate
  their permanent civilians or active-duty military members to pursue a cyber-related
  degree at one of the partnering CAEs. CAEs may also apply for modest support for
  building the institution's capacity for research and education in cybersecurity.
