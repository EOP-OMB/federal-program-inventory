objective: The John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC) supports research and research
  training to reduce disparities in global health and to foster partnerships between
  U.S. scientists and their counterparts abroad. FIC supports basic biological, behavioral,
  and social science research, as well as related research training and career development.
  The research portfolio is divided into several programs that support a wide variety
  of funding mechanisms to meet programmatic objectives.

- description: "Fogarty started a new career development program for low- and middle-income\
    \ country (LMIC) scientists and issued its first grants this year. While FIC has\
    \ a similar program for U.S. scientists, this is the first of its kind at NIH\
    \ that is specifically for foreign investigators. The Emerging Global Leader Award\
    \ provides research support and protected time to research scientists from low-\
    \ and middle-income countries (LMICs) who hold an academic junior faculty position\
    \ or research scientist appointment at an LMIC academic or research institution.\
    \  The awards span a wide breadth of health disciplines and the proposed research\
    \ projects are highly relevant to the health priorities of the LMIC scientistsâ€™\
    \ home countries.\r\n\r\nExamples of two additional new programs launched this\
    \ year include the Global Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) and Injury Across the\
    \ Lifespan: Exploratory Research Program (R21) and the Emerging Epidemic Virus\
    \ Research Training for West African Countries with Widespread Transmission of\
    \ Ebola (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) Planning Grant (D71). The NCD and\
    \ Injury Research Program supports exploratory research on locally relevant non-communicable\
    \ diseases (NCDs) or injury in LMICs. The Emerging Epidemic Virus Research Training\
    \ Planning grant encourages collaborative applications from either U.S. or African\
    \ research institution partners to plan research training and capacity building\
    \ programs focused on emerging viral epidemics in these three countries. Awards\
    \ for both programs will be made in FY2016 with additional competition cycle in\
    \ FY2017.\r\n FY16 $50,563,458\r\nFY17 $51,397,157\r\nFY18 $52,168,108"

- description: 'Fiscal Year 2017: FIC made six awards for the Fogarty Global Health
    Training Program (D43), with NIH partners at NIMH, NINDS, ORWH, and NHLBI. Built
    upon the successes of the historic Global Health Program for Fellows and Scholars,
    this new program provides opportunities for pre-doctoral/pre-professional degree
    students and post-doctoral/post-professional degree students from the U.S. and
    LMICs to spend a year of mentored research at an established research site in
    an LMIC. The FY17 class has 86 trainees with expertise covering a range of medical,
    nursing, and veterinary disciplines.

    Fogarty, with partners in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Office of
    Behavioral Social Science Research (OBSSR), also made new awards in its International
    Tobacco: Health Research and Capacity Building program (R01).  This program supports
    trans-disciplinary research on the international tobacco epidemic and focuses
    on reducing the burden of morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco use in LMICs.'

  grant program legislation, terms and conditions cited in the Notice of Grant Award;
  the restrictions on the expenditure of Federal funds in appropriations acts, to
