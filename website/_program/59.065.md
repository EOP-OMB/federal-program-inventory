objective: "Growth Accelerators provide focused assistance to STEM/R&D entrepreneurs\
  \ to start and scale their businesses. Typically run by experienced entrepreneurs,\
  \ accelerators help small businesses access seed capital, mentors, counseling, overhead\
  \ services and networking opportunities. These organizations help accelerate a startup\
  \ company\u2019s path towards success with targeted advice on revenue growth, job\
  \ growth and sourcing outside funding. Accelerators also help foster an inclusive\
  \ entrepreneurial ecosystem by stimulating entrepreneurship outside of traditional\
  \ startup hubs. Applicants in the 2021 Competition focused their proposed efforts\
  \ on one of the following groups: women entrepreneurs, minority entrepreneurs, or\
  \ other target entrepreneurs identified by applicants (ie. rural, veterans, individuals\
  \ with disabilities, etc.)."
