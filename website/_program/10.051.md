objective: To improve and stabilize farm income, to assist in bringing about a better
  balance between supply and demand of the commodities, and to assist farmers in the
  orderly marketing of their crops. Marketing assistance loans provide producers interim
  financing at harvest time to meet cash flow needs without having to sell their commodities
  when market prices are typically at harvest-time lows. Allowing producers to store
  production at harvest facilitates more orderly marketing of commodities throughout
  the year. Market loan repayment provisions specify, under certain circumstances,
  that producers may repay loans at less than principal plus accrued interest and
  other charges. Alternatively, loan deficiency payment (LDP) provisions specify that,
  in lieu of securing a loan, producers may be eligible for an LDP. Both programs
  allow a producer flexibly to market commodities while providing cashflow.
