objective: "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides major economic and\
  \ energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers, states and the\
  \ American Indian community. The BOEM oversees the exploration and development of\
  \ oil, natural gas and other minerals and renewable energy alternatives on the Nation\u2019\
  s outer continental shelf. BOEM continues to look for better ways to serve the American\
  \ people and to ensure that the Nation receives the best value for its resources\
  \ now and into the future. The program not only supports decisions made within the\
  \ Department of Interior, but also provides coastal States and local governments\
  \ with the information necessary to ensure that all stages of offshore energy and\
  \ mineral activities are conducted in a manner to protect both the human and natural\
  \ environments. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) Section 1346 mandates\
  \ the conduct of environmental and socioeconomic studies needed for the assessment\
  \ and management of environmental impacts on the human, marine, and coastal environments\
  \ which may be affected by oil and gas or other mineral development. OCSLA Section\
  \ 1345 authorizes the use of cooperative agreements with affected States to meet\
  \ the requirements of OCSLA, including sharing of information, joint utilization\
  \ of available expertise, formation of joint monitoring arrangements to carry out\
  \ applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and stipulations relevant to outer\
  \ continental shelf operations both onshore and offshore. The Delegations 218 DM\
  \ 1 authorized, except as provided in 200 Departmental Manual (DM) 1, to exercise\
  \ the program authority of the Assistant Secretary \u2013 Land and Minerals Management\
  \ with respect to leasing and authorizations for exploration, development, and production\
  \ of conventional and renewable energy resources and marine mineral resources on\
  \ the Continental Shelf, and all associated functions that relate thereto.  The\
  \ purpose of the Environmental Studies Program is to obtain the information needed\
  \ for the assessment and the management of environmental impacts; to predict impacts\
  \ on marine biota; and to monitor the human, marine, and coastal environments to\
  \ provide time series and data trend information."
