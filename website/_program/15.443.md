objective: "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides major economic and\
  \ energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers, states and the\
  \ American Indian community. The BOEM oversees the exploration and development of\
  \ oil, natural gas and other minerals and renewable energy alternatives on the Nation’s\
  \ outer continental shelf. BOEM continues to look for better ways to serve the American\
  \ people and to ensure that the Nation receives the best value for its resources\
  \ now and into the future. The purpose of the Environmental Studies Program is to\
  \ obtain the information needed for the assessment and the management of environmental\
  \ impacts; to predict impacts on marine biota; and to monitor the human, marine,\
  \ and coastal environments to provide time series and data trend information.\n\n\
  As part of the efforts of this program BOEM is to partner with organizations to\
  \ implement and administer a Training and Internship for Direct Employment (TIDE)\
  \ Program.\n \nThe partner will provide appropriate outreach and recruitment services\
  \ for resource assistant interns and provide ongoing program and administrative\
  \ support, such as paying stipends, coordinating travel and training logistics,\
  \ managing and updating each intern’s records, tracking progress and performance,\
  \ and providing reports as needed to meet program requirements.  BOEM will provide\
  \ internship opportunities, make intern selections, establish annual cohort schedules,\
  \ implement work planning procedures, and, in collaboration with the partner organization,\
  \ arrange for onboarding, orientation, and other training, as necessary."
