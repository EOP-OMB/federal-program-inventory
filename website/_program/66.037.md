objective: "To provide, Internships, Training, Workshops, and Technical Monitoring\
  \ in support of the Clean Air Act. These activities aim to: (1) support the development\
  \ of career-oriented personnel qualified to work in occupations involving environmental\
  \ protection and air pollution abatement and control; (2) provide technical training\
  \ for state, local, territorial, and Indian Tribal environmental control agencies;\
  \ (3) enhance the capability of state, tribal, and local agencies responsible for\
  \ environmental pollution control or other agencies with similar pollution control\
  \ responsibilities; (4) provide educational renewal for career oriented personnel\
  \ to achieve additional knowledge through academic professional training; (5) provide\
  \ students in science, engineering, and other relevant fields with education and\
  \ training opportunities to enhance their understanding of air quality-related topics;\
  \ and 6) to increase the quality and number of people into the environmental control\
  \ field. Projects should also focus on addressing environmental justice (EJ) concerns\
  \ in communities. EJ is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people\
  \ regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development,\
  \ implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.\
  \ \n\nFunding Priority - Fiscal Year 2025: (1) The Tribal Training Support for the\
  \ Community and Tribal Air Quality Programs grant supports EPA’s efforts to encourage\
  \ and facilitate involvement of tribal partner governments in implementing ambient\
  \ air quality programs under the Clean Air Act in Indian country, through the provision\
  \ of training and technical support. The training and technical support will promote\
  \ the capacity of tribes to successfully implement efficient and effective air quality\
  \ management programs. (2) The American Indian Air Quality Training Program provides\
  \ workshop training, internships and technical support to tribal governments to\
  \ investigate, develop and establish air quality management programs for lands under\
  \ their jurisdiction. The Tribal Air Monitoring Support Center is a component of\
  \ this program and provides a full spectrum of technical support to tribes undertaking\
  \ air quality monitoring and related activities. (3) The Student Program for Environmental\
  \ Excellence in Design (SPEED) program provides graduate-level students and senior-level\
  \ undergraduate opportunities to collaborate with EPA and increase their awareness\
  \ and understanding of the environmental benefits associated with increased fuel\
  \ efficiency, reduced carbon intensity in transportation fuels, and reduced emissions\
  \ in advanced vehicles."

    comprehensive air quality policy and regulatory analysis consisting of support
    and national coordination activities to assist tribes in understanding, participating
    in and responding to US EPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) policy and regulatory
    activities; provides opportunity for American Indian students, educators, and
    communities to participate in, and pursue environmental careers in the field of
    air quality management. The AIAQTP program also conducts outreach to local communities
    on air quality and related environmental justice issues via a website to disseminate
    the environmental education curriculum. The Student Program for Environmental
    Excellence in Design (SPEED) program provides graduate-level students and senior-level
    undergraduate students in the science, technology, and engineering disciplines
    opportunities to collaborate with the EPA and obtain research training on-site
    at the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Lab (NVFEL). Students increase

    The Tribal Training Support for the Community and Tribal Programs project supported
    17 tribes and approximately 100 tribal environmental staff and tribal community
    members in our very first set of tribal community trainings. The trainings brought
    together not only community members and EPA personnel but also tribal environmental
    professionals, industry, state and local organizations, colleges and other stakeholders
    surrounding the Navajo Nation. Understanding air quality issues within the community,
    learning about the regulatory development process, and being able to engage in
    the regulatory process in a meaningful way were just some of the accomplishments
    of these particular trainings.
