  \ in support of the Clean Air Act. These activities aim to: (1) support the development\
  \ of career-oriented personnel qualified to work in occupations involving environmental\
  \ protection and air pollution abatement and control; (2) provide technical training\
  \ for state, local, territorial, and Indian Tribal environmental control agencies;\
  \ (3) enhance the capability of state, tribal, and local agencies responsible for\
  \ environmental pollution control or other agencies with similar pollution control\
  \ responsibilities; (4) provide educational renewal for career oriented personnel\
  \ to achieve additional knowledge through academic professional training; (5) provide\
  \ students in science, engineering, and other relevant fields with education and\
  \ training opportunities to enhance their understanding of air quality-related topics;\
  \ and 6) to increase the quality and number of people into the environmental control\
  \ field. Projects should also focus on addressing environmental justice (EJ) concerns\
  \ in communities. EJ is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people\
  \ regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development,\
  \ implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.\

  \ encourage and facilitate involvement of tribal partner governments in implementing\
  \ ambient air quality programs under the Clean Air Act in Indian country, through\
  \ the provision of training and technical support. The training and technical support\
  \ will promote the capacity of tribes to successfully implement efficient and effective\
  \ air quality management programs. (2) The American Indian Air Quality Training\
  \ Program provides workshop training, internships and technical support to tribal\
  \ governments to investigate, develop and establish air quality management programs\
  \ for lands under their jurisdiction. The Tribal Air Monitoring Support Center is\
  \ a component of this program and provides a full spectrum of technical support\
  \ to tribes undertaking air quality monitoring and related activities. (3) The Student\
  \ Program for Environmental Excellence in Design (SPEED) program provides graduate-level\
  \ students and senior-level undergraduate opportunities to collaborate with EPA\
  \ and increase their awareness and understanding of the environmental benefits associated\
  \ with increased fuel efficiency, reduced carbon intensity in transportation fuels,\
  \ and reduced emissions in advanced vehicles."
