objective: The U.S. Government (USG) is providing resources to promote diplomatic
  solutions, through English language instruction and computer training, critical
  skills development and other public diplomacy programs. These resources support

  the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making
  almost everywhere in the world today.
