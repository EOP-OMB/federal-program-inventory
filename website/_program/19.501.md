objective: The U.S. Government (USG) is providing resources to promote diplomatic
  solutions, through English language instruction and computer training, critical
  skills development and other public diplomacy programs. These resources support
  the people, platforms, and programs necessary to meet the international challenges
  to American security and welfare. Educational and cultural engagement is premised
  on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future leaders, and
  the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making
  almost everywhere in the world today.
