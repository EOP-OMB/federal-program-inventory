objective: "Dental Reimbursement Program (DRP): To partially compensate accredited\
  \ dental schools, postdoctoral dental education programs, and dental hygiene education\
  \ programs for unreimbursed costs they have incurred in providing oral health services\
  \ to low income, uninsured, and underserved people with HIV. Reimbursement will\
  \ be made for documenting the number of low income people with HIV served and the\
  \ unreimbursed oral health costs incurred by each institution as compared with the\
  \ total number of low income people with HIV served and costs incurred by all eligible\
  \ applicants. The purpose of the DRP is to improve access to oral health care services\
  \ for low income, uninsured, and underserved people with HIV. Provide clinical training\
  \ for dental and dental hygiene students and dental residents to deliver oral health\
  \ care to people with HIV. \n\nCommunity Based Dental Partnership Program (CBDPP):\
  \ To improve access to oral health care services for low income, uninsured and underserved\
  \ people with HIV in underserved geographic areas, while simultaneously providing\
  \ education and clinical training for dental and dental hygiene students, dental\
  \ residents, or other dental providers in community-based settings. This is achieved\
  \ through multi-partner collaborations between dental and dental hygiene education\
  \ programs recognized by the Commission on Dental Accreditation and community-based\
  \ dental providers."
