objective: "Dental Reimbursement Program (DRP): To partially compensate accredited\
  \ dental schools, postdoctoral dental education programs, and dental hygiene education\
  \ programs for unreimbursed costs they have incurred in providing oral health services\
  \ to low income, uninsured, and underserved people with HIV. Reimbursement will\
  \ be made for documenting the number of low income people with HIV served and the\
  \ unreimbursed oral health costs incurred by each institution as compared with the\
  \ total number of low income people with HIV served and costs incurred by all eligible\
  \ applicants. The purpose of the DRP is to improve access to oral health care services\
  \ for low income, uninsured, and underserved people with HIV. Provide clinical training\
  \ for dental and dental hygiene students and dental residents to deliver oral health\
  \ care to people with HIV. \n\nCommunity Based Dental Partnership Program (CBDPP):\

  \ people with HIV in underserved geographic areas, while simultaneously providing\
  \ education and clinical training for dental and dental hygiene students, dental\
