  \ dental schools, postdoctoral dental education programs, and dental hygiene education\
  \ programs for unreimbursed costs they have incurred in providing oral health services\

  \ applicants. The purpose of the DRP is to improve access to oral health care services\
  \ for low income, uninsured, and underserved people with HIV. Provide clinical training\
  \ for dental and dental hygiene students and dental residents to deliver oral health\
  \ care to people with HIV. \n\nCommunity Based Dental Partnership Program (CBDPP):\
