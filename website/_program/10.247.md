  (ECDRE) Program in section 412 of AREERA (7 U.S.C. 7632(j)). Extended by H.R. 6363,
  the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024.  Funding is

  by conducting scientific research and extension activities, technical assistance
  and development activities to combat citrus diseases and pests, both domestic and
  invasive, which pose imminent harm to the U.S. citrus production and threaten industry
  viability. The ECDRE program also combats citrus diseases by supporting the dissemination
  and commercialization of relevant information, techniques, and technologies.
