objective: Section 12605 of the 2018 Farm Bill (Pub. L. 115-334) also established
  the Citrus Trust Fund and provides $25 million, available until expended, for each
  of 2019 through 2023, to carry out the Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension
  (ECDRE) Program in section 412 of AREERA (7 U.S.C. 7632(j)). Extended by H.R. 6363,
  the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024.  Funding is
  for a competitive research and extension grant program to combat diseases of citrus
  by conducting scientific research and extension activities, technical assistance
  and development activities to combat citrus diseases and pests, both domestic and
  invasive, which pose imminent harm to the U.S. citrus production and threaten industry
  viability. The ECDRE program also combats citrus diseases by supporting the dissemination
  and commercialization of relevant information, techniques, and technologies.
