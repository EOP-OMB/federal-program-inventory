  \ communities, mentoring, case management, cognitive–behavioral programs, and reentry\

results:
- description: In FY 2016, funds supported the Reducing Reliance on Confinement and
    Improving Community-Based Responses for Girls at Risk in the Juvenile Justice
    System Initiative to strengthen and expand the use of community-based and gender
    and culturally responsive programs for girls and promote the development of girls
    and their individual strengths
  year: '2016'
- description: Five sites received funding in FY16 and FY17.  Two sites will receive
    funding in FY18.  All five jurisdictions have formed collaborative approaches
    across private and governmental agencies to improve the juvenile justice system’s
    response to girls, including the development of early intervention and prevention
    strategies.
  year: '2017'
- description: The goal of this project is to strengthen and expand the use of community-based,
    gender responsive, trauma informed, strength-based and culturally and linguistically
    appropriate programs for girls at the county level and to reduce the number of
    girls who are held in secure confinement. To achieve this, the grantee is working
    with a local collaborative to enhance the county’s capacity to work effectively
    with girls and to reduce arrests of girls who commit non-serious delinquent acts.  The
    grantee is currently working on a strategic plan with a girls coordinating council.  This
    group was recently created and charged with creating developmentally appropriate
    gender responsive services for girls and to identify and address potential gaps.  The
    grantee hopes to increase collaboration among service providers and government
    agencies to address girls’ needs; increase understanding of why to girls become
    involved in the local juvenile justice system; increase the availability of services
    offered through the county’s Girls Court.
  year: '2018'
- description: OJJDP also continued fiscal support to two of the original five program
    site grantees – Vera Institute of Justice and the PACE Center for Girls -  with
    an expanded emphasis for these sites to focus on efforts to prevent and intervene
    with girls who are vulnerable to trafficking and therefore at risk of entering
    the juvenile justice system.
