objective: 'This funding supports State health agencies, universities, and public
  and private nonprofit organizations in planning, implementing, coordinating, or
  evaluating programs related to autism and other developmental disabilities and the
  improvement of infant and child health and developmental outcomes. Programs may
  include the following activities: conducting epidemiologic research or surveillance;
  providing a national, State or local platform in the area of autism and developmental
  disabilities prevention that focuses on improving early identification of children
  with autism and other developmental disabilities so children and families can get
  the services and support they need; enhancing existing research or surveillance
  programs to better address research questions, monitor changes in prevalence and
  contributing factors, and inform policy and program activities; employing epidemiological
  methods to set priorities, build capacity and direct health promotion interventions
  for persons with autism and other developmental disabilities; disseminating data
  and health information; employing strategies to reduce racial/ethnic disparities
  in the identification of autism and other developmental disabilities; and expanding
  public health training opportunities through fellowships to introduce geneticists,
  epidemiologists, and clinicians to public health practice through education, training
  and career-enhancing experiences. '
