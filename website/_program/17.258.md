objective: 'Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) authorized
  three of the six core programs included under WIOA.  The Adult Program is one of
  the three core programs.  The program serves individuals and helps employers meet
  their workforce needs.  It enables workers to obtain good jobs by providing them
  with job search assistance and training opportunities.  WIOA establishes a priority
  requirement with respect to funds allocated to a local area for adult employment
  and training activities.  American Job Center staff, when using WIOA Adult funds
  to provide individualized career services and training services, must give priority
  to recipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals, and individuals
  who are basic skills deficient.  Performance program measures include: 1. Employed
  2nd Quarter After Exit;  2. Employed 4th Quarter After Exit;  3. Median Earnings
  Second Quarter After Exit;  4. Credential Attainment Rate;  5. Measurable Skills
  Gains; and Effectiveness in Serving Employers. The employment goals are measured
  by using the Unemployment Insurance Wage Records Information System whenever possible.'
