objective: 'Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) authorized
  three of the six core programs included under WIOA.  The Adult Program is one of
  the three core programs.  The program serves individuals and helps employers meet
  their workforce needs.  It enables workers to obtain good jobs by providing them
  with job search assistance and training opportunities.  WIOA establishes a priority
  requirement with respect to funds allocated to a local area for adult employment
  and training activities.  American Job Center staff, when using WIOA Adult funds
  to provide individualized career services and training services, must give priority
  to recipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals, and individuals
  who are basic skills deficient.  Performance program measures include: 1. Employed
  2nd Quarter After Exit;  2. Employed 4th Quarter After Exit;  3. Median Earnings
  Second Quarter After Exit;  4. Credential Attainment Rate;  5. Measurable Skills
  Gains; and Effectiveness in Serving Employers. The employment goals are measured
  by using the Unemployment Insurance Wage Records Information System whenever possible.'

- description: 'The WIOA Title I Adult Program helps prepare adult job seekers, particularly
    those who are low income or low skilled, for good jobs, through formula grants
    to states.  States use the funds to provide employment and training services through
    a network of approximately 2,400 American Job Centers (AJCs).  WIOA provides employment
    and training services at three broad service levels to job seeker customers: basic
    and individualized career services, and training services.  The Adult Program
    serves the broadest range of individuals, including, but not limited to, low income
    and public assistance recipients, basic skills deficient, migrant and seasonal
    farmworkers, Indian and Native Americans, and workers age 55 and older.

    In Fiscal Year 2019, the WIOA Adult Program served more than 544,000 participants.  Of
    those, more than 168,000 received training services, and more than 108,000 were
    low income individuals.  Of the more than 168,000 individuals in training, 45.8
    percent had a Measurable Skills Gain, and 65.6 percent of exiters from training
    attained an industry-recognized credential.'
  year: '2019'
- description: The Adult program operates on a program year (PY) basis (July 1 through
    June 30).  DOL allocates funding to states based on a statutory formula pursuant
    to WIOA section 132(b).  After reserving up to 15 percent of those funds for statewide
    activities, the states allocate the remainder to local workforce areas based on
    a formula distribution as described in WIOA section 133(b).  For the first three
    quarters of Program Year (PY) 2020, the WIOA Adult program served more than 370,000
    participants; of those, more than 188,000 received training services, and more
    than 230,000 were low income individuals.  More than 268,000 were employed in
    the 2nd quarter after exit, and had a median earnings of more than $7,400 in the
    2nd quarter after exit (months 4-6).
  year: '2020'
- description: For PY 2022, $867,000,000 was obligated for the WIOA Adult program;
    for PY 2023, $883,000,000 has been obligated.  The recipients of these funds are
    the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the outlying areas.  However,
    as of PY 2023, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 allows the outlying
    areas the option to submit a single application according to the requirements
    established by the Secretary for a consolidated grant for Adult, Dislocated Worker
    and Youth funds.  Please refer to CFDA 17.290.  PY allotments are comprised of
    Base funds (beginning of PY) + Advance funds (beginning of fiscal year).  Performance
    data is available for PY 2021 at   https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/performance/wioa-performance.  Performance
    data for PY 2022 will be available later this year.
