objective: Projects provide economic, sociological, public policy, and other information
  needed by Federal and State natural resource administrators for conserving and managing
  fishery resources and protected species and their environment in Federal, State,
  and U.S. territorial waters.  Information derived from project studies may consist
  of econometric data, user profiles, sociological case studies, policy and systems
  analyses, and other knowledge, and is used in such decisions as resource allocations,
  total and zonal harvest determinations, and initial apportionment of harvesting
  rights under controlled access management regimes.  Primary users of project information
  include the National Marine Fisheries Service, Regional Fishery Management Councils,
  Interstate Marine Fisheries Commissions, State, and other Federal resource management
  agencies.
