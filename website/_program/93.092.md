objective: "The purpose of this program is to support projects that educate youth\
  \ between 10 and 19 years of age and pregnant and parenting youth under age 21 on\
  \ abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted\
  \ infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency\
  \ syndrome (AIDS). Funds will support the implementation of projects that replicate\
  \ evidence-based, effective programs, or substantially incorporate elements of effective\
  \ programs that have been proven, on the basis of rigorous scientific research to\
  \ change behavior, which means delaying sexual activity, increasing condom or contraceptive\
  \ use for sexually active youth, or reducing pregnancy among youth. Projects are\
  \ further required to incorporate at least three of six adulthood preparation subjects,\
  \ to include healthy life skills, adolescent development, parent-child communication,\
  \ financial literacy, educational and career success, and healthy relationships.\n\
  \nThe overall goal of the Competitive PREP program is to educate adolescents on\
  \ both abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and STIs, including\
  \ HIV/AIDS. The following are objectives of the Competitive PREP program: \n1.\t\
