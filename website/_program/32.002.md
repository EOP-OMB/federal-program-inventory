objective: Universal service has been defined by Congress as “an evolving level of
  telecommunications services . . . taking into account advances in telecommunications
  and information technologies and services.” 47 U.S.C. 254(c).  Universal service
  support generally is distributed only to eligible telecommunications carriers and
  must be used “only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and
  services for which the support is intended.”  47 U.S.C. 254(e).  In addition, policies
  for the advancement and preservation of universal service must be based on certain
  principles established by Congress.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(b).  Consistent with these
  statutory provisions, the FCC has established the Universal Service Fund, which
  disburses support for the provision of telecommunications services, as well as other
  services and facilities (including broadband) for high-cost areas, schools and libraries,
  rural health care providers, and low-income consumers.
