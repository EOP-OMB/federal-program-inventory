objective: "The Tribal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program\
  \ (Tribal MIECHV) is administered by The Administration for Children and Families\
  \ (ACF) Office of Early Childhood Development (ECD), in collaboration with the Health\
  \ Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Assistance is available to: 1) eligible\
  \ Tribes (or consortia of Tribes),  2) Tribal Organizations, and 3) Urban Indian\
  \ Organizations, to strengthen and improve maternal and child health programs, improve\
  \ service coordination for at-risk communities, and identify and provide comprehensive\
  \ evidence-based home visiting services to families who reside in at-risk communities\
  \ through implementing evidence-based home visiting. \n\nThe goals of the Tribal\
  \ MIECHV program are to: 1) support the development of happy, healthy, and successful\
  \ American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) children and families through a coordinated\
  \ home visiting strategy that addresses critical maternal and child health, development,\
  \ early learning, family support, and child abuse and neglect prevention needs;\
  \ 2) implement high-quality, culturally-relevant, evidence-based home visiting programs\
  \ in AIAN communities; 3) expand the evidence base around home visiting interventions\
  \ with Native populations; and 4) support and strengthen cooperation and coordination\
  \ and promote linkages among various early childhood programs, resulting in coordinated,\
  \ comprehensive early childhood systems.\n\nThe ACF, Office of Planning, Research\
  \ and Evaluation (OPRE),  is administering  Tribal Research Center for Early Childhood\
  \ Development and Systems (TRCECS). The TRCECS provides leadership and collaboration\
  \ to promote excellence in community-based participatory research and evaluation\
  \ of ACF early childhood initiatives that serve tribal communities. \n\n\nThe 2021\
  \ American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) (P.L. 117-2)  dedicated funds for entities that\
  \ are conducting a MIECHV program as of the date of enactment of the legislation\
  \ and can be used for provision of home visiting services (including virtual visits),\
  \ and training staff in conducting virtual home visits, and increase the number\
  \ of at-risk families receiving home visiting services during the pandemic and ensure\
  \ that current and additional families are able to obtain basic necessities."
