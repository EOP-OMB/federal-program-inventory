objective: "The Tribal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program\
  \ (Tribal MIECHV) is administered by The Administration for Children and Families\
  \ (ACF) Office of Early Childhood Development (ECD), in collaboration with the Health\
  \ Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Assistance is available to eligible\
  \ Tribes (or consortia of Tribes), Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations,\
  \ to strengthen and improve maternal and child health programs, improve service\
  \ coordination for at-risk communities, and identify and provide comprehensive evidence-based\
  \ home visiting services to families who reside in at-risk communities through implementing\
  \ evidence-based home visiting. \n\nThe goals of the Tribal MIECHV program are to:\
  \ support the development of happy, healthy, and successful American Indian and\
  \ Alaska Native (AIAN) children and families through a coordinated home visiting\
  \ strategy that addresses critical maternal and child health, development, early\
  \ learning, family support, and child abuse and neglect prevention needs; implement\
  \ high-quality, culturally-relevant, evidence-based home visiting programs in AIAN\
  \ communities; expand the evidence base around home visiting interventions with\
  \ Native populations; and support and strengthen cooperation and coordination and\
  \ promote linkages among various early childhood programs, resulting in coordinated,\
  \ comprehensive early childhood systems.\n\nThe ACF, Office of Planning, Research\
  \ and Evaluation (OPRE),  is administering  Tribal Research Center for Early Childhood\
  \ Development and Systems (TRCECS). The TRCECS provides leadership and collaboration\
  \ to promote excellence in community-based participatory research and evaluation\
  \ of ACF early childhood initiatives that serve tribal communities. \n\n\nThe 2021\
  \ American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) (P.L. 117-2)  dedicated funds for entities that\
  \ are conducting a MIECHV program as of the date of enactment of the legislation\
  \ and can be used for provision of home visiting services (including virtual visits),\
  \ and training staff in conducting virtual home visits, and increase the number\
  \ of at-risk families receiving home visiting services during the pandemic and ensure\
  \ that current and additional families are able to obtain basic necessities."
