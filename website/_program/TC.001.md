objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent
  accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. For example,
  a rental voucher of $100 is (approximately) equal in value to $100 of cash income.
  In contrast to this treatment, certain housing and meals, in addition to other benefits
  provided military personnel, either in cash or in kind, as well as certain amounts
  of pay related to combat service, are excluded from income subject to tax.
