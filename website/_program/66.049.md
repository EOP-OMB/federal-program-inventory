objective: 'Section 60101 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (or IRA) amended
  the Clean Air Act by inserting section 132 (42 U.S.C. 7432) to authorize the EPA
  to make awards of grants to eligible recipients for up to 100 percent of the costs
  for: (A) the incremental costs of replacing an eligible vehicle that is not a zero-emission
  vehicle with a zero-emission vehicle; (B) purchasing, installing, operating, and
  maintaining infrastructure needed to charge, fuel, or maintain zero-emission vehicles;
  (C) workforce development and training to support the maintenance, charging, fueling,
  and operation of zero-emission vehicles; and (D) planning and technical activities
  to support the adoption and deployment of zero-emission vehicles. IRA appropriates
  $1 billion for the program, $400 million of which must be spent on projects to replace
  eligible vehicles that serve 1 or more communities located in an air quality area
  designated pursuant as nonattainment for any air pollutant. The EPA’s objectives
  for the Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicles Program are to: (1) reduce air pollution, especially
  in non-attainment areas and areas with environmental justice concerns; and (2) encourage
  the sustainable deployment of Class 6-7 zero emission vehicles.


  Funding priorities – FY 2024: The EPA plans to competitively award funding for replacing
  eligible vehicles with zero-emission vehicles; purchasing, installing, operating,
  and maintaining infrastructure needed to charge, fuel, or maintain zero-emission
  vehicles; workforce development and training to support the maintenance, charging,
  fueling, and operation of zero-emission vehicles; and planning and technical activities
  to support the adoption and deployment of zero-emission vehicles.'
