objective: 'The statutory authority for this project is CERCLA 117(e) as amended by
  42 USC 9617(e); it authorizes Technical Assistance Grants to be awarded to groups
  of individuals affected by or threatened by a release at a Superfund site so that
  they can obtain independent technical assistance to interpret site-related documents
  and share this information to the rest of the community. The objective of each TAG
  is to procure an independent technical advisor(s) to review and inform the community
  on EPA documents related to cleaning up the Superfund site that is affecting them.
  The goal of each TAG is that the technical advisor''s information aids the community
  in the preparation of public comments which assists the community to more meaningfully
  participate in the cleanup decision-making process.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  Only one grant is available per site, at
  any time. EPA does not prioritize among eligible sites. All TAG applications are
  given equal priority as long as the site and group are eligible. The applicant group
  must meet minimum administrative and management capability requirements by demonstrating
  they have or will have reliable procedures for record keeping and financial accountability
  related to TAG management. In addition, all applications must address the following:
  plans for using a technical advisor''s services, plans and ability to inform other
  members of the community, and the group''s membership (representative of the different
  individuals/groups affected by the site). Funding must be used to obtain technical
  assistance so that the community better understand technical issues related to the
  cleanup of the Superfund site affecting them and to provide comments on technical
  and decisions throughout the cleanup process. Groups may obtain a technical advisor
  to help them understand site-related documents and information, such as: the nature
  of the environmental and public health hazards at the site; the various stages of
  health and environmental investigations; cleanup and operation and maintenance activities
  for a site; exposure investigation and health studies; site monitoring plans and
  reports; the remedial investigation feasibility study, record of decision, remedial
  design documents; site reuse options and considerations; selection and construction
  of remedial action; removal activities; and operation and maintenance.'
