objective: "The statutory authority for this project is CERCLA 117(e) as amended by\
  \ 42 USC 9617(e); it authorizes Technical Assistance Grants (TAGs) to be awarded\
  \ to groups of individuals affected by or threatened by a release at a Superfund\
  \ site so that they can obtain independent technical assistance to interpret site-related\
  \ documents and share this information to the rest of the community. The objective\
  \ of each TAG is to procure an independent technical advisor(s) to review and inform\
  \ the community on EPA documents related to cleaning up the Superfund site that\
  \ is affecting them. The goal of each TAG is that the technical advisor's information\
  \ aids the community in the preparation of public comments which assists the community\
  \ to more meaningfully participate in the cleanup decision-making process.\n\nOnly\
  \ one grant is available per site, at any time. EPA does not prioritize among eligible\
  \ sites. All TAG applications are given equal priority as long as the site and group\
  \ are eligible. The applicant group must meet eligibility requirements, and minimum\
  \ administrative and management capability requirements by demonstrating they have\
  \ or will have reliable procedures for record keeping and financial accountability\
  \ related to TAG management. In addition, all applications must address the following:\
  \ plans for using a technical advisor's services, plans and ability to inform other\
  \ members of the community, and the group's membership (representative of the different\
  \ individuals/groups affected by the site). \n\nFunding must be used to obtain technical\
  \ assistance so that the community better understand technical issues related to\
  \ the cleanup of the Superfund site affecting them and to provide comments on technical\
  \ and decisions throughout the cleanup process. Groups may obtain a technical advisor\
  \ to help them understand site-related documents and information, such as: the nature\
  \ of the environmental and public health hazards at the site; the various stages\
  \ of health and environmental investigations; cleanup and operation and maintenance\
  \ activities for a site; exposure investigation and health studies; site monitoring\
  \ plans and reports; the remedial investigation feasibility study, record of decision,\
  \ remedial design documents; site reuse options and considerations; selection and\
  \ construction of remedial action; removal activities; and operation and maintenance."

results:
- description: 'Since the program began on March 24, 1988, through September 30, 2016,
    343 TAG awards have been issued by EPA, totaling almost $31,000,000 (including
    new awards, additional funds, waivers and deviations). In most cases, EPA receives
    only one application for a site and in most cases an award is made. EPA did not
    receive any Letters of Intent (LOIs) from eligible community groups in FY 2016.
    Therefore, no new TAG awards were made in FY 2016. However, eight supplemental
    funding awards were made to existing grantees, totaling $240,000. The grant includes
    an outreach component wherein the grantee helps to educate the broader community
    on issues related to the site cleanup. Under this grant, grantees have developed
    community newsletters, developed web sites, conducted community meetings to help
    other community members better understand technical information related to the
    site cleanup and to better respond to site-related technical documents during
    public comment periods. Technical comments provided to EPA under this grant assist
    EPA in meeting Superfund strategic targets of identifying and controlling unacceptable
    human exposures from site contamination; monitoring and controlling migration
    of contaminated ground water; and identifying a final remedy suitable for stated
    reuse (under Goal 3.2.2 of EPA''s Strategic Plan). Since the program began on
    March 24, 1988, through September 30, 2016, 343 TAG awards have been issued by
    EPA, totaling almost $30,800,000 (including new awards, additional funds, waivers
    and deviations). In most cases, EPA receives only one application for a site and
    in most cases an award is made. EPA did not receive any Letters of Intent (LOIs)
    from eligible community groups in FY 2016. Therefore, no new TAG awards were made
    in FY 2016. However, ten supplemental funding awards were made to existing grantees,
    totaling $305,000. The grant includes an outreach component wherein the grantee
    helps to educate the broader community on issues related to the site cleanup.
    Under this grant, grantees have developed community newsletters, developed web
    sites, conducted community meetings to help other community members better understand
    technical information related to the site cleanup and to better respond to site-related
    technical documents during public comment periods. Technical comments provided
    to EPA under this grant assist EPA in meeting Superfund strategic targets of identifying
    and controlling unacceptable human exposures from site contamination; monitoring
    and controlling migration of contaminated ground water; and identifying a final
    remedy suitable for stated reuse (under Goal 3.2.2 of EPA''s Strategic Plan). '

    to existing grantees, and one new TAG award totaling $25,000. Funding enabled
    community-based groups to procure independent technical assistance to help them
    and their community better understand Superfund site technical information and
    be more involved in the cleanup decisions.
  year: '2024'
- description: In FY 2025 EPA estimates awarding four supplemental funding awards
    totaling $150,000 to existing grantees and one new TAG awards totaling $50,000.
    Funding will enable community-based groups to procure independent technical assistance
    to help them and their community better understand Superfund site technical information
