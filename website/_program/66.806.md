objective: 'The statutory authority for this project is CERCLA 117(e) as amended by
  42 USC 9617(e); it authorizes Technical Assistance Grants to be awarded to groups
  of individuals affected by or threatened by a release at a Superfund site so that
  they can obtain independent technical assistance to interpret site-related documents
  and share this information to the rest of the community. The objective of each TAG
  is to procure an independent technical advisor(s) to review and inform the community
  on EPA documents related to cleaning up the Superfund site that is affecting them.
  The goal of each TAG is that the technical advisor''s information aids the community
  in the preparation of public comments which assists the community to more meaningfully
  participate in the cleanup decision-making process.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  Only one grant is available per site, at
  any time. EPA does not prioritize among eligible sites. All TAG applications are
  given equal priority as long as the site and group are eligible. The applicant group
  must meet minimum administrative and management capability requirements by demonstrating
  they have or will have reliable procedures for record keeping and financial accountability
  related to TAG management. In addition, all applications must address the following:
  plans for using a technical advisor''s services, plans and ability to inform other
  members of the community, and the group''s membership (representative of the different
  individuals/groups affected by the site). Funding must be used to obtain technical
  assistance so that the community better understand technical issues related to the
  cleanup of the Superfund site affecting them and to provide comments on technical
  and decisions throughout the cleanup process. Groups may obtain a technical advisor
  to help them understand site-related documents and information, such as: the nature
  of the environmental and public health hazards at the site; the various stages of
  health and environmental investigations; cleanup and operation and maintenance activities
  for a site; exposure investigation and health studies; site monitoring plans and
  reports; the remedial investigation feasibility study, record of decision, remedial
  design documents; site reuse options and considerations; selection and construction
  of remedial action; removal activities; and operation and maintenance.'

- description: 'Since the program began on March 24, 1988, through September 30, 2016,
    343 TAG awards have been issued by EPA, totaling almost $31,000,000 (including
    new awards, additional funds, waivers and deviations). In most cases, EPA receives
    only one application for a site and in most cases an award is made. EPA did not
    receive any Letters of Intent (LOIs) from eligible community groups in FY 2016.
    Therefore, no new TAG awards were made in FY 2016. However, eight supplemental
    funding awards were made to existing grantees, totaling $240,000. The grant includes
    an outreach component wherein the grantee helps to educate the broader community
    on issues related to the site cleanup. Under this grant, grantees have developed
    community newsletters, developed web sites, conducted community meetings to help
    other community members better understand technical information related to the
    site cleanup and to better respond to site-related technical documents during
    public comment periods. Technical comments provided to EPA under this grant assist
    EPA in meeting Superfund strategic targets of identifying and controlling unacceptable
    human exposures from site contamination; monitoring and controlling migration
    of contaminated ground water; and identifying a final remedy suitable for stated
    reuse (under Goal 3.2.2 of EPA''s Strategic Plan). Since the program began on
    March 24, 1988, through September 30, 2016, 343 TAG awards have been issued by
    EPA, totaling almost $30,800,000 (including new awards, additional funds, waivers
    and deviations). In most cases, EPA receives only one application for a site and
    in most cases an award is made. EPA did not receive any Letters of Intent (LOIs)
    from eligible community groups in FY 2016. Therefore, no new TAG awards were made
    in FY 2016. However, ten supplemental funding awards were made to existing grantees,
    totaling $305,000. The grant includes an outreach component wherein the grantee
    helps to educate the broader community on issues related to the site cleanup.
    Under this grant, grantees have developed community newsletters, developed web
    sites, conducted community meetings to help other community members better understand
    technical information related to the site cleanup and to better respond to site-related
    technical documents during public comment periods. Technical comments provided
    to EPA under this grant assist EPA in meeting Superfund strategic targets of identifying
    and controlling unacceptable human exposures from site contamination; monitoring
    and controlling migration of contaminated ground water; and identifying a final
    remedy suitable for stated reuse (under Goal 3.2.2 of EPA''s Strategic Plan). '
