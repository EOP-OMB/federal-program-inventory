results:
- description: "Protected 5,629 acres of lands that were at risk of incompatible development\
    \ adjacent to ten ARNG installations.\n•\tThis eliminated the risk of 57 single\
    \ family homes within the installation’s high-risk noise contours of the range\
    \ complex. The property will be managed as open space for future public recreational\
    \ use and habitat preservation for rare species.\n•\tAssisted in the purchase\
    \ of a keystone parcel that is within the approach to landing zones used in helicopter\
    \ training on the installation that would have been subdivided into 35 home sites.\
    \ The property was transferred to the local municipality, which has used the land\
    \ to connect two adjacent parks with a trail for recreation from the community.\
    \ The property will be managed at no cost to the military to reduce wildfire risks\
    \ to the installation.\n•\tAssisted in the purchase of a former golf course had\
    \ previously been rezoned and subdivided for the construction of 400+ residences\
    \ that would lie within the approach at Muir Army National Guard Airfield. This\
    \ project eliminated the potential for a large volume of noise complaints in a\
    \ heavily trafficked aviation corridor and preserves land for agricultural and\
    \ species habitat use."
