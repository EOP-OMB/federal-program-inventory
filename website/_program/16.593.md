    \nThe RSAT Program accomplishments: \n\u2022\tSupported the participation of approximately\
    \ 21,000 individuals in RSAT programs in FY 2021 with all receiving substance\
    \ use treatment services. Participants receiving residential services in jail\
    \ are suggested to remain in the program for a minimum of 3 months, while participants\
    \ in prison-based programs must remain in the program for a minimum of 6 months.\
    \ In addition to receiving treatment for substance use disorder treatment, many\
    \ program participants also receive cognitive behavioral therapies and employment,\
    \ transitional housing, and/or mental health services. In 2021, nearly 69 percent\
    \ of jail- and prison-based participants successfully completed all program requirements.\
    \ \n\u2022\tContinue to promulgate the national standards for prison and jail\
    \ substance use disorder treatment, Promising Practices Guidelines (PPG) for Residential\
    \ Substance Use Treatment. In 2019, BJA initiated a national program to assist\
    \ RSAT programs in meeting program standards, creating and piloting a fidelity\
    \ assessment in prison and jail RSAT programs in several states. In 2021, the\
    \ PPGs were updated and fidelity assessment interview was revised to include updated\
    \ research and program highlights. To date, fifty-one fidelity assessments have\
    \ been completed in thirty seventwenty two states with corresponding training\
    \ and technical assistance (TTA) recommendations to improve services in alignment\
    \ with the PPGs. It is expected that a fidelity assessment will have been conducted\
    \ with at least one program from each U.S. state and territory by the end of FY\
    \ 2022. The efficacy of the assistance will continue to be measured and adjusted\
    \ as required in conjunction with updates and revisions to the PPGs.    \n\u2022\
    \tIn previous fiscal years, the RSAT TTA provider worked with prisons and jails\
    \ to conduct on-site training for correctional teams interested in replicating\
    \ services of model programs. Due to recent travel restrictions in fiscal years\
    \ 2020 and 2021, the RSAT TTA provider increased the number of virtual training\
    \ webinars and online technical assistance via tele-conferencing, and developed\
    \ a geo-map of RSAT programs linking to a compendium of program descriptions highlighting\
    \ RSAT-supported programs.\n\u2022\tContinue to champion the expansion of Medication-Assisted\
    \ Treatment (MAT) as an essential component of successful re-entry for inmates\
    \ with alcohol and opioid use disorders. Jails and prisons with model best practice\
    \ programs have been showcased through national webinars, onsite training sessions,\
    \ and a national meeting of prison, jail, and juvenile correctional practitioners\
    \ across the country.  In 2021, approximately 50 percent of all RSAT programs\
    \ offered MAT to offenders that were deemed eligible."
