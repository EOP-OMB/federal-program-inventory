objective: To provide grants and cooperative agreements for habitat conservation activities
  including coastal and marine habitat restoration and protection. Projects are funded
  to carry out public policy pertaining to protection and restoration of the Nation's
  wetlands, rivers, and other coastal habitats (including Great Lakes habitats), pursuant
  to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
  Act as reauthorized in 2006; Endangered Species Act, Estuary Restoration Act; Marine
  Mammal Protection Act; Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987;
  Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (CWPPRA); Coral Reef Conservation
  Act; Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act; Infrastructure Investment
  and Jobs Act (IIJA); and other legislation. Research and management includes determining
  the effects of habitat modifications and contaminants on populations of living marine
  resources, restoring depleted stocks that have been adversely impacted by habitat
  modifications, determining if artificial or restored habitat fulfills essential
  habitat needs of living marine resources, and the removal of dams and other in-stream
  barriers to support passage for native migratory or sea-run fish, and quantifying
  contaminants and debris that pose a hazard to populations of these animals.
