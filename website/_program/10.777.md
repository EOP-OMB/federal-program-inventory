results:
- description: In FY2022, 20 Fellows representing 14 countries conducted hands-on
    developmental research in plant and animal health, biotechnology, high-yield plant
    breeding, and other topics, improving the understanding of these fields in their
    home countries.

- description: Eight Borlaug Fellows were trained in 2023. It was reported in 2023
    that the Borlaug Fellowship Program contributed to research on a high-yield rice
    variety resistant to disease and humid conditions, leading to the development
    of a reliable molecular toolbox for simultaneous analysis of multiple functional
    genes in rice and superior grain quality. The collaboration remains ongoing and
    will seek to identify genes associated with an increased tolerance to dry periods
    used in the alternative wetting and drying technique, which allows for less water
    usage and greenhouse gas emissions in the rice growing process.
