objective: '"The NSF Directorate for Engineering (ENG) seeks to improve the quality
  of life and the economic strength of the Nation by fostering innovation, creativity,
  and excellence in engineering research and education . Specifically, ENG enables
  the Nation''s long-term capacity to perform by: (1) investing in the creation of
  new engineering knowledge and the development of human capital within disciplines
  and at their interfaces; (2) making critical investments to enable an intelligent,
  agile and adaptable physical infrastructure for engineering research and education;
  (3) improving the quality and effectiveness of engineering research and education
  through the integration of and systemic reform of these processes; and (4) enabling
  knowledge transfer connections among diverse constituencies and communities.  Areas
  of research include: chemical and biochemical systems; environmental engineering
  and sustainability; bioengineering and engineering healthcare; fundamental transport,
  thermal and fluid phenomena; the future of manufacturing; the design of innovative
  materials and building technologies; infrastructure resilience and sustainability;
  tools and systems for decision-making, robotics and controls; electronic, magnetic,
  photonic and quantum devices and component technologies; energy and power; computation,
  networking, communications, and cyber technologies to support the integration and
  networking of intelligent systems;; the and cross-cutting activities and special
  studies and analyses. ENG supports programs for Emerging Frontiers in Research and
  Innovation (EFRI); Engineering Research Centers (ERC); Industry-University Cooperative
  Research Centers (IUCRC); and research instrumentation and research infrastructure,
  including the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) and the
  National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI). Support is also provided
  for undergraduate student research, graduate research fellowships, postdoctoral
  fellowships, broadening participation in engineering, engineering education research,
  and workforce development. ENG also provides support for NSF-wide programs, including
  the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program and the Eddie Bernice Johnson
  INCLUDES Initiative (Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented
  Discoverers in Engineering and Science).'
