objective: 'The objective of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)
  is to make awards available to states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories,
  and Native American tribes and tribal organizations for the purpose of assisting
  eligible households to meet immediate home energy needs. The target population is
  low-income households, especially those with the lowest incomes and the highest
  home energy costs or needs in relation to income and family size. There are four
  components of LIHEAP: (1) block grants, (2) energy Emergency Contingency funds,
  (3) Leveraging Incentive awards, and (4) the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge
  Program (REACH). Block grant funds are distributed by formula to recipients who
  design their own programs according to very broad federal guidelines. Emergency
  Contingency funds may be awarded to recipients in the event of a natural disaster
  or other emergency and typically must be utilized under the normal statutory and
  regulatory requirements that apply to block grants. Leveraging Incentive funds allows
  for HHS to set aside a portion of appropriated funding to reward recipients that
  have acquired non-federal resources to provide services to LIHEAP-eligible households
  beyond what could be provided by other federal funds. The REACH program makes competitive
  awards available to recipients to help eligible households reduce their energy vulnerability
  through community-based organizations. Contingency funds, Leveraging Incentive awards,
  and REACH funding are only administered when funding for those components is available
  and allocated to them. This program is administered by the Department of Health
  and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Office of
  Community Services.'
