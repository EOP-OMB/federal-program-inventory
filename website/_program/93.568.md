objective: 'The objective of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)
  is to make awards available to States, the District of Columbia, US Territories,
  and Native American Tribes and Tribal organizations for the purpose of assisting
  eligible households to meet immediate home energy needs. The target population is
  low-income households, especially those with the lowest incomes and the highest
  home energy costs or needs in relation to income and family size. There are four
  components of LIHEAP: (1) block grants, (2) energy emergency contingency funds,
  (3) leveraging incentive awards, and (4) the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge
  Program (REACH). Block grant funds are distributed by formula to grant recipients
  who design their own programs according to very broad federal guidelines. Contingency
  funds may be awarded to grant recipients in the event of a natural disaster or other
  emergency and typically must be utilized under the normal statutory and regulatory
  requirements that apply to block grants.  Supplemental Leveraging Incentive funds
  allows for HHS to set aside a portion of appropriated funding to reward grant recipients
  that have acquired non-federal resources to provide services to LIHEAP-eligible
  households beyond what could be provided by Federal funds. The REACH program makes
  competitive grants available to grant recipients to help eligible households reduce
  their energy vulnerability through community-based organizations. Contingency funds,  leveraging
  incentive awards, and REACH funding are only administered when funding for those
  components is available and allocated to them. This program is administered by the
  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Children and Families
  (ACF) Office of Community Services.'
