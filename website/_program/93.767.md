objective: "The objective of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is\
  \ to provide funds to States to enable them to maintain and expand child health\
  \ assistance to uninsured, low-income children, and at a state option, low-income\
  \ pregnant women and legal immigrants, primarily by three methods: (1) operating\
  \ a separate CHIP program; (2) expanding eligibility for children under the State's\
  \ Medicaid program; and (3) or operating both a separate CHIP and a Medicaid expansion\
  \ program. \nThe objective of the Connecting Kids to Coverage (CKC) Outreach and\
  \ Enrollment Grants is to reduce the number of uninsured children eligible for Medicaid,\
  \ CHIP and insurance affordability programs who are not enrolled and improve retention\
  \ of those who are already enrolled. The latest cohort of grants were authorized\
  \ under Section 3004(a) of the Helping Ensure Access for Little Ones, Toddlers,\
  \ and Hopeful Youth by Keeping Insurance Delivery Stable Act (referred to as the\
  \ HEALTHY KIDS Act and included in Pub. L. 115-120). CMS awarded a total of $48\
  \ million to eligible entities, including states, local governments, schools, health\
  \ care providers, community-based public or non-profit organizations, and Indian\
  \ tribes or tribal consortiums, tribal organizations, urban Indian organizations\
  \ receiving funds under Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C.\
  \ 1651 et seq.), and Indian Health Service providers. These grants support outreach\
  \ strategies aimed at increasing enrollment of eligible, but not enrolled,children\
  \ in Medicaid and CHIP, emphasizing outreach and enrollment activities tailored\
  \ to communities where eligible children and families reside and enlisting community\
  \ leaders and programs that serve eligible children and families. These grants also\
  \ fund activities designed to help families understand application procedures and\
  \ health coverage opportunities under Medicaid and CHIP. The Centers for Medicare\
  \ & Medicaid Services (CMS) also made awards of $6 million exclusively for Indian\
  \ health care providers and tribal entities to conduct outreach and enrollment activities\
  \ aimed at American Indians and Alaska Natives. Indian health care providers and\
  \ tribal entities were permitted to apply for either or both funding opportunities\
  \ as long as the work described was different in each proposal."
