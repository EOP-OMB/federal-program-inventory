objective: To identify and provide information needed to sustain subsistence fisheries
  and wildlife management on Federal public lands, for rural Alaskans, through a multidisciplinary,
  collaborative program. Two programs are administered under the Alaska National Interest
  Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) to fulfill this objective. The Fisheries Resource
  Monitoring Program (Monitoring Program) funds approximately 40 studies annually
  to provide information on stock status and trends, harvests, and traditional ecological
  knowledge to manage and regulate Federal subsistence fisheries. The Partners for
  Fisheries Monitoring Program (Partners Program) strengthens Alaska Native and rural
  involvement in subsistence fisheries management and research. The program provides
  funds directly to Alaska Native and rural organizations to hire fishery biologists,
  social scientists, and educators with the intent of increasing the organizations
  ability to participate in Federal Subsistence Management.
