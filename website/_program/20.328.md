  the conditions of performance, nondiscrimination requirements, and other assurances
  made applicable to the award of funds in accordance with regulations of the Department

  promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget. In complying with these requirements,

  reimburse any expended award funds. Examples of administrative and national policy

  civil rights laws and regulations; requirements for disadvantaged business enterprises,
  debarment and suspension requirements, and drug-free workplace requirements; FRA’s
