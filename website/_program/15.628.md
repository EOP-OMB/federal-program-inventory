objective: This program provides funding for sport fish and wildlife restoration projects
  and recruitment, retention and reactivation (R3) projects that address regional
  or national priority needs of State fish and wildlife agencies and their partners
  that are beyond the scale, scope, and capabilities of a single State. The priority
  needs, also known as Strategic Priorities, are identified annually by the Association
  of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (AFWA) with input from State fish and wildlife agencies
  and their partners. Recipients awarded Traditional Multistate Conservation Grants
  (T-MSCG) may use the funds for wildlife or sport fish projects involving research,
  restoration, conservation and management of wild birds, wild mammals, sport fish,
  and their habitats. These funds may also be used for projects providing for public
  use and benefit from these resources, including hunter safety and education, aquatic
  education, angler R3 projects and other purposes consistent with the enabling legislation.
  Recipients awarded under R3 Multistate Conservation Grants (R3-MSCG) can only use
  the funds for hunter recruitment and recreational shooter recruitment projects that
  promote a national hunting and shooting sport recruitment program, including related
  communication and outreach activities.
