objective: This program provides funding for sport fish and wildlife restoration projects
  identified by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. Recipients awarded
  under the Traditional Multistate Conservation Funds (T-MSCGP) may use the funds
  for sport fisheries and wildlife management including research projects, boating
  access development, hunter safety and education, aquatic education, fish and wildlife
  habitat improvements, and other purposes consistent with the enabling legislation.  Recipients
  awarded under the R3 Multistate Conservation Grant Program (R3-MSCGP) can only use
  the funds for making hunter recruitment and recreational shooter recruitment projects
