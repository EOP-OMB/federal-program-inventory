objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including deferred and
  dedicated payments, should be included in taxable income. In addition, investment
  income would be taxed as earned. In contrast, under current law self-employed individuals
  can make deductible contributions to their own retirement plans equal to 25 percent
  of their income, up to a maximum of $69,000 in 2024. Total plan contributions are
  limited to 25 percent of a firmâ€™s total wages. The tax on the investment income
  earned by self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans is deferred until withdrawn.
