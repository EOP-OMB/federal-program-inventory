objective: To effectively identify and protect environmentally important forest areas
  threatened by conversion to nonforest uses, through the use of conservation easements
  or fee simple purchase. The Forest Legacy Program (FLP) is a voluntary private land
  conservation partnership between the Forest Service, participating States, land
  trusts, private landowners, and others. The Program works with State partners and
  operates on a willing seller and willing buyer basis and is completely nonregulatory
  in its approach. No eminent domain authority or adverse condemnation is authorized
  for this Program.
