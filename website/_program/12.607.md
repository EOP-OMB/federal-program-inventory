    or realignments. Grant funds were used to support organizational costs, including

    efforts including redevelopment and business plans for facility reuse. Contractual
    funds also supported infrastructure assessment, environmental consulting services,
    and economic development and marketing strategies. Accomplishments include completion
    of BRAC property conveyance from the Military services and subsequent job creation
    and facility reuse
  year: '2016'
- description: As a result of a $317,693 OEA investment, the Pendleton County Commission
    partnered with West Virginia University and surrounding counties to prepare a
    strategic economic diversification plan in response to the 2015 disestablishment
    of Navy Information Operations Command Sugar Grove. The plan, completed in September
    2019, recommends branding the region as the “Potomac Highlands” and targeting
    companies in the Advanced Materials, and Forest and Wood Product industries to
    bring new employment opportunities to the region.
  year: '2019'
- description: After requesting Navy Base Realignment and Closure property for educational
    uses in 2006, Bowdoin College determined in 2019 that it no longer needed 144
    acres of the original 275. The Navy asked the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment
    Authority (MRRA) to add the property to their existing economic development conveyance.
    MRRA concurred then engaged a consultant to work with MRRA, the Town of Brunswick,
    and the public to develop a land use vision for the parcel to modify the existing
    plan. As part of this process, the consultant documented the existing natural
    and manmade conditions of the land and developed various scenarios based on public
    input for how the land could be used. Because of COVID-19 restrictions on public
    meetings, the consultant developed and deployed an innovative virtual public engagement
    strategy and survey instrument to guide this process. More than 530 people participated
    in the online virtual tours of the parcel and the initial survey. In February
    2021, the Town Council entered into an agreement to purchase the property from
    MRRA for conservation and outdoor recreation purposes.

- description: The 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommended
    the Umatilla Chemical Depot be closed upon completion of the chemical demilitarization
    mission. Located in rural Oregon’s Umatilla and Morrow Counties, the depot closed
    in 2012. Although the regulatory process has extended the timeline for conveyance,
    the Columbia Development Authority’s economic development conveyance application
    for approximately 9,500 acres was approved in 2018. The LRA has updated their
    infrastructure assessment and prepared a site development report in anticipation
    of receiving property from the U.S. Army in Fiscal Year 2022.

- description: In 2014, the U.S. Navy’s Base Realignment and Closure Program Management
    Office-East advised the Horsham Land Redevelopment Authority that high levels
    of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the drinking water would impact their
    ability to transfer 850 acres of the former installation to the Horsham Land Redevelopment
    Authority through an economic development conveyance. In 2023, Office of Local
    Defense Community Cooperation awarded a $380,885 Federal grant that enabled Horsham
    Land Redevelopment Authority, as it awaits transfer of ownership of acreage from
    the U.S. Navy, to manage redevelopment activities at the former Willow Grove Naval
    Air Station to include transportation planning to revitalize the site once PFAS
    contamination and clean up concerns are resolved.
  year: '2023'
- description: In 2024, Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation awarded a $285,077
    Federal grant that enabled the Riverbank Local Redevelopment Authority, as it
    awaits transfer of ownership of acreage from the U.S. Army, to sustain redevelopment
    and environmental remediation efforts at the former Riverbank Army Ammunition
    Plant to include supporting the use of a Finding of Suitability for Early Transfer
    and Covenant Deferral which requires coordination and concurrence by the California
    Governor.
