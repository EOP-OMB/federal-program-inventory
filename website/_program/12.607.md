- description: "The 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommended\
    \ the Umatilla Chemical Depot be closed upon completion of the chemical demilitarization\
    \ mission.  Located in rural Oregon\u2019s Umatilla and Morrow Counties, the depot\
    \ closed in 2012.  Although the regulatory process extended the timeline for conveyance,\
    \ the Columbia Development Authority\u2019s economic development conveyance application\
    \ for approximately 9,500 acres was approved in 2018.  Technical and financial\
    \ assistance enabled the local redevelopment authority to receive and partition\
    \ 9,511 acres transferred from the U.S. Army in Fiscal Year 2023."

- description: "The 2005 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended\
    \ the closure of NAS JRB Willow Grove in Horsham and Warminster Townships and\
    \ Montgomery and Bucks Counties, Pennsylvania.  The 2011 base closure resulted\
    \ in the loss of 684 civilian positions.  In 2014, the U.S. Navy\u2019s Base Realignment\
    \ and Closure Program Management Office-East advised the Horsham Land Redevelopment\
    \ Authority (HLRA) that high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\
    \ in the drinking water would impact their ability to transfer 850 acres of the\
    \ former installation to the HLRA through an economic development conveyance.\
    \  In 2023, Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation technical and financial\
    \ assistance enabled HLRA, as it awaits transfer of ownership of acreage from\
    \ the U.S. Navy, to manage redevelopment activities at the former Willow Grove\
    \ Naval Air Station to include oversight of master development planning to revitalize\
    \ the site once PFAS contamination and clean up concerns are resolved."
