results:
- description: In FY2021, BLCP grantees predominately leaned on HRSA funding to maintain
    a community presence to the greatest extent possible in the face of COVID restrictions.
    In FY2022, funds were deployed to take advantage of the proliferation of vaccines
    and loosening of restrictions to spur a push towards pre-pandemic productivity.
    According to the patient-level data reporting system, BLCP grantees achieved a
    32% average increase in number of miners served between FY2021 and FY2022.
