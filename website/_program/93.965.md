objective: TThe Black Lung Clinics Program aims to reduce the morbidity and mortality
  associated with occupationally-related coal mine dust lung disease (CMDLD) through
  the provision of quality medical, outreach, educational, and benefits counseling
  services to coal miners. The primary objective of the Black Lung Data and Resource
  Center is to improve patient-level data collection and analysis, clinic operations,
  and the quality and breadth of services provided by the Black Lung Clinics Program
  (BLCP) recipients.

results:
- description: The program recently implemented a new reporting system that will better
    allow the clinics, HRSA, and other stakeholders to understand the burden of disease
    in the coal miner patient population.  BLCP recipients worked in concert with
    HRSA and the BLDRC to develop and implement the system which was fully deployed
    in FY19. Quality data for analysis should be available in FY20 and will be used
    to monitor medical, outreach, educational, and benefits counseling services provided.
  year: '2020'
- description: This year, the Black Lung Clinics program achieved 100% cohort representation
    within the BLDRC REDCap data management system. This system was created in order
    to assist with the collection of Patient Level Data (PLD) measures instituted
    in FY19. Complete cohort participation will now assure that all program data can
    be consolidated and accessed in one place. This will facilitate access to data
    for program evaluation and management, and analyses of changes and trends in the
    health of the patient population served by BLCP grantees.
  year: '2021'
- description: In FY2021, BLCP grantees predominately leaned on HRSA funding to maintain
    a community presence to the greatest extent possible in the face of COVID restrictions.
    In FY2022, funds were deployed to take advantage of the proliferation of vaccines
    and loosening of restrictions to spur a push towards pre-pandemic productivity.
    According to the patient-level data reporting system, BLCP grantees achieved a
    32% average increase in number of miners served between FY2021 and FY2022.
