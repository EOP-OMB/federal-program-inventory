objective: "The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a U.S.\
  \ public health surveillance system that tracks antibiotic resistance in enteric\
  \ bacteria from humans, retail meats, and food animals. When antimicrobial drugs\
  \ are used in food-producing animals, they can enrich for populations of resistant\
  \ strains that reach humans via the food supply. The chief goal of the NARMS retail\
  \ food surveillance program is to improve the detection of and surveillance for\
  \ antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria in raw retail food commodities,\
  \ particularly fresh retail meat.\r\n\r\nThe NARMS program is looking to collaborate\
  \ with institutions or organizations to enhance and strengthen antibiotic resistance\
  \ surveillance in retail food specimens. Partnering with the NARMS retail food surveillance\
  \ program will enable the collection of critical data for FDA policy and regulatory\
  \ actions including but not limited to pre-approval safety evaluation of new animal\
  \ antibiotics, determining parameters for the antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine,\
  \ and the ability to provide information to promote interventions to reduce resistance\
  \ among foodborne bacteria. This collaboration will address NARMS programmatic needs\
  \ to implement effective surveillance and response for antibiotic resistance as\
  \ recommended in the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria\
  \ (CARB). \r\n"
