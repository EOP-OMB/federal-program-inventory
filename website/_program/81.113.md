objective: To conduct basic and applied research and development that enhances U.S.
  national security and reduces the global danger from the proliferation of weapons
  of mass destruction and special nuclear materials through needs- driven research
  and development. The emphasis is on developing the requisite technologies to detect
  and deter nuclear proliferation and to meet U.S. nuclear detonation detection goals.
  Research focuses on advanced detection systems and concepts to support current and
  future USG policies. Support also-address the pressing shortfalls in trained professionals
  capable of supporting crucial nuclear nonproliferation missions such as nuclear
  forensics and international safeguards.
