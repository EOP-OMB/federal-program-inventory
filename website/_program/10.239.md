objective: The Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations provides $1,000,000 for
  the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences,
  Engineering, and Medicine to conduct an analysis of current scientific findings
  to determine the links between soils and human health by reviewing existing research
  on the linkages between the human microbiome and soil microbiome, and the direct
  interaction of humans with soils. NIFA requests proposals that focus on identifying
  linkages between soil management practices and the nutrient density of foods for
  human consumption, determining how to best leverage healthy soil management practices
  to maximize benefits and minimize adverse impacts on human health, and exploring
  areas for future research.

- description: There is only one award with this program.  The major goal of this
    project is to respond substantively to a request by Congress. In the FY 2022 Agriculture,
    Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related agencies Appropriations
    Bill, Congress requested a study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
    and Medicine to conduct an analysis of current scientific findings to determine
    the links between human health and soil health by reviewing existing research
    on the connections between the human microbiome and soil microbiome and the direct
    interaction of humans with soils, identifying linkages between soil management
    practices and the nutrient density of foods for human consumption, determining
    how to best leverage healthy soil management practices to maximize benefits and
    minimize adverse impacts on human health, and exploring areas for future research.
