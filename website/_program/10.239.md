objective: "The Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations provides $1,000,000 for\
  \ the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences,\
  \ Engineering, and Medicine within 60 days of the enactment of this Act to conduct\
  \ an analysis of current scientific findings to determine the links between soils\
  \ and human health by reviewing existing research on the linkages between the human\
  \ microbiome and soil microbiome, and the direct interaction of humans with soils.\
  \ NIFA requests proposals that focus on identifying linkages between soil management\
  \ practices and the nutrient density of foods for human consumption, determining\
  \ how to best leverage healthy soil management practices to maximize benefits and\
  \ minimize adverse impacts on human health, and exploring areas for future research.\
  \ A report including the study\u2019s findings and recommendations shall be submitted\
  \ to the Committee not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this\
  \ bill."
