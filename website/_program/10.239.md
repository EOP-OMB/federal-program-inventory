objective: The Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations provides $1,000,000 for
  the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences,
  Engineering, and Medicine within 60 days of the enactment of this Act to conduct
  an analysis of current scientific findings to determine the links between soils
  and human health by reviewing existing research on the linkages between the human
  microbiome and soil microbiome, and the direct interaction of humans with soils.
  NIFA requests proposals that focus on identifying linkages between soil management
  practices and the nutrient density of foods for human consumption, determining how
  to best leverage healthy soil management practices to maximize benefits and minimize
  adverse impacts on human health, and exploring areas for future research. A report
  including the studyâ€™s findings and recommendations shall be submitted to the Committee
  not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this bill.
