  \ services on a per capita basis to foreign national victims of a severe form of\

  \ to coordinate project activities and support the delivery of services through\
  \ the nationwide network of providers.\n\nThe primary purpose of Aspire is to efficiently\
  \ fund time-limited comprehensive case management services on a per capita basis\
  \ to foreign national child and youth victims of a severe form of trafficking in\
  \ persons and potential victims of trafficking seeking HHS certification so they\

  \ fund projects that will build, expand, and sustain organizational and local capacity\
  \ to provide direct services, assistance, and referrals for foreign national adults\

  \ activities for the local community and organizations that may encounter individuals\

  \ Organizations, for staff at relevant levels and divisions, including at a minimum\

  \ staff who oversee procurement and external partners, across the prime’s organization;\
  \ 2)\nBuild the capacity of organizational staff to identify patients or clients\
  \ who are experiencing human trafficking and provide them with coordinated, age-appropriate,\
  \ culturally responsive, trauma-informed, patient-centered, and evidence-based care\
  \ and/or services through ongoing training and engagement; 3) Serve patients or\
  \ clients who are experiencing human trafficking in a coordinated, age-appropriate,\
  \ culturally responsive, trauma-informed, person-centered, and evidence-based way\
  \ and establish a continuum of care by entering into MOUs with local direct service\
  \ providers and multidisciplinary stakeholders willing to receive referrals and\
  \ provide aftercare services that are beyond scope of the prime’s capacity or mission\
  \ to support patients or clients who are experiencing human trafficking;\n4) Conduct\
  \ an organizational audit and develop a strategic action plan that identifies internal\
  \ resources, performance measures, a strategy for ensuring the organization is meaningfully\
  \ integrating the expertise of those with lived experience, commitments to strengthen\
  \ the institutional response to human trafficking, and other related actions;\n\
  5) Produce a situational analysis that demonstrates a thorough understanding of\
  \ the local context, including state anti-trafficking laws, local economies with\
  \ increased risk for human trafficking, existing service delivery gaps, risks and\
  \ service needs of priority populations as determined by the prime recipients, and\
  \ the quality and responsiveness of local partnerships; 6) Develop, implement, and\
  \ evaluate the effectiveness of HTRP and corresponding policies and procedures that\
  \ include best practices for working with law enforcement and making referrals when\
  \ serving patients or clients in service settings who have experienced human trafficking\
  \ to further refine and enhance project implementation. HTRP must comply with federal,\
  \ state, local, and tribal laws, including legal confidentiality requirements for\
  \ patients and healthcare providers; 7) Participate in the external evaluation of\
  \ the SOAR Demonstration Program (if applicable).\n\nThe NHTH provides 24/7, yearlong,\
  \ timely, person-centered, trauma-informed, culturally responsive, and linguistically\
  \ appropriate emergency assistance and information to potential domestic and foreign\
  \ victims of sex and labor trafficking. Under the NHTH, the following activities\
  \ are required: operate the NHTH, a 24/7 U.S. national hotline that receives signals\
  \ through telephone, text, chat, and website; promote NHTH services to increase\
  \ the identification and protection of victims of severe forms of human trafficking;\
  \ provide information and service referrals to victims of trafficking using a trauma-informed,\
  \ person-centered, culturally responsive, and linguistically appropriate approach,\
  \ and in a timely manner; and notify law enforcement agencies of potential cases\
  \ of human trafficking, as well as instances when a trafficking victim is in imminent\
  \ danger, and document emerging trafficking schemes to assist in the detection and\
  \ investigation of trafficking cases. The NHTH must respond to and track calls and\
  \ texts in a timely manner; operate website and respond to online signals; maintain\
  \ national coverage to serve the U.S. and all U.S. territories; develop and maintain\
  \ a referral database; and raise awareness about NHTH and resources."
