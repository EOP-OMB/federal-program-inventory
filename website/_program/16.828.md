  \ is to provide state, local, and tribal community supervision agencies with information,\
  \ resources, and training and technical assistance (TTA) to engage in collaborative\
  \ problem-solving with stakeholders using data and research-informed strategies\
  \ to assess and improve responses to client behavior in accordance with the principles\
  \ of swiftness, certainty, and fairness; improve supervision outcomes; prevent recidivism;\
  \ and reduce crime in their jurisdictions. \n\nThe objectives of the SCF initiative\
  \ are to:\n\nDevelop and implement supervision strategies based on SCF principles,\
  \ including responses to both positive and negative client behaviors; Reduce crime\
  \ committed by, and improve outcomes for, people under supervision.\nIdentify a\
  \ target population for the SCF initiative using a collaborative, data-driven process\
  \ that is responsive to local circumstances; Evaluate the efficacy of SCF strategies\
  \ to reduce recidivism and improve outcomes for people under community supervision;\
  \ Increase the number of supervision decisions that are fair and consistently applied,\
  \ and with consequences that are transparent; Promote and increase collaboration\
  \ among agencies and officials who work in community supervision, courts, law enforcement,\
  \ treatment, reentry, and related fields; Develop a plan to sustain effective SCF\
  \ supervision strategies and related collaborations beyond the award period; and,\
