    \ data on adult red drum and coastal shark species for assessment of their population\
    \ status in the coastal ocean and estuarine waters of South Carolina. \r\nThe\
    \ Great Lakes Commission provided institutional support for the Great Lakes Panel\
    \ and its committees assisting in the development, implementation, and coordination\
    \ of aquatic nuisance species program activities in the Great Lakes. The focus\
    \ of the Great Lakes Panel is building regional capacity for aquatic invasive\
    \ species (AIS) prevention and control, targeting potential new introductions\
    \ and established populations in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River ecosystem."
