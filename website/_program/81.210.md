objective: The objective of the Global Material Security Program is to enhance global
  security by working with partners worldwide to secure and prevent the smuggling
  of nuclear and radioactive materials and promote the development and deployment
  of secure nuclear technologies. For more than 25 years, the U.S. Department of Energy
  National Nuclear Security Administrationâ€™s (DOE/NNSA) Office of Global Material
  Security (GMS) has worked globally to secure and prevent the smuggling of radioactive
  and nuclear (R/N) materials. GMS plays a key role in implementing both the U.S.
  National Security Strategy and the National Security Memorandum (NSM-19) on countering
  weapons of mass destruction terrorism and advancing nuclear and radioactive material
  security worldwide. GMS works in the United States and across the globe with foreign
  partners to reduce the reliance on high-activity radioactive sources, remove and
  dispose of disused radioactive sources, secure and protect R/N materials in storage,
  use, and transit, and detect and investigate R/N material out of regulatory control.
