objective: To provide economic and other social science information and analysis for
  public and private decisions on agriculture, food, natural resources, and rural
  America. ERS produces such information for use by the general public and to help
  the executive and legislative branches develop, administer, and evaluate agricultural
  and rural policies and programs. The Research Innovation and Development Grants
  in Economics (RIDGE) Program encourages new and innovative research on food and
  nutrition assistance issues and broadens the participation of social science scholars
  in such research.
