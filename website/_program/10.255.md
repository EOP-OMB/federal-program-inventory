objective: To provide economic and other social science information and analysis for
  public and private decisions on agriculture, food, natural resources, and rural
  America. ERS produces such information for use by the general public and to help

  in Economics (RIDGE) Program encourages new and innovative research on food and
  nutrition assistance issues and broadens the participation of social science scholars
