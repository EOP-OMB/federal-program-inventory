objective: "The goals of this assistance listing are to (1) conduct site characterization\
  \ activities at potential or confirmed hazardous waste sites; (2) undertake response\
  \ planning and implementation actions at sites on the National Priorities List (NPL)\
  \ to clean up the hazardous waste sites that are found to pose hazards to human\
  \ health; and (3) effectively implement the statutory requirements of CERCLA 121(f)\
  \ which mandates substantial and meaningful State involvement. \n\nFunding Priorities\
  \ - Fiscal Year 2025:  Funding must be used at specific hazardous waste sites to:\
  \ (1) conduct non-time critical removal actions; (2) perform site characterization\
  \ activities such as preliminary assessments, site inspections, remedial investigations,\
  \ feasibility studies, and remedial design activities at potential or confirmed\
  \ hazardous waste sites; (3) conduct remedial actions (i.e., cleanup) at uncontrolled\
  \ hazardous waste sites as listed on the National Priorities List (NPL); (4) support\
  \ CERCLA implementation activities; (5) identify Potentially Responsible Parties\
  \ (PRPs); (6) conduct settlement negotiations; (7) take enforcement actions against\
  \ PRPs; and (8) oversee PRP cleanups."
