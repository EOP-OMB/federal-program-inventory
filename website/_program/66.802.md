  \ hazardous waste sites; (3) conduct remedial actions (i.e., cleanup) at uncontrolled\
  \ hazardous waste sites as listed on the National Priorities List (NPL); (4) support\

    cooperative agreements to lead cleanup actions, or to support EPA-lead cleanup
    actions, at hazardous waste sites. Cooperative agreements were awarded to lead
    the evaluation of newly discovered sites, to assess and investigate sites that
    have been identified as needing further action, to select, in partnership with
    EPA, the appropriate technologies and cleanup actions for these sites, to design
    the selected technologies and cleanup actions, and to construct the designed remedy.
    Funding was used to start or continue long term remedial actions to treat ground
    water where remediation goals have not yet been reached. Finally, funding was
    provided to meaningfully and substantially participate in cleanup actions where
    EPA led the cleanup. To date, in Fiscal Year 2016, 38 site-specific cooperative
    agreements were awarded. In Fiscal Year 2016, all EPA Regional Offices (except
