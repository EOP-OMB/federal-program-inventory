objective: "The FY 2023 Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) provides funding support\
  \ for physical security enhancements and other security-related activities to nonprofit\
  \ organizations that are at high risk of a terrorist or other extremist attack.\
  \ The FY 2023 NSGP seeks to integrate the preparedness activities of nonprofit organizations\
  \ with broader state and local preparedness efforts. There are two program types\
  \ under the appropriation: 1) Nonprofit Security Grant Program - Urban Area (NSGP-UA):\
  \ NSGP-UA funds nonprofit organizations located within Urban Area Security Initiative\
  \ (UASI)-designated urban areas. 2) Nonprofit Security Grant Program - State (NSGP-S):\
  \ Under NSGP-S, each state will receive a target allocation for nonprofit organizations\
  \ located outside of UASI-designated urban areas. \n\nThe objective of the FY 2023\
  \ NSGP is to provide funding for physical and\ncybersecurity enhancements and other\
  \ security-related activities to nonprofit\norganizations that are at high risk\
  \ of a terrorist or other extremist attack. The\nNSGP also seeks to integrate the\
  \ preparedness activities of nonprofit\norganizations with broader state and local\
  \ preparedness efforts.\n\n\n\nPerformance metrics for this program are:\n\n1.\t\
  Percentage of funding awarded for contract security;\n2.\tPercentage of funding\
  \ awarded for target hardening; and\n3.\tPercentage of funding awarded for training\
  \ and awareness campaigns.\n\nAmong the five basic homeland security missions noted\
