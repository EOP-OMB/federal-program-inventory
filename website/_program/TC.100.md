objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code was modified
  in 2009 to allow Indian tribal governments to issue tax exempt “tribal economic
  development bonds.” There is a national bond limitation of $2 billion on such bonds.
