objective: 'To provide technical and financial assistance to identify, conserve, manage,
  and enhance the natural, historical, and cultural resources and physical infrastructure
  of the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS); deliver public access and high-quality
  outdoor recreational opportunities; build a volunteer cadre, and inspire the next
  generation of hunters, anglers and wildlife enthusiasts through work on and off
  NWRS managed lands and waters.


  This program also encourages coordination and integration of efforts between U.S.
  Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) programs and interested parties to accomplish
  successful prevention or management of invasive species. Projects must conserve,
  protect, and enhance fish, wildlife and plants on and off NWRS managed lands for
  the continuing benefit of the American people.'
