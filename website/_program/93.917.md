    life-saving medications or assistance with health care coverage for 296,930 people
    with HIV in 2019 (an increase of 11,829 from the previous year). ADAPs have been
    successful in the efforts to engage and provide services to disproportionately
    impacted populations. Nearly three-quarters of ADAP clients are from racial/ethnic
    minority populations. In 2018, 39.1% of clients self-identified as Black/African
    American, 26.4% as Hispanic/Latino, and less than 2% each as Asian, American Indian/Alaska
    Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and people of multiple races.  More
    than half of female ADAP clients are Black/African American.  In addition, 43.5%
    of clients served by ADAPs have incomes below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level.
