objective: 'The Unaccompanied Children''s (UC) program provides for the care and placement
  of unaccompanied minors who are apprehended in the U.S. by Homeland Security agents,
  Border patrol agents, or other federal law enforcement agencies and are taken into
  care pending resolution of their claims for relief under U.S. immigration law or
  release to parent, adult family members, or another responsible adult. Resolution
  of their claims may result in release, granting of an immigration status (such as
  special immigrant juvenile or asylum), voluntary departure, or removal. The Office
  of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Division of Unaccompanied Children Operations (DUCO)
  has seven Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) under this program, which delineate
  the different types of care for Unaccompanied Children: Shelter and Transitional
  Foster Care (Shelter/TFC)-Licensed, Shelter and Transitional Foster Care (Shelter/TFC)-Prelicensed,
  Staff-Secure, Secure, Long-Term Foster Care (LTFC), Therapeutic Group Home, Residential
  Treatment Center, and Home Study and Post-Release Services.'

    already surpassing FY 15 annual total.  The program awarded new contracts for
    legal services which included funding for paid as well as probono representation
    of UC in and formerly in ORR custody.  The program has currently published six
    (6) Funding Opportunity Announcements  (FOA) for Residential shelter capacity
    and Post Release Services.  The program will increase monitoring of programs to

    (FOA) for Residential shelter capacity and Post Release Services for award in
    2017. The program will increase monitoring of programs to ensure compliance with
    regulations and policy and procedures. Fiscal Year 2017: The fluctuations underscore
    the unpredictable nature of referrals, which creates serious operational challenges
    if there is not a mechanism to provide additional resources, if needed. To accommodate
    the record number of referrals, ORR awarded 5 emergency shelter contracts to support
    the operations of temporary emergency shelters on federal land parcels to accommodate
    periods of influx of arrivals. '

- description: In FY 2024 the Program expects referral levels to match FY 2023. Referral
    levels are inherently unpredictable, and changes from FY2023 levels could affect
    funding amounts. The program anticipates posting and awarding NOFOs in FY 2024.
    The FY 2023 level reflects expansion of Post Release Services with three levels
    of services, expanded to include intensive and safety and well-being virtual check-ins.
