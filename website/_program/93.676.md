objective: 'The Unaccompanied Children''s (UC) program provides for the care and placement
  of unaccompanied minors who are apprehended in the U.S. by Homeland Security agents,
  Border patrol agents, or other federal law enforcement agencies and are taken into
  care pending resolution of their claims for relief under U.S. immigration law or
  release to parent, adult family members, or another responsible adult. Resolution
  of their claims may result in release, granting of an immigration status (such as
  special immigrant juvenile or asylum), voluntary departure, or removal. The Office
  of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Division of Unaccompanied Children Operations (DUCO)
  has seven Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) under this program, which delineate
  the different types of care for Unaccompanied Children: Shelter and Transitional
  Foster Care (Shelter/TFC)-Licensed, Shelter and Transitional Foster Care (Shelter/TFC)-Prelicensed,
  Staff-Secure, Secure, Long-Term Foster Care (LTFC), Therapeutic Group Home, Residential
  Treatment Center, and Home Study and Post-Release Services.'
