objective: The purpose of the Resettlement Support Centers (RSCs) is to assist the
  Bureau in preparing the necessary casework for persons eligible for interview by
  United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) of the Department of
  Homeland Security (DHS) under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and, for those
  approved, to provide assistance in completing the additional requirements for refugee
  admission under Section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In addition,
  the RSC forwards the necessary data on all DHS-approved cases to the Refugee Processing
  Center (RPC) for distribution to Reception and Placement agencies according to procedures
  established by the Bureau.
