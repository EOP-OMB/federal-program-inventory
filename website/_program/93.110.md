objective: "The Special Projects of Regional and National Significance Program (SPRANS)\
  \ carries out maternal and child health (MCH) projects to support training and research;\
  \ oral health integration; genetic disease testing, counseling, and information\
  \ development and dissemination programs; newborn screening for sickle cell anemia\
  \ and other genetic disorders; and comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic and treatment\
  \ centers.  \n \nThe Community Integrated Service Systems program works to develop\
  \ and expand home visitation; participation of obstetricians and pediatricians;\
  \ integrated service delivery systems; maternal and child health centers; services\
  \ for rural populations; and integrated state and community service systems for\
  \ children and youth with special health care needs.  \n \nThe Heritable Disorders\
  \ Program serves to improve the ability of States 1) to provide newborn and child\
  \ screening for heritable disorders and 2) to expand screenings as the capacity\
  \ to screen for genetic and congenital conditions expands. Newborn and child screenings\
  \ occur at intervals across the life span of every child. Newborn screening universally\
  \ provides early identification and follow-up for treatment of infants affected\
  \ by certain genetic, metabolic, hormonal and/or functional conditions. \n \nThe\
  \ Supporting Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Screening and Intervention program\
  \ trains primary care providers to reduce the incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure\
  \ and improve developmental outcomes in children with suspected or diagnosed FASDs.\
  \ The program reaches providers in states, territories, tribes, or communities that\
  \ have high rates of binge drinking among pregnant women, especially in rural areas.\
  \ \n\nThe Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders\
  \ (MMHSUD)  program helps address maternal mental health conditions that affect\
  \ women during and after pregnancy by expanding health care providers\u2019 capacity\
  \ to screen, assess, treat, and refer pregnant and postpartum people for maternal\
  \ depression and related behavioral disorders.\n \nThe Pediatric Mental Health Care\
  \ Access (PMHCA) program promotes behavioral health integration in pediatric primary\
  \ care by developing new or expanding existing statewide or regional pediatric mental\
  \ health care telehealth access programs that help these and other providers diagnose,\
  \ treat, and refer children with behavioral health conditions. PMHCA works to address\
  \ the shortages of psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, and other\
  \ behavioral health clinicians to support children and adolescents with behavioral\
  \ concerns.  \n\nThe Integrated Maternal Health Services program fosters the development\
  \ and demonstration of integrated maternal health services models, such as the Maternity\
  \ Medical Home, which is modeled after the patient-centered medical home. The models\
  \ developed and demonstrated support comprehensive care for pregnant and postpartum\
  \ people who experience health disparities and have limited access to basic social\
  \ and health care services. \n\nThe Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM)\
  \ program promotes safety and quality of care during and immediately after childbirth\
  \ and addresses the high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the U.S. It\
  \ is the national, cross-sector commitment designed to lead in the identification,\
  \ development, implementation, and dissemination of maternal (patient) safety bundles\
  \ for the promotion of safe care for every U.S. birth. The AIM Technical Assistance\
  \ Center supports all entities participating in the AIM program to increase birthing\
  \ facility engagement, support bundle implementation and sustainability, manage\
  \ reporting and analysis of state AIM data, and promote safe care for pregnant and\
  \ postpartum people. \n\nThe purpose of State Maternal Health Innovation program\
  \ is to reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity by supporting state-led\
  \ demonstrations focused on improving maternal health and addressing maternal health\
  \ disparities through quality services, a skilled workforce, enhanced data quality\
  \ and capacity, and innovative programming.  \nThe MCH Research Portfolio includes\
  \ the MCH Research Network (MCH RN), MCH Field-Initiated Innovative Research Studies\
  \ (MCH FIRST), and MCH Secondary Data Analysis (MCH SDAR) Programs. MCH RNs focus\
  \ on collaborative, interdisciplinary, multisite research forums and dissemination\
  \ of information to build infrastructure. The networks provide national leadership\
  \ in research to advance the evidence base on effective interventions for mothers,\
  \ children, and families. The MCH FIRST and MCH SDAR Programs support investigator-initiated\
  \ applied MCH research that has the potential to improve health care services and\
  \ delivery, and to promote the health and wellbeing of maternal and child populations.\
  \ MCH FIRST grants involve the collection of original data. MCH SDAR grants focus\
  \ exclusively on secondary analyses of existing national or other large-scale data\
  \ sets."
