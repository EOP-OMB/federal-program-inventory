objective: "The Special Projects of Regional and National Significance Program (SPRANS)\
  \ carries out maternal and child health (MCH) projects to support training and research;\
  \ oral health integration; genetic disease testing, counseling, and information\
  \ development and dissemination programs; newborn screening for sickle cell anemia\
  \ and other genetic disorders; and comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic and treatment\
  \ centers.  \n \nThe Community Integrated Service Systems program works to develop\
  \ and expand home visitation; participation of obstetricians and pediatricians;\
  \ integrated service delivery systems; maternal and child health centers; services\
  \ for rural populations; and integrated state and community service systems for\
  \ children and youth with special health care needs.  \n \nThe Heritable Disorders\
  \ Program serves to improve the ability of States 1) to provide newborn and child\
  \ screening for heritable disorders and 2) to expand screenings as the capacity\
  \ to screen for genetic and congenital conditions expands. Newborn and child screenings\
  \ occur at intervals across the life span of every child. Newborn screening universally\
  \ provides early identification and follow-up for treatment of infants affected\
  \ by certain genetic, metabolic, hormonal and/or functional conditions. \n \nThe\
  \ Supporting Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Screening and Intervention program\
  \ trains primary care providers to reduce the incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure\
  \ and improve developmental outcomes in children with suspected or diagnosed FASDs.\
  \ The program reaches providers in states, territories, tribes, or communities that\
  \ have high rates of binge drinking among pregnant women, especially in rural areas.\
  \ \n\nThe Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders\
  \ (MMHSUD)  program helps address maternal mental health conditions that affect\
  \ women during and after pregnancy by expanding health care providers’ capacity\
  \ to screen, assess, treat, and refer pregnant and postpartum people for maternal\
  \ depression and related behavioral disorders.\n \nThe Pediatric Mental Health Care\
  \ Access (PMHCA) program promotes behavioral health integration in pediatric primary\
  \ care by developing new or expanding existing statewide or regional pediatric mental\
  \ health care telehealth access programs that help these and other providers diagnose,\
  \ treat, and refer children with behavioral health conditions. PMHCA works to address\
  \ the shortages of psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, and other\
  \ behavioral health clinicians to support children and adolescents with behavioral\
  \ concerns.  \n\nThe Integrated Maternal Health Services program fosters the development\
  \ and demonstration of integrated maternal health services models, such as the Maternity\
  \ Medical Home, which is modeled after the patient-centered medical home. The models\
  \ developed and demonstrated support comprehensive care for pregnant and postpartum\
  \ people who experience health disparities and have limited access to basic social\
  \ and health care services. \n\nThe Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM)\
  \ program promotes safety and quality of care during and immediately after childbirth\
  \ and addresses the high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the U.S. It\
  \ is the national, cross-sector commitment designed to lead in the identification,\
  \ development, implementation, and dissemination of maternal (patient) safety bundles\
  \ for the promotion of safe care for every U.S. birth. The AIM Technical Assistance\
  \ Center supports all entities participating in the AIM program to increase birthing\
  \ facility engagement, support bundle implementation and sustainability, manage\
  \ reporting and analysis of state AIM data, and promote safe care for pregnant and\
  \ postpartum people. \n\nThe purpose of State Maternal Health Innovation program\
  \ is to reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity by supporting state-led\
  \ demonstrations focused on improving maternal health and addressing maternal health\
  \ disparities through quality services, a skilled workforce, enhanced data quality\
  \ and capacity, and innovative programming.  \nThe MCH Research Portfolio includes\
  \ the MCH Research Network (MCH RN), MCH Field-Initiated Innovative Research Studies\
  \ (MCH FIRST), and MCH Secondary Data Analysis (MCH SDAR) Programs. MCH RNs focus\
  \ on collaborative, interdisciplinary, multisite research forums and dissemination\
  \ of information to build infrastructure. The networks provide national leadership\
  \ in research to advance the evidence base on effective interventions for mothers,\
  \ children, and families. The MCH FIRST and MCH SDAR Programs support investigator-initiated\
  \ applied MCH research that has the potential to improve health care services and\
  \ delivery, and to promote the health and wellbeing of maternal and child populations.\
  \ MCH FIRST grants involve the collection of original data. MCH SDAR grants focus\
  \ exclusively on secondary analyses of existing national or other large-scale data\
  \ sets."

- description: "In FY 2019, the Leadership Education in Adolescent Health (LEAH) program\
    \ provided interdisciplinary leadership training to 2,197 health and related professionals\
    \ at the graduate and postgraduate levels; enhanced the knowledge and skills of\
    \ nearly 30,000 practicing professionals through the provision of 538 continuing\
    \ education events; and strengthened the capacity of Title V and other MCH partners\
    \ through 650 technical assistance activities to 136,660 recipients in local,\
    \ state, and community entities.   \nIn FY 2020, the Strengthen the Evidence in\
    \ Maternal and Child Health Program provided 44 technical assistance (TA) sessions\
    \ to states and jurisdictions, including several regional TA sessions, topic-specific\
    \ TA, and TA to all Pacific Basin and Atlantic jurisdictions; worked extensively\
    \ with a team of expert reviewers to publish two Evidence Analysis Reports, for\
    \ updates of National Performance Measure (NPM) Online Toolkits, and for TA requests;\
    \ engaged 16 experts in the webinar development of evidence-based, informed strategies\
    \ for the 15 Title V national performance measures, made available to all Title\
    \ V states and jurisdictions’.\nThe heritable disorders program has supported\
    \ the widespread adoption of SCID newborn screening since 2014. In 2012, only\
    \ six states screened for SCID. By 2018, all 50 states and 3 U.S. territories\
    \ screen for SCID. Despite the success of broad SCID newborn screening, gaps remain\
    \ in optimizing outcomes for infants with SCID that is detected by newborn screening.\
    \ Additionally, almost 50% of states have implemented the four new conditions\
    \ (Pompe [2015], X-ALD [2016], MPS I [2016], and SMA [2018]) added to the recommended\
    \ screening panel since 2015."

- description: 'The Heritable Disorders Program has supported the widespread adoption
    of newborn screening since 2008. For example, in 2012, only six states screened
    for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). By 2018, all 50 states and 3 U.S.
    territories screen for SCID. Additionally, more than 50% of states have implemented
    four new conditions added to the recommended screening panel since 2013, including
    Pompe disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I, and
    Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

    Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression and Related Behavioral Disorders
    programs improved short- and intermediate-term outcomes in training, consultation,
    and screening services. Awardees trained 1,085 providers in FY 2020, an increase
    from 160 providers trained in FY 2019. Providers received expert consultation
    for 7,448 pregnant and postpartum women in FY 2020, of which 47% lived in rural/underserved
    areas, an increase from 233 pregnant and postpartum women in FY 2019, of which
    30% lived in rural/underserved areas. The number of pregnant and postpartum women
    screened for depression by participating providers increased from 4,053 in FY
    2019 to 24,518 in FY 2021.


    In FY 2021, the Supporting Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Screening and Intervention
    Program enrolled 10 prenatal and 12 pediatric practices within 14 health centers
    in seven states in their 10-month Project Echo training program. Five of the enrolled
    health centers serve rural, 9 serve urban, and 3 serve tribal communities. At
    the mid-point survey, a high proportion of participants reported: increased knowledge
    about screening for Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) both during pregnancy and
    among children with possible FASD; improved self-efficacy to screen for PAE and
    counsel families about both PAE and FASD; and increased practice of screening
    for, and counseling patients with alcohol use during pregnancy and screening for
    PAE among children with suspected FASD.'

    \ 40 out of 53 state newborn screening programs screen for 90% or more of the\
    \ core conditions on the RUSP.\n. \nThe MMHSUD program improved short- and intermediate-term\
    \ outcomes in training, consultation, and screening services. Awardees trained\
    \ 1,875 providers in FY 2022 compared to 782 in FY 2021. The number of providers\
    \ using the MMHSUD program for consultation and care coordination support services\
    \ for treatment and referral of pregnant and postpartum women with behavioral\
    \ health conditions increased from 584 in FY 2021 to 824 in FY 2022. \n \nIn FY\
    \ 2022, the FASD Screening and Intervention program completed their first learning\
    \ collaborative cohort which included 10 prenatal and 12 pediatric practices within\
    \ 14 health centers in 7 states. The program also enrolled their second cohort\
    \ which included 11 prenatal and 11 pediatric practices within 16 health centers\
    \ in seven states. The combined cohorts included health centers serving 9 rural,\
    \ 21 urban, and 7 tribal communities. Participants from the first cohort reported\
    \ increased knowledge about screening for Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) both\
    \ during pregnancy and among children with possible FASD; improved self-efficacy\
    \ to screen for PAE and counsel families about both PAE and FASD; and increased\
    \ practice of screening for, and counseling patients with alcohol use during pregnancy\
    \ and screening for PAE among children with suspected FASD. \n \nBirthing facilities\
    \ in all 50 states and D.C. are implementing AIM patient safety bundles (PSBs).\

    \ in AIM. \n•\t25 states engaged in widespread implementation of AIM PSBs \n•\t\
    7 states are implementing targeted quality improvement projects \n•\t29 states\
    \ implementing the Obstetric Hemorrhage bundle \n•\t34 implementing the Severe\
    \ Hypertension in Pregnancy bundle, and \n•\t27 states implementing the Care for\
    \ Pregnant and Postpartum People with Substance Use Disorder bundle.   \nIn June\
    \ 2023, AIM launched the Obstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit, for use by\
    \ teams in healthcare settings that may not typically provide obstetric services\
    \ or frequently care for people experiencing obstetric emergencies. \n \nSince\
    \ 2019, the State Maternal Health Innovation awardees have established Maternal\
    \ Health Task Forces that regularly convene multidisciplinary stakeholders; created\
    \ and are implementing a strategic plan that incorporates activities from the\
    \ state’s most recent Title V Needs Assessment; and reported state-level data\
    \ surveillance on maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity for three years\
