objective: "The Special Projects of Regional and National Significance Program (SPRANS)\
  \ carries out maternal and child health (MCH) projects to support training and research;\
  \ oral health integration; genetic disease testing, counseling, and information\
  \ development and dissemination programs; newborn screening for sickle cell anemia\
  \ and other genetic disorders; and comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic and treatment\
  \ centers.  \n \nThe Community Integrated Service Systems program works to develop\
  \ and expand home visitation; participation of obstetricians and pediatricians;\
  \ integrated service delivery systems; maternal and child health centers; services\
  \ for rural populations; and integrated state and community service systems for\
  \ children and youth with special health care needs.  \n \nThe Heritable Disorders\
  \ Program serves to improve the ability of States 1) to provide newborn and child\
  \ screening for heritable disorders and 2) to expand screenings as the capacity\
  \ to screen for genetic and congenital conditions expands. Newborn and child screenings\
  \ occur at intervals across the life span of every child. Newborn screening universally\
  \ provides early identification and follow-up for treatment of infants affected\
  \ by certain genetic, metabolic, hormonal and/or functional conditions. \n \nThe\
  \ Supporting Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Screening and Intervention program\
  \ trains primary care providers to reduce the incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure\
  \ and improve developmental outcomes in children with suspected or diagnosed FASDs.\
  \ The program reaches providers in states, territories, tribes, or communities that\
  \ have high rates of binge drinking among pregnant women, especially in rural areas.\
  \ \n\nThe Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders\
  \ (MMHSUD)  program helps address maternal mental health conditions that affect\
  \ women during and after pregnancy by expanding health care providers\u2019 capacity\
  \ to screen, assess, treat, and refer pregnant and postpartum people for maternal\
  \ depression and related behavioral disorders.\n \nThe Pediatric Mental Health Care\
  \ Access (PMHCA) program promotes behavioral health integration in pediatric primary\
  \ care by developing new or expanding existing statewide or regional pediatric mental\
  \ health care telehealth access programs that help these and other providers diagnose,\
  \ treat, and refer children with behavioral health conditions. PMHCA works to address\
  \ the shortages of psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, and other\
  \ behavioral health clinicians to support children and adolescents with behavioral\
  \ concerns.  \n\nThe Integrated Maternal Health Services program fosters the development\
  \ and demonstration of integrated maternal health services models, such as the Maternity\
  \ Medical Home, which is modeled after the patient-centered medical home. The models\
  \ developed and demonstrated support comprehensive care for pregnant and postpartum\
  \ people who experience health disparities and have limited access to basic social\
  \ and health care services. \n\nThe Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM)\
  \ program promotes safety and quality of care during and immediately after childbirth\
  \ and addresses the high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the U.S. It\
  \ is the national, cross-sector commitment designed to lead in the identification,\
  \ development, implementation, and dissemination of maternal (patient) safety bundles\
  \ for the promotion of safe care for every U.S. birth. The AIM Technical Assistance\
  \ Center supports all entities participating in the AIM program to increase birthing\
  \ facility engagement, support bundle implementation and sustainability, manage\
  \ reporting and analysis of state AIM data, and promote safe care for pregnant and\
  \ postpartum people. \n\nThe purpose of State Maternal Health Innovation program\
  \ is to reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity by supporting state-led\
  \ demonstrations focused on improving maternal health and addressing maternal health\
  \ disparities through quality services, a skilled workforce, enhanced data quality\
  \ and capacity, and innovative programming.  \nThe MCH Research Portfolio includes\
  \ the MCH Research Network (MCH RN), MCH Field-Initiated Innovative Research Studies\
  \ (MCH FIRST), and MCH Secondary Data Analysis (MCH SDAR) Programs. MCH RNs focus\
  \ on collaborative, interdisciplinary, multisite research forums and dissemination\
  \ of information to build infrastructure. The networks provide national leadership\
  \ in research to advance the evidence base on effective interventions for mothers,\
  \ children, and families. The MCH FIRST and MCH SDAR Programs support investigator-initiated\
  \ applied MCH research that has the potential to improve health care services and\
  \ delivery, and to promote the health and wellbeing of maternal and child populations.\
  \ MCH FIRST grants involve the collection of original data. MCH SDAR grants focus\
  \ exclusively on secondary analyses of existing national or other large-scale data\
  \ sets."

results:
- description: "The Heritable Disorders Program has supported the widespread adoption\
    \ of newborn screening since 2008. For example, in 2012, only six states screened\
    \ for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). By 2018, all 50 states and 3 U.S.\
    \ territories screen for SCID. Currently, all states screen for at least 31 core\
    \ conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). Across the U.S.,\
    \ 40 out of 53 state newborn screening programs screen for 90% or more of the\
    \ core conditions on the RUSP.\n. \nThe MMHSUD program improved short- and intermediate-term\
    \ outcomes in training, consultation, and screening services. Awardees trained\
    \ 1,875 providers in FY 2022 compared to 782 in FY 2021. The number of providers\
    \ using the MMHSUD program for consultation and care coordination support services\
    \ for treatment and referral of pregnant and postpartum women with behavioral\
    \ health conditions increased from 584 in FY 2021 to 824 in FY 2022. \n \nIn FY\
    \ 2022, the FASD Screening and Intervention program completed their first learning\
    \ collaborative cohort which included 10 prenatal and 12 pediatric practices within\
    \ 14 health centers in 7 states. The program also enrolled their second cohort\
    \ which included 11 prenatal and 11 pediatric practices within 16 health centers\
    \ in seven states. The combined cohorts included health centers serving 9 rural,\
    \ 21 urban, and 7 tribal communities. Participants from the first cohort reported\
    \ increased knowledge about screening for Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) both\
    \ during pregnancy and among children with possible FASD; improved self-efficacy\
    \ to screen for PAE and counsel families about both PAE and FASD; and increased\
    \ practice of screening for, and counseling patients with alcohol use during pregnancy\
    \ and screening for PAE among children with suspected FASD. \n \nBirthing facilities\
    \ in all 50 states and D.C. are implementing AIM patient safety bundles (PSBs).\
    \ As of February 2023, there are: \n\u2022\t1,917 birthing facilities participating\
    \ in AIM. \n\u2022\t25 states engaged in widespread implementation of AIM PSBs\
    \ \n\u2022\t7 states are implementing targeted quality improvement projects \n\
    \u2022\t29 states implementing the Obstetric Hemorrhage bundle \n\u2022\t34 implementing\
    \ the Severe Hypertension in Pregnancy bundle, and \n\u2022\t27 states implementing\
    \ the Care for Pregnant and Postpartum People with Substance Use Disorder bundle.\
    \   \nIn June 2023, AIM launched the Obstetric Emergency Readiness Resource Kit,\
    \ for use by teams in healthcare settings that may not typically provide obstetric\
    \ services or frequently care for people experiencing obstetric emergencies. \n\
    \ \nSince 2019, the State Maternal Health Innovation awardees have established\
    \ Maternal Health Task Forces that regularly convene multidisciplinary stakeholders;\
    \ created and are implementing a strategic plan that incorporates activities from\
    \ the state\u2019s most recent Title V Needs Assessment; and reported state-level\
    \ data surveillance on maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity for three\
    \ years in their Maternal Health Annual Reports. \n \nAcross 21 states in FY 2021,\
    \ the PMHCA program achieved the following:  \n\u2022\tOver 6,700 primary care\
    \ providers enrolled in a statewide or regional PMHCA program. \n\u2022\tOver\
    \ 2,000 providers used consultation and care coordination support services\n\u2022\
    \tOver 8,200 children and adolescents were served by Pediatric primary care providers\
    \ who contacted the pediatric mental health team. \n  \nAccomplishments from the\
    \ MCH Research Networks in FY 2021 include: \n\u2022\tCompleted 104 studies on\
    \ a broad range of maternal, child, and family health topics \n\u2022\tEnrolled\
    \ 13,998 participants in primary research studies across 475 research sites across\
    \ the country, and included 2,822,373 participants in secondary data analyses\
    \ \n\u2022\tPublished 75 peer-reviewed manuscripts in leading scholarly journals"
