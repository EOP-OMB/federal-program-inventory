    state pipeline safety programs by helping states implement the nine elements of
    an effective damage prevention program detailed in 49 U.S.C. § 60134(b). The nine
    elements address various aspects of excavation damage prevention, including, but
    not limited to: enforcement of the state one-call law, public education, and data
    collection and analysis. PHMSA received 20 eligible applications requesting total
    funding of $1,821,742. The available SDP grant funding for FY 2022 is $1,663,516.  To
    utilize all available funding and ensure fair and consistent treatment of all
    projects recommended for award, PHMSA recommends that funding be distributed on
    a pro rata basis. Each project rated “Highly Recommended” will be funded at approximately
    94 percent of the requested amount and each project rated “Acceptable” will be
    funded at approximately 71 percent of the requested amount. No applications received
    “Recommended” or “Unacceptable” ratings.'
