objective: To provide a community-based program designed to meet the needs of adults
  with impairments through individual plans of care. This type of structured, comprehensive,
  nonresidential program provides a variety of health, social, and related support
  services in a protective setting. By supporting families and caregivers, an adult

  program assesses the needs of the persons served and offers services to meet those
  needs. The persons served attend on a planned basis. Nothing in this generic description
  of adult day services may be construed to modify the specific services or eligibility
  requirements referenced in the definition of adult day care and adult day health.
