objective: 'The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, 42 U.S.C. 16131 et seq., as amended,
  authorizes EPA to award assistance agreements to states and territories to develop
  and implement such grant, rebates, and loan programs in the states and territories
  as are appropriate to meet state and territory needs and goals relating to the reduction
  of diesel emissions.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  In providing grants, rebates, and loans
  under this program, states must give priority to projects which: maximize public
  health benefits; are the most cost-effective; serve areas with the highest population
  density, that are poor air quality areas (including nonattainment or maintenance
  of national ambient air quality standards for a criteria pollutant; Federal Class
  I areas; or areas with toxic air pollutant concerns); serve areas that receive a
  disproportionate quantity of air pollution from diesel fleets, including truck stops,
  ports, rail yards, terminals, construction sites, schools, and distribution centers
  or that use a community-based multi-stakeholder collaborative process to reduce
  toxic emissions; will only include a certified engine configuration or verified
  technology that has a long expected useful life; maximize the useful life of any
  certified engine configuration or verified technology used or funded by the eligible
  entity; and conserve diesel fuel.'
