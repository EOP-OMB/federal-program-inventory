objective: 'The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, 42 U.S.C. 16131 et seq., as amended,
  authorizes EPA to award assistance agreements to states and territories to develop
  and implement such grant, rebates, and loan programs in the states and territories
  as are appropriate to meet state and territory needs and goals relating to the reduction
  of diesel emissions.


  In providing grants, rebates, and loans under this program, states must give priority
  to projects which: maximize public health benefits; are the most cost-effective;
  serve areas with the highest population density, that are poor air quality areas
  (including nonattainment or maintenance of national ambient air quality standards
  for a criteria pollutant; Federal Class I areas; or areas with toxic air pollutant
  concerns); serve areas that receive a disproportionate quantity of air pollution
  from diesel fleets, including truck stops, ports, rail yards, terminals, construction
  sites, schools, and distribution centers or that use a community-based multi-stakeholder
  collaborative process to reduce toxic emissions; will only include a certified engine
  configuration or verified technology that has a long expected useful life; maximize
  the useful life of any certified engine configuration or verified technology used
  or funded by the eligible entity; and conserve diesel fuel.'
