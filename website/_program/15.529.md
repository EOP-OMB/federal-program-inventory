- description: Information not available. The Upper Colorado River and San Juan River
    Endangered Fish Recovery Programs (Recovery Programs) are partnerships composed
    of State, Tribal and Federal agencies, water and power interests, and environmental
    groups working to recover endangered fish in the Upper Colorado and San Juan River
    basins while water development proceeds in accordance with federal and state laws
    and interstate compacts.  In Fiscal Year 2016 and 2017, the Recovery Programs
    continued to provide ESA coverage to thousands of state, federal and private water
    development projects while advancing endangered fish recovery.  The programs implemented
    management actions and projects to recover endangered fish in the areas of in-stream
    flow protection, habitat restoration, nonnative fish management, propagation and
    genetics, research and monitoring, information and education, and program management.  Specific
    examples include operation and maintenance of river gages and infrastructure (fish
    passages and screens), installation of and maintenance of electronic fish monitoring
    antennae, coordination of reservoir operations, management of floodplain wetland
    rearing habitats including stocking of endangered fish in managed wetlands, removal
    of and translocation of nonnative fish, propagation and stocking of endangered
    fish, planning for pond construction, research and monitoring of early life history
    endangered fish survival including larval fish monitoring, database management,
    population estimates, maintenance of program website and publication of outreach
    materials.

    to thousands of state, federal and private water development projects while advancing
    endangered fish recovery.  Proposals to downlist two of the four endangered fish
    species are currently working their way through US Fish and Wildlife Service regulatory
    channels.  The programs implemented management actions and projects to recover
    endangered fish in the areas of in-stream flow protection, habitat restoration,
    nonnative fish management, propagation and genetics, research and monitoring,

    Programs (Recovery Programs) are partnerships composed of State, Tribal and Federal
    agencies, water and power interests, and environmental groups working to recover
    endangered fish in the Upper Colorado and San Juan River basins while water development
    proceeds in accordance with federal and state laws and interstate compacts.  In
    Fiscal Year 2019 and 2020, the Recovery Programs continued to provide ESA coverage
    to over 2,500 of state, federal and private water development projects while advancing
    endangered fish recovery.  Proposals to downlist two of the four endangered fish
    species and associated rulemaking notices are currently working their way through
    US Fish and Wildlife Service regulatory channels.  The programs implemented management
    actions and projects to recover endangered fish in the areas of in-stream flow
    protection, habitat restoration, nonnative fish management, propagation and genetics,
    research and monitoring, information and education, and program management.  Specific
    examples include operation and maintenance of river flow gages and infrastructure
    (fish passages, and screens), installation of and maintenance of electronic fish
    monitoring systems, maintenance of online databases, coordination of reservoir
    operations for recovery of endangered fish, completion of a small student-run
    fish hatchery at Palisade High School, Palisade, CO, management of floodplain
    wetland rearing habitats including stocking of endangered fish in managed wetlands,
    removal of and translocation of nonnative fish, collection of juvenile endangered
    fish for broodstock development, propagation and stocking of endangered fish,
    planning for pond construction, research and monitoring of early life history
    endangered fish survival including larval fish monitoring, database management,
    population estimates, maintenance of program website and publication and distribution

    to over 2,500 of state, federal and private water development projects while advancing
    endangered fish recovery. One of the four ESA-listed fish species was downlisted
    from “endangered” status to “threatened” status during this time period, and another
    is proposed for downlisting, which are significant advancements for these programs.
    The programs implemented management actions and projects to recover endangered
    fish in the areas of in-stream flow protection, habitat restoration, nonnative
    fish management, propagation and genetics, research and monitoring, information
