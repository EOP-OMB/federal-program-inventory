- description: "The Upper Colorado River and San Juan River Endangered Fish Recovery\
    \ Programs (Recovery Programs) are partnerships composed of State, Tribal and\
    \ Federal agencies, water and power interests, and environmental groups working\
    \ to recover endangered fish in the Upper Colorado and San Juan River basins while\
    \ water development proceeds in accordance with federal and state laws and interstate\
    \ compacts. In Fiscal Year 2021 and 2022, the Recovery Programs continued to provide\
    \ ESA coverage to over 2,500 of state, federal and private water development projects\
    \ while advancing endangered fish recovery. One of the four ESA-listed fish species\
    \ was downlisted from \u201Cendangered\u201D status to \u201Cthreatened\u201D\
    \ status during this time period, and another is proposed for downlisting, which\
    \ are significant advancements for these programs. The programs implemented management\
    \ actions and projects to recover endangered fish in the areas of in-stream flow\
    \ protection, habitat restoration, nonnative fish management, propagation and\
    \ genetics, research and monitoring, information and education, and program management.\
    \ Specific examples include operation and maintenance of river flow gages and\
    \ infrastructure (fish passages, and screens), installation of and maintenance\
    \ of electronic fish monitoring systems, maintenance of online databases, coordination\
    \ of reservoir operations for recovery of endangered fish, completion of a small\
    \ student-run fish hatchery at Palisade High School, Palisade, CO, management\
    \ of floodplain wetland rearing habitats including stocking of endangered fish\
    \ in managed wetlands, removal nonnative fish, collection of juvenile endangered\
    \ fish for broodstock development, completion of a spillway fish screen on Ridgeway\
    \ Reservoir, CO, completion of a water control structure at Stirrup Bottom (Green\
    \ River), propagation and stocking of endangered fish, planning for pond construction,\
    \ research and monitoring of early life history endangered fish survival including\
    \ larval fish monitoring, database management, population estimates, maintenance\
    \ of program website and publication and distribution of outreach materials."
