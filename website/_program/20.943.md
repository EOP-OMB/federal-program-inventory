objective: The intent of this Program is to advance transportation infrastructure
  projects in rural and tribal communities by supporting development-phase activities
  for projects reasonably expected to be eligible for certain DOT credit and grant
  programs. Grants fund financial, technical, and legal assistance to states and rural
  and tribal communities. The grants are intended to augment organizational capacity
  in communities that may not have resources available to evaluate and develop projects
  that qualify for federal funding and financing programs.
