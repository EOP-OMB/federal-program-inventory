objective: "The climate and transportation research center shall advance the following\
  \ research and technology goals: (1) support decarbonization of the transportation\
  \ sector; (2) build resilience of transportation infrastructure, networks, and operations;\
  \ (3) address climate and environmental injustices related to transportation; and\
  \ (4) otherwise advance understanding of solutions to the nation’s climate change\
  \ and transportation challenges. \nPriority research and technology development\
  \ topics with high potential to serve these goals include, but are not limited to,\
  \ the following: \n•\tData and tools to reduce trips and shift trips to climate-friendly\
  \ vehicles and modes, including shift to electric vehicles, transit, micromobility\
  \ services, and active transport, combined with integrated transportation and land-use\
  \ planning, including transit-oriented development, such that people are less dependent\
  \ on personal vehicles and more likely to walk, bike, or use transit.\n•\tTransformative\
  \ approaches to understanding, predicting, and addressing via technology, design,\
  \ behavior, and policy interventions, the induced demand and associated greenhouse\
  \ gas emissions from roadway improvement projects. Methods for better incorporating\
  \ induced demand into travel demand models. Evidence-based approaches and tools\
  \ for decision makers for assessing the greenhouse gas emissions effects of transportation\
  \ investments, policies, and practices. \n•\tCutting-edge technologies that have\
  \ the potential to leverage the climate-tech industry to transform the United States\
  \ to be a world leader in sustainable transportation, such as innovations in data-driven\
  \ insights, automation, and integrated system-of-systems that significantly reduce\
  \ greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.\n•\tInnovative applications of social\
  \ and behavioral sciences for transportation demand management and other policy\
  \ interventions that support lower-carbon consumer transportation choices, mode\
  \ shift, seamless modal connectivity, and reductions in transportation greenhouse\
  \ gas emissions overall. Research supporting state and local governments considering\
  \ policy options to realign consumer incentives and disincentives to encourage lower-carbon\
  \ consumer choices.\n•\tInnovative use of new and emerging environmental sensors\
  \ to support the assessment and early detection of pollutants, helping public agencies\
  \ reduce climate and environmental impacts and transportation and respond to environmental\
  \ emergencies, and integration of such analyses into climate and environmental justice\
  \ policy decisions.\n•\tThe development and deployment of methods to assess and\
  \ reduce the risks to transportation system performance posed by climate change\
  \ and related natural hazards that are exacerbated by climate change (e.g., extreme\
  \ heat, pluvial flooding, slope stability concerns, permafrost thaw) Incorporation\
  \ of nature-based solutions. Research and deployment of innovative resilient infrastructure,\
  \ networks, and operations, especially in underserved and overburdened communities\
  \ and communities with environmental justice concerns.\n•\tInnovative adaptation\
  \ strategies and standards for the new resilient transportation networks that will\
  \ be needed in vulnerable areas and for climate-driven relocation, such as new passenger\
  \ rail lines and resilient access for coastal locations (e.g., transition from surface\
  \ roads to waterways, elevated transportation corridors, alternate road surfaces\
  \ that are environmentally friendly if damaged and can be rapidly repaired).\n•\t\
  Innovative research on policy solutions to tackle challenges around deployment of\
  \ transportation decarbonization technologies at the local level, such as research\
  \ on balancing priorities the need for rapid deployment and adoption while centering\
  \ underserved communities and prioritizing community engagement.\n•\tOther innovative\
  \ approaches proposed by applicants that have the potential to solve climate and\
  \ sustainability challenges within the U.S. transportation sector. \n\nIn concert\
  \ with U.S. DOT, the climate and transportation research center shall publish and\
  \ release research results and tools that empower communities, state and local governments,\
  \ metropolitan planning organizations, and commercial operators to make informed\
  \ decisions on climate change and environmental justice."
