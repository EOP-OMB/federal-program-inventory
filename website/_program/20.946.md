objective: "The climate and transportation research center shall advance the following\
  \ research and technology goals: (1) support decarbonization of the transportation\
  \ sector; (2) build resilience of transportation infrastructure, networks, and operations;\
  \ (3) address climate and environmental injustices related to transportation; and\
  \ (4) otherwise advance understanding of solutions to the nation\u2019s climate\
  \ change and transportation challenges. \nPriority research and technology development\
  \ topics with high potential to serve these goals include, but are not limited to,\
  \ the following: \n\u2022\tData and tools to reduce trips and shift trips to climate-friendly\
  \ vehicles and modes, including shift to electric vehicles, transit, micromobility\
  \ services, and active transport, combined with integrated transportation and land-use\
  \ planning, including transit-oriented development, such that people are less dependent\
  \ on personal vehicles and more likely to walk, bike, or use transit.\n\u2022\t\
  Transformative approaches to understanding, predicting, and addressing via technology,\
  \ design, behavior, and policy interventions, the induced demand and associated\
  \ greenhouse gas emissions from roadway improvement projects. Methods for better\
  \ incorporating induced demand into travel demand models. Evidence-based approaches\
  \ and tools for decision makers for assessing the greenhouse gas emissions effects\
  \ of transportation investments, policies, and practices. \n\u2022\tCutting-edge\
  \ technologies that have the potential to leverage the climate-tech industry to\
  \ transform the United States to be a world leader in sustainable transportation,\
  \ such as innovations in data-driven insights, automation, and integrated system-of-systems\
  \ that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.\n\u2022\
  \tInnovative applications of social and behavioral sciences for transportation demand\
  \ management and other policy interventions that support lower-carbon consumer transportation\
  \ choices, mode shift, seamless modal connectivity, and reductions in transportation\
  \ greenhouse gas emissions overall. Research supporting state and local governments\
  \ considering policy options to realign consumer incentives and disincentives to\
  \ encourage lower-carbon consumer choices.\n\u2022\tInnovative use of new and emerging\
  \ environmental sensors to support the assessment and early detection of pollutants,\
  \ helping public agencies reduce climate and environmental impacts and transportation\
  \ and respond to environmental emergencies, and integration of such analyses into\
  \ climate and environmental justice policy decisions.\n\u2022\tThe development and\
  \ deployment of methods to assess and reduce the risks to transportation system\
  \ performance posed by climate change and related natural hazards that are exacerbated\
  \ by climate change (e.g., extreme heat, pluvial flooding, slope stability concerns,\
  \ permafrost thaw) Incorporation of nature-based solutions. Research and deployment\
  \ of innovative resilient infrastructure, networks, and operations, especially in\
  \ underserved and overburdened communities and communities with environmental justice\
  \ concerns.\n\u2022\tInnovative adaptation strategies and standards for the new\
  \ resilient transportation networks that will be needed in vulnerable areas and\
  \ for climate-driven relocation, such as new passenger rail lines and resilient\
  \ access for coastal locations (e.g., transition from surface roads to waterways,\
  \ elevated transportation corridors, alternate road surfaces that are environmentally\
  \ friendly if damaged and can be rapidly repaired).\n\u2022\tInnovative research\
  \ on policy solutions to tackle challenges around deployment of transportation decarbonization\
  \ technologies at the local level, such as research on balancing priorities the\
  \ need for rapid deployment and adoption while centering underserved communities\
  \ and prioritizing community engagement.\n\u2022\tOther innovative approaches proposed\
  \ by applicants that have the potential to solve climate and sustainability challenges\
  \ within the U.S. transportation sector. \n\nIn concert with U.S. DOT, the climate\
  \ and transportation research center shall publish and release research results\
  \ and tools that empower communities, state and local governments, metropolitan\
  \ planning organizations, and commercial operators to make informed decisions on\
  \ climate change and environmental justice."
