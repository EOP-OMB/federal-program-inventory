objective: Under a comprehensive economic income tax, the costs of acquiring a building
  are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the
  propertyâ€™s economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This ensures that
  the net income from the rental property is measured appropriately each year. Current
  law allows depreciation that is accelerated relative to economic depreciation. However,
  the depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference tax law, and
  thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference tax law. Under normal
  tax baseline, in contrast, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic
  depreciation.
