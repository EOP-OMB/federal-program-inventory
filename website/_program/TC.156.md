objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, under current
  law employer-provided accident and disability benefits are excluded from an employee’s
  gross income even though the employer’s costs for the benefits are a deductible
  business expense.
