objective: 'Since 1996, in partnership with industry associations, universities and
  other government agencies, EPA has supported the development and maintenance of
  the Compliance Assistance Centers and Center resources. Each Center is targeted
  to a specific industry, group of industries, local government, or Federal facilities,
  and explains in plain language the environmental regulations that apply to that
  sector and offers technical assistance on compliance. Funding Priorities - Fiscal
  Year 2023: Funding will support the web-based Compliance Assistance Centers. Through
  Internet Websites, e-mail discussion groups and more, the Centers will help businesses,
  local governments, and federal facilities understand federal environmental requirements
  and save money through pollution prevention techniques.'
