  year: '2018'
- description: 'In collaboration with the Naval Air Warfare Center Patuxent River
    facility, the grantee worked to recruit high-school students, with an emphasis
    on women and other underrepresented minorities, to a 6-year DON STEM Workforce
    Matriculation Program that afforded students the opportunity to engage in DON
    relevant projects that will lead them to graduate with both a B.S. in a STEM major
    and an M.S. in Flight Test Engineering (FTE). In addition, the program allowed
    students who were already enrolled at grantee, the opportunity to earn a certificate
    in FTE, a program that helps develop their skills to be flight test-ready engineers
    upon graduation and to increase their readiness to enter the DON STEM workforce.


    By the completion of the program, the grantee had met all their program goals,
    resulting in 281 K-12 students being inspired, 190 undergraduate students being
    flown in FTE aircraft, 8 Senior Design projects funded, 32 new enrollments at
    the Patuxent River Naval Air Station (Pax NAS) Education Center, and numerous
    students with STEM degrees from grantee. The program also included uniformed members
    of Navy and current Navy civilians as successful recipients of the M.S. degree
    in FTE and the FTE certificate. In addition, a number of students selected civilian
    and contractor DON STEM careers including working at or in support of Pax NAS.'

- description: 'Our materials provide solutions to these challenges by taking students
    through an engaging series of lessons packaged with characters ‘Slybert’ and ‘Cybert’
    an antagonist and protagonist modeling how to identify and prevent threats in
    cyber that they or their families and friends may experience. Our resource materials
    also cover a range of topic areas, helping students to explore the range of content
    that a career in cybersecurity, science, and technology could bring for them.
    For fiscal year 2022, the following lessons were prepared and completed and are
    now undergoing testing with students for feedback, iteration, and improvement:
    Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (“CIA Triad”), Data to Protect, How the
    Internet Works-Protocols, Data to Protect, Threat Agents and Threats: Who Wants
    My Stuff and Why Do They Want It?, Encryption, Fishing/Phishing, and Hashing.'
