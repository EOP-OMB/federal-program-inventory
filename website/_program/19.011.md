objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is\
  \ premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of leaders\
  \ and future leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies\
  \ and affect official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA\
  \ programs inform, engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of\
  \ society \u2013 including young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists,\
  \ and other professionals \u2013 increasing the number of U.S. citizens having international\
  \ experiences and of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience with Americans\
  \ and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic\
  \ choice, and individual dignity, while building international knowledge and capacity\
  \ among Americans and citizens of other countries.  The purpose of Special Academic\
  \ Exchange Programs is to provide targeted support for U.S. and foreign students\
  \ and others who may not otherwise have the resources to pursue international exchange\
  \ opportunities or who are in fields directly relevant to identified needs in their\
  \ countries."
