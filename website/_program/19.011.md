objective: As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and
  Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people
  of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and
  cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals,
  students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage dialogue
  with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is premised
  on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of leaders and future
  leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official
  decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs inform, engage,
  and influence participants across strategic sectors of society – including young
  people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals – increasing
  the number of U.S. citizens having international experiences and of foreign individuals
  who have first-hand experience with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative
  government, rule of law, economic choice, and individual dignity, while building
  international knowledge and capacity among Americans and citizens of other countries.  The
  purpose of Special Academic Exchange Programs is to provide targeted support for
  U.S. and foreign students and others who may not otherwise have the resources to
  pursue international exchange opportunities or who are in fields directly relevant
  to identified needs in their countries.
