objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, would be included in taxable income. Dedicated payments and
  in-kind benefits represent accretions to wealth that do not differ materially from
  cash wages. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a taxpayer’s taxable
  income for passes, tokens, fare cards, and vanpool expenses that are paid for by
  an employer or that are received by the employee in lieu of wages to defray an employee’s
  commuting costs. Due to a parity to parking provision, the maximum amount of the
  transit exclusion is $315 per month in 2024. However, beginning in 2018, transit
  expenses are no longer deductible to employers.
