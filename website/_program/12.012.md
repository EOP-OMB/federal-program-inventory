- description: "1- To address noxious weed management on the regional level with an\
    \ integrated approach in cooperation with federal, state, county, municipal and\
    \ private landowners.\n\nExample: A regional approach is the only effective way\
    \ to address noxious weeds on the ecosystem level. Separate, isolated treatment\
    \ plans may be contradictory and may not result in effective management.\n\n2-\
    \ To treat infestations of noxious weeds and undesirable plants in order to allow\
    \ native vegetation to re-establish. \n\nExample: Poison Oak, while a native species\
    \ in many areas, presents safety issues in recreation areas on public lands and\
    \ adjacent lands, and is removed as needed.\n\n3- To stop the spread of noxious\
    \ weeds and undesirable plants into natural landscapes. \n\nExamples: Large efforts\
    \ are underway to halt the spread of the escaped ornamental Flowering Rush on\
    \ public lands."
