objective: "CDC\u2019s global health priorities include efforts towards ending the\
  \ global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic by:  expanding access to improved screening,\
  \ contact tracing, and diagnostic tools to find the missing TB cases (FIND); optimizing\
  \ treatment for TB and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB, including identifying and\
  \ evaluating better treatment regimens, and expanding access to care and treatment\
  \ (CURE); breaking the cycle of TB transmission by strengthening infection control,\
  \ identifying TB hotspots to target screening, and scaling-up treatment to prevent\
  \ TB (PREVENT); and helping countries strengthen their surveillance and laboratory\
  \ systems, and workforce and research capacity to support sustainable health systems\
  \ including promoting the wider use and adoption of recommended TB strategies and\
  \ guidelines (SUSTAIN)."
