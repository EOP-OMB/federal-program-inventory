results:
- description: The project accomplishes its public purpose by implementing a best
    management practice through the timing of discharges to the Lower San Joaquin
    River (LSJR) through a Real Time Management Program (RTMP).  This will improve
    water quality, conserve water by reducing reliance on dilution flows from New
    Melones Reservoir and improve avian and salmon habitats within the LSJR watershed.
    As a public Benefit, the project will address salinity discharges from Grassland
    Resource Conservation District wetlands to the LSJR watershed that includes implementation
    of mitigation actions for areas of high salt accumulation such as wetlands and
    agriculture discharges.
