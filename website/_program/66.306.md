objective: "The Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving (EJCPS) Cooperative\
  \ Agreement Program provides funding to support community-based organizations in\
  \ their efforts to collaborate and partner with local stakeholder groups (e.g.,\
  \ local businesses and industry, local government, medical service providers, and\
  \ academia) as they develop and implement solutions that address environmental and/or\
  \ public health issues for underserved communities. For purposes of this listing,\
  \ the term \u201Cunderserved community\u201D refers to a community with environmental\
  \ justice concerns and/or vulnerable populations, including people of color, low\
  \ income, rural, tribal, indigenous, and homeless populations. Eligible projects\
  \ must demonstrate use of the Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving\
  \ Model to support their collaborative efforts during the project period. Applying\
  \ organizations should have a direct connection to the underserved community impacted\
  \ by the environmental harms and risks detailed in the workplan. The long-term goals\
  \ of the EJCPS Program are to help build the capacity of communities with environmental\
  \ justice concerns and to create self-sustaining, community-based partnerships that\
  \ will continue to improve local environments in the future.\n\nFunding Priorities\
  \ - Fiscal Year 2023: For the 2023 competition, EPA may give special consideration\
  \ to high-ranking applications that focus on the following program priorities: 1)\
  \ Rural Areas \u2013 EPA may give special consideration to high-ranking proposals\
  \ to be performed in rural areas as defined by the program. Rural areas, for the\
  \ purposes of this competition, are defined as local areas with populations of 50,000\
  \ or less that have limited access to public or private resources commonly found\
  \ in metropolitan areas. Applicants claiming rural status must provide sufficient\
  \ detail (census data, population figures, descriptions of local resources, etc.)\
  \ for EPA to validate the rural status of the underserved community. The goal of\
  \ this special consideration is to encourage and increase project performance in\
  \ rural areas in the EPA EJ Grants program. 2) Health Impact Assessments (HIA) \u2013\
  \ HIA is a tool designed to investigate how a proposed program, project, policy,\
  \ or plan may impact health and well-being and inform decision-makers of these potential\
  \ outcomes before the decision is made. EPA may give special consideration to HIA\
  \ projects that seek to determine the potential effects of a proposed decision on\
  \ the health of underserved and vulnerable communities and the distribution of those\
  \ effects within the communities. 3) Projects addressing Climate, Disaster Resiliency,\
  \ and/or Emergency Preparedness \u2013 The effects of climate change and extreme\
  \ weather events tend to adversely impact the most vulnerable communities and populations\
  \ disproportionately. Therefore, EPA may give special consideration to projects\
  \ that address the needs of underserved and vulnerable communities that have been\
  \ adversely impacted or are likely to be adversely impacted by natural disasters,\
  \ including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, earthquakes,\
  \ and future pandemics."
