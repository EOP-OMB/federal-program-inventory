objective: 'The Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving (EJCPS) Cooperative
  Agreement Program provides funding to support community-based organizations in their
  efforts to collaborate and partner with local stakeholder groups (e.g., local businesses
  and industry, local government, medical service providers, and academia) as they
  develop and implement solutions that address environmental and/or public health
  issues for underserved communities. For purposes of this listing, the term “underserved
  community” refers to a community with environmental justice concerns and/or vulnerable
  populations, including people of color, low income, rural, tribal, indigenous, and
  homeless populations. Eligible projects must demonstrate use of the Environmental
  Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Model to support their collaborative efforts
  during the project period. Applying organizations should have a direct connection
  to the underserved community impacted by the environmental harms and risks detailed
  in the workplan. The long-term goals of the EJCPS Program are to help build the
  capacity of communities with environmental justice concerns and to create self-sustaining,
  community-based partnerships that will continue to improve local environments in
  the future.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: For the 2023 competition, EPA may give special
  consideration to high-ranking applications that focus on the following program priorities:
  1) Rural Areas – EPA may give special consideration to high-ranking proposals to
  be performed in rural areas as defined by the program. Rural areas, for the purposes
  of this competition, are defined as local areas with populations of 50,000 or less
  that have limited access to public or private resources commonly found in metropolitan
  areas. Applicants claiming rural status must provide sufficient detail (census data,
  population figures, descriptions of local resources, etc.) for EPA to validate the
  rural status of the underserved community. The goal of this special consideration
  is to encourage and increase project performance in rural areas in the EPA EJ Grants
  program. 2) Health Impact Assessments (HIA) – HIA is a tool designed to investigate
  how a proposed program, project, policy, or plan may impact health and well-being
  and inform decision-makers of these potential outcomes before the decision is made.
  EPA may give special consideration to HIA projects that seek to determine the potential
  effects of a proposed decision on the health of underserved and vulnerable communities
  and the distribution of those effects within the communities. 3) Projects addressing
  Climate, Disaster Resiliency, and/or Emergency Preparedness – The effects of climate
  change and extreme weather events tend to adversely impact the most vulnerable communities
  and populations disproportionately. Therefore, EPA may give special consideration
  to projects that address the needs of underserved and vulnerable communities that
  have been adversely impacted or are likely to be adversely impacted by natural disasters,
  including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, earthquakes,
  and future pandemics.'

results:
- description: 'Each of the recipients were awarded up to $120,000 to support two-year
    projects. The projects include such activities as identifying and reducing exposures
    to sources of air pollution; reducing lead exposure in homes of low-income residents;
    and managing stormwater runoff to support clean water and safer drinking water
    . Projects must use the Collaborative Problem Solving model, comprised of seven
    elements of a successful collaborative partnership, to address local environmental
    and/or public health issues.  The FY 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided
    $21,000,000 ($20,809,000 with rescission applied) for EPA to issue grants to states
    and tribes to assist with implementing environmental programs. EPA provided $19,809,000
    to states and territories to support implementation of air and state-led climate
    activities and other state-identified high priority activities. Based on EPA’s
    grant guidance, states are to direct at least 65% of their funding to support
    air work and may use up to 35% of their funding on other state-identified activities.
    EPA also provided $1,000,000 to tribes that have obtained authorization to develop
    water quality standards. All 56 states, territories, and the District of Columbia
    accepted their allocated share of multipurpose grant funding. Tribes are using
    multipurpose funding to complement and enhance implementation of their water quality
    standards programs in conjunction with existing Clean Water Act Section 106 activities. '

- description: 'A few examples of some of the projects funded under this assistance
    listing include: 1) increasing the number of healthy residential housing units
    available and empowering those residents to access healthy housing; 2) a program
    composed of teams of young leaders serving to address environmental challenges
    in the community by working directly with a local collaborative initiative to
    plan and execute a demonstration project creating community engagement and an
    active portal empowering the community to report illegal dumping; 3) monitoring
    the disproportionate air and water quality hazards experienced by two historically
    African American neighborhoods and informing residents about the severity of those
    hazards and steps they can take to better protect themselves and their families
    from those environmental impacts; 4) creating coastal community collaborations
    between rural towns on a shoreline in order to develop and implement water quality
    improvements in the area; and 5) addressing water contamination by hiring a watershed
    group coordinator to organize activities, field trips and watershed education
    activities and trainings for collaborative members and the public, including the
    creation of an outreach plan and information materials, and conducting public
    meetings to establish broad-based, diverse membership.'

  year: '2019'
- description: 'The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) selected 34 organizations
    to each receive up to $200,000 through the Environmental Justice Collaborative
    Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program (EJCPS). Approximately $4.3 million
    of American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds will support projects that address health
    outcome disparities from pollution and the COVID–19 pandemic and that identify
    and address disproportionate environmental or public health harms and risks in
    minority populations or low-income populations through activities authorized by
    section 103(b) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7403(b)) and section 1442(c)(3)
    of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j–1(c)). An approximate amount of
    $2.5 million from EPA’s Fiscal Year 2021 annual appropriation for environmental
    justice (EJ) will fund additional community-based projects. Additional program
    accomplishments for 2021 can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/environmental-justice-collaborative-problem-solving-cooperative-agreement-5.'
