  programs identified in EPA''s annual appropriations act, explanatory statements
  and/or committee reports incorporated by reference into the annual appropriations
  act, and other statutes mandating that EPA provide financial assistance agreements
  to Congressionally designated recipients in specified amounts for identified projects
  or programs.   The projects may be associated with: (1) environmental requirements;
  (2) identifying, developing, and/or demonstrating necessary pollution control technologies
  and techniques to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution; (3) evaluating the economic
  and social consequences of alternative environmental pollution strategies, technologies,
  or mechanisms for use by those in economic, social, governmental, and environmental
  management positions; or (4) other activities described in the applicable statute.  Funding
  priorities are to award these assistance agreements to the designated recipients
  as quickly as possible in compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements.'
