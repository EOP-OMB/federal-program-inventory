objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow deductions and exemptions or preferentially
  low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast,
  for tax years 2018 to 2025, the Tax Code allows for a deduction equal to up to 20
  percent of income attributable to domestic pass-through businesses, subject to certain
  limitations.
