objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all profits and income under
  the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax
  rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code
  allows certain companies that operate U.S. flag vessels to defer income taxes on
  that portion of their income used for shipping purposes (e.g., primarily construction,
  modernization and major repairs to ships, and repayment of loans to finance these
  investments).
