objective: "The mission of the Latin America Regional Program is to provide technical\
  \ and financial assistance to partners to conserve the region’s priority species\
  \ and their habitats. It advances its mission by supporting projects that reduce\
  \ threats to key wildlife species and strengthen local capacity that results in\
  \ measurable conservation impacts that benefit biodiversity and its people in the\
  \ long-term. \n\n \n\nProjects should address the following threats: unsustainable\
  \ resource use, habitat loss and fragmentation, agricultural expansion, human-wildlife\
  \ conflict, and climate change have on species and ecosystems. Therefore, this Program\
  \ will only consider projects that clearly articulate how the proposed actions will\
  \ reduce these above-mentioned threats under at least one of the following two categories:\
  \  \n\n \n\nSpecies Conservation: This category seeks to support projects that promote\
  \ the recovery and conservation efforts of key terrestrial species and their habitats\
  \ along their range. Proposed activities can be implemented on the local, national,\
  \ or regional (transnational) level, and can involve more than one priority species.\
  \ Species should meet the criteria to be listed either as “Endangered” or “Threatened”\
  \ on the ESA, or as “Critically Endangered,” “Endangered,” or “Vulnerable” on the\
  \ International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Species listed\
  \ as “Data Deficient” or “Extinct in Wild” on the IUCN Red List are not eligible\
  \ under this NOFO. \n\n \n\nConservation Stewardship: This category seeks to support\
  \ projects that assist communities living in and along critical wildlife corridors\
  \ and strongholds, by building on their traditional land-use practices, governance\
  \ principles, ethnobiological knowledge and reduce their costs of living with wildlife.\
  \ Proposed activities can be implemented on the local, national or regional (transnational)\
  \ level. Projects are to be implemented in or around natural protected areas, biological\
  \ corridors, and recovery units in:  \n\n \n\nMexico:  \n\nSpecies: jaguar.  \n\n\
  Geographic Eligibility: Yucatan Peninsula and Lacandon jungle.  \n\n \n\nCentral\
  \ America:  \n\nGeographic Eligibility: Guatemala and Honduras.  \n\n \n\nSouth\
  \ America:  \n\nGeographic Eligibility: Gran Chaco (Eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, and\
  \ northern. Argentina) and Andes-Amazon (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru)."
