- description: Given the impact Emmett Till's lynching had on America, in 2022, President
    Biden signed the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act into law after more than 200 attempts
    to make lynching a federal hate crime. In 2016, the program was authorized as
    part of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act. Upon
    receiving funding in 2020, BJA launched the Emmett Till Cold Case Investigations
    and Prosecution Program.  Please see https://bja.ojp.gov/program/emmett-till-cold-case-investigations-and-prosecution-program/news
