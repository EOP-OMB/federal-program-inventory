- description: The program was first funded in FY2020, in which BJA made one award.
    BJA issued a solicitation in FY2021 which seeks to fund additional awards and
    also so support national training and technical assistance.
  year: '2020'
- description: BJA made $1.5 million in site-based awards under the Emmett Till Unsolved
    Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016 to help solve cold case civil
    rights murders that occurred before Dec. 31, 1979. Till, an African-American teenager,
    was visiting his family in Money, Mississippi, during the summer of 1955 when
    he was abducted, beaten and killed. Two local men were prosecuted for the crime
    but were acquitted by an all-white jury, though they later confessed to the killing.
    Till’s case helped galvanize the nascent civil rights movement. BJA awarded an
    additional $1.8 million to offer training and technical assistance to other communities
    seeking to resolve these cases, including making microgrants to the field.
  year: '2021'
- description: Given the impact Emmett Till's lynching had on America, in 2022, President
    Biden signed the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act into law after more than 200 attempts
    to make lynching a federal hate crime. In 2016, the program was authorized as
    part of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act. Upon
    receiving funding in 2020, BJA launched the Emmett Till Cold Case Investigations
    and Prosecution Program.  Please see https://bja.ojp.gov/program/emmett-till-cold-case-investigations-and-prosecution-program/news
