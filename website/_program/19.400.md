objective: As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and
  Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people
  of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and
  cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals,
  students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage dialogue
  with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is premised
  on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future leaders, and
  the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making
  almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs inform, engage, and influence
  participants across strategic sectors of society – including young people, women,
  teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals – increasing the number
  of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience with Americans and with the
  values of freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic choice, and
  individual dignity, while building international knowledge and capacity among Americans.  The
  purpose of the Fulbright Student Program is to promote mutual understanding by providing
  opportunities for American and foreign students to study, do research, and/or serve
  as teaching assistants of their native languages abroad.  The Fulbright Student
  Program includes program components for U.S. students, foreign students, Foreign
  Language Teaching Assistant Program, Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program,
  Fulbright-Fogarty Fellows, and the Fulbright-National Geographic Storytelling Fellowship
  program.
