objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators.  ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is\
  \ premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future\
  \ leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect\
  \ official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.  ECA programs inform,\
  \ engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of society \u2013\
  \ including young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals\
  \ \u2013 increasing the number of foreign individuals who have first-hand experience\
  \ with Americans and with the values of freedom, representative government, rule\
  \ of law, economic choice, and individual dignity, while building international\
  \ knowledge and capacity among Americans.  The purpose of the Fulbright Student\
  \ Program is to promote mutual understanding by providing opportunities for American\
  \ and foreign students to study, do research, and/or serve as teaching assistants\
  \ of their native languages abroad.  The Fulbright Student Program includes program\
  \ components for U.S. students, foreign students, Foreign Language Teaching Assistant\
  \ Program, Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program, Junior Faculty Development\
  \ and Regional Specialty Programs in the Western Hemisphere, Fulbright-Fogarty Fellows,\
  \ and the Fulbright-National Geographic Storytelling Fellowship program."
