- description: "In FY 2016, the FAA COE Program Office anticipates to award $22,500,000\
    \ in support of FAA projects.  The FAA will complete plans to establish a Center\
    \ of Excellence for the Air Traffic Organization in 2016. A Public Meeting was\
    \ held, Draft and Final Solicitations were posted, proposals were received, and\
    \ Technical and Management/Fiscal Evaluations have been completed.  Announcement\
    \ of the selected team is planned for June 2016. The FAA COE Program Office will\
    \ negotiate cooperative agreements with member universities in FY 2016. In FY\
    \ 2016, the FAA COE Program Management Office (PMO) awarded $28,397,118 in support\
    \ of 160 FAA projects, negotiated and executed 16 COE cooperative agreements,\
    \ issued 225 funded grant awards, executed 66 other COE actions, and generated\
    \ more than $29 million in matching contributions from industry and other non-federal\
    \ sources.  \r\nAdditionally, the FAA COE PMO conducted and completed a competition\
    \ to establish the COE for Technical Training and Human Performance (TTHP) and\
    \ finalized significant pre-award activities and the award of 65 awards in preparation\
    \ for the establishment of the new COE in September 2016. The pre-award competitive\
    \ process culminated in the submission of proposals representing universities\
    \ throughout the U.S. and their industry and other affiliates. The COE PMO invited\
    \ subject-matter-experts from various federal organizations to participate in\
    \ the conduct of a technical evaluation of the submissions. Management and fiscal\
    \ officers were additionally invited to conduct a review of the best qualified\
    \ proposals from a non-technical perspective. The process enabled the FAA Administrator\
    \ to select the new COE TTHP team in FY 2016, on schedule as planned. The COE\
    \ PMO negotiated and entered into 16 new cooperative agreements with the COE core\
    \ universities.\r\n"

- description: "During Fiscal Year 2023, FAA's five active COE's with public-private\
    \ partnerships throughout the United States with academic institutions other affiliates\
    \ successfully performed research for a wide range of topic areas.\n\nThe FAA\
    \ Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment, also known as\
    \ the Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT), is paving the way for sustainable\
    \ aviation through its innovative research program. ASCENT now includes over 80\
    \ projects covering critical issues in aviation including emissions, noise, operations,\
    \ aircraft technologies, and supersonics. ASCENT research continues to advance\
    \ the area of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a topic of growing importance.\
    \ ASCENT researchers play key roles in the development and deployment of SAF,\
    \ working to test and certify fuels to ensure both safety and sustainability.\
    \ ASCENT Project 31 established the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse, a centralized resource\
    \ for fuel producers going through the fuel qualification process. The Clearinghouse\
    \ coordinates testing and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) review of new\
    \ fuels. To date, seven pathways are annexed under D7566. The most recent pathway\
    \ was the first Fast Track approval, requiring only 50 gallons of fuel compared\
    \ to earlier approvals that used over half a million gallons of fuel. Two additional\
    \ co-processing pathways are annexed under ASTM D1655: Standard Specification\
    \ for Aviation Turbine Fuels. Other ASCENT projects continue to advance fuel approval,\
    \ focusing on improving fuel testing methods to lessen the burden of fuel approval\
    \ from both time and cost perspectives. \n\nThe FAA Center of Excellence for General\
    \ Aviation's Project 29 was featured in a FAA-led publication \n(www.faa.gov/news/safety_briefing).\
    \ \nThere also was an article written about the same project on the following\
    \ aviation website \n(https://medium.com/faa/making-it-count-c2e78a40c782). \n\
    The project covers “How Aircraft Transponder Signals Take the Guesswork Out of\
    \ Counting Non-Towered Airport Operations”. The research proved to be a winning\
    \ concept that generates cost-effective, accurate, and detailed operations counts.\
    \ A transportation data services company called Quality Counts has already bought\
    \ the license for this novel technology and has a product. Looking ahead, the\
    \ data collection continues. Further research involves refining the overall process\
    \ to ensure the greatest possible accuracy in the count registration, including\
    \ a means to gather more data, such as aircraft type. This information can provide\
    \ additional insight to airport managers about the fleet mix of aircraft operating\
    \ at their airports.\n\nThe FAA Joint Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials\
    \ (JAMS) created the First Public Database for Additive Manufacturing.  Additive\
    \ manufacturing (AM) presents significant opportunities for several applications\
    \ to produce parts with low lead times and close to the point of use. AM has not\
    \ been fully realized due to high manufacturing variability, uncertainty of the\
    \ performance effects of material defects, and the lack of pedigreed data and\
    \ widely-accepted methodologies/standards for qualifying materials and processes.\
    \  In partnership with the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Air Force Research\
    \ Laboratory, Wichita State University National Institute for Aviation Research\
    \ (WSU-NIAR) conducted a program under the FAA Joint Advanced Materials & Structures\
    \ Center of Excellence (JAMS) to qualify an additively manufactured material.\
    \  Through this program, WSU-NIAR also partnered with America Makes to form a\
    \ team from rp+m (a small business in Ohio), Stratasys, and Lockheed Martin. This\
    \ team then solidified a partnership with the National Center for Advanced Material\
    \ Performance (NCAMP) at WSU-NIAR. NCAMP works closely with the FAA, DoD, and\
    \ aerospace industry to qualify material systems and provide material and process\
    \ (M&P) specifications and performance data to the aerospace community. A government\
    \ steering committee and industry technical advisory team of aviation OEMs supported\
    \ the program.\n\nThrough the University of Oklahoma and FAA's Civil Aerospace\
    \ Medical Institute, the Center of Excellence for Technical Training and Human\
    \ Performance (COE TTHP) delivered critical research entitled “Characterization\
    \ and Application of Air Traffic Controllers Visual Search Patterns and Control\
    \ Strategies for Efficient and Effective Training”.  The goal of this work was\
    \ to understand how experienced controllers visually search, select, compare,\
    \ and control multiple aircraft under different situations to develop concrete\
    \ training examples of visual scanning and aircraft control strategies related\
    \ to enroute conflict detection and resolution.  Five dominant visual search patterns\
    \ were discovered: spiral, circular, linear, quadrant, and mixed.  Other diverse\
    \ strategies were discovered based on factors such as conflict types, sector characteristics,\
    \ and customer service priorities."
