objective: 'This grant program funds activities in both the LUST prevention and cleanup
  programs. On the Prevention program, grants are used for activities that promote
  the prevention, compliance, and identification of underground storage tanks. For
  the cleanup program, grants are used to support activities that promote corrective
  action, enforcement and management of releases from underground storage tank systems.
  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: High priority tasks include: (1) Working with
  states and tribes within available resources to reduce the number of sites that
  have not reached cleanup completion; (2) Provide targeted training to states and
  tribes, such as remediation process optimization and rapid site assessment techniques;
  (3) Monitor the soundness of financial mechanisms, in particular, insurance and
  state cleanup funds that serve as financial assurance for LUST releases; (4) Provide
  support in Indian Country for site assessment, investigations, and remediation of
  high priority sites; and (5) Provide resources and support to states and tribes
  to quickly address emergency responses from releases to the environment.'
