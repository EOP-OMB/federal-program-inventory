  action, enforcement and management of releases from underground storage tank systems.
  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: High priority tasks include: (1) Working with
  states and tribes within available resources to reduce the number of sites that
  have not reached cleanup completion; (2) Provide targeted training to states and
  tribes, such as remediation process optimization and rapid site assessment techniques;
  (3) Monitor the soundness of financial mechanisms, in particular, insurance and
  state cleanup funds that serve as financial assurance for LUST releases; (4) Provide
  support in Indian Country for site assessment, investigations, and remediation of
  high priority sites; and (5) Provide resources and support to states and tribes
  to quickly address emergency responses from releases to the environment.'
