objective: 'The Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) program increases diversity
  in the health professions and nursing workforce by providing awards to eligible
  health professions schools for use in awarding scholarships to students from disadvantaged
  backgrounds who have financial need, including students who are members of racial
  and ethnic minority groups. The SDS program aims to increase the: 1) number of graduates
  practicing in primary care, 2) enrollment and retention of full-time students from
  disadvantaged backgrounds, including students who are members of racial and ethnic
  minority groups, and 3) number of graduates working in medically underserved communities
  (MUCs). Schools provide scholarships, maintain and operate a program to recruit
  and retain students from disadvantaged backgrounds that encourages completion of
  school and service in primary care and in medically underserved communities.'
