objective: 'The Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) program increases diversity
  in the health professions and nursing workforce by providing awards to eligible
  health professions schools for use in awarding scholarships to students from disadvantaged
  backgrounds who have financial need, including students who are members of racial
  and ethnic minority groups. The SDS program aims to increase the: 1) number of graduates
  practicing in primary care, 2) enrollment and retention of full-time students from
  disadvantaged backgrounds, including students who are members of racial and ethnic
  minority groups, and 3) number of graduates working in medically underserved communities
  (MUCs). Schools provide scholarships, maintain and operate a program to recruit
  and retain students from disadvantaged backgrounds that encourages completion of
  school and service in primary care and in medically underserved communities.'

results:
- description: 'In Academic Year (AY) 2021-2022 the SDS Program provided scholarships
    to 2,676 students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The majority of students were
    considered under-represented minorities (URMs) in their prospective professions
    (69 percent). Additionally, 1,193 students who received SDS-funded scholarships
    successfully graduated from their degree programs by the end of AY 2021-2022.
    Upon graduation, 54 percent currently work in medically underserved communities
    and 28 percent work in primary care settings.  SDS students also trained in a
    variety of clinical settings: 67 percent in medically underserved communities,
    37 percent in primary care settings, and 15 percent in rural areas. Furthermore,
    SDS students received additional training on topics such as health equity (50
    percent) and integrating behavioral health into primary care (30 percent).'
