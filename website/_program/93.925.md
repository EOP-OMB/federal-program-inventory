objective: 'The Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) program increases diversity
  in the health professions and nursing workforce by providing awards to eligible
  health professions schools for use in awarding scholarships to students from disadvantaged
  backgrounds who have financial need, including students who are members of racial
  and ethnic minority groups. The SDS program aims to increase the: 1) number of graduates
  practicing in primary care, 2) enrollment and retention of full-time students from
  disadvantaged backgrounds, including students who are members of racial and ethnic
  minority groups, and 3) number of graduates working in medically underserved communities
  (MUCs). Schools provide scholarships, maintain and operate a program to recruit
  and retain students from disadvantaged backgrounds that encourages completion of
  school and service in primary care and in medically underserved communities.'

results:
- description: In Academic Year 2017-2018, the SDS Program provided scholarships to
    3,047 students from disadvantaged backgrounds, slightly below the FY 2017 target
    but an increase from the prior year of 2,811 scholarships. This was due in large
    part to fewer grants being awarded in FY 2016 as well as a significant increase
    in the scholarship limit per student (increased from $15,000 to $30,000), resulting
    in more substantial investments in fewer individuals. The adjustment to the scholarship
    cap was made to reflect the increasing costs of health professions education programs.
    The majority of students were considered under-represented minorities (URMs) in
    their prospective professions (64 percent). Additionally, 1,051 students who received
    SDS-funded scholarships successfully graduated from their degree programs by the
    end of Academic Year 2017-2018. Upon graduation, 68 percent intended to work or
    pursue additional training in medically underserved communities, and 52 percent
    intended to work or pursue additional training in primary care settings.
