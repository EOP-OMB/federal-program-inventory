- description: "Suisun Marsh is the largest contiguous brackish water marsh remaining\
    \ on the west coast of North America. In the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s the marsh\
    \ was recognized by state and federal legislators to be at risk from increased\
    \ urbanization and salinity intrusion. To preserve and protect this unique and\
    \ irreplaceable resource, state and federal legislation was enacted. To codify\
    \ the collaboration and partnership between the state of California, U.S. Department\
    \ of Interior and the local resource district, a cooperative agreement was signed,\
    \ known as Suisun Marsh Preservation Agreement (SMPA), to manage the wetlands\
    \ through the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of certain channels,\
    \ levees, and control structures. The SMPA defines the roles and responsibilities\
    \ for management of the marsh along with identifying how management costs are\
    \ shared.  \n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Reclamation funded the planning and permitting\
    \ of State Water Project Suisun Marsh facilities, operation and maintenance of\
    \ those facilities, water and biological monitoring within Suisun Marsh, wetland\
    \ management, and environmental compliance and reporting."
