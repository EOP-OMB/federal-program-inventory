- description: Over 420 acres of land has been restored to tidal marsh. Another 818
    acres of tidal marsh is currently being in progress of being restored. Restoration
    of tidal wetlands in the Marsh will contribute to the recovery of special-status
    wildlife species, including small mammals (SMHM, Suisun shrew), birds (California
    clapper rail, California black rail, Suisun song sparrow, salt marsh common yellowthroat),
    and fish (salmonids, delta smelt, longfin smelt, Sacramento splittail, green sturgeon),
    and plants (soft bird’s-beak, Suisun thistle, Delta tule pea). Tidal wetland restoration
    also will be designed to accommodate sea level rise more easily than managed wetlands
    because the gradual elevations within tidal wetlands will not require the same
    level of levee maintenance and will provide an area for sediment accretion.

- description: 'Suisun Marsh is the largest contiguous brackish water marsh remaining
    on the west coast of North America. In the 1970’s and 80’s the marsh was recognized
    by state and federal legislators to be at risk from increased urbanization and
    salinity intrusion. To preserve and protect this unique and irreplaceable resource,
    state and federal legislation was enacted. To codify the collaboration and partnership
    between the state of California, U.S. Department of Interior and the local resource
    district, a cooperative agreement was signed, known as Suisun Marsh Preservation
    Agreement (SMPA), to manage the wetlands through the design, construction, operation,
    and maintenance of certain channels, levees, and control structures. The SMPA
    defines the roles and responsibilities for management of the marsh along with
    identifying how management costs are shared. In 2022 and 2023, Reclamation funded
    the planning and permitting of State Water Project Suisun Marsh facilities, operation
    and maintenance of those facilities, water and biological monitoring within Suisun
    Marsh, wetland management, and environmental compliance and reporting.

    In 2021 and 2022, Reclamation funded the planning and permitting of State Water
    Project Suisun Marsh facilities, operation and maintenance of those facilities,
    water and biological monitoring within Suisun Marsh, wetland management, and environmental
    compliance and reporting.'
