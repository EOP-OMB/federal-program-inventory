objective: "The intent of this program is to fund state, local, and territorial public\
  \ health departments for HHS Secretarial declared and non-declared public health\
  \ emergencies having an overwhelming impact on jurisdictional resources. These emergencies\
  \ require federal support to effectively respond to, manage, and address a significant\
  \ public health threat. CDC seeks to enhance the Nation\u2019s ability to rapidly\
  \ mobilize and respond to specific public health crises or emergencies. In addition\
  \ to immediate response activities, this program provides a mechanism to accelerate\
  \ readiness for an impending infectious disease threat or other public health crises\
  \ identified on the event horizon."
