objective: The intent of this program is to fund state, local, and territorial public
  health departments for HHS Secretarial declared and non-declared public health emergencies
  having an overwhelming impact on jurisdictional resources. These emergencies require
  federal support to effectively respond to, manage, and address a significant public
  health threat. CDC seeks to enhance the Nation’s ability to rapidly mobilize and
  respond to specific public health crises or emergencies. In addition to immediate
  response activities, this program provides a mechanism to accelerate readiness for
  an impending infectious disease threat or other public health crises identified
  on the event horizon.
