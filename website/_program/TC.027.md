objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code provides an income
  tax credit for qualified cellulosic biofuel production which was renamed the Second
  generation biofuel producer credit. This provision expires on December 31, 2024.
