objective: The objective of the Agricultural Water Conservation Efficiency Program
  is to invite eligible applicants to leverage their money and resources by cost sharing
  with Reclamation on projects that save water, improve water management, increase
  water supply reliability, improve energy efficiency, and benefit endangered species.
  Projects that achieve this by directly enabling on-farm water conservation or water
  use efficiency projects that can be undertaken by farmers and ranchers remain a
  high priority for this program. Reclamation and the USDA's Natural Resource Conservation
  Service (NRCS) are encouraging water suppliers to work with farmers to identify
  the roles at play to facilitate and/or assist with on-farm improvements that contribute
  to water supply reliability in the State of California.

- description: 'Fiscal Year 2020: Two California projects received $1.65 million total
    in Ag Water Use Efficiency grants for fiscal year 2020. Combined with local cost-share
    contributions, these projects are expected to implement about $5.0 million in
    water management improvements during the next two years. The projects will better
    manage 6,138 acre-feet, increase district-level efficiencies and facilitate farm
    water use efficiency.'

- description: "Increase in the efficiency of water used for irrigation purposes within\
    \ California and resulting water savings.  FY22 funded 2 projects: \n\nThe Pipeline\
    \ Conveyance-Converting Wide Canals to Pipelines Project will convert 4,100 feet\
    \ of open canals to 18-inch PVC pipeline to increase water use efficiency and\
    \ reliability and reduce water losses due to seepage and evaporation. \n\nThe\
    \ Service Area Canal Reservoir Lining Project will line two reservoirs with high-density\
    \ polyethylene liner to reduce seepage and improve water reliability."
