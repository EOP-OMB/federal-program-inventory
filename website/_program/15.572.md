objective: The objective of the Agricultural Water Conservation Efficiency Program
  is to invite eligible applicants to leverage their money and resources by cost sharing
  with Reclamation on projects that save water, improve water management, increase
  water supply reliability, improve energy efficiency, and benefit endangered species.
  Projects that achieve this by directly enabling on-farm water conservation or water
  use efficiency projects that can be undertaken by farmers and ranchers remain a
  high priority for this program. Reclamation and the USDA's Natural Resource Conservation
  Service (NRCS) are encouraging water suppliers to work with farmers to identify
  the roles at play to facilitate and/or assist with on-farm improvements that contribute
  to water supply reliability in the State of California.
