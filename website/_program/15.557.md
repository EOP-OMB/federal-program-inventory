layout: program
objective: The objective of the Applied Science Grants is to improve access to and
  use of hydrologic data as well as to develop and improve water management tools
  and improve modeling and forecasting capabilities. Results from these projects will
  be used by water managers to increase water supply reliability, provide flexibility
  in water operations, improve water management, and support nature-based solutions.

- description: Information not available. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 and 2014, Applied
    Science Grants for the Desert and Southern Rockies LCCs combined more than $2.1
    million in Federal funding to enhance the management of natural and cultural resources
    that have a nexus to water resource management.  For example, once completed,
    the funded projects are expected to develop decision support tools and methodologies
    to incorporate ecological flows into water management models used for basin-wide
    water supply planning; develop new biological information about springs and seeps;
    and develop a web-based tool to facilitate conservation planning.  In Fiscal Year
    (FY) 2015 and 2016, the LCCs did not post an Announcement for financial assistance.
    Instead, the LCCs worked on building their technical capacity to assist their
    partners.  For example, the Desert LCC invested in data and website platform development
    to more efficiently communicate data and research to resource managers.

  year: '2017'
- description: 'In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, Applied Science Grants were used to develop
    tools and information to support water resources managers in the West.  Seven
    projects were selected for funding, including projects to improve access to water
    availability information through the development of web-based decision support
    tools, a project to improve the management of springs and related ecosystems,
    and a project to model drought conditions on Lake Mead to inform water treatment
    processes.


    In FY 2019, $3.5 million in Federal funding was used to fund 19 Applied Science
    Grant projects. These projects totaled over $8 million in applied science projects.'
