objective: "The COPS Office was established in 1994 to assist state, local and tribal\
  \ law enforcement agencies in enhancing effectiveness and building the capacity\
  \ to advance public safety through the implementation of community policing strategies.\
  \  Community policing entails developing partnerships between law enforcement agencies\
  \ and the communities they serve so they can work collaboratively to resolve problems\
  \ and build community trust.  It is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies\
  \ that support the systematic use of partnerships and problem solving techniques,\
  \ in order to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public\
  \ safety issues such as crime, social disorder, fear of crime, and satisfaction\
  \ with police services. Community policing is comprised of three key components:\r\
  \n\r\nCommunity Partnerships\r\nCollaborative partnerships between the law enforcement\
  \ agency and the individuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to\
  \ problems and increase trust in police: \r\n\r\n•\tOther government agencies \r\
  \n•\tCommunity members/groups \r\n•\tNonprofits/service providers \r\n•\tPrivate\
  \ businesses \r\n•\tMedia\t\r\n\r\nOrganizational Transformation\r\nThe alignment\
  \ of organizational management, structure, personnel, and information systems to\
  \ support community partnerships and proactive problem solving:\r\n      \r\n•\t\
  Agency management \r\n•\tClimate and culture \r\n•\tLeadership \r\n•\tLabor relations\

  \ of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems\
  \ to develop and rigorously evaluate effective responses:\r\n\r\n•\tScan: Identify\
  \ and prioritize problems \r\n•\tAnalysis: Research what is known about the problem\
  \ \r\n•\tResponse: Develop solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number\
  \        and                extent of problems \r\n•\tAssessment: Evaluate the success\
  \ of the responses \r\n•\tUse the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions\
