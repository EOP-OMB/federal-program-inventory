objective: "The COPS Office was established in 1994 to assist state, local and tribal\
  \ law enforcement agencies in enhancing effectiveness and building the capacity\
  \ to advance public safety through the implementation of community policing strategies.\
  \  Community policing entails developing partnerships between law enforcement agencies\
  \ and the communities they serve so they can work collaboratively to resolve problems\
  \ and build community trust.  It is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies\
  \ that support the systematic use of partnerships and problem solving techniques,\
  \ in order to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public\
  \ safety issues such as crime, social disorder, fear of crime, and satisfaction\
  \ with police services. Community policing is comprised of three key components:\r\
  \n\r\nCommunity Partnerships\r\nCollaborative partnerships between the law enforcement\
  \ agency and the individuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to\
  \ problems and increase trust in police: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tOther government agencies\
