objective: The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions or provide
  preferential treatment of certain sources of income or types of activities. In contrast,
  the Tax Code provided an exclusion of 50 percent, applied to ordinary rates with
  a maximum of a 28 percent tax rate, for capital gains from qualified small business
  stock held by individuals for more than 5 years; 75 percent for stock issued after
  February 17, 2009 and before September 28, 2010; and 100 percent for stock issued
  after September 27, 2010. A qualified small business is a corporation whose gross
  assets do not exceed $50 million as of the date of issuance of the stock.
