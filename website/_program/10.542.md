objective: 'The objective of the of the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT)
  program is to provide nutrition assistance on EBT cards for: (1) school-age children
  who would have received free or reduced price school meals under the National School
  Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) had their schools not been
  closed or operating with reduced hours for at least five (5) consecutive days due
  to the COVID-19 public health emergency; (2) SNAP-enrolled children in child care
  whose child care facility is closed or has reduced attendance or who live in the
  area of a school that is closed or has reduced attendance due to the COVID-19 public
  health emergency; and (3) school-age children eligible for free or reduced price
  school meals and SNAP-enrolled children in child care during the summer months,
  regardless of the operating status of their schools or child care facilities. Due
  to the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency on May 11, 2023, only school-aged
  children eligible for free or reduced price meals who attended an NSLP-participating
  school in School Year 2022-2023 are eligible for P-EBT benefits in Summer 2023.'
