objective: "This Program supports activities to: provide information and education\
  \ on autism  and other developmental disabilities (DD) to increase public awareness;\
  \ promote research into the development and validation of reliable screening tools\
  \ and interventions for autism and other developmental disabilities and disseminate\
  \ information; promote early screening of individuals with increased likelihood\
  \ for autism  and other developmental disabilities as early as practicable, given\
  \ evidence-based screening techniques and interventions; increase the number of\
  \ professionals who are able to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of autism and other\
  \ developmental disabilities; and increase the number of professionals able to provide\
  \ evidence-based interventions for individuals diagnosed with autism  or other developmental\
  \ disabilities.  \n\n \n\nThe Autism Research Portfolio includes the Autism Research\
  \ Network Program (Autism RN) Program, Autism Single Investigator Innovation Program\
  \ (Autism SIIP), Autism Field-Initiated Innovative Research Studies (Autism FIRST)\
  \ Program, and the Autism Secondary Data Analysis Research (Autism SDAR) Program.\
  \  The Autism RNs establish and maintain an interdisciplinary, multicenter research\
  \ forum for scientific collaboration and infrastructure building. They provide national\
  \ leadership in research to advance the evidence base on effective interventions\
  \ for children and adolescents with autism  and other developmental disabilities\
  \ (ASD/DD)  across the lifespan. The Research Networks develop guidelines for those\
  \ interventions and disseminate information related to such research and guidelines\
  \ as authorized by the Autism CARES Act of 2019 (Autism CARES Act).  The Autism\
  \ SIIP Program supports focused research on priority, emerging, and underdeveloped\
  \ research areas in autism  and other development disabilities (DD), with a special\
  \ focus on addressing the needs of underserved populations. The Autism FIRST Program\
  \ supports research studies testing the implementation of new/innovative strategies\
  \ that address critical issues surrounding the health of children and adolescents\
  \ with autism. These studies collect primary data to analyze public health trends\
  \ in their chosen area of focus within the Autism/DD, with awardees typically implementing\
  \ randomized control trials. The Autism SDAR Program supports secondary data analysis\
  \ of existing publicly available and accessible national databases and/or administrative\
  \ records to determine the evidence-based practices for interventions that improve\
  \ the physical and behavioral health of children and adolescents with autism/DD,\
  \ with a particular focus on addressing barriers to identification, diagnosis, interventions\
  \ and services among underserved populations and for whom there is limited evidence\
  \ of the effectiveness of interventions, and limited access to screening, diagnosis,\
  \ and treatment for autism/DD."

- description: "The Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program improves care\
    \ and outcomes for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\
    \ and other developmental disabilities (DDs) through training, advancing best\
    \ practices, and service.  The program supports training programs, research, and\
    \ state systems grants to:\r\n•\tImprove access to early screening, diagnosis\
    \ and intervention for children with ASD or other DDs;\r\n•\tIncrease the number\
    \ of professionals able to diagnose ASD and other DDs; \r\n•\tPromote the use\
    \ of evidence-based interventions for individuals at higher risk for ASD and other\
    \ DDs as early as possible;\r\n•\tIncrease the number of professionals able to\
    \ provide evidence-based interventions for individuals diagnosed with ASD or other\
    \ DDs;\r\n•\tProvide information and education on ASD and other DDs to increase\
    \ public awareness;\r\n•\tPromote research and information distribution on the\
    \ development and validation of reliable screening tools and interventions for\
    \ ASD and other DDs; and\r\n•\tPromote early screening of individuals at higher\
    \ risk for ASD and other DDs.\r\n\r\nTraining Programs:  The program has two main\
    \ training components, the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Other\
    \ Related Disabilities (LEND) program and the Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics\
    \ (DBP) Training program.  From 2011 – 2014, the LEND and DBP programs collectively:\r\
    \n•\tProvided diagnostic evaluations for ASD and other DDs to more than 224,000\
    \ children;\r\n•\tProvided training to nearly 16,000 pediatricians, DBP specialists,\
    \ and other health professionals; and\r\n•\tProvided more than 3,000 continuing\
    \ education events on early screening, diagnosis, and intervention that reached\
    \ over 214,000 pediatricians and other health professionals.\r\n\r\nResearch:\
    \ To improve the health and well-being of children with ASD, HRSA supports five\
    \ research networks and investigator-initiated autism intervention research projects.\
    \  From 2011 – 2014, the research programs collectively:\r\n•\tConducted 57 studies\
    \ on physical and behavioral health issues related to ASD and other DDs, screening\
    \ and diagnostic measures, early intervention, and transition to adulthood; \r\
    \n•\tDeveloped 42 new measures and tools, including diagnostic and screening tools\
    \ and outcome measures that are helping to guide provider practice;\r\n•\tPrepared\
    \ 209 publications for peer reviewed journals, of which 105 were published, and\
    \ the remainder were in progress.  HRSA’s autism research helps underserved populations\
    \ overcome barriers to diagnosis and access needed services.    \r\n\r\nState\
    \ Systems grants:  The Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program supports\
    \ state systems grants to improve access to comprehensive, coordinated health\
    \ care and related services for children and youth with ASD and other DDs."
