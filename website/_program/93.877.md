objective: "This Program supports activities to: provide information and education\
  \ on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disabilities (DD) to\
  \ increase public awareness; promote research into the development and validation\
  \ of reliable screening tools and interventions for autism spectrum disorder and\
  \ other developmental disabilities and disseminate information; promote early screening\
  \ of individuals with increased likelihood for autism spectrum disorder and other\
  \ developmental disabilities as early as practicable, given evidence-based screening\
  \ techniques and interventions; increase the number of professionals who are able\
  \ to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and other developmental\
  \ disabilities; and increase the number of professionals able to provide evidence-based\
  \ interventions for individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder or other\
  \ developmental disabilities.  \n\nThe Autism Research Portfolio includes the Autism\
  \ Research Network Program (Autism RN) Program, Autism Single Investigator Innovation\
  \ Program (Autism SIIP), Autism Field-Initiated Innovative Research Studies (Autism\
  \ FIRST) Program, and the Autism Secondary Data Analysis (Autism SDAR) Program.\
  \  The Autism RNs establish and maintain an interdisciplinary, multicenter research\
  \ forum for scientific collaboration and infrastructure building. They provide national\
  \ leadership in research to advance the evidence base on effective interventions\
  \ for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental\
  \ disabilities (ASD/DD) as they transition to adulthood across the lifespan. The\
  \ Research Networks develop guidelines for those interventions and disseminate information\
  \ related to such research and guidelines as authorized by the Autism CARES Act\
  \ of 2019 (Autism CARES Act).  The Autism SIIP Program supports focused research\
  \ on priority, emerging, and underdeveloped research areas in autism spectrum disorder\
  \ (ASD) and other development disabilities (DD), with a special focus on addressing\
  \ the needs of underserved populations. The Autism FIRST Program supports research\
  \ studies testing the implementation of new/innovative strategies that address critical\
  \ issues surrounding the health of children and adolescents with ASD. These studies\
  \ collect primary data to analyze public health trends in their chosen area of focus\
  \ within the Autism/DD, with awardees typically implementing randomized control\
  \ trials. The Autism SDAR Program supports secondary data analysis of existing publicly\
  \ available and accessible national databases and/or administrative records to determine\
  \ the evidence-based practices for interventions that improve the physical and behavioral\
  \ health of children and adolescents with ASD/DD, with a particular focus on addressing\
  \ barriers to identification, diagnosis, interventions and services among underserved\
  \ populations and for whom there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of interventions,\
  \ and limited access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for ASD/DD."

results:
- description: "In FY 2020,  the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related\
    \ Disabilities (LEND) and Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP) programs collectively\
    \ provided: \n\nDiagnostic services to confirm or rule out autism/DD to over 115,000\
    \ children. \n\nTraining to nearly 17,500 trainees in pediatrics, developmental-behavioral\
    \ pediatrics, other health professions, and people with lived experience.\n\n\
    Over 3,300 continuing education events on early screening, diagnosis, and services\
    \ that reached over 270,000 pediatricians and other health professionals.\n\n\
    Accomplishments from the Autism Research Networks and Autism Single Investigator\
    \ Innovation Programs in FY 2021 include: \n\nCompleted 95 studies on physical\
    \ and behavioral health issues related to autism/DD, screening and diagnostic\
    \ measures, early intervention, and transition to adulthood \n\nEnrolled 17,857\
    \ participants in primary research studies through 52 research sites across the\
    \ country and included 1,049,578 participants in secondary data analyses \n\n\
    Developed 65 peer-reviewed publications in leading scholarly journals \n\nResearch\
    \ findings contributed to the evidence that supports clinical and public health\
    \ recommendations. For example, research findings from the Autism Longitudinal\
    \ Data Project contributed to the evidence that support the following clinical\
    \ and public health recommendations: (1) updated CDC guidelines on lowering lead\
    \ exposure levels of health concern; and (2) consensus statement on acetaminophen\
    \ use during pregnancy published in Nature Review of Endocrinology.  \n\n \n\n\
    During 2020-2021, state systems awardees: \n\nPartnered with 6 primary care practices\
    \ to implement family navigation services and participate in provider trainings.\
    \ \n\nEmployed 28 family navigators. \n\nServed 1074 families by providing children\
    \ with autism/DD or with increased likelihood of being diagnosed with autism/DD\
    \ with screening, diagnosis, referral to early intervention or related services,\
    \ and enrollment in community-based services before 36 months of age. \n\nPromoted\
    \ and facilitated developmental screening services and follow-up. \n\nIncreased\
    \ awareness of autism/DD through stakeholder meetings, online learning communities,\
    \ or one-time trainings that covered autism generally, intervention services,\
    \ and assistance programs to families, primary care providers and community-based\
    \ providers. \n\nEngaged family members and family advocates through trainings\
    \ or training institutes, steering committees, and family support organizations\
    \ through: \n\n34 webinars for primary care physicians reaching 563 attendees;\
    \ \n\nCommunity and family trainings, reaching approximately 6000 participants;\
    \ and \n\nHosting six community and family learning communities on developmental\
    \ screenings, reaching over 600 participants."
