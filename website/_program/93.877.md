objective: "This Program supports activities to: provide information and education\
  \ on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disabilities (DD) to\
  \ increase public awareness; promote research into the development and validation\
  \ of reliable screening tools and interventions for autism spectrum disorder and\
  \ other developmental disabilities and disseminate information; promote early screening\
  \ of individuals with increased likelihood for autism spectrum disorder and other\
  \ developmental disabilities as early as practicable, given evidence-based screening\
  \ techniques and interventions; increase the number of professionals who are able\
  \ to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and other developmental\
  \ disabilities; and increase the number of professionals able to provide evidence-based\
  \ interventions for individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder or other\
  \ developmental disabilities.  \n\nThe Autism Research Portfolio includes the Autism\
  \ Research Network Program (Autism RN) Program, Autism Single Investigator Innovation\
  \ Program (Autism SIIP), Autism Field-Initiated Innovative Research Studies (Autism\
  \ FIRST) Program, and the Autism Secondary Data Analysis (Autism SDAR) Program.\
  \  The Autism RNs establish and maintain an interdisciplinary, multicenter research\
  \ forum for scientific collaboration and infrastructure building. They provide national\
  \ leadership in research to advance the evidence base on effective interventions\
  \ for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental\
  \ disabilities (ASD/DD) as they transition to adulthood across the lifespan. The\
  \ Research Networks develop guidelines for those interventions and disseminate information\
  \ related to such research and guidelines as authorized by the Autism CARES Act\
  \ of 2019 (Autism CARES Act).  The Autism SIIP Program supports focused research\
  \ on priority, emerging, and underdeveloped research areas in autism spectrum disorder\
  \ (ASD) and other development disabilities (DD), with a special focus on addressing\
  \ the needs of underserved populations. The Autism FIRST Program supports research\
  \ studies testing the implementation of new/innovative strategies that address critical\
  \ issues surrounding the health of children and adolescents with ASD. These studies\
  \ collect primary data to analyze public health trends in their chosen area of focus\
  \ within the Autism/DD, with awardees typically implementing randomized control\
  \ trials. The Autism SDAR Program supports secondary data analysis of existing publicly\
  \ available and accessible national databases and/or administrative records to determine\
  \ the evidence-based practices for interventions that improve the physical and behavioral\
  \ health of children and adolescents with ASD/DD, with a particular focus on addressing\
  \ barriers to identification, diagnosis, interventions and services among underserved\
  \ populations and for whom there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of interventions,\
  \ and limited access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for ASD/DD."
