objective: NIDCR extramural research provides research funds to support basic, translational,
  and clinical research in dental, oral, and craniofacial health and disease through
  grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts that support scientists working in
  institutions throughout the United States and internationally. Extramural programs
  plan, develop, and manage scientific priorities through portfolio analyses and consultation
  with stakeholders, encouraging the most promising discoveries and emerging technologies
  for rapid translation to clinical applications. The Integrative Biology and Infectious
  Diseases programs supports basic and translational research programs on oral microbiology;
  salivary biology and immunology; oral and salivary gland cancers; neuroscience of
  orofacial pain and temporomandibular disorders; mineralized tissue physiology; dental
  biomaterials; and tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The branch aims
  to accelerate progress in basic and translational research in these areas, and further
  stimulate the discovery pipeline based on clinical needs. The Translational Genomics
  Research programs supports basic and translational research in genetics, genomics,
  developmental biology, and data science toward the goal of improving dental, oral,
  and craniofacial health. The focus is on deciphering the genetic, molecular, and
  cellular mechanisms underlying dental, oral, and craniofacial development and anomalies.
  The Behavioral and Social Sciences Research programs supports basic and applied
  research to promote oral health, to prevent oral diseases and related disabilities,
  and to improve management of craniofacial conditions, disorders, and injury. The
  program prioritizes mechanistic research that contributes to a cumulative science
  of behavior change, to maximize the rigor, relevance, and dissemination of efficacious
  behavior change interventions. The Clinical Research programs supports patient-oriented,
  population, and community based research aimed at improving the dental, oral, and
  craniofacial health of the nation. The Center focuses on a variety of diseases and
  conditions through clinical trials, epidemiologic studies, practice-based research,
  the HIV/AIDS and oral health program, and studies of oral health disparities and
  inequities in all areas of NIDCR programmatic interest. The program encourages investigations
  that have the potential to translate findings into evidence-based clinical applications.
  The Research Training and Career Development extramural programs span the career
  stages of scientists, supporting research training and career development for PhD
  and dual degree DDS/DMD-PhD students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career, midcareer,
  and established investigators. The programs manage support for fellowships, research
  training grants, career development and career transition awards, NIH loan repayment
  awards, and diversity supplements to support research experiences for high school
  students through investigators. NIDCR participates in the Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The SBIR
  program is intended to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; to increase small business participation
  in Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation of
  socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation. The STTR program is intended
  to stimulate and foster scientific and technological innovation through cooperative
  research and development carried out between small business concerns and research
  institutions; to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived
  from Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation
  of socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation. Extramural programs are accountable
  for the efficient and effective use of taxpayer funds to support research on dental,
  oral, and craniofacial diseases and disorders and improving the oral health of all
  Americans. Extramural programs support research and research training to establish
  the foundation for scientific discoveries that include transparent and rigorous
  planning, priority setting, continuous and consistent reviews of progress, and  focus
  on the development of a diverse, highly skilled, and nimble workforce that can rapidly
  respond to scientific breakthroughs and public health challenges.  Extramural programs
  are accountable for the efficient and effective use of taxpayer funds to support
  research on dental, oral, and craniofacial diseases and  employ evaluation domains,
  from needs assessment and strategic planning to implementation and process evaluation,
  performance measurement, and outcomes and impact analysis to evaluate strategic
  objectives
