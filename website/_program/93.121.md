objective: NIDCR extramural research provides research funds to support basic, translational,
  and clinical research in dental, oral, and craniofacial health and disease through
  grants, cooperative agreements, including small business research through the Small
  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
  programs and contracts that support scientists working in institutions throughout
  the United States and internationally. Extramural programs plan, develop, and manage
  scientific priorities through portfolio analyses and consultation with stakeholders,
  encouraging the most promising discoveries and emerging technologies for rapid translation
  to clinical applications. The Integrative Biology and Infectious Diseases programs
  support basic and translational research programs on oral microbiology; salivary
  biology and immunology; oral and salivary gland cancers; neuroscience of orofacial
  pain and temporomandibular disorders; mineralized tissue physiology; dental biomaterials;
  and tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The branch aims to accelerate
  progress in basic and translational research in these areas, and further stimulate
  the discovery pipeline based on clinical needs. The Translational Genomics Research
  programs support basic and translational research in genetics, genomics, developmental
  biology, and data science toward the goal of improving dental, oral, and craniofacial
  health. The focus is on deciphering the genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms
  underlying dental, oral, and craniofacial development and anomalies. The Behavioral
  and Social Sciences Research programs support basic and applied research to promote
  oral health, to prevent oral diseases and related disabilities, and to improve management
  of craniofacial conditions, disorders, and injury. The program prioritizes mechanistic
  research that contributes to a cumulative science of behavior change, to maximize
  the rigor, relevance, and dissemination of efficacious behavior change interventions.
  The Clinical Research programs supports patient-oriented, population, and community
  based research aimed at improving the dental, oral, and craniofacial health of the
  nation. The Center focuses on a variety of diseases and conditions through clinical
  trials, epidemiologic studies, practice-based research, the HIV/AIDS and oral health
  program, and studies of oral health disparities and inequities in all areas of NIDCR
  programmatic interest. The program encourages investigations that have the potential
  to translate findings into evidence-based clinical applications. The Research Training
  and Career Development extramural programs span the career stages of scientists,
  supporting research training and career development for PhD and dual degree DDS/DMD-PhD
  students, postdoctoral scholars and early career, midcareer, and established investigators.
  The programs manage support for fellowships, research training grants, career development
  and career transition awards, NIH loan repayment awards, and diversity supplements
  to support research experiences for high school students through investigators.  Extramural
  programs are accountable for the efficient and effective use of taxpayer funds to
  support research on dental, oral, and craniofacial diseases and disorders and improving
  the oral health of all Americans. Extramural programs support research and research
  training to establish the foundation for scientific discoveries that include transparent
  and rigorous planning, priority setting, continuous and consistent reviews of progress,
  and  focus on the development of a diverse, highly skilled, and nimble workforce
  that can rapidly respond to scientific breakthroughs and public health challenges.  Extramural
  programs employ evaluation domains, from needs assessment and strategic planning
  to implementation and process evaluation, performance measurement, and outcomes
  and impact analysis to evaluate strategic objectives.
