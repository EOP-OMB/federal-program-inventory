objective: This program continues to advance the Department of the Interior’s priorities
  to address the climate crisis, restore balance on public lands and waters, advance
  environmental justice, and invest in a clean energy future.  One of the BLM's highest
  priorities is to promote ecosystem health and one of the greatest obstacles to achieving
  this goal is the rapid expansion of weeds across public lands. This program supports
  project funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Section 40804
  (b) Ecosystem Restoration.  These invasive plants can dominate and often cause permanent
  damage to natural plant communities. If not eradicated or controlled, noxious weeds
  will continue to jeopardize the health of public lands and to constrain the myriad
  activities that occur on them. These reforms allow the Bureau to realign time and
  resources to completing important on–the-groundwork. To encourage interested State
  and local governments and Federal agencies to work together to inventory, manage,
  restore, educate, reduce the spread of, and prevent the further invasion and establishment
  of noxious, invasive weeds, and other invasive species. These entities will develop
  and implement Integrated Pest Management Plans (IMPs) to develop and implement projects
  that foster consultation and cooperation among stakeholders, interested parties,
  and the public and to organize, finalize, and develop projects to implement IPM
  plans for noxious weeds or invasive species within a specific geographic area.

- description: No current data available. The Bureau of Land Management and Western
    States have worked together with private and non-Federal landowners to prevent,
    contain, and control the spread of invasive and noxious weeds and other invasive
    species.  Because invasive and noxious weeds and other invasive species “know
    no boundaries,” their introduction and spread from one owner's water and land
    to another, requires a joint effort to control, manage, and eradicate in order
    to reduce the invasive species adverse impacts on public and private lands and
    reduce costs to all land owners.
