objective: "This program continues to advance the Department of the Interior\u2019\
  s priorities to address the climate crisis, restore balance on public lands and\
  \ waters, advance environmental justice, and invest in a clean energy future.  One\
  \ of the BLM's highest priorities is to promote ecosystem health and one of the\
  \ greatest obstacles to achieving this goal is the rapid expansion of weeds across\
  \ public lands. This program supports project funded through the Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act, Section 40804 (b) Ecosystem Restoration.  These invasive\
  \ plants can dominate and often cause permanent damage to natural plant communities.\
  \ If not eradicated or controlled, noxious weeds will continue to jeopardize the\
  \ health of public lands and to constrain the myriad activities that occur on them.\
  \ These reforms allow the Bureau to realign time and resources to completing important\
  \ on\u2013the-groundwork. To encourage interested State and local governments and\
  \ Federal agencies to work together to inventory, manage, restore, educate, reduce\
  \ the spread of, and prevent the further invasion and establishment of noxious,\
  \ invasive weeds, and other invasive species. These entities will develop and implement\
  \ Integrated Pest Management Plans (IMPs) to develop and implement projects that\
  \ foster consultation and cooperation among stakeholders, interested parties, and\
  \ the public and to organize, finalize, and develop projects to implement IPM plans\
  \ for noxious weeds or invasive species within a specific geographic area."
