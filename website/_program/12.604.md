- description: As result of $2.1M in OEA investments in Fiscal Years 2015 and 2017,
    the Pennyrile Area Development District was able to inform and calm its residents
    over the potential economic impacts associated with the inactivation of the 159th
    Combat Aviation Brigade and the 4th Brigade Combat Team, resulting in the loss
    of 5,000 soldiers at Fort Campbell.  This effort enabled jurisdictions in Kentucky
    and Tennessee to inform small businesses of potential shifts in business patterns,
    keep local housing markets from over-reacting, develop a $7.7M U.S. Department
    of Labor workforce development program for dislocated personnel, and help the
    region embrace the Army’s basing actions.
