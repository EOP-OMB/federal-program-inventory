objective: The Office of The Biological Policy Staff (ISN/BPS) works to impede and
  roll back the threat of acquisition or use of biological weapons by state and non-state
  actors, oversees U.S. implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention, and manages
  a wide range of biological policy issues at the intersection of national security,
  public health, and science. Another key area is strengthening the operationalization
  of the United Nations Secretary-Generalâ€™s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged
  Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons to facilitate any potential investigations
  of the alleged use of biological weapons.
