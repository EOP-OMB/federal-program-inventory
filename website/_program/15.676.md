objective: "To provide experiential, education, and employment opportunities for youth\
  \ and veterans between the ages of 16 and 30, inclusive, or veterans age 35 or younger.\
  \ The intent of these education, career and leadership development programs is to\
  \ engage, educate, and employ youth participants in fields of natural resources\
  \ conservation and to advance the conservation and protection of natural and cultural\
  \ resources on eligible U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service managed or other eligible\
  \ Service lands (public lands, Indian lands, and Hawaiian homelands as defined by\
  \ USC 1722(3)). This Public Lands Corps Act program expands youth service opportunities\
  \ and serves important conservation and societal objectives. Individuals who are\
  \ economically, physically, or educationally disadvantaged may receive preference\
  \ for enrollment. This program includes the following subprograms: American Climate\
  \ Corps, Career Discovery Internship Program, Climate Conservation Corps, Directorate\
  \ Fellows Program, FWS Youth Corps Fire Management Program, FWS Youth Corps, Indian\
  \ Youth Service Corps, Maintenance Infrastructure Fellows Program, and Transportation\
  \ Fellows Program. \nThis program includes the following subprograms:\n\nCareer\
  \ Discovery Internship Program (CDIP):  Participants must be incoming college age\
  \ sophomores and juniors. Interns will attend a week-long orientation held in May\
  \ and then serve in summer internships tailored to various U.S. Fish and Wildlife\
  \ Service career tracks for 12 weeks at various sites around the country.\n\nCivilian\
  \ Climate Corps (CCC)/Climate Adaptation Fellowships: Fellowships are focused on\
  \ refining the framework of Climate-smart Infrastructure Management. Fellows should\
  \ be familiar with the concepts of landscape ecology, climate change science, natural\
  \ resource management, modeling or statistical programs and GIS.\n\nDirectorate\
  \ Fellows Program (DFP): The Directorate Fellows Resource Assistance Program (DFP)\
  \ is one of the Service’s Special Hiring Authorities. The DFP is a hiring program\
  \ with the explicit purpose, as legislated, to diversify the Service’s permanent\
  \ workforce as we engage students in natural and cultural resources work. The DFP\
  \ is a paid, 11-week summer Fellowship administered through a partner organization.\
  \ Directorate Fellows Program is a Resource Assistant Program under the Public Lands\
  \ Corps Act.\n\nIndian Youth Service Corps (IYSC): The intent of the IYSC Program\
  \ is to expand opportunities for Tribes to participate in Public Land Corps activities\
  \ and to provide a direct benefit to members of federally recognized Indian Tribes\
  \ or Alaska Native corporations. The IYSC Program will provide meaningful educational,\
  \ employment, and training opportunities to its participants through conservation\
  \ projects on eligible service land - public lands and Indian lands.\n\nMaintenance\
  \ and Infrastructure Fellows (MIFP): This program is starting its pilot year in\
  \ FY23 and is an implementation action of a Career Flow strategy focused on maintenance\
  \ and infrastructure professionals developed by the FWS National Wildlife Refuge\
  \ System’s Recruit Train Retain team. This effort was created in response to various\
  \ administration priorities including “mobilizing segments of the public citizenry\
  \ to accomplish deferred maintenance, repairs, and climate adaptation and resiliency\
  \ work” and “taking action on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA).”\n\
  Public Lands Transportation Fellows Program (PLTF): Fellowships will be provided\
  \ to outstanding masters and doctoral graduates in a transportation-related field.\
  \ Fellows work with staff at a region/field office facing a transportation issue\
  \ to facilitate a transportation planning or implementation goal. The assigned projects\
  \ assist in the development of transportation solutions that preserve valuable resources\
  \ and enhance visitor experience."
