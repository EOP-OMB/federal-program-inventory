- description: 'In FY2024, The Office of Minority Health (OMH) funded 69 demonstration
    projects under 8 initiatives designed to reduce health disparities. Through demonstration
    project grants, OMH seeks to advance evidence-informed, data-driven public health
    approaches to eliminate health disparities for racial and ethnic minority populations.
    Health disparities often result from structural systems and environments that
    present barriers to the availability and accessibility of accurate information,
    resources, and services. The accomplishments of OMH supported projects have contributed
    to improving health outcomes for individuals who face disproportionate challenges
    to achieving health often requires local or community-based social and supportive
    services that address adverse social determinants of health (SDOH). The August
    2024 Supplement Journal for the Poor and Underserved, a peer-reviewed publication,
    featured several of those projects. The supplement includes: two Brief Communications,
    five Research Papers, one Commentary, and 10 Reports from the Field. The awardee-developed
    articles introduce innovative approaches to assessing the impact of health disparities
    in geographic areas, engaging community health workers and other trusted messengers,
    improving health care access for individuals with limited English proficiency,
    and more. The efforts of these and many other OMH grant recipients contribute
    to the national pursuit of health equity for all Americans.'
