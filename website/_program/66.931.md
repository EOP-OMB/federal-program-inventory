objective: "To protect human health and the environment while advancing U.S. national\
  \ interests through international environmental collaboration. The Office of International\
  \ and Tribal Affairs (OITA) engages both bilaterally and through multilateral institutions\
  \ to improve international cooperation to prevent and address the transboundary\
  \ movement of pollution. OITA will engage with key priority countries to address\
  \ air pollution that contributes significant pollution to the domestic and international\
  \ environment. Strengthening environmental protection abroad so that it is on par\
  \ with practices in the U.S. helps build a level playing field for industry and\
  \ promotes opportunities for technologies and innovation and the agency\u2019s international\
  \ programs also play an important role in fulfilling national security and foreign\
  \ policy objectives. OITA will continue technical and policy assistance for global\
  \ and regional efforts to address international sources of harmful pollutants. OITA\
  \ will engage multilaterally and bilaterally to prevent and reduce marine litter,\
  \ an increasingly prominent global issue that can negatively impact domestic water\
  \ quality, tourism, industry and public health in the U.S. OITA works with NPMs\
  \ and Regional Offices to formulate U.S. international policies and to implement\
  \ EPA\u2019s international programs that provide policy and technical assistance\
  \ to other countries. OITA will continue to link anticipated and achieved outcomes\
  \ to the Agency\u2019s Strategic Goals.\n\nFunding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2022:\
  \  OITA will continue to strengthen its focus on prioritizing, allocating resources,\
  \ and managing assistance agreements to advance the Agency\u2019s Strategic Goals\
  \ and international priorities while maximizing limited resources most effectively\
  \ and efficiently. OITA protects human health and the environment while advancing\
  \ U.S. national interests through international environmental collaboration. Working\
  \ with the experts from EPA's other programs and regional offices, other government\
  \ agencies, and other nations and international organizations, OITA identifies international\
  \ environmental issues that may adversely impact the United States and helps to\
  \ design and implement technical and policy options to address them."
