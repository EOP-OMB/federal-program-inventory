objective: The Office of International and Tribal Affairs (OITA) engages both bilaterally
  and through multilateral institutions to improve international cooperation to prevent
  and address the transboundary movement of pollution. OITA will engage with key priority
  countries to address air pollution that contributes significant pollution to the
  domestic and international environment. Strengthening environmental protection abroad
  so that it is on par with practices in the U.S. helps build a level playing field
  for industry and promotes opportunities for technologies and innovation and the
  agency’s international programs also play an important role in fulfilling national
  security and foreign policy objectives. OITA will continue technical and policy
  assistance for global and regional efforts to address international sources of harmful
  pollutants. OITA will engage multilaterally and bilaterally to prevent and reduce
  marine litter, an increasingly prominent global issue that can negatively impact
  domestic water quality, tourism, industry and public health in the U.S. OITA works
  with NPMs and Regional Offices to formulate U.S. international policies and to implement
  EPA’s international programs that provide policy and technical assistance to other
  countries. OITA will continue to link anticipated and achieved outcomes to the Agency’s
  Strategic Goals.  In FY 2025, OITA will continue to strengthen its focus on prioritizing,
  allocating resources, and managing assistance agreements to advance the Agency’s
  Strategic Goals and international priorities while maximizing limited resources
  most effectively and efficiently. Working with the experts from EPA's other programs
  and regional offices, other government agencies, and other nations and international
  organizations, OITA will identify international environmental issues that may adversely
  impact the United States and help to design and implement technical and policy options
  to address them.

    to strengthen and enhance public participation practices and to provide partner
    countries with tools and resources on social inclusion and public participation.
    EPA trained participants representing governments, NGOs, academia, media, and
    international organizations in Central and South America, the Middle East and
    North Africa, West Africa, and Indonesia. EPA, in support of the Lead Paint Alliance,
    provided technical assistance to Kenya, Tanzania, and other East African countries
    that furthered development and promulgation of lead in paint laws in East Africa. '

- description: US leadership promoted the trilateral exploration of areas to improve
    the comparability of emissions via mitigation and adaptation projects, with the
    longer term view of adopting policies that will achieve each country’s climate
    goals, again illustrating the critical role played by the environment in any conversation
    on economic and social development.

- description: "Ineffective solid waste management leads to land-based and marine-based\
    \ litter, which can cause land and marine degradation. Under the U.S. and Central\
    \ America and Caribbean Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) EPA provided technical\
    \ assistance to some countries in the region to develop National Marine Litter\
    \ Action Plans (NMLAP). There are six CAFTA-DR countries members: Costa Rica,\
    \ Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. EPA helped\
    \ four CAFTA-DR countries develop their NMLAPs: Costa Rica, Dominican Republic,\
    \ El Salvador, and Guatemala. In addition, EPA also assisted Panama with the development\
    \ of its NMLAP. The objective of each NMLAP is to establish a roadmap for relevant\
    \ authorities in each country to begin to manage marine litter issues. As a result\
    \ of EPA’s technical exchange five countries in Central America and one nation\
    \ in the Caribbean are increasing marine litter awareness at a national and local\
    \ levels, working on solid waste management policies development and/or enforcement,\
    \ and involving the public in the decision-making process.  \n\nAs recommended\
    \ by EPA, the NMLAPs are structured in three sections. The first section addresses\
    \ the regulatory background and current situation regarding marine litter (international\
    \ and regional) and the current situation of marine litter in-country.  The second\
    \ section presents the analysis and identification of actions and strategic lines.\
    \ And, the third section presents the scope of the Plan and a strategic intervention,\
    \ as well as a proposal for sustainability, coordination for execution and follow-up,\
    \ monitoring, and evaluation."
