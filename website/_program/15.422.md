objective: "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides major economic and\
  \ energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers, States and the\
  \ American Indian community. The BOEM oversees the exploration and development of\
  \ oil, natural gas and other minerals and renewable energy alternatives on the Nation\u2019\
  s outer continental shelf. BOEM continues to look for better ways to serve the American\
  \ people and to ensure that the Nation receives the best value for its resources\
  \ now and into the future. The program not only supports decisions made within the\
  \ Department of the Interior, but also provides coastal States and local governments\
  \ with the information necessary to ensure that all stages of offshore energy and\
  \ mineral activities are conducted in a manner to protect both the human and natural\
  \ environments. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA)  Section 1346 mandates\
  \ the conduct of environmental and socioeconomic studies needed for the assessment\
  \ and management of environmental impacts on the human, marine, and coastal environments\
  \ which may be affected by oil and gas or other mineral development. OCSLA Section\
  \ 1345 authorizes the use of cooperative agreements with affected States to meet\
  \ the requirements of OCSLA, including sharing of information, joint utilization\
  \ of available expertise, formation of joint monitoring arrangements to carry out\
  \ applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and stipulations relevant to outer\
  \ continental shelf operations both onshore and offshore."
