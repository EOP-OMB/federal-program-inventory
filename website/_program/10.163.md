objective: 'The Federal Seed Program prevents mislabeled seed from moving in interstate
  commerce by providing for random sampling of seeds to insure accurate labeling of
  seed characteristics. The Pesticide Data Program works with participating States
  to collect and analyze data on pesticide use and residue levels for selected commodities
  in the nation''s food supply. This program provides statistically based data to
  Federal agencies for use in making policy decisions for regulatory and educational
  purposes.  Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) is a labeling law that requires retailers
  (ie grocery stores) to notify their customers of the country of origin for covered
  commodities: muscle cut and ground meats for lamb, goat, and chicken; wild and farm-raised
  fish and shellfish (including method of production); fresh and frozen fruits and
  vegetables; peanuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, and ginseng.  The National Bioengineered
  Food Disclosure Standard (NBFDS) requires food manufacturers, importers and other
  entities that label foods for retail sale to disclose information about bioengineered
  (BE) foods and BE food ingredients.  This program requires AMS regulatory authorities
  to respond to stakeholder inquiries, monitor complaints and enforce labeling requirements.  An
  annual update is required to the List of Bioengineered Foods (List) that tells regulated
  entities which foods they must keep records for and which foods may require BE disclosures.
  This program provides scientific fellowships that monitor the development of new
  technologies and contributes to BE policy decisions.'
