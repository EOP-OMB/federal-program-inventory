objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest
  earned on State and local government bonds used to finance multifamily rental housing
  projects to be tax-exempt.
