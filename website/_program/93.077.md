objective: 'The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA) provides the
  authority to regulate tobacco product manufacturing, distribution and marketing.
  Regulatory research will provide the scientific evidence to guide the implementation
  of this authority. Research areas include: 1) tobacco product composition and design
  2), the toxicity of tobacco products, 3) addiction and abuse liability of tobacco
  products, 4) the short- and long-term health effects of tobacco products, 5) peopleâ€™s
  behaviors related to tobacco product use and characteristics, 6) communicating to
  the public regarding nicotine and the health effects of tobacco products, 7) the
  influences of tobacco marketing on susceptibility and tobacco product use, and 8)
  the potential or actual impact of FDA regulatory actions. The strategic priorities
  for these research areas can be found at https://www.fda.gov/tobaccoproducts/research/research-priorities'
