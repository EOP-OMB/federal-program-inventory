  technical support to enable tribal governments and trust land managers to better
  understand potential impacts and vulnerabilities of communities, ecosystems and
  built systems to climate-related change, to enable them to develop information and
  tools to support planning and decision making, to implement strategies that improve
  the preparedness and resilience of communities in the face of a changing climate
  and address the potential for increased peak weather events. The program also enables
  tribal participation in ocean and coastal planning.
