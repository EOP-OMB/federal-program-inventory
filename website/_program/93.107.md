  primary care workforce representative of the communities served; (2) to improve
  health workforce distribution through the nation, particularly among rural and underserved
  areas and population; and (3) to develop and maintain a healthcare workforce that
  is prepared to deliver high quality care in a transforming health care delivery
  system with emphasis on rural and underserved areas and communities.'

    1,560 unique continuing education courses that were delivered to 150,349 participating
    professionals nationwide, of whom46 percent were concurrently employed in medically
    underserved communities (MUC). They also enhanced or developed 2,972 courses and

    care settings; 70 percent were located in medically underserves communities; and
    45 percent were in rural areas.'
