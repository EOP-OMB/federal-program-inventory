objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law interest
  earned on State and local Government bonds issued to finance the construction of
  facilities used by private nonprofit educational institutions is not taxed.
