objective: MFP provides assistance to producers with commodities that have been significantly
  impacted by actions of foreign governments resulting in the loss of traditional
  exports. The imposition of tariffs by other countries on U.S. agricultural products,
  among other actions, are disrupting marketing of agricultural commodities and are
  outside of the control of the agricultural producers who are being negatively impacted.
