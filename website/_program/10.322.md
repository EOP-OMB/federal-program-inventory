objective: 'The purpose of the DEG program is to strengthen the capacity of institutions
  of higher education in insular areas to carry out resident instruction, curriculum,
  and teaching programs in the food and agricultural sciences through distance education
  technology. Projects funded by the DEG program support the creation, adaptation,
  and adoption of learning materials and teaching strategies to operationalize what
  we know about how students learn. Many of these concepts are identified in the National
  Research Council’s publication, “How People Learn.” DEG-funded projects shall also
  focus on imparting both technical knowledge as well employability skills such as
  communication, teamwork, and problem solving. These concepts can be found in the
  publication: https://www.aplu.org/projects-and-initiatives/agriculture-human-sciences-and-natural-resources/employability-skills-in-agriculture/index.html.'
