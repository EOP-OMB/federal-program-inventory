  \ of higher education in insular areas to carry out resident instruction, curriculum,\
  \ and teaching programs in the food and agricultural sciences through distance education\
  \ technology. Projects funded by the DEG program support the creation, adaptation,\
  \ and adoption of learning materials and teaching strategies to operationalize what\
  \ we know about how students learn. Many of these concepts are identified in the\
  \ National Research Council\u2019s publication, \u201CHow People Learn.\u201D DEG-funded\
  \ projects shall also focus on imparting both technical knowledge as well employability\
