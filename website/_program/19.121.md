    all across the globe. One of CSO's most successful programs awarded in FY16 supported
    the peace process in Colombia. CSO's awardee implemented a barometer program that

    and post-accord implementation monitoring capabilities with the goal of improving
    Colombia's ability to successfully implement a peace agreement, once reached.

    on nearly all of CSO's thematic focus areas - Peace Process Support, Electoral
    Violence, Countering Violent Extremism, Transitional Security, and Atrocity Prevention.
    One standout program will identify key indicators of violent extremism, allow
    for monitoring the effectiveness and impact of CVE interventions, and fill critical
    gaps in understanding of drives and resiliencies of VE in six target countries.
