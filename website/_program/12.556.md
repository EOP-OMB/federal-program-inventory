objective: "The DoDEA Educational Partnership Grant Program provide resources for\
  \ local education agencies [LEAs] to meet the academic, social and emotional needs\
  \ of the highly mobile military-connected students in their community. The Grant\
  \ Program specifically provides resources to military-connected LEAs to develop\
  \ and implement projects that are designed to:\n•\tEngage students where disciplines\
  \ converge, including programs that meaningfully integrate science, technology,\
  \ mathematics, and engineering (STEM) subjects as well as other disciplines such\
  \ as Career and Technical Education (CTE), arts & humanities.\n•\tDesigning innovative\
  \ remote learning experiences to teach literacy, mathematics, computer science,\
  \ and/or other CTE courses.\n•\tDevelop partnerships or consortia approaches to\
  \ implement education and outreach programs with a holistic approach to understanding\
  \ real-world applications.\n•\tFill gaps in schools that lack necessary infrastructure\
  \ through innovative programming and/or novel interventions to address student achievement\
  \ gaps in any curricular subject.\n\nOR progress World Languages for military-connected\
  \ student through one on the following: \n1)\tEstablish and implement programs that\
  \ showcase a meaningful integration of world language(s) across subject areas. Projects\
  \ under this scope would include world language immersion or partial world language\
  \ immersion of any of the languages included on the DoD SLL (Appendix D) and/or\
  \ ASL.\n2)\tEstablish and implement an exploratory pilot program that seeks to create\
  \ new world language experiences for students. For example, this type of project\
  \ may link native speakers of languages other than English within the LEA with the\
  \ target schools in order to promote two-way language learning. The language used\
  \ for this scope must be included on the DoD SLL (Appendix D) and/or ASL.\n3)\t\
  Improve or expand content-based instruction in the target school’s current world\
  \ language program of one or more of the languages included on the DoD SLL (Appendix\
  \ D) and/or ASL.\n4)\tEffectively use technology, such as computer-assisted instruction\
  \ or distance (virtual) learning, to establish or expand course offerings of one\
  \ or more world languages included on the DoD SLL (Appendix D) and/or ASL."

- description: In Fiscal Year 2022 DoDEA awarded 11 grants to school districts that
    provides solutions that will establish, improve, or expand world language study
    for Pre-K-12 public school students their district.  For this effort, world language
    is defined as American Sign Language (ASL) and/or any of the languages included
    on the DoD Strategic Language List (SLL) as defined in DoD Directive 5160.41E,
    Defense Language, Regional Expertise, and Culture Program. All awarded schools
    had at least a 10 percent or greater military-connected student enrollment for
    that school year.  Additionally, all awarded school districts are members of a
    school district which currently hosts a unit of the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
    Corps (JROTC) in one of their local high schools and all provided a professional
    development component to teachers to build their capacity in a specific world
    language.

- description: "In FY2023 - DoDEA awarded 54 public school districts with grants,\
    \ an investment of over $73M.  More than 80% of the active DoDEA grants, incorporate\
    \ a STEM goal and/or strategy.  This includes initiatives such as introducing\
    \ students to STEM careers, promoting STEM among various subgroups, and enhancing\
    \ engagement in STEM participation and achievement. It’s worth mentioning that\
    \ DoDEA has granted 15 specific STEM grants in the field of Cybersecurity/Coding,\
    \ with 7 for Cybersecurity and 8 for Coding.\n\nThe most prevalent academic strategies\
    \ support of STEM initiatives involves in-class curriculum and instructional support.\
    \ This includes the implementation of project-based learning in STEM classes,\
    \ the introduction of AVID and AP courses, the adoption of new curricula, and\
    \ the use of innovative teaching methods. These strategies are being employed\
    \ by over 98.80% of active grants with a focus on STEM goals, impacting more than\
    \ 300,000 students.\nDoDEA STEM-funded grants have resulted in a multitude of\
    \ accomplishments and outcomes such as improvements in student performance (primarily\
    \ in academic areas of math and science), and the procurement and development\
    \ of technology and educational resources, such as makerspace kits, STEM software,\
    \ virtual learning enrichment, and mobile labs, all of which are aimed at enhancing\
    \ student achievement.\n\nSuccess factors for DoDEA STEM-funded grants include:\
    \ \n•\tProviding a “playlist” of STEM professional learning opportunities for\
    \ broader access (e.g., new teachers, experienced teachers, etc.) and providing\
    \ time, compensation, certification, and/or CEU credit for teachers.\n•\tUnderstanding\
    \ and communicating how Cyber, Code, Esports, STEM are interrelated and impactful\
    \ through the development of common language. \n•\tProviding professional learning\
    \ with time/activities for relevant application/integration; using a train the\
    \ trainer model to build teacher capacity. \n•\tProviding STEM specialists/coaches\
    \ at the building level to provide “just-in-time” support. \n•\tAffordable and\
    \ accessible STEM summer camp opportunities for students."
