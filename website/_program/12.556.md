objective: "The DoDEA Educational Partnership Grant Program provide resources for\
  \ local education agencies [LEAs] to meet the academic, social and emotional needs\
  \ of the highly mobile military-connected students in their community. The Grant\
  \ Program specifically provides resources to military-connected LEAs to develop\
  \ and implement projects that are designed to:\n\u2022\tEngage students where disciplines\
  \ converge, including programs that meaningfully integrate science, technology,\
  \ mathematics, and engineering (STEM) subjects as well as other disciplines such\
  \ as Career and Technical Education (CTE), arts & humanities.\n\u2022\tDesigning\
  \ innovative remote learning experiences to teach literacy, mathematics, computer\
  \ science, and/or other CTE courses.\n\u2022\tDevelop partnerships or consortia\
  \ approaches to implement education and outreach programs with a holistic approach\
  \ to understanding real-world applications.\n\u2022\tFill gaps in schools that lack\
  \ necessary infrastructure through innovative programming and/or novel interventions\
  \ to address student achievement gaps in any curricular subject.\n\nOR progress\
  \ World Languages for military-connected student through one on the following: \n\
  1)\tEstablish and implement programs that showcase a meaningful integration of world\
  \ language(s) across subject areas. Projects under this scope would include world\
  \ language immersion or partial world language immersion of any of the languages\
  \ included on the DoD SLL (Appendix D) and/or ASL.\n2)\tEstablish and implement\
  \ an exploratory pilot program that seeks to create new world language experiences\
  \ for students. For example, this type of project may link native speakers of languages\
  \ other than English within the LEA with the target schools in order to promote\
  \ two-way language learning. The language used for this scope must be included on\
  \ the DoD SLL (Appendix D) and/or ASL.\n3)\tImprove or expand content-based instruction\
  \ in the target school\u2019s current world language program of one or more of the\
  \ languages included on the DoD SLL (Appendix D) and/or ASL.\n4)\tEffectively use\
  \ technology, such as computer-assisted instruction or distance (virtual) learning,\
  \ to establish or expand course offerings of one or more world languages included\
  \ on the DoD SLL (Appendix D) and/or ASL."
