objective: 'To assist States, tribal governments and local governments in supporting
  actions that reduce or eliminate the long-term risk of flood damage to residential
  properties insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that meet the
  definition of severe repetitive loss property, and to reduce losses to the National
  Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) by funding projects that result in the greatest savings
  to the NFIF in the shortest time period. This grant program supports the Mitigate
  component of the Presidential Preparedness Directive 8 (PPD-8) in the following
  ways: by providing funding to states and communities that promotes Long-Term Vulnerability
  Reduction through various mitigation measures including by elevating at-risk homes
  or removing structures from flood hazard areas. Overall, this program also supports
  Community Resilience by reducing the need for emergency services in flood-prone
  areas of the community.'
