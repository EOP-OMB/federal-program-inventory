- description: 'Projects supported in FY 2016 will help communities build the environmental
    literacy necessary for resilience to extreme weather events and other environmental
    hazards. Communities have made clear their need for this type of project. The
    2016 competition received 170 proposals from 40 states, the District of Columbia,
    and 3 U.S. Territories (including Puerto Rico), with a request of more than $77
    million. The following audiences and institution types were served by NOAA’s mission-related
    educational awards in FY 2016; cumulative numbers of learners are approximate:
    4 million Pre-K to 12 students; 13,000 formal and informal educators; 45 million
    adult learners in informal science education contexts; more than 150 institutions
    advanced NOAA’s mission to enhance awareness and understanding of Earth systems
    science through NOAA ELP-supported formal (K-12) and informal education initiatives
    that both inspire and prepare people to make the best social, economic, and environmental
    decisions.'
