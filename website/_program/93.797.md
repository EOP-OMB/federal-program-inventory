objective: "The Expanding Access to Women’s Health Grant Program will provide a funding\
  \ source to States for activities related to planning and implementing the market\
  \ reforms and consumer protections under the below-listed provisions of Part A of\
  \ Title XVII of the PHS Act to enhance and expand access to reproductive health\
  \ and maternal health coverage and services.\n\nI. Section 2707 – Comprehensive\
  \ Health Insurance Coverage (Essential Health Benefits Package) \nII. Section 2713\
  \ – Coverage of Preventive Health Services\n\nThese pre-selected market reforms\
  \ and consumer protections under Part A of Title XXVII of the PHS Act were selected\
  \ because of their connection to reproductive health and maternal health coverage\
  \ and services and the positive impact that CMS anticipates this funding will have\
  \ on enhancing and expanding access to reproductive and maternal health coverage\
  \ and services for women in each awardee State.\nCMS will award grants, through\
  \ a competitive process. CMS will issue second-year funding via a non-competing\
  \ continuation award."
