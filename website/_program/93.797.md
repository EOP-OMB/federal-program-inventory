objective: The Expanding Access to Women’s Health Grant Program will provide a funding
  source to States for activities related to planning and implementing the market
  reforms and consumer protections under the below-listed provisions of Part A of
  Title XXVII of the PHS Act to enhance and expand access to reproductive health and
  maternal health coverage and services. I. Section 2707 – Comprehensive Health Insurance
  Coverage (Essential Health Benefits Package) II. Section 2713 – Coverage of Preventive
  Health Services These pre-selected market reforms and consumer protections under
  Part A of Title XXVII of the PHS Act were selected because of their connection to
  reproductive health and maternal health coverage and services and the positive impact
  that CMS anticipates this funding will have on enhancing and expanding access to
  reproductive and maternal health coverage and services for women in each awardee
  State. CMS will award grants, through a competitive process.
