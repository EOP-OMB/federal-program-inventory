objective: 'The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for Workers Program is a federal
  entitlement program that assists workers impacted by foreign trade. Through the
  provision of a number of employment-related benefits and services, the TAA Program
  provides trade-affected workers with opportunities to obtain the support, resources,
  skills, and credentials they need to return to the workforce in a good job in an
  in-demand industry. TAA Program services include: training, employment and case
  management services, job search allowances, relocation allowances, wage supplements
  for workers aged 50 and older, and income support in the form of Trade Readjustment
  Allowances (TRA).'

- description: 'In FY 2019 (October 1, 2018 – September 30, 2019), 1,235 petitions
    were filed, a 3 percent decrease from FY 2018. An estimated 88,001 workers became
    eligible to apply for TAA, up 14 percent from the previous year, and 28,348 participants
    received benefits and services, down 18 percent from the previous year. Performance
    remained at a 5-year high in FY 2019 with 77 percent of TAA participants obtaining
    new employment within 6 months of completing the program. While 53 percent of
    FY 2019 TAA petitions were from the manufacturing industry, 62 percent of participants
    who exited the program were re-employed in non-manufacturing industry sectors,
    coinciding with the general U.S. economic trend of growth in non-manufacturing
    industry employment.


    Of the 8,251 TAA exiters who received training in FY 2019, approximately 75 percent
    (6,162) completed training and about 88 percent (5,446) of training completers
    received a credential. The fourth-quarter employment rate of those participants
    who completed training and received a credential were higher than those participants
    who did not, continuing a multi-year trend.'
  year: '2019'
- description: The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program works. Of the 6,301 TAA
    exiters who received training in FY 2020, approximately 76 percent (4,762) completed
    training and about 91 percent (4,324) of training completers received a credential.
    The fourth-quarter employment rate of those participants who completed training
    and received a credential were higher than those participants who did not, continuing
    a multi-year trend. These performance results demonstrate that even during a year
    of an economic crisis such as FY 2020, the TAA Program is vastly relevant in providing
    important benefits and services to help trade-affected workers obtain reemployment.
  year: '2020'
- description: 'In FY 2021, 801 petitions were certified, a nearly 4-

    percent increase from FY 2020. An estimated 107,454 workers became eligible to
    apply for TAA, up approximately 12 percent from the previous year. Of the 5,296
    TAA exiting participants, or “exiters”, who received training in FY 2021, approximately
    79 percent (4,156) completed training, the highest level in five years. More than
    72 percent of training participants received a credential within a year of exiting
    the program, which is also the highest level in five years. The fourth quarter
    employment rate of those participants who completed training was higher than that
    of participants who did not, continuing a multi-year trend.

    These performance results demonstrate that even during a global pandemic, the
    TAA Program is an especially important part of the workforce system and continues
    to provide important benefits and

    services to help trade-affected workers obtain reemployment.


    TAA Participants age 30 and under experienced a 101 percent wage replacement rate
    after TAA Program completion.'

- description: "o\tIn FY 2022 (October 1, 2021 – September 30, 2022), 168 petitions\
    \ were certified, a nearly 80-percent decrease from FY 2021, and an estimated\
    \ 25,099 workers became eligible to apply for TAA, down approximately 77 percent\
    \ from the previous year; both of these decreases are due to program reversion\
    \ and termination in FY 2022.  These decreases are directly attributable to the\
    \ implementation of the reversion and termination provisions of the Trade Adjustment\
    \ Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA 2015).  Some performance results\
    \ were below previous 5-year high levels achieved in FY 2020 but improved over\
    \ COVID-19 impacted FY 2021 results with approximately 71 percent of TAA participants\
    \ obtaining new employment within 6 months of exiting the program.  Median Earnings\
    \ (ME) reached 5-year high levels in FY 2022 with earnings nearly 15 percent higher\
    \ than FY 2021.\no\tWage replacement was also noteworthy for FY 2022 with post\
    \ participation earnings at 96.1 percent of pre-participation employment earnings\
    \ – the highest in known history of the TAA Program.  Also worth noting is wage\
    \ replacement for TAA participants aged 30 or under at 122.7 percent, meaning\
    \ post TAA participation they earned 22.7 percent more than pre-participation\
    \ earnings.  Similarly, TAA participants aged 30 through 39 and 40 through 49\
    \ also earned after participating in TAA than their pre-participation employment\
    \ earnings.  With many highly skilled jobs unable to be filled due to the workforce\
    \ lacking the necessary training or skills, the TAA Program and its vital training\
    \ benefits and services is an essential part of the workforce system and if reauthorized,\
    \ will continue to provide important training benefits and services to help trade-affected\
    \ workers obtain reemployment for the future."

- description: 'Since 1974, more than 5 million American workers have been served
    by the TAA Program. In FY 2023 (October 1, 2022 – September 30, 2023), States
    and other parties continued to submit petitions to the Department even though
    no investigations could be conducted. During this

    timeframe, an additional 387 petitions were submitted, covering an estimated 71,481
    workers. Petitions have continued to be submitted in FY 2024. In FY 2023, approximately
    76.7 percent of TAA participants obtained

    new employment within 6 months of exiting the program. Median Earnings reached
    historic high levels in FY 2023 with reported earnings nearly 23 percent higher
    than in FY 2019. Wage replacement was also noteworthy for FY 2023, with post-participation
    earnings at 106.5 percent of pre-participation employment earnings – the highest
    in the history of the TAA Program. Even more impressive, wage replacement for
    TAA participants aged 30 or younger was at 132.8 percent. This means that, post-TAA
    participation, these workers earned 32.8 percent more than their pre-participation
    earnings.'
