objective: The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for Workers Program is a federal
  entitlement program that assists workers impacted by foreign trade. Through the
  provision of a number of employment-related benefits and services, the TAA Program
  provides trade-affected workers with opportunities to obtain the support, resources,
  skills, and credentials they need to return to the workforce in a good job in an
  in-demand industry. The program services include training, employment and case management
  services, job search allowances, relocation allowances, wage supplements for workers
  aged 50 and older, and Trade Readjustment Allowances (TRA).
