objective: The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for Workers Program is a federal
  entitlement program that assists workers impacted by foreign trade. Through the
  provision of a number of employment-related benefits and services, the TAA Program
  provides trade-affected workers with opportunities to obtain the support, resources,
  skills, and credentials they need to return to the workforce in a good job in an
  in-demand industry. The program services include training, employment and case management
  services, job search allowances, relocation allowances, wage supplements for workers
  aged 50 and older, and Trade Readjustment Allowances (TRA).

results:
- description: "o\tIn FY 2022 (October 1, 2021 \u2013 September 30, 2022), 168 petitions\
    \ were certified, a nearly 80-percent decrease from FY 2021, and an estimated\
    \ 25,099 workers became eligible to apply for TAA, down approximately 77 percent\
    \ from the previous year; both of these decreases are due to program reversion\
    \ and termination in FY 2022.  These decreases are directly attributable to the\
    \ implementation of the reversion and termination provisions of the Trade Adjustment\
    \ Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA 2015).  Some performance results\
    \ were below previous 5-year high levels achieved in FY 2020 but improved over\
    \ COVID-19 impacted FY 2021 results with approximately 71 percent of TAA participants\
    \ obtaining new employment within 6 months of exiting the program.  Median Earnings\
    \ (ME) reached 5-year high levels in FY 2022 with earnings nearly 15 percent higher\
    \ than FY 2021.\no\tWage replacement was also noteworthy for FY 2022 with post\
    \ participation earnings at 96.1 percent of pre-participation employment earnings\
    \ \u2013 the highest in known history of the TAA Program.  Also worth noting is\
    \ wage replacement for TAA participants aged 30 or under at 122.7 percent, meaning\
    \ post TAA participation they earned 22.7 percent more than pre-participation\
    \ earnings.  Similarly, TAA participants aged 30 through 39 and 40 through 49\
    \ also earned after participating in TAA than their pre-participation employment\
    \ earnings.  With many highly skilled jobs unable to be filled due to the workforce\
    \ lacking the necessary training or skills, the TAA Program and its vital training\
    \ benefits and services is an essential part of the workforce system and if reauthorized,\
    \ will continue to provide important training benefits and services to help trade-affected\
    \ workers obtain reemployment for the future."
