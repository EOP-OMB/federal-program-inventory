objective: 'The purpose of the Title V State SRAE program is to provide messages to
  youth that normalizes the optimal health behavior of avoiding non-marital sexual
  activity. Title V State SRAE is a prevention education program targeted to youth
  ages 10 to 19. Programmatic services must be medically accurate and complete; age-appropriate;
  based on adolescent learning and developmental theories for the age group receiving
  the education; and culturally appropriate, recognizing the experiences of youth
  from diverse communities, backgrounds, and experiences. Education on sexual risk
  avoidance must address each of the following topics: (A) The holistic individual
  and societal benefits associated with personal responsibility, self-regulation,
  goalsetting, healthy decision making, and a focus on the future. (B) The advantage
  of refraining from non-marital sexual activity to improve the future prospects and
  physical and emotional health of youth. (C) The increased likelihood of avoiding
  poverty when youth attain self-sufficiency and emotional maturity before engaging
  in sexual activity. (D) The foundational components of healthy relationships and
  their impact on the formation of healthy marriages and safe and stable families.
  (E) How other youth risk behaviors, such as drug and alcohol usage, increase the
  risk for teen sex.  (F) How to resist and avoid, and receive help regarding, sexual
  coercion and dating violence, recognizing that even with consent teen sex remains
  a youth risk behavior.'
