objective: The purpose of the Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) program
  is to promote economic and social self-sufficiency for American Indians, Alaska
  Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native American Pacific Islanders from American Samoa,
  Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The SEDS program supports
  the principle that social and economic development are interrelated and essential
  for the development of thriving Native communities. The Administration for Native
  Americans (ANA) is interested in supporting community-driven projects designed to
  grow local economies, increase the capacity of tribal governments, strengthen families,
  preserve Native cultures, and increase self-sufficiency and community well-being.
  ANA may use the SEDS program for special initiatives to meet emerging needs in Native
  communities. The current special initiative is Social and Economic Development Strategies
  for Alaska (SEDS-AK).  The purpose of the SEDS-AK program is specifically aimed
  to promote social and economic self-sufficiency for Alaska Natives. The SEDS-AK
  program provides funding for projects designed to enhance governance and programmatic
  management capacity for Alaska Native villages to empower them to promote social
  and economic self-sufficiency for Alaska Natives.  ANA funding is meant for projects
  that identify direct, measurable outcomes which will be achieved within the proposed
  project period.
