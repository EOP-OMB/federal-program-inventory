objective: "The objectives of these discretionary programs include: (1) building capacity\
  \ for the placement of refugees in locations with good opportunities and providing\
  \ specialized case management for vulnerable cases; (2) assisting low-income refugees\
  \ with matching funds for individual development accounts and with financial literacy\
  \ classes; (3) providing micro-credit to refugees interested in starting new businesses\
  \ but unable to access commercial sources of capital; (4) providing agricultural\
  \ training and opportunities to improve the local food systems for refugee farmers;\
  \ (5) promoting integration; (6) assisting refugees to achieve career advancement;\
  \ (7) assisting refugees to open family based child care businesses; (8) providing\
  \ technical assistance to the refugee service providers; (9) providing employer\
  \ based educational and language acquisition opportunities; and (10) and supporting\
  \ the mental health needs of refugees affected by trauma This listing includes:\
  \ Refugee Individual Development Accounts (IDA), Refugee Agricultural Partnership\
  \ Project (RAPP), Refugee Family Child Care Microenterprise Development (RFCCMED),\
  \ Refugee Career Pathways (RCP), Refugee Microenterprise Development (MED), Preferred\
  \ Communities (PC), Ethnic Community Self-Help (ECSH), Refugee Technical Assistance\
  \ Program (RTAP), Services for Afghan Survivors Impacted by Combat (SASIC), (the\
  \ soon-to-be launched) Support for Trauma-Affected Refugees (STAR) and Employer\
  \ Engagement Program (EEP). Through the Refugee IDA Program recipients manage IDAs\
  \ for low-income refugee participants. Eligible refugee participants will open and\
  \ contribute systematically to IDAs for specified Asset Goals. The RAPP recipients\
  \ develop strategies that incorporate agriculture and food systems to improve the\
  \ livelihoods and economic self-sufficiency of refugee families, with particular\
  \ emphasis on newly arrived refugees. RAPP requirements are to provide: 1) access\
  \ to land; 2) farming production; 3) training and technical assistance (TA); and\
  \ 4) coordination with the refugee resettlement community. The RFCCMED Program enables\
  \ recipients to help refugees to achieve self-sufficiency by establishing small\
  \ family child care businesses. The program provides refugee participants with training\
  \ and TA; assists refugee participants in navigating the child care licensing process;\
  \ and provides direct financial assistance as needed to enable participants to prepare\
  \ their homes for child care business operation. Through the RCP Program, ORR provides\
  \ funding to enable refugees to obtain self-sufficiency by obtaining the means to\
  \ secure professional or skilled employment drawing upon previously acquired knowledge,\
  \ skills, and experience. The overall goal of the Refugee MED Program is to assist\
  \ refugees to become economically self-sufficient by 1) assisting refugees to establish\
  \ microenterprise businesses through the provision of MED loans, Training and TA,\
  \ and 2) assisting refugees in building credit history and/or repairing their credit\
  \ score. The goal of the ECSH Program is to support Ethnic Community-Based Organizations\
  \ (ECBOs) in providing refugee populations with critical services to assist them\
  \ in becoming integrated members of American society. An ECBO as a non-profit organization\
  \ whose board of directors is comprised of at least 60 percent current and/or former\
  \ refugees. The PC Program supports the resettlement of especially vulnerable refugee\
  \ groups at resettlement sites that PC service providers designate as “Preferred\
  \ Communities.” The term refers to locations that offer excellent opportunities\
  \ for the integration and resettlement of the most vulnerable newly and recently\
  \ arrived refugees. The RTAP creates a national one-stop source or hub for refugee\
  \ TA and training. This national hub provides coordinated, innovative TA and training\
  \ to ORR-funded state refugee programs and ORR funded refugee service providers,\
  \ filling gaps where no other such TA and training exists. The goal of the Employer\
  \ Engagement Program (EEP) will be to develop relationships with employers to provide\
  \ ESL and on-the-job learning opportunities for refugees. \nThe new Services for\
  \ Afghan Survivors Impacted by Combat (SASIC) is a one-time program with a single\
  \ budget period of 36 months. The goals of the Program are to help newly arrived\
  \ Afghans eligible under the Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act (ASA) overcome\
  \ severe, pervasive, and long-lasting combat-related trauma and to facilitate their\
  \ achievement of sustained physical, social, emotional, and economic well-being.\
  \  ORR’s new Support for Trauma-Affected Refugees (STAR) Program will be launched\
  \ in early 2024. The goals of the STAR Program are the integration and successful\
  \ achievement of sustained physical, social, emotional, and economic well-being\
  \ of underserved refugees whose experience of trauma is impeding their ability to\
  \ function effectively at home, school, work or in social settings."
