objective: 'The objectives of these discretionary programs are: (1) build capacity
  for refugees in locations with good opportunities and providing specialized case
  management for vulnerable individuals; (2) assist low-income refugees through financial
  literacy education and with matching funds for individual development accounts ;
  (3) provide micro-credit to refugees interested in starting new businesses but unable
  to access commercial capital; (4) provide agricultural training and opportunities
  to improve local food systems for refugee farmers; (5) promote integration; (6)
  assist refugees with career advancement; (7) assist refugees to open family based
  child care businesses; (8) provide technical assistance to refugee service providers;
  (9) provide employer based educational and language acquisition opportunities; (10)
  support the mental health needs of refugees affected by trauma; and (11) build refugee
  leadership through sharing lived experience. This list includes: Refugee Individual
  Development Accounts (IDA), Refugee Agricultural Partnership Project (RAPP), Refugee
  Family Child Care Microenterprise Development (RFCCMED), Refugee Career Pathways
  (RCP), Refugee Microenterprise Development (MED), Preferred Communities (PC), Ethnic
  Community Self-Help (ECSH), Refugee Technical Assistance Program (RTAP), Services
  for Afghan Survivors Impacted by Combat (SASIC), Support for Trauma-Affected Refugees
  (STAR), Employer Engagement Program (EEP), National Refugee Children and Youth Resilience
  (NRCYR) Program, and National Refugee Leadership and Lived Experience Council (NRLLEC)
  Program. Through the IDA Program, recipients manage IDAs for low-income refugee
  participants. Eligible refugee participants will open and contribute systematically
  to IDAs for Asset Goals. RAPP recipients develop strategies that incorporate agriculture
  to improve the livelihoods and self-sufficiency of refugee families. RAPP provides:
  1) access to land; 2) farming production; 3) training and technical assistance (TA);
  and 4) coordination with the refugee resettlement community. RFCCMED helps refugees
  achieve self-sufficiency by establishing small family childcare businesses. The
  program provides training and TA; assists in navigating the licensing process; and
  provides direct financial assistance to enable participants to prepare their homes
  for childcare business. RCP enables refugees to obtain self-sufficiency and secure
  professional or skilled employment drawing upon previously acquired knowledge, skills,
  and experience. MED assists refugees to become economically self-sufficient by 1)
  establishing microenterprise businesses through MED loans, training and TA, and
  2) assisting refugees in building or repairing credit history. ECSH supports Ethnic
  Community-Based Organizations (ECBOs) in providing refugees services to assist them
  in becoming integrated members of American society. An ECBO is a non-profit organization
  whose board of directors is at least 60 percent current and/or former refugees.
  PC supports the resettlement of especially vulnerable refugee groups at resettlement
  sites that service providers designate as “Preferred Communities” which refers to
  locations that offer excellent opportunities for the integration and resettlement
  of the most vulnerable recently arrived refugees. RTAP creates a national one-stop
  source for refugee TA and training and provides coordinated TA and training to ORR-funded
  state refugee programs, other refugee service providers, and agencies and community
  organizations. RTAP fills gaps where no other such TA and training exist and responds
  to the emerging needs of service providers. EEP develops relationships with employers
  to provide ESL and on-the-job learning opportunities for refugees. SASIC is a one-time
  program launched in February 2023 that helps newly arrived Afghans eligible under
  the Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act overcome severe, pervasive, and
  long-lasting combat-related trauma and facilitate their physical, social, emotional,
  and economic well-being. STAR supports the physical, social, emotional, and economic
  well-being of underserved refugees of any origin whose trauma impedes their integration.
  Activities include providing direct mental health and psychosocial support and building
  national and local capacity. NRLLEC builds council members’ capacity to serve as
  leaders and enhances ORR’s understanding of their lived experiences integrating
  into the U.S. NRCYR supports refugee children, youth, and their families by expanding
  the child welfare capacity at refugee-serving agencies. Activities include training
  and technical assistance, partnership and outreach, crisis intervention and case
  consultation, and assessment and evaluation.'
