objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities
  or targeted as specific groups. Under current law, however, self-employed individuals
  are allowed a refundable credit equal for certain family or sick leave taken. In
  general, the sick leave credit is equal to 100% of daily self-employment income
  (equal to self-employment income divided by 260) during a period of qualified sick
  leave, up to $511 per day for 10 days. The family leave credit is equal to two thirds
  of daily self-employment income (but no greater than two thirds of $200) during
  a period of qualified family leave for up to 10 weeks. Under current law, the credit
  applies to leave taken prior to October 1, 2021.
