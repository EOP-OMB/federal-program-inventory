objective: 'To promote use of integrated solid waste management systems to solve solid
  waste generation and management problems at the local, regional and national levels.
  Fiscal Year 2025: Projects seek to increase capacity for food scraps composting
  in the region through the upgrade of yard waste composting facilities. The upgraded
  yard waste composting facilities will be capable of processing waste food which
  increases the capacity for wasted food composting in the region. Additional projects
  seek to enhance recycling systems, making them stronger and more agile to address
  changing materials markets. Further projects seek the promotion of reuse. Reuse
  involves the recovery or reapplication of salvaged, usable materials or products
  in a manner that maintains items in their original form. Reuse takes advantage of
  embodied carbon and energy, resources, and impacts already incurred in the production
  of original products such as lumber, refillable glass bottles, reusable food storage
  containers, refurbished wood pallets, and repaired electronics.'
