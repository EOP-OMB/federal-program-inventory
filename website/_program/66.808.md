    business and food recovery sectors in the a major U.S. city throughout 2021 and

    insight into existing successful food donation partnerships and the barriers to
    further donation-program implementation. Input from interviews, a focus group
    meeting, a survey, and a final round of outreach, informed the recommendations
    and opportunities for the city to consider, regarding wasted food solutions for
    the city.
