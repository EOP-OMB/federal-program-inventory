objective: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank or the Bank) is
  an independent executive agency and a wholly-owned U.S. government corporation.
  Ex-Im Bank is the official export-credit agency of the United States. Its mission
  is to support U.S. exports by providing export financing through its loan, guarantee
  and insurance programs in cases where the private sector is unable or unwilling
  to provide financing or when such support is necessary to level the playing field
  due to financing provided by foreign governments to their exporters that compete
  with U.S. exporters. By facilitating the financing of U.S. exports, Ex-Im Bank helps
  companies create and maintain U.S. jobs.
