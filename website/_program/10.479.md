objective: To reduce the incidence of foodborne illnesses associated with meat, poultry,
  and egg products and to protect the food supply. FSIS is authorized to use cooperative
  agreements to reflect a relationship between FSIS and cooperators to carry out educational
  programs or special studies to improve the safety of the nation's food supply.  Also,
  FSIS has been directed to further develop the Food Emergency Response Network, a
  network of Federal, state and local laboratories that provides the nation the analytic
  capabilities and capacity it needs to cope with agents threatening the food supply.
