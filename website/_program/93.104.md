objective: To provide community-based systems of care for children and adolescents
  with a serious emotional disturbance and their families. The program will ensure
  that services are provided collaboratively across child-serving systems; that each
  child or adolescent served through the program receives an individualized service
  plan developed with the participation of the family (and, where appropriate, the
  child); that each individualized plan designates a case manager to assist the child
  and family; and that funding is provided for mental health services required to
  meet the needs of youngsters in these systems.
