objective: To implement community systems of care to provide comprehensive mental
  health services to children, youth, and young adults, birth through age 21, at risk  for
  or with a serious emotional disturbance (SED) , and their families. Implementation
  of CMHI is guided by the Systems of Care (SOC) approach. The SOC approach strives
  to ensure that mental health services are family driven and youth guided, community
  based, and culturally and linguistically competent.  Through CMHI, SAMHSA addresses
  the mental health needs of children, youth, young adults and their families by providing
  a comprehensive spectrum of mental health services.
