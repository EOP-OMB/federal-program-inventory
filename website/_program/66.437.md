- description: 'Continued Acute Hypoxia Standard Reductions: The 5-year rolling average
    for the maximum summertime area of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) in Long Island
    Sound was estimated at 95 square miles in 2017. This represents a 54 percent decline
    in the five-year rolling average compared to the pre-2000 average of 205 square
    miles (i.e., before the Total Maximum Daily Load was put in place by EPA and the
    states). The area of hypoxia in 2017 was 70 square miles. The hypoxia areas in
    2015 and 2017 are the second and third smallest recorded in the past 31 years
    of monitoring. The severity of hypoxia has also declined, with no area in the
    open waters below 1 mg/l dissolved oxygen in seven of the past eight years. Continued

    pounds of nitrogen every day compared to 2016. 2018 Habitat Restoration and Protection:
    Long Island Sound Study partners completed 12 restoration projects for a total
    of 55.4 acres. The program has now achieved its goal to restore 350 acres of habitat
    by 2020 from the 2014 baseline, and has achieved 35.5 percent of the goal to restore
    1000 acres of coastal habitat by 2035 from the 2014 baseline. The partners also
    completed nine fish passage projects by removing dams or building fishways that
    reopened 38.6 river miles for fish access. The program has now achieved 54.6 percent
    of the goal to reopen 200 river miles to fish passage by 2035 from the 2014 baseline.
    Study partners protected 487.4 acres of open space through acquisitions or easements
    at 15 sites. The program has now achieved 41.3 percent of the goal to protect
    7,000 acres of land by 2035 from the 2014 baseline.'

- description: In 2000, Connecticut and New York developed, and EPA approved, a plan
    to reduce by almost 60 percent the sources of enriched nitrogen from Connecticut
    and New York, as well as reducing upstream sources. The successful actions to
    reduce nitrogen pollution in Long Island Sound have yielded dramatic results.
    Through infrastructure investments of more than $2.5 billion dollars to improve
    wastewater treatment, the total nitrogen load to Long Island Sound is now more
    than 47 million pounds less than the annual discharge in early 1991. The five-year
    rolling average for the maximum summertime area of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia)
    in Long Island Sound was 94 square miles in 2020. This represents a 54 percent
    decline compared to the pre-2000 average of 205 square miles (i.e., before the
    Total Maximum Daily Load for nitrogen was put in place by EPA and the states).

- description: Program investments have allowed the LISS partners to better characterize
    the health of the Long Island Sound watershed and waterbody. Water quality monitoring
    has expanded from the open sound to embayments (bays and harbors). Researchers
    have been able to document water quality improvements due to decreased nitrogen
    loading from wastewater treatment facilities despite climate change making it
    harder to maintain water quality standards. The program continues to support local
    wildlife and fish by investing in the protection of open space habitat; this led
    to 1,007 habitat acres preserved from 2020 to 2021. Public involvement and education
    activities, such as the International Coastal Cleanup events, enhance the sustainability
    and resiliency of the watershed by reducing the amount of marine debris that flows
    into the waterbody. These activities collectively contribute to the overall health
    of Long Island Sound.

- description: "CLEAN WATERS AND HEALTHY WATERSHED (by the numbers): 1,143,882 gallons\
    \ of stormwater treated through LISFF green infrastructure projects during the\
    \ last reporting period; 25,697 square feet of green infrastructure installed\
    \ through LISFF, a total area about the size of 5 ½ NBA basketball courts; 18,092\
    \ pounds of nitrogen prevented from entering Long Island Sound through LISFF projects;\
    \ 51% reduction in hypoxic area (the extent of waters with low oxygen), from a\
    \ 5-year average of 208 square miles in 1987-1999 (an area slightly smaller than\
    \ double the size of Queens, NY) to a 5-year average of 102 square miles in 2019-2023.\
    \ Because many factors can affect hypoxia, such as rainfall, the five-year average\
    \ is measured to help account for natural variability that happens from one year\
    \ to the next; 22% reduction in the duration of hypoxia from the 54-day all-time\
    \ average to 42 days in 2023; and 26 groups monitored water quality at 43 bays\
    \ and harbors around Long Island Sound as part of the Unified Water Study, a community-driven\
    \ monitoring program led by Save the Sound and funded by LISS. In 2023, Project\
    \ Oceanology joined the program to monitor Mumford Cove and the Pequonnock River\
    \ in Connecticut.\nTHE PATHOGEN MONITORING NETWORK  launched a successful pilot\
    \ in 2023. With support from LISS, this initiative aims to establish a cohesive\
    \ network for monitoring fecal bacteria levels across the Long Island Sound watershed\
    \ (the land and waterways that drain into the Sound). A lack of formal coordination\
    \ among groups in the past has led to variability in data quantity and quality,\
    \ highlighting a missed opportunity for collaboration. Through the program, data\
    \ gaps will be bridged, providing more accurate information about the location,\
    \ magnitude, and sources of sewage pollution. Comparable data will also enhance\
    \ coastal habitat management efforts, which include public access to fishing,\
    \ swimming, and community beaches. SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES (by the\
    \ numbers): 232,932 people engaged in Long Island Sound education projects through\
    \ LISFF during the last reporting period; 1,409 volunteers engaged in restoration\
    \ and stewardship through LISFF projects; 650+ students participated in NY Sea\
    \ Grant’s Sound Stewards program, which leads educational field trips to Long\
    \ Island Sound beaches. 40+ people attended 4 capacity building workshops held\
    \ by Restore America’s Estuaries as part of the Long Island Sound Community Impact\
    \ Fund. Workshops centered around topics like grant writing, budgeting, and project\
    \ design; 10 schools were selected to participate in the first year of the Long\
    \ Island Sound Schools Network, where schools will lead school or community-wide\
    \ projects to encourage Long Island Sound conservation and literacy; 71 educators\
    \ in NY and CT participated in workshops held as part of the Long Island Sound\
    \ Mentor Teacher program; and 98 attendees took part in Reimagining Long Island\
    \ Lawns: Eco-Friendly Practices, a virtual event that shared information and resources\
    \ to Long Islanders on how to conserve water and protect water quality through\
    \ sustainable lawncare. \nIn 2023, LISS Sustainable and Resilient Communities\
    \ (SRC) Extension Professionals from CT Sea Grant and NY Sea Grant developed a\
    \ multi-part training series designed to empower decision-makers to increase the\
    \ resilience of their communities to climate change and other environmental threats.\
    \ The series consisted of two webinars, five field trips, and a bi-state workshop."
