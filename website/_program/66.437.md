objective: "The Long Island Sound Program: (1) implements the Long Island Sound Study\
  \ (LISS) Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP); and (2) assists\
  \ the states of Connecticut and New York and other public or nonprofit entities\
  \ in implementation, research, planning, enforcement, and citizen involvement and\
  \ education related to reducing pollution and improving the quality of the environment\
  \ to sustain living resources in the Long Island Sound.  Under the Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Long Island Sound will receive $21 million for\
  \ FY 2022 through CWA \xA7119 and $909,800/year through CWA \xA7320. These allocations\
  \ are expected to continue for five years, through 2026. The LISS goal for IIJA\
  \ funding is to significantly improve Long Island Sound\u2019s environmental health,\
  \ climate resilience, and economic vitality in an equitable manner in communities\
  \ across the Sound\u2019s watershed."

results:
- description: Program investments have allowed the LISS partners to better characterize
    the health of the Long Island Sound watershed and waterbody. Water quality monitoring
    has expanded from the open sound to embayments (bays and harbors). Researchers
    have been able to document water quality improvements due to decreased nitrogen
    loading from wastewater treatment facilities despite climate change making it
    harder to maintain water quality standards. The program continues to support local
    wildlife and fish by investing in the protection of open space habitat; this led
    to 1,007 habitat acres preserved from 2020 to 2021. Public involvement and education
    activities, such as the International Coastal Cleanup events, enhance the sustainability
    and resiliency of the watershed by reducing the amount of marine debris that flows
    into the waterbody. These activities collectively contribute to the overall health
    of Long Island Sound.
