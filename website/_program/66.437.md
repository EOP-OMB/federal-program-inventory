objective: 'The Long Island Sound Program: (1) implements the Long Island Sound Study
  (LISS) Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP); and (2) assists the
  states of Connecticut and New York and other public or nonprofit entities in implementation,
  research, planning, enforcement, and citizen involvement and education related to
  reducing pollution and improving the quality of the environment to sustain living
  resources in the Long Island Sound.  Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
  Act (IIJA), Long Island Sound will receive $21 million for FY 2022 through CWA §119
  and $909,800/year through CWA §320. These allocations are expected to continue for
  five years, through 2026. The LISS goal for IIJA funding is to significantly improve
  Long Island Sound’s environmental health, climate resilience, and economic vitality
  in an equitable manner in communities across the Sound’s watershed.'

- description: 'Continued Acute Hypoxia Standard Reductions: The 5-year rolling average
    for the maximum summertime area of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) in Long Island
    Sound was estimated at 95 square miles in 2017. This represents a 54 percent decline
    in the five-year rolling average compared to the pre-2000 average of 205 square
    miles (i.e., before the Total Maximum Daily Load was put in place by EPA and the
    states). The area of hypoxia in 2017 was 70 square miles. The hypoxia areas in
    2015 and 2017 are the second and third smallest recorded in the past 31 years
    of monitoring. The severity of hypoxia has also declined, with no area in the
    open waters below 1 mg/l dissolved oxygen in seven of the past eight years. Continued
    Point Source Nitrogen Reduction: The 106 New York and Connecticut wastewater treatment
    plants (WWTPs) discharging to Long Island Sound have reduced nitrogen by 45 million
    pounds annually compared to baseline levels established in the 2000 TMDL. In 2017
    reported discharges were below the final TMDL targets. In 2017, progress continued,
    with 3,600 fewer pounds of nitrogen discharged every day compared to 2016. Habitat
    Restoration/Protection: Partners restored or protected 532 acres of coastal habitat
    in 2016 compared to the target of 96 acres in the Strategic Plan. The partners

- description: 'Continued Hypoxia Reductions: The 5-year rolling average for the maximum
    summertime area of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) in Long Island Sound was 89
    square miles in 2018. This represents a 57 percent decline in the five-year rolling
    average compared to the pre-2000 average of 205 square miles (i.e., before the
    Total Maximum Daily Load was put in place by EPA and the states). The maximum
    area of hypoxia in 2018 was 52 square miles. The hypoxia areas in 2015, 2018,
    and 2017 are the second, third and fourth smallest recorded in the past 32 years
    of monitoring. Continued Point Source Nitrogen Reductions: By the end of calendar
    year 2017, the 106 New York and Connecticut wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
    discharging to Long Island Sound have reduced nitrogen by 45 million pounds annually
    compared to baseline levels established in the 2000 TMDL. In 2017 reported discharges
    were below the final TMDL targets. In 2017, wastewater discharged 3,600 fewer
    pounds of nitrogen every day compared to 2016. 2018 Habitat Restoration and Protection:
    Long Island Sound Study partners completed 12 restoration projects for a total
    of 55.4 acres. The program has now achieved its goal to restore 350 acres of habitat
    by 2020 from the 2014 baseline, and has achieved 35.5 percent of the goal to restore
    1000 acres of coastal habitat by 2035 from the 2014 baseline. The partners also
    completed nine fish passage projects by removing dams or building fishways that
    reopened 38.6 river miles for fish access. The program has now achieved 54.6 percent
    of the goal to reopen 200 river miles to fish passage by 2035 from the 2014 baseline.
    Study partners protected 487.4 acres of open space through acquisitions or easements
    at 15 sites. The program has now achieved 41.3 percent of the goal to protect
    7,000 acres of land by 2035 from the 2014 baseline.'

- description: In 2000, Connecticut and New York developed, and EPA approved, a plan
    to reduce by almost 60 percent the sources of enriched nitrogen from Connecticut
    and New York, as well as reducing upstream sources. The successful actions to
    reduce nitrogen pollution in Long Island Sound have yielded dramatic results.
    Through infrastructure investments of more than $2.5 billion dollars to improve
    wastewater treatment, the total nitrogen load to Long Island Sound is now more
    than 47 million pounds less than the annual discharge in early 1991. The five-year
    rolling average for the maximum summertime area of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia)
    in Long Island Sound was 94 square miles in 2020. This represents a 54 percent
    decline compared to the pre-2000 average of 205 square miles (i.e., before the
    Total Maximum Daily Load for nitrogen was put in place by EPA and the states).

  year: '2021'
- description: Program investments have allowed the LISS partners to better characterize
    the health of the Long Island Sound watershed and waterbody. Water quality monitoring
    has expanded from the open sound to embayments (bays and harbors). Researchers
    have been able to document water quality improvements due to decreased nitrogen
    loading from wastewater treatment facilities despite climate change making it
    harder to maintain water quality standards. The program continues to support local
    wildlife and fish by investing in the protection of open space habitat; this led
    to 1,007 habitat acres preserved from 2020 to 2021. Public involvement and education
    activities, such as the International Coastal Cleanup events, enhance the sustainability
    and resiliency of the watershed by reducing the amount of marine debris that flows
    into the waterbody. These activities collectively contribute to the overall health
    of Long Island Sound.
