objective: The purpose of the Telehealth Intervention Strategies for WIC (THIS-WIC)
  is to competitively select State Agencies to implement promising and well-designed
  telehealth innovations that supplement the WIC nutrition education including breastfeeding
  support offered in the WIC clinic, while decreasing barriers to access among WIC
  participants. THIS-WIC rigorously evaluates the interventions implemented by sub-grantees,
  including a process evaluation and cost estimate and disseminates findings to inform
  the WIC Program at the Federal, State, and local level, and contribute to the evidence
  base related to telehealth. Additionally, the program coordinates meetings that
  provide meaningful opportunities for information-sharing and project coordination.

- description: "USDA/Tufts Telehealth Intervention Strategies for WIC (THIS-WIC) accomplished\
    \ and progressed to completing a number of milestones. On November 7, 2019, Tufts\
    \ hosted the kickoff meeting with our leadership team and advisory board members.\
    \ In early October 2019, THIS-WIC sent out an interest survey to WIC State Agencies\
    \ (SAs) for the grant opportunity. They received responses from 60 unique SAs\
    \ and heard from 48 SA Directors. Conducting the survey allowed THIS-WIC to build\
    \ awareness around the grant opportunity while gathering valuable feedback on\
    \ what technical support requests and concerns SAs have. The survey responses\
    \ also helped to guide the creation of the Request for Proposal (RFP), including\
    \ selection criteria and communication materials and resources (e.g., Resource\
    \ Library). Throughout the first quarter, THIS-WIC has been working collaboratively\
    \ with FNS to obtain feedback on the RFP. On February 5, 2020, THIS-WIC released\
    \ the request for proposals (RFP) and launched the website. THIS-WIC worked collaboratively\
    \ to disseminate the RFP broadly. Organizations such as the National WIC Association\
    \ (NWA), Association of State Public Health Nutritionists, and Association of\
    \ Maternal & Child Health Program raised awareness around the opportunity. THIS-WIC,\
    \ NWA, and FNS sent announcement emails directly to WIC State Agency (SA) Directors.\
    \ Additionally, phone calls were made in an attempt to engage SAs Directors that\
    \ did not respond to our formative research survey in the fall. \nTHIS-WIC organized\
    \ three webinars to share general information about the RFP, Telehealth Resource\
    \ Centers, and the evaluation process. The RFP, Telehealth Resource Center, and\
    \ evaluation webinar had 107, 93, and 99 registrations respectively. The webinars\
    \ engaged 36 unique SAs and had an average of 69 participants.  The project management\
    \ team (PMT) recorded webinars and posted them to the website shortly after their\
    \ airing, along with responses to participantsâ€™ questions. After the webinars,\
    \ THIS-WIC continued outreach to SAs through multiple channels. The THIS-WIC weekly\
    \ digest engages 90 listserv members by sharing frequently asked questions, resources,\
    \ and updates. Every Monday, NWA also reminds SAs of the opportunity through their\
    \ Monday reports. Organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and\
    \ Black Mothers' Breast Feeding Association promoted the opportunity through social\
    \ media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook). In addition to disseminating the RFP, the project\
    \ management team organized procedures for reviewing brief and full proposals.\
    \ The team finalized scoring rubrics and the SurveyMonkey Apply platform for the\
    \ review process. The PMT also selected nine team members for the brief proposal\
    \ review that cover the expertise of nutrition, WIC, and telehealth."
