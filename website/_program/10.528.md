objective: The purpose of the Telehealth Intervention Strategies for WIC (THIS-WIC)
  is to competitively select State Agencies to implement promising and well-designed
  telehealth innovations that supplement the WIC nutrition education including breastfeeding
  support offered in the WIC clinic, while decreasing barriers to access among WIC
  participants. THIS-WIC rigorously evaluates the interventions implemented by sub-grantees,
  including a process evaluation and cost estimate and disseminates findings to inform
  the WIC Program at the Federal, State, and local level, and contribute to the evidence
  base related to telehealth. Additionally, the program coordinates meetings that
  provide meaningful opportunities for information-sharing and project coordination.
