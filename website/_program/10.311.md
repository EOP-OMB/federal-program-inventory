objective: The primary goal of BFRDP is to help beginning farmers and ranchers in
  the United States and its territories enter and/or improve their successes in farming,
  ranching, and management of nonindustrial private forest lands, through support
  for projects that provide education, mentoring, and technical assistance to give
  beginning farmers and ranchers the knowledge, skills, and tools needed to make informed
  decisions for their operations and enhance their sustainability. The term “farmer”
  is used in the broadest sense and may be interpreted to include agricultural farmers,
  ranchers, and non-industrial private forest owners and managers.
