objective: 'The Community Forest Program (CFP) is a competitive grant program that
  provides financial assistance to tribal entities, local governments, and qualified
  conservation non-profit organizations to acquire and establish community forests
  that provide community benefits.  Community forest benefits are specified in the
  authorizing statute (16 U.S.C. 2103(d)) and Final Rule (36 CFR Part 230), including:
  economic benefits from sustainable forest management and tourism; environmental
  benefits from natural resource conservation such as storm water management, clean
  air and water, and wildlife habitat; forest-based educational programs, model forest
  stewardship activities; and recreational opportunities. Public access to the community
  forests is required and intended to enhance public health and well-being. In addition,
  the program authorizes allocation of a limited amount of appropriated funds to State
  Foresters and equivalent Indian tribe officials for technical assistance to implement
  community forest projects.'
