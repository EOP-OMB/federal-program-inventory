objective: 'The purpose of CFP is to achieve community benefits by establishing community
  forests through 50/50 financial assistance competitive grant awards to local governments,
  federally recognized tribes, and eligible nonprofit organizations.  Grant funds
  are used by successful applicants to acquire and protect private forestlands. Community
  forest benefits are specified in the authorizing statute (16 U.S.C. 2103(d) & 2109(e))
  and final rule (36 CFR Part 230), including: economic benefits from sustainable
  forest management and tourism; environmental benefits from natural resource conservation
  such as storm water management, clean air and water, and wildlife habitat; forest-based
  educational programs, model forest stewardship activities; and recreational opportunities.
  Public access to the community forests is required and intended to enhance public
  health and well-being. In addition, the program authorizes allocation of a limited
  amount of appropriated funds to State Foresters and equivalent Indian tribe officials
  for technical assistance to implement community forest projects.'
