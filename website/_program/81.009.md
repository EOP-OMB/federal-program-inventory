objective: "In 2012, Congress passed the American Medical Isotopes Production Act\
  \ (AMIPA), which directed the Department of Energy to establish a technology-neutral\
  \ program to support the establishment of domestic supplies of molybdenum-99 (Mo-99)\
  \ without the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU). The Department of Energy\u2019\
  s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) has implemented this by competitively\
  \ awarding 50%/50% cost-shared cooperative agreements to commercial entities and\
  \ providing funds to the DOE National Laboratories to support development of non-HEU\
  \ Mo-99 production technologies. Mo-99 is a critical radioisotope whose decay byproduct\
  \ technetium-99m (Tc-99m), is used in over 40,000 nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures\
  \ performed daily in the United States. Its primary uses include diagnosing heart\
  \ disease and cancer, as well as studying organ structure and function. The isotope\u2019\
  s short half-life and excellent binding properties make it uniquely suited for medical\
  \ procedures. However, due to its short half-life it must be produced continuously\
  \ to meet the medical community\u2019s requirements. The United States does not\
  \ currently have a domestic production capability for Mo-99 sufficient to meet the\
  \ needs of the U.S. healthcare community, currently estimated at 4,500 6-day curies\
  \ per week. The establishment of reliable, commercial, non-HEU-based Mo-99 production\
  \ in the United States complements the long-standing U.S. policy to minimize and\
  \ eliminate the use of proliferation-sensitive HEU in civilian applications in order\
  \ to prevent the potential theft of this material for malevolent use. The United\
  \ States is at the nexus of two related priorities: the need to ensure a reliable,\
  \ robust Mo-99 supply for U.S. patient care, and discouraging the use of proliferation-sensitive\
  \ HEU in civilian applications. NNSA will issue Cooperative Agreements with the\
  \ purpose of providing additional federal funding to accelerate commercial Mo-99\
  \ projects\u2019 time to market so that industry and government can fulfill these\
  \ two critical priorities and decrease the U.S. medical community\u2019s reliance\
  \ on foreign supplies of Mo-99."
