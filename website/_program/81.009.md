objective: 'In 2012, Congress passed the American Medical Isotopes Production Act
  (AMIPA), which directed the Department of Energy to establish a technology-neutral
  program to support the establishment of domestic supplies of molybdenum-99 (Mo-99)
  without the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU). The Department of Energy’s National
  Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) has implemented this by competitively
  awarding 50%/50% cost-shared cooperative agreements to commercial entities and providing
  funds to the DOE National Laboratories to support development of non-HEU Mo-99 production
  technologies. Mo-99 is a critical radioisotope whose decay byproduct technetium-99m
  (Tc-99m), is used in over 40,000 nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures performed
  daily in the United States. Its primary uses include diagnosing heart disease and
  cancer, as well as studying organ structure and function. The isotope’s short half-life
  and excellent binding properties make it uniquely suited for medical procedures.
  However, due to its short half-life it must be produced continuously to meet the
  medical community’s requirements. The United States does not currently have a domestic
  production capability for Mo-99 sufficient to meet the needs of the U.S. healthcare
  community, currently estimated at 4,500 6-day curies per week. The establishment
  of reliable, commercial, non-HEU-based Mo-99 production in the United States complements
  the long-standing U.S. policy to minimize and eliminate the use of proliferation-sensitive
  HEU in civilian applications in order to prevent the potential theft of this material
  for malevolent use. The United States is at the nexus of two related priorities:
  the need to ensure a reliable, robust Mo-99 supply for U.S. patient care, and discouraging
  the use of proliferation-sensitive HEU in civilian applications. NNSA will issue
  Cooperative Agreements with the purpose of providing additional federal funding
  to accelerate commercial Mo-99 projects’ time to market so that industry and government
  can fulfill these two critical priorities and decrease the U.S. medical community’s
  reliance on foreign supplies of Mo-99.'
