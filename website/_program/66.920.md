objective: The objectives of the Post-Consumer Materials Management Infrastructure
  Grant Program (also known as the SWIFR Grant Program) as stated in the Save Our
  Seas 2.0 Act are to support improvements to local post-consumer materials management,
  including municipal recycling programs, and assist local waste management authorities
  in making improvements to local waste management systems. In alignment with E.O.
  14052, the program also aims to invest public dollars equitably, create high-quality
  jobs with strong labor standards, ensure goods and services are made in America,
  and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis.
  The program will consider relevant approaches to achieving these goals and objectives
  consistent with statutory requirements. Additionally, the program will implement
  data-driven strategies to measure successful implementation, including establishing
  baseline metrics, setting specific targets, and regularly collecting and analyzing
  data on outcomes. This data-centric approach will support comprehensive evaluation
  efforts to assess the program's impact on local communities, the economy, and the
  environment, thereby ensuring continuous improvement and long-term effectiveness
  of the grant program.
