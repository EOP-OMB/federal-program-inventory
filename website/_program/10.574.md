objective: 'The goal of the Fiscal Year(FY) 2024 Team Nutrition Training Grants for
  Meal Pattern Modernization and Retention and Mentorship Opportunities is to help
  State agencies build capacity for implementing the Final Rule, Child Nutrition Programs:
  Meal Patterns Consistent with the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and
  address residual COVID-19 effects on staff retention in school meal programs. During
  school years (SY) 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly
  exacerbated food insecurity, diet-related diseases, and health disparities. It also
  affected school meal service across the country. Schools experienced school foodservice
  labor shortages and staff turnover as well as supply chain disruptions. The COVID-19
  public health emergency underscored the need to safeguard and continue to support
  healthy school environments; provide technical assistance, coaching, and mentoring
  to School Nutrition Professionals; and to capture and share the institutional knowledge
  of School Nutrition Professionals. The FY 2024 Team Nutrition Training Grant activities
  will allow State agencies to provide technical assistance to School Nutrition Professionals
  and help ensure they have the skills and knowledge to prepare and serve nutritious
  meals. The grant will also help School Nutrition Professionals pilot and implement
  coaching and mentoring programs and resources, and implement ways to capture and
  share the institutional, job specific knowledge of school nutrition directors, managers,
  and front-line staff. Ultimately, this will assist SFAs to engage in critical activities
  including but not limited to identifying and applying ways to further improve the
  nutritional quality of school meals, meet meal pattern requirements and weekly dietary
  specifications for school meals, and implement scratch cooking techniques.'
