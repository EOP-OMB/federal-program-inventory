objective: In response to the the outflows of refugees and migrants from Venezuela,
  PRM, since 2017, has provided direct emergency humanitarian assistance such as food,
  non-food items, shelter, health, psychosocial support, and livelihoods support to
  assist with the integration of Venezuelans into host communities, via multilateral
  and non-governmental implementing partners in Latin America and the Caribbean.  PRM
  also provides humanitarian assistance for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in
  Colombia and for Colombian refugees throughout the region.  This assistance helps
  ensure adequate protection for vulnerable people, fill gaps in the provision of
  emergency humanitarian assistance, and builds local government and community capacity.
