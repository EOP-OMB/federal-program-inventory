objective: 'To assist state, Tribal, territory and/or local government  agencies in
  building programs which protect, manage, and restore wetlands. The primary focus
  of the grants is to build state, Tribal, and territory wetland programs. A secondary
  focus is to build local (e.g. county or municipal) programs.  For the National WPDGs:
  EPA has identified the following national priorities - National Priority Area 1:
  Core Elements Framework. National Priority Area 1 is based on the four core elements
  of a Comprehensive state/Tribal/territory Wetland Program: 1) Monitoring and Assessment;
  2) Voluntary Wetland Restoration and Protection; 3) Regulatory Approaches Including
  CWA 401 Certification; and 4) Wetland-Specific Water Quality Standards. Further
  explanation of all of the elements can be found at the following website address:
  https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/wetland-program-development-grants. The Wetland Program
  Development Grants (WPDG) program strives to develop state/Tribal/territory/local
  government programs that will incorporate each of these elements. For the Five-Star
  Restoration Training Grants, EPA funds an intermediary organization to provide subawards
  to eligible subawardees to bring together citizen groups, corporations, youth conservation
  corps, students, landowners, and government agencies to undertake projects that
  achieve environmental training through voluntary, community/watershed-based wetland
  restoration projects.'

results:
- description: In FY 16, funding will continue to support projects that encourage
    the use of data documenting wetland condition, function, status and trends to
    support development and implementation of other state wetland program core elements
    such as wetland regulation, restoration, and development of water quality standards
    for wetlands; identify best practices for developing wetland restoration and protection
    programs while leveraging adaptation to climate change; develop a handbook for
    states, tribes, and local governments on the policy and practice of stream compensatory
    mitigation; develop and deliver in-lieu fee mitigation training for states, tribes,
    and local governments; increase understanding of multiple aspects of state and
    tribal wetland programs, including all four of the EPA core essential elements,
    resulting in more robust state and tribal programs; and develop and distribute
    programmatic support documents for identifying and sampling candidate reference
    wetland sites using consistent wetland condition assessment methods across the
    nation, piloted through programs in 10 states. EPA anticipates issuing a competition
    in FY16. In FY 16, funding will continue to support projects that encourage the
    use of data documenting wetland condition, function, status and trends to support
    development and implementation of other state wetland program core elements such
    as wetland regulation, restoration, and development of water quality standards
    for wetlands; identify best practices for developing wetland restoration and protection
    programs; develop and deliver in-lieu fee mitigation training for states, tribes,
    and local governments; and increase understanding of multiple aspects of state
    and tribal wetland programs, including all four of the EPA core essential elements,
    resulting in more robust state and tribal programs; and develop. EPA issued a
    competition in FY16 and made seven (7) awards.

    identify best practices for developing wetland restoration and protection programs;

- description: 'For FY 2019, funding support ed projects include projects that: produce
    a series of comprehensive guides and webinars on the most challenging components
    of in lieu fee (ILF) program implementation; developing stronger cooperative federalism
    between federal and state agencies in the area of wetland regulation; improve
    the capacity of states, tribes, and local government agencies to partner with
    hazard mitigation agencies to integrate wetland restoration priorities into new
    state and local hazard mitigation plans; providing tools for the development of
    complete state assumption applications that meet program requirements; increasing
    the capacity of states, tribes, and local governments to ensure ecologically effective
    compensatory mitigation; and identifying ways to enhance, protect and restore
    wetlands within and surrounding urban areas to maximize economic, ecological and
    social benefits for urban communities.'
  year: '2019'
- description: 'In FY 2022 no competitions were announced for this program.  Funding
    continues to support support activities to build state/tribal/territory/local
    wetland program building and improvement. Projects were funded in FY 2022 from
    the previous year''s RFA. Funded projects for FY 2022 include: working with tribes
    to build wetland program capacity; advancing state protection of non-federal waters;
    developing a policy framework for greater use of remote sensing for wetland regulatory
    programs; developing approaches to applying wetlands tools for disaster management;
    improving the success of compensatory mitigation under changing conditions; and
    promoting the integration of wetland protection and restoration with multiple
    types of state-level plans.'
  year: '2022'
- description: No competition was announced for this program based on available funds
    and Agency priorities for the National WPDG. The number of applications and the
    number of awards made is dependent on the competitive announcement issued. The
    announcements include the number of anticipated awards. Projects support activities
    to build state/Tribal/territory/local wetland program building and improvement.
