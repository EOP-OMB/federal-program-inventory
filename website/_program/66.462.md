objective: 'To assist state, territory, tribal, and/or local government (S/T/LG) agencies
  in building programs which protect, manage, and restore wetlands. The primary focus
  of the grants is to build state, territory, and tribal wetland programs. A secondary
  focus is to build local (e.g. county or municipal) programs.


  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:  For the National WPDGs: EPA has identified
  the following national priorities - National Priority Area 1: Core Elements Framework.
  National Priority Area 1 is based on the four core elements of a Comprehensive State/Territory/Tribal
  Wetlands Program: 1) Monitoring and Assessment; 2) Voluntary Wetland Restoration
  and Protection; 3) Regulatory Approaches Including CWA 401 Certification; and 4)
  Wetland-Specific Water Quality Standards. Further explanation of all of the elements
  can be found at the following website address: https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/wetland-program-development-grants.
  The Wetlands Program Development Grants (WPDG) program strives to develop State/Territory/Tribal/local
  government programs that will incorporate each of these elements. For the Five-Star
  Restoration Training Grants, EPA funds an intermediary organization to provide subawards
  to eligible subawardees to bring together citizen groups, corporations, youth conservation
  corps, students, landowners, and government agencies to undertake projects that
  achieve environmental training through voluntary, community/watershed-based wetland
  restoration projects.'
