objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including deferred and
  dedicated payments, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, under current
  law employer-provided life insurance benefits are excluded from an employee’s gross
  income (to the extent that the employer’s share of the total costs does not exceed
  the cost of $50,000 of such insurance) even though the employer’s costs for the
  insurance are a deductible business expense.
