objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including deferred and
  dedicated payments, should be included in taxable income. In addition, investment
  income would be taxed as earned. In contrast, under current law individual taxpayers
  can take advantage of traditional and Roth IRAs to defer or otherwise reduce the
  tax on the return to their retirement savings. The IRA contribution limit is $7,000
  in 2024; taxpayers age 50 or over are allowed to make additional “catch-up’’ contributions
  of $1,000. Contributions to a traditional IRA are generally deductible but the deduction
  is phased out for workers with incomes above certain levels if the workers or their
  spouses are active participants in an employer-provided retirement plan. Contributions
  and account earnings are includible in income when withdrawn from traditional IRAs.
  Roth IRA contributions are not deductible, but earnings and withdrawals are exempt
  from taxation. Income limits also apply to Roth IRA contributions.
