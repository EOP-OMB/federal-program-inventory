objective: OSD ManTech funds basic, applied, and advanced research to direct the development
  and implementation of DoD plans, programs, projects, activities, and policies that
  promote the development and application of advanced technologies to manufacturing
  processes, tools, and equipment; improve the manufacturing quality, productivity,
  technology, and practices of businesses and workers providing goods and services
  to the DoD; focus DoD support for the development and application of advanced manufacturing
  technologies and processes for use to meet manufacturing requirements that are essential
  to the critical national defense, as well as for repair and remanufacturing in support
  of the operations of systems commands, depots, air logistics centers, and shipyards.  Disseminate
  information concerning improved manufacturing concepts, best practices, product
  data exchange specifications, computer-aided acquisition and logistics support,
  and rapid acquisition of manufactured parts.  Sustain and enhance the skills and
  capabilities of the manufacturing work force.  Promote development and dissemination
  of tools that expand the skills and capabilities of the manufacturing work force,
  provide for higher levels of worker education and training, and facilitate coordination
