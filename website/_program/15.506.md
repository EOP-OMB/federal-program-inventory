objective: "There are three goals for the program: (1) augment the supply of usable\
  \ water in the United States; (2) understand the environmental impacts of desalination\
  \ and develop approaches to minimize these impacts relative to other water supply\
  \ alternatives; (3) develop approaches to lower the financial costs of desalination\
  \ so that it is an attractive option relative to other alternatives in locations\
  \ where traditional sources of water are inadequate.\r\n  \r\nThe three principal\
  \ parts of the program are: (1) perform research on desalination technologies and\
  \ related issues to advance the state of the art forward (research and studies),\
  \ (2) conduct development and demonstration activities to test technological advancements,\
  \ confirm economics, and gain public acceptance (development projects), and (3)\
  \ support operation and maintenance at the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination\
  \ Research Facility (BGNDRF) "
