objective: The H-1B Skills Training Grants provide training and related activities
  to workers to assist them in gaining the skills and competencies needed to obtain
  or upgrade employment in high-growth industries or economic sectors.  Over time,
  these education and training programs will help businesses reduce their use of skilled
  foreign professionals permitted to work in the U.S. on a temporary basis under the
  H-1B visa program.
