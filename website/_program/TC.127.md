objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, under current
  law, employer-paid health insurance premiums and other medical expenses (including
  long-term care or Health Reimbursement Accounts) are not included in employee gross
  income even though they are deducted as a business expense by the employee.
