objective: 'The National Estuary Program (NEP) goal is to protect and restore the
  water quality and estuarine resources of estuaries and associated watersheds designated
  by the EPA Administrator as estuaries of national significance. The 28 estuaries
  of national significance, or NEPs, use an ecosystem-based management approach to
  help achieve their protection and restoration goals. For example, each NEP characterizes
  the priority problems in its estuary and surrounding watershed, develops a long-term
  plan known as a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) that identifies
  actions to address those problems, and identifies partners, including lead entities,
  who will implement those actions. Implementation of CCMPs can include the following
  actions: protecting and restoring habitat, including wetlands; supporting water
  quality protection and restoration, including Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan
  implementation; monitoring for, assessing the extent of toxics loadings and pathogen
  contamination, and taking steps to address excess loadings and contamination; implementing
  stormwater management, reducing non-point source pollution impacts, and promoting
  the adoption of green infrastructure approaches; preventing the spread of aquatic
  invasive species and/or managing their impacts; developing and implementing nutrient
  reduction strategies; conducting climate vulnerability assessments and developing
  and implementing climate change adaptation strategies and using adaptation tools
  to promote coastal resilience; and developing and implementing strategies to provide
  opportunities for residents of urban minority and/or under-served communities to
  have greater access to urban waters, participate in urban ecosystem restoration,
  and participate in capacity-building/educational activities. In addition to CCMP
  implementation, NEPs and other eligible recipients, address urgent and challenging
  issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas. NEP
  projects funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA,
  Public Law 117-58), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), should
  seek to: accelerate and more extensively implement CCMPs, ensure that benefits reach
  disadvantaged communities, build the adaptive capacity of ecosystems and communities
  to climate change, and leverage additional resources, including from other IIJA
  programs. After approval of each estuary program’s equity strategy, EPA will waive
  non-federal cost-share requirements for FY 2024 – FY 2026 IIJA funds. The purpose
  of the equity strategy is to ensure that each NEP is reviewing potential projects
  and utilization of IIJA funds through the lens of equitable and fair access to the
  benefits from environmental programs for all individuals. The equity strategy should
  outline how IIJA funds will be utilized to increase investments in disadvantaged
  communities and the benefits that flow to them. EPA''s funding priority is to award
  assistance agreements that support the 28 National Estuary Programs'' (NEPs) efforts
  to address their estuarine watersheds'' priority problems identified in each of
  the 28 long-term management plans known as Comprehensive Conservation and Management
  Plans (CCMPs). EPA will provide focused support for NEPs to address priority problems
  identified by NEP management conferences and to document accomplishments and environmental
  results. NEP efforts address such problems as: (1) impacts on estuarine water quality
  and living resources of nutrients, toxics (chemical, heavy metals), pathogen contamination,
  and sediment attributable to excess loadings and non-point stormwater runoff; e.g.,
  excess nutrient loadings can result in nutrient over-enrichment and hypoxic conditions
  in estuarine water bodies; (2) habitat loss/degradation; (3) risks to CCMP implementation
  due to climate change impacts, and adaptation strategies to build regional, local,
  and tribal officials'' capacity to address climate change impacts on NEP watersheds,
  and to promote community resilience. Activities that build capacity include conducting
  vulnerability assessments and developing and implementing climate adaptation strategies
  and programs; and 4) need for decision makers in estuarine communities to implement
  sustainable land use, green infrastructure, and low-impact development best practices.
  In FY 2023, EPA also funded through the NEP Coastal Watersheds Grant an intermediary
  organization to fund subawards that support projects that address urgent and challenging
  issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal and estuarine
  areas.'

- description: 'In FY 16, grants will support the NEP''s CCMP implementation by funding
    NEP efforts that include: protecting and restoring up to 100,000 acres of estuarine
    habitat; protecting and restoring estuarine water quality in NEP study areas;
    supporting core Clean Water Act programs like those that target stormwater, excess
    nutrients, and pathogens and promoting adoption of green infrastructure approaches
    to reduce the impacts of stormwater and non-point source pollution; conducting
    vulnerability assessments and/or implementing climate adaptation strategies in
    over 50% of NEP study areas and collaborating with other EPA programs and with
    agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to build regional,
    local, and tribal coastal community resilience to impacts of climate change on
    coastal ecosystems, public health, and economies; building local capacity to reach
    out to and involve urban community residents who typically may not have had access
    to water bodies in NEP study areas nor have been actively engaged in urban water
    body protection and restoration. Maintaining high-quality habitat is one way of
    ensuring the health of the nation''s estuaries. Since 2000, the NEPs and their
    partners have protected and restored over 1.5 million acres of habitat in the
    28 NEP estuarine watersheds. The acreage protected and restored by the NEPs and
    their partners enhances the 28 NEP''s capacity to support healthy populations
    of wildlife and near-coastal and marine organisms, including many commercially-valuable
    shellfish and finfish. That acreage also enhances the 28 estuarine watersheds''
    capacity to support the economic and ecosystem services and aesthetic qualities
    provided by estuarine environments and on which coastal populations depend for
    their livelihoods and well-being. In FY 16, the NEPs and their partners protected
    and restored approximately 111,584 acres of estuarine habitat in their estuarine
    watersheds. '
