objective: "The National Estuary Program (NEP) goal is to protect and restore the\
  \ water quality and estuarine resources of estuaries and associated watersheds designated\
  \ by the EPA Administrator as estuaries of national significance. The 28 estuaries\
  \ of national significance, or NEPs, use an ecosystem-based management approach\
  \ to help achieve their protection and restoration goals. For example, each NEP\
  \ characterizes the priority problems in its estuary and surrounding watershed,\
  \ develops a long-term plan known as a Comprehensive Conservation and Management\
  \ Plan (CCMP) that identifies actions to address those problems, and identifies\
  \ partners, including lead entities, who will implement those actions. Implementation\
  \ of CCMPs can include the following actions: protecting and restoring habitat,\
  \ including wetlands; supporting water quality protection and restoration, including\
  \ Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan implementation; monitoring for, assessing\
  \ the extent of toxics loadings and pathogen contamination, and taking steps to\
  \ address excess loadings and contamination; implementing stormwater management,\
  \ reducing non-point source pollution impacts, and promoting the adoption of green\
  \ infrastructure approaches; preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species and/or\
  \ managing their impacts; developing and implementing nutrient reduction strategies;\
  \ conducting climate vulnerability assessments and developing and implementing climate\
  \ change adaptation strategies and using adaptation tools to promote coastal resilience;\
  \ and developing and implementing strategies to provide opportunities for residents\
  \ of urban minority and/or under-served communities to have greater access to urban\
  \ waters, participate in urban ecosystem restoration, and participate in capacity-building/educational\
  \ activities. In addition to CCMP implementation, NEPs and other eligible recipients,\
  \ address urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic\
  \ well-being of coastal areas. NEP projects funded through the Infrastructure Investment\
  \ and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA, Public Law 117-58), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure\
  \ Law (BIL), should seek to: accelerate and more extensively implement CCMPs, ensure\
  \ that benefits reach disadvantaged communities, build the adaptive capacity of\
  \ ecosystems and communities to climate change, and leverage additional resources,\
  \ including from other IIJA programs. After approval of each estuary program\u2019\
  s equity strategy, EPA will waive non-federal cost-share requirements for FY 2024\
  \ \u2013 FY 2026 IIJA funds. The purpose of the equity strategy is to ensure that\
  \ each NEP is reviewing potential projects and utilization of IIJA funds through\
  \ the lens of equitable and fair access to the benefits from environmental programs\
  \ for all individuals. The equity strategy should outline how IIJA funds will be\
  \ utilized to increase investments in disadvantaged communities and the benefits\
  \ that flow to them.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: EPA's funding priority\
  \ is to award assistance agreements that support the 28 National Estuary Programs'\
  \ (NEPs) efforts to address their estuarine watersheds' priority problems identified\
  \ in each of the 28 long-term management plans known as Comprehensive Conservation\
  \ and Management Plans (CCMPs). EPA will provide focused support for NEPs to address\
  \ priority problems identified by NEP management conferences and to document accomplishments\
  \ and environmental results. NEP efforts address such problems as: (1) impacts on\
  \ estuarine water quality and living resources of nutrients, toxics (chemical, heavy\
  \ metals), pathogen contamination, and sediment attributable to excess loadings\
  \ and non-point stormwater runoff; e.g., excess nutrient loadings can result in\
  \ nutrient over-enrichment and hypoxic conditions in estuarine water bodies; (2)\
  \ habitat loss/degradation; (3) risks to CCMP implementation due to climate change\
  \ impacts, and adaptation strategies to build regional, local, and tribal officials'\
  \ capacity to address climate change impacts on NEP watersheds, and to promote community\
  \ resilience. Activities that build capacity include conducting vulnerability assessments\
  \ and developing and implementing climate adaptation strategies and programs; and\
  \ 4) need for decision makers in estuarine communities to implement sustainable\
  \ land use, green infrastructure, and low-impact development best practices. In\
  \ FY 2023, EPA also funded through the NEP Coastal Watersheds Grant an intermediary\
  \ organization to fund subawards that support projects that address urgent and challenging\
  \ issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal and estuarine\
  \ areas."
