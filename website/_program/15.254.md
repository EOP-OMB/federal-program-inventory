objective: The purpose of the OSMRE Youth Program is to carry out appropriate environmental
  projects cooperatively with non-profit IRS 501(c)(3) eligible applicants that have
  access to AmeriCorps Volunteers to Service to America positions through partnership
  with the Corporation for National and Community or other intermediary organization
  on issues impacting coal communities and historic coal mining areas. The goal is
  to promote and stimulate public purposes such as education, job training, development
  of responsible citizenship and productive community involvement.  The program is
  designed to further the understanding and appreciation of natural and cultural resources
  through the involvement of youth and young adults. It is also designed to continue
  the longstanding efforts of OSMRE to provide opportunities for public service, youth
  employment, minority youth development, training, and participation of young adults
  in accomplishing environmental-related work.
