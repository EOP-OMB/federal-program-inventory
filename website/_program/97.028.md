objective: "To improve emergency management practices among State, local and tribal\
  \ and territorial government managers, and Federal officials as well, in response\
  \ to emergencies and disasters. Programs embody the Comprehensive Emergency Management\
  \ System by unifying the elements of management common to all emergencies: planning,\
  \ preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. Emergency Management Institute\
  \ (EMI) training is conducted in an effort to strengthen the security and resilience\
  \ of the United States through systematic preparation for the threats that pose\
  \ the greatest risk to the security of the Nation, including acts of terrorism,\
  \ cyber-attacks, pandemics, and catastrophic natural disasters.  This program supports\
  \ the national training program as mentioned in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster\
  \ Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq. and the national preparedness\
  \ system.  This program also supports FEMA\u2019s strategic plan goal 3 to promote\
  \ and sustain a ready FEMA and prepared nation. Performance measures are based on\
  \ total cost per student day of training for EMI resident, off-site and Independent\
  \ Study courses and total number of offerings and student completions (per quarter)\
  \ for resident, non-resident, virtual, and webinar deliveries."
