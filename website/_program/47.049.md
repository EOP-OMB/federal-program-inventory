objective: 'To promote the progress of the mathematical and physical sciences and
  thereby strengthen the Nation''s scientific enterprise; to increase the store of
  scientific knowledge and enhance understanding of major problems confronting the
  Nation. Most of the research supported is basic in character. The program includes
  support of research project grants in the following disciplines: astronomical sciences,
  chemistry, materials research, mathematical sciences, physics, as well as support
  for symposia and conferences. Basic research in multidisciplinary areas related
  to these disciplines is especially encouraged. Support is also provided for state-of-the-art
  user facilities in astronomy, physics, and many areas of materials science; science
  and technology centers; institutes; undergraduate student research; faculty enhancement;
  curriculum development; instrumentation; laboratory improvement; and for research
  opportunities for women, minority, and disabled scientists and engineers.'
