  \ multiple drugs and treatments; and injury, critical illness, sepsis, and wound\
  \ healing.\u200B NIGMS-funded scientists investigate how living systems work at\
  \ a range of levels\u2014from molecules and cells to tissues and organs\u2014in\
  \ research organisms, humans, and populations. Additionally, to ensure the vitality\
  \ and continued productivity of the research enterprise, NIGMS provides leadership\
