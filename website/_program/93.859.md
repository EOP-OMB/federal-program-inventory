objective: 'The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) supports basic
  research that increases our understanding of biological processes and lays the foundation
  for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. NIGMS also supports
  research in specific clinical areas that affect multiple organ systems: anesthesiology
  and peri-operative pain; clinical pharmacology ​common to multiple drugs and treatments;
  and injury, critical illness, sepsis, and wound healing.​ NIGMS-funded scientists
  investigate how living systems work at a range of levels—from molecules and cells
  to tissues and organs—in research organisms, humans, and populations. Additionally,
  to ensure the vitality and continued productivity of the research enterprise, NIGMS
  provides leadership in supporting the training of the next generation of scientists,
  enhancing the diversity of the scientific workforce, and developing research capacity
  throughout the country.'
