objective: "In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, communities\
  \ and health care providers are turning to telemedicine to enable social distancing\
  \ measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.  As a result, many health care providers\
  \ are expanding existing telehealth services and implementing new telehealth services,\
  \ and the demand for connected care services provided directly to patients in their\
  \ homes or mobile locations is skyrocketing.  In response, the Coronavirus Aid,\
  \ Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020,\
  \ provided, among a panoply of other actions, $200 million to the Federal Communications\
  \ Commission (Commission or FCC) to support health care providers in the fight against\
  \ the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  The FCC, to effectuate Congress\u2019 intent in\
  \ enacting the CARES Act, established a COVID-19 Telehealth Program (Program) to\
  \ distribute an appropriated budget of $200 million to help eligible health care\
  \ providers maximize their provision of connected care services during the COVID-19\
  \ pandemic.\n\nTo build on the success of Round 1 of the Commission\u2019s COVID-19\
  \ Telehealth Program, in the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021, Congress appropriated\
  \ an additional $249.95 million for this Program (Round 2).  First, Congress directed\
  \ the Commission to seek comment on the \u201Cmetrics the Commission should use\
  \ to evaluate applications for funding\u201D and \u201Chow the Commission should\
  \ treat applications filed during the funding rounds for awards from the [Program]\
  \ using amounts appropriated under the CARES Act . . . .\u201D   Second, it instructed\
  \ the Commission, to the extent feasible, to ensure that at least one applicant\
  \ from all 50 states and the District of Columbia is awarded funds during either\
  \ of the Program\u2019s funding rounds.  Third, the Consolidated Appropriations\
  \ Act directed the Commission to allow applicants from Round 1 the opportunity to\
  \ update or amend their applications."
