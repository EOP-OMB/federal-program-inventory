objective: 'In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, communities
  and health care providers are turning to telemedicine to enable social distancing
  measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.  As a result, many health care providers
  are expanding existing telehealth services and implementing new telehealth services,
  and the demand for connected care services provided directly to patients in their
  homes or mobile locations is skyrocketing.  In response, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,
  and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, provided,
  among a panoply of other actions, $200 million to the Federal Communications Commission
  (Commission or FCC) to support health care providers in the fight against the ongoing
  COVID-19 pandemic.  The FCC, to effectuate Congress’ intent in enacting the CARES
  Act, established a COVID-19 Telehealth Program (Program) to distribute an appropriated
  budget of $200 million to help eligible health care providers maximize their provision
  of connected care services during the COVID-19 pandemic.


  To build on the success of Round 1 of the Commission’s COVID-19 Telehealth Program,
  in the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021, Congress appropriated an additional
  $249.95 million for this Program (Round 2).  First, Congress directed the Commission
  to seek comment on the “metrics the Commission should use to evaluate applications
  for funding” and “how the Commission should treat applications filed during the
  funding rounds for awards from the [Program] using amounts appropriated under the
  CARES Act . . . .”   Second, it instructed the Commission, to the extent feasible,
  to ensure that at least one applicant from all 50 states and the District of Columbia
  is awarded funds during either of the Program’s funding rounds.  Third, the Consolidated
  Appropriations Act directed the Commission to allow applicants from Round 1 the
  opportunity to update or amend their applications.'
