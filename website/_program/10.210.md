objective: 'The purpose of the NNF Grants Program is to train students for Master’s
  and/or doctoral degrees and provide additional postdoctoral training for Fellows
  who have completed their doctoral degrees at colleges and universities that have
  demonstrable teaching and research competencies in the food and agricultural sciences.
  Fellowships and IRTA awards are specifically intended to support traineeship programs
  that encourage outstanding students to pursue and complete their degrees or obtain
  postdoctoral training in areas where there is a national need for the development
  of scientific and professional expertise in the food and agricultural sciences.  Fellowships
  and IRTA awards invest in graduate training and relevant international experiential
  learning for a cadre of diverse individuals who demonstrate their potential to successfully
  complete graduate degree programs in disciplines relevant to the mission of the
  USDA. '
