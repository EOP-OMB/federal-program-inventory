objective: ASCE addresses barriers unique to specialty crops exports. It supports
  projects that advance U.S. specialty crop exports by expanding domestic understanding
  of foreign food safety systems and foreign understanding of U.S. food safety systems.
  The initiative will also collect information needed for export certification, and
  packaging to meet other countries' new requirements.
