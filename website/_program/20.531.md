    \ on transit buses part of the Crime Prevention and Public Safety Awareness Program.\
    \  The objective of having officers on board will help to identify and reduce\
    \ any instances of human trafficking, protect transit operators from risk of assault,\
    \ reduce crime on transit vehicles and at transit facilities, and improve rider\
    \ as well as public safety.  This effort is part of FTA\u2019s Human Trafficking\
    \ Awareness and Public Safety Initiative. \n\n2) FTA funded the National Transit\
    \ Institute (NTI).  NTI transitioned 18 courses to a virtual platform.  NTI delivered\

    \ FTA staff attendance at the TRB Annual Meeting and access to TRB reports and\
    \ webinars. This project included strong FTA staff attendance at the TRB Annual\
    \ Meeting and providing FTA staff with access to all online TRB resources, including\
    \ the Transportation Research International Documentation (TRID) database. Research\
    \ sponsors use TRID to avoid costly duplication and assure timely dissemination\
    \ of results. TRB processes approximately 30,000 new transportation-related publications\
    \ into TRID per year. FTA also sponsored the TRANSED accessibility, mobility,\
    \ and demand response international virtual conference.\n\n4) FTA successfully\
    \ entered into an agreement for the project Bus Exportable Power Systems (BEPS)\
    \ standards that enables public transportation agencies, communities, and States\
    \ to access resilient and flexible power options through hybrid electric bus fleet\
    \ vehicles during major power disruptions. FTA hosted a webinar on the Standard\
    \ Development for Bus Exportable Power Systems Notice of Funding Opportunity.\
    \ FTA announced the recipient selected for award.\n\n5) FTA funded the National\
    \ Center for Applied Transit Technology (N-CATT) and relevant activities in FY\
    \ 2022 include developing resources to help rural, small-urban, and tribal transit\
    \ providers understand the benefits of emerging technology and how to use the\
    \ technology in their own transit systems. The resources developed included reports,\
    \ training, online tools, podcasts, fact sheets, webinars, and in-person workshops.\
    \ N-CATT also provided direct technical assistance at the state and local levels\
