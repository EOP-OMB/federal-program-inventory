    \ the Technical Assistance and Workforce Development in areas such as Technical\
    \ Assistance, Standards Development, Human Resources/Workforce, and Training.\
    \  Projects funded accomplishments during FY 2020 include:\n\n1).  The National\
    \ Transit Institute (NTI) delivered 170 training courses both on-site and virtually\
    \ to 6,459 participants. NTI witnessed a reduction of training courses delivered\
    \ and course participants in FY 2020 because of course cancellations due to the\
    \ COVID-19 pandemic.  NTI is now expanding its virtual course delivery capabilities,\
    \ online, and webinar-based portfolio.   \n\n2).  The National Aging and Disability\
    \ Transportation Center (NADTC), launched online courses, conducted webinars,\
    \ provided targeted technical assistance, published a newsletter, and developed\
    \ publicly available resources. Also, NADTC conducted a national survey of core\
    \ constituencies to identify transportation needs of older adults and people with\
    \ disabilities and provide grant assistance to local communities for implementation\
    \ of innovative transportation solutions and creating replicable models of excellence.\
    \ Approximately 847 people participated in NADTC online courses and webinars and\
    \ more than 390 attended conference presentations given by NADTC staff.  \n\n\
    3).  The National Center for Mobility Management (NCMM) accomplished the following\
    \ activities in FY 2020: held webinars and information sharing sessions, developed\
    \ e-learning training courses, developed publicly available materials/guides,\
    \ and provided technical assistance to public transit agencies through various\
    \ methods. It helped train mobility management practitioners on emerging service\
    \ models and new technologies that increase mobility and also supported the Coordinating\
    \ Council on Access and Mobility (CCAM). \n\n4).  The Transit Automation Technical\
    \ Assistance program produced an internal technical assistance needs assessment\
    \ findings document and developed a framework/scope for the Community of Practice\
    \ Initiative. Through this program, FTA has been developing a greater understanding\
    \ of the state of transit bus automation and the potential opportunities for transit\
    \ bus automation to improve safety and performance.\n\n5).  The Crime Prevention\
    \ and Public Safety Awareness program, a component of FTA’s Human Trafficking\
    \ Awareness and Public Safety Initiative, selected three organizations to receive\
    \ funding through cooperative agreements to develop and disseminate technical\
    \ assistance materials supporting public safety awareness campaigns that address\

    FTA supports various types of projects under  Technical Assistance and Workforce\
    \ Development.  Projects in the areas Technical Assistance, Standards Development,\
    \ Human Resources/Workforce, and Training.    Accomplishments FUNDED in FY 2021\
    \ include:\n\n1) The National Transit Institute (NTI).  FTA funded the National\
    \ Transit Institute (NTI) and NTI delivered 162 training courses virtually to\
    \ 6,177 transit and transportation professionals. Between lockdowns, shut-downs,\
    \ quarantines, and closures, COVID-19 changed the way training is delivered. Even\
    \ though NTI experienced a sharp reduction in the delivery of training courses\
    \ compared to pre-COVID years, NTI quickly made drastic adjustments and successfully\
    \ delivered some training courses to the public transportation industry.  NTI\
    \ continues to expand its virtual course portfolio with plans to continue 100%\
    \ virtual course delivery until January 2022 and, potentially, resume a limited\
    \ scheduled of on-site course offerings soon after.  \n\n2) Transit Workforce\
    \ Center.  FTA announced a notice of funding opportunity and awarded the Transit\
    \ Workforce (TWC) in FY 2021.  The TWC has assisted over 20 transit agencies and\
    \ through their webinars reached several thousand people providing technical assistance\
    \ to address the critical transit workforce shortages.  \n \n3) TRB CORE Program.\
    \ FTA funded the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Core Program to support FTA\
    \ staff attendance at the TRB Annual Meeting and access to TRB reports and webinars.\
    \  This project provided FTA staff with access to all online TRB resources including\
    \ the Transportation Research International Documentation (TRID) database.  General\
    \ support for 175 TRB standing committees and TRB processes approximately 30,000\
    \ new transportation-related publications into TRID per year. \n\n4)  Transit\
    \ Survey Data Archiving and Analysis.  FTA funded the Transit Survey Data Archiving\
    \ and Analysis project to prevent valuable transportation datasets from becoming\
    \ lost or destroyed and to make these data available for legitimate research while\
    \ at the same time safeguarding survey participants privacy.  The project focused\
    \ on establishing a standardized workflow to convert transit survey databases\
    \ into the Transportation Secure Data Center (TSDC) and reconfiguring the TSDC\
    \ website and secure portal environment to provide navigable branches for accessing\
    \ transit survey data. Through this project, FTA will provide opportunities for\
    \ research and others with an interest in transit to better understand the characteristics\
    \ and travel patterns of the users of public transit.  \n\n5) The National Aging\
    \ and Disability Transportation Center (NADTC).   The National Aging and Disability\
    \ Transportation Center (NADTC) promoted the mobility of people with disabilities\
    \ and older adults, ensuring that public transportation supports independent living\
    \ in communities. NADTC completed a national diversity, equity and inclusion initiative;\
    \ conducted a coordination campaign including a national coordination committee;\
    \ provided online courses, webinars, and targeted technical assistance; hosted\
    \ a learning collaborative published a monthly newsletter and monthly blogs; actively\
    \ participated on social media; maintained an updated website; and developed useful\
    \ resources including an annual trends report. NADTS’s activities achieved broad\
    \ outreach.  Approximately 2,237 people."
