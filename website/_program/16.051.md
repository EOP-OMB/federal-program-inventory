results:
- description: To date, grant-funded efforts have focused on developing frameworks
    for several potential full-semester courses, certificate courses, and continuing
    education programs for law enforcement. These courses provide foundational instruction
    on the principles of NIBIN and crime gun intelligence, as well as complex investigations
    involving criminal organizations. Additionally, WSU has developed several accredited
    training programs for law enforcement, prosecutors, and other criminal justice
    professionals, as well as a robust internship program with all partnering agencies,
    including CGICs, labs, District Attorney’s offices, U.S. Attorney’s offices, corrections,
    probation/parole, and local police departments. The ability to educate broad audiences
    on forensics, NIBIN, and crime gun intelligence impacts communities negatively
    impacted by firearm violence. NIBIN is an unbiased way of identifying the most
    prolific shooters and the collaborative partnerships among local, state, and federal
    partners have led to more effective gun crime investigations and improved strategic
    efforts surrounding resource allocation. Developing standard education and training
    expands the knowledge base of crime gun intelligence and increases the number
    of professionals using these advanced investigative methods.
