objective: This program provides funding to state and tribal courts to improve the
  quality of court processes and legal representation. The program provides courts
  flexibility to design assessments which identify barriers to timely and effective
  decision-making, highlight practices which are not fully successful, examine areas
  they find to be in need of correction or added attention, and then implement reforms
  which address specific needs. State courts are required to collaborate with the
  state child welfare agency and tribes in this work. The program also provides funding
  for tribal court recipients through discretionary awards.
