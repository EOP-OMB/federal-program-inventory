objective: Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Funding to Alleviate Emergency Supply
  Chain Disruption in the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) provides CSFP
  State agencies and Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) with funding to purchase of
  domestically grown and produced foods. These funds enable State agencies to alleviate
  supply chain challenges and national warehouse delays, which are impacting CSFP
  inventory levels and more broadly, the availability of a sufficient variety and
  quantity of food resources for participants.
