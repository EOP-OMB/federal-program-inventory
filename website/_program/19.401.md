objective: "As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and\
  \ Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people\
  \ of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational\
  \ and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers,\
  \ professionals, students, and educators. ECA programs foster engagement and encourage\
  \ dialogue with citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is\
  \ premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of leaders\
  \ and future leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies\
  \ and affect official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today. ECA\
  \ programs inform, engage, and influence participants across strategic sectors of\
  \ society \u2013 including young people, women, teachers, scholars, journalists,\
  \ and other professionals \u2013 increasing the number of  individuals who have\
  \ first-hand international experience  with the values of freedom, representative\
  \ government, rule of law, economic choice, and individual dignity, while building\
  \ international knowledge and capacity among  people globally  The Fulbright Scholar\
  \ Program offers opportunities for American and foreign scholars to conduct research,\
  \ lecture, and/or consult with other scholars and institutions in the  United States\
  \   and abroad. The Study of the U.S. Institutes for Scholars and Secondary Educators\
  \ strengthens curricula and improves the quality of teaching about the United States\
  \ in academic institutions overseas."
