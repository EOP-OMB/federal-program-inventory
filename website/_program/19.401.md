objective: As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational and
  Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people
  of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and
  cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals,
  students, and educators. ECA programs foster engagement and encourage dialogue with
  citizens around the world. Educational and cultural engagement is premised on the
  knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of leaders and future leaders,
  and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making
  almost everywhere in the world today. ECA programs inform, engage, and influence
  participants across strategic sectors of society – including young people, women,
  teachers, scholars, journalists, and other professionals – increasing the number
  of  individuals who have first-hand international experience  with the values of
  freedom, representative government, rule of law, economic choice, and individual
  dignity, while building international knowledge and capacity among  people globally  The
  Fulbright Scholar Program offers opportunities for American and foreign scholars
  to conduct research, lecture, and/or consult with other scholars and institutions
  in the  United States   and abroad. The Study of the U.S. Institutes for Scholars
  and Secondary Educators strengthens curricula and improves the quality of teaching
  about the United States in academic institutions overseas.
