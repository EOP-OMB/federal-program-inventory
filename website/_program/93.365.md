results:
- description: In FY 20, the Sickle Cell Treatment Demonstration Program served more
    than 25,000 individuals living with sickle cell disease(SCD) across the United
    States. Providers participating in the program prescribed hydroxyurea (a disease-modifying
    therapy) to 70% of their pediatric population and 14% of their pediatric population
    with other disease-modifying treatments. 57% of their adult patients received
    hydroxyurea prescriptions and 33% of their adult patients received other disease
    modifying therapy prescriptions. Furthermore, SCD providers indicated that 65%
    of eligible individuals with SCD (ages 2-16) had a transcranial doppler screening
    within the past 15 months, an important tool for detecting stroke risk which is
    elevated in individuals with SCD.
