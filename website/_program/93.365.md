- description: Sickle Cell Treatment Demonstration Program served more than 25,000
    individuals living with sickle cell disease(SCD) across the United States. Providers
    participating in the program prescribed hydroxyurea (a disease-modifying therapy)
    to 70% of their pediatric population and 14% of their pediatric population with
    other disease-modifying treatments. 57% of their adult patients received hydroxyurea
    prescriptions and 33% of their adult patients received other disease modifying
    therapy prescriptions. Furthermore, SCD providers indicated that 65% of eligible
    individuals with SCD (ages 2-16) had a transcranial doppler screening within the
    past 15 months, an important tool for detecting stroke risk which is elevated
    in individuals with SCD.
