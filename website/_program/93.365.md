  complications, including the coordination of service delivery for individuals with
  sickle cell disease; genetic counseling and testing; bundling of technical services
  related to the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease; training of health
  professionals; and identifying and establishing efforts related to the expansion
  and coordination of education, treatment, and continuity of care for individuals
  with Sickle Cell Disease as authorized in 42 USC Section 300b-5(b) (Section 1106(b)

  year: '2020'
- description: Sickle Cell Treatment Demonstration Program served more than 25,000
    individuals living with sickle cell disease(SCD) across the United States. Providers
    participating in the program prescribed hydroxyurea (a disease-modifying therapy)
    to 70% of their pediatric population and 14% of their pediatric population with
    other disease-modifying treatments. 57% of their adult patients received hydroxyurea
    prescriptions and 33% of their adult patients received other disease modifying
    therapy prescriptions. Furthermore, SCD providers indicated that 65% of eligible
    individuals with SCD (ages 2-16) had a transcranial doppler screening within the
    past 15 months, an important tool for detecting stroke risk which is elevated
    in individuals with SCD.

    States. Providers participating in the program prescribed  disease-modifying therapies
    to more than 75% of their patient population. Furthermore, almost 3,800 providers
    participated in SCD-based Project ECHO sessions or telementoring calls, which
    helps expand the number of providers with improved SCD knowledge and care tools
    and resources.
