objective: "To provide technical assistance and funds, on a cost-share basis, for\
  \ projects that enhance opportunities for sustained forest products production for\
  \ primary and secondary wood industries located in the eastern hardwood forest region\
  \ of the United States. In order to maintain and improve the health and stewardship\
  \ of our Nation's forests, local wood-using industries need to be vibrant and able\
  \ to utilize a wide variety of resources from the forest. Priorities include: \r\
  \n\r\n• Maintain the economic competitiveness of primary and secondary wood industries.\
  \  Examples include:\r\n1) Encouraging the adoption of new technology to improve\
  \ competitiveness and profitability, \r\n2) Bringing information and technology\
  \ about processing, marketing, and business-related skills as well as urban wood\
  \ utilization to existing and emerging businesses, and\r\n3) Developing utilization\
  \ options that improve forest stewardship and health.\r\n4) Support activities that\
  \ maintain or enhance harvesting industry capacity to serve the wood industry.\r\
  \n\r\n• Increase the knowledge and information about how the wood industry can contribute\
  \ to the green building movement.  Examples include chain of custody certification\
  \ for sustainable wood products as well as life cycle analysis for a range of wood\
  \ products.  \r\n\r\n• Increase the knowledge, information, and promotion of how\
  \ carbon sequestration by wood products can provide a competitive edge to a sustainable\
  \ forest products industry.  An example includes developing specific carbon storage\
  \ factors for a range of wood products.\r\n\r\n• Develop technology and markets\
  \ to address urgent issues on a global or domestic scale, including:           \
  \   \r\n1) Sanitizing wood packaging materials, firewood, and similar products to\
  \ eliminate these pathways for the transport of insect and disease pests, and  \
  \                                                                       \r\n2) Developing\
  \ markets for and using unexpected increases in the volume of urban and rural wood\
  \ due to new pest introductions (for example, emerald ash borer) and weather events\
  \ such as tornadoes and ice storms. \r\n\r\n• Increase the sustainable use of woody\
  \ biomass to meet our Nation’s needs for energy, raw materials, and reductions of\
  \ hazardous fuels.  Examples include public/private partnerships for using woody\
  \ biomass in heating and cooling, process energy, cogeneration, district energy\
  \ systems, and solid and liquid fuel production.  Projects may also develop or maintain\
  \ local markets and forest industry infrastructure by using woody biomass for both\
  \ energy and value-added products.  Provide key information to address the economic,\
  \ social and ecological aspects of woody biomass production and use: including sustainable\
  \ supplies, harvesting techniques, forest management, plantation development, and\
  \ environmental implications. \r\n"
