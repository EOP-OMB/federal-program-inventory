objective: "To provide technical assistance and funds, on a cost-share basis, for\
  \ projects that enhance opportunities for sustained forest products production for\
  \ primary and secondary wood industries located in the eastern hardwood forest region\
  \ of the United States. In order to maintain and improve the health and stewardship\
  \ of our Nation's forests, local wood-using industries need to be vibrant and able\
  \ to utilize a wide variety of resources from the forest. Priorities include: \r\
  \n\r\n\u2022 Maintain the economic competitiveness of primary and secondary wood\
  \ industries.  Examples include:\r\n1) Encouraging the adoption of new technology\
  \ to improve competitiveness and profitability, \r\n2) Bringing information and\
  \ technology about processing, marketing, and business-related skills as well as\
  \ urban wood utilization to existing and emerging businesses, and\r\n3) Developing\
  \ utilization options that improve forest stewardship and health.\r\n4) Support\
  \ activities that maintain or enhance harvesting industry capacity to serve the\
  \ wood industry.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Increase the knowledge and information about how\
  \ the wood industry can contribute to the green building movement.  Examples include\
  \ chain of custody certification for sustainable wood products as well as life cycle\
  \ analysis for a range of wood products.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Increase the knowledge,\
  \ information, and promotion of how carbon sequestration by wood products can provide\
  \ a competitive edge to a sustainable forest products industry.  An example includes\
  \ developing specific carbon storage factors for a range of wood products.\r\n\r\
  \n\u2022 Develop technology and markets to address urgent issues on a global or\
  \ domestic scale, including:              \r\n1) Sanitizing wood packaging materials,\
  \ firewood, and similar products to eliminate these pathways for the transport of\
  \ insect and disease pests, and                                                \
  \                         \r\n2) Developing markets for and using unexpected increases\
  \ in the volume of urban and rural wood due to new pest introductions (for example,\
  \ emerald ash borer) and weather events such as tornadoes and ice storms. \r\n\r\
  \n\u2022 Increase the sustainable use of woody biomass to meet our Nation\u2019\
  s needs for energy, raw materials, and reductions of hazardous fuels.  Examples\
  \ include public/private partnerships for using woody biomass in heating and cooling,\
  \ process energy, cogeneration, district energy systems, and solid and liquid fuel\
  \ production.  Projects may also develop or maintain local markets and forest industry\
  \ infrastructure by using woody biomass for both energy and value-added products.\
  \  Provide key information to address the economic, social and ecological aspects\
  \ of woody biomass production and use: including sustainable supplies, harvesting\
  \ techniques, forest management, plantation development, and environmental implications.\
  \ \r\n"
