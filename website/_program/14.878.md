rules_regulations: Authorizing legislation in Section 24 of the 1937 Housing Act is
  extremely detailed. No regulations have been published. Main Street housing development
  is processed using HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing Mixed-finance regulations
  detailed in 24 CFR 905.600, or HOPE VI homeownership regulations under Section 24
  of the 1937 Act. Each grant is subject to the terms of its NOFO and Grant Agreement,
  which is the contract signed by the Grantee and HUD. HUD posts guidance on its Main
  Street website at https://www.hud.gov/mainstreet  with links to Main Street's most
  recent NOFO, program summaries, general guidance materials, mixed-finance guidance
  materials, and relevant statutes, regulations and notices. This web site provides
  Grantees with information on timelines, budgets, financial instructions, and other
  program guidance.
