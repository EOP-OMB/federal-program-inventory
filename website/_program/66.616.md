objective: The objective of this program is to provide financial assistance to eligible
  entities to support environmental and climate justice efforts under Clean Air Act
  (CAA) Section 138 which was added to the CAA by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
  EPAâ€™s new Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants program (Community
  Change Grants) announced a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) that remained open
  for 12 months, closing on November 21, 2024, to fund approximately $2 billion dollars
  in Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funds in environmental and climate justice activities
  to benefit disadvantaged communities through projects that reduce pollution, increase
  community climate resilience, and build community capacity to address environmental
  and climate justice challenges. These place-based investments will be focused on
  community-driven initiatives to be responsive to community and stakeholder input.
  This program is designed to deliver on the transformative potential of the IRA for
  communities most adversely and disproportionately impacted by climate change, legacy
  pollution, and historical disinvestments.
