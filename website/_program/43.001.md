objective: 'The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) pursues NASA''s strategic objectives,
  particularly Strategic Goal 1: “Expand Human Knowledge through new Scientific Discoveries”,
  using aircraft, balloon, and spaceflight programs to enable the execution of both
  remote-sensing and in-situ investigations. Investigations in Earth orbit, as well
  as to or even beyond objects in the Solar System, and through ground-based research
  activities that directly support these space missions. SMD also supports basic and
  applied research and technology in order to understand naturally occurring space
  and Earth phenomena, human-induced changes in the Earth system, and to develop Earth
  and space science-related technologies. In March 2022 NASA released a new Strategic
  Plan. Per that 2022 plan

  SMD’s Assistance Listing aligns to this Goal Statement: “NASA’s enduring purpose
  is scientific discovery and exploration for the benefit of the United States and
  all of humanity. NASA seeks to discover the secrets of the universe, search for
  life elsewhere, and protect and improve life on Earth and in space. Finding answers
  to these profound science questions requires support for national priorities in
  science and exploration, enhancing new opportunities for cross-disciplinary science,
  and expanding the societal benefits of our science programs. It also requires continued
  progress on the scientific priorities, including those identified by the National
  Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine through their decadal surveys.”


  SMD uses NASA''s Strategic Goals and Objectives and the high-level objectives that
  flow from them as the performance component to its research grant program notices
  of funding opportunity. The high-level objectives are derived from “Decadal Surveys”
  created by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) every
  ten years and reviewed every five years. NASEM reports summarize the state of the
  performance for SMD’s science awards. Decadal Surveys inform the NASA’s strategic
  and SMD science plan and allow grant programs to be kept up to date rather than
  be completely reliant on agency produced program goals and objectives and performance
  measures.  SMD’s research awardees individually set appropriate, NASA-relevant  project
  level objectives, goals and measures.'
