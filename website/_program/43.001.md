objective: "The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) pursues NASA's strategic objectives,\
  \ particularly Strategic Goal 1: \u201CExpand Human Knowledge through new Scientific\
  \ Discoveries\u201D, using aircraft, balloon, and spaceflight programs to enable\
  \ the execution of both remote-sensing and in-situ investigations. Investigations\
  \ in Earth orbit, as well as to or even beyond objects in the Solar System, and\
  \ through ground-based research activities that directly support these space missions.\
  \ SMD also supports basic and applied research and technology in order to understand\
  \ naturally occurring space and Earth phenomena, human-induced changes in the Earth\
  \ system, and to develop Earth and space science-related technologies. In March\
  \ 2022 NASA released a new Strategic Plan. Per that 2022 plan\nSMD\u2019s Assistance\
  \ Listing aligns to this Goal Statement: \u201CNASA\u2019s enduring purpose is scientific\
  \ discovery and exploration for the benefit of the United States and all of humanity.\
  \ NASA seeks to discover the secrets of the universe, search for life elsewhere,\
  \ and protect and improve life on Earth and in space. Finding answers to these profound\
  \ science questions requires support for national priorities in science and exploration,\
  \ enhancing new opportunities for cross-disciplinary science, and expanding the\
  \ societal benefits of our science programs. It also requires continued progress\
  \ on the scientific priorities, including those identified by the National Academies\
  \ of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine through their decadal surveys.\u201D\n\n\
  SMD uses NASA's Strategic Goals and Objectives and the high-level objectives that\
  \ flow from them as the performance component to its research grant program notices\
  \ of funding opportunity. The high-level objectives are derived from \u201CDecadal\
  \ Surveys\u201D created by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine\
  \ (NASEM) every ten years and reviewed every five years. NASEM reports summarize\
  \ the state of the performance for SMD\u2019s science awards. Decadal Surveys inform\
  \ the NASA\u2019s strategic and SMD science plan and allow grant programs to be\
  \ kept up to date rather than be completely reliant on agency produced program goals\
  \ and objectives and performance measures.  SMD\u2019s research awardees individually\
  \ set appropriate, NASA-relevant  project level objectives, goals and measures."
