objective: This Notice outlines opportunities to partner with the Farm Service Agency
  (FSA) to promote awareness, increase understanding among landowners and program
  participants, and increase enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program-Transition
  Incentives Program (CRP-TIP). CRP-TIP provides landowners and operators with an
  incentive to return land to production on an expiring CRP contract by transitioning
  the farmland to beginning farmer operators. It also provides an opportunity for
  beginning, veteran, and historically underserved farmers and ranchers to secure
  land access through farmland purchase or long-term lease.
