objective: CCAP provides assistance to eligible owners or designated marketing agents
  of U.S. agricultural products for eligible shipping containers from the Port of
  Oakland and designated ports associated with the Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA).  To
  ensure owners of American-grown agricultural products are able to ship their products
  from U.S. ports to global markets, the program will support improved use of empty
  shipping containers, along with the prepositioning and temporary storage of filled
  containers near export terminals, to ensure agricultural shippers can deliver products
  to their customers.
