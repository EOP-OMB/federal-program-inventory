objective: 'The objective of these grants is to provide financial assistance to eligible
  States and Tribes, those that have Primary Enforcement Responsibility for the Public
  Water System Supervision (PWSS) Program, for implementation and enforcement of the
  requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act that apply to public water systems.
  In cases where a State or a Tribe does not have a Primary Enforcement Responsibility
  program, EPA is authorized to use funds that would have otherwise been made available
  to the State or the Tribe to assist it in direct implementation of the PWSS program.
  The fundamental goal of the PWSS Program, and the grants, is to ensure that public
  water systems comply with the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations listed
  in 40 CFR 141. State drinking water agencies, which have Primary Enforcement Responsibility
  for the PWSS Program, and Indian Tribes that receive PWSS grants are to use them
  to ensure that public drinking water systems, of all types, and of all sizes: (1)
  are currently in compliance with the drinking water regulations and remain in compliance,
  (2) are working towards and in the process of achieving compliance when these systems
  are noncompliant, and (3) are preparing for future compliance with any new drinking
  water regulations that will be taking effect in the current or following year. Furthermore,
  State drinking water agencies, which have Primary Enforcement Responsibility for
  the PWSS Program, and Indian Tribes that receive PWSS grants are required to use
  the funds to update and maintain its PWSS program to comply with the National Primary
  Drinking Water Regulations Implementation requirements listed in 40 CFR 142 to ensure
  that the State or Tribal PWSS program is capable of conducting oversight of all
  public water systems as new drinking water rules, new public water systems, and/or
  drinking water program requirements become effective.  Funding Priority - Fiscal
  Year 2023:  The priority for the PWSS grants is to ensure that the population served
  by community water systems will receive drinking water that meets all applicable
  health-based drinking water standards. This includes ensuring public water systems
  implement and comply with all drinking water rules, including carefully considering
  any simultaneous compliance issues. Furthermore, EPA''s priority is for States and
  Tribal PWSS Programs to meet the primary enforcement responsibilities. The primary
  components of a State or Tribal PWSS program are: (1) the adoption and implementation
  of State and Indian Tribe drinking water regulations at least as stringent as the
  Federal regulations; (2) the development and maintenance of database(s) of an inventory
  of public water systems and housing of public water system compliance information;
  (3) the conduct of sanitary surveys, which identifies sanitary deficiencies and
  requires that these deficiencies to be addressed, at public water systems; (4) the
  establishment and maintenance of a laboratory certification program for approval
  of laboratories to perform analyses of drinking water contaminants/analytes, including
  the assurance of adequate laboratory capacity to perform drinking water analyses;
  (5) the review of public water system plans and specifications; (6) the establishment
  of legal enforcement and authority to assess penalties to compel public water systems''
  compliance with the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; (7) the adoption
  of regulations consistent with 40 CFR part 3 which deals with electronic documents;
  and (8) the adoption and implementation of an adequate plan for providing safe drinking
  water during emergency circumstances. In Fiscal Year 2021, of the funds provided,
  $10,000,000 is to further support States, Territories, and Tribes in addressing
  PFAS and other contaminants of emerging concern as they carry out their Public Water
  System Supervision programs.'
