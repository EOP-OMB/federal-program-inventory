objective: 'The objective of these grants is to provide financial assistance to eligible
  States and Tribes, those that have Primary Enforcement Responsibility for the Public
  Water System Supervision (PWSS) Program, for implementation and enforcement of the
  requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act that apply to public water systems.
  In cases where a State or a Tribe does not have a Primary Enforcement Responsibility
  program, EPA is authorized to use funds that would have otherwise been made available
  to the State or the Tribe to assist it in direct implementation of the PWSS program.
  The fundamental goal of the PWSS Program, and the grants, is to ensure that public
  water systems comply with the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations listed
  in 40 CFR 141. State drinking water agencies, which have Primary Enforcement Responsibility
  for the PWSS Program, and Indian Tribes that receive PWSS grants are to use them
  to ensure that public drinking water systems, of all types, and of all sizes: (1)
  are currently in compliance with the drinking water regulations and remain in compliance,
  (2) are working towards and in the process of achieving compliance when these systems
  are noncompliant, and (3) are preparing for future compliance with any new drinking
  water regulations that will be taking effect in the current or following year. Furthermore,
  State drinking water agencies, which have Primary Enforcement Responsibility for
  the PWSS Program, and Indian Tribes that receive PWSS grants are required to use
  the funds to update and maintain its PWSS program to comply with the National Primary
  Drinking Water Regulations Implementation requirements listed in 40 CFR 142 to ensure
  that the State or Tribal PWSS program is capable of conducting oversight of all
  public water systems as new drinking water rules, new public water systems, and/or
  drinking water program requirements become effective.'
