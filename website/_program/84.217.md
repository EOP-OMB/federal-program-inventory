objective: To provide grants for institutions of higher education to prepare participants
  for doctoral studies through involvement in research and other scholarly activities.
  Participants are from disadvantaged backgrounds and have demonstrated strong academic
  potential. Institutions work closely with participants as they complete their undergraduate
  requirements. Institutions encourage participants to enroll in graduate programs
  and then track their progress through to the successful completion of advanced degrees.
  The goal is to increase the attainment of Ph.D. degrees by students from underrepresented
  segments of society.
