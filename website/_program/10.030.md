objective: "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service administers regulations at\
  \ 9 CFR parts 50 to 54 that authorizes payment for indemnities.  This authority\
  \ covers a wide variety of indemnity situations ranging from large livestock depopulations\
  \ to small fowl depopulations, and there are various indemnity calculations and\
  \ processes for determining the indemnity value for each specific species.  The\
  \ Secretary of Agriculture offers an opinion that constitutes an emergency and threatens\
  \ the U.S. animal population.  Payment for the destroyed animals is based on fair\
  \ market value.  Also, under Section 415 (e) of the Plant Protection Act (Title\
  \ IV of Public Law 106-224), under a declaration of extraordinary emergency because\
  \ of the presence of a plant pest or noxious weed that is new to or not known to\
  \ be widely prevalent in the United States, the Secretary may pay compensation for\
  \ economic losses incurred by as a result of actions taken under the authorities\
  \ in this section (415).\r\n"
