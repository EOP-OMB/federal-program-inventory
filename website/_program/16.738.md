objective: "Goal: Provide states, tribes, and units of local government with additional\
  \ personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical assistance,\
  \ and information systems for criminal justice. \n\nObjective(s): The Edward Byrne\
  \ Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) is a formula grant program that provides\
  \ states, tribes, and local governments with critical funding necessary to support\
  \ a range of program areas including law enforcement; prosecution and court; prevention\
  \ and education; corrections and community corrections, including reentry; drug\
  \ treatment and enforcement; planning, evaluation, and technology improvement; crime\
  \ victim and witness initiatives; and mental health programs and related law enforcement\
  \ and corrections programs, including behavioral programs and crisis intervention\
  \ teams. JAG also supports the implementation of state crisis intervention court\
  \ proceedings and related programs or initiatives, including but not limited to\
  \ mental health courts, drug courts, veterans courts, and extreme risk protection\
  \ order programs. \n\nJAG project grants may address precipitous increases in crime\
  \ and/or training and technical assistance, and may be specified for a particular\
  \ criminal justice use such as compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA)\
  \ or the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA).\n\nNote:  BJA is\
  \ currently re-developing its key performance measures for the JAG program."
