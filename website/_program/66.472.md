objective: To assist Coastal and Great Lakes States, Territories, and Tribes eligible
  under Section 518(e) of the Clean Water Act, as amended, in developing and implementing
  programs that monitor bacterial water quality and notify the public for coastal
  recreation waters adjacent to beaches or similar points of access that are used
  by the public. EPA's funding priority is to award grants to (1) applicants whose
  proposals clearly demonstrate a state's, tribe's, territory's, or local government's
  ability to monitor coastal and Great Lakes recreational waters; notify the public
  of risks; manage programs; and communicate among environmental and public health
  agencies and the public and (2) applicants eligible to develop a program to do these
  actions.

- description: 'In FY 16, grants will continue to support the development and implementation
    of recreational water quality monitoring and notification programs or support
    enhancement of an existing program. FY 16 is a year when states provide schedules
    for the adoption of the 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria into their WQS
    and for implementing updated beach notification thresholds reflecting the content
    of the 2012 RWQC and the 2014 Beach Guidance. In FY 16, EPA awarded grants to
    all 35 coastal and Great Lakes states and territories and three eligible tribes
    that qualified for the BEACH Act Grant program. Program benefits from funding
    in FY 16 include: development and implementation of recreational water quality
    monitoring protocol (sampling design, indicator organism); decreasing swimmer
    exposure by improving communication outreach and education to public on swimming
    advisories; establishing more efficient and timely management decision process
    for posting swimming advisories; and constructing databases to provide government
    and public access to data and information. '
