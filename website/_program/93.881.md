objective: "The Reduction of Issuer Burden Through Technology Grant will provide funding\
  \ to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to build an IT connection\
  \ between the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) and the Unified\
  \ Rate Review (URR) module in the Health Insurance and Oversight System (HIOS) to\
  \ increase the efficiency of federal processes and reduce the administrative burden\
  \ imposed on health insurance issuers and state regulators at Departments of Insurance.\n\
  \nThe Health Insurance Enforcement and Consumer Protections grants was awarded in\
  \ 2016 and provided a funding source to assist states in implementing and planning\
  \ several of the federal market reforms and consumer protections under Part A of\
  \ Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). The Health Insurance Enforcement\
  \ and Consumer Protections grants provided states with the opportunity to ensure\
  \ their laws, regulations, and procedures are in line with federal requirements\
  \ and that states are able to effectively oversee and enforce the PHS Act\u2019\
  s title XXVII Part A provisions with respect to health insurance issuers."
