    family members, or approximately  24% of the total annual interments in all national,
    state, territory, and tribal cemeteries (176,965). In 2022, the program opened
    one new state cemetery, Seaman First Class Billy Turner Ardmore Veterans Cemetery
    in Ardmore, OK and one new tribal Veterans cemetery, Annette Island Reserve Veterans
    Cemetery in Metlakatla, AK. In 2023, with VA’s grant funding, Minnesota dedicated
    the State Veterans Cemetery at Redwood Falls in rural Southwestern Minnesota.
    These three cemeteries provide a burial option to 29,563 unserved Veterans and
    their eligible family members.
