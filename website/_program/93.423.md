objective: Under Section 1332 of the ACA, states can apply for State Innovation Waivers
  (also referred to as section 1332 waivers) and pursue innovative strategies to adapt
  many of the law's requirements to suit the state's specific needs. To receive approval,
  the state must demonstrate that a proposed section 1332 waiver meets the statutory
  guardrails to provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the coverage
  provided without the waiver; provides coverage and cost-sharing protections against
  excessive out-of-pocket spending that are at least as affordable as without the
  waiver; provides coverage to at least a comparable number of residents as without
  the waiver; and does not increase the federal deficit. Before submitting its section
  1332 waiver application the state must also provide a public notice and comment
  period, including public hearings, sufficient to ensure a meaningful level of public
  input, and enact a law providing for implementation of the waiver. Under a section
  1332 waiver, a state may receive pass-through funding associated with the resulting
  reductions in federal spending on Exchange financial assistance consistent with
  the statute.

rules_regulations: "Regulations governing the application process for State Innovation\
  \ Waivers can be found at the Federal Register at: 77 Fed. Reg. 11700 (Feb. 27,\
  \ 2012); 80 Fed. Reg. 78131 (Dec. 16, 2015; ‘2015 Guidance’); 83 Fed. Reg. 53575\
  \ (Oct. 24, 2018; ‘2018 Guidance’); 85 Fed. Reg. 71142 (Nov. 6, 2020); 85 Fed. Reg.\
  \ 78572 (Dec. 4, 2020); 86 Fed. Reg. 6138 (Jan. 19, 2021); 86 Fed. Reg. 53412 (Sept.\
  \ 27, 2021); 89 Fed. Reg. 26229 (Apr. 15, 2024). Among other things, these regulations\
  \ provide guidance on how to apply for a waiver and what an application from a state\
  \ must contain, including actuarial and economic analyses. The regulations detail\
  \ public notice and comment requirements that a state must comply with before an\
  \ application is submitted, including holding public hearings in order to facilitate\
  \ a meaningful level of public involvement, input, and transparency in the state\
  \ application process. They also describe the Federal public notice and comment\
  \ process that will occur after the Departments have determined an application is\
  \ complete. The regulations also describe the requirements for post-award reporting\
  \ and the standards under which post-award monitoring will take place. Additionally,\
  \ the regulations describe the requirements for waiver extension requests and amendments.\n\
  On February 27, 2012, the Departments promulgated final implementing regulations\
  \ for the section 1332 waiver application and review process.\n\nOn July 15, 2019,\
  \ CMS published a section 1332 waiver checklist to help states develop and complete\
  \ application requirements. This checklist itemized the elements required for a\
  \ waiver application, including information about waiver concepts and citations\
  \ to  relevant regulatory provisions.\nOn November 6, 2020, the Departments published\
  \ an interim final rule with request for comments (85 FR 71142, November 2020 IFC),\
  \ which revised regulations to set forth flexibilities in the public notice requirements\
  \ and post-award public participation requirements for waivers under section 1332\
  \ during the COVID-19 PHE. \n \nOn September 27, 2021, the Departments published\
  \ the final rule “Updating Payment Parameters, Section 1332 Waiver Implementing\
  \ Regulations, and Improving Health Insurance Markets for 2022 and Beyond” as part\
  \ 3 of the HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2022 (part 3 of the\
  \ 2022 Payment Notice final rule), which supersedes and replaces the policies and\
  \ interpretations outlined in the prior, 2018 guidance. The Departments finalized\
  \ modifications to implementing regulations governing section 1332 waivers, including\
  \ changes to many of the policies and interpretations of the statutory guardrails\
  \ codified in part 1 of the 2022 Payment Notice final rule. The final rule also\
  \ repealed and replaced the previous codification of the 2018 guidance’s guardrail\
  \ interpretations in part 1 of the 2022 Payment Notice final rule. The interpretations\
  \ of the statutory guardrails finalized as part of this final rule are largely in\
  \ line with the guardrail interpretations in the 2015 Guidance. With respect to\
  \ the statutory guardrails, the Departments finalized that they will interpret the\
  \ words “provide” and “coverage” to mean the same thing for the coverage, comprehensiveness,\
  \ and affordability guardrails, and that, to be approved, a waiver must be projected\
  \ to provide coverage that is as comprehensive and affordable as would have been\
  \ provided absent the waiver and to the same number of residents. Waivers must also\
  \ continue not to increase the federal deficit. The Departments modified regulations\
  \ in order to provide flexibilities in the public notice requirements and post-award\
  \ public participation requirements for section 1332 waivers under future emergent\
  \ circumstances, if certain criteria are met. The final rule also provided new information\
  \ regarding the processes and procedures for amendments and extensions of approved\
  \ section 1332 waivers.\n\nOn April 15, 2024, the Departments published the final\
  \ rule “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment\
  \ Parameters for 2025; Updating Section 1332 Waiver Public Notice Procedures; Medicaid;\
  \ Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) Program; and Basic Health Program.”\
  \ This final rule updated state public notice and comment procedures to allow states\
  \ to hold public hearings and post-award forums in virtual, in-person, or hybrid\
  \ formats. States must still hold two distinct public hearings; however, under this\
  \ rule one or both hearings may be conducted virtually or in a hybrid format. The\
  \ Departments offered this flexibility to states due to increased access to virtual\
  \ meeting technology, improved geographic accessibility, and lessons learned during\
  \ the public health emergency."
