objective: Under Section 1332 of the ACA, states can apply for State Innovation Waivers
  (also referred to as section 1332 waivers) and pursue innovative strategies to adapt
  many of the law's requirements to suit the state's specific needs. To receive approval,
  the state must demonstrate that a proposed section 1332 waiver meets the statutory
  guardrails to provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the coverage
  provided without the waiver; provides coverage and cost-sharing protections against
  excessive out-of-pocket spending that are at least as affordable as without the
  waiver; provides coverage to at least a comparable number of residents as without
  the waiver; and does not increase the federal deficit. Before submitting its section
  1332 waiver application the state must also provide a public notice and comment
  period, including public hearings, sufficient to ensure a meaningful level of public
  input, and enact a law providing for implementation of the waiver. Under a section
  1332 waiver, a state may receive pass-through funding associated with the resulting
  reductions in federal spending on Exchange financial assistance consistent with
  the statute.

rules_regulations: 'Regulations governing the application process for State Innovation
  Waivers can be found at the Federal Register at 77 Fed. Reg. 11700 (Feb. 27, 2012).
  Among other things, these regulations provide guidance on how to apply for a waiver
  and what an application from a state must contain, including actuarial and economic
  analyses. The regulations detail public notice and comment requirements that a state
  must comply with before an application is submitted, including holding public hearings,
  in order to facilitate a meaningful level of public involvement, input, and transparency
  in the state application process. They also describe the Federal public notice and
  comment process that will occur after a completed application has been received.
  The regulations also describe the requirements for post-award reporting and the
  standards under which post-award monitoring will take place. On October 24, 2018,
  the Departments published guidance (83 FR 53575, 2018 Guidance) providing information
  about the requirements that must be met for the approval of section 1332 waivers,
  including the Secretaries'' application review procedures, the calculation of pass-through
  funding, certain analytical requirements, and operational considerations. The 2018
  Guidance replaces the guidance related to Section 1332 of the ACA that was previously
  published on December 16, 2015 (80 FR 78131). Additionally, in November 2018, CMS
  released the Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver Concepts: Discussion
  Paper. This paper includes four waiver concepts which are offered to spur innovative
  ideas that can be utilized by individual states to improve their health care markets.
  The four waiver concepts include: State-Specific Premium Assistance, Adjusted Plan
  Options, Account-Based Subsidies, and Risk Stabilization Strategies. We welcome
  the opportunity to work with states to take advantage of the new flexibilities provided
  in the guidance and to pursue section 1332 waivers incorporating these waiver concepts.
  On July 15, 2019, CMS also published an updated section 1332 waiver checklist to
  help states as they develop and complete the required elements of their applications,
  particularly, waiver applications for implementing high-risk pool/state-operated
  reinsurance programs. This updated checklist itemizes the elements required to be
  included in the waiver application, including specific information about the waiver
  concepts, and a citation to the relevant regulatory provisions. On November 6, 2020,
  the Departments published an interim final rule (85 FR 71142), which revises regulations
  to set forth flexibilities in the public notice requirements and post award public
  participation requirements for waivers under section 1332 during the COVID-19 PHE.
  On December 4, 2020 the Departments published the “Patient Protection and Affordable
  Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2022 and Pharmacy Benefit
  Manager Standards; Updates to State Innovation Waiver (Section 1332 Waiver) Implementing
  Regulations” proposed rule (85 FR 78572) to codify certain policies and interpretations
  of the 2018 Guidance. On January 19, 2021 the Departments published the “Patient
  Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters
  for 2022; Updates to State Innovation Waiver (Section 1332 Waiver) Implementing
  Regulations” final rule (86 FR 6138) which codified many of the policies and interpretations
  outlined in the 2018 Guidance into section 1332 regulations. On July 1, 2021 the
  Departments published the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Updating
  Payment Parameters, Section 1332 Waiver Implementing Regulations, and Improving
  Health Insurance Markets for 2022 and Beyond Proposed Rule” proposed rule (86 FR
  35156) which proposed modifications to the section 1332 waivers implementing regulations,
  including changes to many of the policies and interpretations of the guardrails
  recently codified in regulation. As outlined in the proposed rule, the policies
  and interpretations proposed in the rule, if finalized, would supersede and rescind
  those outlined in the October 2018 guidance and repeal the previous codification
  of the interpretations of statutory guidelines in part 1 of the 2022 Payment Notice
  final rule. The Departments also proposed to modify regulations to set forth flexibilities
  in the public notice requirements and post award public participation requirements
  for section 1332 waivers under certain emergent situations. The Departments also
  proposed processes and procedures for amendments and extensions for approved waiver
  plans. This proposed rule was finalized in September 2021 (86 FR 54323) and became
  effective on November 26, 2021.'
