objective: " 050 Objectives: \r\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s\
  \ (FMCSA) objective is to fund State programs designed to improve the overall quality\
  \ of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) data in accordance with the FMCSA State Safety\
  \ Data Quality (SSDQ) measures, specifically to increase the timeliness, efficiency,\
  \ accuracy and completeness of processes and systems related to the collection and\
  \ analysis of large truck and bus crash and inspection data. \r\n\r\nThe Safety\
  \ Data Improvement Program grant purpose has been incorporated into the FMCSA Motor\
  \ Carrier Safety Assistance formula grant program and the FMCSA High Priority grant\
  \ program due to changes in FMCSA’s authorization under the Fixing America’s Surface\
  \ Transportation Act (Pub. L. No. § 114-94, §§ 5101(a) and 5101(c) (2015), 49 U.S.C.\
  \ §§ 31102(a)-(k), 31104 (2016), as amended).  Awards are no longer being made under\
  \ this CFDA; however, pre-existing grants will remain active until project completion\
  \ and/or period of performance on the individual grant agreements expires.  For\
  \ more information on this change, visit FMCSA CFDA number 20.218.\r\n"
