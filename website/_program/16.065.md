objective: 'The Training to Improve Police-Based Responses to People with Mental Illness
  includes the Collaborative Crisis Response and Intervention Training (CRIT) Program
  for Law Enforcement, a discretionary grant designed to enhance law enforcement agencies''
  capabilities in managing crisis situations involving individuals with mental health
  challenges. This program provides critical funding to support the development of
  specialized training initiatives that empower officers to effectively engage with
  individuals experiencing mental health crises or substance use disorders. The grant
  enables law enforcement agencies to implement best practices in crisis intervention,
  de-escalation techniques, and collaboration with mental health professionals and
  community organizations. By fostering the establishment of crisis intervention teams
  and integrating mental health strategies into law enforcement practices, the program
  aims to improve public safety outcomes and ensure that officers are equipped to
  handle crisis situations with compassion and effectiveness.


  The goal of the Collaborative Response and Intervention Training (CRIT) program
  aims to enhance law enforcement''s ability to effectively respond to individuals
  in crisis, particularly those experiencing mental health challenges, disabilities,
  or substance use disorders. By developing best-practice training programs and fostering
  collaboration between law enforcement and community service providers, CRIT seeks
  to promote safer interactions and improve overall outcomes for individuals in crisis.
  Ultimately, the program aspires to create a more informed and compassionate approach
  within law enforcement agencies, ensuring that officers are equipped to handle complex
  situations with empathy and professionalism.


  The objectives of the training program include the development and implementation
  of evidence-based training using the Bureau of Justice Assistance’s (BJA) CRIT Curriculum.
  This involves equipping officers with effective de-escalation techniques and fostering
  collaboration with community service providers to create comprehensive crisis response
  strategies. Additionally, the program emphasizes the importance of evaluating training
  effectiveness to assess its impact on law enforcement responses. By encouraging
  the integration of crisis response training into standard practices, CRIT aims to
  establish sustainable improvements in how law enforcement interacts with individuals
  in crisis.
