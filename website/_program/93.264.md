objective: The Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP) seeks to increase the number of qualified
  nursing faculty nationwide by providing low interest loans for individuals studying
  to be nurse faculty and loan cancelation for those who then go on to work as faculty.
  A robust, geographically dispersed nurse faculty workforce is essential to producing
  the nursing workforce needed to meet US health care needs. Successful applicants
  establish and operate a student loan program including maintaining a fund, providing
  loans to students enrolled in advanced education nursing degree programs, and monitoring
  compliance with program requirements. In exchange for completion of up to four years
  of post-graduation full-time nurse faculty employment in an accredited school of
  nursing, graduates receive cancellation of up to 85 percent of the original student
  loan amount (plus interest thereon) as authorized by the program. NFLP also encourages
  Advance Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) to serve as full-time preceptors within
  an academic-practice partnership framework in an effort to expand clinical training
  opportunities for nursing students.

    from disadvantaged background and twenty two percent from rural background. By
    the end of the Academic Year, the program graduated 837 trainees, eighty seven
    percent of whom intended to teach nursing. One year after graduation, sixty five
    percent of prior year graduates were teaching in faculty appointments. The NFLP
