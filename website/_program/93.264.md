objective: The Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP) seeks to increase the number of qualified
  nursing faculty nationwide by providing low interest loans for individuals studying
  to be nurse faculty and loan cancelation for those who then go on to work as faculty.
  A robust, geographically dispersed nurse faculty workforce is essential to producing
  the nursing workforce needed to meet US health care needs. Successful applicants
  establish and operate a student loan program including maintaining a fund, providing
  loans to students enrolled in advanced education nursing degree programs, and monitoring
  compliance with program requirements. In exchange for completion of up to four years
  of post-graduation full-time nurse faculty employment in an accredited school of
  nursing, graduates receive cancellation of up to 85 percent of the original student
  loan amount (plus interest thereon) as authorized by the program. NFLP also encourages
  Advance Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) to serve as full-time preceptors within
  an academic-practice partnership framework in an effort to expand clinical training
  opportunities for nursing students.

results:
- description: In Academic Year 2017-2018, 80 schools received new NFLP awards. Awardees
    supported 2,172 nursing students pursuing graduate level degrees as nurse faculty.
    This outcome is slightly below the FY 2017 target of 2,200 students, primarily
    as a result of an increased focus on training doctoral students who are not as
    vast in number as masterâ€™s students. In addition, with increasing tuition costs
    across schools, fewer individual awards are being made. The majority of students
    (84 percent) who received loans during the academic year were pursuing doctoral-level
    nursing degrees (e.g., PhD, DNP, DNSc/DNS, or EdD). By the end of the Academic
    Year, 800 trainees graduated, 94 percent of whom intended to teach nursing
