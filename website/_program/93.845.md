objective: The purpose of this program is to support the building of capacity in alcohol
  epidemiology in state and large city Health Departments and help provide the tools
  needed to perform core public health functions, such as public health surveillance.  This
  increased epidemiologic capacity will help build the public health infrastructure
  that is needed to address excessive alcohol use; the fourth leading preventable
  cause of death in the U.S.
