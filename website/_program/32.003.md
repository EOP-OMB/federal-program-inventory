objective: "Universal service has been defined by Congress as \u201Can evolving level\
  \ of telecommunications services . . . taking into account advances in telecommunications\
  \ and information technologies and services.\u201D 47 U.S.C. 254(c).  Universal\
  \ service support generally is distributed only to eligible telecommunications carriers\
  \ and must be used \u201Conly for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities\
  \ and services for which the support is intended.\u201D  47 U.S.C. 254(e).  In addition,\
  \ policies for the advancement and preservation of universal service must be based\
  \ on certain principles established by Congress.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(b).  Consistent\
  \ with these statutory provisions, the FCC has established the Universal Service\
  \ Fund, which disburses support for the provision of telecommunications services,\
  \ as well as other services and facilities (including broadband) for high-cost areas,\
  \ schools and libraries, rural health care providers, and low-income consumers."
