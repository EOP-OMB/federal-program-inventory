objective: 'The Food and Nutrition Service’s Food Safety Branch provides funding to
  support its mission of increasing awareness, visibility, and impact of food safety
  on USDA nutrition assistance programs. There are two active cooperative agreements
  funded.


  1. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) establishes
  cooperative agreements to conduct research to improve the safety of foods provided
  through the FNS nutrition assistance programs, particularly those served in schools
  and child care settings. These agreements provide an interdisciplinary and timely
  approach to applied food safety research needs related to FNS nutrition assistance
  programs, particularly the child nutrition programs, and develop written communications
  to convey research results to a variety of audiences, including scientists, policy
  makers, educators, and practitioners. (competitive)

  2. The Institute of Child Nutrition, an institute established by Congress to support
  Child Nutrition Programs, provides support to the FNS Food Safety Branch for developing
  food safety education programs and materials and conducting applied research related
  to food safety education. (non-competitive)'
