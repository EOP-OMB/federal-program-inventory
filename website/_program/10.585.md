  \ those served in schools and child care settings. These agreements provide an interdisciplinary\
  \ and timely approach to applied food safety research needs related to FNS nutrition\
  \ assistance programs, particularly the child nutrition programs, and develop written\
  \ communications to convey research results to a variety of audiences, including\
  \ scientists, policy makers, educators, and practitioners. (competitive)\n2. The\
