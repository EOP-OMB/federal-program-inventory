  \ safety on USDA nutrition assistance programs. There are two active cooperative\

  \ Service (FNS) establishes cooperative agreements to conduct research to improve\
  \ the safety of foods provided through the FNS nutrition assistance programs, particularly\
  \ those served in schools and child care settings. These agreements provide an interdisciplinary\
  \ and timely approach to applied food safety research needs related to FNS nutrition\
  \ assistance programs, particularly the child nutrition programs, and develop written\
  \ communications to convey research results to a variety of audiences, including\
  \ scientists, policy makers, educators, and practitioners. (competitive)\n2. The\
  \ Institute of Child Nutrition, an institute established by Congress to support\
  \ Child Nutrition Programs, provides support to the FNS Food Safety Branch for developing\
