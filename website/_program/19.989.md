objective: This CFDA number will be for projects and programs funded through the Africa
  Bureau's annual regional Economic Support Funds (ESF) allocations, but that are
  not part of a dedicated and repeating iterative set of funds. Meaning, for those
  programs that may appear under AF Regional ESF one year, but not be funded at all
  the next year -- for which there is no guarantee that it will it be funded from
  one year to the next.  This could apply to environmental programming, educational
  or health programming, countering Chinese influence projects, or specific ear-marks
  or policy mandates among others.
