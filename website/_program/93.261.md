objective: "The purpose of this Assistance Listing (AL) is to scale (expand) and sustain\
  \ the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP).  Scaling and sustaining\
  \ the National DPP includes: •\tEstablish an evidence-based lifestyle change program\
  \ in multiple states for populations at high risk for type 2 diabetes that meet\
  \ the standards outlined in  the CDC Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program Standards\
  \ and Operating Procedures (DPRP Standards) available at  www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/recognition;\
  \ • Recruit and facilitate training of lifestyle coaches to deliver the evidence-based\
  \ lifestyle change program;  Educate employers in multiple states about the benefits\
  \ and cost-savings of offering the evidence-based lifestyle change program as a\
  \ covered health benefit for employees; • Educate public and private health insurance\
  \ companies about the benefits and cost-savings of reimbursing organizations delivering\
  \ the evidence-based lifestyle change program using a pay-for-performance model;\
  \ • Develop and implement strategic marketing and promotional activities to increase\
  \ awareness and referrals to the evidence-based lifestyle change program; • Sustain\
  \ the evidence-based lifestyle change program without government grant funds when\
  \ this cooperative agreement ends, through securing voluntary reimbursement from\
  \ public and private health insurance companies for organizations delivering the\
  \ evidence-based lifestyle change program using a pay-for-performance model; \n\
  • Ensure that each intervention site offering the evidence-based lifestyle change\
  \ program under this AL will obtain recognition from the CDC DPRP.  • Ensure that\
  \ each intervention site offering the evidence-based lifestyle change program has\
  \ the capacity to collect participant information and maintain a data collection\
  \ system as outlined in the CDC DPRP."
