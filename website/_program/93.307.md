objective: "To support basic, clinical, social, and behavioral research; promote research\
  \ infrastructure and training; foster emerging programs; disseminate information;\
  \ and reach out to minority and other health disparity communities. The National\
  \ Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) has established programs\
  \ to pursue these goals: (1) The Centers of Excellence Program promotes research\
  \ to improve minority health and/or reduce and eliminate health disparities; builds\
  \ research capacity for minority health and health disparities research in academic\
  \ institutions; encourages participation of health disparity groups and communities\
  \ in biomedical and behavioral research and prevention and intervention activities;\
  \ and brings together investigators from relevant disciplines in a manner that will\
  \ enhance and extend the effectiveness of their research; (2) NIMHD Research Endowment\
  \ Program builds research capacity and infrastructure at eligible NIMHD Centers\
  \ of Excellence or eligible Section 736 health professions schools (42 U.S.C. 293)\
  \ to facilitate minority health and other health disparities research to close the\
  \ disparity gap in the burden of illness and death experienced by racial and ethnic\
  \ minority Americans and other health disparity populations; promotes a diverse\
  \ and strong scientific, technological and engineering workforce; and emphasizes\
  \ the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities and other socio-economically\
  \ disadvantaged populations in the fields of biomedical and behavioral research\
  \ and other areas of the scientific workforce; (3) The Centers of Excellence on\
  \ Environmental Health Disparities Research to stimulate basic and applied research\
  \ on environmental health disparities; (4) Minority Health and Health Disparities\
  \ International Research Training Program (MHIRT) awards enable U.S. institutions\
  \ to tailor short-term basic science, biomedical and behavioral mentored student\
  \ international research training opportunities to address global issues related\
  \ to understanding, reducing, and eliminating health disparities; (5) Small Business\
  \ Innovation Research (SBIR) Program increases private sector commercialization\
  \ of innovations derived from Federal research and development; encourages small\
  \ business participation in Federal research and development; and fosters and encourages\
  \ participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns\
  \ and women-owned small business concerns in technological innovation; (6) Small\
  \ Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program stimulates and fosters scientific\
  \ and technological innovation through cooperative research development carried\
  \ out between small business concerns and research institutions; fosters technology\
  \ transfer between small business concerns and research institutions; increases\
  \ private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research\
  \ and development; and fosters and encourages participation of socially and economically\
  \ disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small business concerns\
  \ in technological innovation; (7) Health Disparities Research Project Grants (RPG)\
  \ support innovative projects to enhance our understanding of biological mechanisms,\
  \ social, behavioral, and health services that can directly and demonstrably contribute\
  \ to the improvement in minority health and the elimination of health disparities\
  \ which includes the (8) Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) build\
  \ capacity for basic biomedical and/or behavioral research, clinical and translational\
  \ research (RCTR) and a network (RCTN) by focusing on institutional resource development,\
  \ such as supporting core research facilities and staff, purchasing advanced instrumentation,\
  \ and laboratory renovations/alterations (9) Clinical Research Education and Career\
  \ Development (CRECD) Awards provide didactic training and mentored clinical research\
  \ experiences to develop independent researchers who can lead clinical research\
  \ studies, especially those addressing health disparities; (10) Pathway to Independence\
  \ Awards (K99/R00) to increase and maintain a strong cohort of new and talented,\
  \ NIH-supported, independent investigators. (11) NIH Research Conference Grant and\
  \ NIH Research Conference Cooperative Agreement Programs support high-quality conferences\
  \ that are relevant to the minority health and health disparities; (12) Transdisciplinary\
  \ Collaborative Centers for Health Disparities Research comprise regional coalitions\
  \ of academic institutions, community organizations, service providers and systems,\
  \ government agencies and other stakeholders conducting coordinated research, implementation\
  \ and dissemination activities that transcend customary approaches and \u201Csilo\u201D\
  \ organizational structures to address critical questions at multiple levels in\
  \ innovative ways focused on priority research areas in minority health and health\
  \ disparities; (13) Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Individual Predoctoral Fellowshi\n\
