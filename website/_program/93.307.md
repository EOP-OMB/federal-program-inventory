objective: 'To support basic, clinical, social, and behavioral research; promote research
  infrastructure and training; foster emerging programs; disseminate information;
  and reach out to minority and other health disparity communities. The National Institute
  on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) has established programs to pursue
  these goals: (1) The Centers of Excellence Program promotes research to improve
  minority health and/or reduce and eliminate health disparities; builds research
  capacity for minority health and health disparities research in academic institutions;
  encourages participation of health disparity groups and communities in biomedical
  and behavioral research and prevention and intervention activities; and brings together
  investigators from relevant disciplines in a manner that will enhance and extend
  the effectiveness of their research; (2) NIMHD Research Endowment Program builds
  research capacity and infrastructure at eligible NIMHD Centers of Excellence or
  eligible Section 736 health professions schools (42 U.S.C. 293) to facilitate minority
  health and other health disparities research to close the disparity gap in the burden
  of illness and death experienced by racial and ethnic minority Americans and other
  health disparity populations; promotes a diverse and strong scientific, technological
  and engineering workforce; and emphasizes the recruitment and retention of underrepresented
  minorities and other socio-economically disadvantaged populations in the fields
  of biomedical and behavioral research and other areas of the scientific workforce;
  (3) The Centers of Excellence on Environmental Health Disparities Research to stimulate
  basic and applied research on environmental health disparities; (4) Minority Health
  and Health Disparities International Research Training Program (MHIRT) awards enable
  U.S. institutions to tailor short-term basic science, biomedical and behavioral
  mentored student international research training opportunities to address global
  issues related to understanding, reducing, and eliminating health disparities; (5)
  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program increases private sector commercialization
  of innovations derived from Federal research and development; encourages small business
  participation in Federal research and development; and fosters and encourages participation
  of socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation; (6) Small Business Technology
  Transfer (STTR) Program stimulates and fosters scientific and technological innovation
  through cooperative research development carried out between small business concerns
  and research institutions; fosters technology transfer between small business concerns
  and research institutions; increases private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; and fosters and encourages participation
  of socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation; (7) Health Disparities Research
  Project Grants (RPG) support innovative projects to enhance our understanding of
  biological mechanisms, social, behavioral, and health services that can directly
  and demonstrably contribute to the improvement in minority health and the elimination
  of health disparities which includes the (8) Research Centers in Minority Institutions
  (RCMI) build capacity for basic biomedical and/or behavioral research, clinical
  and translational research (RCTR) and a network (RCTN) by focusing on institutional
  resource development, such as supporting core research facilities and staff, purchasing
  advanced instrumentation, and laboratory renovations/alterations (9) Clinical Research
  Education and Career Development (CRECD) Awards provide didactic training and mentored
  clinical research experiences to develop independent researchers who can lead clinical
  research studies, especially those addressing health disparities; (10) Pathway to
  Independence Awards (K99/R00) to increase and maintain a strong cohort of new and
  talented, NIH-supported, independent investigators. (11) NIH Research Conference
  Grant and NIH Research Conference Cooperative Agreement Programs support high-quality
  conferences that are relevant to the minority health and health disparities; (12)
  Transdisciplinary Collaborative Centers for Health Disparities Research comprise
  regional coalitions of academic institutions, community organizations, service providers
  and systems, government agencies and other stakeholders conducting coordinated research,
  implementation and dissemination activities that transcend customary approaches
  and “silo” organizational structures to address critical questions at multiple levels
  in innovative ways focused on priority research areas in minority health and health
  disparities; (13) Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Individual Predoctoral Fellowshi
