objective: 'The objectives of the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) are to provide
  assistance to states and local communities, working through a network of community
  action agencies (CAAs) and other neighborhood-based organizations, for the reduction
  of poverty, the revitalization of low-income communities, and the empowerment of
  low-income families and individuals in rural and urban areas to become fully self-sufficient
  (particularly families who are attempting to transition off a State program carried
  out under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act) and (1) to provide services
  and activities having a measurable and potential major impact on causes of poverty
  in the community or those areas of the community where poverty is a particularly
  acute problem; (2) to provide activities designed to assist low-income participants,
  including the elderly poor, to: (a) secure and retain meaningful employment; (b)
  attain an adequate education; (c) make better use of available income; (d) obtain
  and maintain adequate housing and a suitable living environment; (e) obtain emergency
  assistance through loans or grants to meet immediate and urgent individual and family
  needs, including health services, nutritious food, housing, and employment-related
  assistance; (f) remove obstacles and solve problems which block the achievement
  of self-sufficiency; (g) achieve greater participation in the affairs of the community;
  and (h) make more effective use of other related programs; (3) to provide on an
  emergency basis for the provision of such supplies and services, nutritious food,
  and related services, as may be necessary to counteract conditions of starvation
  and malnutrition among the poor; and (4) to coordinate and establish linkages between
  governmental and other social services programs to assure the effective delivery
  of such services to low-income individuals. In addition to the CSBG funding to states,
  the Office of Community Services (OCS) funds additional discretionary projects for
  training and technical (T/TA) assistance. All CSBG funding opportunities are posted
  on https://www.grants.gov/.'
