objective: 'The objectives of the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) are to provide
  assistance to states and local communities, working through a network of community
  action agencies (CAAs) and other neighborhood-based organizations, for the reduction
  of poverty, the revitalization of low-income communities, and the empowerment of
  low-income families and individuals in rural and urban areas to become fully self-sufficient
  (particularly families who are attempting to transition off a State program carried
  out under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act) and (1) to provide services
  and activities having a measurable and potential major impact on causes of poverty
  in the community or those areas of the community where poverty is a particularly
  acute problem; (2) to provide activities designed to assist low-income participants,
  including the elderly poor, to: (a) secure and retain meaningful employment; (b)
  attain an adequate education; (c) make better use of available income; (d) obtain
  and maintain adequate housing and a suitable living environment; (e) obtain emergency
  assistance through loans or grants to meet immediate and urgent individual and family
  needs, including health services, nutritious food, housing, and employment-related
  assistance; (f) remove obstacles and solve problems which block the achievement
  of self-sufficiency; (g) achieve greater participation in the affairs of the community;
  and (h) make more effective use of other related programs; (3) to provide on an
  emergency basis for the provision of such supplies and services, nutritious food,
  and related services, as may be necessary to counteract conditions of starvation
  and malnutrition among the poor; and (4) to coordinate and establish linkages between
  governmental and other social services programs to assure the effective delivery
  of such services to low-income individuals. In addition to the CSBG funding to states,
  the Office of Community Services (OCS) funds additional discretionary projects for
  training and technical (T/TA) assistance. All CSBG funding opportunities are posted
  on https://www.grants.gov/.'

- description: In Fiscal Year 2024, CSBG issued 137 awards for anti-poverty programming.  Although
    no new awards were issued during the fiscal year, the federal office and it’s
    grant recipients made significant progress by building upon the foundational work
    established in previous years. With an ongoing emphasis on Training and Technical
    Assistance, initiatives and programs launched through prior awards documented
    innovative, capacity building strategies and approaches to service delivery in
    low-income communities. The Collaborative on Economic Mobility completed its research
    phase and advanced the planning for piloting promising practices to enhance economic
    mobility in disadvantaged communities, highlighting emerging strategies that strengthen
    pathways out of poverty. The Legal Training and Technical Assistance award  continued
    to identify, develop, and disseminate high-quality legal and technical assistance
    resources. These resources provided essential support to CSBG entities as they
    navigated legal and compliance challenges. The Performance Management T/TA award
    delivered ongoing technical assistance aimed at improving the quality, validity,
    and equity of CSBG data. This work is crucial in ensuring that the CSBG network
    remains responsive and accountable, with enhanced data-driven insights into program
    performance and outcomes. Under the Regional Performance and Innovation Consortium
    (RPIC) Capacity Building and Quality Improvement (CBQI) Initiative, 11 three-year
    cooperative agreements awarded in FY 2023 continued to drive capacity-building
    efforts. Regional leads spearheaded innovative T/TA strategies tailored to the
    unique needs of their regions, fostering greater quality improvement in service
    delivery.  Of note, each T/TA award  has an emphasis on embedding equity as a
    central focus with intentionality on bolstering CSBG’s work with tribal communities.
