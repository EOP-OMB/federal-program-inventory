objective: 'MARAD will use the projects results and data for a variety of purposes
  including to further the current efforts that address the curtailment of aquatic
  invasive species within the Chesapeake Bay and coastal waters throughout the United
  States as associated with ballast water operations of commercial shipping. '

- description: 'The three facilities are continuing their work with conducting verification
    and certification testing of ballast water management systems.  Also, collaborating
    with the USCG and RDC for verification of variable fluorescent fluorometers for
    ballast water compliance monitoring.  The goal of the project is to determine
    what portable tools can be used by inspectors when conducting a compliance inspection.
    A specific  aquatic species of concern is not an issue as the focus is on the
    USCG ballast water numerical standard.  The geographical area is not specific;
    in this case the effort will be conducted in brackish and other water determined
    by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and the Naval Research
    Lab.  Work also continues on hull husbandry research; bio-fouling of ships’ hulls
    is another source of non-indigenous species entry into the ecosystem.  The facilities
    are also conducting shipboard ballast water technology certification tests. The

  year: '2016'
- description: Verifying ballast water monitoring tools, testing ballast water management
    systems, surveying hull bio-fouling, recommending changes to USCG testing protocols
    vis-à-vis un-hatched eggs and phytoplankton characteristics.
  year: '2017'
- description: Developed a methodology for evaluating the efficiency of technologies
    to remove and capture "heavier" bio-fouling from ships' hulls.
  year: '2019'
- description: one ballast water treatment system, award of a sub-contract for a shipboard
    installation of a ballast water treatment system for real-time testing over a
    variety of challenge conditions, development of test plans for risk-based mesocosm
    tests of Great Lakes water, development of a data base that contains water conditions
    at selected Great Lakes Ports
  year: '2022'
- description: 'Finalized and released Guidelines for Testing Ship Biofouling In-Water
    Cleaning Systems

    Completed the first diver biofouling surveys on the M/V Cape Wrath (in Baltimore,
    MD) for the Armbach/Greensea fully-autonomous, proactive in-water cleaning system

    Completed a year of monthly sampling of water at the Dundalk Ro/Ro Terminal (Baltimore,
    MD) to understand the variability in levels of antifouling coating metal (e.g.,
    copper and zinc), microplastics, and basic water quality parameters (e.g., total
    suspended solids, particle size distributions) in port waters as a result of commercial
    ship activities. Data is now being assembled and analyzed.

    Published 3 peer-reviewed papers related to marine biofouling/bio-security

    Completed an ISO standard on test protocols for independent evaluations of ballast
    water compliance monitoring devices; preparing to trial the completed standard
    protocols.

    Initiated the effort to develop ISO guidelines for testing ship biofouling in-water
    cleaning systems'
