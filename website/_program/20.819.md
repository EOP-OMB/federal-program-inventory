objective: 'MARAD will use the projects results and data for a variety of purposes
  including to further the current efforts that address the curtailment of aquatic
  invasive species within the Chesapeake Bay and coastal waters throughout the United
  States as associated with ballast water operations of commercial shipping. '

results:
- description: one ballast water treatment system, award of a sub-contract for a shipboard
    installation of a ballast water treatment system for real-time testing over a
    variety of challenge conditions, development of test plans for risk-based mesocosm
    tests of Great Lakes water, development of a data base that contains water conditions
    at selected Great Lakes Ports
  year: '2022'
- description: 'Finalized and released Guidelines for Testing Ship Biofouling In-Water
    Cleaning Systems

    Completed the first diver biofouling surveys on the M/V Cape Wrath (in Baltimore,
    MD) for the Armbach/Greensea fully-autonomous, proactive in-water cleaning system

    Completed a year of monthly sampling of water at the Dundalk Ro/Ro Terminal (Baltimore,
    MD) to understand the variability in levels of antifouling coating metal (e.g.,
    copper and zinc), microplastics, and basic water quality parameters (e.g., total
    suspended solids, particle size distributions) in port waters as a result of commercial
    ship activities. Data is now being assembled and analyzed.

    Published 3 peer-reviewed papers related to marine biofouling/bio-security

    Completed an ISO standard on test protocols for independent evaluations of ballast
    water compliance monitoring devices; preparing to trial the completed standard
    protocols.

    Initiated the effort to develop ISO guidelines for testing ship biofouling in-water
    cleaning systems'
