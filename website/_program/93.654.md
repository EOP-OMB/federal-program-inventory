objective: "The Indian Health Service Behavioral Health Programs consists of several\
  \ funding programs designed to help Tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian\
  \ Organizations (UIO) assist American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations\
  \ achieve and realize the highest possible level of physical, mental, social and\
  \ spiritual health through addressing health concerns and delivery systems with\
  \ behavioral components.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention (SASP) Program\u2019\
  s objectives are to reduce the prevalence of suicide and substance use and decrease\
  \ the overall use of addicting and illicit substances among AI/AN populations, by\
  \ improving care coordination; expanding behavioral health care services through\
  \ the use of culturally appropriate evidence-based and practice-based models to\
  \ address these issues; develop or expand on activities for the Generation Indigenous\
  \ Initiative (Gen-I) by implementing early intervention strategies for AI/AN youth\
  \ at risk for suicidal behavior.\n\nThe objective of the Behavioral Health Integration\
  \ Initiative (BH2I) program is to improve the physical and mental health status\
  \ of people with behavioral health issues by developing an integrative, coordinated\
  \ system of care.  Awardees of this program will increase capacity among Tribal\
  \ and Urban Indian organization (UIO) health facilities to implement an integrative\
  \ approach in the delivery of behavioral health services, including trauma-informed\
  \ care, nutrition, exercise, social, spiritual, cultural, and primary care services\
  \ to improve morbidity and mortality outcomes among the AI/AN population.  In addition,\
  \ this effort will support activities that address improving the quality of life\
  \ for individuals suffering from mental illness, substance use disorders, and adverse\
  \ childhood experiences.\n\nThe objective of the Community Overdose Intervention\
  \ Prevention Program is to address the opioid crisis in AI/AN communities by the\
  \ following three things: first, developing and expanding community education and\
  \ awareness of prevention, treatment and recovery activities for opioid misuse and\
  \ opioid use disorder; second, increase knowledge and use of culturally appropriate\
  \ interventions and to encourage an increased use of medication-assisted treatment/medications\
  \ for opioid use disorder (MAT/MOUD); and third, support Tribal and Urban Indian\
  \ communities in their effort to provide prevention, treatment, and recovery services\
  \ to address the impact of the opioid crisis within their communities.\n\nThe objective\
  \ of the Preventing Alcohol-Related Deaths (PARD) through Social Detoxification\
  \ Program is to increase access to community-based prevention strategies to provide\
  \ social detoxification, evaluation, stabilization, fostering patient readiness\
  \ for and entry into treatment for alcohol use disorders and when appropriate, other\
  \ substance use disorders.\n\nThe objective of the Zero Suicide Initiative (ZSI)\
  \ is a key concept of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (NSSP) and is\
  \ a priority of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention.  The \u2018\
  Zero Suicide\u2019 model focuses on developing a system-wide approach to improving\
  \ care for individuals at risk of suicide who are currently utilizing health and\
  \ behavioral health systems.\n\nThe objective of the Youth Regional Treatment Center\
  \ (YRTC) Aftercare Program is to address gaps in services that occur when youth\
  \ transition from an YRTC treatment program and return home or to their designated\
  \ caregiver.  There may be limited, if any, aftercare support services available\
  \ in a youth\u2019s home community. Limited access to an aftercare support system\
  \ significantly decreases the likelihood of successful recovery and increases the\
  \ probability of relapse and other poor outcomes.\n\nThe objective of the NUIBH\
  \ program is to increase the awareness, visibility, advocacy, and education for\
  \ behavioral health issues on a national scare and in the interest of improving\
  \ Urban Indian health care."
