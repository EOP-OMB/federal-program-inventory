objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits or deductions for particular
  activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax
  uniformly all returns from investmentlike activities. In contrast, the Tax Code
  allows a tax credit per unit of electricity produced at a nuclear facility placed
  in service before enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The credit is based
  on the gross receipts of the facility, the electricity produced, any other Federal/State/local
  zero-emissions credits or grants received, and whether the facility adopts certain
  labor standards.
