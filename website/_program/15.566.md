objective: "To plan, implement, and administer programs to align water supplies and\
  \ demand for irrigation water users associated with the Klamath Project, with a\
  \ primary emphasis on programs developed or endorsed by local entities comprised\
  \ of representatives of those water users.  \n\nActivities are subject to appropriations\
  \ and required environmental reviews.  Expenditures may not exceed $10 million on\
  \ an average annual basis, and programs may not:\n(A) foster groundwater use that\
  \ results in groundwater level declines that, based on existing data from the United\
  \ States Geological Survey, are more than appropriate in a critically dry year,\
  \ taking into consideration the long-term sustainability of aquifers;\n(B) adversely\
  \ affect compliance with applicable laws protecting fishery resources in Upper Klamath\
  \ Lake and the Klamath River."

- description: N/A Formed an organizational working group to better estimate water
    supply and instrumentation measurement standardization during both drought and
    non-drought seasons; re-implement and update a 2006 groundwater model that provides
    accurate representation of basin subsurface water supplies; began studies to improve
    inflow forecasts into Upper Klamath Lake, estimate historical groundwater baseflow
    to streams, evapotranspiration, and snowpack estimating via satellite imagery.

- description: System improvement planning is under way at two Klamath Project irrigation
    districts.  In 2021, the Klamath Project Drought Response Agency distributed over
    $17.5 million to Klamath Project irrigators to reduce demand on drought-limited
    irrigation water supplies.
  year: '2021'
- description: Reclamation modified the FY21 cooperative agreement with the Klamath
    Project Drought Response Agency to continue drought response activities with $10
    million in additional funding, with $8 million more in process at the time of
    writing. Three additional cooperative agreements, with Horsefly Irrigation District,
    Langell Valley Irrigation District, and Farmers Conservation Alliance, totaling
    $5.3 million, are in progress.
  year: '2022'
- description: Reclamation continued funding the Klamath Project Drought Response
    Agency to continue drought response activities with approximately $7-$8 million
    in new funding.  Reclamation funded three agreements for system modernization
    and SCADA with Langell Valley Irrigation District, Horsefly Irrigation District,
    and Farmers Conservation Alliance, totalling $5.3 million.

- description: Projects undertaken have helped the Klamath Basin agricultural sector
    cope with persistent drought conditions by providing funding to support short-term
    demand reduction as well as planning for long-term modernization and efficiency
    projects sponsored by the Natural Resources Conservation Service PL566 program.
