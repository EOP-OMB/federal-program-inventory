objective: "To plan, implement, and administer programs to align water supplies and\
  \ demand for irrigation water users associated with the Klamath Project, with a\
  \ primary emphasis on programs developed or endorsed by local entities comprised\
  \ of representatives of those water users.  \n\nActivities are subject to appropriations\
  \ and required environmental reviews.  Expenditures may not exceed $10 million on\
  \ an average annual basis, and programs may not:\n(A) foster groundwater use that\
  \ results in groundwater level declines that, based on existing data from the United\
  \ States Geological Survey, are more than appropriate in a critically dry year,\
  \ taking into consideration the long-term sustainability of aquifers;\n(B) adversely\
  \ affect compliance with applicable laws protecting fishery resources in Upper Klamath\
  \ Lake and the Klamath River."
