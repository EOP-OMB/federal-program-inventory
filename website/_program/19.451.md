objective: To provide special grants for international exchanges and other activities
  that support and address current and emerging issues of mutual interest to the United
  States and other countries, consistent with the program criteria established in
  the Department’s annual appropriation. As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act,
  the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding
  between the people of the United States and the people of other countries by means
  of educational and cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars,
  researchers, professionals, students, and educators.  Educational and cultural engagement
  is premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future
  leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official
  decision-making almost everywhere in the world today.

- description: 'No Current Data Available. The Trust for University Innovation in
    Vietnam (TUIV) receives financial support from ECA, including funds via the U.S.
    Department of Treasury’s Vietnam Debt Repayment Fund, towards the development
    of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV), the first independent, not-for-profit university
    in Vietnam.  USAID also is providing funding.  FUV will embody American higher
    education values including academic freedom, autonomy, meritocracy, and transparency.  Based
    in Ho Chi Minh City, it will admit its first class of students in academic year
    2017-18 (teaching applied economics and management to Vietnamese mid-career managers
    and policymakers through a two-year Masters in Public Policy degree program) and
    its first undergraduates for 2018-19.  Ground will be broken on campus construction
    in the fall of 2017, with the first phase of the construction to be completed
    by 2020.  The Vietnamese government has been very supportive, including donating
    the land for the campus.  FUV builds on the investments made under the direction
    of the U.S. Congress over 20 years in the Fulbright Economic Teaching Program
    (FETP), a cornerstone of U.S.-Vietnamese bilateral cooperation in higher education
    for which ECA provided funding.  FETP has transitioned into FUV’s School of Public
    Policy and Management. '
