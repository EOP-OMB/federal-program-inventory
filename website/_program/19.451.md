objective: "To provide special grants for international exchanges and other activities\
  \ that support and address current and emerging issues of mutual interest to the\
  \ United States and other countries, consistent with the program criteria established\
  \ in the Department\u2019s annual appropriation. As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays\
  \ Act, the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual\
  \ understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other\
  \ countries by means of educational and cultural exchange programs, including the\
  \ exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals, students, and educators.  Educational\
  \ and cultural engagement is premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding,\
  \ the development of future leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence\
  \ societies and affect official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today."
