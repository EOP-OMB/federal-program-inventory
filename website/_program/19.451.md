  \ understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other\
  \ countries by means of educational and cultural exchange programs, including the\
  \ exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals, students, and educators.  Educational\
  \ and cultural engagement is premised on the knowledge that mutual understanding,\
  \ the development of future leaders, and the benefits of education programs influence\
  \ societies and affect official decision-making almost everywhere in the world today."
