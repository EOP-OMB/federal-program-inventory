objective: The program supports startup of new charter schools and the replication
  and expansion of high-quality charter schools.  Charter schools increase educational
  options for parents and students and, in exchange for stricter academic accountability,
  are exempt from many statutory and regulatory requirements.  Funds also support
  State efforts to improve charter schools' access to facilities.
