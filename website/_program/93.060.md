objective: "The purpose of this program is to promote sexual risk avoidance education\
  \ as defined by section 1110 of the Social Security Act, for adolescents. The focus\
  \ of the program is to teach participants how to voluntarily refrain from non-marital\
  \ sexual activity, and teach the benefits associated with self-regulation, success\
  \ sequencing for poverty prevention, healthy relationships, goal setting, resisting\
  \ sexual coercion, dating violence, and other youth risk behaviors such as underage\
  \ drinking or illicit drug use without normalizing teen sexual activity. Recipients\
  \ use an evidenced based approach and/or evidence-informed strategies to educate\
  \ youth on how to avoid risks that could lead to non-marital sexual activity. SRAE\
  \ projects are implemented using a Positive Youth Development (PYD) framework as\
  \ part of risk avoidance strategies, to help participants build healthy life skills,\
  \ develop individual protective factors that reduce risks, empower youth to make\
  \ healthy decisions, and provide tools and resources to prevent pregnancy and sexually\
  \ transmitted infections (STIs). Linking program participants to services provided\
  \ by local community partners that support the safety and well-being of youth is\
  \ also a key component to the program. The services are targeted to youth ages 10\
  \ to 19 and participants that reside in areas with high rates of teen births and/or\
  \ are at greatest risk of contracting STIs. The program\u2019s goals are to empower\
  \ participants to make healthy decisions, and provide tools and resources to prevent\
  \ pregnancy, STIs, and youth engagement in other risky behaviors. Recipients must\
  \ agree to use medically accurate information referenced to peer-reviewed publications\
  \ by educational, scientific, governmental, or health organizations and implement\
  \ an evidence-based approach integrating research findings with practical implementation\
  \ that aligns with the needs and desired outcomes for the intended audience."
