objective: The purpose of this program is to promote sexual risk avoidance education
  as defined by section 1110 of the Social Security Act, for adolescents. The focus
  of the program is to teach participants how to voluntarily refrain from non-marital
  sexual activity, and teach the benefits associated with self-regulation, success
  sequencing for poverty prevention, healthy relationships, goal setting, resisting
  sexual coercion, dating violence, and other youth risk behaviors such as underage
  drinking or illicit drug use without normalizing teen sexual activity. Recipients
  use an evidenced based approach and/or evidence-informed strategies to educate youth
  on how to avoid risks that could lead to non-marital sexual activity. SRAE projects
  are implemented using a Positive Youth Development (PYD) framework as part of risk
  avoidance strategies, to help participants build healthy life skills, develop individual
  protective factors that reduce risks, empower youth to make healthy decisions, and
  provide tools and resources to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections
  (STIs). Linking program participants to services provided by local community partners
  that support the safety and well-being of youth is also a key component to the program.
  The services are targeted to youth ages 10 to 19 and participants that reside in
  areas with high rates of teen births and/or are at greatest risk of contracting
  STIs. The programâ€™s goals are to empower participants to make healthy decisions,
  and provide tools and resources to prevent pregnancy, STIs, and youth engagement
  in other risky behaviors. Recipients must agree to use medically accurate information
  referenced to peer-reviewed publications by educational, scientific, governmental,
  or health organizations and implement an evidence-based approach integrating research
  findings with practical implementation that aligns with the needs and desired outcomes
  for the intended audience.
