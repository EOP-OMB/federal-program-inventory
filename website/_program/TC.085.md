objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all profits and income under
  the regular tax rate schedule. U.S. shipping companies may choose to be subject
  to a tonnage tax based on gross shipping weight in lieu of an income tax, in which
  case profits would not be subject to tax under the regular tax rate schedule.
