objective: The GPOI program enhances international capacity to effectively conduct
  UN and regional peace operations.  International peace operations are strategically
  important to U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives.  They represent
  a cost-effective tool for managing conflict, supporting stabilization in some of
  the world’s most volatile regions, and facilitating peacebuilding efforts, enabling
  the international community to share the burden of maintaining peace and security.  The
  GPOI program is the primary mechanism through which the United States contributes
  to strengthening global capacity to conduct peace operations.  The program’s partnerships
  emphasize institutional capacity-building relationships and seek to strengthen partner
  countries’ capabilities to self-sufficiently train, deploy, employ, and sustain
  peacekeeping forces.  GPOI activities train and mentor partners to develop critical
  enabling and rapid deployment capabilities that are greatly needed and consistently
  requested to fill critical gaps in peace operations; increase the operational capacity
  of the UN and regional organizations to field more effective peace operations; and
  seek to develop and reinforce peacekeepers’ capabilities and commitment to protect
  civilians and promote the role of women in peace operations.
