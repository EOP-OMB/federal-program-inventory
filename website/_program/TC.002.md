objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation received by U.S. citizens
  and residents is properly included in their taxable income. It makes no difference
  whether the compensation is a result of working abroad or whether it is labeled
  as a housing allowance. In contrast to this treatment, U.S. tax law allows U.S.
  citizens and residents who live abroad, work in the private sector, and satisfy
  a foreign residency requirement to exclude up to $80,000, plus adjustments for inflation
  since 2004, in foreign earned income from U.S. taxes. In addition, if these taxpayers
  are provided housing by their employers, then they may also exclude the cost of
  such housing from their income to the extent that it exceeds 16 percent of the earned
  income exclusion limit. This housing exclusion is capped at 30 percent of the earned
  income exclusion limit, with geographical adjustments. If taxpayers do not receive
  a specific allowance for housing expenses, they may deduct housing expenses up to
  the amount by which foreign earned income exceeds their foreign earned income exclusion.
