objective: "The mission of the Commission is to help build sustainable communities\
  \ and promote economic growth across the Southeast Crescent region, which encompasses\
  \ some of the highest poverty rates in the United States. The federal-state partnership\
  \ is comprised of the Federal Co-Chair and the seven Governors of the participating\
  \ States.  From  participating states, one Governor is elected as the States\u2019\
  \ Co-Chair.  The State Alternates\u2019 offices are the coordinators for the Governors\
  \ for SCRC investments. All activities funded by the SCRC must advance the Commission\u2019\
  s Five-Year Strategic Plan.  Responsibility for the development of plans and programs\
  \ authorized under the enabling statute is vested in the Commission. Also established\
  \ by the Commission are general policies and procedures and the allocation of funds\
  \ among the programs and states. \n\nSCRC activities and projects must align with\
  \ one or more of the six strategic goals identified in the SCRC five-year strategic\
  \ plan: (1) Invest in Critical Infrastructure; (2) Improve Health and Support Services\
  \ Access and Outcomes; (3) Strengthen Workforce Capacity; (4) Foster Entrepreneurial\
