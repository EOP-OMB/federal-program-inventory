objective: "The mission of the Commission is to help build sustainable communities\
  \ and promote economic growth across the Southeast Crescent region, which encompasses\
  \ some of the highest poverty rates in the United States. The federal-state partnership\
  \ is comprised of the Federal Co-Chair and the seven Governors of the participating\
  \ States.  From  participating states, one Governor is elected as the States’ Co-Chair.\
  \  The State Alternates’ offices are the coordinators for the Governors for SCRC\
  \ investments. All activities funded by the SCRC must advance the Commission’s Five-Year\
  \ Strategic Plan.  Responsibility for the development of plans and programs authorized\
  \ under the enabling statute is vested in the Commission. Also established by the\
  \ Commission are general policies and procedures and the allocation of funds among\
  \ the programs and states. \n\nSCRC activities and projects must align with one\
  \ or more of the six strategic goals identified in the SCRC five-year strategic\
  \ plan: (1) Invest in Critical Infrastructure; (2) Improve Health and Support Services\
  \ Access and Outcomes; (3) Strengthen Workforce Capacity; (4) Foster Entrepreneurial\
  \ and Business Development Activities; (5) Expand Affordable Housing Stock and Access;\
  \ and (6) Promote Environmental, Conservation, Preservation, and Access.  Additional\
  \ information regarding these goals and associated objectives can be found at scrc.gov."
