objective: 'The Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) allows the Secretary
  to provide funding opportunities to conduct and evaluate projects providing incentives
  to increase the purchase of fruits and vegetables by low-income consumers. By bringing
  together stakeholders from various parts of the food and healthcare systems, GusNIP
  grants help foster understanding to improve the health and nutrition status of participating
  households, facilitate growth in states with low participation, as well as collect
  and aggregate data to identify and improve best practices on a broad scale.

  OVERVIEW:

  The 2018 Farm Bill authorized the program for fiscal years 2019 through 2023 and
  growth in program funding from $45 million to $56 million to be appropriated over
  5 years. Across the GusNIP grant program there are three grant types and three project
  types available, which are described briefly below:

  GRANT TYPES:

  Nutrition Incentive – develop and evaluate projects to increase the purchase of
  fruits and vegetables by low-income consumers participating in the Supplemental
  Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by providing incentives at the point of purchase,

  Produce Prescription – conduct projects that demonstrate and evaluate the impact
  of financial or non-financial incentive prescriptions of fresh fruits and vegetables
  in addition to nutrition educational opportunities to increase procurement and consumption
  of fruits and vegetables, reduce individual and household food insecurity, and reduce
  healthcare usage and associated costs, and;

  Cooperative Agreement - offer training, technical assistance, evaluation, and informational
  support services to the nutrition incentive projects, produce prescription projects
  and to the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program as a whole.'
