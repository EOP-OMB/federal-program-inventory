objective: 'Additional COVID relief and response appropriations were made to GusNIP.


  GusNIP COVID Relief and Response (GusCRR) funding will generally be directed to
  address critical food security needs of low-income communities, enhancing the resilience
  of food and healthcare systems enduring the pandemic, and maximize funds reaching
  participants in communities in need. GusNIP awardees are particularly well positioned
  to respond with pandemic relief in an impactful and timely way. NIFA requests applications
  for expanded scope of work of active GusNIP and FINI awards. For eligibility purposes,
  the period of performance in your current active GusNIP or FINI award must have
  begun prior to December 27, 2020 and must have an end date at least 90 days after
  the publication date of this RFA. GusCRR does not replace current programming or
  current award activities.


  The purpose of the GusNIP program is to fund and evaluate projects intended to increase
  the purchase of fruits and vegetables by low-income consumers by providing incentives
  at the point of purchase and bring together stakeholders from various parts of the
  food and healthcare systems to foster understanding of how they might improve the
  health and nutrition status of participating households. The GusNIP program includes
  nutrition incentive grants, produce prescription grants and cooperative agreements.


  The primary goals and objectives for GusNIP nutrition incentive grants are to “increase
  the purchase of fruits and vegetables by low-income consumers participating in  Supplemental
  Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by providing incentives at the point of purchase”
  [7 U.S.C. 7517(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) as amended].


  For GusNIP, nutrition incentive grants, NIFA defines “fruits and vegetables” as
  “any variety of fresh, canned, dried, or frozen whole or cut fruits and vegetables
  without added sugars, fats, or oils, and salt (i.e., sodium).” GusNIP nutrition
  incentive grants will test strategies that could contribute to our understanding
  of how best to increase the purchase of fruits and vegetables by SNAP participants
  to inform future efforts.


  The primary goals and objectives for GusNIP produce prescription grants are to prescribe
  fresh fruits and vegetables in addition to educational opportunities relating to
  nutrition to members that demonstrate and evaluate the impact of produce prescriptions
  on (1) the improvement of dietary health through increased consumption of fruits
  and vegetables; (2) the reduction of individual and household food insecurity; and
  (3) the reduction in healthcare use and associated costs.

  The Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program [formerly known as the Food Insecurity
  Nutrition Incentive (FINI)] grant program is a competitive program. Projects funded
  under this program provide incentives to low-income consumers participating in the
  supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) to purchase fruits and vegetables
  at the point of sale. The projects supported by this program have the support of
  State agencies and include use of effective and efficient benefit redemption technologies
  that can serve as a replicable model for benefit redemption.'
