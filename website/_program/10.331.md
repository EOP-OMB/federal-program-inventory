objective: "Additional COVID relief and response appropriations were made to GusNIP.\n\
  \nGusNIP COVID Relief and Response (GusCRR) funding will generally be directed to\
  \ address critical food security needs of low-income communities, enhancing the\
  \ resilience of food and healthcare systems enduring the pandemic, and maximize\
  \ funds reaching participants in communities in need. GusNIP awardees are particularly\
  \ well positioned to respond with pandemic relief in an impactful and timely way.\
  \ NIFA requests applications for expanded scope of work of active GusNIP and FINI\
  \ awards. For eligibility purposes, the period of performance in your current active\
  \ GusNIP or FINI award must have begun prior to December 27, 2020 and must have\
  \ an end date at least 90 days after the publication date of this RFA. GusCRR does\
  \ not replace current programming or current award activities.\n\nThe purpose of\
  \ the GusNIP program is to fund and evaluate projects intended to increase the purchase\
  \ of fruits and vegetables by low-income consumers by providing incentives at the\
  \ point of purchase and bring together stakeholders from various parts of the food\
  \ and healthcare systems to foster understanding of how they might improve the health\
  \ and nutrition status of participating households. The GusNIP program includes\
  \ nutrition incentive grants, produce prescription grants and cooperative agreements.\n\
  \nThe primary goals and objectives for GusNIP nutrition incentive grants are to\
  \ \u201Cincrease the purchase of fruits and vegetables by low-income consumers participating\
  \ in  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by providing incentives at\
  \ the point of purchase\u201D [7 U.S.C. 7517(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) as amended].\n\nFor\
  \ GusNIP, nutrition incentive grants, NIFA defines \u201Cfruits and vegetables\u201D\
  \ as \u201Cany variety of fresh, canned, dried, or frozen whole or cut fruits and\
  \ vegetables without added sugars, fats, or oils, and salt (i.e., sodium).\u201D\
  \ GusNIP nutrition incentive grants will test strategies that could contribute to\
  \ our understanding of how best to increase the purchase of fruits and vegetables\
  \ by SNAP participants to inform future efforts.\n\nThe primary goals and objectives\
  \ for GusNIP produce prescription grants are to prescribe fresh fruits and vegetables\
  \ in addition to educational opportunities relating to nutrition to members that\
  \ demonstrate and evaluate the impact of produce prescriptions on (1) the improvement\
  \ of dietary health through increased consumption of fruits and vegetables; (2)\
  \ the reduction of individual and household food insecurity; and (3) the reduction\
  \ in healthcare use and associated costs.\nThe Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive\
  \ Program [formerly known as the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI)] grant\
  \ program is a competitive program. Projects funded under this program provide incentives\
  \ to low-income consumers participating in the supplemental nutrition assistance\
  \ program (SNAP) to purchase fruits and vegetables at the point of sale. The projects\
  \ supported by this program have the support of State agencies and include use of\
  \ effective and efficient benefit redemption technologies that can serve as a replicable\
  \ model for benefit redemption."
