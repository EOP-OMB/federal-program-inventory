objective: 'To support state (including territories that are included in the definition
  of state in the Solid Waste Disposal Act) and tribal corrective action programs
  that address releases from underground storage tanks (USTs).


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2024:  Cooperative agreements to states and tribes
  to support activities in making progress in cleaning up petroleum leaks by initiating
  and completing cleanups and reducing the backlog of sites not yet cleaned up. In
  FY 2024, at least 80 percent of LUST corrective action appropriated funds will be
  provided to states to carry out the LUST corrective action program. The priority
  in FY 2024 is to provide resources to states to perform core cleanup work, with
  a focus on cleaning up the highest priority sites.'

    Rico) and four territories and approximately 2 Indian Tribes will submit assistance
    agreement applications and will be awarded LUST corrective action assistance agreements.
    Final performance measure results are not available at this time.  In FY 2016,
    52 States (including DC and Puerto Rico) and four territories and 2 Indian Tribes
    submitted assistance agreement applications and were awarded LUST corrective action
