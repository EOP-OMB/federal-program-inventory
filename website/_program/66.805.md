  that address releases from underground storage tanks (USTs).


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2024:  Cooperative agreements to states and tribes
  to support activities in making progress in cleaning up petroleum leaks by initiating
  and completing cleanups and reducing the backlog of sites not yet cleaned up. In
  FY 2024, at least 80 percent of LUST corrective action appropriated funds will be
  provided to states to carry out the LUST corrective action program. The priority
  in FY 2024 is to provide resources to states to perform core cleanup work, with
  a focus on cleaning up the highest priority sites.'
