objective: 'To support state (including territories that are included in the definition
  of state in the Solid Waste Disposal Act) and tribal corrective action programs
  that address releases from underground storage tanks (USTs).


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023:  Cooperative agreements to states and tribes
  to support activities in making progress in cleaning up petroleum leaks by initiating
  and completing cleanups and reducing the backlog of sites not yet cleaned up. In
  FY 2023, at least 80 percent of LUST corrective action appropriated funds will be
  provided to states to carry out the LUST corrective action program. The priority
  in FY 2023 is to provide resources to states to perform core cleanup work, with
  a focus on cleaning up the highest priority sites.'
