objective: Under the baseline tax system, corporations pay taxes on their profits
  under the regular tax rate schedule. The baseline tax system would not allow preferentially
  low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Generally
  the income generated by life and property and casualty insurance companies is subject
  to tax, albeit under special rules. However, income from insurance operations conducted
  by certain tax-exempt organizations, such as fraternal societies, voluntary employee
  benefit associations, and others are exempt from tax.
