objective: The baseline tax system would require corporations to pay taxes on their
  profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low
  (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Under current
  law, however, stock non-life insurance companies are generally exempt from tax if
  their gross receipts for the taxable year do not exceed $600,000 and more than 50
  percent of such gross receipts consist of premiums. Mutual non-life insurance companies
  are generally tax-exempt if their annual gross receipts do not exceed $150,000 and
  more than 35 percent of gross receipts consist of premiums. Also, non-life insurance
  companies with no more than a specified level of annual net written premiums generally
  may elect to pay tax only on their taxable investment income provided certain ownership
  diversification requirements are met. The underwriting income (premiums, less insurance
  losses and expenses) of electing companies is excluded from tax. The specified premium
  limit is indexed for inflation; for 2024, the premium limit is $2.8 million.
