objective: "Telehealth has assumed a critical role in health care delivery as technology\
  \ and improved broadband connectivity have enabled patients to access health care\
  \ services without needing to visit a health care provider\u2019s physical location.\
  \ Advances in telehealth are transforming health care from a service delivered through\
  \ traditional brick and mortar health care facilities to connected care options\
  \ delivered via a broadband Internet access connection directly to the patient\u2019\
  s home or mobile location. Despite the numerous benefits of connected care services,\
  \ patients who cannot afford or who otherwise lack reliable, robust broadband Internet\
  \ access connectivity, including many low-income Americans and veterans, are not\
  \ realizing the benefits of these innovative telehealth technologies. The costs\
  \ necessary to provide connected care services may also limit some health care providers\u2019\
  \ ability to treat patients, particularly low-income Americans and veterans, with\
  \ connected care services. To address this, the Federal Communications Commission\
  \ (Commission) established the Connected Care Pilot Program (Pilot Program) within\
  \ the Universal Service Fund (USF or Fund) to provide funding up to $100 million\
  \ over three years and to examine how the Fund can help support the trend towards\
  \ connected care services, particularly for low-income Americans and veterans. The\
  \ Pilot Program was set up to help defray eligible health care providers\u2019 costs\
  \ of providing connected care services, with a particular emphasis on supporting\
  \ these services for eligible low-income Americans and veterans. The Commission\
  \ expects that the Pilot Program will benefit many low-income and veteran patients\
  \ who are responding to a wide variety of health challenges such as public health\
  \ epidemics, opioid dependency, mental health conditions, high-risk pregnancy, and\
  \ chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, and heart disease.\
  \ The Commission also expects that the Pilot Program will provide meaningful data\
  \ that will help better understand how USF funds can support health care provider\
  \ and patient use of connected care services, and how supporting health care provider\
  \ and patient use of connected care services can improve health outcomes and reduce\
  \ health care costs."
