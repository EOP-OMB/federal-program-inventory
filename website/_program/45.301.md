objective: "Museums for America (MFA) is designed to strengthen the ability of individual\
  \ museums to serve the public more effectively by supporting high-priority activities\
  \ that advance their missions, plans, and strategic goals and objectives. MFA has\
  \ three program goals—Lifelong Learning, Community Engagement, and Collections Stewardship\
  \ and Access—with three associated objectives each. \n\nMuseums Empowered: Professional\
  \ Development Opportunities for Museum Staff, a special initiative of the MFA grant\
  \ program, supports using the transformative power of professional development and\
  \ training to generate systemic change within museums of all types and sizes. It\
  \ has four program goals—Digital Technology; Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Evaluation;\
  \ and Organizational Management—with two associated objectives each. \n\nInspire!\
  \ Grants for Small Museums, a special initiative of the MFA program, supports small\
  \ museums of all disciplines in project-based efforts to serve the public through\
  \ exhibitions, educational/interpretive programs, digital learning resources, policy\
  \ development and institutional planning, technology enhancements, professional\
  \ development, community outreach, audience development, and/or collections management,\
  \ curation, care, and conservation. It has one program goal—to build the capacity\
  \ of small museums to provide museum services to their communities—with four associated\
  \ objectives.\n\nPlease see the Notice of Funding Opportunity for details of the\
  \ specific goals and objectives for these grant programs."
