objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest
  earned on small issue industrial development bonds (IDBs) issued by State and local
  governments to finance manufacturing facilities to be tax exempt. Depreciable property
  financed with small issue IDBs must be depreciated, however, using the straight-line
  method. The annual volume of small issue IDBs is subject to the unified volume cap
  discussed in the mortgage housing bond section above.
