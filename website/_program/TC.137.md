objective: The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures
  including charitable contributions. In contrast, the Tax Code provides individuals
  and corporations a deduction for contributions to nonprofit health institutions.
  Tax expenditures resulting from the deductibility of contributions to other charitable
  institutions are listed under the education, training, employment, and social services
  function.
