objective: To restore native fish and other aquatic species to self-sustaining levels
  by reconnecting habitat that barriers have fragmented, where such reconnection would
  not result in a net negative ecological effect such as providing increased habitat
  to aquatic nuisance species. Fish passage projects restore unimpeded flows and fish
  movement by removing barriers or providing ways for aquatic species to bypass them.
  The program works on a voluntary basis and provides financial support and technical
  assistance to Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies, as well as private partners
  and stakeholders.
