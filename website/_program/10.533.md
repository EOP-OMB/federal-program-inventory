results:
- description: In FY 2019, intervention developers submitted 74 nutrition education
    interventions for peer review.  50 of these interventions were determined to be
    evidence-based for use in SNAP-Ed by 64 researchers and practitioners in the fields
    of nutrition and public health.  Detailed descriptions of the 50 new nutrition
    interventions, including behavioral outcomes associated with each, were added
    to the SNAP-Ed Toolkit by the close of the fiscal year.
  year: '2019'
- description: In FY 2020, an additional 21 new interventions were added to the SNAP-Ed
    Toolkit.  There are now more than 150 evidence-based interventions available to
    State and implementing agencies.  Existing interventions were updated to include
    cost of materials, with additional updates made, as needed.  Additional training
    resources, such as a list of interventions that are evidence-based for use online,
    and an online resource list, were added to facilitate SNAP-Ed program's ability
    to operate while complying with distancing requirements to respond to the COVID-19
    pandemic.
  year: '2020'
- description: In FY2021, in addition website updates and maintenance, the SNAP-Ed
    Toolkit convened an expert working group to assess gaps and update selected SNAP-Ed
    Evaluation Framework indicators. The training resources section of the website
    was updated and enhances.
  year: '2021'
- description: In FY2022, in addition to website updates, operation and maintenance,
    the SNAP-Ed Toolkit (Toolkit) called for new evidence-based interventions to promote
    increases in public health approaches to address nutrition security, and alignment
    with the Thrifty Food Plan and the most current Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
    Thirteen new interventions and three new resources were selected and added to
    the collection of 147 evidence-based interventions, including curricula that celebrate
    diverse cultural traditions; policy, systems and environmental change strategies;
    and a social marketing campaign. The Toolkit team also developed a compendium
    of SNAP-Ed funded outcomes  included in peer-reviewed papers, as directed by the
    2018 Farm Bill, which required the creation of an online clearinghouse for best
    practices to assist SNAP-Ed providers with program planning, implementation and
    evaluation. Additionally, the Toolkit team conducted a series of equity-focused
    training webinars to address community engagement, staff recruitment, development
    and retention and community needs assessment through an equity lens.
  year: '2022'
- description: 'In FY 2023, in addition to website updates and maintenance, the UNC
    team added a new Literature Review database to the SNAP-Ed Toolkit website. This
    is a searchable database with peer-reviewed literature on outcome evaluation results
    from SNAP-Ed funded projects. The database includes categories, such as target
    behavior, setting, and outcome level, to enable a more focused list of published
    papers for review. Each paper included in the online database includes an Abstract
    and link. If the published paper includes an intervention in the SNAP-Ed Toolkit,
    a link to the intervention is also provided. The Toolkit team also worked to gather
    information about updates needed to the SNAP-Ed Evaluation Framework. This included
    feedback from internal and external SNAP-Ed partners.

    The Toolkit team worked to transition the SNAP-Ed Toolkit website and resources
    to the SNAP-Ed Connection website, allowing all resources to be available for
    SNAP-Ed partners on one website.'
