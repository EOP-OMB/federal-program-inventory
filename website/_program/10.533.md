results:
- description: In FY2022, in addition to website updates, operation and maintenance,
    the SNAP-Ed Toolkit (Toolkit) called for new evidence-based interventions to promote
    increases in public health approaches to address nutrition security, and alignment
    with the Thrifty Food Plan and the most current Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
    Thirteen new interventions and three new resources were selected and added to
    the collection of 147 evidence-based interventions, including curricula that celebrate
    diverse cultural traditions; policy, systems and environmental change strategies;
    and a social marketing campaign. The Toolkit team also developed a compendium
    of SNAP-Ed funded outcomes  included in peer-reviewed papers, as directed by the
    2018 Farm Bill, which required the creation of an online clearinghouse for best
    practices to assist SNAP-Ed providers with program planning, implementation and
    evaluation. Additionally, the Toolkit team conducted a series of equity-focused
    training webinars to address community engagement, staff recruitment, development
    and retention and community needs assessment through an equity lens.

- description: In FY 2023, in addition to website updates and maintenance, the UNC
    team added a new Literature Review database to the SNAP-Ed Toolkit website. This
    is a searchable database with peer-reviewed literature on outcome evaluation results
    from SNAP-Ed funded projects. The database includes categories, such as target
    behavior, setting, and outcome level, to enable a more focused list of published
    papers for review. Each paper included in the online database includes an Abstract
    and link. If the published paper includes an intervention in the SNAP-Ed Toolkit,
    a link to the intervention is also provided. The Toolkit team also worked to gather
    information about updates needed to the SNAP-Ed Evaluation Framework. This included
    feedback from internal and external SNAP-Ed partners.
