objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain
  types or sources of income. For individuals, tax rates on regular income vary from
  10 percent to 39.6 percent in the budget window (plus a 3.8 percent surtax on high
  income taxpayers), depending on the taxpayerâ€™s income. In contrast, under current
  law, qualified dividends are taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher
  than 20 percent (plus the 3.8 percent surtax).
