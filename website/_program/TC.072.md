objective: Under the baseline tax system, all income would generally be taxed under
  the regular tax rate schedule. The baseline tax system would not allow preferentially
  low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast,
  the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a taxpayerâ€™s taxable income for any discharge
  of qualified real property business indebtedness by taxpayers other than a C corporation.
  If the canceled debt is not reported as current income, however, the basis of the
  underlying property must be reduced by the amount canceled.
