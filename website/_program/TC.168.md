objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because they represent
  accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. Under current
  law, however, pension payments made by the Veterans Administration are excluded
  from gross income.
