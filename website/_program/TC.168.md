objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities
  or targeting specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code in 2009 allowed State and
  local governments to issue taxable bonds through 2010 and receive a direct payment
  from Treasury equal to 35 percent of interest expenses. Alternatively, State and
  local governments could issue taxable bonds and the private lenders would receive
  the 35 percent credit which is included in taxable income.
