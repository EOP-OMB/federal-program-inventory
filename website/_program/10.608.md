objective: "The key objective of the McGovern-Dole Program is to reduce hunger and\
  \ improve literacy and primary education, especially for girls. By providing school\
  \ meals, teacher training and related support, McGovern-Dole projects help boost\
  \ school enrollment and academic performance. At the same time, the program also\
  \ focuses on improving childrenâ€™s health and learning capacity before they enter\
  \ school by offering nutrition programs for pregnant and nursing women, infants\
  \ and pre-schoolers. \n\nSustainability is an important aspect of the McGovern-Dole\
  \ Program. FAS and its partner organizations work to ensure that the communities\
  \ served by the program can ultimately continue the sponsored activities on their\
  \ own or with support from other sources such as the host government or local community."
