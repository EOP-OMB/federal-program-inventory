objective: "The purpose of this cooperative agreement funding opportunity is to support\
  \ the implementation of the Integrated Care for Kids (INCK) model with up to eight\
  \ (8) awardees. \n\nThe InCK Model is a child-centered state payment and local service\
  \ delivery model aimed at reducing expenditures and improving the quality of care\
  \ for children up to age 21 covered by Medicaid and CHIP through early identification\
  \ and treatment of priority health concerns like behavioral health conditions, and\
  \ physical health needs. CMS will award InCK Model cooperative agreements to partnerships\
  \ between state Medicaid agencies (hereafter called the “state”) and local organizations\
  \ (hereafter called the “Lead Organization”) to leverage and build on existing child\
  \ programs. One or more state-driven alternative payment models (APMs) will support\
  \ these partnerships to improve the coordination and quality of care through accountability\
  \ for costs and outcomes.  Model Awardees will develop local care delivery approaches\
  \ and infrastructure to: \n•\tIdentify, assess, and risk stratify children with\
  \ or at-risk for significant behavioral and physical health needs within their service\
  \ area;\n•\tDeliver integrated care coordination and case management across local\
  \ child services, supported by child and family-centered information sharing and\
  \ alignment of program eligibility and enrollment processes;\n•\tIncrease local\
  \ capacity to shift care for children at-risk for, or already in, out-of-home placement\
  \ to less costly and more effective home and community-based settings; and implement\
  \ one or more APMs that support the local integrated service delivery model and\
  \ promote accountability for improved outcomes, such as lower rates of opiate and\
  \ other substance use, as well as long-term health system sustainability."
