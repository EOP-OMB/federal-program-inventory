objective: "The purpose of this cooperative agreement funding opportunity is to support\
  \ the implementation of the Integrated Care for Kids (INCK) model with up to eight\
  \ (8) awardees. \n\nThe InCK Model is a child-centered state payment and local service\
  \ delivery model aimed at reducing expenditures and improving the quality of care\
  \ for children up to age 21 covered by Medicaid and CHIP through early identification\
  \ and treatment of priority health concerns like behavioral health conditions, and\
  \ physical health needs. CMS will award InCK Model cooperative agreements to partnerships\
  \ between state Medicaid agencies (hereafter called the \u201Cstate\u201D) and local\
  \ organizations (hereafter called the \u201CLead Organization\u201D) to leverage\
  \ and build on existing child programs. One or more state-driven alternative payment\
  \ models (APMs) will support these partnerships to improve the coordination and\
  \ quality of care through accountability for costs and outcomes.  Model Awardees\
  \ will develop local care delivery approaches and infrastructure to: \n\u2022\t\
  Identify, assess, and risk stratify children with or at-risk for significant behavioral\
  \ and physical health needs within their service area;\n\u2022\tDeliver integrated\
  \ care coordination and case management across local child services, supported by\
  \ child and family-centered information sharing and alignment of program eligibility\
  \ and enrollment processes;\n\u2022\tIncrease local capacity to shift care for children\
  \ at-risk for, or already in, out-of-home placement to less costly and more effective\
  \ home and community-based settings; and implement one or more APMs that support\
  \ the local integrated service delivery model and promote accountability for improved\
  \ outcomes, such as lower rates of opiate and other substance use, as well as long-term\
  \ health system sustainability."
