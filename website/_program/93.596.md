objective: "The Mandatory and Matching portion (or Child Care Entitlement or CCE)\
  \ of the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program consists of Mandatory funds\
  \ (which are 100% federal) and Matching funds (which require a State match and maintenance\
  \ of effort).  The Mandatory and Matching funds are made available in section 418\
  \ of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 618) and are not subject to annual appropriations.\
  \ Allocations of the Mandatory Funds are based on a State's Federal share of the\
  \ expenditures for the now-repealed AFDC-linked child care programs (AFDC/JOBS Child\
  \ Care, Transitional Child Care, and At-Risk Child Care) in 1994 or 1995, or the\
  \ average of 1992 through 1994, whichever was greater. A State is not required to\
  \ expend any State funds in order to receive its share of the Mandatory Funds. Previously,\
  \ the Mandatory and Matching funds provided about $2.9 billion in federal funding\
  \ per year for child care.  The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2)\
  \ was enacted March 11, 2021 and appropriated $3,550,000,000 (Section 9801) in mandatory\
  \ and matching funding for CCDF, which is a permanent annual appropriation effective\
  \ fiscal year 2021. The appropriation includes $3.375 billion to States, $75 million\
  \ to Territories (previously not eligible), and $100 million to Tribes. \n To access\
  \ Matching Funds, a State must obligate all of its Mandatory Funds allotted in a\
  \ fiscal year and maintain 100% of the State's share of expenditures for the former\
  \ programs in fiscal year 1994 or fiscal year 1995, whichever is greater (i.e.,\
  \ maintenance of effort). Matching Funds must be matched at the applicable Federal\
  \ Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate, which is the Medicaid Program matching\
  \ rate. The Matching Funds are distributed based on the number of children under\
  \ age 13 in a State compared with the national total of children under age 13. \
  \ Section 9801 of the ARP Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2) appropriated $3.375 billion\
  \ in CCDF Mandatory and Matching funds to States. Because the state Mandatory fund\
  \ amount remains fixed in law, the $512,250,000 increase appropriated to states\
  \ by the ARP Act are awarded in Matching funds. Matching funds are available to\
  \ states if three conditions are met by the end of the fiscal year in which the\
  \ funds are awarded: (1) all Mandatory funds are obligated; (2) the state’s Maintenance-of-Effort\
  \ funds are expended; and (3) the state provides its share of Matching funds at\
  \ the FMAP rate. However, states are not required to match the additional funds\
  \ awarded in section 9801 of the ARP Act in FY 2021 or FY 2022.  Section 9801 of\
  \ the ARP Act appropriated CCDF Mandatory funds to territories for the first time,\
  \ including American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern\
  \ Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. Mandatory funds\
  \ to territories are allotted based on the number of children under age five living\
  \ in territories and per capita income in the territories. Territory Mandatory funds\
  \ are not subject to any matching requirements. Territory Mandatory funds must be\
  \ obligated in the fiscal year that they are awarded and liquidated in the following\
  \ year.\n\nNot less than 1%, but not more than 2% of the total Mandatory and Matching\
  \ Funds are reserved for Tribes and tribal organizations based on the number of\
  \ children living on or near Tribal reservations or other appropriate area served\
  \ by the tribal recipient. Tribes and tribal organizations are not required to provide\
  \ matching funds.  Prior to the ARP Act, Tribal lead agencies received a proportion\
  \ of the child care funds appropriated under Section 418 of the Social Security\
  \ Act.  Section 9801 of the ARP Act of 2021 (P. L. 117-2) amended the Social Security\
  \ Act to explicitly appropriate $100 million in Mandatory funds to Tribal lead agencies.\
  \ This increases the initial FY 2021 Mandatory funds awarded to Tribal lead agencies\
  \ by 70 percent. Otherwise, the requirements for Tribal Mandatory funds remain the\
  \ same. Mandatory funds to Tribes are allocated based on the number of children\
  \ under the age of 13 in a Tribe’s service area. In addition to the block grants\
  \ to States, Territories and Tribes, a small portion of the CCDF is used by the\
  \ Office of Child Care to provide technical assistance to lead agencies on administering\
  \ the program. A small portion of CCDF is also used for child care research, demonstration\
  \ and evaluation activities."
