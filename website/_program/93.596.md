objective: "The Mandatory and Matching portion (or Child Care Entitlement or CCE)\
  \ of the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program consists of three formula\
  \ grant programs and one program grant. The purpose of the three formula grants\
  \ funds is to help certain families with low incomes access child care and to improve\
  \ the quality of child care for all children. The Mandatory and Matching funds are\
  \ made available in section 418 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 618) and are\
  \ not subject to annual appropriations. \nThe first formula grant program is formula\
  \ grants to States and DC. These include \nMandatory funds (which are 100% federal)\
  \ and Matching funds (which require a State match and maintenance of effort).  Allocations\
  \ of the Mandatory Funds are based on a State's Federal share of the expenditures\
  \ for the now-repealed AFDC-linked child care programs (AFDC/JOBS Child Care, Transitional\
  \ Child Care, and At-Risk Child Care) in 1994 or 1995, or the average of 1992 through\
  \ 1994, whichever was greater. A State is not required to expend any State funds\
  \ in order to receive its share of the Mandatory Funds. \nMatching funds are available\
  \ to states if three conditions are met by the end of the fiscal year in which the\
  \ funds are awarded: (1) all Mandatory funds are obligated; (2) the state’s Maintenance-of-Effort\
  \ funds are expended; and (3) the state provides its share of Matching funds at\
  \ the FMAP rate. The Matching Funds are distributed based on the number of children\
  \ under age 13 in a State compared with the national total of children under age\
  \ 13.  \nThe second formula grant is Mandatory funds to territories, including American\
  \ Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and\
  \ the Virgin Islands of the United States.  Territory Mandatory funds are allotted\
  \ based on the number of children under age five living in territories and per capita\
  \ income in the territories. Territory Mandatory funds are not subject to any matching\
  \ requirements. Each year, Territories receive $75 million in Mandatory funding.\
  \ Territory Mandatory funds must be obligated in the fiscal year that they are awarded\
  \ and liquidated in the following year; however, in certain circumstances, unobligated\
  \ funds may be reobligated in subsequent fiscal years.  \n\nThe third formula grant\
  \ is Mandatory funds to Tribal Lead Agencies. Tribal Mandatory funds are not subject\
  \ to any matching requirements.  Each year, Tribal Lead Agencies receive $100 million\
  \ in Tribal Mandatory funds. Mandatory funds to Tribes are allocated based on the\
  \ number of children under the age of 13 in a Tribe’s service area. Lastly, in addition\
  \ to the block grants to States, Territories and Tribes, a small program grant is\
  \ used by the Office of Child Care to provide technical assistance to lead agencies\
  \ on administering the program. A small portion of CCDF is also used for child care\
  \ research, demonstration and evaluation activities."
