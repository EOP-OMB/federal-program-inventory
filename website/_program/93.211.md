objective: The purpose of the Telehealth Network Program (TNGP) is to fund programs
  that demonstrate how telehealth networks improve healthcare services in rural communities.
  The Telehealth Resource Centers (TRCs) are designed to expand the availability of
  technical assistance in the development of telehealth services, leveraging the experience
  of mature programs with expertise in providing and implementing telehealth services.  The
  Licensure Portability Grant Program (LPGP) supports state professional licensing
  boards to carry out programs under which licensing boards of various states cooperate
  to develop and implement state laws and related policies that will reduce statutory
  and regulatory barriers to the provision of health care services through telemedicine
  technology.  The Evidence-Based Telehealth Network Program (EB-TNP)  increases access
  to healthcare services utilizing Direct to Consumer technologies. It enhances the
  existing health care infrastructure and increases access to care for underserved
  populations utilizing synchronous video visits and remote patient monitoring for
  primary focus areas such as behavioral health, primary care, and acute care. It
  also expands access to services for rural patients and conducts evaluations of those
  efforts to establish an evidence base for assessing the effectiveness of telehealth
  care for patients, providers, and payers. The Telehealth Centers of Excellence (COEs)
  assess specific telehealth uses, operate as incubators to pilot, track and refine
  telehealth, examine the efficacy of telehealth services in rural and urban areas
  and explore new telehealth applications for telehealth research and resources.  The
  Telehealth Technology-Enabled Learning Program (TTELP) purpose is to connect specialists
  at academic medical centers with primary care providers in rural and underserved
  areas, providing evidence-based training and support to help them treat patients
  with complex conditions in their communities. The Telehealth Broadband Pilot (TBP)
  Program aims to assess the broadband capacity available to rural healthcare providers
  and patient communities and to improve their ability to participate in telehealth
  services through cross-agency collaboration.  The Telehealth Focused Rural Health
  Research Center program is designed to increase the amount of publicly available,
  high quality, impartial, policy-relevant research to assist decision makers at the
  federal, state, and local levels to better understand the challenges faced by rural
  and underserved communities and providers.

    Pilot (TBP) Program • In 2021, TTAC, the program implementation grantee, formed
    a formal Steering Committee to guide the TBP Program, and established a Data Analysis
    Technical Design Committee to design the technology to measure broadband.  TTAC
    entered into the beta testing phase, readying 65 broadband assessment devices
    for deployment among four states.  • RTEC, the evaluation grantee, mapped and
    assessed broadband capacity across several existing programs and states, using
    existing public broadband data.  RTEC also created a survey for implementation
    across the four states to understand perceived benefits and barriers of expanding
    broadband capacity for telehealth service, including willingness-to-pay. Account
    Identification • In the first six months of the Telehealth Technology-Enabled
    Learning Program (TTELP), more than 100 ECHO telementoring sessions reached over
    100 different organizations from all fifty states.'
