objective: The Farm to School Cooperative Agreement solicitation is open to organizations
  with experience providing technical assistance support and services that further
  expand farm to school initiatives. These Cooperative agreements allow more involvement
  and collaboration by FNS in the project compared to grants and provide fewer directions
  of project activities than a contract. FNS will coordinate with the cooperative
  agreement partners and stakeholders.
