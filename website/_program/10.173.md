- description: "The Sheep Production and Marketing Grant Program (SPMGP) has significantly\
    \ bolstered the U.S. sheep industry through targeted funding and strategic initiatives.\
    \ Notable accomplishments include:\nNational Sheep Industry Improvement Center\
    \ (NSIIC) Funding:\nThe NSIIC has provided subawards to projects that develop\
    \ solutions for practical problems and address the needs of the entire sheep industry,\
    \ focusing on measurable benefits for sheep producers, encouraging partnerships\
    \ among sheep industry organizations, and reducing duplication of effort among\
    \ participating organizations. \nExpansion of the Grass-Fed Program:\nThe USDA\
    \ extended its Grass-Fed Program for Small and Very Small Producers to include\
    \ sheep, enabling producers marketing lambs from 99 head of ewes or fewer per\
    \ year to receive certification. This initiative allowed producers to market their\
    \ sheep as USDA-certified grass-fed, thereby increasing market value and creating\
    \ new economic opportunities."
