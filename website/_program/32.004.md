objective: The schools and libraries universal service support program, commonly known
  as the E-Rate program, helps eligible schools and libraries to obtain affordable
  broadband services, internal connections, and maintenance of internal connections.  The
  E-Rate program was authorized by Congress as part of the Telecommunications Act
  of 1996 (the Telecommunications Act), and created by the Federal Communications
  Commission (FCC or Commission) in 1997 to, among other things, enhance, to the extent
  technically feasible and economically reasonable, access to advanced telecommunications
  and information services for all public and nonprofit elementary and secondary schools
  and libraries.
