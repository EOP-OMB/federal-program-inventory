objective: "To further CMS\u2019 mission and goals related to providing high quality\
  \ health care to the American Indian/Alaska Native  (AI/AN) community by providing\
  \ research and analysis to increase the understanding of, access to, and impact\
  \ of CMS\u2019 programs in Indian Country. \r\n\r\nCongress authorized AI/ANs to\
  \ have access to Medicare and Medicaid services when provided through Indian Health\
  \ Service (IHS) facilities located in tribal communities and amended titles XVIII\
  \ and XIX of the Social Security Act to permit IHS facilities to bill Medicare and\
  \ Medicaid for services provided to eligible AI/ANs. This authority was later extended\
  \ to tribal facilities.  Congress has also provided authority for Indian health\
  \ care programs and beneficiaries to participate in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance\
  \ program and the Health Insurance Marketplace.  \r\nThese changes have created\
  \ a direct relationship between CMS and the Indian Health Service, The research\
  \ conducted under this cooperative agreement is needed to help improve administration\
  \ of CMS\u2019 programs given that CMS and IHS programs operate under different\
  \ and sometimes competing authorities for CMS\u2019 programs, the Social Security\
  \ Act and for IHS\u2019 programs, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and the\
  \ Indian Self Determination Education and Assistance Act, P.L. 93-638. To make CMS\u2019\
  \ programs work with Indian health program authorities, a crucial first is step\
  \ is for CMS to understand the impact of its policies on Indian health care providers\
  \ and tribal members so that the agency can provide the AI/AN community greater\
  \ access to CMS\u2019 programs  in an effective and efficient manner.  \r\n\r\n\
  The authority at Section 1110 of the Social Security Act permits CMS to enter into\
  \ grants andcooperative arrangements with organizations and certain other entities\
  \ in order to aid in improving administration and effectiveness of programs administered\
  \ by the agency. To this end, the work conducted under this cooperative agreement\
  \ will address the potential and actual impacts of CMS\u2019 programs on AI/ANs\
  \ and the health care system serving these beneficiaries. CMS\u2019 understanding\
  \ of the impact of its policies is vital to improving greater AI/AN access to and\
  \ participation in CMS\u2019 programs; improving and ensuring that appropriate health\
  \ care payments and resources are provided to IHS  tribal, and urban Indian Health\
  \ program providers; and contributing to overall improved health outcomes for Indian\
  \ people.  The information and activities produced  or provided under the cooperative\
  \ agreement will be used to develop culturally appropriate activities and strategies\
  \ to improve how CMS\u2019 program operate and are administered in Indian country.\r\
