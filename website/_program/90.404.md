- description: 'State activities in 2022 continued to be impacted by threats to election
    security and the increasing cost of administering elections. Several states reported
    activities to mitigate cyber and physical security threats, including making improvements
    to election systems infrastructure, securing virtual and physical access to systems
    and equipment, cybersecurity monitoring and testing, physical surveillance for
    election facilities and drop boxes, and security training and exercises for election
    officials. State

    spending on cyber and physical security and for maintaining and securing voter
    registration systems has increased 23% and 29% respectively since 2021. As of
    September 30, 2022, states have reported spending $498,265,605 or 56% of the Election
    Security funds and interest earned.

    The EACâ€™s review of state progress reports identified various themes across state
    activities to enhance election security and improve the administration of federal
    elections. Security training and exercises were common activities across states,
    irrespective of their relative size or population density. 22 states, including
    Alaska, Maine, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wisconsin, used funds for election
    security training, including workshops and tabletop exercises in partnership with
    CISA as well as and state and national conferences for election officials. These
    trainings covered a variety of topics such as cyber hygiene, risk mitigation,
    information security, system monitoring, cybersecurity awareness, and incident
    preparedness.

    States continue to conduct regular security assessments of their election systems
    and enhance their cybersecurity infrastructure. Eighteen states reported using
    funds to make infrastructural improvements at both the state and the local level,
    including increased physical security measures, upgrades and modernization of
    system hardware and software, and services for risk remediation and monitoring
    of election systems and networks. Additionally, 11 states have used funding for
    dedicated security staffing, including cybersecurity and election security specialists.
    Several states such as Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, and Virginia have implemented
    cyber navigator programs through which they employ election technology specialists
    to provide practical cybersecurity knowledge, training, and support services for
    local election officials. In 2022, over 57% of states spent funds on maintaining,
    securing, and upgrading their statewide voter registration systems. Voter registration
    activities included improvements to online voter registration processes and security,
    modernization and replacement of system components, implementation of multi-factor
    authentication, and improvements to system networks to allow local election jurisdictions
    to connect to the statewide voter registration system. States are continuing to
    upgrade

    and replace aging voting equipment to increase election security and improve voting
    processes and voter experience. Forty-three percent of states reported purchasing
    equipment such as new ballot tabulators, epollbooks, ballot printers, voting machines,
    absentee and mail-in ballot counters, and accessible ballot marking devices. The
    rise in threats to election security and growing distrust in the election process
    has resulted in a growing focus on voting and election transparency. More than
    a

    dozen states prioritized activities that increase election transparency including
    ballot tracking and

    curing resources for voters, public databases of historical election results,
    livestreamed ballot counts, and voter education campaigns to combat mis- and disinformation.'
