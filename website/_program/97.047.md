objective: 'The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program makes
  federal funds available to states, U.S territories, federally recognized tribal
  governments, and local communities for hazard mitigation activities. The guiding
  principles of the program are to (1) support state and local governments, tribes,
  and territories through capability- and capacity-building to enable them to identify
  mitigation actions and implement projects that reduce risks posed by natural hazards;
  (2) encourage and enable innovation while allowing flexibility, consistency, and
  effectiveness; (3) promote partnerships and enable high-impact investments to reduce
  risk from natural hazards with a focus on critical services and facilities, public
  infrastructure, public safety, public health, and communities; (4) provide a significant
  opportunity to reduce future losses and minimize impacts on the Disaster Relief
  Fund; (5) promote equity, including by helping members of overburdened and underservedvulnerable
  groups; and (6) support the adoption and enforcement of building codes, standards,
  and policies that will protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public,
  take into account future conditions, prominently including the effects of climate
  change, and have long-lasting impacts on community risk reduction, including for
  critical services and facilities and for future disaster costs.


  The FY 2022 Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Grant Program is to fund Congressional
  Community Projects for state, local, tribal, and territorial government efforts
  to plan for and implement sustainable cost-effective measures designed to reduce
  the risk to individuals and property from future natural hazards, while also reducing
  reliance on federal funding from future disasters.'
