objective: The Inflation Reduction Act amends the Clean Air Act to include Section
  134 (42 USC § 7434), which authorizes the EPA to make competitive grants for Zero-Emissions
  Technologies.  EPA awarded $7 billion in competitive grants to implement Clean Air
  Act Section 134 (a)(1) through the Solar for All program, which will prioritize
  residential and community solar projects, as well as storage technologies and upgrades
  related to these projects. In FY 2025 sixty (60) grant recipients will create new
  or expand existing low-income solar programs which will enable over 900,000 households
  in low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from distributed solar energy.
  This program will deliver on the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund’s objectives by reducing
  greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollution, delivering cost savings on electric
  bills for overburdened households, and unlocking new markets for distributed solar
  in states and territories that have never had a statewide low-income solar program
  before.
