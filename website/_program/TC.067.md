objective: The baseline tax system accepts current law’s general rule limiting taxpayers’
  ability to deduct losses from passive activities against nonpassive income (e.g.,
  wages, interest, and dividends). Passive activities generally are defined as those
  in which the taxpayer does not materially participate, and there are numerous additional
  considerations brought to bear on the determination of which activities are passive
  for a given taxpayer. Losses are limited in an attempt to limit tax sheltering activities.
  Passive losses that are unused may be carried forward and applied against future
  passive income. In contrast to the general restrictions on passive losses, the Tax
  Code exempts certain owners of rental real estate activities from “passive income”
  limitations. The exemption is limited to $25,000 in losses and phases out for taxpayers
  with income between $100,000 and $150,000.
