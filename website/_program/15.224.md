objective: "The purpose of the program is to manage cultural and paleontological resources\
  \ to benefit the public. \nBLM manages archaeological and historic sites, artifact\
  \ collections, places of traditional cultural importance to American Indians and\
  \ other communities, and paleontological resources that occur on million acres of\
  \ federal lands. Collectively, these “heritage resources” represent over thousands\
  \ of years of human occupation, and millions of years of the earth’s natural history.\
  \ BLM Cultural Heritage and Paleontology Programs coordinate management, preservation,\
  \ education and outreach efforts, economic opportunities, and public uses of a fragile,\
  \ nonrenewable scientific record that represents an important component of America’s\
  \ heritage. \nThe BLM Cultural Heritage and Paleontology Resource Management Programs\
  \ seek to establish partnerships that collaboratively encourage the public to learn\
  \ about and engage with heritage resources on public lands, restoring trust and\
  \ being a good neighbor. The Cultural Heritage and Paleontology Resource Management\
  \ Programs achieve these goals by:  Protecting and preserving cultural heritage\
  \ and paleontological resources for the benefit of future generations; Improving\
  \ professional and/or public understanding of the nation’s cultural and natural\
  \ history; Providing educational, recreational, and economic opportunities for local\
  \ communities and the public; Increasing American Indian access to locations and\
  \ natural resources important to traditional cultural practices and beliefs; and\
  \ Managing heritage resource collections and associated records to appropriate standards,\
  \ and providing access to the public and American Indians.\nThe BLM is responsible\
  \ for the largest, most diverse and scientifically important aggregation of cultural,\n\
  historical, and paleontological resources on the public lands, as well as the associated\
  \ museum collections\nand data."
