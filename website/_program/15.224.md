objective: "The purpose of the program is to manage cultural and paleontological resources\
  \ to benefit the public. The\nprogram also provides support and guidance on consultation\
  \ with Native American Tribes, specifically on\ncultural resource issues, and also\
  \ provides technical support and guidance.\nBLM manages archaeological and historic\
  \ sites, artifact collections, places of traditional cultural importance to American\
  \ Indians and other communities, and paleontological resources that occur on million\
  \ acres of federal lands. Collectively, these \u201Cheritage resources\u201D represent\
  \ over years of human occupation, and millions of years of the earth\u2019s natural\
  \ history. BLM Cultural Heritage and Paleontology Programs coordinate management,\
  \ preservation, education and outreach efforts, economic opportunities, and public\
  \ uses of a fragile, nonrenewable scientific record that represents an important\
  \ component of America\u2019s heritage. \nThe BLM Cultural Heritage and Paleontology\
  \ Resource Management Programs seek to establish partnerships that collaboratively\
  \ encourage the public to learn about and engage with heritage resources on public\
  \ lands, restoring trust and being a good neighbor, and sustainably developing energy\
  \ and natural resources. The Cultural Heritage and Paleontology Resource Management\
  \ Programs achieve these goals by:  Protecting and preserving cultural heritage\
  \ and paleontological resources for the benefit of future generations; Improving\
  \ professional and/or public understanding of the nation\u2019s cultural and natural\
  \ history; Providing educational, recreational, and economic opportunities for local\
  \ communities and the public; Increasing American Indian access to locations and\
  \ natural resources important to traditional cultural practices and beliefs; and\
  \ Managing heritage resource collections and associated records to appropriate standards,\
  \ and providing access to the public and American Indians.\nThe BLM is responsible\
  \ for the largest, most diverse and scientifically important aggregation of cultural,\n\
  historical, and paleontological resources on the public lands, as well as the associated\
  \ museum collections\nand data.\nThis program continues to advance the Department\
  \ of Interior\u2019s priorities to create a conservation stewardship legacy while\
  \ generating revenue and utilizing our natural resources. BLM\u2019s continued commitment\
  \ to reduce and streamline its processes and procedures to serve its customers and\
  \ the public better and faster across all its program areas. These reforms allow\
  \ the Bureau to realign time and resources to completing important on\u2013the-groundwork."
