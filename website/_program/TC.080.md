objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates, or
  deferral of tax, to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, current
  law allows the deferral of accrued gains on assets transferred in qualified likekind
  exchanges.
