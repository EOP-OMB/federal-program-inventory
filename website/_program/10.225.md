  \ of the food system \nand to foster understanding of national food security trends\
  \ and how they might improve local \nfood systems. Understanding that low-income\

  \ access, \navailability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote\
  \ well-being. Communities that \nare partially or fully located in Opportunity Zones\
