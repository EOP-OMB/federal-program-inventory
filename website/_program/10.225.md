objective: "The CFPCGP is intended to bring together stakeholders from distinct parts\
  \ of the food system \nand to foster understanding of national food security trends\
  \ and how they might improve local \nfood systems. Understanding that low-income\
  \ individuals experience disproportionate access to \nhealthy foods, projects are\
  \ to address food and nutrition insecurity, particularly among our \nnationâ€™s most\
  \ vulnerable populations. Nutrition Security is defined as having consistent access,\
  \ \navailability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being.\
  \ Communities that \nare partially or fully located in Opportunity Zones are particularly\
  \ encouraged to apply."
