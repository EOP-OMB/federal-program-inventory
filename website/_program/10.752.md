objective: 'The ReConnect Program provides loans, grants, and loan/grant combination
  awards to facilitate broadband deployment in rural areas. An essential goal of the
  ReConnect Program is to expand broadband service to rural areas without sufficient
  access to broadband, defined at the time of the funding notice (at a minimum: 10
  megabits per second (Mbps) downstream and 1 Mbps upstream). In facilitating the
  expansion of broadband services and infrastructure, the program will fuel long-term
  rural economic development and opportunities in rural America.'
