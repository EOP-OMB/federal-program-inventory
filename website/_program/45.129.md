objective: Federal/State Partnerships promote local, statewide, and regional humanities
  programming through annual grants to humanities councils in each of the fifty states,
  the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana
  Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. The humanities councils use those grants to conduct
  humanities projects and grant programs for local nonprofit organizations, institutions,
  and groups, and occasionally for individuals. Under the provisions of 20 U.S.C.
  956(f)(8), only one entity in each state may receive assistance from NEH as the
  state humanities council.
