objective: "EM research and development and validation testing (R&DT) provides necessary\
  \ investments in mid- to long-range activities to address the technological gaps\
  \ in defense environmental cleanup, including: (1) radioactive liquid and solid\
  \ waste treatment, storage and disposal; (2) soil and groundwater remediation; (3)\
  \ nuclear materials and spent fuel management and disposition; (4) facility deactivation\
  \ and decommissioning; and (5) public, worker, facility/asset, and environmental\
  \ safety and security. EM R&DT investments seek high-payoff, game-changing technologies\
  \ and innovations to positively impact EM\u2019s program lifecycle baseline by:\
  \ (1) reducing costs; (2) accelerating schedules; (3) mitigating mission uncertainties,\
  \ vulnerabilities, and risks; and (4) minimizing the mortgage associated with long-term,\
  \ post-closure and post-completion stewardship. EM R&DT also provides the opportunity\
  \ to perform work and operate facilities more effectively and in a manner that assures\
  \ public, worker and environmental safely.  New and novel technologies as well as\
  \ innovative solutions are needed to address the significant challenges associated\
  \ with the remaining nuclear cleanup work that will span the next five decades.\
  \  The program encompasses the entire maturation lifecycle of technology which includes\
  \ transfer of technologies from other nuclear and non-nuclear industry sectors.\n\
  \nEM\u2019s technology portfolio will leverage and harness the expertise, resources,\
  \ and capabilities of US universities and colleges.  Academia will support EM in\
  \ four distinct roles: (1) as an expert-based resource for conducting early-stage\
  \ and applied scientific research and for providing engineering solutions; (2) as\
  \ a pool of recognized subject matter experts to support technical peer reviews\
  \ and independent technical assessments; (3) as incubators and pipelines for EM\u2019\
  s future workforce; and (4) as a source of independent testing, verification, and\
  \ confirmatory evaluation. EM will work to improve the technical training of its\
  \ workforce through Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education,\
  \ experiential learning, and apprenticeships.\n\nEM R&DT supports the safety and\
  \ quality of permanent containment and confinement ventilation systems as well as\
  \ modular worksite and breathing-zone ventilation systems used to support nuclear,\
  \ radiological, chemical, and other high-consequence facility and environmental\
  \ operations. Future funds will be executed to: (1) conduct basic and early-stage\
  \ applied research, particularly in areas that lead to the basis of the development,\
  \ transfer and industrial utilization (commercialization) of new clean air technologies;\
  \ (2) perform design-specification and quality control inspection, testing and evaluation\
  \ of existing, newly available, and emerging designs of High-Efficiency Particulate\
  \ Air (HEPA) filters and other air filtration technologies; (3) perform testing\
  \ and evaluation of HEPA filter performance in design-basis and off-normal operating\
  \ conditions as well as in scenarios of major plant or system failures; (4) perform\
  \ computer modeling and computational (numerical) simulation of airflow dynamics,\
  \ including multiphase flow, particle tracking, evaporation, combustion, convection,\
  \ conduction, and radiation heat transfer; (5) perform in-depth engineering analysis\
  \ of complex fluid flows, including detailed flow characteristics such as velocity,\
  \ pressure, turbulence, temperature, and species concentration for internal or external\
  \ flows; (6) support the research and development of new and plant-specific designs\
  \ of air filtration technologies, including in-line sensors and measurement devices;\
  \ and (7) complementary and alternative technologies, such as robotics and remote\
  \ systems, to support the inspection and maintenance of ventilation systems as critical\
  \ infrastructure. As air filtration systems perform critical safety functions in\
  \ many high-consequence facilities, continued focus on the quality of commercial,\
  \ off-the-self technologies as well as on the advancing state-of-the-art must be\
  \ maintained to assure safety and quality in environmental management operations.\n\
  \nSpecific to HEPA filters, R&DT under various normal and upset test conditions\
  \ will help determine valuable operational information (i.e., develop suggested\
  \ controls and operational methods, and identify failure modes) that can be applied\
  \ at various commercial and Government/military facilities that treat, store, or\
  \ process nuclear material or waste streams (e.g. commercial nuclear power facilities),\
  \ or filter out hazardous particulates or dust for commercial microelectronic clean\
  \ rooms or hospital operations. This R&DT may increase the protective nature of\
  \ the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) AG-1 Code (Code on Nuclear\
  \ Air and Gas Treatment), enhance the ability of professionals to design filters\
  \ and air filtration systems, and reduce uncertainty in the development of standard\
  \ operating procedures for facilities involved in nuclear containment ventilation\
  \ activities. Improving the durability of HEPA filters used in nuclear containment\
  \ is a key component in protecting the worker and general population in the event\
  \ of a fire at a nuclear facility, particularly segments of the population near\
  \ nuclear facilities."
