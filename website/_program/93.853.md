objective: '(1) To support extramural research funded by the National Institute of
  Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) including: basic research that explores
  the fundamental structure and function of the brain and the nervous system; research
  to understand the causes and origins of pathological conditions of the nervous system
  with the goal of preventing these disorders; research on the natural course of neurological
  disorders; improved methods of disease prevention; new methods of diagnosis and
  treatment; drug development; development of neural devices; clinical trials; and
  research training in basic, translational and clinical neuroscience. The Institute
  is the largest funder of basic neuroscience in the US and supports research on topics
  including but not limited to: development of the nervous system, including neurogenesis
  and progenitor cell biology, signal transduction in development and plasticity,
  and programmed cell death; synapse formation, function, and plasticity;  learning
  and memory; channels, transporters, and pumps; circuit formation and modulation;  behavioral
  and cognitive neuroscience; sensorimotor learning, integration and executive function;
  neuroendocrine systems; sleep and circadian rhythms; and sensory and motor systems.  In
  addition, the Institute supports basic, translational and clinical studies on a
  number of disorders of the nervous system including (but not limited to): stroke;
  traumatic injury to the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system; neurodegenerative
  disorders; movement disorders; brain tumors; convulsive disorders; infectious disorders
  of the brain and nervous system; immune disorders of the brain and nervous system,
  including multiple sclerosis; disorders related to sleep; and pain. Programmatic
  areas, which are primarily supported by the Division of Neuroscience, are also supported
  by the Division of Extramural Activities, the Division of Translational Research,
  the Division of Clinical Research, the Office of Training and Workforce Development,
  the Office of Programs to Enhance Neuroscience Workforce Development, and the Office
  of International Activities. (2) To expand and improve the Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) program; to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
  derived from Federal research and development; to increase small business participation
  in Federal research and development; and to foster and encourage participation of
  socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
  small business concerns in technological innovation. To utilize the Small Business
  Technology Transfer (STTR) program; to stimulate and foster scientific and technological
  innovation through cooperative research and development carried out between small
  business concerns and research institutions; to foster technology transfer between
  small business concerns and research institutions; to increase private sector commercialization
  of innovations derived from Federal research and development; and to foster and
  encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged small business
  concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological innovation.'
