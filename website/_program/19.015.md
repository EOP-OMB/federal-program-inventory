objective: To assist various organizations identified by Congress to achieve objectives
  specified by Congress.  As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, the Bureau of Educational
  and Cultural Affairs (ECA) seeks to increase mutual understanding between the people
  of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and
  cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals,
  students, and educators.  Educational and cultural engagement is premised on the
  knowledge that mutual understanding, the development of future leaders, and the
  benefits of education programs influence societies and affect official decision-making
  almost everywhere in the world today.
