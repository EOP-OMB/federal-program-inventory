objective: "Goal:  To provide veterans treatment courts and criminal justice professionals\
  \ with the resources needed to implement, enhance, and sustain evidence-based treatment\
  \ and recovery support programs and systems for eligible veterans in the criminal\
  \ justice system who have substance use disorders.\n\nObjective:  The Veterans Treatment\
  \ Court (VTC) Discretionary Grant Program provides financial and technical assistance\
  \ to states, state courts, local courts, units of local government, and federally\
  \ recognized Indian tribal governments to implement or enhance the operations of\
  \ veterans treatment courts. These courts effectively integrate evidence- based\
  \ substance use disorder treatment, mandatory drug testing, incentives and sanctions,\
  \ and transitional services in judicially supervised court settings that have jurisdiction\
  \ over veterans in the criminal justice system who have substance use disorders,\
  \ including those with a history of violence and post-traumatic stress disorder\
  \ (PTSD) and/or traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a result of their military service.\n\
  \nPerformance Measure 1:  Number of participants who graduated from the VTC program;\
  \ \n \nPerformance Measure 2: Percent of participants who graduate from the VTC\
  \ program; and,  \n\nPerformance Measure 3: Percentage of treatment court graduates\
  \ who committed a new criminal offense within 24 months of completing the program."
