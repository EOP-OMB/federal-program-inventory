objective: 'To support data providers for the National Ground-Water Monitoring Network.
  The National Ground-Water Monitoring Network (NGWMN) is a cooperative, integrated
  system of data collection, management, and reporting that will provide data needed
  to address groundwater management questions. Assistance is provided to new and existing
  data providers of the National Ground-Water Monitoring Network. The program will
  provide support to state or local Water-Resource agencies which collect groundwater
  data to serve as data providers for the National Ground-Water Monitoring Network.
  Support will allow the data providers to perform tasks to get their data into the
  Network such as: selecting and categorizing their wells within NGWMN specifications,
  adding sites to the network, establishing and maintaining connections between their
  databases and the NGWMN Portal. Support will also allow agencies to maintain their
  connections to the NGWMN Portal and to enhance their networks to provide better
  data to the NGWMN.'
