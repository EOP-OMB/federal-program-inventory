objective: "The Emergency Relief Program (ERP) is intended to help agricultural producers\
  \ offset the impacts of natural disasters in 2020 and 2021. Congress included emergency\
  \ funding in the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance\
  \ Act (P.L. 117-43). ERP\u2019s first round of disaster funding provided payments\
  \ to producers using existing data and did not require outreach because producers\
  \ were automatically enrolled in the program. The second phase of ERP is aimed at\
  \ filling gaps and providing assistance to producers who did not participate in\
  \ or receive payments through the existing risk management programs that were leveraged\
  \ for phase 1 implementation. \n\nPhase 2 of ERP will provide assistance to producers\
  \ who suffered losses due to qualifying natural disasters in 2020 and 2021. This\
  \ program will be revenue based and will require participation in a risk management\
  \ program for the next two crop years. These eligibility criteria and risk management\
  \ linkage requirements create unique needs around outreach and technical assistance\
  \ for this program. Producers will need to supply information to FSA that would\
  \ typically be found on their Schedule F tax forms, and if they have not filed a\
  \ Schedule F, be able to supply acceptable revenue records or create the required\
  \ application data from their own farm records.  Producers will also need to identify\
  \ and enroll in the appropriate risk management program for their operation.\n \n\
  The assistance ERP program participants will need in order to supply application\
  \ information will be unique to their individual operation and tax situation, and\
  \ more technical than the information we typically provide as part of general outreach\
  \ and program education. As a result, the communication, technical support, and\
  \ outreach strategies around ERP for producers need to be focused, targeted and\
  \ technical in nature. This program also offers the opportunity to connect with\
  \ producers who have not worked with their local FSA office, and an opportunity\
  \ to not only participate in ERP but also serve as a gateway to risk management\
  \ tools and other FSA and USDA programs and services. FSA has $8 million available\
  \ for cooperative agreements to provide outreach and technical assistance for the\
  \ Emergency Relief Program Phase 2. \n\nThe Farm Service Agency (FSA), an agency\
  \ of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), seeks to partner with stakeholder\
  \ organizations to effectively reach producers, including those that are small,\
  \ underserved, and not currently participating in existing programs who did not\
  \ apply under phase 1 of the ERP program.  FSA is seeking proposals from eligible\
  \ entities that focus on outreach for increasing awareness about ERP and have the\
  \ primary goal of connecting landowners interested in program participation to apply\
  \ under a traditional FSA application process. \n\nExpeditated outreach by stakeholders\
  \ should include:\n\u2022\tTechnical assistance support\n\u2022\tTools for nontraditional\
  \ customers\n\u2022\tOffice hours for stakeholders\n\u2022\tTargeted, timely stakeholder\
  \ feedback on areas that need improvement."
