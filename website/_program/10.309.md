objective: "The purpose of the SCRI program is to addressthe critical needs of the\
  \ specialty crop industry\n(as defined in Appendix III) by awarding grants to support\
  \ research and extension that address\nkey challenges of national, regional, and\
  \ multi-state importance in sustaining all components of\nfood and agriculture,\
  \ including conventional and organic food production systems. The program \nrecognizes\
  \ that for some specialty crops which are grown in a limited number of states, the\
  \ multi\x02state nature of projects can be difficult to address. Except for Research\
  \ and Extension Planning\nProjects, the SCRI program only considers projects that\
  \ integrate research and extension\nactivities. Applicants are strongly encouraged\
  \ to propose a unique approach to solving problems\nfacing the specialty crop industry\
  \ using a systems approach."
