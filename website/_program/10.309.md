objective: "The purpose of the SCRI program is to address the critical needs of the\
  \ specialty crop industry by awarding grants to support research and extension that\
  \ address\nkey challenges of national, regional, and multi-state importance in sustaining\
  \ all components of\nfood and agriculture, including conventional and organic food\
  \ production systems. The program \nrecognizes that for some specialty crops which\
  \ are grown in a limited number of states, the multi-state nature of projects can\
  \ be difficult to address. Except for Research and Extension Planning\nProjects,\
  \ the SCRI program only considers projects that integrate research and extension\n\
  activities. Applicants are strongly encouraged to propose a unique approach to solving\
  \ problems\nfacing the specialty crop industry using a systems approach."
