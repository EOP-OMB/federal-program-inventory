  agricultural producers about the full range of risk management activities to enhance
  profitability of their operations. These activities include futures, options, agricultural
  trade options, crop insurance, cash forward contracting, debt reduction, production
  diversification, marketing plans and tactics, farm resources risk reduction, and
  other appropriate risk management strategies. Further the National Institute of
  Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is required to place special emphasis on risk management
  strategies, education, and outreach specifically targeted at: (A) beginning farmers
  or ranchers; (B) legal immigrant farmers or ranchers that are attempting to become
  established producers in the United States; (C) socially disadvantaged farmers or
  ranchers; (D) farmers or ranchers that (i) are preparing to retire; and (ii) are
  using transition strategies to help new farmers or ranchers get started; and (E)
  new or established farmers or ranchers that are converting production and marketing
  systems to pursue new markets.'
