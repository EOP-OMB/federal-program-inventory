objective: "To establish a competitive grants program for the purpose of educating\
  \ agricultural producers about the full range of risk management activities to enhance\
  \ profitability of their operations. These activities include futures, options,\
  \ agricultural trade options, crop insurance, cash forward contracting, debt reduction,\
  \ production diversification, marketing plans and tactics, farm resources risk reduction,\
  \ and other appropriate risk management strategies. Further the National Institute\
  \ of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is required to place special emphasis on risk management\
  \ strategies, education, and outreach specifically targeted at: (A) beginning farmers\
  \ or ranchers; (B) legal immigrant farmers or ranchers that are attempting to become\
  \ established producers in the United States; (C) socially disadvantaged farmers\
  \ or ranchers; (D) farmers or ranchers that (i) are preparing to retire; and (ii)\
  \ are using transition strategies to help new farmers or ranchers get started; and\
  \ (E) new or established farmers or ranchers that are converting production and\
  \ marketing systems to pursue new markets.\n\nThe primary goals and objectives of\
  \ the ARME program are to 1) provide U.S. agricultural\nproducers and their families,\
  \ as appropriate, with the knowledge, skills, and tools needed to \nmake informed\
  \ risk management decisions that enhance profitability of their operations, and\
  \ 2) \ndeliver risk management education to agricultural producers underserved by\
  \ the Federal crop \ninsurance program."
