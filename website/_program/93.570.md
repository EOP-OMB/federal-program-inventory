objective: 'Community Services Block Grant Discretionary Awards includes three programs:
  Community Economic Development (CED), Rural Community Development (RCD) and the
  Neighborhood Innovation Projects (NIP). On an annual based Congress has only provided
  appropriations to CED and RCD programs. NIP has never received funding. CED program
  provides awards on a competitive basis to private, nonprofit organizations that
  are community development corporations (CDCs). The CDC provides technical and financial
  assistance for economic development activities that address the economic needs of
  individuals and families with low income, through the creation of sustainable business
  development and employment opportunities. CED funds are used for commercial developments
  and equity investments or loans to capitalize a new business or expand an existing
  business, so the businesses can create new, full-time permanent jobs for individuals
  with low incomes. CED allows communities to drive the type of investment and/or
  business to that which is most needed in the community. Seventy-five percent of
  the jobs created must be filled by individuals that are below 200% of HHS poverty
  guideline. In addition to the CED Projects Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO),
  CED has published three additional NOFOs that support communities with low-income
  that create business and job opportunities: (1) Community Economic Development Projects;
  (2) CED Focus on Social Enterprise (CED-SE); and (3) CED Planning Grant (CED-Planning).
  All the initiatives have the same objectives of the CED program: to create economic
  mobility opportunities for individuals with low-income. The CED-Projects and the
  CED-Planning awards are aligned with President Bidenâ€™s Executive Order 14008: Tackling
  the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad and the Justice40 initiative. The CED gives
  bonus points to projects  are located in Energy communities.  Energy communities
  are communities that have experienced employment loss and/or economic dislocation
  events because of declines in the fossil fuel industry and/or are disproportionately
  reliant on fossil fuel energy production or distribution, including coal, oil, gas,
  and power plant communities across the country. The CED-Planning initiative is to
  stimulate the development of new CED projects through the provision of resources
  that are used to support administrative and capacity building. The RCD program provides
  awards to multistate, regional, and tribal nonprofit organizations that provides
  training and technical assistance to small, rural communities for the improvement
  of drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities. RCD helps community members
  identify and address water and wastewater related issues, including infrastructure
  and accessibility needs; increase access for families with low incomes to water
  supply and waste disposal services; preserve affordable water and waste disposal
  services in low-income rural communities; train water operators to ensure water
  systems comply with federal regulations; increase local capacity and expertise to
  establish and maintain needed water facilities; increase economic opportunities
  for low-income rural communities by ensuring they have basic water and sanitation;
  utilize technical assistance to leverage additional public and private resources;
  promote improved coordination of federal, state, and local agencies and financing
  programs to benefit low-income communities; and help communities establish financial
  stability and financial reserves to maintain water delivery and wastewater disposal
  systems.'
