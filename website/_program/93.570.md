objective: "Community Services Block Grant Discretionary Awards includes three programs:\
  \ Community Economic Development (CED), Rural Community Development (RCD) and the\
  \ Neighborhood innovation projects (NIP). On an annual based Congress has only provided\
  \ appropriations to CED and RCD programs. NIP has never received funding. CED program\
  \ provides awards on a competitive basis to private, nonprofit organizations that\
  \ are community development corporations (CDCs). The CDC provides technical and\
  \ financial assistance for economic development activities that address the economic\
  \ needs of individuals and families with low income, through the creation of sustainable\
  \ business development and employment opportunities. CED funds are used for commercial\
  \ developments and equity investments or loans to capitalize a new business or expand\
  \ an existing business, so the businesses can create new, full-time permanent jobs\
  \ for individuals with low incomes. CED allows communities to drive the type of\
  \ investment and/or business to that which is most needed in the community. Seventy-five\
  \ percent of the jobs created must be filled by individuals that are below 200%\
  \ of HHS poverty guideline. In addition to the CED Projects Notice of Funding Opportunity\
  \ (NOFO), CED has published three additional NOFOs that support communities with\
  \ low-income that create business and job opportunities: (1) CED Focus on Social\
  \ Enterprise (CED-SE); (2) CED Focus on Energy Communities (CED-Energy); and (3)\
  \ CED Planning Grant (CED-Planning). All the initiatives have the same objectives\
  \ of the CED program: to create economic mobility opportunities for individuals\
  \ with low-income. The CED-Energy and the CED-Planning awards are aligned with President\
  \ Biden\u2019s Executive Order 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad\
  \ and the Justice40 initiative. The CED-Energy program supports efforts to empower\
  \ workers by revitalizing energy communities. Energy communities are communities\
  \ that have experienced employment loss and/or economic dislocation events because\
  \ of declines in the fossil fuel industry and/or are disproportionately reliant\
  \ on fossil fuel energy production or distribution, including coal, oil, gas, and\
  \ power plant communities across the country. The CED-Planning initiative is to\
  \ stimulate the development of new CED projects through the provision of resources\
  \ that are used to support administrative and capacity building. The RCD program\
  \ provides awards to multistate, regional, and tribal nonprofit organizations that\
  \ provides training and technical assistance to small, rural communities for the\
  \ improvement of drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities. RCD helps community\
  \ members identify and address water and wastewater related issues, including infrastructure\
  \ and accessibility needs; increase access for families with low incomes to water\
  \ supply and waste disposal services; preserve affordable water and waste disposal\
  \ services in low-income rural communities; train water operators to ensure water\
  \ systems comply with federal regulations; increase local capacity and expertise\
  \ to establish and maintain needed water facilities; increase economic opportunities\
  \ for low-income rural communities by ensuring they have basic water and sanitation;\
  \ utilize technical assistance to leverage additional public and private resources;\
  \ promote improved coordination of federal, state, and local agencies and financing\
  \ programs to benefit low-income communities; and help communities establish financial\
  \ stability and financial reserves to maintain water delivery and wastewater disposal\
  \ systems."
