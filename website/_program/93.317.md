objective: The purpose of the Emerging Infections Programs (EIP) is to assist in local,
  state, and national efforts to prevent, control, and monitor the public health impact
  of infectious diseases. The EIP cooperative agreement was formed in 1995 as a key
  component of CDC’s national strategy to address and reduce emerging infectious disease
  (EID) threats.  The EIP is a population-based network of state health agencies and
  their collaborators, including (but not limited to) academic institutions, local
  health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, infection control professionals,
  and healthcare providers.  The network plays a critical role in conducting surveillance
  and applied epidemiologic and laboratory research, implementing and evaluating prevention
  and intervention projects, and responding quickly to new infectious disease issues.  The
  unique strength of the EIP lies in the network’s ability to quickly translate surveillance
  and research activities into informed policy and public health practice.
