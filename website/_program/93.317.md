objective: "The purpose of the Emerging Infections Programs (EIP) is to assist in\
  \ local, state, and national efforts to prevent, control, and monitor the public\
  \ health impact of infectious diseases. The EIP cooperative agreement was formed\
  \ in 1995 as a key component of CDC\u2019s national strategy to address and reduce\
  \ emerging infectious disease (EID) threats.  The EIP is a population-based network\
  \ of state health agencies and their collaborators, including (but not limited to)\
  \ academic institutions, local health departments, public health and clinical laboratories,\
  \ infection control professionals, and healthcare providers.  The network plays\
  \ a critical role in conducting surveillance and applied epidemiologic and laboratory\
  \ research, implementing and evaluating prevention and intervention projects, and\
  \ responding quickly to new infectious disease issues.  The unique strength of the\
  \ EIP lies in the network\u2019s ability to quickly translate surveillance and research\
  \ activities into informed policy and public health practice."
