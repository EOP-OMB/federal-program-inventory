objective: 'Agricultural producers who have coverage under most crop insurance policies
  are eligible for a premium benefit from USDA if they planted cover crops during
  this crop year. The Pandemic Cover Crop Program, offered by USDA’s Risk Management
  Agency (RMA), reduces producers’ overall premium bills and helps them maintain their
  cover crop systems.


  Cultivating cover crops requires a sustained, long-term investment, and the economic
  challenges of the pandemic make it financially challenging for many producers to
  maintain cover crop systems. PCCP helps ensure producers can continue this important
  conservation practice'
