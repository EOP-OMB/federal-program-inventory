objective: "Agricultural producers who have coverage under most crop insurance policies\
  \ are eligible for a premium benefit from USDA if they planted cover crops during\
  \ this crop year. The Pandemic Cover Crop Program, offered by USDA\u2019s Risk Management\
  \ Agency (RMA), reduces producers\u2019 overall premium bills and helps them maintain\
  \ their cover crop systems.\n\nCultivating cover crops requires a sustained, long-term\
  \ investment, and the economic challenges of the pandemic make it financially challenging\
  \ for many producers to maintain cover crop systems. PCCP helps ensure producers\
  \ can continue this important conservation practice"
