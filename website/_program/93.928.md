objective: To quickly respond to the care and treatment needs of individuals receiving
  assistance under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP). The RWHAP Special Projects
  of National Significance (SPNS) supports the development and implementation of innovative
  delivery models of HIV care, services, and capacity development initiatives, including
  the dissemination of strategies and tools for implementation by RWHAP recipients
  and other HIV care and treatment providers. Further, RWHAP SPNS evaluates the effectiveness
  of these models, and promotes the replication of successful models. Areas of evaluation
  include design, implementation, utilization, cost, and health related outcomes of
  effective models. The RWHAP SPNS Program also supports special programs initiatives
  to develop or enhance health information and technology and data systems to enable
  RWHAP recipients and their sub-recipients or providers to report and utilize client-level
  data.

- description: "In FY2022, HRSA continued funding for the Enhancing Linkage of STI\
    \ and HIV Surveillance Data in the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to improve linkage,\
    \ re-engagement in care, and health outcomes for people with HIV. The recipient\
    \ identified and provided technical assistance to four jurisdictions to enhance\
    \ data sharing across their sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV surveillance\
    \ systems to improve the capacity of RWHAP clinics to prioritize resources for\
    \ linking and re-engaging PLWH into care.  In addition, the recipient developed\
    \ toolkits that can be used to guide future implementation of similar projects\
    \ \n\nThe Using Evidence-Informed Interventions to Improve Outcomes among People\
    \ Living with HIV (2iS) was funded in FY 2021 to facilitate the rapid implementation\
    \ and evaluation of six (6) innovative intervention strategies to better understand\
    \ whether these strategies can improve outcomes for clients in four (4) focus\
    \ areas in RWHAP settings.  Twenty geographically dispersed implementation sites\
    \ have been selected and funded to focus on the four following areas:  Justice-involved\
    \ individuals, LGBTQ+ Youth, Substance Use Disorder and Telehealth."
