objective: To quickly respond to the care and treatment needs of individuals receiving
  assistance under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP). The RWHAP Special Projects
  of National Significance (SPNS) supports the development and implementation of innovative
  delivery models of HIV care, services, and capacity development initiatives, including
  the dissemination of strategies and tools for implementation by RWHAP recipients
  and other HIV care and treatment providers. Further, RWHAP SPNS evaluates the effectiveness
  of these models, and promotes the replication of successful models. Areas of evaluation
  include design, implementation, utilization, cost, and health related outcomes of
  effective models. The RWHAP SPNS Program also supports special programs initiatives
  to develop or enhance health information and technology and data systems to enable
  RWHAP recipients and their sub-recipients or providers to report and utilize client-level
  data.
