objective: To quickly respond to the care and treatment needs of individuals receiving
  assistance under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP). The RWHAP Part F Special
  Projects of National Significance (SPNS) supports the development and implementation
  of innovative delivery models of HIV care, services, and capacity development initiatives,
  including the dissemination of strategies and tools for implementation by RWHAP
  recipients and other HIV care and treatment providers. Further, RWHAP Part F SPNS
  evaluates the effectiveness of these models, and promotes the replication of successful
  models. Areas of evaluation include design, implementation, utilization, cost, and
  health related outcomes of effective models. The RWHAP Part F SPNS Program also
  supports initiatives to develop or enhance health information and technology and
  data systems to enable RWHAP recipients and their sub-recipients or providers to
  report and utilize client-level data.
