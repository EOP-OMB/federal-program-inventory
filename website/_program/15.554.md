  \ (CWMP) provides funding to grassroots, local watershed groups to encourage diverse\
  \ stakeholders to develop collaborative solutions to address their water management\
  \ needs. A watershed group is a self-sustaining, non-regulatory group that is composed\
  \ of a diverse array of stakeholders, which may include, but is not limited to,\
  \ private property owners, non-profit organizations, Federal, state, or local agencies,\
  \ and tribes. Funding is provided for the support of watershed groups on a competitive\
  \ basis for the development of watershed groups, watershed restoration planning,\
  \ watershed management project design, and the implementation of on-the-ground watershed\
  \ management projects."
