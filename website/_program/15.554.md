objective: Reclamationâ€™s WaterSMART Cooperative Watershed Management Program (CWMP)
  provides funding to grassroots, local watershed groups to encourage diverse stakeholders
  to develop collaborative solutions to address their water management needs. A watershed
  group is a self-sustaining, non-regulatory group that is composed of a diverse array
  of stakeholders, which may include, but is not limited to, private property owners,
  non-profit organizations, Federal, state, or local agencies, and tribes. Funding
  is provided for the support of watershed groups on a competitive basis for the development
  of watershed groups, watershed restoration planning, watershed management project
  design, and the implementation of on-the-ground watershed management projects.
