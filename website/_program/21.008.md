objective: Specifically, under this expansion, a qualified organization may receive
  a grant for the following activities of (1) referring low-income taxpayers in a
  controversy with the IRS to a qualified representative instead of providing controversy
  representation directly to those taxpayers; or (2) operating a pilot program to
  inform ESL taxpayers about their taxpayer rights and responsibilities without also
  providing controversy representation. Thus, a qualified organization is one that
  (1) ensures low-income taxpayers have access to representation (either by providing
  the representation directly or providing it indirectly with a referral to a qualified
  representative) in controversies with the IRS, or that (2) provides ESL taxpayers
  education about their taxpayer rights and responsibilities. Although a qualified
  organization is no longer required to provide both representation and education
  services, organizations are still encouraged to provide both services, if their
  resources allow.  A qualified organization must not charge more than a nominal fee
  for its services (except for reimbursement of actual costs incurred).
