- description: PHMSA offers UNGS Grants which are designed to support state inspection
    and enforcement of applicable UNGS regulations.  Outreach to states with existing
    UNGS facilities began in CY 2017 with the adoption of UNGS regulations in Title
    49 CFR Part 192.  UNGS program participation (which requires a certification or
    agreement with PHMSA to enforce federal UNGS safety regulations) has increased
    from 4 states in 2018 to 14 states in 2023, out of an estimated 24 potentially
    eligible states with intrastate UNGS facilities.  Of the 14 states participating,
    13 have chosen to apply for grant funding; the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission
    has chosen to participate but not request grant funding.
