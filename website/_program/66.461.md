objective: 'To assist state, territory, tribal, and/or local government  agencies
  in building programs which protect, manage, and restore wetlands. The primary focus
  of the grants is to build state, territory, and tribal wetland programs. A secondary
  focus is to build local (e.g., county or municipal) programs.  Under the Regional
  Wetland Program Development Grant (WPDG) competition, EPA has identified the following
  four Core Elements for improving state/Tribe/territory/local governments''  ability
  to protect and restore their wetlands: (1) Monitoring and Assessment; (2) Voluntary
  Restoration and Protection; (3) Regulatory Approaches Including CWA 401 Certification;
  and (4) Wetland-Specific Water Quality Standards. EPA will include a website in
  each Regional Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) where potential applicants can
  find a list of actions and activities under each Core Element that will develop
  or refine a state, Tribal, territory, or local governmentâ€™s wetlands program. In
  addition, two National Priorities will be included for projects relating to climate
  change and the Justice 40 Initiative. EPA has identified two funding Tracks. Track
  One is for states, Tribes and territories that propose to develop a Wetlands Program
  Plan (WPP) as described at https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/developing-state-or-tribal-wetland-program-plan
  or carrying out projects from an EPA-approved WPP. WPPs can be found on-line at
  https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/state-and-tribal-wetland-program-plans#r1. Track Two
  is for states, Tribes, territories, local governments, interstate agencies, intertribal
  consortia, and universities that are agencies of a state that submit proposals that
  are consistent with the Four Core Elements as described above. Regions may add additional
  Region specific priorities that are compatible and consistent with the core element(s)
  and action(s) in the Appendix of development and refinement actions found at https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-03/documents/wpdg_cef_appendix.pdf.
  Under the National Tribal competition EPA has identified the following four Core
  Elements for improving a Tribe''s ability to protect and restore their wetlands:
  (1) Monitoring and Assessment; (2) Voluntary Restoration and Protection; (3) Regulatory
  Approaches Including CWA 401 Certification; and (4) Wetland-Specific Water Quality
  Standards. EPA will include a website in the National Tribal NOFO where potential
  applicants can find a list of actions and activities under each Core Element that
  will develop or refine a Tribe''s wetlands program. In addition two National Priorities
  will be included for projects relating to climate change and the Justice40 Initiative.
  EPA has identified two funding Tracks. Track One is for tribes that propose to develop
