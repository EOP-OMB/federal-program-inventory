objective: 'This funding will support existing Maternal Mortality Review Committees
  to identify and characterize maternal deaths for identifying prevention opportunities.
  Awardees will identify pregnancy-associated deaths within one year of death; abstract
  and enter clinical and non-clinical data into a standard data system [Maternal Mortality
  Review Information Application (MMRIA)], conduct multidisciplinary reviews, and
  enter committee decisions in MMRIA within 2 years of death. Quality assurance processes,
  in partnership with CDC, will be used for improving data quality, completeness,
  and timeliness. Awardees will analyze data and share findings with stakeholders
  to inform policy and prevention strategies to reduce maternal deaths.
