objective: Supplemental Dairy Margin Coverage (Supplemental DMC) is a program enhancement
  to Dairy Margin Coverage which allows small and mid-size dairy operations the opportunity
  to establish a supplemental production history in addition to an already established
  production history.  By increasing the dairy operations production history through
  supplemental, will allow the dairy operation to cover a higher percentage of their
  milk production and marketing risks. DMC offers a protection plan which provides
  payments to dairy operations when the difference between the all-milk price and
  the average feed cost fall below a certain, producer selected, dollar amount. Producers
  will be eligible for a basic level of margin protection for a small administrative
  fee and be able to purchase higher coverage with a fee.
