objective: "ANEW: The ANEW Program supports innovative academic-practice partnerships\
  \ to prepare advanced practice registered nursing students to practice in rural\
  \ and underserved settings through academic and clinical training. The partnerships\
  \ support enhanced didactic and clinical training opportunities in primary care\
  \ for nursing students (including longitudinal clinical immersive training experiences),\
  \ training for clinical preceptors, traineeships, and support for post-graduate\
  \ employment in primary care, with a particular focus on rural and underserved populations.\
  \ \nANE-SANE: The purpose of the ANE-SANE program is to fund advanced nursing education\
  \ to train and certify Registered Nurses (RNs), Advanced Practice Registered Nurses\
  \ (APRNs), and Forensic Nurses (FNs) to practice as sexual assault nurse examiners\
  \ (SANEs). The program aims to increase the supply and distribution of qualified\
  \ working SANEs and expand access to sexual assault forensic examinations. By expanding\
  \ access to SANEs, the ANE-SANE program aims to provide better physical and mental\
  \ health care for survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence, leading to\
  \ better evidence collection and potentially higher prosecution rates. \nANE-NPR:\
  \ The purpose of this program is to prepare new nurse practitioners (NPs) in primary\
  \ care for practice in community-based settings through clinical and academic focused\
  \ 12-month Nurse Practitioner Residency (NPR) programs, with a preference for those\
  \ projects that benefit rural or underserved populations. The ANE-NPR Program seeks\
  \ to increase primary care providers in community-based settings. This program has\
  \ been structured in a way so that training programs are encouraged to support the\
  \ placement of participants in rural and underserved settings and also find ways\
  \ to assist NPR completers to remain in these settings. \nANE-NPRIP: The purpose\
  \ of this grant program is to prepare new NPs for primary care or behavioral health\
  \ practice in integrated, community-based settings, through expansions and/or enhancements\
  \ to existing 12-month NPR programs. The ANE-NPRIP seeks to increase the number\
  \ of new primary care or behavioral health NPs serving in integrated, community-based\
  \ settings.\n\nANE-NPRF:  The purpose of this program is to prepare new Advanced\
  \ Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) to effectively provide primary care by supporting\
  \ the establishment, expansion and/or enhancement of existing community-based Nurse\
  \ Practitioner (NP) residency and fellowship training programs that are accredited\
  \ or in the accreditation process. The program also focuses on the integration of\
  \ behavioral health and/or maternal health into primary care by training new primary\
  \ care providers (adult, family, adult gerontology, pediatric and women\u2019s health\
  \ NPs), behavioral health providers (psychiatric/mental health NPs) and/or Certified\
  \ Nurse Midwives (CNMs) to transition from education completion to practice, in\
  \ community-based settings. The applicant must train these postgraduate APRNs who\
  \ will serve in primary care settings with a focus on improving access to quality\
  \ healthcare for rural, urban, and tribal underserved populations. \n\n \n\nMatCare:\
  \ The purpose of the MatCare Program is to support accredited nurse midwifery programs\
  \ to train nurse midwives through trainee scholarships, stipends, curriculum enhancement,\
  \ and community-based training. The program seeks to grow and diversify the maternal\
  \ and perinatal health nursing workforce through support for education and training\
  \ in rural and underserved communities."

results:
- description: "ANEW: In Academic Year 2021-2022, awardees of the ANEW Program trained\
    \ 3,964 nursing students, more than one half of whom were underrepresented minorities\
    \ and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds (53%). The ANEW program produced 1,468\
    \ graduates who were ready to enter the health care workforce. Of the 1,468 students\
    \ who were directly funded by ANEW, the majority trained in primary care settings\
    \ (77%), in medically underserved communities (75%), and/or in a setting that\
    \ offered telehealth (62%). To provide clinical training experiences to nursing\
    \ students, grantees partnered with 2,017 clinical training sites in primary care\
    \ settings (70%), medically underserved communities (71%), and/or rural areas\
    \ (32%). For individuals for whom one year post graduation data was available,\
    \ over half were pursuing additional training in a medically underserved community\
    \ (71%). In addition, 74% of the recently graduated individuals were working in\
    \ a primary care setting. ANEW awardees offered developed or enhanced 874 courses\
    \ for trainees, provided 168 continuing education courses to practicing professionals,\
    \ and offered 34 faculty and preceptor development programs. In FY 23, the ANEW\
    \ program was re-competed, and HRSA intends to make awards to 56 applicants. \
    \ \n\nANE-SANE: In Academic Year 2021-2022, awardees from the ANE-SANE program\
    \ trained 2,930 students and produced 580 graduates. The majority of trainees\
    \ were from a rural and/or disadvantaged background (68%). Over 30% of SANE trainees\
    \ received their training in medically underserved communities and about 22% of\
    \ these trainees received training in rural areas . Twenty- seven percent of students\
    \ participated in health equity training and approximately 21% participated in\
    \ COVID-19 related training. The ANE-SANE awardees partnered with  214 clinical\
    \ training sites in primary care settings (16%), medically underserved communities\
    \ (71%), and/or rural areas (34%). More than 90% of the sites provided services\
    \ to victims of interpersonal violence, abuse, or trauma. SANE awardees developed\
    \ and/or enhanced 170  courses. Over 25% of the 580 graduates are currently employed\
    \ in Medically Underserved Community, 6% employed in Primary Care Settings, and\
    \ 11% employed in Rural Areas. In FY 2022, ANE-SANE received additional funding\
    \ to fund 8 additional applicants, bringing the total number of awardees to 28.\
    \ In FY23, ANE-SANE awarded continued funding to 28 awardees. \n\nANE-NPR: In\
    \ Academic Year 2021-2022, the ANE-NPR program trained 383 nurse practitioner\
    \ (NP) residents and graduated 197 NP residents. Most of the NP residents received\
    \ training in medically underserved communities and/or a primary care setting\
    \ (96%), while others received training in a rural setting (38%). A majority of\
    \ the NP residents participated in trainings related to COVID-19 (97%), Health\
    \ Equity/Social Determinants of Health (93%), substance  use treatment (93%) and/or\
    \ trained in a setting that offered telehealth (92%) and had behavioral health\
    \ integrated in primary care (91%). Sixty-five percent of AY 2021-2022 graduates\
    \ were employed in a primary care setting, 63% were employed in a medically underserved\
    \ community, 34% were employed in a rural area, and 43% in FQHCs or look-alikes.\
    \ In FY 2022, ANE-NPR received additional funding to supplement the FY22 funding\
    \ to bring the 36 awardees closer to their FY22 requested funded level. The ANE-NPR\
    \ program will close in 2023. \n\nANE-NPRIP: In Academic Year 2021-2022, the ANE-NPRIP\
    \ Program trained 104 NP residents, 24% of whom were from underrepresented minority\
    \ and/or disadvantaged backgrounds. One hundred percent of the NP residents received\
    \ training in primary care settings and medically underserved communities, and\
    \ 31% received training in rural settings. All NP residents participated in trainings\
    \ related to COVID-19, health equity, behavioral health integration in primary\
    \ care and trained in a setting that offer telehealth. In FY 2022, additional\
    \ funding was received to make supplemental funding awards to the 10 ANE-NPRIP\
    \ awardees to establish/expand/maintain optional community-based nurse practitioner\
    \ fellowship programs (ANE-NPRIP projects), with a preference for those in FQHCs,\
    \ for practicing postgraduate nurse practitioners in primary/behavioral health.\
    \ The ANE-NPRIP program will close in 2023. \n\nANE-NPRF: In FY 2023, HRSA combined\
    \ the current Advanced Nursing Education Nurse Practitioner Residency Program\
    \ (ANE-NPR) and Advanced Nursing Education Nurse Practitioner Residency Integration\
    \ Program (ANE-NPRIP) into one program, the Advanced Nursing Education Nurse Practitioner\
    \ Residency and Fellowship (ANE-NPRF) Program. In FY 23 HRSA intends to make 45\
    \ new awards for the ANE-NPRF Program. \n\nMatCare: For FY 23, HRSA estimates\
    \ approximately $8,000,000 to be available annually to fund approximately 8 award\
