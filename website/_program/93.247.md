objective: "ANEW: The ANEW Program supports innovative academic-practice partnerships\
  \ to prepare advanced practice registered nursing students to practice in rural\
  \ and underserved settings through academic and clinical training. The partnerships\
  \ support enhanced didactic and clinical training opportunities in primary care\
  \ for nursing students (including longitudinal clinical immersive training experiences),\
  \ training for clinical preceptors, traineeships, and support for post-graduate\
  \ employment in primary care, with a particular focus on rural and underserved populations.\
  \ \nANE-SANE: The purpose of the ANE-SANE program is to fund advanced nursing education\
  \ to train and certify Registered Nurses (RNs), Advanced Practice Registered Nurses\
  \ (APRNs), and Forensic Nurses (FNs) to practice as sexual assault nurse examiners\
  \ (SANEs). The program aims to increase the supply and distribution of qualified\
  \ working SANEs and expand access to sexual assault forensic examinations. By expanding\
  \ access to SANEs, the ANE-SANE program aims to provide better physical and mental\
  \ health care for survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence, leading to\
  \ better evidence collection and potentially higher prosecution rates. \nANE-NPR:\
  \ The purpose of this program is to prepare new nurse practitioners (NPs) in primary\
  \ care for practice in community-based settings through clinical and academic focused\
  \ 12-month Nurse Practitioner Residency (NPR) programs, with a preference for those\
  \ projects that benefit rural or underserved populations. The ANE-NPR Program seeks\
  \ to increase primary care providers in community-based settings. This program has\
  \ been structured in a way so that training programs are encouraged to support the\
  \ placement of participants in rural and underserved settings and also find ways\
  \ to assist NPR completers to remain in these settings. \nANE-NPRIP: The purpose\
  \ of this grant program is to prepare new NPs for primary care or behavioral health\
  \ practice in integrated, community-based settings, through expansions and/or enhancements\
  \ to existing 12-month NPR programs. The ANE-NPRIP seeks to increase the number\
  \ of new primary care or behavioral health NPs serving in integrated, community-based\
  \ settings.\n\nANE-NPRF:  The purpose of this program is to prepare new Advanced\
  \ Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) to effectively provide primary care by supporting\
  \ the establishment, expansion and/or enhancement of existing community-based Nurse\
  \ Practitioner (NP) residency and fellowship training programs that are accredited\
  \ or in the accreditation process. The program also focuses on the integration of\
  \ behavioral health and/or maternal health into primary care by training new primary\
  \ care providers (adult, family, adult gerontology, pediatric and women\u2019s health\
  \ NPs), behavioral health providers (psychiatric/mental health NPs) and/or Certified\
  \ Nurse Midwives (CNMs) to transition from education completion to practice, in\
  \ community-based settings. The applicant must train these postgraduate APRNs who\
  \ will serve in primary care settings with a focus on improving access to quality\
  \ healthcare for rural, urban, and tribal underserved populations. \n\n \n\nMatCare:\
  \ The purpose of the MatCare Program is to support accredited nurse midwifery programs\
  \ to train nurse midwives through trainee scholarships, stipends, curriculum enhancement,\
  \ and community-based training. The program seeks to grow and diversify the maternal\
  \ and perinatal health nursing workforce through support for education and training\
  \ in rural and underserved communities."
