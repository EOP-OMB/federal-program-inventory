objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. In contrast, current
  law allows up to $5,000 of employerprovided child care to be excluded from an employee’s
  gross income even though the employer’s costs for the child care are a deductible
  business expense.
