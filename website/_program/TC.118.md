objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities.
  In contrast, taxpayers can receive a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses
  under current law. Taxpayers may also exclude qualified adoption expenses provided
  or reimbursed by an employer from income, subject to the same maximum amounts and
  phaseout as the credit. The same expenses cannot qualify for tax benefits under
  both programs; however, a taxpayer may use the benefits of the exclusion and the
  tax credit for different expenses.
