- description: "•\tPost-Conviction Claims of Innocence Review funds have led directly\
    \ or indirectly to the exoneration of 25 innocent people who were wrongly convicted.\
    \  More than 20 actual perpetrators have been identified. \n•\tThis funding has\
    \ greatly increased grantees’ ability to screen and investigate claims of innocence\
    \ more effectively and quickly, eliminating or reducing case backlogs that were\
    \ often significant. \n•\tIncreased staff support allowed grantees to recruit\
    \ and supervise more law students and volunteer lawyers to assist in case screening,\
    \ investigation, and litigation, thereby multiplying the impact of the grant funds.\
    \ \n•\tGrantees have been able to pursue potential cases of wrongful conviction\
    \ in many remote and rural jurisdictions that have historically been underserved\
    \ by innocence efforts."
