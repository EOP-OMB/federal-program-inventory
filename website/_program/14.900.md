  governments to identify and control lead-based paint hazards in privately-owned
  housing that is owned by or rented to low- or very-low income families.  Specific
  objectives include:  (1) Maximize the combination of children less than six years
  of age protected from lead poisoning and housing units where lead-hazards are controlled;
  (2) Prevent childhood lead poisoning; (3) Stimulate lower-cost and cost-effective
  methods and approaches to lead hazard control work that can be replicated; (4) Build
  local capacity to safely and effectively address lead hazards during lead hazard
  control, renovation, remodeling, and maintenance activities by integrating lead
  safe work practices into housing maintenance, repair, weatherization, rehabilitation
  and other programs that will continue beyond the grant period; (5) Affirmatively
  further fair housing and environmental justice (6) Develop a comprehensive community
  approach to address lead hazards in housing by mobilizing public and private resources,
  involving cooperation among all levels of government, the private sector, and grassroots
  community-based nonprofit organizations, including faith-based organizations, to
  develop cost-effective methods for identifying and controlling lead-based paint
  hazards (7) Establish a public registry of lead-safe housing; and (8)To the greatest
  extent feasible, promote job training, employment, and other economic opportunities
  for low-income and minority residents and businesses that are owned by and/or employ
  minorities and low-income persons as defined in 24 CFR section 75.5.'
