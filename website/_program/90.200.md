objective: The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) is a federal-state partnership serving
  a 240-county/parish area in an eight-state region. Led by a Federal Co-Chairman
  and the governors of each participating state, the DRA is designed to remedy severe
  and chronic economic distress by stimulating economic development and fostering
  partnerships that will have a positive impact on the region's economy. Help economically
  distressed communities to leverage other federal and state programs which are focused
  on basic infrastructure development, transportation improvements, business development,
  and job training services.
