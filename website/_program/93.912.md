objective: 'The Delta Region Community Health Systems Development Program aims to
  enhance health care delivery in the Delta Region through intensive technical assistance
  to providers in select rural communities, including Critical Access Hospitals, small
  rural hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, and other healthcare organizations. The Delta
  States Rural Development Network Program funds organizations located in the eight
  Delta States, which include Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana,
  Mississippi and Missouri. Awardees in these areas aim to promote population health,
  through the planning, implementation, and the development of integrated health care
  networks. In addition, eligible entities participate in the networks to achieve
  efficiencies, expand access to care, as well as to coordinate, and improve the quality
  of essential health care services. The Delta Region Rural Health Workforce Training
  Program aims to address the ongoing need in healthcare facilities for trained administrative
  support or business operations professionals in rural communities through the development
  of Strategic Networks that support recruitment, formal training, certification,
  and placement of students. The Delta Health Systems Implementation Program aims
  to improve healthcare delivery in rural areas by implementing projects that will
  improve the financial sustainability of hospitals and allow for increased access
  to care in rural communities. The Rural Health Network Development Program aims
  to support integrated rural health care networks that have combined the functions
  of the entities participating in the network in order to address the health care
  needs of the targeted rural community. Awardees will combine the functions of the
  entities participating in the network to address the following statutory charges:
  (i) achieve efficiencies; (ii) expand access, coordinate, and improve the quality
  of essential health care services; and (iii) strengthen the rural health care system
  as a whole. The Rural Health Network Development Planning Program assists in the
  development of an integrated rural health care network, specifically for entities
  that do not have a history of formal collaborative efforts. Health care networks
  can be an effective strategy to help smaller rural health care providers and health
  care service organizations align resources and strategies, achieve economies of
  scale and efficiency, and address challenges more effectively as a group than as
  single providers. The Rural Health Care Coordination Program aims to support rural
  health consortiums/networks aiming to achieving the overall goals of improving access,
  delivery, and quality of care through the application of care coordination strategies
  in rural communities. The Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies Program
  aims to improve access to and continuity of maternal and obstetrics care in rural
  communities. Rural Maternal Health Networks develop and test strategies concerning
  rural regional approaches to risk appropriate care, a network approach to coordinating
  a continuum of care, leveraging telehealth and specialty care, and financial sustainability.
  Networks include rural or critical access hospitals, health centers (FQHC), Level
  III (Subspecialty Care) or Level IV (Regional Perinatal Health Care Centers) facilities,
  local social services (such as state Home Visiting and Healthy Start programs),
  and the state Medicaid agency, as partners. The Delta Region Maternal Care Coordination
  Program aims to improve and expand access to and coordination of perinatal health
  care services in the Delta Regional Authority’s Region.  Awardees will use care
  coordination strategies to enhance and expand access to and coordination of perinatal
  services in the Delta Region through a strong network of entities that represent
  the spectrum of care during and after pregnancy. The Rural Health Care Services
  Outreach Program provides support to rural communities to expand and enhance the
  delivery of health care services through a strong consortium of partners. Outreach
  projects utilize evidence-based or promising practice models to implement innovative
  approaches that address community identified health needs, improve population health,
  demonstrate health outcomes and sustainability. For this time, the program also
  includes the Healthy Rural Hometown Initiative (HRHI) to address the underlying
  factors that are driving growing rural health disparities related to the five leading
  causes of avoidable death (heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury/substance
  use disorder, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke).  The Rural Northern
  Border Region Outreach Program promotes the delivery of health care services to
  rural underserved populations in the rural NBRC service area of Maine, New Hampshire,
  New York, and Vermont. The Rural Communities Opioid Response Program – Impact Program
  aims to improve access to treatment and recovery services for substance use disord'
