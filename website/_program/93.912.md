objective: 'Delta Region Community Health Systems Development Program: enhances health
  care delivery in the Delta Region through intensive technical assistance to providers
  in select rural communities, including Critical Access Hospitals, small rural hospitals,
  Rural Health Clinics, and other healthcare organizations. Delta States Rural Development
  Network Program: funds organizations located in the eight Delta States, which include
  Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri.
  It aims to promote population health, through the planning, implementation, and
  the development of integrated health care networks. Eligible entities participate
  in the networks to achieve efficiencies, expand access to care, and coordinate and
  improve the quality of essential health care services. Delta Region Rural Health
  Workforce Training Program: addresses the ongoing need in healthcare facilities
  for trained administrative support or business operations professionals in rural
  communities through the development of Strategic Networks that support recruitment,
  formal training, certification, and placement of students. Delta Health Systems
  Implementation Program: improves healthcare delivery in rural areas by implementing
  projects that will improve the financial sustainability of hospitals and allow for
  increased access to care in rural communities. Rural Health Network Development
  Program: supports integrated rural health care networks that have combined the functions
  of the entities participating in the network to address the health care needs of
  the targeted rural community. Awardees will combine the functions of the entities
  participating in the network to address the following statutory charges: (i) achieve
  efficiencies; (ii) expand access, coordinate, and improve the quality of essential
  health care services; and (iii) strengthen the rural health care system. Rural Health
  Network Development Planning Program: assists in the development of an integrated
  rural health care network, specifically for entities that do not have a history
  of formal collaborative efforts. Health care networks can be an effective strategy
  to help smaller rural health care providers and health care service organizations
  align resources and strategies, achieve economies of scale and efficiency, and address
  challenges more effectively as a group than as single providers. Rural Health Care
  Coordination Program: supports rural health consortiums/networks aiming to achieving
  the overall goals of improving access, delivery, and quality of care through the
  application of care coordination strategies in rural communities. Rural Maternity
  and Obstetrics Management Strategies Program: improves access to and continuity
  of maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities. Rural Maternal Health Networks
  develop and test strategies concerning rural regional approaches to risk appropriate
  care, a network approach to coordinating a continuum of care, leveraging telehealth
  and specialty care, and financial sustainability. Networks include rural or critical
  access hospitals, health centers (FQHC), Level III (Subspecialty Care) or Level
  IV (Regional Perinatal Health Care Centers) facilities, local social services (such
  as state Home Visiting and Healthy Start programs), and the state Medicaid agency,
  as partners. Rural Health Care Services Outreach Program: provides support to rural
  communities to expand and enhance the delivery of health care services through a
  strong consortium of partners. Outreach projects utilize evidence-based or promising
  practice models to implement innovative approaches that address community identified
  health needs, improve population health, demonstrate health outcomes and sustainability.
  The program also includes the Healthy Rural Hometown Initiative (HRHI) to address
  the underlying factors that are driving growing rural health disparities related
  to the five leading causes of avoidable death (heart disease, cancer, unintentional
  injury/substance use disorder, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke). Rural
  Northern Border Region Planning Program: assists in the planning and identifying
  of key rural health issues in the rural Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC)
  service area. The grant program supports planning activities to identify key rural
  health issues, assess rural health challenges, and engage in strategic planning
  activities to inform rural health plans across the northern border region. The goal
  of the program is to help underserved rural communities identify and better address
  their health care needs. Rural Northern Border Region Outreach Program: promotes
  the delivery of health care services to rural underserved populations in the rural
  NBRC service area of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont.  Rural Public
  Health Workforce Training Network Program: expands public health capacity by establishing
  rural health networks to support health care job development, training and placement'
