objective: "The mission of the DoD Legacy Program is to provide coordinated, Department-wide,\
  \ and partnership-based integration of military mission readiness with the conservation\
  \ of irreplaceable natural and cultural resources. \n\n\nThe Secretary of Defense\
  \ established the Legacy Program in 1991 with the mandate to identify, manage, inventory,\
  \ conserve, restore and rehabilitate significant biological, geophysical, cultural,\
  \ and historical resources existing on or involving DOD lands, facilities, and property.\
  \ The Legacy Program funds innovative and coordinated conservation and cultural\
  \ activities of national or regional significance to better support DOD’s ever evolving\
  \ mission, stewardship, and regulatory requirements. \n\nThe Program supports the\
  \ military’s combat readiness mission by ensuring continued access to the nearly\
  \ 27 million acres of DoD land, air, and water resources needed to accomplish vital\
  \ testing, training and operational activities.\n\nPriority project areas that the\
  \ DoD Legacy Program will consider funding are: \n•\tImproving management and conservation\
  \ of biodiversity, particularly focused on DoD “mission priority species,” Recovery\
  \ and Sustainment Partnership efforts, and at-risk Monarch/pollinator species\n\
  •\tImproving consultation and coordination with Indian Tribal Governments and Tribal\
  \ Nations and Native Hawaiian Organizations, and inclusion of Indigenous Knowledge\
  \ in management programs\n•\tImproving cultural resources management processes through\
  \ enhanced environmental resilience, project management, and building energy efficiency.\n\
  •\tImproving techniques and approaches for resilient lands and ecosystem management\n\
  •\tImproving wildland fire management and risk reduction.\n•\tReadiness and range\
  \ sustainment\n*      Climate adaptation, mitigation, and resilience\n•\tIncorporating\
  \ new or emerging technologies\n•\tImproving data and information management\n•\t\
  Regulatory and management efficiencies."
