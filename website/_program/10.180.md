- description: The Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) program promotes the expansion
    of business opportunities for state-inspected meat and poultry establishments.
    Under CIS, state-inspected plants can operate as federally-inspected facilities,
    under specific conditions, and ship their product in interstate commerce and may
    have the opportunity to export them to foreign countries, provided the CIS participating
    State has entered into a supplemental agreement that addresses the export of CIS
    inspected products. No states currently have a supplemental agreement for exporting
    product.
