- description: 'Aviation research grant awarded to University of Oklahoma involving
    the Analysis of Human Behaviours and Strategies for Risk Reduction: Application
    of High Fidelity Virtual Reality Simulation of Real Airports, encompasses developing
    realistic high-fidelity virtual reality scenarios of actual airports and integrating
    the SA, visual scanning, and aircraft control strategies as a function of time.
    The   research is expected to substantially influence FAA, Aviation and Aerospace
    domains, and Human Factors communities through increasing face validity and content
    validity.


    Aviation Research Grant awarded to George Mason University to develop and apply
    finite element modeling and simulation analysis methods for the calibration of
    material models that will be applied in aircraft engine containment and aircraft
    level assessment of uncontained debris analyses.


    Aviation research grant awarded to University of Iowa to explore prototype display
    systems and future sensor technologies to increase safety and operational efficiency
    for helicopters while enhancing the safety case for reduced visibility minima.
    This research will enable helicopters to conduct approaches in low visibility
    conditions in both VMC and IMC weather to VFR helipads. This research will also
    support the development of operational criteria and airworthiness guidance (a
    public purpose) for enabling the use of technology for helicopter operations in
    a high-risk low-altitude environment.'
