objective: "Goal(s):\n\nThe purpose of the Innovative Prosecution Solutions (IPS)\
  \ for Combating Violent Crime Program is to provide state, local, and tribal prosecutors\
  \ with resources to reduce crime and increase public safety.  The program encourages\
  \ prosecutors and agencies to use data in the development of their strategies and\
  \ programs and to develop effective, economical, and innovative responses to crime\
  \ within their jurisdictions.\n\nObjective(s):\n\nIPS programs test data-driven\
  \ approaches that address one or more of the objectives listed below. Successful\
  \ applicants will work closely with BJA staff to assist prosecutorial agencies in\
  \ incorporating innovative or evidence-based prosecution strategies as a fundamental\
  \ component of their effort to ensure public safety. \nRequired Objectives:\n•\t\
  Test, establish, and/or expand programming that enhances prosecutors’ ability to\
  \ effectively and sustainably prevent and respond to crime, especially violent crime,\
  \ which could include the hiring of new prosecutors.\n•\tFoster effective, formalized,\
  \ and consistent collaborations with external agencies, and the communities they\
  \ serve, to increase public safety. \n•\tUse technology, intelligence, and data\
  \ in innovative ways that enable prosecutors’ offices to focus resources on the\
  \ people and places associated with high concentrations of crime and to allow state\
  \ and local prosecutors’ offices to improve their operations in an effort to more\
  \ efficiently and effectively aid communities in achieving a reduction in crime.\n\
  •\tEnable prosecutors’ offices to reduce caseloads to manageable levels through\
  \ office modernization, hiring analytical or support staff, and updating information\
  \ technology.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Number of prosecution personnel hired with\
  \ grant funds; and,\n\nPerformance Measure 2: Number of new prosecution technology\
  \ solutions implemented with grant funds."

    \ Brooklyn Young Adult Justice Initiative \r\n\r\nAs of June 23, the site reports\
    \ 1,781 open cases pending in the Adolescent Diversion Court, which offers diversion\
    \ instead of prosecution for young adults, 16-24 years old, charged with misdemeanor\
    \ offenses, who are at the greatest risk for re-offending and/or are facing more\
    \ serious criminal consequences. \r\n\r\nTwo Assistant District Attorneys joined\
    \ the Bureau since June, bringing the total number of prosecutors in the unit\
    \ up to five.\r\n\r\nSan Diego City Attorney’s Office\r\nPROJECT: The Community\
    \ Justice Initiative (CJI)\r\n\r\nCJI uses data and evidence-based practices to\
    \ restore justice and increase effectiveness and efficiency through a post-plea,\
    \ city-wide diversion initiative to provide accountability, early intervention,\
    \ and swift consequences for participants charged with eligible misdemeanor offenses.\r\
    \n\r\nAs of June 30, the site reports that: 3,943 offers made; 2,650 offers accepted;\
    \ 1,293 offers rejected; 2,048 offers completed; and 423 participants failed out\
    \ of the program. These numbers reflect enrollment since November 2016. The site\
    \ has also completed 224 CJI Proxy Risk Screenings and 61 CJI assessments. \r\n\
    \r\nThe site received its software platform/kiosk for client screening. The kiosks\
    \ will electronically administer the proxy screen to determine high, medium, or\
    \ low risk scores for program participants (a case manager previously conducted\
    \ the risk assessment). The site is working with the courthouse for installation,\
    \ and expects the kiosks to be up and running by September. The site is also building\
    \ new software for the kiosks.\r\n\r\nDistrict of Columbia Office of the Attorney\
    \ General\r\nPROJECT: Using Our Brains: Reducing Recidivism among Youth and Young\
    \ Adults\r\n\r\nThe site is furthering collaboration with the DC US Attorney’s\
    \ Office (USAO). Both offices plan to develop a diversion-based initiative, using\
    \ restorative justice, for youth (ages 12-17) and young adults (ages 18-24) who\
    \ commit certain crimes, such as theft, destruction of property and non-injury\
    \ simple assault cases with victim consent. The team is evaluating USAO data for\
    \ program development. \r\n\r\nThe site hired a restorative justice coordinator\
    \ and two facilitators who will staff their restorative justice panels. The site\
    \ team, partners, and office staff will receive ongoing support and assistance\
    \ for program implementation and restorative justice training from the Baltimore\
    \ Community Conferencing Center. \r\n\r\nJackson County Prosecutor’s Office (Kansas\
    \ City) \r\nPROJECT: Jackson County Prosecutor’s Office Smart Prosecution Initiative\r\
    \n\r\nThe site’s geographic-based initiative targets the “East Zone,” the most\
    \ violent area within Kansas City. Team members will collaborate with law enforcement,\
    \ community partnership specialists, and community members to assess crime-related\
    \ problems in the East Zone and implement strategies to address them.\r\n\r\n\
    A system for hot spot cases has been developed. The site has access to “sophisticated\
    \ mapping software.”\r\n\r\nThe Essex County Prosecutor’s Office (Newark)\r\n\
    PROJECT: Essex County SMART Social Media Initiative \r\n\r\nA specialized unit\
    \ has been developed to investigate and prosecute cases based on suspects’ usage\
    \ of social media. The site envisions a systematic, proactive approach to social-media\
    \ mining that will reduce crime, empower victims, promote fair and impartial justice,\
    \ and instill the public’s confidence in criminal justice.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning\
    \ of the initiative, the team has experienced successful identification hearings\
    \ where witnesses and victims identify defendants without law enforcement involvement.\
    \ The site continues to educate the judges about this process. The site continues\
    \ screening about 3-6 potential cases per week, and reports that most cases have\
    \ social media connections, due to witnesses initially identifying defendants\
    \ through social media.  Since June, the site has 19 confirmed cases in the treatment\
    \ group, and another 50 tentative cases.\r\n\r\nDistrict Attorney of Chatham County\
    \ (Savannah)\r\nPROJECT: The Chatham County Smart Prosecution Program\r\n\r\n\
    The initiative aims to reduce gun, local group, and gang violence by focusing\
    \ on: identifying and targeting a geographic hot spot for gun violence in the\
    \ Savannah area and most violent offenders within it; tracking and prioritizing\
    \ prosecution and individuals within the hot spot; diverting non-essential cases\
    \ (e.g., theft and simple drug possession) to alternative programs; and, engaging\
    \ with community groups within the hot spot through meetings, social media forums,\
    \ and other outreach strategies. As of June 26, there are 19 active cases in the\
    \ target zone area, including both new charges and probation violations.  Total\
    \ cases – including active and disposed cases – have reached 30. The site’s goal\
    \ is to reach 50 active cases soon.\r\n\r\nThe site continues its work with engaging\
    \ community members, by attending neighborhood association meetings. The program\
    \ “End Violence Now” is now housed under the District Attorney’s office; this\
    \ move will promote community engagement and allow team members to work directly\
    \ with the Youth Intercept Program.\r\n\r\nThe site’s researchers at Georgia Southern\
    \ University are developing a process evaluation tool. The researchers are also\
    \ creating one-page briefs on certain topics (such as policing hot spots) that\
    \ can be quickly digested and used by practitioners. The researchers are currently\
    \ focusing on social network analysis and spatial analysis, and have recently\
    \ received data from the Savannah Area Regional Intelligence Center.\r\n"
