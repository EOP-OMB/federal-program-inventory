objective: "Goal(s):\n\nThe purpose of the Innovative Prosecution Solutions (IPS)\
  \ for Combating Violent Crime Program is to provide state, local, and tribal prosecutors\
  \ with resources to reduce crime and increase public safety.  The program encourages\
  \ prosecutors and agencies to use data in the development of their strategies and\
  \ programs and to develop effective, economical, and innovative responses to crime\
  \ within their jurisdictions.\n\nObjective(s):\n\nIPS programs test data-driven\
  \ approaches that address one or more of the objectives listed below. Successful\
  \ applicants will work closely with BJA staff to assist prosecutorial agencies in\
  \ incorporating innovative or evidence-based prosecution strategies as a fundamental\
  \ component of their effort to ensure public safety. \nRequired Objectives:\n\u2022\
  \tTest, establish, and/or expand programming that enhances prosecutors\u2019 ability\
  \ to effectively and sustainably prevent and respond to crime, especially violent\
  \ crime, which could include the hiring of new prosecutors.\n\u2022\tFoster effective,\
  \ formalized, and consistent collaborations with external agencies, and the communities\
  \ they serve, to increase public safety. \n\u2022\tUse technology, intelligence,\
  \ and data in innovative ways that enable prosecutors\u2019 offices to focus resources\
  \ on the people and places associated with high concentrations of crime and to allow\
  \ state and local prosecutors\u2019 offices to improve their operations in an effort\
  \ to more efficiently and effectively aid communities in achieving a reduction in\
  \ crime.\n\u2022\tEnable prosecutors\u2019 offices to reduce caseloads to manageable\
  \ levels through office modernization, hiring analytical or support staff, and updating\
  \ information technology.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Number of prosecution personnel\
  \ hired with grant funds; and,\n\nPerformance Measure 2: Number of new prosecution\
  \ technology solutions implemented with grant funds."
