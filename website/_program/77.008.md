objective: "This Scholarship and Fellowship program provides funding for undergraduate\
  \ scholarships, graduate fellowships, and trade school and community college scholarships.\
  \  In addition, faculty development grants are funded under this authority as explained\
  \ below.  The program allows students to pursue an education in science, engineering,\
  \ or another field of study that the Commission determines is in a critical skill\
  \ area related to its regulatory mission. The trade school and community college\
  \ scholarship program supports certificates or Associate degrees in crafts/disciplines\
  \ necessary for developing and maintaining a nuclear workforce.  \n\nThis activity\
  \ is intended to benefit the nuclear industry broadly. NRC requires scholarship\
  \ and fellowship students to comply with a service obligation agreement for a period\
  \ of 6 months for every year or partial year of support received.   However, the\
  \ NRC has  established criteria for partial or total waiver or suspension of any\
  \ obligation of service or payment incurred by a student.  The employment may be\
  \ with the NRC, other Federal agencies, State agencies, nuclear-related industry,\
  \ or academia in the students\u2019 sponsored fields of study.  Recipients of scholarship\
  \ and fellowships must commit to the service obligation agreement.\n\nThis Scholarship\

  \ and related disciplines as determined by the NRC. The program specifically targets\
  \ probationary, tenure-track faculty in these academic areas.  Lastly, the program\
  \ provides funding to support research and development (R&D) for nuclear science,\
  \ engineering, technology, and related disciplines to develop a workforce capable\
  \ of supporting the design, construction, operation, and regulation of nuclear facilities\
  \ and the safe handling of nuclear materials. University R&D activities provide\
  \ an opportunity to complement current, ongoing NRC-led research."
