objective: "The Natural Resource Stewardship program is the principle means through\
  \ which the National Park Service (NPS) evaluates and improves the health of watersheds,\
  \ landscapes, and marine and coastal resources, sustains biological communities\
  \ on the lands and waters in parks, and actively endeavors to improve the resiliency\
  \ of these natural resources and adapt them to the effects of climate change. \n\
  \ \nNPS conducts natural resource stewardship largely at the park level, utilizing\
  \ park personnel and contractor or cooperative support. To carry out and further\
  \ this stewardship responsibility, the NPS implements programs that encompass a\
  \ broad range of research, operational, and educational activities."
