objective: "The Natural Resource Stewardship program is the principle means through\
  \ which the NPS evaluates and improves the health of watersheds, landscapes, and\
  \ marine and coastal resources, sustains biological communities on the lands and\
  \ waters in parks, and actively endeavors to improve the resiliency of these natural\
  \ resources and adapt them to the effects of climate change. \r\n \r\nThe National\
  \ Park Service (NPS) conducts natural resource stewardship largely at the park level,\
  \ utilizing park personnel and contractor or cooperative support. To carry out and\
  \ further this stewardship responsibility, the Service implements programs that\
  \ encompass a broad range of research, operational, and educational activities."
