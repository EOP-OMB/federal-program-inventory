objective: 'The Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Programs provide funding
  for rural projects through local utility organizations. USDA provides zero-interest
  loans to local utilities which they, in turn, pass through to local businesses (ultimate
  recipients) for projects that will create and retain employment in rural areas.
  The ultimate recipients repay the lending utility directly. The utility then is
  responsible for repayment to USDA.


  USDA provides grants to local utility organizations which use the funding to establish
  Revolving Loan Funds (RLF). Loans are made from the revolving loan funds to projects
  that will create or retain rural jobs. When the revolving loan fund is terminated,
  the grant is repaid to USDA.'
