objective: The Title IV-E Kinship Navigator program helps states, Indian tribes, tribal
  organizations and tribal consortia (tribes) that also operate the title IV-E foster
  care and adoption assistance programs to operate kinship navigator programs.  Kinship
  navigator programs assist kinship caregivers in learning about, finding, and using
  programs and services to meet the needs of the children they are raising and their
  own needs.  They also promote effective partnerships among public and private agencies
  to ensure kinship caregiver families are served.  Title IV-E kinship navigator programs
  must meet grant requirements in section 427(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (the
  Act) and must also be operated in accordance with promising, supported, or well-supported
  practice standards specified in section 471(e)(4)(C) of the Act.  Services are to
  be provided to children and families without regard to childrenâ€™s eligibility for
  title IV-E foster care maintenance payments.
