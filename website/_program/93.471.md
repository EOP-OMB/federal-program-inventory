objective: "The Title IV-E Kinship Navigator program helps states, Indian tribes,\
  \ tribal organizations and tribal consortia (tribes) that also operate the title\
  \ IV-E foster care and adoption assistance programs to operate kinship navigator\
  \ programs.  Kinship navigator programs assist kinship caregivers in learning about,\
  \ finding, and using programs and services to meet the needs of the children they\
  \ are raising and their own needs.  They also promote effective partnerships among\
  \ public and private agencies to ensure kinship caregiver families are served. \
  \ Title IV-E kinship navigator programs must meet grant requirements in section\
  \ 427(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and must also be operated in accordance\
  \ with promising, supported, or well-supported practice standards specified in section\
  \ 471(e)(4)(C) of the Act.  Services are to be provided to children and families\
  \ without regard to children\u2019s eligibility for title IV-E foster care maintenance\
