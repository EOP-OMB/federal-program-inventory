objective: The Rural Capacity Building program enhances the capacity and ability of
  rural housing development organizations, Community Development Corporations (CDCs),
  Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs), local governments, and Indian
  tribes (eligible beneficiaries) to carry out affordable housing and community development
  activities in rural areas for the benefit of low- and moderate-income families and
  persons. The Rural Capacity Building program achieves this by funding National Organizations
  with expertise in rural housing and rural community development who work directly
  to build the capacity of eligible beneficiaries.
