objective: "The purpose of the Clean Water Act Section 121 (33 U.S.C. 1273) Lake Pontchartrain\
  \ Basin Restoration Program (PRP) is to restore the ecological health of the Basin\
  \ by developing and funding restoration projects and related scientific and public\
  \ education projects to reduce the risk of pollution. Funding Priorities \u2013\
  \ Fiscal Year 2023: EPA will invest PRP funds to maintain, protect and restore the\
  \ water quality of the Basin through the following types of activities listed in\
  \ the Comprehensive Management Plan: water quality monitoring to determine the health\
  \ of the watershed, educate basin residents on water protection and pollution prevention,\
  \ implement nonpoint source pollution prevention projects, provide information and\
  \ guidance on habitat protection and green infrastructure techniques, conduct sewer\
  \ system evaluations and surveys, and develop designs and studies to determine infrastructure\
  \ upgrades to prevent or reduce pollution. The public is protected from potential\
  \ water pollution by developing better wastewater and stormwater treatment methods.\
  \ Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 121, the PRP will receive $2,199,000 for\
  \ FY 2023 base appropriations. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\
  \ (IIJA), the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program will receive approximately\
  \ $10,200,000 per year for FY 2022 through FY 2026 through Clean Water Act Section\
  \ 121. The PRP goal for both base and IIJA funding is to significantly improve Lake\
  \ Pontchartrain\u2019s environmental health and climate resilience in an equitable\
  \ manner in communities across the Basin\u2019s watershed. The focus will continue\
  \ to follow the CMP\u2019s recommendations to improve the ecological health of the\
  \ basin through stormwater runoff, agricultural runoff, coastal restoration, habitat\
  \ protection, planning, design, maintenance, education, inflow/infiltration, sewerage,\
  \ research and monitoring."
