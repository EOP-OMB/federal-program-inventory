objective: "The purpose of the Clean Water Act Section 121 (33 U.S.C. 1273) Lake Pontchartrain\
  \ Basin Restoration Program (PRP) is to restore the ecological health of the Basin\
  \ by developing and funding restoration projects and related scientific and public\
  \ education projects. EPA will invest PRP funds to maintain, protect and restore\
  \ the water quality of the Basin through the implementation of the Comprehensive\
  \ Conservation Management Plan (CCMP), formally known as the Comprehensive Management\
  \ Plan. Under the CWA Section 121, the Base program will receive approximately $2.2\
  \ million for Fiscal Year 2025. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\
  \ (IIJA), the Program has received approximately $10.1 million per year in project\
  \ funds for FYs 2022- 2026. Both Base and IIJA funding prioritize the improvement\
  \ of Lake Pontchartrain’s environmental health and climate resilience in an equitable\
  \ manner.  \n\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)-funded Assistance Listings\
  \    \n\nThe Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program considered and integrated\
  \ relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of IIJA and\
  \ M-22-12 “Advancing Effective Stewardship of Taxpayer Resources and Outcomes in\
  \ the Implementation of the Infrastructure Jobs Act.” To achieve the intended goals\
  \ of benefiting disadvantaged communities and building climate change resilience,\
  \ the Program developed an Equity Strategy and guidance documents (including priorities\
  \ from Executive Order 14052: “Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and\
  \ Jobs Act”). EPA will invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor\
  \ stands, ensure goods and services are made in America and build infrastructure\
  \ that is climate change resilient."
