objective: 'The purpose of the Clean Water Act Section 121 (33 U.S.C. 1273) Lake Pontchartrain
  Basin Restoration Program (PRP) is to restore the ecological health of the Basin
  by developing and funding restoration projects and related scientific and public
  education projects to reduce the risk of pollution. Funding Priorities – Fiscal
  Year 2023: EPA will invest PRP funds to maintain, protect and restore the water
  quality of the Basin through the following types of activities listed in the Comprehensive
  Management Plan: water quality monitoring to determine the health of the watershed,
  educate basin residents on water protection and pollution prevention, implement
  nonpoint source pollution prevention projects, provide information and guidance
  on habitat protection and green infrastructure techniques, conduct sewer system
  evaluations and surveys, and develop designs and studies to determine infrastructure
  upgrades to prevent or reduce pollution. The public is protected from potential
  water pollution by developing better wastewater and stormwater treatment methods.
  Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 121, the PRP will receive $2,199,000 for
  FY 2023 base appropriations. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA),
  the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program will receive approximately $10,200,000
  per year for FY 2022 through FY 2026 through Clean Water Act Section 121. The PRP
  goal for both base and IIJA funding is to significantly improve Lake Pontchartrain’s
  environmental health and climate resilience in an equitable manner in communities
  across the Basin’s watershed. The focus will continue to follow the CMP’s recommendations
  to improve the ecological health of the basin through stormwater runoff, agricultural
  runoff, coastal restoration, habitat protection, planning, design, maintenance,
  education, inflow/infiltration, sewerage, research and monitoring.'
