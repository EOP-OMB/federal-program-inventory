objective: The Native American Congressional Internship Program identifies future
  leaders in Indian Country and places them in Congressional and Federal agency offices
  in Washington, D.C. to learn firsthand how the Federal Government works with  and
  impacts Tribes and Tribal communities. The Internship provides professional development
  for up to 12 deserving and qualified students annually, connecting them to a network
  of leaders and policymakers in Indian affairs. The Internship Program is funded
  by a combination of annual appropriations and a permanent trust fund endowment.
  Assistance is intended for the use of Interns only.
