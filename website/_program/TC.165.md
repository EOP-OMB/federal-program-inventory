objective: The baseline tax system would tax Social Security benefits to the extent
  that contributions to Social Security were not previously taxed. Thus, the portion
  of Social Security benefits that is attributable to employer contributions and to
  earnings on employer and employee contributions (and not attributable to employee
  contributions which are taxed at the time of contribution) would be subject to tax.
  In contrast, the Tax Code may not tax all of the Social Security benefits that exceed
  the beneficiary’s contributions from previously taxed income. Actuarially, previously
  taxed contributions generally do not exceed 15 percent of benefits, even for retirees
  receiving the highest levels of benefits. Therefore, up to 85 percent of recipients’
  Social Security and Railroad Social Security Equivalent retirement benefits are
  included in (phased into) the income tax base if the recipient’s provisional income
  exceeds certain base amounts. (Provisional income is equal to other items included
  in adjusted gross income plus foreign or U.S. possession income, tax-exempt interest,
  and one half of Social Security and Railroad Social Security Equivalent retirement
  benefits.) The untaxed portion of the benefits received by taxpayers who are below
  the income amounts at which 85 percent of the benefits are taxable is counted as
  a tax expenditure. Benefits paid to disabled workers and to spouses, dependents,
  and survivors are treated in a similar manner. Railroad Social Security Equivalent
  benefits are treated like Social Security benefits. See also provision number 141,
  Exclusion of railroad (Social Security equivalent) benefits.
