objective: "This program addresses the DHS mission to Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace,\
  \ as defined in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, through efforts to support\
  \ the state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) governments and election infrastructure\
  \ to keep pace in sharing cyber threat information and responding to cyber risk\
  \ in as close to real-time as possible.  This program leverages the strength of\
  \ market technology forces to spur innovative strategies within a Security Operations\
  \ Center (SOC) to enable a cyber-relevant Information Sharing and Analysis Center\
  \ (ISAC) operating model that is consistent with section 2209 of the Homeland Security\
  \ Act, Executive Order 13636, Executive Order 13691, and Presidential Decision Directive-63\
  \ (PDD-63).  Specifically, section 2209(d)(E) requires the composition of the national\
  \ cybersecurity and communications center to include \u201Can entity that collaborates\
  \ with State and local governments on cybersecurity risks and incidents.\u201D This\
  \ program convenes state-of-the-art SOC technology and their cyber analytic expertise\
  \ with SLTT cyber coordinators, cyber and fusion center coordinators, and critical\
  \ SLTT sectors (to include elections, communications, energy etc.) to evolve cyber\
  \ capabilities from mission control to community collaboration models that face\
  \ current threats in the digital battlefront.  Services will allow SLTT  and elections\
  \ infrastructure stakeholders to consume and exchange awareness of threats via technologies\
  \ that serve to derive a more accurate and timelier picture of prioritized cyber\
  \ defense actions, while ensuring coordination is sustained with federal partners\
  \ to defend forward and prevent or thwart malicious cyberspace actors and activities.\
  \ Thus, through these efforts, the program makes improvements in technical cyber\
  \ expertise, provides for a more efficient response and recovery time of systems\
  \ during attack, and develops resilience capabilities for our nation\u2019s SLTT\
  \ government and elections infrastructure sectors.  The program provides a 24x7\
  \ SOC| ISAC that fosters a platform for generating and disseminating cyber threat\
  \ information and coordinating cybersecurity expertise upon which SLTT governments\
  \ and elections entities can rely when making decisions that enable adequate preventative\
  \ and response measures to cyber threats.  By integrating the SLTT and elections\
  \ cyber ecosystems, and empowering insight and cyber situational awareness from\
  \ across the SLTT/elections trusted circle, the community will mutually benefit\
  \ from the innovative measures that protect and improve defenses.\n\nPriorities:\
  \  Successful execution will focus customer relationships on enhanced models for\
  \ threat intelligence exchange.   New technologies in data analytic correlation,\
  \ collaborative threat intelligence and orchestration have created opportunities\
  \ for faster and actionable threat intelligence exchange. The priority in focus\
  \ is to advance SLTT and elections cybersecurity risk management and to help build\
  \ a healthy and resilient SLTT/elections cyber ecosystem via automated collective\
  \ community action."
