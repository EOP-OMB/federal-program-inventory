objective: "The mission of CISA is to lead the national effort to understand and manage\
  \ cyber and physical risk to our critical infrastructure. In carrying out this mission,\
  \ Section 2209 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 assigns the CISA Director the\
  \ responsibilities to, among other things, provide operational technical assistance,\
  \ risk management support, and incident response capabilities to non-federal entities\
  \ with respect to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, cybersecurity risks,\
  \ and incidents; provide information and recommendations on security and resilience\
  \ measures to non-federal entities; and, through an entity that has entered an agreement\
  \ with CISA, collaborate with state and local governments on cybersecurity risks\
  \ and incidents. Section 102 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorizes the\
  \ Secretary to make cooperative agreements in carrying out these responsibilities.\
  \ Pursuant to these authorities, CISA carries out the SLTT SOC | ISAC Program to\
  \ provide cybersecurity services to SLTT governments and their election infrastructure\
  \ to assist them in improving their overall cybersecurity resilience and readiness.\
  \ \nUnder the SLTT SOC | ISAC Program, CISA provides financial assistance through\
  \ a cooperative agreement to for-profit and/or non-profit organizations to operate\
  \ a security operations center | information sharing and analysis center to collaborate\
  \ with SLTT governments and their election infrastructure on cybersecurity threats\
  \ and incidents with the goal of strengthening the SLTT governments’ cybersecurity\
  \ readiness and resilience. The objectives of financial assistance under the SLTT\
  \ SOC | ISAC Program are to: (1) build and improve the capacity for cyber threat\
  \ information sharing among SLTTs and their elections infrastructure and the federal\
  \ government; (2) support SLTTs and their elections infrastructure to build and\
  \ improved the capability to respond to that cyber threat information; and (3) provide\
  \ no-cost cyber managed services to SLTTs and their elections infrastructure. The\
  \ SLTT SOC | ISAC Program supports Goal 3: Secure Cyberspace and Critical Infrastructure\
  \ under the 2020-2024 Department of Homeland Security Strategic Plan and Goal 1\
  \ – Cyber Defense, Goal 2 – Risk Reduction and Resilience, and Goal 3 – Operational\
  \ Collaboration of the CISA Strategic Plan 2023-2025."

    \ expansion to all 56 States and Territories\r\n• Increased membership by 31.5%\r\
    \n• Number of MS-ISAC CERT engagements 169 in 2014, 164 in 2015 and 171 in 2016\
    \ An Engagement is assisting an SLTT with a cyber incident.  This typically may\
    \ include one, or all of the following: log analysis, malware analysis and full\
    \ forensics review of the suspect system (s) and remediation recommendations.\
    \  \r\n• Increased local participation in the NCSR by 103%\r\n• Increased automated\
    \ indicator sharing by 157% (from 33 to 85 entities) This is the number of entities\
    \ that are connected to the automated indicator sharing platform (Soltra Edge)\
    \ which includes DHS.\r\n• Promoting DHS Programs such as NCATS, Cyber Security\
    \ Exercises, Cyber Security Advisors, distribute DHS materials, etc. to the MS-ISAC\
    \ members and conference attendees across the country. \r\n• Increased products\
    \ covered by VMP by 142% (from 7 products to 17)\r\n• Increased threat actor tracking\
    \ by 81% (from 326 to 591 actors) The threat actor tracking enables us to identify\
    \ TTPs which are available to all MS-ISAC analysts. The analysts use this information\
    \ in analyzing and providing assessment of threats and responding attacks impacting\
    \ SLTTs. Threat actor tracking in also used to develop signatures that are deployed\
    \ to Albert devices.  The information is also used in reports provided to members.\
    \ \r\n• Analyzing the use of cloud services for data analysis. The size and scale\
    \ of our Netflow data repository has exceeded our ability to provide timely enterprise\
    \ analysis of the data. A query of all of our Netflow data can take up to a week\
    \ with our current platform. We are analyzing different options to see if a cost\
    \ effect solution can be found. We have meetings/discussions scheduled with US-CERT,\
    \ Carnegie Melon, DARPA, cloud providers and data analysis tool providers to assess\
    \ what the options are. \r\n• Expanded membership partnerships by holding 3 Open\
    \ Houses (7 to 10 members on-site for a 2 day exchange program\r\n• Support State\
    \ ISAO initiatives We have products and tools that would be valuable for the state\
    \ ISAOs that are forming to support critical infrastructure owners and operators\
    \ in their respective states.  One of the first questions by any prospective ISAO\
    \ member is, “how can you help me?”  We can assist with that.  For example, if\
    \ a state provided us with the IPs and domains of its CI partners, we could add\
    \ them to our databases and notify the state ISAO regarding vulnerable domains,\
    \ compromised credentials, connections to sink holes, etc., belonging to their\
    \ ISAO members.  They would also re-distribute all of the DHS and FBI products\
    \ that we currently send to members. This will be a tremendous value add, which\
    \ should encourage CI owners and operators to see the value of joining the state\
    \ ISAO. \r\n"

  year: '2019'
- description: During this period, the MS-ISAC increased in membership by 20%. There
    was an increase in managed cybersecurity service offerings to the Elections Subsector,
    including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capability. The MS-ISAC launched
    the new Malicious Domain Blocking and Reporting (MDBR) managed service offering
    to mitigate threats to the SLTT community, and saw 546 SLTT organizations subscribe.
    During this period, the MS-ISAC added 360 members to the Indicator Sharing Program,
    a 73% increase. Adoption of the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review (NCSR), the cybersecurity
    maturity assessment, increased by over 300%.
  year: '2020'
- description: Actual Accomplishments 2021 - Thus far, the MS-ISAC and EI-ISAC expanded
    MDBR adoption by nearly 4000 enrolled entities as of the end of Oct, 2021, and
    expanded EDR endpoint coverage to 10,172 and extended the vendor contract to provide
    licenses to EI-ISAC members.  This represents a large expansion in managed service
    adoption.  The MS-ISAC adopted a new Threat Intelligence Platform and worked to
    engage SLTTs in indicator sharing and direct access to the platform.  Since implementing
    STIX/TAXII and supporting with automated workflows and Analyst1, the MS-ISAC is
    able to "score" and thus prioritize the sharing of IOCs most relevant to SLTTs.  The
    MS-ISAC ingests 211 total intelligence feeds, with 147 new added YTD, a 230% increase.  1,847
    threat groups are currently tracked, and over 60,000 campaigns with potential
    impact to SLTTs were tracked since October 2020.  Additionally, over 100 presentations
    have been delivered at various SLTT focused events across the U.S.

    \ for the MS/EI-ISAC as of March 2023 is 18,763 which is a 14% higher than March\
    \ 2022. \nThe Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program/Vulnerability Disclosure\
    \ Program (CVD/VDP), which is a formalized process to receive, validate, remediate,\
    \ and communicate vulnerability information on specific technology systems from\
    \ security researchers, will continue to expand and be an efficient way for an\
    \ election organization to improve its security posture. Web Application Firewall\
    \ service, which provides SLTT members protection against HTTP-based inbound attacks\
    \ and Distributed Denial of Service Protection DDOS protection, will continue\
    \ to mature. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration,\
    \ Automation, and Response (SOAR) will continue to improve the efficiency and\
    \ effectiveness of the Security Operations Center (SOC) by enhancing the automation\
    \ and orchestration of tasks and processes, requiring that products and services\
    \ be automation-enabled through use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\
    \ Enhanced Malicious Domain Blocking and Reporting (MDBR+) will provide an additional\
    \ layer of cybersecurity protection through policy-based blocking of DNS activity,\
    \ access to real-time DNS activity, enhanced reporting and portable device protection\
    \ with the use of client software and virtual machines to SLTT members. Development\
    \ of the Critical Infrastructure Baseline Security program will continue."
