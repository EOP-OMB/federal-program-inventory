objective: "This program addresses the DHS mission to Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace,\
  \ as defined in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, through efforts to support\
  \ the state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) governments and election infrastructure\
  \ to keep pace in sharing cyber threat information and responding to cyber risk\
  \ in as close to real-time as possible.  This program leverages the strength of\
  \ market technology forces to spur innovative strategies within a Security Operations\
  \ Center (SOC) to enable a cyber-relevant Information Sharing and Analysis Center\
  \ (ISAC) operating model that is consistent with section 2209 of the Homeland Security\
  \ Act, Executive Order 13636, Executive Order 13691, and Presidential Decision Directive-63\
  \ (PDD-63).  Specifically, section 2209(d)(E) requires the composition of the national\
  \ cybersecurity and communications center to include \u201Can entity that collaborates\
  \ with State and local governments on cybersecurity risks and incidents.\u201D This\
  \ program convenes state-of-the-art SOC technology and their cyber analytic expertise\
  \ with SLTT cyber coordinators, cyber and fusion center coordinators, and critical\
  \ SLTT sectors (to include elections, communications, energy etc.) to evolve cyber\
  \ capabilities from mission control to community collaboration models that face\
  \ current threats in the digital battlefront.  Services will allow SLTT  and elections\
  \ infrastructure stakeholders to consume and exchange awareness of threats via technologies\
  \ that serve to derive a more accurate and timelier picture of prioritized cyber\
  \ defense actions, while ensuring coordination is sustained with federal partners\
  \ to defend forward and prevent or thwart malicious cyberspace actors and activities.\
  \ Thus, through these efforts, the program makes improvements in technical cyber\
  \ expertise, provides for a more efficient response and recovery time of systems\
  \ during attack, and develops resilience capabilities for our nation\u2019s SLTT\
  \ government and elections infrastructure sectors.  The program provides a 24x7\
  \ SOC| ISAC that fosters a platform for generating and disseminating cyber threat\
  \ information and coordinating cybersecurity expertise upon which SLTT governments\
  \ and elections entities can rely when making decisions that enable adequate preventative\
  \ and response measures to cyber threats.  By integrating the SLTT and elections\
  \ cyber ecosystems, and empowering insight and cyber situational awareness from\
  \ across the SLTT/elections trusted circle, the community will mutually benefit\
  \ from the innovative measures that protect and improve defenses.\n\nPriorities:\
  \  Successful execution will focus customer relationships on enhanced models for\
  \ threat intelligence exchange.   New technologies in data analytic correlation,\
  \ collaborative threat intelligence and orchestration have created opportunities\
  \ for faster and actionable threat intelligence exchange. The priority in focus\
  \ is to advance SLTT and elections cybersecurity risk management and to help build\
  \ a healthy and resilient SLTT/elections cyber ecosystem via automated collective\
  \ community action."

- description: "Fiscal Year 2022 (funding awarded September 30, 2022; Program Year\
    \ September 30, 2022 - September 29, 2023) Program Accomplishments: Thus far,\
    \ the MS-ISAC and EI-ISAC have expanded MDBR adoption by 19% to 5118 enrolled\
    \ entities as of the end of March, 2023, and expanded EDR endpoint coverage to\
    \ cover 16,207 so far, a 32 % increase in less than a year's time.  This represents\
    \ a large expansion in managed service adoption. The MS-ISAC expanded the Threat\
    \ Intelligence Platform to 57 organizations.  This year there was record-breaking\
    \ participation by SLTT members in the Nationwide Cyber Security Review (NCSR),\
    \ with 3,681 completed assessments, an increase of 414 from 2022.  The total membership\
    \ for the MS/EI-ISAC as of March 2023 is 18,763 which is a 14% higher than March\
    \ 2022. \nThe Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program/Vulnerability Disclosure\
    \ Program (CVD/VDP), which is a formalized process to receive, validate, remediate,\
    \ and communicate vulnerability information on specific technology systems from\
    \ security researchers, will continue to expand and be an efficient way for an\
    \ election organization to improve its security posture. Web Application Firewall\
    \ service, which provides SLTT members protection against HTTP-based inbound attacks\
    \ and Distributed Denial of Service Protection DDOS protection, will continue\
    \ to mature. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration,\
    \ Automation, and Response (SOAR) will continue to improve the efficiency and\
    \ effectiveness of the Security Operations Center (SOC) by enhancing the automation\
    \ and orchestration of tasks and processes, requiring that products and services\
    \ be automation-enabled through use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\
    \ Enhanced Malicious Domain Blocking and Reporting (MDBR+) will provide an additional\
    \ layer of cybersecurity protection through policy-based blocking of DNS activity,\
    \ access to real-time DNS activity, enhanced reporting and portable device protection\
    \ with the use of client software and virtual machines to SLTT members. Development\
    \ of the Critical Infrastructure Baseline Security program will continue."

- description: 'Fiscal Year 2023 & 2024 (funding awarded near the end of the fiscal
    year) Estimated Program Accomplishments:

    With FY2023 and FY2024 funding, the program plans to expand the use of its existing
    services, streamline the data and reporting effort for NCSR, and continue to engage
    with the ISAC by providing distanced outreach and stakeholder engagement through
    virtual service reviews and remote speaking engagements. Plans to extend EDR services
    and Albert sensors to additional underserved SLTT and elections entities will
    continue. Additionally, the program will update the Albert sensor functionality
    to include preventive capabilities. As always, expansion of the number of MS-ISAC
    and EI-ISAC members will continue.'
