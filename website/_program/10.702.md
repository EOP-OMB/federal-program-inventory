  \ public lands for rural Alaskans.  The program includes maintaining sound management\
  \ principles and conservation of healthy populations of fish and wildlife and other\
  \ renewable resources.\n\nThe continuation of subsistence use occurring on public\
  \ land is essential to Alaska\u2019s Native and non-Native rural residents\u2019\
  \ physical, economic, traditional, cultural, and/or social existence.  No practical\
  \ alternative means are available to replace the food and other resources fish and\
  \ wildlife provide to rural Alaskans.\n\nSubsistence uses is defined in Alaska National\
  \ Interest Lands Conservation Act (PL 96-487), Section 803, to be customary and\
  \ traditional uses by rural Alaska residents of wild, renewable resources for direct\
  \ personal or family consumption as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools or transportation;\
  \ for the making and selling of handicraft articles out of nonedible by-products\
  \ of fish and wildlife resources taken for personal or family consumption; for barter,\
  \ or sharing for personal or family consumption; and for customary trade."
