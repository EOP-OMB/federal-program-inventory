objective: "To support agricultural research at State Agricultural Experiment Stations.\
  \ Its purpose is to promote efficient production, marketing, distribution, and utilization\
  \ of products of the farm as essential to the health and welfare of people and to\
  \ promote a sound prosperous agriculture and rural life. Up to 25 percent (25%)\
  \ of funds to be used for integrated cooperative research and extension activities.\
  \ \r\n\r\nTwo (2) Programs are funded under CFDA 10.203. Specific Objectives are\
  \ as follows:\r\n \r\n(A) The Hatch Act of 1887 (Regular Research) \r\nThe Hatch\
  \ Act of 1887 provides the basis for Federal funding for agricultural research activities\
  \ at the State Agricultural Experiment Stations in the 50 States, the District of\
  \ Columbia, and the Insular Areas.\r\nState Agricultural Experiment Stations are\
  \ eligible for funds appropriated under this Act according to the following formula:\
  \ The previous year\u2019s base plus the current year increase as follows: \r\n\
  Three percent (3%) for Federal Administration, \r\nTwenty percent (20%) equally,\
  \ \r\nTwenty-six percent (26%) in an amount which bears the same ratio to the total\
  \ amount to be allotted as the rural population of the State bears to the total\
  \ rural population of all the States as determined by the last preceding decennial\
  \ census; \r\nTwenty-six percent (26%) t in an amount which bears the same ratio\
  \ to the total amount to be allotted as the farm population of the State bears to\
  \ the total farm population of all the States as determined by the last preceding\
  \ decennial census. Twenty-five percent (25%)  for the Hatch Multistate Research\
  \ Fund.\r\n\r\n(B) The Hatch Act of 1887 (Multistate Research) \r\nNot less than\
  \ twenty-five percent (25%) of the total Hatch Act of 1887 funding is allotted to\
  \ the States for cooperative research employing multidisciplinary approaches in\
  \ which a State agricultural experiment station, working with another State agricultural\
  \ experiment station, the Agricultural Research Service, or a college or university,\
  \ cooperates to solve problems that concern more than one (1) State. These funds\
  \ are designated as the \u2018\u2018Multistate Research Fund, State Agricultural\
  \ Experiment Stations.\u201D Funds are allocated on a prorata basis and allocations\
  \ are adjusted to support national and regional projects. These projects and their\
  \ associated budgets are reviewed and approved annually.\r\n\r\nThe 25 percent applies\
  \ to any amounts appropriated above the level of funding in 1955 (the base year). "
