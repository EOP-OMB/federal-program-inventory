objective: "To assist State Agricultural Experiment Stations, the District of Columbia,\
  \ and the U.S. Insular Areas in conducting agricultural research programs. These\
  \ activities are broad and include research on all aspects of agriculture, including\
  \ soil and water conservation and use; plant and animal production, protection,\
  \ and health; processing, distribution, safety, marketing, and utilization of food\
  \ and agricultural products; forestry, including range management and range products;\
  \ multiple use of forest rangelands, and urban forestry; aquaculture; home economics\
  \ and family life; human nutrition; rural and community development; sustainable\
  \ agriculture; molecular biology; and biotechnology. Research may be conducted on\
  \ problems of local, state, regional, or national concern.\n\nNot less than 25 percent\
  \ of the total Hatch Act of 1887 (7 U.S.C. 361c(c)(3)) funding is allotted to \n\
  the states for cooperative research employing multidisciplinary approaches in which\
  \ a State \nagricultural experiment station, working with another State agricultural\
  \ experiment station, the \nAgricultural Research Service, or a college or university,\
  \ cooperates to solve problems that \nconcern more than one state. These funds are\
  \ designated as the “Multistate Research Fund.” Funds \nare allocated on a pro rata\
  \ basis and allocations are adjusted to support national and regional \nprojects.\
  \ These projects and their associated budgets are reviewed and approved annually."
