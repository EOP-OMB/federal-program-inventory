objective: Division N, Title IV, Section 421 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act,
  2021 (the “Act”), Pub. L. No. 116-260 (December 27, 2020) authorized the $2 billion
  Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS) program to provide
  grants to eligible motorcoach companies, school bus companies, passenger vessel
  companies, and pilotage companies that have experienced annual revenue losses of
  25 percent or more as result of COVID-19 directly or indirectly. The priority use
  of grant funds was required to be for payroll costs, though grants may be used for
  operating expenses and the repayment of debt accrued to maintain payroll.

- description: 'Over 1,400 motorcoach, school bus, passenger vessel, and pilotage
    companies across the United States used grant funds to support jobs, rehire staff,
    and stabilize an industry that experienced significant economic disruptions due
    to the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, grant recipients have spent the majority of
    funds on payroll costs, with the remainder of funds expended on costs such as
    operations, maintenance, and COVID-19 protection. Grantees represented a diverse
    segment of the industry: approximately 23% of recipients were women-owned businesses,
    33% were minority-owned businesses, and 6% were veteran-owned businesses. Approximately
    93% of all grantees were small businesses that supported staff during challenging
    times, while serving customers and communities across the country.'
