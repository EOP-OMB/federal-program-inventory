objective: "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\u2019s objective is to\
  \ ensure motor carriers operating commercial vehicles entering the United States\
  \ from a foreign country are in compliance with commercial vehicle safety standards\
  \ and regulations, financial responsibility regulations and registration requirements\
  \ of the United States, and to ensure drivers of those vehicles are qualified and\
  \ properly licenses to operate the commercial vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe Border Enforcement\
  \ Grant program purpose has been incorporated into the FMCSA Motor Carrier Safety\
  \ Assistance formula grant program and the FMCSA High Priority grant program due\
  \ to changes in FMCSA\u2019s authorization under the Fixing America\u2019s Surface\
  \ Transportation Act (Pub. L. No. \xA7 114-94, \xA7\xA7 5101(a) and 5101(c) (2015),\
  \ 49 U.S.C. \xA7\xA7 31102(a)-(k), 31104 (2016), as amended).  Awards are no longer\
  \ being made under this CFDA; however, pre-existing grants will remain active until\
  \ project completion and/or period of performance on the individual grant agreements\
  \ expires.  For more information on this change, visit FMCSA CFDA number 20.218."
