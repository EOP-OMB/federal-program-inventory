  \ motor carriers operating commercial vehicles entering the United States from a\
  \ foreign country are in compliance with commercial vehicle safety standards and\
  \ regulations, financial responsibility regulations and registration requirements\
  \ of the United States, and to ensure drivers of those vehicles are qualified and\
  \ properly licenses to operate the commercial vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe Border Enforcement\
  \ Grant program purpose has been incorporated into the FMCSA Motor Carrier Safety\
  \ Assistance formula grant program and the FMCSA High Priority grant program due\

  \ pre-existing grants will remain active until project completion and/or period\
  \ of performance on the individual grant agreements expires.  For more information\
  \ on this change, visit FMCSA CFDA number 20.218."
