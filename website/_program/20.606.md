objective: The NDR maintains the computerized database known as the Problem Driver
  Pointer System (PDPS) which contains information on individuals whose privilege
  to operate a motor vehicle has been revoked, suspended, canceled, or denied or who
  have been convicted of serious traffic-related offenses. The purpose of the NDR
  is to assist chief driver licensing officials of participating States in exchanging
  information about the motor vehicle driving records of individuals.  NHTSA is authorized
  by statute to enter into an agreement with an organization that represents the interests
  of the states to provide services to States to manage, administer, and operate the
  NDR’s IT system and user assistance functions.
