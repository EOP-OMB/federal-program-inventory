objective: Community Compass brings together technical assistance funding appropriations
  from across HUD program offices, including the offices of Community Planning and
  Development, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Housing, Public and Indian Housing,
  and Policy Development and Research. This cross-funding approach recognizes that
  HUDâ€™s grantees, subgrantees, and other customers often interact with a variety of
  HUD programs as they deliver housing or community development services.  Community
  Compass allows for holistic technical assistance to address the program and policy
  implementation deficiencies and skill gaps of grantees and subgrantees across multiple
  HUD programs, often within the same engagement.
