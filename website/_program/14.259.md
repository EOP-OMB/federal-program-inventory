objective: "Community Compass brings together technical assistance funding appropriations\
  \ from across HUD program offices, including the offices of Community Planning and\
  \ Development, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Housing, Public and Indian Housing,\
  \ and Policy Development and Research. This cross-funding approach recognizes that\
  \ HUD\u2019s grantees, subgrantees, and other customers often interact with a variety\
  \ of HUD programs as they deliver housing or community development services.  Community\
  \ Compass allows for holistic technical assistance to address the program and policy\
  \ implementation deficiencies and skill gaps of grantees and subgrantees across\
  \ multiple HUD programs, often within the same engagement."
