objective: 'To help the regional economy become more competitive by putting in place
  the building blocks for self-sustaining economic development, while continuing to
  provide special assistance to the Region''s most distressed counties and areas.
  This program focuses on activities which support ARC''s mission to innovate, partner,
  and invest to build community capacity and strengthen economic growth in Appalachia.
  Activities funded must advance ARC''s strategic plan.  Specific program goals are:
  (1) Invest in entrepreneurial and business development strategies that strengthen
  Appalachia''s economy; (2) Increase the education, knowledge, skills, and health
  of residents to work and succeed in Appalachia; (3) Invest in critical infrastructureâ€”especially
  broadband; transportation, including the Appalachian Development Highway System;
  and water/wastewater systems; (4) Strengthen Appalachia''s community and economic
  development potential by leveraging the Region''s natural and cultural heritage
  assets; and (5) Build the capacity and skills of current and next-generation leaders
  and organizations to innovate, collaborate, and advance community and economic development.
  Specific objectives were developed for each goal. Grants are made either directly
  by the Commission or grants may supplement other Federal grants.'
