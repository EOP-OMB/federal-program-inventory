objective: "Mobile Health Training Program (NEPQR-MHTP): The purpose of this program\
  \ is to improve and strengthen health equity in the nursing workforce with education\
  \ and training to provide culturally aligned quality care in rural and underserved\
  \ areas.  The program will encourage recruitment and training of nursing students\
  \ to address and manage social determinants of health (SDOH) and improve health\
  \ equity of vulnerable populations in rural and underserved areas through nurse-led\
  \ mobile health training sites.  The NEPQR-MHTP will create and expand experiential\
  \ learning opportunities for nursing students, including the provision of high-quality\
  \ culturally sensitive care, identification of SDOH in local communities, engagement\
  \ in critical thinking, and clinical practice highlighting a collaborative team\
  \ approach to care. \n\n \n\nNursing Faculty and Preceptor Academies (NEPQR-CFPA)\
  \ Program: The purpose of this program is to increase the nursing workforce by recruiting,\
  \ training and producing skilled qualified clinical nursing faculty and nursing\
  \ preceptors. The program will prepare nurses to serve as nursing clinical faculty\
  \ and preceptors to newly hired or transitioning licensed nurses in a variety of\
  \ care settings.  The NPA program aims to create academies consisting of academic-clinical\
  \ partnerships to develop and implement a formal curriculum to train clinical nursing\
  \ preceptors.  \n\n \n\nRegistered Nurse Training Program (NEPQR-RNTP): The purpose\
  \ of this program is to enhance nursing education and practice to advance the health\
  \ of patients, families, and communities and improve health outcomes through innovative\
  \ interprofessional training programs in acute care settings aimed to address and\
  \ manage social determinant of health factors and improve health equity and health\
  \ literacy in vulnerable populations. \n\n \n\nSimulation Education Training (NEPQR-SET):\
  \ The purpose of the NEPQR-SET program is to enhance nurse education and strengthen\
  \ the nursing workforce by increasing training opportunities for nursing students\
  \ through the use of simulation-based technology, including equipment, to increase\
  \ their readiness to practice upon graduation. This training expands the capacity\
  \ of nurses to advance the health of patients, families, and communities in rural\
  \ or medically underserved areas experiencing diseases and conditions such as stroke,\
  \ heart disease, behavioral health, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, and obesity. \n\
  \n \n\nPathway to Registered Nurse Program (NEPQR-PRNP): The purpose of this program\
  \ is to create a pathway from academic training to clinical practice through the\
  \ creation and implementation of Licensed Practical Nurse/Licensed Vocational Nurse\
  \ (LPN/LVN) to Registered Nurse (RN) Bridge Programs and employment of Clinical\
  \ Nurse Faculty. \n\n \n\nWorkforce Expansion Program (NEPQR-WEP): The purpose of\
  \ the Nurse Education, Practice, Quality, and Retention (NEPQR) - Workforce Expansion\
  \ Program (WEP) is to increase the nursing workforce in rural (non-metro) and underserved\
  \ areas to address the critical shortage of nurses, specifically in acute and long-term\
  \ care settings."
