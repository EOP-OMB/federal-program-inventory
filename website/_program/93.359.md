objective: "Interprofessional Collaborative Practice: Behavioral Health Integration\
  \ (NEPQR-IPCP:BHI) Program: The purpose of this program is to increase the access\
  \ to and quality of behavioral health services through behavioral health integrated\
  \ team-based care models; and train the future nursing workforce to provide integrated\
  \ behavioral health services in primary care settings through academic-practice\
  \ partnerships.\n\nRegistered Nurses in Primary Care (RNPC) Training Program: The\
  \ purpose of this four-year training program is to recruit and train nursing students\
  \ and current registered nurses (RNs) to practice to the full scope of their license\
  \ in community-based primary care teams to increase access to care, with an emphasis\
  \ on chronic disease prevention and control, including mental health and substance\
  \ use conditions. The program aims to achieve a sustainable primary care nursing\
  \ workforce equipped with the competencies necessary to address pressing national\
  \ public health issues, even the distribution of the nursing workforce, improve\
  \ access to care and improve population health outcomes. Veteran Registered Nurses\
  \ in Primary Care (VRNPC) Training Program: The purpose of this three-year training\
  \ program is to recruit and train veteran nursing students and current registered\
  \ nurses (RNs) to practice to the full scope of their license in community-based\
  \ primary care teams to increase access to care, with an emphasis on veteran care,\

  \ workforce equipped with the competencies necessary to address pressing veteran\
  \ public health issues, as well as the distribution of the nursing workforce, improve\
  \ access to care and improve population health outcomes.\n\nMobile Health Training\
  \ Program (NEPQR-MHTP): The purpose of this program is to improve and strengthen\
  \ health equity in the nursing workforce with education and training to provide\
  \ culturally aligned quality care in rural and underserved areas.  The program will\
  \ encourage recruitment and training of nursing students to address and manage social\
  \ determinants of health (SDOH) and improve health equity of vulnerable populations\
  \ in rural and underserved areas through nurse-led mobile health training sites.\
  \  The NEPQR-MHTP will create and expand experiential learning opportunities for\
  \ nursing students, including the provision of high-quality culturally sensitive\
  \ care, identification of SDOH in local communities, engagement in critical thinking,\
  \ and clinical practice highlighting a collaborative team approach to care. \n\n\
  Nursing Faculty and Preceptor Academies (NEPQR-CFPA) Program: The purpose of this\
  \ program is to increase the nursing workforce by recruiting, training and producing\
  \ skilled qualified clinical nursing faculty and nursing preceptors. The program\
  \ will prepare nurses to serve as nursing clinical faculty and preceptors to newly\
  \ hired or transitioning licensed nurses in a variety of care settings.  The NPA\
  \ program aims to create academies consisting of academic-clinical partnerships\
  \ to develop and implement a formal curriculum to train clinical nursing preceptors.\n\

  \ populations.\n\nSimulation Education Training (NEPQR-SET): The purpose of the\
  \ NEPQR-SET program is to enhance nurse education and strengthen the nursing workforce\
  \ by increasing training opportunities for nursing students through the use of simulation-based\
  \ technology, including equipment, to increase their readiness to practice upon\
  \ graduation. This training expands the capacity of nurses to advance the health\
  \ of patients, families, and communities in rural or medically underserved areas\
  \ experiencing diseases and conditions such as stroke, heart disease, behavioral\
  \ health, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, and obesity. \n\nPathway to Registered Nurse\
  \ Program (NEPQR-PRNP): The purpose of this program is to create a pathway from\
  \ academic training to clinical practice through the creation and implementation\
  \ of Licensed Practical Nurse/Licensed Vocational Nurse (LPN/LVN) to Registered\
