objective: "(1) To enhance the capacity to develop, transfer, apply, monitor, and\
  \ regularly update practical science-based forest restoration treatments that will\
  \ reduce the risk of severe wildfires, and improve the health of dry forest and\
  \ woodland ecosystems in the interior West; (2) to synthesize and adapt scientific\
  \ findings from conventional research programs to the implementation of forest and\
  \ woodland restoration on a landscape scale; (3) to facilitate the transfer of interdisciplinary\
  \ knowledge required to understand the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of\
  \ wildfire on ecosystems and landscapes; (4) to require the Institutes established\
  \ under this Act to collaborate with Federal agencies to use ecological restoration\
  \ and wildfire treatments; (5) to assist land managers in restoration-based applications\
  \ and new management technologies; (6) to provide technical assistance to collaborative\
  \ efforts by affected entities; and (7) to assist Federal and non-Federal land managers\
  \ in providing information to the public on the role of fire and fire management.\r\
