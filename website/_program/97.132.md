objective: "The TVTP Grant Program has six objectives:\n•\tThe local community has\
  \ awareness of the signs that someone may be escalating towards violence and of\
  \ the threats of targeted violence and terrorism.\n•\tThe local community has awareness\
  \ of both risk factors for – and protective factors against – escalation to violence.\n\
  •\tMembers of the local community engage the broadest and most diverse set of local\
  \ stakeholders, sharing resources and best practices and building trusted partnerships\
  \ to address targeted violence and terrorism. •Members of the local community can\
  \ act on bystander training and help individuals before they escalate to violence\
  \ by understanding the role of, and the means to contact, threat assessment, and\
  \ management teams.\n•\tMembers of the local community have access to multi-disciplinary\
  \ threat assessment and management teams comprised of individuals such as psychologists,\
  \ educators, faith leaders, and medical personnel that can provide support to an\
  \ individual before an act of violence takes place.\n•\tThe local community has\
  \ programs that address risk factors for, and strengthen protective factors against,\
  \ escalation to violence, including recidivism reduction programming.\nPriorities:\
  \ \nThe TVTP Grant Program has five priorities:\n•\tImplementing Prevention Capabilities\
  \ in Small and Mid-Sized Communities;\n•\tAdvancing Equity in Awards and Engaging\
  \ Underserved Communities in Prevention;\n•\tAddressing Online Aspects of Targeted\
  \ Violence and Terrorism;\n•\tPreventing Domestic Violent Extremism; and\n•\tEnhancing\
  \ Local Threat Assessment and Management Capabilities.\nPerformance Measures:\n\
  Performance Measures for the TVTP program are provided in the TVTPs Notice of Funding\
  \ Opportunity available at grants.gov."

- description: "Accomplishments under the program\nname “Countering Violent Extremism”:\
    \ Data collected in these projects show increases in willingness to intervene,\
    \ increases in knowledge and protective factors, and decreases in risk factors.\
    \ DHS Staff have identified five models for replication based on these positive\
    \ outcomes by grantees including:\n1.\tIntervention Capabilities;\n2.\tRegional\
    \ Prevention Planning and Implementation;\n3.\tLaw Enforcement Training;\n4.\t\
    Law Enforcement Led Youth Resilience Building; and\n5.\tCommunity Led Resilience\
    \ Building.\nOutputs:\nThrough seven quarters grantees reported:\n•\tConducting\
    \ over 700 activities including over 200 training sessions.\n•\tIn person participation\
    \ of approximately 40,000 people, including approximately 2,000 law enforcement\
    \ officers and 2,500 other professionals such as service providers that have an\
    \ exponential prevention value in their communities.\n•\tApproximately 1,300 partnerships\
    \ with other organizations.\n•\tDigitally: Grantee content has garnered 4 million\
    \ impressions, and nearly 2 million engagements (Likes, shares, clicks, etc.).\n\
    Other Outputs\n•\tFour states (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, and Virginia) piloted\
    \ a Roadmap developed to create statewide strategies to prevent targeted violence\n\
    •\tSeven cities are establishing regional resilience frameworks:\n•\tIntervention\
    \ protocols and trainings.\n•\tLocally tailored community threat briefings.\n\
    •\tMobile App for developing viral counter messages.\n•\tTailored training to\
    \ key audiences: Bystander/Gatekeeper training, youth resilience-building curricula,\
    \ toolkits for mental health professionals."

- description: "This funding addressed a gap in our nation’s prevention capabilities:\
    \ \n• Enhancing awareness to the threat of individuals mobilizing or radicalizing\
    \ to violence; \n• Intervening with such individuals; \n• Developing resilience\
    \ or protective factors in communities and with individuals; and \n• Providing\
    \ alternative messages or activities that challenge violent narratives."
  year: '2020'
- description: "The grant has empowered the building of Threat Assessment Management\
    \ teams in Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Washington D.C., the Bay\
    \ Area, Michigan, and the state of Hawaii. Moreover, under the grant, local institutions\
    \ such as hospitals, universities, local non-profits and schools have developed\
    \ TA capabilities to identify and respond to targeted violence and terrorism before\
    \ they occur. For example, grantees coordinate information sharing and meetings\
    \ between various members of the community to not only identify a potential sign\
    \ of radicalization to violence, but also to determine how to best handle the\
    \ case who is best to handle the \ncase. So far 56 cases have been referred to\
    \ the appropriate TA member and 94 cases have been intervened successfully.  \n\
    Furthermore, so far FY 20 and FY 21 grantees have trained more than 5,000 individuals\
    \ on topics such as Targeted Violence: Community Awareness, Behavioral Analysis,\
    \ and Prevention Strategies, media literacy, and youth leadership, among others."
