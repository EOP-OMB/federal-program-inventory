objective: "The TVTP Grant Program has six objectives:\n\u2022\tThe local community\
  \ has awareness of the signs that someone may be escalating towards violence and\
  \ of the threats of targeted violence and terrorism.\n\u2022\tThe local community\
  \ has awareness of both risk factors for \u2013 and protective factors against \u2013\
  \ escalation to violence.\n\u2022\tMembers of the local community engage the broadest\
  \ and most diverse set of local stakeholders, sharing resources and best practices\
  \ and building trusted partnerships to address targeted violence and terrorism.\
  \ \u2022Members of the local community can act on bystander training and help individuals\
  \ before they escalate to violence by understanding the role of, and the means to\
  \ contact, threat assessment, and management teams.\n\u2022\tMembers of the local\
  \ community have access to multi-disciplinary threat assessment and management teams\
  \ comprised of individuals such as psychologists, educators, faith leaders, and\
  \ medical personnel that can provide support to an individual before an act of violence\
  \ takes place.\n\u2022\tThe local community has programs that address risk factors\
  \ for, and strengthen protective factors against, escalation to violence, including\
  \ recidivism reduction programming.\nPriorities: \nThe TVTP Grant Program has five\
  \ priorities:\n\u2022\tImplementing Prevention Capabilities in Small and Mid-Sized\
