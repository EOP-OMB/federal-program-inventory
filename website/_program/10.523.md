objective: "The Centers of Excellence at 1890 Institutions Program will establish\
  \ new federally-funded Centers of Excellence, building on three existing non-federal\
  \ Centers established in 2015 in conjunction with the 125th Anniversary of the Second\
  \ Morrill Act of 1890. Funding will be awarded non-competitively to build capacity\
  \ of the following Centers:\n\n1)\tThe Center for Innovation and Sustainable Small\
  \ Farms, Ranches, and Landowners (CISFRL) is intended to increase profitability,\
  \ natural resource conservation and market demand for small farmers, including socially\
  \ disadvantaged/ underserved farmers, ranchers and forest landowners. This Center\
  \ also addresses challenges related to healthier families and enhanced quality of\
  \ life in rural communities.\n2)\tThe Center of Excellence for International Engagement\
  \ and Development is designed to supply the country with a globally educated workforce\
  \ and support critical global development needs. Projects may address trans-boundary\
  \ challenges including U.S. national security, climate variability, conservation,\
  \ and biodiversity, as well as the development/strengthening of teaching curricula\
  \ and experiential learning.\n3)\tThe Virtual Center to Motivate and Educate for\
  \ Achievement serves as an expansive resource center for developing and sustaining\
  \ a diverse and talented STEAM workforce pipeline by working collaboratively with\
  \ government and private sectors."
