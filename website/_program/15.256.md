objective: "In accordance with Section 404 of SMCRA, lands and water eligible for\
  \ reclamation or drainage abatement under Section 404 of Public Law 95-87 (the Act),\
  \ Stat. 445-532 as amended, are those which were mined for coal or which were affected\
  \ by mining, waste banks, coal processing, or other coal mining processes prior\
  \ to August 3, 1977, and left in an unclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition,\
  \ for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under state or other\
  \ Federal laws. The funding priorities and technical focus for this announcement\
  \ are to use appropriated PTPP funds for the comprehensive abatement and treatment\
  \ of water pollution discharged from abandoned mine lands to restore water quality\
  \ in streams in a manner that would allow the aquatic biological community to recover.\
  \ \n\nFunding is available to assist local 501(c)(3) status organizations (e.g.,\
  \ watershed groups), organizations using AmeriCorps and its VISTA programs, local\
  \ governments, tribal governments, and most state government agencies."
