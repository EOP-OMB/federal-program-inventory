objective: "In accordance with Section 404 of SMCRA, lands and water eligible for\
  \ reclamation or drainage abatement under Section 404 of Public Law 95-87 (the Act),\
  \ Stat. 445-532 as amended, are those which were mined for coal or which were affected\
  \ by mining, waste banks, coal processing, or other coal mining processes prior\
  \ to August 3, 1977, and left in an unclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition,\
  \ for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under state or other\
  \ Federal laws. The funding priorities and technical focus for this announcement\
  \ are to use appropriated PTPP funds for the comprehensive abatement and treatment\
  \ of water pollution discharged from abandoned mine lands to restore water quality\
  \ in streams in a manner that would allow the aquatic biological community to recover.\
  \ \n\nFunding is available to assist local 501(c)(3) status organizations (e.g.,\
  \ watershed groups), organizations using AmeriCorps and its VISTA programs, local\
  \ governments, tribal governments, and most state government agencies."

- description: Funding Opportunities have not yet been posted for this fiscal year.
    It is anticipated that funding will be made available to assist not-for-profit
    IRS 501 (c)(3) status organizations (e.g., watershed groups), organizations using
    AmeriCorps and its VISTA programs, local governments, tribal governments, and
    most state government agencies. The funding priorities and technical focus for
    this announcement are to use appropriated PTPP funds for the comprehensive abatement
    and treatment of water pollution discharged from abandoned mine lands to restore
    water quality in streams in a manner that would allow the aquatic biological community
    to recover. Non-Federal entities will use PTPP funds for operation and maintenance
    costs for new passive treatment systems. Projects may also include repair and
    renovation of previously installed passive water treatment systems and operation
    and maintenance costs for existing passive treatment systems.
