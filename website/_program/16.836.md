  capacity, specifically relating to youth and their legal representation, and access
  to services pre- and post-adjudication; (3) analyzing the juvenile defense delivery
  system(s) with respect to juvenile offenders’ access to services by identifying
  critical program, practice, and policy needs and gaps; areas for improvement; and
  aspects that are working and may be replicable and/or scalable across jurisdictions;
  and (4) addressing an identified need or gap within the applicant’s juvenile justice
  system related to providing juvenile offenders with plenary access to high-quality
  juvenile defense services.
