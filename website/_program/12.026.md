- description: “CWIFP published its first Notice of Funding Availability, soliciting
    preliminary applications from prospective borrowers. The program invited 18 applicants
    to submit full applications. Those projects represent $3.2 billion in credit assistance
    for critical dam safety investments across 12 states. USACE estimates that the
    $3.2 billion in new investment will create upwards of 10,100 jobs and save its
    borrowers up to $875 million in interest costs compared to alternative sources
    of financing.”
