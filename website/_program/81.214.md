- description: 'Fiscal Year 2022: Fiscal Year 2022: South Carolina Department of Natural
    Resources (SCDNR) serves as primary manager of the Crackerneck Wildlife Management
    Area and Ecological Reserve (Crackerneck), SCDNR implemented all aspects of the
    comprehensive Management Plan for Crackerneck. The SCDNR formulated and implemented
    the public, outdoor recreation program, 70 days were planned for recreation at
    Crackerneck but due to the Covid-19 virus closure only 54 days were implemented.
    A new site use covering the recreation schedule for the area was submitted and
    approved. The SCDNR served as a core team member within the Forest-ID Team to
    insure Crackerneck natural resource prescriptions were consistent with habitat
    goals outlined in the Management Plan for the area. Frequent meetings with US
    Forest Service Savannah River Site (USFS-SRS) personnel were held to ensure implementation
    of future timber harvests, road construction/maintenance, and prescribed burning
    complied with approved prescriptions and site uses. South Carolina Department
    of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) reviewed two Records of Decisions
    (ROD), eight secondary documents, and six administrative duties during 2022. South
    Carolina Emergency Management Division (SCEMD) updated and revised the Savannah
    River Site (SRS) site specific annex to the South Carolina (SC) Operation Radiological
    Emergency Response Plan. Coordinated, reviewed and validated the local emergency
    response plans of Aiken, Allendale, and Barnwell Counties. Educated the public
    about safeguarding themselves and their property from hazards associated with
    SRS operations. Enhanced alert and warning capabilities. Coordinated training
    for state, Aiken, Allendale and Barnwell county emergency response personnel.
    Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) reviewed and updated Annex C (Savannah
    River Site) to the Georgia Radiological Emergency Plan (REP). GEMA reviewed and
    updated in cooperation with Burke County Emergency Management Agency the Burke
    County REP Plan. GEMA conducted periodic meetings of the Radiation Working Group
    (RWG) to enhance coordination on emergency management/response issues. GEMA conducted
    training for state and local emergency response personnel whose services may be
    required in the event of a radiological incident at SRS. Savannah River Ecology
    Lab (SREL) provided the public with an independent evaluation of the ecological
    effects of SRS operations on the environment through a program of ecological research,
    education and outreach. The community outreach portion of the program relies on
    traditional methods of community involvement, including workshops and outreach
    meetings. Savannah State University (SSU) provides education and community outreach.
    The approach in the education arena combines an intern program, with expanding
    environmental curricula. City of Savannah (COS) provided daily monitoring of the
    tritium concentrations in the Savannah River to ensure the integrity of the raw
    water being used throughout the Savannah area from excessive concentrations of
    tritium to protect public health and safety. South Carolina Institute of Archeology
    and Anthropology (SCIAA) continued advancement of State knowledge for the cultural
    heritage of the SRS, the Central Savannah River Area (CSRA) and the southeastern
    United States. Supported accomplishment of scientific research, dissemination
    of knowledge in the academic and public sectors. Continued Preservation of the
    physical remains of the cultural heritage of the area.'
