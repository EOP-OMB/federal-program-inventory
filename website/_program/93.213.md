objective: 'NCCIH is the lead Federal agency for scientific research on the fundamental
  science, usefulness, and safety of complementary and integrative treatments and
  practices. NCCIH seeks to build knowledge across disciplines, focusing on the whole
  person, and taking a transdisciplinary approach that integrates the natural, social,
  and health sciences and transcends traditional boundaries. To address the need for
  objective evidence on the fundamental science, safety and efficacy of complementary
  and integrative health approaches, NCCIH supports rigorous scientific investigation
  to better understand how these interventions impact health, for whom, and the optimal
  methods of practice and delivery. By deepening our scientific understanding of the
  connections that exist across domains of human health, we can better understand
  how conditions interrelate, define multicomponent interventions that address these
  problems, and expand how we support patients through the full continuum of their
  health experience, including the return to health.

  To evaluate  complementary and integrative health approaches.  The following objectives
  support this goal:  (1) coordinate and facilitate the investigation of complementary
  and integrative health approaches through peer-reviewed grant solicitations; (2)
  interface with the NCCIH National Advisory Council; (3) conduct technology assessment
  conferences for the purpose of establishing areas of Clinical and Pre-clinical research
  that need to be further developed within complementary health approaches; and (4)
  maintain a comprehensive bibliographic data base in conjunction with the National
  Library of Medicine.


  The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) regularly examines
  and redefines its research priorities. In setting research priorities, NCCIH considers
  its existing research portfolio, its 5-year strategic plan, the recommendations
  of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative Health, current
  scientific advances, the plans of other NIH institutes and centers, and input from
  expert panels and stakeholders. Research constituting a rigorous evidence base for
  complementary health approaches will be developed through a range of research strategies
  including basic and translational research, and clinical investigation. Priority
  setting also takes into account: 1)scientific promise, 2)amenability to rigorous
  scientific inquiry,3) potential to change health practices, and 4) relationship
  to use and practice.


  Research Approaches

  Basic, translational, efficacy/effectiveness, and implementation research for Complementary
  and Integrative Health approaches need to be studied across the research continuum.  NCCIH
  continues to emphasize basic research that defines biological effects and mechanisms
  of action; this research is aimed at understanding the nature of complementary health
  approaches such as their biology, physiology, and physical, chemical and behavioral
  properties. NCCIH also supports the development of tools, models, and methodologies
  for studying these approaches. NCCIH  continues to encourage efficacy studies to
  determine specific clinical effects of complementary health approaches  under carefully
  controlled conditions that minimize nonspecific and contextual effects. There is
  also the need to strengthen translational and preliminary clinical research required
  to design and implement definitive clinical research and "real world" outcomes and
  effectiveness research that capitalizes on the reality that many complementary health
  approaches  are in widespread public use.


  NCCIH’s support of translational research addresses the need for valid, reliable
  and relevant research tools, outcome measures, and innovative methodology to enhance
  the rigor of complementary health approaches within clinical studies and to ensure
  that they are maximally informative. NCCIH emphasizes studies that inform the design
  of future trials such as those that will: develop and validate outcome measures;
  standardize treatment protocols or algorithms;  validate treatment algorithms and/or;
  develop measures of quality control or treatment fidelity; assess effects of various
  doses or intervention durations; develop preliminary clinical evidence regarding
  efficacy and safety to support estimates of sample size; or establish feasibility
  of interventions or study designs in specific populations for future studies.'
