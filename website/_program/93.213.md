objective: "To evaluate  complementary and integrative health approaches.  The following\
  \ objectives support this goal:  (1) coordinate and facilitate the investigation\
  \ of complementary and integrative health approaches through peer-reviewed grant\
  \ solicitations; (2) interface with the NCCIH National Advisory Council; (3) conduct\
  \ technology assessment conferences for the purpose of establishing areas of Clinical\
  \ and Pre-clinical research that need to be further developed within complementary\
  \ health approaches; and (4) maintain a comprehensive bibliographic data base in\
  \ conjunction with the National Library of Medicine.\n\nThe National Center for\
  \ Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) regularly examines and redefines\
  \ its research priorities. In setting research priorities, NCCIH considers its existing\
  \ research portfolio, its 5-year strategic plan, the recommendations of the National\
  \ Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative Health, current scientific\
  \ advances, the plans of other NIH institutes and centers, and input from expert\
  \ panels and stakeholders. Research constituting a rigorous evidence base for complementary\
  \ health approaches will be developed through a range of research strategies including\
  \ basic and translational research, and clinical investigation. Priority setting\
  \ also takes into account: 1)scientific promise, 2)amenability to rigorous scientific\
  \ inquiry,3) potential to change health practices, and 4) relationship to use and\
  \ practice.\n\nResearch Approaches\nBasic, translational, efficacy/effectiveness,\
  \ and implementation research for Complementary and Integrative Health approaches\
  \ need to be studied across the research continuum.  NCCIH continues to emphasize\
  \ basic research that defines biological effects and mechanisms of action; this\
  \ research is aimed at understanding the nature of complementary health approaches\
  \ such as their biology, physiology, and physical, chemical and behavioral properties.\
  \ NCCIH also supports the development of tools, models, and methodologies for studying\
  \ these approaches. NCCIH  continues to encourage efficacy studies to determine\
  \ specific clinical effects of complementary health approaches  under carefully\
  \ controlled conditions that minimize nonspecific and contextual effects. There\
  \ is also the need to strengthen translational and preliminary clinical research\
  \ required to design and implement definitive clinical research and \"real world\"\
  \ outcomes and effectiveness research that capitalizes on the reality that many\
  \ complementary health approaches  are in widespread public use.\n\nNCCIH’s support\
  \ of translational research addresses the need for valid, reliable and relevant\
  \ research tools, outcome measures, and innovative methodology to enhance the rigor\
  \ of complementary health approaches within clinical studies and to ensure that\
  \ they are maximally informative. NCCIH emphasizes studies that inform the design\
  \ of future trials such as those that will: develop and validate outcome measures;\
  \ standardize treatment protocols or algorithms;  validate treatment algorithms\
  \ and/or; develop measures of quality control or treatment fidelity; assess effects\
  \ of various doses or intervention durations; develop preliminary clinical evidence\
  \ regarding efficacy and safety to support estimates of sample size; or establish\
  \ feasibility of interventions or study designs in specific populations for future\
  \ studies.\n\nNCCIH's clinical research portfolio utilizes clinical trial, case-control,\
  \ observational, cohort, qualitative, and other experimental methodologies to determine\
  \ safety and estimate the efficacy of complementary health approaches. The clinical\
  \ research portfolio  includes effectiveness studies of the contribution to improved\
  \ health and wellness made by complementary health approaches  as they are practiced\
  \ in \"real-world\" settings.\nIn general, phase III clinical trials will be supported\
  \ under the cooperative agreement mechanism after careful consideration by NCCIH\
  \ Staff. Investigators interested in proposing phase III studies are strongly encouraged\
  \ to contact a relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers).\n\
  \nAreas of Special Interest\nFundamental scientific inquiry is essential to the\
  \ progress of biomedicine by enhancing the understanding of how living systems work.\
  \ This understanding serves as a foundation for translational and clinical studies\
  \ that can lead to improved approaches to the management, treatment, and prevention\
  \ of diseases and symptoms. One key goal is to advance our understanding of basic\
  \ biological mechanisms of action of natural products, including prebiotics and\
  \ probiotics. NCCIH will continue to sponsor research on compounds isolated from\
  \ natural products as well as complex mixtures from which they originate. Additionally,\
  \ NCCIH will continue to support research to elucidate the effects of prebiotics\
  \ and probiotics on the microbiota naturally present in the human body. \n\nAnother\
  \ key goal is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of action by which\
  \ mind and body approaches (including, but not limited to: meditation, spinal manipulation,\
  \ massage, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis and acupuncture) affect health, resiliency, and\
  \ well-being.   \n\nA third key goal is to develop new and improved research methods\
  \ and tools for conducting rigorous studies of complementary health approaches and\
  \ their integration into health care. These new methods could catalyze advances\
  \ in natural product methodology and support development of novel technology and\
  \ instruments to carry out rigorous research on symptom management and functional\
  \ changes primarily for mind and body approaches. To improve care for hard -to-manage\
  \ symptoms such as pain, anxiety, and depression, both mind and body practices and\
  \ natural products will be rigorously studied using well-established methodology.\
  \ \nNCCIH will also support studies in \"real world\" clinical settings to test\
  \ the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches, including their integration\
  \ into health care. \n\nIndividual behavior plays a key role in health promotion\
  \ and disease prevention. It is well established that adopting and maintaining healthy\
  \ behaviors (e.g., diet and exercise) and modifying unhealthy behaviors reduces\
  \ risks of major chronic diseases. NCCIH will investigate mechanisms of action of\
  \ complementary and integrative health approaches in health resilience and practices\
  \ that improve health and prevent disease. These approaches will be studied across\
  \ the lifespan and in diverse populations. NCCIH will also explore research opportunities\
  \ to study and access the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches\
  \ in nonclinical settings such as community- and employer-based wellness programs.\
  \  \n\nTop Scientific Priorities\nThe top scientific priorities include the nonpharmacologic\
  \ management of pain,  neurobiological effects and mechanisms, innovative approaches\
  \ for establishing biological signatures of natural products, disease prevention\
  \ and health promotion across the lifespan, and clinical trials utilizing innovative\
  \ study designs to access complementary health approaches and their integration\
  \ into health care. Pain is the condition for which adults in the United States\
  \ most often use complementary and integrative health approaches. Growing evidence\
  \ indicates that some complementary health approaches may help in its treatment\
  \ and management. Discovering the mechanisms by which a complementary approach exerts\
  \ its effects could help in the design of better treatments and predict which people\
  \ are most likely to respond. Whether and how complementary health approaches directly\
  \ modulate or modify the structure and/or the function of the entire or part of\
  \ the nervous system remains understudied. Advances in genomics, neuroscience, stem\
  \ cells, systems biology, and neuroimaging offer excellent conceptual resources\
  \ and opportunities for innovative and impactful mechanistic studies of complementary\
  \ health approaches. The purpose of innovative approaches for establishing biological\
  \ signatures of natural products is to advance the characterization of the biologic\
  \ activity of complex natural products broadly with an emphasis on determining metabolic\
  \ profiles. There has been a growing interest in the use of complementary health\
  \ approaches for the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders \
  \ and for the promotion of psychological and physical health, well-being, and resilience.\
  \ However, the evidence for the use of complementary modalities in the context of\
  \ prevention and health promotion is modest. Rigorously designed, developmentally\
  \ appropriate studies are needed to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of\
  \ complementary health approaches for health promotion and disease prevention across\
  \ the lifespan.\n\nEarly Stage and New Investigators\nNCCIH is strongly committed\
  \ to assisting new and early stage investigators in establishing a research career.\
  \ Early stage investigators are those within 10 years of completing their terminal\
  \ research degree, or their medical residency, or its equivalent. New investigators\
  \ are those who have yet to compete successfully for a substantial (e.g., R01) NIH\
  \ research grant. Each Advisory Council round, based on available funds, NCCIH:\
  \ 1) will consider early stage or new investigator status as one of the criteria\
  \ for designating grant applications as being of high program priority and 2) may\
  \ make additional R01 grant awards to new and early stage investigators with percentiles\
  \ or scores out of  payline order.\n\nNCCIH continues to accept applications in\
  \ areas not listed as a specific priority area via the investigator initiated funding\
  \ opportunities. All investigators are urged to discuss potential applications with\
  \ the relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers)"
