    Native American communities throughout the country to improve housing conditions
    and stimulate community development for residents, including funding construction
    projects and local jobs. The ICDBG grants helps supports a wide range of community
    development and affordable housing activities. The goal of the program is to develop
    viable Indian and Alaska Native communities, including neighborhoods with decent
    housing, suitable living environments, and economic opportunities. Communities
    can use the grants to rehab or build new housing; to buy land for housing; for
    infrastructure projects such as roads, water and sewer facilities; and to spur
    economic development including jobs.

- description: The program will provide funding for housing rehabilitation, mold remediation,
    new construction, infrastructure, community facilities, reducing imminent threats,
    and economic development in 5400 tribal communities. HUD awarded around $56 million
    to 80 Native American tribes throughout the country to improve housing conditions
    and to stimulate economic development in their communities. The ICDBG program
    helps supports a wide range of community development and affordable housing activities,
    from new housing for individual families to community amenities like rec centers
    or water lines. With a deep need for more affordable housing in tribal communities,
    most of this year’s project winners will use their ICDBG funds to build homes
    or to rehabilitate dilapidated housing, in order to alleviate homelessness, relieve
    overcrowding, and avoid members having to leave their community – spurring jobs
    and economic development along the way. Many tribes will also use the funds for
    other community needs.
