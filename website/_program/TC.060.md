objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows interest
  earned on State and local bonds used to finance homes purchased by first-time, low-to-moderate-income
  buyers to be exempt from tax. These bonds are generally subject to the State privateactivity-
  bond annual volume cap.
