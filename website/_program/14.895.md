objective: 'The Jobs Plus program develops locally based, job-driven approaches that
  increase earnings and advance employment outcomes through work readiness, employer
  linkages, job placement, educational advancement, technology skills, and financial
  literacy for residents of public housing. The place-based Jobs Plus program addresses
  poverty among public housing residents by incentivizing and enabling employment
  through earned income disregards for working residents and a set of services designed
  to support work including employer linkages, job placement and counseling, educational
  advancement, and financial counseling. Ideally, these incentives will saturate the
  target public housing development, building a culture of work and making working
  residents the norm. The Jobs Plus program model comprises these three core components:
  Employment-Related Services; Financial/Rent Incentive â€“ Jobs Plus Earned Income
  Disregard (JPEID); and Community Supports for Work.'
