objective: "The Jobs Plus program develops locally based, job-driven approaches that\
  \ increase earnings and advance employment outcomes through work readiness, employer\
  \ linkages, job placement, educational advancement, technology skills, and financial\
  \ literacy for residents of public housing. The place-based Jobs Plus program addresses\
  \ poverty among public housing residents by incentivizing and enabling employment\
  \ through earned income disregards for working residents and a set of services designed\
  \ to support work including employer linkages, job placement and counseling, educational\
  \ advancement, and financial counseling. Ideally, these incentives will saturate\
  \ the target public housing development, building a culture of work and making working\
  \ residents the norm. The Jobs Plus program model comprises these three core components:\
  \ Employment-Related Services; Financial/Rent Incentive \u2013 Jobs Plus Earned\
  \ Income Disregard (JPEID); and Community Supports for Work."
