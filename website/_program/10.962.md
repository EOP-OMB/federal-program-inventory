- description: Malaysia’s Ministry of Health will implement new policies related to
    the amount of sampling required to monitor imported foods, introduced by a 2023
    program participant on regulatory protocols on import/export documentation and
    sanitary/logistical practices. The participant cited the program as having a significant
    impact on the policy, providing clarity on requirements associated with the importation
    of agricultural products. The new policy for Malaysia will help decrease the costs
    associated with importing goods due to more efficient monitoring practices.
