objective: "The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58) which is\
  \ generally referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), enacted November\
  \ 15, 2021, provides new grant authority and appropriated $60 million for EPA to\
  \ issue grants, including grants to the 12 Hypoxia Task Force (HTF) States (Arkansas,\
  \ Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri,\
  \ Ohio, Tennessee, Wisconsin) to support the implementation of the Gulf Hypoxia\
  \ Action Plan.  This Assistance Listing considers relevant approaches to achieving\
  \ the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent with statutory requirements,\
  \ including priorities in Executive Order 14052, Implementation of the Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act, to invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high\
  \ labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America, and build infrastructure\
  \ that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis. Awardees are required to\
  \ provide annual progress reports which will be used to measure successful implementation\
  \ and support evaluation.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023:  EPA\u2019s funding\
  \ priority is to award funds to HTF states to implement nutrient reduction strategies\
  \ and advance bold, systemic actions that accelerate nutrient load reductions in\
  \ the MARB and to the Gulf of Mexico. EPA expects states to develop workplans that\
  \ prioritize those actions most effective at reducing nutrient loads, using both\
  \ proven and innovative approaches, that are now possible with BIL funding for the\
  \ Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan.  Funding Priority - Fiscal Year 2024: EPA\u2019s funding\
  \ priority is to award funds to HTF states to implement nutrient reduction strategies\
  \ and advance bold, systemic actions that accelerate nutrient load reductions in\
  \ the MARB and to the Gulf of Mexico. EPA expects states to develop workplans that\
  \ prioritize those actions most effective at reducing nutrient loads, using both\
