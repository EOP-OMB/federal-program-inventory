objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to
  apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law the
  interest earned on State and local government bonds issued to finance public purpose
  construction (e.g., schools, roads, sewers), equipment acquisition, and other public
  purposes is tax-exempt. The interest on bonds issued by Indian tribal governments
  for essential governmental purposes is also tax-exempt.
