- description: "The amount available for FSOP awards was $6,663,007.\n\nThe Food Safety\
    \ Outreach Program (FSOP): Created by the Food Safety Modernization Act (2011)\
    \ (P.L. 111-353), FSOP awards grants to eligible recipients for projects that\
    \ develop and implement Food Safety Modernization Act-related food safety training,\
    \ education, extension, outreach, and technical assistance to owners and operations\
    \ of small and medium-sized farms, beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers,\
    \ small processors or small fresh fruit and vegetable merchant wholesalers.  These\
    \ are audiences affected by new food safety guidelines established under FSMA.\n\
    \ \nThe national implementation strategy for the Food Safety Modernization Act\
    \ (FSMA) began in fiscal years 15-16 between USDA NIFA and FDA CFSAN. They partnered\
    \ to establish a national infrastructure that will provide Education, Extension,\
    \ Outreach and Technical Assistance among 4 Regional Centers and 1 National Coordination\
    \ Center. In FY 16, the program evolved to create: Pilot, Community Outreach,\
    \ and Multistate Education and Outreach Projects under the Food Safety Outreach\
    \ Program (FSOP).  In FY 2018, the Food Safety Outreach Program further ingrained\
    \ the national infrastructure by funding 4 new regional centers with one serving\
    \ as the lead center to maintain the vigor of the program as the previous centers\
    \ begin to close out.  These centers support and coordinate training and outreach\
    \ and identify outcomes, impacts, and needs assessment for their regions.  In\
    \ FY 19, the program supported Multi-State and Community based projects.\n\nEligible\
    \ applicants include state or territory Cooperative Extension Services; non-government\
    \ organizations and community-based organizations that have expertise in administering\
    \ programs that contribute to food safety; federal, state, local, and tribal agencies;\
    \ and institutes of higher education; and collaborations of at least two eligible\
    \ entities. \n\nNIFA’s mission is to invest in and advance agricultural research,\
    \ education, and extension to solve societal challenges. NIFA’s investments in\
    \ transformative science directly support the long-term prosperity and global\
    \ preeminence of U.S. agriculture. To learn more about NIFA’s impact on agricultural\

    The 2018 Farm Bill, or the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, made several
    changes to the National Food Safety Training, education, Extension, Outreach,
    and Technical Assistance Program, otherwise known as the Food Safety Outreach
    Program (FSOP). The 2018 Farm Bill amendments to FSOP are applicable for Fiscal
    Year (FY) 2019. NSAC encourages NIFA to include all of these changes in the FY19
    FSOP RFA, as required by law, which includes the repeal of the match requirement,
    the repeal of the limitation on grant funds prohibiting an entity from receiving
    funding after three years, and the prioritization of projects that focus on beginning,
    socially disadvantaged, and veteran farmers.'

    to small, midsized, beginning, socially disadvantaged, and veteran farmers. NIFA
    will also collect data from FSOP award recipients to ensure projects are serving
    these audiences.'
