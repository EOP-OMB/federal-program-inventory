objective: The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) provides major
  economic and energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers and
  states. The Agency oversees the exploration and development of oil, natural gas
  and other minerals and renewable energy sources on the nation's Outer Continental
  Shelf (OCS). BSEE continues to look for better ways to serve the American people
  and to ensure that the nation receives the best oversight and regulation of national
  resource development now and into the future. BSEE not only supports decisions made
  within the Department of the Interior, but also provides coastal states and local
  governments with the information necessary to ensure that all stages of offshore
  energy and mineral activities are conducted in a manner that protects both human
  and natural environments. The OCS Lands Act (OCSLA) Sections 1347 and 1348 respectively
  mandate the development and enforcement of regulations that protect safety, health
  and the environment. OCSLA Section 1345 authorizes the use of cooperative agreements
  with affected states to meet the requirements of OCSLA, including sharing of information,
  joint utilization of available expertise, formation of joint monitoring arrangements
  to carry out applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and stipulations relevant
  to OCS operations both onshore and offshore. The purposes of the BSEE Office of
  Offshore Regulatory Programs (OORP) is to obtain information to improve the knowledge,
  practices, and technologies used to promote operational safety and pollution prevention
  for offshore oil and gas, wind, and other marine energy activities.
