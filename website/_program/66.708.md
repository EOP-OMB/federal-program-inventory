objective: 'The P2 grant program was enacted under the Pollution Prevention Act of
  1990 to: 1) Provide technical assistance (e.g., information, training and tools)
  to businesses/facilities on source reduction/P2 techniques to help them adopt and
  implement source reduction/P2 approaches that may increase the development, adoption,
  and market penetration of sustainable manufacturing and processing practices and
  greener products.  2) Identify, develop, document, and share source reduction/P2
  best management practices and innovations so the information generated may inform
  future technical assistance and encourage practices and innovations that may be
  replicated by others. The technical assistance provided must use P2/source reduction
  techniques to reduce and/or eliminate pollution from air, water and/or land prior
  to performing recycling, reuse, clean up or disposal activities. The P2 grant program
  funds may be awarded as grants and/or cooperative agreements. Funding provided by
  the Infrastructure Investment and Job Act (IIJA) for FY2022-2026 affords the P2
  program the ability to further support P2 technical assistance to businesses. Updated
  information on these programs is on EPA’s Grant Program for Pollution Prevention
  website: https://www.epa.gov/p2/grant-programs-pollution-prevention.  In FY 2025,
  the P2 will continue to: 1. Help businesses adopt P2 techniques into day-to-day
  operations to reduce or eliminate harmful pollutants from entering the air, water
  or land 2. Encourage education and/or training in P2/source reduction techniques.
  3. Support P2 information sharing among states, state and federally-recognized tribal
  entities (e.g., state/tribal colleges/universities), federally-recognized tribes,
  local technical assistance programs, businesses, and industry.  Additional funding
  priorities are found in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) specific to each
  P2 grant program.'
