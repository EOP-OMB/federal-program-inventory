objective: 'The P2 grant program was enacted under the Pollution Prevention Act of
  1990 to: 1. Provide technical assistance (e.g., information, training and tools)
  to businesses/facilities on source reduction/P2 techniques to help them adopt and
  implement source reduction/P2 approaches that may increase the development, adoption,
  and market penetration of sustainable manufacturing and processing practices and
  greener products. 2. Identify, develop, document, and share source reduction/P2
  best management practices and innovations so the information generated may inform
  future technical assistance and encourage practices and innovations that may be
  replicated by others. The technical assistance provided must use P2/source reduction
  techniques to reduce and/or eliminate pollution from air, water and/or land prior
  to performing recycling, reuse, clean up or disposal activities. The P2 grant program
  funds may be awarded as grants and/or cooperative agreements.  Infrastructure Investment
  and Job Act (IIJA) funds affords the P2 program the ability to further support  P2
  technical assistance to businesses.   Under the FY 24-25 P2 grant program award
  cycle, the P2 Program is planning to release additional P2 grant funds, again under
  two separate grant announcements. Updated information on these programs will be
  shared on EPA’s Grant Program for Pollution Prevention here for further details:
  https://www.epa.gov/p2/grant-programs-pollution-prevention.


  Funding Priorities are: 1. Help businesses adopt P2 techniques into day-to-day operations
  to reduce or eliminate harmful pollutants from entering the air, water or land 2.
  Encourage education and/or training in P2/source reduction techniques. 3. Support
  P2 information sharing among states, state and federally-recognized tribal entities
  (e.g., state/tribal colleges/universities), federally-recognized tribes, local technical
  assistance programs, businesses, and industry. 4. During the FY23-24 grant competition
  cycle and the anticipated FY24-25 grant competition cycle, support environmental
  justice (EJ) and/or climate change work. To find out more on how EJ and climate
  change are defined by the P2 Program and how each can be utilized through P2 grant
  work, please see EPA’s Grant Programs for P2 page here: https://www.epa.gov/p2/grant-programs-pollution-prevention.
  Additional funding priorities may be found in the grant announcement specific to
  each P2 grant program announcement. Please see EPA’s Grant Program for Pollution
  Prevention here for further details: https://www.epa.gov/p2/grant-programs-pollution-prevention.'
