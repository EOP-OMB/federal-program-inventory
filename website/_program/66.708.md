objective: "The P2 grant program was enacted under the Pollution Prevention Act of\
  \ 1990 to: 1. Provide technical assistance (e.g., information, training and tools)\
  \ to businesses/facilities on source reduction/P2 techniques to help them adopt\
  \ and implement source reduction/P2 approaches that may increase the development,\
  \ adoption, and market penetration of sustainable manufacturing and processing practices\
  \ and greener products. 2. Identify, develop, document, and share source reduction/P2\
  \ best management practices and innovations so the information generated may inform\
  \ future technical assistance and encourage practices and innovations that may be\
  \ replicated by others. The technical assistance provided must use P2/source reduction\
  \ techniques to reduce and/or eliminate pollution from air, water and/or land prior\
  \ to performing recycling, reuse, clean up or disposal activities. The P2 grant\
  \ program funds may be awarded as grants and/or cooperative agreements.  Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Job Act (IIJA) funds affords the P2 program the ability to further\
  \ support  P2 technical assistance to businesses.   Under the FY 24-25 P2 grant\
  \ program award cycle, the P2 Program is planning to release additional P2 grant\
  \ funds, again under two separate grant announcements. Updated information on these\
  \ programs will be shared on EPA\u2019s Grant Program for Pollution Prevention here\
  \ for further details: https://www.epa.gov/p2/grant-programs-pollution-prevention.\n\
  \nFunding Priorities are: 1. Help businesses adopt P2 techniques into day-to-day\
  \ operations to reduce or eliminate harmful pollutants from entering the air, water\
  \ or land 2. Encourage education and/or training in P2/source reduction techniques.\
  \ 3. Support P2 information sharing among states, state and federally-recognized\
  \ tribal entities (e.g., state/tribal colleges/universities), federally-recognized\
  \ tribes, local technical assistance programs, businesses, and industry. 4. During\
  \ the FY23-24 grant competition cycle and the anticipated FY24-25 grant competition\
  \ cycle, support environmental justice (EJ) and/or climate change work. To find\
  \ out more on how EJ and climate change are defined by the P2 Program and how each\
  \ can be utilized through P2 grant work, please see EPA\u2019s Grant Programs for\
  \ P2 page here: https://www.epa.gov/p2/grant-programs-pollution-prevention. Additional\
  \ funding priorities may be found in the grant announcement specific to each P2\
  \ grant program announcement. Please see EPA\u2019s Grant Program for Pollution\
  \ Prevention here for further details: https://www.epa.gov/p2/grant-programs-pollution-prevention."
