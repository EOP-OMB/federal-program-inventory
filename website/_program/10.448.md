objective: The Rural Housing Voucher Demonstration program is designed to provide
  rental housing assistance vouchers to tenants in properties that pay off their Rural
  Development mortgage.  The amount of this subsidy is the difference between the
  comparable market rent and the amount of rent being paid by the tenant when pay
  off occurs.  Pay off properties may be located anywhere in the 50 states, Puerto
  Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.
