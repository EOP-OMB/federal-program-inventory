objective: 'This program assists States (including territories and the District of
  Columbia), Regional Public Comprehensive Planning Organizations (RPCPOs), and Interstate
  Organizations (IOs) in carrying out water quality management (WQM) planning.


  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA, Public Law 117-58), also
  known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), will infuse approximately $127,000,000
  into states’ planning efforts between Fiscal Years 2022 - 2026. Consistent with
  Executive Order 14052, Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
  Act (November 15, 2021) and the EPA FY22 – 26 EPA Strategic Plan, EPA developed
  interim implementation guidelines for the award and administration of 604(b) funds
  that promote the integration of climate, equity, and environmental justice considerations
  into states’ water quality management planning programs and activities.


  Funds are allotted by state in accordance with Section 604(b) of the Clean Water
  Act and are used to determine the nature and extent of point and non-point source
  water pollution and to develop water quality management plans.'
