objective: "The goal of the OSMRE Applied Science Program is to develop and demonstrate\
  \ improved science based technologies to address environmental, and restoration\
  \ topics related to the mining of coal.  The first objective to help us meet this\
  \ goal is to develop technical tools to improve the efficiency and accuracy of regulatory\
  \ authorities in permitting coal mines and administering their federally approved\
  \ regulatory program.  A second objective is to examine the potential for new technologies\
  \ that can aid in the protection of the public and the environment during mining\
  \ and reclamation.  A third objective is to provide opportunities for college and\
  \ university students to participate in research projects related to coal mining\
  \ and reclamation issues in order to build a pool of qualified potential applicants\
  \ for future implementation of SMCRA.\n\nMine Drainage Technology Initiative (MDTI)\
  \ (formally known as the Acid Mine Drainage Initiative) provides a forum for collaboration\
  \ and information exchange with the following goals:\n\u2022Develop an understanding\
  \ of acidic and toxic mine drainage (MD) so as to better predict, avoid, monitor,\
  \ and remediate mine drainage;\n\u2022Develop innovative solutions to acidic and\
  \ toxic MD water-quality problems;\n\u2022Identify, evaluate, and develop \u201C\
  best science\u201D practices to predict acidic and toxic MD prior to mining; and\n\
  \u2022Identify successful remediation practices for existing sources of acidic and\
  \ toxic MD and describe the best technology for its prevention.\n\nOSMRE is looking\
  \ for MDTI studies that address the goals listed above that have the potential for\
  \ improving the effectiveness of both the coal industry and the regulatory authority\
  \ to conduct and regulate surface coal mining and reclamation activities that protect\
  \ the environment and the public."
