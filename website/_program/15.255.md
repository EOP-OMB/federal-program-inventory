objective: 'The goal of the OSMRE Applied Science Program is to develop and demonstrate
  improved science based technologies to address environmental, and restoration topics
  related to the mining of coal.  The first objective to help us meet this goal is
  to develop technical tools to improve the efficiency and accuracy of regulatory
  authorities in permitting coal mines and administering their federally approved
  regulatory program.  A second objective is to examine the potential for new technologies
  that can aid in the protection of the public and the environment during mining and
  reclamation.  A third objective is to provide opportunities for college and university
  students to participate in research projects related to coal mining and reclamation
  issues in order to build a pool of qualified potential applicants for future implementation
  of SMCRA.


  Mine Drainage Technology Initiative (MDTI) (formally known as the Acid Mine Drainage
  Initiative) provides a forum for collaboration and information exchange with the
  following goals:

  •Develop an understanding of acidic and toxic mine drainage (MD) so as to better
  predict, avoid, monitor, and remediate mine drainage;

  •Develop innovative solutions to acidic and toxic MD water-quality problems;

  •Identify, evaluate, and develop “best science” practices to predict acidic and
  toxic MD prior to mining; and

  •Identify successful remediation practices for existing sources of acidic and toxic
  MD and describe the best technology for its prevention.


  OSMRE is looking for MDTI studies that address the goals listed above that have
  the potential for improving the effectiveness of both the coal industry and the
  regulatory authority to conduct and regulate surface coal mining and reclamation
  activities that protect the environment and the public.'

- description: One project was selected for FY 2022. It was funded at $200,000. This
    project will have the potential for improving the effectiveness of both the coal
    industry and the regulatory authority to conduct and regulate surface coal mining
    and reclamation activities that protect the environment and the public.
  year: '2022'
- description: One (1) MDTI project was selected for FY 2023. It was funded at $200,000.
    This project will have the potential for improving the effectiveness of both the
    coal industry and the regulatory authority to conduct and regulate surface coal
    mining and reclamation activities that protect the environment and the public.
    There were eight (8) Applied Science projects funded in 2023 (selected in 2022)
    which were awarded to various research universities. These awards were in the
    amount of $200,000.
  year: '2023'
- description: In FY 2024 there were eighteen (18) active Applied Science awards.
    These awards were issued to research universities and one State agency.
