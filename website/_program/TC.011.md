objective: The baseline tax system would allow recovery of the costs of developing
  certain oil and gas properties using cost depletion. Cost depletion is similar in
  concept to depreciation, in that the costs of developing or acquiring the asset
  are capitalized and then gradually reduced over an estimate of the asset’s economic
  life, as is appropriate for measuring net income. In contrast, the Tax Code generally
  allows independent oil and gas producers and royalty owners to take percentage depletion
  deductions rather than cost depletion on limited quantities of output. Under percentage
  depletion, taxpayers deduct a percentage of gross income from oil and gas production.
  In certain cases the deduction is limited to a fraction of the asset’s net income.
  Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost
  of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion may provide more advantageous
  tax treatment than would cost depletion, which limits deductions to an investment’s
  cost.
