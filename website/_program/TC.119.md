objective: Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments
  and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. Furthermore, all compensation
  would generally be deductible by the employer. In contrast, under current law employer-provided
  meals and lodging are excluded from an employeeâ€™s gross income. Additionally, beginning
  in 2018, employers are allowed a deduction for only 50 percent of the expenses of
  employer-provided meals, except that in 2021 and 2022, employers are eligible for
  a full deduction on restaurant meals provided to employees. Employer-provided lodging
  is fully deductible by the employer, in general.
