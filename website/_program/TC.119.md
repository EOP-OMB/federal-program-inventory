objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. In contrast, current law provides a credit equal to
  25 percent of qualified expenses for employee child care and 10 percent of qualified
  expenses for child care resource and referral services. Employer deductions for
  such expenses are reduced by the amount of the credit. The maximum total credit
  is limited to $150,000 per taxable year.
