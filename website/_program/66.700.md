  the District of Columbia and Indian tribes, in developing and maintaining comprehensive
  pesticide programs that address all aspects of pesticide enforcement, and special

  and (c) encourage regulatory activities within the states, territories, and tribes.
  In Fiscal Year 2025 Grantees must conduct activities related to: (1) Basic Pesticide
  Program; (2) Pesticide Worker Safety: Worker Protection Standard; (3) Worker Safety:
  Pesticide Applicator Certification; (4) Pesticides in Water; (5) Product Integrity;
  (6) Border Compliance. Grantees also must choose two additional programmatic areas,
  one from OPP and one from OECA, from the following: (1) Fumigation and Fumigants;
  (2) Endangered Species Protection; (3) Bed Bugs; Pollinator Protection; (4) Integrated
  Pest Management; (5) Spray Drift; (6) State and Tribal Coordination and Communication;
  (7) Emerging Public Health Pesticide Issues. These activities include inspections
  at pesticide application sites to ensure user compliance with label directions and
  acceptable use practices; inspections of pesticide products at producing facilities
  and in the retail marketplace to ensure industry compliance with registration, classification
  and labeling requirements; and initiation of appropriate enforcement action when
  violations are detected including civil and criminal prosecution, stop sale orders,

    groups, as well as other government agencies to promote the proper use of pesticides
    and address pesticide issues. These programs conduct extensive technical assistance
    for all stakeholders as well as the general public, and provide outreach and education
    on EPA’s national pesticide priorities such as worker protection, pollinator protection
    and emerging public health pesticide issues. If enforcement funds are included,
    these funds are used to enforce FIFRA. -
