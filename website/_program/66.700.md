  agreement program receive funds to support and strengthen their pesticide compliance
  programs, including pesticide compliance monitoring, inspection and enforcement
  activities. To: (a) assist states, territories and possessions of the U.S., including
  the District of Columbia and Indian tribes, in developing and maintaining comprehensive
  pesticide programs that address all aspects of pesticide enforcement, and special
  pesticide initiatives; (b) sponsor cooperative monitoring and analytical procedures;
  and (c) encourage regulatory activities within the states, territories, and tribes.
  Funding Priorities - Funding Fiscal Year 2023: Grantees must conduct activities
  related to: (1) Basic Pesticide Program; (2) Pesticide Worker Safety: Worker Protection
  Standard; (3) Worker Safety: Pesticide Applicator Certification; (4) Pesticides
  in Water; (5) Product Integrity; (6) Border Compliance. Grantees also must choose
  two additional programmatic areas, one from OPP and one from OECA, from the following:
  (1) Fumigation and Fumigants; (2) Endangered Species Protection; (3) Bed Bugs; Pollinator
  Protection; (4) Integrated Pest Management; (5) Spray Drift; (6) State and Tribal
  Coordination and Communication; (7) Emerging Public Health Pesticide Issues. These
  activities include inspections at pesticide application sites to ensure user compliance
  with label directions and acceptable use practices; inspections of pesticide products
  at producing facilities and in the retail marketplace to ensure industry compliance
  with registration, classification and labeling requirements; and initiation of appropriate
  enforcement action when violations are detected including civil and criminal prosecution,
  stop sale orders, seizures, recalls and warning notices.'

    pesticide programs work extensively with pesticide applicators, growers, commodity
    groups, as well as other government agencies to promote the proper use of pesticides
    and address pesticide issues. These programs conduct extensive technical assistance
    for all stakeholders as well as the general public, and provide outreach and education
    on EPA’s national pesticide priorities such as worker protection, pollinator protection
    and emerging public health pesticide issues. If enforcement funds are included,
    these funds are used to enforce FIFRA. -
