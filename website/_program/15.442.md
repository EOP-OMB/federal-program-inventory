objective: "The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) program provides\
  \ major economic and energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers\
  \ and states. The Agency oversees the exploration and development of oil, natural\
  \ gas and other materials and renewable energy alternatives on the Nation's outer\
  \ continental shelf. BSEE continues to look for better ways to serve the American\
  \ people and to ensure that the Nation receives the best oversight and regulation\
  \ of National resource development now and into the future. The program not only\
  \ supports decisions made within the Department of the Interior, but also provides\
  \ coastal states and local governments with the information necessary to ensure\
  \ that all stages of offshore energy and mineral activities are conducted in a manner\
  \ to protect both the human and natural environments. \nThrough this cooperative\
  \ agreement, training and learning opportunities will be provided to young people\
  \ in order to develop the next generation of lifelong conservation stewards and\
  \ protect, restore, and enhance America’s Great Outdoors. Specifically, this cooperative\
  \ agreement will give young people the opportunity to learn about the importance\
  \ of the BSEE mission to promote safety, protect the environment and conserve resources\
  \ offshore through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement while exploring\
  \ future career options with BSEE.\nThe Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program\
  \ (ANSEP) are designated as tax exempt under the IRS for Institutions of Higher\
  \ Education. ANSEP moves Native American and Alaskan Native students into science,\
  \ technology, engineering and mathematics degree programs, and fosters a stronger\
  \ Indigenous American representation within the science workforce of BSEE. Established\
  \ in 1995, ANSEP has evolved into a longitudinal education model that provides a\
  \ continuous string of components beginning with students in sixth grade and continuing\
  \ on through high school, into science and engineering undergraduate and graduate\
  \ degree programs through PhD. ANSEP has received numerous recognitions for successfully\
  \ preparing students for professional science and engineering careers including\
  \ the U.S. Department of Energy’s Minorities in Energy Initiative, the U.S. Department\
  \ of the Interior Partners in Conservation Award, and the Ash Center for Democratic\
  \ Governance and Innovation, Harvard University-Top 25 Innovations in Government.\
  \  ANSEP, through this cooperative agreement, provides an opportunity to further\
  \ engage Alaska’s Native professionals, and develop the future scientific and engineering\
  \ employment pool required to support the BSEE mission. \nThe overall objective\
  \ is to expand the professional science employment preparedness of ANSEP students\
  \ and to develop a more diversified pool of highly educated professionals with the\
  \ BSEE workforce to reflect the rich diversity of the Nation."

results:
- description: 'BSEE Alaska OCS Regional office has hired 5 interns since 2016 to
    the spring of 2019.  All interns have moved on to higher positions elsewhere based
    on their experiences gained at BSEE.  The Alaska Region is currently waiting for
    the 2019 – 2020 UAA ANSEP academic year to begin to re-advertise and hire 2 more
    interns through 2020. BSEE Alaska region considers the program successful, as
    we are able to expose a number of students to Federal and agency employment opportunities.


    BSEE did advertise and receive applicants for the 2020 fiscal year however the
    program was cancelled due the COVID-19 pandemic as the student interns would need
    supervision and the agency mandate was to social distance and mandatory telework
    till the situation resolved itself.  Management felt an internship program was
    unfeasible until things normalize.  BSEE requests a hold on the funds until we
    can resume regular operations.'
