objective: "The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) program provides\
  \ major economic and energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers\
  \ and states. The Agency oversees the exploration and development of oil, natural\
  \ gas and other materials and renewable energy alternatives on the Nation's outer\
  \ continental shelf. BSEE continues to look for better ways to serve the American\
  \ people and to ensure that the Nation receives the best oversight and regulation\
  \ of National resource development now and into the future. The program not only\
  \ supports decisions made within the Department of the Interior, but also provides\
  \ coastal states and local governments with the information necessary to ensure\
  \ that all stages of offshore energy and mineral activities are conducted in a manner\
  \ to protect both the human and natural environments. \nThrough this cooperative\
  \ agreement, training and learning opportunities will be provided to young people\
  \ in order to develop the next generation of lifelong conservation stewards and\
  \ protect, restore, and enhance America\u2019s Great Outdoors. Specifically, this\
  \ cooperative agreement will give young people the opportunity to learn about the\
  \ importance of the BSEE mission to promote safety, protect the environment and\
  \ conserve resources offshore through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement\
  \ while exploring future career options with BSEE.\nThe Alaska Native Science and\
  \ Engineering Program (ANSEP) are designated as tax exempt under the IRS for Institutions\
  \ of Higher Education. ANSEP moves Native American and Alaskan Native students into\
  \ science, technology, engineering and mathematics degree programs, and fosters\
  \ a stronger Indigenous American representation within the science workforce of\
  \ BSEE. Established in 1995, ANSEP has evolved into a longitudinal education model\
  \ that provides a continuous string of components beginning with students in sixth\
  \ grade and continuing on through high school, into science and engineering undergraduate\
  \ and graduate degree programs through PhD. ANSEP has received numerous recognitions\
  \ for successfully preparing students for professional science and engineering careers\
  \ including the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Minorities in Energy Initiative,\
  \ the U.S. Department of the Interior Partners in Conservation Award, and the Ash\
  \ Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Harvard University-Top 25 Innovations\
  \ in Government.  ANSEP, through this cooperative agreement, provides an opportunity\
  \ to further engage Alaska\u2019s Native professionals, and develop the future scientific\
  \ and engineering employment pool required to support the BSEE mission. \nThe overall\
  \ objective is to expand the professional science employment preparedness of ANSEP\
  \ students and to develop a more diversified pool of highly educated professionals\
  \ with the BSEE workforce to reflect the rich diversity of the Nation."
