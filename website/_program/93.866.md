objective: 'To encourage biomedical, social, and behavioral research and research
  training directed toward greater understanding of the aging process and the diseases,
  special problems, and needs of people as they age. The National Institute on Aging
  has established programs to pursue these goals.  The Division of Aging Biology emphasizes
  understanding the basic biological processes of aging.  The Division of Geriatrics
  and Clinical Gerontology supports research to improve the abilities of health care
  practitioners to respond to the diseases and other clinical problems of older people.  The
  Division of Behavioral and Social Research supports research that will lead to greater
  understanding of the social, cultural, economic and psychological factors that affect
  both the process of growing old and the place of older people in society. The Division
  of Neuroscience fosters research concerned with the age-related changes in the nervous
  system as well as the related sensory, perceptual, and cognitive processes associated
  with aging and has a special emphasis on Alzheimer''s disease. Small Business Innovation
  Research (SBIR) program: To expand and improve the SBIR program; to increase private
  sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and development;
  to increase small business participation in Federal research and development; and
  to foster and encourage participation of socially and economically disadvantaged
  small business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in technological
  innovation.  Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program: To stimulate and
  foster scientific and technological innovation through cooperative research development
  carried out between small business concerns and research institutions; to foster
  technology transfer between small business concerns and research institutions; to
  increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research
  and development; and to foster and encourage participation of socially and economically
  disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in
