objective: "Port Security Grant Program (PSGP) is one of four grant programs that\
  \ constitute DHS/FEMA’s focus on transportation infrastructure security activities.\
  \ These grant programs are part of a comprehensive set of measures authorized by\
  \ Congress and implemented by the Administration to help strengthen the nation’s\
  \ critical infrastructure against risks associated with potential terrorist attacks.\
  \ The PSGP provides funds to state, local, and private sector maritime partners\
  \ to support increased port-wide risk management and protect critical surface transportation\
  \ infrastructure from acts of terrorism, major disasters, and other emergencies.\n\
  \nPerformance Measures:\nPerformance metrics for this program are as follows:\n\n\
  •\tProcured equipment placed into services\n•\tThreats/Risks/Vulnerability assessments\
  \ conducted and documented\n•\tEmergency plans developed and documented\n•\tExercises\
  \ executed\n•\tResources/capabilities tested\n•\tAfter/action reports developed\
  \ (post-real-life events and exercise)\n•\tState and local partners trained\n•\t\
  State and local participants coordinate with USCG and Area Maritime Security Committee\
  \ (AMSC)"

- description: 'The PSGP provided $100,000,000 for transportation infrastructure security
    activities to implement Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans (AMSPs) and
    facility security plans among port authorities, facility operators, and state
    and local government agencies required to provide port security services. The
    purpose of the FY 2016 PSGP is to competitively award grant funding to support
    increased port-wide risk management; enhance domain awareness; conduct training
    and exercises; expand of port recovery and resiliency capabilities; further capabilities
    to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks involving improvised
    explosive devices (IEDs) and other non-conventional weapons. These activities
    will assist ports in the implementation of the NPS by supporting the building,
    sustainment, and delivery of core capabilities essential to achieving the Goal
    of a secure and resilient Nation. The PSGP provided $100,000,000 for transportation
