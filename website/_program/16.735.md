- description: Since FY 2011, BJA has made more than 100 competitive grant awards
    to state, local, and tribal jurisdictions across the nation under the PREA Demonstration
    Grant Program. Totaling more than $35 million, these grants are intended to promote
    the implementation of zero tolerance cultures in confinement facilities related
    to sexual abuse and sexual harassment, and to support efforts to achieve compliance
    with the PREA Standards.  BJA anticipates making awards under this program in
    FY 2020 totaling up to $4,500,000. Visit https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/fy2020-prea-grant-impact.pdf

- description: BJA awarded $3.4 million through the FY 2021 Implementing the PREA
    Standards, Protecting Inmates, and Safeguarding Communities Program. This program
    provides funding for projects designed to prevent, detect and respond to sexual
    abuse and sexual harassment in confinement facilities and to achieve and maintain

- description: 'State of the PREA Nation

    Since the first submissions in 2014, there has been an

    upward trend in the number of states and territories

    submitting certifications of full compliance, whereas

    the number of jurisdictions opting to submit neither a

    certification nor an assurance has decreased. The Bureau

    of Justice Assistance’s State PREA Submission website

    provides a map that reflects Governors’ submissions for

    each audit year in a 3-year cycle and links to final PREA

    audit reports on confinement facilities identified by state

    and territorial Governors as under their operational control.

- description: This program has trained over 300 individuals to become certified Department
    of Justice PREA auditors. These auditors have since conducted over 9,000 PREA
    audits of facilities including prisons, jails, juvenile confinement, lockups,
    and community confinement facilities. In addition, this program has funded free
    training and technical assistance to assist confinement agencies and facilities
    to better equip them to comply with the PREA Standards and promote sexually safe
    environments. In FY24, this program created a national training curriculum and
    training on conducting administrative investigations into allegations of sexual
    abuse and sexual harassment that will be provided to every state department of
    corrections in the United States.
