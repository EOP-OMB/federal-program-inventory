    to state, local, and tribal jurisdictions across the nation under the PREA Demonstration
    Grant Program. Totaling more than $35 million, these grants are intended to promote

    FY 2020 totaling up to $4,500,000. Visit https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/fy2020-prea-grant-impact.pdf

    Standards, Protecting Inmates, and Safeguarding Communities Program. This program

- description: 'State of the PREA Nation

    Since the first submissions in 2014, there has been an

    upward trend in the number of states and territories

    submitting certifications of full compliance, whereas

    the number of jurisdictions opting to submit neither a

    certification nor an assurance has decreased. The Bureau

    of Justice Assistance’s State PREA Submission website

    provides a map that reflects Governors’ submissions for

    each audit year in a 3-year cycle and links to final PREA

    audit reports on confinement facilities identified by state

    and territorial Governors as under their operational control.
