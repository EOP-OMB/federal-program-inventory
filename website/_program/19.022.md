objective: To provide assistance awards by U.S. diplomatic missions abroad made directly
  to eligible organizations in the United States using funds appropriated to and authorized
  by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) for the purpose of supporting
  international exchanges that address issues of mutual interest to the United States
  and other countries, consistent with the program criteria established in the Department’s
  annual appropriation. As authorized by the Fulbright-Hays Act, ECA seeks to “increase
  mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other
  countries by means of educational and cultural exchange; to strengthen the ties
  which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural
  interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and
  other nations, and the contributions being made toward a peaceful and more fruitful
  life for people throughout the world; to promote international cooperation for educational
  and cultural advancement; and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic,
  and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the
  world.".
