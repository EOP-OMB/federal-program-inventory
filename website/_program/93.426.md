objective: "This program supports extensive scientific evidence, links nonmedical\
  \ factors, including systemic racism and the lack of economic opportunities, with\
  \ poor health outcomes and increased mortality rates, all of which are preventable.\
  \ Factors such as poverty, inadequate housing, poor health care, and other debilitating\
  \ social conditions, commonly referred to as social determinants of health, contribute\
  \ to long-standing disparities and health inequities.\nThese social conditions contribute\
  \ to the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US population.\
  \ CVD is the leading cause of death in the US; stroke is the 5th leading cause.\
  \  In 2020, about 1 in 5 adults who died from CVD were younger than 65 years old.\
  \ It is estimated that 1 in 9 health care dollars are spent on CVD.   \nCVD mortality\
  \ rates declined for several decades due to both clinical and public health interventions,\
  \ but recently declining death rates from both heart disease and stroke have stalled.\
  \ One reason is that hypertension, the primary risk factor for CVD, is very common\
  \ (1 in 2 US adults has hypertension) but control is not. Only 1 in 4 adults with\
  \ hypertension (26.1%) has it under control.\nGains have been made in treating high\
  \ cholesterol, another primary risk factor for CVD. Overall, the age-adjusted prevalence\
  \ of high cholesterol decreased from 21% to 10% from 1988\u20131994 to 2017\u2013\
  2018.  This improvement is due in part to individuals\u2019 healthy behaviors such\
  \ as eating a healthy diet, losing weight, being physically active, and medication\
  \ adherence, along with clinical contributions from appropriate prescribing and\
  \ intensification of medication. Additional public health and health system interventions\
  \ aimed at preventing, detecting, and controlling elevated cholesterol and blood\
  \ pressure can help to further decrease CVD mortality. \nThis program aims to implement\
  \ and evaluate evidence-based strategies contributing to the prevention and management\
  \ of CVD in populations disproportionately at risk. Given the importance of health\
  \ equity, this program addresses social and economic factors to help communities\
  \ and health systems respond to social determinants present in their communities\
  \ to offer those at risk of or burdened with CVD the best health outcomes possible."
