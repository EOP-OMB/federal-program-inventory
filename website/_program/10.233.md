objective: The FY 2022 consolidated appropriations bill included a general provision
  (Section 757) that requires the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to develop
  a public-private cooperative open framework based on open data standards for neutral
  data repository solutions to preserve and share the big data generated by technological
  advancements in the agriculture industry and for the preservation and curation of
  data in collaboration with land-grant universities. The data framework would eventually
  support development of advanced technologies and practices to meet the increasingly
  complex agricultural challenges of farmers and ranchers.
