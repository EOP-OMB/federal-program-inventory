objective: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Public Law 117-58, established the Small
  Water Storage and Groundwater Grant Program to enhance water storage opportunities.
  It provides up to the lesser of 25 percent, or $30 million, for the cost of planning,
  design, and construction of small water storage projects that, when implemented,
  will increase water supply reliability, improve operational flexibility, and enhance
  climate resiliency of water and related infrastructure throughout the 17 western
  states, Alaska, and Hawaii.
