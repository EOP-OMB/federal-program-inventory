objective: "Goal(s): To provide adult treatment courts and professionals in the criminal\
  \ justice system with the resources needed to plan, implement, enhance, and sustain\
  \ evidence-based treatment court programs for individuals with substance use disorders\
  \ who are involved in the criminal justice system.\n\nObjective(s):  The Bureau\
  \ of Justice Assistance (BJA) funds the Adult Treatment Court program. The Adult\
  \ Treatment Court Program provides financial and technical assistance to states,\
  \ state courts, local courts, units of local government, and federally recognized\
  \ Indian tribal governments to plan and implement a new treatment court or enhance\
  \ the operations of an existing treatment court. These courts effectively integrate\
  \ evidence-based substance use disorder treatment, mandatory drug testing, incentives\
  \ and sanctions, and transitional services in judicially supervised criminal court\
  \ settings that have jurisdiction over individuals with substance use disorder treatment\
  \ needs in order to reduce recidivism and increase their access to treatment and\
  \ recovery support, and to prevent overdoses. \n\n(BJA) Performance Measure 1: Number\
  \ of participants who graduated from the drug court program;\n\n(BJA) Performance\
  \ Measure 2: Percent of participants who graduate from the Treatment Court program;\
  \ and,\n\n(BJA) Performance Measure 3: Percentage of treatment court graduates who\
  \ committed a new criminal offense within 24 months of completing the program. \
  \ \n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) Juvenile\
  \ Drug Treatment Court Program supports treatment and services for youth with substance\
  \ abuse problems. The courts work to strengthen family engagement, address the root\
  \ problems that may cause substance use and addiction, and empower young people\
  \ to lead drug-free and crime-free lives. The Family Drug Court Program serves parents\
  \ and guardians who require treatment for a substance abuse disorder and who are\
  \ involved with the child welfare system as a result of child abuse or neglect.\
  \ Program goals are to strengthen parenting skills, to reduce incidents of child\
  \ abuse and neglect resulting from addiction, and to provide services to the children\
  \ affected. The Tribal Juvenile Healing to Wellness Courts enhances the capacity\
  \ of tribal courts to respond to the substance use challenges of court-involved\
  \ youth. The courts employ culturally informed approaches to promote accountability,\
  \ healing, and tribal identity in youth younger than age 21.\n\nObjective: OJJDP\u2019\
  s Juvenile Drug Court, Family Drug Court and Juvenile Tribal Healing to Wellness\
  \ Court programs implement new and innovative approaches to enhance existing or\
  \ establish new courts.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Percentage of eligible individuals\
  \ who abstained from or reduced substance misuse\n(OJJDP Overall); and, \nPerformance\
