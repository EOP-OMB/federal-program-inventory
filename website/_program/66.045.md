objective: Title XI, Section 71101 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (or
  The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or (BIL), Public Law 117-58 amended section 741
  of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16091) to authorize EPAâ€™S Clean School
  Bus (CSB) Program to award grants, contracts, and rebates for the replacement of
  existing school buses with clean school buses and zero-emission school buses. BIL
  appropriates $ 5 billion for the program over five Federal fiscal years (FY 22-26).
  The objective of this assistance is, to the maximum extent practicable, achieve
  nationwide deployment of clean school buses and zero-emission school buses and to
  ensure a broad geographic distribution of awards. The CSB Program will fund the
  replacement of existing school buses with cleaner buses that result in better air
  quality on the bus, in bus loading areas, and throughout the communities in which
  they operate. The Clean School Bus Program works to reduce pollution emitted from
  existing school buses by replacing them with low and zero-emission school buses.
  Priority is given to projects which propose to replace buses that serve high-need
  local education agencies; rural school districts; Bureau of Indian Affairs-funded
  school districts; and school districts receiving basic support payments for children
  who reside on Indian land.
