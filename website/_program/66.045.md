objective: 'Title XI, Section 71101 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
  (or The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or (BIL), Public Law 117-58 amended section
  741 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16091) to authorize EPAâ€™S Clean
  School Bus Program to award grants, contracts, and rebates for the replacement of
  existing school buses with clean school buses and zero-emission school buses. BIL
  appropriates $ 5 billion for the program over five Federal fiscal years (FY 22-26).
  The objective of this assistance is, to the maximum extent practicable, achieve
  nationwide deployment of clean school buses and zero-emission school buses and to
  ensure a broad geographic distribution of awards. The CSB Program will fund the
  replacement of existing school buses with cleaner buses that result in better air
  quality on the bus, in bus loading areas, and throughout the communities in which
  they operate.


  Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2023: The Clean School Bus Program works to reduce
  pollution emitted from existing school buses by replacing them with low and zero-emission
  school buses. Priority will be given to projects which propose to replace buses
  that serve high-need local education agencies; rural school districts; Bureau of
  Indian Affairs-funded school districts; and school districts receiving basic support
  payments for children who reside on Indian land. Further priority will be given
  to applicants that leverage additional external funds to support project activities.
  In addition, evaluation points may be given to projects which result in outcomes
  that benefit affected communities, those that engage local communities with respect
  to the design and performance of the project, those that serve Ozone or PM2.5 nonattainment
  or maintenance areas, those that demonstrate that project results and benefits are
  sustainable and can be continued after project completion, and those that demonstrate
  a plan to prepare the workforce for the project. For FY2023, projects will be funded
  under the 2023 CSB Grants Notice of Funding Opportunity.'
