objective: The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
  (ONC) has created the Public Health Informatics & Technology (PHIT) Workforce Development
  Program. This program aims to increase the number of public health professionals
  trained in informatics and technology, with an emphasis on improving public health
  reporting through modern standards and computing. ONC anticipates awarding $75 million
  to train individuals to help modernize the nation’s public health data infrastructure,
  with a focus on recruiting participants from minority serving institutions (MSIs).
  MSIs will receive funding priority for this opportunity. Through an interdisciplinary
  approach to data science and managing public health information, the program will
  build capacity of MSIs to educate and diversify the public health workforce of the
  future.
