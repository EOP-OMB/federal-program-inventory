objective: The purpose of the Heritage Partnership Program funding is to carry out
  programs and projects that engage NHA recipients, partners, communities, and/or
  visitors in shared environmental stewardship.  It promotes greater public and private
  participation in preservation, conservation, education, and outdoor recreation programs
  and activities, and builds resource stewardship ethics in is participants.  Goals
  for each National Heritage Area are set forth in each of their designation legislation,
  but in general, the goal of designation as a National Heritage Area is to preserve
  and interpret for the educational and inspirational benefit of present and future
  generations the unique and significant contributions to our national heritage.  This
  heritage is shown through certain historic and cultural lands, waterways, and structures.
  By preserving and interpreting this heritage, NHAs are able to encourage a broad
  range of economic opportunities enhancing the quality of life within the designated
  area, and provide a management framework to assist state/local government entities,
  non-profits, and others in developing policies and programs that will preserve,
  enhance, and interpret the cultural, historical, natural, recreation, and scenic
  resources of the heritage area.
