objective: The purpose of the Heritage Partnership Program funding is to carry out
  programs and projects that engage National Heritage Area (NHA) recipients, partners,
  communities, and/or visitors in shared environmental stewardship.  It promotes greater
  public and private participation in preservation, conservation, education, and outdoor
  recreation programs and activities, and builds resource stewardship ethics in is
  participants.  Goals for each National Heritage Area are set forth in each of their
  designation legislation, but in general, the goal of designation as a National Heritage
  Area is to preserve and interpret for the educational and inspirational benefit
  of present and future generations the unique and significant contributions to our
  national heritage.  This heritage is shown through certain historic and cultural
  lands, waterways, and structures. By preserving and interpreting this heritage,
  NHAs are able to encourage a broad range of economic opportunities enhancing the
  quality of life within the designated area, and provide a management framework to
  assist state/local government entities, non-profits, and others in developing policies
  and programs that will preserve, enhance, and interpret the cultural, historical,
  natural, recreation, and scenic resources of the heritage area.
