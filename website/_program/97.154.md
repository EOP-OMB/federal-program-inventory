objective: The Office of Citizenship, Partnership and Engagement (OCPE), within US.
  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
  is charged with promoting instruction and training on the rights and responsibilities
  of citizenship. USCIS recognizes that naturalization is a key milestone in the civic
  integration of immigrants. Naturalization requirements, such as knowledge of English
  and of U.S. history and civics, encourage civic learning and build a strong foundation
  upon which immigrants can fully integrate into society. Through preparing for naturalization,
  immigrants will gain the tools to become successful citizens and meet their responsibilities
  as United States citizens. The goal of the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program
  is to expand the availability of high-quality citizenship preparation services for
  lawful permanent residents (LPRs) across the nation and to provide opportunities
  for lawful permanent residents to gain the knowledge and training necessary to integrate
  into the fabric of American society. The Citizenship and Integration Grant Program
  supports the objectives of Executive Order 14012, Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration
  Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans, by
  promoting integration, inclusion, and citizenship. Furthermore, the goals of the
  Citizenship and Integration Grant Program address the DHS mission to enforce and
  administer our immigration laws as stated in the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security
  Review as the program provides lawful permanent residents instruction on the rights
  and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship and information and support on how to apply
  for naturalization within the authorized practice of immigration law.
