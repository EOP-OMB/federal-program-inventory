objective: 'The purpose of the Metropolitan Transportation Planning and State and
  Non-Metropolitan Planning and Research is to assist in development of metropolitan
  and state transportation improvement programs, long-range transportation plans,
  and other technical studies in a program for a unified and officially coordinated
  Statewide Transportation system and Metropolitan Transportation system(s) within
  the state.  As a result of this coordinated effort, the former CFDA# 20.515 was
  discontinued several years ago.  This CFDA incorporates both the Statewide Transportation
  system and the Metropolitan Transportation system into one Assistance Listings (AL).

  Also included in this AL, is the Areas of Persistent Poverty (AoPP) program. The
  Areas of Persistent Poverty program is a discretionary grant that assist applicants
  in areas of persistent poverty in planning, engineering or development of technical
  or financing plans for projects eligible under Chapter 53 of title 49 USC. The AoPP
  program has not received fiscal year funding for 2024  as of yet.  However, FTA
  will maintain the overview of the program in the FY23 Assistance Listings update
  and will re-evaluate in during the FY24 annual AL data request.'

    Transportation Planning and State and Non-Metropolitan Planning and Research.
    The funds provide assistance for  multimodal transportation planning in metropolitan
    areas and states that is cooperative, continuous and comprehensive, resulting
    in long-range plans and short-range programs of transportation investment priorities.   Planning
    funds are also used to develop or update 410 Metropolitan Transportation Improvement
    Programs, 52 State Transportation Improvement Programs, approximately 410 Unified
    Planning Work Programs, and 52 State Planning and Research Work Programs.  Specific
