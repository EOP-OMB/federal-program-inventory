objective: 'The purpose of the Metropolitan Transportation Planning and State and
  Non-Metropolitan Planning and Research is to assist in development of metropolitan
  and state transportation improvement programs, long-range transportation plans,
  and other technical studies in a program for a unified and officially coordinated
  Statewide Transportation system and Metropolitan Transportation system(s) within
  the state.  As a result of this coordinated effort, the former CFDA# 20.515 was
  discontinued several years ago.  This CFDA incorporates both the Statewide Transportation
  system and the Metropolitan Transportation system into one Assistance Listings (AL).

  Also included in this AL, is the Areas of Persistent Poverty (AoPP) program. The
  Areas of Persistent Poverty program is a discretionary grant that assist applicants
  in areas of persistent poverty in planning, engineering or development of technical
  or financing plans for projects eligible under Chapter 53 of title 49 USC. The AoPP
  program has not received fiscal year funding for 2024  as of yet.  However, FTA
  will maintain the overview of the program in the FY23 Assistance Listings update
  and will re-evaluate in during the FY24 annual AL data request.'
