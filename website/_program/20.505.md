objective: The purpose of the Metropolitan Transportation Planning and State and Non-Metropolitan
  Planning and Research is to assist in development of metropolitan and state transportation
  improvement programs, long-range transportation plans, and other technical studies
  in a program for a unified and officially coordinated Statewide Transportation system
  and Metropolitan Transportation system(s) within the state.  As a result of this
  coordinated effort, the former CFDA# 20.515 was discontinued several years ago.  This
  CFDA incorporates both the Statewide Transportation system and the Metropolitan
  Transportation system into one Assistance Listings (AL).
