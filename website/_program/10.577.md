- description: 'In August 2015, FNS completed the National Accuracy Clearinghouse
    (NAC) pilot project in conjunction with OMBâ€™s Partnership for Program Integrity
    and Innovation and a consortium of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.  The
    pilot project tested a data clearinghouse that allowed States to conduct a real-time
    check of whether a SNAP applicant was receiving benefits in another pilot State.  The
    NAC reduced duplicate participation in all five States.  Not all cases of duplicate
    participation are determined to be fraud; however, all cases of duplicate participation
    can lead to an overpayment claim.  Duplicate participation rates were low between
    pilot States.  Not all States were able to obtain the same level of automation
    to support the system.  The pilot demonstrated results in lowering instances of
    duplicate participation and in providing cost savings by preventing duplicate
    participation before it occurs. '

- description: FNS awarded LDP grants to 14 States from FY21 to FY23; Congress did
    not fund the LDP grants for FY24. Nine of the LDP grantee states have completed
    MOUs and have delivered SNAP state administrative records to the Census Bureau
    to support longitudinal research on SNAP, and four others have draft agreements
    to do so.
