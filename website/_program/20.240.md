  and enforcement efforts among public agencies to reduce Federal and State fuel tax
  evasion. Funds made available shall be used only to expand or enhance intergovernmental
  efforts to increase motor fuel tax enforcement and payments; to supplement motor
  fuel tax examinations and criminal investigations; and to increase research and
  training in the area of fuel tax evasion. This program is part of the Highway Use
  Tax Evasion program which also may provide funds to the Internal Revenue Service
  (IRS) for their efforts as outlined in 23 U.S.C. 143.

    including enhancements to data systems. Funds have not been awarded for FY 2015
    and 2016 as of May 2017.  However, prior awards are still used to support training,
    and a few individual projects in the States.  These may include enforcement programs,
    and enhancements to data systems.  '

- description: 'Funds will likely also be used to expand auditing and tracking programs,
    including enhancements to data systems. When diesel fuel leaves the bulk terminal,
    fuel to be used in a non-taxable fashion (off-highway use) is injected with a
    red dye. At both the Federal and State level, fuel taxes are not imposed on dyed
    fuel. Many States have enforcement initiatives where vehicles are randomly checked
    for the presence of red dye in the fuel. Several of the awards will likely be
    used to start or enhance existing programs in testing for dyed fuel. '
