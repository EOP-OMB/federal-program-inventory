objective: The housing choice voucher program is the federal government's major program
  for assisting very low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled to afford
  decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market. Since housing assistance
  is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants are able to find
  their own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The
  participant is free to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program
  and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects. The program
  serves the most economically vulnerable families in the country, including families
  with disabilities, elderly families, formerly homeless veterans, and families with
  children, through federal assistance voucher payments in the provision of meeting
  their rental housing needs. HUD regulations merged the former Section 8 Rental Voucher
  program (14.855) with the former Section 8 Certificate program (14.857). Section
  502 of the Public Housing Reform Act states that a purpose of the legislation is
  "consolidating the voucher and certificate programs for rental assistance under
  Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the "USHA") into a single market-driven
  program that will assist in making tenant-based rental assistance more successful
  at helping low-income families obtain affordable housing and will increase housing
  choice for low-income families". The HCVP is administered by local public housing
  agencies (PHAs) authorized under State law to operate housing programs within an
  area or jurisdiction. The PHAs receive federal funds from the U.S. Department of
  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to administer the voucher program. The PHA accepts
  a family’s application for rental assistance, selects the applicant family for admission,
  and issues the selected family a voucher confirming the family’s eligibility for
  assistance. The family must then find and lease a dwelling unit suitable to the
  family’s needs and desires in the private rental market. The PHAs sign Housing Assistant
  Payment contracts with the landlords, and housing subsidy is paid to the landlord
  directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating family. The family then pays
  the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized
  by the program. Under certain circumstances, if authorized by the PHA, a family
  may use its voucher to purchase a modest home.

- description: 'The HCV program has proven to be effective at meeting the housing
    needs of our most vulnerable citizens compared to other approaches. For example,
    in October 2016, HUD published the results of the Family Options Study. Launched
    in 2008, the study’s goal was to determine which housing and services interventions
    work best for families with children experiencing homelessness. Reports published
    in July 2015 and October 2016 presented evidence regarding the effects of giving
    families in emergency shelters priority access to housing choice vouchers, rapid
    re­housing, or project-based transitional housing. The study team followed the
    families for 3 years and measured outcomes in five domains of family well-being:
    (1) housing stability, (2) family preservation, (3) adult well-being, (4) child
    well-being, and (5) self-sufficiency. The study determined that the HCV program
    was the most effective intervention of the approaches tested. HCV intervention
    reduced most forms of residential instability by more than one half, reduced food
    insecurity, and improved multiple measures of adult and child well-being.'
