objective: "The housing choice voucher program is the federal government's major program\
  \ for assisting very low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled to afford\
  \ decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market. Since housing assistance\
  \ is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants are able to find\
  \ their own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The\
  \ participant is free to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program\
  \ and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects. The program\
  \ serves the most economically vulnerable families in the country, including families\
  \ with disabilities, elderly families, formerly homeless veterans, and families\
  \ with children, through federal assistance voucher payments in the provision of\
  \ meeting their rental housing needs. HUD regulations merged the former Section\
  \ 8 Rental Voucher program (14.855) with the former Section 8 Certificate program\
  \ (14.857). Section 502 of the Public Housing Reform Act states that a purpose of\
  \ the legislation is \"consolidating the voucher and certificate programs for rental\
  \ assistance under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the \"USHA\"\
  ) into a single market-driven program that will assist in making tenant-based rental\
  \ assistance more successful at helping low-income families obtain affordable housing\
  \ and will increase housing choice for low-income families\". The HCVP is administered\
  \ by local public housing agencies (PHAs) authorized under State law to operate\
  \ housing programs within an area or jurisdiction. The PHAs receive federal funds\
  \ from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to administer\
  \ the voucher program. The PHA accepts a family\u2019s application for rental assistance,\
  \ selects the applicant family for admission, and issues the selected family a voucher\
  \ confirming the family\u2019s eligibility for assistance. The family must then\
  \ find and lease a dwelling unit suitable to the family\u2019s needs and desires\
  \ in the private rental market. The PHAs sign Housing Assistant Payment contracts\
  \ with the landlords, and housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the\
  \ PHA on behalf of the participating family. The family then pays the difference\
  \ between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the\
  \ program. Under certain circumstances, if authorized by the PHA, a family may use\
  \ its voucher to purchase a modest home."
