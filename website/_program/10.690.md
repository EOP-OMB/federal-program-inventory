objective: "To make annual payments to the governing bodies of each of the political\
  \ subdivisions (including public utilities) located in the Lake Tahoe Basin to be\
  \ used primarily for erosion control and water quality projects.  The goal of the\
  \ program is to provide federal assistance to address urban stormwater runoff pollution,\
  \ the primary source of pollutants (fine sediment and nutrients) affecting the clarity\
  \ of Lake Tahoe.  This program addresses urban runoff from public roads and right\
  \ of ways.\r\n\r\nTo fund a competitive grant award program for research projects\
  \ high in technical merit and relevant to land management and regulatory agencies\
  \ working in the Tahoe Basin. The goal of the program is to promote applied, timely,\
  \ relevant research that addresses natural resource management needs in the basin.\
  \ Research funded through this program addresses key management questions, includes\
  \ input from agencies, produces decision-support tools that are useful and accessible,\
  \ fosters collaboration and communication, builds on previous research, and ultimately\
  \ addresses the science needs identified in the Lake Tahoe Environmental Improvement\
  \ Program. The environmental goals of the Lake Tahoe Environmental Improvement Program\
  \ are defined using thresholds that were established to protect the natural environment\
  \ and maintain public health and safety within the basin. The threshold categories\
  \ are: 1) water quality, 2) wildlife, 3) soil conservation, 4) scenic resources,\
  \ 5) air quality, 6) recreation, 7) vegetation, 8) noise, and 9) fisheries. "
