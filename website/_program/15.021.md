  Tribal communities by providing greater flexibility in planning programs and meeting
  the needs of communities.  This program allows Tribes to combine various programs

  program accountability by reducing paperwork and reporting requirements, and reduce
  Tribal administrative costs to allow for increased services under these contracts.
