objective: The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures.
  In contrast, under current law personal expenditures for medical care (including
  the costs of prescription drugs) exceeding 7.5 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted
  gross income are deductible. For tax years beginning after 2012, only medical expenditures
  exceeding 10 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income are deductible. However,
  for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, if either the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s
  spouse turned 65 before the end of the taxable year, the threshold remained at 7.5
  percent of adjusted income. Beginning in 2017, the 10 percent threshold applied
  to all taxpayers, including those over 65.
