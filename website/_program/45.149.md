objective: "Preservation and Access grants ensure the long-term and wide availability\
  \ of primary resources in the humanities by funding projects that promote preserving\
  \ and providing intellectual access to resources held in libraries, museums, archives,\
  \ historical organizations, and other collections that are important for research,\
  \ education, and public programming in the humanities. The Humanities Collections\
  \ and Reference Resources program supports the digitization and description of humanities\
  \ collections to make their content widely accessible and the creation of reference\
  \ resources to facilitate the use of cultural materials. The National Digital Newspaper\
  \ Program supports a national digital resource of historically significant newspapers.\
  \ The Cultural and Community Resilience program supports community-based efforts\
  \ to mitigate climate change, safeguard cultural resources, and foster cultural\
  \ resilience. Dynamic Language Infrastructure \u2013 Documenting Endangered Languages\
  \ Senior Research Grants, a partnership between NEH and the National Science Foundation,\
  \ supports the documentation of at-risk languages. Preservation Assistance Grants\
  \ help small and mid-sized institutions improve their ability to preserve and care\
  \ for their humanities collections. The Sustaining Cultural Heritage Collections\
  \ program supports environmentally sustainable preventive care measures that preserve\
  \ collections, reduce energy consumption and costs, and strengthen resiliency to\
  \ disasters. Preservation and Access Education and Training supports educational\
  \ programs for professionals who preserve and provide access to humanities collections.\
  \ The Research and Development program supports projects that address major challenges\
  \ in preserving or providing access to humanities collections and resources."
