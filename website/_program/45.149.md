objective: Preservation and Access grants ensure the long-term and wide availability
  of primary resources in the humanities by funding projects that promote preserving
  and providing intellectual access to resources held in libraries, museums, archives,
  historical organizations, and other collections that are important for research,
  education, and public programming in the humanities. The Humanities Collections
  and Reference Resources program supports the digitization and description of humanities
  collections to make their content widely accessible and the creation of reference
  resources to facilitate the use of cultural materials. The National Digital Newspaper
  Program supports a national digital resource of historically significant newspapers.
  The Cultural and Community Resilience program supports community-based efforts to
  mitigate climate change, safeguard cultural resources, and foster cultural resilience.
  Dynamic Language Infrastructure – Documenting Endangered Languages Senior Research
  Grants, a partnership between NEH and the National Science Foundation, supports
  the documentation of at-risk languages. Preservation Assistance Grants help small
  and mid-sized institutions improve their ability to preserve and care for their
  humanities collections. The Sustaining Cultural Heritage Collections program supports
  environmentally sustainable preventive care measures that preserve collections,
  reduce energy consumption and costs, and strengthen resiliency to disasters. Preservation
  and Access Education and Training supports educational programs for professionals
  who preserve and provide access to humanities collections. The Research and Development
  program supports projects that address major challenges in preserving or providing
  access to humanities collections and resources.
