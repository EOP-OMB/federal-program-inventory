objective: The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular
  tax rate schedule. It would not allow deductions and exemptions or preferentially
  low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast,
  the Tax Code allowed taxpayers to deduct up to $15 million per production ($20 million
  in certain distressed areas) in non-capital expenditures incurred during the year.
  This provision is scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.
