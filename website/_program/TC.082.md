objective: Under a comprehensive economic income tax, the costs of acquiring machinery
  and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline
  in the propertyâ€™s economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This ensures
  that the net income from the property is measured appropriately each year. Current
  law allows depreciation deductions that are accelerated relative to economic depreciation.
  In particular, in 2023, 80 percent of the purchase cost of qualified property is
  eligible to be expensed immediately; this percentage phases out to zero through
  2027. Additionally, subject to investment limitations, the Tax Code allows up to
  $1 million (indexed for inflation) in qualifying investments in tangible property
  and certain computer software to be expensed rather than depreciated over time.
  The depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference tax law, and
  thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference tax law. Under the normal
  tax baseline, in contrast, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic
  depreciation.
