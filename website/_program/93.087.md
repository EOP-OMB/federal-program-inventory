    The RPG grant program is in its 7th round of funding, to date there have been
    127 projects in 40 states and 613 counties. The program supports interagency collaborations
    and integration of evidence-based and evidence-informed programs, services, and
    activities. Results from previous RPG projects demonstrate that the majority of
    children at risk of removal remained in their parentâ€™s custody following enrollment
    into RPG services.  Among youth who were in an out-of-home placement, the rates
    of placement into permanent settings, including reunification with their parent(s),
    increased significantly in the year following RPG enrollment. In addition, the
    overall rates of child maltreatment decreased substantially in the year after
    enrollment in the RPG program.  A legislatively required cross site evaluation
    is a part of the RPG program, additional information and findings can be found
    here (https://rpg-cse.acf.hhs.gov/ )including Reports to Congress.'
