objective: "The goal and mission of the NDPC is to enable communities to address specific\
  \ evolving and emerging threats and hazards and close capability gaps through development\
  \ and delivery of learning solutions that strengthen the nation’s preparedness.\
  \ FEMA and NDPC members work together to address long-term trends that impact national\
  \ preparedness - including rising disaster costs, new technology, an older and more\
  \ diverse population, and emerging threats. The NDPC program objectives are:\n\n\
  •\tIdentify, develop, test, and deliver training to the SLTT emergency management\
  \ and emergency response workforce, and provide on-site and mobile training at the\
  \ performance and management and planning levels. \n•\tSupport FEMA strategic priorities\
  \ to instill equity as a foundation of emergency management and lead whole of community\
  \ climate resilience; and \n•\tAnalyze and address current and emerging capability\
  \ gaps and risks identified in the 2023 National Preparedness Report.  \n\nFEMA\
  \ is committed to reducing complexity, increasing efficiency, and improving outcomes.\
  \ In simple terms, the training return on investment (ROI) is expressed as the benefit\
  \ to cost ratio for individuals, teams, departments, jurisdictions, and regions\
  \ across the nation to reach and maintain fully qualified/mission capable status.\
  \ In practice, training ROI is difficult to measure. The cost of training varies\
  \ significantly depending upon several variables including delivery format (i.e.,\
  \ online, indirect/train-the-trainer, mobile, resident/on-campus) and competency\
  \ level (i.e., awareness, performance/operations, management). FEMA uses a systematic\
  \ approach to optimize the national preparedness training portfolio, align resources\
  \ to address capability gaps through the most effective and efficient means available,\
  \ and ensure a sound ROI from the local to the national level. Collaboration with\
  \ FEMA’s training partners is integral to that effort."
