objective: 'To produce geologic maps of areas in which knowledge of geology is important
  to the economic, social, or scientific welfare of individual States. StateMap supports:
  (1) projects which produce new geologic maps with attendant explanatory information
  including correlation of map units, description of map units and symbols, stratigraphic
  columns, geologic sections, and other pertinent information; and (2) projects which
  compile existing geologic data in a digital form for inclusion in the National Digital
  Geologic Map Database. EdMap: Provide funding for undergraduate and graduate students
  in academic research programs, through cooperative agreements, that involve geologic
  mapping and scientific data analysis as major components; expand research and educational
  capacity of graduate programs that teach earth science students the techniques of
  geologic mapping and field data analysis; and facilitate the publication and distribution
  of geologic maps generated in field-based graduate academic research programs. '
