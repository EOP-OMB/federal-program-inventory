objective: 'Bureau support under this program includes select support to unique programs
  of international organizations and to a lesser extent, the multiregional activities
  of non-governmental organizations assisting refugees, stateless persons, conflict-affected,
  and vulnerable migrants.  A particular emphasis of this support is to promote initiatives
  in areas that are cross-cutting Bureau priorities, such as: humanitarian protection;
  addressing specific needs based on gender, age, and disability; preventing and responding
  to gender-based violence (including protection from sexual exploitation, abuse,
  and harassment); addressing statelessness; promoting localization; improving refugee
  health; and advancing the use of data and evidence in humanitarian assistance.'
