objective: Bureau support under this program includes mostly contributions to the
  headquarters and global program costs of the United Nations High Commissioner for
  Refugees (UNHCR), the headquarters budget of the International Committee of the
  Red Cross (ICRC) and to a smaller extent, the multiregional activities of other
  international and non-governmental organizations assisting refugees and other conflict
  victims.  A particular emphasis of this support is to promote initiatives in areas
  that are cross-cutting, Bureau priorities, such as protecting refugee women and
  refugee children, preventing and responding to gender-based violence (including
  sexual exploitation), addressing statelessness, enhancing refugee protection, improving
  refugee health, including HIV/AIDS prevention and response, and advancing the use
  of standards and evidence in humanitarian assistance.
