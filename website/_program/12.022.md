- description: In fiscal year 2024 the program added five new Defense Agencies that
    have established Mentor-Protege Programs (MPP), under the DoD Office of Small
    Business (OSBP) which will expand the entrance of socially and economically disadvantage
    businesses into the program which in turn will increase the partnerships within
    the Defense supplier base.   These additions resulted in 3 newly awarded Mentor-Protege
    Agreements.  Additionally, enhancements have been made to the Mentor-Protege Program
    portal improving the mentor application process through user friendly functionality
    this resulted in 20 new mentors into the Program.  Lastly, the development and
    implementation of a standard operating procedure manual was completed.  The manual
    will ensure alignment of program management and execution of all Mentor-Protege
    agreements and programs established under the DoD OSBP MPP.
