objective: EPA is providing grants to States, Locals, Federally Recognized Indian
  Tribal Governments, Native American Organizations, and U.S. Territories and possessions
  for the planning of and development of ambitious climate action and air pollution
  reduction plans and to implement measures from those plans. These grants are provided
  under Section 60114 of the Inflation Reduction Act, Climate Pollution Reduction
  Grants, 42 U.S. Code § 7437 (or Public Law 117–169, title VI, Aug. 16, 2022, 136
  Stat. 2076), which amended the Clean Air Act (CAA) by creating Section 137 for Greenhouse
  Gas Air Pollution Plans and Implementation Grants. Section 137 of CAA authorizes
  the EPA to fund climate pollution planning grants and climate pollution implementation
  grants to states, air pollution control agencies, municipalities, tribes, or a group
  of two or more of these entities. Specifically, the CPRG grant program provides
  funding of $250 million for planning grants to eligible entities to develop ambitious
  climate action and air pollution reduction plans and approximately $4.6 billion
  to implement projects from those plans.  The Climate Pollution Reduction Grants—Planning
  Grants grant program aims to prioritize awarding 100 percent of available FY2023
  planning grant funding to eligible entities to initiate development of climate action
  plans, which will involve, among other things, conducting stakeholder outreach and
  meaningful engagement with low income and disadvantaged communities. Once completed,
  these plans will establish greenhouse gas reduction targets and lay out a roadmap
  for expeditious implementation of investment-ready policies, programs, and projects
  to reduce GHG emissions.
