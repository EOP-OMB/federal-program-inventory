objective: "EPA is providing grants to States, Locals, Federally Recognized Indian\
  \ Tribal Governments, Native American Organizations, and U.S. Territories and possessions\
  \ for the planning of and development of ambitious climate action and air pollution\
  \ reduction plans and to implement measures from those plans. These grants are provided\
  \ under Section 60114 of the Inflation Reduction Act, Climate Pollution Reduction\
  \ Grants, 42 U.S. Code \xA7 7437 (or Public Law 117\u2013169, title VI, Aug. 16,\
  \ 2022, 136 Stat. 2076), which amended the Clean Air Act (CAA) by creating Section\
  \ 137 for Greenhouse Gas Air Pollution Plans and Implementation Grants. Section\
  \ 137 of CAA authorizes the EPA to fund climate pollution planning grants and climate\
  \ pollution implementation grants to states, air pollution control agencies, municipalities,\
  \ tribes, or a group of two or more of these entities. Specifically, the CPRG grant\
  \ program provides funding of $250 million for planning grants to eligible entities\
  \ to develop ambitious climate action and air pollution reduction plans and approximately\
  \ $4.6 billion to implement projects from those plans.  The Climate Pollution Reduction\
  \ Grants\u2014Planning Grants grant program aims to prioritize awarding 100 percent\
  \ of available FY2023 planning grant funding to eligible entities to initiate development\
  \ of climate action plans, which will involve, among other things, conducting stakeholder\
  \ outreach and meaningful engagement with low income and disadvantaged communities.\
  \ Once completed, these plans will establish greenhouse gas reduction targets and\
  \ lay out a roadmap for expeditious implementation of investment-ready policies,\
  \ programs, and projects to reduce GHG emissions."
