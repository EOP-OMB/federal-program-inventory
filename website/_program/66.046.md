objective: EPA is providing grants to States, Locals, Federally Recognized Indian
  Tribal Governments, Native American Organizations, and U.S. Territories and possessions
  for the planning of and development of ambitious climate action and air pollution
  reduction plans and to implement measures from those plans. These grants are provided
  under Section 60114 of the Inflation Reduction Act, Climate Pollution Reduction
  Grants, 42 U.S. Code § 7437 (or Public Law 117–169, title VI, Aug. 16, 2022, 136
  Stat. 2076), which amended the Clean Air Act (CAA) by creating Section 137 for Greenhouse
  Gas Air Pollution Plans and Implementation Grants. Section 137 of CAA authorizes
  the EPA to fund climate pollution planning grants and climate pollution implementation
  grants to states, air pollution control agencies, municipalities, tribes, or a group
  of two or more of these entities. Specifically, the CPRG grant program provides
  funding of $250 million for planning grants to eligible entities to develop ambitious
  climate action and air pollution reduction plans and approximately $4.6 billion
  to implement projects from those plans. Once completed, these plans will establish
  greenhouse gas reduction targets and lay out a roadmap for expeditious implementation
  of investment-ready policies, programs, and projects to reduce GHG emissions.

- description: 'In FY2024, EPA completed awarding planning grants to states, municipalities,
    Tribes and territories. In March/April 2024, planning grantees submitted their
    first deliverable for the planning grants, the Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP).
    EPA reviewed and published these PCAPs here: https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/priority-climate-action-plans-states-msas-tribes-and-territories

    Furthermore, EPA initiated the process for planning grantees to complete their
    second deliverable under the planning grants, the Comprehensive Climate Action
    Plans. These plans are due December 2025. EPA held a workshop with planning grantees
    in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in September 2024 to provide guidance and training
    for completing these climate action plans.'
