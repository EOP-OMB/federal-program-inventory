objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. However, the Tax Code allows an income
  tax credit for biodiesel and for biodiesel derived from virgin sources. In lieu
  of the biodiesel credit, the taxpayer can claim a refundable excise tax credit.
  In addition, small agri-biodiesel producers are eligible for a separate income tax
  credit for biodiesel production, and a separate credit is available for qualified
  renewable diesel fuel mixtures. This provision expires on December 31, 2024.
