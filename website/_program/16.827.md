objective: "Goal:\nUnder the enacted appropriations language, the Justice Reinvestment\
  \ Initiative (JRI), helps states identify and respond to crime and other public\
  \ safety problems, explore evidence-based or innovative and cost-saving strategies,\
  \ and to invest in strategies that can decrease crime and reduce recidivism.\n\n\
  Objective:\nThe Justice Reinvestment Initiative currently funds several streams\
  \ of work:  \n\n1) State-based JRI training and technical assistance supports states\u2019\
  \ justice system stakeholders and policy leaders as they devise and implement data-driven\
  \ approaches to reduce crime and recidivism, including operationalizing data results\
  \ to reduce violent crime and supporting state and local agencies in their efforts\
  \ to do the same. Under the JRI model, a governmental working group with bipartisan\
  \ and inter-branch representation analyzes the crime, recidivism, and corrections\
  \ data, and its associated costs, then develops cost-effective policy and practice\
  \ options, and implements and measures those changes.\n\n2) Site-based grant awards\
  \ are made under the \u201CJustice Reinvestment: Reducing Crime by Improving Justice\
  \ System Performance\u201D grant program, which allows eligible applicants to apply\
  \ for funding to develop and implement innovative and research-based responses that\
  \ address a range of criminal justice system problems. Successful applicants are\
  \ expected to follow the five-step JRI process to meet their objectives: engage\
  \ stakeholders; analyze data and the current landscape; develop a plan, procedures,\
  \ and strategies; implement responses; and measure outcomes. \n\n3. \u201CJustice\
  \ Counts\u201D is a JRI-funded program that provides resources and support to state\
  \ and local criminal justice agencies to bolster the use of data in policymaking\
  \ and operational decision-making. The program employs a collaborative approach\
  \ to develop consensus-driven metrics, a web-based platform for agencies to share\
  \ their data in line with those metrics, and other associated tools and resources.\
  \  \n\n4. The Corrections Data Analysts program provides correctional agencies with\
  \ much-needed analytical capacity and resources to enhance their ability to use\
  \ data to drive decision-making. The program includes the development of national,\
  \ virtual academies to facilitate the training and continuing educations of correctional\
  \ data analysts as well as a resident corrections analysts program in which funded\
  \ researchers and analysts will work closely with state correctional leaders to\
  \ produce needed analyses.   \n\n5. \u201CThe Price of Justice: Rethinking the Consequences\
  \ of Fines and Fees\u201D program works in partnership with state, local, and tribal\
  \ agencies to address the use of fines and fees and ensure they are being used in\
  \ a constitutional and nondiscriminatory way. The purpose of this program is to\
  \ address common barriers to creating a more equitable justice system by addressing\
  \ how agencies use and apply fines and fees.\nPerformance Measure 1:  Number of\
  \ jurisdictions that have received technical assistance through JRI; and,  \n\n\
  Performance Measure 2:  Number of policies and practices developed through JRI that\
  \ have been codified in statute or changed through administrative policy (e.g.,\
  \ regulations, adoption of certain policies, guidelines, or procedures)."
