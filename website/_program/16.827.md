objective: "Goal:\nUnder the enacted appropriations language, the Justice Reinvestment\
  \ Initiative (JRI), helps states identify and respond to crime and other public\
  \ safety problems, explore evidence-based or innovative and cost-saving strategies,\
  \ and to invest in strategies that can decrease crime and reduce recidivism.\n\n\
  Objective:\nThe Justice Reinvestment Initiative currently funds several streams\
  \ of work:  \n\n1) State-based JRI training and technical assistance supports states’\
  \ justice system stakeholders and policy leaders as they devise and implement data-driven\
  \ approaches to reduce crime and recidivism, including operationalizing data results\
  \ to reduce violent crime and supporting state and local agencies in their efforts\
  \ to do the same. Under the JRI model, a governmental working group with bipartisan\
  \ and inter-branch representation analyzes the crime, recidivism, and corrections\
  \ data, and its associated costs, then develops cost-effective policy and practice\
  \ options, and implements and measures those changes.\n\n2) Site-based grant awards\
  \ are made under the “Justice Reinvestment: Reducing Crime by Improving Justice\
  \ System Performance” grant program, which allows eligible applicants to apply for\
  \ funding to develop and implement innovative and research-based responses that\
  \ address a range of criminal justice system problems. Successful applicants are\
  \ expected to follow the five-step JRI process to meet their objectives: engage\
  \ stakeholders; analyze data and the current landscape; develop a plan, procedures,\
  \ and strategies; implement responses; and measure outcomes. \n\n3. “Justice Counts”\
  \ is a JRI-funded program that provides resources and support to state and local\
  \ criminal justice agencies to bolster the use of data in policymaking and operational\
  \ decision-making. The program employs a collaborative approach to develop consensus-driven\
  \ metrics, a web-based platform for agencies to share their data in line with those\
  \ metrics, and other associated tools and resources.  \n\n4. The Corrections Data\
  \ Analysts program provides correctional agencies with much-needed analytical capacity\
  \ and resources to enhance their ability to use data to drive decision-making. The\
  \ program includes the development of national, virtual academies to facilitate\
  \ the training and continuing educations of correctional data analysts as well as\
  \ a resident corrections analysts program in which funded researchers and analysts\
  \ will work closely with state correctional leaders to produce needed analyses.\
  \   \n\n5. “The Price of Justice: Rethinking the Consequences of Fines and Fees”\
  \ program works in partnership with state, local, and tribal agencies to address\
  \ the use of fines and fees and ensure they are being used in a constitutional and\
  \ nondiscriminatory way. The purpose of this program is to address common barriers\
  \ to creating a more equitable justice system by addressing how agencies use and\
  \ apply fines and fees.\nPerformance Measure 1:  Number of jurisdictions that have\
  \ received technical assistance through JRI; and,  \n\nPerformance Measure 2:  Number\
  \ of policies and practices developed through JRI that have been codified in statute\
  \ or changed through administrative policy (e.g., regulations, adoption of certain\
  \ policies, guidelines, or procedures)."

  year: '2018'
- description: "As of October 2018, 30 states have engaged in JRI. All but three states\
    \ implementing reforms (a total of 18 states enacted legislation prior to 2014)\
    \ have achieved or exceeded their goals in safely avoiding prison growth, and\
    \ nine have experienced reductions in their prison populations. Simultaneously,\
    \ crime rates have decreased in 18 states concurrent with various policy changes.\
    \ \n\nIn addition, 12 states have reported savings ranging from $2.5 to $491 million,\
    \ totaling $1.1 billion across all states reporting savings; and 22 states have\
    \ invested a total of $551 million through FY 2017."

- description: 'BJA awarded nearly $5.9 million under the Justice Reinvestment Initiative:  Reducing
    Crime by Improving Justice System Performance, which helps jurisdictions develop
    and implement innovative and research-based responses that address a range of
    criminal justice system problems designed to ensure a fair and efficient justice
    system, facilitate appropriate sentencing and treatment, and protect community
    security.

    BJA awarded $11.8 million under the Justice Reinvestment Initiative:  State-level
    Training and Technical Assistance Program, which will fund training and technical
    assistance providers to help states implement data-driven strategies to improve
    public safety by reducing corrections spending and reinvesting those savings in
    efforts to decrease crime and strengthen neighborhoods.'

  year: '2022'
- description: JRI uses a data-driven process to help states achieve fairer, effective,
    and efficient criminal justice systems. Since 2007, 44 states, including more
    than 30 using federal dollars, have used JRI to assess pressing challenges, and
    develop and implement corresponding policy changes. JRI’s flexible, tailored,
    and data-driven approach results in policies that are customized to address the
    unique challenges faced by each state and the structure and dynamics within their
    criminal justice systems. Since the program’s inception, JRI policies are estimated
    to have eliminated over $3 billion in corrections costs, reinvested over $650
    million into strategies that improve outcomes, and averted prison population growth
    by nearly 70,000 people across the nation. JRI policies have helped states and
    localities achieve better public safety outcomes through investments in system
    improvements.
