objective: "The Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) currently funds the following\
  \ three programs under the Domestic Victims of Human Trafficking (DVHT) Program.\n\
  \nIn FY 23, under the DVHT Program model, OTIP funded the Domestic Victims of Human\
  \ Trafficking- Services and Outreach (DVHT-SO) Program and the Victims of Human\
  \ Trafficking in Native Communities (VHT-NC) Demonstration Program.  Under the DVHT-SO\
  \ Program, the following activities are required: 1) Provide comprehensive, culturally\
  \ responsive, and linguistically appropriate case management and victim assistance\
  \ to domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking and 2) Conduct\
  \ outreach to increase identification of domestic individuals who have experienced\
  \ sex and/or labor trafficking. Under the VHT-NC Program, the following activities\
  \ are required: 1) Provision of comprehensive, culturally responsive, and linguistically\
  \ appropriate case management and victim assistance to adult and minor Native American\
  \ victims of human trafficking; 2) Outreach efforts to increase identification of\
  \ Native American victims of sex and labor trafficking; and 3) Training for service\
  \ providers and community partners.  Both the DVHT-SO Program and the VHT-NC Program\
  \ are informed by a whole family approach that focuses equally and intentionally\
  \ on services and opportunities for victims and their immediate family members living\
  \ within their households. Both programs encourage the establishment of community\
  \ partnerships, meaningful engagement of survivors, and the hiring of qualified\
  \ professionals who reflect the communities being served in all project implementation\
  \ strategies.   \n\nAdditionally, in FY 23, OTIP funded the Human Trafficking Youth\
  \ Prevention Education (HTYPE) Demonstration Program. The primary purpose of the\
  \ HTYPE Demonstration Program is to fund local educational agencies (LEA) to develop\
  \ and implement programs to prevent human trafficking victimization through the\
  \ provision of skills-based human trafficking training and education for school\
  \ staff and students. The HTYPE Demonstration Program will fund LEAs to establish\
  \ a cohesive strategy, with the support of a partnered nonprofit or nongovernmental\
  \ organization (NGO), to build the capacity to provide all aspects of human trafficking\
  \ prevention education to students and school staff.\n\nBeginning September 30,\
  \ 2023, OTIP will fund three new cohorts of the DVHT-SO Program, VHT-NC Program,\
  \ and HTYPE."
