objective: "The Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) currently funds the following\
  \ three programs under the Domestic Victims of Human Trafficking (DVHT) Program.\n\
  \nIn FY 24, under the DVHT Program model, OTIP funded the Domestic Victims of Human\
  \ Trafficking- Services and Outreach (DVHT-SO) Program and the Victims of Human\
  \ Trafficking in Native Communities (VHT-NC) Demonstration Program.  Under the DVHT-SO\
  \ Program, the following activities are required: 1) Provide comprehensive, culturally\
  \ responsive, and linguistically appropriate case management and victim assistance\
  \ to domestic individuals who have experienced human trafficking and 2) Conduct\
  \ outreach to increase identification of domestic individuals who have experienced\
  \ sex and/or labor trafficking. Under the VHT-NC Program, the following activities\
  \ are required: 1) Provision of comprehensive, culturally responsive, and linguistically\
  \ appropriate case management and victim assistance to adult and minor Native American\
  \ victims of human trafficking; 2) Outreach efforts to increase identification of\
  \ Native American victims of sex and labor trafficking; and 3) Conduct public awareness\
  \ activities for the local community and organizations that may encounter individuals\
  \ who have experienced human trafficking. Both the DVHT-SO Program and the VHT-NC\
  \ Program are informed by a whole family approach that focuses equally and intentionally\
  \ on services and opportunities for victims and their immediate family members living\
  \ within their households. Both programs encourage the establishment of community\
  \ partnerships, meaningful engagement of survivors, and the hiring of qualified\
  \ professionals who reflect the communities being served in all project implementation\
  \ strategies.   \n\nAdditionally, in FY 23, OTIP funded the Human Trafficking Youth\
  \ Prevention Education (HTYPE) Demonstration Program. The primary purpose of the\
  \ HTYPE Demonstration Program is to fund local educational agencies (LEA) to develop\
  \ and implement programs to prevent human trafficking victimization through the\
  \ provision of skills-based human trafficking training and education for school\
  \ staff and students. The HTYPE Demonstration Program will fund LEAs to establish\
  \ a cohesive strategy, with the support of a partnered nonprofit or nongovernmental\
  \ organization (NGO), to build the capacity to provide all aspects of human trafficking\
  \ prevention education to students and school staff.\n\nAs of November 30, 2023,\
  \ OTIP is currently funding three new cohorts of the DVHT-SO Program, VHT-NC Program,\
  \ and HTYPE."

- description: 'OTIP has continued its commitment by providing significant funding
    for 5 DVHT-SO grant recipients for FY24. This funding will support local organizations
    across four states: California, Seattle, Oregon, and New Jersey. These newly funded
    cohort have collaborated with community partners and expanded targeted canvassing
    in their outreach approach by connecting local faith-based organizations, urgent
    care centers, and local jails to conduct screening and build referrals.


    In March 2024, OTIP provided training and technical assistance (T/TA) through
    the National Human Trafficking Training and Technical Assistance Center (NHTTAC)
    to FY 22 DVHT-SO cohorts. The purpose of the meeting was to strategize best practices
    for outreach to potential new clients and to identify the technical assistance
    needed for the upcoming year. The meeting also allowed recipients to collaborate,
    engage with each other, and participate in team building and peer-to-peer learning.

    VHT-NC continues to be a critical source of funding for Native American and Indigenous
    survivors of human trafficking who may otherwise be unable to secure housing.


    Through the HTYPE program, one recipient translated their curricula materials
    into Spanish to be more inclusive of their newcomer student population.'
