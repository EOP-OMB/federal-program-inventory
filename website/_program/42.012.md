objective: The Connecting Communities Digital Initiative (CCDI) encourages creators
  in Black, Indigenous, and communities of color to combine Library materials with
  technology to connect Americans with a more expansive understanding of our past
  and future. CCDI Grants encourage digital programs that add and amplify the stories
  of people whose voices have traditionally been minimized, and innovatively incorporate
  Library collections.
