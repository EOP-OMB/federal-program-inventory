objective: NOAA/NWS also provides funding to external research partners to support
  the Unified Forecast System (UFS).  The UFS is designed to provide more accurate
  forecast guidance through operational numerical weather prediction capabilities.
  Projects that advance the UFS development are awarded to support the goals of the
  Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) program, the Weeks 3-4 Program,
  and the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program (HFIP). The Collaborative Science,
  Technology, and Applied Research (CSTAR) program from NOAA/NWS provides funding
  to the university community for collaborative applied meteorological research to
  create a cost-effective transition from basic and applied research to operations
  and services.
