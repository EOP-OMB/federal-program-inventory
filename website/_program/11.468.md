- description: 'Projects awarded through the CSTAR program will lead to a deeper understanding
    of meteorological factors involved in the NWS warning and forecasting programs,
    which in turn, will benefit the U.S. public with more responsive warning and forecast
    programs. The MSI program will engage in studies seeking to improve estimation
    of quantitative precipitation estimation used in hydrologic forecasts with algorithms
    derived from satellite data. Alert warning systems are being implemented in remote
    areas as a result of the ALERT program. Projects awarded through the CSTAR, HFIP,
    and NGGPS programs will lead to a deeper understanding of meteorological factors
    involved in the NWS warning and forecasting programs, which in turn, will benefit
    the U.S. public with more responsive warning and forecast programs. '
