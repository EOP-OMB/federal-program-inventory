objective: NOAA/NWS also provides funding to external research partners to support
  the Unified Forecast System (UFS).  The UFS is designed to provide more accurate
  forecast guidance through operational numerical weather prediction capabilities.
  Projects that advance the UFS development are awarded to support the goals of the
  Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) program, the Weeks 3-4 Program,
  and the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program (HFIP). The Collaborative Science,
  Technology, and Applied Research (CSTAR) program from NOAA/NWS provides funding
  to the university community for collaborative applied meteorological research to
  create a cost-effective transition from basic and applied research to operations
  and services.

- description: 'Projects awarded through the CSTAR program will lead to a deeper understanding
    of meteorological factors involved in the NWS warning and forecasting programs,
    which in turn, will benefit the U.S. public with more responsive warning and forecast
    programs. The MSI program will engage in studies seeking to improve estimation
    of quantitative precipitation estimation used in hydrologic forecasts with algorithms
    derived from satellite data. Alert warning systems are being implemented in remote
    areas as a result of the ALERT program. Projects awarded through the CSTAR, HFIP,
    and NGGPS programs will lead to a deeper understanding of meteorological factors
    involved in the NWS warning and forecasting programs, which in turn, will benefit
    the U.S. public with more responsive warning and forecast programs. '
