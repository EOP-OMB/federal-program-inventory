objective: "The Office of Research and Development\u2019s (ORD) Consolidated Research/Training/Fellowships\
  \ program supports research and development to: (1) determine the environmental\
  \ effects of air quality, drinking water, water quality, climate change, hazardous\
  \ waste, toxic substances, and pesticides; (2) identify, develop, and demonstrate\
  \ effective pollution control techniques to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution;\
  \ (3) support risk assessments to characterize the potential adverse health effects\
  \ of human exposures to environmental hazards; and (4) facilitate training and program\
  \ participant support in these areas. This program may also implement special Congressionally\
  \ directed projects or programs identified in EPA's annual appropriations act or\
  \ committee reports incorporated by reference into the annual appropriation act.\
  \ Awards made under this program further EPA\u2019s priorities supporting robust\
  \ science for air, climate, and energy; safe and sustainable water resources; sustainable\
  \ and healthy communities; chemical safety; and health and environmental risk assessment.\
  \  \n\nFunding Priority - Fiscal Year 2023: ORD's research supports EPA's strategic\
  \ goals. Brief descriptions of this research are as follows:  \n\n1) Air, climate,\
  \ and energy research that assesses human and ecosystem exposures and effects associated\
  \ with air pollution and the consequences of climate change; 2) Safe and sustainable\
  \ water resources research that provides resource management tools allowing decision\
  \ makers to systematically consider complex tradeoffs occurring in a watershed on\
  \ a regional or national scale, including development of innovative, cost-effective\
  \ solutions to current, emerging, and long-term water resource challenges for complex\
  \ chemical and biological contaminants, as well as supporting safe and adequate\
  \ supplies of water; 3) Sustainable and healthy communities research that supports\
  \ the Agency's efforts to protect and restore the land, and support community health;\
  \ 4) Chemical safety research that underpins the analysis of risks and potential\
  \ health impacts across the broad spectrum of EPA programs and provides the scientific\
  \ foundation for pesticide and toxic substances programs, pollution prevention,\
  \ human health risk assessment, and homeland security, leading to improved science-based\
  \ approaches that build broader understanding of biology, chemical toxicity, and\
  \ exposure; and 5) Health and environmental risk assessment research focusing on\
  \ the science of assessments that inform Agency, state, and tribal decisions and\
  \ policies. These risk assessments provide the research and technical support needed\
  \ to ensure safety of chemicals in the marketplace. Undergraduate, graduate, and\
  \ post-doctoral training and program participant support in the areas referenced\
  \ above (may include: air pollution; water quality; managing chemical risks; aquatic\
  \ toxicology and ecology; pollution prevention and green chemistry; biological,\
  \ physical and chemical remediation; sustainability and resilience; ecosystems research;\
  \ climate change, cumulative impacts; environmental research of watersheds, drinking\
  \ water and wastewater; nonpoint source pollution; and invasive species). National\
  \ priorities research focusing on water quality and availability. May support congressionally\
  \ directed projects or programs identified in EPA's annual appropriations act or\
  \ explanatory statements/committee reports incorporated by reference into the annual\
  \ appropriation act. Please check the EPA website: https://www.epa.gov/research-grants\
  \ for an updated listing of all solicitations."
