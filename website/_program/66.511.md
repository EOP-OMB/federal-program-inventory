objective: "The Office of Research and Development’s (ORD) Consolidated Research/Training/Fellowships\
  \ program supports research and development to: (1) determine the environmental\
  \ effects of air quality, drinking water, water quality, climate change, hazardous\
  \ waste, toxic substances, and pesticides; (2) identify, develop, and demonstrate\
  \ effective pollution control techniques to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution;\
  \ (3) support risk assessments to characterize the potential adverse health effects\
  \ of human exposures to environmental hazards; and (4) facilitate training and program\
  \ participant support in these areas. This program may also implement special Congressionally\
  \ directed projects or programs identified in EPA's annual appropriations act or\
  \ committee reports incorporated by reference into the annual appropriation act.\
  \ Awards made under this program further EPA’s priorities supporting robust science\
  \ for air, climate, and energy; safe and sustainable water resources; sustainable\
  \ and healthy communities; chemical safety; and health and environmental risk assessment.\
