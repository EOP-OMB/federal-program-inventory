- description: A university received FSMIP funding to identify best practices for
    sustaining profitable relationships between local producers and restaurants. The
    project developed strategies for verifying local purchasing and evaluated consumer
    willingness to pay for locally produced foods, thereby improving economic opportunities
    for farmers and strengthening rural economies. FSMIP has also provided grants
    to promote the domestic maple syrup industry by funding research and education
    projects related to production, sustainability, and marketing of maple products.
    For example, $5.1 million was issued to projects aimed at improving consumer knowledge
    and producer practices within the maple syrup sector. FSMIP has also funded various
    projects to explore innovative approaches to marketing U.S. food and agricultural
    products, thereby improving the efficiency and performance of the marketing system.
    These initiatives have addressed barriers and opportunities in marketing, transportation,
    and distribution, benefiting diverse stakeholders and strengthening local economies.
    Overall, these accomplishments demonstrate FSMIP's commitment to fostering innovation
    and efficiency in agricultural marketing, ultimately benefiting producers and
    consumers alike.
