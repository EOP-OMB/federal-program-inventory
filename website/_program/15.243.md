objective: 'BLM’s continued commitment to reduce and streamline its processes and
  procedures to serve its customers and the public better and faster across all its
  program areas. These reforms allow the Bureau to realign time and resources to completing
  important on–the-groundwork.

  This program continues to advance the Administration’s priorities to create a conservation
  stewardship legacy while generating revenue and utilizing our natural resources.
  BLM’s continued commitment to reduce and streamline its processes and procedures
  to serve its customers and the public better and faster across all its program areas.
  These reforms allow the Bureau to realign time and resources to completing important
  on–the-ground work to utilize qualified youth or conservation corps to carry out
  appropriate conservation projects on public lands, cooperatively with the BLM on
  cultural and natural resource related conservation projects such as trail development
  and maintenance, historic, cultural, forest and timber management, minor construction
  work, archaeological conservation, and native plant habitat restoration and rehabilitation.
  Promote and stimulate public purposes such as education, job training, development
  of responsible citizenship, productive community involvement, and further the understanding
  and appreciation of natural and cultural resources through the involvement of youth
  and young adults in the care and enhancement of public resources. Continue the longstanding
  efforts of the BLM to provide opportunities for public service, youth employment,
  minority youth development and training, and participation of young adults in accomplishing
  conservation-related work.  This program also supports the Infrastructure Investment
  and Jobs Act (IIJA) Public Law 117-58, Sec. 40804(b) Ecosystem Restoration and Section
  40803 Wildfire Risk Reduction. Executive Order (E.O) 14008: The American Climate
