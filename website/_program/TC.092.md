objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. However, the Tax Code allowed eligible taxpayers to
  claim a credit equal to the lesser of 50 percent of maintenance expenditures and
  the product of $3,500 and the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased.
  This provision applies to maintenance expenditures in taxable years beginning before
  January 1, 2017.
