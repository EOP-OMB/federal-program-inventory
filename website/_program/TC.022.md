objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all
  returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code provides a credit
  for certain electricity produced from wind energy, biomass, geothermal energy, solar
  energy, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, or qualified hydropower and
  sold to an unrelated party. Facilities that begin construction in 2017 receive 80
  percent of the credit, facilities that begin construction in 2018 receive 60 percent
  of the credit, facilities that begin construction in 2019 receive 40 percent of
  the credit, and facilities that begin construction in 2020 or 2021 receive 60 percent
  of the credit. The full credit amount is available for projects that begin construction
  after 2021, but the full rate is dependent on prevailing wage and apprenticeship
  requirements. Two additional bonus credits worth 10 percent each are available for
  projects that meet domestic content requirements and projects located in energy
  communities. Starting in 2025, the credit becomes a technology neutral credit, and
  it begins to phase out as early as 2034.
