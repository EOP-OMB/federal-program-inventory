objective: The purpose of this program is to build resilience in the meat and poultry
  supply chain by increasing processing capacity and promoting more competition in
  the sector. This program is designed to support the expansion and diversification
  of meat and poultry processing capacity to help increase processor income; provide
  producers an opportunity to have ownership in processing facilities; create stable,
  well-paying jobs in rural regions; raise the bar on worker health, safety, training,
  and wages for meatpacking jobs; spur collaboration among producers and workers;
  prompt state, tribal, and private co-investment; and provide consumers with more
  product choices.
