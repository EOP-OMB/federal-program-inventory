- description: The QSP is a small but impactful program that is used extensively by
    the U.S. wheat, tree fruit and nuts, hides, rice, seafood, livestock genetics,
    and soybean industries to demonstrate the quality of their U.S. commodities and
    reach new potential target markets.  Program participants often use QSP in conjunction
    with the other FAS market development programs to leverage the impact of the samples
    to spur interest in their products.
