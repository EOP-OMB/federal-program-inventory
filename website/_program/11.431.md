objective: Climate variability and change present society with significant economic,
  health, safety, and security challenges. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
  (NOAA) has the vision, mission and a set of strategic goals to build a Climate Ready-Nation.
  The Climate Program Office (CPO) supports this vision as part of the Office of Oceanic
  and Atmospheric Research (OAR). A CPO core function is to support extramural research
  through a competitive grants process. CPO’s programs span foundational, cross-disciplinary
  climate sciences, assessments, capacity building, tool development, and education.
  CPO collaborates closely with partners within NOAA and with the broader academic,
  Federal, Tribal nations, international bodies, and private sector community. CPO
  works in close partnership with the OAR laboratories and programs to complement
  and support their in-house research. CPO also works with other parts of NOAA to
  support their mission areas in weather, oceans, fisheries, and service delivery.
  CPO further builds networks, coalitions, and collaborations, converges around the
  best ideas, and provides support to accelerate emerging innovation across the climate
  enterprise. Undertaking a range of climate science and services initiatives, CPO
  helps our Nation and the world address climate-related challenges and pursue solution-focused
  opportunities. CPO’s definition of climate services is comprehensive, encompassing
  not only the development and dissemination of actionable climate science to inform
  decision making, but also the partnerships to engage in and understand the social
  and policy contexts within which climate-relevant decisions are made. CPO fulfills
  NOAA’s mandated responsibilities under the National Climate Program Act, the Global
  Change Research Act and its National Climate Assessment, and the National Integrated
  Drought Information System Act, and similar international endeavors such as the
  World Climate Research Program.
