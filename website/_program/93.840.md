objective: 'The Center for Translation Research and Implementation Science (CTRIS)
  supports the conduct of pragmatic trials which identify the best strategies for
  ensuring successful integration of evidence-based interventions within clinical
  and public health settings, such as health centers, worksites, communities, and
  schools in the United States and abroad. Trials may use qualitative, quantitative,
  and/or mixed methods approaches. Mixed methods—also known as multi-methods—involve
  the integration of quantitative and qualitative data collection and analytical approaches
  into a single study or program of inquiry to generate new knowledge. It can include
  either concurrent or sequential use of these two classes of methods to follow a
  line of inquiry. Pragmatic trials constitute a cornerstone of late-stage T4 translation
  research process. They are unlike explanatory trials that confirm a physiological
  or clinical hypothesis and form the pillars of the earlier stages of the translational
  research spectrum. Rather, pragmatic trials are designed to generate the knowledge
  needed for the adoption of interventions, already proven to be effective in explanatory
  trials, into real-world clinical practice and community settings.  This research
  helps to turn discoveries into improved health.  Programs support the biomedical
  research workforce and career development and research dissemination including training
  of early-stage scientists and established investigators to conduct late-stage translation
  phase (T4) and implementation science research in heart, lung, and blood diseases
  and sleep disorders and research education. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
  program: To stimulate technological innovation; use small business to meet Federal
  research and development needs; foster and encourage participation in innovation
  and entrepreneurship by socially and economically disadvantaged persons; and increase
  private-sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and
  development funding related to late-stage translation phase (T4) , including implementation
  science, research education, and research dissemination products, for both domestic
  and global health. Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program: To stimulate
  technological innovation; foster technology transfer through cooperative R&D between
  small businesses and research institutions, and increase private sector commercialization
  of innovations derived from federal R&D to late-stage translation phase (T4) research
  including implementation science, research education, and research dissemination
  products for both domestic and global health.'
