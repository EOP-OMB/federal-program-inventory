objective: "The Center for Translation Research and Implementation Science (CTRIS)\
  \ plans, fosters, and supports late-stage research to identify promising approaches\
  \ for ensuring successful integration of evidence and evidence-based interventions\
  \ within clinical and public health settings, such as health centers, worksites,\
  \ schools, and communities in the United States and abroad. These approaches build\
  \ on the successes in fundamental discovery science and early-stage translational\
  \ research to ensure findings achieve maximal benefit for people and their communities.\
  \ They also will help tackle new challenges in late-stage T4 translation research—the\
  \ phase in the translational research pathway that leads to general knowledge about\
  \ implementing evidence and evidence-based interventions—that helps turn discoveries\
  \ into improved health. \n\nCTRIS is the strategic focal point within NHLBI to catalyze\
  \ opportunities for rigorous dissemination and implementation research to advance\
  \ the creation, evaluation, reporting, dissemination, sustained adoption, spread,\
  \ and scale of evidence-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of\
  \ heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. CTRIS is charged with integrating the\
  \ domain expertise found in all NHLBI organizational units and leveraging the NIH-wide\
  \ investments in dissemination and implementation research to accomplish its mission."
