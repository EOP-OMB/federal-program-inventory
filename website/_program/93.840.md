objective: "The Center for Translation Research and Implementation Science (CTRIS)\
  \ supports the conduct of pragmatic trials which identify the best strategies for\
  \ ensuring successful integration of evidence-based interventions within clinical\
  \ and public health settings, such as health centers, worksites, communities, and\
  \ schools in the United States and abroad. Trials may use qualitative, quantitative,\
  \ and/or mixed methods approaches. Mixed methods\u2014also known as multi-methods\u2014\
  involve the integration of quantitative and qualitative data collection and analytical\
  \ approaches into a single study or program of inquiry to generate new knowledge.\
  \ It can include either concurrent or sequential use of these two classes of methods\
  \ to follow a line of inquiry. Pragmatic trials constitute a cornerstone of late-stage\
  \ T4 translation research process. They are unlike explanatory trials that confirm\
  \ a physiological or clinical hypothesis and form the pillars of the earlier stages\
  \ of the translational research spectrum. Rather, pragmatic trials are designed\
  \ to generate the knowledge needed for the adoption of interventions, already proven\
  \ to be effective in explanatory trials, into real-world clinical practice and community\
  \ settings.  This research helps to turn discoveries into improved health.  Programs\
  \ support the biomedical research workforce and career development and research\
  \ dissemination including training of early-stage scientists and established investigators\
  \ to conduct late-stage translation phase (T4) and implementation science research\
  \ in heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders and research education.\
  \ Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program: To stimulate technological\
  \ innovation; use small business to meet Federal research and development needs;\
  \ foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by socially\
  \ and economically disadvantaged persons; and increase private-sector commercialization\
  \ of innovations derived from Federal research and development funding related to\
  \ late-stage translation phase (T4) , including implementation science, research\
  \ education, and research dissemination products, for both domestic and global health.\
  \ Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program: To stimulate technological\
  \ innovation; foster technology transfer through cooperative R&D between small businesses\
  \ and research institutions, and increase private sector commercialization of innovations\
  \ derived from federal R&D to late-stage translation phase (T4) research including\
  \ implementation science, research education, and research dissemination products\
  \ for both domestic and global health."
