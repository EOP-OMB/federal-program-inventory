objective: The baseline tax system limits to $3,000 the write-off of losses from capital
  assets, with carryover of the excess to future years. In contrast, the Tax Code
  allows up to $100,000 in losses from the sale of small business corporate stock
  (capitalization less than $1 million) to be treated as ordinary losses and fully
  deducted.
