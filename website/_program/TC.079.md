objective: Under a comprehensive economic income tax, the costs of acquiring a building
  are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the
  propertyâ€™s economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This ensures that
  the net income from the property is measured appropriately each year. Current law
  allows depreciation deductions that differ from those under economic depreciation.
  However, the depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference tax
  law, and thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference tax law. Under
  normal tax baseline, in contrast, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic
  depreciation.
