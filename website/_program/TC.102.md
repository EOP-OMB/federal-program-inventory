objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities,
  investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code provides employers located
  in certain presidentially declared disaster areas during the years 2017 through
  2020 a 40 percent credit for up to $6,000 in wages paid to each eligible employee
  while the business was inoperable as a result of the disaster. Only wages paid after
  the disaster occurred and within 150 days of the last day of the incident period
  are eligible for the credit. Employers must reduce their deduction for wages paid
  by the amount of the credit claimed.
