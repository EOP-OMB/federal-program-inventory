objective: This program will provide funds to states and territories to support entities
  engaged in the middle of the supply chain activities with the goal of expanding
  capacity for “non-meat and poultry” sectors. States will work in partnership with
  USDA to make competitive subawards to support infrastructure in the middle-of-the-supply-chain
  for domestic food and farm businesses and other eligible entities. States may use
  a limited portion of funds to develop and/or strengthen the State’s supply chain
  coordination and targeted market development services for local and regional produced
  product. States will submit State Plans to develop and administer coordinated initiatives
  to build resilience across the middle-of-the-food-supply-chain in their state. Funds
  will support expanded capacity for the aggregation, processing, manufacturing, storing,
  transporting, wholesaling, and distribution of locally and regionally produced food
  products, including specialty crops, dairy, grains for human consumption, aquaculture,
  and other food products, excluding meat and poultry.

- description: "•\tIn May 2023, USDA announced the availability of up to $420 million\
    \ through RFSI to strengthen local and regional food systems. Through this program,\
    \ AMS has entered into non-competitive cooperative agreements with state agencies,\
    \ commissions, or departments responsible for agriculture, commercial food processing,\
    \ seafood, or food system and distribution activities or commerce activities in\
    \ states or U.S. territories. All participating states and territories will offer\
    \ competitive Infrastructure Grant requests for subaward applications, as specified\
    \ by USDA’s program requirements. \nIn 2024, 48 states submitted their subaward\
    \ packages to AMS for review for RFSI program alignment and NEPA approval.  Fourteen\
    \ states have completed the subaward review and approval process and are moving\
    \ forward with awards. The remaining states are working through the review process.\
    \  Examples from approved state subaward activities include:\n-\tConnecticut Department\
    \ of Agriculture: awarded over $670,000 for three projects through the Resilient\
    \ Food Systems Infrastructure Program (RFSI) to build resilience across the middle\
    \ of the supply chain and strengthen local and regional food systems.  Funded\
    \ programs will enhance aggregation and distribution of fluid milk and value-added\
    \ dairy, shared processing and cold-storage facilities and other middle-of-the-supply-chain\
    \ activities.\n-\tIdaho Department of Agriculture: awarded $5.5 million for 27\
    \ projects through the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program (RFSI) to\
    \ build resilience across the middle of the supply chain and strengthen local\
    \ and regional food systems.  Funded programs will help increase regional distribution\
    \ capacity, establish value added processing through commercial kitchens, modernize\
    \ processing capacity through equipment upgrades and other middle-of-the-supply-chain\
    \ activities.\n-\tKansas Department of Agriculture: awarded $5.6 million for 49\
    \ projects through the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program (RFSI) to\
    \ build resilience across the middle of the supply chain and strengthen local\
    \ and regional food systems.  Funded programs will help establish value added\
    \ processing in commercial kitchens to increase production capacity while meeting\
    \ regulatory requirements for food processing and safety, develop regional food\
    \ hubs and distribution routes, increase in processing capacity through equipment\
    \ upgrades, and other middle-of-the-supply-chain activities.\n-\tNebraska Department\
    \ of Agriculture: awarded over $2.5 million for 15 projects through the Resilient\
    \ Food Systems Infrastructure Program (RFSI) to build resilience across the middle\
    \ of the supply chain and strengthen local and regional food systems.  Funded\
    \ programs will help increase processing, cold storage, and transportation to\
    \ wholesale and direct-to-consumer markets, establish a shared-use wash, pack,\
    \ and processing facility, support facility expansion and equipment purchases\
    \ to help tribal farmers scale up their year-round food production and processing,\
    \ and other middle-of-the-supply-chain activities."
