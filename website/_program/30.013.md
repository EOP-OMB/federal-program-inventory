objective: "Title II of GINA prohibits the use of genetic information in making employment\
  \ decisions, restricts employers and other entities covered by Title II (employment\
  \ agencies, labor organizations and joint labor-management training and apprenticeship\
  \ programs) from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information, and strictly\
  \ limits the disclosure of genetic information.  Title II of GINA also prohibits\
  \ retaliation against applicants or employees for filing a charge of discrimination,\
  \ participating in a discrimination proceeding (such as a discrimination investigation\
  \ or lawsuit), or reasonably opposing discrimination. Genetic information includes\
  \ information about an individual\u2019s genetic tests and the genetic tests of\
  \ an individual\u2019s family members, as well as information about the manifestation\
  \ of a disease or disorder in an individual\u2019s family members (i.e. family medical\
  \ history). Genetic information also includes an individual's request for, or receipt\
  \ of, genetic services, or the participation in clinical research that includes\
  \ genetic services by the individual or a family member of the individual, and the\
  \ genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or by a pregnant woman\
  \ who is a family member of the individual and the genetic information of any embryo\
  \ legally held by the individual or family member using an assisted reproductive\
  \ technology."
