objective: 'The purpose of this funding is to assist with the implementation of the
  “Executive Order on Safe Policing for Safe Communities,” signed by President Trump
  on June 16, 2020.  The goal is to maintain and expand the National Decertification
  Index (NDI) database.  The objective of the NDI Database is to coordinate the sharing
  of information between and among Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial
  law enforcement agencies concerning instances of excessive use of force related
  to law enforcement matters, accounting for applicable privacy and due process rights.
  The NDI is a national registry of certificate or license revocation actions relating
  to officer misconduct. The Executive Order states that the database described in
  Section 3(a) and 3(b) of the Order shall include a mechanism to track, as permissible,
  terminations or de-certifications of law enforcement officers, criminal convictions
  of law enforcement officers for on-duty conduct, and civil judgments against law
  enforcement officers for improper use of force.  The database described in Section
  3(a) shall also account for instances where a law enforcement officer resigns or
  retires while under active investigation related to the use of force.  The database
  should consist only of instances in which law enforcement officers were afforded
  fair process.


  Performance Measure 1:  Number of files states have submitted for the inclusion
  to the NDI database and what percentage over the previous year submissions;


  Performance Measure 2: Percentage of agencies that submit files and conduct searches
  in NDI; and,


  Performance Measure 3: Percentage of requesting agencies who rated services as satisfactory
  or better.'
