objective: "The purpose of this funding is to assist with the implementation of the\
  \ \u201CExecutive Order on Safe Policing for Safe Communities,\u201D signed by President\
  \ Trump on June 16, 2020.  The goal is to maintain and expand the National Decertification\
  \ Index (NDI) database.  The objective of the NDI Database is to coordinate the\
  \ sharing of information between and among Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial\
  \ law enforcement agencies concerning instances of excessive use of force related\
  \ to law enforcement matters, accounting for applicable privacy and due process\
  \ rights. The NDI is a national registry of certificate or license revocation actions\
  \ relating to officer misconduct. The Executive Order states that the database described\
  \ in Section 3(a) and 3(b) of the Order shall include a mechanism to track, as permissible,\
  \ terminations or de-certifications of law enforcement officers, criminal convictions\
  \ of law enforcement officers for on-duty conduct, and civil judgments against law\
  \ enforcement officers for improper use of force.  The database described in Section\
  \ 3(a) shall also account for instances where a law enforcement officer resigns\
  \ or retires while under active investigation related to the use of force.  The\
  \ database should consist only of instances in which law enforcement officers were\
  \ afforded fair process.\n\nPerformance Measure 1:  Number of files states have\
  \ submitted for the inclusion to the NDI database and what percentage over the previous\
  \ year submissions;\n\nPerformance Measure 2: Percentage of agencies that submit\
  \ files and conduct searches in NDI; and,\n\nPerformance Measure 3: Percentage of\
  \ requesting agencies who rated services as satisfactory or better."
