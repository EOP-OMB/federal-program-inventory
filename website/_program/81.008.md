objective: The Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER)
  enhances the security and resilience of U.S. critical energy infrastructure from
  all hazards, mitigate the impacts of disruptive events and risk to the sector overall.  CESERâ€™s
  Risk Management Tools and Technologies (RMT) division is responsible for research,
  development, and demonstration (RD&D) of new tools and technologies that address
  risks to U.S. energy infrastructure. These tools and technologies address risks
  from cybersecurity and physical threats, electromagnetic pulse (EMP), geomagnetic
  disturbances (GMD), and natural hazards such as wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding.
  The intended outcome of CESER RMT projects is next generation tools and technologies
  that provide energy sector protection, monitoring, detection, response, containment,
  and recovery capabilities. These efforts are primarily executed through competitive
  solicitations.
