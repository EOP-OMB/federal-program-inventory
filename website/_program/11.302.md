objective: "Through the Planning program, EDA provides assistance to eligible recipients\
  \ to create regional economic development plans in order to stimulate and guide\
  \ the economic development efforts of a community or region.  As part of this program,\
  \ EDA supports Partnership Planning investments to facilitate the development, implementation,\
  \ revision, or replacement of Comprehensive Economic Development Strategies (CEDS),\
  \ which leverage the unique assets of their respective regions to help create and\
  \ retain higher-skill, higher-wage jobs, particularly for the unemployed and underemployed\
  \ in the Nation’s most economically distressed regions.  \r\n\r\nTo facilitate CEDS,\
  \ EDA provides Partnership Planning grants to the designated planning organization\
  \ (e.g., District Organization) serving EDA-designated Economic Development Districts\
  \ (EDDs) throughout the Nation.  These planning organizations are typically recognized\
  \ by the State in which they reside as multi-jurisdictional councils of governments,\
  \ regional commissions, or planning and development centers.  Partnership Planning\
  \ grants enable planning organizations to manage and coordinate the development\
  \ and implementation of CEDS.  In addition, EDA provides Partnership Planning grants\
  \ to Indian Tribes to help organize and assist with the implementation of economic\
  \ development activities within their areas.  The majority of funding under the\
  \ Planning program is for Partnership Planning grants for Indian Tribes and EDA-designated\
  \ EDDs.\r\n\r\nThe Planning program also helps support planning organizations and\
  \ other eligible recipients, including District Organizations and Indian Tribes,\
  \ with Short-Term and State Planning efforts in order to stimulate and guide the\
  \ creation and/or retention of higher-skill, higher-wage jobs, particularly for\
  \ the unemployed and underemployed in the Nation’s most economically distressed\
  \ regions.  For example, EDA might provide Short-Term Planning funding to a coalition\
  \ of Tribal and regional organizations to plan a coordinated response to the sudden\
  \ loss of a major employer in the affected area(s).\r\n"
