objective: Teaching and Learning Resources and Curriculum Development programs enhance
  the teaching and study of the humanities by creating new resources, programs, and
  curricula. Humanities Initiatives at Colleges and Universities, Community Colleges,
  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and
  Tribal Colleges and Universities strengthen humanities teaching and learning at
  these institutions. Humanities Connections fosters partnerships between humanities
  faculty and their counterparts in the social and natural sciences and in pre-service
  or professional programs. Dialogues on the Experience of War helps U.S. military
  veterans and others think more deeply about the issues raised by war and military
  service. The Spotlight on Humanities in Higher Education program supports the exploration
  and development of small projects that would benefit underserved populations through
  the teaching and study of the humanities.
