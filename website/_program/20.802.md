objective: To finance eligible vessels and shipyards to promote the growth and modernization
  of the U.S. Merchant Marine and U.S. shipyards. The Federal Ship Financing Program
  (commonly referred to as "Title XI" based on the part of the Merchant Marine Act
  of 1936 that established the program) provides long-term loans by the Maritime Administration
  (MARAD).  Through these loans, the Title XI Program encourages U.S. shipowners to
  obtain new vessels and recondition existing vessels with U.S. shipyards cost effectively.
  It also assists U.S. shipyards with modernizing their facilities for building and
  repairing vessels to strengthen competitiveness and support increased productivity.
