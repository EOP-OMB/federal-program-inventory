objective: The baseline tax system would not allow credits or deductions for particular
  activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax
  uniformly all returns from investment- like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code
  allows a tax credit equal to 1.8 cents times the number of kilowatt hours of electricity
  produced at a qualifying advanced nuclear power facility. A taxpayer may claim no
  more than $125 million per 1,000 megawatts of capacity. The Treasury Department
  may allocate up to 6,000 megawatts of credit-eligible capacity. Any unutilized national
  capacity limitation shall be allocated after December 31, 2020, according to prioritization
  rules set forth by statute.
