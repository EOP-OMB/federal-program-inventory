objective: The Emergency Watershed Protection - Floodplain Easement Program (EWPP-FPE)
  provides an alternative measure to traditional EWPP recovery where it is determined
  that acquiring an easement in lieu of recovery measures is the more economical and
  prudent approach to reducing a threat to life or property (see 7 CFR Part 624).
  The easement must be restored to the extent practicable to the natural environment
  and may include both structural and nonstructural practices to restore the flood
  storage and flow, erosion control, and improve the practical management of the easement.
  Structures, including buildings, within the floodplain easement must be demolished
  and removed, or relocated outside the 100-year floodplain or dam breach inundation
  area.
