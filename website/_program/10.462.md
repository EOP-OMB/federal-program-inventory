objective: "Agriculture producers who have crop insurance coverage on crops in transition\
  \ to organic or a certified organic grain or feed crop are eligible for premium\
  \ assistance from USDA for the 2023 reinsurance year. The Transitional and Organic\
  \ Grower Assistance (TOGA) Program, offered by USDA\u2019s Risk Management Agency\
  \ (RMA), reduces the producer\u2019s overall crop insurance premium bills and helps\
  \ them continue to use organic agricultural systems."
