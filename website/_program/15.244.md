objective: The Bureau of Land Management’s Aquatic Resources Program conserves and
  restores riparian and wetland areas, aquatic habitats, and water resources (hereafter
  referred to as aquatic resources) to provide resource values and ecosystem services
  necessary to achieve the BLM’s multiple use mandate. This program will support projects
  funded under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act PL 117-58, Section 40804(b)
  Ecosystem Restoration and the Inflation Reduction Act PL 117-169. The agencies aquatic
  resources and issues are diverse and include watersheds; riparian-wetland systems;
  springs, streams, rivers, and groundwater; ponds and lakes; fisheries; water quality;
  water rights and uses; and aquatic invasive species. These systems also support
  myriad species of plants, fish, and wildlife; provide ecosystem services such as
  drinking water, pollination, and nutrient cycling; attenuate wildfires, floods,
  and drought; and are key to the vitality of local economies and communities. The
  Program also works to support the thoughtful implementation of other aspects of
  BLM’s mission (e.g., locatable minerals, fluid minerals, range, forestry recreation,
  renewable energy), which could either impact aquatic resources or require restoration
  of such resources to achieve multiple-use and sustained yield management objectives.
