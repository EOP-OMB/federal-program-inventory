objective: "The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s Aquatic Resources Program conserves\
  \ and restores riparian and wetland areas, aquatic habitats, and water resources\
  \ (hereafter referred to as aquatic resources) to provide resource values and ecosystem\
  \ services necessary to achieve the BLM\u2019s multiple use mandate. This program\
  \ will support projects funded under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\
  \ PL 117-58, Section 40804(b) Ecosystem Restoration and the Inflation Reduction\
  \ Act PL 117-169. The agencies aquatic resources and issues are diverse and include\
  \ watersheds; riparian-wetland systems; springs, streams, rivers, and groundwater;\
  \ ponds and lakes; fisheries; water quality; water rights and uses; and aquatic\
  \ invasive species. These systems also support myriad species of plants, fish, and\
  \ wildlife; provide ecosystem services such as drinking water, pollination, and\
  \ nutrient cycling; attenuate wildfires, floods, and drought; and are key to the\
  \ vitality of local economies and communities. The Program also works to support\
  \ the thoughtful implementation of other aspects of BLM\u2019s mission (e.g., locatable\
  \ minerals, fluid minerals, range, forestry recreation, renewable energy), which\
  \ could either impact aquatic resources or require restoration of such resources\
  \ to achieve multiple-use and sustained yield management objectives."
