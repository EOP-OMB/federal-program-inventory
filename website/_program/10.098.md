objective: 'The intended goal of the program is to provide direct reimbursement payments
  to a geographically disadvantaged farmer or rancher who transports an agricultural
  commodity, or inputs used to produce an agricultural commodity during a fiscal year.  Input
  transportation cost are transportation costs of inputs used to produce an agricultural
  commodity including, but not limited to, air, ocean, and land freight of chemicals,
  feed, fertilizer, fuel, seeds, plants, supplies, equipment parts, and other inputs.


  The Farm Service Agency (FSA), Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs (DAFP) administers
  RTCP.  The program will be carried out in the field by FSA State and county committee
  and FSA employees.  State and local governments and their political subdivisions
  and related agencies are not eligible for RTCP payments.'

- description: 'RTCP benefits are calculated based on the transportation costs incurred  by
    producers during the fiscal year.  Due to an increase in funding, RTCP was able
    to raise the payment cap from $8,000 to $11,200 per producer.  This enhancement
    allowed for greater financial support for producers, helping them to better offset
    their transportation costs and easing the financial burden associated with transporting
    agricultural commodities or inputs over long distances.  However, if the total
    claims do not exceed the available funding, a higher payment cap may be considered.


    Enrollment for RTCP for FY 2024 commenced on July 8, 2024, and concluded on September
    30, 2024.  A significant achievement for RTCP this fiscal year was the development
    and implementation of a new software that automated the application process.  This
    innovation replaced the previous lengthy manual process, streamlining operations
    and reducing the time and effort required from both applicants and administrators.


    Additionally, RTCP successfully expedited the timeline for processing payments
    to producers.  As a results, payments are now being processed months earlier than
    in previous years.  This improvement ensures that geographically disadvantaged
    farmers and ranchers receive their reimbursements more promptly, contributing
    to better cash flow management for their operations.


    These accomplishments reflect the programâ€™s commitment to supporting geographically
    disadvantage farmers and ranchers, enhancing operational efficiency, and providing
    more substantial financial assistance.'
