results:
- description: For fiscal year 2022 eleven (11) projects were selected with total
    funding of $1,001,557.  That funding was made available to assist local 501(c)(3)
    status organizations and groups to undertake local AMD reclamation projects to
    improve the water quality of streams impacted by acid mine drainage. The funding
    priorities and technical focus will be to restore streams affected by AMD to a
    level that will support a diverse biological community and provide recreational
    opportunities for the public. Non-Federal entities will use WCAP funds for AMD
    problems related to SMCRA defined abandoned coal mining activities and processes,
    which include remediation of AMD, sources of AMD, and installation of passive
    or active water treatment systems, including repairs and renovations. Projects
    may also include reclamation of lands that are contributing sediment or acid forming
    materials to streams.
